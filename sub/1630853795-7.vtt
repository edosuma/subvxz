08:30.509 --> 08:32.553
This week,
as a part of health class,

08:32.637 --> 08:35.139
each of you will pair up
with a partner to take care

08:35.223 --> 08:36.474
of an infant simulator.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.852
From this moment on,
for the rest of the week,

08:39.936 --> 08:41.896
you are all mommies and daddies.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.105
Imogen: (softly)
On top of everything else.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.941
(indistinct chatter)

08:45.024 --> 08:47.401
(clears throat) Hey.

08:48.194 --> 08:48.527
Uh, wanna team up?

08:50.321 --> 08:50.446
Okay, sure.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.450
-Tag-team or trade-off?
-Trade-off.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.078
I'll watch it tonight.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.080
Cool.

09:02.124 --> 09:05.086
For your final assignment
of the semester,

09:05.169 --> 09:07.421
you'll all be
working individually

09:07.505 --> 09:10.925
to write, direct,
and edit a short film

09:11.008 --> 09:13.427
based on some
aspect of your life.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.472
Something meaningful
and important to you.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.058
(indistinct chatter)

09:19.141 --> 09:21.811
A story only you could tell.

09:22.979 --> 09:23.729

09:23.813 --> 09:26.274
How do you feel
about rollercoasters?

09:26.357 --> 09:27.942
'Cause I was thinking

09:28.025 --> 09:30.111
maybe we could go
to the carnival together.

09:30.194 --> 09:33.155
Sounds... amazing,

09:33.239 --> 09:35.950
but my moms would
never let me go.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.868
What's bad about a carnival?

09:40.621 --> 09:41.539
Nothing.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.295
It's... what happened
to me the last time

09:47.378 --> 09:49.171
I was at the carnival.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.465
<i>I was five years old.</i>

09:51.549 --> 09:54.302
<i>I had wandered off</i>
<i>from my moms</i>

09:54.385 --> 09:55.303
<i>outside the carnival,</i>

09:55.386 --> 09:57.305
<i>when a man came up to me,</i>

09:57.388 --> 10:00.641
<i>offering me some</i> <i>cotton cand,</i>

10:00.725 --> 10:03.394
<i>and then he started</i>
<i>leading me away.</i>

10:03.477 --> 10:04.812
<i>But I wasn't scared.</i>

10:04.895 --> 10:06.480
<i>At least, not until</i>
<i>I saw my moms.</i>

10:06.564 --> 10:08.441
<i>They looked terrified.</i>

10:08.524 --> 10:09.483
(yells) Mouse!

10:09.567 --> 10:11.861
Mouse:
<i>Then they saw me.</i>

10:11.944 --> 10:14.989
<i>And the guy ran off,</i>
<i>left me there.</i>

10:15.072 --> 10:16.949
<i>They never caught him.</i>

10:17.033 --> 10:18.576
Who was he?

10:19.910 --> 10:20.953
A stranger.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.747
Now every year,

10:22.830 --> 10:26.500
we go out of town
during carnival weekend.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.170
Mouse, I'm so sorry
you went through that.

10:29.253 --> 10:32.089
(solemn music playing)

10:40.556 --> 10:42.975

All right, all right,
let's go, let's go!

10:48.314 --> 10:49.940
Come on! Pick it up!

10:52.068 --> 10:53.569
Pick up that pace!
Keep that pace!

10:53.652 --> 10:57.114
-Work! Push, push, push!
-(blows whistle)

10:58.699 --> 10:59.992
-Take five.
-(grunts)

11:00.076 --> 11:02.119
Noa.

11:04.538 --> 11:07.666
How ya doin'?
Are you getting enough rest?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.043
How's your diet?

11:09.126 --> 11:11.712
Uh, not great, to be honest.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.422
(sighs)
My mom just got a job
at Pinball Pizza,

11:13.506 --> 11:15.674
so it's been a lot
of pepperoni recently.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.346
I have a trainer
I want you to meet.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.556
I bet he could get you
where you wanna be.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.974
Thanks, Coach D.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.772
(classical music playing)

11:43.327 --> 11:45.413
-(gasps)
-Hey!

11:45.496 --> 11:47.623
Are you okay?
What was that?

11:49.291 --> 11:51.419
Nothing. A twinge.
I'm fine.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.671
Where's the pain?

11:54.505 --> 11:54.713
My back.

11:59.677 --> 12:00.803
When did the pain start?

12:02.179 --> 12:04.598
Stop for a sec.

12:10.563 --> 12:15.276
I've had it on and off
for years.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.237
Eight years.

12:19.363 --> 12:22.992
You've been dancing
with pain for eight years?

12:23.075 --> 12:23.701
Since your surgery?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.453
Everyone thinks I outgrew it.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.914
Most of the time,
it's manageable,

12:28.998 --> 12:31.584
but every so often
I have a flare.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.543
And then what?

12:32.626 --> 12:36.088
I take Epsom salt baths
and ice.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.425
And if it gets really bad,
I...

12:39.508 --> 12:41.135
I get cortisone shots
at the clinic.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.263
I'm dealing with it, Henry.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.307
I've been dealing with it.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.476
(solemn music playing)

12:52.521 --> 12:53.814
-Wes: You think so?
-Chip: Yeah, she's
really gonna like it.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.524
I think so.
I mean, they're two
of my favorites,

12:55.608 --> 12:56.317
-so, like, I know, obviously.
-(both laughing)

12:56.400 --> 12:58.527
Hey, Tabs. Check it out.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.945
So, I know

13:00.029 --> 13:02.031
what our next double feature
should be.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.074
-You ready?
-Sure, Wes. What movies?

13:04.158 --> 13:06.368
"Last House on the Left"
directed by Wes Craven,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.496
and its unlikely inspiration:

13:08.579 --> 13:10.664
"Virgin Spring,"
directed by Bergman.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.750
Grindhouse meets arthouse.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.918
What do you think?

13:15.252 --> 13:16.587
I-I think both of those movies

13:16.670 --> 13:21.175
depict incredibly
graphic rape scenes.

13:21.258 --> 13:25.054
-(laughs) I think
you're missing the point.
-Okay, which is?

13:25.137 --> 13:26.514
That, yes, these
movies are violent,

13:26.597 --> 13:28.974
but they're also highly moral.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.184
Moral?

13:30.267 --> 13:32.853
-In what universe?
-Uh, look, you have
to look at them

13:32.937 --> 13:35.773
as products of their
respective times.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.525
(Wes laughs)

13:37.608 --> 13:39.485
(muffled)
"Virgin Spring," for example,

13:39.568 --> 13:41.529
was based on the old folktale--

13:55.918 --> 13:57.044
Where, where, where'd you go?

13:57.127 --> 14:00.798
Uh, look, it's good
that you're thinking
about these things,

14:00.881 --> 14:02.800
but if you're gonna
go to film school,

14:02.883 --> 14:05.344
you gotta have
critical distance, too.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.930
My problem with these movies
isn't the fact that they exist.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.100
It's that they're venerated
by you two bozos who have

14:11.183 --> 14:15.062
zero idea what they're
actually saying about
sexual violence.

14:15.145 --> 14:18.232
Do you have any idea
what it's like to watch
those scenes as a woman?

14:18.315 --> 14:19.942
I mean,
did our "Psycho" project

14:20.025 --> 14:22.319
teach you nothing about trauma

14:22.403 --> 14:24.530
and the female body, Chip?

14:25.364 --> 14:26.407
Guess not.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.244
Whatever. Program your
double feature of misogyny.

to call you in.
Come with me.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.449
Actually, I'm waiting
for Deputy Maroon.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.620
That wasn't a request,
Ms. Haworthe.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.545
<i>You and Tyler Marchand</i>
<i>were friends?</i>

21:37.629 --> 21:40.549
Uh, definitely not.

21:40.632 --> 21:44.344
Are you aware that
Tyler hasn't been seen
since Halloween night?

21:44.428 --> 21:47.305
I don't really run in
the same circles as Tyler.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.974
I'm curious.

21:50.308 --> 21:54.563
The last time anyone saw Tyler,
he was at a...

21:54.646 --> 21:57.899
house party, hosted by you
and your friends,

21:57.983 --> 22:01.111
full of underage drinking.

22:01.194 --> 22:06.908
A witness reported seeing
Tyler in a heated argument...

22:06.992 --> 22:08.035
with you.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.162
An argument that
ended in violence.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.164
He was harassing
one of my friends.

22:12.247 --> 22:13.999
So, you assaulted him?

22:14.958 --> 22:17.461
I was protecting
my friend from Tyler,

22:17.544 --> 22:20.213
who was being belligerent
and inappropriate with her.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.591
And I haven't seen him
since that night.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.969
Sorry I can't be more helpful,

22:26.053 --> 22:28.930
but I'm sure he's fine.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.349
Guys like Tyler are always
fine in towns like Millwood

22:31.433 --> 22:34.144
and with guys like you
looking out for them.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.272
Now, I gotta go.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.275
Ms. Haworthe...

22:43.320 --> 22:46.531
what are you even
doing in my station?

22:46.615 --> 22:50.035
I was here to pay one of
my mom's parking tickets,

22:50.118 --> 22:51.244
but I just realized I forgot it.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.707
I'll check in
with Deputy Maroon later.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.295
(door opens, shuts)
