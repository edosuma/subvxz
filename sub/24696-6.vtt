00:00.568 --> 00:02.202
<i>In New York
city's war on crime,</i>

00:02.203 --> 00:05.271
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:07.574
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:07.575 --> 00:09.543
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:12.646 --> 00:16.149
I'm going to connect
the robotic arm to the trocar.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.918
We can start our
robotic prostate surgery.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.121
Bloodless surgery
without scalpel.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.456
- The surgeon controls
the robotic arm

00:23.457 --> 00:25.658
from the console
guided by video.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.327
- Wow, that's amazing.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.295
Surgery of the future,
and it's here now.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.097
- Thanks to your generosity.

00:31.098 --> 00:32.598
Speaking of which,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.200
any hints
on who will receive

00:34.201 --> 00:35.635
this year's Langston grant?

00:35.636 --> 00:38.037
- I'll announce
at the dedication.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.939
- We're all
on pins and needles.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.508
Till tonight.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.676
- So do you think I could
take this thing for a spin?

00:43.677 --> 00:45.011
Looks like a lot of fun.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.647
- Why not?
The patient's already dead.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.158
- Did you read
my amended proposal

00:58.159 --> 00:59.626
on spinal cord regeneration?

00:59.627 --> 01:01.427
- Uh, I did.

01:01.428 --> 01:04.197
- Imagine a world
without wheelchairs,

01:04.197 --> 01:06.966
wounded soldiers
walking again.

01:06.967 --> 01:09.469
The military contract alone
will be worth a fortune.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.937
- It's not about money.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.939
- Says the man
with all the money.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.777
- I see you still
like to make jokes.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.284
- Langston played it
close to the vest.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.119
Any of us could be
the winner tonight.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.787
- Nice for you,
giving him the tour.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.255
Last chance to self-promote.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.024
- Don't worry,
he still hates me.

01:31.025 --> 01:32.725
- You ask me,
Langston's a wannabe.

01:32.726 --> 01:36.162
- Who personally controls
a $20 million research grant.

01:36.163 --> 01:38.731
- Look, he flunked
out of bedford.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.466
He made his fortune
developing a pill coating.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.601
He's a pharmacist.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.403
I don't even
want to go tonight.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.938
- How bad can it be?

01:44.939 --> 01:46.339
Cheese cubes, bad wine,

01:46.340 --> 01:47.373
and we can bring a date.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.808
How 'bout it,
you and me?

01:48.809 --> 01:51.911
- Sorry,
I'm taking my mom.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.947
- You really are
the good girl.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.416
- You should see
these surgical robots, boy.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.185
Tiny cameras
on the instruments.

01:59.186 --> 02:02.589
Like you're actually
inside the human body.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.856
- Fascinating.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.627
That's a nice shirt.
- Yeah?

02:08.628 --> 02:10.128
- Mm-hmm,
I like it.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.298
- Hmm.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.867
You know, I was thinking
I might drive.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.270
Or do you want
to take a limo?

02:17.271 --> 02:18.938
- Why don't you take the car?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.974
I might have to duck out.
I feel a migraine coming on.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.709
- Okay.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.683
Ah.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.118
- Look, daddy, it's you
fighting a dragon.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.987
- Oh, yeah, it looks
just like me too.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.255
You got the horns,
you got the wings,

02:35.256 --> 02:37.457
you got the-
that's the dragon!

02:40.494 --> 02:41.894
- Get going.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.896
And I'm honored
to be here tonight

02:43.897 --> 02:46.532
as head of Langston
pharmaceuticals

02:46.533 --> 02:50.236
to dedicate the Da Vinci
surgical training suite.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.174
And I'm proud to support
our next generation

02:55.175 --> 02:56.509
of researchers,

02:56.510 --> 02:58.177
the best and the brightest.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.946
You young doctors,

02:59.947 --> 03:02.315
who one day
will wipe out disease

03:02.316 --> 03:04.984
and eradicate suffering.

03:08.455 --> 03:12.158
So drum roll please.

03:12.159 --> 03:14.460
It's time to announce
this year's winner

03:14.461 --> 03:16.629
of the Langston
research grant.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.200
Dr. Maya zhuang.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.005
For her work
on creating a vaccine

03:26.006 --> 03:29.375
to help cure
childhood leukemia.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.445
Congratulations,
Dr. zhuang.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.689
- I alady thanked Langston.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.023
- Okay, thank him again.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.858
It's a big honor.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.261
Oh, Maya,
I'm so proud of you.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.563
- Don't try and charm me.
I'm not an idiot, all right?

03:50.564 --> 03:53.499
I know that you pour money
into the institution.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.368
You think that it's gonna
save everything, okay?

03:55.369 --> 03:57.003
No, I don't want
anything from you.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.671
So stay away from me.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.740
Stay away from me,
all right?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.208
- This isn't a good time.
- Shh.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.810
- And you're a phony,
and you're a son of a bitch!

04:03.811 --> 04:06.813
All right?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.652
- Stella, what are you
still doing awake?

04:12.653 --> 04:14.253
- Where's daddy?

04:14.254 --> 04:17.123
- He must still be
at the party.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.993
- I've been calling him.
He won't pick up.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.862
Why are you home so late?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.864
- Uh, get her to bed,
florelle.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.500
- Yes, Mrs. Langston.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.736
- Night-night, Stella.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:46.954 --> 04:50.890
- I--I need to report
a dead body.

04:56.563 --> 05:00.065
<b>Adriano_CSI
www.addic7ed.com

05:41.866 --> 05:43.500
My husband's been missing
all weekend.

05:43.501 --> 05:46.869
He's not answering his cell.
His office hasn't heard.

05:46.870 --> 05:47.770
I'm worried sick.

05:47.771 --> 05:49.339
- And when's the last time
you saw him?

05:49.340 --> 05:50.540
- Friday night.

05:50.541 --> 05:52.375
We were at an event,
the bedford institute.

05:52.376 --> 05:55.044
He's a big donor there.
I left early.

05:55.045 --> 05:56.846
- What time was this?

05:56.847 --> 06:00.483
- About 9:00.
I had a migraine.

06:00.484 --> 06:02.452
When I came home,

06:02.453 --> 06:05.688
my daughter said that he
wasn't answering his cell.

06:05.689 --> 06:08.424
- I don't mean
to be insensitive,

06:08.425 --> 06:09.926
but were the two of you

06:09.927 --> 06:11.628
having problems
in your marriage?

06:11.629 --> 06:13.463
- None. We never fight.

06:13.464 --> 06:14.964
Something must have
happened to him.

06:14.965 --> 06:17.600
- Missing persons
has checked hospitals,

06:17.601 --> 06:19.302
paramedics, the morgue.

06:19.303 --> 06:21.171
No one matching
his description.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.506
- Oh, maybe it was
a carjacking.

06:23.507 --> 06:26.276
Police still haven't
found his Bentley.

06:26.277 --> 06:28.478
- If he had the car,
how did you get home?

06:28.479 --> 06:29.812
- I took the limo.

06:29.813 --> 06:31.181
We went separately.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.749
I had a migraine,
and I wasn't sure

06:32.750 --> 06:35.051
I could manage
all the glad-handing.

06:35.052 --> 06:37.086
- That's a very
impressive collection

06:37.087 --> 06:39.589
of medical instruments.

06:39.590 --> 06:41.558
Your husband's?
- Yes.

06:41.559 --> 06:43.493
Ben made his money
in pharmaceuticals,

06:43.494 --> 06:45.662
but he always dreamed
of being a doctor.

06:47.665 --> 06:49.966
- Mommy, I'm scared
to be alone.

06:49.967 --> 06:51.901
- All right, sweetie,
I'll be right there.

06:51.902 --> 06:56.172
I'm sorry, detectives.

06:56.173 --> 06:58.575
- Ben Langston seems to have
vanished into thin air.

06:58.576 --> 07:01.277
He hasn't bought a plane,
train, or bus ticket.

07:01.278 --> 07:02.712
- Langston's loaded.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.947
Any indication this might
be a kidnapping?

07:03.948 --> 07:05.415
- The wife hasn't
been contacted.

07:05.416 --> 07:07.517
- Any evidence
of foul play?

07:07.518 --> 07:09.485
- Well, the m.E.'S caught some
interesting John does

07:09.486 --> 07:11.020
the last 48 hours,

07:11.021 --> 07:12.822
none of them fitting
Langston's profile.

07:12.823 --> 07:15.458
- Last call on his cell
was to his home at 9:30.

07:15.459 --> 07:16.993
Two hours later,
he shut it off.

07:16.994 --> 07:18.995
- Maybe someone who doesn't
want to be found.

07:18.996 --> 07:20.830
- If he is holed up
with a mistress,

07:20.831 --> 07:22.298
he's being discreet.

07:22.299 --> 07:23.766
- Rich man, a lot to lose,
he'd be careful.

07:23.767 --> 07:25.702
- He may have made
his first mistake.

07:25.703 --> 07:27.036
They found Langston's Bentley

07:27.037 --> 07:29.038
in a parking structure
at pier 92.

07:29.039 --> 07:30.540
- That's a cruise ship
terminal.

07:30.541 --> 07:32.408
See if any boats
left this weekend.

07:34.278 --> 07:35.845
- Thanks.

07:35.846 --> 07:39.515
So four cruise ships left
from the pier this weekend.

07:39.516 --> 07:41.351
Langston's name wasn't on
the passenger list

07:41.352 --> 07:42.819
for any of them.

07:42.820 --> 07:44.420
Parking structure
security cameras

07:44.421 --> 07:47.156
caught the car's entry
at 2:40 A.M. Saturday,

07:47.157 --> 07:50.093
but the driver
was obscured.

07:50.094 --> 07:53.129
- You know,
Langston is 6'2".

07:53.130 --> 07:55.265
He's a little smaller
than I am.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.667
This seat has been moved in.
He didn't drive this car.

07:57.668 --> 08:01.337
There's a very nice feature
about this particular vehicle,

08:01.338 --> 08:04.741
that the trunk is big enough
to fit a body.

08:12.049 --> 08:16.619
- Smells like formaldehyde.

08:16.620 --> 08:17.954
- If there was a body
in this trunk,

08:17.955 --> 08:20.356
it was already embalmed.

08:20.357 --> 08:25.228
A John Doe turned up in
riverside park Saturday morning,

08:25.229 --> 08:26.729
unusual cuts on his body.

08:26.730 --> 08:28.531
He was slit
from stem to stern

08:28.532 --> 08:31.100
like a dissection.

08:33.736 --> 08:36.005
- You hear about Ben Langston
taking a powder?

08:36.006 --> 08:38.073
- No.

08:38.075 --> 08:40.243
- Front-page news.

08:40.244 --> 08:44.013
You gotta get out
of this lab more.

08:44.014 --> 08:46.282
I could
help you with that.

08:46.283 --> 08:48.418
- I'd rather hang out
with the rats.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.194
- What did he want?

08:58.195 --> 09:00.863
- Nothing.
He's a jerk.

09:00.864 --> 09:04.801
- You know, that was
really nice the other night.

09:04.802 --> 09:07.270
What I said,
it's just between us.

09:07.271 --> 09:09.172
- Of course.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.607
- Maybe we can do it
again sometime.

09:11.608 --> 09:13.242
- I don't know, Sam.

09:13.243 --> 09:15.111
I have a lot
of work to do.

09:22.219 --> 09:26.389
- Well, in all my years
this is a first.

09:26.390 --> 09:29.092
Body's already
been dissected.

09:29.093 --> 09:32.261
- I smell formaldehyde.
Embalming fluid?

09:32.262 --> 09:33.529
- Mm-hmm.

09:33.530 --> 09:35.231
This gentleman's been dead
over a year.

09:35.232 --> 09:37.333
Embalmed, refrigerated.

09:37.334 --> 09:39.802
- So a medical school cadaver?

09:39.803 --> 09:41.471
- Well, either that
or an escapee

09:41.472 --> 09:43.106
from someone else's morgue.

09:43.107 --> 09:44.607
- Bedford institute
has a medical school.

09:44.608 --> 09:46.008
They must use cadavers.

09:46.009 --> 09:48.277
- He was found propped up
in riverside park.

09:48.278 --> 09:49.579
He was wearing a suit.

09:49.580 --> 09:52.915
- Uh, it's pink.

09:52.916 --> 09:56.219
The missing persons report
on Langston

09:56.220 --> 10:01.257
said he was wearing
a pink dress shirt,

10:01.258 --> 10:03.526
dark-gray pinstripe suit.

10:03.527 --> 10:06.929
- Let's find out if bedford's
lost any bodies.

10:06.930 --> 10:08.965
- Oh, yeah, that's popeye.

10:08.966 --> 10:11.000
- Popeye?

10:11.001 --> 10:12.769
- For the anchor tattoo
on his biceps.

10:12.770 --> 10:15.805
The students usually give their
cadavers a nickname.

10:15.806 --> 10:19.175
His real name was
Joseph slobotnik.

10:19.176 --> 10:22.278
He was in the Navy.
Died of meningitis.

10:22.279 --> 10:23.980
His family donated
his body to bedford.

10:23.981 --> 10:26.449
- Any idea how Mr. slobotnik
ended up in riverside park

10:26.450 --> 10:27.950
Saturday morning?

10:27.951 --> 10:30.787
- There is a code of ethics
regarding cadavers,

10:30.788 --> 10:33.823
but it's a high-stress
environment

10:33.824 --> 10:35.958
and we do have pranks.

10:35.959 --> 10:38.294
- Oh, you have--
you have pranks.

10:38.295 --> 10:40.496
What kind of pranks?

10:40.497 --> 10:43.065
- Taking a cadaver
out to a party.

10:43.066 --> 10:44.200
Posing with them.

10:44.201 --> 10:46.536
Putting the pictures
up on Facebook.

10:48.839 --> 10:50.907
- Try and stay
in one place.

10:50.908 --> 10:54.243
So who has access

10:54.244 --> 10:56.012
to this cadaver room?

10:56.013 --> 10:57.413
- Well, we have
a key code lock,

10:57.414 --> 10:58.648
but the number
gets out, so...

10:58.649 --> 11:00.550
- We'll need to look
at the refrigerator

11:00.551 --> 11:02.885
where you usually store
Mr. slobotnik.

11:02.886 --> 11:04.253
- Of course,

11:04.254 --> 11:05.621
but it's the end
of the semester.

11:05.622 --> 11:08.191
Slobotnik's cadaver
was scheduled to be cremated

11:08.192 --> 11:09.926
on--today.

11:09.927 --> 11:12.929
His coffin was picked up
by a driver

11:12.930 --> 11:14.530
from woodhurst funeral home
in yonkers

11:14.531 --> 11:16.632
at 6:00 this morning.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.503
- Some families
who have donated cadavers

11:20.504 --> 11:22.371
elect to have a funeral.

11:22.372 --> 11:25.708
Some just want us
to dispose of the remains.

11:25.709 --> 11:28.744
Joseph slobotnik's
getting the full service.

11:28.745 --> 11:31.080
- The body you cremated,

11:31.081 --> 11:32.448
we have reason to believe

11:32.449 --> 11:34.349
it might not be
Mr. slobotnik.

11:34.350 --> 11:37.252
- Um, that's, um,

11:37.253 --> 11:38.387
that's distressing.

11:38.388 --> 11:40.289
- Now where are the remains?

11:45.061 --> 11:47.463
- What am I going
to tell the family?

11:47.464 --> 11:49.231
- Tell them they might want
to reschedule.

11:53.403 --> 11:54.970
- Hello, Ben Langston.

11:59.410 --> 12:02.344
The lab couldn't pull
any DNA from the cremated ashes,

12:02.345 --> 12:04.446
but they did recover
a titanium pin.

12:04.447 --> 12:06.615
The serial number
matches a pin

12:06.616 --> 12:09.117
inserted into Langston's foot
15 years a ago.

12:09.118 --> 12:11.186
- So the ashes are Langston.

12:11.187 --> 12:12.621
So somebody killed him,

12:12.622 --> 12:14.523
switched his body
with a cadaver?

12:14.524 --> 12:16.291
That's pretty elaborate.

12:16.292 --> 12:18.527
- Killer dressed the body
in Langston's clothes.

12:18.528 --> 12:20.161
He propped him up
in the park,

12:20.162 --> 12:22.130
make it look
like a prank,

12:22.131 --> 12:24.799
buy time while
Langston's body

12:24.800 --> 12:26.067
was being cremated.

12:26.068 --> 12:28.403
- Congratulations,
it's a homicide.

12:28.404 --> 12:30.639
- With no crime scene,
no cause of death, no motive,

12:30.640 --> 12:32.107
and our victim was last seen

12:32.108 --> 12:33.608
at an event
with 100 suspects.

12:33.609 --> 12:35.544
- You'll earn
your paycheck this week.

12:35.545 --> 12:37.112
Now wasn't Langston
at that event

12:37.113 --> 12:39.781
to award a $20 million grant?

12:39.782 --> 12:42.350
Maybe one of the losers
took offense.

12:45.354 --> 12:47.722
- Langston's dead?
That's terrible.

12:49.825 --> 12:52.561
- Did you know him well?

12:52.562 --> 12:54.296
- Just by reputation.

12:54.297 --> 12:56.598
He did a lot for bedford.

12:56.599 --> 12:58.233
- I read your grant proposal.

12:58.234 --> 13:00.368
It was very impressive.

13:00.369 --> 13:03.204
A successful
plaque-removing drug,

13:03.205 --> 13:05.574
that could eventually
eliminate heart disease.

13:05.575 --> 13:06.975
- Yeah, well,
coronary disease

13:06.976 --> 13:08.476
is the number one
killer in the world,

13:08.477 --> 13:10.579
and it's entirely
preventable.

13:10.580 --> 13:12.314
Closer in our sights
than curing cancer.

13:12.315 --> 13:14.082
- You must have been
disappointed

13:14.083 --> 13:17.052
when you didn't hear
your name called.

13:17.053 --> 13:18.987
- Part of the game.

13:18.988 --> 13:20.355
- Friday night,
what time did you leave?

13:20.356 --> 13:21.790
- Around 10:00
I went home.

13:21.791 --> 13:24.059
- Can anyone verify that?

13:24.060 --> 13:25.760
- Are you asking me if--

13:27.930 --> 13:29.698
I live alone.

13:29.699 --> 13:31.666
I did go out
after midnight

13:31.667 --> 13:34.235
to meet a colleague
at a bar, Dr. zhuang.

13:34.236 --> 13:36.271
- Maya zhuang,
the grant winner?

13:36.272 --> 13:37.706
- Yeah.

13:37.707 --> 13:40.575
- You must have had
a lot to talk about.

13:40.576 --> 13:43.411
- I congratulated her.

13:43.412 --> 13:45.246
Look, I have to go.

13:45.247 --> 13:48.216
I'm sorry, I have a seminar
at Sloan-kettering.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.320
- I'm late for
an appointment off-campus.

13:52.321 --> 13:53.888
- This is not gonna take
a lot of your time.

13:53.889 --> 13:56.324
- Friday night, did you
meet up with Dr. Harris?

13:56.325 --> 13:57.592
- Sam? Yes.

13:57.593 --> 13:58.960
At McSorley's
for a few drinks.

13:58.961 --> 14:00.295
- What time was this?

14:00.296 --> 14:01.896
- Oh, I don't know.
Midnight maybe.

14:01.897 --> 14:03.732
- Till when?
- Past one.

14:03.733 --> 14:06.234
The push for grant money
is intense.

14:06.235 --> 14:08.570
I thought we needed
to take a break.

14:08.571 --> 14:10.572
- Sam say anything about
Ben Langston that night?

14:10.573 --> 14:14.209
- Well, obviously we talked
about the grant.

14:14.210 --> 14:16.011
- Hey.
- That's my mom.

14:16.012 --> 14:17.178
- Maya, hi.

14:17.179 --> 14:18.513
- Hi.
These are detectives.

14:18.514 --> 14:20.515
They're asking about
Ben Langston.

14:20.516 --> 14:23.184
- Oh, it's a terrible thing.
Do you know what happened?

14:23.185 --> 14:26.187
- Oh, uh, well, we're
still investigating.

14:26.188 --> 14:27.455
- Well, they should talk
to the Dean

14:27.456 --> 14:29.057
about the incident
last year.

14:29.058 --> 14:30.058
- I don't think that has
anything to do with this.

14:30.059 --> 14:32.527
- Ben Langston was furious.

14:32.528 --> 14:33.928
- What incident was this?

14:33.929 --> 14:35.930
- One of the researchers,
Theo Kendall,

14:35.931 --> 14:37.799
made a joke
at the benefit last year.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.768
He was reprimanded
by Dean Johnson.

14:39.769 --> 14:42.504
- Theo Kendall,
one of the grant finalists?

14:42.505 --> 14:45.974
- I'm sure it all blew over.

14:45.975 --> 14:47.475
- Maya zhuang
needs to relax.

14:47.476 --> 14:49.744
She's had a stick up her ass
about me for years.

14:49.745 --> 14:51.980
- Oh, you mean
the harassment complaint

14:51.981 --> 14:53.214
she filed against you?

14:53.215 --> 14:54.683
- It was dropped.
I was joking.

14:54.684 --> 14:56.851
- You put an embalmed penis
on her desk.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.820
Sounds hilarious.

14:58.821 --> 15:00.455
- Come on,
it was fun.

15:00.456 --> 15:03.125
Work is stressful.
Laughter breaks the tension.

15:03.126 --> 15:04.459
- Yeah.

15:04.460 --> 15:06.595
We're more interested
in the laughs you got

15:06.596 --> 15:08.263
at Langston's expense.

15:08.264 --> 15:09.564
- The prank you pulled.

15:09.565 --> 15:11.600
The Dean was mortified
when she told us about it.

15:11.601 --> 15:12.868
She was more upset
to find out

15:12.869 --> 15:15.003
you still had this up
on your Facebook page.

15:15.004 --> 15:17.639
A prank with a cadaver
as Lauren Langston?

15:17.640 --> 15:21.777
You slipped this picture
into a fundraising reel

15:21.778 --> 15:23.512
in front of a room full

15:23.513 --> 15:25.314
of board members
and benefactors?

15:25.315 --> 15:26.615
- That's what
this is about?

15:26.616 --> 15:28.050
Again, just a joke,

15:28.051 --> 15:30.385
and I apologized.

15:30.386 --> 15:32.421
- Langston didn't seem
too amused.

15:32.422 --> 15:36.158
He pulled you
from the running

15:36.159 --> 15:37.326
for the grant last year.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.661
- His money,
his prerogative.

15:39.662 --> 15:43.832
- And then passed you
over this year again.

15:43.833 --> 15:46.001
- You guys are sharp.

15:46.002 --> 15:48.637
- You know, jokesters,

15:48.638 --> 15:51.873
they have trouble
with authority.

15:51.874 --> 15:54.176
Maybe you resent Langston.

15:54.177 --> 15:56.745
You know, you resent the fact
that your career

15:56.746 --> 15:59.214
depends on the whim of these
deep-pocket benefactors,

15:59.215 --> 16:03.819
these non-doctors who couldn't
possibly understand your work.

16:03.820 --> 16:06.121
- I had no problem
with Langston.

16:06.122 --> 16:08.590
- This is a nice piece.

16:08.591 --> 16:12.394
Langston, he also collects
antique instruments.

16:12.395 --> 16:14.563
- Oh, I didn't know.

16:14.564 --> 16:17.699
- Yeah.

16:19.635 --> 16:21.636
Theo Kendall showed us
his antique microscope.

16:21.637 --> 16:24.506
Was that a gift
from your husband?

16:24.507 --> 16:27.042
- It might have been.
Ben was generous that way.

16:27.043 --> 16:29.010
- Even after Theo
dressed up a cadaver

16:29.011 --> 16:30.345
with your name on it?

16:30.346 --> 16:33.849
- Ben was upset
about that prank,

16:33.850 --> 16:35.984
but I actually
thought it was funny.

16:35.985 --> 16:38.420
- Is that why he passed over
Dr. Kendall

16:38.421 --> 16:39.554
for the research grant?

16:39.555 --> 16:41.056
- Ben was a fair person.

16:41.057 --> 16:42.824
He judged the projects
on their merits.

16:42.825 --> 16:45.227
- Theo Kendall
might not have thought so.

16:47.663 --> 16:49.931
- You don't believe
that Dr. Kendall--

16:49.932 --> 16:51.700
- we think someone at bedford

16:51.701 --> 16:53.235
murdered your husband,
Mrs. Langston.

16:53.236 --> 16:55.237
- But it wasn't
Theo Kendall.

16:55.238 --> 16:56.538
- It wasn't?

16:56.539 --> 16:58.740
How do you know?

16:58.741 --> 17:03.178
- He just doesn't
seem the type.

17:05.181 --> 17:07.648
- She's in her room
reading Harry Potter.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.785
You said I could leave
at 6:00.

17:09.786 --> 17:11.453
- Oh, if you have to go, go.

17:11.454 --> 17:14.388
- Do you mind if I use
your bathroom?

17:14.390 --> 17:17.291
- Um, down the hall.

17:26.202 --> 17:29.304
- My niece loves
Harry Potter.

17:29.305 --> 17:31.773
- My favorite character
is Hermione.

17:31.774 --> 17:34.109
- Mine too.

17:46.456 --> 17:49.524
I'm really sorry
about your dad, Stella.

17:49.525 --> 17:52.427
- I miss him.

17:52.428 --> 17:56.097
- Friday night
when you called him,

17:56.098 --> 18:01.102
was that because you were
scared to be alone?

18:01.103 --> 18:05.907
Your mom was home though,
right?

18:05.908 --> 18:07.442
Was it just your nanny?

18:07.443 --> 18:08.944
Is that why
you were afraid?

18:08.945 --> 18:12.214
- I woke up
and went into the room,

18:12.215 --> 18:14.449
but the bed was empty.

18:14.450 --> 18:16.284
Then my mom came home.

18:16.285 --> 18:18.453
I could tell
she had a playdate.

18:18.454 --> 18:21.122
She seemed fuzzy.

18:21.123 --> 18:23.225
- Playdate.

18:23.226 --> 18:25.126
With who?

18:25.127 --> 18:27.729
- She was always talking
to him on the phone.

18:27.730 --> 18:30.699
I think his name was Theo.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.901
- Theo?

18:37.321 --> 18:39.355
My client
lied to the police

18:39.356 --> 18:41.523
to protect the reputation
of a married woman.

18:41.524 --> 18:44.726
He was with Lauren Langston
Friday night.

18:44.727 --> 18:46.161
He still coulda
killed her husband

18:46.162 --> 18:47.729
after his rendezvous.

18:47.730 --> 18:50.131
- I didn't murder Langston.

18:50.132 --> 18:51.333
- You were ang at him

18:51.334 --> 18:52.701
for passing you over
for the grant.

18:52.702 --> 18:54.436
Is that why you
seduced his wife?

18:54.437 --> 18:56.404
- I don't know, maybe.

18:56.405 --> 18:57.572
I seduce a lot of women.

18:57.573 --> 18:59.007
- Because it's fun?

18:59.008 --> 19:00.375
- Is that necessary?

19:00.376 --> 19:02.110
We're here to cooperate,
detective.

19:02.111 --> 19:03.411
- It's all right, Serena.

19:03.412 --> 19:05.347
Yeah, sex is fun.

19:05.348 --> 19:07.249
And you know what,
killing somebody,

19:07.250 --> 19:08.984
that doesn't sound fun.

19:08.985 --> 19:11.253
- Not like playing pranks
with dead bodies?

19:11.254 --> 19:14.189
- That doesn't make me
a murderer.

19:14.190 --> 19:15.590
- Theo didn't do it.

19:15.591 --> 19:17.526
He and I were together
Friday night

19:17.527 --> 19:20.529
at the ritz-Carlton.

19:20.530 --> 19:23.398
- Driver told us
he dropped you off at 9:30.

19:23.399 --> 19:25.100
- I took a cab
to the hotel.

19:25.101 --> 19:27.035
My nanny covered for me.

19:27.036 --> 19:28.370
If Ben had come home,

19:28.371 --> 19:30.705
she would have said
I was at my sister's.

19:30.706 --> 19:32.607
- We can provide evidence
that my client

19:32.608 --> 19:35.143
and Theo Kendall
were in room 734

19:35.144 --> 19:38.046
at the ritz-Carlton
from 10:00 until 3:00 A.M.

19:38.047 --> 19:39.381
Saturday morning.

19:39.382 --> 19:41.216
- I lied to protect Stella.

19:41.217 --> 19:43.385
I'm guilty of infidelity.

19:43.386 --> 19:45.320
I'm not a murderer.

19:45.321 --> 19:46.588
I loved Ben.

19:46.589 --> 19:51.927
- Another marriage
built on true love.

19:51.928 --> 19:54.563
We get a lot of that
around here.

19:57.166 --> 20:00.468
- Ben was just so...

20:00.469 --> 20:01.836
Single-minded.

20:01.837 --> 20:03.638
He was so consumed
with his legacy.

20:03.639 --> 20:06.207
- You said that you two
never fought.

20:06.208 --> 20:07.676
- That's true.

20:07.677 --> 20:10.045
- Is that because
there was no passion?

20:10.046 --> 20:11.846
Dr. Kendall make you laugh?

20:14.850 --> 20:17.385
- I went to his lab

20:17.386 --> 20:21.423
to tell him I wasn't
offended by the prank.

20:21.424 --> 20:24.326
And we started talking,

20:24.327 --> 20:27.495
and...

20:27.496 --> 20:30.131
Yes, he made me laugh.

20:30.132 --> 20:31.833
- You were at the event.

20:31.834 --> 20:34.135
You have access
to the cadaver room.

20:34.136 --> 20:36.905
You're a trained surgeon.
How'd you kill him?

20:36.906 --> 20:38.573
You slit his throat
with a scalpel?

20:38.574 --> 20:41.743
- When I left the party,
Langston was alive.

20:41.744 --> 20:45.180
Alive and well,
talking to Sam Harris.

20:45.181 --> 20:47.015
- What about?

20:47.016 --> 20:48.650
- I don't know,
but they were intense.

20:48.651 --> 20:50.352
I figured Langston
wouldn't notice

20:50.353 --> 20:53.455
that I followed his wife
out of the room.

20:53.456 --> 20:55.190
- Yes, I did speak
to Langston that night.

20:55.191 --> 20:56.858
So did a lot of people.

20:56.859 --> 21:00.328
- We have a witness says
you two were pretty heated.

21:00.329 --> 21:03.098
- Okay, look, I may have
called Langston a phony,

21:03.099 --> 21:05.600
but in private,
to colleagues.

21:05.601 --> 21:07.936
- Why a phony?

21:07.937 --> 21:09.838
- He said he wanted
to help people,

21:09.839 --> 21:11.840
and I think for him
it was more about ego.

21:11.841 --> 21:15.343
- Is that what you talked about
with him on Friday night?

21:15.344 --> 21:18.713
- No.

21:18.714 --> 21:20.215
- What did you talk about?

21:20.216 --> 21:22.617
- I told him I thought
the leukemia vaccine

21:22.618 --> 21:24.386
was a worthy project.

21:24.387 --> 21:28.356
And no,
no one can confirm that.

21:28.357 --> 21:31.626
Look, are you asking me
if I killed Langston?

21:31.627 --> 21:33.528
- Did you?
- No.

21:33.529 --> 21:35.764
I had no reason to.

21:35.765 --> 21:37.699
And I feel like I've
wasted enough brain cells

21:37.700 --> 21:41.036
talking about the man.

21:41.037 --> 21:43.772
- So Sam Harris and Ben Langston
do have some history.

21:43.773 --> 21:45.874
Sam was arrested
for trespassing

21:45.875 --> 21:48.877
six years ago
at Langston pharmaceuticals.

21:48.878 --> 21:50.779
A protest against
animal testing.

21:50.780 --> 21:52.814
- That's interesting.

21:52.815 --> 21:54.349
Medical researchers
like Sam,

21:54.350 --> 21:55.617
they rely
on animal testing.

21:55.618 --> 21:56.851
- The charges were dropped.

21:56.852 --> 21:58.253
A woman was arrested with him,

21:58.254 --> 22:00.321
Claire Morton.

22:00.322 --> 22:01.856
- I met Sam on the bus.

22:01.857 --> 22:03.692
I thought he was cool,
a med student.

22:03.693 --> 22:05.160
We dated a while.

22:05.161 --> 22:06.961
- How did you two end up
getting arrested

22:06.962 --> 22:08.596
at Langston pharmaceuticals?

22:08.597 --> 22:10.899
- I heard they were testing
drugs on, like, monkeys,

22:10.900 --> 22:12.300
which is uncool.

22:12.301 --> 22:14.969
So I staged a protest.
Sam came with.

22:14.970 --> 22:18.940
- Sam was against
animal testing?

22:18.941 --> 22:20.141
- He said he was.

22:20.142 --> 22:21.743
I don't know,
he was pretty fragile.

22:21.744 --> 22:23.311
His mom had just died.

22:23.312 --> 22:25.613
- So what happened
at the protest?

22:25.614 --> 22:27.148
- A bunch of us
picketed the entrance,

22:27.149 --> 22:29.317
signs, chants, demanded
to see Ben Langston.

22:29.318 --> 22:31.753
After a few hours, I figured
we'd made our point.

22:31.754 --> 22:32.954
- Langston ever show?

22:32.955 --> 22:35.256
- No.
And Sam got weird.

22:35.257 --> 22:36.991
He refused to leave,

22:36.992 --> 22:38.927
said Langston
couldn't treat us like that.

22:38.928 --> 22:40.628
I guess his mom
used to work with the guy.

22:40.629 --> 22:42.664
Anyway, Sam and I broke up

22:42.665 --> 22:44.466
when I saw
the white mice in his lab.

22:44.467 --> 22:47.402
Hewore they were happy,
but their eyes looked sad.

22:50.106 --> 22:52.273
- Even he wants out
of the rain.

22:53.976 --> 22:56.611
- Thanks.
Regina Harris, Sam's mother,

22:56.612 --> 22:58.580
worked at quoro labs
in Philadelphia

22:58.581 --> 23:01.249
from 1982 until 1986,

23:01.250 --> 23:03.618
the same time
as Ben Langston.

23:03.619 --> 23:06.488
- So his wife said
that Ben was dating

23:06.489 --> 23:08.356
a lab tech when they met.

23:08.357 --> 23:11.359
- Yeah. Regina and Ben
both quit quoro in 1986.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.995
Ben moved to New York,
married Lauren.

23:13.996 --> 23:16.030
- Sam Harris was born
nine months later

23:16.031 --> 23:19.100
in Philadelphia.

23:19.101 --> 23:22.537
When'd you find out that
Ben Langston was your father?

23:22.538 --> 23:24.472
- He's not my father.

23:24.473 --> 23:26.007
- He and your mother dated.

23:26.008 --> 23:28.543
You were born nine months
after they broke up.

23:28.544 --> 23:31.112
- I meant he's not
a real father in any sense.

23:31.113 --> 23:32.881
He's a sperm donor.

23:32.882 --> 23:36.518
He left me and my mother
like--like trash.

23:36.519 --> 23:39.721
- That's what
your mother told you,

23:39.722 --> 23:41.689
that she felt abandoned
by Langston?

23:41.690 --> 23:43.024
- She was abandoned.

23:43.025 --> 23:44.492
- Did she ever try
to contact him

23:44.493 --> 23:45.693
to get child support?

23:45.694 --> 23:46.828
- Yeah, of course she did.

23:46.829 --> 23:48.630
She wanted
what's best for me.

23:48.631 --> 23:52.100
- So Langston,
he just ignored you?

23:52.101 --> 23:54.302
- He couldn't be bothered.

23:54.303 --> 23:55.637
- He denied you.

23:55.638 --> 23:57.939
- He denied us both.

23:57.940 --> 24:00.775
- So you spent
your whole life

24:00.776 --> 24:02.210
trying to be better
than him.

24:02.211 --> 24:03.745
You became a doctor,

24:03.746 --> 24:05.246
a brilliant researcher.

24:05.247 --> 24:07.248
Everything that he wasn't.

24:07.249 --> 24:08.983
- I am better than him.
- Hey, hey, sit down.

24:08.984 --> 24:10.518
Sit down.

24:17.359 --> 24:21.429
So what happened
Friday night?

24:21.430 --> 24:23.398
He denied you the grant,

24:23.399 --> 24:25.400
and that was
the last straw for you?

24:25.401 --> 24:28.269
He's denied you
your whole life,

24:28.270 --> 24:29.737
so you confronted him.

24:29.738 --> 24:32.674
- I didn't even
want his money,

24:32.675 --> 24:36.444
his precious grant.

24:36.445 --> 24:38.446
Listening to him
spew his lies,

24:38.447 --> 24:41.149
how he cares
about people.

24:41.150 --> 24:43.985
I said he should have
cared for my mother,

24:43.986 --> 24:46.120
for me.

24:46.121 --> 24:48.990
- Maybe he didn't know
you even existed.

24:48.991 --> 24:50.959
- Are you calling
my mother a liar?

24:50.960 --> 24:52.560
- We checked records.

24:52.561 --> 24:54.829
No request
for child support.

24:54.830 --> 24:57.565
No public record
of Langston as your father.

24:57.566 --> 24:58.800
- He is a monster.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.969
He used my mother.

25:00.970 --> 25:02.337
He got her pregnant

25:02.338 --> 25:04.272
and then ran off
and married somebody else.

25:04.273 --> 25:08.810
I listened to her cry
every single night.

25:08.811 --> 25:12.814
Look, he got
what he deserved.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.215
I hate him.

25:16.218 --> 25:18.620
- Your mother,
she loved you a lot.

25:18.621 --> 25:20.488
- She did.

25:20.489 --> 25:24.259
- Why wouldn't she try
to get something from him?

25:24.260 --> 25:25.693
Anything?

25:25.694 --> 25:27.095
Get some child support

25:27.096 --> 25:29.097
from a multimillionaire
father.

25:29.098 --> 25:32.734
Why wouldn't she try
to get anything?

25:32.735 --> 25:36.571
She poisoned you
against him.

25:36.572 --> 25:38.206
You killed Ben Langston.

25:44.413 --> 25:46.080
- So Sam Harris
hated Ben Langston.

25:46.081 --> 25:47.749
Enough to kill him?

25:47.750 --> 25:52.053
- Parental alienation
is akin to brainwashing.

25:52.054 --> 25:54.923
If he grew up hearing
that Langston was a bastard,

25:54.924 --> 25:56.591
true or not,
he believes it.

25:56.592 --> 25:58.426
- Maybe Langston
really was a bastard.

25:58.427 --> 26:00.762
- That kinda thing is hard
to keep secret in a marriage.

26:00.763 --> 26:03.731
Find out if Mrs. Langston
can shed some light.

26:03.732 --> 26:06.467
- Ben had an illegitimate son?

26:06.468 --> 26:08.236
This is news to me.

26:08.237 --> 26:09.570
- That's something a husband

26:09.571 --> 26:11.072
might want to hide
from his wife.

26:11.073 --> 26:13.274
- No, no, Ben must not
have known.

26:13.275 --> 26:14.943
- Well, you said yourself
that your marriage

26:14.944 --> 26:17.645
wasn't ideal.

26:17.646 --> 26:21.015
- Ben was all about
his legacy.

26:21.016 --> 26:23.351
He adored Stella,

26:23.352 --> 26:26.187
but he would have done
anything for a boy.

26:26.188 --> 26:28.189
We tried but--

26:28.190 --> 26:31.225
if Ben knew he had a son
who was a doctor,

26:31.226 --> 26:32.894
he would have given him
grant money

26:32.895 --> 26:35.430
from here to kingdom come.

26:35.431 --> 26:37.165
- No, I don't believe you.

26:37.166 --> 26:39.701
My mom said that she
begged him to help us.

26:39.702 --> 26:41.736
- Did she show you
any evidence of that?

26:41.737 --> 26:43.071
Phone calls, letters?

26:43.072 --> 26:44.839
- She didn't have
to prove herself.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.574
- Did she hire a lawyer?

26:46.575 --> 26:48.676
- We could not afford
a lawyer.

26:48.677 --> 26:50.411
- Please, do you know
how many lawyers

26:50.412 --> 26:53.047
would take a paternity case
against a millionaire

26:53.048 --> 26:54.382
on contingency?

26:54.383 --> 26:56.985
- How did your mother react

26:56.986 --> 26:59.887
when you told her
you applied to bedford?

26:59.888 --> 27:02.924
- She wasn't happy.

27:02.925 --> 27:04.492
It was empty nest anxiety.

27:04.493 --> 27:06.227
- She didn't want you
to meet Langston.

27:06.228 --> 27:09.664
She was afraid that he was gonna
take you away from her.

27:09.665 --> 27:12.533
That's why she indoctrinated
you to hate him.

27:12.534 --> 27:15.903
You killed a man

27:15.904 --> 27:19.140
who would have loved
to have you for a son.

27:22.578 --> 27:25.246
- I pulled him aside that
night after the reception,

27:25.247 --> 27:27.648
and I yelled at him.

27:27.649 --> 27:30.685
I was angry.

27:30.686 --> 27:33.688
I told him
that I was his son.

27:41.196 --> 27:43.464
- What did he say?
What did he do?

27:43.465 --> 27:46.367
- He tried to hug me.

27:49.738 --> 27:51.539
Said he'd fund all
of my research

27:51.540 --> 27:54.475
as his top priority.

27:54.476 --> 27:56.210
I called him
a son of a bitch,

27:56.211 --> 27:57.779
and I left.

27:57.780 --> 28:00.415
But I did not kill him.

28:03.452 --> 28:06.254
Look, you can ask Maya
if you don't believe me.

28:10.459 --> 28:12.326
- You told Maya?

28:14.296 --> 28:17.799
- I never told anyone,
just--just Maya.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.768
She called me that night
to get a drink.

28:20.769 --> 28:24.105
I told her that Langston
was my biological father.

28:24.106 --> 28:27.875
- When you met her
at the bar?

28:27.876 --> 28:29.143
- Yeah.

28:29.144 --> 28:31.345
Yeah, maybe it was
the beers,

28:31.346 --> 28:33.781
maybe it was just cause
she was acting

28:33.782 --> 28:35.049
like she liked me for once.

28:35.050 --> 28:37.485
- She didn't usually
like you?

28:37.486 --> 28:39.153
- No.

28:39.154 --> 28:41.189
No.

28:41.190 --> 28:42.557
Not like that.

28:42.558 --> 28:45.293
Affectionate.

28:45.294 --> 28:46.794
I thought maybe--

28:46.795 --> 28:48.763
- what, that you'd
get lucky or...

28:50.933 --> 28:53.534
- I misread the signals.

28:53.535 --> 28:57.405
A couple of days later,
we were back to the friend zone.

28:57.406 --> 29:00.475
I don't know,
maybe she was just being nice.

29:00.476 --> 29:02.343
She could tell
I needed somebody to talk to,

29:02.344 --> 29:04.812
so...

29:04.813 --> 29:07.248
- If Sam Harris
killed Langston,

29:07.249 --> 29:09.817
why would he confess
to Maya zhuang

29:09.818 --> 29:12.153
that Langston was his father?

29:12.154 --> 29:14.288
- He was shaken,
not thinking clearly,

29:14.289 --> 29:18.025
and he thought
she was his alibi.

29:18.026 --> 29:21.395
- Except she called him.

29:25.446 --> 29:26.813
Yes, Maya's here.

29:26.814 --> 29:28.681
She's studying.

29:28.682 --> 29:30.984
- We just have
a few questions.

29:30.985 --> 29:32.886
- I told Maya she should
stay away from work

29:32.887 --> 29:35.220
until they catch
whoever did this.

29:35.221 --> 29:36.255
Maya.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.927
- Well, I already told you

29:41.928 --> 29:43.963
I called Sam because
things had been tense.

29:43.964 --> 29:46.332
- To clear the air after
the grant competition.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.067
- That's right.

29:48.068 --> 29:50.302
- It must have been
a surprise for you to learn

29:50.303 --> 29:52.304
that Dr. Harris
was Langston's son.

29:52.305 --> 29:54.340
- I guess he told you that.

29:54.341 --> 29:58.744
Yes, it was pretty shocking.

29:58.745 --> 30:00.079
What's this about?

30:00.080 --> 30:01.213
Do you think Sam
killed Langston?

30:01.214 --> 30:02.948
- Do you?

30:02.949 --> 30:04.717
- I don't know.

30:04.718 --> 30:06.385
He was upset.

30:06.386 --> 30:07.920
- When you left Dr. Harris

30:07.921 --> 30:09.855
at the bar,
it was 1:00?

30:09.856 --> 30:11.056
- That's right.

30:11.057 --> 30:12.324
- And did you come home?

30:12.325 --> 30:15.527
- Actually I went
to a few more bars

30:15.528 --> 30:17.596
to celebrate
winning the grant.

30:19.766 --> 30:21.967
See?

30:23.803 --> 30:26.305
- Yes, I do see.

30:30.443 --> 30:33.178
Is that your sister?
It's a nice photo.

30:33.179 --> 30:36.015
- Orli.
My older sister.

30:36.016 --> 30:38.684
- Yeah, I--

30:38.685 --> 30:42.221
no, it's just I haven't seen
any other photos of her

30:42.222 --> 30:44.156
on the walls or...

30:44.157 --> 30:46.759
- No, um, my mother
took them down

30:46.760 --> 30:49.094
when orli moved out.

30:52.666 --> 30:56.635
- That bedroom,
a shrine to achievement.

30:56.636 --> 31:00.239
Maya grew up in a house
ere failure isn't an option.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.640
- She didn't fail.

31:01.641 --> 31:05.678
Langston awarded her
the grant.

31:05.679 --> 31:07.646
- Maybe she had reason
to believe

31:07.647 --> 31:10.315
that Langston might
change his mind.

31:10.316 --> 31:13.118
She couldn't let
her mother down.

31:14.888 --> 31:17.556
- Why should I talk to you
about my family?

31:17.557 --> 31:20.292
- Are you afraid your mother
wouldn't like it?

31:20.293 --> 31:22.861
She can't be too happy
about you working in a bar.

31:22.862 --> 31:26.498
- Unlike my sister,
the doctor?

31:26.499 --> 31:27.800
What's Maya done anyway?

31:27.801 --> 31:32.004
- She could be in trouble.

31:32.005 --> 31:34.006
You know, she kept a lot
of pictures of you

31:34.007 --> 31:35.574
on her iPhone.

31:35.575 --> 31:37.242
I think you mean a lot to her.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.378
- No way she's done
anything wrong.

31:39.379 --> 31:42.614
- It's very stressful
being perfect all the time.

31:42.615 --> 31:45.617
Sometimes people,
they crack.

31:45.618 --> 31:46.685
- Not Maya.

31:46.686 --> 31:49.621
She never flinched,
never cried.

31:49.622 --> 31:51.457
Not even the time my mother
threw out her dolls

31:51.458 --> 31:53.158
because she missed a note
in her cello recital.

31:53.159 --> 31:54.993
- You had a strict upbringing.

31:54.994 --> 31:58.263
- No tv, no sleepovers,

31:58.264 --> 32:00.532
no pets.

32:00.533 --> 32:02.568
Maya got a "b" in chemistry,

32:02.569 --> 32:05.270
so my mother
got rid of our dog.

32:05.271 --> 32:06.905
That's when
my father walked.

32:06.906 --> 32:08.006
- And you left too.

32:08.007 --> 32:09.842
It was just the two of them.

32:09.843 --> 32:11.643
No wonder Maya
felt responsible

32:11.644 --> 32:13.078
for your mother's
happiness.

32:13.079 --> 32:16.648
- She was living
my mother's life.

32:16.649 --> 32:18.016
Classic good girl.

32:18.017 --> 32:20.385
Maya didn't even want
to be a doctor.

32:20.386 --> 32:23.722
She wanted to be an artist.

32:23.723 --> 32:25.557
- She painted,
abstract florals.

32:25.558 --> 32:27.326
- Yeah, how did you--

32:27.327 --> 32:30.696
- I saw one of the paintings
in her bedroom.

32:30.697 --> 32:35.334
- Maya thought
our mother's attention

32:35.335 --> 32:37.269
was out of love.

32:37.270 --> 32:39.738
It damaged her.

32:39.739 --> 32:41.340
Why do you think
I had to leave?

32:44.944 --> 32:46.645
- Rerun the test at 80%.

32:46.646 --> 32:48.847
See if that increases
the protein level.

32:48.848 --> 32:50.315
- Okay.

32:50.316 --> 32:52.017
- I knew you'd be here.

32:52.018 --> 32:55.387
I mean, you're hardly
anywhere else.

32:55.388 --> 32:59.057
- More questions?
I'm kinda busy.

32:59.058 --> 33:03.695
- Medical research,
it's so enervating, isn't it?

33:03.696 --> 33:05.964
The hours,
the concentration.

33:05.965 --> 33:09.535
You never take time
to relax, do you?

33:09.536 --> 33:11.970
- I don't have the time.

33:11.971 --> 33:14.740
- You never have any fun.

33:14.741 --> 33:17.109
Certainly don't go
to four bars a night.

33:19.646 --> 33:24.583
Just the photos
on your phone.

33:24.584 --> 33:27.152
They were
a little phony.

33:27.153 --> 33:31.824
You know,
I think you overcompensated.

33:31.825 --> 33:35.661
You tried too hard.

33:35.662 --> 33:38.664
And the call to Sam
to meet you at the club,

33:38.665 --> 33:41.266
that was just
to alibi yourself, wasn't it?

33:41.267 --> 33:43.135
- No, that's not true.

33:43.136 --> 33:46.138
- Well, not entirely.

33:46.139 --> 33:50.175
But you did know that Langston
was Sam's father

33:50.176 --> 33:53.278
before Sam told you

33:53.279 --> 33:54.613
because you overheard
the confrontation

33:54.614 --> 33:55.981
between Langston
and his son.

33:55.982 --> 33:57.482
So did someone else.

33:57.483 --> 33:58.617
- Maya, stop talking.

33:58.618 --> 33:59.852
- Mom, what are
you doing here?

33:59.853 --> 34:01.286
- Your mother
was worried about you.

34:01.287 --> 34:02.721
- I'm here to take you home.

34:02.722 --> 34:04.690
- You always do everything
your mother says, don't you?

34:04.691 --> 34:06.391
- We're leaving.
- You always have, right?

34:06.392 --> 34:09.161
- Even becoming a doctor was
your mother's idea, wasn't it?

34:09.161 --> 34:10.195
- That is absurd.

34:10.196 --> 34:11.362
- We talked to your sister,

34:11.364 --> 34:12.965
found out how she left,

34:12.966 --> 34:14.699
how your father left,
how it was all your fault.

34:14.701 --> 34:16.534
- No, no.
- Don't listen to them.

34:16.536 --> 34:19.338
- Do you feel guilty
about that?

34:19.339 --> 34:21.940
Your mother was unhappy,

34:21.940 --> 34:24.275
so you wanted to do whatever
she told you to do.

34:24.277 --> 34:28.112
But you could never
work hard enough, right?

34:28.114 --> 34:31.583
Her standards
were unachievable.

34:31.583 --> 34:34.353
- Whatever my mom did for me
was for my own good.

34:34.353 --> 34:36.321
She wanted me
to reach my potential.

34:36.322 --> 34:38.891
- The good girl,
the perfect daughter,

34:38.891 --> 34:40.359
the one who
cleans up the mess.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.862
- But you're not a killer.

34:43.862 --> 34:45.429
You took a hippocratic oath.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.165
First do no harm.

34:47.166 --> 34:49.368
But your mother
didn't take that oath.

34:49.369 --> 34:51.969
- So when you killed Langston,
Maya took care of it.

34:51.971 --> 34:54.172
You switched the body
with a cadaver

34:54.172 --> 34:55.741
slated to be cremated.

34:55.742 --> 34:59.878
- You also overheard
that Sam was Langston's son.

34:59.879 --> 35:02.381
You know,
any rational person

35:02.382 --> 35:06.084
would think, well,
they announced the grant.

35:06.085 --> 35:08.520
Maya won.

35:08.521 --> 35:10.455
Did you know that Sam told us

35:10.456 --> 35:12.491
that during the confrontation

35:12.492 --> 35:14.660
his father told him

35:14.661 --> 35:17.729
that he would get
research money.

35:17.730 --> 35:20.565
See, you knew that.

35:20.566 --> 35:22.334
You panicked,

35:22.335 --> 35:24.736
because you believed
that from now on

35:24.737 --> 35:27.005
he would favor his own
flesh and blood,

35:27.006 --> 35:30.108
because that's
what you would do.

35:30.109 --> 35:31.276
- No, I killed him.

35:31.277 --> 35:33.312
I killed him!
I did it!

35:33.313 --> 35:36.048
- Are you gonna let
your daughter take the fall?

35:36.049 --> 35:38.383
Go to prison, death row,
for something you did?

35:38.384 --> 35:40.085
Not very maternal.

35:40.086 --> 35:42.754
- So you killed Ben Langston

35:42.755 --> 35:44.523
because you had to,

35:44.524 --> 35:46.191
because you couldn't
help yourself.

35:46.192 --> 35:48.794
You had no choice.

35:48.795 --> 35:51.730
- Mom.
Mom, no.

35:51.731 --> 35:52.764
- Stop it.

35:52.765 --> 35:55.434
- No.

35:55.435 --> 35:58.704
- We heard Langston
and Sam talking.

35:58.705 --> 36:00.839
I'd had a few drinks.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.908
I asked Langston to come
to Maya's lab,

36:02.909 --> 36:04.242
some excuse,

36:04.243 --> 36:06.178
she'd show him test results.

36:06.179 --> 36:11.950
Maya had no idea
what I was planning.

36:11.951 --> 36:13.485
There was a centrifuge
on the counter.

36:13.486 --> 36:15.120
It was heavy.

36:15.121 --> 36:17.622
Langston sat down
with his back to me.

36:17.623 --> 36:18.957
I picked it up,

36:18.958 --> 36:20.692
I smashed him over
the head with it.

36:20.693 --> 36:23.862
He fell over.

36:23.863 --> 36:25.263
Maya was horrified,

36:25.264 --> 36:27.766
but she said she could
get rid of the body.

36:27.767 --> 36:30.902
- Then you switched Langston's
body with a cadaver

36:30.903 --> 36:32.637
slated to be cremated.

36:32.638 --> 36:35.540
You dressed the cadaver up,
made it look like a prank.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.876
You put the cadaver
on a gurney,

36:37.877 --> 36:40.145
wheeled it to Langston's car,

36:40.146 --> 36:41.413
met Sam,

36:41.414 --> 36:44.016
alibi'd yourself
at the other bars,

36:44.017 --> 36:46.785
and then dumped the body
in the park

36:46.786 --> 36:49.921
and left Langston's car
by pier 92.

36:51.924 --> 36:53.425
- You can't prove
any of that.

36:53.426 --> 36:54.526
You can't.

36:54.527 --> 36:56.061
You can't prove
any of that.

36:56.062 --> 36:59.931
- No, you made a mistake.

36:59.932 --> 37:02.467
Dressing the cadaver
in Langston's clothes.

37:02.468 --> 37:06.138
I guess your mother wasn't
there to help you out.

37:06.139 --> 37:09.641
And you're not allowed
to make mistakes

37:09.642 --> 37:12.010
because your dog
would get taken away.

37:12.011 --> 37:16.982
You'd get taught a lesson.

37:16.983 --> 37:18.483
You know what I think?

37:24.724 --> 37:27.125
- I think your daughter
wanted to be caught.

37:30.229 --> 37:31.830
Because you're a doctor.

37:31.831 --> 37:36.568
And you save lives.

37:36.569 --> 37:38.103
You don't take them.

37:38.104 --> 37:41.373
- I'll sign
a full confession,

37:41.374 --> 37:43.075
but only if
my daughter goes free.

37:43.076 --> 37:44.342
- She covered up a murder,

37:44.343 --> 37:45.444
disposed of the body.

37:45.445 --> 37:47.079
- No, she did that
to protect me,

37:47.080 --> 37:48.246
because I told her to.

37:48.247 --> 37:50.348
- Mom! Mom!

37:50.349 --> 37:51.650
- Stop it.

37:51.651 --> 37:52.951
- No.

37:52.952 --> 37:55.554
- A full confession,

37:55.555 --> 37:57.155
and I won't
contest the sentence.

37:57.156 --> 37:58.490
- No, no.

37:58.491 --> 38:01.827
I love you, mommy.

38:01.828 --> 38:03.495
I love you.

38:03.496 --> 38:05.197
- Stop it!

38:05.198 --> 38:06.665
No, I know.

38:06.666 --> 38:09.701
Honey, I was hard on you.

38:09.702 --> 38:11.369
I was strict.

38:11.370 --> 38:13.905
But just look at you.

38:13.906 --> 38:15.974
Look how brilliant

38:15.975 --> 38:19.111
and accomplished you are.

38:23.182 --> 38:26.218
My daughter
is not going to prison,

38:26.219 --> 38:28.620
because she is going
to cure cancer.

38:45.338 --> 38:47.105
- It's a beautiful day today.

38:47.106 --> 38:48.907
- Yes, finally
we get a spring.

38:48.908 --> 38:50.408
- You don't suppose we could

38:50.409 --> 38:54.646
take this session outside,
do you?

38:54.647 --> 38:57.282
I guess you've heard
that one before.

38:57.283 --> 38:59.784
- We have more privacy
in here.

38:59.785 --> 39:03.522
Or is that why you wanna
be outside?

39:03.523 --> 39:05.190
- Do you always do that?

39:05.191 --> 39:09.060
You think that everything
is about something else?

39:09.061 --> 39:10.428
Or us?

39:10.429 --> 39:14.399
- I was thinking
about last session.

39:14.400 --> 39:17.202
I was challenging you
more than I had.

39:17.203 --> 39:22.040
- You asked me if I--
if I'm lonely.

39:22.041 --> 39:23.041
- Mm-hmm.

39:23.042 --> 39:25.610
- You asked if I could ever

39:25.611 --> 39:27.312
have feelings for some--

39:27.313 --> 39:28.747
- romantic feelings.

39:31.517 --> 39:35.487
- For someone I respect.

39:35.488 --> 39:37.622
But you didn't
answer my question.

39:37.623 --> 39:40.392
Is it too late?

39:40.393 --> 39:43.528
- Um, you're worried

39:43.529 --> 39:45.497
that you've missed
the boat?

39:45.498 --> 39:47.866
I think as we start--

39:47.867 --> 39:50.435
- can you stop?
Can you just--

39:50.436 --> 39:54.005
you know, we don't have
a lot of sessions left.

39:54.006 --> 39:55.574
You know, and I'm a big boy.

39:55.575 --> 39:58.677
You know, I'm a grown man.

39:58.678 --> 40:02.013
And what is it
that you said?

40:02.014 --> 40:03.582
My emotional drawbridge,
it's up.

40:03.583 --> 40:04.716
Okay, I can take it.

40:04.717 --> 40:06.151
Just tell me if you think

40:06.152 --> 40:08.220
I can have
what other people have.

40:08.221 --> 40:11.456
You know, a home,
a relationship.

40:11.457 --> 40:15.727
- If you wanna work
towards those goals,

40:15.728 --> 40:18.263
then, yeah,
we can do that.

40:18.264 --> 40:21.132
- "Work towards those goals."

40:21.133 --> 40:22.200
What is that?

40:22.201 --> 40:23.602
I mean,
what does that mean, no?

40:23.603 --> 40:26.471
I mean, is that
couched-in shrink speak?

40:26.472 --> 40:29.407
- I'm not the one
saying no or it's too late.

40:29.408 --> 40:31.276
You are.
Where's this coming from?

40:33.913 --> 40:37.048
- I mean, I look
in the mirror every day,

40:37.049 --> 40:39.084
and I see what you see.

40:42.521 --> 40:45.023
You know,
it's not working, this.

40:45.024 --> 40:48.460
You know, I ask you
for your professional judgment,

40:48.461 --> 40:50.161
and then you
turn it back on me.

40:50.162 --> 40:51.463
I mean, come on,
you're smart.

40:51.464 --> 40:54.699
You're someone
that I respect.

40:54.700 --> 40:57.135
- And you want to know

40:57.136 --> 40:59.504
if I see you as someone
capable of being

40:59.505 --> 41:00.805
in a relationship.

41:06.379 --> 41:09.581
- That's what--

41:09.582 --> 41:11.950
you think that I'm
hitting on you, is that--

41:11.951 --> 41:13.451
- no.
- Come on!

41:13.452 --> 41:14.986
- That's not what
I was saying.

41:14.987 --> 41:17.389
- No?

41:17.390 --> 41:19.157
Look, I know what you do,
doctor.

41:19.158 --> 41:22.027
You seem open,
empathic,

41:22.028 --> 41:23.762
and you listen.

41:23.763 --> 41:25.096
You know,
you're beautiful.

41:25.097 --> 41:29.000
So you get your patients
to trust you,

41:29.001 --> 41:30.835
and then you pull back.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.570
You toy with them,

41:32.571 --> 41:34.572
and that's your game,
isn't it?

41:34.573 --> 41:36.041
- Detective--
- isn't it? Isn't it?

41:36.042 --> 41:37.876
Look, this is not
working for me.

41:37.877 --> 41:40.045
- I know that
I have inadvertently--

41:40.046 --> 41:41.479
- you know, you should
call my captain,

41:41.480 --> 41:42.847
or, you know, ONE P.P.,

41:42.848 --> 41:45.817
or whoever
that you report back to,

41:45.818 --> 41:47.052
and you should tell them

41:47.053 --> 41:49.421
that I am not
a good candidate for therapy.

41:49.422 --> 41:52.223
- I need you to help me
understand what I did wrong.

41:52.224 --> 41:53.925
- If they want to take
my badge away again--

41:53.926 --> 41:55.794
- right when you feel
you need to run--

41:55.795 --> 41:57.495
- this isn't working.

41:57.496 --> 41:59.664
It's not helping.

42:00.305 --> 42:06.912
