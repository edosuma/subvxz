[Hank grunting]

[Electronic whirring]

00:41.228 --> 00:44.527
I'm getting a lot of interference
on the bedroom TV.

00:44.632 --> 00:48.124
HANK: What do you say you unplug your
"Peggy's," put down the classifieds...

00:48.235 --> 00:49.634
and come on to bed?

00:49.737 --> 00:53.400
As a former restaurant manager, I am
accustomed to setting my own hours.

00:53.507 --> 00:56.169
And unfortunately,
these are the hours I have set.

00:56.277 --> 00:58.211
I know you miss running that restaurant.

00:58.312 --> 01:01.247
PEGGY: It's not the restaurant I miss.
It's the people, Hank.

01:01.349 --> 01:02.907
Managing people.

01:03.017 --> 01:06.111
Telling them what to do
and then watching as they do it.

01:06.220 --> 01:09.155
Maybe you could ask the school
to let you substitute-teach...

01:09.256 --> 01:12.191
the first grade again.
Those kids usually do what you tell them.

01:12.293 --> 01:14.921
It's just not enough anymore. I am:

01:15.029 --> 01:19.898
"A natural-born leader who can
build business from zero to infinity.

01:20.001 --> 01:24.165
"Must be highly motivated self-starter
with own car."

01:24.271 --> 01:26.501
My God, Hank, that's me!

01:28.209 --> 01:31.235
Peggy, it's almost midnight.
You're gonna wake them up.

01:31.379 --> 01:33.939
No. I am gonna shake them up.

01:38.953 --> 01:41.114
LANEY: Who is it?
PEGGY: It is Peggy Hill.

01:42.223 --> 01:44.191
[Exclaims in surprise]

01:48.029 --> 01:51.465
LANEY: Well, that's the whole pitch
right there. Any questions?

01:51.565 --> 01:54.295
Yes. Metalife. What is that?

01:54.568 --> 01:56.035
Products for living.

01:56.570 --> 01:59.471
Okay, those are useful. And you sell them?

01:59.573 --> 02:03.134
Yes. And I have a number of people
who sell for me.

02:03.944 --> 02:07.744
So you would consider what you do
sales or management?

02:08.115 --> 02:10.639
A little bit of management, mostly sales.

02:10.751 --> 02:12.844
Yes! Management! Thank you.

02:17.324 --> 02:21.522
Laney, I hope you don't mind me asking,
but that pin, it is spectacular.

02:21.962 --> 02:24.954
Thank you.
So were my February sales figures.

02:25.066 --> 02:29.469
I hit $10,000, which got me
in the Metalife Double Diamond Club.

02:29.570 --> 02:33.301
Peggy, if you want to be your own boss,
come and work for me.

02:50.491 --> 02:51.719
But I was home, Bill.

02:51.826 --> 02:54.420
I know. I didn't want you to be bothered.

02:54.528 --> 02:56.723
- So, what are you doing?
- Put the package down.

02:56.831 --> 02:58.731
You wanna go for a walk?

02:58.833 --> 03:00.664
Go back to your house.

03:01.702 --> 03:02.896
[Door lock clicking]

03:03.003 --> 03:06.268
Okay, let's see.
These are the Metalife shakes...

03:06.373 --> 03:08.898
and here are the vitamins...

03:09.009 --> 03:13.070
and these are
Forty-Forty-Twenty MetaBars.

03:13.180 --> 03:15.341
That is, oh, percents.

03:15.616 --> 03:18.414
So you're gonna sell these, are you?

03:18.519 --> 03:21.613
Well, these things sell themselves.
$18, Bobby.

03:21.889 --> 03:25.689
Which will make it very easy for the team
of salespeople working beneath me.

03:25.793 --> 03:28.762
It sounds to me
like one of those pyramid schemes.

03:28.863 --> 03:30.091
No, not at all.

03:30.197 --> 03:32.859
As the brochure describes it,
it is not a pyramid.

03:32.967 --> 03:34.434
It is a triangle.

03:34.535 --> 03:38.062
And it is not a scheme, Hank.
It is an opportunity.

03:38.205 --> 03:39.900
Good question, though,

03:40.007 --> 03:43.170
This doesn't taste
like raspberry truffle at all.

03:43.277 --> 03:45.438
Then, honey, you're eating it wrong.
Put it down.

03:45.546 --> 03:47.514
All right, come on, let's get to it.

03:47.615 --> 03:50.049
Hank, you will sell at work.
You're assistant manager.

03:50.151 --> 03:51.778
They would have to buy from you.

03:51.886 --> 03:54.013
And, Luanne, you will sell at college.

03:54.121 --> 03:57.887
You must have made a whole bunch
of new friends that you can pressure.

04:03.130 --> 04:04.097
[Dale sniffs]

04:05.332 --> 04:09.428
Well, it's probably about time I apologize...

04:09.670 --> 04:13.037
for my misguided Y2K hysteria.

would go off without a hitch?

04:31.625 --> 04:35.083
No way. All I need is dang old
chopped beef in a blender and some eggs.

- Those are vitamins.

- Protein shake.

- What's that?
- That's also a protein shake.

What can I get for a quarter?

06:05.286 --> 06:08.653
So, before we start, any fun sales stories?

06:11.025 --> 06:12.583
Anything at all?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.588
Well, it's been a week, and at this time...

06:16.697 --> 06:19.222
I would like to please see
your order sheets.

Here you go, Peggy.

06:21.502 --> 06:22.491

06:22.603 --> 06:25.128
I can't sell at the office.
It's a propane place.

06:25.239 --> 06:26.934
I need to keep that pure.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.009
Luanne, I did not get your sheet.

06:29.109 --> 06:30.838
I didn't do one.

06:31.211 --> 06:33.372
But I did give away all my samples.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.040
What samples? Those weren't samples.

06:36.150 --> 06:39.677
My God, what am I running? You think
one sale between the three of us...

06:39.787 --> 06:42.051
is gonna keep this company going?

to let one of you go.

She's got a great future ahead of her.

06:51.465 --> 06:53.490
Fire me. Send her a message.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.569
I will fire you
if your sales figures don't improve.

Now put on your button,
go to the airport, and move some product.

and was carrying it up your path.

- I got to thinking...
- You ate my bars?

07:12.286 --> 07:14.584
No, I sold them. On the base.

Peggy, may I say what an honor it is...

07:39.446 --> 07:41.744
Have you heard of a quota system?

07:41.849 --> 07:44.044
I give you a certain number of sales...

07:44.151 --> 07:46.483
that you have to make
by the end of the month.

07:46.587 --> 07:49.147
So, we'll say this first month's quota is...

07:49.256 --> 07:51.690
I don't know, $10,000.

07:51.792 --> 07:54.283
What? No, that's a lot of sales, Peggy.

07:54.395 --> 07:57.626
- Well, I thought as much.
- I'll do it. I can do it.

of Sports Illustrated?

08:10.944 --> 08:14.880
I don't know, sir. But if I were you,
I wouldn't be worried about a magazine.

- What?

has not been evaluated by the FDA...

can re-grow hair.

There's chocolate, I think.

08:43.677 --> 08:46.043
$10,000 in his first month?

08:46.146 --> 08:48.478
That William Dauterive is quite a find!

08:48.582 --> 08:52.245
Well, thank you. I molded him,
motivated him. You know how it is.

08:52.686 --> 08:54.984
Is he excited
about the San Antonio conference?

08:55.089 --> 08:58.547
Are you kidding? Am I excited?
I cannot wait to go.

08:58.959 --> 09:01.484
It's just for the salesman himself, Peggy.

09:01.595 --> 09:04.530
Just the Double Diamond sellers,
and a guest.

09:04.965 --> 09:06.956
Your own numbers were quite small.

09:07.067 --> 09:11.766
Well, Laney, my sales are low because
of my management responsibilities.

09:12.139 --> 09:15.074
You know, meeting with my supplier...

09:15.175 --> 09:18.975
I am your supplier,
and meeting with me is 10 minutes.

09:19.079 --> 09:22.480
But it is a 15 minute drive,
and I was 20 minutes late.

09:25.018 --> 09:28.749

I would have put on pants.

09:29.389 --> 09:30.720
Can you give me a minute?

I have something important to tell you.

You have won a trip to the Metalife
State Sales Conference in San Antonio.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.068
Did I mention
that you get to bring a guest?

09:49.176 --> 09:52.634
And business etiquette dictates
that you invite me.

09:53.213 --> 09:57.912
In my wildest dreams,
I never thought you'd want to go with me.

09:58.018 --> 10:01.385
Of course I will take you, yes.
I'll even drive!

10:02.422 --> 10:05.516
I guess it doesn't make much sense
to take separate cars.

10:07.194 --> 10:08.752
San Antonio, huh?

10:08.862 --> 10:12.696
Well, when you get there safely,
call me collect with the name Antonio...

10:12.799 --> 10:14.630
and I won't accept the charges.

10:14.735 --> 10:17.863

then you'd use your own name.

that I have always given myself.

13:02.602 --> 13:04.934
Looks like someone's going to Nationals.

13:05.038 --> 13:06.198
What are the Nationals?

13:06.306 --> 13:09.867
It's how they reward the top performers.
Your manager's manager.

13:09.976 --> 13:12.137
And where are the Nationals held?

13:12.245 --> 13:14.236
- Right here.
- San Antonio?

13:14.348 --> 13:16.976
This room. And they fold back that wall.

13:17.084 --> 13:18.142
- No.
- Yes.

13:19.219 --> 13:22.347
Now, that Peggy Hill needs to see.
Excuse me.

13:23.857 --> 13:27.349
Bill, we are going to Nationals,
and here's how.

13:27.594 --> 13:31.155
Now, I am going to employ a pie chart.
You tell me if I lose you.

13:31.898 --> 13:35.265
PEGGY: Right now, you account
for 1000/0 of sales, okay?

13:35.369 --> 13:39.601
Now, what I need from you is more sales.

13:39.773 --> 13:42.901
Do you think
that you could sell 1000/0 more?

13:43.009 --> 13:45.204
If that's my new quota,
that's my new quota.

13:45.312 --> 13:48.247
Nationals! Let's go out
and celebrate tonight.

13:48.348 --> 13:51.181
Someplace fancy
where they'll lend you a jacket.

13:51.284 --> 13:53.980
I won't even have to worry about stains.

13:56.656 --> 13:59.420
Honey, put me down
for another 1,000 bars.

13:59.526 --> 14:01.391
I am going to Nationals.

14:01.495 --> 14:05.454
A thousand bars! You know,
you have to sell them to get to Nationals.

14:05.599 --> 14:08.261
Or buy them yourself. We really don't care.

14:08.702 --> 14:12.536
Then go ahead and put me down
for 2,000 of those bad boys.

14:12.672 --> 14:13.764
[Exclaims in delight]

14:13.940 --> 14:17.535
Marty, put me down
for another 2,000 bars.

14:17.878 --> 14:19.743
I'm going to Nationals!

14:20.614 --> 14:22.548
MARTY: Mike, another 2,000 bars!

14:23.049 --> 14:25.813
Bobby, when's this movie over?
I want to watch the news.

14:25.919 --> 14:29.548
The news?
You watched the news yesterday.

14:29.656 --> 14:31.317
Come on now, people.

14:31.425 --> 14:34.588
If you don't like the show,
there are other TVs.

14:47.140 --> 14:49.005
PEGGY: Bill, will you look at it?

14:49.876 --> 14:52.140
BILL: Men have walked on that moon.

14:52.245 --> 14:55.146
I guess sometimes
the impossible is possible.

14:55.282 --> 14:56.647
[Romantic instrumental music]

14:58.084 --> 15:01.076
Just like some would say
it's impossible to move 2,000 units.

15:01.188 --> 15:03.315
But I know you could do it.

15:03.423 --> 15:05.152
- I already sold half.
- No.

15:05.258 --> 15:08.193
I talked the hotel into
stocking all the mini-bars with them.

15:08.295 --> 15:09.626
You did not.

15:09.729 --> 15:12.664
Oh, my God!
We're going to Nationals. Yes!

15:13.567 --> 15:15.194
- Come here.
- All right.

15:15.302 --> 15:17.930
This is the Double Diamond pin
that you won.

15:18.038 --> 15:20.939
I think you deserve it even more than I do.

15:21.808 --> 15:25.175
No, I don't. Why would you say that?

15:25.278 --> 15:29.772
Because, Bill, you are a kind,
hardworking, superhuman people person...

15:29.883 --> 15:32.010
who's taking us to Nationals!

15:32.853 --> 15:34.946
Bill Dauterive, I love you.

15:35.288 --> 15:36.277
[Exclaims in shock]

15:36.389 --> 15:39.483
What are you doing?
Stop it! Leave me alone!

15:40.594 --> 15:44.792
Keep the jacket, keep the pin,
keep the moon. I quit!

15:46.233 --> 15:48.394
The room key's in the jacket.

15:48.768 --> 15:50.565
[Somber instrumental music]

15:53.707 --> 15:55.334
Laney!

15:58.712 --> 16:00.339
Cancel the order.

16:00.447 --> 16:01.880
What? I can't cancel...

16:01.982 --> 16:05.145
I said cancel the order.
My star salesman just quit on me.

16:05.252 --> 16:09.416
So? You can't return product.
That's just not how the system works.

16:09.723 --> 16:12.214
Come on. I think the triangle can handle it.

16:12.325 --> 16:15.590
It's not a triangle. It's a damn pyramid!

16:15.729 --> 16:19.028
You do whatever it takes
to get Dauterive back in the fold...

16:19.132 --> 16:23.330
or Marty VanHoldt is gonna come down
on us like the hair of the gods!

16:28.542 --> 16:29.634
[Doorbell rings]

16:29.743 --> 16:31.711
Hi, Bill. I brought your mail.

16:32.345 --> 16:34.939
PEGGY: Look, a postcard from Peggy Hill.

16:35.248 --> 16:38.684
"Having a great time in San Antonio.
Glad you're here."

16:39.052 --> 16:42.283
BILL: Just put it in my waste corner
on your way out.

16:44.257 --> 16:45.781
Somebody lost weight.

16:45.892 --> 16:48.019
Probably from all that hustling
you were doing.

16:48.128 --> 16:50.756
Yes, I'm a very attractive man.
I get it. Now go.

16:50.864 --> 16:53.424
Hold on, Bill. Do you like beer?

16:53.533 --> 16:56.468
Can those big feet of yours do a 180?

17:00.307 --> 17:02.070
This has been nice.

17:04.678 --> 17:06.669
See you at the sales meeting tomorrow?

17:06.780 --> 17:10.113
BILL: That sounds exciting,
but Tuesday's my ass-scratching day!

17:10.784 --> 17:14.049
Everything was going great,
but then when I tried to motivate him...

17:14.154 --> 17:17.123
that's a management term,
with a little praise, my term...

17:17.223 --> 17:19.817
he goes plumb loco. Spanish term.

17:19.925 --> 17:21.587
You must have confused him.

17:21.694 --> 17:24.163
Being dumped on is all Bill knows.

17:24.263 --> 17:26.993
First there was that childhood of his.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.929
Then he joined the Army...

17:29.035 --> 17:31.833
and then married
that backbreaker, Lenore.

17:33.974 --> 17:37.341
HANK: I'm gonna go oil the bearings
in your suitcase wheels.

17:37.444 --> 17:40.504
San Antonio dust contains a lot of silica.

17:41.014 --> 17:42.174
Your father's right.

17:42.282 --> 17:45.615
Bill has had a hard life,
and he likes it that way.

17:45.952 --> 17:48.284
He likes to be treated badly.

17:49.322 --> 17:52.189
It's called psychology, Aunt Peggy.

17:52.292 --> 17:54.624
The disease of psychology.

17:54.728 --> 17:56.662
I'm taking it pass-fail.

17:57.430 --> 18:00.024
Well, of course. He's crazy.

18:00.166 --> 18:04.466
If insulting him is the only way
to get Bill back to work selling...

18:04.571 --> 18:06.835
it is that nut job's lucky day.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.703
Okay, let's see.
I certainly can't attack his sales ability.

18:11.411 --> 18:13.902
Come on, there's plenty to work with.

18:14.014 --> 18:15.743
It's Bill Dauterive.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.481
He's bald, but he still has dandruff.

18:19.586 --> 18:21.281
I mean, what's that all about?

18:21.388 --> 18:24.084
- And don't forget his odor.
- He's afraid of thunder.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.851
Okay, good. But slow down.

18:26.593 --> 18:29.926
PEGGY: Hey, Baldy. If you're looking
for the hair on your head...

18:30.030 --> 18:33.056
why don't you check your shoulders
and your back?

18:33.166 --> 18:34.929
Get off my lawn.

18:35.035 --> 18:37.435
I don't fertilize with poo.

18:37.604 --> 18:41.233
Yeah? Well, I wouldn't waste
all that water on your lawn.

18:41.341 --> 18:44.708
You're gonna need it
to hose yourself down later...

18:44.811 --> 18:47.302
because you stink.

18:48.081 --> 18:49.343
You heard me.

18:49.449 --> 18:52.577
Even in France,
they would take notice of your bad odor.

18:53.253 --> 18:56.882
You were rude.
But in the morning, I'll be sober.

18:57.023 --> 18:59.423

to Nationals anyway...

Just give me one more chance, please?

19:15.408 --> 19:17.899
I'll sell all your bars. I know I can.

19:18.011 --> 19:21.538
One chance.
Tomorrow morning, my garage, 7:00.

19:21.648 --> 19:24.879
- It's a little early.
- You just bought yourself 6:45, mister.

of chromium biscuits into my car...

20:10.497 --> 20:12.556
I'll start pounding the pavement.

What are you doing?
I did not say you could take a break, did I?

20:16.903 --> 20:19.599
It's my toe. I think I have a blister.

20:19.706 --> 20:23.107
If you do, it's not from carrying boxes
for one day.

around for 40 years."

21:02.982 --> 21:04.882
Isn't that what you want?

21:04.984 --> 21:07.919
Not if it means
taking advantage of a friend.

No, not you. My friend? No.

Yes, Bill, I am your friend.

a good one...

to boost my own already healthy esteem.

And for that, I apologize.

No, Peggy, you don't have to apologize
to me. I'm not...

21:30.443 --> 21:34.573
The next words out of your mouth
better be "apology accepted."
