08:06.300 --> 08:08.500
-ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO
TALK TO THE BOUNCER.
-OKAY.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.300

08:10.400 --> 08:11.800
-HE'S GOT BLOOD.
-WHERE'S HIS KNIFE?

08:11.900 --> 08:13.967
UH, NO. TALK TO THAT GUY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

08:14.067 --> 08:17.533
-HE DROPPED IT
SOMEWHERE OVER HERE?

08:17.633 --> 08:19.767
-SOMEONE SAID A GUY
ON A BIKE PICKED IT UP.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.433
CAN I SPEAK TO SOMEONE--
-WHO PICKED IT UP?

08:21.533 --> 08:23.067
-SOME-- SOMEONE ON A BIKE.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.767
-SOMEBODY ON A BIKE
PICKED UP THE KNIFE?

08:24.867 --> 08:26.633
-SOMEBODY JUMPED ON MY BACK.
-HEY. HEY.

08:26.733 --> 08:28.533
-AND I DID NOT KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.633
-HEY, WE'LL HAVE
A CHANCE TO TALK--
-SOMEBODY JUMPED ON MY BACK,

08:30.733 --> 08:32.900
AND I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
-LET'S GET UP TO YOUR FEET.

08:33.067 --> 08:36.067
-SOMEBODY JUMPED ON MY BACK
AND GRABBED ME BY THE NECK.
-HEY, STAND UP.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.367
ON YOUR FEET.

08:38.367 --> 08:40.133
WALK OVER TO THAT CAR.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.300
-SOMEBODY TRIED TO CHOKE ME OUT,

08:43.400 --> 08:46.567
AND I DID NOT KNOW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.767
-YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE
ON YOU, BUD?
-NO. (coughs)

08:48.867 --> 08:50.867
-HEY. YOU NEED TO

08:50.967 --> 08:52.300
AND WE'LL COME CHAT

08:52.400 --> 08:54.067
OR YOU'RE GONNA GO IN
HANDCUFFS AND GO TO DETOX.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.900
SO STAND OVER THERE
ON THE SIDEWALK.

08:56.067 --> 08:57.967
-RIGHT, BUT-- I MEAN--
-STAND ON THE SIDEWALK.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.467
AND WE WILL COME CHAT WITH YOU
IN JUST A MINUTE.

09:01.567 --> 09:04.367
-WHAT HAPPENED?
-I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

09:04.467 --> 09:06.600
SO MY FIRST REACTION
WAS TO GRAB MY WEAPON.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.267
-COULD IT HAVE BEEN
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

09:08.367 --> 09:10.500
-NO. IT WAS DEFINITELY
NOT A FRIEND OF MINE.
-HOW DO YOU KNOW? OKAY.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.967
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?
-DANIEL.

09:12.067 --> 09:13.767
-OKAY, DANIEL, HANG TIGHT OKAY?
-OKAY.

09:13.867 --> 09:16.667
-ALL RIGHT, THAT'S THE SECURITY
GUY THAT WAS HOLDING HIM DOWN.

09:16.767 --> 09:19.467
CAN YOU JUST RUN IT THROUGH
WHAT HAPPENED.

09:19.567 --> 09:21.067
-UM...

09:21.133 --> 09:23.067
THE MAN EXITED THE BAR. UM...

09:23.133 --> 09:24.667
-THAT GUY THAT WE HAVE
IN OUR COP CAR...
-YEAH.

09:24.767 --> 09:26.833
-THAT YOU WERE
HOLDING DOWN? OKAY.
-HE CAME OUT ALREADY AGGRESSIVE

09:26.933 --> 09:28.533
WITH THE KNIFE. HE WAS
FLAILING THE KNIFE AROUND.

09:28.633 --> 09:30.100
-DID HE GET KICKED OUT, OR...?

09:30.200 --> 09:31.867
-UH, YEAH. HE WAS
BEING KICKED OUT.

09:31.967 --> 09:34.433
HE WASN'T LIKING IT, AND HIS--

09:34.533 --> 09:37.833
HE WAS-- AS HE WAS
COMING ACROSS,
I WAS AT AN ANGLE

09:37.933 --> 09:39.900
TO WHERE HIS BACK
WAS TOWARDS ME,

09:40.067 --> 09:43.267
AND I SAW THE OPPORTUNITY TO
KNOCK THE KNIFE OUT OF HIS HAND.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.233
AND I RAN UP BEHIND HIM.

09:45.333 --> 09:48.067
I BROKE HIS ARMS DOWN.
THE KNIFE FELL TO THE FLOOR,

09:48.167 --> 09:49.767
AND I RESTRAINED HIM

09:49.867 --> 09:54.867
AND HAD SOMEBODY, ONE OF THE
OTHER PEOPLE, CALL THE, UM...
THE P.D.

09:54.967 --> 09:58.333
UH, GIRLFRIEND WAS GOING CRAZY
TRYING TO HIT ME
IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

09:58.433 --> 10:00.300
-AND WHEN THE KNIFE FELL,
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT WENT?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.567
-UM, SOMEBODY SAID
THAT A MAN ON A BIKE

10:02.667 --> 10:04.433
DROVE BY, PICKED UP THE KNIFE.

10:04.533 --> 10:07.133
I SAID YOU GUYS MIGHT WANNA--
-LIKE THE STREET-KID TYPE?

10:07.233 --> 10:09.133
-PROBABLY. IT WAS
KINDA HECTIC, SO--

10:09.233 --> 10:10.800
-OKAY. YOU GONNA BE HERE
FOR A MINUTE?

10:10.900 --> 10:12.033
-I WILL BE HERE FOR A MINUTE.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.500
-OKAY. JUST HANG OUT HERE, AND

10:13.600 --> 10:15.000
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IF
WE NEED ANY MORE, OKAY?

10:15.100 --> 10:16.967
-OKAY.
-ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

10:17.067 --> 10:20.833
YOUNG LADY, COULD YOU
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW?

10:20.933 --> 10:22.733
-WHAT I SAW?
-YEAH. WHAT HAPPENED OVER HERE?

10:22.833 --> 10:25.433
-I SAW MY
BEST FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND

10:25.533 --> 10:28.200
GET JUMPED ON THE STAIRS.

10:28.300 --> 10:29.767
-OKAY. AND HOW'D THAT GO AROUND?

10:29.867 --> 10:32.700
-FOR BREAKING A GLASS
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ON PURPOSE...

10:32.800 --> 10:35.933
-OKAY.
-THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
ACCIDENTAL ALSO.

10:36.033 --> 10:37.300
THANK YOU.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.067
-SO DID YOU GUYS
GET ASKED TO LEAVE?

10:39.167 --> 10:40.467
-YES.
-YEAH?

10:40.567 --> 10:44.100
-I MEAN, IT WAS MORE OF
LIKE A FORCEFUL, LIKE...

10:44.200 --> 10:47.667
YOUR FRIEND IS GETTING
DRAGGED OUT BY HIS
(bleep) TEETH.

10:47.767 --> 10:49.467
I HEARD A KNIFE WAS THROWN.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.300
-OKAY.
-I DIDN'T SEE IT HAPPEN.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.967
-UH-HUH.
-UM...

10:53.067 --> 10:55.800
-WE'RE JUST THROWN OUT.
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT, YOU KNOW?
-SHH.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.167
-IS HE FRIEND, BOYFRIEND?

10:58.267 --> 10:59.867
-HE IS MY
BEST FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.833
-OH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
-Girl: YEAH.

11:01.933 --> 11:04.867
MY BOYFRIEND IS THE MOST
PERFECT HUMAN BEING
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.933
-YEAH, I TALKED TO HIM.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
REAL GOOD CARE OF HIM.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.067
HE'S GONNA JUST HAVE ONE
SMALL MISDEMEANOR CHARGE

11:09.100 --> 11:10.300
FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.600
-SHE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THAT.
-OKAY?

11:11.700 --> 11:13.633
BECAUSE HE HAD THE KNIFE--
-BECAUSE HONESTLY,

11:13.733 --> 11:16.667
THEY HAD HIM-- THEY HAD HIM
IN A CHOKEHOLD,

11:16.767 --> 11:18.467
AND HE WAS NOT RESISTING.
-HERE. HERE.

11:18.567 --> 11:19.633
-(bleep)

11:19.733 --> 11:21.667
-SO, IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT HE IS GUILTY.

11:21.767 --> 11:23.267
IT JUST MEANS THAT
WE HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE

11:23.367 --> 11:24.867
TO ARREST HIM FOR THAT.

11:24.967 --> 11:27.067
WE'LL TAKE REAL
GOOD CARE OF HIM.
-HE'S NOT RESISTING RIGHT NOW.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.067
-HE'S NOT RESISTING OR ANYTHING.
HE'S FINE. HE'S TALKING TO ME

11:29.167 --> 11:30.567
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE TALKING TO ME.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.500
OKAY? SO WATCH YOUR FEET, OKAY?
I'M GONNA CLOSE THE DOOR.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.067
-I WANT MY BOYFRIEND.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.367
-ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS,
DON'T FORGET TO WEAR
YOUR SEATBELTS, OKAY?

11:36.467 --> 11:38.500
-OF COURSE.

THANK YOU, SIR.

11:41.700 --> 11:45.067

11:48.067 --> 11:49.933
-OKAY.
-SO THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

11:50.067 --> 11:52.767
CAN YOU RUN IT
THROUGH ME A LITTLE BIT,
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BAR?

11:52.867 --> 11:54.200
WHY'D YOU GET ASKED TO LEAVE?

11:54.300 --> 11:55.867
-I WAS INFORMED THAT
MY GIRLFRIEND

11:55.967 --> 11:58.667
HAD BEEN ESCORTED
OFF THE PROPERTY.

11:58.767 --> 12:02.333
-OKAY.
-UH, I ALSO HAD LEFT
THE PROPERTY

12:02.433 --> 12:04.300
TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.
-OKAY.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.700
-I KNOCKED A SHOT GLASS
OFF A TABLE.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.500
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
-OKAY.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.600
-UH, ON MY WAY UPSTAIRS,

12:10.700 --> 12:13.067
UH, UPON LEAVING THE FACILITY...

12:13.100 --> 12:14.433
-MM-HMM.
-I WAS...

12:14.533 --> 12:17.300
SOMEBODY JUMPED ONTO MY BACK.
-OKAY.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.900
-UM, I GRABBED MY KNIFE BECAUSE
SOMEBODY WAS STILL CHOKING ME.

12:21.067 --> 12:24.333
-OKAY.
-I COULDN'T BREATH AND
I WAS STARTING TO PASS OUT.

12:24.433 --> 12:26.767
I HAD-- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

12:26.867 --> 12:29.067
IT WAS SELF DEFENSE,
100 PERCENT.
-OKAY.

12:29.133 --> 12:31.233
-UH, AS SOON AS I LEFT HERE,

12:31.333 --> 12:33.933
I-- MY FACE WAS
SHOVED INTO THE CEMENT,

12:34.067 --> 12:38.133
AND AT THAT POINT
THEY TOLD ME NOT TO MOVE.

12:38.233 --> 12:40.233
-OKAY.
-BECAUSE THE POLICE WERE COMING.

12:40.333 --> 12:43.500
-OKAY. YOU'VE GOT
THE DISORDERLY CONDUCT CHARGE.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.333
OKAY? AND THE MENACING CHARGE.

12:45.433 --> 12:47.600
-EVEN THOUGH IT WAS
SELF DEFENSE.

12:47.700 --> 12:51.067
-THIS RIGHT HERE ONLY MEANS
THAT WE HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE

12:51.167 --> 12:53.067
TO ARREST YOU FOR IT.
-OF COURSE.

12:53.133 --> 12:54.900
AND I AGREE WITH YOU.
-OKAY.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.533
AND SO--
-ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS

12:56.633 --> 12:58.133
MAKE SURE THAT
MY GIRLFRIEND WAS SAFE.

12:58.233 --> 13:00.467
-OKAY, AND YOU TOLD
THE OTHER OFFICERS THAT
WHEN THEY TALKED TO YOU?

13:00.567 --> 13:01.867
-I DID, YES.
-OKAY.

13:01.967 --> 13:04.367
WELL, LIKE I SAID, I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION,

13:04.467 --> 13:06.200
AND IT GOES A LONG WAYS.
WE LET THE DEPUTIES KNOW

13:06.300 --> 13:08.367
THAT YOU WERE COMPLETELY
COMPLIANT AND EVERYTHING
LIKE THAT.

13:08.467 --> 13:11.267
-THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU
IN A BIT. YEP.

13:13.067 --> 13:14.767
OKAY, SO THAT GUY
THAT YOU HAD HELD DOWN,

13:14.867 --> 13:16.667
THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE HIM
WITH DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

13:16.767 --> 13:18.667
THEY WERE GONNA CHARGE HIM
WITH MENACING, BUT

13:18.767 --> 13:22.467
THEY DECIDED SINCE HE WASN'T
REALLY TRYING TO POINT IT
IN ANYBODY'S DIRECTION.

13:22.567 --> 13:25.500
SO ALL I CAN SAY IS, GOOD JOB.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.433
THANKS. YEP.
-ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.
TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.800
-I MOVED HERE TEN YEARS AGO
FROM NEW YORK.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.900
UM, BEEN ON THE DEPARTMENT
FOR TEN YEARS.

13:34.067 --> 13:36.400
I RECENTLY BECAME
A FIELD TRAINING OFFICER.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.600
AND TEACHING THE NEW GUYS
HOW TO DO THIS JOB,

13:38.700 --> 13:40.467
IT'S FUN TO WATCH THEM
GROW AS AN OFFICER,

13:40.567 --> 13:42.433
AND IT'S A GRATIFYING
EXPERIENCE FOR ME.

13:42.533 --> 13:43.767
AND I LEARN THINGS
FROM THEM, TOO,

13:43.867 --> 13:45.667
'CAUSE THEY COME OUT
WITH NEW INFORMATION, AND

13:45.767 --> 13:47.667
YOU KNOW, WE'RE BASICALLY
TEACHING EACH OTHER.

13:47.767 --> 13:50.367
WE'RE GOING TO A CALL NOW.

APPARENTLY STOLE SOME STUFF

13:53.367 --> 13:56.367
AND, UH, THE COMPLAINANT'S
GOING PRETTY HYSTERICAL NOW,
SO.

13:56.467 --> 13:59.433
-(radio chatter)
-I'M GONNA HEAD OVER THERE,
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:59.533 --> 14:02.467
BAKER ONE TEN 23.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.300

14:08.167 --> 14:09.533
-HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?

14:09.633 --> 14:11.167
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?
-YES, I DID.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.500
-WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:12.600 --> 14:14.500
-MY ROOMMATE IS STEALING.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.333
-HE'S STEALING?
-YEAH. FROM ME.

14:16.433 --> 14:17.600
-FROM YOU? WHAT DID HE STEAL?

14:17.700 --> 14:19.700
-FOOD AND (bleep).
-OKAY. WHERE'S HE AT?

14:19.800 --> 14:22.533
-HE'S IN HIS ROOM. I TOLD HIM

14:22.633 --> 14:25.533
-OKAY.

A CONFRONTATION.

14:25.633 --> 14:29.333
-OKAY.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.233
-OKAY.
-TELL HIM TO

14:31.333 --> 14:32.767
AND I'LL LEAVE
HIS (bleep) ALONE.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.800
-OKAY, WHEN YOU SAY,
"CONFRONTATION,"
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:34.900 --> 14:36.067
WHAT KIND OF CONFRONTATION?

14:36.133 --> 14:39.200
-WE GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.500
I'M GONNA TELL YOU LIKE IT IS.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.300
I'M TIRED OF HIS BULL (bleep).

14:43.400 --> 14:46.267
-HE THINK HE'S BIG AND BAD.
-OKAY, HE'S INSIDE NOW?

14:46.367 --> 14:47.700
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.500
-(indistinct)

14:50.600 --> 14:52.500
-DOES HE HAVE ANY WEAPONS
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
IN THE HOUSE

14:52.600 --> 14:54.100
THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT?
-NO.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.733
-OKAY.
-I PUT MY--

14:55.833 --> 14:58.667
I PUT MY MACE AND MY KNIFE UP

14:58.767 --> 15:00.300
ON MY DRESSER.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.200
I'M GONNA BE HONEST.
-OKAY.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.967
-WHERE DO WE GO?
-OKAY.

15:04.067 --> 15:05.333
-GO IN THERE, OF COURSE.

15:05.433 --> 15:07.567
-HELLO.
-HOW YOU DOING, SIR?

15:07.667 --> 15:09.767
SO WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY, SIR?
WHAT BRINGS US HERE?

15:09.867 --> 15:12.267
-I OPENED UP--
I GOT A KNOCK ON MY DOOR.

15:12.367 --> 15:15.067
-UH-HUH.
-I WAS LAYING DOWN,

15:15.167 --> 15:16.967
A KNOCK ON MY DOOR,
AND IT'S LITTLE BILLY.

15:17.067 --> 15:18.733
HE ASKED ME
DID I DRINK HIS MILK.

15:18.833 --> 15:20.300
-IS THAT LITTLE BILLY OUTSIDE?

15:20.400 --> 15:22.533
SO HE WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU DRANK HIS MILK?
-I SAID, "YES."

15:22.633 --> 15:24.967
WE ALWAYS SHARED
EACH OTHER'S STUFF.

15:25.067 --> 15:26.733
-OKAY.
-FOOD, MILK, ANYTHING.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.067
-OKAY.

15:28.167 --> 15:29.833
-AND, UH, I SAID, "YEAH,"

15:29.933 --> 15:31.233
AND HE STARTED YELLING AT ME.

15:31.333 --> 15:34.067
I KNEW HE HAD SOME KIND OF
ATTITUDE LAST NIGHT, BECAUSE...

15:35.867 --> 15:37.500
HE-- WE SMOKED OUT ON THE PORCH,

15:37.600 --> 15:39.633
AND HE WAS SPITTING
ALL OVER THE PORCH.

15:39.733 --> 15:41.233
-OKAY.
-SO...

15:41.333 --> 15:43.500
I SAID, "YEAH, I DRANK
A LITTLE BIT FOR MY COFFEE."

15:43.600 --> 15:45.833
BEFORE I COULD
GET "COFFEE" OUT...

15:45.933 --> 15:47.633
HE COLD-COCKED ME
RIGHT HERE, MAN.

15:47.733 --> 15:48.667
-HE HIT YOU?
