PARIS: Porte de Clignancourt
September 2nd 1979

01:17.649 --> 01:19.301
Go away!

01:19.596 --> 01:22.776
- Sir, Inspector, only one question...
- There's nothing that will help him.

01:22.802 --> 01:25.062
- How many of you were there?
- Maybe 30, not more.

01:25.192 --> 01:29.763
- How long have you been following them for?
- You know all details...

01:30.944 --> 01:33.230
- I'll inform you about everything.
- Couldn't you make the mistake?

01:33.317 --> 01:34.586
No, I absolutly disagree.

01:34.673 --> 01:38.844
- Did the operation go without any complications?
- Yes. Two teams worked on it,

01:38.896 --> 01:41.347
detectives and guys from command center.

01:41.738 --> 01:43.563
One last question...

01:51.149 --> 01:54.947
Open the doors. We've seen him to carry the weapons.
He had two grenades.

01:55.460 --> 02:00.221
We fired a warning shots...
He didn't want to give it up. We had no other choice.

02:01.091 --> 02:03.750
We would lose him if he managed
to get to the circle.

02:05.488 --> 02:08.347
Jojo! Bring the stretchers!

02:31.427 --> 02:33.244
We already seen everything important. Let's go.

02:34.409 --> 02:35.721
Hold on.

03:06.875 --> 03:13.201
Year 1973...

03:14.687 --> 03:16.859
...thursday...

03:17.311 --> 03:19.562
...eight...

03:20.830 --> 03:22.925
...of march.

03:34.657 --> 03:35.977
Testimony...

03:37.880 --> 03:42.069
... of Mesrine, Jacques.

03:42.191 --> 03:45.701
Hey, you clown.
What do you think would break first, handcuffs or radiator?

03:46.545 --> 03:49.716
My last name is Merine not Mesrine!

03:50.143 --> 03:53.418
Like the name  "Miromesnil", it is with "s"
but you don't pronounce it.

03:53.549 --> 03:57.051
That's enough Mesrine!
Let's talk about your friend,

03:57.156 --> 04:00.588
- Grangier Ardouin.
- I don't know him.

04:02.412 --> 04:04.273
Seriously, I don't know him.

04:04.342 --> 04:10.755
- Mister Jacques. Welcome.
- Hey, what's going on?

04:11.581 --> 04:15.361
- Looks like you gained a few.
- Are you crazy? I'm on diet for last three months.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.853
- Really? Let me see.
- You see?

04:21.357 --> 04:24.520
- Armed to the teeth.
- Yeah, like it's supposed to be.

04:27.903 --> 04:28.987
Clear.

04:37.390 --> 04:40.806
- Wait! Where are you going?
- Come on, one more right here.

04:42.257 --> 04:43.856
On the floor! All of you on the floor!

04:45.524 --> 04:47.088
On the floor!

04:48.045 --> 04:50.156
Nobody moves! Lie down!

04:50.660 --> 04:53.450
I said don't move!

04:55.631 --> 04:58.160
Put all money in the bag! Hurry up!
Everybody stays down!

04:58.421 --> 05:00.541
Hurry! Hurry!   Let's go!

05:01.957 --> 05:05.763
- Good girl.
- We're outta here! We're outta here!

05:07.180 --> 05:10.309
The bank teller...  ok she recognized me...
sure, because i didn't have a mask on... so?

05:10.482 --> 05:14.757
- She identified your accomplice too.
- I don't give a shit.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.928
First, i don't know any of them and secondly,
my buddies always wear masks.

05:19.371 --> 05:20.832
Maybe she eats too many carrots.

05:21.050 --> 05:22.648
We caught you too easy.

05:29.119 --> 05:36.100
Freeze! Don't move!
Hold him!

05:37.291 --> 05:41.288
- You're confessing to the robbery and the murder attempt.
- Yes,  I am.

05:42.010 --> 05:46.511
- But you are not confessing to the kidnapping.
- Why should I admit something

05:46.598 --> 05:47.606
that I haven't done.

05:47.892 --> 05:50.152
It's completly logical I won't admit
something I haven't done.

05:50.856 --> 05:52.671
We'll take you to the court in Compiegne.

05:54.845 --> 05:57.626
You'll be locked up...  for a very long time.

05:58.234 --> 06:00.424
In three months I won't be there.
You wanna bet?

06:19.855 --> 06:21.653
- What again?
- I have to go to bathroom.

06:21.734 --> 06:24.860
- Hold it.
- I am sick! Am i supposed to shit my pants in front of judge?

06:25.730 --> 06:28.519
- Mesrine, move.
- Sure.

06:33.307 --> 06:35.438
Am i going to wipe my ass with my foot or what?

06:38.625 --> 06:39.824
Hold on.

06:44.187 --> 06:45.308
Now you can.

06:48.914 --> 06:53.399
And what about you? What do you want? Are you gay or you want to smell
my shit?  Let me shit!

06:55.883 --> 06:58.943
Am I supposed to shit right here?
Loosen up the cuffs. I won't run.

07:03.389 --> 07:07.633
Ahh, what a relief.

07:30.618 --> 07:31.730
Hurry!

07:32.796 --> 07:34.277
Now i feel better.

07:41.915 --> 07:44.775
Mister Mesrine, stand here...

07:44.785 --> 07:47.450
Your honor,  by the law i shouldn't
have the handcuffs on me.

07:47.590 --> 07:49.137
It's the violation of my rights.

07:49.415 --> 07:53.569
It's sounds very funny when
you talk about the law.

07:53.759 --> 07:56.697
- For your defense you won't need to use your hands.
- Your honor...!

07:56.731 --> 07:58.418
Enough! That's enough Mesrine!

08:01.320 --> 08:03.640
Everyone on the ground! Let's go!

08:03.858 --> 08:09.254
Unlock my handcuffs! Hurry!
Fat ass next to the wall, let's go!

08:11.435 --> 08:13.025
Nobody moves!

08:13.468 --> 08:15.042
Get out of there!

08:18.083 --> 08:20.543
Stay on the floor!
You get up! Move!

08:21.107 --> 08:22.211
On the floor!

08:23.714 --> 08:27.321
Hands up! On the floor!

08:29.345 --> 08:32.014
Everybody with your face to the floor!

08:32.785 --> 08:34.099
Let's go!

08:34.455 --> 08:35.558
Quickly after him!

08:35.602 --> 08:37.749
This won't help your case, Mesrine.

08:38.835 --> 08:41.190
- Don't shoot!
- Stay over there!

08:42.099 --> 08:43.902
Put the gun down! Move!

08:44.153 --> 08:46.613
- Hurry or i kill him!
- Easy, take it easy.

08:46.937 --> 08:48.490
All of you back off!

08:50.994 --> 08:53.287
- get out of here!
- move, go after him!

08:56.250 --> 08:57.563
Go! Go!

09:01.255 --> 09:02.881
- Why did you let the judge go?
- Move!

09:04.905 --> 09:06.739
Go faster!

09:08.033 --> 09:10.076
- Jacques!
- Watch out!

09:15.437 --> 09:19.983
Hand me the gun.
Back up or i'll shoot!

09:20.852 --> 09:22.103
I said BACK UP!

09:23.146 --> 09:24.710
I'll kill you, you moron!

09:31.175 --> 09:32.948
Good bye, good luck!

09:58.914 --> 10:01.000
Robert caught a bullet.
Can you take it out?

10:02.251 --> 10:04.128
I don't know, I have to take a look.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.422
Here.

10:07.152 --> 10:09.655
- Jacques, I have a news from your family.
- What news?

10:09.759 --> 10:12.679
Your father is sick...
Come, I'll take a look.

10:13.618 --> 10:14.765
Shit!

10:17.268 --> 10:20.917
Jacques Mesrine may have not commited
his most serious crime ever, yesterday,

10:21.022 --> 10:23.107
but definitely his boldest.

10:23.295 --> 10:25.401
At first, he chose the place of his escape.

10:26.027 --> 10:29.677
After being arrested in march of this year,
Mesrine said he doesn't agree with the sentence.

10:29.781 --> 10:32.180
He knew that his appeal hearing will be held in Compiegne court.

10:33.222 --> 10:37.060
When they arrived he asked the guards a permission
to go to the bathroom.

10:37.185 --> 10:40.731
He knew his accomplices hid the gun
in a toilet

10:40.965 --> 10:45.797
without being noticed by the guards.
They didn't even realized and Jacques Mesrine was armed.

10:45.971 --> 10:51.011
He yelled: "I kill the judge..."
- That's lie! I've never said that.

10:51.185 --> 10:53.618
...all french cops now know

10:53.823 --> 11:00.396
that Jacques Mesrine must be considered as "The Public Enemy
Number 1"

11:02.108 --> 11:06.627
Number 1. Number 1!

11:11.676 --> 11:12.797
Hello.

11:27.877 --> 11:38.962
Dad. Dad it's me. Can you see?
It's me Jacques.

11:40.319 --> 11:45.562
- Jacques.
- How do you feel? - You came...

11:47.306 --> 11:50.338
I thought i'll  pay you a little visit
since all banks are closed.

11:51.612 --> 11:53.258
Fool.

11:59.757 --> 12:07.889
- You came... Have you seen your daughter yet?
- No, not yet.

12:11.739 --> 12:15.991
I wasn't the best son,
but my father was proud of me.

12:18.486 --> 12:20.600
That's the way i was born. Forgive me.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.022
That's the way i am.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.714
- It's my fault.
- No, no.

12:32.642 --> 12:37.994
What ever happens you always
will be her father.

12:43.383 --> 12:44.807
I know.

12:47.406 --> 12:49.778
Like you always will be my son.

12:54.297 --> 12:55.418
Yes.

13:03.781 --> 13:09.052
Forgive me, please forgive me.

13:15.877 --> 13:21.923
- I think you should go.
- Yes, i will.

13:48.725 --> 13:52.164
Except children, mother and friends
no one else is here.

13:52.636 --> 13:54.667
He is not such an idiot to come here.

13:54.703 --> 13:57.587
Paris, september, 1973

14:05.191 --> 14:09.579
- What"s that? Remembrance from the fight?
- No, it's from boxing.

14:09.884 --> 14:11.665
Oh, so you're a boxer.

14:15.932 --> 14:17.504
Michel is a boxer too.

14:24.274 --> 14:26.994
- Do you know how to drive?
- Yeah.

14:28.174 --> 14:31.165
We're planning a small job.
Are you interested?

14:58.176 --> 15:02.345
Stolen car have been reported.
It is a silver Renault 16,

15:02.545 --> 15:07.663
license plate number is 7791YL75.
- We spotted the reported vehicle.

15:15.954 --> 15:18.404
Unit... we got the car.

15:20.284 --> 15:21.794
Shit!

15:27.375 --> 15:30.397
The street is not an ashtray, sir.
We'll have to give you a fine.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.472
Get out of the car and show us
your papers, please.

15:37.698 --> 15:39.678
I'm waiting. Get out of the car!

15:40.827 --> 15:43.119
Don't resist! Put the hands behind your back!
Quickly!

15:48.960 --> 15:50.107
Shit.

16:10.119 --> 16:11.588
Move out of my way.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.262
Stop! Stop!

16:19.817 --> 16:22.527
Get out of the car!
Open the door! Hurry!

16:33.061 --> 16:34.217
Get out!

16:39.537 --> 16:40.682
Don't move!

16:44.115 --> 16:45.166
Go already!

16:46.096 --> 16:47.252
Fast!

17:03.511 --> 17:04.771
Step on it!

17:21.030 --> 17:22.384
Faster! Faster!

17:48.362 --> 17:49.403
Go!

17:55.903 --> 17:56.877
Let's leave!

18:06.870 --> 18:07.991
Out of way!

18:12.449 --> 18:13.865
Come on, train is here!

18:14.907 --> 18:16.959
Move! Quick! Jump in!

18:21.112 --> 18:23.737
Nobody moves!
Shut up! Sit down!

18:37.677 --> 18:38.783
Shit!

18:39.353 --> 18:41.135
Who are you starring at? Stare at floor!

18:46.765 --> 18:51.416
I knew he'd fuck it up. He's an asshole!
They almost got us because of him!

18:51.833 --> 18:55.065
You're always the smartest one and i'm an idiot.
And now leave me alone!

18:55.587 --> 19:00.530
Alone? What are you talking about?! Cops got him!
Now that moron is blabbing to them!

19:05.744 --> 19:09.769
Listen to me! I only choose those
who knows how to keep their mouth shut.

19:10.290 --> 19:11.438
Go fuck yourself!

19:15.747 --> 19:16.685
Always!

19:21.136 --> 19:23.326
If you're so sure about it
then you'll have to do it without me.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.454
I'm done Mesrin!

19:26.600 --> 19:28.154
- Then just leave!
- I'm gone!

19:30.720 --> 19:34.414
You get out of here too!
Come on! Get out!

20:12.484 --> 20:13.649
Inspector Broussard!

20:16.056 --> 20:19.049
- Are we going to wait any longer?
- I'll let you know.

20:19.602 --> 20:24.573
- My guys are on the roof for 8 hours already and it's raining.
- I see. We have a plenty of time.

20:28.119 --> 20:29.267
Moron.

20:39.068 --> 20:41.031
Open! The police.

20:44.013 --> 20:46.141
The Police! The building is surrounded!

20:54.962 --> 20:56.778
The police! Open up!

20:57.361 --> 21:01.888
- The house is surrounded!
- What? What's going on?

21:02.053 --> 21:07.623
- Who is it? What do you want from me?
- Open or we kick the door!

21:08.832 --> 21:13.254
Go fuck yourselves!
I belong to Baader's!

21:13.316 --> 21:17.425
I'll blow it all up!
Long live revolution!

21:17.591 --> 21:19.511
Quickly, get dressed! Move yourself!

21:19.990 --> 21:22.952
Of course...
Danke schon.

21:23.222 --> 21:26.289
That's enough Jacques, you lost.

21:28.323 --> 21:33.546
- Who do you think you are talking to me like that?
- Robert Broussard, police inspector.

21:37.326 --> 21:42.392
Aha, Broussard, the one with the moustache like a sailor.
All newspapers write about you.

21:43.730 --> 21:45.156
Exactly.

21:45.816 --> 21:48.837
- Let's end this circus. Give up!
- I don't care!

21:49.726 --> 21:53.185
How can I trust you?
Slip your identity card through the door so I can see it.

21:53.689 --> 21:57.075
- So you could shoot me?
- Or you me, when i try to pick it up?

21:58.277 --> 21:59.651
You're right.

22:08.132 --> 22:11.643
So then what? I'm giving you my word,
you can trust me.

22:12.616 --> 22:17.066
I won't fire.
Come on Broussard, don't hesitate.

22:21.011 --> 22:23.531
- Ok Jacques.
- I'm waiting.

22:25.703 --> 22:26.868
Catch.

22:43.431 --> 22:44.596
So what?

22:52.399 --> 22:53.877
- Broussard?
- yes?

22:57.248 --> 23:00.029
- I have two requirements.
- I hope they're reasonable...

23:01.732 --> 23:04.513
First one is that you won't touch the girl who's
here with me.

23:05.486 --> 23:08.299
And second one, I need 20 minutes to get
something in the order.

23:09.128 --> 23:11.500
Do you have any other wish?
Would you like a car with a driver?

23:11.848 --> 23:15.703
If I want to maybe that too.
You are not in position to negotiate, Broussard.

23:17.218 --> 23:18.831
So? I'm waiting!

23:22.067 --> 23:23.201
So what is it!

23:24.726 --> 23:26.830
You got 20 minutes, Jacques. 20 minutes!

23:31.869 --> 23:33.504
Jacques, what should i do?

23:37.084 --> 23:39.375
Answer me, Jacques.
Can i help you with something?

23:41.880 --> 23:44.140
- What are they going to do with me?
- Bring me the matches from the table.

23:44.331 --> 23:46.466
- I'm scared.
- Bring the matches!

23:52.204 --> 23:53.317
Here you go.

23:53.403 --> 23:57.697
They'll arrest me. You think they put me in jail?
I don't want to go to jail...

23:58.722 --> 24:01.764
- Calm down. Easy.
- How can i calm down, they will...

24:01.798 --> 24:03.015
Calm down!

24:04.249 --> 24:06.769
Are you finished? Are you calm?

24:11.548 --> 24:18.063
- What will they do with me?
- Don't worry. Everything will be all right.

24:23.488 --> 24:24.810
Just easy, quiet...

24:40.226 --> 24:43.997
What are you waiting for, Mesrine?
What are you trying to do over there?

24:45.440 --> 24:47.856
We gave you 20 minutes not 40.

24:47.942 --> 24:52.966
Broussard, are you brave enough to come in here without a gun
and bulletproof vest?

24:55.346 --> 25:01.308
- Why is that?
- I want to know, if you can do it.

25:02.802 --> 25:07.461
So, are you coming in or are you scared?

25:11.301 --> 25:12.779
Hey! Broussard?

25:15.160 --> 25:16.742
Well, ok then.

25:29.863 --> 25:33.009
See? I took the vest down and put gun away.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.721
And what about you?
Do you have a courage to come out without the gun?

25:40.500 --> 25:41.769
As you can see, I do.

25:49.468 --> 25:54.595
Hey you the artist, take a picture of us together.
The big glory moment of Inspector Broussard!

25:55.308 --> 25:56.681
If you insist.

26:00.105 --> 26:02.656
Didn't you wonder why i didn't kill you and your buddies?

26:03.066 --> 26:05.649
We cops do not wonder, but we act.

26:06.049 --> 26:10.550
Just because the woman was here.
Just because of that... that she was here.

26:10.898 --> 26:15.035
Next time there won't be a woman nor champaigne.
Just two of us.

26:19.814 --> 26:23.168
To our next meeting.

26:34.361 --> 26:37.278
Prison de la Sant?
Paris, 1973.

27:16.073 --> 27:17.290
Guard!

27:20.244 --> 27:21.461
Guard!

27:30.151 --> 27:34.914
- What do you need Jacques?
- What kind of guy is he, that Pinochet?

27:36.460 --> 27:40.440
- He's Chilean general.
- The general in Chile?

27:43.238 --> 27:46.385
The whole page about some Pinochet
but no a word about me!

27:46.732 --> 27:54.133
- There was a coup.
- A coup? Bring me the typewriter.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.813
- I want to write something!
- Alright, I try.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.002
Go!

28:00.028 --> 28:04.217
Pinochet. Pinochet!

28:15.565 --> 28:18.868
<i>County jail...</i>

28:49.248 --> 28:50.934
<i>" DEATH INSTINCT"
What do you think it is?</i>

28:52.064 --> 28:58.755
- This is my book.
- This is not a book, it is the death sentence.

28:59.676 --> 29:05.221
You have a trial in two months and you're publishing a book in which
you're confessing to committing 40 murders.

29:05.620 --> 29:08.662
At this moment all cops in France are studying your book.

29:08.749 --> 29:13.980
And after they finish, they use everything from your
memoirs in a indictment against you.

29:14.275 --> 29:19.820
- Well in that case they have to be retarded.
- What do you mean?

29:20.532 --> 29:25.034
- This is not the truth?
- Audience loves the  plot, the action...

29:26.581 --> 29:30.040
- And?
- And i don't think that jurry will believe

29:30.126 --> 29:34.628
that i am such an idiot, that would confess to something
that would put me on gilotene.

29:36.487 --> 29:40.468
And in the eyes of the nation I'm a Star.

29:42.223 --> 29:45.315
You entertain the nation but at the same time you horrify it.

29:45.351 --> 29:49.957
And as far as they can push the fear by not letting you go free,
they won't.

29:50.044 --> 29:55.067
So middle-class, such a funny honest word.

29:56.509 --> 29:58.331
They allowed you a visit.

30:48.076 --> 30:50.753
- I grew up.
- I see.

30:52.091 --> 30:57.114
- I cannot notice.
- I'm not a child anymore.

31:02.363 --> 31:08.794
- You really are beautiful.
- Thanks.

31:13.833 --> 31:20.994
- And how are... your brothers?
- Boris and Bruno are doing fine,

31:21.435 --> 31:24.540
they're acting like a fools otherwise nothing is new.

31:26.139 --> 31:30.901
- That's weird.
- Yes.

31:32.656 --> 31:39.035
- Didn't he ride his bike with some punks.
- Do you want play on a father...?

31:40.999 --> 31:46.126
- I didn't come here to be lectured.
- Alright, just be careful.

31:57.371 --> 32:05.314
- When you come back home?
- It won't be that soon.

32:11.344 --> 32:17.827
Honey i'm sorry...  i'd rather to meet you
under different circumstances.

32:18.644 --> 32:23.980
At least i know where i can always find you.

32:30.011 --> 32:31.592
I miss you.

32:49.928 --> 32:56.724
Jacques Merine, are you still denying
contact with Michele Ardouin?

32:57.019 --> 32:59.331
I already said I don't know him.
I do not know him!

32:59.418 --> 33:03.502
Michel Ardouin stand up so
Mesrine can see you better.

33:05.987 --> 33:09.968
I'm telling you i don't know him.
I would remember that nose for sure.

33:14.121 --> 33:19.666
Do you admit that you took chief judge as a hostage during your escape?

33:19.752 --> 33:23.629
I've hid behind the justice
as any decent citizen would.

33:24.184 --> 33:24.984
What's wrong about that?

33:27.678 --> 33:30.720
Nothing, if your escape doesn't change to kidnaping.

33:34.873 --> 33:45.215
Sir, in clothes from 101 dalmatians,
escape is everyone's bounden duty and the right,

33:45.406 --> 33:48.239
and it is a business too,

33:49.212 --> 33:54.809
and so i wouldn't just talk in the wind,
ladies and gentlemen, in my hand i have a key. Can you see?

33:56.042 --> 34:01.305
And do you know what kind of key it is?
It is by a coincidence a key for my handcuffs.

34:02.768 --> 34:06.384
Just look!
And do you know how did i get ahold of it?

34:06.575 --> 34:12.431
I simply bought it from my guard
for a half million of old franks.

34:13.353 --> 34:16.186
Sirs journalists, dear jury,

34:17.210 --> 34:21.922
this is your system, which you and prosecutor
are so defending it.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.632
We are honored by his presence.
inspector Broussard,

34:25.032 --> 34:30.473
who's sitting right next to journalists.
Inspector! Look at it yourself.

34:31.289 --> 34:32.558
I'm done.

34:32.853 --> 34:37.668
Tell us Mr. Mesrine, why would you need such a big arsenal of weapons
we found at your place?

34:42.239 --> 34:44.551
Your honor, how should i explain it...

34:44.741 --> 34:49.764
Since i was a kid, this unexplainable
feeling of vulnerability is following me.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.353
You should thank me...

34:54.438 --> 34:59.254
I analyze murderers, i help cops,
i provide work for the doctors at the emergency rooms.

35:04.190 --> 35:06.867
Before us we have a picture of nice looking man.

35:07.162 --> 35:11.278
But he is a gangster,
who doesn't hurt any one,

35:11.542 --> 35:15.001
he's even gentle to his victims...

35:15.973 --> 35:24.699
All this is just a pretence,
a mask covering a bestial animal.

35:26.245 --> 35:31.685
They don't exist good gangsters,
there are only gangsters and nothing more...

35:32.189 --> 35:34.710
and before you is standing one.

35:35.422 --> 35:43.261
Mesrine, you start shooting without thinking,
when you see that situation is getting out of your hands.

35:47.936 --> 35:52.124
Ladies and gentlemen, dear jury,
you're deciding today about the justice

35:52.263 --> 35:53.793
and you will bring the sentence.

35:53.984 --> 35:58.590
The society which doesn't punish criminals,
cannot be considered righteous.

36:14.423 --> 36:17.287
So I am the public enemy nbr. 1?!
What?

36:18.959 --> 36:20.489
This is all bullshit.

36:21.514 --> 36:26.120
I am the enemy of the government, the banks,
yes, it is right and accurate to jep

36:26.519 --> 36:28.518
I steal from them, that's why they don't like me,

36:29.335 --> 36:33.315
but when i steal from banks,
i don't feel like i'm breaking the law.

36:34.132 --> 36:36.444
I'm stealing from a bigger thief.

36:39.242 --> 36:44.578
Do you want to put me in jail,
throw out the key and forget about me?!

36:44.873 --> 36:47.602
Go ahead, just stick me in there!

36:47.897 --> 36:54.589
But remember what i said,
i'll run away from there. I promise you that!

36:56.448 --> 37:00.950
The jury with eight votes
found guilty and sentenced...

37:01.245 --> 37:05.257
Pierre Vondorin to 5 years
on probation.

37:05.990 --> 37:09.918
Michel Grangier to 7 years
in prison.

37:11.464 --> 37:16.175
Michel Ardouina to 10 years
in prison.

37:17.200 --> 37:23.266
Accused Jacques Mesrine
to 20 years in prison with maximum security.

37:31.330 --> 37:34.142
<i>March, 1978</i>

37:43.896 --> 37:48.606
- Do you have a light?
- Sure I do, Mr. Jacques.

37:54.011 --> 37:54.863
Thanks.

38:05.169 --> 38:06.751
- Hi, Luc.
- Hey Jacques.

38:17.787 --> 38:18.743
Hi.

38:23.627 --> 38:25.834
Are you sweating on purpose or is this normal?

38:33.533 --> 38:37.201
Could you at least answer me,
I am Jacques Mesrine.

38:38.956 --> 38:42.311
So what?
What you doing in my yard?

38:45.734 --> 38:49.610
Here, is not a custom to forbid anything from me.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.094
Yeah , i've noticed.

38:54.285 --> 39:00.977
- By the way, i have 3 escapes behind me.
- Me too.

39:05.235 --> 39:06.191
Maybe...

39:11.909 --> 39:15.816
...i'd like to try one more time.

39:19.834 --> 39:25.170
- My name is FranK is Besse.
- I know.

39:42.776 --> 39:43.941
Control.

39:57.949 --> 39:59.166
Control.

40:50.663 --> 40:52.797
- It's ok boss,  a tin foil is inside.
- Allright

41:17.359 --> 41:19.358
Mr. Jacques, your lawyer is here.

41:43.064 --> 41:48.692
- Boss, i'm cold i want to go back to cell.
- In two minutes, first we'll take Jacques back .

41:51.198 --> 41:52.415
Two minutes?

42:07.257 --> 42:08.474
Hello.

42:11.637 --> 42:15.492
- What's going on?
- It's about the story in Canada.

42:17.268 --> 42:20.779
- But i don't have your manuscripts.
- Then let's get it right.

42:22.325 --> 42:23.386
Boss! Boss!

42:25.037 --> 42:28.809
- What do you want?
- I need my manuscripts,

42:29.364 --> 42:32.771
i gave them to my neighbor.

42:32.806 --> 42:34.231
- To Bess?
- Yeah.

42:34.526 --> 42:37.360
Can you do me a favor and bring them here,
as fast as you can, please.

42:40.679 --> 42:43.544
- Ok.
- Thanks chief.

43:28.544 --> 43:30.751
If someone will get to know about this, nothing will help me.

43:35.322 --> 43:37.947
- I'm done.
- Don't worry,

43:38.138 --> 43:43.682
you are saving my life
and i won't be destroying yours.

43:44.812 --> 43:49.418
- Will everything go smoothly?
- Already did.

43:51.851 --> 43:53.797
Mesrine wants his manuscripts.

44:01.392 --> 44:04.538
- We got a problem.
- Move back.

44:33.824 --> 44:36.553
What's going on, why are you over here?

44:38.933 --> 44:43.644
Hey, what's happening here?!
Both of you go inside, hurry!

44:43.730 --> 44:45.208
- Pistols.
- Catch!

44:46.337 --> 44:49.588
- Lets go, take off your clothes! Quick, Quick!
- Hey, what's going on over there?

44:49.674 --> 44:53.029

44:53.481 --> 44:57.409
- Move on!
- I'm with you,I'm with you!

44:57.495 --> 45:00.850
- To the wall! Face to the wall! Move!

45:01.041 --> 45:04.708
- Shut up!
- Guys, take me with you.

45:07.089 --> 45:11.278
- I save your life.
- Move it! Get in the cell!

45:11.678 --> 45:14.824
Lets go, Lets go! Get in the cell!
Move it!

45:17.517 --> 45:20.768
Listen to me! You're a prisoner, get it?!
Prisoner!

45:25.234 --> 45:26.712
Here, catch!

45:27.945 --> 45:31.717

46:02.045 --> 46:03.627

46:04.861 --> 46:06.964
Go! Go, be quiet!

46:08.354 --> 46:10.301
Not a word! Move yourself!

46:11.952 --> 46:14.994

46:16.697 --> 46:23.545
Who wants to go with us?
Let's go! Bad for you! - Move it!

46:57.001 --> 47:00.982

47:04.874 --> 47:06.508
Give me the gloves!

47:10.140 --> 47:11.827
Francois, here are the gloves!

47:15.928 --> 47:17.979
- Cover us!
- What? - Cover us!

47:27.399 --> 47:29.033
Whoever moves i'll shoot him!

47:36.211 --> 47:37.271
Hang the rope.

48:12.605 --> 48:16.304
Stop! Police is confiscating the car.
Get out!

48:16.463 --> 48:20.892
- Move yourself! Jump off the rope, quick!
- Get out of the car.

48:23.971 --> 48:26.075
- Step out, please.
- Get out of the car!

48:30.385 --> 48:32.123
Get out!!

48:35.442 --> 48:41.195
- Jump in! - Chris!
- Get inside, quick!

48:52.336 --> 48:53.396
Jump in!

48:55.881 --> 48:56.942
Lets go!

49:07.509 --> 49:11.989
Shocking ending. The pursuing by Red brigades
from all over Italy.

49:12.253 --> 49:13.731
Ended by murder.

49:14.235 --> 49:15.712
Alda More is dead.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.258
Leader of Christian Democrats
paid by his life

49:19.344 --> 49:24.712
for hideous intimidating by terrorists.
This threat could be avoided.

49:25.028 --> 49:29.165
Anonymous caller noticed parked car
near to headquarters...

49:29.251 --> 49:34.796
of Communist party,

49:34.882 --> 49:37.924
inside of which was found dead body
of man, Alda Mora.

49:38.219 --> 49:45.672
- Where you been? You could say something.
- Jean-Luc, it's my honor and pleasure,

49:45.800 --> 49:52.033
to introduce to you princess Annie
and princess Christiane.

49:52.297 --> 49:54.818
- Good evening.
- My cousin Jean-Luc,

49:54.904 --> 49:56.903
- as you can see, he's armed.
- Yeah.

49:56.990 --> 50:00.136
Take a seat next to him and surround him
by your warm and charm.

50:01.161 --> 50:04.829
You see, how  badly he needs it?

50:07.418 --> 50:09.625
- Is it real?
- Take your hands off it!

50:11.537 --> 50:20.992
- So, do we begin?
- Bruno, come here for a moment.

50:21.913 --> 50:29.856
My princesses, excuse me for a moment.
Wait here, i'll be right back.

50:33.749 --> 50:36.113
- What's up?
- What kind of whores are they?

50:36.408 --> 50:38.198
- Franéžis, they're not whores.
- Then who are they?

50:38.254 --> 50:43.308
They're two charming students,
who wants to have fun and we gonna help them with it.

50:43.916 --> 50:50.191
We have to inform you that Public enemy
nbr. 1 is still free.

50:50.277 --> 50:51.755
- Wait.
- What for?

50:51.841 --> 50:54.466
- We don't have a time for this.
- Francis, sexual passion...

50:54.553 --> 50:56.239
is natural human necessity.

50:56.534 --> 51:02.183
- I didn't have a girl for 5 years...
- Do what i do, devote yourself to sport.

51:03.208 --> 51:05.416
...two other prisoners ran away
with Mesrine,

51:05.471 --> 51:08.336
one was shot and the other succeded
to escape.

51:08.526 --> 51:12.090
Escapees are armed.
They managed to obtain the gun,

51:12.176 --> 51:15.010
which helped them to remove all witnesses
during the jailbreak.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.408
- Francis, don't spoil my plans.
- Go fuck yourself!

51:20.206 --> 51:23.905
We're gonna go. Your friend doesn't
like our presence.

51:24.273 --> 51:31.486
Wait, wait! Come to me!
Francis, shit, you frightened them.

51:31.937 --> 51:33.780
Turn the tv on.

51:35.014 --> 51:38.681
- Don't trust journalists, they babble nonsense.
- I think i'll take a walk.

51:40.228 --> 51:44.448
Come on, again? Francis! Francis!

51:44.712 --> 51:48.692
- That was you on tv, wasn't it?
- You know the answer.

51:49.092 --> 51:51.299
- Jacques Mesrine.
- No, Merine.

51:52.429 --> 51:53.593
Jacques Merine.

51:54.827 --> 51:58.390
- Nice to meet you.
- Jacques Merine, nice to meet you too.

52:16.100 --> 52:18.829
Police inspector Vaugier and
divisional inspector Lerio.

52:19.281 --> 52:21.645
- Hello.
- Hello.

52:23.087 --> 52:26.369
- Is your boss here?
- No, he isn't. I'm covering him today.

52:28.093 --> 52:31.969
- Is always so many people here?
- You arrived from Paris

52:32.024 --> 52:35.546
to find out how many people is here?
- Without comments, corporal.

52:40.189 --> 52:44.170
- Tell me, how many of you are working here?
- Here, a few tens of employees.

52:44.882 --> 52:50.458
- Well, what did i say? It's not that bad.
- Not at all. - No doubt.

52:51.034 --> 52:55.015
- Why are you here?
- Obviously you know,

52:55.070 --> 52:59.707
that your cutthroats escaped from prison.
Did you hear any gossip about their plans?

53:00.472 --> 53:07.143
- It's about Besse and Mesrine.
- No, i didn't. And you think they could come here?

53:07.354 --> 53:10.167
You never know with these guys, corporal.

53:10.796 --> 53:14.724
Be careful, especially the shorter one,
because he is very dangerous.

53:14.915 --> 53:17.748
- Sure.
- Sure...

53:19.503 --> 53:24.870
Henry, we should be on our way.
We have a lot of work to do. Thank you, corporal.

53:26.073 --> 53:31.336
What we can do.
See you later.

53:38.274 --> 53:40.721
We thought there will be like 5 of them
but they have the whole regimnet there.

53:41.089 --> 53:44.788
Don't whine! Even if they had a whole army in there
you would act like a chicken.

53:46.147 --> 53:47.260
See you.

54:35.576 --> 54:38.806
- Are you talking about counterfeit money?
- Yes, exactly.

54:41.103 --> 54:43.571
And you'd probably like to check my safe.

54:44.544 --> 54:45.761
That would be nice.

54:54.399 --> 54:57.440
Do you have a court order?

55:00.760 --> 55:03.729
No no, please.
The court order.

55:04.983 --> 55:06.200
- Court order.
- Yes.

55:09.624 --> 55:14.125
He's right. Do you have a warrant, inspector?
I have it...

55:15.776 --> 55:19.027
I have a brilliant order, clearly it is a metal one.
Let's go grandpa, fill up the bag.

55:20.625 --> 55:25.388
To the safe, move! Let's go, hurry!
Open the safe!

55:31.210 --> 55:34.564
Don't stare at me, help him out!
Hurry up!

56:19.961 --> 56:20.792
Run!

56:42.642 --> 56:43.911
Get in!

56:48.013 --> 56:49.230
Come on, go already!

57:01.413 --> 57:02.473
Hang on!

57:13.196 --> 57:14.153
Move!

57:20.600 --> 57:23.642
- Shit!
- What? Why did you stop?

57:25.606 --> 57:26.562
Damn!

57:49.330 --> 57:50.755
Platoon ready.

57:52.458 --> 57:53.675
Only leg...

57:55.847 --> 58:00.172
Leaders of platoons. Get ready for the operation!
Turn right!

58:00.383 --> 58:01.809
Give me your tie.

58:02.365 --> 58:03.582
Get in!

58:06.901 --> 58:07.857
Hang on.

59:22.192 --> 59:28.571
Jacques Merine together with his accomplice
Francis Besse...

59:28.761 --> 59:37.257
ran away from the crime scene in a car. Gangsters...
- Enough of it, right?

59:42.422 --> 59:45.078
This is a way better.
We change the clothes...

59:53.424 --> 59:54.641
Thanks for them.

01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:50.118
What do you say
if instead of school...

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:54.842
we would make a trip with uncle Francis
and uncle Jacques?

01:00:55.523 --> 01:01:01.307
with dad and mom too, if they want to?
What?

01:01:01.988 --> 01:01:06.834
We'll vote.
I'm for it. Francis, what about you?

01:01:10.592 --> 01:01:19.942
Aha, now it's two of us.
And dad? He agrees too. And mom?

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.482
and kids.
Excellent, everyone agrees.

01:01:29.623 --> 01:01:31.413
Great, perfect!

01:01:37.965 --> 01:01:39.130
So, are we going?

01:01:53.764 --> 01:01:57.901
- careful... hang on.
- Damn!

01:02:00.907 --> 01:02:06.035
- Come here. What's your name?
- Daniel.

01:02:06.955 --> 01:02:10.936
Do you know how to get to Chafourux?

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:15.524
You take us and drop us off overthere.
Do we have a deal?

01:02:17.383 --> 01:02:22.511
I don't have to tell you what happens if...

01:02:25.622 --> 01:02:26.891
Good.

01:02:33.651 --> 01:02:35.129
We can go.

01:02:38.031 --> 01:02:40.447
Go, Go, faster!

01:02:41.368 --> 01:02:43.576
Keep going, keep going.

01:02:44.392 --> 01:02:46.078
Faster, faster!

01:02:48.668 --> 01:02:50.250
Hello, madam. Control.

01:03:05.353 --> 01:03:06.517
What's going on?

01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:10.689
Control.

01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:12.774
Could you please open the trunk?

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:17.675
- Put the armrest back and turn off the radio!
- Kids, put it back.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.809
God, help us.

01:03:32.361 --> 01:03:35.716
Keep going please.
Faster, go.

01:03:36.845 --> 01:03:37.906
Stop!

01:03:39.035 --> 01:03:43.224
Madam, have you noticed anything out of ordinary?
We check your car.

01:03:43.728 --> 01:03:45.226
Open the trunk please

01:03:54.469 --> 01:03:55.738
Ok thank you.

01:03:55.929 --> 01:03:57.511
Just sit here quietly.

01:03:59.996 --> 01:04:01.098
Bye madam.

01:04:06.878 --> 01:04:10.024
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.706
- You haven't noticed on your way anything out of ordinary?
- No.

01:04:21.895 --> 01:04:23.581
- Everything alright kids?
- Yes.

01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:26.709
- We must to check your car.
- I'm on the road from 4 am!

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.046
- When do you finally get that Mesrine?
- Step out of the car.

01:04:30.863 --> 01:04:36.199
- Open the trunk.
- What's going on? I don't have anything there!

01:04:39.205 --> 01:04:45.793
- Don't argue, we must to check it out.
- I said i don't have anything there!

01:04:46.505 --> 01:04:49.860
You can go sir. Go, Go already!

01:05:26.132 --> 01:05:27.505
Nobody is here.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:06.610
Daniel, come closer.
Come here! Don't be afraid!

01:06:17.646 --> 01:06:18.707
Here, it's yours.

01:06:21.974 --> 01:06:25.798
Reward for your trouble,
but mainly for being quiet.

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:28.645
I understand. Okay.

01:06:28.909 --> 01:06:32.576
- How much did you give him?
- Some change, around hundred.

01:06:32.767 --> 01:06:37.478
- Hundred thousand for these lousy clothes?
You're some businessman. - Come on, stop!

01:06:37.773 --> 01:06:40.533
- You good. Go.
- Thank you.

01:06:41.892 --> 01:06:42.900
Bye.

01:07:34.606 --> 01:07:36.188
Soldiers just arrived.

01:07:43.887 --> 01:07:45.677
- Here it is.
- Are you sure?

01:07:45.868 --> 01:07:53.185
We can cross here. Look.
Hand me that wood. Do you doubt that?

01:07:54.315 --> 01:07:58.399
- Well it doesn't seem...
- Do you see that? Look.

01:07:58.799 --> 01:08:02.362
- He's not sure. See?
- Ok?

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:08.515
Well, go.

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:17.587
You see? Here is shallow water, look and
you didn't believe me.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:21.133
Oops, a little bit deeper here.

01:08:22.575 --> 01:08:23.531
Shit!

01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:25.095
Are you coming?

01:08:34.202 --> 01:08:35.732
Here, hold on to it.

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:42.823
Good, good... Watch out there's a hole!

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:47.307
- Here, take it. Hold it!
- What are you doing?

01:08:47.602 --> 01:08:50.435
- I'll thow the money on river bank.
- Cut it out! It's too far!

01:08:50.491 --> 01:08:56.692
- Calm down! Don't you trust me again?
- Don't throw it! Don't do it, it's too far!

01:09:01.471 --> 01:09:05.973
- Shit!
- Stop! Watch out!

01:09:07.103 --> 01:09:08.997
Come back Francis! Francis!

01:09:10.335 --> 01:09:13.689
- Shit!
- Francis, they drifted away!

01:09:18.051 --> 01:09:20.363
- That was your share!
- Good then.

01:09:23.162 --> 01:09:30.688
- What's in those bushes over there? Look Jacques!
- A little boat. You kidding me.

01:10:01.954 --> 01:10:05.101
...and the search of the area
continued the whole night,

01:10:05.396 --> 01:10:10.106
despite the effort of the dogs,
helicopters and armed forces,

01:10:10.193 --> 01:10:17.197
we must confirm that their effort was fruitless.

01:10:58.266 --> 01:11:00.484
- Hi. - Hello.
- Hello.

01:11:10.154 --> 01:11:19.870
- So? Are you gonna buy me a drink?
- Chapaigne, the best one you have.

01:11:21.104 --> 01:11:23.436
- Do you have Crystal?
- Yes, of course.

01:11:24.336 --> 01:11:25.918
Give me the bottle.

01:11:37.163 --> 01:11:40.413
- What's your name?
- Sylvia.

01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:46.253
And you? What's your name?

01:11:47.174 --> 01:11:52.718
- Jacques! Jacques! Jacques!
- So what's my name? What is it?

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:12.532
- I read my horoscope in the morning.
- And? What did it say?

01:12:16.372 --> 01:12:18.163
That i fall in love.

01:12:19.605 --> 01:12:22.647
Paris, July 1978.

01:12:22.734 --> 01:12:24.837
So, Isabelle? Where's my gift?

01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:39.019
- Thanks.
- Can we begin?

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:41.417
Be brave Isabelle, get on me.

01:12:46.301 --> 01:12:47.779
Why are you doing this?

01:13:02.256 --> 01:13:03.838
Because i don't like the laws.

01:13:04.133 --> 01:13:07.488
i don't like the laws and i don't want
to be a slave of the alarm clock the whole my life.

01:13:07.543 --> 01:13:10.616
I don't want the whole my life just to dream.
I don't want always to think,

01:13:10.671 --> 01:13:14.579
how i have to work a half year,
so i could buy some thing.

01:13:14.665 --> 01:13:18.020
- No. No!
- What do you expect from the life?

01:13:19.984 --> 01:13:24.100
-Recognition? Money?
- Money, Money! All of you...

01:13:24.155 --> 01:13:28.344
just keep talking abot them, always the same.
But i'm completely different.

01:13:28.743 --> 01:13:33.975
What exactly am i doing?
I'm looking for the money in the places where they are, that means in the banks.

01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:39.012
Regarding the politics,
are you on the left or the right?

01:13:39.588 --> 01:13:43.986
Neither side. I think politics are dirty game
it's better to keep the distance from it.

01:13:44.281 --> 01:13:46.593
I don't trust any politician.

01:13:47.201 --> 01:13:55.592
- Do you consider yourself as a dangerous individual?
- Dangerous... And according to you?

01:13:57.003 --> 01:14:02.131
I don't know, maybe i'm dangerous. I don't know.
Why are you asking?

01:14:04.355 --> 01:14:09.430
Depends to whom.
For instance i don't play with cops...

01:14:10.873 --> 01:14:12.246
Shoot it!

01:14:13.845 --> 01:14:15.374
Good photograph, publish it!

01:14:17.442 --> 01:14:24.447
Dangerous...
Probably yes. I'm probably dangerous.

01:14:24.742 --> 01:14:33.102
- What kind of old age and death will you have?
- Old age. Honestly, i don't think i'll live that long.

01:14:34.857 --> 01:14:40.298
One day they shoot me to death, it completly makes sense.
Natural.

01:14:42.157 --> 01:14:46.137
After all for some one who was in prison with maximum security,
there are no rules.

01:14:46.537 --> 01:14:50.309
- Like me, i live without rules.
- Without rules and without hope?

01:14:52.585 --> 01:14:56.044
- Do you have any plans?
- I've got a lot of plans. Plans...

01:14:56.235 --> 01:14:59.381
Close the prison with maximum security.
I lived there for 5 years.

01:14:59.468 --> 01:15:04.209
Can you imagine? The whole 5 years!
i want all of those who sit there to let go!

01:15:04.577 --> 01:15:06.472
I've seen over there, how they break people,
how they destroy them.

01:15:07.914 --> 01:15:11.373
But our Mr. Minister, Alain Perfite
he didn't get it yet,

01:15:11.668 --> 01:15:16.379
i am an excellent shooter and i can kill a few judges.

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:21.103
Do we need in France gangs of Bordeleo?
Do we need Red brigades?

01:15:21.721 --> 01:15:25.243
Let them ask themselves the question.
Because if there will be need to go in their neighborhoods,

01:15:25.329 --> 01:15:29.518
to train with Palestinians, I'll go!
They can shit their pants!

01:15:29.813 --> 01:15:34.033
- Do you want something to drink? Coffee?
- with delight. - Sugar?

01:15:44.934 --> 01:15:54.546
- Jacques Merine.
- Yes? - They write about you in "Match".

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:16.997
Not even a year have passed.

01:16:22.475 --> 01:16:29.271
Today's menu, lamb legs.
I'm getting sick of these english meals.

01:16:38.221 --> 01:16:41.055
"if there will be need to join Palestinian,
i'll come..."

01:16:42.184 --> 01:16:46.894
"if there will be need , i'll start wave of violence
France never seen before".

01:16:47.085 --> 01:16:52.421
- I said it and i will do it.
- "I'm the expert on explosives". Moron!

01:16:52.716 --> 01:16:56.384
- Next?
- "...can kill a few judges"

01:16:56.471 --> 01:17:01.390
- What kind of nonsense is this?!
- It's not a nonsense.

01:17:02.206 --> 01:17:04.935
- It's a revolution.
- A what? - A revolution!

01:17:05.126 --> 01:17:08.481
We are a criminals, not a revolutionists.
We are not going to destroy the system.

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.216
You see honey? This is typical
little cry baby.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.657
Sam is short, his ideals are small.

01:17:21.394 --> 01:17:26.208
I'm not overestimating my power
and i'm not calling for vendetta against the state.

01:17:26.295 --> 01:17:27.877
- That's it!
- Yeah, that's it.

01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:33.956
Well, i won't sign your magazine then.

01:17:36.877 --> 01:17:38.650
You can wipe your ass with it.

01:17:39.017 --> 01:17:45.083
- Please stop it. Francis, come to the table.
- I don't work like this.

01:17:45.274 --> 01:17:49.046
Simple just know how to use media.
That's all.

01:17:49.237 --> 01:17:53.457
- We have to talk.
- Anytime. But now come to the table.

01:17:54.242 --> 01:17:59.192
I'm inviting you to the table of accused.

01:18:02.168 --> 01:18:08.963
i have a great plan.
we kidnap a billionaire.

01:18:11.761 --> 01:18:14.595
- What are we going to do?
- What kind of question is that? Think about it.

01:18:14.681 --> 01:18:24.606
I tell you, the one i've chose
is a big fat cat.

01:18:24.901 --> 01:18:27.734
Old fart is forcing people to live in rabbit holes.

01:18:29.176 --> 01:18:36.494
It's a serious thing, you can trust me.
And then... You know what we gonna do then?

01:18:37.414 --> 01:18:42.333
We'll buy the bazookas and we attack the prison.

01:18:48.155 --> 01:18:51.844
Listen Jacques, we attack the prison,
again why not...

01:18:52.848 --> 01:18:59.780
- And then? What else do you want to drag me in to?
- After all... - Besides you're not going ever stop.

01:19:00.982 --> 01:19:05.411
You want to destroy this sytem
and on contrary i want to profit from it.

01:19:08.021 --> 01:19:12.470
simply you're fool,
you don't realize the consequences.

01:19:15.529 --> 01:19:21.053
- Fool? - Fool.
- What's this fool? I don't understand you at all.

01:19:24.914 --> 01:19:28.561
Sarthe, june 1979.

01:19:41.964 --> 01:19:47.123
- Hi, how are you? Is Mr. Lelirre at home?
- I'm his son. And you are?

01:19:51.558 --> 01:19:55.226
Inspector Vaugier, police.
Can we go in?

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:07.041
- What's going on?
- Do you own a few houses for rent?

01:20:08.191 --> 01:20:09.304
We'd like to talk about that.

01:20:13.144 --> 01:20:14.205
Wait.

01:20:14.813 --> 01:20:15.769
Thank you.

01:20:21.174 --> 01:20:23.903
Two cops are here and they
want to talk to you.

01:20:37.911 --> 01:20:42.152
- How can i be to use for you gentlemen?
- We received a complaint from...

01:20:42.207 --> 01:20:44.895
a few renters of your apartments,
regarding a bad living conditions.

01:20:45.471 --> 01:20:47.679
We ask you to come with us
to police station.

01:20:48.339 --> 01:20:52.059
- Couldn't we to take care of it here?
- Please, how would it look like.

01:20:52.302 --> 01:20:58.764
Well in that case let's go.
I hope it won't take too long.

01:20:59.706 --> 01:21:03.978
- Tell Charlie, to get the car ready...
- That won't be necessary, we have a car.

01:21:05.232 --> 01:21:10.443
- We can bring you back.
- Excellent, lets go then.

01:21:12.793 --> 01:21:13.958
Thank you for understanding.

01:21:23.638 --> 01:21:28.036
From now on you're in hands
of Palestine Liberation Organization.

01:21:28.331 --> 01:21:34.637
What? Palestine?
And what's my connection with it?

01:21:35.317 --> 01:21:40.445
We rent apartments in Paris and
i'm not a jew.

01:21:41.053 --> 01:21:42.113
What's the difference?

01:21:44.286 --> 01:21:52.886
- You will pay me. I'm Jacques Mesrine.
- Mesrine? - right.

01:21:56.486 --> 01:21:58.068
How long am i gonna be here?

01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:09.122
Depends on you.
If you reach deep in your pockets you can go home.

01:22:11.086 --> 01:22:14.336
- How much do you need?
- 10 millions in cash.

01:22:15.674 --> 01:22:17.360
- 10 millions?
- Yeah.

01:22:17.447 --> 01:22:28.550
What are... 10 millions is too much.
I'll dissapoint you, but i'm 82 years old. I rather be killed.

01:22:37.156 --> 01:22:44.369
- Then give us eight.
- No. - I didn't understand. - No.

01:22:45.186 --> 01:22:47.080
Do you think we are morons, you old fart?

01:22:49.305 --> 01:22:51.564
- Seven and we go separate ways for good!
- No!

01:22:52.694 --> 01:23:00.564
- How much can you pay me then, you penny pincher?
- Six... in four payments.

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:04.078
Aha, in four payments?! In four!

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:10.158
So, you'll pay in three payments
and if you try to screw me,

01:23:10.265 --> 01:23:15.445
i put the bullet in you, for free! Got it?
- Yes.

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:18.677
- Did you get it?
- Yes, i did.

01:23:21.475 --> 01:23:23.162
Right word of obedient old man.

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:31.191
Excellent, realy good cognac.
We are not that different Mr. Mesrine.

01:23:31.486 --> 01:23:35.707
We both like good things and to get them,

01:23:36.075 --> 01:23:43.392
we have to steal from honest hard
working man. And why not?

01:23:44.938 --> 01:23:50.483
What are you talking about? We've got nothing in common.
You are an exploiter and i'm a revolutionary.

01:23:50.674 --> 01:23:51.943
It's not the same thing.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:00.390
- Mr. Mesrine, what's the difference
between a revolutionary and gangster?
- What is it, a riddle?

01:24:01.832 --> 01:24:10.714
A Revolutionary would already put a bullet in my head
and left my body in a trunk of some car,

01:24:11.113 --> 01:24:21.142
in the meanwhile gangster needs a ransom,
he wants the money and then he let me go free.

01:24:21.854 --> 01:24:23.540
Will you do it too?

01:24:26.338 --> 01:24:28.024
You forgot the third option.

01:24:30.457 --> 01:24:34.594
I'll take your money, put a bullet in your head
and i put you in a trunk.

01:24:35.932 --> 01:24:39.495
- How about that?
- In that case, everything they write abou you in newspapers,

01:24:39.582 --> 01:24:47.212
Mesrine is honorable gangster,
he stands behind his word, all of it is just crap.

01:24:50.427 --> 01:24:53.677
<i>- Jacques, look!
...accomplice of wanted Jacques Mesrine,</i>

01:24:53.764 --> 01:24:58.057
<i>Francis Besse, with whom he escaped
from prison in De la Sant?</i>

01:24:58.058 --> 01:24:59.101
Mesrine...

01:24:59.186 --> 01:25:04.001
After a few months Besse
parted ways with the Public enemy Nbr.1

01:25:04.088 --> 01:25:09.215
Belgian police arrested Bessa
and his three accomplices not far from Brussels,

01:25:09.302 --> 01:25:13.386
in cooperation with french counter-terrorist agency.

01:25:13.473 --> 01:25:17.558
Belgian police...
- Only the biggest moron...

01:25:17.644 --> 01:25:20.060
could get caught by belgian cops.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:25.900
As i know him he won't stay
there for too long.

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:32.470
Your excellency, i invite you to the table.

01:25:41.942 --> 01:25:45.192
- For now it's calm, nothing is happening.
- Have a look.

01:25:51.014 --> 01:25:56.454
- We've been stuck here for too long. When will we go to get the money?
- Let him wait. It's better to wait...

01:26:37.732 --> 01:26:42.025
- Wait, somebody stopped next to Lefebvre's car.
Let me see.

01:26:47.586 --> 01:26:49.429
Asshole, i saw it.

01:26:50.975 --> 01:26:52.662
They're cops, scumbags.

01:26:54.938 --> 01:26:59.753
Let's test the toughness of their glasses.

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:06.114
So you brought the cops?
Here you go!

01:27:12.979 --> 01:27:16.542
You wanted to screw me!
Just wait.

01:27:33.939 --> 01:27:36.147
Let's split. Move it!

01:27:58.237 --> 01:28:00.653
Your shitty son double crossed me,
he talked to cops!

01:28:06.266 --> 01:28:08.995
I swear, it won't happen again.

01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:20.570
It's in your interest,
trust me.

01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:42.678
I have two good news.

01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:49.143
First: old grandpa can go back home
because his famous son...

01:28:50.064 --> 01:28:55.713
paid first payment of ransom.
And second news... watch...

01:28:57.468 --> 01:29:02.700
Hold it! I'll take a picture of you.
"BESSE: MESRINE STYLE ESCAPE"

01:29:03.829 --> 01:29:09.061
Say cheese.
One, two, three... cheese.

01:29:10.190 --> 01:29:11.251
Done.

01:29:14.883 --> 01:29:15.839
Here!

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:20.532
Life is beautiful and full of suprises.

01:29:34.801 --> 01:29:37.112
Hello. Welcome.

01:29:37.199 --> 01:29:40.168
- If you allow me i'd like to show you...
- Stop it, i'll take this one.

01:29:40.432 --> 01:29:42.243
- I'll get the key right away.
- Hurry up!

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.734
...la la la, don't give a shit.

01:30:22.353 --> 01:30:26.229
Move!

01:30:27.358 --> 01:30:28.627
Where are the cops?

01:30:36.848 --> 01:30:38.117
And here we are.

01:31:04.586 --> 01:31:05.751
Try that one.

01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:13.155
How much is it?

01:31:22.418 --> 01:31:24.626
- I give up.
- You're under arrest.

01:31:25.547 --> 01:31:26.712
Do you like it?

01:31:27.528 --> 01:31:28.484
Here you go.

01:31:40.668 --> 01:31:46.421
Last year, in may of 1979, when was Mesrine
sentenced to 20 years in prison,

01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:51.739
the only thing was on his mind, how to escape,
because he always needs...

01:31:51.826 --> 01:31:55.910
to draw attention on himself and confirm
his reputation as "The Public Enemy nbr.1".

01:31:56.675 --> 01:31:59.873
Paris, August of 1979.

01:32:16.644 --> 01:32:17.705
Charly!

01:32:20.607 --> 01:32:22.444
Charly Bauer, invisible man.

01:32:24.778 --> 01:32:29.176
- It's not easy to get together with you.
- You know, i have so little time, Jacques.

01:32:29.367 --> 01:32:32.513
Organization, comrades to which
i report...

01:32:33.225 --> 01:32:39.187
I completely forgot, your ultra-left
comrades want to thank you...

01:32:39.273 --> 01:32:45.026
something to drink, to eat, to go out. Is it true?
- You think, you destroy the system by yourself?

01:32:45.843 --> 01:32:49.406
No, i don't think so, i know so.
I know what i am doing.

01:32:50.483 --> 01:32:52.326
Have you read the newspapers? And my book?

01:32:52.381 --> 01:32:58.792
- Have you read my book?
- Some parts. And not all of it i liked,

01:32:59.817 --> 01:33:02.754
because there's nothing in it I could relate to.

01:33:02.945 --> 01:33:04.944
nor what i fight for...

01:33:05.344 --> 01:33:06.717
I tell it to you this way,

01:33:06.908 --> 01:33:12.035
if we've met during the war in Algeria,
we would fight against each other.

01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:19.231
- I know that and i would kill you.
- Don't be mistaken,

01:33:19.421 --> 01:33:21.869
just because you and me don't have anything...

01:33:28.181 --> 01:33:33.934
Ok... i've to go
home, to my family.

01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:36.541
- Keep in touch.
- Yeah.

01:33:46.952 --> 01:33:52.913
- If you need something don't be shy.
- It'll happen soon, friend.

01:34:00.195 --> 01:34:06.240
What kind of moves are these? What?
Where are your manners?

01:34:07.078 --> 01:34:10.328
- What manners?
- Shaking your butt in front of my friend.

01:34:19.174 --> 01:34:23.155
- What should i say to you. You're just a cheap whore.
- What's that?

01:34:25.014 --> 01:34:30.142
- Should I remind you where i bought you?
- You bought me? Nobody ever bought me!

01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:35.147
- Anybody with some extra money.
- I said that nobody ever paid for me!

01:34:35.442 --> 01:34:38.588
I'll never be bought!
If you'd just appreciate me a little bit,

01:34:38.675 --> 01:34:42.030
you wouldn't talk like that.
- You talk about respect? Come here!

01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:46.931
You're going talk about respect?
And the same time you're acting like a whore
in front of my friend!

01:34:47.017 --> 01:34:49.329
- What friend?
- Shut up! Listen to me.

01:34:49.624 --> 01:34:54.126
He was in jail with me. In jail!
And that's enough.

01:35:00.052 --> 01:35:06.640
Francis was your friend, but you always must have
the last word, that's why you're alone!

01:35:08.499 --> 01:35:10.915
That's how you end up...  completely alone!

01:35:14.756 --> 01:35:23.116
- Why? You want to leave me?
- What are you talking about?

01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:29.060
- Sylvia, you don't love me anymore?
- Leave me alone.

01:35:29.251 --> 01:35:33.544
- Don't you love me anymore?
- I want us to leave. To leave.

01:35:33.735 --> 01:35:36.986
- We'll leave, honey.
- You always lie. - No, i don't.

01:35:37.281 --> 01:35:43.034
We won't go anywhere, they'll kill you. You will
get killed. - No, nobody will die.

01:35:44.893 --> 01:35:49.603
- Promise it. Promise it!
- I promise you, no one will die.

01:36:05.749 --> 01:36:10.376
- Charly.
- Hi.

01:36:13.362 --> 01:36:16.925
Hey you little. My little man.

01:36:21.704 --> 01:36:24.120
You're my little man.

01:36:26.918 --> 01:36:30.064
No, that's not your mom.
Dear, take a care of visitors.

01:36:34.218 --> 01:36:39.450
Awful conditions and at the same time an effort
to break you down, humiliate you.

01:36:40.266 --> 01:36:44.455
That's true. They lock you up so they can
make an animal out of you, living dead.

01:36:44.646 --> 01:36:47.062
We need to end this repressive, agressive system,

01:36:47.097 --> 01:36:49.482
whos existence is based on judgements.

01:36:50.381 --> 01:36:53.111
Are you aware, that gilotine compared to prison
with maximum security...

01:36:53.197 --> 01:36:55.019
it's like amnesty?

01:36:57.629 --> 01:37:02.621
1) blow up the prison
2) free up our comrades

01:37:03.625 --> 01:37:05.624
3) build an army together.

01:37:06.024 --> 01:37:09.514
Do you want to screw the system?
Then you're only pickpocketing thief.

01:37:10.195 --> 01:37:13.967
- The need to rob from banks and not...
- Banks will always be around.

01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:22.205
What are you doing with the money after robberies?
You're buying expensive jewelry for your girl
and cars for yourself.

01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:28.284
Actually you're not fighting the system
but you're supporting it.

01:37:31.677 --> 01:37:36.314
- I escaped from prison many times.
- How many times did you get caught?

01:37:36.995 --> 01:37:40.037
- Have you given any thought to it?
- They won't get me anymore.

01:37:41.166 --> 01:37:44.448
They'll have to kill me.
They won't have any other choice.

01:37:45.494 --> 01:37:49.036
Otherwise I'm going to die by natural death.

01:37:52.116 --> 01:37:53.593
Honey! Where you going?

01:37:54.650 --> 01:37:58.541
- Well, well.
- I can't talk about anything in front of her.

01:37:59.728 --> 01:38:03.187
She would cut my balls.

01:38:15.318 --> 01:38:17.714
- What are you doing?
- I want to scatter the smoke.

01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:22.615
- It's bad for your health.
- Stop it! You think you'll get killed by cigars?

01:38:23.765 --> 01:38:24.773
You never know.

01:38:41.493 --> 01:38:52.230
- Tell me you're happy.
- I'd like to go away from here.

01:38:54.423 --> 01:38:58.873
We stay for a little while and
then we leave this country.

01:39:02.349 --> 01:39:08.081
Don't worry if we stay together,
nothing will happen to us.

01:39:10.483 --> 01:39:11.616
We love each other forever.

01:39:15.957 --> 01:39:17.122
You're my treasure.

01:39:20.024 --> 01:39:23.483
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:39:32.538 --> 01:39:33.911
That's Charly.

01:39:50.318 --> 01:39:55.425
- Do you know Dallier? Jacques Dallier?
- Fascist journalist.

01:39:56.523 --> 01:40:01.754
Corrupted journalist who works for
miniscule newspapers...

01:40:05.387 --> 01:40:08.846
Read it. Read!
Read it out loud!

01:40:10.601 --> 01:40:16.698
- "Mesrine, gangster without a bit of honor".
- He writes about me!

01:40:19.934 --> 01:40:25.249
"The kind who doesn't stand behind his word
and snitches on his friends".
Asshole!

01:40:28.954 --> 01:40:31.892
So what do you intend?

01:41:36.632 --> 01:41:37.797
Let's go.

01:42:38.262 --> 01:42:40.053
In the car! Get in the car!

01:42:44.363 --> 01:42:45.267
Charly!

01:43:01.204 --> 01:43:07.061
Reveal to me, your newspapers "Minute"
are they only for prisons with special regime?

01:43:07.357 --> 01:43:12.588
"Minute" are too extreme. As soon as i get the money for interview
i'll go to live on an island.

01:43:12.779 --> 01:43:17.177
An island?
And why not a french countryside?

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:26.593
French? Maybe when France was proud and respected...
But then, in 40's it surrendered to Hitler

01:43:27.170 --> 01:43:32.193
and 20 years later to strong Africa and Arabs too.

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.156
- So you think Algerie doesn't belong to algerians?
- And America belongs to indians?

01:43:38.119 --> 01:43:40.984
Who makes the country strong, savage or white man?

01:43:44.428 --> 01:43:51.902
- You used to be a cop. What do you think about them?
- They're idiots, bunch of scumbags.

01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:57.638
You should see how he crawls around you
big Jacques here, Mesrine there,

01:43:57.933 --> 01:43:59.410
despise them.

01:44:01.061 --> 01:44:06.084
In october of 1961 police was completely different.
Knew how to stand up to criminals.

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:15.310
But back then they had old Pape.
He was a powerful director.

01:44:19.936 --> 01:44:24.469
If it would be you i would take care of
Broussard. He intends something with your daughter.

01:44:26.089 --> 01:44:31.320
- That's true. And what plans they have regarding me?
- They want to kill you.

01:44:44.181 --> 01:44:45.398
I'm sure about that.

01:45:11.451 --> 01:45:12.407
Wait here!

01:45:45.968 --> 01:45:48.592
- Do you want a piece of gum?
- No.

01:46:08.492 --> 01:46:10.074
Kalashnikov is good weapon.

01:46:21.945 --> 01:46:22.901
- Dallier!
- Go.

01:46:26.533 --> 01:46:27.489
Here you go.

01:46:26.533 --> 01:46:27.489
Go!

01:46:44.834 --> 01:46:45.843
This way.

01:46:46.868 --> 01:46:50.639
Go, keep going! Quickly! Move!

01:47:07.498 --> 01:47:12.914
- You think he's capable of it?
- What do i know what these types are capable of?

01:47:18.256 --> 01:47:19.630
Do we start the interview?

01:47:24.826 --> 01:47:28.942
I will speak to Jacques Mesrine
who's ready to answer my questions.

01:47:30.822 --> 01:47:32.769
- Are you Jacques Mesrine?
- Maybe I am.

01:47:34.315 --> 01:47:35.376
So, you are Jacques Mesrine.

01:47:39.894 --> 01:47:44.031
I don't know what you have been told,
but you seem nervous.

01:47:44.952 --> 01:47:47.055
- Are you scared of something?
- It only seems to you.

01:47:50.896 --> 01:47:52.165
You're not comfortable.

01:47:57.361 --> 01:48:00.122
- I'm shocked.
- Why are you shocked?

01:48:00.386 --> 01:48:02.280
After all you came to do interview with me.

01:48:03.869 --> 01:48:05.826
Have you kidnapped Mr. Lelievre?

01:48:10.292 --> 01:48:14.377
- Put the microphone down.
- What's that?
- I told you to put the microphone down!

01:48:15.193 --> 01:48:19.070
Take all of your clothes off!
You want interview? We do it right now.

01:48:20.303 --> 01:48:23.867
But first we have to see you.
Let's go, get undressed! Take them off!

01:48:25.726 --> 01:48:28.069
So we see you came here
for an interview.

01:48:28.437 --> 01:48:32.345
Take them off! They could think you belong to us,
but you don't.

01:48:32.817 --> 01:48:35.264
- But you said that...
- Move!

01:48:32.817 --> 01:48:35.264
- You always need a material, aren't you?
- What do you mean?

01:48:42.776 --> 01:48:45.453
And then we put handcuffs.

01:48:46.165 --> 01:48:52.679
- And now, my dear... we'll play.
- Hands! Hands behind your back!

01:48:52.995 --> 01:48:55.286
- Mesrine, we are...
- Shut up! I'm talking now!

01:48:56.332 --> 01:48:57.966
- Listen to me...
- Shut up!

01:48:59.304 --> 01:49:04.046
I explain to you what we're going to do.
Dallier won't be doing the interview...

01:49:05.665 --> 01:49:11.106
...but Jacques Mesrine will ask the questions.
- Wait, don't do it!

01:49:20.056 --> 01:49:25.319
- What's your name?!   What?
- Your name!
- Jacques Dallier.

01:49:20.056 --> 01:49:25.319
Jacques Dallier. That's right, Dallier.
That's the name of this dirt!

01:49:28.764 --> 01:49:32.379
- Who do you work for? What cheap newspapers you work for?
- "Minute".

01:49:34.447 --> 01:49:39.397
- What?
- "Minute".
- Oh yes, for "Minute", the fascist newspapers.

01:49:43.311 --> 01:49:47.948
Did you write this? Did you write an article
about me? It is your article, isn't it?

01:49:48.212 --> 01:49:50.420
- That's not my article.
- I advise you, you better don't lie to me.

01:49:53.426 --> 01:49:57.333
That was you! You wrote the article!

01:50:01.768 --> 01:50:05.462
What? You wrote that i'm not honest
to my friends!

01:50:09.329 --> 01:50:12.350
I don't deal with my friends like that.
You tarnished me!

01:50:16.681 --> 01:50:20.244
My friend is here. Ask him if i'm honest man!

01:50:21.478 --> 01:50:22.851
If I'm honest!

01:50:24.606 --> 01:50:29.660
Journalists, who talk shit about me,
i break their neck! I break it!

01:50:43.272 --> 01:50:49.057
I show you how we used to do it in Algerie.
Look! You die, you asshole!

01:50:49.216 --> 01:50:52.811
That's enough. Stop!
Don't be a fascist like him!

01:50:54.013 --> 01:50:59.380
Stop!
If you want to, shoot him and let's end this.

01:50:59.382 --> 01:51:00.424
You right.

01:51:09.968 --> 01:51:12.176
Not necessary! We already made too much noise.

01:51:15.078 --> 01:51:16.243
Anyway he's dead.

01:51:27.070 --> 01:51:28.861
- You read the papers?
- Why?

01:51:30.199 --> 01:51:35.430
- That dick Dallier is alive. Would you believe it?
- He's alive? So? Only better.

01:51:35.621 --> 01:51:39.914
Better? What's so better about it? It's a disaster!
I told you not to send the photograph.

01:51:39.949 --> 01:51:42.209
Even journalists, your followers
are shocked!

01:51:43.755 --> 01:51:49.300
He wasn't even a reporter, just a regular snitch.

01:51:50.012 --> 01:51:57.329
Judge however you want. You pissed off
journalists! You attacked one of them!

01:51:57.416 --> 01:52:02.648
- Oh, one of them. So what? Just one.
- Read what the press is writing.

01:52:03.568 --> 01:52:09.113
From now on, my friend,
bear the repercussions yourself.

01:52:18.168 --> 01:52:23.608
Hi my love. If you're listening this cassette
my little Sylvia,

01:52:23.851 --> 01:52:30.699
i won't be here. It's only my voice,
my voice for your remembrance .

01:52:32.402 --> 01:52:36.122
That's the way it is my baby, your man is dead.
He was shot in barrage of police bullets.

01:52:37.981 --> 01:52:44.464
You know kitty, the man who chose
the life of war, robberies,

01:52:46.793 --> 01:52:48.635
won't die by a natural death.

01:52:51.538 --> 01:52:57.114
At the end, it's not important
if i died alone or in police fire.

01:52:57.690 --> 01:53:05.216
My death is like meaningless airplane catastrophy
or unfortunate coincidence.

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:10.639
You know, death doesn't even exist.

01:53:11.977 --> 01:53:14.633
Death doesn't mean anything for someone
who knew how to live.

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:20.024
I can say I didn't waste my life.

01:53:20.632 --> 01:53:26.177
A love for the law didn't work out,
but i had other love...

01:53:27.619 --> 01:53:29.931
...a love for woman, for you .

01:53:30.122 --> 01:53:33.716
I became a gangster.
That was my choice.

01:53:35.753 --> 01:53:39.316
I chose such life ,
an easy one, a criminal one,

01:53:40.132 --> 01:53:45.187
my victims have always been
or almost always been a filthy rich.

01:53:49.831 --> 01:53:53.529
After death i won't be guilty any more,
because i'll pay for everything.

01:53:54.315 --> 01:53:58.848
It's weird, people think of you as hero.

01:53:59.737 --> 01:54:03.092
but honestly, in the world of gangsters
heros don't exist.

01:54:03.491 --> 01:54:06.012
In this world there are only people,
who live outside of the law.

01:54:07.663 --> 01:54:11.122
I would die with gun in my hand even
if i couldn't use it.

01:54:11.834 --> 01:54:14.250
I can't know that, but i know this...

01:54:14.962 --> 01:54:20.507
If you're listening this cassette, i am in cell
i can't escape from.

01:54:22.262 --> 01:54:25.721
november 2nd, 1979.

01:54:31.126 --> 01:54:32.499
Your newspapers Robert.

01:54:36.965 --> 01:54:39.277
Barre pays off his last debt
to Robert Boulin

01:54:41.187 --> 01:54:44.701
Once again they're full of crap...

01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:47.518
Forget about it.

01:54:57.926 --> 01:54:59.091
Coming out! Coming out!

01:55:08.458 --> 01:55:11.636
Woman came out... with dog.

01:55:17.009 --> 01:55:20.155
She's  walking down on Billiar.
She's going towards Monceni.

01:55:23.631 --> 01:55:25.286
She'll show up in three seconds.

01:55:28.793 --> 01:55:30.584
This is Dom.
What's she doing?

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.714
She's looking around.

01:55:42.506 --> 01:55:45.006
A man is coming out of the building.
He's looking around.

01:56:03.831 --> 01:56:06.696
He's getting closer...
He's on Billiar.

01:56:28.963 --> 01:56:33.882
- What's he doing?
- He's heading toward Moncen.

01:56:39.391 --> 01:56:41.390
He's getting away from me. He's coming your way.

01:56:45.857 --> 01:56:48.398
Yeah, I see him, he's on Billiar.

01:56:55.033 --> 01:56:56.198
I lost him!

01:56:56.702 --> 01:56:58.941
Go? do you see him?

01:56:59.205 --> 01:57:01.621
I repeat , I don't know where he went.

01:57:05.044 --> 01:57:05.896
Damn!

01:57:12.031 --> 01:57:14.447
I see him.
He's walking slowly but not stopping.

01:57:23.815 --> 01:57:30.819
Shit! What am i going to do
if he'll find me here? Boss, what should i do?

01:57:30.906 --> 01:57:33.426
Relax G0? he won't notice anything.
- He's coming, He's coming

01:57:36.641 --> 01:57:39.162
He's looking at the truck.
He's getting closer!

01:57:39.457 --> 01:57:41.247
That's all. I'm turning it off!

01:57:43.315 --> 01:57:44.376
Go?

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:54.804
Go?

01:58:09.803 --> 01:58:10.655
Go?

01:58:41.713 --> 01:58:44.859
- I don't see them.
- What do you mean you don't see them?

01:58:45.988 --> 01:58:50.177
They were next to me, but i lost them.
Do you see them? I don't see them.

01:58:50.994 --> 01:58:52.471
Good, just calm down.

01:59:02.569 --> 01:59:04.672
I don't see anybody...
They just showed up!

01:59:09.868 --> 01:59:10.720
Idiot!

01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:17.499
I see Mesrine! He's with girl friend
in his BMW.

01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.896
83CSG75. I repeat...

01:59:33.957 --> 01:59:35.852
Go? he's backing up towards you.

01:59:52.519 --> 01:59:56.708
Copy. BMW is backing up towards me.

01:59:57.003 --> 01:59:57.960
It stopped.

02:00:01.175 --> 02:00:03.382
Both of them are getting out of the car,
she first.

02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:16.553
She went in the building.
He got out of the car.

02:00:19.632 --> 02:00:21.944
He's walking towards me.
- Calm, keep calm.

02:00:22.239 --> 02:00:24.134
He's coming towards me. He's coming towards me!
What should i do?

02:00:28.079 --> 02:00:29.869
Speak Ga? Do you copy?

02:00:37.464 --> 02:00:38.525
Ga?

02:01:01.449 --> 02:01:05.982
he was leaning on me.
I almost shit my pants. Shit!

02:01:06.976 --> 02:01:09.110
He's putting things in the trunk.

02:01:18.134 --> 02:01:19.716
She got in the car again.

02:01:26.685 --> 02:01:29.831
- They're going your way.
- I see them.

02:01:33.776 --> 02:01:35.149
We're moving towards Monceni.

02:01:37.843 --> 02:01:41.093
- In a few days I'll go to Milan to see Charly.
- Milan? What for?

02:01:41.284 --> 02:01:43.492
- I have to.
- Why?

02:01:43.995 --> 02:01:46.933
He wants to introduce me to his friends
from Red brigades.

02:01:47.332 --> 02:01:49.957
- Will you take me with you?
I can't. Maybe next time.

02:01:50.982 --> 02:01:53.920
BMW went by me.
Is going  by an average speed.

02:01:59.533 --> 02:02:05.005
- Don't be sad. You can furnish our new apartment,
while i'm away. - Not without you.

02:02:12.516 --> 02:02:18.217
- Suspect is standing three cars from me.
- All cars: Move towards Porte de Clignancourt.

02:02:25.812 --> 02:02:27.112
I'll be back soon.

02:02:33.529 --> 02:02:35.528
This is Dom. We're approaching Cornenau.

02:02:37.387 --> 02:02:39.699
- Do you love me?
- Sure.

02:02:51.924 --> 02:02:56.488
Suspect went on green light.
All units: The operation started!

02:03:01.893 --> 02:03:03.684
This is Ga?
I'm moving to Clignancourt.

02:03:34.742 --> 02:03:35.594
Shit!

02:03:37.557 --> 02:03:41.120
Did you know i was born just a half mile from here?

02:03:45.795 --> 02:03:47.169
BMW is approaching the square.

02:03:49.549 --> 02:03:50.819
BMW is arriving at square.

02:03:50.957 --> 02:03:51.966
Shit!

02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:31.905
Go ahead, go.

02:06:17.003 --> 02:06:24.007
Get out! Get out! I said get out!
Did you understand?!

02:06:24.719 --> 02:06:29.221
Let's go! Move, quickly!
Get on the ground! On the ground!

02:06:29.933 --> 02:06:35.478
- Lie down! Don't move. Stop twitching!
- You killed my dog!

02:06:48.078 --> 02:06:52.684
Hold her. Hold her!
Stop twitching!

02:07:18.737 --> 02:07:22.196
Dog is here.
Take him to a veterinarian.

02:07:23.534 --> 02:07:24.698
Seal it over here.

02:07:26.766 --> 02:07:28.244
Where did the truck go?

02:07:34.431 --> 02:07:37.629
It's over.
He's dead.

02:10:02.277 --> 02:10:08.017
- Hold her. Shut your mouth! Shut up!
- You killed my dog!
