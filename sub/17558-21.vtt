WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.003
This is the hardest decision
we've ever

00:03.037 --> 00:04.705
had to make as a couple.
I know.

00:04.738 --> 00:07.007
And even though I think
we're doing the right thing,

00:07.041 --> 00:09.377
I feel like there's a voice
in our head screaming,

00:09.410 --> 00:10.744
"You're making a mistake!"

00:10.778 --> 00:12.213
I know.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.215
But I've decided.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.552
We're going with
the blood orange citrus.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.853
Thank God.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.090
You know, I really
had my heart set
on the red velvet.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.257
Honey, no.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.592
Red velvet is such a trend cake.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.926
It'll feel like
a hipster wedding

00:25.959 --> 00:27.561
officiated by Mumford & Sons.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.996
Listen, guys...

00:29.029 --> 00:31.399
we still have over 900
wedding decisions to make,

00:31.432 --> 00:34.702
and so far, all you
agreed on is...

00:34.735 --> 00:36.104
well, nothing.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.371
I know.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.539
It's so hard
making decisions

00:38.572 --> 00:39.707
with someone
who's not me.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.275
Yeah, I mean,

00:41.309 --> 00:42.910
we had nine months
to come up with a baby name,

00:42.943 --> 00:44.078
and we're not
even close.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.746
Look, guys, my wife and I,

00:45.779 --> 00:46.747
we've been through this.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.749
We have named
16 kids together.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.918
Luis, Luis Jr.,

00:50.951 --> 00:52.853
Little Luis, Wide Luis.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.788
But what I
learned is that

00:54.822 --> 00:56.190
if you can learn
to compromise

00:56.224 --> 00:58.058
in the little
things-- like cake--

00:58.092 --> 01:01.028
then you can move on
to the bigger issues

01:01.061 --> 01:02.963
like baby names.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.398
Why don't you start
with something simple?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.500
Like candles.

01:08.136 --> 01:10.271
Mm, these brown sugar
scented candles

01:10.304 --> 01:11.772
smell so delicious.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.974
Thank you for letting me
have them at the wedding.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.210
Well, you did
let me choose my
blood orange cake,

01:16.244 --> 01:17.745
even though I
did change it

01:17.778 --> 01:19.079
to burnt almond meringue

01:19.113 --> 01:21.215
after Guy Fieri ruined
citrus for us all.
Yeah.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.417
So...

01:23.451 --> 01:24.918
there is
something

01:24.952 --> 01:27.221
that I would like
at our wedding

01:27.255 --> 01:28.922
that I've been a little
scared to ask for.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.658
No, you cannot do
your Gollum impression

01:30.691 --> 01:31.825
when you put the ring

01:31.859 --> 01:33.894
on my finger.
No.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.263
(sighs)

01:35.296 --> 01:37.665
I was wondering how you felt
about inviting your mother.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.001
I feel...

01:41.034 --> 01:43.271
(screams, sobs):
No! No! No!

01:43.304 --> 01:44.805
Oh, my God. (sobs)

01:44.838 --> 01:46.974
...conflicted?

01:47.007 --> 01:49.310
Look, I know it's
been a little chilly
between you two,

01:49.343 --> 01:51.245
but you were
working on it,

01:51.279 --> 01:53.181
you opened a dialogue,
it's starting to thaw.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.582
Don't you think
she should be here?

01:54.615 --> 01:58.186
David, I want our wedding day
to be about positivity,

01:58.219 --> 02:00.788
and love, and rented
trumpeter swans,

02:00.821 --> 02:03.023
and not any kind of tensions
between my mother and I.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.825
Okay, but she's your mom.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.827
Why would I want to share
our wedding day--

02:06.860 --> 02:07.928
our perfect day

02:07.961 --> 02:09.497
to celebrate our love--

02:09.530 --> 02:10.698
with her?

02:10.731 --> 02:13.667
Because your love wants you to.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.106
Fine.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.175
Yeah?

02:21.209 --> 02:22.976
But you have to agree:
no pretzel bread.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.145
Agreed. Now...

02:25.179 --> 02:29.350
(imitating Gollum):
Give me a kiss, my precious.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.685
You were so close
to getting some.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.690
What's it gonna be,
what's it gonna be?

02:36.724 --> 02:38.492
I know!

02:38.526 --> 02:40.127
Oh...
Oh...

02:40.160 --> 02:42.796
It's our baby's
ultrasound picture.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.398
He looks like a
potato with a face.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.867
Thank God he didn't
get your nose.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.035
Thank you so
much, Goldie.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.870
You can put it
on the bedside table

02:49.903 --> 02:51.239
next to that picture
of your mom,

02:51.272 --> 02:53.574
who I'm very excited
to meet, by the way.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.809
Oh, no, honey, that's a picture
of Meg Ryan, before...

02:55.843 --> 02:57.878
whatever the hell
happened there. (chuckles)

02:57.911 --> 02:59.313
No, but you can meet Colleen.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.648
Why don't you come to dinner?
Oh, we'd
love to.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.483
Yeah. Rocky,
do you want to come, too?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.352
Thank you, but I've met
your mom, so I'll pass.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.853
But I'll take home
an expensive

03:05.886 --> 03:08.322
bottle of red to make up
for what I would have drank.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.557
(laughs)

03:09.590 --> 03:11.091
Well, Shania and I
would love to attend.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.394
Besides, it's important that
your mom meets Mr. Thingmeum.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.062
Have you decided on a name yet?

03:15.095 --> 03:16.897
Oh, uh...

03:16.930 --> 03:19.867
Bryan and I are trying to avoid
the issue while Colleen is here.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.669
BRYAN:
It's important
that she sees

03:21.702 --> 03:23.404
that David and I are on
the same page about things.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.072
Like she and
my dad were.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.741
And the baby name
is a bit of a...

03:27.775 --> 03:30.010
as they say on The View,
a "hot flash topic."

03:30.043 --> 03:31.345
That's not what they say.
Well, they should.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.514
Your child's name should be

03:33.547 --> 03:34.682
a source of conflict.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.049
My parents
named me

03:36.083 --> 03:37.918
Rocky Rhoades.
A little black girl

03:37.951 --> 03:39.953
named after
lumpy ice cream?

03:39.987 --> 03:42.055
I had to fight for my life
on the playground.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.724
Shank or be shanked.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.125
I'm talking prison rules, baby.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.126
It was rough.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.595
Mom?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.930
Did you and Dad argue
about what my name would be?

03:49.963 --> 03:53.066
Um... actually, no,
we pretty much agreed.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.402
(toilet flushes)
* That don't impress me
much... *

03:54.435 --> 03:55.869
Oh, my God, I don't know
what it is about

03:55.903 --> 03:57.438
Shania playing in the
toilet stall, but,

03:57.471 --> 03:59.273
oh, baby, I'm
so horny.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.409
Oh. Wait! Go to the
family planning aisle

04:01.442 --> 04:02.576
and steal some condoms.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.811
What?

04:03.844 --> 04:05.446
No, there's no time.
The song's almost over.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.714
(toilet flushes)
Mm!

04:06.747 --> 04:08.649
That's how I
got my name?

04:08.682 --> 04:09.983
What? It was a loving moment

04:10.017 --> 04:12.119
between me and your dad.
A few minutes

04:12.152 --> 04:13.654
later, and your name
would have been Chumbawamba.

04:13.687 --> 04:17.090
(laughing)

04:17.124 --> 04:18.258
DAVID:
That is a great band.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.293
How could you joke about this?

04:19.327 --> 04:21.329
A name determines
your destiny.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.896
And now I'm
stuck for life

04:22.930 --> 04:24.965
with the choice you made
to a soundtrack of

04:24.998 --> 04:27.468
Canadian pop country
and auto-flushes?

04:27.501 --> 04:28.836
Well, that don't
impress me much.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.339
Oh, you... Shania.
Help me up.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.773
Yeah. Yeah.
You keep
that up,

04:32.806 --> 04:34.308
and no Nancy Grace
for a week!

04:34.342 --> 04:35.943
(door closes)

04:35.976 --> 04:37.911
My God. If we named
our child after

04:37.945 --> 04:39.313
the song that was playing
when we first hooked up,

04:39.347 --> 04:40.681
his name would be
Hoobastank.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.282
BRYAN:
Hoobastank.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.417
I like that name.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.985
Hoobastank Collins.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.988
Hmm, white people have
the craziest names for bands.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.858
Hey, guys.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.626
Whoa, no dessert
before dinner, Shania.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.162
I'm not Shania.
I'm changing my name to Sarah.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.797
What are you
talking about, monkey?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.932
For the past ten years,

04:58.966 --> 05:01.134
I've been saddled with
your oddball name of Shania,

05:01.168 --> 05:03.270
the name that you
arbitrarily chose

05:03.303 --> 05:05.105
because of the random song
that was playing

05:05.138 --> 05:06.674
while you were having
premarital relations

05:06.707 --> 05:08.108
in a pharmacy.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.010
Oh, yeah!

05:10.043 --> 05:12.346
That was you.
(fake laughs)

05:12.380 --> 05:14.782
There are five girls
in my class named Sarah.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.450
I just want to be one of them.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.152
Your mom and I agreed
on that name. Together.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.788
And you are not changing it.
Case closed.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.623
I don't think
it's a big deal, Clay.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.958
Let her call herself
Sarah if she wants.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.327
Case reopened.
Sarah's awesome mom

05:27.361 --> 05:30.097
gets a bigger vote
than Shania's inflexible dad.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.733
Whoa, Shania...

05:32.766 --> 05:33.801
(door closes)

05:33.834 --> 05:34.968
How could you
do that to me?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.537
In front of
our daughter.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.806
You know, now she
thinks we're not
a united front.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.674
This whole Sarah thing
will blow over.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.510
Last weekend,
she was the Hamburglar.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.711
(laughing):
I mean...

05:43.744 --> 05:45.045
Sorry. I-I just don't think

05:45.078 --> 05:46.213
that names matter that much.

05:46.246 --> 05:48.516
Although...

05:48.549 --> 05:50.884
I've been thinking
about my name, too.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.086
I've been through so many
changes this year.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.354
So I'm gonna drop Clemmons

05:54.388 --> 05:55.856
and go back to
my maiden name, Forrest.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.925
No. Y-You can't do that.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.226
It's not a big deal, Clay.
No.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.360
It's the biggest deal.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.095
We may not
live together,

06:02.129 --> 06:04.765
Goldie, but the fact that
we share the same last name,

06:04.798 --> 06:05.966
it says we're a family.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.037
(sighs)

06:10.070 --> 06:12.740
Bryan, that getup
you're wearing.

06:12.773 --> 06:13.741
Y-You look like...

06:13.774 --> 06:15.275
Like a gay
yacht captain?

06:15.308 --> 06:17.878
When you say it,
it's a lot less fun.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.613
(chuckles)
DAVID:
Now, Colleen,

06:19.647 --> 06:21.949
when was the last time
we saw each other?

06:21.982 --> 06:23.751
Dad's funeral.
Dad's funeral.
Oh.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.253
Oh, that was a tough day
for everyone.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.088
Especially your father, right?

06:28.121 --> 06:30.090
(chuckles)

06:30.123 --> 06:32.726
I absolutely
love your home.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.894
Oh.
Oh.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.029
It's like the palace
of a tasteful dictator.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.631
Thank you, Mother, it is.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.867
It will be the perfect place
to raise our child.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.068
Speaking of,
I was hoping

06:41.101 --> 06:42.402
maybe that you would whisper

06:42.436 --> 06:43.637
the name of my grandson to me.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.138
Oh, well, actually,
we're still sort of

06:45.172 --> 06:46.474
kicking the tires on
a few options, there.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.841
You haven't decided yet?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.911
He could arrive at any time.
(sighs)

06:50.944 --> 06:52.846
Okay, just give me
a few names you agree on.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.818
Okay. Uh, well,

06:57.851 --> 06:59.753
I would like to name him
after my grandpa.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.822
He was the best.
Oh...

07:01.855 --> 07:04.057
Yeah, he was a bit of
a moist kisser,

07:04.091 --> 07:05.959
but he made
one hell of an omelet.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.829
His name was Julius,
but everyone called him Julie.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.931
Julie--
the male offspring

07:10.964 --> 07:12.265
of two homosexuals.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.467
I can't imagine

07:13.501 --> 07:15.102
any angry therapy sessions
in his future.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.403
Don't make fun, Bryan.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.839
Obviously David
was very fond

07:18.872 --> 07:20.440
of his grandfather,
and I think

07:20.474 --> 07:22.142
Julius is a very nice name.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.176
Well, thank you, Colleen.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.812
What do you think of...

07:24.845 --> 07:26.146
Thomas?

07:26.179 --> 07:27.581
Mm.
Hmm? Right?

07:27.615 --> 07:28.816
It's the name
of a president,

07:28.849 --> 07:30.017
an apostle.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.985
An English muffin
with nooks and crannies.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.287
And if Bryan gets his way,

07:34.321 --> 07:36.323
then your baby's name
will be Tom Sawyer.

07:36.356 --> 07:37.991
(laughs)

07:38.025 --> 07:39.292
Wait, why would you assume

07:39.326 --> 07:40.427
we're using David's last name?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.995
Well, David's the donor.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.463
Is that not "the way"?

07:43.497 --> 07:44.698
DAVID:
And, Bryan,
if we use your last name,

07:44.732 --> 07:46.767
his name would be Tom Collins.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.836
(laughing)

07:48.869 --> 07:50.504
Oh, no. He'll be teased by

07:50.538 --> 07:53.273
all the 55-year-old mortgage
brokers at the airport bar.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.176
Boys, I don't want
to start any chaos.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.811
Mother, what-what chaos?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.012
This is
not chaos.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.614
David and I agree
on everything else.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.449
Oh, it's true.
We've planned our entire wedding

08:02.482 --> 08:03.884
with not so much
as a speed bump.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.853
You know, actually, we are going
over the final details

08:05.886 --> 08:07.454
with the wedding
planner tomorrow.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.989
Why don't you come with us,

08:09.022 --> 08:11.291
and you can see all the
decisions we agreed on.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.392
I would love to.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.994
Because I really want
to see that,

08:14.027 --> 08:16.697
you two boys on
the same page together.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.666
I mean, are you even sure
you're both gay?

08:18.699 --> 08:20.067
Well, if we're not,
we did something

08:20.100 --> 08:22.102
really weird last night.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.074
(laughs nervously)

08:33.113 --> 08:34.181
Okay.
Here's your flower choice.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.016
Perfect.
Love 'em.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.751
Centerpieces.
Fantastic.
Stunning.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.753
And napkin rings.
Our napkins will look

08:39.787 --> 08:41.822
so gorgeous
in those things.
So round.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.591
It's so nice to see you boys
finally in agreement.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.059
LUIS:
And here is your choice of cake.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.861
A burnt almond meringue.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.096
"Burnt almond"?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.330
It sounds...

08:50.363 --> 08:52.232
well, let's face it,
it sounds burnt.

08:52.265 --> 08:55.102
Which is historically a sign
of failure in cake.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.504
I actually wanted a red velvet,
but Bryan insisted.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.239
I just feel very
strongly about this.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.273
Red velvet is passé.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.710
Is it passé, or is it perennial?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.578
Plantation owners
used to eat it

09:04.612 --> 09:05.879
in the antebellum South.

09:05.913 --> 09:06.947
So I'm supposed to serve

09:06.980 --> 09:08.081
a racist cake at my wedding?

09:08.115 --> 09:10.250
Bryan does know about
this stuff.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.620
All I'm saying is,
I respect and appreciate

09:12.653 --> 09:14.087
your partner's choice.
So do I.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.789
Well, red velvet it is, then.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.692
David, what else did
Bryan say no to?

09:18.726 --> 09:20.393
Oh... um...
Come on, show me.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.366
This was my nightmare.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.635
I literally had a bad dream

09:27.668 --> 09:29.302
that my mother did nothing
but undermine me

09:29.336 --> 09:30.570
and pit us against
each other.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.873
Except in my dream,
you were as tall as me.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.541
I think
you're overreacting, Bry.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.209
Of course you do.
You know why?

09:36.243 --> 09:38.111
Because she's siding with you
and not me.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.813
About cake?

09:39.847 --> 09:41.715
Who cares? It's not important.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.150
Well, it's not
when you haven't had

09:43.183 --> 09:44.652
to deal with it
your entire life.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.654
Do you really think
my mother wanted

09:46.687 --> 09:48.622
to watch Baywatch Nights
like my little brothers?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.991
No. She just did it because
she knew I didn't want to.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.060
This is exactly
why I didn't want
to invite her.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.261
Because at a time

09:54.294 --> 09:55.629
where it is crucial
for us to be

09:55.663 --> 09:57.397
on the same page, she is turning
us against each other.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.100
Okay. That is not possible.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.736
I don't care
about soup spoons

10:02.770 --> 10:04.672
and gluten-free
boutonnieres.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.741
I care about marrying you.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.743
For all I'm concerned, we could
throw all of our choices

10:09.777 --> 10:11.311
in a hat
and draw 'em at random.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.582
We could make a game out of it.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.685
We could do it right
in front of her,

10:17.718 --> 10:19.119
at dinner with
Goldie and Shania.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.254
But not Rocky, who swiped
not one but two bottles

10:21.288 --> 10:22.455
of our good Merlot.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.425
Show your mom that nothing
can come between us.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.360
And you'll be okay with the
results, no matter what happens?

10:27.394 --> 10:29.262
Yes.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.998
Just no more disagreements.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.700
Agreed.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.934
Oh!
BRYAN:
Mm-hmm.

10:33.967 --> 10:34.968
We are ready!

10:35.002 --> 10:36.837
Yay! What are
we doing?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.972
Oh, yeah. Well, Bryan and I
just want to settle

10:39.006 --> 10:40.140
on a couple of our
wedding decisions.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.876
Oh, you boys must
really be at odds.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.445
No, Mother. Actually,
we are incredibly in sync.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.780
So much so that we have agreed

10:46.814 --> 10:48.281
to let the hat decide.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.550
Well, I wish I had
that kind of free time.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.485
DAVID:
Okay...

10:52.519 --> 10:54.187
Let the
games begin.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.288
(whoops)
Okay, Shania,

10:55.322 --> 10:56.690
would you like to do the honors?

10:56.724 --> 11:00.193
Sorry. Sarah is
nonparticipatory.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.464
Okay. Uh, first category is

11:04.497 --> 11:07.134
beverage service, okay.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.170
There will be two choices--
one is mine, one is Bryan's.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.973
They will go into the hat--
mix it up, please.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.108
And the winner is...

11:16.844 --> 11:18.545
Oh, my God, it's mine--
Scott's microbrewery.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.213
(Goldie and Colleen cheering)

11:20.247 --> 11:21.815
Sorry, baby.
No, no.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.183
Listen, for our ten-year
vow renewal,

11:23.216 --> 11:25.152
you'll do your mint
mixology station.
Amazing.

11:25.185 --> 11:29.389
The official floral
centerpiece choice is...

11:29.422 --> 11:31.258
Succulent desert cacti.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.861
Yay for David.
Yes!
GOLDIE: Arriba.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.595
Law of averages says
you'll win the next one.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.931
Our first dance
will be to...

11:37.965 --> 11:41.001
"I Only Wanna Be With You"
by Hootie & the Blowfish.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.703
(whoops)
Love Hootie.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.672
Oh, I don't like rap music.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.040
Riblets.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.942
Karaoke guestbook?

11:48.976 --> 11:50.243
People love that.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.512
Oh, I admire one's ability

11:52.545 --> 11:54.948
to cut loose
and sing like fools.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.317
Bryan, you made a whole
TV program about it.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.121
Gyros.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.522
Ooh, delicious.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.257
Are you even putting mine in?

12:05.292 --> 12:06.659
Tiki torches.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.196
Festive.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.364
Valets dressed
as Sith Lords.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.599
Oh, Shania.

12:12.632 --> 12:13.867
Sarah.
Sarah!

12:13.901 --> 12:15.368
Zoom, zoom!

12:15.402 --> 12:17.370
And last but
not least,

12:17.404 --> 12:20.707
the mode of transportation
that will whisk the groom

12:20.740 --> 12:21.875
and the groom

12:21.909 --> 12:24.377
from the festivities will be...

12:24.411 --> 12:26.046
Drumroll.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.148
Segways-- yes!

12:28.181 --> 12:30.050
What are those?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.652
Eat my dust. Eat my dust.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.454
I cannot believe
I won, like,

12:34.487 --> 12:36.289
every category. Yes!

12:36.323 --> 12:37.624
Hey, I've got a great idea

12:37.657 --> 12:38.959
if you want to settle
the name fight.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.228
It's not a fight, Mother.
Let the hat decide.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.230
Oh... I don't
know about that.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.232
Oh, come on,
it sounds like fun, right?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.733
Yeah, I don't think...

12:46.766 --> 12:48.735
This is happening.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.403
Uh...

12:50.437 --> 12:51.638
uh...

12:51.671 --> 12:53.907
Bryan, why don't we just go
in the other room

12:53.941 --> 12:55.642
and talk... are you gonna
write my name, okay.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.910
Sweetie, we don't have...
It's fine, it's fine,

12:56.944 --> 13:00.113
it's fine, it's fine,
it's fine.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.248
(Colleen gasps)

13:01.281 --> 13:03.016
Which will it be,

13:03.050 --> 13:04.584
Thomas or Julie?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.086
Oh, I'm so excited!

13:06.119 --> 13:07.888
I can't wait to hear
my grandson's name.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.757
Ready?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.760
(slow, rhythmic heart beating)

13:13.793 --> 13:15.462
(slow breathing)

13:25.805 --> 13:29.676
(slowly, distorted):
Julie.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.380
Yes! Julie Sawyer lives!

13:33.413 --> 13:36.449
Julie Sawyer lives,
oh, my God.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.218
You wet-kissing, waffle-flipping
son of a bitch!

13:38.251 --> 13:40.620
Julie Sawyer's alive again.
Oh, congratulations.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.857
COLLEEN: Hey, that's so
good, oh, I'm so...

13:43.891 --> 13:46.326
No!

13:47.660 --> 13:49.662
I don't give a damn
what this paper says.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.631
I can, I can let go
of a lot of things, okay?

13:51.664 --> 13:55.368
Riblets, gyros,
Hootie & the Blowfishes.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.305
Because at the end of the day
all those idiotic choices

13:58.338 --> 13:59.739
are insignificant.

13:59.772 --> 14:03.376
But under no circumstance
will my son be named Julie!

14:03.410 --> 14:04.744
Game over.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.547
Unless you disagree, Mother.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.218
Well, I certainly
never raised him

14:11.251 --> 14:13.053
to be such a poor sport.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.560
(knocks)
Mother?

14:20.593 --> 14:23.163
Oh, the sheets are
very scratchy.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.432
Do you have anything
a little less organic?

14:25.465 --> 14:27.100
Yeah, I'll just run down
to the 7-Eleven.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.501
Mother, we need to talk.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.771
Oh, honey, you don't have
to apologize for your outburst.

14:31.804 --> 14:34.774
Planning a wedding is
a very stressful time.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.777
I know because I watch a lot
of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.179
Okay, well,
that is a great show.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.513
But, no, I'm not apologizing.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.915
If anything, you should.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.251
What do I have
to be sorry about?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.386
The fact that
you don't know what...

14:46.419 --> 14:48.188
what deserves an apology,

14:48.221 --> 14:49.856
that deserves
an apology.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.858
Just forget it, I knew...

14:51.891 --> 14:53.360
I knew this would happen
if invited you.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.129
You weren't gonna invite me
to your wedding?

14:56.163 --> 14:58.932
No.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.367
No, I wasn't.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.802
'Cause I don't want
to deal with this.

15:02.835 --> 15:06.473
I tried with you
my very best, Bryan.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.042
I am sorry
if you judge me for it.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.610
Me?

15:10.643 --> 15:12.379
All you do is judge me.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.214
You make fun
of the way I dress.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.616
You-you criticize
my work, my sheets.

15:16.649 --> 15:20.287
Y-You like David's baby name
choice better than mine.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.888
And look, I know you had
six kids to raise,

15:21.921 --> 15:24.424
but you could have tried a
little bit harder to disguise

15:24.457 --> 15:26.393
the fact that you loved me
less than the others.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.395
You exhaust me, Bryan.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.797
I-I can't win.

15:30.830 --> 15:34.734
I come here to your wedding
to a man.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.304
A man you're gonna
start a family with.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.307
My friends make comments.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.075
"I'm happy for them," I say.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.278
"I-I'm so glad he found
a good person," I say.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.680
"I was worried for a
while, but I'm not now.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.650
I can't wait to hold
my grandson," I say.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.586
And then I come here

15:53.620 --> 15:55.922
and share my
opinion about cake,

15:55.955 --> 15:58.025
and you still see
me as the mother

15:58.058 --> 16:00.793
who spanked you for
stealing her good lipstick?

16:02.996 --> 16:04.998
You're still so hurt, Bryan,

16:05.032 --> 16:07.134
and I can't fix the past.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.703
You're gonna be a father now.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.907
Isn't it time for
you to grow up?

16:18.378 --> 16:19.712
Yes.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.519
Thank you for coming, Mom.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.588
Thank you for
asking me, Bryan.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.794
Oh, God, it's just so hard
to have big opinions.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.164
I'm right almost all
the time and I have

16:37.197 --> 16:40.633
no patience for
the slow-witted.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.303
It makes people
feel very small.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.305
I wouldn't recommend it.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.307
I know, it's maddening.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.708
I lived with you for 18 years.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.210
(laughs)

16:50.243 --> 16:52.145
And Bryan,

16:52.179 --> 16:55.248
David has lived
with you for eight,

16:55.282 --> 16:58.585
and is signing up
for a lifetime.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.920
Give in on the little things,
sweetheart.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.124
I never did.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.761
Now, about that baby's name.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.564
There will be a moment

17:11.598 --> 17:14.401
when you will just know
what his name should be.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.104
Be patient. It'll happen.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.406
It happened on every
single one of my kids,

17:19.439 --> 17:21.341
except for your sister.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.444
In my defense, I was on a
few diet pills at the time.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.179
Poor Marva.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.914
I know.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.283
(laughs)

17:30.317 --> 17:31.518
I know.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.353
(both laughing)

17:33.386 --> 17:35.388
(school bell rings)

17:35.422 --> 17:36.789
How was school,

17:36.823 --> 17:37.890
Sarah?

17:37.924 --> 17:38.925
Did you learn fractions?

17:38.958 --> 17:40.860
My name's not Sarah anymore.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.229
I'm going back to Shania.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.298
Something happened today
that changed my mind.

17:50.970 --> 17:51.804
What are you doing?

17:51.838 --> 17:53.206
What does it look like?

17:53.240 --> 17:56.075
I'm building a log cabin
out of fish sticks.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.077
I'm Sarah. What's your name?

17:58.111 --> 17:59.112
Blog.

17:59.146 --> 17:59.912
What?

17:59.946 --> 18:01.080
It's a pretty weird name,

18:01.114 --> 18:03.049
but I've never met
anyone else with it,

18:03.082 --> 18:04.050
so I love it.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.452
Well, Blog fits you.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.986
To be honest,

18:07.019 --> 18:08.388
my real name is Shania.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.423
Some lady singer
named Shania was

18:10.457 --> 18:13.593
on the radio in the drugstore
toilet where my parents made me.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.762
Gross story.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.798
But cool name.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.233
A name defines you

18:20.267 --> 18:21.834
before you have a chance

18:21.868 --> 18:23.069
to do it yourself.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.771
Sometimes being unique
is exhausting,

18:24.804 --> 18:25.838
but it's who I am.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.807
Thanks for the cool name, Dad.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.811
Did you know that your mom's
going back to her maiden name?

18:31.844 --> 18:34.181
It's... it's like
she's saying that

18:34.214 --> 18:36.082
we were never married.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.317
It makes me super sad.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.985
You should tell her
how you feel.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.820
Maybe I will, Sarah.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.755
Shania.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.625
It's gonna be hard
to get used to.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.897
David?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.300
I don't want you

18:53.333 --> 18:54.967
to give up everything
that you want.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.303
Our wedding
day should be

18:56.336 --> 18:57.937
a reflection of both
of our opinions.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.539
But you hate all my ideas.

18:59.572 --> 19:04.076
Actually, there's one
that I really love.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.881
(Hootie & The Blowfish's
"Only Wanna Be With You" plays)

19:08.915 --> 19:11.851
Oh, seriously?

19:11.884 --> 19:14.287
You're okay with this song
being our first dance?

19:14.321 --> 19:15.955
Oh, my God, no,
no, it's the worst.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.292
No, we're just dancing now
to get it out of your system.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.728
(both laugh)

19:21.761 --> 19:25.298
No, the idea that I love,
that I want to thank you for

19:25.332 --> 19:29.168
is pushing me to invite
my mom to our wedding.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.070
She actually gave me

19:31.103 --> 19:33.005
some really great advice
about picking a baby name.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.541
Oh, yeah? What was that?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.008
To not stress about it.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.611
That when the time was
right, we would just know.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.515
It's so good. Come on.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.351
You really like
this, don't you?
Mm-hmm.

19:44.384 --> 19:47.053
Oh...

19:47.086 --> 19:49.889
* I'm gonna pout at you
until I get my way *

19:49.922 --> 19:52.359
BOTH:
"Sawyer Collins."

19:52.392 --> 19:53.760
* I won't dance...

19:53.793 --> 19:55.762
Oh, my God,
I love it.
It's perfect.

19:55.795 --> 19:59.332
* I just want to love you,
but you want to wear my ring *

19:59.366 --> 20:01.501
* But there's nothing I can do

20:01.534 --> 20:03.102
Oh!
Yes!

20:03.135 --> 20:04.404
It was the song.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.873
* I only wanna be with you.
(laughter)

20:13.580 --> 20:15.615
Whoa!
Oh!

20:15.648 --> 20:17.717
It was really sweet of
you to suggest this.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.919
The girls are having
so much fun. (laughs)

20:19.952 --> 20:21.588
Goldie?

20:21.621 --> 20:23.290
Do you remember the last time

20:23.323 --> 20:25.792
we were at a bowling alley
together?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.794
Yes, Yes, I'll marry you.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.563
For better or worse. (whoops)

20:31.631 --> 20:33.733
Of course.

20:33.766 --> 20:37.136
It's different, though.
I mean, we are a lot different.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.971
Yeah. (laughs)
Yeah.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.908
Huh.
Oh.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.076
Okay.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.480
One thing hasn't changed.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.618
I love you,
and I don't care

20:51.651 --> 20:54.421
if your name is Goldie Forrest
or Clemmons.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.556
Hell, I'd change my name
to Clay Forrest

20:56.589 --> 20:58.925
if it means
I get to spend the rest

20:58.958 --> 21:00.259
of my life with you.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.995
Goldie...

21:03.029 --> 21:05.097
will you remarry me?
