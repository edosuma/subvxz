There you go.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.094
-Liver and beans again?
-It's all we had.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.358
You've done it again, honey.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.231
Jamie, I'm sorry
if you don't like it,

00:14.318 --> 00:15.798
but I worked very hard
to make this,

00:15.885 --> 00:18.105
and nobody leaves
until their plates are clean.

01:10.983 --> 01:13.899
What's the number again?

01:13.986 --> 01:17.207
Great. I got it.
I'll call you, I promise.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.426
If that wasn't
a relative,

01:18.513 --> 01:19.775
I'm going
to be very upset.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.298
It's just another
college recruiter.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.431
Just another
college recruiter?

01:23.518 --> 01:24.823
You know, when I
was applying,

01:24.910 --> 01:26.390
believe me, there
were no recruiters.

01:26.477 --> 01:28.871
If I hadn't found that ad
inside that matchbook,

01:28.958 --> 01:31.308
I may not have pursued
higher education at all.

01:31.395 --> 01:33.223
But they're calling me
all the time.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.659
I must get ten calls a day.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.226
Then each one
must be handled

01:36.313 --> 01:38.272
like that's the university
you're going to.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.187
It's called options.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.971
Why do you think
guys date ugly women?

01:42.058 --> 01:44.887
LOIS:
I swear I will kill my mother!

01:44.974 --> 01:47.150
She just slinks down here
and marries off my son

01:47.237 --> 01:50.719
to some Eastern European bimbo,
the old reptile.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.721
I can't believe
her leg hasn't grown back.

01:52.808 --> 01:53.852
Honey, calm down.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.593
No. I am going to kill her.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.943
You know, if a young person
dies, it looks suspicious.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.075
When old people die,

01:59.162 --> 02:00.685
it's just the way of the world.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.122
There's no investigation.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.862
Well, at least Reese
is independent now.

02:03.949 --> 02:05.037
Independent?!
He's living in our garage!

02:05.125 --> 02:06.735
How independent is that?

02:06.822 --> 02:08.866
I read about this old woman
who drowned in her bowl of soup.

02:08.954 --> 02:09.955
It happens.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.261
Honey, look at the up side.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.220
Malcolm is going off
to college,

02:13.307 --> 02:14.438
Francis is with Piama,

02:14.525 --> 02:16.005
now Reese is married.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.007
They've all flown the nest.

02:18.094 --> 02:19.226
We're done.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.488
We still have Jamie and Dewey.

02:20.575 --> 02:22.490
Oh! Right.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.361
I'm all packed up.

02:24.448 --> 02:25.754
Good for you.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.495
Are you going somewhere?

02:27.582 --> 02:30.062
He's going to Francis's.
Let's go over the rules again.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.369
When you are on a bus,
what are you to do?

02:32.456 --> 02:34.676
Talk to no one,
don't let anyone sit next to me,

02:34.763 --> 02:36.504
try to look sickly
and learning-impaired,

02:36.591 --> 02:39.159
cough every few minutes
and nose-picking's okay.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.725
Encouraged.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.292
And what if you are on the bus
for a few hours

02:42.379 --> 02:44.076
and you have to go to
the bathroom really, really bad?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.557
-I still don't go.
-That's my boy.

02:48.907 --> 02:51.083
Mom, Dad, I would like
to invite you

02:51.171 --> 02:52.563
to a garage-warming.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.217
Raduca thought that
the least we could do

02:54.304 --> 02:56.741
is show our appreciation
by treating you to a meal.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.482
Well, I don't know
what to say.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.702
We would be delighted to come.
What are we having?

03:00.789 --> 03:04.575
Looks like baloney,
some kind of yellow cheese,

03:04.662 --> 03:09.580
half a liter of diet soda
and Wheat Crisps.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.495
Wonderful.

03:13.454 --> 03:15.064
Huh?

03:15.151 --> 03:16.457
This is where you live?

03:16.544 --> 03:17.501
Yeah.

03:17.588 --> 03:18.589
Where's Piama?

03:18.676 --> 03:20.069
Her sister's in prison.

03:20.156 --> 03:23.115
Or marrying somebody in prison.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.465
Whatever it was,
she bought a dress.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.293
So what's the deal
with the beard?

03:26.380 --> 03:28.425
Oh, this thing? I don't know.

03:28.512 --> 03:29.600
I was trying to
find a job

03:29.687 --> 03:31.254
and not really
finding anything

03:31.341 --> 03:33.474
and kinda felt like
something was holding me back.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.389
I think this makes me stand out
from the crowd.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.434
Mission accomplished.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.610
So this is how you live?

03:39.697 --> 03:42.352
No fridge, no real furniture,

03:42.439 --> 03:44.920
and the only decoration's
a stolen bus bench?

03:45.007 --> 03:46.487
Isn't that great?

03:46.574 --> 03:50.142
Francis, this is...
everything I've ever dreamed of!

03:50.230 --> 03:51.187
This is exactly

03:51.274 --> 03:52.754
how I'll live when I grow up!

03:52.841 --> 03:53.798
Thanks, Dewey.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.060
You know, it's not easy

03:55.147 --> 03:56.758
to create this
kind of lifestyle.

03:56.845 --> 03:57.715
Hey, you want to
listen to some music?

03:57.802 --> 03:58.847
Sure.

04:00.892 --> 04:05.201
Hey, Kipler,
turn that crap down!

04:05.288 --> 04:07.769
[ music gets louder]

04:07.856 --> 04:08.987
[ shouting]:
Feel that bass?

04:09.074 --> 04:10.902
That's a powered subwoofer!

04:12.077 --> 04:13.340
I'm not going to be mean.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.037
I'm going
to very nicely tell them

04:15.124 --> 04:16.690
that their marriage is a sham
and must be dissolved.

04:16.778 --> 04:17.779
That might backfire.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.084
Look what happened

04:19.171 --> 04:20.260
when my mother
tried that with us.

04:20.346 --> 04:21.522
And what choice
do we have?

04:21.608 --> 04:23.132
We can't let them
live like hobos

04:23.219 --> 04:24.568
in our filthy garage.

04:30.922 --> 04:33.011
Wow!

04:33.098 --> 04:34.448
So beautiful.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.058
Please to enter.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.974
Raduca, I have
to say

04:39.061 --> 04:41.542
it is incredible what you've
done with this place.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.805
No, no, no, this was Reese.

04:43.892 --> 04:44.806
He gets credit.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.287
Reese, you did this?

04:47.374 --> 04:50.638
He is very determined
when you give him task.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.422
Now, sweetie, you can't give me
all the credit.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.990
We both stomped that
spider nest together.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.688
Ah, yes, honeymoon.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.951
I am very impressed.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.040
Is this homework?!

05:02.127 --> 05:04.565
Yeah, Raduca won't let me
watch any television
until it's finished.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.175
Wives. Am I right?

05:07.219 --> 05:09.744
Education is key to better life.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.313
Reese!
Chair!

05:16.228 --> 05:17.882
I can't remember

05:17.969 --> 05:20.972
when I've had a baloney-and
Wheat-Crisp casserole this good.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.888
Reese has studying
for green card exam.

05:23.975 --> 05:27.501
We must know
every spouse's detail:

05:27.588 --> 05:31.635
Favorite color, toilet habit,
my menstruation cycle.

05:31.722 --> 05:32.897
I think I'm done.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.770
Reese! Plates!

05:43.560 --> 05:45.562
Did you see the way
she talks to him?

05:45.649 --> 05:47.434
She has broken
his spirit.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.305
He's not our Reese anymore.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.525
I know.
It's fantastic.

05:51.612 --> 05:52.656
Yeah.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.659
There's our little scholar.

05:55.746 --> 05:57.531
What?

05:57.618 --> 05:59.228
Malcolm, this is
Milt Anderson,

05:59.315 --> 06:01.578
-a recruiter from M.I.T.
-Dad...

06:01.665 --> 06:02.884
We talked about this,
and you're sitting here

06:02.971 --> 06:04.929
and listening to what he
has to say, got it?

06:05.016 --> 06:07.410
-But...
-Now, Malcolm, I know you've
got a lot of questions.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.978
Yeah.

06:12.023 --> 06:15.157
Uh, you're from M.I.T.

06:15.244 --> 06:18.334
That's right. Mississippi
Institute of Technology.

06:18.421 --> 06:19.422
What?

06:19.509 --> 06:21.032
Now, I know everybody always

06:21.119 --> 06:22.686
assumes it's Massachusetts.

06:22.773 --> 06:25.341
And hey, they do good work, too,
but can they offer you

06:25.428 --> 06:29.084
the same kind of God-centric
approach to science that we do?

06:30.651 --> 06:32.609
Now, I know you're a gentleman

06:32.696 --> 06:35.612
and you're not going
to want to make a decision

06:35.699 --> 06:37.005
until you come down

06:37.092 --> 06:38.920
and taste some
of the best catfish

06:39.007 --> 06:40.791
that ever melted
into your mouth!

06:40.878 --> 06:41.966
[ laughs]

06:43.315 --> 06:44.491
Dad, could I talk
to you for a second?

06:44.578 --> 06:46.231
Of course.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.712
Any chance you could
air ship some of those?

06:50.888 --> 06:52.760
Dad, this is a complete
waste of time.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.370
I've already told you

06:54.457 --> 06:56.067
there are only four
colleges in the whole world

06:56.154 --> 06:58.243
that have the nuclear biology
programs that I'm interested in.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.289
And this M.I.T. and
Kolumbia with a K

07:00.376 --> 07:01.769
aren't on the list.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.074
Maybe this isn't
the school of your dreams,

07:03.161 --> 07:04.946
but you need
a fallback position.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.817
Forget about it, Dad.
This is my decision

07:06.904 --> 07:08.297
and I'm not talking
to these bozos.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.691
All right, fine.
I'll do it for you.

07:10.778 --> 07:13.345
But one day, you'll thank me.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.610
Uh, Milt, you'll have
to excuse Malcolm.

07:16.697 --> 07:20.875
He, uh, had to do
some brain exercises.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.790
You know, mental squats
and such.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.053
Anyway, tell me about
your science department.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.228
Well, I'd love to.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.535
Let me just find
my brochure.

07:28.622 --> 07:32.626
Here, why don't you take
one of my key chains?

07:32.713 --> 07:34.105
It lights up!

07:34.192 --> 07:35.280
Mm-hmm.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.195
What else you got
in there?

07:37.282 --> 07:39.633
Ooh, uh, I like
that beer cozy.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.939
But I suppose
it's either or.

07:42.026 --> 07:45.508
Hm-hmm-hmm...

07:49.686 --> 07:52.210
Why do we have to get
a stupid green card anyway?

07:52.297 --> 07:53.908
I hate studying.
It's so boring.

07:53.995 --> 07:54.865
Shut up and

07:54.952 --> 07:56.824
look at my breasts!

07:56.911 --> 07:59.043
This is the kind of thing
that will be on test.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.916
Note the number and the position
of the beauty marks.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.789
Eyes down here!

08:08.400 --> 08:09.880
Look, I'm sorry.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.186
That's okay.

08:11.273 --> 08:12.579
Sometimes it's better

08:12.666 --> 08:14.189
to see water slides
from a distance.

08:14.276 --> 08:16.234
You make plans
for a perfectly good time,

08:16.321 --> 08:17.975
and they go and fix
the hole in the fence.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.282
I just wish I had the kind
of money to buy us tickets.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.284
I would have lent you
the six bucks.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.981
Hey, I don't roll that way.

08:24.068 --> 08:24.939
It's bad enough I'm letting
my little brother

08:25.026 --> 08:26.331
buy me dinner tonight.

08:26.418 --> 08:27.942
So what do you want
to do until then?

08:28.029 --> 08:29.770
We could wrestle.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.685
You want to wrestle
for seven hours?

08:31.772 --> 08:33.730
[ knocking]
MAN: You in there!
Where's my rent!

08:33.817 --> 08:35.384
Mr. Banner,

08:35.471 --> 08:37.385
I can't open the door right now.

in my mailbox in 48 hours!

08:54.577 --> 08:57.885
So, Greco-Roman or freestyle?

09:01.453 --> 09:04.761
Oh, no. No more studying.
I need a break.

What's that?
Who's there?

09:12.769 --> 09:14.597
Raduca, who is this?!

09:14.684 --> 09:18.122
Um, this is, um, Bela,

09:18.209 --> 09:20.429
and I have known him
for many years

09:20.516 --> 09:25.129
because... he is my brother.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.262
I can't believe you!

09:28.524 --> 09:30.613
You had your brother in town
and don't tell me?!

09:31.875 --> 09:33.877
Get over here!

09:41.711 --> 09:44.018
[ whistling happily]

09:44.105 --> 09:46.063
Sorry I kept you boys waiting.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.761
I thought I had 4:30.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.763
You told me 4:30
a week ago.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.026
Boys, please,
it's my fault.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.071
I've just had so many
recruiters calling,

09:54.158 --> 09:55.682
they've got me
coming and going.

09:55.769 --> 09:56.683
Tea?

09:56.770 --> 09:58.162
Waybridge, huh?

09:58.249 --> 09:59.816
Guess Nick beat us here.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.906
I just like the color.
It doesn't mean anything.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.995
You know, Grandville
has terrific sweaters.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.823
In fact,
we have a collapsible

10:06.910 --> 10:08.956
umbrella people love.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.828
Please, it's not about
merchandise.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.525
It's about education.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.614
Oh.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.702
Of course, it is easier to study

10:15.789 --> 10:17.225
when you're dry and toasty.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.445
You got it.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.012
Now,

10:22.099 --> 10:23.971
tell me about
your respective universities.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.973
At Grandville, the head
of our physics department

10:26.060 --> 10:27.322
just won a Nobel prize.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.932
That's very impressive.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.717
At Euclid, we think
it's about results.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.849
For example,
70% of Euclid graduates

10:32.936 --> 10:36.026
take care of their parents
in retirement.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.637
Oh, I like that.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.029
How can you keep
those stats?

10:39.116 --> 10:40.161
Do you have you no shame?

10:40.248 --> 10:41.684
Your Nobel prize
was shared, okay?

10:41.771 --> 10:42.729
Your cyclotron is underfunded.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.426
-How dare you!
-Boys...

10:44.513 --> 10:45.645
[ phone rings]

10:45.732 --> 10:47.603
Excuse me.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.257
Hello.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.998
Oh, um,

10:51.085 --> 10:53.000
yes.

10:55.089 --> 10:58.222
Hi, Barry. Yes, I've been
thinking about you, too.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.441
Listen, I can't talk.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.138
Is that Barry from Michigan?

11:01.225 --> 11:03.488
Well, never you mind
who's here.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.534
Yes, I got your muffins.
They were delicious

11:05.621 --> 11:06.709
and very thoughtful of you.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.670
Oh, stop! You are relentless.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.760
I hope I didn't keep you up
last night with all that noise.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.587
Geez, Reese, I don't want
to hear about your sex life.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.155
What? No, I was getting the oil
stains out of the driveway.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.983
-Oh.
-For your information,

11:20.070 --> 11:21.724
marriage isn't
just about sex.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.552
It's about commitment.
Anyway, you know

11:23.639 --> 11:25.597
we can't have sex
until after the waiting period.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.077
The waiting period?

11:27.164 --> 11:30.385
Poor, naive Malcolm.

11:30.472 --> 11:31.865
All women,
when they get married,

11:31.952 --> 11:34.432
require a waiting period
of six months to a year.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.217
You know, if you got
your nose out of a book,

11:36.304 --> 11:37.348
and started living
life a little,

11:37.435 --> 11:38.523
you might know these things.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.308
Raduca is
a delicate flower,

11:40.395 --> 11:41.831
and it's going
to take some time for her

11:41.918 --> 11:43.180
to get used to the idea
of being with a man.

11:43.267 --> 11:46.488
-Who's that?
-Her brother Bela.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.839
Doesn't look much like her.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.362
Shows how much you know.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.669
I've never seen two people
closer in my life.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.021
Mom, when
Raduca found out

11:58.108 --> 11:59.457
I took the food
out of your refrigerator,

11:59.544 --> 12:00.894
she was pretty upset.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.373
She says we shouldn't
be living off you.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.984
Really?

12:04.071 --> 12:07.683
I owe you
14 slices of bologna...

12:09.032 --> 12:11.034
a half a liter of soda...

12:13.950 --> 12:16.039
Reese, I was against
your marriage from
the beginning.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.519
I thought it was
a mistake for you

12:17.606 --> 12:19.216
to be tied down
so early in life.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.392
But, I see you
and Raduca together

12:21.479 --> 12:24.961
and, I must say,
I think she's good for you.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.485
You do?

12:27.572 --> 12:29.052
Why are you saying that?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.620
Well, I'm giving you
my blessing.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.578
I see what's happening here.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.102
You're using reverse psychology.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.581
It's not working.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.670
No, I'm really just saying
that I like her,

12:38.758 --> 12:40.760
and I like how you are
when you're with her.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.805
Nice try, Mom,
but I'm staying with Raduca.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.068
And I approve.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.461
You'd like me to think so,
wouldn't you?

12:46.548 --> 12:47.723
Yes, I would.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.203
Well, I'm staying with her, Mom.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.031
Check and mate.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.904
If you were worried
about today's

12:54.991 --> 12:57.124
activities, you can just relax.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.865
My neighbors are on vacation,

12:58.952 --> 13:02.390
so good-bye, Seelys,
hello, cable television.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.696
I have a better idea.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.438
There's a job center
I thought we could go to.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.049
Oh, I get it.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.094
My little bro
is worried about me.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.009
Maybe a little.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.185
Plus, cable is so overrated.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.144
Look, Dewey, I know it may seem

13:17.231 --> 13:18.885
like I don't have
a lot going on,

13:18.972 --> 13:20.930
but I've got plenty
of irons in the fire.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.540
Like my screenplay.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.547
It's only five pages.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.332
They're probably going
to bring in some
high-priced rewriter.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.595
Why should I do
his work for him?

13:33.682 --> 13:35.553
Do you have any
other irons?

13:35.640 --> 13:37.599
Look, I know it's tough
to break into Hollywood.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.558
I'd be pretty stupid
to rest everything on that.

13:40.645 --> 13:41.995
That's why
I'm training a possum.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.779
-To do what?
-Dial a phone,

13:43.866 --> 13:46.216
hop on one foot,
walk like John Wayne--

13:46.303 --> 13:49.524
stuff that people who visit
roadside circuses like to see.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.395
So, does that
put your mind at ease?

13:51.482 --> 13:54.311
Francis, you have to get a life.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.835
I have a life.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.272
I've got my hobbies,
my bus bench,

13:58.359 --> 13:59.926
the guys at the apartment pool.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.189
I'm only 12, and I can see
that this is a dead end.

14:02.276 --> 14:06.367
Oh. So you know what I should do
better than I do.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.022
-You're just like Mom.
-Maybe Mom has a point.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.414
Maybe just hanging out by
the pool

14:10.501 --> 14:11.546
isn't going to be
the stepping-stone

14:11.633 --> 14:13.069
you're hoping for.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.592
You never supported me!
All I'm saying is

14:14.679 --> 14:16.377
jobs don't just
drop out of the sky.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.389
I know we
fought about this,

14:28.476 --> 14:30.173
but the truth is
I'm actually glad

14:30.260 --> 14:32.654
you kept those college guys
off my back.

14:32.741 --> 14:35.526
Well, son,
it hasn't been easy.

14:35.613 --> 14:39.182
Today I've got two lunches,
a coffee...

14:39.269 --> 14:41.881
Oh! And I'm going bowling
with a guy from Yale.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.187
Thanks to you, I was
able to clear my head
and make my decision.

14:44.274 --> 14:45.667
No, you haven't.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.930
I have a lobster dinner
next Tuesday.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.150
I've decided to go to Harvard.

14:50.237 --> 14:54.719
Harvard? I waited at that frozen
yogurt shop for two hours,

14:54.806 --> 14:56.765
and he never showed!

14:56.852 --> 14:58.201
I just wrote a letter
of early acceptance.

14:58.288 --> 14:59.681
I'm mailing it today.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.030
They can accept me
as early as tomorrow,

15:01.117 --> 15:02.336
and all this will stop.

15:02.423 --> 15:03.728
-Stop?
-Thanks again, Dad.

wasn't such a great idea.

to show me a good time.

and immature for me

16:02.222 --> 16:03.658
Yeah, Travis. Rock on.

We actually
have a song

16:09.490 --> 16:10.404

16:10.491 --> 16:12.014

-Really?
-Yeah, man!

couldn't get wasted on beer,

16:18.716 --> 16:20.240

to practice all the time,

18:35.810 --> 18:37.290
You were just
leading all these guys on.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.815
I know. It's just...

18:43.557 --> 18:45.689
Malcolm,
I'm an average guy,

18:45.776 --> 18:47.256
in the middle of my life,

18:47.343 --> 18:50.085
in a job that can replace me
in an hour.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.522
I was never
an important man.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.917
You're the only important thing
I've ever done.

18:58.267 --> 19:01.401
Oh, God!

19:01.488 --> 19:03.446
Don't feel bad, Dad.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.969
You raised me.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.362
You deserve the attention.

19:06.449 --> 19:10.932
No! Vince left the check.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.329
Reese, what's wrong?

19:16.416 --> 19:18.896
I got the results of our green
card test in this envelope.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.420
But I just can't open it!

19:20.507 --> 19:22.378
I know I didn't pass.
I totally panicked.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.902
Oh, Reese,
don't be silly.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.775
These tests are for people
who aren't living together.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.124
Who aren't in love.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.604
You have a real marriage.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.301
This is no problem.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.868
-But, Mom, what if I...?
-You'll be fine.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.653
This is a mother's
promise to her son.

19:43.051 --> 19:46.620
Oh, wow, Reese.
I'm so, so sorry.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.361
Quit stalling!
How did I do?

19:48.448 --> 19:52.713
The INS is denying Raduca's
request for a green card.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.628
They're questioning
the validity of your marriage.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.760
They want her to report
to their office tomorrow.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.199
You said
Raduca had a tail?

20:00.286 --> 20:01.852
Might have a tail!

20:01.939 --> 20:02.679
I don't know what the hell
is going on back there!

20:02.766 --> 20:03.767
I was nervous.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.639
Reese, I feel just terrible.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.075
That's it.

20:07.162 --> 20:08.859
It's the end of my marriage.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.122
The one thing that was going
right in my life is ruined.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.950
No, Reese.
Nothing is ruined.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.474
If you love this girl,

20:14.561 --> 20:16.084
you'll find a way
to overcome this obstacle.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.912
I don't know.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.044
Remember when I told you you
couldn't keep that tarantula?

20:20.131 --> 20:23.091
Six months later,
what did I find in my salad?

20:23.178 --> 20:25.180
My tarantula.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.921
You hung onto it
because you loved it.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.053
And you love Raduca.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.881
We are not going to let
the United States government

20:30.968 --> 20:32.274
smash herwith a shoe.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.841
Come on.
Let's go tell her

20:33.928 --> 20:36.670
we'll figure out a way
to work this thing out.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.330
LOIS:
Oh, my God!

20:44.417 --> 20:46.984
REESE:
How come your brother
doesn't have a waiting period?!

20:49.596 --> 20:52.686
Dewey, I just got off the phone
with your English teacher.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.297
She said you got an "F"
on your paper.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.255
Huh!

20:56.342 --> 20:57.343
An "F"!

20:57.430 --> 20:59.040
You keep this up,

20:59.127 --> 21:00.824
you'll fail the class,
which will go on your record,

21:00.911 --> 21:02.173
which will determine where
you are placed in high school

21:02.261 --> 21:04.088
and where you will go
to college, if anywhere.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.438
Don't go to college.

21:05.525 --> 21:06.830
It's okay with me.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.528
How do you think

21:08.615 --> 21:10.573
you're going to make
your way in the world?

21:10.660 --> 21:12.227
You don't get it, Mom.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.142
Things take care
of themselves.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.405
Rock on.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.231
