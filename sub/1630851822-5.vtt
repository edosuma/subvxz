<i>[soft music]</i>

00:06.673 --> 00:08.925
- Okay, we're gonna turn
on the cameras.

00:09.008 --> 00:10.301
<i>Hey, guys, it's Selena,</i>

00:10.385 --> 00:12.178
<i>and today I have</i>
<i>a very special guest</i>

00:12.262 --> 00:13.263
<i>with me in the kitchen...</i>

00:13.346 --> 00:14.347
Did you get it?

00:14.431 --> 00:15.849
<i>My little sister Gracie.</i>

00:15.932 --> 00:17.767
- You just tap it?
- Yeah.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.562
- Oh, that's easy.
Oh, they're moving.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.480
<i>- We're both ready</i>
<i>to sharpen our skills</i>

00:22.564 --> 00:24.899
<i>with the help</i>
<i>of another amazing chef.</i>

00:24.983 --> 00:26.359
Yeah.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.736
<i>I'd better be on my toes</i>

00:27.819 --> 00:29.988
<i>or Gracie's gonna put me</i>
<i>to shame.</i>

00:32.031 --> 00:34.492
- Why do you just assume
I'm gonna burn something?

00:34.576 --> 00:36.661
- Have you seen the episodes?

00:36.745 --> 00:38.204
[laughter]

00:38.288 --> 00:40.749
- I'm just getting schooled
by my sister right now.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.417
- Yeah.
[doorbell rings]

00:42.500 --> 00:44.169
- Will you guys grab
the groceries, please?

00:44.252 --> 00:45.754
- Yes.
- Of course.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.882
So, Papa, every episode
they send a different guy.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.092
And so I've been, like,
kinda looking for the one.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.802
- I don't wanna have
nothing to do with that.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.013
- So many groceries today!
- Hi.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.140
- Hi, you've got such
a nice smile.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.433
- Oh, thank you so much.
- How are you?

00:58.516 --> 00:59.559
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.935
- Good, good.
- I know.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.062
She talks about guys
every episode.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.522
- All right,
you guys have a great day.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.609
- Thank you.
It's a happy day, guys.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.111
- Oh, gosh, here.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.447
Oh, what is this?
- Look, Raquelle.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.991

01:27.253 --> 01:28.588
- Just, like, go like that.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.674
- Selena and Richard, take two.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.510

<i>a restaurant owner,</i>

<i>Things might</i>

I want to introduce you

This is Gracie.
- Hi.

<i>- Hi.</i>

02:08.795 --> 02:10.380
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.508
Thank you so much for
letting me entertain for what

02:13.591 --> 02:18.263
I understand is a pretty
big celebration happening.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.306
It's someone's birthday!

02:20.390 --> 02:24.060
- Whoo-hoo!
Huge day.

02:24.143 --> 02:25.562
- She's very excited.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.896
- Yes, so today I'm gonna
show you how to make

02:26.980 --> 02:29.566
the ultimate
birthday bash menu.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.150
- Ooh.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.902
<i>- A DIY Nacho bar</i>

02:32.986 --> 02:34.737
<i>with quick</i>
<i>Carne Asada,</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:38.241
<i>and all the fixings</i>
<i>and things,</i>

02:38.324 --> 02:42.036
<i>And a DIY</i>
<i>ice cream sundae bar</i>

02:42.120 --> 02:43.955
<i>with liquid nitrogen</i>
<i>ice cream</i>

02:44.038 --> 02:46.583
<i>and some chocolate</i>
<i>dipped strawberries.</i>

02:46.666 --> 02:48.751
<i>What do you think, Gracie?</i>
<i>- Look good?</i>

02:48.835 --> 02:50.378
- Yes!
- [laughs]

02:50.461 --> 02:54.090
- It's great for me.
- We're so excited.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.925
- I think we're gonna
start it off

02:56.009 --> 02:58.553
with doing the last part
of our meal first,

02:58.636 --> 03:02.098
which is going to be
making homemade ice cream.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.933
- We're obsessed
with ice cream.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.393
- This is
an ice cream household.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.020
- Chocolate or vanilla?
<i>- Chocolate.</i>

03:07.103 --> 03:09.188
<i>- And I like vanilla.</i>
<i>So we'll do both.</i>

03:09.272 --> 03:10.732
How 'bout that?
How 'bout we do two flavors?

03:10.815 --> 03:12.442
<i>We're gonna</i>
<i>double the recipe.</i>

03:12.525 --> 03:14.068
And I'm glad that you have
a team over there, Selena,

03:14.152 --> 03:15.486
<i>because there's</i>
<i>a couple different things</i>

03:15.570 --> 03:17.322
<i>that have to happen.</i>

03:17.405 --> 03:19.824
<i>The first thing we're gonna</i>
<i>do to make our ice cream base</i>

03:19.908 --> 03:23.119
is measure out
the heavy cream and the milk.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.204
And we're gonna add it
to that sauce pot.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.414
- Got it.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.541
- In my younger days,
I was a DJ.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.960
And my DJ name was Heavy Cream.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.296
- No!
<i>- No one knows that.</i>

03:33.379 --> 03:34.756
- That's amazing.
<i>- Okay.</i>

03:34.839 --> 03:36.341
So you're gonna need three cups
of milk

03:36.424 --> 03:38.051
<i>and three cups of heavy cream.</i>

03:38.134 --> 03:39.886
- I'm just here alone
doing this.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.554
- Here, let's see if this is...
- I feel like we can use this.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.973
- Ow, my arm.
- You are such a drama queen.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.767
<i>- Yep, a cup and a half</i>
<i>of each, that's gonna work.</i>

03:45.850 --> 03:48.603
So you got three cups
of both.

03:48.686 --> 03:52.106
- Then you're going
to add a half cup of sugar.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.691
- Great.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.318
- And you're gonna add a little
bit of vanilla extract.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.653
- Okay.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.820
- What should I put
the stove on, medium?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.322
- Low to medium.
- Okay.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.490
- All you're looking
to do is just dissolve

04:00.573 --> 04:02.325
the sugar into the cream.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.327
And then just someone
sorta keep an eye on it.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.163
- I lit this kitchen
on fire twice.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.164
- [laughs]

04:08.247 --> 04:09.290
- I'll be on stove duty.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.750
- So you're on stove duty.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.251
- Yep.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.212
- So now we need to make
the other half of this mixture.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.172
So we're gonna have
to crack some eggs.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.049
<i>You're gonna need</i>
<i>eight egg yolks.</i>

04:18.132 --> 04:19.676
- Okay.
- Did you wash your hands?

04:23.304 --> 04:26.432
- You got it. God, you got it!
- Oh, one handed?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.142
- Good job.
- Hey, good job.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.312
- So if you want, just break
the whole egg into the bowl,

04:31.396 --> 04:33.439
and then what we can do
is just scoop out the yolk.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.066
That's fine.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.404
- Oh--
- Oh!

04:39.487 --> 04:41.864
- No!
- What?

04:41.948 --> 04:46.869
- There's an egg cracked
on the stepping stool.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.287
- We need help!
- Oh.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.832
We are off to a rough start.
- Oh, my gosh.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.876
This is so embarrassing
right now for so many reasons.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.628
<i>- It is not embarrassing.</i>
- Team, we gotta step it up.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.672
- My wife Jasmine just
told me I dropped an egg

04:57.755 --> 04:58.965
on the cat the other day.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.259
- Ew!
- On a cat?

05:01.342 --> 05:02.927
- On the cat.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.512
<i>So don't worry about just</i>
<i>dropping one on the floor.</i>

05:04.595 --> 05:06.222
And then once you get
to eight yolks,

05:06.305 --> 05:08.599
you're gonna go in there
and scoop out the yolks.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.059
- Yes!
- Okay.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.561
- And move the yolks
to another bowl.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.313
- All right, you ready?
- It's kind of difficult.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.773
- It's kinda fun.

05:15.857 --> 05:16.983
It's a little bit of therapy,
but some people

05:17.066 --> 05:18.359
might think it's kinda gross.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.236
- [laughs]
- Great!

05:20.319 --> 05:22.363
- Perfect, now, to the yolks,

05:22.447 --> 05:24.157
you're gonna add
a cup of sugar.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.492
You wanna add the ingredients
with a little flair, you know?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.036
- Ooh!
- Mmm.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.662
<i>- So now what you're</i>
<i>gonna do is we're gonna</i>

05:29.746 --> 05:31.914
<i>mix the sugar and</i>
<i>the egg yolks together.</i>

05:31.998 --> 05:33.583
<i>And now you're</i>
<i>gonna grab a whisk.</i>

05:33.666 --> 05:37.587
- Ooh, this is huge.
- So, like, I just clap.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.422
And then someone
throws me a whisk.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.798
- Oh, nice.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.216
- First of all, Gracie,

05:42.300 --> 05:43.593
that's the biggest whisk
I've ever seen.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.429
- It's kind of big.
- Yes, it's huge.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.431
- Do you want me to try,
and then you can finish it?

05:48.514 --> 05:50.433
<i>- And you really just</i>
<i>wanna combine the sugar</i>

05:50.516 --> 05:52.185
with the yolks so that you get

05:52.268 --> 05:53.978
sort of this texture
right here,

05:54.062 --> 05:57.148
<i>which is starting</i>
<i>to look like pastry cream.</i>

05:57.231 --> 05:59.067
So now we're gonna temper
the ice cream base.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.860
This is the cream on the back,
and it's hot?

06:00.943 --> 06:02.612
<i>It's warm?</i>
- Yeah, yes.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.822
- Okay, so bring the cream
to the front station.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.700
And what we're gonna do
is one person whisk

06:07.784 --> 06:10.953
and the other person just drip
in a little bit

06:11.037 --> 06:13.706
<i>of the hot cream mixture,</i>
<i>right?</i>

06:13.790 --> 06:15.291
- Oh--
<i>- The hot cream--yeah.</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:17.085
<i>Perfect, perfect,</i>
<i>so just a little bit.</i>

06:17.168 --> 06:19.587
<i>Now whisk that in</i>
<i>and let that come together.</i>

06:19.670 --> 06:22.799
<i>And then we add a little bit</i>
<i>more of the hot milk mixture.</i>

06:22.882 --> 06:24.801
<i>And this is called</i>
<i>tempering, right?</i>

06:24.884 --> 06:27.178
Because if we added
all of the cream,

06:27.261 --> 06:30.098
the hot cream, to the yolks,
it would cook the yolks

06:30.181 --> 06:31.766
and then
we'd have scrambled eggs.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.476
- Oh, wow.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.020
- You guys, I don't know
why I have this big of a whisk.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.647
- Why is nothing ever normal?

06:37.730 --> 06:40.024
- Now you're gonna add
all of that back to the pot.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.692
- Whee!
- Come on home.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.402
- Whee!
- Whoo!

06:43.486 --> 06:46.572
- Okay, now this goes back
on the stove on low heat again.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.366
- Back to stove duty.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.784
- While that's heating,
we're gonna

06:49.867 --> 06:51.828
do some chocolate
dipped strawberries.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.247
- I think someone's
very excited about that.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.207
- So you have
some melting chocolate.

06:56.290 --> 06:59.502
Put the chocolate chips in
the microwave for 30 seconds.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.088
Stir it a little bit
with a rubber spatula and then

07:02.171 --> 07:04.132
back in the microwave
for another 30 seconds.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.424
- Great.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.093
- Here's the next step for you,
Raquelle.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.970
With that ice cream mixture
now that's on the back,

07:09.053 --> 07:13.850
<i>we wanna remove half</i>
<i>of it to another mixing bowl.</i>

07:13.933 --> 07:16.018
So if you want it
to be half vanilla,

07:16.102 --> 07:18.062
half chocolate, that's what
we're gonna do right now

07:18.146 --> 07:20.481
is we're separating
the chocolate ice cream

07:20.565 --> 07:21.858
from the vanilla.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.484
So I'm gonna add half
of mine right here.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.862
That's gonna be my
vanilla ice cream.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.031
Now you're gonna take
that chocolate sauce.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.992
And you add as much
chocolate sauce

07:31.075 --> 07:32.660
as you want it
to be chocolatey.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.371
- Oh, you want it
extra chocolatey.

07:35.454 --> 07:38.040
- Okay, done.
How's the chocolate?

07:38.124 --> 07:40.376
- It's good, sissy.
- Okay.

07:40.459 --> 07:43.045
- Now we have three things
that are finished up over here.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.589
<i>We have our melted chocolate.</i>

07:44.672 --> 07:46.090
<i>And then we have chocolate</i>
<i>ice cream base,</i>

07:46.174 --> 07:47.717
<i>and we have vanilla</i>
<i>ice cream base.</i>

07:47.800 --> 07:49.802
So, let's transfer them
to metal mixing bowls.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.055
- Like this, Richard?
- [laughs]

07:53.139 --> 07:55.766
Gracie is doing what we all
wanna do right now, is just eat

07:55.850 --> 07:57.185
all of the chocolate,
which is--

07:57.268 --> 07:59.437
- Wait, dude!
- Sorry--

07:59.520 --> 08:02.231
- Oh, it's on her face!
- Oh, oops.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.359
I have to wipe my face.
- Oh.

08:05.443 --> 08:10.072
- And now is where we get
into the super fun part

08:10.156 --> 08:11.490
of making ice cream.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.577
We're gonna freeze it
with liquid nitrogen.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.038
<i>[soft music]</i>

08:17.121 --> 08:18.664
- Okay.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.417
- That should be at the front
door now or in the kitchen?

08:21.500 --> 08:23.502
- My grandfather actually
brought it in

08:23.586 --> 08:25.213
'cause it was heavy.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.423
I feel like--should he help?
- The more people, the better.

08:27.506 --> 08:30.301
- I don't think
I should be trusted

08:30.384 --> 08:31.761
with anything like that.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.263
- If you got goggles,
if you got gloves,

08:34.347 --> 08:37.266
if you have an apron,
go ahead and throw them on.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.228
I'm not going to do that 'cause
I'm a trained professional.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.938
- I think
I'm gonna wear these out.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.940
<i>- So here's a good lesson</i>
<i>on liquid nitrogen.</i>

08:44.023 --> 08:46.400
Nitrogen is part
of our atmosphere, right?

08:46.484 --> 08:47.735
So it's all around us.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.111
Every time
we actually take a breath,

08:49.195 --> 08:50.780
there's nitrogen in the air.

08:50.863 --> 08:54.033
And what we're using here
is the pressurized version

08:54.116 --> 08:58.037
of nitrogen, so it's gonna be
in a liquid form

08:58.120 --> 08:59.789
when it comes
out of this container.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.084
And it's going to be super,
super cold.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.710
It's actually negative

09:04.794 --> 09:08.381
360-something
degrees Fahrenheit.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.466
<i>♪ ♪</i>

09:10.549 --> 09:13.636
- So here it is.
This is liquid nitrogen.

09:13.719 --> 09:17.390
- Oh, it's that stuff.
Are you gonna do it?

09:17.473 --> 09:20.101
- Whoo!
We're gonna stand back.

09:20.184 --> 09:23.062
Yeah, Papa!
- It's so cool!

09:23.145 --> 09:25.773
- It's so cool!
- Oh, my God!

09:25.856 --> 09:27.650
- It's so cool.
<i>- How does it look?</i>

09:27.733 --> 09:29.068
- It's kind of a vibe.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.569
<i>- You might want</i>
<i>to put gloves on,</i>

09:30.653 --> 09:32.405
<i>especially</i>
<i>in the metal container.</i>

09:32.488 --> 09:34.282
- Oops.
- You got it.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.909
- And now one person
who's got the glove

09:36.993 --> 09:38.661
is gonna handle
the liquid nitrogen.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.496
Someone else
is gonna need a whisk.

09:40.579 --> 09:46.168
And you're going to slowly
add that to the ice cream base.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.380
<i>And you're gonna keep whisking</i>
<i>it and adding nitrogen</i>

09:49.463 --> 09:53.092
<i>until the whisk feels</i>
<i>like it's not liquid anymore.</i>

09:53.175 --> 09:55.428
- Oh.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.639
All right.
- Wow, so cool.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.808
- This is so cool.
- It's really cool.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.185
- Selena, you've got a song
about ice cream, don't you?

10:03.269 --> 10:07.356
- Yes, I do.
How did you know, Richard?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.026
- All right.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.862
Yay, oh, my God, we did it!
- We're good!

10:12.945 --> 10:14.196
- There it is!

10:14.280 --> 10:16.782
<i>Now put that bowl</i>
<i>in the freezer.</i>

10:16.866 --> 10:19.827
And then do the same thing
with the other flavor.

10:19.910 --> 10:23.372
- I casually could just
go buy this at a store, and--

10:23.456 --> 10:25.124
- Well, there's
a couple different--I mean,

10:25.207 --> 10:27.335
you befriend a chemist,
or you say

10:27.418 --> 10:29.086
you're doing some
bathroom remodeling

10:29.170 --> 10:31.297
or I just-- I'll
drop some over.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.174
<i>You let me know the next</i>
<i>time you wanna do</i>

10:33.257 --> 10:34.717
<i>a liquid nitrogen party.</i>

10:34.800 --> 10:36.218
<i>We'll make sure</i>
<i>you're taken care of.</i>

10:36.302 --> 10:37.887
- You're more than welcome.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.347
- Is this the coolest thing
you've done on the show?

10:39.430 --> 10:42.141
- Yeah, it is.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.477
- So now, Gracie,
just remember this moment, too,

10:44.560 --> 10:47.355
<i>because when you get</i>
<i>in seventh or eighth grade,</i>

10:47.438 --> 10:49.065
<i>you're gonna have</i>
<i>a science teacher</i>

10:49.148 --> 10:51.150
<i>that does this</i>
<i>demonstration in class.</i>

10:51.233 --> 10:52.735
And you're gonna be like,
"You know what?

10:52.818 --> 10:54.320
Richard Blais, five years ago."

10:54.403 --> 10:57.156
- That's right.
- Richard Blais!

10:57.239 --> 10:59.283
- How old were you when
you started cooking?

10:59.367 --> 11:01.744
- Probably 14 years old,

11:01.827 --> 11:04.830
and my first job was
at a little restaurant

11:04.914 --> 11:07.708
that serves burgers,
and fries, and milkshakes.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.336
You probably never heard of it.
It was McDonald's.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.254
<i>Place called McDonald's?</i>
[laughter]

11:12.338 --> 11:13.881
Oh, you've heard of it, okay.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.466
I was the poissonier,

11:15.549 --> 11:16.967
which means "fish cook"
in French.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.011
- What was it, the fish fillet?
<i>- Yes.</i>

11:19.095 --> 11:20.596
- Well, impressive.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.765
- Did you get both
flavors done already?

11:22.848 --> 11:24.266
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, great.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.601
So now we're gonna get
some strawberries out

11:25.684 --> 11:27.228
and some wooden skewers.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.688
Everyone loves
chocolate dipped strawberries.

11:29.772 --> 11:33.067
Just cut off the leaves
of the strawberries.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.653
- And real simply,
I am going to skewer

11:35.736 --> 11:37.321
these strawberries, right?

11:37.405 --> 11:38.906
So just kinda--
- Okay.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.449
<i>- And we're gonna use</i>
<i>the nitrogen again</i>

11:40.533 --> 11:42.952
to sort of make sure
that that shell gets nice

11:43.035 --> 11:46.038
<i>and crispy and</i>
<i>coats the whole strawberry.</i>

11:46.122 --> 11:48.916
So transfer
the nitrogen to a bowl.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.752
<i>I'm just gonna use the same</i>
<i>container I have here.</i>

11:51.836 --> 11:53.170
Okay, so here we go.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.839
Now you're gonna take
these strawberries,

11:54.922 --> 11:57.007
and you're gonna dip them
in the chocolate.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.468
<i>The strawberry gets dipped</i>
<i>into the nitrogen,</i>

11:59.552 --> 12:00.928
and it just comes right out,

12:01.011 --> 12:03.305
<i>like, for not even--</i>
<i>a second or two.</i>

12:03.389 --> 12:05.474
- Oh, beautiful.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.059
No!
- No.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.269
- [laughs]

12:08.352 --> 12:10.187
<i>- That's all right.</i>

12:10.271 --> 12:12.356
- I keep dropping 'em.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.066
- Okay, so we are done

12:14.150 --> 12:16.318
with the liquid nitrogen part
of the show.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.946
We got through it, fam!
We got through it!

12:19.029 --> 12:20.698
- Goodness.
- Whoo!

12:20.781 --> 12:22.324
- So now we're gonna
clean up a little bit,

12:22.408 --> 12:26.203
get organized for the nacho
part of our party.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.331
Gracie, do you like
spicy food or not so much?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.167
- She does.
- You do?

12:31.250 --> 12:32.918
Amazing.
- I love spicy food.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.712
- We're gonna
make Pico de Gallo.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.630
We're gonna use tomatoes,
onions,

12:36.714 --> 12:40.509
jalapeño, or a serrano,
some cilantro, and some lime.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.345
Really, really, really, simple.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.722
All right.

12:44.805 --> 12:48.267
- My sister is living
in her own world.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.103
- She's juggling.
- I'm trying.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.688
- I love it.
I love it.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.482
- Good job.
- Good job, sissy.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.276
- Hold on, I have tomatoes.
I'll just try to do the fake.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.153
It's only two tomatoes,
but it looks good, doesn't it?

12:59.236 --> 13:02.781
- Oh, he--look at him!
Look at Richard!

13:02.865 --> 13:05.034
- One hit the floor.
That's all right.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.827
<i>Who's got</i>
<i>the best knife skills?</i>

13:06.911 --> 13:08.621
- [blows raspberry]
- Me!

13:08.704 --> 13:10.873
- No. Okay.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.584
- So what we're gonna do
is we're going to dice up

13:13.667 --> 13:15.169
three or four tomatoes.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.880
Now what I like to do
is just cut them into fours.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.716
Then I'm just gonna go back
across them using that claw

13:20.799 --> 13:23.802
motion on my hand
and cut them into a dice.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.137
- Right.
- Okay.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.847
So now we have
the tomatoes in there.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.016
Now it's time for the onions.
We want a halved onion.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.894
And then very carefully,
I'm gonna run my knife

13:31.977 --> 13:35.105
vertically through the half of
an onion to make these strips.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.441
And if you really wanna
show off for whoever

13:37.525 --> 13:39.944
the next chef is,
hold the knife like this.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.321
And then I'm gonna
rock my knife back and forth

13:42.404 --> 13:43.906
over the onions.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.575
And then it's just like this.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.745
- Wow, look at him go!

13:49.828 --> 13:54.583
- That is impressive, Richard!
- Richard!

13:54.667 --> 13:56.293
- Selena's showing off now,
too.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.461
- No, I'm not!

13:57.545 --> 14:00.297
- Look at those skills!
- Wow!

14:00.381 --> 14:03.425
- So just add as many onions
to the Pico as you'd like.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.593
- Okay.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.595
- Raquelle,
do you want to start

14:06.679 --> 14:08.430
the beans on the back stove?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.266
I think we can do that.
- Yeah, I would love to.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.227
- Now also, Selena,
I sent a can opener to you?

14:13.310 --> 14:16.438
- Oh, yes, thank you.
- That really blessed us.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.940
- Because, you know, I'm a fan.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.400
I'm a fan, and I've noticed
that the can opener

14:19.483 --> 14:21.777
has been--it's a thing.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.613
- The stuff they have
now is too high tech.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.740
I don't understand any of it.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.993
- It's caused us many problems.

14:29.076 --> 14:31.036
- Papa, can you help me?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.788
- She can't
open the tomato paste.

14:32.871 --> 14:34.248
- Don't laugh at me.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.708
- This is what happens
when you get fancy stuff.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.127
You just need
a regular can opener.

14:38.210 --> 14:42.089
- Ugh, this
is like a nightmare.

14:42.172 --> 14:43.507
- Oh, I think you're--
- No.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.634
- Oh, no, it's the can.
It's not you.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.844
- Is Ayesha waiting?

14:47.845 --> 14:49.430
- Ugh!

14:49.513 --> 14:52.224
- No one needs, like, a voice
activated digital can opener.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.226
- Is that a real thing?

14:54.310 --> 14:55.644
- No, I just made it up.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.646
But should I
continue the pursuit, or...

14:57.730 --> 15:00.357
So real simple,
I've got a pretty big can.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.984
I'm just
gonna use half over here.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.652
And then just grab
your favorite hot sauce.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.321
And put a little hot
sauce in the beans.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.989
- Oh, yum.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.408
- A couple shakes of hot sauce,
Gracie, right in the beans.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.243
Oh, yeah.
- Ooh.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.745
- That's good.
- I like it.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.330
- Okay, good, babe.
- That's perfect.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.749
All right, Gracie,
also while you're over there,

15:16.832 --> 15:18.167
grab some salt.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.627
Let's add some salt.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.170
You know Salt Bae, right?
- Yeah.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.964
- Like, Salt Bae,
he adds-he adds salt like this.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.008
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- I know Salt Bae, yeah.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.303
- Like, it's not Salt Bae
when I do it, it's Salt Blais.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.180
- Ohh.
- Salt Blaise!

15:31.263 --> 15:32.848
- [laughs]

15:32.931 --> 15:35.184
Just warm the beans up,
low heat.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.769
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.187
- Selena,
back to the cutting board.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.022
We're gonna
do the jalapeño, right?

15:40.105 --> 15:42.858
- This isn't a jalapeño.
Is this a jalapeño?

15:42.941 --> 15:44.360
- No, that's a poblano,
but you know what?

15:44.443 --> 15:46.528
Grab that anyway, 'cause
we're gonna use that too.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.781
- All right.
- We got the chili.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.949
And I'm gonna do just
what I did with the tomatoes.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.577
<i>It's like--I don't have any</i>
<i>seeds in this piece over here.</i>

15:53.661 --> 15:55.162
<i>I just--</i>
- That could've been you.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.165
- Seeds are what's
bringing the spice to it.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.669
- Okay, I can do it.
- Oh, no.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.212
- Ugh.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.714
- Cut it into strips.
And then cut them into a dice.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.424
- Oh, I smell it
from over here.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.718
- I'm crying.
- I know, I'm crying, too.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.930
- Okay, I've got a bunch of
cilantro that's gonna be next.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.683
This does not have to be
too, you know, perfect.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.351
<i>It doesn't have to be fine.</i>

16:17.434 --> 16:20.854
<i>And then I'm gonna add</i>
<i>a handful of cilantro.</i>

16:20.938 --> 16:22.398
- That was a close call!

16:22.481 --> 16:23.982
- It's all good, I'm here.
It's--nothing happened.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.901
- Are we all good?
- Yup.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.487
- Gracie, you wanna
add some salt to this?

16:28.570 --> 16:31.198
- Right here, babe.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.701
<i>- Perfect, perfect, all right,</i>
<i>and tomatoes love salt.</i>

16:33.784 --> 16:36.620
So you can do two or three
little pinches of salt.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.497
<i>And now we're gonna</i>
<i>add some lime juice.</i>

16:38.580 --> 16:39.957
<i>All right, Selena, do you</i>
<i>got a lime in front of you?</i>

16:40.040 --> 16:41.375
- Yes, I do.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.751
- I would say squeeze
all of it into your pico.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.879
- Whoo!
<i>- There it is.</i>

16:45.963 --> 16:49.133
<i>Grab a spoon,</i>
<i>and give it a gentle mix.</i>

16:49.216 --> 16:50.718
- You wanna stir it now?

16:50.801 --> 16:52.094
- Sure.
- Okay.

16:52.177 --> 16:56.098
- We need that large
pepper now, the poblano.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.474
- Whoa.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.643
<i>- Turn on a burner</i>
<i>on the back stove.</i>

16:59.727 --> 17:00.853
- Okay.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.312
- You're just gonna
take the poblano

17:02.396 --> 17:04.440
and put it directly
on the fire.

17:04.523 --> 17:08.861
Or, of course,
if you've got a little, like,

17:08.944 --> 17:11.196
miniature flame thrower
hangin' around because you're

17:11.280 --> 17:15.576
a total dork, you can
just use a flame thrower.

17:15.659 --> 17:19.955
- My papa won't let me
use it anymore.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.458
He says it's too dangerous.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.835
[laughter]
- Oh, my gosh, all right.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.879
<i>Just let it get nice</i>
<i>and charred.</i>

17:26.962 --> 17:28.964
You don't have to
do anything else.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.716
Here's what we're looking for.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.844
- My grandmother lived
and breathed for cooking food,

17:33.927 --> 17:37.598
and all we did
was char every single thing.

17:37.681 --> 17:38.974
It's so good.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.726
- Just keep throwing
things on the grill

17:40.809 --> 17:42.561
and developing all that flavor.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.396
You can pull it off the stove.
- Okay.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.024
- If it's nice and black
and roasted, then it's done.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.528
- Okay.
- You know what, don't we all?

17:51.612 --> 17:53.405
Don't we all wanna
take a little break

17:53.489 --> 17:54.865
<i>from time to time?</i>
- Yes.

17:54.948 --> 17:58.368
- One person's gotta dice
the poblano pepper.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.371
<i>Then we're gonna get ready</i>
<i>to make our cheese sauce.</i>

18:01.455 --> 18:02.873
- The best part.

18:02.956 --> 18:06.752
- The cheese sauce is
going to start with roughly

18:06.835 --> 18:10.172
a quart of cream or milk
at home if somebody wants some.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.507
- So I have
to be honest with you.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.841
I do not know what a quart is.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.384
- It is four cups.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.845
Four cups equals a quart.
- Oh, there you go.

18:16.929 --> 18:22.851
- And then you need melty,
ooey, gooey nacho cheese sauce,

18:22.935 --> 18:24.144
right?

18:24.228 --> 18:25.729
- Is this the gooey cheese?

18:25.813 --> 18:29.441
Does this look right to you?
- Oh, no, that is ghee.

18:29.525 --> 18:33.195
That is butter.
- Oh, so what about this?

18:33.278 --> 18:35.114
This looks good, right?
- Does it say cheese on it?

18:35.197 --> 18:37.699
- Yeah.
- Great.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.993
Now, when that cream mixture
is warm,

18:40.077 --> 18:42.037
you're just gonna
spoon in a couple cups.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.330
And you can eyeball this.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.666
- Yes.
- All right.

18:45.749 --> 18:49.253
We have shredded Monterey Jack
cheese and shredded mozzarella.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.587
- Yum.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.131
- I'm gonna add half
of the mozzarella

18:53.215 --> 18:56.009
and half
of the Monterey Jack cheese.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.387
And that's gonna get
real stretchy now.

we need the spices.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.558

salt,

19:51.231 --> 19:53.859

that was almost the cheese.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.319
- Yes.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.780
You're gonna need
a pretty big sauté pan

21:39.923 --> 21:41.925

celebrity cooking?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.218

I would never,

21:45.554 --> 21:49.891
A, I'd make a fool of myself
and, B, me and Raquelle

21:49.975 --> 21:52.644

21:52.728 --> 21:54.688

absolutely not.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.398
It would be a disaster.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.400
- Raquelle, will you tell me
when I have food in my hair?

21:58.483 --> 22:01.194
- It's hard for me
to keep track, you know?

22:01.278 --> 22:02.696
- So I got ghee.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.073

a tablespoon's worth of ghee.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.410
<i>Ghee is also called</i>
<i>clarified butter.</i>
