WEBVTT

00:10.960 --> 00:13.997
TERRA MESA, NEW MEXICO

00:21.330 --> 00:23.742
It's so cool we got in here.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.786
Okay, you two have fun.

00:33.330 --> 00:34.661
Where you been?

00:34.670 --> 00:37.036
Where did you say the bathroom was?

00:37.040 --> 00:38.951
Upstairs. Second door on the left.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.746
I'll be right back.

01:09.620 --> 01:11.247
There's our girl.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.410
That's her.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.161
Ingﬁd?

01:54.540 --> 01:56.030
Ingﬁd?

01:58.540 --> 02:00.667
Have you guys seen Ingrid?

02:28.960 --> 02:31.110
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

02:46.330 --> 02:47.820
What are you doing out of your bunker?

02:47.830 --> 02:51.914
I was on my way to file
the things that I file.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.489
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.877
-I'm looking...
-Sean?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.609
Hey. Derek.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.377
-You must be looking for your brother.
-Yeah.

03:04.380 --> 03:05.699
Right this way.

03:06.330 --> 03:09.822
"Brother" as in... That's Hotch's brother?

03:10.380 --> 03:12.075
Maybe Hotch is adopted.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.287
So, Georgetown Law.
You're doing big things.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.917
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.069
Top of the stairs.

03:18.210 --> 03:19.325
Come in.

03:20.670 --> 03:23.070
Sean. Hey, let me call you back.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.287
Hey! This is a surprise.

03:25.290 --> 03:27.326
Haven't cut your hair since Thanksgiving.

03:27.330 --> 03:30.379
-That's what you said at Christmas.
-Sorry.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.320
It's your first time here.
Let me give you the tour.

03:34.330 --> 03:36.742
Yeah, I can't stay long.
I'm working the lunch shift.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.868
Well, not for long. Congratulations.
You must be pretty excited.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.957
I'm not going to Georgetown.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.827
-What?
-I changed my mind.

03:46.830 --> 03:49.537
I got this job offer to work
at this restaurant in New York.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.610
It's not as chef,
but it's under the right one.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.498
-So, I can learn from him.
-What are you talking about?

03:54.500 --> 03:56.070
I made up my mind.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.617
Sean, you've always wanted to be a lawyer.

03:58.620 --> 04:00.417
Just like Dad, just like me.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.787
And look what it got Dad, huh?
Heart attack at 47.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.706
Well, I think I'm doing okay.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.700
Look, if it's about being in New York,

04:08.710 --> 04:11.110
NYU's got a great law school.
Columbia, Fordham...

04:11.120 --> 04:12.530
I don't think you're hearing me.

04:12.540 --> 04:14.872
All I'm asking you to do
is think it through. You know?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.575
The logical thing is for you
to go to Georgetown.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.070
I have to trust my instincts.

04:18.080 --> 04:21.243
Look, Sean, it's typical for someone
who lost his father at a young age...

04:21.250 --> 04:23.616
You know what? You're not him.

04:24.460 --> 04:26.530
Then why are you here?

04:26.540 --> 04:28.531
That's a really good question.

04:31.540 --> 04:32.746
Here he comes.

04:33.790 --> 04:35.872
-That's Hotch's brother?
-Uh-huh.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.700
-I don't see it.
-Sean, listen to me.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.871
All I'm saying is
you're 25 years old and it's...

04:39.880 --> 04:42.667
You know what? Don't profile me, Aaron!

04:47.210 --> 04:48.916
Now I see it.

04:56.210 --> 05:00.032
Terra Mesa, New Mexico. Five dead.
All from Mesa University.

05:00.040 --> 05:03.282
No signs of sexual assault
and no sign of theft.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.377
Five 19-year-olds.
Minimal defensive wounds?

05:08.380 --> 05:11.702
One of them was impaled on
a six-foot wooden pole.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.746
Who'd want to torture
five college freshmen?

05:13.750 --> 05:15.377
They weren't tied up and no one escaped?

05:15.380 --> 05:18.918
No single UnSub could have exerted
this much control over so many people.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.911
So, you think there was more than two?

05:20.920 --> 05:22.660
I think we're looking at a pack.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.571
-A pack?
-Three or more that kill in unison.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.162
As in nature, the group dynamic
dictates that the pack's survival

05:28.170 --> 05:30.536
is dependent on their ability
to hunt successfully.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.952
And, as in nature,
a pack will keep on killing

05:32.960 --> 05:36.578
-until it runs out of prey or is stopped.
-Stopped by what?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.319
A stronger pack.

06:15.580 --> 06:19.664
Nietzsche wrote, "The
individual has always had to struggle

06:19.670 --> 06:22.321
"to keep from being overwhelmed
by the tribe."

06:29.380 --> 06:31.416
I say this is one for the Feds.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.416
-Sheriff, I'm Special Agent Hotchner.
-Hi.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.662
-These are Agents Reid and Gideon.
-I was hoping there were more of you.

06:38.670 --> 06:40.240
The other agents went straight
to the station house

06:40.250 --> 06:42.377
to look at _the victims' files.
Has forensrcs had any luck?

06:42.380 --> 06:45.247
The county CSU went through
for prints and trace evidence.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.070
They said with all the workmen
tramping through here,

06:47.080 --> 06:49.241
looking at footprints would be a waste.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.285
Come on.

06:52.920 --> 06:56.412
The bodies were almost completely
skinned. Yet, there's so little blood.

06:56.420 --> 06:58.160
I think I know why.

06:58.170 --> 07:00.912
The UnSub avoided areas of skin
on the wrist and throat,

07:00.920 --> 07:04.071
areas where the veins and arteries
are closest to the surface.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.036
Why would they do that?

07:06.040 --> 07:08.326
They didn't want them to bleed out.

07:08.330 --> 07:10.321
These kids were skinned alive.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.248
Two cases of beer. Two sleeping bags.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.241
There's a third sleeping bag upstairs.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.741
Everything you need for a night
of teenage romance.

07:21.750 --> 07:25.618
It's unlikely that two couples brought
a fifth wheel to take notes.

07:25.620 --> 07:28.418
Sheriff, it's possible there was
a third girl here. A sixth victim.

07:28.420 --> 07:31.207
I'll get my deputies to canvass
the area. See if anybody saw a girl.

07:31.210 --> 07:32.529
You said there was another one outside?

07:32.540 --> 07:33.575
Yeah.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.701
He was like the others.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.377
Coroner said from the amount of blood

07:38.380 --> 07:40.450
he was alive when they impaled him.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.916
I know this is going to sound strange,

07:41.920 --> 07:44.411
but the way the victims were flayed alive,

07:44.420 --> 07:48.379
mutilated, and now the impalement
display of this last victim...

07:49.210 --> 07:50.245
What?

07:50.670 --> 07:53.992
These were all war rituals of
the Native American Plains Indians.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.115
Does that mean something to you, Sheriff?

07:55.120 --> 07:56.280
I'll say it does.

07:56.290 --> 07:58.952
Everything you see around us
is Apache land.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.611
This whole basin is a sacred burial ground

08:01.620 --> 08:04.282
and was the site of a number
of massacres as I understand.

08:04.290 --> 08:07.418
-So, this development is on their land?
-It was their land,

08:07.420 --> 08:09.661
but they didn't have the money
or the inclination to build on it.

08:09.670 --> 08:11.160
So the town seized half of it.

08:11.170 --> 08:12.660
Yeah, last year the Supreme Court ruled

08:12.670 --> 08:15.036
_ that cities can use _
eminent domain authority to seIze

08:15.040 --> 08:17.747
and repossess undeveloped
private land for private development.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.787
And now the town is looking for
investors to build on the other half.

08:20.790 --> 08:22.997
The Apache are fighting it,
of course, in court.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.377
There been any violence until now?

08:25.380 --> 08:26.495
Nothing like this.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.071
You know anybody on the reservation
capable of this?

08:29.080 --> 08:31.378
I don't know.
Reservation's federal jurisdiction.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.450
Sounds like where we need to go.

08:33.710 --> 08:36.372
We'll call Garcia. See what she can find.

08:36.380 --> 08:39.611
Okay, one order of bad guys on the
Apache reservation coming right up.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.780
Let's hear it.

08:40.790 --> 08:44.248
Apparently, there was a militant group
there in the '70s called the IRM.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.457
-Any of them still around?
-No,

08:46.460 --> 08:47.996
but there's a guy on the reservation now,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.412
who's been locked up more than
a few times for demonstrations,

08:50.420 --> 08:53.662
resisting arrest,
mostly political protest type stuff.

08:53.670 --> 08:57.458
Get this, his father was killed
in a shootout with federal agents

08:57.460 --> 08:58.700
at Wounded Knee.

08:58.710 --> 09:01.918
His name, Benjamin Blackwolf.
The son, John Blackwolf.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.239
Thanks, Garcia.

09:04.290 --> 09:05.996
-Blackwolf

09:06.000 --> 09:07.285
You know him?

09:07.670 --> 09:09.069
Indian activist.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.321
He's been in a little trouble related
to his activism,

09:11.330 --> 09:13.321
but nothing violent. And not around here.

09:13.330 --> 09:15.616
Should we call the reservation police
and alert them?

09:15.620 --> 09:18.327
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-Why not?

09:18.330 --> 09:20.571
Blackwolf is the reservation police.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.576
Jane Bear, these are FBI agents.

09:40.880 --> 09:41.995
-Gideon.
-Hello.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.160
-Hello.
-Hotchner.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.319
-How do you do?
-Hi.

09:44.330 --> 09:45.740
-And Reid.
-Hl.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.706
Miss Bear is the president
of the tribal council

09:47.710 --> 09:49.746
and principal of the reservation school.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.537
A president and a principal?
Must be a busy woman.

09:52.540 --> 09:55.532
We're out here on our own,
Agent Gideon. We all do our part.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.030
Is John inside?

09:58.710 --> 10:00.371
This about the Terra Mesa killings?

10:00.380 --> 10:01.745
They just want to talk to him.

10:01.750 --> 10:05.038
John Blackwolf has done more to help
his tribe than anyone.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.077
Hell, Jim, how many times have
you called him in to find lost hikers?

10:08.080 --> 10:11.288
How many drunken campers has
he tracked down for the park service?

10:11.290 --> 10:12.575
John is a peaceful man...

10:17.170 --> 10:18.910
What does this have to do with Terra Mesa?

10:18.920 --> 10:20.456
Well, a lot, if John considers

10:20.460 --> 10:21.870
the building of the Terra Mesa development

10:21.880 --> 10:24.610
on Apache land to be an attack.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.458
The developers have paid a lot of
families to leave the reservation.

10:29.460 --> 10:32.418
So many families have gone now
that we can barely fill a single class.

10:32.420 --> 10:35.321
Forcing the Dene, the Apache nation,

10:35.330 --> 10:37.116
to abandon their homes
and live In government controlled

10:37.120 --> 10:38.701
internment camps.

10:38.710 --> 10:41.326
Does anybody know
the last tribe to surrender

10:41.330 --> 10:42.615
to the American government?

10:42.620 --> 10:44.030
Chiricahua.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.872
It was the Chiricahua Apache.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.532
And does anybody know the name
of the last leader of the Apaches?

10:50.540 --> 10:51.825
I know.
- Geronimo.

10:51.830 --> 10:53.411
I know.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.160
-Geronimo.
-That's right.

10:55.170 --> 10:58.378
He was caught by the US army five times.

10:58.710 --> 11:02.282
But the Gahe
had given him so much strength

11:02.290 --> 11:04.702
he escaped each time.

11:06.380 --> 11:07.950
-Samuel.
-Yes?

11:07.960 --> 11:10.167
Tell the men from the FBI
who the Gahe are.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.616
The Gahe are mighty spirits
who dwell in desert caves.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.781
Reid, is your name Samuel?

11:16.330 --> 11:17.376
Sorry.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.952
Are the Gahe good spirits or bad spirits?

11:21.960 --> 11:23.416
They're both.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.451
Like men.

11:26.620 --> 11:29.111
I'll take over for you, John.

11:41.460 --> 11:45.112
Mr. Blackwolf, I'm Agent Gideon.
These are agents Hotchner and Reid.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.281
You look like a college professor.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.872
You look like his student.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.996
You, you look like FBI.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.611
We're with the Behavioral Analysis Unit.

11:55.620 --> 11:58.418
-Profilers should know better.
-How's that?

11:58.420 --> 12:01.036
We don't do massacres. You do.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.702
-Me, personally?
-Your government.

12:05.210 --> 12:07.747
Mr. Blackwolf, we'd like for you
to take a look at these photos

12:07.750 --> 12:10.537
and help us figure out how
these kids were killed.

12:10.540 --> 12:12.371
You're not asking because I'm a cop.

12:12.380 --> 12:16.282
No, we're asking because you're
an expert on Native American culture.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.957
I don't base my opinion
on pictures, Mr. Hotchner.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.746
I have to walk the ground.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.951
We should start inside.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.780
Forensics says
the outside's been contaminated

12:32.790 --> 12:34.496
from all the construction traffic.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.036
Of all the Native American tribes,

12:36.040 --> 12:38.611
the Apache were most renowned
for their tracking ability.

12:38.620 --> 12:41.111
It was said they could track a man
or animal through any condition

12:41.120 --> 12:44.032
by simply noticing the slightest
disturbance in the environment.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.746
It's profiling the dirt.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.616
I notice you don't carry a gun.

12:49.620 --> 12:50.951
Twenty-one feet.

12:51.210 --> 12:52.279
What?

12:52.710 --> 12:55.281
Ask Agent Hotchner, there.
He's the real gun hand.

12:55.290 --> 12:58.248
-Why do you say that?
-You carry two guns.

12:59.290 --> 13:01.497
The maximum distance
an attacker with a knife

13:01.500 --> 13:03.240
can close in the time it takes to react,

13:03.250 --> 13:05.571
draw your side arm and fire is 21 feet.

13:05.580 --> 13:07.616
Inside 21 feet, I win.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.828
Outside 21, I have
other options besides shooting a man.

13:10.830 --> 13:12.377
Like negotiating.

13:12.380 --> 13:15.918
-Like running.
-Why do you say I carry two guns?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.286
Your right instep print's heavier
than your left.

13:18.290 --> 13:20.827
And since you don't appear
to have a club right foot...

13:20.830 --> 13:22.240
You can't tell that from my footprints.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.911
There's no perceptible difference
between them.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.458
Your problem isn't with your prints.
It's with your perception.

13:33.420 --> 13:34.739
What do you see?

13:35.420 --> 13:36.876
There's a saying,

13:36.880 --> 13:39.610
"Once too much blood has been spilled
on the same ground,

13:39.620 --> 13:41.668
"that ground develops a thirst for it."

13:41.670 --> 13:44.321
This is all consistent with
Native American warfare rituals.

13:44.330 --> 13:46.912
But it's not Apache.

13:46.920 --> 13:50.412
Whoever did this carried out the most
brutal practices of the Apache,

13:50.420 --> 13:56.108
Navajo, Comanche, Pueblo, and Sioux.

13:56.120 --> 13:59.749
No one tribe ever did them all.
Not like this.

13:59.750 --> 14:03.117
Real Indians would know that.
This wasn't Indians.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.167
And if you want to figure out
who did this,

14:07.170 --> 14:09.821
it might help to know there was
a sixth person in the house.

14:09.830 --> 14:11.206
Why do you say that?

14:11.210 --> 14:15.704
Female. Ninety, 95 pounds.
Size six shoe. Fallen arches.

14:15.710 --> 14:18.782
She was walking alone
when she was ambushed by two men.

14:18.790 --> 14:21.202
We also believe there were
at least three suspects.

14:21.210 --> 14:23.917
Three? Yeah.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.878
Two over here
plus at least SIX over there.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.496
Because while_these two carri_ed
this gIrl struggling to their vehicle

14:29.500 --> 14:32.412
to the east,
at least six others ran single file

14:32.420 --> 14:34.035
to hide their numbers, from the west.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.076
So, you're saying that there were eight?

14:36.080 --> 14:37.115
At least.

14:38.330 --> 14:39.706
And one hostage.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.201
You wanted to see how
I'd behave at the scene of the crime.

14:50.210 --> 14:51.746
You can at least tell me how I did.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.911
Your lack of _an emotional reaction
at seeing the carnage

14:53.920 --> 14:55.569
leads me to believe you're innocent.

14:55.580 --> 14:57.116
A guilty man would have feigned disgust?

14:57.120 --> 14:59.202
-Exactly.
-You know what counting coup is?

14:59.210 --> 15:00.450
No.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.372
The Apache knew they could
easily prove their superiority

15:03.380 --> 15:05.610
by killing many of the enemy tribe.

15:05.620 --> 15:08.999
But they also knew killings would start
a fierce blood feud which would result

15:09.000 --> 15:11.707
-in the waste of lives and resources.
-Makes sense.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.827
So the Apache proved their superiority
by counting coup,

15:14.830 --> 15:17.879
stealthily stealing property,
usually horses,

15:17.880 --> 15:20.110
from right under the nose of their enemy.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.204
To the Apache, killing,
unless absolutely necessary,

15:24.210 --> 15:26.917
was a sign of stupidity and weakness.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.992
If this is your way of saying you're
not the killer, we already know that.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.161
So why am I still talking to you?

15:32.420 --> 15:34.957
Hotch.
So, if there was another girl out there,

15:34.960 --> 15:36.575
no one's reported her missing.

15:36.580 --> 15:38.821
None of the papers have received
any claims of responsibility

15:38.830 --> 15:41.162
or ransom demands.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.873
We'd like for you to stay and help
with the profile briefing.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.452
If it'll keep the FBI
off the reservation, I'll stay.

15:49.210 --> 15:52.247
Each torture rit_ual_ had
speCIfic religious Significance,

15:52.250 --> 15:54.411
but only to the tribe that practiced it.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.571
It's highly unlikely that any one tribe
would mix them all together like this.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.571
-Meaning?
-Whoever did this obviously had

15:59.580 --> 16:00.820
knowledge of Native American culture,

16:00.830 --> 16:03.913
but they had absolutely no
practical understanding of it.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.957
What we know is this pack shares
a singular vision.

16:07.290 --> 16:12.114
Whether they share a religious faith,
racist ideology, or political manifesto

16:12.120 --> 16:13.200
each member of this unit

16:13.210 --> 16:15.826
has surrendered its individual identity
to the group.

16:15.830 --> 16:19.209
It's the act of kidnapping
that reveals the nature of this pack.

16:19.210 --> 16:23.112
From the German Red Brigade, to the
Munich Olympics, to Iraqi insurgents,

16:23.120 --> 16:26.533
the act of kidnapping is a characteristic
of political terrorist groups.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.872
We could be looking for
a domestic terrorist organization

16:28.880 --> 16:31.952
like the Symbionese Liberation Army
that kidnapped Patty Hearst.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.916
But these are Indians, right?

16:33.920 --> 16:35.319
I seriously doubt it.

16:35.330 --> 16:38.993
The torture and mutilation you see here
are very confused imitations

16:39.000 --> 16:41.958
of warfare practiced by
Native American tribes.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.871
You trying to tell us
that Indians wouldn't be so brutal?

16:43.880 --> 16:45.074
No.

16:45.080 --> 16:48.117
I'm saying that Indians
wouldn't be so confused.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.531
Can we really be sure he's right?

16:52.540 --> 16:54.701
Well, I'm fairly certain
Blackwolf wasn't in on it.

16:54.710 --> 16:57.372
But you don't need to be Einstein
to realize these people were Indians,

16:57.380 --> 16:58.950
or they were people
who made it look like Indians.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.825
Why would anyone
want to frame these Indians?

17:00.830 --> 17:03.458
Possibly to turn public opinion
against them.

17:03.460 --> 17:06.247
Sheriff, you mentioned the Apache
were fighting the land grab in court.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.320
Public opinion
would be a significant factor.

17:08.330 --> 17:11.413
Is there anyone besides the developers
who might be vehemently opposed

17:11.420 --> 17:13.991
-to the Indians getting the land back?
-The ADU.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.537
-Who's that?
-The American Defence Union.

17:16.540 --> 17:19.498
Founded by a local businessman
named Roy Minton.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.206
They're like the Minutemen
who patrol the borders.

17:21.210 --> 17:23.201
Only these guys blame everything
on the Indians.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.418
_ -Who are the members? _
-Minton's people are mostly white,

17:26.420 --> 17:28.911
construction workers,
building supply vendors,

17:28.920 --> 17:30.456
working class people that believe

17:30.460 --> 17:33.577
Indians are standing in the way
of progress and commerce.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.071
Whether they feel the Indians
are standing in the way of progress,

17:36.080 --> 17:38.412
or profit or they're just genuine racists.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.877
I think Minton and the ADU
are strong suspects.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.529
Let's bring Minton in.

17:43.420 --> 17:46.287
Mr. Minton, any idea
who might be behind these killings?

17:46.290 --> 17:48.110
The Indians have
a history of violent behavior,

17:49.960 --> 17:52.451
Did you know
that they used to kill white settlers?

17:52.460 --> 17:54.109
Decapitate the bodies.

17:54.120 --> 17:57.032
Put their victim's heads on
wooden pikes outSIde their houses?

17:57.040 --> 18:00.532
That was a long time ago.
You still seem pretty upset about it.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.076
That was the other night.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.288
My family has been dealing with
the Apache for 150 years.

18:05.290 --> 18:08.828
You know, your rhetoric sounds
just hateful enough to justify violence.

18:08.830 --> 18:12.322
We don't need to stoop to their level.
We're fighting the Indians in court.

18:12.330 --> 18:14.662
Is that right

18:14.670 --> 18:18.822
Our records show that your
200 members carry over 450 firearms.

18:18.830 --> 18:21.071
We're simply exercising
our constitutional right

18:21.080 --> 18:22.820
under the second amendment.

18:23.830 --> 18:27.243
-We have the right to defend ourselves.
-450 guns, Roy.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.490
I don't think so.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.616
That's not self-defence.
That's plain paranoid.

18:30.620 --> 18:31.826
Not anymore.

18:35.210 --> 18:38.532
If Minton's as fanatical as he pretends
to be, he wouldn't file lawsuits.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.371
Or organize labor unions.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.826
The Indians are keeping
Minton and the members of the ADU

18:42.830 --> 18:45.287
from making a lot of money on
the development and construction

18:45.290 --> 18:47.781
-of the Apache land.
-I agree.

18:47.790 --> 18:50.827
He's using racist ideology
to cover simple greed.

18:51.210 --> 18:53.576
Sheriff, I'd like you to put Minton
under surveillance.

18:53.580 --> 18:55.207
-You think he's guilty?
-Not likely,

18:55.210 --> 18:58.282
but we've just given Minton reason
to believe that some faction of the ADU

18:58.290 --> 19:01.612
may have taken matters into their own
hands and Minton may lead us to them.

19:04.540 --> 19:07.282
It's Garcia. Hey. What do you got?

19:07.290 --> 19:10.111
I have a NCIC hit on one of the prints
from the sliding glass door.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.701
Ingrid Greisen, 19 years old.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.871
Family moved her two years ago from Texas

19:13.880 --> 19:16.667
where they require fingerprints
for driver's licence applications.

19:16.670 --> 19:18.319
She wasn't among the victims on the scene.

19:18.330 --> 19:19.991
Okay. Nice job.

19:20.540 --> 19:23.077
Think we might have found
our sixth victim.

19:23.670 --> 19:26.377
How old was Ingrid
when your wife passed away?

19:26.380 --> 19:30.032
-Fourteen.
-And then you raised her on your own?

19:30.040 --> 19:33.532
Why didn't you report your daughter
as missing, Mr. Greisen?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.531
I didn't know she was missing.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.610
She has her own place.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.918
She has her own life at school.
Her own friends.

19:39.920 --> 19:43.788
-When was the last time you spoke?
-A couple weeks ago.

19:45.620 --> 19:48.373
She's been going through a phase
the past couple months.

19:48.380 --> 19:51.167
-Distancing herself.
-Has anyone threatened Ingrid?

19:51.170 --> 19:52.319
Not that I know of.

19:52.330 --> 19:54.321
Have you received any menacing phone calls

19:54.330 --> 19:56.036
or seen anyone in the neighborhood?

19:56.040 --> 19:58.201
I mean, anything that's been
unusual at all?

19:58.210 --> 20:00.417
-No. Nothing like that.
-We have reason to believe

20:00.420 --> 20:03.162
the people who kidnapped your
daughter may be politically motivated.

20:03.170 --> 20:04.376
They killed those kids

20:04.380 --> 20:06.701
and they kidnapped Ingrid
in the name of their cause.

20:06.710 --> 20:08.826
We think the first thing,
well, the best thing,

20:08.830 --> 20:11.993
you can do to help your daughter
is for you to go on the news.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.319
How will that help Ingrid?

20:13.330 --> 20:16.879
If we can personalize Ingrid to the
public, the public will take any harm

20:16.880 --> 20:19.917
that comes to her at the hands
of the kidnappers personally.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.491
Hurting her would hurt their cause.

20:23.460 --> 20:26.247
-It will stop them from killing her?
-It might.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.035
Okay.

20:34.420 --> 20:35.455
Hey.

20:35.750 --> 20:36.785
So?

20:37.170 --> 20:39.661
Fathers' blame themselves
when their child is kidnapped.

20:39.670 --> 20:43.071
As irrational as it is, it's typical.
This guy didn't do that. Why not?

20:43.080 --> 20:44.286
Well, in these situations,

20:44.290 --> 20:46.997
innocent parents,
they don't hide their feelings of guilt,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.661
while guilty parents do.

20:48.670 --> 20:51.662
-So we're thinking this guy's guilty?
-Of something.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.741
Ingrid is my only child.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.570
She's my whole life.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.378
Please, return Ingrid to me.

21:03.170 --> 21:06.162
Talk to her,
and you'll see she's a sweet child.

21:06.170 --> 21:09.662
-She's never hurt anyone in her |ife.-You have to see this.

21:09.670 --> 21:11.820
Anything you need.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.570
Contact me directly.

21:13.580 --> 21:15.571
-I will try...
-What do we do?

21:15.580 --> 21:17.787
...everything I can to help.

21:17.790 --> 21:20.111
-We get rid of her.-Whatever it takes.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.110
I'm asking you, please, let her go.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.076
We've got a caller on the line.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.207
Has Greisen been prepped?

21:28.210 --> 21:30.166
The caller doesn't want to speak
to Greisen.

21:30.170 --> 21:33.992
In fact, he doesn't want Greisen
to know that he's even calling.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.077
This is Special Agent Aaron Hotchner.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.786
Yeah. We have Ingrid Greisen.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.668
W_e'l|_ turn ourselves _ _
and the girl in under one condition.

21:44.670 --> 21:45.876
I'm listening.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.115
You don't tell Greisen about it.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.953
What does it matter to you
what I tell Greisen?

21:50.960 --> 21:53.076
Because he paid us to kidnap her.

22:08.830 --> 22:10.570
-Don't move!
-Hey, don't shoot.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.821
-Where's the girl?
-She's in the van.

22:15.170 --> 22:20.449
Got her! Ingrid, my name is Elle.
I'm with the FBI.

22:22.330 --> 22:24.036
Are you okay?

22:25.040 --> 22:26.826
Just tell me what happened.

22:27.250 --> 22:28.820
Peter Greisen hired us.

22:28.830 --> 22:31.412
He knew about our records,
but he said he'd give us a chance.

22:31.420 --> 22:33.706
Two weeks ago he calls us into his office.

22:33.710 --> 22:35.871
He said he had some
off-the-clock work for us.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.031
-What kind of work?
-He said his daughter was in trouble.

22:39.040 --> 22:43.158
He said he wanted us to follow her,
grab her and take her to the motel.

22:43.170 --> 22:45.877
-You didn't question his motives?
-We... Well, of course we did,

22:45.880 --> 22:48.075
but then he gave us half the money.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.822
And he said if we harmed her
accidental or otherwise

22:50.830 --> 22:52.206
he'd make sure we'd pay for it.

22:52.210 --> 22:54.030
So, he wanted you to kidnap her,
but not hurt her?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.200
Yeah.

22:55.210 --> 22:57.246
So we grabbed her, took her to the motel

22:57.250 --> 23:00.879
and we called Greisen and he said
he'd come by in the morning,

23:00.880 --> 23:03.246
-but he didn't show.
-What about the killings?

23:03.250 --> 23:05.411
We didn't know anything about that. Huh?

23:05.420 --> 23:07.206
We saw it on the news the next morning.

23:07.210 --> 23:09.531
We called Mr. Greisen, he said hold tight,

23:09.540 --> 23:11.576
he'd come around in the afternoon,
but he didn't show,

23:11.580 --> 23:14.117
so then the next night he's on the news.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.578
And he's talking about kidnappers and...

23:18.120 --> 23:22.284
Look, man, we may be dumb, all right,

23:22.290 --> 23:24.417
but we're not stupid.
I made the call right then.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.956
You kidnapped the girl,

23:25.960 --> 23:28.997
but then you leave just minutes before
someone else comes

23:29.000 --> 23:32.208
-and kills those kids?
-We didn't kill them kids.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.532
We was with her the whole time since.
You can ask her.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.997
Well, that's quite the story.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.321
The thing is they're telling exactly
the same one.

23:40.330 --> 23:42.070
I believe it's the truth.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.281
Why'd you kidnap your own daughter?

23:52.290 --> 23:55.532
You kidnapped your daughter
and coincidently saved her life?

23:55.540 --> 23:56.780
Right now, at the very least,

23:56.790 --> 23:58.781
it looks like you had prior knowledge
of the killings

23:58.790 --> 24:00.530
-and, at worst...
-I had nothing to do with the murders.

24:00.540 --> 24:04.169
You paid Leland and Van Owen
to kidnap Ingrid.

24:04.170 --> 24:05.569
-Why?
-I want my phone call.

24:05.580 --> 24:08.322
If what you're saying is true, it seems
likely your daughter was somehow

24:08.330 --> 24:10.821
-invo|ved in these killings.
-She had nothing to do with it.

24:10.830 --> 24:13.708
You stay the hell away from her!

24:14.250 --> 24:16.457
I want the names of all
your daughter's friends at school.

24:16.460 --> 24:19.452
-Boyfriends. I want her class schedule.
-Ingrid's very private.

24:19.460 --> 24:22.031
We have five dead kids.
Tortured, mutilated, and murdered.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.031
And all we have to go on is you
and your daughter.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.416
Do the math.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.456
It's Garcia.

24:30.790 --> 24:31.950
I got this.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.575
-You sure?
-Yeah. Yeah.

24:33.580 --> 24:34.706
Okay.

24:34.710 --> 24:37.326
Yeah. Talk to me.

24:37.330 --> 24:39.958
Okay. Okay.

24:47.460 --> 24:51.078
Hello, Ingrid. I'm Dr. Spencer Reid.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.913
I'm with the FBI
and I was wondering if you could...

24:53.920 --> 24:58.038
Greisen, Ingrid. 943239487.

24:59.210 --> 25:00.325
Excuse me?

25:00.880 --> 25:07.570
Greisen, Ingrid. 943239487.

25:17.290 --> 25:20.532
Doesn't look like Minton
or the ADU are part of it.

25:20.540 --> 25:22.952
My men have been looking at him
and his friends,

25:22.960 --> 25:25.076
checking on alibis. Nothing.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.575
The only thing I'm certain of
is that Peter Greisen

25:27.580 --> 25:29.161
was trying to protect his daughter.

25:31.540 --> 25:34.282
_ _ -Hotchner.
-Ingrid isn't catatonic anymore,

25:34.290 --> 25:35.700
but she's answering every question

25:35.710 --> 25:37.666
with only her name
and Social Security number.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.376
Like a prisoner of war.

25:39.380 --> 25:41.416
There's more. Garcia did some checking.

25:41.420 --> 25:44.662
Ingrid hasn't been enrolled in school
for over a year.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.069
She had good grades.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.459
Just suddenly dropped out
and vacated her campus apartment.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.200
She left no forwarding, Hotch.

25:51.210 --> 25:53.166
We have no idea where
or how she's been liVing.

25:53.170 --> 25:54.205
Thanks.

25:55.710 --> 25:58.372
I need to see Peter Greisen's
phone records.

26:01.540 --> 26:04.168
How long has your daughter been in a cult?

26:06.830 --> 26:10.573
Unit four, I'm still on a code six
outside the Minton residence.

26:10.580 --> 26:12.536
Looks like everyone's gone to bed. Over.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.280
Ten-four, unit 81.

26:43.540 --> 26:45.872
About a month ago you placed a call
to a psychiatrist

26:45.880 --> 26:48.280
in Boulder named Dr. Richard Frank.

26:48.290 --> 26:49.609
He's a deprogrammer,

26:49.620 --> 26:52.202
and his speciality is getting kids
out of cults.

26:52.210 --> 26:55.168
Your daughter joined a dangerous cult
and you couldn't convince her to leave.

26:55.170 --> 26:56.785
So you had her kidnapped.

26:56.790 --> 26:58.371
Now you're protecting her
because you think

26:58.380 --> 27:00.780
Ingrid and her cult killed those kids
and you're probably right.

27:00.790 --> 27:03.418
There's been another killing.

27:03.750 --> 27:06.116
A family of five was slaughtered
in exactly the same way

27:06.120 --> 27:07.200
as the Terra Mesa killings.

27:07.210 --> 27:10.702
And among the dead are three girls.
Ages five, eight, and eleven.

27:10.710 --> 27:12.109
Legally, this could go a long way

27:12.120 --> 27:14.418
in distancing your daughter
from the others.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.785
If Ingrid had a change of heart

27:15.790 --> 27:18.827
a case could be made for brainwashing
or even temporary insanity.

27:18.830 --> 27:23.039
Mr. Greisen, we need you to tell us
what you know about Ingrid's situation.

27:25.750 --> 27:27.570
It's all my fault.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.323
Ever since her mother died,
I've done everything I could for her,

27:32.330 --> 27:34.707
but somehow I left her
vulnerable to these people.

27:34.710 --> 27:37.452
Given the wrong circumstances,
this could happen to anyone's child.

27:37.460 --> 27:39.371
Tell us what happened.

27:40.710 --> 27:42.871
Ingrid was in her first semester.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.326
She started acting strange.

27:48.540 --> 27:54.570
She hardly visited anymore.
But when she did, she was different.

27:54.580 --> 27:57.538
-How -The way she spoke.

27:57.540 --> 28:00.782
She kept repeating these words,
this jargon.

28:01.420 --> 28:04.071
I didn't know where she was getting it.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.957
Then she just disappeared.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.666
Cults commonly have their own language.

28:07.670 --> 28:11.663
They invent or redefine certain words
only the cult members understand.

28:11.670 --> 28:13.956
It's a way of isolating
the members from outsiders.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.030
It is a very powerful form
of thought control.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.577
If you could help us identify
some of the key words,

28:18.580 --> 28:20.536
perhaps we could get Ingrid talking.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.168
She said I was a "trespasser."

28:25.170 --> 28:28.242
-That I had no right to be here.
-In New Mexico?

28:28.250 --> 28:31.538
In the desert. She said "Grandfather"

28:31.920 --> 28:34.992
taught her the ways of...
What was the word?

28:35.380 --> 28:37.666
-Gahee. Ganjees. Something.
-The Gahe?

28:37.670 --> 28:38.739
Yes.

28:39.790 --> 28:41.496
-That's right.
-Thank you.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.240
We're looking for the cult leader.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.571
Typically men between the age 25 and 35

28:45.580 --> 28:47.491
with a high level of intelligence.

28:47.500 --> 28:51.038
A sociopathic underachiever with
an extremely abusive childhood.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.780
And obviously someone with an interest in,

28:52.790 --> 28:55.668
and an affinity for Apache culture
and rituals.

28:55.670 --> 28:58.571
Look for males with criminal records
for lesser type crimes.

28:58.580 --> 29:00.662
Drug possession, petty theft.

29:00.670 --> 29:02.991
What about school records?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.491
The victims from the first crime scene
went to Terra Mesa Univer5ity?

29:05.500 --> 29:07.991
-Maybe the leader was there, too.
-That's great.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.912
Look for students who studied
Native American cultures extensively.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.035
We need to do it all.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.576
With this second strike
it could be a spree.

29:26.830 --> 29:29.879
-Sorry about your man, Jim.
-I appreciate that.

29:30.380 --> 29:31.529
That her?

29:31.540 --> 29:33.917
She won't give us anything,
but her name and her Social.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.035
Thanks.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.247
Okay. They're ready. Everybody out.

29:42.460 --> 29:43.779
Come with me.

29:43.790 --> 29:46.111
My friend wants to show you something.

29:49.460 --> 29:52.577
-Ingrid, my name is John Blackwolf.
-I know who you are.

29:52.580 --> 29:56.664
You are the son of Benjamin BlacloNolf
of the Chiricahua Apache.

29:57.420 --> 29:58.660
Come with me.

30:19.170 --> 30:21.411
What do think happened here, Ingrid?

30:29.750 --> 30:33.413
I think three little trespassers
met the vengeful blade of the tribe.

30:33.420 --> 30:36.036
-What tribe would that be?
-There are only two people.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.747
The Apache,
and those who trespass against us.

30:38.750 --> 30:42.288
-You're not Apache, Ingrid.
-No. You are not Apache.

30:42.290 --> 30:44.997
Not anymore. Grandfather tested me.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.958
He sent me to the desert mountains
to be blessed by the Gahe.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.167
The Gahe have brought
Grandfather back to us,

30:50.170 --> 30:54.118
build his new tribe to reclaim
the sacred land for the Apache.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.280
Where is Grandfather?

30:55.290 --> 30:59.408
Did Grandfather ever tell you
where the name "Apache" comes from?

30:59.420 --> 31:03.743
It comes from the Zuni word "apachu,"
it means enemy.

31:03.750 --> 31:07.413
And if Grandfather knew
the first thing about the real Apache

31:07.420 --> 31:11.993
he would have taught you to refer to us
as the "dene." It means, "the people."

31:12.000 --> 31:14.662
Grandfather said that you
and all the living Apache

31:14.670 --> 31:17.537
are like the Jews of old,
lost and wandering the desert

31:17.540 --> 31:19.280
in search of their Messiah.

31:19.290 --> 31:22.032
-And he has come...
-The dene don't believe in a Messiah.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.530
-You were lied to, Ingrid.
-The Gahe...

31:23.540 --> 31:25.872
Don't use a word you don't understand.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.825
The Gahe are not magic fairies.

31:27.830 --> 31:30.879
They are not gods as you understand them.

31:32.330 --> 31:35.163
This is not the blood of an enemy!

31:35.170 --> 31:39.118
This is the blood of a little girl
just like you are.

31:39.120 --> 31:43.238
You've been fed bits and pieces
of a culture you don't understand.

31:45.250 --> 31:46.740
-You don't know.
-What we do know

31:46.750 --> 31:47.990
is that you've been manipulated

31:48.000 --> 31:50.491
and exploited
by a very disturbed individual.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.990
You are a liar!

31:52.000 --> 31:54.377
You have disavowed your ancestors.

31:54.380 --> 31:57.611
Only those who dwell in
the dead lands deserve to live!

31:59.580 --> 32:02.287
The dead lands are on
the southern edge of the western tract.

32:02.290 --> 32:04.417
You said cults like this
seek out remote places, yes?

32:04.420 --> 32:05.739
They like to isolate their followers

32:05.750 --> 32:08.412
and give them the freedom to create
their own society.

32:08.420 --> 32:09.910
-Okay, got it.
-Well, it doesn't get any more

32:09.920 --> 32:11.069
remote than the dead lands.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.743
-How big an area is this place?
-About a hundred square miles.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.822
-We need to narrow it down.
-We might just have our cult leader.

32:17.830 --> 32:19.821
This guy named Jackson Cally.

32:19.830 --> 32:21.991
He was expelled from TMU
six months before the others.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.991
-What _for?
-Drug posse55ion. Peyote.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.207
Terra Mesa,
the last in a string of colleges.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.030
He studied religion
and Native American culture

32:28.040 --> 32:31.248
in every school and he was in
a seminar on Native American culture

32:31.250 --> 32:32.490
with Ingrid Greisen.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.286
That's how they know so much about me.

32:34.290 --> 32:37.168
I've been a guest lecturer in that
seminar for the past four years.

32:37.170 --> 32:39.206
If Cally's our cult leader
we need more information on him.

32:39.210 --> 32:41.531
Have Garcia pull every shred of
Cally's life out of the system.

32:41.540 --> 32:43.576
-She's already pulling.
-Do we know he's still in the area?

32:43.580 --> 32:46.071
He was arrested for trespassing
on a bunch of motel properties.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.240
Breaking into unoccupied rooms,

32:47.250 --> 32:49.491
but his last known address turned up cold.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.572
Most cults don't have any
legitimate means of paying rent.

32:52.580 --> 32:55.117
They tend to seek out abandoned
previously standing structures.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.917
-Like Manson's Spahn ranch.
-Yeah.

32:56.920 --> 32:58.615
There's an abandoned motel off route 29

32:58.620 --> 33:01.498
-right in the middle of the dead lands.
-Let's go.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.821
I'll stay with Reid.
We'll pull as much as we can on Cally.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.241
FBI! Don't move!

33:37.790 --> 33:41.248
Put your hands out to the side
and turn around very slowly.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.530
Jackson Cally?

33:46.120 --> 33:47.326
Grandfather?

33:49.790 --> 33:51.872
There's no one else here, Hotch.

33:53.380 --> 33:54.916
Where are the others?

33:57.210 --> 33:58.245
Hunﬁng.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.663
Jackson Gordon Cally, 32 years old.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.742
Spent most of his childhood moving
from foster home to foster home.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.206
Hang on a second.
I'm going to put you on speaker.

34:14.540 --> 34:15.666
Go ahead, Reid.

34:15.670 --> 34:17.786
Simply another sad,
but unremarkable statistic

34:17.790 --> 34:20.827
aside from the fact that
he had an IQ of 189.

34:20.830 --> 34:23.492
-Any criminal record?
-At 18 he spent 22 months

34:23.500 --> 34:24.876
in prison for auto theft.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.416
I just spoke to the warden at the prison.

34:26.420 --> 34:28.115
Said when he was there he found religion

34:28.120 --> 34:30.202
and began preaching to his fellow inmates.

34:30.210 --> 34:32.417
And that he once convinced_
a mass murderer he was d0ing time

34:32.420 --> 34:33.614
with to beat to death

34:33.620 --> 34:35.110
an inmate that was threatening Cally.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.918
Ever since he was a child,
this guy just survived on cunning,

34:37.920 --> 34:40.821
-force of personality.
-He spent 22 months in the clink.

34:40.830 --> 34:43.742
Was released and then_bounced
from univerSIty to univerSIty

34:43.750 --> 34:46.321
studying, you guessed it,
Native American cultures.

34:46.330 --> 34:47.786
Okay, thanks.

34:47.790 --> 34:49.951
What's his connection to the Apache?

34:49.960 --> 34:52.827
Aside from taking your class?
Nothing that they could find.

34:52.830 --> 34:54.878
With sociopaths like Cally,
there is no connection.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.075
If it hadn't been Apache
he would've found some other culture

34:57.080 --> 34:58.911
to attract and manipulate his followers.

34:58.920 --> 35:02.321
Like Manson, Cally's been forced to
become an expert profiler of sorts.

35:02.330 --> 35:03.490
He reads the people around him.

35:03.500 --> 35:06.788
He finds a way in, and then he
brainwashes them to serve his needs.

35:06.790 --> 35:09.031
And the only way to figure out
his game is to play it.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.996
I'm going to give him exactly
what he wants.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.911
-What's_that?
-An audience.

35:20.210 --> 35:23.452
Mr. Cally, I'm Special Agent
Aaron Hotchner with the FBI.

35:24.380 --> 35:28.578
You know, I've spent my whole life
talking to cops and doctors.

35:30.750 --> 35:35.198
There's something different about you.
You're not just a cop. Are you?

35:35.540 --> 35:37.201
You're very perceptive.

35:37.830 --> 35:38.990
So what are you?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.991
I'm a profiler.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.240
So am I.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.950
Your colleagues respect you a great deal.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.372
Looking at you to find all the answers.

35:47.380 --> 35:49.530
Leadership is a grave responsibility.

35:49.540 --> 35:51.417
Well, they don't call me Grandfather.

35:51.420 --> 35:54.742
Well, in my tribe, Grandfather is simply
another word for "teacher."

35:54.750 --> 35:56.786
Did you teach your tribe to murder?

35:56.790 --> 35:59.167
No, I don't teach murder. I teach love.

35:59.500 --> 36:03.379
Love of land. Love of ancestors.
Love of the tribe.

36:03.380 --> 36:05.530
These trespassers poison the land.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.371
The Apache will soon remember who they are

36:07.380 --> 36:09.701
and they will hunt these trespassers
off their land

36:09.710 --> 36:12.201
until no one but the Apache remain.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.913
but you're nothing,
but a coward and a killer.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.536
I haven't killed anyone.

36:23.210 --> 36:26.282
Do you think that your little tribe
is going to wage a war

36:26.290 --> 36:29.748
-with all the white people in this state?
-Pretty soon, we won't have to.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.206
-Why's that?
-What's going to happen

36:31.210 --> 36:33.166
when the angry white men come to the doors

36:33.170 --> 36:36.378
of your children blaming you
for the killing of their people?

36:36.380 --> 36:38.666
What are you going to do

36:38.670 --> 36:40.661
No. You're going to string them up.

36:40.670 --> 36:43.992
You're going to put their heads
on poles and rape their women

36:44.000 --> 36:46.707
just like the savage animal
you really are.

36:46.710 --> 36:50.328
Like the savage animal your father was
before they shot him down.

36:50.750 --> 36:51.990
No, Blackwolf.

36:54.330 --> 36:57.458
-Enough!Enough.
-I got it.

37:03.380 --> 37:05.826
Let me in with him, alone.
I'll get him talking.

37:05.830 --> 37:08.071
You've done more
than we could have hoped for.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.616
You guys take Cally down
to the Sheriff's Office.

37:09.620 --> 37:12.953
You tell that man_ he's welcome
on my reservation any time.

37:15.250 --> 37:17.070
I'll give you a ride back.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.611
Blackwolf got Cally to reveal
his true nature. He's a racist.

37:20.620 --> 37:22.531
None of this was
for the sake of the Apache.

37:22.540 --> 37:25.998
Never was. It was always about Cally.
It was about power and manipulation.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.491
Charles Manson claimed that
he ordered his followers to kill whites

37:28.500 --> 37:29.910
in order to initiate a race war.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.706
Something he referred to as
Helter Skelter.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.666
And he believed in the aftermath of
Helter Skelter,

37:33.670 --> 37:36.821
the blacks, who he deemed inferior,
would need a white man to lead them.

37:36.830 --> 37:39.708
There is a large cache of guns missing
from Minton's house.

37:39.710 --> 37:41.701
Why

37:41.710 --> 37:43.917
His whole MO was to fight a war using
the Native American methods.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.320
Maybe he isn't trying to fight a war.
Maybe he's trying to start one.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.616
The first attack was designed
to look like Indians.

37:48.620 --> 37:51.783
In an attempt to manipulate the ADU
to retaliate against the reservation.

37:51.790 --> 37:54.327
But they didn't. How could they?
We had them put under surveillance.

37:54.330 --> 37:57.959
So Cally tried to provoke them further,
by killing the head of the ADU,

37:57.960 --> 38:00.326
-Minton and his family.
-Right, but that didn't work either.

38:00.330 --> 38:02.571
So now he wants to attack the other side.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.492
He's trying to provoke the Indians by
staging an ADU attack against them.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.536
Call Blackwolf.
We need to get to the reservation.

38:07.960 --> 38:09.951
The school's
our most vulnerable target.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.666
Cally likes killing kids.

38:16.710 --> 38:20.612
In '61 Cochise
led his followers to fight...

38:21.170 --> 38:22.990
-Put that away.
-What?

38:24.420 --> 38:26.160
You don't need it.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.031
Use your baton.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.912
There are many paths to the same place.

38:32.580 --> 38:33.990
Trust me.

38:34.670 --> 38:37.616
Just so you know,
you sound like a fortune cookie.

38:59.580 --> 39:01.616
Split up. Find them.

39:41.710 --> 39:43.246
Hold still. Be quiet.

39:58.380 --> 39:59.415
Hey.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.035
Psst.

40:38.710 --> 40:39.995
Big mistake.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.110
Stay down. I don't want to hurt you.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.285
Get down!

41:46.710 --> 41:49.372
-Don't move.
-Don't shoot. I give up.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.661
You okay?

41:53.830 --> 41:56.822
You just had to shoot somebody,
didn't you?

42:13.250 --> 42:14.456
-The children?
-They're fine.

42:14.460 --> 42:16.781
We got them out before they got here.
We took down these four.

42:16.790 --> 42:18.326
Without firing a shot?

42:18.330 --> 42:20.457
Captain America here shot number five.

42:20.460 --> 42:21.745
You're welcome.

42:22.620 --> 42:25.168
Number six is cut up pretty bad.
I don't think he's going to make it.

42:25.170 --> 42:28.742
-At least I didn't shoot him.
-I think I'd rather be shot.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.996
There's an old Apache saying,

42:32.000 --> 42:35.458
"You can take many paths
to get to the same place."

42:50.920 --> 42:53.070
-Be with you in a second.
-Thanks.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.200
What's this?

43:01.210 --> 43:03.201
Paul Norse.
He's in the New York field office.

43:03.210 --> 43:04.746
You ever need anything, give him a call.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.536
He'll take care of you.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.371
This your way of saying
I can't take care of myself?

43:08.380 --> 43:10.826
No, it's my way of saying I'm a jackass.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.116
You know it must be hereditary.

43:17.250 --> 43:21.459
Sean, it's really important
that you do this your way.

43:21.460 --> 43:24.076
You know what you feel is every bit
as important as what you think.

43:24.080 --> 43:29.029
Dad knew that. I forgot.
You reminded me and thanks.

43:31.880 --> 43:35.532
This is a pretty messed up
going away present. You know that?

43:38.540 --> 43:39.780
A brother worries.

43:39.790 --> 43:43.112
-You need to get out of the office more.
-Tell me about it.

43:43.670 --> 43:47.117
-So, I'm starved. How's the food?
-It's pretty good.

43:48.380 --> 43:51.998
-Let me fix you something special.
-I'm in your hands.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.161
-Want a beer?
-Sure. Thanks.
