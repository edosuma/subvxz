We writers
do love our pens.
I had it engraved.

00:14.917 --> 00:17.542
"Y. C. O. M. T."

00:17.542 --> 00:19.041
You Came On My Tits.

00:19.458 --> 00:20.458
(CHUCKLES)

00:21.500 --> 00:22.667
That is true.

00:22.667 --> 00:25.041
Merc and I
went ring shopping.

00:25.041 --> 00:27.333
Oh, my God!
For his wife.

00:27.834 --> 00:29.000
I hope this is okay.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.375
I was just on the lot
dropping something off
at Merc's.

(JAMIE MOANING)

00:34.792 --> 00:36.583
Some woman friend-ed me
on Facebook.

00:36.583 --> 00:38.583
She says she knows you
and needs to
get back in touch.

00:38.583 --> 00:40.083
Oh, shit,
is it Labia?

00:40.083 --> 00:41.458
Is that really
how it's pronounced?

00:41.458 --> 00:42.792
It's not Lahbia
or Labeea?

00:42.792 --> 00:44.542
Nope. Labia.
As in...

00:44.875 --> 00:47.000
Labia, she's my stalker.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.500
You're not serious?
Yeah.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.375
You believe in Bigfoot?
Yep.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.166
Bigfoot!

01:44.166 --> 01:45.750
I'm telling you, there's
too much evidence

01:45.750 --> 01:47.041
for it just to
be a hoax!

01:47.041 --> 01:49.959
Oh, dear God.
Are we including
yeti in this?

01:49.959 --> 01:51.500
No, yeti are bullshit.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.125
Of course.

01:53.125 --> 01:56.083
There was this really
interesting documentary about
it on the Sci Fi Channel.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.917
Always a good source for
factual information.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.166
The Sci Fi Channel's good.

01:59.166 --> 02:00.792
You do know
what the "fi"
stands for?

02:02.458 --> 02:06.709
Anyway,
they had actual footage that
could not be disputed.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.458
Seriously.
They had experts

02:08.458 --> 02:11.250
who examined the film
and they all said,
without question...

02:13.500 --> 02:14.291
Hello?

02:15.625 --> 02:16.959
Don't turn around...

02:17.709 --> 02:19.083
I said don't
turn around!

02:19.542 --> 02:21.041
Why is it
the minute you say
"Don't turn around,"

02:21.041 --> 02:21.875
the first thing
people do...

02:21.875 --> 02:24.250
Okay, okay,
I'm not turning.

02:25.291 --> 02:26.125
Is it Bigfoot?

02:27.834 --> 02:29.291
There's a girl over there,

02:30.417 --> 02:31.291
who keeps looking at me.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.792
Relax. Is she hot?

02:38.750 --> 02:41.083
Pretty hot, yeah.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.333
Looks familiar.
Maybe she's an actress.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.792
I swear to God...

02:48.000 --> 02:50.041
All right,
she's not looking.
Quick, turn around.

02:50.041 --> 02:51.458
But be very nonchalant.

02:53.959 --> 02:55.000
(GROANS)

02:56.000 --> 02:57.250
What the hell
are you doing here?

02:57.250 --> 02:59.917
I said be nonchalant!
That's totally chalant!

03:00.333 --> 03:03.417
Hi.
500 feet, Labia!
500 feet!

03:03.417 --> 03:04.667
Yeah, I don't carry
a tape measure.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.125
Maybe you should!
Oh right,
she's your...

03:07.125 --> 03:08.709
From Facebook.
You're his... Yes.

03:09.166 --> 03:10.750
How did you
even know
I was here?

03:11.333 --> 03:12.542
Have you been
following me again?
No.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.291
He posted it on his page.

03:15.709 --> 03:17.166
I may have
updated my status.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.417
You said you were
gonna un-friend her.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.583
I don't know how.
It's so easy.

03:21.583 --> 03:24.166
You just click on Account and
then you click Edit Friends...

03:24.166 --> 03:27.709
No. No, no, no, you're
not going to become
his IT person.

03:27.709 --> 03:29.166
Now just go.
But I'm still...

03:29.166 --> 03:31.208
Take it with you!
Eat it for dinner!
I don't give a shit.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.041
Just go!
Or I'm gonna call the cops

03:33.041 --> 03:34.041
and you know I'll do it.

03:34.041 --> 03:35.709
Okay, I'm going.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.250
(CHUCKLES)

03:40.291 --> 03:41.500
What?
No. It's just

03:42.709 --> 03:44.667
we haven't been this close
since we were in court.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.500
Go.

03:49.083 --> 03:52.375
I'll, um, I'll just post
how to un-friend me
on your wall.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.667
Thank you.

04:01.792 --> 04:03.208
CAROL: It's our
fifth anniversary,

04:03.208 --> 04:06.333
and there's
no acknowledgment.
None. Nothing.

04:07.375 --> 04:09.041
When you say
anniversary,

04:09.375 --> 04:11.375
what's it the anniversary
of exactly? I mean,

04:12.208 --> 04:16.041
how'd you figure it?
I go from the night
it actually started.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.583
I was at the
People's Choice Awards.

04:19.583 --> 04:22.041
Faith Hill
had just won, like,

04:22.041 --> 04:24.583
favorite hair or something
equally important,

04:24.583 --> 04:27.041
and I just had
to get out of there.

04:27.375 --> 04:29.083
So I snuck outside,

04:29.083 --> 04:31.750
luckily, I happened to have
a joint in my bag.

04:31.750 --> 04:35.000
Put there by the
marijuana elves?
How great would that be?

04:35.250 --> 04:36.250
Anyway,

04:36.750 --> 04:40.417
I light up, and just then,
who walks out.

04:41.709 --> 04:43.166
Merc.
Right.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.417
And I'm like, oh shit,
it's my boss.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.750
But he's totally cool,

04:48.750 --> 04:51.917
and he goes,
"Can I get a hit
off that doobie?"

04:52.667 --> 04:56.417
And I'm like, "Um, yeah,
you can have a hit
off that doobie!"

04:56.959 --> 04:58.959
It's like
Bogart and Bacall.

04:59.959 --> 05:02.917
Anyway, we get
pretty baked.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.959
Then after the show,
we're both waiting
for our cars

05:06.959 --> 05:10.667
and his limo
doesn't show up.
So he turns to me and goes,

05:10.667 --> 05:12.166
"Can I come in yours?"

05:13.625 --> 05:17.125
And I just
look him straight
in the eye.

05:17.458 --> 05:20.333
I still can't believe
I said it and I go,

05:21.208 --> 05:23.291
"Oh, you can
come in mine."

05:23.291 --> 05:25.709
(BOTH GASP)
What?

05:26.333 --> 05:28.333
Not exactly
"You complete me," but...

05:30.291 --> 05:33.417
(GROANS)
It was the best night ever.

05:35.542 --> 05:37.250
But it's been
five years and

05:37.250 --> 05:39.000
where the hell
are we? I mean,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.458
I know that he loves me.
But so what?

05:42.625 --> 05:46.417
I always come second,
it's always on his terms.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.959
And yes, I know,
I know he's married

05:48.959 --> 05:51.333
and she's blind,
and blah, blah, blah,

05:51.333 --> 05:53.291
but so what. You know?

05:54.458 --> 05:56.333
When is it
gonna be my turn?

05:57.166 --> 06:00.709
I just feel like
I'm the only one
making sacrifices here.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.458
(PANTING)

06:04.125 --> 06:05.625
It's fine. It's all good.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.834
It's just a...

06:08.333 --> 06:09.834
It's a little steep.

06:11.291 --> 06:12.875
I come from flat.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.750
It doesn't matter.
Nothing's going to change.

06:21.417 --> 06:24.375
Have you talked to him
about any of this?

06:24.375 --> 06:26.208
He's not so much
with the talking.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.667
And I'm not
so much with the
confrontation. So...

06:31.208 --> 06:33.834
Does he even know
it's your anniversary?

06:34.750 --> 06:36.083
Probably not.

06:36.458 --> 06:39.375
God, I'm so pathetic.

06:40.375 --> 06:41.667
(SIGHS)

06:42.458 --> 06:43.875
Disagree with me!

06:43.875 --> 06:45.667
No, uh...
I'm just saying,

06:46.041 --> 06:50.125
you're in this relationship,
too, you're allowed to
ask for what you want.

06:50.125 --> 06:53.583
You probably won't get it,
but you're allowed to ask.

06:53.917 --> 06:55.333
Maybe.

06:58.041 --> 07:00.041
You want to keep going?

07:00.583 --> 07:01.542
No.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.792
Morning. How was
everyone's weekend?

07:14.083 --> 07:16.792
Fairly uneventful,
except...

07:16.792 --> 07:19.125
Oh, that's right,
I met the infamous Labia!

07:19.125 --> 07:20.125
(GASPS)

07:20.375 --> 07:23.250
You did not! Tell me.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.250
Seems perfectly normal.
Sweet, pretty, young.

07:26.709 --> 07:28.333
Tech-savvy.
Oh yeah,

07:28.792 --> 07:30.125
she's the
girl next door.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.375
If you live on
Crazy Street!

07:33.417 --> 07:35.750
How long has she been
stalking you?

07:35.750 --> 07:38.667
Probably,
hmm... 15 years.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.166
Fifteen years?
Yeah.

07:40.458 --> 07:41.959
I met her
when she was like, eight.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.291
She was one of those
Make-A-Wish kids.

07:44.291 --> 07:45.959
Oh, my God.
What?

07:48.166 --> 07:49.917
Friends
was
her favorite show.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.291
And her one last wish

07:51.583 --> 07:55.625
was she wanted Joey
to take her to Disneyland. So,

07:56.166 --> 07:57.417
I took her to Disneyland.

07:57.417 --> 08:00.291
She was a great kid,
very sweet. But then...

08:02.125 --> 08:03.875
She didn't die.
No!

08:03.875 --> 08:04.917
I know.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.083
Well, look,
don't get me wrong,

08:06.083 --> 08:07.458
it's a great organization,

08:07.458 --> 08:09.458
but they really should
check this stuff out.

08:09.458 --> 08:11.583
I mean, come on,
Make-A-Wish,
do your homework.

08:12.625 --> 08:13.667
So then?

08:16.125 --> 08:19.166
So then she just kept
living and living.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.500
But she was still totally
into me.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.250
Cards and e-mails
and calling all the time.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.125
I was nice about it
at first,

08:26.709 --> 08:29.625
but she started showing up
places I was going to be.

08:29.625 --> 08:30.667
I had to get
a restraining order.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.166
Fifteen years!

08:33.166 --> 08:35.250
You never
encouraged her at all?
Never.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.291
Like I said,
I was nice...

08:38.667 --> 08:39.500
How nice?

08:43.875 --> 08:45.333
I slept with her once.
(GASPS)

08:45.333 --> 08:46.667
Once!
Oh, God.

08:46.667 --> 08:49.333
In retrospect,
probably a bad idea.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.959
But she was 18,
and really cute,

08:52.583 --> 08:54.000
once her hair grew back.

08:56.291 --> 08:57.750
I believe
you will burn in hell.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.291
Ah,
what're you going to do?

09:11.709 --> 09:14.709
I need to talk to you
about something.
Oh, okay.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.583
Do you know
what this weekend is?

09:17.583 --> 09:19.333
Oh, fuck,
it's your birthday.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.166
My birthday is in January.
...anuary.

09:23.041 --> 09:24.417
Never mind.
No, Wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

09:24.417 --> 09:25.709
Come here. I'm sorry.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.750
Talk to me.
What's this weekend?

09:28.875 --> 09:30.000
Our fifth anniversary.

09:31.667 --> 09:33.542
People's Choice Awards.
Yeah.

09:34.417 --> 09:36.750
Five years. Five years.

09:38.291 --> 09:41.625
And I try to be good.
And I try to make it
easy for you.

09:41.625 --> 09:45.417
But I just, I just,
I reach a point
where I feel invisible.

09:45.709 --> 09:49.083
Seriously, sometimes
it's hard to remember
why I'm even in this thing.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.917
(SHUSHING) Okay.
Listen to me.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.917
What?
What if I can get away
this weekend?

09:55.166 --> 09:56.250
What about Jamie?

09:57.208 --> 09:58.625
I don't know.
Let me see what I can do.

09:59.458 --> 10:02.417
Seriously?
Hey, it's our anniversary.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.875
(CHUCKLES) And definitely
not your birthday.

10:07.625 --> 10:08.583
You're really
gonna try?

10:09.250 --> 10:10.375
I really am.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.417
(SIGHS)

10:13.291 --> 10:14.250
Thank you.

10:14.709 --> 10:17.208
Just knowing that
is enough.
Really?

10:18.583 --> 10:20.041
No. It's not enough.

10:20.625 --> 10:22.125
Make it happen.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.417
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

10:32.667 --> 10:35.834
So in about 85 yards
it dog-legs to the right.

10:36.709 --> 10:37.959
Any traps?

10:37.959 --> 10:40.083
Both sides.
So you want to send it
right down the middle.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.083
Nice.

10:45.417 --> 10:46.750
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Sorry. One sec.

10:50.750 --> 10:51.959
Hello?
Hey, babe.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.834
Bad news.
What?

10:54.959 --> 10:56.792
I got to go to New York
this weekend.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.834
No! Why?

10:59.166 --> 11:00.458
The big guns
want to see me.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.291
It can't be good.

11:02.625 --> 11:04.500
But we've got tickets
for the Ahmanson.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.625
And Sunday's
the Lupus Walk.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.834
Aw, shit!

11:09.417 --> 11:11.333
I can't say no
to these guys.

11:11.667 --> 11:14.750
No, I know.
I just wish they'd give you
a little notice.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.417
When do you have to go?
Friday afternoon.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.125
So you're gonna miss
the ballet, too.

11:20.542 --> 11:21.834
No!

11:22.375 --> 11:23.959
Of all the weekends.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.709
It's not your fault.

You know I love
the dirty stuff.
I do.

11:44.709 --> 11:47.375
Wait, I got the boys
this weekend.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.375
No.

Let me call Diane
and see if she can switch.

Oh, God,
wouldn't it be great?

11:52.750 --> 11:56.834
Two whole days,
no sneaking around,
no checking our watches.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.083
We could go away!

11:58.458 --> 12:00.291
Out of town dirty stuff.

12:00.291 --> 12:01.542
Yeah.

12:01.917 --> 12:04.417
There's a foursome coming,
we should let them
play through.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.625
Where are you?
Playing golf.

12:06.625 --> 12:07.875

No, seriously.

12:08.208 --> 12:09.458

Yeah.

where the hole is?

thinking about you.

I love that talking dog show,
it's hysterical.

It's not ours.
Oh.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.000
Stop watching it.
Already did. What's up?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.959
I need something
on short notice.

12:34.959 --> 12:36.083
Uh, how short?

12:36.083 --> 12:37.917
This weekend.
I want Cabo.

12:37.917 --> 12:41.291
I want big, I want view,
I want right on the beach.

I don't care what it costs.

Okay, let me see
what I can do.
Flying out on Friday?

12:46.750 --> 12:49.166
Right.
It's my birthday
on Friday you know.

just called.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.458
What did the Stage say?

13:03.458 --> 13:06.417
They said that Morning
called in sick, and she's
going to be out all week.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.875
How does she know
in advance she's going
to be sick all week?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.917
You don't suppose this
is because her part's
been cut down.

13:13.917 --> 13:15.709
Like what, a silent protest
kind of thing?

13:15.959 --> 13:17.750
It's not impossible.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.625
Could you get her
on the phone for us?
Who?

13:23.667 --> 13:26.125
Who we were just
talking about.

13:26.417 --> 13:28.083
Which part?
What?

13:29.125 --> 13:30.291
I wasn't really listening.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.458
Did you want me
to listen?

13:31.834 --> 13:33.000
That might be helpful.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.750
Okay.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.917
She still doesn't know
who to call, does she?
No.

weekend in Cabo?

want to spend more time
with the boys.

you're supposed
to be with the boys.

trying to rally around her

22:38.250 --> 22:39.792
You... You told Jamie?

22:41.166 --> 22:42.709
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

22:43.417 --> 22:44.333
I'm sorry, I...

22:44.750 --> 22:48.458
Fuck! Fuck you, Bethany!
Fuck you and your
big fucking mouth!

22:48.458 --> 22:52.000
Um, I don't appreciate
being spoken to like that.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.542
Well, then you're
really gonna hate this.

22:53.792 --> 22:58.542
Fuck you! You ruined my
life, you stupid,
cock-sucking, fucking fuck!

22:59.250 --> 23:00.500
(DIAL TONE)

23:01.834 --> 23:03.166
(SIGHS)

23:05.208 --> 23:06.792
MATT: We gotta talk
about last night.

23:07.125 --> 23:08.917
Last night?
Our little moment.

23:08.917 --> 23:10.208
What moment?

23:10.208 --> 23:11.500
Cheek.
Cut!

23:11.500 --> 23:13.667
There was a moment.
No moments.

23:14.041 --> 23:15.333
Cheek.
Cut!

23:15.959 --> 23:17.250
Sorry.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.917
I don't even know
what moment you think
was a moment.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.500
Cheek.
Cut.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.166
(SIGHS)

23:23.625 --> 23:24.625
Cheek.
Cut.

23:24.625 --> 23:26.000
Cheek. Cheek.
Cut.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.333
Cut.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.041
Cut.

23:29.291 --> 23:30.375
(GROANING)

23:31.041 --> 23:33.542
You totally gave me a look!
I did not!

23:33.875 --> 23:35.333
No moment, no look!

23:35.625 --> 23:37.875
Why don't we just
cover her with a sheet?

23:38.375 --> 23:39.583
You know
what it means?

23:39.834 --> 23:42.458
It means there was a look and
it means there was a moment.

23:42.709 --> 23:43.542
Fine.

23:44.083 --> 23:45.750
Fine, whatever.

23:46.625 --> 23:49.458
It's like
Phantom of the Opera
with hair.

23:50.417 --> 23:51.709
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
MATT: Come in.

23:53.750 --> 23:54.542
Hi.

23:55.208 --> 23:56.125
Thank you.

23:56.542 --> 23:59.125
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, thanks a lot, Robin.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.750
Oh, my God.
We're really doing this.
I know. Pretty great.

24:06.917 --> 24:08.291
You ready?
Uh-huh.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.041
Oh, yes, you are.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.583
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

24:13.083 --> 24:15.250
Oh, don't answer it,
let's just go. Don't answer,
don't answer it.

24:15.250 --> 24:16.750
Hello.
Or you can
answer it.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.792
So I guess Bethany
spoiled my
little surprise.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.667
What?
Oh, listen to you,
"What?"

24:22.959 --> 24:24.834
You know I'm taking
you to Napa.

24:24.834 --> 24:28.333
You're what?
She told me you didn't
want Cabo, that's fine.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.583
What happened
to New York?

24:30.959 --> 24:33.250
Oh, like you ever
believed that.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.959
You're taking me
to Napa?

24:35.959 --> 24:36.792
(INAUDIBLE)

24:37.041 --> 24:38.458
Yeah, Napa.

24:38.959 --> 24:40.625
That's how much
I love you.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.333
Oh, God. Yay.

24:44.709 --> 24:45.750
Yay.

24:48.542 --> 24:50.166
Seriously, what the fuck?
I don't know.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.667
Let me find out
what the fuck.

24:53.458 --> 24:54.750
Beverly Hills Travel.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.041
Bethany, hi,
it's Jamie.

24:56.291 --> 25:00.792
Oh, I'm so sorry! He never
told me it was going
to be a surprise.

25:00.792 --> 25:03.083
Don't worry,
it's all fine.
Tell your husband that.

25:03.792 --> 25:06.041
He called me
a cock-sucking
fucking fuck.

25:06.291 --> 25:09.333
Well, he really
hates Napa.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.000
You think?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.667
So, when did he
first call you?

25:13.500 --> 25:16.333
Uh, Monday. I can't remember.
He was talking about Cabo,

25:16.333 --> 25:19.709
and how he wanted to go,
it had to be short notice. And
it didn't matter what it cost.

25:19.709 --> 25:21.542
It's what I thought.
The reservation
wasn't for me.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.500
It's okay, honey,
it wasn't your fault.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.667
Happy birthday,
by the way.

25:27.667 --> 25:28.625
(BETHANY SOBBING)

25:30.792 --> 25:32.000
Shit.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.417
I can't believe it.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.041
I hate your fucking husband.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.667
I know he's your
fucking husband,
but I hate him.

25:37.667 --> 25:38.542
(LAUGHING)

25:38.875 --> 25:39.959
Thank you.

25:40.333 --> 25:42.125
I'm sorry.
No.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.041
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

25:50.125 --> 25:51.417
Thanks, Peter.
Sure.

25:55.041 --> 25:57.333
Ah, I have two more
calls to make,

25:57.333 --> 25:59.709
and then
I'm ready to... No.

26:00.417 --> 26:02.667
No. No.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.375
Yeah.
What?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.375
She found out
about the trip.

26:06.625 --> 26:10.542
I had to make her think
it was for her. Now we're
going to fucking Napa.

26:11.959 --> 26:13.000
Wow!

26:13.875 --> 26:14.834
Perfect.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.834
So, you're celebrating our
fifth anniversary

26:18.291 --> 26:21.709
by taking
your wife to Napa.

26:22.041 --> 26:24.375
Does it help to know
I'm gonna hate
every minute of it?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.208
No. It doesn't help.

26:27.208 --> 26:28.083
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

26:30.166 --> 26:31.542
I can't do this anymore.

26:31.917 --> 26:34.583
Baby...
No. I can't.

26:35.333 --> 26:36.709
No more.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.208
I'm done.

26:44.291 --> 26:46.333
So that's really it?
Seriously?

26:46.333 --> 26:50.208
Yep, I said it
and I meant it.
I deserve better.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.417
Good for you.

26:51.750 --> 26:56.041
It took me five years
to get here, but that's it.
No more. Over and out.

26:58.291 --> 27:00.125
Really?
Probably not.
