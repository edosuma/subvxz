00:23.458 --> 00:25.166
Ahh, hobby day.

00:25.286 --> 00:28.298
It's like taking a regular day and making it a saturday.

00:28.538 --> 00:29.995
But it is saturday, Skipper.

00:30.115 --> 00:31.779
Hmm, it's working already.

00:35.608 --> 00:36.856
Help me, please!

00:41.367 --> 00:43.425
This better be life or death, ringtail,

00:43.545 --> 00:45.571
or we can arrange those stakes.

00:45.691 --> 00:47.214
It's much worse!

00:47.334 --> 00:48.547
My groove!

00:48.875 --> 00:50.802
It is gone!

00:50.922 --> 00:52.926
Your... huh? What?

00:53.046 --> 00:54.941
My groove. my boogie.

00:55.061 --> 00:57.196
My festive fandangoiness.

00:57.316 --> 00:59.079
Are you talking about dancing?

00:59.199 --> 00:59.979
Are you daft?

01:00.099 --> 01:02.125
Hear my words and see my booty.

01:03.220 --> 01:05.935
So you think you can't dance.

01:06.055 --> 01:07.730
Oh, cruel fate.

01:07.850 --> 01:10.424
I remember it like it was yesterday.

01:10.544 --> 01:12.833
Mostly because it was yesterday.

01:13.599 --> 01:15.592
All right, Maurice, hit it!

01:20.519 --> 01:22.599
Are my peoples loving it?

01:23.826 --> 01:24.899
Not really.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.871
look at them, Maurice!

01:35.991 --> 01:38.761
The baboons have stolen my peoples!

01:39.257 --> 01:43.221
That darla is bewitching them with her shaking booty.

01:43.341 --> 01:45.520
Hmm, I know I'm bewitched.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.447
Yes, she is quite good.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.155
But that is no excuse!

01:49.995 --> 01:53.105
So I decided to have a little talk with darla

01:53.225 --> 01:55.732
and explain my feelings.

01:56.302 --> 01:59.148
Ahhh! I've been skunk-bombed!

01:59.499 --> 02:01.491
Whoa, that does stink.

02:03.028 --> 02:04.473
Ah, much better.

02:05.108 --> 02:07.626
Having settled the matter fairly,

02:07.746 --> 02:10.977
I went back to giving the peoples their entertainment.

02:11.787 --> 02:13.298
Look at them, Maurice.

02:13.613 --> 02:17.270
Now it is my quaking booty that is doing the bewitching.

02:17.390 --> 02:19.657
I know I'm bewitched.

02:20.401 --> 02:23.971
But those baboons, they would not listen to sabotage

02:24.091 --> 02:25.263
I mean, reason.

02:29.271 --> 02:32.972
Did you drop that fuzzy bag o' stank into our habitat?

02:33.092 --> 02:35.381
That is a wild accusation!

02:35.501 --> 02:37.833
So y'all saying you didn't do it?

02:37.953 --> 02:38.797
Oh, no, I did it.

02:38.917 --> 02:42.056
I just think the accusation is wild.

02:43.027 --> 02:44.783
Now let me say this slow,

02:44.903 --> 02:47.877
cause I can tell you got a bad case of the stupids.

02:48.524 --> 02:51.666
Maurice!
How did she see the ??? medical report?

02:51.786 --> 02:53.586
You're either gonna to apologize,

02:53.706 --> 02:57.566
or my girls and I are gonna make us a set of lemur coats.

02:57.686 --> 02:59.648
Ohhhh, can I have one?

03:02.836 --> 03:04.255
I cancel my order.

03:04.375 --> 03:08.877
Well, I demand an apology for your demanding of an apology!

03:08.997 --> 03:11.347
So there, miss steals-all-my-peoples!

03:11.652 --> 03:13.982
Now, look, darla, we can work this out.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.749
Forget it, hon. not gonna happen.

03:16.869 --> 03:19.622
Girls, bring me the jar!

03:22.170 --> 03:25.323
You won't dance when I put your groove in this ja

03:25.814 --> 03:29.703
No, you won't prance when I put your groove in this jar.

03:30.375 --> 03:31.952
stand right where you are

03:32.072 --> 03:34.264
while I put your groove in this jar

03:34.384 --> 03:35.981
yes, it's true, my friend

03:36.101 --> 03:37.856
you're never gonna dance again

03:37.976 --> 03:41.856
since I put your groove in this jar

03:42.872 --> 03:46.744
Okay, aside from some terribly substandard singing,

03:46.864 --> 03:47.952
what just happened?

03:48.072 --> 03:49.860
Backwoods magic, that's what.

03:50.140 --> 03:52.961
I put all your "groove" into this jar.

03:53.801 --> 03:57.025
there is no such thing as "backwoods " magic.

03:57.519 --> 03:59.166
The sky spirits told me that.

03:59.286 --> 04:02.109
Oh? Then let's see you dance.

04:02.229 --> 04:05.893
Prepare yourself for the amazement.

04:09.053 --> 04:11.541
Maurice? give me a beat.

04:18.115 --> 04:19.569
Look out now.

04:22.790 --> 04:25.232
So? y'all believe in my magic now?

04:25.777 --> 04:27.057
N-n-n-n-no.

04:28.509 --> 04:32.206
Nooooooooooooo!

04:34.152 --> 04:37.478
So now you are understanding why I am needing your help?

04:37.742 --> 04:39.076
Help me, penguins!

04:39.196 --> 04:43.727
Help me so that my groove may fill my booty once more!

04:44.202 --> 04:47.226
Ah, this is clearly psychosomatic.

04:47.346 --> 04:50.259
You believe your dance skills have been stolen;

04:50.379 --> 04:52.337
therefore you can't shake it.

04:52.457 --> 04:52.917
Right.

04:53.221 --> 04:55.294
It's all in your little head, ringtail.

04:55.414 --> 04:58.238
No, no, no, the groove is not to be in my head.

04:58.358 --> 04:59.875
It is to be in my booty.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.515
But it's not there either.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.387
Look.

05:06.413 --> 05:08.116
Uh, I got your boat out for you.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.586
Got any ideas for this?

05:12.603 --> 05:15.943
Look, darla, can you just give ringtail his groove back?

05:16.063 --> 05:17.566
Well, sure I can, darling.

05:17.686 --> 05:20.114
Yes, thank you. Thank you!

05:20.341 --> 05:21.952
Soon as he apologizes

05:22.072 --> 05:23.919
for skunk-blasting me and my gals!

05:24.039 --> 05:25.345
Oh, I won't do that.

05:25.465 --> 05:27.602
Apologizing is for the weak and wrong,

05:27.722 --> 05:30.876
which is why you should do it to me, because you are weak and wrong.

05:30.996 --> 05:32.359
And you dance badly.

05:32.479 --> 05:34.392
Okay, you may resume negotiating.

05:35.739 --> 05:36.505
Fine.

05:47.349 --> 05:50.359
Phase one: the art of illusion.

05:54.905 --> 05:59.275
Phase two begins when we insert Rico into the hot zone.

05:59.395 --> 06:01.598
With his stunning disguise as cover, ..

06:05.923 --> 06:06.531
Months!

06:07.494 --> 06:08.194
Years!

06:10.359 --> 06:13.197
Then, once he's gained their complete trust,

06:13.317 --> 06:14.597
he'll give the signal.

06:15.378 --> 06:18.269
At that point, we commence phase three:

06:18.389 --> 06:19.999
Aerial onslaught.

06:20.119 --> 06:22.560
That's when the fun begins.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.807
We'll rain flaming righteousness down on those baboons.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.178
Yes, there'll be collateral damage!

06:28.298 --> 06:29.194
Um, excuse me.

06:29.314 --> 06:32.693
Wouldn't it be easier to just sneak into
their habitat and take the jar?

06:32.957 --> 06:34.237
Like I just did?

06:34.357 --> 06:35.056
Well...

06:35.412 --> 06:36.653
Yeah, sure. That...

06:37.087 --> 06:37.998
That could work too.

06:38.118 --> 06:40.520
My groove! Oh, thank you.

06:42.138 --> 06:43.406
Thank you!

06:48.871 --> 06:51.921
Darla, you have saved my groove!

06:52.360 --> 06:53.918
Oh, wait.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.215
You're not giving it back, are you?

06:56.335 --> 06:57.865
Well, that depends.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.475
You ready to say you're sorry?

06:59.595 --> 07:00.531
Depends.

07:00.651 --> 07:03.119
Are you saying you're sorry?

07:04.216 --> 07:06.513
Then I guess that's a big ol' no.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.560
Think you've got all the angles covered,

07:08.680 --> 07:10.117
don't you, baboon?

07:10.237 --> 07:12.137
But you didn't count on this monkey wrench.

07:16.601 --> 07:17.710
Run, Maurice!

07:20.786 --> 07:22.159
I'm flying! I'm fly

07:23.466 --> 07:24.350
I got it!

07:25.929 --> 07:27.275
Rico, catch!

07:56.205 --> 07:58.066
My... my groove.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.835
Kiss it good-bye, honey.

07:59.955 --> 08:02.277
You ain't never dancing again!

08:02.977 --> 08:04.205
N-n-n-no.

08:04.325 --> 08:05.960
Buck up, ringtail.

08:04.325 --> 08:05.960
Buck up, ringtail.

08:08.943 --> 08:09.761
groove?

08:11.939 --> 08:13.009
What the deuce?

08:18.257 --> 08:19.300
That ain't right.

08:19.894 --> 08:21.795
Kowalski, analysis.

08:21.915 --> 08:25.201
Skipper, you seem to be shaking your booty.

08:26.283 --> 08:28.144
Quite impressively, I might add.

08:28.672 --> 08:29.900
But I'm not doing this.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.550
Something's making me dance.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.768
You--you have my groove!

08:34.044 --> 08:36.804
It is not all bye-byed after all!

08:38.912 --> 08:39.678
Get it out of me!

08:39.798 --> 08:40.839
I don't know how.

08:40.958 --> 08:41.828
Guess who does?

08:42.542 --> 08:44.338
Is it Santa?

08:44.458 --> 08:46.344
Ye--what? No!

08:46.464 --> 08:48.052
I'm the only one who can fix this.

08:48.172 --> 08:49.134
But am I gonna?

08:49.254 --> 08:50.547
Santa would.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.606
Well, I ain't santa!

08:52.726 --> 08:55.775
What if Julien apologized?

08:55.895 --> 08:57.696
That's all I'm asking, hon.

08:57.816 --> 09:01.577
Have I not made my policy on apologizing clear?

09:01.697 --> 09:04.111
It is for the weak and wrong!

09:04.231 --> 09:05.313
Listen, ringtail,

09:05.433 --> 09:08.032
I'm about to show you just how weak and wrong you are!

09:08.316 --> 09:09.636
Apologize now!

09:10.705 --> 09:11.524
Okay, then.

09:11.788 --> 09:13.015
Let's dance.

09:18.944 --> 09:22.482
I can't look away from the raw, savage splendor.

09:28.405 --> 09:29.409
I want to cry,

09:29.529 --> 09:32.220
but I don't know if it's because
I've never seen anything so beautiful

09:32.340 --> 09:33.765
Or something so horrific.

09:35.362 --> 09:36.787
I have never...

09:37.936 --> 09:40.695
Wow. Just wow.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.295
Penguin's funny.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.443
Okay, okay, no more.

09:57.918 --> 09:58.868
Mercy!

10:02.525 --> 10:04.743
I, you know, apologize to you.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.142
Groove, move.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.142
What? That's it?

10:11.644 --> 10:12.581
No song?

10:17.404 --> 10:18.104
I think...

10:19.371 --> 10:20.678
Yes, it is!

10:21.893 --> 10:24.137
My grooviness is back!

10:25.206 --> 10:26.724
Thank you, thank you!

10:27.315 --> 10:29.374
Mort, Maurice, come!

10:29.863 --> 10:32.886
We have to play catch up on the lost booty shakes!

10:37.838 --> 10:39.039
I don't get it.

10:39.317 --> 10:42.604
What in the world made me shake my tail feathers like that?

10:42.724 --> 10:44.412
Maybe darla's magic was real.

10:44.532 --> 10:46.234
Don't be ridiculous, Private.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.249
Cold, hard science negates even the possibility of magic.

10:49.369 --> 10:53.078
Okay, then maybe Skipper has a dancer
buried deep inside him.

10:53.579 --> 10:55.111
Magic's real.
Case closed.

10:55.693 --> 10:56.775
But science

10:56.895 --> 10:58.320
Nope, I said case closed.
