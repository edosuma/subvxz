WELL, REMEMBER
THAT THUMB DRIVE

THAT'S A LIE.
WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT.

BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO GET
A DOCTOR'S NOTE.

01:34.833 --> 01:37.140
NO. I ASKED FOR A COUCH,
AND ABBOTT--YOUR BOSS--

01:37.140 --> 01:38.750

YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE IT HERE.

THE RULES.

YES, I DO, AND YOU'VE ALREADY
SEEN THAT I DO.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.983

NEVER BEEN TO A SHRINK?

01:55.071 --> 01:57.334
WHAT ARE YOU ASHAMED OF?

01:57.334 --> 02:00.468
I'M SORRY THAT I DECEIVED YOU,

02:00.468 --> 02:02.252
BUT YOU DIDN'T DECEIVE ME.GOOD.

02:02.252 --> 02:05.255
I'M GLAD YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.344
I DIDN'T INTEND TO GET
SO INVOLVED.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.825
I WAS MEANT
TO CONFIRM YOUR IDENTITY

02:09.825 --> 02:11.522
AND KEEP TABS ON YOU.

02:11.522 --> 02:14.264

TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU

02:23.143 --> 02:25.623
BY BEING AS HONEST
AS POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.364
DO YOU ALWAYS MASK YOUR GUILT
WITH ANGER?

02:28.800 --> 02:31.107
THERE'S NOTHING IN MY LIFE
THAT I'M ASHAMED OF.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.674
BUT IT IS MY LIFE,

02:32.674 --> 02:35.590
AND WHETHER I HAVE BEEN
TO A SHRINK OR I HAVEN'T,

02:35.590 --> 02:37.461

TO BELIEVE A CORPUS CHRISTI

07:19.874 --> 07:21.745
ONCE I PULLED CLEAN PHOTOS

WAS WRONG.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.528
YES.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.661
TO YOU, I MEAN?

20:27.661 --> 20:30.141
YES.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.057
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

20:33.057 --> 20:36.147
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING.

20:40.413 --> 20:43.198
I DIDN'T WANT TO WITHHOLD
INFORMATION,

20:43.198 --> 20:45.113
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
I CAN'T...

20:45.113 --> 20:46.593
GET INVOLVED IN ALL THIS.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.072
AND NOW YOU CAN?

20:48.072 --> 20:52.251
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?
SOMEONE CHANGED MY MIND.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.600
[Cho] WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT PACO PEREZ?

20:53.600 --> 20:57.604
HE HAS A CONDO THAT HE USES
BY THE BEACH.

20:57.604 --> 21:00.346
RICHIE AND I WENT THERE
TO PARTY A COUPLE TIMES.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.651
DO YOU KNOW THE ADDRESS?

21:01.651 --> 21:05.264
OH, YEAH, UH,
2014 OCEAN... SOMETHING.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.918
IT'S--IT'S RIGHT
ON THE WATER.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.790
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT PEREZ?

21:09.790 --> 21:13.010
JUST THAT HE'D PROBABLY KILL ME
IF HE KNEW I WAS TALKING TO YOU.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.882
HAS HE THREATENED YOU
BEFORE?

21:14.882 --> 21:19.365
NO. BUT... HE IS
A VIOLENT MAN.

21:19.365 --> 21:22.498
ARE YOU SURE
THAT THIS IS SAFE?

21:22.498 --> 21:24.065
THAT I'M SAFE?

21:24.065 --> 21:26.067
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT, MS. MARKHAM.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.634
NO ONE OUTSIDE THIS ROOM
WILL EVER FIND OUT

21:27.634 --> 21:28.983
YOU COOPERATED WITH US.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.639
TRUST ME.

21:34.728 --> 21:37.383
[seagulls squawking]

21:37.383 --> 21:39.863
[police radio chatter]

21:39.863 --> 21:42.431
[indistinct conversations]

21:48.872 --> 21:50.483
ANY LUCK?

21:50.483 --> 21:51.875
PEREZ WAS DEFINITELY
LIVING HERE,

21:51.875 --> 21:53.573
BUT NO SIGN OF HIM
WHEN WE ARRIVED.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.226
YOU THINK HE KNEW
WE WERE COMING?

21:55.226 --> 21:56.445
IT'S HARD TO SAY, BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE HE LEFT IN A HURRY.

21:56.445 --> 21:57.794
TV WAS STILL ON.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.101
THE CONDO BUILDING
HAS SECURITY CAMERAS.

22:00.101 --> 22:01.842
SEE IF YOU CAN PULL THE FOOTAGE.
WE MIGHT ABLE TO SEE

22:01.842 --> 22:03.452
WHAT CAR HE WAS DRIVING
OR IF HE LEFT WITH ANYONE.

22:03.452 --> 22:06.499
WE'RE ON IT.ALL RIGHT.

22:06.499 --> 22:09.632
[sighs] ALL RIGHT.
PHONES, COMPUTERS--

22:09.632 --> 22:11.199
ANY SIG INTEL WE CAN USE
TO TRACE PEREZ.

22:11.199 --> 22:13.201
I WANT ALL OF IT.
AND HE HAS A HEAD START,

22:13.201 --> 22:15.029
SO LET'S MOVE.
CLOCK'S TICKING.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.044
THANKS AGAIN FOR THE RIDE.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.828
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.743
CAN I WALK YOU IN?

22:33.743 --> 22:37.660
UH... IF YOU WALK ME IN,
I MIGHT INVITE YOU IN,

22:37.660 --> 22:41.534
AND... WE BOTH KNOW
WHERE THAT WOULD LEAD.

22:41.534 --> 22:44.101
[laughs] OH, YOU'RE TROUBLE.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.755
HARMLESS AS A FLY.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.366
THAT MAKES ME THE SPIDER.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.845
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THAT.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.369
RIGHT AT HOME, I IMAGINE.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.328
NEXT TIME. OKAY?

22:53.328 --> 22:54.503
SO THERE'S A NEXT TIME?

22:54.503 --> 22:58.333
IF YOU WANT,
AND IF YOU CALL ME.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.944
[laughing] YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.730
TOMORROW.
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

23:03.730 --> 23:04.818
GOOD.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.343
[kisses]

23:12.086 --> 23:13.130
BYE.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.175
BYE.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.263
[door closes]

23:24.881 --> 23:26.143
[sighs]

23:26.143 --> 23:28.058
[man] WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

23:37.546 --> 23:39.461
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:39.461 --> 23:41.724
I HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

23:41.724 --> 23:45.336
THE F.B.I. JUST RAIDED
MY PLACE.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.121
OKAY, THAT DOESN'T
ANSWER MY QUESTION.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.602
WHY ARE YOU HERE
IN MY HOUSE?

23:49.602 --> 23:51.647
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHY I AM HERE.

23:51.647 --> 23:54.781
I THINK YOU SENT THE F.B.I.
TO MY CONDO.

23:54.781 --> 23:58.349
I THINK YOU WANTED THEM
TO FIND ME AND TO ARREST ME.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.177
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

24:00.177 --> 24:01.744
ENOUGH!

24:04.921 --> 24:07.924
YOU KNOW WHO I WORK FOR.

24:07.924 --> 24:10.449
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD DO
WHEN THEY FIND OUT

24:10.449 --> 24:12.755
THAT YOU RATTED ME OUT
TO THE FEDS.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.627
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.370
DON'T YOU EVER THREATEN ME,
YOU LITTLE BITCH.

24:19.370 --> 24:21.460
DID YOU FORGET
WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.331
I RUN THIS TOWN.
I'M THE BOSS.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.593
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

24:24.593 --> 24:28.554
[breathing heavily]

24:31.295 --> 24:33.210
NOW...

24:33.210 --> 24:34.647
[exhales]

24:34.647 --> 24:35.996
LET'S START OVER.

24:35.996 --> 24:37.171
[clears throat]

24:37.171 --> 24:38.694
[clicks tongue]

24:38.694 --> 24:40.435
WHY WOULD I TALK
TO THE F.B.I.?

24:40.435 --> 24:42.481
DON'T--DON'T PLAY DUMB!

24:42.481 --> 24:44.613
WITH ME OUT OF THE WAY,
YOU HAVE A STRAIGHT LINE

24:44.613 --> 24:46.572
TO THE ESPEDES CARTEL.

24:46.572 --> 24:49.966
BUT YOU JUST CAN'T
TAKE ME OUT.

24:49.966 --> 24:54.275
OTHERWISE, COLOMBIA? GONE.
YOUR PRODUCT? GONE.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.495
YOU? GONE.

24:56.495 --> 25:00.107
SO THIS LITTLE GAME
YOU ARE PLAYING WITH THE F.B.I.,

25:00.107 --> 25:01.891
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

25:01.891 --> 25:05.939
YES... IT IS.

25:05.939 --> 25:08.811
FIVE D.E.A. AGENTS ARE DEAD,

25:08.811 --> 25:11.858
AND THE F.B.I. THINKS
THAT YOU KILLED THEM.

25:11.858 --> 25:14.034
I MEAN, I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO TOUCH YOU,

25:14.034 --> 25:18.560
BUT WHAT IF I MADE IT LOOK
LIKE SOMEONE ELSE DID?

25:18.560 --> 25:19.953
[gasps]

25:19.953 --> 25:21.824
OH, YOU NEVER THOUGHT
OF THAT?

25:21.824 --> 25:23.870
[exhales]

25:23.870 --> 25:26.568
RELAX! PACO...

25:28.831 --> 25:30.833
UH... [breathes sharply]

25:30.833 --> 25:33.532
IF I WANTED TO KILL YOU...
[chuckles]

25:35.708 --> 25:37.144
YOU'D BE DEAD.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.235
[grunts]

25:42.976 --> 25:44.499
DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA KILL YOU.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.283
NOT TONIGHT, ANYWAY.

26:23.059 --> 26:25.366
[sighs]

26:27.107 --> 26:29.762
[Krystal] I thought you were
gonna call me tomorrow.

26:29.762 --> 26:33.156
IT'S TOMORROW SOMEWHERE.
BALI, I THINK.

26:33.156 --> 26:34.854
IT'S A PROBLEM?

26:34.854 --> 26:38.509
NO. NO PROBLEM.
I'M JUST SURPRISED.

26:38.509 --> 26:41.512
IT HAPPENS SO RARELY
THESE DAYS.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.906
I'm calling because I want
to see you tomorrow.

26:43.906 --> 26:46.430
[grunting]You're free?

26:46.430 --> 26:49.303
MM... I HAVE SOME
ERRANDS TO RUN

26:49.303 --> 26:51.261
AND SOME THINGS
TO TAKE CARE OF,

26:51.261 --> 26:53.524
BUT I SHOULD BE FREE
IN THE EVENING.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.265
IT'S A DATE.

26:58.312 --> 26:59.922
GOOD NIGHT, PATRICK.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.229
GOOD NIGHT, KRYSTAL.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.797
[grunting continues]

27:13.719 --> 27:15.242
WE HAVE A B.O.L.O. OUT
ON PEREZ.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.287
CORPUS CHRISTI P.D.'s GONNA
HELP WITH THE SEARCH.

27:17.287 --> 27:20.421
WHAT'S THIS?SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE
FROM PEREZ'S APARTMENT BUILDING.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.162
YOU GOT ANYTHING?NOT YET.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.642
THE CAMERA ONLY CATCHES
THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING,

27:23.642 --> 27:25.121
SO PEREZ COULD HAVE
COME AND GONE

27:25.121 --> 27:26.775
WITHOUT US EVEN KNOWING
ABOUT IT.

27:26.775 --> 27:29.560
LADIES, QUICK QUESTION. HUH?
WHICH SHIRT DO I WEAR?

27:29.560 --> 27:31.301
JANE, WE'RE KINDA IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

27:31.301 --> 27:34.130
PLEASE, I NEED THE HELP.
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.567
HUH? WHICH ONE?
THIS OR... THIS?

27:38.918 --> 27:40.920
ARE YOU SURE?IT'S--FINE, THAT ONE.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.791
EH...

27:42.791 --> 27:44.140
[mutters]JANE, REALLY? COME ON.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.925
WE'RE TRYING TO TRACK DOWN
PEREZ.

27:45.925 --> 27:47.970
ARE YOU GONNA ACTUALLY HELP WITH
THIS INVESTIGATION, OR WHAT?

27:47.970 --> 27:51.408
WELL, WHO SAYS I'M NOT?OH, YOU'RE HELPING...
BY GOING ON A DATE.

27:51.408 --> 27:52.888
WELL, IT PAID OFF ONCE,
DIDN'T IT?

27:52.888 --> 27:54.237
BY THE WAY, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR THE COUCH.

27:54.237 --> 27:56.892
WARMS THE PLACE UP
TREMENDOUSLY.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.635
HE IS UP TO SOMETHING
WITH THAT WOMAN.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.985
YEAH, I'LL SAY.NO. I MEAN
HE KNOWS SOMETHING

28:02.985 --> 28:04.334
THAT HE'S NOT TELLING US.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.032
I'VE SEEN IT
A THOUSAND TIMES.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.121
I DON'T KNOW. HE SEEMED
PRETTY INTERESTED IN HER.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.427
SHE'S NOT EVEN HIS TYPE.THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.386
WHAT IS HIS TYPE?

28:12.386 --> 28:13.996
I DON'T KNOW.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.345
HMM.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.479
THIS IS A DEAD END.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.916
UH... MAYBE PEREZ
KNEW ABOUT THE CAMERAS.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.702
IT WAS WORTH A TRY.YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.356
AT THE D.E.A.'s OFFICE,
THE GUNMEN KNEW

28:26.356 --> 28:29.316
ABOUT TWO OF THE HIDDEN
SECURITY CAMERAS.RIGHT.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.187
BUT NOT THE THIRD. WHY?

28:31.187 --> 28:32.754
BAD INTEL?

28:32.754 --> 28:35.539
MAYBE, BUT EVEN SO,
WHERE DID THE INTEL COME FROM?

28:35.539 --> 28:37.498
HOW DID THEY FIND OUT ABOUT
THE TWO HIDDEN SECURITY CAMERAS

28:37.498 --> 28:38.847
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

28:38.847 --> 28:40.501
I DON'T KNOW.

28:40.501 --> 28:43.634
BUT I DO KNOW
WHERE WE CAN FIND OUT.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.465
HELLO, PATRICK.

28:48.465 --> 28:51.338
HI. UH, JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE STILL ON FOR TONIGHT.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.949
MMM, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.[car alarm chirps]

28:53.949 --> 28:56.212
UH, DO YOU WANT TO
COME BY THE HOUSE?

28:56.212 --> 28:57.736
LOVE TO. WHAT TIME?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.520
[muffled grunt]LET'S SAY 7:00.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.217
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

29:01.217 --> 29:02.653
BYE.

29:06.179 --> 29:07.484
COMFY?

29:07.484 --> 29:10.357
DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE A SHORT RIDE.

29:10.357 --> 29:12.489
[muffled shout][slams trunk]

29:12.489 --> 29:14.361
SO WHO KNEW ABOUT
THE HIDDEN CAMERAS?

29:14.361 --> 29:15.710
ME.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.581
MY COLLEAGUES.

29:17.581 --> 29:20.584
AND THE GUNMEN.
SOMEBODY TOLD THEM. WHO?

29:20.584 --> 29:22.848
MAYBE SOMEONE FROM
THE CLEANING CREWS.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.763
ONE OF THE TECHS
THAT INSTALLED THE CAMERAS.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.722
DRUG RING COULD HAVE BOUGHT OFF
ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

29:27.722 --> 29:32.509
LOOK, WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT
NO ONE ON MY TEAM WOULD DO THIS.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.294
WHY DON'T YOU PULL UP A SEAT?
IT'S GONNA TAKE A MINUTE.

29:34.294 --> 29:36.818
[clicking mouse]

29:42.606 --> 29:46.045
YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THINGS THROUGH, PACO.

29:46.045 --> 29:48.787
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
SMARTER.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.049
[clicks tongue]

29:50.049 --> 29:54.096
[bag snaps]AHH, BUT THEN...

29:54.096 --> 29:55.881
YOU ARE A MAN.

29:58.753 --> 30:00.494
[woman] Corpus Christi
Police Department.

30:00.494 --> 30:01.930
How can I help you?

30:01.930 --> 30:03.714
YES. I THINK I SAW
THE MAN ON THE NEWS

30:03.714 --> 30:06.326
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR--
PACO PEREZ.

30:06.326 --> 30:07.849
Where did you see him?

30:07.849 --> 30:09.372
UH, HEADING INTO AN EMPTY
HOUSE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

30:09.372 --> 30:10.809
I THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE,

30:10.809 --> 30:12.941
BECAUSE THE HOUSE HAS BEEN
EMPTY FOR MONTHS.

30:12.941 --> 30:15.161
What's the address, ma'am?

30:15.161 --> 30:17.598
945 CLINTON STREET.

30:17.598 --> 30:19.992
I have officers responding.

30:19.992 --> 30:22.298
If you see him, do not
approach him on your own.

30:22.298 --> 30:24.735
Understood?YES, OF COURSE.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.172
What's your name?

30:35.355 --> 30:36.965
SORRY TO HAVE TO RUN.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.968
I WILL KILL YOU.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.970
YOU HEAR ME, BITCH?

30:41.970 --> 30:43.145
I'LL KILL YOU!

30:43.145 --> 30:44.799
[breathing heavily]

30:44.799 --> 30:45.931
GOOD-BYE, PACO.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.280
UHH!

30:50.413 --> 30:52.938
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
JUST...

30:52.938 --> 30:55.114
TEXT ME WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

30:58.247 --> 30:59.292

33:23.958 --> 33:25.307
WHAT'S UP, CHO?

33:25.307 --> 33:27.353
WE FOUND PEREZ. HE'S DEAD.WHAT HAPPENED?

33:27.353 --> 33:29.703
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HE OPENED
FIRE ON CORPUS CHRISTI P.D.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.835
THE OFFICERS FIRED BACK.
THEY HAD MORE GUNS.

33:31.835 --> 33:33.402
DID WE GET ANYTHING
FROM THE SCENE?

33:33.402 --> 33:35.404
A REVOLVER.
ALL SIX ROUNDS WERE FIRED.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.363
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
STRANGE.

33:37.363 --> 33:39.147
I FOUND A BULLET HOLE IN ONE OF
THE WINDOW FRAMES OF THE HOUSE.

33:39.147 --> 33:40.583
SO?

33:40.583 --> 33:42.281
WELL, IT WAS AT THE BACK
OF THE HOUSE,

33:42.281 --> 33:43.847
WHICH MEANS SOMEONE WAS
SHOOTING FROM THE BACKYARD.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.284
I DON'T THINK PEREZ
WAS ALONE.

33:45.284 --> 33:47.242
THANKS.

33:54.510 --> 33:55.598
[taps key]

33:55.598 --> 33:57.122
IS THAT...

33:57.122 --> 33:58.862
KRYSTAL MARKHAM.

33:58.862 --> 34:01.039
HIGGINS HAD SAID HIS COLLEAGUES
HAD INTERVIEWED HER,

34:01.039 --> 34:02.649
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
INTERESTED ME.

34:02.649 --> 34:03.867
WATCH THIS.

34:03.867 --> 34:04.912
[taps keys]

34:08.002 --> 34:12.224
SHE'S LOOKING INTO THE CAMERA,
LIKE SHE KNEW IT WAS THERE.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.790
I THINK SHE DID.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.840
THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.494
IT'S A LITTLE OLD-FASHIONED.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.626
I LOVE THEM.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.848
[clicks tongue]
GO TAKE A SEAT.

34:27.848 --> 34:30.068
I'LL PUT THESE IN WATER.OKAY.

34:36.204 --> 34:38.076
[cell phone rings]

34:38.076 --> 34:40.817
[breathes deeply] HI.

34:40.817 --> 34:42.732
[lowered voice] I AM RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.734
CALL ME BACK A LITTLE LATER.[beeps]

34:44.734 --> 34:46.432
KRYSTAL MARKHAM
IS THE RINGLEADER.

34:46.432 --> 34:47.520
JANE?

34:47.520 --> 34:49.348
DAMN, HE HUNG UP!

34:59.923 --> 35:03.492
I THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE
A DRINK DOWN BY THE WATER.

35:03.492 --> 35:05.712
MY FRIEND HAS A BOAT
HE LETS ME USE.

35:05.712 --> 35:07.627
WHAT DO YOU SAY?SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

35:07.627 --> 35:08.715
ALL RIGHT.

35:25.993 --> 35:29.039
YOUR FRIEND LETS YOU
BORROW THIS?

35:29.039 --> 35:32.782
MM-HMM. HE DOESN'T GET A CHANCE
TO USE IT VERY MUCH ANYMORE.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.001
ISN'T HE GENEROUS?

35:34.001 --> 35:35.611
WOW, SOME FRIEND.

35:35.611 --> 35:37.657
MM.SHOULD I BE JEALOUS?

35:39.093 --> 35:40.877
ALWAYS.

35:40.877 --> 35:41.965
[chuckles]

35:49.190 --> 35:50.583
THANK YOU.[giggles]

36:06.120 --> 36:08.296
[clears throat]

36:08.296 --> 36:09.993
HOW'S YOUR INVESTIGATION
COMING?

36:09.993 --> 36:11.647
OH, WE'VE HAD SOME
BREAKTHROUGHS.

36:11.647 --> 36:13.475
WE FOUND PACO PEREZ,
THANKS TO YOU.

36:13.475 --> 36:16.130
OH? IS HE IN CUSTODY?

36:16.130 --> 36:18.828
NO, UH... DEAD.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.787
CORPUS CHRISTI POLICE
SHOT HIM DEAD.

36:20.787 --> 36:23.311
[pouring wine]WELL, AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
THEY THINK HAPPENED.

36:23.311 --> 36:24.791
AND YOU?

36:24.791 --> 36:27.620
OH, I LIKE TO KEEP
AN OPEN MIND.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.274
I LIKE THAT ABOUT YOU.

36:31.493 --> 36:33.626
[clicks tongue] CHEERS.CHEERS.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.240
NOW THAT PACO IS DEAD,

36:39.240 --> 36:41.155
I IMAGINE YOU'LL BE HEADING
BACK TO AUSTIN.

36:41.155 --> 36:43.070
IN DUE TIME.

36:43.070 --> 36:45.072
YEAH.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.639
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU HERE?

36:46.639 --> 36:48.075
YOU ARE.

36:50.164 --> 36:51.992
[cell phone rings]

36:51.992 --> 36:53.907
SORRY.[laughs]

36:53.907 --> 36:54.995
EXCUSE ME.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.301
SO RUDE.

36:56.301 --> 36:57.824
[rings, stops]

36:57.824 --> 37:00.479
[sighs]

37:00.479 --> 37:01.915
YOU'RE A WANTED MAN.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.438
MAYBE I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE JEALOUS.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.614
IT'S JUST WORK.
NOTHING IMPORTANT.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.790
WELL, PERSONALLY, I HOPE
YOUR INVESTIGATION

37:07.790 --> 37:09.879
DRAGS ON FOR WEEKS.AND WHY IS THAT?

37:09.879 --> 37:12.142
YOU AND I ARE GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

37:12.142 --> 37:16.625
WELL... SADLY, I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA GO ON MUCH LONGER.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.801
I HAVE A NEW THEORY.

37:18.801 --> 37:22.457
CAN YOU SHARE IT WITH ME?SURE. I TRUST YOU.

37:22.457 --> 37:26.200
FIRST THING THAT STUCK OUT
TO ME WAS THAT THE GUNMEN

37:26.200 --> 37:29.551
KNEW OF TWO OF THE HIDDEN
CAMERAS, BUT NOT A THIRD.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.292
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE.

37:31.292 --> 37:33.468
UNLESS, OF COURSE, THE PERSON
THAT SENT THE GUNMEN IN

37:33.468 --> 37:34.817
WANTED THEM TO BE CAUGHT.

37:34.817 --> 37:37.037
CLEVER.YEAH, IT IS.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.604
AND THE SECOND THING?

37:38.604 --> 37:40.432
WELL, IT'S JUST A THEORY,
LIKE I SAID,

37:40.432 --> 37:42.912
BUT THIS MR. X THAT THE D.E.A.
KEEPS TALKING ABOUT--

37:42.912 --> 37:46.394
WE KNOW HE'S DISCIPLINED,
HE'S ORGANIZED, HE'S CAREFUL.

37:46.394 --> 37:47.874
AND SMART.

37:47.874 --> 37:49.528
BUT...

37:49.528 --> 37:52.966
BUT HERE'S A MAN THAT RUNS
THIS HUGE DRUG RING.

37:52.966 --> 37:56.274
AND DOESN'T JUST RUN IT.
HE RUNS IT SEAMLESSLY.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.754
AND YET NO ONE KNOWS
WHO HE IS.

37:58.754 --> 38:01.409
HE'S A MAN THAT'S COMPLETELY
VOID OF EGO.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.193
AND IN ALL MY LIFE,
I DON'T KNOW

38:03.193 --> 38:05.805
THAT I'VE EVER MET A MAN
WHO COULD DO THAT.

38:05.805 --> 38:10.505
A MAN WHO WOULD COMPLETELY
SHUN ALL ATTENTION?

38:10.505 --> 38:12.942
THAT JUST GOT ME THINKING,
AND...

38:12.942 --> 38:16.903
WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
THIS MR. X IS A WOMAN.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.165
[clicks tongue]

38:18.165 --> 38:19.558
THAT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING
THEORY.

38:19.558 --> 38:21.777
YEAH, I THINK SO.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.344
I'M NOT LOVING THIS.
[chuckles]

38:23.344 --> 38:24.780
I THINK I'M GONNA OPEN
ANOTHER BOTTLE.

38:24.780 --> 38:25.868
OH.

38:37.097 --> 38:39.534
[swishing wine]

38:39.534 --> 38:41.710
[swallows] I LIKE IT.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.625
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.975
AND--AND DON'T WORRY
IF YOU CAN'T ANSWER THIS.

38:45.975 --> 38:48.021
I WON'T.

38:48.021 --> 38:49.283
[sets glasses down]

38:49.283 --> 38:52.025
THIS WOMAN--
WHO DO YOU THINK SHE IS?

38:53.461 --> 38:54.897
HMM.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.203
YOU.

38:56.203 --> 38:57.944
[laughs]

38:57.944 --> 38:59.337
[laughs]

38:59.337 --> 39:01.164
[gasps and stops laughing]

39:03.079 --> 39:04.994
[sets bottle down]

39:04.994 --> 39:07.040
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

39:07.040 --> 39:08.607
YOU'RE SMART.

39:08.607 --> 39:12.306
SMART ENOUGH TO LET PEOPLE
THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.743
WHICH IS EXACTLY THE TRAIT

39:14.743 --> 39:17.964
THAT ALLOWED MR. X TO BE
A MYSTERY FOR ALL THESE YEARS.

39:17.964 --> 39:19.531
BESIDES, I KNEW BETTER
THAN TO THINK

39:19.531 --> 39:22.621
THAT YOU WERE INTERESTED
IN ME, BECAUSE...

39:22.621 --> 39:26.146
WELL, YOU WERE INTERESTED
IN ME.

39:27.190 --> 39:28.627
[clicks tongue]

39:28.627 --> 39:30.324
YOU UNDERESTIMATE YOURSELF.

39:30.324 --> 39:31.586
NOT THIS TIME.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.762
WELL, I GUESS
WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

39:33.762 --> 39:35.808
HMM.[chuckles]

39:35.808 --> 39:37.418
A QUESTION--IF I...
[chuckles]

39:37.418 --> 39:39.159
IF I AM SO CAPABLE...MM-HMM.

39:39.159 --> 39:41.596
SO SMART, AS YOU SAY,

39:41.596 --> 39:44.164
HOW DID I END UP HERE?
WHERE DID I GO WRONG?

39:44.164 --> 39:47.733
IT WASN'T ANYTHING YOU DID.
YOU WERE FLAWLESS. REALLY.

39:47.733 --> 39:50.388
[exhales]AND THE WAY YOU SET THE GUNMEN
UP TO BE CAUGHT,

39:50.388 --> 39:53.391
AND KILLING THEM, AND LINKING
THE MURDER TO PEREZ,

39:53.391 --> 39:56.045
AND HAVING PEREZ KILLED
THE WAY YOU DID--

39:56.045 --> 39:57.786
MY PARTICULAR FAVORITE.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.222
I MEAN,
THE CORPUS CHRISTI POLICE

39:59.222 --> 40:01.834
PROBABLY STILL THINK
THAT THEY SHOT HIM.

40:03.749 --> 40:06.578
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT
ONE THING, PATRICK.

40:06.578 --> 40:09.711
I DIDN'T HAVEPACO KILLED.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.452
I SHOT HIM MYSELF.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.585
AH...

40:13.585 --> 40:14.803
MY MISTAKE.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.764
[clicks tongue] YES...

40:18.764 --> 40:20.853
IT IS.

40:20.853 --> 40:22.724
[cocks hammer]

40:22.724 --> 40:24.552
IF YOU SHOOT ME,
YOU'LL BE CAUGHT.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.554
LOOK AROUND, PATRICK.
NO WITNESSES.

40:26.554 --> 40:29.427
NO.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.995
BUT...

40:32.995 --> 40:36.782
THE F.B.I...

40:36.782 --> 40:40.307
HAS BEEN LISTENING
TO EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID.

40:40.307 --> 40:43.441
AND THEY WILL BE ARRIVING...

40:43.441 --> 40:46.269
RIGHT ABOUT...

40:48.228 --> 40:50.491
NOW.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.586
NOW.

41:01.415 --> 41:02.503
NOW.

41:02.503 --> 41:04.592
NICE TRY.

41:13.775 --> 41:15.821
[Cho over loudspeaker]
THIS IS THE F.B.I.

41:15.821 --> 41:18.737
DROP YOUR WEAPON NOW.[feedback whines]

41:18.737 --> 41:21.957
[blades whirring loudly
overhead]

41:34.230 --> 41:37.495
[Patrick shivering]

41:40.323 --> 41:41.890
BYE.

41:44.327 --> 41:46.329
JANE? YOU OKAY?

41:46.329 --> 41:48.418
OH, I'M FINE. BARELY.

41:48.418 --> 41:50.377
YOU GUYS TOOK YOUR TIME
GETTING HERE, DIDN'T YOU?

41:50.377 --> 41:52.161
ANOTHER MINUTE, I WOULD HAVE
BEEN... [stammering]

41:52.161 --> 41:53.815
B-BOBBING AROUND THERE
IN THE MARINA

41:53.815 --> 41:55.425
LIKE A-A DEAD DUCK.

41:55.425 --> 41:56.992
MAYBE YOU'LL LEARN YOUR LESSON.

41:56.992 --> 41:58.733
WH-WHAT LESSON IS THAT?

41:58.733 --> 42:01.214
IF YOU'D ACTUALLY TOLD US ABOUT
YOUR PLAN IN ADVANCE,

42:01.214 --> 42:02.781
WE'D HAVE HAD TIME
TO GET HERE.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.826
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL HIM
THAT FOR YEARS.

42:04.826 --> 42:06.524
OH, CHO, YOU'RE WITH ME,
AREN'T YOU?

42:06.524 --> 42:08.438
NO, I'M WITH THEM.
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE COMMUNICATOR.

42:08.438 --> 42:10.266
YOU'RE JUST LUCKY WE FOUND
THE RIGHT BOAT.

42:10.266 --> 42:12.181
[chuckles][sighs]

42:12.181 --> 42:13.792
OKAY, WELL, YEAH,

42:13.792 --> 42:16.011
MAYBE I NEED TO WORK
ON MY COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

42:16.011 --> 42:17.404
"BUT, YOU KNOW, NO PROBLEM.

42:17.404 --> 42:19.275
THANKS FOR SOLVING THE CRIME,
AND..."

42:19.275 --> 42:21.756
JUST A LITTLE HYPOTHERMIA.
I'LL GET OVER IT.

42:21.756 --> 42:23.366
WHEW!
