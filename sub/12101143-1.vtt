WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:03.000
(dramatic music)

00:16.250 --> 00:18.083
- It's better.

00:20.166 --> 00:22.375
- It lacks excitement.

00:23.667 --> 00:25.625
- You still don't like it?

00:25.625 --> 00:27.458
- This is a big presentation.

00:28.291 --> 00:30.250
- Maybe I've heard it too many times.

00:30.250 --> 00:32.709
I need the board to be 100% in.

00:32.709 --> 00:34.625
If they don't approve
the next round of funding

00:34.625 --> 00:37.542
in next month's meeting,
there won't be an A7.

00:38.542 --> 00:40.500
- We can't keep flying the A6.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.333
- You don't have to convince me

00:43.333 --> 00:45.083
but if you don't convince them,

00:45.083 --> 00:47.291
two of us won't be here
at the end of the year.

00:49.917 --> 00:50.959
We'll still be here.

00:51.834 --> 00:52.667
- Oh.

00:54.667 --> 00:55.500
- Punch it up.

01:04.667 --> 01:05.500
- Punch it up?

01:09.500 --> 01:10.500
- So?

01:12.291 --> 01:13.125
- What?

01:13.125 --> 01:14.500
- Tonight.

01:14.500 --> 01:18.792
- Oh, dinner at seven,
then I'm gonna do it.

01:21.625 --> 01:23.709
- Have you thought about
maybe, I don't know,

01:23.709 --> 01:28.000
just waiting until we
wrap up on this A7 deal?

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
What happens if you get
fired before the wedding?

01:33.500 --> 01:35.458
- You think we won't get the deal?

01:35.458 --> 01:37.500
- No, we will, we will.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.959
Yeah, we'll get it.

01:38.959 --> 01:41.291
I just, I worry too much.

01:42.417 --> 01:43.959
Go have a fantastic night

01:43.959 --> 01:47.458
and text me, if you get the chance.

01:50.709 --> 01:52.166
- You're such a great friend.

01:53.041 --> 01:54.291
- We make a great team.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.542
- [Jason] I'll text you.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.291
- Yeah, he'll text you.

02:06.041 --> 02:09.125
(lighthearted music)

02:10.625 --> 02:12.250
- Melissa.

02:12.250 --> 02:16.125
Over the last two years,
you've changed my life.

02:16.125 --> 02:18.083
You've made me a better man

02:18.083 --> 02:20.083
and showed me what real love is.

02:22.625 --> 02:25.709
We've created so many lasting memories,

02:27.375 --> 02:30.291
from Cancun to Canada.

02:30.291 --> 02:33.792
I can't imagine having
done it with anyone else.

02:33.792 --> 02:36.000
I know, we're still young.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.917
But if there's one thing
I'm sure of, I love you.

02:46.208 --> 02:50.208
(soft rock music in background)

02:51.709 --> 02:53.542
Will you make me the happiest man

02:53.542 --> 02:55.500
in the world and marry me?

03:07.125 --> 03:09.709
(both moaning)

03:11.500 --> 03:12.333
- Don't stop.

03:17.291 --> 03:18.542
Jason.

03:18.542 --> 03:19.375
- Kyle?

03:20.583 --> 03:21.709
Why?

03:21.709 --> 03:22.709
I'm gonna throw up.

03:22.709 --> 03:24.250
- Stop.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.041
It's not about Kyle.

03:26.041 --> 03:27.166
- If you're having sex with him,

03:27.166 --> 03:28.834
it's like I'm having sex with him.

03:30.375 --> 03:31.458
- Not exactly.

03:31.458 --> 03:33.208
- What if you got pregnant?

03:33.208 --> 03:34.458
We'd be on Maury.

03:34.458 --> 03:37.500
"Jason, you are not the father."

03:37.500 --> 03:40.959
- Kyle and I only have anal sex.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.583
- What?

03:42.583 --> 03:43.709
You told me you didn't.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.709
- Just not with you.

03:48.834 --> 03:50.417
The first time you went there,

03:50.417 --> 03:52.458
you were touching it with your thumbs

03:52.458 --> 03:55.166
like it was a PlayStation button.

03:56.333 --> 03:59.458
Either go in or get out.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.959
- A little navigation
would have been nice.

04:14.083 --> 04:14.917
- Oh.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.083
I'm sorry, bro.

04:18.667 --> 04:21.709
I didn't know you and Mel were serious.

04:23.458 --> 04:26.625
- Maybe it's best you go
and let Jason and I talk.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.375
- Oh yeah, no problem.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.250
No hard feelings, bro?

04:31.250 --> 04:32.834
- Yes hard feelings, bro.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.000
- Ah, that's too bad, man.

04:46.917 --> 04:49.542
- What was that, Mel?

04:52.208 --> 04:53.125
- Jason.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.750
We need to talk.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.834
It's not you, it's me.

05:03.333 --> 05:04.917
- So do you just have anal with him

05:04.917 --> 05:06.542
or was that just today?

05:06.542 --> 05:09.500
- If we can't just talk,
then you need to leave.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.333
- Fine.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.166
- Fine.

05:14.125 --> 05:14.959
- Okay, wait.

05:15.917 --> 05:16.750
Let's talk.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.250
- You should have called
before you came over.

05:22.250 --> 05:26.083
- We had dinner plans at now.

05:27.875 --> 05:28.709
- You're right.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.333
I should have told you months ago.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.583
- You've been sleeping
with him for months?

05:34.583 --> 05:35.709
- No.

05:35.709 --> 05:37.792
Kyle has just been a few times.

05:39.458 --> 05:40.291
- Oh.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.417
Okay, I can get past that.

05:46.792 --> 05:49.667
- But there's been a few others.

05:50.917 --> 05:51.750
- A few?

05:52.709 --> 05:53.542
Two?

05:54.750 --> 05:56.750
- No, two is two.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.333
A few is two or more.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.709
Look, it's not about how many.

06:06.709 --> 06:08.667
It's about you and me.

06:11.208 --> 06:13.417
The last two years have been...

06:16.291 --> 06:17.834
What I'm trying to say is-

06:17.834 --> 06:18.667
- Wait.

06:19.792 --> 06:21.000
I have something to say.

06:26.417 --> 06:30.834
Melissa, over the last two years

06:30.834 --> 06:32.500
you have changed my life.

06:34.125 --> 06:35.917
You've made me a better man

06:35.917 --> 06:37.625
and helped focus the direction of my life.

06:37.625 --> 06:38.458
- Jason!

06:42.500 --> 06:44.000
It's over.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.750

07:26.709 --> 07:28.041
- I never liked her.

07:28.959 --> 07:31.667
- You're just saying that
because she doesn't like you.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.166
- She doesn't like me?

07:40.500 --> 07:41.333
- I miss her.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.291
- Don't be a loser.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.041
- I need to get her back.

07:48.041 --> 07:50.333
- You need revenge sex.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.709
Nothing helps a breakup better.

07:52.709 --> 07:54.166
It's clinically proven.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.166
- Will you stop that?

07:55.166 --> 07:57.166
I'm not gonna sleep with someone else.

07:58.208 --> 08:01.542
- Melissa is, probably right now.

welcome to buy your own.

- I like these.

08:51.792 --> 08:52.625
You okay?

08:53.583 --> 08:55.458
- Will you stop drinking all my beer?

08:56.667 --> 08:59.458
- This is not a beer, it's a girl's drink.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.667
(Benji yawning)

09:13.667 --> 09:14.625
You're up early.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.208
This all you got?

09:21.500 --> 09:23.792
- You're free to buy
whatever cereal you want.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.458
- Last night, I met these two girls

09:29.458 --> 09:31.000
on my last delivery.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.750
They invited me in and
we totally got stoned.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.959
I'm going back tonight.

09:36.959 --> 09:37.792
Come with me.

09:39.667 --> 09:40.875
- I'm good.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.542
- But you gotta get out there.

09:47.083 --> 09:47.917
Okay.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.417
(knocking at door)

10:08.458 --> 10:10.166
- Hi, Vee.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.542
- Hey, are you avoiding me?

10:13.750 --> 10:14.583
- No.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.125
I just, I didn't get much sleep.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.291
- Yeah, well, you look like shit.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.000
- Thank you.

10:29.917 --> 10:30.750
- Are you sick?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.291
- It's a long story.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.458
- When you want something,
you really commit.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.375
What are you gonna do now?

10:47.667 --> 10:48.917
- I don't know.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.041
You're a girl.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.291
How do I get her back?

10:54.458 --> 10:55.625
- You want her back?

10:57.458 --> 10:58.709
- Weren't you listening?

11:02.291 --> 11:04.000
- So you go to propose,

11:04.000 --> 11:08.041
and you catch her having
sex with another guy.

11:09.542 --> 11:10.375
- Anal.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.166
In some countries, that's
not considered sex.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.959
- Then you find out that
she's been cheating on you

11:17.959 --> 11:19.750
with a whole bunch of other guys.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.417
- But not a bunch.

11:21.417 --> 11:22.250
A few.

11:23.792 --> 11:25.333
Possibly more than two.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.959
- But she said that it was over.

11:32.875 --> 11:35.083
- Why are you focusing
on all the negatives?

11:38.291 --> 11:39.959
- How did you get this fucked up?

11:43.709 --> 11:45.417
- I thought you were here to help?

11:46.875 --> 11:47.709
- I am.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.667
I am.

11:54.959 --> 11:57.500
You know what, I think you
should go take a shower.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.875
'Cause the look and the
smell is a bit much.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.125
That's a start.

12:07.542 --> 12:10.792
So you're telling me in two years,

12:10.792 --> 12:14.959
she never once said "Don't do this,"

12:14.959 --> 12:16.125
or "I don't like that?"

12:19.208 --> 12:20.834
- She did say that I treat her butt hole

12:20.834 --> 12:23.291
like a PlayStation button.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.125
- What?

12:25.667 --> 12:27.417
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.333
You know, in most relationships,

12:34.333 --> 12:37.750
a couple of months go by, problems arise,

12:37.750 --> 12:39.125
and you just deal with them.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.291
- Never happened.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.959
- How many girlfriends have you had?

12:53.959 --> 12:56.208
Like real relationships,
ones that have lasted longer

12:56.208 --> 12:57.083
than three months.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.625
- Four, or five.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.375
And Melissa, she's the longest.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.333
- Four or five?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.250
That's a doable number.

13:16.208 --> 13:18.709
You know what I think you should do?

13:18.709 --> 13:20.583
I think you should go to them

13:20.583 --> 13:22.333
and asked them how you messed up.

13:24.208 --> 13:25.542
- How I messed it up?

13:25.542 --> 13:29.083
- Yeah, like, get their opinion

13:29.083 --> 13:31.875
on you and the relationship.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.875
Find out what happened.

13:33.875 --> 13:37.917
You know like, were you bad in bed,

13:39.709 --> 13:42.166
or did you have bad breath

13:42.166 --> 13:43.208
or did you snore in your sleep

13:43.208 --> 13:45.417
or dress funny or,

13:45.417 --> 13:46.709
did the parents hate you.

13:47.792 --> 13:50.208
Just ask them questions.

13:50.208 --> 13:54.917
It might give you an answer
as to why Melissa dumped you.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.959
- You want me to ask all my exes

13:58.959 --> 14:00.125
why I'm a bad boyfriend?

14:01.333 --> 14:02.166
- Yes.

14:03.792 --> 14:06.166
- I don't see how this is helping.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.000
- It's helping.

14:08.458 --> 14:09.291
Drink up.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.500
We are on the verge of a breakthrough.

14:18.750 --> 14:19.917
Oh God.

14:23.500 --> 14:28.500
(dog barking)
(garbage truck whirring)

14:28.709 --> 14:31.667
(Jason groaning)

14:31.667 --> 14:34.166
(dog barking)

14:40.041 --> 14:43.834
- Dude, thank you for not coming with me.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.583
What happened to you?

14:48.166 --> 14:49.542
- Major hangover.

14:50.792 --> 14:54.667
- Anyways, last night I went
back to those two girls' house.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.083
At first, we're just sitting and talking.

14:57.083 --> 14:58.458
I was bored as shit.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.125
I was about to leave.

15:00.125 --> 15:03.291
Then, they started kissing
right in front of me.

15:03.291 --> 15:04.500
- Right.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.000
- No bullshit.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.875
Then they look at me and
they go, do you wanna join?

15:10.166 --> 15:11.375
Like that's a question.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.041
My first three way.

15:16.709 --> 15:18.083
- You're serious?

15:18.083 --> 15:21.709
- Four boobs and two vaginas
is a lot of responsibility.

15:21.709 --> 15:24.250
You gotta multitask.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.458
- I'm glad it went well.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.208
I'm going back to sleep.

15:34.625 --> 15:38.333
- Hey, I'm sorry you
had to get drunk alone.

15:40.166 --> 15:42.333
- I didn't, Veronica came over.

15:42.333 --> 15:43.792
- Bang her?

15:43.792 --> 15:44.834
- We're just friends.

15:47.208 --> 15:48.041
- Should've.

15:52.208 --> 15:55.709
(reflective guitar music)

16:04.375 --> 16:07.291
(knocking at door)

16:11.709 --> 16:13.417
- I thought I might see you today.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.208
- What happened last night?

16:18.041 --> 16:19.083
- You don't remember?

16:22.709 --> 16:24.542
- And I thought this was a good idea?

16:25.709 --> 16:27.500
- Check your phone, it's in Notes.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.709
We managed to track down all of your exes,

16:32.709 --> 16:35.291
we found out where they
lived, where they work,

16:35.291 --> 16:37.792
you even went as far as
mapping out an order.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.041
Look, there should be
a link at the bottom.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.709
- [Jason] I don't remember any of this.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.917
- So you don't remember
having sex with me?

16:55.000 --> 16:55.834
- Did we?

16:59.291 --> 17:00.834
- No.

17:00.834 --> 17:01.667
No, we didn't.

17:03.792 --> 17:05.208
- This is gonna take a week.

17:05.208 --> 17:06.125
- Four days.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.208
You already texted Tom
and got the days off.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.041
- What?

17:12.625 --> 17:13.792
I'm going today?

17:15.500 --> 17:16.792
- Why wait?

17:16.792 --> 17:18.208
Just go and talk to them

17:18.208 --> 17:20.583
and then give me a call
and tell me what they said.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.500
You're gonna need a female translator.

17:24.375 --> 17:25.875
- This is crazy.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.709
- No, this is necessary.

17:29.834 --> 17:32.000
Come on, just go home and pack.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.500
This is gonna be good for you.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.667
And no communication with Melissa.

17:38.667 --> 17:41.208
No texts, no calls.

17:41.208 --> 17:43.083
Not until you get back.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.834
Just give her a couple of days too.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.000
- It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.959
Why put yourself through it?

17:52.959 --> 17:54.291
- Veronica's right.

17:54.291 --> 17:57.834
I have no idea why any of my
past relationships failed.

17:57.834 --> 18:00.917
Everything's good and
then overnight, done.

18:00.917 --> 18:03.458
- That's why it's dating.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.917
It's a test drive.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.667
Check under the hood,
take it out on a trip.

18:08.667 --> 18:09.875
- Well if you have all the answers,

18:09.875 --> 18:11.709
then what's my problem?

18:11.709 --> 18:12.750
- One thing.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.959
You date out of your class.

18:14.959 --> 18:15.792
- What?

18:15.792 --> 18:18.000
- The girls you date are too hot for you.

18:19.333 --> 18:20.959
You're average.

18:20.959 --> 18:23.125
They're above average.

18:24.875 --> 18:25.750
- On what scale?

18:25.750 --> 18:27.417
- On every scale.

18:27.417 --> 18:30.667
- You're a quantity dater,
I'm a quality dater.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.041
- My objections have been stated.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.250
- See you in a few days.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.000
- Can I use your apartment
while you're gone?

18:47.458 --> 18:49.041
- What's the matter with yours?

18:49.041 --> 18:50.125
- I have roommates.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.583
I can't get any privacy.

18:53.583 --> 18:55.333
- Oh, I know the feeling.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.375

I'm here to keep you on track, remember?

20:01.542 --> 20:02.917
So how'd you meet?

20:02.917 --> 20:06.166
- After ASU, I interned
in San Diego for a year.

20:06.166 --> 20:07.959
I was at the beach one day

20:07.959 --> 20:10.041
and I saw her walk by after surfing.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.542
That night, I saw her
again at this gaslight bar.

20:15.291 --> 20:16.750
- How long did you date?

20:16.750 --> 20:18.834
- Maybe six months.

20:18.834 --> 20:19.917
- Then how did it end?

20:20.917 --> 20:23.417
- One day she said she
couldn't see me anymore.

20:24.458 --> 20:27.000
- Okay, well good luck

20:28.041 --> 20:29.583
and give me a call after, okay?

20:29.583 --> 20:31.000

21:22.000 --> 21:23.625
Wow, how are you?

21:23.625 --> 21:25.917
- I'm great, still surfing, you know.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.208
- This is so weird.

21:29.208 --> 21:31.542
- Kinda like how we first met.

21:31.542 --> 21:34.041
Well, where you saw me

21:34.041 --> 21:36.667
and then stalked me to that gas lamp bar.

21:36.667 --> 21:37.542
- The Tipsy Crow.

21:40.417 --> 21:42.291
- So are you still living here?

21:42.291 --> 21:44.208
- No, I'm in LA now.

21:44.208 --> 21:45.041
How 'bout you?

21:47.291 --> 21:49.458
- I'm still living here.

21:49.458 --> 21:50.291
- Duh.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.625
You look fantastic.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.333
- Thank you.

21:55.166 --> 21:56.166
Live is good.

21:57.208 --> 21:58.750
So, what brought you down here?

22:00.166 --> 22:01.875
- I just went through a breakup.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.709
I want to propose and she was
sleeping with my old roommate

22:04.709 --> 22:06.333
plus a few others.

22:06.333 --> 22:07.875
But not at the same time.

22:07.875 --> 22:10.583
So I got in the car and drove
out of town to get away.

22:12.792 --> 22:14.417
I'm sorry, probably way more info

22:14.417 --> 22:15.333
than you were looking for.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.250
- A little.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.333
So, you have dinner plans tonight?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.417
(soft music)

22:41.709 --> 22:45.625
If I'm being honest, this
is my only good meal.

22:50.917 --> 22:51.792
- If we're being honest,

22:51.792 --> 22:54.500
us seeing each other again
wasn't exactly an accident.

22:55.959 --> 22:56.792
- I know.

22:58.417 --> 22:59.250
- How?

23:00.500 --> 23:02.333
- I have a video doorbell.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.750
Records anyone that walks up.

23:04.834 --> 23:08.000
- But when I left, I had
no idea I would see you.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.166
That was complete luck.

23:10.125 --> 23:12.333
- Right, like when we first met.

23:13.667 --> 23:15.625
I'm sure you followed me to that bar.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.709
- 100% fluke.

23:19.709 --> 23:20.542
- A fluke.

23:23.375 --> 23:24.667
- A perfect coincidence.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.917
- So why did you really come down?

23:43.291 --> 23:44.125
- Do you mind?

23:56.041 --> 24:00.250
(speaking in foreign language)

24:00.250 --> 24:02.875
- So I don't know if you
remember, but I was married.

24:05.667 --> 24:07.834
I should have said no
but I got so caught up

24:07.834 --> 24:10.458
in the proposal and the family.

24:12.834 --> 24:13.959
She did you a favor.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.709
- When we were dating,
what was it about me

24:22.709 --> 24:23.834
that made you break up?

24:24.917 --> 24:27.375
Be brutal, I can handle it.

24:27.375 --> 24:30.000
- So that's why you showed up.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.959
You're trying to figure
out why she said no.

24:31.959 --> 24:33.333
- What?

24:33.333 --> 24:36.333
- Come on, Jason, be honest.

24:39.417 --> 24:41.792
Our breakup had nothing to do with you.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.709
- It's not me, it's you.

24:45.709 --> 24:48.750
I mean it's not you, it's me.

24:50.625 --> 24:54.166
- Usually, that's an
excuse but it was true.

24:55.291 --> 24:58.333
I met you right when my marriage ended.

24:58.333 --> 25:03.333
You showed up all young and
cute and quirky and young.

25:05.333 --> 25:09.417
I was just flattered
that I was still noticed.

25:09.417 --> 25:11.000
- What?

25:11.000 --> 25:14.917
You were like 27, surfer goddess,

25:14.917 --> 25:17.291
and cooler than Beyonce.

25:19.166 --> 25:20.000
- Thank you.

25:23.417 --> 25:26.083
- But seriously, what happened?

25:27.375 --> 25:29.291
We were doing everything
together for months

25:29.291 --> 25:30.917
and then you just broke it off.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.417
- You want me to be brutal?

25:36.417 --> 25:37.250
- Yes.

25:39.041 --> 25:42.834
- So we had just gotten back from X-Fest

25:42.834 --> 25:44.333
and we started fooling around.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.417
It was a really good night.

25:47.417 --> 25:48.667
We were on fire.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.000
Your mouth was right by my ear,

25:53.000 --> 25:54.333
so I can hear you breathing

25:55.875 --> 25:57.250
and then you whispered-

25:57.250 --> 25:58.333
- I love you.

26:00.417 --> 26:01.417
I thought you didn't

26:02.333 --> 26:05.250
or like did and didn't want to, you know?

26:05.250 --> 26:07.000
- Jason, I'm sorry.

26:07.959 --> 26:10.166
I loved feeling loved by you.

26:11.542 --> 26:13.417
I just knew there wasn't a future.

26:14.583 --> 26:15.667
Just bad timing.

26:30.709 --> 26:32.083
- I should get going.

26:32.083 --> 26:32.917
- Wait.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.583
I have something to show you.

26:39.625 --> 26:43.041
(reflective piano music)

26:52.208 --> 26:53.041
Remember these?

26:55.291 --> 26:56.125
- Wow.

27:00.625 --> 27:02.583
- I didn't come over here to do this-

27:02.583 --> 27:03.792
(Nicole shushing)

27:03.792 --> 27:06.583
- Just tonight and then friends.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.083
Nod if you understand.

27:10.458 --> 27:11.667
Good.

27:11.667 --> 27:15.083
(reflective piano music)

27:28.542 --> 27:29.750
- I feel bad.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.750
All we did was talk about me.

27:31.750 --> 27:32.583
How's your life?

27:35.041 --> 27:36.125
- It's how I like it.

27:37.041 --> 27:37.875
Simple.

27:39.125 --> 27:39.959
- Simple?

27:41.500 --> 27:42.583
Are you dating anyone?

27:43.959 --> 27:45.041
- I like being single.

27:46.333 --> 27:47.625
There's a few guys that I see

27:47.625 --> 27:50.166
but they know it's only temporary.

27:53.125 --> 27:55.041
- Don't you think there's that one guy?

27:56.875 --> 27:58.542
- I married him.

27:58.542 --> 27:59.375
- Oh, right.

28:00.875 --> 28:03.375
- I like the freedom to do
what I want when I want.

28:03.375 --> 28:04.208
You know?

28:11.959 --> 28:14.792
- Was I okay last night?

28:14.792 --> 28:15.625
In bed.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.000
- You were great.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.583
Way better than I remembered.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.125
- You were like my sex Yoda.

28:26.083 --> 28:27.208
- How do you figure?

28:28.041 --> 28:33.041
- Well, before you, I would
just hop on and pound away.

28:33.375 --> 28:35.041
Sort of like a fish out of water

28:36.500 --> 28:38.291
but you taught me to slow down,

28:38.291 --> 28:39.333
to be in the moment,

28:39.333 --> 28:41.750
and make it about you more than just me.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.542
- Sounds like me.

28:43.542 --> 28:44.375
- Thank you.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.125
Really.

28:48.291 --> 28:52.000
I'm still a young Padawan,
but I think I'm adequate.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.875
- More than adequate.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.291
You're like a Jedi.

28:58.792 --> 28:59.792
- Jedi?

Hey.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.834
- You were meant to call last night.

29:26.834 --> 29:28.291
- [Jason] Sorry, it got late.

29:29.166 --> 29:31.417
- So what did you find out?

29:31.417 --> 29:33.083
- I said I love you too early.

29:33.083 --> 29:35.875
It freaked her out and
that's why we split up.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.458
- Yeah, makes sense.

29:37.458 --> 29:38.291
What else?

29:38.291 --> 29:41.000
- She said I'm more than adequate in bed

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
and even better now.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.166
- You had sex with her?

29:45.333 --> 29:47.041
- It just happened.

29:47.041 --> 29:50.667
- Yeah right, what she just
tripped and fell on your dick?

29:50.667 --> 29:54.709
- No, she was showing me
this pink underwear I got her

29:54.709 --> 29:56.875
and she started draping open her robe.

29:56.875 --> 29:58.542
- I don't want to know.

29:58.542 --> 30:00.291
At least it wasn't Melissa.

30:01.709 --> 30:04.875
- I didn't even think
about her until just now.

30:04.875 --> 30:06.959
- That's a step in the right direction.

30:06.959 --> 30:08.333
- I'm not trying to forget about her,

30:08.333 --> 30:09.667
I'm trying to get her back.

30:10.625 --> 30:12.250
Hold on, Benji's calling me.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.709
I'll call you later.

30:13.709 --> 30:14.542
- Okay, but-

30:15.959 --> 30:17.041
- What's up?

30:17.041 --> 30:19.542
- Dude, when are you coming home?

30:19.542 --> 30:20.917
- In a few days, why?

30:20.917 --> 30:22.709
- I invited the three way girls over

30:22.709 --> 30:24.875
and they're impossible to satisfy.

30:26.250 --> 30:29.333
They never get tired.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.125
- What do you want me to do about it?

30:31.125 --> 30:33.333
- I need you to take one
of them off my hands.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.458
One's doing a photo shoot,
one's in the bathroom.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.041
I'm fucking low.

30:37.041 --> 30:38.500
- No way.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.000
- Please, I need to sleep.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.208
Oh shit, she's coming.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.208
I'll call you later.

30:46.041 --> 30:47.208
- Come to bed.

30:48.125 --> 30:49.458

- Hello?

31:46.834 --> 31:48.750
- [Madison] We're closed till two P.M.

31:50.625 --> 31:51.750
- Okay, sorry.

31:54.875 --> 31:57.959
(glasses shattering)

32:08.000 --> 32:09.542
- Hey, Jason.

32:09.542 --> 32:10.375
- Hi.

32:11.709 --> 32:13.291
I'm really sorry about this.

32:14.458 --> 32:15.542
I was just passing by

32:15.542 --> 32:17.792
and I wanted to see if
you still worked here.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.208
- Why?

32:20.208 --> 32:21.834
- I was passing by and I thought,

32:21.834 --> 32:24.041
"I wonder if Madison still works there."

32:24.041 --> 32:26.291
So I put in a little
extra effort and parked.

32:29.041 --> 32:30.583
Now I know.

32:30.583 --> 32:31.417
- Now you know.

32:35.542 --> 32:38.166
- Do you have a few
minutes so we can catch up?

32:38.166 --> 32:40.333
- I have a lot of prep
work before we open.

32:42.667 --> 32:43.917
- Nice seeing you again.

32:49.125 --> 32:51.959
(glass crunching)

33:01.834 --> 33:02.667
- Hey.

33:04.166 --> 33:07.166
We close at 10 if you
wanna come back and talk.

33:07.166 --> 33:08.750
- Awesome.

33:08.750 --> 33:09.583
- Yeah.

33:26.208 --> 33:27.291
- Hello?

33:27.291 --> 33:28.375
- [Jason] Hey!

33:28.375 --> 33:29.709
- Hey, who is this?

33:31.041 --> 33:31.834
- Jason.

33:33.083 --> 33:33.917
- Jason?

33:35.250 --> 33:36.375
College Jason?

33:37.208 --> 33:38.709
- [Jason] Yeah.

33:38.709 --> 33:39.959
- Why are you calling me?

33:42.458 --> 33:45.041
- I was in town and I wanted to say hi.

33:46.041 --> 33:47.875
- Jason, I gotta go.

33:47.875 --> 33:49.375
I'm gonna be late for work.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.375
- Okay, maybe later.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.083
Or not.

34:09.166 --> 34:11.834
(phone chiming)

34:23.834 --> 34:26.083
- Okay, so what's the
deal, do you need money?

34:26.083 --> 34:27.500
- What, no.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.625
- You're not dying, are you?

34:30.625 --> 34:31.458
- I'm fine.

34:32.542 --> 34:33.375
- Then what?

34:44.208 --> 34:47.750
- I wanna know what happened
with our relationship.

34:47.750 --> 34:48.750
Why did we break up?

34:49.750 --> 34:51.458
- You're looking for
closure after four years?

34:51.458 --> 34:52.291
- No.

34:54.583 --> 34:55.834
I just don't understand why any

34:55.834 --> 34:57.458
of my past relationships failed.

34:58.959 --> 35:01.375
- You came all the way
here just to ask me that?

35:02.208 --> 35:03.667
- You won't hurt my feelings.

35:11.875 --> 35:13.041
- My parents hated you.

35:24.709 --> 35:26.166
- Really?

35:26.166 --> 35:27.709
Parents love me.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.875
Usually more than the girl I'm dating.

35:29.875 --> 35:30.792
- I thought they'd like you too

35:30.792 --> 35:31.875
but you fucked it up.

35:35.625 --> 35:36.458
- [Jason] How?

35:37.333 --> 35:38.750
- You really don't remember?

35:44.458 --> 35:45.291
Mini golf.

35:46.875 --> 35:48.291
- You mean when you cheated?

35:49.500 --> 35:50.834
- I didn't cheat, you toad.

35:50.834 --> 35:53.583
You couldn't stand the
fact that I beat you.

35:53.583 --> 35:55.792
- You moved the ball more than six inches,

35:55.792 --> 35:57.291
that's a penalty.

35:57.291 --> 35:58.291
- You didn't have a ruler.

35:58.291 --> 36:00.667
You guesstimated and guesstimated wrong.

36:01.542 --> 36:03.041
- Why are you getting so mad?

36:03.041 --> 36:06.166
- Because it was under six inches.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.000
- So why don't your parents like me?

36:10.166 --> 36:13.333
- The first and only time
I took you meet them,

36:13.333 --> 36:14.208
you brought it up.

36:14.208 --> 36:16.166
In fact, you spent the entire night

36:16.166 --> 36:18.041
talking about me cheating in mini golf.

36:18.041 --> 36:19.291
- They seemed interested.

36:19.291 --> 36:20.250
- Not interested.

36:20.250 --> 36:22.583
You went on and on
about the six inch rule.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.375
- So that's why we broke up?

36:25.375 --> 36:26.208
- Yes.

36:27.583 --> 36:28.417
Mostly.

36:37.875 --> 36:38.709
- Wow.

36:39.875 --> 36:41.709
I am really sorry, Molly.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.166
- I appreciate that.

36:48.166 --> 36:51.208
- I get the competitive
thing from my brother.

36:51.208 --> 36:53.417
He's the six five muscular version of me.

36:54.542 --> 36:56.041
The only way I could ever win at anything

36:56.041 --> 36:57.917
is if he cheated and I could prove it.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.500
- Siblings can be tough.

37:04.834 --> 37:06.959
- But six inches is six inches, cheater.

37:08.291 --> 37:09.125
Sorry.

37:10.208 --> 37:11.208
- That wasn't funny.

37:14.208 --> 37:15.166
- It's sorta funny.

37:18.208 --> 37:19.875
- How good are you at Ms. Pacman?

37:20.709 --> 37:23.792
(video game beeping)

37:30.500 --> 37:33.333
You know, you look good.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.333
- Thank you.

37:35.458 --> 37:36.917
You look amazing.

37:36.917 --> 37:38.458
Like even better than before.

37:38.458 --> 37:40.250
- [Molly] Okay, no more ass kissing.

37:42.959 --> 37:43.792
- Dating anyone?

37:44.667 --> 37:45.792
- Sort of.

37:45.792 --> 37:47.291
It's convenient for now.

37:47.291 --> 37:49.291
I'm so busy at work.

37:51.542 --> 37:52.542
- [Jason] What do you do?

37:52.542 --> 37:55.250
- Property management, 300 units.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.667
- Sounds like 300 problems.

38:00.041 --> 38:00.875
- You got it.

38:02.375 --> 38:04.750
Last year I bought my
first apartment building.

38:05.750 --> 38:06.583
- Nice.

38:06.583 --> 38:09.250
- Six units over in Arcadia,
not far from old town.

38:10.792 --> 38:12.917
- You gonna be the next
real estate tycoon?

38:13.792 --> 38:14.625
- We'll see.

38:19.375 --> 38:20.750
What are you doing tonight?

38:23.125 --> 38:25.792
- I was thinking we could
go play some mini golf.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.291
- You're an idiot.

38:28.750 --> 38:31.875
- No, I'm visiting another one of my exes.

38:31.875 --> 38:33.083
I dated her before you.

38:35.083 --> 38:38.625
- Oh, so you didn't come
here just to see me?

38:40.333 --> 38:42.333
- No, I'm doing a whole road trip thing.

38:43.417 --> 38:44.375
- To see your exes?

38:45.667 --> 38:46.500
- Yup.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.583
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

38:58.625 --> 39:01.291
(phone chiming)

39:16.583 --> 39:20.000
(dramatic country music)

39:28.542 --> 39:29.542
- Are you Jason?

39:31.041 --> 39:32.583
- Yes.

39:32.583 --> 39:33.417
Do I know you?

39:34.917 --> 39:36.250
- What are you doing here?

39:38.458 --> 39:40.000
- I'm meeting a friend.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.750
- I know that, why?

39:46.625 --> 39:49.166
- She's a friend from a few years ago.

39:49.166 --> 39:50.291
- Hey, Einstein.

39:50.291 --> 39:53.208
You've answered everything
expect my fucking question.

39:53.208 --> 39:54.709
- I see you've met Angela.

39:57.083 --> 39:59.417
- Oh, we were just getting
to know each other.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.250
- We live together.

40:05.750 --> 40:08.166
- Oh, we didn't get that
far in the conversation.

40:09.166 --> 40:11.208
- I met Jason in high school.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.250
He was the nicest guy.

40:13.250 --> 40:14.542
- I bet he was.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.417
- I saw her again in college.

40:20.417 --> 40:22.959
- My car battery died and
he offered to jump me.

40:22.959 --> 40:23.917
- I bet he did.

40:23.917 --> 40:25.208
What are we doing here?

40:27.375 --> 40:28.750
- She's so jealous.

40:31.709 --> 40:35.041
- Oh, I didn't realize
you're together together.

40:36.166 --> 40:37.750
I'm no threat.

40:37.750 --> 40:40.083
In fact, I'm getting married.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.875
- Let me see a photo.

40:41.875 --> 40:42.709
- What?

40:43.917 --> 40:44.917
- If you're getting married to this girl

40:44.917 --> 40:46.792
you have to have few pictures of her.

40:47.917 --> 40:48.917
- All right.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
- Are you satisfied?

41:07.625 --> 41:09.333
You're gonna be late for work, go.

41:12.333 --> 41:13.625
- It was nice to meet you.

41:14.500 --> 41:15.333
- Likewise.

41:22.417 --> 41:23.250
- Chug your beer.

41:24.208 --> 41:25.417
- We're done?

41:25.417 --> 41:26.458
- I've been here all day.

41:26.458 --> 41:27.667
Let's go somewhere else.

41:30.875 --> 41:32.917
- [Jason] So how long
you been dating girls?

41:32.917 --> 41:34.583
- Pretty much always.

41:34.583 --> 41:36.709
You're the only guy I went out with.

41:36.709 --> 41:37.542
- No.

41:37.542 --> 41:38.375
- Yeah.

41:39.667 --> 41:41.125
- Why me?

41:41.125 --> 41:43.875
- Well, my mom liked you

41:43.875 --> 41:47.250
and remember when we went to prom?

41:48.250 --> 41:50.542
My mom was so happy to
put up the prom pics

41:50.542 --> 41:51.500
in the living room.

41:55.208 --> 41:57.041
- Does your mom know now?

41:57.041 --> 41:57.917
- She always knew.

41:57.917 --> 41:59.667
She was kinda just waiting on me.

42:02.959 --> 42:05.291
- You only dated me to
make your mom happy?

42:05.291 --> 42:07.500
- Oh, gosh no, that came out wrong.

42:07.500 --> 42:10.333
I always liked being with you.

42:10.333 --> 42:13.709
You always were real.

42:16.083 --> 42:17.041
- To being real.

42:17.041 --> 42:18.000
- To being real.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.834
- Out of all my girlfriends,
you were really my best friend.

42:29.792 --> 42:31.291
There was always something about us

42:31.291 --> 42:33.583
that was just so in sync.

42:33.583 --> 42:35.333
- That's 'cause we both like pussy.

42:37.083 --> 42:38.250
- To pussy.

42:38.250 --> 42:39.375
- I'll drink to that.

42:43.458 --> 42:45.750
And have it for dessert later, too.

42:50.667 --> 42:52.792
- [Veronica] So we know
that you say I love you

42:52.792 --> 42:54.458
way too early.

42:54.458 --> 42:55.542
- Correct.

42:55.542 --> 42:58.083
- [Veronica] And that you
are a stickler for rules.

42:58.083 --> 42:59.625
- Maybe a bit too much.

43:02.125 --> 43:03.625
- And that moms like you

43:03.625 --> 43:06.375
except when your obsessions for rules

43:06.375 --> 43:07.667
shows its ugly face.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.583
- And the girlfriend that I
thought I was closest with

43:10.583 --> 43:12.083
was actually just a friend.

43:15.583 --> 43:17.041
- Are you having a good time?

43:19.125 --> 43:21.125
- It's a little outside my comfort zone.

43:22.083 --> 43:23.417
But I'm glad I'm doing it.

43:24.709 --> 43:25.542
- Good.

43:27.583 --> 43:28.458
- So.

43:29.500 --> 43:30.834
What did you do tonight?

43:35.500 --> 43:37.083
- I went on a date.

43:38.125 --> 43:38.959
- Oh.

43:40.625 --> 43:41.458
Great.

43:42.875 --> 43:44.458
- Yeah.

43:44.458 --> 43:45.709
It was okay.

43:45.709 --> 43:46.750
Do you want details?

43:49.083 --> 43:51.709
- Nah, I'm up early tomorrow
and heading back to LA.

43:54.709 --> 43:56.250
- Kate.

43:56.250 --> 43:57.083
- Kate.

43:58.917 --> 44:00.458
I'm gonna get some sleep.

44:01.375 --> 44:03.041
- Hey, Jason.

44:03.041 --> 44:04.291
- [Jason] Yeah?

44:08.792 --> 44:11.625
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.

44:11.625 --> 44:12.458
Goodnight.

44:13.458 --> 44:14.291
- Night.

44:22.834 --> 44:25.750
(Veronica sighing)

44:33.583 --> 44:36.583
(soft guitar music)

45:05.458 --> 45:08.125
(horns beeping)

45:09.917 --> 45:12.917
(upbeat rock music)

46:07.291 --> 46:09.959
(Jason panting)

46:25.709 --> 46:27.166
- Jason?

46:27.166 --> 46:28.125
- Hey, Kate.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.166
- Hey.

46:30.166 --> 46:31.542
How are you?

46:31.542 --> 46:32.875
Sorry, I'm all sweaty.

46:32.875 --> 46:33.709
- Me, too.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.583
- Not like we haven't been
sweaty together, before.

46:37.583 --> 46:39.166
- I remember.

46:39.166 --> 46:40.709
Sex in Arizona.

46:43.083 --> 46:46.166
- Oh, I meant living in Arizona.

46:46.166 --> 46:48.333
- Oh, I just thought.

46:49.542 --> 46:51.125
- It's good to see you.

46:51.125 --> 46:52.291
Do you live around here?

46:53.542 --> 46:55.458
- No, I'm in Culver City

46:55.458 --> 46:57.333
but I like trying new places to run.

46:57.333 --> 46:58.166
- [Kate] Yeah.

46:58.166 --> 46:59.000
- Gotta stay fit.

47:01.041 --> 47:03.250
- Well, it was great seeing you again.

47:07.041 --> 47:09.125
We should catch up sometime.

47:09.125 --> 47:10.959
- How 'bout right now?

47:15.959 --> 47:17.959
- Yeah, I guess.

47:18.917 --> 47:20.250
- We can do it another day.

47:22.250 --> 47:23.709
You probably have plans.

47:23.709 --> 47:24.959
- No, it's my day off.

47:28.500 --> 47:29.333
- You sure?

47:30.875 --> 47:31.709
- Yeah.

47:39.458 --> 47:41.041
- How?

47:41.041 --> 47:43.417
I haven't been able to
find this anywhere in LA.

47:43.417 --> 47:44.250
- I know.

47:44.250 --> 47:48.333
I found it in some random
little shop in Echo Park.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.834
You got me addicted to this stuff.

47:50.834 --> 47:52.709
- I haven't had one of these in years.

47:58.125 --> 47:58.959
- So good.

48:09.417 --> 48:11.250
- Do you remember our first date?

48:11.250 --> 48:13.417
I bought a six pack of Chihuahua,

48:13.417 --> 48:15.709
sat in your convertible till sunrise.

48:15.709 --> 48:16.875
Talked about all the great things

48:16.875 --> 48:17.709
we were gonna do.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.041
- Yeah.

48:20.041 --> 48:24.417
Yeah, you said that space
travel was gonna make a return

48:24.417 --> 48:25.375
and you were gonna be the guy

48:25.375 --> 48:28.125
who was in the belly of
the beast when it happened.

48:28.125 --> 48:30.041
- How do you remember that?

48:30.041 --> 48:30.959
- It's a gift.

48:33.375 --> 48:36.083
So what did you actually end up doing?

48:36.083 --> 48:37.750
- I'm in the space program.

48:37.750 --> 48:38.917
- Shut the fuck up.

48:40.125 --> 48:41.834
So I've had sex with an astronaut.

48:43.041 --> 48:46.208
- I wish I could check
that off your bucket list.

48:46.208 --> 48:48.583
I'm the flight director
at Rocket Dynamics.

48:48.583 --> 48:51.083
Our rockets put satellites in orbit.

48:51.083 --> 48:52.750
- You know, I don't know anyone

48:52.750 --> 48:54.583
who actually did what they wanted to.

48:55.458 --> 48:56.458
But you always knew.

48:57.959 --> 49:00.500
- You were my only girlfriend
who thought it was cool.

49:00.500 --> 49:01.625
- I did.

49:01.625 --> 49:03.625
I mean it would be way cooler

49:03.625 --> 49:05.417
if you were actually astronaut, but.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.208
I'm really proud of you.

49:12.500 --> 49:14.667
- You were the most driven
person I've ever met.

49:14.667 --> 49:15.834
What are you doing now?

49:22.166 --> 49:24.917
- Are you hungry at all?

49:34.166 --> 49:36.083
- We have a cool new rocket coming up.

49:37.166 --> 49:38.417
- What's it called?

49:38.417 --> 49:40.041
- The A7.

49:40.041 --> 49:42.625
- Nice, and so how fast
do these rockets go?

49:42.625 --> 49:44.875
- Top speed is 27,000 kilometers an hour.

49:46.291 --> 49:47.834
- Unreal.

49:47.834 --> 49:49.500
And what do you do?

49:49.500 --> 49:52.333
- I'm the guy that says go for launch.

49:52.333 --> 49:55.083
But if I say go, I better
not have messed up.

49:56.709 --> 49:58.000
- I'm impressed.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.041
And you know I'm not easily impressed.

50:00.041 --> 50:01.291
- Oh, I remember.

50:02.917 --> 50:06.250
Our fourth date and still no sex.

50:06.250 --> 50:07.375
You made me show you something

50:07.375 --> 50:09.125
that made me worthy of your vagina.

50:10.208 --> 50:12.500
- It wasn't like that.

50:13.792 --> 50:15.875
But my vagina is worth it.

50:15.875 --> 50:18.083
You needed to impress and you did.

50:19.625 --> 50:21.625
- It's one of the few things I'm good at

50:24.375 --> 50:26.625
and definitely not sexy, though.

50:26.625 --> 50:28.542
- Yeah, no, not sexy.

50:31.583 --> 50:32.458
- But it worked.

50:48.250 --> 50:49.083
What?

50:51.208 --> 50:52.875
You still have it?

50:52.875 --> 50:54.458
- It was a gift, why wouldn't I?

51:08.500 --> 51:09.375
You still got it?

51:11.083 --> 51:12.792
- It may not be as impressive now.

51:13.709 --> 51:16.208
- Yeah, I'll be the judge of that one.

51:26.792 --> 51:30.458
(dramatic electronic music)

51:44.291 --> 51:46.333
- Not bad for out of practice.

51:49.291 --> 51:53.250
- Come here.

51:53.250 --> 51:54.500
- [Jason] What?

51:55.333 --> 51:56.333
- Come here.

52:04.667 --> 52:07.041
So I hope you don't mind but

52:07.041 --> 52:09.834
I'm going to say I've had
sex with an astronaut.

52:09.834 --> 52:10.667
- Fine with me.

52:19.208 --> 52:21.542
- I probably should have asked.

52:22.458 --> 52:23.625
Are you seeing anybody?

52:25.417 --> 52:26.250
- I was.

52:28.333 --> 52:30.333
In fact, I almost asked her to marry me.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
- And what happened?

52:35.041 --> 52:37.125
- She was having sex with my old roommate.

52:41.542 --> 52:42.375
- I'm sorry.

52:45.083 --> 52:47.542
- Enough about me, what about you?

52:50.542 --> 52:52.166
- Do you remember what my plan was?

52:52.166 --> 52:53.000
- Totally.

52:54.291 --> 52:55.875
- I bet we remember differently.

52:58.583 --> 53:01.875
- Our junior year at
ASU, before Christmas,

53:01.875 --> 53:04.041
you told me you wanted to be the head

53:04.041 --> 53:07.583
of Media Relations at
a Fortune 100 company.

53:07.583 --> 53:10.041
Not 500 but 100.

53:11.250 --> 53:12.291
- That's pretty good.

53:13.500 --> 53:14.500
Do you remember why?

53:16.000 --> 53:18.583
- You loved when a company
like that got in trouble.

53:19.542 --> 53:22.041
The media relations person would come out

53:22.041 --> 53:25.583
and put a public spin on it so crafted,

53:25.583 --> 53:28.000
it made the whole public
regain confidence again

53:28.000 --> 53:30.750
and the stock holders relaxed.

53:30.750 --> 53:33.166
(soft music)

53:49.000 --> 53:49.834
I'm sorry.

53:51.083 --> 53:52.083
Did I say something?

54:04.208 --> 54:06.792
(door closing)

54:17.417 --> 54:20.041
- I just freaked you out, didn't I?

54:20.041 --> 54:20.875
- No.

54:22.875 --> 54:23.709
- Jason.

54:24.959 --> 54:25.792
- A bit.

54:27.500 --> 54:28.792
Okay, you freaked me out.

54:31.417 --> 54:32.250
What did I say?

54:34.166 --> 54:35.417
- Okay, I'm gonna tell you something

54:35.417 --> 54:38.375
that I've never told anyone, okay?

54:38.375 --> 54:39.208
- Okay.

54:44.250 --> 54:47.291
- My freshman year I was
broke and had to make tuition.

54:48.208 --> 54:49.500
- You were on a full ride.

54:50.959 --> 54:53.083
- No, not the first year.

54:53.083 --> 54:53.959
I had to earn it.

54:55.208 --> 54:57.083
So, by Christmas I was broke.

54:58.041 --> 55:01.000
Tuition, housing was
due, I had to buy books

55:02.875 --> 55:06.083
and I found out that a
bunch of girls in the dorm

55:06.083 --> 55:07.208
had sugar daddies.

55:09.834 --> 55:13.709
But instead, I started doing cam modeling.

55:13.709 --> 55:15.500
No modeling required.

55:17.291 --> 55:20.834
I would get men off in private chats.

55:23.709 --> 55:25.458
You don't wanna hear this, do you?

55:25.458 --> 55:26.792
- You can tell me anything.

55:27.625 --> 55:29.792
- Well, after the first few days

55:29.792 --> 55:32.792
I figured out a way to
make a lot of money.

55:32.792 --> 55:35.625
The longer I could keep
guys on a private session,

55:35.625 --> 55:36.458
the more I made.

55:36.458 --> 55:39.542
So I got really good
at controlling the pace

55:40.458 --> 55:43.542
and after two months, I
paid off all my bills.

55:43.542 --> 55:45.458
I quit, I finished top of my class

55:45.458 --> 55:46.750
and I was on my way.

55:54.291 --> 55:58.875
And of all people, I didn't
prepare for damage control.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.375
My first big interview
after college was amazing.

56:04.583 --> 56:06.208
You know, I got offered a great salary,

56:06.208 --> 56:10.375
stock options, benefits.

56:10.375 --> 56:11.709
Pending a background check.

56:16.125 --> 56:17.667
- But how did they find out?

56:17.667 --> 56:19.291
You didn't use your real name, did you?

56:19.291 --> 56:20.125
- No.

56:21.208 --> 56:24.458
Where I fucked up is I used
a photo from my cam profile

56:24.458 --> 56:25.917
from a Cancun vacation.

56:26.834 --> 56:28.959
That same photo is on my
Instagram and Facebook.

56:29.875 --> 56:31.166
- Reverse image search.

56:35.375 --> 56:38.542
- Every interview after that
was pretty much the same.

56:38.542 --> 56:39.959
I was the most qualified
person in the room

56:39.959 --> 56:41.291
until the background check.

56:42.417 --> 56:44.750
Sometimes I'd get a, you know,

56:44.750 --> 56:47.208
thank you but no thank you email.

56:47.208 --> 56:49.583
But usually I was just ghosted.

56:49.583 --> 56:50.417
- I'm sorry.

56:51.834 --> 56:54.166
But your so talented.

56:54.166 --> 56:58.583
Fuck Fortune 100, 200, how 'bout 500?

56:59.542 --> 57:00.875
- Keep going.

57:00.875 --> 57:03.208
I finally got hired at
a Fortune 1,000 company.

57:04.583 --> 57:06.166
Took 'em two months to find out.

57:07.250 --> 57:09.000
Got fired and walked to my car.

57:10.458 --> 57:12.583
The boss said he was sorry

57:12.583 --> 57:15.417
and then he hit on me, right
there in the parking lot.

57:21.375 --> 57:23.041
I need a drink.

57:23.041 --> 57:26.375
(soft reflective music)

57:36.417 --> 57:40.583
Well, all I have left
are Rita's Mangoritas.

58:02.208 --> 58:03.458
What?

58:03.458 --> 58:06.959
- I wish you could see
you the way I see you.

58:11.792 --> 58:12.625
- Jason.

58:14.792 --> 58:17.875
I may have made a mistake
not keeping you in my life.

58:18.709 --> 58:20.166
- It never would have worked.

58:21.792 --> 58:22.625
- Really?

58:24.166 --> 58:26.041
- Us astronauts get the ladies.

58:27.375 --> 58:28.458
What can I say?

58:31.291 --> 58:33.000
- Well, I'm really glad you're here.

58:34.875 --> 58:35.709
- Me too.

58:44.083 --> 58:47.000
(soft rock music)

58:47.000 --> 58:47.834
- Hey?

58:48.917 --> 58:49.750
Are you home?

58:50.625 --> 58:52.417
I went past your place last night.

58:52.417 --> 58:54.667
- Oh, I'm just leaving Kate's now.

58:58.333 --> 58:59.417
Hello?

58:59.417 --> 59:02.000
- Well, what did you learn
from sleeping with Kate?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.041
- Who says we slept together?

59:04.041 --> 59:07.250
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that...

59:07.250 --> 59:08.709
- We did, several times.

59:09.583 --> 59:14.208
- Well, you might just go
for a trifecta this week.

59:14.208 --> 59:16.208
- Well, this was all your idea.

59:16.208 --> 59:18.792
Why are you getting so upset at me?

59:18.792 --> 59:19.625
I'm going home.

59:19.625 --> 59:21.166
- No, no, you've come this far,

59:21.166 --> 59:26.166
just go see Izzy and try
to keep it in your pants.

59:26.542 --> 59:27.917
- Nothing's gonna happen with her,

59:27.917 --> 59:29.625
she's the shy one.

59:29.625 --> 59:31.750
We dated for like a month
before doing anything

59:31.750 --> 59:33.625
and never with the lights on.

59:33.625 --> 59:35.250
- Why?

59:35.250 --> 59:38.583
- She was a little heavy and
it's always bothered her.

59:38.583 --> 59:39.959
She's really sweet, though.

59:41.375 --> 59:42.583
- So why'd you break up?

59:44.291 --> 59:45.250
- I don't know.

59:47.208 --> 59:48.458
- You know what.

59:48.458 --> 59:51.542
Go see Izzy, found out, and then call me.

59:51.542 --> 59:54.166
Okay, I want a full debriefing tonight.

59:54.166 --> 59:55.959
- Okay, but you can't get mad at me.

59:58.125 --> 59:58.959
- Call me.

1:00:00.834 --> 1:00:03.834
(upbeat rock music)

1:00:19.458 --> 1:00:20.834
(door bell ringing)

1:00:20.834 --> 1:00:22.500
- [Izzy] Just a sec!

1:00:25.125 --> 1:00:27.375
- Hi, does Izzy still live here?

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:31.834
- Jason?

1:00:34.291 --> 1:00:35.125
- Izzy?

1:00:36.166 --> 1:00:37.542
- What are you doing here?

1:00:39.875 --> 1:00:40.834
- Funny story.

1:00:45.542 --> 1:00:48.375
- So, why do you think that we broke up?

1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:54.208
- I can't remember.

1:00:54.208 --> 1:00:55.125
You were always so nice

1:00:55.125 --> 1:00:57.375
I don't even remember
arguing about anything.

1:00:58.709 --> 1:01:02.333
- I used to please men by being agreeable.

1:01:02.333 --> 1:01:06.166
We can eat wherever, that movie's fine.

1:01:06.166 --> 1:01:08.041
Another blow job, sure.

1:01:08.041 --> 1:01:10.667
It's not like I'm busy
studying or anything.

1:01:15.041 --> 1:01:17.500
- But with me specifically,
do you remember?

1:01:19.291 --> 1:01:22.834
- I remember everything
about every guy I've dated.

1:01:23.792 --> 1:01:24.625
Pigs.

1:01:26.500 --> 1:01:27.583
- Did I treat you bad?

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:31.834
- Nothing major.

1:01:33.166 --> 1:01:36.250
When you shaved, you would
leave all those little hairs

1:01:36.250 --> 1:01:38.917
in the sink and after you ate,

1:01:38.917 --> 1:01:41.875
you would take your plate
and put it on the counter

1:01:41.875 --> 1:01:45.166
on top of the dishwasher.

1:01:45.166 --> 1:01:47.250
And I know that this is picky

1:01:47.250 --> 1:01:49.250
but you would leave your dirty socks

1:01:49.250 --> 1:01:50.250
next to the hamper.

1:01:50.250 --> 1:01:53.375
Not even next to it, touching the hamper.

1:01:55.208 --> 1:01:56.875
- Why didn't you say something?

1:01:56.875 --> 1:01:59.041
- Because I'm a sucker.

1:01:59.041 --> 1:02:00.542
Every time we had sex,

1:02:00.542 --> 1:02:03.291
it started off with me
giving you a blow job.

1:02:03.291 --> 1:02:05.500
How 'bout returning the favor?

1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:06.333
- I did.

1:02:08.417 --> 1:02:09.500
Twice?

1:02:10.333 --> 1:02:11.250
- Twice.

1:02:11.250 --> 1:02:14.458
And I used to send you these cute texts

1:02:14.458 --> 1:02:17.083
with specific things
that I loved about you

1:02:17.083 --> 1:02:19.792
just to make your day a little bit better.

1:02:21.208 --> 1:02:22.375
- They did.

1:02:22.375 --> 1:02:23.875
- Then send something back better

1:02:23.875 --> 1:02:25.917
than a fucking thumbs up emoji.

1:02:28.792 --> 1:02:29.709
- I'm sorry, Izzy.

1:02:30.959 --> 1:02:31.834
I didn't know.

1:02:35.458 --> 1:02:38.250
- It's okay, men are stupid.

1:02:41.542 --> 1:02:46.542
- So, what do you do for work?

1:02:50.792 --> 1:02:51.959
- How 'bout I show you?

1:02:57.166 --> 1:03:00.166
(upbeat drum music)

1:03:09.250 --> 1:03:10.375
You wanna try it?

1:03:11.417 --> 1:03:12.375
No charge.

1:03:14.542 --> 1:03:16.375
- It's not my thing.

1:03:16.375 --> 1:03:18.792
- How would you do if
you've never tried it?

1:03:21.166 --> 1:03:23.583
- I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like it.

1:03:23.583 --> 1:03:25.875
- You're a fucking pussy.

1:03:25.875 --> 1:03:27.041
- What?

1:03:27.041 --> 1:03:28.959
- I can loan you some of my panties

1:03:28.959 --> 1:03:31.583
in case you're feeling
a little vulnerable.

1:03:31.583 --> 1:03:33.208
- No, I just-

1:03:33.208 --> 1:03:34.542
- I said try it!

1:03:34.542 --> 1:03:35.375
- Okay.

1:03:40.333 --> 1:03:45.083
- We're going to need to
come up with a safe word.

1:03:45.083 --> 1:03:46.291
How about

1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:53.166
Izzy is my master.

1:03:54.834 --> 1:03:56.500
- Izzy is my master.

1:04:00.709 --> 1:04:05.709
- And after we're done shaving,
we're gonna clean it up.

1:04:06.041 --> 1:04:06.959
Aren't we?

1:04:09.125 --> 1:04:11.250
(muffled grunts)

1:04:11.250 --> 1:04:12.083
Good.

1:04:14.125 --> 1:04:15.291
Dirty dishes

1:04:17.709 --> 1:04:21.083
go into the dishwasher, don't they?

1:04:21.083 --> 1:04:21.917
- Yeah.

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:29.375
- Dirty socks.

1:04:31.750 --> 1:04:35.041
We drop them into the hamper.

1:04:35.041 --> 1:04:36.291
Don't we?

1:04:36.291 --> 1:04:37.250
- Yeah.

1:04:37.250 --> 1:04:39.750
Izzy, Izzy is my master.

1:04:39.750 --> 1:04:41.250
Izzy is my master.

1:04:45.542 --> 1:04:47.709
- And when we have sex with our partner,

1:04:47.709 --> 1:04:50.959
we're gonna satisfy them first,

1:04:50.959 --> 1:04:53.250
every time.

1:04:53.250 --> 1:04:54.709
Aren't we, lover?

1:04:54.709 --> 1:04:56.041
- Yes, yes, yes.

1:04:57.041 --> 1:04:58.709
- Don't worry, baby.

1:04:58.709 --> 1:05:00.000
No more spanking.

1:05:02.792 --> 1:05:04.250
You've earned something else.

1:05:12.792 --> 1:05:16.917
Have you ever wondered what it's like

1:05:16.917 --> 1:05:21.917
to get fucked and receive
absolutely zero pleasure?

1:05:23.333 --> 1:05:28.333
- Izzy is my master, Izzy is my master.

1:05:29.625 --> 1:05:31.500
- This is gonna hurt a little.

1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:34.417
(muffled shouting)

1:05:41.083 --> 1:05:43.834
(Jason groaning)

1:05:48.959 --> 1:05:51.792
(phone vibrating)

1:05:53.375 --> 1:05:54.375
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:05:55.375 --> 1:05:56.208
- How'd it go?

1:05:57.750 --> 1:05:58.583
- It was painful.

1:06:02.834 --> 1:06:04.625
- Did you hit the trifecta?

1:06:05.917 --> 1:06:07.375
- I wanna tell you in person.

1:06:07.375 --> 1:06:09.542
Could I meet you somewhere?

1:06:09.542 --> 1:06:11.041
- Yeah, I'm about to head out.

1:06:12.083 --> 1:06:14.750
- Well, meet me at Lansing Park.

1:06:15.709 --> 1:06:19.542
- Okay, Lansing Park, 30 minutes.

1:06:20.625 --> 1:06:21.667
- Hey, Vee.

1:06:21.667 --> 1:06:22.542
- [Veronica] Yeah?

1:06:23.792 --> 1:06:24.625
- I missed you.

1:06:26.041 --> 1:06:28.208
I hope that's not weird.

1:06:28.208 --> 1:06:29.041
- No.

1:06:30.625 --> 1:06:31.458
Me, too.

1:06:33.333 --> 1:06:34.166
- All right.

1:06:36.250 --> 1:06:37.083
- Bye.

1:06:52.125 --> 1:06:55.041
(knocking at door)

1:07:06.417 --> 1:07:08.208
- What are you doing here?

1:07:08.208 --> 1:07:09.083
- We need to talk.

1:07:11.250 --> 1:07:12.709
- How'd you now I was here?

1:07:12.709 --> 1:07:13.583
(Benji groaning)

1:07:13.583 --> 1:07:15.041
- Where is he?

1:07:15.959 --> 1:07:17.333
- I can't tell you.

1:07:17.333 --> 1:07:18.333
(bones creaking)

1:07:18.333 --> 1:07:19.750
Lansing Park, Lansing Park.

1:07:21.125 --> 1:07:21.959
- Sit.

1:07:27.709 --> 1:07:30.959
First, I want to say
sorry about what happened

1:07:30.959 --> 1:07:33.375
and I want us to forget all that, okay?

1:07:35.333 --> 1:07:36.166
- Okay.

1:07:37.709 --> 1:07:38.542
Why?

1:07:39.709 --> 1:07:42.542
- Well, over the last few days,

1:07:42.542 --> 1:07:45.375
I asked myself, what do I want?

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:48.583
- Me?

1:07:48.583 --> 1:07:50.250
- Not exactly.

1:07:50.250 --> 1:07:52.667
But I realize I might have to compromise.

1:07:53.750 --> 1:07:58.166
You'll never be a Jason
Bateman or Jason Statham.

1:07:58.166 --> 1:08:03.166
But you could be a Jason
Biggs or Jason Schwartzman.

1:08:03.375 --> 1:08:04.834
I'm sure they're nice people.

1:08:06.667 --> 1:08:09.000
- Where are you going with this?

1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:10.458
- Hello?

1:08:10.458 --> 1:08:13.250
You're not very smart for
a rocket guy, are you?

1:08:14.375 --> 1:08:16.750
Let's pick up where you
came over to propose

1:08:16.750 --> 1:08:18.166
but instead of what happened.

1:08:19.041 --> 1:08:20.625
- Kyle having butt sex with you.

1:08:21.792 --> 1:08:23.667
- That is not being productive.

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:29.583
Imagine you came in and
I was looking fabulous,

1:08:29.583 --> 1:08:31.083
what would you have said to me?

1:08:35.625 --> 1:08:37.041
- Hi, Melissa, you look great.

1:08:37.041 --> 1:08:37.875
Are you hungry?

1:08:37.875 --> 1:08:38.709
- No.

1:08:40.041 --> 1:08:41.083
Do you have the ring?

1:08:42.083 --> 1:08:43.250
- Yeah.

1:08:43.250 --> 1:08:46.041
- Do the get down on one knee part,

1:08:46.041 --> 1:08:46.875
with the ring.

1:08:51.542 --> 1:08:54.625
- You know, a lot has happened
over the last few days.

1:08:54.625 --> 1:08:56.125
I've been thinking a lot, too.

1:08:57.500 --> 1:09:00.500
I think we might need to
spend some time apart.

1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:01.583
- Jason, please.

1:09:03.083 --> 1:09:04.792
Do you know how hard it
was for me to come here

1:09:04.792 --> 1:09:06.583
and admit that I was wrong?

1:09:13.458 --> 1:09:16.375
(soft tense music)

1:09:17.375 --> 1:09:19.166
- Melissa, over the last two years,

1:09:19.166 --> 1:09:20.875
you've changed my life.

1:09:20.875 --> 1:09:22.375
You've made me a better man

1:09:22.375 --> 1:09:23.208
and helped focus-

1:09:23.208 --> 1:09:25.291
- Yes, yes, I've heard this part.

1:09:25.291 --> 1:09:26.125
Skip to the end.

1:09:29.875 --> 1:09:32.208
- Melissa, will you
make me the happiest man

1:09:32.208 --> 1:09:33.500
in the world and marry me?

1:09:38.291 --> 1:09:39.125
- Huh.

1:09:44.458 --> 1:09:45.291
Sure.

1:09:51.667 --> 1:09:53.417
- Jason, what are you doing?

1:09:55.959 --> 1:09:57.125
- [Melissa] Who are you?

1:09:58.583 --> 1:10:00.542
- Well, she's just a girl from my work.

1:10:04.709 --> 1:10:06.166
- You two deserve each other.

1:10:11.041 --> 1:10:12.333
- Did she just insult me?

1:10:14.333 --> 1:10:15.208
Jason.

1:10:16.125 --> 1:10:16.959
Look at me.

1:10:21.291 --> 1:10:22.208
Who was that?

1:10:23.792 --> 1:10:24.750
- I'm gonna go.

1:10:26.792 --> 1:10:28.625
- I want some answers.

1:10:34.667 --> 1:10:38.458
- Melissa, it's not you, it's me.

1:10:41.750 --> 1:10:42.583
Goodbye.

1:10:44.333 --> 1:10:45.500
- You'll be back.

1:10:51.417 --> 1:10:52.250
Asshole.

1:10:56.500 --> 1:10:58.208
- So you messed up.

1:10:58.208 --> 1:11:00.250
Call her, say you're sorry.

1:11:01.959 --> 1:11:02.792
- I did.

1:11:05.083 --> 1:11:05.917
- Text?

1:11:06.959 --> 1:11:08.208
- I stopped after seven.

1:11:09.583 --> 1:11:10.417
- Nothing?

1:11:13.875 --> 1:11:16.542
Go to her house, buy her flowers,

1:11:16.542 --> 1:11:18.875
and beg for forgiveness.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.792
- No, I'll see her at work tomorrow.

1:11:31.583 --> 1:11:33.750
Whatever happened to
those three way girls?

1:11:36.625 --> 1:11:38.125
- I couldn't get rid of them.

1:11:39.375 --> 1:11:41.667
I had to fake a penis injury.

1:11:43.375 --> 1:11:45.917
Then they lost all interest and left.

1:11:47.166 --> 1:11:49.458
I discovered I'm a one girl guy.

1:11:50.750 --> 1:11:51.709
- Crazy week.

1:11:52.875 --> 1:11:54.291
- Tomorrow is a new day.

1:11:55.542 --> 1:11:57.709
Things always work out
the way they should.

1:12:05.291 --> 1:12:07.458
- Diane is gonna help get
the presentation finished

1:12:07.458 --> 1:12:09.500
until Veronica gets back.

1:12:09.500 --> 1:12:11.583
- What, where's Veronica?

1:12:12.625 --> 1:12:14.125
- You haven't talked with her?

1:12:14.125 --> 1:12:15.834
I assumed you knew before I did.

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:17.834
- Knew what?

1:12:18.917 --> 1:12:22.000
- So, where are we with the changes?

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.041
- I wanna score the presentation.

1:12:24.959 --> 1:12:29.375
Stock music sounds sort of stock.

1:12:29.375 --> 1:12:31.667
- Wait, when is she coming back?

1:12:32.709 --> 1:12:34.166
- I didn't talk to her.

1:12:34.166 --> 1:12:35.959
Are you good changing the music?

1:12:35.959 --> 1:12:38.166
- Wait, where is she?

1:12:38.166 --> 1:12:41.500
- Jason, I had her job before she did.

1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:42.500
I got this.

1:12:46.542 --> 1:12:47.875
- Where are you going?

1:12:47.875 --> 1:12:49.709
- I'm going to get Veronica back.

1:12:49.709 --> 1:12:51.667
Without her there is no presentation.

1:12:53.250 --> 1:12:54.208
No offense, Diana.

1:12:56.166 --> 1:12:57.458
- Can't you just call her?

1:13:00.959 --> 1:13:04.125
- That was a relationship reaction.

1:13:04.125 --> 1:13:07.458
(muffled hip hop music)

1:13:12.458 --> 1:13:15.375
(doorbell ringing)

1:13:24.417 --> 1:13:25.250
- Veronica.

1:13:26.208 --> 1:13:27.041
Can I explain?

1:13:30.625 --> 1:13:31.542
I'm sorry.

1:13:33.291 --> 1:13:35.959
I know it looked like I was proposing

1:13:35.959 --> 1:13:37.875
but I wasn't gonna go through with it.

1:13:39.875 --> 1:13:42.291
The truth is, the whole time I was gone,

1:13:44.125 --> 1:13:46.083
the only one I was thinking of was you.

1:13:50.917 --> 1:13:54.417
I don't know how I didn't
realize this sooner

1:13:54.417 --> 1:13:55.709
but I love you, Vee.

1:13:58.250 --> 1:14:00.291
I always have.

1:14:00.291 --> 1:14:02.000
Since the first day I saw you.

1:14:03.667 --> 1:14:05.875
I was just scared if we
got into a relationship

1:14:05.875 --> 1:14:07.041
and it didn't work out.

1:14:08.291 --> 1:14:09.709
No one stays friends.

1:14:12.667 --> 1:14:14.417
Will you give me a chance, please?

1:14:23.333 --> 1:14:24.417
- I think you blew it.

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:26.834
- Who are you?

1:14:27.667 --> 1:14:30.166
- I'm Carrie, Vee's sister.

1:14:32.166 --> 1:14:34.792
Vee's been talking about
you for the last two years.

1:14:36.041 --> 1:14:37.125
- To you?

1:14:37.125 --> 1:14:39.542
- My whole freaking
family knows about Jason

1:14:39.542 --> 1:14:40.834
from the party.

1:14:42.041 --> 1:14:42.834
- What party?

1:14:43.792 --> 1:14:47.250
- The 2018 Christmas party.

1:14:47.250 --> 1:14:49.542
Heard it a thousand times.

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.250
- What she say?

1:14:56.834 --> 1:14:58.542
- That you and Vee snuck into the lounge

1:14:58.542 --> 1:15:00.000
with a bottle of Jack,

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.667
talked so long that
everyone at the party left.

1:15:02.667 --> 1:15:03.542
- About right.

1:15:03.542 --> 1:15:06.291
- Talked about family and kids

1:15:08.083 --> 1:15:09.875
and when the time was right,

1:15:09.875 --> 1:15:12.792
you looked into her eyes and
you leaned in for a kiss.

1:15:13.917 --> 1:15:15.500
- You don't have to say it.

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:18.417
- And you threw up all over her and you.

1:15:21.417 --> 1:15:22.834
- I'm bad with hard alcohol.

1:15:23.750 --> 1:15:25.709
- Obviously.

1:15:25.709 --> 1:15:26.709
And what did she do?

1:15:27.709 --> 1:15:29.333
She took you home, got you cleaned up,

1:15:29.333 --> 1:15:30.834
and put you to bed.

1:15:35.333 --> 1:15:37.166
You blew it.

1:15:37.166 --> 1:15:38.750
At least you would have with me.

1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:42.542
But she still loves you.

1:15:42.542 --> 1:15:43.500
I don't know why.

1:15:45.458 --> 1:15:47.333
- She said that?

1:15:47.333 --> 1:15:50.542
She said that out loud in a sentence?

1:15:52.250 --> 1:15:54.542
- I have to be honest,
I'm not that impressed.

1:15:55.792 --> 1:15:56.667
- Where is she?

1:15:57.667 --> 1:16:00.166
- She went on a trip with this guy, Mitch.

1:16:00.166 --> 1:16:02.875
He's been asking her out for months.

1:16:05.709 --> 1:16:06.542
- Where?

1:16:07.667 --> 1:16:09.083
- I promised not to tell you.

1:16:11.291 --> 1:16:13.917
- I need to talk with her.

1:16:13.917 --> 1:16:15.417
- Sorry, we're family.

1:16:43.917 --> 1:16:44.750
- Dude!

1:16:46.041 --> 1:16:47.208
- We need to talk.

1:16:50.375 --> 1:16:52.333
I'm sorry how shit went down.

1:16:56.542 --> 1:16:59.250
I'm your boy and I've had your back.

1:17:00.667 --> 1:17:02.583
But you smell.

1:17:02.583 --> 1:17:04.291
You're missing all your interviews

1:17:05.875 --> 1:17:08.166
and I hear what goes on here every night.

1:17:10.041 --> 1:17:10.875
- What?

1:17:12.291 --> 1:17:13.500
- You want me to say it?

1:17:16.583 --> 1:17:19.834
You're whacking off loudly or crying.

1:17:20.834 --> 1:17:21.750
Usually both.

1:17:28.083 --> 1:17:29.875
It's time to take a shower.

1:17:29.875 --> 1:17:32.208
Call the people that for some reason

1:17:32.208 --> 1:17:33.917
keep trying to interview you

1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:38.792
and get on with life.

1:17:42.542 --> 1:17:43.709
- You're a good friend.

1:17:46.959 --> 1:17:48.959
- Yes, I am.

1:17:48.959 --> 1:17:51.417
(knocking at door)

1:17:51.417 --> 1:17:53.291
This is for your own good.

1:17:55.417 --> 1:17:56.250
- Who is it?

1:17:59.166 --> 1:18:00.000
Diana?

1:18:01.041 --> 1:18:03.250
- You look horrible.

1:18:03.250 --> 1:18:05.250
- [Jason] You came over to tell me that?

1:18:06.458 --> 1:18:08.333
- I'm VP at Pacific Aerospace now.

1:18:09.250 --> 1:18:10.625
- I heard.

1:18:10.625 --> 1:18:11.709
- Really?

1:18:11.709 --> 1:18:14.667
Because my HR guy has been
trying to get you in for months.

1:18:18.333 --> 1:18:20.250
- I was gonna call him back.

1:18:20.250 --> 1:18:21.875
I'm taking a few months off

1:18:21.875 --> 1:18:23.917
to figure out what I wanna do.

1:18:25.083 --> 1:18:27.333
- You know, Tom still blames you

1:18:27.333 --> 1:18:30.000
for not getting the board's
approval on the A7 money.

1:18:30.959 --> 1:18:33.125
- I hope that's not why you got fired.

1:18:33.125 --> 1:18:37.000
- No, I just realized that
if you didn't have a penis,

1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:38.875
I wasn't getting promoted any higher.

1:18:39.917 --> 1:18:41.291
- A lot of dick at the top.

1:18:42.959 --> 1:18:44.834
- So what do I have to do

1:18:44.834 --> 1:18:46.709
to get you to come work with me?

1:18:46.709 --> 1:18:49.458
We have better pay, better benefits.

1:18:50.917 --> 1:18:52.959
- How do you see me fitting in?

1:18:54.083 --> 1:18:58.250
- Before, we were always
chasing number one

1:18:58.250 --> 1:19:01.291
but at Pacific, we are number one

1:19:01.291 --> 1:19:02.875
and I need you to keep us there.

1:19:05.583 --> 1:19:09.041
- I always thought I wanted
to be in the space program

1:19:09.041 --> 1:19:09.875
and I did it.

1:19:11.250 --> 1:19:13.917
But I think I want to
do something else now.

1:19:13.917 --> 1:19:16.834
- I'll double what you were making.

1:19:16.834 --> 1:19:17.667
- Yes.

1:19:19.542 --> 1:19:20.959
- It's not about the money.

1:19:22.250 --> 1:19:23.750
I need to find something else.

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:26.625
- At least think about it.

1:19:26.625 --> 1:19:30.208
You know more about the space
program than anyone I know.

1:19:30.208 --> 1:19:32.291
The world needs your talents.

1:19:32.291 --> 1:19:33.500
Don't just walk away.

1:19:41.083 --> 1:19:42.208
- I'll think about it.

1:19:43.542 --> 1:19:44.500
- Is that a maybe?

1:19:47.792 --> 1:19:48.625
Is that a maybe?

1:19:50.166 --> 1:19:51.667
- It's a yes.

1:19:51.667 --> 1:19:53.250
- It's a no.

1:19:53.250 --> 1:19:55.083
I spent the last week
thinking through my options

1:19:55.083 --> 1:19:56.458
and I need to make a change.

1:19:57.250 --> 1:20:00.208
Come on Jason, give us a try
just tell me what you want

1:20:00.792 --> 1:20:01.834
I wanna be happy.

1:20:02.458 --> 1:20:05.041
Well, I can’t help you with that.

1:20:05.041 --> 1:20:08.500
I respect your decision and if
you change you mind, let me know.

1:20:09.250 --> 1:20:10.417
I’m sorry it didn’t work out.

1:20:12.750 --> 1:20:13.583
I know.

1:20:14.542 --> 1:20:16.333
I'm sure our paths will cross again.

1:20:16.875 --> 1:20:17.792
I hope so.

1:20:19.583 --> 1:20:20.959
Take care Jason.

1:20:21.625 --> 1:20:22.458
Thanks, Diana.

1:20:23.500 --> 1:20:26.083
(somber music)

1:21:10.834 --> 1:21:11.834
- Mr. Jason.

1:21:14.542 --> 1:21:15.417
I have a question.

1:21:17.709 --> 1:21:20.000
- I'm sorry, class is over.

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:20.834
- Oh.

1:21:22.083 --> 1:21:24.834
- But I can stay if you
need some private tutoring.

1:21:26.041 --> 1:21:27.542
- Well I have a question

1:21:27.542 --> 1:21:29.542
about why you became a teacher.

1:21:31.834 --> 1:21:33.208
- Okay.

1:21:33.208 --> 1:21:34.875
- So I looked you up online

1:21:35.792 --> 1:21:37.583
and I thought it was kinda strange

1:21:37.583 --> 1:21:40.542
that you would go from a high paying job

1:21:40.542 --> 1:21:43.750
to a book deal that
made you even more money

1:21:43.750 --> 1:21:44.583
to a teacher?

1:21:45.458 --> 1:21:48.333
We all know that teachers
don't get paid very much.

1:21:48.333 --> 1:21:50.625
- Well, I will give you an A for research.

1:21:54.917 --> 1:21:57.959
I saved what I earned as a flight director

1:21:57.959 --> 1:22:02.834
and after a very successful
book deal, thank you, I retired.

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:06.875
- Doesn't look like you retired to me.

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:08.834
- This?

1:22:10.417 --> 1:22:11.291
This is fun.

1:22:12.417 --> 1:22:15.834
I get to get students like you excited

1:22:15.834 --> 1:22:17.375
about science and space

1:22:18.375 --> 1:22:20.458
and I'm working on book two.

1:22:20.458 --> 1:22:23.083
- Well, I'm a big fan of the first book.

1:22:24.458 --> 1:22:26.583
Where does Captain
Beansprout go this time?

1:22:28.041 --> 1:22:29.750
- I don't wanna give it away.

1:22:29.750 --> 1:22:30.709
- No.

1:22:30.709 --> 1:22:33.000
- But where no sprout has gone before.

1:22:35.500 --> 1:22:36.875
- I do have one complaint.

1:22:38.291 --> 1:22:39.125
- What?

1:22:40.250 --> 1:22:43.834
- Well, it just seems
that Captain Beansprout

1:22:43.834 --> 1:22:47.000
must be lonely, up in space all alone.

1:22:49.333 --> 1:22:51.083
Was there ever a co-captain Bean

1:22:52.208 --> 1:22:55.291
or a squash or a carrot?

1:22:56.792 --> 1:22:59.291
- Well, there was a co-captain Bean

1:23:00.125 --> 1:23:01.333
but it didn't work out.

1:23:03.709 --> 1:23:04.542
- Why not?

1:23:07.750 --> 1:23:09.542
- The captain didn't know what he wanted

1:23:09.542 --> 1:23:10.750
until it was too late.

1:23:12.333 --> 1:23:14.583
She ran off with some tomato.

1:23:16.875 --> 1:23:17.709
- Not a tomato.

1:23:23.458 --> 1:23:25.500
I would love to hear more about the book.

1:23:26.875 --> 1:23:28.375
Is there anyway that I can schedule

1:23:28.375 --> 1:23:29.500
some out of class time?

1:23:32.709 --> 1:23:34.291
- So how'd things go with Mitch?

1:23:37.250 --> 1:23:39.208
- We dated for a few months

1:23:39.208 --> 1:23:41.834
and then when he asked
me to move in with him,

1:23:41.834 --> 1:23:42.667
I panicked.

1:23:44.166 --> 1:23:45.000
Yeah.

1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.041
- Sort of like saying
I love you too early.

1:23:48.250 --> 1:23:49.208
- Right, yeah.

1:23:49.208 --> 1:23:50.500
Everything's about timing.

1:23:53.709 --> 1:23:56.333
- I'm sorry I threw up on
you at the Christmas party.

1:23:57.709 --> 1:23:59.250
- What?

1:23:59.250 --> 1:24:01.542
What made you think of that?

1:24:01.542 --> 1:24:04.959
(reflective piano music)

1:24:06.500 --> 1:24:08.917
- When I met your sister,

1:24:08.917 --> 1:24:11.208
she took great pleasure in reminding me.

1:24:12.875 --> 1:24:14.542
- Yeah, she's got an evil streak.

1:24:15.750 --> 1:24:16.583
She does.

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:20.417
- It's really good to see you, though.

1:24:21.625 --> 1:24:22.458
- You, too.

1:24:24.333 --> 1:24:25.166
