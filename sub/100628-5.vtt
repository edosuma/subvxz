If Gandhi's gonna tell me
that a goat

22:58.115 --> 23:00.117
has all the answers,
know what I'm gonna do?

23:00.291 --> 23:01.815
I'm gonna slice that goat open,

23:01.989 --> 23:04.600
and I'm gonna wear its entrails
like a chunky necklace.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.736
I have to kill you.

23:11.825 --> 23:14.480
Because it's what I do.
It's who I am.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.536
Isn't it?

23:27.710 --> 23:29.495
You know, you are
the first person

23:29.669 --> 23:31.322
that's been nice to me
in so long.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.847
Aw.I mean, you and Osama bin Laden.

23:34.021 --> 23:36.458
But to be fair,
he was only being nice to me

23:36.632 --> 23:38.504
because he wanted something.Oh, men.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.723
Exactly. Exactly.Mm-hm.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.899
Oh, Marilyn.
Who would've thought

23:43.073 --> 23:46.076
we'd have so much in common?Feeling better?

23:46.250 --> 23:47.948
I am, yeah.

23:50.472 --> 23:52.213
Wait, how long
have we been out here?

23:52.387 --> 23:55.085
I'm sure you have
better things to be doing.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.348
Well, I have
all the time in Haven.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.439
Which is none and lots.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.049
Okay.

24:02.223 --> 24:04.094
Anyways, thanks.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.966
It's the least I can do, Josh.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.968
You saved me.

24:08.142 --> 24:12.015
Again, you know that
I'm not that same Josh, right?

24:13.669 --> 24:15.410
I got a second chance here.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.892
Maybe it's time
you gave yourself one.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.026
Hm.

Hey! I was
in the middle of something.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.990
We gotta get back on mission.Oh, what?

24:30.164 --> 24:31.644
Buddy Holly wouldn't
let you play the tambo,

24:31.818 --> 24:33.602
and now you wanna bail?
Yeah, I saw that.

24:33.776 --> 24:37.432
No. Something's off here.
I did some snooping around.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.608
Shit ain't right.
So let's just get you home

24:39.782 --> 24:42.002
to your incredibly not weird
relationship with your parents.

24:42.176 --> 24:44.178
Well, hang on. Slow down.

24:44.352 --> 24:45.832
I feel like
people here are happy.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.529
Maybe us destroying this place

24:47.703 --> 24:49.139
for our own benefit is wrong.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.967
Wait a minute.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.927
Was Marilyn Monroe
just hitting on you?

Hi. Oh, you think?

Well, that's it.
Evil lurks here.

James Dean was hanging
on myevery word.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.993
Ugh, nobody likes
a name-dropper.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.518
You are jealous.

25:19.692 --> 25:22.303
Please, I've been jealous
of two people my whole life.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.174
Yeah. Gonna drop their names?No.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.176
Hm.But if I was,

25:26.350 --> 25:29.223
it'd be Alice Waters and
pre-born-again Kirk Cameron.

25:29.397 --> 25:32.008
Only 16 years old, and had
the whole town by the balls.

Lucky son of a--
