("I Ran (So Far Away)"
by A Flock of Seagulls playing)

00:16.917 --> 00:19.887
* I walked along the avenue *

00:19.920 --> 00:24.192
* I never thought
I'd meet a girl like you *

00:24.225 --> 00:27.695
* Meet a girl like you *

00:29.730 --> 00:32.066
* With auburn hair
and tawny eyes *

00:32.100 --> 00:35.369
* The kind of eyes that
hypnotize me through... *

00:35.403 --> 00:37.037
Looks like we can't
go any further.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.839
You sure this is where
you want to go?

00:38.872 --> 00:40.374
My GPS shows
there's nothing up there.

00:40.408 --> 00:44.044
Yeah, it must be where
the access road used to be.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.180
Looks like I'll have
to hike it from here.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.681
Thanks. I'll find it.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.718
-What are you looking for?
-Camp Redwood.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.186
Oh.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.921
* Night and day... *

00:53.954 --> 00:55.923
Don't forget to give me
five stars!

02:33.020 --> 02:35.022
(camera clicks)

02:53.374 --> 02:54.842
(camera clicking)

02:54.875 --> 02:56.176
MONTANA:
What's that?

02:56.210 --> 02:57.711
In your hand.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.081
Uh, it's my phone.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.483
That's not a phone.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.185
(scoffs)
Are-are you Amish or something?

03:05.219 --> 03:07.187
(titters)

03:07.221 --> 03:08.689
Can I?

03:08.722 --> 03:11.559
S-Sure.

03:11.592 --> 03:14.061
(gasps)
Oh, shit.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.529
That's rad.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.730
(tapping)

03:17.931 --> 03:18.999
(camera clicking)

03:19.032 --> 03:20.067
What year is this?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.869
Are you serious?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.070
Just tell me, asshole.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.939
It's 2019.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.008
Oh, my God.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.878
You're the first new guy I've
seen here in, like, forever.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.946
After that shitshow in '89,
I began to notice

03:32.980 --> 03:35.249
a lot less people
were coming into camp.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.185
Not even the hard-core
death tourists.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
Few years later, nobody.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.022
We were forgotten.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.692
Something else must have
gotten their attention.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.360
-Now I know what.
-I'm sorry.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.061
Were you even alive in 1989?

03:48.095 --> 03:50.464
And-and you said "We."

03:50.498 --> 03:52.099
Who-who else is here?

03:54.302 --> 03:56.704
You got to get out of here.
You're in danger.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.940
Everyone you see here
is likely to kill you.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.609
Including you?

04:03.777 --> 04:05.313
Can I keep this?

04:06.314 --> 04:07.581
No.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.982
There's no reception
up here anyway.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.919
And I'm not leaving,
not until I get some answers.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.922
I'm trying to find out
what happened to my father.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.490
I know he was here.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.926
Your father?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.961
My name is Bobby Richter.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.498
Bobby.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.800
You're Mr. Jingles' son.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.773
(crying softly)

05:38.271 --> 05:40.240
(music slows, distorts)

05:40.273 --> 05:41.609
(film projector clicking,
then shuts off)

06:06.434 --> 06:08.436
(laughs softly)

06:09.970 --> 06:11.939
I've done a lot
of research on this place

06:11.972 --> 06:14.942
and everything
that happened here.

06:14.975 --> 06:20.280
I know this sounds crazy,
but you look just like...

06:24.151 --> 06:26.119
MONTANA:
Ah. Yep. That's me.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.188
It's a headshot I did
for the aerobics studio.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.090
They put all the instructors'
mugs on the wall.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.391
BOBBY:
That's impossible.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.560
Montana Duke died.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.127
And even if she didn't,

06:34.161 --> 06:35.128
she'd be in her 50s.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.964
(album closes)

06:36.997 --> 06:38.899
What's going on here?

06:38.932 --> 06:40.601
I'll tell you, but you first.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.202
What's going on out there?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.971
We don't have TV here,
so we have no idea.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.807
What's the music like? What do
people do to stay in shape?

06:46.840 --> 06:47.741
Who's the president?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.880
Uh, what did people
think of the '80s?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.782
Did Judd Nelson
ever get his Oscar?

06:54.815 --> 06:58.051
Uh, no. I don't think so.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.954
Um, I don't know. The '80s are
having a little comeback now.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.056
I mean, people like the clothes

07:03.090 --> 07:06.594
and the music, but aerobics
is kind of a joke these days.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.996
Oh, come on, man.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.598
You break into this camp
just to break my heart?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.633
That is the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.001
(both laugh)

07:14.034 --> 07:15.569
MONTANA:
Mwah.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.605
You're-you're-you're-you're
Trevor Kirchner.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.173
You're the guy who was married
to Margaret Booth.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.076
You-you have, you have
an enormous, uh...

07:23.110 --> 07:25.813
Personality? Hey.
(chuckles)

07:25.846 --> 07:28.315
This doesn't make any sense.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.985
He's Mr. Jingles' son Bobby.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.821
Whoa.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.055
MONTANA:
Yeah.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.826
I was raised by my aunt.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.460
She died last year,
and on her deathbed

07:40.494 --> 07:42.530
she told me the truth
about my father.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.532
She said someone
murdered my mother

07:44.565 --> 07:47.034
and he came here
to avenge her death.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.969
She kept it a secret
so I'd be protected,

07:49.002 --> 07:52.172
but he was never
heard from again.

07:52.205 --> 07:56.376
I've also been receiving checks
all my life sent anonymously.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.878
And I think it's him.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.780
I think he's been sending me
money all these years

07:59.813 --> 08:03.517
and I just,
I-I have to talk to him.

08:05.352 --> 08:08.121
I'm sorry, dude.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.157
Your dad's dead.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.062
Well-- are you, are you sure?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.330
'Cause there-there's so much
about him that doesn't fit.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.867
I mean, the guy who worked
at VideoShack is not

08:19.900 --> 08:22.936
the same killer
that I've read so much about.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.974
Who was he?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.242
I don't think we'll ever know.

08:29.276 --> 08:33.046
He came back here to do good,
but dark forces took him away.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.883
The last time I saw him,
he was dragged into the lake.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.185
Haven't seen him since.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.319
None of the ghosts have.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.855
Ghosts?

08:41.889 --> 08:44.357
Yeah. We're all dead.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.860
This is such bullshit.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.062
-Ooh. Smart.
You brought protection.
-Hey! Hey... Hey.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.064
-Here, shoot me.
-In the head.
I got shot in the pecker once.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.000
-It stung like a bitch.
-Mm.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.068
-No, I'm not gonna shoot you.
-(Montana groans)

08:55.102 --> 08:56.536
You're such a pussy. Come on.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.405
(screams)

08:58.438 --> 09:00.908
TREVOR (laughs):
Me next, me next. Come on.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.410
Oh, come on...
What else you got?

09:03.443 --> 09:05.012
Here we go. Aw, a knife.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.614
Stab me. Come on.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.216
No.
(screams)

09:09.249 --> 09:11.719
(shouts)

09:11.752 --> 09:13.120
What?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.990
-Yo!
-(screams)

09:19.159 --> 09:21.561
What is happening?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.064
This doesn't make any sense.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.132
What's going on?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.034
It's a long story.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.037
It was Halloween 1989.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.205
Margaret Booth had
everything lined up.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.474
The stage was set
for a massacre.

09:45.185 --> 09:48.922
The talent was supposed
to be here 45 minutes ago.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.058
You're my attorney.
I want you to call their reps

09:51.091 --> 09:52.826
and find out
why they haven't shown.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.428
We have signed contracts, yes?

09:55.462 --> 09:57.731
Well, see to it that those
contracts are executed,

09:57.765 --> 10:01.134
because if they aren't,
you will be.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.303
ALEX: Wait. Does that mean
I don't get to kill

10:03.336 --> 10:04.504
Debbie Gibson?

10:04.537 --> 10:05.639
RAMIREZ:
I don't care

10:05.673 --> 10:07.174
about the openers.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.976
But I was promised Billy Idol.

10:09.009 --> 10:13.613
If he doesn't show, I'm going
to be very, very upset.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.984
I think I know
why the bands aren't here.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.318
And? Spit it out.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.519
It's Trevor.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.954
He's blocked the road.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.824
He's turning people around,
sending 'em away.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.159
I think he's trying
to shut us down.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.529
I personally had to say goodbye
to Belinda Carlisle.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.199
And why would he be doing that?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.836
Because he hates you.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.205
And he roots for your failure.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.975
And maybe I might have
accidentally told him

10:42.009 --> 10:44.778
about Kajagoogoo
getting murdered.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.614
You are the world's
worst assistant.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.982
Well, I wouldn't say
"the worst..."

10:51.752 --> 10:54.955
Clean this up. I have something
I have to go deal with.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.390
("Turn Up the Radio"
by Autograph playing)

10:57.424 --> 10:59.893
-(horns honking)
-* I'm working hard... *

10:59.927 --> 11:01.228
Yeah, I'm-I'm so sorry,

11:01.261 --> 11:03.063
but the fire department
has shut us down.

11:03.096 --> 11:06.133
I'm so sorry to say
the festival has been canceled.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.801
* Turn up... *

11:07.835 --> 11:10.170
Sorry, ladies. The fire
department shut us down.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.705
You're gonna have to get
the beat somewhere else.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.708
(wails)

11:14.742 --> 11:17.310
Yeah, the water main blew,
so the whole place is flooded.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.678
Sorry, no refunds.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.815
Sit and spin, asshole!

11:21.849 --> 11:25.318
(horn honking frantically)

11:25.352 --> 11:26.319
(tires screech)

11:26.353 --> 11:28.655
* Now listen. *

11:28.688 --> 11:29.823
-MARGARET: Trevor?!
-(air hisses)

11:29.857 --> 11:31.691
What the hell are you doing?!

11:31.725 --> 11:33.526
I know about Kajagoogoo.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.096
-That wasn't me.
-Either way, you're complicit.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.598
Am I supposed to be afraid
of that knife, Trevor, huh?

11:38.631 --> 11:40.233
Death is our business,

11:40.267 --> 11:42.202
a business you had
no moral objection to

11:42.235 --> 11:44.037
when it paid
for your Porsche 928

11:44.071 --> 11:46.439
and enough coke to keep
an elephant up for a week.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.674
Show's over.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.777
You are true evil.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.112
And I let myself be
corrupted by that evil,

11:52.145 --> 11:54.581
but this is my redemption song.

11:54.614 --> 11:58.118
For the first time in my life,
I have found real love,

11:58.151 --> 11:59.787
and it has freed me.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.921
I'm shutting you down, Margaret.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.689
I'm going to the authorities,

12:02.722 --> 12:05.092
and I am filing for divorce!

12:05.125 --> 12:08.695
Trevor, darling,
haven't you heard?

12:08.728 --> 12:12.132
People can run from me,
but they never get away.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.733
(screaming)

12:16.169 --> 12:17.404
I should've shot you
when I saw you

12:17.437 --> 12:20.540
rolling around with
that truck stop Cyndi Lauper.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.475
You murderous bitch.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.577
You'll never get away with this.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.879
Oh, yes, I will.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.047
Look around, ding-dong.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.882
You're not in
Camp Redwood anymore.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.717
You're on the other side
of the property line.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.254
So if you die here,
dead is all you'll ever be,

12:34.287 --> 12:36.957
and you will never see
that bitch again.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.558
(yelling)

12:38.591 --> 12:41.628
(screaming, sobbing)

12:42.695 --> 12:45.132
Thanks for nothing, fuck-face!

12:45.165 --> 12:46.800
Wow.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.135
And I should've died,

12:48.168 --> 12:50.537
but fate had other plans for me.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.474
No! No!

12:54.507 --> 12:55.809
Trevor!

12:55.843 --> 12:57.077
-Trevor!
-(grunts weakly)

12:57.110 --> 12:58.511
Trevor, can you hear me?

12:58.545 --> 13:01.114
-Montana...
-Trevor, please get up.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.183
-Please.
You can't die out there.
-(pained groan)

13:03.216 --> 13:05.085
Please!

13:05.118 --> 13:06.653
Please...

13:06.686 --> 13:08.989
-(grunting)
-Trevor! Come on, baby,

13:09.022 --> 13:10.157
you can do it.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.491
-You can do it, baby.
-(yells)

13:12.860 --> 13:14.361
Come on, Trev.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.429
Trevor, come on, baby,
just a few more feet.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.032
-Just a few more.
-(sobbing)

13:19.066 --> 13:21.969
Come on. Trevor, you can do it.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.204
(crying):
I'm sorry.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.007
I'm sorry.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.076
(crying)

13:34.214 --> 13:36.416
Don't you dare
fucking touch him.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.354
(sighs)

13:41.388 --> 13:44.057
-You're not gonna make it.
-Leave him alone!

13:44.091 --> 13:46.193
You already took my brother!
Don't you dare take

13:46.226 --> 13:48.228
the best dick
that happened to me!

13:50.397 --> 13:51.965
(whispers):
Come on.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.967
(crying):
No, Trevor.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.004
(both grunting)

13:57.037 --> 13:59.106
Okay, come on.

14:04.077 --> 14:04.912
Trevor.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.851
Why would you help me?

14:11.885 --> 14:14.087
Because I'm not like you.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.530
(stammering, panting)

14:23.563 --> 14:25.232
It's okay, babe.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.567
You can go. You can go.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.502
(panting stops)

14:29.536 --> 14:32.305
TREVOR (distorted):
You saved me, babe.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.076
(Montana gasping)

14:39.079 --> 14:40.113
Wait, so...

14:40.147 --> 14:43.150
Brooke Thompson escaped
death row?

14:44.784 --> 14:47.087
I'd hated her for so long.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.689
And she knew it, too.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.691
But she saved him anyway.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.094
And that simple act...

14:54.127 --> 14:56.096
it changed me forever.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.098
She was right.

14:58.131 --> 15:01.868
All that hatred had turned me
into a terrible person.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.770
And I didn't want to be
like that anymore.

15:03.803 --> 15:07.074
I decided all the killing
had to stop.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.308
The ghosts we could reason with.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.776
We all had our differences,

15:09.809 --> 15:11.911
but we shared the same fate.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.613
You know?
So it bonded us.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.149
We became a community.

15:16.183 --> 15:19.486
It was Margaret's bloodlust
that we needed to end.

15:19.519 --> 15:24.191
Problem was, she was working
with two very dangerous men.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.160
(pained grunting)

15:32.665 --> 15:34.167
(pants)

15:34.201 --> 15:36.203
You're my seventh solo kill.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.171
Die, bitch.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.640
(Trevor yells)

15:40.673 --> 15:42.009
(quiet choking)

15:42.042 --> 15:44.844
Looks like
it's only gonna be six.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.181
Sorry, hombre.

15:48.215 --> 15:51.418
Bitchin' 'stache, but I can't
have you die on this property.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.753
You're gonna rot
in the Angeles Forest.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.621
Public land.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.624
(grunting)

15:57.657 --> 16:00.027
(body thumping)

16:00.060 --> 16:01.894
(body thuds, grunting stops)

16:06.133 --> 16:07.434
Killing that asshole was easy.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.968
No muss, no fuss.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.139
But... Ramirez was
a different monster.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.143
MONTANA:
Ricky. Is that you?

16:19.546 --> 16:22.182
Montana.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.284
(chuckles):
Holy shit, babe.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.619
I can't believe
you're actually here.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.022
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.158
I've missed you, too.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.459
But the festival seems
like a bust,

16:32.492 --> 16:35.028
so I'm gonna go kill
this kid in Alaska.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.297
(gasping softly)

16:37.330 --> 16:39.066
(whispers):
That's too bad.

16:39.099 --> 16:43.470
'Cause there hasn't been
a real man up here in so long.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.472
-(rasping exhale)
-Not here.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.040
I got a better place.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.309
Get ready to lose
your shit, babe.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.977
-(chuckles)
-'Cause Billy Idol

16:51.010 --> 16:52.412
wants to meet you.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.082
-He's a huge fan.
-Mm.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.085
I know about the roadblock.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.053
I know that Idol isn't here.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.721
Dude, he freaking
made it through,

17:01.754 --> 17:04.023
because Billy Idol is
a survivor!

17:04.057 --> 17:05.558
Come on, think about it.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.395
You can't sing "Rebel Yell"
and not be a rebel.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.200
-Oh.
-Yeah.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.001
Babe, sorry.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.669
Everybody's always coming
for the king,

17:16.703 --> 17:18.338
so I got to be on my guard.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.273
I get it. Come on.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.041
Billy's waiting.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.026
So, where's Billy?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.461
He's coming.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.131
(door closes, lock clacks)

17:45.932 --> 17:47.700
Aw, fuck me.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.801
-(blade stabs)
-(grunts)

17:48.835 --> 17:50.803
This is my redemption, dickwad.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.805
I'm gonna be the one to end you.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.641
(pulls out blade)

17:56.243 --> 17:57.744
(Ramirez gasps)

17:57.777 --> 17:59.112
(grunts)

17:59.146 --> 18:01.414
-You bitch!
-And you're a sick fuck

18:01.448 --> 18:03.783
who gets his rocks off
slicing up grannies.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.653
Does that make you feel
like a man? You're pathetic!

18:06.686 --> 18:08.121
We're gonna make you pay
for all of eternity

18:08.155 --> 18:09.756
-for all the fucked-up shit
you've done.
-(growls)

18:09.789 --> 18:10.990
-(spits)
-(yells)

18:11.023 --> 18:13.560
-You're not supposed to be here!
-(yells)

18:13.593 --> 18:15.962
(Montana yells)

18:15.995 --> 18:17.397
(distorted yell)

18:17.430 --> 18:20.633
(distorted,
echoing grunting, yelling)

18:27.006 --> 18:28.141
-Whoo!
-Yeah!

18:28.175 --> 18:31.110
-(choking)
-(laughing)

18:31.144 --> 18:33.112
I'll come back.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.616
I'll come back...

18:36.649 --> 18:38.151
for all of you.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.452
No.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.188
-I'm counting on it.
-(slices)

18:41.221 --> 18:42.489
(Montana yelling)

18:44.491 --> 18:45.858
(grunts)

18:46.893 --> 18:48.127
(laughing)

18:48.161 --> 18:50.197
(man whoops)

18:58.171 --> 19:01.541
But why didn't you make sure
that he died outside of camp?

19:01.574 --> 19:02.975
Why...

19:03.009 --> 19:05.678
trap his soul in here
with all of you?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.947
Ramirez already died once
back in '84,

19:07.980 --> 19:10.149
and the devil
brought him right back to life.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.219
In minutes,
he was flesh and blood again.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.188
As in, he could moonwalk
right out of this place,

19:15.222 --> 19:17.023
-go anywhere.
-If we were gonna keep

19:17.056 --> 19:19.125
Beelzefuck from fully
reincarnating the prick,

19:19.158 --> 19:22.229
Ramirez was gonna need to be
under constant supervision.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.632
So for 30 straight years, that's
exactly what we've given him.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.200
(gasps, pants)

19:27.234 --> 19:29.001
A literal death watch.

19:29.035 --> 19:32.004
There are over 40 souls here.
We all take turns.

19:32.038 --> 19:35.342
The second he wakes, we're
on him like flies on shit.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.244
RAY:
Good morning.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.513
-(gasps)
-(grunts)

19:40.547 --> 19:42.282
(yells, sobs)

19:45.285 --> 19:47.320
(Ramirez gasping loudly)

19:47.354 --> 19:49.088
(growls)

19:49.121 --> 19:52.225
Dark Father, heal my wounds.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.860
Give me strength

19:53.893 --> 19:55.895
-to devour...
-(blade stabs)

19:55.928 --> 19:59.031
From here on out, all
you're ever gonna feel is pain.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.341
MONTANA:
We're constantly coming up

20:08.375 --> 20:10.109
with new horrible ways
to kill him.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.545
After all the dreadful shit
he did to so many people,

20:12.579 --> 20:13.946
he deserves to suffer.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.482
(grunts, pants)

20:17.250 --> 20:19.085
Fuck.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.019
(both grunt)

20:20.052 --> 20:21.521
(revving motor)

20:21.554 --> 20:23.456
(screaming)

20:24.791 --> 20:26.893
TREVOR (sighs):
So...

20:26.926 --> 20:29.429
that's how we've been able
to keep him at bay.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.931
We're doing this
to keep you safe.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.734
Me?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.969
You're the first person
he'd come for.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.372
The son of Jingles
he swore to kill.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.107
The boy in Alaska.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.742
And he wouldn't just kill you.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.110
He'd make you suffer.

20:44.143 --> 20:47.079
Your dad wanted you protected
from Ramirez,

20:47.113 --> 20:50.216
-and so we took up the mantle.
-Wait.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.051
So...

20:52.084 --> 20:54.654
(chuckles quietly)
all this time,

20:54.687 --> 20:56.423
all these years, you've...

20:56.456 --> 20:58.224
you've been saving my life?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.659
Yeah.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.298
Thank you.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.999
It's no big deal.

21:08.535 --> 21:11.304
What really matters is
that we get you out of here.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.773
This is the worst possible place
you could be.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.443
Well, I appreciate what you've
done for me, but you're wrong.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.844
I mean, if no one dies here,

21:17.877 --> 21:19.846
that means
I can actually talk to my dad.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.014
What part of "we haven't
seen him" don't you get?

21:22.048 --> 21:25.217
He's been MIA for, like,
30 years, dude.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.821
I'm not leaving.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.157
Not until I find him.

21:45.071 --> 21:48.040
(groans) Seems like
he's taking longer to wake up.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.878
Probably get another round
of Pictionary in.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.747
(both sigh)

21:56.683 --> 21:59.519
What do you say
we make it interesting?

21:59.552 --> 22:00.820
Like, um...

22:00.853 --> 22:02.955
loser has to strip?

22:02.989 --> 22:04.256
(chuckles)

22:06.726 --> 22:08.327
Mm.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.498
(laughs):
You can't be serious.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.566
As a heart attack, stud muffin.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.068
Now, pick a card,
start scribbling, and...

22:16.102 --> 22:18.170
maybe you'll get lucky.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.174
Not like I don't know
you swing both ways.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.076
Why would you say that?

22:24.110 --> 22:25.945
Because you sleep with everyone.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.681
What can I say?

22:28.715 --> 22:30.583
I'm an equal opportunity lover.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.151
Hmm.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.921
All the years we've been here,
you've never...

22:34.954 --> 22:36.856
thought about...

22:36.889 --> 22:39.025
tangling
with someone more mature?

22:39.058 --> 22:41.160
Someone who could teach you
a thing...

22:41.193 --> 22:43.195
or three?

22:44.130 --> 22:46.833
What are you afraid of?

22:46.866 --> 22:49.101
That you'll open Pandora's box,

22:49.135 --> 22:51.438
which you will never want
to close?

22:54.106 --> 22:56.008
VOICES (echoing):
Vengeance. Vengeance.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.412
Vengeance.
Vengeance.

23:05.485 --> 23:10.356
Seems like you two opened
that Pandora's Box after all.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.357
BOTH:
Oh, shit.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.092
(all scream)

23:14.293 --> 23:15.895
BOBBY:
I mean, if no one dies here,

23:15.928 --> 23:17.597
that means I can actually
talk to my dad.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.766
MONTANA:
What part of "we haven't seen
him" don't you get?

23:19.799 --> 23:23.570
BOBBY:
I'm not leaving,
not until I find him.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.572
Okay, I understand
your need for closure.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.206
But even if you do find him,

23:27.239 --> 23:30.109
I'm not really sure
that Mr. Jingles

23:30.142 --> 23:31.310
is gonna give you
the warm and fuzzies

23:31.343 --> 23:32.579
that you're looking for.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.082
I have to try.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.484
(yelling)

23:39.151 --> 23:40.920
(grunting)

23:40.953 --> 23:43.656
Run, Bobby, run, he's the Night
Stalker! Come on!

23:43.690 --> 23:45.024
(grunting)

23:50.362 --> 23:52.732
The fuck, dude?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.000
(groans)

23:55.768 --> 23:58.137
(Montana screams)

23:58.170 --> 24:00.006
Shit! Somebody fucked up.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.574
(Ramirez grunts)

24:01.608 --> 24:04.343
-Keep it moving, sweetheart.
-Die, motherfucker!

24:04.376 --> 24:06.345
MONTANA:
Run, Bobby, run!

24:06.378 --> 24:09.115
(all grunting)

24:11.217 --> 24:13.620
-VOICES (echoing): Vengeance.
-(screams)

24:14.554 --> 24:17.156
(grunts)

24:17.189 --> 24:20.059
(panting)

24:25.197 --> 24:26.866
(grunting)

24:29.068 --> 24:31.470
(laughs)

24:31.504 --> 24:33.172
You're just like your dad.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.174
You fight like a pussy.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.176
(both grunting)

24:43.382 --> 24:45.484
Your father betrayed Satan.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.820
I'm here to collect his debt.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.056
It's going to be lots of fun.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.224
Not so much for you.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.127
-Get him!
-MONTANA: Listen to me.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.196
-Run and never come back.
Come on.
-No.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.999
Go to Red Meadows Asylum.
Find the medical director,

25:00.032 --> 25:02.134
and you'll get your answer.
Go, Bobby!

25:02.168 --> 25:04.170
(indistinct shouting)

25:22.388 --> 25:24.757
(keys clacking)

25:24.791 --> 25:26.793
-(door opens)
-(Bobby panting)

25:31.698 --> 25:35.067
I need to see
the medical director.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.103
(chuckles): Yo, you're
in the wrong kind of hospital.

25:37.136 --> 25:40.172
-This ain't no ER.
-I'm fine. Please.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.008
It's very important.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.176
She's kind of indisposed
right now.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.444
Maybe I could take a message?

25:45.477 --> 25:46.646
No!

25:47.947 --> 25:49.916
I'm sorry.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.451
I've-I've had a very long day,
and I just need

25:52.484 --> 25:53.920
a few minutes of her time.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.221
Please.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.056
Okay. No problem.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.625
Have a seat over there.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.093
I'll see what I can do.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.763
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

26:05.264 --> 26:06.966
(phone dials)

26:06.999 --> 26:08.234
(line rings)

26:08.267 --> 26:09.802
Hi. It's Jess.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.638
I got a guy here in the lobby.

26:11.671 --> 26:14.306
Someone that needs
your attention.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.743
-Thank you.
-(phone hangs up)

26:16.776 --> 26:18.778
(sighs)

26:32.659 --> 26:34.627
(door opens)

26:34.661 --> 26:36.763
Take it easy now.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.497
Just gonna get you cleaned up.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.232
What?

26:40.266 --> 26:41.968
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.435
I'm not...
I'm not here for that.

26:43.469 --> 26:44.503
I'm just here
to get some information.

26:44.536 --> 26:45.604
You're in good company.

26:45.638 --> 26:46.839
Lot of people here
looking for information.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.641
Frequencies. Chupacabras.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.143
-Fun group.
-Listen, it's about
Benjamin Richter.

26:51.177 --> 26:54.446
Wait. What about Richter?

26:55.782 --> 26:57.750
He was my father.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.585
RITA:
I knew your father.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.620
You did?

27:01.654 --> 27:03.656
How?

27:03.690 --> 27:06.959
How doesn't matter.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.829
What matters is
that you know this.

27:09.862 --> 27:13.065
When they locked him up in here,
they locked up an innocent man.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.936
But, uh,
there was so much evidence.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.638
Evidence planted
by the real killer.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.540
Margaret Booth.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.043
Margaret Booth.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.812
But she-she was...
she was a victim.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.715
She testified at the trial.
She was missing an ear.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.117
She was thorough.
I'll give her that.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.819
Opportunistic.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.822
Smart. A straight up psychopath.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.289
Put all that into a blender,

27:37.323 --> 27:39.625
and you got one of
the most vicious serial killers

27:39.658 --> 27:41.227
of the 20th century.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.062
And she almost got away with it.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.064
Almost.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.066
(sighs)

27:47.099 --> 27:49.802
Until that Halloween night

27:49.836 --> 27:52.004
-in 1989.
-MARGARET: No.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.672
No, no, no.
I cannot wait any longer.

27:53.706 --> 27:54.841
I need someone to come.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.076
I need someone
to move that bus right now.

27:57.109 --> 27:59.578
-(line disconnects)
-Hel... Hello?

27:59.611 --> 28:03.115
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Hello?

28:07.186 --> 28:09.421
MAN:
Margaret Booth.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.550
Oh, shit.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.729
-(grunts)
-(screams)

28:50.763 --> 28:53.199
What the fuck
are you doing here?!

28:53.232 --> 28:55.201
-To kill you, you crazy bitch.
-(screams)

28:55.234 --> 28:56.302
(grunting)

29:09.415 --> 29:11.150
-Bitch!
-(gasps)

29:11.183 --> 29:12.284
(screaming)

29:13.452 --> 29:14.420
No!

29:14.453 --> 29:16.789
(gunshot)

29:20.827 --> 29:23.662
No!
(screams)

29:31.003 --> 29:32.771
-Take her.
-MARGARET: No, no, no, no, no!

29:32.805 --> 29:35.141
We can talk about this.
Just tell me what you want.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.575
Your head on a stick.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.610
(groans)

29:48.387 --> 29:49.688
(engine whirring)

29:51.657 --> 29:54.160
TREVOR:
Hold her steady, boys.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.461
You can't kill me here.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.229
You'll just turn me
into one of you.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.000
Way ahead of you, Mags.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.202
(screaming)

30:03.235 --> 30:05.804
(chuckling)

30:05.838 --> 30:08.007
Shoot her
over the property line.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.779
Oh, my, my.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.647
This is so gratifying.

30:15.681 --> 30:18.384
Is there a puree setting on it?

30:18.417 --> 30:20.519
-(Margaret screaming)
-(Xavier and Chet grunting)

30:23.222 --> 30:24.823
(chuckles)

30:30.596 --> 30:32.999
(laughter)

30:33.032 --> 30:35.067
You're too late.

30:35.101 --> 30:38.004
I'm already dying.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.873
MONTANA:
Actually, the brain

30:40.907 --> 30:43.575
can live on for about 30 seconds
after decapitation.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.554
Oh!

30:55.587 --> 30:58.991
What the fuck?

30:59.025 --> 31:02.161
Margaret finally got
what she had coming to her.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.097
I just wish Brooke
was alive to see it.

31:05.131 --> 31:07.166
So, then, Brooke...

31:07.199 --> 31:10.202
was a patsy just like my dad.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.438
I tried to do right by her.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.440
Give her a new life.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.708
But she just couldn't outrun

31:16.742 --> 31:19.178
what happened to her
at that camp.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.113
It pulled her back in

31:21.147 --> 31:23.115
and eventually it killed her.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.418
So you were the last one.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.454
The only one.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.891
The final girl.

31:32.925 --> 31:35.627
I went back a few times

31:35.661 --> 31:38.564
to check in, pay my respects.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.733
But it was hard for them
seeing someone like me

31:41.767 --> 31:45.371
that could change, grow old.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.673
Someone with a life.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.547
Thank you.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.750
Telling you the truth
is the least I can do.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.286
I mean for the money.

32:00.319 --> 32:01.753
The checks.

32:01.787 --> 32:03.722
All this time, I thought
it was my dad sending them,

32:03.755 --> 32:05.491
but it was you, wasn't it?

32:05.524 --> 32:07.293
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.028
I never sent you anything.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.766
Well, then, there must be
someone else who knows.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.203
Someone else who made it out.

32:19.538 --> 32:22.474
Maybe you weren't
the final girl after all.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.302
Oh.

32:50.336 --> 32:53.139
Oh, Christ.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.007
Oh, I could never live here.

32:55.041 --> 32:58.144
Changed my socks twice already.

32:58.177 --> 33:01.747
(sighs)
Recognize anyone?

33:03.015 --> 33:05.117
Any chance
we have the wrong address?

33:05.151 --> 33:07.053
No chance.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.620
The routing number
on your checks

33:08.654 --> 33:10.389
is a small savings and loan.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.957
Only one branch,

33:11.990 --> 33:14.026
and it's right here
in Prineville, Oregon.

33:14.060 --> 33:16.062
Why are you doing this for me?

33:17.063 --> 33:19.065
Who says I'm doing this for you?

33:19.098 --> 33:21.100
(chuckles softly)

33:23.035 --> 33:24.903
Oh.

33:24.936 --> 33:27.106
Bogey coming in.

33:32.944 --> 33:35.947
Oh, my God.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.527
(doorbell rings)

33:55.067 --> 33:56.368
(Brooke chuckles softly)

34:00.472 --> 34:02.941
What took you so long?

34:07.379 --> 34:10.749
Here we go. Sorry,
I don't have real sugar.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.718
Just Splenda.
(chuckles)

34:12.751 --> 34:15.121
Black's fine for me, thanks.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.756
Is that how you stay
looking the way you do

34:17.789 --> 34:19.958
after 30 years? Splenda?

34:19.991 --> 34:22.594
Turns out leaving behind

34:22.628 --> 34:24.196
a life of hostility

34:24.230 --> 34:25.731
and revenge
does wonders for your skin.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.533
And having
a dermatologist husband

34:27.566 --> 34:29.135
doesn't hurt either.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.069
(chuckles)

34:31.103 --> 34:34.106
I took all the stress
that was pumping through my body

34:34.140 --> 34:36.175
and swapped it
for premium fillers.

34:37.176 --> 34:40.479
I'm kidding. Kind of.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.381
(sighs)

34:42.414 --> 34:45.651
Looks like you broke yourself
off a nice slice of life here.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.719
Doctor husband,

34:47.753 --> 34:49.321
good-looking kids.

34:50.356 --> 34:52.758
Donna, I-I know I...

34:52.791 --> 34:54.493
I owe you an apology.

34:54.526 --> 34:57.163
Do you have any idea how much
guilt I was carrying around

34:57.196 --> 34:58.964
after I left you at that place?

34:58.997 --> 35:01.600
How could you not let me know
you were alive?

35:01.633 --> 35:03.135
I did. I-I called.

35:03.169 --> 35:06.472
I just...
could never say "hello."

35:06.505 --> 35:09.441
As soon as I heard your voice,
I'd start shaking.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.977
The memories of Redwood
would come flooding back in.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.980
I hung up every time.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.015
But there wasn't a day
that went by

35:17.048 --> 35:20.085
that I didn't think of you.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.421
And I'm sorry.
I just... I didn't know

35:22.454 --> 35:25.957
any other way to move on.

35:25.991 --> 35:29.027
I'm not mad at you
for having a good life.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.363
I just wish
I could've been a part of it.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.632
(sighs)
Yeah.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.468
And I'll be damned if I can
figure out how you got out.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.471
I watched you die.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.475
(Margaret screams)

35:47.313 --> 35:49.481
(gasps)

35:51.717 --> 35:54.220
No, Brooke. No.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.854
(panting)

36:08.066 --> 36:09.335
(gasps, coughs)

36:09.368 --> 36:11.403
(wheezes, coughs)

36:11.437 --> 36:13.539
You're alive.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.073
(coughs)

36:15.106 --> 36:16.342
(whimpering)

36:18.444 --> 36:19.911
(yelps)

36:19.945 --> 36:22.047
Ah, the bullet
went right through.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.882
Okay, just keep pressure here,
okay?

36:23.915 --> 36:26.051
Hold it tight. I'll get you

36:26.084 --> 36:28.186
-some bandages.
-And iodine.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.156
And iodine.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.891
I remember.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.160
(crying)

36:35.193 --> 36:37.696
(Ray panting)

36:37.729 --> 36:40.165
(groaning)

36:40.198 --> 36:42.100
(panting)

36:43.134 --> 36:44.570
-(whimpers)
-Come on.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.738
(screaming)

36:46.772 --> 36:48.474
It's all right.
It's all right.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.279
-All right.
-I don't want to die here.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.513
You're not gonna die here.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.181
-(groans)
-You deserve better.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.284
You always have. Come on.

37:00.151 --> 37:03.221
-(groans)
-All right, come on.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.991
(Brooke panting)

37:09.160 --> 37:11.530
I can't help you any further.

37:11.563 --> 37:15.534
You got to get across
on your own.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.069
(panting)

37:18.103 --> 37:20.406
I'm sorry you have to stay here.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.841
You don't deserve this, either.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.288
Thank you.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.290
(whimpers)

37:38.324 --> 37:40.959
(panting, sniffling)

37:45.263 --> 37:46.765
Oh.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.667
(Ray screams, echoing)

37:50.602 --> 37:53.305
I woke up in a white room.

37:53.339 --> 37:57.976
I thought it was heaven
until I felt all of this pain.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.011
I guess someone called
from the camp pay phone,

38:00.045 --> 38:01.613
and paramedics got me
to the hospital.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.615
As soon
as I got my strength back,

38:03.649 --> 38:07.653
I got out of there,
headed north and kept going.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.856
You've always been a fighter.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.358
I should've known better

38:12.391 --> 38:14.092
-than to count you out.
-(laughs softly)

38:14.125 --> 38:16.695
No, but I still
don't understand.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.196
I mean, what...?

38:18.229 --> 38:21.199
After all my father did to you,
why did you help me?

38:21.232 --> 38:25.637
Why did you seek me out and
send me money all these years?

38:25.671 --> 38:27.639
I-I know
it's-it's hard to understand,

38:27.673 --> 38:30.108
but... I needed to believe

38:30.141 --> 38:33.044
that a normal life was possible
after Camp Redwood.

38:33.078 --> 38:36.982
A glimmer of hope
after all that darkness.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.284
Your dad was that for me.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.320
He moved to Alaska, got married,

38:42.354 --> 38:44.155
had a baby.

38:44.189 --> 38:47.158
He was on his way,
and the camp pulled him back,

38:47.192 --> 38:50.462
just like it pulled me back
when I had a chance to be free.

38:50.496 --> 38:53.365
And I knew that eventually

38:53.399 --> 38:55.667
it would pull you in, too,

38:55.701 --> 38:57.703
so I did what I could
to give you

38:57.736 --> 39:01.139
a chance to be free
of that awful legacy.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.974
So I guess, in the end,

39:03.008 --> 39:05.777
I did it for me
just as much as for you.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.914
Thank you.

39:12.083 --> 39:15.787
Donna, I hope
some day you can forgive me.

39:20.526 --> 39:22.694
We're bonded for life.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.730
We're the ones that got away.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.766
Yeah.

39:29.968 --> 39:31.970
(sighs)

39:34.139 --> 39:36.041
I guess
we're both the final girl.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.308
(laughs)

39:43.081 --> 39:44.950
Come on.

39:44.983 --> 39:47.252
-I'll buy you lunch.
-Nah, it's okay.

39:47.285 --> 39:50.355
You're going back
to that camp, aren't you?

39:50.388 --> 39:52.591
I felt something
when I was there,

39:52.624 --> 39:55.727
like...
someone watching over me.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.796
Um, I don't know.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.598
Maybe it was him.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.900
Brooke was right.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.803
Once that place has a hold
on you, it never lets go.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.138
You're not gonna find
what you're looking for.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.409
Thanks for all your help,
Donna.

40:30.161 --> 40:32.498
(birds singing)

40:55.020 --> 40:57.122
MARGARET:
Hello.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.691
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

41:00.826 --> 41:02.761
I know you.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.997
Does anyone really
ever know anyone?

41:07.232 --> 41:09.367
You're Margaret Booth.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.469
You framed my father.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.338
You're Jingles Junior.

41:13.371 --> 41:16.041
Did you come back here
to find your father?

41:16.074 --> 41:18.009
I can take you to him.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.979
They said no one's seen him
for 30 years.

41:21.012 --> 41:25.817
Well, not everyone can find him,
but we have a long history.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.686
I don't trust you.

41:27.719 --> 41:30.388
Okay, don't see your father.

41:30.421 --> 41:32.423
I don't care.

41:40.566 --> 41:42.534
They told me they killed you.

41:42.568 --> 41:44.836
So you couldn't come back.

41:44.870 --> 41:46.137
Well, technically, I died

41:46.171 --> 41:47.973
a second
before the chipper spit me out

41:48.006 --> 41:51.076
on the other side,
so I've been here all along.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.678
But I've been hiding.

41:52.711 --> 41:55.614
-And waiting.
-For what?

41:57.849 --> 42:00.085
To kill you!

42:00.118 --> 42:01.920
Fuck!

42:01.953 --> 42:03.221
You always found a way
to hurt me.

42:03.254 --> 42:06.224
You think
I would let you hurt my son?

42:06.257 --> 42:07.793
(Margaret groans)

42:14.800 --> 42:16.768
She'll be back.

42:16.802 --> 42:18.970
We have to get you
out of here now.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.042
(Bobby sniffles)

42:24.075 --> 42:26.678
-Dad.
-(gasps)

42:26.712 --> 42:29.347
(sniffles)

42:29.380 --> 42:31.382
Why did you come back here?

42:33.051 --> 42:35.353
I was never a parent to you.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.355
You're wrong. You-you...

42:37.388 --> 42:40.158
You did what
all good parents do. You...

42:41.492 --> 42:44.229
You sacrificed yourself
for your child.

42:44.262 --> 42:46.898
I just had to come back
and say "thank you."

42:48.099 --> 42:50.636
You are worth it.

42:50.669 --> 42:52.738
Every bit of it.

42:52.771 --> 42:55.240
Now forget this place

42:55.273 --> 42:57.342
and go live.

43:01.012 --> 43:04.049
And know I will always love you.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.818
That's all that matters, okay?

43:06.852 --> 43:09.187
(gasps, groans)

43:09.988 --> 43:11.489
Don't you get it?

43:11.522 --> 43:13.725
This is how it has to be.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.494
I win! I am the final girl.

43:16.527 --> 43:18.163
I am always the final girl.

43:18.196 --> 43:19.464
(Bobby groans)

43:21.667 --> 43:23.001
(Bobby gasps)

43:24.169 --> 43:26.037
Leave him alone.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.742
He deserves a happy ending.

43:30.776 --> 43:32.944
Why? Because he's innocent?

43:32.978 --> 43:35.781
Please. There is no such thing.

43:43.989 --> 43:45.957
So handsome.

43:45.991 --> 43:49.327
Just like my Bobby would have
looked if he'd grown up.

43:58.069 --> 44:00.405
(guttural gasping)

44:02.841 --> 44:04.843
Take her.

44:06.878 --> 44:09.815
Get out of here
and never come back.

44:09.848 --> 44:11.817
But don't forget us.

44:11.850 --> 44:13.819
Tell our ghost stories
to your children,

44:13.852 --> 44:15.486
and we'll live on forever.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.488
The '80s will never die.

44:17.522 --> 44:18.990
Now get out of here.

44:19.024 --> 44:22.227
Go, Bobby, go.

44:24.896 --> 44:27.999
("The Living Years" by
Mike + The Mechanics playing)

44:28.033 --> 44:30.035
(panting)

44:34.272 --> 44:37.475
* Every generation *

44:37.508 --> 44:39.244
(panting)

44:39.277 --> 44:42.247
* Blames the one before *

44:42.280 --> 44:43.915
(panting)

44:43.949 --> 44:48.019
* And all
of their frustrations *

44:48.053 --> 44:52.023
* Come beating on your door *

44:53.424 --> 44:55.827
* I know that I'm a prisoner *

44:55.861 --> 44:58.830
* To all
my father held so dear *

44:58.864 --> 45:01.066
* I know that I'm a hostage *

45:01.099 --> 45:03.034
* To all his hopes and fears *

45:03.068 --> 45:06.104
* I just wish
I could have told him *

45:06.137 --> 45:09.775
* In the living years *

45:09.808 --> 45:12.243
* So say it *

45:12.277 --> 45:17.115
-* Say it, say it loud *
-* Say it loud *

45:17.148 --> 45:19.084
* Say it clear *

45:19.117 --> 45:21.787
* Come on, say it clear *

45:21.820 --> 45:25.123
* You can listen *

45:25.156 --> 45:30.628
* As well as you hear *

45:31.930 --> 45:34.565
* It's too late *

45:34.599 --> 45:36.601
* It's
too late *

45:36.634 --> 45:37.969
* When we die *

45:38.003 --> 45:41.139
* It's too late when we die *

45:41.172 --> 45:43.741
* To admit *

45:43.775 --> 45:49.915
* We don't see eye to eye *

45:49.948 --> 45:51.917
* Hey, so say it, say it *

45:51.950 --> 45:54.152
-* Say it loud *
-* Say it loud *

45:54.185 --> 45:56.054
* Say it loud *

45:56.087 --> 45:58.056
* Say it clear *

45:58.089 --> 46:00.358
* Come on, say it clear. *
