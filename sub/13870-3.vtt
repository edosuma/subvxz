00:04.188 --> 00:06.146
Yes, I think it's a brilliant idea.

00:06.147 --> 00:08.193
From this moment on,
I am going to be the farm manager.

00:08.194 --> 00:11.133
Don't expect everyone
to welcome these changes.

00:11.134 --> 00:12.176
No good will come of this.

00:12.177 --> 00:14.216
I want your baby, Nathan Appleby.

00:14.217 --> 00:18.138
For you and Mr Appleby,
to help you get with child.

00:18.139 --> 00:19.157
Do you believe in ghosts?

00:19.158 --> 00:22.196
In all your years of dealing with the
dead and the dying and the bereaved,

00:22.197 --> 00:25.154
have you ever seen anything
that you could not explain?

00:25.155 --> 00:26.205
Never.

00:26.206 --> 00:30.146
GWEN: I used to hear a boy's laughter in
the house. Then one day, no more laughter.

00:30.147 --> 00:31.196
Gabriel... They've seen him.

00:31.197 --> 00:35.203
Are you seriously telling me
you all saw a ghost?

00:35.204 --> 00:39.154
When I was looking for Charlie,
I saw lights rushing towards me.

00:39.155 --> 00:41.110
CHARLOTTE: Charlie's missing.

00:41.111 --> 00:42.180
SHE WAILS

00:44.165 --> 00:47.203
There are no ghosts.
There's just you and me.

# Do not cross the hayfield

00:59.151 --> 01:02.168
# The hayfield, the hayfield

01:02.169 --> 01:06.114
# Do not cross the hayfield

01:06.115 --> 01:09.140
# As sinks the blood-red sun

01:12.123 --> 01:15.140
# Ghosts glide from the hayrick

# In the eerie glow

01:27.085 --> 01:32.156
# Do not cross the hayfield... #

01:32.157 --> 01:34.171
Hello, scarecrow.

01:34.172 --> 01:37.109
Oh, I'm sorry. I disturbed you.

01:37.110 --> 01:39.115
No, I couldn't sleep either.
Too excited.

01:41.116 --> 01:42.150
The harvest.

01:42.151 --> 01:45.136
Yes! Of course.

01:45.137 --> 01:47.122
Work the land instead of the mind.

01:47.123 --> 01:49.109
Good medicine.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.143
What for?

01:51.153 --> 01:53.078
Insomnia.

01:55.146 --> 01:57.147
It wasn't your fault Charlie died.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.114
Arrogant.

02:04.125 --> 02:08.110
To think you can determine these people's
fates with your magic psychology.

02:09.109 --> 02:11.131
When, actually, it's you...

02:11.132 --> 02:15.054
managing the harvest, who really
affects our livelihoods and happiness.

02:15.055 --> 02:16.055
Exactly.

02:16.056 --> 02:18.065
You're cleverer than you look.

02:27.096 --> 02:30.086
# Do not cross the hayfield

02:30.087 --> 02:34.048
# The hayfield, the hayfield... #
Come on.

02:34.049 --> 02:36.130
# Do not cross the hayfield

02:36.131 --> 02:40.089
# As sinks the blood-red sun

02:45.041 --> 02:47.110
# Ghosts glide from the hayrick

# Ghosts glide from the hayrick

02:54.063 --> 02:58.041
# In the eerie glow

02:59.048 --> 03:02.064
# The reaper crossed the hayfield

03:02.065 --> 03:05.086
# The hayfield, the hayfield

03:05.087 --> 03:08.092
# Reaper crossed the hayfield

03:08.093 --> 03:11.103
# Sank the blood-red sun... #

03:11.104 --> 03:14.074
WOMAN'S VOICE:
You must make the sacrifice.

03:21.029 --> 03:22.098
SOFT CREAK

03:25.090 --> 03:27.012
Who's there?

03:31.082 --> 03:33.003
Mother?

03:47.084 --> 03:50.021
DOOR CREAKS

04:11.059 --> 04:13.056
WOMAN'S VOICE: Do it.

04:14.066 --> 04:16.007
No.

04:18.003 --> 04:21.048
What's the matter, Peter?
What are you doing in here?

04:21.050 --> 04:22.966
Nothing.

04:23.975 --> 04:25.044
Just go back to sleep.

04:25.216 --> 04:26.256
DOOR SHUTS

04:35.186 --> 04:37.179
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

04:52.210 --> 04:54.370
# This one night

04:55.169 --> 04:58.134
# This one night

04:58.140 --> 05:00.110
# Every night

05:00.114 --> 05:03.083
# And all

05:04.090 --> 05:09.000
# Fire and sleet and candlelight

05:09.008 --> 05:13.070
# And Christ receive thy soul. #

05:57.408 --> 05:58.429
One more day.

05:59.431 --> 06:00.450
So be it.

06:00.451 --> 06:04.373
So go and enjoy your extra leisure
before the hard work begins.

06:04.374 --> 06:05.465
Away you go.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.453
It's tomorrow.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.391
Good.

06:24.413 --> 06:26.378
Toy soldiers you gave him.

06:27.437 --> 06:29.434
You feel you just want to get away,
but often,

06:29.435 --> 06:33.367
after a loss,
it can be very beneficial to stay

06:33.368 --> 06:35.406
and...

06:35.407 --> 06:36.447
Grieve?

06:38.431 --> 06:40.429
Yes.

06:40.430 --> 06:43.377
You're the clever doctor,
aren't you?

06:43.378 --> 06:44.458
Knows what's best for us.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.410
Understands our minds.

06:51.383 --> 06:54.433
I'm sorry I couldn't save him.
So am I.

06:54.434 --> 06:58.393
The cottage will still be here
if you want to come back. We won't.

06:59.405 --> 07:00.454
There's something here.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.358
Took my Charlie.

07:05.392 --> 07:06.416
Took John.

07:09.363 --> 07:10.388
Something bad.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.403
Something wrong.

07:17.429 --> 07:19.382
MAUD: Take care.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.405
SHE SNIFFS
Go on.

07:22.406 --> 07:24.433
HE CLICKS TONGUE
Walk on.

07:27.399 --> 07:29.364
Bye-bye.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.369
Ahhh.

08:15.391 --> 08:17.368
Wash your woes away.

08:18.419 --> 08:20.348
HE EXHALES

08:36.335 --> 08:37.383
SINISTER SCORE

09:04.328 --> 09:05.411
CHARLOTTE: Gideon...
Ma'am.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.422
I want to check the twine supply
for the sheaving. Ma'am.

09:11.359 --> 09:14.337
What's the matter?
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

09:17.377 --> 09:20.419
What's wrong? Hm? Hm?

09:24.332 --> 09:25.334
Peter...

09:25.335 --> 09:27.336
There's a woman
in the old millpond.

09:27.337 --> 09:29.401
Under the water. She's dead?

09:29.402 --> 09:32.327
She must be.

09:33.345 --> 09:34.350
Show me.

09:43.351 --> 09:47.345
I... I can't go in again.
No. Just direct me.

09:49.318 --> 09:50.402
She's there, in the middle.

10:30.347 --> 10:33.325
You didn't see her? No.

10:35.354 --> 10:39.365
I must have imagined it. Yes.
Yes, you must have.

10:39.366 --> 10:42.308
WOMAN'S VOICE: He can't help you.
Shut up!

10:44.337 --> 10:45.377
I beg your pardon?

10:47.332 --> 10:49.325
I-I-I beg yours, sir.

10:50.367 --> 10:53.325
Do you often blurt things out
like that?

10:53.326 --> 10:55.375
Insults or profanities? No?

10:57.318 --> 11:00.331
Do you suffer involuntary spasms
or hear voices?

11:03.384 --> 11:06.394
You... You helped
the reverend's daughter when...

11:06.395 --> 11:09.346
Yes. ..she was disturbed.
Yes, I did.

11:09.347 --> 11:12.345
Well, I could arrange for you
to see a doctor in Bristol.

11:13.357 --> 11:17.364
There's... There's no need for a doctor. I'm...
I'm sorry if I mis...misled you.

11:17.365 --> 11:19.335
No, it's, um...

11:19.336 --> 11:22.310
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE

11:45.355 --> 11:47.344
ETHEREAL RAGGED BREATH

12:00.287 --> 12:02.296
CHARLOTTE: Gwen...
Just a moment.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.334
Have they just got the harvest in?

12:09.335 --> 12:10.374
That's it.

12:13.291 --> 12:16.338
It's a salt-and-silver print.
How old is it?

12:16.339 --> 12:17.368
1861.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.339
Where did you find it?
I thought you just put it up.

12:21.340 --> 12:24.296
Oh. I did. Shall I take it down?

12:24.297 --> 12:27.308
Oh, don't be silly. I love it.

12:27.309 --> 12:30.299
I should do one this year.
Yes, you must.

12:31.331 --> 12:33.317
Where are your parents?

12:33.318 --> 12:34.362
There. Ah!

12:34.363 --> 12:37.337
And you're a glint in their eye.
Can I...?

12:37.338 --> 12:39.371
Yes. Sorry, Gwen. Thank you.

12:41.277 --> 12:42.318
HE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

12:42.319 --> 12:44.347
Everyone's a bit... Mm.

12:44.348 --> 12:48.339
When the reaping's imminent,
the tension in the air.

12:49.371 --> 12:52.310
I almost wish it were over.

12:52.311 --> 12:54.285
It will be.

12:54.286 --> 12:55.357
But now... Oh!

12:55.358 --> 12:58.285
..I'm going to distract you.

12:58.286 --> 12:59.310
Go get your camera.

13:05.364 --> 13:07.309
One of my childhood haunts.

13:08.339 --> 13:10.368
There'll be some good pictures
inside.

13:12.302 --> 13:14.283
It's beautiful.

13:17.313 --> 13:18.348
What's that?

13:18.349 --> 13:20.338
What's happened to the fish?

13:21.351 --> 13:23.345
I don't know.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.288
Did you see someone?

13:32.289 --> 13:33.344
No.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.346
So come on. Show me inside.

13:37.296 --> 13:38.313
Hm.

13:50.309 --> 13:51.350
Ohh!

13:53.356 --> 13:56.322
The millstone. Mm.

13:57.335 --> 14:00.302
As a boy, I saw it as an altar,

14:00.303 --> 14:02.340
where a high priest
might make a sacrifice.

14:03.350 --> 14:07.276
You were an interesting child.
Thank you.

14:07.277 --> 14:09.354
Right, come on. Let me show you
upstairs. You'll like it.

14:09.355 --> 14:12.346
You sound like a hotelier. Stayed in
a lot of hotels, have you?

14:12.347 --> 14:16.275
In my younger, wilder days.
I don't want to know.

14:22.289 --> 14:24.270
WINGS FLUTTER

14:26.297 --> 14:28.298
What was that?

14:34.250 --> 14:37.320
There's nothing here.
It was probably a bat or something.

14:38.326 --> 14:42.252
You're right. I like it.

14:43.261 --> 14:45.323
So, why is it derelict?

14:45.324 --> 14:49.277
Well, the old miller died,
and they tried to keep it going,

14:49.278 --> 14:52.333
but abandoned it
after the bad harvest of '62.

14:52.334 --> 14:55.341
And then the steam mill opening...
Hm!

14:55.342 --> 14:58.296
Progress. Mm.

15:23.275 --> 15:28.254
50 seconds. I like being
on this side of the camera.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.270
I can move.

15:46.314 --> 15:48.307
SINISTER SCORE BUILDS

15:58.283 --> 16:02.319
If it was me, I would have started the
reaping already. She knows what she's doing.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.310
Filling our coffers today.
Yeah, but not next week.

16:05.311 --> 16:07.322
Not next month,
if this harvest ain't a good 'un.

16:07.323 --> 16:11.315
Hark at the young.
More full of woe than us old ones.

16:11.316 --> 16:15.226
If I told you last harvest that
you'd be listening to a young woman

16:15.227 --> 16:16.320
learned her farming from a book...

16:16.321 --> 16:20.287
See, you don't see no ill
because she done dazzled you, Uncle.

16:20.288 --> 16:23.283
I think Gideon's adapting
remarkably well, Jack.

16:23.284 --> 16:26.267
And his vision is clear.

16:26.268 --> 16:29.243
We must evolve and embrace the new.

16:29.244 --> 16:32.237
You'll take a cup, Mr Denning?
Oh, thank you, Simon.

16:34.303 --> 16:36.221
And the old.

16:36.222 --> 16:38.248
The old and the new.

16:38.249 --> 16:40.236
MEN: The old and the new.

16:40.237 --> 16:42.283
Ah!

16:45.307 --> 16:47.303
Ah, Mrs Hare.

16:47.304 --> 16:49.226
Mr Appleby.

16:49.227 --> 16:50.275
May I speak with Peter?

16:51.294 --> 16:53.281
Yes.

16:53.282 --> 16:57.301
Well, he's not here this moment,
but I expect him presently.

16:59.277 --> 17:03.306
Mm. Please, come in.

17:03.307 --> 17:05.256
Take some tea.

17:08.266 --> 17:11.221
He's a good boy. Clever.

17:11.222 --> 17:13.287
Schoolmaster said
he could have gone to university...

17:13.288 --> 17:15.267
on a scholarship.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.214
Really? Why didn't he?

17:20.231 --> 17:21.296
It's better to learn a trade.

17:23.247 --> 17:24.276
And stay here.

17:26.226 --> 17:29.244
Safe and sound.
Just the two of you, isn't it?

17:29.245 --> 17:33.267
His father died when he was small?
Hence no more children.

17:33.268 --> 17:36.210
And how is Peter?
What are you doing here?

17:37.228 --> 17:38.250
Peter!

17:38.251 --> 17:40.253
Manners, please.

17:40.254 --> 17:42.214
Discussing me?

17:42.215 --> 17:43.259
What you been telling him?

17:45.265 --> 17:46.282
Nothing.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.301
Peter!

17:55.219 --> 17:57.293
You concocting a plan?
To put me in a Bristol asylum?

17:57.294 --> 18:00.249
No. I've come to ask you
if you poisoned the millpond.

18:01.266 --> 18:03.207
All the fish are dead.

18:04.285 --> 18:07.203
I... I didn't do anything.

18:08.224 --> 18:12.279
But you've come to accuse me and...
And talk about me and discuss my...

18:16.198 --> 18:18.225
Are you sure you saw them?

18:18.226 --> 18:20.231
Maybe your mind's playing tricks
on you, too.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.251
Maybe you're hallucinating.
No, I'm not.

18:24.205 --> 18:26.223
Because my wife saw them, too.

18:26.224 --> 18:28.249
There's nothing wrong with my mind.

18:30.212 --> 18:31.244
If you say so.

18:33.210 --> 18:34.235
You're the expert.

18:41.236 --> 18:43.209
I'm sorry I can't help you.

18:44.228 --> 18:46.289
But I'm glad it's only dead fish
you've seen.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.208
And not dead people.

19:22.247 --> 19:23.262
SHE GASPS

19:23.263 --> 19:25.182
SHE SIGHS

19:25.183 --> 19:28.237
You want a lock on this,
stop people bursting in.

19:28.238 --> 19:30.208
Look at this. It's strange.

19:30.209 --> 19:33.247
It...looks a little
like a woman standing there.

19:36.255 --> 19:39.261
Hm. A little.

19:40.259 --> 19:43.185
Must be imperfections
in the silver bromide.

19:44.186 --> 19:47.192
So? Did he admit
to poisoning the fish?

19:47.193 --> 19:49.204
No. I believed him.

19:49.205 --> 19:52.215
Could be natural causes... Disease.

19:52.216 --> 19:55.222
But he's clearly somewhat disturbed.

19:55.223 --> 19:58.174
What? I'm not treating him.
I'm not stopping you. I know.

19:58.175 --> 20:00.208
If you feel the need...
He's not my responsibility.

20:00.209 --> 20:04.200
Unlike the harvest. So...let's eat and get
to bed early, because tomorrow, it begins.

20:19.181 --> 20:20.226
WOMAN'S VOICE: Come out...

20:28.256 --> 20:30.201
..into the wheat.

20:49.258 --> 20:52.237
You must make the sacrifice.

20:52.238 --> 20:56.168
Your mother's blood. No.

20:56.169 --> 20:58.166
Or the harvest will perish.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.243
You're up with the lark.

21:58.244 --> 22:02.144
Hard to sleep before harvest.

22:02.145 --> 22:04.207
What you been doing? Nothing.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.216
Nathan?

22:15.238 --> 22:18.184
BOTH: Didn't mean to disturb you.

22:20.217 --> 22:22.238
It's beginning to get light.

22:37.197 --> 22:41.168
You beat me, Gideon!
I wanted to be first here.

22:41.169 --> 22:43.146
The crop has been cursed.

22:44.212 --> 22:47.142
What are they?
Happened before, in '62.

22:47.143 --> 22:49.177
Black devils -
destroyed the whole harvest.

22:50.174 --> 22:52.152
What about the other fields?

22:52.153 --> 22:55.152
All of them. They're everywhere.

22:55.153 --> 22:56.206
How do you get rid of them?

22:56.207 --> 22:58.138
You can't.

23:07.142 --> 23:09.220
Now I know what you were doing
out here. Cursing the harvest.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.219
No. No, I wasn't.

23:28.173 --> 23:29.218
We have an infestation.

23:31.137 --> 23:35.134
These acts of nature
do happen from time to time.

23:35.135 --> 23:39.126
They're only insects. They're
not devils. This is not a curse.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.181
It's a problem.

23:42.182 --> 23:43.217
Let's solve it.

23:43.218 --> 23:45.143
May I borrow your bag?

23:48.128 --> 23:49.204
We will pick these beetles off
one by one.

23:49.205 --> 23:53.147
We will harvest them
and then we will cut our wheat.

24:00.205 --> 24:04.124
I know it won't work,
but it's better than doing nothing.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.161
I'm going to look at my books.

24:23.184 --> 24:26.158
I lied when I said
I don't hear voices. I do.

24:26.159 --> 24:28.138
It's her under the water.

24:28.139 --> 24:30.204
And in the field at night
last night, she said to me...

24:30.205 --> 24:32.162
the harvest'll perish...

24:32.163 --> 24:34.149
unless I sacrifice my mother.

24:34.150 --> 24:37.112
No, Peter, you don't have to do
that. That's a delusion.

24:37.113 --> 24:39.138
I heard her. I saw her.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.190
But you don't have to believe her.
Peter...

25:23.106 --> 25:24.139
Not here.

25:29.109 --> 25:30.194
SHE SIGHS

25:41.110 --> 25:42.135
Mrs Hare...

25:43.161 --> 25:46.108
Remember this happening in '62?

25:46.109 --> 25:48.154
No. I was too young.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.172
Well, perhaps best forgotten.

25:51.173 --> 25:54.181
Must have been very distressing
for everyone. Even a child.

25:54.182 --> 25:56.120
Especially a child.

26:02.113 --> 26:03.178
Peter seems agitated today.

26:03.179 --> 26:06.111
His nerves are highly strung,
that's all.

26:06.112 --> 26:08.127
And these...

26:08.128 --> 26:10.143
horrible things...

26:10.144 --> 26:12.134
Enough to drive anyone mad.

26:12.135 --> 26:14.157
He is fine.

26:14.158 --> 26:17.148
And I can take care of him.

26:19.125 --> 26:23.084
So, please, no more talk of asylums.

26:23.085 --> 26:26.138
He...
He doesn't deserve to be punished.

26:26.139 --> 26:27.168
Punished?

26:28.179 --> 26:31.089
No, I'm just concerned.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.156
For both of you. And if Peter
were to become aggressive...

26:33.157 --> 26:35.093
He won't.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.166
Excuse me, Mr Appleby.

26:38.173 --> 26:42.147
I feel a little unwell.
I should go home and lie down.

26:42.148 --> 26:44.129
Can you lock your bedroom door?

27:16.071 --> 27:17.088
Gwen!

27:18.168 --> 27:21.141
Gather all the sugar we have.
All the sugar?

27:21.142 --> 27:25.084
We heat it until it caramelises. Keep stirring.
I'll put another pan on.

27:25.085 --> 27:28.072
It's beginning to melt.
Good. Bit longer. Nathan...

27:28.073 --> 27:30.154
I need some twine and lamp oil.
All right. What are you making?

27:30.155 --> 27:33.079
Magic. Science.

27:39.122 --> 27:43.149
Thank you for your endeavour,
everyone. You can stop now.

27:43.150 --> 27:45.083
We have a new method.

27:46.113 --> 27:49.110
Now, watch me plant this,
so you can do the same.

27:50.112 --> 27:52.109
Beware of the crop catching fire.

28:03.085 --> 28:04.157
Say a prayer.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.101
It's working.

28:46.079 --> 28:48.100
Right, then, let's plant the others.

28:51.086 --> 28:54.051
Right, everyone. One each.

28:55.136 --> 28:57.073
Spread out.

29:45.129 --> 29:48.055
It's like the end of the world.

29:50.067 --> 29:51.108
Or the beginning.

30:03.033 --> 30:04.050
JACK: Peter Hare.

30:05.092 --> 30:08.042
Jack. Uncle saw you out here.

30:08.043 --> 30:10.046
Hatching mischief.

30:10.047 --> 30:11.116
No, I was... I was just...

30:12.119 --> 30:14.041
..taking the air.

30:14.042 --> 30:15.090
You what?

30:16.094 --> 30:18.076
Taking the air?

30:18.077 --> 30:21.046
God, you've always been an odd one,
Peter Hare.

30:21.047 --> 30:24.126
I remember him in the schoolroom.
Sharp as a knife, he was.

30:26.031 --> 30:29.101
I remember you saying that you hated
this village and every soul in it.

30:29.102 --> 30:31.029
Damned us all to hell.

30:31.030 --> 30:34.033
It was only
cos you made me eat worms.

30:34.034 --> 30:36.051
They still growing inside you?!

30:38.024 --> 30:39.073
What's done is done.

30:41.064 --> 30:43.072
I don't know what you've been
dabbling in,

30:43.073 --> 30:45.092
but the new mistress
has broke the spell now.

30:45.093 --> 30:48.048
So let's have no more. Right?

30:59.020 --> 31:00.048
You hot?

31:01.083 --> 31:03.032
You look hot.

31:11.017 --> 31:13.034
Like a drowned rat.

31:14.072 --> 31:17.026
Leave it, Jack.
Best get back to work.

31:30.105 --> 31:33.054
Thank you, everyone.
It's been a long day.

31:33.055 --> 31:36.017
Have a good rest tonight
and we'll carry on tomorrow.

31:36.018 --> 31:38.048
Well done. Very good work.

31:39.062 --> 31:40.067
Peter...

31:42.066 --> 31:44.056
How are you?

31:44.057 --> 31:46.026
Better, thank you.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.055
I'm sorry I was so excitable.

31:49.056 --> 31:53.030
No, no. They were disturbing -
the insects.

31:54.039 --> 31:55.076
Crawling into our minds.

31:57.086 --> 31:59.071
Well, disaster averted...

32:00.074 --> 32:02.011
..without a sacrifice.

32:04.008 --> 32:05.101
Maybe she's gone now.

32:07.100 --> 32:11.017
Are you going to the Wheatsheaf
with the others?

32:11.018 --> 32:12.038
No?

32:12.039 --> 32:14.029
Walk with me to the house.

32:14.030 --> 32:16.023
Come on.

32:22.060 --> 32:24.065
I want to show you something.

32:26.003 --> 32:28.057
That's your mother as a child.

32:28.058 --> 32:30.036
Thank you, Gwen.

32:33.069 --> 32:36.027
I was always looking
at that picture when I was younger.

32:36.028 --> 32:39.022
Asking my mother who everyone was.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.028
Who's that woman?

32:47.002 --> 32:50.000
Yes, she had an odd name.
What was it? Um... Clarity Winlove.

32:50.001 --> 32:51.032
Clarity.

32:51.033 --> 32:54.046
They say she was a healer and helped
women who wanted to conceive.

32:54.047 --> 32:56.085
Yes, I remember my mother
talking about her now.

32:56.086 --> 32:59.073
Absolutely adamant that those
potions really worked, while I,

32:59.074 --> 33:02.065
a pedantic student, insisted
it could only be a placebo effect.

33:02.066 --> 33:04.001
What happened to her?

33:04.002 --> 33:08.029
She left the parish that year of
the plagued harvest, so I'm told.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.043
Thank you for your hosp...

33:13.044 --> 33:15.015
hospitality.

33:15.016 --> 33:16.052
I should go.

33:23.074 --> 33:25.027
Are you worried about him?

33:26.029 --> 33:28.015
Oh...yes and no.

33:29.024 --> 33:31.037
You can never be sure
what someone is capable of.

33:34.007 --> 33:37.049
Are you worried about me?
Yes and no.

33:38.066 --> 33:41.016
I wonder...

33:41.017 --> 33:45.064
when you're helping people...looking
for what's wrong with them...

33:48.076 --> 33:50.074
What?

33:50.075 --> 33:52.068
..what else you're looking for.

33:52.069 --> 33:55.021
Aren't your hands full enough
with the harvest?

33:55.022 --> 33:56.050
With me?

34:05.048 --> 34:07.001
They are now.

34:18.053 --> 34:20.002
BABY CRIES

34:26.971 --> 34:29.996
BABY CRIES

34:36.016 --> 34:38.038
BABY CRIES

34:41.024 --> 34:43.021
BABY CRIES

34:47.978 --> 34:49.005
Who's there?

34:51.029 --> 34:53.022
CRYING CONTINUES

34:54.980 --> 34:59.026
CHILD'S VOICE:
Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop.

34:59.027 --> 35:01.061
When the wind blows, the cradle...

35:01.062 --> 35:02.984
Gabriel.

35:20.998 --> 35:22.975
What's wrong with me?

35:40.049 --> 35:43.015
CLARITY'S VOICE:
You will reap what has been sown.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.955
THUNDERCLAP
Nathan?

35:47.027 --> 35:49.001
Is that rain?

35:53.983 --> 35:55.027
The harvest, Nathan.

36:02.948 --> 36:03.969
What?

36:05.035 --> 36:06.956
What woke you?

36:07.995 --> 36:09.012
The storm.

36:16.013 --> 36:17.023
Nathan...

36:17.024 --> 36:19.004
Let's go.

36:19.005 --> 36:20.029
Move on.

36:22.983 --> 36:24.956
THUNDER RUMBLES

36:26.950 --> 36:27.983
They're here.

36:33.997 --> 36:36.982
Bad storm. Didn't see it coming.

36:39.012 --> 36:41.965
Load up the wagon.
We'll get it to the barn.

36:41.966 --> 36:43.968
FARM WORKERS SHOUT

36:56.988 --> 36:58.977
Keep going.

37:16.963 --> 37:18.027
John...

37:32.967 --> 37:35.021
Gideon! Yes, sir.

37:35.022 --> 37:36.960
Help me.

37:48.959 --> 37:51.993
We'll unload and come back.
We'll gather more together.

37:55.930 --> 37:57.011
The devil wants to drown us all.

37:58.973 --> 38:00.967
Hyah!

38:00.968 --> 38:02.959
HE SHIVERS

38:02.960 --> 38:06.939
CLARITY'S VOICE: They will blame you
for the rain unless you stop it.

38:08.010 --> 38:09.960
So stop it.

38:10.990 --> 38:15.005
Make the sacrifice now,
while she's sound asleep.

38:21.952 --> 38:23.949
GENTLE BANGING

38:24.959 --> 38:27.980
Why have you locked it?
I just want to talk to you.

38:30.977 --> 38:33.983
In the morning.
I need to ask you about someone...

38:35.976 --> 38:37.925
..who you knew as a child.

38:41.963 --> 38:42.983
Clarity Winlove.

38:49.917 --> 38:50.945
Mother, please.

38:54.952 --> 38:57.966
I don't...
I don't know who you mean.

38:57.967 --> 38:59.933
You liar!

39:04.002 --> 39:06.908
SOBBING

39:08.932 --> 39:11.930
You... You may not love me...

39:13.983 --> 39:15.968
..and that may be my curse.

39:18.986 --> 39:20.999
But I love you, Peter.

39:24.901 --> 39:25.917
You liar.

39:32.995 --> 39:35.956
SHE GASPS SOFTLY

39:42.913 --> 39:46.943
Go home and get some rest,
and pray for better weather.

39:46.944 --> 39:48.933
That's all we can do. Sir.

39:51.978 --> 39:55.944
He's conjured it.
You shouldn't have doused him.

40:00.968 --> 40:02.910
I flushed him out. Now we know.

40:03.931 --> 40:05.918
And them creatures...

40:05.919 --> 40:07.918
Now this.

40:07.919 --> 40:09.988
The mistress be no match for him.

40:09.989 --> 40:13.920
Now, happen
we have to end it ourself.

40:13.921 --> 40:14.954
The old way.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.966
I don't know.

40:20.887 --> 40:22.897
Leave it with me.

40:25.910 --> 40:26.923
HE SIGHS SOFTLY

40:28.965 --> 40:31.922
I should have started reaping
three days ago.

40:31.923 --> 40:33.978
You couldn't have known.
I'm too green.

40:33.979 --> 40:36.887
No-one could have known, Charlotte.

40:36.888 --> 40:37.943
It's just...

40:37.944 --> 40:39.946
bad luck.

40:39.947 --> 40:42.981
Bad luck?
There's been a lot of that lately.

40:44.934 --> 40:47.960
Losing John, losing Charlie...

40:49.925 --> 40:52.979
We haven't lost the harvest.
We've saved almost a third.

40:52.980 --> 40:56.886
A quarter.
The rest is out there, drowning.

40:58.926 --> 41:01.924
Perhaps you've brought
the curse with you, Nathan.

41:02.966 --> 41:04.911
What do you mean?

41:06.933 --> 41:08.906
Maybe it's me.

41:09.944 --> 41:11.893
Well, I wasn't born here.

41:12.972 --> 41:14.958
I don't belong here. I...

41:14.959 --> 41:18.961
I brought in that machine.
I judged the reaping wrong.

41:20.970 --> 41:23.907
See? I'm the problem.

41:25.969 --> 41:27.902
I'm the curse.

41:28.963 --> 41:30.929
That's lunatic talk.

41:33.954 --> 41:35.884
Monomaniacal.

41:38.881 --> 41:40.896
Are you some kind of expert?

41:40.897 --> 41:42.947
I dabble.

41:42.948 --> 41:46.946
These misfortunes have
absolutely nothing to do with you.

41:46.947 --> 41:48.920
There is no curse.

41:51.930 --> 41:53.883
You're quite convincing.

41:54.905 --> 41:56.902
Thank you.

41:57.921 --> 42:00.907
Now go and get dry
before you catch your death.

42:56.859 --> 42:57.900
KNOCK ON DOOR

42:59.850 --> 43:01.871
Peter's not here.
It's you I've come to see.

43:09.936 --> 43:11.929
Do you remember Clarity Winlove?

43:15.871 --> 43:16.893
No.

43:16.894 --> 43:19.880
No, I don't. But you know the name?

43:22.881 --> 43:23.936
Yes.

43:23.937 --> 43:25.859
That's right.

43:25.860 --> 43:28.918
She left the village
and she went to America.

43:28.919 --> 43:30.905
She had a distant cousin.

43:32.846 --> 43:35.863
That's the story?
Well, that's what happened.

43:35.864 --> 43:37.899
That's what my parents told me.

43:37.900 --> 43:39.860
God rest their souls.

43:39.861 --> 43:41.878
I'm sorry it's distressing.
It's not.

43:41.879 --> 43:43.893
It's... It's nothing to do with me.

43:43.894 --> 43:46.917
No, I'm not accusing you.
Everybody's accusing me.

43:46.918 --> 43:50.930
It's like Jack Langtree just now,
when I told him Peter's not here.

43:50.931 --> 43:54.860
"You sure?" he says, like I'm lying,

43:54.861 --> 43:55.930
like he thinks I'm hiding him.

43:55.931 --> 43:58.836
Why would he think that?
I don't know.

43:58.837 --> 43:59.925
It's the bad harvest.

43:59.926 --> 44:02.926
Everyone's on edge.
What did he want?

44:04.891 --> 44:05.920
A wheel fixing.

44:11.902 --> 44:12.918
A scapegoat.

44:14.908 --> 44:18.867
# The sun went down
and the moon rose

44:18.868 --> 44:21.886
# On the hayfield, the hayfield

44:21.887 --> 44:24.913
# Sun went down and the moon rose

44:24.914 --> 44:27.908
# On the bleak hayfield... #

44:27.909 --> 44:30.840
Peter!

44:30.841 --> 44:33.831
# The reaper crossed the hayfield

44:33.832 --> 44:36.843
# The hayfield, the hayfield

44:36.844 --> 44:40.826
# Reaper crossed the hayfield

44:40.827 --> 44:43.917
# Sank the blood-red sun

44:46.830 --> 44:49.863
# Do not cross the hayfield

44:49.864 --> 44:53.919
# The hayfield, the hayfield

44:56.831 --> 45:00.913
# Do not cross the hayfield... #

45:00.914 --> 45:03.828
Caught like a hare in the gin.

45:04.845 --> 45:06.842
I remember you hiding here before.

45:08.844 --> 45:09.877
Don't scare me.

45:13.835 --> 45:15.869
So is this where you do it?

45:15.870 --> 45:17.843
Sacrificing?

45:18.854 --> 45:20.836
Casting spells?

45:20.837 --> 45:22.826
Summon up those black beetles?

45:23.853 --> 45:24.886
And bring on that rain?

45:24.887 --> 45:26.898
No... No.

45:27.903 --> 45:29.861
You cursed the harvest, Peter Hare.

45:44.888 --> 45:46.822
It's not his fault.

45:46.823 --> 45:47.859
It's mine.

45:48.863 --> 45:49.906
It's mine.

45:49.907 --> 45:51.868
Come with me.

45:52.865 --> 45:54.867
Now, if you float, you're a witch.

45:54.868 --> 45:56.907
And if you sink, you're innocent.
No!

45:56.908 --> 45:59.811
Please, no!

46:03.823 --> 46:04.832
PETER GROANS

CLARITY'S VOICE:
This is what was done to me.

46:22.863 --> 46:24.880
You'll reap what you sowed.

46:29.893 --> 46:32.864
You're floating, see?

46:32.865 --> 46:33.897
Proof.

46:38.847 --> 46:39.892
You are a witch.

46:48.864 --> 46:50.813
What have you done, Jack?

47:01.837 --> 47:03.826
Oh, Peter.

47:14.839 --> 47:16.861
Oh, Peter.

47:16.862 --> 47:18.875
Peter. Turn him on his side.

47:26.808 --> 47:27.871
(Leave him.)

47:27.872 --> 47:29.842
Come on. (Take me.)

47:29.843 --> 47:32.786
PETER COUGHS
Oh, thank God. That's it.

47:32.787 --> 47:33.879
What I owe her.

47:38.824 --> 47:39.873
It's what I owe her.

47:45.812 --> 47:47.786
Maud...

47:47.787 --> 47:49.788
Maud... It's what I owe her.

47:50.834 --> 47:52.841
For what I did.

47:52.842 --> 47:53.878
What did you do?

47:56.800 --> 47:58.817
It was a terrible time.

48:00.808 --> 48:02.870
The harvest was ruined.

48:02.871 --> 48:05.853
The village seemed damned.

48:07.814 --> 48:09.861
And Clarity frightened me.

48:09.862 --> 48:11.835
The way she looked at me.

48:16.804 --> 48:18.786
And one day,

48:18.787 --> 48:19.822
I saw her...

48:19.823 --> 48:22.802
give a potion to my mother

48:22.803 --> 48:27.808
to put in my father's food.
To help them to conceive.

48:27.809 --> 48:29.804
I can see that now.

48:29.805 --> 48:31.819
But as a child,

48:31.820 --> 48:33.822
as an only child,

48:33.823 --> 48:35.843
I told myself she was a witch.

48:35.844 --> 48:38.837
An evil witch. And I...

48:38.838 --> 48:40.786
I lied.

48:40.787 --> 48:42.801
I told my parents

48:42.802 --> 48:43.865
I'd seen her...

48:43.866 --> 48:45.835
curse the wheatfield.

48:47.841 --> 48:49.803
And they brought her here.

48:49.804 --> 48:51.854
And they ducked her.

48:51.855 --> 48:53.847
And they drowned her.

48:53.848 --> 48:55.849
And they sank her down with chains.

49:01.793 --> 49:05.800
I've been so full of guilt
and I fed you on fear.

49:06.804 --> 49:08.802
Forgive me. Maud...

49:10.807 --> 49:12.772
Of... Of course I do.

49:14.802 --> 49:16.799
Of course I forgive you.

49:18.786 --> 49:20.768
You're my mother.

49:20.769 --> 49:23.791
MAUD SOBS
You must forgive yourself.

49:24.840 --> 49:26.789
You must.

49:27.811 --> 49:28.856
You were just a child.

49:30.763 --> 49:31.799
Time to let her go.

49:36.837 --> 49:38.779
Let's get you home.

49:43.792 --> 49:46.805
Nathan? Go with them.

50:00.804 --> 50:02.809
Clarity Winlove...

50:06.750 --> 50:07.795
..show yourself.

50:11.788 --> 50:13.754
You sat...

50:14.788 --> 50:16.779
..by my wife...

50:16.780 --> 50:17.820
as she slept.

50:18.844 --> 50:20.797
You touched her womb.

50:25.826 --> 50:27.843
Was it a blessing or was it a curse?

50:39.838 --> 50:41.780
HE SIGHS

50:53.763 --> 50:54.819
Is Jack Langtree here?

51:02.765 --> 51:04.750
Celebrating killing the man?

51:07.800 --> 51:10.786
He died? No, you're lucky he didn't.

51:10.787 --> 51:12.800
Or I would have you hanged
for murder.

51:15.810 --> 51:18.792
Well, there's something wrong here
of late, you cannot deny.

51:20.821 --> 51:22.782
Looked to me like he be the cause.

51:24.816 --> 51:26.793
I was just trying to rid us of evil.

51:26.794 --> 51:28.813
Oh, you want to rid us of evil,
do you?

51:31.826 --> 51:34.728
Go.

51:34.729 --> 51:35.784
Now.

51:35.785 --> 51:37.738
Never return to my land.

51:38.821 --> 51:41.755
You are banished, Jack.

52:06.722 --> 52:07.802
I was going anyway.

52:14.744 --> 52:15.788
This place is damned.

52:17.723 --> 52:18.796
You can't deny you've all felt it.

52:25.769 --> 52:27.734

53:14.722 --> 53:16.715
Thank you.

I do bear guilt for my suspicions

and for not quashing his.
