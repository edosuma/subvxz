(theme music playing)

01:08.800 --> 01:11.600
(video game music plays)

01:16.320 --> 01:19.280
(Danielle) <i>My whole life is waiting</i>
<i>for something to happen.</i>

01:19.360 --> 01:22.320
-Patty!
-Oh, no way!

01:22.400 --> 01:24.880
Come on.
This is a killer dress.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.960
This could very well be
what gave Andy his heart attack.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.400
(Danielle) <i>It's so easy to listen in</i>
<i>on grownups' conversations.</i>

01:31.480 --> 01:33.280
<i>You just act like you're</i>
<i>playing some boring game.</i>

01:33.360 --> 01:36.120
-It's so backless.
-Exactly.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.240
Patty, men love backs, okay?

01:41.320 --> 01:45.240
This will drive Graham insane.
You will have an incredible weekend.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.960
No. No. I just,
I don't think it's... me.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.240
(clicks tongue)

01:54.000 --> 01:57.160
-I wonder why Graham isn't back here yet.
-Where is he?

01:57.240 --> 02:01.480
He's at another meeting with another
potential restaurant investor.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.360
Oh, he's with that
Hallie Lowenthal person?

02:03.440 --> 02:05.640
Yes, and shut up.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.080
I didn't say anything.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.520
I'm not upset
because he's with Hallie Lowenthal.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.720
I'm upset because Neil and Marla
will be here any minute,

02:12.800 --> 02:14.440
and he hasn't come home.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.560
-And I'm not upset.
-Okay.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.880
I can't believe Marla
is still dating Neil.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.160
-How many years is it?
-Six.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.200
I know.
It's like a prison sentence.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.280
How about this?

02:26.360 --> 02:27.880
-I got it from that catalogue.
-(laughs)

02:27.960 --> 02:32.040
(Danielle) <i>It's truly amazing.</i>
<i>I have the power to be invisible.</i>

02:32.640 --> 02:35.320
Honey, why don't you get yourself
a piece of fruit?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.880
'Cause Angela's in the kitchen
with Rickie. She kicked me out.

02:39.480 --> 02:43.120
You get a piece of fruit.
I'll be down to talk to Angela.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.200
-Oh, I don't know. (sighs)
-Oh, come on!

02:51.560 --> 02:55.280
(Danielle) <i>My life is different</i>
<i>people kicking me out of different rooms.</i>

02:55.360 --> 02:56.800
It's just been so long

02:56.880 --> 03:00.000
since Graham and I
have had any time alone together.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.240
I know we won't
technically be alone,

03:02.320 --> 03:05.600
but we're pretty comfortable
with Neil and Marla.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.640
Well, Marla.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.560
And I feel like our marriage
needs this, you know?

03:10.640 --> 03:15.160
We need this time to reconnect
or something.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.040
Patty...

03:17.360 --> 03:19.800
I know exactly what you need.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.680
(dramatic music playing)

03:24.560 --> 03:26.120
Oh, my God!

03:26.200 --> 03:28.120
(both laughs)

03:28.200 --> 03:30.800
Oh, my!

03:31.400 --> 03:34.600
-You actually own these?
-No, I rent them.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.080
Well, you said you needed
to reconnect.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.120
Ha!
(laughs)

03:42.200 --> 03:44.240
-Yay or nay?
-Yay.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.880
-Oh, in such a big way.
-(both laughs)

03:46.960 --> 03:48.240
(door closes)

03:48.320 --> 03:50.040
Danielle, why don't you
go help mom pack?

03:50.560 --> 03:53.640
(telephone rings)

03:53.720 --> 03:54.600
Hello.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.560
Yeah, he's here.
Just a second.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.480
It's Rayanne.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.000
(video game music plays)

04:02.080 --> 04:05.200
-Hey.
<i>-Hey, it's the raygun. What's shakin'?</i>

04:05.280 --> 04:08.280
<i>-Uh...nada.</i>
-So Angela, like, barely said hello.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.760
Don't put me
in the middle of this.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.480
I didn't put you there.
That's where you are.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.920
Yeah, I'll try them.
I will. I'll try them.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.440
-Sure you don't want to stay at my house?
-Oh, yeah.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.920
-Bye. I'll see ya'.
-Bye.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.920
-Have fun.
-(laughs)

04:26.000 --> 04:27.240
(door opens)

04:27.840 --> 04:28.920
-What?
-(door closes)

04:29.000 --> 04:30.960
Did you kick your sister
out of the kitchen?

04:32.320 --> 04:33.640
No.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.520
Mom,
she was being impossible.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.560
Angela... (scoffs)

04:39.640 --> 04:43.680
this is a really big responsibility
being here alone all weekend.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.040
Mom, I've been alone
with Danielle before.

04:46.120 --> 04:50.600
-I recall you put her in the dryer.
-That was so long ago.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.080
I can't believe you're still
talking about that.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.720
Anyway,
she begged me to do it.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.480
Whosever idea it was,

04:58.560 --> 05:01.640
I don't want to come home
and find anyone in an appliance.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.080
You have to be the adult
this weekend.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.240
You'll have to prove to me
you can handle this.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.800
It'll just be me and Rickie.
What could possibly happen?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.680
(chuckles)

05:13.760 --> 05:14.880
(kisses)

05:17.160 --> 05:19.320
Enrique,
what do you want for dinner?

05:19.400 --> 05:20.880
Hold on a second.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.800
Uh, look...
I better not tie up their line.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.680
-You know?
-You're not allowed to talk to me now?

05:31.280 --> 05:34.600
Just, um... try me
at Katimski's later, okay?

05:34.680 --> 05:38.320
-Yeah, right. Later... much.
-(hung up)

05:38.400 --> 05:40.440
(dramatic music playing)

05:41.160 --> 05:42.120
(nervously chuckles)

05:48.840 --> 05:52.200
-(Danielle) Hi, daddy. You're late.
-(Graham) I know.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.280
Hi, hi.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.880
-Oh, my God. Your new shirt.
-I'll be ready in five minutes.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.760
You will not believe
what happened.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.600
(sighs)
Car trouble.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.320
Oh, no.
The wagon?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.760
No, actually it was
Hallie Lowenthal's car.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.040
Oh.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.320
I know. It's infuriating.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.760
She's got this really loud,
obnoxious car.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.600
Of course,
it won't start in the cold,

06:18.680 --> 06:20.760
and so I look under the hood.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.520
You looked under
Hallie Lowenthal's hood?

06:23.600 --> 06:25.120
I couldn't just
leave her there.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.000
You would not believe
Hallie Lowenthal's engine.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.840
It's held together by string.
Literally.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.760
Couldn't she call Brad
if her car broke down?

06:33.840 --> 06:35.720
Isn't that what fiancÃ©s
are for?

06:35.800 --> 06:37.640
Right. Well, they broke up.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.040
Didn't I tell you?

06:42.080 --> 06:43.200
No.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.400
Are you sure?
I thought I did.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.440
No.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.040
(doorbell rings)

06:49.120 --> 06:50.240
That must be them.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.240
(exhales)

06:58.280 --> 06:59.880
(door opens)

06:59.960 --> 07:00.920
Hi!
Hey.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.880
-You're not Marla.
-Danielle. (laughs)

07:07.160 --> 07:10.160
-Hi!
-Hey, everybody. This is Cheryl Fleck.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.400
My brother Graham, sister-in-law Patty,
and Danielle.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.800
-Here. Catch cookie.
-Thanks!

07:16.400 --> 07:19.840
(Danielle) <i>God, uncle Neil gives</i>
<i>the lamest presents on earth.</i>

07:19.920 --> 07:21.760
Come in. Come in.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.600
It's great to meet you.
I've heard so much about you both.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.320
-Oh...yes.
-(door closes)

07:27.920 --> 07:29.240
Well, um...

07:29.840 --> 07:31.840
Neil, could you help me
with our bags?

07:33.280 --> 07:34.440
Aren't those your bags there?

07:35.040 --> 07:36.440
Just help me a second.

07:37.040 --> 07:37.840
Sure.

07:41.040 --> 07:41.840
(clicks tongue)

07:43.600 --> 07:45.080
I love your foyer.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.720
Excuse me just,
uh, one minute.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.280
-Where's Marla?
-You know, actually, we broke up again.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.280
-Neil!
-Neil? Where is Marla?

08:00.360 --> 08:02.920
We broke up again.
Don't worry.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.400
Cheryl is incredible.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.640
You spend five minutes with her
in the car, you're going to love her.

08:10.760 --> 08:11.880
I hear this honk, right?

08:11.960 --> 08:15.040
And here's this cute guy in the next car
rolling down his window.

08:15.120 --> 08:19.600
I roll down mine. He holds up this paper
and shouts out to me,

08:19.680 --> 08:21.400
"this blew out of your car."

08:21.480 --> 08:24.400
I'm thinking, "my God,
what did I lose?"

08:24.480 --> 08:27.320
Right before
the light turns green,

08:27.400 --> 08:29.720
he holds the paper out.
I reach my arm out.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.280
People behind us are honking!
(laughs)

08:32.360 --> 08:34.160
He hands me the paper.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.800
I pull over to the side
of the road.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.880
Know what the paper says?

08:38.960 --> 08:40.600
Hi. I'm Neil.
Call me.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.760
Yeah. How did you know that?
How did he know that?

08:44.880 --> 08:48.200
(squealing laughter)

08:49.800 --> 08:52.120
Oh! Oh!

08:52.200 --> 08:55.320
I think I got a couple of doobies
in here somewhere.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.520
-Yay or nay?
-Nay.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.800
If you wanted to do something
with Rayanne this weekend,

09:05.880 --> 09:07.840
it's not like
I'd take it personally.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.240
-Angela, I want to hang here, okay?
-Okay.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.200
So did she ask about me?

09:21.760 --> 09:25.760
(Danielle) <i>It's so cool to be hanging</i>
<i>with my big sister and her cool friend.</i>

09:27.120 --> 09:29.560
Oh, do we like this?

09:30.480 --> 09:31.480
(scoffs)

09:38.040 --> 09:39.760
(door opens)

09:44.600 --> 09:46.400
Oh, I know, I'm...

09:47.480 --> 09:51.320
Camille almost forced me to wear it.
It's not me.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.400
(door closes)

09:53.600 --> 09:54.880
I think it's great.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.760
(chuckles)

09:58.600 --> 10:00.200
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.000
(kisses)

10:06.200 --> 10:08.120
I love sex in a different bed.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.520
(squeaking)

10:14.000 --> 10:15.720
(laughter)

10:17.160 --> 10:18.880
(laughter grows louder)

10:22.480 --> 10:24.560
-You know...
-Hmm?

10:25.120 --> 10:29.600
I wish Neil could've waited until after
this weekend to break up with Marla.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.040
Well, your concern
for Marla is touching.

10:34.120 --> 10:38.160
-Well...
-Oh, Patty, look, we're here.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.240
We finally have a weekend.
This is our opportunity to be together.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.480
Don't let this girl
ruin it for us.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.320
You're right.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.720
(squeaking)

10:52.800 --> 10:54.440
(moaning)

10:55.920 --> 10:57.160
(snorts)

10:57.720 --> 11:00.040
(both laughs)

11:02.080 --> 11:04.840
Doobies.
(laughs)

11:04.920 --> 11:07.080
(laughs)

11:12.120 --> 11:13.640
(snorts)

11:13.720 --> 11:15.480
(knocks on door)

11:15.560 --> 11:16.960
Coming!

11:17.040 --> 11:18.520
(door opens)

11:19.680 --> 11:21.840
I'm only here 'cause Katimski said
Rickie spent the night.

11:21.920 --> 11:26.080
Rickie, like, still owes me $6.50
that I really need...

11:26.760 --> 11:29.680
and 'cause this thing
Tino's got going...

11:33.160 --> 11:34.480
He's upstairs.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.160
Cool.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.400
(door closes)

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So I'll be home tomorrow night for dinner.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.240
Okay. You, too.
Bye, Mr. Katimski.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.920
-So...
-(door closes)

11:52.000 --> 11:54.040
I got to get
that $6.50 you owe me.

11:54.120 --> 11:57.520
I gave that to you,
like, 40 years ago.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.680
I wouldn't mind spending time here
with someone special.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.160
I love sex on a different bed.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.320
Does Angela know you're here?

12:04.920 --> 12:06.800
She knows. God.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.400
So you coming out
with me tonight?

12:09.480 --> 12:12.400
Rayanne, I told you.
I'm, like, here this weekend.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.520
Cool.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.200
So does, uh,
Angela ask about me?

12:24.360 --> 12:25.640
What's this?

12:25.720 --> 12:27.200
Rayanne, put it back.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.760
All right, Graham!
(laughs)

12:32.840 --> 12:35.160
This answers a lot
of questions about those two.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.200
Rayanne, give them to me.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.080
Oh, Graham, Graham, don't hurt me,
master.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.200
Wait.
It's the other way around.

12:41.280 --> 12:45.040
Graham, that dinner you prepared
just wasn't tasty enough,

12:45.120 --> 12:46.720
slave boy!

12:47.840 --> 12:50.480
Patty, I've been bad.
Punish me.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.920
This is, like, so unfunny.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.320
(laughs)

12:53.400 --> 12:55.960
Where did you put the key.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.240
What did you do with the key?

13:00.720 --> 13:01.880
What?

13:01.960 --> 13:03.080
I can't believe this.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.760
-I cannot believe this.
-Calm yourself.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.320
It's here. We'll find it.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.600
(door opens)

13:13.800 --> 13:18.120
Looks like I might be staying
a little longer than I thought.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.640
Wow.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.120
Camille,
everything is going just fine.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.040
I'm not whispering.

13:35.840 --> 13:38.960
I was just wondering
if you could go over to the house

13:39.040 --> 13:40.320
and check on the kids for me.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.640
-(toilet flushes)
-Thanks.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.160
Oh, and while you're there,
(chuckles)

13:45.240 --> 13:49.360
I left those handcuffy things,
you know, on the bed.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.920
I feel really weird
about the kids finding them.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.520
Thanks. Got to go.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.320
-Ready for breakfast?
-Yeah.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.760
-Who was that?
-Oh, just checking on the kids.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.680
They're fine.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.120
(door closes)

14:03.720 --> 14:05.400
You're not listening to me.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.960
This is what I believe. It's part of
who I am. You have to accept that.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.200
I cannot believe
you're saying this.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.480
I have to tell you,

14:13.560 --> 14:16.320
you are clutching onto
some very distorted ideas.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.240
I am entitled to my beliefs.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.240
No, th...

14:20.800 --> 14:21.720
Sit.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.880
I mean, you're being a little unrealistic,
aren't you,

14:24.960 --> 14:28.000
calling the '71 Pirates
one of the great teams?

14:28.080 --> 14:29.560
-(laughs)
-Oh, you're just...

14:29.640 --> 14:32.560
After Roberto Clemente
and Willie Stargell

14:32.640 --> 14:35.720
the team got extremely thin.
There hasn't been a more overrated team.

14:35.800 --> 14:40.200
(groans) Overrated? Oh, just stab me.
Somebody, please, stab me.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.560
Don't tempt me.

14:41.640 --> 14:42.840
(laughter)

14:46.320 --> 14:48.200
So you know
what I think?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.600
Ice skating.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.440
-Oh.
-Oh.

14:52.520 --> 14:58.160
Apparently there's this really incredible
frozen pond that we can hike to.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.080
Let's play that one by ear.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.160
We only have a limited
amount of time up here,

15:03.240 --> 15:05.800
so we should plan
what we want to do.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.720
(clicks tongue)
We should have a really nice, fun day.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.880
If we plan,
we can fill it with fun things.

15:12.960 --> 15:17.280
-I haven't ice-skated in a while.
-It's freezing!

15:17.360 --> 15:21.040
I think it's a cute idea. She's so cute!
(giggles)

15:21.120 --> 15:23.760
-Great.
-(both laughs)

15:23.840 --> 15:27.520
Come on, Graham.
You're so athletic. You'll be great.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.560
Fine. Fine. Fine.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.880
-Yeah, sure. Whatever.
-You are such a cutie.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.640
We're going to have
so much fun.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.440
-You don't have keys to your handcuffs?
-They're not exactly mine.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.480
Right. They belong to some
really perverted guy or something.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.680
Yeah, or your parents.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.040
What?

15:53.640 --> 15:55.760
I found them right here
on the bed.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.160
-They were not.
-Ask Rickie.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.520
-Mm-hmm.
-Those things do not belong to my parents.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.400
-Wow.
-Danielle, leave.

16:05.480 --> 16:09.560
-I'm serious. Mom left me in charge.
-Duh.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.240
I'm not leaving.
I live here.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.040
(doorbell rings)

16:15.080 --> 16:16.600
Great. Wonderful.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.800
There's got to be a key.
Find it.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.480
I'll explain this to you later...
like when you're 30.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.000
(door opens)

16:25.080 --> 16:28.840
Angela! Danielle!
Anybody?

16:28.920 --> 16:31.240
Uh, my mom's not home.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.640
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.640
We just stopped by to make sure
everything was okay.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.040
Well, it is, so... thanks.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.080
You've got to see
this jumpsuit.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.400
I know what you're thinking,
but look.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.720
It's so cute.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.040
-Wait. Where you going?
-I left something in your mom's room.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.880
I'll get it for you.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.600
-That's all right.
-No. I want to.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.120
Why?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.120
That's so exactly the point,
why.

16:55.200 --> 16:59.480
Because of respect for elders,
which is lost in today's world.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.960
What did you need?

17:01.040 --> 17:04.280
-It's not important.
-We need to talk.

17:04.360 --> 17:05.880
About...

17:08.560 --> 17:09.680
Justice.

17:11.800 --> 17:16.360
Wow. I cannot believe that you actually
run your own company.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.240
-Every day.
-(scoffs)

17:18.320 --> 17:20.560
I would love
to do that someday.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.120
That or have
a cappuccino cart.

17:25.080 --> 17:28.080
I'm sure you can do anything
you put your mind to.

17:28.160 --> 17:32.120
You got this great job.
You got this husband and children.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.520
It must be so satisfying.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.000
With me, there's so many paths
I could choose.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.400
Every single possibility of life
is, like, open to me.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.320
But you...

17:46.120 --> 17:49.880
I mean, your choices...
have been made.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.560
Your life is totally settled.

17:53.560 --> 17:57.000
It must really be like...
comforting.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.320
Yeah, it is.

18:00.560 --> 18:04.720
Okay. It looks like we can
book spelunking for the afternoon.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.720
It starts at three.

18:05.800 --> 18:10.680
If we get back from skating at one,
we can grab a quick bite.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.360
Could you, like,
plan my entire life for me?

18:13.440 --> 18:15.000
-You won't believe this.
-What?

18:15.080 --> 18:17.560
This place doesn't
serve alcohol. None.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.760
-Well, it's really not that big of a deal.
-This is my worst nightmare.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.200
Do we really need alcohol
to have fun?

18:25.280 --> 18:26.200
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.560
It's Saturday night.
I want to party down.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.320
There's liquor in town.
Give me the car keys.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.360
No way.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.520
-Not after what you did to my Duster.
-(laughs)

18:35.600 --> 18:38.160
That was so long ago.
I can't believe you.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.280
-No, no.
-(laughs)

18:39.360 --> 18:41.040
Fine.
We'll all go then.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.840
-Oh, yeah. It'll be fun.
-Oh, come on.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.960
Is this how we'll spend our weekend,
hunting for liquor?

18:47.040 --> 18:48.840
(laughs)

18:51.480 --> 18:53.720
Fine.
I'll stay here.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.640
I'll rent the skates.
You'll be back soon, won't you?

18:56.720 --> 18:59.360
Of course.
How long could it take?

18:59.440 --> 19:01.680
-(kisses)
-(indistinct chatter)

19:03.600 --> 19:05.160
(door closes)

19:05.240 --> 19:06.480
The point is,

19:06.560 --> 19:08.480
do I have to keep
a top I don't like

19:08.560 --> 19:11.400
just because I'm beyond the 30-day
exchange policy?

19:11.480 --> 19:13.520
I mean, is that justice?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.080
Why are you
obsessing over this?

19:17.280 --> 19:20.160
-I got to go.
-Do I tell them I don't like the top?

19:20.240 --> 19:25.000
It's just this thing
that sits in my closet.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.040
Wait a minute.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.560
Is this that lavender top
I got you for your birthday?

19:28.640 --> 19:32.720
-If it is, I really don't care.
-No! Wait!

19:32.800 --> 19:34.600
Wait! Please!
Don't go in there!

19:35.800 --> 19:37.680
-Angela.
-(door opens)

19:39.000 --> 19:40.760
Oh, my.
Are you all right?

19:45.960 --> 19:48.160
Rayanne's not
feeling very well.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.600
I need water.
Water, water.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.520
(groaning)

19:54.440 --> 19:55.880
(laughs)

19:56.480 --> 19:58.400
Oh, my God.
I think she's choking.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.240
Angela, can you breathe?

20:01.320 --> 20:02.320
Can you breathe?

20:04.800 --> 20:09.960
Rayanne's really, um...
it's sort of happened.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.000
She just fainted.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.120
Well, not so much
fainted as swooned.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.720
(coughing)

20:15.800 --> 20:19.080
Oh!
Oh!

20:19.160 --> 20:21.520
So this is that thing
that's going around, right?

20:21.600 --> 20:23.320
It's that, um... that thing?

20:28.760 --> 20:31.480
Angela, can I see you
for just a moment?

20:33.320 --> 20:34.360
Sure.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.920
-(groaning)
-(door closes)

20:38.000 --> 20:41.480
Is that the same Rayanne
that has the drinking problem?

20:42.640 --> 20:45.400
This has nothing to do with that.
I promise.

20:45.480 --> 20:46.920
Does your mother know
she's here?

20:48.200 --> 20:49.720
Oh, of course.

20:51.920 --> 20:52.880
Good.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.960
Okay, um...
keep your eye on her.

20:57.040 --> 21:00.440
If she's not feeling better,
you call me, okay?

21:11.560 --> 21:12.600
Hi again.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.640
I guess no one's
called for me, right?

21:16.720 --> 21:19.240
Not since the last time
you asked, no.

21:21.040 --> 21:21.880
No.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.400
Maybe we better cancel
that spelunking reservation.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.680
Yes, I think so.
The tour started an hour ago.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.680
(chiming)

21:35.280 --> 21:38.360
This is really
a great place.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.240
Thank you.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.720
Have you been here
your whole life?

21:42.920 --> 21:44.200
Not yet.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.600
Bye.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.320
(door opens)

21:59.800 --> 22:01.240
(kisses)

22:29.200 --> 22:32.480
(Patty) <i>There will be more of</i>
My So Called Life <i>here on ABC.</i>

22:37.400 --> 22:39.960
(theme music playing)

22:48.120 --> 22:50.960
Here's the thing
about the handcuffs.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.200
We thought
you might be confused.

22:53.280 --> 22:57.360
-We don't want you to think...
-They're not mom and dad's.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.000
Right. They're like... for fun.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.440
-They're like... a toy.
-(both) A toy.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.520
Hey, I don't care.
I'm not even interested.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.560
-Oh.
-Good.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.160
(door opens)

23:10.240 --> 23:12.480
(Danielle) <i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Now I'm interested.</i>

23:20.000 --> 23:20.880
Look.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.080
I made a swan.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.320
(laughs)

23:32.320 --> 23:34.080
-(door closes)
-(indistinct chatter)

23:34.160 --> 23:37.800
-That cop! Could you believe him?
-That town is so weird.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.640
-We all got tickets for jaywalking.
-(all laughs)

23:39.720 --> 23:41.240
Well, well.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.800
Did you at least
get some wine?

23:44.480 --> 23:47.480
-Wine. Uh... no.
-(all laughs)

23:49.000 --> 23:52.120
But we did scare up some...

23:52.200 --> 23:55.320
Dr. Alan's
ginger-flavored brandy.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.280
-(all laughs)
-Ta-da!

23:59.200 --> 24:00.880
Is that Graham's sweater
that you're wearing?

24:00.960 --> 24:05.520
-It's so comfy and cozy.
-Uh, yeah. Cheryl got kind of cold.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.280
Oh.
Why didn't you loan her your jacket?

24:09.880 --> 24:12.360
Are you kidding?
I was freezing.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.320
-(all laughs)
-Jerk.

24:23.880 --> 24:27.200
Rickie, will you go down and help Sharon
and Danielle with lunch?

24:27.280 --> 24:28.760
I need to talk
to Angela alone.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.200
Sure.

24:33.560 --> 24:36.960
(exhales) Angela, I know we're
not that close right now...

24:37.040 --> 24:39.120
I don't want
to get into this.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.520
Get into what?

24:41.120 --> 24:44.680
Some big discussion about what
happened between you and Jordan,

24:44.760 --> 24:47.560
because it happened
and nothing can change that.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.120
I don't want to talk about it.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.560
Neither do I.

24:51.640 --> 24:52.640
Oh.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.440
So why did you
ask Rickie to leave?

24:57.520 --> 24:59.160
I have to go to the bathroom.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.320
(scoffs)

25:01.400 --> 25:03.400
I need you to get me a jar.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.520
I can't believe you.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.840
-What's that?
-Oh, it's nothing.

25:16.880 --> 25:17.760
(scoffs)

25:19.680 --> 25:22.160
Okay.
This is pretty embarrassing.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.480
Camille brought over
that negligee...

25:26.640 --> 25:29.200
she also brought over
some handcuffs.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.760
(laughs)

25:30.840 --> 25:32.720
Camille Cherski
has handcuffs?

25:34.760 --> 25:36.320
Well, let's see them.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.280
I didn't actually bring them.

25:38.880 --> 25:39.760
Oh.

25:40.680 --> 25:42.480
-Should I have?
-No.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.520
I mean...

25:44.280 --> 25:47.880
-it might have been...
-I... yeah, I guess so.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.360
Camille Cherski?

25:53.440 --> 25:56.920
Those handcuffs
do not belong to my parents.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.280
-Of course, not.
-Never.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.080
How much more of this
am I supposed to take?

26:02.920 --> 26:04.080
Anyone?

26:06.400 --> 26:07.600
Cherski?

26:08.200 --> 26:09.280
Pass.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.920
Bachelor number two,
same question.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.800
I hate to say it, but...

26:15.480 --> 26:19.400
you know who could actually be,
like, capable of figuring this out?

26:19.480 --> 26:21.400
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

26:22.520 --> 26:23.440
Forget it.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.200
Oh, my God.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.480
(Danielle)
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

26:29.560 --> 26:32.960
<i>When he walked through the door,</i>
<i>his arm touched my shoulder.</i>

26:34.000 --> 26:37.080
<i>I thought I would faint.</i>
<i>I mean, swoon.</i>

26:38.400 --> 26:40.640
-Ow! Gentle.
-Sorry.

26:42.320 --> 26:45.320
Well, this is really simple.
A child could get her out of this.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.480
Um...
all we need is wire shears.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.320
I mean, any dad has them.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.320
Not my dad,
but a normal dad.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.360
Like your dad
probably has them.

26:58.440 --> 26:59.560
He doesn't.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.760
Oh.
So... fine.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.600
We can just go to
the hardware store Monday.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.720
Great. Monday.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.520
Perfect.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.320
I just think this place
is beautiful.

27:15.400 --> 27:19.680
I know that we got off
to a rocky start today,

27:19.760 --> 27:23.200
but Warren's willing to be
flexible about the checkout time.

27:23.280 --> 27:27.160
We can have seven full hours
of daylight tomorrow to have fun.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.120
Whoa.
That's really bad.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.080
(all giggles)

27:32.960 --> 27:35.400
No. I'm an adult.
I won't break the rules.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.120
I have never met
anyone like you.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.600
-Patty's not a big drinker.
-Too mature for us.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.040
By a lot.

27:42.120 --> 27:46.760
Oh, come on. You make me sound
so stuck-up or something.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.400
(sighs)

27:52.480 --> 27:53.440
Fine.

27:54.360 --> 27:56.240
Give me that...
hooch.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.760
Aw, honey.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.400
You said hooch
in a sentence.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.480
-Ohh.
-(giggles)

28:13.200 --> 28:15.520
Hey, that's not so bad.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.600
-Whoo!
-(all laughs)

28:21.200 --> 28:22.120
Cheers.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.800
(Danielle)
<i>He was a genius.</i>

28:28.440 --> 28:32.320
<i>I had goose bumps</i>
<i>just watching him think.</i>

28:34.920 --> 28:38.640
We'll find a place that sells handcuffs
by the same manufacturer.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.120
They would use
the same key.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.440
There's this place
called the pleasure center.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.720
They might have
that sort of stuff.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.240
Ooh.
Pleasure center?

28:48.320 --> 28:51.320
I've passed by it. Jeez.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.920
Well, fine.
So someone has to go.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.720
I don't know where it is.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.480
Don't worry.
I'll show you.

29:04.640 --> 29:07.080
(all laughs)

29:08.320 --> 29:10.920
Oh, no. It's all gone.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.040
No problemo.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.040
Oh, I love you, Cherl.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.200
Let's just break this puppy open.
Yes, sir-ree.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.880
Hey, honey,
maybe you've had enough.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.760
No. Oh.

29:26.360 --> 29:29.480
(laughs)
You think that I'm drunk.

29:31.200 --> 29:35.320
Oops. Mayday, mayday.
Play it cool. (whistles)

29:38.480 --> 29:41.240
How are you all
enjoying this evening?

29:41.320 --> 29:42.760
-It's great.
-Yummy.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.720
Isn't it yummy?
Yummy.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.320
(all laughs)

29:46.400 --> 29:48.560
No, I'm sorry.
It's really good.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.320
Oh.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.120
-That means...
-No, I...

29:53.200 --> 29:55.000
He hates it.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.480
But don't feel bad,
Warren,

29:57.560 --> 30:01.080
because, you see,
he's a food snob,

30:01.160 --> 30:06.040
and he hates anything
that he doesn't fix himself.

30:06.120 --> 30:10.000
-Patty...
-No! Warren is a very sensitive person.

30:10.080 --> 30:14.360
He's my friend,
and we speak all the time now.

30:14.440 --> 30:15.960
(laughs)

30:16.040 --> 30:17.520
As a matter of fact,

30:17.600 --> 30:21.000
we speaked today
when you left me here all alone.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.520
Right, Warren?

30:29.040 --> 30:30.880
(all laughs)

30:32.440 --> 30:34.280
Well, we pulled that off, okay.

30:34.360 --> 30:38.280
-(all laughs)
-Ooh, that was close.

30:38.360 --> 30:41.560
-(door opens and closes)
-You would not believe

30:41.640 --> 30:43.680
who we ran into around the corner
from the pleasure center.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.560
Oh, Kyle.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.560
Kyle.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.760
Oh, God, that feels good.

30:53.840 --> 30:57.800
Kyle, no. I told you.
You have to go.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.000
You can't come in.

30:59.960 --> 31:03.280
Kyle, no.
Down.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.120
Can't I just come in to,
like, use the bathroom?

31:08.440 --> 31:09.240
Oh.

31:10.840 --> 31:12.560
Wake up.
I got them.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.800
Krakow, we never did it
with you on top before.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.240
Let's keep this professional.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.680
But you're my knight
in shining armor.

31:22.560 --> 31:23.480
Wait a second.

31:24.320 --> 31:26.160
This key's too big.
It won't fit.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.000
Krakow, you're such an idiot.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.480
-Quit moving, will you?
-No!

31:29.560 --> 31:31.280
-It's too big!
-(door opens)

31:33.000 --> 31:34.640
(nervously chuckles)
Hi.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.880
(dramatic music playing)

31:42.080 --> 31:43.880
(door closes and opens)

31:44.960 --> 31:49.400
Phil... Brian Krakow has
Rayanne Graff chained to a bed...

31:50.040 --> 31:51.400
and they're all watching.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.680
(laughs)

31:52.760 --> 31:55.520
(Rayanne) Krakow, stop!
It's too big! It won't fit!

31:55.600 --> 31:56.560
(laughs)

31:56.640 --> 31:58.640
(Patty)
No. Wait a second.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.000
-So after you broke up with...
-Uh... Kirk.

32:01.080 --> 32:04.200
Why didn't you go back to
the one with freckles?

32:04.280 --> 32:05.960
I like freckles.

32:06.040 --> 32:11.760
It all worked out for the best because
Neil is so sweet. You are so sweet.

32:11.840 --> 32:16.560
Uh, wait a second. Neil here has
got an old commitment problem.

32:16.640 --> 32:20.560
He just doesn't want to step up
to the bat.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.840
Hey.

32:21.920 --> 32:27.720
Whoa. It's Mr. "Bed
and breakfast" man.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.800
(clapping)

32:30.360 --> 32:32.400
Could I get you folks
anything else?

32:32.480 --> 32:34.360
We were just going up
to our rooms.

32:34.440 --> 32:38.160
What a wonderful idea...
for our other patrons.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.360
No. Wait.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.480
I want...
an ice-cream sundae.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.480
Oh.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.560
Patty, maybe we should
call it a night.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.120
One ice-cream sundae.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.560
Mm-hmm.

32:53.760 --> 32:57.800
What we need to lighten this situation up
is an after-dinner drink.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.280
-Cheers.
-Down the hatch, honey.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.360
(laughs)

33:02.440 --> 33:05.040
Oh, no.
I spilled.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.200
Oh, wait a second.
I know.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.680
Somebody loan me a sweater.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.720
(laughing)

33:15.800 --> 33:17.440
Did you get that?
Did you get it?

33:17.520 --> 33:21.760
No. Wait a second. This is going to stain.
Oh, God.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.800
-I think I'd better soak it.
-Oh, Patty! Don't.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.040
All right.
That's enough!

33:28.120 --> 33:31.920
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you all
to go to your rooms.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.320
Go to my room?
Excuse me.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.320
I am an adult.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.920
That is a judgment call, ma'am.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.560
No. What about
my ice cream?

33:42.640 --> 33:46.200
Nobody is getting
any ice cream tonight.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.440
<i>âª I want ice cream âª</i>

33:48.520 --> 33:51.080
Oh, come on, Warren,
how about one little scoop?

33:52.320 --> 33:54.160
I thought we were friends.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.360
Hey. This isn't so bad.

33:57.440 --> 33:58.920
This is fun.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.320
I really admire her.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.120
(laughing uproariously)

34:03.200 --> 34:04.280
(sighs)

34:21.320 --> 34:22.320
Wait. Come in.

34:24.240 --> 34:25.480
You're awake?

34:25.560 --> 34:26.840
I can't sleep.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.640
Too bored to sleep.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.560
-Could you do me a favor?
-I could for money.

34:33.160 --> 34:35.160
A girl after my very own heart.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.200
Okay. Here's what you do.

34:38.280 --> 34:39.960
You go down
to the liquor cabinet,

34:40.040 --> 34:42.360
you get me a bottle,
anything brown.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.600
-I'll give you $1.00.
-Nope.

34:44.680 --> 34:46.200
$2.00.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.880
It's wrong to drink.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.760
You have a real
miserable side to you.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.800
My parents say
you're a bad influence.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.800
I heard them talking
about the things you do.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.320
Why do you do them?

34:59.240 --> 35:00.160
I don't know.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.560
See...

35:06.040 --> 35:10.000
Okay. When I look at myself, I see
everything in slow-motion and I think,

35:10.080 --> 35:12.120
"something has to happen."

35:14.440 --> 35:17.200
Only it never does,
so I have to make it happen.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.200
Wow.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.160
They're brown.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.960
That they are.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.400
Good morning, sunshine.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.800
Uh, by the way,
we've been asked to leave.

35:48.840 --> 35:49.920
Ah.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.560
Oh... oh. Um...

36:04.920 --> 36:06.480
(door opens)

36:09.760 --> 36:12.840
I would just like
to apologize for, uh...

36:14.920 --> 36:17.280
what happened, um...
last night.

36:17.360 --> 36:22.840
And also, Cheryl, I'd like to say
I think I didn't give you a fair chance.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.200
To do what?

36:26.320 --> 36:30.000
Why don't the four of us get together
when we get back? Go out.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.480
Cheryl and I decided
to keep things casual for now.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.120
-Oh.
-(scoffs)

36:36.160 --> 36:41.720
We didn't decide "to keep things casual."
We broke up. You don't want to see me.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.280
I got out of the shower this morning,
and Neil was on the phone with Marla.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.920
I guess it was partly my fault.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.880
I take really short showers.

36:55.800 --> 36:59.200
I'm having second thoughts about
you taking apart my parents' bed.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.400
Just do it.

37:00.480 --> 37:04.440
I'm not taking apart the whole bed,
just the headboard.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.200
(thuds)

37:08.280 --> 37:09.840
(bell rings)

37:17.160 --> 37:19.200
Look, can I just say...

37:20.320 --> 37:22.960
oh, God,
how do I put this?

37:24.880 --> 37:29.080
I acted totally like an idiot,
made a fool of myself.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.880
But you shouldn't have
left me alone all day

37:31.960 --> 37:33.360
while you were
on your liquor hunt.

37:33.440 --> 37:36.440
I had no idea
it would take so long.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.920
Anyway, it seemed
to matter to them.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.720
What about what matters to me?

37:41.800 --> 37:45.400
There I am, I'm waiting
and I'm worrying

37:45.480 --> 37:48.280
and I'm feeling like the minutes
are ticking by.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.800
Then you tell me you're late
because you had to look under her hood.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.120
What are we
talking about here?

38:00.040 --> 38:04.840
You know, I have to say
I think it was really fun.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.240
We should all
do it again sometime...

38:10.200 --> 38:12.240
I mean, only without Neil.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.400
Okay. On three.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.120
1...2...3.

38:21.080 --> 38:24.240
Yes! I'm free!
Krakow, you're a genius.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.920
(kisses)
Okay. I'm outta here.

38:26.600 --> 38:27.800
You're leaving?

38:28.280 --> 38:29.960
I can still make something
out of this weekend.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.640
Don't you dare leave.

38:31.720 --> 38:35.240
-Hands off.
-My parents will never trust me again.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.040
You're crossing the line.

38:37.120 --> 38:40.560
You're like this curse
that's destroying my life.

38:40.640 --> 38:44.200
You can't just walk out and
expect us to clean up after you.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.680
You're a bad luck omen.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.880
-Don't mince words.
-Tell me how you feel.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.000
-Okay.
-(indistinct chatter)

38:51.080 --> 38:54.360
-I can't take it anymore.
-Hey. Hey! Hey!

38:55.200 --> 38:57.000
Mom's going to be home
in 20 minutes.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.520
(dramatic music playing)

39:06.440 --> 39:08.480
-I can't get it in.
-Rookie.

39:21.880 --> 39:24.000
Uh!
Oh!

39:24.080 --> 39:25.400
Lower. Lower.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.400
Good.
Higher. Higher.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.800
-Okay.
-Ow! Ow! Finger. Finger.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.520
(door opens)

39:46.160 --> 39:47.200
Hello?

39:53.360 --> 39:55.200
(man on TV)
<i>Boy, it's a nice one.</i>

39:55.280 --> 39:58.640
<i>Bob Hamilton Jr. has just caught</i>
<i>his first fish of the morning...</i>

39:58.720 --> 40:00.400
-Hi.
-Hi.

40:01.880 --> 40:02.680
Hi.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.520
Oh. Rayanne came over.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.320
-Great.
-And I did.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.080
-Me, too.
-Gee.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.320
-Ahem.
-Sorry.

40:17.560 --> 40:19.360
What are you kids
doing up here?

40:21.200 --> 40:22.440
Oh, we were just...

40:23.640 --> 40:28.240
I would really prefer it if you all
wouldn't watch TV in my room.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.200
You're really right.
I'm sorry.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.640
-We were only up here because...
-Angela.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.160
How was your weekend?

40:34.240 --> 40:36.600
(exhales)
Nothing special.

40:37.720 --> 40:40.120
-Uh, yours?
-Just... the usual.

40:40.200 --> 40:43.760
-Angela!
-What, Danielle? What is it?

40:43.840 --> 40:46.480
I really missed you.

40:46.560 --> 40:51.800
Oh... Danielle, sweetheart.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.840
I really missed you, too.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.200
(kisses)

41:00.600 --> 41:01.720
(metal clinks)

41:03.080 --> 41:06.200
We'll just get out of your way.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.160
Bye, Angela.
Bye, everyone.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.880
Bye. See ya.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.800
(door closes)

41:15.800 --> 41:16.920
What a weird weekend.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.280
I know.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.720
And we never even
had a chance...

41:24.800 --> 41:26.520
to reconnect.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.000
(kisses)

41:34.440 --> 41:35.400
Ow.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.840
Oh, my God.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.560
Camille never
picked them up.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.440
(man on TV) <i>Probably the next thing</i>
<i>on the market</i>

41:49.520 --> 41:51.560
<i>will be Paul Elias</i>
<i>fish-biting sneakers.</i>

41:59.640 --> 42:01.480
(giggling)

42:01.560 --> 42:02.640
(handcuffs clicking)

42:02.720 --> 42:04.400
(laughing)

42:06.160 --> 42:07.360
Patty, wait a second.

42:08.320 --> 42:11.440
-Where's the key?
-Oh, my God.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.000
(door opens)

42:13.080 --> 42:14.520
-Thanks.
-(kisses)

42:14.600 --> 42:15.520
Be good.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.120
Can I talk to Rayanne
for a minute alone?

42:24.240 --> 42:26.200
(door closes)

42:26.280 --> 42:29.400
Look, I don't want to get into
any big discussion or anything.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.640
Oh, neither do I.

42:30.720 --> 42:31.680
Oh.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.840
Then why'd you
ask me to stay?

42:34.920 --> 42:35.960
For the key.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.880
I knew you couldn't resist.

42:47.960 --> 42:52.920
-Party pooper.
-(door opens and closes)

42:54.920 --> 42:57.040
Weekend from hell.

42:57.120 --> 43:00.640
(Danielle) <i>That was the best weekend</i>
<i>of my entire life.</i>

43:01.440 --> 43:04.440
By the way... thanks.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.200
So what are we doing
next weekend?

43:07.280 --> 43:09.800
We are not doing anything.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.040
-We could see what Brian's doing.
-Danielle.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.400
-I kind of like Brian.
-Danielle.

43:25.200 --> 43:29.800
(announcer) <i>We'll be back with scenes</i>
<i>from the season's finale.</i>

43:33.800 --> 43:37.680
(announcer) <i>Here are some scenes</i>
<i>from next week's season finale.</i>

43:42.200 --> 43:43.920
(laughing)

43:44.000 --> 43:46.880
-This isn't funny.
-I'm sorry.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.160
Well, come on,
it's a little funny.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.000
Okay, okay, okay.

43:52.080 --> 43:55.200
I'm looking. I'm looking.
I'm looking.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.440
(sighs)

43:57.520 --> 43:59.800
Gosh, honey,
I just don't see a key.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.920
It's got to be there.
I just had it.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.400
Did you check behind
the dresser?

44:05.000 --> 44:05.880
Graham.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.840
-Graham?
-Wait a sec.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.800
Graham, will you forget
that fishing stuff?

44:11.880 --> 44:14.760
(man on TV) <i>It's exciting when you</i>
<i>catch 'em like this, one after the other.</i>

44:14.840 --> 44:17.440
<i>It can't help but be exciting...</i>

44:17.520 --> 44:19.200
Whoa.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.800
Look at the size of that baby.

44:21.880 --> 44:24.320
-That's a keeper.
-I don't believe this.

44:24.400 --> 44:29.240
-See you fry that up. I don't believe...
-I don't believe this.

44:30.200 --> 44:32.880
Oh, oh, hey.
You know what we need?

44:32.960 --> 44:35.520
-Wire shears.
-Wait. Don't leave yet.

44:35.600 --> 44:38.840
The type of guy who has wire shears,
Bob Krakow.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.840
I'll ask Bob Krakow
if I can borrow his wire shears.

44:40.920 --> 44:45.360
Wait! Don't leave yet.
I'll be right back.

44:45.440 --> 44:46.880
-(door shuts)
-(sighs)

44:46.960 --> 44:48.240
What else is on?

44:50.680 --> 44:52.640
(indistinct chatter on television)

44:59.320 --> 45:03.800
<i>He doesn't seem to be concentrating on</i>
<i>any particular part of the boat dock.</i>

45:03.880 --> 45:08.720
<i>He's just trying to saturate</i>
<i>the whole dock with the jig.</i>

45:08.800 --> 45:10.720
<i>He made a comment earlier to us</i>

45:10.800 --> 45:14.240
<i>that most of his strikes</i>
<i>yesterday came after ten o'clock</i>

45:14.320 --> 45:18.280
<i>when the bass were beginning</i>
<i>to relate to the cover a lot better.</i>

45:20.640 --> 45:24.800
<i>âª And dance by the light</i>
<i>Of the moon âª</i>
