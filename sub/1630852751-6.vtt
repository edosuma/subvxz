00:15.140 --> 00:18.268
<i>For Terry, every day</i>
<i>means a new murder case,</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:21.771
<i>and a new celebrity guest star</i>
<i>as his partner.</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:26.484
<i>Today's guest:</i>
<i>actor and comedian Ken Jeong.</i>

00:26.985 --> 00:28.653
<i>But here's the catch.</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:30.822
<i>Ken isn't being given a script.</i>

00:30.905 --> 00:33.825
<i>He has no idea what's about to happen.</i>

00:34.325 --> 00:38.872
<i>Together, he and Terry will have</i>
<i>to improvise their way through the case.</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:42.083
<i>But it'll be up to Ken alone</i>
<i>to name the killer.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:46.087
<i>So join them</i>
<i>as they punch a one-way ticket</i>

00:46.921 --> 00:48.631
<i>to Murderville.</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:58.016
<i>There's an ancient saying,</i>

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
<i>"Success depends</i>
<i>upon previous preparation,</i>

01:00.935 --> 01:03.897
<i>and without such preparation</i>
<i>there is sure to be failure."</i>

01:03.980 --> 01:07.150
<i>I always remember that quote</i>
<i>because of how stupid it is.</i>

01:07.233 --> 01:11.279
<i>Preparation is for losers.</i>
<i>Dumb luck is where it's at.</i>

01:11.362 --> 01:15.742
Big news, everyone!
We just got a break in Lori's cold case!

01:15.825 --> 01:19.287
Yes! Right there, right there,
right there, right there, come on,

01:19.370 --> 01:22.916
come on, come on, get in, get in here,
get in here, you dawg, get in--

01:22.999 --> 01:25.710
…here, Daz-- didn't realize it was you.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.171
Might have to take that hug back later
when I don't like you again.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.216
Ah, you can't take hugs back, Terry.
Nobody owns hugs.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.676
Okay. Whatever, weirdo.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.975
Why were you just hugging Daz?

01:41.059 --> 01:42.227
Did you plant drugs on him?

01:42.310 --> 01:45.563
Chief, remember how my partner Lori
was murdered fifteen years ago,

01:45.647 --> 01:48.900
and her case has haunted me ever since,
and it eventually ruined our marriage?

01:48.983 --> 01:49.567
Yes?

01:49.651 --> 01:51.277
Last night, the phone on Lori's desk.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.531
This desk that I've left
completely untouched for fifteen years,

01:54.614 --> 01:55.907
that phone rang.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.784
And a man on the other end of that phone,

01:57.867 --> 02:01.830
he said that he had something
very important to tell me about Lori.

02:01.913 --> 02:02.997
What was it?

02:03.081 --> 02:05.458
That her dry cleaning
needed to be picked up.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.213
That's right.
Apparently they have a very strict policy

02:10.296 --> 02:12.215
about items left
over fifteen years or something.

02:12.298 --> 02:17.929
Anyway, I went there to pick it up
and guess what I found in her jacket?

02:20.181 --> 02:21.015
Tommy Tune?

02:21.599 --> 02:22.725
Oh, sorry, wrong pocket.

02:25.812 --> 02:30.150
This. A notebook. In Lori's handwriting.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.402
Written entirely in code.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.695
Yeah, let me see that.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.824
I mean, I knew that Lori was working

02:37.907 --> 02:40.118
on an investigation off the books
at the time of her death, I just--

02:40.827 --> 02:42.453
If we could crack that code, Chief,

02:42.537 --> 02:46.124
we might be able to find out
who killed her and why.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.085
It could be something,
it could be nothing. I'll look into it.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.421
In the meantime
I've got you a new partner.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.506
What? No, no. Chief, not today.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.008
Come on, you're kidding me.
Today of all days?

02:55.091 --> 02:56.050
Come on in, Ken!

02:59.804 --> 03:01.055
- Hey.
- Hi, how are you doing?

03:01.139 --> 03:04.100
Ken.
This is Senior Detective Terry Seattle.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.727
Terry, this is your new partner.

03:05.810 --> 03:06.728
- Ken Jeong.
- Well.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.230
- Hi.
- No offense, Ken, but…

03:09.314 --> 03:12.025
I already got myself a partner.
It's called my gun.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.446
- Jeez.
- Wait a second. Where's my gun?

03:16.529 --> 03:17.906
Hold on. Hold on one second.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.826
Hey, can you get me Dennis in Firearms?

03:22.619 --> 03:24.454
Hey, listen, it happened again.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.624
I don't know, maybe like on a tray
at Panda Express.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.417
Or try Ruby Tuesday's.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.335
Okay.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.297
- Have fun, you two.
- Thank you.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.465
Pop a seat.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.341
Okay.

03:39.093 --> 03:42.096
Ken Jeong. Tell me about yourself.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.099
Married, two kids.
I love to solve puzzles.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.559
What kind of vocation are you in?

03:46.643 --> 03:49.520
Before, actually, I used to have
a day job. I used to be a doctor.

03:49.604 --> 03:50.563
- I used to be a physician.
- Wow!

03:50.647 --> 03:54.400
Yeah. But it wasn't really my calling
and I wanted to do something else.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.902
What else? Doctor…?

03:55.985 --> 04:01.658
Oh, well, I also wanted to go into
entertainment and the arts and…

04:02.825 --> 04:05.745
Why? Why would you think
you could do that?

04:06.329 --> 04:08.706
To me, it's just something
I've always wanted to do.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.377
Now, that's funny. Very funny.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.336
I wanted to go to space.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.255
- But, you know…
- Right, right. Right, right.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.631
So that didn't pan out.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.759
Yeah, so… right, and…

04:19.842 --> 04:23.137
But I do love to push myself
and I would love to

04:23.221 --> 04:25.139
assist you in any way I can.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.433
I like the cut of your jib, Ken Jeong,
and I tell you what,

04:27.517 --> 04:29.269
I'm gonna let you in
on a little trade secret.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.144
Okay.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.604
When you want to…

04:31.688 --> 04:35.149
keep a suspect off balance,
the best thing you can do

04:35.233 --> 04:37.277
is constantly change the tone…

04:38.194 --> 04:40.655
and also the volume of your voice.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.366
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.617
Do you get that?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.286
- That shocked you.
- Yeah.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.036
Okay.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.414
Now, I want you to tell me the story
of <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>,

04:49.497 --> 04:50.540
keeping that in mind.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.582
Go. I'll be coaching you.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.585
- Little Red Riding Hood…
- Lower.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.589
was going on her way…

04:58.673 --> 05:01.217
- Happy.
- to give…

05:01.301 --> 05:03.136
- Louder.
- her…

05:03.219 --> 05:05.179
- Loud!
- Grandma something!

05:05.263 --> 05:05.930
But--

05:06.014 --> 05:09.434
But she hesitated…

05:09.517 --> 05:11.894
- Normal.
- and wanted to…

05:11.978 --> 05:15.940
- French.
- <i>Allons… allez-vous--</i>

05:16.024 --> 05:18.318
- Whisper.
- <i>Maintenant.</i>

05:18.401 --> 05:19.360
In English.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.862
Now.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.322
What happened to Little Red Riding Hood?

05:22.405 --> 05:24.866
- She died!
- That got me.

05:24.949 --> 05:25.658
Okay.

05:25.742 --> 05:30.538
And then,
big maniacal laughter for the wolf.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.041
You're facing…

05:33.124 --> 05:34.250
the wolf

05:34.751 --> 05:37.378
- turned out to be you…!
- Tears.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.299
All along.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.760
- And scene. Great job, Ken Jeong.
- Thank you.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.636
I don't know what this is, Detective.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.139
But you're going to get your chance
to find out.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.725
I'm reopening Lori's murder investigation.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.560
Yes! Chief! Oh!

05:52.643 --> 05:56.647
And also, you're gonna have to stop living
out of your office, Terry.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.024
We're getting a rodent problem.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.987
- So you've been living out--
- I tell you what,

06:03.071 --> 06:07.158
joke's on her, 'cause I am about
to close on a very sweet condo

06:07.241 --> 06:09.243
down at the Monterey Towers
by the Esplanade.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.662
- Congratulations.
- Yup.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.749
And they got a honor bar
and they got all-nude sundaes.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.710
What does all-nude sundaes mean?

06:17.794 --> 06:22.298
Like just sundaes but without
any of the hot sauce or caramel.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.674
Basically just ice cream.

06:24.258 --> 06:28.054
All right. We are about to investigate
the murder of my former partner Lori.

06:28.137 --> 06:31.015
And if we discover the killer,
we may not just avenge her murder,

06:31.099 --> 06:33.935
we may also unravel a vast conspiracy.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.895
Are you ready
to unravel a vast conspiracy?

06:35.978 --> 06:38.981
Yes, I am. I am ready
to unravel a vast conspiracy.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.900
- When are we ready to do it?
- Now!

06:40.983 --> 06:42.735
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

06:46.280 --> 06:49.200
<i>Lori had died in 2006,</i>
<i>so to solve this case,</i>

06:49.283 --> 06:52.078
<i>Ken and I were going to have</i>
<i>to go back in time.</i>

06:52.161 --> 06:56.040
This is the site where my former partner
Lori was murdered fifteen years ago.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.751
It's crazy that her chalk outline
is still here.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.795
Amber just traced that.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.964
We’re recreating the crime scene.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.091
Right. Right,
I know, of course. Of course.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.717
Hey, welcome. I'm Daz. Welcome.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.677
- Ken. Nice to meet you.
- Don't--

07:08.427 --> 07:10.221
Ken Jeong is my partner, okay?

07:10.304 --> 07:13.975
Not yours. And he and I have
a very special bond that can't be broken.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.686
If you become friends with him,
I'm going to burn down your house.

07:16.769 --> 07:17.603
So.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.606
When paramedics arrived,
they found Lori face up,

07:20.690 --> 07:22.525
two stab wounds in her upper back.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.153
I'm having a tough time
imagining with just the outline.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.321
Daz, you're pretty good
at stabbing people in the back.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.906
Do you wanna pop down there
and take Lori's spot?

07:28.990 --> 07:29.740
Terry!

07:29.824 --> 07:32.785
Well, okay, fine. Ken, you do it.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.038
Just jump down there and take Lori's spot.
Are you on my side or not?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.707
No, I'm on your side.
So just jump down and--

07:37.790 --> 07:41.043
Get in the position
so we can get a full sense of it.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.004
Yup. Get right in there.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.922
Obviously you're not
going to be able to do her clubfoot.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.799
She had a terrible clubfoot, which was

07:46.883 --> 07:48.676
maybe slowly be dying, too.

07:48.759 --> 07:49.594
You know what I mean?

07:52.430 --> 07:54.265
I'm also gonna need you
to take a bunch of notes too,

07:54.348 --> 07:56.267
'cause you gotta keep track
of the evidence. Do you have a notepad?

07:56.350 --> 07:57.226
- Okay.
- Yeah.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.521
All right, so we pulled all of the
evidence from the original crime scene.

08:01.105 --> 08:04.275
CSI recovered this cracked lens

08:04.358 --> 08:07.195
from a pair of eyeglasses.
Strong prescription, right?

08:07.278 --> 08:10.698
Lori didn't wear glasses
so this must have belonged to the killer.

08:10.781 --> 08:15.536
They also recovered a ticket stub
from a James Taylor concert.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.580
Ooh. Oh, wow!

08:17.663 --> 08:20.166
I hate James Taylor.
I hate North Carolina.

08:20.249 --> 08:24.170
Oh, I was… raised in
that state along with James Taylor, but--

08:24.253 --> 08:25.796
Keep dying, Ken.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.008
- What else, Amber?
- If you look right above you,

08:29.091 --> 08:30.593
a four-leaf clover pin.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.719
Ah…

08:31.802 --> 08:32.929
- You see it?
- Yeah.

08:33.012 --> 08:37.016
Is it just me or did this killer
leave a lot of evidence by the way?

08:37.099 --> 08:38.476
- I mean, how did--

08:38.559 --> 08:41.979
How did we not solve this after 15 years?
There's a ton of evidence.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.606
And then, there's the murder weapon.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.566
A professional-grade
hunting knife, yeah.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.652
- There it is.
- Wow. How are we doing on the dying, Ken?

08:47.735 --> 08:49.820
- You dying over here or what?

08:49.904 --> 08:51.280
Okay, that's pretty good.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.158
Oh. And there's this infamous
mystery card.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.286
You know, we found this in Lori's pocket.
Three rectangles cut out.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.163
We've never been able
to figure out what it was.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.207
Wait, hey! Give me this.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.375
What are you doing, Terry?

09:02.458 --> 09:04.126
It's Lori's book, I just--

09:07.046 --> 09:07.922
No.

09:08.923 --> 09:13.010
I knew it. Look at this.
This highlights three names.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.221
Seamus Doyle. Rebecca Hendricks,

09:16.180 --> 09:17.557
and Donald Barton.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.560
Police Commissioner Donald Barton?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.645
I bet they were involved
in whatever Lori was investigating.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.563
Yeah, duh!

09:23.646 --> 09:25.565
These are our three main suspects.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.400
Get up, Ken Jeong.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.111
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.529
- Good job.
- Thank you.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.281
If we're gonna crack this case,

09:34.282 --> 09:36.450
we're gonna need to go deep undercover.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.369
The only question is:

09:39.787 --> 09:42.373
How deep are you willing to go, Ken Jeong?

09:42.456 --> 09:45.001
I'm willing to go very deep, Terry.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.170
I felt like you were so close to saying
you were going to go balls deep.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.715
- I will go balls deep, Terry.
- Oh, God.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.467
That's what I wanted to hear.
Let's go crack this case.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.557
<i>Our first suspect</i>
<i>was Seamus Doyle,</i>

09:59.640 --> 10:02.184
<i>former enforcer for the Irish mob,</i>

10:02.268 --> 10:05.271
<i>current inmate at City State Penitentiary.</i>

10:05.354 --> 10:07.607
- Don't worry, they're fine.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.776
Okay, now listen,
Seamus will never talk to a cop,

10:10.860 --> 10:13.821
but he may confide in a fellow prisoner.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.073
So you're gonna go in there
and be his new cellmate, all right?

10:16.157 --> 10:16.699
Okay.

10:16.782 --> 10:17.992
Now I want you to gain his confidence

10:18.075 --> 10:21.746
and find out everything he knows
about Lori's death before he murders you.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.124
Okay, and do me this favor,
put this earpiece in

10:25.207 --> 10:29.337
and I'm gonna be feeding you lines and
you say exactly what I tell you to say.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.880
Trust me. Okay?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.592
On your feet, Seamus!

10:40.389 --> 10:42.141
Who the hell are you? Are you new?

10:42.224 --> 10:46.520
No. I mean… I'm like a substitute
correctional officer.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.106
Sort of like
a substitute teacher but for… jail.

10:49.190 --> 10:54.028
And this is Victor "Boomboom" Santiago
and he is a bad dude.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.155
Say something really tough, Boomboom.

10:57.948 --> 10:58.908
What's up?

10:59.408 --> 11:00.242
Ugh.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.412
Well, anyway,
I'll just leave you two to it.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.582
Remember, Boomboom,

11:07.083 --> 11:09.418
say everything I tell you to say exactly.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.252
You got it.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.298
- My cell, my rules.
- Yep. Right.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.800
- We're doing pushups.
- Okay.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.009
- Down there.
- Oh, now?

11:17.093 --> 11:17.927
- Let's go.
- Okay.

11:21.764 --> 11:22.807
Down!

11:24.475 --> 11:26.685
<i>I just do it on the weekend,</i>
<i>that's why I'm tired.</i>

11:26.769 --> 11:29.063
- Six.
- I just do it on the weekend, that's why…

11:29.730 --> 11:31.065
- I'm tired.
- Seven.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.860
I can do one more.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.363
Hey, I know a fun game.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.489
Hey, I know a fun game.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.158
<i>Let's talk about some crimes</i>
<i>we've committed.</i>

11:41.242 --> 11:42.952
Let's talk about some crimes
we've committed.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.204
I'll tell you the name
of someone I've murdered…

11:45.287 --> 11:47.706
I'll tell you the name
of someone I've murdered…

11:47.790 --> 11:48.916
<i>And then you tell me</i>
<i>the name of someone you've murdered.</i>

11:48.999 --> 11:50.918
And you tell me the name
of someone you've murdered.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.336
- <i>I'll go first.</i>
- I'll go first.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.089
- <i>I murdered…</i>
- I murdered…

11:55.172 --> 11:57.091
- <i>Santa Claus.</i>
- Santa Claus.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.677
Look, you listen to me, Boomboom!

11:59.760 --> 12:05.349
You leave me be! You leave me alone!
Or you'll get the fire and the rain.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.851
He's not warming up.

12:06.934 --> 12:10.479
<i>Some people are just cold</i>
<i>and unapproachable. I guess that's you.</i>

12:11.939 --> 12:13.983
I'm going to Plan B. I'm coming in.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.569
Oh, you're laughing?
You won't be laughing till this is--

12:17.236 --> 12:18.654
- Come in.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.033
Well, if it isn't the substitute.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.493
Well, I've got to level with you, Seamus,

12:24.577 --> 12:27.079
I'm not a real
substitute corrections officer.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.247
I knew it!

12:28.330 --> 12:31.167
My name is "Fancy" Clancy O'Malley

12:31.250 --> 12:33.919
and this is me best mate Liam Neeson.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.964
Well, that makes much more sense.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.883
And we came here to bust you out.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.801
- Right now?
- That's right.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.346
But we need to ask you some questions
first, just to prove your identity.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.723
- Fire away!
- Here.

12:45.806 --> 12:49.643
Liam, I need you to ask these questions
in your natural Irish lilt. Go ahead.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.603
Uh…

12:50.686 --> 12:52.897
What is your full name, son?

12:52.980 --> 12:57.401
Seamus Flannery O'Connell O'Sullivan
Murphy Doyle. Of the Dublin Doyles.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.945
I'm Irish. I'm from Ireland,
like you, fellas.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.031
What kind of soap do you use?

13:02.114 --> 13:04.283
Irish Spring.

13:04.366 --> 13:08.454
How many people have you murdered?

13:08.537 --> 13:12.249
I have to clarify,
between like killed and murdered,

13:12.333 --> 13:15.419
because I was a sniper in the army so

13:15.503 --> 13:19.590
I did a boatload of totally above board,
legal killings. Have you ever--

13:19.673 --> 13:21.759
Have you ever sniped anyone, Liam Neeson?

13:21.842 --> 13:22.718
I don't think so.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.095
Oh, it's the best.
Literally, the only way to kill.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.890
Liam Neeson,
I think you'd be quite… taken…

13:29.391 --> 13:30.392
by sniping someone.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.977
Ah, you'd be taken, too.

13:35.189 --> 13:39.568
What were you doing
on the night of August 12th, 2006?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.320
Oh, that's-- How the hell am I--

13:41.403 --> 13:45.950
Listen, I don't know what I was doing
but I'm the man for you, all right?

13:46.033 --> 13:48.953
Seriously, I've extorted, I've murdered.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.956
One time, I even terrorized
an entire community

13:52.039 --> 13:53.958
into just abandoning their homes.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.668
They just fled in the night!

13:55.751 --> 13:58.337
Now, no one but Seamus
could have pulled off a thing like that.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.673
You know, so come on,
let's get out of here, boys!

14:01.632 --> 14:03.467
Wait! What's happening?

14:03.551 --> 14:06.136
Thanks for the evidence, Seamus.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.389
Right here.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.848
Is this part of it?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.600
Are you coming back for me?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.435
Are you coming back for me?

14:13.936 --> 14:15.771
They're not coming back for me, are they?

14:16.272 --> 14:18.232
Who are you talking to, Seamus?

14:18.315 --> 14:20.943
<i>Suspect number two</i>
<i>was Rebecca Hendricks.</i>

14:21.026 --> 14:24.405
<i>She was the developer</i>
<i>of the new Monterey Towers condo project,</i>

14:24.488 --> 14:26.031
<i>but had become famous as one of the stars</i>

14:26.115 --> 14:29.159
<i>of the investment competition show</i>
<i>"Den of Snakes".</i>

14:29.243 --> 14:32.329
Okay, listen, I've figured out a way
for us to interrogate Rebecca Hendricks

14:32.413 --> 14:34.748
and make it look like
we're pitching a new product.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.625
Doesn't matter what the product is,
just pitch the hell out of it.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.793
Just pitch it, don't think.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.711
You guys are on.

14:38.794 --> 14:39.920
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:49.346 --> 14:53.851
Hello, snakes. I'm Lincoln Jillcream
and this is my partner Phil Danger.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.686
- Say hi, Phil.
- Hi. Hi, snakes.

14:55.769 --> 15:00.316
We are about to introduce you
to a revolutionary new product.

15:00.816 --> 15:01.859
Check it out.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.364
Introducing Ice Breakerz!

15:07.448 --> 15:08.782
Tell 'em our slogan, Phil.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.952
Okay. Oh, boy, you're shy at a party?

15:12.036 --> 15:18.042
Well, we'll improve it, and then we'll
give you an ice breaker, literally. Enjoy.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.501
Jesus Christ.

15:20.044 --> 15:25.132
Ice Breakerz combines the fun of ice cubes
with the thrill of small talk.

15:25.215 --> 15:29.553
And each cube contains a really fun little
"get to know you" question.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.889
But you can only get to it…

15:31.972 --> 15:33.349
- If you…
- If you…

15:33.432 --> 15:37.102
- Break the ice!
- The… ice!

15:38.729 --> 15:42.441
My kids Taylor and Jimmy would love this,
they love strangers.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.568
They got kidnapped twice
is the downside but…

15:44.652 --> 15:46.153
in general it's a positive. Go ahead.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.780
Would you like to see a demonstration?

15:47.863 --> 15:48.697
Yes, please.

15:48.781 --> 15:53.202
Pick it up, pick it up,
pick it up, pick it up, Phil. And slam it.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.162
<i>Ice Breakerz!</i>

15:57.247 --> 15:58.999
Oh, well, Rebecca.
This first question's for you.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.960
Phil, you want to do the honors, here?

16:01.043 --> 16:02.586
Rebecca!

16:03.921 --> 16:07.091
Where were you
on the night of August 12th, 2006?

16:07.174 --> 16:09.677
Uh… I don't remember, I'm sorry.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.845
Come on. A young Rebecca Hendricks,

16:11.929 --> 16:13.847
you were probably out on the town,
having fun.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.934
My maiden name was O'Leary
so I know my way around a bar…

16:18.352 --> 16:21.438
These guys know.
But, no, no, I'm sorry, I don't recall.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.481
Let's try another.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.775
- Yeah!
- Yes! Let's do another one.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.485
- You'll love this.
- Here we go.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.529
Here we go. All right.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.322
The question!

16:30.406 --> 16:31.740
<i>Ice Breakerz!</i>

16:31.824 --> 16:34.326
- Here we go!
- It's another one for Rebecca.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.244
Rebecca,

16:35.327 --> 16:38.539
have you ever seen
James Taylor in concert?

16:38.622 --> 16:40.499
I'm so confused.
Are all the questions for me?

16:40.582 --> 16:41.458
I don't understand.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.336
Yeah, I think the kids
are gonna love this, but I worry

16:44.420 --> 16:46.171
about limiting your market reach

16:46.255 --> 16:49.049
by only asking questions
of people named Rebecca.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.551
So I'm gonna have to pass.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.386
Okay, hold on, hold on.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.929
We're just starting to have fun.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.265
We're having fun here. We're gonna--

16:56.348 --> 16:57.224
One more.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.976
- One more. Just a limited sample size.
- Here we go.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.437
Break the ice!

17:01.520 --> 17:03.063
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Ice Breakerz!</i>

17:03.147 --> 17:04.189
- Here we go!
- Okay.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.151
Oh…

17:07.234 --> 17:09.194
Rebecca,
what is your eyeglass prescription?

17:09.278 --> 17:12.322
Okay, that seems very intrusive
of a question.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.824
For that reason, I'm gonna have to pass.

17:14.908 --> 17:17.953
That's two passes. The pitch has failed.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.329
- Oh, throw us a bone here.
- Throw us a bone.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.456
Just a couple more questions, maybe.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.416
I don't know if you've ever
watched the show,

17:22.499 --> 17:25.294
but I invest in products,
I don't do handouts, okay?

17:26.086 --> 17:28.630
I earned my money the old-fashioned way.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.092
I inherited a chain
of hunting supply stores, so…

17:32.176 --> 17:33.260
If you'd just help us--

17:33.343 --> 17:34.845
Help? That's all I do is help.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.140
I once took an entire neighborhood
of low-income housing

17:38.223 --> 17:43.270
and flipped it to be high-end
real estate for rich people. Helping!

17:43.353 --> 17:45.314
- Okay. Thank you.
- Great. Thank you, snakes.

17:45.397 --> 17:49.318
I airdropped ten thousand Sodastreams
into Africa

17:49.401 --> 17:51.612
with the press of a button. Helping!

17:53.447 --> 17:55.949
<i>Our investigation</i>
<i>was hitting dead ends left and right.</i>

17:56.033 --> 17:58.410
<i>But the real crisis was still to come…</i>

17:59.495 --> 18:01.288
Oh, it's Monterey Towers calling.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.625
My condo down the Esplanade
must have closed. Here we go.

18:05.125 --> 18:05.876
Go for Terry.

18:05.959 --> 18:09.546
<i>Detective Seattle,</i>
<i>it's Scott McCarley from Monterey Towers.</i>

18:10.047 --> 18:12.049
Scotty Ballgame, what's happening?

18:12.132 --> 18:12.966
<i>I'm sorry, what was that?</i>

18:13.050 --> 18:16.220
It's just a fun nickname
that I made up for you.

18:16.303 --> 18:16.929
<i>I don't enjoy it.</i>

18:17.012 --> 18:21.475
<i>Well, I'm calling you actually because</i>
<i>your application hit a bit of a snag.</i>

18:21.558 --> 18:24.561
<i>None of the people you used</i>
<i>as references are willing to…</i>

18:25.604 --> 18:27.147
<i>well, say anything nice about you.</i>

18:27.648 --> 18:28.982
Fuck!

18:29.650 --> 18:30.984
What?

18:31.068 --> 18:33.487
There are a ton of people
who would vouch for me.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.989
In fact, I'm here right now with…

18:37.533 --> 18:39.493
the President of Finland.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.164
<i>You're with Finnish President</i>
<i>Sauli Niinistö, right now?</i>

18:44.248 --> 18:46.625
That's the guy.
He'd love to vouch for me if--

18:46.708 --> 18:48.961
You've gotta pretend
to be the President of Finland right now.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.130
Say hi, Mr. President.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.298
Hello.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.553
<i>Oh, my God, it is such an honor to speak</i>
<i>with you, Mr. President.</i>

18:57.636 --> 19:00.889
<i>I mean, I am actually,</i>
<i>you know, a Finland buff myself.</i>

19:00.973 --> 19:03.767
<i>Ah, you know,</i>
<i>I spent some time in Hämeenlinna,</i>

19:03.851 --> 19:06.562
<i>a couple days in Kristiinankaupunki.</i>

19:07.062 --> 19:09.398
<i>What's your favorite city?</i>
<i>Aside from Helsinki.</i>

19:09.481 --> 19:14.319
Oh, it's… my favorite place is
kind of a deep cut.

19:14.403 --> 19:18.407
It's a small town called Greensboro.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.534
<i>How do you spell it</i>

19:20.617 --> 19:22.244
<i>with all the dots and so forth?</i>
<i>If you could take me through that?</i>

19:22.327 --> 19:27.416
Oh, uh…
Well, uh, putting me on the spot, it's…

19:28.000 --> 19:30.002
Un, a G…

19:30.085 --> 19:31.170
<i>Yeah. Sure.</i>

19:31.670 --> 19:33.338
<i>Well, it sounds like</i>
<i>you're on the right track on that one.</i>

19:33.422 --> 19:36.592
- <i>I don't need to belabor it, but…</i>

19:36.675 --> 19:38.051
<i>well, I certainly don't want to keep you.</i>

19:38.135 --> 19:40.929
<i>Could you just tell me briefly</i>
<i>why you think Detective Seattle</i>

19:41.013 --> 19:44.224
<i>would be a productive member</i>
<i>of the Monterey community?</i>

19:44.308 --> 19:48.228
In my dealings with him,
he's always been a stand-up guy.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.148
A real friend
to the people of Finland.

19:51.231 --> 19:55.944
He's a real friend
to the people of Finland. He was…

19:56.028 --> 19:58.322
In fact, we have Terry Seattle Day

19:58.405 --> 20:02.492
in which we close the town
of Helsinki and Greensboro.

20:02.576 --> 20:06.788
Don't work. Don't worry.
It's Terry Seattle Day.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.583
<i>Wow. I think we're all set.</i>

20:09.666 --> 20:11.710
<i>You know, a reference from</i>
<i>the President of Finland is all I need.</i>

20:11.793 --> 20:14.296
<i>We're gonna finalize the paperwork</i>
<i>and we'll have it sent over.</i>

20:14.379 --> 20:16.548
- Oh, good. Good.
- Yay! Hurray!

20:16.632 --> 20:17.466
<i>This is great!</i>

20:17.549 --> 20:18.884
Thank you, Scotty Ballgame.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.385
<i>Don't call me--</i>

20:21.803 --> 20:23.972
- Phew. We barely got by. Are you--
- What's--

20:25.182 --> 20:26.642
- Yay.
- You gotta control yourself.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.935
- Sorry.
- You're out of control.

20:28.018 --> 20:28.894
I'm sorry.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.231
<i>With my real estate woes</i>
<i>finally behind me,</i>

20:32.314 --> 20:35.067
<i>Ken and I set our sights</i>
<i>on suspect number three:</i>

20:35.150 --> 20:37.069
<i>Police Commissioner Barton.</i>

20:37.152 --> 20:41.240
<i>And to find out what he knew, I was going</i>
<i>to make the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

20:41.949 --> 20:44.284
<i>Putting Ken Jeong in harm's way.</i>

20:44.368 --> 20:45.285
Can you hear me?

20:45.786 --> 20:46.495
Yes.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.080
Now, according to Barton's schedule,

20:48.580 --> 20:50.749
he's attending
a horse diabetes fundraiser,

20:50.832 --> 20:53.710
so you got plenty of time
to search his office, all right?

20:53.794 --> 20:54.378
Okay.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.171
<i>Now go take a look at his desk.</i>

20:56.255 --> 20:59.007
I got eyes on you the whole time,
don't worry about it.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.969
<i>What do you see</i>
<i>at the desk over there? Anything?</i>

21:03.595 --> 21:04.846
I see glasses.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.934
Glasses. Cracked lens.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.310
All right, check the drawers.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.647
There's a taser.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.401
<i>Look to your left.</i>

21:20.279 --> 21:23.031
- What do you see?
- <i>Stapler.</i>

21:23.115 --> 21:26.118
- And daily planners.
- <i>Perfect.</i>

21:26.201 --> 21:27.911
Look for 2006.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.246
<i>August 12th.</i>

21:29.329 --> 21:30.289
Yes. Yes.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.667
2009, 2008, 2007, 2000…

21:34.167 --> 21:37.587
- There's no 2006. 2001, 2, 3, 4, 5--

21:39.256 --> 21:40.257
<i>Oh, God.</i>

21:40.340 --> 21:42.884
It's Barton. He must have left
the horse diabetes event early.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.344
<i>Go, quick, behind the couch--</i>

21:44.428 --> 21:46.221
- Behind this couch?
- <i>Yes, yes, hide right down there.</i>

21:46.305 --> 21:48.557
<i>Get down, get down, get down. Get down.</i>

21:49.558 --> 21:51.018
Hmm hmm.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.061
<i>He's coming in, he's coming in.</i>
<i>Don't worry.</i>

21:53.603 --> 21:55.605
- <i>Just do exactly what I say.</i>
- Yes.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.025
- <i>Do not deviate.</i>
- I'm sorry, dear. I--

21:58.775 --> 22:00.277
I had to get out of there.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.529
You know I can't handle large crowds.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.034
Why are you getting mad at me?

22:07.743 --> 22:09.328
I'm not the one
who gave the horse diabetes.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.245
<i>Stay down low.</i>

22:10.329 --> 22:13.206
No, no, no, no.
I can't stand it when you cry.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.417
What do you want me to do? Buy the horse?

22:15.500 --> 22:16.960
<i>Yeah, yeah, stay low, stay low.</i>

22:17.044 --> 22:20.547
Sure they'll sell it to me. People will do
anything for the right amount of money.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.382
Okay. Love you too.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.550
<i>Stay low, stay low.</i>

22:24.051 --> 22:26.803
- Great. Now I own a broken horse.
- <i>Okay.</i>

22:26.887 --> 22:28.347
Stay there, stay put. Now look…

22:29.056 --> 22:31.183
<i>His jacket is on the couch.</i>
<i>Can you reach it?</i>

22:32.309 --> 22:34.478
Rifle through the pockets,
see if there's anything in there.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.480
I see a wallet.

22:36.563 --> 22:37.939
A wallet.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.110
Hunting license… Hunting license.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.653
Hunting license?

22:44.237 --> 22:45.572
Okay, he's working at his desk.

22:45.655 --> 22:49.284
You'll be safe as long as
you don't make any loud noises.

22:52.788 --> 22:53.580
Hello?

22:53.663 --> 22:54.831
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

22:55.332 --> 22:56.124
<i>Ken…</i>

22:57.167 --> 22:58.168
<i>what did you do?</i>

22:58.251 --> 22:59.628
I didn't do anything, I swear.

22:59.711 --> 23:03.048
<i>Ken, I'm sorry, it's only you in there,</i>
<i>so I mean, look, if you want me</i>

23:03.131 --> 23:05.550
to play along, fine,
if it's that important to you.

23:08.887 --> 23:09.930
Who's there?

23:10.013 --> 23:11.431
<i>Are you kidding me, Ken Jeong?</i>

23:11.515 --> 23:14.392
<i>That's disgusting.</i>
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

23:14.476 --> 23:16.728
<i>Scoot behind the chairs. Go to the chairs.</i>

23:19.022 --> 23:22.150
<i>Now, listen, I'm coming to save you,</i>
<i>but you need to stall.</i>

23:22.234 --> 23:24.152
Just do and say exactly what I tell you

23:24.236 --> 23:26.029
and you may
just get out of this thing alive.

23:27.614 --> 23:28.990
Reveal yourself!

23:29.491 --> 23:30.450
<i>Stand up.</i>

23:33.036 --> 23:34.538
<i>Sorry about the farts.</i>

23:34.621 --> 23:35.705
Sorry about the farts.

23:35.789 --> 23:39.209
- <i>Don't be alarmed. I'm here to help.</i>
- Don't be alarmed. I'm here to help.

23:39.292 --> 23:42.170
Who are you?
And what are you doing in my office?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.588
<i>I'm you from the future.</i>

23:43.672 --> 23:46.508
I'm you from the future.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.593
You don't look like me.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.595
<i>See, in the future</i>
<i>you can look like whoever you want.</i>

23:50.679 --> 23:53.014
In the future you can look like
whoever you want.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.975
- <i>And you…</i>
- And you…

23:55.058 --> 23:57.477
- <i>Wanted to look like…</i>
- Wanted to look like…

23:57.561 --> 24:00.021
<i>A middle-aged Korean-American doctor.</i>

24:00.105 --> 24:03.066
A middle-aged Korean-American doctor.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.904
You know, I always suspected
something like this could happen.

24:08.405 --> 24:12.159
That's why I came up
with a code word to prove

24:12.242 --> 24:15.996
that future me was really me
and not a terminator.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.874
So I'm going to need you
to give me that code word.

24:18.957 --> 24:22.210
- <i>Gosh, that was so long ago for me.</i>
- Gosh.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.796
That was so long ago--

24:24.880 --> 24:26.673
- <i>For me anyway.</i>
- For me anyway.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.176
Give me the code word.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.761
- <i>I'm just trying to remember--</i>
- I'm just trying to remember.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.305
Code word or you're a terminator.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.015
- <i>Uh, pancakes.</i>
- Pancakes.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.559
- <i>Tommy Tuxedo.</i>
- Tommy Tuxedo.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.811
- <i>Sloparita.</i>
- Sloparita.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.438
- <i>Sludge.</i>
- Sludge!

24:41.521 --> 24:43.231
- <i>Tittynope.</i>
- Tittynope.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.942
- <i>Wetzel's Pretzels.</i>
- Wetzel's Pretzels.

24:46.026 --> 24:50.113
- <i>Tommy Tune.</i>
- Tommy Tune!

24:50.197 --> 24:52.741
- Tommy Tune.
- Tommy Tune!

24:53.241 --> 24:54.618
Detective Seattle?

24:55.744 --> 24:56.912
What the hell is going on here?

24:56.995 --> 25:00.081
That's Senior Detective Seattle.
And what's going on is

25:00.165 --> 25:03.835
you're a suspect in the murder
of my former partner Lori.

25:03.919 --> 25:08.548
You do not waltz in here and accuse
the Police Commissioner of murder.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.508
Tough luck. Just did.

25:11.801 --> 25:12.886
Well, I don't believe in luck,

25:13.386 --> 25:17.057
so you better have evidence
or your career as a detective is over.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.060
I lost nine firearms
in the last six months,

25:20.143 --> 25:23.438
so I'm-- probably…
my career is coming to an end anyway.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.524
- Let's get out of here, Ken Jeong.
- Yeah.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.320
What was the code word by the way?

25:30.946 --> 25:33.073
- It was Tommy Tune.
- It was Tommy Tune!

25:33.156 --> 25:34.658
It was Tommy Tune!

25:35.659 --> 25:36.785
What a showman.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.287
<i>After wrapping up</i>
<i>our investigation,</i>

25:39.371 --> 25:42.332
<i>we lured all three suspects</i>
<i>to Monterey Towers</i>

25:42.415 --> 25:46.294
<i>where Condo President Scott McCarley</i>
<i>was hosting a ribbon-cutting ceremony.</i>

25:47.254 --> 25:52.217
<i>But the only thing that was gonna be cut</i>
<i>was a plea deal for murder.</i>

25:52.300 --> 25:54.970
But anyway, thank you all for coming.
What a treat. You know,

25:55.053 --> 25:57.180
this thing has been
fifteen years in the making

25:57.264 --> 25:59.182
and right at the start of it
I said to myself, I said,

25:59.266 --> 26:02.185
"You know, Scotty Ballgame,
this is your chance to shine."

26:02.269 --> 26:04.354
"You're gonna make a speech
that's gonna blow everyone away."

26:04.437 --> 26:06.064
"You got a decade
and a half to get to it."

26:06.147 --> 26:08.358
And I don't really know
how to explain what happened,

26:08.441 --> 26:10.735
but the time got away from me
and I did not do it.

26:10.819 --> 26:11.778
Stop!

26:12.946 --> 26:18.785
Before we christen this beautiful tower
that I'm about to call home myself,

26:18.868 --> 26:21.788
my partner Ken Jeong and I
have some unfinished business.

26:21.871 --> 26:24.249
Ken? You've gathered all the evidence,

26:24.332 --> 26:25.917
you've looked at the clues.

26:26.501 --> 26:29.296
Now it's time for you to decide
who did it.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.506
Was it Rebecca Hendricks?

26:32.507 --> 26:33.800
Seamus Doyle?

26:34.467 --> 26:36.219
Or Police Commissioner Barton?

26:36.303 --> 26:39.931
I want you to take those novelty scissors
and I want you to hand them to the person

26:40.015 --> 26:42.517
you think killed my former partner Lori.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.268
Go ahead.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.647
Be careful, they're oversize.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.539
Arrest that man for murder.

27:05.665 --> 27:07.500
What is going on here?

27:07.584 --> 27:12.047
Chief, Ken Jeong did it.
He solved Lori's cold case murder.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.965
It was Police Commissioner Barton.

27:14.716 --> 27:19.262
Ken Jeong, why do you think
Police Commissioner Barton was the killer?

27:19.346 --> 27:22.223
Because all the clues add up.

27:22.766 --> 27:23.641
Number one:

27:23.725 --> 27:26.978
The lens
that was cracked at the crime scene.

27:27.062 --> 27:31.441
Commissioner Barton,
in his office, has a pair of glasses.

27:31.524 --> 27:36.738
Number two: The date in question was 2006.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.740
The day planner that was missing

27:38.823 --> 27:43.536
was the year 2006.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.704
And number three:

27:44.788 --> 27:48.500
There was a professional hunting knife
at the scene of the crime.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.293
And out of his wallet,

27:50.377 --> 27:56.174
I managed to get
his professional hunter's license.

27:56.257 --> 28:00.261
So in my mind, I know exactly who this is,

28:00.762 --> 28:04.224
and it is Commissioner Donald Barton.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.309
Ken Jeong,

28:06.393 --> 28:08.478
your undercover work was incredible.

28:09.437 --> 28:12.273
You completely lost yourself
in the characters

28:12.357 --> 28:14.234
and you also completely…

28:17.695 --> 28:18.988
chose the wrong suspect.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.990
Agh!

28:21.074 --> 28:22.158
The killer

28:22.659 --> 28:24.619
was Rebecca Hendricks.

28:24.702 --> 28:25.537
What?

28:26.204 --> 28:27.705
She wore prescription lenses,

28:28.289 --> 28:30.792
she inherited a hunting supply store.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.670
I inherited a chain
of hunting supply stores.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.505
And she had Irish heritage.

28:35.588 --> 28:36.714
My maiden name was O'Leary.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.175
Obviously, it couldn't have been
Commissioner Barton.

28:39.259 --> 28:43.179
He only wore reading glasses,
and he'd never attend a concert

28:43.263 --> 28:44.681
because as he told his wife…

28:44.764 --> 28:46.516
You know I can't handle large crowds.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.184
- Oh…
- Seamus meanwhile

28:48.268 --> 28:50.895
told you
he only liked killing with a rifle.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.523
Oh, it's the best.
Literally, the only way to kill.

28:53.606 --> 28:56.276
And as a sniper,
he had to have perfect eyesight.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.862
But the clue that sealed Rebecca's fate,

28:58.945 --> 29:01.030
the James Taylor concert ticket.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.825
She loved James Taylor.
How do we know?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.244
She named her kids after him.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.246
My kids Taylor and Jimmy would love this.

29:08.329 --> 29:12.751
Rebecca Hendricks was the killer.
Take her into custody.

29:13.376 --> 29:14.252
Ken Jeong…

29:15.712 --> 29:16.504
you're fired.

29:19.257 --> 29:22.051
Wait, before you take her away,
I need to know.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.303
Why'd you kill Lori?

29:23.386 --> 29:25.305
I couldn't let her ruin all this.

29:25.388 --> 29:26.264
This?

29:26.765 --> 29:29.267
This. This is my life's work.

29:29.350 --> 29:31.227
There is no higher calling

29:31.311 --> 29:35.523
than helping rich people
live wherever they want.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.983
Wait a second.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.528
Wait a second, I get it!

29:41.029 --> 29:42.947
Now I know why Lori died.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.409
Fifteen years ago, Rebecca Hendricks

29:46.493 --> 29:48.745
had a dream
to develop Monterey Towers,

29:48.828 --> 29:50.872
but there was one problem,

29:50.955 --> 29:53.374
there was a working-class neighborhood
that was in the way

29:53.458 --> 29:54.709
and she needed to clear them out.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.004
I once took an entire neighborhood
of low-income housing

29:58.087 --> 30:01.758
and flipped it to be high-end
real estate for rich people.

30:01.841 --> 30:06.387
So she enlisted Irish mobster Seamus Doyle

30:06.471 --> 30:08.389
to scare them into selling.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.643
One time, I even terrorized
an entire community

30:11.726 --> 30:15.021
into just abandoning their homes.
They just fled in the night!

30:15.104 --> 30:16.231
And…

30:16.731 --> 30:20.068
she paid off Police Commissioner Barton,

30:20.151 --> 30:24.239
so he would make sure
that the police would look the other way.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.407
People will do anything
for the right amount of money.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.535
Lori had figured it out.

30:28.618 --> 30:31.246
<i>That's why their names</i>
<i>were in her secret notebook.</i>

30:31.329 --> 30:33.414
Rebecca put the knife in Lori's back,

30:33.498 --> 30:35.792
but all three suspects

30:35.875 --> 30:40.380
were part of the conspiracy
that led to Lori's death.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.799
Arrest 'em all.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.553
I'm already in prison.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.221
Then you're going to a bigger one.

30:48.304 --> 30:49.430
Oh, that'll work.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.057
Then you're going to a smaller one.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.193
You did it, Terry.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.945
You avenged Lori's death.

31:04.028 --> 31:08.700
And you uncovered the biggest
corruption scandal in the city's history.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.410
I'm so proud of you.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.372
You did it.

31:17.041 --> 31:21.504
Ken, could you provide a little background
music, something a little sexy,

31:21.588 --> 31:23.256
- a little vibey for me?
- Okay.

31:23.339 --> 31:24.799
I got something I need to say.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.925
Look, Rhonda,

31:26.551 --> 31:30.013
I know I've really made
a mess of things in the last few years.

31:30.513 --> 31:34.392
But this, what's happened here today
has changed everything, and I just--

31:34.893 --> 31:37.353
- Now I know what my future needs to be.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.773
- No.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.610
Chief Rhonda Jenkins-Seattle,

31:43.693 --> 31:45.361
will you do me the honor…

31:46.905 --> 31:48.031
of not divorcing me?

31:48.114 --> 31:49.282
Ken, stop.

31:50.992 --> 31:51.701
Get up.

31:51.784 --> 31:54.704
- You're making a fool of yourself.

31:54.787 --> 31:55.747
Terry, I--

31:55.830 --> 31:58.082
I will always care about you,

31:58.166 --> 31:59.792
but I'm with Daz now.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.254
And we're moving in together, in fact,

32:03.922 --> 32:04.672
right here.

32:04.756 --> 32:08.176
Wait. You're moving
into the Monterey Towers?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.887
Yeah. A unit just opened up today.

32:10.970 --> 32:14.098
Turns out the original applicant somehow
had a negative credit score

32:14.182 --> 32:16.184
and pretended to be friends
with the President of Finland.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.227
- A total nut job.
- Stupid.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.860
And the good news is
I'm moving out of our house,

32:25.944 --> 32:28.947
so once the divorce is finalized,
I'll rent it to you.

32:29.530 --> 32:32.283
Oh, that'd be great.
That sounds very healthy. I appreciate it.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.701
Yes. Yeah.

32:36.412 --> 32:38.081
Yes. Please get out of here soon.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.123
Yup.

32:39.874 --> 32:40.667
Come on.

32:42.585 --> 32:44.837
Aw…

32:45.797 --> 32:46.714
Hey, bud.

32:47.423 --> 32:49.550
Sorry about your life.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.219
Thanks, Amber.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.721
Chief invited me
to her housewarming, so…

32:54.347 --> 32:55.181
Are you gonna-- Yeah, yeah.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.975
- Right in there. Yeah.
- Definitely, yeah, why would you--

32:57.058 --> 32:59.268
Beautiful Monterey Towers
is a gorgeous place to,

32:59.352 --> 33:01.062
not just live, but also party.

33:03.523 --> 33:04.315
Well,

33:05.358 --> 33:06.275
we did it, Ken Jeong.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.860
No, you did it.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.320
No, we did it.

33:09.904 --> 33:12.365
We solved Lori's murder,

33:12.448 --> 33:14.283
and they'll never be able
to take that away from us.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.411
I mean, at least until, you know,

33:16.494 --> 33:19.706
obviously they find all the procedural
mistakes that we made

33:19.789 --> 33:21.791
and they throw it out of court, but…

33:22.917 --> 33:24.210
We'll leave that for another day.

33:24.293 --> 33:27.338
No, I think
there's just one thing left to do.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.924
I think you probably know what it is.

33:30.883 --> 33:33.761
Further investigating getting
Ice Breakerz off the ground.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.221
- Don't you think?
- Yes! Yes!

33:35.304 --> 33:36.806
- It's a heck of an idea.
- I'm on it.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.600
Yeah, we just need to be able
to break the ice cubes a little easier.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.602
- Right.
- Smash them…
