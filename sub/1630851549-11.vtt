WEBVTT

00:12.055 --> 00:15.580
And this is rising to the level
of this office because?

00:15.624 --> 00:17.669
The cop in question

00:17.713 --> 00:19.802
is a 33-year vet

00:19.845 --> 00:21.630
and a decorated captain.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.066
Way to bury the lede.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.067
Taking food and drink
on the arm.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.464
Thing is, she's casting
a wide net,

00:29.507 --> 00:31.596
taking way more
than one person can consume,

00:31.640 --> 00:33.468
and on a regular
weekly basis.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.426
Merchants make the complaint?

00:35.470 --> 00:38.212
No, that's the thing.
Not a merchant, and not someone

00:38.255 --> 00:39.778
identified as
from her command.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.954
Captain Irene Terrell.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.826
Tip came in anonymously
to IAB.

00:43.869 --> 00:46.872
Came to me as a courtesy.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.831
More like as a hot potato.

00:48.874 --> 00:51.138
IAB says the tip
came over the phone.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.444
And this will go out
on the front page.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.185
Well, not if we can help it.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.100
How we gonna help it--
squash it?

00:57.144 --> 00:59.146
You want me have a talk
with her, boss, see what's what?

01:00.538 --> 01:03.063
Well, first find out
what's what, then talk to her.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.194
Put a tail on her
collection points,

01:04.238 --> 01:05.326
see where the goods end up.

01:11.332 --> 01:14.117
What's on your mind, Reagan?

01:14.161 --> 01:16.380
I have a broken window
I'd like to fix.

01:16.424 --> 01:19.035
Of course. Get on the horn with
building maintenance forthwith.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.645
That won't be necessary, boss.

01:20.689 --> 01:23.126
You like to swing the hammer
yourself, Reagan?

01:23.170 --> 01:25.128
Not that kind of broken window.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.394
"Section 203-02.
Tender and return a hand salute

01:30.438 --> 01:32.527
at the precinct front desk
when entering the command."

01:32.570 --> 01:34.311
You're going way back
with this one, Reagan.

01:34.355 --> 01:35.921
Yeah, it hasn't been enforced
for a while.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.314
Since before I came on the job.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.881
I'd like your permission
to reinstate it.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.143
I should've known.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.884
Known what, boss?

01:41.927 --> 01:43.538
That you studying
for the lieutenant's test

01:43.581 --> 01:45.453
was gonna mean some ball busting
for them out there.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.455
Boss, I don't... It's okay.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.239
I don't mean it in a bad way.
It's a compliment.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.154
You're always looking
to do better.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.591
- That's a good thing.
- I'm happy you feel that way.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.463
They're not be happy,
know that going in.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.943
That a yes?
I'm about to start roll call.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.989
Careful what you wish for.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.993
"The dish served
most often at those famous

02:04.036 --> 02:06.691
"Reagan dinners
is hubris

02:06.735 --> 02:09.041
"with a side of pride, vanity,

02:09.085 --> 02:11.087
and pomposity."

02:11.131 --> 02:13.481
"Erin Reagan will never get over

02:13.524 --> 02:15.831
"being passed over
for acting D.A.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.920
She's been crying
in her chardonnay ever since."

02:19.878 --> 02:21.228
What's going on here?

02:22.577 --> 02:25.319
InChargeMan is
slaying the Reagans

02:25.362 --> 02:27.147
on the website <i>
The Square of the Centre.</i>

02:27.190 --> 02:28.409
And who the hell
is InChargeMan?

02:28.452 --> 02:30.498
- Just some guy's username.
- What'd he say?

02:30.541 --> 02:33.153
"When things don't go
Erin Reagan's way,

02:33.196 --> 02:34.502
"her first call
is to Daddy down at One PP.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.634
Nepotism anyone?"

02:36.678 --> 02:37.722
She's gonna freak.

02:37.766 --> 02:38.593
Who's gonna freak?

02:38.636 --> 02:40.725
Hey, Erin.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.643
What's going on?

02:45.687 --> 02:48.385
You know that gossip site, <i>
Square of the Centre?</i>

02:48.429 --> 02:49.604
They're busting your onions.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.780
My onions?

02:51.823 --> 02:54.304
"The only thing bigger
than Erin Reagan's ego

02:54.348 --> 02:56.001
is the size of her feet"?

03:00.658 --> 03:03.226
Happy birthday, Maria.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.446
Like fine wine,
you get better with age.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.404
And more expensive, too.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.058
Nothing a little overtime
won't fix.

03:09.101 --> 03:11.321
This is really nice. Thank you.

03:11.365 --> 03:14.455
You're very welcome.

03:14.498 --> 03:15.586
Nine o'clock.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.810
Jimmy Buffett.

03:21.853 --> 03:24.595
- Sitting at the bar.
- The Margaritaville guy?

03:24.639 --> 03:26.902
Yeah, the Margaritaville guy.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.904
My brother Joe turned me on
to his music when we were kids.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.689
We used to listen to it from
Thanksgiving to St. Paddy's Day.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.691
It would make
the winters breeze by.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.519
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.826
I mean, he's got songs
about stuff besides

03:37.869 --> 03:40.524
boats and booze.
You know, like, uh...

03:40.568 --> 03:41.917
You just got to go
into the deep cuts.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.224
So go over.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.400
I'm not gonna go over there.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.444
It's your birthday dinner.
I'm with you.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.403
If you don't go,
my birthday dinner

03:49.446 --> 03:51.405
is gonna be all about
this Margaritaville guy,

03:51.448 --> 03:53.276
and Chica's not gonna be happy.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.496
- Really?
- Yeah. Go.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.238
- You want to come with?
- No.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.457
- Okay, I'll go fast.
- Okay.

04:06.028 --> 04:08.117
Uh, excuse me,

04:08.160 --> 04:10.119
- Mr. Buffett?
- Oh, hey, how you doing?

04:10.162 --> 04:12.600
Good. I just wanted to say
thanks for all the great music.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.297
- Love your records.
- Thanks. Okay.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.168
I've been to see you live
three times. Jones Beach.

04:16.212 --> 04:19.389
Love Jones Beach. Yeah, well,
thanks for, uh, listening,

04:19.433 --> 04:21.826
and thanks for coming out.
Uh, name?

04:21.870 --> 04:23.001
Uh, Danny.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.351
Okay, Danny.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.917
Well, much appreciation,
brother.

04:25.961 --> 04:26.875
- Yeah. Yeah,
- Have a good night.

04:26.918 --> 04:27.484
- you too.
- Okay, take care.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.228
So?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.882
- Yeah, he was really nice.
- Good.

04:33.925 --> 04:36.188
Called me brother.
Oh. Good.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.408
Yeah. He was real, too,
you know?

04:38.452 --> 04:39.888
The way you hoped he'd be.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.498
Yeah. Like you hoped.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.152
You know what I mean.

04:43.195 --> 04:45.110
Would you like to order
your entrÃ©e?

04:45.154 --> 04:47.156
Yeah, um, first, though,
I want to take care of

04:47.199 --> 04:48.766
Jimmy Buffett's tab.
That's him at the bar.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.115
There.

04:50.159 --> 04:50.899
I thought that was him.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.292
Yeah. He's nice.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.510
I just went over and said hi.

04:53.554 --> 04:54.337
Don't you just love
when that happens?

04:54.381 --> 04:56.513
Yeah.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.559
It's her birthday, by the way.
You ready?

04:58.602 --> 05:00.169
Huh. So, what
can I get for you?

05:26.804 --> 05:28.676
Okay, it's not like
I expected the guy

05:28.719 --> 05:30.330
to only order a cheeseburger

05:30.373 --> 05:31.809
and a beer... Yeah, about that...

05:31.853 --> 05:33.898
but what the hell
is Dover sole?

05:33.942 --> 05:36.161
And $69 a pop
for a piece of fish?

05:36.205 --> 05:39.556
And what about this wine--
what was in it, diamonds?

05:39.600 --> 05:40.688
Maybe. Look, Danny... It's got to be karma.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.516
That's what it is. It's karma.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.648
I-It's payback

05:44.692 --> 05:47.259
from the universe for me leaving
you sitting there alone looking

05:47.303 --> 05:48.652
so beautiful on your
- birthday, right?
- Danny.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.394
- What?
- I googled Buffett when I got up,

05:51.438 --> 05:53.788
and now, of course,
- he's all over my news feed.
- What?

05:53.831 --> 05:56.443
Look, "The Parrotheads
were wet and wild in Austin

05:56.486 --> 05:59.097
"when Jimmy and his band
played an outdoor concert

05:59.141 --> 06:01.012
straight through a rainstorm."When?

06:01.056 --> 06:02.492
Last night.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.146
Well, that's impossible.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.365
He couldn't be in Austin
last night.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.496
He was sitting at the bar...

06:06.540 --> 06:08.324
What couldn't be
is you meeting him

06:08.368 --> 06:09.499
in New York last night.

06:11.283 --> 06:14.765
Son of a bitch. I got scammed.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.506
Okay, well, now I got to find
the fake Buffett

06:16.550 --> 06:18.203
and collar that son of a bitch.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.988
And charge him with what--

06:20.031 --> 06:21.729
conspiracy to defraud
a fish dinner?

06:36.265 --> 06:38.267
Officer Badillo, did you miss
roll call this morning?

06:38.310 --> 06:39.790
No, Sarge.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.270
So, you heard me instruct

06:41.313 --> 06:42.924
the troops that, going forward,

06:42.967 --> 06:44.229
every cop would be expected
to salute the front desk

06:44.273 --> 06:46.231
- upon entering the precinct.
- Yeah, I heard it.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.669
Great, so I don't
have to repeat myself.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.412
Lead with the elbow.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.109
Raise the hand sharply and
bring the salute to your brow.

06:54.152 --> 06:54.762
Don't lower your head
to meet it.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.512
This time, it's just a warning.
Next time, it's a rip.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.561
A rip, a rip.

07:11.605 --> 07:14.390
What?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.479
Do you believe this guy?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.220
Oh, this time it's
just a warning.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.222
You hear him at roll call?

07:20.265 --> 07:21.745
Yeah. We could win
the unit citation.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.268
That's just what I need,
another nerd patch.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.662
He's just doing his job,
you know.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.229
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.449
Sorry, Janko.
Forgot you were there.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.632
She drives the loot to
a veterans hall in Queens.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.851
And a real haul,
trays of ethnic food,

07:40.895 --> 07:43.332
fast food, soda,
beer, liquor,

07:43.375 --> 07:45.290
- sundries.
- Sundries?

07:45.334 --> 07:47.075
Toothpaste, shampoo, you know.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.859
What's she running, a FEMA tent?

07:48.903 --> 07:52.297
She's helping out
military veterans.

07:58.129 --> 08:01.524
I, uh, tinned
the C.O. of the hall.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.353
He says Captain Terrell
makes the drops every Friday,

08:04.396 --> 08:06.877
and it all goes to
the vets on-site, or

08:06.921 --> 08:08.662
gets delivered
to ones with conditions

08:08.705 --> 08:09.663
that keep them shut in at home.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.103
You trying to soften me up?

08:15.146 --> 08:17.061
No, boss, I'm just
reporting my findings.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.542
It's only charity
when it's on your own dime.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.849
Well, that's one way
of looking at it.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.328
I'm afraid I don't have
the luxury

08:23.372 --> 08:24.982
of looking at it
any other way, Sid.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.639
Get Captain Terrell up here.

08:29.683 --> 08:32.207
She's waiting down in my office.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.136
Hell of a record here, Captain.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.529
Thank you, sir.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.227
Certainly nothing in it

08:52.270 --> 08:54.490
that would pave a path
to what you're up to.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.362
I'm up to charity, sir.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.843
It's not charity that
has you here today.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.977
It's taking goods
and services on the arm,

09:03.020 --> 09:05.545
a violation of the patrol guide,
as I'm sure you know.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.376
I'm bending it a little bit.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.813
Not your prerogative.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.208
I myself do not partake
of any of the goods

09:17.252 --> 09:19.907
freely offered for my charity.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.562
I have diabetes and the celiac,

09:22.605 --> 09:24.738
and I don't drink alcohol.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.348
What about the sundries?

09:26.391 --> 09:29.481
I buy my own toiletries,
thank you.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.309
100% goes to the vets.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.834
Well, that is admirable,

09:33.877 --> 09:36.010
but how you get the stuff
is against the rules.

09:37.359 --> 09:40.188
If I may...

09:40.231 --> 09:42.451
When I was 12,

09:42.494 --> 09:44.279
my brother was wounded in Iraq

09:44.322 --> 09:46.063
and ended up six months
in a V.A. hospital

09:46.107 --> 09:48.370
in Hackensack,

09:48.413 --> 09:50.851
which ain't pretty,
let me tell you.

09:50.894 --> 09:54.550
Visiting him there
left me with a lasting scar

09:54.594 --> 09:56.683
and a vow to fulfill...

09:56.726 --> 09:58.162
We're sorry
for your brother, but...

09:58.206 --> 10:00.817
May I finish?

10:00.861 --> 10:02.993
I swore I would do
whatever I could

10:03.037 --> 10:05.779
to make those heroes' lives
a little better,

10:05.822 --> 10:07.650
and that's all I'm doing

10:07.694 --> 10:09.783
with what those merchants

10:09.826 --> 10:11.654
gladly contribute.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.966
I want you to know
you have our respect

10:19.009 --> 10:21.011
for your intentions,

10:21.055 --> 10:24.232
but your methods
have to stop, now, today.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.233
Understood?

10:25.276 --> 10:28.671
And if I do?

10:28.715 --> 10:31.065
You will be given
a command discipline

10:31.108 --> 10:33.981
with a penalty
of warned and admonished.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.809
That is what's on the table.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.645
I'd like to think about it.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.700
Boss?

11:00.485 --> 11:03.750
It's kind of like either

11:03.793 --> 11:06.100
everyone always said no to her,

11:06.143 --> 11:09.016
or nobody ever says no to her.

11:11.061 --> 11:15.065
But you're not everyone
or nobody.

11:15.109 --> 11:18.895
I want to keep
Internal Affairs out of this.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.854
She's valuable on about
five different levels.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.639
So's sticking to the rules.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.685
I know, Sid.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.905
I know.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.781
"Erin Reagan is like

11:34.824 --> 11:38.262
slow on the uptake
but quick to take credit."

11:38.306 --> 11:40.917
You're still obsessing
over this nonsense.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.789
Listen to this one
from InChargeMan.

11:42.832 --> 11:46.140
"We all act like her friend,
laugh at her jokes,

11:46.183 --> 11:49.491
then roll our eyes
as she moves on. Such a loser."

11:49.534 --> 11:51.885
I told you to stop
reading that stuff.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.757
It's a bunch of nonsense
for a bunch nobodies.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.673
Every worker in city government
reads this website.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.066
They're all laughing at me.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.415
- You're out of your mind.
- Are you kidding?

12:00.458 --> 12:02.199
You know how many text messages

12:02.243 --> 12:03.723
I've gotten about this?

12:03.766 --> 12:05.333
Inside baseball horse crap.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.901
It's not horse crap
if you're a baseball player.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.598
- Here, let me help you.
- Eh...

12:11.905 --> 12:14.559
Is this really

12:14.603 --> 12:17.345
how everyone thinks of me?
O-Of my family?

12:17.388 --> 12:19.347
- Not at all.
- It's right there in black and white.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.610
- It's one person's opinion.
- Is it, though?

12:25.222 --> 12:27.398
I mean, how do we know
it's just one person?

12:27.442 --> 12:29.400
Maybe...

12:29.444 --> 12:31.968
they all hate me.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.317
Listen to me,
you're spiraling.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.757
It's him,
I know it's him.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.933
Wallace from Sex Crimes.
He has never liked me.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.458
That's Webster
from Quality of Life,

12:43.501 --> 12:44.546
and he likes you just fine.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.551
Well, you see? I don't even know
my coworkers' names.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.772
This InChargeMan--
e-everything he says is true.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.339
Relax, would you? We're gonna
get to the bottom of this.

12:55.383 --> 12:58.386
- How?
- Look, I got the computer crime squad on the case,

12:58.429 --> 13:01.258
and they're gonna let us know
exactly who InChargeMan is.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.783
I promise.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.790
Did he use his credit card
at the bar last night?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.356
Nope. You paid
his whole tab.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.185
Right, I did. Uh, did he
leave a phone number

13:15.229 --> 13:16.621
or e-mail address when
he made his reservation?

13:16.665 --> 13:18.798
No. He was a walk-in.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.408
Right, 'cause even when
a place is packed

13:20.451 --> 13:22.105
like it was
last night,

13:22.149 --> 13:23.498
a guy like Jimmy Buffett
could just walk right in.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.674
Well, yeah.
Yeah.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.067
I thought you were a fan.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.720
Well, I am a fan of
the real Jimmy Buffett,

13:28.764 --> 13:29.852
but not that grifter.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.375
What do you mean?

13:31.419 --> 13:32.855
Well, that guy
wasn't Jimmy Buffett.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.857
He was a fake.
The real Jimmy Buffett

13:34.901 --> 13:36.511
had a concert in
Texas last night.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.642
But you said he was.

13:37.686 --> 13:38.774
Well, I got duped.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.993
It happens, you know.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.865
What?

13:42.909 --> 13:45.389
I met him after I got off.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.522
Oh.

13:47.565 --> 13:50.090
Well, did he tell you directly
that he was Jimmy Buffett?

13:50.133 --> 13:52.832
Now that I think about it,
he said to just call him Chief.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.399
- Chief.
- Said all his friends do.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.836
And did he scam the
bar you met him at?

13:56.879 --> 13:58.707
Actually, we didn't
meet at a bar.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.535
- Where'd you meet him?
- My apartment.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.190
Oh.

14:03.233 --> 14:06.149
Okay, uh...

14:06.193 --> 14:08.369
well, was anything
missing when he left?

14:08.412 --> 14:10.458
- Not that I noticed.
- He didn't harm you in any way?

14:10.501 --> 14:12.199
Didn't make you do anything
you didn't want to?

14:12.242 --> 14:14.766
He was a perfect gentleman.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.160
I mean, until such time

14:17.204 --> 14:19.989
as gentle wasn't called for,
if you catch my drift.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.557
I do.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.652
What's wrong?

14:30.695 --> 14:33.481
- Nothing.
- Eddie.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.440
Nothing's wrong. Why do you
always think something's wrong?

14:36.484 --> 14:39.356
I don't always. Just when you're
stabbing your mashed potatoes

14:39.400 --> 14:40.836
that you shaped into
a voodoo doll likeness of me.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.578
Okay, that's funny.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.667
Funny enough to earn me
an honest answer?

14:46.711 --> 14:48.931
I just don't understand why

14:48.975 --> 14:50.802
you're doing what you're doing.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.543
I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

14:52.587 --> 14:54.458
that you're not talking about me
eating my dinner peacefully.

14:54.502 --> 14:55.938
You know what I mean.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.374
Why don't you tell me
what you mean.

14:57.418 --> 15:00.377
- You're picking a fight.
- I'm really not.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.639
That's how everyone sees it.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.467
Doesn't make it so.

15:03.511 --> 15:07.384
You're digging up some
obscure rule from 100 years ago.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.820
My philosophy, there's a reason

15:08.864 --> 15:09.734
for every item
in the patrol guide.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.519
Saluting the front desk?

15:11.562 --> 15:13.825
- Mm-hmm.
- That has no relevance today

15:13.869 --> 15:16.393
other than being
super formal for no reason.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.133
Is that what you think?

15:19.396 --> 15:21.094
That's what people think.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.138
Are you one of those people?

15:23.444 --> 15:24.401
No.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.536
I really believe
that the little things

15:28.579 --> 15:30.712
add up to the bigger things,
like winning the unit citation.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.105
Who cares about that?

15:32.148 --> 15:33.323
About us being our best?

15:33.367 --> 15:34.629
I do, and I hope you do, too.

15:34.672 --> 15:37.545
Well, yeah, of course, but...

15:37.588 --> 15:39.199
is it worth it?

15:39.242 --> 15:40.417
Worth what?

15:40.461 --> 15:43.290
Being hated by every single cop

15:43.333 --> 15:44.508
in the house.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.556
It doesn't matter
if they hate me.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.166
Only matters if they follow me.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.394
How do you do it?

16:00.437 --> 16:03.353
No matter what time I get here,
you're here before me.

16:03.397 --> 16:06.182
I was called in early.
Extremely urgent.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.924
Extremely sensitive, I was told.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.752
The D.A.?Nope.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.188
Then who?

16:12.232 --> 16:14.756
I was told not to
speak to anyone about it.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.018
Yeah, but I'm special.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.891
I was called in early fo...

16:19.935 --> 16:22.198
by the C.O.
of Computer Crimes Squad.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.765
Well, that's good.
So, they got something.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.854
Yeah.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.988
They were able track down the
I.P. address for InChargeMan.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.207
- And do we know them?
- Very well.

16:31.251 --> 16:32.992
Oh, man, I'm afraid to ask.
Who is it?

16:34.036 --> 16:35.342
It's you.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.054
He's over there, Detective.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.665
Thank you. Hey, Jimmy!

16:54.709 --> 16:56.537
Wait up.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.975
I said stop! Police.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.150
Stop right there.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.327
Let me see some ID, right now.

17:04.371 --> 17:05.415
Yes, sir.

17:08.549 --> 17:11.291
Dickie Delaney from
Savannah, Georgia.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.335
Yes, sir.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.858
Think you know why

17:13.902 --> 17:14.946
I stopped you, right?

17:14.990 --> 17:16.513
Uh, I think on account

17:16.557 --> 17:17.819
of you think I'm Jimmy Buffett.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.429
I-I get that a lot.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.779
No, no, no, no. On account
of you made me think

17:21.823 --> 17:24.043
you were Jimmy Buffett, which is
identity theft. Not to mention

17:24.086 --> 17:26.132
the fact that you let me
pick up your dinner tab,

17:26.175 --> 17:28.047
which is criminal
impersonation

17:28.090 --> 17:30.440
with intent to defraud.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.138
That's why I'm arresting
you, so turn around,

17:32.181 --> 17:33.226
put your hands
behind your back.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.792
Detective, first,
could I, uh,

17:34.836 --> 17:36.316
reach in my pocket
for a fact sheet?

17:36.359 --> 17:37.969
A what?

17:38.013 --> 17:40.015
Of the actual guidelines
for those charges?

17:42.409 --> 17:45.455
As you can tell,
under the law,

17:45.499 --> 17:46.761
I've neither
promoted, conspired

17:46.804 --> 17:48.806
or coerced, uh, anyone

17:48.850 --> 17:51.113
into thinking
that I was Mr. Buffett.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.854
That's not true.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.769
You thanked me
for liking your music.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.118
I never said it was my music.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.207
Okay, well, you, uh,

17:58.251 --> 18:00.427
you told that waitress
- your name was Chief.
- Yeah.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.558
Your name's not Chief.
It's not even Jimmy Buffett.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.777
It's Dickie Delaney.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.387
A lot of people call me Chief.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.259
Uh, I've been a longtime member

18:06.302 --> 18:08.043
of the Isle of Hope, uh,

18:08.087 --> 18:10.089
Volunteer Fire Department
back home.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.046
You think you're funny,
don't you?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.265
No, sir, no, sir.

18:19.707 --> 18:22.405
I'm sorry for any
inconvenience, Detective,

18:22.449 --> 18:24.407
but have a nice day.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.192
Yeah. You have a nice day, too.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.942
Officer Badillo,
you want to try that again?

18:37.986 --> 18:40.902
Sorry, Sarge.
Didn't see you there.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.033
Shouldn't matter
if you see me.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.426
Right. Of course.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.734
That's a one-day rip.

18:48.257 --> 18:49.432
What?

18:49.476 --> 18:50.825
You heard me.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.219
For that?
You got to be kidding me.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.830
Didn't I give you
a warning yesterday?

18:55.873 --> 18:57.701
Lose a vacation day?

18:57.745 --> 18:59.747
For this?
That's ridiculous.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.618
No. Losing two vacation days
would be ridiculous.

19:01.662 --> 19:02.663
You want to try for that?

19:05.318 --> 19:06.536
No, sir.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.452
Good.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.547
It wasn't me.
You got to know that.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.767
I know that, Anthony.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.508
I would never say those things
about you or your family.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.381
I know, it's just...

19:25.425 --> 19:27.905
It's not easy to fake
an I.P. address,

19:27.949 --> 19:29.733
so someone went to
a lot of trouble

19:29.777 --> 19:31.344
to make it look like
it was you.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.694
Oh, so you do
think it was me.

19:33.737 --> 19:36.087
No. Someone wants me
to think it was you,

19:36.131 --> 19:38.351
and I want to know why.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.482
I don't have a clue.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.571
Do you have any enemies,

19:41.615 --> 19:44.487
anyone that you know that wants
to drive a wedge between us?

19:44.531 --> 19:47.186
My only enemy is
the scale, Reagan.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.188
I'm being serious, Anthony.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.494
Yeah, well, so am I. Look,
I didn't say those things,

19:51.538 --> 19:53.017
I would never
say those things,

19:53.061 --> 19:54.497
and I got no idea
why someone

19:54.541 --> 19:56.760
wants to make it
look like I did.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.372
Just feels like
this is a small part

19:59.415 --> 20:01.939
in a much bigger picture,
you know?

20:01.983 --> 20:04.203
Bigger how?

20:04.246 --> 20:06.161
Like, uh, the other
shoe's about to drop?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.381
I don't know.
Hang on.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.779
What's wrong?

20:15.823 --> 20:18.173
Well, it looks like
that other shoe just dropped.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.523
The <i>Post</i> outed you
as InChargeMan.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.308
How is that even possible?

20:22.351 --> 20:24.048
Only you, me,
and the computer cop know.

20:24.092 --> 20:26.007
I'm telling you,
we are being toyed with.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.878
But by who?

20:27.922 --> 20:29.402
I don't know, but I'm starting
to think it's not your enemies

20:29.445 --> 20:31.317
we need to worry about.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.580
Yours? But there's so many.
We'll never even get...

20:34.885 --> 20:37.148
I didn't mean it that way.

20:37.192 --> 20:40.761
There's only one enemy of mine
savvy enough to do this.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.110
Crawford.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.285
Yeah.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.939
Crawford.

20:44.982 --> 20:48.421
I swear, this guy's
more Boy Scout than cop.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.205
Wonder how he sleeps with
that stick up his butt.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.511
I wonder how Janko
sleeps with him at all.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.687
Seriously, what does
she see in that guy?

20:53.730 --> 20:55.602
He's probably got his sergeant
stripes sewed on to his pajamas.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.867
Um...

20:59.910 --> 21:02.348
w-we're supposed to be back
on the road. It's 1400.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.567
Yeah. I-I was just
coming to get you.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.878
What's her problem?

21:10.921 --> 21:12.096
All right, shut up.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.581
Hey. Wait up.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.061
Sorry about that.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.019
Sorry about what?

21:22.063 --> 21:24.283
We weren't talking about you, if
that's what you were thinking.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.764
- Whatever.
- Look, it's not you, it's him.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.158
You mean Sergeant Reagan,
your superior officer?

21:30.201 --> 21:32.334
Off the record?

21:32.378 --> 21:34.989
He's not winning any friends
here with this saluting thing.

21:35.032 --> 21:38.471
What he'd say, he's your boss.
He's not here to make friends.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.734
- What about you?
- What about me?

21:40.777 --> 21:43.432
What would you say? Or are you
not allowed to have an opinion?

21:43.476 --> 21:47.218
I'm me. He's him.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.351
So, are you the
"stand by your man" type,

21:49.395 --> 21:50.744
or the "go your own way" type?

21:50.787 --> 21:53.486
That's a little personal,
don't you think?

21:53.529 --> 21:54.443
You gonna report me
to Human Resources

21:54.487 --> 21:55.488
for getting real for a minute?

21:55.531 --> 21:58.708
I'm not a rat. Just... watch it.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.407
Listen, truth is...

22:01.450 --> 22:03.452
everyone here likes you.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.149
Including me.

22:05.193 --> 22:08.936
You're a good cop. Good girl.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.590
I'm a good girl?

22:10.633 --> 22:12.809
Forget it.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.159
My point is,

22:15.203 --> 22:18.162
you can only play monkey
in the middle for so long.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.686
Pretty soon, you're gonna
have to choose a side.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.176
At least there's
no voodoo doll on your plate.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.572
- What's going on,
- Jamie?

22:36.616 --> 22:39.836
It-It's like you
read the wrong book.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.926
<i>How to Not Win Friends</i> <i>
and Influence People.</i>

22:42.970 --> 22:43.971
Eddie, I'm...

22:44.014 --> 22:45.189
I know, I know.

22:45.233 --> 22:46.234
You're the boss,
not their friend.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.888
Trite, but true.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.455
I make decisions
based on what I think's best,

22:49.498 --> 22:50.717
not what's gonna be popular,

22:50.760 --> 22:51.848
and then I live
with the consequences.

22:51.892 --> 22:54.111
How very noble of you, Jamie.

22:54.155 --> 22:57.550
Except for you forgot
- one part-- so do I.
- So do you what?

22:57.593 --> 23:00.814
I also have to live with the
consequences of your decisions,

23:00.857 --> 23:02.424
except I don't get a vote
in making them.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.121
What are you talking about?

23:04.165 --> 23:06.123
We're married, Jamie,
so that means that

23:06.167 --> 23:08.517
if everyone at that station
house can't stand you right now,

23:08.561 --> 23:10.345
then they also
can't stand me.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.913
Except, I'm not the one
who decided

23:12.956 --> 23:14.784
to resurrect
some stupid old rule

23:14.828 --> 23:16.699
just to show who's boss.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.484
We've been over this.

23:18.527 --> 23:21.182
Perception is reality,
my friend, and, right now,

23:21.225 --> 23:23.053
everyone thinks you're
Sergeant Stick up the Butt.

23:25.534 --> 23:26.709
Is that what everyone thinks?

23:26.753 --> 23:28.798
Yes, Sergeant Stick Up the Butt.

23:30.626 --> 23:33.368
It's already an extraordinary
courtesy you're extended to her,

23:33.412 --> 23:35.022
but rules are rules, right?

23:35.065 --> 23:37.067
What's got you
flopping around on the dock?

23:37.111 --> 23:37.764
Her.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.637
Yeah, I know.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.422
Yeah, she's one of those cops
you don't want to go up against,

23:43.465 --> 23:45.380
and that's coming from me.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.513
I know who it's coming from,
Sid. I'm right here.

23:47.556 --> 23:48.775
You feel the same way,
don't you?

23:55.085 --> 23:55.999
Captain Terrell.

23:58.567 --> 23:59.568
Let's have her.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.355
Good morning.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.534
And to you, Captain.

24:12.015 --> 24:15.410
As an ex-Marine,
I know you know how that bond

24:15.454 --> 24:18.326
to your fellow brothers
and sisters never leaves you.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.501
I myself never got

24:19.545 --> 24:21.634
to serve, but

24:21.677 --> 24:24.027
I'm honoring
my brother's service by...

24:24.071 --> 24:27.030
By shaking down merchants
with your uniform and your rank.

24:29.903 --> 24:32.296
The Marines still mean a whole
lot of things to me, Captain,

24:32.340 --> 24:33.863
but cheap sentiment
isn't one of them.

24:33.907 --> 24:36.866
I am not shaking down anyone.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.868
I am sharing what I've earned,

24:38.912 --> 24:40.653
the fruits of respect
for my service.

24:40.696 --> 24:44.178
If you'll agree to stop
harvesting your precinct,

24:44.221 --> 24:46.833
I will let this pass
with a "warned and admonished."

24:49.139 --> 24:51.141
So, same as yesterday.

24:51.185 --> 24:54.101
What do you think,
he bargains himself down?

24:54.144 --> 24:56.625
You can cloak this
in any flag you want,

24:56.669 --> 24:58.235
but the fact remains,

24:58.279 --> 25:01.325
it is against our rules
and a burden on merchants.

25:01.369 --> 25:04.154
Who contribute gladly.
Have you even asked them?

25:04.198 --> 25:06.505
Captain, I am not going
any further down

25:06.548 --> 25:07.854
this rabbit hole with you.

25:07.897 --> 25:08.985
Take the offer.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.166
Commissioner, Lieutenant,

25:16.210 --> 25:19.343
I appreciate the courtesy
you've shown me,

25:19.387 --> 25:23.347
but I'm afraid
I cannot accept your offer.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.784
I'll see you in the trial room.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.969
Trial room? Seriously?

25:48.677 --> 25:50.679
Sergeant, one more.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.162
Officer.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.381
Yes, Sergeant.

25:57.425 --> 25:59.470
I think you
forgot something.

25:59.514 --> 26:00.863
You new here?

26:00.907 --> 26:02.430
Yeah.

26:02.473 --> 26:03.692
- Transferred last week.
- From?

26:03.736 --> 26:06.260
Uptown. The 5-1.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.349
Okay, well, down here,
we salute the front desk

26:08.392 --> 26:09.611
when we enter the command,
per the patrol guide.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.047
Okay.

26:13.006 --> 26:15.443
What's your shield number?

26:17.401 --> 26:18.402
Officer.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.708
Without looking at it,

26:19.752 --> 26:21.231
what's your shield number?

26:23.016 --> 26:25.975
What's your shield number? Hey!

26:26.019 --> 26:27.368
Hey, hey, stop that cop!

26:27.411 --> 26:28.804
Stop him!

26:28.848 --> 26:31.764
Hey, hey, you!

26:31.807 --> 26:34.157
Stop him!

26:35.506 --> 26:37.552
Badillo, get his gun.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.466
Got it.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.382
Hands behind
your back.

26:41.425 --> 26:42.557
You got cuffs?

26:42.601 --> 26:45.734
Hey, stay up here.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.650
Mattresses, 50% off

26:48.694 --> 26:51.218
to police officers
and first responders.

26:51.261 --> 26:52.872
Four nights

26:52.915 --> 26:54.874
in Orlando, Florida,
including

26:54.917 --> 26:55.918
airfare for the price

26:55.962 --> 26:58.660
of two nights, same.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.183
Snowblowers,

27:00.227 --> 27:02.751
50% off sticker, same.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.405
I think we get it, Captain.

27:04.448 --> 27:05.928
But, Your Honor,
I still got a couple of d...

27:05.972 --> 27:07.669
I said I think we get it.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.584
So, you see my point?

27:09.628 --> 27:12.456
I see that discounts
are advertised

27:12.500 --> 27:15.634
by select businesses
to our police officers.

27:15.677 --> 27:16.635
Commissioner Reagan?

27:25.469 --> 27:28.429
Your rebuttal?

27:28.472 --> 27:32.520
These merchants are offering
these discounts.

27:32.563 --> 27:34.957
It's a whole different ballgame
when a cop is demanding one.

27:35.001 --> 27:36.089
I don't demand.

27:36.132 --> 27:37.612
The moment you show your shield

27:37.656 --> 27:39.048
and ask the price,

27:39.092 --> 27:40.789
it is an implied demand.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.835
The moment a cop

27:42.878 --> 27:45.620
places his radio
on that lunch counter,

27:45.664 --> 27:46.665
it is an implied demand.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.843
I invite to a good cause.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.845
Your Honor,
this is a two-tiered,

27:52.888 --> 27:55.021
outdated system.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.893
NYPD prohibits its officers

27:57.937 --> 28:00.200
from taking discounts
offered on the job,

28:00.243 --> 28:02.332
and yet discounts are

28:02.376 --> 28:05.074
freely, legally
available

28:05.118 --> 28:07.294
to our officers
each and every day,

28:07.337 --> 28:10.123
so, which is it, Commissioner?

28:11.690 --> 28:14.997
I certainly admit
there are discrepancies,

28:15.041 --> 28:17.130
and I thank Captain Terrell

28:17.173 --> 28:19.480
for pointing that out.

28:19.523 --> 28:22.570
But it is not the prerogative
of any officer

28:22.613 --> 28:24.703
to decide for herself

28:24.746 --> 28:26.748
that a rule is outdated,

28:26.792 --> 28:29.751
and so currently act
as if it had been repealed.

28:29.795 --> 28:33.015
The challenge to a rule or a law

28:33.059 --> 28:35.670
always comes before a change.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.152
A pillar of effective policing
depends on respect for the law

28:39.195 --> 28:41.894
as it stands,

28:41.937 --> 28:43.765
not by personal interpretation.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.335
I have all I need.

28:48.378 --> 28:51.120
I will forward my recommendation

28:51.164 --> 28:53.122
to the
commissioner's office.

28:53.166 --> 28:56.604
But I commend you

28:56.647 --> 28:57.866
for your advocacy.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.129
- That and 50 cents.
- Pardon?

29:00.173 --> 29:02.741
Thank you, Your Honor.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.793
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.403
Well, you're very kind,

29:13.447 --> 29:15.928
but the reason for my visit
is unpleasant.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.712
And not much of
a surprise, either.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.061
You were expecting me?

29:19.105 --> 29:21.585
It's my job.
Please, take a seat.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.113
Well, Garrett,

29:27.156 --> 29:30.246
I know you have seen what
they've been saying about me

29:30.290 --> 29:33.423
on <i>Square of the Centre</i>
and the family.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.817
- Of course.
- And now they've dragged

29:35.861 --> 29:37.427
poor Anthony into it
for no reason.

29:37.471 --> 29:40.387
Not no reason,
very good reason.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.606
To demonstrate that even
your closest friends

29:42.650 --> 29:44.608
have nothing nice
to say about you.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.654
Thank you, Garrett.

29:46.697 --> 29:48.656
Hey, you knew what
you were getting into

29:48.699 --> 29:50.005
when you threw
your hat in the ring.

29:50.049 --> 29:51.746
It's time to thicken that skin.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.357
So, this is about me
running for D.A.

29:54.401 --> 29:55.576
Probably.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.665
And Crawford is behind this--

29:57.708 --> 30:00.189
this underground smear campaign?

30:00.233 --> 30:01.321
Certainly was
my first thought...

30:01.364 --> 30:03.758
Okay. So, what do we do?

30:03.802 --> 30:06.152
...which usually means
it was a dumb idea.

30:06.195 --> 30:07.849
What?

30:07.893 --> 30:09.851
In politics,

30:09.895 --> 30:12.723
if you catch your mind
moving in a certain direction,

30:12.767 --> 30:15.422
it's a pretty safe bet that
someone wants it going that way.

30:15.465 --> 30:18.251
Meaning...

30:18.294 --> 30:20.470
whomever is doing this
wants me to think it's Crawford.

30:20.514 --> 30:23.647
- Exactly.
- So, it's not Crawford?

30:23.691 --> 30:24.779
Or it actually is Crawford.

30:25.693 --> 30:28.609
Or...

30:28.652 --> 30:30.350
it really is Anthony

30:30.393 --> 30:32.700
pretending not to be Anthony

30:32.743 --> 30:34.484
pretending to be Crawford.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.443
Uh, you have me
totally confused.

30:36.486 --> 30:37.574
That's the point.

30:37.618 --> 30:40.229
What am I supposed to do?

30:40.273 --> 30:41.752
- Let me look into it.
- In the meantime,

30:41.796 --> 30:44.190
I do what?

30:44.233 --> 30:46.714
- Absolutely nothing.
- I'm not very good at that.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.890
You think I don't know that?

30:48.934 --> 30:50.413
It's the Reagan Achilles' heel.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.244
Buffett was my first concert.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.898
- You're a Parrothead?
- Mm-hmm.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.813
What's a
Parrothead?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.989
- Yeah, my thought exactly.
- Come on.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.209
Parrotheads are fans
of Jimmy Buffett.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.298
We are a very...

31:05.341 --> 31:06.865
- proud breed.
- Oh!

31:06.908 --> 31:08.518
Whoa.

31:08.562 --> 31:11.130
My first concert was Kiss
at the Garden in 1983.

31:11.173 --> 31:12.261
No, it wasn't.
It was Michael Jackson.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.262
I got you the tickets.

31:13.306 --> 31:14.698
No, actually, Dad,

31:14.742 --> 31:16.744
it was in fact
Kiss at the Garden,

31:16.787 --> 31:19.268
before Michael Jackson, in 1983.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.704
No, that's impossible.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.271
You were, like, 11.

31:22.315 --> 31:23.446
I was actually ten.

31:23.490 --> 31:24.926
You snuck out.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.885
I did. I'm sorry.
Whoa!

31:29.975 --> 31:30.976
My first concert
was 50 Cent.

31:31.019 --> 31:32.673
No, your first concert

31:32.716 --> 31:34.153
was the Rolling Stones.
Your mom and I took you.

31:34.196 --> 31:37.025
No. My first concert
was 50 Cent.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.940
- Uh... he snuck out.
- What?

31:38.984 --> 31:40.855
Whoa!

31:40.899 --> 31:43.379
- See, you reap what you sow.
- Thanks, Dad.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.947
My first concert
was Old Blue Eyes

31:45.991 --> 31:47.688
at the Paramount.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.516
There was a band called
Old Blue Eyes?

31:49.559 --> 31:52.040
- God help him.
- Frank Sinatra.

31:52.084 --> 31:54.173
When singers
actually could sing.

31:54.216 --> 31:57.567
- There you go.
- Springsteen was my first.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.265
The Tracks Tour.
Mom made me bring you

31:59.308 --> 32:01.310
instead of
Gary Iannico.

32:01.354 --> 32:02.659
I heard Gary dumped you
after that.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.313
No, I broke up with him.

32:04.357 --> 32:05.314
That's not what he told me.

32:05.358 --> 32:08.317
<i>Black Album.</i> Jay-Z.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.885
Madison Square Garden.
- I will never forget it.
- Wow.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.061
- I was there.
- No, you weren't.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.454
I was there, at the Garden.
I was there.

32:15.803 --> 32:16.804
So was I.

32:16.847 --> 32:18.588
Yeah, see?

32:19.981 --> 32:23.811
All right. Dad, you're
the only one who hasn't shared.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.552
What was your first concert?
Yeah, come on, Dad.

32:25.595 --> 32:27.293
Well, you're not gonna
believe it.

32:27.336 --> 32:29.338
- I've never been to a concert.
- What?

32:29.382 --> 32:30.818
- You've never been to a concert?
- That's not possible.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.167
Everybody's been to a concert.

32:32.211 --> 32:33.212
- That's not possible.
- Tell us you've never

32:33.255 --> 32:34.169
- been to a concert?
- Nope.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.170
Not the StonesNope.

32:35.214 --> 32:37.825
- or Elton, Zeppelin?
- Nope.

32:37.868 --> 32:39.653
Not even after you married Mom?

32:39.696 --> 32:43.396
Well, you're mother and I
preferred to make our own music.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.354
Oh.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.269
Oh!

32:47.313 --> 32:48.705
No! No.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.492
That's smooth, Dad.
I don't want to know.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.537
Yeah, I thought so.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.020
There was a fake Rod Stewart

32:59.064 --> 33:00.500
making the rounds
a few years back.

33:00.543 --> 33:02.850
- You remember him?
- No.

33:02.893 --> 33:03.982
Walking in and out
of restaurants

33:04.025 --> 33:06.201
and clubs on the arm.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.160
He even got invited
backstage to <i>Hamilton.</i>

33:08.203 --> 33:09.988
Wow. Surprised I didn't
buy him dinner, too.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.728
Come on, Danny.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.208
I'm a detective first grade.

33:13.252 --> 33:15.341
I can't be getting fooled
by some local yokel.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.560
Detective Reagan.
- Yeah.

33:17.604 --> 33:18.909
A Jimmy Buffett's
looking for you?

33:18.953 --> 33:20.128
What?

33:20.172 --> 33:21.956
Detective Reagan?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.610
You again?

33:23.653 --> 33:25.133
You didn't have enough fun
fooling me once?

33:25.177 --> 33:27.222
Listen, I know what
you're thinking.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.572
No, what I'm thinking is
fool me once, shame on me.

33:29.616 --> 33:31.531
Fool me twice, and I'm gonna
throw you out of here

33:31.574 --> 33:32.880
- on your ass.
- So I came prepared.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.316
I got a passport,
driver's license.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.535
Here. Take a look.

33:41.193 --> 33:44.065
It is Jimmy Buffett.
What do you know.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.024
- Yeah, it really is me.
- Wow.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.374
Yeah, but I heard
you had a little problem

33:48.417 --> 33:50.854
with a... a guy
who was pretending to be me.

33:50.898 --> 33:54.510
Yeah. Yeah, he-he fooled me.

33:54.554 --> 33:57.470
You think you could help me
find him again?

33:57.513 --> 34:00.081
What, so you and him
can have a little chat?

34:00.125 --> 34:01.343
Yes, that.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.476
Yeah. I'd love to.

34:10.657 --> 34:13.094
You familiar with a woman
named Ashley Adams?

34:13.138 --> 34:16.663
Uh, no. I don't think so.
Should I be?

34:16.706 --> 34:18.665
- I know her.
- You do?

34:18.708 --> 34:21.059
Yeah, uh, she's one
of the new interns.

34:21.102 --> 34:22.669
Started a couple of months ago.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.888
That's right.
Do you know how she got her job?

34:24.932 --> 34:27.195
Sure.
Uh, through a program we run

34:27.239 --> 34:29.067
with the local colleges.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.243
Poly sci majors,
that kind of thing.

34:31.286 --> 34:34.115
Very good. But she didn't have
to go through all that trouble.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.073
Do you know why?

34:36.683 --> 34:39.555
Because she's the
- mayor's cousin.
- What?

34:39.599 --> 34:41.862
- Seriously?
- And she's not poly sci.

34:41.905 --> 34:44.125
She's computer sci.

34:44.169 --> 34:47.433
Intern by day,
hacker by night, which is why

34:47.476 --> 34:48.956
she was able to self-assign

34:48.999 --> 34:51.132
her IP to your log-ins.

34:51.176 --> 34:53.613
I literally didn't understand
one single word you just said.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.658
I'll cut to the chase.

34:55.702 --> 34:58.444
Neither of you are the target
of this attack.

34:58.487 --> 34:59.967
Okay, well, that's a relief.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.448
My father is.

35:02.491 --> 35:05.668
The negative press swirling
around you two this week,

35:05.712 --> 35:06.539
not to mention
the colorful smearings

35:06.582 --> 35:10.151
of the good Reagan name.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.458
Great stuff for the mayor
to have in his back pocket.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.590
There she is.

35:16.418 --> 35:17.332
Where do you think
- you're going?
- Hey, Anthony.

35:17.376 --> 35:18.333
To send her packing.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.292
Easy, big guy.

35:20.335 --> 35:21.858
We want her
to stay right where she is.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.730
Wait. We do?

35:23.773 --> 35:25.688
Sure we sure do, and
when the time is right,

35:25.732 --> 35:29.127
we'll funnel false information
back to her and the mayor.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.259
Okay. Now I'm interested.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.087
Which is why
she's to be made none the wiser

35:33.131 --> 35:34.523
that we're on to her.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.395
I have to say, Garrett,

35:36.438 --> 35:39.746
I'm a little bit freaked out
and a lot bit impressed.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.618
Your father refuses
to play politics.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.144
It's why he has me.

35:54.543 --> 35:57.633
Hey, it's cranking
out there, huh?

35:57.677 --> 35:59.722
Hey, I'd be happy to take you
to my favorite spot.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.768
Oh, that's okay. Nah,
it's too much trouble.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.378
And plus, who's
gonna run the store?

36:03.422 --> 36:05.163
Oh, man, I'll close up.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.034
Hey, it's 5:00 o'clock
- somewhere, right?
- Yeah.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.470
All over the world, huh?

36:08.514 --> 36:10.211
Hey, Dickie.

36:10.255 --> 36:13.214
Got someone I'd
like you to meet.

36:15.085 --> 36:16.174
Dickie Delaney.

36:16.217 --> 36:18.654
Hi, Jimmy.

36:18.698 --> 36:21.483
Boy, you've really
gone too far this time.

36:21.527 --> 36:24.356
- I'm sorry.
- You tried to scam a cop.

36:24.399 --> 36:25.835
What the hell were you thinking?

36:25.879 --> 36:27.750
I swear, I didn't know
he was a cop. I didn't.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.057
- Tell him.
- It's true. He didn't know.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.538
No excuse. You need
to pay him for the dinner.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.497
That's all I have.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.020
- I don't want it.
- Take it.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.413
I'm good for the rest of it.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.287
And you, take a year off.
Understand?

36:42.330 --> 36:44.637
Yes, Jimmy, I understand.

36:45.986 --> 36:47.379
How's the family?

36:47.422 --> 36:48.989
Oh, they're good.

36:49.032 --> 36:50.643
Yeah, Maria finally

36:50.686 --> 36:52.949
got engaged to that boyfriend.

36:52.993 --> 36:54.429
- About time.
- Yeah.

36:54.473 --> 36:55.517
Give 'em my best.

36:55.561 --> 36:57.040
I will.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.477
Come here, Chief.

37:03.090 --> 37:06.006
And you get your ass back
to Georgia and stay there.

37:06.049 --> 37:07.964
Yes, sir.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.016
Exactly how long
has this been going on?

37:16.059 --> 37:17.974
Mid-'80s, give or take.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.498
And you're okay with it?

37:19.541 --> 37:23.066
Yeah, you know,
couple of days a year,

37:23.110 --> 37:25.373
he can run out, play me,
and have a blast.

37:25.417 --> 37:28.071
The rest of the time,
he lives a very hard life.

37:28.115 --> 37:31.074
For all that I've been given,

37:31.118 --> 37:33.947
if I can't show a little mercy,
who would I be?

37:36.079 --> 37:37.864
You're a good man,
Jimmy Buffett.

37:37.907 --> 37:40.301
Good to see you, Detective.
- Take care.
- You too.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.608
Hey, those vintage boards--
can you show me those?

37:42.651 --> 37:45.045
Oh, this one? Yeah. Right here.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.351
What do you think-- is that me?

37:56.752 --> 37:59.277
You asked for a day to think,
and he gave it.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.104
And I appreciate that.

38:01.148 --> 38:02.497
You asked for your day
in court, and you got it.

38:02.541 --> 38:03.933
Yes.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.848
And the court found for the PC.

38:05.892 --> 38:08.503
Now, we're fresh out
of breaks here, Captain.

38:08.547 --> 38:12.551
Will you cease and desist
in exchange for the warning?

38:15.902 --> 38:18.034
Sid.

38:18.078 --> 38:20.298
Give us the room.

38:20.341 --> 38:22.952
Boss?

38:24.302 --> 38:25.651
Thank you.

38:34.964 --> 38:36.749
Would you please have a seat?

38:46.846 --> 38:48.151
What's the real reason?

38:49.718 --> 38:51.285
I feel it my duty
to give back...

38:51.329 --> 38:53.505
What's the real reason?

38:53.548 --> 38:56.334
I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

38:56.377 --> 38:59.162
It has.

39:04.429 --> 39:05.560
I am a Black woman

39:05.604 --> 39:09.259
whose sense of pride

39:09.303 --> 39:11.740
and purpose in my job
as a cop is shot.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.224
The disrespect and...

39:20.445 --> 39:24.057
...suspicion that
even my friends

39:24.100 --> 39:26.799
and family treat me with
nowadays...

39:28.627 --> 39:30.716
...has ground me down.

39:32.326 --> 39:35.242
I take off my uniform
at the end of my tour,

39:35.285 --> 39:38.724
and I'm still wearing it
in their eyes,

39:38.767 --> 39:40.247
like I'm some kind of traitor.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.774
What I'm able

39:45.818 --> 39:48.560
to do for those vets--

39:48.603 --> 39:51.432
to bring them the stuff

39:51.476 --> 39:53.739
I can get for them
because I wear the uniform--

39:53.782 --> 39:57.612
is the only reason
I can put it on each day.

40:05.533 --> 40:08.406
Please don't say, "I can't
expect you to understand."

40:08.449 --> 40:11.365
Give me that.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.456
Okay.

40:22.289 --> 40:24.465
Your excellent point
in the trial room was

40:24.509 --> 40:27.990
that deep discounts are
widely available to cops.

40:29.818 --> 40:33.300
Discounts, not handouts.

40:33.343 --> 40:35.041
Yes.

40:38.827 --> 40:42.788
So... get discounts.

40:42.831 --> 40:44.833
No more handouts.

40:49.359 --> 40:51.187
How big a discount?

40:56.149 --> 40:58.499
Do I look like
your sales manager?

40:59.587 --> 41:01.937
No, sir.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.901
That is all, Captain.

41:33.795 --> 41:35.536
- Anderson.
- Here, Sarge.

41:38.278 --> 41:40.498
Just a quick minute.

41:40.541 --> 41:42.543
The other day, a police
impersonator came through

41:42.587 --> 41:44.893
those doors and tried to get
access to our locker room.

41:44.937 --> 41:47.505
Turns out this
impersonator

41:47.548 --> 41:49.550
entered the locker rooms
of numerous precincts

41:49.594 --> 41:51.726
throughout the city
and stole two guns.

41:51.770 --> 41:54.773
Needless to say, IAB is swarming
those precincts now.

41:54.816 --> 41:56.252
Thanks to Sergeant Reagan

41:56.296 --> 41:58.777
bringing back the desk salute,

41:58.820 --> 42:00.256
that will not happen here.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.171
Here, he was collared.

42:04.696 --> 42:06.741
As you were.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.485
Officer Badillo.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.532
Here, Sergeant.
