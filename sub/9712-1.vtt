02:53.773 --> 02:58.672
(Han Dynasty, 208 A.D. Summer, Xuchang)

05:06.488 --> 05:10.682
Greetings, Your Majesty

05:21.990 --> 05:24.286
Yesterday, I proposed a decree

05:24.524 --> 05:26.956
for war against Liu Bei and Sun Quan

05:27.258 --> 05:29.746
Has Your Majesty approved the decree?

05:30.158 --> 05:33.090
The Prime Minister has just beaten
back the Northern Wu Wan

05:33.458 --> 05:36.754
Our troops and people need respite

05:36.992 --> 05:38.356
The insurgents Sun and Liu

05:38.659 --> 05:40.591
are ruling their own regimes down South

05:40.859 --> 05:43.256
They plot against Your Majesty's Court

05:43.426 --> 05:45.256
If they are not eliminated in time,

05:45.493 --> 05:50.118
Your Majesty's Han Court
might well be theirs

05:50.427 --> 05:51.654
Prime Minister,

05:51.960 --> 05:53.949
please let me consider this further

05:54.127 --> 05:56.854
How much further must
Your Majesty consider?

05:59.028 --> 06:00.789
I have waged wars across the land

06:00.995 --> 06:02.984
Tens of thousands of soldiers
have perished on the battlefields,

06:03.162 --> 06:06.026
all for the sake of the Great Han Empire

06:06.996 --> 06:09.155
Does Your Majesty
still remember your exile?

06:09.362 --> 06:11.920
Which, if any, among your
Royal relatives rescued You?

06:12.163 --> 06:14.527
I wonder, to this day,

06:14.830 --> 06:17.819
if I had not eliminated the traitors,

06:17.997 --> 06:20.088
how many more would claim
the throne for themselves?

06:29.964 --> 06:30.930
I hereby decree that

06:31.799 --> 06:33.355
Prime Minister Cao Cao

06:33.598 --> 06:35.757
be commissioned as
the Commander of the lmperial Army

06:35.932 --> 06:38.796
and go forth to pacify the South

06:39.166 --> 06:40.996
Thank you, Your Majesty

06:41.166 --> 06:44.621
Senator Kong Rong wishes to speak

06:50.101 --> 06:52.623
Liu Bei is Your Majesty's uncle,

06:52.801 --> 06:55.529
and Sun Quan is the third-generation
heir to the Dukedom of Wu

06:55.702 --> 06:57.930
They have no intent to rebel

06:58.635 --> 07:00.124
Whereas you, Prime Minister,

07:00.302 --> 07:01.427
not only seize all
the powers of the state,

07:01.601 --> 07:03.363
but also intend to
mobilize the entire army

07:03.602 --> 07:06.830
There is no justifiable reason
for your war!

07:07.202 --> 07:09.101
Though you have solemnly vowed yourself

07:09.270 --> 07:11.600
Ioyal to His Majesty's Court,

07:11.769 --> 07:15.793
you will not be able to convince everyone!

07:17.104 --> 07:20.763
The next one to put down a rebellion,
may not be you, Prime Minister,

07:21.104 --> 07:22.502
but Liu Bei

07:22.805 --> 07:24.270
and Sun Quan!

07:25.337 --> 07:26.803
He is the first sacrifice

07:34.106 --> 07:38.129
I thank the Prime Minister for this wine!

07:47.940 --> 07:49.032
(The final year of the Han dynasty)

07:49.207 --> 07:51.197
(Eunuchs and court relatives)
(struggle for power)

07:51.374 --> 07:52.704
(The country falls into chaos)

07:52.874 --> 07:54.431
(Ambitious Cao Cao seizes the moment)

07:54.608 --> 07:56.767
(to coerce the emperor and)
(to control the feudal lords)

07:56.942 --> 07:59.464
(ln the year 208 A.D.,)
(Cao Cao leads his army South)

07:59.642 --> 08:02.336
(to destroy Liu Bei,)
(a distant relative of the Royal Family)

08:02.509 --> 08:04.873
(and Sun Quan, ruler of the Southland)

08:05.643 --> 08:06.768
Begin

08:08.210 --> 08:09.675
Form up!

10:50.129 --> 10:51.890
Watch it

10:58.463 --> 10:59.520
My Lord

11:00.330 --> 11:01.818
Zilong! My Lord

11:01.896 --> 11:02.863
You have returned

11:03.063 --> 11:05.996
Our men made all possible efforts
to hold our ground

11:06.164 --> 11:08.528
until the last minute
before abandoning the town

11:10.531 --> 11:12.690
Luckily, most of the peasants
have already fled

11:12.865 --> 11:13.956
through the valley

11:14.132 --> 11:15.358
My Lord!

11:15.798 --> 11:17.594
The two ladies and the Young Master

11:17.665 --> 11:19.393
are still trapped in the village

11:25.799 --> 11:27.789
My ladies, please be careful

11:28.500 --> 11:30.489
Don't cry

11:48.535 --> 11:49.364
General Zhang

11:49.635 --> 11:52.158
Chief Strategist,
how does the situation look?

11:53.136 --> 11:55.068
Cao Cao's pursuing forces
are greater than anticipated

11:55.236 --> 11:58.294
The cavalry vanguard
will arrive at any moment

11:58.903 --> 12:00.199
The Cao cavalry will use

12:00.370 --> 12:02.233
a wedge formation to attack

12:02.404 --> 12:04.233
We will reflect the light
into their eyes to hold them off

12:04.404 --> 12:06.563
Remember, the refugees need

12:06.738 --> 12:08.966
at least an hour to retreat

12:09.205 --> 12:10.694
We need a thousand more soldiers

12:10.872 --> 12:12.337
for the second line of defense!

12:12.638 --> 12:14.002
Leave it to me

12:23.539 --> 12:24.630
Alright

12:26.173 --> 12:27.469
Forward

12:47.542 --> 12:48.508
My Lord

12:49.009 --> 12:49.804
Zhu-ge Liang,

12:51.043 --> 12:52.202
the peasants are moving slowly

12:52.677 --> 12:55.234
It looks like they will need
at least another four hours

12:56.144 --> 12:57.666
We urgently need
a thousand soldiers from here

12:57.844 --> 12:59.310
Go aid General Zhang

12:59.544 --> 13:01.669
That way Cao Cao cannot chase them

13:01.878 --> 13:04.571
The peasants can be left to themselves

13:04.878 --> 13:06.344
Cao Cao intends to make us surrender

13:06.544 --> 13:07.408
He will not kill them

13:07.711 --> 13:10.576
No! As you can see,

13:11.078 --> 13:13.306
the elderly, the women,
and the children all need our help

13:13.479 --> 13:14.070
My Lord,

13:14.313 --> 13:16.710
these peasants are dragging us down

13:17.079 --> 13:20.170
To succeed, you have to set
aside these trivial matters

13:20.680 --> 13:22.407
These are Han people

13:22.680 --> 13:25.647
They follow us only to escape
from Cao Cao's regime

13:26.147 --> 13:27.807
If we cannot offer protection
to the civilians

13:27.980 --> 13:30.742
then what is the meaning of this war?

13:36.048 --> 13:36.844
I will find Guan Yu

13:37.048 --> 13:38.309
Go and help my Lord

14:01.318 --> 14:03.181
Sister!

14:19.820 --> 14:21.683
Quickly! Bring the horse for My Lady

14:21.854 --> 14:23.979
That looks like Liu Bei's family

14:24.187 --> 14:25.982
Go get the baby!

15:26.428 --> 15:27.416
My Lady!

15:27.995 --> 15:29.483
General Zhao,

15:31.329 --> 15:34.227
he is my Lord's only flesh and blood

15:34.562 --> 15:37.756
He must not fall into enemy's hands!

15:38.096 --> 15:38.993
Rest assured, My Lady

15:39.163 --> 15:42.254
I will take you and
the young Master to my Lord

15:42.497 --> 15:43.895
Let's go! Get on the horse!

16:05.333 --> 16:07.424
My Lady, quickly!

16:18.367 --> 16:19.697
My Lady!

16:22.634 --> 16:23.759
My Lady!

16:27.235 --> 16:28.223
General!

17:10.874 --> 17:12.067
My Lady!

17:40.110 --> 17:41.337
Step apart!

17:42.210 --> 17:44.176
Flip the shields!

18:23.415 --> 18:25.677
Attack!

19:12.455 --> 19:13.681
Let's go!

20:21.530 --> 20:22.961
Bailong!

20:41.198 --> 20:41.926
Chief Strategist,

20:42.231 --> 20:43.788
where are our reinforcements?

22:22.143 --> 22:23.040
Who is that man?

22:23.443 --> 22:25.909
Zhao Zilong of Changshan

22:36.578 --> 22:40.636
Why is there no such a brave
warrior under my command?

22:48.713 --> 22:49.906
General Zhao

22:50.613 --> 22:51.636
Zilong

23:00.748 --> 23:01.645
Retreat!

23:01.815 --> 23:03.281
We can still fight!

23:03.448 --> 23:06.243
Why are we giving up so easily?

23:07.248 --> 23:08.112
We are greatly outnumbered by the enemy

23:08.283 --> 23:09.771
If we can't protect the refugees,

23:09.949 --> 23:11.040
our losses will be worse

23:11.216 --> 23:12.045
Attention!

23:12.216 --> 23:13.614
Protect the refugees!

23:13.783 --> 23:15.408
It's an order!

23:17.983 --> 23:18.778
Brother,

23:19.050 --> 23:20.141
go quickly!

23:20.551 --> 23:23.381
Leave! Protect the refugees!

23:23.651 --> 23:26.049
Zilong, take the Young Master!

23:26.418 --> 23:27.883
Retreat!

23:28.652 --> 23:31.413
Attention, Third Battalion! Hold the line!

23:31.585 --> 23:34.915
Protect the retreating refugees!

23:37.553 --> 23:39.485
Quick!

23:40.553 --> 23:42.542
Charge!

23:48.387 --> 23:51.218
Second battalion, go!

23:51.487 --> 23:54.079
Third battalion, get ready!

24:43.460 --> 24:44.619
My lord

24:48.394 --> 24:52.724
I brought the Young Master back

24:55.461 --> 24:58.223
but the two ladies already...

25:04.329 --> 25:07.420
Zilong, get up...

25:32.432 --> 25:33.489
Prime Minister!

25:33.799 --> 25:35.958
Liu Bei is vulnerable

25:36.233 --> 25:38.665
Look, the cowards have all fled

25:38.967 --> 25:40.796
Dead bodies lie everywhere

25:42.000 --> 25:44.728
The rest ran for their lives!

25:45.301 --> 25:48.631
There is only one man still fighting

26:03.603 --> 26:05.069
Surrender, and your life will be spared!

26:05.236 --> 26:08.169
Kneel down...

26:08.237 --> 26:10.294
Do not be so rude!

26:11.804 --> 26:12.827
General Guan Yu,

26:13.470 --> 26:15.902
a wise man chooses his Lord carefully

26:16.071 --> 26:19.299
Why do you continue to serve Liu Bei?

26:20.271 --> 26:21.498
You still won't kneel!

26:53.843 --> 26:55.002
Protect the Prime Minster! Kill him!

26:55.275 --> 26:57.265
Nobody move!

27:11.978 --> 27:13.739
Prime Minister, why?

27:13.911 --> 27:15.968
If he wanted to kill me,
he already would have

27:16.345 --> 27:19.311
Guan Yu would not stab a man from behind

27:19.478 --> 27:21.842
Liu Bei has lost many battles,

27:22.012 --> 27:24.478
yet so many talented men
remain loyal to him

27:24.645 --> 27:28.772
One day, they will
all serve under my command

27:58.649 --> 28:00.911
I have suffered a lifetime of failures

28:01.317 --> 28:03.783
This isn't the worst one

28:04.283 --> 28:07.011
Cao Cao thinks he holds
the Dynasty's fate in his hands

28:08.351 --> 28:10.180
So long as I live and breathe,

28:10.685 --> 28:12.412
I will fight to end his crimes

28:12.585 --> 28:15.279
against the Han Court

28:16.452 --> 28:19.111
My Lord, I will go to
the state of Wu tonight,

28:19.285 --> 28:21.013
to ask for Sun Quan's support

28:21.419 --> 28:22.578
Sun Quan?

28:23.420 --> 28:25.851
Against Cao Cao?
I wonder if he is strong enough

28:26.119 --> 28:29.142
to fight an enemy as fierce as Cao Cao

28:29.486 --> 28:31.248
Though Sun Quan is young,

28:31.620 --> 28:33.984
he bears great ambitions within

28:34.421 --> 28:36.580
For generations,
the Sun Clan has ruled the South

28:36.754 --> 28:40.516
They have the wealth and strength
to fight Cao Cao

28:40.921 --> 28:44.445
Wu needs us just as much as we need Wu

28:45.021 --> 28:47.419
If our alliance succeeds,
and we defeat Cao Cao,

28:47.589 --> 28:49.351
then Cao Cao will definitely
retreat back North

28:49.622 --> 28:52.783
We can then go West and rebuild our forces

28:53.022 --> 28:54.613
Once we are in control of the West,

28:54.857 --> 28:57.016
Cao Cao will control the North,
and Sun Quan, the South

28:57.190 --> 28:59.486
We will form a power triangle

28:59.691 --> 29:02.418
This division of power is
the only way to stop Cao Cao

29:08.491 --> 29:11.252
My Lord, please rest assured

29:12.658 --> 29:15.352
Are you confident you can convince him?

29:25.193 --> 29:26.853
Eat some more

29:27.527 --> 29:32.517
The road to Wu is long,
and you will need energy

29:42.462 --> 29:44.758
Prime Minister, the surrendered generals,

29:44.829 --> 29:47.091
Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, are here

29:47.629 --> 29:51.426
These two men are untrustworthy

29:51.630 --> 29:54.790
Please be cautious

29:56.496 --> 29:59.691
I trust those who are of use to me

30:09.031 --> 30:11.589
Greetings, Your Highness!

30:12.298 --> 30:13.525
Rise

30:13.932 --> 30:16.091
How many ships and men
have you brought with you?

30:16.466 --> 30:17.931
We have with us
three hundred thousand naval troops

30:18.099 --> 30:19.656
and more than two thousand

30:19.833 --> 30:21.458
battleships and boats of various sizes

30:21.800 --> 30:22.788
Great!

30:24.100 --> 30:26.259
Now we can be

30:26.801 --> 30:29.426
tigers that swim!

30:33.468 --> 30:37.264
Your Highness,
here is our letter of surrender

30:41.802 --> 30:42.961
General Cai,

30:43.769 --> 30:45.962
I see many grammatical errors here

30:46.203 --> 30:47.828
I hope your military strategies

30:48.136 --> 30:50.602
are not as poor as
your command of literature

30:51.170 --> 30:53.261
I hear you have frequent exchanges

30:53.437 --> 30:55.494
with the State of Wu

30:56.604 --> 30:57.592
Your Highness,

30:57.837 --> 30:59.928
I have declared war on Wu many times

31:00.104 --> 31:02.366
These so called exchanges
are limited to only this

31:02.705 --> 31:04.194
No need to explain

31:04.671 --> 31:05.659
What is this?

31:05.838 --> 31:07.498
This is a map of Wu that I drew

31:07.672 --> 31:10.194
taking great pains to be precise

31:14.440 --> 31:15.667
General Cai,

31:16.306 --> 31:18.135
you took great pains indeed

31:19.007 --> 31:20.098
Your Highness,

31:20.174 --> 31:22.367
Liu Bei has fled to Xiakou in defeat

31:22.640 --> 31:24.732
If he eventually joins forces

31:24.807 --> 31:26.831
with Sun Quan's Wu clan,
then I fear that...

31:26.908 --> 31:29.339
Then isn't that in our best interest?

31:29.608 --> 31:31.631
If Sun Quan forms
an alliance with Liu Bei,

31:31.808 --> 31:33.001
then he is harbouring a traitor

31:33.175 --> 31:34.835
and rebelling against the Royal Court,

31:35.108 --> 31:38.166
which justifies our war

31:38.542 --> 31:42.373
Liu Bei, a shoe weaving Royal uncle,

31:42.810 --> 31:44.139
his whole life is a failure

31:44.509 --> 31:45.702
Sun Quan

31:45.877 --> 31:49.674
is a young upstart with no achievements

31:50.777 --> 31:54.869
When a loser join forces with a coward,

31:55.211 --> 31:58.109
what can they accomplish?

32:01.012 --> 32:02.341
Though my Lord is young,

32:02.511 --> 32:03.807
he shows wisdom beyond his years

32:03.979 --> 32:06.002
Speak frankly and don't hold back

32:06.212 --> 32:09.667
The senior advisors
will be your biggest obstacle

32:13.347 --> 32:16.871
You say we can fight this war? We can't!

32:36.349 --> 32:37.610
Hopefully,

32:37.782 --> 32:40.873
he has some good strategies
to use against Cao Cao

32:41.316 --> 32:43.680
This time around,
Cao Cao is determined to fight

32:43.950 --> 32:45.939
We are gravely outnumbered

32:46.317 --> 32:48.442
How could we ever hope to fight this war?

32:49.117 --> 32:51.106
We cannot fight!

33:27.688 --> 33:29.984
Greetings, Your Highness

33:33.155 --> 33:34.451
Mr. Zhu-ge,

33:34.656 --> 33:36.315
I hear that Cao Cao

33:36.489 --> 33:40.149
beat Liu Bei into the mud at Xinye?

33:42.290 --> 33:45.280
The defeat at Xinye was due to
my Lord's noble heart

33:45.457 --> 33:47.515
He did not abandon
the thousands of refugees

33:47.690 --> 33:49.452
who followed our troops
and slowed down our retreat

33:49.658 --> 33:51.453
How large is Cao Cao's army?

33:51.825 --> 33:53.189
A ruthless army of eight hundred thousand

33:53.491 --> 33:55.980
is invading from both land and water

33:57.325 --> 33:59.314
Cao Cao's real target
is not to defeat Liu Bei

33:59.726 --> 34:02.453
but to conquer Wu!

34:06.193 --> 34:08.125
Your Highness governs the vast Southland,

34:08.260 --> 34:09.692
and has many extraordinary
gentlemen in your court

34:09.960 --> 34:12.119
If you are determined
to oppose Cao Cao's invasion,

34:12.293 --> 34:13.453
then please prepare for war!

34:13.726 --> 34:15.751
My Lord! Do not fight!

34:15.828 --> 34:17.487
When the late Duke was still alive,

34:17.561 --> 34:19.857
he always told me

34:19.928 --> 34:21.326
that nothing is more important

34:21.395 --> 34:24.054
than the peace of Wu's people!

34:24.128 --> 34:29.583
We cannot fight, my Lord.

34:29.661 --> 34:31.889
That's right. To surrender is not so bad

34:31.962 --> 34:34.724
For the cowardly, in fact,
the earlier the better

34:35.063 --> 34:37.359
That way everyone can stop worrying

34:37.897 --> 34:38.954
If that is the case,

34:39.397 --> 34:41.989
then why didn't Liu Bei surrender?

34:42.831 --> 34:44.127
Confucius spoke of
giving oneself to justice,

34:44.330 --> 34:45.556
and Mencius spoke of
sacrificing for righteousness

34:45.731 --> 34:47.889
Surrendering is not
a matter of victory or defeat,

34:48.130 --> 34:49.791
but rather one of virtue!

34:50.297 --> 34:51.889
Cao Cao,
the self-proclaimed Prime Minister,

34:52.065 --> 34:55.463
controls the Han Emperor,
and fabricates His Majesty's commands

34:55.665 --> 34:59.723
If he conquers the Southland,
he will surely usurp the throne

34:59.900 --> 35:04.458
If we surrender to Cao Cao,
then we would be aiding a tyrant

35:05.533 --> 35:08.624
Lord Mayor Liu Bei is of
His Majesty's Royal Family

35:08.800 --> 35:10.459
His wisdom is known to the world
and respected by the people

35:10.634 --> 35:12.157
If a noble man, who has been
loyal to the Han court all his life,

35:12.334 --> 35:14.163
fails to succeed, then that is fate

35:14.401 --> 35:16.230
But, how could he surrender to Cao Cao?

35:16.534 --> 35:17.625
That would be

35:17.801 --> 35:20.562
an unbearable shame!

35:28.802 --> 35:31.496
However, it is fine for
Your Highness to surrender

35:31.870 --> 35:35.302
At least, you will be able to
keep your life and possessions

35:35.703 --> 35:36.669
At Cao Cao's mercy,

35:36.837 --> 35:39.395
he may let you remain as
the ruler of the Southland

35:39.571 --> 35:42.901
So why not?

35:44.638 --> 35:47.900
You are saying I am nothing
compared to Liu Bei?

35:49.238 --> 35:51.796
No, Your Highness shows
an outstanding brilliance

35:51.872 --> 35:55.566
greater than that of most
and akin to that of Lord Liu

35:55.972 --> 35:58.404
Your Highness is capable of
ruling the vast Southland

35:58.673 --> 36:02.037
This alone, is a major
advantage over Lord Liu

36:02.573 --> 36:04.472
My Lord, Mister Zhu-ge has come before you

36:04.641 --> 36:06.664
with a plan for fighting Cao Cao

36:06.908 --> 36:09.806
It would not hurt to hear him out

36:13.041 --> 36:14.507
Though my Lord suffered a recent defeat,

36:14.808 --> 36:16.865
we still have Guan Yu,
Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun,

36:17.042 --> 36:19.701
as well as the Navy that they command
with at least ten thousand men

36:20.075 --> 36:22.667
If we join forces with the elite generals
and troops of Wu,

36:22.843 --> 36:25.536
the alliance will strengthen us both

36:26.243 --> 36:27.674
Although Cao Cao's
military outnumbers ours,

36:27.876 --> 36:29.808
more than half of his troops
only just surrendered to him

36:29.976 --> 36:31.374
and are not entirely trustworthy

36:31.644 --> 36:34.371
They have traveled over
one hundred miles every day

36:34.644 --> 36:35.701
They are exhausted

36:35.977 --> 36:39.239
As the saying goes, a worn spear
cannot even penetrate a thin cloth

36:39.511 --> 36:41.568
Moreover, Northerners are not
used to the Southern terrain,

36:41.745 --> 36:42.904
and they have no naval experience

36:43.145 --> 36:46.634
Their abrupt invasion is destined
to result in failure

36:49.579 --> 36:51.408
You make well reasoned points

36:51.979 --> 36:53.172
My Lord,

36:53.979 --> 36:56.377
please do not fall into Zhu-ge's traps!

36:56.580 --> 36:57.671
We cannot justify fighting

36:57.880 --> 37:00.005
against Prime Minister Cao, My Lord!

37:00.380 --> 37:02.074
Our alliance with Liu Bei

37:02.247 --> 37:03.837
will only justify Cao Cao's war

37:04.014 --> 37:05.674
It is better to take Liu Bei captive

37:05.848 --> 37:07.336
and turn him over as a gift to Cao Cao!

37:07.714 --> 37:09.305
No! We shall first fight, then surrender

37:09.547 --> 37:11.979
So that we leave Cao Cao
with a bitter taste

37:12.749 --> 37:14.578
One hundred thousand
against eight hundred thousand!

37:14.882 --> 37:16.507
What kind of a war is this!?

37:16.815 --> 37:18.076
Cowards!

37:18.548 --> 37:20.844
All of you are shameless cowards!

37:21.049 --> 37:22.845
How dare you!

37:23.383 --> 37:25.009
We cannot fight

37:25.383 --> 37:26.315
Your Highness,

37:27.217 --> 37:29.842
I know you have been
concealing your abilities

37:30.150 --> 37:31.844
The sword had been
hidden away for too long

37:32.083 --> 37:34.641
Now is the time to draw the blade

37:41.685 --> 37:43.583
My Lord, this Zhu-ge Liang

37:43.752 --> 37:46.082
is determined to drag us into trouble!

37:46.252 --> 37:47.979
Don't! My Lord!

37:52.220 --> 37:54.152
Speak no more!

37:54.553 --> 37:57.383
I have heard this far too many times!

38:07.022 --> 38:08.851
Let me think it through

38:09.422 --> 38:11.411
Let me think...

38:21.490 --> 38:22.319
How beautiful!

38:22.690 --> 38:24.883
This really is heaven on earth!

38:25.423 --> 38:26.684
Unfortunately,
with the arrival of Cao's regime,

38:26.857 --> 38:29.085
all of this beauty will soon turn to ash

38:29.324 --> 38:32.848
Your words had almost
persuaded his Lordship

38:33.424 --> 38:34.651
For the alliance to happen,

38:34.858 --> 38:37.086
I only need to persuade one other person

38:37.659 --> 38:38.919
Zhou Yu. Viceroy Zhou

38:39.158 --> 38:39.817
Exactly!

38:40.358 --> 38:42.222
The Duke regards him as
his own older brother

38:42.492 --> 38:44.981
The Late Duke had also said,

38:45.259 --> 38:46.884
for internal affairs, seek Zhang Zhao

38:47.059 --> 38:48.582
For foreign affairs, seek Zhou Yu

38:48.760 --> 38:50.192
He is now encamping at Red Cliff

38:50.359 --> 38:51.586
He is the right one to seek

39:29.931 --> 39:31.192
Stop!

39:33.331 --> 39:34.195
Give it to me!

39:34.498 --> 39:36.021
Are you not capable of holding a spear?

39:36.898 --> 39:38.558
There must be power within every stroke!

39:39.565 --> 39:40.861
One more time!

39:42.732 --> 39:43.823
Stab!

39:44.233 --> 39:45.164
Slash!

39:45.233 --> 39:46.256
Strike!

39:46.767 --> 39:47.562
Swing!

39:47.867 --> 39:48.833
Stab!

39:48.900 --> 39:49.991
Slash!

39:50.067 --> 39:51.055
Strike!

39:51.234 --> 39:52.222
Swing!

39:53.567 --> 39:56.761
Mister Zhu-ge, the Viceroy is over there

40:04.869 --> 40:06.698
Form up!

40:17.569 --> 40:19.729
One other wing

40:32.872 --> 40:34.236
The Goose Formation

40:34.406 --> 40:35.666
Not bad

40:37.706 --> 40:40.866
A pity that it is outdated

42:02.215 --> 42:04.443
Give it to me

42:14.417 --> 42:15.576
Your Honor!

42:42.287 --> 42:43.775
You try

44:23.598 --> 44:24.859
Thank you

44:25.966 --> 44:27.796
Your Honor!

44:30.900 --> 44:32.059
My family's water buffalo

44:32.233 --> 44:35.199
was stolen from the fields
near the barracks

44:35.534 --> 44:37.693
Some people saw...

44:52.803 --> 44:55.735
Your Honor, this is Mr. Zhu-ge Liang

44:56.236 --> 44:57.259
Greetings, Viceroy Zhou

44:58.603 --> 44:59.762
Greetings

45:01.303 --> 45:02.599
Why carry a fan on a cold day like this?

45:02.971 --> 45:04.732
It helps me remain calm

45:05.071 --> 45:07.401
It's the one old habit I cannot give up

45:07.971 --> 45:10.904
You do not look like an anxious person

45:12.438 --> 45:13.768
This way

45:18.138 --> 45:19.968
What are you laughing at?

45:20.139 --> 45:22.604
I am not laughing, but appreciating

45:22.906 --> 45:24.236
I am appreciating that these soldiers

45:24.440 --> 45:27.429
know not only how to fight,
but also how to appreciate music

45:28.074 --> 45:29.699
You are knowledgeable in the art of war

45:30.074 --> 45:30.801
Just a little

45:31.040 --> 45:33.768
Yet you say my formations are outdated

45:36.941 --> 45:38.066
No man but you

45:38.241 --> 45:40.207
can hear me from that far away

45:40.741 --> 45:43.708
I have sharp hearing

45:45.042 --> 45:46.268
This way

45:48.276 --> 45:50.208
General Gan, Mister Zhu-ge said

45:50.376 --> 45:51.899
that your formation is outdated

45:52.109 --> 45:55.133
Are you aware that a bad formation
can kill our brothers?

45:55.576 --> 45:58.065
I have never thought of
killing my own brothers

45:58.310 --> 46:01.071
The power of the formations
comes from the heart

46:01.477 --> 46:03.966
There is no such a thing as outdated!

46:04.877 --> 46:05.934
This is...?

46:06.211 --> 46:08.268
This is General Gan Xing

46:08.712 --> 46:10.109
Pardon me, General Gan

46:13.712 --> 46:14.973
General Gan and his army,

46:15.145 --> 46:16.771
used to be the most notorious
pirates in the South

46:16.945 --> 46:17.969
You cannot joke around with him

46:18.412 --> 46:19.571
No problem

46:39.282 --> 46:41.771
I am impressed by
everyone's performance today!

46:46.816 --> 46:48.611
But this elderly gentleman
had his buffalo stolen

46:48.949 --> 46:52.109
in the rice fields near the barracks

46:53.717 --> 46:56.149
Was this done by one of my brothers?

46:56.217 --> 46:58.649
He who did it gave all
our brothers a bad name!

46:58.718 --> 46:59.445
Find him!

46:59.617 --> 47:03.209
Who did this despicable thing?

47:03.285 --> 47:05.080
Lu Su, tell me,

47:05.251 --> 47:06.944
what is the penalty according to law?

47:07.385 --> 47:10.283
By law, the penalty is death!

47:10.618 --> 47:12.481
Step forward. Reveal yourselves

47:12.552 --> 47:14.314
Who did this? Step forward

47:20.287 --> 47:22.082
I have a way to find them

47:22.454 --> 47:25.443
Since the buffalo was stolen
in the rice fields,

47:25.721 --> 47:28.619
then there must be mud
on the shoes of the looters

47:28.787 --> 47:30.481
Am I correct? Yes!

47:38.155 --> 47:40.053
Attention, Gan Xing Company!

47:40.723 --> 47:43.120
Everyone, run to that tree,

47:43.422 --> 47:45.082
around and back

47:45.456 --> 47:47.820
Go! Yes!

47:49.557 --> 47:51.318
Quickly! Follow up!

48:41.563 --> 48:43.961
I did not drag those people out today

48:45.097 --> 48:48.257
because I want to
give them a second chance

48:48.630 --> 48:51.619
The Wu army does not tolerate looting!

48:53.264 --> 48:54.923
What we really need

48:55.298 --> 48:57.594
is to stick together

49:01.665 --> 49:02.961
I have failed

49:03.466 --> 49:05.398
to train my soldiers

49:07.099 --> 49:08.793
I beg your forgiveness

49:12.333 --> 49:14.162
I dare not!

49:14.899 --> 49:16.388
I dare not!

49:31.635 --> 49:34.897
These soldiers are difficult to train

49:43.803 --> 49:47.634
Yet, these soldiers, have great potential

49:51.237 --> 49:53.965
Things like this happen because of
our shortage of supplies

49:54.171 --> 49:56.932
You gave us half of your wealth
to help build this army

49:57.138 --> 49:58.126
Now, supplies are short again

49:58.305 --> 50:01.829
So how about giving up the other half?

50:02.805 --> 50:04.794
Whatever you say is fine by me

50:05.106 --> 50:06.299
Then it's settled

50:06.373 --> 50:08.362
Your Honor!

50:08.439 --> 50:10.462
Bad news!

50:10.840 --> 50:11.828
I told you

50:12.107 --> 50:14.335
this friend is difficult to deal with

50:15.273 --> 50:18.364
It's a breech birth!

50:30.309 --> 50:32.002
Hold this

50:45.344 --> 50:46.809
Luoyue,

50:47.678 --> 50:49.473
hang in there

50:52.778 --> 50:55.336
My Lady! The pony still hasn't...

50:55.412 --> 50:56.605
Be quiet

50:56.679 --> 50:59.839
She can't give birth
with you being so loud

51:15.781 --> 51:17.474
It's coming

51:21.348 --> 51:23.439
Xiao Qiao, what's happening?

51:25.248 --> 51:27.510
A breech birth It will come out soon

51:29.683 --> 51:31.273
Your Honor, for horses...

51:31.449 --> 51:33.642
Be quiet! Breech births are very rare

51:33.950 --> 51:36.814
The pony has not come out for two days

51:38.450 --> 51:39.938
What is happening?

51:41.350 --> 51:43.646
Why is there only one leg?

51:49.118 --> 51:50.812
He can't come out

51:57.452 --> 51:58.782
What should we do?

52:01.020 --> 52:04.248
The other leg is stuck

52:05.487 --> 52:07.476
Simply dragging it out will not work

52:07.854 --> 52:09.081
He is...?

52:09.354 --> 52:10.580
He is Zhu...

52:10.854 --> 52:13.184
He is Zhu-ge Liang, a friend of mine

52:13.488 --> 52:14.977
Step back a little

52:15.254 --> 52:16.811
You are knowledgeable in this too?

52:17.155 --> 52:20.246
A little. I helped cows give birth

52:20.489 --> 52:23.421
Horses should be much the same

52:23.789 --> 52:26.187
Excuse me, let me try

52:54.426 --> 52:56.585
The two front hooves
need to come out together

52:56.960 --> 52:59.153
for a natural birth

53:58.366 --> 54:00.798
The pony does not have a name yet

54:01.267 --> 54:02.789
He was born in the Southland,

54:03.034 --> 54:06.125
so he should have a Southern name

54:08.335 --> 54:09.595
How about Meng Meng?

54:09.968 --> 54:11.491
Meng Meng?

54:16.102 --> 54:18.863
Meng Meng, stand up!

54:21.436 --> 54:22.663
He can't stand up!

54:23.703 --> 54:25.192
Stand up!

54:27.669 --> 54:28.794
Come on!

54:29.370 --> 54:31.359
Stand up!

54:39.471 --> 54:42.801
I hope we can watch him grow each day

54:49.439 --> 54:51.303
I want you to promise me,

54:51.639 --> 54:53.333
when he is grown,

54:53.607 --> 54:56.630
not to make him a warhorse

55:08.442 --> 55:09.373
Viceroy,

55:09.708 --> 55:11.038
Xiao Qiao looks like

55:11.208 --> 55:15.039
she's the proud new mother herself

55:18.610 --> 55:21.303
Viceroy, time is of the essence

55:21.476 --> 55:23.033
War or surrender?

55:24.277 --> 55:25.368
Lu Su,

55:25.643 --> 55:28.303
today we are celebrating.
Let' s not discuss affairs of state

55:28.644 --> 55:29.940
Alright,

55:33.444 --> 55:35.172
Since Mr Zhu-ge is learned in music,

55:35.478 --> 55:37.842
why don' t we play a tune together?

55:38.345 --> 55:40.005
I know only... a little

55:40.211 --> 55:41.438
You know a great deal

55:41.678 --> 55:44.167
You are only hiding it

55:46.312 --> 55:48.540
If you two gentlemen can work together,

55:48.713 --> 55:51.770
then that will be a perfect match

58:53.935 --> 58:54.901
Please

58:54.968 --> 58:56.365
Thank you, madam

58:59.235 --> 59:01.394
Thank you, Mr. Zhu-ge

59:01.736 --> 59:03.702
My husband has not played
his qin for a long time

59:04.003 --> 59:07.901
I, too, have not been
so enervated for a long time

59:12.870 --> 59:13.995
We still haven't discussed the war

59:14.171 --> 59:15.330
How can we leave?

59:15.504 --> 59:17.833
His answer is within his music

59:18.037 --> 59:21.470
He will fight this war

59:25.372 --> 59:27.634
I think you two can be great partners

59:27.906 --> 59:29.462
His music tells me,

59:29.739 --> 59:31.728
that he needs friends

59:33.673 --> 59:36.468
Your music tells me

59:36.840 --> 59:40.829
that you need to fight this war

59:50.208 --> 59:51.799
Prime Minister,

59:52.141 --> 59:54.630
desire and obsession

59:54.809 --> 59:57.207
can also cause of headaches

59:57.575 --> 01:00:02.474
Have you not heard that
desire makes one young!

01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:06.066
This painting must be by Your Highness

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:08.466
Her name is Xiao Qiao

01:00:08.744 --> 01:00:09.970
When I was young,

01:00:10.143 --> 01:00:13.042
her father thought very highly of me

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.238
I saw her only once

01:00:15.811 --> 01:00:19.369
Now, she is the most beautiful
woman in the world

01:00:19.645 --> 01:00:22.134
and married to Zhou Yu

01:00:23.412 --> 01:00:25.708
After I pacify Wu,

01:00:26.312 --> 01:00:28.369
she will be mine

01:00:31.746 --> 01:00:33.042
Gentlemen, you are all here

01:00:33.246 --> 01:00:34.177
Yes, Your Highness!

01:00:34.346 --> 01:00:37.176
General Cai, your ships are well built!

01:00:37.346 --> 01:00:38.869
Thank you, Your Highness

01:00:38.947 --> 01:00:41.243
I have guarded Jingzhou for many years

01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:43.504
With the strength and
power of our current navy,

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:44.874
we will surely defeat Wu

01:00:44.948 --> 01:00:46.436
Great! What?

01:00:46.514 --> 01:00:47.707
The two generals are saying,

01:00:47.881 --> 01:00:50.404
that our ground troops are just for show?

01:00:50.715 --> 01:00:53.875
General Xia-hou, while we Northerners
are great on horseback,

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.413
the Southerners are experts on the water

01:00:56.715 --> 01:00:58.079
T o destroy Wu,

01:00:58.416 --> 01:01:00.678
we will need the hard work
of General Cai and his navy!

01:01:00.883 --> 01:01:02.178
Thank you, Your Highness!

01:01:02.383 --> 01:01:03.406
General Cai,

01:01:03.683 --> 01:01:04.706
What...

01:01:04.983 --> 01:01:07.915
is the best food in the South?

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:11.383
River fish is the best food
in the South, Your Highness

01:01:11.851 --> 01:01:12.817
Then...

01:01:13.385 --> 01:01:15.078
what is the worst thing about the South?

01:01:15.318 --> 01:01:17.147
The weather is the worst

01:01:17.318 --> 01:01:18.511
This is the windy season

01:01:18.819 --> 01:01:21.251
The wind can often be unpredictable

01:01:46.988 --> 01:02:12.054
Victory

01:02:15.659 --> 01:02:17.249
Six dragons lead my chariot

01:02:17.759 --> 01:02:20.816
I will ride the wind
with the greatest speed,

01:02:21.193 --> 01:02:23.489
with all of the feudal lords
under my command,

01:02:23.759 --> 01:02:28.385
to rule the world with one name

01:04:56.111 --> 01:05:00.567
On land and sea, with forces
numbering eight hundred thousand,

01:05:01.344 --> 01:05:04.674
I wish to meet Your Highness
at the hunt for Wu

01:05:05.345 --> 01:05:06.709
This Cao Cao

01:05:06.879 --> 01:05:08.777
really has some nerve

01:05:09.046 --> 01:05:12.570
What does he mean by a hunt for Wu?

01:05:14.046 --> 01:05:17.036
Brother, Smile!

01:05:17.379 --> 01:05:19.369
We will get through this

01:05:21.013 --> 01:05:24.104
They all want you to smile too

01:05:31.682 --> 01:05:33.705
When father was nineteen,

01:05:34.215 --> 01:05:37.613
he was known as the Tiger of the Southland

01:05:38.249 --> 01:05:43.046
When my late brother was twenty-six,
he conquered the Southland

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.375
I am now twenty-six,

01:05:47.783 --> 01:05:50.375
yet I have done nothing!

01:05:53.584 --> 01:05:55.244
It seems that my achievements

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:59.608
will never be able
to be compared to theirs

01:06:00.551 --> 01:06:02.347
No matter how hard I try,

01:06:03.219 --> 01:06:06.845
those old advisors call me worthless

01:06:13.919 --> 01:06:15.112
Brother?

01:06:17.787 --> 01:06:19.014
You came at the right time...

01:06:19.087 --> 01:06:22.110
He will not listen or even smile

01:06:22.287 --> 01:06:23.275
My Lord,

01:06:25.888 --> 01:06:27.013
What is it?

01:06:27.088 --> 01:06:30.680
Cao Cao requests our surrender.
See for yourself

01:06:56.358 --> 01:06:58.586
You have not used this for a long time

01:07:01.558 --> 01:07:02.888
Let's go

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:37.392
He is cunning

01:08:38.203 --> 01:08:40.260
Do you see him?

01:08:41.071 --> 01:08:44.627
This beast is watching us

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:49.102
He is sinister, playing with his prey

01:08:49.571 --> 01:08:51.367
Is he not like Cao Cao?

01:08:52.272 --> 01:08:55.761
Though Cao Cao is Prime Minister,
he is the real traitor,

01:08:56.238 --> 01:08:58.205
always ambushing from the darkness

01:08:58.572 --> 01:09:01.562
In the entire world,
not one person likes him

01:09:02.073 --> 01:09:05.562
Brother, what are you afraid of?

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:10.531
There!

01:09:21.308 --> 01:09:22.274
T o be honest,

01:09:22.542 --> 01:09:24.633
I was prepared for war
with Cao Cao three years ago

01:09:24.975 --> 01:09:26.874
Cao Cao claims to have
an army of eight hundred thousand,

01:09:27.076 --> 01:09:29.702
yet many are surrendered
troops he cannot trust

01:09:30.042 --> 01:09:33.066
He can actually use only
one hundred thousand of them at most

01:09:33.408 --> 01:09:34.705
Our troops have high morale

01:09:35.077 --> 01:09:38.908
We have knowledge of the Yangtze River
and greater naval expertise

01:09:39.544 --> 01:09:41.442
Moreover, Cao Cao has no
justifiable reason for his war

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:42.770
But those senior advisors!

01:09:42.844 --> 01:09:45.276
They are only concerned about
protecting themselves

01:09:45.478 --> 01:09:47.466
You need not listen to them

01:09:49.612 --> 01:09:51.635
Your late brother once told you

01:09:51.912 --> 01:09:54.435
that you are a better administrator,

01:09:54.746 --> 01:09:58.235
but that he is a better commander

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:02.743
That made you lose confidence

01:10:02.946 --> 01:10:06.208
But he only said that
to make you strive to surpass him

01:10:15.151 --> 01:10:16.139
Tiger!

01:10:16.351 --> 01:10:17.510
Help them!

01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:19.510
Go quickly

01:10:20.117 --> 01:10:21.174
Get out of here

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:24.410
Can you walk?

01:10:24.584 --> 01:10:26.073
Are you alright?

01:10:32.852 --> 01:10:35.284
The beast is over there!

01:10:52.488 --> 01:10:53.476
Go

01:10:54.355 --> 01:10:56.617
Do not hesitate anymore

01:13:28.872 --> 01:13:30.702
My decision to fight Cao Cao is final

01:13:31.272 --> 01:13:33.601
If anyone dares mention surrender,

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:38.028
he will end up like this table

01:13:43.904 --> 01:13:44.893
Zhou Yu!

01:13:45.339 --> 01:13:46.327
Cheng Pu!

01:13:46.771 --> 01:13:47.861
Lu Su!

01:13:48.505 --> 01:13:50.595
Ay!

01:13:50.869 --> 01:13:51.858
I hereby appoint

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:02.026
Zhou Yu as the Viceroy in Chief,

01:14:02.372 --> 01:14:03.836
Cheng Pu the Lieutenant Viceroy,

01:14:04.105 --> 01:14:05.969
and Lu Su as the Consulting Commander

01:14:06.337 --> 01:14:08.132
We will form an alliance with Liu Bei,

01:14:08.536 --> 01:14:10.332
to stop Cao Cao's invasion

01:14:10.772 --> 01:14:12.431
Understood!

01:14:42.334 --> 01:14:47.134
It seems that war is inevitable

01:14:48.803 --> 01:14:50.496
We cannot stop Cao Cao's invasion

01:14:50.835 --> 01:14:53.631
But maybe this one
will prevent future wars

01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:59.025
Just as long as there are no more wars

01:15:24.468 --> 01:15:26.490
Isn't this one just like yours?

01:15:27.701 --> 01:15:31.596
You sure know how to
replicate my handwriting

01:15:36.102 --> 01:15:38.192
Do you know why I wrote
so many 'Ping Ans'?

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:39.959
Ping An' means peace!

01:15:40.431 --> 01:15:44.423
So... why so many peaces?

01:15:46.468 --> 01:15:48.329
'Ping An' is

01:15:52.101 --> 01:15:53.258
a name...

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.588
Come,

01:16:14.032 --> 01:16:15.693
what do you hear?

01:16:16.264 --> 01:16:17.822
Listen carefully

01:16:52.964 --> 01:16:54.988
I have heard rumours

01:16:55.531 --> 01:16:57.756
that all the families
are leaving Red Cliff

01:16:58.429 --> 01:16:59.691
When...

01:17:00.129 --> 01:17:02.122
When will I leave?

01:17:02.532 --> 01:17:04.461
I won't let you leave

01:17:04.996 --> 01:17:07.623
I want you to remain by my side

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:36.120
One more time! Hurry!

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:57.790
General Zhao

01:19:01.361 --> 01:19:02.756
Chief Strategist, you are back!

01:19:03.324 --> 01:19:06.315
This is Wu's Viceroy in Chief, Zhou Yu

01:19:08.925 --> 01:19:13.791
Guan! Guan! The ospreys cried

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:18.256
from the sandy river side

01:19:18.326 --> 01:19:22.779
Lovely maiden, modest and fair,

01:19:22.956 --> 01:19:28.117
makes a fine match for the gentleman

01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:30.415
We have no food,
what good is reading a book?

01:19:30.659 --> 01:19:31.919
When you grow up, you will find out

01:19:32.123 --> 01:19:36.147
that reading now will give you food later

01:19:36.658 --> 01:19:39.522
Well, let us read one more time

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:02.576
Great Calligraphy!

01:20:02.856 --> 01:20:04.517
Damn!

01:20:04.823 --> 01:20:06.517
What do you think you are doing!

01:20:12.589 --> 01:20:14.613
I have always admired
General Zhang's famous roar

01:20:14.956 --> 01:20:19.147
To defeat Cao Cao,
we need men with your temper

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.948
This way please, Viceroy

01:20:37.423 --> 01:20:38.978
My Lord, they are here

01:20:39.456 --> 01:20:41.080
Your journey has been hard

01:20:43.523 --> 01:20:45.281
This is Viceroy Zhou Yu,

01:20:45.519 --> 01:20:46.647
Lieutenant Viceroy Cheng Pu,

01:20:46.922 --> 01:20:47.945
Consulting Commander Lu Su,

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.281
and Veteran General Huang Gai

01:20:50.789 --> 01:20:52.274
Greetings, Lord Mayor Liu

01:20:53.288 --> 01:20:54.913
Gentlemen,

01:20:55.322 --> 01:20:57.286
the Duke has helped all of us
by sending these troops

01:20:57.689 --> 01:20:59.949
I am sincerely thankful

01:21:00.123 --> 01:21:01.279
An alliance is a friendship

01:21:01.787 --> 01:21:04.116
Friends, need not be so formal

01:21:04.854 --> 01:21:06.116
Dare I ask, Your Honor,

01:21:06.354 --> 01:21:08.015
how many soldiers
do you have under your command?

01:21:08.254 --> 01:21:09.311
Thirty-thousand

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:11.344
Thirty-thousand...

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.644
thirty-thousand men, are too few

01:21:16.989 --> 01:21:19.146
Our men are too few?

01:21:19.752 --> 01:21:21.686
Your army was defeated by just one blow!

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.283
What battles have you won?

01:21:23.652 --> 01:21:25.677
Speak up. I only worry we might
laugh ourselves to death

01:21:26.018 --> 01:21:27.451
So what?

01:21:27.784 --> 01:21:29.342
What's worse than a defeated army?

01:21:29.587 --> 01:21:30.244
What is wrong with defeat?

01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:32.614
Better to be a loser than a coward

01:21:32.853 --> 01:21:33.946
What are you saying?

01:21:34.285 --> 01:21:35.149
I dare you

01:21:35.351 --> 01:21:36.613
Brother, stop

01:21:37.486 --> 01:21:38.644
Brother!

01:21:41.954 --> 01:21:43.508
We are not building an alliance

01:21:43.684 --> 01:21:45.514
We are making enemies

01:21:45.953 --> 01:21:49.249
Viceroy Zhou, what is your opinion?

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:55.908
At this time of crisis,

01:21:56.152 --> 01:21:58.140
you can still weave straw sandals?

01:21:58.586 --> 01:22:00.413
This has been a habit of mine for years

01:22:00.819 --> 01:22:03.182
We have walked a long way
wearing these shoes

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:04.813
Whenever our shoes are worn out,

01:22:05.152 --> 01:22:07.811
Big Brother weaves new ones
with his own hands

01:22:07.984 --> 01:22:09.007
Exactly

01:22:18.349 --> 01:22:20.319
It really is strong

01:22:26.848 --> 01:22:29.579
I am surprised that
such weak strands of grass,

01:22:30.084 --> 01:22:32.608
can become so strong
after you weaved them together

01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:44.014
You have a noble Lord, and brave generals

01:22:44.283 --> 01:22:45.682
Generals Guan, Zhang and Zhao

01:22:45.751 --> 01:22:47.044
are all invincible warriors
on the battlefield

01:22:47.584 --> 01:22:50.911
An army high in spirits can fight
an enemy ten times its size

01:22:52.484 --> 01:22:55.448
We sons of Wu, must protect our homeland

01:22:55.649 --> 01:22:57.776
We will also do our best

01:22:57.984 --> 01:22:59.743
I have only one dream

01:22:59.949 --> 01:23:02.312
A dream for all;

01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:05.672
that is for all of us to unite!

01:23:07.183 --> 01:23:09.909
United, no one can pull us apart!

01:23:27.782 --> 01:23:28.906
I'm here!

01:23:30.147 --> 01:23:31.241
Why are you here?

01:23:31.317 --> 01:23:32.304
To go to war!

01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:34.673
War?

01:23:35.015 --> 01:23:37.810
War is no joking matter!

01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:42.243
You think that I'm here to joke around?

01:23:42.314 --> 01:23:43.440
A woman should share the responsibility

01:23:43.614 --> 01:23:44.944
for the rise and fall of the Kingdom

01:23:45.447 --> 01:23:47.437
So should a horse!

01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:49.608
Don't go! Come back!

01:23:50.512 --> 01:23:51.605
Don't be like my brother!

01:23:51.781 --> 01:23:52.938
Talk to me!

01:23:53.314 --> 01:23:54.404
She is...?

01:23:54.481 --> 01:23:57.346
Our Princess, Sun Shang Xiang

01:23:59.313 --> 01:24:02.746
Princess, have you ever been to war?

01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:05.808
There is a first time for everything!

01:24:06.014 --> 01:24:07.946
After I fought my first war,

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:10.077
I never wished for a second

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:12.773
I think, if she encounters any Cao troops,

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:16.468
her hands will tremble with fear,
as if she were waving

01:24:16.946 --> 01:24:17.878
Princess,

01:24:17.947 --> 01:24:21.673
I see you better off at home,
making your flower weavings

01:24:26.914 --> 01:24:28.434
She seem a very ambitious young lady

01:24:28.946 --> 01:24:32.810
She is a tomboy. She likes fighting

01:24:33.511 --> 01:24:36.342
Her maids are all fully armed

01:24:37.677 --> 01:24:39.646
Who would dare marry her?

01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:42.108
What are you doing?

01:25:12.012 --> 01:25:13.736
What did you say to my horse!

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:17.105
I told him that his rider

01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:19.774
is a scoundrel!

01:25:20.846 --> 01:25:22.775
Get up!

01:25:24.843 --> 01:25:26.740
Don't pull so hard!

01:25:42.242 --> 01:25:42.834
Hey!

01:25:43.409 --> 01:25:45.170
Hey!

01:27:06.006 --> 01:27:07.304
Turn towards me

01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:21.902
Prime Minister!

01:27:22.304 --> 01:27:23.238
Prime Minister,

01:27:23.307 --> 01:27:25.795
a messenger from Wu has arrived!

01:27:29.238 --> 01:27:30.826
Bring him forth! Yes sir!

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.332
This way please

01:27:44.138 --> 01:27:45.999
Did Sun Quan receive my letter?

01:27:46.637 --> 01:27:47.624
He did

01:27:47.703 --> 01:27:49.000
What is his reply?

01:28:21.136 --> 01:28:23.501
This page is blank.
What is the meaning of this?

01:28:23.803 --> 01:28:25.292
They intend to fight,

01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:29.933
so they did not bother to write a reply

01:28:30.337 --> 01:28:32.768
Have him, beheaded!

01:28:33.304 --> 01:28:34.361
Prime Minister,

01:28:34.437 --> 01:28:37.061
Liu Bei must have already
formed an alliance with Wu,

01:28:37.301 --> 01:28:39.893
brazenly opposing the empire

01:28:47.737 --> 01:28:50.894
Who will command their alliance?

01:28:51.071 --> 01:28:54.092
Prime Minister, I guess it will be Zhou Yu

01:28:54.502 --> 01:28:57.332
Zhou Yu is known not for his
military abilities, but his musical talent

01:28:57.502 --> 01:28:59.493
How can such a man lead an army?

01:28:59.736 --> 01:29:01.757
Prime Minister, for years,

01:29:01.934 --> 01:29:03.902
Zhou Yu has remained our toughest opponent

01:29:04.069 --> 01:29:05.295
Indeed, he is a skilled musician,

01:29:05.469 --> 01:29:07.231
but he is an even better naval commander

01:29:07.569 --> 01:29:09.160
We have suffered considerable
losses against him

01:29:09.336 --> 01:29:11.631
Please do not underestimate him

01:29:13.434 --> 01:29:14.663
You sure do

01:29:14.968 --> 01:29:16.935
give him a lot of credit!

01:29:19.333 --> 01:29:20.322
Prime Minister,

01:29:20.736 --> 01:29:22.563
there is one other man
we cannot underestimate!

01:29:22.834 --> 01:29:24.765
Who is it? That is

01:29:25.401 --> 01:29:26.990
Zhu-ge Liang

01:30:11.832 --> 01:30:15.664
To the first hero
who sacrificed his life for Wu

01:30:40.099 --> 01:30:41.827
In the battle of Guandu,

01:30:42.231 --> 01:30:44.888
Cao Cao cut off the noses of
a thousand prisoners of war

01:30:45.999 --> 01:30:47.485
He boxed and returned those noses,

01:30:47.665 --> 01:30:50.155
instantly crushing his opponent's morale

01:30:50.232 --> 01:30:51.255
Today,

01:30:51.330 --> 01:30:53.991
he beheaded a man of Wu

01:30:54.298 --> 01:30:57.262
to crush our morale!

01:30:58.931 --> 01:31:00.451
But, we men of Wu are not cowards,

01:31:00.828 --> 01:31:02.591
and we are not afraid

01:31:03.065 --> 01:31:04.758
I have been waiting for this day!

01:31:06.266 --> 01:31:07.322
I'm here!

01:31:07.899 --> 01:31:08.828
What a commotion!

01:31:08.895 --> 01:31:11.454
I won't miss tomorrow's battle

01:31:16.828 --> 01:31:17.816
Zilong,

01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:20.624
have there been any problems
with the allied training?

01:31:20.964 --> 01:31:22.226
The two armies have different
codes of conduct,

01:31:22.496 --> 01:31:25.485
so at the start,
there were a few minor conflicts

01:31:25.794 --> 01:31:28.285
But, rest assured, I am training them well

01:31:45.395 --> 01:31:47.916
Zhou Yu likes naval battles?

01:31:48.431 --> 01:31:49.918
Generals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun,

01:31:50.164 --> 01:31:51.490
I know you cannot wait any longer!

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.620
Very well,

01:31:52.928 --> 01:31:55.895
you two are to command our navy
to set sail down south

01:31:56.462 --> 01:31:58.089
Cai Mao leads a strong navy

01:31:58.295 --> 01:32:00.384
The water current and wind
are all to their advantage

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.386
So, we can launch our naval invasion

01:32:02.461 --> 01:32:04.256
Prime Minister, when shall we set out?

01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:05.759
Tomorrow, before dawn

01:32:06.096 --> 01:32:07.890
He cannot wait.
He will launch the attack tonight

01:32:08.061 --> 01:32:09.494
No,

01:32:10.295 --> 01:32:11.555
make it tonight!

01:32:11.793 --> 01:32:14.761
Would he take action so hastily?

01:32:15.161 --> 01:32:17.855
There is only one word to describe
his military tactics. Speed!

01:32:17.929 --> 01:32:20.587
In the battle of Xinye,
Cao Cao's elite cavalries

01:32:20.761 --> 01:32:22.488
rushed one hundred and fifty miles
in just three days

01:32:22.828 --> 01:32:25.018
We had no chance to prepare

01:32:26.159 --> 01:32:28.094
He places surrendered troops
on the frontline,

01:32:28.393 --> 01:32:30.325
while his own trusted army
remains in the back

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.124
Cao Hong, Zhang Liao

01:32:32.494 --> 01:32:34.755
You are to lead the naval forces
on the second front

01:32:35.062 --> 01:32:35.991
Xia-hou Jun and Wei Ben,

01:32:36.292 --> 01:32:37.590
you are to lead the cavalry west

01:32:37.826 --> 01:32:40.727
to provide cover for the navy!

01:32:40.995 --> 01:32:42.787
If the navy is so powerful,

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:45.647
why would they need us for cover?

01:32:50.826 --> 01:32:54.553
Where will their main target be?

01:32:57.992 --> 01:32:59.082
Right here!

01:33:12.124 --> 01:33:14.389
That is the reason why
you camped in Red Cliff

01:33:14.958 --> 01:33:16.219
You have foreseen this

01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:18.319
Yet someone said that
my formations are outdated

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:21.625
I have an even more outdated one

01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:34.315
Bagua formation

01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:36.557
It is indeed outdated

01:33:36.991 --> 01:33:41.390
But when used appropriately,
it will be very effective

01:33:46.758 --> 01:33:48.451
What are you all talking about?

01:33:49.091 --> 01:33:53.147
How can this Bagua formation
be used on water?

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:01.416
Once you drop, it sinks!

01:34:04.224 --> 01:34:06.653
If they think I will use the navy,

01:34:06.956 --> 01:34:10.617
then Zhou Yu and Zhu-ge Liang
really are stupid

01:34:11.058 --> 01:34:13.490
General Cai, your navy is only a diversion

01:34:13.756 --> 01:34:14.449
Understood!

01:34:14.523 --> 01:34:15.647
Xia-hou Jun and Wei Ben,

01:34:15.821 --> 01:34:18.221
take two thousand cavalries by land

01:34:18.289 --> 01:34:19.415
and catch them off-guard

01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:21.922
The majority of the Cao force
is land infantry

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:26.249
Would Cao Cao attack by water?

01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:29.056
What are you thinking of?

01:34:29.558 --> 01:34:30.952
Cao Cao never speaks of
his true intentions,

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.317
even to his own followers

01:34:33.824 --> 01:34:36.151
Truth and illusion are often
disguised as each other

01:34:36.456 --> 01:34:37.785
Cao Cao likes to play this game,

01:34:38.124 --> 01:34:40.587
both with friends and with foes

01:34:47.919 --> 01:34:51.787
What are you doing?
Putting that land tortoise in water?

01:36:07.086 --> 01:36:09.279
Halt!

01:36:24.618 --> 01:36:25.776
Reporting!

01:36:26.418 --> 01:36:28.613
No signs of the Wu army,
within eight miles of the rear hill!

01:36:28.818 --> 01:36:31.806
Nor any trace of civilians!

01:36:33.383 --> 01:36:36.476
All have fled, except for
a tortoise in its shell!

01:36:49.583 --> 01:36:50.515
Charge!

01:36:50.585 --> 01:36:51.550
There may be an ambush

01:36:51.617 --> 01:36:53.243
Am I afraid of a few young girls?

01:38:36.445 --> 01:38:38.376
Shoot!

01:40:37.107 --> 01:40:38.265
The enemy has entered the trap

01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:42.194
This Bagua formation
is not at all outdated!

01:40:44.239 --> 01:40:45.706
Form up!

01:41:26.905 --> 01:41:27.894
It's a trap!

01:41:28.039 --> 01:41:29.766
I predicted this ambush

01:41:30.774 --> 01:41:33.398
Damn! Now the advantage is theirs

01:42:08.269 --> 01:42:10.567
Kill them

01:42:25.904 --> 01:42:26.892
Get back in formation!

01:42:26.970 --> 01:42:30.459
Break through the shields
and attack the enemy!

01:43:52.233 --> 01:43:53.960
Charge!

01:48:48.089 --> 01:48:51.712
Signal the cavalry!
Break through their encirclement!

01:48:52.288 --> 01:48:54.617
I will kill Zhou Yu for this!

01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:58.109
Turn!

01:50:19.619 --> 01:50:21.108
Charge!

01:51:20.851 --> 01:51:23.509
Attack! Kill them!

01:51:35.014 --> 01:51:36.073
Get back in formation!

01:51:36.282 --> 01:51:38.009
Hang in there!

01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:41.842
Hang in there!

01:52:51.711 --> 01:52:53.905
Viceroy!

01:55:00.242 --> 01:55:01.229
Come on!

01:55:17.439 --> 01:55:19.907
Attack!

01:56:03.170 --> 01:56:05.897
Great! This is great!

01:56:34.938 --> 01:56:36.595
Get out!

01:57:07.501 --> 01:57:08.866
Reporting!

01:57:09.437 --> 01:57:10.365
Your Honor,

01:57:10.433 --> 01:57:13.890
Cao Cao's fleet is sailing
towards Red Cliff

01:57:34.568 --> 01:57:36.088
Prime Minister, our army was defeated!

01:57:36.165 --> 01:57:38.828
Our cavalries have never lost a battle

01:57:39.035 --> 01:57:44.432
It is only a slight setback.
No need to panic

01:57:46.232 --> 01:57:50.257
They managed to outfox this old fox

01:57:50.568 --> 01:57:51.557
Look,

01:57:52.099 --> 01:57:54.657
even though we came a long way on water,

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:57.761
not one allied ship
was there to counterattack

01:57:58.032 --> 01:58:01.021
Instead, they ambushed our ground forces

01:58:01.332 --> 01:58:03.730
They were ready for us

01:58:04.167 --> 01:58:06.325
The war against these rebels

01:58:06.735 --> 01:58:08.598
shall not be underestimated

01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:09.830
Prime Minister,

01:58:09.898 --> 01:58:11.694
since they do not have
an adequate naval defense,

01:58:11.867 --> 01:58:14.593
Iet's send out our navy
to destroy the allies!

01:58:14.932 --> 01:58:16.559
I would rather spend more time

01:58:16.734 --> 01:58:19.219
preparing my troops for the naval battle

01:58:19.832 --> 01:58:23.423
Sooner or later,
we will get across the river

01:58:23.767 --> 01:58:27.560
I am still waiting to carve
my poetry onto that cliff

01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:32.063
Right there! Make camp,

01:58:33.166 --> 01:58:35.652
right across from Red Cliff

01:58:36.999 --> 01:58:43.921
Victory! Victory!

01:59:21.429 --> 01:59:22.919
So many ships

01:59:24.431 --> 01:59:25.893
If we used them as firewood,

01:59:26.163 --> 01:59:29.151
it would take a hundred years
to burn them all!

01:59:29.497 --> 01:59:31.260
How can we beat them?

01:59:31.598 --> 01:59:34.060
Cao Cao claimed to have
an army of eight hundred thousand

01:59:34.228 --> 01:59:36.058
It looks like he really does

01:59:36.429 --> 01:59:38.396
So what if he has
eight hundred thousand troops?

01:59:38.730 --> 01:59:41.491
With only one tortoise,
we stalled his army

01:59:41.565 --> 01:59:42.586
Exactly!

01:59:42.661 --> 01:59:46.219
The delay has taken away their momentum

01:59:47.928 --> 01:59:49.418
What do you think?

01:59:51.029 --> 01:59:53.687
Rather than attacking
directly with his navy,

01:59:53.861 --> 01:59:56.851
Cao Cao tried a rear sneak
attack with his cavalry

01:59:57.196 --> 01:59:59.682
He made a mistake

02:00:00.561 --> 02:00:03.653
Now, he will change his tactics

02:00:04.029 --> 02:00:05.585
and begin using his navy

02:00:06.328 --> 02:00:09.521
Cao Cao used only two thousand troops,
to discover our strengths

02:00:09.929 --> 02:00:11.917
But we know nothing of our enemy

02:00:12.426 --> 02:00:15.394
We can only wait for their next attack

02:00:20.062 --> 02:00:21.891
How is your arrow wound?

02:00:23.762 --> 02:00:26.091
Fine. It's only a slight wound

02:00:26.328 --> 02:00:28.316
I owe you this one

02:00:29.529 --> 02:00:31.358
Take it easy

02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:54.652
Victory! Victory!

02:00:54.728 --> 02:00:57.388
They are cheering for victory too early

02:00:57.858 --> 02:01:00.053
With such a good morale,
what is there to fear?

02:01:00.325 --> 02:01:03.813
We need good spirits to win this war

02:01:17.692 --> 02:01:18.884
Your Honor!

02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:21.853
This medicine will cure
the wound very quickly

02:01:22.159 --> 02:01:23.555
Please bear with the pain

02:01:43.423 --> 02:01:44.889
Let me do this

02:02:36.323 --> 02:02:39.311
Let me do something for a wounded soldier

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:43.310
How does my bandage look?

02:02:43.855 --> 02:02:46.322
You wrapped me up like a rice dumpling

02:02:50.823 --> 02:02:55.381
It seems that Cao Cao
isn't as fierce as he seems

02:02:57.753 --> 02:02:59.086
He is indeed fierce

02:02:59.554 --> 02:03:01.521
He is a seasoned military commander

02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:04.182
He will do anything within
his power to gain victory

02:03:04.419 --> 02:03:06.411
He knows how to command an army,

02:03:07.722 --> 02:03:10.017
but he has no friends

02:03:10.419 --> 02:03:13.384
Cao Cao is unlike you

02:03:22.218 --> 02:03:23.313
This toast

02:03:23.521 --> 02:03:25.420
is for Viceroy Zhou!

02:03:26.053 --> 02:03:27.816
To Viceroy Zhou!

02:03:29.654 --> 02:03:30.880
Me too! For Viceroy Zhou!

02:03:31.052 --> 02:03:33.520
I hope he can recover soon

02:03:34.152 --> 02:03:36.746
Toast!

02:03:42.187 --> 02:03:44.243
We joined forces under pressure

02:03:44.554 --> 02:03:46.542
but were successful beyond
our wildest dreams

02:03:46.853 --> 02:03:49.480
Our brilliant victory shocked Cao Cao!

02:03:50.553 --> 02:03:51.677
Duke,

02:03:51.885 --> 02:03:54.352
I have a difficult favor to ask for you

02:03:54.522 --> 02:03:56.006
One hundred thousand refugees

02:03:56.352 --> 02:03:58.343
followed us from Xinye City

02:03:58.654 --> 02:04:00.710
I have no land on which to settle them

02:04:00.985 --> 02:04:02.714
After defeating Cao Cao,

02:04:02.989 --> 02:04:05.712
I would like you to let me
use Jingzhou to settle the people

02:04:05.919 --> 02:04:07.747
Jingzhou is the heartland of the Yangtze

02:04:07.986 --> 02:04:09.179
and a most valuable strategic location

02:04:09.319 --> 02:04:10.684
How could you?

02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:16.742
Only a righteous leader

02:04:17.319 --> 02:04:19.786
owns his land

02:04:19.853 --> 02:04:21.076
Indeed,

02:04:21.250 --> 02:04:23.219
a righteous leader

02:04:23.417 --> 02:04:25.384
may only need a small piece of land

02:04:25.852 --> 02:04:26.683
The Kingdom is vast,

02:04:26.985 --> 02:04:29.006
vast enough to shelter all refugees

02:04:29.384 --> 02:04:31.213
But I am only afraid that

02:04:31.383 --> 02:04:32.816
once soldiers settle in,
they will never leave

02:04:34.684 --> 02:04:36.412
Those in arms are all our own men

02:04:37.019 --> 02:04:40.642
If a Lord is righteous,
then all the Kingdom's men are his to lead

02:04:41.418 --> 02:04:42.347
Come,

02:04:42.552 --> 02:04:43.813
Iet's drink up!

02:04:43.985 --> 02:04:47.211
Toast!

02:04:56.015 --> 02:04:59.243
The princess is a true heroine!

02:05:04.651 --> 02:05:05.911
Lord Liu,

02:05:06.217 --> 02:05:07.546
my younger sister,

02:05:07.748 --> 02:05:10.513
has always admired great gentlemen

02:05:10.752 --> 02:05:12.839
But since she is so fierce,

02:05:13.215 --> 02:05:16.842
I have always worried about her marriage,

02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:21.236
as it is difficult to seek
a suitable gentleman for her

02:05:22.217 --> 02:05:23.410
Brother,

02:05:23.748 --> 02:05:25.909
what are you talking about?

02:05:26.249 --> 02:05:28.148
If the Liu and Sun families
become relatives,

02:05:28.315 --> 02:05:32.043
Then it wouldn't matter how we divided
the land and men, would it?

02:05:35.983 --> 02:05:37.914
The war has just begun

02:05:38.247 --> 02:05:39.407
I...

02:05:39.715 --> 02:05:42.683
have never thought of re-marrying,

02:05:45.746 --> 02:05:47.214
but...

02:06:02.346 --> 02:06:03.679
Brother,

02:06:04.549 --> 02:06:06.410
you must be drunk

02:06:06.847 --> 02:06:08.678
What do you take me for?

02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:11.843
I have found you a fine match

02:06:12.015 --> 02:06:13.811
What's wrong with that?

02:06:16.046 --> 02:06:17.411
Fine

02:06:17.747 --> 02:06:19.041
Then, I will have

02:06:19.346 --> 02:06:21.337
a hundred of my armed maids

02:06:21.547 --> 02:06:24.014
guarding my door,

02:06:25.748 --> 02:06:27.736
and I dare you to step in...

02:06:32.348 --> 02:06:33.574
and...

02:06:34.713 --> 02:06:35.679
Oh, no

02:06:41.981 --> 02:06:43.070
Big Brother!

02:06:44.411 --> 02:06:45.637
Big Brother!

02:06:49.078 --> 02:06:51.377
How rude!

02:06:51.646 --> 02:06:53.133
Brother!

02:06:54.580 --> 02:06:57.567
You have never learned to respect me!

02:07:04.211 --> 02:07:07.541
That's strange. What did I do wrong?

02:07:07.847 --> 02:07:09.866
Big Brother's acupuncture
points are locked

02:07:10.777 --> 02:07:14.232
Brother! Wake up!

02:07:39.244 --> 02:07:41.178
Whatever you do, don't kill my pigeons

02:07:41.679 --> 02:07:45.042
Their acupuncture points are
different from those of men

02:07:45.712 --> 02:07:47.868
I hope I didn't hurt your Lord

02:07:48.676 --> 02:07:52.006
He wouldn't blame you,
even if you hurt him

02:07:52.408 --> 02:07:53.999
Was I outrageously rude?

02:07:54.345 --> 02:07:56.571
I think you are unique

02:07:56.878 --> 02:08:00.534
It is the unique ones
who are the most misunderstood

02:08:02.575 --> 02:08:06.136
I hate those arranged marriages

02:08:06.576 --> 02:08:09.233
Women are pushed around

02:08:09.409 --> 02:08:11.399
like chess pieces

02:08:16.541 --> 02:08:17.564
You are feeding them too much

02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:20.074
They won't be able to fly anymore

02:08:29.643 --> 02:08:34.164
If only I was like them

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:40.031
You want to... fly?

02:08:40.342 --> 02:08:43.137
I have been living in
the palace all my life

02:08:43.641 --> 02:08:45.629
It is such a bore

02:08:46.808 --> 02:08:49.468
Your talents exceed those of others,

02:08:49.641 --> 02:08:51.867
yet you hide them

02:08:53.874 --> 02:08:56.465
Only you can see them

02:09:01.306 --> 02:09:05.740
I used to go hunting with
my brother across the shore

02:09:06.374 --> 02:09:11.069
Back then, the field was full of
people dancing and praying

02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:14.166
Now, it has all become dark and mysterious

02:09:14.741 --> 02:09:18.172
Everything has changed now
that Cao Cao has come

02:09:18.708 --> 02:09:21.036
Before they come here,

02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:24.003
I will go over there

02:09:24.473 --> 02:09:25.903
to take a peek

02:09:26.137 --> 02:09:28.071
and stir up some trouble

02:10:01.505 --> 02:10:04.903
Take care. The weather has turned cold

02:10:07.737 --> 02:10:10.032
I have served the Prime Minister

02:10:10.239 --> 02:10:11.829
for three days already

02:10:12.171 --> 02:10:15.228
Yet, Your Highness
still does not know my name

02:10:15.903 --> 02:10:18.734
My name is... Can you serve tea?

02:10:21.705 --> 02:10:23.671
I can Do so

02:10:45.505 --> 02:10:46.969
Prime Minister,

02:10:47.404 --> 02:10:50.062
we can start the therapy today

02:10:59.667 --> 02:11:02.397
Doctor, what's the matter?

02:11:15.833 --> 02:11:17.131
Tea, Your Highness

02:11:17.201 --> 02:11:18.723
Incorrect,

02:11:21.170 --> 02:11:22.327
try again

02:11:27.268 --> 02:11:29.291
Tea, Your Highness

02:11:31.467 --> 02:11:33.024
That's the way

02:11:33.702 --> 02:11:34.927
Xiao Qiao,

02:11:35.002 --> 02:11:38.489
I have always admired
the way you serve tea

02:11:44.234 --> 02:11:46.894
He started this war

02:11:47.866 --> 02:11:50.958
all because of a woman?

02:12:06.165 --> 02:12:07.325
What are you doing?

02:12:08.699 --> 02:12:09.891
I just gave them a bath

02:12:10.199 --> 02:12:12.358
and am drying them off

02:12:13.866 --> 02:12:15.797
What if they catch a cold?

02:12:18.966 --> 02:12:20.728
How is your wound?

02:12:21.068 --> 02:12:22.326
It's fine

02:12:23.197 --> 02:12:25.631
I heard last night was quite entertaining

02:12:26.833 --> 02:12:30.730
Last night's celebration made me realize

02:12:31.331 --> 02:12:35.128
that we may becomes enemies tomorrow

02:12:39.664 --> 02:12:41.188
When that day comes,

02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:44.158
you and l

02:12:44.566 --> 02:12:47.395
will each serve our own sides

02:12:49.066 --> 02:12:50.325
I cannot stand the thought

02:12:50.665 --> 02:12:53.155
of a stand-off with you

02:12:53.664 --> 02:12:55.958
I hope it never will happen

02:12:56.499 --> 02:12:58.522
You are a brilliant commander

02:12:59.331 --> 02:13:00.820
Fortunately, you are not on Cao Cao's side

02:13:00.997 --> 02:13:02.987
Otherwise, you will be a big trouble

02:13:23.332 --> 02:13:24.796
You've been looking across
the shore for two days now

02:13:25.231 --> 02:13:27.563
What do you see?

02:13:30.630 --> 02:13:32.492
I must remain calm

02:13:34.697 --> 02:13:36.028
How about you?

02:13:37.697 --> 02:13:40.220
I also need to remain calm

02:13:43.965 --> 02:13:45.691
Cao Cao has no experience in naval affairs

02:13:46.129 --> 02:13:47.959
T o cross the river,

02:13:48.330 --> 02:13:51.625
he must rely on Cai Mao and Zhang Yun

02:13:52.530 --> 02:13:54.620
They are both Southerners

02:13:55.027 --> 02:13:58.792
They know all the rocks
and currents in the river

02:13:59.395 --> 02:14:01.386
If we can eliminate them,

02:14:01.796 --> 02:14:05.852
half of the Cao navy will be paralysed

02:14:10.163 --> 02:14:13.526
That... would be rather difficult

02:14:21.227 --> 02:14:24.491
Cao Cao is always very wary of assassins,

02:14:25.029 --> 02:14:31.393
just as his followers are
wary of his deadly temper

02:14:38.795 --> 02:14:41.282
They have interesting fleet formations

02:14:41.793 --> 02:14:43.557
Every formation has its weakness

02:14:43.961 --> 02:14:46.016
It's only up to us to find it

02:14:46.459 --> 02:14:48.723
That shouldn't be too difficult

02:16:27.121 --> 02:16:29.019
Great!

02:16:45.456 --> 02:16:48.650
I never imagined that our soldiers
are also great athletes!

02:17:20.623 --> 02:17:22.950
This is what I call interesting!

02:17:32.055 --> 02:17:34.847
Over all these years
we've been on the battlefields,

02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:36.315
we were never once defeated

02:17:36.555 --> 02:17:38.109
But like a game of Cuju,

02:17:38.287 --> 02:17:42.980
it cannot be exciting
when one side always wins!

02:17:44.117 --> 02:17:45.347
For the battle of Red Cliff,

02:17:45.887 --> 02:17:48.114
we are ready

02:17:48.489 --> 02:17:49.750
I want to see how those rebels react

02:17:49.820 --> 02:17:52.876
once we throw out the ball!

02:19:20.517 --> 02:19:25.141
<i>Shaking the earth, waves hand in hand flow</i>

02:19:25.314 --> 02:19:29.976
<i>No earthly wine can rival the moon's glow</i>

02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:34.206
<i>A smile knows what no words can know</i>

02:19:34.514 --> 02:19:39.539
<i>A passing glance and all is white snow</i>

02:19:39.816 --> 02:19:44.373
<i>Let the mind, not the hands,
defend and fight</i>

02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:49.036
<i>Walls of iron cannot stop our might</i>

02:19:49.314 --> 02:19:53.646
<i>This life, not in vain, not in spite</i>

02:19:53.815 --> 02:19:58.769
<i>From every crucible,
