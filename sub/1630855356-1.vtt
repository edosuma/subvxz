00:54.364 --> 00:56.166
<i>Sure, those pictures of you</i>

00:56.206 --> 00:59.369
<i>in Bora Bora with hubby
and the gang look great.</i>

00:59.409 --> 01:02.612
<i>Those plastic smiles
you so cleverly coaxed out</i>

01:02.652 --> 01:04.934
<i>with bribes
of ice cream and adventure,</i>

01:04.974 --> 01:07.657
<i>but they lead up to that
picture-perfect moment...</i>

01:08.778 --> 01:11.100
<i>long flights
and sleepless nights</i>

01:11.141 --> 01:13.823
<i>snoozing upright with
a flat complimentary pillow.</i>

01:14.544 --> 01:17.867
<i>Isn't it time to book
your first teleportation holiday</i>

01:17.907 --> 01:20.990
<i>with Jiffy Ride,
the first global company</i>

01:21.030 --> 01:24.874
<i>to get you from here to there
in a matter of seconds.</i>

01:24.914 --> 01:26.556
<i>After a day of skiing</i>

01:26.596 --> 01:28.678
<i>the majestic slopes
of the Swiss Alps,</i>

01:28.718 --> 01:31.121
<i>why not relax on
the beautiful beaches of Maui,</i>

01:31.161 --> 01:32.802
<i>Mai Tai in hand?</i>

01:32.842 --> 01:36.246
<i>Choose up to ten stops
for just £3,900,</i>

01:36.286 --> 01:38.728
<i>- or single-destination
holiday--</i> -

01:38.768 --> 01:41.131
<i>The other day,
it was a slew of illegals.</i>

01:41.571 --> 01:43.133
<i>Now, you take the case of</i>

01:43.173 --> 01:46.536
<i>unlicensed motorist
Victor Suarez.</i>

01:46.576 --> 01:48.578
<i>Just got convicted
of manslaughter after</i>

01:48.618 --> 01:51.941
<i>not his first, but
his second traffic violation.</i>

01:51.981 --> 01:55.104
<i>Now, "unlicensed"
in this case, means,</i>

01:55.145 --> 01:58.027
<i>of course,
you guessed it, illegal.</i>

01:58.067 --> 02:00.390
<i>So when police pulled over
this freeloader</i>

02:00.430 --> 02:03.433
<i>for running a red light
back in October,</i>

02:03.473 --> 02:05.195
<i>that could've been
the moment when</i>

02:05.235 --> 02:08.918
<i>Mr. Suarez was sent back home
where he belonged.</i>

02:08.958 --> 02:13.643
<i>And if our judicial system
had been functioning properly,</i>

02:14.083 --> 02:17.127
<i>that's exactly
what would've happened.</i>

02:17.167 --> 02:18.568
<i>But instead, folks,</i>

02:19.489 --> 02:21.171
<i>a little girl is dead.</i>

02:21.971 --> 02:24.854
<i>Now, that's-- that's
what a liberal policy</i>

02:24.894 --> 02:27.697
<i>of tolerance
and second chances gets you.</i>

02:27.737 --> 02:30.940
<i>Oh, sure sounds nice
to help everyone,</i>

02:31.461 --> 02:34.784
<i>but when the cost is the
collapse of our social services</i>

02:34.824 --> 02:36.906
<i>and the lives of our children, and...</i>

02:37.507 --> 02:39.349
<i>well, it begs the question,</i>

02:39.389 --> 02:42.031
<i>does your government even care</i>

02:42.071 --> 02:45.995
<i>about your God-given rights
as a citizen?</i>

02:47.997 --> 02:51.121
<i>Well, here with me today
to debate the topic</i>

02:51.161 --> 02:53.923
<i>- is Professor Adebiyi Jelani.</i>

02:54.484 --> 02:56.646
<i>Now, I know
what you're thinking, folks.</i>

02:56.686 --> 02:59.849
<i>Not everyone with a funny name
is an illegal.</i>

02:59.889 --> 03:03.173
<i>Adebiyi is a first-generation
immigrant from Kenya</i>

03:03.213 --> 03:07.737
<i>whose parents went about it
the right way, the legal route.</i>

03:08.258 --> 03:10.340
<i>Is that so much to ask?</i>

03:10.380 --> 03:12.101
<i>Adebiyi, your thoughts.</i>

03:12.142 --> 03:13.983
<i>First off,
thank you for having me.</i>

03:14.023 --> 03:15.745
<i>But I'd like to get straight
to the heart of the matter</i>

03:15.785 --> 03:17.787
<i>- concerning Mr. Suarez's...</i>
- Fucking coyote.

03:17.827 --> 03:19.389
<i>The government
failed to provide--</i>

03:19.429 --> 03:20.590
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.</i>

03:20.630 --> 03:22.031
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

03:22.071 --> 03:23.713
<i>...with a reasonable path to--</i>

03:23.753 --> 03:26.116
<i>You think
this is the government's fault?</i>

03:26.156 --> 03:28.198
<i>I think it's
a much more complex situation</i>

03:28.238 --> 03:29.479
<i>than we really know.</i>

04:54.604 --> 04:55.725
Get down.

04:55.765 --> 04:57.647
Stay back.

04:58.288 --> 05:01.491
You don't belong here.
This ain't your country.

05:03.373 --> 05:05.375
English. English!

05:06.456 --> 05:09.459
Learn the fucking language
if you're gonna jump the border.

05:13.223 --> 05:15.505
How many more of these
are there out there?

05:24.234 --> 05:26.436
Get down! Down!

05:28.918 --> 05:29.959
Back!

05:31.321 --> 05:32.442
Stay back!

05:42.692 --> 05:44.574
Listen. You--

08:39.469 --> 08:41.711
<i>Incoming call from Janet.</i>

08:43.633 --> 08:44.954
<i>Incoming call.</i>

08:44.994 --> 08:47.557
Hello.

08:47.597 --> 08:49.199
<i>Forgot to mention
we're in the States,</i>

08:49.239 --> 08:51.040
<i>probably won't be back
for a while.</i>

08:51.080 --> 08:54.043
- Very nice. Uh, nice to be home?
<i>- And can you please remember</i>

08:54.083 --> 08:56.766
<i>to take the food
out of the fridge this time?</i>

08:56.806 --> 08:58.648
<i>I don't want it
stinking up the condo.</i>

08:58.688 --> 09:00.089
- Very good.
- <i>Doesn't it look like</i>

09:00.130 --> 09:01.611
<i>she just rolled
out of bed again?</i>

09:01.651 --> 09:04.574
<i>Stop! You're so bad.</i>

09:04.614 --> 09:06.256
<i>And no need to come next week.</i>

09:06.296 --> 09:07.777
<i>We'll let you know
when it's time to restart.</i>

09:07.817 --> 09:09.699
<i>Hopefully the bombings
will end soon.</i>

09:09.739 --> 09:12.862
<i>The chancellor's campaign
is doing wonders for tourism.</i>

09:12.902 --> 09:15.305
- Very good.
<i>- And don't do anything stupid.</i>

09:17.427 --> 09:19.149
Very good.

09:19.189 --> 09:20.950
<i>Oh, my God, babe.
What's the big deal?</i>

09:20.990 --> 09:22.632
<i>She can't understand
half the shit we're--</i>

09:33.563 --> 09:36.486
<i>The UK government
are still scrambling to install</i>

09:36.526 --> 09:38.568
<i>a series of
teleport-proof barriers</i>

09:38.608 --> 09:41.010
<i>in various government locations</i>

09:41.050 --> 09:43.293
<i>which pose
the highest security risk.</i>

09:43.813 --> 09:47.377
<i>This just days after
the previous barriers failed</i>

09:47.417 --> 09:50.059
<i>during a historic breach
in the House of Commons</i>

09:50.099 --> 09:52.462
<i>where five refugees
were teleported in</i>

09:52.502 --> 09:54.224
<i>during a joint session.</i>

09:54.264 --> 09:56.826
<i>The recent achievements
in teleportation technology,</i>

09:56.866 --> 09:58.908
<i>while historic
and revolutionary,</i>

09:58.948 --> 10:00.510
<i>have left both Britain</i>

10:00.550 --> 10:03.433
<i>and legitimate refugees
exposed and vulnerable.</i>

10:03.473 --> 10:05.275
<i>We sat down
with the Home Secretary,</i>

10:05.315 --> 10:07.957
<i>Richard Baqri,
to discuss the issues.</i>

10:07.997 --> 10:09.959
<i>You know, heritage is
something that never leaves you.</i>

10:09.999 --> 10:12.202
<i>If my father
hadn't emigrated to the UK,</i>

10:12.242 --> 10:14.564
<i>legally, 47 years ago,</i>

10:14.604 --> 10:16.686
<i>then I could easily be
the one trying to do so now.</i>

10:16.726 --> 10:18.488
<i>I-- I think that's
what qualifies me</i>

10:18.528 --> 10:21.251
<i>- to be the perfect empath.</i>
- "Perfect em-- empath."

10:21.291 --> 10:23.253
<i>What is happening
to these refugees</i>

10:23.293 --> 10:25.135
<i>is truly abominable.</i>

10:25.175 --> 10:27.977
<i>You hear stories of refugees
paying for passage to the UK</i>

10:28.017 --> 10:30.820
<i>or to the United States
and instead being sent</i>

10:30.860 --> 10:33.022
<i>- just offshore of the...</i>
- "Offshore."

10:33.062 --> 10:34.664
<i>...you know,
drowning in the ocean.</i>

10:34.704 --> 10:35.985
<i>You know, human trafficking.</i>

10:36.506 --> 10:38.308
<i>- Terrorism.</i>
- "Terrorism."

10:38.348 --> 10:40.910
<i>Long-term side effects
when jumpers are left in limbo.</i>

10:40.950 --> 10:42.952
<i>What I'm proposing
to do with my new plan...</i>

12:37.547 --> 12:40.390
Hey, hon. When are you
coming home tonight?

12:40.910 --> 12:42.472
I have a surprise for us.

12:56.206 --> 12:58.888
Ah. Who are you?

13:00.570 --> 13:02.132
Lev is my father.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.493
Lev sent you?

13:04.494 --> 13:06.095
Why didn't he come himself?

13:06.136 --> 13:07.977
He knows I don't like it
when things don't go to plan.

13:09.979 --> 13:11.381
He said that I--

13:12.222 --> 13:13.263
That you could...

13:13.943 --> 13:16.186
Tell Lev I don't
fuck little boys.

13:19.108 --> 13:21.631
I can't afford to lose
what I paid for the room.

13:55.385 --> 13:56.426
Take seat.

14:11.321 --> 14:12.762
Where is your father?

14:15.605 --> 14:16.646
Next door?

14:18.007 --> 14:19.449
He-- he wants proof.

14:24.294 --> 14:27.177
If you don't go through with
this, what will he do to you?

14:28.178 --> 14:30.820
What-- what happens to everyone
born perverted like me?

14:35.625 --> 14:37.867
Do you have someone special
in your life?

14:43.953 --> 14:45.555
Are you in love with him?

14:48.678 --> 14:49.759
Yes.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.401
I am.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.470
Your father
will be able to hear.

15:20.510 --> 15:22.152
He knows I put on a show.

15:22.192 --> 15:23.433
If he hears nothing,

15:23.473 --> 15:25.195
that won't be good
for you or for I.

15:25.235 --> 15:26.956
I don't think
I can go through with this.

15:26.996 --> 15:28.398
That's not what I'm saying.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.040
We don't have to do anything.

15:32.282 --> 15:34.404
Maybe make a bit of noise.

15:35.044 --> 15:36.446
Can you do that?

15:41.251 --> 15:43.012
Fuck off!

17:40.410 --> 17:41.611
Hello?

17:44.414 --> 17:45.455
Daddy.

18:29.939 --> 18:31.301
Where did you get this?

18:34.224 --> 18:35.665
You need to
practice your English.

18:36.706 --> 18:37.867
Why?

18:42.432 --> 18:43.953
I got it from work.

18:47.597 --> 18:48.638
It's good.

18:50.079 --> 18:51.121
Hmm?

19:34.924 --> 19:36.166
Is it your father?

19:42.452 --> 19:43.493
Volkov.

19:46.416 --> 19:49.018
He got murdered
by the police today.

19:50.460 --> 19:51.501
I saw.

20:39.108 --> 20:42.031
She always speaks
to her husband in English

20:42.071 --> 20:43.633
- thinking I don't understand.
- Mmm.

20:49.759 --> 20:51.601
Fancy.

20:51.641 --> 20:54.524
Pretend we are rich.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.701
What happens

21:13.022 --> 21:15.185
if we get enough
for one of us to jump?

21:15.865 --> 21:16.906
Then we wait.

21:19.269 --> 21:21.391
- You're not gonna leave me?
- No.

21:22.112 --> 21:24.874
Maybe I find myself
a nice English girl.

21:40.490 --> 21:43.613
If you're not paying the jumper,
someone else is.

21:47.297 --> 21:48.498
Anya!

21:49.339 --> 21:50.820
I've come to
speak to my daughter.

21:51.301 --> 21:52.462
I know she's in there.

21:52.822 --> 21:55.425
Go away.
There's no one else here.

21:55.465 --> 21:56.786
I just want to talk.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.470
Look, I brought her this.

22:02.232 --> 22:03.913
Her mother made it.
It's her favorite.

22:03.953 --> 22:05.755
She doesn't want to talk to you.

22:05.795 --> 22:07.517
I've come to apologize.

22:07.557 --> 22:09.399
Please. Take it.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.361
It's for the both of you.

22:12.562 --> 22:14.324
I don't need to approve
of my daughter's choices

22:14.364 --> 22:15.405
in order to love her.

22:15.765 --> 22:17.607
We have our own food.

24:04.794 --> 24:07.717
- Ekaterina!
- Whoa, whoa!

24:07.757 --> 24:10.240
- Stay back. Nothing to fear.
- Wait. Wait.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.681
I will take her home.

24:11.721 --> 24:13.323
Both are coming with me.

24:13.363 --> 24:14.884
This is not what we agreed.

24:14.924 --> 24:16.886
Step aside.
Do not interfere.

24:16.926 --> 24:19.088
- Get down on your knees!
- You cannot take my daughter!

24:28.258 --> 24:30.380
Hands on your head.
Hands on your head!

24:30.820 --> 24:33.143
Cooperate. Do not resist.
Did you get it?

24:33.183 --> 24:34.664
Hands on your head!

24:34.704 --> 24:36.466
Leave-- leave her alone.

24:36.506 --> 24:37.867
- Do not get involved.
- Leave her alone! I'll go!

24:37.907 --> 24:39.028
Get your hands
on your head! Hey!

24:51.040 --> 24:52.962
No, no, no. Hey, hey!

channel, you fucking arsehole!

27:17.747 --> 27:19.709
<i>...delaying the
asylum stages for refugees is--</i>

27:19.749 --> 27:21.471
Shut up, you fuck!

27:25.115 --> 27:26.836
Fuck, it's cold in here!

27:30.280 --> 27:31.801
The fuck did I come here for?

27:36.366 --> 27:37.527
These babies.

27:38.128 --> 27:39.689
Let's have a look at you.

27:41.411 --> 27:42.452
Yes.

27:43.173 --> 27:45.895
Oh, there you are,
you lovely beauties.

27:46.456 --> 27:48.338
All right, why don't we?

27:48.378 --> 27:50.380
Let's turn you guys on.

27:50.420 --> 27:53.303
Like you turn me on.

27:53.343 --> 27:55.945
All right. There she is.

27:56.586 --> 27:58.268
Hello, darling. You all right?

27:58.308 --> 28:00.430
Not you yet.
You stay there, all right?

28:01.151 --> 28:02.312
How are you, Pipes?

28:02.352 --> 28:03.433
Don't get jealous, now.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.794
Come on,
I love you all the same.

28:05.275 --> 28:07.397
Well, apart from you.
You are my favorite. Shh.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.320
You're gonna make me
loads of money, you are.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.562
Yeah. Let's get you in there.

28:12.602 --> 28:15.765
All right. Let's get you
activated, shall we?

28:15.805 --> 28:18.047
Fuck.

28:18.888 --> 28:20.089
Who the fuck is that?

28:21.331 --> 28:23.533
Oh, fuck. Come on.

28:23.973 --> 28:25.094
Come on--

28:34.624 --> 28:36.025
Hey, what do you want?

28:36.065 --> 28:38.348
Hey! It's the middle
of the bloody night.

28:38.388 --> 28:40.950
English, English!

28:40.990 --> 28:42.352
What is up with you people?

28:42.392 --> 28:43.713
We need to leave.

28:43.753 --> 28:45.555
I operate
by appointment only.

28:45.595 --> 28:47.597
You can't just bang on my door
and expect a flipping miracle!

28:47.637 --> 28:48.998
We have money!

28:53.323 --> 28:54.364
Wait there.

29:00.330 --> 29:01.411
What's wrong with her?

29:01.451 --> 29:03.133
- She looks pale.
- I'm fine.

29:03.173 --> 29:04.614
We just need to leave.

29:04.654 --> 29:06.656
All right, let's move then.
Time is money.

29:13.183 --> 29:14.544
This ain't even half.

29:15.024 --> 29:16.346
Come on.

29:16.386 --> 29:18.628
There better be something good
in here, I'll tell you.

29:21.751 --> 29:23.313
What the--
what do you think this is?

29:23.353 --> 29:24.994
- A flipping pawn shop?
- Please.

29:25.034 --> 29:27.277
Do you think jumping
your arse to the promised land

29:27.317 --> 29:29.959
- is 100% profit on my end?
- Please!

29:29.999 --> 29:31.561
Quit with the fuckin' please,
all right?

29:31.601 --> 29:34.003
- They will kill us.
- That's not my problem, darling.

29:34.043 --> 29:35.925
If I make it my problem--

29:38.368 --> 29:40.130
But what happens when you girls
get to the other side?

29:41.131 --> 29:42.572
You want jump to England, right?

29:43.012 --> 29:45.335
But what happens
when you get there?

29:45.775 --> 29:47.257
- You got family?
- No.

29:47.297 --> 29:50.540
No. Well, for two jumps
to the UK at this price,

29:50.580 --> 29:52.422
I'm operating at a loss.

29:54.063 --> 29:57.187
It means not only
am I not making any money,

29:57.227 --> 29:58.868
but I'm spending money.

29:58.908 --> 30:01.070
So the way I see it,
you got two options.

30:01.111 --> 30:02.672
They will kill us. Please.

30:02.712 --> 30:05.115
You got two fucking options!

30:05.155 --> 30:08.558
Look, do you even understand
how this technology works?

30:10.520 --> 30:12.602
It's all about distance, right?

30:12.642 --> 30:15.325
Look, if I jump you
from one side of the room

30:15.885 --> 30:18.288
to the other, that's cheap.

30:18.728 --> 30:20.410
Now, I just walk over here,

30:20.970 --> 30:21.971
all right?

30:22.732 --> 30:26.015
Put this down,
and bam, you're there.

30:26.055 --> 30:27.657
Cheap as chips.

30:27.697 --> 30:30.500
Of course,
receivers are single use.

30:30.540 --> 30:32.622
So I'm out about 100 quid.

30:32.662 --> 30:36.226
But if I gotta jump your arse
halfway around the world,

30:36.266 --> 30:39.549
well, that takes a million bits
of admin to make it happen.

30:39.989 --> 30:42.672
We gotta smuggle receivers
across multiple borders

30:42.712 --> 30:45.995
or find some geezer
with the technical know-how

30:46.035 --> 30:47.997
to replicate
one of these bad boys

30:48.037 --> 30:50.200
in the country
that you wanna go.

30:50.840 --> 30:51.881
You follow?

30:52.562 --> 30:54.964
Bottom line is, it's expensive.

30:55.004 --> 30:57.887
It's a fucking ball ache
and I don't do it for free.

30:57.927 --> 30:59.409
Oh, don't pull that shits
on me, all right?

30:59.449 --> 31:01.010
Go on, shoot me.
Shoot me, go on!

31:01.050 --> 31:02.292
See how far that gets you.

31:03.333 --> 31:06.656
Um, why do some
flash red and some green?

31:09.419 --> 31:12.342
Green ones are ready to jump,
all right?

31:12.382 --> 31:14.664
But there's no way
you're smuggling a live one

31:14.704 --> 31:16.146
across the border.

31:16.186 --> 31:18.508
Red means they're locked,

31:18.548 --> 31:21.111
and unless you've got the code
to make 'em go green,

31:21.591 --> 31:23.513
there's no turning up
at point B.

31:23.553 --> 31:26.035
Capiche?

31:26.796 --> 31:28.718
Lucky for you,
I got some of these

31:28.758 --> 31:30.400
just smuggled across the border.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.802
I jump you there,
you're in neutral territory.

31:32.842 --> 31:35.405
You fend for yourselves,
you hike it to England.

31:35.445 --> 31:37.327
Hike it to the fucking moon
for all I care.

31:37.367 --> 31:39.369
Point is, it's the cheapest way

31:39.409 --> 31:41.651
to immediately mitigate
your risk in this country.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.453
No. We go England.

31:43.493 --> 31:44.934
You're not both
going tonight, darling.

31:44.974 --> 31:46.656
Not on my dime, all right?

31:46.696 --> 31:49.859
So, if England it is,
which one of you two are going?

31:50.340 --> 31:52.622
Hmm?
I jump one of you there, right?

31:53.022 --> 31:56.306
You settle in,
you make some money, yeah?

31:56.346 --> 31:58.388
And I jump the other one
in a few months' time.

32:01.391 --> 32:04.033
Hello? Ladies?
Come on, time's money.

32:04.954 --> 32:06.676
Who will be on the other side?

32:07.717 --> 32:11.121
Orla Miller!
Hey, babes, you all right?

32:11.161 --> 32:12.802
<i>Vas.</i>

32:12.842 --> 32:14.364
<i>It must be late there.</i>

32:14.404 --> 32:17.327
Yeah, you know how it is.
No rest for the wicked.

32:17.367 --> 32:19.849
Look, I know it's unscheduled,
but you've got, uh,

32:19.889 --> 32:21.891
capacity for a jump
coming your way tonight?

32:22.652 --> 32:24.174
<i>Oh, you poor thing.</i>

32:24.214 --> 32:25.895
Yeah, she, uh--
she needs to raise some funds

32:25.935 --> 32:27.977
and hopefully bring over
a friend in a few months' time.

32:28.017 --> 32:30.019
I told her you might
be able to sponsor a stay

32:30.059 --> 32:31.221
at your safe house.

32:31.261 --> 32:32.622
<i>Yeah, absolutely.</i>

32:32.662 --> 32:34.624
<i>You remember Mr. Green?</i>

32:34.664 --> 32:37.267
<i>Well, a generous donation came
in from him just this morning.</i>

32:37.307 --> 32:38.828
Fantastic.

32:38.868 --> 32:40.710
All right, I'll send them over.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.113
Give 'em a good spank when they
get there. All right, darling?

33:10.620 --> 33:11.661
Welcome.

33:13.062 --> 33:14.103
It's all right.

33:17.467 --> 33:19.189
All right,
let me get you some water.

33:31.361 --> 33:32.402
Here.

33:43.052 --> 33:44.814
Here you are, my dear.

33:52.462 --> 33:54.063
That's all right.
Take your time.

34:03.433 --> 34:04.874
Can I call home?

34:04.914 --> 34:06.796
Yeah. You have
plenty of time for all that.

34:07.317 --> 34:10.320
For now, just try the bath.
It's nice. I promise.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.383
Oh, God, what happened here?

34:34.264 --> 34:36.426
Did you make the dump
whilst wounded?

34:36.466 --> 34:39.189
Did Vas not warn you
of the damage that could cause?

34:39.229 --> 34:40.270
- I need to take--
- No!

34:40.670 --> 34:42.112
No, it could cause an infection.

34:42.152 --> 34:43.193
No.

34:44.994 --> 34:47.757
Well, the bathwater's gonna soak
right through that dressing.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.402
Let's run you a shower.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.614
Stay in here
as long as you like.

35:04.654 --> 35:05.735
You deserve it.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.957
Ah.
Good morning, weary traveler.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.199
How did you sleep?

36:50.360 --> 36:52.522
- Good.
- You hungry?

36:52.562 --> 36:53.963
I'm just having something light.

36:54.003 --> 36:56.566
Berries, nuts, yogurt. Fancy?

36:57.527 --> 36:58.848
Yes, thank you.

36:58.888 --> 37:00.570
The other girls
are still asleep.

37:00.610 --> 37:03.293
It's quite early,
but probably not for you.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.335
The jump lag
will wear off in a few days.

37:06.296 --> 37:08.097
Oh. Tea, coffee?

37:10.260 --> 37:12.021
Everyone does
their bit around here.

37:12.061 --> 37:13.463
You'll learn that.

37:13.503 --> 37:15.064
But for now
you get the royal treatment.

37:15.585 --> 37:17.627
Yeah, we just
take turns cooking meals.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.068
It's fair that way, you know?

37:21.391 --> 37:24.754
To be honest, in rescuing strays
from four corners of the Earth,

37:24.794 --> 37:28.438
the diversity of food cooked
in this kitchen is to die for.

37:28.478 --> 37:31.641
Mexican one night,
Thai the next, Indian.

37:33.243 --> 37:34.804
Oh, what's your favorite dish?

37:34.844 --> 37:36.486
I'll see if we can't
whip it up for you tonight.

37:37.287 --> 37:38.568
Anything is fine.

37:38.968 --> 37:40.530
No, no, it's no bother.

37:40.570 --> 37:42.172
I want you to rack your brains.

37:42.212 --> 37:43.733
Place your order by midday
just so I can make sure

37:43.773 --> 37:45.135
we have the right ingredients.

37:46.976 --> 37:48.538
How many people do you help?

37:48.978 --> 37:50.220
Oh, gosh.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.662
Must be over 50 women by now.

37:53.143 --> 37:55.865
Yeah. You're just one of five
here at the moment, though.

38:24.654 --> 38:25.895
Let me see your hands.

38:26.696 --> 38:28.698
Oh, these are in a right state.

38:42.912 --> 38:45.635
Oh, relax. You'll enjoy it.

38:46.236 --> 38:47.957
People pay good money for this.

39:13.943 --> 39:16.986
Right.
Do you have a favorite color?

39:18.228 --> 39:19.749
Black.

39:19.789 --> 39:22.031
Black's not a color.
It's the absence of color.

39:22.552 --> 39:25.635
Oh, well, we do have
this black little number here,

39:25.675 --> 39:27.597
but I'm not sure
you'll have much use for it yet.

39:28.077 --> 39:31.241
We'll have to find you a dashing
English boyfriend first.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.524
I think it's best
to start practical.

39:35.125 --> 39:38.568
Ah.
Now, what you need is a big hug,

39:38.608 --> 39:40.410
and this looks like a big hug.

39:40.450 --> 39:43.293
You could nestle up
with a cup of tea and a book.

39:43.333 --> 39:44.854
Do you read in English?

39:45.655 --> 39:47.177
- Yes.
- Good.

39:47.217 --> 39:49.579
That'll help you assimilate
and find work.

39:49.619 --> 39:51.461
But no rush on that, mind you.

39:51.501 --> 39:52.782
Plenty of time yet.

39:52.822 --> 39:54.784
I'd like to
start work right away.

39:55.545 --> 39:58.748
Well, most of the work available
to girls in your situation

39:58.788 --> 40:00.029
isn't anything glamorous.

40:00.670 --> 40:02.071
What did you do back home?

40:03.753 --> 40:04.794
I was maid.

40:05.955 --> 40:07.317
Oh, that'll explain
the state of your nails.

40:07.357 --> 40:09.279
All that bleach
and what have you.

40:09.319 --> 40:10.880
Gosh, it dries out the skin.

40:11.521 --> 40:14.404
You know, we had a girl here
a little less than a year ago,

40:14.444 --> 40:15.725
she was a maid.

40:15.765 --> 40:16.966
Moved on now, though.

40:18.128 --> 40:19.769
I'd be happy to be
your first customer.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.492
You give me bed.
I can't charge you.

40:23.052 --> 40:24.454
But maybe if you like my work,

40:24.494 --> 40:26.216
you recommend me
to your friends.

40:26.256 --> 40:28.538
Don't be silly.
I'm happy to pay.

40:28.578 --> 40:30.620
Is £1000 a month all right?

40:30.660 --> 40:32.101
Ah, let's make it 1200.

40:32.142 --> 40:34.023
I'm sure you're just
what this house needs.

40:34.664 --> 40:37.307
Okay, uh, try these on,
and if anything doesn't fit,

40:37.347 --> 40:39.028
just let me know,
I'll get you something else.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.644
Oh, God. You gave me a fright.
Can I get you anything?

41:34.684 --> 41:36.166
I'd like to call home.

41:36.206 --> 41:37.887
Ah, shoot.

41:37.927 --> 41:40.970
The internet's down, I'm afraid.
I'm just working offline,

41:41.010 --> 41:42.852
but I'll be sure to let you know
when it's back up.

41:45.255 --> 41:47.096
Where are your
cleaning products?

41:47.137 --> 41:48.978
Oh, don't worry about that now.

41:49.018 --> 41:52.021
Just make yourself at home.
What's another few days of dust?

42:00.230 --> 42:02.031
Tara, this is Ekaterina.

42:02.632 --> 42:04.354
She'll be doing
the cleaning around here.

42:08.158 --> 42:10.120
Tara's our resident masseuse.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.682
She's been with us
for quite a few months now.

42:12.722 --> 42:13.883
Haven't you, Tara?

42:16.246 --> 42:18.047
Well, you know your way around.

42:18.087 --> 42:20.049
Maybe you could show her
some of the amenities?

42:26.416 --> 42:28.057
I prefer to leave it on.

42:29.739 --> 42:30.780
Turn around.

42:47.717 --> 42:48.758
So...

42:49.719 --> 42:51.281
how much Orla pay you, girl?

42:53.163 --> 42:54.204
Hmm?

42:56.646 --> 42:58.087
1000 sound about right.

42:59.249 --> 43:01.931
No... make it 1200.

43:05.415 --> 43:07.457
That old bitch, always
up to the same old tricks.

43:10.300 --> 43:11.341
Turn over.

43:21.311 --> 43:22.912
You try to bring somebody over?

43:23.753 --> 43:25.635
- No.
- Mmm.

43:26.356 --> 43:27.677
I don't believe you.

43:28.958 --> 43:30.680
Everybody try
to jump somebody over.

43:35.925 --> 43:39.329
You know,
I heard about your country.

43:40.450 --> 43:42.172
You're not
the first refugee I've met.

43:44.894 --> 43:47.817
Maybe, you know, your sister,
you try to bring over.

43:48.458 --> 43:49.499
Hmm?

43:50.660 --> 43:52.061
Maybe your girlfriend.

43:53.423 --> 43:54.464
You know...

43:55.665 --> 43:59.309
I know faster ways
you can make money

43:59.349 --> 44:00.830
other than cleaning house.

44:05.595 --> 44:06.636
You heard me, girl.

44:15.645 --> 44:19.008
Mmm! Thank you, Chyou,
for tonight's cuisine.

44:19.809 --> 44:21.411
Say thank you, girls.

44:21.451 --> 44:24.294
What is this?
An English boarding school?

44:25.895 --> 44:29.659
And welcome to the new
addition of our family,

44:29.699 --> 44:31.381
Ekaterina.

44:32.021 --> 44:34.504
Now, Kat-- Can I call you Kat?

44:35.345 --> 44:36.586
This is fine.

44:37.307 --> 44:39.469
Kat may just be
scrubbing toilets around here,

44:39.509 --> 44:42.312
but remember,
everyone in this house is equal.

44:42.352 --> 44:44.474
You're to treat her
with the proper respect.

44:44.994 --> 44:46.916
No excuses not to
pick up after yourselves.

44:48.558 --> 44:50.720
Tidiness shows courtesy
to others in the house.

44:58.848 --> 45:00.690
Is wine not enough for you,
Tara?

45:15.665 --> 45:17.347
Such displays of excess

45:17.387 --> 45:19.709
will be reflected
in your monthly contribution.

45:32.482 --> 45:34.083
Oh, girls!

45:34.124 --> 45:36.246
Is this how you're gonna
treat Kat on her first night?

45:36.286 --> 45:37.967
Is not problem.

45:38.007 --> 45:40.490
It's nearly curfew.
Go to bed, the lot of you.

45:41.451 --> 45:44.374
- Here, I've got this, love.
- I'd like to help.

45:44.414 --> 45:45.855
No, no, no, no. I got it.

45:46.336 --> 45:47.617
You enjoy this time.

45:47.657 --> 45:49.179
You won't be
the new girl forever.

46:24.454 --> 46:26.456
Can I get you
something to drink, Ambassador?

46:26.896 --> 46:28.338
Oh, yes.

46:28.378 --> 46:31.060
Uh, snakebite?
If you-- if you have.

46:31.100 --> 46:32.542
Yes, that's not a problem.

46:36.146 --> 46:39.789
Uh,
I'll be completely honest,

46:39.829 --> 46:42.432
I'm new to this experience.

46:42.472 --> 46:45.995
Is, uh, every masseuse
the same price?

46:46.035 --> 46:47.997
Well, what did you have in mind?

46:48.037 --> 46:49.959
I mean,
everything's available

46:49.999 --> 46:51.441
for a price, right?

47:13.623 --> 47:15.305
Trouble sleeping last night?

47:16.186 --> 47:17.227
Come in.

47:29.959 --> 47:31.000
Sit.

47:34.124 --> 47:36.446
You probably
have some questions.

47:38.007 --> 47:39.489
It is none of my business.

47:39.529 --> 47:41.050
Oh, don't be silly.

47:41.090 --> 47:42.972
This is your home
for the time being,

47:43.012 --> 47:45.575
and everyone has a right
to know what goes on

47:45.615 --> 47:47.657
inside their own four walls,
don't you think?

47:49.219 --> 47:52.862
I wish all of my girls
could be a maid like you...

47:55.225 --> 47:56.586
but who am I to judge them?

47:56.626 --> 47:58.188
I didn't see anything.

47:58.228 --> 47:59.789
You're not in trouble, Kat.

48:00.790 --> 48:02.632
As women,
we're born into trouble.

48:02.672 --> 48:04.874
We don't need to make life
any harder for our sisters

48:04.914 --> 48:06.356
than it already is.

48:08.878 --> 48:11.761
Some of the women
who stay with me

48:11.801 --> 48:13.763
have decided
for themselves that...

48:14.524 --> 48:17.727
the easiest way for them
to get ahead in this life

48:17.767 --> 48:19.929
is to give men what they want.

48:20.770 --> 48:21.811
Do you understand?

48:23.453 --> 48:25.495
Life isn't kind, Kat.

48:25.535 --> 48:29.379
It doesn't give immigrants
many options, illegal or not.

48:29.419 --> 48:33.223
Well, they can work themselves
to death in a field or a factory

48:33.263 --> 48:36.146
and scrimp and save
and skip meals

48:36.186 --> 48:39.189
and bring their family over
after a decade if they're lucky.

48:39.709 --> 48:42.112
A decade of their life, gone.

48:43.753 --> 48:46.876
But take that immigrant,
a woman,

48:47.797 --> 48:49.799
put her on her back in a bed,

48:50.560 --> 48:52.842
and she can make enough
in a few months,

48:53.643 --> 48:56.486
and then she'll never
have to give herself away again.

48:59.809 --> 49:02.892
Now, I know
what my girls can be like.

49:04.374 --> 49:06.376
It just makes them
feel better about themselves

49:06.416 --> 49:08.658
knowing that they're
not doing it alone, you know?

49:10.300 --> 49:11.661
But I want you to know

49:12.342 --> 49:15.585
that you must never feel
pressured into doing anything

49:15.625 --> 49:17.707
with your body
that you don't want to do.

49:21.991 --> 49:23.513
<i>You come here like a serpent</i>

49:23.553 --> 49:25.635
<i>to finesse your way
into my fortune,</i>

49:25.675 --> 49:27.997
<i>but it's not going to work!</i>

49:28.037 --> 49:29.999
Turn it off.
This is rubbish.

49:30.039 --> 49:32.322
<i>So how can I have
an American bastard?</i>

49:32.362 --> 49:34.644
<i>- My mother loved you--</i>
- Change channel.

49:34.684 --> 49:36.366
<i>I don't care about your money.</i>

49:36.406 --> 49:38.047
Change the channel.

49:39.088 --> 49:41.291
Change the channel!

49:41.331 --> 49:44.494
Oh, there he is!

49:44.534 --> 49:48.017
Taraji, your boyfriend
is back on the telly.

49:48.057 --> 49:50.500
He come to take you away.

49:51.060 --> 49:52.622
Taraji!

49:52.662 --> 49:56.346
Come to see
your sexy, sexy Mr. Green.

49:56.946 --> 49:59.149
<i>People from the
LGBTQ+ community</i>

49:59.189 --> 50:01.911
<i>who have found themselves
targeted by the state...</i>

50:03.833 --> 50:05.435
<i>You remember Mr. Green?</i>

50:05.955 --> 50:08.638
<i>Well, a generous donation came
in from him just this morning.</i>

50:16.366 --> 50:18.328
<i>Oh, now, George.</i>

50:18.368 --> 50:21.090
<i>Come on. That is below you.
In this point...</i>

50:36.466 --> 50:37.867
Let me see.

50:41.871 --> 50:43.072
Oh! Hey.

50:45.355 --> 50:47.277
Christ!
There's blood everywhere.

50:47.317 --> 50:51.121
Let me see. Let me see.
Jesus, what's happened?

50:51.801 --> 50:52.842
Where's Tara?

50:53.603 --> 50:54.844
Peter?

50:54.884 --> 50:56.606
She needs this looked at
by a doctor.

50:57.046 --> 50:59.369
Right, for now,
uh, let's, um, wrap her head.

50:59.409 --> 51:01.050
Chyou,
there's gauze and bandages

51:01.090 --> 51:02.532
in the downstairs bathroom.

51:02.572 --> 51:04.894
Chyou, go! Peter?

51:05.455 --> 51:06.736
Oh, God.

51:07.537 --> 51:10.019
- Peter, get the car.
- She won't be deported?

51:10.059 --> 51:12.382
Well, that's a risk she's
gonna have to take, isn't it?

52:04.914 --> 52:07.437
What are you looking for there,
girl? Hmm?

52:08.118 --> 52:09.799
Just seeing where things are.

52:10.880 --> 52:11.921
Sure you are.

52:20.770 --> 52:22.212
Did you hear about Marzanna?

52:22.252 --> 52:24.854
Who's Marzanna?

52:24.894 --> 52:26.736
Don't know no Marzanna.

52:27.937 --> 52:30.860
People come, people go,

52:30.900 --> 52:33.223
people kept in limbo.

52:33.263 --> 52:34.304
But you...

52:37.026 --> 52:38.067
you're here now.

52:40.069 --> 52:41.671
You going to help me
with Mr. Pink?

52:41.711 --> 52:42.912
Mr. Pink?

52:43.953 --> 52:47.397
He likes his chocolate
and vanilla swirl.

52:50.200 --> 52:52.041
You don't even last a year
around here now.

52:53.082 --> 52:54.524
I'm just the maid.

52:54.564 --> 52:55.685
I was the maid.

52:56.926 --> 52:57.967
Chyou.

52:59.169 --> 53:00.210
Salima.

53:01.451 --> 53:03.413
Tomorrow, a new girl
will jump into this house

53:03.453 --> 53:05.094
and take your place.

53:05.575 --> 53:06.776
You can fight it...

53:08.097 --> 53:09.899
but you will end up
just like the rest of us.

53:11.941 --> 53:13.102
On your knees

53:13.823 --> 53:17.187
with a tiny English prick
in your mouth,

53:17.747 --> 53:19.709
struggling to keep him hard.

53:39.689 --> 53:40.810
Clean this up.

53:51.501 --> 53:53.663
Oh, no.

53:53.703 --> 53:56.466
- What's happened here?
- It was accident.

53:57.427 --> 53:58.708
Whose accident?

54:00.110 --> 54:03.953
She wanted help with Mr. Pink.

54:04.594 --> 54:06.316
Of course she did.

54:07.076 --> 54:09.999
Oh, the pieces of the puzzle
are coming together now.

54:11.921 --> 54:16.005
They used to...
service Mr. Pink together.

54:16.646 --> 54:19.889
And I have a feeling Marzanna
didn't want to do it anymore,

54:19.929 --> 54:21.651
so Tara might have--

54:22.652 --> 54:25.735
I really don't like
to think that one of my girls

54:25.775 --> 54:27.297
could do this to another, but...

54:28.298 --> 54:30.580
it's not out of the realm
of possibility, now, is it?

54:31.221 --> 54:32.462
How is Marzanna?

54:33.223 --> 54:34.824
You shouldn't feel any pressure.

54:36.746 --> 54:37.787
Do you?

54:39.389 --> 54:42.312
Oh, sweetheart.
She's just a bully.

54:42.352 --> 54:43.793
You know,
if I find out for a fact

54:43.833 --> 54:45.115
that she did
do this to Marzanna,

54:45.155 --> 54:46.796
I will kick her
out of this house.

54:46.836 --> 54:48.598
You don't owe her anything.

54:52.802 --> 54:55.485
I was not, um, maid

54:56.286 --> 54:57.407
in my country.

55:03.853 --> 55:07.056
Well, you did what you had to do
to get out of there, didn't you?

55:08.218 --> 55:09.619
And you're here now.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.984
If I service these men,

55:15.024 --> 55:17.627
Mr. Green,
how much could I make?

55:31.521 --> 55:35.405
Mr. Blue!
How lovely to see you again.

55:35.445 --> 55:37.887
- Hello.
- It's been a while, hasn't it?

55:37.927 --> 55:39.289
It has.
Well, I've been busy, busy,

55:39.329 --> 55:41.211
you know,
with the holidays and whatnot.

55:41.251 --> 55:43.092
Oh, you've brought
a little something with you.

55:43.133 --> 55:46.216
Yes, I have. Well, why don't
you join in the fun, my dear?

55:46.256 --> 55:48.017
Can I pour you a drink?

55:48.057 --> 55:50.019
Scotch, single malt,
if I remember correctly?

55:50.059 --> 55:51.941
Oh, yes,
that would be, uh, delightful.

55:52.862 --> 55:55.505
Ah. A new face, I see.

55:56.306 --> 55:57.347
Ah.

55:58.668 --> 55:59.789
Evening, ladies.

56:01.271 --> 56:02.312
Ah...

56:03.153 --> 56:05.395
I remember you,
my African queen.

56:05.435 --> 56:06.596
Do you remember me?

56:06.636 --> 56:08.118
Of course you do,
of course you do.

56:08.758 --> 56:10.120
Not tonight, sorry.

56:10.160 --> 56:11.721
Fond memories and everything.

56:11.761 --> 56:13.483
For the both of us, I hope.

56:13.523 --> 56:14.724
Yes...

56:16.045 --> 56:19.088
No, tonight, I think
I'm rather in the mood for...

56:19.969 --> 56:21.010
sweet and sour.

56:23.373 --> 56:24.414
Shall we?

56:28.698 --> 56:30.380
Well, now, Orla.

56:30.420 --> 56:33.223
You didn't tell me
there was a secret menu.

56:33.263 --> 56:34.864
Not her, not tonight, Charles.

56:35.825 --> 56:37.387
- Shh.
- Oh, come off it.

56:37.427 --> 56:39.149
The girls know
who you really are.

56:39.749 --> 56:40.870
We have a television.

56:41.951 --> 56:42.992
Why not?

56:43.593 --> 56:45.995
Must you be so uncouth?

56:46.035 --> 56:47.797
- Hmm?
- Do I have to say it?

56:48.638 --> 56:51.721
Not all our girls are available
on every day of the month.

56:52.362 --> 56:54.164
Oh, right, right. Of course, I--

56:56.085 --> 56:57.647
Well, I'd like her to watch.

56:57.687 --> 56:59.369
I can watch.

57:00.850 --> 57:03.133
Are you sure? You don't have to.

57:03.173 --> 57:06.136
Orla,
let the girl do what she wants.

57:10.140 --> 57:11.461
Ahh.

57:12.382 --> 57:13.423
Right.

57:15.185 --> 57:20.310
What new little toys
have we tonight?

57:21.951 --> 57:25.475
See what we've got here,
shall we?

57:27.397 --> 57:29.639
We are gonna have a lot of fun,

57:30.160 --> 57:31.601
I think, tonight.

57:33.123 --> 57:34.924
Oh, yeah.

57:37.327 --> 57:39.209
Complicated, but worth it.

57:42.932 --> 57:45.335
A little tickle.

57:47.577 --> 57:48.858
And, of course...

57:53.102 --> 57:54.544
You dirty little bitch.

57:59.269 --> 58:01.431
You're a dirty boy.

58:01.471 --> 58:03.913
Yeah, I'm a dirty boy.
Yeah, I'm a dirty boy.

58:03.953 --> 58:06.276
Get down!

58:07.036 --> 58:08.918
Get down!

58:24.974 --> 58:26.976
<i>To discuss
the situation in further detail,</i>

58:27.016 --> 58:28.738
<i>I would like to hand it
over to my colleague,</i>

58:28.778 --> 58:31.421
<i>the right honorable gentleman,
Sir Charles Ward.</i>

59:02.091 --> 59:04.814
Right.
Uh, well, uh, I should be able

59:04.854 --> 59:08.578
- to get away later in the week.
- Yeah, that's fine.

59:08.618 --> 59:10.380
You know how to book
an appointment, right?

59:10.420 --> 59:13.102
Yes, yes, yes.
Well, thanks again.

59:13.783 --> 59:14.784
Excellent.

59:54.144 --> 59:56.226
Oh. How are you
this morning, my dear?

59:56.266 --> 59:57.547
Fine.

59:57.587 --> 59:59.068
Mr. Blue isn't the best person

59:59.108 --> 01:00:00.870
to ease into this lifestyle.

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:02.792
You didn't have to
agree to anything.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.675
- I've had worse.
- Oh, you poor thing.

01:00:05.715 --> 01:00:07.277
He's known for being
a bit heavy-handed.

01:00:07.317 --> 01:00:08.758
He wasn't too rough
with you, then?

01:00:08.798 --> 01:00:09.839
I'm fine.

01:00:26.616 --> 01:00:27.657
Thank you.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.822
Last night...
Usually, he tie us up.

01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:34.464
I know.

01:00:35.024 --> 01:00:36.065
Can I stay?

01:00:47.157 --> 01:00:49.239
Do we ever go to the men,

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:52.202
or do they always come to us?

01:00:52.242 --> 01:00:54.083
Our misters come to us now.

01:00:55.605 --> 01:00:58.128
First week I here,
I go to Mr. Green...

01:00:59.529 --> 01:01:00.610
<i>but girl die.</i>

01:01:01.411 --> 01:01:02.572
What happened?

01:01:04.534 --> 01:01:06.216
There was blood everywhere.

01:01:08.338 --> 01:01:10.099
The dead girl
in Mr. Green's arms,

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.861
and he yell at me to go.

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:14.264
He say it not his fault.

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:15.865
He say it suicide.

01:01:16.786 --> 01:01:19.309
Orla believe him,
so he still come back.

01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:21.271
But no more we go to Mr. Green.

01:01:21.871 --> 01:01:23.273
No more go to anyone.

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:25.395
What was her name?

01:01:25.995 --> 01:01:27.677
I-- I don't remember.

01:01:28.678 --> 01:01:29.959
But she was white.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.801
Like you.

01:01:33.163 --> 01:01:34.844
Do you have someone
you bring over?

01:02:13.403 --> 01:02:15.885
I love it.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.421
My husband, Chyou Chiang,

01:02:32.262 --> 01:02:34.304
we have not spoke
in five months.

01:02:36.426 --> 01:02:37.867
Is that how long
you've been here?

01:02:39.229 --> 01:02:41.070
Why don't you call him?

01:02:41.511 --> 01:02:43.153
There is always excuse.

01:02:44.354 --> 01:02:45.395
Orla.

01:02:46.236 --> 01:02:47.597
I'm afraid to.

01:02:47.637 --> 01:02:49.159
You do something
she doesn't like

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:50.800
and she put you in limbo.

01:02:57.367 --> 01:02:59.289
Kat. Come sit.

01:02:59.329 --> 01:03:01.491
I've set you up
with an English bank account.

01:03:02.532 --> 01:03:04.134
Chyou, can you give us a moment?

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:07.297
She would like
to call her husband.

01:03:07.737 --> 01:03:11.341
Oh-- It's the middle
of the night there, Chyou.

01:03:11.381 --> 01:03:13.783
We'll do it later, all right?
I promise.

01:03:16.906 --> 01:03:17.947
Come. Sit.

01:03:21.471 --> 01:03:23.233
This is from last night?

01:03:23.273 --> 01:03:26.916
Uh, no, I paid a month
in advance for cleaning as well.

01:03:26.956 --> 01:03:28.678
But the rest is last night.

01:03:28.718 --> 01:03:31.040
Not as much as Chyou,
she was your main girl,

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.883
but Mr. Blue
upped his price accordingly.

01:03:34.764 --> 01:03:38.087
Now, the account is in my name,
but I do this for all my girls.

01:03:38.128 --> 01:03:39.969
Ask them. Ask Chyou.

01:03:40.009 --> 01:03:41.971
You two are
becoming fast friends.

01:03:42.572 --> 01:03:45.175
Now, the government
may not recognize it as yours,

01:03:45.215 --> 01:03:47.697
but look, the way I see it,
I only have access to it

01:03:47.737 --> 01:03:49.819
for administrative purposes.

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:52.302
I do take a portion
each month for bills,

01:03:52.342 --> 01:03:55.385
but nothing excessive,
as long as your behavior isn't.

01:03:55.425 --> 01:03:57.307
I don't want my girls
becoming freeloaders.

01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:01.951
Smile.

01:04:02.992 --> 01:04:04.434
Smile.

01:04:05.595 --> 01:04:07.237
Good.

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:08.838
<i>Facial recognition activated.</i>

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.480
Now your banking details
are all on the home screen,

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.642
so anytime you want to
access it, you just let me know.

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:16.806
Would you like to
set up a financial goal?

01:04:31.181 --> 01:04:32.222
Laundry?

01:04:54.043 --> 01:04:55.805
Everyone's got
the night off tonight.

01:04:57.407 --> 01:04:58.568
Except you, Tara.

01:04:59.209 --> 01:05:00.450
I think you'll like it.

01:05:01.571 --> 01:05:02.892
Mr. Green is visiting.

01:05:13.383 --> 01:05:14.424
Chyou.

01:05:19.229 --> 01:05:20.270
What happened?

01:05:22.432 --> 01:05:24.514
Why do we not line up
for Mr. Green?

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:28.118
He always pick Taraji.

01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:30.880
He love her.

01:05:49.139 --> 01:05:50.940
What took you so long,
my prince?

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.342
I've missed you.

01:05:53.903 --> 01:05:55.985
Next time,
don't stay away so long.

01:05:56.025 --> 01:05:57.387
Unavoidable, my dear.

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:09.679
Oh. Good evening.

01:06:11.521 --> 01:06:12.562
Oh.

01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:21.411
Mr. Green.

01:06:22.972 --> 01:06:26.256
Please do let me know
if I can ever be of...

01:06:27.056 --> 01:06:28.818
interest to you.

01:06:58.928 --> 01:07:00.250
Oh, good morning, Kat.

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.533
I'm just going to
go on a walkabout.

01:07:03.573 --> 01:07:04.894
Fancy joining me?

01:07:05.735 --> 01:07:07.417
I just need some fresh air,
you know?

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:10.300
I feel like this weather
has got us much too cooped up.

01:07:11.701 --> 01:07:13.903
- No, thank you.
- Oh, see you later.

01:07:52.542 --> 01:07:54.704
Stay away from him.

01:07:54.744 --> 01:07:56.146
Okay? He's mine.

01:07:56.186 --> 01:07:57.587
You have been
in limbo too long.

01:07:57.627 --> 01:07:59.269
He's never gonna
get you your own apartment.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:01.231
It's different with him, okay?

01:08:01.791 --> 01:08:03.153
He loves me.

01:08:03.193 --> 01:08:05.315
Then you have
nothing to worry about.

01:08:05.355 --> 01:08:07.036
It won't matter what I do.

01:08:25.855 --> 01:08:27.096
Fuck!

01:08:32.822 --> 01:08:35.225
Tara! Jesus!
What are you doing?

01:08:35.265 --> 01:08:37.587
- Stop it! Stop it!
- No! No!

01:08:37.627 --> 01:08:40.750
Peter! Peter! Help me!

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:42.952
Help me, Jesus. Stop it, Tara!

01:08:42.992 --> 01:08:45.315
- Stop it!
- No! No!

01:08:45.355 --> 01:08:47.957
- Stop it, Tara! Christ!
- No!

01:08:47.997 --> 01:08:49.879
- Peter, where are you?
- Get off of me!

01:08:49.919 --> 01:08:52.642
- Tara, stop! Tara, stop it.
- No! No!

01:08:52.682 --> 01:08:56.005
No, no! Girls!!

01:09:08.138 --> 01:09:09.619
Mr. Green has informed us

01:09:09.659 --> 01:09:11.821
he's no longer
in need of our services.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:35.285
<i>Incoming call from Orla Miller.</i>

01:09:38.087 --> 01:09:41.090
<i>Incoming call from Orla Miller.</i>

01:09:44.093 --> 01:09:45.415
<i>Incoming call from...</i>

01:09:56.706 --> 01:09:59.509
You should be able to get
at least two dozen receivers,

01:09:59.549 --> 01:10:00.950
but get more if you can.

01:11:15.545 --> 01:11:16.786
Can I stay with you?

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:22.712
Orla put Taraji in limbo again.

01:11:22.752 --> 01:11:24.514
I heard it from my room.

01:11:24.554 --> 01:11:26.636
What do you mean? Limbo?

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:28.598
Limbo.

01:11:28.638 --> 01:11:30.560
When you jump
with nowhere to go.

01:11:31.561 --> 01:11:34.003
You get stuck
'‘til Orla bring you back.

01:11:34.444 --> 01:11:36.926
First time I come,
Taraji in limbo,

01:11:36.966 --> 01:11:39.769
and every time she go,
she come back more crazy.

01:13:24.314 --> 01:13:25.795
<i>Good morning, Kat.</i>

01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:36.686
Where is my money?

01:13:36.726 --> 01:13:38.768
Receivers aren't free, silly.

01:13:38.808 --> 01:13:40.410
I'm sorry, but because of Tara,

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:41.891
we've all had to take a hit.

01:13:41.931 --> 01:13:43.253
You know, we need
to stay in business.

01:13:43.293 --> 01:13:45.175
You have enough to spare, no?

01:13:45.615 --> 01:13:47.177
That's very presumptuous of you.

01:13:48.178 --> 01:13:49.899
Receivers aren't easy
to come by, you know.

01:13:49.939 --> 01:13:51.861
You have powerful friends.

01:13:53.623 --> 01:13:55.825
Oh, you think those men
are my friends?

01:13:58.308 --> 01:13:59.909
Am I scaring you, Kat?

01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:02.232
Good.

01:14:03.553 --> 01:14:05.755
I don't need any more
of my girls giving me grief.

01:14:05.795 --> 01:14:07.397
You know,
I try my best for you all

01:14:07.437 --> 01:14:10.440
and you constantly cut your
noses off to spite your face.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.042
- Where is Taraji?
- Oh!

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:15.525
Fuck, haven't we all
had enough of her shit?

01:14:15.565 --> 01:14:18.007
I mean, the receivers,
threatening you,

01:14:18.047 --> 01:14:19.369
what she did to Marzanna.

01:14:19.409 --> 01:14:21.531
We don't know
what she did to Marzanna.

01:14:21.571 --> 01:14:22.892
Who else could have done it?

01:14:22.932 --> 01:14:24.294
You know,
no one even likes her anyway.

01:14:24.334 --> 01:14:25.935
No one trusts her.

01:14:25.975 --> 01:14:27.777
You know, the only reason
why I kept her in this house

01:14:27.817 --> 01:14:30.460
is because one of our clients
had a fetish for Black girls.

01:14:34.344 --> 01:14:35.425
You sent her away.

01:14:37.747 --> 01:14:39.028
I didn't kill her.

01:14:39.829 --> 01:14:41.911
Fuck,
you girls are unbelievable.

01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:44.714
You-- I open my house to you,

01:14:44.754 --> 01:14:47.036
I feed you, I clothe you,

01:14:47.076 --> 01:14:49.479
I set you up on your business,
and you fucking--

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:51.161
you think the worst of me!

01:14:52.162 --> 01:14:54.404
This is to protect you.

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.686
It's in case she gets loose.

01:14:57.287 --> 01:14:58.768
Jesus.

01:15:24.073 --> 01:15:25.995
Orla is lying about Mr. Green.

01:15:26.035 --> 01:15:29.078
- I think he wants to see Taraji.
- How do you know?

01:15:29.119 --> 01:15:31.561
I saw a message on Orla's pad,
but it's locked.

01:15:31.601 --> 01:15:33.603
We need to find a way
to open it.

01:15:33.643 --> 01:15:34.724
The guard.

01:15:35.685 --> 01:15:37.407
I think he is
going to get receivers.

01:15:38.648 --> 01:15:40.049
Do you trust Salima?

01:15:47.337 --> 01:15:49.139
What do you want?

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:11.641
Jesus Christ!

01:16:15.285 --> 01:16:16.646
<i>Good evening, Orla.</i>

01:16:45.915 --> 01:16:47.437
What's it like?

01:16:54.164 --> 01:16:56.045
Like the dream
where you're being chased.

01:16:59.449 --> 01:17:01.411
You move your feet,
but your feet won't move.

01:17:04.574 --> 01:17:07.096
You're-- you're thirsty,
but you can't drink.

01:17:08.418 --> 01:17:11.821
Hu-- hu-- hungry,
but you can't eat.

01:17:15.385 --> 01:17:18.868
You ha-- you have an itch,
but you can't scratch.

01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:25.115
You can't hear anything...

01:17:26.596 --> 01:17:28.278
or see anything...

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.203
or feel anything.

01:17:36.286 --> 01:17:37.527
But you're there.

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:41.411
Just waiting with...

01:17:43.733 --> 01:17:45.375
all the time in the world.

01:17:49.018 --> 01:17:52.822
Like-- like you've been
covered in stone.

01:17:59.149 --> 01:18:00.270
Mr. Green.

01:18:01.151 --> 01:18:03.032
He wants to see you.

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:06.276
Orla was lying.

01:18:07.637 --> 01:18:09.439
I think because she found out

01:18:09.479 --> 01:18:11.681
he wanted to take you away
from this place.

01:18:16.846 --> 01:18:18.208
Can he help us?

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:21.251
Where-- where is Orla?

01:18:58.368 --> 01:18:59.729
He is coming tonight.

01:19:30.079 --> 01:19:32.122
No, no, no! No, no!

01:19:36.446 --> 01:19:37.767
Hey, what do you want?

01:19:38.968 --> 01:19:40.490
We go England.

01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:42.132
You're not both
going tonight, darling.

01:19:42.172 --> 01:19:43.853
Not on my dime, all right?

01:19:43.893 --> 01:19:46.856
So, if England it is,
which one of you two are going?

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.622
The sooner you leave,
the safer you'll be.

01:19:52.662 --> 01:19:55.185
I can hide better than you.

01:19:55.225 --> 01:19:56.946
They know who you are,
because of your father

01:19:56.986 --> 01:19:58.308
and the people you clean for.

01:19:58.908 --> 01:20:01.591
If they find you,
you are not getting out of here.

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:03.993
You need to leave
while you still have a chance.

01:20:05.074 --> 01:20:07.397
- You jump us both across border.
- And then what?

01:20:08.158 --> 01:20:09.999
There's nothing for us there.

01:20:12.282 --> 01:20:14.564
She jumps to England.

01:20:14.604 --> 01:20:15.645
You can do it.

01:20:17.407 --> 01:20:19.008
I believe in you.

01:20:27.457 --> 01:20:30.180
I couldn't go,
even if I wanted to.

01:20:31.461 --> 01:20:33.823
Fucking hell! You were gonna
let me jump you like that?

01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:39.549
I need to heal before I can go.

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:41.911
You'll do fine.

01:20:42.712 --> 01:20:44.954
Practice English
until we say goodbye.

01:20:51.401 --> 01:20:54.684
Orla Miller!
Hey, babes, you all right?

01:20:54.724 --> 01:20:57.607
<i>Vas. It must be late there.</i>

01:20:57.647 --> 01:21:00.850
Yeah, you know how it is.
No rest for the wicked.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:03.293
Look, I know it's unscheduled,
but you've got, uh,

01:21:03.333 --> 01:21:05.415
capacity for a jump
coming your way tonight?

01:21:06.216 --> 01:21:07.817
<i>Oh, you poor thing.</i>

01:21:07.857 --> 01:21:09.619
Yeah, she, uh,
she needs to raise some funds

01:21:09.659 --> 01:21:11.901
and hopefully bring over
a friend in a few months' time.

01:21:11.941 --> 01:21:13.543
I told her you might be able
to sponsor a stay

01:21:13.583 --> 01:21:15.104
at your safe house.

01:21:15.145 --> 01:21:17.507
<i>Yeah, absolutely.
You remember Mr. Green?</i>

01:21:17.987 --> 01:21:20.830
<i>Well, a generous donation came
in from him just this morning.</i>

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:22.512
Fantastic.

01:21:22.552 --> 01:21:24.394
All right, I'll send 'em over.

01:21:24.434 --> 01:21:26.676
Give 'em a good spank when they
get there, all right, darling?

01:21:28.958 --> 01:21:30.360
Ah, there she is.

01:21:31.361 --> 01:21:32.762
Fuck yeah.

01:21:45.495 --> 01:21:48.978
Ready...
let us do the job.

01:21:49.018 --> 01:21:50.420
All right.

01:21:55.104 --> 01:21:56.146
All right.

01:22:01.191 --> 01:22:03.753
Okay.

01:22:03.793 --> 01:22:05.235
All right. Ready?

01:22:06.476 --> 01:22:08.678
Let's get you in the machine.
Come on.

01:22:08.718 --> 01:22:10.960
Off we go. In you get.

01:22:13.203 --> 01:22:15.325
Okay, just stand there for me.
That's it. Lovely.

01:22:15.365 --> 01:22:18.568
Stay inside the safe zone.
Brilliant. Okay.

01:22:18.608 --> 01:22:20.290
Let's get this going on, then.

01:22:27.697 --> 01:22:30.300
Uh, missy.
You wanna keep them toes,

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.262
or you wanna leave 'em
behind as mementos?

01:22:32.302 --> 01:22:34.103
Memen-toes, get it?

01:22:48.198 --> 01:22:49.999
I'll be right behind you.

01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:53.683
Today, ladies.

01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:11.060
Now,
when you get on the other side,

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.143
you're gonna feel
a bit out of sorts.

01:23:13.183 --> 01:23:14.864
A bit like someone's
punched you in the gut.

01:23:15.305 --> 01:23:16.346
All right?

01:23:17.627 --> 01:23:18.868
Does she understand
what I'm saying?

01:23:18.908 --> 01:23:20.150
I understand.

01:23:23.713 --> 01:23:24.994
All right, okay.

01:23:28.037 --> 01:23:29.279
Bosh.

01:23:34.844 --> 01:23:36.886
Look at that go.

01:23:37.487 --> 01:23:38.888
That's a piece of art, ladies.

01:23:55.785 --> 01:23:57.187
Here it goes.

01:24:03.673 --> 01:24:05.315
That's right, ladies.

01:24:09.319 --> 01:24:12.162
And... beautiful!
Look at that. Ah!

01:24:12.922 --> 01:24:15.325
Fucking amazing.

01:24:33.383 --> 01:24:35.465
Oh, dear, you poor thing.

01:24:35.505 --> 01:24:36.866
I'll get you some water.

01:24:49.159 --> 01:24:52.522
Is this who you saw
in Mr. Green's bedroom?

01:25:19.749 --> 01:25:20.830
That her.

01:25:31.521 --> 01:25:33.243
I bet you're loving this.

01:25:44.494 --> 01:25:46.416
Just get it over with already.

01:26:21.931 --> 01:26:24.614
Whoa! Easy, easy.

01:26:26.576 --> 01:26:28.458
What happened to your face?

01:26:32.382 --> 01:26:33.783
What are you doing?

01:26:33.823 --> 01:26:35.104
Where is Orla?

01:26:37.787 --> 01:26:40.830
Look, they need your help too.

01:26:41.951 --> 01:26:43.193
Look,
I-- I was under the impression

01:26:43.233 --> 01:26:44.474
that you were all
very happy here.

01:26:44.514 --> 01:26:45.555
Were you?

01:26:46.236 --> 01:26:47.277
Of course!

01:26:48.358 --> 01:26:50.200
I have never done
anything like that.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.682
I've always treated
Taraji with respect.

01:26:52.722 --> 01:26:55.285
How many girls
have you treated with respect?

01:27:03.733 --> 01:27:05.775
No, it's not--
it's not what you think.

01:27:05.815 --> 01:27:07.217
It-- it isn't what you think.

01:27:20.029 --> 01:27:21.951
Oh!

01:27:22.832 --> 01:27:24.274
Oh, I thought-- Ah.

01:27:25.275 --> 01:27:27.517
I don't think I can bear to
think of you with anyone else.

01:27:33.163 --> 01:27:36.566
What if I got you
a place of your own?

01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:42.252
Oh, God.

01:27:44.414 --> 01:27:46.496
I want to talk to Anya!

01:27:47.777 --> 01:27:51.941
I trust you!
I want to talk to Anya.

01:27:51.981 --> 01:27:53.663
You said I could call her.

01:27:56.746 --> 01:27:58.588
<i>Please, please.</i>

01:27:58.628 --> 01:27:59.949
<i>It's not safe here.</i>

01:27:59.989 --> 01:28:02.272
<i>Please. Please.</i>

01:28:02.312 --> 01:28:05.555
<i>Please.
You need to-- to get me back.</i>

01:28:06.796 --> 01:28:08.278
You fucking--

01:28:25.815 --> 01:28:27.937
Oh! What have I done?

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.482
<i>Please, please.</i>

01:29:32.522 --> 01:29:34.644
<i>You need to--
you need to get me back.</i>

01:29:34.684 --> 01:29:38.047
<i>Please. Please.
It's not safe here.</i>

01:29:38.087 --> 01:29:39.569
<i>Please.</i>

01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:42.572
<i>You need to-- to get me back.</i>

01:30:03.072 --> 01:30:04.554
Richard wouldn't do that.

01:30:04.594 --> 01:30:06.676
- He wouldn't hurt anyone.
- Of course not.

01:30:06.716 --> 01:30:09.479
I see you.
I see blood everywhere.

01:30:09.519 --> 01:30:10.800
I did what I could for her.

01:30:11.801 --> 01:30:13.683
She might still be alive.

01:30:18.488 --> 01:30:20.210
Hey! Watch it.

01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:21.291
What?

01:30:22.011 --> 01:30:23.653
You know,
you shouldn't get so possessive.

01:30:24.214 --> 01:30:26.376
It's not like she cares
who's fingering her arse.

01:30:26.416 --> 01:30:28.017
It's just a pay packet.

01:30:28.057 --> 01:30:29.459
You are unbelievable.

01:30:29.979 --> 01:30:31.901
Oh, am I?

01:30:33.102 --> 01:30:35.265
And you'd still be
crying into a pint

01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:37.267
about your sexless marriage

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:39.068
if I hadn't introduced you to...

01:30:40.069 --> 01:30:42.552
Orla's lovely girls.

01:30:43.233 --> 01:30:44.394
Hey, Chyou-Chyou.

01:30:46.436 --> 01:30:48.118
Oh, you smell good.

01:30:48.158 --> 01:30:50.360
Lay a finger on her again,
and I will fucking kill you.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.881
Oh, big man.

01:30:51.921 --> 01:30:54.083
That would be quite the scandal,
wouldn't it?

01:30:54.124 --> 01:30:57.207
Oh, you f--

01:30:57.247 --> 01:30:59.889
Jesus Christ,
Richard, you fucking prick.

01:30:59.929 --> 01:31:02.772
She's a whore!
Not your fucking daughter!

01:31:02.812 --> 01:31:04.374
Fucking hell. Ow.

01:31:04.414 --> 01:31:07.337
Let me go.

01:31:15.385 --> 01:31:16.426
What happened?

01:31:17.467 --> 01:31:18.748
I didn't mean to hurt her.

01:31:18.788 --> 01:31:20.230
- I didn't, I didn't.
- Who?

01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:22.392
Who-- who have you hurt?
Charles?

01:31:27.237 --> 01:31:28.838
Oh. Oh...

01:31:34.924 --> 01:31:36.446
Oh, my God, Charles.
What happened?

01:31:38.408 --> 01:31:39.649
We need to help her!

01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:42.011
Oh, my love.

01:31:42.051 --> 01:31:43.933
What has he done?

01:32:27.257 --> 01:32:29.339
<i>All I could think of
was the scandal.</i>

01:32:29.379 --> 01:32:31.381
I almost lost everything,
you know.

01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:33.223
They almost
traced it back to me.

01:32:34.144 --> 01:32:35.385
It wasn't my fault.

01:32:35.945 --> 01:32:37.627
I didn't have to help her,
but I did.

01:32:38.748 --> 01:32:39.789
I did!

01:32:43.393 --> 01:32:44.754
Did Anya survive?

01:32:45.875 --> 01:32:47.157
How am I supposed to know that?

01:32:48.598 --> 01:32:51.201
- I'd like-- I'd like to leave.
- Will you help us?

01:32:52.362 --> 01:32:53.843
I can't do anything.

01:32:54.604 --> 01:32:57.647
- Oh, God. I'd like to leave.
- Please. Help us!

01:32:57.687 --> 01:33:00.450
Let me out of here!

01:33:05.455 --> 01:33:07.657
Where is Orla?
What have you done with her?

01:33:07.697 --> 01:33:08.978
Where is she?

01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.222
What did you do?

01:33:13.503 --> 01:33:16.466
Just stay back.
All of you, just stay back!

01:33:23.072 --> 01:33:24.314
What the fuck?

01:34:11.121 --> 01:34:12.642
Into the pod.

01:34:12.682 --> 01:34:15.125
One at a time. You first, Tara.

01:34:35.345 --> 01:34:37.066
Look at you.

01:34:38.228 --> 01:34:41.751
No one's ever gonna wanna
fuck your infested cunt now.

01:34:41.791 --> 01:34:43.873
Not even for free,
let alone for money.

01:34:44.954 --> 01:34:47.837
I wasted my time
putting you into limbo.

01:34:47.877 --> 01:34:50.120
You've just--
you learned-- learned nothing.

01:34:53.163 --> 01:34:55.285
It's funny how the world
comes full circle.

01:34:56.366 --> 01:34:59.489
You worked so hard to come here,
and now I'm just

01:34:59.529 --> 01:35:01.211
sending you right back
to where you came from.

01:35:02.172 --> 01:35:04.894
I might just spare you and
send you to the ocean instead.

01:35:07.817 --> 01:35:09.139
Receivers sink, by the way.

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.581
Do you know what the pressure

01:35:11.621 --> 01:35:13.143
at the bottom of the ocean
does to a body?

01:35:23.873 --> 01:35:25.115
Get off me!

01:37:37.967 --> 01:37:39.209
Ekaterina.
