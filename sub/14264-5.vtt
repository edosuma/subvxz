[ Leonardo ]
Hey, where's Michelangelo?

13:42.387 --> 13:45.255
Oh, no, don't tell me
it squashed him.

13:45.323 --> 13:49.760
[ Groans ]
That was heavy, dudes.
Really heavy.

13:49.827 --> 13:53.664
We've got less than two hours
before the time paradox
erases us.

13:53.732 --> 13:56.600
Yeah, and about two seconds
before the next
attack monster...

13:56.668 --> 13:59.103
turns us into
the <i> Cream</i> Machine.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.878
[ Leonardo ]
We're pinned down.

14:07.946 --> 14:10.648
I've got to get
to the targeting computer...

14:10.716 --> 14:12.516
before Dregg gets that chip.

14:12.584 --> 14:15.552
There's the chip!

14:16.721 --> 14:18.456
And I've got it.

14:18.523 --> 14:20.857
Stop!
Or Krang is finished.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.563
Uh, guys,
I think
he's got me.

14:26.631 --> 14:31.468
Mung, put this chip
into the transporter
targeting computer.

14:32.804 --> 14:35.239
My invasion
is no longer necessary,

14:35.307 --> 14:40.844
now that I can transport
pieces of the sun to all of
Earth's major cities.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.881
[ Carter ]
No!

14:56.427 --> 14:59.896
Another of your cities
has just been annihilated.

14:59.964 --> 15:01.598
Have you gone wacko, Dregg?

15:01.666 --> 15:03.501
You're mad!

15:03.568 --> 15:05.536
You may call me mad,

15:05.604 --> 15:09.940
but in a few minutes
you'll be calling me
Emperor of the World!

15:10.008 --> 15:11.708
[ Cackles ]

15:24.923 --> 15:28.091
It's a good thing
we got these
buildings evacuated.

15:28.159 --> 15:31.962
If we can get
to the top floor in time,
we may have a chance.

15:32.030 --> 15:35.899
[ Grunts ]
Yeah. To see the sights
one last time!

15:39.337 --> 15:40.738
[ Elevator Bell Dings ]

15:40.806 --> 15:43.407
Okay, guys,
just do what I told you.

15:46.978 --> 15:49.246
Everyone, down!

15:49.314 --> 15:51.715
Michelangelo, go!

16:05.163 --> 16:07.964
[ Donatello ]
I'm not sure I know
how to operate this thing.

16:08.032 --> 16:09.433
No sweat, dude.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.770
It's just like my rock-'em,
sock-'em ninja video game.

16:12.837 --> 16:16.206
Come on.
We've gotta get back
to the nuclear power plant.

16:23.514 --> 16:27.217
Mung, get me
the League of Nations.

16:27.285 --> 16:30.687
[ Mung ]
Oh! Yes, my lord.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.891
<i>This is a confidential</i>
<i>satellite channel.</i>

16:33.959 --> 16:36.026
<i>What is the meaning</i>
<i>of this interruption?</i>

16:36.094 --> 16:40.364
Well, you see,
I've already destroyed
a dozen major cities.

16:40.432 --> 16:45.069
I demand the unconditional
surrender of all nations,

16:45.137 --> 16:49.339
or I shall turn the Earth
into a boiling sun.

16:49.407 --> 16:52.376
The League of Nations
does not respond to threats.

16:52.444 --> 16:54.945
Especially false ones.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.746
False threats!

16:56.814 --> 16:58.815
Is he out of his mind?

16:58.883 --> 17:02.319
Losing your evil touch,
huh, Dregg?

17:03.655 --> 17:05.555
It's true, my lord.

17:05.623 --> 17:09.259
Scanners indicate
that all of the planet's
capitals are...

17:09.327 --> 17:10.727
intact.

17:10.795 --> 17:12.429
But-But--
But how?

17:12.497 --> 17:13.997
Oh, it was simple, really.

17:14.065 --> 17:16.532
I just bypassed your
subspace targeting chip...

17:16.601 --> 17:19.603
and programmed your computer
to run your
virtual reality tests.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.637
You've been watching
reruns, dude.

17:21.705 --> 17:23.874
And you are going to watch me...

17:23.942 --> 17:27.678
put an end
to your Earthly existence.

17:32.850 --> 17:35.586
All right, guys.
Let's drop that rat!

17:44.062 --> 17:46.363
Quickly, dismantle
that... thing.

17:52.437 --> 17:54.304
[ Clinking ]

17:57.542 --> 18:00.010
This thing is coming apart.

18:00.077 --> 18:02.646
They just don't make
alien invasion craft
like they used to.

18:02.814 --> 18:03.880
[ Clanging, Crashing ]

18:05.550 --> 18:08.552
[ Screaming ]

18:13.925 --> 18:16.293
What on earth?
[ Groans ]

18:16.361 --> 18:19.363
My brain energy
must be malfunctioning.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.132
No, your brain
is working perfectly.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.701
The Turtles have brought
their duplicates...

18:24.769 --> 18:26.403
from the past
to destroy you.

18:26.471 --> 18:30.006
And destroy you they will!
No!

18:30.809 --> 18:34.311
Turtles to the second power!

18:34.378 --> 18:38.482
If we survive this,
I'll deal with you, Dregg.

18:49.761 --> 18:52.429
[ Together ]
Hey, have you seen
my yo-yo move, dude?

18:56.267 --> 18:58.101
[ Together ]
Guess I already
taught it to you, huh?

18:59.737 --> 19:03.106
Quick.
We've gotta reprogram
the targeting computer...

19:03.174 --> 19:06.076
and transport
the attack monsters
to a distant asteroid.

19:06.978 --> 19:09.012
[ Together ]
Fire!

19:24.629 --> 19:26.463
[ Together ]
Whoa!

19:26.531 --> 19:30.367
Mung, lock on to the sunspots
and transport them to Earth.

19:32.803 --> 19:34.438
Ready, my lord.

19:36.274 --> 19:38.475
No!

19:41.346 --> 19:45.282
Mung, transport... now!

19:50.889 --> 19:53.757
[ Grunts ]
Let me... go!

19:56.561 --> 19:59.996
- [ Beeps ]
- Transporter activated!

20:00.064 --> 20:02.199
[ Groans ]
It's too late.

20:02.266 --> 20:04.234
The Earth is doomed.

20:04.302 --> 20:06.370
Well, guess again, Dregg.

20:06.437 --> 20:09.005
I retargeted the transporter.

20:13.778 --> 20:16.580
Your starship is stardust.

20:19.350 --> 20:22.051
[ Grunts ]
What's happening?

20:22.119 --> 20:23.787
What <i> is</i> happening?

20:23.855 --> 20:27.791
When the transporter platform
in Dregg's ship exploded,

20:27.858 --> 20:29.926
it must have overloaded
<i>this</i> platform.

20:29.994 --> 20:32.763
Oh, this whole place
is gonna blow any second.

20:32.831 --> 20:36.132
Then we've gotta get rid
of these bad guys-- and fast.

20:36.200 --> 20:40.103
Excuse me.
I believe you stole
some Turtle power from us.

20:41.839 --> 20:43.340
Stop!

20:45.076 --> 20:47.210
Get them on the platform!
Hurry!

20:55.353 --> 20:58.254
- [ Beeps ]
- Transporter activated.

20:58.322 --> 21:02.259
[ Dregg ]
I won't go back!

21:04.028 --> 21:06.162
Hurry!
It's gonna blow!

21:13.438 --> 21:15.405
We saved you, dudes.

21:15.473 --> 21:17.674
No way, dude.
We saved <i> you.</i>

21:17.742 --> 21:21.845
Hold it.
Let's compromise.
We saved ourselves.

21:21.913 --> 21:23.914
Okay.
Hard to argue with that.

21:23.982 --> 21:27.217
Uh, guys.
I don't think
we saved anyone.

21:27.285 --> 21:30.120
- [ Beeping ]
- We've only got 10 seconds
before we all vanish...

21:30.187 --> 21:31.788
into the time warp paradox.

21:31.856 --> 21:35.225
It's, uh--
It's been nice
knowing you guys.

21:38.062 --> 21:40.163
There isn't a second
to spare.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.834
Did they...
make it in time?

21:44.902 --> 21:46.503
They're back
where they belong,

21:46.570 --> 21:49.139
safely fighting
Shredder and Krang
in the past.

21:49.207 --> 21:52.442
Great!
I guess.

21:52.509 --> 21:55.578
Yeah, but we never
got a chance to say good-bye.

21:55.646 --> 21:58.048
Well, that's okay.
We know what
they would have said.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.917
Huh.
Yeah, that's true.
They're us.

22:00.985 --> 22:03.420
So we could just
say good-bye to ourselves.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.989
<i>¡Hasta la vista,</i> Michelangelo!

22:06.057 --> 22:08.459
Later, dude.
It was cool meeting you.

22:08.526 --> 22:11.828
I think he's missing
a few beans
in the old burrito.

22:11.896 --> 22:15.599
Now that Dregg is gone, I--
Well, I guess this is
as good a time as any...

22:15.666 --> 22:19.436
for me to go back to school
and see if I can find a cure
for my mutation.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.404
Come with us
to the future, Carter.

22:21.472 --> 22:23.339
We have scientists there
who can cure you.

22:23.407 --> 22:25.541
The future? Huh.
[ Chuckles ]

22:25.609 --> 22:28.011
I never really thought about it,
but it sounds pretty cool.

22:28.079 --> 22:30.713
[ Sighs ]
Maybe it's a good idea.

22:30.781 --> 22:33.182
We don't seem to be able
to cure you here.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.885
Yeah. Go for it,
Carter.

22:35.953 --> 22:39.289
Yeah, dude.
But, uh, do us one favor.

22:39.357 --> 22:43.026
Please, don't bring any
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
back from the future.

22:43.094 --> 22:44.828
Four is plenty.

22:44.895 --> 22:46.696
[ Chuckles ]
Right.

22:48.565 --> 22:50.533
Well, see ya
in the future, guys.
