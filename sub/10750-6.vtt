00:17.544 --> 00:18.630
You there!

00:18.977 --> 00:20.286
Blind, wizened man.

00:20.628 --> 00:24.456
I have come from a faraway place
to seek a great sorcerer.

00:25.189 --> 00:26.443
I am whom you seek.

00:26.753 --> 00:29.032
You?
You're nothing

00:29.359 --> 00:33.315
but an old man in rags
playing hoopaloo with the wind.

00:34.285 --> 00:35.539
You wish for proof.

00:35.581 --> 00:36.603
Aye.

00:38.021 --> 00:39.069
Pick a card.

00:40.785 --> 00:42.003
Don't tell me.

00:42.462 --> 00:44.046
Put it back in the pack.

00:47.952 --> 00:49.140
Is this your card?

00:49.822 --> 00:51.620
No, but damn close.

00:51.777 --> 00:53.376
You are the man I seek.

00:54.031 --> 00:56.297
Come, sit. Tell me a tale.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.007
It is a woman.

00:59.076 --> 01:00.674
It is always a woman.

01:01.045 --> 01:04.870
Her sweet voice
wakes a mighty tiger behind my fly.

01:05.172 --> 01:07.680
Yet she is proud
and will not have me.

01:08.019 --> 01:10.989
Her name is Jane or Jan
or something similar.

01:11.227 --> 01:13.165
You would have her to your bed,
would you?

01:13.205 --> 01:15.590
Aye. A thousand times, aye.

01:17.051 --> 01:18.826
Take this tinc…

01:19.278 --> 01:20.352
tincture,

01:20.509 --> 01:22.093
and put it in her drink.

01:22.317 --> 01:24.905
She'll be yours within moments.

01:26.634 --> 01:28.990
Thank you.
I will use it well.

01:31.519 --> 01:32.587
What's that for?

01:32.841 --> 01:34.362
Sorry, it was an accident.

01:34.402 --> 01:36.089
What did you do that for⁈

01:36.264 --> 01:37.835
Like I say, it was an accident.

01:37.875 --> 01:40.536
–It was full of coins!
–All right! I've apologised once.

01:40.576 --> 01:42.556
That was a stupid thing to do!

01:42.655 --> 01:44.477
You could have caught it, you idiot.

01:44.517 --> 01:48.873
–That was a stupid thing to do!
–I have no time for this bullshit.

02:11.194 --> 02:13.834

02:23.713 --> 02:25.693
–What level is this?
–Shut up!

02:39.775 --> 02:42.081
–Oh, my God!
–Woo!

02:42.272 --> 02:43.801
–That was perfect!
–I rock!

02:43.841 --> 02:46.547
Didn't miss a note.
I am wasting my life.

02:46.551 --> 02:47.937
I am wasting my life.

02:48.044 --> 02:49.056
How?

02:49.213 --> 02:51.210
Why am I so good at this?

02:51.394 --> 02:53.636
What, am I gonna put this on my CV?

02:53.676 --> 02:57.004
–Can't something just be fun?
–Oh, no, put it away, please.

02:57.044 --> 03:00.080
But I've got a big gig coming up.
Put it away.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.392
–All right, Yoko.
–Oh, God.

03:04.175 --> 03:06.912
Are you still in the same
clothes as yesterday?

03:06.952 --> 03:10.186
I, er, may have met a lady
in the pub last night.

03:10.188 --> 03:11.236
Oh, yeah?

03:11.393 --> 03:14.614
Oh, yes,
it was quite a memorable evening.

03:15.172 --> 03:16.374
Good for you.

03:19.004 --> 03:20.236
Oh, Stephanie, hi.

03:21.672 --> 03:23.322
Oh, God. Right, OK, yeah.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.692
I'll send him right…
I'll be right up. Bye.

03:26.732 --> 03:27.753
Douglas again?

03:28.140 --> 03:32.397
Yeah. He keeps bringing me up
on these flimsy pretexts.

03:32.832 --> 03:35.736
The other day,
it was to show me a dead fly.

03:42.227 --> 03:43.275
Fly!

03:45.953 --> 03:48.527
Yeah, it's getting
a little ridiculous.

03:52.209 --> 03:54.318
Wait until I tell you
what happened last night.

03:54.358 --> 03:56.681
Wait till I tell you
what's just happened to me.

03:56.721 --> 03:58.909
I bought this muffin from the
canteen,

03:58.949 --> 04:02.777
and I'll be Jolly Rogered
if there's not hyperoside in it.

04:03.097 --> 04:07.057
Curium. Ebrium. And unless
I'm going crazy, that's selenium.

04:07.836 --> 04:12.654
It's definitely hyperoside, and it's
not listed in the table of contents.

04:16.595 --> 04:18.113
That was a great story.

04:19.777 --> 04:22.016
You remember the woman
from last night?

04:22.055 --> 04:24.106
She seemed lovely, right?

04:24.368 --> 04:25.556
She was a delight.

04:25.734 --> 04:27.160
Yeah. We get outside,

04:27.356 --> 04:31.205
there was a group of tramps,
two of whom she knows by name.

04:31.245 --> 04:33.159
She starts screaming at them,

04:34.043 --> 04:38.343
“You owe me money!” She thinks
that the tramps owe her money.

04:39.181 --> 04:41.316
Next thing I know, it all kicks off.

04:41.356 --> 04:44.133
I'm running for my life.
It was a horrible evening, Moss,

04:44.173 --> 04:47.275
a horrible evening,
and she's a horrible woman.

04:48.601 --> 04:50.581
Right… But you slept with her?

05:03.287 --> 05:04.990
I've been expecting you.

05:05.881 --> 05:07.465
You asked me to come up.

05:09.007 --> 05:11.899
Which is why
I've been expecting you.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.365
Anyway, I'm glad
we've got that cleared up.

05:15.405 --> 05:17.488
I've got a lot of
important papers to look over,

05:17.528 --> 05:18.917
so if you don't mind…

05:21.707 --> 05:22.729
What, leave?

05:23.358 --> 05:24.497
Yes, please.

05:27.563 --> 05:28.794
I like you, Jen.

05:29.507 --> 05:31.091
You don't ask questions.

05:31.710 --> 05:34.490
A lot of people would be confused
as to why I invited them up,

05:34.530 --> 05:36.774
then asked them to leave. Not you.

05:37.239 --> 05:41.463
A person needs a lot of backbone
to be ordered around like that.

05:42.192 --> 05:44.603
You've got spunk and balls.

05:46.173 --> 05:47.955
And I like that in a woman.

05:49.791 --> 05:50.813
Thank you.

05:50.944 --> 05:53.584
Which is why
I'd like you to be my P. A.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.110
–Really?
–Yes. Stephanie's leaving.

05:56.227 --> 05:58.139
Definitely?
No, Stephanie.

05:59.170 --> 06:00.754
Come sit on my big hand.

06:03.159 --> 06:05.254
It's a huge pay rise,
a chance

06:05.568 --> 06:09.462
of wonderful opportunities.
you'd be crazy to pass up. Sex.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.533
–What?
–What?

06:13.188 --> 06:14.574
Did you just say sex?

06:15.161 --> 06:17.723
I don't think so. Come on, Jen!

06:18.066 --> 06:19.686
I need your mind on the job,

06:19.726 --> 06:22.432
not thinking about
sexy sex all the time.

06:23.001 --> 06:26.500
It's true, I have been accused
of sexy shenanigans

06:26.710 --> 06:28.558
against my female employees.

06:28.668 --> 06:30.192
Yes, there's that court case.

06:30.232 --> 06:31.816
Yeah, but she'll settle.

06:32.013 --> 06:34.653
That was the old me.
This is the new me.

06:34.704 --> 06:36.507
And I want you to be a part of it.

06:36.547 --> 06:38.273
A part of me. Sex…

06:50.268 --> 06:52.180
Moss, I've got something to tell you.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.871
Oh, my God!

06:55.323 --> 06:57.633
–Wait 'till I tell you.
–Ah, sorry.

06:58.102 --> 07:00.000
Where's Roy? He should be here.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.206
Before you begin,

07:01.389 --> 07:04.650
I should say that
I have problems processing big news.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.871
Douglas has asked me to be his P. A.

07:08.342 --> 07:09.902
Oh, my God!

07:11.055 --> 07:12.303
His P. A.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.323
Oh… my… God!

07:16.967 --> 07:18.945
That is something and a half.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.833
His P. A.
How?

07:24.991 --> 07:27.237
His… Shut up! His P. A!

07:27.892 --> 07:29.740
It means personal assistant.

07:29.749 --> 07:30.876
Thank you.

07:32.499 --> 07:35.337
Right. OK.
What does that actually involve?

07:35.355 --> 07:38.625
Oh, picking up his mail,
going to the supermarket for him,

07:38.665 --> 07:39.909
getting his washing.

07:39.949 --> 07:43.119
I have to say, Moss,
it's a real step up.

07:43.779 --> 07:46.071
How are you going to do that
and work here?

07:46.111 --> 07:49.566
That's the thing.
He wants me to quit the department.

07:49.606 --> 07:51.589
You're not going to do it, are you?

07:51.629 --> 07:53.356
Well, there's a huge pay rise.

07:53.396 --> 07:54.771
Phew. So, no?

07:55.341 --> 07:56.862
No, I probably am.

07:57.153 --> 07:58.707
But what about the pay rise?

07:58.747 --> 08:00.331
–That's if I go.
–Right.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.839
He's not paying me more to stay here.

08:04.897 --> 08:07.182
Of course not, that'd be ridiculous.

08:07.222 --> 08:09.173
So, am I getting a pay rise?

08:09.973 --> 08:11.887
Why would you get a pay rise?

08:12.071 --> 08:13.853
OK, let's just start again.

08:14.744 --> 08:18.019
Douglas wants me to be your P. A?

08:18.232 --> 08:19.358
No!

08:19.555 --> 08:23.068
–Then why am I getting a pay rise?
–Whoa, why is he getting a pay rise?

08:23.108 --> 08:24.824
Jen wants me to be her PA.

08:24.915 --> 08:28.479
Where did you get this?
It's Douglas who wants a P. A.

08:28.531 --> 08:30.775
I don't want to be Douglas's P. A.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.823
He's not really qualified, Jen.

08:33.188 --> 08:36.423
Do you even have the authority
to offer me a pay rise?

08:36.462 --> 08:38.047
I don't want you to be my P. A.

08:38.087 --> 08:41.128
It's Douglas who wants me
to be his P. A. That's it.

08:41.168 --> 08:42.488
That's all there is.

08:42.504 --> 08:45.408
You don't come into it,
you're not involved.

08:45.833 --> 08:47.196
Who's Douglas?

08:48.663 --> 08:50.744
So, Douglas wants you to be his P. A?

08:50.784 --> 08:52.566
–Yes.
–Are you gonna do it?

08:53.142 --> 08:55.716
I dunno, it's an opportunity,
you know?

08:56.246 --> 08:58.358
Yeah. You should probably do it.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.890
I mean, you don't
want to be stuck down here

09:01.930 --> 09:03.933
for the rest of your life
playing Guitar Hero.

09:03.973 --> 09:07.144
Exactly. Exactly.
Yeah, I think I'll say yes.

09:07.275 --> 09:08.910
I think I have to.

09:09.854 --> 09:13.352
You guys will probably be glad
to see the back of me.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.787
Wow, you're gonna let that hang there.

09:17.827 --> 09:20.137
No, I'm joking. Of course we won't.

09:23.459 --> 09:24.783
Oh, for f… OK.

09:26.444 --> 09:28.829
OK, could you stop shouting at me?

09:29.498 --> 09:32.835
OK, stop shouting at me.
I told you not to call me at work.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.779
How are you drunk again?
It's not even noon.

09:35.796 --> 09:38.730
Who is this?
Yeah, yeah. This is his wife.

09:38.887 --> 09:40.801
Please don't call here again.

09:43.220 --> 09:45.728
Yep. What are you
gonna do without me?

09:49.991 --> 09:54.280
You know that list of things we're
not allowed to do when Jen's here?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.564
I think it's time for a print-out.

10:06.391 --> 10:08.113
Oh, my word.

10:08.726 --> 10:10.508
Oh, God.

10:12.335 --> 10:14.064
Oh, bloody hell!

10:16.553 --> 10:17.680
This is amazing!

10:19.940 --> 10:21.328
Get in!

10:22.560 --> 10:24.606
Welcome to the 30th floor, Jen.

10:24.821 --> 10:26.000
Come with me.

10:26.865 --> 10:28.647
I wanna show you something.

10:36.098 --> 10:37.199
Two of them now!

10:37.435 --> 10:38.719
Yes.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.149
Do you want me to get rid of them?

10:42.928 --> 10:46.360
Ten minutes in and you've
already paid for yourself.

12:10.812 --> 12:13.663
So, Terry can do
squash on the Tuesday.

12:13.826 --> 12:15.674
Lucinda says she can't wait.

12:15.814 --> 12:20.038
And Chessington World of Adventures
say they're very sorry, but…

12:20.236 --> 12:21.820
you're not allowed back.

12:23.262 --> 12:24.309
Whatever.

12:26.783 --> 12:30.726
How long have you been working for me
now, Jen? Three, four months, is it?

12:30.766 --> 12:32.812
Well, no, it's just been today.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.274
You're right.
We went jogging,

12:35.321 --> 12:37.037
I knackered that squirrel,

12:37.055 --> 12:38.639
the hand thing happened.

12:39.334 --> 12:40.592
Feels longer.

12:41.404 --> 12:44.308
Feels like we've built up
a, er, connection.

12:44.534 --> 12:46.683
Yes, yes, a business connection.

12:47.023 --> 12:49.333
Yeah, yeah. More than that, though.

12:49.798 --> 12:51.239
No, I don't think so.

12:51.606 --> 12:56.035
Well, I feel like.
Know what I mean?

12:56.905 --> 12:58.896
I do and I disagree.

12:59.630 --> 13:01.674
Anyway, these came back today.

13:01.857 --> 13:05.446
Come on, Jen!
Ever feel like just having some fun?

13:06.730 --> 13:09.276
Mr Reynholm, I am a professional.

13:09.958 --> 13:11.542
I take my job seriously.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.845
And if I wasn't able to do it properly,

13:13.885 --> 13:15.694
I'd be letting myself and you down.

13:15.734 --> 13:19.664
So, please, either let me
do my job or let me go.

13:20.704 --> 13:23.414
Anyway, these came back today
and they said they've done their

13:23.454 --> 13:26.952
very best but some of
the stains just won't come out.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.531
Good God.

13:30.835 --> 13:33.343
You looked exactly
like Melissa there.

13:33.756 --> 13:34.935
Melissa?

13:35.328 --> 13:37.477
My wife. She died.

13:38.866 --> 13:40.846
Oh, poor you. That's terrible.

13:41.060 --> 13:44.624
There's not a day goes past
that I don't think of her.

13:48.075 --> 13:50.451
I'll never forget
our final moments.

13:50.957 --> 13:54.131
<i>Help me!
My husband's trying to kill me!</i>

13:56.174 --> 13:58.956
Oh, oh, I'm so, so sorry.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.079
–Would you do me a favour?
–What?

14:03.119 --> 14:06.815
I want to feel like Melissa
is alive just one last time.

14:09.525 --> 14:11.444
Here's a selection of her lingerie.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.663
Oh, Mr Reynholm!

14:12.899 --> 14:15.143
Please dress as my sexy dead wife!

14:15.178 --> 14:16.883
Oh, this isn't working out.

14:16.923 --> 14:20.489
I thought, given time,
you'd get past the sex thing,

14:20.673 --> 14:22.257
but you obviously can't.

14:22.980 --> 14:26.752
I'm going back to IT,
where my skills are appreciated.

14:27.303 --> 14:30.933
I'm not interested in you
sexually and I never will be.

14:33.070 --> 14:35.578
I didn't want it
to come to this, Jen.

14:35.798 --> 14:37.910
But would you like a cup of tea?

14:41.902 --> 14:44.146
<i>Very busy. Leave a message.</i>

14:52.955 --> 14:54.932
Before you do this, you're sure

14:54.972 --> 14:58.765
you can hit it so that it won't
damage my teeth as it goes in?

14:58.805 --> 15:00.719
It's a very simple chip shot.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.199
You totalled that cup, dude!

15:13.321 --> 15:14.893
OK, one more try.

15:15.171 --> 15:17.044
Jen would never let us do this!

15:17.084 --> 15:21.968
No, she'd be like, “This is dangerous,
you're gonna hit Moss in the face.”

15:22.393 --> 15:25.122
How many more things have
we got left on the list?

15:25.162 --> 15:27.670
I think we've done
nearly all of them.

15:30.716 --> 15:33.524
Yeah. OK, we've had a little sleep,

15:33.761 --> 15:35.939
we've walked around in our pants…

15:36.364 --> 15:39.054
The only thing left to do
is a prank phone-call.

15:39.094 --> 15:42.196
All right, but let's
concentrate on this first.

15:46.421 --> 15:47.873
WINDOW SMASHES
Whoops!

15:51.035 --> 15:52.564
OK, do it again.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.238
Two lovely cups of tea.

15:58.659 --> 16:01.462
I'm like your P. A, cos I made the tea!

16:05.250 --> 16:06.351
Hang on.

16:11.825 --> 16:14.399
We both take it
the same way, don't we?

16:18.930 --> 16:20.646
Aren't you gonna drink it?

16:20.797 --> 16:21.950
I will in a bit.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.748
So, well done
on passing the test, Jen.

16:25.246 --> 16:26.530
–The test?
–Yes!

16:26.753 --> 16:30.636
The clumsy seduction.
Don't say you couldn't see through it.

16:30.676 --> 16:34.225
They were a test to find out whether
you really wanted to work for me

16:34.265 --> 16:37.895
or whether you just wanted
to come up here for my body.

16:38.211 --> 16:40.360
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

16:40.788 --> 16:42.108
–All right.
–No, no.

16:42.177 --> 16:44.468
Physically, you're just
not the sort of man I go for.

16:44.508 --> 16:45.530
Yeah, thanks.

16:45.714 --> 16:47.830
I go for classically good-looking men.
Blond,

16:47.870 --> 16:49.625
broad, clean-shaven.

16:49.821 --> 16:52.395
All right!
Enough of the jibber jabber!

16:53.310 --> 16:57.072
I want you to watch this DVD
presentation I've just made.

16:57.109 --> 16:58.183
Any thoughts?

17:00.067 --> 17:01.519
I haven't seen it yet.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.133
Then see it now!

17:10.483 --> 17:13.758
Hello, I'd like to
order a pizza, please.

17:14.911 --> 17:18.127
Can I have it with extra grapes?

17:19.829 --> 17:21.546
Grapes⁈ What are you like?

17:23.759 --> 17:25.936
Yes, a pizza with grapes, please.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.263
What?

17:30.102 --> 17:32.016
You have a pizza with grapes?

17:33.167 --> 17:35.081
Do grapes even go with pizza?

17:35.907 --> 17:38.920
Oh, I see. Oh, you got me.

17:39.234 --> 17:42.130
Oh, very funny. Very mature.

17:43.074 --> 17:45.318
You're only wasting your own time.

17:49.220 --> 17:52.124
I wish I could've seen
the look on his face!

17:58.781 --> 18:01.553
I can't believe we've
done the whole list.

18:03.261 --> 18:05.505
We've really done all eight items?

18:11.617 --> 18:14.211
Do you want to play Guitar Hero?
I hate those kind of games.

18:14.251 --> 18:15.482
Right

18:17.147 --> 18:19.366
–Oh, I've got one!
–What⁈

18:20.729 --> 18:22.877
Why don't we ring them up again

18:23.244 --> 18:26.412
and ask if they do a pizza
with pineapple on it⁈

18:39.034 --> 18:41.476
Maybe somebody's
computer will break.

18:42.839 --> 18:46.403
I think you'd enjoy this more
while drinking your tea.

18:47.582 --> 18:48.928
<i>Reynholm Industries.</i>

18:48.968 --> 18:52.400
<i>A big, hard business
in a big, hard building.</i>

18:52.619 --> 18:56.680
<i>Busting into the future
strongly, again and again.</i>

18:57.047 --> 18:58.829
<i>Pounding the future.</i>

18:58.881 --> 19:01.140
<i>Making the future beg for it.</i>

19:01.180 --> 19:02.633
<i>The future wants it</i>

19:02.673 --> 19:05.961
<i>and Reynholm Industries wants to
give it to the future.</i>

19:06.001 --> 19:08.024
<i>That's what it's all about.</i>

19:08.064 --> 19:10.382
<i>We don't want to be like a dead fly,</i>

19:10.422 --> 19:14.117
<i>regretting what we didn't do
in our short time on this earth.</i>

19:14.157 --> 19:17.127
<i>So maybe it's time
to make a decision.</i>

19:18.729 --> 19:21.171
–What was that⁈
–What? What happened?

19:21.392 --> 19:22.964
Something just flashed up there.

19:23.004 --> 19:25.512
–Really? Are you sure?
–Let me rewind.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.383
There it is again!

19:29.248 --> 19:31.500
Something's wrong with your laptop.

19:31.540 --> 19:32.794
I'll call the boys.

19:35.671 --> 19:37.858
Roy, hello. I didn't even
hear the phone ring.

19:37.898 --> 19:40.884
Oh, Jen! Jen! Hello!
It's Jen!

19:42.638 --> 19:44.734
Hi.
How are you, Jen?

19:44.970 --> 19:47.590
Good, yeah.
Listen, Douglas's computer…

19:47.781 --> 19:49.602
–What's been happening?
–What?

19:49.642 --> 19:51.806
–How's everything upstairs?
–Tell her I'm here!

19:51.846 --> 19:52.973
Moss is with me.

19:53.848 --> 19:56.620
You do know I spoke to you
four hours ago?

19:57.857 --> 20:00.497
Jen, Jen, when are you
coming back down?

20:00.805 --> 20:02.986
–Let me speak to her!
–No! I'm talking to her!

20:03.026 --> 20:07.448
I don't know. Listen, Douglas's
laptop is having some difficulties.

20:07.614 --> 20:10.452
<i>So, can you come up
and have a look?</i>

20:11.979 --> 20:13.865
Oh, no, not these idiots.

20:14.599 --> 20:18.361
Mr Reynholm, the men in
the IT department are my friends.

20:18.642 --> 20:20.031
They're not idiots.

20:25.578 --> 20:27.030
What the hell is this?

20:27.185 --> 20:29.363
Where the hell are your trousers?

20:30.460 --> 20:33.503
I get it.
When the cat's away. Yeah.

20:34.027 --> 20:37.459
It's like all the fun
I had just after my wife died.

20:38.020 --> 20:40.330
Listen, don't sit on anything.
And…

20:41.609 --> 20:44.730
Mr Reynholm's laptop is broken.
Something flashed up a second ago.

20:44.770 --> 20:45.883
I'll help! No!

20:46.066 --> 20:48.692
Have you tried turning it
off and on again?

20:48.732 --> 20:50.198
No, we haven't tried that.

20:50.238 --> 20:52.490
–Well, let's have a little look see.
–I want a go!

20:52.530 --> 20:55.252
–I want to do a job!
–You can do the next one!

20:55.292 --> 20:56.414
Don't touch that.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.934
Why are you drinking Rohypnol, Jen?

21:03.308 --> 21:06.688
Flunitrazepam… Yep,
that's definitely Rohypnol.

21:07.650 --> 21:09.569
Are you having problems
with insomnia?

21:09.609 --> 21:10.710
That's nonsense.

21:10.893 --> 21:11.941
Drink it, then.

21:12.387 --> 21:13.575
All right, I will.

21:18.603 --> 21:21.309
There we go.
Perfectly normal cup of tea.

21:21.407 --> 21:24.279
Now if you don't mind,
I have some filoffing to do.

21:24.319 --> 21:26.075
Filoffing?
Yes,

21:26.442 --> 21:30.378
I have some filoffels that need
pipping and I'm the mulder.

21:31.010 --> 21:33.337
You did put something in that tea!

21:33.756 --> 21:35.328
Damn that sorcerer!

21:35.564 --> 21:38.468
20 gold pieces
and I'm wankered on Rohypnol!

21:39.914 --> 21:41.827
Oh, God, Rohypnol!

21:42.613 --> 21:44.404
And what's the matter with you?

21:44.444 --> 21:45.963
I just saw his film.

21:47.352 --> 21:48.738
I didn't care for it.

21:49.678 --> 21:52.770
I am very aroused.

21:53.142 --> 21:55.539
I want to come back downstairs
with you guys.

21:55.579 --> 21:58.054
No, it's all right,
we've got a replacement.

21:58.094 --> 22:00.536
–Shut up!
–Oh, right, OK. Who's that?

22:00.556 --> 22:02.010
It's an answering machine.

22:02.050 --> 22:03.543
An answering machine?

22:03.884 --> 22:06.186
It's called Jen 2.
It does everything you do

22:06.226 --> 22:07.837
and it doesn't boss us about.

22:07.877 --> 22:09.004
It is brilliant.

22:09.187 --> 22:10.824
Oh, shut up, for God's sake!

22:10.864 --> 22:13.318
You replaced me
with an answering machine?

22:13.358 --> 22:15.967
OK, I think we should
probably leave now.

22:16.007 --> 22:18.713
I don't really like
the look in his eyes.

22:20.232 --> 22:22.740
Yeah, let's go, let's go.
Where's Jen?

22:25.937 --> 22:29.029
Pucker up, boys. It's hammer time!

22:33.064 --> 22:35.186
You lot deserve each other!

22:37.991 --> 22:41.621
I think you've accidentally
locked the door there, Jen!
