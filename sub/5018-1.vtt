02:34.640 --> 02:38.850
And tonight we embark
on the last and most ambitious...

02:39.040 --> 02:42.931
phase of our campaign
to end tyranny across the globe.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.805
Mr. President, given the severity
of the current crisis...

02:46.000 --> 02:48.162
what is the risk
to the American population?

02:48.360 --> 02:50.522
Our level of preparedness
couldn't be higher.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.610
I am confident that we will prevail,
whatever may come.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.529
But, Mr. President...

02:55.720 --> 02:59.008
Rest assured, my administration
is taking steps...

02:59.240 --> 03:02.767
to ensure our way of life will continue.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.010
Mr. President, is that last statement
connected to the rumours...

03:10.200 --> 03:12.441
of these so-called
"Noah's Ark" facilities?

03:12.640 --> 03:16.122
We're hearing reports of scientists,
engineers, doctors...

03:16.320 --> 03:18.004
being whisked away in the night.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.727
Is the government hiding these people
in underground shelters?

03:21.920 --> 03:24.241
We have a number of contingency plans...

03:24.440 --> 03:26.761
in place, mainly to provide
peace of mind.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.167
But let me be very clear.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.809
Our priority is the safety
of all the American people.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.048
Sir, are we facing
an impending catastrophe?

03:36.240 --> 03:39.084
Is the government deciding
who lives and who dies?

03:40.040 --> 03:43.442
Plenty of words from this president
but very few details.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.211
And as more time passes
with no clear answers...

03:46.400 --> 03:48.721
the situation becomes more dire.

03:48.920 --> 03:52.129
This is Natalie reporting,
Channel Nine News.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.366
You having a nightmare, buddy?

06:36.600 --> 06:39.285
Just let me out. Let me out.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.884
Please.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.767
Goddamn it, Bauer!

06:47.520 --> 06:49.363
Gotta loosen the arm.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.963
- Please quit playing around. Let me up.
- Can't do that.

06:55.560 --> 07:00.566
Gradual transition to a normal
air mixture prevents what?

07:01.520 --> 07:03.045
Oxygen toxicity.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.842
Which can harm which organs?

07:07.320 --> 07:09.800
Eyes, brain and...

07:11.640 --> 07:13.722
and lungs!

07:28.480 --> 07:31.051
You'd think that somebody
that just slept six months...

07:31.240 --> 07:32.605
would be in a better mood.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.443
Why does my tank's cycle
take twice as long as yours?

07:37.800 --> 07:41.771
Well, give it enough time,
everything in this dump's gonna break.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.129
- Did you clock in?
- No.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.089
Oh, come on.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.284
I just don't want the other facilities
to think that we're....

07:58.480 --> 08:02.326
What, dead? Come on. You can say it.
It's not gonna kill you.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.609
How's the weather up there?

08:09.680 --> 08:14.208
- Nice day for a picnic?
- Outside air toxicity's still in the red.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.165
Just like last cycle
and the cycle before that.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.330
I don't know why you check anymore.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.803
All the other facilities
have checked in.

08:25.080 --> 08:29.085
- Everyone's okay.
- Thank my lucky stars.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.889
- Oh, not this again, buddy.
- No, just a minute. I have an idea.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.962
How many times are you gonna do this?

08:44.159 --> 08:46.766
This piece of crap network
wasn't set up...

08:47.000 --> 08:50.561
For direct communication.
Yeah, I get it.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.485
Yeah, I wish I had the Internet.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.883
Maybe they'll be better prepared
for the next Apocalypse.

09:01.480 --> 09:05.246
Better use the bathroom first, buddy,
if you know what I mean.

09:21.640 --> 09:25.087
Hey, this is not funny.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.850
You don't think it's true?

09:27.240 --> 09:29.925
- What isn't true?
- They're all dead.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.002
You don't need to remind me.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.043
Today's shopping list.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.571
Look at this.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.969
Man, I've seen that a million times.
I got it memorised.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.727
No, no, no, it says there was
some kind of seismic activity.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.287
- What?
- Yeah, an earthquake.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.245
I know what seismic means.
What does it say?

10:11.520 --> 10:13.921
Oh, this is not good.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.169
Look, if there's any sort of leak down
here at all, this place...

10:17.360 --> 10:21.968
would be full of poison air from outside.
We'd be dead. What else?

10:23.560 --> 10:26.643
Electrical systems,
core structural inspection.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.808
Core structural inspection?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.527
That's a joke.
This is an abandoned missile silo.

10:33.960 --> 10:38.045
- What about the tanks?
- Individual unit diagnostics.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.487
- No way.
- Unbelievable.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.411
You know what?
I'll do everything else if you do that.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.602
Those sleepers, yuck,
you know they creep me out.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.882
- No.
- Come on.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.485
It's your turn this time.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.730
On three?

10:54.400 --> 10:57.165
One, two, three.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.009
Clock's ticking. Chop, chop.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.322
Doesn't he drive you nuts?

13:12.320 --> 13:14.288
I've gotten used to him.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.488
I've been dreaming of you.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.681
How's the diagnostics, buddy?

13:59.240 --> 14:01.925
Filter checks are good
on all nine levels.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.964
No damage at all
from that seismic activity.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.643
- What about the tanks?
- Still working on them.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.408
Did you tell him about us?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.521
I'm waiting for the right time.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.885
You made a promise.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.844
I'll tell him.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.804
Tell me what?

14:42.160 --> 14:46.051
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.484
- I hate when you do that.
- Yeah.

14:54.680 --> 14:58.287
I hate when you talk to the sleepers.
I find it creepy.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.005
They're just people.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.488
Yeah, you standing over them,
staring at them.

15:03.680 --> 15:07.207
What does that make you?
Sort of a weird pervert?

15:07.400 --> 15:10.882
Look who's talking.
The chronic masturbator.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.323
Well, at least I ain't diddling
some dead girl.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.524
She's not dead.
She's waiting, like we are.

15:17.720 --> 15:22.328
Hey, don't you compare her to me.
I work for a living.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.767
What do they do?

15:25.120 --> 15:27.771
Come on, you know they're important.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.050
Important, huh?

15:31.320 --> 15:35.006
What, this guy right here?
"Herpetology."

15:35.240 --> 15:40.246
- What's that? Some herpes specialist?
- Reptiles and amphibians.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.808
- You're a genius.
- These people are seeds, Bauer.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.451
The last in the world.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.324
Knowledge and experience
that's unique...

15:48.520 --> 15:51.569
Unique and irreplaceable.
Blah, blah, blah....

15:51.800 --> 15:53.802
You sound like a broken record, man.

15:55.360 --> 15:59.126
- They're the future. Have some respect.
- Come on, buddy.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.049
Don't give me that crap.

16:01.240 --> 16:06.371
We waste our whole lives
down here, in this hole...

16:07.680 --> 16:09.921
so they can survive?

16:40.240 --> 16:43.244
I understand how you feel.
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

16:43.480 --> 16:46.484
- Working down here? Saving...
- Saving the future of humanity?

16:46.680 --> 16:51.288
Come on. Wake up, push a button,
change a light bulb, go back to sleep.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.608
Rinse and repeat, buddy.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.163
- Doesn't it bug you just a little bit?
- No.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.369
You know we got the short end
of the stick down here, right?

17:03.560 --> 17:07.531
What are you going to do about it?
Complain to management?

17:07.720 --> 17:10.451
Yeah, I might.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.643
I think I'll write a letter.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.844
You do that.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.086
A gorgeous afternoon for baseball.
The sun is shining.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.682
And we do wanna remind everybody
who's out here enjoying the game...

17:24.880 --> 17:28.521
that these teams are donating all
the proceeds of tonight's ticket sales...

17:28.720 --> 17:32.327
to the relief effort after
last week's bombing in Europe.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.525
So we thank everybody for their support
at this terrible time.

17:36.720 --> 17:41.521
"Probabilistic calculation
of Air Pollutant Dispersion." Bingo.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.724
What's that?
Little light reading for the crapper?

17:45.240 --> 17:48.050
"This equation can be used
to calculate time remaining...

17:48.240 --> 17:50.083
until viable surface re-habitation."

17:50.280 --> 17:51.611
- Ball two.
- Listen to this.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.047
- Pitcher's a little bit shaky.
- Listen, listen.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.767
"Parameters are,
cross wind dispersion...

17:57.960 --> 18:01.521
concentration of pollutant,
horizontal deviation," right?

18:01.760 --> 18:03.489
- Right? Listen to this.
- You can almost see the homerun...

18:03.720 --> 18:05.051
in this guy's eyes right here.

18:05.240 --> 18:08.528
"Optimal scenario
for re-habitation is 30 years.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.361
But this figure may deviate
upwards of 150 years."

18:12.560 --> 18:14.210
Did you hear that?

18:15.840 --> 18:17.569
You've watched the game 100 times.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.728
Here it comes, here it comes.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.763
And there it goes!

18:24.200 --> 18:27.841
I'm saying we might not be stuck
down here for much longer.

18:29.080 --> 18:35.042
Yeah, just another hundred years, right?
Blink of an eye.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.403
Says here it could be as little
as 20 more shifts.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.001
Buddy, that's for a weather forecast...

18:41.200 --> 18:44.363
which is 50 percent right
10 percent of the time.

18:44.600 --> 18:48.082
But you just keep on reading, all right?

18:48.280 --> 18:52.001
We interrupt your regularly scheduled
programming to bring you this....

18:52.200 --> 18:55.409
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it all before.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.444
We've just received confirmation of
a series of explosions around the world.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.687
Buddy, it's your move.

18:59.880 --> 19:04.442
Major cities such as Munich, Tokyo,
London and Brisbane were targeted.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.642
What's it gonna be, Mr. Kasparov?

19:06.840 --> 19:10.561
Reports are coming from reliable
sources from inside the government.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.762
May not be official, but....

19:13.000 --> 19:16.447
Now this isn't official, but we're hearing
that these attacks could be...

19:16.640 --> 19:19.644
similar to the hybrid nuclear and
chemical weapon that devastated...

19:19.880 --> 19:22.042
Tel Aviv earlier this year.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.885
The president has now raised military
readiness to DEFCON One...

19:27.080 --> 19:30.971
which is the highest threat level
this country has ever been in.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.526
There you go.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.724
You got six more months
to regret that move.

19:42.680 --> 19:48.130
- Wait. I thought we had more time.
- Nope. Like sand through the hourglass.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.004
- You check these diagnostics?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.363
Just about to make our sleep cocktails.

19:56.160 --> 20:00.609
Good. I got a date with Miss 1979.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.123
Back to sleep?

20:54.160 --> 20:56.447
That's the routine.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.961
We'll be together soon.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.800
There's nothing to be afraid of.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.966
I tell myself that every time.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.603
My brain knows it.

22:13.800 --> 22:18.567
But my body tells me that I'm about
to climb into a high-tech coffin.

22:20.320 --> 22:25.611
- Have you forgotten already?
- Please, Abby, I've got work to do.

22:28.320 --> 22:32.450
Think of how good
it would feel to touch me.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.444
Oh, no, no, no...!

22:52.640 --> 22:56.531
- Bauer! Bauer! Open the door!
- What the fuck?

22:56.720 --> 22:58.529
I need the fire extinguisher, please!

22:58.720 --> 23:01.451
- Not a good time, buddy!
- Open the door! Come on!

23:01.640 --> 23:04.803
I need the fire extinguisher!
There's a fire!

23:16.680 --> 23:19.047
You didn't have to rip it apart.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.726
- Yeah, well, I thought it would help.
- That's not right.

23:23.960 --> 23:27.009
Hey, you were responsible
for checking the diagnostics!

23:28.440 --> 23:30.169
Hey, you hurt?

23:33.880 --> 23:35.325
- Let me see it.
- No.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.841
Oh, come on. Stop being a baby.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.443
- How'd you get that?
- From your stupid tank.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.051
How am I supposed
to take care of myself now?

23:48.040 --> 23:51.840
- Use the other hand.
- What if I need two hands?

23:55.720 --> 23:59.088
Shit, we're out of air.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.801
I don't know what we're breathing.
There's not much left of it.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.244
- Come on, what does that thing say?
- One second, one second.

24:17.240 --> 24:20.289
Bingo. "Emergency release
via Safety Reserve Cylinders."

24:20.520 --> 24:22.488
Here, let me see.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.043
You're gonna love this.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.364
Looks like we gotta go up
the Airway Routing Chamber.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.531
Come on, it's not any harder
than getting in your tank.

24:39.720 --> 24:41.370
Exactly.

25:01.880 --> 25:05.885
- Did the book say where it is?
- Somewhere in this jury-rigged operation.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.082
Why don't you check over there?

25:28.920 --> 25:33.209
- Wait, did you say red valve?
- No, don't touch that one.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.368
Red's the air outside.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.325
Hey.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.086
Found it, over here.

25:43.880 --> 25:46.360
Emergency air and power supply.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.041
Yeah, here.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.364
Is it working?

26:08.960 --> 26:10.564
Shut up, man.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.404
Save your air.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.482
It's not working.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.968
Still nothing.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.766
- I had a wife.
- What?

26:56.760 --> 26:58.603
Three little girls.

26:59.920 --> 27:03.641
I thought "unmarried"
was one of the job requirements.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.124
I lied...

27:07.920 --> 27:10.366
to get the job, you know.

27:13.680 --> 27:16.809
Who knew all this
end-of-the world shit was real?

27:19.920 --> 27:22.048
Before they locked the doors.

27:28.640 --> 27:33.282
Can you imagine what it was like
for them up there?

27:35.720 --> 27:37.484
I'm sorry.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.882
I had about a minute.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.205
I could've gone up, been with them.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.843
And they sealed us in.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.041
There's nothing you could have done.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.690
You don't understand.
You don't have a family.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.647
I can imagine.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.411
No, you can't.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.648
It's just you and me now.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.521
We're a family.

28:38.920 --> 28:42.049
Reserved air just kicked in.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.965
Time to make our next move.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.282
Let's go, clock's ticking.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.528
Where the hell are they?

29:04.240 --> 29:06.208
It doesn't say.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.490
Maybe you're looking
in the wrong section or something.

29:10.600 --> 29:14.161
"Deep Sleep Vessel, Service and
Replacement Instruction," right here.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.966
Man, I told you this
is a half-ass operation.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.561
They don't even have spare parts for us.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.326
No, the parts are down here somewhere.
They have to be.

29:23.520 --> 29:27.320
You see, this is what happens when you
slap things together at the last minute!

29:33.240 --> 29:35.607
This is not the only storage room.

29:44.480 --> 29:48.451
Man, I know every inch of this place.
This blueprint isn't gonna help you.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.924
Long-term storage.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.280
It's just a load of crap
for when the sleepers wake up.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.046
We're not maintaining that area.

30:00.240 --> 30:04.040
- What are those numbers for?
- I don't know.

30:06.680 --> 30:11.049
- It should be safe, right?
- It should be, it's within the main seal.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.204
The only reason it's blocked off
is to save oxygen.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.846
I bet the spare parts are in there.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.971
All right.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.288
No second chances.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.445
All right.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.608
This place is creepy.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.369
- It's like a cave or something.
- Stop.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.129
Scared, buddy?

31:29.720 --> 31:32.803
Just feeling a little claustrophobic,
that's all.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.726
Cut it out. Cut it out!

31:46.960 --> 31:48.450
What was that?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.402
- Maybe it's an animal or something.
- How?

31:51.600 --> 31:56.049
- There hasn't been any oxygen in here.
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.327
Come on, let's try this door right here.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.804
Come on.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.761
Hey, Bauer, what's this?

32:45.080 --> 32:47.765
That's a Jacuzzi. What's it look like?

32:47.960 --> 32:52.602
What are these cameras for?
They don't show up on our monitors.

32:54.400 --> 32:58.610
That's the old security system.
Watch out for Commies.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.531
Do you think any of these still work?

33:04.200 --> 33:08.364
No. There's nothing here. Let's motor.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.649
- I'll start over here.
- All right.

33:46.240 --> 33:50.086
All right, bingo.
Someone's record collection.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.170
Abby, Abby, Abby.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.129
Bauer! I found it!

34:28.000 --> 34:29.206
I found it.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.849
Oh, yeah.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.889
All right, I think it's ready.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.969
What do you mean, think?
I'm ready for bed.

34:53.159 --> 34:56.004
I should go in first,
just in case something happens.

34:57.680 --> 35:01.321
Nothing's gonna happen. We did it.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.807
- Did we?
- Yeah.

35:04.920 --> 35:08.049
Jump in. Gotta get back on the horse.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.603
Let me just check something.
Just a minute.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.285
Fine.

35:18.040 --> 35:21.328
I'll pinch hit. You run the diagnostics.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.046
No, I should do it. It's my tank.
I should go in first.

35:24.640 --> 35:27.007
The sooner we do this,
the sooner we get some sleep.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.089
- Sure about this?
- Yep.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.280
If anything seems off, just give a sign.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.847
- Zip me up.
- Okay.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.641
- Ready?
- Yeah.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.090
Hey!

36:15.160 --> 36:18.767
- Yeah, what?
- You hear that?

36:20.480 --> 36:24.610
- I don't hear anything.
- Sounds like a leak.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.210
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.891
And the air is definitely
getting thinner in here.

36:42.320 --> 36:45.244
- You sure?
- Yeah.

36:45.440 --> 36:49.331
- Check the air pump.
- Okay, let me check.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.484
Cartwright?

37:04.040 --> 37:07.362
Hey, let me out of here.
I'll check it. I'll check it myself.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.044
Cartwright!

37:17.800 --> 37:19.450
Cartwright!

37:22.840 --> 37:24.569
Cartwright!

38:18.920 --> 38:20.649
Bauer!

38:31.520 --> 38:33.443
I'm so sorry.

38:38.440 --> 38:43.924
My God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? You okay?

38:58.520 --> 39:01.091
Where were you? I was calling your name!

39:01.280 --> 39:03.282
I was right here!

39:04.040 --> 39:06.441
- What happened?
- I couldn't get the tank open!

39:06.640 --> 39:09.689
- So I was looking for something to cut it.
- What took you so long?

39:09.880 --> 39:13.168
I just told you.
The box cutter, I couldn't find it!

39:17.800 --> 39:21.361
- What happened to the tank?
- I don't know.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.528
Maybe I missed something.

39:24.960 --> 39:29.443
- You missed something.
- It was an accident.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.849
It would've been so convenient
for you, huh?

39:33.760 --> 39:36.240
One tank between the two of us.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.809
- All your problems solved.
- That's crazy! It's my tank!

39:40.000 --> 39:43.846
I was supposed to be in there!
But you insisted.

39:44.040 --> 39:47.487
- Did I?
- Yes, you did, remember?

39:49.640 --> 39:51.324
Remember?

39:55.880 --> 39:58.611
I did. You're right.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.164
- I'm sorry.
- I'm fine.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.966
This might be a stupid question,
do we have parts for that?

40:22.160 --> 40:23.889
I don't know.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.127
And that's all the reserve air we got.

40:31.440 --> 40:34.922
All right, change of plans.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.370
All right.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.082
Which one looks good?

40:46.480 --> 40:48.164
Good for what?

40:50.360 --> 40:52.362
All right, maybe not that one.

40:52.560 --> 40:56.531
What about this guy right here?
"Ichthyology."

40:56.760 --> 40:58.922
I don't even know what that means.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.804
We can't just open one
of the tanks and put me inside.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.809
Yeah, why not?

41:05.400 --> 41:07.607
What about the person
who's already in the tank?

41:07.800 --> 41:10.280
What happens to him
when we pull him out?

41:10.480 --> 41:13.006
- Well, I guess we kill him.
- What?

41:13.960 --> 41:17.442
The only reason why we're here
is to keep these people alive.

41:17.640 --> 41:20.723
They're the last remnants
of human civilisation.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.445
Fuck them.

41:24.280 --> 41:27.329
We can't just decide
who lives and who dies!

41:28.240 --> 41:31.528
You know what we can do?
Take care of ourselves.

41:31.720 --> 41:34.883
No, you know what?
Take care of each other.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.605
That's what families do.

41:38.320 --> 41:41.688
Now, you need to pick one right now.

41:51.920 --> 41:53.445
All right.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.449
All right.

42:04.800 --> 42:08.964
Morphine, good idea. Ticket to paradise.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.731
Give him a heavy dose
while he's still inside.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.929
Don't do this.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.248
What choice do I have?

42:24.360 --> 42:27.887
- There's another way.
- We don't have time.

42:28.640 --> 42:32.850
It's as simple as ABC.

42:37.840 --> 42:41.811
Hey, what's the matter with you?

42:48.680 --> 42:51.411
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.841
No, I'm not doing this.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.042
Fine. Give me the needle,
I'll do it myself.

42:57.240 --> 43:00.528
Listen, listen, listen,
there's another way.

43:00.760 --> 43:04.287
Look, I know this breaks
your soft little heart...

43:04.480 --> 43:07.609
but sometimes you've gotta sacrifice
a pawn to stay in the game.

43:07.800 --> 43:10.883
- Don't let him.
- I said, I'm not doing this.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.651
- Don't you wanna live?
- It's murder.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.764
- We're techs, Bauer, not murderers!
- Come on.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.884
What happens if they find out
through the next facilities?

43:20.080 --> 43:23.323
Take a look around, man.
We're the only ones here!

43:25.840 --> 43:29.447
It's not murder, it's survival.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.130
Listen, we have an obligation
to keep these people alive.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.086
You're a piece of work, man,
you know that?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.445
Did you feel that?

43:46.680 --> 43:49.206
That's what it's going to feel like
when the air runs out down here.

43:49.400 --> 43:52.290
Your lungs starving for oxygen
and there isn't any.

43:54.880 --> 43:59.044
Look, someone's gonna die, I'm sorry.
But you are not leaving me here alone.

43:59.280 --> 44:02.489
Please, don't do it.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.001
You'll thank me later.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.849
- That's enough.
- What are you gonna do with that?

44:31.520 --> 44:36.082
You gonna stab me with it?
Go ahead, cut my throat.

44:36.280 --> 44:37.884
- Solve all your problems.
- Listen.

44:38.240 --> 44:41.005
Try to save a guy's life
and he kicks you right in the nuts.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.481
- You don't understand. Listen.
- No, you don't understand.

44:43.680 --> 44:46.047
These people,
they got their ticket to the future...

44:46.280 --> 44:48.169
by stepping on people like you and me!

44:49.080 --> 44:51.606
You wanna trade your life
for one of theirs?

44:52.640 --> 44:54.483
I told you, I have an idea.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.841
Now are you with me or what?

44:59.520 --> 45:03.002
Yeah. Yeah, I'm with you.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.607
What are friends for, right?

45:15.320 --> 45:17.448
Man, I don't know.

45:18.360 --> 45:19.805
But the codes match.

45:20.720 --> 45:23.121
ABC 108 here.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.368
And ABC 108.

45:26.920 --> 45:31.369
I'm telling you, there's another facility,
right here, next to us.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.888
- Maybe.
- Come on.

45:34.120 --> 45:37.522
It's too dangerous, man.
We don't even know what's out there.

45:37.720 --> 45:40.371
They checked in. Look at the monitor.

45:40.960 --> 45:44.328
There are people in that facility
with spare parts.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.002
You're gonna have to break the red seal.

45:48.200 --> 45:51.170
- Okay. It's a risk.
- It's a huge risk.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.567
This facility's a fragile bubble.

45:53.760 --> 45:57.128
One wrong thing and this whole place
fills up full of contaminated air.

45:57.720 --> 46:01.725
Then instead of just killing
one of them, we all die.

46:01.920 --> 46:04.446
We'll just have to make sure
nothing happens.

46:34.920 --> 46:36.729
Can you hear me?

46:42.560 --> 46:43.925
All right.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.522
- Bauer...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, hugs and kisses.

46:56.720 --> 46:59.610
Good luck, all that.

47:18.720 --> 47:22.361
- Oh, shit!
- What? What is it?

47:22.920 --> 47:28.450
- A dead body. A soldier.
- Ours or theirs?

47:30.200 --> 47:31.565
I can't tell.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.240
Lucky he didn't shoot out
the airlock door.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.321
Better luck in the next life.

47:39.520 --> 47:42.000
Come on, buddy, you're wasting air.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.967
I'm waiting on the air filters.

47:46.840 --> 47:47.887
Okay.

47:53.040 --> 47:57.250
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

47:57.440 --> 47:59.124
Okay.

48:45.560 --> 48:47.642
Find anything good out there?

48:48.320 --> 48:52.689
Just dust. Blue dust. It's everywhere.

48:53.280 --> 48:55.760
Yeah, that's the airborne contaminant.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.446
You got 31 minutes left, buddy.

49:03.640 --> 49:06.564
If you're not back soon,
I'll see you in six months.

49:14.280 --> 49:16.726
Trying to move people
as quickly as possible...

49:16.920 --> 49:20.163
but there are rumours that
these public shelters are not safe...

49:20.360 --> 49:21.964
against these chemical weapons.

49:51.600 --> 49:55.207
Oh, hey. I got you.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.048
Yeah, I see you on one of the monitors.

49:59.240 --> 50:02.403
You're right, those old cameras
still work. Give me a thumbs-up.

50:05.560 --> 50:08.166
All right, cool, keep moving.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.005
All right, I'm just trying to figure out
where the hell you're going.

51:26.600 --> 51:28.523
I think I've found it.

51:31.520 --> 51:33.648
Oh, you were right.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.448
It's stuck.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.406
Come on, you big sissy. Give it a push.

52:05.440 --> 52:06.805
I'm in.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.607
All right, say hi
to the ABC people for me.

52:15.240 --> 52:17.686
- Bauer?
- Yeah.

52:17.880 --> 52:20.486
I think we got a problem.

52:22.080 --> 52:23.923
It's not working.

52:24.160 --> 52:29.803
- Did the green light come on?
- No, nothing's working.

52:31.120 --> 52:33.646
Looks like you're locked out, buddy.

52:33.840 --> 52:37.481
Hello! Hey!

52:38.360 --> 52:40.647
Hey, stop, stop, you're wasting air.

52:40.880 --> 52:43.451
Well, I was hoping somebody
could hear me.

52:44.800 --> 52:48.566
Oh, shit, what do we do now?

52:48.760 --> 52:51.525
Sit tight, buddy, I'm working on it.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.483
Don't give up.

53:10.840 --> 53:14.083
What if he's right?
What if there's no future?

53:15.000 --> 53:17.287
You've always found a way for us.

53:19.720 --> 53:22.405
I'd lose my mind without you.

53:24.680 --> 53:26.648
Hey, buddy.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.890
I think I found a way around it
but you're not gonna like it.

53:31.080 --> 53:32.650
Just tell me.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.650
Back the way you came, about ten yards.

53:35.840 --> 53:39.970
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know it when you see it.

54:12.040 --> 54:15.044
- You're joking.
- Nope.

54:15.240 --> 54:16.730
There's no room up there.

54:16.920 --> 54:20.447
Come on, buddy, I've crawled through
the exact same air ducts in our place.

54:20.640 --> 54:23.405
If I can do it, you can do it.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.203
Is there any other way?

54:30.400 --> 54:34.325
Well, if you want those guys
to help you, that's your way in.

54:39.160 --> 54:42.482
Come on, it's a good way
to cure your claustrophobia.

54:44.280 --> 54:47.204
All right. I'm going in.

55:31.560 --> 55:35.963
I'm coming to an intersection.
Which way?

55:36.440 --> 55:41.321
Left takes you back here, so go right,
right into their main ventilation system.

56:07.200 --> 56:10.727
- You okay, buddy?
- Yeah.

56:14.320 --> 56:18.609
- This place is full of dead people.
- Which way are they headed?

56:18.800 --> 56:21.007
Are they facing the same direction
you're going?

56:21.200 --> 56:22.770
I can't tell.

56:24.240 --> 56:27.961
- The good news is, they didn't break in.
- What?

56:28.160 --> 56:31.881
If they died out there, then the main
ventilation system is still sealed.

56:41.720 --> 56:45.281
Hey, you do not want
to throw up in your mask.

56:50.680 --> 56:52.409
Thanks for the advice.

56:52.600 --> 56:56.400
I got another idea.
You can take your helmet off...

56:56.640 --> 56:59.564
join that little yard sale
they got going on down there.

56:59.760 --> 57:01.922
Go to hell, Bauer.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.166
Bauer...

57:06.680 --> 57:08.808
the main filter?

57:09.400 --> 57:12.324
What? You're breaking up.

57:12.640 --> 57:17.646
- I said, can I bypass the main filter unit?
- Yes.

57:17.840 --> 57:21.162
- Answer me.
- Yes!

57:22.200 --> 57:25.170
Look, I'm gonna try to boost
our radio signal.

57:28.280 --> 57:30.851
Don't worry about it.
I'll be right here.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.087
Bauer.

57:40.600 --> 57:42.409
Answer me.

58:47.440 --> 58:50.887
Hey, Bauer, are you there?

58:56.600 --> 58:59.046
Bauer, are you there?

59:01.120 --> 59:02.963
Yeah, I'm here.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.571
I'm at the filter bypass.

59:11.400 --> 59:14.927
Hey, Bauer....

59:15.960 --> 59:19.407
Do you hear me? I'm almost through.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.762
Good for you, buddy.

59:29.800 --> 59:35.921
- Wait, something's not right.
- You're telling me.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.764
This must have happened a long time ago.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.088
You're breaking up.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.888
They're all....

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.731
They're all...

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.763
dead.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.363
Unique and irreplaceable.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.164
They were checked in today, ABC 108.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.450
They checked in today
and every other time.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.927
We saw it on the system.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.529
Do you hear me, Bauer?
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.209
It's a lie.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.042
The whole system?

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.888
All of it.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.489
It's a lie.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.007
Can't trust anyone anymore.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.766
My God, Bauer.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.811
There's no network.
No connection to other facilities.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:47.727
Just us and some computer
telling us that we're not alone.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.602
You're not alone, my love.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.922
It's designed to keep us
from losing our minds.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.165
Bauer, are you there?

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.125
Where else would I be?

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.891
If the system is a lie, automated...

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.481
how do we know
if there's anyone else out there?

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.920
We don't.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.722
We don't know anything.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.690
We might be the only ones left alive.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.242
My God.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.846
I'm running low on air.

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.970
- I'm on my way back.
- I'll be waiting.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:20.725
As you always say, "Give it enough time,
everything's gonna break."

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.081
Guess where I found this?

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:44.964
I don't know, where?

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.122
In the toolbox, where I put it.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:51.287
And I remember putting the toolbox...

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:56.162
right next to your sleep tank,
within easy reach.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.651
Okay, so what is your point?

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.569
Yeah, I couldn't believe it either...

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.680
so I checked the video recording.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.406
- Just a minute, let's talk about this.
- Don't bother.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.689
You should see the look on your face.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.886
You going nuts, buddy?
Or did you really try to kill me?

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.162
Just let me in. We can talk about it.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:28.729
Let you in? You have gone nuts.
No, you're a danger to me.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.685
You're a danger to the sleepers.
You're a danger to this whole facility.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:36.645
- Bauer, please.
- It's not like I'm mad at you.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.602
No, I take it back.
I'm pretty mad at you.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.689
Give me a chance to explain
what happened.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.680
No second chances.

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:50.249
Think of it as a mercy killing...

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.567
like I should have done with my family.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.880
Nice chatting with you, buddy.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.801
Where you gonna go? You've got no air!

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.844
I'm here.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.330
- Where am I going, Abby?
- Breathe.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.209
Just look.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.847
You know what hurts the most?

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.369
The betrayal and the lies.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.283
I trusted you.
And you turned your back on me?

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.971
Look, there's nothing out there.
There's nowhere to go.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.687
Why don't you come back here?

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.968
How does it feel, knowing
you're gonna die out there?

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.282
Answer me!

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.921
I made it, Abby.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.925
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.641
Cartwright?

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.248
Did I get you?

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.927
Vincent Bauer,
you don't have to do this.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.364
- We might be the only ones left alive.
- Yeah?

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.803
Is that what you were thinking
when I was laying there dying?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.480
When you were looking
at your little photo?

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.010
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.245
Yeah, we both did.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:53.128
All right, enough of this
cat and mouse crap.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.086
You know I can't let this go, right?

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.847
Go lay back down in my tank...

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.609
see if my best friend's
gonna kill me in my sleep?

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:59.207
Cartwright! Don't make me hunt you
like a goddamn animal!

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:25.603
If you don't do this, he'll kill you.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.681
It'll be quick. It'll be painless.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.725
You have to do this for us.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.487
You know how much this hurts me?

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.161
- We're supposed to be family! Family!
- Yes, she needs me!

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.691
- Look, look!
- Goddamn it!

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.130
She does. I promised her. Look, look,
listen, I can explain everything.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.847
Look, please understand.
Please, she needs me. I promised!

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.691
Abby, honey,
I promise I'll never leave you.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.121
- I promised I'd never leave you.
- Who are you talking to?

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.049
- I'll never leave you, Abby.
- Who are you talking to?

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.287
I'm sorry, Abby!

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.649
- I'll never leave you, I'm sorry!
- There's nobody here! Nobody here!

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.963
Son of a bitch.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.444
Cartwright?

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.368
I know you're in here, buddy.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.002
You think I'm stupid?

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.161
Think I wouldn't figure it out?

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.685
At least now I know why this stupid job
is so important to you.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.651
She was here all along, huh?

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.442
Your lovely wife?

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.649
You didn't want to decide
who lives and who dies?

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.684
Well, that's what it's come to.

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.809
Cartwright.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.448
Come out here right now, we'll end this.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.167
I'll kill her.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.761
You don't think I'll do it?

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.284
I'll punch a hole
right between her eyes.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.130
You should see the look
on your face right now.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.090
My ticket to paradise?

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.888
- Come on, man.
- No, no, no.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.128
Take care of your girl.

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.611
Go on, man, the clock's ticking.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:01.047
I'm alive, Abby.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.002
But it's just me now.

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:12.931
Keeping this place functional.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.801
Talking to myself.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.203
Sleeping in the bed of the man I killed.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.328
Just me now.

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.129
And time.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.964
Abby.
