01:24.585 --> 01:27.154
Kade was born
with a head full of hair,

that we needed help

between $6 and $6.50

we sell up to $14.

as a new brand,

05:04.971 --> 05:06.373
we had to drive
brand awareness, right?

05:43.410 --> 05:45.512

marketing thing

05:45.512 --> 05:46.880
is you should look
at a quick glance

and know what something is
like that.

stands for.
But I feel this is
a super-competitive space.

you're gonna be able

your way through" type guy,

the narrow niche aspect of it.

to take on all those products.

So, we are.

start somewhere.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.664

07:44.664 --> 07:47.968
Our goal is to create
holistic solutions

07:47.968 --> 07:50.804
from very early on, baby, all
the way up until their teens.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.172

ask for 3.1%?

16:51.744 --> 16:53.946
and we scientifically,
in software, tailor it

16:53.946 --> 16:55.915
to the loud noises
that scare them the most.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.316
John: How tight do you need
to put it on

16:57.316 --> 16:59.552
before they obviously try
to take it off by themselves?

16:59.552 --> 17:01.687
Yeah, so we have
the four different sizes,

17:01.687 --> 17:03.422
and we also will do custom fits

17:03.422 --> 17:06.092
because not all dogs' ears
are in the same place.

17:06.092 --> 17:09.795
So tell us what happens if a dog
is hearing fireworks,

17:09.795 --> 17:11.163
really loud sounds.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.099
Does it actually
really hurt them?

17:13.099 --> 17:15.535
Yes, they hear more than we do,
and they hear it further away,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.870
so they're alerting us
most of the time.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.939
But what also is going on
is that they're having

17:19.939 --> 17:21.240
a stressful reaction.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.376
And just like us,
they're releasing cortisol

17:23.376 --> 17:24.644
into their system,

17:24.644 --> 17:27.914
which then over time
also intensifies the noise.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.181
So then it's a vicious cycle

17:29.181 --> 17:30.516
where they've
conditioned themself

17:30.516 --> 17:33.219
that since the noise is loud,
then they're more scared.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.488
Tell us about you.
What's your background?

17:35.488 --> 17:37.657
So I was in the pet industry
at Mars Petcare,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.625
doing research and development
for the last nine years,

17:39.625 --> 17:41.294
so from a consumer side...
There you go.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.828
...I not only am a client --

17:42.828 --> 17:44.730
So you have a ton of experience
in this.
Yes.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.666
What does it sell for?
What does it cost you?

17:46.666 --> 17:50.136
It is $199 direct to consumer
on our e-commerce site...

17:50.136 --> 17:51.871
Ohh.
...and landed, it's $108.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.539
Oh, so you don't have tons
of margins.

17:53.539 --> 17:56.108
Currently, I am buying
all minimum order quantities,

17:56.108 --> 17:57.476
and I know we have a lot of room

17:57.476 --> 17:59.712
to bring down all the costs
and increase the margins.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.280
So why don't you
sell it for more?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.983
I think $200 for doggy
headphones are expensive.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.851
Yeah, but you got to be able to
afford it in the first place.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.787
Yes.
It's not cheap, no matter
how you look at it, right?

18:07.787 --> 18:11.057
Yes, so we wanted to start
with a reasonable price point

18:11.057 --> 18:13.926
and get a minimum
viable product out there.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.294
How long
have you been selling?

18:15.294 --> 18:16.796
We're about a year in.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.098
And how much
have you sold?
$106,000 in sales.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.399
Okay.
Wow. That's not bad.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.735
O'Leary: On your website,
do I actually get some video

18:22.735 --> 18:25.271
of dogs that are now, you know,
accustomed like --

18:25.271 --> 18:27.073
Is it Emma?
Yeah, Emma.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.041
I mean, Emma's now
used to that thing.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.376
Emma hates it.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.011
I guess the drugs
are wearing off.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.679
Greiner:
She's so cute.

18:33.679 --> 18:34.914
[ Laughter ]

18:34.914 --> 18:36.782
She wants to know
what's going on.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.317
Cuban:
"I'm free! I'm free!"

18:38.317 --> 18:39.685
Oh, she's hurt?
John: What's wrong?

18:39.685 --> 18:42.388
She's 15 years old, and
with that comes some ailments,

18:42.388 --> 18:44.624
like a little arthritis,
but she's doing fine.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.158
She looks good
for her age.
Thank you.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.660
She does
and absolutely adorable.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.962
Well, I mean,
the credibility of it --

18:49.962 --> 18:51.831
I know, like, they're joking
and all of that.

18:51.831 --> 18:55.167
But technically, I know,
because there's other products

18:55.167 --> 18:58.337
on the market
that are to calm dogs.

18:58.337 --> 19:01.273
Yes.
So I think that
there's credibility in this.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.508
I just don't know --

19:02.508 --> 19:04.577
The price point
is what sticks me

19:04.577 --> 19:07.546
because people might
shy away from it

19:07.546 --> 19:09.315
because it's just
too costly.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.952
Yes, so at $199,
we found that people

19:12.952 --> 19:14.820
then see that it's credible.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.055
So as an engineer, you know,

19:16.055 --> 19:18.357
I wanted to throw
the kitchen sink at it, too,

19:18.357 --> 19:20.126
which was gonna
make it very costly.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.862
But this also gives us a runway
for a pipeline

19:22.862 --> 19:25.564
to have a 2.0 and a 3.0.

19:25.564 --> 19:29.301
Kirsten, I love animals.
I love dogs especially.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.203
Emma is beautiful.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.506
I think the padding alone
could work.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.542
I think if you sold this
for $30 to $40,

19:36.542 --> 19:38.177
it would open up
your market.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.880
I think at the price point,
the noise canceling,

19:40.880 --> 19:43.849
you're a niche of a niche
of a niche of a market.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.785
I don't see it.
I'm out.

19:45.785 --> 19:46.952
Okay.

19:46.952 --> 19:50.656
Emma, I think your background
fits this perfectly,

19:50.656 --> 19:54.260
and I think that this --
honestly, this looks so cute on.

19:54.260 --> 19:57.930
I could totally see this just
being passed on social media

19:57.930 --> 19:59.632
just for how adorable it is.

19:59.632 --> 20:03.102
But I don't know that you need
to have the electronics in it.

20:03.102 --> 20:06.138
If your price point was
something like $29 dollars...

20:06.138 --> 20:09.275
Yes.
...you'd sell thousands
and thousands of them.

20:09.275 --> 20:13.012
And so for me, just because
where it's at right now,

20:13.012 --> 20:16.882
I just have a different vision
for it, and I'm out.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.018
That's okay.
You may come back in, though.

20:19.018 --> 20:23.422
I think the trying
to explain this in an easy way

20:23.422 --> 20:26.158
will be challenging
from a marketing standpoint.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.730
I just don't think it's for me.
I'm out.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.797
Okay. Fair enough.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.733
Emma, I look for three things
in a product.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.801
One, is it unique
and differentiated?

20:35.801 --> 20:36.969
Yes.
That it is, yes.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.138
Two, can the entrepreneur
and founder sell it?

20:39.138 --> 20:41.540
You can,
but the third part is,

20:41.540 --> 20:44.744
I have to be able to sell it
and be excited about it.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.712
And it's just not
in my wheelhouse.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.381
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.

20:49.381 --> 20:52.284
O'Leary: So when I actually
saw it and you came in here,

20:52.284 --> 20:53.786
I thought,
"Okay, this is a joke.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.755
It's funny."
But you're serious.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.824
Yes.
And I believe you
as an engineer.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.092
I get it.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.763
I just don't need doggy
headphones in my portfolio now.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.632
It's just not for me.
I'm out.

21:06.632 --> 21:08.100
Okay.
But thank you.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.302
Emma,
we're gonna miss you.

21:10.302 --> 21:11.470
Well, thank you, everyone.

21:11.470 --> 21:12.571
Good luck.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.210
You did good out there.
You tried to help me sell it.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.912
Maybe it's not for everybody.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.014
We're gonna take into
consideration all the feedback

21:22.014 --> 21:24.383
and we're gonna
come back stronger than ever.

Hi, Sharks.
My name is Diana Jarrar.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.345
I'm originally
from Damascus, Syria,

21:53.345 --> 21:56.148
and I'm here seeking $150,000

21:56.148 --> 21:59.118
in exchange for 10%
equity in my company.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.587
Growing up in the Middle East,
my beautiful homeland

22:01.587 --> 22:03.722
had everything to offer
under the sun,

22:03.722 --> 22:06.225
including a sweet
and indulgent treat.

22:06.225 --> 22:09.295
All you had to do was pick it
from a palm tree.

22:09.295 --> 22:13.299
Sharks, I'm talking about
the date fruit.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.935
These sweet, resilient,
and wrinkly treats

22:15.935 --> 22:19.605
nourished my body and spirit
with each and every single bite.

22:19.605 --> 22:22.041
And that's how Magic Dates
was born.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.610
We've taken divine dates
and blended them

22:24.610 --> 22:27.546
with crunchy walnuts,
cacao nibs, coconut.

22:27.546 --> 22:33.285
And get this -- We covered them
in rich 100% dark chocolate.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.154
And when it comes to
our satiating treats,

22:35.154 --> 22:39.358
you can say no to added sugars,
no to dairy, no to gluten,

22:39.358 --> 22:42.628
and yes to real whole
flavorful foods.

22:42.628 --> 22:45.331
Sharks, I'm on a mission

Herjavec:
Which is the most popular?

23:01.580 --> 23:03.649
So the Triple Chocolate Crunch.

23:03.649 --> 23:05.551
That's the one
I went right for first.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.853
Oh, of course you did.
The chocolate on chocolate
on chocolate.

23:07.853 --> 23:09.255
The coconut's good.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.924
Oh, wow.
The Lush Lemon one is fantastic.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.727
That's one of
my favorites.
I like the Triple Chocolate.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.295
Diana,
how many calories?

23:16.295 --> 23:18.564
So in our original line that's
not covered in chocolate,

23:18.564 --> 23:20.799
per serving, that's two bites,
is 100 calories,

23:20.799 --> 23:22.668
and the chocolate-covered
variety's 120 calories.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.837
Is that a lot?
That sounds like a lot.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.872
So here's the thing --
nutrient density

23:26.872 --> 23:28.908
is about a lot more
than just calories.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.610
These are no added sugar,
and they're chock-full of fiber,

23:31.610 --> 23:33.712
which we are
a fiber-deficient country.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.881
And in just one serving
of Magic Dates,

23:35.881 --> 23:37.383
you're getting 15% to 20%

23:37.383 --> 23:40.119
of the daily recommended value
of fiber.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.587
How did you get
into this business?

23:41.587 --> 23:44.256
I have a bit of a path, but I'll
start at the end for you, Mark,

23:44.256 --> 23:45.791
because point of inspiration
for me

23:45.791 --> 23:47.293
was actually one
of your entrepreneurs.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.628
So several years ago,
before I started Magic Dates,

23:49.628 --> 23:52.364
I had taken my LSAT,
I was on my way to law school,

23:52.364 --> 23:53.766
and a friend of mine
approached me

23:53.766 --> 23:57.603
to help him help an entrepreneur
come up with a vegan recipe

23:57.603 --> 23:59.571
for her paleo
ice cream sandwich company.

23:59.571 --> 24:00.839
Frankie?
Frankie.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.841
Yeah, and, Diana, just
real quick so everybody knows.

24:02.841 --> 24:05.577
Yeah.
Frankie came on two seasons ago
with Coconut Girl,

24:05.577 --> 24:09.114
which were these amazing
ice cream sandwiches

24:09.114 --> 24:10.549
that were healthy for you.

24:10.549 --> 24:11.884
And so she's doing great.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.053
We just sold part of the
company, she's doing so well.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.120
That's incredible.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.722
So I met Frankie.
I went to her kitchen.

24:16.722 --> 24:18.457
I told my friend, "You have me
for a couple of months.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.658
I'm applying to law school.

24:19.658 --> 24:21.627
I'm gonna study
international human rights law,"

24:21.627 --> 24:23.262
and I just fell
in love with this.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.698
It was like a whole new world
had opened up to me.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.967
And, you know,
going back a little bit further,

24:27.967 --> 24:30.736
when I moved on my own to L. A.
when I was 19,

24:30.736 --> 24:33.205
food became a connector for me.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.075
I learned how to make all my
mom's best Arabic food recipes

24:36.075 --> 24:37.209
and I would invite friends over,

24:37.209 --> 24:38.677
and that's how
I would connect with them.

24:38.677 --> 24:40.479
And that's my intention
with Magic Dates.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.715
And really,
dates are the perfect vehicle

24:42.715 --> 24:43.916
because, as you may know,

24:43.916 --> 24:45.985
they have a history
in the Middle East

24:45.985 --> 24:47.886
of thousands of years
of cultivation,

24:47.886 --> 24:49.888
and they came here
just a hundred years ago.

24:49.888 --> 24:53.826
An agriculture explorer brought
11 shoots from Morocco,

24:53.826 --> 24:55.427
and they thrived
in Coachella Valley

24:55.427 --> 24:57.329
'cause it was so hot and dry.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.531
And that's why we have 95%
of the crop

24:59.531 --> 25:01.033
being grown here in California.
Really?

25:01.033 --> 25:03.402
You learn something new
on "Shark Tank" every day.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.504
Give us an idea of what's
going on in distribution,

25:05.504 --> 25:06.872
sales, margins, et cetera.

25:06.872 --> 25:09.675
Yeah, so it was
a completely grassroots effort.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.544
I launched at the
farmers market, and in 2018,

25:12.544 --> 25:15.347
I got into the first
30 doors here in L. A.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.949
And what were sales
in 2018?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.884
So in 2018, $30,000.

25:18.884 --> 25:21.653
And then in 2019,
we did $100,000.

25:21.653 --> 25:24.256
And then 2020,
we did $136,000.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.257
-Yeah.
-Ooh.

25:25.257 --> 25:26.825
So that was up 30%.

25:26.825 --> 25:28.127
Is this all retail
at this point?

25:28.127 --> 25:29.194
This is all retail.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.896
There's nothing
direct to consumer?

25:30.896 --> 25:32.598
We did very little
direct to consumer

25:32.598 --> 25:35.067
'cause I was just not
focusing my resources.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.336
And, Diana, this year,
what are you tracking at?

25:37.336 --> 25:41.273
This year, we're projecting
to close at $175,000.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.342
-That's interesting.
-Diana, what do these cost?

25:43.342 --> 25:45.077
You never told us what they
sell for and what they cost.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.379
Yeah, so the cost
out of the manufacturer,

25:47.379 --> 25:49.314
out the door landed is $1.60.

25:49.314 --> 25:52.051
And they're retail
between $4.99 and $5.99.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.252
Oh, your margins
are great.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.320
Yeah, we have 42%
to 48% margins.
Right.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.057
And we are focusing more
on direct to consumer now.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.458
And what I'd like
to share with you --

25:59.458 --> 26:00.726
I think this would be
a good time

26:00.726 --> 26:02.728
to reveal a bit of a secret.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.396
What are you
holding back?

26:04.396 --> 26:07.833
We have been marketing
under a different look.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.735
-Would you like to see it?
-Sure.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.437
Sorry,
these are the old?

26:11.437 --> 26:12.971
No, these are the new.
Okay.

26:12.971 --> 26:14.540
These are the Glengarry bags.
I'm gonna show you the old now.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.908
Ah!
Greiner: Alright,
let's see the old.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.843
Thank you.
Mark.

26:18.944 --> 26:20.412
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.315
I realized that with our old
branding and packaging

26:23.315 --> 26:25.717
and messaging, we weren't
quite hitting the values.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.119
O'Leary: So you upgraded
your packaging.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.988
Is it proven to give you
better sell-through?

26:29.988 --> 26:31.223
You're literally
the first people

26:31.223 --> 26:32.724
to be holding it in your hands.

26:32.724 --> 26:34.593
I actually like
this packaging better.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.962
You see what it is.
It's light.

26:36.962 --> 26:39.832
And "Magic Dates"
pops really well.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.066
Cuban: I agree with Lori.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.802
I like the old packaging better
for the same reasons.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.838
Okay.
But when you change packaging,

26:45.838 --> 26:48.807
it's never an indication
that sales are booming, right?

26:48.807 --> 26:50.142
It's an indication like,
"Okay,

26:50.142 --> 26:51.577
they're not where
we want them to be.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.278
Let's try to do something."

26:53.278 --> 26:54.279
Yeah.
Right?

26:54.279 --> 26:56.882
And so while I think
it's a good product,

26:56.882 --> 26:59.618
there is just not that one thing
that's in the headline

26:59.618 --> 27:01.520
that just says,
"I have to try these."

27:01.520 --> 27:02.988
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

27:02.988 --> 27:04.590
Okay, thank you, Mark.
But good luck,
and congratulations.

27:04.590 --> 27:05.924
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.926
Herjavec: Yeah, Diana,
you're definitely on trend.

27:07.926 --> 27:14.099
But as an investor, I don't see
the growth or the early hit.

27:14.099 --> 27:16.869
I don't see the catalyst
right now.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.537
I'm out.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.105
Dates are really
not my space.

27:20.105 --> 27:21.406
It's just not something for me
at the moment.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.542
I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
Appreciate it.

27:23.542 --> 27:27.746
You know, Diana, you gave up
international human rights law.

27:27.746 --> 27:30.449
That is something so needed
and so important,

27:30.449 --> 27:32.451
and in this arena,

27:32.451 --> 27:35.721
there's tons of date-like
products and treats.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.389
Mm-hmm.
I've seen lots of them.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.726
If it were me,
I would say,

27:40.726 --> 27:42.327
I think the other career path

27:42.327 --> 27:46.098
is something that is
really just so important

27:46.098 --> 27:48.133
and something
you'd be so great at.

27:48.133 --> 27:52.237
Lori Greiner is saying
to walk away from your business?

27:52.237 --> 27:53.972
To take it out
behind the barn?

27:53.972 --> 27:58.043
Honestly, I honestly am saying,
go with your passions,

27:58.043 --> 27:59.545
do what you want.

27:59.545 --> 28:02.347
But I feel, because
this is such a crowded space,

28:02.347 --> 28:04.917
I'm sorry, I'm out.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.452
Thank you, Lori.
I really respect your feedback.

Diana, it's very impressive.
Your passion is clear.

28:09.988 --> 28:15.227

background, being half Lebanese,

28:15.227 --> 28:16.728

with the region,

28:16.728 --> 28:19.498
and you're very impressive.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.134
I'm sorry, but I'm underwhelmed
with the sales.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.802
You know, I was actually
sitting on the fence

28:23.802 --> 28:25.103
trying to figure
this one out.

28:25.103 --> 28:27.272
We've been at Whole Foods
for almost over a year now,

28:27.272 --> 28:28.540
and it moves really well there.

28:28.540 --> 28:29.875
I've re-shifted focus this year.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.444
So instead of going out
to get more retail accounts,

28:32.444 --> 28:35.080
I wanted to approach the digital
marketing and e-commerce space.
Cuban: Smart. That's smart.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.149
I get it,
but this is such a tough slog.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.151
I mean, I love your story.
I eat dates.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.119
I understand the merits of them.
I get it.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.755

I'm just having
a real hard time with it.

28:43.755 --> 28:46.491
You know, I'm gonna
make you an offer

28:46.491 --> 28:47.593
commensurate
with the risk.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.895
$150,000 for 33 1/3%.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.563
I'll take a third
of the business.
Yeah.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.799
-That's actually not horrible.
-That's not a bad offer.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.267
I don't want to give up
a third of my company.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.202
I came in here like, "Don't give
up a third of your company."

28:57.202 --> 29:00.138
'Cause the thing is, I have to
also value what I know I can do.

on 33%?

33:44.756 --> 33:45.891
I'm an athlete.

33:45.891 --> 33:47.993
I got a million followers.
What happens?

33:47.993 --> 33:50.262
We bring in artists
from the outside.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.731
How do you split the revenue
between you,

33:52.731 --> 33:54.466
the artist,
and the athlete?

33:54.466 --> 33:57.869
This basketball, as an example,
is $15 to make...
Okay.

33:57.869 --> 34:01.139
...and we sell it
for $59.99 retail.

34:01.139 --> 34:03.174
The artist gets two options.

34:03.174 --> 34:04.876
They either get
a flat fee up front

34:04.876 --> 34:07.946
or they get 10% share
in revenue of every unit sold.

34:07.946 --> 34:11.116
And so can you walk us
through your overall revenue?
Greiner: That's a good deal.

34:11.116 --> 34:14.486
How much have you sold
in physical goods and NFTs?

34:14.486 --> 34:17.822
Yeah, so I've sold 354,000
life to date,

34:17.822 --> 34:20.559
which is 15 months
of physical goods.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.693
Units or dollars?

34:21.693 --> 34:22.861
Sorry, that's dollars.
Okay.

34:22.861 --> 34:26.565
And how much is NFTs
on top of the $354,000?

34:26.565 --> 34:31.303
Right now, the NFTs are growing
into 20K of our total revenue.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.038
That's above and beyond
the $354,000.

34:33.038 --> 34:34.539
So it's small.
It's very small.

34:34.539 --> 34:35.307
Very small.
Got it.

34:35.307 --> 34:36.541
So tell us about you.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.510
How did you come up with this
in the first place?

34:38.510 --> 34:40.779
So I have to go back
to my roots.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.615
I'm born and raised
in small-town Oklahoma

34:43.615 --> 34:45.016
to parents from India,

34:45.016 --> 34:48.320
where being different sometimes
meant you didn't belong,

34:48.320 --> 34:51.089
and I found who I was
through basketball.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.425
I played in high school,
I played overseas,

34:53.425 --> 34:54.926
and then I coached
at the collegiate

34:54.926 --> 34:56.194
and high school level.

34:56.194 --> 34:59.397
I then transitioned
to the marketing side of sports,

34:59.397 --> 35:01.666
which led me to marketing
leadership roles

35:01.666 --> 35:04.235
at Reebok, Hasbro.
Oh, wow.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.504
Under Armour,
I led marketing for six years,

35:06.504 --> 35:09.441
and most recently was vice
president of brand at Peloton.
Really?

35:09.441 --> 35:10.475
Wow.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.711
What are your sales
year to date?

35:12.711 --> 35:15.246
We're on track --
our run rate is $510,000.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.215
How much are you
going to make on that?

35:17.215 --> 35:19.517
We're currently,
at a gross profit level --

35:19.517 --> 35:23.355
$73,000 in gross profit
at the product level.
Gross profit or net profit?

35:23.355 --> 35:25.757
We are not profitable
as a company.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.225
So how much
are you burning?

35:27.225 --> 35:29.594
We're burning about
$10,000 a month right now.

35:29.594 --> 35:31.062
How much money
have you raised?

35:31.062 --> 35:35.033
So I just closed a round
at $1.39 million.

35:35.033 --> 35:38.303
I raised on a SAFE
at a 6.25% post-money --

35:38.303 --> 35:39.838
What are the terms
of your SAFE?

35:39.838 --> 35:41.840
6.25% post-money SAFE.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.908
Okay.
Standard Y Combinator SAFE.

35:43.908 --> 35:48.947
You know, I think you are
so impressive and so spot-on.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.483
As far as an investment
for me,

35:51.483 --> 35:53.218
I think that some
of my fellow Sharks

35:53.218 --> 35:54.619
might be a better partner
for you

35:54.619 --> 35:57.622
because they know more
about sports than I do.

35:57.622 --> 36:00.258
For those reasons,
I think I will go out,

36:00.258 --> 36:02.594
because I think you'll have
even someone stronger

36:02.594 --> 36:03.895
to help support you.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.397
Ohh!

36:05.397 --> 36:07.932
Jasmine, I have a huge amount
of respect for your background.

36:07.932 --> 36:09.634
Thank you.
Really, really impressive.

36:09.634 --> 36:13.071
And what a unique
business model.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.973
Is it gonna work?
I don't know.

36:14.973 --> 36:19.210
But the road to revenue
is not clear for me.

36:19.210 --> 36:20.912
Before you go out,
before you go out,

36:20.912 --> 36:23.081
I want to talk about
our strategic partnerships

36:23.081 --> 36:24.983
at the wholesale level
for volume.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.485
Yeah, Jasmine, I'm not your guy
for this.

36:27.485 --> 36:29.154
I'm sorry.
I'm out.

36:29.154 --> 36:30.622
Ohh!

36:30.622 --> 36:31.656
Okay.

36:31.656 --> 36:32.724
John: You're the real deal.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.459
I think NFTs are gonna
be around forever.

36:34.459 --> 36:35.960
Everybody's
gonna own one.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.229
But I'm trying to educate myself
still on them,

36:38.229 --> 36:41.366
and at a buy-in price
of $250,000,

36:41.366 --> 36:43.368
I would be giving you
that for tuition.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.037
I wouldn't add any value
at this moment.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.973
It's a little too early for me
to get a full grasp.

36:48.973 --> 36:52.944
Daymond, we are betting on the
passion people have for sports.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.747
The revenue is rooted
in physicals.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.649
The NFT is upside.
It's in the physical?

36:57.649 --> 36:59.217
This is sports fashion.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.719
This is absolutely
self-expression.

37:00.719 --> 37:05.423
But I think the NFT part
is the really attractive part,

37:05.423 --> 37:07.258
but I don't know
enough about it.

37:07.258 --> 37:08.393
So I'm out.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.731
Jasmine,
why aren't your sales higher?

37:12.731 --> 37:14.699
We actually are
on our third PO

37:14.699 --> 37:17.602
with the largest sporting
goods retailer in America.

37:17.602 --> 37:21.306
They want to co-create product
with us in 2022 and beyond.

37:21.306 --> 37:23.742
They also have an open order
for next year

37:23.742 --> 37:26.644
that just came in this morning
of $100,000.

37:26.644 --> 37:28.680
But see, but those numbers
aren't big enough to scale,

37:28.680 --> 37:30.315
particularly
with your valuation.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.283
Look, we do some of this stuff
with the Mavs.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.719
I do a lot of stuff
with unlocking NFTs.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.121
It'd be
somewhat competitive.

37:36.121 --> 37:39.257
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.558
O'Leary: Okay, Jasmine.

37:40.558 --> 37:42.827
Herjavec:
The sporty Shark is left.

37:42.827 --> 37:46.030
I own the domain for NFT.
I own the URL.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.566
I've built a business around it
with lots of partners.

37:48.566 --> 37:51.136
We have reserved all
the S&P 500 companies,

37:51.136 --> 37:53.438
and so that part fits
with what I'm doing

37:53.438 --> 37:55.106
and have already
invested a lot in.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.375
I'm trying to figure out
how to make that work

37:57.375 --> 38:02.213
so that when you offer
any athlete an NFT profile,

38:02.213 --> 38:03.481
it goes up on the website.

38:03.481 --> 38:05.884
John: But if you own
all the 500 companies,

38:05.884 --> 38:07.552
you didn't get all their
permission, are you a troll?

38:07.552 --> 38:09.287
We've reserved it
for them,

38:09.287 --> 38:10.722
and they can decide
to use it or not.
Herjavec: Definitely a troll.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.357
You reserved it for them.

38:12.357 --> 38:13.792
Cuban: Yeah, right?
Definitely a troll.
There's no squatters.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.860
But let me finish.
Definitely
a domain name hack.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.163
You are witnessing a troll
in real life.

38:18.163 --> 38:20.131
O'Leary: Look,
I have those domains.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.133
and my point is,
I don't steal it from them.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.401
If they want to work
with us, great.

38:23.401 --> 38:26.971
But I'm not gonna go to work
for you, Jasmine, for 3%,

38:26.971 --> 38:28.473
because your business
is nascent,

38:28.473 --> 38:30.308
it's early,
it's start-up.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.611
You're very impressive,
but I'm not doing it for 3%.

38:33.611 --> 38:35.280
Okay.
Okay, that's just not enough

38:35.280 --> 38:37.182
to get me out of bed
to go work for you.

38:37.182 --> 38:38.616
Greiner:
Give her an offer.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.218
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.987
I'm gonna do $250,000
for 15%.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.889
Cuban:
You got to say yes to that.

38:44.889 --> 38:46.558
You should take that deal.
You got to.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.827
You got to.
I don't have any flexibility,

38:48.827 --> 38:50.962
but basically I'm giving you
a quarter of a million dollars

38:50.962 --> 38:54.032
and then going to work
for you.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.366
What do you want to do?

Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.

on the table from Kevin

You got to.

You got to.

First thing that happens

39:23.595 --> 39:25.830
is we figure out a strategy
to blow you up.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.031
I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy,

39:27.031 --> 39:28.833

for you, Jasmine.

39:28.833 --> 39:30.268
<i>I'm</i> working for <i>you.</i>

39:30.268 --> 39:31.603
I wonder if I can
get a paycheck.

Can I get on payroll?

39:32.904 --> 39:35.006

Nothing proprietary
about that. Sorry.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.283
I have digital --
You also have an offer.

39:45.283 --> 39:46.985
Jasmine,
you can counter.

39:46.985 --> 39:50.655
I am thinking about
what would be respectful.

39:50.655 --> 39:56.995
Would you do $250,000
for...

39:56.995 --> 40:00.365
5% with an advisory share and...
No.

40:00.365 --> 40:01.900
You got to get me
to 15%.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.835
You can structure it
any way you want,

40:03.835 --> 40:07.138
but I'm going to help you
build this business

40:07.138 --> 40:09.340
in a very competitive space.

40:09.340 --> 40:14.879
Would you consider
$250,000 for...

40:14.879 --> 40:17.582
5% with an advisory share

40:17.582 --> 40:20.418
and 1% of every NFT...

40:20.418 --> 40:22.186
Greiner: Ever sold?
...ever sold.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.622
Okay, so, Jasmine, you're
talking about a royalty deal,

40:24.622 --> 40:27.258
and that resonates
with Mr. Wonderful, okay?

40:27.258 --> 40:29.494
All of a sudden,
I'm loving you more now.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.496
So I would do this deal,
okay?

40:31.496 --> 40:36.868
I'll do $250,000
for 11%

40:36.868 --> 40:41.406
and 2%
of every NFT sold.

40:41.406 --> 40:44.175
At the 11% --

40:44.175 --> 40:45.610
You should take that deal.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.745
It is a down round
for my current investors.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.314
I understand,
and I respect the investors,

40:49.314 --> 40:51.449
but I'm Mr. Wonderful.
You knew that coming in,
though, Jasmine.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.750
You knew that coming in.

40:52.750 --> 40:53.818
I know, I know.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.219
Look,
I respect your investors,

they can't bring, okay?

40:57.655 --> 41:00.258
They just can't.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.093
I think the URL
is very valuable for you.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.562
I think the infrastructure
that I have already

41:04.562 --> 41:06.664
to build out this NFT complex
for you.

41:06.664 --> 41:08.566
I literally --
I know you're struggling
with it.

41:08.566 --> 41:11.102
I would take the 11% deal
and the 2% NFTs.

41:11.102 --> 41:13.137
I would do that if I were you.
I really would.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.707
All your investors,
they get a discount, right,

41:15.707 --> 41:17.041
to the next round.
Yes. Yeah. They do.

41:17.041 --> 41:20.545
So if this prices
at a lower amount,

41:20.545 --> 41:23.114
they actually get
more of the company.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.282
-Right, so you lose.
-Right.

41:24.282 --> 41:25.516
I know.
They don't.

41:25.516 --> 41:26.718
I know.
Right?

41:26.718 --> 41:28.119
You got to make
a decision.

41:28.119 --> 41:29.554
But I'm willing
to do it at 10%.

41:29.554 --> 41:31.622
I don't care how many advisory
shares are in that mix.

41:31.622 --> 41:35.126
And I want 1.5%

41:35.126 --> 41:36.327

41:36.327 --> 41:37.395
