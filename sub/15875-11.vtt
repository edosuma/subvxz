it is like-- I owe you kudos.

07:48.234 --> 07:49.035
JOHN CENA: Yeah.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.437
Thank you.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.237
Yeah, absolutely.

NATALYA (VOICEOVER):
I don't think

08:02.515 --> 08:06.186
there is a spot harder to
follow in the history of WWE.

08:09.756 --> 08:10.557
VINNIE: Oh, babe.

08:10.557 --> 08:11.358
Don't cry.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.192
I didn't mean--

CAMERON (VOICEOVER):
I've never told any guy

08:13.660 --> 08:14.694
that I've ever loved them.

08:17.864 --> 08:20.166
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER): That
face of my husband right

08:20.166 --> 08:21.901
now, I will never forget.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.837

I'm hungry.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.049
I know.
I'm starving.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.284
Thank you.
Ladies first.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.085
Oh, no.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.520
It's me.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.721
CAMERON: Oh my gosh.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.655
CAMERON (VOICEOVER): Since my
mom's here for WrestleMania,

08:43.655 --> 08:46.159
to celebrate I decided
that I want to take my mom

08:46.159 --> 08:47.861
and Vinnie out for
some yummy din din.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.129
That was a stank kiss, babe.

08:49.129 --> 08:49.929
I need a better.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.197
I'm going to be making
out putting my tongue--

08:51.197 --> 08:52.799
CAMERON: I know, but you could
at least give me a better one.

08:52.799 --> 08:53.733
--when your mom
is sitting there.

08:53.733 --> 08:54.501
OK.
She wants a better kiss.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.468
It's OK.
I don't mind.

08:55.468 --> 08:56.603
VINNIE: Oh, come on.
Your mom is sitting there.

08:56.603 --> 08:57.737
CAMERON: A better kiss.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.172
VINNIE: OK, come here.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.106
See, that was better.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.274
VINNIE: All right.
Cheers.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.208
Cheers.
-Yay!

09:02.208 --> 09:03.510
Mom and daughter.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.310
To WrestleMania week.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.311
Yeah, WrestleMania.

09:05.311 --> 09:06.913
She's going to get
the title match.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.548
I'm so excited for that.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.349
VINNIE: I know.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.150
Oh, I love you, Mommy.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.951
I love you, Ari.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.753
So you do say I love you.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.225
CAMERON: No, but he knows
how much I care for him.

09:19.225 --> 09:23.196
TAMMY: I know, but
sometimes it's good to hear.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.197
You know?

09:24.197 --> 09:27.133
CAMERON: In my defense,
I've never told any guy

09:27.133 --> 09:28.968
that I've ever loved him, ever.

09:28.968 --> 09:32.038
For me, saying I love you is
almost like getting married.

09:32.038 --> 09:35.375
So when I do say that, it's
going to be like a big deal.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.343
CAMERON (VOICEOVER): There's
only been a few people my life

09:37.343 --> 09:38.578
that I've said I
love you to, just

09:38.578 --> 09:42.515
because of my past with my step
dad who was really mean to me.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.885
So it's hard for me to
express my feelings to people.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.122
VINNIE: Oh, babe.

09:49.122 --> 09:49.923
Don't cry.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.357
I didn't-- babe, don't cry now.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.626
You're going to--
I didn't mean--

09:53.626 --> 09:55.195
My mom's been
there for me like--

09:55.195 --> 09:55.995
VINNIE: I know.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.764
But babe--

09:57.764 --> 09:59.833
So it's easy for me to
tell my mom I love her

09:59.833 --> 10:04.104
because she was like my only
person I ever had in my life.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.806
And you feel like
you do love someone,

10:06.806 --> 10:12.178
but then it's like you get
hurt and then it's just hard.

10:12.178 --> 10:16.216
That's why my personality is
the way I am and I'm so guarded,

10:16.216 --> 10:19.486
it's because of me
only having my mom.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.887
WAITER: Sorry to interrupt.
How you all doing?

10:20.887 --> 10:21.988
How's everything?
VINNIE: Doing good, man.

10:21.988 --> 10:22.989
Thank you.
TAMMY: It's good.

10:22.989 --> 10:23.353
Thank you.

10:23.353 --> 10:25.024
And did you also want
to get a [INAUDIBLE]

10:25.024 --> 10:26.759
salad also after this one?

10:26.759 --> 10:27.627
No, it's OK.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.428
No?

10:28.428 --> 10:29.429
OK.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.797
I'm glad that we
talked about this

10:30.797 --> 10:33.800
and I'm glad that you shared--
that means a lot to me.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.535
And I still love you, babe.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.402
I still support you.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.272
And I know that you
have love for me.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.341
Regardless, I'm here for you.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.943

John seems like he's

11:19.445 --> 11:21.548

I mean, John is the
face of the company.

he has on his plate right now.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.295
I'll be fine.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.396
So you're tired?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.768
I think anyone who's
involved with any of this

11:41.768 --> 11:42.869
probably is tired.

else going on with you?

I'm currently involved in the
most awkward dinner of my life.

11:57.350 --> 12:02.255
It's not my fault.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.657
For her to tell you that
she's been married before

12:04.657 --> 12:07.627
and that had no problem with
it is like-- that's awesome

12:07.627 --> 12:08.461

I'm not upset that Brie didn't

if she was just like,
oh, we're not close.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.911
But she said she didn't
invite me to the wedding

14:38.911 --> 14:42.281

like I would ruin it.

too many people.

invite me, I'm still going to--

So I'm extending
an olive branch.

smart, because we've

15:05.738 --> 15:06.606

When people first meet you,
they think you're fake.

because of my own doing.

fair share of the bitch.

to be on number three.

is eight matches tonight

16:08.301 --> 16:12.138
and we were moved from
number three to number seven.

16:12.138 --> 16:16.008
Number seven is the one match
that can either disappear

16:16.008 --> 16:17.777
or time can get taken away.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.780
So it's the worst
match to be in.

We got cut last year because
we were second to last.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.884
Well, that was last year.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.152

26:39.198 --> 26:40.632
Maybe I'll catch up
with you guys later.

26:40.632 --> 26:41.900
I just need to lay
down or something.

the perfect evening.

Nana!

27:05.557 --> 27:07.226
Can you believe it?

27:07.226 --> 27:09.428
My grandmother, the
night she got married,

27:09.428 --> 27:12.498
her mother gave her this
robe for her wedding night.

27:12.498 --> 27:15.634
And I turned that robe into
my rehearsal dinner dress.

-You look so gorgeous.
-Oh, thank you.

amazing right now.

NIKKI BELLA (VOICEOVER):
My uncle Joe comes over

27:57.809 --> 28:01.947
and basically he's asking me
when I'm going to get married.

28:01.947 --> 28:04.116
Yeah, it makes it
a little awkward.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.817
And of course I want
to get married soon,

28:05.817 --> 28:07.819
but I just hope
this little secret

28:07.819 --> 28:10.856
that I've had for the past 10
years does ruin any of that.

now I'm not see

J. GARCIA: Him and I talked
about it at the red carpet.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.426
I told him, I'm like, you're a
better man than I am because I

29:54.426 --> 29:56.328
freaked out on Nicole.

29:56.328 --> 29:59.498
Oh my god.

Why would you say
something to him?

J. GARCIA: What do you mean?

30:20.585 --> 30:23.722
You told him and he acted great.

tell him when you said you were

going t say something to him.

30:37.035 --> 30:38.403
I asked you to do it
before my wedding.

Well, how about
I didn't want to.

to him about it.

The one thing I asked is

31:04.496 --> 31:06.932
please tell John
before my wedding.

31:06.932 --> 31:08.934
Now my brother is
a little upset.

31:08.934 --> 31:11.370
Nikki's upset that my brother
said something to John.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.739
But I'm upset at Nikki
because Nikki told me

31:13.739 --> 31:15.574
that she was going to tell John.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.410
And then my mom's upset because
us three kids are fighting.

31:18.410 --> 31:22.614
And this is exactly
what I didn't want.

31:22.614 --> 31:23.582
You said you told him.

31:23.582 --> 31:24.383
Yeah.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.183
But I lied.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.486
Well, how am I supposed
to know that you're lying?

31:27.486 --> 31:28.553
I thought all's good.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.455
Why would you go say
something to him about that?

31:30.455 --> 31:32.357
He didn't even react to me.
He acted like it was all good.

31:32.357 --> 31:33.158
Of course he did.

31:33.158 --> 31:34.326
John's a pro at doing that.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.928
John's not going to sit here
and show you that he's affected.

31:36.928 --> 31:38.697
You told me that you told
him, so course I told him.

31:38.697 --> 31:39.062
I know.

31:39.062 --> 31:40.198
But who walks up to
someone and is like,

31:40.198 --> 31:42.534
oh, it's cool, yeah,
about whatever.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.035
Why would you even say that?
-It doesn't matter.

31:44.035 --> 31:45.170
But you told me
that you told him.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.004
Hey, you guys.

31:46.004 --> 31:47.739
What's going on?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.141
JJ told John.

31:49.141 --> 31:49.908
Honey, it's--

31:49.908 --> 31:50.742
You lied.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.677
And no offense, you're just
getting caught up in your lie.

31:52.677 --> 31:53.545

31:53.545 --> 31:55.180
It's done.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.214

31:56.214 --> 31:57.449
You're going to need
to talk to John.

Yeah, but now he knows I
lied and I've been lying.

my brother that told John.

John didn't tell me.

Three, I can't believe I've
been lying this whole time.

32:27.813 --> 32:31.216
And four, I've disappointed
Brie and it's her big day.

32:31.216 --> 32:34.486
This is just the hole that
I was meant to die in.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.521
I can't believe JJ went up
and said something to him.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.890
Nicole, to be honest,
JJ's not in the wrong.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.759
We all thought you told
John because you told us.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.427

You seem like you're
in good shape.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.263

Because I wasn't.

32:46.064 --> 32:47.065
That's not bad.

32:47.065 --> 32:50.635
That means John knows and
hasn't said anything to you.

because he does keep asking me

32:53.338 --> 32:54.473
do I have anything to tell him.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.078

this whole marriage thing,

And when John and I make eye
contact for the first time,

34:08.679 --> 34:10.782
it takes my breath
away because it's such

34:10.782 --> 34:12.551
a romantic, beautiful setting.

kind of have sadness

that he knows,

truly haven't hurt him.

picture perfect setting.

35:28.994 --> 35:34.466
Bryan, being that Brianna and
Nicole are identical twins,

35:34.466 --> 35:38.536
are you completely
sure this is Brianna?

35:38.536 --> 35:39.304
I am.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.805
You are.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.074
PASTOR: Bryan, please
receive your bride and will

35:43.074 --> 35:44.943
the two of you come forward.

35:44.943 --> 35:45.744
Thank you.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.711
All right.

35:46.711 --> 35:49.648
Love you.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.549
Now Bryan and
Brianna would like

35:51.549 --> 35:55.353
to take this moment to share
some of their thoughts one

35:55.353 --> 35:56.287
with the other.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.259
I couldn't ask
for a better man,

36:01.259 --> 36:04.963
best friend, father, and husband
to spend the rest of my life

36:04.963 --> 36:05.930
with.

36:05.930 --> 36:08.633
Your humble heart
and sensitive soul

36:08.633 --> 36:11.269
has made me a better person.

36:11.269 --> 36:12.837
Every time I look
into your eyes,

36:12.837 --> 36:14.572
I immediately feel comfort.

36:14.572 --> 36:16.541
CAMERON (VOICEOVER): Seeing
Brie and Bryan together

36:16.541 --> 36:17.909
and how they're
looking at each other

36:17.909 --> 36:19.878
and how they're choking
up on their vows,

36:19.878 --> 36:21.513
it's like oh my god.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.114
This is so adorable.

36:23.114 --> 36:25.884
And it's making me reflect on
my relationship with Vinnie.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.085
And I'm just like, oh my god.

36:27.085 --> 36:28.620
Is something
happening right now?

36:28.620 --> 36:32.524
BRIE BELLA: You remind me so
much of my grandfather Papa.

36:32.524 --> 36:36.961
And I always prayed to
find someone like him.

36:36.961 --> 36:40.265
God sure did answer
my prayers and has

36:40.265 --> 36:45.937
put peace in my heart to let me
know that you're truly the one.

36:45.937 --> 36:48.740
I will love you not until
our last breath on earth,

36:48.740 --> 36:49.541
but for eternity.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.947
Today is just another
day for most people.

36:55.947 --> 36:59.551
The sun's going to rise and
the sun's going to fall,

36:59.551 --> 37:04.989
and it's different for
us today because today we

37:04.989 --> 37:07.158
exchange promises that
we're going to keep

37:07.158 --> 37:08.693
for the rest of our lives.

37:08.693 --> 37:11.463
Because when we first
kissed, I became doofier

37:11.463 --> 37:13.465
than I've ever been in my life.

37:13.465 --> 37:16.468
Holding you is the most
comforted I've ever felt.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.970
And because I've never
felt as safe crying

37:18.970 --> 37:21.606
is when I cry next to you.

37:21.606 --> 37:23.641
And watching you
walk down that aisle

37:23.641 --> 37:25.410
is the happiest I've ever been.

37:25.410 --> 37:29.147
I'm the luckiest person alive.

37:29.147 --> 37:32.016
I couldn't imagine growing
old with anybody else.

37:32.016 --> 37:32.817
I love you.

37:36.254 --> 37:40.091
PASTOR: Bryan, you
may kiss your bride.

37:40.091 --> 37:43.094
[APPLAUSE]

37:48.333 --> 37:49.801
Woo!

37:49.801 --> 37:51.002
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER):
I'm married.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.471
I am Mrs. Danielson.

37:53.471 --> 37:54.472
Yes!

37:54.472 --> 37:55.473
Yes!

37:55.473 --> 37:56.474
Yes!

37:56.474 --> 37:57.408
Yes!

37:57.408 --> 37:58.943
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER):
I am going to remember

37:58.943 --> 38:00.545
this for the rest of my life.

38:00.545 --> 38:05.683
PASTOR: I present to you Mr.
And Mrs. Bryan Lloyd Danielson.

38:05.683 --> 38:07.886
[CHEERS]

38:08.686 --> 38:12.157
[MUSIC PLAYING]

38:17.095 --> 38:18.596
Congratulations, Bryan.

38:18.596 --> 38:20.064
Thank you very much.

38:20.064 --> 38:21.566
Yeah, congratulations, Bryan.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.503
NIKKI BELLA (VOICEOVER):
Enough is enough.

38:25.503 --> 38:26.504
I'm sick of the lies.

38:26.504 --> 38:28.006
I'm sick of hiding this.

38:28.006 --> 38:31.943
I'm going straight to John
and just tell him everything.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.044
Well, I'm glad
to see you happy.

38:43.188 --> 38:45.156
NIKKI BELLA: I feel bad
that I didn't tell you.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.592
I don't need to know
everything about you.

38:47.592 --> 38:50.562
It's just when you
can tell other people.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.923
[MUSIC PLAYING]

39:05.877 --> 39:08.346
Let's go look at the rocks.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.781
Look at what rocks?

39:09.781 --> 39:10.682
Right here.

39:10.682 --> 39:11.783
I want to go look at them.

39:11.783 --> 39:12.584
Hey, I'll be back.

39:12.584 --> 39:15.420
I got to go look at the rocks.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.354
You look gorgeous.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.288
You look nice.

39:17.288 --> 39:18.423
Thank you.
So do you.

39:18.423 --> 39:19.657
Wasn't the wedding super pretty?

39:19.657 --> 39:20.725
The wedding was nice.

39:20.725 --> 39:21.559
Really nice, right?

39:21.559 --> 39:22.660
You know what I was thinking?

39:22.660 --> 39:24.629
Like, with the wedding
and everything and I

39:24.629 --> 39:26.965
just think about all the
stuff that you do for me.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.900
I know I tell you that
how much I care for you,

39:28.900 --> 39:31.636
but I never express and
I've never said I love you.

39:31.636 --> 39:33.204
And I just want
to say I do really

39:33.204 --> 39:36.808
love you at the end of the day.

39:36.808 --> 39:40.144
You do so much for me when
I am going through things.

39:40.144 --> 39:41.779
When I'm down, you
know how to pick me up.

39:41.779 --> 39:44.716
And you're not
only my boyfriend,

39:44.716 --> 39:46.117
but you're my best friend.

39:46.117 --> 39:46.918
Whoa.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.820
Wow.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.421
If I knew you were going
to tell me you love me,

39:50.421 --> 39:52.123
I would've brought you to
the rock a long time ago.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.658
I've come to the
realization Vinnie

39:53.658 --> 39:56.060
is always there
when I'm sad, when

39:56.060 --> 39:57.295
I'm going through something.

39:57.295 --> 39:58.363
Vinnie's the best.

39:58.363 --> 40:00.231
Vinnie's the bomb dot com.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.165
I love you.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.101
I love you too, baby.

[CHEERS]

40:21.753 --> 40:24.889
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER): The
reception is just amazing.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.925
Everything about this
day keeps getting

40:26.925 --> 40:28.593
better and better and better.

40:28.593 --> 40:29.928
NIKKI BELLA: Well,
hello everyone.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.896
Thank you all for
coming to Sedona.

40:31.896 --> 40:34.232
I think you all know-- well,
at least I hope you all know--

40:34.232 --> 40:37.869
but I'm Brianna's
twin sister Nicole.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.071
Brie, we've talked about this
since we've been little girls,

40:40.071 --> 40:42.040
and I'm happy this
day is finally here.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.109
And Bryan, I am beyond happy
to call you a brother now.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.978
I love you both so much.

40:46.978 --> 40:48.513
And I love you
both so much, too.

40:48.513 --> 40:50.281
So let's raise our glasses--

40:50.281 --> 40:54.185
NIKKI BELLA: Raise our glass and
toast to Brie-- oh, to-- no--

40:54.185 --> 40:55.553
Mr. And Mrs. Danielson.

40:57.822 --> 40:59.524
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER):
Bryan and I shared the most

40:59.524 --> 41:01.326
special moment of our lives.

41:01.326 --> 41:02.827
This all couldn't
be more perfect.

41:06.397 --> 41:07.832
NIKKI BELLA (VOICEOVER):
Everyone's eating,

41:07.832 --> 41:11.102
so this is a free moment that
I could just grab John, pull

41:11.102 --> 41:12.904
him outside, and
talk to him and make

41:12.904 --> 41:15.139
sure that everything is OK.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.007
So you're having fun?

41:16.007 --> 41:16.941
Mm hmm.

41:16.941 --> 41:17.742
Good.

41:17.742 --> 41:18.876
Are you?

41:18.876 --> 41:20.712
I am.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.980
I'm sorry, though.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.882
When the focus of
most of our problems

41:24.882 --> 41:29.454
has to do with that one subject,
maybe I should know that stuff.

41:29.454 --> 41:30.722
-I know.
-Now some--

41:30.722 --> 41:31.689
That's why I feel so guilty.

41:31.689 --> 41:32.490
--how feel.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.426
Well, you're a human being.

41:35.426 --> 41:39.998
So I know you want
certain things.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.800
But I want especially to know
how you feel about it because I

41:42.800 --> 41:44.502
knew you had a bad experience.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.170
I feel bad that
I didn't tell you.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.271
I don't care.

41:47.271 --> 41:48.072
I don't.

41:48.072 --> 41:50.541
What you did before
you met me is

41:50.541 --> 41:52.210
what you did before you met me.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.278
I don't need to know
everything about you.

41:54.278 --> 41:57.315
It's just when you
can tell other people.

41:57.315 --> 42:00.985
And I would like to be on
that totem pole somewhere.

42:00.985 --> 42:02.053
I don't have to be at the top.

42:02.053 --> 42:03.154
I don't have to
be the top face--

42:03.154 --> 42:04.088
You are at the top, though.

42:04.088 --> 42:07.125
Even if I'm the
low face going--

42:07.125 --> 42:08.526
How is that?

42:08.526 --> 42:10.795
Totem pole face.

42:10.795 --> 42:12.730
I just would like to
be on the totem pole.

42:12.730 --> 42:13.998
NIKKI BELLA (VOICEOVER):
I've realized

42:13.998 --> 42:17.301
that I need to start having
confidence in my relationship

42:17.301 --> 42:20.471
with John, and that he
accepts me for all my faults.

42:20.471 --> 42:23.241
I am so relieved that
John and I have made up.

42:23.241 --> 42:27.311
And I'm just happy to be here
in Sedona with my family.

42:27.311 --> 42:28.312
Everyone's happy.

42:28.312 --> 42:30.081
Everyone's having a good time.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.116
Honestly, nothing can
go wrong right now.

42:32.116 --> 42:33.885
Everything is just perfect.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.522
I love you.

42:37.522 --> 42:39.023
I love you, too.

42:39.023 --> 42:40.291

starts the party, folks.

my wedding guests think and I
just made it about Bryan and I.

But my wedding guests are
having the time of their life,

friends and family that I do.

saying she's the luckiest girl.

No, truly.
