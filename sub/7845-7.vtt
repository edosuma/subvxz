Did they steal your chain mail again,
young Galavant?

00:20.164 --> 00:21.598
Yes.

00:21.633 --> 00:24.167
They left me here in my under armor,
father.

00:24.202 --> 00:26.303
No, no, son.

00:26.371 --> 00:28.238
A hero doesn't cry.

00:28.449 --> 00:32.109
And you are destined to be a great hero,
young Galavant.

00:32.143 --> 00:34.144
But they hurt my feelings.

00:34.178 --> 00:38.466
A hero doesn't have feelings.

00:38.486 --> 00:40.997
Talking, feelings...

00:41.017 --> 00:44.621
all that stuff and nonsense
just clouds the mind.

00:44.655 --> 00:46.423
You don't want your mind cloudy,

00:46.457 --> 00:49.157

And also...

01:32.382 --> 01:34.070
Never get married.

01:37.541 --> 01:39.323
This is it.

01:39.343 --> 01:42.245
This is my moment of glory.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.781
I'm gonna make you proud, father.

01:45.883 --> 01:47.327
I'm gonna save them.

01:47.347 --> 01:49.003
I'm gonna save all of them.

01:50.588 --> 01:51.755
Especially her.

01:51.789 --> 01:53.723
Son, don't marry her.

01:53.758 --> 01:55.419
Damn it, dad!

01:56.060 --> 01:57.566
Crazy.

02:06.246 --> 02:07.403
Hey.

02:07.438 --> 02:10.173
So, um, last night,
a lot of things were almost, kind of said.

02:10.207 --> 02:11.741
We hinted at some budding feelings,

02:11.776 --> 02:12.809
sang a song,

02:12.843 --> 02:14.477
our faces got unusually close...

02:14.512 --> 02:16.146
I'm really sorry. I can't talk.

02:16.213 --> 02:19.315
I'm in hero mode...
planning our big escape.

02:19.350 --> 02:21.584
We'll talk later.
I love the hat.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.586
- Um...
- Isabella.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.021
Ch-ch.

02:25.658 --> 02:28.758
Let "manscape" spin his wheels over there.
It doesn't matter.

02:28.792 --> 02:31.895
Your cousin Harry is coming to save us.

02:31.929 --> 02:33.429
Cousin Harry's coming?

02:33.464 --> 02:35.098
But... how?

02:35.132 --> 02:36.733
Your father sent a carrier pigeon

02:36.767 --> 02:39.168
through the skylight when
the guards weren't looking.

02:39.203 --> 02:40.570
Boom.

02:40.604 --> 02:42.238
Your cousin will save us,

02:42.273 --> 02:44.307
and then you will marry him, as planned.

02:44.341 --> 02:46.242
I don't want to marry my cousin.

02:46.276 --> 02:48.444
I mean, the age difference is so weird.

02:48.479 --> 02:50.913
Plus, he's... my cousin.

02:50.948 --> 02:52.815
Straight up, Isabella.

02:52.850 --> 02:56.714
Our family tree goes straight up...
no branches.

02:57.654 --> 02:58.688
Look at them all...

02:58.722 --> 03:00.890
Galavant planning things, looking cool.

03:00.924 --> 03:03.593
Even the old,
bald guy sent that pigeon message.

03:03.627 --> 03:05.561
That was kind of brave.

03:05.596 --> 03:06.829
What are we doing?

03:06.864 --> 03:08.998
Oh, we're just here for the jokes.

03:09.032 --> 03:10.820
Story of my life.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.368
Um...

03:12.402 --> 03:14.270
So, a little wrinkle.

03:14.304 --> 03:16.239
My cousin's coming to save us.

03:16.273 --> 03:19.978
- Thing is, he's not just my cousin.
- We don't need anyone to save us.

03:21.211 --> 03:23.222
I'm gonna save us.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.086
Prisoners...

04:04.121 --> 04:07.456
I've called you up here to catch up
my brother-in-law/ future husband.

04:08.525 --> 04:09.792
You know I can hear you, right?

04:09.826 --> 04:11.827
So, that's the king and queen of Valencia,

04:11.862 --> 04:13.596
their daughter... she annoys me...

04:13.630 --> 04:15.064
and that's my ex.

04:15.132 --> 04:17.500
I am Galavant, and so help me,
God, I will...

04:17.534 --> 04:19.834
- Shut up, pretty boy.
- My former boy toy/jester.

04:19.870 --> 04:21.403
He was cuter pre-dungeon.

04:21.438 --> 04:22.571
And...

04:22.606 --> 04:23.906
not sure who the black kid is.

04:23.940 --> 04:25.541
Wow.

04:25.575 --> 04:27.843
And, of course,
you know my current husband,

04:27.878 --> 04:29.345
your brother... Richard.

04:29.379 --> 04:32.248
I'm sorry...
you would actually go for him over me?

04:32.282 --> 04:35.718
I mean, he's really,
really, really, really old.

04:35.752 --> 04:39.588
If you're so confident
about being tougher than me,

04:39.623 --> 04:42.461
we could settle this with a duel.

04:42.481 --> 04:43.259
Oh.

04:43.293 --> 04:44.827
Oh... oh, you want to go there?

04:44.861 --> 04:46.929
- I'm there.
- Okay, fine.

04:46.963 --> 04:49.632
This is a long time coming, brother...

04:49.666 --> 04:51.667
a duel to the death!

04:52.566 --> 04:54.703
And now,
like every great king to come before us,

04:54.738 --> 04:56.739
we shall choose a champion
to fight in our stead

04:56.773 --> 04:58.040
while we watch from a safe distance

04:58.074 --> 05:00.142
while sloppily eating
oversized turkey legs.

05:00.176 --> 05:02.778
And for my champion, I choose...

05:02.812 --> 05:04.939
Gareth will fight for me.

05:05.907 --> 05:08.283
No, t-that's not fair.
I was gonna choose him.

05:08.318 --> 05:09.284
Gareth.

05:09.319 --> 05:11.020
I don't have a choice, my lord.

05:11.054 --> 05:13.689
Your move, little dicky.

05:14.858 --> 05:16.861
Well, who's going to fight for me?

05:17.460 --> 05:18.627
Anyone?

05:18.661 --> 05:20.832
Anyone here good with a sword?

05:33.343 --> 05:35.077
I'll fight for you, Richard.

05:35.111 --> 05:38.213
But when I win, you'll release my friends.

05:38.248 --> 05:40.549
- Agreed?
- Totally cool with that.

05:40.583 --> 05:41.850
Galavant fights for me!

05:41.885 --> 05:45.087
Well, that's good,
because it just so happens...

05:45.121 --> 05:49.391
♪ This is my moment in the sun ♪

05:49.425 --> 05:50.959
♪ This is my... ♪

05:52.895 --> 05:55.030
Sorry. That was annoying.

05:55.064 --> 05:56.733
So annoying.

05:57.428 --> 05:59.314
I'm hungry.

06:04.358 --> 06:05.339
Can you explain to me

06:05.359 --> 06:07.427
why you're fighting for the
man who's imprisoned us?

06:07.461 --> 06:10.028
You heard the king...
if I win, he frees us.

06:10.048 --> 06:11.498
And Galavant doesn't lose a duel.

06:11.532 --> 06:13.863
Ooh! Third-person alert.

06:14.086 --> 06:15.635
Look, I know you have a lot on your plate,

06:15.670 --> 06:17.837
but my parents can't stand you,
and my cousin is...

06:19.323 --> 06:21.353
Hello, stinkos.

06:21.373 --> 06:22.609
Stop being dumb. Call this off.

06:22.643 --> 06:24.411
Take the offer to be my shag hag.

06:24.445 --> 06:26.106
Kingsley's down with it.

06:26.126 --> 06:28.281
You know, I think I'll pass.

06:28.315 --> 06:29.680
Fine.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.293
Come along, then.

06:31.313 --> 06:32.521
You should come, too.

06:32.541 --> 06:34.725
Then I can watch you watch him die.

06:34.889 --> 06:36.489
Oh, look at that.

06:36.509 --> 06:38.792
I just made it fun for me again.

06:38.826 --> 06:40.727
Guards!

06:43.430 --> 06:47.420
Sid, if anything should happen to me,
look after them.

06:47.681 --> 06:49.769
But don't worry.
Galavant's got this.

06:51.255 --> 06:54.001
Waste of space. So cool. A... Bleep...

07:01.849 --> 07:04.484
I cannot believe this, Gareth.

07:04.518 --> 07:07.053
You've been my champion
since we were 10 years old.

07:07.087 --> 07:10.390
Now here you are,
having to fight my stupid brother.

07:10.424 --> 07:11.913
I mean, this is a disaster!

07:11.933 --> 07:14.927
If you win, I lose my crown and kingdom.

07:14.962 --> 07:17.430
- If you lose, you die.
- Yeah, I know. Sucks.

07:20.234 --> 07:21.567
I'll miss our banter.

07:21.602 --> 07:23.236
I don't like it when men touch my face.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.334
Sorry.

07:27.574 --> 07:29.542
He took my bloody seat!

07:29.576 --> 07:31.244
I left my napkin right there!

07:31.278 --> 07:34.580
Horse dog! Cat tails! Rat bits!

07:34.615 --> 07:37.397
Get your snacks before the duel, everybody!

07:38.824 --> 07:40.953
Some rat bits for the pretty little lady...

07:40.988 --> 07:42.054
on the house?

07:42.122 --> 07:44.156
No, thank you.

07:44.191 --> 07:46.425
Look, I'm sorry our date didn't work out.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.260
But please don't give up on us.

07:48.295 --> 07:49.495
Listen, chef...

07:49.529 --> 07:51.363
Ah, please... call me Vincenzo.

07:51.398 --> 07:52.698
I'd really rather not.

07:52.733 --> 07:54.967
If I named you, I could get attached.

07:55.001 --> 07:58.352
No point in getting attached if tomorrow,
we'll both be dead.

07:58.372 --> 07:59.903
Just stick with me, kid.

07:59.923 --> 08:01.807
The king and I are tight. We'll be fine.

08:01.842 --> 08:04.410
But tomorrow,
there'll likely be a new king,

08:04.444 --> 08:07.379
and he doesn't seem like a very nice guy,
does he?

08:07.414 --> 08:10.249
These royal games have been
going on for centuries, chef,

08:10.283 --> 08:14.295
and they always end badly
for the downstairs people.

08:14.990 --> 08:17.323
You go on being adorable,

08:17.357 --> 08:20.359
selling your rat bits,
pretending everything's okay.

08:20.685 --> 08:22.962
I'm gonna make my peace with God...

08:22.996 --> 08:26.088
pray for a quick death and a proper burial.

08:26.108 --> 08:28.334
You have a very bleak view of the world,
Gwynndolyn.

08:28.368 --> 08:31.347
I've had a pretty bleak life, chef.

08:39.611 --> 08:40.946
Well, I guess it's time.

08:41.948 --> 08:43.881
I know you need to stay focused,

08:43.917 --> 08:45.884
so as you head off to
your life-and-death duel,

08:45.919 --> 08:47.019
I'm not gonna mention

08:47.053 --> 08:49.330
any of the myriad of
unsaid things between us.

08:49.350 --> 08:51.266
If I'm gonna do what I have to right now,

08:51.286 --> 08:54.301
then I can't have my
mind or my heart clouded.

08:54.827 --> 08:57.192
But trust me, princess...

08:57.764 --> 09:00.232
my mind and my heart would be clouded

09:00.266 --> 09:02.252
if I allowed such things.

09:03.196 --> 09:04.747
Well...

09:04.767 --> 09:06.459
break a leg.

09:06.782 --> 09:09.675
For you, princess,
I might break both of his.

few things to talk about.

- Me too.

10:19.221 --> 10:20.890
Prince Harry is my cousin.

10:20.910 --> 10:22.328

10:24.098 --> 10:24.756
Horrible.

10:24.776 --> 10:26.494
How could you not tell me you were engaged?

10:26.514 --> 10:27.512
Because it's ridiculous.

10:27.532 --> 10:30.180
I mean, when he's 30,
I'll be in my early 40s.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.451
That's not that ridiculous.

10:32.955 --> 10:34.759
No. I guess not.

10:34.995 --> 10:36.712

is the appropriate time

10:38.126 --> 10:39.126
to tell me all this?

10:39.161 --> 10:40.895
I'm just about to fight for our lives.

10:40.929 --> 10:43.164
I was trying to tell you this morning,
but you didn't want to talk.

10:43.198 --> 10:44.632
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
It's out there.

10:44.666 --> 10:45.866
It's rattling around in my head,

10:45.901 --> 10:47.747
taking up space where
fight thoughts should be.

10:47.767 --> 10:49.837
This whole thing's gotten
completely out of control.

10:49.871 --> 10:52.073
- I've got to do something.
- You think?

10:52.107 --> 10:53.331
Watch this.

10:53.351 --> 10:54.909
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:54.943 --> 10:57.278
as eager as I am to begin this duel...

10:57.312 --> 10:59.613
and golly, am I eager...

10:59.648 --> 11:01.716
protocol dictates the
arrival of a fellow royal

11:01.750 --> 11:03.784
necessitates a pre-duel welcome feast.

11:03.819 --> 11:04.785
What?

11:04.820 --> 11:06.454
All right, everybody! Let's to the feast!

11:07.723 --> 11:09.291
You're joking.

11:09.311 --> 11:10.157
You're serious.

11:10.192 --> 11:12.587
Where is everybody going?!

11:12.798 --> 11:14.228
Come on!

11:15.964 --> 11:18.099
You hear that?
They're cheering.

11:18.133 --> 11:21.035
That must mean Galavant is dead.

11:21.069 --> 11:23.035
Good night, sweet prince.

11:23.055 --> 11:24.738
I'm sorry for your loss.

11:24.773 --> 11:26.640
We'll mourn later.

11:26.675 --> 11:29.810
Galavant always taught me a
hero represses his feelings,

11:29.845 --> 11:32.431
which is what I'm doing right now.

11:40.856 --> 11:42.305
So, ideas?

11:43.158 --> 11:44.692
Call that guard over.

11:44.726 --> 11:45.960
Which one?

11:45.994 --> 11:48.462
- Ivan the mutilator or Keith?
- Keith.

11:48.496 --> 11:49.430
H-hey, Keith?

11:49.464 --> 11:51.665
Can you come here a sec?

11:51.700 --> 11:54.345
Hey, Keith, check this out.

11:55.737 --> 11:57.738
Ah. Aha?

12:01.576 --> 12:02.876
Mm?

12:03.114 --> 12:04.417
Mm?

12:04.702 --> 12:06.146
Hm?

12:06.181 --> 12:07.815
Ahhhh!

12:11.295 --> 12:12.886
What was that?

12:14.001 --> 12:15.502
First thing they teach
you in jester school...

12:15.522 --> 12:17.091
classic misdirection.

12:17.125 --> 12:19.610
Should have done this
before they killed Galavant.

12:20.702 --> 12:22.463
Now,
if we could just get rid of the guards...

12:22.497 --> 12:25.283
Hey, guys! Pre-duel lunch! Come on!

12:28.703 --> 12:30.270
This isn't luck.

12:30.305 --> 12:32.873
Galavant must be helping
us from beyond the grave.

12:32.907 --> 12:34.675
Follow me.

12:34.709 --> 12:36.543
This ends badly.

12:37.612 --> 12:39.746
Oh, good. You're here.

12:39.781 --> 12:41.281
Where else would I be?

12:41.316 --> 12:43.984
I'm preparing an impromptu
feast for 75 uppity royals,

12:44.018 --> 12:45.519
because... Bleep... me, right?

12:45.553 --> 12:47.721
I don't want to have a bleak life anymore.

12:47.755 --> 12:50.557
Look, there are three factions
of warring royals here

12:50.592 --> 12:53.560
for a feast that you're cooking,
that I'm serving.

12:53.595 --> 12:55.093
This ends with us dead...

12:55.113 --> 12:57.064
maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow,

12:57.098 --> 12:58.865
but it always ends the same way.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.231
Do you know,
I'm beginning to think you're right.

13:01.636 --> 13:05.305
Why can't we change the ending?

14:57.886 --> 14:59.235
Hello, Galavant.

14:59.255 --> 15:00.830
Last meal.

15:00.850 --> 15:03.680
Anything else you'd like
to do for the last time?

15:04.393 --> 15:05.526
No.

15:05.561 --> 15:06.794
Oh.

15:06.828 --> 15:09.297
You're doing your
strong-and-silent-hero thing.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.411
What?

15:11.431 --> 15:14.435
That thing your dumb dad
drilled into your head.

15:14.469 --> 15:16.404
"Son, a hero doesn't talk.

15:16.438 --> 15:19.040
"He might not hear it
when his moment arrives.

15:19.074 --> 15:21.308
Blah, blah, blah, have another drink."

15:23.835 --> 15:25.980
Oh, my God.

15:26.014 --> 15:28.543
That is exactly what I'm doing.

15:29.561 --> 15:31.886
You know, sometimes,
I see this glimmer in you.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.921
- You know, you're...
- if you eat that last danish,

15:33.955 --> 15:38.065
I will reach down your throat, pull it out,
and beat you to death with it!

15:39.895 --> 15:41.562
Never mind.

15:41.596 --> 15:43.864
Up here, we want to go left.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.500
Really?
'Cause Galavant's map says we go right.

15:46.535 --> 15:49.036
Well,
my husband and I have lived here 40 years,

15:49.070 --> 15:50.404
but really... tell me more

15:50.438 --> 15:52.306
about your dead friend's hand-drawn map!

15:52.340 --> 15:53.607
Apologies for my wife.

15:53.675 --> 15:56.343
We've been in that dungeon
a really long time.

15:56.378 --> 15:58.512
Everybody, shh! A guard.

16:01.834 --> 16:04.058
You know what? We'll go your way.

16:04.078 --> 16:05.686
All right, Gareth, I bought us some time.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.155
What's next? What do you think?

16:08.189 --> 16:09.323
You know what I think?

16:09.357 --> 16:11.492
I think you should start acting like a man

16:11.526 --> 16:12.593
and not like a king.

16:12.627 --> 16:13.994
I think you should have fought

16:14.028 --> 16:16.730
that old geezer of a brother of yours,
kicked his ass,

16:16.765 --> 16:19.600
and we wouldn't be in this
position we are right now.

16:19.634 --> 16:22.436
And how does he get this hummus so creamy?

16:22.470 --> 16:25.005
I mean, when I do it myself,
I can't get it this creamy.

16:25.039 --> 16:27.174
And the chickpeas so perfectly blended.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.675
It's yummy.

16:30.178 --> 16:31.445
Bless you.

16:31.479 --> 16:33.180
Thank you.

16:34.549 --> 16:35.282
Bless you.

16:35.316 --> 16:36.583
Enough!

16:39.754 --> 16:42.489
Well, hurry!
Bless me before my soul escapes!

16:47.161 --> 16:49.663
What the hell is going on?

16:50.519 --> 16:53.633
It's starting! The poison's working!

16:53.668 --> 16:55.569
Die, swine!

16:55.603 --> 16:57.204
Rot in hell!

16:57.238 --> 16:59.159
How long till they die?

16:59.741 --> 17:01.460
I couldn't do it.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.639
What?

17:02.659 --> 17:04.978
I know what you said, but I'm not a killer.

17:05.012 --> 17:06.680
So what's happening?

17:06.714 --> 17:08.815
I've been feeding these
royals my whole life.

17:08.849 --> 17:11.384
I know every single thing
they're allergic to.

17:11.419 --> 17:13.319
They won't die, but at the very least,

17:13.354 --> 17:15.489
we'll get to see them in
a great deal of discomfort

17:15.522 --> 17:16.857
before they kill us.

17:16.891 --> 17:19.829
Well, you've let me down terribly.

17:21.517 --> 17:22.996
But it was nice to be reminded

17:23.030 --> 17:26.332
there still are good-hearted
people in the world.

17:26.934 --> 17:28.902
If this is my last day on earth,

17:28.936 --> 17:32.005
at least it wasn't a bleak one.

17:32.039 --> 17:35.284
I thank you for that, Vincenzo.

17:45.620 --> 17:48.054
You have a family of spiders in your hair.

17:48.089 --> 17:50.223
Your breath reminds me of the time

17:50.257 --> 17:53.350
I found my Uncle's body in a well.

17:56.688 --> 17:57.831
The king is scratching.

18:05.106 --> 18:08.541
We may need
to clear the throne room.

18:15.115 --> 18:16.479
He's alive.

18:16.499 --> 18:18.125
Galavant!

18:23.524 --> 18:25.558
This is your moment,
Galavant.

18:25.593 --> 18:28.228
Kill the kings. Be the hero.

18:45.740 --> 18:48.381
- What are you doing?
- You're allergic to crab.

18:48.693 --> 18:50.650
If you eat that,
your throat's gonna get all itchy,

18:50.684 --> 18:53.186
and you're gonna be making
that... sound all night.

18:54.671 --> 18:57.219
I'm sorry we didn't speak earlier.

18:57.239 --> 19:00.086
Speaking to you is one of
my favorite things to do.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.461
Perhaps my favorite conversation ever

19:01.495 --> 19:03.796
was our four-hour analysis of what sid's
"thank you" meant.

19:03.831 --> 19:05.698
I meant "thank you."

19:05.733 --> 19:07.600
- Sid!
- So passive-aggressive.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.135
My father was wrong.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.320
You don't have to hide
your feelings to be a hero.

19:12.340 --> 19:14.207
If I did, I wouldn't be your type of hero.

19:14.871 --> 19:18.317
And frankly, princess,
that's the only type of hero I want to be.

19:19.012 --> 19:21.280
Well, sucks for me.

19:21.315 --> 19:23.616
I better go home, or my mom's gonna be mad.

19:23.650 --> 19:26.748
Have fun changing your
name when you get married.

19:27.154 --> 19:28.120
Freak.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.522
Guards!

19:29.556 --> 19:31.023
Bye, Harry.

19:31.277 --> 19:32.859
Well, would you look at that?

19:32.926 --> 19:36.729
You didn't have to kill a soul,
but you finally got your moment.

19:36.912 --> 19:38.579
No.

19:38.985 --> 19:40.233
Not quite yet.

19:42.002 --> 19:49.871
♪ This is my moment in the sun ♪

19:49.891 --> 19:55.781
♪ This is my mome-e-e-e-nt ♪

20:00.928 --> 20:02.488
That's it?

20:02.703 --> 20:03.823
Yeah, that's all I got.

20:03.857 --> 20:07.909
Well, I say let's execute the chef.

20:07.929 --> 20:09.559
Excuse me!

20:09.579 --> 20:12.431
He is my chef, and only I can execute him.

20:12.466 --> 20:15.441
Then do something about it, little dicky.

20:16.369 --> 20:18.437
Maybe I will!

20:18.472 --> 20:22.942
I hereby declare that I shall
be the first royal in history

20:22.976 --> 20:25.111
to fight his own duel!

20:26.627 --> 20:28.447
Very impressive.

20:28.482 --> 20:32.051
I'm looking forward to the
day that Gareth will kill you.

20:32.085 --> 20:33.452
Gareth?

20:33.487 --> 20:35.254
No, no, no, no.
I thought you and I were going to fight.

20:35.288 --> 20:36.255
No.

20:36.289 --> 20:37.490
It'll be fun

20:37.524 --> 20:39.692
watching your best friend kill you, Dickie.

20:41.561 --> 20:44.029
Oh, I am so turned on right...

20:44.064 --> 20:45.764
Aah!

20:46.617 --> 20:47.600
'Scu...

20:48.969 --> 20:50.869
'Scuse me.

20:52.239 --> 20:54.373
Who knows, sire? Maybe you'll win.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.042
Only one thing is certain.

20:57.077 --> 20:58.842
I'm a dead man?
