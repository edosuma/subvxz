Olive and I are giving each
other makeovers today!

00:07.254 --> 00:08.888
I barely get to spend
any time alone with her

00:08.889 --> 00:10.623

00:10.624 --> 00:12.491
He is always around.

It'll be nice to finally do
something, just me and Olive.

00:16.513 --> 00:18.497
Clearly you've been desperate
for companionship,

00:18.532 --> 00:19.682

Sure. Just one problem.

00:30.610 --> 00:31.811

00:33.647 --> 00:35.781
He's pretty, but he's not a girl.

00:37.734 --> 00:40.536
The spy business
is a very lonely business,

00:40.570 --> 00:42.655

00:43.740 --> 00:45.374
Come on, you can do my makeup,

00:45.408 --> 00:47.359

Don't worry, Chyna.

in makeup application.

Thanks, Chyna. I look great.

DIXON: And Olive, I like the
way you put makeup on me.

01:07.597 --> 01:08.757
And Chyna, what do you think?

01:11.818 --> 01:15.771
I think you could have told me you
specialize in disguise makeup.

01:18.742 --> 01:22.411
And why would a spy ever need
to look like a hamburger?

12:12.608 --> 12:14.309
OKSANA:
(SCREAMING) You!

12:14.343 --> 12:15.527
Get away from him!

12:19.348 --> 12:22.400
Oksana? You try to
steal Dixie Cup!

12:23.319 --> 12:24.619
No, not at all.

12:24.653 --> 12:25.693
I was talking about Olive.

12:26.372 --> 12:27.355
Dixon, tell her.

12:28.374 --> 12:29.657
Dixon?
Where are you?

12:30.409 --> 12:31.492
Are you in disguise makeup?

12:31.794 --> 12:34.329
Are you the cantaloupe?
Tell her, cantaloupe!

12:35.414 --> 12:37.632
You now become my blood enemy!

12:38.551 --> 12:41.336
(NERVOUS CHUCKLING) Don't you
think we're moving too fast?

12:41.370 --> 12:43.537
Maybe we should start
as regular enemies,

12:43.556 --> 12:46.424
and see how that goes before we
jump ahead to blood enemies.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.677
I would even be willing
to try blood frenemies.

12:51.347 --> 12:53.481
This is what I do to blood frenemies.

12:54.433 --> 12:55.400
(YELLING) Ya!

12:58.687 --> 13:00.271
(STAMMERING) You've
got to listen to me.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.407
I'm not interested in Dixon!

13:02.441 --> 13:03.408
(YELLING) Liar!

13:03.742 --> 13:05.610
All girlies want Dixie Cup!

13:06.579 --> 13:08.329
That is so not true!

13:08.497 --> 13:10.582
I want Dixie Cup!

13:13.402 --> 13:16.588
Okay, that is what we call in
America "a hilarious coincidence."

13:17.706 --> 13:21.742
I have ways of truthing
the truth out of peoples!

13:22.678 --> 13:24.679
You know the best way
to get the truth out of me?

13:25.464 --> 13:27.382
Close your eyes and count to 100.

13:27.633 --> 13:30.602
I only learn to count
to 20 in English.

13:31.303 --> 13:32.463
Oh, that's okay.
That'll work.

13:33.389 --> 13:34.606
One. Seven.

13:34.756 --> 13:37.442
Four. Ten. W.

13:37.759 --> 13:39.527
Six. Yellow.

13:55.147 --> 13:58.799
Lexi, we need to talk
about this "arrangement."

13:58.984 --> 14:00.134
Um, I can explain.

14:00.152 --> 14:02.937
After all these years of
going to school together,

14:02.971 --> 14:05.773
I never thought you were capable
of something like this.

14:05.974 --> 14:06.974
Really?

14:06.992 --> 14:09.076
Because I feel like
I've done way worse.

14:10.862 --> 14:13.748
Moving all your stuff out of your
closet and putting it in here.

14:14.683 --> 14:16.323
That must have been
a huge hassle for you.

14:17.002 --> 14:17.985
Thanks.

14:20.038 --> 14:22.857
Oh, right, the hiding spot.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.759
You're welcome.

14:24.793 --> 14:26.994
Now back in the hole, fugitives!

14:30.015 --> 14:31.849
Uh, there's one problem.

14:31.883 --> 14:33.684
I can't spend that much time

14:33.718 --> 14:35.052
in a confined space with Fletcher.

14:35.887 --> 14:38.806
All he does is complain
about my flatulence!

14:40.892 --> 14:42.810
Hey, I don't always complain!

14:43.678 --> 14:45.946
Sometimes I'm just unconscious.

14:48.700 --> 14:49.950
It is way too dangerous

14:49.985 --> 14:51.652
for you guys to be in here!

14:51.853 --> 14:53.037
The cops were all over this place

14:53.071 --> 14:54.789
right before you walked in.

14:54.956 --> 14:56.707
They boxed up all your stuff and

14:56.992 --> 14:58.042
took it away as evidence.

14:59.127 --> 15:01.579
Oh, no! We've got
to get out of here!

15:01.830 --> 15:03.030
Good idea. See you.

15:04.716 --> 15:05.699
Wait!

15:05.884 --> 15:07.034
We'll never escape on foot.

15:07.869 --> 15:09.753
Why don't we take the
driverless car Lexi read about

15:09.805 --> 15:11.126
in that completely real newspaper?

15:11.890 --> 15:13.757
No! You can't do that!

15:13.892 --> 15:15.059
Sure we can!

15:15.093 --> 15:17.678
All we have to do is use
your Z-Pad to drive it here

15:17.712 --> 15:19.763
and it'll be waiting just
outside the door. Right?

15:20.098 --> 15:21.065
I guess so.

15:24.936 --> 15:25.903
Ugh!

15:26.054 --> 15:27.888
Tricking people out of their rooms

15:27.906 --> 15:30.658
so you can turn it
into a walk-in closet

15:30.692 --> 15:32.076
should not be this difficult!

15:35.914 --> 15:36.897

(SCREAMING)

15:41.837 --> 15:42.786
(SCREAMING)

15:43.788 --> 15:44.839
What's wrong?

15:46.007 --> 15:48.248
I was just wondering if you
got my Dixie Cup back for me.

15:48.793 --> 15:51.095
Maybe it's time to
forget about Dixie Cup

15:51.129 --> 15:53.747
and just be Solo Cup for a while.

15:55.750 --> 15:56.967
You deserve someone who won't run off

15:57.018 --> 15:59.019
with the first homicidal
maniac he sees.

15:59.804 --> 16:01.884
Speaking of which, you haven't
seen Oksana, have you?

16:03.642 --> 16:05.609
Well, I appreciate you trying
to make me feel better,

16:05.644 --> 16:08.044
but there's no way you can
understand what I'm going through.

16:08.930 --> 16:10.064
Nobody would ever break up with you,

16:10.098 --> 16:11.815
because everybody loves you.

16:12.734 --> 16:14.768
You can't understand
how it feels to be afraid

16:14.786 --> 16:16.787
of having no one and ending up alone.

16:18.740 --> 16:21.775
Olive, you never have to
worry about being alone,

16:22.911 --> 16:24.628
because I'll always be here for you.

16:24.663 --> 16:27.631
OKSANA: Where you go,
Dixie Cup thief?

16:27.799 --> 16:28.799
Except now! Gotta run!

16:36.841 --> 16:39.927
Okay, the driverless car
should be here any second.

16:40.762 --> 16:41.729
(TIRES SCREECHING)

16:41.980 --> 16:43.097
Is this the driverless car?

16:43.965 --> 16:46.800
You mean the car that just
pulled up with no driver?

16:55.994 --> 16:57.077
Wow!

16:57.112 --> 16:59.663
You'd think Lexi's closet
would have more clothes.

16:59.864 --> 17:02.950
And less of a stale flatulence smell.

17:05.787 --> 17:07.871
Aha! There you is, Chyna!

17:08.089 --> 17:10.007
Now admit you want Dixie Cup!

17:11.710 --> 17:13.993
Okay, the truth is...

17:15.931 --> 17:16.880
I'm not Chyna.

17:17.799 --> 17:21.835
My real name Dorianna Bannisterovich.

17:23.805 --> 17:26.607
You Dorianna Bannisterovich?

17:26.974 --> 17:29.059
Head of Russian Secret Agency?

17:30.061 --> 17:32.012
There's really a
Dorianna Bannisterovich?

17:33.114 --> 17:35.682
I mean <i>da, da.</i>

17:36.017 --> 17:37.651
Don't worry about Chyna.

17:37.685 --> 17:38.786
Agency took care of her.

17:38.954 --> 17:41.071
She tried to escape
in elaborate makeup.

17:41.906 --> 17:43.707
This all that's left of her now.

This...

17:57.722 --> 17:58.872
Delicious!

18:00.809 --> 18:02.709
All American food taste this good?

18:03.812 --> 18:04.878
Yes.

18:06.264 --> 18:09.683
So maybe you should forget the
whole spying and vengeance thing

18:09.717 --> 18:10.818
and just stay in America.

18:11.052 --> 18:13.887
Because revenge, like
everything in America,

18:14.606 --> 18:15.739
is a dish best served

18:16.908 --> 18:17.941
with a side of fries.

store or a cute guy.

to drive us to Canada!

Beep-beep.

18:56.064 --> 18:57.981
Take us to Canada, talking car!

18:58.983 --> 19:01.618
No. Why should I
listen to someone

19:01.653 --> 19:03.821
someone who's been stinking
up the back seat for miles?

19:04.906 --> 19:06.657
You have more gas than I do.

What's going on?

19:19.921 --> 19:22.589
Okay. You were
playing a game.

19:22.841 --> 19:24.641
You didn't cause any damage.

19:24.843 --> 19:26.977
I tricked you so I could
use your room as a closet.

19:28.646 --> 19:29.680
So you lied to us?

19:30.932 --> 19:33.600
You're no better than this talking
car that also lied to us!

19:34.936 --> 19:35.986
Never mind that!

19:36.654 --> 19:38.605
I destroyed a bookstore!

19:38.973 --> 19:40.807
Luckily, no one got hurt,

19:40.825 --> 19:41.985
because no one reads anymore.

19:43.811 --> 19:46.092
Yeah, but you're going to have
to pay for all this damage.

19:46.647 --> 19:47.814
I can't afford that!

19:48.649 --> 19:49.616
Then you'd better hide.

19:50.085 --> 19:51.952

be safe in my closet?

up here to talk to me?

20:15.860 --> 20:17.644
No, I haven't seen Chyna.

20:17.812 --> 20:19.696

in a fake talking car.

20:21.682 --> 20:22.983
Oh. That's nice.

What? You're not going
to make fun of me

20:26.738 --> 20:28.906

I was dumped recently, too.

20:42.921 --> 20:43.921

20:44.923 --> 20:46.443
You're going to go
through some phases.

20:46.891 --> 20:48.452

like a total loser.

20:48.810 --> 20:49.843

20:51.062 --> 20:53.263

in this phase for a while.

you kissed me! And...

I don't feel like vomiting.

Me neither.
What is happening?

21:38.142 --> 21:39.810
I sent Dixon away.

21:39.861 --> 21:41.222
It's my fault he broke up with you.

21:42.063 --> 21:43.981
I feel terrible.
Can you ever forgive me?

21:44.765 --> 21:46.867
Yeah, of course. 'Cause
that's what friends do.

21:46.901 --> 21:48.035
They kiss and make up.
And...

21:48.703 --> 21:50.037
And by that I mean they reconcile

21:50.071 --> 21:51.822
because why would you
literally kiss me?

21:51.873 --> 21:53.790
Or anyone kiss me?

I'm over Dixon.

22:02.950 --> 22:04.284
You are?
Mmm-hmm.

22:04.302 --> 22:07.023
(CHUCKLING) Because you were, like,
head over heels in love with him.

22:07.055 --> 22:09.890
I mean, he is really
handsome, and debonair,

22:09.924 --> 22:12.009
and handsome, and handsome...

22:12.060 --> 22:13.844
The lady said she's over him!

22:15.813 --> 22:17.848
Okay. Fine. Sorry.

22:22.654 --> 22:23.854
So...

22:25.857 --> 22:26.823
What now?

22:28.243 --> 22:31.662
Well, we could either talk endlessly
about the kiss and what it means,

22:31.696 --> 22:33.813
or we could just pretend
it never happened.

22:34.815 --> 22:35.866
Or we could kiss again.

22:36.701 --> 22:37.668
Okay.

22:40.755 --> 22:41.788
Get out of here, Philip!

Tell you what,

23:10.702 --> 23:13.154
I'm sure I could find another
girl to go out with you.

23:13.538 --> 23:15.289
Of course, it won't be easy.

out with Dixon?
