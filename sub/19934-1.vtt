00:13.681 --> 00:15.441
Technology.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.519
It's all around us.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.424
Helping. Enriching.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.759
Entertaining.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.096
Protecting.

00:37.138 --> 00:40.506
For the last ten years,
Titan has brought you closer

00:40.508 --> 00:42.041
faster...

00:46.380 --> 00:48.647
making life easier...

00:48.649 --> 00:50.315
smarter...

00:55.689 --> 00:58.657
unique, fearless

00:58.659 --> 01:00.259
bold.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.829
These are
words you've come to associate

01:03.831 --> 01:08.567
and expect from Titan
and its CEO, Linus Springer.

01:14.175 --> 01:17.476
Titan International Technology
and Networking.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.348
Feel good?
Remember, don't be nervous.

01:31.225 --> 01:35.094
This is where it all started.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.663
When I first met Natalie,
there was a fish market

01:37.665 --> 01:39.231
on the first floor
of this building.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.301
Remember the smell?
God, it was terrible.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.304
We named all the search
algorithms after body parts.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.439
Guts, heads, gills.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.174
I think we used
so many iterations

01:49.176 --> 01:52.478
we ran out of names nearly.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.481
But of course you cracked it.
Oh, yes, you did.

01:56.851 --> 02:00.519
The code that changed
Internet search forever

02:00.521 --> 02:03.322
and the algorithm
that launched Titan.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.126
Every day for 15 years

02:07.128 --> 02:11.196
we've remained consistently
at 100% uptime.

02:11.198 --> 02:14.766
And now, the search tool
you created is the foundation

02:14.768 --> 02:16.468
for everything that Titan is.

02:16.470 --> 02:20.139
Email, books, news,
health care, social media.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.141
We're in your desktops,
we're in your pockets

02:22.143 --> 02:24.343
and soon, we're pretty much
gonna be everywhere.

02:25.579 --> 02:29.648
So... Natalie...

02:29.650 --> 02:33.352
I would very much
be deeply grateful...

02:33.354 --> 02:34.920
if you would be
the very first person

02:34.922 --> 02:37.623
to share with the users
of the world

02:37.625 --> 02:41.326
Titan's new product.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.765
Ahem.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.704
Hello, Andi.

02:52.706 --> 02:56.308
Hello, Natalie.
Nice to meet you all.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.277
I'm Andi-di-di.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.680
Nice to meet you.
I'm Andi. Nice to meet you.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.916
There's 200 million
users logged into it right now.

03:03.918 --> 03:05.717
Fix the bug.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.286
Seems that Andi's
been programmed

03:07.288 --> 03:08.754
with a repetitive cordiality

03:08.756 --> 03:10.956
and civility cycle
just for this day. Well, uh...

03:10.958 --> 03:13.725
We'll take a short break
and be right back with you.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.294
Fix it.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.981
What are you doing?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.284
Linus needs you.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.722
Are you going to finish that?

03:43.724 --> 03:46.391
Do you think it's a good idea
to drink right now?

03:49.897 --> 03:52.931
Linus says you have until Friday
to get Andi online.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.568
He expects a flawless rollout.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.538
It can't be done by Friday.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.910
Linus didn't offer
an alternative.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.916
Tell him I'll be right down.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.494
Mmm.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.662
Did you hear that?

05:40.341 --> 05:43.342
Yeah, so I fixed the
lighting in this whole section here

05:43.344 --> 05:46.345
tuning up the textures,
rendered a little bit.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.579
I took the sex scene
out of here.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.847
Come on.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.718
Yup.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.820
Can your video card
think you can handle this?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.558
Fixed the, uh,
oh, wait, check this out.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.561
See ya.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.965
Ah! You walked into my trap.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.633
The game's no fun
if you always win.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.502
Why would I make
a game where I lose?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.738
You died in that
explosion too, remember?

06:12.740 --> 06:15.540
Technically, the blast
hit you out first, so I win.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.709
You're so dead next time.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.113
It's open.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.682
You really need a decorator.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.118
What I really need
is a new soldering iron

06:26.120 --> 06:28.019
and video card.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.455
- How's Mateo?
- He killed me.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.992
Yeah, another good reason
not to hang out with that kid.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.763
Don't worry, Officer Mom,
we are still broken up.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.965
I just need someone
to bounce ideas off of.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.033
I can trust his coding skills,
even if I can't trust him.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.169
He's still totally on probation.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.637
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

06:45.639 --> 06:48.039
I've tested and retested my app.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.575
I am feeling good about it.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.911
I don't mean that, I mean

06:52.913 --> 06:54.846
do you really want
to go to Titan?

06:56.183 --> 06:58.263
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

07:00.487 --> 07:04.055
Alright, no more "Get out
of jail free" cards, Jess.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.126
No more trouble, I promise.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.662
You're not the one
that got in trouble.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.836
Listen, Titan likes my app.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.172
I want their money.
It's that's simple.

07:20.174 --> 07:22.607
So you do have something
in common with your father.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.210
Take that back.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.547
Okay. So, should we go?

07:28.549 --> 07:30.816
Actually, they're sending a car.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.452
Titan is sending you a car?

07:33.454 --> 07:35.921
Relax. It's an Andi.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.924
It drives itself.
You can come see it if you want.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.792
Didn't that fail
in it's first launch?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.661
That was three
months ago, beta-tested.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.895
It's gonna be huge.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.732
It's better than I thought.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.568
Huh.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.777
Should I sit in the front
or the back?

07:58.779 --> 08:00.912
W-wait, wait, wait, wait,
this car drives itself?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.781
How is this remotely safe?

08:02.783 --> 08:05.817
They've logged over a million
miles with one accident.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.220
And that
was the other guy's fault.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.622
Yeah, it's always
the other guy's fault, right?

08:10.624 --> 08:12.824
Hello, Jessie. I'm Andi.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.260
Please let me know
if I can help you in any way.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.963
- This is cool.
- Who's Andi?

08:17.965 --> 08:21.533
Titan's voice-activated
plain language interface.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.135
Alright, well, make sure you
take care of my daughter, Andi.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.138
Don't worry, Emily.
Jessie will be safe with me.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.175
See that? You and Andi are on
the same page. I love you, mom.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.144
I love you, too.

08:35.616 --> 08:39.217
Alright, Andi,
let's go to Titan.

08:39.219 --> 08:43.522
Heading to
Titan, original campus.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.440
Jessie!

09:41.982 --> 09:43.148
Andi?

09:45.986 --> 09:48.219
Actually, Barclay.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.789
And Andi.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.791
I'm Titan's
senior vice president

09:52.793 --> 09:54.960
of business development.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.995
As well as the voice.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.631
Sounds like Springer's
got you doing double duty.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.833
Linus prefers a lean operation.

10:01.835 --> 10:05.203
Seems like things are about as
lean as they can be around here.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.739
We are upgrading
some design and tech elements

10:07.741 --> 10:10.141
before the building
is fully staffed.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.944
But where better for the world's
brightest young minds

10:12.946 --> 10:14.879
than the new
Andi-powered office?

10:14.881 --> 10:16.748
Yeah,
saw the rollout presentation

10:16.750 --> 10:20.118
a couple months ago, you guys
finally get Andi up and running?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.820
She got you here, didn't she?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.157
This will connect you to Andi.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.760
She'll be your ID,
your keys, your calendar

10:28.762 --> 10:31.229
and your communications hub.

10:31.231 --> 10:35.100
But first, I just need you
to click accept.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.004
What am I accepting?

10:39.006 --> 10:42.173
Nondisclosure, liability waiver,
it's standard.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.775
And if I don't accept?

10:43.777 --> 10:45.310
Then Linus has directed me
to wish you

10:45.312 --> 10:47.846
the best of luck
in your future endeavors.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.750
"Just click and accept"

10:51.752 --> 10:53.752
the famous last words
of the Internet.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.358
Welcome to Titan International
Technology And Networking.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.928
Welcome to Titan International
Technology And Communications.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.953
Andi, where to now?

11:28.955 --> 11:32.757
Please select your floor.
Level one, entrance and lobby.

11:32.759 --> 11:35.727
Level two, meeting rooms
and shared workspace.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.430
Level three,
micro dorms and sleeping pods.

11:38.432 --> 11:42.801
Level five, executive offices
and roof access.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.969
Andi, what's on Level four?

11:44.971 --> 11:48.740
Unfortunately, you do
not have access at this time.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.782
Alright,
then I'll just go to the dorms.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.080
Alright. Let's just do this.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.328
Welcome home, Jessie.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.130
Thanks, Andi.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.313
I thought you left me for dead
in an explosion.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.783
Nice digs.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.953
How sweet
was that car ride? Hmm?

13:13.426 --> 13:15.493
Say billionaire!

13:19.366 --> 13:21.065
Hey, don't worry about it.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.836
In tech...
nobody cares about your past.

13:24.838 --> 13:25.904
It's all about your future.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.138
I'm not worried.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.020
I'm just here
to win and go home.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.243
I'm not leaving,
I hate to break it to you

13:32.245 --> 13:36.147
but, uh, if you wanna win,
you're gonna have to beat me.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.484
That's just not gonna happen.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.420
Welcome session in
five minutes on Level three.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.222
- You heard that, too?
- Yeah.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.860
I guess we gotta do
what the robot says.

13:48.862 --> 13:52.263
- After you.
- No, after you.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.598
- You sure?
- Just-just...

13:53.600 --> 13:55.160
- Just go.
- Okay.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.481
You're really uptight.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.017
You're not gonna crack, are you?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.285
I'm doing fine.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.223
Some people just can't hack it.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.259
This is the building
that lady killed herself off of.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.596
Password, L8RG8R.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.432
Later gator!

14:27.434 --> 14:29.367
Is this your way
of reassuring me?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.369
I was making conversation,
look, it'd be a lot easier

14:31.371 --> 14:32.971
if we didn't dance around
the real issue.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.172
I like dancing.

14:36.142 --> 14:39.177
You know, you can't punish me
forever. Andi, Level two.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.879
Maybe not forever
but this is not the week to

14:40.881 --> 14:43.281
figure out what we are, okay?
I need to focus.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.251
Oh, my God. Y-you froze me out
for nine months, alright?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.952
And I think
this is the perfect time

14:47.954 --> 14:49.487
you know, cooped up
in the original Titan building

14:49.489 --> 14:52.190
where Springer started it all.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.625
We could be a power couple
right off the bat.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.460
What if we're more
power friends?

14:55.462 --> 14:57.128
- Do I have another choice?
- Not really.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.430
- Not yet.
- You're relentless.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.352
Hey, it's what
makes me charming.

15:04.471 --> 15:08.973
Jessie and Mateo,
thanks for joining us.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.509
And just so you're aware,
Mr. Springer expects everyone

15:11.511 --> 15:14.312
to be five minutes early
to meetings.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.274
You told us about the
meeting five minutes ago.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.351
Thank you, Barclay.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.513
Do be a sweetheart,
get me a cup of green tea.

15:23.657 --> 15:28.126
Okay. Innovation. Disruption.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.094
Revolution. Genesis.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.298
Before man landed on the moon

15:33.300 --> 15:35.033
there were at least a dozen
or so who died trying.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.702
Why? 'Cause change is painful.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.104
And pain is changeful.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.273
And it requires sacrifice.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.108
And that's what I'm looking for

15:44.110 --> 15:46.577
in this
Young Innovators' Boot Camp.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.246
The next generation,
the next wave

15:48.248 --> 15:49.981
of young men and young women

15:49.983 --> 15:52.650
who will challenge themselves

15:52.652 --> 15:55.653
who will drag us into the future

15:55.655 --> 15:57.695
no matter what or who
gets in their way.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.193
Ian. Where's Ian? Ian. Yes.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.696
Your 3D printer was magnificent.

16:04.698 --> 16:07.999
Why don't you share with us
wha-what made it so special?

16:08.001 --> 16:10.168
Uh, my model is
inexpensive and scalable...

16:10.170 --> 16:11.703
Yeah, I know how how you do it,
but I, uh...

16:11.705 --> 16:14.272
I wanna know
what makes it special.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.407
Wow me. Wow us.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.411
My printer prints
other 3D printers.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.147
Now we're talking here!
Now we're cooking on gas!

16:23.149 --> 16:25.383
Who's next?
Who wants to get up here?

16:25.385 --> 16:28.219
Alright, come on. Come on!

16:31.758 --> 16:33.678
I have to deal
with severe asthma.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.196
I hate being weak

16:38.198 --> 16:41.332
so I started hacking
my own body.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.202
My forearm unit tracks
my heart rate, respiration

16:44.204 --> 16:46.304
blood chemistry, everything.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.774
I get instant feedback
from my eyepiece

16:49.776 --> 16:52.310
and my fitness software
tells me exactly

16:52.312 --> 16:53.778
how and when I should eat.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.015
Who needs a plastic inhaler

16:57.017 --> 16:59.751
when you have silicon chips?

16:59.753 --> 17:02.620
If we want to push our bodies
to the limit

17:02.622 --> 17:04.689
we need to upgrade
our processors.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.723
I want to totally erase the line

17:06.726 --> 17:09.160
between man and machine.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.069
I'm Stacey.

17:19.071 --> 17:22.240
At 14, I founded my own
venture capital fund

17:22.242 --> 17:25.742
which I sold at 16
for an undisclosed sum

17:25.744 --> 17:29.213
but instead of retiring
as a high school sophomore

17:29.215 --> 17:31.115
I figured I could transition

17:31.117 --> 17:34.519
into a second career
in the start-up world.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.322
Through my father,
I've had the pleasure

17:38.324 --> 17:40.625
of knowing Linus
since I was born

17:40.627 --> 17:43.795
but I assure you
I am no product of nepotism.

17:43.797 --> 17:47.065
Some of us just have brands
with built in pre-awareness.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.834
Alright, come on, come on!

17:55.542 --> 17:57.642
Hey, man.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.444
Very well, go ahead.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.779
I'm, uh, Mateo.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.582
So I couldn't afford video games
when I was a kid

18:04.584 --> 18:07.685
and, uh, I built my own.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.321
And by the time I was ten,
I had an arcade in my garage

18:10.323 --> 18:13.825
and a couple years later
I bought my first car

18:13.827 --> 18:15.793
with 1600 rolls of quarters.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.730
You know, games for me,
I-I think they're more than

18:19.732 --> 18:21.499
just entertainment,
I think they can be art.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.468
I think they can transport us
to different worlds.

18:23.470 --> 18:27.605
And I think they can unlock
doors to-to different lives.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.340
That's what I plan
to do with this.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.708
So thank you.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.483
Wonderful, thank you for sharing

18:38.485 --> 18:40.651
Marvelous.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.154
This is what it's all about.

18:43.156 --> 18:47.625
Talent, passion, ideas.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.428
But I brought you here...

18:50.430 --> 18:52.864
'cause that's not enough.

18:52.866 --> 18:56.267
It's the market
that drives innovation.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.303
You disagree?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.540
Ideas drive innovation,
not money.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.510
I can crowd-source my funding,
create open source software

19:05.512 --> 19:07.592
and let the hive mind
make it even better.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.481
Please, go ahead,
don't let me stop you talking

19:10.483 --> 19:12.817
about how I should just gift
my company away.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.828
Hi, I built an app that helps

19:23.830 --> 19:25.930
connect people
from all around the world

19:25.932 --> 19:28.366
to collaborate on free software.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.402
The people we know online don't
just have to be our friends.

19:31.404 --> 19:35.439
They can be our our designers,
our engineers, our scientists.

19:35.441 --> 19:38.376
If the world's best programmer
lives in a small village

19:38.378 --> 19:41.646
in the Sudan,
I want to find her.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.582
With my app, we open up
software development to everyone

19:44.584 --> 19:46.851
to help build tools
for everyone.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.587
It's a social network
for like-minded people

19:49.589 --> 19:52.523
to share their ideas together
to create a better world.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.792
I've seen your app.
It's, um, quite interesting.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.527
The possibilities are endless.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.363
Setting up communication systems
after natural disasters.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.045
Payment plans
in the third world countries.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.203
Creating a search algorithm
that can compete with Titan.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.639
Thank you.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.884
Well said.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.648
Very good.
Very good and very small.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.718
See, you have an opportunity

20:20.720 --> 20:23.487
to revolutionize
the way companies deal

20:23.489 --> 20:24.722
with their employees.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.890
Actually...

20:28.595 --> 20:30.528
you could make
employees obsolete.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.832
This is not summer camp.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.367
It's not an internship.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.769
It's not an apprenticeship.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.571
I don't need you to go
and get my tea.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.839
Thankfully,
I have an Oxford grad

20:41.841 --> 20:43.374
who already does that for me.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.511
This is a competition.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.547
Be ruthless.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.451
Thank you.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.525
Your app is great.
You're gonna be fine.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.427
I don't need this from you
right now, okay?

21:03.429 --> 21:05.396
I have a lot going on.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.431
For the record,
I agree with you.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.933
Your dad's a dinosaur
on this one.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.534
Yeah, her dad's dead, so...

21:12.372 --> 21:14.939
It's a little more
complicated than that.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.908
From the, uh, court transcripts
I read, it's pretty clear cut.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.613
Seems Springer didn't even
have to take a paternity test.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.483
- What's he talking about?
- Family court files are sealed.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.286
I was, I was going to tell you
at a better time.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.554
And having a capital letter
and a number in your password

21:30.556 --> 21:32.390
will keep out Russian hackers.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.626
I'm sorry. Who, who are you?
Don't answer that, alright.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.295
I-I'll just hack in your
smartphone in five minutes

21:37.297 --> 21:38.796
and find out myself.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.332
Except I'm over smartphones.
So I got a dumb phone.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.774
Hacked into phone companies
to get free nights and weekends.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.070
Sounds like a challenge.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.538
Please, by all means.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.839
Oh, and, uh, don't you worry.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.074
Juvenile court records
are sealed, too

21:50.076 --> 21:52.043
so, it'll be our little secret.

21:52.045 --> 21:54.945
Your presence is requested
in Linus Springer's office

21:54.947 --> 21:57.315
in four minutes.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.450
You hear that?
I am T-minus one minute late

21:59.452 --> 22:03.421
for a meeting with Springer.
We'll talk later. I promise.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.423
You. Mind your own business.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.106
Congratulations.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.774
You're the first person
to dress me down

22:23.776 --> 22:25.376
in my new building.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.011
You really need a decorator.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.195
Physical objects
hold no interest for me.

22:33.653 --> 22:34.785
Go ahead.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.556
Try it.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.395
There's no reason
we should limit ourselves

22:44.397 --> 22:46.063
to things we can touch.

22:49.635 --> 22:52.002
I've been reading up on you.
Impressive.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.507
Computers and I
come together naturally.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.709
Some would say it's in my DNA.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.845
Eh. DNA is just code.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.483
Code is a pretty big part
of my life.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.952
Well, don't give other people
credit for your hard work.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.520
It's intelligence and ambition

23:09.522 --> 23:11.602
that got you
where you are today, not DNA.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.426
What? What's so funny?

23:15.428 --> 23:16.994
Eighteen years,
and neither of us

23:16.996 --> 23:18.116
has anything nice to say.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.398
Yes, well

23:20.400 --> 23:22.700
personal conversation
is overrated.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.168
I prefer action.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.736
So let's take action.

23:27.006 --> 23:30.074
Okay, what do you want to do?

23:30.076 --> 23:32.510
I don't know.
Why don't you wow me?

23:34.814 --> 23:36.046
Okay.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.048
All right. Come on.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.684
Prepare to be wowed.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.629
Live search terms...

23:51.631 --> 23:53.831
being sent to our servers
from around the world.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.967
A thing of beauty, isn't it?

23:56.969 --> 23:58.803
It's like
stream of consciousness poetry

23:58.805 --> 24:00.171
written by the Internet.

24:00.173 --> 24:03.541
Yes. I like to remind
my employees

24:03.543 --> 24:05.876
there are people
using these products.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.545
Medical devices. Directions.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.780
You still need employees, huh?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.148
For now, yes.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.454
Have you been to Level Zero?

24:16.456 --> 24:19.590
Sorry, I unfortunately do not
have access at this time.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.160
Yes, well,
we can change all that.

24:30.069 --> 24:33.070
Now, this
is a very early prototype.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.152
It'll be the fastest
3D printer ever made.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.842
Not just polymers.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.143
Circuits

24:39.145 --> 24:41.145
optics, prosthetics,
you name it.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.948
This little puppy can build
just about anything.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.716
When's it going on shelves?

24:45.718 --> 24:48.219
I'm not building
it to put it on shelves.

24:48.221 --> 24:50.221
I'm building it
to put it on Mars.

24:51.757 --> 24:53.924
The last piece of the puzzle...

24:53.926 --> 24:56.227
is organics.

24:56.229 --> 24:59.997
If you're 250 million miles
from the nearest hospital

24:59.999 --> 25:02.800
wouldn't it be useful
to print your own kidney?

25:02.802 --> 25:04.101
That's not a kidney.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.004
No, you're right. It's not.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.873
It's, it's you.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.857
Hello, Jessie.

25:14.647 --> 25:17.287
See? I do have
a sense of humor.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.439
Any more surprises
on Level Four?

25:22.955 --> 25:25.189
Nothing really Earth shattering.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.525
All the really cool stuff
is on Level Zero.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.160
What's on Level Zero?

25:31.697 --> 25:33.297
Come along.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.569
Is this the basement where
you're hiding the jet packs?

25:40.740 --> 25:43.874
Down here, young lady,
is the Internet.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.910
I was expecting more porn.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.981
You know why I came back
to this building?

25:50.983 --> 25:53.050
A combination
of fish and nostalgia?

25:54.854 --> 25:56.153
It was more than that.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.758
You mean like how before
it was a fish market

26:00.760 --> 26:02.826
this building hosted
the first telephone exchange

26:02.828 --> 26:04.194
on the West Coast

26:04.196 --> 26:06.597
o-or the first
computer to computer network

26:06.599 --> 26:07.831
in North America?

26:07.833 --> 26:09.133
And then?

26:09.135 --> 26:10.901
And then you have
your own "Meet me" room.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.870
All those cables are from
different service providers

26:12.872 --> 26:14.638
and connect right there.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.740
- Also known as...
- The Internet.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.208
Right.

26:18.210 --> 26:21.111
All those wires, all those zeros
and ones, ones and zeros

26:21.113 --> 26:22.947
they all flow through me.

26:25.217 --> 26:28.052
It's information.
It's everywhere.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.587
And we control it
right down here

26:29.589 --> 26:30.854
in this nervous system.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.224
Connect agencies,
connect teenagers.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.759
You name it. We connect it.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.195
And it's all controlled...

26:39.098 --> 26:40.164
in these rooms.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.233
Come on.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.073
So, what do you do
with all those ones and zeros?

26:50.810 --> 26:52.276
I win.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.946
We know our users better
than they even know themselves.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.882
Ambitions. Dreams.
Hopes. Desires.

26:58.884 --> 27:01.352
We are uniquely positioned
to provide them the service.

27:01.354 --> 27:04.221
We are the ultimate
service provider.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.038
What do you say we take
a look inside, eh?

27:11.163 --> 27:14.331
Oh, Jessie,
no, please. Security.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.735
It's not for social.
Just something to show mom.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.838
I wanted to say...
Look, I, um...

27:20.840 --> 27:23.073
I just didn't wanna be
on the hook for a child

27:23.075 --> 27:25.042
I wasn't sure was mine.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.011
You never even checked.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.812
Does it matter?

27:28.814 --> 27:31.348
You're 18. You're doing great.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.284
Would you have got this far
if I'd handed everything to you?

27:34.286 --> 27:36.053
So you did me a favor.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.989
Why else do you think
you're here?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.924
To win. Thank you for the tour.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.760
It's been inspirational.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.142
Hey.

28:32.144 --> 28:35.145
Sorry if I came in
a little hot earlier.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.480
I take my privacy seriously

28:36.482 --> 28:38.148
and I should have
respected yours.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.983
Privacy is dead.

28:39.985 --> 28:42.252
O-only if we let them
take it away.

28:42.254 --> 28:45.756
- Uh, Cyborg Hunter 727.
- What?

28:45.758 --> 28:47.324
You know, in case
you want to find me.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.607
I don't feel like I have
many secrets left from you.

28:53.766 --> 28:54.765
How many are
you keeping from me?

28:54.766 --> 28:57.086
Think you might be right
about the dead privacy thing.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.308
So how was quality time
with dad?

29:04.310 --> 29:06.243
My boyfriend's cheating on me

29:06.245 --> 29:07.878
with a cheerleader.
All the cliches.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.513
Oh, my God, how many times
have we been over this?

29:09.515 --> 29:11.915
- I-I've apologized enough.
- I know. I'm sorry.

29:11.917 --> 29:15.052
It's just this whole thing
is super weird.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.287
I'm, I'm glad you're here.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.189
It's nice to have
a familiar face.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.958
I know. And ass?

29:20.960 --> 29:24.161
- Don't forget my ass.
- Nobody could forget your ass.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.496
Maybe I shouldn't
have come here.

29:25.498 --> 29:27.097
Springer just wants
to take RightClique

29:27.099 --> 29:28.832
and run the world
from a former fish market.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.300
Wow.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.035
You know, for an idealist,
you're quite cynical.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.871
Well, he doesn't have
my app yet.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.906
Yeah, but he will tomorrow
when you present it.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.775
You're gonna kill it.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.877
You just, you need, like,
a tagline or something.

29:39.879 --> 29:43.380
"RightClique, Making
Global Local with Social."

29:43.382 --> 29:45.549
No, that's terrible. Ugh!

29:45.551 --> 29:47.317
Springer thinks he can
control the Internet.

29:47.319 --> 29:50.521
But he can't. No one can.
And I'm not gonna help him.

29:50.523 --> 29:53.056
So what are you going to do?

29:53.058 --> 29:56.393
Gonna make something new.
Something a little more Titan.

29:56.395 --> 29:59.396
You worked on this app
for about 10 months, right?

29:59.398 --> 30:01.298
You think you're gonna come up
with something else overnight?

30:01.300 --> 30:02.800
It's not gonna happen.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.968
What Titan really needs
is a tool

30:04.970 --> 30:06.970
for people to say how they
really feel about each other.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.906
You know,
not this fake like culture.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.240
Not anonymous trolling, either.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.876
If you're enemies, say so.
Brutal truth.

30:12.878 --> 30:14.311
Anti-social networking.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.913
Yeah, I see the funding
pouring right in for that.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.182
That's great.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.817
You're self-destructing again.

30:19.819 --> 30:22.186
No, I'm finally
seeing things clearly.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.590
So what are you guys working on?

30:26.592 --> 30:28.425
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna steal any ideas

30:28.427 --> 30:30.260
worth less than $25 million.

30:31.997 --> 30:34.431
- Pitch me.
- What?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.600
Pitch me your app.
What do ya got?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.970
It's a first-person
shooter game.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.538
And it uses your phone's camera

30:41.540 --> 30:44.141
to superimpose the game
on the world around you.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.611
Hmm, so you must love Titan's
first-person shooter game

30:47.613 --> 30:49.880
that they're releasing
in a few months.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.449
- What?
- Titan has a game like this?

30:52.451 --> 30:57.287
Yes, every tech company
has a reality shooter game.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.609
That's not really what you're
pitching tomorrow, is it?

31:01.327 --> 31:03.126
Wow.

31:03.128 --> 31:05.028
Well, don't worry. I...

31:05.030 --> 31:06.964
I make things happen.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.326
I think a little brutal truth
could be useful right now.

31:10.302 --> 31:13.470
Hey, let the code monkey go.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.606
I think you and I
have a lot to discuss.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.183
Andi, Level three, please.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.201
I'm not blind.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.040
Right? I'm not blind!

32:23.042 --> 32:25.709
I want their money.
It's that simple.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.545
Maybe you do have something
in common with your father.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.250
Nobody cares about your past.

32:33.252 --> 32:37.054
It's all about your future.
It's all about your future.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.489
Hello, Andi.

32:39.491 --> 32:43.226
Welcome to Titan
International Technology

32:43.228 --> 32:44.962
and Communications.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.968
I just didn't wanna be
on the hook for a child

32:50.970 --> 32:53.403
I wasn't sure was mine.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.585
Some of us just have
brands with built in pre-awareness.

33:18.464 --> 33:22.099
App presentation.
50 minutes past due.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.267
No, no, no, no, no!

33:31.276 --> 33:34.144
RightClique is a collaborative
workflow solution

33:34.146 --> 33:35.479
that connects
software developers

33:35.481 --> 33:38.348
and engineers
from all around the world

33:38.350 --> 33:41.051
for seamless
social project creation.

33:43.288 --> 33:44.688
"RightClique

33:44.690 --> 33:48.525
Making Global
Local with Social."

33:48.527 --> 33:51.128
Thank you all so much.
Thank you.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.530
Very good. Very good indeed.

33:53.532 --> 33:57.234
Very good indeed. "Voila,"
as the French like to say.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.503
I'm so excited I might dance.

33:59.505 --> 34:02.572
Hey, Todd. No, what's the...

34:02.574 --> 34:03.814
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

34:05.310 --> 34:07.577
He stole it.
You know he stole it.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.047
He says
you developed it together.

34:10.049 --> 34:13.650
We bounced ideas off each other,
but it was my app. My code.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.686
Where's the girl who likes
to share things gone?

34:16.688 --> 34:18.088
Mateo saw the potential

34:18.090 --> 34:19.623
he took a risk,
that kid has balls.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.558
- You can't teach that.
- You can't do this.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.094
I can and I did, as per
your agreement with Titan

34:24.096 --> 34:25.661
I'm well within my rights to.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.233
Both of you...
Both of you are horrible.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.601
I think you should use this
as a teaching moment.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.442
This what you think
parenting is?

34:38.444 --> 34:40.277
This is what life is, Jessie.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.547
You're angry. You should be.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.514
Use that.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.217
Be ruthless.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.536
Where were we, Todd?

35:06.538 --> 35:09.639
Yeah. Now the future looks
bright from where I'm sitting.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.161
Yeah.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.147
Jessie, open up.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.850
Come on, I'm sorry.

35:19.852 --> 35:22.212
I just couldn't let you waste
the opportunity like that.

35:25.390 --> 35:26.723
Jessie, come on.

35:29.828 --> 35:32.229
Look, I-I did it for both of us.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.730
Shut up!

35:37.736 --> 35:40.270
You want ruthless,
I'll show you ruthless.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.441
Open source this.

35:50.349 --> 35:51.748
Eighteen years old,
and on the way

35:51.750 --> 35:53.250
to an eight-figure bank account.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.586
And a hot piece of ass.

36:04.796 --> 36:08.365
You know, the future belongs
to those who take it.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.499
You're ruthless.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.201
I do. I'm ruthless.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.937
Come here.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.205
What?

36:17.476 --> 36:18.808
- Too easy.
- Uh...

36:18.810 --> 36:20.777
Do you really think
that's a good idea?

36:20.779 --> 36:22.712
I'm not driving, officer.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.681
What? "Stand on one wheel,
say the alphabet backwards."

36:24.683 --> 36:26.416
Come on, let's ride. It's fine.

36:28.187 --> 36:29.719
- Okay.
- Yeah?

36:29.721 --> 36:31.421
- Let me see... Okay.
- Hey!

36:31.423 --> 36:33.423
If it isn't a risk,
it isn't worth it.

36:34.226 --> 36:35.559
Alright, let's get outta here.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.402
Morning, everybody.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.444
Good to see you again, Jessie.

37:24.576 --> 37:25.675
What's wrong?

37:27.446 --> 37:28.778
Mateo.

37:39.424 --> 37:43.426
- So Mateo was driving?
- The car was driving.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.363
He was in the driver's seat and
you were in the passenger seat?

37:46.365 --> 37:47.797
Passenger seat, yes.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.934
But he dropped me off.
The car dropped me off.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.569
I got dropped off, okay?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.439
I know.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.917
I think that if-if we're not
driving the car

38:07.919 --> 38:09.753
then we didn't steal it.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.389
You know, if that's not a rule,
it should be.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.594
Woo-hoo!

38:18.964 --> 38:20.730
- What, are you sick?
- Can you stop the car?

38:20.732 --> 38:22.999
- Real quick?
- Don't ask me. Ask the car.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.935
- Can you just put...
- Andi, stop the car.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.671
Sorry, it is not
safe to stop the car here.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.506
- Andi!
- Stop it!

38:29.508 --> 38:31.041
Sorry, it is not
safe to stop the car here.

38:31.043 --> 38:32.676
Look, okay, it's stopping.
It's stopping.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.944
Car stopping.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.946
Get out. Don't throw up in here.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.452
Whoo!

38:42.454 --> 38:44.020
Is that how you remember it?

38:45.524 --> 38:47.757
Do you remember it?

38:49.594 --> 38:50.827
Where did you get that?

38:50.829 --> 38:53.596
You posted it last night.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.932
So, everyone's seen that?

38:55.934 --> 38:57.033
Everyone.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.803
Am I trending?

39:14.653 --> 39:15.785
Have a seat.

39:17.489 --> 39:18.755
Your car drives itself, huh?

39:20.559 --> 39:25.829
You see, it's the computer
inside the car that drives it.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.698
Can I see the computer's
drivers license?

39:32.137 --> 39:34.504
Our software
is a thousand times safer

39:34.506 --> 39:36.106
than any human driver.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.809
Surely doesn't look that way.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.847
Any malfunction was human,
not machine.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.548
The car

39:45.550 --> 39:50.053
tracks its own location,
atmosphere, tire pressure

39:50.055 --> 39:52.389
and it sends back the data

39:52.391 --> 39:53.857
from the servers
to my engineers.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.792
I'll be happy to show
what they find.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.762
Give me the data and
I'll let you know what's on it.

39:58.764 --> 40:02.766
Give me a subpoena
and I'd be happy to share it.

40:02.768 --> 40:04.467
Okay.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.104
Uh...

40:08.106 --> 40:10.673
The, uh, car

40:10.675 --> 40:13.176
could someone from here
manipulate it remotely?

40:13.178 --> 40:14.878
You mean hacked?

40:16.548 --> 40:18.481
Yes.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.950
You bring me the human being
who can hack my computer

40:20.952 --> 40:23.119
and I will give him a share
of my company.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.524
I gotta write that down.

40:28.593 --> 40:29.926
Big words.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.767
No point eavesdropping.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.537
Our conference rooms
are soundproof.

40:40.539 --> 40:43.206
It's like he doesn't care
about anybody but himself.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.442
He thinks on a different scale.

40:45.444 --> 40:48.711
He believes technology
is going to save the world.

40:48.713 --> 40:51.548
In the meantime, he's not
bothered by the details.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.817
Details like Mateo?

40:53.819 --> 40:56.085
Or his daughter?

40:56.087 --> 40:58.021
He didn't think you'd show.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.523
Well, he doesn't know me.

41:00.525 --> 41:01.825
I moved your call.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.093
They're on hold
and ready for you.

41:04.095 --> 41:05.728
Jessie.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.730
- Yes?
- Your mother's here.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.575
Mom, what are you doing here?

41:18.577 --> 41:20.477
The department might
have her on probation

41:20.479 --> 41:21.945
but she's still your mom

41:21.947 --> 41:23.580
and the best tech mind
on the force

41:23.582 --> 41:26.983
so I'm happy
to have her any day.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.184
Have a seat.

41:32.157 --> 41:36.659
So, uh, when did you
last see Mateo?

41:36.661 --> 41:38.828
Yesterday, after
the app presentations.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.497
You, uh, you two dated, right?

41:40.499 --> 41:43.132
We broke up about a year ago.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.568
He and Stacey, they got
pretty close pretty fast.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.730
He's free to make whatever
mistakes he wants.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.141
Tell me about, uh...
RightClique

41:52.143 --> 41:54.777
That's the app you said
he stole from you, right?

41:54.779 --> 41:56.846
Mateo stole RightClique?

41:56.848 --> 41:59.949
He tried. It doesn't matter.
It belongs to Titan now.

41:59.951 --> 42:02.719
Must've pissed you off.
I mean, it would piss me off.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.721
I was mad,
but I would never hurt him.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.258
Your ex-boyfriend steals
your idea

42:08.260 --> 42:10.860
hooks up with a new, rich,
cute girl

42:10.862 --> 42:14.597
and the next morning,
poof, he's gone.

42:14.599 --> 42:17.634
To be honest,
it doesn't sound so good.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.569
I think we're getting
ahead of ourselves here.

42:19.571 --> 42:22.138
We have a jilted kid
whose ex-boyfriend

42:22.140 --> 42:23.673
stole a million dollar idea
from her...

42:23.675 --> 42:26.242
- Billion. Billion dollar.
- Oh, exactly.

42:26.244 --> 42:29.579
Jess, where were you last night?

42:31.716 --> 42:34.684
In my room, on my computer.

42:34.686 --> 42:36.719
I just need to know what were
you doing on your computer

42:36.721 --> 42:37.887
and we can clear all this out.

42:37.889 --> 42:40.690
Surfing, hanging out, gaming.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.692
Are you aware that
the app that you created

42:42.694 --> 42:43.860
that you said
Mateo stole from you

42:43.862 --> 42:46.129
was hacked last night?

42:46.131 --> 42:47.797
Should we add Mateo
to the enemies list?

42:47.799 --> 42:49.032
Is Mateo your enemy?

42:49.034 --> 42:51.935
- Ramon, enough.
- It's complicated.

42:51.937 --> 42:53.570
Sure sounds like it.

42:53.572 --> 42:54.704
Jess.

42:54.706 --> 42:55.872
Nope.

43:01.146 --> 43:02.745
Jess.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.047
Jess, stop.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.419
What did you do?

43:09.420 --> 43:11.087
Mateo is an ass,
but I would never hurt him.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.989
Okay. I just want to know.

43:12.991 --> 43:15.892
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

43:15.894 --> 43:17.927
- Yeah.
- You do?

43:17.929 --> 43:19.295
Then I want you to come home

43:19.297 --> 43:23.266
because the money
is not worth it... okay?

43:23.268 --> 43:25.101
I'm not doing this
for the money.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.769
And you know that.

43:32.143 --> 43:35.111
Then I just, like, blacked out.

43:35.113 --> 43:37.647
I'm just, I'm really lucky
to be alive, you know?

43:37.649 --> 43:41.217
Back in the competition,
obviously, but...

43:41.219 --> 43:44.187
So it's just back to work?

43:44.189 --> 43:48.758
Uh, yeah. Jessie, you need to
learn to compartmentalize.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.661
Look, I could have died, okay?
But I didn't.

43:51.663 --> 43:54.397
And there's a lot
of work to do, so...

43:54.399 --> 43:56.299
You're a monster.

43:56.301 --> 43:59.736
Wow. Does, does that mean
that I'm your enemy?

44:01.206 --> 44:03.740
We all know you created
KillList.

44:03.742 --> 44:05.942
Actually I've been
meaning to check out the app

44:05.944 --> 44:07.710
because it's getting
so much traction.

44:07.712 --> 44:08.911
You know, everyone's using it.

44:08.913 --> 44:10.413
So I did, a-and I saw

44:10.415 --> 44:14.150
that you don't have
any enemies yet

44:14.152 --> 44:18.921
but I'm willing to help you out
in that department.

44:18.923 --> 44:20.657
You have a new enemy.

44:20.659 --> 44:22.091
Watch your back.

44:22.093 --> 44:24.193
I can't believe you guys
are using this.

44:24.195 --> 44:26.162
It's called
software development.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.731
That requires, you know,
using software.

44:29.968 --> 44:31.434
I can't get it to work
on my phone.

44:31.436 --> 44:33.903
You know what, Jessie,
you were right.

44:33.905 --> 44:35.738
It's, it's really freeing
to be able to tell people

44:35.740 --> 44:37.140
you hate their guts.

44:38.777 --> 44:40.109
Check this out, guys.

44:40.111 --> 44:42.378
"Thirty three ways a job
in tech will kill you."

44:42.380 --> 44:44.147
Number six will
literally toss you

44:44.149 --> 44:46.249
over the side of a bridge
in a self-driving car.

44:48.353 --> 44:49.952
Aah! What the hell?

44:49.954 --> 44:51.821
Has being plugged
into those machines

44:51.823 --> 44:54.257
robbed you of your
basic human decency?

44:54.259 --> 44:56.693
I think my bitch detector
is malfunctioning.

44:56.695 --> 44:59.429
Beep, beep.
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.

44:59.431 --> 45:02.165
No, it seems to be operational.

45:27.859 --> 45:29.859
Sorry. I-I thought I was alone.

45:31.796 --> 45:34.163
We're never alone.

45:34.165 --> 45:35.231
Are you following me?

45:36.768 --> 45:39.268
Just following my curiosity.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.306
How'd you do it?

45:43.308 --> 45:45.408
Do what?

45:45.410 --> 45:47.243
I mean, if you wrote
RightClique in the first place

45:47.245 --> 45:50.246
rewriting the code
wouldn't be so hard.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.608
You know, impressive you did it
so fast, but you're good.

45:53.218 --> 45:55.284
I get it.

45:55.286 --> 45:57.887
But how did you get the KillList
into Titan servers?

45:57.889 --> 45:59.856
Or send updates remotely?

45:59.858 --> 46:02.125
I don't know
what you're talking about.

46:02.127 --> 46:05.261
Backdoor?
Brute force attack?

46:05.263 --> 46:07.830
Is Titan's password
just password?

46:09.367 --> 46:11.801
Nobody can hack Titan.
It's impossible.

46:11.803 --> 46:14.270
Everything is hackable.

46:16.908 --> 46:19.075
How do I know I can trust you?

46:19.077 --> 46:21.277
'Cause I came to you

46:21.279 --> 46:24.113
and not to Springer or the cops.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.382
Theoretically, if I were
to build an app for Titan

46:26.384 --> 46:28.417
I would make sure
that my baby would

46:28.419 --> 46:32.054
call home occasionally
and check in.

46:32.056 --> 46:33.990
Titan thinks
they're the backdoor

46:33.992 --> 46:36.993
but actually you are.

46:36.995 --> 46:38.060
Theoretically.

46:40.532 --> 46:42.331
Well done.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.903
Sorry to bother you.

46:46.905 --> 46:49.038
I'll, uh, let you get back
to your phone

46:49.040 --> 46:51.174
or whatever it is
people do these days

46:51.176 --> 46:53.209
when they're by themselves.

47:23.174 --> 47:26.209
Andi, workout complete.

47:26.211 --> 47:29.011
Monitor vitals during
regeneration and cooldown.

47:29.013 --> 47:31.981
You have reached
40 percent of cooldown.

47:31.983 --> 47:35.384
Please replenish with
energy drinks and vitamins.

47:42.894 --> 47:43.926
Ew.

47:47.599 --> 47:49.165
Don't let them get to you.

47:52.003 --> 47:53.903
Andi, lights on.

47:55.874 --> 47:59.275
Andi... lights on.

48:00.478 --> 48:03.179
Andi, check vitals?

48:03.181 --> 48:04.947
Monitoring vitals.

48:04.949 --> 48:08.217
Please replenish with
energy drinks and vitamins.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.485
Really?

48:17.896 --> 48:19.295
Andi, unlock the door.

48:21.566 --> 48:22.598
Unlock the door.

48:23.935 --> 48:26.102
Your heart rate is low.

48:26.104 --> 48:29.372
Administering adrenaline
and electronic stimulation...

48:29.374 --> 48:31.574
That's not actually what I need.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.009
Administer steroid.

48:33.011 --> 48:34.944
Your heart rate is dropping.

48:34.946 --> 48:39.415
Administering emergency
external atrial stimulation.

48:41.419 --> 48:43.452
Andi, please, please!

48:48.059 --> 48:50.159
Andi, please!

48:54.299 --> 48:55.631
Pull the damn plug.

49:24.062 --> 49:25.528
Good morning, Jessie.

49:25.530 --> 49:28.097
Your enemy has been defeated.

49:28.700 --> 49:29.732
What?

49:35.006 --> 49:36.038
No.

49:40.545 --> 49:42.178
What...

49:42.180 --> 49:43.312
"Not available."

49:48.486 --> 49:49.518
No.

49:53.591 --> 49:55.057
You would've
thought his robot suit

49:55.059 --> 49:56.692
would have saved him.

49:56.694 --> 49:58.694
Two kids in two days?

49:58.696 --> 50:00.997
That's why you don't trust
your life to a machine.

50:00.999 --> 50:02.531
Well, when something goes wrong
with the machine

50:02.533 --> 50:05.434
you don't blame the machine,
you blame the engineer.

50:05.436 --> 50:06.535
He built it himself,
you're saying that

50:06.537 --> 50:09.071
he dugged his own grave then?

50:09.073 --> 50:11.073
I think he was fine
until he plugged into Titan.

50:11.075 --> 50:13.275
Titan was driving Mateo.

50:13.277 --> 50:14.710
Titan has got
a lot of engineers.

50:14.712 --> 50:16.545
There's a lot of blame
to go around.

50:16.547 --> 50:18.667
Maybe this time we don't
blame the engineer.

50:20.451 --> 50:22.218
Maybe we blame the CEO.

50:42.540 --> 50:45.207
The key is to go very slowly

50:45.209 --> 50:48.110
and work the muscle until
complete and utter fatigue.

50:49.414 --> 50:50.746
A body hack.

50:52.450 --> 50:56.118
Work... 20 minutes a week.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.788
What are you doing
to these kids?

50:58.790 --> 51:01.090
I'm giving them the opportunity
of a lifetime.

51:01.092 --> 51:03.059
If they live, you mean?

51:03.061 --> 51:04.760
Maybe this industry isn't
the right one for them.

51:04.762 --> 51:06.695
You of all people
should know that.

51:06.697 --> 51:08.364
No.

51:08.366 --> 51:10.499
No, it's kind of hard
to stay ahead in the game

51:10.501 --> 51:12.368
when have a small child
depending on you.

51:12.370 --> 51:15.171
Hmm. Decisions.

51:15.173 --> 51:17.173
Sacrifices.

51:17.175 --> 51:18.607
If I had a teenage girl,
I wouldn't put her

51:18.609 --> 51:20.242
in front of a computer screen.

51:20.244 --> 51:23.079
Where was your parenting advice
when I needed it?

51:23.081 --> 51:24.647
I'm going to need
all of the Andi logs

51:24.649 --> 51:26.082
and depending on what I find

51:26.084 --> 51:29.251
I'm probably going to
need everything.

51:29.253 --> 51:31.520
On the desk. Feel free.

51:31.522 --> 51:35.424
Just, uh, leave your subpoena
there, would you?

51:35.426 --> 51:37.693
And I'm probably going to need
to see your badge.

51:39.730 --> 51:42.364
My attorneys, huh, they're
sticklers for the details.

51:42.366 --> 51:44.206
They're very good as you know.

51:48.172 --> 51:49.371
They better be.

51:50.308 --> 51:51.807
I'm watching you.

51:56.447 --> 51:58.747
And I'm watching you.

52:09.694 --> 52:10.726
Come on.

52:17.802 --> 52:19.535
Jess, it's mom.

52:23.307 --> 52:25.741
Did you hear about
what happened to Ping?

52:25.743 --> 52:27.743
I, I messed up.

52:27.745 --> 52:29.712
I was playing
around with the app

52:29.714 --> 52:32.748
and I got locked out
of the source code.

52:35.720 --> 52:39.255
- You added an enemies list.
- I was angry, but...

52:39.257 --> 52:41.624
Oh, Jess.
Somebody hacked the hacker.

52:41.626 --> 52:45.394
I didn't, I didn't hurt anybody,
okay?

52:45.396 --> 52:47.429
This is really bad.
Do you...

52:47.431 --> 52:49.698
I know, b-but we can...
We can fix this.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.834
We can find out who did it
a-and stop it.

52:51.836 --> 52:53.836
No, no, no. That's my job.
I'll do it.

52:53.838 --> 52:55.871
Mom, I can't let you be fixing
another mess of mine.

52:55.873 --> 52:57.840
It's fine. What are they
going to do, fire me?

52:57.842 --> 52:59.475
I'm already on probation.

53:03.414 --> 53:04.446
What?

53:06.717 --> 53:09.552
Do me a favor,
try to get off campus.

53:12.290 --> 53:15.257
Stay off of Titan's network.

53:15.259 --> 53:17.660
I wish you could find a friend,
somebody you trusted.

53:17.662 --> 53:20.296
I really don't
want you here alone.

53:20.298 --> 53:21.330
Shoot.

53:36.547 --> 53:37.713
I need your help.

53:39.650 --> 53:41.517
Have you tried restarting
the computer?

53:41.519 --> 53:43.485
I am not in the mood
for jokes right now.

53:43.487 --> 53:45.621
You are the only one
who's not on RightClique

53:45.623 --> 53:47.656
KillList or any of it.

53:47.658 --> 53:49.491
I've tried to get it to work
on this thing

53:49.493 --> 53:50.693
but I took it to the Genius Bar

53:50.695 --> 53:51.860
and they were stumped.

53:51.862 --> 53:52.895
We need to talk.

53:57.335 --> 53:58.801
Then we should get out
of the Titan fishbowl

53:58.803 --> 54:01.370
where they're not listening.

54:01.372 --> 54:02.671
That was the idea.

54:02.673 --> 54:03.939
I know this place
that's got the best food

54:03.941 --> 54:05.441
on the West Coast.

54:05.443 --> 54:06.809
It should be open.

54:19.690 --> 54:22.725
I didn't realize how hungry
I was.

54:22.727 --> 54:25.928
I feel so much better just getting
out of there for a while.

54:25.930 --> 54:28.264
We all need to disconnect
and reboot sometimes.

54:30.334 --> 54:31.533
Thank you.

54:32.637 --> 54:34.870
Where did you find this place?

54:34.872 --> 54:36.472
Well, I was driving by one day

54:36.474 --> 54:38.507
and couldn't find anything
about it online

54:38.509 --> 54:39.608
so I had to try it.

54:39.610 --> 54:41.010
I like it.

54:41.012 --> 54:45.514
Just hopefully good food
and other human beings.

54:45.516 --> 54:49.451
Just keep it offline,
and it'll never be ruined.

54:49.453 --> 54:54.056
I wish I could share these
amazing carnitas with the world.

54:54.058 --> 54:57.593
- Sacrifices.
- Now you sound like Springer.

54:57.595 --> 55:01.330
Those are not the kind of
sacrifices I'm talking about.

55:01.332 --> 55:02.831
You know, for someone
who likes technology so much

55:02.833 --> 55:04.700
you sure do a lot to avoid it.

55:04.702 --> 55:08.304
- Computers are evil.
- So why do you work with them?

55:08.306 --> 55:11.440
So when our robot overlords
eventually conquer humanity

55:11.442 --> 55:12.642
I'll know how to defeat them.

55:14.879 --> 55:17.199
Computers can't be much worse
than most people I know.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.684
Computers may be
rising up right now

55:25.489 --> 55:26.672
to take over Titan boot camp.

55:26.673 --> 55:29.073
The craziest part is that
you might actually believe that.

55:29.960 --> 55:32.628
I appreciate the simplicity
and logic behind technology.

55:32.630 --> 55:34.496
Without human greed,
we could do great things.

55:34.498 --> 55:36.832
Green technology,
fight human hunger

55:36.834 --> 55:38.954
have all human knowledge
at our fingertips.

55:40.104 --> 55:42.671
So you're not doing this
for the money?

55:42.673 --> 55:44.573
I didn't say that

55:44.575 --> 55:47.135
but I don't need much to finance
the kind of things I want to do.

55:48.846 --> 55:52.081
What about you? Any, uh,
major felonies recently?

55:53.884 --> 55:56.085
No felonies to speak of,
thanks to my mom.

55:56.087 --> 55:58.554
The world does like to punish
those who expose the truth.

56:05.796 --> 56:08.764
My school spent ten years
covering up for that creep

56:08.766 --> 56:11.834
in the math department,
I told the world the truth.

56:11.836 --> 56:14.837
Maybe hacking into
the school newspaper

56:14.839 --> 56:17.806
alerting the local press
was a little overkill, but...

56:17.808 --> 56:19.041
You did the right thing.

56:19.043 --> 56:21.076
Just a bummer
your mom took the fall.

56:23.748 --> 56:26.648
Yeah. She saved my ass.

56:26.650 --> 56:28.530
And it almost cost her her job.

56:30.888 --> 56:33.021
I'm afraid things are going to
be even worse.

56:33.023 --> 56:35.858
So you hacked your own app
and created a kill list.

56:37.061 --> 56:39.661
It's just another
harmless prank.

56:39.663 --> 56:41.663
It doesn't feel
so harmless right now.

56:41.665 --> 56:43.699
Listen, Mateo was a drunk

56:43.701 --> 56:47.136
behind the wheel of some
untested buggy hardware.

56:47.138 --> 56:48.604
Ping trusted technology
with his life

56:48.606 --> 56:50.439
and tech fails all the time.

56:50.441 --> 56:53.675
- Yeah, I know, but...
- There's no murderer.

56:53.677 --> 56:56.779
Just... sloppy code
and terrible accidents.

56:59.784 --> 57:00.949
I hope you're right.

57:33.050 --> 57:34.530
Yeah.

57:36.687 --> 57:39.087
I think that the publicity could
be of good thing, you know?

57:39.089 --> 57:40.756
- You do?
- Yes.

57:40.758 --> 57:42.991
Well, well, I'm not
going to argue with you.

57:42.993 --> 57:45.194
Um, look, you just make
yourself comfortable.

57:45.196 --> 57:47.496
I'll check on my screens
for the...

57:47.498 --> 57:50.599
Can I ask you
something inappropriate?

57:50.601 --> 57:52.201
- Inappropriate?
- Mm-hmm.

57:52.203 --> 57:54.970
Well, yes, I
do believe you could.

57:54.972 --> 57:56.538
How inappropriate...

57:58.108 --> 57:59.174
Are we talking?

57:59.176 --> 58:01.176
Oh, my goodness.

58:01.178 --> 58:03.679
Well...

58:03.681 --> 58:07.483
I think that you should move up
the release of RightClique.

58:07.485 --> 58:09.885
I think you should get it
into the wild immediately.

58:09.887 --> 58:11.153
You want to know what I think?

58:11.155 --> 58:12.855
What?

58:30.274 --> 58:31.940
- Hang on.
- What?

58:31.942 --> 58:33.141
Did you hear that?

58:33.143 --> 58:34.877
- Uh, Linus.
- What?

58:34.879 --> 58:36.211
Linus...

58:37.615 --> 58:39.882
Right or wrong,
the app has buzz.

58:39.884 --> 58:40.916
Yes.

58:40.918 --> 58:41.950
And I think it could be

58:41.952 --> 58:43.652
a big project.

58:43.654 --> 58:47.523
And I think that you should
lead it yourself.

58:47.525 --> 58:49.725
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Mm-hmm.

58:49.727 --> 58:54.696
I also think that
it's a very nice night out

58:54.698 --> 58:57.266
and you should enjoy the view.

58:57.268 --> 59:01.236
Uh, well, the view looks
pretty good from here.

59:01.238 --> 59:04.072
KillList is
broadcasting your location.

59:04.074 --> 59:07.175
Congratulations,
you have a new enemy.

59:07.177 --> 59:09.044
Watch your back.

59:09.046 --> 59:10.178
Oh, damn it.

59:46.216 --> 59:47.215
Hello.

59:47.217 --> 59:48.784
You should really turn that off.

59:48.786 --> 59:52.888
The data of yours,
broadcasting everything.

59:52.890 --> 59:54.256
I mean, if you don't
want to be tracked.

59:54.258 --> 59:55.290
What?

59:59.597 --> 01:00:01.597
My mom's in the hospital.

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:19.615
She has severe swelling
from the blow to her head.

01:00:19.617 --> 01:00:21.350
She needs time to heal.

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.755
You have to find
whoever did this.

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:29.391
I will.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:35.263
Lost track of you last night.

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:38.266
Are you following me?

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:40.836
Titan knows where everyone is
but for some reason,

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:42.204
they couldn't find you.

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:46.108
You think I did this?

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.709
To my own mother?

01:00:47.711 --> 01:00:49.845
I think a series
of unfortunate coincidences

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:53.281
is starting to feel more like
a connected string of events.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:57.853
I can't figure out

01:00:57.855 --> 01:00:59.354
if you're the perp

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.922
or the next victim.

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.358
Either way, just...

01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:06.928
Just watch your back, Jessie.

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:09.931
Just watch your back.

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.810
Mommy feeling okay?

01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:56.845
Who are you?

01:01:56.847 --> 01:02:00.415
You can't hide
in your room forever.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.118
Get out of here.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.388
I can't leave. I'm everywhere.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.457
Okay.

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:11.259
You want an enemy...

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:13.428
you've got an enemy.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.964
Andi, accept all enemies.

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:18.834
Thank you. All
enemies accepted.

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:20.902
An enemy would like to meet you.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.071
Print shop. Five minutes.

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.474
Good job, Andi.

01:02:25.476 --> 01:02:27.442
You're welcome, Jessie.

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:44.860
- You?
- Me what?

01:02:44.862 --> 01:02:47.963
- You're the one doing this.
- You set the meeting.

01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:51.032
How did you even get up here?
It's restricted.

01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:54.536
Well, I granted
Linus special access,

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.838
so Linus granted me
special access.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.874
Yeah. Does he know
you're hacking RightClique?

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:02.310
Do I look like a nerdy hacker?
No offense.

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:04.246
Absolutely none taken.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.783
Okay, but seriously,
you need to straighten

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:09.017
this whole thing out, okay?

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:10.252
We're going live
with RightClique soon.

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:11.486
You need to work out
all the bugs

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:12.521
like how Tinder keeps trying

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:14.022
to set me up with my cousin.

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:15.104
He doesn't even have a car.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.160
What is that?

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:25.167
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

01:03:25.169 --> 01:03:27.135
What were you gonna do, cut me?

01:03:29.273 --> 01:03:32.307
I should have known your
white trash ass was a killer.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.229
What were you
going to do, Jessie?

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:38.046
Listen, I know
your little ex-boyfriend

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:40.282
wanted in on this action

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:42.417
but that's no reason
to get all stabby.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.188
Stacey, let go of the knife.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:49.124
- I swear I am not doing this.
- Why are you doing this?

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.229
- Who's doing this?
- What are you talking to?

01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:56.498
Who is doing this?

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.500
Please don't kill me!

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:00.435
Please don't kill me!

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:02.971
Jessie, please don't kill me.

01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:57.659
She's totally lost it.
I think I have a concussion.

01:04:57.661 --> 01:05:00.562
If she wasn't poor,
I would sue her.

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:03.665
What the...

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:11.573
Police! Open up.

01:05:13.277 --> 01:05:17.078
Jessie, I know you're in there.
Open up.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.280
I'm coming.

01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:27.389
I have a warrant
for your arrest.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:29.524
Okay, the-the app.
I can explain.

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:31.092
It was, it was my idea

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.928
but then everything else,
I-it wasn't me.

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:34.696
I don't care about the hack.

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:36.618
You're being charged
with murder.

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:39.601
What? What-what's going on?

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:41.202
We have Stacey's dead body

01:05:41.204 --> 01:05:43.204
with a knife wound
and your prints on it.

01:05:43.206 --> 01:05:45.273
- I gotta take you in.
- I didn't do it.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.108
You don't understand
what has been going on here.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.410
And I need to figure out
who did this.

01:05:48.412 --> 01:05:50.178
I understand.
I gotta take you in.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.646
No, you can't take me in.
I gotta stay here.

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:53.248
I gotta put handcuffs
on you now.

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.150
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:57.118
Please, just let me
figure this out.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.355
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake!

01:06:00.357 --> 01:06:02.157
- What?
- Jessie, Jessie.

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:03.491
- You have to believe me.
- You gotta stop.

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:06.261
I didn't do this.
I'm not the one who...

01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:07.996
- They're going after my mom!
- Jess.

01:06:07.998 --> 01:06:10.078
- They're going after my mom!
- Jess. Jess.

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:13.702
I didn't do it.

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:15.236
I didn't do it!

01:06:24.381 --> 01:06:26.247
Your mother is a good woman.

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:28.116
I'll make sure
they'll treat you okay.

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:30.018
You have to believe me.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.186
No, I don't.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:38.093
He-hello? Yes, dispatch.

01:06:38.095 --> 01:06:39.127
Pass it through.

01:06:41.298 --> 01:06:43.164
I'm calling from
the consumer credit department...

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:44.733
- What?
- Regarding a pending transfer

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:47.102
in the amount of $12,000
from your checking account.

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:49.104
No, no, no, no,
cancel-cancel it.

01:06:49.106 --> 01:06:50.372
Before I can go
any further, I first

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:51.706
need to confirm your identity.

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:53.174
What is your mother's
maiden name, sir?

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:54.743
I didn't authorize
any-any transfer.

01:06:54.745 --> 01:06:56.444
To protect the
privacy of our customers

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:57.645
we can't discuss your pending
transfer any further

01:06:57.647 --> 01:06:59.247
until I confirm your identity.

01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:00.281
When you first set up
your account

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:01.783
you chose a security image.

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:03.551
Can you describe that
security image to me, sir?

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:05.587
My mother's maiden name
is-is Castro.

01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:07.322
Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. That's
not what we have on file.

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:08.757
This is crazy.

01:07:08.759 --> 01:07:10.291
I'm sorry you
feel that way, sir.

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:11.526
Would you be interested
in taking a survey

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.094
to help improve
our customer service?

01:07:13.096 --> 01:07:14.763
- Just stop the transfer!
- Of course, sir.

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:17.098
If you would like to stop
the pending transfer

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.300
you can proceed to our nearest
authorized banking location.

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.536
Our records indicate
the closest near you

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:24.272
is on... the corner
of 14th and San Pedro.

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:27.142
I can't do that right now.
I'm transporting a prisoner.

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:29.778
This is crazy.

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.646
I see you have a new
credit card on the account.

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:34.516
Shut up. Just tell me
where to go, and I'll go.

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:36.251
Corner of 14th and San Pedro.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:37.786
Okay, going right now.

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:49.330
Wait in the car.

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:54.769
I'm at the corner,
but I-I don't see

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:57.372
any buildings or any-any banks.

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.643
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

01:08:01.645 --> 01:08:03.685
Open... Hey, open.
Open the door! Open...

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:09.150
- Whoo!
- Nice social engineering.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:11.386
Some problems call
for a low-tech solution.

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:13.822
I figure every hacker went
through a lock-picking phase.

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:15.690
Some of us were lucky enough

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:18.292
to practice
on our mom's equipment.

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:20.662
Where to? Fugitive's plan.

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:23.098
- Titan.
- That's crazy.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.566
Whoever's doing this,
whoever attacked Mateo

01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:26.134
Stacey, and Ping,
they're going to kill my mom.

01:08:26.136 --> 01:08:27.435
They have to be at Titan.

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.237
How are you gonna find them?

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:31.106
No one can erase
their digital footprints.

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:33.508
We all leave them. You know
that better than anyone.

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:34.809
So you did read me up.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:37.444
Come on, Cyborg247,
quite the player.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:40.115
Anonymous. WikiLeaks.
Playing Twitter pranks on ISIS.

01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:42.183
You have Edward Snowden
on your Tor Instant Messenger.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:43.618
Just because I hang out
in some interesting corners

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.353
of the web
doesn't make me a criminal.

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:47.455
Quite the opposite. It makes
you someone I can trust.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:50.191
- So what's the plan?
- I don't know.

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:51.626
But someone once told me
everything's hackable.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.894
Right here. Let's go.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:56.564
Here we go.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.569
The key is avoid the cameras.

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:04.872
Some problems call
for low-tech solutions.

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:11.712
Alright. Up there,
they can see everything.

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:13.148
Act normal.

01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:34.402
- Still have your earpiece?
- In here.

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:37.238
Okay. Seriously?

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.640
I was right, wasn't I?

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:41.209
Let's see if they
stripped your access.

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:44.179
- Where are we going?
- Straight to the heart.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.787
Andi, open the door please.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.194
I guess they haven't updated
the guest list.

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:06.968
Or maybe they did.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.739
Keep your head down.

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:19.747
- It's too late.
- Springer's office?

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.552
"Meet me" room.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.421
I don't think we're gonna have
access to that at this hour.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:28.289
I'm not asking Andi.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:29.991
Fire exit.
We'll take the stairs.

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:32.227
Won't that set off the alarm?

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:33.761
I guess it's already gone off.
It won't get any worse.

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:34.862
Good job, boy genius.

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:02.357
That's locked.
That's a fire hazard.

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:04.325
I mean, I-I realize
we're committing a felony

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:05.660
but imagine if we weren't.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:08.997
Ladies first.

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:21.609
Andi, open the door.
It was worth a shot.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:24.746
- How do we get in?
- We use the password.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:30.718
Oh, Jessie, no, please.
Security.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.888
It's not for social.
Just something to show mom.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:37.392
Acoustic cryptanalysis?

01:11:37.394 --> 01:11:40.061
Each button emits
a distinct frequency.

01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:42.563
Everything leaves
a digital trail.

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:43.831
Springer should have known.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:45.466
Someone's always watching.

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:54.542
I've been here before.
In this room.

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:56.544
Impossible.

01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:58.613
Besides me, the only other

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:00.648
who had the admin password
is dead.

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:06.754
- It's not him.
- That's right.

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:08.389
He's not.

01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:13.361
When the dead take your
company down from within,

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:15.663
it does make one wonder.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:18.499
And sometimes, well

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.768
the only choice you have

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.071
is to let the dead
make a mistake.

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:26.441
Just because you're dead
doesn't mean they

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:27.842
revoke your access.

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:34.082
- And I don't make mistakes
- Mateo.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.887
That lady who offed herself
left behind the keys.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:41.389
"Later Gator."

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:44.726
L-8-R-G-8-R.

01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:46.928
Her password.

01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:49.130
Am I seriously the only one
who figured that out?

01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:52.066
Oh.

01:12:52.068 --> 01:12:53.768
You're behind all this?

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:57.572
Ping? Stacey? My mom?

01:12:57.574 --> 01:12:58.773
They got in the way.

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:02.543
It didn't have to be
like this, you know?

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.879
It really didn't.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.948
Aren't you sick and tired

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:08.616
of being the poor kid?

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:09.951
Oh, where you going?

01:13:09.953 --> 01:13:12.053
Where you going?

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:13.855
Being treated like a pawn?

01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:17.625
Springer, you never
wanted my game.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.027
I was bait.

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:21.562
I was sent here to fail.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:24.832
Yeah, but he should have known.

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:27.034
No, no.

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:29.470
There are no more secrets
here anymore.

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:32.039
You knew he was my father.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.474
Of course I knew.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.411
What, you think
this fool over here

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:38.646
is the only one
who can hack court records?

01:13:38.648 --> 01:13:41.549
Hmm? It was all for you, Jessie.

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:44.585
Where you going? Huh?

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:47.655
We will get our revenge.

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:49.490
I thought we'd take down
your father.

01:13:49.492 --> 01:13:51.959
I thought once again,
just you and I, Jess

01:13:52.796 --> 01:13:54.962
we would be happy.

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:56.164
Hey, Ian.

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.531
- This is crazy.
- I never asked for any of this.

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:07.842
And that is why
I had to do it for you.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:10.011
By "it," you mean
kill these people?

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:13.014
Well, as far as
everyone knows, I'm dead.

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:15.183
But you three...

01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:16.951
you have some problems,
don't you?

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.787
Yeah, two notorious
online criminals

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.489
on the run from the law.

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:23.491
I mean, grand theft auto,
really?

01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:25.793
Really?

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.915
That's the best plan
you could come up with?

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:32.667
And the high-flying CEO

01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:34.469
with skeletons in his closet.

01:14:36.606 --> 01:14:38.940
It only makes sense one
of you would go on a rampage.

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:41.042
And then out of guilt

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:43.678
you offed yourselves with a gun
from a 3D printer.

01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:47.882
You guys know how to use
a 3D printer, right?

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:50.885
- It's not right!
- This is crazy!

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:53.754
- Just let her go.
- Just let her go.

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:55.256
Just let her go.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:00.061
You love me.
You love me.

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:03.064
- Don't do this.
- I did love you. No, I did.

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:05.099
I really did, but...

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:09.604
you gotta go.

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:11.172
Bye, babe

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.907
Mateo!

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:24.018
God, we were such
a good match, babe.

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.222
What happened?

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:31.692
You know what happened.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.227
Oh, I know what happened.

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:35.897
It's just you and I.

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:38.633
Don't fucking touch...
Don't touch me.

01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:41.202
Okay, you win, Mateo.

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:53.981
I give in.

01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:56.551
You win.

01:15:56.553 --> 01:15:59.020
There's no way
we're both getting out of here

01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:01.589
unless you let me help you.

01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:02.957
And why should I trust you?

01:16:04.327 --> 01:16:05.560
Why?

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:08.930
It's the only logical play.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.833
The nerd's dead.
Nothing you can do.

01:16:15.138 --> 01:16:17.271
You take care of Jessie,
she takes the fall.

01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:21.075
We both end up looking
like the good guys.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:24.145
Wow. You would really kill
your own daughter?

01:16:31.788 --> 01:16:34.055
I won't let anyone
destroy my company.

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:39.694
You are one cold dude.

01:16:39.696 --> 01:16:41.696
So are you gonna kill her
or should I?

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:44.865
Do you know what?

01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:47.635
On second thought...

01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:49.103
I rescind my offer.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:50.705
What?

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.142
Shut down initiated.

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:57.979
System shutting down.

01:17:08.391 --> 01:17:11.225
Hey. Hey. Hey, Ian.

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:13.761
Ian. Ian.

01:17:13.763 --> 01:17:16.397
Ian. Oh. Oh god.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:17.999
Wait. Don't move.
Don't move.

01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:19.761
Don't touch.
Don't touch.

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:23.971
Stay, don't, don't, don't.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:25.740
Stay.

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:27.775
Okay, okay.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.786
Linus, thank goodness.

01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:41.122
I can't believe this.

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:44.659
- It's horrible.
- It's okay, Barclay.

01:17:46.896 --> 01:17:48.696
It's over.

01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:51.032
It's not over,
it's just beginning.

01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:52.433
What are you talking about?

01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:54.368
We're offline, Linus.

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:56.370
The 100% uptime.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.840
99.9% rounds up to 100.

01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:02.176
It's not funny.

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.078
It's not just Titan.
It's everybody.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.014
- We broke the Internet.
- This is very bad.

01:18:08.818 --> 01:18:11.385
Linus, this is very personal
for you, I realize,

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:13.854
so it's my place
to put the company first.

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:18.459
- Barclay, you're fired.
- I'm sorry, what?

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:20.294
You're in charge
of employee access, correct?

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:22.463
- Yes.
- Yes, well, perhaps,

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:25.733
when someone dies,
you should delete their password

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:28.135
so that some 18-year-old hacker
can't destroy the company.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:31.806
This is personal time,
I realize,

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:33.928
but it's my place to put
the company first.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:36.877
You can't do this.

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:39.947
I am Titan.

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:42.316
I am the voice of Andi.

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:44.752
I'm sorry. Unfortunately,

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.714
you do not have access
at this time.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.048
You saved my company.

01:19:15.017 --> 01:19:16.450
I don't want your money.

01:19:17.487 --> 01:19:18.753
I'm not offering you my money.

01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:20.121
I'm offering you my influence,

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:22.022
my lawyers.

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:23.457
You're in a lot of trouble.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:26.260
I can help get you out
of those problems.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:36.270
What am I accepting?

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.839
You develop your app for me...

01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:40.174
and Titan protects you.

01:19:40.176 --> 01:19:41.408
In turn, you protect Titan.

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:42.777
Pretty standard stuff.

01:19:46.082 --> 01:19:48.983
And if I don't accept
your... offer?

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:51.819
Don't be silly, Jessie.

01:19:51.821 --> 01:19:53.220
You're facing real jail time.

01:19:57.927 --> 01:20:00.461
No, I don't accept.
Not this time.

01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:05.132
You stole a cop car, Jessie.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:07.034
If anyone finds out
what happened,

01:20:07.036 --> 01:20:08.836
Titan goes down.

01:20:08.838 --> 01:20:10.871
You need me
more than I need you.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.409
You're ruthless.

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:18.078
It's in my DNA.

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:22.016
Bye.

01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:25.920
What do you want?

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:37.998
I thought she'd be up by now.

01:20:39.869 --> 01:20:41.168
She's gonna be okay.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.912
I know.

01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:54.515
I'm gonna go, okay?

01:20:58.354 --> 01:20:59.920
Did she just move?

01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:04.859
She just moved.
Go get somebody. Mom. Mom.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:09.597
I'm so sorry.

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:13.334
You're gonna be okay.

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:19.940
My baby.

01:21:19.942 --> 01:21:21.342
I love you.

01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:36.657
I love you too.
