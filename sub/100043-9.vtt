WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.336
This one's from me.

00:02.336 --> 00:05.214
The ribboning isn't my best.
I have carpal tunnel.

00:05.214 --> 00:07.341
My new company
is putting me up at The Prescott,

00:07.341 --> 00:09.218
a luxury residence with full amenities.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.929
I admit, this extravagant lifestyle

00:11.929 --> 00:13.430
can make me a little uncomfortable.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.015
Gentle, Marta.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.684
Another candle. Thanks, everyone.

00:17.768 --> 00:22.523
Alex, you should know that a crook works
at the hair salon downstairs.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.775
Adolfo of Venice.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.610
Isn't he the colorist to the stars?

00:26.610 --> 00:28.862
Thank you for asking,
even though I know you know.

00:28.946 --> 00:34.618
I hate him. Adolfo of Venice
is actually Alan Cartman of Bakersfield.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.412
We started as hairdressers together,

00:37.496 --> 00:39.665
but he stole my hair dye formula.

00:39.665 --> 00:43.377
For a family of generally lovely people,
we sure have a lot of rivals.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.754
Uh, you know what?
It's been fun, but it's time to go.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.423
But you haven't even opened
the candle that Cam and I got you.

00:48.507 --> 00:51.385
And don't we get a tour of the building?
This place has everything.

00:51.385 --> 00:56.139
Um, an archery range, a shark tank, a...
A Westworld?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.392
Sorry. I've got a huge project due.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.018
We can always just explore on our own.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.687
Actually, you can't.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.939
There's a strict
no-unaccompanied-guest policy.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.066
I violate that, they kick me out.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.401
I'll have the valet fetch your cars.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.694
Oh, you can do that from here?

01:08.819 --> 01:11.697
Yeah. Everything's automated.
You just need a resident ID code.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.884
Bye, Phil. Bye.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.136
All right, well, I parked on the street,
so I'll just meet you at home.

01:34.136 --> 01:35.929
Bye, Claire.
- Okay, I need to run to the mall.

01:36.013 --> 01:38.098
Would you pick up some steaks
from the farmers' market for tonight?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.433
Oh, so you did remember it's date night.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.894
I was a little worried
after your response to my Paperless Post.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.812
Oh, come on. You know my "maybes"

01:43.896 --> 01:46.106
- always turn into "will attends."
- Okay.

01:46.648 --> 01:51.403
Aw! When was the last time that you
and I cooked a romantic dinner together?

01:51.403 --> 01:52.654
We did it last week.

01:52.738 --> 01:56.783
I'm not talking about sprinkling
hot dog slices on our DiGiornos.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.456
You couldn't bring my car
before I got in trouble?

02:08.212 --> 02:09.296
Thank you.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.759
<i>I've been secretly moonlighting</i>

02:13.759 --> 02:15.052
<i>as an online food blogger.</i>

02:15.052 --> 02:17.346
"Foodie in a Hoodie."
It rhymes on the page.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.474
I've quickly developed a huge following,

02:20.474 --> 02:21.892
and The Prescott is home

02:21.892 --> 02:24.186
to the city's hottest restaurant,
called Pardon.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.938
Hello.
- Oh, good day, sir.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.483
Forgive me, I'm new here.
Still getting to know each of the tenants.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.151
I'm your concierge, Higgins.

02:31.235 --> 02:34.696
- You look so familiar. Have we met?
- Mmm. Afraid not. No.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.991
I do get that a lot, though.
I have an everyman face and body.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.540
- They're rising.
- Ah, yes. Finley.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.124
Patrols the building for non-residents

02:46.208 --> 02:48.377
using a motion sensor and face scanner.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.421
Useful, yes. But does he have
that uniquely human ability

02:51.505 --> 02:54.925
to anticipate a person's every need?
Coconut water?

02:54.925 --> 02:57.177
I didn't even know I wanted this.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.430
Finley, away.
Anything else I can help you with, sir?

03:00.514 --> 03:01.557
Uh...

03:01.557 --> 03:03.976
No, I'm just headed down
to the restaurant.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.060
Pardon?

03:05.060 --> 03:08.021
- Your in-house eatery.
- Pardon?

03:08.105 --> 03:11.316
You know, waiters,
cutlery, daily specials.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.484
I think it's called Pardon.

03:12.568 --> 03:15.070
- Of course. My mistake. Right this way.
- It's all right.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.406
Avoiding the security robot
would be tricky,

03:17.406 --> 03:18.615
but Finley had a weakness.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.492
He can only detect people
if they're moving.

03:20.576 --> 03:21.702
And it was worth the risk.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.829
Pardon claimed to have
the world's best beef slider.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.123
My followers are dying for a review.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.209
Well, all but one. I have a troll.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.921
Screen name,
"Close-to-Utlaw," wherever that is.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.924
We recently got into a heated comment war.

03:36.008 --> 03:39.011
Insults were hurled, mothers disparaged.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.597
Who knew the Internet
could be so negative?

03:42.264 --> 03:44.057
Table for one. I live here.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.977
- Something just opened up.
- Great. Lead the way. I live here.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.653
Hi. Uh, I'm new here.
Could you lead me to the screening room?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.655
I should think so.
At the butler academy,

03:58.739 --> 04:01.116
I led my class in Leading. This way.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.911
Recently, I got a special edition Blu-ray

04:03.911 --> 04:06.580
of the best movie ever made,
<i>Lawrence of Arabia.</i>

04:07.080 --> 04:09.791
Word is, The Prescott
has a state-of-the-art screening room

04:09.875 --> 04:10.959
with surround sound.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.545
Know what it doesn't have? Manny.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.507
Hello! I would've gone
with a tracking shot there.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.385
I sure hope he finds
a plot out there in that desert.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.681
Behold, our famous candy wall.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.559
- Hey, Sugar Babies.
- Yes, honey buns.

04:27.643 --> 04:30.604
No, Sugar Babies,
the greatest movie candy of all time.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.813
A thousand apologies.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.482
I will track some down
for you straightaway.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.234
- You wouldn't mind?
- Mind? Please.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.485
There is no greater joy than

04:36.485 --> 04:40.113
fetching something I've never
heard of for someone I've only just met.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.246
- May I help you with something?
- Oh! Uh, no, I'm just waiting for someone.

04:47.412 --> 04:51.500
And his name is David Beckham,
resident at The Prescott.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.751
Okay, Mitchell hates it when I do this,

04:52.835 --> 04:54.419
but every time I meet a celebrity,

04:54.503 --> 04:56.505
I ask them to record
my outgoing message.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.007
My current one is from
when I saw Snoop Dogg at a bank.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.260
<i>Sorry I missed you.
As you can see...</i>

05:01.260 --> 05:02.344
<i>I'm busy.</i>

05:02.511 --> 05:05.097
<i>And sometimes things can...
Get away from me!</i>

05:05.097 --> 05:07.558
<i>Please leave a message,
including your phone number,</i><i>just for...</i>

05:07.558 --> 05:08.725
<i>Security!</i>

05:10.227 --> 05:12.104
Hey, sweetie, what's up?
I'm kind of busy.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.481
<i>Cam, I'm hurt. It's my leg.</i>
- What?

05:14.565 --> 05:15.816
<i>I slipped in the food court.</i>

05:15.816 --> 05:18.527
<i>And I'm all sticky,
and tweens are laughing at me.</i>

05:18.527 --> 05:19.695
<i>- You have to come pick me up.</i>

05:19.695 --> 05:23.532
Well, that sounds awful, but...
Isn't Claire closer?

05:23.532 --> 05:25.701
<i>Well, you're at the farmers'
market right down</i><i>the street.</i>

05:25.701 --> 05:27.244
Okay, fine. I'm on my way.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.205
You're the best.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.416
I was not gonna let Cam ruin my chance

05:32.416 --> 05:36.545
to thank my wallpaper,
Victoria Beckham, one-on-one.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.380
Okay. So it was 1997,

05:38.380 --> 05:41.592
I was in Detroit for a Spice Girls
concert with my girlfriend.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.470
I was going to propose to her,
had the ring in my pocket and everything,

05:45.554 --> 05:49.266
when from the stage,
Posh looked right at me and said,

05:49.266 --> 05:51.393
"Be true to yourself, Mitchell."

05:52.060 --> 05:53.395
Okay, she might've said "Michigan,"

05:53.395 --> 05:55.105
but she was looking right at me.

05:55.439 --> 05:58.192
Uh, she inspired me
to come out that night.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.569
I had that diamond reset
as an anklet charm,

06:00.569 --> 06:02.404
and I was off to the races.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.781
What kind of gym bag is that, anyway?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.950
It's a satchel, you ignorant sneeze.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.536
You have been so unpleasant lately.

06:10.078 --> 06:14.041
On a definitely related note,
Manny hasn't gotten any action in months.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.835
Well, other than whatever
gave him carpal tunnel.

06:16.919 --> 06:20.088
Luckily, The Prescott
has an '80s aerobicize class,

06:20.214 --> 06:22.424
which will be full of single older ladies.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.177
Women hit a sweet spot right after 40,

06:25.177 --> 06:28.180
where they still look great,
but their standards have lowered.

06:31.141 --> 06:34.269
You're in pretty good shape
for someone who's 42? 43?

06:34.353 --> 06:36.480
- I'm 38.
- Bye.

06:38.482 --> 06:39.942
Higgins.

06:39.942 --> 06:43.070
Oh, Mr. Beckham. Apologies.
Blind as a bat without these bad boys.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.657
So, myself and Courteney
are expecting a bowling instructor.

06:46.657 --> 06:49.201
Would you have him meet us downstairs
at the bowling alley, please?

06:49.201 --> 06:51.870
You and Miss Cox getting an edge for this
weekend's Celebrity Bowl-a-Thon?

06:51.954 --> 06:54.915
Oh, we'll need it. You should've seen
the way he bowled last year.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.042
I mean, it is to raise money for charity.

06:57.167 --> 07:00.170
Yeah. A dollar for each
of the 18 pins that you knocked down.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.381
Thanks to you,
Doctors Without Borders

07:02.381 --> 07:03.924
are now "Doctors without malaria pills."

07:04.508 --> 07:06.802
A bit harsh.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.727
Did you see the two friends in the back?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.896
The blonde one liked me
and the brunette kept staring at you.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.649
Wait, can you blame her?
No one moves to <i>Caribbean Queen</i> like me.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.903
Oh! Just who I was told
to be on the lookout for.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.322
A certain couple have asked
that you meet them in the bowling alley.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.366
- Was it a blonde and a brunette?
- Indeed.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.201
And they seemed eager to get rolling.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.372
Bowling alley? These girls are freaky.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.667
- Hair salon?
- Just off the courtyard to your right.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.793
Thank you.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.628
I've always wanted to dye my hair dark,

07:41.712 --> 07:45.883
but there's only one colorist
I would trust to do it, Adolfo of Venice.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.259
Gloria's sworn enemy.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.179
<i>I just had to sneak back in
and do it without her knowing.</i>

07:50.387 --> 07:51.388
Oh!

08:03.025 --> 08:04.902
- ALEX <i>Hi, Mom.</i>
- Hi, Alex.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.154
Hey, honey. So, how's the project going?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.530
<i>I'm never gonna make this deadline.</i>

08:09.114 --> 08:12.701
Oh! Yeah, no. That's tough.
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.620
<i>Work is so stressful...</i>

08:14.620 --> 08:15.954
Yeah, I got to go. Love you, bye.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.791
The pool? Just hop on the elevator

08:19.875 --> 08:21.877
and press the big button marked "pool."

08:21.877 --> 08:25.339
I am known as the fearless one
of the family.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.341
So when Claire gave us all free passes

08:27.341 --> 08:29.676
for the Fun Town water park next week,

08:30.260 --> 08:32.971
I couldn't admit
that I am afraid of slides.

08:33.055 --> 08:36.433
They go so fast,
I feel like I'm going to fly off.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.812
I just need to try it once,
and I am going to be fine.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.525
- I cannot do it!
- Hey, no backsies.

08:46.944 --> 08:48.737
Okay. Here I go!

08:52.533 --> 08:56.078
You should
have let me do backsies.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.041
<i>Resident ID access,
hair salon.</i>

09:01.542 --> 09:03.877
What? Who's using my code?

09:05.963 --> 09:10.592
- You look like that actress.
- Audrey Hepburn.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.432
<i>This is Phil Dunphy. Leave a message.</i>

09:18.517 --> 09:21.019
Phil, I have a little surprise
for you later.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.606
Let's just say I know
how much you love brunettes.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.066
- Here's a menu for you.
- Thank you.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.486
And for my followers...

09:31.196 --> 09:34.199
An Instagram tease.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.287
- Your Sugar Babies, sir.
- I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.663
On the contrary,

09:39.872 --> 09:41.623
there was a Mexican birthday celebration

09:41.707 --> 09:43.458
taking place
in the park across the street.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.502
I waited for the crack of the pinata,

09:45.586 --> 09:48.172
mixed in seamlessly with the children,
and pounced.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.512
He's here?

09:55.596 --> 09:58.557
Some moron food blogger
took a shot at one of my favorite spots,

09:58.557 --> 10:01.685
so I go after him using my screen name,
Closet-Outlaw.

10:01.685 --> 10:05.522
It escalates, and he turns
his army of followers against me.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.232
As I wrote in my last comment,

10:07.316 --> 10:10.402
"Let's see how well
my fist pairs with your face."

10:12.613 --> 10:14.114
The bowling alley?

10:16.533 --> 10:19.661
Wait. Alex is here?
If she sees us, she'll throw us out.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.584
Excuse me? If that blonde
or brunette come by,

10:25.584 --> 10:27.503
could you tell them
there's a new meetup spot?

10:27.503 --> 10:29.171
The hot tubs on the rooftop.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.465
Of course. Warm things up
a bit before your workout.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.925
If there's nothing else,
I need to make sure

10:32.925 --> 10:34.676
these balls are marked
with their correct weights.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.057
Ugh!

10:41.642 --> 10:45.354
Hi. A size 10 for him,
and anything with a steel toe for me.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.231
Someone drops his ball a lot.

10:47.231 --> 10:48.607
There has been a change of plan.

10:48.607 --> 10:49.733
Your bowling instructor
would now like you

10:49.733 --> 10:52.110
to meet him in the hot tubs
for a warmup first.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.529
- Meet you up there?
- Yup.

10:54.112 --> 10:57.157
If you're calling the charity
for a new partner, it's not gonna work.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.784
They already made the posters.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.661
- Ready to order?
- Very.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.664
I came to this restaurant
for one thing and one thing only.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.588
And that thing is...

11:11.672 --> 11:13.423
Sorry. One of your world...

11:15.926 --> 11:17.803
One of our world's fattest
hot dogs coming up.

11:17.803 --> 11:18.971
No. The slider.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.598
- And how would you like it.
- Me...

11:23.851 --> 11:24.935
Yes, you, sir.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.437
Medium rare. And can you have it
delivered to the pool, please?

11:27.521 --> 11:29.064
Of course.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.359
Okay, that slider goes to the pool,

11:32.359 --> 11:34.736
and it looks like we need one
for Mr. Beckham to the roof.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.446
You seen a guy in a black hoodie?

11:36.530 --> 11:37.614
- Just left.
- Thanks.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.951
Oh, I'll be back. I'm dying to try one
of your world's fattest hot dogs.

11:49.168 --> 11:52.004
Hey, you here at the mall?
No, not yet.

11:52.004 --> 11:53.255
Why are you breathing so hard?

11:53.255 --> 11:55.507
Oh, a bunch of kids
were vaping next to me,

11:55.591 --> 11:57.676
and I had to army-crawl
into a candle store.

11:58.177 --> 11:59.803
Yeah, is there anything
you want while I'm here?

11:59.887 --> 12:02.472
Can I tell you what I want,
what I really, really want?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.183
You're watching me right now, aren't you?

12:04.391 --> 12:05.517
Oh!

12:05.601 --> 12:08.145
Cam, okay, look,
I was hoping I would run into Posh

12:08.145 --> 12:10.772
here at the gym
for a private moment, okay?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.858
Look, we're both after the Beckhams.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.067
Let's come up with a plan together.

12:14.151 --> 12:17.029
- Meet me at the swim-up bar.
- There's a swim-up bar?

12:17.029 --> 12:18.572
I know! We should be living here,

12:18.572 --> 12:20.490
and Alex should be
living in our stupid house.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.664
Hey!

12:33.212 --> 12:35.839
Higgins, I need you! Where are you?

12:38.759 --> 12:41.678
- A spot of bother, I see.
- I can't do it!

12:41.762 --> 12:42.971
No, of course you can.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.682
Yeah, I'll just crawl in front of you
so you can grab me around the waist.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.684
I apologize in advance for any giggling.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.353
I'm cursed with the tickle gene.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.689
- What's going on?
- There's someone stuck on the slide.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.608
She tried to climb back down, but...

12:54.608 --> 12:56.109
- No backsies. I get it.
- Yeah.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.487
Oh! That's for me. Thank you.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.031
But it goes too fast.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.116
Oh, no, don't worry.
I shall vary the flex of my buttocks

13:03.200 --> 13:04.409
- to control our speed.
- Okay.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.412
This should be a...

13:07.496 --> 13:09.414
My deepest apologies!

13:12.709 --> 13:14.920
Oh, no.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.215
Okay.

13:22.261 --> 13:23.720
No!

13:25.889 --> 13:27.975
That one's sorted.

13:31.395 --> 13:34.273
I need some sparkling water
sent up to the hot tub cabanas.

13:34.273 --> 13:36.942
Can't say for whom,
but let's include a glass of champagne

13:36.942 --> 13:39.528
in case his "posh" wife joins him.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.909
Easy...

13:47.286 --> 13:48.287
Easy.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.956
Come on!

13:52.124 --> 13:54.835
Higgins. Hey, um, listen,

13:54.835 --> 13:57.546
I need your help
getting my hands on the slider.

13:57.546 --> 14:01.425
"The slider"? Oh, of course.
Quite a looker, that one.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.509
Well, that's the problem.

14:02.593 --> 14:04.469
So far I've only been
able to look and not taste.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.140
Say no more. I shall find a way
to deliver the slider to you.

14:08.140 --> 14:11.435
Great. Um, is there someplace private
where I could enjoy the slider alone?

14:12.311 --> 14:14.980
Might I suggest one of our rooftop
hot tubs overlooking the city.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.650
Perfect. I'll wait there.
And I'll need a bib. I can make a mess.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.537
Still crisp. He's close.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.336
How'd I get back here?

14:44.468 --> 14:46.887
- Ah, Posh.
- Thank you.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.555
Your husband has asked that you meet him

14:48.639 --> 14:51.016
up in one of the rooftop
hot tubs for some champagne.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.267
Phil.

15:02.778 --> 15:06.532
Higgins, the slides aren't the enemy.
Fear is.

15:06.532 --> 15:09.159
It's always a thrill to see
one of my residents grow.

15:09.243 --> 15:11.036
By the way, a certain mystery man

15:11.036 --> 15:12.162
has spotted you around the building

15:12.246 --> 15:14.289
and has requested
your presence on the roof.

15:14.373 --> 15:18.001
Jay's finally
doing something romantic.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.671
Just when I thought
he was a clueless grouch.

15:24.675 --> 15:27.302
How many lobbies does this place have?

15:31.682 --> 15:34.226
Excuse me.
Where could I find a bathing suit?

15:34.226 --> 15:35.978
There are complementary suits
in all of the cabanas.

15:36.228 --> 15:39.022
- Ooh!
- Worry not. I boil them myself nightly.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.315
Ah.

15:40.399 --> 15:41.525
Let's see a robot do that.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.903
Higgins, we have a bit
of an unusual request.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.405
Now, we know you need to be discrete,

15:46.405 --> 15:50.284
but we are hoping to have a rendezvous
with a certain distinguished Brit.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.953
- Hmm?
- Consider it arranged.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.329
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.629
- Still no sign of the ladies.
- Maybe they're in a different cabana.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.759
- Mine's here.
- Let's wait for the blonde.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.803
I only know how to do this
with even numbers.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.889
Hello, Mr. Robot.

16:11.889 --> 16:14.808
Uh, can you tell me where to go
for my romantic surprise?

16:14.892 --> 16:16.768
Gloria!

16:23.525 --> 16:25.027
Now mine's here, but yours is gone.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.742
- Now they're both gone.
- They'll be back.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.578
Maybe one of them had a nanny emergency.
Let's wait for them in there.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.414
- Slider?
- Arriving shortly.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.749
- Cabana 3.
- Thank you.

16:40.876 --> 16:41.960
Here we are, then.

16:45.506 --> 16:48.175
- Higgins, what are you doing?
- Oh, role-play.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.595
I know I am but a lowly stable boy,

16:51.595 --> 16:53.138
unwanted in the master's quarters,

16:53.222 --> 16:56.183
but, uh, perhaps you'd like
to teach me a lesson?

16:56.934 --> 16:57.935
Just stay away from the face.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.270
Obviously, there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

17:00.354 --> 17:02.105
Yeah. Do we look like the kind of people

17:02.189 --> 17:05.776
that would be into some sort
of weird role-play involving a stable boy?

17:06.401 --> 17:09.696
I'm assuming he's been naughty
and would do anything to keep his job?

17:09.780 --> 17:10.948
Cam. Cam.

17:10.948 --> 17:13.492
In my defense,
I do get this request quite often.

17:13.492 --> 17:14.785
Particularly around the holidays.

17:14.785 --> 17:19.623
Actually, um, we were hoping
to meet a certain celebrity couple...

17:19.623 --> 17:21.041
- Yeah.
- Say no more.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.209
I make no promises,

17:22.209 --> 17:25.087
but let me just wriggle back
into my shorts and make some inquiries.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.012
Ah! Wonderful timing.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.640
Please step into Cabana 3.
Your mystery man awaits.

17:40.853 --> 17:44.773
Hi. I know that you
and I aren't supposed to be here,

17:44.857 --> 17:49.820
but after today,
I am tired of living a life of fear.

17:49.820 --> 17:53.031
Was Gloria Claire's brunette surprise?

17:53.115 --> 17:57.661
It all started when Claire
gave me a free pass to Fun Town.

17:58.453 --> 18:01.415
I thought, "Just try it today.

18:02.249 --> 18:05.836
"Take a ride. See how it feels."

18:06.336 --> 18:09.548
Oh! Never noticed how sexy your feet are.

18:09.548 --> 18:10.632
Thank you,

18:10.716 --> 18:12.217
but this isn't happening, Gloria.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.514
Oh, there you are.
Sorry we missed you at the bowling alley.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.892
She looked different with a headband on.

18:19.892 --> 18:21.518
Warming up in a hot tub first?

18:22.102 --> 18:25.105
Unconventional. But, hey,
anything to loosen up Becks.

18:25.189 --> 18:28.192
- Did we meet a Becky?
- Maybe. There were so many of them.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.321
- So, how old is this Becks?
- Forty-four.

18:32.321 --> 18:33.405
It's on.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.282
Oh, there you are.

18:38.577 --> 18:43.665
- Wait. You're Becks?
- Yup, and I'm eager to learn.

18:43.749 --> 18:47.419
A warning, my form's clumsy,
but I'm great with my feet.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.425
Okay, who gets the dude?

18:54.176 --> 18:55.469
This never happened.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.724
Fine. I'll take him.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.893
But we're just gonna hang out
and see where it goes.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.523
Mmm.

19:13.487 --> 19:14.530
Pardon the interruption.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.114
It looks like
you're finished with the slider?

19:16.198 --> 19:18.575
I am. And can I be honest?
I prefer bigger buns.

19:18.659 --> 19:21.078
It's wonderful to just talk
like men sometimes, isn't it?

19:21.078 --> 19:22.371
It is.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.668
Jay, what are you doing here?

19:27.668 --> 19:29.795
I spent the whole day
looking for that miserable...

19:32.589 --> 19:35.259
- You're the Foodie in a Hoodie?
- Why would you say that?

19:37.761 --> 19:40.222
- Ketchup!
- I'm trying, but I'm lost!

19:40.222 --> 19:41.682
You insulted my mother.

19:41.682 --> 19:45.936
- Oh, my God. You're Close-to-Utlaw?
- It's "Closet-Outlaw."

19:45.936 --> 19:47.312
Jay, I don't blame you for being mad.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.940
I turned my legions of fans against you...

19:49.940 --> 19:52.150
And it's "Foodie in a Hoodie," by the way,

19:52.234 --> 19:54.111
but you got a bigger problem at home
that I just heard about,

19:54.111 --> 19:55.571
and I think I can help you with it.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.489
- Claire?
- Oh, Gloria,

19:57.573 --> 19:59.032
I can't believe you recognized me.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.784
I'm so sorry about my hair.

20:00.868 --> 20:02.035
I'm so glad

20:02.119 --> 20:04.496
- that we could finally talk about it.
- Yeah.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.958
- Grow it out. Let yourself be a girl.
- No...

20:08.083 --> 20:10.085
Okay, final set of instructions on a day

20:10.169 --> 20:11.837
that will no doubt be a memorable chapter

20:11.837 --> 20:14.173
in my forthcoming memoir, <i>You Rang?</i>

20:14.173 --> 20:16.216
You, Cabana 2. You, Cabana 3.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.093
Oh.

20:19.094 --> 20:22.055
You are a romantic.

20:24.141 --> 20:26.185
Honey, if you don't like my hair,
I can change it.

20:26.185 --> 20:27.436
What? I love it.

20:27.436 --> 20:28.937
Maybe next week, I can arrange

20:29.021 --> 20:31.982
a little rendezvous with a redhead.

20:33.192 --> 20:34.693
Oh... Okay.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.486
I'm glad we cleared that up.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.530
I can't wait
for my bowling lesson with you.

20:38.614 --> 20:42.159
Oh, my God.
Foodie in a Hoodie was here today.

20:42.159 --> 20:45.454
Oh, God, you're great.
When does Posh get here?

20:45.454 --> 20:48.665
And I apologize for being late.
You know, I left a message.

20:48.749 --> 20:49.917
I'm sorry I missed your call.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.001
Can you say that one more time?

20:51.001 --> 20:52.794
I'm...

20:54.963 --> 20:58.175
So, I had a few
"incidental charges" from yesterday.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.844
Two hundred dollars
for Sugar Baby procurement.

21:00.928 --> 21:01.929
Sorry.

21:01.929 --> 21:05.933
- Eight sliders and one coconut water.
- He charged me for that?

21:05.933 --> 21:08.393
Three hundred dollars for a slide rescue.

21:08.477 --> 21:11.480
Forty dollars fine
for the non-wiping of stationary bike.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.857
- I barely sweat.
- You're sweating right now.

21:13.941 --> 21:17.069
A hundred and fifty dollar fine
for the non-return of leg warmers.

21:17.528 --> 21:20.531
And eight $100 Westworld entry fees?

21:22.699 --> 21:26.453
Oh, my God! We left Cam there.
Oh, no.
