00:53.637 --> 00:57.348
Gosh! I guess he got away.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.771
Can Baby Shoes come out to play?

01:06.358 --> 01:09.360
Come on! Hands on your head.
Climb out.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.450
I can't climb out
if my hands are on my head.

01:16.535 --> 01:19.454
Just keep them where I can see them,
man. Come on.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.256
- You high, popo?
- Yeah, man.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.592
Catching morons makes me high.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.011
Lift your shirt up by your collar
and turn around.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.390
Would you look at that?
Dude's got a weapon.

01:42.394 --> 01:46.564
All right.
You have the right to remain stupid.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.191
Watch the gun.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.485
Anything you say will be
completely incomprehensible.

01:50.611 --> 01:54.447
- Seriously, man! Careful!
- Seriously, man? Seriously?

01:54.573 --> 01:56.699
Does your mama know what you do?

02:42.371 --> 02:45.456
Oh. It's sweet. Your dad's proud.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.625
- You made the local paper.
- For my article.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.545
Give it a rest. You read
what he wrote in the margin?

02:50.671 --> 02:54.173
"Our friend Lazarus sleeps,
but I go that I may wake him up."

02:54.299 --> 02:56.467
Yeah. He's not proud of me,
he's proud of Jesus.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.386
Everything I do right is God's work.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.305
Everything I do wrong is
my own damn fault.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.809
Cop with a sense of humor.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.937
Differential diagnosis.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.439
Guy's in the ER, bleeding on everybody.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.275
- Drugs?
- He's a cop.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.485
Good point. How about drugs?

03:14.611 --> 03:18.406
Tox screen was clean.
He did, however, get hit by a bullet.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.408
Just mentioning.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.494
- He was shot?
- No, somebody threw it at him.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.539
I'm thinking trauma. He got
bullet fragments lodged in his brain.

03:26.665 --> 03:29.584
According to Baby Shoes,
the cop was laughing before he got shot.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.294
- Baby Shoes?
- The guy who shot him.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.712
Reliable witness.

03:32.838 --> 03:36.424
His name is Baby Shoes.
How bad can he be?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.719
The fragments are in the wrong part
of the brain to cause euphoria,

03:39.845 --> 03:41.387
so let's expand the search.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.389
Factor in the cough
and the cloudy lungs.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.391
Why are we ignoring
the elevated heart rate?

03:45.517 --> 03:46.559
Because he's in shock.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.895
What if the heart was already fast
before he got shot?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.563
You mean after the foot race?

03:50.689 --> 03:53.316
He's giddy.
Indicates a blockage of oxygen.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.401
Carbon monoxide gas would elevate
the heart rate,

03:55.527 --> 03:57.528
cause coughing
and impair neurological functions.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.907
- He got CO poisoning outdoors?
- Yeah.

04:01.033 --> 04:04.410
All 'cause those bastards
didn't ratify Kyoto.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.872
Or he got CO poisoning indoors
and then moved outdoors

04:07.998 --> 04:10.625
before he'd inhaled enough
to make him drop dead.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.501
Test his arterial blood gas.

04:12.628 --> 04:15.087
If his carboxyhemoglobin levels
are higher than 15%,

04:15.213 --> 04:17.006
stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.

04:17.883 --> 04:20.927
You go check the cop car for gas leaks.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.012
If it was the cop car,
his partner would be sick.

04:23.138 --> 04:26.599
Maybe she is, but just doesn't have
as good a sense of humor.

04:26.725 --> 04:30.061
Also, check his personal car,
his work, home.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.854
I'll check the precinct.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.528
The blood test confirmed you have
low-level carbon monoxide poisoning.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.031
We're putting you inside
a high-pressure chamber that...

04:42.699 --> 04:44.700
You don't really care, do you?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.619
Do you live near a gas supply?

04:47.579 --> 04:51.082
Yeah, me. After, like, a huge enchilada.

04:54.670 --> 05:00.007
Anything toxic you have at your home?
Any paint solvents, anything unhygienic?

05:00.968 --> 05:04.512
No. No, I keep a pretty clean home.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.922
If you have trouble breathing,

06:22.049 --> 06:24.300
you can press this button
and the chamber will decompress.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.470
- Like this?
- Not now. If you have trouble.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.013
- It's broken.
- All right.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.890
If you have problems,
we'll push it for you.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.434
Muscle contracture.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.270
- How bad does it hurt?
- Not at all.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.981
Looks wild, though, huh?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.984
Your brain's not getting enough oxygen.
You're losing motor function.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.321
- We should start this right away.
- Should I be scared?

06:45.447 --> 06:47.823
No, you probably have a
carbon monoxide leak in your place.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.658
We have a guy there checking things out.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.269
Sounds okay.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.939
- How about the gas intake valve?
- Looks great.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.233
It's down in the furnace room.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.152
Your system's fine.
If you had a carbon monoxide leak,

07:25.278 --> 07:26.570
half the force would be sick.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.572
Then why are you here?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.700
I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.621
Yeah.

07:36.081 --> 07:40.668
I've got a disability.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.551
- These are speeding tickets.
- A lot of emergencies.

07:50.345 --> 07:53.681
He's feeling better now,
but you never know.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.977
I'll see what we can do.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.609
Where does your partner sit?

08:09.072 --> 08:12.283
The place is a cesspool, but I don't
think I need to test for anything.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.326
Nope. Waste of time.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.913
- You know about the marijuana?
- I've heard rumors.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.040
The cop's acting high
because he is high.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.459
- He's got...
- Legionnaires' disease.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.253
It's a good thing Joe got shot

08:24.379 --> 08:27.548
or the whole precinct would have gotten
wiped out. Anarchy on the streets.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.508
It takes 48 hours to test
for Legionnaires'.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.927
But only two seconds to recognize
that the symptoms fit

08:32.053 --> 08:34.722
while staring at the rancid,
unchanged water of an AC unit.

08:34.848 --> 08:38.601
Marijuana explains the high carboxy,
the cloudy lungs and the happiness.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.770
Pot doesn't explain the fact that he's
gotten worse since he was admitted.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.105
Why don't we agree to disagree?

08:43.231 --> 08:45.399
Actually, why don't we agree
that you'll disagree with me

08:45.525 --> 08:48.944
while treating him for Legionnaires'?
It's not as pithy, but...

08:50.113 --> 08:53.324
I feel a lot better.
The meds are working.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.536
Heart rate's normal.
COHb levels are down. No fever.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.372
Take some deep breaths.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.627
You seem disappointed.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.503
I'm glad you're feeling better.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.006
- You got a problem with cops?
- Please don't talk.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.176
In my experience people who just don't
like cops have a reason...

09:12.302 --> 09:13.719
I need you not to talk.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.890
No rales.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.101
These clouded areas
of the upper lobes,

09:21.228 --> 09:22.978
they're the infiltrates we found
yesterday.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.648
- They're not there anymore?
- They're clearing up.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.776
You had Legionnaires'. Now you don't.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.279
So, you didn't find anything
at my place?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.701
Nothing medically relevant.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.497
So there's nothing I need
to worry about, then?

09:41.623 --> 09:43.290
Not this time.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.921
What are you doing?

09:49.047 --> 09:51.382
I want to make sure
he sees what's involved.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.425
What we found was fairly advanced.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.095
These cloudy areas here and here,

09:56.221 --> 09:59.014
these parts of your lungs
simply weren't functioning.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.183
But they're okay now, right?

10:04.062 --> 10:05.896
Everything's okay now.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.618
I'm fine.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.456
You're blind.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.419
I bumped into something.
That doesn't mean I can't see.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.588
- I'm sure this is frightening, but...
- What's Doctor Cameron wearing?

10:34.301 --> 10:37.845
Dark blue pants, white shirt,
black shoes.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.348
Almost,
except for the pants, shirt and shoes.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.641
You're blind.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.687
He really thinks he can see?

10:46.813 --> 10:49.023
He can physically see.
His brain just can't process it.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.942
- No chance this is a practical joke?
- No way.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.654
Anton's blindness indicates
damage to both occipital lobes.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.780
It must be from the trauma.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.075
Bullet fragments just happened
to hit the same spot in both lobes?

11:00.201 --> 11:04.371
A stroke could cause Anton's blindness
and euphoria.

11:04.497 --> 11:08.000
Officer Krupke is clotting in his brain.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.295
Start heparin to thin the blood.
Find the clot and yank it out.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.089
The clot would be at the top
of the bilateral vertebral arteries.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.300
Great. Chase,
stick your fingers in there

11:16.426 --> 11:17.885
and grope around until you find it.

11:18.011 --> 11:18.969
Oh, wait.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.721
When you turn him into a vegetable,

11:20.847 --> 11:23.265
then there's going to be
frivolous lawsuits.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.976
You know what would be better?
Contrast MRI.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.144
Do we have one of those?

11:27.270 --> 11:29.480
You can't do an MRI.
If the bullet fragments are magnetic,

11:29.606 --> 11:31.023
they'll move and rip his brain apart.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.984
Well, let's flip a coin.
Heads MRI, tails he dies.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.029
Police-issue Kevlar vests don't have
the ceramic plate insert

11:37.155 --> 11:39.031
that would shatter a bullet.
They would catch it.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.574
So, the bullet shattered on its own.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.868
Meaning Baby Shoes was using
.38 caliber hollow points,

11:42.994 --> 11:45.954
which unfortunately are ferromagnetic.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.045
It's just so cool that you know that.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.047
We could do an angio
to find the clotting.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.300
Waste of time.
The skull creates too much artifact.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.843
We'll never get a decent view.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.137
- It's the next best thing to an MRI.
- And a waste of time.

12:02.263 --> 12:05.265
- An angio might show...
- Oh, God, it's a coup!

12:05.392 --> 12:06.809
Fine, go do your angio.

12:06.935 --> 12:10.145
When you're done wasting your time,
meet me down in the morgue.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.984
We're going to snake a catheter
into your femoral artery

12:16.111 --> 12:18.028
and up into your brain
so we can check for clots.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.657
Keep this on throughout the procedure,

12:21.783 --> 12:24.243
unless the pot's
already made you sterile.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.829
I have a stressful job. You got no idea.

12:26.955 --> 12:30.999
I grew up with cops like you.
One part bully, nine parts hypocrite.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.802
- What is wrong with you?
- Just having some fun.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.179
- The man is sick and scared.
- The man's a crooked cop.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.390
Maybe you should take yourself
off the case, Foreman.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.017
You don't have to like someone
to be their doctor.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.436
Hey, how you doing there, buddy?

12:50.562 --> 12:53.063
Just sit still
and we'll have you back out there

12:53.189 --> 12:55.149
scaring the crap out of people
in no time.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.151
Happy?

12:59.946 --> 13:03.949
- What did the angio tell us?
- What are you looking for?

13:04.534 --> 13:07.077
I called my mom. She didn't pick up.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.037
What did the angio tell us?

13:09.164 --> 13:10.914
That Foreman should be off this case.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.541
He's a neurologist.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.169
Unless you think the patient's
optic nerve is in his spleen.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.837
He doesn't like cops.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.966
Foreman, policemen are our friends. If
you and I ever get separated shopping...

13:21.092 --> 13:23.594
- I was just busting the guy's chops.
- See?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.387
He was just busting the guy's chops.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.639
Foreman is essential
to solving this case.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.975
Medically, what did the angio tell us?

13:30.101 --> 13:32.895
There appears to be some clotting,
possibly around the circle of Willis.

13:33.021 --> 13:36.565
Based on the progression of symptoms,
the clot is growing.

13:36.691 --> 13:37.733
We need to cut into...

13:37.859 --> 13:39.610
Saying that there appears to be clotting

13:39.736 --> 13:41.695
is like saying
there's a traffic jam ahead.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.741
Is it a ten-car pile up, or just
a really slow bus in the center lane?

13:45.867 --> 13:49.495
And if it is a bus, is it
a thrombotic bus or an embolic bus?

13:50.622 --> 13:52.080
I think I pushed that metaphor too far.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.249
Angio can't tell us
that kind of information.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.251
Oh, so you're saying
it was just a waste of time?

13:56.377 --> 13:59.046
It gave us some information
without killing him.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.923
You don't know that an MRI will
kill him.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.674
The bullets have a ferrous base!

14:02.800 --> 14:05.719
Little tiny pieces trapped in his head.
They're not going anywhere.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.847
Maybe it's worth attempting surgery
to remove the fragments.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.475
Surgeons say inoperable
and the patient's on blood-thinners.

14:11.601 --> 14:12.935
Other than that, perfect plan.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.604
- You got a better plan?
- Much.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.822
The bullet's identical to the one
that Baby Shoes popped Joe with.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.658
Let's see how magnetic it is.

14:27.784 --> 14:28.992
Did anybody hear a...

14:30.203 --> 14:31.995
I shot him. He's dead.

14:39.087 --> 14:42.047
The bullet split into four fragments.
No exit wounds.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.675
I only used a half-load of gunpowder.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.512
It won't be exactly precise comparing
the locations on an X-Ray to an MRI.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.848
How unprofessional was Foreman?

14:51.975 --> 14:54.017
Ask him yourself. He's right here.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.061
Worse than usual.
Better than you.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.522
He berated Joe for being a bad cop.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.983
Berated or humiliated?

15:01.109 --> 15:04.152
I'm not sure.
I didn't have my thesaurus with me.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.530
One implies that he took pleasure in it.

15:07.115 --> 15:10.617
I want to know if it was repressed
black anger or just giddiness.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.078
You think I'm sick?

15:13.204 --> 15:17.165
I think that an appropriate response
to watching your boss shoot a corpse

15:17.292 --> 15:18.709
is not to grin foolishly.

15:18.835 --> 15:22.129
The fact that I've grown bored
by your insanity is proof of nothing.

15:22.839 --> 15:26.633
Doctor Foreman,
Doctor Chase requests your assistance.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.264
I can't even imagine the backwards logic

15:32.390 --> 15:34.433
you used to rationalize
shooting a corpse.

15:34.559 --> 15:37.060
Well, if I'd shot a live person,
there's a lot more paperwork.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.938
Then it won't be a problem for you to
stand beside the casket at the wake

15:40.064 --> 15:42.482
and explain why a cancer patient
has a bullet hole in his head.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.319
The man donated his body to science.
Yes, it's a tragedy.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.696
If I hadn't shot him, his body could
have spent the next year

15:47.822 --> 15:50.407
letting first-year med students
use the carpool lane.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.909
- He's set.
- Do not turn that on, House.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.953
You're mad
because I put a bullet in his head.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.164
At worst, all I'm doing now
is taking it out.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.384
My bad.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.195
They have to shut down the magnet
to fix it.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.698
MRI is going to be out of commission
for at least two weeks.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.079
Oh, it doesn't matter. We obviously
can't use it on this patient.

16:37.205 --> 16:41.667
No, but there are other doctors
in this hospital and other patients.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.753
That helps explains how they can afford
all the fancy equipment.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.380
I'm sure not pulling my weight.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.090
Is doing nothing an option?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.095
I'm just saying, maybe the clot will
break up on its own.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.264
- The giddiness seems to have gone away.
- The blindness hasn't.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.266
- Echo his heart.
- Looking for what?

16:58.393 --> 16:59.976
The problem is obviously neurological.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.938
The clots are in his brain.
The source of the clots may not be.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.065
Do a complete
transthoracic echocardiogram.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.151
Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are
coming from his heart.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.868
- Heart's clean.
- Where else could we look?

17:16.994 --> 17:19.371
We could ultrasound his legs,
look for a DVT.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.917
I need you to move over.
Joe, are you okay?

17:24.043 --> 17:26.503
Tachycardia. Heart rate 150 and rising.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.797
Saline wide open. He's bleeding out.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.966
House wanted to thin his blood.
He sure did a good job.

17:31.092 --> 17:34.136
BP's crashing. He's going into shock.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.430
Intracranial bleeding.
We need to relieve the pressure.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.056
We need a surgical team.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.020
- Foreman, get out!
- Boy, is he screwed.

17:44.147 --> 17:47.774
We clot his blood, he dies.
We thin it, he dies.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.237
Am I the only one who finds this funny?

17:58.453 --> 17:59.619
Oh, man!

18:05.501 --> 18:07.169
I'm not sick!

18:08.504 --> 18:10.839
Did you hear the one about the guy
who bled into his brain

18:10.965 --> 18:13.925
and had to have a hole drilled
in his skull to relieve the pressure?

18:14.051 --> 18:15.093
Hilarious.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.263
Someone laughs, they're dying?
That's absurd.

18:18.389 --> 18:19.598
But not funny.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.851
If I'm not sick, all you're doing
is locking me up with the source.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.186
I'll get sick, prove you right.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.314
If you're not sick, it's not contagious
and you've got nothing to worry about.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.150
If you are sick, the two of you are
staying in here until we find out why.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.611
So you might want to make friends
with the pig.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.197
The good news is
I can finally get my MRI.

18:35.323 --> 18:38.116
No, you can't! You blew up the machine!

18:38.242 --> 18:41.578
Not the portable one, chuckles.

18:41.704 --> 18:45.791
Chase and Cameron are bringing it
to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.

18:46.459 --> 18:50.003
- Where are you going?
- To the office. Got work to do.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.839
Eat your meals, take your temperature
every half-hour

18:52.965 --> 18:54.966
and any meds I command you to take.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.302
- So I'm just a regular patient now?
- No.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.971
You get your own thermometer.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.317
Check your blood.

19:12.443 --> 19:16.905
Anyone with an elevated sed rate gets
to be Foreman's new roomie.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.115
- He should be a part of this.
- He's a patient.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.117
- He's not irrational.
- He's not objective.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.286
He's got the most motivation to get
this diagnosed.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.081
Right. You're not even friends with him.
Why would you care?

19:26.916 --> 19:30.836
There is an area of increased T2
attenuation in the cingulate cortex.

19:30.962 --> 19:34.673
- Kind of mushy.
- Cingulate cortex controls emotions.

19:34.799 --> 19:38.802
This mushy spot explains the euphoria.
Question is, what's causing the mush?

19:38.928 --> 19:41.429
A question you might want
to ask a neurologist.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.349
Foreman is a selfish jerk,
but he's a neurologist

19:44.475 --> 19:46.393
and he's the only one who's been in that
apartment.

19:46.519 --> 19:50.522
This is why he shouldn't be here. You
wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.567
If you think he screwed up at that
apartment you'd keep it to yourself.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.777
- No! I...
- Well, we'll never know.

19:55.903 --> 19:59.072
As long as he's not here,
he's just like any other patient,

19:59.198 --> 20:01.449
which means we can dump on him
all we want.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.078
What's eating the selfish jerk's brain?

20:05.204 --> 20:07.330
West Nile
or Eastern equine encephalitis would...

20:07.456 --> 20:09.082
Test Foreman's blood.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.959
Given that he's the only one who got it,

20:11.085 --> 20:14.462
person-to-person transmission is less
likely than some sort of deadly toxin

20:14.589 --> 20:17.215
that Foreman picked up
in the guy's home.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.217
Who wants to go next?

20:28.561 --> 20:33.106
You're ready to sacrifice yourself for
a guy who doesn't consider you a friend?

20:33.232 --> 20:36.192
He's just a patient, right?
It's the job.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.028
Hey.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.906
You don't have to go anywhere.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.575
Joe's apartment is
right downstairs in the lab.

20:43.701 --> 20:46.119
Foreman brought back
samples of everything.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.998
What was that, "Who wants to go next"?
Some kind of test?

20:50.124 --> 20:51.750
Don't worry. You made the right call.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.794
Foreman stumbled
into whatever it is without knowing.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.047
And he's way smarter than you are.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.151
Ow! Damn, Chase!

21:19.070 --> 21:22.405
- You suck at this.
- Sorry, it's this damned suit.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.991
I can do it myself.
And I'll throw that out.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.621
What'd the MRI show?

21:31.207 --> 21:32.749
I can't be a part of the differential

21:32.875 --> 21:34.751
and I can't even know
what the differential is?

21:34.877 --> 21:37.337
You'd have told any other patient
what you found out.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.344
MRI showed a lesion
on your cingulate cortex.

21:45.096 --> 21:46.888
What's the thinking?

21:47.014 --> 21:50.141
Toxins are in the lead,
viral's a distant second.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.018
Do you think the lesion could be
an abscess?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.938
It's just a small, soft area.
More mush than anything.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.857
Was there inflammation in the lining
of the ventricles?

21:57.984 --> 22:00.402
There was an increased signal there,
yeah.

22:02.863 --> 22:06.032
- What are you thinking?
- Staph infection.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.119
Toxins lead to neurodegeneration
which causes the lesion.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.913
- Not without a fever.
- The cop had a fever.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.249
Mine could be coming.
I could have got it directly from him

22:14.375 --> 22:16.167
or a dirty dishtowel at his place.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.836
Give us Ommaya reservoirs.

22:17.962 --> 22:22.132
Deliver linezolid directly
into our brains, and we're cured.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.221
Samples tested negative for toluene,
arsenic and lead.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.472
What about the blood?

22:29.598 --> 22:31.891
Negative for West Nile
and Eastern equine.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.227
We have to go back to Joe's apartment,
get more samples...

22:34.353 --> 22:37.188
No one goes back to that place
until we know what we're looking for.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.316
Get some of that cop tape,
stick it over the doors and the windows.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.318
I'll take all the HAZMAT precautions.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.237
The chance of infection is
next to nothing.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.989
Yeah, I was never that great at math,

22:46.115 --> 22:48.575
but next to nothing is higher
than nothing, right?

22:48.701 --> 22:52.245
- It's not your fault he got sick.
- But it would be his fault if we did.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.497
We should get a sample directly
from Joe's brain.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.707
We can't do a biopsy.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.710
There's too much edema from the bleeding
because you gave him heparin.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.463
I don't think this is the time to be
pointing fingers.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.841
I didn't give Foreman any.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.261
You want to give Foreman a brain
biopsy?

23:08.929 --> 23:11.139
Come on. Really, who doesn't?

23:14.185 --> 23:17.270
This could be a simple staph infection
causing neurodegeneration.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.605
Without a fever? Not a chance.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.857
- Joe had a fever.
- He also had Legionella.

23:20.983 --> 23:24.319
The mush might be forming an abscess,
and since there was inflammation

23:24.445 --> 23:26.362
of the lining of the ventricles,
it makes sense.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.948
The staph releases toxins,
causes neurodegeneration,

23:29.075 --> 23:31.034
- causes the lesions.
- This is a waste of time.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.536
We should put an Ommaya reservoir
in Foreman's brain

23:33.662 --> 23:35.330
and start administering antibiotics...

23:35.456 --> 23:38.208
If I'm going to be arguing with Foreman,
I may as well do it directly.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.182
Kernig's sign, negative.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.980
Brudzinski's sign, single positive.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.949
Patient Joe Luria,
distal and proximal arm contractures.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.492
Duration four seconds.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.997
Staph infection most commonly presents
on the skin.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.750
Most commonly?

24:20.876 --> 24:23.378
You want to treat me
like any other patient, do it.

24:23.504 --> 24:27.006
But the House I know
never uses phrases like "most commonly."

24:28.134 --> 24:30.385
- You're not laughing anymore.
- No.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.888
You think that's a good thing?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.099
Sort of doubt it.

24:37.768 --> 24:41.688
Staph would be in your heart, lungs,
spleen, liver or kidneys

24:41.814 --> 24:43.189
before it gets to your brain.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.941
Your organs are clear. It's not staph.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.610
The infection could be limited
to a brain abscess.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.155
Which I would have seen in your MRI.

24:51.657 --> 24:54.200
Sign this so that I can take out
a piece of your brain.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.414
Let me see the MRI.

25:00.291 --> 25:03.543
- There was no abscess on the image.
- Let me see it, then.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.297
I liked you better when you were jolly.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.642
MRI was taken over an hour ago.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.145
That soft spot could now be an abscess.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.315
If it was staph you'd have a fever,
which you don't.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.359
101.6.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.279
What idiot gave you that?

25:32.114 --> 25:35.617
Put the Ommaya reservoir in my skull
and treat me for the staph.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.249
Triangle.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.836
This one?

25:48.964 --> 25:50.089
Circle.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.301
Next.

25:54.470 --> 25:57.138
Foreman, why aren't you answering?
Is there a problem?

25:57.264 --> 25:59.557
- Square.
- Tell me your date of birth.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.392
Is that House? Yeah.

26:01.518 --> 26:04.229
- Next?
- Square again. Why is he here?

26:04.355 --> 26:07.106
Because my neurologist is
having surgery.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.775
I thought I was just another patient.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.777
You didn't believe that crap, did you?

26:10.903 --> 26:12.153
Date of birth.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.989
The Ommaya reservoir is inserted
in the parietal lobe.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.700
My spatial recognition is the issue,
not my memory.

26:17.826 --> 26:21.955
Oops. Did you say Ommaya?
I could have sworn you said biopsy.

26:22.081 --> 26:26.459
Hey, I'm just messing with your head.
Mother's maiden name, please.

26:27.169 --> 26:29.212
Get out of my temporal lobe, House.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.140
Hello?

26:44.436 --> 26:45.895
Are you awake?

26:47.690 --> 26:50.900
They told me somebody was sick like me.

26:52.069 --> 26:53.194
I'm up.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.116
Your voice...

26:59.743 --> 27:01.369
Aren't you my doctor?

27:03.205 --> 27:05.039
Not anymore.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.501
You're the guy who doesn't like cops?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.504
Yeah.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.631
Can you see?

27:15.217 --> 27:18.177
- You can't?
- Not a thing.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.059
You've been blind a while.

27:25.185 --> 27:29.147
The fact that you're aware of it now
could be a sign of improvement.

27:33.861 --> 27:37.196
It hurts so much, doesn't it?

27:38.741 --> 27:39.866
I'm okay.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.243
It's going to hurt.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.582
The morphine barely takes the edge off.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.170
I'm going to die, aren't I?

27:53.047 --> 27:56.174
You die, I die.
It's not going to happen.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.176
Why not?

27:58.302 --> 28:01.846
Are you just too stubborn to die?

28:01.972 --> 28:03.806
They took a piece of my brain.

28:05.976 --> 28:09.312
Whatever is wrong with us, they'll find.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.320
Do you believe in prayer?

28:24.787 --> 28:25.953
Not really.

28:29.583 --> 28:30.875
Neither do I.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.506
My dad always prays.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.176
So does mine.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.100
Do you want to try it?

28:48.811 --> 28:50.269
Try praying?

28:54.900 --> 28:55.983
Okay.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.295
- How is he?
- Still dying.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.300
Well, you've almost mastered
another skill, though. That's good.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.345
We have Foreman's biopsy results.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.598
Non-specific signs of inflammation.

29:30.144 --> 29:31.102
That's it?

29:31.228 --> 29:34.480
I also swabbed for staph. Negative.
He's not even a carrier.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.486
Well, at least Foreman was wrong, too.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.738
Yeah, there's that.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.201
- Can I go to Joe's apartment now?
- No.

29:48.328 --> 29:52.165
Go back to the lab and start retesting
all the samples that Foreman collected.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.292
- For what?
- Everything.

29:54.418 --> 29:58.171
Bacteria, toxins, fungus,
anything that likes to feast on brain.

29:58.297 --> 30:01.299
- That's thousands of...
- Better hurry.

30:01.425 --> 30:04.010
Cameron, suit up.
You're going to monitor Foreman.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.346
He's on to hand contractures.
He'll be at Anton's blindness soon.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.183
Run hourly checks,
because when he does go blind

30:10.309 --> 30:11.309
he won't be able to tell us.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.436
We'll use the data to construct a
timeline

30:13.562 --> 30:15.354
so we can see how far behind Joe he is.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.941
Why are you still here?

30:26.408 --> 30:28.326
You're being cautious.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.747
You're being common.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.084
When you don't give a crap...

30:37.211 --> 30:40.254
How many of your guys have caught
cancer from their patients?

30:41.256 --> 30:44.300
Let me know when that happens,
then we can have this conversation.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.427
It's just another case, huh?

30:46.553 --> 30:49.514
I'll bet you can even have unprotected
sex with your cancer patients

30:49.640 --> 30:51.182
without catching a damn thing.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.310
Boy, I wish I had your job.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.785
Biopsy showed nothing.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.996
How can it be nothing?
You cut out a piece of my brain.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.165
It's nothing personal.
We just didn't find anything.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.042
Can you up his morphine, for God's
sake?

31:18.168 --> 31:20.711
He's already maxed out.
20 milligrams per hour.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.005
- What about toxins?
- Everything was negative.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.341
There was a cupboard above the stove.
Did you see it?

31:25.467 --> 31:28.219
I didn't check all the food,
but could be listeriosis.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.346
I didn't go back. Follow right.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.223
Who did?

31:32.349 --> 31:34.058
House said we shouldn't go.
Too dangerous.

31:34.184 --> 31:37.061
The answer's got to be in that
apartment. Not going is too dangerous.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.564
- I'm sorry.
- You're thankful.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.734
If House would've pointed at you instead
of me, you'd be the one in here.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.654
Tell me when you can see the light.

31:46.780 --> 31:50.074
It's your job to go back! You're
a doctor! You go where the disease is!

31:50.200 --> 31:51.534
Say when you can see the light.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.078
I'm dying and you're sitting here
measuring how fast I go?

31:54.204 --> 31:56.581
- Tell me when you can see the light.
- My vision is fine!

31:56.707 --> 31:59.250
- Your left-side periphery is reduced.
- It's fine! I'll prove it!

32:00.002 --> 32:02.670
Ow! Son of a bitch!

32:05.382 --> 32:07.091
Now we're both exposed.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.969
You got two choices.

32:10.095 --> 32:13.264
You can go tell House what just happened
and get your own cot brought in here,

32:13.390 --> 32:15.850
or you can go back to that apartment.

32:15.976 --> 32:19.854
You save me, the cop and yourself.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.153
It's not SSPE.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.448
I checked your past vaccinations against
Joe's. No batch matches.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.700
Did the blood show antibodies
for Coxsackievirus?

32:32.826 --> 32:35.953
Guys, can you please shut him up?

32:36.079 --> 32:38.998
- He's over his limit on morphine.
- Where's Cameron?

32:39.124 --> 32:42.251
She said she had some stuff to do.
Said she'll be back soon.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.812
What are you doing?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.191
Foreman!

33:09.571 --> 33:13.824
Imagine being constantly reminded
of the pain you're about to be in.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.242
I can't take it!

33:15.369 --> 33:17.870
Just stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it!

33:19.331 --> 33:22.416
Mainlining morphine into his carotid
could stop his heart!

33:22.542 --> 33:24.543
So could pain-induced
stress cardiomyopathy.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.587
Either the morphine kills him
or the pain does.

33:26.713 --> 33:27.880
You're condoning this?

33:28.006 --> 33:30.383
I'm certainly not going in there
to stop him.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.929
I'm going to make you feel better.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.453
Joe has a new symptom.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.164
Hyperalgesia.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.793
The infection's spreading
into the pain center of the brain.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.884
Make it stop! Make it stop!

34:17.681 --> 34:19.890
His brain is telling him
that his whole body is in pain.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.518
Because of the location,
painkillers do nothing.

34:23.270 --> 34:27.314
Suit up. Put the guy in a coma
before the pain kills him.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.600
What if he used cedar wood
to hide the pot smell?

35:02.726 --> 35:04.518
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.229
- Did you find any cedar wood anywhere?
- No, but maybe...

35:07.355 --> 35:08.689
Maybe what?

35:08.815 --> 35:11.901
Maybe somebody could go back,
take a second look?

35:12.861 --> 35:15.154
And why aren't you pissed off
that Cameron's playing hooky

35:15.280 --> 35:17.198
while your life hangs in the balance?

35:43.975 --> 35:46.852
Why doesn't anyone listen to me
anymore?

35:47.771 --> 35:50.981
- I decided you were wrong.
- God, you're weak.

35:51.900 --> 35:56.487
Guy steals your article,
tells you you're not his friend,

35:56.613 --> 35:58.322
and you still want
to risk your life for him.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.745
Foreman broke my skin
with a tainted needle.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.705
- Wow!
- Yeah.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.708
God, you're weak.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.085
The guy tried to kill you.

36:11.795 --> 36:15.798
First thing on my list of things to do
would be to stab him back, shoot him.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.008
I've got a gun in my desk.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.970
The last thing on my list would be
to lie to my boss about it,

36:21.096 --> 36:22.972
and then give the bastard
everything he wanted.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.891
I'm not here for Foreman.
I'm here to save myself.

36:27.519 --> 36:31.063
Even with a needle stick, your chances
of infection are pretty slim.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.274
That's why you're wearing a suit.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.694
You wanted to be here.
He just gave you the excuse.

36:38.738 --> 36:41.740
What does that guy have to do
to make you hate him?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.254
Give me the bag.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.100
- Mildewed dishtowel.
- To re-test for staph.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.227
What is that? Mouse droppings?

37:10.353 --> 37:13.814
Hamster droppings. Could carry Toxocara.
It'd explain the blindness.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.983
Now that I recognize as oven crud.

37:16.109 --> 37:19.236
Could be meat with Trichinella.
It would explain the high fever.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.072
What's with the rye bread?

37:22.198 --> 37:24.450
Mold could be responsible
for ergot poisoning,

37:24.576 --> 37:26.702
which could explain the contractures.

37:26.828 --> 37:29.204
- There are three loaves.
- So?

37:33.418 --> 37:35.336
You're going back in there.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.258
A guy who lives on take-out pizza
does not buy three loaves of rye.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.969
That's looking too far into the future.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.889
Unless he cares about
something a lot more than his diet.

37:47.849 --> 37:51.435
- Are you on the roof yet?
- Yeah, I'm here.

37:51.561 --> 37:54.772
- I don't see any birds.
- Whistle or something.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.024
Do that "come hither" thing.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.998
They came that fast
because it's their behavior pattern.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.708
Joe's been feeding them.

38:14.834 --> 38:17.044
Now look down.
Do you see a river of pigeon turd?

38:18.672 --> 38:20.881
No. There's barely any.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.716
It's not weird, it's cheap.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.094
Joe's a guy who looks for the easy way.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.763
Probably been stealing cable
from his neighbors.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.641
Why not steal fertilizer
from rats with wings?

38:30.767 --> 38:32.643
You see a shovel or a dust pan?

38:33.561 --> 38:36.063
I found a scraper. It looks used.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.107
Sitting on a bucket.

38:38.233 --> 38:40.526
A bucketful of pigeon crap,

38:40.652 --> 38:44.029
the perfect home
for Cryptococcus neoformans.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.781
Yup.

38:45.907 --> 38:48.075
Fungus enters the brain
through the sphenoidal sinus,

38:48.201 --> 38:49.910
where it dances its triple threat

38:50.036 --> 38:52.871
of happiness, blindness
and intractable pain.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.666
Let's hope this experience teaches
our cop a lesson.

38:55.792 --> 38:58.168
Don't cut corners
when you're growing your pot.

38:58.294 --> 39:00.004
See you back home.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.714
I was there.

39:02.465 --> 39:03.632
I should have found it.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.593
Yeah, you could have saved us
a lot of time.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.222
Get me a flush of ampho B
and flucytosine.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.182
I'll start us both.

39:12.308 --> 39:15.686
I was waiting for lab confirmation.
I haven't heard from House yet.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.563
Look at his EEG.

39:18.815 --> 39:22.026
Theta band's been increasing steadily
since we put him under.

39:22.736 --> 39:24.611
The guy's unconscious,
but still in pain.

39:24.738 --> 39:27.448
Theta bands could indicate
at least half-a-dozen different things.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.366
One of which is pain.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.994
The fact that he's no longer screaming
makes us feel better,

39:32.120 --> 39:33.871
not necessarily him.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.292
Chase?

39:41.337 --> 39:42.963
How's Cameron?

39:44.799 --> 39:46.675
She's not giddy.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.329
Fever's down. White count's improving.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.124
Has she said anything to you?

41:00.834 --> 41:04.503
You mean, like, "I completely understand
why Foreman did what he did

41:04.629 --> 41:06.130
and I hold no grudge?"

41:07.841 --> 41:11.135
What I did, did save my life.

41:22.272 --> 41:24.731
Get in here and help! Forget the suit!

41:24.858 --> 41:27.609
He's tachycardic. Wide complex.
Looks like V-tach.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.320
- It's not Cryptococcus!
- What?

41:30.446 --> 41:32.156
House was wrong.
The samples were negative.

41:32.282 --> 41:33.323
- What is it?
- We don't know.

41:33.449 --> 41:34.616
Give him the amio.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.785
- Do we have any more leads?
- That was our lead.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.871
- Foreman!
- This isn't doing anything.

41:38.997 --> 41:41.957
Foreman, he's in V-fib!

41:48.423 --> 41:51.633
- No good. Hit him again.
- Come on, man. Come on, Joe.

41:52.886 --> 41:54.219
Hit him again!

41:59.017 --> 42:00.767
Give him an amp of epi.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.734
Nothing.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.530
He has multiple system failure.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.578
Foreman!

42:25.501 --> 42:26.919
Foreman.

42:29.297 --> 42:30.714
Foreman!

42:30.840 --> 42:32.633
Time of death?

42:32.759 --> 42:33.967
No!

42:40.850 --> 42:42.726
Time of death...

42:48.107 --> 42:50.025
12:26 p.m.
