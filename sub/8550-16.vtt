MY BEAUTIFUL BONBON!

I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOU TO PESTER ME.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.051
NO SWEAT, MY PET.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.719
I'M HERE TO
PESTER YOUR POP.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.421
WHERE IS HE?

00:20.488 --> 00:22.723
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ALL DAY.

00:22.790 --> 00:26.427
I WAS HOPING I COULD SAY
THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU.

00:26.494 --> 00:27.495

00:30.698 --> 00:32.500
OH, YOU
CRACK ME UP.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.334
NOW, LISTEN...

00:33.401 --> 00:34.868
I COULD USE
SOME ADVICE.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.270
OOH!

00:37.838 --> 00:40.608
NEVER SIT IN
A CHAIR BACKWARDS.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.543
NO, NO, NO.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.579
I'VE DONE SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT UPSET YOUR DAD

00:45.646 --> 00:47.081
JUST A TAD.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.982
YOU DIDN'T BORROW
ANOTHER PAIR

00:49.049 --> 00:51.119
OF HIS BOXER SHORTS,
DID YOU?

00:51.185 --> 00:53.053
NO. MY PARENTS
FINALLY POPPED

00:53.121 --> 00:55.356
FOR A REAL
MOVIE SCREEN.

00:57.057 --> 01:01.962
WHAT I NEED FROM YOU,
IS ADVICE ON HOW TO BREAK
BAD NEWS TO YOUR FATHER.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.497
JUST COME RIGHT OUT
WITH IT.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.933
IT ANNOYS HIM
IF YOU BEAT AROUND THE BUSH.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.535
GOTCHA. NO BUSH BEATING.

01:07.601 --> 01:11.038
UNLESS HE'S
IN A BAD MOOD.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.541
THEN, STEER CLEAR.
MAKE YOURSELF SCARCE.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.808
NO, SIREE.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.644
THAT'S THE
COWARD'S WAY OUT.

01:16.710 --> 01:17.778
I'VE MADE A MISTAKE,

01:17.845 --> 01:21.749
AND I'M GONNA

03:37.050 --> 03:39.219
HEY,
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

03:39.287 --> 03:41.389
I SAT DOWN TO
ADD THESE PICTURES

03:41.455 --> 03:43.457
TO THE FAMILY
PHOTO ALBUM,

03:43.524 --> 03:46.894
AND I STARTED LOOKING
AT THE OLD ONES.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.063
THAT WAS
THREE HOURS AGO.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.865
OOH! LOOK AT
THIS OLD PICTURE.

03:51.932 --> 03:52.733
WHO'S THAT?

03:52.800 --> 03:57.037
THAT'S EITHER
REVEREND SHORE...

03:57.104 --> 03:59.607
OR MY BOOKIE.

03:59.673 --> 04:03.277
THEY BOTH HAD
SHIFTY EYES.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.712
OH, LOOK.

04:04.778 --> 04:08.115
LITTLE CARL TAKES
HIS FIRST STEPS.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.117
YEP. STRAIGHT TO
THE REFRIGERATOR.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.753
OH, STOP IT.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.623
YOU KNOW SOME OF
THESE PHOTOS

04:15.689 --> 04:18.158
GO BACK A LONG,
LONG WAY.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.693
YEAH, I KNOW.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.064
YOU KNOW, I REALIZED TODAY THAT
A LOT OF OUR FAMILY HISTORY

04:24.131 --> 04:25.699
WILL BE LOST
WHEN I DIE.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.969
OH, COME ON NOW, THAT WON'T BE
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.504
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.740
BUT STILL I'D LIKE TO
SIT THE KIDS DOWN,

04:32.806 --> 04:34.742
AND TELL THEM
ABOUT OUR FAMILY.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.777
OH, I THINK
THAT'S A TERRIFIC IDEA.

04:36.844 --> 04:37.678
ME, TOO.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.347
I THINK OUR CHILDREN
SHOULD KNOW

04:39.413 --> 04:41.549
WHERE
THEY COME FROM.

OOH! HEY, LOOK.

RETHINK MY STRATEGY.

OH, LAURA, MY LITTLE
RAY OF SUNSHINE.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.279

06:52.345 --> 06:55.983

AND 2.3 CHILDREN.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.818
MEANWHILE, I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO CARL.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.787
IS HIS MOOD BETTER?
CHEERED UP.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.789
GOODY GUMDROPS.
HE'S HAVING DESSERT.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.824
IT'S RISKY
WHEN HE'S IN A BAD MOOD.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.493
IT'S SUICIDAL
TO INTERRUPT HIM

07:05.559 --> 07:07.895
WHILE HE'S HAVING
CHOCOLATE MILK
AND SMORES.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.163
OH, DEAR.
WELL, SEE YOU LATER.

07:10.230 --> 07:14.234
WAIT, LAURA. YOU ACTUALLY
TOOK TIME TO WARN ME.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.435
SO?

07:15.503 --> 07:17.871
SO YOU LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?

07:20.373 --> 07:21.709
NO.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.151
HELLO, EDWARD.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.420
HOW WAS YOUR STUDY DATE?

07:33.487 --> 07:36.490
TERRIBLE. ALL SHE
WANTED TO DO WAS STUDY.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.527
HISTORY?

07:39.593 --> 07:41.829
YEAH. WE'RE STUDYING
WORLD WAR II.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.030
BORING.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.967
NOT FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO WENT THROUGH IT.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.302
LISTEN, EDWARD...

07:49.369 --> 07:50.738
I'M A LITTLE
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.206
UH-OH.
WHAT DID I DO NOW?

07:53.273 --> 07:55.643
EARLIER TONIGHT GRANDMOTHER
WAS TRYING TO TALK TO YOU

07:55.709 --> 07:58.579
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY HISTORY.
YOU RAN OUT.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.447
MOM, THE OTHER KIDS
DID, TOO.

08:00.514 --> 08:04.518
"MOM, THE OTHER KIDS
DID, TOO."

08:04.585 --> 08:06.053
EDWARD,
YOU'RE THE OLDEST.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.488
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
TRYING TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE.

08:08.556 --> 08:11.992
IF YOU HAD LISTENED
TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER,
THE OTHERS WOULD HAVE.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.828
MOM, THE OTHER KIDS FEEL EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY I DO.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.064
IF WE WANT TO LEARN
SOMETHING ABOUT THE PAST,

08:17.130 --> 08:19.867
WE JUSTWATCH
THE WONDER YEARS.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.848
AAH!
AAH!

08:38.752 --> 08:39.787
STEVE, YOU SCARED ME.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.522
WELL, LOOK
WHO'S TALKING.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.325
GO HOME, STEVE.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.160
NO CAN DO, BIG GUY.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.762
YOU AND I
NEED TO TALK.

08:48.829 --> 08:52.432
OH, ALRIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?

08:52.499 --> 08:55.335
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU BROUGHT HOME
THE BROCHURE

08:55.402 --> 08:57.270
FOR THE PRISON
PEN PAL PROGRAM?

08:57.337 --> 08:59.740
SURE. P.P.P.P.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.843
WELL, IT SEEMED LIKE
A DARN FINE IDEA.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.478
SO I PICKED OUT A NAME
AND STARTED WRITING LETTERS.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.981
GOOD FOR YOU, STEVE.
WHAT NAME DID YOU PICK?

09:08.048 --> 09:11.151
WELL, ONE NAME JUST LEAPED
RIGHT OUT AT ME--

09:11.218 --> 09:13.921
ELMERITA PUCKERWOOD.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.458

LEAP OUT AT ANYBODY.

09:18.525 --> 09:19.793
WELL, AT FIRST,

09:19.860 --> 09:22.229
OUR LETTERS WERE
POLITE AND FRIENDLY,

09:22.295 --> 09:25.465
BUT THEN--
OH, BUT THEN...

09:25.532 --> 09:26.533
THEN?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.937
WELL, ELMERITA'S

09:35.609 --> 09:37.377

09:37.444 --> 09:41.348

THAT ELMERITA
HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ME.

09:47.821 --> 09:51.224
A WOMAN IN PRISON
FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.395
THAT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

09:55.462 --> 09:58.832
YEAH, WELL,
I GUESS IT IS.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.734
YOU KNOW, I WROTE
BACK SEVERAL TIMES,

10:00.801 --> 10:02.936
ASSURING HER
THAT THE FEELING
WASN'T MUTUAL,

10:03.003 --> 10:06.006
BUT SHE JUST THOUGHT
I WAS PLAYING
HARD-TO-GET.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.076
REALLY?
THAT'S HILARIOUS.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.278
NOW HERE'S
THE REALLY
FUNNY PART--

10:11.344 --> 10:15.215
ELMERITA BEGGED ME
TO SEND HER
A PICTURE OF MYSELF.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.086
THAT'S GREAT!

10:19.152 --> 10:21.588
OH, BUT HERE'S
THE FUNNIEST
PART OF ALL--

10:21.655 --> 10:26.459
OH, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS,

WELL,
THAT'S THE FUNNY
PART, BIG GUY.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.956
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT, STEVE.

10:56.023 --> 10:59.827
WELL, I KNOW.
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.762
WELL, THAT'S NO BIGGIE.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.597
AFTER ALL, THE WOMAN
IS IN FEDERAL PRISON.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.533
NO HARM DONE.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.436
WELL...

11:11.138 --> 11:12.505
WELL, WHAT?

11:12.572 --> 11:14.574
SHE MIGHT BE
GETTING OUT SOON.

11:14.641 --> 11:15.743
HOW SOON?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.410
[DOORBELL RINGS]

11:29.757 --> 11:31.391

YOU CAN CALL YOURSELF
WHATEVER YOU WANT,

12:38.859 --> 12:41.862
BUT WHEN THE LIGHTS
GO OUT,

12:41.929 --> 12:43.663
YOUR NAME
IS GOING TO BE...

12:43.730 --> 12:46.199
"OH...BABY."

12:52.973 --> 12:55.775
QUITE A PIECE OF WORK,
ISN'T SHE, BIG GUY?

12:57.644 --> 12:59.212
WELL, WHO ARE YOU?

12:59.279 --> 13:00.380
UH, WELL, UH...

13:00.447 --> 13:05.285
MA'AM,
THERE'S A FASCINATING
STORY ABOUT THAT.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.586
RUN ALONG, SONNY.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.221
NO, HE'S GOING
TO STAY.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.925
STEVE, WOULD YOU
PLEASE TELL
MISS PUCKERWOOD

13:11.992 --> 13:14.027
EXACTLY WHAT IS
GOING ON HERE?

13:14.094 --> 13:15.395
DO IT!

13:19.566 --> 13:20.600
OH...

13:20.667 --> 13:22.235
GO ON.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.473
WELL, YOU SEE, I
WROTE THOSE LETTERS.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.176
I'M STEVEN Q. URKEL.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.945
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
FOR ONE RED-HOT SECOND.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.380
OH, NO, IT'S TRUE.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.316
YOU SEE...YOU SEE...

13:36.383 --> 13:37.550
HE WROTE THE LETTER,

13:37.617 --> 13:39.419
BUT HE SENT YOU
MY PICTURE.

13:39.486 --> 13:44.257
OH! THEN YOU'RE THE ONE
I FELL IN LOVE WITH!

13:47.160 --> 13:51.231
I AIN'T SEEN A MAN
IN SEVEN YEARS.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.535
AND YOU LOOK CLOSE
TO WHAT I REMEMBER!

UH...UH...

14:05.645 --> 14:08.548
ELMERITA...

14:12.285 --> 14:15.455
I'M SORRY, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING THAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN BETWEEN US.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.489
WHAT?

14:16.556 --> 14:18.625
UH, TIME OUT,
TIME OUT.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.494
CARL AND I NEED
TO HAVE A BRIEF
CORNER CAUCUS.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.496
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.134
WELL, WHAT IS IT, STEVE?

14:27.200 --> 14:30.470
CARL, YOU NEED
TO BE REAL CAREFUL

14:30.537 --> 14:32.472
HOW YOU HANDLE
ELMERITA.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.211
WELL, I KNOW THAT.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.081
UH-HUH,
BUT WHAT YOU
DON'T KNOW IS WHY

14:41.148 --> 14:43.283
SHE WAS IN PRISON.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.124
UH, W-W-WELL, WHY?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.626
SHE SHOT A MAN
WHO TURNED HER DOWN.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.897
THOUGHT YOU SHOULD
KNOW THAT.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.809
ELMERITA?

15:09.876 --> 15:11.344
YES?

15:11.411 --> 15:15.415
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE
A STUNNING WOMAN.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.817
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU NOTICED.

15:17.884 --> 15:18.986
YES, YES.

15:19.052 --> 15:22.222
I ALSO NOTICED
WHEN THE LIGHT

15:22.289 --> 15:24.391
HITS YOUR FACE
FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE,

15:24.457 --> 15:27.560
YOU LOOK EXACTLY
LIKE DIANA ROSS.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.332
WHAT KIND OF UNDISCOVERED
ANGLE IS THAT, CARL?

15:35.635 --> 15:36.803
DIANA ROSS, HUH?

15:36.869 --> 15:37.937
UH-HUH.

15:38.005 --> 15:41.408
WELL, TOUCH ME
IN THE MORNING.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.376
WHOO!

15:46.613 --> 15:50.417
GOSH, THERE'S NOTHING
I'D LIKE BETTER.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.653
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M A MARRIED MAN.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.023
YOU ARE?
HAPPILY MARRIED?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.458
OH, YES, VERY HAPPY.
VERY, VERY.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.426
VERY HAPPY.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.728
THEN WHY DID YOU
TURN ON MY OVEN

16:01.794 --> 16:05.598
IF YOU WASN'T
READY TO COOK?

16:05.665 --> 16:08.601
WELL, IT'S ALL
BEEN A TERRIBLE,
TRAGIC MIX-UP.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.436
RIGHT, STEVE?

16:09.502 --> 16:13.106
OH, A TERRIBLE,
TRAGIC MIX-UP.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.808
ELMERITA, I'D LIKE TO HELP
YOU GET A FRESH START.

16:15.875 --> 16:19.212
I KNOW SOME COMPANIES
WHO MAY BE HIRING EX-CONS.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.048
YOU CAN GET ME A JOB?

16:21.114 --> 16:24.384
I CAN TRY.
DO YOU HAVE A PLACE TO STAY?

16:24.451 --> 16:29.922
WELL, NO,
BUT I WAS PLANNING ON
BUNKING UP WITH YOU, BABY.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.592
WELL, I KNOW THERE'S

CLOSE, WE'RE HALFWAY THERE.

16:36.896 --> 16:37.864
BYE, ELMERITA.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.200
HEY, AND DON'T
FORGET TO WRITE.

16:42.001 --> 16:46.239
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO FOOL AROUND?

16:46.306 --> 16:50.410
I'M REAL TEMPTED,
ELMERITA.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.613
BUT I--I JUST
CAN'T DO IT.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.015
OKAY, BUT IT'S YOUR LOSS.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.550
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

16:57.617 --> 17:02.755
I GOT A FULL-BODY TATTOO

17:04.491 --> 17:08.027

STUDYING WORLD WAR II.

HEY, I'M HERE FROM
2:00 TO 3:00 EVERY DAY.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.053
WE'RE GOING
TO LEARN A LITTLE

18:07.120 --> 18:08.855
ABOUT THE ROLE
FIGHTER PILOTS

18:08.921 --> 18:10.757
PLAYED IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.192

YOUR BOOKS,

18:12.259 --> 18:14.427
BECAUSE WE HAVE
A GUEST SPEAKER.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.497
FIRST, A QUESTION.

18:17.564 --> 18:21.234
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE RELATIVES
WHO FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II?

18:21.301 --> 18:24.904
DOES IT MATTER
WHICH SIDE?

18:24.971 --> 18:26.706
NOT REALLY.

18:26.773 --> 18:31.611
GOOD, BECAUSE MY UNCLE
ACCIDENTALLY JOINED
THE ITALIAN ARMY.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.714
EDDIE, HOW ABOUT YOU?
ANY RELATIVES
WHO FOUGHT IN THE WAR?

18:34.781 --> 18:37.550
UM, I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.621
IN THAT CASE, I WANT YOU TO PAY
EXTRA-CLOSE ATTENTION.

HELLO.
HI.

19:04.677 --> 19:08.581
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.484
DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW
WHO THEY WERE?

19:14.120 --> 19:15.455
EDDIE?

19:17.624 --> 19:20.092
UH, UH...

19:20.159 --> 19:22.695
NO.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.232
THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN
WERE BLACK PILOTS

19:25.298 --> 19:27.200
WHO FOUGHT DURING
WORLD WAR II.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.268
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.502
IN THOSE DAYS,

19:29.569 --> 19:31.838
THE ARMED SERVICES
WERE SEGREGATED,

19:31.904 --> 19:34.341
SO THEY HAD TO FORM
THEIR OWN UNIT.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.908

19:42.215 --> 19:45.252
THEY BECAME THE 332nd

SAM WINSLOW

19:49.756 --> 19:50.723

OOH!
OOH!

19:53.092 --> 19:55.795
YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS
A FIGHTER PILOT?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.265
WELL, UH, YEAH.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.933
SURE, BABY.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.935
THERE'S A LOT
OF HIM IN ME.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.839

20:06.906 --> 20:09.008
A SINGLE-ENGINE P-47

20:09.075 --> 20:12.745
HE CALLED
"THE BROWN BOMBSHELL."

20:12.812 --> 20:15.982
OBVIOUSLY HE NAMED IT
AFTER ME.

EXPRESS THEMSELVES.

DURING THE WAR,
THE PILOTS OF THE 332nd

20:28.060 --> 20:31.464
FLEW MORE THAN
15,000 MISSIONS.

20:31.531 --> 20:34.801
200 OF THOSE WERE AS
HEAVY-BOMBER ESCORTS

20:34.867 --> 20:36.769
DEEP INTO GERMANY.

20:36.836 --> 20:41.173
NOT ONE BOMBER WAS LOST
TO ENEMY FIGHTER OPPOSITION.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.312
THEY WERE THE ONLY GROUP
TO HAVE THAT RECORD.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.119
EDDIE, YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
PRETTY COOL.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.555
YEAH, SHE SURE IS.

SEEN HER.

OH, WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M GIFTED.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.476
BUT I WANT YOU TO GIVE
YOUR MOTHER CREDIT, TOO.

21:16.543 --> 21:19.679
IT WAS HER IDEA
THAT I GO TO YOUR CLASS.

21:19.746 --> 21:23.816
HEY, MA, WHY DID YOU WASTE
SUCH A COOL IDEA ON EDDIE?

21:23.883 --> 21:25.818
I LOST MY HEAD.
