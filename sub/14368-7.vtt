{\an8}LOIS:
Uh-huh.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.142
Aha!

00:59.225 --> 01:02.312
Mrs. Foutley, why
can't you just set

01:02.395 --> 01:04.272
a glue trap
or something?

01:04.355 --> 01:05.272
That's Plan B.

01:05.355 --> 01:07.734
But Mom, aren't glue
traps kind of cruel?

01:07.817 --> 01:10.153
That's why it's Plan B.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.696
You might want to nip
this in the bud.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.072
Rats multiply pretty fast.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.951
{\an8}We could already be
talking "army" here.

01:17.035 --> 01:20.371
{\an8}Well, the quickest way
to conquer an army of rats

01:20.455 --> 01:22.081
{\an8}is to first find its leader.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.334
Carl?

01:24.417 --> 01:27.587
There's something living
in our walls.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.672
And I think
it's having a party.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.341
You have exactly
seven seconds

01:31.424 --> 01:34.511
to confess to any involvement,
consequence-free.

01:34.594 --> 01:38.556
{\an8}Mom, I would proudly
lay claim to something
as good as this,

01:38.640 --> 01:41.518
{\an8}but this time I must
sadly declare
my innocence.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.854
{\an8}You didn't bring anything
unusual into this house?

01:44.938 --> 01:48.191
With the exception
of Hoodsey, no.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.401
(<i> rustling in attic</i> )

Hello, friends.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.708
{\an5}Boy, my mom would
really spew soup
if she saw this.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.586
{\an5}Just remind Jo-Jo
that these artifacts
of bondage

02:08.669 --> 02:10.713
will soon set us
on our way to fame.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.506
With a little practice,

02:11.589 --> 02:14.259
we'll become world-class
escape artists

02:14.342 --> 02:15.343
by the time we're 13.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.928
We're talking
franchise.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.556
(<i> manacles squeaking</i> )

02:19.639 --> 02:20.765
Ooh, yeah.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.892
{\an1}I bet tons of prisoners
have worn these

02:22.976 --> 02:23.977
over the years.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.687
{\an1}You can practically see
their sweat stains--

02:25.770 --> 02:27.188
locked in cold,
dark dungeons,

02:27.272 --> 02:32.569
waiting for their grisly date
with the guillotine.

{\an1}Stop, you're
creeping me out.

(<i> phone rings</i> )

02:41.619 --> 02:43.329
Hello.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.582
Oh, hi, Mrs. Bishop.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.000
Um, sure, hang on.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.501
Dod, it's your mom.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.752
Hey, Mom.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.838
We're trapping rats
in Ginger's walls.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.257
{\an1}(<i> voice falters</i> ):
Oh.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.258
All... all right.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.343
{\an1}Yeah, we'll be...
we'll be right home.

(<i> hangs up phone</i> )

02:59.679 --> 03:01.764
You guys, I have to go.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.433
My Nana just died.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.643
Oh, Dodie,
I'm sorry.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.354
Was it sudden?

03:08.438 --> 03:11.357
{\an1}Yeah, during her
tai chi class.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.650
(<i> laughs</i> )

03:12.734 --> 03:14.694
Sorry, nervous reaction.

03:14.777 --> 03:18.656
{\an1}Oh, Dod, uh...
I don't know what to say.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.535
I... I better
get Hoodsey.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.163
I didn't mean to laugh.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.458
{\an1}It just happens whenever
I get too nervous.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.793
(<i> Carl grunting</i> )

03:30.877 --> 03:33.296
Hey, there's
only one key.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.882
We've been cheated, Carl.

03:35.965 --> 03:36.966
Who cares?

03:37.050 --> 03:37.926
By tomorrow morning,
we won't need keys.

03:38.009 --> 03:41.471
Once we've mastered
the escape,

03:41.554 --> 03:43.097
we'll work
on our flare.

03:43.181 --> 03:46.100
Hoodsey, I have
some terrible news.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.936
Nana Bishop
died tonight.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.688
{\an1}Okay, thanks
for letting me know.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.565
We have to practice now.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.943
Hoodsey, our grandmother died.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.320
We have to go home--<i> now.</i>

03:57.403 --> 03:59.864
Fine!

04:01.240 --> 04:02.742
I'm sorry, Hoods.

04:02.825 --> 04:03.910
So am I.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.287
{\an4}This is a total waste
of a perfectly good
Saturday night.

04:06.371 --> 04:10.083
{\an5}Hey, we have
the rest of our lives
to perfect escape.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.419
{\an4}Let me know if you
need to borrow
my black suit.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.629
(<i> door closes</i> )

04:14.712 --> 04:17.464
{\an1}Well, I already feel like
I said the wrong thing.

04:17.548 --> 04:21.260
{\an1}I mean, I have no idea
what Dodie's going through.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.263
{\an1}Don't beat yourself up
over this, Ginger.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.431
Just be a good friend

04:25.515 --> 04:27.475
and be there for her
when she needs you.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.978
Hmm, I think this was
once a loaf a bread.

04:30.061 --> 04:33.272
(<i> shouting</i> ):
Carl, get down here!

04:33.356 --> 04:34.816
Tell me about
Grandma Foutley.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.818
What was she like?

04:36.901 --> 04:39.362
Oh, she was unforgettable.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.196
Really?

04:40.279 --> 04:42.490
Was she eccentric or something?

04:42.573 --> 04:43.866
Oh, Ginge, I hate to say it

04:43.950 --> 04:47.036
but Grandma Foutley and I
didn't exactly see eye-to-eye.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.832
{\an4}In fact, I tried to stay
as far away from her
as I could.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.875
But she loved you kids
something fierce,

04:52.959 --> 04:54.252
{\an1}so I know her heart
was in the right place.

04:54.335 --> 04:59.590
{\an5}You haven't seen
a small key anywhere,
have you?

04:59.674 --> 05:00.383
MRS. BISHOP:
It's so sudden.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.969
Just last month,
she earned a medal

05:03.052 --> 05:05.722
in the Senior Quilting Marathon.

05:06.597 --> 05:07.974
(<i> eating noisily</i> )

05:08.057 --> 05:11.310
{\an1}Yeah, well, the kids
can barely contain their grief.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.061
I... I know.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.396
(<i> phone beeps</i> )

05:13.479 --> 05:15.106
Oh, hang on.

05:16.024 --> 05:21.112
{\an1}Carl Foutley, I am on
a phone call right now.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.280
{\an1}Yes.

05:22.363 --> 05:23.239
{\an1}No.

05:23.322 --> 05:23.906
{\an1}No!

05:23.990 --> 05:25.783
Oh, for heaven's sake!

05:25.867 --> 05:26.909
Robert Joseph,

05:26.993 --> 05:28.703
do you have a key
for Carl Foutley?

05:28.786 --> 05:30.496
Uh-uh.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.082
No, he doesn't
have your key.

05:33.166 --> 05:33.875
{\an1}Good-bye.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.334
Now, where were we?

05:35.418 --> 05:35.793
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

05:35.877 --> 05:38.379
Oh, it doesn't end.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.965
Hi, Mrs. Bishop.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.801
Sorry to hear about
Mrs. Bishop's passing.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.720
The other Mrs. Bishop.

05:45.803 --> 05:46.429
Thank you, girls.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.849
Here, my mom baked
this for you.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.059
It's tuna noodle.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.227
{\an1}She didn't use
cheap tuna, did she?

05:53.311 --> 05:54.729
I'm allergic
to mercury.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.272
I don't think so.

05:56.355 --> 06:00.109
Dodie's up in her room
if you want to go up.

06:00.193 --> 06:00.943
Marge, yeah.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.613
So... so what
were we saying?

06:03.696 --> 06:05.114
Oh, yes.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.741
Yes, it just goes to show you,
you never know.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.868
(<i> eating noisily</i> )

06:08.951 --> 06:11.621
(<i> laughing</i> )

06:12.747 --> 06:13.623
That's a terrific idea.

06:13.706 --> 06:17.418
Robert Joseph would love
to speak at the funeral.

06:17.502 --> 06:22.215
{\an5}DODIE:
These are my first
Pink Pony ponytail holders.

06:22.298 --> 06:25.051
My pigtails were
Nana Bishop's idea.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.427
I never knew that.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.430
I always thought you copied
Bobbie Fry's pigtails.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.807
Mm-mm, Nana Bishop's idea.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.477
{\an4}She used to say,
"Every woman should
have a trademark."

06:34.560 --> 06:36.813
{\an1}Oh, and this is
an ice cream wrapper

06:36.896 --> 06:37.939
from the day in Pine Park

06:38.022 --> 06:40.316
when she karate-chopped
the ice cream man

06:40.399 --> 06:42.110
for cheating me
out of my change.

sweet.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.614

Oh, no.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.203
(<i> crying in distance</i> )

06:52.286 --> 06:53.538
Dodie, I need your opinion.

06:53.621 --> 06:58.376
{\an4}Should we go with
the jungle print
or the powder blue?

06:58.459 --> 06:59.460
(<i> cries</i> )

06:59.544 --> 07:00.920
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

07:01.003 --> 07:03.673
What do you girls think?

07:03.756 --> 07:08.177
{\an1}Whatever you're most
comfortable in, Mr. Bishop.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.345
I vote powder blue.

07:09.428 --> 07:12.765
(<i> sobbing</i> ):
Powder blue it is.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.852
It's for Nana Bishop.

07:15.935 --> 07:16.978
Oh...

07:17.061 --> 07:18.020
Oh.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.566
Oh, and this is from last year's
Flag Day festival.

07:22.817 --> 07:26.195
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>Dodie told us lots of stories</i>
<i>about Nana Bishop.</i>

07:26.279 --> 07:29.031
<i>It must have cheered her up</i>
<i>a lot</i>

07:29.115 --> 07:30.867
<i>because she laughed</i>
<i>a couple of times.</i>

07:30.950 --> 07:33.619

08:12.241 --> 08:12.992
Hi, Dad.

08:13.075 --> 08:13.868
It's me, Ginger.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.828
Remember how you said
I should call you

08:15.912 --> 08:18.998
if I ever wanted to go
for a walk with you and Ben?

08:19.081 --> 08:22.084
Well, I've kind of been thinking
about Grandma a lot

08:22.168 --> 08:26.422
and thought maybe we could take
that walk, if you're free.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.841
I could hold the leash.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.593
Okay?

08:30.676 --> 08:31.928
Call me.

08:35.431 --> 08:38.100
{\an1}Don't you think Gordo's
going to freak out

08:38.183 --> 08:38.851
about those things?

08:38.934 --> 08:40.811
{\an1}I'll just tell her
I lost the key.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.270
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Good one, Carl.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.816
{\an4}Hoods, explain to me
why you're going
to school today.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.109
Your grandmother died.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.403
{\an4}That's only the world's
most perfect
written excuse.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.573
Believe me, spending all day
with Gordo yelling at me

08:52.657 --> 08:54.992
{\an1}is going to be better
than being at my house.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.119
Everyone's all sad

08:57.203 --> 08:59.789
{\an1}and talking about
my grandmother all the time.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.040
It's kind of depressing.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.626
{\an5}Death is supposed
to be depressing,
Hoods.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.586
Yeah, but I'm
not sad, Carl.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.965
{\an1}I don't miss my grandmother
or anything.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.841
I mean, I liked her okay,

09:10.925 --> 09:13.719
but I don't think she
liked me very much.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.471
She'd laugh at me
for no reason.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.056
Nana never laughed
at Dodie.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.934
{\an5}Just don't know how
I'm going to stand
there at the funeral

09:20.017 --> 09:21.519
and talk about her and
pretend I'm sad and all.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.856
{\an1}We really need to perfect
this escape artist act.

09:25.940 --> 09:26.732
(<i> grunts</i> )

09:27.233 --> 09:29.235
It's awfully brave
of you

09:29.318 --> 09:31.028
to dig into your
family history, Ginger.

09:31.112 --> 09:34.365
{\an5}The only time I did,
my dad mentioned
"institution"

09:34.448 --> 09:35.825
and quickly dropped
the subject.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.954
{\an5}So, we are going to
the funeral together
tomorrow, right?

09:40.037 --> 09:42.206
Yeah, my mom's driving.

09:42.290 --> 09:42.999
Oh, good.

09:43.082 --> 09:43.916
You don't suppose

09:44.000 --> 09:46.460
it's one of those open
casket affairs, do you?

09:46.544 --> 09:49.338
{\an1}I never really
thought about it.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.715
Well, you did vote powder blue,

09:50.798 --> 09:52.258
so you must have had
something in mind.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.467
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

09:53.551 --> 09:57.430
{\an5}You've never been
to a funeral before,
have you?

09:57.513 --> 09:59.932
I can't look at dead people.

10:00.016 --> 10:00.975
Oh.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.518
I'm sure Dodie
would understand

10:02.601 --> 10:03.519
if you told her you...

10:03.602 --> 10:05.980
{\an1}No, I'm going to be there
for Dodie.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.274
{\an1}I won't like it,
but I'll be there.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.359
{\an1}That's part of being
a B.F.F.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.278
{\an1}Bye, Ginger--
good luck.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.029
Bye, Mace.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.197
Pick you up at 8:00.

JONAS:
Oh, Ben, down.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.251
Dad!

10:27.335 --> 10:30.171
Sorry, Ben's a little

10:30.254 --> 10:31.756

10:34.884 --> 10:38.387
JONAS:
So, how's school been going?

10:38.471 --> 10:39.555
Okay, I guess.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.181
{\an1}Uh-huh, and...
and Carl?

10:40.264 --> 10:42.850
{\an1}He's not in jail,
is he?

10:42.933 --> 10:44.310
Not yet.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.812
{\an5}Besides, I'm
the jailbird of
the family, remember?

10:46.896 --> 10:47.897
Huh?

10:47.980 --> 10:49.565
Never mind.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.818
{\an5}So, what did you
want to know about
your grandmother?

10:52.902 --> 10:53.944
I don't know.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.905
All sorts of stuff--

10:55.988 --> 10:57.114
stories about her

10:57.198 --> 10:59.241
{\an1}or what we used to do
together when I was little.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.952
Well, you were her
first grandchild,

11:02.036 --> 11:03.329
so she was really crazy in love.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.915
She couldn't get enough of you.

11:05.998 --> 11:06.916
Really?

11:06.999 --> 11:08.751
Oh, yeah.

11:08.834 --> 11:09.919
When you were
a baby,

11:10.002 --> 11:11.837
{\an5}we had a hard time
getting you
to take naps,

11:11.921 --> 11:14.340
{\an5}so Gram would
drive you around
in her car

11:14.423 --> 11:15.091
until you
fell asleep.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.259
She would drive
for hours and hours.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.678
Used to make
your mother so mad.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.389
(<i> laughs</i> )

11:21.472 --> 11:23.599
{\an5}(<i> imitating Lois</i> ):
If you think I'm gonna
drive around

11:23.682 --> 11:26.811
every time she needs a nap,
you're out of your mind.

11:26.894 --> 11:27.937
But Gram didn't care.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.023
She'd keep driving
till she ran out of gas.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.817
{\an1}Maybe that's why
I fall asleep

11:32.900 --> 11:35.111
{\an1}on long car rides
all the time.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.153
Maybe.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.656
I bet she was pretty great.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.908
Made up for the fact
that my real dad

11:40.991 --> 11:42.201
was such
a disappointment.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.120
Must run
in the family.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.371
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:45.454 --> 11:46.789
Ben, no, come back!

11:46.872 --> 11:47.790
{\an1}GINGER:
Hey, Ben!

(<i> barking</i> )

11:48.833 --> 11:49.792
(<i> quacking</i> )

Are you okay?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.880
Yeah.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.590
Thanks, Dad.

Oh!

12:07.560 --> 12:09.687
(<i> grunting</i> )

12:19.405 --> 12:24.493
I thought I lost this stuff
with last year's gutter fiasco.

{\an3}LOIS:
Carl!

12:41.343 --> 12:44.263
{\an1}You opened an all-you-can-eat
squirrel restaurant

12:44.346 --> 12:45.139
in our attic.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.600
I like to think of it
as humanitarian aid.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.976
(<i> groans</i> )

12:49.059 --> 12:52.771
{\an5}There's a long, cold

Whoa, I didn't know
we had home movies.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.240
I'm not surprised.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.327
Your father used to be
quite a home movie fanatic.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.746
(<i> gasps</i> )

13:08.829 --> 13:10.122
Gram.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.542
Yeah, isn't that sweet?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.002
She stole you that day.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.546
What?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.547
Well, borrowed you.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.050
She told me she
was taking you

13:21.133 --> 13:22.343
{\an1}for a drive
around the block.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.720
{\an1}Somewhere between
the driveway and the block,

13:24.803 --> 13:27.389
{\an1}she decided to take you
to the photographer,

13:27.473 --> 13:29.183
{\an1}then on to the shore
to feed seagulls,

13:29.266 --> 13:30.643
which is why you have
that nick on your ear.

13:30.726 --> 13:34.563
{\an4}It wasn't all
that bad a day,
actually.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.981
I ended up getting

13:36.065 --> 13:38.234
{\an1}my one and only nap
in five years.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.402
{\an1}Ha! Get a load
of these.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.112
I think they're
kind of cool.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.989
Oh?

13:44.073 --> 13:46.242
Well, they're yours.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.369
Squirrel problem
solved, Mom.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.912
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.456
Do you mind if I give
one of these to Dodie

13:52.540 --> 13:54.166
for a picture she has?

13:54.250 --> 13:56.335
By all means.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.253
And while you're at it

13:57.336 --> 14:00.548
{\an1}ask if she wants
another little brother, too.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.133
(<i> grunting</i> )

14:07.638 --> 14:09.056
I don't know what to do, Carl;

14:09.139 --> 14:12.601
there's no way I can give
that speech about my Nana.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.354
{\an5}Hoods, why not tell
your parents
the truth?

14:15.437 --> 14:16.105
But it's my Nana, Carl;

14:16.188 --> 14:18.232
{\an1}you're supposed
to like your Nana.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.776
You've been reading
too many greeting cards.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.611
You don't have
to like your family

14:22.695 --> 14:24.321
you just have
to respect them.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.864
And what more respect
can you show

14:25.948 --> 14:28.450
than to speak truthfully
and from the heart?

14:28.534 --> 14:29.702
{\an1}Talk about
"greeting cards."

14:29.785 --> 14:32.621
Then just avoid
the truth altogether:

14:32.705 --> 14:34.456
Just get up there
and tell stories

14:34.540 --> 14:35.541
about you and
your grandmother.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.126
People
eat that stuff up.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.044
If you ask me,

14:39.128 --> 14:40.796
{\an1}this truth stuff
is overrated.

14:40.879 --> 14:41.630
{\an1}I just wish
I could escape

14:41.714 --> 14:44.216
{\an1}this stupid eulogy
altogether.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.595
Hoods, no!

14:53.142 --> 14:53.851
It's time to go.

14:53.934 --> 14:54.643
Now, open this door.

No, I'm not decent!

14:56.812 --> 14:59.356
Well, what on earth
is taking you so long?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.525
I'm, uh, really sad.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.653
I'm still working on my speech.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.030
Why can't I take my bike
and meet you there?

15:06.113 --> 15:10.576
{\an4}JOANN:
Ride your bike
to your grandmother's funeral?

15:10.659 --> 15:11.243
Honestly.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.246
Let the boy ride, JoAnn.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.999
Maybe it's
his way of grieving.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.793
Come, Mother is...

15:21.837 --> 15:23.922
I'm not going to argue today.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.133
Robert Joseph,
you have 20 minutes

15:26.216 --> 15:29.637
to get your tail
down to that funeral home.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.221
Do you hear me?

(<i> horn blows</i> )

15:38.020 --> 15:40.064
(<i> chains rattling</i> )

15:43.275 --> 15:44.777
I thought black
was only appropriate.

15:44.860 --> 15:48.530
{\an1}A thoughtful gesture,
but you do realize

15:48.614 --> 15:51.367
{\an1}that you'll sink
like a rock in those?

15:51.450 --> 15:53.285
{\an1}So, please,
do me a favor

15:53.369 --> 15:55.079
and stay away
from the edge.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.331
Will do.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.918

I think Cleopatra
might have started that trend.

Robert Joseph?

16:12.680 --> 16:15.474
Perhaps you might try
the refreshment table.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.018
Oh... of course.

better be on this boat.

Lead the way.

16:57.015 --> 16:59.393
{\an1}I can't,
I can't, I can't.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.018
It's okay, Macie,

17:00.102 --> 17:03.147
just pretend
she's sleeping.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.648
In pigtails?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.108
Who sleeps in pigtails?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.069
She looks
kind of peaceful.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.571
The dead usually do.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.575
Hey, I think
she just moved.

17:14.657 --> 17:18.203
Oh, sweet mother of maple.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.580
Carl! Heel.

17:26.127 --> 17:30.966
{\an1}JoAnn, Dave,
I'm very sorry for your loss.

17:31.049 --> 17:32.301
Thank you, Lois.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.136
That's very sweet.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.679
{\an1}I should also
apologize

17:35.763 --> 17:37.473
for Carl's ankle wear.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.640
He lost the key.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.184
And to be
perfectly honest,

17:40.267 --> 17:41.477
I'm not looking
that hard.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.394
{\an1}I'd like to extend
my sympathies

17:42.478 --> 17:45.606
on this very somber occasion,
Mr. Bishop.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.316
And to you, as well, Jojo.

you guys.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.659
It really means
a lot to me.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.745

Oh, here, this
is for you.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.458

of weird

{\an1}to give a present
at a funeral and stuff

18:05.793 --> 18:07.002
but it was my grandmother's

18:07.086 --> 18:09.296
and I thought you might
want to put that picture

18:09.379 --> 18:14.718
{\an4}of you and Nana Bishop
someplace where it
wouldn't get bent.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.345
Oh... thanks, Ginger.

My name is Robert Joseph, and
I'm the dead lady's grandson.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.946
My Mom asked me
to talk

18:34.029 --> 18:35.072
about Nana Bishop.

18:35.155 --> 18:38.534
But I'm not sure what to say.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.785
Nana made me nervous...

18:39.868 --> 18:42.037
{\an5}so I avoided her a lot.

Oh, my goodness.

know how to play
boy games.

18:46.708 --> 18:47.376
She liked dolls.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.294
When she and Dodie did
girl stuff

18:49.378 --> 18:51.004
I'd play with her
denture-cleaning tablets,

18:51.088 --> 18:53.215
which make this
really cool blue foam,

18:53.298 --> 18:57.886
and you can use them to pop
the lid off a soda bottle.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.847
Nana thought it was funny
when I ate one,

18:59.930 --> 19:02.432
but it wasn't;
it tasted nasty.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.310
Nana used to tell me
that I should try new things

19:05.394 --> 19:08.897
like when she took me
to the <i> Nutcracker</i> ballet.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.900
I don't know
what she was getting at.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.736
It was just a bunch of people
jumping around

19:14.820 --> 19:16.321
with no words or pants
or anything.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.117
Though the battle with the giant
rats was kind of cool.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.745
(<i> people murmuring</i>
<i>and exclaiming</i> )

19:23.829 --> 19:27.791
She used to make me eat
rum-raisin ice cream, too,

19:27.875 --> 19:29.877
but she'd let Dodie
have chocolate.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.504
Nana said that every man
in the Bishop family

19:32.588 --> 19:37.593
has to learn to like rum-raisin,
even though raisins are gross.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.888
Guess it's like some kind
of family tradition

19:40.971 --> 19:43.098
like Dodie's pigtails.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.184
I guess that stuff doesn't seem
so dumb now.

19:46.268 --> 19:50.772
Maybe Nana was just trying
to share junk with Dodie and me

19:50.856 --> 19:52.316
so that we'd remember her better

19:52.399 --> 19:55.193
after she went to that great,
big bingo hall in the sky.

19:55.277 --> 19:59.990
I know I'll never look
at blue foam or a raisin

20:00.073 --> 20:03.118
and not remember how Nana
used to laugh at me

20:03.201 --> 20:03.952
and pinch my cheek really hard.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.664
(<i> motorboat engine revving</i> )

20:07.748 --> 20:09.249
(<i> people gasping</i> )

20:09.333 --> 20:10.292
(<i> glass shatters</i> )

20:10.375 --> 20:12.628
MR. BISHOP:
Mother!

20:17.799 --> 20:23.972
(<i> someone crying softly</i> )

20:24.056 --> 20:25.223
Good night,
sweet Ernestine

20:25.307 --> 20:29.853
{\an1}and may flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.607
(<i> crying continuing</i> )

20:33.690 --> 20:35.984
Oh, Mother!

20:36.068 --> 20:39.738
{\an4}David Charles Bishop,
get out of that grave
this instant.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.698
{\an1}You're upsetting
the children.

20:41.782 --> 20:42.991
Hey, I want to try!

20:43.075 --> 20:44.034
JOANN:
Robert Joseph!

20:44.117 --> 20:48.914
(<i> movie projector humming</i> )

20:48.997 --> 20:49.998
(<i> Ginger laughs</i> )

20:50.082 --> 20:51.500
GINGER:
Mom, what are you wearing?

20:51.583 --> 20:55.337
Let's just say that was my
desperately-seeking-Lois phase.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.674
HOODSEY:
No offense, Mrs. Foutley,

20:58.757 --> 21:01.009
but you don't even look
like a mom there.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.886
LOIS:
No offense taken, Hoodsey.

21:02.970 --> 21:03.887
There's your Grandma Foutley.

21:03.971 --> 21:07.307
She made that costume for you.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.520
Oh, look at Carl.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.729
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

21:12.813 --> 21:14.648
Nice diaper, Carl.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.733
Hard to imagine there
was ever a time

21:16.817 --> 21:18.610
when you didn't get
into trouble.

21:18.694 --> 21:21.989
I'm sure they were
very dull days.

21:26.159 --> 21:26.868
Hey!

21:26.952 --> 21:27.953
That certainly
explains a lot.

21:28.036 --> 21:31.540
They have social workers
for those kinds of problems.

21:40.298 --> 21:42.217
Well... ready boys?

21:42.300 --> 21:44.219
Right behind you, Lola.

21:44.594 --> 21:47.681
Uh, Mom.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.481
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>Hoodsey's eulogy made me think</i>
<i>a lot about my family,</i>

21:56.565 --> 22:01.319
<i>about how sometimes your family</i>
<i>can make you really mad</i>

22:01.403 --> 22:04.948
<i>or feel bad and make it hard to</i>
<i>see the good things about them.</i>

22:05.032 --> 22:08.493
<i>But then one day, they're gone</i>

22:08.577 --> 22:10.746
<i>and all you have left</i>
<i>are the memories.</i>

22:10.829 --> 22:13.290
<i>Then you see all those</i>
<i>good things in a new light</i>

22:13.373 --> 22:16.877
<i>and you wish that you</i>
<i>had pointed them out</i>

22:16.960 --> 22:20.547
<i>a little more often</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

22:27.846 --> 22:28.680
Dad?

22:28.764 --> 22:29.639
I'm glad I got you.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.725
It's Ginger.

22:31.808 --> 22:32.309
(<i> giggles</i> )

22:32.392 --> 22:35.687
No, Carl's not in trouble.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.607
(<i> loud whooshing</i> )

22:38.690 --> 22:39.775
Now hold still.

22:39.858 --> 22:44.529
{\an1}It's been a long time
since I worked this baby.
