WEBVTT

00:02.605 --> 00:04.772
Thanks for letting me
put Halley in your room.

00:04.774 --> 00:06.107
Yeah, no problem.

00:06.109 --> 00:08.509
Oh, and, Penny, she kinda
threw up on your stuffed bear.

00:08.511 --> 00:09.644
Oh, that's okay.

00:09.646 --> 00:11.846
Hey. Tha-That's an
Ewok and it's mine.

00:11.848 --> 00:14.482
Yeah, which is why
it's okay.

00:16.152 --> 00:18.452
See, he gets Ewoks
in his bed.

00:18.454 --> 00:20.655
You've got Chewbacca;
that's enough.

00:21.391 --> 00:22.690
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I used to have

00:22.692 --> 00:24.926
the stuffed raccoon
from <i>Guardians of the Galaxy,</i>

00:24.928 --> 00:27.795
but Cinnamon licked it raw.

00:29.532 --> 00:32.800
There's a time and place
for your randy dog stories,

00:32.802 --> 00:36.204
and... it's never and nowhere.

00:37.106 --> 00:38.506
Yeah, no more stories about sex,

00:38.508 --> 00:40.808
so, Amy, that brings us to you.

00:40.810 --> 00:43.244
Well, at work
we've been doing

00:43.246 --> 00:44.846
some interesting research
with neuroprosthetics.

00:44.848 --> 00:45.880
PENNY:
Neat.

00:45.882 --> 00:47.515
I've been rewatching <i>The O.C.,</i>

00:47.517 --> 00:50.151
so we're all leading
productive lives.

00:50.153 --> 00:53.354
We've been working
on a computer interface

00:53.356 --> 00:56.023
that can use brain wave patterns
to control robotic limbs,

00:56.025 --> 00:57.491
but we're having a little
trouble localizing

00:57.493 --> 00:59.093
the signal from the EEG cap.

00:59.095 --> 01:01.863
Oh, well, have you thought about
adding a phased array of sensors

01:01.865 --> 01:03.164
for better localization?

01:03.166 --> 01:05.800
Actually, that never
occurred to me.

01:05.802 --> 01:07.034
It never occurred to me

01:07.036 --> 01:11.239
I would miss
the Ewok conversation.

01:11.241 --> 01:14.242
Good, 'cause I just bought
another one on Amazon.

01:15.712 --> 01:18.412
You know, I could use
an engineer on this project.

01:18.414 --> 01:19.914
Well, now, this
works out great.

01:19.916 --> 01:21.015
Howard's an engineer.

01:21.017 --> 01:23.951
I'm sure he knows
someone qualified.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.254
She was talking about me,
Sheldon.

01:26.256 --> 01:28.222
I'm perfectly qualified.

01:28.224 --> 01:29.857
Yeah, Howie's the world's
best engineer.

01:29.859 --> 01:32.093
It says so right
on his coffee mug.

01:33.196 --> 01:34.729
Aw, you got him a mug?

01:34.731 --> 01:36.831
I did.

01:36.833 --> 01:39.400
But it's not a competition.

01:39.402 --> 01:42.470
Yeah, I lost that
battle years ago.

01:43.973 --> 01:45.239
So, Howard, are you interested?

01:45.241 --> 01:46.574
Are you kidding?

01:46.576 --> 01:48.743
If I could control robot arms
with my brain,

01:48.745 --> 01:50.678
I'd be able to do
so many things.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.880
Really? Because you've been
controlling human arms

01:52.882 --> 01:55.716
with your brain for years
and not much has come of it.

02:26.621 --> 02:28.154
Hey, what you reading?

02:28.156 --> 02:29.489
A parenting book.

02:29.491 --> 02:31.558
Oh, my God.
Are-are we...?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.827
Wha... No!

02:33.829 --> 02:36.896
You think this is how
I would tell you?

02:37.733 --> 02:38.732
Well... (stammers)

02:38.734 --> 02:40.166
You're sitting there
with a book.

02:40.168 --> 02:43.269
It felt like
anything was possible.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.107
Bernadette left it here.

02:47.109 --> 02:48.108
Yeah?

02:48.110 --> 02:49.976
Anything interesting?

02:49.978 --> 02:51.845
Well, I just saw a picture
of a baby's head crowning,

02:51.847 --> 02:54.547
so I hope you enjoyed sex,
because we're done with that.

02:56.184 --> 02:57.317
Hello.

02:57.319 --> 02:58.885
- Hi.
- Hey, Sheldon, what's up?

02:58.887 --> 03:01.020
Well, remember
how disappointed you were

03:01.022 --> 03:03.056
when Amy started
driving me to work?

03:03.058 --> 03:05.859
Sure, uh...

03:05.861 --> 03:09.796
Sometimes people smile
a big smile of disappointment.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.331
Yeah, well, good news,

03:11.333 --> 03:13.733
Amy had to go in early
to show Howard around her lab,

03:13.735 --> 03:15.435
so you get to drive me.

03:15.437 --> 03:18.304
Aw, his smile of disappointment

03:18.306 --> 03:20.573
has turned into a frown of joy.

03:21.476 --> 03:23.510
It's fine,
I've been driving him for years.

03:23.512 --> 03:24.744
What's one more day?

03:24.746 --> 03:26.246
Oh, and I've got a new car game
we can play.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.814
It's called “what siren am I?”

03:27.816 --> 03:29.215
Kill me.

03:31.620 --> 03:34.020
Amy, your lab is amazing.

03:34.022 --> 03:35.955
A C-arm fluoroscope,

03:35.957 --> 03:38.658
a cranial ultrasound...

03:38.660 --> 03:39.626
(gasps)

03:39.628 --> 03:42.328
And look at that
coffee maker.

03:42.330 --> 03:44.431
I know.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.299
On our expense report,

03:46.301 --> 03:49.969
I listed it as “Eduardo,”
my Colombian lab assistant.

03:50.739 --> 03:53.907
So this is it?
Yes.

03:53.909 --> 03:55.909
We are using it to map
brain wave patterns

03:55.911 --> 03:57.644
and then converting them
into electrical impulses

03:57.646 --> 03:59.078
that can be used
to control anything

03:59.080 --> 04:00.413
from wheelchairs to robots.

04:00.415 --> 04:01.848
Based on that ring
on your finger,

04:01.850 --> 04:04.184
I'd say you're pretty
good at controlling robots.

04:04.186 --> 04:07.253
Careful, that's my fiancé
you're talking about,

04:07.255 --> 04:09.923
and I can program
him to hurt you.

04:12.427 --> 04:15.195
(imitates melodic siren wailing)

04:21.336 --> 04:24.404
I don't know.
Uh... French police?

04:24.406 --> 04:26.973
Oh. So close.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.541
Belgian ambulance.

04:30.111 --> 04:31.544
All right,
you ready for your next one?

04:31.546 --> 04:33.313
Just a warning,
this one's a little annoying.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.414
(imitates high-pitched siren)

04:34.416 --> 04:37.116
Let's take a little...
little break,

04:37.118 --> 04:38.284
I'm getting a headache.

04:38.286 --> 04:42.589
Aw, right in the middle
of our fun game.

04:42.591 --> 04:45.158
Yeah, weird.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.259
So...

04:46.261 --> 04:48.261
Howard and Amy
working together...

04:48.263 --> 04:49.295
that's interesting, huh?

04:49.297 --> 04:51.531
Eh. It's all right,
I suppose.

04:51.533 --> 04:54.267
Uh, when... usually when Amy
complains about her coworkers,

04:54.269 --> 04:55.435
I just tune her out,

04:55.437 --> 04:58.137
but now I'll be able
to join in and pound away.

04:59.541 --> 05:01.541
You're not jealous
of Howard, are you?

05:01.543 --> 05:03.309
Of course not.

05:03.311 --> 05:05.278
The only engineer
I'm jealous of

05:05.280 --> 05:07.313
is the one who blows
the train whistle.

05:07.315 --> 05:09.148
Ooh, that just gave me
an idea for a new game,

05:09.150 --> 05:12.886
“what whistle am I?”
Train.

05:14.422 --> 05:16.723
For your information,
it was going to be tea kettle,

05:16.725 --> 05:18.758
but the tea kettle
was on a train,

05:18.760 --> 05:21.728
so I'll give it to you.

05:22.898 --> 05:25.832
If we add phase detection
to your EEG sensors,

05:25.834 --> 05:27.367
I'll have to rewrite
most of the code.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.068
Can you do that?
Well, these hands

05:29.070 --> 05:30.637
were made to do three things:

05:30.639 --> 05:32.171
close-up magic, writing code,

05:32.173 --> 05:33.306
and the dirty shadow puppet show

05:33.308 --> 05:35.341
that got me kicked
out of Hebrew school.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.745
Hello.

05:38.747 --> 05:41.314
Hi. What a nice surprise.

05:41.316 --> 05:43.716
Well, I just came by to see how
you two were getting along.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.618
(laughs) Well, everything's
going really great.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.787
Oh, that's nice to hear.

05:49.257 --> 05:52.025
I was hoping you two
would enjoy working together.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.360
What's with the blinking?

05:54.362 --> 05:57.564
(quietly):
It's Morse code.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.533
So we can talk about...

06:02.737 --> 06:05.772
...without hurting...
's feelings.

06:07.342 --> 06:09.809
Sheldon, I don't know
Morse code.

06:09.811 --> 06:11.578
I do. And if you have
something to say,

06:11.580 --> 06:12.579
you can say it to my face.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.014
Oh. All right.

06:23.658 --> 06:27.594
I'm a little rusty.
Could you say that again?

06:29.000 --> 06:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:36.738 --> 06:41.007
She's going to be home at
“eight-ish.” Like, when is that?

06:41.009 --> 06:42.208
8:01? 8:02?

06:42.210 --> 06:45.578
And what kind of scientist
uses “-ish”?

06:45.580 --> 06:46.679
I'll give it a go.

06:46.681 --> 06:49.415
My ride home with you
was hellish.

06:50.652 --> 06:52.986
Sheldon, honey, if you want
to join us for dinner,

06:52.988 --> 06:54.253
you're more than welcome.

06:54.255 --> 06:55.421
No, thank you.
I don't think

06:55.423 --> 06:57.090
I'd be very good company
tonight.

06:57.092 --> 06:59.592
Well, then out you go.

07:00.829 --> 07:02.729
Okay, what is going on?

07:02.731 --> 07:04.263
Well, ever since Amy started
working with Howard,

07:04.265 --> 07:05.498
she hasn't been home.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.267
Didn't that
just start this morning?

07:08.269 --> 07:10.436
And has she been home?

07:11.439 --> 07:13.306
You know,
that would frustrate me.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.975
Does it frustrate you?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.210
I-It does.

07:17.212 --> 07:18.311
I get that.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.613
You know, it's okay
to feel frustrated

07:20.615 --> 07:22.215
when things aren't
going your way.

07:22.217 --> 07:24.350
I suppose.

07:24.352 --> 07:26.119
Ah, maybe it's not
that big a deal.

07:26.121 --> 07:27.854
PENNY: No, no, no,
your feelings

07:27.856 --> 07:28.788
are valid.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.156
Now, why don't
you go wash up,

07:30.158 --> 07:33.126
and we'll call you
when dinner's ready.

07:36.598 --> 07:38.498
Okay.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.768
(door closes)

07:41.770 --> 07:43.970
What did you do--
Are you a witch?

07:43.972 --> 07:46.606
No, I've been reading
Bernadette's parenting book.

07:46.608 --> 07:49.108
It's like the answer key
to the Sheldon test.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.278
That's amazing.
I know.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.547
But, you know,
it's only birth to five.

07:54.549 --> 07:56.916
What do we do when he turns six?

07:56.918 --> 08:00.386
Take him to the zoo
and leave him there.

08:02.624 --> 08:04.590
Hey, Bernadette.

08:04.592 --> 08:05.725
Oh, hey, Raj.

08:05.727 --> 08:07.593
Howard's not here.
Oh, I know,

08:07.595 --> 08:10.163
he's been in the lab every night
this week with his work wife.

08:10.165 --> 08:11.964
That's weird,

08:11.966 --> 08:14.333
I thought his work wife
was standing in my kitchen.

08:15.603 --> 08:16.536
Don't be snippy.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.438
I came to see
how you were doing.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.406
Like, uh, do you need help
with anything?

08:20.408 --> 08:22.308
Oh, thank you.

08:22.310 --> 08:23.876
There are a few things
around the house

08:23.878 --> 08:25.244
that I've been waiting
for Howard to get to.

08:25.246 --> 08:26.279
The smoke alarms...

08:26.281 --> 08:28.414
No, I meant emotionally.

08:28.917 --> 08:30.850
How are you feeling?

08:30.852 --> 08:33.785
Like you're not really here
to help me.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.356
Well, still snippy.

08:37.357 --> 08:39.424
Everything's fine.

08:39.427 --> 08:41.327
Howard's really excited
about his work,

08:41.328 --> 08:43.830
he's been in a great mood...
I'm really proud of him.

08:43.832 --> 08:47.033
And I can fit into the pants
I wore in high school.

08:47.035 --> 08:49.602
Come on, we don't need
to lie to each other.

08:49.604 --> 08:51.671
You're right.

08:51.673 --> 08:53.372
I have a teething baby,
I'm pregnant,

08:53.374 --> 08:54.774
I have a proposal due tomorrow.

08:54.776 --> 08:55.875
I don't have time to hear about

08:55.877 --> 08:57.443
how much you're missing
my husband.

08:57.445 --> 09:01.914
Well, I think I know why
he's been working so late.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.752
Hi.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.053
Welcome home.

09:07.055 --> 09:08.221
How was work?

09:08.223 --> 09:10.490
Great.
Howard had an idea for...

09:10.492 --> 09:12.291
That's enough about work.

09:13.194 --> 09:14.694
Aw, you just got here.

09:14.696 --> 09:16.763
You need to sit down
and let me pamper you.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.732
(laughs): Oh.
Well, that sounds nice.

09:19.734 --> 09:22.902
I got you a little something
to help you relax.

09:22.904 --> 09:25.972
Sheldon, that is the sweetest,
most...

09:27.976 --> 09:29.876
What... what is this?

09:29.878 --> 09:32.411
The notes from our
quantum cognition project.

09:32.413 --> 09:33.613
I thought we could

09:33.615 --> 09:37.483
spend the evening
grinding away on it.

09:37.485 --> 09:40.620
(sighs) I just got
home, I'm tired.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.622
Of Howard, I know.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.956
So how about you and me

09:43.958 --> 09:47.193
make some beautiful
science together?

09:48.930 --> 09:52.932
Sheldon, I want to work on this
with you, just not tonight.

09:52.934 --> 09:55.635
What if we get up early and do
it in the morning? I promise,

09:55.637 --> 09:58.738
I'll be way more into it.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.039
You know what?

10:00.041 --> 10:01.741
There was a time that
you would've been happy

10:01.743 --> 10:04.076
to stay up and collaborate
all night with me.

10:04.078 --> 10:07.647
And then wake up in the morning
and do it some more.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.249
(sighs) Fine, but can
we make it quick?

10:10.251 --> 10:11.717
No.

10:11.719 --> 10:13.886
If you're just gonna make me
do all the work, then go to bed.

10:13.888 --> 10:15.755
But don't be surprised
if you walk out here

10:15.757 --> 10:17.390
and catch me doing it myself.

10:28.426 --> 10:31.617
Ahh, Sheldon's texting me
to drive him to Bernadette's.

10:31.618 --> 10:32.817
Well, what are you gonna say?

10:32.819 --> 10:34.852
Well, they did just introduce
the middle finger emoji.

10:34.854 --> 10:37.288
If it's not for this,
I don't know what it's for.

10:37.290 --> 10:39.390
No, no, no.
He'll just think that means

10:39.392 --> 10:41.025
“Be there in a minute.”

10:41.027 --> 10:42.360
Uh...

10:42.362 --> 10:44.729
Maybe there's something
in the book that will help.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.130
Worth a shot.

10:46.132 --> 10:48.466
Okay. Let's see, let's see.

10:48.468 --> 10:50.768
“Biting other children”?

10:50.770 --> 10:54.172
Well, sometimes, but...
problem for another day.

10:54.703 --> 10:56.035
Okay, wait, wait.
Here we go.

10:56.037 --> 10:57.770
“Let him have ownership
of his choices.

10:57.772 --> 11:01.040
Allow him to choose from options
that are acceptable to you.”

11:01.042 --> 11:03.243
All right, I'll give it a try.

11:03.245 --> 11:07.847
“I can drive you in two hours
or you can take an Uber”"

11:07.849 --> 11:10.216
Good. See, now he feels
like he has a choice.

11:10.218 --> 11:11.985
Huh.
(phone chimes)

11:11.987 --> 11:15.088
He's gonna take an Uber.

11:15.090 --> 11:18.358
Wow, it worked.

11:18.360 --> 11:22.262
Unless he bites
the driver, yeah.

11:23.431 --> 11:25.798
And now they're working
on a Saturday?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.100
Can you believe them?

11:27.102 --> 11:29.102
Like, is this how you
envisioned your weekend?

11:29.104 --> 11:32.205
No, it is not.

11:32.207 --> 11:34.274
This whole thing is maddening.

11:34.276 --> 11:35.942
I'm really busy.

11:35.944 --> 11:38.278
I don't have time to
listen to you complain.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.547
Hey. You're complaining, too.

11:40.549 --> 11:42.015
“Sheldon, why are you here?”

11:42.017 --> 11:46.252
“Sheldon, the applesauce
is for the baby.”

11:46.254 --> 11:47.654
What do you want?

11:47.656 --> 11:51.324
I just wish I could make Howard
feel as angry as I'm feeling.

11:52.727 --> 11:55.662
Well, maybe you could do
something he likes

11:55.664 --> 11:57.196
and make him jealous.

11:57.198 --> 11:58.831
Like what?

11:58.833 --> 12:00.633
Have you ever read <i>Tom Sawyer?</i>

12:00.635 --> 12:01.734
No.

12:01.736 --> 12:04.037
Chores. He likes chores.

12:05.407 --> 12:07.707
Ooh. What kind of chores?

12:07.709 --> 12:08.975
Well,

12:08.977 --> 12:12.011
you could change the batteries
in the smoke detectors.

12:12.013 --> 12:14.714
That would drive him crazy.

12:14.716 --> 12:16.549
That's great.

12:16.551 --> 12:19.352
Oh, he'll be so mad smoke
will be coming out of his ears.

12:19.354 --> 12:22.622
And then the smoke detectors
will detect it.

12:23.358 --> 12:24.457
Wait, wait, now, hold on.

12:24.459 --> 12:26.392
Why'd you ask me
about <i>Tom Sawyer?</i>

12:26.394 --> 12:28.895
I'm just interested in you.

12:28.897 --> 12:33.132
Well, you are sweeter
than your applesauce.

12:35.904 --> 12:37.637
Okay, I'm gonna extend
the wait time and have it poll

12:37.639 --> 12:39.305
the A-to-D converter
at the top of the loop

12:39.307 --> 12:40.406
instead of the bottom.

12:40.408 --> 12:41.774
Oh. That's impressive.

12:41.776 --> 12:44.877
You think that's impressive,
take apart that brain model.

12:47.248 --> 12:48.348
(gasps)

12:48.350 --> 12:49.649
Oh my God-- three of clubs.

12:49.651 --> 12:51.250
That was my card!

12:51.252 --> 12:52.819
How did you...?

12:53.955 --> 12:55.622
I used to make it
appear in my pants,

12:55.624 --> 12:58.524
but HR said I had
to stop doing that.

13:00.528 --> 13:02.695
So, how much longer
till we can test it?

13:02.697 --> 13:05.832
Well, it needs to compile,
so it's gonna be a few minutes.

13:05.834 --> 13:08.735
Sounds like we've earned
ourselves a break.

13:08.737 --> 13:10.937
You want to hear
some Neil Sedaka?

13:10.939 --> 13:13.673
You know, that's your
greatest magic trick,

13:13.675 --> 13:15.908
'cause you just read my mind.

13:17.345 --> 13:21.314
♪ I love, I love,
I love my calendar girl ♪

13:21.316 --> 13:25.284
♪ Yeah, sweet calendar girl ♪

13:25.286 --> 13:29.122
♪ I love, I love,
I love my calendar girl ♪

13:29.124 --> 13:31.457
♪ Each and every day
of the year ♪

13:31.459 --> 13:33.960
♪ <i>January</i> ♪

13:33.962 --> 13:37.630
♪ You start the year all fine... ♪
Well, well, well.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.099
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:40.101 --> 13:43.469
You say you're busy as bees,
yet here you are, dancing.

13:43.471 --> 13:45.772
Although I suppose
bees do dance,

13:45.774 --> 13:48.207
but their dance lets other bees
know where the pollen is,

13:48.209 --> 13:49.509
and yours does not.

13:49.511 --> 13:53.980
So my logic, despite
that slight detour, does track.

13:54.883 --> 13:57.417
We're just waiting
for my code to compile.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.985
What are you doing here?
I stopped by

13:58.987 --> 14:01.220
to see if you wanted
to go to the movies with me.

14:01.222 --> 14:02.822
Well, I-I'd love to,

14:02.824 --> 14:05.358
but we're just about
to test the interface.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.426
It could take a while.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.695
Okay, buddy, it--
it's not my place,

14:08.697 --> 14:11.898
but Bernadette's been
feeling a little abandoned

14:11.900 --> 14:13.866
with all the hours that
you've been putting in.

14:13.868 --> 14:16.169
You just asked him
to go to the movies.

14:16.171 --> 14:17.770
Yeah, but our weird
relationship was grandfathered

14:17.772 --> 14:21.107
into their marriage,
and yours was not.

14:23.178 --> 14:26.979
Okay, I put new batteries
in the smoke detectors.

14:26.981 --> 14:28.514
Did you do the laundry?

14:28.516 --> 14:29.982
I sure did. Ooh.

14:29.984 --> 14:32.485
He's gonna be steamed.

14:32.487 --> 14:34.754
Just like his dress shirts.

14:35.690 --> 14:37.590
At least he can still
clean the oven,

14:37.592 --> 14:38.825
so that's something.

14:38.827 --> 14:40.626
Oh, that's what he thinks.
Where's your steel wool?

14:40.628 --> 14:42.729
Right here.

14:42.731 --> 14:45.031
We make quite the team.

14:45.033 --> 14:47.200
Sure do.

14:48.069 --> 14:49.969
Guys, you won't believe this.

14:49.971 --> 14:52.939
I stopped by the university
to check in on Howard and Amy,

14:52.941 --> 14:54.373
and they were having fun.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.142
Well, don't worry.
He won't be having any fun

14:56.144 --> 14:57.310
when he gets home.

14:57.312 --> 14:59.112
I did all his favorite chores.

15:00.181 --> 15:01.514
What are you talking about?

15:01.516 --> 15:03.483
Howard hates doing chores.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.651
Wait, then why would Bernadette
tell me that... (gasps)

15:05.653 --> 15:07.854
Bernadette.

15:09.758 --> 15:11.791
Did you play on my well
established gullibility

15:11.793 --> 15:13.226
to clean your house?

15:13.228 --> 15:15.862
Sure did.

15:15.864 --> 15:18.564
Well, I would storm out of here,

15:18.566 --> 15:20.733
but I already have
the gloves and the steel wool,

15:20.735 --> 15:24.070
and I really do love
cleaning an oven. Move.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.140
She made me do all her chores,

15:27.142 --> 15:29.008
and it wasn't even her
idea-- she stole it

15:29.010 --> 15:31.577
from <i>Tom Sawyer.</i>

15:31.579 --> 15:33.212
You know what? This is crazy.

15:33.214 --> 15:35.882
Howard and Amy are working
together-- get over it.

15:35.884 --> 15:36.916
Leonard, what are you doing?

15:36.918 --> 15:38.084
“Knowing when to say when.”

15:38.086 --> 15:39.418
This is not a big deal.

15:39.420 --> 15:40.853
It <i>is</i> a big deal.

15:40.855 --> 15:43.823
Howard's getting Amy used to
laughing and listening to music.

15:43.825 --> 15:46.592
What if she expects
that madness at home?

15:46.594 --> 15:48.327
Yeah, that is a good point.
I'm really proud of the way

15:48.329 --> 15:49.796
you're able to express
your feelings.

15:49.798 --> 15:50.930
SHELDON:
Thank you.

15:50.932 --> 15:52.131
I'm just so angry.

15:52.133 --> 15:53.199
You know,

15:53.201 --> 15:54.534
everyone gets angry.

15:54.536 --> 15:58.237
Even mommies and daddies.

15:59.641 --> 16:01.174
You can't think
this is the right time

16:01.176 --> 16:02.875
to “validate his behavior.”

16:02.877 --> 16:05.278
Okay, what about
“presenting a united front”?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.246
What about you coddling him
and he's never gonna learn?

16:07.248 --> 16:08.548
Look.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.151
You sound frustrated,
and I'm really proud of the way

16:12.153 --> 16:15.221
you're able to state
your opinion.

16:15.223 --> 16:16.956
Thank you.

16:16.958 --> 16:18.624
Wait, no, no.

16:19.627 --> 16:21.394
Don't use that book on me.

16:21.396 --> 16:22.495
SHELDON:
W-Wait,

16:22.497 --> 16:23.496
what book?

16:23.498 --> 16:24.664
(groans) Penny's been using

16:24.666 --> 16:26.666
one of Bernadette's
parenting books on you.

16:26.668 --> 16:28.367
What? So has he.

16:28.369 --> 16:31.537
Wh-What makes you think
you can treat me like a child?

16:34.576 --> 16:38.611
Your shampoo comes
in a Big Bird bottle.

16:38.613 --> 16:41.147
That's because the adult shampoo
burns my man eyes.

16:45.186 --> 16:47.320
Hey, what are you working on?

16:47.322 --> 16:49.655
Oh, my God, you're still here?

16:51.860 --> 16:52.925
Well, of course I'm here.

16:52.927 --> 16:55.127
I know what
you're going through.

16:55.129 --> 16:58.965
Really? You have a needy
Indian man in your house?

16:59.968 --> 17:02.235
I did,
but then he came over here.

17:04.105 --> 17:06.137
So is this how it's gonna be
if we have kids?

17:06.140 --> 17:07.772
You're just gonna
throw me under the bus?

17:07.775 --> 17:10.041
If you spoil them the way you do
Sheldon, then, yeah.

17:10.044 --> 17:11.344
Uh, my way was working.

17:11.346 --> 17:12.578
Okay? I think you're just upset

17:12.579 --> 17:14.914
because there are some things
I am better than you at.

17:14.915 --> 17:16.616
Well, you can't end a sentence
with a preposition,

17:16.617 --> 17:18.084
so clearly, not grammar.

17:19.354 --> 17:21.621
If you're so smart,
was that a smart thing to say?

17:21.623 --> 17:22.755
That depends. Before I said it,

17:22.757 --> 17:24.223
was sex tonight
still on the table?

17:24.224 --> 17:25.925
No.
Then it's fine.

17:28.096 --> 17:30.563
You know, once we get this
operational,

17:30.565 --> 17:33.165
we could probably figure out
how to make it wireless.

17:33.167 --> 17:35.167
That'd be amazing.

17:35.169 --> 17:36.369
(phone chimes)

17:36.371 --> 17:38.671
Oh, that's Sheldon.

17:38.673 --> 17:40.773
Oh, he's upset with
Leonard and Penny.

17:40.775 --> 17:42.308
(phone whooshes)

17:42.310 --> 17:43.676
And Bernadette.

17:43.678 --> 17:45.144
(phone whooshes)

17:45.146 --> 17:46.512
And Mark Twain.

17:49.684 --> 17:51.517
Yeah, Bernadette
texted earlier.

17:51.519 --> 17:53.819
Raj is really getting
on her nerves.

17:53.821 --> 17:55.855
Well, I guess we have
been working late a lot.

17:55.857 --> 17:56.956
(sighs)

17:56.958 --> 17:58.791
Should we call it a
night and go home?

17:58.793 --> 18:01.894
Or we could brew a pot
of coffee and power through.

18:01.896 --> 18:04.563
I don't know,
it's getting kind of late.

18:04.565 --> 18:06.732
Hey, where's my watch?

18:06.734 --> 18:07.867
Why don't you ask

18:07.869 --> 18:09.502
your skeleton?

18:11.906 --> 18:13.839
(Amy gasps)

18:13.841 --> 18:15.675
Oh, my God.

18:15.677 --> 18:18.044
How is that even possible?!

18:26.483 --> 18:28.992
This is great,
the two of us hanging out.

18:28.994 --> 18:30.327
Why didn't we think
of this earlier?

18:30.329 --> 18:31.428
Agreed.

18:31.430 --> 18:33.230
I don't need Amy
to watch a movie.

18:33.232 --> 18:36.032
I can not hold your
hand just as easily.

18:36.034 --> 18:38.235
(music begins playing over TV)

18:40.772 --> 18:45.475
In the book this is based
on, that man's the killer.
