40:22.688 --> 40:24.456
What would that look like?

40:24.490 --> 40:25.724
You lose your license?

40:25.757 --> 40:27.593
They kick you out?

40:27.626 --> 40:30.128
No, I'd still be a doctor,
but I'd be compromised.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.963
No one would hire me.

40:31.997 --> 40:35.567
You add the kiddie porn to that,
and all bets are off.

40:35.601 --> 40:38.403
This guy is out
to crush me.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.772
He's out to show you
he can crush you.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.073
There's a difference.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.609
He could have you whacked,

40:43.642 --> 40:45.443
but he's trying to scare you
instead.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.513
That says something.

40:47.546 --> 40:51.149
My guess --
You're scaring him.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.450
How?

40:52.484 --> 40:54.052
That's what you need
to find out.

40:57.055 --> 40:59.124
Know what your enemy
is afraid of.

41:00.559 --> 41:01.893
That's power.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.097
You know, we, uh --

41:06.131 --> 41:08.767
You know,
we talked about this once,

41:08.800 --> 41:11.937
how I could...

41:11.970 --> 41:13.639
hire it done.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.608
I'm not talking about
killing anyone.

41:16.642 --> 41:19.444
Just taking him down.

41:19.477 --> 41:22.781
Going through channels.

41:22.814 --> 41:26.618
Yeah.
Weak, but doable.

41:26.652 --> 41:27.953
Right place and time,

41:27.986 --> 41:30.789
grab his computer,
download files.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.791
Might give you something.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.192
You could also fuck with him
a little.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.727
Give him a time bomb.

41:35.761 --> 41:38.630
I...I don't want
to get into that.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.498
This is not a game.

41:40.532 --> 41:44.536
The question is not
"Is it a game?"

41:44.570 --> 41:48.707
The question is
"Who sets the rules?"

42:00.719 --> 42:02.220
Who's the feeder?

42:02.253 --> 42:05.090
I'll take that to mean
you're ready to talk numbers.

42:05.123 --> 42:08.126
**

42:10.562 --> 42:13.565
**

42:40.592 --> 42:43.595
