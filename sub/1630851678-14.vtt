00:58.726 --> 01:00.628
Welcome to Hollywood.
Wow!

01:00.661 --> 01:02.796
Impressive, right, HP?

01:02.830 --> 01:07.468
Why, it's almost as if
your world actually
respects actors.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.036
Respects them? Ha!

01:09.069 --> 01:12.606
Around here
people worship actors
as gods.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.278
If only that were me.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.480
I know my acting career
didn't really pan out,

01:19.513 --> 01:22.383
but maybe
I'd have a shot
in this world.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.386
Possibly.
But Mr. X is after us,
and he's seen you,

01:25.419 --> 01:27.121
so we need to keep
a low profile.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.922
He's gone.
He's what?

01:28.956 --> 01:31.159
Hollywood,
here I come!

01:33.161 --> 01:35.829
You know what?
I do not have the energy
for this.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.831
Hey!

01:41.202 --> 01:42.503
Ooh.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.971
Ah!

01:44.004 --> 01:46.073
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.608
Ah, don't worry about it.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.178
Happens a lot at these
old fogy auditions.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.480
What?
Auditions?

01:52.513 --> 01:54.815
Are you all actors?

01:54.848 --> 01:56.350
Guilty as charged.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.319
Still waiting
for my big break,
though.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.754
Humphrey Westwood,
nice to meet ya.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.089
You an actor too?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.792
Oh, it's only my
singular passion.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.360
I'm Hopediah Plantar.

02:06.394 --> 02:09.663
Say, I thought I knew
all the senior male actors
around here.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.098
You from out of town?

02:11.131 --> 02:14.368
Yep, way out of town.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.205
What, like Sacramento,
or--

02:17.238 --> 02:19.173
Okay, are you
Humphrey Westwood?

02:20.174 --> 02:21.475
Me? No.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.110
Why? Do we look alike?

02:23.143 --> 02:26.113
Hopediah,
you should audition.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.148
Go ahead.
Take my spot
in line.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.150
Oh, no, no.
I couldn't.

02:30.184 --> 02:33.053
Nonsense.
This town can be
harsh on newcomers.

02:33.086 --> 02:36.156
So consider this
a welcome to Hollywood
from me to you.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.091
Well, if you insist.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.761
Whoa!

02:42.763 --> 02:44.398
All right.
I'll set the scene
for ya.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.666
You got this
elbow cream, right?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.301
You put it on.
You feel like brand new.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.936
You're so surprised,
you say...

02:50.338 --> 02:53.140
Ooh! Wow! Great!

02:53.173 --> 02:55.976
Hmm, no.
Not feeling it.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.213
Such a shame too
because everything else
about you is literally perfect.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.014
Say what?

03:05.353 --> 03:08.656
That is
the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.360
Everyone, we've got
a new catchphrase.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.195
Huh? Ooh.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.299
Yep, can't see a thing.

03:19.099 --> 03:22.303
Hollywood?
More like Pollywood!

03:23.036 --> 03:24.272
Hmm?
There's Hop Pop.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.607
And it looks like
he didn't even
cause any trouble.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.210
Hop Pop? Whoa, sorry.
You look just like
someone I know.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.946
All right, this guy
got the part.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.250
Everyone else can go home.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.451
What the--
Wow!

03:37.485 --> 03:38.786
Way to go, HP.
Whoa!

03:38.819 --> 03:40.087
Are you kidding?

03:40.120 --> 03:43.491
Hey!
Congratulations,
Hopediah.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.426
Humphrey, wait.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.595
I just realized,
I took your spot.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.264
Heck,
I might've just stolen
your opportunity.

03:50.298 --> 03:53.867
Ah, pishposh.
It was one in a mil
either way.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.537
I'm just happy it went
to a nice guy.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.607
Plus,
I've already waited
45 years for a break.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.409
What's a few more?

04:01.442 --> 04:03.444
Forty-five years?

04:03.477 --> 04:05.413
I know the feeling,
Humphrey.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.048
I still don't think
this is a good idea.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.618
But as long as it's
for something small
that no one sees,

04:10.651 --> 04:11.919
maybe it'll
be harmless.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.325
<i>Do your elbows crack
when you bend them?</i>

04:19.793 --> 04:21.729
<i>Try Cracka-Lackin' elbow cream.</i>

04:21.762 --> 04:23.464
Hop Pop!

04:23.497 --> 04:24.565
Whoa!

04:24.598 --> 04:25.966
<i>But wait, there's more.</i>

04:25.999 --> 04:27.735
<i>Say what?</i>
Say what?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.169
Whoa, Hop Pop!

04:29.202 --> 04:30.504
You're on TV!

04:30.538 --> 04:32.906
How did I get inside
the picture box?

04:32.940 --> 04:35.743
And why am I saying lines
from that play
I did yesterday?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.978
Bad news, guys.
It's on every channel.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.113
Hop Pop,
that wasn't a play.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.282
They were filming you
for a commercial.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.751
You lost me,
Anne.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.786
This is not low profile.

04:45.819 --> 04:49.189
Oh! Do we live with
somebody famous?

04:49.222 --> 04:52.660
Should we be
charging rent?

04:52.693 --> 04:55.128
What if Mr. X
sees one of these?

04:55.162 --> 04:58.265
Who?
Um, the secret agent
who wants to catch us.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.635
Anne, he's a busy
federal employee.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.837
I'm sure he
doesn't have time
for TV.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.109
Just because I'm
a federal employee

05:09.142 --> 05:12.480
doesn't mean I can't enjoy
the odd episode of <i>Judge Julie.</i>

05:14.848 --> 05:19.620
<i>Dry? Crusty?
Now you don't have to be.</i>

05:19.653 --> 05:21.188
<i>Say what?</i>

05:28.095 --> 05:32.099
And they said
I was a fool to not pay
for ad-free streaming.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.969
I still think
this is overkill.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.305
Sorry, but we need
to get the commercials pulled

05:38.338 --> 05:40.641
before this gets
out of contr--
Holy crud!

05:40.674 --> 05:42.342
[Sprig, Polly] Whoa!

05:45.345 --> 05:47.047
Awesome!

05:47.080 --> 05:48.749
Cool.
Terrible.

05:48.782 --> 05:52.152
I can't believe all it took
was getting trapped
in another world

05:52.185 --> 05:53.721
to get my big break.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.222
But am I deserving?

05:55.255 --> 05:57.925
Am I living a dream
that should've gone
to Humphrey?

05:57.958 --> 06:00.293
Am I-- On a T-shirt?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.865
Ooh!

06:05.933 --> 06:07.768
Whoa!
They have mugs too!

06:07.801 --> 06:09.870
You have a catchphrase?

06:09.903 --> 06:12.339
This would actually
be pretty neat
if it weren't so--

06:13.474 --> 06:15.609
Hello?
Hi. This is
Mitch Harbor,

06:15.643 --> 06:17.177
calling for
Hopediah Plantar.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.447
Wait, Mitch Harbor?
The Mitch Harbor?

06:19.480 --> 06:21.949
Director of--
<i>Fumagator I, II,</i>
and <i>IV?</i>

06:21.982 --> 06:23.851
Yep.
Now could I please
speak to--

06:23.884 --> 06:25.285
Hopediah Plantar.

06:25.318 --> 06:28.188
It's me. I'm Hopediah.
Not anyone else. Only me.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.390
HP, I love your work!

06:30.424 --> 06:32.860
I want you
to audition for a role
in my latest film.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.795
Say what?

06:36.129 --> 06:37.364
Did you hear that?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.232
It sounded like
that guy in the commercial.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.901
Whoa,
is it really him?

06:43.837 --> 06:47.475
Meet you at 10:00 a.m.
at your office
in the studio water tower?

06:47.508 --> 06:49.777
Just show up
and I get the part?

06:49.810 --> 06:51.144
Whoa!

06:53.180 --> 06:55.215
Hop Pop, don't even
think about--

06:55.248 --> 06:57.951
I'm sorry, Anne.
This is too big
to pass up.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.787
No, Hop Pop!
Get back here!

06:59.820 --> 07:01.622
Hey!
Don't push, man!

07:04.492 --> 07:06.560
Jenny, he's headed
for the studio lot.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.928
Meet me with reinforcements.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.931
We got him
for real this time.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.100
We've got to get to Hop Pop
before Mr. X does.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.134
Come on.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.622
Wha-- Mm-hmm.

07:42.496 --> 07:43.931
Oh, no! Hop Pop!

07:43.964 --> 07:45.599
Who the heck
are you people?

07:45.633 --> 07:47.134
No questions,
Earth man!

08:00.080 --> 08:02.015
All right.
Cue the pyrotechnics.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.818
Hey, this is actually
pretty realistic.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.590
Holy smokes!

08:20.534 --> 08:23.136
Wait! <i>Suspicion Island</i>
is not real?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.272
Doy!
Don't be
so gullible, dude.

08:29.677 --> 08:30.844
<i>Primthistle Manor!</i>

08:30.878 --> 08:32.145
Lord Frankerton.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.380
And Lady Franklin!

08:33.413 --> 08:35.382
What do y'all
think you're doing?

08:35.415 --> 08:37.050
This here's
a closed set.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.819
Wait, your accent
isn't real?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.253
Who's gullible now,
Anne?

08:55.569 --> 08:57.104
This is it, Hopediah.

08:57.137 --> 09:01.108
After today, you'll be
the biggest frog actor
who ever lived!

09:01.141 --> 09:04.411
Ooh! Oh, I'm so sorry!
I didn't see you there.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.545
Humphrey?

09:05.579 --> 09:08.682
Looks like you found out
my day job, Hopediah.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.950
Where are you off to?

09:09.983 --> 09:14.387
Oh, me? I, uh,
have an audition up there.

09:14.421 --> 09:19.126
With Mitch?
Bravo, my friend, bravo.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.628
Golly, what a break.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.429
I'm so happy for you.

09:22.462 --> 09:27.735
Even if I never make it,
it's enough to know an old fart
like me did.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.604
Now get up there!
Mitch is waiting for you!

09:34.474 --> 09:37.945
No, Humphrey.
He is waitin' for you.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.880
Huh?
What are you talking about?

09:39.913 --> 09:43.717
It's only
because of your kindness
that I even had this chance.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.386
And it's high time
I return the favor.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.121
All right, Mr. Plantar,

09:48.155 --> 09:50.791
after hearing you read
those pages,
I'm gonna have to say...

09:50.824 --> 09:52.660
you got the dang part!

09:54.427 --> 09:55.829
There he is! Get him!

09:59.099 --> 10:00.734
No!
They got Hop Pop!

10:00.768 --> 10:02.870
You kids sure about that?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.139
Wait.
Then who did they catch?

10:08.041 --> 10:09.843
Thought you could escape me,
huh?

10:12.713 --> 10:16.416
Ow! Let go of my nose!
Wait, it's-it's not
a false nose? But--

10:16.449 --> 10:21.288
I don't believe this.
You dare treat Hollywood's
newest star this way?

10:21.321 --> 10:24.357
You'll be hearing from
my robust team of lawyers
after this.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.360
No. It can't be!
Not again!

10:27.394 --> 10:30.831
All right, stand down.
Mr. X was wrong again.

10:38.038 --> 10:42.342
Jenny,
I'm gonna need some ice cream,
girl. A lot of ice cream.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.346
I don't get it.
You abandoned the audition?

10:46.379 --> 10:51.551
I didn't abandon it.
I just gave it to someone
who's waited as long as I have.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.322
Thank you.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.292
I've already had a taste
of the spotlight, kids.

10:59.326 --> 11:03.831
It's time for this old frog
to stop pining after
what he doesn't have

11:03.864 --> 11:07.167
and start seriously protecting
the things he does.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.804
Bravo, Hop Pop. Bravo.

11:10.838 --> 11:15.809
Besides, this whole experience
has taught me that the real
power is behind the camera.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.477
Wait. You don't mean--

11:17.510 --> 11:20.914
That's right, Anne!
From now on,
I wanna be a director.
