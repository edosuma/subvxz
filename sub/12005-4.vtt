You should clean this up if
you're gonna have company over.

00:04.304 --> 00:05.504
We should have gotten our stories straight.

00:05.538 --> 00:07.306
- Regina Vasquez?
- Yeah.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.341
Come with me, please. Unfortunately
these kinds of red flags

00:09.375 --> 00:12.478
require me to refer your case to
our fraud investigation department.

00:12.512 --> 00:15.447
- This is for you.
- It's a letter from Frida Kahlo to Diego.

00:15.482 --> 00:18.102
They don't even sell these.
Most of them are in museums.

00:18.103 --> 00:18.842
Are you sure it's real?

00:18.843 --> 00:21.129

00:21.130 --> 00:23.781

00:23.782 --> 00:25.288
_

00:25.291 --> 00:27.059
No turning back now.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.460
So that's how you wanna win this thing?

00:28.495 --> 00:30.462
By saying nothing of substance?

00:30.497 --> 00:34.399
I'm sorry, but I think Ivan is
right. No more talking politics.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.469
Then consider your wife reined in.

00:39.038 --> 00:41.106
- Thanks.
- No problem.

00:42.408 --> 00:44.309
- Girl or boy?
- A girl.

00:44.344 --> 00:47.179
Oh, exciting.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.014
So crazy me, I thought maybe

00:49.048 --> 00:51.950
you wanted to know that you
had another one on the way.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.018
You just gonna walk out on another kid?

00:53.052 --> 00:55.954
- This is not the same.
- It is to the kid.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.223
It is the same thing all over again.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.095
- Did he say anything to you?
- I don't know.

01:03.129 --> 01:05.230
- It must be a mistake.
- He didn't say anything?

01:05.265 --> 01:07.132
No, nothing.

01:10.169 --> 01:12.771
Hey, can I talk to you
guys about something?

01:12.805 --> 01:15.741
That's funny. We were about
to ask you the same question.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.743
What the hell is this?

01:17.777 --> 01:19.077
It's a credit card bill.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.746
That is correct...

01:20.780 --> 01:24.049
with a $400 prenatal ultrasound charge.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.984
Oh, yeah.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.719
Is there something you need to tell us?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.688
I thought Nikki was a good Christian girl.

01:29.722 --> 01:31.056
Not that Christian.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.025
It's not Nikki's.

01:33.059 --> 01:35.027
Oh, Toby.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.763
No no no no, I didn't get anybody pregnant.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.631
The ultrasound was for Lana.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.100
- Wait, how did you even...
- Angelo's Lana.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.670
I ran into her at the mechanic's,

01:44.704 --> 01:47.639
and I gave her a ride home and that's
when I got into that fender bender.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.575
So I took her to the E.R.
to make sure she was okay.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.743
Whoa, wait a sec. So I'm now paying

01:51.778 --> 01:54.646
for prenatal care for Angelo's floozy?

01:54.681 --> 01:55.981
Dad, she's not a floozy.

01:56.015 --> 01:59.585
Whatever you think about
Angelo, it's not her fault.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.520
<i>- It's half her fault.
- (Sighs)</i>

02:01.554 --> 02:03.722
Lana's family's in Boston. She's all alone.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.524
She seemed like she needed some help.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.426
What am I supposed to do?
Just look the other way?

02:07.460 --> 02:09.627
- Toby, this is Angelo's problem.
- (Scoffs)

02:09.662 --> 02:13.532
Honestly, I thought you guys would
be way more supportive about this.

02:13.646 --> 02:15.881
I really think you guys should meet her.

02:15.915 --> 02:17.582
Why?

02:17.617 --> 02:21.420
Because she's carrying Bay's sister.

02:21.454 --> 02:23.689
- Look, we appreciate you wanting to help...
- Good,

02:23.723 --> 02:25.590
because I invited her to dinner.

02:43.810 --> 02:47.779
Bay, wait. Can we please talk about this?

02:47.814 --> 02:50.449
- We did and you lied.
- I know. I'm sorry.

02:50.483 --> 02:52.484
Wow, you should just
get that on a t-shirt.

02:52.518 --> 02:53.819
- It would really move things along.
- Bay.

02:53.853 --> 02:56.888
Why is Angelo's settlement
money parked in my driveway?

02:56.923 --> 02:59.825
I don't know. I think he's trying
to patch things up with Bay.

02:59.859 --> 03:02.327
Huh.

03:02.361 --> 03:05.530
Ooh, doesn't look like it's
going very well for Angelo.

03:05.565 --> 03:09.434
Oh, I wish Daphne were here.
She could read their lips.

03:09.469 --> 03:11.636
<i>- Kathryn: There goes a finger in the face.
- Oh, boy.</i>

03:11.671 --> 03:14.339
He strikes out!

03:14.373 --> 03:17.709
(Sighs) It's nice not to be at
the receiving end of one of those.

03:17.744 --> 03:20.445
So if Bay is done with Angelo,

03:20.480 --> 03:21.747
can we be, too?

exactly do pottery anymore,

04:22.642 --> 04:24.876
so I thought I would find
this thing a good home.

04:24.911 --> 04:28.680
The memory of an ugly father's
day mug is flashing back.

04:28.714 --> 04:31.616
Well, maybe it's time you
graduated to lopsided pots.

04:31.651 --> 04:33.752
(Laughs)

04:33.786 --> 04:36.454
Hey, what are you guys
doing tomorrow night?

04:36.489 --> 04:38.890
- Why?
- Good, that means you're free.

04:38.925 --> 04:42.694
I accidentally ran into Lana again.

04:42.728 --> 04:45.764
And judging by your looks,
I'm just gonna get right to it.

04:45.798 --> 04:47.933
She's coming to dinner tomorrow night.

04:49.602 --> 04:51.736
Well, thanks for letting me know

04:51.771 --> 04:53.738
so I have time to make other plans.

04:56.976 --> 04:59.678
And I will be using an
excuse to be named later.

04:59.712 --> 05:02.781
Oh, come on, she really wants
to meet her baby's big sister.

05:05.551 --> 05:07.786
Lana wants to meet me?

05:07.820 --> 05:10.789
- Bay wants to meet me?
- Of course she does.

05:10.823 --> 05:12.924
You know, this really isn't the best time.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.826
We can do it anytime you want.

05:14.861 --> 05:17.929
Okay, actually, that was just
my polite way of saying "no."

05:17.964 --> 05:20.866
If nothing else, come for the
food. My mom is an amazing cook.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.969
- Your mom's gonna be there?
- And my dad.

05:24.003 --> 05:27.672
Yeah, I'm sorry. I have to pass.

05:27.707 --> 05:30.642
Aren't you even a little
curious to meet Bay?

05:30.676 --> 05:32.777

05:42.588 --> 05:43.955
What's wrong?

05:43.990 --> 05:47.859
Travis's parents are kicking him out.

05:47.894 --> 05:51.830
And I think that we should
talk to John and Kathryn, but...

05:51.864 --> 05:54.900
But Travis doesn't want you to.

05:54.934 --> 05:57.002
Been down that road.

05:57.036 --> 06:00.639
But you know him better than I do.

06:00.673 --> 06:03.575
Is this like a "don't tell your dad,

06:03.609 --> 06:05.710
but secretly I want you

06:05.745 --> 06:07.812
to tell your dad"?

06:07.847 --> 06:10.515
Or is it just a "don't tell your dad"?

06:10.549 --> 06:13.518
I don't know.

06:13.552 --> 06:16.554
But they'd let him stay here, right?

06:16.589 --> 06:19.591
Apparently, even those
carrying Angelo's spawn

06:19.625 --> 06:20.859
are welcome.

06:20.893 --> 06:23.662
Right, the dinner. I
feel bad you have to go.

06:23.696 --> 06:26.531
Bad enough to join me?

06:26.565 --> 06:28.466
No way.

06:29.735 --> 06:32.437
My baby back ribs always go fast.

06:32.471 --> 06:34.472
And I'll serve salad with dinner.

06:34.507 --> 06:36.474
That'll shave 20 minutes off the night.

06:36.509 --> 06:40.378
How come Daphne and Regina get to
boycott and we get stuck hosting?

06:40.413 --> 06:42.347
Just be grateful Angelo's not coming.

06:42.381 --> 06:46.284
He's the cause of all
this. He gets to skip, too?

06:46.319 --> 06:49.421
(Sighs) Toby says that
Lana is still not sure

06:49.455 --> 06:52.424
- how Angelo fits in.
- At least we have that in common.

06:52.458 --> 06:54.693
All right, I am off to the market.

06:54.727 --> 06:57.295
- What do you want for dinner tonight?
- That reminds me...

06:57.330 --> 06:58.630
set a place for Ivan. He's popping by later

06:58.664 --> 07:01.232
to discuss internal polling data.

07:01.267 --> 07:03.435
Oh, well, then I'll stay out of your way.

07:03.469 --> 07:06.237
You know where the
takeout menus are, right?

07:13.546 --> 07:16.114
- Excuse me.
- If you have a problem with the ticket,

07:16.148 --> 07:18.383
you have to take it up with the city.

07:18.417 --> 07:21.419
I'm Daphne. I go to school with Travis.

07:21.454 --> 07:24.222
Oh, right. The one that can talk.

07:24.256 --> 07:26.491
Yeah.

07:26.525 --> 07:30.462
- Did you know that he's been...
- What's he done this time?

07:30.496 --> 07:33.198
- Uh...
- What's he done?

07:33.232 --> 07:37.102
Nothing. I just want you to
know how great your son is.

07:37.136 --> 07:39.137
Oh, okay.

07:41.007 --> 07:44.242
You know, Carlton offers free A.S.L.
classes to parents on Thursday nights.

07:44.276 --> 07:47.912
Oh, right. I'm gonna fit
that in right after work...

07:47.947 --> 07:50.115
before I have to go take care of my mom,

07:50.149 --> 07:52.117
who can't even get out of bed.

07:52.151 --> 07:54.285
And then I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna make dinner,

07:54.320 --> 07:56.221
clean up the house...

07:56.255 --> 07:58.823
none of which Travis helps me with.

07:58.858 --> 08:02.761
And you're kicking him
out of the house for that?

08:02.795 --> 08:04.896
Is that what he told you?

08:04.930 --> 08:07.098
It's not true?

08:07.133 --> 08:09.067
Did he tell you about the
fights he's been getting into

08:09.101 --> 08:11.803
with his brother and his dad?

08:13.172 --> 08:16.775
Yeah, I bet he didn't.

08:16.809 --> 08:19.677
He's the one that's
threatening to move out.

08:19.712 --> 08:22.647
And honestly... (Sighs)

08:22.681 --> 08:24.049
maybe it's just for the best.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.788
<i>(Knock on door)</i>

08:31.712 --> 08:33.679
I've been thinking about this.
And that woman is coming here.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.682
She is coming to this house.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.450
I know.

08:37.485 --> 08:40.419
Well, that's ridiculous. You're
gonna just let that happen?

08:40.453 --> 08:42.455
<i>- Not my house.
- He makes these messes,</i>

08:42.490 --> 08:44.491
and then he expects all
of us to clean it up.

08:44.525 --> 08:47.460
And I am so sorry that I got
you involved in any of this.

08:47.495 --> 08:50.597
Honey, I knew him years
before you were even born.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.299
You married him for me,

08:52.333 --> 08:54.467
and I feel so terrible about that.

08:54.502 --> 08:56.603
That is not your fault.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.139
I have no regrets.

08:59.173 --> 09:01.508
Okay, if I could get in a
time machine and go back,

09:01.542 --> 09:03.310
I probably wouldn't marry him again.

09:03.344 --> 09:06.346
- But I did...
- We should warn her.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.481
- Who?
- Lana.

09:08.516 --> 09:11.451
We should tell her what
she's getting into with him.

09:11.485 --> 09:14.187
I don't think you should get involved.

09:14.222 --> 09:15.455
I'm going to that dinner,

09:15.489 --> 09:19.125
and I'm going to tell her exactly
what kind of guy Angelo is.

09:24.874 --> 09:26.841
<i>- (Knock on door)
- Come in!</i>

09:28.844 --> 09:30.578
Smells good. What are you making?

09:30.613 --> 09:32.681
Old family recipe.

09:32.715 --> 09:34.783
Pop-tarts.

09:34.817 --> 09:37.819
If you're here to talk me into coming
to your party for Angelo's baby mama,

09:37.853 --> 09:39.421
the answer is "no."

09:39.455 --> 09:41.556
No, that's not why I'm here.

09:41.590 --> 09:43.425
But we're not happy about it, either.

09:43.459 --> 09:46.695
John and I only said yes to this dinner
'cause we figured that you'd kill it.

09:46.729 --> 09:49.631
- We need to work on our good cop/bad cop.
- (Chuckles)

09:49.665 --> 09:51.299
So what's up?

09:51.334 --> 09:55.270
I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to get out of here,

09:55.304 --> 09:56.705
go have some fun.

09:56.739 --> 10:00.375
Would this involve heels?

10:00.409 --> 10:02.277
Could.

10:10.453 --> 10:13.521
So you have a Frida Kahlo
letter and you want to sell it?

10:13.556 --> 10:16.624
If it's actually worth
anything. My dad gave it to me.

10:16.659 --> 10:19.160
I'm sure it's a fake.

10:19.195 --> 10:21.429
I have a bunch of mumbo jumbo

10:21.464 --> 10:23.231
from the auction house,

10:23.265 --> 10:26.234
and it probably means more
to you than it does to me.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.239
(Laughs)

10:31.273 --> 10:33.475
This was one of Frida's
unsent letters about Leonardo.

10:33.509 --> 10:36.544
- Uh, who's Leonardo?
- Her son.

10:36.579 --> 10:39.214
I thought that after the bus accident

10:39.248 --> 10:41.516
- she couldn't have any children.
- She couldn't,

10:41.550 --> 10:44.419
so she created an imaginary
son she called Leonardo.

10:44.453 --> 10:47.422
Really? I've never read anything.

10:47.456 --> 10:50.091
Oh, yeah. She made paintings
for him and wrote letters about

10:50.126 --> 10:52.961
- the life she wanted them to have together.
- That's so sad.

10:52.995 --> 10:55.263
She burned all the letters,

10:55.297 --> 10:57.198
but I guess somehow this one survived.

10:57.233 --> 11:01.002
Are you sure you want to part with this?

11:04.140 --> 11:06.107
- (Jazz music playing)
- (Chattering)

11:08.144 --> 11:10.879
Oh. I love this place.

11:10.913 --> 11:13.248
I used to come here all
the time with Angelo,

11:13.282 --> 11:15.049
way back in the day.

11:19.255 --> 11:21.823
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

11:21.857 --> 11:23.191
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yes.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.160
- Club soda with lime, please.
- Sure.

11:25.194 --> 11:27.162
- Make that two.
- Okay.

11:27.196 --> 11:30.999
Oh, uh... Kathryn, I'm
fine. Order what you want.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.667
It is what I want.

11:33.803 --> 11:36.771
Okay, I'll take a pink panty-dropper.

11:36.806 --> 11:39.107
- All right.
- (Laughs)

11:39.141 --> 11:41.810
Vodka, beer, pink lemonade.

11:41.844 --> 11:43.077
- Oh. I'm guessing...
- (Chuckles)

11:43.112 --> 11:45.780
You needed to get out of
the house more than I did.

11:45.815 --> 11:47.715
Ugh! John's campaign.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.751
What? I thought you'd be a natural.

11:49.785 --> 11:52.921
Apparently not. I have "too many opinions."

11:52.955 --> 11:54.823
- Oh.
- I'm supposed to smile

11:54.857 --> 11:56.724
and be the happy homemaker.

11:56.759 --> 12:00.462
It should be easy. I've
had plenty of practice.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.667
Oh my God.

12:05.701 --> 12:09.637
- What?
- Zane.

12:09.672 --> 12:10.772
When I used to come here,

12:10.806 --> 12:13.675
he always used to hit
on me in front of Angelo.

12:13.709 --> 12:17.545
It was kind of nice to have
the shoe be on the other foot.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.380
<i>He's gorgeous.</i>

12:19.415 --> 12:22.383
He reminds me of a guy I dated in college.

12:22.418 --> 12:23.585
He was a musician?

12:23.619 --> 12:26.321
- No.
- Oh.

12:26.355 --> 12:29.691
- Why are you so surprised?
- Well, I guess...

12:29.725 --> 12:32.360
You're right. I shouldn't be.

12:32.394 --> 12:34.395
His name was Chester. He flew airplanes.

12:34.430 --> 12:36.731
One time he took me to D.C. for dinner

12:36.765 --> 12:38.633
- in a little five-seater.
- Oh.

12:38.667 --> 12:41.436
I've been in one of those. I was terrified.

12:41.470 --> 12:45.406
Not me. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

12:45.441 --> 12:47.275
Um...

12:47.309 --> 12:50.512
how did your mom take you dating Chester?

12:52.314 --> 12:54.649
- I never told her.
- (Chuckles)

12:54.683 --> 12:57.185
You should go over there and talk to him.

12:57.219 --> 12:58.520
Oh, please. I doubt he even remembers me.

12:58.554 --> 13:00.488
Really?

13:02.157 --> 13:04.225
He's coming over here right now.

13:06.195 --> 13:08.363
<i>- Reggie?
- Regina: Hi.</i>

13:08.397 --> 13:11.132
- Is that you?
- Yeah, wow.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.534
What's it been, 15 years?

13:12.568 --> 13:15.470
Yeah, you don't look like it.

13:15.504 --> 13:19.140
Kathryn, this is Zane. Zane, Kathryn.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.309
- Kathryn, very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.212
So you and Angelo still together?

13:24.246 --> 13:26.347
No.

13:26.382 --> 13:28.349
Hmm.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.253
I think I'm gonna go powder my nose.

13:33.389 --> 13:34.989
Excuse me.

13:36.025 --> 13:38.293
- May I?
- Please.

13:40.396 --> 13:43.231
I thought I heard that
you moved to New York.

13:43.265 --> 13:47.201
Wait. Didn't I hear that
you played Lincoln Center?

13:47.236 --> 13:49.003
This is true.

13:49.038 --> 13:51.973
That's incredible. What
are you doing back here?

13:52.007 --> 13:54.976
Uh, I had my time in the big leagues,

13:55.010 --> 13:56.844
lost sight of the simple things.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.179
And plus, I like it here in Kansas City.

13:58.213 --> 14:01.049
My mom's here. My sister's here.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.750
(Laughs)

14:02.785 --> 14:05.153
I always used to talk
about moving to New York,

14:05.187 --> 14:09.023
and then I realized I'm
a small pond kind of gal.

14:09.058 --> 14:11.759
- I know what you mean.
- (Both chuckle)

14:13.796 --> 14:16.798
Unfortunately, I gotta be across town.

14:16.832 --> 14:18.866
You need to come back tomorrow night.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.903
Me and the guys are gonna be
playing. It's gonna be a great set.

14:21.971 --> 14:24.672
Maybe I will.

14:24.707 --> 14:26.741
Okay.

14:31.681 --> 14:33.349
<i>Announcer: Illegal
immigrants are taking our jobs</i>

14:33.383 --> 14:35.251
<i>and draining Kansas resources.</i>

14:35.285 --> 14:37.253
<i>Everyone knows it's a
problem except John Kennish.</i>

14:37.287 --> 14:39.154
<i>Just listen to what his wife says... </i>

14:39.189 --> 14:41.557
<i>Kathryn's voice: John believes
in giving everyone the opportunity</i>

14:41.591 --> 14:44.126
<i>to take their shot at the American dream.</i>

14:44.160 --> 14:47.363
Unlike John Kennish, I want to
make sure Americans have a shot

14:47.397 --> 14:49.098
at the American dream.

14:49.132 --> 14:51.166
<i>Man: John Kennish. Wrong on immigration.</i>

14:51.201 --> 14:52.301
<i>Wrong for Kansas.</i>

14:52.335 --> 14:53.535
I'm Patricia Sawyer,

14:53.570 --> 14:56.272
<i>- and I approve this message.
- Announcer: Paid for... </i>

14:56.306 --> 14:58.240
Okay, she can't run that.

14:58.275 --> 15:00.142
They already are.

15:00.176 --> 15:03.279
It's all over their website.
It'll be on TV by the weekend.

15:03.346 --> 15:05.214
I cannot believe she would stoop this low.

15:05.248 --> 15:08.017
This is why I didn't
want Kathryn giving them

15:08.051 --> 15:09.351
any ammunition with that interview.

15:09.386 --> 15:12.921
(Sighs) So what do we do now?

15:12.956 --> 15:15.924
Fortunately, we have a bigger bombshell
than some stray comment on immigration.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.893
Like what?

15:17.927 --> 15:20.129
Footage of her saying we
should legalize marijuana.

15:20.163 --> 15:22.898
What, she actually said that?

15:22.932 --> 15:25.067
When she was on her college debate team.

15:25.101 --> 15:26.802
You don't think she really believes that.

15:26.836 --> 15:28.137
It doesn't matter what I believe.

15:28.171 --> 15:31.840
We show people that you're a patriot.

15:31.875 --> 15:33.042
And we'll show Sawyer

15:33.076 --> 15:36.078
as some soft-on-crime pothead.

15:36.112 --> 15:38.747
Voters'll make up their own mind.

15:47.157 --> 15:51.026
So what crappy thing happened to you today?

15:51.061 --> 15:52.928
What?

15:52.962 --> 15:55.798
You're shooting baskets at night.

15:55.832 --> 15:58.600
It's kind of your go-to when you're upset.

16:00.870 --> 16:03.539
I went to see Travis' mom today.

16:03.573 --> 16:05.941
She said they're not throwing him out.

16:05.975 --> 16:08.744
Is that not good news?

16:08.778 --> 16:11.947
She said he's the one who
doesn't want to be there.

16:11.981 --> 16:15.484
I mean, I'm sure it's not
the happiest place on earth,

16:15.518 --> 16:18.554
but it's better than being homeless.

16:18.588 --> 16:21.790
Hmm. If only there was a place

16:21.825 --> 16:24.860
with lots of empty rooms

16:24.894 --> 16:27.730
that wouldn't charge him rent.

16:27.764 --> 16:31.533
I tried, but for whatever
reason, he won't let me help him.

16:31.568 --> 16:34.403
(Scoffs) Because he likes you.

16:35.538 --> 16:37.673
I know.

16:37.707 --> 16:40.376
All right, I'm just gonna ask.

16:40.410 --> 16:41.777
Do you like him?

16:41.811 --> 16:43.746
No.

16:43.780 --> 16:47.583
Really? You're not into deaf Matt Damon?

16:47.617 --> 16:49.318
Not even a little bit?

16:49.352 --> 16:50.586
No.

16:53.390 --> 16:55.357
Good.

16:55.392 --> 16:58.627
Because I've been hooking up
with him for the last month.

16:58.661 --> 17:00.462
What? You have?

17:00.497 --> 17:02.264
No.

17:02.298 --> 17:04.366
I just wanted to see

17:04.401 --> 17:07.102
if you had a jealous reaction,

17:07.137 --> 17:09.371
which you kind of did.

17:09.406 --> 17:13.075
Maybe you're more into him

17:13.108 --> 17:14.510
than you think.

17:21.217 --> 17:23.484
I'm sorry they're using
my interview against you,

17:23.520 --> 17:25.988
but this... this isn't right.

17:26.021 --> 17:27.321
I didn't make her say it.

17:27.357 --> 17:30.325
It was a college debate, John.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.162
She didn't get to choose
what side she argued.

17:33.196 --> 17:36.131
Besides, you supported all kinds of
crazy things when you were that age.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.033
I didn't do it on tape.

17:39.302 --> 17:42.004
Don't let Ivan drag you into the gutter.

17:42.038 --> 17:44.072
If you don't fight back,
they think you're weak,

17:44.107 --> 17:46.308
and they hit you even harder.

17:46.342 --> 17:48.877
Okay, do what you want, John.

17:48.912 --> 17:51.146
'Cause that's what you're gonna do anyway.

18:00.722 --> 18:02.623
We're here!

18:02.657 --> 18:05.525
<i>- Kathryn: Oh, hi.
- John: Hello.</i>

18:05.560 --> 18:07.427
John Kennish. How are you?

18:07.462 --> 18:11.632
- Um, pregnant. How are you?
- (Laughing)

18:11.666 --> 18:14.234
Kathryn Kennish. You look fantastic.

18:14.269 --> 18:16.203
Oh, thanks.

18:16.237 --> 18:19.273
Congratulations to you.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.707
I...

18:20.742 --> 18:23.277
<i>well, I read this morning in the paper</i>

18:23.311 --> 18:25.545
that your book is being
turned into a movie.

18:25.580 --> 18:26.680
It is?

18:26.714 --> 18:28.548
You didn't tell us.

18:28.583 --> 18:30.484
That's because

18:30.518 --> 18:32.653
it was actually written by my competition

18:32.687 --> 18:36.423
Sarah Lazar.

18:36.457 --> 18:38.292
I...

18:38.326 --> 18:40.494
I kind of stepped on that rake.

18:40.528 --> 18:43.297
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- No no no, it's fine, no.</i>

18:47.268 --> 18:48.502
Well, come on in and sit down.

18:48.536 --> 18:50.604
Awkward family dinners are
a big tradition around here.

18:50.638 --> 18:53.106
(Bay and Toby chuckle)

18:59.347 --> 19:02.316
I'm gonna go to the
movies. You want to come?

19:02.350 --> 19:05.319
- What are you seeing?
- Whatever gets me out of the house the longest.

19:05.353 --> 19:10.157
(Laughs) This deaf studies
paper is not gonna write itself.

19:10.191 --> 19:14.027
Oh. Okay, I'm gonna go get ready.

20:22.997 --> 20:26.433
Please. I remember how much my
back hurt when I was carrying Bay.

20:26.467 --> 20:29.002
Technically, Daphne.

20:30.271 --> 20:33.273
What? Just saying it wasn't my fault.

20:46.320 --> 20:51.324
<i>So I noticed your campaign
signs in the front.</i>

20:51.359 --> 20:53.226
- You're running for office?
- I am indeed.

20:53.261 --> 20:55.028
I'm hoping I can count on your vote.

20:56.230 --> 20:58.198
I'm guessing you're a republican.

20:58.232 --> 20:59.833
Why would you assume that?

20:59.867 --> 21:02.035
Rich, white, old.

21:02.070 --> 21:04.004
I'm not that old, sweetie.

21:04.038 --> 21:06.840
And besides, I have some liberal views.

21:07.909 --> 21:09.042
Like what?

21:10.278 --> 21:12.846
Like the environment.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.049
And, uh... yeah.

21:16.084 --> 21:17.784
Right, Kathryn?

21:17.819 --> 21:20.253
Oh, so now I'm allowed to have an opinion.

21:20.288 --> 21:21.888
Yeah. (Chuckles)

21:21.923 --> 21:23.990
Ooh, let's talk about religion next.

21:24.025 --> 21:26.960
So... did you guys know

21:26.994 --> 21:30.831
- that Lana's in medical school?
- Oh, wow, that's great.

21:30.865 --> 21:32.866
Yeah, this is not exactly

21:32.900 --> 21:34.935
how I imagined graduating med school.

21:34.969 --> 21:36.837
Angelo has a way of doing that.

21:36.871 --> 21:38.905
He's like a wrecking
ball with a French accent.

21:38.940 --> 21:41.074
Well, to be fair,

21:41.109 --> 21:44.010
he has offered to help
out any way that he can.

21:44.045 --> 21:46.213
If he really wanted to
help, he'd stay away.

21:46.247 --> 21:48.949
Bay, that's enough.
This is Lana's decision.

21:48.983 --> 21:50.817
I'm sure she can use the support.

21:50.852 --> 21:53.019
I'm sorry. Are you seriously defending him?

21:53.054 --> 21:54.821
He treated Angelo like a serial killer.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.924
- I wasn't even allowed to be alone with him.
- Bay, come on.

21:57.959 --> 21:59.759
You know he abandoned his first kid, right?

21:59.794 --> 22:03.029
And as soon as things get tough with
this one, he'll split on you, too.

22:03.064 --> 22:04.064
- Bay!
- Okay, that's enough.

22:04.098 --> 22:08.735
Okay, actually, it is
not gonna be an issue.

22:09.804 --> 22:12.706
I am giving the baby up for adoption.

22:12.740 --> 22:15.709
Wow, that's... great.

22:15.743 --> 22:16.910
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.979
If you're giving the baby up for adoption,

22:19.013 --> 22:20.947
why did you want to meet us so badly?

22:24.785 --> 22:26.753
I thought that_

22:26.787 --> 22:28.989
you guys wanted to meet me.

22:37.765 --> 22:39.699
Toby.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.635
Uh...

22:41.669 --> 22:44.905
why don't I give Lana a tour of
the rest of the house before we eat?

22:48.809 --> 22:50.844
Okay, yeah.

22:50.878 --> 22:51.912
Um...

23:12.700 --> 23:14.834
John: How can we help you, sir?

23:14.869 --> 23:18.572
I'm just following up on Regina
Vasquez and Angelo Sorrento.

23:18.606 --> 23:22.409
Well, they don't live here anymore.

23:22.443 --> 23:25.612
I'm aware of that. I just need to
verify that they've both moved out

23:25.646 --> 23:28.648
and that they're not
maintaining separate residences.

23:28.683 --> 23:31.384
You don't mind if I take
a look around, do you?

23:31.419 --> 23:32.819
No, not at all.

23:38.926 --> 23:41.661
- I had to say, I think she moved
- _

23:41.696 --> 23:43.997
like about two, three weeks ago, right?

23:44.031 --> 23:45.765
- Yeah, two.
- Yeah.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.667
Well, let me just take a
quick look in the guesthouse,

23:47.702 --> 23:50.637
- and I'll be out of your hair.
- No problem.

23:50.671 --> 23:54.007
Oh, I feel so rude. I
didn't offer you a drink.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.042
- Would you like some hors oeuvres?
- No, ma'am.

23:56.077 --> 23:59.946
- I gotta ask you something. Are you a Royals fan?
- (Chuckles)

23:59.981 --> 24:02.716
Can't stand them. No offense.

24:02.750 --> 24:04.918
- I grew up in St. Louis.
- A Cards fan?

24:04.952 --> 24:07.854
I'm sorry, Officer, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

24:07.888 --> 24:09.589
(Men laugh)

24:11.859 --> 24:14.661
Well, if it counts, my
son's crazy about the Royals.

24:14.695 --> 24:17.697
Well, I gotta sign a ball for him
then. Come on. But you know what?

24:17.732 --> 24:20.800
- If he sells it on eBay, I get a cut.
- (Chuckles)

24:20.835 --> 24:21.935
(Whispers) Now, now.

24:21.969 --> 24:25.005
(Taps)

24:26.040 --> 24:27.774
(Sighs)

24:38.919 --> 24:41.554
(Cellphone buzzes)

24:48.863 --> 24:51.831
Kathryn, someone is blocking my car in.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.467
That would be this
gentleman from immigration.

24:54.502 --> 24:57.437
- He's here for an inspection.
- Mrs. Vasquez,

24:57.471 --> 24:58.672
I thought you moved out.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.807
That's right.

25:33.808 --> 25:36.443
I was just here visiting my
daughter. (Clears throat)

25:36.477 --> 25:39.713
Both of them, actually. You remember
the whole switched at birth thing.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.781
<i>- Pretty hard to forget.
- Kathryn: Mm-hmm.</i>

25:45.386 --> 25:47.687
Uh, don't you need to
inspect my current residence?

25:47.722 --> 25:49.689
I'm on my way over there
now, if you want to follow me.

25:49.724 --> 25:53.359
That'd be great... after I've
verified you've vacated these premises.

25:53.394 --> 25:57.363
You see, a lot of sham couples
say that they've moved in together.

25:57.398 --> 25:59.632
They put up a few photos and
toiletries in the new place.

25:59.667 --> 26:00.700
They make it look real good,

26:00.735 --> 26:03.670
but we catch them when
we visit the old place

26:03.704 --> 26:05.739
and find one of them still living there.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.575
Now, which way to the guesthouse?

26:08.609 --> 26:11.478
You know what? I better show you.

26:11.512 --> 26:13.246
Mm-hmm.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.714
Well, it looks like you're in luck.

26:14.749 --> 26:18.284
I managed to scrounge one up.
Now whom do I make this out to?

26:18.319 --> 26:20.520
Dad, Ivan is on the phone for you.

26:20.554 --> 26:22.388
Okay, tell him I'll call him right back.

26:22.423 --> 26:24.724
No, he really needs to
talk to you, like now.

26:24.759 --> 26:27.594
Okay, can you hold on to
that for me for one second?

26:27.628 --> 26:29.395
I'll be right back.

26:29.430 --> 26:30.630
Give me that. Thank you.

26:40.641 --> 26:43.476
- Yeah, yeah, I'll talk to you later.
- I'll be right back.

26:43.511 --> 26:45.445
<i>(Beeps)</i>

26:45.479 --> 26:48.214
That was Ivan. Apparently,
someone is tweeting

26:48.249 --> 26:50.183
about immigration raiding our house.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.285
How? This guy just got
here a few minutes ago.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.454
Ivan thinks this surprise
inspection was orchestrated

26:54.488 --> 26:56.222
by someone in the Sawyer campaign...

26:56.257 --> 26:59.192
apparently in retaliation for
us releasing the debate video.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.294
<i>- (Doorbell rings)
- See? These things just escalate.</i>

27:01.328 --> 27:03.329
Sweetie, can we fight
about this later, please?

27:03.364 --> 27:06.533
If immigration busts us,
your campaign is over.

27:06.567 --> 27:10.103
I am fully aware of that.
I am going to kill Angelo.

27:10.137 --> 27:12.572
- Well, now's your chance.
- I came as soon as I got Kathryn's text.

27:12.606 --> 27:15.208
- I brought Gina's wedding ring.
- Well, that's not gonna matter

27:15.242 --> 27:17.210
if that guy figures out
Regina's living here.

27:33.563 --> 27:35.062
_

27:36.953 --> 27:38.390
_

27:41.453 --> 27:42.950
_

27:47.541 --> 27:49.442
(Sighs)

27:51.445 --> 27:54.080
Hi.

27:54.114 --> 27:56.015
This man needs

27:56.050 --> 27:59.085
to look around Regina's old bedroom.

27:59.119 --> 28:02.121
I don't understand.

28:02.156 --> 28:04.991
My sign language isn't very good.

28:05.025 --> 28:07.227
Just a sec, huh?

28:07.261 --> 28:10.363
- This man needs to look
- _

28:10.397 --> 28:13.019
- at Regina's old bedroom.
- _

28:13.620 --> 28:14.596
_

28:14.597 --> 28:20.439
_

28:20.441 --> 28:23.409
Is there a problem?

28:23.444 --> 28:27.113
No no, she's just embarrassed
'cause it's kind of messy.

28:27.147 --> 28:29.082
Where's her bedroom, please?

28:31.318 --> 28:33.253
Okay, it's...

28:33.287 --> 28:35.088
it's down here.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.231
What the hell?

28:48.402 --> 28:52.171
Are you actually living here now?

28:52.206 --> 28:56.075
"No, I just like to walk around in a towel

28:56.110 --> 28:57.210
in other people's houses.

28:57.244 --> 28:59.846
What do you think?"

28:59.880 --> 29:02.215
He moved in after my mom moved out.

29:02.283 --> 29:04.817
Yep, they're friends. She lives over there.

29:09.189 --> 29:11.791
<i>Daphne: "So if you don't mind,
I'd like to go back to my shower.</i>

29:11.825 --> 29:13.793
<i>Unless you want to do my back." (Chuckles)</i>

29:13.827 --> 29:16.229
Right. No.

29:16.263 --> 29:18.865
Sorry to have bothered you.

29:22.937 --> 29:25.204
- So you're not hungry?
- No.

29:27.107 --> 29:29.108
- (Laughing)
- (Sighs)

29:32.212 --> 29:34.814
It just never ends, does it?

29:34.848 --> 29:36.182
<i>(Kathryn clears throat)</i>

29:37.985 --> 29:39.152
<i>Kathryn: Well... </i>

29:39.186 --> 29:41.721
Mr. Sorrento,

29:41.755 --> 29:43.790
what are you doing here?

29:43.824 --> 29:45.792
Oh, he's here for dinner, too.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.027
- Fashionably late like usual.
- I know.

29:48.062 --> 29:49.162
Well, I will let you get to your dinner.

29:49.196 --> 29:50.997
I've seen everything I need to see here.

29:51.031 --> 29:52.799
Sorry for any inconvenience.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.835
- No problem at all.
- Hey, guys.

29:55.869 --> 29:58.171
- What's going on?
- Hi.

30:00.207 --> 30:02.909
Hi.

30:04.878 --> 30:08.815
- Have we met?
- I don't think so.

30:08.849 --> 30:12.785
No, we have. I met you on the
elevator when I was visiting Angelo.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.057
You two know each other?

30:18.092 --> 30:21.761
(Sighs) I'm his wife.

30:21.795 --> 30:23.796
<i>Julian: Wait, wait, wait.</i>

30:23.831 --> 30:25.698
You're friends with Mr. Sorrento,

30:25.733 --> 30:27.700
but you didn't know that this is his wife?

30:28.969 --> 30:30.937
I'm sorry, who are you?

30:30.971 --> 30:32.939
I'm with Immigration Customs Enforcement.

30:32.973 --> 30:35.708
Exactly how good of friends
are you with Mr. Sorrento?

30:40.147 --> 30:43.850
We aren't really friends.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.084
Then what is the relationship?

30:46.720 --> 30:47.754
(Sighs)

30:50.858 --> 30:51.824
Umm...

30:56.697 --> 30:59.732
(Sighs) I'm carrying his baby.

31:09.743 --> 31:10.643
Sir, it's not what it looks like.

31:10.678 --> 31:11.678
There's really a very simple explanation.

31:12.712 --> 31:14.436
All this happened in Italy
before we were married.

31:14.437 --> 31:16.693
They're together. It's just complicated.

31:16.694 --> 31:18.786
This seems like a private
matter. I'm just gonna go.

31:18.787 --> 31:19.348
Okay, enough.

31:20.284 --> 31:21.689
I can explain everything.

31:26.790 --> 31:27.608
Okay.

31:28.913 --> 31:29.989
Can we talk in private?

31:32.722 --> 31:33.839
Nobody go anywhere.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.232
_

31:52.680 --> 31:54.203

31:54.204 --> 31:56.227

32:38.376 --> 32:41.442
_

32:54.159 --> 32:56.643
Ah, I come bearing ribs.

32:56.547 --> 32:59.283
Actually, there's a little
bit of everything, you know,

32:59.317 --> 33:02.185
since we missed the dinner
portion of the awkward dinner.

33:02.220 --> 33:04.488
Right, thank you.

33:04.522 --> 33:07.524
It was really sweet of you.

33:07.558 --> 33:10.227
Your dad told me how
good of an artist you are.

33:10.261 --> 33:12.229
He wasn't kidding.

33:12.263 --> 33:13.597
Thank you.

33:13.631 --> 33:16.199
I could barely draw stick figures.

33:16.234 --> 33:18.335
Hopefully she doesn't inherit

33:18.369 --> 33:20.504
my artistic abilities.

33:20.538 --> 33:23.440
Sorry you got caught up in all this.

33:23.474 --> 33:26.243
I didn't know what to say to that guy.

33:26.277 --> 33:28.445
I hope I didn't get anybody in trouble.

33:28.479 --> 33:30.580
Please. You have enough to worry about.

33:30.615 --> 33:33.250
<i>How's the baby? When's the next checkup?</i>

33:33.284 --> 33:36.153
You can stop competing for
the father of the year award.

33:36.187 --> 33:38.355
She's giving the kid up for adoption.

33:38.389 --> 33:41.591
Why didn't you tell me about this?

33:41.626 --> 33:44.561
Don't you think that's a
decision we both should make?

33:44.595 --> 33:47.297
Why? You weren't a father to Daphne.

33:47.332 --> 33:49.399
You've barely been a father to me.

33:49.434 --> 33:51.401
Why start now?

33:53.137 --> 33:54.304
(Sighs)

33:58.509 --> 34:01.044
This hasn't been easy for us.

34:01.079 --> 34:04.081
Me and Angelo. I mean, we had...

34:04.115 --> 34:06.083
we had really just started to
put the pieces back together

34:06.117 --> 34:08.418
after the whole switched
at birth thing came out.

34:08.453 --> 34:10.454
And then I found out

34:10.487 --> 34:13.255
that Angelo...

34:13.291 --> 34:16.025
my husband had an affair.

34:16.060 --> 34:18.061
When did that happen?

34:18.096 --> 34:19.429
A few months before we were married.

34:19.464 --> 34:22.299
He promised me that it
was a one-time thing...

34:22.333 --> 34:25.202
not that it made it hurt any less.

34:25.235 --> 34:28.170
You're aware that if any of
what you're telling me is false,

34:28.206 --> 34:31.074
you could go to jail.

34:31.029 --> 34:34.331
Yes, but I'm telling you the truth.

34:34.364 --> 34:38.068
I just want you to know that if any
immigration fraud is happening here,

34:38.101 --> 34:40.904
and you tell me about it right now,

34:40.938 --> 34:43.219
I'll make sure no criminal
charges are brought against you.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.985
Now...

34:51.155 --> 34:53.857
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me?

35:00.765 --> 35:03.066
I'm sorry about what happened with Lana.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.769
I'm not proud of it.

35:05.803 --> 35:07.971
But that has nothing to do with you and me.

35:08.006 --> 35:10.140
Everything everyone has ever told me

35:10.174 --> 35:12.042
about you is true.

35:12.076 --> 35:14.745
What do you want from me?

35:16.080 --> 35:18.849
I wanted

35:18.883 --> 35:21.118
an amazing dad,

35:21.152 --> 35:24.755
like the one that Daphne got when
we first found out about the switch.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.890
And what did I get?

35:28.059 --> 35:29.826
I got a mom who wouldn't
even tell me your name.

35:29.861 --> 35:32.929
That's how badly she
wanted to keep you from me.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.165
But I went looking for you
anyway because I thought

35:35.199 --> 35:37.000
that you would be this...

35:39.037 --> 35:41.204
missing piece that made
everything make sense.

35:41.239 --> 35:45.809
But you are just this huge disappointment.

35:48.112 --> 35:50.814
I gave up my life

35:50.848 --> 35:52.849
in Chicago to come here.

35:52.884 --> 35:55.819
And then I spent four months in detention.

35:55.853 --> 35:58.789
You have no idea what that was like.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.924
I could've gotten out any time I wanted.

36:00.958 --> 36:03.060
All I had to do was to
agree to go back to Italy.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.998
But I stayed so I could be with you.

36:08.032 --> 36:11.968
So if you want to shut me out, it's fine.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.971
But you can never say that I haven't tried.

36:29.982 --> 36:32.917
Based on what Ms. Vasquez just told me,

36:32.952 --> 36:35.220
this marriage has so many
problems, it has to be real.

36:35.254 --> 36:36.221
(Sighs)

36:39.191 --> 36:40.992
We're trying to work through this.

36:41.026 --> 36:44.129
If you can find a way to forgive
Mr. Sorrento his indiscretions,

36:44.163 --> 36:45.830
I guess I can, too.

36:45.865 --> 36:47.198
Thank you.

36:47.233 --> 36:49.901
Well, thank you very much.

36:49.935 --> 36:51.870
Don't forget your baseball. (Chuckles)

36:53.873 --> 36:57.008
Listen, I remember you
two from your interview.

36:57.042 --> 37:00.011
I really hope you can work through
this. You seem like a good couple.

37:04.283 --> 37:06.951
We used to be.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.921

37:12.124 --> 37:13.191

37:21.233 --> 37:23.868
What were you doing, stalking me?

37:23.903 --> 37:26.237
No, that was an accident.

37:26.272 --> 37:28.840
I just was so...

37:28.874 --> 37:30.074
(Sighs)

37:31.343 --> 37:34.179
I'm sorry. I should've told you.

37:34.213 --> 37:36.881
I just didn't know what to say.

37:39.118 --> 37:41.319
I didn't know about you in Rome.

37:41.353 --> 37:43.354
I don't care.

37:43.389 --> 37:46.024
In fact, I should be thanking you.

37:47.193 --> 37:50.094
It was never gonna work
between me and Angelo.

37:54.099 --> 37:56.000
(Sighs)

37:56.035 --> 37:58.136
I don't know what I was thinking.

37:58.170 --> 37:59.871
I just thought... I don't know...

37:59.905 --> 38:03.208
when I ran into Lana for the
second time totally out of the blue,

38:03.242 --> 38:05.143
I thought it was for a reason.

38:05.177 --> 38:08.046
We had this great connection. I
thought everybody else would, too.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.315
But I don't know.

38:10.349 --> 38:13.184
That's the last time I try
to pull a "Kathryn Kennish."

38:13.219 --> 38:16.087
Lesson learned. Total disaster.

38:16.121 --> 38:18.089
No, honey. I don't think it was.

38:20.226 --> 38:22.767
If you're thinking about
adoption because things are tough,

38:22.768 --> 38:23.768
I can help.

38:24.063 --> 38:26.064
You don't have to do this alone.

38:26.098 --> 38:28.199
I will do whatever you want.

38:28.234 --> 38:31.970
Honestly, all I want right
now is just to go home.

38:32.004 --> 38:34.072
Please let me drive you.

38:37.243 --> 38:38.276
Say it.

38:38.310 --> 38:40.078
Say what?

38:40.112 --> 38:42.113
Say it.

38:42.147 --> 38:44.249
Okay, I admit it.

38:44.283 --> 38:47.051
Releasing the tape was wrong.

38:47.086 --> 38:48.920
And?

38:48.954 --> 38:51.356
And... you were right.

38:51.390 --> 38:55.193
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

38:55.227 --> 38:57.195
You don't need to play dirty.

38:57.229 --> 39:00.064
You never used pine tar or corked your bat.

39:00.099 --> 39:01.933
I know. It just pissed me off...

39:01.967 --> 39:05.270
those guys thinking they could
get away with attacking you.

39:05.304 --> 39:08.039
Well, if attacking me is all they got,

39:08.073 --> 39:09.340
then they got nothing.

39:09.375 --> 39:11.976
- Mmm.
- It just shows how scared they are of you.

39:12.011 --> 39:14.979
Sounds like Ivan is the one who
needs to be reined in, right?

39:17.216 --> 39:18.950
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps.

39:23.989 --> 39:28.026
<i>(Smooth jazz music begins)</i>

40:09.368 --> 40:11.502
(Cheering, applause)

40:11.537 --> 40:14.138
Thank you, everybody. We're
gonna take a five-minute break.

40:19.144 --> 40:21.446
(Chuckles)

40:21.480 --> 40:24.315
<i>- Actually, make that 10.

40:29.555 --> 40:31.556
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:31.590 --> 40:35.326
I was wondering if you were gonna show.

40:35.361 --> 40:37.562
- So was I.
- Hmm.

40:54.313 --> 40:56.587
