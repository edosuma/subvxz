00:01.690 --> 00:03.455
<i>In the spring of 2013,</i>

00:03.483 --> 00:06.446
Barney and Robin were just weeks
away from tying the knot.

00:06.586 --> 00:09.321
<i>But there were still some pretty big
issues they hadn't agreed on.</i>

00:09.500 --> 00:10.897
Adoption.

00:11.089 --> 00:12.090
I don't know.

00:12.896 --> 00:14.164
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

00:14.176 --> 00:16.577
I can't... I can't believe
you're not open to it.

00:17.022 --> 00:19.273
Okay. Let's try it.

00:20.125 --> 00:22.793
Nope, it doesn't
work with 27 down.

00:24.781 --> 00:28.165
Hey, with the wedding so close,
maybe we should talk about

00:28.190 --> 00:29.606
where we're going to live.

00:29.623 --> 00:31.700
Fine, enough. Stop begging.

00:31.725 --> 00:33.589
We'll live here.
But you owe me.

00:33.623 --> 00:35.277
Yeah, I don't know...

00:35.295 --> 00:38.826
there's just a lot of things I don't
totally love about your apartment.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.050
Like what?

00:40.156 --> 00:41.838
Well, for example, why is

00:41.863 --> 00:44.808
your bed on what
look like train tracks?

00:46.279 --> 00:49.251
You were wonderful.

00:49.825 --> 00:52.710
Well, you don't get to be a
state-certified orgasmologist

00:52.728 --> 00:54.533
without learning
how to please a woman.

00:54.614 --> 00:56.858
You don't mind if I
spend the night, do you?

00:57.014 --> 01:00.945
Um, how else are we gonna get to
know each other on a deeper level?

01:01.319 --> 01:05.752
Excuse me, I just have to log tonight's
orgasms with the licensing board.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.924
What-what is on the
other side of the wall?

01:26.954 --> 01:28.094
Where do the hos go?

01:29.006 --> 01:30.619
What am I, a contractor?

01:30.915 --> 01:33.264
We-we need to go
into this marriage

01:33.407 --> 01:35.189
with a fresh start.

01:35.718 --> 01:38.955
What do you say we
find a new place together?

01:39.432 --> 01:40.557
I love you.

01:40.713 --> 01:42.538
And if that will
make you happy,

01:42.907 --> 01:44.251
then let's do it.

01:47.071 --> 01:50.838
Wow, so we need to find an apartment
where I haven't banged someone?

01:51.284 --> 01:52.527
How do you feel about
Cleveland?

01:52.552 --> 01:53.457
Ha, ha.

01:53.485 --> 01:54.971
Nope. Ted's mom.

Nice job filling in for
Lily on Marvin's lullaby.

02:16.176 --> 02:18.832
Thanks, but I came in
early on the horsie.

02:18.892 --> 02:20.158
Stupid!

02:20.536 --> 02:23.708
No, you really nailed
all of Lily's parts.

02:23.992 --> 02:26.385
It's been three
weeks since I have.

02:27.255 --> 02:30.012
I barely see her anymore
'cause of this new job.

02:30.966 --> 02:32.239
Well, you know what
might cheer you up?

02:32.251 --> 02:33.026
Hmm?

02:33.056 --> 02:36.308
There's a new <i>Woodworthy</i>
<i>Manor</i> on tonight.

02:36.410 --> 02:37.708
Woodworthy Manor

02:37.733 --> 02:40.056
was a show about an upper class
<i>English estate</i>

02:40.080 --> 02:41.763
<i>at the beginning</i>
<i>of the 20th century.</i>

02:41.794 --> 02:43.970
<i>My word!
You can't possibly mean...</i>

02:43.989 --> 02:45.098
<i>But I do!</i>

02:45.120 --> 02:48.428
<i>With the succession of Lady Eastbrooke
to Viscountess of Marlyemead,</i>

02:48.462 --> 02:50.438
<i>our cousin Baldrick becomes...</i>

02:50.472 --> 02:52.163
<i>the Earl of Witherstead.</i>
- The Earl of Witherstead!

02:52.187 --> 02:55.480
I only posted that prediction
15 times on the forums!

02:55.652 --> 02:56.633
No, I can't.

02:56.652 --> 02:59.380
I promised Lily that I would
wait and watch it with her.

02:59.490 --> 03:01.221
Problem is, the Captain.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.984
<i>Lily had just started</i>
<i>a job as the art consultant</i>

03:04.003 --> 03:06.236
<i>for an eccentric billionaire,</i>
<i>the Captain.</i>

03:07.230 --> 03:09.419
Oh.

03:09.647 --> 03:10.780
Ahoy.

03:10.807 --> 03:12.575
There's a hot new artist
in Red Hook.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.406
<i>He's molded</i>

03:13.425 --> 03:17.023
world currency into a sculpture
of a soulless plutocrat

03:17.047 --> 03:18.579
defecating on the poor.

03:18.617 --> 03:20.395
A scathing indictment
of capitalism.

03:20.484 --> 03:21.808
I'll go as high as $200K

03:21.820 --> 03:23.844
as long as you think I can flip
it for double in six months.

03:23.987 --> 03:25.357
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

03:25.376 --> 03:26.708
Sorry.

03:33.550 --> 03:34.497
Ahoy.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.554
Here's this gorgeously delicate
impressionist still life,

03:37.572 --> 03:39.274
reminiscent of
Monet's water lilies.

03:39.363 --> 03:40.243
Where is it?

03:40.261 --> 03:41.524
Rikers Island.

03:41.557 --> 03:43.897
The artist is serving
two consecutive life sentences

03:43.909 --> 03:45.209
for aggravated homicide.

03:45.329 --> 03:48.285
I'm willing to go as high as
six cartons of cigarettes

03:48.303 --> 03:50.187
and a jug of toilet wine.

03:50.516 --> 03:53.271
Is it a strain, feeling like a
single dad at times?

03:53.289 --> 03:55.752
Sure, but Lily's been busting
her butt at this new job.

03:55.764 --> 03:57.828
It's not like she's been
out there partying.

03:57.858 --> 03:59.311
Man, I'm 'faced.

03:59.879 --> 04:01.390
I ate a ton of caviar,

04:01.408 --> 04:03.424
but it soaked up none
of the champagne.

04:03.476 --> 04:05.359
- Mondays, right?
- Yeah.

04:06.172 --> 04:07.356
When did you get glasses?

04:07.392 --> 04:08.674
Oh...

04:09.029 --> 04:11.240
you mean my
glare reduction lunettes.

04:11.265 --> 04:13.424
Yeah.
They help me discern genius

04:13.430 --> 04:14.754
from pretentious crap.

04:14.846 --> 04:17.647
Too bad you weren't wearing those glasses
when you bought those glasses.

04:18.396 --> 04:20.014
Well, listen,
baby, I-I'm just

04:20.031 --> 04:21.180
happy to see you.

04:21.216 --> 04:22.530
And if you're not too tired,

04:22.555 --> 04:25.161
maybe we could watch
<i>Woodworthy Manor</i> tonight.

04:25.180 --> 04:26.164
I'd love to.

04:26.170 --> 04:28.604
Great! Because I've come up
with a fun little game.

04:29.016 --> 04:30.454
I made figgy pudding

04:30.472 --> 04:32.307
and I put it in shot glasses.

04:32.338 --> 04:33.462
And every time they say,

04:33.480 --> 04:35.862
"The dowager will be
less than pleased,"

04:35.880 --> 04:36.780
you have to...

04:36.806 --> 04:37.953
Oh.

04:38.264 --> 04:39.263
Ugh...

04:39.808 --> 04:40.500
Ahoy.

04:40.518 --> 04:42.641
A seven-foot-tall
cross-dressing Cambodian

04:42.671 --> 04:45.740
is throwing glitter and fish guts
at a billboard on the B.Q.E.

04:45.839 --> 04:48.241
So he's some sort of
conceptual painter?

04:48.265 --> 04:50.180
No, no, just a crazy person
on the local news.

04:50.203 --> 04:52.738
I thought you might have a laugh.
You're off the clock, relax.

04:54.631 --> 04:56.131
I must own it.

04:56.368 --> 04:58.044
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

05:00.391 --> 05:03.255
Hey, did you find a Realtor
to sell this place yet?

05:03.492 --> 05:06.980
Robin, a Realtor's just gonna
give it to the highest bidder.

05:07.111 --> 05:09.378
I need this place to go
to someone worthy.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.502
And I've made some inquiries.

05:14.827 --> 05:16.218
Barney?

05:16.997 --> 05:18.685
My son.

05:19.401 --> 05:22.097
Barney, enough
with the floating Jor-El head

05:22.115 --> 05:24.403
from the Fortress of Solitude in
<i>Superman,</i> okay?

05:24.428 --> 05:25.328
It's getting old.

05:25.359 --> 05:29.195
I only use it to say
really important stuff.

05:29.802 --> 05:31.125
Last time you used it to tell me

05:31.144 --> 05:33.953
Wendy's had introduced a spicy
version of "The Baconator."

05:34.247 --> 05:36.228
Exactly.

05:36.813 --> 05:39.360
And now, my son...

05:39.811 --> 05:42.587
it is time for me
to bestow on you...

05:42.611 --> 05:45.271
Can we just talk face-to-face
like normal people?

05:45.321 --> 05:46.823
Ted, just...

05:46.860 --> 05:48.176
just...

05:48.654 --> 05:50.126
okay?

05:50.519 --> 05:52.219
My son,

05:52.696 --> 05:55.980
it is time for me
to bestow on you...

05:59.211 --> 06:00.287
Close the door.

06:00.306 --> 06:01.096
No. This is...

06:01.127 --> 06:02.624
Oh, my God,
can you just be cool?

06:02.653 --> 06:04.320
Once? Please?

06:04.397 --> 06:05.697
Just once?

06:05.791 --> 06:07.704
Can you just once be cool?

06:07.878 --> 06:09.161
Once?

06:09.275 --> 06:10.974
Please?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.204
My son...

06:18.515 --> 06:23.573
for many years this apartment has
been my Fortress of Barnitude.

06:24.195 --> 06:27.883
But now the time has come
for me to pass it on.

06:28.461 --> 06:31.271
Soon, this place will become

06:31.290 --> 06:35.365
your "Fortress of Soli-Ted."

06:35.409 --> 06:38.562
Barney, I wouldn't live here even if
you scrubbed every inch of this place

06:38.575 --> 06:40.859
with Purell, amoxicillin
and holy water.

06:42.493 --> 06:43.859
Fine.

06:44.183 --> 06:45.745
But I think we can both agree,

06:45.763 --> 06:48.429
it would be totally awesome
to see my deal

06:48.454 --> 06:51.580
floating around all huge-like
on the big Jor-El cam.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.500
Hold on.

06:53.696 --> 06:56.013
Now, it's a little cold
here in the Fortress,

06:56.033 --> 06:57.103
so don't judge the si...

06:57.129 --> 06:58.245
Ted, wait.

06:58.728 --> 06:59.831
What did you...

06:59.850 --> 07:01.937
That's... okay,
that's not funny.

07:02.487 --> 07:03.343
Ted, open the...

07:03.355 --> 07:05.326
Uh... walls closing in.

07:05.483 --> 07:07.150
I can't... can't breathe.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.382
Must...

07:09.676 --> 07:11.461
show deal...

07:11.823 --> 07:13.437
on Jor-El cam...

07:13.556 --> 07:14.838
I can't...

07:16.680 --> 07:18.530
Oh, well, guess I'm keeping this
place forever, good night.

07:18.593 --> 07:20.144
Wait a... wait a
minute, that's it?

07:20.175 --> 07:21.908
Ted wasn't interested
in buying your apartment,

07:21.921 --> 07:23.542
so you just gave up?

07:23.881 --> 07:27.245
Barney, I gave up my
beautiful two-bedroom apartment

07:27.270 --> 07:28.940
on the Upper West Side
that was rent-free

07:28.953 --> 07:31.706
and the landlord hand-washed
all my delicates.

07:32.282 --> 07:34.583
Which is probably why
it was rent-free.

07:34.597 --> 07:35.759
The point is,

07:35.777 --> 07:37.169
I need to buy all new underwear,

07:37.181 --> 07:40.328
and you agreed that we would
find a new place together.

07:40.470 --> 07:41.572
Oh, God, Barney,

07:41.603 --> 07:44.558
relationships are about
trust and compromise.

07:44.576 --> 07:46.990
You can't just...
Oh, you are so dead.

07:47.007 --> 07:50.321
If I ever figure a way out of here,
I will make your life a living...

07:51.658 --> 07:53.374
Lily and I really
need this night out.

07:53.392 --> 07:55.685
A big fancy dinner
and the ballet.

07:55.818 --> 07:57.340
Thank you so much
for babysitting.

07:57.365 --> 07:59.606
Hey, three bucks an hour,
thank <i>you.</i>

08:03.465 --> 08:04.729
Oh, hey, baby.

08:04.747 --> 08:07.092
Yeah, I'm just on my way out.
If you get there before...

08:08.787 --> 08:10.254
Come on, really?

08:10.478 --> 08:12.145
I'll see you later.

08:13.170 --> 08:14.345
Captain?

08:14.466 --> 08:16.210
I'm sorry, dude.
But, hey,

08:16.240 --> 08:17.456
look at it this way:

08:17.497 --> 08:19.303
now you don't have
to go to the ballet.

08:19.322 --> 08:21.506
Get your head out of your ass, Ted.
There was no ballet.

08:21.537 --> 08:23.457
We were gonna sneak into
your apartment and bang.

08:25.027 --> 08:28.253
Well, you know what might
take both our minds off that?

08:28.873 --> 08:30.923
A little, uh...

08:31.218 --> 08:33.034
Woodworthy Manor.

08:34.419 --> 08:35.573
No, I-I-I can't.

08:35.592 --> 08:36.880
I-I promised Lily

08:36.914 --> 08:38.158
that I would wait
and watch it with her.

08:38.188 --> 08:39.649
And I feel like I'd
be cheating on her.

08:39.668 --> 08:41.659
Sure, sure, sure,
sure, I get all that.

08:41.678 --> 08:43.354
It's just, um...

08:43.897 --> 08:46.521
You know, tonight they're
gonna finally reveal

08:46.546 --> 08:48.679
who framed the chimney sweep

08:49.005 --> 08:52.424
for stealing
Lord Stoutshire's gooseberries.

08:53.655 --> 08:56.310
And reveal the winner of
the local gardening competition.

08:57.464 --> 09:00.330
I don't know how they're going to pack
all that action into one episode.

09:06.284 --> 09:07.940
Oops.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.244
No, Ted, you know

09:11.268 --> 09:13.447
- I promised Lily, I...
- Shh, shh, shh.

09:13.665 --> 09:15.375
Just let it happen.

09:15.968 --> 09:18.241
<i>Later that week,</i>
<i>Barney came home to discover</i>

09:18.259 --> 09:21.093
<i>that Robin had a little</i>
<i>surprise waiting for him.</i>

09:23.019 --> 09:24.662
Wha...?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.217
- Mimosas?
- Mm-hmm.

09:28.476 --> 09:30.560
Freshly-baked cookie smell?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.250
A middle-aged woman
in a red blazer?

09:33.274 --> 09:35.341
I see what this is.

09:35.958 --> 09:38.426
You finally green-lit
my orgy idea!

09:39.047 --> 09:41.404
Okay. It's an open house, Barney.

09:41.950 --> 09:43.925
Say good-bye to
your fortress.

09:44.813 --> 09:46.300
If we weren't about
to have an orgy,

09:46.312 --> 09:48.409
I'd be so mad at you right now.

09:52.905 --> 09:56.187
If you'll follow me into the bedroom,
I'll show you some beautiful woodwork.

09:56.514 --> 09:58.939
I am way too upset right now
to point out how many women

09:58.945 --> 10:00.776
have seen some beautiful
woodwork in there.

10:00.882 --> 10:02.062
Angry self five!

10:02.080 --> 10:03.079
Rah!

10:03.917 --> 10:05.602
Robin, I did not agree to this.

10:05.682 --> 10:06.742
Yes, you did.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.722
That is why I gave up
my apartment.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.524
Not so I could live in
a disease-riddled bang pad

10:11.553 --> 10:13.657
haunted by the ghosts
of your ex-skanks.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.913
The bathrooms are
Italian marble.

10:19.460 --> 10:22.048
Hello, old bean.
Jolly good evening, isn't it?

10:22.167 --> 10:23.393
What are you doing here?

10:23.418 --> 10:25.006
And why do you
sound like Madonna?

10:25.049 --> 10:26.776
Uh, Robin asked us all
to come here and pretend

10:26.801 --> 10:29.590
that we are prospective buyers
who love this apartment.

10:29.676 --> 10:31.226
And inspired by a character

10:31.251 --> 10:33.382
on <i>Woodworthy Manor,</i>
I've decided to play

10:33.407 --> 10:35.341
Emsbry Postlethwaite,

10:35.395 --> 10:38.530
a handsome cricket player
who secretly hates his life.

10:38.853 --> 10:40.520
You don't have to
be a cricket player.

10:40.553 --> 10:42.281
Tell that to Emsbry's father.

10:43.035 --> 10:44.325
Sorry!

10:44.343 --> 10:45.434
Oh...

10:45.464 --> 10:48.123
I was checking out some
mole people's graffiti art

10:48.129 --> 10:49.982
and my cape got caught
on the F train.

10:50.013 --> 10:51.012
Oh.

10:51.036 --> 10:52.285
Bisou bisou.

10:52.490 --> 10:55.394
Oh, what a cute baby.

10:55.413 --> 10:56.487
What's his name?

10:56.504 --> 10:57.412
Marvin.

10:57.436 --> 10:58.599
For my father.

10:58.787 --> 11:00.357
Oh, that's so sweet.

11:00.376 --> 11:02.820
Have you two been looking at a lot
of places in this neighborhood?

11:02.838 --> 11:06.468
- Oh, actually they're not...
- Yes, we have.

11:06.725 --> 11:07.734
What?

11:07.752 --> 11:11.972
My husband Emsbry
and I just love this area.

11:12.084 --> 11:14.701
I'm a cricket player who
secretly hates his life.

11:16.540 --> 11:17.565
What are you doing?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.593
Well, you were late yet again,

11:19.605 --> 11:21.620
and so I'm gonna do this
little scene study with Ted.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.065
Why? Because he's
there for me.

11:25.730 --> 11:27.740
Pretending you're married?

11:27.764 --> 11:30.098
That's going a little far
to prove your point, isn't it?

11:30.140 --> 11:32.654
Excuse me, but I think
it's offensive to suggest

11:32.678 --> 11:35.629
the only reason gay people get
married is to prove a point.

11:36.392 --> 11:37.826
No, no, no, no, no.

11:37.847 --> 11:39.146
I didn't...
that's not what I...

11:39.158 --> 11:40.890
Thank you, sister--
somebody needs

11:40.902 --> 11:43.576
to get this lady's mind
a rearview mirror

11:43.600 --> 11:46.946
because she is thinking in reverse.
- Mm-hmm.

11:49.641 --> 11:51.355
Hate is a four-letter word.

11:51.373 --> 11:53.584
I didn't... I voted for...

11:56.928 --> 11:59.021
Oh, is this part
of a security system?

11:59.039 --> 11:59.840
Sort of.

11:59.851 --> 12:01.826
It's connected
to the welcome mat. You see...

12:02.163 --> 12:04.006
<i>Let's say the young lady</i>
<i>you're bringing home</i>

12:04.018 --> 12:05.475

12:05.543 --> 12:08.905
<i>Under those layers, an unwelcome
surprise could await you.</i>

12:09.167 --> 12:10.933
<i>The scale</i>
<i>with body fat calculator</i>

12:10.957 --> 12:12.321
<i>I've hidden</i>
<i>under the welcome mat</i>

12:12.334 --> 12:14.794
<i>makes sure you never</i>
<i>have banger's remorse.</i>

12:18.717 --> 12:21.460
'Cause there's only one kind of
chubby you want in the bedroom.

12:21.478 --> 12:22.927
Am I right, people?

12:22.937 --> 12:25.230
This guy knows what
I'm talking about.

12:26.444 --> 12:29.807
I don't want to tell you
and Emsbry how to raise

12:29.825 --> 12:32.765
your child, but I think
if you keep letting him nap,

12:32.784 --> 12:33.968
he's gonna be up all night.

12:34.011 --> 12:36.095
Funny, you sound
like someone who's been

12:36.114 --> 12:37.906
around for his bedtime lately.

12:37.947 --> 12:40.267
Uh, can somebody get
this lady a storefront

12:40.286 --> 12:43.306
'cause she needs to mind
her own business, mm-kay?

12:44.368 --> 12:45.718
Would you stop it?

12:45.730 --> 12:48.371
Oh, right, right,
because it's a choice.

12:49.984 --> 12:51.351
You know what's not a choice?

12:51.376 --> 12:53.216
Being gay for this kitchen.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.083
That came out wrong--
the point is,

12:56.107 --> 12:58.358
let's focus on this
awesome apartment.

12:58.399 --> 12:59.865
You're right.

12:59.898 --> 13:03.206
Look at that fabulous
plasma television.

13:03.387 --> 13:06.395
My ex-husband, who never
supported my career,

13:06.513 --> 13:10.331
would love to watch the Vikings
never win a Super Bowl

13:10.356 --> 13:12.436
in franchise history
on that thing.

13:12.481 --> 13:14.731
- How dare you.
- Don't let her push your buttons.

13:15.664 --> 13:16.981
Right.

13:18.388 --> 13:20.416
I don't care about football.

13:21.163 --> 13:22.637
I'm more of a...

13:22.823 --> 13:24.438
Woodworthy Manor fan.

13:25.548 --> 13:27.606
I very much enjoyed watching it
the other night.

13:28.660 --> 13:30.801
- With Emsbry.
- Oh, you didn't.

13:30.818 --> 13:32.368
Yeah, oh, yeah.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.158
I know who deliberately overwatered
Lady Chillsbury's prize-winning roses.

13:36.239 --> 13:39.051
They have been building
to that reveal all season,

13:39.076 --> 13:40.289
Marshall, don't you tell me...

13:40.313 --> 13:42.591
It was Parson Smallsby.

13:45.745 --> 13:48.280
Wow, great view.

13:48.292 --> 13:49.533
And customizable.

13:49.614 --> 13:51.739
Let's say you promised
a girl a surprise trip

13:51.758 --> 13:53.525
to the most
romantic place on Earth.

13:54.241 --> 13:56.128
No peeking.

13:56.146 --> 13:58.574
Wow, we must've gone far.

13:58.592 --> 14:01.859
We were on your private jet
for, like, six hours.

14:02.252 --> 14:03.034
Well,

14:03.046 --> 14:04.872
You definitely weren't
on a bus to Delaware

14:04.896 --> 14:07.095
and back wearing earplugs,
I'll tell you that much.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.424
And I think you'll agree
it was worth the wait

14:09.442 --> 14:11.037
once you see the view.

14:11.368 --> 14:13.219
Et voila ma chérie.

14:15.562 --> 14:17.846
Oh, my God.

14:18.593 --> 14:20.457
You flew me to Vegas?

14:20.544 --> 14:22.799
It's, um... it's Par...

14:22.812 --> 14:24.574
Well, hey, whatever works,
whatever...

14:28.818 --> 14:30.270
I know what
you're trying to do.

14:30.289 --> 14:31.509
You're trying
to drive people away.

14:31.522 --> 14:32.626
No, I'm not--
I'm just trying

14:32.638 --> 14:34.712
to show off all of its
one-of-a-kind features.

14:34.737 --> 14:37.437
See, see, there's
also, uh, Venice.

14:38.476 --> 14:40.294
Niagara Falls,

14:41.059 --> 14:42.940
African safari.

14:44.085 --> 14:45.655
Oh... and my favorite...

14:48.837 --> 14:49.926
Huh?

14:50.151 --> 14:51.970
Nothing gets a girl to
go from "on the fence"

14:51.994 --> 14:53.690
to "on all fours" faster
than thinking

14:53.715 --> 14:56.984
everyone she's ever held dear
is a glowing pile of ash.

14:57.220 --> 14:59.187
Mushroom cloud five.

15:04.261 --> 15:06.170
I love you accent.

15:06.188 --> 15:07.308
Thank you.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.629
I practiced it all morning.

15:09.786 --> 15:11.645
- You are adorable.
- Well...

15:11.745 --> 15:13.861
That Marshall's a lucky man.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.980
Well, aren't you ducky?

15:16.025 --> 15:17.925
Seriously if you were straight,

15:17.996 --> 15:20.163
I'd be all over you.

15:20.948 --> 15:22.215
Huh.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.589
What's this?

15:24.602 --> 15:25.583
Oh, God.

15:25.606 --> 15:27.406
Only the best thing ever.

15:27.888 --> 15:30.150
<i>Let's say you had a wonderful</i>

extend the chute

15:43.848 --> 15:45.497
and add a landing spot.

15:45.763 --> 15:48.569
And you said testing it with
a dummy was a waste of time.

15:48.852 --> 15:51.993
No, I said "dressing the dummy"
was a waste of time.

He's kidding, it's just,
you know, in case of fire.

15:58.326 --> 16:00.519
No, but I'm glad
you mentioned fire.

16:00.580 --> 16:02.499
See those smoke detectors?

16:04.216 --> 16:05.584
Say these words.

16:06.801 --> 16:08.907
"I'm looking for
a deeper commitment."

16:10.642 --> 16:14.088
It's also triggered by "I'm too
tired," "Let's snuggle,"

16:14.113 --> 16:15.446
and "I'm a week late."

16:15.629 --> 16:17.245
Barney, I'm getting wet.

16:17.573 --> 16:19.355
And that turns it off.

16:20.278 --> 16:22.096
Look, just stop talking.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.799
We've made up our minds.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.715
Oh, well,
thanks for taking a look.

16:25.733 --> 16:26.816
I'll walk you out.

16:26.845 --> 16:28.134
We'll take it.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.387
If you never get a black light,
you'll be so happy here.

16:31.411 --> 16:32.932
Yes, yes!

16:32.951 --> 16:33.950
Yes, yes.

16:38.734 --> 16:40.570
Trouble in paradise?

16:47.329 --> 16:49.831
We have a child together.

16:56.132 --> 16:59.115
I can't believe you watched
<i>Woodworthy Manor</i> without me.

16:59.142 --> 17:01.684
I can't believe
that you're mad at me.

17:01.711 --> 17:04.953
I've been abandoned by my wife
and my gay companion.

17:04.971 --> 17:07.173
If I get blinded in one eye
by a badminton shuttlecock,

17:07.191 --> 17:08.689
you might as well
call me Lord Esterbrooke.

17:09.558 --> 17:10.845
You watched the new one
without me?

17:10.874 --> 17:13.497
Betrayal stings,
doesn't it, Emsbry?

17:14.916 --> 17:15.862
Hey.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.040
- Hey.
- Listen.

17:17.059 --> 17:18.342
- I...
- No, me first.

17:18.773 --> 17:19.945
I've been thinking

17:19.958 --> 17:21.424
and I realized something.

17:22.170 --> 17:25.845
The Fortress of Solitude is
where Superman went to be alone.

17:26.494 --> 17:28.846
And I never want
to be alone again.

17:29.385 --> 17:30.950
Thank you, Barney,
that really...

17:30.981 --> 17:33.031
But then I remembered
in <i>Superman II,</i>

17:33.061 --> 17:36.088
Superman gave up all his powers
to be with Lois Lane,

17:36.094 --> 17:38.783
and he was honestly kind of
a vag after that.

17:38.795 --> 17:40.734
- Oh, buddy, just quit while...
- Now, <i>Superman III</i> was

17:40.746 --> 17:42.058
a complete train wreck totally.

17:42.083 --> 17:43.132
What's your point?

17:43.146 --> 17:44.145
That...

17:44.466 --> 17:45.769
that I love you.

17:45.844 --> 17:47.200
And...

17:47.779 --> 17:49.965
I'm giving up
my apartment for you.

17:50.613 --> 17:54.672
And that the Superman films
are uneven.

17:56.010 --> 17:58.462
I really appreciate
that, Barney, but...

17:59.635 --> 18:02.843
Congrats. You guys are getting
a fantastic apartment.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.836
I mean, I know some of the
features are a little weird.

18:06.513 --> 18:07.671
A little?

18:08.189 --> 18:10.347
We're gonna rip this thing
down to the studs.

18:11.047 --> 18:12.206
I get it.

18:12.324 --> 18:15.117
But, I mean, some things
might be worth saving.

18:15.267 --> 18:17.518
- I don't see any.
- No.

18:18.133 --> 18:19.790
You don't see any?

18:20.191 --> 18:21.695
Sure some of the stuff in here

18:21.701 --> 18:24.202
is creepy,
but it's also brilliant.

18:24.349 --> 18:27.135
I mean, a lot of geniuses
were kind of pervy.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.206
Look at Thomas Edison--
why do you think

18:29.219 --> 18:30.769
that lightbulbs are boob-shaped?

18:30.969 --> 18:33.525
Yeah, we're taking
a wrecking ball to this place

18:33.537 --> 18:36.652
and turning it into something
actually fit for humans.

18:39.014 --> 18:40.473
Excuse me.

18:47.002 --> 18:48.368
Get out!

18:48.420 --> 18:51.588
The Fortress of Barnitude
is no longer for sale.

18:51.616 --> 18:54.142
Also your husband has
been staring at my ass

18:54.161 --> 18:57.177
all afternoon so don't
act all high-and-mighty.

18:58.148 --> 18:59.976
- You turned them down?
- Yeah.

19:00.393 --> 19:03.604
If I ask you to change
too many things about yourself,

19:03.803 --> 19:06.442
you're not gonna be the man
I fell in love with.

19:06.806 --> 19:11.181
Turns out, I accept and appreciate
even the grossest, creepiest,

19:11.206 --> 19:13.457
most sociopathic parts of you.

19:15.096 --> 19:18.100
Sounds like somebody
just wrote her vows.

19:19.669 --> 19:20.804
Mm.

19:22.553 --> 19:24.161
It's the Captain.

19:25.130 --> 19:25.975
Ahoy.

19:25.981 --> 19:28.016
There's a zebra
at the Central Park Zoo

19:28.034 --> 19:30.421
who's got quite a keen hoof
at photography.

19:30.477 --> 19:32.375
Ironically, he's great
with color. Now...

19:32.387 --> 19:35.605
Captain, I'll check it
out, just not tonight.

19:35.874 --> 19:38.442
I need to spend some
time with my husband.

19:39.823 --> 19:40.974
You sure?

19:41.055 --> 19:44.033
I know it's been tough,
me working this much,

19:44.564 --> 19:46.260
and I guess I went
a little overboard

19:46.278 --> 19:47.681
with the whole artsy thing.

19:47.697 --> 19:48.964
I know.

19:49.247 --> 19:50.888
- The cape.
- What about my cape?

19:50.925 --> 19:52.289
I love it.

19:52.393 --> 19:54.079
And I...
I know that you love this job.

19:54.098 --> 19:55.824
I should be more supportive--
I just miss you.

19:55.842 --> 19:57.725
I miss you, too.

19:58.302 --> 19:59.158
Hey, guys.

19:59.189 --> 20:00.816
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.760
You guys are all so lucky.

20:03.993 --> 20:06.288
When am I gonna
find something real?

20:06.440 --> 20:07.672
Well, Emsbry,

20:07.698 --> 20:09.749
ready to see what it's like
to be with a woman?

20:10.714 --> 20:13.537
I suppose there's
a first time for everything.

20:14.734 --> 20:16.768
- Go ahead.
- My son.

20:18.812 --> 20:19.811
Okay.

20:20.138 --> 20:21.952
Yeah, all right.

20:26.622 --> 20:29.777
Are you guys sure we're gonna
like this <i>Woodworthy Manor</i> show?

20:29.832 --> 20:31.373
Yeah, it sounds kind of boring.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.222
Kind of boring?

20:34.257 --> 20:36.190
Grab a seat guys, but trust me,

20:36.317 --> 20:38.050
you're only gonna
need the edge.

20:38.883 --> 20:40.535
Ah-ha, all right, now,

20:40.547 --> 20:41.997
a little backstory.

20:42.031 --> 20:45.859
Lady Stoutshire has developed
a serious case of croquet ankle

20:45.871 --> 20:49.397
and the cook Mrs. Bootbrush
can't find enough chestnuts

20:49.410 --> 20:51.638
for a proper
St. Crispin's Day goose.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.084
Let's watch.

21:04.918 --> 21:07.065
- I love you.
- My wrist is broken.

21:07.138 --> 21:09.413
- Worth it.
- Ow.
