14:42.760 --> 14:43.761
My name's Burn.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.251
I had word from your man in Camden town
you wanted a parley.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.645
Then parley it is.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.161
Few months ago,

14:55.280 --> 14:58.250
a man named Ryan came to this place with
a view to buying some goods from you.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.529
Mr Ryan met with an accident,
he was shot.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.401
TOMMY: I heard.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.251
BURN: He was a man with a quick mouth.
I know that.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.162
Wondered if he made
any enemies in here?

15:09.240 --> 15:10.526
None that I know of.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.128
Not the kind of place to make enemies.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.726
- All are welcome here, Mr Burn.
- Including Irish?

15:16.400 --> 15:18.209
Oh, especially Irish.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.010
Ryan told you he was a member
of the Irish Republican Army.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.203
Was he still welcome?

15:25.280 --> 15:27.965
Like I say. Any man who buys
beer is welcome.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.849
Perhaps you didn't believe him?

15:35.240 --> 15:38.084
In pubs, sometimes people say things.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.969
Sometimes it's the whisky talking.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.322
It's hard to tell which is which.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.041
As a teetotal man, I find that amusing.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.286
Except when it ends in tragedy.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.169
Would you like some water
and cordial, Mr Burn?

15:51.520 --> 15:52.726
You see, Mr Shelby,

15:53.520 --> 15:57.445
Ryan, for all his quick mouth,
was indeed connected.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.008
Very well connected to our brotherhood.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.411
By membership in blood.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.326
He was my cousin.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.768
I'm from South Armagh.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.284
I'm a man of influence there.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.409
Cordial and water will
be grand, Mr Shelby.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.642
Grace, bring some water and cordial.
Come this way.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.801
Yes, Mr Shelby.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.283
My cousin came to buy guns.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.442
And I told him I have none.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.687
Your man Danny Owen
talks a lot when he's drunk.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.402
He says the Peaky Blinders
do have the guns,

16:48.520 --> 16:50.329
brought from the factory down the road.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.568
He boasted about a stack
of Lewis machine guns,

16:52.640 --> 16:55.086
and enough belts of ammunition
to hold up God's trousers.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.401
Yup, that sounds like our Danny.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.963
- He has an imagination.
-(DOOR OPENS)

17:01.400 --> 17:05.246
Like I say, sometimes it's
the whisky does the talk.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.807
He says only your brothers
know where the guns are kept.

17:18.560 --> 17:23.691
Well, Danny also says he sees German
infantrymen on the back of mill carts.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.362
And he shoots them with his broomstick.

17:28.520 --> 17:31.251
We have men in the BSA factory.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.764
They said you has 'em.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.681
And we have men that work
in the police station.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.688

17:40.400 --> 17:43.882
Every finger in this city
points in one direction.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.049
Please don't mistake me for a fool.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.008
Let me get to the point.

18:06.240 --> 18:10.962
I don't care what kind of half-arsed
tinker operation you have going here.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.285
But I can assure you,

18:14.280 --> 18:17.045
I represent a very different
category of organisation.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.087
My cousin was shot.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.529
I am judge, jury, and executioner.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.367
I find you guilty and I pass sentence.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.125
You deliver the guns to me,

18:33.240 --> 18:36.687
or I deliver death
and hell's fury to you,

18:36.760 --> 18:39.001
and your little tribe of heathens.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.488
Am I making myself clear?

18:54.760 --> 18:58.651
Let me confess something to you,
and only to you.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.284
I have the guns, but they have
become a burden to me.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.964
Perhaps it is time
to unload that burden.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.643
For the right price.

Are you suggesting that you and I
could work together as a team?

19:58.080 --> 20:00.845
Perhaps we have more in common
than you think, Inspector.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.929
- Can you deliver him?
- With your help.

that I was not involved.

winning you that medal.

your initials engraved on my backside.

20:21.600 --> 20:27.289
Oh. My initials on your backside.
That's quite an image.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.568
Inspector, since we're
getting on so well...

20:32.640 --> 20:34.961
can you answer me a question?
