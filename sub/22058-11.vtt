00:01.043 --> 00:02.544
[woman] <i>Previously on </i>Z Nation...

00:02.628 --> 00:04.421
[man] <i>I was the founder
and CEO of Mercy Labs.</i>

00:04.505 --> 00:06.340
We were able to stop
the virus from spreading.

00:06.423 --> 00:07.841
But the side effects were too horrible.

00:07.925 --> 00:10.677
Mayday. Mayday.
Request emergency assistance.

00:10.761 --> 00:11.762
We can hear her, but she can't hear us.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.180
What do you want?

00:13.263 --> 00:14.431
I want to see my boy.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.682
-Simon?
-Kaya.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.893
It's your father.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.646
Zona soldiers just attacked us.
They stole files.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.190
All we know is the name
of the label on the files.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.734
-Black Rainbow.
-Black Rainbow is real.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.906
<i>The rain is coming.</i>

00:42.793 --> 00:43.794
[Murphy] Hey, Warren!

00:44.336 --> 00:46.755
We've been walking south
for two weeks now!

00:46.838 --> 00:48.799
Any idea where we're going yet?

00:49.591 --> 00:52.386
Not since you asked me an hour ago!

00:52.970 --> 00:55.973
Give it a rest, Murphy.
You can't rush these things.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.393
It seems like we're going a hell
of a long way based on two words,

00:59.476 --> 01:01.603
Black Rainbow, whatever that is.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.356
It sounds like some kind
of acid from the '60s.

01:05.148 --> 01:08.777
Yeah, well I definitely would've done
a few tabs of that back in the day.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.613
-Apocalyptic trippin'. Hell ya.
-Yeah?

01:11.697 --> 01:14.575
Something tells me Warren's
Black Rainbow ain't the same thing.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.993
[Murphy] No shit.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.829
What do you think those
two have to talk about?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.039
I dunno. Arithmetic and killing?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.042
Well, I mean,
what else are they gonna talk about?

01:24.126 --> 01:25.419
Politics and movies?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.046
Poor kids got screwed.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.507
No TV. No Internet. No rock n' roll.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.842
No casual teenage sex.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.137
Wouldn't be too sure about that.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.306
-Really?
-Just sayin'.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.227
What was it like being in the Marines?

01:42.853 --> 01:45.939
I'm still a Marine.
I reckon I'll die as one.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.400
They were my family.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.611
After they rescued me from my old family.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.864
Gave me something to live
for other than myself.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.866
Still does.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.536
What about you?
What keeps you going, Ten Thousand?

02:00.037 --> 02:02.039
Just trying to get back to my girl.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.332
Red?

02:03.415 --> 02:04.583
Yeah.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.461
I'm hoping she made it to Newmerica.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.590
You know that's back that way, right?

02:12.799 --> 02:15.719
Yeah, well, my dad said that
the shortest route between two points

02:15.802 --> 02:16.970
is never a straight line.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.639
So if Red's alive,

02:19.181 --> 02:21.141
following Warren is gonna get me to her.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.243
Why am I not surprised?

02:41.286 --> 02:42.829
Aw, crap.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.374
Not this place again!

02:45.457 --> 02:47.334
What? What is it?

02:47.417 --> 02:48.752
We've been here before.

02:57.803 --> 03:01.223
Warren? Why the hell
did you lead us back here?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.226
I don't know.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.937
But I intend to find out.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.316
I was afraid she was gonna say that.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.902
Look, I have one word for all of you:

03:13.985 --> 03:15.320
Kracken.

03:18.657 --> 03:22.661
Our man with the plan wasn't just
erasing files and hacking around

03:22.744 --> 03:24.579
for Black Rainbow data.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.582
[growling]

03:30.710 --> 03:33.713
[chuckling] Give me that, you rascal.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.757
He also cracked his way into NORAD

03:35.841 --> 03:38.051
looking for nuclear codes or...

03:38.135 --> 03:39.886
something worse.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.639
-[growling] I'm gonna eat you.
-[screams]

03:44.975 --> 03:46.268
Are you even listening to me?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.061
Yes.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.857
Some evil dude is trying
to destroy the rawr-orld!

03:54.651 --> 03:56.403
That doesn't worry you?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.617
I think we're annoying mommy.
Stay right here.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.913
Yes, of course it matters to me.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.709
But, you're on the case, right?

04:12.461 --> 04:15.547
Hey, the only thing
I'm worried about is you.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.342
[in zombie voice]
And this little human we made.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.804
-[growling]
-[squealiing]

04:27.309 --> 04:30.979
OK, well our little person
needs some Vitamin D.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.814
So take your son out for some daylight.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.483
Roger that.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.819
Hey, let's go work on our tans.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.451
-[continues growling]
-[continues screaming]

04:47.913 --> 04:48.872
So wait.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.958
You weren't just
downloading files from NORAD?

04:52.042 --> 04:53.835
You were uploading files?

04:54.377 --> 04:56.880
To a top secret sys admin account

04:57.798 --> 04:59.549
for Black Rainbow.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.593
[taps keyboard]

05:04.095 --> 05:05.555
The plot thickens.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.394
[both sigh]

05:13.730 --> 05:14.606
I love you.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.107
I love you.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.984
I love you right back.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.655
All right, we should go back to mommy.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.116
I know. We have to, though.
She's gonna miss us.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.327
-Yeah, I know, I know.
-I wanna stay here.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.454
I know. It was fun, wasn't it?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.043
When I was a little boy,

05:35.126 --> 05:38.797
we used to play outside all day long,
even in the winter.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.509
So we'd get on our bikes
and we would ride everywhere.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.135
And we didn't have to wear helmets.

05:44.761 --> 05:45.887
Why?

05:45.971 --> 05:47.430
Because they didn't make us.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.517
Yeah!

05:50.600 --> 05:52.435
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

05:53.144 --> 05:54.938
It was a different world.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.899
The only thing we had to worry about

05:58.400 --> 06:01.611
were neighborhood bullies
and the occasional serial killer.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.281
One day I'm gonna find a place
for you to play outside.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.408
And I'm gonna get you that bike.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.828
Of course your mom's gonna
make you wear a helmet.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.039
[zombie growls]

06:18.128 --> 06:20.964
[theme music]

06:34.436 --> 06:36.187
-You again.
-A puppy.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.150
I need you to run and tell mommy
about the puppy, OK?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.568
-Run straight to mommy!
-Mama.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.320
Run, little boy! Run!

06:43.903 --> 06:45.030
Hey!

07:20.857 --> 07:22.567
[horn honks]

07:24.569 --> 07:26.780
[growling]

07:32.369 --> 07:35.246
[screaming]

07:47.467 --> 07:49.052
Let's rock 'n roll!

07:52.889 --> 07:53.890
[girl] Got a name?

07:55.141 --> 07:56.434
It's Ten Thousand.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.144
But everybody calls me 10K.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.604
Ten Thousand?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.189
That's not a name, that's a number.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.524
That's how many zombies I'm gonna kill.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.193
So what's your name?

08:06.027 --> 08:06.861
Red.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.489
That's not a name. That's a color.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.207
Now!

08:26.673 --> 08:28.550
What in the holy heck happened here?

08:29.801 --> 08:31.511
We tried to help some people.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.388
It didn't work out.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.559
[growling]

08:37.642 --> 08:39.436
Big ass Z, 3 o'clock!

08:39.978 --> 08:40.812
Kracken!

08:44.607 --> 08:46.526
Save your bullets! He's mercy-proofed!

08:50.447 --> 08:52.991
The damn thing's blind.
He's got his helmet on backwards.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.661
Hey, dumbass!

08:58.663 --> 09:00.957
OlÃ©! [laughs]

09:03.126 --> 09:03.960
Hey!

09:10.008 --> 09:11.634
Stop playing with that Kracken!

09:20.351 --> 09:21.519
Now let's suit up.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.993
Just look at exactly what you want to hit,

09:37.577 --> 09:39.079
and the gear's gonna follow.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.003
[crows calling]

09:57.138 --> 09:58.139
Hey.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.183
Suit up. We're waiting on you.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.810
Yeah. I'm sorry.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.397
Why don't you go ahead,
and we'll see you in there.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.447
Zompocalypse is bad enough
without having memorabilia.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.117
Sorry, kid.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.786
I just wish I knew if Red was still alive.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.082
Well, maybe she'll be
waiting for us in Newmerica.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.376
Wouldn't be the first time
she came back from the dead.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.088
Do you think this is
ever all gonna be over?

10:32.549 --> 10:34.134
Yeah, I don't know, kid.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.679
You know, my brain says no.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.933
Humanity's screwed every way till Sunday
and there's nothing we can do about it.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.061
But my heart says yes.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.814
It will be over someday.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.984
And I have no reason to believe that.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.070
But if I didn't,
I may as well just crawl in a hole

10:54.154 --> 10:55.321
and mercy myself.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.535
Thanks, Doc. I think.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.245
You're welcome.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.373
Take a minute. We'll see you inside.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.455
Warren?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.081
Warren?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.336
You're sure in a hurry for someone
who doesn't know what she's doing.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.671
We need batteries for the radio.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.506
I saw solar panels on the roof.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.884
If any place will have power,
it'll be Teller's lab.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.969
You didn't come all
this way for batteries.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.098
I have the same feeling.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.684
You think Teller had
something to do with this?

12:07.477 --> 12:08.978
The dream?

12:09.479 --> 12:10.396
But how?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.568
Clearly somebody messed with your head.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.197
-Did you bring the radio?
-Yes, right here.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.908
There might be a solar outlet,
maybe a charger back in Teller's lab.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.576
If it's hot, I'll get us on the air.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.167
-10K?
-Yeah, he's coming.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.836
All right, lab's back this way.

12:35.713 --> 12:39.342
Now, Sarge, try not to step
in any of that glowing fungus.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.678
Yeah, it might be somebody's kin folk.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.263
Besides, this goo is nasty.

13:06.744 --> 13:07.704
Warren?

13:46.659 --> 13:47.493
Warren?

13:57.920 --> 13:58.963
Warren?

14:05.928 --> 14:09.724
What the hell were you doing
on an old secure landline?

14:09.807 --> 14:12.435
Logging on to an 80 baud modem?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.980
Picking up emails from the '70s?

14:16.814 --> 14:20.610
No, wait. You were uploading
some kind of run exec file.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.737
Launch codes?

14:23.571 --> 14:25.823
Launch codes for what?

14:27.784 --> 14:28.618
Mama?

14:30.745 --> 14:32.038
Mama.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.086
Why hack your way back to the '80s?

14:39.712 --> 14:40.630
Mama!

14:41.464 --> 14:42.590
Mama?

14:43.591 --> 14:44.592
A puppy!

15:25.216 --> 15:26.050
My hero.

15:27.927 --> 15:28.803
That was so...

15:29.262 --> 15:30.096
efficient.

15:31.806 --> 15:32.890
What is that?

15:33.808 --> 15:34.642
Zombie heart?

15:40.606 --> 15:41.566
Where's JZ?

15:41.983 --> 15:43.276
I sent him back to you.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.404
-JZ!
-JZ!

15:48.781 --> 15:50.450
-JZ!
-JZ!

15:50.533 --> 15:51.534
JZ!

15:51.617 --> 15:53.453
I told him to run straight to Mommy.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.829
Oh, my God! Hurry!

15:58.166 --> 15:59.167
Nana, no.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.627
Where's the puppy?

16:17.185 --> 16:19.020
What happened to Warren and 10K?

16:20.605 --> 16:22.023
They were supposed to be right behind us.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.941
Well, I wish we'd stick together.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.611
Some creepy creepy stuff
going on around here, really.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.654
I mean it's... it's creepy.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.865
You mean like this?

16:39.248 --> 16:40.583
[Doc groans]

16:45.880 --> 16:47.757
[groans] I told you.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.675
-What is it?
-Not what.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.302
Who.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.638
This is Teller's wife.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.641
She was infected by one
of their experiments.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.189
You sure this Doctor Teller's a good guy?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.484
They were trying to cure the zombie virus.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.655
Instead, this happened.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.949
Thanks, science.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.033
[thud]

17:18.996 --> 17:20.206
Where the hell is Warren?

18:19.390 --> 18:20.516
Warren?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.102
What are you doing?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.398
Warren?

18:48.419 --> 18:50.421
[air hisses]

19:13.778 --> 19:15.154
It's cool to take these off now?

19:15.905 --> 19:18.783
[ghostly voice] <i>Seven. Eight.</i>

19:20.743 --> 19:22.036
<i>Three.</i>

19:22.495 --> 19:23.663
<i>Zero.</i>

19:26.624 --> 19:29.418
You really think there's any
juice left after all these years?

19:29.502 --> 19:32.421
This conduit looks like
somebody retrofitted the electric

19:32.505 --> 19:34.840
to bring in power from
that solar on the roof.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.550
If we're lucky, that's been
feeding some of the batteries

19:36.634 --> 19:37.885
that haven't gone bad yet.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.974
Hey, guys. I think
I got something back here.

19:45.726 --> 19:46.727
Now turn your lights off.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.900
See that glow coming
from behind all that stuff?

19:52.983 --> 19:55.945
He's right. Something's got
to be powering that light.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.655
Yeah. Let's move this crap.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.165
Looks like another lab back here.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.255
What is it?

20:15.297 --> 20:18.259
I dunno. There's something in there,
but the glass is too dirty to see it.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.513
[gasps] Oh, man, there's a kid in there.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.773
I think I know whose kid this is.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.485
It's Doctor Teller's kid.

20:43.409 --> 20:47.371
[growling]

20:51.041 --> 20:53.627
[country western music]

21:43.594 --> 21:46.555
Quick, let's drag it out to the snow
before he wakes up again.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.016
-Grab his feet.
-Which end is his feet?

21:55.064 --> 21:57.191
<i>Three. Two. One.</i>

21:58.651 --> 22:00.319
[beeping]

22:00.402 --> 22:01.362
The batteries aren't holding.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.531
Are you sure you want to do that?

22:03.614 --> 22:06.492
<i>Two. Five. Zero. Nine.</i>

22:06.575 --> 22:09.745
It seems like maybe whatever
is locked in there should...

22:10.538 --> 22:11.872
stay in there.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.000
<i>One. Two.</i>

22:16.710 --> 22:18.879
<i>Five. Zero.</i>

22:23.801 --> 22:27.179
<i>Down. Down. Right.</i>

22:30.057 --> 22:33.644
<i>S-I-C-K.</i>

22:45.197 --> 22:47.741
<i>Six. Seven.</i>

22:49.743 --> 22:50.744
Warren! Look out!

23:13.142 --> 23:13.976
Warren!

23:40.461 --> 23:41.462
Have mercy.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.136
-What are you doing here?
-I was following you.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.057
What am I doing here?

23:53.849 --> 23:56.060
You were trying to get into that.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.561
I think you were having
one of your vision things.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.063
[beeping]

24:03.025 --> 24:04.443
I need to get in there.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.403
You knew the combination
to all the other locks.

24:06.487 --> 24:07.696
You're on the last one.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.957
I don't remember.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.465
This is Teller's kid.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.468
He told his wife he was dead. But...

24:31.011 --> 24:32.513
he was right here the whole time.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.015
[man] She wants to know about somebody.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.934
Somebody she can't see.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.311
Andrew.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.772
She needs to know.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.525
Where is Andrew?

24:45.693 --> 24:46.819
Who is Andrew?

24:47.653 --> 24:48.821
He was their son.

24:52.783 --> 24:55.244
It's hard being a parent
in the Apocalypse.

24:55.661 --> 24:59.164
What? So like is he frozen
in some kind of suspended animation?

25:01.834 --> 25:04.044
What kind of monster
would leave their kid like that?

25:04.128 --> 25:07.256
Maybe the pain of losing
his kid was too much.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.843
If I could've frozen Lucy,

25:11.510 --> 25:13.137
I might have done it.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.350
This panel controls
the life support for the kid.

25:19.435 --> 25:22.104
I should be able
to divert power for the radio.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.982
Well, don't cut off the little
glowing dude's life support.

25:25.065 --> 25:28.610
Don't worry. He's way beyond life support.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.571
This kid's been dead a long time.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.156
How can you be so sure?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.366
Back in the day, in my blue period,

25:34.450 --> 25:37.202
I used to be able to feel
what the undead were feeling.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.955
But now I have to rely
on more subtle clues like

25:40.038 --> 25:42.291
the giant bullet wound in his head.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.629
Good enough for me. Disconnecting.

25:50.883 --> 25:51.925
What?

25:52.009 --> 25:53.469
Wait. Stop.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.471
Stop. Turn it back on! Turn it back on!

25:55.554 --> 25:56.889
OK. What's wrong?

26:03.437 --> 26:04.396
[Murphy] He's alive.

26:05.147 --> 26:06.148
This kid's alive.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.652
OK. What do we do?

26:11.195 --> 26:12.821
Well, we can't just disconnect him.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.823
Well, I'm gonna find Warren and 10K

26:14.907 --> 26:17.034
and see if they maybe found
a different power source.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.843
Look for anything from 1982 forward.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.109
Easy peasy.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.696
Russian intercepts 1982 to 83.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.698
Chemtrail cover stories.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.785
Putin's lovers 1993 to 94.

27:04.915 --> 27:07.835
Three. Two. One. Go.

27:07.918 --> 27:10.420
-[machine rumbling]
-Over here. I got her fired up.

27:16.927 --> 27:22.641
Wow. Super high tech, circa 1979.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.184
What are we looking for?

27:24.268 --> 27:26.270
Anything Black Rainbow related.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.729
[object clatters on floor]

27:27.813 --> 27:29.439
-Sorry.
-This could take a while.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.242
10K?

27:41.910 --> 27:43.161
Warren?

27:59.219 --> 28:02.431
This is just about the time
something jumps out at you.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.853
[growling]

28:28.457 --> 28:30.167
Ah! Hammertime.

28:31.752 --> 28:32.628
Break it down.

28:39.426 --> 28:40.510
I can't do it.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.304
I can't see the numbers.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.015
I'm not in the dream.

28:52.064 --> 28:52.898
Hit me.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.733
-What?
-Hit me.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.444
Sometimes fighting triggers the dream.

28:59.321 --> 29:00.239
Hit me.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.287
Hit me.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.375
Harder.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.459
Hit me.

29:28.350 --> 29:31.687
One. One. One.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.522
N-O.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.655
Warren, wait! Your mask!

29:55.294 --> 29:56.128
[groans]

30:10.183 --> 30:11.393
We go now.

30:20.777 --> 30:24.239
Here's something in the list
of black budget defense programs.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.658
Everything's redacted
but the final budget numbers.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.662
You smell just like I remember.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.457
That scent kept me going for two years.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.334
Four point two billion dollars

30:35.417 --> 30:38.128
for a top secret program
called Black Rainbow.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.006
-Sounds like a lot of money.
-[kissing]

30:41.089 --> 30:43.717
-Is that a lot of money for 1982?
-Mm-hm.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.801
I don't know.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.303
I never had any.

30:46.386 --> 30:49.097
That is a lot of money for 1982.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.933
Of course these days
it wouldn't buy you a cup of coffee.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.854
[kissing]

30:57.105 --> 30:59.232
Here's some more docs,

30:59.316 --> 31:00.525
but they're all redacted.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.111
Baby,

31:03.195 --> 31:05.655
can we put the Apocalypse
on hold for a while?

31:05.739 --> 31:07.532
Uh...

31:07.616 --> 31:09.076
It'll be waiting for us.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.708
Did you miss me?

31:17.417 --> 31:19.836
I ached for you, baby.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.977
-Fourth strike weapon?
-Mm-hm.

31:36.061 --> 31:39.064
What the hell is a fourth strike weapon?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.608
Who's left to kill after the third strike?

31:42.651 --> 31:43.735
We are.

31:46.363 --> 31:47.572
All right.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.367
I'll go pull 1982 and 83.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.702
Anything fourth strike related.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.287
Got it.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.341
I couldn't find them.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.678
What the hell happened to you?

32:09.761 --> 32:12.556
Dude, there's a fungus among us.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.934
There you are.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.394
Where have you been?

32:18.103 --> 32:19.813
Collecting souvenirs.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.982
Well, you were right
about the solar chargers,

32:22.065 --> 32:24.818
but we also came across a little surprise.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.280
Who is it?

32:28.363 --> 32:30.615
It's Teller's kid. Andrew.

32:34.536 --> 32:35.829
[cooing]

32:35.912 --> 32:39.082
We have to get this information
over to Lieutenant Warren.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.297
-How's the Cincinnati Kid?
-[babbling]

32:46.506 --> 32:48.383
He cheats?

32:48.467 --> 32:51.386
Operation Bitemark has no idea
what they're walking into.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.264
Try scanning the low end
of the military frequencies.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.266
There aren't that many
working radios at this point.

32:56.349 --> 32:59.352
I'll just keep working the dials
until somebody hits me back.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.313
Delta X-ray Delta.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.523
Delta X-ray Delta.
It's burned into my brain.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.025
Delta X-ray Delta!

33:05.775 --> 33:07.444
Nana, will you get him a snack?

33:10.947 --> 33:13.450
Delta X-ray Delta.
Calling Delta X-ray Delta.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.202
This is Kaya-In-The-Sky-A. Over.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.370
Lieutenant Warren, are you there?

33:18.538 --> 33:20.790
I have important information. Over.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.060
Is he alive?

33:40.143 --> 33:41.603
If you can call it that.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.856
Despite of having a hole in his head
you could drive a model train through.

33:53.823 --> 33:54.950
I'm sorry.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.076
Is this it?

33:56.576 --> 33:58.161
Is this why Teller sent you here?

34:05.961 --> 34:06.962
No.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.756
This is.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.258
What the hell are we supposed
to do with that?

34:11.341 --> 34:12.634
I don't know yet!

34:15.512 --> 34:16.721
He should have been mercied.

34:16.805 --> 34:19.683
Maybe Teller thought
he could bring him back, cure him.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.769
Well, sometimes the Zompocalypse
has a way of ruining the best laid plans.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.439
Right now, we got
to get power to the transmitter.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.358
You're not gonna
unplug the little guy, are you?

34:29.025 --> 34:30.735
I can divert power
from half the batteries.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.779
That should leave him
enough power to stay alive.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.906
Or whatever he is.

34:41.997 --> 34:43.039
Do it.

34:48.336 --> 34:51.339
Delta X-ray Delta.
This is Citizen Z. Do you copy?

34:53.133 --> 34:56.386
Delta X-ray Delta.
This is Citizen Z. Do you copy?

34:56.469 --> 34:57.804
Murphy?

34:58.597 --> 34:59.639
Doc?

35:00.181 --> 35:01.725
Addy, are you there?

35:01.808 --> 35:03.435
Warren, do you copy?

35:04.311 --> 35:07.981
This is Citizen Z. We have vital
information regarding Black Rainbow.

35:08.064 --> 35:11.901
Repeat. We have vital information
regarding Black Rainbow.

35:14.237 --> 35:17.032
[Citizen Z] <i>Delta X-ray Delta.
This is Citizen Z. Do you copy?</i>

35:17.115 --> 35:18.033
That's it. Go back.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.910
-Yeah, that's Citizen Z all right.
<i>-</i>[Warren]<i> Copy you.</i>

35:21.453 --> 35:23.455
Citizen Z, this is Warren. Repeat.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.457
Citizen Z, this is Warren. Do you copy?

35:26.374 --> 35:28.126
<i>Copy you, Warren. This is Citizen Z.</i>

35:28.209 --> 35:30.587
-How are you, Lieutenant?
-We're alive.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.505
Most of us anyway.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.967
Bad signal, low battery. Talk fast.

35:36.051 --> 35:37.427
OK, I'll get right to it.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.346
Kaya's been drilling
down into deep storage

35:39.429 --> 35:41.181
looking for anything Black Rainbow.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.223
What'd you find?

35:42.307 --> 35:44.351
We had intruders here, Zona soldiers.

35:44.434 --> 35:47.228
<i>They copied all the Black Rainbow files
then wiped the servers.</i>

35:47.312 --> 35:49.606
Dammit. Why?

35:49.689 --> 35:52.025
They also used a secure NSA hardline

35:52.108 --> 35:54.986
to spoof their way
into the NORAD computers.

35:55.070 --> 35:58.406
They logged onto the administrator account
for a defunct weapons program.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.741
Guess what it was called.

35:59.824 --> 36:00.992
Black Rainbow?

36:04.954 --> 36:06.498
What is Black Rainbow?

36:06.581 --> 36:08.041
[Kaya] <i>You won't believe...</i>

36:10.001 --> 36:10.877
Hello?

36:10.960 --> 36:12.003
We're out of juice.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.466
I need this radio. We need this radio.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.597
[Doc] Chief, if we take any more batteries
from that kid,

36:22.681 --> 36:24.140
his life support is gonna fail.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.731
What if he can be saved?

36:34.776 --> 36:36.611
My parents left me.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.280
Left me locked in the trunk
of a car, trying to save me.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.117
But they never came back, I mean not...

36:42.867 --> 36:44.035
not alive.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.955
I should be dead.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.331
But somebody found me.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.418
We found him.
Maybe we're supposed to save him.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.421
We don't know how to save him.

36:54.963 --> 36:57.257
Well, we can't leave him here
for all eternity.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.179
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

37:04.431 --> 37:05.765
But not like that.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.601
His mother's dead over there.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.478
His father's dead on Zona.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.109
No one's coming for him.

37:16.192 --> 37:19.988
He is trapped in amber
like a bug that can't die.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.782
If it were me,

37:22.866 --> 37:24.492
if it were my son,

37:26.995 --> 37:27.996
I'd want mercy.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.456
Uh...

37:29.539 --> 37:30.749
Sergeant,

37:30.832 --> 37:32.542
sometimes in war,

37:32.625 --> 37:34.669
we have to make hard decisions.

37:36.880 --> 37:40.216
The needs of the many
outweigh the needs of one.

37:45.430 --> 37:48.683
Divert the power to the radio.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.060
That's an order.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.745
[Sergeant cries]

38:12.665 --> 38:13.958
-It's OK.
-I'm sorry.

38:14.042 --> 38:14.876
Go.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.594
I give you mercy.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.774
[Warren] Do you copy, Citizen Z?

38:37.857 --> 38:41.277
Citizen Z, this is Lieutenant Warren.
Do you copy?

38:42.320 --> 38:44.572
[Kaya] <i>Copy you, Lieutenant Warren,
loud and clear.</i>

38:44.656 --> 38:46.282
Talk fast. We're losing our charge.

38:46.366 --> 38:47.784
What do you know about the Black Rainbow?

38:47.867 --> 38:49.953
<i>Zona soldiers hacked
the Black Rainbow files</i>

38:50.036 --> 38:52.080
and then logged into a server
at an air force base

38:52.163 --> 38:53.206
in Quantico, Virginia.

38:53.289 --> 38:56.209
We believe they changed the launch codes
for Black Rainbow.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.378
[Warren] <i>Launch codes?
Launch codes for what?</i>

38:58.461 --> 39:01.214
Black Rainbow is a biological
weapon of mass destruction.

39:02.257 --> 39:03.925
It's a fourth strike weapon

39:04.008 --> 39:06.302
meant to kill anything left
after an all-out nuclear war.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.556
The Reset.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.559
That's what Zona was working on.

39:12.642 --> 39:15.144
Killing everything so that
they could start over.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.898
That must be what the Black Rainbow is.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.942
I thought you said these folks were nice.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.485
Yeah, for billionaires.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.988
You said that
they changed the launch codes.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.156
-Can we change them back?
-Not remotely.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.324
After they changed the code,

39:28.408 --> 39:30.743
they sent the server a command
to disable itself.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.412
We got to stop that launch.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.415
That's what my dream is about.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.716
There is another way to change the codes.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.719
I found it
in a training manual they missed. It's...

39:47.802 --> 39:48.970
a little tricky.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.889
We can handle tricky.

39:50.972 --> 39:55.518
The codes can be changed manually
on the control panel at the launch site.

39:55.602 --> 39:57.979
Well, that's gonna be tricky.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.731
That's not the tricky part.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.400
You need the President's thumbprint

40:02.483 --> 40:04.777
to verify you have clearance
to change the codes.

40:05.361 --> 40:10.450
<i>Do you copy? You must have the thumbprint
of the President of the United States</i>

40:10.533 --> 40:12.952
to change the codes. Do you copy?

40:15.371 --> 40:16.372
Copy.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.166
Over and out.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.506
Looks like...

40:27.216 --> 40:28.593
we're going to Washington.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.195
Well at least they'll be together now.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.781
Do you think they care?

40:50.531 --> 40:51.616
No.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.619
But I do.

41:15.723 --> 41:18.309
[soft rock music]

42:07.650 --> 42:09.193
It's a beautiful sunset.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.783
It's only beautiful
if someone's there to watch it.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.621
[music continues]
