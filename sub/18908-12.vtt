into the Greatest Day.

[drone warbling]

00:15.083 --> 00:16.417
- You can do something
with the gauntlet?

00:16.450 --> 00:19.187
- We have someone who
understands the alien interface.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.221
Who took it?

00:20.254 --> 00:21.489
- A group called the Red Hand.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.690
- Bram Bowman.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.757
- Thank you

00:23.791 --> 00:25.493
for your service in the war.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.161
- An attack on the Green Zone.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.329
It was a massacre.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.431
- The Red Hand
are your friends?

00:30.464 --> 00:32.566
- Everything that we built
was just set on fire.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.169
- Can we trust Alcala
to respond appropriately?

00:35.203 --> 00:36.304
- Of course not.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.839
- Which means
that we need leverage.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.775
I might know a way inside.

[indistinct chatter]

01:09.837 --> 01:13.607
- You boys get your story
buttoned up?

01:13.641 --> 01:15.676
- Actually, I was thinking
on telling them

01:15.709 --> 01:17.845
what really happened.

01:17.878 --> 01:21.115
- And why would you go
and do something like that?

01:21.149 --> 01:23.184
- You ever stop
and wonder how we got here?

01:23.217 --> 01:24.452
- [scoffs]

01:24.485 --> 01:26.820
We got here because
we took the money.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.756
There ain't nothing
wrong with that.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.792
- I didn't go private
for a paycheck.

01:31.825 --> 01:35.196
Just couldn't remember why
I signed up anymore.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.898
- So now you want to
go to an Iraqi prison

01:37.931 --> 01:40.668
because some dumb-ass
on your team got trigger-happy?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.915
- Good game.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.185
- B.

Don't talk to that suit

02:27.681 --> 02:29.517
- I'm here for
your incident report.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.556
Sign here.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.327
- What's that?

02:39.360 --> 02:41.195
- Your sworn affidavit
that you and your men

02:41.229 --> 02:43.331
fired in self-defense.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.732
We'll get you
through the checkpoint

02:44.765 --> 02:45.866
into Kuwait this afternoon.

02:45.899 --> 02:49.237
These are
commercial tickets home.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.906
- Home?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.375
- We have to get
your team out of here

02:54.408 --> 02:56.510
in case the locals
start demanding interviews.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.613
It's company policy.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.383
- The locals
should be asking questions.

03:05.253 --> 03:08.489
We screwed up.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.324
- Nobody in
Baghdad or Washington

03:10.358 --> 03:12.860
wants this to be a problem.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.596
So don't make it a problem.

You want to

Amnesty International.

out of this goddamn country.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.930
including
four department heads,

04:22.963 --> 04:24.498
and even worse,

04:24.532 --> 04:25.866
an ambassador from the IGA.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.669
How do you think I am?

04:28.702 --> 04:29.970
- You're gonna survive this.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.805
- Only if
the people around me

04:31.839 --> 04:33.474
remain loyal.

- You know I'll stand by you.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.311
- Do I?

04:37.345 --> 04:39.980
Because I remember asking you
to get rid of that girlfriend.

04:40.013 --> 04:43.016
Instead, she walks an IGA
security team into a trap.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.519
- I'm getting rid of her.
- Why is it so hard?

04:45.553 --> 04:47.555
All you have to do
is snap your fingers.

04:47.588 --> 04:51.392
- She's got a son.
- Not yours.

04:51.425 --> 04:56.330
- I just want to make sure
the kid's in a safe place.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.732
I'm taking care of it...

04:58.766 --> 05:00.868
this morning.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.070
We're gonna survive this.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.714
- Helena is the real problem.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.616
- Which is why
we need to make the case

05:15.649 --> 05:17.718
to the folks at IGA
that she's the cause

05:17.751 --> 05:19.587
of our recent issues.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.723
If we had been left alone to
initiate the Seattle Protocol,

05:22.756 --> 05:24.057
none of this
would have happened.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.893
You know that.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.761
- Do you know someone
at the IGA?

05:27.795 --> 05:28.896
- I do.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.734
- Nolan.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.904
We all have our needs.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.939
But perhaps you should be
a little more selective

05:38.972 --> 05:41.909
about who enters your bed.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.944
- I'm planning on it.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.520
- [sighs]

05:57.991 --> 05:59.793
- You haven't called me.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.095
I'm trying not
to take it personally.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.532
- I don't have anything.

06:07.034 --> 06:10.003
- Are you telling me that
despite the shocking massacre

06:10.037 --> 06:11.839
that just occurred
in this bloc,

06:11.872 --> 06:13.907
you have nothing
to report?

06:13.941 --> 06:15.609
- It's all just noise.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.145
I didn't want
to bother you.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.823
- Tell me
about Nolan Burgess.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.091
- The Deputy Proxy.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.894
- You know, a man can only
play dumb so many times

06:33.927 --> 06:36.196
before everyone
starts to believe it.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.899
You just oversaw
a security failure

Do you want
to go down with the ship,

passed to the Resistance

had come to our house,

07:50.938 --> 07:52.506
found you and Hudson?

07:52.540 --> 07:56.043
This is just until
we can clean up the bloc.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.046

Look, it's an honor,
actually.

get to their leader.

the gauntlet?

- I'm not leaving the bloc
without it.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.203
- Then we need to negotiate

08:56.236 --> 08:57.971

have a backup plan.

something we need.

outside their group.

sister of a Resistance leader?

13:58.972 --> 14:02.409
- Yes. And this Resistance
leader used the relationship

14:02.442 --> 14:06.980
to lead an IGA security team
into a trap.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.382
- Well, bad optics,
obviously,

14:09.416 --> 14:12.019
but how does this
help us with Alcala?

14:13.586 --> 14:16.523
- A file containing
classified population data

14:16.556 --> 14:18.959
was downloaded
from Nolan's house.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.260
It passed to the Resistance,

14:20.293 --> 14:22.295
and they've been using it
as propaganda.

14:22.329 --> 14:26.433
Nolan's either complicit
or careless.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.301
- So we can squeeze him.
- Exactly.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.038
And Nolan knows where all the
bodies are buried in this bloc.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.673
We'll turn him and then
explain that his only chance

14:33.706 --> 14:36.309
is to give up something
on Alcala.

14:36.343 --> 14:39.012
- Well, it's nice to see
that you didn't lose

14:39.046 --> 14:40.981
your gift
for political maneuvering

14:41.014 --> 14:42.315
while down in that camp.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.684
- I'm just trying
to serve the Authority

14:44.717 --> 14:46.419
and you, of course.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.058
- Of course.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.400
- That leaked file--

15:00.433 --> 15:03.036
the Resistance
has been twisting information

15:03.070 --> 15:06.173
to make some
inflammatory claims.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.674
- Such as?

15:07.707 --> 15:10.210
- That the attrition rate
in the bloc is rising so rapidly

15:10.243 --> 15:12.712
that Los Angeles
will be empty in two years.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.514
- We'll just push back
with our own propaganda

15:14.547 --> 15:16.383
once we have Alcala
under our thumb.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.218
- Is it true?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.953
Uh, when I was proxy,

15:19.987 --> 15:22.589
I was told that
the escalation was temporary,

15:22.622 --> 15:26.093
that we needed to populate
new facilities,

15:26.126 --> 15:30.197
but eventually the bloc's
numbers would stabilize.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.232
- Don't play innocent.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.700
It doesn't suit you.

15:35.702 --> 15:42.709
*

15:53.720 --> 15:56.523
- You think she's
actually gonna show up?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.225
- Why not?

15:58.258 --> 16:01.361
As far as she knows,
she holds all the cards.

16:02.762 --> 16:06.266
- Behind the trees,
50 meters right of your mark.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.001
- Got 'em.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.436
Somebody's coming.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.278
- You wanted to meet?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.312
Well, here I am.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.315
- You have something
of mine--

16:22.349 --> 16:25.585
an object
in a lead-lined box.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.287
I want it back.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.022
- The RAP artifact.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.690
- I paid a price
for that thing.

16:30.723 --> 16:34.594
We brought down holy hell
on our heads by stealing it,

16:34.627 --> 16:36.796
and it killed
one of my men.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.331
- Then why do you
want it back?

16:38.365 --> 16:40.133
- We made contact
with a resistance group

16:40.167 --> 16:41.434
beyond the wall.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.337
They have scientists
who can do something with it.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.340
- This is an opportunity
to make a real difference.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.745
- No.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.315
- Why not?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.350
- It might be useful to us.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.319
- Like it or not,
you're a part of something

16:59.352 --> 17:00.353
bigger than yourself.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.455
- Our group is successful

17:02.489 --> 17:05.192
because we don't work
with people like you.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.626
- Bogeys behind the ridge.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.261
- Your problem is
you don't even see

17:08.295 --> 17:10.230
the compromises
that you've made.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.166
You work with people
within the Occupation.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.268
- You've got hostiles
trying to flank you.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.503
Get ready to pull out.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.338
- Sources.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.807
- Yes, and you are corrupted
by your contact with them.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.642
- Only an amateur
would say that.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.211
- I'm proud
to be an amateur.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.246
A million professionals
were wiped out

17:26.279 --> 17:27.647
the day of the Arrival,

17:27.680 --> 17:30.483
and you still think
those tactics are going to work?

17:30.517 --> 17:34.121
You can't even get a handful
of people to follow you.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.656
Meanwhile, I'm turning away
volunteers.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.191
- Then why did you kill
Hennessey?

17:38.225 --> 17:39.359
- Because
he would have flipped

17:39.392 --> 17:41.394
the moment
the Occupation found him.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.662
- He was a good man
doing good work.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.231
- Really?

17:44.264 --> 17:46.399
And what did he do
to change the bloc?

17:46.433 --> 17:48.835
- He did a lot more than
killing women and children

17:48.868 --> 17:50.137
in the Green Zone.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.604
- They were collaborators.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.141
And if you shed
a single tear for them,

17:54.174 --> 17:55.408
so are you.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.411
[tense music]

17:58.445 --> 18:01.148
*

18:01.181 --> 18:02.615
- They're coming up
on our position.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.785
Either we fall back,
or I start shooting.

18:05.818 --> 18:09.822
- This was supposed
to be a parlay.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.726
Tell your people
to fall back...

18:13.760 --> 18:15.662
or we can all die here.

18:15.695 --> 18:22.702
*

18:32.445 --> 18:35.282
That woman is a plague.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.151
She'll burn this bloc down
without a second thought.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.420
- She lost a child.
- Exactly...

18:40.453 --> 18:42.289
which is why she'll keep
provoking the Occupation

18:42.322 --> 18:43.723
till eventually
they go nuclear,

18:43.756 --> 18:45.825
which is probably
what she wants.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.295
- So what do we do?

18:48.328 --> 18:51.364
- Take back the gauntlet...

18:51.398 --> 18:53.300
and wipe them all out.

19:00.240 --> 19:00.473
.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.040
- Alan, always a pleasure.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.677
Please, have a seat.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.580
- Forgive me if I cut
straight to the point.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.317
I just learned
about a certain file

19:10.350 --> 19:13.620
that apparently disappeared
from this very house.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.389
This situation has raised
certain unpleasant questions

19:16.423 --> 19:17.757
with Homeland, of course.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.193
They're ready to launch
a full investigation.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.594
- Unless I play ball.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.531
Hmm?

19:24.564 --> 19:25.932
Unbelievable.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.535
I save your ass,
and this is how you repay me--

19:28.568 --> 19:30.670
with some clumsy
blackmail attempt?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.472
- At least
I didn't promise you

19:32.505 --> 19:34.341
a level-three job
in the Authority

19:34.374 --> 19:35.675
and a house
in the Green Zone.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.477
- You know what
your problem is, Alan?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.778
You know why
you failed as proxy?

19:38.811 --> 19:40.380
You're just too damn petty.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.549
Yes, I might have dated
the wrong woman,

19:42.582 --> 19:44.484
but that situation
has been handled.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.686
I expect her
to sign a full confession

19:46.719 --> 19:48.655
before she gets shipped off
to the Factory.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.957
- Now she'll be able
to reconnect with your wife.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.393
It's interesting
how all your women

19:53.426 --> 19:55.528
wind up in space.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.765
- [chuckles awkwardly]

19:58.798 --> 20:00.367
Would you excuse me, Alan?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.968
I've just got a mountain
of paperwork here.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.571
- Oh, of course.
- You understand, yeah.

20:09.276 --> 20:12.379
- Why are you loyal
to Alcala?

20:12.412 --> 20:15.682
He wouldn't stand up for you.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.251
- Helena's been weakened.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.553
At some point,
you got to place a bet, right?

20:20.587 --> 20:22.522
- See, that's exactly
where you're wrong.

20:22.555 --> 20:26.559
The moment you place a bet,
you're exposed.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.704
- Were you able to follow her?
- Yep.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.941
Our little bumblebee
tracked her all the way home.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.410
- A theater?

20:43.443 --> 20:45.545
- Yeah.
- Not a bad place for a hideout.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.946
Lots of entrances and exits.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.981
- Good job.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.286
- I got to tell you,
there's a lot of people

20:53.320 --> 20:54.821
coming in and out of here.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.557
- How many?

20:57.590 --> 20:58.725
- Like, a lot.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.728
[dramatic music]

21:06.833 --> 21:08.067
- You're back.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.802
- I need you to find
the Bowman sister,

21:09.836 --> 21:11.604
the one who was banging
Nolan Burgess.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.843
You know where she is.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.415
[footsteps approach,
door opens]

21:24.751 --> 21:26.719
This is no way
to treat a lady.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.755
Unbind her immediately.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.929
Miss Kenner,
I'm so glad I found you.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.332
I'm horrified
at the outrageous way

21:39.366 --> 21:40.800
that you've been treated.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.735
- You can help me?
- Of course.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.738
I'm here to make sure that
your side of the story is told.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.841
- I signed a confession.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.478
- This confession?

21:51.511 --> 21:54.347
Seems like a whole lot
of nonsense to me.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.716
How could an upstanding
woman like yourself

21:56.749 --> 22:01.354
be solely responsible
for these kinds of crimes?

22:01.388 --> 22:03.490
- They said
I had to sign it...

22:03.523 --> 22:05.358
to keep my son safe.

22:05.392 --> 22:08.528
- They don't have the power
to keep your son safe, but I do.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.800
I can see why you
were attracted to Nolan.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.502
He's smart, handsome,

22:15.535 --> 22:17.404
but he has the wrong
kind of ambition.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.572
And it's going to destroy him

22:19.606 --> 22:21.974
and maybe even the whole bloc,

22:22.008 --> 22:24.411
unless he's stopped.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.645
- And you're different?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.580
- I'm here to help you.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.416
- No.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.050
You're here to help yourself.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.721
- Perhaps.

22:36.689 --> 22:41.027
But unlike Nolan
and his friends,

22:41.060 --> 22:43.496
I keep my promises.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.836
- What do I have to do?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.471
- Just work with me.

22:51.504 --> 22:52.839
And in exchange,
I'll protect your son

22:52.872 --> 22:54.774
and keep you from going
to the Factory.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.747
Thank you.

23:00.780 --> 23:04.717
I'll send someone
to take your statement.

23:04.751 --> 23:05.518
Just remember,

23:05.552 --> 23:07.687
the more you can give me
on Nolan,

23:07.720 --> 23:09.121
the more I can help you.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.424
- Fine.

23:11.458 --> 23:14.561
I need to know something.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.697
The Greatest Day...

23:17.730 --> 23:20.433
all the promises they made.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.569
Is it real?

23:25.137 --> 23:28.841
- No.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.811
- And my son?

23:31.844 --> 23:33.680
Is there really a camp?

23:33.713 --> 23:35.482
- That's real.

23:35.515 --> 23:39.486
And at least he'll be trained
for what's coming.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.154
I'm sorry you picked
the wrong guy.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.860
[door opens]

23:47.894 --> 23:50.129
[door closes]

23:50.162 --> 23:53.566
- Morgan was able to pull off
a flyby with the drone.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.502
They have barracks
for their foot soldiers

23:55.535 --> 23:56.603
on the first floor.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.004
Headquarters
is up these stairs--

23:58.037 --> 24:00.106
only Karen
and a few key advisors

24:00.139 --> 24:01.641
are allowed access.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.142
They keep valuables in here.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.778
There's the box
with the gauntlet.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.780
- It was too dangerous
to get the drone any closer.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.148
- These are bad odds.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.950
We really gonna risk
our lives for that thing?

24:10.983 --> 24:13.553
- That thing is
the game changer.

24:13.586 --> 24:14.854
- Okay, why?

24:19.526 --> 24:21.594
- We have a RAP.

24:21.628 --> 24:25.832
*

24:25.865 --> 24:28.568
- What?
- One of them defected.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.503
It doesn't believe in
what the rest of them are doing.

24:30.537 --> 24:33.873
Our RAP just needs the gauntlet
to tap into their communication.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.842
It's the only piece
we're missing.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.710
- We got to get it back.
- Okay, but how?

24:37.744 --> 24:39.846
They probably outnumber us
ten to one.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.548
- Their soldiers
might be fanatics,

24:41.581 --> 24:43.149
but they're also
untrained amateurs.

24:43.182 --> 24:46.986
We can beat them
if we fight them on our terms.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.721
Maybe we use
the tracking device

24:48.755 --> 24:50.590
that BB removed
from the gauntlet?

24:50.623 --> 24:52.058
We toss it
into their hideout,

24:52.091 --> 24:53.860
wait for the drones
to respond,

24:53.893 --> 24:55.562
and grab the gauntlet
during the chaos.

24:55.595 --> 24:56.796
- Target's too exposed.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.664
We'll never get
out of there alive.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.866
- Then we do it
the old-fashioned way--

24:59.899 --> 25:01.233
hit 'em hard and fast.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.870
*

25:03.903 --> 25:05.672
- What do you think?

25:05.705 --> 25:09.108
*

25:09.141 --> 25:11.277
- I think our kids
need a future.

25:14.146 --> 25:17.283
[knock at door

25:18.785 --> 25:20.252
Need to talk to you.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.728
Your father and I have
to go do something.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.965
And it's dangerous.

25:32.999 --> 25:36.268
- You're going
after the Red Hand?

25:36.302 --> 25:39.238
- Yes.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.272
- Because of me.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.974
- No.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.611
No, because...

25:44.644 --> 25:47.914
they have something we need.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.116
That woman, Noa,

25:50.149 --> 25:54.253
she's gonna take our family
someplace safe.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.656
But we have to do this first.

26:00.660 --> 26:03.129
- And what if
you don't come back?

26:03.162 --> 26:08.000
*

26:08.034 --> 26:12.672
- Then you need to take care
of your sister and brother.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.273
Go to Aunt Maddie,

26:14.306 --> 26:17.744
ask for her help.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.379
- [scoffs]
She won't listen to me.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.848
- She will.

26:21.881 --> 26:22.982
She's...

26:23.015 --> 26:25.685
[scoffs]

26:25.718 --> 26:27.987
She's still family.

26:28.020 --> 26:33.760
*

26:33.793 --> 26:35.762
We'll be back tonight.

26:35.795 --> 26:41.768
*

26:41.801 --> 26:42.902
I love you.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.074
- Hey, Mom.

26:50.409 --> 26:51.978
Be careful.

- You okay?

30:03.235 --> 30:05.905
- I'm fine.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.940
Better keep it moving.

30:07.974 --> 30:14.981
*

30:24.023 --> 30:26.959
- Is she...?

30:26.993 --> 30:28.127
- Yeah.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.529
- We're being overrun.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.231
- We've got the target.
Get out of there.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.465
- She can't--she can't be dead.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.134
She never told us
where her base was.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.536
She never told us anything!
- We got to go.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.072

30:40.106 --> 30:43.142
- Hurry up.
They're downstairs.

Go!

I'm out of ammunition!
- Go! I'll cover you!

31:28.187 --> 31:29.621
- We move together!

31:29.655 --> 31:31.023
- It's too hot!
I'll buy you time!

31:31.057 --> 31:32.358
- We move together!

31:32.391 --> 31:33.960
- You have a family!

31:33.993 --> 31:36.228
Get out of here!

31:38.230 --> 31:41.233
[gunfire continues]

31:48.574 --> 31:49.608

31:49.641 --> 31:51.077
Broussard?

31:51.110 --> 31:52.979
- He's coming.
We got to go.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.213
I'm out.

[keys jingle, clatter]

33:08.054 --> 33:09.488
- Hello, Nolan.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.726
- What are you doing here?
- I'm enjoying a drink.

33:14.760 --> 33:18.497
- You should leave.
- Before you even hear my offer?

33:18.530 --> 33:21.033
- Alan, I told you,
I'm standing with Alcala.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.702
- I remember, but that was
before I got a chance to chat

33:23.735 --> 33:26.038
with the delightful
Madeline Kenner.

33:26.072 --> 33:29.108
She had all sorts of things
to say about you.

33:29.141 --> 33:32.344
Hell truly hath no fury...

33:32.378 --> 33:34.580
- Alan, she signed
a full confession.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.315
- Under duress.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.450
But she has subsequently
decided to elaborate.

33:38.484 --> 33:41.453
For example, she explained
that you played a direct role

33:41.487 --> 33:44.790
in getting a certain file
to the Resistance.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.492
- That's a lie.
- Perhaps.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.760
But consider it
from the IGA's perspective.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.729
They aren't gonna
want to take the risk

33:50.762 --> 33:54.333
that you can be trusted,
not after this.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.502
- [stutters]

33:56.535 --> 33:58.337
What do you want?

33:58.370 --> 34:00.506
- Same thing
I've always wanted--

34:00.539 --> 34:03.142
to protect this bloc.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.745
[dramatic music]

34:06.778 --> 34:09.581
You give me what I need
to take down Alcala,

34:09.615 --> 34:12.584
in exchange,
Helena will push you

34:12.618 --> 34:14.453
as the new proxy,

34:14.486 --> 34:18.757
and your ex-girlfriend problem
will simply disappear.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.696
- What's your angle?

34:24.730 --> 34:28.100
- I didn't enjoy my time
as a front man.

34:28.134 --> 34:29.601
But I think I could be
very effective

34:29.635 --> 34:32.104
behind the throne.

34:32.138 --> 34:37.376
*

34:37.409 --> 34:38.844
- To old friendships...
[glasses clink]

34:38.877 --> 34:41.213
And new roads.
- Mm.

34:41.247 --> 34:45.751
*

34:45.784 --> 34:50.222
- Where are we gonna
rendezvous with Broussard?

34:50.256 --> 34:52.524
- He's not coming.

34:52.558 --> 34:57.263
*

34:57.296 --> 34:58.664
We were about to be overrun.

34:58.697 --> 35:02.668
He stayed behind to hold them
off as long as possible.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.471
- He's not dead.

35:05.504 --> 35:12.478

- We have to move.
Let's go.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.490
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

35:24.523 --> 35:27.593
- Someone attacks the Red Hand,
kills their leader,

35:27.626 --> 35:30.562
and then lures most of
their soldiers into an ambush.

35:30.596 --> 35:33.632
- The attackers used this
to summon our drones.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.368
That's from
the Host's gauntlet.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.738
- Broussard.

35:39.771 --> 35:43.442
I'm not a man who generally
looks a gift horse in the mouth,

35:43.475 --> 35:47.913
but why would Broussard
attack the Red Hand?

35:47.946 --> 35:50.482
What did he want?

35:50.516 --> 35:52.384
- I don't know.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.386
- Show me the roof.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.493
[footsteps approaching]

36:01.527 --> 36:03.495
- Sir, the Governor-General
is here for you.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.331
- I can see that.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.698
- Get out.

36:06.732 --> 36:10.469
So you have been falsifying
your reports to the IGA?

36:10.502 --> 36:11.770
- [chuckles]

36:11.803 --> 36:14.473
That's an absurd accusation.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.575
- Well, this appears
to be an edit

36:16.608 --> 36:18.477
made in your handwriting,

36:18.510 --> 36:22.648
cutting the terrorist incident
report in half.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.516
And that's only
the tip of the iceberg.

36:24.550 --> 36:27.719
I have everything.

36:27.753 --> 36:29.488
- You got this
from Nolan Burgess.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.589
- Mm-hmm.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.458
He seems to want your job,

36:32.491 --> 36:34.660
which shows a certain lack
of imagination,

36:34.693 --> 36:38.397
given that Los Angeles is going
through proxies like firewood.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.402
- What are you gonna do?

36:43.435 --> 36:45.003
- Well, that depends.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.406
You haven't been
a very good listener.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.644
- I can change that.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.817
- Well...

36:58.850 --> 37:01.620
Los Angeles needs
to project stability,

37:01.653 --> 37:04.690
so you will remain
as proxy...

37:04.723 --> 37:07.926
but in name only.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.696
People I trust
will run the bloc,

37:10.729 --> 37:13.965
and you will rubber-stamp
all of their decisions.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.704
- [sighs]
What about Nolan Burgess?

37:18.737 --> 37:20.572
- Like I said,

37:20.606 --> 37:23.609
the people I trust
are in charge.

37:23.642 --> 37:27.313
[door opens, closes]

37:27.346 --> 37:28.614
- Yeah, I know what time
it is over there.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.516
I don't care.
Wake him up.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.517
It's urgent.

37:31.550 --> 37:34.052
[knock at door]

37:34.085 --> 37:36.822
Just have him look at the file
as soon as possible, okay?

37:39.358 --> 37:40.792
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

37:40.826 --> 37:42.561
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh.
- Up against the wall!

37:42.594 --> 37:43.929
- Go, go!
- Now! Let's move!

37:49.601 --> 37:49.868
.

37:49.901 --> 37:50.369
- You have ten minutes

37:51.870 --> 37:53.439
to pack whatever personal items
you want.

37:53.472 --> 37:54.506
- Where's Nolan?

37:54.540 --> 37:57.309
My son--
I sent him to a camp.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.644
How do I get him back?

37:58.677 --> 38:01.313
[dramatic music]

38:01.347 --> 38:02.648
- Nine minutes.

38:02.681 --> 38:09.688
*

38:35.046 --> 38:37.783
- What are we gonna do?

38:37.816 --> 38:40.919
Noa was
our point of contact.

38:40.952 --> 38:44.756
- We're gonna get
out of this bloc.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.859
Then we'll figure it out.

38:47.893 --> 38:50.128
- We don't know anything.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.830
We don't know where to go.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.933
We don't know
if it's safe.

38:54.966 --> 38:59.037
- It's better than staying here
and waiting for what's coming.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.039
[loud thud]

39:05.577 --> 39:06.878
- It's me.

[door closes, lock clicks]

39:21.560 --> 39:24.396
- What happened?

39:24.430 --> 39:27.433
- I got the Hands
to chase me onto the roof.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.770
When they pinned me down,

39:31.803 --> 39:33.872
I dropped the tracking device.

39:36.475 --> 39:39.077
The drones showed up
and opened fire...

39:39.110 --> 39:41.813

39:41.847 --> 39:43.815
Shredded everything.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.853
- Except you.

39:49.688 --> 39:50.756
- Yeah.

39:53.825 --> 39:56.795
One of them came down
closer than you are right now,

39:56.828 --> 39:58.930
just stared at me.

39:58.964 --> 40:02.100
And then it just flew away.

40:02.133 --> 40:05.003
- That happened to me...

40:05.036 --> 40:07.906
coming back
from Santa Monica.

40:09.908 --> 40:13.812
- Maybe it has something to do
with that, uh, file

40:13.845 --> 40:16.715
that you found
in the Blackjack's car?

40:16.748 --> 40:20.886
Maybe you're both
on some kind of special list?

*

40:25.624 --> 40:28.627
[ship whirring]

40:32.864 --> 40:34.132
- To Nolan,

40:34.165 --> 40:37.869
who shot for the moon
and finally got it.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.872
- You're bad.

40:40.906 --> 40:44.009
- Whoever eliminated the
Red Hand did us a huge favor.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.144
Now we just need to rein in
the Greatest Day

40:46.177 --> 40:48.880
and let the people in
the middle, the normal people,

40:48.914 --> 40:50.716
take control of their bloc.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.984
- I hope you're right.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.954
- There's a call
for you, ma'am, from Davos.

41:00.659 --> 41:01.893
- They're up early.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.496
Excuse me a moment.
- Of course.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.804
[device beeps]

41:12.838 --> 41:13.872
- This is Helena Goldwyn.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.507
- Governor-General,

41:15.541 --> 41:18.544
this is Sabine Arnuad,
the chief counsel.

41:18.577 --> 41:22.147
I'm afraid I have bad news.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.949
- I see.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.717
What is it?

41:25.751 --> 41:28.887
- We just received word
from our Hosts.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.589
The Los Angeles bloc

41:30.622 --> 41:32.991
has been scheduled
for total rendition.
