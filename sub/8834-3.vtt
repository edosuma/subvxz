14:34.333 --> 14:38.250
I am the only one
who says, "one more time."

14:38.333 --> 14:40.375
He's the one who said it.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.208
Him, him!

14:44.542 --> 14:48.834
Don't move, Kit, if they drag us away,
grab Molly and get!

14:48.917 --> 14:50.750
Baloo.

14:54.667 --> 14:58.834
The round furry pilot and the annoying
business lady.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.625
Wasn't she locked up?

15:01.291 --> 15:02.625
[Gibber whispering]

15:03.041 --> 15:05.709
Well, of course she must have escaped!

15:06.792 --> 15:08.041
Never mind.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.625
I hope you brought my stone.

15:10.709 --> 15:13.375
I need it to complete my plans.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.333
You seen any stone, Becky?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.208
What stone?

15:18.291 --> 15:20.917
Don't be the clever guy.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.291
You are not qualified.

15:22.917 --> 15:24.834
Wait. Where is the boy?

15:24.917 --> 15:26.250
Go fish.

15:26.333 --> 15:30.333
You'd risk your lives protecting
that filthy flea?

15:30.458 --> 15:31.875
Hey, lay off.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.917
He's a good kid.

15:35.875 --> 15:38.542
Hiya, gang. I'm back.

15:38.709 --> 15:40.959
Kit? What are you doing?

15:41.041 --> 15:42.417
Quiet, rudder rump.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.667
Rudder rump?

15:43.792 --> 15:46.166
Yo, captain. How did I do?

15:46.250 --> 15:48.458
What are you talking about,

15:48.583 --> 15:50.417
you juvenile delinquentywink?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.667
What you taught me.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.125
The old Karnage hustle.

15:55.583 --> 15:58.834
I pretended stealing the stone from you

15:58.917 --> 16:01.667
to finagle ransom money from Shere Khan.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.250
[Don Karnage] What ransom money?

16:04.333 --> 16:05.959
$100,000.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.125
Really?

16:07.208 --> 16:08.875
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

16:10.125 --> 16:11.917
I was going to steal it back

16:12.000 --> 16:13.500
and give you everything

16:13.583 --> 16:17.583
until they messed it up by grabbing them.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.250
You big ignoranomouses!

16:20.375 --> 16:22.709
I ought to hang you by your pinkies!

16:22.834 --> 16:24.208
[both] Sorry.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.208
Relax, captain.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.500
I bamboozled this bozo
into bringing me back.

16:29.583 --> 16:33.291
Kit, I thought we were pals.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.625
I thought you were, too.

16:35.709 --> 16:39.000
I was using the jerk to give me the stone.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.291
He fell for it.

16:45.917 --> 16:50.417
Very, very good. I like that.
Then you will not mind

16:50.500 --> 16:53.000
if I blast them!

16:59.125 --> 17:01.458
Ready, aim...

17:02.667 --> 17:06.250
Wait! Aren't you forgetting
something important?

17:07.834 --> 17:09.250
Hey, you're hurting Lucy.

17:09.333 --> 17:10.750
Aw, shut up.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.333
Mommy!

17:12.416 --> 17:15.916
Ooh. He is even mean to children.

17:18.541 --> 17:20.916
So, you like my plan?

17:21.000 --> 17:24.458
Son, you are a refreshing addition

17:24.541 --> 17:27.875
to my normally thick-headed group.

17:27.959 --> 17:31.041
How about we let these saps go?

17:31.125 --> 17:33.959
I never let anybody go.

17:34.041 --> 17:36.500
Then eat my gold dust.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.667
-Yeow!
-Aah!

17:39.333 --> 17:41.917
Shoot them... a lot!

17:42.000 --> 17:44.250
Perforate them, you pig heads!

17:46.583 --> 17:48.375
Uh-oh. Trouble.

17:53.417 --> 17:54.792
Worse trouble.

17:54.875 --> 17:56.750
[Rebecca yelling in fright]

18:08.792 --> 18:10.667
[panting] What about Kit?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.583
I can't shake these guys.

18:37.792 --> 18:40.250
I never wanted to use this.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.667
Hang on tight.

18:51.875 --> 18:55.959
Five... Four... Three... Two... One...

18:59.333 --> 19:01.166
What was that?

19:01.250 --> 19:02.709
Something I added.

19:02.917 --> 19:05.333
Use it too long, the engines overheat--

19:05.583 --> 19:07.375
boom boom, bye-bye.

19:07.458 --> 19:08.500
Baloo?

19:08.583 --> 19:09.750
Yeah?

19:09.834 --> 19:12.000
Let's do it again!

19:14.125 --> 19:17.250
Ah, so here you are.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.750
There.

19:19.834 --> 19:23.000
You are back with the pirates now.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.959
You did well, my puny <i>protégé </i>.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.542
Happy?

19:28.125 --> 19:29.750
Couldn't be happier.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.166
[Rebecca Cunningham] What's with you?

19:32.250 --> 19:35.208
You haven't said three words
the whole flight.

19:35.792 --> 19:36.750
Baloo!

19:36.834 --> 19:38.375
[car approaching]

19:39.417 --> 19:40.750
[yelping]

19:52.709 --> 19:56.041
Ah, so glad you could stop by.

19:56.125 --> 19:58.375
There are rules, you know.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.166
I make my own rules.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.458
Where's the stone?

20:04.542 --> 20:06.875
Before we tell you,

20:06.959 --> 20:09.834
what is this stone
everybody keeps talking about?

20:09.917 --> 20:11.375
Fair enough.

20:11.458 --> 20:12.417
Doctor...

20:12.500 --> 20:16.375
The stone is a sub electron amplifier

20:16.458 --> 20:18.083
which means it creates

20:18.166 --> 20:19.875
unlimited amounts of electricity.

20:19.959 --> 20:22.917
Enough to run all
of Mr. Khan's businesses.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.500
But we only created one stone and--

20:26.583 --> 20:28.458
Thank you, doctor.

20:28.709 --> 20:30.583
Now, where is it?

20:30.667 --> 20:33.834
We don't have it. Don Karnage does.

20:33.917 --> 20:37.333
I am displeased, Baloo.

20:37.417 --> 20:39.250
You've let me down.

20:39.333 --> 20:43.166
Don't tell me about being let down
because I'm an expert.

20:43.250 --> 20:47.083
Someone gets close,
then stabs you in the back.

20:47.166 --> 20:50.834
I'm sick of being used
and working for you!

20:51.083 --> 20:53.500
I'm sick of your stone.

20:53.583 --> 20:56.000
Just leave me alone!

20:58.083 --> 21:01.834
Hmm. A very emotional man.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.750
You're all dismissed.

21:03.834 --> 21:05.291
But, Mr. Khan--

21:05.375 --> 21:06.750
Good day.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.417
Baloo, where are you going?

21:12.500 --> 21:15.125
I'm out of here, sister.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.041
Maybe I'll try Louie's.

21:17.125 --> 21:20.375
-But that's my plane.
-Uh-uh.

21:20.458 --> 21:22.375
I own it now.

21:23.125 --> 21:25.625
To make it all fair and square,

21:25.709 --> 21:28.583
this gold ought to cover it.

21:31.542 --> 21:34.041
Don't go, Baloo.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.709
Sorry, cupcake.

21:35.792 --> 21:39.166
The sky's calling, and I'm gone.

21:39.250 --> 21:43.250
This isn't about the plane or stone
or even me. It's Kit.

21:43.333 --> 21:46.959
Are you the pirate den mother?

21:47.041 --> 21:50.417
It looks like he's betrayed us,

21:50.500 --> 21:53.291
but think with your heart, not your head.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.041
Forget it. From now on I fly solo.

22:16.583 --> 22:19.875
I just don't believe Kit's gone bad!
