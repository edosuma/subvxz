00:01.000 --> 00:01.400
 'Previously, on St Elsewhere...'

00:01.400 --> 00:03.800
 'Previously, on St Elsewhere...'
Nick Moats is up for a
parole hearing in a week.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.840
They'd like to know
if you'd go up there

00:05.840 --> 00:08.400
and testify over what
happened during the riot.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.200
We'll start looking for
prospective buyers ASAP.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.480
I suggest you start
looking for another job.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.400
Let's swing.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.760
I told you you'd hate me.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.760
I liked the sex.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Since the Mayor decided to sell
the hospital, he does as he pleases.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.960
            No reason to consult us.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.880
     We are lame-duck administrators.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.200
Daniel, Donald, wait a minute.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.640
Have you told Mark about who is
interested in buying the hospital?

01:59.640 --> 02:02.080
I left a message about the sale.
I didn't tell him who.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.400
Mark's been up in Peterborough,
his mother-in-law's funeral.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.400
Mark,
sorry to hear about Mrs Harper.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.880
She died unexpectedly?

02:08.880 --> 02:12.880
Someone using my return address
mailed Margaret a head in a box.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.880
I mean, pulled a real John the
Baptist. Scared her to death.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.040
     How is Ellen holding up?

02:19.040 --> 02:20.800
OK. By the way, I got your message.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.280
Morning, everybody.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.320
Well, if it isn't Josiah Bartlett.

02:24.320 --> 02:28.000
Who pried you out of your
           mahogany-panelled office?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.600
Boston General's
expanding operations.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.200
My board's thinking of
purchasing St Eligius.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.800
That is,
  after I give them my opinion.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.200
Looking forward to the 25-cent tour.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.760
I'll grab a Danish
              and meet you upstairs.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.160
He's making a grab for
my surgery department!

02:44.160 --> 02:47.520
Might be wise to stay on his good
side. We could be working for him.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.920
I am gone for a few lousy
days and you two sell me

02:49.920 --> 02:53.560
and this hospital down the river!

02:53.560 --> 02:57.560
Next car.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.280
Victor Ehrlich was
sniffing around for you.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.080
Is that your way of saying I'm late?

03:05.080 --> 03:07.720
You know, he's awfully candid
about your sex life.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.720
The rubber band sounds like a
good idea, but the bowling ball...

03:13.440 --> 03:15.800
Mon petit flaky croissant!

03:15.800 --> 03:18.520
Let's maintain a little
decorum at work, shall we?

03:18.520 --> 03:20.880
Gotta shake the tree
if you want the peaches.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.480
Victor!

03:23.480 --> 03:26.160
I like you...a lot.
               We are good together,

03:26.160 --> 03:28.200
but if there's any hope
             for us lasting,

03:28.200 --> 03:31.160
we have to come to a deeper
       understanding of one another.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.960
Take our relationship
to a higher plane.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.960
Out of the gutter would be nice.

03:45.720 --> 03:49.720
Hey, Dr Craig.
Start the day with a bear claw?

03:51.360 --> 03:55.360
Just leaving, sir.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.200
            Hi, Victor.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.840
Sorry!

04:00.840 --> 04:04.840
             My fault.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.560
Ah! Drink anything hot or cold,
eat something sweet,

04:09.560 --> 04:13.120
I get a shot of pain like I've been
hit with a Louisville slugger.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.040
Wayne, have the cavity filled.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.880
Why put it off?
Don't like your dentist?

04:17.880 --> 04:19.399
Nobody likes his dentist.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.040
Not me. Mark Dolson
and I were at Tulane.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.840
Then what's the big hoo-ha?

04:23.840 --> 04:26.680
Getting a hole drilled in my
head - not very appealing!

04:26.680 --> 04:27.720
It is to us.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.760
Dr Morrison...

04:28.760 --> 04:30.600
  Seth is covering for me today.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.240
No, no, no. This is a message from
your wife. What are you looking for?

04:34.240 --> 04:36.360
   String! I popped a shoelace.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.000
Anyway, Joanne said that she
can't find your marriage licence.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I have it. Joanne is legally
adopting Pete this afternoon.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.880
BUZZER

04:45.880 --> 04:49.880
Perhaps someone would
legally adopt Mr Durlacher.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.480
Boomer - big legal eagle day.
Adoption, parole board hearing...

04:54.680 --> 04:57.400
Why go back to Newcastle Prison?

04:57.400 --> 04:58.680
Moats belongs in jail.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.360
I wanna make sure he stays there.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.800
Ah, this'll do great!
Thanks, you guys.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.800
    Dr Kiem, I got the X-rays.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.760
I came as soon as I could.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.600
I got beeped in the
ladies' room with my scrubs down.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.280
I was on the phone with my husband

05:14.280 --> 05:16.320
when Mr Cantrell
was rushed up from ER.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.760
So what's the story?

05:17.760 --> 05:20.240
My son Jim stormed out of the house.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.840
He said he'd been
hitchhiking up from Maryland,

05:22.840 --> 05:24.680
demonstrating his independence.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.600
 I won't let him travel out west.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.320
Actually, I meant with the patient.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.640
Oh, of course.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.640
57-year-old male complaining of back
pain prior to losing consciousness.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.240
Did the ER get a CT scan?

05:38.240 --> 05:40.160
No. It was down.

05:40.160 --> 05:44.160
Ultrasound shows six-centimetre
aneurysm and surrounding haematoma.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.040
Must be leaking.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.000
Without the CT scan, the only
way we'll know for sure is to

05:50.000 --> 05:53.480
do an exploratory. Janice, would
you reschedule the next patient?

05:53.480 --> 05:57.440
This operation should delay my
schedule by about three hours.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.200
Number 11 blade.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.000
Two of my brothers
hitchhiked across country.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.760
They got shot at and chased
         into a Nebraska cornfield

06:05.760 --> 06:08.120
by some farmers because
             they had long hair.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.800
In your opinion, how long
should it take Jim to get up here?

06:11.800 --> 06:15.800
Hard to say. He can't thumb any
major throughways, it's illegal.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.320
He'll have to use some
really crummy back roads.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.480
I'd say two, maybe three days.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.520
   Jim left home four days ago.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.520
 We haven't heard from him since.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.800
Proud Mary, what ya got there?

06:31.800 --> 06:35.480
Oh, buttons, pins, shoelaces.

06:35.480 --> 06:39.480
Things people round here throw
away and then need later on.

06:39.480 --> 06:43.480
Now, Luther Hawkins, I got work.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.080
You've been dragging
your tail lately.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.040
I'm tired. I've been doing
a lengthy hop between orderly

06:49.040 --> 06:51.200
and physician's assistant
in training.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.280
15 hours here, 6 hours at school,
4 hours studying...

06:54.280 --> 06:55.160
That's 25.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.000
See how rough I got it?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.280
If your mother could
speak, she'd say...

07:00.280 --> 07:02.000
She'd say she's proud.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.600
She'd say, "Stop your fussing"!

07:04.600 --> 07:07.080
I never heard your mother complain.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.840
Worked with us since
before you were born.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.960
What a sight she was, carrying you!

07:12.960 --> 07:16.960
Pushing a mop, stomach out to there!

07:19.800 --> 07:22.200
Still feel your mom in these halls.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.280
Only thing I feel is the heat.

07:24.280 --> 07:28.280
For once. At least the patients
won't catch the death of cold.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.000
You know, a lot of people die here.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.960
Some go quiet,

07:32.960 --> 07:34.960
some fight.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.960
But most die uneasy,
cos they don't have what they want.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.480
You got what you want?

07:41.480 --> 07:43.600
I'm not sure.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.840
Heard they're selling
the hospital to Boston G.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.320
What would BG want with St E?

07:50.320 --> 07:54.320
You mean because we don't have
white walls and carpeting? Hm.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.600
New owners will go through
here like a dose of salt.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.280
Redecorate, bring in
a fancy cleaning crew.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.600
I'll lose my job, have to retire.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.600
I wouldn't worry yet.
It ain't over till it's over.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.160
There's a scrap developing
at the blue line.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.960
These guys have been taking shots
at each other all night.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.160
One of them's making a trip to the
penalty box. Down centre ice,

08:16.160 --> 08:19.280
the goal's wide open, he gets
a shot off. Oh, a dazzling save!

08:19.280 --> 08:21.280
Play comes out at the
end of the ice...

08:21.280 --> 08:22.920
Score! Ha!

08:22.920 --> 08:26.600
How does he do that? Rematch.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.120
No. I have to finish meds.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.120
You know, my uncle has a name
for a guy like you. Sports homo.

08:33.799 --> 08:37.120
Yeah, well, you didn't tell
me what I'd win if I beat you.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.600
Oh! Well...

08:38.600 --> 08:40.919
Victor!

08:40.919 --> 08:44.920
You gotta watch out for her,
she's got real strong wrists.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.320
Swamp and tickle's no good,
but slap shot's OK, huh?

08:48.320 --> 08:50.040
What?

08:50.040 --> 08:52.760
Hospital decorum.
You and Griffin pucking around.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.680
I smell smoke from a distant fire.

08:54.680 --> 08:57.240
Well, maybe you just smell!

08:57.240 --> 09:00.120
Oh, Mr Brody, do you need
help getting back to your room?

09:00.120 --> 09:02.280
Course not.
Right, Mr Brody, here you go.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.960
Oh, Victor, stop playing games!

09:03.960 --> 09:07.320
You're the one trying to send
Griffin to the penalty box, sister!

09:07.320 --> 09:08.400
Stop spitting on me!

09:08.400 --> 09:09.800
That's just my sibilant S.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.560
Well, try to tighten your tongue,

09:11.560 --> 09:13.760
so you don't blab about
our sex life to Rosenthal.

09:13.760 --> 09:17.120
Who needs to blab with you doing
Johnny Weissmuller at full swing!

09:17.120 --> 09:19.240
You say the most insensitive things.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.440
You know, I don't even know
why we're going out.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.600
I should just wake up.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.800
Yeah? Well, here, let me help you.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.840
There.

09:26.840 --> 09:30.840
Hello and goodbye, Victor.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.160
Lucky I got out of her
web without being eaten.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.880
Dentists always give you a shot of
Novocaine and then leave the room.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.200
     Where do they go, anyway?

09:45.200 --> 09:46.240
Trade secret.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.280
    You know, it's not very numb yet.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.160
Maybe Mark should give me a
booster before we blast off.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.640
Dr Dolson says you two
went to school together.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.320
    Till he decided to spend his life

09:55.320 --> 09:57.880
putting his fingers in
other peoples' mouths.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.400
Oh. Dr Dolson enjoys his work.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.920
He's always so happy and cheerful!

10:02.920 --> 10:06.000
He's quite a lovely whistler, too.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.760
Let's see how we're doing.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.960
Where do you buy your shirts
these days? Nairu, at any price?

10:10.960 --> 10:14.600
Whenever Wayne's nervous,
he makes stupid jokes.

10:14.600 --> 10:17.880
Actually,
he always makes stupid jokes.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.920
METAL HITS FLOOR

10:18.920 --> 10:22.920
Whoops! Hang on...

10:23.040 --> 10:25.120
   You're not building my confidence.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.640
Relax.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.840
Never seen Marathon Man?

10:28.840 --> 10:31.520
Never seen Marathon Man?
DRILL WHIRRS

10:31.520 --> 10:33.520
You know the drill, Wayne.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.160
                         Hands clean?

10:34.160 --> 10:35.200
                         Hands clean?
Open.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.160
You know, you should gargle
and clip those nose hairs.

10:39.160 --> 10:43.160
DRILL WHIRRS

10:45.120 --> 10:49.120
Dr Dolson!

10:51.800 --> 10:54.040
Appreciate you
testifying, Dr Morrison.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.560
Been 16 years since
Moats first checked in here.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.280
Law says, even if somebody's
in here for life, got to review.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.160
  Parole hearings come up every year.

11:02.160 --> 11:06.160
So, slick Nick gets to step up
to the plate one more time.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.640
What's his background?

11:07.640 --> 11:11.360
Not supposed to discuss his
rap sheet - bias your opinion.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.320
Not that I could. But on the QT,
armed robbery, manslaughter, murder.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.600
Shouldn't be in front
of the board too long.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.360
It's really always just
a formality. Any questions?

11:20.360 --> 11:24.360
Yeah, um, bathroom?

11:24.520 --> 11:25.560
 (VOMITS)

11:25.560 --> 11:26.600
             Nervous?

11:26.600 --> 11:28.000
What's the big deal?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.760
I skipped my cornflakes
this morning and flaked out.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.840
                           Feel that?

11:32.840 --> 11:33.880
                       How about now?

11:33.880 --> 11:34.920
Nada.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.960
Ow!

11:35.960 --> 11:39.960
Yeah. Prick.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.360
Let's take Dr Dolson
upstairs for an electromyogram.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.960
You drunk?

11:48.960 --> 11:50.840
   Novocaine. Grab a wheelchair.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.240
Next stop, neurophysiology.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.560
What's going on?

11:54.560 --> 11:56.840
Nothing to worry about.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.880
Sure.

11:57.880 --> 12:01.880
My best friend the doctor won't
even tell me what it is I've got.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.520
Mark, it could be a lot
of things, a herniated disc,

12:04.520 --> 12:05.960
      peripheral neuropathy.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.960
Level with me, Wayne.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.920
    We have to run more tests,

12:12.920 --> 12:16.920
but your symptoms sound
like multiple sclerosis.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.200
This ER was built in 1965?

12:35.200 --> 12:38.560
Same year you were appointed Chief
of Surgery at Boston General.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.840
            I left to come back here.

12:39.840 --> 12:43.840
The mayor's report calls this ER
a black hole, sucking out money

12:43.960 --> 12:45.760
faster than it can be poured in.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.080
It comes with the territory,
I'm afraid.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.840
Add to that the burden of
        caring for all the indigents

12:50.840 --> 12:52.240
you turn away across town.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.800
Josiah,
does Boston General have a plan

12:54.800 --> 12:56.800
for alleviating the financial drain?

12:56.800 --> 12:58.520
Of course, alleviate the drain.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.160
Close down patient care altogether.
We may turn St Eligius

13:01.160 --> 13:04.280
into our administrative lab
and billing facilities.

13:04.280 --> 13:08.280
Doctors and nurses have spent their
lives sustaining this hospital.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.440
Daniel, nothing's definite yet.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.520
St Eligius is a vital part of
this neighbourhood, Josiah,

13:13.520 --> 13:16.800
and even considering
shutting its doors stinks!

13:16.800 --> 13:20.800
Josiah.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.800
Obviously won't be
a friendly takeover.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.080
Well, what do you expect?

13:26.080 --> 13:28.600
Donald grew up in these hallways.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.760
He watched St Eligius being
built from the very first brick.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.760
And Daniel has been Chief of
Services since before I signed on.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.880
Some men lose their effectiveness.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.920
Listen, Mark.
I want to you know this spring

13:44.920 --> 13:48.560
I'm going to be named Director
of Medicine and Operations.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.560
Now, I can't offer a position
to Daniel or Donald,

13:53.160 --> 13:55.280
but be assured,

13:55.280 --> 13:59.280
Boston General wants you.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.720
As Chief of Surgery.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.960
Keep an eye on Mr Cantrell.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.760
I'd like to assist later
on in the surgery.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.360
I need more time learning
axillary dissection.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.360
Happy to have you.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.440
Paulette, have you
heard from your son?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.440
No. Just on my way
                to find five minutes

14:26.440 --> 14:28.680
of being at peace and...meditate.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.240
Marcie used to meditate until she
became one with the cocoa bean.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.480
How's she doing?

14:33.480 --> 14:35.120
She's checked into a fat farm.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.880
Cold turkey. No more chocolate.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.840
Not even a Hershey's Kiss.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.080
You try to raise your
kids as best you can,

14:42.080 --> 14:44.600
but can we really protect them?

14:44.600 --> 14:48.600
Marcie blames me
for her eating disorder.

14:48.960 --> 14:52.960
Well, maybe I should have let
Jim climb that stupid mountain.

14:54.840 --> 14:58.840
My next patient.
Being at peace will have to wait.

15:02.160 --> 15:06.160
Hear the rumour? Boston
General's about to gobble us up.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.200
Were you ever afraid of losing
Robert, get jealous?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.200
Oh, I'll come back later.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.160
No, it's OK.
Sorry this place is such a mess.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.080
That's what I'm here for.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.680
Relationships are supposed
to be built on trust.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.080
That's what I thought.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.960
Sure, sometimes I'd catch
Robert ogling a girl -

15:28.960 --> 15:31.760
figured that's what guys do.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.760
I saw Lucy with another guy. Made my
green-eyed monster stand up on end.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.040
But I said things I shouldn't have.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.720
I'll stand still.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.600
Anyway, now I've lost Lucy,
I don't know what to do.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.640
Open, honest communication.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.080
Sit her down, tell her how you feel.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.040
I'm inarticulate.
I always say the wrong thing.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.520
Besides, with my sibilant S, wouldn't
be able to say it, not spray it.

15:55.520 --> 15:59.520
In high school, Robert used to write
me these long, sugary love letters.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.720
They were beautiful.
Still have some of them.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.920
Huh.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.320
Try it with Lucy.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.080
Organise your thoughts,
     write them down,

16:08.080 --> 16:10.560
if something doesn't work,
    just cross them out.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.360
Maybe. Course, if you were so smart,

16:13.360 --> 16:17.360
your marriage never would have
self-destructed.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.680
Moats forced his way
       into the infirmary.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.320
I was busy treating
this other inmate...

16:27.320 --> 16:28.960
      No guards were present?

16:28.960 --> 16:31.480
You are aware this is
against Newcastle policy.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.840
A riot had broken out.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.960
We're not assessing culpability
 on your part Dr Morrison,

16:35.960 --> 16:37.400
just asking what happened.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.760
When I told Moats to leave, he...

16:40.760 --> 16:42.880
he refused.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.640
That's when he pulled a knife.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.840
No knife was found after lockdown.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.040
He had a knife!

16:51.040 --> 16:52.160
Ask the nurse.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.880
Sylvia Birkway's testimony
is right in front of me.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.720
You know how easily inmates
can ditch weapons, drugs.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.840
Continue, Dr Morrison.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.680
I warned Moats to leave.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.119
He and McAllister...

17:04.119 --> 17:06.760
This is not Stephen McAllister's
parole hearing.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.760
Would you stop interrupting me?
What the hell is your problem?

17:10.760 --> 17:14.240
Don't you understand? I was raped!
I was forced down to the ground,

17:14.240 --> 17:18.240
my arms behind my back,
my face against the tile.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.839
And worse than what Nick Moats
did to me physically is the way

17:21.839 --> 17:25.760
he invaded my life, and the
fact that we are all sitting here

17:25.760 --> 17:29.760
deciding whether or not
to let this guy go...

17:30.280 --> 17:34.280
If you ever get the chance to strap
Nick Moats in the electric chair,
call me.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.400
Because I'm gonna watch.

17:36.400 --> 17:40.400
I'm gonna pull the switch.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.120
That's all, Dr Morrison.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.000
Always thought you had great buns.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.680
 Treat me like any other patient.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.680
That way, there's half a chance
I'll come out of this alive.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.680
Yeah. Gonna feel a little bite here.

18:26.040 --> 18:30.040
Long way from freshman year when I
was the one prescribing the medicine.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.920
Don't remind me.

18:32.920 --> 18:36.920
    Remember Stewart Kassmeier?

18:38.040 --> 18:41.720
He came down with MS
just before graduation.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.200
I can still see him
in that wheelchair,

18:44.200 --> 18:48.200
too weak and twisted
to walk up and get his diploma.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.320
   I don't want to be crippled.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.520
        I'm scared, Wayne.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.920
Just a cardio.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.320
Next time, cancel the code.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.480
I misread the vitals.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.200
Nobody gets the story
straight when you're around.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.640
What are you yakking about?

19:12.640 --> 19:15.600
Victor! Saw us talking.
Thought it meant something.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.640
(LAUGHS)

19:16.640 --> 19:18.680
He thought we had a thing going on?

19:18.680 --> 19:20.640
I care about Victor.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.400
He cares about me.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.800
Or he did, anyway.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.640
Makes me feel good about myself,

19:25.640 --> 19:28.720
says my beauty translates
from the Greek.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.680
And now he...

19:29.680 --> 19:32.880
How could Victor
possibly think...

19:32.880 --> 19:35.400
You and me, huh?

19:35.400 --> 19:39.400
Listen, bucko,
I'd break your heart, and your jaw.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.280
     Check the surgical board.

19:50.280 --> 19:54.280
You're booked solid.
Thought I'd pitch in.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.920
Dr Paulette Kiem,
this is Dr Josiah Bartlett.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.920
What procedure are you performing?

20:00.920 --> 20:04.040
Bypass a femoral obstruction.

20:04.040 --> 20:07.560
Aoartobifemoral bypass,
to be more precise.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.400
Whatever you say, Mark!

20:09.400 --> 20:11.840
 Oh, a bit snippy today, Paulette.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.840
         Kiem, move over.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.120
 Impressive OR suite, eh, Josiah?

20:23.120 --> 20:26.200
We have one of the lowest
mortality rates in the state.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.360
More exposure.

20:27.360 --> 20:31.360
How much more
exposure do you need, Doctor?

20:31.440 --> 20:34.600
Well, moot point. Because it
will all probably go anyway.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.360
         What do you mean?

20:35.360 --> 20:38.920
         What do you mean?
Most likely these rooms will be
turned into storage for files.

20:38.920 --> 20:42.840
Well, as you said earlier,
nothing's definite.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.160
The suture is tearing the artery.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.040
For crying out loud,
we're not darning socks here!

20:48.040 --> 20:50.840
These ORs are a write-off.

20:50.840 --> 20:54.840
I spent 22 years making this
a top-notch surgical department.

20:55.280 --> 20:59.280
And soon you'll be
operating in  the  finest.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.600
Mark, help me here.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.760
Mark, help me here.
  Don't give me orders, Paulette!

21:02.760 --> 21:06.200
    I'm still Chief of Surgery.

21:06.200 --> 21:10.200
Dr Kochar, step in please.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.800
You want to run the show?
Finish Mrs Jones' bypass.

21:39.880 --> 21:43.880
Moats.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.880
I know you thought I wouldn't
testify, that I'd be scared.

21:52.160 --> 21:56.160
I'm not afraid of you any more.

22:13.280 --> 22:16.160
Call upstairs,
make sure OR knows we're coming.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.160
Hold the elevator!

22:21.720 --> 22:25.720
Locate Dr Westphall,
tell him I need a consult stat.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.040
Great news, DDS. No MS.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.080
                               No BS?

22:35.080 --> 22:38.360
Only PS. We don't know
what caused your symptoms.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.760
         Who cares? They're gone now!

22:40.760 --> 22:42.280
           Sign me out.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.480
Listen, Mark, stick around.
Let me run a few tests.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.720
         How's your tooth?

22:45.720 --> 22:48.480
I'm not down in the mouth,
let's peg whatever this is.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.320
              Wayne, I feel terrific.

22:50.320 --> 22:54.320
You've got no reason to keep
me here. Where do I sign?

22:55.480 --> 22:59.480
Here.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.280
Thanks for showing me around.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.400
Well, you breezed
through here so fast,

23:04.400 --> 23:07.720
this hospital didn't have a chance
to put its best foot forward.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.480
St Eligius has two left feet.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.080
I think that's holding
you back, Mark.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.760
You know, my father was
a very famous surgeon.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.760
He told me that if I worked hard,

23:17.760 --> 23:21.040
someday, I'd be in charge at
a place like Boston General.

23:21.040 --> 23:24.800
Think of the miracles you will be
performing with our state-of-the-art

23:24.800 --> 23:27.840
cardiac unit. In no time at all,

23:27.840 --> 23:31.840
you'll be the toast of BG.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.560
I hope you tell Dr Bartlett
to look for a hospital elsewhere.

23:35.560 --> 23:37.560
 I don't want to talk about this.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.760
I'm surprised by your attitude.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.200
It seems like you could care less
whether St Eligius is sold or not.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.400
And you were no help to Donald
and Daniel when they first tried

23:46.400 --> 23:48.200
derailing the Mayor's proposals.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.360
And now there's a need
              for a rallying cry,

23:50.360 --> 23:51.760
someone like you could...

23:51.760 --> 23:52.840
Oh boy, you British!

23:52.840 --> 23:55.960
Look, people in this hospital
are willing to put themselves

23:55.960 --> 23:57.520
on the line to save this place.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.880
Do you think we want to end up a
month from now out on the streets?

24:00.880 --> 24:04.880
Keep pushing, Helen, and it will
happen a lot sooner or for you.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.440
I don't think we will
see Mr Cantrell up here again.

24:18.440 --> 24:22.440
Nice job. I'll reschedule Keith
Freidell's surgery for tomorrow.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.400
No, operate now.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.480
What's the hurry?

24:25.480 --> 24:29.480
Because Mrs Freidell is downstairs
wondering if her son has cancer.

24:29.720 --> 24:33.720
The procedure will
                 take me 20 minutes.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.920
The lab report will be back
in 30, and to postpone this

24:37.920 --> 24:40.200
biopsy until tomorrow
would be cruel to Keith's mother.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.600
biopsy until tomorrow
would be cruel to Keith's mother.
             You're pushing yourself.

24:41.600 --> 24:45.040
Don't say that!

24:45.040 --> 24:47.880
I'm sorry.

24:47.880 --> 24:51.880
I've been yelling at everybody,
 making mistakes.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.000
I keep telling myself
      he's all right.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
He's fine. &gt;

25:05.320 --> 25:09.320
Jim taking off like that
was a foolish thing to do.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.200
(LAUGHS)

25:13.200 --> 25:17.200
You know what? He's just like me.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.720
Dr Ehrlich!

25:32.720 --> 25:33.840
                      Spoil the mood.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.400
What's going on?
Flunked origami class?

25:36.400 --> 25:37.840
                     You'll make fun.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.600
Try me.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.520
  I'm writing Lucy a little...sonnet.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.600
Oh. Anyway... Can you
help me with this?

25:43.600 --> 25:45.440
                  What, no bons mots?

25:45.440 --> 25:47.040
Bon...?

25:47.040 --> 25:48.920
Bon...?
    Clever sayings, witticisms?

25:48.920 --> 25:51.640
Reaching way down to the
essence of your very being.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.120
Putting your barest,
     rarest feelings on pulp.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.280
I think that's noble.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.480
              Really?

25:56.480 --> 25:58.200
Probably a waste of time, too.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.280
I mean, since people say you
wouldn't know an honest emotion

26:01.280 --> 26:02.480
if you were lit on fire.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.040
 Now, about that cyclo-oxygenase.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.440
                       Take a powder.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.320
That a bon mot?

26:07.320 --> 26:11.320
                                 Out!

26:12.080 --> 26:14.680
        He's right. Who am I kidding?

26:14.680 --> 26:17.120
       It's over between Lucy and me.

26:17.120 --> 26:21.120
       A mere husk of my former self.

26:21.480 --> 26:25.480
   If I ever was a former self.

26:58.560 --> 27:02.200
Katherine and I have
    been toying with the idea

27:02.200 --> 27:04.000
of getting a place in the Big Apple.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.400
 Sounds like a good idea, Daniel.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.080
You'll be closer to your
grandchildren, anyway.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.040
You know, the North has
always appealed to me.

27:12.040 --> 27:15.720
I know it will be good for Lizzie
and Tommy. Start a private practice.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.440
   Vermont is a beautiful state.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.800
Mark, did Josiah give you any idea

27:19.800 --> 27:21.920
when they're going
       to write the cheque?

27:21.920 --> 27:24.520
          No, not a clue.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.400
Hit me, Donald.  Hmm?

27:26.400 --> 27:28.440
The hose.  The what?

27:28.440 --> 27:30.360
         For Pete's sake.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.440
     Spray him with the water.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.360
What, sorry.

27:34.360 --> 27:38.360
There you go.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.160
Thanks(!)

27:40.160 --> 27:44.160
It's as frustrating as hell to think
that we are being stopped by money.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.680
       Physical limitations.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.080
Maybe BG buying this
place is all for the best.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.440
They know the business
      side of hospitals,

27:51.440 --> 27:53.720
but there's no heart, no soul.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.840
Money can't change that.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.280
It just infuriates
me to think that some...

27:58.280 --> 28:00.280
fella in a grey flannel suit is gonna

28:00.280 --> 28:02.440
to walk in here and tell us that he
can do our job better than we can.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.760
to walk in here and tell us that he
can do our job better than we can.
Who says he can do the
job better than we can?

28:05.760 --> 28:07.200
     Right, I'm with you, pal.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.800
Where are you two going?

28:08.800 --> 28:12.800
We're not giving up St Eligius,
not without a damn good fight.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.680
    Are you with us this time?

28:14.680 --> 28:18.680
It's over, we've lost.
Fait accompli.

28:21.440 --> 28:25.440
       You're all wet, Mark.

28:32.920 --> 28:36.600
Hey!

28:36.600 --> 28:37.640
          Hey, slow down!

28:37.640 --> 28:39.080
How about cleaning this up?

28:39.080 --> 28:42.160
Things don't feel so
different around here after all.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.840
Should they?

28:44.840 --> 28:46.360
I mean, my adopting Pete.

28:46.360 --> 28:50.360
This afternoon I wasn't sure
I was doing the right thing.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.520
Mom, Peter's jumping on my bed.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.640
Tell him to get out of my room.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.720
Tell him yourself.

28:57.720 --> 29:01.720
I just have these certain feelings
for Caitlin and Christopher.

29:02.680 --> 29:05.080
Are you saying you don't love Pete?

29:05.080 --> 29:08.120
No, of course I love Pete.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.040
It's just that...

29:10.040 --> 29:14.040
To call myself his mother when
actually Nina was...

29:14.320 --> 29:16.960
I mean, Nina is Pete's mother.

29:16.960 --> 29:20.960
After the parole hearing today,
Moats didn't even recognise me.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.320
For months I been
tormented by this guy's ghost.

29:24.320 --> 29:28.320
He paralysed me, just like
Nina's memory has done to you.

29:29.080 --> 29:33.080
It's time for us both to let go
     and get on with our lives.

29:36.800 --> 29:40.800
PHONE RINGS

29:46.360 --> 29:48.080
Yeah, hello.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.520
Uh-huh.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.320
How long has the IV been out?

29:53.320 --> 29:56.200
          Jack, don't go!

29:56.200 --> 29:58.840
Just tell them
you want to stay at home.

29:58.840 --> 29:59.280
Yep.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.800
Yep.
     You don't have to do it.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.080
I'll be right over.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.120
I gotta go.

30:03.120 --> 30:06.440
Hang on.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.800
Doing great, Wayne.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.400
Dr Fiscus, my
arthritis is starting to flare.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.000
Almost at bedrock.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.320
Yabba-dabba-doo time!

30:14.320 --> 30:18.320
Open again.

30:23.680 --> 30:27.680
He can't expect me
to catch him twice in one day.

30:31.160 --> 30:35.160
Oh, my! Doctor?

30:36.160 --> 30:40.160
Doctor! Oh, my God.

30:41.320 --> 30:45.320
Doctor, help her,
       she's not breathing.

31:01.240 --> 31:03.320
She's choked on something.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.520
I'm not able to push air in.

31:05.520 --> 31:09.240
I'll call the nurses' station.

31:09.240 --> 31:13.240
Code blue in the doctors' lounge.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.800
The doctor in the
lounge is unconscious.

31:21.160 --> 31:25.160
We can't wait. I'll do a trach. Do
you have a knife or anything sharp?

31:31.200 --> 31:33.360
       Have a cleanse or antiseptic?

31:33.360 --> 31:37.360
No. Er, alcohol
for disinfecting wounds.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.000
           I'm going to need a tube.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
                     An old IV hose.

31:59.080 --> 32:02.680
            Excellent.

32:02.680 --> 32:06.680
            Excellent.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.240
You did it!

32:21.240 --> 32:23.120
              Uh-huh!

32:23.120 --> 32:27.120
         Pretty good, huh?

32:35.040 --> 32:35.840
Long day?

32:35.840 --> 32:37.280
Long day?
             It's OK.

32:37.280 --> 32:41.200
OR was Paulette PM.
She's pretty intense. Family worries.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.120
That's the great thing
about being a WASP from Westport.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.440
No worries.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.280
Griffins not a tight-knit bunch?

32:48.280 --> 32:51.080
Kind of fell apart
after my mom died.

32:51.080 --> 32:53.520
We rarely even get together
        on the holidays.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.760
I've always been closer to
my husband's tribe than my own.

32:56.760 --> 33:00.760
I miss his family wingdings
even more than him.

33:02.560 --> 33:06.040
It's been a long day for me, too.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.160
Still camping out at the Craigs'.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.640
Tired of eating my meals
next to a one-year-old.

33:11.640 --> 33:14.760
Do you feel like grabbing
a bite at Chet's Last Call?

33:14.760 --> 33:18.760
         No, Seth, I don't think so.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.520
Take Keith back to his room
   and tell his mother

33:27.520 --> 33:31.520
that the result will be in shortly.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.480
Hi, Mom.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.760
Jim? Oh, Jim!

33:41.760 --> 33:42.960
Hey, what's the big deal?

33:42.960 --> 33:44.040
Where have you been?!

33:44.040 --> 33:46.800
I met up with
           some kids in Providence.

33:46.800 --> 33:50.800
(SOBS)

33:54.040 --> 33:57.640
Luther. In here late again?

33:57.640 --> 33:58.520
                           You, too.

33:58.520 --> 34:02.520
                           You, too.
Till I finish.
It's nice of Dr Auschlander
 to let you study in his office.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.520
         Mary, don't get this wrong.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.400
Do you ever get tired
of cleaning this place?

34:10.400 --> 34:12.760
Cleaning's just what I do
while I'm doing other things.

34:12.760 --> 34:13.719
                          Like what?

34:13.719 --> 34:16.719
                          Like what?
Oh, a little of this and that.

34:16.719 --> 34:19.360
You spend the days scrubbing
your way down the halls

34:19.360 --> 34:20.760
  only to have them messed up again.

34:20.760 --> 34:24.159
Is that how you think
about being an orderly?

34:24.159 --> 34:27.440
I try not to think about
being an orderly, period.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.199
Wiping up after patients,
wheeling them around.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.480
A lot of people don't
give us a second thought.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.440
But we are important. This hospital
couldn't get along without us.

34:35.440 --> 34:39.440
Maybe, but tough as it is
becoming a PA, I'd never turn back.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.960
I want to help people.
Make a difference.

34:42.960 --> 34:46.040
I felt the same way
when I was your age.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.280
I was going to be a lawyer.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.840
   You couldn't get into law school?

34:48.840 --> 34:51.719
Good grades came easily.

34:51.719 --> 34:55.600
As long as it was just me
and my books.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.160
I was a whip. Everybody told me so.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.720
My friends, my parents, my teachers.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.680
And the more they told me
    how smart I was,

35:03.680 --> 35:07.680
the more afraid I was
   that I wasn't smart at all.

35:07.920 --> 35:11.920
That somehow
 I'd been fooling them all along.

35:12.240 --> 35:16.240
I got so scared of being successful.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.280
I just dropped back into the crowd.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.880
Got a job here.

35:27.880 --> 35:31.880
Well, maybe it's time
you stepped back out.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.200
I'm happy where I am.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.200
As long as they don't sell
St Eligius.

35:44.640 --> 35:48.640
Pulse was racing,
pupils dilated, paresthesias.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.480
What drugs are you taking?

35:54.480 --> 35:55.560
                                 Me?

35:55.560 --> 35:58.080
You would try any chemical
that came through New Orleans,

35:58.080 --> 36:00.960
hit the bong every morning
before brushing.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.240
                       And flossing.

36:02.240 --> 36:06.240
        Paid off, too. Healthy gums.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.240
Nitrous!

36:09.240 --> 36:13.240
You're tapping
into the laughing gas.

36:13.360 --> 36:16.320
This stuff's there.
It's free, basically.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.960
Semi-legitimate. You crazy?

36:18.960 --> 36:22.880
Here we go. The same self-righteous
Fiscus from Tulane.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.840
Don't you know what long-term
exposure to nitrous will do?

36:25.840 --> 36:27.760
No, but short-term exposure is a gas.

36:27.760 --> 36:31.760
Even with only recreational use,
you're facing neurological
damage, permanent paralysis...

36:32.440 --> 36:36.440
   It makes the day bearable, Wayne.

36:39.760 --> 36:43.760
Ever since that afternoon the
Dean called me into his office

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
and accused me
of fraudulent research.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.240
I know all the theory was correct.
I just took a short cut.

36:53.240 --> 36:57.240
 Too much pressure. Too little time.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
       You're out, he said.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.760
       My brilliant career.

37:03.760 --> 37:07.760
               Over.

37:10.280 --> 37:14.280
      I hate being a dentist.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.360
Medicine's not all there is.

37:16.360 --> 37:20.360
You have to think about
the things that you haven't done
yet, like got married, had a kid.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.480
           Go to Nepal.

37:23.480 --> 37:27.480
Well, you never will unless
you stop strapping on the mask.

37:27.640 --> 37:31.200
And if you quit, your symptoms
will disappear in a week.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.440
         I'll try, Wayne.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.960
I'll help you, bud.

37:34.960 --> 37:38.960
We give each other hope,
confidence and 100% support.

37:42.480 --> 37:46.480
The truth is, I would have
been a better doctor than you.

37:47.520 --> 37:51.520
I know.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.040
Oh!

38:02.040 --> 38:04.440
Finally got Mr  Durlacher  cleaned up.

38:04.440 --> 38:05.960
Goody.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.960
         He asked for you.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.800
He said you remind him of his wife.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.520
She's dead.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.080
This is for you.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.600
It better be my OT pay.

38:15.600 --> 38:19.600
If this is your money,
it smells like creamy vinaigrette.

38:26.120 --> 38:29.680
"I know a woman lovely
     as the grove of olives,

38:29.680 --> 38:32.240
"bright eyed as the sapphire sea,

38:32.240 --> 38:36.240
"all honey-haired and breath like
fresh baked loaves of bread and wine

38:36.520 --> 38:40.520
"and feta cheese.
      Sheer nectar. Hector."

38:40.840 --> 38:42.880
Oh!

38:42.880 --> 38:46.880
Oh, Ehrlich. You sweetie!

38:50.440 --> 38:52.000
BUZZER

38:52.000 --> 38:53.080
Mr  Durlacher  again.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.480
Could you get that?

38:56.480 --> 39:00.480
Oh, and tell him
I'm already spoken for.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.880
There must be a way out
            of this conundrum.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.760
Sure, the front door.

39:07.760 --> 39:11.200
I think our best bet is
to stall. Maybe Boston General
  will lose interest.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.040
At least give us time to think of
some way to turn this place around.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.960
At least give us time to think of
some way to turn this place around.
                    Better be quick.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.240
Glad I caught you all.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.360
   I want to tell you something.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.000
     You know, you were right.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.440
I could work miracles at
Boston General. But so what?

39:23.440 --> 39:27.000
With that equipment and
calibre of patients, anyone could.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.560
        You know, in 1965,

39:28.560 --> 39:32.560
I left BG to come to St Eligius
because they needed doctors like me,

39:33.040 --> 39:36.560
who could turn a cleaning cart
into a crash cart and save a life.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.240
The people in this neighbourhood
are desperate.

39:39.240 --> 39:43.200
No-one else can do the job.
So you can take your state-of-the-art
surgical department

39:43.200 --> 39:46.000
and your art gallery walls
and shove 'em!

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Because if St Eligius goes down,
we'll go down together.

39:50.200 --> 39:53.760
My, I admire your convictions.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.120
But I'd just come
      from a board meeting,

39:56.120 --> 40:00.120
and in our minds,
buying this building
  would be a very large mistake.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.320
There won't be a sale after all.

40:03.320 --> 40:07.120
Oh, boy. You guys at Boston General,
you've got no guts.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.520
Excuse me.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.000
Still alive, my friend.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.880
                           Hot damn!

40:11.880 --> 40:13.760
Jack, testifying go all right?

40:13.760 --> 40:16.240
Yeah, I went.

40:16.240 --> 40:19.400
I went hoping
to get revenge somehow.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.120
I realise that's wrong.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.320
Wanting to hurt Moats
is just killing me.

40:23.320 --> 40:27.320
Everything's fine now.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.320
Do you have reason to smile?

40:36.320 --> 40:40.320
Absolutely. That expensive German
rolling-stock belongs to Bartlett.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.000
Good night, Martin.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
Good night.

40:53.760 --> 40:57.760
Good night, Dr Craig. Thank you.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.840
          Where the hell is my car?!

41:07.840 --> 41:09.200
Auf Wiedersehen!

41:09.200 --> 41:13.200
But if you hurry,
you might catch the bus.

41:34.960 --> 41:38.600
Victor!

41:38.600 --> 41:39.840
Don't hurt me.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.280
I'm never going to hurt you again.

41:42.280 --> 41:45.000
How did you find me?

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
You always come down here
          when the MRS is down.

41:49.120 --> 41:51.360
Lucy, I said some things earlier.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.480
Me, too.

41:52.480 --> 41:56.480
But now I know you are sensitive,
so let's clear the boards

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
and round 'em up.

42:12.680 --> 42:16.320
A better relationship,
the next level.

42:16.320 --> 42:20.320
Hang on!

42:25.360 --> 42:26.480
Feel the earth move already!

42:26.480 --> 42:29.080
Feel the earth move already!
Me, too!

42:29.080 --> 42:31.680
Victor, marry me!

42:31.680 --> 42:32.880
             I'm game!

42:32.880 --> 42:34.080
Ah!

42:34.080 --> 42:36.560
KNOCK AT DOOR

42:36.560 --> 42:39.560
Door!

42:39.560 --> 42:40.800
KNOCKING CONTINUES

42:40.800 --> 42:41.840
KNOCKING CONTINUES
Mom!

42:41.840 --> 42:42.560
&lt; What is it?

42:42.560 --> 42:43.920
&lt; What is it?
Someone's at the door.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.000
Caitlin, are your legs broken?

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
Jack probably forgot his keys.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.960
&lt; Hi there. Is Jack home?

42:52.960 --> 42:54.480
            Sorry, no.

42:54.480 --> 42:58.000
&lt; Doggone luck. I just got in
from outta town. Old friend.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.960
You can reach him at the hospital.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.800
&lt; No, I don't want to bother him.
I know how hard he works.

43:02.800 --> 43:06.680
&lt; Good doctor. Hiya, Buster!

43:06.680 --> 43:10.640
Cute kids, nice apartment.

43:10.640 --> 43:14.640
Hah, I'll be back some other time.

43:30.600 --> 43:54.000
