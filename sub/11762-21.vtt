WEBVTT

00:00.731 --> 00:02.673
HEY, YOU GUYS. GUESS WHAT.

00:02.673 --> 00:04.675
MY BOYFRIEND SMITH
FINISHED LAW SCHOOL.

00:04.675 --> 00:07.508
(singsongy)
HE COMES HOME TODAY.
WOW. THAT IS SO...

00:07.508 --> 00:10.181
JULES, WHAT'S THE WORD
FOR "WHO CARES?"

00:10.181 --> 00:13.184
ELLIE TORRES, I OPENED
MY BEST BOTTLE OF WINE FOR YOU

00:13.184 --> 00:16.187
LAST NIGHT, AND YOU LEFT A SIP.
I WOULD NEVER.

00:16.187 --> 00:17.718
THIS IS YOUR LIPSTICK.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.750
(singsongy) WINO FIGHT.
THAT WAS MY GLASS.

00:19.750 --> 00:22.493
I ACCIDENTALLY WORE
COLORED LIP BALM YESTERDAY.

00:22.493 --> 00:26.157
IT'S BARELY COLORED,
AND IT MAKES MY EYES POP.

00:26.157 --> 00:28.629
THAT'S HOW IT STARTED
FOR MY UNCLE MAX.

00:28.629 --> 00:32.163
THEN HE BOUGHT SOME WIGS
AND CHANGED HIS NAME TO MAXINE.

00:32.163 --> 00:35.206
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY
FUNNY? HE STILL GOES BY "MAX."

00:35.206 --> 00:38.069
"WHO CARES?" "WHO CARES?" WAS
THE WORD I WAS LOOKING FOR.

00:38.069 --> 00:40.040
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA DRINK IT.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.273
IT'S 8:00 A.M. ON A SATURDAY.

00:42.273 --> 00:45.276
SO? THIS IS JUST LIKE A MIMOSA,
EXCEPT FOR IT'S GOT WINE

00:45.276 --> 00:47.047
INSTEAD OF CHAMPAGNE
AND NO ORANGE JUICE.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.181
SOUNDS DELICIOUS.
MMM!

00:50.181 --> 00:53.053
WINE IN THE MORNING
ON THE WEEKENDS.
(door opens and closes)

00:53.053 --> 00:56.056
LET'S ALL THINK ABOUT IT,
PEOPLE.
THINK ABOUT WHAT?

00:56.056 --> 00:59.059
MORNING DRINKING.
FOR IT.
JULES, I GRABBED YOUR MAIL,

00:59.059 --> 01:01.332
AND TRAVIS GOT
HIS FIRST COLLEGE LETTER.

01:01.332 --> 01:03.664
IT'S FROM HIS SAFETY SCHOOL.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.666
BIG ENVELOPE.
(singsongy) HE GOT IN.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.399
TRAVIS, HELP! I'M HURT!

01:08.399 --> 01:11.142
OTHERWISE IT TAKES HIM FOREVER
TO COME DOWNSTAIRS.

01:11.142 --> 01:13.144
OKAY, I DON'T WANT
TO CALL FAVORITES,

01:13.144 --> 01:16.277
BUT HERE'S THE HUG ORDER--
ME, THEN BOBBY, THEN ME AGAIN

01:16.277 --> 01:19.650
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

01:19.650 --> 01:22.783
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE OKAY.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.486
WHOA.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.717
OKAY.

01:26.717 --> 01:28.259
HERE WE GO.

01:28.259 --> 01:33.093
EVERYBODY SAID THAT I SHOULD
GET THE FIRST HUG, RIGHT?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.726
THEY REJECTED ME.

01:35.726 --> 01:38.098
WELL,
I GUESS THESE SHOULD PROBABLY

01:38.098 --> 01:40.501
GO BACK
IN THEIR HOLSTERS.

01:46.137 --> 01:49.480
I FORGOT HOW SMOOTH
YOUR TEETH ARE.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.782
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME, TOO,
SON.

01:51.782 --> 01:54.785
FORGIVE ME
IF I DON'T EAT YOUR FACE.
I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST--I HAVE A RULE

01:54.785 --> 01:57.418
THAT EVERY KISS MUST LAST
AT LEAST THREE SECONDS.

01:57.418 --> 02:01.222
IT'S WHAT THE OBAMAS DO.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.195
ANYWAY, TO CELEBRATE, I THOUGHT
THAT WE MIGHT GOLF TOGETHER.

02:04.195 --> 02:06.557
I HAVE A NEW PRO.
I'M AMAZING NOW.

02:06.557 --> 02:09.800
DOUBT IT, BUT I'M IN.
WELL, THANK YOU. I KNOW
YOU PREFER TO SPEND YOUR TIME

02:09.800 --> 02:11.902
LETTING HER TRY
TO TRICK A BABY OUT OF YOU.

02:11.902 --> 02:14.205
DAD, PLEASE JUST--

02:14.205 --> 02:17.568
I'M ALLERGIC TO LATEX
AND BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.

02:17.568 --> 02:19.139
NOT HELPING, BABE.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.143
SERIOUSLY?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.715
FEET OFF THE FURNITURE

02:24.715 --> 02:27.178
AND PICK UP ALL THIS KETTLE CORN
THAT YOU SPILLED.

02:27.178 --> 02:30.881
(sucking)
WITH YOUR HANDS,
NOT YOUR MOUTH VACUUM.

02:30.881 --> 02:33.884
AND THE EASIEST THING--
DRINKS GO ON COASTERS.

02:33.884 --> 02:37.828
QUICK HYPOTHETICAL--WHAT IF I
WAS TO TELL YOU THAT I'M A MAN,

02:37.828 --> 02:40.931
AND I CAN PUT MY DRINK DOWN
WHEREVER THE HELL I WANT?

02:40.931 --> 02:44.265
STUPID HYPOTHETICAL.

02:44.265 --> 02:48.369
(car alarm chirps,
dog barks in distance)
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE
NO SAY IN YOUR OWN HOME?

02:48.369 --> 02:51.171
WE BOTH LIVE ALONE.
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.674
(chuckles) I CAN PUT ON
MY OLD JEANS FROM HIGH SCHOOL

02:53.674 --> 02:56.207
AND ROCK OUT TO ENYA
IF I WANT TO.

02:56.207 --> 02:57.608
THAT'S... REALLY SPECIFIC.

02:57.608 --> 02:59.810
WHEN MY WIFE WAS AROUND,
THE ONLY TIME

02:59.810 --> 03:03.183
I HAD THE PLACE TO MYSELF WAS
AFTER SHE WENT TO BED.

03:03.183 --> 03:07.458
AND I'D WANDER AROUND
IN MY UNDERWEAR AND COWBOY HAT.
I HAVE SEVERAL COWBOY HATS.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.720
WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD
TO ANSWER TO ANYBODY

03:09.720 --> 03:13.564
SINCE SHARON DIED OF CANCER.
YOU'RE SO LUCKY.

03:13.564 --> 03:16.196
I-I JUST MEANT...

03:16.196 --> 03:18.229
MNH-MNH.
THERE'S NO SAVING THAT.

03:18.229 --> 03:19.730
(clink)
I'M LOVING THIS.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.302
ME, TOO.
(laughs)

03:21.302 --> 03:24.305
MMM. WHAT?

03:24.305 --> 03:26.477
IT'S 8:00 IN THE MORNING.
WE'RE TRYIN' SOMETHIN'.

03:26.477 --> 03:29.640
IT'S EUROPEAN.
WE DON'T ANSWER TO YOU.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.943
HOW YOU HOLDING UP THERE,
HONEY?
IT DOESN'T FEEL GREAT TO GET
TURNED DOWN BY A SCHOOL

03:32.943 --> 03:36.216
WITH FOUR GRAMMATICAL ERRORS
IN THEIR REJECTION LETTER.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.989
YOU KNOW,
I GOT INTO THAT SCHOOL.
COOL. KILL ME.

03:38.989 --> 03:40.991
I-I KNOW IT WAS
YOUR SAFETY SCHOOL,

03:40.991 --> 03:43.994
BUT YOU APPLIED
TO PLENTY OF OTHER COLLEGES.
TWO.

03:43.994 --> 03:47.958
PERFECT NUMBER. TRUST ME,
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.

03:47.958 --> 03:51.702
WELL, I'M SPEAKING THE TRUTH.
YOU'RE A HOME RUN HITTER!

03:51.702 --> 03:53.934
HE'S NOT.
OUR SON'S NOT GOING TO COLLEGE.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.666
THIS IS A DISASTER.

03:55.666 --> 03:58.369
NO, IT IS NOT. ALL RIGHT,
I NEVER FINISHED COLLEGE,

03:58.369 --> 04:00.771
AND LOOK AT ME.
I ENDED UP JUST...

04:00.771 --> 04:03.013
MORE WINE?

04:03.013 --> 04:05.316
FILL HER UP.
YES.

04:05.316 --> 04:09.249
OH, NO. YOU SEE
THAT GUY OVER THERE?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.021
JULES!
DON'T LOOK RIGHT AT HIM.

04:11.021 --> 04:14.385
I SAID, DON'T LOOK!
WHEN I HEAR "DON'T LOOK,"
I CAN'T HELP BUT LOOK.

04:14.385 --> 04:16.487
IT'S MY MOST SPECIFIC REFLEX.

04:16.487 --> 04:19.890
SMITH, REMEMBER WHEN WE MET
AND YOU WENT OFF TO LAW SCHOOL,

04:19.890 --> 04:21.892
WE ROLLED AROUND
WITH OTHER PEOPLE

04:21.892 --> 04:23.894
AND OCCASIONALLY HAD
MEDIOCRE PHONE SEX?

04:23.894 --> 04:27.998
YEAH,
IT WAS LIKE A FAIRY TALE.
HE'S ONE
OF MY ROLL-AROUND GUYS.

04:27.998 --> 04:30.000
JULES, DON'T LOOK. (laughs)

04:30.000 --> 04:32.373
OKAY, STOP IT.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.975
I CAN'T. IT'S TOO FUN.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.978
SMITH, MOST GUYS THAT I'VE DATED
WOULD GO OVER THERE

04:37.978 --> 04:40.751
AND MAKE A HUGE SCENE
AND BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HIM

04:40.751 --> 04:43.984
WITH HIS WALLET CHAIN.
BUT DON'T FREAK OUT, OKAY?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.457
NO PROBLEM.

04:46.457 --> 04:48.859
MWAH.

04:48.859 --> 04:50.591
I'M DUMPING SMITH.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.292
AND THERE IT IS.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.994
(alarm beeps)

04:59.530 --> 05:01.672
(Enya) в™Є DEH DEH в™Є

05:03.734 --> 05:05.536
в™Є DEH DEH в™Є

05:07.938 --> 05:10.441
в™Є DEH DEH в™Є

05:13.013 --> 05:16.747

SAIL AWAY в™Є

05:16.747 --> 05:21.452
в™Є SAIL AWAY,
SAIL AWAY, SAIL AWAY в™Є

05:21.452 --> 05:25.656
в™Є SAIL AWAY, SAIL AWAY,
SAIL AWAY в™Є

05:25.656 --> 05:26.997
в™Є SAIL AWAY, SAIL AWAY в™Є

05:26.997 --> 05:29.600
THE MAILMAN'S HERE. T-BONE!

05:29.600 --> 05:33.003
I SAW HIM FROM UPSTAIRS. HE PUT
SOME ENVELOPES IN OUR BOX.

05:33.003 --> 05:34.605
MAYBE THEY'RE CATALOGS.

05:34.605 --> 05:37.468
WE DON'T KNOW! WE DON'T--
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
AAH!

05:37.468 --> 05:40.110
OH, I JUST WANT TO BE
PART OF IT.

05:40.110 --> 05:42.673
WELL, WISH ME LUCK.

05:42.673 --> 05:45.115
NO. WE DO THIS AS A FAMILY.

05:47.478 --> 05:48.919
EVERYBODY READY?

05:51.682 --> 05:53.123
HELL, YEAH, BABY!

05:53.123 --> 05:54.855
ACCEPTED TO BOTH!

05:54.855 --> 05:57.027
HA HA! TAKE THAT, LIFE!

05:57.027 --> 06:00.691
OH, I DIDN'T THINK
HE WOULD GET IN ANYWHERE.
WHAT? BUT YOU SAID--

06:00.691 --> 06:04.364
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE LIKE BOBBY!
AAH!
I'M NOT GONNA BE LIKE YOU!

06:04.364 --> 06:06.937
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE LIKE ME!
WHOO-HOO!

06:06.937 --> 06:09.940
YOU, BUDDY, YOU ARE GONNA
TAKE THE WORLD BY STORM.
OH!

06:09.940 --> 06:11.972
FAMILY CONFIDENCE DANCE!

06:11.972 --> 06:15.045
LOOK IN THE MIRROR!
в™Є LOOK AT YOURSELF,
YOU SO SMART в™Є

06:15.045 --> 06:17.708
в™Є WHO, ME? в™Є
в™Є NOT YOU в™Є

06:17.708 --> 06:20.050
WHOO!
в™Є YOU SO SMART в™Є

06:20.050 --> 06:23.614
WOW. SO IT'S EITHER COLLEGE
20 MINUTES AWAY IN SARASOTA

06:23.614 --> 06:27.157
OR 20 HOURS AWAY
IN CALIFORNIA.

06:27.157 --> 06:30.020
WHICH ONE
DO YOU WANT HIM TO GO TO?

06:30.020 --> 06:32.593
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
WHAT I WANT. IT'S HIS CHOICE.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.595
THE WEATHER IS SO GOOD
IN CALIFORNIA.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.868
YEAH, IT ALSO HAS EARTHQUAKES
AND, UH, RACE RIOTS,

06:37.868 --> 06:40.901
SO, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY JUST CALM DOWN.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.033
AND THERE IT IS.

06:43.033 --> 06:47.938
в™Єв™Є

06:54.044 --> 06:56.046
(Jules) TRAVIS, HELP!
I'M HURT!

06:56.046 --> 06:58.549
YEAH, YEAH. I'M NOT FALLING
FOR THAT AGAIN.

06:58.549 --> 07:00.120
I'M SERIOUS THIS TIME.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.454
I'VE TWISTED MY ANKLE.
IT MIGHT BE BROKEN.

07:03.454 --> 07:04.695
OH, NO. WHAT?

07:04.695 --> 07:05.996
(both, singsongy) SUCKER!

07:05.996 --> 07:07.798
GREAT JOB, ADULTS.

07:07.798 --> 07:09.800
I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.132
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DECIDE
BETWEEN THESE TWO COLLEGES?

07:12.132 --> 07:13.934
I MEAN, ONE IS KNOWN

07:13.934 --> 07:16.166
AS "THE JEWEL
OF CENTRAL SOUTHWEST FLORIDA"

07:16.166 --> 07:19.670
AND THE OTHER ONE'S IN A STATE
WHERE PEOPLE LEAN OUT

07:19.670 --> 07:23.614
OF THEIR CAR WINDOWS
AND SHOOT YOU IN THE FACE.
SUBTLE. YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN PULL THIS OFF?

07:23.614 --> 07:26.146
MAYBE. I'M, LIKE,
THE THIRD SMARTEST PERSON HERE.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.479
WHAT NUMBER AM I?
SIXTH.

07:28.479 --> 07:32.823
THIS IS MY DECISION, SO I'M JUST
GONNA MAKE IT MYSELF, OKAY?
OHH.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.089
LET'S NOT GET WEIRD.

07:39.089 --> 07:41.031
IF I COULD,

07:41.031 --> 07:43.534
I'D HAVE THEM
SHRINK ME DOWN SO SMALL...

07:43.534 --> 07:45.936
(whispers) THAT I COULD
LIVE IN YOUR BLOOD.

07:45.936 --> 07:47.668
OKAY, GOOD.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.571
SHE'S GONNA LET HIM MAKE
HIS OWN DECISION, RIGHT?
NOW YOU'RE EIGHTH.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.673
WHAT? WHO'S SEVENTH?

07:55.075 --> 07:56.677
HOLA.

07:58.148 --> 08:01.952
в™Є SAIL AWAY,
SAIL AWAY, SAIL AWAY в™Є

08:01.952 --> 08:07.117
в™Є SAIL AWAY, SAIL AWAY,
SAIL AWAY в™Є

08:07.117 --> 08:09.720
в™Є SAIL AWAY,
SAIL AWAY, SAIL AWAY в™Є

08:09.720 --> 08:12.092
(music stops)

08:12.092 --> 08:13.794
(both blow raspberry)

08:13.794 --> 08:16.797
YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT
A CHANCE!

08:16.797 --> 08:19.700
YOU REALLY DID NOT.
COWARDS.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.102
ALL RIGHT.
GOTTA MEET MY DAD FOR GOLF.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.835
MM.
HEY. WHAT ABOUT
OUR 3-SECOND RULE?

08:24.835 --> 08:29.079
OH, YEAH.
ONE, TWO, THREE. SEE YA.

08:29.079 --> 08:30.541
BYE.

08:30.541 --> 08:34.745
(gags) HOW DID SPIT
BECOME SO UNSEXY?

08:34.745 --> 08:38.118
NO, HE DIDN'T. YOU JUST LOVE
DRAMA, AND FOR ONCE, THANK GOD,

08:38.118 --> 08:40.120
YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T NEED IT.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.553
BUT DRAMA IS SUCH A TURN-ON.

08:42.553 --> 08:45.225
THAT MAKES MY LADY PARTS BEEP.

08:45.225 --> 08:48.058
WOULD YOU RATHER BE WITH
SOMEONE EMOTIONALLY STABLE

08:48.058 --> 08:50.200
OR SOMEONE WHO, AT GAME NIGHT,

08:50.200 --> 08:52.202
CARVES "DIE, BITCH"
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE

08:52.202 --> 08:54.534
BECAUSE YOU THINK
HE SUCKS AT JENGA?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.568
THERE ARE POSITIVES
AND NEGATIVES TO BOTH.
THERE REALLY AREN'T.

08:57.568 --> 09:01.171
I KNOW. AND, HONEY,
I AM SORRY ABOUT YOUR TABLE.

09:01.171 --> 09:02.312
THAT'S OKAY.

09:02.312 --> 09:05.275
I ADDED A "T,"
SO NOW IT SAYS, "DIET, BITCH."

09:05.275 --> 09:07.818
IT'S ACTUALLY--
IT'S REALLY HELPFUL.

09:07.818 --> 09:10.721
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN KICK
MY DRAMA ADDICTION,

09:10.721 --> 09:12.022
BUT I'M GONNA TRY.

09:12.022 --> 09:14.254
THAT'S GREAT.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.157
OH. DO YOU THINK SMITH KNOWS
SOMETHING'S HINKY?

09:17.157 --> 09:19.890
THINGS WITH LAURIE
ARE REALLY...

09:19.890 --> 09:21.962
WHAT'S THE WORD? HINKY.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.334
PIPE DOWN, GIRLS.
WATCH THIS DRIVE.

09:24.334 --> 09:27.337
BOBBY'S BEEN TEACHING ME
FIVE DAYS A WEEK.

09:27.337 --> 09:29.039
(whack)

09:31.041 --> 09:33.103
YOU'RE FIRED.

09:33.103 --> 09:35.776
MULLIGAN TIME.
TRAVIS, GO GET IT.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.879
I TRAINED HIM
TO RETRIEVE GOLF BALLS

09:38.879 --> 09:41.311
BY PAINTING MEATBALLS WHITE.
(Travis barks)

09:41.311 --> 09:43.113
(panting)

09:43.113 --> 09:46.186
LAURIE'S NOT TOUGH TO FIGURE
OUT. SHE DIGS ON THE DRAMA.

09:46.186 --> 09:50.020
(whimpers)

09:50.020 --> 09:53.193
THAT'S THE GREATEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.195
SERIOUSLY, THINK ABOUT
THE HOTTEST NIGHT

09:55.195 --> 09:56.727
YOU AND LAURIE EVER HAD.
HOW'D IT START?

09:56.727 --> 09:58.729
PUT THE DAMN MONEY
IN THE BAG!

09:58.729 --> 10:01.972
HE'S GOT A GUN.
YEAH, HE DOES.

10:01.972 --> 10:03.974
THAT WAS A WEIRD THIRD DATE.

10:07.177 --> 10:08.208
(shrieks)

10:08.208 --> 10:10.841
TRAV, GO GET IT.
(growls)

10:10.841 --> 10:12.743
COULD BE A MEATBALL,
BROTHER.

10:14.344 --> 10:16.216
GOD, I HATE LYING TO HIM.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.149
OH. HI, KYLIE.

10:19.149 --> 10:21.892
I KNOW. IF TRAV GOES
TO CALIFORNIA WE'LL BREAK UP,

10:21.892 --> 10:24.024
BUT IF HE STAYS HERE,
WE'LL GET MARRIED

10:24.024 --> 10:27.658
AND HAVE BEAUTIFUL BABIES.
HE TOLD ME YOU'D SAY THAT.

10:27.658 --> 10:30.100
PLEASE. YOU KIDS
ARE GONNA MAKE IT.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.631
(chuckles)

10:31.631 --> 10:34.004
THEY ARE SO DONE-ZO.
YOU DO REALIZE

10:34.004 --> 10:36.636
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE TRAVIS GOES TO COLLEGE?

10:36.636 --> 10:39.109
I KNOW.
EXCEPT IT TOTALLY DOES.

10:39.109 --> 10:43.173
OKAY, I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SETTING
YOURSELF UP TO GET HURT.

10:43.173 --> 10:46.176
EVEN IF HE GOES JUST 20 MINUTES
AWAY, HE'S STILL LEAVING.

10:46.176 --> 10:50.180
COME ON. IF HE'S THAT CLOSE,
IT'S NOT GONNA STING.
CAN I GET SOME KETCHUP?

10:50.180 --> 10:54.054
YOU NEVER GAVE IT A CHANCE!
SAIL AWAY? (laughs)

10:54.054 --> 10:57.027
(whack)

10:57.027 --> 10:58.759
AH, RAT FARTS.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.832
HEY, DID YOU GO YET, DAD?
NO!

11:01.832 --> 11:05.165
DON'T LOOK AT ME THAT WAY.
JUST GO GET THE DAMN MEATBALL.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.367
HEY, IT'S WALLET CHAIN.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.370
HE'S THE GUY THAT LAURIE
ROLLED AROUND WITH.
YOU THINK "ROLLED AROUND"

11:10.370 --> 11:14.775
MEANS THEY JUST MADE OUT
OR THEY WENT ALL THE WAY?
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT MORE.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.247
NAH, I THINK THEY JUST KISSED
WITH A LITTLE UPSTAIRS WORK.

11:17.247 --> 11:19.379
BUDDY, WHAT WOULD LAURIE
WANT YOU TO DO?

11:19.379 --> 11:20.981
OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU OKAY?

11:20.981 --> 11:23.153
YEAH.
SORRY ABOUT THE BLOOD.

11:23.153 --> 11:25.756
I'M NOT.
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP.

11:25.756 --> 11:27.718
(gasps) MM!
MM!

11:31.762 --> 11:33.764
ARE YOU WATCHING ME SLEEP?

11:33.764 --> 11:35.365
YOU DON'T USUALLY WAKE UP.

11:35.365 --> 11:37.167
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE?

11:46.006 --> 11:47.177
(snores)

11:47.177 --> 11:50.110
(whispering)
LEAH, JOEL, ALEXIS.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.112
BUT THAT'S ONLY SEVEN.
COME ON.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.115
WE'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO FIGURE
OUT ALL EIGHT GOSSELIN KIDS.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.486
(whispering) JON.

11:56.486 --> 11:58.488
(whispers) NO.
HE'S THE CREEPY, DISGUSTING,

11:58.488 --> 12:01.451
WANTS-TO-BE-FAMOUS FATHER.
OH, RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT. OH.

12:01.451 --> 12:04.124
(gasps) COLLIN!

12:04.124 --> 12:06.396
YES, COLLIN.

12:06.396 --> 12:09.830
OKAY, NO MORE GAMES.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.062
WHEN I GOT DIVORCED,
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT--

12:12.062 --> 12:15.105
THAT MADE ME FEEL LIKE
I WASN'T ALONE, SO I GUESS--

12:15.105 --> 12:18.809
I GUESS I'M JUST HAVING A REALLY
HARD TIME LETTING YOU GO.

12:18.809 --> 12:21.041
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

12:21.041 --> 12:24.144
IF IT REALLY IS A TOSS-UP
BETWEEN THE TWO SCHOOLS,

12:24.144 --> 12:26.116
I WOULD LOVE IT
IF YOU WOULD STAY HERE.

12:26.116 --> 12:29.219
(door creaks)

12:29.219 --> 12:31.852
SLEEPY SHOW'S CANCELED TONIGHT.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.123
(whispers) DAMN IT!

12:35.055 --> 12:37.888
I WOULDN'T WATER MY PLANTS
WITH THIS ROSГ©.

12:37.888 --> 12:39.890
I MEAN, PARTLY
BECAUSE WINE KILLS PLANTS,

12:39.890 --> 12:43.033
BUT YOU KNOW,
YOU FEEL ME, RIGHT?
I KNOW I ASKED YOU OVER
LAST NIGHT,

12:43.033 --> 12:46.366
BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GONNA
BE AN EVERY-NIGHT THING.
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.398
I MADE STEAK.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.273
(thumping)

12:53.273 --> 12:55.345
OH, YEAH.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.277
(Bobby) MMM!

13:00.110 --> 13:01.852
(guitar chord whines)

13:03.353 --> 13:04.414
EVERYBODY OUT.

13:04.414 --> 13:05.986
(silverware clatters)

13:08.889 --> 13:11.892
AND, YOU, TOO.
COME ON!

13:11.892 --> 13:14.794
(pants) THAT WAS AMAZING.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.797
YEAH. AT ONE POINT, I THINK
YOU GAVE ME A SUPERMAN RIDE.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.099
(laughs)

13:19.099 --> 13:22.232
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT
OLD BOYFRIENDS FOR ME.

13:22.232 --> 13:25.475
I'M TRYING TO KICK
MY INSANE DRAMA HABIT.

13:25.475 --> 13:27.978
OH.

13:27.978 --> 13:29.379
WHAT "OH"?

13:29.379 --> 13:31.381
WHAT WOULD LAURIE
WANT YOU TO DO?

13:31.381 --> 13:33.313
YEAH, THAT'S NOT ME.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.445
HEY, WHOSE BALL IS THAT?

13:35.445 --> 13:38.218
(Travis growls)

13:38.218 --> 13:39.219
(panting)

13:39.219 --> 13:40.991
AAH!
(barks)

13:40.991 --> 13:43.153
YOU FED MY ADDICTION
WITH A LIE.

13:43.153 --> 13:46.156
I AM SO ANGRY AT YOU
RIGHT NOW!

13:46.156 --> 13:49.199
BEEP-BEEP ANGRY?
NO, SMITH! GOD.

13:54.204 --> 13:56.306
HOW DO YOU LIKE WHEN SOMEONE
WATCHES YOU SLEEP?

13:56.306 --> 14:00.210
(switch clicks)
ACTUALLY, I'VE KNOWN YOU'VE BEEN
THERE FOR ABOUT 40 MINUTES.

14:00.210 --> 14:02.512
AT ONE POINT,
YOU FELL ASLEEP,

14:02.512 --> 14:05.515
AND I WAS WATCHING YOU SLEEP
WHILE I PRETENDED TO SLEEP.
RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU THINK

14:05.515 --> 14:08.518
IT'S GOOD MOTHERING TO TELL
YOUR SON HE'S THE ONLY THING

14:08.518 --> 14:11.221
KEEPING YOU
FROM FEELING TOTALLY ALONE.

14:11.221 --> 14:13.123
OH, WAIT.
THIS FEELS LIKE A TRAP.

14:13.123 --> 14:16.426
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.
I MEAN, AFTER WHAT YOU SAID,

14:16.426 --> 14:19.159
YOU REALLY THINK
I EVEN HAVE A CHOICE ANYMORE?

14:19.159 --> 14:22.232
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING

14:22.232 --> 14:25.195
AFTER YOU SAID
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE ME.
YOU WIN, MOM.
I HOPE YOU FEEL GOOD.

14:25.195 --> 14:27.397
WELL, I DON'T NOW.

14:38.248 --> 14:41.011
HEY, FRICK.
FRACK'S ALREADY TRYING

14:41.011 --> 14:43.253
TO GET THE RING
OUT OF THE COFFEE TABLE.

14:43.253 --> 14:46.256
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN HIM?
IN A SEC. I'M A TAD DEWY.

14:46.256 --> 14:48.558
WELL, I TOLD YOU YOU COULD
STAY IN MY GUEST ROOM.

14:48.558 --> 14:50.590
I WAS MAKING A POINT.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.663
I HAVE A SNAIL ON MY ARM.

14:53.663 --> 14:56.196
SO COME ON, ELLIE.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.929
DO YOU THINK THAT I WAS
TRYING TO MANIPULATE TRAVIS?

14:58.929 --> 15:01.001
DO YOU CARE
WHERE TRAV ENDS UP?

15:01.001 --> 15:04.274
HELL, YEAH. I CAN'T AFFORD
TO VISIT HIM IN CALIFORNIA.

15:04.274 --> 15:07.307
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP HIM
FROM DOING WHAT HE WANTS.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.608
OUTPARENTED BY BOBBY.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.210
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.581
(strained voice) DAGGER!

15:11.581 --> 15:13.313
(groans)

15:13.313 --> 15:16.346
SO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

15:16.346 --> 15:17.547
UGH.

15:17.547 --> 15:19.249
WHICH PART?

15:19.249 --> 15:21.591
OUR FIGHT OR THE FACT
THAT IT GOT ME SO REVVED UP

15:21.591 --> 15:23.954
I WANTED TO BREAK
INTO YOUR APARTMENT,

15:23.954 --> 15:27.257
TIE YOU UP WITH MY UNDERWEAR
AND ROLL AROUND ALL NIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT
"ROLL AROUND" MEANS?

15:27.257 --> 15:30.100
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.
IT'S PATHETIC.

15:30.100 --> 15:33.203
HEY. HEY. SO YOU LIKE DRAMA.
WHO CARES?

15:33.203 --> 15:35.465
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE HAS
THEIR SEXUAL STUFF.

15:35.465 --> 15:37.937
I MEAN, SOMETIMES
I LIKE TO, YOU KNOW,

15:37.937 --> 15:40.940
PRANCE AROUND ON ALL FOURS
LIKE A LITTLE SHOW PONY.
(laughs)

15:40.940 --> 15:43.313
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME WEIRD.
YEAH, IT DOES.

15:43.313 --> 15:45.475
WELL, WHAT'S--
WHAT'S THIS, PRIVATE?

15:45.475 --> 15:48.178
в™Єв™Є

15:48.178 --> 15:50.180
YEAH, DRAMA CAN BE FUN
FOR A WHILE,

15:50.180 --> 15:52.022
BUT WITH MY OTHER BOYFRIENDS,

15:52.022 --> 15:54.624
ALL THE BIG SCENES
AND THE FIGHTING...

15:54.624 --> 15:57.287
EVENTUALLY, IT TURNED REAL,

15:57.287 --> 15:58.588
AND IT ENDED THINGS.

15:58.588 --> 16:01.691
AND I JUST DON'T WANT THAT
FOR US. DO YOU?

16:01.691 --> 16:03.393
NO.

16:03.393 --> 16:05.265
(Grayson) ME NEITHER.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.536
WHAT? THERE'S...

16:06.536 --> 16:09.199
THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME TO DO.
I...

16:09.199 --> 16:11.341
OHH.

16:11.341 --> 16:14.244
ARE YOU WATCHING ME SLEEP
AGAIN?

16:14.244 --> 16:17.677
WHEN I SQUINT, YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE YOUR SONOGRAM PICTURE.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.179
MEMORIES.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.311
SO YOU WANT TO GET
RIGHT INTO THIS APOLOGY

16:21.311 --> 16:24.554
OR YOU WANT TO BEAT AROUND
THE BUSH FOR A MINUTE?
BUSH.

16:24.554 --> 16:27.587
OKAY.
I LIKE YOUR... NECKLACE.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.290
I BORROWED THIS FROM ELLIE,
LIKE, SEVEN YEARS AGO,

16:30.290 --> 16:32.592
AND I NEVER GAVE IT BACK.
YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS IS,

16:32.592 --> 16:35.725
I LOVE IT, AND I CAN
NEVER WEAR IT AROUND HER.
MOM!

16:35.725 --> 16:37.727
ALL RIGHT, I'M AN IDIOT.

16:37.727 --> 16:40.470
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE
GO WHEREVER YOU WANT.

16:40.470 --> 16:43.473
YOU KNOW, I DECIDED TO GO
TO FLORIDA THE SECOND I GOT IN.

16:43.473 --> 16:46.706
I WAS JUST ANNOYED AT YOU.
WOW. OKAY, SO YOU JUST, UH,

16:46.706 --> 16:50.340
WANT TO GO HOP IN THE CAR
AND GO CHECK OUT THE CAMPUS?

16:50.340 --> 16:53.413
AW, HELL, YEAH, I DO. DO YOU
WANNA FREAK OUT FOR A SECOND?
MM-HMM.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.216
GO NUTS.
20 MINUTES AWAY!

16:56.216 --> 16:58.588
YOU'RE ONLY GONNA BE
20 MINUTES AWAY. MWAH.

16:58.588 --> 17:01.721
CAN'T EVEN TELL IT WAS THERE,
CAN YOU?

17:01.721 --> 17:04.154
NO. BUT I'LL ALWAYS KNOW.

17:04.154 --> 17:06.756
I DIDN'T WANT EVERYONE
OVER HERE.

17:06.756 --> 17:09.759
I WOKE YOU UP ON PURPOSE.
YOU KNOW THOSE THUMPS YOU HEARD?

17:09.759 --> 17:11.261
WHEN THEY WEREN'T LOOKING,

17:11.261 --> 17:14.334
I BANGED THE BROOM
ON THE CEILING, RIGHT... THERE.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.106
I-I DIDN'T DO THAT.

17:16.106 --> 17:18.268
LOOK, I LIKE HAVING A WIFE
WHO RULES THE HOUSE.

17:18.268 --> 17:20.470
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE YOU.

17:20.470 --> 17:23.643
(laughs)
BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
YOU POLICE ME TOO MUCH.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.815
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?
YOU CHOSE ME?

17:25.815 --> 17:27.817
(laughs)
THAT IS PRETTY SILLY.

17:27.817 --> 17:30.350
ANYWAY, SOMETIMES
I LIKE HAVING THE HOUSE

17:30.350 --> 17:31.781
TO MYSELF AT NIGHT.

17:31.781 --> 17:35.155
IT'S THE ONLY TIME
I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL MINE.
20 MINUTES AWAY.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.288
(breathlessly) HE'S ONLY
GONNA BE 20 MINUTES AWAY.

17:38.288 --> 17:40.490
YAY! IS THAT MY NECKLACE?

17:40.490 --> 17:43.463
OH, GOD. DON'T BE CRAZY.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.296
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY I'M HERE.

17:46.296 --> 17:49.299
I FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO GET YOU YOUR DRAMA FIX

17:49.299 --> 17:52.302
WHENEVER YOU NEED IT
WITHOUT IT EVER MESSING US UP.

17:52.302 --> 17:55.745
(sighs) AW, MAN.
WHY IS SHE HERE?
DAD, PLEASE TRY TO BE CIVIL.

17:55.745 --> 17:59.149
OKAY.
OH, THANKS, MR. FRANK.

17:59.149 --> 18:01.751
YOU HAVE A DUMB VOICE.
DAD, I'M WARNING YOU.

18:01.751 --> 18:04.484
YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME?
WHAT HAPPENED LAST CHRISTMAS?

18:04.484 --> 18:07.257
THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
I WAS DRUNK!
SMITH!

18:07.257 --> 18:10.290
WELL, I'M JUST GONNA GO DRIVE
OFF THE BRIDGE ON THE 16th.

18:15.825 --> 18:18.298
OH. IT'S 4:20.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.271
HOW GREAT IS THIS?
22 MINUTES DOOR-TO-DOOR,

18:21.271 --> 18:24.274
AND THAT GIRL JUST ASKED ME
WHAT TIME IT WAS.

18:24.274 --> 18:26.606
(sighs) SHE PROBABLY THINKS
I'M A STUDENT HERE.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.779
PROBABLY. OR SHE NOTICED
YOU HAVE A WATCH.

18:29.779 --> 18:31.741
MM. WELL, WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

18:31.741 --> 18:34.144
HEY, UH, REMEMBER NICK BARTEL?
HE'S A FRESHMAN.

18:34.144 --> 18:36.146
I TEXTED HIM
THAT I WAS HERE.

18:36.146 --> 18:39.149
HE SAID I COULD CRASH AT HIS
PLACE TONIGHT. IS THAT COOL?
OH, TONIGHT?

18:39.149 --> 18:40.590
YEAH.
SURE.

18:40.590 --> 18:43.193
OHH! THIS PLACE ROCKS.

18:43.193 --> 18:46.426
I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED,
AND I NEVER WANT TO GO HOME.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.298
(chuckles)
THAT'S GREAT.

18:48.298 --> 18:51.401
OH, SEE YA.
OKAY.

18:51.401 --> 18:54.704
HEY, YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY
DRIVING HOME ALONE, RIGHT?

18:54.704 --> 18:56.306
(sniffles)

18:56.306 --> 18:59.869
(Needtobreathe) в™Є IN YOUR OCEAN,
I'M ANKLE DEEP в™Є

18:59.869 --> 19:04.414
в™Є I FEEL THE WAVES
CRASHING ON MY FEET в™Є

19:04.414 --> 19:08.147
в™Є IT'S LIKE I KNOW
WHERE I NEED TO BE в™Є

19:08.147 --> 19:11.481
в™Є BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT в™Є

19:11.481 --> 19:13.423
в™Є I CAN'T FIGURE OUT в™Є

19:13.423 --> 19:14.484
(kisses)

19:14.484 --> 19:18.328
HAVE A NICE NIGHT, SWEETIE.

19:18.328 --> 19:22.462
в™Є WHEN YOUR TIDE RUSHES
OVER ME в™Є

19:22.462 --> 19:25.335
в™Є THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIGURE OUT в™Є

19:25.335 --> 19:27.497
EVEN IF HE'S
ONLY 20 MINUTES AWAY,

19:27.497 --> 19:29.339
HE'S STILL LEAVING.

19:29.339 --> 19:30.800
I KNOW.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.543
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

19:33.543 --> 19:36.946
I SHOULD HAVE.
в™Є THIS IS MY DESIRE в™Є

19:36.946 --> 19:39.349
COME ON.
LET'S GET YOU INSIDE.

19:39.349 --> 19:41.951
I DON'T FEEL LIKE WALKING.

19:41.951 --> 19:44.514
в™Є SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
TO TOUCH ME в™Є

19:44.514 --> 19:46.386
в™Є I KNOW THAT I'M IN REACH в™Є

19:46.386 --> 19:48.558
(sighs)

19:48.558 --> 19:50.320
OH. ARE YOU UP?

19:50.320 --> 19:53.192
YEAH. AND I'M DIZZY.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.195
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD GO
THROUGH ALL THAT WITH YOUR DAD

19:56.195 --> 19:58.197
JUST TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.400
NO ONE'S EVER CARED ABOUT ME
THAT MUCH BEFORE.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.302
I DO.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.274
IT'S TOO SCARY.

20:04.274 --> 20:07.277
IS THIS WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE IN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP?

20:07.277 --> 20:10.510
DON'T ANSWER. I'M JUST--
I'M FEELING TOO VULNERABLE,

20:10.510 --> 20:13.343
AND VULNERABLE WOMEN
ARE DANGEROUS.

20:13.343 --> 20:15.345
I KNOW I'M BEING RIDICULOUS,

20:15.345 --> 20:17.987
BUT YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW IT FEELS.

20:17.987 --> 20:21.251
TO BE LONELY?

20:21.251 --> 20:22.752
I THINK I DO.

20:22.752 --> 20:25.625
в™Є WE CAN'T BE SURE
WHEN IT WILL SUBSIDE в™Є

20:25.625 --> 20:27.697
(Laurie) BUT WHAT THE HELL?

20:27.697 --> 20:31.331
I GUESS SOMETIMES YOU JUST
HAVE TO GO FOR IT, RIGHT?

20:31.331 --> 20:33.563
ESPECIALLY WHEN,
MAYBE DEEP DOWN,

20:33.563 --> 20:36.266
IT'S WHAT YOU'VE WANTED
ALL ALONG.

20:36.266 --> 20:38.768
в™Є CONSUME ME LIKE A FIRE в™Є

20:38.768 --> 20:43.813
в™Є 'CAUSE I JUST WANT SOMETHING
BEAUTIFUL TO TOUCH ME в™Є

20:43.813 --> 20:46.346
в™Є I KNOW THAT I'M IN REACH в™Є

20:46.346 --> 20:48.778
в™Є 'CAUSE I AM DOWN ON MY KNEES в™Є

20:48.778 --> 20:50.750
(whispers) WOW.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.851
(moans)

20:51.851 --> 20:53.753
(gasps)

20:53.753 --> 20:55.355
в™Є OH в™Є

20:55.355 --> 20:57.357
IS IT GONNA KILL THE MOOD

20:57.357 --> 21:00.390
IF I GO BRUSH MY TEETH
AND SHAVE MY LEGS?
YEAH.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.362
OH, FINE.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.526
GOOD THING I'M NOT A BITCH.

21:36.526 --> 21:37.927
OH, YEAH.
