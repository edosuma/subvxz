<i>Truth be told,
I wasn't always such a nice guy.</i>

00:42.045 --> 00:43.947
I was strung out, down and out,

[indistinct talking]

02:40.396 --> 02:41.465
This is awesome.

02:45.369 --> 02:48.205
But I gotta ask. Why'd you guys pick me?

02:49.772 --> 02:51.809
Because I saw what you
did to those girls.

02:52.876 --> 02:54.277
What girls?

02:54.311 --> 02:57.414
In the mall. Parking lot.

02:57.447 --> 02:59.750
You said some sweet words.

02:59.782 --> 03:03.587
Led them to a quiet spot.
Kinda like this...

03:04.821 --> 03:06.657
Yeah, how could you possibly know...

03:10.926 --> 03:12.697
Blood is the conduit of the soul.

03:14.965 --> 03:18.902
Don't you get it, Jeffrey?
"No" means no.

03:24.608 --> 03:27.411
No, no, no! No, please! No, please!

you good at anything?

04:26.001 --> 04:27.403
Say what?

04:27.436 --> 04:30.407
You know. Like drawing. Woodwork?

04:30.439 --> 04:33.410
You play piano? Violin? Bassoon.

04:33.443 --> 04:37.481
You know, I played bassoon in
junior high. Oboe first, but...

04:37.513 --> 04:40.984
that was too girly,
so I went to bassoon.

04:41.017 --> 04:43.454
This wasn't part of the deal, man.

04:43.486 --> 04:45.856
People who got me out, they
said all I had to do was pay.

04:45.888 --> 04:48.725
I got the money, all right?
I got the money!

04:48.758 --> 04:49.826
It's a simple question.

04:52.962 --> 04:57.534
I used to do magic tricks.
For the guys in the yard.

04:57.566 --> 05:01.037
I should have been an escape artist.
That's how I got here, right?

05:01.071 --> 05:02.440
That's how you got here.

05:07.710 --> 05:10.513
Was your last trick
making your wife disappear?

05:11.847 --> 05:14.951
I never touched her, man. I'm innocent.

05:16.465 --> 05:18.768
Hey, get away from me, man.
Are you crazy?

05:23.926 --> 05:24.929
Little bit.

05:33.203 --> 05:34.572
Nifty trick, huh?

05:46.816 --> 05:48.119
That was intense.

05:56.592 --> 05:59.462
[music playing faintly]

06:07.503 --> 06:08.506
[woman] Rough night?

06:11.006 --> 06:14.477
That's an awful lot of
encouragement you've got there.

06:14.510 --> 06:16.112
I'm fine.

06:16.145 --> 06:18.114
Just need a little
personal space, really.

06:18.147 --> 06:21.150
Is that why you keep disappearing
into that room back there?

06:21.184 --> 06:22.753
You like asking questions?

06:25.821 --> 06:27.191
Only when I'm curious.

06:38.535 --> 06:41.871
I own this bar. That
back room is my office.

06:41.905 --> 06:44.008
[bartender] Here's your check, miss.

06:45.075 --> 06:46.043
Hold up.

07:05.227 --> 07:06.562
Nifty trick, huh?

07:06.595 --> 07:07.730
You learn that in Third Grade?

07:07.763 --> 07:09.599
Actually, I, uh...

07:09.633 --> 07:12.135
just picked it up. It's on the house.

07:13.837 --> 07:16.073
So, why do you need to
finish an entire bottle

07:16.106 --> 07:17.475
by your lonesome?

07:19.174 --> 07:22.612
In my line of work, I come
in contact with a lot of...

07:22.645 --> 07:23.746
poor souls.

07:23.780 --> 07:26.015
Sometimes, they take their toll.

07:26.049 --> 07:27.918
I don't always know how to handle it.

07:27.950 --> 07:30.787
Maybe the trick is to get to
know your own soul first.

07:31.437 --> 07:32.975
So what kinda doctor are you?

07:34.224 --> 07:36.827
- How'd you...
- Your I.D.'s right here.

07:36.859 --> 07:37.828
[chuckles]

07:39.796 --> 07:41.298
"Dr. Dakota Block."

07:41.330 --> 07:43.654
My doctorate was in Psychology.

07:45.167 --> 07:48.571
I'm actually a very good listener.

07:50.739 --> 07:52.575
I'll try and remember that, Dr. Block.

07:52.609 --> 07:56.046
Whatever's ailing you, I can assure you,

07:56.078 --> 07:57.813
it's not the end of the world.

07:57.847 --> 07:59.181

08:21.905 --> 08:23.155
[Kate] Scott?

08:33.149 --> 08:35.114
No, you're not real.

08:35.717 --> 08:37.442
You can't be real.

08:37.852 --> 08:39.022
Scott. It's me.

08:42.857 --> 08:44.561
I've been looking for you.

08:45.828 --> 08:46.996
You're dead.

08:47.030 --> 08:48.332
No, Scott.

08:50.686 --> 08:51.620
It's me.

08:56.805 --> 08:58.341
[nervous breathing]

09:08.083 --> 09:10.020
Kate, I'm so sorry.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.607
What happened to you?

09:16.059 --> 09:17.193
You have to listen to me.

09:17.227 --> 09:19.663
- I came here to warn you.
- What?

09:19.695 --> 09:21.555
Just please listen.

09:22.131 --> 09:26.044
She's gonna kill you.
If she gets a hold of you...

09:26.803 --> 09:29.072
Not yet, please. Please, please.

09:29.105 --> 09:31.241
Not yet.

09:31.274 --> 09:33.210
If you see me again, I want you to run.

09:33.242 --> 09:35.311
You run away from me, Scott, please.

09:35.344 --> 09:37.814
Just run as far away from me
as you can. Get away from this.

09:39.982 --> 09:42.151
Run. Run!

09:43.453 --> 09:44.387
Kate!

09:45.988 --> 09:48.691
[coughing]

09:55.097 --> 09:57.767
I've been looking for you.

10:08.844 --> 10:10.813

10:20.990 --> 10:23.025
Kate? Don't move!

10:23.059 --> 10:24.461
[chain rattling]

10:24.493 --> 10:28.031
You can't shoot me. I'm just a child.

10:37.372 --> 10:38.775
[Freddie] Scott!

10:44.380 --> 10:46.717
[snarling]

11:19.882 --> 11:20.917
Holy shit.

11:24.087 --> 11:26.423
I don't know how he got to her
first, but it was Kate.

11:33.395 --> 11:34.997
If I hadn't' stopped her,
she would've killed him.

11:35.030 --> 11:36.299
What do you mean "stopped her"?

11:36.332 --> 11:39.269
I shot her, just a wound.

11:39.677 --> 11:41.471
But it worked.
It's like she's still human.

11:41.504 --> 11:43.424
Maybe part of her still is.

11:43.939 --> 11:47.309
No, not the part that did this.

11:47.342 --> 11:49.478
Looks like what she did
to Santanico's girlfriend,

11:49.511 --> 11:51.466
but... she didn't finish.

11:52.381 --> 11:53.897
It's like she's sucking them dry

11:53.930 --> 11:55.919
but of their souls.

11:55.952 --> 11:59.523
That's fascinating, Spock,
but the bottom line is...

12:00.589 --> 12:02.445
this kid's a golden ticket.

12:02.991 --> 12:04.718
We can end this thing
a whole lot quicker.

12:05.251 --> 12:06.429
What do you mean, end it?

12:06.462 --> 12:08.231
It's not like he can
tell us where she's at.

12:08.264 --> 12:09.778
He doesn't have to.

12:10.567 --> 12:13.070
She came lookin' for him, remember?

12:14.437 --> 12:15.907
Yeah, she'll do it again,

12:16.371 --> 12:18.375
and when she does,
we're gonna be waiting.

12:27.989 --> 12:30.259
They were following the boy.

12:35.495 --> 12:39.048
What were you thinking,
going on your own?

12:41.702 --> 12:44.371
The girl clawed her way to the surface

12:44.404 --> 12:46.006
and found her brother,

12:46.039 --> 12:47.476
faster than you!

12:49.009 --> 12:50.312
Yes, my Queen.

12:54.048 --> 12:55.549
I'm hungry.

13:02.856 --> 13:04.458
[in Spanish] _

13:05.341 --> 13:07.341
_

13:30.952 --> 13:32.754
I hate being in her body.

13:33.955 --> 13:35.824
[man] Her body is weak...

13:36.990 --> 13:38.729
but her soul is strong.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.841
We have to crush it.

13:41.662 --> 13:43.831
I want to do it myself.

13:44.297 --> 13:46.001
With my own hands.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.136
Find him.

13:48.801 --> 13:51.074
I know exactly who to send.

14:52.232 --> 14:53.834
Nacho. All clear?

14:53.868 --> 14:55.804
- All clear, <i>jefe.</i>
<i>- Copy that.</i>

14:59.406 --> 15:00.507
All good here, <i>señor.</i>

15:01.282 --> 15:02.411
All right.

15:05.759 --> 15:07.427
What'd the prisoner do?

15:07.452 --> 15:09.053
What does it matter?

15:09.182 --> 15:10.751
I wanna know.

15:12.053 --> 15:15.222
Set his house on fire.
Killed his two kids.

15:15.255 --> 15:17.925
His own mother turned him in.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.060
Any hidden talents?

15:26.514 --> 15:27.914
[Tommy] <i>I didn't even
know he had a sister.</i>

15:28.034 --> 15:30.771
He said she died... in front of him.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.105
He's been blaming himself
all this time, but...

15:34.174 --> 15:36.010
But how could she be back?

15:38.279 --> 15:40.081
We gotta find him and help him.

15:40.114 --> 15:42.115
Sounds pretty fucked up to me.

15:42.369 --> 15:44.272
See, this is why he never told you.

15:46.740 --> 15:49.543
He thought you guys would judge him.
He wanted to start over.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.125
Tommy's right.

15:52.025 --> 15:54.596
- What? We can't just leave him.
- We didn't leave him!

15:54.629 --> 15:55.964
He left us.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.265
And now it's come
to bite him in the ass.

15:58.298 --> 16:00.236
Come sundown, we're on the move.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.173
Queen of Xibalba thinks
that we're all a plague.

16:06.613 --> 16:07.915
So what does this have to do with me?

16:08.109 --> 16:10.153
She took over your sister's body.

16:10.917 --> 16:13.621
If Kate's still in there,
you can help us get to her.

16:16.216 --> 16:18.444
Before she tried to kill me,
she told me to run.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.588
It was like she tried to warn me.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.198
So she is alive.

16:22.557 --> 16:23.679
I don't know.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.462
I don't know how any of this works, OK?

16:26.928 --> 16:29.063
- Just let me go.
- Not until you help us.

16:30.096 --> 16:31.395
You still got them swords?

16:31.428 --> 16:35.669
Traded my swords for an axe.
I'm about my music now.

16:35.702 --> 16:36.803
Your music sucks.

16:36.836 --> 16:38.290
Fuck you!

16:38.806 --> 16:40.134
If it wasn't for you and your brother,

16:40.159 --> 16:42.609
I wouldn't be in this shithole
for life, all right?

16:42.643 --> 16:44.279
So thank you for your offer,
but I'm going to go my own way.

16:44.312 --> 16:45.580
[Seth] All right, enough of this shit.

16:45.612 --> 16:46.881
We're not askin'.

16:49.015 --> 16:54.054
Now, either you are with us...
or you stay in the cage.

16:54.087 --> 16:55.177
Oh, yeah?

16:56.069 --> 16:57.404
You going to keep me in here forever?

16:57.953 --> 16:59.793
Long enough to get what we need.

17:02.510 --> 17:05.239
Come on, boys.
Let's go circle the wagons.

17:11.565 --> 17:14.282
We're trying to catch a monster,
not plan a family reunion.

17:14.308 --> 17:17.178
- But what if she's still in there?
- Richard. Stop.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.712
I know a thing or two about souls

17:18.744 --> 17:20.614
and they can hang around.

17:20.647 --> 17:22.344
What if she's trapped?
Trying to get out?

17:22.377 --> 17:25.118
She's dead, all right? How many
times do I have to say it?

17:25.151 --> 17:26.787
How can you be so sure?

17:26.820 --> 17:28.156
Just let her go.

We got company.

some kinda poison dart.</i>

23:17.773 --> 23:19.776
[screaming]

23:33.322 --> 23:35.325
[choking]

23:38.960 --> 23:40.863
[groans]

23:40.895 --> 23:42.898
If you're gonna blow me, finish the job.

23:51.774 --> 23:53.042
Don't just stand there, gimme a hand.

24:03.786 --> 24:05.121
Come on. All right.

24:07.088 --> 24:09.090
Lemme check that one.

24:09.123 --> 24:10.727
Hey!

24:13.261 --> 24:15.263
Jesus Christ, Richard.

24:17.114 --> 24:20.001
- Just... hang on!
- Easy. You gotta hold me up!

24:20.035 --> 24:22.971
One more inch and I'm a pile of ash.

24:23.005 --> 24:24.641
'Kay, got him. You got him?

24:26.709 --> 24:27.343
You ready?

24:27.375 --> 24:28.644
Yeah.

24:33.315 --> 24:34.651
[groans]

24:36.317 --> 24:39.141
So... good news.

24:40.088 --> 24:44.359
These things can be hurt,
at least with these blades.

24:46.995 --> 24:47.930
Xibalban blades.

24:50.431 --> 24:52.468
Wait, your knife is Xibalban?

24:52.500 --> 24:54.714
Yeah, man. Check out
the similar carvings.

24:55.154 --> 24:57.006
Plus, it hurt that beast
at the fight club.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.700
Now we know why.

24:58.732 --> 25:01.911
These things put a bigger hurt on
Culebras than regular weapons.

25:02.823 --> 25:05.561
I'm not healing as fast.

25:05.586 --> 25:07.021
And check out these glyphs.

25:08.816 --> 25:10.353
Burt walked me through it the other day.

25:12.232 --> 25:15.303
<i>Ocelotl.</i> Jaguar Warriors.

25:15.490 --> 25:18.927
They're like <i>Delta Force.</i>
Xibalban Chuck Norrises.

25:18.960 --> 25:23.298
They guarded the Sun God as he
journeyed through the Underworld,

25:23.332 --> 25:26.002
clearing a path for the
Sun to rise again.

25:27.536 --> 25:31.063
Brasa. Brasa's the Sun God.

25:31.873 --> 25:33.910
And these are his junkyard dogs.

25:36.071 --> 25:39.074
<i>"They are demon warriors
who hunt their prey</i>

25:39.099 --> 25:40.935
by the rhythms of their heart,

25:41.083 --> 25:44.085
reading it like a fingerprint
to their souls."

25:44.118 --> 25:46.021
Oh my God, who writes this shit?

25:52.427 --> 25:54.063
We still have no idea
how to kill these things.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.364
First, we gotta find 'em.

25:55.396 --> 25:57.265
If Scott leads them back to the band,

25:57.298 --> 25:59.401
I've got the license plate
number to their tour bus.

25:59.433 --> 26:00.687
I can call it in.

26:00.719 --> 26:03.505
Well, what the fuck
are you waitin' for? Go!

26:09.111 --> 26:11.113
I don't think he likes
taking orders from me.

26:11.145 --> 26:12.313
Little secret?

26:12.346 --> 26:13.382
Mmm.

26:13.414 --> 26:14.911
Nobody does.

26:15.483 --> 26:18.386
If you want to do this yourself,
you have to be ready.

26:18.420 --> 26:19.388
I am ready.

26:20.255 --> 26:21.090
Not quite.

26:23.525 --> 26:25.261
And did you find the boy?

26:28.497 --> 26:32.435
Honesty, my Queen, it makes me
your most loyal servant.

26:35.269 --> 26:38.139
You have no idea what it takes.

26:38.336 --> 26:40.276
Drowning out every single one
of her thoughts,

26:40.308 --> 26:45.314
every waking moment of every day,
only to lose control of her, again.

26:47.703 --> 26:49.275
Then use it, My Queen.

26:50.251 --> 26:51.052
Use that anger.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.056
[groans]

27:01.075 --> 27:03.221
So when I say I'm ready,

27:03.966 --> 27:05.535
I am ready.

27:42.030 --> 27:43.866
You had us scared to death.

27:43.898 --> 27:46.027
You wanna tell us what
the hell's goin' on, Scotty?

27:47.261 --> 27:50.088
Look, we should get going, guys.
I'll tell you on the way.

27:50.226 --> 27:52.729
Hey, you got troubles,

27:53.088 --> 27:54.923
you can tell us right here, right now.

27:54.957 --> 27:56.226
We're a family, you remember that?

27:56.258 --> 27:57.693
He's right, Scott.

27:58.794 --> 28:00.063
Somebody's after you, right?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.096
Your sister?

28:01.130 --> 28:04.529
Something else. Something bad.

28:04.967 --> 28:06.636
And they want you dead, don't they?

28:07.903 --> 28:09.137
We have to keep on moving.

28:09.737 --> 28:11.089
Trust me.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.977
Hey, you don't call the shots anymore.

28:14.009 --> 28:15.778
[girl] Tommy, what are you doing?

28:15.810 --> 28:18.146
- It's been a long time coming.
- Tommy, don't do this.

28:18.180 --> 28:20.682
Oh, you expect us
to pay for your mistakes?

28:20.716 --> 28:22.785
Those people that I was with,
they say they're my friends,

28:22.817 --> 28:24.753
but they're not. You are.

28:25.402 --> 28:28.091
All of you. You guys are all I...

28:29.557 --> 28:31.094
What are you gonna do now?

28:32.795 --> 28:34.529
Same shit as always?

28:35.998 --> 28:37.267
It stops now.

29:10.665 --> 29:13.769
[heavy breathing]

29:19.075 --> 29:20.808
She tried to save me,

29:21.876 --> 29:23.812
but I couldn't be
what she wanted me to be.

29:23.845 --> 29:27.784
He learned to control his cravings.
You could learn, too.

29:27.816 --> 29:31.988
We... just have to find a way
without hurting innocent people.

29:35.438 --> 29:36.793
You know what's fucked up?

29:38.794 --> 29:41.064
After she was gone, that's
exactly what I became.

29:41.096 --> 29:43.193
That's why I formed this band.

29:43.798 --> 29:45.649
I wanted to save all of us.

29:46.522 --> 29:48.270
What happened to your sister, Scott?

29:49.146 --> 29:50.073
What did you do to her?

29:50.105 --> 29:51.007
- [man] <i>Kate, Don't! No!</i>
- [gunshot]

29:58.681 --> 29:59.816
[sobbing]

29:59.848 --> 30:01.183
I sent her to hell,

30:02.684 --> 30:04.338
now she's back to punish me.

30:04.653 --> 30:06.221
[distant roar]

30:06.255 --> 30:08.091
What the hell is that?

30:08.124 --> 30:11.827
Tommy was right. You guys have to go.
Here, take my bike.

30:11.861 --> 30:13.763
- You can't be anywhere near me.
- Scott, why?

30:13.796 --> 30:15.798
Because I'm a dead man.

30:33.608 --> 30:35.011
We all have a hidden talent.

30:37.118 --> 30:38.220
[screams]

30:39.989 --> 30:41.223
Yours is fighting.

30:46.261 --> 30:49.865
To be honest, I don't really think
we stand a chance against you guys.

30:52.334 --> 30:55.739
[Seth on radio] <i>Richard. You copy?</i>

30:58.173 --> 30:59.201
Go ahead.

30:59.226 --> 31:01.734
<i>Ranger Danger's got
a fix on the party bus.</i>

31:02.944 --> 31:03.946
I'll be right there.

31:14.457 --> 31:17.427
[screeching in pain]

31:27.190 --> 31:31.028
[song playing on radio]

31:36.198 --> 31:38.701
All right, if I can get close
enough, I can cut her hand,

31:38.734 --> 31:41.503
we can trade blood. I can see
if Kate's still in there.

31:41.537 --> 31:43.473
[sighs loudly]

31:46.675 --> 31:49.311
You remember that German shepherd
that lived a few doors down from us,

31:49.782 --> 31:53.551
- the one you took in?
- Peaches, yeah.

31:53.582 --> 31:54.856
You took her from the neighbors,

31:54.881 --> 31:57.119
'cause they always kept her chained up.
Remember that?

31:57.153 --> 31:59.423
- I was so bummed when she ran away.
- Yeah, well...

32:00.790 --> 32:02.326
She didn't run away.

32:06.462 --> 32:08.355
I found her in the orchard one day.

32:09.232 --> 32:12.002
She was all bitten up by rats.
Covered in blood,

32:12.034 --> 32:15.571
foamin' at the mouth, all right?
So, I ran, I got Dad,

32:15.605 --> 32:16.606
and I...

32:18.186 --> 32:20.356
Are you fucking with me right now?

32:20.542 --> 32:23.045
- Dad shot Peaches?
- No.

32:25.481 --> 32:26.282
I did.

32:28.784 --> 32:31.088
Dad decided it was a teachable moment.

32:32.789 --> 32:34.257
It was quick...

32:35.524 --> 32:36.525
OK? But the point is...

32:36.550 --> 32:38.068
The point is what?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.874
- That Kate's a fucking dog now?
- No. She's gone.

32:43.604 --> 32:45.607
Whatever's left needs to be put down.

32:59.581 --> 33:00.759
I gotta be honest.

33:02.023 --> 33:04.454
It's not exactly the family
reunion that I dreamt about.

33:04.486 --> 33:06.455
Well, it's just you and me now.

33:08.075 --> 33:11.046
And your sister. She's watching.

33:31.547 --> 33:32.983
I could get used to this.

33:35.518 --> 33:38.254
I got eyes on 'em. Brasa's here, too.

33:38.287 --> 33:40.090
[on radio] <i>But none of his warriors.</i>

33:40.123 --> 33:41.691
Bet they got eyes and ears
on us right now.

33:41.723 --> 33:43.393
Yeah, we should split up.

34:07.717 --> 34:09.652
Well, you wanted a reunion...

34:09.684 --> 34:11.654
you'll get it. In hell.

34:34.141 --> 34:35.612
I was hoping I'd run into you again.

34:40.849 --> 34:43.520
[both grunting]

35:02.904 --> 35:04.240
[gunshots]

35:26.828 --> 35:29.965
Now, your sister gets to
watch you die...

35:29.998 --> 35:32.201
like the coward you are.

35:43.980 --> 35:46.198
Your special power. How lovely.

35:46.648 --> 35:48.752
That's a gift from Xibalba.

35:49.719 --> 35:50.854
You can have it back!

36:10.840 --> 36:12.442
[groans in pain]

36:21.016 --> 36:23.856
What can I say? I picked
up a few new tricks.

36:58.293 --> 37:00.163
Another time, Gecko.

37:17.672 --> 37:20.909
You know, Peacekeeper.
I don't understand you.

37:22.258 --> 37:23.260
These Geckos...

37:25.980 --> 37:31.720
They kill your father figure,
and you promise vengeance.

37:32.642 --> 37:34.244
How could you betray that?

37:41.096 --> 37:43.432
Earl McGraw said hell was coming.

37:45.621 --> 37:46.923
He would've hated you.

38:17.065 --> 38:18.667
Fuck me.

38:31.525 --> 38:32.928
Die, little boy.

38:38.339 --> 38:39.540
[Seth] Let him go.

38:39.654 --> 38:40.622
[gun clicks]

38:46.027 --> 38:47.896
[coughing]

38:47.929 --> 38:50.216
You have really fucked up
my life, you know that?

38:51.699 --> 38:53.943
What was it that you said to her?

38:54.770 --> 38:56.505
Stick with me and you'll make it through

38:56.538 --> 38:58.707
without any bumps or scrapes, right?

39:00.041 --> 39:02.444
Don't do it, Seth! Don't!

39:02.478 --> 39:04.607
No, come a bit closer.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.528
I wanna taste your soul.

39:06.748 --> 39:09.651
Sorry. Don't have one.

39:14.790 --> 39:16.958
OK, she's hurt.
We can just take her with us!

39:16.991 --> 39:20.829
Do it, Seth. Please. Shoot me, please.
I can't do this anymore.

39:20.862 --> 39:23.732
I can't hold... Please...

39:24.500 --> 39:25.768
No don't.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.737
- No... Don't do it! Don't do it!
- Wait, Seth! Don't touch her!

39:31.739 --> 39:35.578
You lied. You do have a soul.

40:05.875 --> 40:08.478
[Richie] <i>You never really know
what's inside of a person...</i>

40:09.135 --> 40:12.221
People are strange, like the song says.

40:13.014 --> 40:16.051
[song playing in the background]

40:16.085 --> 40:17.643
I'm gonna say something.

40:18.654 --> 40:20.363
Might sound a little weird.

40:22.536 --> 40:23.844
I have a gift.

40:25.027 --> 40:27.303
I can sense what's inside of people.

40:28.264 --> 40:30.083
I can read their souls.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.735
Sure that's a gift?

40:32.768 --> 40:35.237
I think it's gonna get me
in trouble one of these days.

40:35.270 --> 40:39.908
I'm usually attracted to the dark souls.
They fascinate me.

40:39.942 --> 40:41.744
I hope that doesn't frighten you.

40:44.045 --> 40:46.261
I've always been a clean-cut girl, so...

40:46.648 --> 40:48.951
I can't imagine what you see in me.

40:48.983 --> 40:53.021
I'm not sure, but I'd
like to find out more.

40:57.713 --> 40:59.481
Where are you parked?

40:59.506 --> 41:01.175
Just a little further here.

41:02.744 --> 41:04.762
I have a confession to make.

41:06.201 --> 41:09.239
There is something dark
I've been hiding inside of me.

41:11.206 --> 41:13.742
My father died a few years ago.

41:13.775 --> 41:16.011
I'm actually still recovering from it.

41:16.045 --> 41:18.882
It's taken me a long time
to even face it, but...

41:20.248 --> 41:21.783
tonight, I'm think ready.

41:23.117 --> 41:24.520
What can I do?

41:28.690 --> 41:29.658
You can hold this.

41:34.735 --> 41:35.603
Open it.

41:38.032 --> 41:40.270
There's a picture of my father in there.

41:47.568 --> 41:48.603
You see...

41:50.958 --> 41:54.276
the cops will think
that you tried to mug me.

41:55.016 --> 41:56.627
But the truth is...

41:57.186 --> 41:59.188
you stole more than
my wallet, didn't you...

42:00.889 --> 42:02.959
you sick son of a bitch?

42:04.226 --> 42:06.662
- Dr. Block?
- It's McGraw.

42:06.695 --> 42:09.865
And tonight, my father
will finally rest in peace.

42:09.898 --> 42:10.833
Just... don't do...

42:15.170 --> 42:16.271
[thud]

42:27.742 --> 42:29.511
Whe...

42:31.753 --> 42:33.121
Son of a bitch.
