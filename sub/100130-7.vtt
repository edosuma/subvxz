WEBVTT

00:04.449 --> 00:07.122
Legend holds that buried
somewhere in the Iraqi desert

00:07.289 --> 00:09.678
is a fabled book penned
by ancient mystics

00:09.849 --> 00:11.805
known as the Akashic Records,

00:11.969 --> 00:16.759
believed to be a written account of all
significant events throughout time.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.044
Powerful stuff.

00:18.569 --> 00:22.084
If someone were to get their hands
on that, they could win the lottery.

00:22.249 --> 00:24.160
Or at least get tenure.

00:24.929 --> 00:28.638
To know the future brings,
obviously, ultimate power.

00:28.809 --> 00:32.244
Which is why everyone from Herod to
Hitler has been looking for the records.

00:32.409 --> 00:34.206
But to find them...

00:34.369 --> 00:37.725
To find them, one needs a map.

00:38.769 --> 00:41.442
This tablet, found
in the lvory Coast last year,

00:41.609 --> 00:43.327
is believed to be the very map.

00:43.489 --> 00:48.085
Although the engravings are of a lost
language so far indecipherable

00:48.249 --> 00:50.160
to even scholars like myself.

00:50.329 --> 00:52.524
But we're close.

00:53.249 --> 00:57.288
Whoever can decipher them first will
know the exact latitude and longitude

00:57.449 --> 00:59.519
- of the Akashic Records.
- My God, that's it.

01:01.209 --> 01:03.643
- Excuse me?
- No, no. Excuse me.

01:05.529 --> 01:09.078
If you'll follow me, I'll show you the
next exhibit, which is quite interesting.

01:14.249 --> 01:16.922
I cracked it. Dad,
the rest of the map,

01:17.089 --> 01:20.081
it was a transposition sequence,
just like you said.

01:20.249 --> 01:25.243
And it's all in here. The location
of the Akashic Records.

01:25.569 --> 01:30.120
Now, they're gonna come after me
just like they came after you.

01:30.289 --> 01:32.405
But I'm gonna be ready
for them, Dad.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.767
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:37.449 --> 01:39.758
- How's he doing today?
- The same.

01:40.169 --> 01:43.286
Thanks for always keeping his room
so cheerful. I really appreciate it.

01:43.689 --> 01:47.602
Oh, don't mention it. I mean, for all
we know, he knows they're here too.

01:47.769 --> 01:49.919
Isn't that why you keep
talking to him?

01:50.089 --> 01:52.398
Eric, can I speak to you
alone, please?

01:54.569 --> 01:57.606
Yeah. Outside.

02:00.009 --> 02:04.321
- I'm not moving him, Dr Stone.
- Eric, it's been six weeks.

02:04.489 --> 02:07.287
This facility is not designed
for long-term maintenance.

02:07.449 --> 02:10.566
Maintenance? That's my father
you're talking about.

02:10.729 --> 02:13.562
And he's gonna get better.
And he's gonna stay here.

02:19.089 --> 02:20.158
Sorry.

02:25.049 --> 02:26.528
Eric, wait!

02:36.089 --> 02:38.284
- I think Jack's a warlock.
- Who?

02:38.449 --> 02:41.964
Jack. Jack Sheridan, the
Internet-auction guy I met, remember?

02:42.129 --> 02:44.359
I went to go get coffee,
he was standing in front of me,

02:44.529 --> 02:46.679
and then I went straight
to the newsstand, and wham,

02:46.849 --> 02:48.726
he was right there
reading a magazine.

02:48.889 --> 02:51.164
He went from one place to another
in the blink of an eye.

02:51.329 --> 02:52.808
- You think he blinked.
- Well, yeah.

02:52.969 --> 02:55.164
I mean, that's what warlocks do,
right? Where's Phoebe?

02:55.329 --> 02:57.160
She's volunteering
at the convalescent hospital.

02:57.329 --> 02:58.603
Great.

02:58.769 --> 03:01.920
Wait. You have to know
if there's a warlock test.

03:02.089 --> 03:04.159
Me? Why would I know?

03:04.329 --> 03:05.967
Well, l...

03:06.129 --> 03:08.404
I mean, you are a warlock magnet.

03:08.649 --> 03:10.128
Am I never going to
live Jeremy down?

03:10.289 --> 03:12.280
You know, you had that
Rex-and-Hannah thing at work.

03:12.449 --> 03:15.839
Okay, you've got them in your love life,
I've got them at the water cooler.

03:16.889 --> 03:18.959
- What's up with the suitcase?
- A little overnighter.

03:19.129 --> 03:20.926
Dan's friend is getting married
in Tahoe,

03:21.089 --> 03:23.557
and Dan invited me to come along.

03:23.729 --> 03:27.039
In-the-same-hotel
in-the-same-bed sort of thing?

03:27.209 --> 03:29.245
That has yet to be decided.

03:29.809 --> 03:34.121
Oh, so then this is just
tennis outfit, right?

03:34.289 --> 03:35.768
Give it. Thank you.

03:35.929 --> 03:38.921
I mean, you did test him, right?
You know that he's not a warlock?

03:39.089 --> 03:41.478
He's not a warlock.
No cats have hissed at him,

03:41.649 --> 03:44.117
he has not blinked, he has not
tried to kill me or my sisters

03:44.289 --> 03:47.087
and steal our powers, which,
as you know, is a key indicator.

03:47.249 --> 03:48.921
I need the Book of Shadows.

03:52.689 --> 03:54.805
Oh, I'll get it.

04:00.209 --> 04:02.165
- Hello, you.
- Hi.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.843
I was wondering if maybe
we could get an earlier start.

04:05.009 --> 04:06.920
You know, miss traffic,

04:07.089 --> 04:09.080
get there quicker so we could
have enough time to...

04:09.489 --> 04:12.526
- Relax?
- "Relax" is a good word.

04:15.169 --> 04:16.761
Any chance you could be ready
in an hour?

04:17.289 --> 04:18.846
Yes, every chance.

04:23.369 --> 04:25.121
I wonder what her problem is.

04:27.649 --> 04:29.526
I gotta go now.

04:29.929 --> 04:31.157
Bye.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.925
Prue! Did you find
that warlock test yet?

06:22.689 --> 06:25.647
Nineteen warlock-specific
death spells and not one test.

06:25.809 --> 06:28.243
What if it's a conspiracy?
Jack and Dan working together,

06:28.409 --> 06:32.402
sweet-talking, and the whole time,
they're figuring out how to kill us.

06:32.569 --> 06:34.878
- Okay, now you're getting paranoid.
- Well, how can we not,

06:35.049 --> 06:37.609
with warlocks and demons coming
out of the woodwork all the time?

06:37.769 --> 06:40.408
- It's a wonder we trust anybody.
- We don't.

06:41.249 --> 06:43.524
- Here it is.
- "To hear secret thoughts"?

06:43.689 --> 06:45.725
We can hear Jack and Dan's
thoughts just long enough

06:45.889 --> 06:47.720
to confirm or deny our suspicions.

06:47.889 --> 06:49.845
- No personal gain.
- Purely for protection.

06:57.169 --> 06:58.761
Okay.

06:59.369 --> 07:01.724
As flame lights shadow
And truth ends fear

07:01.889 --> 07:04.767
Open locked thoughts
To my mind's willing ear

07:04.929 --> 07:07.602
May the smoke from this candle
Into everywhere creep

07:07.769 --> 07:11.887
Bringing innermost voices
To my mind in speech

07:14.609 --> 07:18.238
- Hey, she's wearing my lipstick.
- What, I can't borrow your lipstick?

07:19.369 --> 07:23.647
- I didn't say that Prue, I thought it.
- Whatever. Just learn to share.

07:23.809 --> 07:25.561
I heard that.

07:26.009 --> 07:28.569
- This could be very dangerous.
- Stay calm. Calm down.

07:28.729 --> 07:30.367
Book of Shadows,
needles and warlocks.

07:30.529 --> 07:32.599
And Eric's in trouble.
Find out who. Find out what.

07:32.769 --> 07:34.885
The hospital hottie?

07:35.329 --> 07:36.318
What?

07:37.489 --> 07:39.957
How's Eric? Did you see him today?

07:40.609 --> 07:43.248
Why is the Book of Shadows
down here, girls?

07:43.409 --> 07:46.287
- Jack blinked.
- And Kit hissed at Dan.

07:46.489 --> 07:48.400
Right. And we think that
they may be warlocks,

07:48.569 --> 07:52.562
so we were looking for a test
so that we could test them.

07:52.729 --> 07:55.482
- Hello, paranoid?
- We are not.

07:55.849 --> 07:58.647
Able to find a spell
in the Book of Shadows.

07:58.809 --> 08:00.720
Well, just prick him.
Warlocks don't bleed.

08:00.889 --> 08:02.845
So if there's no blood,
you got your answer.

08:03.009 --> 08:04.362
- Who knew?
- Phoebe did.

08:04.529 --> 08:06.804
- The spell, don't tell her.
- Should we reverse it?

08:06.969 --> 08:08.846
Not until we know if they're really...

08:12.209 --> 08:14.359
- Are you two okay?
- So how's Eric?

08:14.529 --> 08:16.918
- Has he asked you out yet?
- No, but he's in trouble.

08:17.089 --> 08:18.522
I had a premonition today.

08:18.689 --> 08:21.999
A demon, or a warlock, maybe,
with a needle thingy on his finger,

08:22.169 --> 08:23.921
and he was sticking it
into Eric's head.

08:24.089 --> 08:26.398
So I came home to see
what we're up against.

08:26.569 --> 08:28.480
You guys go deal with Jack and Dan,

08:28.649 --> 08:32.198
and I'll look on the Internet,
and I'll tell you if I find anything.

08:32.409 --> 08:33.808
Great, we're surrounded
by warlocks.

08:33.969 --> 08:35.561
Next time, get your own
damn lipstick.

08:36.169 --> 08:38.000
- I heard that.
- I love you.

08:38.249 --> 08:40.046
Bite me.

08:51.249 --> 08:54.605
- Prue.
- Jack, you actually wear that to work?

08:55.329 --> 08:56.728
Feisty, feisty.

08:56.889 --> 08:59.084
Well, when work puts me
in front of an online server

08:59.249 --> 09:04.118
handling 5 million online
auction hits a day, yeah, I do.

09:04.809 --> 09:07.562
- So, what's the emergency?
- Verschwang.

09:07.729 --> 09:09.208
My what?

09:09.369 --> 09:11.929
Verschwang Publications,
the German conglomerate.

09:12.089 --> 09:14.319
You handled their CEO's
bronze-miniature collection

09:14.489 --> 09:15.842
for the Internet auction, right?

09:16.209 --> 09:18.882
Be careful. She suspects.

09:19.049 --> 09:20.721
Yeah, of course.

09:20.889 --> 09:23.687
Well, I need some bronzes
checked out. Who did your validation?

09:26.689 --> 09:27.917
Validation?

09:29.329 --> 09:32.719
You do have people's collections
validated, don't you?

09:32.889 --> 09:36.404
Mostly, I put people in graves,
or I incinerate them.

09:37.449 --> 09:39.246
Oh, yeah.

09:39.409 --> 09:43.004
It was Walt Potock at Berkeley
School of Design. He's the best.

09:44.329 --> 09:47.321
If she finds out I'm lying,
she's gonna die.

09:48.089 --> 09:51.240
Well, you know what,
I'm a little late. Gotta go.

09:51.649 --> 09:53.446
Good to see you again.

09:54.809 --> 09:57.118
You're dying first.

09:59.969 --> 10:01.607
You ready?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.760
Can you come in?

10:10.369 --> 10:13.122
- Where's your suitcase?
- Upstairs.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.127
I see.

10:17.449 --> 10:22.477
Cold feet. She's backing out. It's okay.
Don't push it. Just don't push it.

10:22.649 --> 10:25.243
Look, don't move.

10:25.449 --> 10:28.998
Okay, this is gonna hurt me
a lot more than it's gonna hurt you.

10:33.169 --> 10:35.046
Piper, we have to get to Eric.

10:35.289 --> 10:36.722
What's the matter?

10:36.889 --> 10:40.484
He didn't bleed. He's not bleeding.
There's no blood. There's nothing.

10:41.329 --> 10:45.447
Yeah. Of course he's not bleeding.
He's frozen, his blood is frozen.

10:45.609 --> 10:46.803
Yeah. Right.

10:46.969 --> 10:49.164
- Okay, go back upstairs. Go.
- Yeah.

10:52.209 --> 10:53.278
Okay.

10:57.689 --> 10:59.884
- What the hell was that?
- You're bleeding.

11:00.049 --> 11:01.960
It's... Just a little bit.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.847
Love her touch.

11:04.529 --> 11:06.804
If she doesn't wanna go,
it's okay. Don't force it.

11:08.329 --> 11:13.084
- Dan, listen. I really want to go.
- But?

11:14.609 --> 11:17.362
- He's bleeding.
- He's lucky.

11:17.529 --> 11:19.599
Hi. Listen, Dan,
I have to borrow Piper

11:19.769 --> 11:22.044
for just a little while,
but I'll have her back soon, okay?

11:22.209 --> 11:24.564
- Nice butt.
- Hey!

11:26.289 --> 11:30.123
Hey, you hang in there.
And I'll be back in time.

11:30.409 --> 11:33.367
- Yeah, I hope so.
- Later.

11:43.409 --> 11:47.322
That's what's scaring Kit.
It's... You got hornets.

11:47.489 --> 11:51.084
- It's probably what stung me too.
- Yeah, probably.

11:51.249 --> 11:53.444
Okay, gotta go.

11:53.609 --> 11:55.565
Don't leave without me.

11:56.929 --> 11:59.204
Okay, gotta go, gotta go.

12:09.889 --> 12:13.120
They're called "collectors."
They're a warlock...

12:13.289 --> 12:15.723
They're a warlock breed
that drains knowledge

12:15.889 --> 12:17.959
out of people's brains
with that weird finger I saw.

12:18.129 --> 12:19.721
The Book didn't say
how to vanquish them?

12:19.889 --> 12:22.642
No, it just said, "Their hunger
for knowledge is your ally."

12:22.809 --> 12:25.277
Okay, whatever that means.
Are you sure this is where he lives?

12:25.449 --> 12:27.883
That's what the hospital record said.
5D, here it is.

12:34.529 --> 12:36.406
Piper!

12:37.889 --> 12:39.527
Okey-dokey.

12:39.849 --> 12:44.161
Oh, my God. That is Dr Stone,
Eric's dad's doctor.

12:44.769 --> 12:47.920
All right, let's get him out of here.
We'll figure out what they want later.

12:48.089 --> 12:49.078
Okay, ready?

12:49.249 --> 12:51.205
- You do a little thingy.
- Okay.

12:55.049 --> 12:56.641
Get out of here! Get him out of here!

13:01.249 --> 13:02.602
Get back.

13:07.929 --> 13:09.647
Oh, my God.

13:16.689 --> 13:18.919
Okay, let's go, let's go!

13:32.929 --> 13:35.363
They put my father in the hospital.
They took his mind.

13:35.529 --> 13:38.601
- Who do you think they are?
- NSA, CIA, who knows?

13:39.929 --> 13:44.002
Somebody in bulletproof vests.
The question is, who are you?

13:44.289 --> 13:45.608
Friends.

13:45.769 --> 13:48.408
Yeah, right.
They're after the Akashic Records too.

13:50.169 --> 13:53.206
- What are the Akashic Records?
- I knew it.

13:53.369 --> 13:54.722
Wait, what did you just say?

13:55.049 --> 13:56.801
The Akashic Records,
what are they?

13:56.969 --> 13:58.880
- You tell me.
- I'll tell you.

13:59.049 --> 14:01.438
They're a book of ancient prophecies.
The future of the world,

14:01.609 --> 14:04.442
down to the smallest detail,
hidden away and lost for centuries.

14:04.609 --> 14:07.077
- But it's just a legend. How did you...?
- You're well informed.

14:07.729 --> 14:10.721
- I read a lot. How did you know that?
- I'll tell you later.

14:10.889 --> 14:12.641
So they want those records.
And they want Eric

14:12.809 --> 14:14.367
because he knows
how to find them, right?

14:14.529 --> 14:17.999
- Who are you people?
- What if it's not a legend?

14:18.169 --> 14:21.047
Say they're real. What happens
if the bad guys get these records?

14:21.209 --> 14:25.680
And they use the future against us?
No more us, the bad guys win.

14:27.049 --> 14:29.722
- I gotta get my father out of there.
- No, wait, Eric.

14:29.889 --> 14:31.766
He's stuck in the hospital.
Dr Stone's in on it.

14:31.929 --> 14:34.124
Eric, it is not about
your father anymore.

14:34.289 --> 14:36.245
It's about you,
especially if they think you know

14:36.409 --> 14:39.640
- how to find the Akashic Records.
- Try and stop me.

14:44.609 --> 14:45.598
How?

14:48.369 --> 14:50.360
- Entertaining guest, I see.
- Hi.

14:51.369 --> 14:53.963
Piper? Could you help me out a little?

14:56.889 --> 14:59.244
Who's the cute boy?

14:59.409 --> 15:01.081
It's Eric, from the hospital.

15:01.249 --> 15:03.968
Two warlocks called collectors
want what's in his brain:

15:04.129 --> 15:05.687
The location of the Akashic Records.

15:05.849 --> 15:07.805
A lost text that predicts
all future events.

15:07.969 --> 15:09.846
Collectors get it, the world's a goner.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.124
- It's a...
- It's a lost text

15:11.609 --> 15:12.883
that predicts all future events.

15:13.049 --> 15:15.085
The collectors get it,
the world's a goner, I know.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.843
Okay, does someone wanna tell me
what's going on here?

15:18.289 --> 15:20.200
Have to tell her now.

15:20.369 --> 15:22.758
Okay. Phoebe, see,

15:22.929 --> 15:25.807
Piper and I didn't really know
about the whole pricking thing

15:25.969 --> 15:27.197
to expose a warlock.

15:27.369 --> 15:31.362
So we sort of cast a little hearing-
thoughts spell just to find things out.

15:31.529 --> 15:33.042
Oh, a hearing-thoughts spell.

15:33.209 --> 15:36.645
- Dan's clean, by the way.
- Glad to hear it. Jack's not.

15:36.809 --> 15:39.084
Wait, are you guys thinking
something about me right now?

15:39.609 --> 15:41.645
No. Does Eric know
witches, warlocks?

15:41.809 --> 15:43.640
No, he thinks it's
a government conspiracy.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.367
How do you know Jack's a warlock?

15:45.529 --> 15:47.804
I heard his thoughts,
and they are bad. Really bad.

15:48.289 --> 15:51.759
You know, graves, dead people,
burnt bodies.

15:51.929 --> 15:53.885
- Did you prick him?
- No, that's why I need Piper.

15:54.049 --> 15:57.041
Freeze him, prick him and then
vanquish him if necessary.

15:57.209 --> 15:58.324
Where did you get that?

15:58.849 --> 16:02.205
Remember the troubled priest
with the warlock brothers?

16:02.649 --> 16:05.402
Well, they left this behind,
and I've sort of hung on to it,

16:05.569 --> 16:07.480
just in case we needed it
for future warlock use.

16:07.649 --> 16:10.607
Wow, it's been a while,
but it seems like they're everywhere.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.442
Okay, you two go to it. I'll stay here.

16:13.609 --> 16:16.919
- What if the collectors show up?
- Well, just get back before they do.

16:17.369 --> 16:19.644
And don't lose that dagger.

16:22.289 --> 16:24.564
We have to go kill a warlock
while she sits on some guy's...

16:24.729 --> 16:27.163
Hey, hey, hey!

16:27.329 --> 16:29.047
You heard that?

16:29.929 --> 16:33.365
Like I need a hearing-thoughts spell
to know what you're thinking.

16:33.529 --> 16:35.440
Stop it.

16:37.129 --> 16:38.687
Now, are you gonna behave?

16:40.369 --> 16:42.599
Do I have a choice?

16:43.289 --> 16:44.768
No.

16:54.529 --> 16:56.759
- Did you find Eric?
- No.

16:56.929 --> 16:59.966
Not good. He's being protected
by a time-freezing witch.

17:00.129 --> 17:02.324
And Bruce Lee's little sister.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.321
The Akashic Records
are within our reach.

17:05.489 --> 17:09.277
It's going to be very difficult to drain
his brain if they know what we're after.

17:10.888 --> 17:12.607
Not to worry.

17:12.769 --> 17:16.921
We'll get into his mind
through his heart.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.047
Very nice.

17:27.209 --> 17:29.040
There she is, hard at work.

17:32.009 --> 17:35.126
- I'm glad you called. Can I come in?
- Sure.

17:35.489 --> 17:38.049
Stay focused. Get it over with.

17:38.489 --> 17:40.161
Freeze him.

17:41.729 --> 17:44.527
The dagger, his hand,
just kind of poke him.

17:49.689 --> 17:52.567
- He's not bleeding.
- He's frozen.

17:52.729 --> 17:56.358
Yeah. Okay, okay, okay.
Wait a minute.

17:57.369 --> 17:58.688
Okay.

17:59.449 --> 18:00.928
Hey, any survivors?

18:08.449 --> 18:11.088
- Okay, there's two of them.
- Twin warlocks?

18:11.249 --> 18:13.365
Or maybe they're just twins.

18:14.009 --> 18:18.605
Okay, you unfreeze them.
If that prick doesn't bleed,

18:18.769 --> 18:20.964
- then that one's dead too.
- All right.

18:21.129 --> 18:22.767
All right, let them go.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.444
What? What's the matter,
she bite you?

18:26.609 --> 18:27.678
You shouldn't be here.

18:27.849 --> 18:29.840
Come on, man, I couldn't let you
take all the blame.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.840
He's bleeding.

18:32.209 --> 18:34.803
All right, this is my sister Piper.
Which one of you jerks is Jack?

18:37.129 --> 18:40.485
I'm the jerk.
This is my twin brother, Jeff.

18:40.649 --> 18:45.677
Hey. Nice to meet you. Look,
sorry for the little tap dance earlier.

18:46.769 --> 18:50.159
So, what exactly was it that you guys
were trying to prove?

18:50.329 --> 18:53.127
It's just a little something
we used to do growing up.

18:53.289 --> 18:55.757
Yeah, so when one of us would
take an interest in someone...

18:55.929 --> 18:57.203
Don't get the wrong idea.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.247
So you'd send the other one
to check out the merchandise,

19:00.409 --> 19:03.321
- sort of kick the tires?
- Crude, but accurate.

19:03.649 --> 19:05.560
Still doesn't explain
why he wanted to kill me.

19:05.729 --> 19:06.798
Good point.

19:06.969 --> 19:10.359
So, Jeff, what is it
that you do for a living?

19:10.809 --> 19:13.118
Oh, great, this should be
a conversation stopper.

19:13.289 --> 19:17.407
I own a mortuary.
Actually, a whole chain of them.

19:18.089 --> 19:21.240
- Mortuaries.
- Put them in graves, set them on fire.

19:22.969 --> 19:27.406
You know, you two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

19:28.649 --> 19:30.685
That's for thinking that you
could get away with it.

19:30.849 --> 19:33.921
And that's for thinking
that you wouldn't get slapped.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.647
Piper.

19:42.169 --> 19:43.761
I approve.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.368
How did you know to be there
to help me?

19:55.209 --> 19:58.326
- That's a long story.
- Wait. Shorten it.

20:00.169 --> 20:01.966
I have this gift.

20:02.129 --> 20:05.246
I sort of know when things are gonna
happen, if there's gonna be trouble.

20:05.809 --> 20:08.960
- How?
- Just something I was born with.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.525
So you don't work
for some government agency?

20:11.689 --> 20:13.964
No. I'm just a girl.

20:15.729 --> 20:18.197
Now, let me ask you a question.

20:20.609 --> 20:26.002
This thing that you did, translating
this ancient code or whatever...

20:26.569 --> 20:28.799
...why did you do it?
- I did it for my father.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.963
- To finish his work?
- People hurt him.

20:32.129 --> 20:34.962
And I wanted to find out who,
and I wanna get even.

20:35.129 --> 20:38.041
- Even at the risk of them hurting you?
- He's my dad.

20:38.209 --> 20:41.645
I love him. And if I can't
have him back, I want justice.

20:44.129 --> 20:46.962
- I envy you.
- You're not close to your folks?

20:48.849 --> 20:50.999
My mom is dead.

20:51.409 --> 20:54.606
- I'm sorry.
- And my dad is...

20:54.769 --> 20:56.202
...gone.

20:57.049 --> 20:59.119
You don't know where he is?

20:59.409 --> 21:01.365
I'm not really that interested.

21:01.609 --> 21:04.248
- I don't understand that.
- You don't know my dad.

21:04.929 --> 21:06.362
Do you?

21:09.689 --> 21:12.999
No, I never got the chance to,
unfortunately.

21:14.809 --> 21:18.404
Okay. I'm a sucker for family.
Follow me.

21:19.969 --> 21:22.244
- Jack's not a warlock.
- He's a jerk.

21:22.409 --> 21:24.969
We're going to the hospital.
We gotta get Eric's dad out of there

21:25.129 --> 21:27.848
and keep him someplace safe.
Come on.

21:59.329 --> 22:01.559
Where is everybody?

22:02.729 --> 22:05.004
- Did you bring that dagger?
- Yep.

22:13.489 --> 22:16.686
- Dad!
- Eric, wait!

22:19.529 --> 22:21.918
Dad, we gotta get you out of here.

22:22.089 --> 22:24.557
- Eric.
- I'm getting him out of here, Phoebe.

22:32.649 --> 22:34.207
- What's going on?
- Later.

22:34.369 --> 22:36.803
Get him. We gotta get out of here.

22:36.969 --> 22:38.800
Where did they go?

22:39.569 --> 22:41.241
Looking for that?

22:41.409 --> 22:43.400
He's got the dagger.

22:44.089 --> 22:45.727
Piper!

22:49.209 --> 22:51.518
Move, and she dies.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.321
Dad?

23:16.049 --> 23:20.839
Eric. Eric, we still wanna help you.
Nothing has changed.

23:21.009 --> 23:25.958
No, everything has changed. Some
kind of monsters just took my dad.

23:26.129 --> 23:28.882
- They're called warlocks.
- Warlocks?

23:30.369 --> 23:32.803
What does that make
the three of you?

23:33.049 --> 23:34.164
Witches.

23:35.809 --> 23:38.642
Forgive me, but what
you're saying is insane.

23:39.689 --> 23:41.281
Eric, you believe in
the Akashic Records

23:41.449 --> 23:43.644
and all the power
that they represent, right?

23:43.809 --> 23:46.482
- Yeah, I guess.
- Well, most people think that's a myth.

23:46.809 --> 23:48.242
But you now know that it isn't.

23:48.409 --> 23:52.846
So isn't it possible that other things like
witches and warlocks actually do exist?

23:53.009 --> 23:55.967
Maybe, but why would warlocks
want my dad?

23:56.129 --> 23:59.121
They're probably gonna offer you a
trade: Your dad for what's in your head.

23:59.289 --> 24:01.723
And they can appear
any time, anyplace.

24:01.889 --> 24:03.800
Which is why we need to get you
back to the manor.

24:03.969 --> 24:06.403
You'll be safer there
than anywhere else.

24:06.569 --> 24:08.241
Okay, look, Eric, I am the same girl

24:08.409 --> 24:10.047
you met at the hospital
a few weeks ago.

24:10.209 --> 24:12.882
The only thing that's changed is,
now you know our secret.

24:13.209 --> 24:16.360
- It's one hell of a secret.
- Yeah, and I trust you with it.

24:16.929 --> 24:19.079
So please trust me in return.

24:19.769 --> 24:22.841
Look, if we're gonna save your father,
we have to keep you safe

24:23.009 --> 24:24.567
until we figure out
what we're gonna do.

24:24.729 --> 24:27.721
You do that. I have another idea.

24:27.889 --> 24:30.961
Okay, I'm gonna go get him,
you two get home.

24:31.569 --> 24:34.481
- Do we have to protect him?
- He is pissing me off.

24:36.929 --> 24:40.444
- Eric, what are you doing?
- You'll see.

24:41.929 --> 24:44.568
We shouldn't be out in the open
like this. It's not safe.

24:44.729 --> 24:46.720
Then go. I have
something I have to do.

24:46.889 --> 24:48.242
What? What do you have to do?

24:48.609 --> 24:50.918
Get busted, Eric? That...

24:55.129 --> 24:56.448
That's the map stone, isn't it?

24:56.609 --> 24:59.282
Yeah. My father thought it would be
so wonderful translating it.

24:59.449 --> 25:02.998
A gift of knowledge to usher the world
into the new millennium.

25:03.729 --> 25:04.718
What are you doing?

25:04.929 --> 25:08.717
If the Akashic Records are everything
you say they are, they're not a gift.

25:08.889 --> 25:11.164
I mean, the warlocks shouldn't have
that knowledge.

25:11.329 --> 25:13.081
Neither should the rest of us.

25:13.249 --> 25:15.809
With all knowledge revealed,
we could have no free will.

25:15.969 --> 25:18.642
And no world as we know it.

25:19.129 --> 25:21.040
Maybe no world at all.

25:22.329 --> 25:23.921
Oh, my God!

25:31.329 --> 25:34.002
Now no one else will ever
be able to translate the map.

25:34.169 --> 25:37.161
The only place the longitude exists
is in my head.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.081
I'll get security.

25:41.689 --> 25:44.726
- Poor Eric.
- He'll be okay. We'll figure this out.

25:44.889 --> 25:46.720
Yeah. In the meantime,
warlocks have his father.

25:46.889 --> 25:49.244
I can't imagine
how helpless he must feel.

25:49.409 --> 25:51.001
I can.

25:51.849 --> 25:55.603
Prue, a warlock
didn't take our father.

25:55.769 --> 25:57.964
No, he left on his own.

25:58.129 --> 26:01.804
- Do you miss him?
- I didn't say that.

26:02.609 --> 26:05.282
- Do you think about him?
- Why?

26:05.449 --> 26:08.521
Because I'm wondering
if I'm the only one who does.

26:08.889 --> 26:12.040
- No, you're not.
- So you miss him.

26:13.689 --> 26:16.157
I miss who he should have been,
and I miss who he never was,

26:16.329 --> 26:18.365
but I don't miss him.

26:20.809 --> 26:22.447
I do.

26:22.609 --> 26:25.203
All right, can we get to work?

26:25.689 --> 26:28.681
Okay, let's save
someone else's father instead.

26:28.889 --> 26:30.800
All right, the only way to protect Eric

26:30.969 --> 26:32.960
is to take the information
out of his brain forever.

26:33.129 --> 26:34.642
The spell is right here.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.961
But if we do that, Eric won't
have anything to offer the warlocks,

26:38.129 --> 26:40.802
and they'll be furious.
And they'll kill his dad.

26:40.969 --> 26:43.927
Well, Eric is our innocent.
Our priority is him.

26:44.089 --> 26:45.602
Yeah, but they're both innocents.

26:45.769 --> 26:48.966
Piper, I hope it doesn't come to this,
but we may have to make a choice.

26:49.129 --> 26:52.519
Why? I mean, there's gotta be another
way, with all the hocus-pocus we have.

26:52.689 --> 26:54.964
Still may not be enough.
I mean, we're talking about

26:55.129 --> 26:57.848
the future, everyone's future.

26:58.009 --> 27:00.125
So we have to sacrifice Eric's dad?

27:01.009 --> 27:02.601
For the greater good.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.008
Man, you can dress it up
any way you want, it still stinks.

27:06.169 --> 27:07.648
You know what, it sucks.

27:10.489 --> 27:12.605
Oh, that's Dan.
I gotta go deal with him.

27:12.769 --> 27:16.000
You gotta figure out
what we're gonna say to Phoebe.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.877
Hey. You ready to go?

27:26.049 --> 27:28.279
Oh, man. She's not coming.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.361
Dan...

27:32.289 --> 27:35.918
Look, I wanna go, I really do.
I'm just not quite ready yet.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.922
Piper. Any word from the...

27:39.089 --> 27:42.923
...pizza guy? Hi, Dan. We ordered
pizza. Would you like to stay for pizza?

27:43.089 --> 27:46.684
No, I wanna go. With her.
But what's the point?

27:46.849 --> 27:48.441
Okay, okay,
I know what you're thinking...

27:48.769 --> 27:50.407
Piper!

27:50.689 --> 27:53.408
- But I can be ready on time.
- Okay.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.163
Well, I have to leave in an hour,

27:55.329 --> 27:57.206
I'm gonna be late
for this wedding rehearsal.

27:57.369 --> 27:59.519
So car's gonna leave at 6.
I hope to see you in it.

27:59.689 --> 28:01.247
Okay.

28:02.409 --> 28:03.842
Someday, some way, somehow,

28:04.009 --> 28:06.523
I'm gonna make it
through that damn door.

28:07.569 --> 28:09.048
Have the warlocks
made contact yet?

28:10.329 --> 28:12.797
No, not yet.
Where have you guys been?

28:12.969 --> 28:15.244
Well, Eric destroyed the map stone,
so we're covered there.

28:15.409 --> 28:17.365
Did you guys find
anything in the Book?

28:18.849 --> 28:21.317
You tell her. I've broken
enough hearts this afternoon.

28:21.489 --> 28:22.524
We'll both tell her.

28:22.889 --> 28:25.449
Eric, why don't you go check
your messages at home.

28:25.609 --> 28:28.840
- Maybe they tried to contact you there.
- Okay.

28:30.129 --> 28:31.926
What's going on?

28:33.129 --> 28:34.482
Can we talk?

28:41.369 --> 28:43.883
You have no new messages.

28:44.649 --> 28:47.004
Wait, you're willing
to let Eric's father die?

28:47.169 --> 28:50.445
We can't risk losing Eric and allow
the warlocks to gain future knowledge.

28:50.929 --> 28:53.966
But not at the expense of his father.
We have to save him.

28:54.129 --> 28:55.801
Phoebe, we have to save
everyone's dad.

28:55.969 --> 28:58.119
We have to protect the whole world
from these warlocks.

28:58.289 --> 29:00.086
And we can't do it
if they have the Records.

29:00.249 --> 29:01.807
So, what am I supposed to tell Eric,

29:01.969 --> 29:03.687
that we might have to
sacrifice his father?

29:03.849 --> 29:07.478
I can't do that. I promised him
that we would save him.

29:10.009 --> 29:13.126
- Phoebe.
- You don't even care.

29:14.689 --> 29:15.917
I'm sorry.

29:16.089 --> 29:18.398
I didn't mean that. I don't know
why I even thought it.

29:18.569 --> 29:22.528
- Do you want us to tell him?
- No, it's something that I have to do.

29:27.049 --> 29:30.041
- Hello?
- Eric. I assume you know who this is.

29:30.209 --> 29:33.281
- Where's my father?
- Oh, you do know. Good.

29:33.449 --> 29:35.883
Say hello to Eric, Ben.

29:37.769 --> 29:41.159
- Eric? Son?
- Dad?

29:41.329 --> 29:42.478
I feel so odd.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.279
Dad! Dad!

29:49.129 --> 29:52.439
Oh, he's gone, Eric. But I can
bring him back and give him to you.

29:53.329 --> 29:55.797
All I want in exchange is
what's in your head.

29:56.569 --> 29:58.924
- Where can I find you?
- The oak grove, the west end

29:59.089 --> 30:03.321
of Golden Gate Park. Half an hour.
Alone. Without the witches.

30:03.529 --> 30:04.882
Eric?

30:06.849 --> 30:09.409
- Any messages?
- No, not yet.

30:09.569 --> 30:10.763
Eric...

30:10.929 --> 30:14.638
Before you say another word,
I just wanna say thank you

30:14.809 --> 30:16.959
for everything you've done
for my father.

30:18.009 --> 30:19.601
I mean, everything you're trying to do.

30:19.769 --> 30:22.408
You sure you're not an angel?

30:22.569 --> 30:26.642
No, I'm no angel. I could probably
introduce you to one, though.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.400
It's a shame your father's
not a part of your life.

30:29.689 --> 30:32.567
He would be so proud of you.

30:34.809 --> 30:36.845
Eric, I need to talk to you...

30:37.609 --> 30:39.645
...about you and your dad.

30:39.809 --> 30:41.128
Okay.

30:42.569 --> 30:45.129
Maybe we should have
another cup of tea first.

30:45.289 --> 30:48.804
- Okay, I'll go get it.
- Thanks.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.727
Eric, where are you going?

30:58.769 --> 31:00.202
I'm just gonna go out, get some air.

31:00.369 --> 31:02.405
The oak grove, Golden Gate Park.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.968
Phoebe!

31:04.569 --> 31:06.366
Yeah?

31:06.529 --> 31:09.726
- Where is he going?
- He was thinking Golden Gate Park.

31:09.889 --> 31:12.449
Oh, my God, the warlocks
must have contacted him.

31:33.289 --> 31:35.849
All right, there are
oak trees everywhere.

31:36.009 --> 31:38.648
- What if we're too late?
- Phoebe, stop thinking that.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.606
Would you get
out of my head, please?

31:40.769 --> 31:42.999
The Book of Shadows
said that their hunger is our ally.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.160
So there must be a way
to use the knowledge

31:45.329 --> 31:46.887
that they've acquired against them.

31:47.049 --> 31:48.721
Or use their greed to trap them.

31:48.889 --> 31:50.766
Yeah, well, if all else fails,

31:50.929 --> 31:53.762
then we'll freeze them and move them
long enough to get Eric away.

31:53.929 --> 31:56.284
And save his father, right?

31:57.609 --> 32:00.169
Look, it just seems to me we should do
everything we possibly can

32:00.329 --> 32:02.320
to reunite Eric and his father.

32:02.489 --> 32:05.640
I mean, imagine, a dad who actually
wants to be with his child.

32:05.809 --> 32:07.162
Pheebs, we'll do our best.

32:07.689 --> 32:12.046
Okay. Then we should split up.
The first one that sees him hollers.

33:05.409 --> 33:07.445
- Dad!
- That's close enough, Eric.

33:10.569 --> 33:13.083
I can restore him,
or I can kill him, Eric.

33:14.209 --> 33:15.403
That choice is mine.

33:15.569 --> 33:18.879
Restore him, or you don't get
what you want. That choice is mine.

33:19.049 --> 33:22.962
No, no, no, no, no, you can't bargain,
Eric. We're in control here.

33:25.329 --> 33:27.126
Let's check again.

33:28.609 --> 33:29.928
Who's got the upper hand?

33:30.089 --> 33:33.525
Haven't you been paying attention?
That gun won't do anything to us.

33:33.689 --> 33:35.884
No, but it will blow my head off.

33:36.049 --> 33:38.802
And if I do that, you don't get
the second half of the map.

33:40.889 --> 33:43.357
Restore him. Now.

34:01.489 --> 34:03.127
- Dad?
- Eric.

34:04.289 --> 34:06.120
Son, what are you doing?

34:06.289 --> 34:07.688
Dad!

34:09.768 --> 34:13.920
You're mine now, Eric!
Like I said, we're in control.

34:33.409 --> 34:34.762
Phoebe.

34:36.929 --> 34:38.726
Prue, watch out!

34:41.849 --> 34:44.079
That's right, witches.
Come and get me.

34:45.649 --> 34:47.844
Don't blink.
Keep them focused on me.

34:48.009 --> 34:49.806
Let him surprise them from behind.

34:49.969 --> 34:52.164
- Wait, don't freeze him.
- Why not?

34:52.329 --> 34:54.239
Didn't you hear his thoughts?
He's playing decoy.

34:54.409 --> 34:56.081
Let him think that it's working.

35:17.889 --> 35:20.357
You know, they really shouldn't have
given us the finger.

35:20.529 --> 35:21.882
You read my mind.

35:26.489 --> 35:28.639
Prue? Piper?

35:29.569 --> 35:31.002
Are you okay?

35:31.169 --> 35:33.967
I think so.
What are we doing in the park?

35:37.969 --> 35:39.846
Who are those people?

35:41.609 --> 35:45.648
- You don't recognize Eric?
- No. Why, should I? Should I?

35:45.809 --> 35:48.403
What's the last thing you remember?

35:49.409 --> 35:52.765
- The Halloween party.
- That was three weeks ago.

35:56.529 --> 36:00.681
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

36:00.849 --> 36:02.680
Just a little confused.
What am I doing here?

36:02.849 --> 36:04.919
You don't recognize her?

36:05.089 --> 36:06.761
No.

36:06.929 --> 36:08.681
Wait, I think I've seen you
at the hospital.

36:09.129 --> 36:10.960
Who's the cute guy?

36:17.809 --> 36:19.401
- Dad?
- Eric.

36:19.569 --> 36:21.321
Oh, my God! You're...

36:21.489 --> 36:22.808
You're better!

36:23.729 --> 36:27.165
- What's going on? What's happening?
- I don't know.

36:27.329 --> 36:30.560
- Did we do something good?
- You did something incredible.

36:41.729 --> 36:44.038
Okay, what am I thinking?

36:44.209 --> 36:45.722
That Dan's gonna leave without me.

36:45.889 --> 36:48.005
- Nope. Good, the spell is reversed.
- What a relief.

36:48.169 --> 36:50.399
I think we've proven beyond
a shadow of a doubt that man

36:50.569 --> 36:53.129
and, especially, woman aren't meant
to hear each other's thoughts.

36:53.289 --> 36:54.483
Definitely. Too much knowledge,

36:54.649 --> 36:56.844
whether it comes from the
Akashic Records or people's heads,

36:57.009 --> 36:59.159
- is just dangerous stuff.
- So, what were you thinking?

36:59.329 --> 37:02.082
I was thinking what it shame it was
that Phoebe finally met a nice guy,

37:02.249 --> 37:04.399
and she's not even
gonna remember it.

37:05.529 --> 37:06.518
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:06.689 --> 37:08.486
- Hi.
- They're gorgeous.

37:08.649 --> 37:11.527
They're for you. The florist left them
on the porch. But there's no card.

37:11.689 --> 37:13.725
- They're huge.
- They're expensive.

37:14.329 --> 37:15.921
They're ringing.

37:17.889 --> 37:19.481
- Hello?
- Oh, no!

37:19.649 --> 37:22.402
Dan! He's leaving. Without me.

37:22.569 --> 37:25.447
- Don't just stand there, freeze him.
- Oh, right.

37:28.929 --> 37:30.647
I gotta go.

37:31.729 --> 37:33.208
It's such a nifty little power.

37:34.289 --> 37:37.087
Honey... Open.

37:38.529 --> 37:40.485
- Hello?
- At last.

37:40.649 --> 37:42.879
I've been calling you every
20 minutes for the last hour.

37:43.489 --> 37:45.844
- Did you like the flowers?
- Jack, what do you want?

37:46.369 --> 37:48.519
You know, you are
a very suspicious woman.

37:48.929 --> 37:50.885
No, I just like to think of it as careful.

37:51.289 --> 37:54.838
Oh, come on, Prue, are you saying
you've been totally honest with me?

37:56.409 --> 37:59.446
Jack, I can't hear you,
the phone's breaking up!

38:01.049 --> 38:05.167
I just... I wanted to apologize.
Can l...? Can I take you for dinner?

38:05.329 --> 38:08.719
- I don't think so.
- Come on. Let me buy you a drink.

38:09.209 --> 38:11.643
- I don't think so.
- Can I at least get my phone back?

38:12.809 --> 38:14.208
I don't think so.

38:22.089 --> 38:24.284
- Oh, I like it.
- What are you doing?

38:24.449 --> 38:26.644
I'm calling Tokyo.

38:29.569 --> 38:31.241
Konnichiwa.

38:41.729 --> 38:43.082
Excuse me.

38:43.249 --> 38:46.127
I'm looking for a Dr Schlenzig. I need
him to sign some insurance papers.

38:46.289 --> 38:47.881
I was told he'd be in here.

38:48.049 --> 38:50.927
Yeah, he actually just took
Mrs Bruen to the sunroom.

38:51.089 --> 38:54.365
- You could probably catch him there.
- Great. Thanks.

38:57.809 --> 38:59.401
You're Phoebe, right?

38:59.569 --> 39:01.958
I'm Eric Bragg. I think I saw you
the other day at the park.

39:02.489 --> 39:04.559
Right. Right, how's your father?

39:04.729 --> 39:07.721
Oh, he's better, thanks.
He's almost back to his old self.

39:08.729 --> 39:10.367
I remember...

39:10.529 --> 39:13.282
...you were really sweet to him
when he was in here.

39:13.449 --> 39:15.599
Not many people
would have bothered.

39:15.769 --> 39:18.727
- You must be an angel.
- No, I'm no angel.

39:18.889 --> 39:21.961
But I could probably introduce you
to one if you'd like.

39:33.289 --> 39:36.440
You know, I just realized, I have
no idea where the sunroom is.

39:37.369 --> 39:40.839
It's kind of complicated.
Maybe I should draw you a map.
