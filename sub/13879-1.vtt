00:35.137 --> 00:36.862
No, no, no. Sand it
more in the front, and

00:36.877 --> 00:38.343
you'll eliminate a lot of drag.

00:38.345 --> 00:41.180
See, it's all about increasing
your velocity coefficient.

00:41.182 --> 00:42.548
You like physics?

00:42.550 --> 00:44.650
Sure you do, because
numbers are cool.

00:44.652 --> 00:46.885
The only number I care
about is number one.

00:46.887 --> 00:48.687
Well, winning's not everything.

00:48.689 --> 00:52.257
It's every only thing ever...
Vince Lombardi.

00:52.259 --> 00:53.225
The hell you doing?

00:53.227 --> 00:54.359
Oh, hey, Carl.

00:54.361 --> 00:55.827
We're making a
soapbox derby car.

00:55.829 --> 00:57.362
This is my new best bud, Gerald.

00:57.364 --> 00:58.697
- Say hey, Gerald.
- What's up?

00:58.699 --> 01:00.632
It looks, uh, a
little like 2 Wycked.

01:00.634 --> 01:01.600
Yeah, man.

01:01.602 --> 01:03.569
That's the inspiration.

01:03.571 --> 01:05.404
Well, 2 Wycked is copyrighted.

01:05.406 --> 01:07.105
Well, I mean, can we...

01:07.107 --> 01:08.207
No, you can't.

01:08.209 --> 01:09.575
It's a one-of-a-kind original.

01:09.577 --> 01:13.111
- I can't have you and...
Oh, what's-his-nuts...
- It's Gerald.

01:13.113 --> 01:15.814
Whatever his name is,
cheapening it with a knock-off.

01:15.816 --> 01:19.647
Carl, look, this is my little brother
in the Big Brother program, okay?

01:19.653 --> 01:22.821
I want to show him that not all
men in this world are abusive.

01:22.823 --> 01:26.491
I'm just saying that if you
continue ripping off my

01:26.493 --> 01:29.661
idea, my unique graphic,
someone's face is gonna get

01:29.663 --> 01:31.863
ripped off, and that
ain't a threat.

01:31.865 --> 01:33.465
That's the Carl guarantee.

01:33.467 --> 01:35.167
Carl, he's 9.

01:35.169 --> 01:38.870
When I was 9, I already had
hair on my buttocks, back,

01:38.872 --> 01:41.607
and underarms, like
an animal in the zoo.

01:41.609 --> 01:45.177
Life sucks, my friend,
'cause guess what.

01:45.179 --> 01:47.913
Boom... that just happened.

01:48.782 --> 01:50.716
Oh, Gerald, get your book bag.

01:50.718 --> 01:51.516
Your mom's here.

02:04.695 --> 02:06.801
Gerald, get over here!

02:06.888 --> 02:08.400
Did you plop him in
front of the TV?

02:08.401 --> 02:10.702
Gerald and I had a great time.
Didn't we, buddy?

02:10.704 --> 02:13.105
I swear to God, he bugs
the ass out of me.

02:13.107 --> 02:15.837
We's just teaching your boy about
intellectual property law.

02:15.843 --> 02:17.409
Don't pay attention to him.

02:17.411 --> 02:19.278
Hi, I'm Carl. I'm his
co-big brother here.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.779
Uh, you have to
excuse Carl here.

02:20.781 --> 02:22.381
He's not at all involved
in the program.

02:22.383 --> 02:24.316
But I am going to be.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.117
Yep. Uh-huh.

02:25.119 --> 02:26.318
I get it. I get it.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.119
You want to go.

02:27.121 --> 02:27.853
See you tomorrow.

02:27.855 --> 02:28.887
Yeah, we will.

02:28.889 --> 02:32.557
We'll see both of those tomorrow...
just a bouncin' around.

02:32.559 --> 02:35.456
You can sign up for the program at the
local community center, too, Carl.

02:35.462 --> 02:37.162
Plenty of kids out there.
Why don't you just...

02:37.164 --> 02:38.497
No, no, no.

02:38.499 --> 02:39.598
I want that one.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.399
Fine.

02:40.401 --> 02:41.767
Do you know anything
about soccer?

02:41.769 --> 02:42.501
What?

02:42.503 --> 02:43.468
Besides that it's gay?

02:43.470 --> 02:45.404
Yeah, besides that it's gay.

02:45.406 --> 02:47.739
It is also boring.

02:47.741 --> 02:50.208
There's that, too.

02:50.210 --> 02:53.378
Aw, come on, Gerald, get
your head out of your ass!

02:53.380 --> 02:55.747
This is what I think of
your hustle right now.

02:55.749 --> 02:56.648
Carl, please!

02:56.650 --> 02:58.550
Kick that ball, or I'm
gonna kick your ass.

02:58.552 --> 02:59.518
Chill out, man!

02:59.520 --> 03:01.053
I'm gonna go to the playground.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.854
Okay. Yeah, yeah. You're right.
You're right.

03:02.856 --> 03:04.589
I get a little heated here.

03:04.591 --> 03:05.390
Give me that chair.

03:05.392 --> 03:08.760
Yeah, yeah, good idea, man...
sit down, cool off.

03:08.762 --> 03:10.295
That's right, zebra!

03:10.297 --> 03:12.564
You got money on this
game or something, huh?!

03:13.600 --> 03:15.600
What is this, a
Valentine's card?

03:15.602 --> 03:17.102
I love you, too!

03:17.638 --> 03:18.870
Yeah!

03:18.872 --> 03:21.640
Look, I lost my cool.

03:21.642 --> 03:23.508
I went loco out there.

03:23.510 --> 03:26.578
Like, I definitely should not
have rammed that guy's S.U.V. in

03:26.580 --> 03:30.449
the parking lot afterwards, but
I did not like how his kid was

03:30.451 --> 03:32.351
on the other team mouthing off,

03:32.353 --> 03:34.886
like going "yay" when
they scored a goal.

03:34.888 --> 03:36.822
That's bulletin-board material.

03:36.824 --> 03:38.357
Okay, so, we bonded now?

03:38.359 --> 03:39.491
We good with that?

03:39.493 --> 03:40.592
Where's your mom?

03:40.594 --> 03:41.827
Here, Gerald.

03:41.829 --> 03:43.195
Go play the claw cage.

03:43.197 --> 03:45.564
I need to talk to your
other big brother here.

03:45.566 --> 03:47.566
What? This is going solid.

03:47.568 --> 03:50.202
Look, that kid has seen
a lot of trouble in his

03:50.204 --> 03:53.267
time, and if you think this is a game
just to get in his mom's pants...

03:53.273 --> 03:54.673
Oh, I'm sorry, Gandhi.

03:54.675 --> 03:55.741
Why are you doing it?

03:55.743 --> 03:56.875
For Gerald.

03:56.877 --> 03:58.176
He's had a tough road.

03:58.178 --> 04:00.312
Wow. Is that right?

04:00.314 --> 04:01.413
Okay, yeah.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.682
Yeah, yeah, I want to get
in his mom's pants, too.

04:03.684 --> 04:05.217
She is hot, and I
like her boobs.

04:05.219 --> 04:06.418
Yep! Yeah, there we go.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.787
But she just got out of an
abusive relationship, and

04:08.789 --> 04:10.555
she ain't in the mood
to start another one.

04:10.557 --> 04:12.524
Hey, the claw cage
took my money.

04:12.526 --> 04:14.159
It did what to my son?

04:14.161 --> 04:15.293
Where?

04:16.230 --> 04:19.630
Clamp... down on that...
fuzzy guppy, you bitch!

04:19.632 --> 04:21.099
Oh, hey, guy. What's up?

04:21.101 --> 04:22.434
Oh, hey, Darlene.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.503
Did you have a good
mother's morning out?

04:24.505 --> 04:26.705
Who's that shirtless guy
over there with Gerald?

04:26.707 --> 04:28.573
That's just some knucklehead.

04:28.575 --> 04:31.777
Ooh, looks like you
got a mani-pedi.

04:31.779 --> 04:33.512
Look how strong he is.

04:33.514 --> 04:36.581
How 'bout we cut out
the middle man?

04:36.583 --> 04:37.282
Yeah!

04:37.284 --> 04:40.819
I like a man who uses force
to get what he wants.

04:40.821 --> 04:41.586
Friend of yours?

04:41.588 --> 04:43.455
Mm-hmm, that's Carl.
He my best friend.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.157
What the hell are
you doing here?

04:45.159 --> 04:47.659
You never take me out for
no all-you-can-eat pizza.

04:47.661 --> 04:52.597
Yeah, I got free Teddy bears to
go around <i>and</i> the MP3 player.

04:52.599 --> 04:54.566
They didn't think I
could get that, huh?

04:56.203 --> 04:59.471
And I could do that same trick
to the condom machine in the

04:59.473 --> 05:03.308
service station down the street...
If that's what you want.

05:03.310 --> 05:07.675
Okay, we got all his stuffed toys
and his sleeping bag and whatnot.

05:07.681 --> 05:13.414
Eddie money ought to be done by
midnight, so we'll see you after that.

05:13.420 --> 05:16.822
Unless...
Dot-dot-dot-deet-dot!

05:18.692 --> 05:20.792
Tonight!

05:20.794 --> 05:24.563
- Do you, uh, want to play checkers?
- Good night.

05:24.565 --> 05:26.097
You got more, bitch?

05:27.100 --> 05:28.333
You got more?
You got more?!

05:28.335 --> 05:30.202
- Stop that.
- I wasn't doing anything.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.770
Get that damn finger
out your nose.

05:31.772 --> 05:33.371
- I wasn't.
- Oh, yeah.

05:33.373 --> 05:34.172
Oh, yeah.

05:34.174 --> 05:35.707
- Don't eat it!
- I'm not.

05:35.709 --> 05:36.608
Make me a woman!

05:36.610 --> 05:38.477
Make me a woman!

05:40.814 --> 05:41.713
Carl!

05:41.715 --> 05:43.482
Hey, Fryman, what's up?

05:43.484 --> 05:45.183
You got any more pinot gris?

05:45.185 --> 05:46.318
Where's the other box?

05:46.320 --> 05:47.118
Hey, mom.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.688
You left for the Eddie money
concert four days ago!

05:49.690 --> 05:51.122
Well, we never made it.

05:51.124 --> 05:54.860
We got too busy, uh, doing a little
rock show of our own in here.

05:54.862 --> 05:56.828
Know what I mean?

05:56.830 --> 05:59.331
Your mom plays a pretty
mean skin flute.

06:00.767 --> 06:01.399
Oh, yeah!

06:01.401 --> 06:03.802
Were you ever gonna stop
by and pick up Gerald?

06:03.804 --> 06:09.670
At this age, he don't need to be exposed
to all this alcohol and nonstop banging.

06:09.676 --> 06:11.543
It ain't a positive
environment for him.

06:11.545 --> 06:14.542
You left him with one pair of
underwear and a gummy worm.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.148
Listen, when you tell a kid
he ain't never gonna amount

06:17.150 --> 06:19.217
to nothing, you got to give
him a gummy worm first.

06:19.219 --> 06:20.151
It softens the blow.

06:20.153 --> 06:21.820
I wasn't gonna tell him that!

06:21.822 --> 06:24.289
Well, someone has to,
'cause I'm bored with it.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.324
Wait, Carl! Carl!

06:26.326 --> 06:28.393
Boom! Feel the heat!

06:28.395 --> 06:31.763
I will slide down this
ladder all day on your ass!

06:31.765 --> 06:33.832
I don't want to play anymore.

06:33.834 --> 06:35.367
Okay, all right, look.

06:35.369 --> 06:37.202
I'm sorry, but you
suck at this game.

06:37.204 --> 06:41.502
When you tangle with the ladder master, you
slide down the chute and you get shot, son!

06:41.508 --> 06:42.574
Gerald, get over here.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.276
Well, about damn time.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.176
We've got to go.

06:45.178 --> 06:47.445
I've got some exciting news!

06:47.447 --> 06:51.316
- You're gonna have a little brother!
- What?

06:51.318 --> 06:54.452
Yeah, the, uh...
the trap has two lines on it.

06:54.454 --> 06:55.554
The strip, I mean.

06:55.556 --> 06:57.188
We're gonna be a family!

06:57.190 --> 06:59.391
And congratulations on that.

06:59.393 --> 07:02.627
So, you just give me a call
sometime, okay, toots, when you,

07:02.629 --> 07:04.529
you know, reopen for business.

07:04.531 --> 07:05.530
No, silly.

07:05.532 --> 07:08.400
I'll be back later tonight
with all my things.

07:08.402 --> 07:10.435
- Where your keys, honey bunny?
- What do you mean?

07:10.437 --> 07:13.271
- You're taking the bus, right?
- Um... I guess so.

07:13.273 --> 07:14.573
Yeah, you guess right.

07:14.575 --> 07:15.640
I'm just so excited.

07:15.642 --> 07:16.841
Come on, Gerald!

07:16.843 --> 07:17.676
I'm coming!

07:17.678 --> 07:19.077
Yeah, no, thank you.

07:19.079 --> 07:19.644
No, thank you.

07:19.646 --> 07:21.546
Buh-bye. Buh-bye.

07:21.548 --> 07:24.149
You know, Carl, I'm still
a little pissed off,

07:24.151 --> 07:26.651
but... I know when
I've been beat.

07:26.653 --> 07:27.519
Congratulations.

07:27.521 --> 07:28.587
Just kill me.

07:28.589 --> 07:30.655
- Kill me now.
- Ah, come on, Carl.

07:30.657 --> 07:32.757
- You're gonna be a daddy!
- You're a science guy.

07:32.759 --> 07:36.094
You got to have some sort of
laser beam that like, uh...

07:36.096 --> 07:38.296
What? Abortion ray?

07:38.298 --> 07:40.532
That's so weird how you
could read my mind.

07:40.534 --> 07:41.700
Yeah, he doesn't.

07:41.702 --> 07:43.134
I ask him all the time.

07:43.136 --> 07:44.436
You can't abort me.

07:44.438 --> 07:46.304
- I exist.
- You're not a child.

07:46.306 --> 07:47.172
You're a choice.

07:47.174 --> 07:48.206
What am I gonna do?

07:48.208 --> 07:49.474
Follow me.

07:49.476 --> 07:52.444
I'm quite good at
fixing situations.

07:53.243 --> 07:55.010
<i>Hey, you've reached
Carl's voicemail.</i>

07:55.012 --> 07:56.878
<i>Unfortunately, he's
not able to get it.</i>

07:56.880 --> 08:00.511
<i>He's just left the country on some very
important international business.</i>

08:00.666 --> 08:03.167
<i>Boy, I hope that plane doesn't
crash... looked like it might.</i>

08:03.801 --> 08:05.233
<i>Hey, anyway, leave a message.</i>

08:05.235 --> 08:07.433
<i>I will try and get it to
him, but probably delete</i>

08:07.459 --> 08:09.367
<i>it if it's something
we don't want to hear.</i>

08:09.373 --> 08:10.939
<i>You really think this will w...</i>

08:10.941 --> 08:12.074
You really think this will work?

08:12.138 --> 08:13.471
We don't guarantee our service.

08:13.476 --> 08:14.975
That's why I requested
a check in advance.

08:14.977 --> 08:17.711
- Carl, you got to own up to this.
- Own up to what?

08:17.713 --> 08:19.647
It is obvious to you and me and

08:19.649 --> 08:22.549
the nose on my face that
she is a gold digger.

08:22.551 --> 08:24.652
She wants my vinyl-sided house.

08:24.654 --> 08:26.754
She wants my above-ground pool.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.657
She wants my 21-inch
plasma screen.

08:29.659 --> 08:31.091
She don't love me for who I am!

08:31.093 --> 08:32.726
You have one option.

08:32.727 --> 08:33.660
Fake your death.

08:33.663 --> 08:36.130
Well, our service guarantees
actual death.

08:36.832 --> 08:38.499
That's just a water gun.

08:38.501 --> 08:41.034
No, it's not.

08:41.037 --> 08:44.939
See? I told you.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.641
This is crystallized
black-widow venom.

08:47.643 --> 08:49.109
You will inhale it, and it will

08:49.111 --> 08:51.845
put your body in a catatonic
state for up to 10 days.

08:51.847 --> 08:53.981
We'll tell her you're dead...
She moves on.

08:53.983 --> 08:56.483
Then you just need to hide out
for the rest of your life.

08:56.485 --> 08:58.686
All right, let's
light this candle.

09:04.676 --> 09:10.819
First, we are here today,
to go that all-you-can-eat

09:10.835 --> 09:13.858
pizza place that I'm crazy about
that got the busted claw cage
with the stuffed toys.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.711
Shh, have some respect.
Meatwad!

09:15.802 --> 09:17.101
Hold on a second. Hold on.

09:17.103 --> 09:18.302
After the funeral.

09:18.345 --> 09:19.511
Is that what this is?

09:19.513 --> 09:20.979
Yes, that's what this is!

09:20.981 --> 09:22.247
Hey, look at this, y'all.

09:22.249 --> 09:25.284
I do the lever this way,
the coffin rises back up.

09:25.286 --> 09:26.552
And now look at this.

09:26.554 --> 09:27.786
Stop that!

09:27.787 --> 09:29.053
It's so disrespectful!

09:29.055 --> 09:29.854
Let me try it!

09:29.856 --> 09:32.423
Look, I know you're in a
lot of pain right now,

09:32.425 --> 09:33.925
Darlene, and I think I can help

09:33.927 --> 09:36.928
you through this as a friend...
or maybe more.

09:36.930 --> 09:40.898
No offense, Fryman, but I
need a <i>real</i> man in my life.

09:40.900 --> 09:44.135
You never were strong or
assertive, like my Carl.

09:44.137 --> 09:45.403
Oh, a real man, huh?

09:45.405 --> 09:46.471
I'll show you a real man!

09:46.473 --> 09:48.172
Carl, you fat bastard!

09:48.174 --> 09:51.409
Damn yo' ass for dying on us!

09:51.411 --> 09:55.346
You ain't going to heaven, not if
I have anything to say about it!

09:55.348 --> 09:58.149
I've never seen Frylock
in this light.

09:58.151 --> 09:59.817
He reminds me of dad.

10:05.079 --> 10:08.790
I told you, popcorn-potpourri
looks like buff.

10:09.286 --> 10:11.891
I like it, especially the
hat that it come in.

10:11.951 --> 10:13.584
Get the meatball out of here!

10:13.586 --> 10:15.719
Okay, I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.

10:15.721 --> 10:18.488
Dang, she sure made herself
at home in my room.

10:18.490 --> 10:20.524
Listen, all's fair in
love and war, Meatwad.

10:20.526 --> 10:21.391
But, uh...

10:21.393 --> 10:23.890
And that's why you're moving in
the living room with Shake.

10:23.896 --> 10:25.829
Your kingdom doth lie west.

10:25.831 --> 10:27.664
The east is mine!

10:27.666 --> 10:32.703
Through this duct-tape
sea, thou shall not pass!

10:32.705 --> 10:33.971
Is Carl really dead?

10:33.973 --> 10:36.840
Let's just say he
went underground.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.333
She's gone.

10:42.335 --> 10:43.267
Awesome.

10:44.738 --> 10:46.771
Wait a minute.
