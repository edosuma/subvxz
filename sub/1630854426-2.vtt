00:07.760 --> 00:11.000
If you had to choose three words
to express your grief,

00:11.080 --> 00:12.280
what would they be?

00:12.960 --> 00:14.120
Confusion…

00:14.840 --> 00:15.920
Anger…

00:16.720 --> 00:19.200
Disbelief-- not disbelief.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.960
Astonishment.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.120
So, anger, confusion…

00:28.200 --> 00:29.200
Fury.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.360
Fury.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.600
Turmoil. Stupefaction.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.840
Trauma. Anger.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.760
And total fucking astonishment.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.720
And, Amandine?

00:45.320 --> 00:47.720
I don't have three words
because there is none.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.040
There are no words.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.240
Exactly.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.960
There's-- there's no words.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.160
Absolutely none.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.760
"I want to cum on your face."

01:02.840 --> 01:05.560
"2". Like the number two.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.000
Like he's in such a hurry.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.560
So that's Paul. What about this other guy?

01:10.640 --> 01:11.640
Dave.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.120
What kind of stupid name is that?

01:13.200 --> 01:17.160
Dave Burrow. He's the Head of Accounts
for an events company.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.280
As part of his rehab
after a skiing accident,

01:19.400 --> 01:23.320
Dave enrolled in "Caramelo's All Star
Salsa Fridays in Tufnell Park”.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.280
- That's where they met.
- I remember that.

01:25.360 --> 01:28.200
I remember Amandine told Lue
she'd taken up Salsa.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.040
Dave's engaged to Wendy

01:30.120 --> 01:32.640
which means Dave is keen to enter
a Gentleman's Agreement.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.000
Namely, I won't tell Wendy
that he's been fucking my wife

01:36.080 --> 01:38.960
and he in turn will stop
fucking said wife.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.320
And then, leave London, get a new job,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.520
where him and Wendy will be free
to live happily ever after.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.120
- So that's Dave.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.480
What about this Paul clown?

01:49.560 --> 01:50.960
No idea.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.680
You've no idea who he is?

01:52.760 --> 01:53.800
None.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.640
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna confront Amandine?

01:57.480 --> 01:58.520
Not yet.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.280
Not until I know everything.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.560
I've got to know more, and then
I'm gonna do something, I tell ya.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.880
Honestly, Jeff…

02:06.800 --> 02:08.720
I dunno what I'm gonna do but I'm gonna…

02:11.800 --> 02:13.800
I can't…

02:13.880 --> 02:16.440
I can't see the bottom on this.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.520
I can't see the sides.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.800
- I'm a bit fucking all over the…
- It's all right mate, come on.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.040
Fucking hell.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.880
- All right, mate.
- It's just for a few days, you know?

02:29.960 --> 02:31.880
I just feel like I need
someone to talk to.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.400
- Listen, mate, I can clear everything.
- Thank you.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.840
All right?
I can stay as long as you need.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.000
There's something else I need you to do.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.120
What's that?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.440
That's her phone.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.040
- What?
- Find him.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.040
I need you to find Paul.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.400
Like there's, there's things in there
that I can't access.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.840
Folders that I can't open.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.400
- No, Jamie…
- All right, I need you to crack it.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.920
- Jamie…
- You can. I can't, all right?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.440
Jeff. Please.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.760
My wife has been fucking not one,
but two other people.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.320
- Jamie…
- Her password is "LORCA69”.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.160
- Jame!
- All caps, all right?

03:03.240 --> 03:05.200
I need your help here Jeff, okay?

03:05.280 --> 03:06.880
I feel like I'm fucking drowning, mate.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.680
- Hey, pumpkin!
- Hey, Dad! Hi, Uncle Jeff!

03:09.760 --> 03:10.800
Hey, Greta,
did you have a good day at school?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.320
- Yes, thanks!
- Do you want to hop in?

03:13.440 --> 03:14.680
In you get.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.320
Uncle Jeff's gonna stay with us
for a couple of nights.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.520
Where's he gonna sleep?

03:20.600 --> 03:21.840
In the spare room.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.600
You mean the baby's room?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.840
Mrs Wilson!

03:32.080 --> 03:34.480
- Hey, Mr Lewis.
- You saw him, I take it?

03:36.920 --> 03:39.520
- Saw who?
- Stag. Up the woods.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.280
Shot in the lung and left for dead.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.480
Thought you may of.
Out with the dogs an' all.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.120
- I didn't see anything.
- Yeah.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.960
You see anybody strange about,
you give me a text.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.160
Will do.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.760
Best be off.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.240
Amandine said you are
going to grief therapy.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.000
There are seven stages.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.960
Denial. Guilt. Anger.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.440
Bargaining. Depression.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.240
Reconstruction. Acceptance.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.640
Transcendence.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.360
- That's eight.
- They've got leaflets.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.920
They haven't got one
to tell you what to do

04:34.040 --> 04:36.160
if you don't know
if it was your baby or…

04:43.120 --> 04:45.360
- "LORCA69".
- All caps.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.880
I was looking forward
to being a big sister.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.200
I know you were.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.600
We're still a family, aren't we?

05:12.760 --> 05:18.520
Hey, hey, of course we are, all right?

05:20.040 --> 05:22.800
Look at me. Of course we are.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.320
Of course we are.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.200
- Will Mum be all right?

06:18.440 --> 06:20.040
I can't find my phone.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.920
That's weird.
Have you looked down the side of the sofa?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.480
Ah, yeah, I've looked everywhere.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.040
It'll show up, I'm sure.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.400
I'm late. Bye!

06:28.480 --> 06:30.160
- See ya! Bye!
- Bye!

06:50.040 --> 06:51.080
Good morning.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.240
Check on!

06:57.320 --> 06:58.960
One Salmon, one beef,

06:59.040 --> 07:01.880
one ceviche, one lobster,
one mash, one chip.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.320
How long for this sea bass, Nelly?

07:03.400 --> 07:04.400
Two minutes, Chef!

07:04.480 --> 07:05.560
Garnish, Chris!

07:05.640 --> 07:07.040
Sleek.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.280
Bevelled.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.360
Shiny?

07:11.440 --> 07:12.520
Freedom.

07:14.680 --> 07:15.680
Cordless.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.400
Right,
I haven't got any fucking spoons!

07:17.480 --> 07:20.080
Where's the spoons?! I can't do it
if I haven't got a spoon, can I?!

07:20.160 --> 07:21.360
- This is, all right, Chef.
- All right, what am I gonna do?

07:21.440 --> 07:22.520
- There you go.
- Thank you! Jesus!

07:22.600 --> 07:25.040
Now, one word to describe it's appearance.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.000
It doesn't have to be literal,
it can be whatever comes to mind.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.440
What does it make you feel?

07:31.520 --> 07:33.400
- Quality?
- Balance.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.080
- Ease.
- Power.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.440
Is this seasoned, Nelly?

07:36.520 --> 07:37.920
- Yes, Chef!
- One hundred percent?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.280
- A hundred percent!
- Okay.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.800
If I've done breakfast for the kids,

07:40.880 --> 07:42.520
I could just go round after,

07:42.600 --> 07:44.320
with the crumbs,
and it would be simple I suppose.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.000
Just clean up after them.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.880
When you've been to the beach,
for sand.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.400
Or the dog basket.
For dog hair.

07:51.480 --> 07:52.520
Sucking…

07:53.440 --> 07:54.680
Handy.

07:54.760 --> 07:55.760
Plastic.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.920
Last year for his birthday,

08:11.000 --> 08:15.080
I bought Sotiris a tennis racquet
and it was exactly this colour.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.440
- Excuse me.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.960
You open in five days' time.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.040
This is your first solo restaurant.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.800
How are you feeling? You nervous?

08:36.920 --> 08:40.400
Er, honestly, absolutely crapping myself!

08:40.480 --> 08:43.640
I am, really.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.760
What would it mean to you
to get a Michelin star?

08:46.880 --> 08:49.160
Oh, look. I'm a cook.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.320
You know? I love to cook.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.840
I loved it before I ever knew
there was such a thing as stars and…

08:54.880 --> 08:56.360
it's a chance for me,

08:56.440 --> 08:59.280
an opportunity to take
everything I've learned

08:59.360 --> 09:02.880
up to this point
and-- and just say this is it, you know?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.760
This is-- this is who I am.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.640
This is me.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.040
So, Amandine.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.120
Where does the name come from?

09:14.200 --> 09:16.880
That's my wife's name.
She's… she's French.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
So you named it after her?

09:18.080 --> 09:19.320
I just said I did.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.720
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.400
I haven't had a huge amount of sleep.
I'm so sorry.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.520
Don't worry about it.

09:26.640 --> 09:27.600
I…

09:28.120 --> 09:30.440
Rude. Moody.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.360
Remember, "arsehole's" got an "E" in it…

09:32.440 --> 09:33.600
two "E"s actually.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.040
I really am…

09:35.520 --> 09:41.360
In three words,
what would you say Amandine means to you?

09:44.040 --> 09:45.360
- Three words?

09:47.640 --> 09:50.280
Amandine is-- here!

09:50.360 --> 09:51.640
Oh, my God. Hey.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.960
Erm, what are you--

09:53.040 --> 09:55.040
Er, I told you.
I lost my phone.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.160
Right. Yes.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.640
Erm, sorry, er, this is Amandine.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.040
- Amandine--
- Jamie, may I speak with you?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.480
Yeah.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.160
Thanks.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.640
The therapist said no big moves.

10:09.720 --> 10:13.400
- Look, if you're worried about money…
- I'm not worried about money. I'm not--

10:14.520 --> 10:16.640
I mean I am, of course, I'm not gonna…

10:17.520 --> 10:20.120
but I just-- what are you gonna do?

10:20.880 --> 10:23.880
I'm going to do what you do.

10:23.960 --> 10:24.960
You're gonna become a chef?

10:25.040 --> 10:27.120
No. Find my passion!

10:28.240 --> 10:29.880
You found yours.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.280
I need to find mine.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.320
I need to do this, Jamie.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.880
I absolutely totally
fucking need to do this,

10:37.000 --> 10:38.880
or I'm going to go crazy.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.520
All my life I believed in one thing.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.000
One thing really worth having.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.560
And if you lose it,
then you've lost everything.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.280
I've lost it.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.280
And I need to get it back.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.040
What?

11:13.360 --> 11:14.560
The Magic.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.240
Fuck it. It was a bullshit job.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.920
Fuck it.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.400
Thanks. Thanks.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.160
You got it.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.680
Oh, sweet music.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.880
That's good. That's good.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.240
- Hey, babe!
- Hey, what's going on?

11:56.320 --> 11:58.040
Hey! You must be Jamie.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.720
This is Dan,
he's my new teacher.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.960
Dan says my violin is amazing!

12:03.040 --> 12:04.120
Oh, my God.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.680
So this bad boy here

12:05.760 --> 12:08.960
is a Ludovico Rastelli,
Circa 1870 from Genoa.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.680
It's… it's balanced, it's muscular.

12:11.760 --> 12:12.840
- Incredible.
- Play something!

12:12.920 --> 12:14.720
Play what you played me.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.680
Okay, okay.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.680
Oh!

12:30.760 --> 12:33.040
You should get this valued
and insured.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.760
It's-- it's worth more than my car!

12:34.840 --> 12:37.040
No?! Isn't that unbelievable?

12:38.840 --> 12:40.760
It's totally unbelievable.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.760
Good afternoon, Mrs Geddis.

12:46.840 --> 12:47.920
You all right there?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.200
I'm returning this.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.440
Oh, great.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.080
Is-- Is there a problem?

12:54.720 --> 12:56.960
- It's impossible!
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.280
Oh, no.
Oh, no. It's all right, don't worry.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.760
Oh, no, it's all right. It's all right.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.440
Bye.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.480
So what's happening with you?
What's news?

13:13.680 --> 13:15.560
Well, no, nothing to report.

13:15.640 --> 13:16.800
And how's Jeff?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.600
He's in London.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.080
What did you get him for his birthday?

13:24.040 --> 13:26.000
Oh, fuck, fuck!

14:14.760 --> 14:16.160
Oh, fuck.

14:18.920 --> 14:22.400
Hi Lue, it's me, just checking in,
see how you're doing.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.000
See how the monkeys are.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.680
Call me back when you get a mo.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.240
Love you. Bye.

14:32.840 --> 14:36.000
Coco Chanel was born in 1883

14:36.080 --> 14:38.240
in the poor house in Saumur,
a market town on the River Loire…

14:38.320 --> 14:40.360
She would rise to become arguably

14:40.440 --> 14:43.600
the most influential fashion designer
of all time revolutionising…

14:43.680 --> 14:47.800
During her six years at Aubersin,
Chanel found employment as a seamstress…

14:47.880 --> 14:51.280
In 1918, Chanel purchased the building
at 31 rue Cambon

14:51.360 --> 14:52.800
in one of the most
fashionable districts…

14:52.880 --> 14:56.000
In 1921, she opened an early incarnation
of a fashion boutique…

14:56.080 --> 14:58.200
Young French ex- cavalry officer

14:58.280 --> 15:00.680
and textile heir Etienne Balsan.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.360
At the age of 23,
Chanel became Balsan's mistress…

15:03.440 --> 15:06.200
Her wedding dress was composed
of an elaborately gored

15:06.280 --> 15:08.400
and top stitched bodice and skirts,

15:08.480 --> 15:11.880
with a detachable train applique
and cream velvet flowers…

15:14.440 --> 15:18.720
With over 3,000 mother of pearl sequins,

15:18.800 --> 15:21.920
Coco's dress was beyond breath taking,

15:23.240 --> 15:24.840
it was a sensation.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.920
Sorrel Ravioli,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.480
- Skye Scallops…

15:48.560 --> 15:51.640
…roast veal sweetbread, quince, walnuts,

15:51.720 --> 15:53.240
smoked duck.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.640
Mains…

16:03.000 --> 16:05.240
Yo! Jamie, whassup?

16:05.320 --> 16:06.320
Hey.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.720
How's she getting on? Good?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.520
Ammy? Good. Real good.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.960
- I mean, it's early days…
- Sorry, stop.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.440
Who's Ammy?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.880
- Amandine.
- Right. But you said Ammy.

16:25.720 --> 16:26.880
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.200
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.400
- I didn't.
- Yes, you…

16:29.480 --> 16:32.400
What the f… fucking hell!

16:32.480 --> 16:34.880
- Ah, what, it's jus…
- Were you gonna punch me?!

16:34.960 --> 16:37.320
- No.
- Yeah, well, it kinda looked like it!

16:37.400 --> 16:39.280
I-- I was punching the fridge.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.600
Why?!

16:45.200 --> 16:46.800
I…

16:46.880 --> 16:50.880
I fucking bit under-- the kinda--
I'm fucking under quite a lot of pressure.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.920
So 'cause I was punching the fridge
'cause of food.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.360
'Cause it signifies food so…

16:58.720 --> 16:59.760
Okay, all right.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.440
Well, just, erm,
just a bit of a warning next time.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.960
Will do. Will do.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.480
So, you're gonna get a Michelin award?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.480
A what?

17:16.560 --> 17:18.560
- Michelin.
- Star. Michelin star.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.080
- We don't call it an award.
- It's a star.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.560
I would like to get one.
I doubt I will. Who told you that?

17:23.680 --> 17:24.680
Ammy.

17:28.880 --> 17:29.880
Uh…

17:30.520 --> 17:31.560
What's up?

17:33.560 --> 17:37.160
Erm, just getting a glass of water and…

17:37.240 --> 17:39.640
Well, I think
I nailed the C to the D.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.040
- What!?
- Come, listen!

17:41.080 --> 17:42.920
Ahh! Let's listen!

17:43.000 --> 17:44.560
Jamie, laters.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.800
Laters.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.080
Fucking hell.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.280
Mains…

18:00.160 --> 18:02.800
Happy Birthday, Amandine!

18:02.920 --> 18:04.320
Happy birthday, Amandine!

18:04.400 --> 18:05.880
Here we go! Oh!

18:08.920 --> 18:11.080
Max, Max, Max, take this, take this.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.560
Ammy, get in! Amandine!

18:12.640 --> 18:14.560
Budge up, budge up, budge up!
Okay, ready?

18:14.680 --> 18:16.800
Ready, ready, ready, okay here we go!

18:21.640 --> 18:23.080
So I got it valued.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.160
- What?
- Well, the violin.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.280
- When?
- This afternoon.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.280
- We went to this place.
- We?

18:29.320 --> 18:31.080
- Me and Dan.
- You went with Dan?

18:31.160 --> 18:32.800
Guess how much it was?

18:32.920 --> 18:34.240
- No idea.
- Guess.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.960
- I wouldn't even know where to start.
- Guess!

18:38.240 --> 18:39.920
- Five grand.
- Cold.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.080
- Ten grand.
- Stone cold.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.480
- Twenty grand.
- Warmer.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.640
Just tell me.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.800
Sixty or seventy thousand!

18:47.920 --> 18:49.560
Oh, my-- that's incredible!

18:49.640 --> 18:51.560
It's fucking insane!

18:51.680 --> 18:53.480
You know Dan says that
there are only a couple hundred of them

18:53.560 --> 18:54.560
left in the world.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.800
- Did he really?
- Yeah.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.200
- We should get it insured.
- Yeah…

18:58.280 --> 18:59.320
we should.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.560
Dan has a concert
tomorrow night

19:04.680 --> 19:06.000
at the Queen Elizabeth Hall.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.560
Oh, yeah.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.520
Yeah, he's the lead violinist.

19:10.560 --> 19:15.000
They call the lead V the Concertmaster,
so Dan's the Concertmaster.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.920
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.320
It's only a couple of hours.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.280
It'll be good for you
to get away for a while.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.160
Okay, great.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.440
Hey. Hey, come round the back.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.320
- Briggsy, you finish up prep for me.
- Yep.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.400
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.640
- How's it going? Good.
- Good.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.880
- What is it?
- It's a video. It's not good.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.160
- Play it.
- Jamie, you don't wanna see it.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.280
- Play it.
- Are you sure?

19:59.320 --> 20:02.560
Yes, play it. Play it now. .

20:08.320 --> 20:09.640
Where do you want me?

20:09.720 --> 20:12.400
Where do you want me?

20:39.240 --> 20:41.280
- Thanks.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.320
- Thanks a lot.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.480
Jame.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.320
Er, Vogue, Vani Fair

20:47.400 --> 20:49.200
and The Times
all confirmed for opening night.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.720
Thank you.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.960
So, that's Paul?

21:05.040 --> 21:06.080
No.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.000
That's Jason.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.320
Jason Burke. Commercials director.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.480
They met at a marketing conference
in Edinburgh.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.200
They were staying in the same hotel.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.960
So not Paul.

21:22.800 --> 21:23.800
Or Dave.

21:29.560 --> 21:30.800
Jason.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.800
Is his number in there?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.440
- Yes.
- Call him.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.680
- I can't.
- Call him now. Yes, you can.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.760
- Jamie.
- Yes, you can.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.720
- I can't call him!
- Yes, you fucking can. Why not?!

21:45.640 --> 21:48.560
He was on the A305 near Stonehenge.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.440
Taking a selfie
with the henge in the background,

21:51.520 --> 21:54.280
when he hit an Ocado van
coming the other way.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.640
He was in the Wiltshire Gazette
and Herald.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.760
Good.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.920
I hope he broke every bone in his body.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
No, I don't.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.920
I hope-- I hope he got decapitated
and his head came off

22:05.000 --> 22:06.160
and it took them weeks to find it.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.640
I hope they didn't find it.

22:07.720 --> 22:11.040
I hope it's still out there rotting
with a family of rats and…

22:35.680 --> 22:39.080
Take that back to Devon and rip it apart.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.840
I need to know everything,
I need to know if it's five,

22:41.920 --> 22:44.760
seven, twelve, all right?

22:44.840 --> 22:47.040
I've gotta know everything, all right?

22:48.400 --> 22:49.600
Jamie, you…

22:51.240 --> 22:52.600
You forgot your clog.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.200
You're all right, mate.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.480
Jamie?

23:17.920 --> 23:22.440
Even as a lowly seamstress,
Coco's needlework singled her out.

23:22.520 --> 23:26.400
The split stitch, stem stitch,
satin stitch, the French hem.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.320
Coco swiftly mastered them all.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.680
It was this attention to detail
to every seam, hem, darn, or embroidery

23:32.760 --> 23:35.600
that'd set her on the path to greatness,
to genius,

23:36.840 --> 23:39.520
not just of her age, but for all time.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.160
Ah!

24:29.480 --> 24:31.440
- Congratulations.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.760
- Well done!
- Really fantastic, loved it.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.400
- Love it.
- Shall we, er, grab a drink?

24:36.480 --> 24:37.520
- We'd love to!
- We'd love to

24:37.600 --> 24:39.280
but we've got the babysitter, so…

24:39.360 --> 24:43.000
Er, well why don't you go back,
I'll get a drink with Danny,

24:43.080 --> 24:44.080
meet you at home?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.400
Laters, J- Dog!

24:47.480 --> 24:48.480
It's beautiful.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.880
- Oh, thank you.
- That was crazy!

24:49.960 --> 24:51.800
I don't even understand
how you play like that!

25:21.200 --> 25:23.320
- How was it?
- Yeah.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.240
It was amazing.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.080
Lue?
