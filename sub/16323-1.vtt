02:03.760 --> 02:06.911

02:06.960 --> 02:09.473
in the gutter:..

02:09.520 --> 02:13.798
where poor young street urchins
Mickey. Donald. and Goofy...

02:13.840 --> 02:15.717
struggled to survive.

gives Mickey a gift.

the years passed...

02:50.280 --> 02:53.590
their dream was still
as far away as ever:

02:53.640 --> 02:56.473
You see, before
their dream can come true...

02:56.520 --> 02:59.432
our three heroes must learn
the real meaning...

03:01.080 --> 03:04.072
of the musketeer creed--
all for one and one for all!

03:04.200 --> 03:07.749
