WEBVTT

00:13.430 --> 00:14.764
[Nate] Here's the rest of it.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.271
Weird, right?

00:21.354 --> 00:22.355
What's that?

00:23.982 --> 00:25.316
Being reduced to a box.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.989
-Where is his daughter?
-With the ex.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.533
-How's she doing?
-Never been better.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.660
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

00:35.744 --> 00:39.497
Random robbery, dad gets slaughtered.
She can't wait for Christmas.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.250
None of it's right.

00:45.920 --> 00:46.963
Any leads?

00:47.046 --> 00:49.799
[scoffs] Just every dirtbag with a prior.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.708
[Henry] What are you gonna do?

01:23.792 --> 01:25.710
I have a month of banked vacay.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.420
Aren't you suspended for three?

01:27.504 --> 01:29.130
So I'll get a Peloton after.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.799
Do that before the vacation.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.093
Don't let this die, okay?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.262
Nothing can survive here.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.182
I grabbed your mail, too.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.314
Why didn't I leave Detroit when you did?

01:46.397 --> 01:49.108
'Cause you're not smart enough
to know it's all pointless.

01:49.734 --> 01:52.946
Hey, did, uh… Did Dave say anything
about our last night there?

01:54.239 --> 01:58.576
He, like, made this noise
I've actually never heard a man make.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.870
It was like high-pitched.

02:01.621 --> 02:05.416
I think we're gonna go
on vacation, like Playa del Carmen.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.420
They like gays in Puerto Rico.
I think he'll like that.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.006
How could his wife not know?

02:15.260 --> 02:16.344
She knows?

02:23.518 --> 02:25.436
What's that going to do?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.313
We'd be protected.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.857
You'll be protected.

02:29.524 --> 02:34.362
I think the question is how does
you being on City Council protect us?

02:34.445 --> 02:37.073
Because I'd finally
have some real leverage.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.367
You kind of already do.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.661
How?

02:41.744 --> 02:45.165
I mean, he's not gonna
mess with somebody he wants to, uh…

02:45.248 --> 02:46.791
-Don't.
-…finger paint.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.752
-That's gross.
-Pick your lock?

02:49.836 --> 02:52.881
-Somehow worse.
-Give you the double gopher.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.674
You see where we're going with this.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.426
I mean, some real leverage.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.970
Like, if he wants to
throw you in a freezer again,

02:59.053 --> 03:01.014
I would have the city on my side.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.224
-[Annie sighs]
-What happened to Nevada?

03:04.392 --> 03:05.226
Nothing.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.979
We don't have to worry
about the freezer in Nevada, right?

03:08.062 --> 03:10.481
Yeah, but I'd like to
get us there in one piece.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.858
It's a pretty big detour.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.944
You don't stop in Miami
on your way to Vegas.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.404
Okay, chill.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.532
Gosh, it wasn't even my idea.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.368
Whose idea was it?

03:24.996 --> 03:27.957
-Brother-cousin.
-[Ruby] Hmm.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.210
[Ruby laughs]

03:31.294 --> 03:33.755
-What?
-[laughing] Okay.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.966
That is not why he suggested it.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.010
I mean, isn't it?

03:39.719 --> 03:42.555
-He said he could use me.
-Oh, I bet he could.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.265
A mom like me.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.269
And I'm guessing he also has fingers.

03:48.978 --> 03:53.149
All right, forget it.
I'll tell him to ask someone else.

03:54.275 --> 03:55.193
Sheesh!

03:57.028 --> 04:01.241
There's no one else. Now, we don't have
to fill the seat right away,

04:01.324 --> 04:05.370
so why don't you just take a minute
and realize why I'm right.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.373
[chuckles] Okay.
Take longer than a minute.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.417
Yeah, but I'm not going to give in easy.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.503
All right.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.881
All right. Talk to you later. Bye.

04:20.551 --> 04:24.180
-Maybe she's just not that into you.
-Mmm.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.391
She'll come around.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.228
Chicks like that
don't need to be romanced.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.398
Oh, yeah? What does she need?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.901
Someone to yank her by that ponytail.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.196
That's not my style, brother.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.117
You want her in that seat, right?

04:49.455 --> 04:50.373
What would you do?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.378
I'd give her what she needs.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.091
I know what you need.

05:00.925 --> 05:01.759
What's that?

05:02.468 --> 05:05.054
-You need to stop eating this burger.
-Yo.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.390
Gotta make weight.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.935
Always want what I already have, huh?

05:11.561 --> 05:12.687
Always get it, too.

05:12.770 --> 05:13.855
[moans]

05:22.280 --> 05:23.323
[rattling]

05:37.170 --> 05:38.546
[rattling continues]

05:57.732 --> 05:58.775
[Annie exclaims]

05:59.358 --> 06:00.526
-[Kevin exclaims]
-[grunts]

06:01.652 --> 06:04.322
-Stop! Annie!
-What are you doing?

06:04.405 --> 06:05.740
What are you doing?

06:05.823 --> 06:08.618
-I thought you were breaking in.
-My key didn't work.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.079
Well, yeah, because the lock is broken.

06:12.413 --> 06:14.999
Is that why your entire
kitchen's on the floor?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.417
It's my alarm system.

06:17.043 --> 06:17.877
[sighs]

06:19.253 --> 06:20.088
Worked.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.801
-Where have you been?
-Angela's.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.305
Well, you missed all the action.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.265
I did all right.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.142
I meant here.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.480
[hesitates]

06:37.563 --> 06:39.107
Where are you going now?

06:40.149 --> 06:41.192
Gotta get back.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.903
Angela could stay here.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.864
I wouldn't want to break your rules.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.117
I'll make an exception.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.578
[sighs]

06:53.746 --> 06:54.956
We might order food.

06:55.039 --> 06:58.793
I could also order food.
We could all three watch a movie or--

06:58.876 --> 07:00.837
She asked me to move in with her.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.589
Already?

07:05.091 --> 07:06.425
This my avocado knife?

07:08.052 --> 07:08.886
It's not.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.471
Can I have it?

07:11.055 --> 07:11.889
[grunts]

07:13.766 --> 07:14.809
Don't you just…

07:15.351 --> 07:17.019
think it might be a little soon?

07:17.937 --> 07:19.897
It is better than couch-surfing.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.194
Okay, well, then… you can sleep in my bed.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.282
I mean, I'll stay in Ben's room.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.868
Why would you do that?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.204
Because we had a deal.

07:37.373 --> 07:40.126
Just tell the school I still live here.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.129
Wait.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.089
Please, I…

07:46.090 --> 07:47.258
I don't wanna be alone.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.554
Neither do I.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.058
[utensils rattle]

08:12.658 --> 08:15.995
-What's all this?
-I need to get them out of here.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.831
What about our money?

08:21.334 --> 08:24.795
Should've thought about that before you
told Eli's mom she bought a fake.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.592
-It just came out.
-Well… it's all over the parent chain.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.348
-Oh, no.
-Yeah. They threatened to call the cops.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.850
-What did you say?
-It was a mistake.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.062
-That's good.
-And I refunded all their money.

08:41.145 --> 08:44.315
-Not good.
-Well, what else was I supposed to do?

08:44.398 --> 08:46.484
-This was our way out.
-It was.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.402
And not just for us.

08:50.988 --> 08:51.948
Do you feel that?

08:54.575 --> 08:56.702
-What?
-The <i>déjà vu.</i>

08:58.579 --> 08:59.789
This isn't Beth's fault.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.668
Go out with her for one night, come back
with problems that last you forever.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.044
We'll find another way out.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.420
She'll screw that up, too.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.841
Goodwill will be here in the morning.

09:12.802 --> 09:13.678
Stan.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.430
This one was mine.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.483
[Annie] I was just like,
"What is he even doing in there?"

09:27.567 --> 09:30.820
[Beth] He's probably built up filth
because he's been homeless.

09:30.903 --> 09:34.865
[groans] He might as well be showering
in Cristal for what it's costing me.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.451
-What if he took baths?
-He moved out.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.413
Problem solved.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.040
Still can't pay the water bill.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.836
-We need another purse party.
-[Annie] Mmm.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.254
Okay.

09:48.337 --> 09:50.006
Check with the girls, would you?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.925
-Totally.
-Get something on the books.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.679
It might not be right away.

09:58.806 --> 09:59.640
How come?

10:01.142 --> 10:03.436
Just, you know, some issues.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.605
What kind of issues?

10:07.732 --> 10:08.733
Inventory?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.986
[muffled R&amp;B music playing]

10:18.242 --> 10:19.702
[music continues]

10:24.707 --> 10:28.377
So, a dealership, never really my thing.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.547
Spas… What are those even for?

10:33.007 --> 10:33.924
But this…

10:35.009 --> 10:37.345
This is how we make dreams come true.

10:37.928 --> 10:38.846
Not "we."

10:40.681 --> 10:42.183
Public record, darling.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.893
This is ours.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.979
A little Lysol, lot of love.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.648
This is just where we print.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.651
-Clean this place right up.
-Not a place to wash.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.404
It is now.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.662
We know nothing
about running a strip club.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.623
Didn't know much
about cars or hot tubs, either.

11:09.919 --> 11:10.836
How much?

11:16.342 --> 11:17.385
How much what?

11:19.261 --> 11:20.513
Our cut.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.937
-Why would I do that?
-You know how this goes.

11:31.816 --> 11:35.319
-How clean do you want your money?
-Oh, I want it to sparkle.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.114
-You get what you pay for.
-What are you doing?

11:44.286 --> 11:47.164
Maybe we could work something out.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.219
Don't be mad.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.555
-I'm not mad.
-She's mad.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.181
We were out.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.518
-Not exactly.
-We were more out than in.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.981
You know how you protect us?
By doing exactly what he says.

12:14.358 --> 12:15.776
At least now we're getting paid.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.695
That's what the purses are for.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.031
The purses are gone.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.828
Can't we just make more?

12:25.911 --> 12:28.122
Not without getting Harry
kicked out of school.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.667
-Oh, no.
-What happened?

12:32.209 --> 12:34.295
-I said a thing.
-She said a thing.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.212
Oh, no.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.883
So, without this, it is bye-bye, Nevada.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.595
-[Krystal] Hey, bitches.
-Hey.

12:42.678 --> 12:43.512
I'm starving.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.976
Yo. Hey.
Let me get a Reuben sandwich, okay?

12:49.059 --> 12:50.728
Extra Russian dressing.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.354
What kind of fries you got?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.940
-Steak, skinny, curly.
-Okay.

12:56.775 --> 12:58.736
-Which one?
-All three.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.452
Okay, so we have two parties coming up,

13:06.535 --> 13:09.622
and we can stick these guys
with at least ten purses.

13:09.705 --> 13:10.664
[Ruby] Change of plans.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.834
-Okay.
-Need you back at the club.

13:15.794 --> 13:19.006
-What do you mean?
-It's opening back up.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.134
[scoffs]

13:23.052 --> 13:24.470
That's not going to happen.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.847
Why not?

13:28.432 --> 13:31.560
-The girls have moved on.
-Can't we get them back?

13:32.353 --> 13:34.939
Oh, no. Gene treated us like garbage.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.441
Well, there's new management.

13:43.072 --> 13:43.906
Who?

13:45.741 --> 13:46.742
[inaudible]

13:57.044 --> 13:57.920
[mouthing] Hi.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.636
[inaudible]

14:10.349 --> 14:11.183
[mouthing] Hey.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.143
[mouthing] What?

14:13.227 --> 14:14.603
[mouthing] Come here.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.691
[mouthing] What?

14:35.291 --> 14:38.002
-All of us.
-We'll treat it like a partnership.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.837
Split the costs and profits.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.256
Instead of just dancing on the table…

14:42.339 --> 14:44.758
You'll finally have a seat at it.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.514
So… what do you guys think?

14:55.686 --> 14:56.729
[woman exclaims]

15:01.859 --> 15:04.820
[Julie] Babe, the geraniums
don't go with the snapdragons.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.281
[Dave] I'm planting everything
that's in the flats.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.617
We've got purple on top of lavender.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.745
-[Dave] So?
-They clash, babe.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.164
It's the exact same color.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.542
-[chuckles] You're such a dude.
-Cowboy.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.213
Sorry, the gate was open.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.132
Babe, this is Agent Donegan.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.760
She was with me in Detroit.

15:28.385 --> 15:32.181
-Thanks for keeping him in line.
-He's a pretty straight shooter.

15:33.807 --> 15:37.436
Well, my trainer's on her way.
Babe, just make it look pretty.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.861
I tried to sway the director.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.365
-It's not your fault.
-But it was under my watch.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.283
[Phoebe] I'm the one who lost the money.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.118
You didn't lose it.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.621
You just got played.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.082
I'll be okay.

15:59.583 --> 16:03.629
-Wish there was something more I could do.
-There is.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.257
[Dave] Can you, um, help me water here?

16:17.518 --> 16:18.477
Come with me.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.855
Where are you going?

16:22.648 --> 16:23.482
Detroit.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.329
-You're off the clock.
-It's my vacation.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.999
-They'll never authorize this.
-They will for you.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.333
We lost, kid.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.919
-We didn't connect the dots.
-It's for someone else.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.214
-It's not just about money.
-It's not our jurisdiction.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.384
He's got the city in his pocket.
You're going to plant petunias?

16:51.677 --> 16:52.720
Geraniums.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.930
-Well, they're beautiful.
-Thank you.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.184
With a garden like that,
who cares he slaughtered a cop,

16:59.268 --> 17:01.645
card store girl
and a team of federal agents?

17:02.646 --> 17:04.815
You need a real vacation.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.318
And you need to separate
the purple ones, babe.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.788
I found this in my underwear a while ago.

17:20.706 --> 17:21.623
[Z] Wow.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.210
Look at the quality.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.921
I didn't touch it,
those are all her prints.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.339
Sweet.

17:30.174 --> 17:35.345
And, uh… [clears throat]
I got this from my wife's cell.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.560
They're just talking about
going to a book club.

17:41.643 --> 17:45.314
-No, it's code.
-Yeah. Nobody was doing any reading.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.317
We made a whole list with timestamps.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.403
Correlates with when she left
in the middle of the night.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.323
-Making her drops.
-[Dean] Maybe we can use the towers.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.826
However they do that.
Maybe that's how you track the money.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.454
I mean, is that enough?

18:01.288 --> 18:02.456
It's up to the DA.

18:04.666 --> 18:05.667
Wait.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.216
What's gonna happen to her?

18:12.966 --> 18:15.886
Everything that never
should have happened to you.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.685
It's the right thing, Dean.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.939
Easy for you to say. It's not your wife.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.068
She brought it on herself.

18:38.992 --> 18:39.910
[Stan clears throat]

18:39.993 --> 18:42.704
-Listen to this guy.
-He knows what's up.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.082
I'm trying to help out a friend.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.962
You'll fit in great with the team.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.090
-How's that?
-I got your territory all set.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.592
Work under Dean
till you get the program down.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.555
I'm not really looking
for a career change.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.724
No, no, no.
That's the wrong way to think about it.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.642
Yeah.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.186
No disrespect.

19:14.194 --> 19:18.532
The night renewal cream
is really flying off the shelves.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.245
Let's not talk shop in front of tourists.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.708
No disrespect.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.710
It's all good.

19:35.883 --> 19:36.717
[Dean exhales]

19:37.801 --> 19:40.387
[host on TV] <i>Showing real people…</i>

19:40.470 --> 19:41.889
[door handle rattles]

19:41.972 --> 19:44.641
<i>Stains on T-shirts comin' out…</i>

19:49.354 --> 19:50.647
[objects clatter]

19:54.776 --> 19:56.570
When are you gonna
get that lock fixed?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.615
-Why are you home?
-I live here.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.576
But you have the tournament.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.286
Yeah.

20:04.953 --> 20:05.787
Oh.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.292
So, uh…

20:11.043 --> 20:14.129
You guys need, like, a chaperone or…

20:14.671 --> 20:16.840
-Uh, Dad's doing it.
-Oh.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.510
What about a water girl?

20:21.511 --> 20:22.804
What's going on?

20:23.680 --> 20:25.933
What? Nothing.

20:28.143 --> 20:28.977
[Annie] Mmm.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.149
Ever get the feeling you're going
to be kidnapped and murdered?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.193
-I'm gonna skip the tournament.
-No, no.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.362
-It's one game.
-It's the semifinals.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.158
Why don't you stay with Aunt Beth?

20:43.242 --> 20:47.246
Ugh. Because those kids wake up at 8:00.
I'd rather get murdered.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.789
Where'd Kevin go?

20:48.872 --> 20:50.082
His girlfriend.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.335
-Where's Martha gonna go?
-Who?

20:53.418 --> 20:57.464
-His friend with the green shopping cart.
-How do you know her?

20:57.547 --> 21:00.342
Martha and Tom come over
to do laundry when you're at work.

21:00.884 --> 21:01.843
Of course they do.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.722
Rollerblade Roy just shows
and watches <i>Maddow</i> sometimes.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.058
The rest of them crash
behind the food court at the mall.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.018
They throw out everything there.

21:10.102 --> 21:15.482
Panda Express, Steak Escape,
Wetzel's Pretzels, Hot Dog on a Stick.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.572
[footsteps approaching]

21:23.240 --> 21:26.076
I think I finally figured out
this bedtime thing.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.494
Only took four kids.

21:27.577 --> 21:31.498
Promise them anything they want,
and they sleep with a smile.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.293
-What happens when they wake up?
-They've forgotten.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.586
So you lie?

21:37.254 --> 21:38.797
I'm open to suggestions.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.134
Try holding a pillow
over their faces till they pass out.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.136
Wow.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.181
-Let me know how that goes.
-I'm on mornings. So…

21:48.890 --> 21:53.353
Well, I might be working
more nights from now on.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.189
Why?

21:57.024 --> 22:00.777
He's just throwing a lot at us these days.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.280
All right.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.616
You gotta do what you gotta do.

22:09.161 --> 22:09.995
Thanks.

22:12.247 --> 22:13.707
Don't miss too many bedtimes.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.047
Never know how many you got left.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.675
They don't grow up that fast.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.184
Reservation?

22:32.267 --> 22:33.518
Angela, right?

22:34.561 --> 22:36.688
Sorry. Annie. I'm Kevin's old roommate.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.565
-Oh, my God. Hi.
-[Annie] Hey.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.318
I'm sorry to bother you.
I couldn't get a hold of him.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.903
Oh, he's probably at my place.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.654
Oh, yeah, of course. Makes sense.

22:44.738 --> 22:48.992
With his phone number always changing
'cause the prepaid phones and all that.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.118
He uses those?

22:50.202 --> 22:54.873
Yeah. That, or the pay phone
at the bus station, which he swears works.

22:54.956 --> 22:58.627
-Gross.
-Yeah. Speaking of, here.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.504
[Annie groans]

23:00.587 --> 23:01.797
He left this behind.

23:02.339 --> 23:05.050
-What is that?
-His bathroom.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.761
He poops in there?

23:07.844 --> 23:11.389
Oh, yeah.
Poops, showers, shaves, the works.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.225
He can use my bathroom.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.561
You know Kev, creature of habit. [scoffs]

23:16.645 --> 23:18.021
-Uh…
-[Annie] Oh!

23:18.105 --> 23:21.691
He also forgot to take these.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.985
[Angela] Condiments?

23:24.069 --> 23:25.487
I have all this stuff.

23:26.696 --> 23:29.533
In my experience,
you're gonna wanna double up.

23:30.992 --> 23:31.827
Why?

23:32.619 --> 23:34.371
Well, he doesn't believe in silverware,

23:34.454 --> 23:38.625
so when you combine that with the bucket,
it just gets a little dicey.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.589
Why are you doing this?

23:46.341 --> 23:48.510
Just to help you prepare.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.180
Or maybe you're jealous…

23:54.015 --> 23:56.560
-What?
-or lonely, or just, like, psycho.

23:56.643 --> 23:59.312
-Okay.
-I'm cool with Kevin.

23:59.396 --> 24:02.274
-[Annie] That's great.
-I like that he's different.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.901
Hey, he's all yours.

24:06.778 --> 24:07.904
Thanks.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.370
-ATM?
-Check.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.414
-Liquor vendors?
-[Ruby] Check.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.708
-Dry cleaning?
-Gene put in coin op machines.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.667
Set up an account.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.086
<i>-Trash removal?</i>
-[Ruby] <i>Underway.</i>

24:25.005 --> 24:27.799
-How are you on diapers?
-This one had a major blowout.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.927
-Okay, I'll make sure you're stocked.
-Health insurance forms.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.762
Make sure all the girls get one of those.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.348
Some ladies outside
want to talk to the managers?

24:41.229 --> 24:42.189
Can we help you?

24:43.857 --> 24:45.567
We're here about the dancing.

24:46.943 --> 24:48.612
Oh. Auditions are Tuesday.

24:48.695 --> 24:49.738
Fully nude?

24:50.572 --> 24:52.991
Um, we leave that up to the performer.

24:53.074 --> 24:57.245
Do you know how many kids ride their bikes
past here every single day?

24:58.788 --> 25:01.374
Uh, we're fully zoned and licensed.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.835
Mmm. Not anymore.

25:07.547 --> 25:10.425
There's enough there
to keep you from opening.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.559
Your turn in the freezer.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.026
[host on TV] <i>Just a little bit off…</i>

25:31.112 --> 25:32.155
<i>But for sure,</i>

25:32.239 --> 25:34.074
<i>I think she was a little quick…</i>

25:34.157 --> 25:35.283
[knocking at door]

25:36.243 --> 25:38.662
Don't need a turndown, thanks.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.414
<i>And that's caused a really shallow…</i>

25:41.498 --> 25:42.540
[knocking at door]

25:42.624 --> 25:45.335
Haven't left my bed
since the last turndown.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.462
[Dave] Not housekeeping.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.175
[exhales]

25:52.842 --> 25:55.345
It took me three flights to get here.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.390
-Why?
-I used miles.

26:00.141 --> 26:03.186
-Why?
-We're both on vacation.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.697
You better give me money for that.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.075
-It's mine, too.
-How?

26:18.326 --> 26:19.286
We're roommates.

26:19.786 --> 26:22.622
[chuckles] Department chief can't spring
for his own room?

26:24.332 --> 26:25.667
In the middle of something.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.877
My funds are limited.

26:28.545 --> 26:29.546
My wife left me.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.050
This is all you got, huh?

26:35.302 --> 26:39.139
-What happened?
-We'll still have to track a motive.

26:39.222 --> 26:40.390
No, why did she leave?

26:44.269 --> 26:48.815
I told her that I like
a more diverse garden.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.361
[Phoebe sighs]

26:53.445 --> 26:54.529
So what now?

26:56.823 --> 26:57.949
We get him.

27:05.081 --> 27:06.082
[exhales]

27:12.630 --> 27:13.923
I fart in my sleep.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.843
I watch an unhealthy amount of porn.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.806
We're going to be just fine.

27:27.645 --> 27:29.773
What is Family First Alliance?

27:29.856 --> 27:31.816
Not a group you want on your bad side.

27:32.525 --> 27:35.737
Women have been naked
in that dump for over a decade.

27:35.820 --> 27:39.407
-Yeah, when ownership transferred--
-But it's the same place.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.492
Community has a say.

27:40.575 --> 27:41.576
[sighs]

27:41.659 --> 27:44.287
-I don't even want to do this.
-Then don't.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.624
Oh, sure. So your brother
can come for the rest of my family.

27:47.707 --> 27:48.833
Not my brother.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.420
What is he exactly?

27:54.339 --> 27:55.256
Blood.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.637
You are my elected official.

28:01.554 --> 28:04.474
-So?
-So you're supposed to be helpful.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.352
-You want this problem to go away?
-Yes.

28:07.435 --> 28:09.270
Then run for City Council.

28:10.146 --> 28:12.482
-I'm just a mom.
-I was just a caddie.

28:14.150 --> 28:16.611
What's a plain old mom supposed to do?

28:17.904 --> 28:18.780
Fight.

28:19.489 --> 28:20.323
How?

28:21.199 --> 28:24.369
[Denise] Studies show crime goes up
around a strip club.

28:24.452 --> 28:29.999
Assault, random victimization,
drunk driving and public indecency.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.795
This is what we live in fear of
when we take our dog for a walk,

28:33.878 --> 28:37.882
or our kids to a school
that is right around the corner?

28:37.966 --> 28:39.509
What crawled up her butt?

28:40.135 --> 28:44.055
We ask you tonight to restore
family values to our community

28:44.139 --> 28:48.143
and to finally shut down
this lawless den of sin.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.103
Thank you.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.491
Anyone else like to speak on this matter?

29:10.331 --> 29:12.500
Okay. If there are no objections,
we'll move to--

29:12.584 --> 29:15.879
Just a second.
Someone still has the floor.

29:16.755 --> 29:20.633
Yes. [clears throat] I'd like to read
a statement I've prepared.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.432
-[Annie clears throat]
-Oh, boy.

29:29.100 --> 29:33.396
From the oldest of times,
people danced for a number of reasons.

29:35.148 --> 29:39.652
They danced in prayer,
or so that their crops would be plentiful,

29:40.236 --> 29:41.529
or so that their hunt…

29:41.613 --> 29:42.906
Is she doing <i>Footloose?</i>

29:42.989 --> 29:44.824
I couldn't talk her out of it.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.743
Well, it worked for Bacon.

29:46.826 --> 29:50.830
They danced to stay physically fit
and show their community spirit.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.457
-And they danced--
-[Beth] Thank you.

29:53.374 --> 29:54.292
Thank you.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.130
[inaudible conversation]

29:59.881 --> 30:05.470
Um, I would also like to respond to what
the woman from Families First said.

30:06.429 --> 30:09.098
Uh, I respect that you're a mother.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.059
I am also a mother.

30:11.893 --> 30:15.980
Um, in fact, we're all mothers.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.233
Right, Krystal?

30:18.817 --> 30:22.362
I drop my first grader off
at that school right around the corner

30:22.445 --> 30:23.905
before I go to the club.

30:24.447 --> 30:26.366
My little girl's in third grade there.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.660
My son's in college.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.162
-She looks incredible.
-[Ruby exclaims]

30:31.246 --> 30:33.832
We're all just trying to make a living.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.168
There's a lot of other ways to do that.

30:38.753 --> 30:39.587
Fine.

30:40.463 --> 30:41.381
But…

30:42.298 --> 30:45.218
do they all benefit our economy
the way ours does?

30:46.553 --> 30:48.680
-Is Mr. Samborski here?
-Right here.

30:48.763 --> 30:49.973
[Beth] This is Mr. Samborski.

30:50.056 --> 30:53.017
He owns the 24-hour donut shop
right next to the club.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.145
My sales between 2:00 and 5:00 a.m.
have gone way down

30:56.229 --> 30:57.981
since Sweet P's closed.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.732
That's one business.

30:59.816 --> 31:02.151
I own a jewelry store.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.863
When Sweet P's was open,
we did so much better.

31:05.989 --> 31:10.368
Husbands are, uh, way more generous
with their wives when they feel guilty.

31:10.451 --> 31:11.703
[Beth and Annie chuckle]

31:11.786 --> 31:14.414
[woman 1] The guys always pregame
at my sports bar.

31:14.497 --> 31:17.208
We need those girls
to take their clothes off again.

31:17.292 --> 31:21.379
See? Whether they're dancing in a club
or speaking in a boardroom

31:21.462 --> 31:23.506
or baking in a kitchen,

31:23.590 --> 31:26.718
these women are making
a difference in our community.

31:27.343 --> 31:32.390
And aren't those values
just as important to show our children?

31:38.771 --> 31:40.690
Thank you for listening. [chuckles]

31:43.109 --> 31:44.193
[Annie exclaims]

31:45.612 --> 31:47.405
-[Ruby murmurs]
-How'd I do?

31:47.488 --> 31:49.157
You brought home the bacon.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.703
[woman 2] Next up after the vote,

31:54.621 --> 31:57.498
Ordinance 06.82.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.834
The length of retractable dog leashes.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.336
Ooh. I gotta hear this.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.302
Open for business.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.470
[women cheering]

32:13.389 --> 32:15.141
-Congrats.
-[Annie] Thanks, baby.

32:15.224 --> 32:17.018
-So exciting.
-Congrats, partner.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.102
Yes! Whoo!

32:20.897 --> 32:21.731
Huh.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.776
So, what should we toast to?

32:25.902 --> 32:28.363
Ah… to our new venture.

32:29.072 --> 32:32.158
Most of which we give to the man
who put you in a freezer.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.622
Why are we even celebrating?

32:39.332 --> 32:40.166
[Phoebe] Hey, guys.

32:41.793 --> 32:42.710
Miss us?

32:50.593 --> 32:51.552
What's all that?

32:53.304 --> 32:54.222
Redemption.

32:55.723 --> 32:56.557
Huh?

32:58.267 --> 33:01.229
We are ice cream social chairs,
running a car wash thing,

33:01.312 --> 33:03.439
holiday boutique, concert committee.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.901
Is that enough to keep the cops away?

33:06.985 --> 33:09.445
Hopefully, it's enough
to keep him in that school.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.532
-The car wash is all you.
-Yeah.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.996
-What's all that?
-Putting in a spice rack.

33:26.671 --> 33:27.672
[Stan] Hell no.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.383
-Oh, I'm not getting on it.
-Well, who…

33:31.676 --> 33:34.095
-Hell to the no.
-I think it's fun.

33:34.178 --> 33:37.473
-For you.
-My own private champagne room.

33:37.557 --> 33:41.352
-What am I? A piece of meat?
-Tonight? No. Tonight…

33:42.645 --> 33:43.896
you're a fireman.

33:43.980 --> 33:44.814
[chuckles]

33:46.190 --> 33:50.194
-Where'd you even get this?
-Replaced the old ones.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.032
What's going on, baby?

33:54.115 --> 33:56.034
We're opening the club back up.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.246
Who's "we"?

34:00.329 --> 34:03.708
All of us.
Me, the girls, even the dancers.

34:06.502 --> 34:08.546
Okay, yeah. You can't do that.

34:09.380 --> 34:13.259
Before you get weird,
I'm just as much an owner as Beth is.

34:13.885 --> 34:14.886
[Stan sighs]

34:16.054 --> 34:16.929
Ruby…

34:17.847 --> 34:21.142
This is our new way out.
We don't even need the bags.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.354
Is this a done deal?

34:26.606 --> 34:27.857
We're legit.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.236
There might even be a job in it for you.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.154
For me?

34:50.922 --> 34:52.757
[boys chattering indistinctly]

34:56.761 --> 34:58.846
[Vance] Who's next? Dennis, Tyler.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.683
What do we look for?
We look for weaknesses. Right?

35:02.767 --> 35:03.601
[blows whistle]

35:03.684 --> 35:07.688
Let's go. There you go.
No retreat, no surrender, Tyler.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.609
He's bigger, but you might be better.
Tyler, don't back up! Get in there.

35:11.692 --> 35:13.986
Dennis, attack! Good.

35:14.070 --> 35:14.987
[Dennis grunting]

35:16.114 --> 35:16.948
[blows whistle]

35:17.031 --> 35:20.118
All right, let's take a break.
Dennis, help Tyler up.

35:21.119 --> 35:25.164
Caleb, we're not giving out
crying patches. Join the group. Let's go.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.208
Today. Let's go. [blows whistle]

35:29.377 --> 35:33.548
-Son's trying to get his fitness patch.
-Yeah, this is important.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.675
Make it quick.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.010
So…

35:38.928 --> 35:42.098
it turns out that Beth's
not the only one that's going down.

35:43.057 --> 35:43.891
So?

35:44.475 --> 35:46.853
So, my wife's in it, too.

35:50.815 --> 35:51.858
More the merrier.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.569
You can't give that stuff to the DA.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.700
You put me in a tough spot.
I am Team Dean all the way.

36:00.783 --> 36:02.535
I need you to drag your feet.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.621
Why would I do that?

36:06.789 --> 36:07.874
Come on, man.

36:08.666 --> 36:11.460
Be a different story
if you were one of us. But…

36:11.544 --> 36:15.131
-[Tyler screams]
-Dennis, stop whipping Tyler.

36:17.884 --> 36:21.012
If I'm gonna have your back,
I'd want to know you'd have mine.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.559
I'll do whatever it takes.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.064
Let's talk at the next meeting.

36:33.941 --> 36:36.652
-All right. See you there.
-Yeah, you will.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.280
[blows whistle]

36:39.363 --> 36:40.740
Let's go, line up.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.376
I fixed the lock.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.216
-What are you doing?
-Hungry?

36:59.258 --> 37:00.968
I mean, yeah, always, but…

37:01.844 --> 37:05.181
We're having citrus-braised lamb shanks.

37:06.933 --> 37:07.767
Uh…

37:09.060 --> 37:11.938
What, ah… What happened with Angela?

37:13.773 --> 37:16.025
She's not really roommate material.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.443
[Annie] Oh.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.239
Was she a clean freak or something?

37:23.282 --> 37:26.661
You see that episode of <i>Hoarders</i>
with the woman who kept dead cats?

37:27.328 --> 37:30.331
Of course. That's Angela?

37:30.414 --> 37:33.918
Yeah, but instead of dead cats,
it was rotisserie chickens.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.879
She would eat off them for weeks.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.424
They were all over the place.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.929
You like mint jelly with lamb?

37:45.846 --> 37:47.723
-No.
-Good.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.852
So… why did you leave?

37:55.189 --> 37:56.816
Isn't that what you wanted?

37:57.942 --> 38:02.822
I mean, why else would you
do something this crazy?

38:07.243 --> 38:08.411
Are you mad?

38:09.620 --> 38:13.249
I was, at first. But…

38:14.917 --> 38:17.128
then I thought about it…

38:19.505 --> 38:23.134
and no one's ever really needed me before.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.224
No one's ever needed me either.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.190
Oh. Um…

38:39.483 --> 38:41.986
-You got any cumin?
-Uh…

38:44.238 --> 38:47.116
Does taco seasoning count?

38:49.201 --> 38:50.453
That's close enough.

38:52.413 --> 38:55.207
Also, it's so nice to have my bucket back.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.335
Thank you.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.589
[Nick] <i>This is older than me.</i>

39:01.672 --> 39:04.675
Well, I figure it's what
fancy politicians drink.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.260
Thank you.

39:06.886 --> 39:12.141
So, how does it feel
being tax ID number 49-3451299?

39:13.059 --> 39:15.353
-Overwhelming.
-[chuckles] Why is that?

39:15.436 --> 39:17.605
There's a lot more people to answer to.

39:17.688 --> 39:20.608
Based on the other night,
I think you handled it pretty well.

39:21.567 --> 39:23.819
-What was the vote?
-Four-three.

39:25.613 --> 39:28.324
-Close.
-There's always someone to convince.

39:29.283 --> 39:30.785
Not if you had my vote.

39:31.994 --> 39:32.995
Serious?

39:33.579 --> 39:35.748
Think a strip club owner has a shot?

39:35.831 --> 39:36.999
[laughs]

39:37.083 --> 39:40.419
-You're of the people.
-I'll need lots of advice.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.049
What changed your mind?

40:12.535 --> 40:13.452
You.

40:15.871 --> 40:17.123
Wait! Beth.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.126
Let's crack this open.

40:20.209 --> 40:22.294
Ah, I haven't earned it yet.

40:22.378 --> 40:26.215
-You're gonna win.
-Share it with someone who already has.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.611
Pour that out.
