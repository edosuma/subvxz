01:36.830 --> 01:39.185
Akelei. Akelei.

02:19.790 --> 02:22.224
Claire?

02:28.270 --> 02:31.307
- Move up.
- Thank you.

02:39.590 --> 02:43.185
Roast mules go topsy-turvy.

02:43.310 --> 02:46.427
Ten letters ending in "T."

02:46.550 --> 02:48.939
- I'm hopeless at this.
- Me too.

02:49.070 --> 02:51.903
"Somersault. "

02:53.830 --> 02:55.309
Bletchley.

03:06.990 --> 03:08.901
It's a walk.

03:09.030 --> 03:11.180
I know.

03:11.310 --> 03:13.778
I've been here before.

03:16.510 --> 03:18.387
This bus for Yardley...

03:21.430 --> 03:23.307
This bus for...

03:43.750 --> 03:48.141
Hello? Yes.
I'll try that extension for you.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.386
Please hold the line.

03:50.510 --> 03:53.661
I'm just putting you through.

03:53.790 --> 03:56.224
Yes, you're through.

03:56.350 --> 03:58.227
- Mr Skynner?
- Come in.

03:58.350 --> 04:00.580
It's been a pleasure, sir.

04:01.710 --> 04:04.178
I never wanted you back.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.505
Logie says he needs you.

04:08.110 --> 04:11.147
Well...

04:11.270 --> 04:13.465
he's got you.

04:14.910 --> 04:19.301
Conference in half an hour.
And keep your mouth shut.

04:19.430 --> 04:21.990
You're only there for show.

04:51.110 --> 04:54.785
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
You do look bloody terrible.

04:58.310 --> 05:02.462
- We missed you, Tom.
- I know why you want me back, Guy.

05:02.590 --> 05:05.866
You've lost the crown jewels,
haven't you? You've lost Shark.

05:08.390 --> 05:11.905
We got a call from one of the
intercept stations in Scarborough.

05:12.030 --> 05:15.340
And they started picking up a single
word broadcast on the hour, every hour...

05:15.470 --> 05:17.745
coming out of U-boat headquarters
in Sainte-Assise.

05:17.870 --> 05:20.430
- In Morse?
- No, it was a human voice.

05:20.550 --> 05:22.666
- "Akelei. "
- Meaning what?

05:22.790 --> 05:26.100
- It's a flower.
- I know it's a bloody flower, Guy.

05:26.230 --> 05:29.620
Aquilegia. Columbine.
But what did it mean?

05:29.750 --> 05:33.140
It meant,
"Change the weather code. "

05:33.270 --> 05:37.502
The Germans have switched their U-boats to
a new code book, and we're blacked out again.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.905
Is that why the Yanks are here?

05:40.030 --> 05:42.021
Skynner's in a panic.

05:42.150 --> 05:44.903
They want to take over his empire.

05:46.190 --> 05:48.340
Here comes our team.

05:54.870 --> 05:59.307
- You! You!
- Hello.

06:00.430 --> 06:04.059
- You in the Royal Navy?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:04.190 --> 06:07.387
- Only for a day or two. I mean, actually on a ship.
- What was your ship?

06:07.510 --> 06:11.344
Look, I can't be expected
to remember every little thing.

06:11.470 --> 06:14.109
Sorry.

06:14.230 --> 06:17.620
Welcome to Bletchley Park, sir.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.139
Three convoys left New York
in the past week...

06:20.270 --> 06:22.943
and are presently at sea.

06:23.070 --> 06:25.140
Convoy SC 122.

06:25.270 --> 06:28.945
Fifty merchant ships
carrying fuel oil, tanks...

06:29.070 --> 06:33.746
iron ore, bauxite,
also meat, sugar and wheat.

06:33.870 --> 06:36.942
Convoy HX 229 departed
New York on Monday.

06:37.070 --> 06:40.346
Forty merchant vessels
carrying explosives, manganese...

06:40.470 --> 06:42.984
timber, powdered milk.

06:43.110 --> 06:46.546
Convoy 229-A left New York
on Tuesday...

06:46.670 --> 06:49.742
carrying steel, timber,
powdered milk.

06:49.870 --> 06:52.145
I don't want a shopping list.
What's the total?

06:52.270 --> 06:55.819
One hundred and forty-one merchant ships,
gross tonnage just under a million tons.

06:55.950 --> 06:59.022
- Plus cargo of another million.
- And where are the U-boats?

07:01.550 --> 07:04.622
A submarine tracking rumour
had three U-boat packs operational...

07:04.750 --> 07:08.379
in the North Atlantic
as of OO hundred Thursday...

07:08.510 --> 07:11.263
here, here and here.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.382
Midnight Wednesday?

07:14.510 --> 07:17.820
- So where are the U-boats now?
- I'm afraid I have no idea.

07:19.430 --> 07:24.140
I thought that was why we were here.
Our intelligence has been shut off.

07:24.270 --> 07:27.342
You're telling us that the largest
assembly of merchant shipping...

07:27.470 --> 07:29.506
we've ever sent
across the North Atlantic...

07:29.630 --> 07:32.508
is now steaming towards
the largest concentration of U-boats...

07:32.630 --> 07:35.349
the Germans have ever put
in the North Atlantic...

07:35.470 --> 07:39.065
and you don't know where the hell
the goddam U-boats are?

07:39.190 --> 07:41.340
- Gentlemen, if I may...
- Shut up.

07:44.310 --> 07:46.824
What are our convoys making, hmm?

07:46.950 --> 07:49.145
Something over 220 miles a day.

07:50.750 --> 07:54.060
Well, I'd say we have
four days, maximum...

07:54.190 --> 07:58.786
before the convoys come in operational
range of where you last had the enemy.

07:58.910 --> 08:01.629
So, Leonard, this blackout...

08:01.750 --> 08:04.105
will it be over in four days?

08:04.230 --> 08:06.266
Uh, it's possible.

08:06.390 --> 08:08.540
Yes, well, all things are possible,
Leonard, but is it likely?

08:08.670 --> 08:12.379
Is it likely that you can break this
code, this, um... What'd you call this?

08:12.510 --> 08:16.139
This Shark? Before our convoys come
in range of the U-boats.

08:16.270 --> 08:19.899
- We'll give it every priority.
- Yes, I know damn well you'll give it every priority, Leonard.

08:20.030 --> 08:25.150
- That's not the question.
- Well, sir, as you press me, yes, I think we may be able to do it.

08:31.950 --> 08:34.304
Is that what you all believe?

08:34.429 --> 08:38.139
Um, well, I suppose you could say we know
more about Shark now than we did the last time.

08:38.270 --> 08:43.424
If Guy thinks we can do it,
I would certainly respect his opinion.

08:43.549 --> 08:46.667
And you?

08:46.790 --> 08:49.020
You don't seem
to have much to say.

08:49.150 --> 08:54.463
Tom Jericho. He's the one who got us into
reading Shark. If there's anyone alive...

08:54.590 --> 08:57.821
Can you break Shark again
in four days?

09:02.990 --> 09:05.982
Have you any idea
what you're talking about?

09:06.110 --> 09:09.147
Tom's been on sick leave for the last month,
so I don't think he's fully in the picture...

09:09.270 --> 09:12.342
Enigma is a very sophisticated
enciphering machine...

09:12.470 --> 09:15.030
and Shark
is its ultimate refinement...

09:15.150 --> 09:19.063
<i>so we're not talking
about The Times' crossword.</i>

09:20.350 --> 09:22.944
It weighs 26 pounds,
battery included...

09:23.070 --> 09:25.106
and goes anywhere.

09:25.230 --> 09:28.540
The Enigma machine.
The Germans have thousands of them.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.547
What's it do?

09:30.670 --> 09:33.343
It turns plain-text messages
into gobbledygook.

09:33.470 --> 09:36.109
Then the gobbledygook
gets transmitted in Morse.

09:36.230 --> 09:40.906
At the receiving end, there's another Enigma
machine to turn it back into the original message.

09:41.030 --> 09:44.067
Press the same key any number of times,
it will always come out different.

09:44.190 --> 09:47.944
- And you have one of your own.
- Courtesy of the Polish Cipher Bureau.

09:48.070 --> 09:51.142
So what's the problem?

09:51.270 --> 09:53.420
Problem?

09:53.550 --> 09:58.419
The problem is the machine has 115
million million million ways of doing it...

09:58.550 --> 10:02.304
according to how you set these three
rotors and how you connect these plugs.

10:02.430 --> 10:04.182
And that's Shark.

10:04.310 --> 10:07.302
No. No, no, no.
This is the one we can break.

10:07.430 --> 10:11.423
Shark is enciphered on a machine with a
fourth rotor specially developed for U-boats...

10:11.550 --> 10:16.180
which gives it about 4,OOO million
billion different starting positions.

10:17.710 --> 10:20.543
And, uh, we've never seen one.

10:20.670 --> 10:23.867
Holy shit!

10:23.990 --> 10:26.629
I haven't understood a word.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.822
Can somebody give me a straight answer
to a straight question?

10:29.950 --> 10:34.387
- Will this blackout definitely be over in...
- Nobody can say definitely, sir.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.182
Yes or no?

10:40.150 --> 10:44.348
- No.
- Thank you.

10:44.470 --> 10:49.544
So it isn't over in four days.
When will it be over, hmm?

10:49.670 --> 10:51.626
Hmm? Hmm? You.

10:54.030 --> 10:58.581
Well, all I have to measure it by is how long
it took last time when Shark first came in.

10:58.710 --> 11:01.907
- And how long did it take?
- Ten months.

11:03.550 --> 11:06.223
Well, this is a great day
for Adolf Hitler.

11:06.350 --> 11:08.500
Ten months?

11:08.630 --> 11:11.303
But you did break it?

11:11.430 --> 11:13.148
Yes.

11:13.270 --> 11:16.899
- How?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

11:24.030 --> 11:25.941
I think it's time we...

11:26.070 --> 11:29.107
I think it's time
I got back to London.

11:43.870 --> 11:48.102
It's not just a million tons of shipping.
It's a million tons of shipping every week!

11:48.230 --> 11:51.825
It's our capability to supply Russia,
to support the army in North Africa...

11:51.950 --> 11:54.145
to invade Europe
and drive the Germans out.

11:54.270 --> 11:57.626
- It's the whole fucking war.
- Sir.

12:04.790 --> 12:10.183
Satisfied? Now, send the stupid bugger
back to where he came from.

12:15.510 --> 12:17.546
Don't waste a match.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.827
Back to Mayfair?

12:22.950 --> 12:24.827
No.

12:25.990 --> 12:28.550
How many people knew
about the German weather code...

12:28.670 --> 12:30.820
how important it was to us?

12:30.950 --> 12:33.100
A dozen, maybe. Why?

12:33.230 --> 12:35.505
Make me a little list?

12:36.950 --> 12:39.145
What are you doing here,
Mr Wigram?

12:39.270 --> 12:42.023
You think there's a spy
in Bletchley Park?

12:45.950 --> 12:49.499
I'm Cave.
Naval Intelligence.

12:49.630 --> 12:53.782
I'll be liaising with the admiralty.
They've given me an office in your hut.

12:56.550 --> 12:59.018
I'm ultra-cleared.

12:59.150 --> 13:02.506
- What does that mean?
- That means I know how you broke Shark, in principle.

13:02.630 --> 13:05.747
You used a captured copy
of the German Navy's weather code book.

13:05.870 --> 13:09.260
Gave you a pretty good idea of what their
weather signals were supposed to be saying.

13:09.390 --> 13:11.267
Can I see it?

13:13.070 --> 13:16.380
Midnight, two days ago,
the Germans changed to a new book.

13:16.510 --> 13:21.948
- So we lost that crib.
- Well, why do you think they did that just then?

13:22.070 --> 13:24.584
Don't know.

13:24.710 --> 13:26.621
And the other one?

13:26.750 --> 13:29.105
Short signal code book.

13:29.230 --> 13:32.859
The U-boats employ it for reporting
their position, course and speed.

13:32.990 --> 13:36.300
Unfortunately, if you don't know where
the U-boat is or what it's doing...

13:36.430 --> 13:39.547
the short signal code book
isn't much help as a crib.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.619
Two men died
saving those little books...

13:47.750 --> 13:50.708
from a sinking submarine.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.025
Fasson and Grazier.

13:54.670 --> 13:57.946
We caught the U-boat
on the surface in the eastern Med.

14:01.150 --> 14:05.541
The sub went down when they were inside
trying to bring out its four-rotor Enigma.

14:08.710 --> 14:11.941
November '42.
I was in destroyers.

14:12.070 --> 14:14.789
It was my last ship.

14:16.510 --> 14:20.298
Bletchley is the lucky number
in this war.

14:20.510 --> 14:23.149
- One and six, please.
- One and six.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.378
Here you are.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.501
Girls, guess I'm off.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.224
- See you later.
- Yes, I'll see you later.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.949
Miss Wallace?

14:56.070 --> 14:59.028
Mr Jericho.
When did you get back?

14:59.150 --> 15:03.268
Just today.
How, uh... How are you?

15:04.710 --> 15:06.541
How am I?

15:06.670 --> 15:09.867
Yeah, all right.
How is she?

15:09.990 --> 15:12.982
She's... She's Claire.

15:15.310 --> 15:18.541
- Well, will you tell her?
- If I see her.

15:18.670 --> 15:21.628
She hasn't been sleeping
at home the last two nights.

15:23.110 --> 15:25.578
Sorry.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.218
Good morning, sir.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.822
- Worrying about your babies?
- Puck.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.908
Thomas.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.464
So, they say you're
not crazy any more.

16:00.950 --> 16:03.066
- It thinks it's found a possible.
- "It thinks"?

16:03.190 --> 16:06.546
- Why not?
- Been in the hut?

16:06.670 --> 16:09.468
- Come on. Get it over with.
- No, I'm fine, Puck.

16:09.590 --> 16:11.467
Sure, you are.

16:12.910 --> 16:15.185
Hey, Betty, wait for me!

16:17.390 --> 16:20.109
Gentlemen, we have a ghost.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.107
Tom, how the hell are you?

16:22.230 --> 16:24.221
- Well. Very well.
- Have you escaped, or what?

16:24.350 --> 16:26.466
- I thought this was the asylum.
- How are you?

16:26.590 --> 16:28.626
- Good.
- Bloody hell!

16:28.750 --> 16:31.548
- How's the revolution, Alec?
- Coming along, comrade. Coming along.

16:31.670 --> 16:34.787
- T... T... T...
- Yes, it's me.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.629
I, uh... I want to see all the Shark
traffic we haven't been able to break.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.906
- In at the deep end.
- Why not?

16:44.030 --> 16:46.988
- Yes, why not?
- Have you got yesterday's Porpoises?

16:47.110 --> 16:49.749
Open the file.

16:49.870 --> 16:53.909
Besides, it wasn't really Shark
that made you crazy.

16:54.030 --> 16:56.225
Was it, Tom?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.218
I suppose you all know.

17:00.350 --> 17:03.786
You think I made a fool of myself?

17:03.910 --> 17:05.980
Forget about it.
You're among friends.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.025
So, what about the code breakers?

17:12.150 --> 17:17.178
Kingcome, De Brooke,
Upjohn, Pukowski.

17:17.310 --> 17:21.541
- Spot the odd one out.
- Puck lost his parents when Poland was invaded.

17:21.670 --> 17:25.549
His kid brother is missing in action.
He hates the Germans.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.140
Pinker?
Bit of an arty, isn't he?

17:29.270 --> 17:31.340
He writes detective stories.

17:31.470 --> 17:34.542
Baxter. They say he sleeps with
a picture of Stalin under his pillow.

17:34.670 --> 17:36.740
Perhaps you haven't heard.
Stalirs on our side now.

17:36.870 --> 17:40.749
- And Jericho. The famous Mr Jericho.
- Mathematician.

17:40.870 --> 17:45.580
Went off his trolley, didn't he?
About some girl.

17:45.710 --> 17:48.349
We took him out of Cambridge
on the first day of the war.

17:48.470 --> 17:52.986
He worked himself into a breakdown, so we
shipped him back to Cambridge to get well.

17:53.110 --> 17:55.624
And that's all there is to it.

17:55.750 --> 17:58.947
It's never all there is
to anything.

18:01.070 --> 18:03.823
Shift's not over yet, ladies!

18:03.950 --> 18:07.420
The 3:OO's from Beaumanor
all need blisting.

18:12.070 --> 18:16.029
You know, without your glasses,
you don't look half bad.

18:16.150 --> 18:19.426
Do you know, without my glasses,
nor do you?

19:36.070 --> 19:38.504
Claire?

19:38.630 --> 19:40.780
I'm here.

19:41.950 --> 19:44.100
Sorry it took an age.

19:44.230 --> 19:46.221
Well, now you know where I am.

19:46.350 --> 19:50.263
It's, um, off the beaten track.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.063
Yes, well, it's better
than being snooped on by landladies.

19:53.190 --> 19:55.750
Welfare found out I had a spare room,
so I had to share.

19:55.870 --> 19:59.909
But Hester's a sweetie, really. Oh, there's
no sugar, I'm afraid, but it's lapsang.

20:00.030 --> 20:03.466
And I always think sugar would
rather spoil lapsang, don't you?

20:03.590 --> 20:07.139
Don't know.
You're my first lapsang.

20:08.630 --> 20:11.622
I knew you'd ask me out.

20:11.750 --> 20:16.870
- I thought you asked me out.
- Well, I had to get you started. Arert there any pretty girls in Hut 8?

20:16.990 --> 20:21.188
- How do you know where I work?
- We've got an interesting men tracking room in Hut 3.

20:21.310 --> 20:24.666
- You're not supposed to tell me where you...
- Besides, you're rumoured to have done something very clever...

20:24.790 --> 20:27.304
and I want to know what it is.

20:27.430 --> 20:30.149
Oh, my God.
Where did they find you?

20:30.270 --> 20:33.342
Oh, where did they find any of us?
I'm the lucky one.

20:33.470 --> 20:36.701
You know, they've got perfectly clever
girls working like post office clerks.

20:36.830 --> 20:39.947
Not like me
on the German book.

20:40.070 --> 20:41.981
I want that for my scrapbook.

20:45.190 --> 20:48.307
- Can I see it?
- If you want. It's upstairs.

20:51.470 --> 20:53.381
That's Hester.

20:56.550 --> 20:58.905
And this is me.

21:08.070 --> 21:10.459
You've been busy.

21:10.590 --> 21:15.744
- Where is this?
- Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where I'd like to be old.

21:15.870 --> 21:19.658
If I'm ever old.
Do you think it's beautiful?

22:02.270 --> 22:06.149
Why are you a mathematician?
Do you like sums?

22:07.750 --> 22:10.389
I like numbers.

22:10.510 --> 22:14.469
Because with numbers,
truth and beauty are the same thing.

22:14.590 --> 22:18.629
You know you're getting somewhere
when the equations start looking...

22:18.750 --> 22:21.503
beautiful.

22:21.630 --> 22:25.703
And you know the numbers are taking you
closer to the secret of how things are.

22:27.790 --> 22:31.339
A rose is just plain text.

24:00.310 --> 24:03.939
My God.
What have you done?

24:04.070 --> 24:06.220
What has she done?

24:06.350 --> 24:09.103
- Mr Jericho?
- Miss Wallace.

24:09.230 --> 24:13.189
I came looking for Claire.
I was worried about her.

24:14.430 --> 24:16.660
I could fill a bus with men
who are worried about Claire Romilly...

24:16.790 --> 24:19.258
but that's no reason why
I shouldn't go to the police.

24:19.390 --> 24:22.780
She'd be the first person
they'd arrest.

24:25.350 --> 24:27.705
Miss Wallace,
please put that poker down.

24:27.830 --> 24:31.220
And if you know where she is,
for God's sake, tell me.

24:35.510 --> 24:37.466
She's gone missing.

24:39.470 --> 24:41.347
What are those, exactly?

24:43.150 --> 24:46.028
Intercepts. German signals.

24:46.150 --> 24:48.869
Yes, I know that much.

24:48.990 --> 24:52.744
Five-letter groups. German Navy signals
are sent in four-letter groups.

24:52.870 --> 24:55.543
So this must be army
or Luftwaffe.

24:55.670 --> 24:57.547
Picked up by the radio scanners
at Beaumanor.

24:57.670 --> 25:02.790
All sent between 9:30 and midnight
on April 17, nine days ago.

25:02.910 --> 25:07.108
- But never deciphered.
- How do you know that?

25:07.230 --> 25:10.905
Well, if it'd gone through the machine,
then plain text would be stuck on the back.

25:11.030 --> 25:14.500
All from the same source.
"ADU. ADU."

25:14.630 --> 25:17.747
Does the call sign ADU
mean anything to you, Miss Wallace?

25:20.030 --> 25:22.100
Miss Wallace?

25:24.350 --> 25:26.227
"Angels Dance Upwards. "

25:26.350 --> 25:28.227
- What?
- Well, that's how we'd reference it.

25:28.350 --> 25:32.184
- Who is it? Who is ADU?
- I don't know.

25:32.310 --> 25:35.382
But you could find out.

25:35.510 --> 25:38.786
Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

25:38.910 --> 25:43.540
We can't just go digging through Bletchley
looking for information about missing cryptograms.

25:43.670 --> 25:47.583
If we want to find Claire, then we need
to find out what she was hiding.

25:49.510 --> 25:52.229
- You think Claire is a traitor.
- Would it matter if she were?

25:53.510 --> 25:56.070
Of course it matters.
Look...

25:56.190 --> 25:59.944
she was probably flirting with an officer
and forgot to file those intercepts...

26:00.070 --> 26:02.538
so she hid them
rather than get told off.

26:02.670 --> 26:05.468
Or she stole them
and then she ran away.

26:07.310 --> 26:09.301
You really are mad,
aren't you?

26:09.430 --> 26:14.299
And I would have to be even madder to have any
part in this little amateur sleuthing adventure.

26:14.430 --> 26:17.547
Miss Wallace.
Miss Wallace!

26:17.670 --> 26:20.343
You said yourself
that she was missing.

26:20.470 --> 26:24.588
Now, is that normal?
Is that her habit?

26:24.710 --> 26:29.181
Well, she does always come home
to change her clothes.

26:29.310 --> 26:31.460
Well, there you are.

26:34.550 --> 26:37.189
Is she seeing anyone,
do you know?

26:38.550 --> 26:40.939
What exactly is your interest here?

26:42.550 --> 26:46.145
You can reach me at Armstrong's
Guest House in Albion Street.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.900
ADU, Miss Wallace.

26:53.030 --> 26:55.828
Angels Dance Upwards.

27:03.070 --> 27:05.823
<i>They call it Black Bottom
the new twister</i>

27:05.950 --> 27:07.941
<i>It's sure got 'em
and, oh, sister</i>

27:08.070 --> 27:12.348
<i>They clap their hands
and do a raggedy flop and a hop</i>

27:12.470 --> 27:14.540
<i>Old fellows with lumbago</i>

27:14.670 --> 27:16.740
<i>And high yellow
The waves they go</i>

27:16.870 --> 27:20.180
<i>They jump right in
and give us all that they've got</i>

27:20.310 --> 27:24.906
<i>They say that when that river bottom's
covered with ooze</i>

27:29.510 --> 27:32.547
You silly, silly girl.

27:39.310 --> 27:41.301
These people keep
such funny hours.

27:41.430 --> 27:44.786
I haven't heard...
Oh, Mr Jericho!

27:44.910 --> 27:49.028
You have a visitor.
You can have the parlour.

27:51.150 --> 27:53.903
We don't have guests
in the bedrooms after 1 O: OO.

27:54.030 --> 27:56.624
Oh, Mrs Armstrong, it's perfectly
sweet of you to worry...

27:56.750 --> 27:59.548
but I don't mind taking
the risk just this once.

27:59.670 --> 28:04.300
Well, I suppose it's all right
if you're from the park.

28:07.870 --> 28:12.148
Mr Wigram, would you care
for a cup of Ovaltine?

28:12.270 --> 28:14.067
Ovaltine?

28:14.190 --> 28:16.704
I haven't had Ovaltine since...
no, no...

28:16.830 --> 28:19.867
Ovaltine. Thank you.
I don't think my system could take it.

28:21.790 --> 28:23.587
What a charming house.

28:23.710 --> 28:28.181
And hunting prints.
Do you hunt?

28:37.430 --> 28:39.990
Where are you based?
Here?

28:44.110 --> 28:45.987
Bliss.

28:47.750 --> 28:50.503
What can I do for you,
Mr, um, Wigram?

28:50.630 --> 28:54.179
There's something
I've been wondering about.

28:54.310 --> 28:56.949
You're the man
who broke the U-boat code.

28:57.070 --> 29:00.028
Hmm?
Champagne all around.

29:00.150 --> 29:03.825
Happy days are here again,
all right?

29:03.950 --> 29:06.145
Then you fell out of your pram.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.581
So what happened?

29:09.710 --> 29:11.701
It was personal.

29:11.830 --> 29:13.946
I can keep a secret.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.980
Wonderful thing about war...

29:21.550 --> 29:24.542
Peacetime is about keeping
the people in their place.

29:24.670 --> 29:29.346
But then war breaks out,
and life was never so glorious.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.823
The toiling masses
turn into heroes...

29:33.950 --> 29:37.226
and their little women start dropping
their drawers like debutantes.

29:37.350 --> 29:40.786
- Well, if that's all you...
- And best of all, the swots.

29:40.910 --> 29:44.585
Dragged out in a cloud of dandruff
from some dim backwater...

29:44.710 --> 29:47.349
and invited to the ball.

29:47.470 --> 29:51.907
At Bletchley, you're as glamorous
as fighter pilots.

29:52.030 --> 29:54.146
Girls you couldn't even hope to meet
go weak at the knees...

29:54.270 --> 29:57.546
at the thought of the size
of your brain, isn't that right?

29:57.670 --> 30:00.628
If talking through your arse
is what they teach you in spy school...

30:00.750 --> 30:03.787
I'm talking about you
and a girl called Claire Romilly.

30:05.110 --> 30:06.987
We're rather worried about her.

30:07.110 --> 30:12.264
Officially been missing for 14 hours, give or
take. When in fact, it's more like 48 hours.

30:12.390 --> 30:15.666
She hasn't been seen
since she went off-duty on Thursday.

30:17.950 --> 30:21.579
Rather a good friend
of yours, I gather.

30:23.070 --> 30:25.743
L- I haven't seen her since befo...
since before I...

30:25.870 --> 30:28.907
Quite.
Heard from her?

30:30.110 --> 30:33.580
- No.
- Apart from the postcard.

30:35.350 --> 30:37.705
Let's try to remember everything.

30:37.830 --> 30:40.139
It saves misunderstandings.

30:44.430 --> 30:48.105
Did you go to the cottage tonight?
Don't think about it.

30:48.230 --> 30:49.982
- Yes.
- Yes.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.021
Yes.

30:55.630 --> 30:58.064
Mind if I sit down?

30:58.190 --> 31:01.626
I've been away for a month.
I wanted to look her up.

31:01.750 --> 31:04.947
You ever discuss
your work with her?

31:05.070 --> 31:09.666
- Of course not.
- Um, how about a gun?

31:09.790 --> 31:11.940
- Any guns?
- A gun?

31:12.070 --> 31:15.221
A gun from that museum of yours...

31:15.350 --> 31:19.389
liberated from a captured U-boat along with the code
books, the captairs teddy bear and what have you.

31:19.510 --> 31:22.980
All very improper and unsigned for,
but I turned a blind eye.

31:23.110 --> 31:26.580
But no reason why you should know,
a chap like you.

31:30.270 --> 31:32.738
Mind if I check the coat?

31:52.230 --> 31:55.586
While we're at it...

32:05.790 --> 32:08.020
- You sure you don't mind?
- I'm beginning to.

32:12.630 --> 32:14.541
You see my point, though,
don't you?

32:14.670 --> 32:18.549
One day the Germans black us out
in the North Atlantic.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.946
Next day, girlfriend
of crack code breaker disappears...

32:22.070 --> 32:24.379
vanishes.

32:24.510 --> 32:28.742
- Code breaker returns, shiny new shooter goes missing.
- She's not my girlfriend.

32:28.870 --> 32:32.101
Hmm? What is she, then?

32:32.230 --> 32:35.427
We were... I suppose the phrase is
"seeing each other"...

32:35.550 --> 32:37.825
for about a month.

32:39.630 --> 32:42.269
Is that what happened to you?

32:42.390 --> 32:44.267
What?

32:44.390 --> 32:47.985
Is Claire Romilly
what happened to you?

32:56.990 --> 32:59.185
There was a concert.

33:01.270 --> 33:03.579
I went on my own.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.549
Oh, it's you.
You found my slipper.

33:33.470 --> 33:37.827
Afterwards, Claire, Hester...
Miss Wallace, who shares the cottage...

33:37.950 --> 33:40.623
and I, we came out together.

33:40.750 --> 33:42.741
Next week was going to be Bach.

33:42.870 --> 33:44.747
Oh, we must go.

33:44.870 --> 33:47.430
Oh, I can't.
I'm on the night shift.

33:47.550 --> 33:49.541
Oh, Hester. Poor you.

33:49.670 --> 33:52.821
"Poor you," she said.
That's one of her phrases.

33:52.950 --> 33:55.623
So, I asked her.

33:55.750 --> 34:00.062
I say, I hope you don't think it
fresh of me, but should we go together?

34:00.190 --> 34:05.867
Of course you did.
And, uh, after that?

34:05.990 --> 34:08.550
After that?

34:08.670 --> 34:11.581
I had the happiest month
of my whole life.

34:11.710 --> 34:14.349
Not happiest. Something.

34:19.230 --> 34:22.141
- You can! You can.
- I can't.

34:22.270 --> 34:25.148
You can. Yes.

34:25.270 --> 34:29.228
Ready? One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

34:30.710 --> 34:34.668
- Sorry.
- No, you can't.

34:34.790 --> 34:36.985
- Claire!
- Aaron!

34:37.110 --> 34:39.101
- May I?
- Do you mind?

34:39.230 --> 34:41.824
No.

34:54.830 --> 34:56.706
It's my favourite club.

34:56.830 --> 35:00.789
- Mine too.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure.

35:00.910 --> 35:03.424
How do you get the petrol coupons to go
zipping up and down to London?

35:03.550 --> 35:07.259
Secret, darling.
I know a chap.

35:07.390 --> 35:10.587
- No, but how?
- It's not what you think.

35:10.710 --> 35:12.587
Do you have to know everything?

35:12.710 --> 35:15.668
I don't know why you want me.
Let's get married before it stops.

35:15.790 --> 35:19.544
- Tom, don't.
- I love you!

35:19.670 --> 35:22.343
They say you shouldn't fall in love
in a war. You never know what's coming.

35:24.150 --> 35:28.223
I love you.
I really love you.

35:46.390 --> 35:48.665
No cottage.

35:48.790 --> 35:51.429
- Is that code, darling?
- Yes.

35:51.550 --> 35:54.701
- I want to see where you sleep.
- Landlady has rules.

35:54.830 --> 35:57.822
So have I.
Hester's at home.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.827
Oh.

35:59.950 --> 36:02.942
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
Promise.

36:05.750 --> 36:07.627
Shh. Shh.

36:19.190 --> 36:21.750
Sleep with her?

36:22.870 --> 36:25.179
I'll take that as a yes.

36:26.790 --> 36:29.099
And then you quarrelled?

36:29.230 --> 36:32.540
Quarrelled? No.

36:34.870 --> 36:37.668
Claire? Darling?

36:40.470 --> 36:43.143
Sorry, darling.

36:43.270 --> 36:45.147
Go back to sleep.

36:46.630 --> 36:51.340
- What are you doing?
- I'm just looking through your things.

36:51.470 --> 36:54.143
No photographs?

36:54.270 --> 36:56.738
You've never given me
a photograph.

37:02.070 --> 37:04.265
You're all secrets,
aren't you?

37:04.390 --> 37:06.858
I've no secrets from you.
Please come back to bed.

37:12.750 --> 37:17.949
What's this? What's the
entscheidungsproblem when it's at home?

37:18.070 --> 37:20.220
That's just something
I was working on at Cambridge.

37:20.350 --> 37:22.989
It's a... It's a theoretical
machine that...

37:23.110 --> 37:27.501
- Theoretical. So it doesn't exist?
- Please, come back to bed.

37:27.630 --> 37:31.384
Well, this will do.
I want something of yours to keep.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.466
Give it back.

37:33.590 --> 37:37.822
- Why?
- Because it means nothing to you and a lot to me.

37:37.950 --> 37:41.067
- Arert I clever enough, darling?
- Please, Claire!

37:41.190 --> 37:43.988
No!

37:44.110 --> 37:46.180
Give it back.
Give it back.

37:55.430 --> 37:57.546
It's not funny, Claire!

38:08.630 --> 38:11.144
Claire, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

38:11.270 --> 38:13.989
I'm really, really sorry.

38:15.310 --> 38:17.028
Claire...

38:17.150 --> 38:19.789
She moved on.

38:19.910 --> 38:22.743
Why won't you answer my letters?

38:24.830 --> 38:29.824
Are you seeing someone else?

38:29.950 --> 38:32.748
I'm always seeing someone else.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.741
Yes.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.510
She moved on.

38:42.830 --> 38:45.060
Not right, Mr Jericho.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.345
Can't quite put my finger on it...

38:49.470 --> 38:53.622
but definitely not right.

39:00.870 --> 39:04.146
Were you surprised when they told you
that Admiral Doenitz...

39:04.270 --> 39:06.340
had changed the German Navy
weather code?

39:06.470 --> 39:09.030
Any bells go off?

39:09.150 --> 39:11.106
Germans were always nervous
about Enigma.

39:11.230 --> 39:14.142
Well, the Germans are supposed to think
that Enigma's an unbreakable system...

39:14.270 --> 39:17.342
because it would take thousands of years
to go through every setting...

39:17.470 --> 39:20.746
to find the one that turns
the code back into the plain text.

39:20.870 --> 39:24.988
Next day, it's different again. Using
human beings, Enigma is safe forever...

39:25.110 --> 39:28.102
but we don't use
human beings for that.

39:30.470 --> 39:32.062
Do we...

39:32.190 --> 39:35.023
Mr Jericho?

39:35.150 --> 39:37.903
- No.
- No.

39:38.030 --> 39:40.544
And that is the secret
inside the secret.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.821
All they know thus far is that the weather
code opened a crack in the system...

39:43.950 --> 39:46.748
because somebody told them.

39:48.830 --> 39:53.346
But what if somebody tells them
just how we do do it?

39:53.470 --> 39:57.986
Your thinking machine.
Clackety-clack, day and night.

39:58.110 --> 40:00.943
Programmed with a menu,
thanks to your big brain...

40:01.070 --> 40:03.584
that reduces the odds
to just a few million to one...

40:03.710 --> 40:05.940
till it locks on to
the winning combination.

40:07.990 --> 40:10.106
There goes the war.

40:14.430 --> 40:16.898
Oh.

40:17.030 --> 40:19.828
I've got a little list.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.100
You're on it.

40:22.230 --> 40:26.428
Communists, foreign nationals...

40:26.550 --> 40:29.269
geniuses just this side
of barking mad.

40:29.390 --> 40:31.346
Altogether, a security nightmare.

40:31.470 --> 40:35.748
But of all these names, Mr Jericho,
you are the only one...

40:35.870 --> 40:41.308
who got himself fucked into
a nervous breakdown by a missing blonde.

40:41.430 --> 40:43.898
You live quietly from now on.

40:50.870 --> 40:53.384
Where does one pee around here?

40:53.510 --> 40:55.785
To the right.

41:29.430 --> 41:32.342
Good night, Mrs Armstrong.

41:45.470 --> 41:48.906
Talk to me!
What do you want to know?

41:50.030 --> 41:52.498
Do you want to know about Shark?
Do you want to know about Shark?

41:52.630 --> 41:56.179
Any secret. Ask me.
Ask me! I'll tell you!

41:56.310 --> 42:00.144
Poor you. I really got
under your skin, didn't I?

42:10.950 --> 42:12.827
Good morning.

42:12.950 --> 42:15.020
- Good morning.
- You look tired, sir.

42:15.150 --> 42:17.027
Morning!

42:24.910 --> 42:26.468
- Have you heard the latest?
- No.

42:26.590 --> 42:29.741
Utility knickers...
one Yank, and they're off.

42:29.870 --> 42:31.986
Naughty, naughty.

42:35.510 --> 42:40.265
<i>- Came through the door for you.
- If there is some other way</i>

42:40.390 --> 42:43.063
<i>To prove that I love you</i>

42:43.190 --> 42:47.706
<i>I swear I don't know how</i>

42:54.670 --> 42:57.946
Preserve my body and soul
into everlasting peace.

42:58.070 --> 43:02.268
Take and eat this in remembrance
that Christ died for you.

43:02.390 --> 43:04.745
Thank you for your note.

43:04.870 --> 43:09.261
I take it it's about Claire.
Have you heard anything?

43:09.390 --> 43:11.950
She hasn't turned up,
if that's what you mean.

43:12.070 --> 43:15.699
- But you've got something.
- Take this and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for you.

43:15.830 --> 43:17.821
I don't know why I'm doing this.

43:21.470 --> 43:24.746
The body of our Lord,
Jesus Christ, which was given freely.

43:24.870 --> 43:26.747
Preserve my body and soul...

43:26.870 --> 43:31.864
<i>ADU is the call sign
of Nachtrichten, Regiment 537...</i>

43:31.990 --> 43:34.550
a motorized German
Army signals unit based...

43:34.670 --> 43:36.786
in the Ukraine.

43:45.230 --> 43:49.826
Its messages are encoded in the standard
cipher for the Russian campaign.

43:49.950 --> 43:53.863
- We call it Kestrel.
- Kestrel.

44:05.870 --> 44:07.940
Seven messages
with the call sign ADU...

44:08.070 --> 44:10.630
were intercepted
in March and April...

44:10.750 --> 44:15.221
not counting the last four
on April the 17th, which you found.

44:15.350 --> 44:19.263
I've written down the dates
and times of interception.

44:27.270 --> 44:31.422
A spy doesn't steal the enemy's signals.
And anyway, they were never de...

44:31.550 --> 44:35.429
They were never decoded. Why would
she steal four messages she can't read?

44:35.550 --> 44:37.620
She must have stolen them
to read them.

44:37.750 --> 44:40.742
She stole them to read them.
But there's no way she could have.

44:40.870 --> 44:43.862
- Why not?
- She couldn't. It just...

44:43.990 --> 44:46.663
Just take my word for it.

44:46.790 --> 44:50.226
God preserve me.
Another one.

44:50.350 --> 44:53.262
I seem to move, Mr Jericho,
in an endless round...

44:53.390 --> 44:56.268
from one patronizing male
to another...

44:56.390 --> 44:59.302
forever being told what I am
and what I am not allowed to know.

44:59.430 --> 45:01.421
Well, that ends here.

45:03.630 --> 45:05.905
So, what would she need
to read them?

45:06.030 --> 45:09.147
I'm sorry.
You can't ask me that.

45:09.270 --> 45:12.740
But you can ask me to sneak into the Index
Room and risk getting hung up by my thumbs.

45:17.350 --> 45:20.262
- Good morning.
- Cheerio, then.

45:20.390 --> 45:22.779
Oh, Chr... Miss Wallace.

45:23.950 --> 45:26.510
Miss Wallace!

45:26.630 --> 45:29.463
She'd need...
She'd need a Typex machine.

45:31.430 --> 45:34.342
Every day, our Typex machines
have to be set...

45:34.470 --> 45:36.540
the same way the Germans
set their Enigmas.

45:36.670 --> 45:39.787
Otherwise, you just get
nonsense from nonsense.

45:41.070 --> 45:44.142
And working out each day's settings
is the hard part.

45:44.270 --> 45:46.738
That's where
the code breakers come in.

45:46.870 --> 45:51.819
- How?
- Well, you... you need a crib.

45:51.950 --> 45:54.783
- I'll see you later, then.
- Suppose that gravestone was in code.

45:54.910 --> 45:58.744
If I knew who was buried here, more
or less, I'd know what the code meant.

46:00.590 --> 46:02.467
That's a crib.

46:02.590 --> 46:05.946
And when you've set the machine,
you type in the coded message.

46:06.070 --> 46:08.743
If it comes out nonsense,
the settings are wrong.

46:08.870 --> 46:10.986
If it comes out
"Mary Jane Hawkins"...

46:11.110 --> 46:12.987
you've broken Enigma for that day.

46:15.070 --> 46:18.745
Why would Claire get hold of the
Kestrel settings for April the 17th?

46:18.870 --> 46:21.862
She couldn't have,
unless she had help.

46:21.990 --> 46:25.505
Kestrel would be filed in Hut 6.

46:25.630 --> 46:27.780
It's your hut.

46:29.310 --> 46:31.949
So now I'm a traitor too.

46:32.070 --> 46:37.064
Well, maybe she got access
to one of the Typex machines from you.

46:37.190 --> 46:40.387
Typex girls work around the clock.

46:40.510 --> 46:42.068
Sorry.

46:43.590 --> 46:45.467
Stuck.

46:46.950 --> 46:49.418
Look.

46:49.550 --> 46:52.622
The first seven ADUs were decoded.

46:52.750 --> 46:55.139
Now, what happens
to decoded messages?

46:55.270 --> 46:58.899
They get written into the German book.
That's Claire's job.

46:59.030 --> 47:00.941
Then what?

47:01.070 --> 47:04.062
Well, then they get filed with
everything else in the main registry.

47:04.190 --> 47:07.978
- Ever been in there?
- Once or twice to check some...

47:08.110 --> 47:11.261
No. No, no, no, no.

47:15.270 --> 47:18.342
Oh, dear, would you like some tea?

47:20.070 --> 47:21.947
- Reference or loan?
- Reference.

47:23.510 --> 47:25.865
- Section?
- Hut 6. Control.

47:29.430 --> 47:32.661
- What are they?
- Kestrel intercepts, March and April.

47:40.950 --> 47:45.228
- He's been a dark horse, hasn't he?
- Hmm. Surprise a minute.

47:45.350 --> 47:47.910
But there are complications.

47:48.030 --> 47:50.339
Sorry to have been so long.

47:50.470 --> 47:52.938
I've never come across this before.

47:54.750 --> 47:57.583
- The file was empty?
- There was a typewritten note...

47:57.710 --> 47:59.348
dated April the 17th...

47:59.470 --> 48:02.064
referring all inquiries
to the Office of the Director General.

48:02.190 --> 48:06.502
And that night, four final ADU
messages got in under the wire...

48:06.630 --> 48:09.098
never deciphered, never filed...

48:09.230 --> 48:11.460
taken home by Claire and hidden.

48:11.590 --> 48:13.899
Who is the Director General?

48:15.750 --> 48:18.218
Chief of the Special
Intelligence Service.

48:18.350 --> 48:21.979
And he gets his orders straight
from the prime minister.

48:23.630 --> 48:25.541
We're stuck again.

48:25.670 --> 48:28.503
Maybe. Maybe not.

48:31.550 --> 48:34.906
I've got the hang
of this detective work.

48:35.030 --> 48:38.022
<i>But I've been told
that everything's okay</i>

48:42.550 --> 48:44.745
You're out of bounds!

48:46.870 --> 48:49.543
- Mr Mermagen.
- What are you doing?

48:51.790 --> 48:53.940
Can you help me?

48:54.070 --> 48:57.301
Machine Room needs the Kestrel settings
for the last couple of weeks.

48:57.430 --> 49:00.979
They've found a batch of intercepts
fallen behind a desk.

49:01.110 --> 49:04.739
- They've done what?
- I know.

49:04.870 --> 49:09.022
But please don't tell.
It was actually a friend of mine.

49:10.470 --> 49:13.746
Ah, you girls.

49:19.830 --> 49:23.948
You know, I should really
report you for this...

49:24.070 --> 49:25.788
but...

49:27.470 --> 49:30.542
One good turn
deserves another, hmm?

49:30.670 --> 49:34.458
Why, Mr Mermagen.

49:35.990 --> 49:40.222
What will your wife say?

49:40.350 --> 49:44.548
The Kestrel settings
for the whole of March and April.

49:44.670 --> 49:46.467
Christ.

49:46.590 --> 49:50.663
So, at least there's still a chance we can
read the ones you found in Claire's bedroom.

49:50.790 --> 49:52.746
- I've burnt them.
- You what?

49:52.870 --> 49:54.906
Hello, Tom.
Mind if we join you?

49:55.030 --> 49:58.864
- You can't m-m-m-mean it.
- Well, of course I mean it.

49:58.990 --> 50:02.699
Drowning herself was Virginia Woolf's
greatest contribution to English literature.

50:02.830 --> 50:06.379
- Actually, we were just leaving.
- Waste not, want not.

50:06.510 --> 50:08.387
Whale meat.
Brain food, Tom.

50:08.510 --> 50:12.981
- You burned them!
- I had a close call with that lounge lizard Wigram from Special Intelligence.

50:13.110 --> 50:16.944
I panicked. But the worst of it is,
I could have read them.

50:17.070 --> 50:19.345
- How?
- I didn't need a Typex machine.

50:19.470 --> 50:21.984
We've got a real Enigma
in the museum.

50:22.110 --> 50:26.547
- Well, when did you find that out?
- Well, I knew. I just... I just forgot.

50:26.670 --> 50:29.104
You forgot?

50:29.230 --> 50:31.949
And you're the genius.

50:35.550 --> 50:38.542
You know, I won a newspaper
crossword competition.

50:38.670 --> 50:42.982
I beat two men. All three of us
were recruited for Bletchley.

50:43.110 --> 50:45.146
They're cryptanalysts now.

50:45.270 --> 50:47.909
And I'm a glorified file clerk.

50:48.030 --> 50:52.228
'Course, if I'd been a daddy's girl
from some posh finishing school...

50:52.350 --> 50:55.786
God, look, it's time
to go back on shift.

50:55.910 --> 50:58.549
- You?
- Not for a bit.

50:59.990 --> 51:01.946
Right.

51:02.070 --> 51:04.709
Did she ever say anything about me?

51:07.910 --> 51:09.787
Well, she must like you.

51:12.110 --> 51:14.783
The way she talks about the others...

51:14.910 --> 51:17.105
A bus load, you said?

51:18.470 --> 51:20.745
The Romilly effect.

51:20.870 --> 51:25.466
One look, and they're "Romillied. "

51:25.590 --> 51:29.139
Who was she seeing?
I only mean it might be a way forward.

51:29.270 --> 51:32.785
- I know what you think about me.
- No, you don't.

51:34.710 --> 51:36.507
Well, I feel like an idiot.

51:36.630 --> 51:41.146
And you aren't the one standing here with the
Kestrel settings stuffed into your knickers.

51:44.470 --> 51:47.667
Look, I don't know
who she was seeing...

51:47.790 --> 51:52.341
and I really think
we'd better call this a day.

51:52.470 --> 51:54.347
Don't you?

51:59.550 --> 52:02.110
Bye, then.

52:03.470 --> 52:05.620
Miss Wallace.

52:08.390 --> 52:10.904
I haven't been lookir
to the right or left...

52:11.030 --> 52:15.979
so there's something
I didn't see clearly.

52:16.110 --> 52:18.988
What's that?

52:19.110 --> 52:21.305
That you're a remarkable...

52:23.910 --> 52:26.344
I think you're simply wonderful.

52:38.950 --> 52:42.738
Tom, nice of you to turn up.

52:42.870 --> 52:46.545
- Look, I don't know what Skynner's been saying.
- Shut the door.

52:50.870 --> 52:53.020
He wants you out.

52:53.150 --> 52:56.779
"Send him back to Cambridge,
and this time make the bugger walk. "

52:56.910 --> 52:59.026
I got you the rail pass.

52:59.150 --> 53:02.142
- Not now!
- No, you can't do that, Guy. Tell them you want to give me a couple of days.

53:02.270 --> 53:04.738
- Why?
- To see if I can find a way back into Shark.

53:04.870 --> 53:07.668
Tom, it was you that announced
that it couldn't be done in four days.

53:07.790 --> 53:10.224
It was you that made Skynner look
a fool in front of his clients.

53:10.350 --> 53:14.628
Now you want me to go back and
tell him... Piss off, for God's sake!

53:14.750 --> 53:19.062
Sorry, Guy. Hello, Thomas.
You'd better come and hear this.

53:19.190 --> 53:21.545
Two long signals from U-boat
headquarters in the last 12 hours.

53:21.670 --> 53:24.662
One just before midnight,
one just after. Rebroadcast twice.

53:24.790 --> 53:28.783
- Then nothing. U- boat fleet
is on radio silence. - Christ.

53:28.910 --> 53:32.266
They're on battle stations.

53:32.390 --> 53:35.507
Say 12 U-boats 20 miles apart...

53:35.630 --> 53:37.860
possibly two lines,
possibly three.

53:37.990 --> 53:41.699
An ambush covering
hundreds of miles of ocean.

53:41.830 --> 53:44.947
And this time,
we don't know where.

53:45.070 --> 53:48.346
And one golden rule...
absolute radio silence.

53:48.470 --> 53:50.984
- And wh... wh...
- What then?

53:51.110 --> 53:56.662
Either the convoy is lucky and misses
the ambush, or it isn't lucky.

53:56.790 --> 54:00.419
And the first U-boat to make contact
with the convoy breaks radio silence.

54:00.550 --> 54:03.781
- How?
- Minimally, using the short signal book.

54:03.910 --> 54:06.663
It compresses the necessary information
to a few letters...

54:06.790 --> 54:09.463
sighting of convoy,
position, course and speed.

54:09.590 --> 54:13.026
That's repeated every two hours. As it's picked up by the other U
- boats in the line...

54:13.150 --> 54:16.586
they start to converge on the convoy
and send a contact signal in their turn.

54:16.710 --> 54:19.224
Contact signal.

54:19.350 --> 54:22.945
They'll shadow the convoy till nightfall.
They prefer to attack in the dark.

54:24.590 --> 54:29.266
We haven't got as much time as we'd thought.
I'd say, a day, a day and a half at the outside.

54:32.470 --> 54:37.419
- Mary Jane Hawkins.
- The oracle has spoken.

54:37.550 --> 54:42.146
They changed the weather code, but they
didn't change the short signal code book.

54:42.270 --> 54:45.979
It's our way back into Shark,
so long as the U-boats find our convoy.

54:48.430 --> 54:50.307
Don't you see?
It's our convoy.

54:50.430 --> 54:53.308
We know what the U-boats are sending.
It's the crib that we've been looking for.

54:53.430 --> 54:56.149
- Would you get enough material?
- How many signals do you need?

54:56.270 --> 54:59.103
One group of letters
for the convoy sighted...

54:59.230 --> 55:01.903
two groups for grid reference, one group
for course, one group for speed.

55:02.030 --> 55:04.783
Five groups of letters
per contact signal every two hours.

55:04.910 --> 55:08.619
Shadowing the convoy for maybe 1 O hours,
12... that's 25 groups of letters.

55:08.750 --> 55:11.184
And how many U-boats joining in?
Eight, ten?

55:11.310 --> 55:14.905
Each one a contact signal
every two hours.

55:15.030 --> 55:18.386
My God, he's right.
He's found us a crib.

55:18.510 --> 55:23.140
- Brilliant.
- A-A-Appalling.

55:23.270 --> 55:26.740
We've never had an operation on this scale. The contact
signals could easily build up to give us a crib...

55:26.870 --> 55:30.419
of 1 OO group of letters and we've got
the short signal code book in the museum.

55:30.550 --> 55:33.018
He's right, Guy.

55:34.350 --> 55:36.545
Where are the keys to the museum?

55:36.670 --> 55:40.948
Good Christ, Tom. We have to protect
the convoys, not sacrifice them.

55:41.070 --> 55:44.107
You know what it's like out there.

55:44.230 --> 55:46.539
The success of this plan
depends on arranging a massacre.

55:46.670 --> 55:49.946
No. No, we are not arranging anything.
What happens is going to happen.

55:50.070 --> 55:53.107
But if we can use it to our advantage,
we'll be able to decipher every signal...

55:53.230 --> 55:55.983
sent by every U-boat
on the high seas for 24 hours!

55:56.110 --> 55:58.749
- Including the weather reports.
- Yeah. We'll have the plain text.

55:58.870 --> 56:00.781
We can make a start on reconstructing
the new weather code.

56:00.910 --> 56:04.949
- This puts us back in the fight.
- And there will be many more convoys to protect.

56:13.430 --> 56:15.307
You're back in business,
old thing.

56:46.350 --> 56:49.342
Garbled text from Beaumanor.
Somebody get on the blower.

56:49.470 --> 56:52.826
Miss Chamberlain, would you?
Get them to check their file copy.

56:58.110 --> 57:01.864
Pam, does Beaumanor keep copies
of everything they send us?

57:01.990 --> 57:05.187
- Yes. It's all there on file.
- Thank you.

57:05.310 --> 57:08.188
Hello. Could I have Beaumanor 392?

57:09.870 --> 57:12.464
Miss Wallace!

57:25.230 --> 57:27.505
No female visitors upstairs.
That's the rule!

57:30.070 --> 57:32.823
Mr Jericho, wake up.
It's not over.

57:32.950 --> 57:35.669
- We need to borrow your Enigma machine.
- Didrt you hear?

58:00.510 --> 58:04.219
Top copy goes straight to
your people by teleprinter...

58:04.350 --> 58:07.547
or by dispatch rider,
depending on priority.

58:07.670 --> 58:11.549
The second copy we keep,
in case of garbles.

58:11.670 --> 58:13.945
Can we see?

58:14.070 --> 58:17.540
Well, if you want.
There's not much to it.

58:17.670 --> 58:21.549
It's a treat for us, you know, a visit
from head office to the country cousins.

58:21.670 --> 58:23.945
It's good of you to say so,
but, um...

58:24.070 --> 58:27.858
a fat lot of use we'd be
without your intercepts, Major.

58:30.070 --> 58:33.904
We keep them a couple of months,
filed chronologically.

58:37.390 --> 58:42.259
These sets are tuned to the
Eastern Front... Kestrel, Buzzard, Kite.

58:42.390 --> 58:45.268
- And you're intercepting everything?
- Absolutely.

58:45.390 --> 58:48.109
Except that time
the other week, of course.

58:48.230 --> 58:49.868
Kestrel, wasn't it?

58:49.990 --> 58:55.508
Yes, your Miles Mermagen came
on the blower in a frightful panic.

58:55.630 --> 58:58.508
"No more ADU, thank you very much.
Not now, not ever. "

58:58.630 --> 59:01.224
- What's that about?
- Orders from above.

59:01.350 --> 59:04.501
We'd just sent him
four good, clean signals.

59:04.630 --> 59:07.349
It was Kay here who handled
our mystery station.

59:07.470 --> 59:08.983
Carry on.

59:09.110 --> 59:13.183
Yeah, he has a good fist, ADU.
Touch like a concert pianist.

59:13.310 --> 59:15.585
He's still transmitting?

59:15.710 --> 59:19.988
Of course, I don't take him down any
more, but he was awful busy last week.

59:20.110 --> 59:21.384
Oh, excuse me, sir.

59:25.270 --> 59:28.103
What was it you said
you did again, Mr...

59:28.230 --> 59:30.107
- Jericho.
- Jericho.

59:30.230 --> 59:33.745
Can't say, I'm afraid.
Catch you up.

59:37.670 --> 59:42.061
- Major, how many machines did you say you have here?
- We have 48 here.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.705
Excuse me.

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:29.943
He's on now,
if you're interested, sir.

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:09.384
Thank you.

01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:12.502
I don't mean
to bother you, sir...

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:14.700
but it is important,
isn't it?

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:18.709
I know I shouldn't ask.
I mean, no one ever tells us.

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:21.139
You are making sense of it?
It is important?

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.147
Yes.

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:27.104
This is our only war, you see,
in here... beep, beep, bloody beep.

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:29.539
And it's always nonsense,
nonsense, nonsense.

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:33.026
Yes, we are
making sense of it...

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:35.823
and it is important.

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:42.387
Eleven ADU signals
and launchings.

01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:50.780
That's the car.
Man, woman, two-seater roadster.

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:05.027
Invite him to stop, shall we?

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.988
Take him, man! Take him!

01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:54.342
Mr Jericho, stop! Stop! Stop!

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:57.068
Look out!

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:10.709
Shit.

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:15.779
Bravo, Mr Jericho.

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:18.470
Reckon, given the circumstances,
Miss Wallace...

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:20.660
we might now risk
first names.

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:25.670
Hester.

01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:27.667
Tom.

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.859
This might be good.
It looks deserted enough.

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:36.867
Well spotted.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.228
Bliss.

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:54.629
- What would they do to us if they knew?
- Feed us to the dogs.

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:57.139
Charming.

01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:04.819
Right.

01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:08.067
March and April
Beaumanor log sheets...

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:11.068
and the intercepts
from March 28th...

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:16.389
April 3rd, April 9th,
15th, 16th, 17th...

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:20.469
and Kestrel settings...
last one first.

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:23.104
Might tell us
why Claire disappeared.

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:25.949
Right. April 17, rotor order.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:28.345
3-5-4.

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:31.826
3-5-4.

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:37.541
R- X-O.

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:43.427
- Plug board settings.
- A-O-E-M.

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:50.305
The current passes
from the keyboard...

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:52.421
to the lamps by way
of the rotors and the plugs.

01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:56.099
And every time you press a key,
it changes the path of the current.

01:04:56.230 --> 01:05:00.746
Press the same key ten times, it comes
out ten different ways on the lamp board.

01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:05.386
You never know which letters
will light up. Simply brilliant.

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:15.099
Message key X-A-T.

01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:21.428
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:25.222
- "Y."
- "K."

01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:28.262
- "E."
- "A."

01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:30.585
"W."

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:32.109
"C."

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:34.744
- "U."
- Zed.

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:39.030
"M."

01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:41.505
"V."

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:48.186
- "Q"
- "X."

01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:54.381
It's not right, is it?
This isn't German.

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:56.626
Keep going. Sometimes the operator
pads out with nonsense.

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:10.985
Keep going.

01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:14.022
- Um, "K."
- Zed.

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:17.588
- "E."
- "R."

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.230
- "O."
- "A."

01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:25.068
- "F."
- "D."

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:30.139
Isn't German.
Come on, genius!

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.346
I'm sorry. It's double coded,
or the settings must be wrong.

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:44.062
It's all been for nothing.

01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:30.541
I'm afraid I have to ask you
to hurry up.

01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:22.140
Search the barn.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:33.341
This is Mr Leveret.
Detective Inspector Leveret.

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:37.224
He wants to know what you've been up to.
But first things first.

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:55.946
You've been here before?

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:01.267
And you?

01:09:06.029 --> 01:09:08.624
Line up in the street
and search the area.

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:13.020
Have a look at this, sir.
It's down there.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.868
- Right, sir.
- There?

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:18.379
Drag the river.

01:09:27.109 --> 01:09:32.024
Please talk to me! What do you want to
know? I'll tell you anything you want.

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:37.468
Give me your hand.

01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:42.180
Do you wanna know about Shark?
Any secret. Ask me!

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:47.140
Come this way.

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:51.661
I've got something to show you.
Get your notebook out.

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:56.427
Miss Wallace first.

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:04.384
I am showing the witness
one ladies' coat, colour grey...

01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:06.899
trimmed with black velvet.

01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:10.909
Label: Hunters, Burlington Arcade.

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:17.748
- And the witness responded...
- Yes. It's hers.

01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:20.304
Yes.

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:26.748
Next, one ladies' shoe...

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:29.179
black high heel.

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:31.619
Uh, heel snapped off.

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:35.542
And the witness responded...

01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:39.748
Yes.

01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:43.270
It's an old quarry.

01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:45.745
They built the town
with what they dug out.

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:49.226
That makes sense,
making one hole out of another.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:53.787
- How deep is it?
- Sixty, seventy foot in the middle.

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:58.627
Christ, we'll need a submarine.

01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:06.304
I would very much like
to arrest you...

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:08.819
but we don't have a body.

01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:13.942
It's a quarter to 8:OO.
Mr Leveret will take you back.

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.504
I believe your day
is just beginning.

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:30.344
Chaps.

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:36.982
Easy, everyone.
Just stopped by to wish you luck.

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:40.989
I'm sure you're all aware,
as I am, what's at stake here.

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:44.705
I don't think I'm exaggerating
when I say...

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:47.708
this could be one of
the decisive nights of the war.

01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:50.390
- So shut up, then.
- A mighty battle.

01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:52.501
Probably...

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:55.702
the greatest convoy battle
of all time is about to start.

01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:59.345
Three hours ago,
convoys HX 229A...

01:11:59.470 --> 01:12:02.348
229 and SC 122...

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:05.940
had entered the presumed
operational area...

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:07.822
of the U-boat packs.

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:11.618
Now, in our long island history...

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:15.026
we have picked up the gauntlet
more than a few times.

01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:16.947
Shakespeare coming up.

01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:22.190
"Out of this nettle, danger,
may we pluck this flower, safety. "

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:29.061
So, gentlemen, go to it.

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:50.505
<i>Come and dance.
Boop-boop</i>

01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:53.429
Come on. Come and dance.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.945
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can. It's easy.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:01.588
- No, really, you do it.
- Right, left.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.099
Left, left.

01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:06.790
Ah! You're getting the hang of it.

01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:26.940
C- Can someone remind me?

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:31.621
A- Are w-we hoping for the U-boats
to find the convoys, o-o-or not?

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:33.945
- Not.
- I am.

01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:38.109
- Yes, well, you would, Baxter.
- Y-You'd sacrifice o-o-our...

01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:41.905
Sacrifice a convoy
to get back into Shark? Of course.

01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:45.705
How many men has Stalin had
to sacrifice so far? Five million?

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:48.105
It's called the greater good.

01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:52.382
Spoken, of course, by someone who doesn't
happen to be in the North Atlantic at the moment.

01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:57.345
You can only fight your own war.
What do you think, Tom?

01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:01.459
About what?

01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:25.783
So, Claire,
what were you doing?

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:28.663
What were you hiding?

01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:55.301
Right.

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:57.990
Start at the beginning.

01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:02.387
Kestrel settings, March.

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:14.025
Atlantic time
is two hours behind.

01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:16.300
It's still dark.

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:38.185
Here, mate,
I got a lighter.

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:40.266
Thanks.

01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:50.068
"Urgent. "

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:52.465
Mary Jane Hawkins.

01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:54.706
It is German.

01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:34.944
Signal 7-3-6-9-K-C-S.

01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:37.746
We're in business.

01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:39.508
Direction finders have a fix.

01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:44.781
Scarborough, 2-5-9 degrees.

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:51.824
Witt, 2-4-6, 30 degrees.

01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:59.059
Flowerdown, 2-6-8 degrees.

01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:07.985
There she is...
37.5, 49.5.

01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:11.466
She's shadowing convoy HX 229.

01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:14.104
No air cover. Sitting ducks.

01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:16.300
Grid square?

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:21.867
B- D-1491.

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:24.265
- Convoy course?
- Seventy degrees.

01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:26.381
- Convoy speed.
- Ten knots.

01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:49.787
- From the code book, we have C-K-S-A
for convoy sighted. - First message?

01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:53.300
K- A-F-B-N-W-Zed-Jacob
for position.

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:57.503
Q- K-D-X for course, Q-R-Zed-A for speed.
That's five four-letter groups.

01:18:57.630 --> 01:19:02.499
Message setting, B-H-B.

01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:14.820
"A-V, V-K, A-K."

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:16.542
Check.

01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:23.025
Yeah, me too.

01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:28.948
- "M-S, S-M."
- Check.

01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:31.948
Two loops. Confirmed?

01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:34.459
And no clashes.

01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:36.546
O4.

01:19:36.670 --> 01:19:38.388
One down.

01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:40.546
Now the wolves
will be gathering.

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:07.750
Still nonsense. Why?

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:13.149
Can you fix B-D-1611?
Convoy speed and direction same.

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:17.388
New position:
K- A-F-V, N-C-L-A.

01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:20.388
Skynner's offered a bottle of Scotch
to the first man to come up with a menu.

01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:23.707
- Does he know I'm still here?
- He didn't ask.

01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:25.946
Oh, Puck, there's a message
left for you at the switchboard.

01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:29.028
It's Adelphi 4-2-4-3.

01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:32.267
There's no name,
and I'm not your social secretary.

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:35.541
- Message key: R-M-U.
- Sorry, Guy.

01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:38.548
How much more material
do you need?

01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:42.948
We've got 9 signals.
Another 20, 25 would be better.

01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:45.948
Suppose it starts
before you have them.

01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:57.463
Naval grid square B-D-1386.

01:20:57.590 --> 01:21:00.980
Course: 70 degrees.
Speed of convoy: 1 O knots.

01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:08.540
I'm pretty sure there's enough
for a stab at a menu. Let's try it.

01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:12.663
- You have 17 contacts, Mr Jericho.
- It's not enough.

01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:14.826
Well, why the hell not?

01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:19.747
When I'm done, we'll be looking
for a needle in a haystack...

01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:23.658
but if we stop now it'll be
a hundred thousand haystacks.

01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:27.827
You know that.

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:32.262
Full moon.
Ten U-boats, somewhere.

01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:36.429
Thirty-seven merchants, five escorts, one
of which has lost contact with the convoy.

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:39.747
No rescue ship
and no air cover.

01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:41.940
Eighteen.

01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:45.267
- Flowerdown, 2-6-8 degrees.
- It's what you might call a bitch.

01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:05.906
- Twenty-three.
- Not enough.

01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:35.230
- What have you got?
- I need one more link.

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:37.705
I can't see it.

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:43.428
Names. They're names.

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:46.269
- You?
- No.

01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:49.666
Getting a very bad feeling now.

01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:53.379
Polish names.

01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:03.745
- There.
- Yes.

01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:15.543
- Menu.
- Let's hope to God it works.

01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:24.826
It's started. Bastards.

01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:53.541
Don't you have homes to go to?

01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:16.783
- How's it going?
- Four hits so far.

01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:19.219
Probably 300 men lost.

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:23.389
A Dutch cargo and a Norwegian freighter
went straight to the bottom.

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:26.263
And an American liberty ship's
on fire.

01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:29.746
Half the crew are drowning.
The other half are trying to save them.

01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:37.503
Tom. Unfinished business.

01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:42.424
Congratulations.

01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:45.144
It's a half bottle,
as it turns out.

01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:48.738
Typical Skynner.

01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:51.464
That should go back.

01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:53.546
Where's the museum key?

01:24:53.670 --> 01:24:56.138
Oh, sorry, Guy.
I've still got it.

01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:59.626
Tsk, tsk.
Security around here.

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:02.662
Then get off home, old thing.

01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:05.987
- Havert you got a girl waiting for you?
- She's dead.

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:56.506
Tom.

01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:01.860
Oh, my God. Come on.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.550
- What?
- Come on.

01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:06.422
It's Polish.

01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:08.427
Polish names, all of them.

01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:11.542
The Germans
found a mass grave.

01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:15.583
Look, doesn't it say
4,OOO corpses?

01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:22.259
"Polish officers buried
in the forest at Katyn in 1940...

01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:25.268
"during the Soviet occupation.

01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:27.460
Shot in the back of the head. "

01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:29.740
Murdered by the Russians.

01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:32.338
By our Russian allies.

01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:35.268
They were comrades-in-arms
against the Nazis.

01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:38.348
My God.

01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:41.780
That's why the file was empty...
on the orders of Secret Intelligence.

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:46.700
And that's why Beaumanor was ordered
to stop intercepting the signals.

01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:48.786
It was too big a secret.

01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:52.300
Just knowing that
can get you killed.

01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:56.059
And Claire discovered it.

01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:58.988
Copied it into the German book,
and she had to tell...

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:01.544
someone.

01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:09.818
- Adam Pukowski.
- What?

01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:11.588
Missing in action.

01:27:11.710 --> 01:27:14.508
Kid brother of Jozef Pukowski.

01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:16.143
Claire stole those intercepts
for Puck...

01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:19.580
because he was looking
for his brother's name.

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:22.702
- Puck!
- Wait! Please!

01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:25.583
This Puck killed her. Why?

01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:30.500
Because he had a secret, too,
and she could've given him away.

01:27:30.630 --> 01:27:32.780
- What secret?
- I can't tell you that!

01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:34.662
Tom!

01:27:56.990 --> 01:28:00.824
Hello. Could you get me
London Adelphi 4-2-4-3, please?

01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:03.544
<i>I'm sorry. That number
is not in service.</i>

01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:11.503
What the hell is this about, you and
some skirt waltzing around Beaumanor?

01:28:11.630 --> 01:28:15.020
Leonard, unless you're asking me
to dance, let go of my arm!

01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:19.348
I should've cooked your goose when you
made a fool of yourself over that blonde...

01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:25.066
who fucked half the park.

01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:26.942
What?

01:29:16.630 --> 01:29:19.588
Stand away! Stand away!

01:29:25.190 --> 01:29:27.146
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:32.668
He's two carriages up.
Snug as a bug in a rug.

01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:35.349
Morning, sir.

01:29:48.230 --> 01:29:50.027
You knew?

01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:52.425
About Pukowski?

01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:55.542
We had no proof,
but when Miss Romilly went missing...

01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:59.982
- Puck and Claire were having an...
- Were seeing each other, as you like to put it.

01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:02.260
Seeing each other's
brains out.

01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:05.621
Jozef Pukowski, who'd been wondering
what could have happened...

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:09.265
to all those Polish officers who hadrt been
heard from since the first year of the war...

01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:11.267
and Claire Romilly...

01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:15.702
<i>who was reading the Wermacht traffic
from the Eastern Front.</i>

01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:18.708
They were made for each other.

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:21.708
And lo, mass graves.

01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:24.822
Polish uniforms, names.

01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:29.068
- We've been bracing ourselves for the Nazi propaganda.
- Propaganda?

01:30:30.710 --> 01:30:34.180
Four thousand Poles
murdered by Stalin?

01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:37.188
It's what Hitler would
give his last ball for.

01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:41.383
Think of all those Polish names
in the U.S. Of A.

01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:45.219
Think of our convoys
full of American goods...

01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:47.306
some of them
in American ships...

01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:51.309
running the U-boat gauntlet so our
supplies can keep Stalin in business.

01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:54.183
- But it's true, isn't it?
- The Katyn massacre?

01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:59.384
Oh, really, do shut up. There's a war
to win, and Stalirs helping us win it.

01:30:59.510 --> 01:31:00.863
And they hate
the Russians, you know.

01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:03.379
They've hated them
for centuries.

01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:05.899
So what's Pukowski
going to do to get back at them?

01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:08.703
Help the enemy. That's what.

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:12.061
His enemy's enemy.

01:31:12.190 --> 01:31:16.661
And he's got a big piece of knowledge
that can help the Germans... Shark.

01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:20.703
- The weather code.
- Claire couldn't have known what he'd do. She wasn't a traitor.

01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:23.105
I'm sure you're right.

01:31:23.230 --> 01:31:26.540
But then Pukowski heard
that you were coming back.

01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:31.266
Jericho, the lover who wouldn't let go,
who'd cracked once before.

01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:34.780
The swot who was invited to the ball,
found Cinderella's slipper...

01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:36.787
and went so crazy
he would've told her anything.

01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:40.983
And you would have, wouldn't you?
About how we lost Shark.

01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:43.863
And the rumour that there was a mole
in the park, probably in your hut.

01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:48.427
How long would it have taken Claire to work
out that the traitor was Puck? About a minute.

01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:50.427
So he killed her.

01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:58.068
One-way to Manchester,
according to the ticket collector.

01:31:58.190 --> 01:32:00.181
Change the watch.

01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:07.579
Well, let's see where
and to whom he will lead us, hmm?

01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:19.140
<i>Train approaching, platform three.</i>

01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:22.899
<i>It's the 3:15 to Manchester.</i>

01:32:25.710 --> 01:32:28.429
How do you get the petrol coupons
to go zipping up and down to London?

01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:32.862
Secret, darling. I know a chap.

01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:41.139
<i>Train standing, platform three.
3:15 for Manchester only.</i>

01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:03.708
Manchester, next stop.

01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:06.060
That's it for you.

01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:10.502
Go home, keep your head down...

01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:13.508
and I might try and forget about you and
your moll breaking the Highway Code...

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:15.780
and the Official Secrets Act
on the same day.

01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:18.866
<i>Train standing, platform three.</i>

01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:22.619
<i>3:15 to Manchester only.</i>

01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:27.904
You've been trying to frighten me into
keeping my head down right from the start. Why?

01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:30.942
Because somehow
I frighten you. Why?

01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:34.858
Because of Claire.
My connection with Claire.

01:33:36.190 --> 01:33:38.067
Be careful now.

01:33:42.630 --> 01:33:45.542
The night you came to my room, you
already had Pukowski in your sights...

01:33:45.670 --> 01:33:48.343
yet you went out of your way
to play the heavy with me.

01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:51.348
And then you were more concerned about
Claire Romilly than you were about Shark.

01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:54.621
- A girl who'd missed her shift? Why?
- Why? She was his girlfriend.

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:58.106
Oh, no. She was more than that.

01:33:58.230 --> 01:34:02.143
She was working for you.
Claire was your agent.

01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:06.104
She told you everything,
even how I found her shoe.

01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:14.587
As you said, Bletchley was a security nightmare,
so you put a girl in the park to do your dirty work.

01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:16.701
Surely you mean
her patriotic duty.

01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:20.982
Everything that she did, she did because you
told her. You had her fucking for England.

01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:26.382
And then when she got to Pukowski,
it went wrong. She took pity on him...

01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:28.899
and she told him what she was
writing in the German book.

01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:32.981
No wonder you were frightened.

01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:37.820
You'd made a terrible mistake, and your
agent paid for it with her life. Claire.

01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:41.187
He's jumped!

01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:48.668
He's gone!

01:34:52.670 --> 01:34:56.299
Come on! Back it up!
Back the train up!

01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:06.620
What are they doing?

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:28.549
Sir, please. The statiors clear.
Roadblocks are in place.

01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:32.219
- Search the train again.
- He's not on the train!

01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:35.501
- We'll have to let it go.
- Please be patient.

01:35:57.870 --> 01:36:01.909
Oh, Puck, there's a message left for you
at the switchboard. It's Adelphi 4-2-4-3.

01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:13.506
- Keep the change.
- Thank you very much.

01:36:13.630 --> 01:36:16.019
- To the station, rather fast, please.
- Ma'am.

01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:35.828
You bloody idiot.
This time I can't save you.

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:37.827
You broke Skynner's cheekbone.

01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:42.823
Tom. Well, weather code is,
uh, c-c-cracking open.

01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:45.418
Where's Puck?

01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:50.701
- Check our weather report...
- How bad is it?

01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:52.821
It's bad.

01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:56.147
But we are reading Shark,
thanks to you lot.

01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:03.586
- What's this? - Grid square A-M-2-9.
We think it's a garbled signal.

01:38:03.710 --> 01:38:06.304
- Signal to a U-boat?
- Mmm. U-617.

01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:09.740
Ordered out of battle
to proceed immedi...

01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:11.223
Yes?

01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:13.102
Where is this?

01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:18.145
Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where
I'd like to be old. If I'm ever old.

01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:23.139
So, it's the real thing.
U-671, rendezvous in 24 hours.

01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:26.546
Our turn to find a sitting duck.

01:38:26.670 --> 01:38:28.149
My God.

01:38:58.230 --> 01:39:00.107
- Be careful.
- I will.

01:39:59.950 --> 01:40:01.178
Damn it.

01:40:20.150 --> 01:40:22.664
- I'm on the chosen frequency.
- Sir.

01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:26.499
- There's probably interference.
- Swing around. I'll fine-tune it.

01:40:26.630 --> 01:40:28.507
Perfect.

01:40:28.630 --> 01:40:31.508
Just in time to bugger up
the whole operation.

01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:50.338
- Do you want to abort?
- Are you serious?

01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:21.543
- I didn't kill her.
- I know.

01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:24.264
Do you think
I'm here for that?

01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:32.138
- That's right, my darling.
- They're ready.

01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:35.228
Up you come.

01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:37.227
What about the rest of it?

01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:40.740
The real secret you want to tell the
Germans, about how we really broke the code?

01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:44.749
- About my machines!
- Thomas, Thomas.

01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:47.065
- You can have your enemy. Let me have mine.
- No.

01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:49.260
Well, shoot me, then.

01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:53.065
- It's your show, but your man...
- He is not my man.

01:41:53.190 --> 01:41:55.226
Serve it up.

01:41:57.710 --> 01:42:01.544
- Go ahead.
- Tell Auntie Mae the package is ready.

01:42:17.670 --> 01:42:19.183
Dinner's ready.

01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:50.105
Bullseye!

01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:37.466
- Run out a couple of yards there.
- You're looking in the wrong place.

01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:40.660
Oh, it's Mr Jericho.

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:46.025
Come home again
with his batteries dried out.

01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:48.300
You turned out to be
some swot.

01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:53.868
- I tip my hat to you.
- She's not there. Didrt you hear me?

01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:57.141
She's moved on.

01:43:59.350 --> 01:44:02.820
The murder scene was like
a pile of clothes left on a beach.

01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:05.225
Sometimes it means
somebody's dead.

01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:08.228
Sometimes it means
somebody wanted to disappear.

01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:11.228
Like an agent who'd been
turned by her target.

01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:14.228
It was you
who saw it before I did.

01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:16.341
What makes you think that?

01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:19.382
Pukowski was on the train,
and you were letting him run.

01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:24.379
He knew the secret that could lose us
the war. Remember? The thinking machine.

01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:27.263
You were holding back to see
who he would lead you to.

01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:30.700
Who the hell could it be
to make you take that risk?

01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:32.548
Only Claire.

01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:34.900
Well, I was wrong, wasn't I?

01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:37.066
She wasn't with Pukowski.

01:44:37.190 --> 01:44:41.661
She was waiting for him up the line to
take him to her little Scottish hideaway...

01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:44.907
where a couple of runaway lovers
could sit out the rest of the war.

01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:47.828
Do you think I didn't check?

01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:51.909
She loved him, and Pukowski brought her
all the way to the brink...

01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:54.225
but then he had to tell her
what she didn't know...

01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:58.059
about the U-boat
coming to pick him up, and why.

01:44:58.190 --> 01:45:00.306
If they got caught,
they'd both hang.

01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:04.742
But there was no going back.
Only forward, to Germany.

01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:06.906
But then,
he didn't know Claire.

01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:09.624
She was no traitor.

01:45:11.230 --> 01:45:14.028
She's out there, somewhere...

01:45:14.150 --> 01:45:17.699
like a sword
hanging over your head.

01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:20.821
In different ways,
she fooled us all.

01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:24.022
She was unreadable.

01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:31.423
- Stick to sums.
- I think I've got something! Easy does it!

01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:34.064
What have you got there?

01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:35.908
Steady.

01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:38.703
- We're losing her, lads.
- Do you want it to be her?

01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:41.105
Steady, now.

01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:46.104
False alarm!

01:45:46.230 --> 01:45:49.063
Shut up.

01:45:49.190 --> 01:45:51.579
Keep looking.

01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:55.224
Oh, I will.

01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:57.580
I will.

01:47:24.190 --> 01:47:27.182
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.

01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:31.098
I was getting worried
about you two.
