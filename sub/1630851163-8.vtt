WEBVTT

00:18.936 --> 00:19.937
Fire!

00:31.406 --> 00:32.658
Close the gates.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.424
Haniwa!

00:49.508 --> 00:50.509
I'm here.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.388
I'm here.

00:56.515 --> 01:00.602
If you leave my side again,
I'll kill you myself.

01:00.686 --> 01:01.687
That's fair.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.480
Trivantians!

01:04.313 --> 01:06.149
Advance!

02:52.172 --> 02:55.217
Gather your wits and your breath.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.178
We'll make our stand here.

02:58.262 --> 03:01.515
There's too many of them.
We don't have enough soldiers.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.059
-We'll hold them.
-For how long?

03:05.435 --> 03:06.436
Baba.

03:08.146 --> 03:11.358
Long enough to send word
to your mother to evacuate the city.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.778
Kofun, Haniwa, ride to Pennsa
as fast as you can.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.904
What?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.866
There's nothing more
that you can do here, my son.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.158
Dad, we can fight.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.493
I'm your only archer.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.036
If you stay here, you will die.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.246
Then we die.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.455
Then we die.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.459
The two of you are stubborn fools!

03:29.543 --> 03:30.878
Commander Ferik.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.087
Witchfinder General.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.967
Send your swiftest rider to Queen Maghra
with this immediately.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.051
Yes, sir.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.438
They retreated into the fortress
and closed the gate.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.400
Let's get those gates down, now!

03:53.483 --> 03:54.610
Lift!

03:54.693 --> 03:55.694
Forward!

04:00.991 --> 04:01.992
Halt!

04:18.966 --> 04:22.971
Soldiers, take your positions!

04:26.391 --> 04:27.559
Move.

04:43.116 --> 04:43.951
Dad.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.622
Do you hear that?

04:51.041 --> 04:53.085
-They're breaking through the gate.
-Not that.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.009
That.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.053
What is that?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.223
The Hidden Tribes.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.786
Bow!

05:29.371 --> 05:31.665
Kofun. You're alive.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.378
-Paris!
-Baba.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.672
Baba.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.756
Lion.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.262
-We stand with Baba.
-You brought the Valier.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.930
We've brought you more than that.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.225
The Valier stand with Baba Voss!

05:50.309 --> 05:53.770
-The Salvin stand with Baba Voss.
-We fight!

05:53.854 --> 05:55.606
The Yeliss stand with Baba Voss.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.150
The Reyenne stand with Baba Voss.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.735
How many fighters?

05:59.818 --> 06:01.069
More than 100.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.822
A hundred mountain warriors are worth
twice as many Witchfinders.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.616
They'll have to be.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.994
Kofun, take Paris to safety.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.162
I'm uphill.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.040
Chet-chet.

06:13.749 --> 06:14.833
Toad.

06:18.837 --> 06:19.922
Kofun.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.759
Seems like they'll let anyone
into the wars these days.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.010
Any advice?

06:26.512 --> 06:30.974
The Trivantians are all leather and steel.
If it rings, stab it.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.976
I can see, remember?

06:34.019 --> 06:35.646
That's what I'm afraid of.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.956
Who's there?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.420
Maghra.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.090
Surprised you have time to check in on me,

07:03.632 --> 07:05.425
what with the war you're waging.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.345
The war you started.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.847
Yes.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.393
I understand your own children
have joined the cause.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.188
All that time you spent nattering away
at me about keeping them safe--

07:18.272 --> 07:19.356
Be quiet.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.483
I'm not here to have a conversation.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.987
I just need you to answer one question.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.117
This baby you carry…

07:32.661 --> 07:33.662
whose is it?

07:34.288 --> 07:35.539
Come on, Maghra.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.250
I know you must have suspected as much.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.962
Sweet Kofun.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.717
Not my first choice, I'll grant you,
but he performed admirably.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.014
You're lying.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.268
I should have let Tamacti kill you.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.997
My son won't just be your nephew.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.042
He'll be your grandson as well.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.544
He will be neither,

08:23.754 --> 08:25.589
because he will never be your son.

08:27.716 --> 08:31.303
I will take him from you
the moment he is born,

08:31.386 --> 08:33.347
and he will never know you.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.765
Not even your name.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.773
I may be your prisoner now, sister,
but you watch what you say to me.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.779
It's not the first time
I've been in chains.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.573
They tend not to hold me very long.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.911
I will have you buried in these chains.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.625
Take care of my crown, Maghra.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.710
I'll be wanting it back.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.689
How are you feeling?

09:24.606 --> 09:25.899
I've felt better.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.821
I'm told you will heal just fine.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.699
Yeah, well, either way, you're welcome.

09:35.659 --> 09:36.994
I'm sorry?

09:37.870 --> 09:39.371
For saving your life?

09:43.709 --> 09:45.752
I believe it was I who saved you.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.797
No, no, it wasn't.
It's not how I remember it.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.591
It's certainly not how I'll tell it.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.969
Those were Lowland Assassins.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.221
Very few people meet them
and live to talk about it.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.974
It was brave of you to attempt a rescue.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.060
You'll get no disagreement from me.

10:02.561 --> 10:06.106
My Queen, Lord Harlan.
The army reached Greenhill Gap,

10:06.190 --> 10:07.566
as did the Trivantians.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.194
Our next runner
should have news of the battle.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.280
Thank you.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.660
It begins.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.796
We have spent our lives

10:31.173 --> 10:34.218
cowering in the shadow
of the Trivantian empire…

10:36.887 --> 10:38.722
wondering when the day would come

10:40.307 --> 10:44.436
when they would march their army
into our land to make it their own…

10:47.022 --> 10:49.733
making slaves of our wives,

10:50.734 --> 10:53.111
husbands, sons and daughters.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.698
And now,

10:58.158 --> 10:59.535
and now that day has come.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.914
On the other side of that wall

11:05.123 --> 11:07.543
is the army that we have all feared
for so long.

11:08.877 --> 11:12.673
And their victory will mean the end
of everything that we hold dear.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.386
But when they come through that wall,

11:18.387 --> 11:21.515
they will not find the frightened army
they are expecting.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.895
We are Payan soldiers,

11:28.230 --> 11:31.233
mountain warriors, Witchfinders.

11:31.316 --> 11:36.029
Former enemies banded together
for one purpose and one purpose only:

11:36.697 --> 11:39.575
to protect what is ours at all costs!

11:47.332 --> 11:48.625
I know this enemy.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.962
I was this enemy.

11:53.172 --> 11:56.633
They fight to enslave.
They fight for greed.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.720
We fight for love.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.600
They fight for conquest.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.561
We fight for our families.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.229
We fight for our freedom!

12:14.568 --> 12:15.777
I am a father

12:17.237 --> 12:20.824
fighting side by side with my children.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.202
I am a husband

12:23.952 --> 12:27.206
fighting to protect my queen.

12:27.289 --> 12:32.252
I am your friend fighting for your freedom
until the day that I die.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.172
I am Baba Voss,

12:36.006 --> 12:40.177
and I say let us not wait
until they knock down our gate!

12:41.512 --> 12:43.680
I say we open it right now

12:45.015 --> 12:46.558
and welcome them to hell.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.821
Baba.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.838
They're opening the doors.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.390
Scouts.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.327
Crossbows, advance.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.453
Forward march!

15:16.792 --> 15:18.502
Aim high! Three quarters!

15:23.924 --> 15:25.092
Forward march.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.428
Aim left, one quarter.

15:32.558 --> 15:33.809
Forward march!

15:35.435 --> 15:37.396
Aim center high!

15:42.860 --> 15:43.861
Forward march!

15:45.237 --> 15:47.489
-Aim center high.
-Fire!

16:04.840 --> 16:08.093
Full attack! Take the fucking fort!

17:50.195 --> 17:51.280
On your left!

18:56.762 --> 18:57.763
Please.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.617
Is it still lit?

19:18.700 --> 19:20.118
Yes.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.286
Shit.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.122
No!

19:24.206 --> 19:25.332
-"No"?
-Fuck!

19:25.415 --> 19:27.084
You're a mountain man.
Can't you light a fire?

19:27.709 --> 19:29.837
Yes, I'm a man. I can light a fire.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.213
Go hold them off.

19:52.484 --> 19:53.485
Baba!

19:53.569 --> 19:54.695
Almost!

19:55.946 --> 19:57.114
Hot.

19:58.949 --> 20:01.076
Good, because there's a war
happening out here!

20:07.249 --> 20:08.250
Now!

21:23.992 --> 21:26.370
Crossbows! To me!

21:29.540 --> 21:31.083
One quarter left!

21:31.875 --> 21:32.876
Fire!

21:36.338 --> 21:38.131
Three one quarter right!

21:39.466 --> 21:40.467
Fire!

21:44.179 --> 21:45.347
Two left!

21:45.430 --> 21:46.515
Fire!

21:47.599 --> 21:49.810
-Three one quarter right!
-Fire!

21:51.603 --> 21:55.941
Aim high three quarters.
Aim left one quarter.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.237
-Toad, follow that voice!
-Two left!

22:00.737 --> 22:02.447
One quarter left!

22:07.661 --> 22:08.954
Two left!

22:10.664 --> 22:12.249
One quarter right!

22:14.126 --> 22:15.252
One quarter left!

22:43.780 --> 22:45.032
Kofun. Kofun!

22:46.992 --> 22:49.077
Saving your ass is starting to feel
like my only job.

22:49.161 --> 22:50.662
Don't stop now.

22:58.754 --> 22:59.755
Shit.

23:06.053 --> 23:07.763
-Kofun!
-Toad.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.730
Get off me.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.315
What are you doing?
There's a battle going on.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.150
I'm not leaving you like this.

23:22.069 --> 23:23.695
It's not you who's leaving.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.160
Tell Paris…

23:33.789 --> 23:34.957
Tell her what?

23:38.585 --> 23:39.878
She'll know.

23:44.258 --> 23:46.969
Now, do me a favor.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.055
Go kill someone.

24:25.424 --> 24:27.134
Tamacti Jun!

24:29.386 --> 24:30.762
Baba Voss!

24:34.850 --> 24:36.268
Just checking to see if you're dead.

24:37.686 --> 24:38.687
Not yet.

24:44.109 --> 24:45.194
There are more of them.

24:46.069 --> 24:47.070
Many more.

25:19.353 --> 25:20.354
No!

27:17.679 --> 27:18.722
Bow Lion!

27:19.473 --> 27:20.682
Bow Lion!

27:23.393 --> 27:24.770
Now!

27:47.459 --> 27:49.461
Now, where are they?

27:51.213 --> 27:52.297
Where are they?

27:55.384 --> 27:57.427
Come on! What?

28:21.994 --> 28:23.412
What's happening?

28:27.207 --> 28:29.626
What was that? What?

28:39.219 --> 28:40.220
Oh, no.

28:41.847 --> 28:43.307
Fall back!

28:44.224 --> 28:46.768
Fall back!

29:33.106 --> 29:36.068
Fall back! Fall back!

29:39.905 --> 29:42.241
Fall back!

29:43.992 --> 29:45.285
Wren?

29:52.501 --> 29:53.627
Wren!

29:57.506 --> 29:58.966
Wren!

31:29.890 --> 31:31.099
Kofun!

31:31.934 --> 31:33.352
Haniwa!

31:34.937 --> 31:36.980
Kofun! Haniwa!

31:37.064 --> 31:38.774
-Papa! Papa.
-Baby.

31:38.857 --> 31:40.192
We did it.

31:40.275 --> 31:41.318
We won.

31:42.486 --> 31:45.948
-You're not hurt.
-No, I'm okay.

31:46.031 --> 31:48.951
And so is Kofun. I saw him earlier.

31:58.919 --> 32:00.045
You stay here.

32:01.713 --> 32:03.465
-What is it?
-Do as I say.

32:04.383 --> 32:06.426
You find Paris and make sure she's okay.

32:07.469 --> 32:08.470
Okay.

32:08.554 --> 32:10.013
I love you.

32:27.990 --> 32:29.408
You can see.

32:31.994 --> 32:33.954
We have the same father.

32:34.037 --> 32:35.998
Jerlamarel is your father?

32:36.081 --> 32:37.082
Yes.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.294
But you're fighting for the wrong side.

32:40.377 --> 32:41.420
No.

32:47.426 --> 32:51.305
People like us,
we're always on the same side.

32:55.142 --> 32:56.143
This is Charlotte.

32:58.187 --> 32:59.980
I'm going to take you somewhere safe.

33:00.939 --> 33:02.274
I don't want to go with her.

33:03.233 --> 33:07.237
Well, I don't want to take you.
But you won't hear me complaining.

33:39.478 --> 33:41.772
You okay to get up? Yeah? Okay.

34:17.224 --> 34:18.225
Edo.

34:18.976 --> 34:21.812
You always did hear better
than the Ayuras.

34:23.397 --> 34:25.399
You still have Ranger's whistle.

34:26.024 --> 34:27.400
He gave it to me

34:28.902 --> 34:31.572
right before they locked him up
for helping you escape.

34:32.406 --> 34:33.866
Everyone close to you

34:34.783 --> 34:36.409
always ends up suffering.

34:40.998 --> 34:42.456
Now it's your turn.

34:46.003 --> 34:47.629
Leave this place, Edo.

34:49.297 --> 34:51.884
Please. It is over.

34:52.842 --> 34:55.344
No, it's not over,

34:56.096 --> 34:57.890
not while you're still breathing.

35:22.331 --> 35:23.832
I don't want to kill you.

35:23.916 --> 35:25.042
Don't worry.

35:25.626 --> 35:26.877
You're not going to.

37:30.626 --> 37:31.710
Goodbye, brother.

37:50.896 --> 37:52.981
Our father couldn't make me kill you,

37:54.316 --> 37:55.734
and neither can you.

38:17.005 --> 38:18.674
No! No!

38:41.154 --> 38:41.989
Edo.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.159
What did you do?

38:56.503 --> 39:00.007
There was no going home for me
after this defeat.

39:01.842 --> 39:03.510
You could have come with me.

39:07.306 --> 39:11.810
Even you could not have kept me
from a Payan rope.

39:14.229 --> 39:15.898
It didn't have to be this way.

39:22.988 --> 39:25.032
We were raised as warriors.

39:27.659 --> 39:30.621
It's always been our fate
to die like this, Baba,

39:31.997 --> 39:33.707
bleeding into the earth.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.505
Tell me…

39:42.508 --> 39:45.302
did our father really instruct you
to kill me?

39:51.391 --> 39:52.476
Yes, he did.

39:59.983 --> 40:01.276
What a prick.

40:13.372 --> 40:14.498
Edo.

40:18.752 --> 40:19.753
Edo.

40:32.975 --> 40:36.436
Is there anything I can say
to convince you to come back with me?

40:38.397 --> 40:40.482
You wouldn't have to hide
who you are anymore.

40:49.700 --> 40:51.618
You know I can't do that.

40:52.911 --> 40:54.079
Why not?

40:56.707 --> 40:57.791
My family,

40:59.501 --> 41:00.794
my home,

41:01.461 --> 41:04.423
I couldn't leave them any more
than you could leave yours.

41:17.144 --> 41:19.271
I can't be at war with you.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.442
I don't want that either.

41:38.373 --> 41:40.125
You're still wearing the necklace.

41:43.253 --> 41:45.297
Well, it does say "forever."

41:49.176 --> 41:50.344
Well, then…

41:52.346 --> 41:54.097
don't ever take it off.

42:53.532 --> 42:54.825
What are you doing?

42:58.161 --> 42:59.204
Let's talk later.

42:59.288 --> 43:02.875
You just freed a Trivantian officer
because she can see.

43:04.042 --> 43:05.210
Is that how it works?

43:05.294 --> 43:07.963
-If you have vision, you're forgiven?
-Of course not.

43:08.922 --> 43:11.425
I heard what you said to the kid, Haniwa.

43:12.176 --> 43:14.261
"People like us are always
on the same side."

43:14.344 --> 43:16.930
After everything,
you still think you're special?

43:17.014 --> 43:18.015
We are special.

43:18.932 --> 43:20.684
She's just killed dozens of our people!

43:20.767 --> 43:22.019
She is my people!

43:27.191 --> 43:28.567
She is my people.

43:31.153 --> 43:32.154
So what am I?

43:38.535 --> 43:39.536
What am I?

44:17.366 --> 44:18.825
Here he is.

44:18.909 --> 44:20.077
Toad's horse?

44:20.786 --> 44:22.120
Yeah.

44:28.085 --> 44:29.503
Where is Haniwa?

44:29.586 --> 44:31.964
-Haniwa.
-I'm here.

44:32.047 --> 44:33.841
It's time. Let's go home.

44:35.050 --> 44:38.053
-I don't even know where that is anymore.
-Yes, you do.

44:39.221 --> 44:40.931
It's where she is.

44:59.825 --> 45:00.826
Haniwa?

45:08.792 --> 45:09.793
Mama.

45:10.502 --> 45:11.503
Haniwa!

45:11.587 --> 45:12.588
Mom.

45:13.338 --> 45:14.506
-Kofun?
-Mama.

46:53.188 --> 46:54.314
Thank you…

46:56.775 --> 46:59.236
for bringing our babies home safely.

47:01.822 --> 47:03.907
I think it was they who brought me home.

47:08.453 --> 47:09.580
You were right.

47:11.582 --> 47:14.668
It is time for us to stop treating them
like children.

47:16.962 --> 47:18.172
They fought bravely.

47:20.757 --> 47:22.384
They don't need me anymore.

47:23.927 --> 47:26.263
I think they need you more than you know.

47:28.390 --> 47:29.641
We all do.

47:39.693 --> 47:41.820
I'm just so happy to have you back.

47:46.325 --> 47:47.701
I don't belong here.

47:52.414 --> 47:54.374
You belong with me.

48:09.389 --> 48:13.644
For generations, the Witchfinders
have been the backbone of this monarchy.

48:14.645 --> 48:17.189
Holy warriors in service of the crown.

48:18.190 --> 48:21.818
And for that, I offer you all
my enduring gratitude

48:22.528 --> 48:24.988
and the gratitude of this nation.

48:25.656 --> 48:27.366
But the world has changed,

48:28.283 --> 48:31.745
and in this new world
there are no longer any witches,

48:32.955 --> 48:35.457
so no need for Witchfinders.

48:35.541 --> 48:38.126
But, more than ever,

48:38.919 --> 48:42.172
there remains the need for brave warriors.

48:43.924 --> 48:44.925
Tamacti Jun.

48:53.308 --> 48:55.018
Witchfinder General,

48:56.311 --> 48:58.939
your charter is changed,
but your rank remains.

48:59.565 --> 49:04.194
From this day forward,
you are High General of the Payan army.

49:04.862 --> 49:08.240
And you, brave and loyal soldiers,

49:09.116 --> 49:11.994
are all officers of the Royal Guard.

49:24.673 --> 49:26.175
There are those of you

49:27.426 --> 49:28.677
who will not agree,

49:29.636 --> 49:32.097
as a matter of principle,
with this change.

49:33.599 --> 49:36.185
I will not compel you
to a service you did not choose.

49:37.227 --> 49:39.521
For any of you who feel this way,

49:40.731 --> 49:45.235
I absolve you of the blood oath
you swore upon conscription.

49:46.236 --> 49:47.654
You are free to leave

49:48.739 --> 49:53.202
with one year's honorarium
in grateful recognition

49:53.785 --> 49:55.329
of your holy service.

50:02.085 --> 50:04.880
-This will not stand.
-Ferik.

50:05.464 --> 50:08.425
You should know better.

50:43.502 --> 50:44.837
Baba Voss.

50:46.505 --> 50:48.507
Your heavy gait gives you away, Baba.

50:49.716 --> 50:50.717
Harlan.

50:51.802 --> 50:55.931
I wanted to express my gratitude
to you for protecting my city.

50:57.140 --> 50:58.851
Your city?

50:58.934 --> 51:03.105
Well… Yeah, I built it, bled for it.
So I'd say it's mine.

51:04.648 --> 51:06.108
Whatever gives you peace.

51:07.109 --> 51:08.151
Baba, wait.

51:09.486 --> 51:12.155
You would be a great asset
to the Payan army.

51:12.239 --> 51:13.532
I'm not a soldier.

51:13.615 --> 51:15.868
Well, you might surprise yourself.

51:16.952 --> 51:18.579
This war isn't over, Baba.

51:24.710 --> 51:25.919
It is for me.

51:38.223 --> 51:40.017
How many Witchfinders did we lose?

51:41.143 --> 51:44.188
Twenty-two… today.

51:45.898 --> 51:47.816
So, not that many.

51:49.902 --> 51:55.032
As Witchfinder General,
Ferik had some measure of influence.

51:57.743 --> 51:59.786
He'll recruit more.

52:00.746 --> 52:02.206
Will they be a problem?

52:02.789 --> 52:04.041
Undoubtedly.

52:05.209 --> 52:06.793
But not immediately.

52:08.921 --> 52:10.422
You sound tired.

52:12.466 --> 52:14.426
You try serving your sister for 20 years.

52:18.555 --> 52:23.143
Well, I hope I can make
the next 20 years a little easier.

52:26.396 --> 52:30.317
I think my days of service
have finally come to an end.

52:33.028 --> 52:36.114
Tamacti, Paya needs you.

52:36.198 --> 52:38.659
-They have you.
-I need you.

52:42.454 --> 52:43.705
I'll consider it.

52:49.044 --> 52:50.170
Thank you.

52:52.464 --> 52:54.925
Your command of the council is inspiring.

52:59.179 --> 53:04.810
You are your father's daughter
in every way.

53:08.730 --> 53:12.526
You will truly be a great queen.

53:15.529 --> 53:19.700
And Paya will have the leader it deserves.

53:22.661 --> 53:26.248
Everything's gonna be all right

53:26.957 --> 53:31.461
Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye

53:33.463 --> 53:38.677
Everything's gonna be all right

53:38.760 --> 53:45.184
Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye

53:47.186 --> 53:52.107
Everything's gonna be all right

53:52.191 --> 53:59.072
Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye

53:59.823 --> 54:01.575
Rock-a-bye

54:06.288 --> 54:07.289
Oloman.

54:08.999 --> 54:11.251
You have a demonstration for me.

54:13.295 --> 54:14.129
Yes.

54:15.130 --> 54:18.342
Let's hope for your sake this one goes
better than your last attempt.

54:20.427 --> 54:21.595
It will.

54:23.096 --> 54:24.389
Get on with it.

54:52.751 --> 54:55.337
You're testing my patience.

54:56.129 --> 54:57.256
Wait for it.

59:11.844 --> 59:14.346
The guard said
you were crying out in your sleep.

59:14.972 --> 59:16.890
A presage as a midwife.

59:18.976 --> 59:20.394
For many years now.

59:22.145 --> 59:23.647
Describe what you are feeling.

59:26.775 --> 59:28.277
The pain of motherhood.

59:29.695 --> 59:31.613
It is early yet for that.

59:37.703 --> 59:39.079
Let me examine you.

59:56.138 --> 59:59.975
How odd, you being so concerned for me.

1:00:00.058 --> 1:00:02.603
My concern lies with the child.

1:00:09.109 --> 1:00:10.861
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

1:00:10.944 --> 1:00:12.863
Your womb is intact.

1:00:15.157 --> 1:00:17.242
This baby will come on its birth day.

1:00:18.202 --> 1:00:23.248
Maghra says this child will never know me.

1:00:25.167 --> 1:00:27.085
You're a midwife, Paris. Surely you agree,

1:00:27.169 --> 1:00:29.630
a child should never be taken
from its true mother.

1:00:31.507 --> 1:00:35.469
It is not my place
to question the intentions of the queen.

1:00:35.552 --> 1:00:36.970
No, of course not.

1:00:40.098 --> 1:00:42.309
You can't really expect Kofun
to raise a child.

1:00:42.392 --> 1:00:43.936
He's practically one himself.

1:00:44.019 --> 1:00:46.063
He is very much a man.

1:00:47.439 --> 1:00:49.483
And he's much stronger than you know.

1:01:04.581 --> 1:01:05.707
Will you help him?

1:01:07.584 --> 1:01:10.671
Of course I will help Kofun.

1:01:15.551 --> 1:01:17.052
No, you won't.

1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:21.723
And hear this, mountain woman.

1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:27.729
I will kill this child
before I let it be taken.

1:01:29.523 --> 1:01:31.191
And I'll kill anyone who tries.

1:01:36.405 --> 1:01:38.490
Everything is gonna be all right.

1:01:41.076 --> 1:01:42.578
Rock-a-bye

1:01:44.705 --> 1:01:46.290
Rock-a-bye

1:01:49.126 --> 1:01:50.961
Rock-a-bye.
