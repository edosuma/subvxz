WEBVTT

00:04.512 --> 00:06.851
ER

00:07.052 --> 00:08.340
Previously on ER...

00:08.341 --> 00:10.185
- Want a bite?
- No, I'll just watch you eat it.

00:10.186 --> 00:11.629
- Where is that going?
- What do you mean?

00:11.630 --> 00:13.243
- You and the desk clerk.
- Do you think your grand mother...

00:13.244 --> 00:15.929
- would consider this clinic idea?
- She'd probably look at it.

00:15.930 --> 00:18.550
I have to pay my landlord,
the med school bills,

00:18.551 --> 00:21.736
my phone bill, the gas bill,
that should leave me about four bucks.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.294
- Oh, yeah, me too.
- You've not worked...

00:23.295 --> 00:25.450
- with Dr. Romano, have you?
- Rocket Romano?

00:25.451 --> 00:26.999
Rocket's sponsoring my BTA.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.892
Damn you people!

00:28.893 --> 00:30.531
- Hold him down!
- Son of a bitch!

00:30.832 --> 00:31.954
That's enough!

00:31.955 --> 00:33.970
Believe me, it won't get any better.

00:33.971 --> 00:35.371
He belongs in jail.

00:35.372 --> 00:37.257
I wish it was me who kicked
your white ass!

00:37.615 --> 00:40.338
"Ground Zero"

00:45.336 --> 00:47.297
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.383
No. I smelled the coffee.

00:49.592 --> 00:52.179
Well, let me get you a cup.

00:52.387 --> 00:53.556
Okay.

00:55.558 --> 00:57.478
You're cheerful this morning.

00:58.563 --> 01:00.148
Did you talk to the foreman yet?

01:00.358 --> 01:03.362
Yeah. He gave me
the same old, same old.

01:03.570 --> 01:05.072
All crewed up.

01:05.406 --> 01:07.033
But I talked to Tommy Styles.

01:07.242 --> 01:09.078
Tommy?
I thought he moved to Atlanta.

01:09.244 --> 01:13.959
Yeah. He's a general manager of
a construction company down there...

01:14.169 --> 01:17.173
...and got some contracts
during the Olympics.

01:19.343 --> 01:21.262
And things just grew from there.

01:22.347 --> 01:24.558
They can't get enough guys
to fill their gigs.

01:24.767 --> 01:26.394
- Good for him.
- Yeah.

01:26.603 --> 01:29.440
He said...
He said a guy with my skills...

01:29.607 --> 01:33.571
...could make some real good money
the first year out.

01:34.614 --> 01:35.699
In Atlanta?

01:35.908 --> 01:39.830
Yeah. I mean, it could be
a chance for a fresh start.

01:40.414 --> 01:42.292
Better job opportunities.

01:42.501 --> 01:43.835
Better weather.

01:44.253 --> 01:46.673
We already know Tommy.
My sister's down there.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.677
And it's a chocolate city,
so socially-

01:49.886 --> 01:52.640
- Sounds great.
- But?

01:52.848 --> 01:55.520
But we're not kids anymore.
We can't just start over.

01:55.728 --> 01:59.149
Why not? Why can't we
just wipe the slate clean?

01:59.358 --> 02:01.528
Because we have a mortgage
and I have a job.

02:02.530 --> 02:03.822
But I don't.

02:04.866 --> 02:07.411
I'm being frozen out up here.

02:08.037 --> 02:11.751
And after that fight with Bill,
I can't just hang out...

02:11.960 --> 02:14.380
...watch a football game
with the guys.

02:15.005 --> 02:17.926
My life is over up here.

02:18.259 --> 02:23.226
In Atlanta, we wouldn't have
to tell anybody. Nobody would know.

02:27.732 --> 02:30.986
Hey, how many patients do you
think we see every year?

02:31.195 --> 02:32.280
Too many.

02:32.489 --> 02:35.785
Could you be a little more specific?
It's for my grant proposal.

02:35.993 --> 02:39.374
Tonight's the Carter Family
Foundation night. You nervous?

02:39.582 --> 02:43.212
No, the worst she'll say is no, and
I'm back to clueless and penniless.

02:43.420 --> 02:44.589
- Good morning.
- Hey.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.924
You in a good mood?

02:46.092 --> 02:48.929
The hospital settled
the Kenny Law malpractice suit.

02:49.096 --> 02:51.891
No more process servers.
No more depositions.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.144
And after today, no more work...

02:54.353 --> 02:57.650
...because I've got three days
of vacation time before me.

02:57.858 --> 02:58.901
Any plans?

02:59.110 --> 03:01.113
Sleep, sleep and sleep.

03:01.321 --> 03:03.699
Mark, how many patients do we
see here every year?

03:03.908 --> 03:06.703
Would that be real patients
or turkeys?

03:07.121 --> 03:08.206
Forget I asked.

03:08.414 --> 03:13.338
Your count will be about 95 percent
higher if you count all the wackos.

03:13.631 --> 03:14.674
It's a little harsh.

03:14.882 --> 03:16.802
All right, I'll make you a wager.

03:17.803 --> 03:21.350
A wager on the turkey-to-patient
ratio over the next 12 hours.

03:21.558 --> 03:22.978
- No, thanks.
- Two-1 odds.

03:23.186 --> 03:24.813
Can I get a doctor quickly?

03:25.021 --> 03:27.108
Help, please! Anyone!

03:27.400 --> 03:31.030
See? Here's a real patient now.
You're already up by one.

03:33.992 --> 03:35.078
Anna?

03:36.705 --> 03:38.332
- Anna?
- Hey, Carter.

03:38.541 --> 03:40.001
I'm running late. Sorry.

03:40.168 --> 03:42.755
I misread your handwriting.
I thought this said 4D.

03:42.964 --> 03:44.049
It does.

03:45.008 --> 03:46.553
Come in.

03:47.512 --> 03:50.057
I had to get my shower in
before the guy in 4G.

03:50.266 --> 03:53.521
He stands in there for an hour
listening to Howard Stern.

03:53.729 --> 03:55.524
Can I get a ride to Journal Club?

03:56.024 --> 03:58.236
- Sure.
- Thanks.

03:59.529 --> 04:03.201
Make yourself comfortable.
I'm gonna go get dressed.

04:10.086 --> 04:11.547
This is a nice place.

04:12.589 --> 04:15.635
Please, it's a dump.
But you get what you pay for, right?

04:15.803 --> 04:18.223
What can you do?
Especially on what we're paid.

04:18.390 --> 04:19.558
Right.

04:20.392 --> 04:23.856
If you want, there's some
Pop-Tarts on the counter.

04:30.365 --> 04:32.743
Can I make you one?

04:32.952 --> 04:34.913
No, it's okay. I like them cold.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.333
- Me too.
- Really?

04:39.000 --> 04:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:47.472 --> 04:49.976
Damn landlord won't fumigate
the place.

04:50.185 --> 04:52.437
I write letters,
call the management office.

04:52.647 --> 04:56.277
Bet he doesn't have roaches
around his fat-cat estates.

04:56.485 --> 04:59.782
Report him to the health department.
Roaches are a health hazard.

04:59.991 --> 05:01.534
Really? That works?
You tried it?

05:02.077 --> 05:03.120
Yeah.

05:03.287 --> 05:06.834
I never would have pegged you for
a guy who knew slumlord politics.

05:07.042 --> 05:08.795
You seem so milk-fed middle-class.

05:09.004 --> 05:12.341
You know, my family always
had enough to get by.

05:12.550 --> 05:14.219
Never went hungry or anything.

05:14.636 --> 05:17.306
Let's go over this journal
stuff at breakfast.

05:17.473 --> 05:20.311
I know a place that's got
a $1.99 pancake special.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.688
- You buying?
- My treat.

05:21.896 --> 05:24.316
All right. Thanks.

06:17.906 --> 06:21.744
- Type and cross for 4 units.
- X-ray. AP and lateral on that knee.

06:21.952 --> 06:24.247
- What happened?
- A performance piece-

06:24.456 --> 06:28.711
I did "William Tell," taking the risk
that the average Philistine wouldn't.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.674
All this idiot had to do was shoot
the apple from in between my legs.

06:32.841 --> 06:35.761
- Lucky he didn't aim higher.
- It makes it even edgier.

06:35.969 --> 06:38.640
- You shed blood for your work.
- Are you Max Prole?

06:38.849 --> 06:42.478
No. It's just, the blood on the gallery wall
made a bold splatter-

06:42.686 --> 06:46.274
- Do I look like Jackson Pollock?
- I'm sorry, sir. I just think-

06:46.483 --> 06:48.194
Carol, let's give him
10 of morphine.

06:48.402 --> 06:51.697
Wait. The piece can go on and
live and breathe on its own.

06:51.864 --> 06:52.949
I will be the canvas.

06:53.158 --> 06:55.243
No morphine.
Experience the sensation.

06:55.452 --> 06:58.289
You have a bullet hole in your leg.
Now take the drug.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.626
Sorry, Carol. Score one for me.

07:04.172 --> 07:06.466
When is Dr. Hicks doing
her 8 a. m. gastroplasty?

07:06.674 --> 07:07.717
- Did.
- Excuse me?

07:07.884 --> 07:10.345
She pushed it up to 6.
They should be done by now.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.223
Hey, what's going on?

07:12.389 --> 07:15.142
- Finishing up my note.
- Dr. Hicks changed her surgery?

07:15.351 --> 07:18.022
She made rounds for Dr. Sloman.
You weren't here yet.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.733
- Why wasn't I called?
- I didn't want to disturb you.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.276
That was my gastroplasty.

07:22.486 --> 07:25.405
I know. But you have limited time
with your family, so...

07:25.572 --> 07:27.116
Is that what you told Dr. Hicks?

07:27.325 --> 07:30.787
Peter, I thought I was doing you a favor.
If you think I wanted this-

07:30.953 --> 07:32.414
Hey, did you?

07:32.581 --> 07:36.419
Look, why don't you take my ischemic
bowel at 11, and we'll call it a trade.

07:36.628 --> 07:39.088
- Okay, yeah. Why don't we do that.
- Good.

07:39.255 --> 07:42.510
You smell like talcum powder.
That's so sweet.

07:44.011 --> 07:46.139
Hey, Jeanie. Your husband called.

07:46.306 --> 07:48.850
- Did he leave a message?
- Yeah, I wrote it down.

07:49.142 --> 07:53.731
"Mint juleps, night-blooming jasmine
and warm southern breezes. "

07:53.981 --> 07:56.903
- That was it?
- Yeah. He sounds like a real romantic.

07:57.111 --> 07:59.489
Sometimes I wish he wasn't
as much of a romantic.

07:59.656 --> 08:01.575
You don't like
being swept off your feet?

08:01.742 --> 08:04.745
- It's the landing that's a problem.
- This Synergix Group...

08:04.912 --> 08:07.290
Its balanced budget's deeper
in the red than ours.

08:07.457 --> 08:09.542
- I've made real progress.
- That's laudable.

08:09.751 --> 08:12.838
- But hear what they have to say.
- What if I don't like it?

08:13.048 --> 08:14.256
I'd plan on liking it.

08:14.465 --> 08:18.595
Or you can explain to the board
of directors the ER's massive deficit.

08:18.762 --> 08:21.599
They're looking for scapegoats.
Don't be one.

08:21.807 --> 08:24.686
It was a complete accident.
Mr. Prole made me do it.

08:24.895 --> 08:27.231
- This is your guy.
- A couple of questions.

08:27.649 --> 08:29.651
I was a bad shot. He wouldn't listen!

08:29.817 --> 08:32.946
- Gotta love the crackpots.
- Can you cover me for a few hours?

08:33.111 --> 08:35.616
Anspaugh's sending me
to some dog-and-pony show...

08:35.783 --> 08:37.577
...for these ER management groups.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.664
- If I have to.
- He just zeroed in on the budget.

08:40.873 --> 08:45.002
Said we're overstaffed, ordering too
many tests. He wants it turned around.

08:45.212 --> 08:47.172
- Sounds bad.
- There's no money.

08:47.380 --> 08:49.508
Resources are stretched as it is.

08:49.717 --> 08:51.969
He still wants me to lose another 98,000.

08:52.179 --> 08:53.971
- Something's gotta give.
- Yeah.

08:54.180 --> 08:56.350
I just don't know what or who.

08:56.558 --> 08:58.310
Let me know when you're back.

08:59.020 --> 09:01.398
- What have you got?
- Matthew Lindermulder.

09:01.607 --> 09:05.444
His spotter at the gym dropped
a free-weight bar on his head.

09:05.653 --> 09:07.863
Now I know why I let
my gym membership lapse.

09:08.030 --> 09:10.283
BP's 120/80. Pulse 88.

09:10.493 --> 09:13.913
- Pupils equal, round and reactive.
- Babinski's down-going.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.457
He withdraws to pain.

09:15.665 --> 09:19.962
Okay. Let's get a CBC, cross-table
C- spine, and a non-contrast head CT.

09:20.171 --> 09:22.465
- Oh, man.
- What's that?

09:22.882 --> 09:24.218
It's a Klan tattoo.

09:26.679 --> 09:28.597
Can you hear me?
How long was he seizing?

09:28.806 --> 09:31.059
His cellmates screamed
for us an hour ago.

09:31.227 --> 09:33.353
All the way here.
It stopped as we pulled up.

09:33.521 --> 09:36.191
BP's 100/70. Pulse 100.

09:38.026 --> 09:40.070
- Has he been here before?
- Don't know.

09:40.236 --> 09:42.949
- Wet himself in the van on the way.
- Okay.

09:44.158 --> 09:47.161
- Can you not use those cuffs?
- Okay, but I gotta stay with him.

09:47.329 --> 09:48.413
He's waking up!

09:50.666 --> 09:52.251
I hear it ringing.

09:54.254 --> 09:55.964
- Any history of epilepsy?
- No.

09:56.173 --> 09:58.550
- I smell rubber.
- How are you feeling there?

09:58.760 --> 10:00.595
I don't know. I don't know.

10:00.804 --> 10:03.432
Hang on. Hang on.
That's all right. Hang on.

10:03.641 --> 10:04.767
He's bit his tongue.

10:05.936 --> 10:08.772
Get a head CT and a tox screen.
Can I talk to you outside?

10:08.939 --> 10:09.981
Sure.

10:14.612 --> 10:17.031
- What do you think?
- Textbook seizure symptoms.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.827
- A little too textbook.
- A convincing performance.

10:20.036 --> 10:24.291
I've seen Oscar-winning performances
for a "Get out of Jail Free" card.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.543
Maybe Mark Greene's rubbing off on us.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.295
He's seizing again.

10:29.381 --> 10:31.633
The labs are back
on that weird guy in 1.

10:31.841 --> 10:34.970
- Anna, weird guy in 1.
- Okay.

10:35.137 --> 10:36.972
- Thanks again for breakfast.
- Sure.

10:37.181 --> 10:40.144
- Could you wrap up a patient for me?
- Is he stinky?

10:40.353 --> 10:43.564
No. A straightforward concussion.
Just makes me uncomfortable.

10:43.773 --> 10:46.901
You're passing him off because
he makes you feel uncomfortable?

10:47.110 --> 10:50.156
Dr. Carter? It's the lab.

10:50.614 --> 10:53.869
- He's a member of the Ku Klux Klan.
- Did he make any remarks?

10:54.078 --> 10:58.415
No. He's unconscious.
But I noticed he had a KKK tattoo.

10:58.625 --> 11:03.004
If we all waited for the perfect patient,
the lounge would be standing-room only.

11:03.214 --> 11:07.385
Any problem, call security. Until then,
try and remember Hippocrates.

11:09.012 --> 11:10.972
No pupil dilation.

11:11.681 --> 11:14.393
Oral mucosa's intact.

11:16.187 --> 11:17.356
Lucky landing.

11:17.564 --> 11:19.359
Sorry, officer, it doesn't look good.

11:19.526 --> 11:22.362
Will you prepare the H20-Na
treatment, please?

11:22.529 --> 11:24.198
Doctor, that's experimental.

11:24.365 --> 11:27.326
- What doesn't look good?
- Well, it's our only hope.

11:27.701 --> 11:31.623
Officer, do you have the name
of Mr. Steiff's next of kin?

11:31.831 --> 11:36.420
Either he'll snap out of it, or he'll
be forced into an irreversible coma.

11:36.587 --> 11:37.631
Coma?

11:37.839 --> 11:40.926
Wait a few seconds. If it doesn't
work, call the coma team.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.137
What? What? Who?

11:44.764 --> 11:46.557
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.310
- Saltwater.
- Where am I?

11:48.519 --> 11:50.187
Right now, you're in a hospital...

11:50.395 --> 11:53.441
...but you'll soon be on a bus
headed for prison...

11:53.859 --> 11:55.276
...in very wet pants.

11:59.490 --> 12:02.494
We got your Gram's stain back,
Mr. La Fontaine.

12:02.744 --> 12:05.373
Please, for you, Vinnie.

12:05.581 --> 12:07.626
Okay, Vinnie. You have gonorrhea.

12:08.293 --> 12:11.088
From your chart,
you're familiar with the protocol.

12:11.296 --> 12:15.176
Occupational hazard.
Price of being a player.

12:15.426 --> 12:17.429
- You sing?
- No.

12:17.596 --> 12:19.765
That's a damn shame because...

12:20.432 --> 12:24.854
...I've been in the entertainment industry
for numerous years.

12:25.063 --> 12:28.776
And with a face like yours,
you could sell a lot of platters.

12:28.943 --> 12:31.780
This is a single dose
of Floxin and Zithromax.

12:31.988 --> 12:35.159
They do the same thing as
the antibiotics you're used to.

12:35.451 --> 12:38.205
I remember when it used to be
an elephant gun...

12:38.413 --> 12:40.707
...of penicillin in the ass.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.794
Have you been tested recently
for HIV or syphilis?

12:43.961 --> 12:48.675
Oh, yeah, I get tested at Southside Clinic.
I am clean and pristine.

12:51.011 --> 12:52.430
- Is the coast clear?
- What?

12:52.639 --> 12:55.308
Fake seizure kid.
I'd rather Dr. Greene not see him.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.562
Not a patient I should bring up
to your grandmother, right?

12:58.771 --> 13:02.150
Oh, jeez! Your clinic proposal.
That's tonight, isn't it?

13:02.317 --> 13:04.361
Yeah, Oak Park, 7:00.
That's what we said.

13:04.569 --> 13:06.489
Yeah, we did. I just spaced it.

13:06.697 --> 13:08.991
I made plans with Anna.
I can change them.

13:09.158 --> 13:11.495
- Plans with Anna?
- Yeah, Journal Club.

13:11.662 --> 13:14.039
- So it's a colleague kind of thing?
- So far.

13:14.249 --> 13:16.961
You got all your facts and figures?
Gamma loves those.

13:17.169 --> 13:20.714
- Just waiting for census numbers.
- That's cool. You'll do fine.

13:20.881 --> 13:24.010
Don't talk politics or religion
and you'll stay on her good side.

13:24.177 --> 13:25.220
Politics, religion.

13:25.387 --> 13:28.391
Or baseball. She's pissed off
over that inter-league play.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.977
- Anything else?
- No. You're a natural.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.522
How long has your wrist hurt?

13:32.729 --> 13:34.564
About two weeks. Think it might be-

13:34.774 --> 13:36.567
- I'll take a look.
- Can you hold this?

13:36.776 --> 13:39.237
- I'll just set it down-
- Consider yourself served.

13:39.446 --> 13:41.156
- Excuse me?
- If you have questions...

13:41.323 --> 13:44.202
- ... an attorney's number is inside.
- Too late, bud.

13:44.410 --> 13:49.208
This case was settled. But I have
a suggestion of where to stick this.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.378
- Another process server?
- Unbelievable.

13:51.586 --> 13:54.089
Impersonating a patient.
That's gotta be illegal.

13:54.297 --> 13:56.217
They should get their story straight.

13:56.425 --> 13:59.887
Mark, it's not a malpractice summons.
It's a civil suit.

14:00.097 --> 14:01.139
- What?
- Yeah.

14:01.348 --> 14:04.727
Chris Law's claiming you violated
his brother's civil rights.

14:04.936 --> 14:07.855
He's not suing the hospital.
He's suing you.

14:12.361 --> 14:14.697
So I think the facts speak
for themselves.

14:14.864 --> 14:17.367
When you partner
with Synergix Physicians' Group...

14:17.575 --> 14:19.411
...we will increase revenues...

14:19.620 --> 14:22.957
...streamline management
and cut costs...

14:23.166 --> 14:27.045
...making your department
a center of excellence.

14:27.545 --> 14:30.926
I'm sure that some of you
have questions. So- Yes, sir.

14:31.134 --> 14:33.261
Eric Norris,
director of St. Joseph's ER-

14:33.470 --> 14:36.723
The principal author on thrombolytics
and pulmonary embolism...

14:36.933 --> 14:38.643
...in the September Annals.
Welcome.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.480
Yes. What are your billing charges?

14:41.689 --> 14:44.275
Now, that is the beauty
of the SPG system.

14:44.484 --> 14:49.740
Collective billing of 125 facilities
enables us to keep billing costs...

14:49.907 --> 14:51.826
...down below 5 percent.

14:53.161 --> 14:56.706
- Yes?
- I have a few questions. The first-

14:56.873 --> 14:58.125
I'm sorry. And you are?

14:58.292 --> 15:01.295
Kerry Weaver, Chief of Emergency
Services at County General.

15:01.462 --> 15:03.257
Five percent is an impressive number.

15:03.423 --> 15:07.011
But what's the actual percentage
Synergix retains in management fees?

15:07.220 --> 15:10.599
We retain the current
physicians' salaries.

15:10.807 --> 15:14.896
We balance your budget by maximizing
reimbursement and cutting costs.

15:15.105 --> 15:18.776
I'm sure you've heard of the Pentagon
and the $5,000 hammer-

15:18.943 --> 15:20.945
Yeah, I'm not talking about hammers.

15:21.153 --> 15:24.533
And you haven't answered
my question, Mr. West.

15:26.243 --> 15:30.207
Well, it's Dr. West.
But please call me Ellis.

15:30.706 --> 15:34.754
The number you're looking for is
dependent upon a multitude of factors.

15:35.213 --> 15:39.843
Payer mix, daily census, physician
reimbursement, just to name a few.

15:40.343 --> 15:42.471
But we should talk about this later.

15:42.680 --> 15:46.142
Right now I'd like to answer a few
more questions, if I may. Yes?

15:46.309 --> 15:47.394
In the back.

15:47.602 --> 15:50.398
- Dr. Romano.
- Lizzie, just the person I wanted to see.

15:50.606 --> 15:52.358
Someone will be limping for a while.

15:52.566 --> 15:55.987
Some wacky artist got shot.
Completely imploded his cartilage.

15:56.196 --> 15:59.033
There's a cylindrical defect
to the femoral condyle.

15:59.242 --> 16:02.121
You called it.
Perfect candidate for your research.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.415
He's all yours if you got the time.

16:04.624 --> 16:08.002
I have, but we'd need to get his
consent, look for a donor femur.

16:08.211 --> 16:10.964
Consent's taken care of.
And I trolled the morgue.

16:11.173 --> 16:14.718
Found a femur that matches. All you
need to do is grow culture cells.

16:14.927 --> 16:16.513
An osteochondral allograft.

16:16.680 --> 16:21.185
I didn't think I'd ever get to do one.
I'll start the cultures right away.

16:21.644 --> 16:24.647
- Thank you so much.
- Who looks out for you, huh?

16:26.608 --> 16:28.486
I talked to Ivan Sheldon.
Remember him?

16:28.653 --> 16:31.656
A night court judge from Evanston
with a 6 handicap.

16:31.824 --> 16:36.161
He gave me the name of a good attorney.
He defended the civil-rights case...

16:36.371 --> 16:39.624
...against the Kallenback
Meatpacking Company.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.962
You're discussing my legal problems
with golfing buddies?

16:43.170 --> 16:44.380
Sheldon is a judge.

16:44.588 --> 16:48.052
I didn't ask you to save my ass,
or whatever it is you're trying to do.

16:48.219 --> 16:51.305
I'm trying to be your friend,
which is tougher to do these days.

16:51.472 --> 16:54.350
Mark, that environmental-allergy
woman is waiting.

16:54.517 --> 16:55.560
And why is that?

16:55.769 --> 16:58.773
You've been in a bad mood.
I don't know how to talk to you.

16:58.981 --> 17:00.858
- Then don't.
- Okay.

17:04.113 --> 17:07.617
What's the statute of limitations
on posttraumatic stress?

17:07.826 --> 17:09.243
Cut him some slack.

17:09.411 --> 17:11.747
We've all cut him plenty.
He needs some help.

17:11.914 --> 17:14.791
He needs friends who are supportive.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.755
He's not gonna have any friends
if he keeps this up.

17:17.964 --> 17:20.590
- Your guy is back from CT.
- The grand wizard.

17:20.758 --> 17:24.220
He's regained consciousness.
Needs a scalp and shoulder suture.

17:24.428 --> 17:27.433
- He'll be cross-burning in no time.
- I hate to say it, but...

17:27.642 --> 17:29.852
...he's actually very polite.

17:32.356 --> 17:34.274
You're gonna need sutures.

17:34.483 --> 17:37.529
Now you're gonna make me look like
Frankenstein's monster, huh?

17:37.737 --> 17:40.031
First your shoulder.
Please lower your gown.

17:40.950 --> 17:45.079
Could the nurse do them? That little
blond lady who was in here before?

17:45.288 --> 17:48.125
It's not her job.
You'll have to settle for me.

17:48.875 --> 17:51.129
It's no offense. It's just...

17:52.130 --> 17:53.214
Go ahead.

17:58.929 --> 18:01.725
- I gotta hand it to you people.
- "You people"?

18:01.934 --> 18:05.104
Paramedics, nurses,
physicians' assistants.

18:05.312 --> 18:07.940
A dumb ox like me gets a barbell
dropped on his head...

18:08.148 --> 18:09.985
...and I get the best care on Earth.

18:10.151 --> 18:11.904
Well, we treat everybody here.

18:14.115 --> 18:17.077
- Have you been saved, Miss...?
- Boulet.

18:18.328 --> 18:19.831
Do you walk with the Lord?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.209
What's that tattoo have to do
with the Lord?

18:24.795 --> 18:26.588
I'm sorry you had to see it.

18:26.798 --> 18:31.595
That's why I asked for the nurse.
It's a reminder of what I left behind.

18:31.804 --> 18:34.223
Intolerance, ignorance, hate.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.351
I was reborn through
the love of Jesus Christ.

18:38.603 --> 18:40.397
I've built a new life.

18:40.940 --> 18:43.025
You don't believe that's possible, do you?

18:44.735 --> 18:45.946
Sure I do.

18:48.782 --> 18:50.660
We didn't finish our discussion.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.413
I think I heard everything
I need to hear.

18:53.621 --> 18:55.290
But I haven't.

18:55.457 --> 18:59.045
Listen, Kerry, I'm surrounded
by number-crunchers all day long.

18:59.254 --> 19:02.382
When an intelligent and
attractive woman walks in...

19:02.590 --> 19:06.012
- ... I must ask her to lunch.
- Yeah. I have to get back to work.

19:06.221 --> 19:09.057
I'll tell Chicago not to get sick
for an hour.

19:09.474 --> 19:14.105
We'll go to the Oak Room, and I'll tell
you my dirty management secrets.

19:15.983 --> 19:20.113
- and the Japanese strain of staph is
resistant to the most powerful antibiotics.

19:20.321 --> 19:21.571
- Scary stuff.
- Yeah.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.491
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

19:23.658 --> 19:26.202
- What are you doing?
- There are germs, doctor.

19:26.412 --> 19:27.871
You can put that away now.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.417
Dr. Greene is very sanitary.
Don't worry.

19:30.625 --> 19:33.421
- I'll be the judge of that.
- Take off the mask.

19:33.629 --> 19:38.051
This is a charcoal-filter mask. 20 percent
of people get sicker in the hospital.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.555
I don't wanna become
another statistic.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.933
You're complaining of fatigue,
dry mouth, shortness of breath.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.853
Heart rate's 130. Resps 32.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.857
You've been here before
for anxiety attacks.

19:50.066 --> 19:53.528
This is not an anxiety attack.
I'm allergic to my apartment building.

19:53.736 --> 19:57.408
- Why don't you move?
- Is that your medical opinion, doctor?

19:58.200 --> 20:00.203
I have environmentally based
allergies!

20:00.412 --> 20:02.956
Or you're looking
for a little attention.

20:03.164 --> 20:04.208
Mark.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.879
Why don't you get a blood gas
and call me with the results.

20:09.715 --> 20:13.511
I see Dr. Corday handed you off
one nasty ileum.

20:13.719 --> 20:15.805
I'm just helping her out.

20:16.974 --> 20:19.894
I'm glad that you two
have some camaraderie.

20:20.561 --> 20:24.233
- It will come in handy with Dr. Romano.
- Excuse me?

20:24.441 --> 20:28.362
He's looking for another surgeon
for his team and...

20:29.072 --> 20:30.155
...I recommended you.

20:30.364 --> 20:32.742
Well, thank you. But- Stapler.

20:33.953 --> 20:35.078
Thanks but what?

20:35.287 --> 20:39.584
I'm more interested in working with
surgeons who challenge my skills...

20:39.751 --> 20:43.506
- ... than dazzle me with technology.
- Technology is the new technique.

20:43.715 --> 20:46.426
And if you don't master it,
somebody else will.

20:48.846 --> 20:51.766
When I saw how the flaws
in the system trickled down...

20:51.933 --> 20:55.436
...and affected the day-to-day
operations of an ER...

20:55.645 --> 20:59.067
- ... I knew I should be in management.
- Then you got your MBA.

20:59.276 --> 21:01.778
And then up the corporate ladder.
Blah, blah, blah.

21:01.987 --> 21:04.407
I didn't kidnap you
out of that conference...

21:04.614 --> 21:07.410
...to tell you my life story.

21:07.619 --> 21:09.453
I wanna find out more about you.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.665
Pick your brain a little bit.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.794
Grapevine says you're doing
great things.

21:14.961 --> 21:16.504
I don't know about great.

21:16.713 --> 21:20.134
My spies tell me about your
waste-reduction program.

21:20.342 --> 21:22.971
Yeah, well, saving a syringe
and some gauze...

21:23.179 --> 21:25.640
...is not the dent
my bosses are looking for.

21:25.933 --> 21:28.812
Sounds serious.
You wanna bend my ear?

21:28.978 --> 21:30.146
Maybe I can help.

21:30.312 --> 21:33.151
The board is convening
at the end of the week.

21:33.317 --> 21:35.026
- That's tomorrow.
- Don't remind me.

21:35.194 --> 21:38.823
They need to cut 10 percent of
the budget. We're already to the bone.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.660
Are they making suggestions
or handing you the ax?

21:41.827 --> 21:45.665
They figure I can chop 8 percent by firing
half of the physicians' assistants.

21:45.832 --> 21:48.876
- That's not a bad idea.
- On paper maybe.

21:49.253 --> 21:51.673
Not so great if you have to
fire a friend.

21:53.174 --> 21:55.677
So this is about more than
just the bottom line.

21:57.012 --> 21:59.223
Well, it's never easy
letting people go, Kerry.

22:01.393 --> 22:03.854
But there are ways
to make it less painful...

22:04.354 --> 22:06.357
...and sometimes less permanent.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.695
Shall we get some coffee?

22:11.238 --> 22:12.282
Sure.

22:12.448 --> 22:16.411
With what I have waiting for me,
I'm in no rush to get back.

22:17.371 --> 22:21.083
Do you think people are capable of
change? Starting their lives over?

22:21.293 --> 22:22.877
- Yeah, sure. Why not?
- I did.

22:24.212 --> 22:27.008
I used to have deadbeat jobs
and go out with loser guys.

22:27.174 --> 22:28.384
Now look at me.

22:28.592 --> 22:30.679
Did the blood gas come up
on that germ lady?

22:30.887 --> 22:32.347
Yeah. In Curtain 2.

22:32.556 --> 22:35.768
Dr. Greene, she seemed a little
upset when she left.

22:35.977 --> 22:37.521
Wanted to get out of here.

22:37.728 --> 22:39.857
- She left before the test results?
- Yeah.

22:40.023 --> 22:44.069
She made a quick call, sprayed the phone
with disinfectant and walked out.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.532
- She left AMA.
- Why would she do that?

22:46.699 --> 22:49.368
Maybe because Mark was rude,
dismissive and patronizing.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.037
I'm sure that's not true.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.955
Not my job to be
their best friend.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.375
No. Just their caregiver.

22:58.129 --> 22:59.422
What's all the brouha?

22:59.630 --> 23:03.760
Dr. Romano and Dr. Corday are doing
an osteochondral allograft.

23:03.969 --> 23:08.016
Well, hot damn.
That's our first ever here at County.

23:08.224 --> 23:12.229
Even Channel Five News is here
covering it for the sci-tech segment.

23:13.313 --> 23:15.191
See what I mean, Peter?

23:15.692 --> 23:18.236
The future is now.

23:24.077 --> 23:25.161
Excuse me.

23:26.122 --> 23:27.581
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sorry.

23:27.790 --> 23:28.875
Excuse me.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.056
Vincent Scarletti, 82,
found in his bathroom.

23:41.265 --> 23:43.893
He was in full arrest.
We shocked him twice...

23:44.060 --> 23:45.937
...got a rhythm and a pulse.

23:46.397 --> 23:49.442
How long between the time
you found your husband...

23:49.650 --> 23:51.735
- ... and the paramedics arrived?
- What?

23:51.902 --> 23:56.366
- She's hard of hearing.
- How long was he unconscious?

23:56.575 --> 23:59.662
Oh, I don't know.
Ten minutes, 15 maybe.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.956
He was here two weeks ago.
They said he was fine.

24:02.123 --> 24:06.087
We'll do everything we can.
On my count. One. Two. Three.

24:07.505 --> 24:08.798
BP's 80/50.

24:09.007 --> 24:10.968
- Pulse ox 90. Pulse is 48.
- All right.

24:11.175 --> 24:14.806
Start dopamine, titrate
to a systolic of 100.

24:15.015 --> 24:17.434
Atropine 0.5 mgs.

24:17.600 --> 24:21.022
His pupils are fixed and dilated.
No deep tendon reflexes.

24:21.230 --> 24:24.776
Carol, get a CBC, Chem-7, EKG,
blood gas and a portable chest.

24:24.985 --> 24:27.446
Call Respiratory.
Have them set up a vent.

24:27.613 --> 24:31.367
- What's wrong with my Vincenzo?
- It's okay. Please stand back.

24:31.576 --> 24:35.123
He's a good man. We have six children,
11 grandchildren.

24:35.331 --> 24:37.792
Mrs. Scarletti,
you need to wait outside.

24:37.959 --> 24:40.087
- I need to what?
- Carol, can I get an assist?

24:40.254 --> 24:43.090
Mrs. Scarletti, come on.
Let's go wait in the hall.

24:45.843 --> 24:46.886
Carol.

24:47.095 --> 24:50.473
Come on. We need to let
the doctor do his job. Come on.

24:50.683 --> 24:52.184
Come with me.

24:53.895 --> 24:57.024
- Where's Anspaugh? He's late.
- He's doing a Triple-A.

24:57.232 --> 25:00.445
Those can slog on.
You got something juicy?

25:00.653 --> 25:01.821
Yeah. Hernia repair.

25:01.988 --> 25:04.993
Mine's a hot appendix.
They can't all be newsworthy, eh?

25:05.159 --> 25:08.956
Unlike your osteochondral allograft
this afternoon, huh?

25:09.165 --> 25:11.208
You intentionally sidelined me
for that.

25:11.375 --> 25:12.418
What?

25:12.626 --> 25:15.337
Handing me off to Anspaugh
so you could be with Romano.

25:15.504 --> 25:17.507
That's the silliest thing
I've ever heard.

25:17.716 --> 25:20.678
He called me in to consult.
Not the other way around.

25:22.973 --> 25:24.349
If you say so.

25:24.558 --> 25:27.729
No. It's not just what I say.
That's the way it was.

25:28.104 --> 25:30.064
When did Anspaugh start the Triple-A?

25:30.273 --> 25:31.524
An hour ago.

25:32.026 --> 25:35.154
My patient's prepped.
I hate to get backed up.

25:35.362 --> 25:37.240
Yeah. You are busy today.

25:37.824 --> 25:40.702
Anspaugh wouldn't mind if
I just started, would he?

25:40.910 --> 25:42.997
It's painting by numbers.

25:43.289 --> 25:45.374
I haven't seen him mind yet.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.799
So you're okay finding another ride?

25:52.759 --> 25:54.802
- I can still take you home.
- No problem.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.346
I just totally spaced it.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.559
I agreed to have dinner with
my grandmother tonight.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.269
So this is just an appetizer?

26:01.477 --> 26:04.815
- Well, her cooking's not exactly-
- Carter, Anna, over here!

26:06.901 --> 26:08.028
Help me.

26:08.528 --> 26:10.655
- I can't breathe.
- Just relax. Hang on.

26:10.864 --> 26:13.744
- I'm taking this off.
- No! It's for my allergies.

26:13.951 --> 26:16.455
- I told the other doctor!
- What other doctor?

26:16.621 --> 26:17.789
Let's get a gurney.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.833
- Is that Mr. Scarletti?
- Yup.

26:20.041 --> 26:22.378
- Advanced lung cancer.
- Did you pull his records?

26:22.588 --> 26:25.966
He was in two weeks ago.
They told him the cancer's inoperable.

26:26.508 --> 26:28.802
- He never told his wife.
- Apparently not.

26:28.969 --> 26:30.013
What's her name?

26:30.221 --> 26:32.933
Margaret Scarletti.
Do you want me to go talk to her?

26:33.100 --> 26:34.143
I'll do it.

26:34.351 --> 26:38.898
Mark, I apologize for being late.
I had lunch with a rep from Synergix.

26:39.107 --> 26:41.569
- He had interesting ideas.
- We're slammed here-

26:41.777 --> 26:43.946
- That crackhead in 3 is screaming-
- Wait.

26:44.155 --> 26:48.910
I'd like to discuss the staffing
situation since it affects us both.

26:49.119 --> 26:52.416
I don't know what you're talking about.
Write it down in a memo.

26:52.624 --> 26:55.127
This woman collapsed outside.
She said she saw you.

26:55.294 --> 26:57.464
Probably anaphylactic shock.
I'll be there.

26:57.630 --> 26:59.841
- I'll get it.
- The back pain wants more Demerol.

27:00.008 --> 27:02.469
- In a minute.
- Can you sign off on this for me?

27:02.678 --> 27:04.096
- No.
- We could use the beds.

27:04.305 --> 27:06.725
- What should I do about the back pain?
- Ask Doyle.

27:06.933 --> 27:10.771
- It's the hospital's insurance attorney.
- Take a message.

27:12.273 --> 27:16.903
- Mrs. Scarletti, could you come with me?
- My husband, will he be okay?

27:17.112 --> 27:18.447
Will he live? How is he?

27:18.655 --> 27:20.783
I don't think we should
discuss this here.

27:20.992 --> 27:25.205
- What did you say? Will he live?
- We need to find a place to talk.

27:25.414 --> 27:28.250
I'm worried about Vincenzo.
Please, can I go see him?

27:28.459 --> 27:30.336
No. No, no, no. Not now.

27:30.545 --> 27:32.505
- I just wanna see him.
- Mrs. Scarletti...

27:32.714 --> 27:35.509
...your husband has no chance
for a meaningful recovery.

27:35.676 --> 27:39.806
- He'll recover okay? Oh, thank you-
- No, no, no.

27:40.181 --> 27:43.519
I said, your husband has no chance
for a meaningful recovery.

27:44.228 --> 27:47.065
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

27:47.273 --> 27:50.820
I'm saying that your husband lied
to you about his condition!

27:51.029 --> 27:52.363
He's going to die!

27:59.706 --> 28:01.751
Jeanie, can you explain it to her?

28:01.958 --> 28:04.128
Mark, come on.
Let's talk for a second.

28:04.295 --> 28:05.546
Come here.

28:10.970 --> 28:13.139
Shouldn't somebody go after him?

28:22.233 --> 28:23.651
Dr. Corday.

28:24.193 --> 28:27.740
Heard you were elbow-deep
in a rather dicey Triple-A.

28:27.948 --> 28:30.160
I heard you were doing the appy.

28:30.368 --> 28:32.954
All finished. Twenty minutes and done.

28:34.290 --> 28:36.834
You operated without
an Attending present?

28:37.043 --> 28:39.713
Just an appendicectomy.
There weren't complications.

28:39.921 --> 28:43.509
The complication is that
you disregarded hospital policy.

28:43.718 --> 28:46.762
With something as basic as this,
I assumed there was leeway.

28:47.306 --> 28:48.891
You've been here several months.

28:49.099 --> 28:52.604
Have you seen any surgery
performed without an Attending?

28:53.479 --> 28:54.565
No.

28:55.608 --> 28:59.279
I apologize. In Britain we do minor
surgery without supervision.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.407
I was led to believe the same
standards applied here.

29:02.616 --> 29:03.784
By whom?

29:04.785 --> 29:06.829
I was mistaken. That's all.

29:07.288 --> 29:08.915
It won't happen again.

29:12.127 --> 29:15.132
- Is it true he just walked out?
- Cynthia hot on his heels.

29:15.299 --> 29:17.008
He seemed like such a sensitive guy.

29:17.176 --> 29:19.971
He is. Doesn't everybody
have some work to do?

29:20.180 --> 29:23.099
Can't do anything until
he does something for himself.

29:24.435 --> 29:26.729
I'm not gonna make it home
to change.

29:26.937 --> 29:28.063
Big plans?

29:28.272 --> 29:30.691
I'm asking this foundation
for a lot of money.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.530
- I don't have anything to wear.
- I have a jacket you can borrow.

29:34.739 --> 29:36.490
It's from Goodwill, but it's decent.

29:36.657 --> 29:38.493
- Thanks, that'd be great.
- Sure.

29:38.660 --> 29:41.288
From what Carter says,
his grandma's tough.

29:41.496 --> 29:43.499
- Carter, meaning John Carter?
- Yeah.

29:43.666 --> 29:46.002
It's called the Carter Family
Foundation...

29:46.169 --> 29:49.424
...but she holds the purse strings
with an iron claw.

29:49.632 --> 29:52.844
- The Carter Family Foundation?
- Yeah, they're loaded.

29:53.011 --> 29:56.557
Carter's real blue blood. It's this
whole Upstairs, Downstairs thing.

29:56.765 --> 30:01.229
It might help you to take a doctor
along with you to make your case.

30:01.438 --> 30:03.733
I wrote some Pedes clinic
grants at CHOP.

30:03.941 --> 30:06.068
- You sure?
- I'd love to come along.

30:06.277 --> 30:07.361
Okay.

30:07.612 --> 30:08.989
It's like I can't breathe.

30:09.197 --> 30:13.703
It's like something inside of my head
pushing, trying to get out. And I...

30:14.203 --> 30:18.208
Every time I think I have things
under control, it just goes south.

30:18.792 --> 30:21.378
- I'm babbling.
- If you don't wanna talk about it-

30:25.508 --> 30:28.889
A few months ago, I was attacked
in the men's room in the ER...

30:29.055 --> 30:33.853
...by this gangbanger who blames me for
his brother dying of a gunshot wound.

30:34.061 --> 30:36.397
Oh, my God!
That's the creep who's suing you?

30:36.564 --> 30:39.859
They settled the malpractice suit
for three million dollars.

30:40.068 --> 30:44.490
And now the bastard's suing me
for violating his brother's civil rights.

30:44.699 --> 30:46.576
I mean, figure that one out.

30:46.785 --> 30:48.120
I can't believe it.

30:49.246 --> 30:53.418
He attacked me from behind.
I tried to fight back, but I-

30:53.585 --> 30:56.589
He could've had a gun
or been on drugs or-

30:56.797 --> 31:01.261
I didn't even think about that.
My adrenaline was pumping so hard.

31:01.887 --> 31:03.847
You're right.
People on PCP, they...

31:04.639 --> 31:06.350
He could've killed you.

31:16.196 --> 31:17.323
Mark...

31:18.364 --> 31:22.078
...you're so used to handling
everyone else's problems that...

31:22.287 --> 31:24.456
...you're not used to
asking for help.

31:47.359 --> 31:48.903
- Jeanie.
- Hi.

31:49.111 --> 31:51.531
These horse pills are
the hardest to swallow.

31:51.740 --> 31:53.700
We should talk.

31:54.367 --> 31:56.537
I know, today's been insane.
Heard from Mark?

31:56.704 --> 31:59.290
I've talked to Dr. Anspaugh
about the ER budget.

31:59.457 --> 32:02.127
He's very concerned about our deficit.

32:02.336 --> 32:05.506
The overages can be contained
with structural changes...

32:05.673 --> 32:08.051
...if we pursue industrial contracts-

32:08.259 --> 32:10.179
Kerry, wait. What are you saying?

32:11.597 --> 32:15.185
I have to lay off some of the staff
including two PAs.

32:15.351 --> 32:19.607
The fairest way to do that is to give
preference to those with seniority.

32:21.735 --> 32:23.027
Are you firing me?

32:26.491 --> 32:29.118
Jeanie, I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

32:29.327 --> 32:31.288
You were the last one hired.

32:31.496 --> 32:35.376
You can work to the end of the month.
COBRA insurance will cover your meds.

32:35.585 --> 32:37.712
I've talked to Physical Therapy.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.424
They'll have an opening
in the next few months.

32:40.633 --> 32:43.093
Except it pays about
a third less than here.

32:43.302 --> 32:46.474
I want this to be short-term.
We're pursuing contracts.

32:46.682 --> 32:49.101
When the new system is up,
I want you back.

32:49.310 --> 32:51.396
So I'm supposed to wait
by the phone?

32:51.605 --> 32:56.235
Jeanie, you know I value you
professionally and as a friend.

32:56.402 --> 32:58.404
And I'm going to try to work this out.

32:58.571 --> 33:00.908
No, please don't go to
any more trouble.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.308
Do I look okay?

33:22.516 --> 33:23.643
You look great.

33:26.396 --> 33:27.857
Miss Hathaway and...?

33:28.066 --> 33:31.694
- Dr. Del Amico. Anna.
- Mrs. Carter will be a few moments.

33:31.903 --> 33:34.657
But she insists you have a cocktail.
What may I bring you?

33:36.408 --> 33:39.622
- Spring water would be fine.
- Yes. And you, ma'am?

33:39.830 --> 33:41.331
What kind of beer do you have?

33:41.498 --> 33:45.794
- Heineken, Grolsch, Amstel Light-
- Just make that another spring water.

33:46.003 --> 33:48.966
Certainly. Will you follow me
to the music room?

33:49.967 --> 33:51.010
Please.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.105
Oh, my God.

34:02.191 --> 34:04.026
That's Mr. Carter in 1985.

34:04.193 --> 34:07.822
He and Marigold took home blue ribbons
at Tempel Farms that year.

34:08.031 --> 34:09.658
Marigold?

34:10.159 --> 34:11.284
His thoroughbred.

34:11.659 --> 34:13.411
Please, make yourself comfortable.

34:19.670 --> 34:21.922
Hey, Carol.
Did you find the place okay?

34:22.214 --> 34:23.926
Hey, Carter.

34:24.176 --> 34:25.761
Nice place you have here.

34:28.056 --> 34:29.724
- ER.
- Any word from Mark?

34:29.931 --> 34:32.061
No, but everybody else keeps calling.

34:32.686 --> 34:34.228
- ER.
- Could you sign off on this?

34:34.438 --> 34:36.690
- Mark never got to it.
- Some day, huh?

34:36.858 --> 34:38.234
Yeah. Some day.

34:38.568 --> 34:41.572
This is a horrible job.
When is that temp clerk coming?

34:41.781 --> 34:44.367
- ER. What do you want?
- I am out of here.

34:44.576 --> 34:46.244
Oh, Doug. It's for you.

34:46.411 --> 34:49.539
- Tell them I already left.
- It's long-distance, collect.

34:53.837 --> 34:55.797
Hello. This is Doug Ross.

34:56.590 --> 34:58.092
Yeah. Okay.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.098
Yeah.

35:06.895 --> 35:08.021
When?

35:10.398 --> 35:13.277
Okay. Are you sure?
Is it-? Okay.

35:13.487 --> 35:15.529
Yeah. Hang on. Could you...?

35:24.540 --> 35:25.626
Okay.

35:27.545 --> 35:28.796
Thank you.

35:31.257 --> 35:33.885
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is fine.

35:42.563 --> 35:44.231
No. I mean, I've seen it.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.443
I've seen what she's talking about.

35:46.651 --> 35:49.738
An ER is about emergent cases.
It's about speed.

35:49.946 --> 35:53.160
Patients that need continuity
of care tend to...

35:53.868 --> 35:56.079
...fall through the cracks.
I had a diabetic-

35:56.288 --> 36:01.002
I'm sure your diabetic is fascinating.
But I'd like to speak to the lady.

36:01.211 --> 36:03.505
Sure, of course. I'm sorry.

36:04.340 --> 36:05.508
Alone.

36:07.135 --> 36:08.845
- Right.
- Me too?

36:09.304 --> 36:12.934
- Give her a tour of the grounds.
- Okay.

36:16.647 --> 36:17.774
Excuse me.

36:22.821 --> 36:24.865
Dr. Corday, I'm changing.

36:25.282 --> 36:28.827
- Shedding your skin, Dr. Snake?
- I beg your pardon.

36:29.036 --> 36:31.414
You knew I wasn't permitted
to perform that appy.

36:31.624 --> 36:34.335
But you let me walk
right in there anyway.

36:34.543 --> 36:38.047
Like you knew I should have been
notified this morning, right?

36:38.255 --> 36:41.469
You were home. Hicks wanted to go.
Somebody needed to step in.

36:41.636 --> 36:44.388
Like you needed someone to step into
the ischemic bowel...

36:44.555 --> 36:45.807
...so you'd be with Romano.

36:45.974 --> 36:48.393
How dare you accuse me
of manipulation!

36:48.560 --> 36:52.357
I deserve better than that!
Besides, if I had really wanted to...

36:52.565 --> 36:55.569
...you wouldn't even
have been aware of it.

37:00.492 --> 37:02.911
All right. I suppose
I could've called you.

37:03.119 --> 37:05.247
But with your being at home and my-

37:05.456 --> 37:08.418
You are not the only one
who likes to cut.

37:08.585 --> 37:12.172
But if I'm the only one here,
then I won't be ashamed of doing it.

37:12.380 --> 37:15.092
Then I'll make sure you're
not in that position again.

37:15.344 --> 37:16.762
Why, thank you, Dr. Benton.

37:16.969 --> 37:19.306
- Dr. Romano. Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

37:19.514 --> 37:20.600
Absolutely.

37:20.767 --> 37:24.688
I was wondering if you were
still looking for...

37:24.897 --> 37:26.689
...an extra set of hands.

37:27.232 --> 37:29.110
Would those be Benton hands?

37:29.903 --> 37:30.945
Yes.

37:31.821 --> 37:35.409
You're thinking you like the looks
of the 21 st century, is that it?

37:35.618 --> 37:40.290
He simply wants to keep an eye on me.
Don't you, Dr. Benton?

37:41.958 --> 37:43.211
Someone needs to.

37:43.419 --> 37:46.131
I'll give it some thought.
We'll talk more.

37:51.345 --> 37:53.097
You remember Weebles?

37:53.515 --> 37:55.726
Those little egg-looking things?

37:55.976 --> 37:57.978
"Weebles wobble,
but they don't fall down"?

37:59.648 --> 38:01.148
Gamma used to hate it.

38:01.316 --> 38:05.196
I'd take the Fabergé eggs, and I'd
put them with my Weeble family...

38:05.404 --> 38:06.489
...as pets.

38:10.243 --> 38:13.247
All right. I'm sorry.
I should've said something.

38:13.456 --> 38:16.292
But you were so anti-rich people.

38:16.501 --> 38:19.088
I'm even more anti-liars.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.303
I wanted you to get to know me first.

38:24.512 --> 38:28.390
Okay. And meanwhile, I take you
to my favorite thrift store...

38:28.599 --> 38:31.645
...give you a tour of
Roach Manor this morning...

38:31.853 --> 38:34.315
...and you must have been laughing
your head off.

38:35.149 --> 38:38.278
- Not at all. I love that stuff.
- A little slumming, is that it?

38:39.988 --> 38:43.868
Before you knew all this, you saw me
for what I am, a regular guy.

38:44.035 --> 38:46.162
"A regular guy" doesn't
patronize people.

38:46.371 --> 38:48.415
You made me look like an idiot.

38:50.459 --> 38:52.170
Anna, I'm sorry.

38:53.963 --> 38:55.049
Forget it, Carter.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.221
So that's it?

38:59.846 --> 39:02.224
My family has a few bucks
and everything changes?

39:02.390 --> 39:05.728
- A few bucks? That's what it is to you?
- It's a figure of speech.

39:08.482 --> 39:10.943
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

39:11.568 --> 39:14.072
To you, this is all a figure of speech.

39:14.405 --> 39:15.657
To me...

39:18.077 --> 39:20.579
I'm just gonna go wait outside
until Carol gets done.

39:30.926 --> 39:33.805
Mark? It's Doug.

39:36.933 --> 39:38.101
Hi.

39:39.602 --> 39:42.272
Cynthia, I'm looking for Mark.

39:42.482 --> 39:44.608
He might be asleep. But I'll check.

39:44.776 --> 39:47.071
- Who is it?
- Come on in.

39:47.279 --> 39:48.614
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:48.781 --> 39:49.823
What's going on?

39:53.620 --> 39:54.788
Might be a bad time.

39:55.538 --> 39:57.958
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

40:07.178 --> 40:08.805
- You okay?
- Yeah.

40:12.142 --> 40:14.687
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

40:15.855 --> 40:16.982
I'm fine.

40:17.149 --> 40:19.485
We're all a little worried about you.

40:19.652 --> 40:21.195
I'm okay.

40:23.281 --> 40:24.324
Okay.

40:25.158 --> 40:26.994
I'll be taking a few days off.

40:27.161 --> 40:30.331
I got a call from California.
My dad died.

40:30.624 --> 40:32.501
What? What happened?

40:32.709 --> 40:36.255
It was a car wreck or something.
They weren't clear on the details.

40:36.464 --> 40:40.219
But I gotta go claim the body...

40:40.427 --> 40:42.263
...and stuff like that. So...

40:42.472 --> 40:43.764
I'm sorry.

40:49.688 --> 40:51.775
- I'll talk to you later.
- No. Come on in.

40:51.942 --> 40:53.108
That's okay. No, no, no.

40:53.317 --> 40:56.197
Come on in. I'll make some coffee.
Come on.

40:56.697 --> 40:57.740
All right.

41:00.994 --> 41:03.413
I looked him dead in the eye,
and I said...

41:03.622 --> 41:07.378
..."That might fly with your Hollywood
chippies, Mr. President...

41:07.586 --> 41:09.087
...but I am a lady. "

41:09.295 --> 41:10.381
What did he do?

41:10.547 --> 41:13.050
He took his hand off my rear
and apologized.

41:13.258 --> 41:14.552
And that was it?

41:14.761 --> 41:16.429
Then I slept with him.

41:17.764 --> 41:19.642
May I freshen you up?

41:19.850 --> 41:22.978
- No, thank you. I have to drive.
- And it's getting late.

41:23.187 --> 41:25.273
Time for the fat lady to sing.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.068
I like you, Carol.

41:27.235 --> 41:28.778
You remind me of me.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.112
Thank you.

41:30.489 --> 41:33.992
I think you might just possess...

41:34.201 --> 41:37.747
...the extreme bullheaded
stubbornness...

41:38.706 --> 41:40.501
...to make this clinic thing work.

41:41.710 --> 41:44.839
How would you like some seed money
to start you off?

41:46.759 --> 41:51.306
$75,000?
You haven't even read my proposal.

41:53.265 --> 41:56.437
It's my foundation.
Just don't tell my grandson.

41:56.604 --> 41:59.607
I have a stern, unapproachable image
to keep up.

41:59.941 --> 42:02.778
Well, then, this meeting
was hell from beginning to end.

42:02.986 --> 42:06.157
- Exactly.
- Thank you so much.

42:25.556 --> 42:28.142
Good, good. You're not too late.

42:28.351 --> 42:30.479
I wanted to get
the celebration rolling.

42:30.687 --> 42:32.105
Celebration?

42:32.940 --> 42:35.610
I got a supersaver ticket to Atlanta.

42:35.819 --> 42:39.365
Tommy's introducing me to some people.
And his sister-in-law...

42:39.573 --> 42:40.783
...is a realtor.

42:40.991 --> 42:43.827
- So you had a good day.
- No. Not just me.

42:44.037 --> 42:47.499
Tommy knows some doctors
at the county hospital.

42:47.958 --> 42:49.335
Sounds too good to be true.

42:49.502 --> 42:52.338
We can make this happen.
We can make this work.

42:54.716 --> 42:55.759
Hey...

42:58.304 --> 42:59.514
...what's wrong?

43:04.186 --> 43:05.522
Hi, Kerry.

43:05.687 --> 43:06.814
Ellis.

43:08.358 --> 43:10.819
I know this is strange.
We just met...

43:11.027 --> 43:14.282
...and here I am calling you up
to come have a drink.

43:14.491 --> 43:16.868
- I hope you don't misunderstand.
- Oh, no.

43:17.035 --> 43:19.956
You saved me from having
to watch the local news.

43:20.206 --> 43:22.041
I don't usually do this kind of thing.

43:22.250 --> 43:24.503
Sure. That's what they all say.

43:27.674 --> 43:29.050
What's on your mind?

43:31.469 --> 43:35.265
I had to lay off a pretty close friend
this afternoon...

43:35.474 --> 43:39.397
...and she didn't appreciate my
suggestions for getting through this.

43:41.147 --> 43:43.150
She just felt fired.

43:43.359 --> 43:45.236
Which is exactly what she was.

43:45.403 --> 43:46.738
That's right.

43:47.405 --> 43:51.285
When you try to get her job back,
she won't appreciate that, either.

43:53.997 --> 43:56.458
Welcome to the wonderful world
of management.

44:00.505 --> 44:01.839
Get you another drink?

44:03.801 --> 44:05.761
That'd be great. Thanks.

44:11.101 --> 44:14.897
- I wish you'd wait and leave tomorrow.
- I just want to get on with it.

44:23.617 --> 44:27.162
- Let me take you to the airport.
- I'll just leave it in Parking.

44:27.372 --> 44:29.958
- Pick Mark up too.
- I'm glad he's going with you.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.879
It's a good idea for him
to get out of town for a while.

44:40.345 --> 44:41.472
I'm gonna miss you.

44:44.517 --> 44:45.643
I love you, Carol.

44:56.073 --> 44:57.492
I love you too.
