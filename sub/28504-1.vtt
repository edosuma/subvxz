01:43.674 --> 01:45.106
Hello, Sal.

01:45.108 --> 01:46.273
Stan, I'm
getting real tired of you

01:46.275 --> 01:48.410
dodging my phone calls.

01:48.412 --> 01:49.877
You know what today is?

01:49.879 --> 01:51.445
Today is the last day
of the second extension

01:51.447 --> 01:53.213
that I've given you.

01:53.215 --> 01:57.385
I wake up to no phone calls,
no emails, not even a text.

01:57.387 --> 01:59.853
Well now, look, Sal.

01:59.855 --> 02:02.189
I was just finishing
up, and I was gonna send

02:02.191 --> 02:03.792
that out tonight.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.060
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:05.062 --> 02:06.460
You're probably sitting
there in your housecoat,

02:06.462 --> 02:10.899
in your slippers, and that
busted ass old typewriter.

02:10.901 --> 02:12.233
If you had a laptop
like everyone else,

02:12.235 --> 02:13.868
you'd be done by now.

02:13.870 --> 02:15.269
Why the hell do
you insist on using

02:15.271 --> 02:18.773
that ancient piece
of shit anyways?

02:18.775 --> 02:22.010
It's, well, it's
where all my ideas come from.

02:22.012 --> 02:23.377
Listen, man, I'm
too busy for your bullshit.

02:23.379 --> 02:26.180
Tonight, that's the deadline.

02:32.188 --> 02:34.089
The issue
has gained new urgency

02:34.091 --> 02:37.726
in recent years because of
cases of police brutality.

02:37.728 --> 02:40.028
The current law also
doesn't make public

02:40.030 --> 02:42.297
the videos from body cameras.

02:42.299 --> 02:43.099
Police...

02:44.768 --> 02:47.768
Phil Douglas reporting
live for Channel 5 News here.

02:47.770 --> 02:49.269
Local residents were
awoken early this morning

02:49.271 --> 02:51.940
to gunshots coming
from what they believed

02:51.942 --> 02:53.475
to be a vacant home in the area.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.209
First responders
found soon after

02:55.211 --> 02:57.278
removing the bodies of
three unidentified victims.

04:03.346 --> 04:04.245
Medic 17, 19 David.

04:04.247 --> 04:06.447
Medic 17, 19 David.

04:06.449 --> 04:09.149
Unconscious, 184 Washington,
the police notified.

04:11.588 --> 04:14.325
Medic 19 unit 87

04:15.591 --> 04:18.493
20 yards onto River
Parkway, Lafayette Ave,

04:18.495 --> 04:19.863
Cardiac 20 on.

04:21.997 --> 04:24.399
Medic
15, and 15 Davis to hire.

04:24.401 --> 04:27.301
Medic 15, 15 Davis at hire.

04:27.303 --> 04:29.437
That's it, shut
her down, shut it down.

04:29.439 --> 04:31.438
One, two, three.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.406
Let's go.

04:49.526 --> 04:50.490
Checking the chest.

04:50.492 --> 04:52.159
We'll need to shock.

04:52.161 --> 04:52.996
Okay.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.365
Shit, she just coded.

04:58.367 --> 05:01.368
Nate, get us the hell
outta here right now.

05:01.370 --> 05:02.402
Take your time.

05:02.404 --> 05:03.437
Take your time.

05:04.274 --> 05:05.408
Get it on right.

05:07.343 --> 05:08.308
All right.

05:08.310 --> 05:09.344
Okay.

05:09.346 --> 05:10.581
Are we charged?

05:12.014 --> 05:12.913
All right, stand clear.

05:12.915 --> 05:13.548
It's charged.

05:13.550 --> 05:14.382
Go.

05:16.286 --> 05:17.120
Clear.

05:19.221 --> 05:20.056
Nothing.

05:22.425 --> 05:24.562
All right, reset and charge.

05:25.995 --> 05:27.161
Okay, charged.

05:27.163 --> 05:29.400
Nothing, start CPR.

05:38.608 --> 05:40.310
The final suction.

05:42.612 --> 05:44.077
She's gone.

05:44.079 --> 05:45.279
No, I can still keep going.

05:45.281 --> 05:46.214
No, she's gone.

05:46.216 --> 05:47.048
I can still keep...

05:47.050 --> 05:48.416
Stop, she's gone.

05:48.418 --> 05:50.254
She's gone, all right.

05:54.357 --> 05:56.457
You can't save everyone.

05:56.459 --> 05:57.494
You can't.

05:59.362 --> 06:00.995
Call it, Nate.

06:00.997 --> 06:01.932
She's gone.

06:03.033 --> 06:04.300
Fuck.

06:05.302 --> 06:06.237
4:52 p.m.

07:29.319 --> 07:32.185
What's going on with you, man?

07:32.187 --> 07:33.022
Nate!

07:34.223 --> 07:35.055
Nate!

07:35.057 --> 07:36.289
Yeah.

07:36.291 --> 07:36.757
You've been
distant all night.

07:36.759 --> 07:37.493
What's up?

07:43.500 --> 07:47.200
That girl from
earlier, the OD.

07:47.202 --> 07:48.271
Okay.

07:50.105 --> 07:51.175
I knew her.

07:54.144 --> 07:58.148
We, uh, we dated for a
few years back in college.

07:59.682 --> 08:02.386
And, uh, seeing her like that,

08:04.687 --> 08:06.486
it did something.

08:06.488 --> 08:09.490
It just brought back
so many memories.

08:09.492 --> 08:12.392
I feel like I should've
done more, man.

08:12.394 --> 08:14.230
I should've done more.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.468
Listen, man.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.304
She was dead when we got there.

08:22.305 --> 08:23.837
Don't beat yourself up.

08:23.839 --> 08:26.642
Only so much you can do, right?

08:32.649 --> 08:36.052
Anyways, how's your
first day on the job?

08:39.489 --> 08:42.390
Well, things
certainly happened

08:42.392 --> 08:44.658
a lot faster than I
thought they would.

08:44.660 --> 08:48.329
Yeah.

08:48.331 --> 08:50.531
You'll come to learn pretty
quickly that those few moments

08:50.533 --> 08:54.104
between life and death
are pretty precious.

08:56.806 --> 09:00.141
So what got you
into this then?

09:02.412 --> 09:05.482
I'm 68 Whiskey,
I'm a combat medic,

09:06.349 --> 09:08.419
two tours in Afghanistan.

09:09.652 --> 09:11.752
Yeah, it's pretty easy to
get into this back home

09:11.754 --> 09:15.625
when you're not getting
shot at every night.

09:19.328 --> 09:20.596
What about you?

09:26.201 --> 09:29.206
Well, my older
brother had autism,

09:30.807 --> 09:32.810
pretty severe, actually.

09:35.378 --> 09:37.911
My parents used to make
me stay home with him

09:37.913 --> 09:39.680
when they'd go out.

09:39.682 --> 09:43.553
And wasn't really a
good idea on their half.

09:47.256 --> 09:50.892
He um, he had a seizure
and died in front of me

09:50.894 --> 09:52.262
when I was 11.

09:56.798 --> 09:57.867
I just froze.

10:01.504 --> 10:06.239
I guess I kinda feel like
I owe it to the world

10:06.241 --> 10:07.877
to help those in need.

10:11.914 --> 10:13.683
This was his watch.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.719
The song would calm him down.

10:24.527 --> 10:25.859
Well, here's a chance
to save the world.

10:25.861 --> 10:27.597
Medic 13, responding.

10:29.599 --> 10:31.398
All right, guys, let's go.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.536
Newbie, you got the check.

10:39.576 --> 10:40.377
Nathan.

10:41.410 --> 10:42.410
Nate!

10:42.412 --> 10:44.214
Come on man, let's go.

11:05.335 --> 11:06.968
Hey.

11:06.970 --> 11:07.771
Hey.

11:12.808 --> 11:16.776
You have to learn how
to detach yourself

11:16.778 --> 11:19.780
for what you're going
to see on this job.

11:19.782 --> 11:21.618
It will eat you alive.

11:22.918 --> 11:24.384
You're going to see much worse.

11:24.386 --> 11:25.221
Trust me.

11:26.788 --> 11:28.689
How much worse?

11:28.691 --> 11:30.757
I once got a call to a house

11:30.759 --> 11:32.727
where a 13-year-old
girl's boyfriend

11:32.729 --> 11:35.329
tried to blow his brains out.

11:35.331 --> 11:37.801
He was still alive, but no face.

11:46.576 --> 11:49.709
Where the fuck is this
place, man?

11:49.711 --> 11:52.680
GPS says we arrived
five minutes ago.

11:52.682 --> 11:53.683
Wait.

11:54.783 --> 11:57.318
I see a house up there.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.754
That's a house?

11:59.721 --> 12:01.689
Does anybody live there?

12:01.691 --> 12:06.326
Fuck, okay, pull up to the front
side of the driveway there.

13:16.932 --> 13:18.866
Where are the cops?

13:18.868 --> 13:19.800
They should have
been here by now.

13:19.802 --> 13:21.502
They should've sent units.

13:21.504 --> 13:23.440
Yeah, they should've.

13:27.876 --> 13:29.443
All right.

13:29.445 --> 13:30.076
Well, let's check it out.

13:30.078 --> 13:30.913
Come on.

13:32.081 --> 13:32.912
What?

13:32.914 --> 13:34.748
Shouldn't we wait?

13:34.750 --> 13:35.849
They'll be here.

13:35.851 --> 13:38.618
Someone obviously called 911.

13:38.620 --> 13:39.456
Let's go.

13:42.591 --> 13:43.590
Wait, Lace.

13:43.592 --> 13:44.824
Hang back, stay on the radio.

13:44.826 --> 13:47.596
See if they got units en route.

13:52.601 --> 13:53.666
You know, she's
not gonna learn much

13:53.668 --> 13:54.904
in the carpool.

14:02.544 --> 14:05.445
Man, do you smell that?

14:07.750 --> 14:10.850
Even more reason
why we should not be here.

14:10.852 --> 14:13.421
Are you with me on this or...

14:13.423 --> 14:14.854
Do I have a choice?

14:14.856 --> 14:16.392
No, you don't.

14:17.058 --> 14:18.559
EMS!

14:18.561 --> 14:19.562
Anyone home?

14:21.663 --> 14:22.530
Hello, anyone here?

14:22.532 --> 14:23.367
EMS!

14:26.802 --> 14:29.002
Oh.

14:29.004 --> 14:30.537
Hello, anybody here?

14:30.539 --> 14:33.873
man.

14:33.875 --> 14:34.775
Hello, EMS!

14:34.777 --> 14:35.846
Is anyone home?

14:37.078 --> 14:40.881
This is like a.

14:40.883 --> 14:42.652
Clear here.

14:43.985 --> 14:46.021
I don't want you to...

14:53.129 --> 14:54.994
Great.

14:57.966 --> 14:58.898
Hello, EMS!

14:58.900 --> 14:59.935
Is anyone home?

15:01.003 --> 15:02.036
Anybody here?

15:02.038 --> 15:02.873
Hello?

15:04.105 --> 15:06.409
No one's inside.

15:09.010 --> 15:12.012
No one's
lived here for years.

15:12.014 --> 15:13.113
Hello, is anyone home?

15:13.115 --> 15:13.950
EMS!

15:14.884 --> 15:16.419
Watch your head.

15:17.119 --> 15:19.189
We're already in.

15:22.924 --> 15:23.991
Hello, is anyone home?

15:23.993 --> 15:24.828
EMS!

15:26.729 --> 15:27.998
Wes, I got one!

15:33.936 --> 15:36.070
Gunshot
wounds to the chest.

15:36.072 --> 15:37.938
You got a pulse?

15:37.940 --> 15:39.943
We got nothing.

15:41.143 --> 15:42.446
Yeah.

15:43.546 --> 15:44.911
Any?

15:44.913 --> 15:46.015
No.

15:50.653 --> 15:52.923
They got 'em dead.

15:54.590 --> 15:57.023
All right, let's
pack it in.

16:54.649 --> 16:56.052
She dies, you die.

17:00.088 --> 17:01.023
You got it?

17:04.992 --> 17:05.994
Well, go on!

17:08.195 --> 17:11.097
Look, look, man.

17:11.098 --> 17:16.036
Help me, fucker.

17:16.038 --> 17:17.837
See what we found outside.

17:25.012 --> 17:27.146
Go on, get out.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.315
In there.

17:30.251 --> 17:31.852
What do we do with this one?

17:31.854 --> 17:33.821
Just take her upstairs.

17:37.692 --> 17:39.093
Come on!

17:39.095 --> 17:40.893
Fail, you turn out
like your friend here.

17:48.269 --> 17:49.902
Yeah.

17:49.904 --> 17:51.740
As you ask, I'll be.

17:59.181 --> 18:00.016
Wow.

18:07.355 --> 18:09.422
Sir, this woman needs
to get to a hospital.

18:09.424 --> 18:12.061
She'll die if she stays here.

18:13.863 --> 18:14.698
Mary.

18:32.147 --> 18:36.382
Hey, hey, hey,
hey wake up.

18:36.384 --> 18:38.221
Come on, boy, wake up.

18:43.759 --> 18:47.096
Come on.

19:11.854 --> 19:12.756
Easy, easy.

19:13.756 --> 19:14.388
Listen to me.

19:19.228 --> 19:21.394
Wha, what happened?

19:21.396 --> 19:23.029
Where am I?

19:23.031 --> 19:26.165
Listen, we
gotta find a way outta here.

19:26.167 --> 19:28.267
The girl, there
was a girl with me.

19:28.269 --> 19:29.436
Have you seen her?

19:29.438 --> 19:31.238
I've heard screams

19:31.240 --> 19:33.806
but it's been quiet for awhile.

19:33.808 --> 19:36.278
They took my partner downstairs.

19:40.982 --> 19:42.149
Listen, is there anything
around here we can use

19:42.151 --> 19:44.187
to cut through these ropes?

19:46.387 --> 19:50.259
I had, I had a knife
in my pocket earlier.

19:56.030 --> 19:58.167
I'll see if I can get to it.

20:00.301 --> 20:03.972
These ropes tight.

20:08.109 --> 20:08.944
Got it.

20:14.784 --> 20:16.315
Come on, cut faster.

20:46.315 --> 20:48.114
Howdy boys.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.217
Oh look at these two assholes.

20:50.219 --> 20:52.788
Where's my partner?

20:55.057 --> 20:57.857
You know, I wanted
to be a cop once.

20:57.859 --> 21:00.259
They said I couldn't
because my hearing.

21:00.261 --> 21:01.527
Where
the fuck is he?

21:01.529 --> 21:06.536
Oh, I certainly
heard that.

21:07.936 --> 21:08.401
What the
fuck are you doing?

21:09.404 --> 21:11.371
You gotta be quiet.

21:22.250 --> 21:26.319
Yeah, scream and beg it,
scream and beg it will you?

21:30.593 --> 21:33.429
Can you believe
that, bad hearing?

21:34.930 --> 21:37.631
Hey, Billy, get your
mute ass in here.

21:42.304 --> 21:46.440
You know Billy, what we got
here, we got here is a pig.

21:46.442 --> 21:48.574
What do we do with pigs?

21:48.576 --> 21:50.110
We butcher them.

21:51.380 --> 21:54.484
Looks like the time's
up, piggly wiggly.

22:00.288 --> 22:02.826
Billy, put some gas in that.

22:05.461 --> 22:07.529
I'll see you dinner time.

22:26.515 --> 22:27.951
I'm hurrying.

22:29.417 --> 22:31.486
Cutting as fast as I can.

22:37.526 --> 22:38.926
Almost got it, almost got it.

24:06.414 --> 24:09.115
Oh please cut it out.

33:09.590 --> 33:10.758
Mommy.

37:59.347 --> 38:01.347
Lace, Lace,
Lacey, Lacey, Lacey!

38:01.349 --> 38:03.583
Calm down, calm
down, it's all right.

38:03.585 --> 38:05.150
Come on, get up, get
up, I know a way out.

38:05.152 --> 38:06.821
Get up, we gotta go.

38:09.224 --> 38:10.159
Right here.

38:18.867 --> 38:23.168
All right, all right, Lacey,
Lacey, Lacey, you okay?

38:23.170 --> 38:25.170
Are you okay, are
you hurt, Lacey?

38:25.172 --> 38:26.171
You killed him.

38:26.173 --> 38:27.005
Lacey!

38:27.007 --> 38:28.039
Keep your voice down.

38:28.041 --> 38:28.974
You saw what happened in there.

38:28.976 --> 38:30.342
I had no choice.

38:30.344 --> 38:32.912
There's another one
downstairs and there are more.

38:32.914 --> 38:34.981
We have got to get
out of here, Lacey.

38:34.983 --> 38:36.151
We have to go!

38:37.885 --> 38:39.150
Follow me.

38:50.297 --> 38:51.496
Lacey!

38:51.498 --> 38:53.465
We have to go!

38:53.467 --> 38:54.302
Come on.

39:39.579 --> 39:40.414
Listen!

39:48.322 --> 39:49.156
Thank God.

39:50.090 --> 39:53.327
Cops are here.

40:26.193 --> 40:28.362
Lacey, what are you doing?

40:35.603 --> 40:37.639
Listen, listen, this one.

40:40.108 --> 40:41.740
Done good, doll.

40:41.742 --> 40:43.478
You done real good.

40:47.114 --> 40:48.581
He made them.

40:48.583 --> 40:52.253
Wanna know what I
learned on my first day?

40:56.224 --> 40:59.161
You can't just
can't save everyone.

41:03.164 --> 41:06.264
Looks like we
got some company.

41:06.266 --> 41:07.432
I'll take care of it.

41:07.434 --> 41:08.469
Okay.

41:29.757 --> 41:31.624
Something's not right here.

41:31.626 --> 41:33.458
Why do you say that?

41:33.460 --> 41:34.526
There's no ambulance around

41:34.528 --> 41:37.595
and the responding
units aren't here.

41:43.070 --> 41:43.739
Let's go.

41:47.608 --> 41:50.775
Help, help me,
help me, please.

41:50.777 --> 41:51.610
Can you help me?

41:51.612 --> 41:52.644
Show me your hands.

41:52.646 --> 41:53.612
Show us your hands!

41:53.614 --> 41:55.380
Ma'am, are you alone?

41:55.382 --> 41:56.115
I am.

41:56.117 --> 41:57.316
I'm a paramedic.

41:57.318 --> 41:58.349
- Just calm down.
- I'm an EMT.

41:58.351 --> 41:59.651
Ma'am, are you alone.

41:59.653 --> 42:01.519
I'm a, I'm a paramedic.

42:01.521 --> 42:03.121
- I need help, please.
- Calm down now.

42:03.123 --> 42:04.590
Ma'am are you alone?

42:04.592 --> 42:08.159
Was there
someone else in the house?

42:11.132 --> 42:13.235
Who else is in the house?

42:18.271 --> 42:19.440
Just family.

42:37.592 --> 42:39.624
Show 55,

42:39.626 --> 42:40.825
go for the large.

42:40.827 --> 42:42.894
Divers should be all set.

42:42.896 --> 42:45.463
Carsells
and Dunright, 10-4.

44:46.586 --> 44:48.854
And did you see
anything last night?

44:48.856 --> 44:51.560
No, um, it's not what I see.

44:52.626 --> 44:53.958
I hear things.

44:53.960 --> 44:55.728
There was a loud
knock at the door

44:55.730 --> 44:58.796
and a voice just
yells threatening.

44:58.798 --> 45:00.666
It just gets louder and louder.

45:00.668 --> 45:03.369
It becomes deafening.

45:03.371 --> 45:05.539
I'm completely motionless.

45:06.407 --> 45:09.307
Just laying there helpless.

45:09.309 --> 45:13.815
I try to scream to wake up
but that hardly ever works.

45:15.016 --> 45:17.950
I'm gonna prescribe
for you an antidepressant

45:17.952 --> 45:20.286
and I want you to come
back in about two weeks.

48:51.931 --> 48:53.965
Yeah, these pills you gave me,

48:53.967 --> 48:55.566
I don't think they're working.

48:55.568 --> 48:58.503
In fact, I think
everything's getting worse.

48:58.505 --> 49:01.005
Listen Jacob, these pills,
they take a couple days

49:01.007 --> 49:02.476
to take effect.

49:04.210 --> 49:07.679
Give it another night
and then gimme a call.

49:07.681 --> 49:12.052
If this keeps going on like
this, I fear for my life.

49:13.621 --> 49:14.987
Remember, Jacob, they're
just hallucinations.

49:14.989 --> 49:16.554
They're not real.

49:16.556 --> 49:17.188
We'll talk to you soon.

49:17.190 --> 49:19.557
Remember to call me.

49:19.559 --> 49:20.691
All right.

49:20.693 --> 49:22.561
Goodbye, Doctor.

51:07.101 --> 51:09.034
Hello, Dr. Frank here.

51:09.036 --> 51:12.170
Hey, Doc, these
pills still aren't working.

51:12.172 --> 51:14.139
All right, we're gonna
need you to come in.

51:14.141 --> 51:16.273
We're gonna give you a
different prescription.

51:16.275 --> 51:18.175
Yeah, I think
that would be best.

51:18.177 --> 51:19.211
I'll see you soon.

51:19.213 --> 51:20.746
All right, goodbye, Jacob.

53:40.487 --> 53:42.019
Where'd that come from?

53:42.021 --> 53:43.287
Dad told me I
can carve a pumpkin

53:43.289 --> 53:46.958
when he gets home
from work tonight.

53:46.960 --> 53:47.795
Okay.

53:49.096 --> 53:51.295
Let's just set it down

53:51.297 --> 53:54.234
and go get washed
up for dinner, okay?

54:05.813 --> 54:09.313
Hey, don't go making
promises you can't keep

54:09.315 --> 54:14.119
'cause I'm the one that
has to keep lying to him.

54:14.121 --> 54:16.124
Don't screw this one up.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.260
Are you
finished, Michael.

54:31.204 --> 54:35.974
And, I talked to Daddy and
he has to work late tonight.

54:35.976 --> 54:38.376
He wanted me to let you know
that he loves you very much

54:38.378 --> 54:43.180
and he's gonna carve the
pumpkins with you tomorrow, okay?

55:55.255 --> 55:57.054
Janet, Janet, no!

55:57.056 --> 55:58.356
No, come one, dear God, no!

55:58.358 --> 56:02.394
Janet, Janet, Jack,
Jack, where are you?

56:02.396 --> 56:07.034
Janet, no, come on,
Janet.

56:14.340 --> 56:19.209
And that is why, as legend
says, he carves their likeness

56:19.211 --> 56:22.983
into a pumpkin and leaves
it on the doorstep.

56:30.356 --> 56:32.525
That'll be 6.50, please.

56:39.365 --> 56:41.432
There you
go, keep the change.

57:11.465 --> 57:12.764
Peter.

57:12.766 --> 57:13.601
Peter.

57:14.434 --> 57:15.469
Dumbass.

57:16.436 --> 57:17.534
Hey fuck up.

57:17.536 --> 57:18.570
Get in?

57:18.572 --> 57:19.470
Yeah, I just got here.

57:19.472 --> 57:20.371
Burt wants us out front.

57:20.373 --> 57:23.508
We gotta do a pumpkin
display, all right?

57:51.204 --> 57:52.503
Oh my God.

57:52.505 --> 57:56.042
Carly, Carly, how I
wanna sit on your face.

57:57.376 --> 57:58.309
What the hell?

57:58.311 --> 58:00.381
I mean, I mean, I wanna,

58:02.516 --> 58:03.449
I want her to sit on my,

58:03.451 --> 58:05.682
you know what, actually,
either way it works.

58:05.684 --> 58:06.617
Fuck it.

58:06.619 --> 58:09.387
Yeah.

58:09.389 --> 58:11.488
Should probably go
big to small, right?

58:11.490 --> 58:12.523
No problem.

58:12.525 --> 58:16.496
So guess we'll start
with the larger ones first.

58:19.298 --> 58:20.432
Hey, Mikey.

58:20.434 --> 58:21.266
Crystal.

58:21.268 --> 58:22.099
Hi, Pete.

58:22.101 --> 58:22.733
Hey, Crystal.

58:22.735 --> 58:24.501
I like your glasses.

58:24.503 --> 58:25.570
Really?

58:25.572 --> 58:27.704
I feel like a dork.

58:27.706 --> 58:29.673
Are you guys working
prep shift tonight?

58:29.675 --> 58:30.508
Oh, yeah.

58:30.510 --> 58:32.209
We'll be here.

58:32.211 --> 58:33.411
Nice, I think Carly is too.

58:33.413 --> 58:35.579
It should be fun.

58:35.581 --> 58:37.615
All right, I'm
gonna get to work.

58:37.617 --> 58:38.749
I'll see you guys later.

58:38.751 --> 58:39.684
Bye, Crystal.

58:39.686 --> 58:40.521
See ya.

58:42.088 --> 58:44.789
Well, looks like
we're working all night.

58:54.367 --> 58:55.200
Now's the perfect time, man.

58:55.202 --> 58:56.404
Go talk to her.

58:58.237 --> 58:59.170
Here.

58:59.172 --> 59:01.673
Gotta stop talking.

59:01.675 --> 59:02.510
Right?

59:09.483 --> 59:11.648
Tell you that, that
looks nice by the way.

59:11.650 --> 59:12.717
Thanks.

59:24.297 --> 59:26.697
So
Crystal, how's school going?

59:26.699 --> 59:28.266
It's going good.

59:28.268 --> 59:29.633
It's really stressful.

59:29.635 --> 59:30.802
It's a lot of work.

59:30.804 --> 59:33.507
Plus working here, it's a lot.

59:34.673 --> 59:35.606
I really thought
I'd be able to get

59:35.608 --> 59:38.342
some studying in today but...

59:38.344 --> 59:39.776
You should, I
wouldn't tell anyone.

59:39.778 --> 59:40.614
Promise?

59:41.614 --> 59:42.780
You have my word, darlin'.

59:52.626 --> 59:53.590
Piss off, Mikey, would ya?

59:54.793 --> 59:56.394
Come on, how'd
you know it was me?

59:56.396 --> 59:58.695
I don't know, maybe
because of your breath.

59:58.697 --> 01:00:01.298
Right.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:01.932
What are you doing?

01:00:01.934 --> 01:00:03.333
You painting?

01:00:03.335 --> 01:00:04.601
Did you know that
Hitler was a painter.

01:00:06.672 --> 01:00:09.840
Yeah and he was also an
asshole so get outta here!

01:00:14.514 --> 01:00:15.579
Fuck.

01:00:17.617 --> 01:00:19.217
Well, go get it dick head.

01:00:19.219 --> 01:00:22.753
Jesus, all right.

01:01:05.831 --> 01:01:07.268
What?

01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:09.833
Guys, come look at this.

01:01:09.835 --> 01:01:10.670
Hey!

01:01:12.338 --> 01:01:14.639
Guys, come look at this.

01:01:14.641 --> 01:01:16.409
Seriously, come on.

01:01:30.356 --> 01:01:34.659
Are you serious, that,
that looks just like us.

01:01:34.661 --> 01:01:36.327
Is that supposed to
be a joke or something?

01:01:36.329 --> 01:01:37.929
That's fucking creepy.

01:01:37.931 --> 01:01:40.932
I mean, whoever
did this is weird,

01:01:40.934 --> 01:01:42.333
but it's pretty good actually.

01:01:44.336 --> 01:01:45.836
- Oh!
- Mikey!

01:01:51.978 --> 01:01:53.880
Fucking, fucking guy.

01:01:55.715 --> 01:01:58.849
He made the, he
made the pumpkin.

01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:03.820
What the fuck was that?

01:02:03.822 --> 01:02:05.925
He, he just killed him!

01:02:07.994 --> 01:02:09.559
- What is going on?
- Where's Carly?

01:02:09.561 --> 01:02:11.699
Where is she, where's Carly?

01:02:12.965 --> 01:02:14.898
I don't know.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.467
Carly!

01:02:16.469 --> 01:02:17.901
Carly!

01:02:17.903 --> 01:02:18.739
Fuck.

01:02:20.673 --> 01:02:21.507
Carly!

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.545
Hello?

01:02:29.849 --> 01:02:31.682
Is anyone there?

01:02:31.684 --> 01:02:32.950
Help!

01:02:32.952 --> 01:02:33.787
Help!

01:02:39.693 --> 01:02:40.527
Help!

01:03:01.648 --> 01:03:04.952
Oh, shit!

01:03:32.878 --> 01:03:34.479
Oh.

01:03:34.481 --> 01:03:35.749
Anyone, please.

01:03:36.882 --> 01:03:37.717
Help!

01:04:15.989 --> 01:04:17.988
Is this
here it's right now?

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.956
What the fuck just happened?

01:04:18.958 --> 01:04:20.858
I don't know.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.526
Where's Carly?

01:04:22.528 --> 01:04:24.095
We don't even know where Carly
is and we have to get out.

01:04:24.097 --> 01:04:25.563
Where's your phone?

01:04:25.565 --> 01:04:26.197
It's behind the
counter I think.

01:04:26.199 --> 01:04:27.130
Where's your phone?

01:04:27.132 --> 01:04:28.032
It's behind the counter.

01:04:28.034 --> 01:04:30.601
Fuck, so is mine.

01:04:30.603 --> 01:04:31.836
We should just stay here.

01:04:31.838 --> 01:04:32.704
He won't find us.

01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:33.905
No, no, let's get
the fuck up and go.

01:04:33.907 --> 01:04:35.106
Why'd he?

01:04:36.074 --> 01:04:37.074
What are we supposed to do?

01:04:37.076 --> 01:04:38.642
He's in here.

01:04:38.644 --> 01:04:39.577
- We're in here.
- Come on, let's go.

01:04:39.579 --> 01:04:40.912
Snap out of it, we gotta go.

01:04:40.914 --> 01:04:41.746
Come on.

01:04:43.916 --> 01:04:45.115
Okay.

01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:49.653
Where's the phones?

01:04:49.655 --> 01:04:50.588
I don't know.

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:52.523
Oh my God!

01:04:52.525 --> 01:04:54.157
Carly.

01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:56.961
Get a phone, get a phone!

01:04:56.963 --> 01:04:58.695
Uh, just the phone.

01:04:58.697 --> 01:05:00.764
The phones, the...

01:05:00.766 --> 01:05:02.900
We gotta go, we gotta go!

01:05:18.083 --> 01:05:19.983
Pete, Pete hold it.

01:05:19.985 --> 01:05:21.052
Where are we going,
where are we going?

01:05:21.054 --> 01:05:22.052
There's a house
on the other end.

01:05:22.054 --> 01:05:22.889
Let's go!

01:05:52.985 --> 01:05:54.020
Pete.

01:05:56.054 --> 01:05:57.220
Oh God.

01:05:57.222 --> 01:05:58.057
Pete!

01:06:02.094 --> 01:06:02.927
Pete!

01:06:11.637 --> 01:06:12.472
Oh Pete.

01:06:16.108 --> 01:06:17.110
No, Pete no.

01:06:25.117 --> 01:06:25.952
Pete.

01:06:28.855 --> 01:06:30.186
Pete!

01:09:54.091 --> 01:09:55.925
Well, the story goes
that the Midnight Man

01:09:55.927 --> 01:09:58.129
was a pagan warlock.

01:09:58.131 --> 01:09:59.330
They burned him to
death from midnight

01:09:59.332 --> 01:10:01.365
till three in the morning.

01:10:01.367 --> 01:10:02.767
But they say you
can bring him back

01:10:02.769 --> 01:10:04.871
with a ritual and a poem.

01:10:06.037 --> 01:10:07.937
Now I have to hear
the rest of this.

01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:10.374
From midnight till
three he comes for thee.

01:10:10.376 --> 01:10:14.077
If you can live until three
your soul may go free.

01:10:14.079 --> 01:10:15.211
And you believe this?

01:10:15.213 --> 01:10:17.180
It's not that I believe it,

01:10:17.182 --> 01:10:19.183
it's just, you know, a story
our parents would tell us

01:10:19.185 --> 01:10:23.053
when we were kids, kinda
like the devil for Catholics.

01:10:23.055 --> 01:10:26.190
We need something to
give us structure.

01:10:26.192 --> 01:10:27.525
I get what you're saying.

01:10:27.527 --> 01:10:29.259
It's weird, you know.

01:10:29.261 --> 01:10:32.796
Maybe to you, but there's
a lot of Wiccans out there,

01:10:32.798 --> 01:10:35.232
it's just most of us
choose not to tell anyone.

01:10:35.234 --> 01:10:38.138
Wiccan?

01:10:39.805 --> 01:10:41.273
So you're a witch?

01:10:42.307 --> 01:10:45.375
Oh, that's so cute,
where's your broom?

01:10:45.377 --> 01:10:50.116
Maybe up your ass with the
rest of the football team.

01:10:52.251 --> 01:10:55.119
Listen you gross little cunt.

01:10:55.121 --> 01:10:56.553
No one even invited you here

01:10:56.555 --> 01:11:00.156
so why don't you make like
a tree and get the fuck out.

01:11:09.268 --> 01:11:11.268
Listen, just get
the fuck outta here.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:13.206
Fuck you, Tom.

01:11:16.408 --> 01:11:18.474
You know what, Nikki,
you're an asshole.

01:11:18.476 --> 01:11:23.112
Stop playing
in the trash, Tommy.

01:11:23.114 --> 01:11:24.315
I hope
nothing really weird goes.

01:11:25.251 --> 01:11:27.287
Come on, man.

01:11:33.559 --> 01:11:35.025
Tonight
was fun, right?

01:11:35.027 --> 01:11:36.293
Hell yeah.

01:11:36.295 --> 01:11:37.861
We'll be feeling it
in the morning, mmm?

01:11:37.863 --> 01:11:38.595
Oh yeah.

01:11:38.597 --> 01:11:40.263
Yeah she will.

01:11:40.265 --> 01:11:43.202
Yeah.

01:11:44.203 --> 01:11:45.268
Phil.

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:47.271
Eric, you gonna
drive home, man?

01:11:47.273 --> 01:11:49.440
Come on, man, what
the fuck do you think?

01:11:49.442 --> 01:11:52.108
Me and Nikki are
off to go upstairs.

01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:53.313
You think so?

01:11:54.313 --> 01:11:59.118
Yeah, I do.

01:11:59.518 --> 01:12:00.884
Thanks.

01:12:00.886 --> 01:12:02.052
Best party ever, right?

01:12:03.555 --> 01:12:04.521
I don't know.

01:12:04.523 --> 01:12:06.956
Pretty close to it.

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:47.097
From midnight till
three he comes for thee.

01:12:47.099 --> 01:12:51.337
If you can live until three,
your soul may go free.

01:13:32.345 --> 01:13:34.477
Babe, what's wrong?

01:13:34.479 --> 01:13:36.679
Is something burning?

01:13:36.681 --> 01:13:39.482
Where is all this
smoke coming from?

01:13:39.484 --> 01:13:41.117
I don't care.

01:13:41.119 --> 01:13:43.187
No, seriously.

01:13:45.024 --> 01:13:47.057
Okay, there, there is
somebody out there.

01:13:48.327 --> 01:13:49.460
It's just people
leaving the party.

01:13:49.462 --> 01:13:50.593
They don't care that we're here.

01:13:50.595 --> 01:13:52.028
Come on.

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:55.531
Knock it off and go
check outside, bozo.

01:14:12.283 --> 01:14:13.118
Chad?

01:14:47.586 --> 01:14:50.289
Party's over, dude, go home.

01:14:52.524 --> 01:14:53.559
I said go home.

01:15:05.837 --> 01:15:06.669
Tom.

01:15:06.671 --> 01:15:07.673
Tom, get up.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.476
Someone's at the door.

01:15:13.712 --> 01:15:15.478
Tom.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:16.515
Go home, man.

01:15:17.783 --> 01:15:18.618
Shit.

01:15:30.762 --> 01:15:31.597
Hello.

01:15:32.765 --> 01:15:33.597
Hey.

01:15:33.599 --> 01:15:34.531
Hello.

01:15:34.533 --> 01:15:36.333
Why is it so foggy out here.

01:15:36.335 --> 01:15:37.166
I don't know.

01:15:37.168 --> 01:15:38.535
Maybe it rained.

01:15:38.537 --> 01:15:40.673
But there's nobody out here.

01:15:43.676 --> 01:15:47.113
Since when does
rain smell like fire?

01:16:10.903 --> 01:16:12.739
Oh, yeah, that's it.

01:16:16.242 --> 01:16:17.243
That's nice.

01:16:27.586 --> 01:16:28.421
Oh yeah.

01:16:32.925 --> 01:16:34.223
Oh yeah.

01:16:34.225 --> 01:16:35.394
You like that?

01:16:36.828 --> 01:16:38.562
Yeah.

01:16:47.338 --> 01:16:49.341
What, what's the matter?

01:16:50.376 --> 01:16:51.775
What's wrong?

01:16:51.777 --> 01:16:54.178
That's not your finger, right?

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.478
What?

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.713
You know,

01:16:56.715 --> 01:16:58.251
- back there.
- No!

01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:01.518
- In...
- What the fuck?

01:17:02.421 --> 01:17:03.187
What is it?

01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:04.257
What's wrong?

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.334
Eric's the man.

01:17:27.645 --> 01:17:29.213
I think I better
go check on 'em.

01:17:29.215 --> 01:17:30.981
No, no, they're fine.

01:17:30.983 --> 01:17:31.915
Just leave 'em alone.

01:17:31.917 --> 01:17:34.354
They're having a good time.

01:17:36.689 --> 01:17:38.487
I'm just gonna
check real quick.

01:17:38.489 --> 01:17:39.755
- Renee, come on.
- Be right back.

01:17:39.757 --> 01:17:43.462
You're being a huge
cockblock right now.

01:17:50.402 --> 01:17:51.738
You suck, Renee.

01:17:55.807 --> 01:17:59.811
Eric, I let you down.

01:18:15.493 --> 01:18:17.329
Guys, I'm coming in.

01:18:21.266 --> 01:18:23.333
What is he doing?

01:18:23.335 --> 01:18:23.970
Hey!

01:18:25.871 --> 01:18:27.306
Guys, you okay?

01:18:28.707 --> 01:18:29.873
Come on.

01:18:34.813 --> 01:18:36.349
Tom, help, help!

01:18:37.882 --> 01:18:38.717
Tom, no.

01:18:41.487 --> 01:18:42.322
Tom?

01:18:45.356 --> 01:18:45.992
Tom?

01:18:47.059 --> 01:18:51.061
What's happening?

01:18:51.063 --> 01:18:52.295
Tom.

01:18:53.599 --> 01:18:54.500
No, no Tom!

01:19:01.407 --> 01:19:02.242
No.

01:19:02.975 --> 01:19:03.810
No.

01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:07.247
I don't know, I don't know.

01:19:08.314 --> 01:19:09.780
No.

01:19:09.782 --> 01:19:10.613
No.

01:19:27.765 --> 01:19:29.098
Emma!

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.733
What are you doing down here?

01:19:30.735 --> 01:19:32.736
There's somebody in the
house and we have to get out.

01:19:32.738 --> 01:19:35.738
There is no way
out, not for you.

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:36.775
What?

01:19:37.777 --> 01:19:41.611
This misfortune you find
is by own manufacture.

01:19:41.613 --> 01:19:42.812
Don't you know
everything you do in life

01:19:42.814 --> 01:19:44.781
it has a consequence.

01:19:44.783 --> 01:19:46.750
What did you do?

01:19:46.752 --> 01:19:48.785
What did you do?

01:19:48.787 --> 01:19:51.053
People are dying, Emma.

01:19:51.055 --> 01:19:52.656
Tom is dead.

01:19:52.658 --> 01:19:55.392
All I ever wanted
was to be your friend.

01:19:55.394 --> 01:19:57.928
But you bullied me,
you ridiculed me,

01:19:57.930 --> 01:19:59.862
and you treated me
like I was nothing.

01:19:59.864 --> 01:20:00.897
No.

01:20:00.899 --> 01:20:03.903
Please, please make
it stop, please.

01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:07.003
I can't stop it.

01:20:07.005 --> 01:20:11.810
But if you can live until
three, your soul may go free.

01:20:12.778 --> 01:20:13.809
2:50.

01:20:13.811 --> 01:20:14.678
No.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.045
10 minutes to go.

01:20:16.047 --> 01:20:16.882
Please.

01:20:18.817 --> 01:20:19.652
No.

01:20:45.676 --> 01:20:47.477
Grace the circle's bound.

01:20:47.479 --> 01:20:49.044
Evil sink into the ground.

01:20:49.046 --> 01:20:50.679
Grace the circle's bound.

01:20:50.681 --> 01:20:52.148
Evil sink into the ground.

01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:53.950
Grace the circle's bound.

01:20:53.952 --> 01:20:55.684
Evil sink into the ground.

01:20:55.686 --> 01:20:57.153
Grace the circle's bound.

01:20:57.155 --> 01:20:59.054
Evil sink into the ground.

01:20:59.056 --> 01:21:00.924
Grace the circle's bound.

01:21:00.926 --> 01:21:02.858
Evil sink into the ground.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.634
3:00.

01:21:48.907 --> 01:21:49.708
Shit.

01:21:51.076 --> 01:21:51.877
Matches.

01:24:17.655 --> 01:24:20.089
Local book publisher Salvatore
Polizzi has passed away

01:24:20.091 --> 01:24:21.391
in a car crash on the corner

01:24:21.393 --> 01:24:23.759
of Coldwater and
Chronicle Drive.

01:24:23.761 --> 01:24:25.661
Polizzi's body was
ejected from his vehicle

01:24:25.663 --> 01:24:27.062
after striking a tree.

01:24:27.064 --> 01:24:31.835
Police are still investigating
the cause of the crash.

01:24:43.148 --> 01:24:44.182
Stan.

01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:49.119
Stan, the deadline is up.
