WEBVTT

00:02.499 --> 00:04.368
All right, not only am I
the world's greatest roommate

00:04.368 --> 00:06.103
I'm also the world's
greatest travel agent.

00:06.103 --> 00:07.971
Our spring break
problems are over.

00:07.971 --> 00:09.940
Sabrina, I know how badly
you want to go to Florida

00:09.940 --> 00:12.075
but I am not sleeping
in somebody's car.

00:12.075 --> 00:14.344
You don't have to. We're staying
at the Surfside Motel

00:14.344 --> 00:15.445
in Pelican Cove, Florida.

00:15.445 --> 00:16.713
It's the hottest place
for spring break

00:16.713 --> 00:18.348
this year-- a 24-hour party.

00:18.348 --> 00:19.883
Spellman, how did you
pull this off?

00:19.883 --> 00:21.919
Ah, while you were
all whiny about
not having plans

00:21.919 --> 00:23.887
I was surfing the net
for a place to surf.

00:23.887 --> 00:25.923
I also got some Jeb Bush
flippers on e-bay.

00:25.923 --> 00:28.492
I take back what I said
about you this morning.

00:28.492 --> 00:29.560
You rock.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.395
Girls, man your bikinis

00:31.395 --> 00:33.764
because we are heading
south for spring break!

00:33.764 --> 00:35.299
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:38.168 --> 00:44.775
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

00:44.775 --> 00:51.315
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

00:51.315 --> 00:54.484
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

00:54.484 --> 01:00.724
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:00.724 --> 01:03.594
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:03.594 --> 01:10.100
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:15.535 --> 01:16.903
I'm guessing you're
not jumping around

01:16.903 --> 01:18.571
because of the
new hand dryer
in the restroom.

01:18.571 --> 01:21.474
No. If we finish our midterms
by next week

01:21.474 --> 01:23.343
we will be
in Pelican Cove, Florida.

01:23.343 --> 01:24.711
That is, if you give me
the week off.

01:24.711 --> 01:26.746
Of course I will.
With all the studying
you've been doing

01:26.746 --> 01:28.081
you deserve a fun
spring break.

01:28.081 --> 01:30.550
Cruising the strip,
tanning on the beach

01:30.550 --> 01:32.085
ogling the lifeguards.

01:32.085 --> 01:34.020
Hey, can I go?

01:34.921 --> 01:36.022
Hey, Josh.

01:36.022 --> 01:37.957
Guess where you'll be
kissing me next week?

01:37.957 --> 01:39.693
Uh, on your neck?

01:39.693 --> 01:42.262
Yes, but you'll be
doing it in Pelican Cove.

01:42.262 --> 01:43.830
We're all going to Florida.

01:43.830 --> 01:44.998
All right! Yes.

01:44.998 --> 01:46.900
Hey, I've been wanting
to do some scuba diving.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.101
Now we can do it together.

01:48.101 --> 01:49.269
Oh, that would be fun.

01:49.269 --> 01:51.104
As long as we don't have
to go in the water.

01:51.104 --> 01:52.539
Salt's murder on my hair.

01:52.539 --> 01:55.709
Although I do look
fabulous in neoprene.

01:55.709 --> 01:58.044
Me, too.

01:58.044 --> 02:00.046
What about Kevin?
Are you going to invite him?

02:00.046 --> 02:02.882
I don't know. I mean,
Kevin and I haven't
been dating that long.

02:02.882 --> 02:03.550
I-I want him to go

02:03.550 --> 02:04.851
but I don't want
to put him on the spot.

02:04.851 --> 02:06.286
Oh, come on.

02:06.286 --> 02:08.221
I put guys on the spot
all the time.

02:08.221 --> 02:10.857
It's fun to watch
the blood rush to their faces.

02:10.857 --> 02:13.326
Asking Kevin to go
on our first trip
together is a big deal.

02:13.326 --> 02:14.494
I need to think about it.

02:14.494 --> 02:16.096
Hey, what's going on?

02:16.096 --> 02:18.998
Uh, we got new
hand dryers
in the bathroom.

02:18.998 --> 02:20.800
You want to come to Florida
with us for spring break?

02:20.800 --> 02:23.470
Yeah, I'm there.

02:25.972 --> 02:26.606
Morgan...!

02:26.606 --> 02:28.274
You don't have
to thank me now.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.744
But, FYI, I'm a size four.

02:34.147 --> 02:35.215
Well, thank goodness

02:35.215 --> 02:36.616
Sabrina's going to be
spending spring break

02:36.616 --> 02:37.984
working in the coffee shop.

02:37.984 --> 02:39.452
Unless someone
accidentally gave her

02:39.452 --> 02:41.087
the week off
to go to Florida.

02:41.087 --> 02:41.988
Hilda.

02:41.988 --> 02:43.623
Well, Sabrina has been
working so hard

02:43.623 --> 02:47.193
I thought she deserved a week of R&R
with her roommates and Kevin.

02:47.193 --> 02:48.728
Kevin's going, too?

02:48.728 --> 02:50.697
Let the debauchery begin.

02:50.697 --> 02:52.031
Look, let's not panic.

02:52.031 --> 02:53.967
This is Sabrina
we're talking about.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.969
A mature, responsible
college student.

02:55.969 --> 02:58.304
Well, I suppose
you're right.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.038
I mean, after all

02:59.038 --> 03:01.574
we took many a spring
break sojourn ourselves.

03:01.574 --> 03:03.777
Remember that fabulous trip
we took to the Acropolis

03:03.777 --> 03:05.845
with those adorable
fraternity brothers?

03:05.845 --> 03:06.880
Mmm.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.614
Uh-oh.

03:08.515 --> 03:09.649
Just think-- Florida.

03:09.649 --> 03:12.385
There'll be guys from all
over the Eastern seaboard.

03:12.385 --> 03:14.187
Remember, we said no talk
of spring break

03:14.187 --> 03:16.422
until after we're done
studying for our last exam.

03:16.422 --> 03:17.590
Sorry.

03:18.124 --> 03:20.093
Oh, I got the cutest
little pink bikini today.

03:20.093 --> 03:21.127
This trip is going
to be so great.

03:21.127 --> 03:22.862
Even the drive down
will be fun.

03:22.862 --> 03:24.964
Yeah, you and Kevin,
Josh and Morgan

03:24.964 --> 03:26.633
and me
and Elroy Jetson.

03:26.633 --> 03:30.003
Wow, no one's called me that
since second grade.

03:30.003 --> 03:31.304
I just wish I knew
if Kevin was going

03:31.304 --> 03:33.406
because he wants
to have fun in Florida

03:33.406 --> 03:34.841
or because he thinks of me
as his girlfriend.

03:34.841 --> 03:36.810
The guy's been dating you
for six weeks.

03:36.810 --> 03:37.644
You're his girlfriend.

03:37.644 --> 03:39.212
He wrote a song about you.

03:39.212 --> 03:41.347
He also wrote a song
about Janet Reno.

03:41.347 --> 03:42.715
You'll have
a whole week together.

03:42.715 --> 03:44.984
That should be plenty of time to
find out how he feels about you.

03:44.984 --> 03:46.820
You're right.
I just have to talk to him

03:46.820 --> 03:48.154
and ask him where he stands.

03:48.154 --> 03:50.123
And find out
if he has a brother.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.125
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

03:56.095 --> 03:57.530
What are you guys
doing here?

03:57.530 --> 03:59.699
We were...
just in the neighborhood.

03:59.699 --> 04:00.733
For no special reason.

04:00.733 --> 04:02.569
It's not like we want
to talk about Florida.

04:02.569 --> 04:05.138
You do know that they
get hurricanes there
this time of year.

04:05.138 --> 04:07.440
And mosquitoes as big
as my cousin Estelle.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.809
Okay, you didn't come here
to talk to me about the weather

04:09.809 --> 04:10.977
and bloodsucking relatives.

04:10.977 --> 04:12.278
You're right.

04:12.278 --> 04:14.447
Sabrina, it's just that we're
concerned about you going away

04:14.447 --> 04:17.217
on spring break
unchaperoned.

04:17.217 --> 04:19.752
I started thinking
about the college
vacations I took

04:19.752 --> 04:22.155
like that night in
Naples when I wound
up in a fountain

04:22.155 --> 04:24.791
with two massive
gladiators...

04:24.791 --> 04:26.292
I think I made my point.

04:26.292 --> 04:27.794
Look, there's nothing
to worry about.

04:27.794 --> 04:29.262
I'm going with all
my good friends

04:29.262 --> 04:30.830
and a guy I just
happen to be dating.

04:30.830 --> 04:33.166
It's that last part
that we're worried about.

04:33.166 --> 04:34.968
So what your saying is
you don't trust me.

04:34.968 --> 04:36.302
No, we're not saying that.

04:36.302 --> 04:38.771
It's just that sometimes young
people can get caught up

04:38.771 --> 04:41.307
in the passion
of the moment
and do things

04:41.307 --> 04:42.642
they might later regret.

04:42.642 --> 04:45.311
Like floating down a canal
in Venice wearing nothing

04:45.311 --> 04:47.981
but a fig leaf and two
single-serving pizzas.

04:47.981 --> 04:49.916
Look, just because you made
mistakes when you were young

04:49.916 --> 04:51.217
doesn't mean that I'm going to.

04:51.217 --> 04:53.553
I'm a responsible adult
and I think I've proven that

04:53.553 --> 04:55.488
time and time again.

04:55.488 --> 04:57.757
I need you to trust me.
Can you do that?

04:59.125 --> 05:00.894
Of course we can.

05:01.027 --> 05:03.029
We could just not give her
the money to go.

05:03.029 --> 05:05.198
That would work
if someone hadn't accidentally

05:05.198 --> 05:07.367
given her an advance
on her paycheck.

05:07.367 --> 05:08.368
What do you want from me?

05:08.368 --> 05:09.936
I'm accident-prone.

05:09.936 --> 05:11.271
Here's
my idea.

05:11.271 --> 05:14.274
We check into a really posh
hotel near Sabrina.

05:14.274 --> 05:18.311
You two keep an eye on her
while I enjoy a vigorous massage

05:18.311 --> 05:20.380
with hot mint oil.

05:20.380 --> 05:21.514
Sabrina
is leaving tomorrow.

05:21.514 --> 05:23.783
We've got to do
something quick.

05:24.817 --> 05:26.753
Let's see what
the magic book

05:26.753 --> 05:28.154
has under "Good, Clean Fun."

05:28.154 --> 05:29.756
I've never used that chapter.

05:29.756 --> 05:30.890
Here we go.

05:30.890 --> 05:33.126
A Good Clean Fun Consultant.

05:35.295 --> 05:37.030
Hey, kids, what's shaking?

05:37.030 --> 05:38.398
Oh, my gosh!
Frankie Avalon.

05:38.398 --> 05:40.867
I loved you in
all those beach movies.

05:40.867 --> 05:42.035
I cried when you

05:42.035 --> 05:44.437
and Annette broke up
in <i>Beach Blanket Bingo.</i>

05:44.437 --> 05:48.942
And the way you shook your hips
in <i>How to Stuff a Wild Bikini...</i>

05:49.175 --> 05:52.578
made no impression
on me whatsoever.

05:52.578 --> 05:54.480
Frankie, I've always
wanted to tell
you something.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.481
You're swell.

05:55.481 --> 05:56.282
Super swell.

05:56.282 --> 05:56.883
Well, listen, girls

05:56.883 --> 05:58.184
girls, I appreciate
all your fawning

05:58.184 --> 06:00.586
but why, exactly,
am I here?

06:00.586 --> 06:01.888
Our niece Sabrina
is going

06:01.888 --> 06:03.523
to Pelican Cove
for spring break.

06:03.523 --> 06:05.725
Pelican Cove? Cowabunga!

06:05.725 --> 06:07.260
That place is the swingingest.

06:07.260 --> 06:08.461
Is she bringing her board?

06:08.461 --> 06:10.830
No, but she is bringing
her boyfriend, Kevin.

06:10.830 --> 06:11.898
Oh, I get the picture.

06:11.898 --> 06:13.566
I got the perfect thing.

06:13.566 --> 06:16.469
Sabrina and Kevin
on the beach

06:16.469 --> 06:17.704
In the sun

06:17.704 --> 06:21.240
All they'll have
is some good, clean fun.

06:21.574 --> 06:23.509
Oh, thank you
for infusing

06:23.509 --> 06:25.678
our lives with
wholesomeness.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.347
Say, by the way,
what are you

06:27.347 --> 06:28.748
and your swinging hips
doing later?

06:28.748 --> 06:31.150
Hey! I saw them first.

06:31.150 --> 06:32.685
Oh, back off.
I saw him first.

06:32.685 --> 06:35.288
-I was the first one to see
him in his very first movie...
-I have loved him since...

06:35.288 --> 06:37.757
Crazy chicks.

06:41.494 --> 06:44.130
ROXIE:
All right! We made it
to Pelican Cove.

06:44.130 --> 06:46.165
MORGAN:
Let the parties begin.
Woo-hoo!

06:46.165 --> 06:49.002
MILES:
Is it possible to get sunstroke
through tinted glass?

06:50.370 --> 06:53.139
Spellman, it's amazing
you pulled this off.

06:53.139 --> 06:55.141
Yeah, you're awesome.

06:55.141 --> 06:57.176
As in awesome, like,
travel agent awesome

06:57.176 --> 06:59.278
or, like, long term
relationship awesome?

06:59.278 --> 07:00.713
Well, let's put it this way.

07:00.713 --> 07:03.583
I'd book all my vacations
with you.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.986
What's that
supposed to mean?

07:07.020 --> 07:08.254
Josh, take my picture.

07:08.254 --> 07:10.089
Well, hey, why don't
I take it of everyone?

07:10.089 --> 07:12.058
Come on, get in
before we mutate

07:12.058 --> 07:15.161
into crazed party animals.
Ready?

07:15.762 --> 07:16.562
All right.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.331
Wow, check out
this retro furniture.

07:18.331 --> 07:20.600
Yeah, it's so Donna Reed
meets Don Ho.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.403
I'll get us checked in.

07:23.403 --> 07:24.270
Harvey?

07:24.270 --> 07:25.338
Sabrina.

07:25.338 --> 07:27.040
What are you doing here?

07:27.040 --> 07:28.775
Checking out.
What are you doing here?

07:28.775 --> 07:30.476
Checking in.

07:30.476 --> 07:32.578
Wow, so... you look good.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.013
You haven't seen my sunburn.

07:34.013 --> 07:35.948
It's about the same
color as your hair.

07:35.948 --> 07:37.116
Which I like.

07:37.116 --> 07:38.584
Thanks.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.319
BOY:
Hey, Kinkle,
in the car.

07:40.319 --> 07:41.954
We gotta hit
the road.

07:41.954 --> 07:44.590
I'm sorry, but I
really have to go.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.126
It was great
seeing you. Oh!

07:47.126 --> 07:47.527
What's the matter?

07:47.527 --> 07:48.661
We can still hug,
can't we?

07:48.661 --> 07:49.862
Of course...

07:49.862 --> 07:53.266
as soon as I grow a new
layer of skin on my back.

07:53.266 --> 07:54.300
See ya.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.268
See ya.

07:57.136 --> 07:58.071
Hey, Red, you're up.

07:58.071 --> 07:58.805
Sorry.

07:58.805 --> 08:00.239
Welcome to the
Surfside Motel

08:00.239 --> 08:00.973
the number one home

08:00.973 --> 08:02.909
of bodacious beach bunnies
and all their honeys.

08:02.909 --> 08:05.912
Oh, well, we're the Spellman
bunny and honey party.

08:05.912 --> 08:07.447
You came to the right place.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.382
You kids are in

18:21.660 --> 18:25.731
have spent exactly 12
watusi-free seconds alone.

18:25.731 --> 18:28.233
And Morgan always has to be
the center of attention

18:28.233 --> 18:30.035
and that's not me.

18:30.035 --> 18:32.337
You know, I like just
walking along the beach

18:32.337 --> 18:34.707
maybe even having
an actual conversation.

18:34.707 --> 18:36.875
Yeah, me, too.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.611
Wow, look at that sky.

18:39.611 --> 18:41.680
Yeah, it's beautiful.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.649
And it's nice
to have someone
to watch it with.

18:43.649 --> 18:46.985
Yeah. I wish
Morgan and I
could talk

18:46.985 --> 18:48.587
the way you and I do.

18:49.788 --> 18:52.558
Uh... maybe we
should get back.

18:52.558 --> 18:54.159
Yeah.

18:54.326 --> 18:58.597
Or we could stay here
and watch the sunset.

18:58.597 --> 19:00.799
I like your idea better.
