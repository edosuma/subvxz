INSTALLED IN MY EAR.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.892
>> THERES NO RED MEAT HERE.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.788
YOU KNOW I NEED MY IRON.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.257
>> THERE IS IRON IN FISH,

20:36.260 --> 20:37.591
SWEETHEART. AND CONOR NEEDS HIS

20:37.600 --> 20:39.693
OMEGA-3s SO THAT HE CAN HEAL

20:39.700 --> 20:41.565
FASTER AFI'ER HIS SURGERY.

20:41.570 --> 20:42.639
>> OHH! AND OF COURSE HIS

20:42.640 --> 20:44.733
SURGERY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

20:44.740 --> 20:46.605
MY ANEMIA. JUST LIKE HIS HANDS

20:46.610 --> 20:48.635
WERE MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY

20:48.640 --> 20:51.473
BULIMIA OR MY AGORAPHOBIA OR--

20:51.480 --> 20:52.617
>> ANN, CAN WE PLEASE JUST HAVE

20:52.620 --> 20:53.746
ONE DINNER WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT

20:53.750 --> 20:55.012
YOUR DAMN AGORAPHOBIA? YOU

20:55.020 --> 20:56.612
REFUSED TO GET OFF THE COUCH FOR

20:56.620 --> 20:57.712
A WEEK BECAUSE THAT GUY DUMPED

20:57.720 --> 20:59.779
YOU. THATS NOT AGORAPHOBIA.

20:59.780 --> 21:02.578
>> ITS NOT ALL ABOUT YOU.

21:05.630 --> 21:06.654
WHY ARE WE SITTING ALONE AT THIS

21:06.660 --> 21:08.981
HUGE TABLE? IS IT A METAPHOR FOR

21:08.990 --> 21:10.594
THE CHASM THAT SEPARATES OUR

21:10.600 --> 21:11.635
FAMILY?

21:11.640 --> 21:12.629
>> NO. I WAS JUST SAVING SEATS

21:12.640 --> 21:13.937
FOR YOUR SPIRIT GUIDES.

21:18.940 --> 21:23.639
>> OH, MY GOD.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.641
>> WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

21:25.650 --> 21:26.742
>> IM SORRY, DAD. I KNEW

21:26.750 --> 21:27.739
NEITHER ONE OF YOU WOULD COME IF

21:27.750 --> 21:28.899
YOU KNEW THE OTHER ONE WAS GOING

21:28.910 --> 21:29.740
TO BE HERE.

21:29.750 --> 21:30.648
>> YOU WERE RIGHT.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.481
>> THATS RIGHT, SEAN, WALK OUT.

21:33.490 --> 21:34.752
ITS WHAT YOU DO BEST.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.580
>> I NEVER LEFT YOU ANNIE. THE

21:36.590 --> 21:38.319
FACT IS YOUR MOTHER WALKED OUT

21:38.320 --> 21:39.548
ON ME TWICE.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.891
>> DAD, PLEASE. LISTEN, I KNOW

21:40.900 --> 21:45.769
THIS IS HARD, BUT STAY...FOR ME.

21:45.770 --> 21:46.759
I WANT YOU ALL TO MEET MY

21:46.770 --> 21:49.728
SURGEON TOGETHER.

21:55.780 --> 21:59.773
>> UH, HOWS YOUR WIFE?

21:59.780 --> 22:01.645
>> ID RATHER NOT DISCUSS MY

22:01.650 --> 22:04.084
PERSONAL LIFE, THANK YOU. LOOK,

22:04.090 --> 22:05.739
WE STOPPED TRYING TO BE FRIENDS

22:05.750 --> 22:08.639
15 YEARS AGO. WHY START AGAIN

22:08.650 --> 22:09.844
NOW?

22:09.850 --> 22:11.750
WHY HASNT YOUR SURGEON CALLED

22:11.760 --> 22:13.352
ME? I PRACTICALLY INVENTED THIS

22:13.360 --> 22:14.759
SURGERY. THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL

22:14.760 --> 22:16.398
OF MEDICINE DID NO LESS THAN 3

22:16.400 --> 22:17.526
ARTICLES ON THE MICROSURGERY

22:17.530 --> 22:18.929
TECHNIQUES I USED TO FIX YOUR

22:18.930 --> 22:20.090
OTHER HAND.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.101
>> HE SAID HE WANTED TO DISCUSS

22:21.110 --> 22:22.099
IT WITH YOU PERSONALLY. HES

22:22.110 --> 22:24.408
VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOU, DAD.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.366
>> "IMPRESSED"? THEY MUST NOT

22:26.370 --> 22:27.564
KNOW HIM VERY WELL.

22:27.570 --> 22:30.414
>> OHH!

22:30.420 --> 22:33.571
>> OH, LOOK AT YOU. LOOK AT YOU.

22:33.580 --> 22:34.615
HUH?

22:34.620 --> 22:35.541
>> HEY.

22:35.550 --> 22:39.372
>> OH.

22:39.380 --> 22:41.826

22:51.140 --> 22:52.129

22:52.140 --> 22:53.539
>> WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS?

22:53.540 --> 22:56.429
>> THIS IS DELORA AND ESTRAN.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.432
WE MET A MONTH AGO IN DUBAI.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.976
CANT SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.845
THEY ONLY LOVE ME FOR MY MONEY.

23:02.850 --> 23:04.772
BUT THEY DONT QUIT UNTIL THE

23:04.780 --> 23:06.441
SUPER VIAGRA WEARS OFF. SO WHO

23:06.450 --> 23:10.580
GIVES A SHIT?

23:10.590 --> 23:11.409

23:15.390 --> 23:17.858
OH, MY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE DOLLY.

23:17.860 --> 23:19.509
>> OH, THANK GOD FOR THE

23:19.520 --> 23:20.521
POLYGAMY AMENDMENT.

23:20.530 --> 23:23.124
YOU CAN MARRY THEM BOTH.

23:23.130 --> 23:24.825
>> UHH. I DONT THINK ILL EVER

23:24.830 --> 23:26.866

23:29.900 --> 23:33.779
BESIDES, THIS WAY I DONT FEEL

23:33.780 --> 23:35.839
GUILTY WHEN IM CHEATING. HUH?

23:35.840 --> 23:36.738
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK ITS

23:36.740 --> 23:38.469
SHAMEFUL THAT YOU CAN MARRY 2

23:38.480 --> 23:40.482
WOMEN, BUT 2 GAY MEN STILL CANT

23:40.490 --> 23:42.640
GET MARRIED IN THIS COUNTRY.

23:42.650 --> 23:43.912
>> THEY GAYS SHOULD CONSIDER

23:43.920 --> 23:45.444
THEMSELVES LUCKY.

23:45.450 --> 23:47.839
>> THIS IS BULLSHIT. OK, YOUR

ITS THE ONLY PHOTO I HAVE WHERE

27:29.040 --> 27:33.648
WELL ALL TOGETHER.

27:33.650 --> 27:34.844
>> WHY DIDNT YOU ASK YOUR

27:34.850 --> 27:38.911
FATHER TO DO THE SURGERY?

27:38.920 --> 27:41.229
>> I THOUGHT IT WOULD UPSET YOU.

27:41.230 --> 27:43.357

27:48.990 --> 27:50.321
WHATS REALLY GOING ON? YOU WANT

27:50.330 --> 27:51.365
TO LEAVE BECAUSE CONOR DIDNT

27:51.370 --> 27:53.167
ASK YOU TO DO THE SURGERY.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.695
>> I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE IF

27:55.700 --> 27:56.359
YOUR FATHER HAD DONE THE

27:56.370 --> 27:58.065
SURGERY. WHY WOULDNT I BE?

27:58.070 --> 28:00.664
>> BECAUSE, MOM...LOOK, EVEN

THOUGH YOU ALWAYS WANTED ME

28:01.810 --> 28:06.099
TO...IVE NEVER ACCEPTED MY OWN

28:06.110 --> 28:08.249
HANDICAP. AND SO BY ASKING DAD

28:08.250 --> 28:09.376
TO DO THE SURGERY, IT WOULD HAVE

28:09.380 --> 28:11.712
LOOKED LIKE I WAS CHOOSING HIM

28:11.720 --> 28:12.459
OVER YOU NOW--

28:12.460 --> 28:14.451
>> IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

28:14.460 --> 28:16.985
>> CONOR, HAS NEVER FORGIVEN ME

28:16.990 --> 28:20.084
FOR THE DIVORCE. I UNDERSTAND.

28:20.090 --> 28:21.796
IF I HAD KEPT THE MARRIAGE

28:21.800 --> 28:23.290
TOGETHER, I COULD HAVE FIXED

28:23.300 --> 28:25.097
BOTH HIS HANDS THE FIRST TIME.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.124
>> MAYBE IF I WAS BORN WITH 2

28:26.130 --> 28:27.199
PERFECT HANDS, YOU AND DAD WOULD

28:27.200 --> 28:28.269
HAVE STAYED TOGETHER.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.261
>> OHH.

28:30.270 --> 28:34.331

YOUR FATHER AND I HAD OUR

28:36.140 --> 28:38.370
PROBLEMS LONG BEFORE YOU WERE

28:38.380 --> 28:41.440
BORN. WHAT HAPPENED 20 YEARS AGO

28:41.450 --> 28:44.317
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.787
>> THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

28:45.790 --> 28:48.145
YOU. DONT TURN IT INTO THAT.

28:48.150 --> 28:49.185
>> WISH I WOULD HAVE HEARD YOU
