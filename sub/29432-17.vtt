00:04.295 --> 00:05.338
You know what?

-You're a great person.
-I know I'm a great person!

01:20.830 --> 01:21.956
Becky, did you finish

-Hi, Becky.
-Jon.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.845
Yes, this is Becky,
one of our partners.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.097
-So--
-Founders.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.265
Yeah, so, you know,
that porta-potty issue,

01:39.349 --> 01:41.684
that's something on the long
list that that dinosaur

01:41.768 --> 01:44.896
you been stuck covering
doesn't think about.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.148
And by dinosaur,
you mean Elvis Stone,

01:47.232 --> 01:48.274
the head of the ASAs.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.943
Mm, that name
never came out of my mouth.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.027
Did it Becky?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.320
Well, I certainly
didn't get to say it.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.323
Well, maybe it didn't,
but you did schedule your event

01:55.406 --> 01:57.617
on the exact same night as his,

01:57.700 --> 02:00.328
draining all relevant talent
from the ASAs.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.496
I did that?

02:01.579 --> 02:02.872
Is that why he's on the attack,

02:02.956 --> 02:04.624
referring to BossyFest

02:04.707 --> 02:05.792
-as amateurish...
-Oh.

and a Cookie Lyon ego trip?

02:09.212 --> 02:12.632

using my name to stay relevant.

that's the only value

You know that, right?

02:16.761 --> 02:17.971

on that vermin,
Pamplemousse.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.488
Um, I just wanna
thank you guys again

39:25.571 --> 39:27.740
for coming
at such a short notice.

39:27.823 --> 39:30.659
You know, the job
of the record executive

39:30.743 --> 39:34.288
is not to put themselves first,
but to put the artist first.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.666
And Empire
has never participated

39:37.750 --> 39:39.835
in the silencing of any artist,

39:39.919 --> 39:42.505
and the ASAs'
flagrant white-balling

39:42.588 --> 39:44.882
of BossyFest will not stand.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.511
Therefore, Empire
will be joining Bossy Media

39:48.594 --> 39:51.806
in its public boycott
of the ASAs this year.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.182
We are pulling our artists

39:53.265 --> 39:55.810
from the show
and from award contention.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.646
Yes, oh, and in case
you didn't know,

39:58.729 --> 40:01.232
I personally invited
the CEO of the ASAs,

40:01.315 --> 40:03.818
Mr. Elvis Stone,
right here in the front row.

40:04.985 --> 40:06.487
Looks like he's
about to soil himself

40:06.570 --> 40:09.698
because they tried
to shut down the BossyFest,

40:09.782 --> 40:11.826
but like air we rise, honey.

40:12.326 --> 40:17.415
So if you guys love artists,
if you love good music,

40:17.498 --> 40:19.333
or you just wanna have
a good time,

40:19.417 --> 40:22.378
come down to BossyFest
and get lit!

40:22.461 --> 40:24.630
Honey,
we will be hosting on stages

40:24.713 --> 40:26.090
all across New York City.

40:26.173 --> 40:28.050
And keep in mind
that the main show

40:28.134 --> 40:31.679
will take place right here
at Empire's own Laviticus.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.557
Yes, we will see y'all there.
Questions?

40:34.640 --> 40:36.225

40:38.060 --> 40:39.186
You soft.

We're so close.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.822
-Sweetheart.
-Yeah?

40:49.905 --> 40:52.199
One more move
and the Lyons will be gone,

40:52.783 --> 40:54.577
and then you can have
your anniversary present.
