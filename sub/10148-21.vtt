01:16.953 --> 01:19.247
<i>Flight 211 now arriving
from Saint</i> Denis.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.416
I can't believe
spring break's over already.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.085
Or that Nelson's back.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.503
Come on. He's not that bad.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.026
Anyway, I promised we'd pick him up.

01:28.214 --> 01:29.548
I wonder what he brought me.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.561
Mr. Nash. Anything to declare?

01:42.853 --> 01:45.189
Yeah. Saint Denis parties hardy.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.360
I meant, do you have
any restricted items in your possession?

01:50.444 --> 01:51.444
Peg it.

01:52.530 --> 01:53.531
I got nothing to hide.

02:01.372 --> 02:02.373
What's this?

02:03.374 --> 02:04.750
Jeez, how'd that get in there?

02:06.419 --> 02:08.254
- You tell me.
- Well, I don't know.

02:08.337 --> 02:10.131
Someone must have
stuck it in at the airport.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.061
You know,
like when I went to the bathroom.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.884
You let this bag out of your sight?

02:14.093 --> 02:15.093
Ihadto.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.846
The stall was too small.
I was desperate.

02:17.263 --> 02:19.449
You gotta believe me.
I've never seen it before in my life.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.473
Honest.

02:23.102 --> 02:24.102
Go on.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.814
Next time, Mr. Nash,
keep a closer eye on your bags.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.274
Yes, sir. Definitely.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.317
Thank you, sir.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.302
Did you get it?

03:03.601 --> 03:04.602
Very good.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.520
Hold it.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.693
I shouldn't be seen
leaving work this early.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.531
Have to keep up appearances.

03:29.335 --> 03:30.335
Nelson!

03:32.046 --> 03:33.130
What took so long?

03:33.422 --> 03:35.633
Some jerk in customs
gave me the third degree.

03:36.592 --> 03:37.802
Looks like he was thorough.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.223
McGinnis. What are you doing here?

03:42.723 --> 03:43.933
Just along for the ride.

03:44.475 --> 03:45.475
Here.

03:45.851 --> 03:46.894
Make yourself useful.

03:53.484 --> 03:56.153
I just want to get home,
unpack, forget the whole...

03:58.781 --> 03:59.907
Who's nature boy?

04:09.125 --> 04:10.709
Hey, are you crazy? Let go!

04:14.755 --> 04:15.755
Terry!

04:20.511 --> 04:22.430
Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait a minute! Wait!

04:22.638 --> 04:23.514
What do you...

04:23.597 --> 04:24.597
What do you want?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.476
Who... Who are you?

04:29.103 --> 04:30.103
Hey.

04:32.731 --> 04:33.731
Stop. Stop.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.986
Where is it?
Where's the glass container?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.864
- I don't know.
- Liar!

04:43.742 --> 04:44.742
Please don't.

04:45.161 --> 04:46.287
The customs guy took it.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.370
Honest.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.015
Nelson, are you okay?

05:07.391 --> 05:09.185
I could use some clean shorts.

05:10.019 --> 05:11.479
Stay with him. I'll get help.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.543
Stalker. Game's over.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.676
- Stop.
- Why?

05:42.760 --> 05:44.762
So you can attack
more innocent bystanders?

05:48.098 --> 05:49.099
You misjudge me.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.523
I don't think so.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.193
Enough.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.113
Much as I would relish hunting you,

06:03.489 --> 06:05.491
this time, I seek a different prey.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.867
Yeah, right.

06:06.951 --> 06:07.952
He's telling the truth.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.703
Bennet.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.541
He's working for us now, Batman.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.876
Tracking 3 man named Falseface.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.335
Falseface?

06:17.586 --> 06:19.588
An agent-for-hire
who can change identities

06:19.672 --> 06:21.257
the way most people change clothes.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.467
He's working for Kobra.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.594
It's a powerful
ultra-secret organization

06:25.678 --> 06:28.430
that uses cutting-edge technology
for extortion and terrorism.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.559
If we don't pay a ransom
of ten billion credits,

06:31.642 --> 06:34.103
they've threatened to release
a deadly super-virus.

06:34.687 --> 06:35.729
You're kidding, right?

06:36.272 --> 06:37.272
I Wish.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.484
<i>Last week, Kobra tested the virus</i>

06:40.568 --> 06:42.444
<i>on an island off the coast
of Saint Denis.</i>

06:43.612 --> 06:46.699
<i>The result,
total biological devastation.</i>

06:47.241 --> 06:50.160
<i>Crops, livestock, everything.</i>

06:53.706 --> 06:54.706
<i>It wasn't pretty.</i>

06:57.835 --> 07:00.588
<i>Falseface's job
was to smuggle the virus into Gotham,</i>

07:00.921 --> 07:03.257
<i>so we turned to the only man
who could track him down.</i>

07:08.846 --> 07:10.347
The Stalker agreed to help us.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.641
Unfortunately, we were too late.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.185
By the time I picked up his trail,

07:15.269 --> 07:18.522
Falseface had passed the virus container
off to a high school student.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.440
Time is running out.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.985
If we can't find Falseface
in the next hour,

07:23.402 --> 07:25.863
we're going to have
12 million people in a hot zone.

07:43.589 --> 07:44.589
I don't like it.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.967
This freak tried to hunt me down
like a wild animal.

07:47.051 --> 07:48.218
What if he goes psycho again?

07:49.511 --> 07:51.347
<i>Right now,
you've got bigger problems.</i>

07:51.847 --> 07:54.224
If you don't find Falseface
in the next hour,

07:55.517 --> 07:56.560
we'll all be dead.

07:56.894 --> 07:57.936
<i>Any suggestions?</i>

08:03.859 --> 08:05.653
Try the Muscle City Sweat Shop.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.665
According to my sources,
this used to be a major Kobra nest.

08:21.794 --> 08:22.794
After you.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.213
You don't trust me.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.298
You were out to kill me, remember?

08:26.674 --> 08:29.093
There are worse things
than an honorable death.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.679
Betcha it's a short list.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.193
Score.

09:35.701 --> 09:36.861
Wait here. I'll check it out.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.546
Kobra Command warns us to be ready.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.673
The virus will spread quickly
when they release it.

09:50.841 --> 09:51.841
Oh, no.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.661
So what part of "Wait here"
didn't you understand?

10:19.953 --> 10:20.954
Never hesitate.

10:21.872 --> 10:24.458
In thejungle, it's kill or be killed.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.210
This isn't the jungle.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.421
And this isn't Falseface.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.340
We can't even ask where he is.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.135
Perhaps I was impatient.

10:35.928 --> 10:36.928
You think?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.597
There's gotta be a clue somewhere.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.974
Every pack has it's alpha dog.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.893
You could see it in their eyes.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.646
They followed this one.

10:58.992 --> 10:59.992
What's that?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.703
Looks like a floor plan.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.833
"Gotham Manufacturers Plastics."

11:06.625 --> 11:07.625
Plastics?

11:16.051 --> 11:17.469
And <i>Malkavich takes</i> the <i>pass</i>

11:17.553 --> 11:18.971
<i>and checks off to midcourt.</i>

11:19.054 --> 11:21.640
<i>He passes off to Harrington,
who looks for an opening.</i>

11:21.723 --> 11:23.363
<i>Harrington is blocked
by Miller and Brown,</i>

11:23.392 --> 11:25.310
<i>and has to pass the ball to Owens.</i>

11:25.394 --> 11:26.979
<i>Owens breaks free and takes the ball...</i>

11:27.062 --> 11:28.730
Hey, Frank. Back from rounds early?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.941
No. It's later than you think.

11:31.775 --> 11:32.775
He <i>shoots.</i>

11:34.403 --> 11:35.904
<i>And he scores!</i>

11:45.914 --> 11:46.914
Clear to enter.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.353
Check the unmarked creds.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.274
They must be worth millions.

12:12.524 --> 12:15.986
And to us,
they'll soon be worth much, much more.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.069
How's that?

12:17.279 --> 12:19.281
We're going to coat them with the virus.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.532
It's really quite simple.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.205
<i>These creds are used
for every kind of purchase.</i>

12:29.207 --> 12:30.959
<i>They are passed from hand to hand.</i>

12:31.293 --> 12:32.628
<i>And with every transaction,</i>

12:32.711 --> 12:35.172
<i>the virus will be
transmitted on contact.</i>

12:37.215 --> 12:40.594
If the government is foolish enough
to refuse our demands,

12:40.677 --> 12:43.305
there will be no way
to stop the disease.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.722
Wanna bet?

13:02.699 --> 13:03.699
The virus!

13:20.801 --> 13:21.801
Batman!

13:39.611 --> 13:41.071
The virus. Did you...

13:42.990 --> 13:44.157
Yeah, I saved it.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.703
And thanks for your concern.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.085
Call your pal Bennet.
Tell him the worst is over.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.128
Is it?

13:56.211 --> 13:57.211
Hello.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.922
We just kicked your scaly butts.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.507
He knows something.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.049
What?

14:04.845 --> 14:06.013
It's not over, is it?

14:06.221 --> 14:07.472
What have you done?

14:14.104 --> 14:15.105
Tell me.

14:15.564 --> 14:16.606
It's Falseface.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.233
He's been infected.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.320
He's a carrier, but he doesn't know it.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.449
It was our backup plan
in case your government resisted.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.035
Soon, he'll become
virulently contagious.

14:33.165 --> 14:34.499
He'll never find him.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.084
Kobra has won.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.853
He could be anywhere.
There are hundreds, thousands.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.438
I'll find him.

15:20.921 --> 15:21.921
There.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.007
You see him? But how?

15:25.050 --> 15:26.301
My grenade marked him.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.886
He won't escape.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.307
Stop!

15:34.601 --> 15:36.645
Before you infect the entire city.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.147
- What?
- You have the sickness.

15:39.648 --> 15:40.648
Yeah, right.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.291
You okay?

16:00.418 --> 16:03.255
Continue the hunt. He must not escape.

16:25.694 --> 16:26.694
No sign of him.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.697
Keep looking. He's there somewhere.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.324
Yeah, but where?

16:33.827 --> 16:34.827
Wait a minute.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.078
Nelson?

16:43.503 --> 16:44.629
How did you know?

16:45.213 --> 16:46.339
Not enough pimples.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.528
Terry!

17:12.574 --> 17:13.574
I'm okay.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.829
<i>And Falseface?</i>

17:21.499 --> 17:23.585
He's here. I can feel it.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.484
Come out. You need help.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.228
I won't let you infect others.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.311
Argh!

18:40.328 --> 18:44.124
You think my face looks bad?
Wait till I'm done with yours.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.880
It's the virus.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.094
Impossible.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.014
And after all I've done,
Kobra wouldn't...

18:59.514 --> 19:00.514
They couldn't...

19:00.765 --> 19:02.976
What did you expect
from a pack of vipers?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.937
<i>No'. No'. No'.!</i>

19:07.188 --> 19:08.188
Wait.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.110
<i>McGinnis, are you still there?</i>

19:13.820 --> 19:15.864
Yeah, but I'm toast.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.114
Batman.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.205
There you are.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.007
Hurry.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.237
You risked your neck to save me.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.739
It was not your time.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.825
When you die, it will be by my hand,

20:00.909 --> 20:03.036
and my hand alone.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.914
Thanks. I guess.
