WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:03.378
Hey, you built me a shelf.

00:01.293 --> 00:03.378
That's so nice.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.005
It was anything but nice.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.005
I kept accidentally

00:05.046 --> 00:06.423
using your crazy toothpaste.

00:06.465 --> 00:07.549
What's so crazy

00:06.465 --> 00:07.549
about my toothpaste?

00:07.591 --> 00:09.050
- It's cinnamon.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.050
- So what?

00:09.092 --> 00:10.886
I don't like cinnamon.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.886
I like normal flavor.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.596
And what exactly

00:10.928 --> 00:12.596
is this normal flavor?

00:12.638 --> 00:15.015
- You know, striped.

00:12.638 --> 00:15.015
- Striped is not a flavor.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.892
It is in the toothpaste world.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.435
Ooh, the toothpaste world.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.187
Is that anything

00:18.477 --> 00:20.187
like Who-ville?

00:20.228 --> 00:22.021
[sighs]

00:20.228 --> 00:22.021
I'm exhausted.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.649
I'm exhilarated.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.275
You know,

00:23.691 --> 00:25.275
you don't have to do this.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.902
Hey, going to bed early

00:26.944 --> 00:28.403
once in a while

00:26.944 --> 00:28.403
is good for you.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.030
I have to get up at 4:00.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.030
You don't.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.699
Yes, I know,

00:30.071 --> 00:31.699
but every night

00:31.740 --> 00:33.367
you have early deliveries

00:31.740 --> 00:33.367
is a night we spend apart.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.703
And seriously,

00:33.408 --> 00:35.703
where is the good in that?

00:35.744 --> 00:36.996
Okay.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.001
- Night.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.963
[sighs]

00:52.845 --> 00:54.972
Man, is it quiet.

00:52.845 --> 00:54.972
Do you hear how quiet it is?

00:55.014 --> 00:56.724
- Mm-hmm.

00:55.014 --> 00:56.724
- Do you have a pin?

00:56.765 --> 00:58.266
- Cause I want to hear it drop.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.266
- No pins.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.352
It's okay, sorry.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.478
So, okay.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.478
Goodnight.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.064
[clears throat]

01:04.105 --> 01:05.566
[sighs]

01:09.152 --> 01:13.156
Hey...Luke,

01:09.152 --> 01:13.156
why don't you have a TV?

01:13.198 --> 01:14.491
I have a TV.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.284
No, I mean in here,

01:14.533 --> 01:16.284
in the bedroom.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.746
- So you can watch TV in bed.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.746
- I don't watch TV in bed.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.832
Studies show that

01:18.787 --> 01:21.832
it's not good for your sleep.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.542
What studies?

01:23.584 --> 01:26.420
Watching TV in bed screws up

01:23.584 --> 01:26.420
your REM sleep patterns.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.380
But Charlie Rose,

01:26.461 --> 01:28.380
Jon Stewart

01:28.422 --> 01:29.506
Pink Lady and Jeff.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.008
All screw up

01:29.548 --> 01:31.008
your REM sleep.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.801
How does Charlie Rose

01:31.050 --> 01:32.801
screw up your REM sleep?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.678
Because he's always got

01:32.843 --> 01:34.678
some guy on pushing a book

01:34.720 --> 01:36.471
about how everything's

01:34.720 --> 01:36.471
going to hell

01:36.513 --> 01:38.306
and they're gonna

01:36.513 --> 01:38.306
pass a law

01:38.348 --> 01:39.725
where everyone

01:38.348 --> 01:39.725
with a nose ring

01:39.767 --> 01:41.852
is gonna get shipped off

01:39.767 --> 01:41.852
to a work camp in China.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.102
And suddenly you're depressed

01:43.144 --> 01:44.605
and thinking

01:43.144 --> 01:44.605
we're all gonna die.

01:44.646 --> 01:45.940
And don't drink the water.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.816
'And there's anthrax

01:45.981 --> 01:47.816
in my bagel'

01:47.858 --> 01:49.443
'And bam!

01:47.858 --> 01:49.443
There goes your REM sleep.'

01:49.484 --> 01:51.152
Or Mel Brooks is on

01:51.194 --> 01:52.613
and he is so funny.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.323
And you think, what a wonderful

01:52.654 --> 01:55.323
world we live in.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.200
That there's a Mel Brooks

01:55.365 --> 01:57.200
to go to sleep to.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.953
Mel Brooks is never

01:57.242 --> 01:58.953
on Charlie Rose

01:58.994 --> 02:00.746
and when he is on,

01:58.994 --> 02:00.746
he's talking about Nazis.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.748
And then you go to sleep

02:00.788 --> 02:02.748
and you dream about Nazis.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.291
And they all look like

02:02.790 --> 02:04.291
Nathan Lane.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.793
And you're creeped out

02:04.332 --> 02:05.793
for days.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.086
You know what ruins

02:05.834 --> 02:07.086
your REM sleep

02:07.127 --> 02:08.754
is those articles

02:07.127 --> 02:08.754
about REM sleep.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.130
And you know

02:08.796 --> 02:10.130
what could help you

02:10.171 --> 02:12.173
forget those articles

02:10.171 --> 02:12.173
about REM sleep?

02:12.215 --> 02:15.010
- What?

02:12.215 --> 02:15.010
- A television.

02:15.052 --> 02:18.931
- Say goodnight, Gracie.

02:15.052 --> 02:18.931
- Goodnight, Gracie.

- Move butt, please.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.787
- In a minute.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.914
- What's wrong with Doyle?

03:23.829 --> 03:25.914
- Mitchum Huntzberger just left.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.958
- Logan's dad?

03:25.956 --> 03:27.958
- My entire body is numb.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.668
- What was he doing here?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.295
Busting my chops,

03:29.710 --> 03:32.295
which are now numb.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.506
My god. My chops

03:32.337 --> 03:34.506
are completely numb.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.133
Don't speak.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.218
So, Mitchum Huntzberger

03:36.175 --> 03:38.218
stopped by just to make

03:38.259 --> 03:40.387
various parts of

03:38.259 --> 03:40.387
Doyle's body insensate?

03:40.428 --> 03:41.847
He's a deep-pocket alumnus.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.598
Every few months,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.598
Yale reels guys like him

03:43.640 --> 03:45.184
in for banquets and luncheons.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.894
And he's more into New York

03:45.225 --> 03:46.894
to throw some party

03:46.935 --> 03:48.812
for Seymour Hersh

03:46.935 --> 03:48.812
on Friday night.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.313
- Lil' faster.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.313
- 'Seymour Hersh'?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.648
The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh?

03:51.690 --> 03:53.650
- Wow.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.650
- The man owns 13 newspapers.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.194
My best contact

03:53.692 --> 03:55.194
in the business

03:55.235 --> 03:56.904
and I fell like

03:55.235 --> 03:56.904
a house of cards.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.947
Made that joke about Abu Ghraib.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.947
God, that was inappropriate.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.657
It wasn't supposed to be a ha ha

04:00.699 --> 04:02.576
funny Abu Ghraib joke.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.576
Stop beating yourself up.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.911
Then he busted me

04:02.617 --> 04:03.911
on the fact that

04:03.952 --> 04:05.620
Logan hasn't had

04:03.952 --> 04:05.620
a by line all year.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.956
Wants me to light a fire

04:05.662 --> 04:07.956
under him to get him to write.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.958
"I'd like to hand my business

04:07.998 --> 04:09.958
over to my son, Doyle."

04:10.000 --> 04:11.543
"So it'd be nice if he knew

04:10.000 --> 04:11.543
something about it."

04:11.585 --> 04:13.503
He's gonna pass his empire

04:11.585 --> 04:13.503
on to that playboy cad

04:13.545 --> 04:14.838
while a rising star

04:13.545 --> 04:14.838
such as Doyle

04:14.880 --> 04:16.506
is standing

04:14.880 --> 04:16.506
right before him.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.633
In a pool of my own sweat.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.633
See, it's kind of a minus.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.094
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.179
Now I 'm Logan's

04:20.135 --> 04:22.179
journalistic godfather.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.598
I can't get the punk to show up,

04:22.221 --> 04:24.598
never mind write a story.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.724
Do you even know

04:24.639 --> 04:25.724
if he can write?

04:25.766 --> 04:26.808
Oh, he can write.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.476
Actually an excellent writer.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.604
How's that for God giving

04:28.518 --> 04:30.604
with both hands, huh?

04:30.645 --> 04:32.231
Every now and then,

04:30.645 --> 04:32.231
usually when he gets the flu

04:32.313 --> 04:34.191
or the clap and can't party,

04:32.313 --> 04:34.191
he'll throw us a bone

04:34.233 --> 04:36.235
and write something

04:34.233 --> 04:36.235
and it's always good.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.195
Damn good, stupid bastard.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.780
Well, you are his editor, Doyle.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.406
Talk to him.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.406
Assign him something.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.491
I did, he was supposed

04:41.448 --> 04:43.491
to cover the student uproar

04:43.533 --> 04:45.202
over Assistant Professor

04:43.533 --> 04:45.202
Roarke resigning.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.579
- And?

04:45.244 --> 04:47.579
- And he said, "thank you."

04:47.621 --> 04:49.164
Left the room,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.164
and I heard him laughing

04:49.206 --> 04:50.249
all the way down the hall.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.000
I haven't seen him here since.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.460
I don't know what to do.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.336
Um, Doyle, I just finished

04:53.501 --> 04:55.336
that piece

04:55.378 --> 04:57.131
on the dissatisfaction

04:55.378 --> 04:57.131
of the faculty

04:57.172 --> 04:59.382
with the tenure system

04:57.172 --> 04:59.382
and I bet a lot of my notes

04:59.424 --> 05:00.675
would overlap

04:59.424 --> 05:00.675
with Logan's story.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.261
Point, Gilmore, point?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.845
Well if you want,

05:02.302 --> 05:03.845
I could arrange to get together

05:03.887 --> 05:05.264
with Logan, share

05:03.887 --> 05:05.264
my notes with him.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.681
Maybe it could get him started.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.100
Really? You'd do that?

05:08.142 --> 05:09.434
Sure, I mean,

05:08.142 --> 05:09.434
if it would help you out.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.061
Gilmore, I'm loving you

05:09.476 --> 05:11.061
at this moment.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.729
- Moment's over.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.729
- Moment's over. Thanks.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.689
Sure boss, anything

05:12.771 --> 05:14.689
for the team.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.822
[sighs]

05:21.863 --> 05:24.241
Okay, everyone remember

05:21.863 --> 05:24.241
your time cards.

05:24.283 --> 05:27.077
Punch in, punch out,

05:24.283 --> 05:27.077
including lunch and breaks.

05:27.119 --> 05:30.872
Okay, now, next on the agenda

05:27.119 --> 05:30.872
is something very exciting.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.749
The Dragonfly inn's

05:30.914 --> 05:32.749
first official

05:32.791 --> 05:34.209
sexual-harassment seminar.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.170
Finally, yes, good.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.170
Talk to them.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.839
Sexual harassment is bad,

05:36.211 --> 05:38.839
so no one touch anyone

05:38.880 --> 05:41.675
in any funny places

05:38.880 --> 05:41.675
unless specifically asked.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.884
- Moving on.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.884
- 'That's it?'

05:42.926 --> 05:44.303
That's the seminar?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.221
Where's the speech

05:44.343 --> 05:46.221
about people

05:46.263 --> 05:49.016
not ogling other people

05:46.263 --> 05:49.016
like an object of desire?

05:49.057 --> 05:52.019
'How about explaining that

05:49.057 --> 05:52.019
the way some people walk'

05:52.060 --> 05:54.688
with a sway or a bounce,

05:52.060 --> 05:54.688
it is natural.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.316
Just because we work out

05:54.729 --> 05:57.316
and we take Pilates--

05:57.356 --> 05:59.860
No one touch Michel.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.860
Moving on.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.736
[clear throats]

05:59.901 --> 06:01.736
uh, Billy, Adam

06:01.778 --> 06:03.864
um, oh, you've got to remember

06:01.778 --> 06:03.864
to securely lock

06:03.905 --> 06:06.241
the padlock on the stables,

06:03.905 --> 06:06.241
not just hook it on.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.161
'Cletus has figured out how

06:06.283 --> 06:09.161
to push it off with his nose'

06:09.203 --> 06:11.705
and two days in a row

06:09.203 --> 06:11.705
I found him at reception.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.414
Now, if he could just

06:11.746 --> 06:13.414
check people in

06:13.456 --> 06:15.042
that would be

06:13.456 --> 06:15.042
a different story but...

06:15.083 --> 06:16.877
..until then, umm

06:16.918 --> 06:19.420
lock the stable

06:16.918 --> 06:19.420
and check the lock and..

06:19.462 --> 06:21.589
Kirk, what are you

06:19.462 --> 06:21.589
doing here?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.424
- Staff meeting.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.424
- You don't work here.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.635
I might like to go into

06:23.466 --> 06:25.635
hotel management someday.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.470
And I figured this was

06:25.677 --> 06:27.470
a good place to learn.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.389
Aw, Kirk, you can't

06:27.512 --> 06:30.389
just crash a staff meeting.

06:30.431 --> 06:33.685
Outsiders cannot crash

06:30.431 --> 06:33.685
staff meetings.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.436
I'm learning so much.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.232
Okay, anything else to discuss

06:35.478 --> 06:38.232
before we wrap it up here?

06:38.273 --> 06:39.900
Yes.

06:39.941 --> 06:43.486
We have a problem with

06:39.941 --> 06:43.486
some honor bar discrepancies.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.114
For the past few weeks,

06:43.528 --> 06:46.114
after I have checked a room

06:46.156 --> 06:47.991
and found the honor bar intact.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.743
the next day Toblerones

06:48.033 --> 06:49.743
are missing.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.036
What?

06:51.078 --> 06:53.663
Only Toblerones

06:51.078 --> 06:53.663
and only in certain rooms.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.832
- I think we have thieves.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.832
- Or guests.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.667
No, these are not

06:55.874 --> 06:57.667
the guests.

06:57.709 --> 06:58.793
The disappearances

06:57.709 --> 06:58.793
are happening in rooms

06:58.835 --> 07:00.628
no one is staying in.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.756
I think we have thieves

07:00.670 --> 07:02.756
and it's obviously

07:02.797 --> 07:04.383
'an inside job.'

07:04.423 --> 07:06.134
'This person is waiting

07:04.423 --> 07:06.134
till I've made my rounds.'

07:06.176 --> 07:07.510
'They're waiting

07:06.176 --> 07:07.510
till I check my list.'

07:07.552 --> 07:09.263
They're waiting

07:07.552 --> 07:09.263
till I initial my list

07:09.304 --> 07:12.432
and only then do they steal

07:09.304 --> 07:12.432
the Toblerones.

07:12.473 --> 07:13.808
Maybe you counted wrong.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.685
I say we install

07:13.850 --> 07:15.685
surveillance cameras.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.854
'Fingerprint the staff,

07:15.727 --> 07:17.854
run the prints through the FBI'

07:17.896 --> 07:19.356
and have mandatory searches

07:19.398 --> 07:21.608
before they leave

07:19.398 --> 07:21.608
at the end of their shift.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.151
Oh, well,

07:21.649 --> 07:23.151
that sounds great.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.945
Everybody drop your pants

07:23.193 --> 07:24.945
for Michel before you leave.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.071
Meeting adjourned.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.448
[indistinct chattering]

07:31.034 --> 07:32.577
No food spread?

07:32.619 --> 07:34.495
The staff meetings

07:32.619 --> 07:34.495
at Connecticut Light and Power

07:34.537 --> 07:36.998
always have

07:34.537 --> 07:36.998
a lovely food spread.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.919
Nice bagels,

07:37.040 --> 07:40.919
an assortment of schmear.

07:44.672 --> 07:45.757
- Hey, Kyon.

07:44.672 --> 07:45.757
- I'm busy.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.008
so, quick,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.008
what do you got?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.427
Many things,

07:47.050 --> 07:48.427
these come to house.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.304
Mrs. Kim throw directly

07:48.468 --> 07:50.304
in trash.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.431
My Sam Ash catalogs.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.431
What's that smell?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.349
They land in old fish

07:52.472 --> 07:54.349
and bok choy.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.269
Figures.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.269
What else you got?

07:57.311 --> 07:58.645
My old Madonna t-shirt!

07:58.686 --> 08:00.105
Mrs. Kim use as a rag.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.815
Says little whore's face

08:00.147 --> 08:01.815
good to scrub scum.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.524
I wore this ironically,

08:01.856 --> 08:03.524
by the way.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.069
I was never into her,

08:03.566 --> 08:06.069
not my thing.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.113
- Anything else, Kyon?

08:06.111 --> 08:08.113
- Overheard conversation.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.157
Mrs. Kim having Lunar New Year

08:08.155 --> 08:10.157
at her house this year.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.908
- She expect you to come.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.908
- Oh, she does?

08:11.950 --> 08:14.202
She says not coming is same

08:11.950 --> 08:14.202
as spitting on ancestors

08:14.244 --> 08:15.662
and ancestors no like spit.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.538
Expects me to come?

08:15.703 --> 08:17.538
Unbelievable.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.791
After she attacks my boyfriend

08:17.580 --> 08:19.791
on the street

08:19.833 --> 08:21.418
damning him

08:19.833 --> 08:21.418
to the fires of hell

08:21.460 --> 08:23.044
and swimming

08:21.460 --> 08:23.044
with carnivorous dogs.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.880
And now she expects me

08:23.086 --> 08:25.880
to smile and curtsy

08:25.922 --> 08:27.007
and just go to

08:25.922 --> 08:27.007
Lunar New Year dinner

08:27.048 --> 08:28.758
like nothing happened.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.758
Nice huh?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.385
Whoa, I not your sounding board.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.595
I deliver scoop, you give me

08:30.427 --> 08:32.595
Monte Cristo sandwich.

08:32.637 --> 08:33.888
Fine. Sit over there.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.101
There are some

08:36.891 --> 08:38.101
really good ones here.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.269
Definitely.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.312
Oh, our band pictures,

08:39.311 --> 08:40.312
how are they?

08:40.354 --> 08:41.604
They're all good.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.814
Except the one of you

08:41.646 --> 08:42.814
bending over

08:42.856 --> 08:44.149
and looking

08:42.856 --> 08:44.149
between your legs.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.485
I was just seeing

08:44.191 --> 08:46.485
what works.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.111
I like this one.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.446
Tree's covering my face.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.156
Come on, dude,

08:49.488 --> 08:51.156
the good of the many.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.074
- What do you like, Lane?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.074
- I don't like any of them.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.868
- What?

08:53.116 --> 08:54.868
- You guys look good, I mean.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.911
Not the Brian with his face

08:54.909 --> 08:56.911
between his legs one.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.538
Or the profile one

08:56.953 --> 08:58.538
where you've got

08:58.579 --> 08:59.956
your finger in your mouth

08:58.579 --> 08:59.956
and the peek-a-boo look.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.791
Right, peek-a-boo.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.791
That's what it is.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.251
I was experimenting.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.296
- But I don't look good.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.296
- What are you talking about?

09:06.338 --> 09:08.298
You look totally cool,

09:06.338 --> 09:08.298
like a real chick.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.590
I look like

09:08.340 --> 09:09.590
the Korean Buddy Holly.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.967
Buddy Holly was cool.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.886
Buddy Holly was not

09:11.009 --> 09:12.886
an attractive man.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.388
I find him attractive.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.930
Dude, don't say

09:14.429 --> 09:15.930
every thought out loud.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.683
- Can we retake them?

09:15.972 --> 09:18.683
- Like $37 just grows on trees?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.477
You're being too hard

09:18.725 --> 09:20.477
on yourself.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.229
Totally Lane,

09:20.519 --> 09:22.229
we're not Maroon Five.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.605
We're The Gee Whiz Slicky Boys.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.605
We don't want to look all fake.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.940
No, but halfway decent

09:24.647 --> 09:25.940
would be nice.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.275
Lighten up.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.275
They work.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.985
Miss, some more coffee, please?

09:29.027 --> 09:30.737
At least she didn't say mister.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.240
The lease on my Mercedes

09:30.778 --> 09:33.240
is up next month.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.866
Do you want to buy it?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.993
I finally have the seat setting

09:34.908 --> 09:36.993
where I like it.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.828
I'll make the

09:37.035 --> 09:38.828
arrangements tomorrow.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.539
Thank you, Richard.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.750
Now, ah, we need to schedule

09:40.580 --> 09:43.750
work on the water heater.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.835
Ah, I was wondering if Friday

09:43.791 --> 09:45.835
morning would work for you.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.295
Let me look.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.963
They estimate the work

09:47.337 --> 09:48.963
to be about an hour.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.798
Which means they'll

09:49.005 --> 09:50.798
be done in June.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.842
Oh, no, I have a hair

09:50.840 --> 09:52.842
appointment Friday morning.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.052
'For what?'

09:54.094 --> 09:55.762
What do you mean,

09:54.094 --> 09:55.762
"for what?"

09:55.803 --> 09:57.805
- Your hair looks perfect to me.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.805
- Oh, now.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.016
Well, I can arrange

09:57.847 --> 10:00.016
for Robert to let the workmen in

10:00.058 --> 10:01.560
and supervise it,

10:00.058 --> 10:01.560
if that works for you.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.270
Well, that would be fine.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.270
Thank you, Richard.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.105
You're welcome, Emily.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.440
What's next on the agenda?

10:06.481 --> 10:08.900
The Modern Museum gala

10:06.481 --> 10:08.900
is coming up.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.069
Oh yes, Martin Doorman

10:08.942 --> 10:11.069
is being honored this year.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.904
And Sugar Farthington

10:11.111 --> 10:12.904
is organizing it.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.532
Well, if Sugar's organizing it,

10:12.946 --> 10:15.532
then, of course, you should go.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.325
If Martin's being honored,

10:15.574 --> 10:17.325
then you should go.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.868
Sugar's one of your

10:17.367 --> 10:18.868
closest friends.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.703
Martin is one of your

10:18.910 --> 10:20.703
most trusted colleagues.

10:20.745 --> 10:24.458
Well, then, perhaps

10:20.745 --> 10:24.458
we should both attend.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.543
It does seem to be

10:24.499 --> 10:26.543
the sensible thing to do.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.462
All right.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.462
Then we'll both attend.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.963
Fine.

10:30.004 --> 10:34.050
Um, so, have we discussed

10:30.004 --> 10:34.050
the water heater?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.385
Yes, we have.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.095
Ah. More water?

10:41.433 --> 10:42.767
[instrumental music]

10:47.021 --> 10:49.690
- Hey, Ace.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.690
- Mm.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.901
Hi, Logan.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.901
I didn't see you there.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.361
Hey. Um, how are you?

10:53.403 --> 10:54.404
I'm good.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.989
Oh, good.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.616
Well, good.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.951
Okay, so, good.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.951
Um, here they are.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.953
These are the notes

10:59.993 --> 11:01.953
for one story?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.788
Yeah, I'm kind of

11:01.995 --> 11:03.788
a note freak.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.625
Man, Ace, I'm impressed

11:03.830 --> 11:06.625
and partially terrified.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.503
Okay. Well, I've divided

11:06.666 --> 11:09.503
them up into sections.

11:09.544 --> 11:12.005
So interviews, research,

11:09.544 --> 11:12.005
statistics.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.881
I wasn't sure

11:12.046 --> 11:13.881
what you already had.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.675
I figured there's something here

11:13.923 --> 11:16.675
to can help you with your story.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.136
I hope you're getting

11:16.717 --> 11:18.136
extra credit for this.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.678
Oh, it's nothing.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.264
It seems like a lot of work

11:19.720 --> 11:21.264
on your part going though

11:21.306 --> 11:23.266
this stuff organizing

11:21.306 --> 11:23.266
it for me.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.893
Well, I 'm kind of

11:23.308 --> 11:25.893
an organization freak, too.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.145
Plus I 'm sure

11:25.935 --> 11:27.145
it wasn't your idea

11:27.187 --> 11:28.480
to give up your evening

11:27.187 --> 11:28.480
like this.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.483
To come here and meet me.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.483
Was it?

11:31.525 --> 11:34.027
Um, I'm just doing a little

11:31.525 --> 11:34.027
public service, that's all.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.570
- Public service?

11:34.068 --> 11:35.570
- Yes.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.696
Doyle looked like

11:35.612 --> 11:37.696
he was about to liquefy

11:37.738 --> 11:39.366
after your dad

11:37.738 --> 11:39.366
talked to him.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.576
So I chose to stop that

11:39.407 --> 11:41.576
from happening

11:41.618 --> 11:43.286
for the sake of

11:41.618 --> 11:43.286
the janitorial staff.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.581
Yeah. He has a thing

11:43.328 --> 11:46.581
for by lines, my father.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.625
Apparently, he

11:46.623 --> 11:48.625
has plans for you.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.710
Yes. Isn't that thrilling?

11:48.667 --> 11:51.710
Sorry Doyle took the hit.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.712
My dad can be a bit of a bully

11:51.752 --> 11:53.712
when he wants something.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.714
He's a very interesting man.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.801
- You met him?

11:55.756 --> 11:58.801
- No, I've just read about him.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.220
I mean, he's a big guy.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.763
Maybe, you'll get

12:00.261 --> 12:02.763
to meet him someday.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.517
Oh, did I show you

12:02.805 --> 12:05.517
how I divided these up?

12:05.559 --> 12:08.228
Interviews, research, um--

12:08.269 --> 12:09.437
So, how come

12:08.269 --> 12:09.437
I never see you around?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.105
- I'm around.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.105
- Yeah? Where?

12:11.147 --> 12:13.441
Class, coffee cart,

12:11.147 --> 12:13.441
the student store

12:13.483 --> 12:14.901
when I run out of thumbtacks.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.611
Wow. Thrilling life.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.530
- I'm really not that boring.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.530
- Oh, I know you're not boring.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.990
Oh, Doyle told me

12:18.572 --> 12:20.990
that your dad

12:21.032 --> 12:22.576
is throwing a party

12:21.032 --> 12:22.576
for Seymour Hersh?

12:22.617 --> 12:23.993
Now, you want to talk

12:22.617 --> 12:23.993
about boring..

12:24.035 --> 12:25.495
How can meeting

12:24.035 --> 12:25.495
Seymour Hersh be boring?

12:25.537 --> 12:28.456
I love him. I read "My Lai 4"

12:25.537 --> 12:28.456
when I was 12

12:28.498 --> 12:30.250
and I've been obsessed

12:28.498 --> 12:30.250
with him ever since.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.210
You read a book about the My Lai

12:30.291 --> 12:32.210
massacre when you were 12?

12:32.252 --> 12:33.712
I polished off "Nancy Drew"

12:32.252 --> 12:33.712
that year, too.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.796
Well, I guarantee

12:33.752 --> 12:35.796
these parties always turn

12:35.838 --> 12:38.174
into a bunch of drunks

12:35.838 --> 12:38.174
discussing stocks, cars

12:38.216 --> 12:39.884
and their latest friends

12:38.216 --> 12:39.884
to be indicted, it's boring.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.220
I just go, take a date

12:39.926 --> 12:42.220
so I have somebody to talk to

12:42.262 --> 12:44.305
and bail as soon

12:42.262 --> 12:44.305
as my dad's back is turned.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.432
Oh, so, you're going?

12:45.473 --> 12:46.725
Daddy says.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.560
- Wow. Lucky.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.560
- No.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.853
To spend the evening

12:48.602 --> 12:50.853
with a great writer

12:50.895 --> 12:53.064
and to get to meet him,

12:50.895 --> 12:53.064
hear him talk..

12:53.106 --> 12:54.315
Very, very lucky.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.234
- You think so?

12:54.357 --> 12:56.234
- Definitely!

12:56.276 --> 12:58.737
Well, maybe this time,

12:56.276 --> 12:58.737
it won't be so bad after all.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.116
So, you want to get something

13:01.281 --> 13:03.116
to drink or do you have to go?

13:03.157 --> 13:05.452
No, I don't have to go.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.452
I don't have anywhere to go.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.412
Okay. Be right back.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.422
- Hey, Lane.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.422
- Hi, Lorelai.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.507
- Hmm. You look different.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.507
- I do?

13:19.549 --> 13:21.008
Yeah, you look cute,

13:19.549 --> 13:21.008
I mean, you always look cute.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.052
But this is just a new facet

13:21.050 --> 13:23.052
of your cuteness.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.596
Thanks.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.596
You look cute, too.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.640
I have a boyfriend,

13:24.638 --> 13:26.640
so, maybe

13:26.681 --> 13:28.807
this flirting thing we've got

13:26.681 --> 13:28.807
going on should just end here.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.226
I think so, too.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.226
Coffee to go?

13:30.268 --> 13:31.436
It's that special time of day.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.147
- 'Ah!'

13:31.478 --> 13:34.147
- What was that?

13:34.188 --> 13:36.149
It's been like that for

13:34.188 --> 13:36.149
an hour. It's the damn oven.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.484
Damn oven!

13:37.525 --> 13:39.277
What's up

13:37.525 --> 13:39.277
with the damn oven?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.613
I bought this damn oven

13:39.319 --> 13:41.613
and the thermostat doesn't work.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.239
The damn thermostat

13:41.655 --> 13:43.239
or just the thermostat?

13:43.281 --> 13:44.949
- Are you being cute?

13:43.281 --> 13:44.949
- Sorry. Go on.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.701
So, I went out

13:44.991 --> 13:46.701
and got a new thermostat

13:46.743 --> 13:48.787
and now I can't figure out

13:46.743 --> 13:48.787
how to replace the damn thing.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.163
So, it is

13:48.827 --> 13:50.163
a damn thermostat.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.289
I don't have time

13:50.204 --> 13:51.289
for this.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.458
Come on.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.458
You can do this.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.209
A step at a time here.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.128
You pulled the knob off each

13:55.251 --> 13:57.128
gas tap on the range, right?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.755
'Uh, yeah. So?'

13:58.797 --> 14:00.923
Then, you removed the four

13:58.797 --> 14:00.923
screws securing the face panel.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.801
- Then remove the panel.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.801
- Yeah, I did that.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.719
Then you disconnected

14:02.841 --> 14:04.719
the oven gas-supply pipe

14:04.761 --> 14:06.346
from the outlet

14:04.761 --> 14:06.346
of the thermostat.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.306
'This is where I got stuck.'

14:08.348 --> 14:10.016
Did you release

14:08.348 --> 14:10.016
the oven sensor

14:10.057 --> 14:11.976
retaining clips

14:10.057 --> 14:11.976
from the oven lining?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.728
'No. No, I didn't.'

14:13.770 --> 14:15.938
- 'Okay. Got it!'

14:13.770 --> 14:15.938
- Now, just pull the sensor out.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.857
- You should be rolling now.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.857
- So, how? How?

14:18.899 --> 14:20.276
- How what?

14:18.899 --> 14:20.276
- How do you know this?

14:20.318 --> 14:21.611
Well, I couldn't get

14:20.318 --> 14:21.611
to sleep

14:21.653 --> 14:23.196
the other night

14:21.653 --> 14:23.196
when we went to bed.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.864
- So, I read your oven manual.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.864
- You're kidding.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.574
Well, it was either that

14:24.905 --> 14:26.574
or the broiler manual

14:26.616 --> 14:28.535
and the oven won.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.828
You never cease

14:28.576 --> 14:29.828
to amaze me.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.246
I never will.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.246
Bye, doll.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.998
And, hey, leave

14:32.288 --> 14:33.998
the broiler manual out for me.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.876
I'm kind of into this whole

14:34.040 --> 14:36.876
kitchen-appliance genre now.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.086
You know, kitch lit.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.086
Hey, there, Zach.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.464
Howdy.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.464
Hi, there.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.466
Well, aren't we bouncy?

14:43.508 --> 14:45.092
- I'm in a pretty good mood.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.092
- Why is that?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.220
I'm just feeling

14:45.134 --> 14:47.220
nice and light.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.680
What's up with your face?

14:48.722 --> 14:50.390
Oh, what do you think's up

14:48.722 --> 14:50.390
with my face?

14:50.431 --> 14:52.183
- It looks all nude.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.183
- For a good reason.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.518
You're not wearing your glasses.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.019
That's right.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.396
'But you're blind

14:55.061 --> 14:56.396
without your glasses.'

14:56.437 --> 14:58.022
- The wonder of contacts.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.022
- Contacts?

14:58.064 --> 14:59.357
- Contacts.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.357
- Why?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.901
Why? So I don't have

14:59.399 --> 15:01.901
to wear glasses.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.277
So, like, for all the time?

15:03.319 --> 15:06.406
Yeah...you okay?

15:06.447 --> 15:07.907
I guess, I mean that's

15:06.447 --> 15:07.907
a pretty big thing

15:07.948 --> 15:09.158
to just spring on a guy.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.660
- Why?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.660
- You don't look like you.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.161
Yes, I do.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.747
It's just me, my face,

15:12.203 --> 15:13.747
without being impeded

15:13.788 --> 15:15.331
by a foreign plastic object.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.083
But you're the first smart girl

15:15.373 --> 15:17.083
I've ever gone out with

15:17.124 --> 15:18.877
and the glasses

15:17.124 --> 15:18.877
are a big part of that.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.504
Well, my IQ is still the same.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.504
Contacts don't change that.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.214
But you loose that

15:21.546 --> 15:23.214
in initial impact.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.841
Now, people will have to talk

15:23.256 --> 15:24.841
to you for a few minutes

15:24.883 --> 15:26.175
to figure out that you're smart.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.677
Well, then, that's what

15:26.217 --> 15:27.677
they'll have to do.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.970
Okay, I'll try to get

15:27.719 --> 15:29.970
used to it.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.806
Yeah, and you will.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.517
I'm sorry. Am I supposed to eat

15:31.848 --> 15:34.517
my soup without a spoon?

15:34.559 --> 15:37.061
Of course, she doesn't think

15:34.559 --> 15:37.061
that, okay. She's really smart.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.979
She's just not wearing

15:37.103 --> 15:38.979
her glasses.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.401
(male #1)

15:41.858 --> 15:43.401
'You should have

15:41.858 --> 15:43.401
heard him, Richard.'

15:43.443 --> 15:45.361
- Oh, I can imagine.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.361
- I had him on speakerphone.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.614
When Lori heard the screaming,

15:45.403 --> 15:47.614
she ran in holding her shoe.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.198
She thought,

15:47.655 --> 15:49.198
I was being attacked.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.242
Ha, ha. Oh, you're

15:49.240 --> 15:51.242
in good hands with that Lori.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.703
I wish I had a secretary who

15:51.284 --> 15:53.703
would defend me with her shoe.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.663
Now, he may be mad now,

15:53.745 --> 15:55.663
but wait till we go to court.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.874
- Well, maybe he'll settle.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.874
- Oh, he'll never settle.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.460
Oh, he will if we send

15:57.916 --> 16:00.460
Lori in with her shoe.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.336
He's already got his lawyers

16:00.501 --> 16:02.336
working on this.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.131
Well, we're gonna have

16:02.378 --> 16:05.131
to bring in outside counsel.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.925
- It's gonna get a little messy.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.925
- Who's available?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.719
- How about Maurice Newsome?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.719
- No, he over colognes.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.011
Brier?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.388
No, Brier's onto

16:11.053 --> 16:12.388
the Feeney case.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.974
- Oh, yeah.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.974
- What about Simon Mclean?

16:15.015 --> 16:17.393
Uh, I don't think you really

16:15.015 --> 16:17.393
want Simon on this one, Richard.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.062
Why not? He's always done

16:17.435 --> 16:20.062
a top-notch job for us before.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.689
He's aggressive.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.689
He's not sloppy.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.149
'He's very creative.'

16:23.190 --> 16:24.525
- Yes, but, Richard..

16:23.190 --> 16:24.525
- What?

16:24.567 --> 16:25.819
Well, we just assumed

16:24.567 --> 16:25.819
you wouldn't wanna work

16:25.860 --> 16:27.403
that closely with Simon

16:25.860 --> 16:27.403
anymore, you know.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.530
Since the whole thing

16:27.445 --> 16:29.530
with him and Emily.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.283
Ah.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.284
Yes.

16:34.452 --> 16:37.413
Well...what about Brandt?

16:37.455 --> 16:38.539
- 'Brandt.'

16:38.581 --> 16:39.791
- 'Mm-hmm.'

16:38.581 --> 16:39.791
- 'Very good.'

16:39.833 --> 16:41.542
- 'Terrific.'

16:39.833 --> 16:41.542
- 'Brandt it is.'

16:41.584 --> 16:44.545
Well, apparently the padlock

16:41.584 --> 16:44.545
discussion was a big dud.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.130
I just got a call

16:44.587 --> 16:46.130
from Mrs. Berg.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.007
Cletus is standing

16:46.172 --> 16:48.007
in her wading pool.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.968
- I need carrots.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.968
- Bottom shelf.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.219
Oh, I love it when I talk

16:50.009 --> 16:52.219
and no one listens.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.596
- Makes me think of home.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.596
- Okay.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.890
I just took

16:53.638 --> 16:55.890
the Andersons to room three.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.976
I opened the door,

16:55.932 --> 16:57.976
and when I went inside

16:58.017 --> 16:59.811
I found that the bedspread

16:58.017 --> 16:59.811
was mussed.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.688
- The bedspread was mussed.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.688
- Call a cop.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.397
I checked that room

17:01.729 --> 17:03.397
personally last night.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.650
After it had been cleaned.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.650
It was perfect.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.151
- No muss.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.151
- No fuss.

17:07.193 --> 17:10.112
Why are you joking? Why?

17:10.154 --> 17:12.699
Do you not care that somebody's

17:10.154 --> 17:12.699
sneaking into our rooms

17:12.740 --> 17:14.450
mussing the beds,

17:12.740 --> 17:14.450
eating the food?

17:14.492 --> 17:16.452
- Okay, I'm sorry. You're right.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.452
- I know, I'm right.

17:16.494 --> 17:17.954
I do not need you

17:16.494 --> 17:17.954
to tell me I'm right.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.873
Okay, so, what do we think

17:17.996 --> 17:19.873
is going on here?

17:19.914 --> 17:22.416
I believe that employees are

17:19.914 --> 17:22.416
clandestinely using our rooms

17:22.458 --> 17:24.251
for sexual encounters

17:22.458 --> 17:24.251
on their coffee breaks.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.879
- Come on.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.879
- Lars and Celia.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.338
Seem awfully friendly lately.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.008
You don't notice them

17:27.380 --> 17:30.008
making goo-goo eyes?

17:30.049 --> 17:32.468
And Celia has put on weight,

17:30.049 --> 17:32.468
perhaps one too many Toblerones.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.762
I don't think Lars and Celia

17:32.510 --> 17:34.762
are having an affair.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.389
- Hey, maybe we've got a ghost.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.389
- A ghost.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.516
That would be cool.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.516
People love haunted inns.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.934
'I wonder what kind of

17:38.558 --> 17:39.934
ghost we have.'

17:39.976 --> 17:41.268
Maybe a confederate soldier.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.937
Or a lonely spinster

17:41.310 --> 17:42.937
that never married.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.063
Or Patrick Swayze.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.690
Oh, In search of

17:44.104 --> 17:45.690
his lost career.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.275
Maybe we have ghosts having sex

17:45.732 --> 17:48.275
and then eating Toblerone.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.861
Ooh, hungry,

17:48.317 --> 17:49.861
horny ghosts.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.196
I am done with both of you.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.698
[giggles]

17:53.740 --> 17:56.325
I guess I should go up

17:53.740 --> 17:56.325
to room 3 and see what..

17:56.367 --> 17:58.160
Kirk, what are

17:56.367 --> 17:58.160
you doing here?

17:58.202 --> 17:59.829
I'm assembling

17:58.202 --> 17:59.829
the bouquet garnish.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.915
- I thought you hired him.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.915
- I did not hire him.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.042
I thought I might wanna work

18:01.956 --> 18:04.042
on a kitchen staff someday.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.752
And I figured this was

18:04.083 --> 18:05.752
a good place to learn.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.336
Kirk, get out.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.546
Can I at least finish my shift?

18:08.588 --> 18:09.589
No.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.840
[cell phone rings]

18:14.719 --> 18:15.803
Hello.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.221
- Hey, what's up?

18:15.845 --> 18:17.221
- 'We have ghosts.'

18:17.263 --> 18:19.432
Well, it's better than rats.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.432
Listen, I need a favor.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.059
- From me?

18:19.473 --> 18:21.059
- 'Yes, from you.'

18:21.100 --> 18:22.727
Oh, well, let me

18:21.100 --> 18:22.727
get out my list.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.062
Okay, I'll write this

18:22.769 --> 18:24.062
favor down right under

18:24.103 --> 18:25.521
the one that says,

18:24.103 --> 18:25.521
"Gave me life."

18:25.563 --> 18:28.066
Look, I may have a thing Friday,

18:25.563 --> 18:28.066
which would mean

18:28.107 --> 18:29.442
that I would need to get out

18:28.107 --> 18:29.442
of Friday night dinner.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.902
A thing?

18:30.944 --> 18:32.194
I was wondering

18:30.944 --> 18:32.194
if you could cover for me.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.696
What kind of

18:32.236 --> 18:33.696
a thing? A man thing?

18:33.738 --> 18:35.448
Possibly a man thing.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.450
- Okay, spill. Who is he?

18:35.489 --> 18:37.450
- I don't wanna jinx it, okay?

18:37.491 --> 18:39.035
It's not a definite,

18:37.491 --> 18:39.035
when I know it's a go

18:39.077 --> 18:40.745
I promise I'll fill

18:39.077 --> 18:40.745
you in completely.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.456
I can't believe you're going to

18:40.787 --> 18:43.456
leave me alone with my parents

18:43.497 --> 18:45.041
just so you can have

18:43.497 --> 18:45.041
a social life.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.667
What happened

18:45.083 --> 18:46.667
to the good old days

18:46.709 --> 18:48.878
of the spinster daughter

18:46.709 --> 18:48.878
taking care of the parents

18:48.920 --> 18:51.171
'and living a lonely,

18:48.920 --> 18:51.171
sexless existence?'

18:51.213 --> 18:52.465
- So, you'll cover for me?

18:51.213 --> 18:52.465
- Yeah.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.507
'Thank you,

18:52.506 --> 18:53.507
I'll call you later.'

18:53.549 --> 18:54.550
Bye, honey.

18:54.592 --> 18:55.802
Hey, I just asked Lars

18:55.843 --> 18:57.553
if he was seeing anyone special.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.346
He misunderstood,

18:57.595 --> 18:59.346
and he might be filing

18:59.388 --> 19:01.348
one of those sexual-harassment

18:59.388 --> 19:01.348
charges against me.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.391
- What?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.391
- And you.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.684
'Cause I said

19:02.433 --> 19:03.684
you made me.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.186
Hey, hey, Michel!

19:03.726 --> 19:06.186
Come back here!

19:06.228 --> 19:07.814
I'll get him!

19:07.855 --> 19:11.859
Okay, guys, let's try it again,

19:07.855 --> 19:11.859
and let's try not to suck.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.694
We'll get it.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.694
We just have to focus.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.404
By the way your e string's

19:13.736 --> 19:15.404
a little flat.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.865
Which by the way, makes it

19:15.446 --> 19:17.865
a little bit more rock 'n' roll.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.742
- Okay, are we ready?

19:17.907 --> 19:19.742
- Count it down.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.702
<i>Eine, zwei, drei, vier.</i>

Hey, could you not do

19:21.744 --> 19:23.913
the countdown in German?

19:23.955 --> 19:24.956
It's depressing.

You couldn't even hear me

19:51.024 --> 19:53.026
over that noise.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.987
That noise is my passion, mama,

19:53.067 --> 19:55.987
and you're keeping me from it.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.322
- E string was flat too.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.322
- What can we do for you?

19:58.364 --> 20:00.324
This year, I am hosting

19:58.364 --> 20:00.324
Lunar New Year dinner.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.701
- You are to come.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.701
- Why?

20:01.742 --> 20:03.703
You are my daughter.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.703
Not coming is humiliation.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.204
Have we forgotten the incident

20:03.744 --> 20:05.204
at the newsstand?

20:05.245 --> 20:06.664
The what?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.124
You yelled at my boyfriend

20:06.706 --> 20:08.124
in public, mama.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.583
What's that if it's

20:08.166 --> 20:09.583
not humiliation?

20:09.625 --> 20:11.169
- That is in the past.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.169
- Not for me.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.920
- You must come to this.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.920
- Oh, yeah?

20:12.962 --> 20:15.339
Well, only if I can

20:12.962 --> 20:15.339
bring my boyfriend.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.091
- What?

20:15.381 --> 20:17.091
- It's both or neither of us.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.425
Take it or leave it.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.011
I have only enough chairs

20:18.467 --> 20:20.011

You sell chairs, mama.

You have 800 chairs.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.057
Fine. Bring boy.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.225
But if boy comes, I invite

20:24.098 --> 20:26.225

- I hate the Parks.

- You shouldn't hate the Parks.

You hate the Parks.

- Fine.

- Yes.

- Bring them all.

How do you know that?

21:08.392 --> 21:10.644
I've done a little internet

21:08.392 --> 21:10.644
research on Korean New Year.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.730
Surf the net, there's a lot

21:10.686 --> 21:12.730
of information there.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.107
There's also

21:12.772 --> 21:14.107
a lot of pictures

21:14.148 --> 21:16.943
of girls with tattoos

21:14.148 --> 21:16.943
on motorcycles.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.278
You would think it gets old,

21:16.984 --> 21:19.278
but it doesn't.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.696
Sorry about this.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.364
I feel like I'm going

21:20.738 --> 21:22.364
to the dentist.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.532
That's not an unusual

21:22.406 --> 21:23.532
thing to feel

21:23.574 --> 21:25.118
when approaching

21:23.574 --> 21:25.118
the Kim house.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.786
I just hope I don't throw up

21:25.159 --> 21:26.786
in the<i> bok jo ri.</i>

21:26.827 --> 21:28.162
I got your back, okay?

21:26.827 --> 21:28.162
You're not alone.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.372
Are you sure they're home?

21:28.204 --> 21:30.372
There's not a sound.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.583
I'm sure.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.583
Go ahead and knock.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.418
Uh, Gil,

21:32.625 --> 21:34.418
the "AC/DC" ring.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.296
Right. Sorry.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.672
- Hello..

21:37.337 --> 21:38.672
- Hello, mama.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.258
I said we'd come,

21:38.714 --> 21:40.258
and we've come.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.301
- I'm Gil.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.301
- Yes.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.428
And, mama,

21:42.342 --> 21:44.428
you know Brian.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.305
<i>Say hay boke-mahn he</i>

21:44.470 --> 21:46.305
<i>pah du say oh.</i>

21:46.346 --> 21:47.681
He likes the internet.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.058
Who's this half-boy

21:47.723 --> 21:49.058
hiding behind you?

21:49.100 --> 21:51.936
That's Zach, mama.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.936
You've met him too.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.312
Happy New Year,

21:51.978 --> 21:53.312
I guess.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.355
Yes. Come in.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.651
[instrumental music]

22:04.448 --> 22:06.826
Well, looky here.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.826
The fleet's in town.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.453
Yep. We're having a little

22:06.867 --> 22:09.453
Davey, Daddy night tonight.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.580
- Aw.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.580
- Just the men being manly.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.207
- Wanna punch me in the stomach?

22:11.622 --> 22:13.207
- I'll pass on the punch.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.917
Listen, I wonder

22:13.249 --> 22:14.917
if you could do me a favor.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.418
I don't wanna pull

22:14.959 --> 22:16.418
your finger either.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.504
I know now's an important time

22:16.460 --> 22:18.504
for you guys.

22:18.545 --> 22:19.922
The inn's just getting off

22:18.545 --> 22:19.922
the ground

22:19.964 --> 22:21.674
and there's a lot

22:19.964 --> 22:21.674
of extra work.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.468
But if you could just encourage

22:21.715 --> 22:24.468
Sookie to ease up a little?

22:24.510 --> 22:26.262
- Delegate.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.262
- Sookie, delegate?

22:26.304 --> 22:28.555
I know, but with

22:26.304 --> 22:28.555
the pregnancy and all?

22:28.597 --> 22:30.516
And I know her hours

22:28.597 --> 22:30.516
are generally pretty good.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.268
Most nights

22:30.557 --> 22:32.268
she's home by seven.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.061
It's just these new late nights

22:32.310 --> 22:34.061
that worry me.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.314
- Late nights?

22:34.103 --> 22:36.314
- I mean not worry me, worry me.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.564
I just don't want her

22:36.354 --> 22:37.564
to overdo it.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.317
Oh, sure, sure.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.194
But, um, Jackson, I think

22:39.357 --> 22:41.194
Sookie left before me tonight.

22:41.235 --> 22:42.569
Oh, no. She called.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.362
She said the new kitchen

22:42.611 --> 22:44.362
help's a little slow.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.532
Whatever, I know

22:44.404 --> 22:46.532
she has to do it.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.993
It's just every week now.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.993
It's no big deal.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.536
Just see if you can

22:49.035 --> 22:50.536
say something.

22:50.577 --> 22:51.912
Um, okay.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.289
- I'll see what I can do.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.289
- Thank you.

22:53.331 --> 22:55.499
Okay, son, I think it's time

22:53.331 --> 22:55.499
to get you laid.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.501
Oh, that's sweet.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.501
Bye, boys.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.502
Bye.

23:04.258 --> 23:07.136
Gretchen, I can still smell

23:04.258 --> 23:07.136
the fish from here.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.767
Well, funny running

23:11.431 --> 23:13.767
into you here.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.811
- You look very nice.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.811
- Thank you.

23:15.853 --> 23:16.979
Do you have the directions?

23:17.021 --> 23:18.272
I have an extra copy

23:17.021 --> 23:18.272
if you need it.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.440
I'm fine.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.440
Thank you.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.735
Alright. I guess

23:20.482 --> 23:22.735
I'll see you there.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.778
Seems inevitable,

23:22.776 --> 23:24.778
doesn't it?

23:42.338 --> 23:44.173
Good eats, slimy.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.674
I'm enjoying it.

23:45.716 --> 23:47.801
I like slimy food

23:45.716 --> 23:47.801
'cause it slides down easy

23:47.843 --> 23:50.221
and I get the sense

23:47.843 --> 23:50.221
it keeps sliding, right?

23:50.263 --> 23:53.266
Which helps your colon and stuff

23:50.263 --> 23:53.266
'cause it scrapes as it slides

23:53.307 --> 23:56.143
and since it's not in you long,

23:53.307 --> 23:56.143
you don't get fat, you know?

23:56.185 --> 23:58.520
- Just eat.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.520
- You're not hungry?

23:58.562 --> 24:01.107
Slimy food doesn't float my boat

23:58.562 --> 24:01.107
like it does others.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.111
I'll be right back.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.111
I have to go to the bathroom.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.653
You're not allowed

24:05.152 --> 24:06.653
to leave the table.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.696
Nature's calling, kid.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.282
Nature must wait!

24:12.285 --> 24:14.120
How's about keeping it down,

24:12.285 --> 24:14.120
there, scooter?

24:14.161 --> 24:15.746
Sit till we're done!

24:21.710 --> 24:24.255
If I beat the crap out of this

24:21.710 --> 24:24.255
little kid, will anyone care?

24:24.297 --> 24:26.590
Mama locks the bathroom door

24:24.297 --> 24:26.590
while we eat anyway.

24:26.632 --> 24:27.591
Super.

24:28.508 --> 24:29.969
We are done eating.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.469
There will be a 30 minute

24:30.010 --> 24:31.469
break till dessert

24:31.511 --> 24:33.347
while Mrs. Shin

24:31.511 --> 24:33.347
and her fellow musicians

24:33.389 --> 24:34.974
play for you

24:33.389 --> 24:34.974
in the other room.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.351
Mrs. Shin,

24:35.015 --> 24:37.351
better start setting up.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.686
Look at the funky guitar.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.686
Awesome!

24:39.728 --> 24:41.772
It's a<i> gayangeum, </i>

24:39.728 --> 24:41.772
and if I'm not mistaken

24:41.814 --> 24:44.524
I believe I spotted a<i> danso</i>

24:41.814 --> 24:44.524
and a<i> junggeum</i> on the way in.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.734
I gotta check this out.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.655
Can I get up?

24:49.696 --> 24:50.656
Yes!

24:52.699 --> 24:54.368
Yeah, he can get up?

24:54.410 --> 24:56.536
You have a much knowledge

24:54.410 --> 24:56.536
of Korean culture.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.291
- Thanks.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.291
- That was forward of me.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.917
I should retire

25:00.333 --> 25:01.917
to my room and sleep.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.836
No. Don't do that.

25:03.877 --> 25:04.962
It's okay.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.516
Oh, I can't believe you've

25:16.432 --> 25:18.516
never seen "The Office."

25:18.558 --> 25:20.311
- I feel very stupid.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.311
- Well, you should.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.396
It's brilliant, especially

25:20.353 --> 25:22.396
the fourth time you see it.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.981
What happens the fourth time

25:22.438 --> 25:23.981
you see it?

25:24.023 --> 25:26.484
You can actually understand

25:24.023 --> 25:26.484
what they're saying.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.526
I have them all on DVD.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.526
You can borrow them if you want.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.821
But only if you promise to abide

25:28.568 --> 25:30.821
by the fourth time rule.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.490
I'll abide

25:30.863 --> 25:32.490
by your fourth time rule.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.283
If it's as good as you say,

25:32.530 --> 25:34.283
I'll raise you a fifth.

25:34.325 --> 25:35.533
- Deal.

25:34.325 --> 25:35.533
- Oh, here.

25:35.575 --> 25:36.910
I almost forgot your notes.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.621
- Oh, I hope they helped.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.621
- They did.

25:39.663 --> 25:40.706
Some guy tried

25:39.663 --> 25:40.706
to mug me earlier

25:40.747 --> 25:41.748
and I beat him

25:40.747 --> 25:41.748
to death.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.167
Hey, I like my research.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.710
I like your research, too.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.710
And thank you.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.544
It helped?

25:46.586 --> 25:48.506
The story's done, Doyle's safe,

25:46.586 --> 25:48.506
all's right with the world.

25:48.546 --> 25:49.715
You're welcome.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.218
So..

25:53.344 --> 25:54.887
So..

25:54.928 --> 25:57.723
- It's been fun.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.723
- Yeah, it has been.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.142
Okay, so, I should get going.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.142
I'm heading to New York.

26:00.184 --> 26:02.560
Right, for your dad's party.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.561
Yep.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.232
So..

26:07.983 --> 26:09.527
...have a good weekend.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.696
Oh, yeah. You, too.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.696
Have a good weekend.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.031
And hey, don't be a stranger.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.201
Mm-hmm.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.334
[sighs]

26:24.291 --> 26:25.334
Hey, Kirk.

26:25.376 --> 26:26.419
- No messages.

26:25.376 --> 26:26.419
- Super.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.716

[key rattles in lock]

26:40.974 --> 26:43.477
Mm, behold our ghost.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.062
Okay, this isn't

26:43.519 --> 26:45.062
what it looks like.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.480
I don't know

26:45.104 --> 26:46.480
what it looks like.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.315
I'm just watching TV.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.401
Because we have the convenient

26:48.357 --> 26:50.401
channel list next to the bed?

26:50.443 --> 26:52.486
'No, though it is convenient.'

26:52.528 --> 26:54.905
So, you want to tell me

26:52.528 --> 26:54.905
what's going on?

26:54.947 --> 26:57.657
You know, before Kirk changes

26:54.947 --> 26:57.657
into his maid's outfit

26:57.699 --> 26:58.992
and starts to clean the room?

26:59.034 --> 27:00.869
A few weeks ago,

26:59.034 --> 27:00.869
I read in the paper

27:00.911 --> 27:02.620
that there was gonna be an

27:00.911 --> 27:02.620
episode of "Dark Shadows" on

27:02.662 --> 27:04.957
the one where Barnabas is

27:02.662 --> 27:04.957
released from his tomb.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.792
'And I used to love

27:04.998 --> 27:06.792
"Dark shadows."'

27:06.833 --> 27:08.502
'And I just suddenly really

27:06.833 --> 27:08.502
wanted to see it.'

27:08.544 --> 27:09.545
Sure.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.088
So I didn't get off work in time

27:11.130 --> 27:12.381
to get home and see it.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.091
So I came up here

27:12.423 --> 27:14.091
and it was just supposed

27:14.133 --> 27:16.343
to be that one time,

27:14.133 --> 27:16.343
but the room was really nice

27:16.385 --> 27:18.220
and I was really comfortable.

27:18.262 --> 27:21.599
And there were Toblerones,

27:18.262 --> 27:21.599
and I just had the best time.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.641
It was an hour all to myself,

27:21.639 --> 27:23.641
and the next week

27:23.683 --> 27:25.643
it was another good episode

27:23.683 --> 27:25.643
and I just kind of..

27:25.685 --> 27:27.313
Decided to haunt the place.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.898
I tried to clean up afterwards,

27:27.354 --> 27:29.898
and the bed was not mussed.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.734
Michel is too anal

27:29.940 --> 27:32.734
for his own good.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.652
- I'm horrible.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.652
- You're not horrible.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.323
I am, I'm the most horrible

27:34.694 --> 27:37.323
person in the world.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.450
Well, my mother will be sad

27:37.364 --> 27:39.450
to know she's been dethroned.

27:39.492 --> 27:43.120
I'm lying to my husband.

27:39.492 --> 27:43.120
I'm eating the inn's candy.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.746
You can't discuss

27:43.162 --> 27:44.746
this with Jackson?

27:44.788 --> 27:46.748
Tell him you need one night

27:44.788 --> 27:46.748
a week to yourself?

27:46.790 --> 27:48.459
To watch "Dark Shadows".

27:46.790 --> 27:48.459
He wouldn't understand that?

27:48.501 --> 27:51.086
Of course he would understand.

27:48.501 --> 27:51.086
That's the problem.

27:51.128 --> 27:52.588
Jackson would

27:51.128 --> 27:52.588
immediately tell me

27:52.630 --> 27:54.423
"Sit down, relax.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.423
Watch TV."

27:54.465 --> 27:56.842
- And he'll take care of Davey.

27:54.465 --> 27:56.842
- Uh, men are pigs.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.552
And then I would sit there

27:56.883 --> 27:58.552
racked with guilt

27:58.594 --> 28:00.929
because he works all day too,

27:58.594 --> 28:00.929
and I would think about

28:00.971 --> 28:02.889
the fact that I'm shirking

28:00.971 --> 28:02.889
my motherly duties.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.351
'And it would ruin

28:02.931 --> 28:05.351
everything, but here..'

28:05.392 --> 28:07.019
I get it.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.229
- I'm sorry, I didn't tell you.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.229
- Uh, don't worry about it.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.772
I do think you

28:09.271 --> 28:10.772
should tell Jackson though.

28:10.814 --> 28:11.982
He thinks I have you

28:10.814 --> 28:11.982
chained to the stove.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.651
He's worried

28:12.024 --> 28:13.651
you're working too hard.

28:13.691 --> 28:15.194
I know, I'll go home

28:13.691 --> 28:15.194
right now and tell him.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.112
Okay.

28:17.154 --> 28:20.032
Of course, this is the episode

28:17.154 --> 28:20.032
where Barnabas kidnaps Maggie.

28:20.073 --> 28:23.160
And imprisons her in a coffin

28:20.073 --> 28:23.160
in the mausoleum's secret room

28:23.202 --> 28:24.662
in punishment

28:23.202 --> 28:24.662
for disobeying him?

28:24.702 --> 28:25.996
- Yeah.

28:24.702 --> 28:25.996
- Scoot over.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.207
[gasps]

28:26.038 --> 28:28.207
Really?

28:28.248 --> 28:30.376
[giggles]

28:28.248 --> 28:30.376
Cool.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.751
- Toblerone?

28:30.417 --> 28:31.751
- Mm-hmm.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.172
These rooms are nice.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.382
[giggles]

28:43.180 --> 28:44.764
Excuse me.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.764
I need a ticket.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.600
Emily.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.520
Simon. Well, this is

28:46.642 --> 28:49.520
a pleasant surprise.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.104
- Are you waiting for someone?

28:49.562 --> 28:51.104
- Yes.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.607
A mysterious man with

28:51.146 --> 28:53.607
an exotic accent and a red coat

28:53.649 --> 28:55.067
to give me a ticket

28:53.649 --> 28:55.067
for my car.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.527
Ah, well, I wish you

28:55.108 --> 28:56.527
a great deal of luck.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.237
So, who are you here with?

28:58.278 --> 29:00.573
My daughter and her husband.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.573
They're right over there.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.533
I'd love for you to meet them.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.533
Diana, come here for a second.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.993
[tires screech]

29:05.035 --> 29:06.412
What on earth?

29:08.830 --> 29:10.165
Emily.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.042
Richard, have you

29:10.207 --> 29:12.042
lost your mind?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.544
I misjudged the distance.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.713
You misjudged the distance?

29:13.586 --> 29:15.713
You hit my car!

29:15.754 --> 29:17.548
- I was distracted.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.548
- Emily, are you okay?

29:17.590 --> 29:20.175
I'm her husband, Simon.

29:17.590 --> 29:20.175
I'll ask her if she's okay.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.760
- Are you okay?

29:20.217 --> 29:21.760
- I'm fine.

29:21.801 --> 29:24.930
She's fine, Simon.

29:21.801 --> 29:24.930
Are you happy? Now go away.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.682
Emily, maybe you

29:24.971 --> 29:26.682
should see a doctor.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.517
We'll determine whether

29:26.724 --> 29:28.517
she needs to see a doctor.

29:28.559 --> 29:29.809
This is a family matter.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.645
I'll call you tomorrow

29:29.851 --> 29:31.645
and see how you are.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.398
She'll be fine, Simon.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.398
She doesn't need your call.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.483
Do you hear me, Simon?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.483
Don't call.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.485
Were you bitten

29:36.525 --> 29:38.485
by some sort of rabid animal?

29:38.527 --> 29:42.281
Let's go. You, you.

29:38.527 --> 29:42.281
I'm taking her home.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.032
- I'll come back for this car.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.032
- You'll what?

29:44.074 --> 29:46.285
You were just in

29:44.074 --> 29:46.285
a car accident, Emily.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.495
You can't go to a party after

29:46.326 --> 29:48.495
having been in an accident.

29:48.537 --> 29:51.039
- Let's go.

29:48.537 --> 29:51.039
- What are you doing?

29:56.378 --> 29:58.046
Maybe we should

29:56.378 --> 29:58.046
take you to the hospital.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.214
I think it's a toss-up

29:58.088 --> 29:59.214
who needs a trip

29:59.256 --> 30:01.007
to the hospital more.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.135
When you pull up to a valet

30:01.049 --> 30:03.135
stand, you get out of the car.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.637
You don't dawdle.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.764
I was waiting for someone

30:04.678 --> 30:06.764
to take my car.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.308
Well, you wait outside the car.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.308
Everybody knows that.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.851
It is not my fault

30:09.349 --> 30:11.851
that you ran into my car.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.729
- I know you dated him.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.729
- What?

30:13.771 --> 30:16.565
Simon Mclean, I know

30:13.771 --> 30:16.565
you dated Simon Mclean.

30:16.607 --> 30:18.484
Richard, I was just

30:16.607 --> 30:18.484
in an accident.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.319
Now is hardly the time

30:18.525 --> 30:20.319
to discuss this.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.779
Fine.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.530
I found out about it

30:21.820 --> 30:23.530
in a business meeting

30:23.572 --> 30:26.992
'which was hardly the time

30:23.572 --> 30:26.992
to find out about it, but fine.'

30:27.033 --> 30:29.202
- It was dinner.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.202
- Dinner, of course, dinner.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.455
- Nothing happened.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.455
- Of course, nothing happened.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.457
Stop it, Richard. I wouldn't

30:31.497 --> 30:33.457
say it if it wasn't true.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.250
Well, I told you

30:33.499 --> 30:35.250
that nothing happened

30:35.292 --> 30:38.044
between me and Pennilyn Lott,

30:35.292 --> 30:38.044
that all we did was have lunch.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.921
And I wouldn't have said

30:38.086 --> 30:39.921
that if that weren't true.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.132
Well, then there's nothing more

30:39.963 --> 30:42.132
to be said about these things.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.342
I agree.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.512
People are staring, Richard.

30:46.553 --> 30:47.805
We're going.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.959
I'm counting the seconds.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.044
- Lane.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.044
- Yes, mama?

31:19.085 --> 31:20.086
I need your help

31:19.085 --> 31:20.086
in the kitchen.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.254

31:24.633 --> 31:25.634

Come.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.013
Lane, come now.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.849

31:39.064 --> 31:40.733
And by the way

31:39.064 --> 31:40.733
I didn't hear you ask.

31:40.774 --> 31:42.108
- I heard you demand.

31:40.774 --> 31:42.108
- Lane..

31:42.150 --> 31:44.361
Because you don't offer,

31:42.150 --> 31:44.361
as I taught you to.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.279
- Here we go.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.279
- Such insolence.

- Lane..

31:46.321 --> 31:47.698
- You don't get it, mama.

She should wear them,

32:18.729 --> 32:20.564
she should always wear them.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.066
I've said it before, but it's

32:20.606 --> 32:23.066
true, they made you look smart.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.527
Of course, I made her look

32:23.108 --> 32:25.527
smart. She's a smart girl.

- Totally.

- Zach.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.073
She always look good in them.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.073
Glasses suit her face.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.200
The black frames,

32:30.115 --> 32:32.200
especially, with her hair.

32:32.242 --> 32:34.077
She wore them

32:32.242 --> 32:34.077
in the first grade.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.955
- She first girl in her class.

- And I bet she looked great.

32:36.996 --> 32:39.082
I have pictures in a photo book.

32:36.996 --> 32:39.082
I could show you.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.876
- I'd love to see them.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.876
- Wait, Zach.

Come. We chisel pots later.

you're feeling alright?

33:19.832 --> 33:21.166
I'm fine.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.465
I don't wanna go back

33:25.921 --> 33:28.465
to the pool house.

33:30.634 --> 33:31.885
Come home.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.481
- Hey.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.316
- What are you doing here?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.316
- Friday night dinner?

33:46.358 --> 33:47.943
- Is it not Friday night dinner?

33:46.358 --> 33:47.943
- No. I mean, yes.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.319
But I thought

33:47.985 --> 33:49.319
you had a thing.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.863
Oh, well, it wasn't

33:49.361 --> 33:50.863
a for sure thing.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.948
- You made it sound for sure.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.948
- It was a maybe thing.

33:52.990 --> 33:54.491
And now it's nothing.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.617
- Oh, you look disappointed.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.617
- I don't wanna talk about it.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.160
- Do you wanna talk about it?

33:55.659 --> 33:57.160
- No.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.954
Okay, not even to tell me

33:57.202 --> 33:58.954
who the guy is?

33:58.996 --> 34:00.747
He's no one. Forget it.

34:00.789 --> 34:04.334
Okay, well, the mystery of

34:00.789 --> 34:04.334
the Gilmore dinners continues.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.669
- Meaning?

34:04.376 --> 34:05.669
- The pool house is empty.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.379
Grandpa forgot

34:05.711 --> 34:07.379
about us again?

34:07.420 --> 34:09.381
Yes, apparently all

34:07.420 --> 34:09.381
the complexes incurred

34:09.422 --> 34:11.508
in my childhood were not enough,

34:09.422 --> 34:11.508
they need to keep it coming.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.219
- Did you check on grandma yet?

34:11.550 --> 34:14.219
- I'm on my way there now.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.929
- Is it Marty?

34:14.260 --> 34:15.929
- Uh, forget it, mom.

34:15.971 --> 34:17.597
- Okay. But is it?

34:15.971 --> 34:17.597
- No.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.432
- Oops. Oh.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.432
- What are they doing together?

34:19.474 --> 34:21.184
- 'Are they arguing?'

34:19.474 --> 34:21.184
- 'No.'

34:21.226 --> 34:23.144
(Rory)

34:21.226 --> 34:23.144
'Well, I don't know,

34:21.226 --> 34:23.144
they don't look mad.'

34:23.186 --> 34:24.855
(Lorelai)

34:23.186 --> 34:24.855
'Uh, great, I'm so not

34:23.186 --> 34:24.855
in referee mode tonight.'

34:24.897 --> 34:26.105
Grandma just laughed.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.524
Eh, it could have been

34:26.147 --> 34:27.524
an evil laugh.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.026
Or a "I'm laughing at

34:27.566 --> 34:29.026
your pain" kind of laugh.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.694
Looked like a plain

34:29.067 --> 34:30.694
old laugh to me.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.487
(Lorelai)

34:30.736 --> 34:32.487
'Oh, dad's picking up

34:30.736 --> 34:32.487
an ashtray.'

34:32.529 --> 34:34.239
He's gonna throw it

34:32.529 --> 34:34.239
at her, finally.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.115
No, no, he's

34:34.280 --> 34:36.115
just moving it.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.576
I don't get it.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.576
What is going on?

34:37.617 --> 34:39.703
- What are they doing?

34:37.617 --> 34:39.703
- 'I don't...holy.'

34:39.745 --> 34:43.040
Oh, my God. My parents

34:39.745 --> 34:43.040
are having an affair.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.541
- Careful, it might be a trap.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.541
- What?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.251
I don't know.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.251
I'm freaking out.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.878
Does not compute.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.421
Girls, wonderful to see you.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.673
Come in, come in, come in.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.174
Hi, you're just in time.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.676
For what?

34:54.718 --> 34:57.387
A celebration.

34:54.718 --> 34:57.387
Ah, champagne perfect.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.638
What are we celebrating?

34:58.680 --> 35:00.223
Well, shall we tell them?

35:00.265 --> 35:01.850
They're going to find out

35:00.265 --> 35:01.850
sooner or later.

35:01.892 --> 35:04.227
Hm. Alright, then.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.104
Lorelai, Rory..

35:06.145 --> 35:08.857
Your grandmother

35:06.145 --> 35:08.857
and I have reconciled.

35:08.899 --> 35:10.525
'We are officially

35:08.899 --> 35:10.525
back together.'

35:10.567 --> 35:13.028
Really? Oh, my God.

35:13.070 --> 35:15.488
That's great.

35:13.070 --> 35:15.488
I'm so happy.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.074
When did this

35:15.530 --> 35:17.074
reconciliation happen?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.076
- Yesterday.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.076
- And last night.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.953
- And this morning.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.953
- Richard.

35:20.994 --> 35:22.829
Don't ask questions. Don't ask

35:20.994 --> 35:22.829
questions. Don't ask questions.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.122
And next week your father

35:24.163 --> 35:25.749
and I are going to

35:24.163 --> 35:25.749
renew our wedding vows.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.960
A week from tomorrow.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.960
On our 40th wedding anniversary.

35:28.001 --> 35:30.128
- Oh.

35:28.001 --> 35:30.128
- Wow, that's great.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.630
And you're going to be

35:30.169 --> 35:31.630
my maid of honor.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.840
- Uh, what?

35:31.671 --> 35:33.840
- Excuse me, Mr. Gilmore.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.259
Mr. Jeffries from

35:33.882 --> 35:36.259
the Windsor club for you.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.720
Ah, yes.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.720
Thank you, Robert.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.806
By the way, I'm firing

35:38.762 --> 35:40.806
Robert next week.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.808
- You won't need him.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.808
- No, I won't.

35:42.849 --> 35:46.227
Richard Gilmore here.

35:42.849 --> 35:46.227
The Gold Room?

35:46.269 --> 35:49.272
Uh, yeah, will you hold on

35:46.269 --> 35:49.272
for a moment, please?

35:49.314 --> 35:51.984
Uh, Emily, they say they can

35:49.314 --> 35:51.984
free up the Gold Room.

35:52.025 --> 35:53.401
How are we supposed to get

35:52.025 --> 35:53.401
a 20 piece band

35:53.443 --> 35:54.736
into the gold room?

35:54.778 --> 35:57.238
- No, we need the Rose Room.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.238
- Right.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.700
I'm afraid the Gold Room won't

35:57.280 --> 36:00.700
do. We need the Rose Room.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.786
'Well, perhaps they would be

36:00.742 --> 36:02.786
willing to switch dates.'

36:02.828 --> 36:04.788
'We'd certainly be happy

36:02.828 --> 36:04.788
to make it worth their while.'

36:04.830 --> 36:06.832
Of course, I'll hold.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.875
Richard, we just have

36:06.873 --> 36:08.875
to get the Rose Room.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.920
Don't you worry. Our company

36:08.917 --> 36:11.920
insures that building.

36:11.962 --> 36:14.131
We don't get that room,

36:11.962 --> 36:14.131
suddenly they have

36:14.172 --> 36:17.926
a very expensive foundation

36:14.172 --> 36:17.926
upgrade to go through.

36:17.968 --> 36:19.719
I married

36:17.968 --> 36:19.719
a wonderful man, girls.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.680
- Yes, you did.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.680
- Uh, mom.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.932
Hey, about this whole

36:21.721 --> 36:23.932
maid-of-honor thing--

36:23.974 --> 36:25.976
Oh, yes. Richard,

36:23.974 --> 36:25.976
can you spare us a moment?

36:26.018 --> 36:27.102
- I wanna take Lorelai upstairs.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.102
- Why?

36:27.144 --> 36:28.520
(Richard)

36:27.144 --> 36:28.520
'Of course.'

36:28.561 --> 36:29.646
What, why do you wanna

36:28.561 --> 36:29.646
take me upstairs?

36:29.688 --> 36:30.981
Wonderful, we'll

36:29.688 --> 36:30.981
be right back.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.398
Why doesn't Rory

36:31.023 --> 36:32.398
have to go upstairs?

36:32.440 --> 36:33.692
(Richard)

36:32.440 --> 36:33.692
'I'll finish this phone call'

36:33.733 --> 36:35.152
'and then Rory

36:33.733 --> 36:35.152
and I will discuss'

36:35.193 --> 36:37.236
'the possibility

36:35.193 --> 36:37.236
of her being my best man.'

36:37.278 --> 36:39.114
(Rory)

36:37.278 --> 36:39.114
'Really, I'm going to be

36:37.278 --> 36:39.114
your best man?'

36:39.156 --> 36:40.323
What's upstairs?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.243
[gasps]

36:44.285 --> 36:46.955
(Celine)

36:44.285 --> 36:46.955
'Ah, Emily, wonderful timing.'

36:46.997 --> 36:49.749
'Please start with

36:46.997 --> 36:49.749
the Oscar De La Renta.'

36:49.791 --> 36:53.211
'Susan Hayward never wore

36:49.791 --> 36:53.211
anything but De La Renta'

36:53.252 --> 36:55.213
'in her final days.'

36:55.254 --> 36:57.465
'Clark Gable never knew

36:55.254 --> 36:57.465
what he was missing.'

36:57.507 --> 36:59.258
[Celine laughs]

36:59.300 --> 37:03.763
He was a cad, but the crease

36:59.300 --> 37:03.763
in his pants was immaculate.

37:03.805 --> 37:04.973
[gasps]

37:05.015 --> 37:08.018
Oh, my God,

37:05.015 --> 37:08.018
it's Natalie Wood.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.978
Hello, Miss Celine.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.978
You look wonderful.

37:10.020 --> 37:13.690
Olive oil on me inside

37:10.020 --> 37:13.690
and on the outside, hm?

37:13.732 --> 37:15.817
Anna Magnani

37:13.732 --> 37:15.817
taught me that.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.652
I think this has

37:15.859 --> 37:17.652
too much lace, Celine.

37:17.694 --> 37:21.031
No, there can't be too much lace

37:17.694 --> 37:21.031
as long as it's Italian.

37:21.073 --> 37:22.699
What do you think, Natalie?

37:22.741 --> 37:24.534
- Yes, what do you think?

37:22.741 --> 37:24.534
- Whatever you want, mom.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.537
Lorelai, you're my maid of

37:24.576 --> 37:27.537
honor. I need your opinion here.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.707
Well, I kinda like that one

37:27.579 --> 37:30.707
or even the one next to it.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.960
- I'll try them both.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.960
- You'll try them all. Ha, ha.

37:34.002 --> 37:37.672
You know, I had the worst row

37:34.002 --> 37:37.672
with Dietrich once.

37:37.714 --> 37:41.968
I told her, "Marlene, until

37:37.714 --> 37:41.968
you actually become a man

37:42.010 --> 37:45.013
"you must try dresses on

37:42.010 --> 37:45.013
like a woman.

37:45.055 --> 37:46.431
And that means

37:45.055 --> 37:46.431
all of them."

37:48.058 --> 37:51.061
- Are you married, Natalie?

37:48.058 --> 37:51.061
- Uh, no, not yet.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.479
(Emily)

37:51.103 --> 37:53.479
'Actually, Celine, she just

37:51.103 --> 37:53.479
opened her own business.'

37:53.521 --> 37:55.190
'She owns an inn now.'

37:55.232 --> 37:57.734
Mm, an inn.

37:55.232 --> 37:57.734
How charming.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.944
[laughs]

37:58.985 --> 38:01.238
Uh, Emily,

37:58.985 --> 38:01.238
do you need breasts

38:01.279 --> 38:03.156
or are yours sufficing

38:01.279 --> 38:03.156
for the moment?

38:03.198 --> 38:04.824
I'm fine for the moment, Celine.

38:04.866 --> 38:07.744
Oh, my God,

38:04.866 --> 38:07.744
you're Mary Martin!

38:07.786 --> 38:09.328
- Take it off immediately!

38:07.786 --> 38:09.328
- Oh, dear.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.414
Here, try this one

38:09.370 --> 38:11.414
on, mom.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.541
You know, I'm trying to decide

38:13.583 --> 38:15.752
'whether to go with a hat'

38:15.794 --> 38:19.172
'or some sort of headpiece

38:15.794 --> 38:19.172
or whether that's too much.'

38:19.214 --> 38:21.091
You know, when I was

38:19.214 --> 38:21.091
dressing Marilyn

38:21.133 --> 38:23.301
for her wedding

38:21.133 --> 38:23.301
to Arthur Miller

38:23.342 --> 38:27.847
I told her, I said "Marilyn,

38:23.342 --> 38:27.847
wear a flat hat on your head.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.934
It will remind him

38:27.889 --> 38:30.934
of a book."

38:30.976 --> 38:34.271
She didn't, and we all saw

38:30.976 --> 38:34.271
how that turned out.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.939
You wear whatever

38:34.312 --> 38:35.939
you want, mom.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.357
Celine, I'm going to need some

38:35.981 --> 38:38.357
help with this zipper.

38:38.399 --> 38:41.527
Oh, very elegant.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.113
Very nice.

38:43.155 --> 38:45.615
Oh! There you go!

38:45.657 --> 38:50.078
Mrs. Oscar Levant

38:45.657 --> 38:50.078
loved that one.

38:50.120 --> 38:54.040
Here, try the Dior

38:50.120 --> 38:54.040
just for giggles.

38:54.082 --> 38:56.042
[chuckles]

38:54.082 --> 38:56.042
Alright.

(Lorelai)

39:06.052 --> 39:07.637
'Aw, you didn't like

39:06.052 --> 39:07.637
your manicotti?'

39:07.679 --> 39:09.306
That was not manicotti.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.725
It was square

39:09.347 --> 39:12.725
and flat and blue.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.435
(Lorelai)

39:12.767 --> 39:14.435
'Yeah, manicotti's

39:14.477 --> 39:15.436
Hm.

39:17.396 --> 39:19.816
You know, I've been thinking, uh

39:19.858 --> 39:23.945
maybe I shouldn't go

39:19.858 --> 39:23.945
to this thing of your parents'.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.698

39:23.987 --> 39:26.698
and now my parents' vow renewal?

39:26.739 --> 39:29.159
I'm serious, I'm not really

39:26.739 --> 39:29.159
their favorite person.

39:29.201 --> 39:30.576
They don't really

39:29.201 --> 39:30.576
want me there.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.120
Hey, I'm not their

39:30.618 --> 39:32.120
favorite person either

39:32.162 --> 39:33.163
and I still have to go.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.290
I know, I just..

39:35.332 --> 39:36.791
It's gonna be

39:35.332 --> 39:36.791
this big fancy thing

39:36.833 --> 39:38.668
with all their friends,

39:36.833 --> 39:38.668
and you know, I just..

39:38.710 --> 39:42.255
Listen, my parents

39:38.710 --> 39:42.255
are very weird people.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.007
They don't hate you.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.007
They just don't know you.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.591
This is the perfect opportunity.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.927
They'll be happy.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.927
They'll be smashed.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.387
You show up,

39:47.969 --> 39:49.387

39:49.428 --> 39:51.264

40:03.442 --> 40:05.444

40:05.486 --> 40:08.198
the very creepy ramifications

40:08.240 --> 40:09.574
of your absence here.

40:09.615 --> 40:10.700
Okay.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.203
Okay? Okay.

Hey!

You got a TV?

Oh, uh, yeah.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.295
What, since when

40:20.585 --> 40:22.295
did you get a TV?

40:22.337 --> 40:24.381
I just picked it up

40:22.337 --> 40:24.381
this morning.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.840
What about your REM sleep?

40:25.882 --> 40:27.675
Hey, twice a week,

40:25.882 --> 40:27.675
you're gonna bed at 9:30

40:27.717 --> 40:30.262
like a 72 year old women

40:27.717 --> 40:30.262
because I have early deliveries.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.264
So the least I could do

40:30.303 --> 40:32.264
is make sure you don't miss

40:32.305 --> 40:33.973
your "Charlie Rosie"

40:32.305 --> 40:33.973
or your "Patrick Stewart."

40:34.015 --> 40:35.141
"Jon Stewart."

40:35.183 --> 40:36.184
I can sleep through anything.

40:36.226 --> 40:37.310
Once I'm out, I'm out.

40:37.352 --> 40:40.521
- Oh, I know.

Now, I have known you a long

And to be completely honest,

41:45.044 --> 41:47.213
I never thought much of you.

- I still don't.

- Wow, it's great of you to

41:47.255 --> 41:50.258

However, you have good breeding.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.095
You come from an impeccable

41:51.843 --> 41:54.095

41:54.137 --> 41:55.847
You've always loved Lorelai.

41:55.888 --> 41:58.266
You would have married her when

41:55.888 --> 41:58.266
she got pregnant, I know that.

41:58.308 --> 42:00.685
And you would have married her

if that girlfriend of yours

42:00.726 --> 42:02.395
hadn't gotten pregnant

Did you know that?

- Yes, I know that.

'He's a divorcee.'

42:09.068 --> 42:10.403

He's not a proper

42:10.445 --> 42:12.447

42:12.489 --> 42:15.241

42:15.283 --> 42:18.036
but she's capable of greatness.

And watching her settle down

42:19.787 --> 42:22.832
with a man who could hold her

42:19.787 --> 42:22.832
back from that is unacceptable.

You, at least,

42:22.874 --> 42:24.709

If you want a chance

with Lorelai

42:34.052 --> 42:35.428
you had better do something.
