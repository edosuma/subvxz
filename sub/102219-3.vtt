13:45.324 --> 13:47.743
Remember when
our calculators were our brain?

13:47.826 --> 13:50.621
Ugh. This was supposed to be
the smart school, right?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.374
Maybe they're doing bigger math.

13:54.041 --> 13:58.379
Yeah, but who just has
a lithium ion 2032 just laying around?

13:58.462 --> 13:59.672
A physicist? Cyborg?

14:01.423 --> 14:02.675
Can I ask you something?

14:02.758 --> 14:03.842
Yeah.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.720
I need to borrow some money.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.766
[sighs] Okay.

14:14.144 --> 14:17.189
It's… more than you got on you.

14:17.940 --> 14:18.941
What's going on?

14:20.442 --> 14:22.695
And I'm gonna need it in ones.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.449
I'm not stealing from the club.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.492
It's for Dean.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.536
-Why do you need ones?
-To get him out.

14:30.619 --> 14:31.912
Beth put you up to this.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.291
-I offered.
-Why?

14:35.374 --> 14:38.335
Because when you were in jail,
she did the same for you.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.172
[sighs]

14:45.384 --> 14:47.803
Maybe there's
one of those batteries in my watch.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.935
Stan, toss me the aloe.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.604
Okay.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.652
I think Mindy used it all.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.613
I got pole-burn bad.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.156
How about some ice?

15:07.239 --> 15:08.407
[muffled song playing]

15:08.490 --> 15:09.491
That's my song.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.204
-Take it easy out there.
-Thanks, Stanimal.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.626
[upbeat dance song playing]

15:29.178 --> 15:30.554
[Gene] Hey, buddy.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.100
Yo. Gene.

15:35.976 --> 15:36.810
Got a sec?

15:36.894 --> 15:39.855
Uh, yeah, man. I was about
to head back out to the floor.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.857
George'll cover you. Have a seat.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.110
All right, always make time for the boss.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.157
So what'd that wife of yours
make you for lunch today?

15:50.240 --> 15:51.116
[chuckles]

15:52.242 --> 15:58.874
Uh, what was today? Uh, penne pasta
with those little green balls.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.377
-Peas?
-No, not those, the other ones. Uh…

16:01.460 --> 16:03.837
-Capers?
-Yep. There it is. Those things.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.967
-She treats you pretty good, huh?
-Yeah, she's the best.

16:09.551 --> 16:10.719
We treat you okay?

16:13.597 --> 16:15.391
Uh, yeah.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.393
You happy here?

16:18.519 --> 16:21.605
[chuckles] Hey, man, I'm glad
to have the job, you know?

16:21.689 --> 16:23.399
-Good to hear, buddy.
-Yeah.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.609
So there's no reason
you'd be upset with me.

16:27.444 --> 16:30.030
-What?
-You'd tell me if you're having problems?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.031
For sure.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.575
-I got your back.
-100%.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.536
You got mine?

16:38.747 --> 16:41.542
'Cause something's
not adding up here, you know?

16:42.209 --> 16:45.254
A few weeks ago,
that thing with the bank truck burning up?

16:45.337 --> 16:48.674
-Oh, yeah, that was crazy. That was…
-Yeah. Crazy.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.926
Crazy how much it cost me.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.179
What, doesn't insurance
cover that stuff? Or--

16:54.263 --> 16:57.349
I have to keep 'em
in the champagne room a little longer.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.643
[laughs]

17:01.311 --> 17:03.147
Yeah, that's why you the king, man.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.024
Can't have it happen again, though.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.861
Not on my watch.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.696
I hear you loud and clear.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.368
All right.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.287
Oh, whenever's good for you,

17:18.370 --> 17:20.539
I'd love to hear
about them private parties

17:20.622 --> 17:23.292
you've been running
behind my back with my girls.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.390
Now is good.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.899
This is currency. Like, top dollar.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.109
You could trade it for anything.

17:49.193 --> 17:53.489
Supplies, TV time, protection.

17:55.157 --> 17:55.991
Who are you?

17:57.117 --> 17:58.118
I know your wife.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.370
I want a lawyer here.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.498
Chill, I just gave you a bunch of ramen.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.881
I had this friend in high school.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.132
Super cool.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.968
-Captain of the cheerleading squad…
-Hmm.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.263
…always had the newest jeans,
the most expensive makeup.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.683
Everyone wanted to be her, including me.

18:23.185 --> 18:26.814
She threw the best parties
and I would bring the wine coolers.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.774
I was, like, in.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.193
We'd go to the movies, the mall.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.613
We were besties before people
used the word "besties."

18:35.614 --> 18:40.911
And then my parents took away my
fake ID and she stopped calling me back.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.540
What's your point?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.460
Women like your wife, they use people.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.755
And when they're done,
they throw 'em in the trash.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.091
So you don't know my wife.

18:54.675 --> 18:58.053
I know the wrong person
is sitting across from me right now.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.145
So what?

19:07.187 --> 19:08.897
I just need something on her.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.570
Without it,
you're gonna need a lot more of these.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.870
So what's it going to be, Mr. Boland?

19:31.003 --> 19:31.879
[young Dean] Hey.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.757
Is your sister home?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.301
Doesn't want to see you.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.846
Did you give her any of my messages?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.682
-Hates your guts.
-She said that?

19:43.765 --> 19:47.269
Thinks you're a total loser,
regrets ever looking at your ugly face,

19:47.352 --> 19:49.354
and wishes you'd just die.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.106
Hmm.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.233
Brutal.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.153
Yeah, so can I just go talk to her?

19:56.236 --> 19:57.613
What's it worth to you?

20:00.073 --> 20:00.991
Wow.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.160
Okay. All right. Fine.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.916
-Four bucks?
-That's all I got.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.334
You can owe me.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.005
-Deansie's here!
-No one calls me that.

20:19.092 --> 20:20.010
Annie.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.971
-Mom needs you.
-[sighs]

20:25.599 --> 20:26.808
What are you doing here?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.894
I called you, like, five times.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.646
[sighs] I've been busy.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.523
-You haven't been at the games.
-I got a lot going on.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.525
-I thought we were cool.
-We are.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.445
-'Cause if I'm way off, it's totally okay.
-It's not that.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.197
I don't want to look like a dick.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.535
-I can't find her meds.
-Be right there.

20:47.663 --> 20:48.622
[sighs]

20:51.250 --> 20:52.251
It's not you.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.294
Gotcha. So it's definitely me, then.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.047
-It's not either of us.
-It's okay. Don't worry about it.

20:57.130 --> 21:00.467
I was going to
ask you to prom, but it's all good.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.638
-You were?
-I don't want to put any pressure on you--

21:04.721 --> 21:05.764
I'd love to go.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.309
Uh, okay.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.186
Cool.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.689
Yeah, cool.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.440
[retches]

21:32.374 --> 21:35.919
Mrs. Boland, he doesn't want to see you.

21:44.928 --> 21:48.640
Turns out if you make a fart noise
with every math problem he gets right,

21:48.724 --> 21:49.850
he can focus.

21:49.933 --> 21:50.976
Got your bills.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.478
How'd it go?

21:56.023 --> 21:57.024
Piece of cake.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.693
I'm gonna pay you back.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.570
It's just going to take a second.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.322
No rush.

22:04.990 --> 22:05.824
Really?

22:08.410 --> 22:09.494
You good?

22:10.787 --> 22:11.913
Just thirsty.

22:14.124 --> 22:17.502
At a certain point,
you don't really need the glass, do you?

22:27.429 --> 22:28.597
Had a day.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.352
[Annie] <i>He'll get over it.</i>

22:35.062 --> 22:36.480
What if he doesn't?

22:37.355 --> 22:38.690
You've done way worse.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.193
I'm a monster.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.030
I mean, he stuck around after
you bone-surfed the guy who shot him.

22:45.113 --> 22:48.617
The kind that climbs
skyscrapers and destroys cities.

22:49.159 --> 22:52.412
Yeah, well, at least
your kids are still talking to you.

22:52.954 --> 22:55.540
-Because they don't know.
-Ben won't even look at me.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.626
Maybe they've all just had enough of us.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.336
[Annie sighs]

23:00.003 --> 23:01.588
God, we are monsters.

23:01.671 --> 23:02.714
[door opens]

23:02.798 --> 23:03.799
[Ruby] Incoming.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.803
Last dance, ladies.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.556
Let's make it a good one.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.599
Not too good.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.018
[upbeat electro song playing]

23:55.600 --> 23:56.810
[Eric] <i>You sure about this?</i>

23:57.811 --> 23:58.770
It'll work.

24:02.482 --> 24:03.608
[Eric] Looks legit.

24:04.192 --> 24:05.068
It's not.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.444
Our worst batch yet.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.655
Your one-way ticket to Shangri-la.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.823
[sighs]

24:14.411 --> 24:15.412
All right.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.415
See you hotties on the other side.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.584
[grunts]

24:37.309 --> 24:38.894
[Eric] I'd like to open a new account.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.687
[woman] Certainly, sir.

24:41.271 --> 24:45.442
I'm just going to need you
to fill out a few forms and a valid ID.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.278
Thank you.

24:48.862 --> 24:52.699
Um, just to let you know,
we do require a minimum balance of $50.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.493
Oh, that won't be a problem. [grunts]

24:57.078 --> 24:58.997
Uh, what are you doing?

24:59.080 --> 25:02.209
Giving you 100,000 smackeroos to babysit.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.671
Um, anything over ten grand
we have to report to the IRS.

25:07.589 --> 25:08.590
Ooh.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.550
That'll be a problem.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.843
Thought it might be.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.847
So how about we do ten grand
in ten different accounts?

25:16.848 --> 25:19.392
Um, we don't do that here, sir.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.310
[Eric] Okay, okay.

25:20.393 --> 25:23.146
Nine grand
in nine different accounts, and…

25:23.980 --> 25:25.649
you keep this for yourself.

25:26.399 --> 25:29.444
-Is there a problem here?
-Uh, yes, there is.

25:29.527 --> 25:31.238
-I'm being profiled.
-Excuse me?

25:31.321 --> 25:34.241
-She won't take my hard-earned money.
-How is that profiling?

25:35.575 --> 25:36.409
Mustache?

25:36.493 --> 25:37.953
That's not a thing.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.996
Sir, we're a family-owned bank.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.957
Then take my money. It's good.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.792
We really don't want any trouble.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.961
Go ahead, test it yourself.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.881
Why would we need to do that?

25:53.051 --> 25:54.386
Been in there a while.

25:54.469 --> 25:57.013
-Can we please just go?
-No. I wanna watch.

25:57.555 --> 25:58.556
Well, I don't.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.725
I feel bad enough as it is.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.978
Shh. Listen.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.562
[siren wailing]

26:06.273 --> 26:07.107
Here we go.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.281
Show them the money.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.998
Ooh! It is on!

26:23.081 --> 26:25.125
[Ruby] Oh, boy, he's getting worked.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.877
Was that necessary?

26:30.338 --> 26:31.548
[Annie] Fell for the honeypot.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.723
Okay, what are they doing now?

26:42.225 --> 26:43.059
All right.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.186
What?

26:45.770 --> 26:46.688
Uh-oh.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.690
[Eric] I go in the back.

26:49.482 --> 26:50.734
Hey, I go in the back.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.652
Hey, guys…

26:53.570 --> 26:54.487
Hey!

26:57.782 --> 26:58.616
[sighs]

27:03.496 --> 27:04.622
What the hell?

27:09.878 --> 27:11.004
What happened?

27:11.588 --> 27:12.839
Think I got robbed.

27:12.922 --> 27:14.174
[Ruby] By cops?

27:17.052 --> 27:18.219
[sighs]

27:27.437 --> 27:28.730
[nurse] She's stable now.

27:28.813 --> 27:32.233
We had to sedate her to pump
her stomach. She'll be out for a while.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.277
Any other family I should notify?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.367
It's just me and my sister.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.287
Your mom's going to be okay.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.071
I went to pick you up.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.281
Oh, God.

28:21.574 --> 28:22.492
What'd she say?

28:22.575 --> 28:24.202
That you didn't want to go.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.246
At least not with me,

28:26.329 --> 28:31.126
'cause I'm the dumbest,
ugliest tool that's ever lived.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.544
I'm going to kill her.

28:35.171 --> 28:38.383
But 40 bucks later, and here I am.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.470
You didn't have to come.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.565
Got you something.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.411
You look great, by the way.

29:06.494 --> 29:07.912
[both chuckle]

29:13.918 --> 29:14.878
So do you.

29:14.961 --> 29:17.297
Pfft. Yeah, oh, I know.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.402
Um, do you want anything
from the vending machine?

29:40.612 --> 29:41.529
No.

29:42.238 --> 29:43.448
Okay, good, 'cause…

29:44.282 --> 29:46.493
your little sister took all my money.

29:46.576 --> 29:47.911
[laughs]

29:50.747 --> 29:51.831
Here's a thought.

29:51.915 --> 29:52.874
Oh, boy.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.667
I go right back in there,

29:54.751 --> 29:56.795
grab that guard's gun, shoot up the place.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.006
-Why?
-Get their attention.

30:00.924 --> 30:04.594
So then they put you in jail
with Dean, and not instead of.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.346
Oh.

30:08.932 --> 30:09.849
Plan C.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.601
-Please no.
-Try a different bank.

30:11.684 --> 30:14.729
And deposit what? Those crooked cops
took everything we made.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.774
Maybe they'll realize it's fake
and come back and nab him.

30:17.857 --> 30:20.276
No. They didn't even look at my ID.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.241
[Annie] Okay. What's plan C?

30:27.659 --> 30:29.452
-Track those guys down.
-The cops?

30:29.536 --> 30:32.163
We pull in front of
their cruiser, jam on the brakes.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.040
[imitates braking] They slam into us.

30:34.123 --> 30:36.584
Bam. Airbags go off.
[imitates airbags inflating]

30:36.668 --> 30:38.837
We hop out,
shatter their window. [exclaims]

30:38.920 --> 30:40.880
-Get the keys to the trunk.
-Make it stop.

30:40.964 --> 30:44.342
How can it possibly be
this difficult to get you arrested?

30:44.884 --> 30:46.219
Because I'm invisible.

30:47.637 --> 30:48.638
What do you mean?

30:49.389 --> 30:51.182
I've been that way my whole life,

30:51.266 --> 30:55.061
smack in the middle of nine kids.
You get used to being left in a hot car.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.354
That's terrible.

30:56.437 --> 30:59.023
All kind of changed for me
when the D-Man got hired.

30:59.732 --> 31:03.361
Brought me to lunch with
the rest of the crew, called me Eric.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.655
-What did everybody else call you?
-Scott.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.449
I see that. He's got a Scott vibe.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.411
-Mmm.
-Anyway, lunch becomes work drinks,

31:11.494 --> 31:14.205
and the next thing you know,
I'm finally a real person.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.792
They don't make them
like Dean Boland anymore.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.504
But I don't need to tell you that.

31:24.173 --> 31:25.049
I know.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.637
-Plan D.
-No more plans, Eric.

31:29.721 --> 31:30.847
[Ruby] Thank Jesus.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.099
What do you want me to do?

31:34.350 --> 31:35.310
Nothing.

31:45.028 --> 31:45.904
Hey.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.072
I made breakfast for dinner.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.825
I'm not hungry.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.168
-What are you doing?
-You are going to eat this.

32:00.251 --> 32:03.171
-Can I go to the bathroom?
-You love breakfast for dinner.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.631
I ate at Mark's house.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.799
Oh. A lacrosse buddy?

32:08.217 --> 32:09.344
What do you want?

32:09.427 --> 32:12.138
I want you to talk to me
like a normal person.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.598
You're not a normal person.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.935
Then talk to me like you want me
to be your mom again, like--

32:17.018 --> 32:20.104
-I don't know what that means.
-Like you don't hate me so much.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.607
'Cause, you know…

32:23.358 --> 32:24.192
if you…

32:25.318 --> 32:26.986
If you're unhappy here, you…

32:28.363 --> 32:30.573
you could always stay at your dad's more.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.868
You think I hate you?

32:37.580 --> 32:39.916
You haven't talked to me in three days.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.085
Doesn't mean I hate you.

32:45.254 --> 32:46.172
Okay.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.300
I love breakfast for dinner.

32:49.926 --> 32:50.760
Me, too.

32:54.597 --> 32:56.349
-Makes sense, though.
-Hmm.

32:56.891 --> 32:59.686
Just for, like,
practice and school and stuff.

32:59.769 --> 33:00.603
What?

33:01.229 --> 33:02.563
Staying with Dad more.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.441
Oh, yeah?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.777
Nancy would never go for it, though.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.697
She's, like, so OCD with Dakota.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.619
-I could talk to her.
-Really?

33:17.453 --> 33:18.371
Why not?

33:18.913 --> 33:21.374
I can just come back
for some of the weekends.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.292
If that's what you want, yeah.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.962
Not that I want it.

33:26.713 --> 33:29.215
It'll just save a lot of time
going back and forth.

33:30.008 --> 33:30.925
Cool.

33:34.637 --> 33:35.805

34:01.247 --> 34:02.790
No classes today?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.834
I don't really teach boot camp.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.295
I don't really sell hot tubs.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.504
Yeah, I know.

34:10.339 --> 34:13.634
Mommy! Look how high I'm going!

34:14.218 --> 34:16.846
Wow! Like an astronaut!

34:22.643 --> 34:24.604
It all started about a year ago.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.232
I robbed a grocery store.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.401
It was supposed to be one and done.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.239
Don't you want to
record this or something?

34:36.574 --> 34:37.492
Doesn't matter.

34:38.785 --> 34:39.702
Why?

34:42.538 --> 34:44.540
Your husband pled guilty today.

34:48.711 --> 34:51.255
[girl] Mommy! Mommy, watch me!

35:02.308 --> 35:03.643
Jesus!

35:04.727 --> 35:09.065
Your elderly neighbor was getting
curious the longer I stood at your door.

35:12.193 --> 35:15.321
Why does everyone think
they can let themselves into my house?

35:15.404 --> 35:18.950
These things are easy to find
once you know what you're looking for.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.496
-I'd offer you a drink, but…
-All set.

35:29.418 --> 35:31.254
I can't go to Fiji with you.

Why not?

-Perfect time for an escape.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.980
-And I have kids.
-Happy to make arrangements for them.

35:49.063 --> 35:51.732

to be tied up for a while.

-Let's go.

-Now?
-Why? Need a pill?

36:02.118 --> 36:03.995
I've got to pick up my kids soon.

36:04.662 --> 36:07.290
-I think there's been a misunderstanding.
-Really?

36:07.915 --> 36:11.752
Because you have made it very clear
that this is exactly what I need to do.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.254
Not like this.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.256
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.760
Was I supposed to enjoy it?
Maybe fall in love with you?

36:20.344 --> 36:24.182
End up on some remote island so you
can live out your twisted midlife crisis?

36:27.101 --> 36:28.436
I thought you wanted…

36:30.313 --> 36:31.147
more.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.398
From you?

36:32.481 --> 36:33.566
From your life.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.819
Oh, and I need a man to do that?

36:39.322 --> 36:41.824
-What do you want?
-To be nothing like you.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.451
-A little late for that.
-Why?

36:43.534 --> 36:45.453
You hired me, remember?

36:47.371 --> 36:50.458
Then why don't you
pull up your pants like a big boy

36:50.541 --> 36:52.168
and do your job?

37:02.511 --> 37:03.346
Well…

37:08.434 --> 37:10.019
It seems I read this all wrong.

37:10.853 --> 37:13.064

He's a little bitch.

He alone?

38:38.316 --> 38:41.319
-No, he lives with his brother.
-And what's he look like?

A big bitch.

the money?
