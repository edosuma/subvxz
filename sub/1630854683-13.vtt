00:08.308 --> 00:10.308
What? Huh? Uh...

00:10.444 --> 00:12.511
- I'm going to go to bed.
- Aw, but you'll miss the part

Where she takes

00:13.681 --> 00:16.115

01:38.532 --> 01:40.398
Hey, you want to walk
to work together?

01:40.468 --> 01:42.334
Ooh, no time. Got to go.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.336

01:45.372 --> 01:47.506
We going to unpack what's

01:49.777 --> 01:52.778
So, what are you kids

02:03.691 --> 02:05.557
Let me guess. Hanging
out with hudson?

02:05.692 --> 02:07.091
Another day in paradise.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.494
You two really stepped
it up this year.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.695
I'm proud of you.

02:12.099 --> 02:17.102
Okay. That was adorable.
(laughing) what?

02:21.575 --> 02:24.176
Andrew, we know what you
have been up to.

02:24.178 --> 02:27.445
Call me or I will hunt you down.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.580
I told you not to get caught.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.114
Bureaucrats can't catch me!

02:31.852 --> 02:34.119
Free as a bird,
baby. Thanks, bourne movies.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.788
Well, she's suspicious, and
if she's suspicious,

02:36.857 --> 02:39.257
That means that you're
going to-- andrew? Andrew!

02:39.326 --> 02:40.425
Jah! The bourne identity!

02:40.560 --> 02:42.194
God damn, I hate that fireplace!

02:45.166 --> 02:46.130

02:49.269 --> 02:50.935
- Treats for the spreadsheets.
- Oh,

02:50.937 --> 02:53.271
And a homemade lavender
bomb for your bath, cath.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.541
This actually batch
turned out real nice.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.609
Mm. Ah, spoil me.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.178
You know it.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.812
- Hey, mannix.
- Hey.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.616
Well, I better
get to it.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.617
Put it on my tab.

03:05.653 --> 03:06.884
Will do. See you.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.323
Can I ask you something that's
a little weird?

03:11.392 --> 03:13.558
Uh, yeah. Of
course. Anything.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.561
Is cathy hooking up
with my dad?

03:20.067 --> 03:23.035
Oh, my god. You're--
you're making me nervous.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.370
It's just a weekly segment
on a morning show.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.939
Just the number one rated
morning show in the country.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.707
Okay. So, should
I be nervous?

03:28.776 --> 03:31.042
No. No. You're
going to be great.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.711
I just want this for
you so bad!

03:32.780 --> 03:34.178
For us! (laughing)

03:34.215 --> 03:36.381
- Please, hold still.
- Oh, yeah.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.815
Woman:
Ah, there she is.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.451
Hi. I'm meera, the
producer.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.052
Oh, my god.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.888
Yeah. Uh, so, you
feeling ready?

03:42.890 --> 03:45.724
I think so. I-- I haven't
ever done an audition before.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.026
Oh, there's nothing to
be worried about.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.127
Gloria loves your work.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.295
Oh, really?

03:50.430 --> 03:52.798
So, how's xavier

03:52.800 --> 03:54.232

03:54.268 --> 03:57.402
- Sam: Yep. Great.
- You have a boss?

03:57.537 --> 03:59.070
Meera:
Yeah. X and I go way back.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.406
She said that you are the
best lawyer they've recruited

04:01.408 --> 04:02.774
- To the firm in years.
- Oh.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.742
- (phone beeping)
- oh. I got to run,

04:04.778 --> 04:08.280
- But I'll see you out there.
- Okay. (laughing)

04:08.415 --> 04:09.814
You're working
at a firm?

04:09.850 --> 04:12.083
Uh, let's talk about
it later, okay?

04:12.119 --> 04:14.753
- Are you working at a firm?
- (sam stammering)

04:14.755 --> 04:16.021
Please, stop moving.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.356
Don't tell
me. Tell her.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.791
Please, stop moving.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.232
Hudson,
I'm impressed.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.367
You've really
stepped up your game.

04:29.403 --> 04:32.104
Well, a lot of that is
thanks to andrew.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.706

04:44.785 --> 04:46.718

- My pleasure. Yeah.

Robin. You're robin,

05:47.447 --> 05:49.180
And no,
no, you can't,

05:49.216 --> 05:51.416
Because he's not
here anymore,

05:51.551 --> 05:52.717
Because I fired him.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.386
So, he moved on,

05:55.388 --> 05:57.856
And he could be
anywhere in the world,

carmen sandiego.

with her right now.

He's in the

Okay. You know how
in the movies,

They write down a number
on a piece of paper

07:14.802 --> 07:16.334

I am always the one

And half the time,
you're too busy to work.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.901
And I get it. Your family

How long it takes to get

Interesting methods,

You've done more this past

So, tell us about it.
What inspired you?

10:04.605 --> 10:07.472
Um, can I just have a--
a minute, actually?

10:07.541 --> 10:09.007
Meera:
Uh, this won't take long.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.309
Just a few questions and
a bit of you cooking,

10:11.311 --> 10:12.910
- And then we're done.
- Yeah. No, no, no.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.245
Of course. Just, um...

10:15.949 --> 10:17.114
What was the
question?

10:20.420 --> 10:21.986
You see it,
though, right?

10:22.055 --> 10:23.655
Cathy and my dad?

10:23.790 --> 10:26.391
- Not really.
- No? Oh, okay.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.727
Maybe I'm just...
Overthinking it. (chuckling)

10:29.763 --> 10:32.029
I should probably get
out of here. (chuckling)

10:32.065 --> 10:33.330
Uh, wait.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.366
I mean, I hadn't
really thought of it,

10:35.435 --> 10:37.736
But now that you mention it,
they are pretty close.

10:37.871 --> 10:38.970
- Yeah.
- I mean,

10:39.105 --> 10:41.539
Maybe we could figure
it out together?

10:41.575 --> 10:44.642
Yeah, and maybe I could get
one of your café crèmes?

10:44.678 --> 10:45.577
(chuckling)

10:45.712 --> 10:47.345
Okay. Lay it on me.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.348
Okay. You remember that
woman robin?

10:50.350 --> 10:52.483
I can't keep track
of your life.

10:52.519 --> 10:57.288
Fair. So, the municipality of
rockridge created a job for me.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.692
I'd be getting paid to make
the community a better place.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.728
But working with hudson might
be my new dream.

11:03.863 --> 11:06.831
But this is a
big opportunity.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.901
But what about my
dawg huddy-hud?

11:09.903 --> 11:11.469
That's a doozy.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.804
You should
talk to mom.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.039
That's a good idea.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.909
I should get back
to the office.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.244
Thanks for
the chat, big man.

11:27.854 --> 11:28.986

11:34.261 --> 11:37.195
- Hit me up with a mango boba.
- Ah, looks like bieber

11:37.197 --> 11:39.597
Still needs to
acquire some taste.

11:39.599 --> 11:42.200
I still like bubble
tea more, too.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.334
I'll be right back.

You and mannix back
together?

Is that a
ghost? Nani ji?

11:51.178 --> 11:54.145
No, and we're just
trying to figure out

If cathy and
hudson are dating.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.484
Hey. Those
lights work?

11:59.486 --> 12:03.254
Nope. You hooking
up with hudson?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.890
- Sorry. What?
- It's a simple question, cathy.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.426
Are you and
hudson an item?

12:08.495 --> 12:11.562
Uh, no,
michael cera.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.897
We're just friends.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.365
Why? What's this about?

with you.

This is my chance

12:23.043 --> 12:25.576
- To reconnect with mannix.
- Or you could just...

12:25.612 --> 12:27.145
Talk to her.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.647
Also, who's
michael cera?

12:29.783 --> 12:30.714
He real manly?

Never mind.

I'll google.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.589
Whew! So, how're we going
to figure this out?

12:39.893 --> 12:41.792
Oh.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.661
Hudson: Hey, buddy. Did
robin catch you?

12:43.663 --> 12:46.998
- Yeah, eventually.
- Well, I got some good news

12:47.133 --> 12:48.533
That'll turn around
this whole day.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.768
- Okay.
- I made you partner!

12:52.338 --> 12:53.605
- What?
- Ever since you started

12:53.740 --> 12:55.673
Working here,
we've doubled my clients,

12:55.742 --> 12:57.741
We're more efficient,
and companies like jane's

12:57.778 --> 12:59.877
Are actually interested
in my services.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.013
Check it out.

"accounting ballers
making dollars"?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.249
That's us!

13:06.653 --> 13:07.785
Flip it over.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.223
Aw! Aw!

13:13.393 --> 13:16.961
Uh... I got to...

13:16.963 --> 13:18.696

early, but okay.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.304
(music playing)

13:26.439 --> 13:28.206
Because, I mean, who hasn't got
in a fight in the back

13:28.275 --> 13:30.408
Of a convenience store
over a bag of flour?

13:30.410 --> 13:32.644
Sorry. I just asked what your
family likes to eat.

13:32.646 --> 13:37.048
Um, I... I don't know.
I'm sorry.

13:37.183 --> 13:40.184
You-- you don't know
what your family likes to eat?

13:40.187 --> 13:41.519
- Camille: I...
- (phone buzzing)

13:41.521 --> 13:43.254
Andrew: (on recording) babe,
it's your phone!

13:43.290 --> 13:44.589
- Pick it up!
- What is that?

13:44.658 --> 13:46.391
Andrew: Babe, pick
up your phone!

13:46.393 --> 13:47.892
- Why aren't you picking up?
- Camille: Um, uh,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.461
That's my phone. Can I just have
two minutes to collect myself?

13:50.597 --> 13:52.330
Meera: Okay. I'm--
I don't really think

13:52.332 --> 13:53.231
That's going to
be necessary.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.733
No, no, no, no! No!

13:58.538 --> 14:00.204
Meera:
What are you doing?

14:00.207 --> 14:02.307
Oh, my god.
She was on fire.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.009
Can you believe that?
How crazy is that?

14:05.011 --> 14:07.278
No, I wasn't!
I wasn't!

14:07.314 --> 14:10.547
- So glad that you called.
- Everything okay?

14:10.584 --> 14:13.151
Uh, not really, but
just tell me about your day.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.752
I kind of need to forget
about this right now.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.420
- (beeping)
- andrew: You know

14:16.456 --> 14:18.222
How robin's been trying
to track me down?

14:18.291 --> 14:21.092
Well, she
offered me a job,

14:21.094 --> 14:22.493
And then hudson made
me partner.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.096
Oh, my god.
Babe, that's incredible.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.432
I know, but
I can't do both!

14:27.567 --> 14:30.567
Well, which one
do you want to do?

14:30.604 --> 14:33.704
Honestly, I thought it would
be working with hudson,

14:33.740 --> 14:36.307
But when he offered me
the partnership,

14:36.309 --> 14:38.242
It just didn't
feel right,

14:38.278 --> 14:40.411
Not with my dream job
on the line.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.347
Sounds like you
have your answer.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.183
Andrew: (sighing) I can't
hurt hudson, though!

14:45.318 --> 14:47.051
He's so happy!

14:47.053 --> 14:48.519
Camille:
He'll understand.

14:48.654 --> 14:51.923
This is a... A
great opportunity.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.392
Sam: Or you could thank me for
not being on fire anymore.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.393
You know, as-- as
your lawyer,

14:56.429 --> 14:58.595
You are welcome for
eliminating the chance

14:58.632 --> 15:01.532
Of spontaneous...
Fire lawsuits.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.167
What?

15:03.203 --> 15:06.003
Uh, camille? How'd
the audition go?

15:06.072 --> 15:08.339
Oh, uh, not great. Just
kind of in the middle of it

15:08.375 --> 15:09.540
- Right now.
- Andrew: Why did you

15:09.576 --> 15:11.408
- Answer the phone?
- I don't know.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.677
You give
me confidence.

15:12.679 --> 15:16.080
Andrew:
Aw! You love me so much!

15:16.215 --> 15:17.682
Deal with it. I
got to go.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.584
- Andrew: Love you, babe.
- Love you, too.

15:20.654 --> 15:23.087
Sam, thank you for
being so careful

15:23.156 --> 15:25.623
When it comes
to fire safety.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.592
But if you don't mind,
I got an audition to crush.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.295
- Uh, shall we begin again?
- Yeah. I think we're done here.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.297
My name is
camille pham,

15:33.333 --> 15:34.498
And when I was 14
years old,

15:34.534 --> 15:36.167
My mom passed away.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.504
And ever since, I've been
remixing her recipes

15:39.639 --> 15:42.173
To bring friends
and family together

15:42.242 --> 15:43.774
Around the
dinner table,

15:43.810 --> 15:46.677
To create the moments I
didn't get with her.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.854
(shouting) andrew, why
is my stapler on your desk?

15:56.990 --> 15:59.190
- Because I was stapling?
- How long have you been

15:59.192 --> 16:00.324
Stealing from
the firm?

16:00.326 --> 16:01.592
- What?
- I can't believe

16:01.594 --> 16:02.827
I was going to
make you partner.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.663
You're fired! Go on!
Get out of here!

and the hendersons-ing me?

16:10.403 --> 16:12.503
No!

16:12.638 --> 16:14.271
You heard everything,
didn't you?

16:14.341 --> 16:15.473
Why didn't you tell
me about robin?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.608
Because I just
found out!

16:17.644 --> 16:19.810
And if I don't accept the job
by 5:00pm, I lose it!

16:19.846 --> 16:21.178
Well, what are
you waiting for?

16:21.214 --> 16:22.213

You sure?

16:31.290 --> 16:32.389
I'm sure, man.

going to make it.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.044
Okay. I need to get another
part for this thing.

Okay. No problem.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.053
Okay. This is our chance.

Hudson. No.
Okay. Huddy? No.

(sighing) they're
just friends.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.761
- How do you know?
- I just found out,

17:09.896 --> 17:11.329
And I didn't tell
you right away

17:11.331 --> 17:12.463
Because we're
finally hanging out.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.566
- Khia.
- I'm sorry.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.136
I don't want to keep
anything from you anymore,

17:18.138 --> 17:22.473

messed everything up before.

You've avoided
me all year,

19:35.175 --> 19:37.808
Co-heads of the community
development department.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.410
Are you f-ing
kidding me?

19:39.412 --> 19:40.877
See you Monday.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.281
(bob snickering)

19:44.317 --> 19:45.582
This is going
to be fun.

19:48.922 --> 19:49.886
(sighing)

19:54.360 --> 19:55.792
Who dented my car?

19:57.931 --> 19:59.564
- Andrew: Okay.
- (camille talking indistinctly)

19:59.699 --> 20:01.799
Everyone, a toast.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.435
It's been a big year.
Lots of changes.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.737
But one thing
will never change.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.772
We've always
got each other.

20:08.774 --> 20:12.043
Here's to work friends
becoming friend friends.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.644
And to camille's
new cooking segment.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.379
And andrew's
new job.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.315
And sam's new job.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.716
Andrew:

20:18.785 --> 20:20.251
- Hudson: Yeah.
- Cheers.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.185
Cheers, man.

20:22.788 --> 20:23.720
(andrew stammering)

20:23.756 --> 20:25.189
Hudson:
Oh!

20:25.191 --> 20:26.457
Stop.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.525
Are you two--

20:28.561 --> 20:30.127
Just friends.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.663
I'll tell you
about it later.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.198
You know what? I,
uh, I have an idea.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.068
(shouting) leo, do you want to
come down here for a minute?

20:37.203 --> 20:40.937
Oh, uh, maybe don't mention, uh,
leo's little, uh, moustache.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.673
We're rolling
with it.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.008
- Oh.
- Khia: Hey.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.009
What?

20:45.078 --> 20:46.143
You shaved.

20:46.179 --> 20:48.912
Yeah. The 'stache
was making moby sad.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.515
- He doesn't have pubes yet--
- okay. Let's, uh, keep

20:51.584 --> 20:53.284
Moby's pube situation
on the down low.

20:53.286 --> 20:56.486
I got pubes
last year. No biggie.

20:56.522 --> 20:57.888
(laughing)
good for you.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.157
Oh, babe, you one
of the wet bandits now?

21:00.159 --> 21:02.693
No. Now that we're
making some real money,

21:02.695 --> 21:04.428
I am unsticking
the flue,

21:04.563 --> 21:07.564
And we are putting in
a gas fireplace.

21:07.566 --> 21:08.399
- Hudson: Hey, alright.
- Andrew: Okay!

21:08.534 --> 21:11.201
(sam, khia cheering)

21:11.271 --> 21:12.937
- Camille: There we go.
- (animal chittering)

21:12.939 --> 21:16.006
Racoon! It's in
the house!

21:16.042 --> 21:20.644
(all screaming)

21:20.680 --> 21:23.113
Don't look at it in
the eyes! (screaming)
