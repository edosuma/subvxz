00:03.220 --> 00:04.743
We're about to have dinner.

00:04.874 --> 00:05.875
Don't ruin your appetite.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
It's called pre-gaming.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.707
Who wants to go
to heaven?

00:11.837 --> 00:13.926
Eventually or now?

00:14.710 --> 00:16.494
I'm doing a fundraiser
for Afghanistan.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.843
It is a spin-a-thon.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.236
We ride stationary bikes,

00:19.367 --> 00:21.195
and the longer we go,
the more money we raise.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.023
Oh, cool. How'd you get
hooked up with that?

00:23.153 --> 00:24.285
Ariana invited me.

00:24.415 --> 00:25.547
Oh.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.723
Is this going
to be a bicycle built for two?

00:27.853 --> 00:30.856
Don't be dirty, Lizzie.
You're better than that.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.206
So...

00:32.336 --> 00:34.034
you think
you still got a shot with her?

00:34.164 --> 00:36.645
This is purely
about the people in need.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.951
If I ride the most miles
and raise the most money,

00:39.082 --> 00:42.216
and Ariana thinks I'm a hero,
that can't be helped.

00:42.346 --> 00:43.478
Can I do it, too?

00:43.608 --> 00:45.567
Absolutely.
And if you find yourself

00:45.697 --> 00:48.222
admiring my endurance loud
enough that she can hear you,

00:48.352 --> 00:50.398
that also can't be helped.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.140
Are you sure you can do it?

00:53.270 --> 00:54.489
I've never even
seen you ride a bike before.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.012
So? I've never seen you
brush your teeth.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.797
I do, all the time.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.930
And of course I can
ride a bike, Hazel.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.540
I learned when I was six.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.325
Yeah? I learned
when I was three.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.675
[sputters]
No, you didn't.Ask Freddy. He taught me.

01:06.805 --> 01:09.591
Freddy taught you
how to ride a bike?

01:09.721 --> 01:10.809
Yeah.

01:12.637 --> 01:13.943

01:14.074 --> 01:16.206
[high-pitched voice]:
What? Yeah, I'm fine.

01:16.337 --> 01:19.644
Bring it down an octave
and try again.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.609
Wow. That's a lot of gear.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.046
There a zombie uprising
no one told me about?

01:30.177 --> 01:31.352
I'm taking Hazel hunting.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.397
Oh, fun.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.444
I loved doing all that
stuff with you and Liz.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.272
Wanted to pack in
all the memories

01:38.402 --> 01:41.884
before you two grew up
and moved away. [laughs]

01:42.014 --> 01:44.060
Ah, what a dope.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.497
I can't stand thinking
about all the stuff

01:46.628 --> 01:48.369
I missed with Hazel
when I was deployed.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.806
Is this because Freddy
taught her how to ride a bike?

01:50.936 --> 01:53.635
Where'd you hear about that?Your sister's a blabbermouth.

01:53.765 --> 01:56.116
Well, I'm fixing it now.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.422
Hazel and I are coming home
with a truck full

01:58.553 --> 02:01.121
of cold deer
and warm memories.Hmm.

02:01.251 --> 02:04.167
Hey, Dad.There she is.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.777
Hey, Dugans.Hey, Freddy.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.039
What's all this?

02:07.170 --> 02:08.389
I'm taking Hazel bow-hunting.

02:08.519 --> 02:09.651
No way!Mm-hmm.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.305
That's the first
I'm hearing about it.

02:11.435 --> 02:14.003
Sorry. Do I need
your permission?No.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.877
Good. But do I have
your permission?

02:19.008 --> 02:21.141
Yes.Yes.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.186

Oh, I always am.Yeah, right.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.934
Do remember when you took me
fishing with dynamite?

02:32.064 --> 02:33.414
Nobody got hurt,

02:33.544 --> 02:34.850
except all the fish.

You murdered fish
with explosives?

02:39.550 --> 02:42.249
Oh, calm down, Freddy.
It just stuns 'em.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.556
Makes it easier to scoop
'em up and then murder 'em.

Like what? I haven't been
paying attention in school

09:52.722 --> 09:53.941
since we did shapes.

09:54.071 --> 09:57.118
Ask me the capital
of anywhere, I have no idea!

Keep it up!

10:06.214 --> 10:08.782
Breathe it!
Breathe it!

10:08.912 --> 10:10.479
This is great.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.612
It's nice to be on a bicycle
without being distracted

10:12.742 --> 10:14.439
by beautiful scenery

10:14.570 --> 10:16.006

in your face.

Are you crying?

10:20.445 --> 10:21.621
I have a leg cramp.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.318
It hurts so bad!

10:24.058 --> 10:25.581
Okay, ten minute break.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.583
Oh... already?

10:27.714 --> 10:28.628
Ah.

10:28.758 --> 10:29.672
Oh, man.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.239
I am so tight.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.501
Ah, let me help
you with that.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.981
Thanks.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.070
Ooh, you must be
a Boy Scout,

10:36.200 --> 10:37.898
because you have
so many knots.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.508
[laughs]

10:39.639 --> 10:41.292
Where is the joke?

10:41.423 --> 10:43.251
Tell me where the joke is.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.475
What are we trying
to find?

10:50.606 --> 10:53.174
Wrongs that
need righting.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.045
Fine.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.568
Don't tell me.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.701
Promise you
won't laugh?

10:59.702 --> 11:01.312
No.

11:02.618 --> 11:03.837
Graffiti.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.448
I paint over graffiti.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.015
Really?

11:08.145 --> 11:10.408
Yeah, it's a
serious problem.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.628
I mean, when someone gets
robbed, there's one victim.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.544
With graffiti... the
whole community suffers.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.678
It really burns my biscuits.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.681
When did this start?

11:21.811 --> 11:23.552
Ah, it's a long story.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.641
Tell me.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.599
Well, my wife
was a realtor.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.559
She studied hard,
got her license.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.432
It was a proud day when
she got her first bus bench.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.565
And a week later...

11:37.697 --> 11:39.742
...I can't even tell ya
what they did to her picture.

11:39.873 --> 11:42.136
Cops said, "Let it go," but...

11:42.266 --> 11:44.268
I couldn't.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.839
That's surprisingly sexy.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.886
Not now, Lois,
we got a job to do.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.633
You know, I didn't even
want to be a Marine

12:01.764 --> 12:03.635
when I was your age.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.073
I was gonna be
a stuntman.

12:06.203 --> 12:09.076
I was really good
at jumping off roofs.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.644
Once I jumped off the gym
and landed on the principal.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.125

12:16.300 --> 12:18.476
Stop trying
to make me feel better.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.435
Sorry.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.875
I just wanted us
to do something cool together.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.227
Don't worry about it.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.631

What's "Fishstick?"

14:15.985 --> 14:17.813
It's a who.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.250
Okay, who's Fishstick?

14:20.381 --> 14:21.861
My nemesis.

Do they?

14:31.696 --> 14:33.220
Okay, here's the deal.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.744
The city works
with three garbage contractors.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.050
Each one uses

14:37.180 --> 14:38.834
a different color green
on their dumpsters.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.054
You got your fern,

but don't worry.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.580

Okay, let me do
the talking.

can you cut me a break?

So just to be clear,

16:17.802 --> 16:20.457
the woman you're interested
in is over there by herself,

16:20.588 --> 16:22.329

Huh?
[exhales]

16:32.643 --> 16:35.298
You know, I have this theory
that, uh, Fishstick is

16:35.429 --> 16:38.171
actually two people
working together.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.173
It would explain how he, uh,
tagged the stop sign

16:40.303 --> 16:42.523
on 5th and the wall
behind Dress Mart

16:42.653 --> 16:44.873
on the same night.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.701
I don't know
if it's the exhilaration

16:46.831 --> 16:48.311
of doing something illegal

16:48.442 --> 16:50.487
or breathing in
all these fumes, but...

16:50.618 --> 16:52.359
I feel alive.

16:53.447 --> 16:54.883
That's how it starts.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.798
Next thing you know,
you're painting a water tower

16:56.928 --> 16:57.929
in the middle of January.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.453
"A water tower"?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.803
Where Fishstick goes, I go.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.807
Want to hear something crazy?What?

17:05.937 --> 17:08.201
This is kind of turning me on.

Well, let's head home.

and I was so busy

18:15.398 --> 18:17.574

I didn't even think about
it until she came back

18:21.230 --> 18:23.058
so excited.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.799
And then it hit me.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.281
That's a memory
you don't get.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.633
I'm sorry.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.637

Hazel says she's
a vegetarian now.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.650

19:03.794 --> 19:04.969
I don't know the word "quit."

19:05.100 --> 19:06.188
Why don't you get off your bike

19:06.319 --> 19:07.407
and go look it up?

19:07.537 --> 19:08.843
All right, that's enough.
