WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:04.743
We're about to have dinner.

00:04.874 --> 00:05.875
Don't ruin your appetite.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
It's called pre-gaming.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.707
Who wants to go
to heaven?

00:11.837 --> 00:13.926
Eventually or now?

00:14.710 --> 00:16.494
I'm doing a fundraiser
for Afghanistan.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.843
It is a spin-a-thon.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.236
We ride stationary bikes,

00:19.367 --> 00:21.195
and the longer we go,
the more money we raise.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.023
Oh, cool. How'd you get
hooked up with that?

00:23.153 --> 00:24.285
Ariana invited me.

00:24.415 --> 00:25.547
Oh.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.723
Is this going
to be a bicycle built for two?

00:27.853 --> 00:30.856
Don't be dirty, Lizzie.
You're better than that.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.206
So...

00:32.336 --> 00:34.034
you think
you still got a shot with her?

00:34.164 --> 00:36.645
This is purely
about the people in need.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.951
If I ride the most miles
and raise the most money,

00:39.082 --> 00:42.216
and Ariana thinks I'm a hero,
that can't be helped.

00:42.346 --> 00:43.478
Can I do it, too?

00:43.608 --> 00:45.567
Absolutely.
And if you find yourself

00:45.697 --> 00:48.222
admiring my endurance loud
enough that she can hear you,

00:48.352 --> 00:50.398
that also can't be helped.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.140
Are you sure you can do it?

00:53.270 --> 00:54.489
I've never even
seen you ride a bike before.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.012
So? I've never seen you
brush your teeth.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.797
I do, all the time.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.930
And of course I can
ride a bike, Hazel.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.540
I learned when I was six.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.325
Yeah? I learned
when I was three.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.675
[sputters]
No, you didn't.Ask Freddy. He taught me.

01:06.805 --> 01:09.591
Freddy taught you
how to ride a bike?

01:09.721 --> 01:10.809
Yeah.

01:12.637 --> 01:13.943
Dude, you okay?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.206
[high-pitched voice]:
What? Yeah, I'm fine.

01:16.337 --> 01:19.644
Bring it down an octave
and try again.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.609
Wow. That's a lot of gear.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.046
There a zombie uprising
no one told me about?

01:30.177 --> 01:31.352
I'm taking Hazel hunting.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.397
Oh, fun.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.444
I loved doing all that
stuff with you and Liz.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.272
Wanted to pack in
all the memories

01:38.402 --> 01:41.884
before you two grew up
and moved away. [laughs]

01:42.014 --> 01:44.060
Ah, what a dope.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.497
I can't stand thinking
about all the stuff

01:46.628 --> 01:48.369
I missed with Hazel
when I was deployed.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.806
Is this because Freddy
taught her how to ride a bike?

01:50.936 --> 01:53.635
Where'd you hear about that?Your sister's a blabbermouth.

01:53.765 --> 01:56.116
Well, I'm fixing it now.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.422
Hazel and I are coming home
with a truck full

01:58.553 --> 02:01.121
of cold deer
and warm memories.Hmm.

02:01.251 --> 02:04.167
Hey, Dad.There she is.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.777
Hey, Dugans.Hey, Freddy.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.039
What's all this?

02:07.170 --> 02:08.389
I'm taking Hazel bow-hunting.

02:08.519 --> 02:09.651
No way!Mm-hmm.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.305
That's the first
I'm hearing about it.

02:11.435 --> 02:14.003
Sorry. Do I need
your permission?No.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.877
Good. But do I have
your permission?

02:19.008 --> 02:21.141
Yes.Yes.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.186
Have fun, Hazel.Thanks, Mom.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.666
Go hit the head.
We got a long drive.

02:24.796 --> 02:25.971
Yes, sir.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.321
Just be safe, okay?

02:27.451 --> 02:29.453
Oh, I always am.Yeah, right.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.934
Do remember when you took me
fishing with dynamite?

02:32.064 --> 02:33.414
Nobody got hurt,

02:33.544 --> 02:34.850
except all the fish.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.330
[both laugh]

02:36.460 --> 02:39.420
You murdered fish
with explosives?

02:39.550 --> 02:42.249
Oh, calm down, Freddy.
It just stuns 'em.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.556
Makes it easier to scoop
'em up and then murder 'em.

02:45.687 --> 02:46.557
[both laugh]

02:46.688 --> 02:47.689
â™ª

02:47.819 --> 02:49.212
â™ª Oh!

02:59.875 --> 03:01.311
Stop.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.748
What's the matter?

03:03.879 --> 03:06.534
She is so beautiful,
I need a moment.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.189
You are a hopeless romantic.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.582
Hopeful.
The word is "hopeful."

03:11.713 --> 03:13.062
Hey.Hey.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.542
You made it!Ah.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.544
You invite and I don't come?
Impossible.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.676
You remember Lizzie?Of course.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.374
I really
appreciate you being here.

03:20.504 --> 03:21.766
Oh, it's a great cause.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.551
And nice to know
I'm still cute enough

03:23.681 --> 03:25.335
to get money from strangers.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.382
What an impressive
number of pledges.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.210
Almost as many as me.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.472
Well, you're still cute enough

03:31.602 --> 03:33.256
to get money
from strangers, too.

03:33.387 --> 03:34.692
Hmm.
[chuckles]

03:35.954 --> 03:37.042
She called you cute.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.175
I amcute.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.525
Ari?!Dirk?!

03:41.656 --> 03:43.092
Thank you so much
for doing this.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.572
Ah, anything for you.

03:44.702 --> 03:47.705
Hey, Al and Lizzie,
meet Dirk, my spin teacher.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.011
AL:
Huh.

03:50.404 --> 03:51.231
What's to teach?
It's just pedaling.ARIANA: Oh.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.928
I'm also a
personal trainer.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.104
Ah.If you ever want a one-on-one,
you give me a call.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.281
You have a great frame. I could
get you shredded or jacked.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.717
We can go either way.Oh.

03:59.848 --> 04:03.243
Thank you, but I am fine
jacking my own frame.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.073
Hey, boyfriend.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.641
Come on in, girlfriend.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.213
Hear that?

04:17.344 --> 04:18.736
I don't hear anything.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.261
I got the house
to myself.So?

04:21.391 --> 04:23.219
So, I got the house to myself.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.439
Ah.[laughing]

04:25.569 --> 04:27.615
I don't think
this has happened in years.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.312
Well, what are we doing
standing around talking?

04:29.443 --> 04:30.444
Should we go
to your room?

04:30.574 --> 04:31.793
Well, we'll get there.

04:31.923 --> 04:34.143
Right now, we got a fire
in the fireplace,

04:34.274 --> 04:38.452
Al Green on the turntable,
and that chair fully reclines.

04:38.582 --> 04:42.760
Well, then, shall I say,
let's get it on?

04:42.891 --> 04:45.285
That's Marvin Gaye,
but I'll-I'll let it slide.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.635
[laughing]

04:51.378 --> 04:53.641
Dad, Dad,
what's that over there?

04:55.425 --> 04:57.558
[whispering]:
I think it's a rock.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.343
I'm gonna shoot it.No.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.127
Don't.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.215
Why?

05:03.346 --> 05:05.087
You have to know what it is.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.307
You just said it was a rock.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.657
Just be patient.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.833
Think about
those delicious Bambi burgers

05:11.963 --> 05:14.488
we're gonna be eating
for the next six months.

05:14.618 --> 05:17.273
Maybe let's not
name the animals.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.927
[laughs]
You know, this one time,

05:19.057 --> 05:21.146
Grampy and I were sitting
in a tree like this.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.323
He let out a giant fart.

05:23.453 --> 05:26.021
Turns out there were, like,
20 deer right below us,

05:26.151 --> 05:28.719
and they ran off like
it was the end of the world.

05:28.850 --> 05:32.680
Grampy told me that story,
but he said youfarted.

05:32.810 --> 05:35.683
The point is,
it was a good day.

05:35.813 --> 05:38.033
What's the best day
you've ever had?

05:38.163 --> 05:39.513
Oh, that's easy.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.297
The day you were born.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.821
You got to say that.It's true.

05:43.952 --> 05:48.130
And it's gonna stay true until
the Browns win the Super Bowl.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.437
Keep waiting.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.395
[rustling in brush]

05:52.526 --> 05:53.788
Is that a rabbit?

05:53.918 --> 05:56.617
Yes, it is. Bugs Bunny
at three o'clock.

05:56.747 --> 05:59.533
Dad, we talked
about naming them.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.275
Good. Find your
anchor points.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.407
Hover the pin.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.757
Let that shot
surprise you.

06:08.933 --> 06:12.763
It's okay. Whenever you're
ready. There's no rush.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.984
I mean, we do have
a clean shot.

06:16.724 --> 06:19.988
That's the first animal
we've seen in four hours.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.948
I can't.No, sure you can.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.864
Take a deep breath,
and aim for that heart.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.390
But he's so cute.Uh, I...

06:30.520 --> 06:32.261
I know, baby,
but this is food.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.090
Everyone who eats meat ought
to know where it comes from.

06:35.220 --> 06:38.615
Okay, I will if I have to.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.575
Well, you don't have
to do anything.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.577
But if you're
gonna be a Marine,

06:43.707 --> 06:45.361
you might have to
shoot something.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.407
Not animals.Yeah, animals.

06:47.537 --> 06:50.105
You got to catch and kill a
rabbit in survival training.

06:50.235 --> 06:51.933
What? Why?For food.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.196
Their eyeballs are
packed with nutrients.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.807
Like giant vitamins
that pop in your mouth.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.287
Well, can't I just take
real vitamins?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.984
They sell 'em everywhere.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.470
So, Dirk?Yeah.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.037
How long have you known Ariana?

07:09.167 --> 07:10.168
A while.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.301
Oh, only a while. Huh.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.042
So, you haven't met the family?

07:14.172 --> 07:16.174
I have now.
You're her brother, right?

07:16.305 --> 07:19.787
[laughs]
No, no. Actually,
we were a kind of a thing.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.615
Huh, she's never
mentioned you.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.312
Well, she's never
mentioned you, either.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.228
Ariana Jaan, I saved you a bike.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.709
You don't mind, do you?
Thank you, sir. Okay, bye.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.495
Thank you.Yeah.

07:32.626 --> 07:35.498
All right, everybody,
clip in and let's go.

07:35.629 --> 07:38.022
[upbeat
instrumental music plays]

07:43.332 --> 07:45.334
[whispers loudly]:
Help me.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.076
There's a thing on the bottom
of your shoe that you snap into.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.863
Got it.Thank you so much
for helping me, Al.

07:52.994 --> 07:56.737
Oh, Lizzie,
I am all about the helping.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.307
That was fantastic.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.309
It was.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.746
You ready to go again?

08:05.876 --> 08:08.009
You kidding?Yeah, of course,
I'm kidding.

08:08.139 --> 08:10.402
You could turn around
the USS Nimitz

08:10.533 --> 08:12.361
faster than I could go again.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.276
[laughs]

08:14.406 --> 08:16.278
Ah. What do we do now?

08:16.408 --> 08:18.454
Up to you.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.196
I already got
what I wanted.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.025
Well, I can
make us a snack.

08:24.155 --> 08:26.723
Which is best
followed by a nap.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.812
You're invited to both.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.989
What do you do for fun
when the kids aren't around?

08:32.120 --> 08:34.514
I just told you--
nap and eat.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.211
Come on.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.605
Well, there is something.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.998
It's kind of my thing.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.827
Well, maybe
it could be our thing.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.526
Well, technically,
it's illegal,

08:46.656 --> 08:49.703
but I do it for the
good of the city.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.922
Are you Batman?

08:52.053 --> 08:54.229
Batman?

08:55.360 --> 08:57.232
Kind of.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.277
[giggles]

09:02.454 --> 09:03.673
I'm really sorry.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.066
It's no big deal.

09:05.196 --> 09:06.154
I let you down.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.373
No. No, this is on me.

09:08.504 --> 09:09.984
We started too cute.

09:10.114 --> 09:13.335
We should've gone down to
the water and shot some ducks.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.250
I don't want to shoot a duck.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.948
Okay. It'll be faster

09:18.079 --> 09:20.342
if you just tell me
what you dowant to shoot.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.300
I don't want to shoot anything!

09:22.431 --> 09:24.259
That's okay.No, it's not.

09:24.389 --> 09:25.956
How am I gonna be
a Marine?

09:26.087 --> 09:30.091
You're young. You'll feel
different when you're older.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.180
What if I can't eat
a rabbit's eyeball?

09:32.310 --> 09:35.966
It's not bad. It's like a
little grape full of blood.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.883
I told everyone I know
I'm gonna be a Marine.

09:40.014 --> 09:43.539
I'm gonna let down you
and Grampy and my country.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.976
And the Constitution.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.328
So... maybe you'll
do something else.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.592
Like what? I haven't been
paying attention in school

09:52.722 --> 09:53.941
since we did shapes.

09:54.071 --> 09:57.118
Ask me the capital
of anywhere, I have no idea!

10:04.604 --> 10:06.083
Keep it up!

10:06.214 --> 10:08.782
Breathe it!
Breathe it!

10:08.912 --> 10:10.479
This is great.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.612
It's nice to be on a bicycle
without being distracted

10:12.742 --> 10:14.439
by beautiful scenery

10:14.570 --> 10:16.006
or the cool wind
in your face.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.442
[laughs]

10:17.573 --> 10:19.140
[whimpering]

10:19.270 --> 10:20.315
Are you crying?

10:20.445 --> 10:21.621
I have a leg cramp.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.318
It hurts so bad!

10:24.058 --> 10:25.581
Okay, ten minute break.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.583
Oh... already?

10:27.714 --> 10:28.628
Ah.

10:28.758 --> 10:29.672
Oh, man.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.239
I am so tight.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.501
Ah, let me help
you with that.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.981
Thanks.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.070
Ooh, you must be
a Boy Scout,

10:36.200 --> 10:37.898
because you have
so many knots.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.508
[laughs]

10:39.639 --> 10:41.292
Where is the joke?

10:41.423 --> 10:43.251
Tell me where the joke is.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.475
What are we trying
to find?

10:50.606 --> 10:53.174
Wrongs that
need righting.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.045
Fine.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.568
Don't tell me.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.701
Promise you
won't laugh?

10:59.702 --> 11:01.312
No.

11:02.618 --> 11:03.837
Graffiti.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.448
I paint over graffiti.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.015
Really?

11:08.145 --> 11:10.408
Yeah, it's a
serious problem.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.628
I mean, when someone gets
robbed, there's one victim.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.544
With graffiti... the
whole community suffers.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.678
It really burns my biscuits.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.681
When did this start?

11:21.811 --> 11:23.552
Ah, it's a long story.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.641
Tell me.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.599
Well, my wife
was a realtor.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.559
She studied hard,
got her license.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.432
It was a proud day when
she got her first bus bench.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.565
And a week later...

11:37.697 --> 11:39.742
...I can't even tell ya
what they did to her picture.

11:39.873 --> 11:42.136
Cops said, "Let it go," but...

11:42.266 --> 11:44.268
I couldn't.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.839
That's surprisingly sexy.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.886
Not now, Lois,
we got a job to do.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.633
You know, I didn't even
want to be a Marine

12:01.764 --> 12:03.635
when I was your age.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.073
I was gonna be
a stuntman.

12:06.203 --> 12:09.076
I was really good
at jumping off roofs.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.644
Once I jumped off the gym
and landed on the principal.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.125
Broke her collarbone.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.476
Stop trying
to make me feel better.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.435
Sorry.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.875
I just wanted us
to do something cool together.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.227
Don't worry about it.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.631
I'm gonna teach you
how to drive a car.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.720
Now we're talking!

12:44.851 --> 12:47.157
â™ª

12:48.071 --> 12:49.769
Great work everybody!
Let's hear it!

12:49.899 --> 12:51.814
[whoops]

12:51.945 --> 12:54.251
I thought everyone
was gonna do it.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.776
Keep going!
Keep going!

12:56.906 --> 12:59.169
You, maybe stop.
You don't look so hot.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.477
What?No shame. Let's give this guy
a round of applause.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.522
No, no-- don't applaud.

13:04.653 --> 13:07.090
You can applaud at the end
when I win.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.831
Awalmir, this isn't a contest.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.050
You did great.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.660
And I am not done.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.270
I love this little guy.
He's got so much heart.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.359
We are literally the same size.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.753
Let's crank it up![all whooping]

13:17.884 --> 13:20.060
Oh, now we're screaming?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.499
Okay, hands
at ten and two.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.675
Keep your eyes on the road.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.285
Easy on the brake.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.026
Easy on the gas.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.376
Wow.

13:32.507 --> 13:33.813
Impressive.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.859
I guess all those years
of Mario Kartreally paid off.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.818
And Grand Theft Auto.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.820
Okay, now turn the wheel

13:40.950 --> 13:42.517
sort of back and forth.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.824
Why?
Fun.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.479
[whoops, laughing]
[laughing]

13:50.612 --> 13:52.179
This is great!

13:52.309 --> 13:53.963
You'll never forget the day

13:54.094 --> 13:56.357
your dad taught you
how to drive.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.882
[siren chirping]

14:01.144 --> 14:02.624
[siren wailing]

14:02.754 --> 14:04.669
Should I speed up?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.976
[siren wails, chirps]

14:08.543 --> 14:11.024
Son of a gun.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.374
This is what I get
for taking a weekend off.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.855
What's "Fishstick?"

14:15.985 --> 14:17.813
It's a who.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.250
Okay, who's Fishstick?

14:20.381 --> 14:21.861
My nemesis.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.167
Been scrawling his dumb name
all over town.

14:24.298 --> 14:27.388
So, what, you drive around
at night, painting over it?

14:27.518 --> 14:29.042
Somebody's got to.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.566
Do they?

14:31.696 --> 14:33.220
Okay, here's the deal.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.744
The city works
with three garbage contractors.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.050
Each one uses

14:37.180 --> 14:38.834
a different color green
on their dumpsters.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.054
You got your fern,
your forest...

14:41.184 --> 14:43.795
and your light fern,
but don't worry.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.580
I got all three.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.060
Wasn't worried.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.365
Well, you should be.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.237
If you don't match the color,

14:50.367 --> 14:52.892
you're no better than Fishstick.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.377
Okay, let me do
the talking.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.729
What seems to be
the problem, Officer?

15:04.860 --> 15:07.210
License and
registration.

15:07.341 --> 15:10.126
I have a library card.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.955
Okay, what's
going on here?

15:13.086 --> 15:14.914
I'm just teaching her
to drive.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.046
It's a long story--
we had a bad day hunting.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.701
So you just thought you'd
kill something out here?

15:21.007 --> 15:22.399
Look, man,
can you cut me a break?

15:22.530 --> 15:23.966
It's not like
we're on the road.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.576
How old is she?

15:25.707 --> 15:27.970
How old do you think I am?

15:28.101 --> 15:30.581
That's not how
this works.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.933
Sir, you're coming
with me to the station.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.633
So should I follow you guys
or what?

15:40.983 --> 15:43.551
[panting]
I know I have legs

15:43.681 --> 15:45.683
'cause I can see them.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.990
But I cannot feel them.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.731
ARIANA:
Guys...

15:49.861 --> 15:51.994
I hate to say it...

15:52.125 --> 15:53.648
Please say it.What?

15:53.778 --> 15:54.866
I'm out.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.173
I'm out, too!

16:00.002 --> 16:01.482
Dude!

16:01.612 --> 16:03.919
What are you doing? Go get
some face time with Ariana.

16:04.050 --> 16:04.920
I can't.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.226
Why?

16:07.618 --> 16:09.577
You know why.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.145
You're looking tired, man.

16:12.275 --> 16:15.148
I was born tired.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.672
So just to be clear,

16:17.802 --> 16:20.457
the woman you're interested
in is over there by herself,

16:20.588 --> 16:22.329
and you're here
being an idiot?

16:22.459 --> 16:25.245
It's called the long game.

16:26.289 --> 16:29.205
Unless I die.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.513
Huh?
[exhales]

16:32.643 --> 16:35.298
You know, I have this theory
that, uh, Fishstick is

16:35.429 --> 16:38.171
actually two people
working together.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.173
It would explain how he, uh,
tagged the stop sign

16:40.303 --> 16:42.523
on 5th and the wall
behind Dress Mart

16:42.653 --> 16:44.873
on the same night.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.701
I don't know
if it's the exhilaration

16:46.831 --> 16:48.311
of doing something illegal

16:48.442 --> 16:50.487
or breathing in
all these fumes, but...

16:50.618 --> 16:52.359
I feel alive.

16:53.447 --> 16:54.883
That's how it starts.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.798
Next thing you know,
you're painting a water tower

16:56.928 --> 16:57.929
in the middle of January.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.453
"A water tower"?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.803
Where Fishstick goes, I go.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.807
Want to hear something crazy?What?

17:05.937 --> 17:08.201
This is kind of turning me on.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.208
Well, let's head home.

17:15.338 --> 17:18.689
I think the Nimitzis ready
for a port call.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.691
Let's go.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.911
I was gonna save...

17:23.042 --> 17:25.218
Uh, all right.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.224
Who bailed me out?Your wife.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.531
Any chance you could lock me
back up?

17:41.364 --> 17:43.062
Where's Hazel?

17:43.192 --> 17:44.498
Car.
Oh, no.

17:44.628 --> 17:47.283
I have the keys.
Cool, okay.

17:49.459 --> 17:52.071
You mad?

17:53.115 --> 17:55.030
Actually...

17:55.161 --> 17:57.163
I'm more sorry.

17:57.989 --> 18:00.035
About what?

18:00.949 --> 18:03.343
Freddy teaching Hazel
how to ride a bike.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.258
Does my sister
tell you everything

18:05.388 --> 18:06.955
that goes on
in that house?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.957
Pretty much.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.612
Look, you got
to understand.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.268
Hazel wanted to learn
and I was so busy

18:15.398 --> 18:17.574
and Freddy offered...

18:18.749 --> 18:21.100
I didn't even think about
it until she came back

18:21.230 --> 18:23.058
so excited.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.799
And then it hit me.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.281
That's a memory
you don't get.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.633
I'm sorry.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.637
Thank you.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.031
Come on, um,

18:40.162 --> 18:42.121
let's go get your truck.Yeah.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.167
Oh, and, uh...

18:45.298 --> 18:47.387
Hazel says she's
a vegetarian now.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.650
Yeah, that one's my fault.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.347
[chuckles]

18:58.702 --> 19:00.095
We're gonna get
something to eat.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.183
You guys want to come?

19:01.314 --> 19:03.664
I'll quit when he quits.

19:03.794 --> 19:04.969
I don't know the word "quit."

19:05.100 --> 19:06.188
Why don't you get off your bike

19:06.319 --> 19:07.407
and go look it up?

19:07.537 --> 19:08.843
All right, that's enough.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.193
On the count of three,
you both stop.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.195
One, two...

19:13.326 --> 19:14.762
three!

19:17.330 --> 19:19.941
Okay, bye.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.986
Al, I'm taking the car.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.206
Fine, I'll walk home.

19:24.337 --> 19:27.122
I have nothing but...

19:27.253 --> 19:29.603
[inhales deeply]
...energy.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.518
[panting] Huh?
