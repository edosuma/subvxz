WEBVTT

00:07.092 --> 00:09.552
This guy messaged me on OkCupid.

00:09.719 --> 00:11.596
Didn't this used
to be a Blockbuster?

00:11.763 --> 00:14.557
Can't we just go as the Golden Ghouls
again? I still got the blouses.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.434
No, I am not spending another
Halloween dressed as an old,

00:16.601 --> 00:18.478
dead woman from
an '80s TV show.

00:18.645 --> 00:20.939
We're throwing a party this year.
We're gonna be the fun gays.

00:21.106 --> 00:22.649
- I'm already a fun gay.
- You're literally the least

00:22.816 --> 00:24.484
fun gay I know.

00:24.651 --> 00:26.778
What's not fun and gay
about being a Golden Ghoul?

00:26.945 --> 00:29.614
Shouldn't you and Eddie be doing
a couple's costume by now anyway?

00:29.781 --> 00:31.700
What, and be like Dom and Doris,
San Francisco's most

00:31.866 --> 00:33.618
annoying Halloween couple?

00:33.785 --> 00:35.620
- Hey.
- Hey, how about a hairy fairy?

00:35.787 --> 00:37.622
Oh, man, I hate you.

00:37.789 --> 00:39.332
- I love it.
- You look good in wings.

00:39.499 --> 00:40.959
- You think so?
- Yeah.

00:41.126 --> 00:42.961
Amazing. Your hair
and that glitter.

00:43.128 --> 00:44.963
All right, we're in.

00:45.130 --> 00:47.465
Oh, Good. Yeah. See, glitter,
that's all I needed to hear.

00:47.632 --> 00:49.926
Just, glitter does it.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.469
The Facebook invite says 9:00,

00:51.553 --> 00:53.263
which means people probably
are gonna show up around 10:00,

00:53.430 --> 00:54.639
so I think we should
have the keg by 8:30.

00:54.806 --> 00:56.307
- It'll be there.
- Hey, I gotta go.

00:56.474 --> 00:58.184
- Where are you going?
- Gotta get to work.

00:58.351 --> 01:00.645
- It's Saturday.
- Homeless gay kids don't stop

01:00.812 --> 01:02.021
being homeless
on the weekend, Paddy.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.648
But you're supposed
to get the cups and plates.

01:03.815 --> 01:05.734
Well, can't you do it?
I promised Eddie I'd help out

01:05.900 --> 01:07.569
- with the pumpkins.
- No, I have to go to the office

01:07.736 --> 01:09.779
- to get the <i>Monster Mash</i> remix.
- The what?

01:09.946 --> 01:11.364
- The karaoke remix of--
- I'm already late.

01:11.531 --> 01:13.450
I gotta go or else I'll be late. Bye.

01:13.950 --> 01:16.077
How is it that the new,
thoughtful AgustÃ­n

01:16.244 --> 01:17.829
still leaves me
with everything to do?

01:17.996 --> 01:19.664
- He's doing his best.
- I guess so.

01:19.831 --> 01:21.499
His best just
isn't that great.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.835
- That's true. Right?
- Yes.

01:53.615 --> 01:55.533
Hey.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.620
- Oh, Jesus.
- Sorry.

01:58.787 --> 02:00.330
You scared
the shit out of me.

02:00.497 --> 02:02.999
Well, it is Halloween.
What are you playing?

02:03.166 --> 02:06.294
Oh, just something I've already
beaten about 15 times,

02:06.461 --> 02:08.296
I just haven't gotten
the perfect score yet.

02:08.463 --> 02:11.716
Here I am thinking you're shaming me
by working on the weekend.

02:11.883 --> 02:13.802
Well, I sort of did some work.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.638
I coded some of that app
we were talking about.

02:16.805 --> 02:19.516
Seriously?
The gay battle game?

02:19.682 --> 02:21.810
- I didn't know that you were still--
- No...

02:21.976 --> 02:23.478
I was just bored, I guess.

02:23.645 --> 02:25.980
Inventing work for myself.

02:27.190 --> 02:30.276
Anyway, what are
you doing here?

02:30.443 --> 02:32.028
Haven't you got
a party to prepare?

02:32.821 --> 02:35.365
- That's what I'm doing.
- By stealing from the office?

02:35.532 --> 02:38.827
Just a few Twix.

02:38.993 --> 02:42.038
- You, uh, you got the evite, right?
- I did.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.541
Cool. You don't have to come if you
don't want to. I totally get it.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.292
- Do you not want me to come?
- No.

02:46.459 --> 02:48.962
No, I just-- I...
I didn't want you to...

02:49.128 --> 02:51.840
think that I was having a party
and purposely not inviting you.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.300
I appreciate the gesture, Patrick,
but seeing as it might be

02:54.467 --> 02:56.678
my only Halloween
in San Francisco,

02:56.845 --> 02:58.930
I feel like Jon and I may
opt to see the sights.

02:59.097 --> 03:00.640
What does that mean?

03:02.433 --> 03:05.311
We talked about going
back to Seattle.

03:05.478 --> 03:07.522
- What?
- Mm. Be good for us, I think.

03:07.689 --> 03:09.440
Jon misses his family,

03:09.607 --> 03:11.693
and I feel like I made him
leave a job he really liked.

03:11.860 --> 03:14.654
- I guess I get that, but...
- But what?

03:14.821 --> 03:18.825
You basically
just got here, right?

03:18.992 --> 03:21.870
It'd be better for us.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.290
For me.

03:29.752 --> 03:31.504
Well, this city
is really fun on Halloween,

03:31.671 --> 03:34.257
but it can also be
kind of nuts, so...

03:34.841 --> 03:35.967
...be safe.

03:36.092 --> 03:37.176
- I will.
- Happy Halloween.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.386
Yeah, yeah. You too.

03:45.435 --> 03:48.563
Last year, Dustin wrote "Anal Rape
Pumpkin." So this is progress.

03:48.730 --> 03:51.941
- It was a political statement.
- Who did that one?

03:52.108 --> 03:54.611
- That's mine.
- It's very Banksy.

03:54.777 --> 03:56.237
No fuckin' way
you did that.

03:56.404 --> 03:59.198
- Uh, yeah, I did.
- Thanks for believing in us.

03:59.365 --> 04:00.992
I only believe
in three things:

04:01.159 --> 04:03.912
it's RuPaul, Hillary Clinton,
and you kids. So relax.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.956
- You guys have no taste.
- Hey, don't be rude,

04:07.123 --> 04:10.376
or you're not gonna get one of these
delicious IHOP gift certificates.

04:10.543 --> 04:13.755
- Pancakes suck, Mr. Eddie.
- Wait, what, pancakes suck?

04:13.922 --> 04:16.841
Only in America can a homeless
kid complain about free pancakes.

04:17.008 --> 04:18.927
Look, this is from a grant,
so get yourself

04:19.093 --> 04:21.888
a spooky lumberjack stack.
It's Halloween!

04:22.055 --> 04:23.640
Hey. You dressing up tonight?

04:23.806 --> 04:25.433
Does a bottom howl
at the moon?

04:25.600 --> 04:28.311
- I don't know what that means.
- Sure you don't.

04:28.478 --> 04:31.940
You should spend the night.
After the party.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.733
You mean, like,
in the bed with you?

04:33.900 --> 04:37.570
Like, yes, in the bed with me.
Clothing optional.

04:37.737 --> 04:41.824
Yeah... I told some friends I'd meet
them at The EndUp after your party.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.159
Oh.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.244
But depending on your
Halloween costume,

04:45.411 --> 04:47.163
- perhaps I could be persuaded.
- Oh...

04:47.330 --> 04:49.749
- is that a challenge?
- You tell me.

04:49.916 --> 04:52.210
Ooh...

04:52.377 --> 04:54.295
Okay. All right.
I'm coming for you.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.381
- Yeah, what you got, boy?
- Oh, I got it.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.508
I know exactly what I'm bringing.
You're gonna love it.

04:58.675 --> 05:00.843
- All right, I'm waiting.
- You're spending the night.

05:01.010 --> 05:02.512
You might even
spend many nights.

05:02.679 --> 05:04.681
All right, slow your roll.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.350
Hey, can you take
a look at this for me?

05:07.517 --> 05:09.394
If this involves curating
your naked selfies,

05:09.560 --> 05:11.604
I already told you I think it's
weird if you show your butthole.

05:11.771 --> 05:13.398
It's not naked selfies. Look.

05:13.564 --> 05:16.109
- You're tweeting.
- It's good for the Kickstarter.

05:16.275 --> 05:19.195
@ChickenDom40. All right,
you have 30 followers.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.364
That's not much of an
expansion, my friend. Sorry.

05:21.531 --> 05:22.907
Oh, you're a beacon
of positivity. Thank you.

05:23.116 --> 05:24.367
Okay, no.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. No.

05:24.534 --> 05:26.786
I'm glad you're sticking with it.
That's good.

05:26.953 --> 05:29.288
You also realize you're asking for
Twitter help from the woman who just

05:29.455 --> 05:31.249
found out last week that my
phone has a calendar on it.

05:31.416 --> 05:32.875
- Congratulations.
- So helpful. Why don't you ask

05:33.042 --> 05:35.336
one of Patrick's techie friends
to help you tonight?

05:35.503 --> 05:37.505
Oh, you mean, like, "Hey, come
help Grandpa use the clicker?"

05:37.672 --> 05:40.967
Yeah, exactly. It's the least they
could do for ruining the city.

05:41.134 --> 05:42.719
You know,
speaking of tonight...

05:42.885 --> 05:44.929
I know we said we'd never do it,
but then I saw this,

05:45.096 --> 05:47.140
and I was like, "Fuck it,
we are doing it this year."

05:47.306 --> 05:50.768
Oh, my God! No!
That's not She-Ra's headdress. No!

05:50.935 --> 05:53.187
Oh, and wait one moment.
That's not all.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.606
- Right next to it, we have...
- Oh, man!

05:55.773 --> 05:59.318
Right? And you are gonna flip
when you see my wig.

06:00.737 --> 06:02.488
- Shit.
- What?

06:02.655 --> 06:06.200
I told Malik that
I would dress up with him.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.911
We were drunk
and I kinda promised.

06:09.078 --> 06:10.997
Oh.

06:11.164 --> 06:14.333
No, it's fine.
I mean, you're a couple now.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.836
You should wear
a couple's costume.

06:17.003 --> 06:18.838
All right, I see what you're doing.
I see what you're doing.

06:19.005 --> 06:20.381
What is it with gay people
trying to ruin

06:20.548 --> 06:22.675
straight people's
relationships with their labels?

06:22.842 --> 06:25.845
We are two adults who
occasionally sleep together,

06:26.012 --> 06:30.266
and we're going to a party dressed
as romantically involved partners.

06:30.433 --> 06:33.478
- That's all. That's all.
- Got it. Got it.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.188
But now
I wanna see the wig.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.481
- Really?
- Yes.

06:36.647 --> 06:37.690
- You really do?
- You got me.

06:37.857 --> 06:40.401
Oh, my God.
You're gonna be so jealous

06:40.568 --> 06:42.070
that you're not coming with me,

06:42.236 --> 06:46.282
- because this is kind of awesome.
- Oh, no. Okay.

06:46.449 --> 06:49.702
Ew. Oh, God, you look like
a mentally ill Barbie doll,

06:49.869 --> 06:51.329
after I cut off
my Barbie doll's hair.

06:51.496 --> 06:53.539
- Really? Was she still pretty?
- No, 'cause I also burned

06:53.706 --> 06:57.043
her nose down. Nose job.

06:59.045 --> 07:01.255
Hey. I'm almost done.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.882
Hey, will you Velcro
me in the back, please?

07:03.049 --> 07:05.093
- Okay. Yeah.
- Thank you.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.886
- Oh, drinks, thank you.
- Yeah.

07:07.053 --> 07:09.430
- How good is this costume?
- Yeah.

07:09.597 --> 07:12.558
- What're you supposed to be?
- I'm Gordon Freeman.

07:12.725 --> 07:15.394
And he's, like, what,
a mailman from the future?

07:15.561 --> 07:18.564
No, he's one of the most popular
video game characters of all time.

07:18.731 --> 07:20.983
He revolutionized first-person
shooter games because you

07:21.150 --> 07:23.945
so rarely saw or heard him, you could
better imagine yourself in the game.

07:24.112 --> 07:26.322
Wait, so, your idea
of a fun gay is a character

07:26.489 --> 07:28.741
with so little personality
he's basically nothing?

07:28.908 --> 07:32.161
No, my idea of being a fun gay
is to have an amazing costume,

07:32.328 --> 07:34.413
to forget everything that
Kevin told me earlier today...

07:34.580 --> 07:36.374
- Oh, fuck that guy.
- ...and to throw an amazing party,

07:36.541 --> 07:39.127
all right? Tonight, I'm gonna be
hashtag "instagayed,"

07:39.293 --> 07:41.629
and people are gonna be like,
"Wow, who is that really cute,

07:41.796 --> 07:44.715
well-adjusted, single guy?"
It's me, America. Get into it.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.093
Or people will be like,
"Oh, my God.

07:47.260 --> 07:48.719
"I can't believe
that mailman from the future

07:48.886 --> 07:51.222
didn't drop off that package
I haven't ordered yet."

07:51.389 --> 07:53.099
Okay, I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

07:53.266 --> 07:54.809
Okay, here we go.

07:54.976 --> 07:56.686
- To Morgan Freeman.
- It...

07:56.853 --> 07:59.272
- To Gordon Freeman.
- Thank you. Gordon Freeman.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.524
- Gordon Freeman.
- Gordon-- If people ask,

08:01.691 --> 08:03.401
- Gordon--
- If people ask?

08:03.568 --> 08:05.403
- Yeah, people will ask.
- People are gonna know.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.113
People are gonna ask.

08:15.163 --> 08:16.873
Hey, Mr. Fung is cool
with the music, right?

08:17.039 --> 08:18.875
- Sometimes Fung freaks out.
- Fung'll be fine,

08:19.041 --> 08:21.460
though I'm not so sure
about everyone else.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.088
What is this playlist,
"Now Music 5"?

08:24.255 --> 08:26.924
No, it's my special party playlist,
and if you touch it I'll kill you.

08:27.091 --> 08:31.387
Oh, my God, you're Maleficent.
That is such a good costume.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.598
You look amazing.

08:33.764 --> 08:34.932
Keg!

08:35.099 --> 08:37.059
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

08:37.226 --> 08:39.937
Master of my universe!

08:40.104 --> 08:41.814
He-Man! Wow.

08:41.981 --> 08:44.275
What fabulous secret powers
are you going to reveal tonight

08:44.442 --> 08:46.068
when you hold aloft
your magic sword?

08:46.235 --> 08:48.321
Wouldn't you like to know?
And you are?

08:48.487 --> 08:50.448
- I'm Gordon Freeman.
- Okay.

08:50.615 --> 08:51.991
Ta-da!

08:52.158 --> 08:54.619
He's one of the most popular
video game characters of all time.

08:54.744 --> 08:56.287
- He revolutionized--
- You don't want to hear

08:56.454 --> 08:57.788
- the explanation.
- Where do you guys want this?

08:57.872 --> 08:59.207
It weighs like
a million fucking pounds.

08:59.290 --> 09:01.209
- In the kitchen.
- In the kitchen. Yeah, yeah.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.211
And also, promise
you're gonna do karaoke later, okay?

09:03.377 --> 09:04.921
- Oh, God, do I have to?
- Yes, yes!

09:05.087 --> 09:06.297
- You have to sign up.
- We all do.

09:06.464 --> 09:08.090
Actually, everyone,
there's gonna be karaoke later.

09:08.257 --> 09:11.385
So there's a sheet.
There's a sign-up sheet in there.

09:16.057 --> 09:19.143
Hey, uh, I gave your Kickstarter,
like, 35 bucks.

09:19.310 --> 09:22.563
That means I get some sort
of coupon for nuggets, right?

09:22.730 --> 09:24.148
Hey, you're
a social media guy, right?

09:24.315 --> 09:28.319
Yeah. Am I a social media guy?
I have 3,300 Tumblr followers.

09:28.486 --> 09:31.030
- Isn't that just for porn?
- No, what--? It's not...

09:31.197 --> 09:32.823
It's not not for porn.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.743
But it's... do you not know
what a Tumblr is?

09:37.453 --> 09:40.623
No way.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.792
- That is crazy!
- Come on.

09:42.959 --> 09:44.710
- You guys are, uh...
- Come on.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.254
- You're, uh...
- Come on.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.172
- Oh, my God, you don't know?
- Yes, yes. No, I...

09:48.339 --> 09:53.261
Come on. Ooh!

09:53.427 --> 09:55.263
We're like pigeons.
We're like singing pigeons.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.431
We're not singing pigeons.
We're Sonny and Cher!

09:57.598 --> 09:59.725
Oh, yes! Yes!
Sonny and Cher!

09:59.892 --> 10:01.769
Oh, my God, you guys
are the cutest.

10:01.936 --> 10:03.771
See, babe? Patrick
says we're the cutest.

10:03.896 --> 10:04.981
The cutest.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.857
Yeah, you're gonna believe that
from the gay Walter White?

10:07.024 --> 10:09.694
- Or Tron, or whatever you are.
- No, it's Gordon Freeman.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.654
I don't know what it's gonna
take to convince this woman

10:11.821 --> 10:13.739
that she's in love with me.

10:13.906 --> 10:16.033
- That is so intense.
- Yeah, that's a little intense.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.203
You know what's less intense?
Sonny and Cher karaoke duet.

10:19.370 --> 10:20.413
- Oh!
- Right?

10:20.579 --> 10:22.248
Inside, I got
a karaoke machine!

10:22.415 --> 10:24.375
- Karaoke!
- That sounds awful.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.002
- I need shots.
- Go in and get a drink,

10:26.168 --> 10:28.546
and then sign up, though.
I'm trying to avoid party conflict

10:28.713 --> 10:30.172
with people fighting
over who goes next.

10:30.339 --> 10:33.217
Ding-dong!

10:33.384 --> 10:34.760
- Oh!
- Love you, Cher.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.679
- Love you, He-Man.
- Look at that ass!

10:36.846 --> 10:41.767
Hey, what do you think of
Dom'sJuicyChicken.Tumblr.com?

10:41.934 --> 10:43.686
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

10:43.853 --> 10:46.772
My God, I spent 200 dollars on that
karaoke machine and no one's singing.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.232
- What?
- The karaoke machine.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.109
I thought it would be,
you know, a good party thing.

10:50.276 --> 10:52.236
- Seriously?
- I want people to have fun.

10:52.403 --> 10:54.113
People are having fun.
You're not having fun.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.406
No, I am having
plenty of fun.

10:55.531 --> 10:58.200
Okay, Clarissa Dalloway.
Lay off on the booze, okay?

10:58.367 --> 11:00.953
- You smell like my <i>tÃ­a</i> Stella.
- Who's Clarissa Dalloway?

11:01.120 --> 11:03.914
- Well, who's <i>tÃ­a</i> Stella?
- One person. One person on this list.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.709
- Oh, my goodness!
- Huh?

11:06.876 --> 11:08.878
- Right? Cutie.
Girl, what you supposed to be?

11:09.045 --> 11:10.629
- The chlamydia fairy?
- What?

11:10.796 --> 11:12.340
Are you Hagrid
from <i>Harry Potter</i>?

11:12.506 --> 11:15.009
- Bilbo Baggins, motherfucker.
- Shit. You look good.

11:15.176 --> 11:17.053
- Thanks. So do you.
- Thank you.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.263
Uh, Patrick, this is James.
James, Patrick.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.349
- Hi.
- James thinks you're adorable,

11:21.515 --> 11:23.225
and you're both single.
So you guys should discuss this

11:23.351 --> 11:25.478
- while we go get drinks.
- Okay. All right.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.730
- Oh, wow. Okay.
- Well you just-- Drinks are that way.

11:27.897 --> 11:31.692
- Bilbo Faggins, looking cute!
- Sorry about that. Eddie's a lot.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.652
Yeah. You're, uh,
you're, uh...

11:33.819 --> 11:35.446
Link from <i>Legend of Zelda,</i>
right?

11:35.613 --> 11:37.198
- Uh, Legolas.
- Mm.

11:37.365 --> 11:39.617
We had this whole
"Lord of the Cock-rings" thing going,

11:39.784 --> 11:42.161
- but everyone got lost and...
- So like the movie?

11:42.328 --> 11:45.456
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Oh. Will you excuse me for a second?

11:45.623 --> 11:47.416
- Sure.
- Hey!

11:47.583 --> 11:49.835
- Hey.
- Yes! This is the best

11:50.002 --> 11:52.630
Gordon Freeman costume
I've ever seen!

11:52.797 --> 11:54.882
- Thanks.
- You... you made this?

11:55.049 --> 11:58.803
- Uh, most of it, yeah. Uh...
- Hey! Guess who I am?

11:58.969 --> 12:01.013
Um, shot in the dark,
I'm gonna say Carrie.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.848
See, bitch?

12:03.015 --> 12:05.059
I told her people would
think she's an angry tampon,

12:05.226 --> 12:06.769
- and I stand by that.
- Wow.

12:06.936 --> 12:09.021
I'm gonna make us drinks.
Do you like whiskey?

12:09.188 --> 12:11.732
- I like whiskey.
- I know you like whiskey.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.901
- Yes, I do.
- You like anything.

12:14.068 --> 12:16.862
- BRB!
- Okay.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.781
- Wow.
- They're a little intense

12:18.948 --> 12:21.283
- when they get together.
- Yeah, he's got a lot of energy.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.495
- Be nice.
- What?

12:24.662 --> 12:26.747
He's all revved up.
His article just went

12:26.914 --> 12:28.749
- viral this week, so...
- Oh, that's exciting.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.293
Yeah, he's the youngest writer
at <i>SF Weekly</i> to get that many views.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.380
Wow, that's a real...
that's a real accomplishment.

12:34.547 --> 12:37.425
I'm serious, I'm serious.
I'm really-- I'm happy that you came,

12:37.591 --> 12:39.385
and I'm happy
that you brought Brady.

12:39.552 --> 12:42.179
- Thanks. He's a lot of fun.
- Yeah, definitely.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.890
I mean, he's not
as much fun as me, but...

12:45.057 --> 12:48.477
He's way more fun than you.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.105
- Wait, seriously? I thought...
- Who's thirsty?

12:51.272 --> 12:53.399
Okay, thank you!

12:53.566 --> 12:55.860
- All right. Cheers.
- Cheers.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.362
Cheers!

12:58.529 --> 13:00.781
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.909
Fuck! You two are so cute.

13:04.076 --> 13:07.580
I'm serious, you guys are
like "put a ring on it" cute.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.957
- Hold on, hold on. Hold this?
- Okay.

13:10.124 --> 13:13.252
- Oh, my God.
- All right, do some sweet shit.

13:13.419 --> 13:16.755
Come on. Yeah.
Make it real cute, real cute.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.924
- Okay, last one, last one.
- Okay. All right.

13:19.091 --> 13:23.179
- Okay.
- All right. One more. Selfie, selfie.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.847
So basically I just make sure

13:25.014 --> 13:27.099
the applicants have their paperwork
in order. It's not a lot of fun,

13:27.266 --> 13:29.310
- but it pays pretty well.
- Mm.

13:29.477 --> 13:32.188
- I heard you--
- Listen, I gotta go, um...

13:32.354 --> 13:35.191
check on the chips.
I'll see you.

13:35.274 --> 13:36.984
I thought it was really
important to push for,

13:37.151 --> 13:40.070
because it's a kind of homophobia
that's hard to clock,

13:40.237 --> 13:42.031
but it's sex shame.

13:42.198 --> 13:44.158
If there's a pill
that can prevent HIV,

13:44.325 --> 13:45.576
everyone should take it.

13:45.743 --> 13:47.328
Believe me, I would've
been the first in line.

13:47.495 --> 13:49.955
Yeah, but taking a pill
just so you can fuck? I mean...

13:50.122 --> 13:52.291
Yeah, it's like
birth control, actually.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.043
It's not really the same.

13:54.210 --> 13:56.754
In the same way that
birth control liberates women,

13:56.921 --> 13:59.548
- PrEP can liberate gay men.
- Yeah.

13:59.715 --> 14:03.469
How does having unprotected sex
liberate anyone?

14:03.636 --> 14:06.013
Right? I mean, what's so bad
about using condoms?

14:06.180 --> 14:10.643
Well, you're actually supposed to
continue using condoms while on PrEP.

14:12.603 --> 14:14.355
Okay, but the thing
about using condoms

14:14.522 --> 14:16.357
is the only reason
people use condoms

14:16.524 --> 14:18.526
is 'cause they have
a fear of dying of HIV.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.277
Well, you can't die from HIV.
I mean, we know that.

14:20.444 --> 14:21.737
I know
you can't die of HIV.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.782
That's not what I'm saying.
What I'm... trying to say,

14:24.949 --> 14:27.535
is that someone
who doesn't even have HIV,

14:27.701 --> 14:30.204
and isn't even taking PrEP,
shouldn't probably

14:30.371 --> 14:32.581
- be telling people--
- I do take PrEP.

14:32.748 --> 14:33.916
What?

14:34.083 --> 14:37.211
The article's called
"Why I Take PrEP."

14:40.047 --> 14:44.176
I don't think you have to read the
article, per se, to get the point.

14:44.343 --> 14:45.970
Which is what?

14:50.099 --> 14:52.560
Okay! Well, you know a party's
really awesome when everyone

14:52.726 --> 14:54.270
starts to talk about AIDS.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.397
Um, as fun as this is for me,

14:56.564 --> 14:58.983
I'm gonna go to the bathroom right
now and jerk off to feline leukemia.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.859
Ooh!

15:01.026 --> 15:03.320
- What's feline leukemia?
- It's pussy cancer.

15:05.531 --> 15:09.952
- Well said, Doris.
- Thank you. I wanna educate.

15:13.581 --> 15:16.709
- Don't go to The EndUp.
- What do you mean?

15:16.875 --> 15:19.211
I mean I want you
to spend the night with me.

15:19.378 --> 15:21.046
Honey, I'm not a snuggler.

15:21.213 --> 15:24.425
Okay, we don't gotta snuggle.
I'll build a pillow wall between us.

15:24.592 --> 15:28.846
AgustÃ­n, I told you, okay,
when we talked about this,

15:29.013 --> 15:30.639
- that when we started--
- We don't gotta label it

15:30.806 --> 15:33.392
if you don't want to. No labels.
I know it freaks some people out.

15:33.559 --> 15:35.394
I like you, okay?
I like you,

15:35.561 --> 15:38.188
and I wanna see what you
smell like in the morning.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.149
- I bet it's the worst.
- It is the worst!

15:40.316 --> 15:42.526
Hey, there's a line out here!

15:42.693 --> 15:44.361
Here, give me.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.951
- She's all yours.
- Sorry.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.579
- Yum, yum. I smell drugs.
- Really?

15:53.746 --> 15:56.498
Yeah, yeah.
By the way, your girl...

15:56.665 --> 15:58.834
She's a tough one.

15:59.001 --> 16:02.171
You know, when I fall
for someone, I fall hard,

16:02.338 --> 16:05.591
and I think I might have
scared her.

16:05.758 --> 16:08.260
Yeah, you did...

16:08.427 --> 16:10.679
but I'm pretty sure
that's just because

16:10.846 --> 16:13.182
she feels the same way about you.

16:13.349 --> 16:15.100
- Yeah?
- Shh.

16:16.852 --> 16:20.147
Oh, come on,
Doris's BFF.

16:20.314 --> 16:22.316
All right, dude.
Good looking, man.

16:22.483 --> 16:24.610
Whoa, that is a titty
and a half!

16:24.777 --> 16:27.613
No, this is two titties. Technically,
it's four halves. Go ahead.

16:27.780 --> 16:30.115
May I?
Yes!

16:30.282 --> 16:31.992
As long as Doris don't see.
She might be weird about it.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.369
- That is...
- Oh!

17:03.899 --> 17:05.317
You're so beautiful.

17:05.484 --> 17:07.277
Hey!
Are you serious right now?

17:07.444 --> 17:09.238
- I don't know, am I?
- What am I, your sloppy party

17:09.405 --> 17:12.866
- leftovers? Happy Halloween, dick.
- What?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.702
Your playlist is garbage.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.246
This playlist
is fucking awesome, okay?

17:17.413 --> 17:20.708
- I quite fancy this song.
- What?

17:20.874 --> 17:24.128
- Hey. I know we didn't RSVP...
- Who's "we"?

17:24.294 --> 17:26.130
...but I thought
you wouldn't mind if...

17:26.296 --> 17:28.507
Uh, Patrick,
you remember Jon.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.676
Dude, amazing party!

17:30.843 --> 17:32.678
- It's really good.
- The city is nuts tonight.

17:32.845 --> 17:34.972
- It is nuts.
- Totally nuts.

17:35.139 --> 17:38.726
We saw a guy on the street,
balls out, balls out!

17:38.892 --> 17:41.645
- Ah!
- It was crazy.

17:41.812 --> 17:43.939
- That is so crazy.
- You know what we need?

17:44.106 --> 17:48.360
- Fucking... booze.
- That's right.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.696
Are you fucking kidding me right now?
This cannot be happening.

17:50.863 --> 17:52.322
I thought you wanted
to be a grown-up about this--

17:52.448 --> 17:54.324
What is grown up about bringing
your boyfriend to the house

17:54.491 --> 17:56.618
of the guy that you were
fucking cheating on him with?

17:56.785 --> 17:59.121
- Christ, Patrick, can you--
- Can I what, Kevin? Can I what?

17:59.288 --> 18:01.331
Okay, this is my party. All right?
It's my party, and I'm gonna...

18:01.498 --> 18:03.584
I'm gonna just say
what I want to say.

18:03.751 --> 18:05.669
Miss me?

18:07.337 --> 18:10.090
Excuse me for a second. Okay?

18:12.259 --> 18:14.052
- Hey, Paddy, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm great.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.512
I can ask them to leave
if you want me to.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.515
No, Dom, it's a fun gay party!
Why would we do that?

18:20.809 --> 18:22.686
You didn't sign up
for karaoke?

18:22.853 --> 18:25.689
I love
your Mega Man costume.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.404
Hey, Paddy. Just...

18:32.571 --> 18:34.740
What are you doing?

18:34.907 --> 18:37.618
Hello! Hello!
Is this thing on?

18:37.785 --> 18:40.829
Ah! Happy Halloween, everybody!

18:43.749 --> 18:46.335
I just wanted to say thank you,
everyone, for coming.

18:46.502 --> 18:49.254
This is mine and--
me and AgustÃ­n's party.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.381
We never have parties,
but this year I was like,

18:51.548 --> 18:53.926
"I wanna be a fun gay,
and fun gays have parties."

18:54.092 --> 18:59.681
So this is my party!

18:59.848 --> 19:02.684
I wanna know, though,
why is nobody singing karaoke?

19:02.851 --> 19:04.436
I mean, do people
not sing karaoke anymore?

19:04.603 --> 19:06.730
That's so weird, right?

19:06.897 --> 19:10.067
Well, later we'll sing.
But I just wanted tonight to say

19:10.234 --> 19:12.069
thank you, everyone,
for coming.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.696
I wanted to say
all my friends are here.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.406
Dom is here.
You all know Dom, right?

19:16.573 --> 19:18.909
He-Man,
Master of the Universe is here.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.828
Dom is actually
opening a restaurant.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.038
Well, it's not really
a restaurant, it's like...

19:23.205 --> 19:25.541
It's a chicken window.
I don't know what that is.

19:25.707 --> 19:29.670
He's gonna sell windows out of his
chicken and it's gonna be great.

19:29.837 --> 19:33.423
But he doesn't have any money. So
if we-- could you-- Excuse me, yes.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.843
Thank you so much.
I'm gonna take this hat,

19:36.009 --> 19:38.428
and we're gonna pass it around
and we're gonna do a collection,

19:38.595 --> 19:41.640
- like church. So if you have bills...
- You don't have to do that.

19:41.807 --> 19:44.852
No, Dom, shut up.
I love you. I love your chicken.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.895
Just pass that shit around
and we're gonna raise some money.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.981
And this is AgustÃ­n!

19:49.147 --> 19:51.108
And he's here
because he lives here.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.944
Also because
he looks amazing.

19:54.111 --> 19:56.071
And he called me
Clarissa Dalloway earlier.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.115
So if anybody knows what that means,
you can let me know.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.701
That would be great, but I wanna talk
to you for real, AgustÃ­n.

20:00.868 --> 20:02.786
Put the drink down
and look at me in the eyes.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.956
- And I wanna say...
- Excuse me, sorry.

20:06.123 --> 20:08.375
I'm really proud of you because

20:08.542 --> 20:11.253
you've really turned it around
this year. You're become thoughtful,

20:11.420 --> 20:14.172
and helpful, and you
take care of trans kids,

20:14.339 --> 20:18.427
and a rent check would be nice,
but I'm not gonna push it, right?

20:18.594 --> 20:21.221
Right? Richie?
Richie knows.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.891
Richie knows because...
Richie, this is crazy,

20:24.057 --> 20:27.269
but Richie actually picked
AgustÃ­n up off the street when

20:27.436 --> 20:30.898
he was on drugs. That's because
Richie's such a good person,

20:31.064 --> 20:32.816
and I think that we should all
raise a glass.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.193
If I could just, Carrie,
have your red punch.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.529
And raise a glass to Richie,

20:37.696 --> 20:40.073
and don't think I forgot
about you over there,

20:40.240 --> 20:42.701
laughing behind Richie.
That's Brady.

20:42.868 --> 20:45.954
Uh, which turns out
is Richie's soul mate.

20:47.456 --> 20:49.666
So... yeah, there's that.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.961
He's also actually,
I learned this evening,

20:53.128 --> 20:57.382
the gay Dr. Ruth. So if anybody needs
their Truvada prescription filled,

20:57.549 --> 21:01.303
that ginger over there in the crown
is the one you go to, all right?

21:01.470 --> 21:04.473
You go, you guys. Cheers.
And also to--

21:04.640 --> 21:07.017
While we're at it, I'd like to raise
a glass to my boss, Kevin.

21:07.184 --> 21:11.271
Kevin, hi!
Look, Owen, it's Kevin and Jon!

21:11.438 --> 21:13.148
His longtime boyfriend!
Isn't it great

21:13.315 --> 21:15.233
when two gay guys can
just work it out like that?

21:15.400 --> 21:17.819
I think it's amazing.
So I just wanted to say, Kevin,

21:17.986 --> 21:20.030
these last few weeks
have been so special.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.115
In particular, that time
a couple weeks ago

21:22.282 --> 21:23.617
when we were alone at the office--

21:23.784 --> 21:24.952
No, no, no! I haven't gotten
the chance--

21:25.118 --> 21:27.162
No, I am Gordon Freeman,
okay?

21:27.329 --> 21:30.248
He's the most popular video
game character of all time!

21:30.415 --> 21:32.960
Okay? Gordon Freeman!
How do you people not know that?

21:33.126 --> 21:34.753
- You know who that is, right?
- Make sure no one uploads

21:34.920 --> 21:38.423
- any videos on YouTube.
- He's a video game character.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.051
- Shit.
- Motherfucker.

21:41.218 --> 21:43.679
That was a train wreck.

21:43.845 --> 21:47.849
Apparently, Patrick's little
breakdown only got us about,

21:48.016 --> 21:49.810
- what, 12, 13 dollars.
- Great.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.520
It's okay, we can buy
a new, little chicken with it.

21:51.687 --> 21:54.481
- Our first chicken.
- Where's Malik?

21:54.648 --> 21:56.316
He is in the car.
He's changing his shoes.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.151
He's kind of done
with the whole Cher thing.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.821
He's really great.
You know that, right?

22:00.988 --> 22:03.198
Oh, really? What, did he rim you
or something?

22:03.365 --> 22:05.242
- No.
- You gotta watch that guy.

22:05.409 --> 22:07.786
- He loves ass. He's all up in it.
- Doris.

22:07.953 --> 22:09.830
Yeah, I know, okay?
I know he's great. I know he's great.

22:09.997 --> 22:12.374
I know he's great.
He's a little too great.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.167
It's scaring the shit out of me.
I'm not...

22:14.334 --> 22:16.003
I don't like the whole
couple's costume thing too.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.963
I wish we hadn't done it.
It's freaking me out

22:18.130 --> 22:21.383
'cause Sonny and Cher? Ugh.
You know how that turned out.

22:21.550 --> 22:24.344
- Do you know what I think?
- What?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.638
I think you two
are great together.

22:26.805 --> 22:29.099
Man.
Oh, my God.

22:29.266 --> 22:31.935
- These shoes are no joke.
- Hey!

22:32.102 --> 22:34.771
Fuck.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.565
You know,
if it's any consolation,

22:36.732 --> 22:39.443
there was only one suicide
during Clarissa Dalloway's parties.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.486
- I still don't know who that is.
- Your party's been way better.

22:41.653 --> 22:44.031
- I still don't know who that is.
- It's Virginia Woolf. <i>Mrs. Dalloway.</i>

22:44.197 --> 22:48.160
Well, that was...
that was quite a speech.

22:52.956 --> 22:55.751
- Sorry, do you mind if--
- Yeah, actually, I do mind.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.378
No, AgustÃ­n, it's fine.
Really.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.477
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm sorry.

23:13.643 --> 23:16.271
I'm drunk, and we were at a bar
around the corner--

23:16.438 --> 23:19.441
I don't want you
to go to Seattle.

23:19.608 --> 23:23.278
I don't want us being weird to be
the reason I never see you again.

23:25.322 --> 23:29.034
- Patrick--
- I'd miss you too much if you go.

23:34.623 --> 23:35.999
Here you two are.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.961
I thought the party
was inside.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.716
I just came to get
the karaoke sign-up sheet.

23:44.883 --> 23:47.260
- Seen it?
- Yeah, I've got that.

23:50.097 --> 23:52.974
I will, uh,
I'll just unfold it.

23:54.101 --> 23:56.186
You know,
'cause I slay Celine Dion.

23:56.353 --> 23:59.064
- I really do. Don't I, babe?
- Oh, my God. You do, yes.

23:59.231 --> 24:01.358
- Fuck yeah, I do.
- Fuck yeah.

24:05.821 --> 24:10.325
- Is everything all right?
- Mm-hmm. You?

24:10.492 --> 24:11.701
Yeah.

24:13.829 --> 24:15.997
- Can we go?
- Really?

24:16.164 --> 24:19.835
Hmm...
Yeah, fuck me, I'm tired,

24:20.001 --> 24:22.170
and I'm drunk.

24:22.337 --> 24:25.715
Um, I'm... I'm drunk.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.554
Okay.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.975
Happy Halloween, Patrick.

24:37.269 --> 24:39.146
The happiest.

24:43.024 --> 24:45.443
Good luck in Seattle.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.863
I hope everything
works out the way you want.

24:50.031 --> 24:51.533
What does that mean?
