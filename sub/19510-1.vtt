YOU'RE DOING.

18:51.361 --> 18:52.532
OK. IT'S REALLY SWEET,

18:52.532 --> 18:54.664
AND I APPRECIATE YOU
TRYING TO HELP.

18:54.664 --> 18:57.537
BUT THIS IS REALLY
BETWEEN ME AND SAM.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.868
ALL RIGHT, BUT FOR
WHATEVER IT'S WORTH,

18:58.868 --> 19:00.570

THAT HE'S REALLY,

19:00.570 --> 19:02.672

19:04.274 --> 19:06.546
SO AM I.
AND FURIOUS.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.579

19:10.750 --> 19:12.422
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW I FEEL

19:12.422 --> 19:13.753
WHEN I EAT
INDIAN FOOD.

19:13.753 --> 19:18.358
LISTEN, IT'S JUST--
IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.361
BUT I LOVE
THE LETTER, THOUGH.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.533
AND IT MAKES ME SMILE,
SO THANKS.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.935
UH, THAT'S A REALLY GREAT PEN.

19:25.935 --> 19:28.398
I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE THAT BACK.

19:50.820 --> 19:51.561
IT WORKED!

19:51.561 --> 19:54.464
NOT SO MUCH, SPORT.
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

19:54.464 --> 19:57.727
THAT YOUR PENTAGRAM
IS ACTUALLY A STAR OF DAVID.

19:57.727 --> 20:00.500
MAZAL TOV! [LAUGHS]

20:00.500 --> 20:02.732
WELL, UM, AS LONG
AS YOU'RE HERE,

20:02.732 --> 20:05.905
I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD
ASK YOU A FAVOR.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.807
NOT A FAVOR,
BUT A REQUEST.

20:07.807 --> 20:08.738
A FAMILY REQUEST.

20:08.738 --> 20:10.980
HOLY CRAP, WHERE
DID YOU GET THIS BOOK?

20:10.980 --> 20:13.443
"THE DEVIL IS
ATTRACTED TO RADISHES."

20:13.443 --> 20:15.745
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
LIKE, SEXUALLY?

20:15.745 --> 20:18.448
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.
WHERE DID THEY GET THAT?

20:18.448 --> 20:22.422
LISTEN, I WAS THINKING,
GIVEN OUR SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP,

20:22.422 --> 20:23.493
THAT MAYBE...

20:23.493 --> 20:25.825
YOU COULD LIGHTEN
MY WORKLOAD A BIT.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.497
OUR SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP?

20:27.497 --> 20:30.530
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
TAKE A FEW SOULS
OFF MY HANDS,

20:30.530 --> 20:33.303

20:33.303 --> 20:34.634

20:34.634 --> 20:35.965
IF YOU WANTED TO.
HMM.

20:35.965 --> 20:37.837
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
LET ME SAY,

20:37.837 --> 20:40.540
I LIKE THAT YOU'RE PLAYING
THE NEPOTISM CARD.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.413
IT SHOWS A CERTAIN
MORAL DISREGARD

20:43.413 --> 20:45.515
THAT I FIND UTTERLY CHARMING.

20:45.515 --> 20:46.376
AND SECONDLY,

20:46.376 --> 20:47.817
I HAVE TO SAY NO.

20:47.817 --> 20:51.681
YOUR DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS
REMAIN STATUS QUO.

20:51.681 --> 20:52.522
BUT WHY?

20:52.522 --> 20:54.554
LET ME GIVE YOU
A LITTLE HISTORY LESSON, SAM.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.587
I HAVE BEEN SOILING
PURE, INNOCENT MAIDENS

20:57.587 --> 21:00.360
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.393
I HAVE SIRED MANY, MANY,
MANY CHILDREN

21:03.393 --> 21:05.535
ON THIS GODFORSAKEN PLANET,

21:05.535 --> 21:06.436
HOPING THAT EACH

21:06.436 --> 21:10.840
WOULD FINALLY BE THE ONE
WHO WOULD BRING ABOUT
HELL ON EARTH.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.644
BUT NO, THEY ALL TURN OUT
TO BE DUDS.

21:14.644 --> 21:16.446
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

21:16.446 --> 21:20.480
SO I WILL SAY TO YOU
WHAT I SAY TO THEM--

21:20.480 --> 21:23.553
STOP WHINING,
AND DO YOUR JOB.

21:23.553 --> 21:24.584
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE
GIVEN ME

21:24.584 --> 21:26.285
A STUPID RECHARGING

21:26.285 --> 21:27.757
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO CATCH 20 SOULS
WITH THAT?

21:27.757 --> 21:31.321
WELL, TO BE PRECISE,
IT'S NOT 20 SOULS ANYMORE.

21:31.321 --> 21:33.893
IT'S 40.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.028
YOU'RE TRYING
TO KILL ME.

21:39.028 --> 21:41.471
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO KILL ME?

21:41.471 --> 21:43.903
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE MY FATHER.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.936
WELL, EVEN IN THE WILD,

21:46.936 --> 21:49.078
PARENTS KILL THEIR YOUNG.

21:49.078 --> 21:51.911
YEAH, LOOK AT HYENAS,

21:51.911 --> 21:52.712

21:52.712 --> 21:54.544
AND THAT'S NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL.

21:54.544 --> 21:56.846
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS--I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

21:56.846 --> 21:58.548
ALL I'M SAYING IS...

21:58.548 --> 22:02.622
YOU'RE NOT AS SPECIAL
AS YOU THINK YOU ARE, BUDDY.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.054
DON'T YOU FORGET THAT.

22:05.495 --> 22:09.599
EITHER YOU FIGURE
THIS THING OUT
AND SAVE YOUR SKIN...

22:09.599 --> 22:13.503

I'M JUST SAYIN'.
[CHUCKLES]

22:34.454 --> 22:35.825
THERE'S NO BENEFIT
TO BEING THE DEVIL'S
SON AT ALL?

22:35.825 --> 22:37.387
NO. APPARENTLY HE'S GOT
A TON OF KIDS,

22:37.387 --> 22:38.558
AND HE THINKS THEY ALL SUCK.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.889

22:39.889 --> 22:42.061
MR. HANDLEY,
MY FIFTH GRADE
GYM TEACHER.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.963
HE USED TO
THROW BASEBALLS
AT MY HEAD.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.735
IT'S THE REASON WHY
I HAVE MIGRAINES.

22:45.735 --> 22:49.599
I BET HE'S ONE OF
THE DEVIL'S KIDS.

WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW
TO CAPTURE THESE JERKS

23:01.981 --> 23:03.382
AND NOT GET KILLED.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.484

THERE'S TRAIN TRACKS
