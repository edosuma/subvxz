WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.080
It's not an offer. I still
have to go through an interview.

00:03.240 --> 00:05.040
Yeah! Wednesday the 30th.
I know. I saw the email.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.880
You read my private messages?

00:08.039 --> 00:10.681
- You told me to look in your mail.
- You didn't have to read them.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.280
- You didn't have to have...
- You have to control everything!

00:13.440 --> 00:16.360
How do you find the defendant,
dianne vasilich?

00:16.480 --> 00:17.680
Guilty.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.320
My client is an innocent woman.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.880
She and her son have been imprisoned
for a crime they did not commit.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.680
Janet king's gung-ho approach
in this trial

00:24.840 --> 00:27.240
has caused a serious
miscarriage of justice.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.800
A bushwalker
just found Steven Blakely's body.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.880
- Who buried him?
- I have no idea.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.520
You find us this third man
or dianne and her son will walk.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.320
Steven blakely was murdered
and buried with a cricket bat,

00:39.480 --> 00:42.160
which mr cranford would have known
if he'd buried him,

00:42.280 --> 00:44.800
which he most clearly did not.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.280
Mr moreno, I find you not guilty.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.640
You are free to go.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.680
Blakely's murder was
just a small part of it.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.400
If you want to sort this mess,
ask yourself -

00:57.560 --> 00:59.960
how did Alex moreno
manage to get acquitted?

01:00.080 --> 01:03.360
Tim Clarke, my child porn man.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.040
- You get fuck away from her!
Get the fuck away!
- What the hell?

01:06.200 --> 01:09.720
That's what you did in adelaide.
You're a filthy fucking rapist.

01:09.840 --> 01:10.960
You're nuts, woman.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.240
I'll look after you.
Who is she?

01:13.400 --> 01:15.960
Touch her and I'll kill you.
You forced her into your car.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.360
I saw you.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.520
Leave my dad alone.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.240 --> 01:47.160
I tried to talk him
out of charging you.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.121
Doesn't matter.
Lots of witnesses, apparently.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.120
Yeah.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.680
And the jerk is playing the victim
for all he's worth.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.280
There was a moment,

02:01.400 --> 02:02.760
when I was...

02:02.880 --> 02:06.000
..When I was watching him

02:06.120 --> 02:07.760
with the girl, just a...

02:10.039 --> 02:11.480
..Just a second...

02:13.880 --> 02:15.920
..Where I thought about
letting him go...

02:17.880 --> 02:22.800
..Letting him do whatever
he was going to do to her...

02:28.880 --> 02:31.040
..Just so there'd be something...

02:35.480 --> 02:38.120
Just so there'd be
something concrete against him.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.960
You shouldn't have been
anywhere near him.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.480
That's so much better than fighting.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.920
Yes, it is.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.760
I know it's late.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.880
Let me guess - fraud.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.520
Child pornographer.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.880
The criminals aren't the only ones
who need your attention.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.080
I've missed something. I don't know
what, but I've missed something.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.200
Find it in the morning.
It's serious.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.960
It's always serious.
No, this is serious.

03:43.120 --> 03:48.680
You're not a cop. Solving blakely's
murder is not your responsibility.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.160
I know that look.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.000
Another half hour.
A girl could die waiting.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.480
Please?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.240
We had our chance.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.160
They're fast-tracking
the vasilich appeal.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.959
Just been
served the defence submission -

04:19.079 --> 04:20.519
public interest and all that crap.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.520
First we had to hurry up
and prosecute her

04:22.680 --> 04:24.680
because of the bloody
supersensitive public,

04:24.840 --> 04:26.960
now we have to unprosecute her
even faster.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.800
Shit.
It plays right into the ag's hands.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.440
Another nail in the coffin
of jury trials.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.000
Let the court of criminal appeal

04:34.160 --> 04:37.320
sort out another mess
juries have got us into.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.600
It's all our fault of course because
we're too bloody good at our jobs.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.280
That's how they'll spin it.
Can I put my bags down first?

04:43.440 --> 04:46.080
No, I want you
in as much of a lather as I am.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.320
Fast-tracking means
it's right on top of us.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.360
We need to look at
judge renmark's decisions

04:50.520 --> 04:52.440
over the last few years
as a matter of urgency.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.160
Can't we just focus on one crisis
at a time? Is renmark a crisis?

04:57.280 --> 04:59.040
Forget about the moreno case.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.920
Danny novak was
messing with your mind.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.400
Why would he bother?

05:02.560 --> 05:04.600
Other than he's a murdering
arsehole, no idea.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.720
Your place or mine?
Yours. Just give me five. Erin?

05:07.880 --> 05:10.520
Pull judge renmark's decisions
over the last two years.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.000
What, why?

05:12.120 --> 05:14.880
Something was dodgy in moreno.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.360
What do you think?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.200
Congratulations on your promotion.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.320
I wish I didn't have to wait to be a
crown before I get to wear all this.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.800
Appearing in a suit doesn't
feel like such a big deal.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.600
Being promoted to a solicitor
advocate is a big deal.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.640
Now I'm starting
to feel a bit nervous.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.640
Good - you're taking it seriously.
It's a training position.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.280
You'll only be given simpler matters
to start with.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.320
Like the simple matters thrown at me
when I first joined the dpp?

05:37.480 --> 05:41.680
It's what you wanted, remember that.
You applied for it. You'll be fine.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.160
Thank you for all your help.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.800
I didn't do anything.
Yes, you did.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.760
You know you did. I'll never
be able to thank you enough.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.600
You can get me another cup of tea

05:50.760 --> 05:54.040
as I prepare myself
for the dianne vasilich appeal.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.400
They're pretty gross?

05:59.240 --> 06:01.480
I didn't get your message
till this morning.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.960
I'm so sorry. What happened?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.840
I wanted to kill him.
I don't blame you.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.880
No, I really wanted to kill him.
Tony's going to hit the roof.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.920
He's not having a good morning.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.680
A cup of tea for me.
Very thoughtful.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.160
You're out of luck.
This one's for Janet.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.400
Wouldn't want to steal anything
of Janet's.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.440
Best not. Talk to you later.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.160
Very close those two, aren't they?

06:22.280 --> 06:24.320
Erin helped deliver Janet's twins.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.200
There's a whole lot of images
I wasn't expecting this morning.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.960
By the way, congratulations
on the dirty Harry act.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.520
Word travels fast.

06:31.680 --> 06:36.080
We're jealous. You did the one thing
none of us had the guts to do.

06:36.240 --> 06:39.200
Lina, it's going to be fine.
You'll get a slap on the wrist

06:39.360 --> 06:41.840
and both sides of the bar table
lining up to buy you a drink.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.880
And you'll have to undergo
months of compulsory counselling.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.360
I could lose my job.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.160
Now, there is the upside.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.240
I'm the obvious person to run it.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.200
You think dianne vasilich is guilty?

06:56.360 --> 06:58.360
That's not relevant
if I think we got it wrong.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.760
What's this,
a self-flagellation thing, is it?

07:00.920 --> 07:03.920
A mistake is made, you want to take
the rap, restore your reputation?

07:04.040 --> 07:05.440
This has nothing to do with pride.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.160
Yes, it does. Pride, ego, face -
call it what you will.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.280
You're not following due process.
Trial lawyers never run appeals.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.000
That's why we have an appellate
section full of weirdy geeks

07:15.120 --> 07:16.600
who get off on academic fine points.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.920
I know this case.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.400
There won't be time for anyone
to get their head around it.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.360
It's loaded, you know that.
It has been from the start.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.880
All the more reason for one of the
whisperers to have carriage of it.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.120
Then if there's a lynch mob,
they can deal with it.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.320
You're happy for one of them
to be Cannon fodder?

07:31.480 --> 07:33.360
Jesus, do you have to
argue with everything?

07:33.480 --> 07:34.840
I'm trying to protect you.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.040
I'm a grown-up, Tony.
I don't need your protection.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.680
I need those judgements of renmark's
on my desk in half an hour.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.680
Sure.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.360
And whatever you've got
on the vasilich appeal.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.600
You want me to instruct
one of the whisperers?

07:51.760 --> 07:55.200
You'll be instructing me,
whatever Tony says.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.800
Thanks for coming.
An unexpected pleasure.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.120
I've been going over
the Alex moreno case.

08:02.280 --> 08:06.120
Waste of time. The judge got
it wrong. Happens all the time.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.560
A judge who's
known to be pro-police?

08:08.720 --> 08:12.240
He might have had a fight with his
wife or a bourbon with breakfast.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.960
He might have an undiagnosed
brain tumour. Who knows?

08:15.120 --> 08:18.520
Judges are just another variable
we deal with every day. It's done.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.240
We move on to the next catastrophe.
Just like that?

08:21.360 --> 08:22.720
What's the alternative?

08:22.880 --> 08:25.760
There wasn't anything
about the case itself, moreno,

08:25.880 --> 08:27.920
that was out of the ordinary?

08:30.080 --> 08:33.799
I'd really like to help you
with your conspiracy theory,

08:33.960 --> 08:37.080
but I was there,
watching Caroline, the informant,

08:37.240 --> 08:40.200
asking myself,
'does she make a good witness?

08:40.320 --> 08:42.240
How does she handle the courtroom?'

08:42.400 --> 08:46.000
if we're going to use cops
to trap paedophiles this way,

08:46.160 --> 08:50.040
I'd like to know I've got
the right people in the job.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.200
I like to do this
with all my undercover people.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.720
You might call me a control freak.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.440
I just want to make sure

08:57.600 --> 09:01.080
that the resources
are productively utilised.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.480
What are you wasting your time for?

09:03.640 --> 09:06.720
I thought you guys
were up to your eyeballs.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.520
I'm a control freak too.

09:08.680 --> 09:13.720
Why don't you put that energy into
keeping dianne vasilich in prison?

09:13.840 --> 09:16.320
She murdered a good friend of mine.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.880
Thanks for the coffee.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.520
Please! I just want to go outside.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.000
Don't!

09:41.240 --> 09:42.720
I don't like it.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.280
It makes me feel funny.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.240
I don't like this game.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.720
Sorry. Can I disturb you
for a moment?

10:15.800 --> 10:18.640
I heard about you being charged.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.640
Seems like everyone has.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.880
Maybe this unit
isn't right for you, lina.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.480
I could talk to Tony on your behalf.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.520
I can talk to Tony by myself.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.080
I thought you wouldn't mind
if it came from someone else.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.320
I saw the email about
the solicitor advocate position.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.960
You've organised Erin's career,
and now it's my turn?

10:41.080 --> 10:43.200
You're not still working on Clarke,
are you?

10:43.320 --> 10:45.080
Until Tony tells me not to.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.760
Tony's got his hands full
with the vasilich appeal.

10:47.920 --> 10:52.760
You know you can't work on this
if you've assaulted the defendant.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.960
Are these photos from...

11:07.080 --> 11:09.280
From a Russian website, yeah.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.880
This is Ruby moreno.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.280
Her father was the child groomer,
the one renmark acquitted.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.760
The photographer?

11:27.800 --> 11:29.520
Are you sure?

11:45.800 --> 11:49.560
I saw her in court.
She was there with her mother.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.680
It's not moreno's house.
You sure?

11:54.800 --> 11:56.040
It's not his home.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.480
He lives in one of those open,
warehousy-type places.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.040
Inner city, very groovy.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.000
Do you know if he owns
any other houses?

12:02.160 --> 12:04.960
Not that we could find.
Nothing in his or his wife's name.

12:05.120 --> 12:09.720
This changes everything. I'd love
to have another go at the creep.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.560
Thanks for bringing it
to my attention.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.240
Will you bring moreno in?
No point, we'd just tip him off,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.280
but I'm happy to put him
under surveillance.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.640
I'll find out about his daughter and
her friends. They might be involved.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.720
Do we have a date of birth for her?

12:21.880 --> 12:24.440
In this photo she could be 12,
or 17, 18.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.160
I can find out.
She's 14 or 15, from memory.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.120
Prove she's under 16
and we get Clarke.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.840
Was there anything else about moreno
that didn't make it to the brief,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.920
something you suspected
but couldn't prove?

12:36.080 --> 12:38.480
He's a creep who takes
pornographic photos of children,

12:38.640 --> 12:43.400
including maybe his own daughter.
What else did you have in mind?

12:43.520 --> 12:45.360
I'm not sure yet.

12:45.520 --> 12:49.400
We should stop meeting like this.
People will talk.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.800
My office has received
an application

12:52.920 --> 12:54.760
for a pardon for dianne vasilich.

12:54.920 --> 12:58.040
What? They haven't even
started the bloody appeal yet.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.560
I asked you to sort this out.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.440
We did. She was convicted,
if memory serves.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.920
I don't want anyone to think

13:04.080 --> 13:06.880
this government has locked up
an innocent person. Shut it down.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.640
You're the number-one prosecutor
in this state.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.880
I want you to run this appeal
and win it.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.360
That's a specialist job.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.200
I don't want to read
that pardon petition.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.680
It'd be a dangerous precedent.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.280
We need this conviction to stand.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.080
Of course.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.480
I'll have a word
to the chief justice,

13:23.640 --> 13:27.360
see if we can organise
something about the bench.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.960
You're starting vasilich without me.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.760
I asked him to look at it.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.080
I know the case, Tony. I have time.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.840
You want the good news
or the bad news?

13:43.960 --> 13:45.320
The good news is,

13:45.480 --> 13:47.720
our esteemed attorney-general
cares so much about us,

13:47.880 --> 13:51.160
she wants to know about every single
thing that comes across our desk.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.240
She wants to be involved.
Warms the cockles, doesn't it?

13:54.400 --> 13:57.640
The bad news is
she's dragging you off the field

13:57.800 --> 14:01.800
and sacrificing me to their honours
of the court of criminal appeal.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.840
That's ridiculous.
You can't run this case.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.440
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.840
Sorry. I meant,
as director of public prosecutions.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.800
No, you're right, I can't run it.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.280
But as I've discovered, as dpp,

14:11.440 --> 14:13.080
I have even less power
than I had before.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.520
I'm nothing more than
the ag's factotum,

14:16.680 --> 14:20.400
a word that sadly sounds ruder
than it actually is.

14:20.560 --> 14:25.360
So, I'll start with these
and meet you in hell.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.560
The renmark judgements are all
on your desk, the last two years,

14:29.720 --> 14:32.000
plus an article he wrote
for the law journal

14:32.160 --> 14:33.720
and a paper he delivered
last November

14:33.880 --> 14:35.840
at the australasian
convention of jurists.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Thanks. I'd better get on with this
for Tony.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.840
Let me know
if you need anything else.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.320
Bloody hr are leaning on me

14:48.480 --> 14:50.960
to take some of my 300 years'
accumulated leave.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.640
I get a call like that
every two weeks.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.720
This time they're not taking no
for an answer.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.200
Bullshit. Now?

14:56.360 --> 14:58.200
They want you to step up
and run my patch.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.360
What about the blakely case?

15:00.520 --> 15:03.000
I'm running the investigation
of the biggest shitstorm

15:03.120 --> 15:04.520
this department's seen in years.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.200
I tried to suggest somebody else,
but they wouldn't budge.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.280
You're free to take on
the high commissioner.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.760
We have this cranford scumbag
right in front of us.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.440
He knows who was involved.
We've got to keep leaning on him.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.760
Don't worry. The task force
continues, just without you.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.120
Who are they bringing in?

15:21.280 --> 15:24.680
A guy called ramesh nahar.
I don't know him.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.400
Apparently quite thorough.

15:26.560 --> 15:30.680
I feel so much better now.
Has he ever handled a homicide?

15:32.240 --> 15:33.720
Perfect.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.720
It's not all that bad.
Means they've got their eye on you.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.360
The timing's shit, but ultimately,
it's great for your career.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.400
You ready to start the handover?

15:43.560 --> 15:46.160
Thought you might
give me a lift home.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.640
I could do that.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.480
They've pulled me off
the task force.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.360
I have to mind the fort for
Jack rizzoli for a couple of weeks.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.800
They've promoted you?
It's babysitting.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.480
The guy they've brought in
to do my job, ramesh nahar,

15:59.600 --> 16:00.800
spent all day reading.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.720
Wants to see every piece of
everything before he makes a move.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.200
We could all be dead by then.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.080
That does mean you've gone up
a rung.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.000
It means that
they've taken me off blakely.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.120
What's the obsession with promotion?

16:13.280 --> 16:16.520
Having a criminal wife
hasn't affected your career.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.640
I'm not shitty with you.
You've hardly spoken to me.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.280
I've hardly been around!

16:21.440 --> 16:24.440
You haven't really been around
since blakely died.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.520
You know why
I don't like vigilantes?

16:26.680 --> 16:29.920
Other than the total breakdown
of society?

16:30.080 --> 16:34.320
Because they can get it wrong.
They can get themselves killed.

16:34.480 --> 16:38.000
What if that scumbag Clarke suddenly
hit back at you, really lost it?

16:38.160 --> 16:40.680
There were a lot of people around.
What if there weren't?

16:40.840 --> 16:43.200
What if he had a knife?
Leave that stuff to us.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.360
So you can get knifed instead of me?
That would be my preference, yeah.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.880
If Jack doesn't come back, will they
keep you in his job, behind a desk?

16:52.040 --> 16:54.960
I'd go crazy.
Better crazy than dead.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.920
Ooh, bubbles.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.400
Bubbles!

17:04.560 --> 17:07.280
This is so much easier,
with the two of us.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.000
Yeah.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.040
They look so cute together.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.839
Hey, don't do that.
Do what?

17:14.960 --> 17:16.520
Take a photo of them in the bath.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.960
Relax. They look gorgeous.
Don't!

17:19.119 --> 17:21.319
Got to have something embarrassing
for their 21st.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.680
You take photos,
put them on the computer,

17:23.839 --> 17:25.960
we get hacked,
who knows where they end up?

17:26.079 --> 17:28.000
A couple of kids in the bath?

17:28.119 --> 17:30.520
Yes, a couple of kids in the bath.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.400
Ok, fine. Point taken.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.120
This is what I was talking about.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.880
An innocent picture
taken by a doting parent,

17:48.040 --> 17:50.280
or a still from a video
in a Sydney house

17:50.400 --> 17:52.440
that ended up on a Russian porn site

17:52.600 --> 17:55.200
and was downloaded
by a man in homebush?

17:55.320 --> 17:56.680
How terrible.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.320
A beach house?
Well, she's wearing swimmers.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.000
Dolphins on the wall.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.640
People always decorate beach houses
with beachy stuff.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.120
It's weird -
the beach is just out the window.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.680
I can even tell you which beach, but
I guess the cops already told you.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.160
No, they haven't.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.200
See here?

18:15.360 --> 18:17.640
What?
There's a reflection.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.120
The lighthouse.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.120
I never noticed that.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.600
I think it's point Galloway.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.600
We used to go to that part
of the coast every January

18:27.720 --> 18:29.240
for years and years.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.160
Whose house is this?

18:47.040 --> 18:49.040
We're off.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.520
Already?

18:50.680 --> 18:52.360
Mothers' group likes
to get to the cafe early,

18:52.480 --> 18:53.840
make sure we all get seats.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.360
I'll let you know if I hear anything
from st Bart's.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.640
Fingers crossed.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.400
You need a hand?
I'm fine. Do it all the time.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.880
Ashleigh Larsson?

19:03.040 --> 19:05.600
How long has Janet been
sleeping with Erin o'shaughnessy?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.080
Did you know about this affair?

19:07.240 --> 19:09.840
Did you know she organised
a promotion for Erin at the dpp?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.960
Janet?
She was on the selection committee.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.480
Just get inside, ash.
I'm happy to speak to you first.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.960
You promoted your lover, Erin.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.040
Would you describe this promotion
as typical

19:18.200 --> 19:19.960
of the gay mafia
operating within the dpp?

19:20.120 --> 19:21.880
How dare you invade
the privacy of my home?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.920
Do all your lovers get promoted?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.240
That is not why miss o'shaughnessy
was promoted.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.280
How does it feel, being responsible
for jailing an innocent woman?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.760
You're on private property.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.960
Senior crown prosecutor Janet king

19:33.120 --> 19:35.160
today denied
an improper relationship

19:35.320 --> 19:37.400
with dpp solicitor
Erin o'shaughnessy.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.640
Miss king has further
denied allegations

19:39.760 --> 19:41.800
of a gay mafia within the dpp,

19:41.960 --> 19:44.120
and that miss o'shaughnessy's
recent promotion

19:44.280 --> 19:45.880
was based on anything
other than merit.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.440
Jesus, it's everywhere.
You could read about it on Mars.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.920
There was only one reporter.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.600
The rest of the world's caught up.
Gay mafia.

19:52.760 --> 19:56.760
Just the kind of bullshit muckraking
this department needs.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.640
How did they know where I live?

20:01.280 --> 20:04.320
No bloody comment. Is ash alright?
No, not really.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.160
She's stuck in with two kids,
doesn't want to venture outside.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.640
But the two of you...

20:08.800 --> 20:11.680
You're asking me
if she thinks I'm guilty?

20:11.840 --> 20:13.440
I'm an insensitive baboon.
I'm sorry.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.520
Look, if you want to go home...

20:15.680 --> 20:19.640
I don't care if they hassle me
about my work, but my family?

20:19.800 --> 20:22.520
Just as well
I'm the bunny in the headlights

20:22.640 --> 20:25.320
doing the vasilich appeal, isn't it?

20:25.440 --> 20:27.440
That's the golden lining, is it?

20:30.760 --> 20:33.600
Who would think that Janet and I...
Not me. I can vouch for you

20:33.760 --> 20:36.560
having screwed your way through
half the male legal fraternity.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.040
That doesn't help.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.800
But for someone who doesn't know you
as intimately as I do,

20:40.920 --> 20:42.280
you and Janet seem very close.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.080
Friends.
I know. Friends.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.840
You and I
spend a lot of time together.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.800
You and Janet hugged.
So have you and I!

20:47.920 --> 20:49.280
But I'm not gay.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.240
Because it's Janet, it's
ridiculous to assume we're lovers.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.360
Someone saw her take you into the
conference room and close the door.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.360
That's the type of thing we wouldn't
do if we were having an affair.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.720
I know, I know. I'm just trying to
put myself in someone else's shoes.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.800
Someone who's out to get me,
or Janet.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.680
Can you see how it might look
from their perspective?

21:06.840 --> 21:08.880
Ok, so it might look suss.
That's one thing.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.760
But ringing some current affairs
show and spilling it to them?

21:11.920 --> 21:16.440
Why would anyone do that,
and which of those arseholes was it?

21:18.400 --> 21:21.880
You and I are really
in the shit now, aren't we?

21:24.120 --> 21:27.120
I'm very sorry this has happened.

21:27.240 --> 21:30.160
The gutter press can be so brutal.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.880
Can I get you anything?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.320
No, I'm fine, but thank you.

21:35.440 --> 21:36.640
I don't blame you.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.840
Erin is a beautiful girl,
and she knows how to use it.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.880
You're not the first
to be caught in her net.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.760
At least in your case,
it's not adultery.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.680
You have to be married
to commit adultery,

21:45.840 --> 21:47.320
and you're not even really in
a relationship,

21:47.440 --> 21:50.040
in the eyes of the lord.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.320
Lust can make fools of us all.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.240
Fuck off, Tracey.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.640
Close the door.

22:33.800 --> 22:38.440
Isn't that going to look suss?
Can you just close the door, please?

22:45.280 --> 22:46.960
You alright?

22:47.080 --> 22:48.960
Do you think it's Tracey?

22:49.080 --> 22:50.920
Tracey? No, no.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.000
She's as bigoted as they come,
but she loves this place.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.800
She'd never do anything
to create adverse publicity.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.920
Someone's happy to do it. I really
think we should keep the door open.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.880
Someone might have seen us.
The door's fine.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.360
How's ash? Is she ok?

23:10.920 --> 23:12.400
She'll get there.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.480
Would it help if I talked to her?
I don't think so.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.560
She doesn't think
there's anything going on?

23:17.720 --> 23:20.920
Of course not. I can still
come round, see you guys?

23:21.080 --> 23:25.320
I think it's better
if we just leave it for a bit.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.800
Fair enough.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.320
Just for a while.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.560
For the vasilich appeal,

23:42.720 --> 23:44.720
finding blakely's body
constitutes new evidence,

23:44.880 --> 23:48.080
evidence that was available or could
have been found with due diligence.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.720
As opposed to fresh evidence,
which wasn't in existence

23:50.880 --> 23:52.400
at the time of the trial?
Correct.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.040
If the police had done their job
and found blakely's body

23:55.200 --> 23:58.160
before charging dianne vasilich,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.960
Possibly, but just because she
didn't dispose of the body...

24:01.120 --> 24:03.920
They're going to argue that
this new evidence means

24:04.080 --> 24:07.040
this conviction was, one,
unsafe or unsatisfactory,

24:07.160 --> 24:08.640
two, was wrong in law

24:08.800 --> 24:10.880
or three, constituted
a miscarriage of justice.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.080
You don't need me.
Not so fast.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.120
You're not going anywhere.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.520
I'm not getting on the floor.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.760
But these are part
of the defence submissions.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.840
I don't need a bloody map to tell me

24:35.000 --> 24:37.520
that vasilich and her son
couldn't bury blakely.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.320
For God's sake!

24:44.520 --> 24:46.000
Of course.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.040
What we want to argue for
is a retrial, correct?

24:50.160 --> 24:51.520
Definitely.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.400
What do we need to argue
to achieve that?

24:53.560 --> 24:56.120
We need to show that
there is no lurking doubt.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.280
We need to show the conviction
is safe, despite the new evidence.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.760
Lurking doubt?

25:00.920 --> 25:03.720
Lord widgery, crown and Cooper,
1969.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.280
'On the basis of the general feel
of the case

25:06.400 --> 25:07.760
as the court experiences it,

25:07.920 --> 25:10.880
there may remain a lurking doubt
in the minds of the appellate judges

25:11.040 --> 25:13.440
which makes them wonder
whether justice has been done.'

25:13.560 --> 25:14.600
general feel? Crap.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.720
They're not going to decide an
appeal on feelings.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.440
On the other hand, the high court
of Australia has stated that

25:19.600 --> 25:22.640
the question of reasonableness of a
jury's verdict is a question of law

25:22.760 --> 25:24.440
and not of feel -

25:24.600 --> 25:26.960
the court's function
is analytical, not instinctive.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.440
If the high court says that,

25:28.600 --> 25:31.360
why are we bothering with
all this lurking doubt bullshit?

25:31.520 --> 25:34.160
Because all judges,
and lawyers, use intuition.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.000
Any decision anyone makes
is never purely analytical.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.840
Emotion plays a huge part.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.280
It's one of the things that's been
proven in neural-plasticity studies.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.840
The brain's wiring
emphatically relies on

25:45.000 --> 25:48.320
emotion over intellect
in decision-making.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.280
You should have an affair
with Janet.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.800
She can get you promoted
to the appellate section,

25:53.960 --> 25:56.840
and you could play with
all the other little whisperers.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.440
Let's not contradict the high court

25:58.600 --> 26:03.000
in front of the court of
criminal appeal. Not this time, ok?

26:06.760 --> 26:09.080
Just got to get my bulldog clip.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.040
I'm working in here today.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.120
Yeah, Tracey said.
No distractions.

26:22.400 --> 26:25.880
I'm sorry about what's happened.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.600
Thank you.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.720
And about giving you attitude
over the Clarke stuff.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.200
I was out of line.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.400
I know you're just trying to help.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.520
Has Tony given Clarke
to anyone else yet?

26:41.640 --> 26:43.080
I think he's avoiding me.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.560
You still have prints of the photos
from this website?

26:45.720 --> 26:48.800
Boxes and boxes of them.
Could I borrow them this morning?

26:48.920 --> 26:51.320
And the website address.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.040
This photo was taken near
the lighthouse in point Galloway.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.400
On the South coast?
But I don't know which street,

26:56.520 --> 26:57.880
and I don't know who owns it.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.160
If I find more photos featuring
Ruby moreno and this house,

27:01.320 --> 27:03.880
I may find a way
to identify the exact location.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.120
Caroline Martin
and the police will be able to...

27:06.280 --> 27:09.160
I haven't got time for that.
This house has to belong to moreno.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.160
The person who's hidden the camera

27:11.320 --> 27:13.120
needs constant access
to change batteries.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.640
That camera is taking video
of naked children,

27:15.800 --> 27:18.360
and someone is selling those images
to porn sites.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.840
I know, but...

27:20.000 --> 27:21.960
I'm not asking you
to look at this yourself.

27:22.120 --> 27:25.440
I know it's not appropriate,
given what's happened.

27:25.600 --> 27:29.440
There are tens of thousands of them.
That photo is just the beginning.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.560
That's why I need to start now.

27:34.920 --> 27:38.680
Can you just get me
those boxes of photos, please?

28:50.720 --> 28:53.000
I get more visitors here
than in my office.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.760
Have you got time to listen to
an opening for vasilich?

28:55.880 --> 28:58.280
I'm refuting lurking doubt.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.320
You're stalking renmark?

29:00.480 --> 29:02.840
We're drowning in work,
and you're stalking renmark?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.320
Someone leaned on him.
No.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.200
Danny novak says
someone leaned on him.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.680
There's a big difference.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.440
How else
could he get moreno so wrong?

29:09.560 --> 29:10.920
Past his use-by date.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.280
He's always been pro-prosecution,
you know that.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.800
This is an about-face overnight.

29:14.960 --> 29:18.200
There's no such thing as overnight
in the criminal justice system.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.800
There's months between decisions.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.320
Something's wrong.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.080
Let it go.
No. Can't.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.320
If there's any truth in this, Tony...

29:26.440 --> 29:28.800
Look, you want it to be true

29:28.960 --> 29:31.960
because you think
it takes the pressure off you.

29:32.120 --> 29:37.440
Now, I know it's been difficult
since you've been back.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.040
'Disastrous, ' isn't it,
the word you're reaching for?

29:40.160 --> 29:41.520
This is all going to blow over -

29:41.680 --> 29:44.360
blakely, vasilich,
this impropriety thing.

29:44.520 --> 29:48.120
Some footballer's wife will
get busted for shoplifting,

29:48.240 --> 29:49.920
then suddenly life will be peachy.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.200
Peachy?

29:51.360 --> 29:53.240
I've never used that word
in my life.

29:54.840 --> 29:57.400
You'll want to see this.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.840
Following recent allegations
in the press

30:00.000 --> 30:02.360
about senior crown prosecutor
Janet king,

30:02.480 --> 30:04.480
the government has appointed

30:04.640 --> 30:06.600
recently retired judge
granville renmark

30:06.760 --> 30:09.880
to inquire into the functioning
of the office of the dpp.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.760
He'll be interviewing
past and current staff

30:12.920 --> 30:14.640
of the department
of public prosecutions

30:14.760 --> 30:18.080
and anyone else he thinks relevant.

30:18.240 --> 30:23.320
It is vital this state has a strong
and effective prosecution service.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.000
I've asked the director of the dpp
and his staff to give his honour

30:27.160 --> 30:29.200
their full cooperation
and assistance.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.680
First I've heard of it.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.240
Judge renmark will report
directly to cabinet.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.160
Would it help if
I don't take the job?

30:35.280 --> 30:37.000
You'll take the bloody job.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.200
Renmark. Tell me that's
a coincidence.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.880
Of course Janet knows
I want to be a crown one day.

30:46.040 --> 30:50.040
She's been a sort of unofficial
mentor since I started at the dpp.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.160
And miss king
was on the selection panel?

30:52.280 --> 30:54.520
One of three, yes.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.840
You see each other socially?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.480
Yes. There's nothing
wrong with that, is there?

31:02.120 --> 31:04.160
When did you discover that
you and miss king

31:04.280 --> 31:08.760
shared the same... lifestyle choice?

31:12.240 --> 31:15.840
Which particular choice
are you referring to?

31:16.000 --> 31:21.040
Our shared love of tolstoy?
French films? The Sydney swans?

31:21.200 --> 31:26.520
Unfortunate when our private desires
conflict with our public duties.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.520
You were the one who proposed
the creation of the position

31:31.640 --> 31:33.000
of solicitor advocate?

31:33.120 --> 31:34.480
Yes.

31:34.640 --> 31:38.960
And you created that position
with miss o'shaughnessy in mind?

31:45.280 --> 31:47.960
If you had any sort of relationship

31:48.120 --> 31:50.280
outside the office
with an applicant,

31:50.400 --> 31:52.040
you should have stepped back.

31:53.080 --> 31:57.920
As a crown prosecutor, you're
held to the highest standards.

31:58.080 --> 32:02.160
You must be unimpeachable,
above reproach.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.920
Just like a judge.

32:08.040 --> 32:11.600
Yes, just like a judge.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.440
I'd tread very carefully
if I were you, miss king.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.240
Thank you for the warning,
judge renmark.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.920
Not that way.
There's a mob of reporters.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.400
Thank you.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.280
That beach house
doesn't belong to Alex moreno.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.281
If I wasn't going to look
at the Clarke photos,

32:40.400 --> 32:41.840
I needed to do something.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.320
I tried to think like Richard.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.041
I used the reflection
of the lighthouse.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.880
I measured the angles, narrowed
the location down to a street,

32:49.040 --> 32:51.360
figured it must be one of
the six houses on that street.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.400
They could only be on one side of
the street to catch the reflection.

32:54.560 --> 32:57.240
I did a title search on all six.
And?

32:57.400 --> 33:00.840
No.26 is owned by a company
called blue and white holdings.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.480
The director of that company
is Steven blakely.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.480
Steve blakely knew moreno?
Must have.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.680
I found dozens of photos of naked
children taken in the same house.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.240
The question is, did he know
what moreno was doing there?

33:13.360 --> 33:15.080
There's an easy answer to that - no.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.560
If dianne didn't kill blakely,

33:16.720 --> 33:19.120
we're looking for another murderer,
another motive.

33:19.280 --> 33:22.000
He found out what moreno was doing
and moreno killed him?

33:22.160 --> 33:25.160
Or they were in it together, they
fell out, moreno feared exposure...

33:25.320 --> 33:27.920
Steve blakely's producing porn?
It's possible.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.920
It's also possible that every family
that has stayed in this house

33:31.080 --> 33:33.440
has had photos taken of them
without their knowledge.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.200
Why are you looking at this?
Wild conjecture is my job.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.360
I have found a link
between moreno and blakely.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.200
You don't want to think
you prosecuted the wrong person.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.520
That's not why.
What, then?

33:43.680 --> 33:45.320
Intuition.
Bullshit.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.640
You've got moreno under surveillance.
Maybe you need to do more.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.400
Like what?
I don't know. Something.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.600
I'm not even on the task force
right now.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.200
Tell me who I need to talk to.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.240
Alright. Talk to me, ok?

33:56.400 --> 33:59.440
I want this sorted
just as much as you do.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.840
Fantastic views.

34:05.840 --> 34:09.280
We've been renting it
twice a year during school holidays

34:09.400 --> 34:11.520
for three, maybe four years now.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.400
My daughter loves it.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.400
You rent it through the owner?

34:15.560 --> 34:18.719
Through an agent, a local outfit -
Dunphy's.

34:18.880 --> 34:21.920
Is there a problem with the house?
Something happen?

34:22.080 --> 34:25.000
Perfect place for taking photos.
You do work while you're there?

34:25.120 --> 34:26.880
I don't even take a point-and-shoot.

34:27.040 --> 34:31.760
Don't go in for
the holiday-snap thing.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.239
Video?

34:33.360 --> 34:35.560
Never use it.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.280
October the 9th.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.679
What were you doing that night?

34:42.840 --> 34:47.560
October? It was a fair while ago.
I'm not sure what I was doing.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.040
No idea at all?

34:49.199 --> 34:52.520
No, sorry.
You want to give it some thought?

34:52.639 --> 34:54.000
Ok.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.600
October. Wednesday.

34:57.760 --> 35:00.280
I could have driven down to coogee,
taken the dog for a walk.

35:00.440 --> 35:03.000
I often do that midweek.
On your own?

35:03.120 --> 35:04.880
No, I had the dog with me.

35:07.080 --> 35:10.240
Ok, so the real-estate agency
checks out.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.400
The moreno family stay there
twice a year, pay by credit card.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.040
All above board. We still
have him under surveillance.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.280
So we just wait?

35:19.400 --> 35:20.800
Welcome to my world.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.920
Heard a rumour
you might be interested in.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.800
Apparently, renmark volunteered
himself for the inquiry.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.360
Make of that what you will.

35:30.520 --> 35:34.400
Someone in reception for you -
Maya and drew blakely.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.720
Are they here to see Tony?

35:37.880 --> 35:40.840
I don't think he's expecting them
so soon. I don't think he's here.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.320
I called them in early.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.520
I want to explain why
I won't be handling things.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.520
Should I join you,
explain the approach we're taking?

35:46.680 --> 35:49.160
No need. The intricacies of an appeal
will be lost on them.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.040
I'll just reassure them.
Leave them with me.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.720
We just get shunted
to the next available lawyer,

35:58.840 --> 36:00.520
is that how this works?

36:00.640 --> 36:02.360
I understand how you feel,

36:02.520 --> 36:05.600
but Tony is the most senior advocate
we have at the dpp.

36:05.760 --> 36:08.200
He's highly experienced
at appearance work.

36:08.320 --> 36:09.680
They know what they're doing.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.320
Do the police know
how dad's body got to be out there?

36:12.440 --> 36:13.840
No.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.680
This woman might
be declared innocent?

36:15.840 --> 36:18.600
If her appeal is successful,
it doesn't mean she's innocent.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.040
It means the court doesn't think it
was reasonable

36:21.160 --> 36:22.640
for the jury to convict her.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.080
It turns on a question of doubt.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.800
You don't doubt that she killed dad,
do you?

36:27.920 --> 36:28.960
The only person

36:29.120 --> 36:31.360
who can ever know that without doubt
is dianne vasilich.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.920
I believe the jury
did reach a reasonable verdict

36:35.080 --> 36:38.000
on the facts in front of them
at the time.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.760
She hated dad.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.080
There's no way she'll get off.

36:42.240 --> 36:47.840
It's always a possibility, and you
need to prepare yourselves for that.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.840
Do either of you know

36:52.000 --> 36:55.440
if your father knew a photographer
called Alex moreno?

36:55.560 --> 36:57.640
Not that I know.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.720
Why do you ask?

37:02.200 --> 37:06.080
Do you recognise that bedroom?
Yeah, that's our beach house.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.480
The girl is Alex moreno's daughter.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.400
We believe the photo was taken
with a hidden camera.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.480
The police found the photo
on a porn site.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.080
Someone's making porn
at our beach house?

37:19.200 --> 37:21.400
Yes.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.600
You think our father
had something to do with this?

37:25.720 --> 37:27.080
I don't know.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.240
That house is with an agent.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.440
We only get to use it a couple
of times a year, in the off-season.

37:32.600 --> 37:37.360
Whoever put the camera in needed
constant, easy access to the house.

37:37.480 --> 37:41.160
Did you ask the agent? Did you?

37:41.280 --> 37:43.360
Why should the automatic assumption

37:43.520 --> 37:45.280
be my father had something
to do with this?

37:45.400 --> 37:46.960
It could be anyone.

37:48.320 --> 37:52.160
Let's put it on the dead man.
He's not here to defend himself.

37:52.320 --> 37:56.320
That makes things really neat
and tidy for you, doesn't it?

37:59.080 --> 38:01.240
Is that why
you're not doing the appeal,

38:01.400 --> 38:05.280
because you think that
my father is a child pornographer?

38:05.440 --> 38:10.480
It might not be your father. It might
be someone associated with him.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.440
This is what we're trying
to establish.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.360
Maya?

38:27.080 --> 38:30.240
I just think that
we should just leave...

38:30.400 --> 38:33.200
..We should just leave dad
out of this.

38:37.920 --> 38:39.600
Maybe it was dad.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.280
He, um...

38:42.840 --> 38:46.320
He got me to buy him
a stack of security cameras

38:46.480 --> 38:48.840
through my it company
a couple of years ago.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.600
I got him a trade discount,
gave him the receipts.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.520
I never asked
what he wanted them for.

38:55.680 --> 38:59.200
They could be for anything.
They could be for the police.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.600
Yeah, yeah. I don't know.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.960
Maybe it's cop-related.
I'm just trying to help.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.440
What size were the cameras?

39:07.560 --> 39:10.520
State-of-the-art, and small.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.080
You'd never see them
if you weren't looking for them.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.120
You don't happen to have copies
of the receipts for those, do you?

39:16.280 --> 39:18.760
He was a police officer.
He was very security-conscious.

39:18.920 --> 39:21.680
This doesn't prove anything.
Why can't you just shut up?

39:23.840 --> 39:26.120
Janet. Thanks for explaining things.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.240
Tony gillies,
director of public prosecutions.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.320
I believe you'll be
joining us in court today.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.240
I'm sure Janet's run through
what to expect. Pretty dry stuff.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.600
We shouldn't oppose the appeal.
What?

39:36.760 --> 39:39.160
I'm sure now that dianne vasilich
didn't kill blakely.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.760
Don't spring this sort of shit on me

39:40.920 --> 39:44.160
when I'm about to front up
to the court of criminal appeal.

39:44.320 --> 39:49.080
You know what the chief justice
has done? He's stacked the bench.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.440
Clearly, he's sick
of all the media attention

39:51.560 --> 39:52.920
and political interference.

39:53.080 --> 39:57.120
He wants to make it crystal-clear
to the ag that she has to butt out.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.880
I've got Jonathan macleod,

39:59.040 --> 40:01.200
a judge hell-bent
on abolishing the jury system.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.760
I've got Michael manzarelli,
who I turned down for a job as crown

40:04.920 --> 40:06.520
and Bernie Lane,
a former defence silk.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.840
I mean, it's a total set-up.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.080
So unless you've got
video footage of moreno

40:11.240 --> 40:13.120
with his hand on
a bloody great shovel,

40:13.280 --> 40:15.640
I'm not going to play nicely
with the other children.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.760
In the matter of the appeals

40:44.920 --> 40:47.040
of dianne Mary vasilich
and Brian Patrick Vincent

40:47.200 --> 40:49.520
against the department
of public prosecutions,

40:49.640 --> 40:51.160
an appeal against conviction.

40:53.720 --> 40:56.000
If the court pleases,
Gillian warden.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.880
I appear for the appellant.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.600
Ms warden.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.520
Tony gillies. I appear on behalf
of the respondent.

41:02.680 --> 41:07.080
Mr gillies. No jury here for
you to play to today, I'm afraid.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.560
Your honour.

41:11.080 --> 41:14.600
Your honours, I would like to speak
to the submissions before the court

41:14.720 --> 41:16.360
on behalf of the appellants.

41:16.480 --> 41:17.840
We've all read the submissions.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
You're pushing at an open door,
ms warden.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.680
As your honour pleases.
Your honour, in the submissions

41:22.800 --> 41:24.160
before the court...

41:24.320 --> 41:27.200
If I could stop you there,
mr gillies. Sorry, your honour.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.440
Your submissions were
very comprehensive.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.120
There's no need
for you to elaborate.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.320
If I might, your honour,
raise the issue...

41:33.480 --> 41:35.800
We're in a position
to rule on the appeal today.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.560
We're ready to give our decision now

41:38.720 --> 41:40.920
and our written judgement
will follow.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.160
As your honours please.

41:47.600 --> 41:51.640
Mrs vasilich, mr Vincent,
if you could please stand.

41:54.160 --> 41:57.280
Speaking on behalf
of my brother judges,

41:57.440 --> 42:01.160
we have read the submissions
prepared by counsel on your behalf,

42:01.280 --> 42:03.600
and we hereby allow the appeal.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.760
In relation to one count of murder

42:08.920 --> 42:11.440
and of accessory after the fact
of murder,

42:11.600 --> 42:15.440
we order the convictions be quashed
and an acquittal be entered.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.320
Loathe as I am to interrupt,

42:17.480 --> 42:19.600
if your honours are of a mind
to allow the appeal,

42:19.760 --> 42:21.960
I wish to be heard
on the merit of remitting the case

42:22.080 --> 42:23.640
for retrial to the supreme court.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.680
We've already determined the matter,
mr gillies.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.680
You are free to go.

42:36.200 --> 42:37.680
All rise.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.840
Fuck it.

42:44.080 --> 42:46.880
She paid franzen
to rough blakely up.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.280
I'm arresting her
for conspiracy to murder.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.480
We've got all the evidence we need
for that.

42:51.640 --> 42:55.760
It's a publicity nightmare.
Just let it go. Just drop it.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.280
Well done.

43:23.440 --> 43:27.240
There's some stuff that's been shot
in Steve's beach house

43:27.400 --> 43:31.360
that's somehow found its way
onto a Russian porn site.

43:34.040 --> 43:35.480
Shit.

43:35.600 --> 43:37.320
Drew reckons

43:37.480 --> 43:43.080
Steve bought a couple of dozen tiny
surveillance cameras through him.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.360
The receipts check out.

43:45.520 --> 43:47.480
I mean, these cameras
are just perfect

43:47.640 --> 43:51.000
for spying on little kids
without them knowing.

43:54.160 --> 43:58.200
Don't you just hate it
when all that work you've put in

43:58.360 --> 44:01.800
turns up something
you just didn't want to find?

44:01.960 --> 44:04.360
I'm afraid Janet king gets the prize
for that bit of work.

44:04.480 --> 44:07.520
She's wasted at dpp. Wasted.

44:11.440 --> 44:14.280
Sometimes we see too much.

44:14.440 --> 44:17.000
We get stressed out,
our defences are down.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.440
See these other guys
making all this money,

44:19.600 --> 44:21.760
and we struggle
to pay the mortgage.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.680
Then we realise we've got easy
access to whatever we want -

44:24.800 --> 44:27.800
money, drugs, porn, girls, kids.

44:29.280 --> 44:32.640
I'm not offering excuses...

44:33.640 --> 44:37.400
..I'm just trying to make sense
of how it happens.

44:40.920 --> 44:45.880
Steve's dead,
and all this shit's floating up.

44:48.520 --> 44:51.200
I don't know what to think anymore.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.720
We never did.

44:54.840 --> 44:57.200
Yeah, but Steve?

44:57.320 --> 44:58.960
Now I... I don't...

45:01.080 --> 45:02.560
Fuck.

45:08.040 --> 45:09.440
I've got to piss.

45:16.080 --> 45:18.520
What's your excuse
for leaving so late?

45:18.640 --> 45:20.000
I'm prey for the paparazzi

45:20.160 --> 45:24.040
because I'm a wild lesbian who's
shagging her boss to get ahead.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.600
If only they knew how tragic
my love life really is.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.560
About as tragic
as a crazed solicitor

45:28.720 --> 45:31.240
attacking an innocent man
at a railway station?

45:31.360 --> 45:32.720
Any word about your job?

45:32.840 --> 45:34.200
Too much else going on.

45:34.360 --> 45:35.960
I suppose that's a good thing.
Is it?

45:36.080 --> 45:37.760
Feels like I'm in limbo.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.080
Do you know what you want to happen?

45:41.240 --> 45:44.320
Other than Clarke getting locked
away for life, I don't know.

45:44.480 --> 45:47.800
I don't think I can keep going,
not in that department.

45:49.560 --> 45:53.040
That's the first time
I've said that out loud.

45:53.160 --> 45:56.360
You know, I really terrified myself.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.920
I didn't think I had that in me.

45:59.080 --> 46:01.880
I always suspected
you were ferocious.

46:16.240 --> 46:18.200
Anyone still out there?

46:18.320 --> 46:20.520
Looks like lesbian sex scandals

46:20.680 --> 46:23.760
aren't worth staying out
all night for.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.920
Anyway, we should be celebrating.

46:27.080 --> 46:32.440
It's not every day you get a shiny
new job. I am so proud of you.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.960
I shouldn't be worried, should I?

46:35.120 --> 46:38.360
God, no.
There's a new scandal every day.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.640
Ash, of course not.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.120
I know how flattering it is

46:45.280 --> 46:47.360
when someone young and gorgeous
has a crush on you.

46:47.480 --> 46:49.520
Erin doesn't have a crush on me.

46:49.680 --> 46:53.040
You spend a lot more time with her
than you do with me.

46:54.640 --> 46:57.680
You seriously think
I might do something like that?

46:59.120 --> 47:02.160
I don't know. Don't make me
the bad guy just for asking.

47:02.280 --> 47:04.040
Well, I'm not the bad guy.

47:06.600 --> 47:11.360
We're tired, and the kids...
This is not about being tired.

47:11.520 --> 47:14.680
Maybe in some ways
it is about being tired.

47:14.840 --> 47:18.000
Let's face it, it hasn't exactly
been a sex-fest around here lately.

47:18.160 --> 47:21.240
I am not sleeping with Erin
or anyone else.

47:25.720 --> 47:28.600
I'm sorry.
I wish I'd never said anything.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.240
Come here.
No, no.

47:30.400 --> 47:33.240
Just don't.
Listen.

47:36.600 --> 47:40.000
I would never do anything
to jeopardise us.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.920
You and the kids are my world...

47:45.160 --> 47:47.440
..And you have me completely.

47:48.480 --> 47:49.960
Yes?
Yeah.

47:54.760 --> 47:56.240
Come here.

48:01.600 --> 48:04.080
So much for the stroller theory.

48:05.080 --> 48:07.800
Maybe we could put them in the car,
drive them around a bit?

48:07.920 --> 48:09.680
It's worth a try. Come on.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.920
Let's take the beast.

48:18.080 --> 48:22.000
Why don't we swing by
the gelati place on the way out?

49:32.120 --> 49:33.720
We'll be moving them tonight

49:33.840 --> 49:35.360
to separate safe houses.

52:16.080 --> 52:18.040
I thought I should
make it easy for yuou.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.761
A perfectly honourable
course of action.

52:19.840 --> 52:21.600
I don't trust myself anymore.

52:21.760 --> 52:25.160
I've compiled a list of people who
might hold a grudge against you.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.960
I don't need this. I know who did it.

52:27.120 --> 52:30.680
If I tell you the truth,
no-one needs to know, do they?

52:30.840 --> 52:33.000
Terry renner's looking into
the organised crime...

52:33.160 --> 52:36.560
This has nothing to do with a drug
dealer I put away five years ago.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.720
You don't think it happened?
I don't know.

52:38.880 --> 52:40.400
- I didn't see it.
- It happened!

52:40.560 --> 52:42.520
Both our families
are being attacked by someone.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.600
I just don't know
what his involvement is.

52:44.760 --> 52:47.840
They nearly died because of me
that's all that matters.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.280
Resign now and go back
to private practice.
