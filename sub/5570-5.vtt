WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:02.770
My name is Brian Finch.

00:02.803 --> 00:04.472
I was your average
28-year-old screwup

00:04.505 --> 00:07.208
until I took a pill called NZT.

00:07.241 --> 00:10.678
Suddenly I had access
to every brain cell.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.780
Every time he takes it,
for the next 12 hours,

00:12.813 --> 00:14.348
he basically becomes the
smartest person in the world.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.349
BRIAN:
And that's why
the FBI hired me.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.217
My name's Brian Finch,

00:16.250 --> 00:17.218
this is Rebecca Harris,

00:17.251 --> 00:18.386
and we're with the FBI.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.753
God, that sounds cool.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.722
There's just one problem.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.191
NZT will kill you,

00:23.224 --> 00:25.326
unless you have this shot.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.661
Now you can have as much NZT as
you want with no side effects.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.829
Why would you help me?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.164
Let's just say I need somebody

00:30.198 --> 00:31.165
in your position.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.067
You describe to the FBI,
or anyone,

00:33.101 --> 00:33.934
about these shots...

00:33.967 --> 00:35.569
I will let you die
more painfully

00:35.603 --> 00:37.238
and slowly than you can fathom.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.807
So, Brian, you ready
to become somebody who matters?

00:40.808 --> 00:42.576
Previously on Limitless...

00:42.610 --> 00:45.246
I think my father was
on NZT that night,

00:45.279 --> 00:47.415
and if I can figure out
where it comes from,

00:47.448 --> 00:49.850
maybe I can figure out
what happened to him.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.719
It's time
to make yourself useful.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.488
We know quote a lot about NZT
outside of the fence.

00:54.522 --> 00:55.823
FBI is playing catch-up.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.658
I want you to find out
exactly what they know

00:57.691 --> 00:59.327
and bring it to me.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.494
Your dad made that?

01:00.528 --> 01:01.729
I think my father was taking

01:01.762 --> 01:03.131
NZT before he got killed.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.332
So, if he was finally

01:04.365 --> 01:05.666
painting again, that's why.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.136
BRIAN: If my dad was gone,
and I learned

01:08.169 --> 01:10.638
there was something out there
he had made,

01:10.671 --> 01:12.206
I don't think
I could ignore it.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.687
BRIAN:
Right.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.157
Last night.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.530
Hey, buddy.

01:36.564 --> 01:37.865
Now, don't take this
the wrong way,

01:37.898 --> 01:40.168
but I made you
an instructional video.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.769
Now, I know you remember
most of this stuff.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.171
You are me, after all.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.838
But you're me without NZT.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.640
And let's be honest,

01:46.674 --> 01:48.509
some stuff gets lost
in translation.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.344
So, Rebecca's awesome.

01:50.378 --> 01:54.148
I know this, you know this,
we know this.

01:54.182 --> 01:57.718
And you just learned
the FBI has a file on her dad,

01:57.751 --> 02:00.821
which shows he was using NZT
before he died.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.390
Do you want to tell her?

02:02.423 --> 02:03.857
Of course you do.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.727
You're Mr. Happy Nice Guy.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.530
You want what's best for
everyone, but here's the thing.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.599
And I want to be very clear
about this

02:11.632 --> 02:14.235
so that you can remember it
even without NZT.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.269
*

02:20.908 --> 02:23.911
You stole those files at the
behest of Senator Edward Morra's

02:23.944 --> 02:25.879
minion, I guess you'd call him.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.948
Stealing them was treason.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.217
They put people...

02:29.250 --> 02:30.651
(door buzzes, clanks shut)

02:30.684 --> 02:32.386
...in supermax prison for it.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.422
You have to be very,
very careful.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.325
Let's just say you do tell her.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.294
"Hey, Rebecca,
it just seems fair that we talk

02:40.328 --> 02:42.396
since we're such good friends
and stuff."

02:42.430 --> 02:44.365
Then she wants to know
how you know.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.934
She doesn't believe your excuse,
and you wind up...

02:46.967 --> 02:49.470
(door buzzes, clanks shut)
...in supermax prison.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.805
Don't believe
she'll turn you in? Fine.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.642
"Hey, Rebecca, I know you won't
do anything compromising

02:54.675 --> 02:56.610
"with the information
I just handed you

02:56.644 --> 02:58.912
because we're such good friends
and stuff."

02:58.946 --> 03:02.816
But then she gets so mad
that she confronts her boss.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.419
And you wind up in--
you guessed it--

03:05.453 --> 03:08.289
(door buzzes, clanks shut)
...supermax prison.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.324
You know what happens
in supermax prison?

03:11.792 --> 03:15.329
Probably not death
by giant boot.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.998
Of course,
if Mr. Sands finds out

03:18.031 --> 03:20.834
that you told your FBI BFF

03:20.868 --> 03:22.403
about the secret mission
he gave you,

03:22.436 --> 03:24.872
you will be praying
for death by giant boot.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.541
* Mr. Sandman,
bring me a dream *

03:27.575 --> 03:30.311
* Bum, bum, bum, bum *
* Make him the cutest...

03:30.344 --> 03:32.880
Look, you're in the middle
of a very dangerous situation

03:32.913 --> 03:34.682
with a number of potentially
awful outcomes,

03:34.715 --> 03:37.451
but we can get through it.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.253
I can get us through it.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.187
But only if you listen.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.324
You can't be
Mr. Happy Nice Guy anymore.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.459
You got to be Badass Brian.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.960
Badass Brian
keeps his secrets private.

03:46.994 --> 03:50.398
Badass Brian looks out for
himself, and most importantly,

03:50.431 --> 03:55.536
when all this is over,
Badass Brian gets to walk away,

03:55.569 --> 03:57.471
free and alive.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.972
Something wrong?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.975
No. All good. Bottoms up.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.978
BRIAN: So I sat there waiting
for the pill to kick in,

04:05.012 --> 04:07.448
and I started to wonder.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.483
Pill Brian is leaving
instructions for me now.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.385
It sounded like he thought

04:11.419 --> 04:13.387
he was talking
to a different person,

04:13.421 --> 04:15.022
and I don't like that.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.358
And should I even
listen to him?

04:17.391 --> 04:19.927
Rebecca deserves to know
the truth about her father.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.296
But when the pill kicked in,

04:22.330 --> 04:24.432
I did start to see
all the angles.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.734
And he had some good points.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.868
*

04:32.506 --> 04:33.907
REBECCA (echoing):
Brian?

04:33.941 --> 04:34.975
Brian?

04:35.008 --> 04:37.545
We've been talking to you
for, like, 30 seconds,

04:37.578 --> 04:39.713
and you're nodding your
head, but it doesn't really

04:39.747 --> 04:40.848
feel like you're listening.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.016
No. I'm sorry. I was thinking
about something else.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.552
Okay, we'll repeat
ourselves.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.354
BRIAN:
No need. I mean, I wasn't

04:46.387 --> 04:48.989
paying attention in the moment,
but, you know, perfect recall.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.760
(whooshing)

04:52.793 --> 04:54.495
The CJC is working
with Narcotics

04:54.528 --> 04:57.097
to augment an investigation into
a ring of meth labs, but...

04:57.130 --> 04:58.332
(whooshing)

04:58.366 --> 04:59.667
Most of the labs
are upstate,

04:59.700 --> 05:01.034
but we got a tip
that there's one

05:01.068 --> 05:03.404
in an L.E.S.
housing project.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.372
REBECCA:
We're headed there

05:04.405 --> 05:05.373
with SWAT and
Narcotics,

05:05.406 --> 05:06.073
but you're coming along

05:06.106 --> 05:08.409
to work the Thunderbolt Bravo.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.443
We're going
to the Lower East Side.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.811
We're looking
for a meth lab.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.480
And I'm operating
the Thunderbolt Bravo?

05:12.513 --> 05:13.947
What's that?

05:13.981 --> 05:17.385
That's it?
It just tracks cell phones?

05:17.418 --> 05:18.619
MAN: This is
state-of-the-art surveillance,

05:18.652 --> 05:20.854
with horizontal and
vertical mapping.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.791
We can ping any cell phone
around here, on or off.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.394
Cool. Well, you obviously vibe
with the machine.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.696
You know how it works.
What am I doing here?

05:28.729 --> 05:30.998
We don't know which number
we're looking for.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.100
The informant said
the lab is in that building.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.769
There are 400 units.
That could be over 1,000 cells.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.671
Sifting through data quickly
is kind of your thing.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.940
We want to know if one of
those numbers stands out.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.942
You said
the other labs are upstate?

05:41.975 --> 05:43.076
Yes.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.380
Okay.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.849
Well...

05:48.882 --> 05:52.420
there are three cell phones
from area code 315 in there.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.821
That's Utica.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.055
MAN:
How'd you do that?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.690
The numbers haven't even
finished aggregating.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.059
There's a 928 area code, also.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.429
Arizona.
More precisely, that's Yuma.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.096
And I read in one of
the informant's files

06:03.130 --> 06:04.565
that he used to travel

06:04.598 --> 06:06.400
up there when he worked
for these dealers.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.901
So if that number crosses
with a Utica number,

06:07.935 --> 06:08.902
then odds are that's...

06:08.936 --> 06:10.103
House eight,
unit 3-R.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.906
Wait, wait, wait!
I just sit here?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.041
(door closes)

06:14.074 --> 06:15.876
(sighs)

06:15.909 --> 06:17.711
We don't know exactly
what to expect in there,

06:17.745 --> 06:21.415
but SWAT has point at all times,
all right? Let's go.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.016
So, do you have to pay
for these cranberry juices,

06:23.050 --> 06:24.818
or does the FBI
buy them for you?

06:24.852 --> 06:26.587
You may want to
go easy on that.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.922
Bladder management's kind of
a big thing in surveillance.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.593
Ha! Well, staying hydrated is
kind of a big thing in life.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.496
Plus, I have impeccable control
over my bodily functions.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.415
*

07:25.245 --> 07:26.980
(alarm blaring)

07:27.014 --> 07:28.849
All right, I got to go.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.518
Don't go in the building.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.828
Trip wire!

07:45.065 --> 07:46.767
(officers shouting)

07:50.704 --> 07:52.039
Someone must have
tipped them off.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.641
They couldn't have
gotten far.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.808
Sweep the building!
We need people

07:54.842 --> 07:56.109
in the stairwells
and the streets.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.277
Now!

07:57.310 --> 07:58.846
(officers shouting)

08:05.318 --> 08:07.154
Don't move?
Get out of my way.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.856
Listen, I'm with the FBI.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.024
If you're mixed up in the meth
thing, it's better not to run,

08:11.058 --> 08:12.159
I promise.
Where's your gun?

08:12.192 --> 08:14.628
Listen to me.
Do not run away, man.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.597
Then you're a fugitive,
and things will end

08:16.630 --> 08:17.798
really bad for you.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.166
Look, I didn't do
anything wrong.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.034
That's great.
More reason to stay here.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.270
Look, I can help you.
Move.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.839
Ah, ah, ah!
Look, if you're
trying to stop me

08:25.873 --> 08:28.275
and you don't have a gun,
you better know how to fight.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.078
Well, I do have perfect recall.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.187
Stop!

08:41.722 --> 08:43.290
Get the restraints on him;
we need to search

08:43.323 --> 08:44.858
the rest of the building.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.894
(groaning)

08:46.927 --> 08:51.098
I don't get it. I've seen Enter
the Dragon, like, 15 times.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.670
Yeah, well, at least
I slowed him down for you guys.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.672
You're welcome.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.733
Not sure he could hear me
through the ringing in his ears,

09:25.766 --> 09:27.134
but, yeah,
he's gonna be okay.
And you?

09:27.167 --> 09:30.370
I'm fine.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.774
Little pissed off at Bruce Lee
right now, but I'm good.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.976
NAZ: Next time, maybe
you should monitor

09:36.009 --> 09:37.611
your cranberry
juice consumption.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.179
You know, that said, we
can't have you running

09:39.212 --> 09:40.914
out of the building
without proper training,

09:40.948 --> 09:43.984
so I'm gonna have you run
a SWAT self-defense course.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.720
Rooks, you can get him
up to speed on that.

09:46.754 --> 09:47.755
And what about the
kid we brought in

09:47.788 --> 09:49.723
from the Lower East Side?

09:49.757 --> 09:52.092
His name is Christopher
Garper. He's 20.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.794
No priors.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.228
He claims that he never
went into the apartment,

09:55.262 --> 09:57.364
that he just followed his
brother into the building,

09:57.397 --> 09:59.332
and security footage
confirms his story.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.835
That's Chris Garper's
brother, Sam,

10:01.869 --> 10:03.003
walking in with Norris Allen,

10:03.036 --> 10:04.672
the occupant
of the unit we raided.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.107
This is about 20 minutes
before we got there.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.744
Their guests from Yuma and Utica
arrive a couple minutes

10:10.778 --> 10:12.112
after Garper and Allen.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.715
And last of all, Chris Garper.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.150
REBECCA: Getting back
to the occupant, Norris Allen.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.819
I looked into
his criminal records.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.353
Yeah, he did time for arson,

10:20.387 --> 10:22.690
and he joined up
with the Sons

10:22.723 --> 10:24.658
of Nathan Bedford Forrest
when he was in jail.

10:24.692 --> 10:27.327
He was also thrown into
solitary for rigging up a bomb

10:27.360 --> 10:29.329
with stuff he stole
from a janitor.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.998
The Sons
of Nathan Bedford Forrest

10:31.031 --> 10:32.666
call themselves a militia.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.434
These are not drug dealers.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.369
We don't think this
is a drug deal.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.805
Chemicals used

10:37.838 --> 10:39.873
to synthesize meth
can also be used

10:39.907 --> 10:41.108
to make explosives.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.876
They're planning on
something in New York.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.712
BOYLE:
They refer to our city

10:44.745 --> 10:47.848
as "Sodom" on their
chat boards, so yeah.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.683
I'm looping in the
Counterterror SAC

10:49.717 --> 10:51.719
so we can check
any recent chatter.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.021
What does the kid
in custody say?

10:54.054 --> 10:55.188
He say anything?

10:55.222 --> 10:56.957
BOYLE: So far, nothing;
he won't talk to us.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.826
He won't talk
to me or Boyle.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.895
There's only one person
he asked to see.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.075
Face okay?

11:15.108 --> 11:17.010
Pretty much.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.346
Thrown that punch
a few times, huh?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.048
Just when I need to.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.916
So why'd you ask to see me?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.351
To apologize.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.353
Sorry.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.756
What, you think that's
gonna get you off the hook?

11:28.789 --> 11:29.757
I don't know.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.924
I thought you
seemed cool.

11:30.958 --> 11:34.194
Guess I was wrong.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.797
Look, I told them, I only ran
because I freaked out.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.265
I got nothing to do with this.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.800
Well, that's what I'm here
to figure out.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.069
They say if I don't want
to do a bunch of time,

11:42.102 --> 11:44.004
I have to tell them
all about my brother.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.739
What are you gonna do?

11:45.773 --> 11:47.908
I don't even know
what I can tell you.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.843
I have no idea
where Sam is.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.745
But I know that
he's not a terrorist.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.781
He goes on Web sites,

11:53.814 --> 11:56.349
pops off about
the government--

11:56.383 --> 11:58.085
that's all just noise.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.088
Well, you followed him into that
building for a reason, Chris.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.823
You must think
he's up to something.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.258
Sam wouldn't
kill people.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.027
All right?
He's a good person.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.097
He's been watching out
for me since I was 16.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.399
What about your parents?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.773
If I talk to you,
I want you to help him

12:19.807 --> 12:21.975
the same way you guys
said you'd help me.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.277
Only I don't think

12:24.311 --> 12:27.080
that I know anything
that's gonna help you.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.917
You might know
more than you think you do.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.518
Tell me about him.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.120
What, just, like, talk?

12:38.859 --> 12:41.328
I mean, he's Sam.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.262
You know?

12:42.295 --> 12:45.232
Everybody thinks he's
this big, tough...

12:45.265 --> 12:47.835
BRIAN:
Did I believe Sam was innocent?

12:47.868 --> 12:50.570
Well, I believe
Chris believed it.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.440
They were brothers.
They did brother stuff.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.375
I got two older brothers.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.844
Youngest brother,
growing up in a big family--

12:56.877 --> 12:58.145
it's not a good spot to be.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.380
I mean, I could relate,
to a point.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.149
Especially after
my mother passed.
What happened to your mom?

13:02.182 --> 13:04.985
Chris told me how he and Sam
lost their mom to cancer,

13:05.018 --> 13:07.020
and how her death
drove their dad to drink.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.488
CHRIS: My brother took it
the hardest...

13:08.521 --> 13:10.090
BRIAN: Which led to them
losing him, too.

13:10.123 --> 13:10.924
CHRIS:
It was bad.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.259
BRIAN:
By the time we were done,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.094
I was an expert in Sam Garper.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.562
(tapping keyboard rapidly)

13:19.266 --> 13:21.468
Hey. So the guy...

13:21.501 --> 13:23.937
whose apartment we raided,

13:23.971 --> 13:26.073
Norris Allen--
we've got his picture out

13:26.106 --> 13:28.308
to everyone who carries
a badge in this city.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.010
And, uh, Counterterror
has someone undercover

13:30.043 --> 13:31.311
with ties to the group

13:31.344 --> 13:33.480
Sons of Nathan, so we'll
see what they can pick up

13:33.513 --> 13:34.547
about the plan.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.316
Amazing.
(continues tapping keyboard)

13:36.349 --> 13:38.085
You've been up to something.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.953
Yeah, I talked to Chris Garper
about his brother

13:39.987 --> 13:41.588
for, like, three hours today.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.591
I got everything
Sam was into,

13:44.624 --> 13:46.894
from Aquaman to Zeppelin.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.361
Well, it's pretty.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.596
Thank you.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.432
You know, Chris also told me
that he knows his brother has

13:52.465 --> 13:54.567
an e-mail account
he keeps secret from Chris.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.905
He saw Sam closing out of it in
a hurry a few different times.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.640
If Sam is communicating with
a hate group, stands to reason

14:00.673 --> 14:02.209
he's using the secret account.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.011
I figure the user name
and password

14:04.044 --> 14:06.213
is... some combination

14:06.246 --> 14:09.349
of this, at one of
the major free e-mail sites.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.885
REBECCA: That's quite a few
possible e-mail accounts.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.021
BRIAN:
Just north of 20,000 so far.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.588
But I'm running out of NZT,

14:15.622 --> 14:17.657
so I'm outsourcing the rest
to Cyber,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.993
and they'll run possibilities
all night.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.361
Whew!

14:21.394 --> 14:23.096
Oh, hey.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.965
You had mentioned
you stopped by that gallery

14:24.998 --> 14:26.333
to see your dad's paintings
the other night?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.936
Yeah.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.505
So... seeing all that work
you didn't know he did--

14:32.539 --> 14:34.607
that's got to give you
a real sense of...

14:34.641 --> 14:36.043
closure?

14:37.444 --> 14:39.646
Um...

14:39.679 --> 14:42.582
actually, it made me curious.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.385
I don't know why,
but I always assumed

14:45.418 --> 14:47.520
that he'd only used
NZT the one time

14:47.554 --> 14:50.090
that he came to
see me, but...

14:50.123 --> 14:53.293
I saw these paintings, and...

14:53.326 --> 14:55.128
they're incredible.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.232
They moved me. I...

14:59.266 --> 15:02.302
There was a part of me
that was thinking I'd be okay

15:02.335 --> 15:03.971
never knowing
what happened to him.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.340
But... now I don't know
if I ever will be.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.176
So...

15:09.209 --> 15:10.643
good night.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.644
Yeah.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.680
BRIAN (over video):
Okay, so we went ahead

15:13.713 --> 15:15.148
and asked Rebecca
about her dad.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.449
The intentions were good.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.186
I wanted you to know
that she had moved on.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.720
The outcome?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.522
(whispers):
Not so good.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.558
So, since you're not on NZT,
and you're therefore subject

15:25.592 --> 15:28.695
to all kinds of unruly,
emotionally driven altruism,

15:28.728 --> 15:30.697
I thought a pie chart
might help.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.666
Now, I do recognize that
this leaves out the possibility

15:33.700 --> 15:36.236
of a supermax prison, but...

15:36.269 --> 15:40.207
for purposes of this chart,
supermax equals death.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.944
(man clears throat)

15:46.013 --> 15:48.048
(sighs)
Don't you guys ever knock?

15:48.081 --> 15:49.716
I'm supposed
to take you to training.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.121
BRIAN:
I can be really annoying

15:54.154 --> 15:55.422
when I'm on NZT.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.124
We've noticed.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.494
*

16:11.771 --> 16:14.707
BRIAN: Okay, you know that
cool kid in junior high school

16:14.741 --> 16:17.777
who somehow had, like,
three black belts already?

16:17.810 --> 16:20.013
No, not me.

16:20.047 --> 16:23.250
Him. Pretty sure that kid
grew up to be Casey Rooks.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.985
And if anyone can make me
a badass, it's him.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.090
Don't get into a fight.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.091
Okay.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.092
If you do get
into a fight,

16:32.125 --> 16:34.494
take it to the ground,
get on top of the guy,

16:34.527 --> 16:36.729
isolate one of his limbs,
and make it bend the wrong way

16:36.763 --> 16:39.366
until he doesn't want
to fight anymore.
Okay.

16:39.399 --> 16:42.335
Either that or... you can choke
him out till he falls asleep.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.736
Wow. Okay.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.605
What I just told you
takes about ten years

16:45.638 --> 16:46.706
to learn how to do well.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.208
But if you know even a little,

16:48.241 --> 16:50.477
you'll be able to take care
of yourself, all right?

16:50.510 --> 16:51.744
Come on, now.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.480
BRIAN: He explained
that the human body

16:53.513 --> 16:56.316
is a series
of strong and weak points.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.652
You can go after an elbow,
(buzzing)

16:59.686 --> 17:01.488
a knee, an ankle.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.357
And it all made sense--
in theory anyway.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.825
And if Bruce Lee
taught me anything,

17:05.858 --> 17:07.594
it's that I needed
to unlearn everything.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.362
What better time than on NZT?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.564
If I can control which
way you're looking,

17:11.598 --> 17:13.233
I control your
whole body.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.068
BRIAN:
Right. (groans)

17:15.102 --> 17:17.137
Can you move? Right.
(groans): No.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.171
Guys?

17:18.838 --> 17:20.540
I need Brian.
Harris.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.075
You haven't been out
on the mats in a while.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.811
(groans)

17:24.844 --> 17:25.812
(exhales)

17:25.845 --> 17:27.780
Hey, you came here
with no ego.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.316
You did a good job.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.818
Run this two mornings a week,
all right?

17:31.851 --> 17:33.052
All right.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.256
How'd that go?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.225
Learn anything
you didn't expect to?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.793
That that guy is
way cooler than me.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.596
You know, the e-mail handles
that you gave Cyber--

17:43.630 --> 17:46.166
well, they ran them,
and they found one account

17:46.199 --> 17:49.136
that was totally empty,
except for a drafts folder.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.870
That's where we found these.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.305
BRIAN:
Huh.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.474
So, what do a cat, a spaceship

17:54.507 --> 17:57.477
and Jack Black
have to do with terrorism?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.713
That's Paul Revere.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.883
And terrorist groups
have been known

18:03.916 --> 18:06.119
to encrypt information
into data files.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.320
It's basic steganography.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.722
We think Sam Garper
is sharing his account

18:09.756 --> 18:12.425
with another user,
presumably Norris Allen,

18:12.459 --> 18:13.826
and they're using
the drafts folder

18:13.860 --> 18:15.762
to avoid a trail.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.834
Allen's address,
where the raid was.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.870
300 Cortlandt Street?
Exactly.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.242
November 20-- that's
two days from now.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.547
1214 Monroe Street, Queens?

18:34.581 --> 18:36.216
It's a hospital.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.550
WOMAN:
I'll tell security

18:37.584 --> 18:39.219
to keep an eye out for
anything suspicious,

18:39.252 --> 18:40.353
but it's been quiet.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.322
Can we check
if any patients

18:42.355 --> 18:44.424
matching these descriptions
have been admitted

18:44.457 --> 18:45.725
in the last 48 hours?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.594
Yes, of course.
Thank you.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.862
You think
this is the target?

18:49.896 --> 18:51.831
Maybe.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.267
Can't assume anything.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.642
What are you looking for?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.744
Can we get a list
of everyone

19:04.777 --> 19:06.246
who has access
to this storeroom?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.348
WOMAN: Sure. We do change
the combination weekly,

19:08.381 --> 19:10.183
per federal regulations.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.852
Is it 8-2-7-3-5-1-2-3-5?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.390
It's written on the doorjamb.
If I had to memorize

19:17.424 --> 19:18.858
a nine-digit code,
I'd cheat, too.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.361
Do you mind?
Please.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.335
(beep)

19:32.572 --> 19:35.375
The chemicals used
in cancer treatment

19:35.408 --> 19:38.211
can transform a bomb into RDD,
which is exactly

19:38.245 --> 19:41.047
why rooms like this
have to be secured.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.819
Is there an issue?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.588
The seal is broken.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.223
It's empty.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.491
BRIAN:
RDD?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.460
REBECCA:
Radiological Dispersion Device.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.728
Looks like Sam Garper's
building a dirty bomb.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.770
The hospital's security footage

20:03.803 --> 20:05.572
puts Sam Garper
in the radiology wing

20:05.605 --> 20:07.607
36 hours ago.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.808
According to
Sacred Heart,

20:08.841 --> 20:11.411
they're missing five
units of Iridium-192.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.846
MAN:
Combine that with the explosive
chems they've already got,

20:13.880 --> 20:15.982
we're looking at a sizeable
contamination zone.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.851
BRIAN: The worst part of this
job is learning about things

20:18.885 --> 20:21.254
you never knew
you needed to worry about.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.923
For instance,
weapons of mass disruption.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.825
Sounds like
a really bad band name.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.328
It's what my bosses call RDDs.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.962
Now, we all know
radiation is bad,

20:29.996 --> 20:32.899
but with an RDD, the poisoning
is almost besides the point.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.034
(people screaming)
The point is the panic.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.937
People flood the hospitals,
transportation shuts down,

20:37.970 --> 20:39.539
businesses close.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.941
By the time the blast site
is decontaminated,

20:41.974 --> 20:43.610
the city's economy
is destroyed.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.678
The whole infrastructure
falls apart.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.246
(crowd clamoring)

20:49.048 --> 20:51.017
NAZ:
Are you listening to me, Brian?

20:51.050 --> 20:52.352
Brian!

20:52.385 --> 20:54.721
No. Sorry. Uh, what's up?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.556
I want you to go
talk to Chris Garper.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.558
He must be upset
about his brother.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.793
You mean that he's
a possible terrorist?

21:00.827 --> 21:01.928
He doesn't know yet.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.598
You want me to tell him.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.534
I'll go with you.
No, no, no, no, no.
You can observe.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.068
Finch has already won
the kid's trust.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.471
If there's anything
Chris Garper hasn't told us

21:11.504 --> 21:13.573
about his brother, there's
a better chance he'll crack

21:13.606 --> 21:15.975
if you're alone.
I'm not gonna try to crack him.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.479
Look, the kid
is already gonna be so crushed.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.414
Sam's the kid I care about.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.882
The one with the bomb.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.453
Go.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.460
That's your brother.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.466
He's stealing
radioactive chemicals.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.334
Now, I know you thought
he was someone different,

21:41.368 --> 21:43.670
but your brother's planning
to kill people.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.472
A lot of them.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.039
CHRIS: No. This is...
this is him pushing a trash can.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.041
This doesn't tell me anything.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.978
You remember Sam's e-mail
address that you told us about?

21:52.011 --> 21:55.648
These are some of the messages
that were in his drafts folder,

21:55.682 --> 21:57.984
and they show how that group
slowly recruited him

21:58.017 --> 21:59.586
into doing this.

21:59.619 --> 22:02.522
But he is doing this.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.358
I'm sorry to put it this way,
but it's a terrorist attack.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.731
Read the e-mails, Chris.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.802
You thought Sam was
a different kind of guy

22:15.835 --> 22:16.903
when we started talking,

22:16.936 --> 22:21.007
so... maybe there's something
you didn't tell me.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.577
Maybe you know a way
to stop this from happening.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.754
I don't even know
my own brother, man.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.592
What do you want me to tell you?

22:39.626 --> 22:43.796
Look, if there's nothing,
there's nothing.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.065
Chris, I believe you.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.100
Whatever they're planning,

22:48.134 --> 22:50.102
we think it's happening
in about two days.

22:50.136 --> 22:53.105
So if you do remember something
and you want to talk,

22:53.139 --> 22:55.708
I'll be here.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.951
Brian...
Look,

23:04.984 --> 23:06.819
what does Naz want me to do,
torture him?

23:06.853 --> 23:07.820
He doesn't know anything.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.155
I know.
I was watching.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.524
I'm checking on you.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.426
Well, I just told that guy
that his brother

23:13.460 --> 23:14.661
is an aspiring mass murderer.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.763
Practically heard
his heart snap.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.165
I saw.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.266
Chris knows the truth now.

23:20.299 --> 23:23.202
It may be hard to take, but...
it's better to know,

23:23.235 --> 23:25.438
right?

23:32.044 --> 23:33.179
Hey, Rebecca.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.126
Never mind.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.162
See you tomorrow.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.970
BRIAN:
So Pill-Brian doesn't want me
to tell Rebecca the truth

23:58.004 --> 24:00.507
about the NZT file. Fine.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.809
He never said I can't
dig into it on my own.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.144
(door closes)

24:05.177 --> 24:07.179
(quiet clattering)

24:09.181 --> 24:11.117
You better not have broken
into my place again.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.185
CASEY:
Um, you gave me a key,

24:13.219 --> 24:15.522
remember?

24:15.555 --> 24:17.857
Who'd you think I was?

24:17.890 --> 24:20.126
You get a lot of men
breaking in here?

24:20.159 --> 24:22.729
Don't worry about it.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.130
Hmm.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.265
I got the good stuff.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.568
I've got to be ready to go in,
in case something breaks

24:28.601 --> 24:29.936
on the Sam Garper case.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.241
How did training go today?

24:35.274 --> 24:38.110
First time. Your guy did fine.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.513
He didn't ask about
you and me, did he?

24:40.547 --> 24:42.949
Why would he? We were grappling.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.617
I don't know. He's sharp.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.219
I wouldn't want him
to figure out that we're dating.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.556
What's the deal with this kid?

24:49.589 --> 24:51.924
He, um...

24:53.926 --> 24:56.729
We both knew there'd be stuff
we couldn't talk about, so...

24:56.763 --> 24:58.064
let's just leave it
at that.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.232
Yeah. I'm happy
to leave work at the door,

25:00.266 --> 25:02.034
but what do you want me to say

25:02.068 --> 25:03.202
if Finch asks about us?

25:03.235 --> 25:05.304
Well, we have to dodge it.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.306
We haven't signed
the HR forms yet.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.609
Right. Because this isn't
at the HR form stage yet.

25:09.642 --> 25:12.111
Can we stop talking
about human resources now?

25:12.144 --> 25:14.246
Yeah. Done.
(laughs)

25:17.183 --> 25:19.185
SANDS:
Quick question.

25:23.289 --> 25:27.126
Why is there a clay effigy of me
on your coffee table?

25:27.159 --> 25:28.795
You?

25:28.828 --> 25:30.630
That's Charles Barkley.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.203
I told you
to get some good scotch.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.939
Yeah, well, that was the most
expensive bottle they had.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.174
You can't get your single malt
at the bodega.

25:45.177 --> 25:48.247
That phone number I gave you,
it's for emergencies.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.515
You and Edward Morra.

25:49.548 --> 25:53.152
You guys know a lot more about
NZT than the FBI does, right?

25:53.185 --> 25:55.287
So, those files
I stole for you,

25:55.321 --> 25:58.658
there's something in there
that I want to learn more about.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.661
The woman I work with at the FBI
is Rebecca Harris.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.262
They have a file on her father.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.664
He was using NZT,

26:04.697 --> 26:05.932
and then he
got murdered.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.034
You haven't said anything
to her, have you?

26:08.067 --> 26:09.035
No, of course not.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.370
But if I can find out
what happened to him,

26:11.403 --> 26:12.972
maybe there's a way
I can let her know

26:13.005 --> 26:15.041
without telling her
what's in the files.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.843
Look, if you
know anything,

26:16.876 --> 26:17.944
just tell me.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.145
Wh-What do you care?

26:19.178 --> 26:21.147
About Rebecca Harris's dad?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.149
I don't.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.952
And neither should you.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.787
Is this woman
a distraction for you?

26:27.820 --> 26:29.121
(chuckles):
What?

26:29.155 --> 26:30.723
No.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.358
Are we going to have
to arrange for you

26:32.391 --> 26:33.893
to work with someone different?

26:33.926 --> 26:34.894
No.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.195
It's not like that.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.330
I haven't talked to her
about anything.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.167
Even so, we can't have
some misguided loyalty

26:41.200 --> 26:44.336
distracting you from the real
reason you're at the FBI.

26:44.370 --> 26:45.905
It's not. We're fine.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.707
Rebecca and I are fine.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.175
Forget I said anything.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.178
Mr. Morra and I don't keep track
of every junkie

26:52.211 --> 26:54.947
who manages to get his hands
on NZT.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.985
I never heard
of Conrad Harris

26:59.018 --> 27:00.853
until you put that file
in my hand.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.724
Use that number sparingly, yeah?

27:09.128 --> 27:10.730
How's your dad, by the way?

27:13.099 --> 27:16.102
He get out of the hospital okay?

27:19.972 --> 27:21.941
(door opens, closes)

27:21.974 --> 27:23.342
Maybe I was right.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.211
I mean,
maybe Pill-Brian was right.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.779
We were right? Whatever.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.983
I tried to help Rebecca,

27:31.017 --> 27:32.852
and instead
I almost got us split up.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.889
No more Mr. Happy Nice Guy.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.825
I have to be Badass Brian.

27:43.029 --> 27:46.265
Badass Brian
keeps his secrets private.

27:46.298 --> 27:49.235
Badass Brian looks out
for himself.

27:49.268 --> 27:52.404
And when all this is over,
Badass Brian

27:52.438 --> 27:56.142
gets out of this
free and alive.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.946
Chris. What are you doing here?

27:59.979 --> 28:01.781
I got to talk
to you, man.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.215
About an hour ago, he called me.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.284
Sam called me.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.086
I think I know where he is.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.127
Sam had this bag
stashed at our place.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.964
He wanted me to grab it,
then wait for his call.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.132
He said he's got
money in it,

28:20.166 --> 28:22.334
and whatever the
hell that stuff is.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.405
I read about that thing

28:26.438 --> 28:28.474
that he's building,
and it says that the people

28:28.507 --> 28:31.477
who put it together
and who set it off,

28:31.510 --> 28:33.846
that they get worse
poison than anybody.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.915
I mean,
he's gonna die.

28:35.948 --> 28:39.285
Sam's gonna kill a bunch
of people, and he's gonna die.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.855
What happened
to my brother?

28:42.889 --> 28:44.857
Why's he doing this?

28:44.891 --> 28:46.292
I don't know, Chris.

28:46.325 --> 28:49.962
I think usually people
that join groups like that,

28:49.996 --> 28:52.131
they're looking for
some kind of purpose.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.302
I sort of feel like
I did this to him, you know?

28:56.335 --> 28:57.469
What do you mean?

28:57.503 --> 28:59.071
Sam dropped out
so I could

28:59.105 --> 29:00.372
go to school.

29:00.406 --> 29:03.109
I got the diploma,
and he got... what?

29:03.142 --> 29:04.977
Look, I know
you already know this,

29:05.011 --> 29:06.478
but whatever Sam did for you,

29:06.512 --> 29:10.216
it doesn't make
what he's doing now okay.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.052
You understand,
I take that call,

29:13.085 --> 29:15.021
let you guys follow me,

29:15.054 --> 29:18.357
I'm turning in my brother.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.059
You got brothers.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.094
How would that
make you feel?

29:22.128 --> 29:25.431
Can't even imagine.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.467
Look, I need to know
what you can do for Sam.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.337
He's done bad things.
He's got to go to jail.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.472
But he's not a terrorist yet.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.876
Is there, like, a program
that you can get him in?

29:36.909 --> 29:39.912
Maybe he can get his
diploma while he does time.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.114
I don't think so,
but I'll check.

29:42.148 --> 29:44.851
NAZ: What exactly
does he expect from us?

29:44.884 --> 29:46.886
I don't know.
But I do know

29:46.919 --> 29:49.055
that we're asking him
to turn in his own brother.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.256
So there has to be something
we can give.

29:50.289 --> 29:54.026
Do you know what's in that
backpack that Sam Garper wants?

29:54.060 --> 29:55.995
Beryllium powder.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.997
He needs it to finish the bomb
he's building

29:58.030 --> 30:01.167
that will render some chunk
of this city uninhabitable.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.470
People will die,
others will get sick,

30:04.503 --> 30:08.841
and it will all be to advance
the cause of hate and nihilism.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.043
There are no reform schools
for people planning

30:11.077 --> 30:12.544
what Sam Garper
is planning.

30:12.578 --> 30:15.114
There's no second chance
for people who rig trip wires

30:15.147 --> 30:16.415
to kill my agents.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.418
I don't know
how Chris will react to that.

30:19.451 --> 30:22.088
Well, we can't give him
the chance to react to it.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.590
So you want me to lie to him.

30:24.623 --> 30:27.193
He has to get to that meeting
with his brother,

30:27.226 --> 30:29.028
and I want you to think about

30:29.061 --> 30:31.864
what will happen
if he doesn't.

30:31.898 --> 30:35.067
You can think of it as a
math problem if you have to.

30:35.101 --> 30:37.069
However you get there,

30:37.103 --> 30:41.440
you have to tell Chris Garper
what he needs to hear.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.275
Okay.

30:43.309 --> 30:47.179
If I have to do this,
I want my pill first.

30:48.614 --> 30:52.551
I'm better at crunching numbers
when I'm on NZT.

30:52.584 --> 30:55.922
To the benefits
of being a badass.

31:00.626 --> 31:01.593
Hey, bud.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.262
So what'd
you find out?

31:03.295 --> 31:04.630
Can you help Sam?

31:04.663 --> 31:06.098
As a matter of fact,

31:06.132 --> 31:07.599
we ca help Sam.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.535
Did I pull it off?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.571
I made federal prison sound
like a California vacation.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.140
*

31:14.173 --> 31:17.209
In my head, I made Mike and Ike
the prison guards.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.211
You get the metaphor.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.380
Anyway, they were all
gonna have so much fun.

31:21.413 --> 31:25.051
And Sam wasn't just gonna
get a high school diploma,

31:25.084 --> 31:28.420
he was being set up
for a life of success.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.555
(paparazzi clamoring)

31:29.588 --> 31:32.324
Did I lay it on a little thick?

31:32.358 --> 31:34.360
Maybe.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.662
But whatever I had to say,
whatever lies I had to tell,

31:36.695 --> 31:39.131
they worked.

31:39.165 --> 31:41.167
He believed me.

31:42.668 --> 31:45.271
*

31:49.475 --> 31:52.144
Chris just got the call--
Sam wants him

31:52.178 --> 31:55.614
to pass the bag off
at East River Park, 4:00 p.m.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.184
Cool.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.585
You okay?

32:01.720 --> 32:05.057
I've had to manipulate
informants before, and...

32:05.091 --> 32:07.626
you want to take a Silkwood
shower when it's done,

32:07.659 --> 32:09.261
but it does get easier.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.631
It gets easier
to manipulate your informants?

32:14.166 --> 32:15.534
What about your consultants?

32:15.567 --> 32:18.337
That's different.
I think you know that.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.106
Oh, yeah, I get it.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.607
It's all in the game.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.311
You never saw that show?

32:28.714 --> 32:30.449
*

32:30.482 --> 32:33.452
Chris wasn't handing
the bag off until 6:00,

32:33.485 --> 32:35.721
so I went straight into
my training session with Casey.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.656
But this time
would be different.

32:39.225 --> 32:41.093
I'm sure Casey wasn't
expecting me

32:41.127 --> 32:42.995
to get the upper hand
that fast, or even at all.

32:43.029 --> 32:45.397
But I knew he would try
after that.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.499
I mean, really try.

32:49.435 --> 32:53.139
He got me a bunch of times,
I got him a few times.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.341
But it was pretty clear
I'd know what to do

32:55.374 --> 32:57.209
if I got in another fight.

32:57.243 --> 32:58.677
CASEY:
Okay, so...

32:58.710 --> 33:00.179
why'd you hustle everybody?

33:00.212 --> 33:03.049
I mean, you've obviously
trained before.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.550
No one learns
that much technique in a day.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.353
I'm a quick study.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.025
BOYLE:
Our people aren't gonna move in

33:13.059 --> 33:15.161
until you walk away
from your brother.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.195
Now, we expect
everything's gonna be

33:16.228 --> 33:19.198
just fine, but we want
you clear of the arrest

33:19.231 --> 33:20.199
for your own safety.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.201
Try not to spend too much time
talking to Sam.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.469
Just give him the bag
and say good-bye.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.310
All right.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.756
Kid's there waiting.

33:49.295 --> 33:51.297
Tunnel is secure.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.036
Good by the south pathway.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.440
We got it surrounded.

34:02.574 --> 34:05.377
You've got two people
coming from the tunnel.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.248
CASEY:
That's Sam Garper.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.216
He's got his buddy with him.

34:10.249 --> 34:11.783
That's Norris Allen.
What's he doing here?

34:11.817 --> 34:13.752
Two-for-one special's on.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.758
Sam.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.228
Hey, bud.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.429
You look awful, man.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.497
SAM:
Looks like you found my bag.

34:28.434 --> 34:29.868
Listen, kid, this is...

34:29.901 --> 34:32.304
this is all gonna get
straightened out, all right?

34:35.674 --> 34:37.876
I'm gonna be back home,
you know.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.878
I don't know when
it's gonna be, but...

34:39.911 --> 34:43.081
we'll see each other again,
all right?

34:44.350 --> 34:46.852
Why are you doing this, man?

34:46.885 --> 34:49.121
Doing what?

34:49.155 --> 34:50.122
What is he doing?

34:51.457 --> 34:52.824
CHRIS:
Hey, I'm sorry.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.226
This is gonna be

34:54.260 --> 34:55.827
a good thing.

34:55.861 --> 34:58.530
He brought the cops.
Let's get the hell out of here.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.368
Sam, don't run!

35:02.401 --> 35:03.602
Don't run!

35:03.635 --> 35:05.837
Don't! Stop!

35:05.871 --> 35:06.838
Move, move, move.

35:06.872 --> 35:07.906
Sam!

35:07.939 --> 35:09.175
Hey!

35:10.876 --> 35:12.844
I'm going out.
No, we're the eyes.
We stay here.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.482
Cover left. Go!

35:20.552 --> 35:22.154
CASEY:
Who has eyes on Norris Allen?

35:22.188 --> 35:23.555
Stay down.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.161
Good?

35:29.195 --> 35:29.795
Yeah.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.930
What happened to Allen?

35:31.963 --> 35:32.898
Don't move!

35:33.765 --> 35:36.134
(gunshots)

35:45.877 --> 35:49.281
We've got Sam Garper in cuffs.
Norris Allen doubled back,

35:49.315 --> 35:50.849
pulled a gun on Chris.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.619
Who fired?
Boyle hit Allen
with three shots.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.720
Thank God.
Finch.

35:54.753 --> 35:58.257
Uh, Allen did get a shot off.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.905
Where's that ambulance?!
Let's go!

36:25.016 --> 36:26.852
I'll call you if
there's anything, too.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.320
Thank you.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.595
We just got a call
from Bellevue.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.430
Chris Garper was
in hydrostatic shock

36:38.464 --> 36:40.732
when they loaded him
into the ambulance.

36:40.766 --> 36:44.336
They opened him up
to operate, but...

36:44.370 --> 36:47.239
there was too much
hemorrhaging.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.741
He didn't make it.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.777
I'm sorry.

36:56.848 --> 36:58.650
(sighs quietly)

36:58.684 --> 37:00.786
So I told him whatever
he needed to hear

37:00.819 --> 37:03.589
to get him to that
meeting, and...

37:03.622 --> 37:05.291
he got killed.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.294
I understand how
you're feeling.

37:09.328 --> 37:11.330
It's awful.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.867
His brother Sam
is gonna be okay.

37:15.901 --> 37:19.771
His radiation burns were
the worst of his injuries.

37:19.805 --> 37:24.710
There's a bomb that won't go off
because of what we did today.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.612
You saved lives.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.381
Yep. But not him.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.050
(exhales)

37:32.083 --> 37:35.654
There had to be way to do both;
I just didn't think it through,

37:35.687 --> 37:37.556
not even on NZT.

37:39.358 --> 37:42.294
This is the worst part
of what we do, Brian.

37:42.328 --> 37:43.762
Working a C.I.

37:43.795 --> 37:46.765
Gets really complicated
really fast.

37:46.798 --> 37:50.736
We try to avoid it,
but sometimes...

37:50.769 --> 37:54.373
what's best
for the case...

37:54.406 --> 37:56.708
what's best for the world,
turns out to be

37:56.742 --> 37:59.077
a very different thing
than what's best for the person.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.347
Yeah, but that's how
we get through it, right?

38:01.380 --> 38:04.683
I mean, we limit morality...
(sniffles)

38:04.716 --> 38:06.685
draw boundaries,
compartmentalize--

38:06.718 --> 38:08.019
like you and Casey.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.888
What?

38:09.921 --> 38:13.659
You say it gets easier
to manipulate people,

38:13.692 --> 38:15.427
to lie.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.396
How can you have
an honest relationship?

38:17.429 --> 38:19.498
Uh, sorry...

38:19.531 --> 38:21.733
how do you know
about me and Casey?

38:21.767 --> 38:23.735
His cologne,
it lingers on you.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.472
Your reaction when Naz
suggested he train me.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.574
The way he shows up
at your desk every morning.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.576
Okay, thank you,
I get it.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.746
(sighs)

38:34.780 --> 38:37.716
Okay, so when I said
it gets easier to lie,

38:37.749 --> 38:39.751
that was a lie.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.756
But you find a way
to live with it.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.628
Can I give you a lift?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.930
No, I could
use the walk.

39:00.806 --> 39:03.842
Hey. You heading home?

39:03.875 --> 39:06.645
Yeah. You?

39:06.678 --> 39:08.614
Oh, maybe.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.081
You doing okay?
Rough day out there.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.550
Yeah.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.453
Our guy Finch is a wreck.

39:14.486 --> 39:15.921
(breathes deeply)

39:15.954 --> 39:17.923
I'm sorry,
I got to ask.

39:17.956 --> 39:21.026
What are you guys
doing with him?

39:21.059 --> 39:24.630
I mean, you remember when
you and me started training?

39:24.663 --> 39:27.032
It took you at
least two weeks

39:27.065 --> 39:28.567
just get a handle
on the breathing.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.836
You said I was gifted.
Yeah, you were.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.505
Brian-- he's already doing
joint locks and chokes

39:33.539 --> 39:35.807
that I didn't learn till
my fifth year on the mat.

39:35.841 --> 39:39.545
It's like he absorbed a decade's
worth of technique in a night.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.780
So either he's hiding the
fact that he had training,

39:41.813 --> 39:43.649
or there's something
else going on.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.116
He's a fast learner.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.653
Mm. That's what
everyone keeps saying.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.589
Yeah. He learned about us.

39:50.622 --> 39:53.592
Oh. So I guess we should
sign that HR form.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.727
No.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.195
(elevator bell dings)

39:57.228 --> 39:58.730
I trust him.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.035
Good night, Casey.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.704
Night, Rebecca.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.973
BRIAN:
If you're watching this,

40:08.006 --> 40:10.609
that means you're me--
me on the pill.

40:10.642 --> 40:13.612
Guy who's been telling me
what to do.

40:13.645 --> 40:15.013
(sighs)

40:15.046 --> 40:16.848
And I know you remember
all this,

40:16.882 --> 40:19.818
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.887
Just because
you remember everything

40:21.920 --> 40:23.922
doesn't mean
you know everything.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.791
We are not omniscient,

40:25.824 --> 40:28.927
or today would have gone
very differently.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.999
And if putting myself first

40:34.032 --> 40:36.868
means being okay with
what happened to Chris Garper,

40:36.902 --> 40:39.538
then I'm not playing.

40:39.571 --> 40:43.642
You tell me I've got to be
ruthless to survive.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.944
But if that means killing
the part of myself

40:45.977 --> 40:48.547
that makes being alive
worthwhile,

40:48.580 --> 40:51.517
that is not
how I'm getting through this.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.985
That isn't how
we're getting through this.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.021
So deal with it.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.559
You don't have a choice, really,

41:00.592 --> 41:03.194
because by the time
I take my next pill,

41:03.228 --> 41:05.764
the damage is already
going to be done.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.572
You okay?

41:13.605 --> 41:15.574
I made a copy
of this file.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.776
I can't tell you
exactly how I got it,

41:17.809 --> 41:20.045
but I do think
you should know what's inside.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.113
You deserve to know
what's inside.

41:22.147 --> 41:23.715
It's about your father,
Rebecca.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.851
Can I come in?

41:25.884 --> 41:27.886
Yeah.
