07:19.189 --> 07:21.774
Nothing, darling. Just passing.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.317
Nat, do you think

07:23.318 --> 07:25.412

to my place a bit later?

07:30.325 --> 07:33.249
- Today?
- I won't take no for an answer.

07:42.048 --> 07:43.590
Gonna have to buy some flowers.

07:43.591 --> 07:45.384
You take your landlady flowers?

07:45.385 --> 07:47.096

- Look, where's my stuff?

10:26.501 --> 10:27.844
I haven't got It.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.295
Stay where you are.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.971
Don't be stupid,
I know where 'you live.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.055

That's good thinking.

10:47.399 --> 10:50.116
I knew you were a smart boy.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.317
You didn't get caught.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.236
You kept your mouth shut.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.910
I just had to test you,
that's all.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.162
Look at this place, eh?

11:02.954 --> 11:05.372
Nothing changes.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.216
You need to get out

11:07.217 --> 11:10.627

11:10.628 --> 11:12.379

Wall, that's why
I had to test you.

11:14.596 --> 11:17.390
- So, I passed?
- Get yourself a cover lob.

11:17.391 --> 11:20.596
- What?
- My employees earn good money.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.389
People who earn
good money spend It.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.141
People with no jobs
spending money draws attention.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.226
I don't llke attention.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.946
Get yourself a cover job,

11:32.483 --> 11:35.360
Smlym.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.322
And bring my stuff back.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.327
If I could get a cover job,
I wouldn't need this one.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.895

12:09.896 --> 12:12.149

- Got what?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.955

- Okay, okay.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.507

12:37.924 --> 12:39.517

Yep.

Hello, Ayyash.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.148
Come In. Come In.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.402
Thank you.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.297
There was a lot
of drugs floating around.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.493
In that club last night.

13:42.494 --> 13:46.033
I told you, my son wasn't
Involved. He's a good boy.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.786
You often go out the window,
do you?

13:47.787 --> 13:50.751
There was a lot of noise.
I just followed my friends.

13:50.752 --> 13:53.045
Your friends get something to hide?
-No.

13:53.046 --> 13:55.760
- You got something to hlde?
- No.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.261
Humanitarian protection and
discretionary leave to remain.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.892
Listen, I don't want to sea
your face again, all right?

14:06.893 --> 14:08.982
Otherwise It wlll mean trouble.
You got It?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.145
Thank you.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.741
Are you In trouble?

14:27.742 --> 14:29.910
It's nothing.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.454
What were you doing
In a nightclub?

14:32.455 --> 14:33.502
It's where my friends were.

14:33.503 --> 14:35.957
You don't want me
to have friends?

14:35.958 --> 14:38.254
I don't like being your
mother and your father...

14:38.255 --> 14:41.597
- I don't want you to...
- But that's what Allah wanted...

14:41.598 --> 14:43.637
wand he has his reasons-.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.809
I called-The police answered.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.567
There's a job where I work.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.230
We don't see you at the.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.446
Friendship Club tea
dances anymore.

15:00.447 --> 15:02.487
And you were always
such a good dancer.

15:02.488 --> 15:05.034
Wall, there's no one to
dance with, really, ls there?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.413
Time ls a great healer, Hat.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.619
But your Maurice
only died six weeks ago.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.043
And only now am I
beginning to move on.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.922
Mrs. Sllverlnan. Joanna.
Is this about the shop?

15:22.713 --> 15:26.716
You're as bad as Maurice.
There's more to llfo, Nat.

15:26.717 --> 15:30.637
Joanna, please?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.515
Oh, If you insist.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.393
- I'm selling up.
- What?

15:36.394 --> 15:39.354
The freehold on the shop.

15:39.355 --> 15:43.066
Wall, Maurice Is gone,
and it was his thing, really-.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.195
Yeah, but If someone
buys the bulldlng,

15:45.196 --> 15:46.614
they could force me out.

15:46.615 --> 15:48.326
Oh, I'm sure he
wouldn't do that.

15:48.327 --> 15:49.823
The community needs you.

15:49.824 --> 15:53.454
- He? He who?
- The man who wants to buy It.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.713
He thinks he can charm
an old woman...

15:56.714 --> 16:00.711
but I Ilka my men
a little bit more mature.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.881
The deal for the chemist

16:15.766 --> 16:18.643
The Jaw wlll know

Once you own the whole parade,

16:20.316 --> 16:22.782
we can demolish it and
you can build your car park.

16:22.783 --> 16:24.357
Yeah.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.235

26:57.121 --> 26:59.659
I mean, how much
longer can It go on?

26:59.660 --> 27:03.371
The shop has been In the family

27:03.372 --> 27:05.123
And If anyone cared,

You've got food dye

So where ls the son?

28:27.623 --> 28:31.584
"I had hoped one day
that my son would be “the son."

28:31.585 --> 28:33.132
But apparently the
world can't have

28:33.133 --> 28:34.971
too many Jewish lawyers.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.143
Just mind your own business,
will you?

28:40.144 --> 28:41.432
Get back to It.

28:47.517 --> 28:51.145

28:51.146 --> 28:54.899

29:18.882 --> 29:21.509

29:23.601 --> 29:25.188
Well, look at all this stuff.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.150
Yeah, well, they're good at

29:31.478 --> 29:34.527
'Wanna ditch the film
and look for some porn?

29:34.528 --> 29:36.525
- No.

29:38.652 --> 29:42.029
Do you even know
how to turn It on?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.031
Yeah.

29:49.746 --> 29:52.044
We get everything frozen

Bake them up a treat.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.629

A bakery, as It happens.

29:56.630 --> 29:59.844
Before them lot from next door

29:59.845 --> 30:02.091
After that, Dad branched out.
Best thing he ever did.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.765
We've got shops all
over the country now.

30:03.766 --> 30:05.474
But you never forget your roots.

30:05.475 --> 30:07.310
Now, you know the people,

30:07.311 --> 30:10.184
I want you to head up

What do I do at the end?

35:02.859 --> 35:05.519
That's It,
just scrunch It together.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.760
- All right?

35:08.440 --> 35:11.233
Your first challah. Say It.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.453
- "Challah."
- My first challah.

35:15.739 --> 35:19.368
Man, I'm stuck In that bakery so

35:19.369 --> 35:20.868
How about you just
stick to baking?

35:20.869 --> 35:24.038
Yeah, but baking doesn't
get me out of here.

35:24.039 --> 35:29.045
Why don't you just do both?
Llke from the bakery?

35:29.336 --> 35:32.008
No, that's the dumbest

35:32.009 --> 35:34.599

35:54.569 --> 35:59.406

Oh, connoisseur? Cool.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.250
Do you often leave

38:52.251 --> 38:55.165
What? No, no, of course not.

38:55.166 --> 38:59.127

I told hlm this was ready to go.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.062
Yeah, well, It's

39:13.063 --> 39:14.652
at the moment, you know.

What with Danny gone.

What's that? Looks llke

39:54.735 --> 39:57.853
Oh, It's an old technique
from back home.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.652
Makes bread llght as a feather.

39:59.653 --> 40:01.866
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.025
Where you wine?

40:03.026 --> 40:04.994
I'm going to throw It away-
It's no good.

40:04.995 --> 40:09.197
No, no, no. Come back.
No, It looks fine.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.745
Come on, come on.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.040
Just knead It a bit more,
that's all.

40:15.041 --> 40:16.164
All right? There you go.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.026
I can'! Believe It.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.487
- They haven't told you?
- No.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.780
I heard It from my wife,

40:49.781 --> 40:51.926
who heard It from $ldney's wife
who heard It from Sidney,

40:51.950 --> 40:53.247
who was at the board meeting.

40:54.786 --> 40:59.081
- Dld they say why?
- Falling membership.

40:59.082 --> 41:02.000
Can't afford a
klddush every week.

41:02.001 --> 41:05.926
Not even cake and biscuits?

41:05.964 --> 41:08.183
It's my biggest account,
for God's sake.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.521
Shabbat Shalom <i>,</i> Nat.

41:22.522 --> 41:26.608
I hope you're checking your
Icing sugar for anthrax now.

41:26.609 --> 41:30.112
- Nat, you heard the news?
- Not from you, Rabbl.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.536
Listen, maybe we can do
a breakfast once a month.

41:32.537 --> 41:35.117
- Some challah, some cakes.
- Yeah.

41:35.118 --> 41:39.246
I'm sorry, Nat.
It's tough. It's tough times-.

41:39.247 --> 41:42.290
Dld you replace Danny
with a Muslim kid?

41:42.291 --> 41:45.961
Tough times- Jnterestl ng.

41:45.962 --> 41:47.339
And he's black, I heard.

41:52.719 --> 41:55.303
Great challah, Dad.

41:55.304 --> 41:58.808
- Delicious. Who wants some more?
- Me!

42:10.028 --> 42:12.029
Three men, three men had gene
to see the doctor.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.283
One sitting there
outside the room, he says.

42:14.284 --> 42:16.908
"Oh, lwlsh I could pee.“"

42:16.909 --> 42:18.285
The other old man says.

42:18.286 --> 42:21.204
"Oh, lwlsh I could
have a bowel movement."

42:21.205 --> 42:26.001
The other man says
"Oh, every momlng I pee at <i>9</i>"

42:26.002 --> 42:28.050
I have a bowel movement at 10.

42:28.051 --> 42:30.464
"I only wlsh I got up before 11."

42:32.967 --> 42:34.514
I got one, I got one.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.311
This man really
wants to be an actor.

42:39.312 --> 42:43.351
He gets a small part In a play,
but only has one llne:

42:43.352 --> 42:46.026
"Captain, I can hear the cannons
In the distance.“"

42:46.064 --> 42:49.858
He practices all the time.
Finally, It's opening night.

42:49.859 --> 42:53.904
He comes on to do hls llne,
and suddenly 50 cannons go off.

42:53.905 --> 42:57.991
And the man says, "Jesus Christ,
what the hell was that?“"

43:05.083 --> 43:06.756
Oh, Rebecca.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.093
Is this new wine? Good?

43:16.844 --> 43:18.471
Let's use this from now on.

43:22.934 --> 43:25.528
I don't understand It,
I felt fine yesterday.

43:25.529 --> 43:27.729
Today the arthritis ls back.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.356
Took me seven minutes
to get to the plsher.

43:29.357 --> 43:32.156
L-lere you are, Rabbl.
Smashing challah last week.

43:35.780 --> 43:39.449

43:39.450 --> 43:42.165
- Yeah, he did last week's batch.
- Yeah?

43:42.166 --> 43:44.880
Perhaps he has a gift.
Maybe black magic.

43:44.881 --> 43:46.670
Keep your voice down-.

44:06.853 --> 44:10.355
- You must be Olivia.
- What's your name?

44:10.356 --> 44:13.405
- Your grandpa didn't tell you?
- "He just calls you “the boy."

44:16.154 --> 44:21.786
- Is that a magic carpet?
- Yes, In a way. It's holy.

44:23.161 --> 44:26.791
- Hasn't got any holes In It.
- No, this ls true.

44:28.708 --> 44:32.008
- Does It fly?
- No, sorry.

44:34.297 --> 44:38.508
- What does It do, then?
- It helps me talk to Allah.

44:38.509 --> 44:41.511
- Who's Allah?
- Allah, God.

44:41.512 --> 44:45.765
God's name Is Allah?
He has many names.

44:45.766 --> 44:49.145
Do you talk to God
because you're lonely?

44:49.187 --> 44:53.909
For many reasons.
And are you? Are you lonely?

44:56.986 --> 45:00.780
Daddy never plays with me.
He's always busy working.

45:00.781 --> 45:03.950
You know, you have a
nice family, Olivia.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.079
They care about you,
they just...

45:06.080 --> 45:07.830
They don'! Always
know how to show It.

45:18.299 --> 45:21.803
Wages. And there's plenty more
where that came from.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.477
You send Phlllp In
on your way out, please.

45:25.478 --> 45:26.941
<i>Okay-</i>

45:29.810 --> 45:31.853
He wants you.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.276
And close the door.

45:36.567 --> 45:39.616
Do you thlnk I don't know
you've been thieving, son?

46:41.048 --> 46:43.717
Where the bloody hell
have you been?

46:43.718 --> 46:45.311
I've got customers waiting.

46:51.350 --> 46:53.643
1'?

46:53.644 --> 46:55.317
They don't care about us,
you know.

46:56.605 --> 46:59.316
Poor Africans.
We mean nothing to them.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.775
- Ayyash.
- If Father was here...

47:00.776 --> 47:02.277
he would not allow
this to happen.

47:02.278 --> 47:06.406
- He wlll be here, soon.
- He should be here new.

47:06.407 --> 47:08.658
Is there anyone who can help?

47:08.659 --> 47:11.206
We den! Knew many people
In this country.

47:11.207 --> 47:15.045
I think there ls someone
from our village In Birmingham-.

47:15.046 --> 47:16.543
Maybe we can slay there.

47:16.544 --> 47:18.168
Birmingham'? That's miles away.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.670
Anyway, you can't leave,
I need you.

47:20.671 --> 47:24.257
A cleaner and an assistant?

47:24.258 --> 47:25.475
<i>Pass the toast.</i>

47:28.971 --> 47:30.348
Thank you.

47:32.058 --> 47:34.356
You could...
You could stay here.

47:36.562 --> 47:38.897
No, thank you, Mr. Dayan,

47:38.898 --> 47:40.491

too much already.

47:40.492 --> 47:42.817
- Trouble?
- We cannot.

47:42.818 --> 47:44.491
It wouldn't be rlght.

47:49.033 --> 47:50.080
Why not?

47:52.161 --> 47:55.080
What are we watching tonight,

47:55.081 --> 47:59.417
- Agaln?
- Agaln? You're one to talk.

47:59.418 --> 48:01.045
Do you know how to
use the computer yet?

48:03.464 --> 48:05.091
Butch and Sundance, then.

48:20.981 --> 48:22.449
You were saying?

48:23.484 --> 48:25.527
Yeah, well, what could I do?

48:25.528 --> 48:27.121
I mean, I couldn't
let hlm leave.

48:27.122 --> 48:28.279
People wlll talk.

48:28.280 --> 48:31.408
Yeah, but my takings
have doubled.

48:31.409 --> 48:34.828
I mean, you sald It yourself.
What If he's gifted?

48:34.829 --> 48:37.789
I mean, he does this thing,

48:37.790 --> 48:42.127
You know. Whatever.

48:42.128 --> 48:44.881
Anyway, as long as he keeps
doing what he's doing...

48:44.882 --> 48:46.757
they can stay
as long as they want.

48:50.177 --> 48:52.145
Oh, God.

48:53.514 --> 48:55.265
The plumber': Coming
In the morning.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.142
I thlnk It's for the best.

48:57.143 --> 48:59.692
Are you sure that's not
how you flooded your place?

49:01.480 --> 49:03.356
Not that It matters anyway.

49:03.357 --> 49:06.031
Unless we have a week
as good as last week's,

49:06.032 --> 49:07.694
we'll all be homeless.

49:07.695 --> 49:09.863
Unless you know any rich Sheiks.

49:09.864 --> 49:14.200
- I told you, African, not Arab.

49:28.507 --> 49:30.976
So how much do you

49:32.761 --> 49:34.183
All of It.

49:41.937 --> 49:44.486
- What Is this?
- Hash.

49:47.109 --> 49:48.406
How much ls It?

49:55.576 --> 49:59.162
Brownies? We don! Make brownies.

49:59.163 --> 50:01.539
<i>$0?</i>

50:01.540 --> 50:03.793
We've been making the same
things for over 30 years.

50:03.794 --> 50:05.510
Look, just try one.

50:10.508 --> 50:13.227
How do you know how to make
chocolate brownies, anyway?

50:13.228 --> 50:18.181
It's an old family recipe,
from back home. Very good.

50:18.182 --> 50:20.435
You have chocolate brownies
where you come from?

50:20.436 --> 50:22.107
Of course.

50:30.569 --> 50:33.869
- It's all rlght, yeah.
- You'll see.

50:38.118 --> 50:40.328

<i>That's ma.</i>

50:45.751 --> 50:47.924
- You having one?
- No.

50:51.799 --> 50:53.925
I could get to llke these.

50:53.926 --> 50:56.850
So I sald, “Gene Kelly?

50:59.807 --> 51:01.434
Jumping In puddles?

51:03.519 --> 51:07.230
I can do that."
"Yeah, prove It," she sald.

51:07.231 --> 51:10.900
Yeah. Next night
we went dancing.

51:10.901 --> 51:13.529
After that, we were never apart-.

51:16.115 --> 51:20.461
Do you know, I can't believe
we've never made these.

51:23.998 --> 51:29.004
- Hey, do you want this one?
- No, they were for you.

51:37.928 --> 51:42.599
They're very special.
New recipe, lots of poppy seeds.

51:42.600 --> 51:46.936

51:46.937 --> 51:47.937
Thank you.

53:23.951 --> 53:28.957
<i>, acme to bed.</i>

53:29.707 --> 53:32.335
I'm In the mood
for an early night.

53:43.178 --> 53:45.596
You see them queues out there?

53:45.597 --> 53:48.316
None of this strikes
you as a little strange?

53:48.317 --> 53:50.184
Nat ls a great baker.

53:50.185 --> 53:51.687
Ha just needed to move
with the times.

53:51.729 --> 53:54.981
Oh, Is that It?
Is that all you gotta say'?

53:54.982 --> 53:58.154
Some Ilttle black boy helps Nat
shuffle Into the 21st century...

53:58.155 --> 54:00.653
and suddenly
the shop's a goldmine?

54:00.654 --> 54:03.123
No, no, no, there's something
wrong here. I'm done with this.

54:15.377 --> 54:18.174
It's llke Fiddler on the Roof
meets West Slde Story out them.

54:18.175 --> 54:19.719
Look out for your rings,
everybody-.

54:19.720 --> 54:22.719
I'm Impressed. I mean It.

54:22.760 --> 54:23.977
I thought you was
on your way out,

54:23.978 --> 54:25.720
and now look,
stronger than ever.

54:25.721 --> 54:28.349
What do you want? -To buy
you out, falr and square.

54:28.350 --> 54:30.767
- Not for sale.
- Hear me out.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.188
I'll be your landlord soon,

54:32.189 --> 54:34.735
and my lawyers wlll be all
over your precious lease.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.361
We could do this
dance for months,

54:36.362 --> 54:39.197
but I'll get what I want
In the end, so why bother?

54:39.198 --> 54:41.446
You tell me the secret
of your success,

54:41.447 --> 54:43.321
put yourself under
the Cohen's banner...

54:43.322 --> 54:45.364
I'll create one blg shop

54:45.365 --> 54:48.201
with a dedicated
Dayan bakery brand.

54:48.202 --> 54:50.912
Picture It,
"The Kosher Klpllng."

54:50.913 --> 54:52.709
And you get the best
of both worlds.

54:52.710 --> 54:55.208
A share of the profits,
none of the hassle.

54:55.209 --> 54:57.462
- And your legacy secured.
- Not Interested.

54:57.463 --> 54:59.796
You could retire In luxury.

54:59.797 --> 55:02.892
What, you thlnk I wanna buy my
retirement by selling my soul?

55:04.802 --> 55:06.511
Nat, you've done It.

55:06.512 --> 55:09.388
You've achieved the
Immigrant dream.

55:09.389 --> 55:12.605
You've got your own Business-
Your son's a big-time lawyer.

55:12.606 --> 55:15.354
How long can you and some
Ethiopian kid keep It up?

55:18.232 --> 55:22.485
My grandfather
was born In Stepney,

55:22.486 --> 55:24.487
my father was born
In Walthamstow...

55:24.488 --> 55:28.038
and I was born In llfond,
you stupid, Ignorant barrow boy.

55:28.039 --> 55:30.743
You don't wanna do this,
old man.

55:30.744 --> 55:32.834
Do you know how long the
Jews have been around?

55:32.835 --> 55:34.626
And how many times
people have come for us?

55:34.627 --> 55:37.627
No one cares about this place.
It dies with you.

55:37.628 --> 55:41.051
Hey, mister, I'm not from
Ethiopia, I'm from Darfur,

55:41.052 --> 55:42.468
and I care.

55:49.471 --> 55:53.808
- I don! Llke bullies.
- Yeah.

55:53.809 --> 55:56.938
- Ho'll be knocking on your door.
- Yeah, especially If we wln.

56:01.316 --> 56:02.692
I'm not dolng It.

56:02.693 --> 56:05.319
It's Important.
Our future depends on It.

56:05.320 --> 56:06.840
I thought you sald
you were good at this.

56:06.864 --> 56:08.457
Well, It's been a while-.

56:08.458 --> 56:11.659
It's Inappropriate
employer-employee relations.

56:11.660 --> 56:13.244
What do you know about It?

56:13.245 --> 56:14.462
You've been In the
job five minutes,

56:14.463 --> 56:16.081
and you're living
with me already.

56:22.421 --> 56:25.015
Come on, don't be a baby.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.354
All right? Rlght.

56:34.057 --> 56:38.644
Just... Look, put your... Put
that foot... Put your foot back.

56:38.645 --> 56:40.985
You need to practice this?
We're barely even moving.

56:40.986 --> 56:42.073
All rlght, all rlght.

56:43.984 --> 56:45.504
That's It, that's It.
Come on, come on.

56:54.369 --> 56:56.746
I thlnk I broke something.

56:56.747 --> 56:58.966
- What, you or the equipment?
- Mel.

56:58.967 --> 57:02.086
- Oh, that's all right, than.
- Fuck.

57:04.504 --> 57:07.506
See? That's why we
need to practice.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.350
I don't want to kill her, do I?
Right?

57:21.939 --> 57:25.608
- You've still got It, Nat.
- So Is that a "yes"?

57:25.609 --> 57:27.401
I know men llke you.

57:27.402 --> 57:30.576
You keep trying to butter me up
and sweep me off <i>my</i> feet...

57:30.577 --> 57:33.658
- _lust to get what you want.
- You got me.

57:33.659 --> 57:34.784
I'd llke to help, Nat,

57:34.785 --> 57:37.208
but Cotton ls threatening
to pull out.

57:37.209 --> 57:41.791
Cottorfs bluffing.
Everything's gonna be fine.

57:41.792 --> 57:44.669
I just need a ilttle more tlme,
trust ma.

57:44.670 --> 57:46.045
All right.

57:58.850 --> 58:00.726
You did what?

58:00.727 --> 58:04.105
Hold her she should sell
to me and not to Cotton.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.898
I can raise the money.

58:05.899 --> 58:08.948
Besides, I lhlnk Mrs. Sllverlnan
ls sweet on me.

58:08.986 --> 58:10.653
Th Is Is crazy.

58:10.654 --> 58:13.373
I mean, the turnaround at
the shop has been marvelous.

58:13.374 --> 58:15.366
But It won't last.

58:15.367 --> 58:19.120
Thlnk about It. Take a break.

58:19.121 --> 58:20.623
Olivia would love
you to take her

58:20.624 --> 58:22.215
on holiday during half-term.

58:22.216 --> 58:25.543
Maybe the seaside.
She'll understand.

58:25.544 --> 58:27.797
This ls your retirement
you're gambling with.

58:27.798 --> 58:29.714
Your Inheritance, you mean.

58:29.715 --> 58:32.093
Dad, you didn't send
me to Cambridge

58:32.094 --> 58:33.968
so I could become a baker.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.262
I'm partner In one of the
country's biggest law firms.

58:36.263 --> 58:37.731
I don't even know what
the shop ls worth.

58:38.890 --> 58:41.480
- This ls family business.
- So is the shop.

58:41.481 --> 58:43.022
Who the hell are you, anyway?

58:43.023 --> 58:44.691
You turn up out of the blue

58:44.692 --> 58:46.609
and all of a sudden you're
living with my dad?

58:46.610 --> 58:48.446
- Hls mother ls too.
- Is this your plan?

58:48.447 --> 58:50.443
Worm your way In and get
It all for yourself?

58:50.444 --> 58:52.947
- Work my father Into hls grave?
- Stephen, enough.

58:52.948 --> 58:56.991
Because I can tell you what
definitely Isn't family. You.

58:58.827 --> 59:00.953
You talk about family?

59:00.954 --> 59:02.747
This ls a family business,

59:02.748 --> 59:04.625
and he ls the only
one who cares.

59:06.334 --> 59:09.003
You know, Mom was
really proud of me.

59:09.004 --> 59:10.504
Why can't you be?

59:14.468 --> 59:16.886
Just go, wlll you?

59:16.887 --> 59:18.605

59:43.997 --> 59:45.840
Looks llke you're an old pro,
Nat.

59:47.501 --> 59:49.219
It's been a long time
since I've done this.

59:50.545 --> 59:53.547
You were a great boxer?

59:53.548 --> 59:55.299
Yeah.

59:55.300 --> 59:57.177
Yeah, the next I-(Id Berg.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.014
Never mind-.

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:05.068
You know, the community's
getting smaller.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.228
We cannot rely on Jews.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:10.824
- There's nothing new there.
- And your point ls?

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.944
If we Increase our range,

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.696
we'll attract more
new customers.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.119
Are you getting
this from a book?

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.743
Ho, the Internet-.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.704
Wlll you still be able to bake?

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:29.083
Oh, yeah.
I'll always be able to bake.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.085
My father trusted me with It.

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:32.174
Next tlme I see hlm,

01:00:32.175 --> 01:00:34.548
I don't wanna tell hlm
I let It all go kaput.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.016
He must have loved you very much

01:00:37.017 --> 01:00:38.931
to leave you something
so special.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:47.107
- Dld your father give you that?
- Yeah, In a way.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:50.614
Ha hld It on ma In case we
needed t0 bribe someone.

01:00:50.615 --> 01:00:53.858
- What happened?
- The Janjaweed.

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:56.944
- Always the Janjaweed.
- Who?

01:00:56.945 --> 01:00:59.405
Men on horses with guns.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:02.330
They rode into our village
and did terrible things.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:08.875
Yeah, attacking Muslims.
Madness.

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:12.251
Where's your father now, Ayyash?

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:15.379
My mother and I made It
to the Red Cross.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.049
Yeah, we waited,
but It was too dangerous.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.760
We had to make It
across the border.

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:25.766
We waited agaln for many months,
but he never came.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:29.351
Is he dead?

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.525
My mother likes to
pretend he's not.

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:35.858
You know, no one <i>cared</i> about us,
Nat.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:38.157
My father was a hero
In our village.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:42.371
You know, he saved lives,
but we lost everything.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:46.285
You know, we were a real family.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:48.664
Ifs better he ran
and came with us.

01:01:48.665 --> 01:01:53.125
Yeah, but If he'd run, would
you still be wearing his ring'?

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:55.419
Well, If he does come for It,

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.424
I don't want It
covered In dough.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:06.435
Give It here.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.356
There you go.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.908
I don't want you losing It.

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:27.244
Thank you.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.523
- Hey, It looks good.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:58.649
- Lord, I look old.
- You didn't know?

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.243
You have mirrors.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:02.236
Cheeky bugger.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.668
- Thank you.
- You're walcome.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:21.588
Yeah, we don't shave,
after your wife dies.

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:23.465
It's a sign of mourning-.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:27.136
- How long for?
- Thirty days, normally.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.389
How long since she died?

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:32.985
Well, It'll be two years
on the 28th.

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:38.856
I mean, why would he take her
and not me?

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:41.360
She only ever done good
In the World.

01:03:41.361 --> 01:03:43.908
If you were God, who would you
rather spend time with?

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.200
What do you lhlnk?

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:59.043
- Hello?
- Where have you been?

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:02.796
- Busy, working for you.
- Why did you miss the drop?

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.095
And why ls your place
all cleared out?

01:04:05.096 --> 01:04:06.550
It got flooded.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:07.676
- Listen.
- I'm nearly sold out.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.520
You'll have your money soon,
I swear.

01:04:09.521 --> 01:04:12.431
Ayyash you don't want
me to come to you.

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:14.275
You don't want that, trust me.

01:04:14.276 --> 01:04:17.936
- Look, I've got to go.
- Don't you...

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:19.530
hang up.

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:26.153
It's nearly prayer time.

01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:29.448
Don't you thlnk God, Allah,
whatever...

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:32.496
gets a bit fed up of listening
to you five times a day?

01:04:32.497 --> 01:04:34.167
He hasn't told me to shut up.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:40.834
Think my Esther would approve.
She always dressed nice.

01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:43.175
Yeah, I thlnk It's time
to start living agaln.

01:04:43.176 --> 01:04:46.093
Maybe you can start by taking
that holiday. Make Olivia happy.

01:04:46.094 --> 01:04:48.344
Yeah, who'd look after the shop?
You?

01:04:48.345 --> 01:04:51.595
- Why not?
- The blg man.

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:53.222
You've been a baker
for five minutes.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.390
Feels longer.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:55.557
Joanna.

01:04:55.558 --> 01:05:00.020
Oh, my, look at you.
Very distinguished.

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:04.858
- This Is Mrs. Sllverman?
- And you must be "the boy."

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.860
Ayyash. Pleased to meet you.

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.826
I heard you worked wonders
with the shop.

01:05:08.827 --> 01:05:10.199
I still have a lot to learn,

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.866
but Mr. Dayan Is a
very good teacher.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:16.787
Is he, now? I certainly hope so.

01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:20.042
Well, maybe you'll find out
at the next tea dance.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.378
I look forward to It.

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:33.559
- What was that?
- I've no Idea.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.059
- Tomorrow, okay?
- What?

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:42.280
Look after the shop.
You know, just for the day.

01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:43.444
See how It goes.

01:06:01.088 --> 01:06:02.254
<i>H37'.</i>

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.712
<i>Mr. Dawn's not here.</i>

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.799
Look, I don't want any trouble.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:12.594
Give me two bagels,
five muffins.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:47.550
Keep the change.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:03.186

Everything all right?
It's about the shop.

What? Is there a problem?
Is Ayyash all right?

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:23.172
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.801
- All fight?

01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:40.639
What are you doing?
What Is It? Oh, shit.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.859

They came to my house.
I didn't wanna believe them.

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:17.175
I didn't want to.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:19.178
I should never have trusted
one of you people.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.062
Get out.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:41.009
Cannabis? That's ridiculous.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.600

think of It first, really.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.519

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.057

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.385
Where's <i>my</i> money?

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:50.392
You know, I always read
the local newspaper...

01:11:50.393 --> 01:11:54.235
"because I Ilka to know what's
going on In my neighborhood."

01:11:54.236 --> 01:11:56.770
Usually fuck all.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:12:00.275
Then all ofi a sudden
I look at this.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.860
Struggling local business
does good, eh?

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:08.365
A ilttle old Yid and a stinking
Muzzle working In harmony.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.659
It's touching, that ls.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.788
Now tell me you're

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:23.880
Well, If that's
where my money went,

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.633
that's where I'm gonna get It.

01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:44.948
Step away from It.

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:47.867

You really wanna do this?

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:21.981
You wanna go up against me
to protect some old Jew?

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:25.609
Look at this place.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:27.612
Someone should put
It out of Its misery.

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:47.047
Stop, don't! Stop, stop!

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:48.391
Stop It, stop!

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.982
Thank you, Frodo.

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:14.075
Come on, then. Come on.

- Okay.

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.728
Please, don't say anything.

01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:44.029
Bloody hell, Nat, I didn't think
It was Hanukkah time already.

01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:45.939
Let me through, please.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.659
Excuse me. This ls my place.

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:52.070
Oh, my God.

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:54.030
Joanna, you'll catch
your death of cold.

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:55.782
I had a phone call to come
down here Immediately.

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:57.742
What the hell happened?

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:00.120
- Was It a terrorist attack?
- Don't worry.

01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:03.293
Don't worry? Don't worry?
You blew up my nest egg.

01:15:03.294 --> 01:15:05.755
I trusted you. You said
everything would be fine.

01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:08.128
Mrs. Sllverman, I have
to ask you to calm down.

01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:09.381
You can ask all you llke, sonny,

01:15:09.382 --> 01:15:11.551
but don't you bet on
anything happening...

01:15:11.552 --> 01:15:13.597
not untll I get
some bloody answers.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:18.435
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

01:15:18.436 --> 01:15:19.723
You bloody Idiot.

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.476
- Nat.
- You bloody idiot.

01:15:21.477 --> 01:15:23.819
- After all I've done for you.
- You did It for yourself.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.603
- What?
- I heard you.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.731
You thought It was me,
my baking.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:29.571
We could stay
as long as we want.

01:15:29.572 --> 01:15:32.195
You pretend we're family, but
you only care about your shop.

01:15:32.196 --> 01:15:33.491
I don't want you In my house.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:36.373
I don't want you near my family.
You're nothing to me.

01:15:36.374 --> 01:15:38.992
Never trust a Jew.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:41.462
We had nothing.
What also was I to do?

01:15:41.463 --> 01:15:44.039
Oh, Ayyash.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.543
Come back. Come here.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.718
What am I gonna
tell your mother?

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.809
How about A for arson,
B for burglary,

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:02.724
C for cannabis,
and D for dealing?

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:05.194
Yeah, because I'm nicking you
for the lot. Now move.

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:46.142
- For the pain-
- Allah forbids.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:48.237
What about puffing
on your magic dragon?

01:16:48.238 --> 01:16:51.523
I don't. It's just a job.

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:52.901
Yeah.

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:58.488
You can stay here
for your mother's sake,

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.162
but we're finished.

01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:04.327
- I'm selling up.
- You're what?

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:05.328
You can't just...

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:17.841
Oh, yeah.

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:20.301
Oh, thanks, officer.

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.679
Yeah, no, I understand.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:25.348
That's ridiculous.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:28.102
Who'd believe such a thing?

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.738
Yeah. Yeah, all right,
I'll tell hlm.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:34.789
- Rlght, thanks for calling.
- No problem.

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:41.158
They managed to get hlm
before he cleared out.

01:17:41.159 --> 01:17:42.991
He'll be going down.

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:44.835
They sald they won't
press charges against you...

01:17:44.836 --> 01:17:47.871
"because of your
ongoing cooperation."

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:49.840
- Then It's over.
- Well...

01:17:51.542 --> 01:17:54.466
Victor's telling stories
about the bakery and cannabis.

01:17:54.467 --> 01:17:56.462
Police don't believe hlm.

01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:59.433
In any case, he torched
the evidence, didn't he?

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.221
I saw Cotton tonight.

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:09.517
We do the deal tomorrow,
then we'll go our separate ways.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.986
Look, Nat, please,
don't do this.

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:12.446
No, It's a done deal.

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:15.824
LOOK...

01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:18.943
Cotton came In today.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.865
I dropped some of the
stuff on the floor.

01:18:20.866 --> 01:18:22.661
I think he saw It. Ha knows-.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:25.955
What are you talking about?

01:18:25.956 --> 01:18:29.204
He bought goods. He suspects.

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:31.623
He bought g...

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:36.044
Oh, God, that's why
he was acting so strange.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.629
He knows, doesn't he?

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.179
He's gonna screw me
for everything I've got.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:43.176
Of course, he'll need proof.

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:44.895
Yeah, he'll have them tested,
wen'! He?

01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:48.357
I'll have to get them back.

01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:54.771
Nat, what are you doing?
You know this ls crazy.

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:57.446
- Nobody's asking you to come.
- It's stealing, Nat.

01:18:57.447 --> 01:18:58.942
It's exchanging.

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:00.989
I'll be In and out
before he's any the wiser.

01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:02.825
You know you can't do this,
right?

01:19:02.826 --> 01:19:05.448
Listen, If he finds cannabis
In my stuff,

01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:07.992
It'll back up
everything Victor sald.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.535
Never mind a deal-.

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:11.379
The police wlll have no option
but to Investigate.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.164
So, I've got two choices.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:16.584
Either I retire in luxury,
or I retire in jail.

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.883
- I'm coming with you.
- I don't need your help.

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:21.223
It's my neck on the llne too.

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:23.258
Do you even know what he bought?

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:26.427

Are you sure about this?

01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:45.989

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:19.564
Rabbit flu? Never heard of It.

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:21.784
Yes, It's worse than pig-
Very contagious.

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:26.864
You'd better get started, then.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:33.202

01:24:26.987 --> 01:24:28.854
Yeah.

01:24:28.855 --> 01:24:31.482
Joanna, didn't
know you'd be here.

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.234
Hello, Nat.

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:35.033
Mr. Cotton told me you
were selling up today.

01:24:35.034 --> 01:24:36.529
I thought I'd do the same.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:39.374
- No point In messing about.
- Yeah. Sit down, Stephen.

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:44.581
Are you gonna do that, or we
gonna get on with the deal?

01:24:44.582 --> 01:24:46.674
- What's the rush?
- Bad smell In here.

01:24:46.675 --> 01:24:49.009
Well, maybe It's
that you know...

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.378
that I know.

01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:53.380
Know what?

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:57.476
- You know.
- What are you talking about?

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.730
Nat': Been loading his goods
with marijuana.

01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:07.143
I saw It with my own eyes.

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:08.896
It was nothing. It was only a...

01:25:08.897 --> 01:25:10.192
Prove It.

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:14.322
- Dld you know about this?
- No.

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.487
Best Bridge Club ever.

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:20.740
Bought some off Abdul
here yesterday.

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:23.663
Got the munchies a bit later,
I can tell you.

01:25:23.664 --> 01:25:25.913
But I saved some
for the lab boys...

01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:28.757
and I've got the
results rlght here.

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:34.429
Now, we don't have to
go to the police

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:40.394
but what you have to do ls walk
away from the shop with nothing.

01:25:47.017 --> 01:25:49.393
You haven't got anything.

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.192
If you had, I wouldn't
be sat here, would I?

01:25:51.193 --> 01:25:52.656
They'd have me down the station.

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:57.818
I know what you did,
I bloody know It.

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.219
You can't prove It,
though, can you?

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:10.956
Bloody hell. All rlght.

01:26:10.957 --> 01:26:12.925
Sign the contract.
Let's get this over with.

01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:22.218
- Ol, leave that alone.
- Wha's."s that? What...?

01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:24.637
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

01:26:24.638 --> 01:26:26.477
A lot of fuss about nothing.

01:26:26.478 --> 01:26:28.601
It's just something
we've been working on.

01:26:28.602 --> 01:26:29.767
U

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:31.395
It's nothing, nothing. Sit down.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:41.659
You're nut expanding, are you?

01:26:41.697 --> 01:26:43.290
You're bulldlng
this monstrosity.

01:26:43.291 --> 01:26:45.700
This ls my worst store
In London.

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:47.791
The shopping centers are
breathing down my neck.

01:26:47.792 --> 01:26:49.288
They want another car park.

01:26:49.289 --> 01:26:52.166
I can make more money from cars
than from customers.

01:26:52.167 --> 01:26:54.417
Sign the contract,
and so could you.

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:56.546
The area's gone to the dogs,
anyway.

01:26:56.547 --> 01:26:58.468
Just ask Mr. Halal over there.

01:26:58.469 --> 01:27:00.965
- What?
- All rlght, easy, son.

01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:03.970
You didn't care about Danny,
did you? You just wanted me out.

01:27:03.971 --> 01:27:06.641
What do you care? He came
to me for a few extra quid.

01:27:06.642 --> 01:27:09.312
Danny did what he thought
was light for hls family.

01:27:09.313 --> 01:27:12.186
Hey, I thlnk It's time
for that holiday.

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:17.945
Why don't you just... 7

01:27:17.946 --> 01:27:20.443

01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:23.072
Now, you can do what you Ilka,
It's your llfe,

01:27:23.073 --> 01:27:25.906
but the bakery ls staying.

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:29.744
And so am I. So if...

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:32.623
If you wanna talk
about the future at all...

01:27:32.624 --> 01:27:34.716
perhaps we could do It
over dinner sometime.

01:27:38.962 --> 01:27:42.091
All rlght, Stephen?
Come on, son.

01:27:46.887 --> 01:27:49.388
Oh, and...

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:51.016

01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:57.566
This Isn't finished.
I'm raising your rent.

01:27:57.567 --> 01:27:58.690
You're going under.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:05.034
Well, If Naf's not going
anywhere, neither am I.

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:09.160
You're gonna let some old git

01:28:09.161 --> 01:28:12.754
and a black towelhead terrorist
take you down with them?

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:15.460
Race and religion
ls Irrelevant, Mr. Cotton.

01:28:15.461 --> 01:28:18.210
If you're a dickhead,
you're a dickhead. Bye-bye.

01:28:25.926 --> 01:28:27.348
I almost forgot.

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:32.141
- There you are.
- Thank you.

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:38.276
I didn't mean what I sald,

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.815
Yeah, and I don't thlnk

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:44.276

- Nothing.

01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:45.736
Hey, Nat.

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:48.953
Do you thlnk I'll still he able
to bake without...? You know.

01:28:48.954 --> 01:28:52.670
What you made In my kitchen
without any help was superb.

01:28:52.671 --> 01:28:55.037
Nat. Questions, questions.

01:28:55.038 --> 01:28:56.834
You're starting
to sound Ilka a Jew.

01:28:56.835 --> 01:28:58.379
All'! I Still OI'! Trial?

01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:04.380
A priest. A rabbl,
and an Imam go Into a pub.

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:05.803
The priest says,
"Have a drink with me.“

01:29:05.804 --> 01:29:08.177
The rabbl says,
"I don't mind lfl do.“

01:29:08.178 --> 01:29:10.723
The Imam says,
"I'd rather commit adultery...

01:29:10.724 --> 01:29:13.267
than allow alcohol
to pass my lips".

01:29:13.268 --> 01:29:16.565
And the rabbl says, "OI, I
didn't know I had the choice."

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:21.406
- Batter stick to baking, Nat.
- Yeah.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.874

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:35.708
Your father will be
turning In his grave.

01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:37.621

01:29:37.622 --> 01:29:40.207
