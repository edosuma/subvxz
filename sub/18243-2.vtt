Of course.
Always.

We've been having
a lot of family dinners

didn't work.

Could be.
I mean, these spells
aren't exactly science.

The Miso-Person's
was a vision spell.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.279
But let's think
outside the box.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.847
If Chuck's really as angry
as Grandma said he is,

12:40.934 --> 12:42.413
then that's
a strong emotion.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.155
So we should use
an emotional spell
to rout him out.

he and Grandma settle
their differences.

Chuck's gone forever,
and we did that.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.706
Good riddance.

21:56.793 --> 21:58.926
And to you, too.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.407
Stop!
Listen to yourselves.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.104
You used to be
friends.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.497
Best friends.

22:04.584 --> 22:05.933
Hard to imagine.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.065
Why are you
still fighting?

22:08.152 --> 22:11.591
Especially now that
you have everything
you've ever wanted.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.854
Mama P,
you live in Paris.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.030
Miss Silvers,
you can play piano
in public again,

22:16.117 --> 22:19.555
and Grandma Becky,
you're back with
your family.

22:19.642 --> 22:21.252
I don't understand.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.471
It's complicated.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.386
Look at you.

22:24.473 --> 22:27.607
You're all still cursed
but not by magic.

22:27.694 --> 22:28.782
Until you can
forgive each other,

22:28.869 --> 22:30.610
you're never
gonna be happy.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.263
We thought the
problem at your door

22:32.351 --> 22:34.788
you can't ignore
was Mama P,
but it's not.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.660
It's the three of you
and your own unhappiness,

22:37.747 --> 22:40.489
and... that's really sad.

22:40.576 --> 22:41.795
[knocking]

22:41.882 --> 22:43.362
Can unhappiness
knock at the door?

22:48.018 --> 22:48.976
Chuck?

22:49.063 --> 22:50.064
Both: Chuck?

22:50.151 --> 22:51.457
Chuck.
