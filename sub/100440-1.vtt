00:13.055 --> 00:14.984

00:29.930 --> 00:32.430
Sir Isaac Newton's law
of inertia states that

00:32.433 --> 00:35.330
an object in motion will stay
in motion unless acted upon

00:35.333 --> 00:37.533
by an unbalanced force.

00:37.535 --> 00:41.020
Meaning: your life can be
going one way, and at any moment

00:41.023 --> 00:43.672
something can happen to
bounce you in a new direction.

00:43.674 --> 00:47.184
Like if you lose your job
as an elite covert operative

00:47.187 --> 00:49.278
in a government task force,

00:49.280 --> 00:50.913
you can end up, well...

00:50.915 --> 00:52.615
here.

00:52.617 --> 00:55.317
"Knowing is not enough, we must apply.

00:55.319 --> 00:57.787
Being willing is not
enough, we must do."

00:57.789 --> 01:00.156
Da Vinci said that.

01:00.158 --> 01:03.160
He was trying to tell us
that diagnosing the problem...

01:04.194 --> 01:06.062
...it's only the first step.

01:06.064 --> 01:07.696
The most important step

01:07.698 --> 01:09.265
is taking action.

01:15.674 --> 01:17.207
Knowing isn't enough.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.442
So what, then, does it take

01:19.444 --> 01:21.811
to actually do something?

01:21.813 --> 01:24.246
To stop watching...

01:24.248 --> 01:25.671
and take action?

01:25.674 --> 01:27.584
First, you have to...

01:30.455 --> 01:31.588
...wake up.

01:32.924 --> 01:34.257
Welcome back.

01:57.014 --> 02:00.250
Class dismissed.

02:01.552 --> 02:04.286
Remember, Michealson,
chapter four and five for...

02:04.288 --> 02:06.056
next week.

03:09.987 --> 03:11.554
Nice moves, Professor.

03:12.557 --> 03:14.690
- Who the hell are you?
- Easy.

03:14.692 --> 03:16.187
I just wanted to chat.

03:16.190 --> 03:17.757
Why are you following me?

03:19.130 --> 03:20.729
My name's Russ.

03:20.731 --> 03:22.331
Russ Taylor.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.100
Very pleased to meet you, Angus.

03:25.102 --> 03:27.836
As in Spearhead Operations Russ Taylor?

03:27.838 --> 03:29.738
Oh, my reputation precedes me.

03:29.740 --> 03:33.008
Yeah. It does, and it's not a good look.

03:33.010 --> 03:34.743
Black budget ops,
destabilizing governments,

03:34.745 --> 03:37.079
protecting dictators...
all for profit, by the way.

03:37.081 --> 03:39.094
I know enough to know I
want nothing to do with you.

03:39.096 --> 03:41.223
Oh, that's my old résumé.
I'm in a new line of work now.

03:41.225 --> 03:42.424
Oh, what is that?

03:42.427 --> 03:43.852
Yours.

03:43.854 --> 03:46.607
I mean, not the, uh,
not the coeds, the...

03:46.610 --> 03:48.043
thesis papers.

03:48.046 --> 03:50.593
The... saving-the-world thing, that one.

03:50.595 --> 03:52.928
Not my line of work anymore. Long story.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.797
Well, not really. Once upon a time,

03:54.799 --> 03:56.872
the Phoenix Foundation was infiltrated

03:56.875 --> 04:00.457
by an ex-FBI psycho,
resulting in it being defunded

04:00.460 --> 04:02.705
and shut down, and now your entire team

04:02.707 --> 04:05.968
is living in a red-tape limbo of regret

04:05.971 --> 04:07.906
and ramen noodles.

04:08.879 --> 04:10.379
Oh, careful.

04:10.381 --> 04:12.434
You almost looked impressed there.

04:12.437 --> 04:14.250
Never had a stalker before.

04:14.252 --> 04:15.985
I have an eye for talent.

04:15.987 --> 04:17.685
And you...

04:17.688 --> 04:20.522
are the very best at what you do.

04:20.524 --> 04:22.758
Go find the second best. I'm...

04:22.760 --> 04:24.098
shaping young minds here.

04:24.101 --> 04:26.061
And besides, if I was
gonna get back in the game,

04:26.063 --> 04:28.397
it wouldn't be with a
profiteering con artist like you.

04:28.399 --> 04:29.632
Goodbye.

04:29.634 --> 04:31.667
What if I were to tell you that...

04:31.669 --> 04:34.604
thousands of innocent
lives are at stake?

04:47.156 --> 04:48.922
Oh, I like it!

04:48.925 --> 04:51.025
Very nervous-breakdown chic.

04:51.028 --> 04:52.395
Very now.

04:53.257 --> 04:55.324
I don't get a whole lot of visitors.

04:55.326 --> 04:57.192
Well, how can you tell?

04:57.194 --> 04:59.728
They could be anywhere.

04:59.730 --> 05:02.298
Okay, you've got until I finish this.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.809
And fair warning:

05:03.812 --> 05:06.468
they go down pretty quick these days.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.270
- Hey!
- Oh, it's all

05:08.272 --> 05:09.972
just part of the presentation.

05:09.974 --> 05:11.473
So...

05:11.475 --> 05:13.809
your thing...

05:13.811 --> 05:17.112
is... improvisation.

05:17.114 --> 05:19.708
Given a problem, you will throw a bit

05:19.711 --> 05:21.278
of science at it, a bit of elbow grease,

05:21.280 --> 05:22.645
and you always find a solution.

05:22.648 --> 05:24.937
Me, I can always find the problem.

05:24.940 --> 05:26.289
The missing ingredient.

05:26.292 --> 05:28.357
The squeaky wheel. Whatever
you want to call it.

05:28.359 --> 05:31.026
I recognize patterns in the world.

05:31.028 --> 05:32.394
I have what's called...

05:32.396 --> 05:33.729
Pareidolia.

05:33.731 --> 05:35.676
Hyper-pattern recognition.
You see connections

05:35.679 --> 05:37.399
where there aren't any. It's a disorder.

05:37.401 --> 05:39.134
You say disorder, I say tomato.

05:39.136 --> 05:41.337
Sure, some people can look at a...

05:41.339 --> 05:43.038
piece of toast and
see the Virgin Mary...

05:43.040 --> 05:44.093
But not you, right?

05:44.096 --> 05:45.728
I see...

05:45.731 --> 05:47.442
patterns...

05:47.445 --> 05:49.345
on a global scale.

05:49.347 --> 05:52.769
Shipping lanes... legal, not so legal.

05:52.772 --> 05:55.043
Flight patterns. Political disputes.

05:55.046 --> 05:58.926
Warlords shifting sides. Black
money market transactions.

05:58.929 --> 06:00.723
But recently,

06:00.725 --> 06:01.924
there's a new signal

06:01.926 --> 06:03.058
in the noise.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.638
You know what you sound like now, right?

06:04.640 --> 06:07.028
Someone is planning something.

06:07.031 --> 06:09.312
Someone big, with even bigger thumbs,

06:09.315 --> 06:10.981
pushing down on the scales.

06:10.984 --> 06:11.867
Well, that's great.

06:11.869 --> 06:13.902
You should take this to
the intelligence community.

06:13.904 --> 06:15.367
CIA, NSA.

06:15.370 --> 06:17.005
Somebody still in this line of work.

06:17.008 --> 06:19.426
Oh, you mean like the people
who shut down the Phoenix.

06:19.429 --> 06:21.343
Hmm? What?

06:21.345 --> 06:22.878
You never thought of that?

06:22.880 --> 06:24.835
All that red tape
preventing your friends

06:24.838 --> 06:26.247
from getting government positions?

06:26.250 --> 06:27.617
What are you saying?

06:30.051 --> 06:31.551
Whoever's behind this

06:31.554 --> 06:34.123
has their tendrils in
every major organization,

06:34.126 --> 06:36.555
both here and abroad, not
to mention my own company.

06:36.558 --> 06:37.724
I don't know who I can trust.

06:37.727 --> 06:39.625
I'm an outsider, like you.

06:41.254 --> 06:42.520
Well, Russ,

06:42.523 --> 06:43.989
I'm dry here, so...

06:43.992 --> 06:46.460
There is going to be an attack.

06:50.908 --> 06:52.708
A bioweapon...

06:52.710 --> 06:56.278
featuring a next-gen
version of a botulinum toxin

06:56.280 --> 06:59.114
was recently sold on the black market,

06:59.116 --> 07:01.502
and as you know, just
one gram of the stuff...

07:01.505 --> 07:02.851
Could kill thousands.

07:02.853 --> 07:05.954
Whoever bought it intends to use it.

07:05.956 --> 07:07.689
And none of the intelligence agencies

07:07.691 --> 07:09.658
are looking into it.

07:09.660 --> 07:12.080
It'll look like domestic terrorism,

07:12.083 --> 07:13.459
but it won't be.

07:13.462 --> 07:14.979
It's part of something bigger.

07:14.982 --> 07:16.765
This is real.

07:16.767 --> 07:19.302
I figure we have 72 hours at best.

07:21.974 --> 07:23.307
MacGyver.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.641
You don't have to trust me.

07:25.643 --> 07:27.976
Trust the intel.

07:27.978 --> 07:31.014
Will you help me stop this?

07:34.652 --> 07:36.785
It's got to be my team.

07:36.787 --> 07:38.587
I was counting on it.

07:38.589 --> 07:40.789
They'll take some convincing.

07:40.791 --> 07:42.157
Well, Angus,

07:42.159 --> 07:44.494
you'd better get a move on.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.147
All right, sir.

07:55.149 --> 07:57.450
Your hard drive was corrupted.

07:57.452 --> 08:00.186
But good news: I was
able to save your data.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.445
Now, part of the problem

08:01.448 --> 08:03.649
was the 900 gigabytes of...

08:03.652 --> 08:05.358
media...

08:05.360 --> 08:07.193
that was in the "tax folder,"

08:07.195 --> 08:09.996
which we both know was
definitely not tax-related.

08:09.998 --> 08:12.398
So I was able to put all of that

08:12.400 --> 08:13.700
on this thumb drive.

08:14.736 --> 08:16.136
Enjoy.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.710
- Mac.
- Riles.

08:33.587 --> 08:35.287
It's been a while.

08:35.289 --> 08:38.595
Yeah, we did a pretty crappy
job of keeping in touch, huh?

08:38.597 --> 08:40.793
I heard you were teaching now.

08:40.796 --> 08:42.294
You good?

08:42.296 --> 08:43.659
Mm...

08:43.663 --> 08:45.064
'Cause I'm not.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.559
I'm-I'm not good.

08:46.562 --> 08:48.601
At all. Mm.

08:48.603 --> 08:49.668
Well, you look good.

08:49.670 --> 08:51.370
You know, not a lot of people

08:51.372 --> 08:52.981
can pull off grape.

08:52.984 --> 08:55.441
Yeah. Best I could do
after the Phoenix folded.

08:55.443 --> 08:58.244
With all the red tape, I
can't near another G-job again.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.246
So don't hate on the grape.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.480
No hate.

09:01.482 --> 09:03.516
I'm in no position to judge. Promise.

09:03.518 --> 09:05.018
What are you doing here, man?

09:07.455 --> 09:08.864
It's a job.

09:08.867 --> 09:10.202
Hear me out.

09:10.205 --> 09:12.057
It's not Phoenix.

09:12.060 --> 09:13.559
It's gonna be dangerous.

09:13.561 --> 09:14.995
I quit!

09:17.198 --> 09:19.663
I'm in! Hundred percent. Yes!

09:20.635 --> 09:23.135
You see, I was laid off.

09:23.137 --> 09:25.838
Found myself without a job
for the first time in a while,

09:25.840 --> 09:27.006
so...

09:27.008 --> 09:28.974
I decided to go for it.

09:28.976 --> 09:31.444
Max out my Visa, call every favor in...

09:31.446 --> 09:33.446
and make a movie.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.814
No.

09:34.816 --> 09:36.248
Make a film.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.350
Love + Gun + Die.

09:38.352 --> 09:39.528
And now...

09:39.531 --> 09:41.387
here I am.

09:41.389 --> 09:43.722
How does it feel to follow your dreams

09:43.724 --> 09:45.591
and stick the landing?

09:45.593 --> 09:47.226
Well, Mandy...

09:47.228 --> 09:48.795
I have to say...

09:50.131 --> 09:51.484
...there are worse things.

09:59.674 --> 10:01.841
Uh, would you excuse me for a moment?

10:01.843 --> 10:03.077
- Sure.
- Ah, thanks.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.542
- Uh, hold this for me?
- Oh.

10:04.545 --> 10:06.846
- Don't sip it.
- Oh.

10:06.849 --> 10:09.774
Mac! It's great to see you,
but now is not a good time, man.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.888
- I'm trying to seal another deal...
- Yeah, I... This is urgent.

10:11.890 --> 10:13.219
Like "science teacher" urgent?

10:13.221 --> 10:17.022
Professor. And no,
like "old days" urgent.

10:17.024 --> 10:18.491
Like "high school old days" urgent?

10:18.493 --> 10:19.525
Bozer.

10:19.527 --> 10:20.793
"Phoenix old days,"

10:20.795 --> 10:22.428
like life-and-death kind of stuff.

10:22.430 --> 10:23.729
Oh.

10:23.731 --> 10:24.763
No.

10:24.765 --> 10:26.065
No? What? No?

10:26.067 --> 10:28.367
As in N-O. Okay? Why
am I gonna put myself

10:28.369 --> 10:30.340
in their hands again when
they hung us out to dry?

10:30.343 --> 10:31.237
There's no "they."

10:31.239 --> 10:33.038
It's not the old Phoenix, it's just me.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.473
You trust me, right?

10:34.475 --> 10:35.975
Of course.

10:35.978 --> 10:37.317
But I'm on a press tour.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.178
For my movie.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.313
Mine. You know how long
I've waited for that?

10:41.315 --> 10:43.549
Help me, Bozie-Wan Kenobi.

10:43.551 --> 10:44.783
You're my only hope.

10:44.785 --> 10:46.983
Don't Episode IV me,
that's A New Hope, man.

10:46.986 --> 10:48.052
That's sacred.

10:48.055 --> 10:49.889
It's that serious.

10:52.493 --> 10:54.109
Come on, man.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.594
Hey, so what about Matty? We need Matty.

10:56.597 --> 10:57.930
Russ Taylor already approached her,

10:57.932 --> 10:59.198
and she said no, I guess.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.366
After the Phoenix, she said she was done

11:00.368 --> 11:01.534
with this line of work.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.868
So, dare I ask?

11:02.870 --> 11:05.271
Well, I'm gonna go after Desi next.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.373
Come on. It's fine. We're professionals.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.341
We... People work with
their exes all the time.

11:09.343 --> 11:10.327
Uh, no, they don't,

11:10.330 --> 11:12.444
especially not after
breakups as nuclear as yours.

11:12.446 --> 11:14.313
It wasn't nuclear, it was just messy.

11:14.315 --> 11:16.106
Man, this ought to be good.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.169
Okay. Well, things may have
gotten a little complicated

11:18.171 --> 11:19.685
between me and Desi, but I have no doubt

11:19.687 --> 11:21.702
she'll be mature about it
and jump right on board.

11:21.705 --> 11:24.856
♪ She got that good, good love,
she got that bad attitude ♪

11:24.859 --> 11:26.770
♪ She got that je ne sais quoi ♪

11:26.773 --> 11:28.928
♪ She got that boom, boom, boom... ♪

11:28.930 --> 11:30.629
No. No way, dude.

11:30.631 --> 11:32.264
The things we know about each other.

11:32.266 --> 11:33.699
The things we did to each other?

11:33.701 --> 11:35.267
It's a terrible idea, Mac.

11:35.269 --> 11:37.136
We can pull it together for one mission.

11:37.138 --> 11:39.872
You've faced far worse than
me in your years of service.

11:39.874 --> 11:41.073
Have I?

11:41.075 --> 11:43.609
Your adolescent obsession with '80s pop.

11:43.612 --> 11:45.643
Your terrible taste in movies.

11:45.646 --> 11:47.817
That gurgling, choking snore sound

11:47.820 --> 11:49.117
you do at 3:00 in the morning.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.354
Well, I was lucky to be snoring

11:50.356 --> 11:52.116
with your roll-over punches to the face.

11:52.119 --> 11:54.486
See? We can't do this.

11:54.488 --> 11:56.255
Desi, lives are at stake.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.490
Don't talk to me like that.

11:58.492 --> 12:00.259
- Hey, you jerk.
- Leave the lady alone.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.495
Excuse me, Mac, I have to go to work.

12:03.497 --> 12:05.231
Could I get your phone number?

12:05.233 --> 12:06.799
Sir,

12:06.801 --> 12:09.435
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

12:12.039 --> 12:14.607
- ♪ Girls ♪
- ♪ We love to make you jam ♪

12:14.609 --> 12:16.609
♪ We love to play and to have fun ♪

12:16.612 --> 12:18.711
♪ We love to pop your bubble ♪

12:18.713 --> 12:20.480
♪ Break it down, you better run. ♪

12:26.065 --> 12:28.419
And I know things may not have
ended on the greatest terms

12:28.422 --> 12:29.989
between us, but now is a chance

12:29.991 --> 12:31.523
for us to do something good again.

12:31.525 --> 12:33.559
Come on.

12:33.561 --> 12:35.160
Bouncing thugs out of clubs

12:35.162 --> 12:37.663
may scratch the itch
a little bit, but...

12:37.665 --> 12:40.218
Tell me you don't miss the action.

12:44.953 --> 12:46.386
Ladies and gentleman,

12:46.389 --> 12:48.306
the clock is ticking, let's get started.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.309
You sure about this guy?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.844
No.

12:51.846 --> 12:55.442
Question. If you're Mr.
Super Rich Guy Gun-For-Hire,

12:55.445 --> 12:57.284
then why are we all
crammed into this house

12:57.287 --> 12:58.435
like an episode of Hoarders?

12:58.438 --> 12:59.505
Because as far as I know,

12:59.507 --> 13:01.186
my facilities have been compromised.

13:01.188 --> 13:03.484
I came to you because you are the best,

13:03.487 --> 13:05.658
but also because you've
been out of the game,

13:05.660 --> 13:07.326
so I know you're all clean.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.462
Now, let's get down to business.

13:10.731 --> 13:12.762
This is Lazlo Carver.

13:12.765 --> 13:14.898
Black market arms dealer.

13:14.901 --> 13:17.568
Recently graduated to Red Tier items.

13:17.571 --> 13:20.473
- Red Tier?
- Weapons deadly on a mass scale.

13:21.207 --> 13:24.475
Hades X1. Aptly named.

13:24.478 --> 13:26.476
This is an experimental bioweapon,

13:26.479 --> 13:29.413
featuring and next-gen
version of botulinum toxin.

13:29.416 --> 13:31.816
Just a gram of this stuff could wipe out

13:31.819 --> 13:33.585
the entire population of any major city

13:33.587 --> 13:34.913
within a matter of days.

13:34.916 --> 13:36.799
So let's go get this Carver
guy before he sells it

13:36.801 --> 13:38.501
to some psychopath who wants to use it.

13:38.504 --> 13:41.242
Unfortunately, no. Carver
already sold it a week ago.

13:42.682 --> 13:44.429
I'm guessing we don't know the buyer.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.098
No, but we need to figure it out fast,

13:46.100 --> 13:48.679
because Hades has a
very short shelf life.

13:48.682 --> 13:51.496
Whoever bought it is gonna want
to use it in the next 36 hours.

13:51.499 --> 13:53.110
Tonight, Carver is holding

13:53.113 --> 13:54.746
an auction for recent acquisitions

13:54.749 --> 13:57.031
from his compound in Mexico City.

13:57.034 --> 13:59.468
The place will be crawling
with criminal types.

13:59.471 --> 14:02.090
Terrorists, dictators,
the worst of the worst.

14:02.093 --> 14:03.916
All hoping to stock up.

14:03.918 --> 14:05.617
Now, Carver has a digital ledger

14:05.619 --> 14:07.953
where he keeps all his customers' info.

14:07.955 --> 14:11.290
IDs, bank account transfers, the works.

14:11.292 --> 14:12.925
And you want us to go undercover

14:12.927 --> 14:15.861
as criminal glitterati,
sneak in, steal the ledger,

14:15.863 --> 14:17.596
and find out who he sold the weapon to.

14:17.599 --> 14:19.098
Yes. But the problem is,

14:19.101 --> 14:20.065
we can't just steal it

14:20.067 --> 14:21.100
without spooking Carver,

14:21.102 --> 14:22.501
who will then alert his buyers.

14:22.503 --> 14:24.007
We need to copy it.

14:24.010 --> 14:25.636
I'll figure out a way to interface

14:25.639 --> 14:27.656
a short-range transmitter to the ledger,

14:27.659 --> 14:29.308
and then I'll upload the rest to Riley.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.004
The ledger itself will be encrypted;

14:31.007 --> 14:32.312
probably several layers' worth.

14:32.315 --> 14:33.657
Now, Bozer, you're gonna be running

14:33.659 --> 14:35.880
the entire operation from here.

14:35.883 --> 14:37.695
We don't have Matty watching our backs,

14:37.698 --> 14:39.132
so it's all up to you.

14:39.135 --> 14:40.568
Ms. Davis will crack the ledger,

14:40.570 --> 14:42.312
and we'll find out who the buyer is.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.288
And stop them before
they use that thing.

14:45.291 --> 14:47.992
All right, Bozer, we are in.

14:47.995 --> 14:49.340
Copy that, Alpha Team.

14:49.343 --> 14:50.629
Bravo Team, report status.

14:50.631 --> 14:51.630
In position.

14:51.632 --> 14:53.176
Short-range wireless up and running.

14:53.179 --> 14:54.023
Copy that.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.390
Mac is on the hunt for the ledger.

14:55.393 --> 14:56.802
When he finds it, he'll upload the data

14:56.804 --> 14:58.418
straight to you, nobody's the wiser.

14:58.421 --> 15:00.572
Nobody being the wiser is key.

15:00.574 --> 15:02.574
If Carver even gets a whiff of dirty,

15:02.576 --> 15:05.477
he'll lock this place down,
and we'll all be dead in five.

15:05.479 --> 15:07.980
Relax. This is not our first rodeo.

15:07.982 --> 15:10.484
Why is it always a rodeo?

15:10.487 --> 15:12.683
If this were an actual
rodeo, it would be my first.

15:12.686 --> 15:14.987
You know, I've never
actually been to the rodeo...

15:14.989 --> 15:17.322
Ooh, hors d'oeuvres.

15:17.324 --> 15:19.210
Tell me again why we trust this guy.

15:19.213 --> 15:20.782
Because the intel is sound.

15:20.785 --> 15:23.461
Just trust in that, if you can.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.631
It looks like I have a fan.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.067
Well, in that dress there
will be no shortage of those.

15:29.069 --> 15:31.403
You were always so good with flattery.

15:31.406 --> 15:32.573
Until you weren't.

15:34.341 --> 15:37.121
Awkward. Okay, guys,

15:37.124 --> 15:39.090
look sharp, the show's about to start.

15:39.093 --> 15:40.364
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:40.367 --> 15:42.748
our items are being prepared for display

15:42.750 --> 15:44.650
as we speak.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.686
We'll be ready to begin in
just a few short minutes.

15:57.431 --> 15:59.731
Ledger's on the move.

15:59.734 --> 16:02.635
Yeah, I've got eyes. I'm following now.

16:12.238 --> 16:15.272
All right, I've got eyes on the ledger,

16:15.282 --> 16:17.249
but it's in the auction room.

16:17.251 --> 16:18.801
Like, where everyone's about to go?

16:18.804 --> 16:20.586
Yeah. You guys need to keep everybody

16:20.588 --> 16:22.817
up in the reception area
for a couple more minutes.

16:22.820 --> 16:24.356
Riley...

16:24.358 --> 16:25.858
what about a lights out?

16:25.860 --> 16:27.226
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:27.228 --> 16:29.051
Carver's got everything hard-wired.

16:29.054 --> 16:30.462
There's nothing to hack into.

16:30.464 --> 16:31.831
I've got an idea.

16:39.835 --> 16:42.740
_

16:42.743 --> 16:45.515
Don't touch me with your
filthy, unworthy hands!

16:45.518 --> 16:47.648
_

16:52.031 --> 16:55.287
Mac, Operation Distraction in action.

17:01.862 --> 17:05.897
Okay, the case is open. Riley...

17:05.900 --> 17:07.766
prepare for upload.

17:07.768 --> 17:10.903
Uh-oh. We, uh...

17:10.905 --> 17:12.237
have a slight problem.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.605
Looks like Carver is,

17:13.607 --> 17:15.406
uh, a little old school.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.035
Like pen and paper old school.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.811
Uh, okay, just-just read it back to me.

17:20.814 --> 17:22.233
- I'll record it.
- No.

17:22.237 --> 17:23.582
These are codes and
symbols. I'm not really sure

17:23.584 --> 17:24.750
what I'm looking at here.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.913
And I don't have a
cell phone or a camera

17:26.915 --> 17:28.015
to take a picture of it.

17:28.017 --> 17:29.552
All right, just-just get
the ledger back to me.

17:29.554 --> 17:30.622
I can decrypt it.

17:30.624 --> 17:31.623
Hang on a second.

17:31.625 --> 17:32.859
If that ledger goes missing,

17:32.862 --> 17:34.309
Carver alerts all of his customers,

17:34.312 --> 17:36.129
and the buyer goes underground.

17:37.367 --> 17:38.997
So we need to make a copy.

17:38.999 --> 17:40.033
Right.

17:51.879 --> 17:54.012
Ink is essentially a chemical residue

17:54.014 --> 17:56.782
left on paper in neat little
shapes that we can read.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.249
You can transfer it
either by getting it wet,

17:59.252 --> 18:01.687
or by using a lot of heat.

18:05.992 --> 18:09.694
Whoa, hold on. Turns out
there is something I can hack.

18:22.257 --> 18:23.817
Mac, you've got incoming.

18:23.820 --> 18:24.844
You gotta buy me more time.

18:24.846 --> 18:26.278
I just need a few more pages.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.570
Copy that.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.452
MAN ; Jose, Luis...

19:02.249 --> 19:04.349
Eh, it's the fire alarm.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.884
Let's go. Everyone.

19:07.073 --> 19:09.053
Let go, out the front door.

19:09.056 --> 19:10.822
Out.

19:10.824 --> 19:12.991
Let's go. Out the front door.

19:12.993 --> 19:15.628
Did we get it?

19:23.479 --> 19:26.007
Oh, yeah, we got it.

19:27.975 --> 19:30.609
I've got a house nearby
we can hole up in.

19:30.611 --> 19:33.513
It's not much, but mi casa, su casa.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.317
Carver used a classic
polyalphabetic code.

19:39.319 --> 19:42.321
Pretty easy to crack if you're... me.

19:46.326 --> 19:47.770
Let me get you some ice for that.

19:47.773 --> 19:49.495
I'll be right back.

19:50.998 --> 19:54.099
Looks like our bioweapon buyer
has a name: Martin Bishop.

19:54.101 --> 19:55.312
Ton of hits.

19:55.315 --> 19:57.365
Run it through the list of
the usual Agency databases

19:57.367 --> 19:58.938
and see what you can dig up.

20:00.554 --> 20:01.807
There's something else.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.375
What? What's wrong?

20:03.377 --> 20:07.946
Carver used a patent number
to identify the Hades X1.

20:07.948 --> 20:09.648
But that number also corresponds

20:09.650 --> 20:12.584
to a patent owned by...

20:12.586 --> 20:14.120
Spearhead Operations.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.945
- That's...
- Taylor's company.

20:18.816 --> 20:20.562
He's been playing us.

20:23.167 --> 20:26.821
Spearhead Operations! That
thing, that bioweapon is yours!

20:26.824 --> 20:30.527
Yeah, well, there may have been
something I forgot to mention.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.463
We are risking our lives
to clean up your mess?

20:32.466 --> 20:36.024
This was a contract I
should never have taken.

20:36.027 --> 20:39.675
A bioweapon meant to
neutralize populations

20:39.678 --> 20:42.750
without destroying geographical assets.

20:42.753 --> 20:44.920
Neutralize?

20:44.922 --> 20:46.255
You mean murder.

20:46.258 --> 20:49.994
Yes. Yes.

20:54.497 --> 20:56.497
Not all of us are...

20:56.500 --> 20:58.734
are born heroes.

20:58.736 --> 21:00.736
I just wanted to do something important.

21:00.738 --> 21:02.971
After MI6, that led me to...

21:02.973 --> 21:05.040
private military contracts and...

21:05.042 --> 21:07.443
and making some...

21:07.445 --> 21:09.478
some difficult...

21:09.480 --> 21:10.980
decisions.

21:12.850 --> 21:15.918
I told myself that...

21:15.920 --> 21:18.521
it was all for the greater good.

21:20.057 --> 21:22.358
I got rich...

21:22.360 --> 21:24.426
monetizing...

21:24.436 --> 21:27.205
the one constant of civilization.

21:28.532 --> 21:30.667
Human conflict.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.695
The poor man wants to be rich,

21:34.698 --> 21:37.732
the rich man wants to be king...

21:37.735 --> 21:41.242
and the king isn't satisfied until...

21:41.245 --> 21:43.545
he rules everything.

21:43.547 --> 21:45.214
Let me guess: Sun Tzu.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.216
Springsteen.

21:48.511 --> 21:50.253
Look, I... I know

21:50.256 --> 21:53.154
I've made mistakes, but this is...

21:53.157 --> 21:55.769
this is not the life I want, I...

21:55.772 --> 21:58.459
It's not the legacy I
want to leave behind.

21:58.462 --> 22:00.629
Lie to us again, and this is over.

22:01.799 --> 22:04.203
Hey, guys? Our
interagency cross-reference

22:04.206 --> 22:05.901
just got a hit on the buyer.

22:05.903 --> 22:07.736
We've got a potential Martin Bishop.

22:07.738 --> 22:10.072
But this file is weird. It's-it's, like...

22:10.074 --> 22:11.273
It's classified.

22:11.275 --> 22:12.508
Who is this guy?

22:12.510 --> 22:14.180
Yeah, what is Canopy?

22:14.183 --> 22:15.620
I-I don't know.

22:15.623 --> 22:17.445
I mean, this is a
level of classification

22:17.448 --> 22:18.747
I've never even seen before.

22:18.749 --> 22:20.549
Yeah, I've never heard
of Canopy, either.

22:20.551 --> 22:22.878
But I'll bet you we
know someone who has.

22:23.594 --> 22:25.527
I'm here to talk to you today

22:25.530 --> 22:27.755
about Atilla the Hun.

22:27.758 --> 22:31.844
During his reign, Atilla was
one of the most feared enemies

22:31.847 --> 22:35.125
of the Eastern and Western empires.

22:35.128 --> 22:37.328
Up there, you may see the face

22:37.331 --> 22:39.334
of a ruthless conqueror.

22:39.336 --> 22:40.769
But me?

22:40.771 --> 22:42.604
I see a pioneer.

22:42.606 --> 22:46.942
A pioneer who took a
band of misfit nomads

22:46.944 --> 22:49.211
and used them to conquer Europe.

22:49.213 --> 22:52.047
And so I ask you all this question:

22:52.049 --> 22:55.517
How do you unleash your inner Hun?

22:58.155 --> 22:59.755
What the hell's going on?

23:00.891 --> 23:03.146
Riley! It worked. I got her.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.649
Matty, thank God. Mac and
the team are in trouble.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.397
They're... Oh.

23:08.399 --> 23:10.566
That's a...

23:10.569 --> 23:12.097
that's a lot of people there.

23:14.653 --> 23:17.020
Taylor, what the hell are you doing

23:17.023 --> 23:18.706
- running my team?
- Look, you've been

23:18.709 --> 23:20.108
out of the game for over a year,

23:20.110 --> 23:21.789
and in that time a lot has happened.

23:21.792 --> 23:23.260
Notre Dame's caught fire,

23:23.263 --> 23:25.719
Accrington Stanley got
promoted from Division Two,

23:25.722 --> 23:27.649
and... oh, that's right...
I run your team now.

23:27.651 --> 23:30.319
Oh, and you are crushing it.

23:30.321 --> 23:33.422
Running an unsanctioned op so mismanaged

23:33.424 --> 23:36.157
that you allowed an
apocalyptic bioweapon

23:36.160 --> 23:37.659
to slip through your fingers.

23:37.661 --> 23:38.917
You're great.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.462
We really need your help.

23:40.464 --> 23:42.352
Well, it's nice to know I'm your backup.

23:42.355 --> 23:43.899
You said she was retired.

23:43.901 --> 23:45.634
Well, technically, she
wouldn't take my call.

23:45.636 --> 23:47.002
No one takes your calls.

23:47.004 --> 23:48.058
Well, then, that's that.

23:48.061 --> 23:49.907
No, no, no. Not "that's that."

23:49.910 --> 23:52.534
You are relying on your
lackluster reputation

23:52.537 --> 23:54.938
for me to blow you off
so that I wouldn't be here

23:54.941 --> 23:56.078
to challenge your authority.

23:56.081 --> 23:58.714
Well, now that you've finished
challenging my authority...

23:58.717 --> 24:00.742
Matty, we're on a tight time clock,

24:00.745 --> 24:02.746
and we really, really need your help.

24:03.475 --> 24:04.842
Right. Okay.

24:04.845 --> 24:06.370
Bozer gave me the name Martin Bishop.

24:06.373 --> 24:08.189
We think he's about
to release a bioweapon

24:08.192 --> 24:09.591
in a domestic attack.

24:09.593 --> 24:12.194
- We need to be able to access his files.
- Well...

24:12.196 --> 24:14.963
like the rest of you,
I lost my clearance.

24:14.965 --> 24:17.004
But lucky for you, I was able to pull

24:17.007 --> 24:19.823
whatever strings I have
left, which is how I managed

24:19.826 --> 24:21.426
to get...

24:21.429 --> 24:22.628
voilá...

24:22.631 --> 24:23.697
the dossier

24:23.700 --> 24:24.933
of Martin Bishop.

24:24.936 --> 24:26.675
Canopy is

24:26.677 --> 24:30.145
the top secret security
designation for DXS,

24:30.147 --> 24:31.780
which at one time was...

24:31.782 --> 24:33.181
Phoenix.

24:33.183 --> 24:34.730
So Bishop was one of us?

24:34.733 --> 24:36.652
He was before our time.

24:36.654 --> 24:38.085
Before Oversight.

24:38.088 --> 24:40.488
He was you, Mac. A brilliant, young mind

24:40.491 --> 24:43.392
paired with a soldier using
science to save the world.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.832
I was wondering why I had
never heard about him before.

24:45.835 --> 24:48.463
But then I realized why.

24:48.465 --> 24:49.831
He's a dead man.

24:49.833 --> 24:52.483
KIA 2006, Budapest.

24:52.486 --> 24:54.119
But guess what?

24:54.122 --> 24:56.715
No body was ever
recovered. He's a faker.

24:56.718 --> 24:58.176
So our terrorist is a ghost.

24:58.179 --> 24:59.308
With a bioweapon.

24:59.310 --> 25:01.010
How do we find him?

25:02.046 --> 25:03.845
We don't look for him.

25:03.847 --> 25:05.848
Then what do we look for?

25:07.984 --> 25:10.418
What he's trying to make.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.087
You said he was one of us, right?

25:12.089 --> 25:13.422
So Bishop has

25:13.424 --> 25:14.856
an engineering background.

25:14.858 --> 25:16.692
Hades is a bioweapon, sure.

25:16.694 --> 25:18.594
But it's just the toxin.
What it's missing is...

25:18.596 --> 25:20.362
Delivery system.

25:20.364 --> 25:22.030
Mac, how would you do it?

25:22.033 --> 25:23.667
Um...

25:24.702 --> 25:27.536
Some kind of rocket.

25:27.538 --> 25:29.037
But it couldn't be smuggled in.

25:29.039 --> 25:31.006
It would have to be
homemade. Off the grid.

25:31.008 --> 25:32.240
Bishop's got a list

25:32.242 --> 25:34.242
- of old aliases.
- He'd need a place

25:34.244 --> 25:36.178
- to assemble it.
- And materials.

25:36.180 --> 25:37.846
Liquid oxygen and kerosene.

25:37.848 --> 25:40.082
- Lots of it.
- Oh, check this out.

25:40.084 --> 25:42.217
A shipment of five
cubic meters of kerosene

25:42.219 --> 25:43.385
was delivered to a property

25:43.387 --> 25:45.699
off the Angeles Crest three weeks ago.

25:45.702 --> 25:47.923
The name of the property owner,

25:47.925 --> 25:49.257
Gregg Sallattem.

25:49.259 --> 25:51.061
That's one of Bishop's aliases.

25:51.064 --> 25:53.528
That means Los Angeles
could be the rocket's target.

25:53.530 --> 25:55.197
Okay, I'll call the Air
Force and have them prepare

25:55.199 --> 25:56.865
countermeasures against a rocket strike.

25:56.867 --> 25:58.266
Bozer, you're with me.

25:58.268 --> 26:01.194
- The rest of you, Angeles Crest.
- Get yourselves to Angeles Crest.

26:04.541 --> 26:06.296
What she said.

26:21.944 --> 26:23.791
This place is perfect for someone

26:23.794 --> 26:26.161
who wants to get off the
grid and stay off the grid.

26:26.163 --> 26:28.449
I'm hardly seeing any
heat signatures in here.

26:28.452 --> 26:29.665
Well, there's just one,

26:29.667 --> 26:31.768
in the northeast corner of the compound.

26:46.784 --> 26:48.950
This place is a mess.

26:48.952 --> 26:50.952
A window into his state of mind.

26:50.954 --> 26:53.890
This coming from Marie Kondo.

26:55.459 --> 26:56.958
Careful, Taylor.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.389
Lot of things in this place
don't react well to bullets.

27:09.139 --> 27:10.505
Don't move.

27:10.507 --> 27:12.474
Well.

27:12.476 --> 27:15.043
Certainly took you long enough.

27:15.045 --> 27:16.921
You know, when I was there,

27:16.924 --> 27:20.898
DXS had a reputation for
being fast and efficient.

27:20.901 --> 27:23.960
But not this whole Phoenix Foundation...

27:26.857 --> 27:28.024
Get up.

27:32.863 --> 27:34.563
Matty, we got him.

27:34.565 --> 27:36.031
No sign of the rocket, though.

27:36.033 --> 27:37.532
Surrounding area is clear,

27:37.534 --> 27:40.168
with the exception of
a structure 30 yards

27:40.170 --> 27:41.369
behind the compound.

27:41.371 --> 27:42.571
Copy that.

27:42.573 --> 27:43.905
Riley and I will go.

27:43.907 --> 27:46.509
Guys, good luck getting him to talk.

27:47.510 --> 27:49.877
You know, Bishop...

27:49.880 --> 27:52.881
I started my career in MI6.

27:52.883 --> 27:54.382
Psyops.

27:54.384 --> 27:57.519
I learned manipulation,

27:57.521 --> 28:01.225
propaganda, lie detection,

28:01.228 --> 28:03.157
interrogation.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.879
All super useful methods

28:04.882 --> 28:07.000
I'd later use to start my own company.

28:07.003 --> 28:10.371
But do you know what I found to
be the best source of motivation

28:10.374 --> 28:11.833
for all human beings?

28:11.835 --> 28:12.901
Hmm?

28:12.903 --> 28:14.136
Pain.

28:14.138 --> 28:16.705
Hmm.

28:16.707 --> 28:18.273
Hold on.

28:18.275 --> 28:19.541
We could do this your way

28:19.543 --> 28:21.843
or the dentist's office way.

28:21.845 --> 28:24.585
Oh, the dentist's office.
That sounds like a horror show.

28:55.545 --> 28:59.079
Nitrous oxide not only

28:59.082 --> 29:01.316
reduces the pain, but
it lowers inhibitions.

29:01.318 --> 29:02.651
And the reason that secrets

29:02.653 --> 29:05.538
are so hard to keep is
that people desperately

29:05.541 --> 29:07.140
want to tell them.

29:07.143 --> 29:09.056
They just need a little push.

29:24.408 --> 29:26.305
Well? Want to do the honors?

29:27.811 --> 29:29.607
I meant ask him questions!

29:29.610 --> 29:31.948
I know what you meant.

29:34.117 --> 29:35.784
Where's the rocket?

29:46.231 --> 29:48.708
They told me about you, MacGyver.

29:48.711 --> 29:51.366
You know, you and I aren't so different.

29:51.368 --> 29:52.834
I don't murder innocent people,

29:52.836 --> 29:54.603
so I don't think we're anything alike.

29:54.605 --> 29:57.873
Oh, it's not murder.

29:57.875 --> 30:00.008
We're saving them.

30:00.010 --> 30:02.544
"Them"? "We"? Who? Who do you work for?

30:02.546 --> 30:06.448
I work for everyone.

30:06.450 --> 30:09.317
I mean, look around,
man. The whole world

30:09.319 --> 30:10.821
is burning.

30:10.824 --> 30:12.224
It's flooding.

30:12.227 --> 30:15.624
We're starving and we're dying
while the people in power,

30:15.626 --> 30:17.493
they do nothing.

30:19.463 --> 30:22.005
DXS promised to save
the world through science

30:22.008 --> 30:25.009
and they failed, so I left.

30:25.012 --> 30:27.779
And I'm not the only one.

30:27.782 --> 30:31.506
There are others all over the world.

30:31.508 --> 30:34.242
And we're willing to do what you cannot.

30:34.244 --> 30:36.913
We're willing to do what's necessary.

30:40.284 --> 30:42.384
Guys, there's nothing
here. The place is empty.

30:42.386 --> 30:43.919
The rocket's been taken somewhere else.

30:43.921 --> 30:46.321
It's almost time.

30:46.323 --> 30:49.591
The pillars of society will fall.

30:49.593 --> 30:51.960
We're gonna burn it all to the ground.

30:51.962 --> 30:54.896
The thing is, being willing

30:54.898 --> 30:56.016
is not enough.

30:56.019 --> 30:58.098
You must do.

30:58.101 --> 31:00.669
And my question is,

31:00.671 --> 31:02.086
when the time comes,

31:02.089 --> 31:04.742
what will you do, Angus MacGyver?

31:11.348 --> 31:12.930
What's happening?

31:17.421 --> 31:19.120
Poisoned himself. It was the watch.

31:19.122 --> 31:20.255
He had it laced.

31:26.047 --> 31:28.743
Are there underground
tunnels on the property?

31:29.800 --> 31:31.443
Actually, you're over the aqueduct.

31:31.446 --> 31:32.467
There's an access

31:32.469 --> 31:34.438
at the east end of the compound.

31:46.183 --> 31:48.024
What are we missing here?

31:48.027 --> 31:49.438
That rumble was a launch.

31:49.441 --> 31:50.585
How can you

31:50.587 --> 31:52.489
launch a rocket underground?

31:52.492 --> 31:54.957
It wasn't a rocket. It was a torpedo.

31:55.875 --> 31:57.959
With Hades as its payload.

32:00.964 --> 32:02.931
If that thing detonates
in the center of the city,

32:02.933 --> 32:05.868
it'll shower the city with
toxin, and millions will die.

32:11.485 --> 32:13.986
Okay, let me get this
straight. As we speak,

32:13.989 --> 32:17.923
a GPS-equipped torpedo
is making its way through

32:17.926 --> 32:20.380
- L.A.'s underground water system?
- Exactly.

32:20.383 --> 32:21.627
The torpedo's in there somewhere,

32:21.629 --> 32:22.633
but there's one problem.

32:22.636 --> 32:23.996
There's thousands of miles of pipes.

32:23.998 --> 32:25.736
The torpedo's GPS has
to navigate through all

32:25.738 --> 32:27.172
- the connections.
- That gives us

32:27.174 --> 32:28.740
only 40 minutes to find it.

32:28.743 --> 32:30.644
Right, but if we're smart,
maybe we don't even have

32:30.646 --> 32:32.837
to search for it at all.
Think about it this way.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.664
In order to spread
toxins through the city,

32:34.667 --> 32:35.990
that torpedo needs to hit a target

32:35.992 --> 32:37.593
with above-ground water facilities.

32:37.596 --> 32:39.396
That way, the steam from the explosion

32:39.399 --> 32:40.579
can dissipate into the air.

32:40.581 --> 32:42.586
Best way to do that is one of LADWP's

32:42.589 --> 32:44.219
421 distribution stations.

32:44.222 --> 32:45.836
That's far too many.

32:45.839 --> 32:48.553
Maybe we can locate
the ones being targeted.

32:48.556 --> 32:49.805
'Cause the good news is,

32:49.808 --> 32:52.414
that torpedo has a
massive toxin payload.

32:52.417 --> 32:53.711
And explain "good news."

32:53.714 --> 32:56.160
Okay, water distribution
stations... they vary in size,

32:56.163 --> 32:58.938
depending on geography
and local water needs,

32:58.941 --> 33:00.933
which means the pipes also vary in size.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.468
Okay. I see where you're going.

33:02.470 --> 33:04.803
Hacking the DWP to get the diameter

33:04.805 --> 33:07.039
of all pipes heading
toward those stations.

33:07.041 --> 33:09.775
And from the launch site, I can
estimate the torpedo's diameter.

33:09.777 --> 33:12.644
All right, Bozer, pipe
measurements coming your way.

33:12.646 --> 33:15.314
Got it. Eliminating all stations

33:15.316 --> 33:17.850
where the pipes are too small
for the torpedo to pass through.

33:17.852 --> 33:19.969
Okay, that leaves 12 stations

33:19.972 --> 33:22.106
with pipes wide enough
to fit that thing.

33:27.746 --> 33:30.146
These stations are on
the outskirts of the city.

33:30.149 --> 33:32.683
To kill a lot of people, you
need to aim for the center.

33:32.686 --> 33:34.999
Right there. Station 253.

33:35.002 --> 33:36.402
Smack dab in Downtown.

33:36.404 --> 33:37.736
The pipes heading toward that station

33:37.738 --> 33:39.104
have elevated water levels.

33:39.106 --> 33:40.739
Because the torpedo is displacing water.

33:40.741 --> 33:41.649
That's the target.

33:41.652 --> 33:42.886
Okay, so that's all very impressive,

33:42.888 --> 33:44.354
but how do you stop it?

33:48.633 --> 33:52.383
Riley, find the closest concrete plant.

33:52.386 --> 33:53.852
- Okay.
- Or diaper factory.

33:53.854 --> 33:55.055
Either one works.

33:55.058 --> 33:56.922
Did he just say "diaper factory"?

33:56.924 --> 33:58.223
Mm-hmm.

34:06.867 --> 34:08.266
Tracking that torpedo

34:08.268 --> 34:09.902
through the pipe's water sensor.

34:09.904 --> 34:11.179
11 minutes till it passes

34:11.183 --> 34:13.132
right through here. You
might want to boogie!

34:25.451 --> 34:27.150
Mac, now would be a really good time

34:27.154 --> 34:28.686
to unpack this plan of yours.

34:28.688 --> 34:30.355
How will this stop a torpedo?

34:30.357 --> 34:31.523
The chemical we got

34:31.525 --> 34:33.891
at the concrete plant
is sodium polyacrylate.

34:33.893 --> 34:36.396
It's a polymer used
to strengthen concrete.

34:40.234 --> 34:43.569
Same stuff used in baby diapers.

34:43.571 --> 34:44.938
Super absorbent.

34:48.141 --> 34:49.308
This valve

34:49.310 --> 34:52.399
opens up into the contact basin, where

34:52.402 --> 34:55.047
water passes through
before going into...

34:55.049 --> 34:57.483
homes and businesses.

34:59.353 --> 35:00.452
Did it stop?

35:00.454 --> 35:03.022
Okay, now start pouring everything in.

35:06.393 --> 35:08.827
Okay, now that should absorb the water,

35:08.829 --> 35:11.492
creating a gel firm enough

35:11.495 --> 35:14.600
to absorb the impact of
the torpedo, but soft enough

35:14.602 --> 35:16.516
that it won't explode

35:16.519 --> 35:19.070
on impact... theoretically.

35:28.449 --> 35:30.249
It's not working.

35:30.251 --> 35:31.637
The gel's not forming.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.024
Well, then, we'll shovel faster.

35:33.027 --> 35:34.987
No, no, that's not it. The
powder... it's clumping,

35:34.989 --> 35:36.755
so the chemical reaction
can't take place,

35:36.757 --> 35:39.024
and the shovels won't
reach. We need to mix it.

35:41.362 --> 35:43.442
Mac, what are you doing?

35:53.223 --> 35:54.383
Guys, it's working.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.541
The gel's forming.

35:59.813 --> 36:01.692
Five minutes to impact.

36:01.695 --> 36:03.481
Mac, get out of there, or the thing

36:03.484 --> 36:05.416
stopping that torpedo is gonna be you.

36:05.419 --> 36:06.752
I'm trying.

36:06.754 --> 36:08.223
This stuff is

36:08.226 --> 36:09.821
drying around me.

36:09.823 --> 36:11.156
It's like quicksand.

36:11.158 --> 36:12.190
You got to hurry up, Mac.

36:12.192 --> 36:13.582
I-I can't.

36:13.585 --> 36:14.590
It's no use. I'm working

36:14.593 --> 36:17.501
against thousands of pounds
of pressure down here.

36:17.504 --> 36:19.197
You've got to find another
way to get him out of there.

36:19.199 --> 36:20.266
Come on, Desi.

36:23.637 --> 36:24.970
Come on, Mac!

36:24.973 --> 36:26.358
The gel should work, but you should

36:26.360 --> 36:28.520
get to a safe distance
just in case, okay?

36:28.523 --> 36:30.942
- I'm not leaving you!
- Riley, you need to leave.

36:30.945 --> 36:32.445
Now.

36:36.297 --> 36:38.164
Guys, we're running out of time.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.832
What are we doing about Mac?

36:39.834 --> 36:41.334
Desi?

36:41.336 --> 36:42.835
Taylor?

36:42.837 --> 36:44.337
Where are they?

36:51.646 --> 36:53.045
Russ?

36:53.047 --> 36:55.983
Careful. You almost look impressed.

37:07.618 --> 37:09.419
We need more lift!

37:16.337 --> 37:17.671
More power?

37:21.042 --> 37:22.273
I can't hold on!

37:24.212 --> 37:26.445
Russ, lower the chopper.

37:28.016 --> 37:29.849
30 seconds till impact!

37:29.851 --> 37:31.884
Riley, hand me your backpack.

37:31.886 --> 37:34.354
I need to make a harness.

37:35.188 --> 37:36.788
All right, Desi, when I tug

37:36.791 --> 37:38.968
on the rope, pull up fast.

37:42.577 --> 37:44.196
What the hell is he doing?

37:48.627 --> 37:49.969
Ten seconds till impact!

37:49.971 --> 37:52.305
Nine, eight,

37:52.307 --> 37:54.106
seven...

37:55.143 --> 37:56.944
Now!

38:20.468 --> 38:22.402
Hey, guys, we got him.

38:22.405 --> 38:23.652
He's okay.

38:23.655 --> 38:25.237
Oh.

38:45.219 --> 38:47.625
Yes, I know, I know. I was

38:47.628 --> 38:50.096
rather fabulous.

38:50.098 --> 38:51.797
Russ.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.462
Well done.

38:56.303 --> 38:57.836
You saved the city.

38:57.839 --> 39:00.296
Ooh, what is this, uh...

39:00.299 --> 39:03.375
this warm, magical euphoria I'm feeling?

39:03.378 --> 39:04.610
Is this what, uh...

39:04.612 --> 39:06.679
is this what doing good
feels like, hmm? Hmm.

39:06.681 --> 39:10.349
So, what now, guys?

39:10.351 --> 39:14.324
Well, I... have papers to grade, so...

39:14.327 --> 39:15.888
Back to the real world, I guess?

39:15.890 --> 39:17.457
The real... Hang on. The real world?

39:17.459 --> 39:19.274
The real world is what we need to save.

39:19.277 --> 39:21.152
Have you forgotten the
whole global conspiracy?

39:21.155 --> 39:22.895
The-the "burn it all down"?

39:22.897 --> 39:24.797
Bishop said there were others.

39:24.799 --> 39:26.098
And they will not stop.

39:26.101 --> 39:27.832
What do you want us to do?

39:27.835 --> 39:29.309
We don't have the Phoenix anymore.

39:29.312 --> 39:31.737
Yes. About that.

39:31.739 --> 39:34.403
Um, there may be one other thing

39:34.406 --> 39:36.540
that I forgot to mention.

39:42.316 --> 39:44.583
Well, it's pretty much as you left it.

39:44.585 --> 39:48.301
Um, oh, some technical upgrades.

39:48.304 --> 39:51.290
Had a cleaning crew come in here.

39:51.292 --> 39:55.111
Oh, I'm working on putting
a foosball table over there.

39:55.114 --> 39:57.981
You bought the Phoenix?

39:57.984 --> 40:00.418
Yes. Few months ago. What?

40:00.421 --> 40:03.069
You didn't think I recruited
you all for just one mission?

40:03.071 --> 40:06.317
I had to, uh, you know,
kick the tires, as they say.

40:10.678 --> 40:13.045
So, you were testing us?

40:13.047 --> 40:14.647
Well, not just you. Me.

40:14.649 --> 40:17.716
I had to prove that, you know,
we could all work together.

40:17.718 --> 40:19.285
How would this even work?

40:19.287 --> 40:20.453
The same as before.

40:20.455 --> 40:22.755
Only this time, you'll
be privately funded,

40:22.757 --> 40:24.469
and, uh, after I pull

40:24.472 --> 40:27.626
a few strings: government sanctioned.

40:27.628 --> 40:29.628
Then we'll be able to pursue missions

40:29.631 --> 40:32.540
of my choosing.

40:32.543 --> 40:34.410
Our... your choosing?

40:37.204 --> 40:38.763
So...

40:38.766 --> 40:40.407
what do you say?

40:43.702 --> 40:45.710
Are you guys serious? Yes.

40:45.713 --> 40:47.099
It's a "yes."

40:47.102 --> 40:48.981
Hell, yeah.

40:48.983 --> 40:50.316
What can I say?

40:50.318 --> 40:52.234
I'm in. Saving the world is

40:52.237 --> 40:54.420
a lot more fun than
pretending to save the world.

40:54.422 --> 40:55.621
But I'm keeping my agent.

40:55.623 --> 40:56.953
Your asses

40:56.956 --> 41:00.258
would be toast without
me, so, I'll be here.

41:02.323 --> 41:03.890
Mac?

41:08.636 --> 41:10.637
This is home.
