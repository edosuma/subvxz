39:12.751 --> 39:21.593
**

39:21.627 --> 39:26.832
Dr. Murphy...

39:26.865 --> 39:30.001
I want to be the first
to welcome you

39:30.035 --> 39:33.405
to San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

39:33.439 --> 39:36.074
**

39:36.107 --> 39:38.477
We're very proud to have you.

39:38.510 --> 39:42.147
[ Applause ]

39:42.180 --> 39:48.186
**

39:48.219 --> 39:53.759
Shaun, Dr. Melendez's
team is going into surgery.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.628
I mean,
if you're interested.

40:01.467 --> 40:10.809
**

40:10.842 --> 40:20.151
**

40:20.185 --> 40:29.695
**

40:29.728 --> 40:39.070
**

40:39.104 --> 40:48.647
**

40:48.680 --> 40:57.989
**

40:58.023 --> 41:01.092
Got a messy
field here.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.529
Murphy.

41:03.562 --> 41:10.902
**

41:10.936 --> 41:13.639
Shaun: Suction.

41:13.672 --> 41:19.110
**

41:19.144 --> 41:22.047
Never forget,
you're the smart one.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.182
You can do anything.

41:24.215 --> 41:27.586
And I'm proud
of you, Shaun.

41:27.619 --> 41:33.525
**

41:33.559 --> 41:35.561
Bet you've seen
many of these.

41:38.129 --> 41:40.699
I remember my first.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.970
Kept thinking, "It doesn't get
any better than this."

41:45.003 --> 41:48.574
And for you, I'm afraid,
that's literally true.

41:50.809 --> 41:54.580
You're a nice kid,
and you're obviously very smart,

41:54.613 --> 41:57.683
but you don't belong here.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.651
So, as long as you're
part of my team,

41:59.685 --> 42:03.922
this is all you're ever
going to be doing -- suction.

42:07.726 --> 42:12.197
I saw a lot of surgeons
in medical school.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.199
You're much better
than them.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.768
I have a lot
to learn from you.

42:16.802 --> 42:23.041
**

42:23.074 --> 42:26.244
You're very arrogant.

42:26.277 --> 42:30.281
Do you think that helps you
be a good surgeon?

42:30.315 --> 42:34.219
Does it hurt you
as a person?

42:34.252 --> 42:36.922
Is it worth it?

42:36.955 --> 42:43.128
**

42:47.999 --> 42:57.308
**

42:57.342 --> 43:06.918
**

43:06.952 --> 43:16.294
**
