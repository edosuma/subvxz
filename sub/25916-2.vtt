00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
[theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.428
[man] <i>Hey!</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:26.651
Bean! No!

00:26.735 --> 00:28.528
She forgot her glove!

00:28.611 --> 00:30.864
My poor Princess Tiabeanie.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.283
She never had a chance
to say she loved me.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.534
[footsteps approaching]

00:34.617 --> 00:35.744
Now what? Whoa!

00:36.453 --> 00:37.495
[sniffs]

00:37.579 --> 00:39.664
Me smell fear.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.416
[stutters] I mean, I smell fear.

00:41.499 --> 00:45.295
You don't scare me!
I was born scared. Get him, men!

00:45.962 --> 00:47.422
[swords clinking]

00:47.505 --> 00:48.590
[grunting]

00:49.174 --> 00:51.384
[all grunting]

00:55.555 --> 00:57.766
-[monk] Boys, boys, boys.
-[knight] What?

00:57.849 --> 01:00.185
There's no conflict here.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.313
This is a plateau of peace.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.397
[throat singing]

01:12.030 --> 01:13.948
-Ah!
-[all grunting]

01:17.243 --> 01:21.748
I can get married or I can die.
This should be a harder decision.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.708
Hey! Death is the easy way out!

01:23.792 --> 01:26.795
So I say do it.
Do it! Do it, do it, do it!

01:26.878 --> 01:29.756
No! Your cruddy life
is worth living, Bean.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.383
And so is mine, if you live.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.719
Ugh. Geez. Do it.

01:34.803 --> 01:35.804
Hey, guys?

01:35.887 --> 01:36.721
[both] Yeah?

01:36.805 --> 01:38.807
Uh, while you were talking,
the stick broke.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.141
[Elfo and Bean screaming]

01:43.228 --> 01:46.564
Leaving when the ogre looked away
was an excellent strategy.

01:46.648 --> 01:50.902
Now, by my reckoning,
the bodies should have landed right here.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.237
Whoa!

01:54.364 --> 01:57.992
Dear God, you've mangled
my exquisite face!

01:58.076 --> 02:00.078
Wait, no, that's your face.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.246
What's wrong with my face?

02:01.329 --> 02:04.791
It looks like a foot.
I mean, if you're happy with it...

02:04.874 --> 02:05.875
Whoa!

02:22.684 --> 02:24.185
And that's when I discovered

02:24.269 --> 02:27.105
that the dragon could shoot fire
from both ends.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.607
Anyway, enough about
every detail of my life.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.234
Tell me something about you.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.152
[grunts]

02:32.235 --> 02:34.863
[man] Really? Fascinating. Exquisite.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.949
[playing fanfare]

02:38.032 --> 02:39.284
[distorted trumpet sound]

02:40.577 --> 02:44.873
Your Majesty, it is with much heroism
that I now return Princess Bean,

02:44.956 --> 02:47.584
along with this priceless sack of elf.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.835
Ah! Uh.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.838
This cold floor feels good
on my concussion.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.381
Hi, I'm Elfo!

02:53.464 --> 02:56.968
But more importantly,
I am the one and only Luci.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.220
Who cares what a cat has to say?

02:59.304 --> 03:00.388
[grunts]

03:00.471 --> 03:01.431
I'm not a cat!

03:01.514 --> 03:03.641
Ah, whatever. I'm gonna go lay down
in the window.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.895
All I care about
is this sweet, precious elf.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.271
Cram him in a cage!

03:08.938 --> 03:12.192
Dad, you can't just cage him.
Elves are jolly by nature.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.402
They need to prance and dance.

03:14.485 --> 03:17.155
Lucky for you, I'm a patron of the arts.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.205
But all frolicking stays
within castle walls.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.123
Well, get to it!

03:28.625 --> 03:30.710
[playing happy tune on flute]

03:33.254 --> 03:34.255
[screaming and grunting]

03:44.557 --> 03:47.268
It's still rolling,
but he has stopped screaming.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.688
Someone jab him with a sword,
make sure he's okay.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.816
Speaking of things getting poked,
we've got a wedding to plan.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.654
Ew. Dad, think out the words
before they come out. It's--

03:57.737 --> 03:59.948
I know. It felt weird when I said it.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.991
-[bells ringing]
-[seagulls squawking]

04:05.912 --> 04:10.250
We'll scrub you right up,
as clean as a child on his funeral day.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.251
Arms up!

04:11.751 --> 04:16.089
Oh. How my Charlie sparkled this morning
when they heaved him into the burial pit.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.674
He's in a better place now.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.802
Oh, yes, down there
with all his little friends.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.387
Ah. Not so hard!

04:22.470 --> 04:23.888
I'm sorry, Bunty.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.849
I don't mean to be insensitive
about your dead whatever.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.102
I just really don't want to marry
this wealthy prince.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.186
You understand.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.480
But it is your duty as a princess.

04:32.563 --> 04:35.566
We need this marriage
to cement our alliance with Bentwood.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.819
For our kingdom is rich in tradition,

04:37.902 --> 04:41.155
but their kingdom is rich in...
Well, riches.

04:41.239 --> 04:45.243
Plus, I don't see anyone else
storming your castle, princess.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.287
Rawr.

04:50.748 --> 04:51.749
[bubbling]

04:56.879 --> 04:57.964
[munches]

04:58.047 --> 04:59.716
-Your Highness.
-Eh?

04:59.799 --> 05:03.219
The elf may have value
far beyond what we expected.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.137
Uh...

05:04.220 --> 05:08.016
It appears there may be truth
to the old legends regarding the elves.

05:08.099 --> 05:13.438
It seems certain secrets were set down
in the ancient writings of Mephismo.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.355
[blows]

05:14.439 --> 05:15.898
[both coughing]

05:15.982 --> 05:17.942
I should dust in here more often.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.569
Anyway, I've read it before.

05:19.652 --> 05:24.490
The essence is that there is
enormously potent magic in elves' blood.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.412
Could this elf's blood be the key
to my wildest dream?

05:29.495 --> 05:34.083
Might we finally create
the Elixir of Life?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.252
I don't want to raise your hopes.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.755
But yes, definitely.

05:38.838 --> 05:39.839
[humming]

05:44.761 --> 05:47.180
Hey, Elfo, what are you lookin' at?

05:49.015 --> 05:53.144
I was just admiring the towel.
My people don't have terrycloth.

05:53.227 --> 05:56.856
I cannot marry that pig Merkimer.
[stutters] I can't do it.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.233
I'm gonna have to kill him or something.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.902
Do it. Do it, do it, do it!

06:00.985 --> 06:02.987
And after you kill him
we can hide the body.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.447
Then we could join the search party

06:04.530 --> 06:06.741
and you and I can look at each other
and try not to laugh.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.871
No! You're not a murderer, Bean!
Well, I mean, you did kill that one guy.

06:11.954 --> 06:16.000
Nope. Still alive, but suffering greatly.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.835
You're a sweet person.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.422
Sure, you're a violent alcoholic,
but you're not a killer.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.509
You're right. I'll go have a few drinks
and we'll figure something out.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.137
Oh.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.181
Hey, I'm still naked.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.100
I'm naked all the time.
You just didn't know it.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.726
And now you're never gonna un-know it.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.856
Uh, might we borrow
this little man for a moment?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.650
I just need to pick his brain.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.277
Through his nostrils.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.947
So, how we gonna kill your fiancÃ©?

06:46.030 --> 06:48.616
Candlestick in the conservatory?
Candlestick in the face?

06:48.699 --> 06:50.993
I think we need to be
a little bit more discreet. Oh. Poison could be perfect!

06:56.082 --> 06:58.501
This one causes slow, painful death.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.879
This one kills you with kindness
and some belladonna.

07:01.963 --> 07:05.466
And this one's so poisonous you can't
even hold it in a bottle. [chuckles]

07:05.550 --> 07:06.884
Oh. Excuse me.

07:07.885 --> 07:08.719
[thuds]

07:10.888 --> 07:12.181
Have you folks been helped?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.516
We're still browsing.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.561
Uh, you know what?
I'm just not comfortable with murder.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.688
There's got to be another way
to get rid of him.

07:18.771 --> 07:19.856
You could just marry him

07:19.939 --> 07:21.691
and drive him mad
with your indecisiveness.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.608
Hmm.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.776
I don't know.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.867
We're running out of time. [stutters]

07:30.950 --> 07:34.120
What if I rub a sick chicken
all over his face and hope for the best?

07:34.203 --> 07:35.204
[clucks then coughs]

07:35.288 --> 07:36.497
[bells ringing]

07:39.792 --> 07:40.918
[Bean] Mermaids!

07:41.627 --> 07:43.546
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

07:43.629 --> 07:44.714
[muffled] Probably not.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.424
[chicken clucks then wheezes]

07:48.176 --> 07:51.804
[chuckles] Something tickles.
Is there a mosquito on my leg?

07:51.888 --> 07:56.017
Behold, sire,
as I extract a small quantity of blood.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.436
I only have a small quantity of blood.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.947
Excellent. I've asked
the eminent Lord Lingonberry

08:10.031 --> 08:11.657
to take part in the experiment.

08:11.741 --> 08:16.245
And may I say what a deep honor
it is to assist His Majesty in this most--

08:16.329 --> 08:17.288
Strap him down!

08:17.872 --> 08:21.292
This is the first interesting thing
that's ever happened to me.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.462
To test the revitalizing influence
of the blood,

08:24.545 --> 08:27.131
I shall apply a small measure to the scalp

08:27.215 --> 08:30.468
to regrow his Lordship's once-lavish hair.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.095
And... doink.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.267
Nothing's happening.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.020
But, ho!
Some hair has sprouted in his ear.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.231
His ears were always like that!

08:43.314 --> 08:45.608
It's like he keeps paintbrushes in there.

08:45.691 --> 08:49.487
Yes, well, I suppose
the life-giving magic may take a while.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.323
Uh, come back in a few days,
Lord Lingonberry.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.368
He's dead.

08:55.451 --> 08:59.205
Pity. He was a good man. A family man.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.668
[pigs squealing]

09:04.669 --> 09:07.380
Clearly, the volume of blood
was inadequate.

09:07.463 --> 09:11.801
To extract greater quantities,
we'll need more sophisticated methods.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.594
Mop Girl, milk him.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.597
[squirting]

09:16.681 --> 09:19.433
My brain feels dry.

09:24.355 --> 09:28.651
Now we hope Merkimer's a big enough idiot
to fall for this mermaid plan.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.278
I'm feeling optimistic.

09:30.861 --> 09:36.951
[chuckling nervously] So, Merkimer, I know
I've been a little cold and distant,

09:37.034 --> 09:39.495
and some would say
overflowing with revulsion--

09:39.579 --> 09:41.622
That's okay. I don't listen to women.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.374
But before we marry

09:43.457 --> 09:46.210
and I enter a state
of semi-permanent pregnancy...

09:46.294 --> 09:48.462
[chuckles nervously] Woo!

09:48.546 --> 09:51.340
I just wanted to make sure
you have some fun.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.595
That's why I insist
you have a bachelor party.

09:55.678 --> 10:01.392
It'll be way out on the open seas
where the only law is the law of no laws.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.978
Anything goes.

10:04.687 --> 10:08.024
Anything... goes.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.945
Anything goes!

10:13.029 --> 10:13.863
Whoa!

10:13.946 --> 10:15.448
They call it a party barge,

10:15.531 --> 10:19.118
and it's charting a course
for Mermaid Island.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.995
This island has real mermaids?

10:21.078 --> 10:23.497
It's not just named after
Gerald K. Mermaid?

10:23.581 --> 10:26.834
It was named after him,
but it also has mermaids.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.629
Intriguing. But don't mermaids
use their mesmo-songs

10:29.712 --> 10:31.339
to lure men to their deaths?

10:31.422 --> 10:34.133
Ah, only weak-minded men fall for that.

10:34.216 --> 10:36.093
So you'll be pretty much fine.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.721
Very well. I'm in.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.681
What a gullible idiot.

10:40.765 --> 10:41.974
Can I go, too?

10:44.852 --> 10:48.481
Our first experiment
with the elf blood was inconclusive.

10:48.564 --> 10:52.652
But these new tests shall reveal
its restorative powers.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.409
Hmm.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.579
Fly!

11:06.040 --> 11:06.874
Oh. [gulps]

11:13.005 --> 11:13.839
[Elfo] Ow!

11:20.471 --> 11:22.139
[gasps] Are you okay?

11:22.223 --> 11:24.642
[weakly] If I say no,
will I seem less manly?

11:24.725 --> 11:26.811
Elfo, that's not possible.

11:27.395 --> 11:31.023
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size? Like a barn!

11:31.107 --> 11:33.484
First of all, sweetie, shut up.

11:33.567 --> 11:37.655
I'm not gonna hurt this little guy.
I'm gonna leech the magic out of him.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.865
Don't you want a magic daddy?

11:39.949 --> 11:42.868
No! Gosh. I don't want a magic daddy,

11:42.952 --> 11:45.413
and I would never call you that
even if you were!

11:45.496 --> 11:50.584
You just want your stupid Elixir of Life
so you can be immortal and rule forever.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.586
God, you're selfish and cruel.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.631
Selfish? Maybe. But cruel?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.049
Ah, also maybe.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.219
Sire, harnessing the blood's power
has proven difficult.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.471
Perhaps if I had more to work with...

12:02.555 --> 12:06.308
[groans] Look at this!
There's more blood in my chamber pot.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.603
If this flask isn't filled
with elf blood by morning,

12:09.687 --> 12:12.857
we'll grind him to a paste
and see if that works better.

12:13.691 --> 12:17.445
Oh! If that paste doesn't work,
I'm in real trouble.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.696
[owl hoots]

12:19.155 --> 12:19.989
[bell dings]

12:23.993 --> 12:27.788
I'm an optimist.
I say the flask is half-full.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.790
-It's not.
-Don't be so negative.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.293
-Where there's a will, there's a way.
-There's not.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.335
[pigs squeal, grunt]

12:42.470 --> 12:46.849
Shut your snouts, you dumb pigs,
or I'm gonna... Oh, wait.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.738
Did you know that pigs are 80% blood?

13:00.821 --> 13:03.240
-Really?
-Not anymore.

13:08.746 --> 13:13.834
I must admit, the quantity of blood
exceeded my expectations.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.213
So Elfo is free to go?

13:17.296 --> 13:18.255
Hmm.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.423
For now.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.134
Looks like I picked the wrong day
to wear sandals.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.765
[whooping]

13:27.848 --> 13:30.184
Was I the only one hoping for more blood?

13:30.267 --> 13:32.144
I feel weak and queasy.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.523
What you need is a nice, long boat ride.

13:45.658 --> 13:50.704
All aboard the party barge!
I hope you like fun and soggy pretzels.

13:50.788 --> 13:51.747
[men cheering]

13:53.332 --> 13:55.960
I hope you like me yelling!

13:56.043 --> 13:57.795
Stop right there, Your Ladyness.

13:57.878 --> 14:01.090
A delicate flower like yourself
has no place aboard--

14:01.173 --> 14:02.174
[grunts]

14:02.258 --> 14:03.425
Good point.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
I'm so glad you're coming along, Bean.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.140
You'll get to know the crazy, fun me,

14:10.224 --> 14:13.686
before spending the rest of your life
with the boring, bossy me.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.771
I'm lucky in so many ways.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.442
[captain] Now listen up, you landhuggers.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.152
This may be a party barge,

14:22.236 --> 14:25.281
but the dangers of Mermaid Island
be all too real.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.449
So drink responsibly!

14:33.247 --> 14:34.081
[coughs]

14:34.915 --> 14:35.916
[screams]

14:38.127 --> 14:42.381
-[all chant] Spin the elf! Spin the elf!
-Spin the-- [screams]

14:42.464 --> 14:45.009
Attention on the party barge!

14:45.092 --> 14:48.178
We be sailing now into treacherous waters.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.015
To starboard, man-eating sharks.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.684
To port, a sunset so beautiful

14:53.767 --> 14:56.312
the rest of your life
will seem anticlimactic.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.272
But the worst lies ahead!

14:58.355 --> 15:03.068
For there lurk the twin shores
of Mermaid Island and Walrus Island.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.447
And you don't want to mix those up,
believe me.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.949
Let's get this underway, shall we?

15:09.033 --> 15:12.494
Everyone line up single file
to get lashed to the masts.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.580
God forbid you lose control
and jump overboard.

15:14.663 --> 15:15.497
We don't want that.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.924
Anyone not tied down
better plug your ears.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.177
"Ear wax"? Does it mean it's for ears
or from ears?

15:28.260 --> 15:31.722
Arr, you'll want to put the wax in
before you hear me answer.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.647
Tighter, man, tighter!
I have poor impulse control.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.609
You remembered to use a slipknot, right?

15:43.692 --> 15:47.363
I can't hear you! I've got wax in my ears!

15:47.446 --> 15:51.116
You rigged it so he'll break free
and leap overboard, right?

15:51.200 --> 15:52.117
The plan?

15:52.201 --> 15:54.203
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.164
Well, no. I couldn't do it.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.082
Ugh.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.751
Elf defense? Try self-defense.

16:00.834 --> 16:01.919
Just go cut the ropes.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.505
-Stop! No! Don't do it!
-Do it. Do it. -I can't jump that high.
-Do it! Elfo...

16:07.174 --> 16:09.176
-That's not fair.
-Don't listen to Elfo. You're playing to your strengths,
and not mine.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.892
[laughs mockingly] See?
Even the gods don't want you to do it.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.020
Then they shouldn't have given me
these big bad buck teeth.

16:21.772 --> 16:26.402
My prince, may I give you one last kiss
for good luck?

16:26.485 --> 16:28.904
On the forearm, for whatever reason?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.699
That's kind of Mother's thing, but sure.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.741
[kisses]

16:33.993 --> 16:34.827
[biting] Did it work?

16:39.331 --> 16:44.378
All hands, brace fer mermaids!
And their irresistible song.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.715
If it's smooth jazz,
I will destroy this place.

16:47.798 --> 16:48.799
[harmonious singing]

16:55.389 --> 16:56.974
[all sighing]

16:57.057 --> 16:59.435
-Oh.
-Oh.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.397
It's beautiful. Such angelic voices.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.775
I've never heard a song
so sweet and delicate.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.278
I must have sex with its origin.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.040
Ha! I'm free! Lead the way, loins.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.750
[grunts]

17:23.333 --> 17:24.501
[men gasp]

17:29.048 --> 17:33.594
I'm Merkimer. I can't wait to meet you.
I don't need your names, though.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.685
Ladies, the legends do not do you justice.

17:41.769 --> 17:46.148
Not one mention of your fuzzy muzzles.
Climb aboard.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.524
[walruses singing]

17:48.358 --> 17:49.193
[Merkimer] Ooh!

17:49.860 --> 17:51.528
Yes!

17:51.612 --> 17:54.198
Uh... Should we be doing something?

17:54.281 --> 17:56.825
I'm already smoking and laughing.
What more do you want?

17:58.077 --> 17:58.994
[laughs]

18:00.537 --> 18:01.830
-[singing stops]
-[Merkimer] Whoa!

18:01.914 --> 18:03.791
Listen. They've stopped singing.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.420
Aye, their siren song is done for now.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.882
And we only lost one man.
That's actually not bad.

18:11.965 --> 18:15.969
Usually everyone dies.
I don't advertise that fact. [chuckles]

18:16.053 --> 18:20.015
[Mertz] Merkimer may be gone,
but at least he prepaid for the barge.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.476
-To Merkimer!
-[all] To Merkimer!

18:26.188 --> 18:30.109
As Merkimer's fiancÃ©e,
I'd like to say a few words.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.486
Let's head back.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.032
Where the hell are we?
This fog is as thick as chowder.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.494
Chowder? It doesn't always
have to be nautical references with me.

18:40.577 --> 18:45.124
There are plenty of other thick soups.
Cream of potato, that's one.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.418
Uh... Chili... I guess that's not a soup.

18:48.502 --> 18:52.131
Uh... Ham chowder.
No, that's a chowder. Uh...

18:52.214 --> 18:53.715
What's the one with the salt?

18:53.799 --> 18:57.845
[stutters] Salt soup!
There you are. Salt soup.

18:57.928 --> 18:58.762
Bah!

18:58.846 --> 19:01.640
Look, in the distance!
The lights of the kingdom!

19:05.978 --> 19:07.062
That's no land.

19:07.146 --> 19:11.066
It's a ship of war,
flying the dread flag of the Borcs!

19:11.150 --> 19:15.237
[gasps] They must be planning
a sneak attack on Dreamland!

19:15.320 --> 19:17.447
Don't panic. We can slip away unnoticed

19:17.531 --> 19:20.993
as long as everyone remains
absolutely silent.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.077
[loudly] What?

19:25.372 --> 19:26.206
[grunting]

19:29.168 --> 19:32.963
They've spotted us. Defend the barge
or risk losing your deposit.

19:33.046 --> 19:33.881
[gasps]

19:33.964 --> 19:35.299
Fire the cannon!

19:38.594 --> 19:40.721
Don't look at that. You didn't pay for it.

19:40.804 --> 19:41.638
[growling]

19:48.687 --> 19:51.690
I'm sorry, guys.
We're gonna die and it's all my fault.

19:51.773 --> 19:55.068
No, it was me with my incessant
do it, do it, do it, do its.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.445
That's what made you do it.

19:56.528 --> 20:00.824
Neither one of you was to blame.
It was both of you. You both killed us.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.075
[screaming]

20:02.159 --> 20:04.369
The barge is falling apart!

20:04.453 --> 20:07.664
Aye, 'twas held together mainly by stains.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.421
[grunting]

20:17.758 --> 20:21.637
All the confetti cannons in the world
couldn't save us now.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.348
[walruses singing]

20:26.350 --> 20:28.143
Mermaids, attack!

20:32.689 --> 20:34.274
[grunting and yelling]

20:54.461 --> 20:57.589
Didn't you always want a husband
that screwed 30 walruses?

20:57.673 --> 20:59.091
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.133
[water splashes]

21:07.766 --> 21:10.352
King Zog, you're giving me your daughter,

21:10.435 --> 21:13.814
so it's only fair I give you
something of equal value.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.275
The head of the Borc admiral!

21:17.025 --> 21:22.406
That's not a Borc, it's a Bozak!
They're our closest allies!

21:22.489 --> 21:24.950
The Bozak wedding delegation
never arrived.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.661
No wonder all those presents
have been washing ashore.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.835
Then let this be a warning
to your other allies.

21:45.220 --> 21:48.181
This is the dress my mom wore
when she married my dad.

21:48.765 --> 21:52.269
I thought when it was my turn to wear it,
I'd be as happy as she was.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.355
Somehow, I don't think
my portrait's gonna be nearly as happy.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.858
If you no like, I fix.

21:57.941 --> 22:01.486
No, no, that's okay, Giuseppe.
We hired you for your emotional realism.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.404
[bells tolling]

22:04.656 --> 22:05.907
It's time.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.952
Well, free will was fun while it lasted.

22:09.036 --> 22:12.748
Just doing the stuff I wanted to do,
going places I wanted to go.

22:12.831 --> 22:16.001
That time I stole a baby walrus.
You guys were there.

22:16.084 --> 22:19.880
So, anyway, here comes the bride.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.137
[sighs]

22:28.847 --> 22:32.100
I can't bear to watch. I'll be in my cage.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.156
[bells ringing]

22:53.121 --> 22:54.623
Anyone seen Sorcerio?

22:54.706 --> 22:57.959
Ugh. No, he's at a wedding. Your wedding.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.546
Well, if it isn't my
little barge buddy, Elmo.

23:01.630 --> 23:06.510
Ugh, I told you, my name is Elfo.
Elmo was my house. I lived in an elm.

23:06.593 --> 23:09.137
I'm feeling a tad nervous, my tiny friend.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.516
Those mermaids worked me over
pretty hard, sexually.

23:12.599 --> 23:16.103
I may not be able to perform tonight
on the marital mattress.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.563
[grunts] Stop talking to me.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.440
I mean, I'm drained.

23:20.524 --> 23:24.069
Haha! Here it is.
Legend has it that elf blood contains

23:24.152 --> 23:25.946
the mystical essence of life itself.

23:26.029 --> 23:29.282
Perhaps it could perk up
my poor, tuckered dong.

23:29.366 --> 23:33.537
Please stop! There's no place like Elmo.
There's no place like Elmo...

23:33.620 --> 23:36.331
Mind if I have a little sip of you juice?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.917
Hold up. That's not elf's blood,
that's pig's--

23:39.000 --> 23:43.130
[stutters] Help yourself!
Do it. Do it. Do it!

23:47.467 --> 23:50.929
Enough rigmarole.
Bring in the blushing groom.

23:53.974 --> 23:54.808
[crowd gasping]

23:55.600 --> 23:58.061
I've never felt such vigor.

23:58.145 --> 24:01.565
You're all invited to our marital evening.
[laughs]

24:02.149 --> 24:05.527
Hmm. Feeling a bit... [retches]
What's happening?

24:05.610 --> 24:06.570
[squeals]

24:09.281 --> 24:10.615
Well, this is odd.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.700
[squealing and grunting]

24:11.783 --> 24:13.034
[all gasp]

24:13.118 --> 24:14.119
[cackles]

24:18.081 --> 24:19.040
[crowd gasp]

24:19.124 --> 24:19.958
[grunts] [squeals]

24:24.129 --> 24:25.046
Hey.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.634
Really, Dad? [scoffs]
You're fine with this?

24:29.718 --> 24:32.345
You think this arranged marriage
will solve your problems?

24:32.429 --> 24:34.181
You think that magic will? [scoffs]

24:34.264 --> 24:37.184
You're just thinking about yourself,
what you want.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.852
You don't care about me.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.146
Isn't there a point in everyone's life

24:41.229 --> 24:44.524
where they need to, like,
go and figure out who they are?

24:44.608 --> 24:48.570
Are we standing in that moment right now?
Maybe.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.531
But I know one thing,
and I know it real good,

24:51.615 --> 24:53.700
I know it really, really intensely,

24:53.783 --> 24:57.120
and that's [stutters]
I don't want to marry this pig.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.456
[squeals]

24:59.956 --> 25:01.124
Or that one either.

25:01.208 --> 25:05.545
Ah, to hell with it.
Bean may be crazy, but she's right.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.881
This whole cursed wedding is canceled.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.007
[all gasp]

25:09.090 --> 25:10.425
And the bar is closed.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.718
[all gasp angrily]

25:11.801 --> 25:15.013
If you're calling off the wedding,
I'm calling off the alliance!

25:15.096 --> 25:20.101
Oh, yeah? My knuckles'll make an alliance
with your pig-fathering face!

25:20.185 --> 25:23.688
[crowd chanting] King fight!
King fight! King fight!

25:23.772 --> 25:25.524
-King fight! King fight!
-Come on.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.858
[crowd cheering]

25:28.068 --> 25:29.069
[grunts]

25:31.571 --> 25:35.033
Guys, thanks for making my wedding
a day I'll always remember.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.202
Now let's see how fast we can forget it.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.040
-To us.
-But mainly me!

25:43.166 --> 25:45.168
-[crowd clamoring]
-[Zog] And furthermore!

25:45.252 --> 25:47.087
[grunts] I compliment you
on that one, sir.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.638
[pig squealing]
