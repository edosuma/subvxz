00:14.600 --> 00:17.832
- The entire market is watching.
- Back with Dynacorps' CEO.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.753
You must be very happy with this news...

00:19.920 --> 00:21.912
This runaway hit
that is the Dynacorps IPO...

00:22.120 --> 00:23.554
Take a look at the evaluation,
I'm really doubtful...

00:23.720 --> 00:26.792
So a great day for Dynacorps
and for the bankers at Gemini Trust...

00:27.000 --> 00:28.559
You'll understand...

00:28.720 --> 00:31.394
...is climbing rapidly upwards today.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.199
...moving broadly higher at this hour...

00:33.360 --> 00:35.716
with utility and tech shares
leading the gains.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.997
But there is really
only one story out there...

00:38.160 --> 00:40.436
that everybody
in the market is watching...

00:40.640 --> 00:42.677
and that is the Dynacorps IPO.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.911
This truly is a historic day.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.514
We knew from the road show...

00:46.680 --> 00:48.990
the demand for the stock
was going to be strong.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.311
We expected to see a pop at the open.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.916
But nobody thought Dynacorps
would soar like this...

00:54.080 --> 00:56.993
all the way to 47,
and it looks like it is still climbing...

00:57.200 --> 00:59.556
at this hour, so a much better debut...

00:59.720 --> 01:03.236
than investors could have hoped for.
Of course, with this kind of move...

01:03.400 --> 01:06.120
you wonder whether the stock
may have been mispriced...

01:06.280 --> 01:09.239
whether or not perhaps they left
a little money on the table.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.710
We know that they actually
switched underwriters...

01:11.920 --> 01:14.435
going into this IPO, so there
was a bit of concern...

01:14.600 --> 01:18.276
about how things would shake
up, but clearly Dynacorps' IPO...

01:18.440 --> 01:20.830
is shaping up to be
one of the most successful...

01:21.000 --> 01:23.515
public offerings of the year.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.479
So what happened with Dynacorps?

01:34.640 --> 01:39.590
Neel, I have taken nine Silicon Valley
companies public in the last five years...

01:39.760 --> 01:43.276
and you want to talk about
the one I didn't take to the finish line?

01:44.680 --> 01:47.912
I work for the largest
investment bank in the world.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.992
We both know I found you guys capital...

01:50.160 --> 01:53.039
when you were just a couple kids
with a laptop and a dream.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.955
So we can talk about Dynacorps...

01:57.120 --> 01:59.430
or we can talk about you...

01:59.640 --> 02:01.677
and how I'm gonna grow your company...

02:01.840 --> 02:05.117
so you can build technology
that will transform people's lives.

02:09.479 --> 02:13.030
- Try the Tasmanian sea trout.
- Yeah, maybe I should.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.150
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.634
- Hi.
- Hi. I saw the e-mail from Neel.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.830
Mm. He does love to play hard to get.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.316
Everyone likes to think
their company's a unicorn.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.473
- You read up on the other companies?
- Yeah, so I was looking at...

04:38.640 --> 04:41.200
Cachet? I have a hunch
they're looking to expand.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.238
You've got the numbers on them?

04:45.440 --> 04:47.159
I will bring them right over.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.310
Great.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.909
Yeah?

04:55.040 --> 04:57.999
Everyone's saying there's gonna be
some movement around here.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.675
So I'm wondering
if now might be the time...

05:00.840 --> 05:02.672
- ...to talk about that promotion?
- No.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.513
Now is not the right time.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.797
HR is out there snatching BlackBerries.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.192
I get that. But I've been
under-compensated two years in a row...

05:11.360 --> 05:16.196
Erin, I told you I'd make a push
for you, and I will. But it is a down year.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.358
I do need those numbers ASAP.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.197
Naomi?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.430
Excuse me.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.438
Sam, hi.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.714
I... You know, I meant to reach out
when I heard you were doing this, but I...

06:07.880 --> 06:10.440
I thought you hated alumni events.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.233
Well...

06:12.400 --> 06:14.198
- But I think this is important.
- Yeah.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.955
I think these girls look at me
as what not to do.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.119
How to go to law school
and still end up broke.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.593
Well, I'm sure there must be
one young idealist in here somewhere.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.797
I hope so. Heh.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.440
So how are you? How are things?

06:28.600 --> 06:32.116
Are you still at the U.S. Attorney's Office
locking up drug dealers?

06:32.280 --> 06:36.035
I am. Uh, I'm actually in your area now.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.238
White-collar crime, uh, securities.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.958
Wow, that's quite a change.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.316
And you're at Remson still?

06:45.480 --> 06:46.880
I'm a lifer.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.193
Golden handcuffs.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.080
Yeah.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.518
You got a file on us?

06:55.440 --> 06:58.478
I imagine we have a file on everyone.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.840
You know, I was just thinking
the other night...

07:05.000 --> 07:09.279
about the evening of Goatee Guy.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.511
- No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.637
That was horrifying.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.110
- The most awful walk of shame.
- It was awesome.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.875
No, it's not awesome.
There's nothing awesome about it.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.119
Know what? We really should
get together. It's been forever.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.475
I would love that.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.994
- Me too.
- I'll, um...

07:26.160 --> 07:28.994
- I'll see you on the panel.
- Yeah. See you up there.

07:31.840 --> 07:36.471
I'm wondering, for each of you,
what's that thing that really makes you...

07:36.680 --> 07:38.273
want to get up in the morning?

07:43.320 --> 07:48.270
Well, for me, I guess,
the simplest answer is...

07:50.280 --> 07:51.839
I like money.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.677
I do. I like numbers.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.513
I like negotiating.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.637
I love a challenge.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.520
Turning a no into a yes.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.718
But I really do like money.

08:05.920 --> 08:09.152
I like knowing that I have it.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.358
I grew up in a house
where there was never enough.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.433
I was raised by a single mom
with four kids.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.199
I took my first job on Wall Street...

08:17.360 --> 08:20.910
so I could put my little brothers
through college.

08:21.080 --> 08:26.155
But I am not going to sit here
and tell you that I only do what I do...

08:26.320 --> 08:32.236
to take care of other people,
because it is okay to do it for ourselves.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.393
For how it makes us feel.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.756
Secure? Yeah.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.879
Powerful? Absolutely.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.879
I am so glad
that it's finally acceptable...

08:44.080 --> 08:48.677
for women to talk about ambition openly.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.874
But don't let money be a dirty word.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.157
We can like that too.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.880
Did I see you in a dress last night?

09:07.040 --> 09:08.269
Shut up.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.636
So you go to the thing? You talk to her?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.916
- Your friend?
- I did.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.393
And? She give you anything
on the hedge fund guy?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.392
I haven't seen the woman in eight years.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.597
What exactly do you think
she'll give me...

09:26.760 --> 09:28.638
at our appearance at an alumni event?

09:28.800 --> 09:32.476
Look, this was your idea to nail Benji
through your banker friend, not mine.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.552
I said I'd make contact.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.274
And?

09:36.440 --> 09:38.830
I made contact.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.950
Naomi, thanks for coming.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.239
You know Leslie from HR?

10:16.640 --> 10:19.997
She needs a couple more names
from your department.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.954
Teddy Sidel and Arthur Abbott.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.993
You do know who Teddy's uncle is?

10:29.160 --> 10:31.311
You asked me to identify
the weakest performers.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.672
What you do with that information
is up to you.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.155
Okay.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.999
I guess you've heard the talk.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.953
I'm getting out. Retiring.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.272
Congratulations, Randall.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.036
You never want to stay
at the party too long.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.158
Your turn.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.640
Steady now.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.760
So they'll be naming a new...

11:16.840 --> 11:18.957
global head.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.873
Look, Naomi, I'm gonna be frank with you.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.073
This doesn't look like your year.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.632
Because of Dynacorps?

11:34.800 --> 11:38.237
I did ask around
about what happened there.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.154
And the perception...

11:41.800 --> 11:44.190
is that you rubbed
some people the wrong way.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.755
They're looking for a rainmaker.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.680
Hm.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.878
You're hesitating. Push it.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.111
Go. Go!

12:09.280 --> 12:12.352
Go! Go! Go.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.995
I mean, at least hit me with some facts.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.594
Use my numbers against me.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.713
But perception? What the fuck
do I do with that?

12:25.800 --> 12:28.076
You haven't told me
the details about that deal.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.596
You didn't discuss it
at the board meeting?

12:31.360 --> 12:34.319
Apparently I wore an awful dress.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.720
- Oh, men don't do this, right?
- Hmm?

12:40.920 --> 12:44.277
You don't... You don't lose sleep over
this kind of stuff, do you?

12:44.440 --> 12:46.477
Oh, yeah, yeah, we do.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.313
We just don't...
We just don't turn in on ourselves.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.354
No, it's much more fun...

12:53.520 --> 12:56.877
- ...to get really pissed at someone else.
- Ooh.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.439
Yeah.

13:10.320 --> 13:14.394
What's the biggest deal
you could get right now?

13:15.200 --> 13:19.479
Cachet just added their 12th board member.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.994
Right.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.391
So they're going public?

13:24.360 --> 13:28.673
I found VCs for that kid
when he had five employees.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.200
Huh.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.280
What time's your car coming?

13:48.440 --> 13:50.079
Four-thirty.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.709
Oh, Jesus, babe.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.917
You need to sleep.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.118
Please don't tell me what I need.

13:58.280 --> 14:01.352
Okay. I get it.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.399
You have to win the bake sale.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.440
Bake off.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.633
Bring me a brownie.

14:10.200 --> 14:15.832
Hm. I am bringing home the fucking bakery.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.077
- Yes!
- Yes.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.709
That's right. Oh, where are you going?

14:20.920 --> 14:23.515
Heh. I'm going to bed.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.352
I hope I never have
to battle you for anything.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.796
Because you'd lose.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.839
Here's your coffees.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.033
- Thank you so much. I appreciate that.
- Thanks.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.677
- Hey, was that Channing Trust?
- Yeah, dude.

15:05.880 --> 15:09.032
My uncle said Remson's tapping the guy
with the glasses for new global head.

15:36.920 --> 15:40.152
When I was a kid, if you wanted privacy...

15:40.320 --> 15:43.472
if you wanted to send a secret message...

15:43.640 --> 15:46.838
you made invisible ink with vinegar.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.993
And when you were ready to go public...

15:50.160 --> 15:53.437
you revealed your secret message
with grape juice.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.320
Hm.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.119
But there's nothing secret...

16:07.320 --> 16:10.392
about what brings us all together today.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.598
I'd like to introduce you
to my VP Erin Manning.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.514
She'll go through
some specifics of our proposal.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.955
Cachet certainly has taken
privacy to the next level...

16:20.160 --> 16:22.391
and we are so pleased
to have had a chance...

16:22.560 --> 16:24.517
to foster that growth.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.672
If you open your pitch books
to page two...

16:26.880 --> 16:29.554
you'll see in the first model,
we're predicting a valuation...

16:29.720 --> 16:33.475
of a little over a billion,
at 34 to 36 a share.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.952
Well, you're certainly presenting us
with some compelling numbers.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.510
You guys can tell we've done our homework.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.876
But...

16:45.040 --> 16:48.078
that's not why you're gonna
give me this deal.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.194
Okay.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.120
I remember what you told me
the first day we met.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.880
You said, "We're not
a social media company...

16:57.040 --> 16:58.394
with privacy settings.

16:58.560 --> 17:02.793
We're a privacy company
that can build a social network.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.640
An impenetrable social network."

17:05.800 --> 17:08.269
I understood that.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.669
The need for it.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.190
I felt it in my gut.

17:12.359 --> 17:15.034
Now, some other people
thought you guys were paranoid.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.236
Right?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.278
Investors wouldn't go for it.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.396
Now fast forward.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.715
Edward Snowden.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.394
The Sony hack.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.876
Nude photos of actresses.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.598
Your revenue jumps.

17:27.760 --> 17:32.312
Your competitors start rolling out.
But we were ahead of the curve...

17:32.480 --> 17:36.235
because we understood
that it gets harder every day...

17:36.400 --> 17:37.993
to trust people in this world.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.709
And security is the hottest commodity.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.274
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.194
- Go, us.
- Well done. Heh, heh.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.750
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.318
No, no, no. Don't stand up.
I'm with a client.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.350
I just wanted to say, uh...

18:06.200 --> 18:08.032
congratulations.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.116
- Great work, all of you.
- Thank you.

18:11.280 --> 18:15.957
- Thank you. Randall, you know Erin?
- Of course.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.396
She did spectacular work on this one.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.074
Always good to hear.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.792
Again, congratulations.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.518
I recommend the New York Strip. Heh, heh.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.240
- New York Strip it is.
- Well...

18:45.040 --> 18:47.032
How far along are you?

18:49.160 --> 18:50.992
It's really early.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.833
Six weeks?

18:54.040 --> 18:55.315
Wow.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.235
Well, congratulations.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.714
Thanks.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.313
Okay, I'll see you in a minute.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.709
Oh, fuck.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.636
Mark your calendars.

19:29.800 --> 19:33.510
August 28th will be the IPO
for the privacy company Cachet.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.911
Seems like every time
there's a hacking scandal...

19:36.080 --> 19:38.197
Cachet's sales increase dramatically.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.631
Bloomberg News has learned
that Naomi Bishop...

19:40.800 --> 19:42.120
will be the lead banker on the deal.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.198
Some money managers surprised by this...

19:44.360 --> 19:48.991
after she ruffled some feathers
in an earlier IPO. Also in the new...

20:15.800 --> 20:17.439
Thank you.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.239
Step away from the BlackBerry.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.115
Ah!

20:29.960 --> 20:31.030
Jeez.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.953
Nicely done.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.955
You know what's weird
about the whole privacy thing?

20:39.120 --> 20:40.600
What?

20:41.960 --> 20:43.599
Half the world is paranoid...

20:43.800 --> 20:48.397
and the other half's password
is "password."

20:50.880 --> 20:52.678
That's true.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.918
What's your lamest password?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.390
I'm so not telling you my passwords.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.789
Oh, come on, old school.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.792
Like '96.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.394
- '96? I...
- Mm-hm.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.230
- "Bankerchick."
- Oh.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.995
- "Bankerchick," huh?
- Mm-hm.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.398
That's really kind of hot.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.116
- Is it?
- Mm.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.193
Hell, yeah, Bankerchick.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.715
Who the hell is that?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.798
I don't know.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.275
Oh, shit.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.557
It's Erin.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.159
VP Erin?

22:09.160 --> 22:10.389
Hi, Erin.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.119
Hi.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.158
Sorry.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.876
Thanks.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.838
Bye, Erin.

22:20.480 --> 22:21.914
Bye.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.952
Now...

22:34.480 --> 22:36.870
where were we?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.718
- This is Naomi.
- Hey, gorgeous.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.473
How are things up on the 11th floor?

23:06.640 --> 23:10.554
Mm. You still have the better view,
but it's a good day.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.712
- Pitch went well?
- Turn on Bloomberg.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.280
Then let's celebrate.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.920
Okay, later.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.113
Later? What about
that empty office up on 18?

23:19.280 --> 23:20.839
- Michael.
- What are you wearing?

23:21.040 --> 23:23.350
Heh, heh. Michael, we cannot.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.671
Hey, Compliance, are you listening?

23:25.880 --> 23:28.839
The only wall we're crossing here
is the wall of love.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.195
Oh, Mich...

23:31.880 --> 23:34.395
Never a dull moment here in Compliance.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.199
That... That's his company phone?

23:39.200 --> 23:41.317
Isn't that crossing the wall?

23:41.520 --> 23:43.751
Well, technically there's
nothing criminal here.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.511
So Remson doesn't have
a policy prohibiting...

23:46.680 --> 23:49.479
this kind of romantic relationship
between two employees?

23:49.640 --> 23:51.552
Some banks do, but nope.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.791
What's your gut on this guy?

24:00.200 --> 24:01.395
Michael?

24:01.560 --> 24:03.279
He has instincts.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.031
Some people have instincts.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.760
Some people are getting a tip.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.071
And?

24:12.240 --> 24:13.959
We keep our eye on him.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.512
Hello.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.830
Hey.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.434
Here you go.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.796
Thank you.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.999
Remind me why I didn't marry you.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.280
Diamonds.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.510
Remson holiday party, '90-something.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.592
Randall introduced us?

25:14.760 --> 25:17.150
- The St. Regis.
- Yes.

25:17.320 --> 25:21.553
You asked me who bought these...

25:21.720 --> 25:26.556
and I saw you puff up your chest,
ready to fight off some rival...

25:26.720 --> 25:30.600
but then I told you
I bought them for myself.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.878
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.

25:33.920 --> 25:37.470
Yeah, well, men like a girl
they can take care of.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.831
Someone should remind them about alimony.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.114
People seem to like your Cachet thing.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.280
Yeah.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.511
- Remember my friend Marco?
- Um...

25:51.720 --> 25:54.838
Oh, from Stanford, right?
The tech blogger guy?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.515
Yeah, he writes about
encryption and secrecy...

25:57.680 --> 26:00.912
whisper-funds, all that kind of spy shit.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.519
He seemed to think that
Cachet was gonna go well.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.754
We hope so.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.077
Yeah, what about you?

26:09.240 --> 26:11.118
Think they're onto something?

26:12.600 --> 26:14.319
I do.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.790
Have you started due diligence yet?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.590
- Michael.
- Hm?

26:23.560 --> 26:26.871
What, you... You want to build
a Chinese wall in my apartment?

26:27.040 --> 26:32.991
Well, I just... I think it's simpler
and better if we don't talk shop.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.999
Okay.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.472
Okay.

26:43.720 --> 26:47.111
Who's watching us tonight?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.789
Hello? Sam? Sophie wants to know
who's babysitting them tonight.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.151
Uh, Lisa from downstairs.

26:54.320 --> 26:55.800
I hate Lisa.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.792
You don't hate Lisa.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.519
She's got weird hair.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.712
Okay, that is not kind.

27:02.160 --> 27:05.915
- She's not a real babysitter.
- You know, they do have a point.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.912
You know I have rehearsal every Tuesday.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.958
Something came up. It happens.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.079
Drinks? With some friend from childhood?

27:13.240 --> 27:15.675
- I told you, it's work.
- Mm-hm.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.638
Are you investigating her?

27:18.040 --> 27:19.952
Lisa is fine.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.874
You crazies love the games
on her phone, don't you?

27:23.360 --> 27:24.510
Don't you?

27:24.680 --> 27:26.876
Don't you? Who am I gonna get?
Who am I gonna get?

27:28.360 --> 27:29.510
I'm gonna get those feet.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.398
- Hey, you, hey...
- And she's affordable.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.236
You go. I'll wait.
I'm totally gonna get you.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.392
- I'm gonna be late. Got to go.
- You cannot...

27:39.560 --> 27:42.120
You can run, but you cannot hide from me.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.430
They are beautiful.

27:44.320 --> 27:48.109
Ah... I've got a betta.

27:48.920 --> 27:49.956
Which is a fish.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.760
- Yes, I actually knew that.
- Heh.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.594
I'm gonna have to tell
my brother that I saw you.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.070
He thinks that every girl
he ever dated turned gay.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.875
How is he? How is everyone?
Everyone still in Michigan?

28:01.320 --> 28:04.711
Yeah, they're still
in that 30-mile radius.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.439
Do you ever get back there or...?

28:07.080 --> 28:09.117
Um... Talk to them all the time.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.034
But with work and...

28:13.120 --> 28:15.715
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.999
Yeah. Goatee Man is long gone.

28:26.160 --> 28:30.632
Yeah, a little bit more
my type now, I suppose.

28:32.800 --> 28:33.870
So how about you?

28:34.040 --> 28:35.872
Are you seeing anyone or...?

28:37.440 --> 28:38.590
I get what I need.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.638
Oh, do tell.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.712
I'm just a boring old married lady.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.319
Well, he's, uh...

28:46.480 --> 28:48.437
He's smart.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.034
Someone from work?

28:50.200 --> 28:51.998
- Where else?
- Mm.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.199
I dated someone from work once.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.716
But I don't know, it got weird.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.559
It was claustrophobic and...

28:58.720 --> 29:03.033
Well, yeah, I mean, we don't
see each other day-to-day, so...

29:03.200 --> 29:06.159
Smart. So what, a broker?

29:06.320 --> 29:07.720
Actually, yeah, yeah.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.031
Does it ever get...?

29:13.200 --> 29:14.919
- Get...?
- I mean...

29:15.080 --> 29:17.549
there must be certain things
you can't talk about?

29:20.240 --> 29:21.959
What are you doing?

29:23.080 --> 29:26.391
Here I thought we were just
two old friends having a drink.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.040
We are.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.030
- Can I have the check, please?
- Sure.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.838
His name is Michael Connor. C-O-N-N-O-R.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.993
But I don't know,
maybe you already knew that.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.038
No, Naomi, I...

29:47.040 --> 29:50.033
Okay, yes, I may have
come across his name...

29:50.200 --> 29:52.590
in the office as someone who...

29:52.760 --> 29:53.750
Someone who...?

29:53.920 --> 29:56.833
Deals with a lot of hedge funds.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.119
Yep.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.112
That's what he does.

30:04.840 --> 30:06.559
Naomi...

30:14.400 --> 30:15.436
How was drinks?

30:15.600 --> 30:18.638
She's not gonna give us anything.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.874
Look. If we don't have
a good feeling about this one...

30:23.040 --> 30:26.716
We don't need warm, fuzzy fucking
feelings, Frank. We need evidence.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.952
Did your friend in Compliance
send anything over?

30:31.200 --> 30:32.429
Paperwork on Michael.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.680
Now, don't go doing anything rash.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.275
You're not in Narcotics anymore.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.240
He's an old friend.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.357
The man is a top guy...

30:56.320 --> 30:59.074
Just watch me and don't jump in a lot.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.276
Okay.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.794
- Okay, and nod.
- All right.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.037
- Michael.
- Hey.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.112
- How are you?
- Cory.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.079
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Working with us for a while.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.311
We figure it's time
he played with the big boys.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.635
Gentlemen.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.395
Uh, could I get a Macallan 18?

31:18.600 --> 31:20.592
- No ice.
- Of course.

31:20.760 --> 31:23.753
I'll have the same thing. So will he.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.070
Thanks.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.993
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.754
What do you have for us?

31:32.480 --> 31:33.675
Nothing.

31:39.480 --> 31:42.279
I was just out of school
when I met this guy.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.955
He didn't even give a shit
about the money.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.397
Just loves the fucking game of it.

31:48.560 --> 31:51.029
You know, he played like a pro.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.760
When I left, and I started a hedge fund...

31:53.920 --> 31:57.436
he sent a hedgehog to my office.

31:57.640 --> 31:58.994
An actual hedgehog?

31:59.160 --> 32:03.120
Yeah, the box opens,
there was a fucking rodent in my lap.

32:10.960 --> 32:15.113
Oh, God. Heh, heh.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.119
Where is that guy?

32:20.680 --> 32:23.240
What is it? Getting older?

32:23.840 --> 32:25.274
We're all older.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.476
The regulations?

32:27.120 --> 32:28.315
Well...

32:28.480 --> 32:30.312
Where are you going with this?

32:34.800 --> 32:35.870
Macallan.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.160
Thank you.

32:40.360 --> 32:41.476
Thanks.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.200
Now, we have a lot of capital to invest.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.636
And you're gonna bring us something, yeah?

33:06.440 --> 33:08.272
I'm thinking...

33:10.880 --> 33:12.439
privacy.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.359
Privacy?

33:22.520 --> 33:24.557
You with the green pens.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.436
Color of money.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.230
Can you check that the B server
was reset properly last night?

33:48.400 --> 33:50.073
Yeah, for sure.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.839
Did you call Dave over at V-Tech?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.320
- Yeah, of course.
- Good.

33:53.480 --> 33:54.709
Thank you.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.234
All right.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.719
Good afternoon, everyone.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.793
We'd like to start off with a preliminary
discussion of pricing.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.350
- Let's do it. Where are we at?
- At this point...

34:13.520 --> 34:17.911
we're looking at a range of 32
to 34 a share. At 7.2 million a share...

34:18.080 --> 34:21.596
that gives us a valuation of 868 million.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.194
Hang on just a minute.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.636
We have to get a billion-dollar valuation.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.156
We have looked
at the comparables, Ed, and...

34:28.320 --> 34:30.710
You said 34 to 36 in your pitch.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.675
You'll leave tens of millions
of dollars on the table.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.360
We can get at least 35.

34:35.520 --> 34:39.560
This is a balancing act.
Raising money for your company...

34:39.760 --> 34:42.797
while still promising our investors
a deal for coming on board...

34:42.960 --> 34:45.714
Look, you begged me for this IPO.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.632
Do you want me to call Channing Trust?

34:47.800 --> 34:49.598
I don't actually remember begging.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.433
Does anybody else?

34:51.600 --> 34:53.956
No. So, what you want
to avoid here, Ed, is a down...

34:54.120 --> 34:56.840
Because we know what happened
with your last IPO.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.957
I don't think that's relevant here.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.600
Oh.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.549
Ed. Ian.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.758
I believe our goal is to find
the right number for all of us.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.959
- The number's 35.
- Possibly.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.479
But you can think of it like a...
Like a party.

35:22.200 --> 35:25.910
We need to encourage people
to show up to the party.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.912
It could be the best party in the world.

35:28.080 --> 35:30.151
- But if nobody shows up...
- A party?

35:30.320 --> 35:32.994
- Um, I don't really think...
- No, no, hang on.

35:33.160 --> 35:34.799
I get this.

35:36.880 --> 35:37.870
A party.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.194
Go on.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.273
With a 32 to 34 range,
we'll get people in the door.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.874
But if the party's good enough...

35:45.080 --> 35:48.517
- People will line up around the block.
- This is true.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.275
I like you.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.116
You know how to talk to people.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.119
I'll party with you anytime.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.318
Okay, if we're gonna
sell 15 percent of the company now...

35:59.480 --> 36:01.870
we should talk about
our options moving forward.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.952
Yes, we should.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.473
Michael Connor?

36:41.320 --> 36:44.757
Uh... Yes. I'm... I'm sorry.
Have we, um...?

36:44.920 --> 36:45.956
No. Uh...

36:46.120 --> 36:47.349
Samantha Ryan.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.636
U.S. Attorney's Office.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.280
Oh, really?

36:50.440 --> 36:53.433
Well, I was just hoping
we could have a brief chat.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.400
Sure.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.598
My idea of a perfect summer's afternoon.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.150
Brief chat with a long-legged woman...

37:01.360 --> 37:03.636
who might even be working for the FBI.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.280
How thrilling.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.033
I did not say FBI.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.675
And I'm not interested in you.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.192
Oh. How very disappointing.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.959
I'm interested in one of
your clients, Benji Akers.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.680
Yeah, not sure how I can
help you with that.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.998
My relationship with my clients
is strictly confidential.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.470
Of course, but these hedge fund guys...

37:27.680 --> 37:30.957
they always seem to have some
way to stay out of trouble...

37:31.120 --> 37:33.555
but they need someone like you
from the big bank.

37:33.720 --> 37:37.919
Now, you have regulations and
Compliance breathing down your throat.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.992
So if someone's gonna take the fall...

37:40.160 --> 37:44.040
it seems to me it's gonna be you.
Not Benji Akers.

37:44.240 --> 37:46.197
Take the fall for what?

37:46.360 --> 37:47.589
Could be anything.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.400
Merger last spring where some investors...

37:50.560 --> 37:54.440
got a memo prematurely,
or a couple of rogue trades...

37:54.600 --> 37:57.638
- ...that Compliance flags as irregular.
- Ha-ha-ha.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.798
You have nothing on me, do you?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.400
How do you know that?

38:02.880 --> 38:04.917
Oh, this has been lovely.

38:05.080 --> 38:08.551
But why don't you call me...

38:08.760 --> 38:12.436
when you have just
a little bit more leverage?

38:12.640 --> 38:14.711
Is that a challenge?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.150
If you like.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.038
Marin? Hi.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.919
I'm Naomi Bishop.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.833
I... I'm heading the IPO.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.275
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.229
Uh, I wanted to talk to you in the office.
They said you were leaving for the day.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.915
You guys talk to every single employee?

38:53.080 --> 38:55.754
You seem particularly
interested in our process.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.718
In my experience, that usually means...

38:57.880 --> 39:00.315
you have something you want to say to us.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.716
All right.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.349
What happens when Cachet gets hacked?

39:07.520 --> 39:11.230
Hacked? It's anonymized
and encrypted at every level.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.437
Yeah, you haven't met my ex.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.069
We were beta testing.
It was actually kind of helpful.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.880
We plugged all the holes, but...
He'll keep trying.

39:19.080 --> 39:22.517
- There will probably be others.
- Others? What do you mean?

39:22.680 --> 39:24.637
What do you mean what do I mean?

39:24.840 --> 39:27.480
That's what we do for a challenge.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.996
The naked photos, who knows?

39:30.160 --> 39:32.755
All right, it's called
a man-in-the-middle attack.

39:32.920 --> 39:36.630
So users want to be able to access the
network on multiple devices, obviously.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.031
But that opens up the possibility
of somebody...

39:39.200 --> 39:41.032
implanting malware on the key server.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.159
Uh, does Ed know about this?

39:44.360 --> 39:48.070
Yeah, I tried to tell him,
and he said that I was paranoid.

39:48.280 --> 39:52.160
Funny, when a company built on paranoia
thinks that I'm the one who's paranoid.

39:52.320 --> 39:56.280
He's a total prick. I'm the best coder,
and he treats me like I don't exist...

39:56.440 --> 39:58.671
and dismisses everything
that I have to say.

39:58.840 --> 40:01.435
I cannot work at this company anymore.
I need to sell my shares.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.000
- Okay.
- Help me do that?

40:03.160 --> 40:05.117
No. No, I don't do that.

40:05.280 --> 40:08.557
I don't think you understand.
I have other stuff I can do with my time.

40:08.760 --> 40:11.639
I'm planning on starting a hacker space.
We're just waiting on...

40:11.840 --> 40:13.354
I got to go. This is useless.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.514
- They're going public very soon.
- I heard that's a rumor.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.593
- Yeah.
- Have you always wanted to be CEO?

40:25.760 --> 40:27.513
- I would want to be CEO.
- No, actually.

40:27.680 --> 40:31.230
- Really?
- I don't know. I mean...

40:31.400 --> 40:34.791
I can always use more high tops.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.314
- Well, yeah. Ha, ha.
- Everyone needs...

40:36.480 --> 40:40.315
- That's not what I would buy.
- Tasmanian sea trout?

40:40.480 --> 40:42.073
Yummy.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.036
Hi, Naomi.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.350
Hello, Edward.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.273
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.514
Ed...

40:50.680 --> 40:53.991
are you ready to be
the rock star of this road show?

40:54.160 --> 40:56.550
Because people,
they're gonna want to tear...

40:56.760 --> 40:58.831
this hoodie off of you.

41:00.800 --> 41:01.836
Oh, yeah.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.469
I just wanted to make sure
that we're in good shape...

41:04.640 --> 41:08.680
- ...before I take off for New York.
- Oh. I'm in very good shape.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.911
Excellent.

41:11.080 --> 41:14.357
I just have one question for you.
It's probably not a big deal...

41:14.520 --> 41:17.479
but something did come up
during due diligence.

41:17.640 --> 41:22.920
A rumor started that your network,
as encrypted as it is...

41:23.160 --> 41:25.994
might be vulnerable still
to a certain kind of hacker.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.197
- Sounds like you met Marin.
- Yes, actually.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.352
And I was interviewing employees and...

41:30.520 --> 41:33.194
Unfortunately, our business can attract
some colorful characters.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.760
Right.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.715
But you need to make sure
that your employees...

41:37.880 --> 41:39.917
are as much a firewall as your code.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.680
Look.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.717
I can promise you we've never been hacked.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.155
Okay.

41:48.320 --> 41:50.630
In theory, there's a back door
to everything.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.792
But we stay one step ahead.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.553
That's the game.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.634
Good.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.877
That's what I wanted to hear.

42:01.080 --> 42:05.154
Well, you two enjoy your dinner, and...

42:05.320 --> 42:07.232
it's on me.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.914
I should go.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.470
- This was fun. I'll call you tomorrow.
- Sure.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.910
Naomi?

42:20.080 --> 42:21.912
Do you need me to look into this?

42:22.080 --> 42:24.276
I can totally take care of things here.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.909
Well, you seem to be taking care of Ed.

42:28.760 --> 42:31.036
I'm just trying to preserve
the relationship.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.351
Okay, good. So maybe you can find a way...

42:33.520 --> 42:39.437
to get him to sign an indemnity clause,
because if there is any vulnerability...

42:39.600 --> 42:42.798
for our investors here,
we cannot be liable.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.910
I'll handle it.

42:45.120 --> 42:47.874
When Ed hits on you,
which he may have already...

42:48.080 --> 42:50.390
whatever you do with that,
that's your business.

42:50.560 --> 42:56.272
But you have to handle him
professionally and very, very gently.

42:56.440 --> 42:57.954
Okay?

42:58.680 --> 43:00.239
Yeah.

43:00.400 --> 43:01.800
I know how this works.

43:02.320 --> 43:04.471
Good. Excellent.

43:07.840 --> 43:08.910
Nice dress.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.840
What the fuck happened this time?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.310
- What do you mean?
- I got a call from Ed.

43:42.480 --> 43:45.393
It appears you've managed
to rub him the wrong way.

43:45.600 --> 43:48.399
I... I was doing my due diligence.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.478
You can't push too hard.

43:50.640 --> 43:53.235
Cachet provided you with
all the necessary documents.

43:53.440 --> 43:54.635
- Well...
- Ed feels...

43:54.800 --> 43:56.996
like you lack confidence in his IPO!

43:57.160 --> 44:00.437
No one wants to be told
they have an ugly baby!

44:00.600 --> 44:02.319
What is the fucking problem?

44:02.480 --> 44:03.880
There is no problem.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.713
It's a beautiful fucking baby...

44:05.880 --> 44:08.349
and I have absolute confidence
in this IPO.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.350
Terrific.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.398
Great. So are we done here?

44:12.560 --> 44:14.438
Because I've got a road show to launch.

44:14.600 --> 44:15.954
- You pissed off Ed.
- Wait.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.273
- I pissed off Ed?
- What happened?

44:18.440 --> 44:21.558
I told you you have to treat
a guy like that very, very gently.

44:22.360 --> 44:25.671
What happened was I got him
to sign the indemnity clause.

44:27.840 --> 44:29.240
Wait.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.479
- You did?
- Yeah...

44:32.640 --> 44:35.678
because I handled him very, very gently.

44:37.320 --> 44:38.720
Well...

44:39.920 --> 44:40.956
good work.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.279
Thank you.

44:53.240 --> 44:57.234
Cachet is not a social network
with privacy settings.

44:57.840 --> 45:01.629
We're a privacy company
that can build a social network.

45:01.840 --> 45:03.513
You guys want in on this now.

45:03.720 --> 45:06.235
I know the experts are
impressed by your encryption...

45:06.400 --> 45:09.120
but what if I'm a hacker
and I break into your server?

45:09.280 --> 45:11.397
Well, that's why we use
end-to-end encryption.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.751
Unencrypted content
is never on the server.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.958
- Don't forget about ephemeral storage.
- This thing's gonna explode.

45:17.120 --> 45:20.238
- You want to get in now.
- Dude, my dad keeps texting me.

45:20.440 --> 45:21.760
- He wants a piece of Cachet.
- Heh.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.914
We're here to talk about
human connection in the digital age.

45:27.120 --> 45:28.679
People crave this connection.

45:28.840 --> 45:31.514
But they don't want Big Brother
tracking their every move.

45:31.680 --> 45:34.115
They don't want the NSA
monitoring pictures of their kids.

45:34.440 --> 45:35.556
That's where we come in.

45:35.720 --> 45:37.951
Hey, do any of the hotels
in London have pools?

45:38.120 --> 45:39.713
I'll find us a pool, hold on.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.435
- Last time in London, I was wasted.
- Yeah, I remember.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.478
Trying to do your accent for that chick.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.518
I'm gonna be someone's American boy.

45:47.800 --> 45:51.635
You know as well as I do
social media has overtaken the world.

45:51.800 --> 45:55.350
There's Facebook, there's Instagram,
there's Snapchat, there's Twitter...

45:55.560 --> 45:57.472
and if you are anything like me...

45:57.640 --> 45:59.996
privacy is the most important thing.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.629
Knowing that nobody can get
that information about you.

46:02.800 --> 46:05.076
- That's the word. Security and safety.
- All right.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.875
- Yo, we should rent a car.
- Are we not getting cars?

46:08.040 --> 46:09.269
I'm thinking Ferrari, man.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.193
Yeah, do that, see what Naomi says.

46:12.480 --> 46:14.631
Coming in on your left here, pal.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.439
Gonna want to get in on this early.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.069
Oh, my God, thank you so much.
That's so sweet.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.118
This is the genius of Cachet.

46:21.280 --> 46:24.239
They allow you to engage
in that social media world...

46:24.400 --> 46:26.960
but it is locked down. It is airtight.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.077
Big smiles.
We're gonna make a lot of money.

46:45.200 --> 46:46.998
Hey, Bankerchick. Welcome home.

46:47.200 --> 46:48.759
If you're done with room service...

46:48.920 --> 46:51.515
how does homemade truffle pasta sound?

48:20.720 --> 48:23.315
Hey, how'd we do with the wiretap?

48:23.480 --> 48:26.200
Okay. Keep me posted.

48:26.360 --> 48:28.556
I'm gonna get these fuckers.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.759
Five minutes!

48:42.880 --> 48:44.314
Well, hello there.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.477
Thank you, Mike.

48:46.640 --> 48:48.313
Naomi.

48:48.480 --> 48:50.312
John.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.280
So you want to play?

48:55.440 --> 48:56.715
Because I didn't
spend all those Sundays...

48:56.880 --> 48:59.349
working on your swing so you just
ride around in a golf cart.

48:59.520 --> 49:00.874
You want me to play in this?

49:01.080 --> 49:02.514
Oh, yeah, you'd never pass the dress code.

49:02.680 --> 49:05.479
Heh. Well, you can take care of that.
You own the place.

49:05.640 --> 49:07.871
Yeah, well, yeah, I had to do something.

49:08.040 --> 49:10.919
And now I am bored out of my fucking mind.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.232
And now she's backpedaling.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.869
She won't give me anything concrete.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.520
And on paper?

49:22.680 --> 49:24.034
Everything looks perfect.

49:24.200 --> 49:27.671
Our I.T. guys at Remson tested it.
They say this network is as airtight...

49:27.840 --> 49:31.470
- ...as anything they've ever seen.
- So, what's the problem?

49:34.440 --> 49:40.835
There's just this nagging feeling
that after Dynacorps...

49:42.080 --> 49:44.754
John, I just don't want
to make the wrong move here.

49:44.960 --> 49:46.952
Well, that sounds like fear.

49:47.120 --> 49:49.635
And that's not the same thing as instinct.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.515
You know why this business
is a young person's game?

49:54.720 --> 49:57.952
It's the lack of doubt.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.316
So you think I should keep it going?

50:00.480 --> 50:02.551
I'm not gonna tell you what to do, Naomi.

50:02.720 --> 50:06.031
But if the numbers check out,
then it sounds like...

50:06.200 --> 50:09.830
what we're talking about is a rumor here.

50:10.400 --> 50:12.517
And rumors, they're the wild card.

50:12.680 --> 50:15.479
You can't control them.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.836
And once you let them inside your head...

50:18.000 --> 50:20.515
well, you're fucking lost.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.353
Yeah.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.589
God, it must be nice.

50:28.760 --> 50:31.992
- Not to have to give a shit anymore.
- Oh.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.318
Well, I never gave a shit.

50:35.640 --> 50:36.915
Come on.

50:38.320 --> 50:40.391
Can I ask you a question?

50:40.560 --> 50:41.835
What would you have done...

50:42.000 --> 50:44.231
if I got pregnant
when I was working for you?

50:45.560 --> 50:47.119
Would you have kept pushing for me?

50:47.280 --> 50:50.000
- Of course.
- "Of course."

50:50.160 --> 50:52.356
What else are you gonna say?

51:04.200 --> 51:05.759
Woo-hoo.

51:21.120 --> 51:23.237
- Is everything okay?
- Mm-hm.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.993
I'm ready now.

51:35.520 --> 51:37.477
Can you believe it?

51:39.200 --> 51:40.714
No.

51:48.760 --> 51:50.399
This is Erin.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.916
Hello?

51:52.080 --> 51:55.835
Hello? I can't get a signal in here.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.832
- Hon?
- It's that woman I told you about.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.231
Her company might
invest big in Cachet and...

52:00.400 --> 52:02.710
She might tell you
to enjoy your ultrasound.

52:12.240 --> 52:14.072
Okay.

52:18.920 --> 52:21.640
Olives, not twist. Thank you.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.793
It's good to see you again.
All right, take care.

52:27.640 --> 52:29.199
Thank you.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.436
Hi.

52:43.600 --> 52:46.957
I'm sorry, have we, um...? Have we met?

52:47.120 --> 52:49.715
I feel like, uh...

52:51.160 --> 52:52.196
Um...

52:53.840 --> 52:55.115
I'm not sure.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.351
- Sam.
- Cory. Hey.

52:57.520 --> 53:01.230
So lovely. I feel like
it was a cocktail thing downtown...

53:01.400 --> 53:02.595
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:02.760 --> 53:04.672
Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah. Have a seat.

53:04.840 --> 53:06.399
You were talking about your work.

53:06.560 --> 53:10.839
And you were talking about
how it's, um, wait... Titans Fund?

53:11.040 --> 53:12.360
- Is that...?
- Titanite.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.874
- Yeah! Titanite!
- Yeah.

53:16.480 --> 53:20.076
And you were talking about
how it's, like, super intense.

53:20.240 --> 53:24.314
And how you always
have to get a little something extra...

53:24.480 --> 53:27.075
Wait, you called it something. Um...

53:27.600 --> 53:29.193
What did you say?

53:29.360 --> 53:30.589
Edge?

53:30.760 --> 53:32.274
Is that right?

53:33.240 --> 53:35.072
Yeah.

53:36.760 --> 53:39.400
Exactly, yeah. I remember that vividly.

53:39.560 --> 53:41.916
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:45.280 --> 53:48.159
Happy birthday.

53:52.880 --> 53:55.156
Yeah. Very cute.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.596
- I don't know. Looks like it's...
- Ha-ha-ha.

53:57.760 --> 54:01.117
Looks like it could be
a little soft though, huh?

54:01.520 --> 54:04.513
How's everything looking
with the IPO schedule?

54:05.160 --> 54:06.674
Look solid?

54:08.120 --> 54:09.998
I'm working on it.

54:11.760 --> 54:14.878
You need a little Botox?
Little... Little eye lift? Hey.

54:15.040 --> 54:16.474
No, it's... I know a guy.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.677
I'll bear that in mind.

54:20.400 --> 54:22.790
You remember my cousin Evan?

54:23.520 --> 54:26.911
- PJ Ellis?
- Well, not anymore.

54:27.080 --> 54:29.276
After 30 years, yeah.

54:29.440 --> 54:32.638
Didn't make the numbers,
so they pushed him out.

54:33.880 --> 54:35.633
Thirty years, huh?

54:35.800 --> 54:37.598
Fuck.

54:37.760 --> 54:39.672
Yeah. Now he's knocking on my door.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.394
Like I'm gonna hire him.

54:42.800 --> 54:46.555
Fucking tragedy. Nurse!

54:46.960 --> 54:49.634
Ha-ha-ha. That's amazing.

54:49.800 --> 54:53.350
I can't even, like,
balance my own checkbook.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.838
It's very simple when you think about it.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.070
- Just math.
- I know.

55:00.240 --> 55:02.038
What's wrong with me? No, I remember...

55:02.200 --> 55:05.910
last time you were
telling me about, um, you...

55:06.080 --> 55:07.992
Your work and, uh... Oh, yes!

55:08.200 --> 55:11.398
You did this clinical trial or something.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.552
- I don't remember the details.
- We talked about that?

55:13.720 --> 55:15.234
Yes.

55:15.400 --> 55:17.198
We were a little loose-lipped...

55:17.360 --> 55:18.953
- ...if you know what I mean.
- Oopsie.

55:23.680 --> 55:27.151
But no, yeah. You were telling me
how you talked to the scientist...

55:27.320 --> 55:29.551
- ...and everything and...
- Yeah.

55:29.760 --> 55:33.310
I remember it because, um,
it was about MS...

55:33.480 --> 55:35.437
and my mom has that.

55:35.720 --> 55:37.518
Oh, yeah, no, I remember, yeah.

55:37.680 --> 55:39.114
Sorry, yeah.

55:39.280 --> 55:40.760
Yeah, um...

55:40.920 --> 55:44.038
And the scientist, he was some big deal.

55:44.200 --> 55:46.715
I'd read about him. Doctor...

55:46.880 --> 55:49.076
- Dr. S...
- Uh, Dr. Sobel.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.192
- Yes.
- Yeah.

55:51.360 --> 55:52.874
- Dr. Sobel.
- Right.

55:53.040 --> 55:54.872
- Sobel.
- He told you.

55:55.080 --> 55:56.958
And that's how you got the edge.

55:58.480 --> 55:59.596
Shh.

56:01.040 --> 56:03.032
Shh.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.512
- You have to call me.
- Yeah, I sure do.

56:08.480 --> 56:11.279
- Promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

56:19.880 --> 56:22.998
Teddy, hey. I'm just seeing
these last-minute bids.

56:23.160 --> 56:24.230
What else we got?

56:24.440 --> 56:26.830
Xandos and Redding are upping the orders.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.912
This thing is getting hot. Good work.

56:29.080 --> 56:31.037
Keep them coming.

56:33.480 --> 56:35.949
- Thank you, Gloria.
- Do you need anything else?

56:36.160 --> 56:38.436
No, I'm good, thank you.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.398
Is everything okay?

56:40.560 --> 56:42.552
Of course.

56:45.200 --> 56:48.034
You know, I think I'm gonna
finish up at home.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.839
Good night.

57:17.680 --> 57:20.275
Go, go, go.

57:41.040 --> 57:42.520
Fuck.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.229
Naomi, it's Erin.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.909
Call me when you get this. It's important.

57:55.240 --> 57:57.038
- Hi.
- Hey.

57:57.240 --> 57:58.913
Did you get in okay?

58:00.280 --> 58:01.600
Yeah.

58:02.440 --> 58:04.079
We need to talk about that e-mail.

58:05.520 --> 58:07.239
- Do you ever relax?
- Heh.

58:07.880 --> 58:09.360
- Have a drink.
- I'd love to.

58:09.520 --> 58:11.796
But there are a million things
going on tomorrow.

58:11.960 --> 58:16.352
- And...
- This place does an amazing martini.

58:16.520 --> 58:18.955
- Uh, Ed?
- Mm.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.430
We've got to keep
our eye on the ball here.

58:21.640 --> 58:23.120
Yeah.

58:36.840 --> 58:41.039
Listen, those personnel changes
that you were referring to...

58:41.240 --> 58:44.597
Come on, Erin. You're what, a VP?

58:44.760 --> 58:48.993
If I really want to talk
business, I'll call Naomi.

58:55.360 --> 58:57.317
- Erin.
- Excuse me.

58:58.560 --> 59:00.074
Come on.

59:21.440 --> 59:23.477
Where the fuck is she?

59:27.760 --> 59:30.400
More? Okay.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.554
One.

59:33.720 --> 59:35.154
Harder, one.

59:35.320 --> 59:36.356
One.

59:42.280 --> 59:44.192
You know, we're gonna change it up.

59:45.200 --> 59:47.237
Greene and Broome.

59:52.640 --> 59:54.279
- Hi.
- Hey.

59:54.480 --> 59:58.315
I'm sorry, so sorry, to bother you.
I'm just wondering if Naomi is here.

59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.473
Uh, no. No, she's not. No.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.314
Yeah, sorry.
Just something came up at work.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.314
I couldn't get ahold of her,
so I thought maybe...

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.675
She's not at her place?

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.280
No.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.556
I'm sorry for showing up here like this.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.915
No, no, no.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.116
It's...

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.351
Hey, it's fine.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.999
Uh, I was just about
to have a glass of wine.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.150
Want one?

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.033
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.669
- Well, come on, come in.
- I don't want to interru...

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.591
Please, come on in.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.040
Okay.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.680
Thanks.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.840
Your kids?

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.596
Yeah, spoiled little shits.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.277
I think they only come to visit me
to pick up their allowances...

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.079
and piss off my ex.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.114
I won't stay long.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.509
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not gonna ask you where else...

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.712
you think she might spend her nights.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.119
We're all grown-ups here.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.113
This is nice.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.760
You said you were having
trouble at work, huh?

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.560
- With Cachet?
- Yeah.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.951
It's just that...

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.879
I actually can't get into it.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.400
No, no, no, of course.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.313
But if you wanted to talk about it...

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.949
talk it through, you know,
you could always use...

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.192
hypotheticals, you know?
And Naomi did mention that...

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.797
she'd hit some kind of snag
with due diligence.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.989
Naomi said that?

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.514
Yeah.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.315
Well, she didn't go
into details, obviously.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.070
You know, we like to think
that it's, uh...

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.916
It's helpful, you know,
talk things through, find a...

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.594
different perspective.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.913
You're telling me Naomi
brings you across the wall?

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.276
Not officially, no.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.476
Come on, sit down.
Those shoes must be killing you.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.751
You're quite the gentleman.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.670
But, you know, Naomi told me
you always have an agenda.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.558
Yes, well... She would. Heh.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:35.355
You know, Erin, everyone has an agenda.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.873
You're trying to make promotion.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.271
You know that. I know that.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.799
You do good work. You kiss up to Naomi.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.040
And then you keep hoping that this year...

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.119
will be the one.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.991
And if it's not the one,
then eventually...

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.871
you have to start thinking
about other avenues.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.637
You seem to think
I'm gonna be giving you...

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.309
some information about my IPO.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.836
We both know how...

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.316
How these things happen.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.592
You know, Erin, I've been working
at Remson a very long time.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.992
It might surprise you, but...

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.836
people there respect my opinion.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:57.115
- Hi.
- I just got your messages.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.760
What kind of problem do we have?

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.470
Naomi, can you just hang on...
Hang on a sec.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.552
- Erin.
- Hold on.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.870
"Hold on"?

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.236
Don't tell me to hold on. I'm your boss.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.234
What the hell happened this time?

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.031
Wait, are you still with Ed?

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.879
No.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.753
I'm at my place.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.717
Okay, so...

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.314
Erin, I need to know what's going on here.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.552
Yeah, sorry.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.959
Yeah, so Ed did let go
of a few people last week.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.351
Yes, that was the recommendation.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.074
And?

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.199
I know, but one of them was Marin.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.031
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.750
She is a liability if she starts making
claims about holes in the network.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.560
I know. Look, I got her number here.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.956
Marin Gold.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.913
Okay, hang on.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.395
Go.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.750
415-555-0192.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.679
Got it.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.234
Well, Erin, hasn't this been lovely?

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.119
What are you gonna do?

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.512
With what?

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.796
You fired Marin? Now?

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.235
Look, it wasn't my call.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.800
Everything is your call.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.599
But we've got it under control.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.231
She got a very nice severance
and Legal had her sign all kinds of shit.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.312
Ed, I am extremely concerned about this.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:51.314
- I wish you had consulted me before...
- Hey, Naomi, news flash:

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.880
I don't work for you.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.912
- I'm...
- Let me tell you something.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.754
These doubts and second-guessing,
I'm getting tired of it.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.152
- We've got orders pouring in?
- Yeah, because I've been doing my job.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.676
But it is also my job to be thorough.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.315
Oh, yeah?

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.080
- I thought it was your job to be inspiring.
- You know, Ed...

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.639
All right, hungry?

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.154
Let's go.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.913
Where you been?

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.311
Sorry, something came up at work.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.756
Hello.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.639
Fuck you!

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.314
This must be Cory.

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:18.550
I Googled you!

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.040
Of course you did.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.037
You're a fucking prosecutor?

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.358
I'm eager to hear more about
your contact with Dr. Sobel.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.799
- You can talk to my lawyer!
- I look forward to it.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.350
We both know your client crossed a line.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.154
Heh. Would you look at him?

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:55.515
He works 80 hours a week.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.877
He's a dad, raises money
for leukemia research.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.234
- I mean...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.790
Does he plant daffodils too?

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.714
Well, he's got no history.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.714
He's never been flagged
by you guys or the SEC.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.398
Are you saying he doesn't know any better?

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.756
I have 6-year-old twins who know better.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:22.712
When you, your boss and your friends
decide to sabotage a company...

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.196
when you have information
that Joe Investor...

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:29.036
couldn't possibly have,
and you use that information...

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:35.117
to profit while Joe Investor loses 65
percent of his retirement fund...

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:38.751
- ...you know better.
- Are you gonna charge my client or not?

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.877
That depends.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.673
He's not the one you want.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.036
There are bigger fish at Titanite.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.435
That's the point.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.671
And he's willing to cooperate?

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.637
I'd like to thank you all for your patience
as we've been processing...

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.237
this tremendous surge in orders
from institutional investors.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:05.189
Our book is closed,
and we have our offering price.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.396
Thirty-five.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.836
We just raised $250 million?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.957
Congratulations.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.715
We'll see how the market trades
tomorrow, but I feel very confident.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.877
- Great, great.
- Good work.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.874
Hm?

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.437
Where did you get that pen?

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.594
I don't know.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.397
Big pain in the ass.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.875
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.754
Cory and I were taking bets on how much
you'd spend on my birthday present.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.952
To many more.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.913
Nice.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.789
What are you drinking?

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.280
Like a porcupine?

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.433
Hedgehog, but cute, fuzzy. Get it?

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.114
Hedge fund, money hog.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.954
- It's a...
- Yeah, I get it. And Benji took it with him?

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.477
- Yep.
- So what does the hedgehog mean?

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.553
I don't know what it means.
It's a hedgehog.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.513
These guys just fuck with each other.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.359
Probably doesn't mean anything.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.712
So, am I done?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.354
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.074
We own you.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.830
Hello?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.117
Marin, it's Naomi Bishop.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.151
Do you understand what's happening here?

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.754
Cachet can sue you.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.952
No, they said they would
take care of that.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.476
Who? Who did?

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.636
Are they paying you?

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.637
Marin, you need to tell me who...

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.234
I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.073
Marin.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.276
Hello?

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.000
Get me a car to Brooklyn, South Slope.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.633
Hi. I'm Naomi.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.917
I'm a friend of Sam's.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.439
Nice shoes.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.319
Is she home?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.394
Come on. I'll get her.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.119
Thank you.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.634
Hello there.

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.638
You must be...

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.436
Sophie and... And William, right?

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.432
I don't talk to strangers.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.950
Oh. Right. Yeah.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.558
Well, it's really your friends
that'll stab you in the back, so...

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.110
- Hey. Uh...
- Oh.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.115
What's up?

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.434
I...

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.355
I want you to tell me what you know...

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.474
about Michael.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.312
You've been investigating him?

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.679
I can't really comment on that.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.349
Somebody leaked a rumor about my IPO.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.477
We go public tomorrow, and somebody...

01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.034
I know.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.399
The tech blogger who posted the story...

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.911
he's an old friend of Michael's
from Stanford.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.993
It had to be him, right?

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.073
Do you think it was?

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.837
Look, as far as this IPO goes...

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.358
we have no specific link
to Michael at this time.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.120
Except you.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.959
Wait, are you saying
I gave him information?

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.713
I am not saying anything.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.355
I should go.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.035
Naomi, wait. I can help you.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:39.519
- Okay, did Michael have access?
- He did not get this from me.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:40.915
Do you understand?

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.471
That is not who I am.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.794
Fuck.

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.999
Are you tanking my IPO?

01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.830
Should I be?

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.071
Don't fuck with me, Michael.
Don't fuck with me now.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.390
Did you leak this thing?

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.396
Is it true?

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.029
It doesn't matter if it's fucking true!

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.272
- You know that. Once the rumors start...
- Hey, hey.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.794
Start your own rumors.

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.519
Do you know how to play this game?

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.315
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.880
What did you do?

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.430
Did you take my phone?

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.113
Are you wearing a wire?

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.794
What do you think?

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.872
Let's take our clothes off and find out.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.793
Jesus.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.996
It's all just a big game to you, isn't it?

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.871
What else is there?

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.680
Hey, listen, whatever happens tomorrow...

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.800
you're gonna be fine.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.680
Fuck, I don't want to be fine!

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.236
I was never supposed to be fine!

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.318
I was supposed to be
a motherfucking rainmaker.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.237
No, that's... No, that's for PR to handle.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.915
They have a long reach. So...

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.634
Hold... No.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.234
Wait. Hold on.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.234
Tell Ed not to make
a public statement, okay?

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.677
I appreciate his enthusiasm, but just...

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.349
Look, wake the fuck up and call me.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.034
So this is a big day
for you and your shareholders.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.556
- Absolutely.
- Now, over the last 12 hours...

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.633
reports have surfaced that show
hackers may be attempting...

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.792
to access this secure network.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.952
So here's the thing. When people hear...

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.356
the word "hackers," they get scared.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.115
We're not scared of hackers.
We employ hackers.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.794
- You employ hackers?
- What...

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.595
Heh. I think
what Ed means is that there's...

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.877
never been a security breach
of our network.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:24.078
I'd like to take this moment
to personally reassure our investors.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:28.917
This morning, I uploaded three photos to
my own profile on the Cachet network.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.438
These photos are of a highly
personal nature, you know what I mean?

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.154
Never been a security breach.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.596
If anyone thinks
they can access my photos...

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.434
- ...I say go ahead, give it a try.
- Well, that...

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.593
certainly should be compelling
for the investors out there.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.753
Fuck.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.752
Coffee, miss?

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.156
Titanite accounts for the last five years.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.751
Deals where someone may have
known a little something extra.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.799
- Hello?
- Is this Samantha Ryan?

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.155
Yeah. Who's this?

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.596
Hi. It's Neera
calling from Bane Recruiting.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.360
I have a position
that will triple your salary.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.276
Yeah, I would love to hear more,
but I'm gonna have to call you back.

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:47.840
Call me when you get a chance.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.310
That sounds great. Thanks.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.279
So? Which bank?

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.919
What, you never been called
by a headhunter before?

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:05.393
Don't you know that's why they call
this place "the departure lounge"?

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.075
I'm the only sucker who's
been here more than a decade.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.192
So why do you stay?

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.439
Uh...

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.156
Well, it ain't for the paycheck.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:20.039
Just do me one favor before
you talk to those guys, okay?

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.590
You've been on a trading floor, right?

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.634
No?

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.079
Honey, you got to go there.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.118
You got to see what we're up against.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.875
You go, you breathe it in.

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:39.274
The hunger of it,
the pure American desire.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.437
Five minutes before the opening bell...

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.037
and all anyone wants to know
is where Cachet will open.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.034
It is not an overstatement
to say that this...

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:52.194
is one of the most highly
anticipated IPOs of the year.

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.280
Hey, we've got FBA at 20 percent,
Xandos at 10.

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.478
- What have we got of foreign?
- Tioros for 15. China for 20.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.792
- Rex Brothers is in for 20 percent.
- I've got Cabreau Fund for 10.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.275
- Milton Group wants 15.
- Good.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.954
- Gonna have Boon Portfolio in a minute.
- Okay.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.316
And there is the opening bell.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.120
Shares of the privacy company
Cachet begin trading today.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.636
The question now is
when they will start trading...

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.314
and at what price.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.879
I've got a bid for 750K at 32.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.110
One mil at 30.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.758
- Okay, are we close?
- Almost there.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.310
- Let's get there.
- We got Redding in for 20 percent.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.960
Hey, hey, hey, wait, no.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.312
- Boon is out.
- What?

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.598
- What are you talking about?
- Boon's hitting the exits.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.478
Milton Ellis is pulling out too.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.359
Fuck.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.109
Okay. Okay.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.632
Jonathan, we need to anchor this thing
right now.

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.958
Is there a problem?

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.477
No. No problem.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.912
- We're finishing the share allocation.
- People are pissing themselves.

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.470
- When are we gonna open?
- Any minute now.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.279
What's the holdup?

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.154
What's our fucking price?

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.995
We're in the 29 to 31 range.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.310
How the fuck did that happen?

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.189
Erin, meet me in the lobby.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.157
Yeah, we need someone up here.

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.154
What's gonna happen up there?

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.790
I don't know. Hopefully
the rumors will die down...

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.713
Did you leak this?

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.512
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.034
I know you were with Michael.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.915
I was not with Michael.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.595
I don't give a shit about that, okay?

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.752
I want to know why you sabotaged this.

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.992
What the fuck did you do?

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.715
- I didn't do anything.
- Yes, you did.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.600
You did, because you needed it, right?

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.159
You don't know what I need.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.515
- Hello?
- You need to look into Erin Manning...

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.074
my VP on this deal.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.596
- Naomi?
- She had contact with Michael.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.515
- I will do that.
- Good.

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.991
You hearing about this?
We got to pull out.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.680
Get us out of this thing now!

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.560
Mikey. What are you wearing?

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.519
Hold on. I think my Lyft is here.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.674
Talk to me.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.399
Where are we?

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.759
We're about to find out.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.440
But keep me posted.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.559
Hey, listen, when we're done,
we should talk.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.439
And there it is.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.917
We have Cachet opening at $28 a share.

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.117
That is well down from the IPO price.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.751
Cachet's investors won't be happy.
I got to be honest, I don't know that...

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.599
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.632
Get the desk. They better be buying.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.519
...expecting a pop on the first day...

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:24.036
Start buying. Start buying!

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.913
Yes, now.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.034
Oh, jeez.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.954
Got no ask.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.918
Where's the fucking bottom on this one?

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.955
Yeah, hi. I, um...
I just have a quick question.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.873
I want to know who the fuck thinks...

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.714
they're gonna make money
off this train wreck.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.311
I want you to wait for it.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.270
I want it at 22.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.399
Twenty-two?

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.830
Here.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.437
- No. No, get that out of my face.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.077
Your concern is truly
almost authentic, but I...

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.754
I would like one of those.

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.998
- Yeah.
- Go.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.315
Hang on. We got bids coming in.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.356
Titanite is buying.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.672
What the hell is...?

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.196
Come on, talk to me!

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.438
- Hey, hey, Mikey.
- Hey, how are you doing?

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.478
Yeah, no, I'm just real proud of you.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.518
- We'll make a lot of money.
- You in town?

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.911
I'm off to the Hamptons.
South. The real Hamptons.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.359
Naomi?

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.630
What is this?

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.593
- That is the...
- You said you wanted it.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.472
How many chocolate chips are in my cookie?

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.189
- Um, heh.
- Did anyone teach you basic math?

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:05.156
Count the fucking chips.

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:07.350
Three.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.557
Three. Yes.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:13.714
And your cookies, I saw them,
and they were oozing with chocolate...

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.909
and my cookie
has three motherfucking chips?

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.040
Let's look at the day that just happened.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.995
Cachet, priced at a very healthy
and confident $35 a share...

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.833
stumbled at the open to $28...

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.992
flopped by the end of the day priced at...

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.800
Let me make sure I get this right, $23.74.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.713
That is definitely not $35 a share.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.237
That's about a third of its value
erased on the first day.

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.592
Cachet not having a good open.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.113
Okay, we know that Titanite was
the only buyer of those shares, right?

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.192
You know how this story goes.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.751
A few days pass, they get this Marin
to retract her statement...

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.640
the stock rallies, and they clean up.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.031
- Call your friend in Compliance.
- Not happening.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.272
Get her to get us the personnel file
for Erin Manning.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.800
She's not gonna do that.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.873
- Why?
- Because she'll lose her job.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.680
You got to let go of this.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.113
Compliance is asking for you.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.356
Got it.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:42.240
Okay, thanks. Okay.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.437
- Hi.
- I know you're familiar...

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.991
with the regulations that keep
the investment banking transactions...

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.391
- ...separate from the sales and trading.
- Of course.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.034
Did you have contact
with Michael Connor...

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.398
three days before the Cachet offering?

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.314
Uh... I'm sorry.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.034
Do I need a lawyer or...?

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.954
Well, essentially, we are your lawyers.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.715
- For the moment.
- Right.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.317
I spoke to Michael that night
briefly about a colleague.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.110
- You didn't discuss the Cachet deal?
- No.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:20.156
I'm sure Michael
would tell you the same thing.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.277
Michael Connor
no longer works at the firm.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.117
He moved to Titanite.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.471
That was him? Your new global head?

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.793
Look at me.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.280
Have the respect
to look me in the fucking eye...

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.513
and tell me if that man
out there is my new boss.

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.236
The department needs a new face.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.072
Don't give me that.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.319
You lost control of the story.

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:30.678
Cachet will rally, just like Facebook.

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:35.277
Naomi, it's like I told you.

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.834
This just isn't going to be your year.

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.551
When is my year?

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.713
Hm?

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.477
When is it my fucking year?

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.440
Naomi?

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.719
Did you see her?

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.357
Heh. Nobody wants to say goodbye.

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.593
So, what happens to the rest of us?

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.559
Well, apparently
Erin is moving up in the world.

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.876
My uncle called me this morning
and asked about you.

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.032
He's got some huge deal coming up.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.793
Wanted to know if you give 100 percent...

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:03.520
because he said this thing
would be your whole life.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.751
So I told him you were a pro.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.512
Congratulations.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.319
Thank you.

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.520
I'm surprised you called back...

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.752
because you have a reputation
for being a bit unorthodox.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.955
I get the job done.

01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.032
However I can.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.078
This would be a big transition for you.

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.630
- Yeah.
- Coming over into the corporate world.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:08.231
The thing is, I have a family and...

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.313
I'm looking forward
to having a sense of stability...

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.120
and to really be a...

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:17.319
You know what? No. Um...

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:20.758
That's not it. Uh...

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.672
The truth is...

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.434
I want to make some money.

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.638
I could say something more nuanced...

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:35.272
about my dreams and aspirations, but...

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.389
that's the honest truth.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.751
I am so glad...

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:48.560
that we can sit here as women
and talk about ambition.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:55.077
But money doesn't have to be a dirty word.

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.630
We can like that too.

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.436
...disappointment initially...

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.030
Finally today...

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.993
tech company Cachet
is back in the spotlight...

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.193
with another surge in share price
this week, as the stock...

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.750
continues to rally
following a disappointing IPO.

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:00.639
Cachet, whose stock
has been steadily climbing...

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:03.150
after that terrible debut
earlier this year...

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.960
has by now made a lot
of its investors very wealthy...

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.919
if they were able to hold on
tight during that steep drop.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.595
...saw this with Facebook
and Square where a stock rallies...

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:12.995
and the IPO fades into the distance...

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.880
as investors track the growth
of the company over time.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.555
What seemed like a disaster
at the initial offering...

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:22.555
could turn out to be just a speed bump
on the road to enormous gains.
