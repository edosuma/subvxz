01:12.971 --> 01:15.371
This tea is tepid, Mr. Lint.

01:15.373 --> 01:16.740
I'm sorry, Sir Lionel.

01:16.742 --> 01:19.609
It's a cold night,
and we're a long way from shore.

01:19.611 --> 01:21.910
Shh! Do you hear that?

01:21.912 --> 01:23.182
Mm-mm.

01:24.215 --> 01:28.317
Ah, yes. The perfect spot.
Now, we have work to do.

01:28.319 --> 01:29.955
Break out the bagpipes.

01:34.159 --> 01:35.892
<i>♪ Mi ♪</i>

01:35.894 --> 01:40.296
<i>♪ La mi-mi-mi-mi ♪</i>

01:40.298 --> 01:41.363
<i>♪ Mi-mi ♪</i>

01:41.365 --> 01:43.001
Very good. Okay, here we go.

01:56.781 --> 01:59.482
Do you think
this will work, sir?

02:01.385 --> 02:04.520
They do say music soothes
the savage beast, Mr. Lint.

02:04.522 --> 02:05.922
I'm not sure
in this case, sir.

02:05.924 --> 02:07.823
Is the camera to hand?
It is essential.

02:07.825 --> 02:09.592
Under your seat, sir.

02:09.594 --> 02:10.860
Good.

02:10.862 --> 02:13.130
Let those fellows
at the club scoff

02:13.132 --> 02:15.367
when faced
with irrefutable proof.

02:16.901 --> 02:18.903
I should've joined
the army.

02:30.514 --> 02:32.984
- Sir Lionel?
- Hmm?

02:33.618 --> 02:35.952
Darwin's finches! She's real!

02:35.954 --> 02:38.520
I knew it. I knew it.

03:04.015 --> 03:07.417
Oh, she's a spirited one,
isn't she? Ha-ha!

03:07.419 --> 03:09.953
- Hold this, will you?
- Whoa!

03:11.088 --> 03:12.489
Ah, okay.

03:14.393 --> 03:15.728
Oh!

03:17.229 --> 03:18.661
Oh!

03:18.663 --> 03:21.496
A little to the right, please.

03:21.498 --> 03:23.132
No, no, no. My right.

03:23.134 --> 03:25.500
That's it, that's it.
Now, what do we say?

03:25.502 --> 03:26.870
Help me!

03:26.872 --> 03:28.905
No, Mr. Lint.
What else do we say?

03:28.907 --> 03:30.607
My hands are bleeding!

03:30.609 --> 03:32.775
- Can we say "cheese"?
- Please!

03:32.777 --> 03:34.112
Close enough.

03:36.848 --> 03:39.117
Oh!

03:40.519 --> 03:42.087
A carnivore. Huh.

04:54.860 --> 04:58.030
Do buck up, Mr. Lint.
No harm done.

04:58.463 --> 05:01.834
Aah!

05:11.744 --> 05:13.776
Oh, fiddlesticks.

05:31.762 --> 05:33.632
<i>I quit!</i>

05:34.165 --> 05:36.533
I can't take any more of this.
I won't!

05:36.535 --> 05:39.868
You were mauled
by a prehistoric lake monster.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.605
How many people
can claim that?

05:41.607 --> 05:44.106
None.
Because they're all dead!

05:44.108 --> 05:46.041
I thought you
were made of sterner stuff.

05:46.043 --> 05:49.913
What is wrong with you?
I'm a human being!

05:49.915 --> 05:52.350
Yes, one of over
one-and-a-half billion.

05:52.951 --> 05:55.851
But that creature,
on the other hand,

05:55.853 --> 05:58.154
is one of a kind.
Don't you see?

05:58.156 --> 06:00.856
Oh, I see perfectly well.

06:00.858 --> 06:03.493
It's no wonder
you can't keep anyone around.

06:03.495 --> 06:04.961
Do stay, Mr. Lint.

06:04.963 --> 06:08.029
I'll make absolutely sure you
don't get eaten again. I promise.

06:08.031 --> 06:09.699
You said that last time!

06:09.701 --> 06:12.769
If I'm ever to be taken seriously
by the adventuring community,

06:12.771 --> 06:15.938
I must...
I must provide proof, yes.

06:15.940 --> 06:19.175
You see, my mistake was relying
on these newfangled cameras.

06:19.177 --> 06:22.077
We'll go back.
We'll get some real evidence.

06:22.079 --> 06:23.913
- We can...
- No, we shall not.

06:23.915 --> 06:26.550
You, sir, are on your own.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.254
Uh...

06:29.822 --> 06:31.223
Oh, bother.

06:47.404 --> 06:48.473
Ew.

06:52.677 --> 06:57.046
"Dear Sir Lionel Frost,
as famed seeker of mythical beasts,

06:57.048 --> 06:59.182
"you may be interested
in this proposition.

06:59.184 --> 07:02.718
"I can reveal to you the
as-yet-undiscovered creature

07:02.720 --> 07:04.887
"known as the Sasquatch.

07:04.889 --> 07:09.091
"Follow the trail along Old
Kemp Creek in Washington State,

07:09.093 --> 07:10.760
"and you will find him.

07:10.762 --> 07:13.564
"I am truly the real deal,
and I...

07:14.899 --> 07:17.036
I believe you are, too."

07:17.701 --> 07:19.271
Huh.

07:25.711 --> 07:27.844
Old Kemp Creek. I knew it.
Ha-ha!

07:27.846 --> 07:30.413
The game is afoot!

07:30.415 --> 07:34.884
Ha-ha! A foot.
It's a... Hmm. Right.

08:06.785 --> 08:10.086
Oh, it's you. You know
I have strict orders not to...

08:10.088 --> 08:12.120
Yes, yes, very good,
thank you.

08:12.122 --> 08:14.289
<i>There he stood before me,</i>

08:14.291 --> 08:17.293
<i>his wicked heathen eyes
locked on mine.</i>

08:17.295 --> 08:21.430
<i>No sound but the wind whistling
through his grass skirt.</i>

08:21.432 --> 08:24.401
Then, in a flash,
I fell to one knee,

08:24.403 --> 08:26.570
thrust my hand down
my trouser leg,

08:26.572 --> 08:30.238
whipped out a pistol I had
concealed against my inner thigh,

08:30.240 --> 08:32.207
aimed it
right between his eyes,

08:32.208 --> 08:35.044
and dropped him where he stood quicker
than you could say, "God save the Queen."

08:35.046 --> 08:36.445
How do you like that, hmm?

08:36.447 --> 08:37.716
A noble battle.

08:38.182 --> 08:40.215
Thank heaven he wasn't armed.

08:40.217 --> 08:42.184
And then what happened?

08:42.187 --> 08:44.253
Uh, I wasn't
out of the woods yet.

08:44.255 --> 08:46.189
Not by a long shot.

08:46.191 --> 08:49.792
The one thing that still
stood in my way was...

08:49.794 --> 08:50.960
Sir Lionel Frost!

08:55.700 --> 08:56.831
Gentlemen...

08:56.833 --> 08:58.267
I bring thrilling news.

08:58.269 --> 09:00.936
Oh, it's the monster hunter.

09:00.938 --> 09:04.006
This club is for members only.

09:04.008 --> 09:05.709
What is it this time, Frost?

09:05.711 --> 09:08.643
Did you come
to tell us about Nessie?

09:08.645 --> 09:10.613
Ah, Lord Piggot-Dunceby.

09:10.615 --> 09:13.882
Why don't you show us what proof
you found in the loch, hmm?

09:13.884 --> 09:17.920
Yes, a regrettable conclusion to an
otherwise rather promising expedition.

09:17.922 --> 09:19.189
Uh...

09:19.191 --> 09:21.190
But I'm not here
to bemoan past misfortune.

09:21.192 --> 09:24.060
I am here to unveil my latest

09:24.062 --> 09:26.595
and most tantalizing enterprise,
gentlemen.

09:26.597 --> 09:28.397
Here he goes again.

09:28.399 --> 09:29.965
- Now wait.
- Give it up, man.

09:29.967 --> 09:32.935
- What I have here is a cast...
- Oh!

09:32.937 --> 09:36.305
...of a giant,
non-human footprint.

09:36.307 --> 09:39.443
- That's a big foot.
- I bet he's a big fellow. Heh.

09:39.445 --> 09:42.377
One of dozens of documented
eyewitness reports

09:42.379 --> 09:44.313
of a mysterious creature.

09:44.315 --> 09:46.248
- Do you mind?
- Oh.

09:46.250 --> 09:49.051
Huge, hairy,
and walking upright.

09:49.053 --> 09:50.219
Neither ape nor man,

09:50.221 --> 09:52.921
but the link in between.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.190
Yes, he's had many names:

09:55.192 --> 09:57.093
Skookum, Rougarou,

09:57.095 --> 10:00.897
Tse'nahaha, Loo Poo Oi'Yes...

10:00.899 --> 10:05.468
...and most commonly known in... in a muddled
derivation of an old Halkomelem dialect,

10:05.470 --> 10:08.970
- as Sasquatch.
- Heh. That'll never catch on.

10:08.972 --> 10:12.474
I offer you a glimpse of a
legendary creature lost in time

10:12.476 --> 10:14.377
and proof...
proof, I tell you...

10:14.379 --> 10:18.348
that man's primate ancestors are not
just tall tales and flights of fancy,

10:18.350 --> 10:20.815
but alive and well

10:20.817 --> 10:23.486
and living in the New World.

10:23.488 --> 10:24.454
Ha-ha!

10:24.456 --> 10:26.455
- The very thought of it.
- Well, I never!

10:26.457 --> 10:28.623
- Poppycock!
- But think of it.

10:28.625 --> 10:32.261
Evidence of man's primitive
ancestry, the missing link!

10:32.263 --> 10:35.196
No, sir, I shan't think of it.
I won't.

10:35.198 --> 10:36.866
- Uh...
- Look around you.

10:36.868 --> 10:40.705
You stand beneath the most
renowned adventurers of the world.

10:41.072 --> 10:43.739
The members of this club
have crossed oceans,

10:43.741 --> 10:47.042
tamed jungles,
conquered the tallest peaks.

10:47.044 --> 10:49.278
We've butchered the ungodly...

10:49.280 --> 10:51.446
...and brought good
British table manners

10:51.448 --> 10:53.782
to savages the world over.

10:53.784 --> 10:58.320
You, sir, seek to make
a mockery of us.

10:58.322 --> 11:00.422
No, no, no.
I seek to join you.

11:00.424 --> 11:02.358
And the discovery
of this creature

11:02.360 --> 11:04.292
must surely secure
my place here.

11:04.294 --> 11:06.262
I mean,
what do you say to that?

11:06.264 --> 11:10.032
I say we are descended
from great men,

11:10.034 --> 11:12.504
not great apes.

11:18.176 --> 11:21.310
Well, I say you're wrong.

11:21.312 --> 11:23.179
What?

11:23.181 --> 11:25.815
I... I believe
the two go hand in hand,

11:25.817 --> 11:28.550
- and what's more, I...
- What did he say to me?

11:28.552 --> 11:30.018
I think he said you're wrong.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.954
I have heard enough.

11:32.956 --> 11:34.958
Your words are nothing.

11:35.659 --> 11:39.195
My word is everything.
What is yours worth?

11:41.899 --> 11:44.369
I beg your pardon?

11:44.869 --> 11:49.271
I give you my word I'll bring
back proof of this creature,

11:49.273 --> 11:52.574
and in return,
you'll admit you're wrong,

11:52.576 --> 11:55.145
and you'll grant me
membership here,

11:55.147 --> 11:58.080
so I might finally take my
place where I truly belong.

11:58.082 --> 12:02.887
You do not belong here,
and you will fail.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.921
Well, in that case,
you have nothing to lose.

12:12.429 --> 12:14.430
Very well.

12:14.432 --> 12:16.065
You'll swear on it?

12:16.067 --> 12:17.735
I will.

12:18.602 --> 12:20.335
Then you'll excuse me
if I take my leave.

12:20.337 --> 12:22.905
I, uh...
I have much to prepare.

12:22.907 --> 12:24.306
Thank you.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.844
Until next we meet, gentlemen.

12:32.283 --> 12:35.218
These are dark days, Collick.

12:35.220 --> 12:39.421
Electricity, suffrage,
evolution.

12:39.423 --> 12:41.657
We are on the brink
of a precipice.

12:41.659 --> 12:44.426
Yes, mark my words.
And the ground beneath us

12:44.428 --> 12:48.330
is clawed away by these...
these new thinkers.

12:48.332 --> 12:49.931
They'll change the world,

12:49.933 --> 12:52.167
and there'll be no room in it
for the likes of me.

12:52.169 --> 12:53.636
But, my Lord,

12:53.638 --> 12:57.305
Frost's frivolous escapades
usually amount to naught.

12:57.307 --> 12:59.141
He can't possibly win
this wager.

12:59.143 --> 13:01.109
I'm not taking any chances!

13:01.111 --> 13:05.281
No, I must make a stand
for all that is civilized.

13:05.283 --> 13:08.383
But how are you going
to do that, my Lord?

13:08.385 --> 13:10.185
Gonna hire a thug to kill him.

13:10.187 --> 13:12.320
Oh, yes. That'll do it.

16:10.201 --> 16:12.137
Hello?

16:13.203 --> 16:15.239
Hmm.

16:34.192 --> 16:36.161
Shh!

16:45.202 --> 16:46.704
Stop, please!

16:49.440 --> 16:51.977
Please wait!

17:38.455 --> 17:39.720
It's still there.

17:43.161 --> 17:46.328
Excuse me. I think I've got a
little something stuck in my...

17:46.330 --> 17:48.363
There it is.

17:48.365 --> 17:51.267
In my throat.
Like a nut or a...

17:51.269 --> 17:54.003
or a field mouse or something like that.
I don't know.

17:54.005 --> 17:57.706
Am I rambling? I'm a little
nervous, if I'm being honest.

17:57.708 --> 17:59.009
I...

17:59.742 --> 18:01.477
Sir Lionel Frost, I presume.

18:01.479 --> 18:02.780
Hi.

18:09.820 --> 18:12.688
I don't believe it.

18:12.690 --> 18:14.489
I mean, you can speak.

18:14.491 --> 18:17.861
Yes. And, um, I write as well.

18:18.496 --> 18:20.796
My penmanship isn't great,
but, uh...

18:20.798 --> 18:22.998
you know,
opposable thumbs and...

18:23.000 --> 18:24.699
fat fingers, you know?

18:24.701 --> 18:26.602
How can you speak?

18:26.604 --> 18:28.237
Good question.
How can I speak?

18:28.239 --> 18:30.206
Well, I watched at first.
I listened.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.974
I paid attention
to a lot of things.

18:31.976 --> 18:36.045
I learned, I stole books,
newspapers here and there.

18:36.047 --> 18:38.314
Um, an old shaman in the valley
helped me a little.

18:38.316 --> 18:40.349
Not only that, he taught me
how to play chess.

18:40.351 --> 18:42.116
- Smart shaman.
- Not really.

18:42.118 --> 18:45.120
I mean, I beat him every time.
He's a lousy player.

18:45.122 --> 18:47.323
And he cheats. He's a cheater.

18:47.325 --> 18:49.926
You're exactly as I imagined.

18:49.928 --> 18:53.028
Eight feet tall,
chest circumference 70 inches,

18:53.030 --> 18:54.997
total weight
around 650 pounds.

18:54.999 --> 18:57.533
Well, I'd say it's more like,
you know, 630 pounds.

18:57.535 --> 19:00.236
You know, it's the hair that
makes me look heavier, I think.

19:00.238 --> 19:03.005
It's a... It's a little deceptive.
It can be frustrating.

19:03.007 --> 19:05.673
Oh! Look at the size
of those metatarsals.

19:05.675 --> 19:08.276
Whoa, sir! Wow, your hands!

19:08.278 --> 19:11.479
- Do you mind if I smell you?
- Um, yeah, sure.

19:11.481 --> 19:12.981
I mean, I bathed recently.

19:12.983 --> 19:14.949
You know, like,
two weeks ago in a creek.

19:14.951 --> 19:16.751
Uh, so, should...
You didn't drink from the creek, did you?

19:16.753 --> 19:18.854
Remarkable.

19:18.856 --> 19:21.789
Uh, wait.
So, you called me by my...

19:21.791 --> 19:23.459
How do you know me?

19:23.461 --> 19:25.829
I wrote the letter.

19:28.465 --> 19:30.565
You wrote this?

19:30.567 --> 19:33.567
You asked me here
to discover you?

19:35.006 --> 19:36.872
Oh, discov... No, no, no.

19:36.874 --> 19:39.240
I asked you here to help me.

19:39.242 --> 19:40.979
Over this way.

19:44.914 --> 19:47.882
Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed.
Sorry if it smells a little.

19:47.884 --> 19:49.753
I don't entertain that much.

19:50.586 --> 19:51.888
Ever.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.157
If I might ask,
how did you find me?

19:54.159 --> 19:56.961
Oh, well,
I've read all about you.

20:01.965 --> 20:03.699
I think that one's
my favorite, right there.

20:03.701 --> 20:05.133
Let's see. I think
there might be a picture.

20:05.135 --> 20:07.469
Yes. You can't believe
everything you read, can you?

20:07.471 --> 20:09.005
Let's move along, shall we?

20:09.007 --> 20:12.542
So, I need someone who knows
the wild places of the world,

20:12.544 --> 20:14.977
someone who believes
in my existence,

20:14.979 --> 20:17.179
but, you know,
doesn't want to shoot me.

20:17.181 --> 20:19.984
You're not gonna shoot me, are you?

20:21.286 --> 20:25.388
But if you'd explain,
what exactly do you ask of me?

20:25.390 --> 20:27.756
Take me away from this place.

20:27.758 --> 20:30.228
I'm lonely.

20:31.929 --> 20:34.462
Your world,
it... it grows bigger.

20:34.464 --> 20:36.199
Mine is eaten away.

20:36.934 --> 20:39.436
You know, there's nothing
for me here anymore.

20:40.104 --> 20:43.338
I've walked these woods year after
year, but I'm the last.

20:43.340 --> 20:45.173
I have none of my kind
to live with,

20:45.175 --> 20:48.776
no...
no family.

20:48.778 --> 20:50.347
Really, nobody.

20:51.347 --> 20:52.383
But...

20:53.284 --> 20:55.017
many miles away,
on the other side of the world,

20:55.019 --> 20:57.353
they talk of this...
this creature.

20:57.355 --> 20:58.886
He's a snowman.

20:58.888 --> 21:01.725
- A yeti?
- And... And look at this.

21:02.192 --> 21:05.393
I think these yetis
are my cousins.

21:05.395 --> 21:07.330
They're... They're my kind.

21:07.798 --> 21:09.765
I want to go to that
cold place and find them.

21:09.767 --> 21:11.533
And then...

21:11.535 --> 21:15.406
um, I wouldn't have to spend
the rest of my life alone.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.442
Can you just take me there?

21:19.242 --> 21:20.511
Please?

21:22.413 --> 21:24.380
Take you to the Himalayas?

21:24.382 --> 21:26.315
I can't possibly.

21:26.317 --> 21:28.116
Yes, you can.
If anyone can, it's you.

21:28.118 --> 21:30.320
You're a...
You're a great man.

21:32.155 --> 21:35.457
Mm, that's a tantalizing
proposition, I'll admit.

21:36.961 --> 21:38.259
You must understand,

21:38.261 --> 21:41.763
my objective here
was to find proof of you.

21:41.765 --> 21:44.400
Um, my name depends upon it.

21:44.402 --> 21:45.933
Proof? What kind of proof?

21:45.935 --> 21:48.437
Incontrovertible evidence
of your existence

21:48.439 --> 21:49.939
to prove my doubters wrong,

21:49.941 --> 21:51.907
uh, like hair samples,
a tooth,

21:51.909 --> 21:53.441
nail clippings, feces.

21:53.443 --> 21:55.943
Well, I have all those things.
That seems like a fair deal.

21:55.945 --> 21:57.446
In that case, why not?

21:57.448 --> 22:01.083
I shall get you there,
to the place you belong.

22:01.085 --> 22:04.921
And in return,
you will get me to mine.

22:04.923 --> 22:08.155
Oh, yes. I'll prove the
existence of not just one,

22:08.157 --> 22:11.726
but an entire evolutionary
branch of missing links.

22:11.728 --> 22:13.296
Imagine the headlines then.

22:13.298 --> 22:16.200
Oh, wow! You really mean that?
You're gonna take me?

22:16.601 --> 22:19.401
Of course. I give you my word.

22:19.403 --> 22:21.205
Okay. What is it?

22:22.138 --> 22:23.939
- What?
- Your word.

22:23.941 --> 22:25.039
No, it's a figure of speech.

22:25.041 --> 22:27.110
Sounds good. What is it?

22:27.877 --> 22:30.345
The word, my dear fellow,

22:30.347 --> 22:32.049
is "trust."

22:33.784 --> 22:35.750
Oh, so, you want
the poop now?

22:35.752 --> 22:37.151
No, later will be fine.

22:37.153 --> 22:38.987
Right. And...
what do I call you?

22:38.989 --> 22:41.856
I mean, if we're to travel halfway
across the globe, you'll need a name.

22:41.858 --> 22:44.959
Well, there's never really been anyone
around to give me a name, you know?

22:44.961 --> 22:46.694
Hmm. That won't do.

22:46.696 --> 22:50.865
I... I think I still carry the
papers of my valet, Mr. Lemuel Lint.

22:50.867 --> 22:53.369
We'll simply change
the "T" to a "K,"

22:53.371 --> 22:55.737
and then we have
the perfect cover story.

22:55.739 --> 22:57.171
Mr. Link.

22:58.342 --> 23:00.676
You know,
like... missing link.

23:00.678 --> 23:02.177
Ah!

23:02.179 --> 23:03.545
Wait, I don't get it.

23:03.547 --> 23:06.081
Uh, fine. Then to business.
We have much to do.

23:06.083 --> 23:07.382
Yes, sir. Where do we start?

23:07.384 --> 23:10.318
With the work of the late
Aldous Fortnight.

23:10.320 --> 23:14.922
He and I shared the same, um,
shall we say, pursuits.

23:14.924 --> 23:16.892
Yes, before
his untimely death.

23:16.894 --> 23:19.661
A singular man.
Primatologist, poet laureate,

23:19.663 --> 23:21.997
and sometime fullback for
the Blackheath Football Club.

23:21.999 --> 23:23.431
Oh, I like the sound
of that guy.

23:23.433 --> 23:26.901
Spent much of his life
searching for the elusive yeti.

23:26.903 --> 23:30.441
And the best part of all,
he drew a map.

23:46.723 --> 23:49.357
- All right, let me just... Can I just ask a...
- Hmm?

23:49.359 --> 23:52.361
You think Mr. Fortnight's widow
will give it to us, just like that?

23:52.363 --> 23:55.530
Don't fret, Mr. Link.
You just leave Adelina to me.

23:55.532 --> 23:58.866
Oh. Oh, so, the two of you
are acquainted.

23:58.868 --> 24:00.634
Hoo-hoo!

24:00.636 --> 24:02.103
You can say that again.

24:02.105 --> 24:04.405
Okay. So, the two of you
are acquainted.

24:04.407 --> 24:08.777
What I...
What I mean is, Adelina and I were...

24:08.779 --> 24:11.747
well, more than
just acquaintances.

24:11.749 --> 24:12.881
Oh.

24:12.883 --> 24:14.285
Oh...

24:14.817 --> 24:16.086
Oh!

24:16.886 --> 24:21.190
Wait a second. I said, "Oh!" like I knew
what you were talking about, but I don't.

24:21.192 --> 24:23.159
Never mind.
First things first.

24:23.161 --> 24:25.559
We shall get some sleep
and sustenance.

24:25.561 --> 24:27.664
Whoo! I barely know you.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.632
What, here?

24:30.634 --> 24:32.500
You know what? I'm fine.
I'll wait out here.

24:32.502 --> 24:33.901
We'll keep a low profile

24:33.903 --> 24:35.269
and be out of here
by first light.

24:35.271 --> 24:37.139
- I can't go in there.
- Well, not as you are, no.

24:37.141 --> 24:40.240
But at the very least,
we should cover up your, uh...

24:40.242 --> 24:42.711
... modesty.

24:42.713 --> 24:44.048
Put this on.

24:46.583 --> 24:49.250
Sir Lionel, I'm a little
afraid that this isn't gonna work.

24:49.252 --> 24:51.554
Oh, come now.
I imagine everyone in there

24:51.556 --> 24:53.788
has hairy knuckles
and poor hygiene.

24:53.790 --> 24:55.492
You'll fit right in.

25:09.440 --> 25:12.076
Hmm.

25:14.044 --> 25:15.446
Ooh! Excuse me.

25:25.021 --> 25:27.557
Hmm.

25:33.730 --> 25:35.031
What can I get you?

25:35.598 --> 25:37.699
Hmm. We'll need lodging
for the night.

25:37.701 --> 25:40.701
And a cup of Earl Grey tea
with a spot of milk.

25:40.703 --> 25:43.307
And please don't let it steep
too long. Thanks so much.

25:45.776 --> 25:47.412
I'm good.

25:52.383 --> 25:54.451
<i>Lionel Frost.</i>

25:55.051 --> 25:57.119
Sir Lionel Frost, actually.

25:58.321 --> 26:00.889
Um, you seem to have me
at a disadvantage.

26:00.891 --> 26:02.857
And that's just how I like it.

26:02.859 --> 26:05.294
Willard Stenk.
Pleased to meet you.

26:05.296 --> 26:08.296
Ah, Stenk.
Yes, I know of your work.

26:08.298 --> 26:10.664
You've tracked,
trapped and butchered

26:10.666 --> 26:13.000
every rare creature
from here to Borneo.

26:13.002 --> 26:14.835
You're gonna make me blush here.

26:14.837 --> 26:17.205
And by my reckoning,
there's one that has eluded you

26:17.207 --> 26:18.840
for 30 years or more.

26:18.842 --> 26:20.307
Is that right?

26:20.309 --> 26:24.145
The Sasquatch appears
to have you beat, Mr. Stenk.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.814
The Sasquatch? Ha!

26:25.816 --> 26:29.418
If you think you can do better,
Frost, you're out of your mind.

26:29.420 --> 26:32.453
You hear me? Barking mad.

26:32.455 --> 26:33.657
Mm.

26:48.672 --> 26:49.738
Woof.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.573
No. It can't be.

26:51.575 --> 26:53.941
Oh, but I'm afraid it can.
And it is.

26:53.943 --> 26:55.844
And you didn't. And I did.

26:55.846 --> 26:57.511
Mmm. You're beautiful.

26:57.513 --> 27:01.016
Um, can you hold on one second?
I'm uncomfortable.

27:01.018 --> 27:04.152
Don't believe a word of it.
He'd sooner see you stuffed

27:04.154 --> 27:06.154
or have your head
mounted on a wall,

27:06.156 --> 27:09.891
and perhaps use your foot as one of those,
you know, buckets you put umbrellas in.

27:09.893 --> 27:12.126
Wha... No, thank you!

27:12.128 --> 27:14.831
Gotta get myself a grip here.

27:15.298 --> 27:18.132
That's better.
Regretfully, Sir Lionel,

27:18.134 --> 27:20.201
turns out the job
I've been hired to do

27:20.203 --> 27:21.603
ain't no fool's errand
after all.

27:21.605 --> 27:23.438
- Oh?
- I've been paid a pretty sum

27:23.440 --> 27:26.174
to stop you and this creature

27:26.176 --> 27:29.611
from ever reaching
civilized society.

27:29.613 --> 27:30.612
Quite a catch.

27:30.614 --> 27:33.782
I get to bag two legends
in one day.

27:33.784 --> 27:34.951
Oh, I wouldn't count on it.

27:42.025 --> 27:42.990
Hmm?

27:51.434 --> 27:52.534
Aah!

27:52.536 --> 27:53.538
Aah!

28:09.219 --> 28:10.555
Aah! Uh!

28:16.626 --> 28:17.528
Uh!

28:39.982 --> 28:41.015
Huh.

28:57.534 --> 28:59.604
Oh! Uh!

29:01.771 --> 29:05.073
Yes, I might've known Piggot-Dunceby
would send one of his rabid mutts

29:05.075 --> 29:06.811
to do his dirty work.

29:09.813 --> 29:11.979
No hard feelings, Frost.

29:11.981 --> 29:13.215
- Hyah!
- Aah!

29:13.217 --> 29:15.182
Except that one.

29:17.954 --> 29:20.287
Do you think you have things
in hand, Mr. Link?

29:20.289 --> 29:22.425
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

29:27.964 --> 29:29.765
Oh, no, you don't.

29:44.882 --> 29:45.816
Ooh!

29:49.385 --> 29:51.555
Sorry, old girl.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.525
Oh, blast.

29:56.527 --> 29:57.995
Aah!

29:59.430 --> 30:02.497
Oh, boy. That is gonna let in
an awful draft.

30:02.499 --> 30:05.199
Not to worry, Mr. Link.
We're not stopping after all.

30:05.201 --> 30:09.738
It seems Piggot-Dunceby is set on
scuppering my success at any cost.

30:09.740 --> 30:13.644
We must make haste
for Santa Ana, California.

30:15.546 --> 30:17.144
Lord Piggot-Dunceby!

30:17.146 --> 30:19.346
Lord Piggot-Dunceby,
a telegram!

30:19.348 --> 30:20.784
You have a telegra...

30:21.518 --> 30:23.086
It's from Stenk.

30:25.422 --> 30:28.123
No. It can't be true.

30:28.125 --> 30:31.360
- No... Mm.
- No one must know of this, do you hear?

30:31.362 --> 30:33.494
- We must redouble our efforts.
- Yeah.

30:33.496 --> 30:36.030
- Frost must not succeed!
- Eh?

30:36.032 --> 30:39.433
Get word to Stenk, and...
and tell him to stay on their trail.

30:39.435 --> 30:41.303
- Right.
- To the end of the world if he has to.

30:41.305 --> 30:43.908
Do you hear me?
The end of the world!

30:47.644 --> 30:50.111
Very good, Collick.
Run along now.

30:50.113 --> 30:53.114
Running along, yes, running along.

30:53.116 --> 30:54.716
<i>Just running along.</i>

30:54.718 --> 30:55.753
Hmm.

30:58.756 --> 31:00.391
All aboard!

31:05.461 --> 31:07.828
So, how did
Mr. Fortnight die, exactly?

31:07.830 --> 31:10.833
Buried by an avalanche
on the Hindu Kush.

31:10.835 --> 31:12.736
- Didn't know what hit him.
- Ow!

31:13.369 --> 31:15.003
I'm gonna say it was the snow
that hit him.

31:15.005 --> 31:17.572
He never completed his quest.
Died in the trying.

31:18.942 --> 31:21.642
This feels very confined.

31:21.644 --> 31:23.443
I feel woozy.
Do I look pale? I feel pale.

31:23.445 --> 31:26.414
Oh, stop fidgeting, Mr. Link.
You mustn't draw attention to yourself.

31:26.416 --> 31:28.682
Well, I'm not very
comfortable stealing a man's clothes.

31:28.684 --> 31:30.451
Well, you can't very well
walk around naked.

31:30.453 --> 31:31.853
It's indecent.

31:31.855 --> 31:34.488
Yeah, but... I mean,
his underwear, too?

31:34.490 --> 31:36.424
It just seems a little...

31:36.426 --> 31:38.293
I mean, I turned them
inside-out and all, but...

31:38.295 --> 31:40.594
Is it hot in here?
I think I need some air.

31:40.596 --> 31:43.498
Fine, fine. By all means,
crack open the win...

31:43.500 --> 31:46.168
...dow.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.635
Oh, that's better.

31:58.414 --> 31:59.948
<i>This way, please.</i>

31:59.950 --> 32:02.315
Señora doesn't normally
see guests.

32:02.317 --> 32:05.754
Yeah. I'm the same way.
Probably because my cave smells like sh...

32:05.756 --> 32:07.992
Should you perhaps wait here?

32:08.758 --> 32:11.061
Try not to shed
on the cashmere.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.066
Do you shed?

32:19.068 --> 32:20.969
<i>So,
let me see if I understand.</i>

32:20.971 --> 32:25.907
You plan to travel all the way
around the world to the Himalayas,

32:25.909 --> 32:29.344
looking for this, uh,
legendary creature.

32:29.346 --> 32:31.112
And to do this,
you need the map

32:31.114 --> 32:34.548
that my dearest husband
was holding in his hand

32:34.550 --> 32:36.919
when they pulled
his poor, dead body

32:36.921 --> 32:39.321
out of the ice that killed him
on the mountain.

32:39.323 --> 32:40.891
Yes, that's right.

32:42.259 --> 32:46.029
Is this... everything that
you are here to say to me?

32:47.396 --> 32:49.029
Did I leave something out?

32:49.031 --> 32:50.733
He was your friend.

32:51.434 --> 32:53.969
Oh, absolutely.
Like a brother to me.

32:53.971 --> 32:56.837
And you did not even go
to his funeral.

32:56.839 --> 32:59.507
Yes, well, goodbyes
are so tricky.

32:59.509 --> 33:02.678
You and Aldous...
what happened to you?

33:02.680 --> 33:06.648
Oh, come, now, Adelina.
I think you know the answer to that.

33:06.650 --> 33:08.717
It was over
between us, Lionel.

33:08.719 --> 33:11.652
And Aldous was there for me
in ways you never were.

33:11.654 --> 33:13.488
Yes, how fortunate
for you both.

33:13.490 --> 33:16.026
Ugh! I can't even look at you
right now.

33:18.394 --> 33:20.527
- There.
- There?

33:20.529 --> 33:22.830
There, there, Adelina.

33:22.832 --> 33:26.237
There's no need to get upset.
Such a sensitive creature.

33:26.604 --> 33:30.538
It saddens me to see you
shut away in this old house,

33:30.540 --> 33:33.442
surrounded by memories
of times long past.

33:33.876 --> 33:38.147
Like a... Like an unhappy bird
locked in a cage.

33:41.684 --> 33:43.017
You were always such a...

33:43.019 --> 33:46.955
such a vibrant, spirited,
intoxicating woman.

33:46.957 --> 33:47.721
- Stop!
- Ow!

33:47.723 --> 33:49.724
What is wrong with you?

33:49.726 --> 33:51.593
You think I cannot see?

33:51.595 --> 33:53.394
You come here
because you want something,

33:53.396 --> 33:56.363
and you think you can charm me
and you can flatter me

33:56.365 --> 33:58.099
and I will do just as you say.

33:58.101 --> 34:00.302
Um... yes.

34:00.304 --> 34:02.036
- No!
- No.

34:02.038 --> 34:03.705
So, could we go
through it again?

34:03.707 --> 34:05.841
Same old Lionel.

34:05.843 --> 34:09.476
Eyes only for your legend,
for Lionel's prize.

34:09.478 --> 34:11.780
You will get out of my house.

34:11.782 --> 34:13.947
Adelina,
you have me all wrong.

34:13.949 --> 34:17.083
I... I see how much your
husband's legacy means to you.

34:17.085 --> 34:19.186
I would never wish
to obtain the map

34:19.188 --> 34:21.356
by insincere flimflammery.

34:21.358 --> 34:23.824
No. I will pay you for it.

34:28.097 --> 34:29.030
<i>Get out!</i>

34:29.032 --> 34:30.264
Come along, Mr. Link.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.434
- <i>Salga de mi casa!</i>
- Um...

34:33.436 --> 34:36.003
<i>Fuera! Fuera de mi casa!</i>

34:36.005 --> 34:37.074
<i>Váyase!</i>

34:43.179 --> 34:45.445
We aren't
gonna break in, are we?

34:45.447 --> 34:47.114
I mean,
that's against the law.

34:47.117 --> 34:50.018
Oh, please, Mr. Link.
This is America.

34:50.621 --> 34:51.822
Put this on.

34:55.925 --> 34:57.891
Hey, Sir Lionel. Sorry.

34:57.893 --> 34:59.896
Do you have a size bigger?

35:00.697 --> 35:02.863
I think I put a run in it.

35:02.865 --> 35:05.499
On your head. It's a disguise.

35:05.501 --> 35:07.202
We're not here
to perform burlesque.

35:07.204 --> 35:09.873
Look, just forget
about the stocking.

35:15.010 --> 35:17.614
Here. Now throw this rope
over the wall.

35:22.385 --> 35:24.054
What... What did you just do?

35:24.454 --> 35:27.220
Uh, what do you mean?
I threw the rope over the wall.

35:27.222 --> 35:28.590
I didn't mean all of it.

35:28.592 --> 35:30.458
Well, you never said that.
I'm very literal.

35:30.460 --> 35:32.459
- Oh, you don't say?
- No, I do say.

35:32.461 --> 35:34.795
I just said that right then.
Aren't you listening?

35:34.797 --> 35:36.463
Now what are
we gonna do?

35:36.465 --> 35:38.766
You said throw the rope over,
so I threw the rope over.

35:38.768 --> 35:40.802
Why don't you just
throw this over as well?

35:40.804 --> 35:42.306
Okay.

35:43.172 --> 35:45.041
Oh.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.681
Okay, never mind.

35:51.114 --> 35:53.282
You'll have to climb the wall
and pull me up.

35:53.817 --> 35:55.383
Okay, I'm not very good
at climbing.

35:55.385 --> 35:58.122
Oh, for pity's sake. Of course you are.
Look at your arms.

36:00.322 --> 36:02.091
Hmm. That's a good point.

36:02.492 --> 36:03.760
That's a good point.

36:04.427 --> 36:05.329
Okay.

36:17.172 --> 36:18.639
Mm-hmm.

36:22.713 --> 36:24.715
Ah...

36:32.688 --> 36:34.791
Aah! No! Ooh! Aah!

36:39.461 --> 36:40.728
Bravo.

36:40.730 --> 36:42.262
Thank you.

36:49.338 --> 36:50.838
Oh, do hurry up.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.106
You're making too much noise.

36:56.746 --> 36:58.749
Aah! Ow!

36:59.282 --> 37:00.248
Oh, sorry.

37:08.824 --> 37:10.958
- Ow.
- Do you think you can lift it?

37:10.960 --> 37:13.561
- I guess so.
- Then get it over to the window

37:13.563 --> 37:15.295
and throw it out
into the bushes.

37:15.297 --> 37:17.000
I'll keep watch.

37:39.289 --> 37:41.124
What are you doing?

37:41.590 --> 37:42.757
Just one second, please.

37:44.327 --> 37:45.760
Almost there.

37:45.762 --> 37:47.461
Stop it.

37:47.463 --> 37:48.464
Stop it.

37:49.032 --> 37:51.365
- Is there a problem?
- Why don't you just play a trumpet

37:51.367 --> 37:53.566
and sing "The Star-Spangled
Banner" while you're at it?

37:53.568 --> 37:56.005
I could give it a try.
Oh, but I don't have a trumpet.

37:56.373 --> 37:58.005
And I don't know
that song that well.

37:58.007 --> 37:59.641
Wait. You don't want me
to do that.

37:59.643 --> 38:02.043
I'm on to you, mister.
I am on to you.

38:02.045 --> 38:03.480
I knew it!

38:04.014 --> 38:06.950
- You terrible thieves!
- A fair assessment.

38:07.351 --> 38:08.749
Oh!

38:13.489 --> 38:15.458
<i>Lionel!</i>

38:18.228 --> 38:19.963
Yes!

38:44.853 --> 38:46.987
Lionel Frost!

38:46.989 --> 38:48.423
I know this is you in there.

38:48.425 --> 38:49.523
Ooh!

38:49.525 --> 38:51.758
I do not even want to know
how you got this.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.461
There was a nun.
We mugged her.

38:53.463 --> 38:56.065
Oh, my dear.
I think you've made a mistake.

38:56.766 --> 38:58.032
You're right, it's me.

38:58.034 --> 38:59.967
How could you tell?

39:08.277 --> 39:11.813
Give me back my husband's map.

39:11.815 --> 39:13.012
Adelina, I think...

39:13.014 --> 39:15.284
Huh?

39:17.987 --> 39:20.757
Someone is shooting at you,
and it isn't me.

39:21.157 --> 39:23.927
Did you steal from him
as well?

39:29.398 --> 39:30.731
Oh...

39:30.733 --> 39:31.902
Aah!

39:36.840 --> 39:38.972
We really don't have time
for this.

39:38.974 --> 39:40.541
I mean to get
to the Himalayas,

39:40.543 --> 39:42.709
- and I need your map to do it.
- Not so fast.

39:42.711 --> 39:45.612
Please, Adelina. What possible
need could you have for this?

39:45.614 --> 39:46.981
Something you said to me.

39:46.983 --> 39:49.483
It is time
for this unhappy bird...

39:50.887 --> 39:53.921
...to break out of her cage.

39:53.923 --> 39:57.624
- Adelina?
- That's right, Sir Lionel Frost.

39:57.626 --> 39:58.958
And your big, hairy f...

39:58.960 --> 40:01.394
- I'm sorry. Who's this?
- I'll explain later.

40:01.396 --> 40:03.764
Oh, I don't care.
The point is, I'm coming with you.

40:05.235 --> 40:07.133
I don't really have a say
in the matter, do I?

40:07.135 --> 40:09.472
- <i>Para nada.</i>
- All right, fine.

40:10.206 --> 40:12.873
Quickly!
We must climb aboard!

40:12.875 --> 40:15.012
- Huh?
- The train is leaving!

40:16.846 --> 40:17.947
Oh!

40:18.914 --> 40:20.447
What? We will miss it.

40:20.449 --> 40:23.352
Change of plan. We must give
this villain the slip.

40:23.954 --> 40:25.622
Oh, no, you don't.

40:27.523 --> 40:30.691
Follow me. We must find
an alternative route.

40:30.693 --> 40:32.028
No time to dawdle.

40:45.141 --> 40:47.907
Hyah! Hyah!

40:47.909 --> 40:50.043
<i>From New York,
we can find passage to London</i>

40:50.045 --> 40:53.213
<i>and easily navigate the
European continent by rail.</i>

40:53.215 --> 40:55.483
On through India,
and from there,

40:55.485 --> 40:58.586
it's just a tidy step to the
foothills of the Himalayas

40:58.588 --> 41:01.923
and our ultimate destination:
Shangri-La.

41:01.925 --> 41:04.858
Shangri-La? No!

41:04.860 --> 41:08.662
I can't believe it!
Oh, my goodness! This sounds...

41:08.664 --> 41:11.264
Oh, my goodness!
That is great!

41:11.266 --> 41:13.501
This can't be happ...

41:13.503 --> 41:15.038
What is that, exactly?

41:15.905 --> 41:18.539
Is it a... Is it a place?

41:19.943 --> 41:22.476
It has been called many names:

41:22.478 --> 41:24.677
Shambhala, Agartha,

41:24.679 --> 41:26.246
the Valley of the Blue Moon.

41:26.248 --> 41:30.553
Legend says it is a place
of uncommon beauty.

41:31.121 --> 41:34.722
An earthly Eden
where man never grows old.

41:34.724 --> 41:37.090
Actually, Aldous believed

41:37.092 --> 41:38.925
that this story
was not quite right.

41:38.927 --> 41:42.796
He believed that the valley was not
the home of men who had never aged,

41:42.798 --> 41:46.036
but of men
who had never evolved.

41:46.436 --> 41:48.001
Early man.

41:48.003 --> 41:50.606
- Like me?
- Like you.

41:51.541 --> 41:53.474
Yes. Yes, that's right.

41:53.476 --> 41:56.610
An undiscovered
civilization of yetis,

41:56.612 --> 42:00.347
living and flourishing
in isolation.

42:00.349 --> 42:04.318
Quite a tall tale, but I think
he was on to something.

42:04.320 --> 42:07.755
And I will follow
in his footsteps

42:07.757 --> 42:09.389
all the way to the prize.

42:09.391 --> 42:12.860
But I don't see a
path to Shangri-La on this map.

42:12.862 --> 42:15.697
Just directions to Gamu?
What's that?

42:15.699 --> 42:17.798
Not what, but who.

42:17.800 --> 42:21.434
The exact location of the
mythical valley was thought lost,

42:21.436 --> 42:23.371
- but Aldous learned...
- Aldous, Aldous.

42:23.373 --> 42:25.305
- Excuse me, it's my turn.
- Carry on.

42:25.307 --> 42:27.541
Aldous learned of
a mountain guide named Gamu

42:27.543 --> 42:29.976
who knew the secret ways
through the mountains.

42:29.978 --> 42:33.180
Aldous believed
if we find Shangri-La,

42:33.182 --> 42:35.148
we find the yeti.

42:35.150 --> 42:37.751
Yes, and then, Mr. Link,

42:37.753 --> 42:41.487
you will at last be united
with your lost brethren.

42:41.489 --> 42:45.059
I'm a quiet guy at heart,

42:45.061 --> 42:47.161
but do you mind
if I just kind of...

42:47.163 --> 42:49.662
growl a little bit
in excitement?

42:56.472 --> 42:57.905
<i>That was fun.</i>

42:57.907 --> 43:00.809
<i>Yes, let's not
get overexcited, shall we?</i>

43:01.277 --> 43:04.677
You know, I really
didn't think it was possible.

43:04.679 --> 43:08.615
And yet here you are
in front of my face.

43:08.617 --> 43:10.450
I cannot believe it.

43:11.588 --> 43:14.624
All these years,
my husband searched for this.

43:15.657 --> 43:17.157
I wish...

43:17.159 --> 43:19.260
I wish he could have
been here to see it.

43:19.262 --> 43:21.264
Hmm. Poor Adelina.

43:21.697 --> 43:23.831
That does not mean
I'm happy about you.

43:23.833 --> 43:27.534
That is really rather
unreasonable, I must say.

43:31.574 --> 43:33.273
You know what?
I'm gonna just be over here.

43:33.275 --> 43:35.208
I'm gonna stare out the window
for a long time.

43:38.047 --> 43:39.415
Uh!

43:43.318 --> 43:46.320
Oh, my word. Look at...
What is that, the sky?

43:46.322 --> 43:49.624
Hyah! Hyah!

44:11.947 --> 44:15.382
- Oh, do hurry it up.
- Be patient.

44:15.384 --> 44:17.751
Can't you see poor Mr. Link
is nervous?

44:17.753 --> 44:21.722
Oh, believe me, he's got a lot more to
worry about than boarding this boat.

44:21.724 --> 44:23.557
What do you mean?

44:23.559 --> 44:25.559
Oh, Adelina.

44:25.561 --> 44:28.329
Let me say this very clearly.

44:28.331 --> 44:30.498
The hunter that follows us

44:30.500 --> 44:33.633
will not give up the chase easily.
You understand?

44:33.635 --> 44:36.237
He's still on our tail.
Have no doubt.

44:36.239 --> 44:39.340
If he catches us,
he will shoot you dead, skin you,

44:39.342 --> 44:41.342
and have your pelt
as his hearthrug.

44:41.344 --> 44:44.077
And if that happens,
well, then...

44:44.079 --> 44:47.248
I mean, I have...
I'll have no chance of winning my wager.

44:47.250 --> 44:49.349
Lionel!

44:49.351 --> 44:51.487
<i>Dios mío.</i>

45:06.936 --> 45:10.204
Stenk followed them on board
a cargo steamer bound for London.

45:10.206 --> 45:12.974
He says he'll deliver them
to you, dot-dot-dot,

45:12.976 --> 45:15.374
dead or alive,
exclamation mark.

45:15.376 --> 45:18.545
Hire thugs.
Bribe the port authorities.

45:18.547 --> 45:21.347
As soon as that ship
reaches dry land,

45:21.349 --> 45:23.249
we'll be waiting for them.

45:31.059 --> 45:32.793
Hmm.

45:41.237 --> 45:43.373
Come in.

45:44.673 --> 45:46.807
<i>Qué es lo que quiere
éste ahora?</i>

45:46.809 --> 45:49.012
What do you say
to a peace offering?

45:52.347 --> 45:54.483
Eh. I don't mind if I do.

45:55.719 --> 45:59.019
Hmm. Yes, I thought perhaps
we might clear the air.

45:59.021 --> 46:00.487
My air?

46:00.489 --> 46:03.523
No, no, no.
My air is clear.

46:03.525 --> 46:07.628
But Mr. Link? I think perhaps
his air is all stuffed up.

46:07.630 --> 46:10.331
He thinks so highly
of you, Lionel.

46:10.333 --> 46:11.833
He really believes in you.

46:11.835 --> 46:14.834
And yet you treat him so poorly.

46:14.836 --> 46:18.039
Name one time that
I've ever treated him poorly.

46:18.041 --> 46:19.574
You poke him with your stick.

46:19.576 --> 46:21.874
You make him carry your bag
like he's your servant.

46:21.876 --> 46:25.045
- You tell him he smells of wet dog.
- Yes, I said name one.

46:25.047 --> 46:28.182
You put yourself first
and always Mr. Link second.

46:28.184 --> 46:30.019
Adelina,
that's simply not true.

46:30.487 --> 46:32.588
Is that really
what you think of me?

46:33.021 --> 46:34.356
Yes.

46:34.923 --> 46:36.358
Oh, now, steady on...

46:40.262 --> 46:42.632
You do not seem
so steady yourself.

46:43.199 --> 46:45.298
Perhaps it is time
you made a step

46:45.300 --> 46:47.603
in a different direction.

46:51.807 --> 46:54.376
I haven't the faintest idea
of what you're talking about.

46:57.246 --> 46:58.381
Hmm?

47:03.820 --> 47:05.452
Look at him.

47:05.454 --> 47:09.389
His hope rests
in your hand, Lionel.

47:09.391 --> 47:10.926
Talk to him.

47:12.929 --> 47:13.894
Can't you do it?

47:13.896 --> 47:16.398
Go now,
or I'll throw you overboard.

47:16.831 --> 47:17.766
Go.

47:35.117 --> 47:37.653
Oh. Sir Lionel. I, uh...

47:38.153 --> 47:39.856
was just getting
some fresh air.

47:42.023 --> 47:44.358
Uh... you seem, um,

47:44.360 --> 47:46.096
you seem troubled, Mr. Link.

47:47.929 --> 47:50.363
Sir Lionel, have you ever
wanted something so bad

47:50.365 --> 47:54.436
it hurt inside,
like gas, but sadder?

47:55.438 --> 47:58.807
Hmm. Well... yes.

47:59.541 --> 48:01.478
As a matter of fact, I have.

48:02.612 --> 48:05.148
As long as
I can remember, I...

48:06.349 --> 48:08.849
I wished to become
a great adventurer,

48:08.851 --> 48:11.320
respected throughout
the Empire.

48:12.088 --> 48:14.691
Well, it hasn't quite
worked out that way.

48:15.657 --> 48:16.791
Not yet.

48:16.793 --> 48:18.092
But someday.

48:18.094 --> 48:22.429
Yes, someday people
will remember my deeds

48:22.431 --> 48:24.699
and know my name.

48:24.701 --> 48:26.400
Of course they will.

48:26.402 --> 48:28.501
Your name is gonna
go down in history

48:28.503 --> 48:30.369
as the world's
greatest adventurer.

48:30.371 --> 48:33.509
Now,
not the greatest, surely.

48:35.643 --> 48:37.945
At least you have a name.

48:37.947 --> 48:39.479
One of your own, I mean.

48:39.481 --> 48:41.717
I don't think
"Mr. Link" really counts.

48:42.550 --> 48:45.922
Well, then...
perhaps we might remedy that.

48:47.389 --> 48:50.389
- What do you mean?
- You must choose a name.

48:50.391 --> 48:54.195
Um, a name that has
special meaning to you.

48:54.197 --> 48:55.297
Yes, perhaps...

48:55.864 --> 48:57.697
perhaps the name
of someone in your life

48:57.699 --> 49:00.501
who touched you... here.

49:00.503 --> 49:01.601
My nipple?

49:01.603 --> 49:03.470
Heart. Your heart.

49:03.472 --> 49:04.941
Oh. Yeah.

49:07.309 --> 49:09.677
Well, some years back,

49:09.679 --> 49:12.880
there was a young prospector
who came to live in the woods

49:12.882 --> 49:15.550
to try their luck
on the high mountain rivers.

49:16.351 --> 49:18.151
One day, they came
close to my cave,

49:18.153 --> 49:20.054
while out picking berries.

49:20.056 --> 49:23.226
And they saw me,
and they were just standing there.

49:23.826 --> 49:25.458
And when I looked at them,

49:25.460 --> 49:28.662
they didn't scream, didn't turn
and run away like most people do.

49:28.664 --> 49:31.934
They just... They just smiled.

49:32.335 --> 49:35.637
And that smile
meant the world to me.

49:36.038 --> 49:37.104
Perfect.

49:37.106 --> 49:39.876
And... And what was
the prospector's name?

49:40.842 --> 49:41.844
Susan.

49:43.012 --> 49:44.478
Su... Susan?

49:44.480 --> 49:47.447
Yeah, Susan.
That should be my name.

49:47.449 --> 49:49.416
So, this prospector
was a girl?

49:49.418 --> 49:50.818
Yes, that's correct.

49:50.820 --> 49:53.556
Well, then
that is a girl's name.

49:54.255 --> 49:55.257
Uh-huh.

49:56.626 --> 49:58.358
Well, yes, I...

49:58.360 --> 50:00.929
Um... it suits you.

50:01.630 --> 50:03.430
And now...

50:03.432 --> 50:05.097
Now we must rest.

50:05.099 --> 50:08.601
We have a long way to go,
but I assure you,

50:08.603 --> 50:10.470
we will reach the Himalayas

50:10.472 --> 50:14.307
and find this lost civilization of
yetis, this Shangri-La.

50:14.309 --> 50:17.180
We will find your place.

50:21.016 --> 50:22.217
Good night, uh...

50:22.885 --> 50:23.920
Susan.

50:28.322 --> 50:29.291
Susan.

50:35.496 --> 50:40.636
Wow, that was positively
altruistic, if I do say so myself.

50:41.436 --> 50:42.970
Adelina? What's wrong?

50:42.972 --> 50:45.671
What, are you lost for words?

50:45.673 --> 50:48.275
Stenk! Leave her alone.

50:48.277 --> 50:50.443
- Your fight is with me.
- Mm-hmm.

50:50.445 --> 50:52.781
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

50:53.181 --> 50:55.648
- Huh?
- Whoa. No.

50:55.650 --> 50:56.952
Give me...

50:59.655 --> 51:01.889
<i>Aah!
Quit yankin' on my shooter!</i>

51:01.891 --> 51:04.324
<i>Lionel, look out!
Get your hands off of him!</i>

51:04.326 --> 51:05.226
<i>Get off of me!</i>

51:13.702 --> 51:16.706
Hey, you! Don't you touch him!

51:18.072 --> 51:19.208
Oh!

51:26.282 --> 51:28.585
Help me!

51:31.987 --> 51:33.552
I got you now.

51:40.362 --> 51:43.630
MR. - I can't reach!

51:43.632 --> 51:45.932
The life buoy! The life buoy!

51:45.934 --> 51:48.367
- Throw the life buoy!
- Okay.

51:48.369 --> 51:50.072
Uh... Aha!

52:15.963 --> 52:17.264
Wha...

52:17.266 --> 52:18.300
Aah!

52:18.768 --> 52:20.800
That's a little bit
below the belt, isn't it?

52:20.802 --> 52:22.304
What?

52:25.807 --> 52:27.976
Oh God. Okay...

52:33.048 --> 52:34.217
I've got ya!

52:34.849 --> 52:36.885
Over here!

52:39.188 --> 52:41.224
Help!

52:43.724 --> 52:45.391
Could you hold on a second?

52:45.393 --> 52:46.760
I am!

52:48.664 --> 52:50.199
I'm here!

53:06.081 --> 53:08.048
Oh!

53:35.277 --> 53:36.713
Yah!

53:37.313 --> 53:38.381
Aah!

53:52.327 --> 53:53.795
Huh?

53:54.730 --> 53:56.630
A monster!

53:56.632 --> 53:59.099
And he's got
a defenseless girl!

53:59.101 --> 54:00.967
- Monster?
- Defenseless?

54:00.969 --> 54:02.838
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

54:12.248 --> 54:14.916
This way!

54:16.219 --> 54:20.287
Oh, and-and, Mr. Link,
keep your trousers on, please.

54:20.289 --> 54:21.457
There's a good chap.

54:27.028 --> 54:30.764
Aw, shoot. The boss
ain't gonna like this.

54:43.311 --> 54:45.914
Are you positive
about this, Mr. Stenk?

54:46.481 --> 54:49.249
Oh, yeah. A whole lost world
is what he said.

54:49.251 --> 54:52.485
Big-footed critters
as far as the eye can see.

54:52.487 --> 54:55.023
No!

54:55.856 --> 54:58.557
I won't stand for it.

54:58.559 --> 55:00.793
It's a mockery of man!

55:00.795 --> 55:03.396
A sham of civilized society!

55:04.699 --> 55:10.272
I'll run this game to ground
if it's the last thing I do.

55:12.373 --> 55:14.943
All things considered,
I think he took that quite well.

55:15.543 --> 55:18.878
Come along, Mr. Link.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.380
We're one step ahead
of our adversaries,

55:20.382 --> 55:22.416
so let's keep it that way.

55:22.418 --> 55:26.255
And, uh, well,
we can enjoy the view while we're about.

55:29.358 --> 55:32.295
Uh,
are we gonna need the boat again?

56:27.449 --> 56:31.550
There's so many
beautiful things in the world.

56:31.552 --> 56:33.121
Yes.

56:36.559 --> 56:38.992
Oh, Lionel, look.

56:38.994 --> 56:41.430
Oh, remarkable.

56:41.931 --> 56:44.998
This is just like old times,
wouldn't you say?

56:45.000 --> 56:46.034
Hmm, yes.

56:46.601 --> 56:50.269
Yes, uh... although
the Sasquatch is new.

56:53.942 --> 56:56.742
Aw, he's all tuckered out.

56:58.213 --> 56:59.945
He's come a long way.

56:59.947 --> 57:02.451
I think we all have.

57:12.827 --> 57:15.163
Oh!

57:15.931 --> 57:17.264
Good morning.

57:17.266 --> 57:19.633
- Mm-mm-mm.
- Oh, Lionel.

57:19.635 --> 57:21.633
I say, old chap,
could you loosen your grip?

57:21.635 --> 57:23.438
My, uh, arms have gone dead.

57:24.106 --> 57:26.738
So, what's going on?
Are we nearly there yet?

57:26.740 --> 57:28.208
Almost, Susan, almost.

57:28.210 --> 57:30.711
We'll soon have you
frolicking in the snow

57:30.713 --> 57:34.014
with huge, hairy ape-men.
Just you wait and see.

57:34.016 --> 57:36.619
Oh, boy.
A guy could dream.

57:59.807 --> 58:01.443
Yes, this is it.

58:02.210 --> 58:04.246
But, Lionel...

58:06.614 --> 58:08.180
where do we go from here?

58:08.182 --> 58:10.050
From here, my dear,
we shall rely

58:10.052 --> 58:12.184
on my extensive
anthropological knowledge

58:12.186 --> 58:15.223
and my keen eye
for local custom.

58:16.858 --> 58:19.092
Do you understand English?

58:19.094 --> 58:22.461
Yes. Hello? Hello?
Excuse me, sir.

58:22.463 --> 58:27.735
Would you
please direct us to Gamu?

58:28.137 --> 58:29.436
Do you understand?

58:29.438 --> 58:32.104
Ga... mu?

58:32.106 --> 58:34.710
The Englishman abroad.

58:35.510 --> 58:36.677
Nyah.

58:36.679 --> 58:38.045
Well, that's a little bit rude.

58:38.047 --> 58:39.746
I said it's rude!

58:39.748 --> 58:43.450
Heh. We are walking untrodden paths
through the Himalayas, Mr. Link.

58:43.452 --> 58:45.619
This is merely
a local greeting.

58:45.621 --> 58:46.588
Oh.

58:47.188 --> 58:48.755
Pleased to meet you!

58:49.824 --> 58:50.859
Take care.

58:57.099 --> 58:58.731
You seek Gamu?

58:58.733 --> 59:00.133
She's my grandmother.

59:00.135 --> 59:01.570
I will take you to her.

59:06.242 --> 59:09.309
I must warn you,
she does not like visitors,

59:09.311 --> 59:13.012
'cause she is old and rude
and prefers solitude.

59:13.014 --> 59:14.715
Moo.

59:16.251 --> 59:20.119
Also, please do not,
whatever you do,

59:20.121 --> 59:22.755
mention the...
Chicken.

59:22.757 --> 59:24.858
- The chicken?
- Yes, please.

59:24.860 --> 59:26.793
Never, ever mention
the chicken.

59:26.795 --> 59:28.226
- Of course not.
- We understand.

59:28.228 --> 59:30.198
No chicken, got it. Zip.

59:42.478 --> 59:44.711
Uh, greetings, venerable Gamu.

59:44.713 --> 59:47.414
- It is an honor.
- What's with the chicken?

59:47.416 --> 59:49.215
What is he talking about?

59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.197
Hmm, she says
you must join her for supper.

01:00:23.918 --> 01:00:25.150
I'm sorry, what is this?

01:00:25.152 --> 01:00:26.955
Yak stew.

01:00:27.389 --> 01:00:28.889
Oh, no, thanks.
I don't eat meat.

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:31.090
I mean, I do eat bacon
and squirrel and chicken.

01:00:31.092 --> 01:00:32.626
No, not chicken.
I eat fish. I said fish.

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:36.132
We mustn't insult our host,
Mr. Link. Eat it.

01:00:43.405 --> 01:00:45.738
Mmm. It's delicious.

01:00:53.882 --> 01:00:55.548
Mmm.

01:00:57.452 --> 01:00:58.487
Gamu...

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:01.390
perhaps we can try
some of your tea.

01:01:05.293 --> 01:01:07.896
It is made from yak butter.

01:01:08.396 --> 01:01:10.764
Um, do you have anything
that doesn't come from a yak?

01:01:10.766 --> 01:01:12.565
Yak is our life.

01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:16.269
Yak is milk, meat,
clothes, friend.

01:01:16.271 --> 01:01:18.371
Unusual bouquet.

01:01:18.373 --> 01:01:20.206
And it smells funny, too.

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:23.108
- Oh, that is not the tea.
- No? What is it?

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:26.414
Dung. We burn it for fuel.

01:01:27.615 --> 01:01:28.981
Yak?

01:01:28.983 --> 01:01:30.215
Yak, of course.

01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:35.824
Cookie?

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:39.925
I really shouldn't be having
one of these,

01:01:39.927 --> 01:01:43.298
but, oh, they're so good.

01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:46.434
Mmm!

01:01:47.601 --> 01:01:50.302
Gamu, if I may,

01:01:50.304 --> 01:01:52.639
we have traveled
many thousands of miles

01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:55.108
to find a place
lost in the mountains,

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:57.646
a place I think you know.

01:01:58.079 --> 01:02:01.149
Some call it... Shangri-La.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:05.150
This place you seek
is not lost.

01:02:05.152 --> 01:02:08.756
It is hidden,
hidden by choice.

01:02:09.324 --> 01:02:14.394
Perhaps it is the men
who seek it who are lost.

01:02:14.396 --> 01:02:16.095
Then you know of it?

01:02:16.097 --> 01:02:18.697
Yes, I do.

01:02:18.699 --> 01:02:22.068
And I know
it is not a place for man.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:24.403
It is not a place for you.

01:02:24.405 --> 01:02:25.641
No.

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:28.974
It's for me.

01:02:31.179 --> 01:02:33.512
- Um...
- You have killed my grandmother!

01:02:33.514 --> 01:02:35.717
Quick, quick, quick!
Someone should give her the kiss of life!

01:02:38.385 --> 01:02:39.922
You're the man for the job.

01:02:40.922 --> 01:02:42.054
How's my breath?

01:02:52.266 --> 01:02:55.570
<i>You killed her again!</i>

01:02:57.204 --> 01:02:59.373
I was mistaken.

01:02:59.773 --> 01:03:04.177
You are right to take him
to his kind, where he belongs.

01:03:04.179 --> 01:03:05.646
Then you will guide us?

01:03:06.014 --> 01:03:08.347
You got to be kidding.

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:11.617
I will give
my granddaughter directions.

01:03:56.398 --> 01:03:58.264
<i>Go! Get out!</i>

01:03:58.266 --> 01:03:59.833
<i>Get out of my house!</i>

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:01.467
<i>I asked you nicely,</i>

01:04:01.469 --> 01:04:04.135
but I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:04:04.137 --> 01:04:06.206
Tell us what you told them!

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:10.976
Oh, Mr. Stenk,
you're doing this all wrong.

01:04:10.978 --> 01:04:14.750
You mustn't threaten
the defenseless old woman.

01:04:15.449 --> 01:04:16.816
How about the chicken?

01:04:16.818 --> 01:04:18.550
What chicken?

01:04:18.552 --> 01:04:22.488
No! You must threaten her
defenseless grandson instead.

01:05:04.998 --> 01:05:06.401
Over here!

01:05:22.384 --> 01:05:23.485
Oh!

01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:29.755
Ow!

01:05:34.228 --> 01:05:35.193
Oh!

01:05:35.195 --> 01:05:36.563
Aah!

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.081
Oh! Brother.

01:07:23.637 --> 01:07:26.875
Who is it
that comes before us?

01:07:27.342 --> 01:07:28.777
Sir Lionel Frost.

01:07:29.143 --> 01:07:33.112
And if I might ask, how the devil
can you speak English so well?

01:07:33.114 --> 01:07:35.548
How can you speak English
so well?

01:07:36.818 --> 01:07:39.184
Well, Eton, obviously.

01:07:39.186 --> 01:07:41.521
How do you know
I'm not speaking yeti?

01:07:41.523 --> 01:07:43.088
Because...

01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:45.258
Look, I'm not sure exactly
where this is taking us.

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.760
Is there anything wrong with
staying exactly where we are?

01:07:48.762 --> 01:07:50.396
Do you always speak
in questions?

01:07:50.398 --> 01:07:53.365
I don't know. Do I?

01:07:53.367 --> 01:07:54.900
I have a question for you.

01:07:54.902 --> 01:07:57.836
Why did you guide us here
at the tip of a spear?

01:07:57.838 --> 01:08:00.873
We do not wield weapons
to threaten, but to defend.

01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.708
That doesn't make them
any less sharp.

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:05.478
- You speak with some wisdom.
- I state the obvious.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.012
Often that is the same thing.

01:08:07.014 --> 01:08:08.914
Well, here is an absolute.

01:08:08.916 --> 01:08:11.885
We do not seek glory
or riches.

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:14.220
We're not here
to pillage your temple

01:08:14.222 --> 01:08:15.990
or disturb your tranquility.

01:08:16.557 --> 01:08:18.627
We want nothing from you.

01:08:19.193 --> 01:08:21.162
Then why are you here?

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.267
That is me. Sorry.

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:31.303
Oh, but of course.

01:08:31.305 --> 01:08:33.372
The country cousin.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:36.442
The... redneck.

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:37.977
Actually...

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:39.577
Sorry. Actually,
I'd say more...

01:08:39.578 --> 01:08:42.381
I think it's more...
I think it's more of a rust, isn't it?

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:45.350
People say red.
I find I'm more of an auburn.

01:08:45.353 --> 01:08:48.486
I have a lot of autumn in me,
a lot of autumn colors.

01:08:48.488 --> 01:08:51.256
Um, so, you know, we...

01:08:51.259 --> 01:08:55.426
Anyway, I figured maybe there was
a place for me here, among you.

01:08:55.429 --> 01:08:57.131
Come this way.

01:09:08.908 --> 01:09:11.611
So, this is it, Shangri-La.

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:13.011
Myth made real.

01:09:13.014 --> 01:09:17.118
Shangri-La?
That is not our name.

01:09:17.652 --> 01:09:19.218
We call it...

01:09:22.756 --> 01:09:25.256
How phlegmatic.
What does it mean?

01:09:25.259 --> 01:09:26.895
"Keep out. We hate you."

01:09:27.595 --> 01:09:30.898
This valley is unsullied,
precious.

01:09:31.497 --> 01:09:34.403
And so it shall remain.

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:39.604
There is no place
for you among us.

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:44.309
But you're my kind,
you're my fa... my family.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:47.515
No. I think not.

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:50.015
It seems to me,
you did not have to travel

01:09:50.018 --> 01:09:53.819
halfway around the world
to find your kind.

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:59.025
Man, killer of life,
of hope, of dreams.

01:09:59.027 --> 01:10:02.195
Man talks of the magic
of the world,

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:04.030
but it is a prize,

01:10:04.032 --> 01:10:06.932
something to be claimed
as proof of his worth.

01:10:06.934 --> 01:10:09.402
I mean, she has a point.

01:10:09.404 --> 01:10:14.374
These secrets you have seen,
they are ours, and ours alone.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:16.942
The outside world
must never learn the truths

01:10:16.944 --> 01:10:18.544
of our sacred valley.

01:10:18.546 --> 01:10:20.912
That is something
we cannot allow.

01:10:20.914 --> 01:10:22.580
She's gonna kill us!

01:10:22.582 --> 01:10:23.682
Kill you?

01:10:23.684 --> 01:10:26.384
We are not monsters.

01:10:26.386 --> 01:10:27.452
Oh!

01:10:27.454 --> 01:10:29.388
Oh, gosh.

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.357
For a minute there, I thought, just for
a second, that maybe you were going...

01:10:32.359 --> 01:10:34.760
Throw them into the
Inescapable Pit of Isolation

01:10:34.762 --> 01:10:36.696
and Miserable Disappointment.

01:10:36.698 --> 01:10:38.330
Oh. I'm sorry, what?

01:10:38.332 --> 01:10:41.500
There, you will spend
the rest of your lives

01:10:41.502 --> 01:10:43.535
pondering
your ill transgressions.

01:10:43.537 --> 01:10:44.836
You can't keep us here.

01:10:44.838 --> 01:10:46.738
It's barbaric!

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.777
It is preservation.

01:10:53.413 --> 01:10:55.416
You fiends!

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.856
Oh, this is awful.

01:11:36.323 --> 01:11:37.790
Yes.

01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:40.659
I'll be the laughingstock
of the club, again.

01:11:40.661 --> 01:11:42.896
<i>Yo no puedo creer.</i>

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:44.498
Look at him.

01:11:46.199 --> 01:11:47.434
Look!

01:11:49.871 --> 01:11:52.905
His dream is crushed, and you...

01:11:52.907 --> 01:11:54.909
you only talk of yourself.

01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:57.076
Well, what about my dreams?

01:11:57.078 --> 01:11:59.410
What?
To belong to that silly club?

01:11:59.412 --> 01:12:02.882
These men do not like you,
they do not respect you,

01:12:02.884 --> 01:12:05.353
they do not believe
the things that you believe.

01:12:05.819 --> 01:12:09.455
So, why? Why do you wish
to be one of them?

01:12:09.457 --> 01:12:10.892
Be... Because...

01:12:11.525 --> 01:12:13.528
Because they said I couldn't.

01:12:15.095 --> 01:12:17.729
You and Susan
are not different at all,

01:12:17.731 --> 01:12:20.601
wanting to belong
in all the wrong places.

01:12:22.036 --> 01:12:24.005
You could never understand.

01:12:26.974 --> 01:12:28.775
You know something, Lionel?

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:32.443
All this time, I'm thinking you care
more about these legends you chase

01:12:32.445 --> 01:12:35.313
than you do about people,
but I'm wrong.

01:12:35.315 --> 01:12:38.886
There's only one legend Sir
Lionel Frost really cares about.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.088
Is it a unicorn?

01:12:42.657 --> 01:12:45.759
Oh. Wait.
You mean me, don't you?

01:12:46.193 --> 01:12:49.260
You were never interested
in anyone but yourself.

01:12:49.262 --> 01:12:53.400
And yet, you are surprised
that you always end up alone.

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.670
You have me wrong.

01:12:56.037 --> 01:12:58.571
I am better
than you think I am.

01:12:58.573 --> 01:13:00.075
Prove it.

01:13:00.675 --> 01:13:05.044
You talk about proof,
but all you offer are words.

01:13:05.046 --> 01:13:07.545
Where is this great man,
Sir Lionel?

01:13:07.547 --> 01:13:11.286
Where is the proof of him?
Where is the proof of his worth?

01:13:12.253 --> 01:13:15.090
I think perhaps
the great Sir Lionel Frost...

01:13:15.855 --> 01:13:17.591
is a myth.

01:13:38.445 --> 01:13:41.179
It is time to
settle our debt, Susan.

01:13:41.181 --> 01:13:44.250
I promised I'd take you
to the place you belong,

01:13:44.252 --> 01:13:46.585
and I'm a man of my word.

01:13:46.587 --> 01:13:50.224
The Elder is right.
You don't belong here.

01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:53.360
Now, get up. We're leaving.

01:14:03.037 --> 01:14:05.941
Now, hold me tightly.

01:14:06.474 --> 01:14:08.072
Are you... Are you sure?

01:14:08.074 --> 01:14:09.509
Um, Adelina's watching.

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:12.744
What? No, no. I want you
to throw me out of the pit.

01:14:12.746 --> 01:14:15.981
Uh, I don't know.
I think you might be a little too heavy.

01:14:15.983 --> 01:14:18.483
Nonsense.
Now, give it all you've got.

01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:26.425
Oh. It's hard to know
whose fault that was.

01:14:26.427 --> 01:14:27.593
Let's do it again.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:38.472
Oh!

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.241
Adelina, throw something down.

01:14:46.713 --> 01:14:48.347
A rope would be better.

01:14:48.349 --> 01:14:51.418
I don't know. Three more of
them, and we could build a ramp.

01:14:54.889 --> 01:14:56.391
Oh, that feels lovely.

01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:05.466
Oh, no!

01:15:11.471 --> 01:15:13.007
Um...

01:15:13.707 --> 01:15:15.009
nice place.

01:15:15.542 --> 01:15:17.144
Aah!

01:15:17.945 --> 01:15:21.146
The people we don't want here
are leaving!

01:15:21.148 --> 01:15:22.915
Force them to stay!

01:15:24.918 --> 01:15:26.020
Aah!

01:15:48.742 --> 01:15:50.174
Tie this to your waist.

01:15:50.176 --> 01:15:52.911
We have a treacherous climb
ahead of us. Quickly!

01:15:52.913 --> 01:15:55.349
I don't think I have
my knot... Aah!

01:16:03.457 --> 01:16:05.758
This is where it ends, Frost.

01:16:06.927 --> 01:16:09.528
I can't allow you
to go any further.

01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:10.595
Look at you.

01:16:10.597 --> 01:16:14.566
Hand in hand
with apes and women.

01:16:14.568 --> 01:16:18.070
You'll never be one of us.

01:16:18.072 --> 01:16:20.141
Quite right. I never shall.

01:16:20.673 --> 01:16:23.241
You know, I really
don't care to anymore.

01:16:23.243 --> 01:16:25.076
I have changed my mind.

01:16:25.078 --> 01:16:27.379
I... I have evolved.

01:16:27.381 --> 01:16:31.217
What? Heh! That's...
That's preposterous.

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:33.285
Of course you want to be
one of us.

01:16:33.287 --> 01:16:35.321
We are great men!

01:16:35.323 --> 01:16:38.293
We shape the world!

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.760
It's funny...

01:16:41.762 --> 01:16:43.394
I actually used to think that.

01:16:43.396 --> 01:16:47.534
But now... now I rather think
the world shapes us.

01:16:48.101 --> 01:16:49.401
That was pretty good,
wasn't it?

01:16:49.403 --> 01:16:50.972
One of you should
write that down.

01:16:51.439 --> 01:16:53.571
- Excuse me. Can I borrow your...
- Hmm?

01:16:53.573 --> 01:16:57.276
You would cast aside
everything for that...

01:16:57.278 --> 01:16:59.713
that... thing?

01:17:00.347 --> 01:17:02.617
Yes. Yes, I would.

01:17:03.184 --> 01:17:05.951
And I'll have you know
that that thing has a name.

01:17:05.953 --> 01:17:07.486
It's Susan.

01:17:07.488 --> 01:17:10.156
That thing is an abomination!

01:17:10.158 --> 01:17:12.523
That thing is more of a man
than you'll ever be.

01:17:12.525 --> 01:17:14.326
And what's more,
he's my friend,

01:17:14.328 --> 01:17:18.097
which is a far better prize than any
fellowship with the likes of you.

01:17:18.099 --> 01:17:20.499
If you are still intent
on doing him harm,

01:17:20.501 --> 01:17:23.602
then you'll have to find
a way through me first.

01:17:23.604 --> 01:17:25.638
And me also.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.638
Yeah, and me.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.744
- You don't do that.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:32.076
Go through... Go through them.

01:17:42.355 --> 01:17:45.758
You can keep your missing link

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.093
and your lost world.

01:17:48.095 --> 01:17:49.727
You're welcome to them.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.576
No one will ever know
what you found here.

01:18:05.578 --> 01:18:10.816
And no one will ever
remember your name.

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:17.289
Uh, my Lord?

01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:20.925
Order will prevail!

01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:26.164
Civilization endures!

01:18:28.168 --> 01:18:30.535
You're a bad man.

01:18:33.907 --> 01:18:36.344
Run.

01:18:37.744 --> 01:18:39.247
Huh?

01:18:40.213 --> 01:18:41.914
Oh, bugger.

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.255
Oh!

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.222
Oh, no, no!

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:10.978
Ugh! Why am I always dangly?

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.146
Are we dead?

01:19:14.148 --> 01:19:15.750
Not yet.

01:19:16.716 --> 01:19:19.485
Seems you've had
your day at last, Frost.

01:19:19.487 --> 01:19:22.420
Now... Now here comes
the thaw.

01:19:22.422 --> 01:19:23.988
It doesn't have to be
this way, Stenk.

01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:25.191
Piggot-Dunceby's gone.

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:27.592
It ain't about the paycheck
no more.

01:19:27.594 --> 01:19:30.762
Now it's just a matter of
shallow, self-centered pride.

01:19:30.764 --> 01:19:34.534
Careful, Stenk. You know what
they say pride comes before.

01:19:35.168 --> 01:19:36.871
Wait, I know this.

01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:39.338
Is it Tuesday?

01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:46.581
Hah!

01:19:47.814 --> 01:19:48.781
Aah!

01:19:59.626 --> 01:20:00.795
Wha...?

01:20:08.269 --> 01:20:09.233
Aah!

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:22.350
Susan, try and reach the side!

01:20:35.162 --> 01:20:36.530
Oh!

01:20:39.966 --> 01:20:41.435
I can't get a hold!

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.601
Yes.

01:21:28.015 --> 01:21:30.385
Oh, no!

01:21:41.261 --> 01:21:42.864
Aah!

01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:18.832
I wanted to say thank you

01:22:19.733 --> 01:22:21.599
for what you said back there.

01:22:21.601 --> 01:22:23.637
Ah, don't even mention it.

01:22:24.704 --> 01:22:25.640
Okay.

01:22:31.078 --> 01:22:32.814
So, what happens now?

01:22:38.284 --> 01:22:39.453
I...

01:22:40.154 --> 01:22:41.555
I don't know.

01:22:42.355 --> 01:22:47.660
Uh, well, it turns out I'm on
the lookout for a new valet.

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:49.128
Partner.

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.463
Uh, partner.

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:52.397
You wouldn't happen
to know anyone, would you?

01:22:52.399 --> 01:22:54.331
I could ask around
if you want.

01:22:54.333 --> 01:22:57.704
Maybe the guy in the village with
the tongue. Would he be good?

01:22:58.404 --> 01:23:01.206
You, Mr. Link. I mean you.

01:23:01.208 --> 01:23:03.442
Me?

01:23:03.444 --> 01:23:06.245
Oh, my goodness!
Yes, then. Well, yes.

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:09.217
Of course! I do know someone!

01:23:11.484 --> 01:23:12.786
Hmm.

01:23:16.856 --> 01:23:17.958
Look!

01:23:36.944 --> 01:23:39.611
Your utopia sucks!

01:23:39.613 --> 01:23:41.045
Come along, Mr. Link.

01:23:41.047 --> 01:23:43.917
- Yeah, and get a haircut!
- That's enough.

01:23:44.685 --> 01:23:46.250
And your accent's weird!

01:23:46.252 --> 01:23:49.487
Bigger person, Mr. Link.
Be the bigger person.

01:23:57.730 --> 01:23:59.865
You have seen the world.

01:23:59.867 --> 01:24:02.570
Remember every moment
of it, Susan.

01:24:03.636 --> 01:24:06.039
And you, Adelina?
What did you see?

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:09.176
I saw proof.

01:24:15.349 --> 01:24:18.450
You are a great man,
Sir Lionel.

01:24:18.452 --> 01:24:20.655
But I deserve greater.

01:24:21.654 --> 01:24:24.356
It's time I went
on my own adventure.

01:24:24.358 --> 01:24:28.863
Not for you, not for Aldous,
not even for you, Susan.

01:24:29.296 --> 01:24:30.798
But for myself.

01:24:31.465 --> 01:24:33.000
Goodbye, gentlemen.

01:24:37.604 --> 01:24:39.740
Were you leaning in
for a kiss there?

01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:44.576
I've been there before, yeah.
I mean, I haven't,

01:24:44.578 --> 01:24:48.446
but I could imagine that's how
it would go down with me, too.

01:24:57.123 --> 01:24:58.158
Ooh.

01:25:04.296 --> 01:25:05.932
This is it, Mr. Link!

01:25:08.702 --> 01:25:10.201
The Fiji mermaid!

01:25:11.572 --> 01:25:14.305
This, Mr. Link,
might just provide the vital clue I need

01:25:14.307 --> 01:25:16.641
to the greatest discovery
of the century.

01:25:16.643 --> 01:25:18.476
But I thought
we did Shangri-La already.

01:25:18.478 --> 01:25:21.446
- No, no. Atlantis.
- You don't say?

01:25:21.448 --> 01:25:23.548
I do say. I'd swear on it.

01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:25.150
And you know I'm nothing
if not a man of my...

01:25:25.152 --> 01:25:26.451
Your word, yes, got it.

01:25:28.921 --> 01:25:31.656
Don't dally, my friend.
Adventure awaits.

01:25:31.658 --> 01:25:32.991
Ha-ha!

01:25:32.993 --> 01:25:34.829
Oh, boy!

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:38.097
Do I have time to get
my bathing suit? No?

01:34:08.375 --> 01:34:09.643
Aah!

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:19.315
