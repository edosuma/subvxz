00:54.988 --> 00:58.287
<i>It's said that the West
was built on legends.</i>

00:58.491 --> 01:02.257
<i>Tall tales that help us
make sense of things too great...</i>

01:02.462 --> 01:05.295
<i>...or too terrifying to believe.</i>

01:06.299 --> 01:09.894
<i>This is the legend of the Ghost Rider.</i>

01:19.879 --> 01:23.872
<i>Story goes
that every generation has one.</i>

01:24.084 --> 01:28.350
<i>Some damned soul,
cursed to ride the earth...</i>

01:28.555 --> 01:31.854
<i>...collecting on the devil's deals.</i>

01:34.861 --> 01:39.992
<i>Many years ago, a Ghost Rider was
sent to the village of San Venganza...</i>

01:40.834 --> 01:45.828
<i>...to fetch a contract
worth 1000 evil souls.</i>

01:46.773 --> 01:49.708
<i>But that contract was so powerful...</i>

01:53.313 --> 01:57.977
<i>...he knew he could never let
the devil get his hands on it.</i>

01:59.452 --> 02:03.183
<i>So he did what no Rider
has ever done before:</i>

02:08.495 --> 02:11.862
<i>He outran the devil himself.</i>

02:16.836 --> 02:19.327
<i>The thing about legends is...</i>

02:19.639 --> 02:22.836
<i>...sometimes they're true.</i>

03:11.858 --> 03:13.587
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

03:15.161 --> 03:17.425
<i>...the amazing, blazing...</i>

03:17.630 --> 03:20.997
<i>...stunt cycle spectacular!</i>

03:42.689 --> 03:47.149
<i>How about a big round of applause
for Barton and Johnny Blaze?</i>

03:54.033 --> 03:55.557
<i>Let's hear it for them, folks!</i>

04:07.780 --> 04:09.907
<i>You're a hotshot, ain't you, boy?</i>

04:10.850 --> 04:13.478
Young, think you know everything
there is to know.

04:13.686 --> 04:16.882
Think you're gonna live forever.
Is that about right?

04:17.089 --> 04:20.582
- Come on, Dad. It was a patch of dirt.
- That's not the point.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.223
Point is, we've been doing
this act less than a week.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.762
You're already screwing around.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.867
- I was just doing it for the crowd.
- We both know why you done it.

04:33.506 --> 04:36.703
You think she's gonna stand by you
when you're in a wheelchair?

04:40.046 --> 04:41.809
Huh, hotshot?

04:50.657 --> 04:55.356
Son, everything you do in life, every
choice you make has a consequence.

04:55.995 --> 04:58.054
When you do things
without thinking...

04:58.498 --> 05:00.989
...you ain't making the choice,
the choice is making you.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.999
- You understand that?
- Yeah, sure.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.297
What?

05:09.075 --> 05:10.702
I said, "Yes, sir."

05:44.043 --> 05:47.012
Hey, Dad, you think maybe I could take
Grace for a ride sometime?

05:47.213 --> 05:48.874
Think you're man enough
for Grace?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.811
Hell, yeah.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.818
Well, I don't.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.755
Hey, Johnny.

06:00.460 --> 06:01.688
Hey, Roxie.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.359
Go on.

06:33.092 --> 06:34.559
Hey.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.924
What's wrong, Roxie?

06:42.068 --> 06:43.262
I'm leaving.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.204
What?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.600
My dad's sending me
to live with my mom.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.279
- When?
- Soon.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.211
What about us?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.978
He says
you're not good enough for me.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.018
That you're just a phase.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.322
So what are we gonna do, Johnny?

07:10.730 --> 07:14.996
We'll leave. We'll jump on the bike
and just keep going.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.961
But what about your dad?
What about the show?

07:18.171 --> 07:21.140
He doesn't need me.
He doesn't need anybody.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.736
Tomorrow, noon. We'll meet here.

08:50.129 --> 08:51.790
What time is it?

08:52.632 --> 08:54.361
It's late.

09:08.915 --> 09:10.746
Where you going?

09:14.620 --> 09:16.417
Nowhere, Dad.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.586
I'm going nowhere.

09:51.824 --> 09:53.724
Far out.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.834
- Johnny Blaze.
- Yeah.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.567
Caught your show today.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.972
Just wanted to tell you how much
I enjoyed watching you ride.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.304
Oh, thanks.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.373
Perhaps you'd ride for me one day.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.406
You run a show?

10:18.851 --> 10:21.319
Greatest show on earth.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.421
Thanks, but no thanks.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.163
What's wrong, Johnny?

10:36.435 --> 10:38.733
Worried about your father?

10:41.374 --> 10:42.807
What do you know about that?

10:43.009 --> 10:45.773
Even a blind man
could see he's sick.

10:47.446 --> 10:50.745
Thing about cancer
is the time it takes...

10:51.517 --> 10:53.508
...the toll on the loved ones.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.316
Lives that are altered.

10:57.957 --> 11:01.051
Plans that have to be changed.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.223
Johnny...

11:06.399 --> 11:08.526
...what if I could help your dad?

11:10.069 --> 11:11.730
Yeah? How?

11:11.937 --> 11:14.428
How is not important.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.740
What if I could make him better?

11:19.045 --> 11:21.411
Give him back his health?

11:22.281 --> 11:24.943
Would you be willing
to make a deal?

11:28.788 --> 11:29.948
Name your price.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.556
I'll take...

11:39.632 --> 11:41.259
...your soul.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.440
Okay.

11:48.641 --> 11:53.908
By sunrise tomorrow, your father
will be healthy as a horse.

11:54.413 --> 11:58.850
And you will have your whole life
ahead of you.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.719
It's your choice, Johnny.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.915
All you have to do is sign.

12:31.150 --> 12:34.381
Oh, that'll do just fine.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.162
Damn.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.567
Morning, sleeping beauty.

12:50.402 --> 12:51.369
Dad?

12:53.005 --> 12:55.098
- You look--
- Great, right?

12:55.374 --> 12:58.571
Least that's what the doc said when
he looked at my x-rays this morning.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.043
- What are you talking about?
- I've been sick, son.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.648
When I finally get up
the nerve to tell you about it...

13:04.850 --> 13:06.374
...I'm not anymore.

13:07.052 --> 13:10.488
I can't explain it.
But I feel healthy as a horse.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.782
Now, come on, hotshot.
I got a show to do.

13:23.769 --> 13:27.432
Biggest crowd of the week. Hey,
you know what I was thinking about?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.905
A new stunt.
Put us over the top!

13:31.110 --> 13:33.943
Be a jump: me on one side,
you on the other.

13:34.146 --> 13:39.607
Instead of the cars or the ring of fire,
a helicopter.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.612
Yeah. That'd be pretty cool,
don't you think?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.954
Hey, you got two minutes to get
in your suit, son, or you're...

13:51.664 --> 13:53.996
Roxanne's dad
is sending her away.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.633
If we don't leave now,
it will be too late.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.603
Well, that's great, boy. That's great.
Two kids on the run with nothing.

14:02.074 --> 14:05.009
If your goal is to end up together,
that'll make sure it doesn't happen!

14:05.211 --> 14:07.805
I'd rather take my chances
with her than to waste my whole life...

14:08.013 --> 14:09.913
...jumping bikes
at some stupid carnival.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.979
Dad, I want something better
than that.

14:20.059 --> 14:23.256
Her old man will have the cops on you
before you get to county line.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.687
I guess I'd better get going then.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.706
Hey, hotshot.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.149
You take Grace.

14:53.058 --> 14:57.358
At least you'll have
a good head start.

15:07.673 --> 15:12.076
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Barton Blaze!</i>

15:42.508 --> 15:45.534
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
head for the exits.</i>

15:45.744 --> 15:47.234
<i>Please stay calm.</i>

15:47.713 --> 15:51.809
Dad? Dad, it's all right, I'm here.
I'm here, it's gonna be okay.

15:52.017 --> 15:52.984
Dad?

15:56.855 --> 15:59.050
Dad? Dad?

16:55.614 --> 16:58.014
You're no good to me dead.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.627
You. You killed him.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.393
I cured his cancer.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.297
That was the deal.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.637
But I couldn't let him
come between us.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.606
You son of a bitch.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.643
One day, when I need you...

17:32.985 --> 17:34.452
...I will come.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.916
Until then, I'll be...

17:39.124 --> 17:41.149
I'll be watching.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.062
Forget about friends.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.597
Forget about family.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.761
Forget about love.

17:57.876 --> 18:00.674
You're mine, Johnny Blaze.

18:49.928 --> 18:51.987
<i>You can't live in fear.</i>

18:52.898 --> 18:54.889
<i>You can't live in fear.</i>

18:59.271 --> 19:03.435
<i>Johnny, Johnny!
Johnny, Johnny!</i>

19:03.642 --> 19:05.610
<i>Johnny, Johnny!</i>

19:27.132 --> 19:29.157
Johnny Blaze!

19:29.568 --> 19:31.263
Yeah, Johnny! Yeah!

20:25.190 --> 20:26.214
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

20:26.425 --> 20:29.519
<i>...please stay off the field
to allow paramedics through.</i>

20:30.095 --> 20:32.188
Oh, God. Oh, God. JB!

20:40.505 --> 20:41.904
JB, talk to me, man!

20:47.446 --> 20:49.846
Heck, is the bike okay?

20:52.217 --> 20:54.845
Yeah. Yeah.

20:55.053 --> 20:58.284
Bike's fine. Oh, God.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.058
Thank you.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.653
Let's go home.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.192
<i>Let's hear it for him, folks.</i>

21:08.400 --> 21:11.961
<i>The amazing Johnny Blaze!</i>

21:13.672 --> 21:17.164
Johnny, you gave us all a big scare.
What happened out there tonight?

21:17.376 --> 21:20.539
Hey, JB don't do interviews,
all right? I'm sorry. Excuse me.

21:39.364 --> 21:40.592
Yeah, come on, come on.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.992
Get the front end down. Damn it.

21:44.202 --> 21:45.362
<i>Blaze is down.</i>

21:45.570 --> 21:48.368
- Have you tried not crashing?
- Have you?

21:50.409 --> 21:53.469
Why don't you have a beer
and relax like everybody else, huh?

21:53.679 --> 21:55.772
You know alcohol
gives me nightmares.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.410
To each his own.

22:08.393 --> 22:09.621
Oh, wait, could you go back?

22:09.828 --> 22:13.320
There's a howler monkey special
on Discovery Channel tonight.

22:13.532 --> 22:16.023
<i>- Guys, hey.
- We've seen big moves and crashes.</i>

22:16.535 --> 22:18.969
<i>But ask these riders
who it is they look up to...</i>

22:19.171 --> 22:22.800
<i>...and the answer's a man who's not
even competing here, Johnny Blaze.</i>

22:23.141 --> 22:25.439
Yeah, that's because he's right here!

22:25.644 --> 22:27.271
<i>--greatest stunt rider of all time...</i>

22:27.479 --> 22:30.744
<i>...but what we don't know is how
much longer can Blaze cheat death.</i>

22:30.949 --> 22:33.747
<i>- Critics call it pay-per-view suicide--
- Put the monkey show on.</i>

22:33.952 --> 22:36.045
Mack, the monkey show?

22:36.254 --> 22:37.983
<i>--with no regard for his own life.</i>

22:38.190 --> 22:41.523
<i>They call him Mr. Invincible,
and he'll have to be at his next jump...</i>

22:41.727 --> 22:43.695
<i>...when Johnny Blaze
will attempt to clear...</i>

22:43.895 --> 22:46.887
<i>...the length of a football field
from field goal to field goal.</i>

22:54.873 --> 22:56.238
What?

22:57.743 --> 23:02.612
"What." You should be taking
a dirt nap after that ragdoll today.

23:03.348 --> 23:04.508
I got lucky.

23:04.716 --> 23:08.709
No, I got a hunting dog named Lucky.
He's got one eye and no nuts.

23:09.054 --> 23:13.286
Luck don't cover it, JB. Man, you got
an angel looking after you.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.023
- Yeah, maybe.
- Mack, you in?

23:18.063 --> 23:19.690
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.731
Scoot over, ladies.
What's the ante?

23:22.934 --> 23:24.162
Five card draw.

23:24.369 --> 23:26.633
Maybe it's something else.

24:13.051 --> 24:14.211
There you go.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.851
Took you long enough.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.872
I think you might be lost, boy.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.810
You deaf or something?

24:46.885 --> 24:48.512
Angels only in there.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.314
Angels. Really?

24:52.691 --> 24:55.524
Yeah, really.
You got a problem with that?

24:57.596 --> 24:58.893
As a matter of fact...

25:16.314 --> 25:17.406
...I do.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.256
Yep.
Love your neighborhood, Johnny.

25:30.829 --> 25:32.820
Real friendly around here.

25:38.770 --> 25:42.399
Oh, I see you still haven't gotten
a lock for your lift. That's great, great.

25:42.607 --> 25:46.441
You've got a lot of expensive bikes
in here, I told you. How many times?

25:47.913 --> 25:50.541
Well, JB, I said it before,
I'll say it again:

25:50.749 --> 25:52.683
This place could use a woman's touch.

25:53.785 --> 25:56.413
- So could you.
- Heard that.

25:58.657 --> 26:02.593
All right, four out of five. Wreck
one more and you get the whole set.

26:06.965 --> 26:09.297
Well, I'm glad to see
you found use for your books.

26:09.668 --> 26:10.930
You want some jellies?

26:11.136 --> 26:14.037
No. I don't want
none of your stupid candy.

26:18.944 --> 26:21.276
I wanna talk to you about
something kind of serious.

26:21.479 --> 26:22.639
I'm trying to relax, Mack.

26:22.847 --> 26:26.044
Yeah, I understand. All right?
It's just gonna take a second.

26:31.656 --> 26:35.092
It's about you jumping on the
anniversary of your dad's accident.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.156
Can I just turn this music off
for a minute?

26:41.666 --> 26:44.134
<i>I want you to kick higher for me.
Can you get higher?</i>

26:44.336 --> 26:46.133
This jump, man, we--

26:46.338 --> 26:47.771
<i>Come on! Hit it!</i>

26:48.773 --> 26:52.004
Mack, you touch the Carpenters
or that chimp video again...

26:52.210 --> 26:56.271
- ...and we got a scrap on our hands.
- This jump is nuts. All right, man?

26:56.481 --> 26:59.416
I mean, field goal to field goal,
and now you're adding cars?

27:00.352 --> 27:02.582
I mean, what are you
trying to prove?

27:03.655 --> 27:04.917
That it's me.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.652
That it's you?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.490
Riding the bike.

27:09.094 --> 27:11.790
Of course it's you, man.
Who the hell else is it gonna be?

27:11.997 --> 27:13.862
You know what,
you're freaking me out.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.158
You're freaking me out
because you're reading...

27:16.368 --> 27:19.235
...this comparative exponential
religiosity crap.

27:19.537 --> 27:21.334
It's getting in your brain.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.176
I mean, what's going on, man?

27:26.311 --> 27:28.802
Do you believe
people get second chances?

27:29.314 --> 27:30.508
I-- I don't know.

27:30.715 --> 27:34.674
If somebody makes a mistake,
a big mistake...

27:34.886 --> 27:37.320
...do you think that person
should have to pay for it...

27:37.522 --> 27:39.649
...every day
for the rest of their lives?

27:40.225 --> 27:42.625
Are you talking about
your daddy's accident?

27:44.496 --> 27:45.622
Well...

27:47.932 --> 27:49.490
I'm just looking for a sign.

27:50.535 --> 27:51.866
What kind of sign?

27:53.872 --> 27:56.670
That I can take a negative
and turn it into a positive.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.866
That I can have a second chance too.

28:01.646 --> 28:05.673
JB, what happened way back when
to your daddy was not your fault.

28:06.985 --> 28:08.213
You know that, right?

28:12.424 --> 28:16.656
Look, at least promise me
you'll think about taking the cars out.

28:17.962 --> 28:18.986
I'll think about it.

29:09.647 --> 29:13.139
I knew you were here.
I could smell your fear.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.359
Hello, Gressil.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.433
Why are you here?

29:41.045 --> 29:42.012
Wallow.

29:47.185 --> 29:48.812
And what do you want from us?

29:49.020 --> 29:51.454
I've come for the contract
of San Venganza.

29:53.057 --> 29:55.548
Legend has it that the contract
was stolen and hidden...

29:55.760 --> 29:57.660
...in a graveyard not far from here.

29:57.862 --> 29:59.693
And now you're gonna help me find it.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.100
Abigor.

30:06.504 --> 30:08.734
And when we find it, then what?

30:08.940 --> 30:10.567
Then we'll take this world...

30:11.442 --> 30:13.433
...one city...

30:15.046 --> 30:16.343
...at a time.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.776
Blackheart!

30:37.235 --> 30:41.638
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's my time now, old man.

30:41.973 --> 30:46.376
Your time will come.
But not now.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.546
We both know
you can't harm me here.

30:48.746 --> 30:53.843
I'm not like you. I've never fallen.
I never will.

30:54.052 --> 30:59.752
I may not have power over you
in this world, but my rider does.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.524
The Ghost Rider?

31:05.163 --> 31:07.427
Your favorite creation?

31:07.966 --> 31:11.993
The power of hellfire
wasted on a pathetic human?

31:12.270 --> 31:14.135
If you had trusted me...

31:14.873 --> 31:16.966
...if you had given me
what was rightfully mine--

31:17.175 --> 31:21.544
It's all mine.
Until the end of days.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.540
Go ahead.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.249
Send the rider.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.412
I'll bury him.

31:30.855 --> 31:32.880
And then I'll bury you.

31:33.625 --> 31:34.887
Father.

31:48.940 --> 31:53.343
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Johnny Blaze Leap of Death!</i>

31:57.382 --> 31:58.849
Yeah!

32:04.923 --> 32:05.890
Johnny B!

32:14.465 --> 32:15.898
Hey, JB.

32:16.734 --> 32:18.531
You're stepping on Karen.

32:23.808 --> 32:25.935
What was it
you were gonna say, Mack?

32:26.611 --> 32:29.546
I just ran a second check
on the ramps. They look good.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.384
Crowd's kind of out of control.

32:34.585 --> 32:37.486
Johnny, you know
you don't have to do this, don't you?

32:40.191 --> 32:42.887
Does this suit fit all right?
Feels a little loose.

32:44.195 --> 32:45.526
Suit's fine.

32:45.730 --> 32:49.063
Would you bring me my hat, Mack?
Thank you.

32:56.007 --> 32:57.941
You can't live in fear.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.575
All right, we're up here on the right.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.645
Mr. Blaze. Amy Page, event publicity.

33:04.849 --> 33:07.409
- Have time for a quick interview?
- I don't know how long...

33:07.618 --> 33:10.485
...you been doing your job,
but Johnny Blaze don't do interviews.

33:10.688 --> 33:12.519
Not even for an old friend?

33:24.102 --> 33:25.262
<i>Hey, Johnny.</i>

33:29.640 --> 33:30.902
Hi.

33:33.044 --> 33:34.170
I'll do it.

33:35.079 --> 33:36.410
Makeup.

33:38.983 --> 33:40.780
He's good.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.482
Oh, you're looking at the suit.

33:45.690 --> 33:49.820
I know it's silly, but the fans
like it, so I keep on wearing it.

33:50.828 --> 33:54.161
- What about the cane?
- I need support.

33:54.499 --> 33:56.797
No. It's part of the costume.

33:57.635 --> 34:02.971
Okay, and ready
in five, four, three, two...

34:03.174 --> 34:04.607
How's your dad?

34:05.743 --> 34:09.110
Johnny Blaze, thank you for talking
to us before your big jump.

34:09.313 --> 34:12.304
No one has ever attempted
such a distance before:

34:12.516 --> 34:15.384
Three hundred feet
from field goal to field goal.

34:15.585 --> 34:17.815
What's going through your mind
right now?

34:18.022 --> 34:21.355
You look really good.
I've seen you on TV.

34:21.559 --> 34:25.120
You know, I watch a lot of TV
and you do a really good job.

34:27.931 --> 34:30.958
Johnny, what drives somebody
to risk their life for entertainment?

34:31.168 --> 34:32.534
I heard you got married.

34:35.106 --> 34:36.902
Oh, no. No, it didn't happen.

34:37.909 --> 34:38.933
No?

34:41.279 --> 34:44.679
Most of the time the press focuses on
the crashes, the broken bones...

34:44.882 --> 34:46.179
...the costs of what you do.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.251
Are there any other costs?

34:48.453 --> 34:50.114
<i>--commemorating this
epic milestone...</i>

34:50.321 --> 34:52.812
<i>...in the life of
the world's greatest stuntman.</i>

34:53.824 --> 34:56.726
<i>And remember, 40 percent
of all proceeds tonight...</i>

34:56.928 --> 34:58.793
<i>- Yeah.
- ...go to the Barton Blaze Foundation...</i>

34:58.996 --> 35:02.124
<i>...dedicated to helping those in need
here in our home state...</i>

35:02.333 --> 35:03.698
Okay, well...

35:03.901 --> 35:06.927
Thank you for this revealing peek
into the life of Johnny Blaze.

35:07.605 --> 35:10.165
I'm Roxanne Simpson, on scene.

35:10.641 --> 35:11.733
And we're out.

35:12.877 --> 35:16.313
- You're gonna stay for the jump, right?
- You know, we gotta get back.

35:16.514 --> 35:18.812
Plus, I never liked watching you jump.

35:25.389 --> 35:26.754
- Please.
- Let's go, guys.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.357
Roxanne?

35:35.199 --> 35:39.431
- Come on, just one signature.
- You need to get back to your seat.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.039
- You don't have to push.
- All right.

35:43.241 --> 35:46.699
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say
you two had some kind of history.

35:47.044 --> 35:48.636
That was it, Mack.

35:49.213 --> 35:50.510
The sign.

35:50.848 --> 35:52.008
The sign?

35:54.385 --> 35:56.979
- Sure you don't wanna stick around?
- No.

35:57.188 --> 35:58.849
It hasn't started yet.

35:59.290 --> 36:00.848
I'll buy you a doughnut.

36:01.526 --> 36:03.517
Come on, Roxie, it's Johnny Blaze.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.320
Let's go.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.889
Thank God you listened to me,
took the cars out.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.192
It would've been suicide otherwise.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.665
This way if you come up short, see...

36:12.870 --> 36:16.567
...you'll come down
on some nice, soft, green...

36:19.110 --> 36:20.202
...grass.

36:20.411 --> 36:24.211
<i>Johnny Blaze will not be jumping
50 cars today as scheduled...</i>

36:24.415 --> 36:28.943
<i>...but instead will be leaping
six UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.</i>

36:29.153 --> 36:33.249
<i>Never before has any man attempted
such a death-defying stunt.</i>

36:34.158 --> 36:35.955
I took the cars out.

36:41.766 --> 36:43.597
Why? Why, JB?
Why wouldn't you tell me?

36:43.801 --> 36:46.565
- Because you would have thrown a fit.
- Call me old-fashioned...

36:46.771 --> 36:49.706
...I'm funny that way. Human sacrifice
makes me uncomfortable.

36:51.075 --> 36:53.339
Why, JB? Why helicopters, man?

36:54.412 --> 36:57.313
<i>You know what I've been
thinking about? A new stunt.</i>

36:57.515 --> 37:00.416
But instead of the cars
or the ring of fire...

37:01.352 --> 37:02.819
...a helicopter.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.281
My dad thought it'd be cool.

37:10.494 --> 37:12.724
- He was right.
- Yeah.

37:13.664 --> 37:15.427
Okay. Okay. This is the deal, man.

37:15.633 --> 37:18.363
Halfway down the ramp I want you
to hit the NOS, okay?

37:18.569 --> 37:19.831
Do not hit the NOS too early.

37:20.037 --> 37:22.528
If you hit it too early, you are screwed.
You got that?

37:23.207 --> 37:25.402
Hey, JB, where's your head at, man?

37:26.677 --> 37:29.908
She's probably on the interstate
by now, huh?

37:37.021 --> 37:38.784
How much NOS
did you put in the tanks?

37:38.990 --> 37:41.959
Enough to shame the space shuttle.
Chief, go ahead.

37:51.569 --> 37:53.594
Oh, God. He ain't gonna make it.

38:12.890 --> 38:14.323
He made it!

38:17.328 --> 38:19.819
I told you he'd make it! Yeah, JB!

38:20.031 --> 38:21.931
<i>Let's hear it for him,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

38:22.133 --> 38:25.591
<i>Three hundred feet! A world record,
as only Johnny Blaze can do!</i>

38:36.614 --> 38:39.412
Yeah! Yeah!

38:46.157 --> 38:47.249
Where's he going?

38:47.458 --> 38:50.325
I'll say one thing about the guy,
he's got guts.

38:50.528 --> 38:53.463
I mean, the other day I was watching
this, like, sports show--

38:53.664 --> 38:56.599
Stuart, can you please stop talking
about Johnny Blaze already?

39:00.171 --> 39:02.503
Yeah, that might be a little hard.

39:05.943 --> 39:07.001
I made it!

39:09.046 --> 39:12.311
- Pull over!
- Do you want me to pull over?

39:12.516 --> 39:14.541
- Drive.
- Driving.

39:22.526 --> 39:25.154
Come on, Roxie,
I need to talk to you.

39:35.439 --> 39:36.633
What's your name?

39:37.108 --> 39:39.099
- What?
- What's your name?

39:39.310 --> 39:40.902
Oh, Stuart!

39:41.712 --> 39:43.270
- Johnny.
- Hi.

39:43.481 --> 39:45.608
Well, Stuart,
can you help me out here?

39:47.718 --> 39:49.652
Sorry, dude. She's the boss.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.690
Johnny, look out!

40:03.167 --> 40:06.603
All right, I guess I see
how it's gonna be. Hang on!

40:25.256 --> 40:27.588
Howdy. Howdy, howdy, howdy.

40:27.792 --> 40:29.760
Are you trying to kill yourself?

40:29.960 --> 40:33.293
I wanna talk to you.
I haven't seen you in 56,000 years.

40:33.497 --> 40:35.089
This is crazy. You are crazy.

40:35.299 --> 40:37.597
I don't have time for this,
I have a story to edit.

40:37.802 --> 40:39.167
You could have said no.

40:40.538 --> 40:44.133
When they asked you to interview me,
you could have said no.

40:45.409 --> 40:48.572
- Move your van out of the way!
- What are you trying to say?

40:48.779 --> 40:51.873
Well, I'm not trying to say anything.
I'm saying that means something.

40:53.384 --> 40:56.012
- Sorry!
- Don't mind them, they're fine.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.245
We are on the side of the freeway.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.948
Let's get some dinner.
You still like Italian?

41:04.962 --> 41:07.692
What's this about, Johnny?
You want some closure?

41:08.699 --> 41:11.429
Look, you were 17 and you witnessed
a tragedy and you ran.

41:11.635 --> 41:13.603
I understand now
like I understood then...

41:13.804 --> 41:15.669
...and I have no hard feelings, none.

41:15.873 --> 41:19.741
That's why they call it the past, because
it's passed. It's done, it's over with.

41:27.051 --> 41:28.211
Too much?

41:32.356 --> 41:36.759
There's a restaurant in my hotel,
the Plaza. Eight o'clock.

41:37.127 --> 41:38.287
Yes!

41:41.832 --> 41:43.060
Don't be late.

41:43.267 --> 41:45.258
This is a sign, Roxanne.

41:45.469 --> 41:47.403
There are no accidents.

41:47.605 --> 41:49.573
Destiny and all that.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.433
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

41:51.642 --> 41:54.008
- Can you please sign my sister's book?
- Oh, sure.

41:54.211 --> 41:55.200
- 300 feet.
- We love you.

41:55.412 --> 41:56.811
Well, thank you.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.141
Three hundred feet.
Pretty neat, pretty neat.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.544
Right on, Johnny.

42:07.091 --> 42:08.217
Thank you.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.782
You can't live in fear.

42:33.684 --> 42:35.811
You can't live in fear.

42:37.021 --> 42:39.455
You made that jump.
No one else made that jump.

42:39.657 --> 42:41.488
You're the best rider.

42:44.662 --> 42:47.153
You deserve a second chance.

42:47.698 --> 42:49.598
She's a sign.

43:08.218 --> 43:10.413
<i>Johnny.</i>

43:38.315 --> 43:39.509
Okay.

44:10.347 --> 44:13.908
<i>Johnny.</i>

44:55.559 --> 44:56.685
You.

44:57.995 --> 44:59.587
Hello, Johnny.

45:00.431 --> 45:02.296
Stay away from me.

45:02.866 --> 45:04.493
Little late for that.

45:06.136 --> 45:07.603
Nice bike.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.598
Why are you here?

45:11.809 --> 45:15.370
Oh, I've always been here, Johnny.

45:15.846 --> 45:16.813
All along.

45:17.481 --> 45:18.948
Phoenix...

45:19.149 --> 45:20.309
...Denver...

45:20.517 --> 45:21.711
...Houston.

45:22.486 --> 45:25.319
It was you. Keeping me alive.

45:25.522 --> 45:27.547
No. No, Johnny.

45:27.758 --> 45:29.225
It's all you.

45:30.094 --> 45:31.721
You're the best.

45:32.296 --> 45:35.094
And I'm your greatest fan.

45:35.766 --> 45:39.133
The posters, the video games...

45:39.336 --> 45:43.864
...the crowds screaming, chanting:

45:44.074 --> 45:45.268
"Johnny.

45:46.443 --> 45:47.740
Johnny.

45:49.213 --> 45:50.737
Johnny."

45:52.616 --> 45:54.675
It makes me so proud.

45:56.453 --> 45:59.820
It's like watching an investment...

46:00.023 --> 46:03.083
...that keeps growing and growing...

46:03.293 --> 46:07.320
...until the day you cash it in.

46:08.465 --> 46:10.933
That day is today, Johnny.

46:11.668 --> 46:14.796
Find the one known as Blackheart...

46:15.172 --> 46:17.197
...and destroy him.

46:17.407 --> 46:19.136
Find him yourself.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.706
Doesn't work like that.

46:22.546 --> 46:25.242
You're under contract, remember?

46:27.217 --> 46:28.775
If you succeed...

46:29.887 --> 46:32.412
...I'll return your soul.

46:33.323 --> 46:35.120
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

46:35.492 --> 46:37.653
You don't have any choice.

47:50.601 --> 47:52.068
Hey.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.464
You can't come in here.
This is private...

47:59.142 --> 48:00.200
...property.

48:00.410 --> 48:02.378
There was a cemetery here.

48:03.313 --> 48:04.940
Yeah, a long time ago.

48:06.183 --> 48:08.014
What happened to the graves?

48:10.087 --> 48:11.486
They moved them.

48:12.256 --> 48:13.223
Where?

48:16.526 --> 48:18.994
- I don't know.
- Who would?

48:21.498 --> 48:23.932
Saint Michael's church.

48:24.301 --> 48:26.599
They're in charge of the whole thing.

48:27.371 --> 48:29.498
Look, you really shouldn't be here.

48:32.075 --> 48:34.043
That's what they keep telling me.

48:54.464 --> 48:55.692
God!

49:59.997 --> 50:01.157
Looking for someone?

50:03.033 --> 50:04.694
Back to hell.

50:05.802 --> 50:09.135
We're not gonna have a meaningful
conversation now, are we?

50:09.506 --> 50:11.531
You're going down.

50:13.076 --> 50:14.304
I don't think so.

51:02.325 --> 51:03.917
He ain't so tough.

51:12.069 --> 51:14.560
Hey. Dirtbag.

51:27.217 --> 51:28.377
Have mercy.

51:28.585 --> 51:31.748
Sorry. All out of mercy.

51:45.902 --> 51:48.666
Help me!

52:51.234 --> 52:52.667
Wait.

52:52.903 --> 52:54.803
You think I'm pretty, right?

52:59.976 --> 53:01.739
Oh, God.

53:06.917 --> 53:07.941
Give me the damn bag!

53:08.351 --> 53:09.579
Help!

53:11.721 --> 53:12.949
Help!

53:24.768 --> 53:25.894
Thanks.

53:30.106 --> 53:31.403
You.

53:31.775 --> 53:32.901
Guilty.

53:38.148 --> 53:40.742
Look into my eyes.

53:48.024 --> 53:51.482
Your soul is stained
by the blood of the innocent.

53:53.530 --> 53:55.361
Feel their pain.

53:55.565 --> 54:00.161
No!

54:06.576 --> 54:07.634
Give me your wallet!

54:11.881 --> 54:13.212
Let me go!

55:50.146 --> 55:51.943
Morning, bonehead.

57:04.387 --> 57:05.820
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

57:06.022 --> 57:08.957
I feel like my skull's on fire,
but I'm good. Thanks for the water.

57:09.159 --> 57:10.148
Did you see my bike?

57:12.195 --> 57:13.526
Did I say something funny?

57:13.897 --> 57:15.023
Ironic.

57:15.398 --> 57:17.992
We're big on irony around here.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.900
- It's out by the shed.
- Thanks.

57:22.105 --> 57:23.572
It does.

57:24.808 --> 57:25.775
What?

57:25.975 --> 57:29.536
You're wondering if your bike
looks normal? It does.

57:30.380 --> 57:31.972
And to answer your other questions:

57:32.182 --> 57:34.013
Last night did happen...

57:34.217 --> 57:35.912
...it wasn't a dream...

57:36.453 --> 57:38.546
...and it will happen again.

57:39.422 --> 57:40.753
Who are you?

57:41.891 --> 57:45.156
Question is, who are you?

57:46.629 --> 57:49.894
You are the Rider.
The Ghost Rider.

57:51.267 --> 57:54.134
Get used to it, kid.
It'll be a lot easier.

57:54.337 --> 57:57.306
If you don't, I got a nice cozy spot
picked out for you.

58:11.024 --> 58:14.585
They've seen you now.
They'll be waiting for you.

58:15.362 --> 58:18.422
You'll need my help,
you expect to last the night.

58:18.732 --> 58:22.065
Last time I let a stranger help me
it didn't pan out so good.

58:22.402 --> 58:25.030
This ain't something
you can run from, kid.

58:25.472 --> 58:27.872
This day has been coming
since you made that deal.

58:37.651 --> 58:39.516
Congratulations.

58:39.719 --> 58:42.688
Your chances
just went from none to slim.

58:43.590 --> 58:46.684
Sources close to the investigation
say that there may be a link...

58:46.893 --> 58:48.918
...between what happened
here in downtown...

58:49.129 --> 58:51.393
...and the Broken Spoke massacre
in the desert.

58:51.598 --> 58:53.463
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

58:54.301 --> 58:55.598
And we're out.

58:57.537 --> 58:58.731
- Captain Dolan.
- No comment.

58:58.939 --> 59:01.635
Is it true they found a connection
between the massacre...

59:01.842 --> 59:04.470
...and last night's victim
here at the city train yards?

59:08.815 --> 59:10.112
No comment.

59:12.586 --> 59:13.712
Off the record, captain.

59:17.424 --> 59:19.085
Off the record?

59:19.392 --> 59:20.359
Piss off.

59:25.832 --> 59:28.266
The Rider is the devil's bounty hunter.

59:30.136 --> 59:33.537
Sent to hunt down anyone
that escapes from hell.

59:34.374 --> 59:36.569
Sterilize that for me.

59:37.043 --> 59:38.601
Sterilize.

59:44.217 --> 59:45.980
In the boiling water.

59:46.720 --> 59:48.187
Right. Okay.

59:49.556 --> 59:51.524
Little confused.

59:52.359 --> 59:54.691
During the day you'll be normal.

59:55.395 --> 59:56.828
But at night...

59:58.331 --> 01:00:00.196
...in the presence of evil...

01:00:01.034 --> 01:00:02.797
...the Rider takes over.

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:05.697
I remember now.

01:00:06.306 --> 01:00:07.500
Last night.

01:00:11.011 --> 01:00:14.469
There was some punk...

01:00:14.681 --> 01:00:18.048
...and I could see all the wrong
he'd ever done...

01:00:18.585 --> 01:00:20.883
...and I turned it all against him.

01:00:21.555 --> 01:00:23.386
The Penance Stare.

01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:27.359
It sears the souls of the wicked.

01:00:28.595 --> 01:00:31.393
It's the Ghost Rider's greatest weapon.

01:00:31.598 --> 01:00:33.532
All the Riders have it.

01:00:35.435 --> 01:00:40.566
Have there been others
with my "Ghost Rider" problem?

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:42.408
Been a few.

01:00:42.609 --> 01:00:45.237
Last one was 150 years ago...

01:00:46.279 --> 01:00:49.146
...in a little town
called San Venganza.

01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:51.815
Nice town.

01:00:52.886 --> 01:00:54.410
Nice people.

01:00:54.621 --> 01:00:57.715
Till a stranger came along
making promises...

01:00:58.458 --> 01:01:00.255
...one deal at a time.

01:01:01.094 --> 01:01:04.928
Consumed by greed,
they turned on one another...

01:01:05.332 --> 01:01:09.894
...until the village of San Venganza
drowned in its own blood...

01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:14.864
...their souls trapped forever
in that godforsaken place.

01:01:15.508 --> 01:01:17.476
What's this have to do
with Blackheart?

01:01:19.846 --> 01:01:21.177
Blackheart?

01:01:23.383 --> 01:01:25.351
He sent you after Blackheart?

01:01:26.152 --> 01:01:27.449
And others.

01:01:27.887 --> 01:01:29.184
The Hidden.

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:36.092
Fallen angels cast out of heaven
by Saint Michael himself.

01:01:36.796 --> 01:01:41.995
They hide within the elements
waiting for the end of days.

01:01:45.305 --> 01:01:47.603
You better hang around here, kid.

01:01:49.809 --> 01:01:52.403
They can't come
onto hallowed ground.

01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:55.348
Thanks.

01:01:56.016 --> 01:01:57.278
And thanks for the info.

01:01:57.484 --> 01:02:00.510
I feel much better now that I know
I'm the devil's bounty hunter.

01:02:04.324 --> 01:02:07.316
- Where you going?
- Somebody I gotta see.

01:02:07.527 --> 01:02:09.324
That's a bad idea.

01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:12.895
Wouldn't be my first.

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:18.595
Why'd you do it?

01:02:21.574 --> 01:02:23.371
Why'd you make the deal?

01:02:24.077 --> 01:02:25.442
I was a kid.

01:02:26.212 --> 01:02:28.009
What'd you get in return?

01:02:33.253 --> 01:02:34.811
Heartache.

01:02:45.732 --> 01:02:48.394
Captain. Captain!

01:02:49.436 --> 01:02:51.666
Forensics on the bikers
and the station manager...

01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:54.066
...suggest the same cause of death.

01:02:55.575 --> 01:02:57.008
Sulfur poison?

01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:00.236
- I didn't think sulfur was toxic.
- It is, in massive doses.

01:03:00.447 --> 01:03:02.745
And these guys were swimming in it.

01:03:02.949 --> 01:03:04.917
Could be the work
of a chemical attack.

01:03:05.118 --> 01:03:06.983
Or a religious nut.

01:03:07.187 --> 01:03:10.020
Hey. I know you. I've seen--

01:03:11.691 --> 01:03:15.593
Okay? There's nothing here
to suggest any kind of religious m.o.

01:03:15.795 --> 01:03:17.763
- Sulfur?
- What about it?

01:03:17.964 --> 01:03:19.693
Ever read the Old Testament?

01:03:22.535 --> 01:03:23.797
Brimstone.

01:03:24.504 --> 01:03:26.096
There you go.

01:03:32.746 --> 01:03:33.872
Oh, my God.

01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:45.283
It's hard to describe the destruction
here this morning.

01:03:45.492 --> 01:03:47.722
Can I get you people
to stand back, please?

01:03:47.927 --> 01:03:51.419
I don't know. It seems like
something supernatural.

01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:53.826
Could you tell us about
the Good Samaritan?

01:03:54.033 --> 01:03:56.331
Well, I'll never forget him,
that's for sure.

01:03:56.870 --> 01:04:01.307
He was tall, broad shoulders,
and thin, really thin, like bony.

01:04:01.508 --> 01:04:05.274
And he had this rad chopper,
it was all flames and stuff.

01:04:05.478 --> 01:04:10.677
Oh, and his face was a skull
and it was on fire.

01:04:14.354 --> 01:04:15.753
"On fire."

01:04:16.222 --> 01:04:17.519
Yeah, like:

01:04:20.126 --> 01:04:21.684
Like that much fire.

01:04:21.895 --> 01:04:25.160
And I know it sounds weird,
but it looked okay on him.

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:29.324
I mean, it was an edge look
but he totally pulled it off.

01:04:31.304 --> 01:04:32.896
Not sure what to add to that.

01:04:34.274 --> 01:04:37.004
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

01:04:38.645 --> 01:04:39.612
Thanks.

01:04:47.487 --> 01:04:49.182
- Roxie--
- Don't.

01:04:49.923 --> 01:04:52.414
Now, hold on a second.
Let me apologize.

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:55.594
- Last night was inexcusable.
- No apologies.

01:04:55.795 --> 01:04:58.628
See, you did me a favor last night...

01:04:58.832 --> 01:05:01.300
...because you made me think
of then and now.

01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:03.969
And when you left,
yeah, it hurt like hell.

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:06.434
But you know what? I got over it...

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.809
...and I went to college,
I got a great job.

01:05:10.476 --> 01:05:12.034
But you, Johnny...

01:05:12.745 --> 01:05:14.303
...you're just the same.

01:05:15.215 --> 01:05:17.877
Oh, better paid, more fans...

01:05:18.084 --> 01:05:20.052
...but you're still just a carny.

01:05:25.692 --> 01:05:26.716
Yeah.

01:05:27.794 --> 01:05:29.091
Oh, man.

01:05:29.929 --> 01:05:31.590
My dad was right.

01:05:31.798 --> 01:05:33.322
You were just a phase.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.964
That went well.

01:05:47.046 --> 01:05:49.344
Hey, captain! I got something.

01:06:48.241 --> 01:06:49.902
"End of days.

01:06:54.714 --> 01:06:58.480
The host can gain control
of the possessing spirit...

01:06:58.685 --> 01:07:03.019
...through concentration on
and manipulation of...

01:07:03.222 --> 01:07:06.919
...the fire element
that exists within man."

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:20.767
I am speaking to the fire element
within me.

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:26.505
Give me control
over the possessing spirit.

01:07:48.835 --> 01:07:49.995
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:07:50.203 --> 01:07:53.138
Hey, I hope you don't mind.
Your lift was open.

01:07:56.676 --> 01:07:58.610
I came to apologize.

01:07:59.012 --> 01:08:01.344
I'm leaving town tonight...

01:08:02.515 --> 01:08:06.315
...and I didn't want what I said today
to be the last words between us.

01:08:06.686 --> 01:08:09.678
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

01:08:10.857 --> 01:08:14.384
It was cruel and totally untrue.

01:08:14.594 --> 01:08:16.255
And I feel really terrible about it.

01:08:16.462 --> 01:08:18.794
Please, don't. It's okay.

01:08:21.634 --> 01:08:22.600
Is something burning?

01:08:24.037 --> 01:08:27.996
Oh, that must be coming from outside.
Neighbor's hibachi.

01:08:28.207 --> 01:08:29.299
Bill, he just got it.

01:08:29.876 --> 01:08:31.207
I still have that one.

01:08:32.011 --> 01:08:32.978
You what?

01:08:35.615 --> 01:08:37.674
I have that one, too.

01:08:46.526 --> 01:08:48.517
I remember that day.

01:08:49.962 --> 01:08:51.862
There were a dozen people
waiting in line...

01:08:52.064 --> 01:08:54.295
...and you went through
a whole roll of quarters.

01:08:55.001 --> 01:08:57.902
Look at my face.
You can tell I was just terrified...

01:08:58.104 --> 01:09:00.937
...that my dad was gonna
come in any second.

01:09:15.888 --> 01:09:17.354
Okay, I just--

01:09:19.524 --> 01:09:22.823
It's just-- I think I should
walk you to your car.

01:09:26.198 --> 01:09:28.189
See, it's not great timing.

01:09:32.438 --> 01:09:34.497
You almost kill yourself
on the highway...

01:09:34.707 --> 01:09:37.005
...so you can ask me out
and then you don't show.

01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:38.871
Then you keep my picture...

01:09:39.078 --> 01:09:42.206
...but when I kiss you, you try to
shove me out the door. What's--?

01:09:42.415 --> 01:09:43.814
What's going on?

01:09:45.718 --> 01:09:48.209
Don't you care about me at all,
Johnny?

01:09:48.421 --> 01:09:52.482
You know you can talk to me.
You can tell me anything.

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:55.590
Please.

01:09:58.531 --> 01:10:00.055
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:05.030
Try me.

01:10:05.238 --> 01:10:06.762
You'll think I'm crazy.

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.573
Maybe I am crazy.

01:10:08.774 --> 01:10:09.968
I hope I'm crazy.

01:10:10.176 --> 01:10:13.441
In my job, I've seen and heard
just about everything.

01:10:13.813 --> 01:10:17.180
So there is nothing you can tell me
that's gonna surprise me.

01:10:18.151 --> 01:10:19.277
Off the record?

01:10:20.586 --> 01:10:21.746
Yeah.

01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:36.301
I sold my soul to the devil.

01:10:43.676 --> 01:10:45.769
And now I have to spare you.

01:10:47.813 --> 01:10:48.905
Spare me from what?

01:10:49.115 --> 01:10:51.379
The devil,
on account of I work for him.

01:10:51.584 --> 01:10:53.779
That's why I couldn't make it to dinner.

01:10:55.588 --> 01:10:57.988
Because you were
working for the devil?

01:10:58.191 --> 01:11:00.216
Well, yeah. I'm his bounty hunter.

01:11:00.426 --> 01:11:03.953
But it only happens at night,
like it is right now.

01:11:04.163 --> 01:11:05.425
Whenever I'm around evil.

01:11:05.631 --> 01:11:10.796
Evil people, evil spirits.
I change into...

01:11:12.438 --> 01:11:13.496
What?

01:11:14.707 --> 01:11:19.667
Just a great big monster,
but I am learning to--

01:11:19.879 --> 01:11:22.074
I'm getting control of it.

01:11:22.281 --> 01:11:23.714
I'm trying to.

01:11:25.751 --> 01:11:28.151
So tonight, you'll...

01:11:30.656 --> 01:11:31.816
I believe so.

01:11:32.024 --> 01:11:35.482
Which is why it's probably
a very good idea...

01:11:36.562 --> 01:11:39.030
...that you run on home now, Roxie.

01:11:43.236 --> 01:11:44.533
You're serious.

01:11:49.342 --> 01:11:52.539
So this is your excuse?

01:11:52.845 --> 01:11:56.941
For the past? For last night?
For everything?

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:10.391
The way I see it is
I've got a couple of choices:

01:12:11.664 --> 01:12:15.794
I could either accept that you really
believe what you're telling me is true...

01:12:16.002 --> 01:12:18.470
...and take you to
the nearest psychiatric hospital.

01:12:18.671 --> 01:12:19.660
You see, now that--

01:12:19.872 --> 01:12:24.070
Or I realize that you'd rather
make up ridiculous stories...

01:12:24.277 --> 01:12:26.177
...than be honest with me...

01:12:26.979 --> 01:12:29.379
...and I walk out of that door...

01:12:29.682 --> 01:12:30.910
...forever.

01:12:57.576 --> 01:12:58.702
- Don't move!
- Hands up!

01:12:58.911 --> 01:13:02.005
Hands where we can see them!
Right over your head.

01:13:02.581 --> 01:13:03.946
Johnny Blaze.

01:13:05.318 --> 01:13:06.512
Yeah.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.349
Captain Jack Dolan.
This is Officer Edwards.

01:13:12.525 --> 01:13:13.753
You're coming with us.

01:13:15.828 --> 01:13:17.090
Okay.

01:13:22.401 --> 01:13:24.130
<i>Let's try this again.</i>

01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:28.262
We have your plate and the tread
from your tires at the crime scene.

01:13:28.474 --> 01:13:30.738
We have a witness who will testify...

01:13:30.943 --> 01:13:33.411
...that the suspect
used some kind of fire effect.

01:13:33.612 --> 01:13:36.638
An effect just like the ones
that you use in your stunt shows!

01:13:36.849 --> 01:13:41.047
Yeah. But I told you,
I didn't kill anybody.

01:13:49.161 --> 01:13:52.255
- What about him, you remember him?
- No.

01:13:52.531 --> 01:13:54.362
This guy was three years
from retirement...

01:13:54.567 --> 01:13:55.898
...never harmed a fly.

01:13:56.102 --> 01:13:58.468
In fact, neither did
most of the corpses turning up...

01:13:58.671 --> 01:14:00.935
...since you came home,
you son of a bitch.

01:14:02.108 --> 01:14:04.406
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Bullshit!

01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:06.168
Okay, let's take a breather.

01:14:09.081 --> 01:14:10.878
- It's warm in here.
- Warm?

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:12.880
Yeah, I'm burning up. Aren't you?

01:14:13.085 --> 01:14:14.279
A little.

01:14:17.022 --> 01:14:18.387
You want a cigarette?

01:14:18.924 --> 01:14:20.016
Okay.

01:14:20.826 --> 01:14:22.384
Mind if I do?

01:14:27.967 --> 01:14:29.093
Okay, that was weird.

01:14:32.338 --> 01:14:35.569
Look, Johnny,
I'm not asking for your help.

01:14:35.908 --> 01:14:38.809
I'm asking you to help yourself.

01:14:39.979 --> 01:14:42.573
I watch a lot of TV
and I know what you're doing.

01:14:43.082 --> 01:14:46.745
Good cop, bad cop.
But you're both good cops.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.422
And you provide
a very, very important civil service.

01:14:51.624 --> 01:14:53.489
In fact, when I finish my stunt career...

01:14:53.692 --> 01:14:57.128
...I intend to apply my skills
to being a motorcycle policeman.

01:14:57.329 --> 01:15:00.821
So I'd love to help you.
But I didn't kill anybody.

01:15:01.534 --> 01:15:03.661
Jesus Christ.

01:15:03.869 --> 01:15:06.997
Who you trying to convince, Johnny?
Us or yourself?

01:15:07.206 --> 01:15:08.969
We're trying to help you here.

01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:12.201
We're trying to keep this thing quiet.

01:15:12.411 --> 01:15:15.812
Yeah, because I imagine that
your fans wouldn't be too keen...

01:15:16.015 --> 01:15:19.416
...on you being wrapped up
in a homicide investigation.

01:15:19.618 --> 01:15:24.146
Not to mention all those
corporate sponsors, event promoters...

01:15:27.426 --> 01:15:30.623
You ready to talk now, Johnny?

01:15:32.565 --> 01:15:34.590
Or do you want to spend
the night in the tank?

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.961
Oh, I don't wanna do that.

01:15:37.436 --> 01:15:40.803
No, sir. I sure don't wanna do that.

01:15:43.943 --> 01:15:46.002
But I didn't kill anybody.

01:15:47.379 --> 01:15:48.471
Damn it!

01:15:50.516 --> 01:15:53.485
You gotta let me go.
The real killer's out there.

01:15:54.487 --> 01:15:56.978
- Lookie here.
- But you're making a mistake.

01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:58.486
What've we got?

01:15:59.225 --> 01:16:01.216
Come on, move your ass!

01:16:06.432 --> 01:16:07.763
Blaze, riding up to meet us.

01:16:07.967 --> 01:16:11.300
Oh, God. Oh, please. Please,
you don't wanna put me in there.

01:16:11.504 --> 01:16:13.096
Sorry, the Ritz was booked.

01:16:19.044 --> 01:16:21.740
Oh, God.
Please, get me out of here!

01:16:24.617 --> 01:16:26.414
You look like that Johnny Blaze.

01:16:27.052 --> 01:16:30.852
Yeah, yeah, I hear that a lot.

01:16:31.423 --> 01:16:32.856
Nah, that is you.

01:16:33.058 --> 01:16:34.958
- That's him!
- Yeah, it is.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:38.357
I saw you jump in the state fair
a few years ago.

01:16:38.564 --> 01:16:41.260
I paid 10 bucks to watch you splatter.

01:16:43.802 --> 01:16:45.167
But you didn't.

01:16:45.371 --> 01:16:47.168
Looks like somebody's tripping out.

01:16:47.506 --> 01:16:49.474
You might be a big shot
out there, Blaze...

01:16:49.675 --> 01:16:52.405
...but in here you're nothing
but a monkey in a cage!

01:16:52.611 --> 01:16:54.602
Now, I don't want any trouble.

01:16:54.813 --> 01:16:56.678
I don't want any trouble.

01:16:56.882 --> 01:16:59.146
Looks like trouble just found you.

01:17:00.786 --> 01:17:02.617
Nice jacket.

01:17:03.422 --> 01:17:04.855
Come on, man, leave him alone.

01:17:05.057 --> 01:17:06.024
Get lost!

01:17:06.225 --> 01:17:08.386
- The jacket's mine.
- Stop it!

01:17:43.228 --> 01:17:45.059
Nice jacket.

01:17:47.399 --> 01:17:49.128
Very nice.

01:18:08.988 --> 01:18:10.080
You.

01:18:12.458 --> 01:18:13.618
Innocent.

01:18:45.324 --> 01:18:48.953
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:18:51.764 --> 01:18:53.391
I've sinned a lot.

01:19:16.822 --> 01:19:17.914
Hold it!

01:19:54.993 --> 01:19:57.086
Where's the contract
of San Venganza?

01:19:57.296 --> 01:19:59.230
I don't know
what you are talking about.

01:19:59.431 --> 01:20:04.698
Don't lie to me! You've been protecting
it all these years, sworn to secrecy.

01:20:04.903 --> 01:20:07.064
Sworn to keep it
from the likes of you!

01:20:10.676 --> 01:20:12.439
There's an old saying:

01:20:12.878 --> 01:20:15.745
"Raise no more devils
than you can lay down."

01:20:15.948 --> 01:20:18.280
My father raised one too many.

01:20:26.158 --> 01:20:28.683
<i>Calling all units. Reported 10-50
in the downtown area.</i>

01:20:28.894 --> 01:20:29.883
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

01:21:30.923 --> 01:21:32.356
He's coming for us.

01:21:32.758 --> 01:21:34.055
Abigor.

01:21:34.927 --> 01:21:36.189
You know what to do.

01:21:45.704 --> 01:21:48.298
<i>Rider.</i>

01:22:12.965 --> 01:22:16.833
I have a suspect fleeing west
on Cherry. Repeat, west on Cherry.

01:22:18.503 --> 01:22:20.994
<i>- That's a dead end. You got him.
- 10-4 on that.</i>

01:22:27.446 --> 01:22:28.936
<i>What's the suspect's location?</i>

01:22:29.147 --> 01:22:30.375
<i>- Up.
- What?</i>

01:22:30.582 --> 01:22:33.449
The suspect is going up.

01:22:53.138 --> 01:22:54.537
Oh, my God.

01:23:08.654 --> 01:23:09.951
People, help me.

01:23:10.188 --> 01:23:11.553
Go, go, go!

01:23:11.757 --> 01:23:14.658
Surround him!
Make a perimeter! Let's go!

01:23:26.038 --> 01:23:27.528
<i>Come in, please.</i>

01:23:41.153 --> 01:23:43.348
- Come here!
- No!

01:23:44.056 --> 01:23:45.921
You're pissing me off.

01:23:46.458 --> 01:23:47.857
Okay, okay.

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:49.254
Sorry.

01:24:00.806 --> 01:24:02.103
Take a right.

01:24:10.916 --> 01:24:12.850
You should've joined us, Rider.

01:24:13.051 --> 01:24:14.575
Soon we will have the contract...

01:24:14.786 --> 01:24:18.745
...and then you'll only be a footnote
in the history of the new hell.

01:24:22.728 --> 01:24:24.753
Time to clear the air.

01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:39.836
You're a slow learner,
aren't you, Rider?

01:24:41.446 --> 01:24:43.414
You cannot catch the wind!

01:24:54.826 --> 01:24:58.125
No!

01:25:32.831 --> 01:25:34.128
Oh, my God.

01:26:09.668 --> 01:26:11.033
Johnny.

01:26:17.542 --> 01:26:18.975
Prepare to fire!

01:26:22.481 --> 01:26:23.709
- Fire!
- Don't!

01:27:30.081 --> 01:27:31.309
They know who I am.

01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:34.612
- Who's that?
- What? Everybody.

01:27:34.986 --> 01:27:37.045
You don't watch TV?
What's the matter with you?

01:27:41.092 --> 01:27:42.821
Is this thing ever gonna end?

01:27:43.028 --> 01:27:45.087
It'll end if you can catch him.

01:27:45.497 --> 01:27:46.896
What's really going on?

01:28:08.119 --> 01:28:10.747
- Anything good on?
- How can I help you, captain?

01:28:10.956 --> 01:28:12.389
Get out.

01:28:13.858 --> 01:28:16.520
We brought a friend of yours
in for questioning last night...

01:28:16.728 --> 01:28:19.492
...and now he seems
to have disappeared.

01:28:19.698 --> 01:28:22.633
Has Johnny Blaze tried
to contact you in any way, ma'am?

01:28:22.834 --> 01:28:24.927
Sorry. Can't help, guys.

01:28:29.307 --> 01:28:33.437
Look, I don't pretend to know
what the hell that thing is...

01:28:33.645 --> 01:28:36.079
...but I do know that Blaze
is wrapped up in it.

01:28:36.281 --> 01:28:40.911
And the only way you can save him
now is if you help us find him.

01:28:42.687 --> 01:28:47.215
You got six hours. After that we go
public with everything we got.

01:28:48.426 --> 01:28:49.791
Six hours.

01:29:04.676 --> 01:29:06.303
"Carter Slade."

01:29:07.345 --> 01:29:11.805
Legend has it he was
a Texas Ranger. Man of honor.

01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:14.978
But he got greedy.

01:29:15.387 --> 01:29:19.949
Found himself locked up,
waiting on the gallows.

01:29:20.659 --> 01:29:22.524
Stranger came to see him.

01:29:23.061 --> 01:29:24.756
Offering freedom.

01:29:25.797 --> 01:29:27.594
Slade made a deal.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.231
Ended up a Ghost Rider.

01:29:30.835 --> 01:29:32.530
What's he gotta do with this?

01:29:32.871 --> 01:29:34.805
Remember that contract
the stranger made...

01:29:35.006 --> 01:29:37.167
...with the people of San Venganza?

01:29:37.742 --> 01:29:42.042
The story goes that Slade
was sent there to collect all the souls.

01:29:43.148 --> 01:29:45.878
But what he found there was so evil...

01:29:46.084 --> 01:29:49.485
...that he took the contract
and rode off.

01:29:49.988 --> 01:29:51.649
He stole it.

01:29:52.023 --> 01:29:54.890
Keep Mephistopheles
from getting his hands on it.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.490
Some people say
he was buried with it.

01:29:58.697 --> 01:30:00.892
- Was he?
- I don't know.

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:06.969
What I do know is that Blackheart is
coming, and he'll do anything to get it.

01:30:07.505 --> 01:30:11.441
That's why it's important for you to
stay away from friends and family...

01:30:11.643 --> 01:30:14.441
...anybody he can use against you,
because he will.

01:30:14.946 --> 01:30:15.913
Roxanne.

01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:28.319
Johnny?

01:30:34.532 --> 01:30:35.726
Johnny?

01:30:35.967 --> 01:30:37.127
God!

01:30:38.937 --> 01:30:40.268
Sorry! Sorry!

01:30:40.705 --> 01:30:42.036
Ma'am, you gave me a start.

01:30:42.774 --> 01:30:46.141
- I'm looking for Johnny.
- Yeah. You and me both.

01:30:46.945 --> 01:30:48.742
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

01:30:48.947 --> 01:30:50.881
But I heard he got in trouble.

01:30:52.217 --> 01:30:55.015
He got arrested, yeah? What for?

01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:59.147
Yeah, well, if this gets out in
the press, his career is over.

01:30:59.357 --> 01:31:02.121
Yeah, trust me, his career's
the least of it.

01:31:02.527 --> 01:31:05.394
You know, you seem like a nice lady,
and you're pretty and all...

01:31:05.597 --> 01:31:08.122
...but we were riding the gravy train
on biscuit wheels...

01:31:08.333 --> 01:31:10.358
...then you showed up,
everything went to hell.

01:31:10.568 --> 01:31:13.162
So why don't you go back
to wherever it is you came from?

01:31:14.172 --> 01:31:16.640
I can't go back. Not now.

01:31:17.575 --> 01:31:19.475
Then tell me what the hell's going on!

01:31:20.245 --> 01:31:22.713
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

01:31:23.348 --> 01:31:25.976
Look, you don't know me...

01:31:26.184 --> 01:31:27.310
...but I love him.

01:31:27.519 --> 01:31:31.819
So if there's anything you know
that can help, anything...

01:31:34.793 --> 01:31:37.387
Lately, he's been reading
these really weird books...

01:31:37.595 --> 01:31:39.290
...and they're messing with his mind.

01:31:39.497 --> 01:31:41.872
He's writing stuff down
and staying up late.

01:31:41.873 --> 01:31:43.297
And he does it over here.

01:31:43.501 --> 01:31:46.595
You can go through this stuff,
and I don't know if it means anything.

01:32:38.756 --> 01:32:40.849
This is hallowed ground.

01:32:50.001 --> 01:32:52.128
Did you think I was like
the others?

01:32:53.037 --> 01:32:57.303
I have all of my father's strengths
and none of his weaknesses.

01:32:59.077 --> 01:33:01.671
The new hell is in San Venganza.

01:33:02.947 --> 01:33:04.881
I need the contract.

01:33:05.416 --> 01:33:07.316
I know it's here.

01:33:13.224 --> 01:33:15.089
Now give it to me.

01:33:25.203 --> 01:33:27.228
Give it to me.

01:33:28.706 --> 01:33:30.571
Give it to me.

01:33:30.775 --> 01:33:33.539
Give it to me. Give it to me.
Give it to me.

01:33:48.893 --> 01:33:50.861
You're gonna fall.

01:33:51.462 --> 01:33:53.521
Just like your father.

01:34:20.058 --> 01:34:23.255
The Rider, where is he?

01:34:23.728 --> 01:34:25.161
Gone!

01:34:30.535 --> 01:34:31.627
The girl.

01:34:32.003 --> 01:34:35.632
You hurt her, he'll be there
like lightning before the storm.

01:34:38.876 --> 01:34:40.434
I'm counting on it.

01:34:48.186 --> 01:34:49.278
Where's Roxanne?

01:34:49.487 --> 01:34:51.648
Dude. Where've you been?
Everybody's out looking--

01:34:51.856 --> 01:34:54.916
- Where is she?
- She's out looking for you.

01:35:14.012 --> 01:35:15.138
Jesus.

01:35:15.346 --> 01:35:16.745
Not even close.

01:35:24.989 --> 01:35:26.547
You have his heart.

01:35:31.929 --> 01:35:33.760
Now I'm gonna break it.

01:35:36.367 --> 01:35:37.334
Roxanne?

01:35:42.974 --> 01:35:44.100
Mack.

01:35:47.011 --> 01:35:47.978
Roxanne.

01:35:57.121 --> 01:35:59.180
Look into my eyes.

01:36:06.464 --> 01:36:08.898
Your Penance Stare
doesn't work on me.

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.500
I have no soul to burn.

01:36:12.904 --> 01:36:15.873
I guess the Caretaker
forgot to mention that, huh?

01:36:16.307 --> 01:36:17.535
Surprise!

01:36:18.276 --> 01:36:19.971
He sent you to bring me back.

01:36:20.645 --> 01:36:22.476
I'm not going back.

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.511
I like it here.

01:36:27.952 --> 01:36:29.715
He thinks you're better than me?

01:36:29.921 --> 01:36:33.118
I don't know who's more pathetic,
you or him.

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:40.156
Now, listen to me. And try to get it
through that thick skull of yours.

01:36:40.364 --> 01:36:43.822
You don't work for my father anymore.
You work for me.

01:36:44.202 --> 01:36:46.397
Get the contract from the Caretaker.

01:36:46.604 --> 01:36:51.564
Bring it to me in San Venganza
and maybe I'll spare your girl's life.

01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:53.609
And, Johnny...

01:36:58.516 --> 01:37:00.040
...don't make me wait.

01:37:18.936 --> 01:37:20.528
What happened?

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.538
- Blackheart.
- They got her.

01:37:24.809 --> 01:37:27.277
Where's the contract?
I can't end this without it.

01:37:30.515 --> 01:37:33.484
Just gonna have to dig
this whole damn place up myself.

01:37:36.454 --> 01:37:37.785
It's not there, kid.

01:37:49.934 --> 01:37:51.959
Contract of San Venganza.

01:37:52.336 --> 01:37:53.803
Hell on earth.

01:37:56.274 --> 01:37:58.139
Now, you're gonna have to trust me.

01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:00.375
And why is that?

01:38:01.612 --> 01:38:03.580
He may have my soul...

01:38:04.982 --> 01:38:06.745
...but he doesn't have my spirit.

01:38:12.957 --> 01:38:16.723
Any man who's got the guts
to sell his soul for love...

01:38:17.028 --> 01:38:19.360
...got the power to change the world.

01:38:20.264 --> 01:38:22.061
You didn't do it for greed.

01:38:22.834 --> 01:38:24.825
You did it for the right reason.

01:38:25.703 --> 01:38:27.671
Maybe that puts God on your side.

01:38:28.506 --> 01:38:30.667
To him, that makes you dangerous.

01:38:30.875 --> 01:38:32.809
Makes you unpredictable.

01:38:33.511 --> 01:38:35.911
That's the best thing
you can be right now.

01:38:38.816 --> 01:38:41.910
San Venganza's 500 miles from here.

01:38:43.287 --> 01:38:44.914
We better get moving.

01:38:47.358 --> 01:38:48.552
"We"?

01:39:10.681 --> 01:39:13.206
I got one last ride left in me.

01:39:25.029 --> 01:39:26.553
Carter Slade.

01:39:30.768 --> 01:39:32.235
Can you keep up?

01:39:41.045 --> 01:39:42.535
Let's ride.

01:40:27.158 --> 01:40:29.285
Stick to the shadows.

01:40:47.278 --> 01:40:49.746
This is the end of the trail for me.

01:40:50.348 --> 01:40:52.111
I got nothing left.

01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:56.616
I could only change one more time,
and I was saving it for this.

01:41:01.325 --> 01:41:04.294
God knows I've made
my share of mistakes.

01:41:05.496 --> 01:41:08.226
Been trying to make things right
ever since.

01:41:09.633 --> 01:41:14.127
Guess all I can do now is hope he
sees fit to give me a second chance.

01:41:14.905 --> 01:41:16.065
Thank you.

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.964
No.

01:41:18.242 --> 01:41:19.766
Thank you, kid.

01:41:35.559 --> 01:41:37.527
The Rider is coming.

01:41:38.529 --> 01:41:41.157
Coming to save you.

01:41:42.133 --> 01:41:45.193
You think you can stop him?
Nothing can stop him.

01:41:45.770 --> 01:41:47.829
He's running out of time.

01:41:48.639 --> 01:41:49.867
I'll make sure of it.

01:41:54.211 --> 01:41:57.339
It's almost dawn. Slow him down.

01:41:59.350 --> 01:42:05.084
- What?
- Slow him down.

01:43:21.866 --> 01:43:23.026
Surprise.

01:44:37.675 --> 01:44:38.801
Stop.

01:44:39.009 --> 01:44:41.307
You change, she dies.

01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:43.747
Do it, Johnny.

01:44:52.089 --> 01:44:53.454
Let her go first.

01:45:50.748 --> 01:45:52.375
Looks like you're out of time.

01:46:24.214 --> 01:46:27.206
"This is the contract of San Venganza.

01:46:30.821 --> 01:46:32.254
All of you...

01:46:32.923 --> 01:46:35.551
...come to me!"

01:47:31.482 --> 01:47:32.608
Johnny!

01:47:46.997 --> 01:47:50.626
My name is Legion...

01:47:52.236 --> 01:47:54.067
...for we are...

01:47:55.439 --> 01:47:59.466
...many.

01:48:00.844 --> 01:48:03.472
Let's go. He got what he wanted.

01:48:05.883 --> 01:48:10.343
You go. I gotta get him to
the shadows. I gotta end this.

01:48:11.155 --> 01:48:12.918
Why? Why you?

01:48:13.123 --> 01:48:15.956
It's been me since the day
I made the deal.

01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:19.061
I'm the only one
who can walk in both worlds.

01:48:19.596 --> 01:48:21.063
I'm Ghost Rider.

01:48:25.569 --> 01:48:26.536
Run!

01:48:37.214 --> 01:48:38.442
Come on, you son of a bitch.

01:49:01.271 --> 01:49:02.533
All of your world...

01:49:02.739 --> 01:49:04.570
...all of your souls...

01:49:04.775 --> 01:49:07.403
...will be mine now.

01:49:21.825 --> 01:49:23.520
- Throw me the gun!
- It's out!

01:49:25.128 --> 01:49:26.254
Throw it!

01:50:24.688 --> 01:50:28.055
How does it feel to have
all that evil inside of you?

01:50:28.258 --> 01:50:29.657
All their power.

01:50:30.827 --> 01:50:32.795
All their souls.

01:50:33.697 --> 01:50:36.131
A thousand souls to burn.

01:50:36.333 --> 01:50:38.893
Look into my eyes.

01:50:39.102 --> 01:50:42.629
Your souls are stained
by the blood of the innocent.

01:50:42.839 --> 01:50:44.670
No.

01:50:44.875 --> 01:50:46.467
Feel their pain.

01:50:57.754 --> 01:51:00.086
--Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:01.450
Kill you!

01:51:05.095 --> 01:51:06.289
Stop it!

01:51:08.832 --> 01:51:10.060
Oh, God!

01:51:50.574 --> 01:51:51.973
Monster.

01:51:53.410 --> 01:51:54.934
I'm not afraid.

01:52:20.037 --> 01:52:22.164
Congratulations, Johnny.

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:26.108
You upheld your end of the bargain.

01:52:27.544 --> 01:52:30.707
It's time I take back
the power of the Ghost Rider.

01:52:31.848 --> 01:52:33.645
You get your life back.

01:52:34.584 --> 01:52:36.449
The love you've always wanted.

01:52:36.887 --> 01:52:39.321
You can start a family of your own.

01:52:40.357 --> 01:52:42.518
There are more deals to be made.

01:52:43.026 --> 01:52:47.554
More people willing to give their souls
for what they desire.

01:52:48.031 --> 01:52:51.831
Let someone else carry this curse.
You're free now.

01:52:53.136 --> 01:52:54.603
After all...

01:52:55.372 --> 01:52:57.237
...a deal's a deal.

01:53:10.253 --> 01:53:11.220
No.

01:53:13.123 --> 01:53:15.591
I'm gonna own this curse...

01:53:16.893 --> 01:53:19.361
...and I'm gonna use it against you.

01:53:20.263 --> 01:53:22.857
Whenever innocent blood is spilt...

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:25.766
...it'll be my father's blood...

01:53:27.504 --> 01:53:29.699
...and you'll find me there.

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:32.401
A spirit of vengeance...

01:53:33.243 --> 01:53:36.178
...fighting fire with fire.

01:53:37.614 --> 01:53:40.310
I will make you pay for this.

01:53:41.284 --> 01:53:43.252
You can't live in fear.

01:53:45.322 --> 01:53:47.415
No!

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:13.080
So where will you go now?

01:54:14.384 --> 01:54:16.852
Wherever the road takes me, I guess.

01:54:20.824 --> 01:54:24.760
My daddy once said, "If you don't
make a choice, the choice makes you."

01:54:25.195 --> 01:54:29.359
Yeah. But why do your choices
always keep us apart?

01:54:43.346 --> 01:54:45.473
Sure wish things could have
turned out different.

01:54:47.083 --> 01:54:50.052
No. This is what you are.

01:54:50.253 --> 01:54:52.881
This is what
you always were meant to be.

01:54:53.657 --> 01:54:55.124
You got your second chance.

01:54:55.926 --> 01:54:57.985
Go out there and make the best of it.

01:55:26.523 --> 01:55:30.084
<i>It's said that the West
was built on legends...</i>

01:55:31.394 --> 01:55:33.919
<i>...and that legends are
a way of understanding...</i>

01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:36.690
<i>...things greater than ourselves.</i>

01:55:37.067 --> 01:55:39.331
<i>Forces that shape our lives.</i>

01:55:39.536 --> 01:55:42.903
<i>Events that defy explanation.</i>

01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.703
<i>Individuals whose lives
soar to the heavens...</i>

01:55:47.911 --> 01:55:49.879
<i>...or fall to the earth.</i>

01:55:50.347 --> 01:55:53.839
<i>This is how legends are born.</i>
