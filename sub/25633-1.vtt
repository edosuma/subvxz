01:09.752 --> 01:12.553
All right, buddy, sit down.

01:12.555 --> 01:14.589
You ready?

01:14.591 --> 01:17.458
Let's do your arm.

01:17.460 --> 01:20.160
You want to count with me?

01:20.162 --> 01:21.628
Okay.

01:21.630 --> 01:24.499
One... two...

01:24.501 --> 01:27.235
three... four...

03:08.572 --> 03:10.705
You need to go
to the bathroom, buddy?

03:15.612 --> 03:17.645
Just being
your own best friend?

03:21.618 --> 03:23.754
Good night, Jonah.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.496
Hey, did you bring Sarah
her inhaler?

03:35.498 --> 03:37.699
Yeah. And you, uh...

03:37.701 --> 03:39.566
brushed Jonah?

03:39.568 --> 03:41.236
Yup.

03:41.238 --> 03:42.570
Great.

03:42.572 --> 03:44.706
Don't forget we're going
to my brother's

03:44.708 --> 03:47.242
tomorrow night for dinner.

03:47.244 --> 03:48.909
Craig hates me.

03:48.911 --> 03:50.378
He doesn't hate you.

03:50.380 --> 03:52.279
His factory setting
is "asshole."

03:52.281 --> 03:55.516
You think he's going to respect
me more now I got promoted?

03:55.518 --> 03:57.684
Nope.

03:57.686 --> 03:59.687
But I'm sure
he's really excited

03:59.689 --> 04:01.655
to show us his new G-Wagon.

04:01.657 --> 04:04.325
It's sick, dude.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.760
Yeah.

04:05.762 --> 04:08.762
It's matte black,
just like Justin Bieber's.

04:08.764 --> 04:11.434
I'm 41.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.808
<i>Mom, I can't find my books.</i>

04:20.810 --> 04:23.010
<i>Sarah, go put your shoes on.</i>

04:23.012 --> 04:24.678
Jonah. Jonah.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.513
We're not playing a game
right now, okay?

04:26.515 --> 04:28.683
Jonah, give me this foot.
This foot, right in there.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.051
Not banana feet. Come on.

04:30.053 --> 04:31.952
- Right here.
- I still can't find it!

04:31.954 --> 04:34.055
Sarah, look in my bedroom!
You left it in my bed!

04:34.057 --> 04:35.722
Oh, my... Just hold still.

04:35.724 --> 04:37.727
- Hold still. Hold still!
- Ow!

04:49.973 --> 04:51.938
This is not our lot.

04:51.940 --> 04:53.907
- What?
- Go to the other parking lot.

04:53.909 --> 04:55.909
No, no, no, honey,
the other lot is full.

04:55.911 --> 04:57.779
We have to park here
today, okay?

04:57.781 --> 05:00.748
- Other lot.
- Not again.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.517
Other lot. Other lot.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.419
- Other lot. Other lot.
- Jonah, I have to meet with Mrs. Bell.

05:05.421 --> 05:07.020
- Other lot! Other lot!
- Like, three minutes ago.

05:07.022 --> 05:08.690
- Jonah, don't! - Other lot!
- Let's just park here, okay?

05:08.692 --> 05:09.825
- Other lot!
- Jonah, please?

05:09.827 --> 05:11.726
- Other lot! Other lot!
- I have to meet with Mrs. Bell

05:11.728 --> 05:13.094
- No, no, no!
- three minutes ago!

05:13.096 --> 05:15.330
- No, no, no! No, no, no!
- Let's just park here!

05:15.332 --> 05:17.431
- Mom, make him stop!
- Other lot, Mama!

05:17.433 --> 05:19.334
- Other lot!
- You know how he gets with his routine.

05:19.336 --> 05:20.734
- Other lot!
- He doesn't like it when we do things diff...

05:20.736 --> 05:22.637
Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

05:22.639 --> 05:25.806
The other lot is full!
Let's just park here.

05:25.808 --> 05:27.674
- No! No!
- Jonah!

05:39.488 --> 05:41.325
You happy now?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.465
Come on.

05:49.733 --> 05:51.368
Come on.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.471
Hi.

05:56.473 --> 05:57.637
Hi, Laurie.

05:57.639 --> 05:59.507
Sorry I'm so late.

05:59.509 --> 06:01.875
Regent was backed up
for blocks.

06:01.877 --> 06:03.945
- Hi, Marlo.
- Hi.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.512
Oh. Are you
on maternity leave yet?

06:05.514 --> 06:07.048
You look like
you're about to pop.

06:07.050 --> 06:10.118
- Yeah, Friday was my last day.
- Wow.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.887
- Such a blessing.
- Yes.

06:12.889 --> 06:14.888
Well, I hate to sound
like a broken record,

06:14.890 --> 06:16.957
but I need to talk to you
about Jonah.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.560
Miss Marvish tells me
that he is still having

06:19.562 --> 06:21.928
a really tough time in class,
and now we're starting

06:21.930 --> 06:23.998
to get worried about
his emotional development.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.868
Well, kindergarten
is a tough transition.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.906
But... it's April.

06:29.805 --> 06:31.406
That's true, yeah.

06:31.408 --> 06:33.707
And he's about to have
a really big disruption

06:33.709 --> 06:36.447
in his life, too.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.981
- The... Oh, yes. Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.984
- Yeah.
- No, I have thought about all of that.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.919
Right, and look,
Jonah's a sweetheart.

06:44.921 --> 06:46.686
We love him.

06:46.688 --> 06:50.424
But as you know, he's an...
out-of-the-box kid.

06:50.426 --> 06:52.560
He's... quirky.

06:52.562 --> 06:54.962
And there are 24 other children
in the class,

06:54.964 --> 06:57.097
and it's not fair to them
that Jonah needs

06:57.099 --> 06:59.099
so much of the teacher's time.

06:59.101 --> 07:01.101
- No. It's not fair. You should know,
- Yeah.

07:01.103 --> 07:03.104
we've been working through
the meltdowns at home.

07:03.106 --> 07:04.572
- Good.
- He's doing much better.

07:04.574 --> 07:06.606
And doing this new therapy
on him that...

07:06.608 --> 07:09.577
We think that Jonah could
benefit from a one-to-one aide.

07:09.579 --> 07:11.645
That's a teacher
that's there just for him,

07:11.647 --> 07:13.013
who shadows him during the day,

07:13.015 --> 07:15.715
and gives him all
the extra support he requires.

07:15.717 --> 07:17.084
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

07:17.086 --> 07:19.654
And so that aide
is here on staff?

07:19.656 --> 07:21.625
No, we don't provide aides.

07:25.127 --> 07:28.496
So I have to go out
and get aides all by myself?

07:28.498 --> 07:30.166
Yes, you'd need
to hire this person.

07:31.099 --> 07:33.469
I'm paying for aides?

07:34.503 --> 07:36.871
One aide.
He just needs one aide.

07:38.106 --> 07:40.707
Okay. I'll figure that out.

07:40.709 --> 07:42.909
Anyway, we don't normally make
these kind of accommodations

07:42.911 --> 07:45.746
for students at Saint V's,
but we love your family, so...

07:45.748 --> 07:48.149
- Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

07:48.151 --> 07:50.051
- This is gonna be great.
- Yeah.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.019
- Yeah.
- Have a great day, okay?

07:52.021 --> 07:53.520
- Thank you. You, too.
- You're welcome.

07:53.522 --> 07:55.022
- All right, bye-bye.
- Bye.

07:58.127 --> 07:59.930
Next.

08:01.897 --> 08:03.798
Can I, um...

08:03.800 --> 08:06.601
All right, let me just get
a decaf skim latte.

08:06.603 --> 08:08.602
Uh, you know there are

08:08.604 --> 08:11.839
trace amounts of caffeine
even in decaf, right?

08:11.841 --> 08:13.541
Huh?

08:13.543 --> 08:15.609
Oh, this. Yeah.

08:15.611 --> 08:17.046
Just so you know.

08:17.947 --> 08:19.983
You still want it?

08:20.884 --> 08:22.186
Yeah.

08:23.820 --> 08:27.221
And a muffin.

08:36.565 --> 08:38.201
Marlo?

08:39.602 --> 08:40.967
Vy?

08:40.969 --> 08:42.770
Oh.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.105
Hey.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.543
What are you doing out here?

08:47.977 --> 08:51.545
Um... I'm in town
for a friend's memorial.

08:51.547 --> 08:54.582
- Yeah, her dad passed away.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

08:54.584 --> 08:56.884
No, don't be.
He's a dick.

08:59.022 --> 09:01.789
What are you doing here?
You live here now?

09:01.791 --> 09:02.923
Yeah.

09:02.925 --> 09:04.728
Two kids.

09:05.994 --> 09:08.698
Nothing's changed.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.567
Yeah.

09:12.569 --> 09:14.735
Well, I should go,
I should get this coffee home

09:14.737 --> 09:17.837
before it gets
as cold and black as my womb.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.108
You still got my number?

09:22.110 --> 09:24.245
I have a old number.

09:24.247 --> 09:26.246
Yeah, it's the same one.

09:26.248 --> 09:28.249
I'm still on Bushwick.

09:28.251 --> 09:30.985
You still live at the loft?

09:30.987 --> 09:33.821
Yeah. You should
call me sometime.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.592
- Yeah.
- Okay?

09:57.747 --> 10:00.347
Hey, are you guys excited
to see your cousins?

10:00.349 --> 10:02.283
- Yeah.
- Is the dog gonna be out?

10:02.285 --> 10:04.150
Jonah, buddy.

10:04.152 --> 10:06.153
That dog can't hurt you...
he's, like, two pounds.

10:06.155 --> 10:08.755
What is that dog's name again?

10:08.757 --> 10:10.627
Prosecco.

10:11.893 --> 10:13.894
I wanna kill myself.

10:13.896 --> 10:15.663
What?

10:15.665 --> 10:18.899
No, Mommy's joking,
honey, like a clown.

10:18.901 --> 10:20.900
Honk, honk.

10:30.647 --> 10:33.246
You all right?

10:33.248 --> 10:35.649
Is that Uncle Craig's new car?

10:35.651 --> 10:37.651
Yeah, that's a G-Wagon.

10:37.653 --> 10:39.419
- Can we get one?
- Nope.

10:39.421 --> 10:42.122
You wouldn't want one.
They catch fire all the time.

10:42.124 --> 10:43.790
Mommy's joking again.

10:43.792 --> 10:46.360
Yeah, that's why
it's all black like that.

10:46.362 --> 10:49.230
- Probably caught fire already.
- You're lying.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.765
Don't get too close.

10:54.336 --> 10:55.870
Hey!

10:55.872 --> 10:58.271
- Hey!
- Sarah, I'm gonna steal those boots

10:58.273 --> 11:00.341
right off your feet...
they're so cute.

11:00.343 --> 11:01.842
- Hey, Elyse.
- Hey.

11:01.844 --> 11:03.843
Hi, guys.
We made an obstacle course

11:03.845 --> 11:06.179
in the playroom if you want
to come check it out.

11:06.181 --> 11:07.414
This is Shasta, our nanny.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.082
- Hi.
- We've got karaoke.

11:09.084 --> 11:11.151
Yeah. We got a karaoke machine.

11:11.153 --> 11:13.888
- Cool!
- All right.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.423
Shasta's so awesome.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.458
She has a master's degree
in early childhood education.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.961
I feel like she should
be telling me what to do.

11:22.065 --> 11:23.764
Marlo, you're glowing.

11:23.766 --> 11:27.068
God, really? 'Cause I feel
like an abandoned trash barge.

11:27.070 --> 11:28.369
Huh?

11:28.371 --> 11:31.472
Oh. In the '80s,
there was this giant boat

11:31.474 --> 11:33.941
filled with garbage
that just...

11:33.943 --> 11:36.376
drifted up and down
the East Coast... for weeks.

11:36.378 --> 11:38.712
They couldn't figure out
where to dump it,

11:38.714 --> 11:41.381
so eventually, they just
docked the boat in Brooklyn,

11:41.383 --> 11:44.217
burned all that trash.

11:46.421 --> 11:48.989
The ninth month is tough.

11:48.991 --> 11:51.958
- I remember I could barely make it to the gym.
- Yes!

11:51.960 --> 11:54.395
- Let me take this.
- Yes! The Moreaus have arrived.

11:54.397 --> 11:56.396
It's gonna be a great night.

11:56.398 --> 11:58.399
- Drew, how are you, buddy?
- Craig. How's it going?

11:58.401 --> 12:00.067
Great to see you. Marlo.

12:00.069 --> 12:02.870
Yeah, I'm a personal
hug buffer now.

12:02.872 --> 12:05.271
- Well, yeah, just what you've always wanted.
- Yeah.

12:05.273 --> 12:06.807
It's actually kind of true.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.808
When is your due date again?

12:08.810 --> 12:10.477
- Monday.
- Jesus, don't have it here.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.779
She could have it in the ofuro.

12:12.781 --> 12:14.481
We just got
this Japanese soaking tub.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.183
- Craig's boss gave it to us.
- Wow.

12:17.185 --> 12:19.422
My boss once gave me the flu.

12:21.523 --> 12:24.257
So, what are we thinking,
it's a boy or a girl?

12:24.259 --> 12:26.025
- What's happening here?
- You know, I feel

12:26.027 --> 12:28.095
- like it's definitely a boy.
- Marlo didn't want

12:28.097 --> 12:30.430
to find out this time,
but I kind of wish we did.

12:30.432 --> 12:33.100
Mid-40s,
who needs the surprise, right?

12:33.102 --> 12:36.035
Well, you're gonna find out
any day now, so...

12:36.037 --> 12:38.105
exciting.

12:38.107 --> 12:39.776
Yep.

12:45.915 --> 12:48.182
Whoa. Where...
where are the kids sitting?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.516
Oh, they're with Shasta.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.352
They have their own little
kid-friendly spread.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.487
Truffle mac and cheese,
something green.

12:54.489 --> 12:56.390
Yeah, lucky little bastards.

12:56.392 --> 12:58.259
Wow, we can actually have
a conversation.

12:58.261 --> 13:00.260
I know, right?

13:00.262 --> 13:01.831
Oh.

13:02.964 --> 13:05.332
Siri, play hip-hop.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.341
Yeah.

13:14.477 --> 13:17.510
Do you guys have
any chicken nuggets?

13:17.512 --> 13:19.914
He only eats chicken nuggets.

13:19.916 --> 13:22.549
Chicken nuggets are full
of growth hormones.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.485
Do you know
what they do to the chickens

13:24.487 --> 13:25.952
- at factory farms?
- What?

13:25.954 --> 13:27.954
They slice off their beaks
with a hot blade

13:27.956 --> 13:30.824
- so the chickens can't peck each other.
- Mm.

13:30.826 --> 13:33.126
<i>So, Drew, how's work going?</i>

13:33.128 --> 13:35.596
I'm curious about the, um...

13:35.598 --> 13:37.965
Last time we were talking
about, um...

13:37.967 --> 13:39.967
Yeah, nobody...
nobody gets what I do.

13:39.969 --> 13:43.270
I, uh,
I audit organizational paths

13:43.272 --> 13:45.105
and, uh, and systems
for workers

13:45.107 --> 13:47.507
in a proto-corporate structure.

13:47.509 --> 13:49.242
- Mm.
- Oh, yeah. 'Course.

13:49.244 --> 13:50.910
That's fun.

13:50.912 --> 13:53.213
Um, it's...
I hit a snag lately,

13:53.215 --> 13:55.515
so it's kind of, uh,
compelling right now, but...

13:55.517 --> 13:58.986
You're swamped,
on a big project.

13:58.988 --> 14:02.021
Well, that and... three.

14:06.161 --> 14:09.129
You know, the, uh,
that thing in your stomach.

14:09.131 --> 14:11.564
Oh.

14:11.566 --> 14:14.168
- Yeah, three kids.
- Mm.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.602
- Crazy.
- Yep.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.072
You're gonna love it.
We love having three.

14:18.074 --> 14:20.274
And the third kid
is always the easiest. Right?

14:20.276 --> 14:21.574
- Oh, yeah.
- Fred is so chill.

14:21.576 --> 14:23.544
You can ignore him. It's fine.

14:23.546 --> 14:25.612
Chill would be nice.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.414
Yeah, you guys really have
your hands full with Jonah.

14:28.416 --> 14:31.117
Um, not in a bad way.

14:31.119 --> 14:33.386
I mean, he's such a great kid.

14:33.388 --> 14:34.654
He's quirky.

14:34.656 --> 14:37.024
His school wants us
to get him an aide,

14:37.026 --> 14:39.159
'cause I guess
the teachers can't handle him.

14:39.161 --> 14:40.895
Oh, that's awesome.

14:40.897 --> 14:46.165
Um, that they're, you know,
recognizing his needs.

14:46.167 --> 14:48.034
- Yeah, no, they're...
- Yeah.

14:48.036 --> 14:50.006
they're all over it.

14:51.574 --> 14:53.240
Marlo, remind me after dinner

14:53.242 --> 14:55.312
I want to show you
something cool.

14:56.378 --> 14:58.511
I've already seen the G-Wagon.

14:58.513 --> 15:00.280
It's not the G-Wagon.

15:00.282 --> 15:02.051
It's very cool.
You're gonna like it.

15:22.972 --> 15:25.041
Do you like it?

15:26.575 --> 15:28.641
When do the birds
start singing?

15:28.643 --> 15:30.311
Okay, you know,
it was inspired by one

15:30.313 --> 15:33.414
- of the most beautiful places I've ever been.
- Epcot?

15:33.416 --> 15:35.281
Tahiti.

15:36.985 --> 15:40.386
Sit down, asshole.
I'll make you a drink.

15:40.388 --> 15:42.389
So, um, I want to talk to you.

15:42.391 --> 15:45.959
I have an idea for a special
baby gift this time around.

15:45.961 --> 15:48.194
- Ooh, is it money?
- No.

15:48.196 --> 15:50.463
I don't mind money.

15:50.465 --> 15:52.533
I'm not above that.
You know that, right?

15:52.535 --> 15:56.106
Yeah. Do you know
what a night nanny is?

15:57.605 --> 16:00.307
- Oh.
- Okay, you know what, everybody does it.

16:00.309 --> 16:02.076
At least everyone
we know does it.

16:02.078 --> 16:04.510
It's just like a regular nanny,
except they come at night.

16:04.512 --> 16:07.047
You know, they stay over
for a few weeks, or a month,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.015
and they take care
of the baby at night,

16:09.017 --> 16:11.617
so Mom and Dad can get
some sleep. It's no big deal.

16:11.619 --> 16:13.522
What? Does she breastfeed?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.723
No, she doesn't breastfeed
your ba...

16:16.725 --> 16:19.092
This is not feudal China.

16:19.094 --> 16:20.561
No. She wakes you up,

16:20.563 --> 16:23.263
so you... can, you know,

16:23.265 --> 16:24.664
do the...

16:24.666 --> 16:26.332
- Don't do that.
- breastfeeding,

16:26.334 --> 16:27.668
and then you pass off the baby,

16:27.670 --> 16:29.470
and go to sleep
when you're done.

16:29.472 --> 16:31.605
Everybody wins.

16:31.607 --> 16:33.439
I don't want a stranger
in my house

16:33.441 --> 16:35.308
bonding with my newborn
every night.

16:35.310 --> 16:36.643
That's like a Lifetime movie,

16:36.645 --> 16:38.478
where the nanny tries
to kill the family

16:38.480 --> 16:40.514
and the mom survives
and she has to walk

16:40.516 --> 16:42.249
- with a cane at the end.
- Right.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.117
Well, we had a night nanny.

16:44.119 --> 16:45.552
I don't remember that.

16:45.554 --> 16:48.188
The reason you
don't remember it is because...

16:48.190 --> 16:49.622
she only came at night.

16:49.624 --> 16:51.558
They're like ninjas...
they sneak in and out.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.159
You barely even know
they're there.

16:53.161 --> 16:55.197
Elyse said she was great.

16:57.532 --> 16:59.098
Craig, please tell me

16:59.100 --> 17:01.704
you didn't hire me
one of those people.

17:03.706 --> 17:06.040
Oh, my God, you did.

17:06.041 --> 17:08.307
Okay, Marlo...

17:08.309 --> 17:11.111
you have a lot going on.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.579
I know this kid
wasn't... planned.

17:13.582 --> 17:16.115
And yes, yes,
it's the greatest thing

17:16.117 --> 17:18.384
that's ever happened... he's
a miracle straight from Heaven,

17:18.386 --> 17:19.453
blah, blah, blah, blah.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.653
But...

17:20.655 --> 17:23.625
I don't want
what happened last time.

17:24.559 --> 17:26.126
Don't do that.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.061
- Hey. I love you.
- No, seriously,

17:28.064 --> 17:29.729
- you're being an asshole. Stop.
- Drew needs to focus

17:29.731 --> 17:32.765
on his protostructures,
and you need to be happy...

17:32.767 --> 17:35.436
especially for Jonah.

17:35.438 --> 17:38.405
I-I see the way
you're looking at me.

17:38.407 --> 17:40.306
I know you think
this is just some...

17:40.308 --> 17:42.609
bougie thing that
only rich assholes do.

17:42.611 --> 17:44.277
And maybe it is, okay? Maybe.

17:44.279 --> 17:46.647
But don't forget,
I wasn't always a rich asshole.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.483
I grew up in that same
shitty house as you did,

17:49.485 --> 17:51.251
- same shitty parents,
- Oh, my...

17:51.253 --> 17:53.352
same shit-brown Buick,

17:53.354 --> 17:55.155
and I'm telling you, Marlo...

17:55.157 --> 17:56.290
Yes.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.623
...get over yourself.

17:57.625 --> 17:58.758
Call her.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.629
She comes highly recommended.

18:04.333 --> 18:08.235
You can't just outsource
your entire life.

18:08.237 --> 18:10.470
Sounds pretty ideal to me.

18:10.472 --> 18:13.640
You don't have to wake up
five times a night or whatever.

18:13.642 --> 18:15.742
You don't even wake up anyway.

18:15.744 --> 18:18.081
Well, I don't have boobs.

18:19.148 --> 18:20.246
Not yet.

18:20.248 --> 18:22.381
It's not like
I could do anything.

18:22.383 --> 18:24.118
It's fine.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.384
It is.

18:25.386 --> 18:27.420
You have a big year.

18:29.325 --> 18:32.226
You know, I've got
a couple of trips coming up.

18:32.228 --> 18:34.631
You-you think
you're gonna be okay?

18:38.400 --> 18:40.534
- Honey?
- Hmm? What?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.369
Where'd you go?

18:42.371 --> 18:44.674
Did you say something?

19:37.258 --> 19:40.729
Hi, uh, we're here
to have this baby.

19:49.904 --> 19:51.938
You're gonna feel
a little bit of freezing, okay?

19:51.940 --> 19:53.707
This will be a little pinch.

19:53.709 --> 19:55.809
Three, two, one, pinch.

19:55.811 --> 19:58.211
It's going to go nice
and numb in a sec.

19:58.213 --> 19:58.844
Good work.

19:58.846 --> 20:00.479
Oh, you're great.

20:00.481 --> 20:02.561
...the collection that we're
going to see here today.

20:02.949 --> 20:04.751
Well, tonight's theme
is Mermaid Cove,

20:04.753 --> 20:08.354
so we're celebrating
the beauty of mermaids

20:08.356 --> 20:09.488
with all of our models.

20:09.490 --> 20:11.326
We have some really long...

20:18.566 --> 20:20.734
Breathe it out. Breathe it out.

20:20.736 --> 20:23.469
- Breathe it out.
- And go, go, go, go, go, go.

20:24.573 --> 20:25.706
There you go.

20:25.708 --> 20:26.708
It's a girl. It's a girl.

20:27.942 --> 20:30.444
It's a girl.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.879
Oh, you've got a girl.

20:32.881 --> 20:34.880
You okay?

20:42.958 --> 20:45.659
Hi, sweetheart.
Oh.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.026
Hi.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.794
Okay.

20:48.796 --> 20:50.296
Oh, she's so sweet.

20:50.298 --> 20:50.930
Yeah.

20:50.932 --> 20:53.499
Marlo, she's your mini.

20:53.501 --> 20:56.335
Look at those lips.

20:56.337 --> 20:57.803
I wish we could stay.

20:57.805 --> 21:00.674
We have to go
to Emmy's school talent show.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.743
Oh, what's her talent?

21:02.745 --> 21:05.344
Pilates.

21:05.346 --> 21:07.781
Do you mind putting her back
in the bassinet for me?

21:07.783 --> 21:09.886
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

21:12.054 --> 21:15.322
All right, you,
take it easy, okay?

21:15.324 --> 21:18.391
Tell Dad congrats
when he wakes up.

21:18.393 --> 21:19.495
Yep.

21:20.562 --> 21:22.795
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:38.413 --> 21:39.979
<i>So, did you end up talking</i>

21:39.981 --> 21:41.480
<i>to her about the night nanny?</i>

21:41.482 --> 21:43.883
I did. She said
she could never let a stranger

21:43.885 --> 21:45.384
take care of her baby.

21:45.386 --> 21:48.621
What? So she's judging
our choices now.

21:48.623 --> 21:49.956
I just want my sister back.

21:49.958 --> 21:52.059
I feel like,
these last few years,

21:52.061 --> 21:54.361
somebody snuffed a match.

21:54.363 --> 21:55.661
Well, maybe
you should call Drew

21:55.663 --> 21:58.564
and see if he can convince her.

21:58.566 --> 22:00.700
Drew hates me.

22:00.702 --> 22:03.402
Mm-hmm.

22:11.013 --> 22:12.879
Hey, did you hear it?

22:12.881 --> 22:14.348
That's not enough.

22:14.350 --> 22:15.881
I peed.

22:15.883 --> 22:17.583
Come on,
why is it so important?

22:17.585 --> 22:18.851
If you don't pee soon,

22:18.853 --> 22:19.986
we'll have to put
the catheter back in.

22:19.988 --> 22:21.021
I peed.
Why don't you believe me?

22:21.023 --> 22:22.889
It's in there, in the bowl.

22:22.891 --> 22:24.358
Do a test or something.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.092
You have to show me
that you can do a pee.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.128
How much fucking pee
do you need?!

22:28.130 --> 22:30.697
Do you want me to spray it
all over the bathroom?

22:30.699 --> 22:32.765
Do you want
a fucking golden shower?

22:32.767 --> 22:35.468
You need to rest, Mommy.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.942
I have to fucking pee.

24:25.146 --> 24:27.147
Aren't you
the most precious little...?

24:40.562 --> 24:42.661
Where are my legs?
What's going on?

24:42.663 --> 24:44.163
This is crazy, we're...

24:44.165 --> 24:45.265
Mermaids!

24:55.510 --> 24:56.642
No, no, no!

25:13.629 --> 25:15.661
Okay, let go, I'm late.

25:15.663 --> 25:17.132
Jonah, I'm late.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.799
Hey.

25:19.801 --> 25:21.534
- Hi.
- Thanks, Dallas.

25:21.536 --> 25:23.236
Oh, so we have
a little visitor today, huh?

25:23.238 --> 25:25.005
Yeah, she's sleeping.

25:25.007 --> 25:26.238
Okay.

25:28.009 --> 25:30.176
So, we're coming up on the end
of the kindergarten year,

25:30.178 --> 25:32.678
and I just wanted to talk
to you about Mr. Jonah.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.814
Look, we're, um, getting
the aide, the one aide.

25:35.816 --> 25:38.217
Just got to figure out
how we're gonna pay for it.

25:38.219 --> 25:40.152
Well, when you guys applied,

25:40.154 --> 25:42.555
we did express some concern
about whether

25:42.557 --> 25:44.990
or not Saint Vitus was
the right fit for Jonah,

25:44.992 --> 25:47.826
but we love your family and we
have such a great relationship

25:47.828 --> 25:49.563
- with your brother and his wife.
- I understand.

25:49.565 --> 25:51.230
- What?
- I get it, Laurie,

25:51.232 --> 25:53.099
I'm only here
because of my brother.

25:53.101 --> 25:55.134
No, that's not true, actually.

25:55.136 --> 25:57.970
They're big donors,
they called in a favor.

25:57.972 --> 26:00.976
Yeah, okay.

26:02.710 --> 26:06.248
We think Jonah might be better
served at a different school.

26:07.181 --> 26:09.181
You're expelling him?

26:09.183 --> 26:12.351
No, Marlo,
expulsion is a punishment.

26:12.353 --> 26:15.088
We like to think of this
as a dismissal.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.090
There are places

26:17.092 --> 26:19.793
that are better suited
to kids like Jonah.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.262
What does that mean,
"kids like Jonah"?

26:22.264 --> 26:24.264
Well, he's quirky

26:24.266 --> 26:25.799
- and he needs...
- Oh, my God,

26:25.801 --> 26:27.333
what is this "quirky" thing

26:27.335 --> 26:28.901
everybody keeps saying?
It's so stupid.

26:28.903 --> 26:30.102
What does it even mean?

26:30.104 --> 26:32.772
Do I have a kid
or a fucking ukulele?

26:32.774 --> 26:34.006
Just say what you mean.

26:34.008 --> 26:36.008
You think Jonah is retarded.

26:36.010 --> 26:37.009
- No.
- Yes, and he's ruining it

26:37.011 --> 26:39.245
for everybody in
his class who's reading, like,

26:39.247 --> 26:42.381
"The Iliad"
or whatever the fuck they read!

26:42.383 --> 26:45.619
I'm sorry
about my retarded son, Laurie.

26:45.621 --> 26:49.956
Oh, I'm sorry, quirky, 'cause
he's a fucking pocket watch.

26:49.958 --> 26:52.292
- Fuck this!
- No, no, no.

26:52.294 --> 26:54.026
- Jonah is bright, he's great.
- Oh, my God.

26:54.028 --> 26:55.894
- It's just not the right fit, Marlo.
- Just say what you mean.

26:55.896 --> 26:57.296
- You hate my kid!
- What?!

26:57.298 --> 26:59.131
- You hate us!
- We don't hate you.

26:59.133 --> 27:00.367
- We don't hate your kid.
- Oh, my God.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.302
It's just not the right fit.

27:02.304 --> 27:03.303
Dallas, would you please
walk her out?

27:03.305 --> 27:04.903
Don't fucking touch me, Dallas.

27:04.905 --> 27:06.739
- I wasn't.
- Look, I... no, you need to calm down.

27:06.741 --> 27:07.974
I'm not letting you leave
like this.

27:07.976 --> 27:08.975
I leave like this every day.

27:08.977 --> 27:11.143
Every day.

27:11.145 --> 27:12.746
You just don't see it.
This is the real me

27:12.748 --> 27:14.413
when I'm not licking
your asshole.

27:14.415 --> 27:16.149
Surprise!

27:16.151 --> 27:18.787
Oh!

27:20.788 --> 27:22.724
She's fine.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.174
Fuck!

27:58.093 --> 27:59.958
Just take it.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.094
Please, please, just take it.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.157
Hey, guys.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.158
Hi, Daddy!

29:05.160 --> 29:06.860
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:06.862 --> 29:08.026
Ooh.

29:08.028 --> 29:09.963
Oh, give me a smile.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.264
You got a smile for Daddy?

29:11.266 --> 29:14.767
Yeah, that's Daddy's smile.

29:16.304 --> 29:19.037
Hey, frozen pizza, awesome.

29:19.039 --> 29:20.172
Um...

29:21.809 --> 29:24.212
I thought we weren't doing
screen time.

29:25.814 --> 29:29.752
I mean, uh, it's fine by me,
it's-it's your rule.

29:30.951 --> 29:33.453
Listen, I decided to call
that night nanny.

29:33.455 --> 29:35.188
You did?

29:35.190 --> 29:37.189
- Oh.
- Yeah, why?

29:37.191 --> 29:38.490
Uh, no, I mean, uh, it's...

29:38.492 --> 29:40.293
You know,
Craig's paying for it.

29:40.295 --> 29:43.228
He's probably going
to lord that over us.

29:43.230 --> 29:44.229
No, you're right,
I'll just cancel it.

29:44.231 --> 29:45.832
You do your thing.

29:45.834 --> 29:48.066
I'll just be down here
and make another pot of coffee,

29:48.068 --> 29:49.201
- never sleep at all.
- No.

29:49.203 --> 29:51.303
I-I-I didn't mean that,
I just...

29:51.305 --> 29:53.105
Are you okay?

29:53.107 --> 29:54.841
Hey, guys, is Mommy okay?

29:54.843 --> 29:56.042
I don't know.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.111
She's coming at 10:30.

30:00.282 --> 30:02.815
Jonah.

30:09.157 --> 30:11.861
Mom, what's wrong
with your body?

30:38.018 --> 30:39.185
So, is that what you're into?

30:39.187 --> 30:40.890
You're into a little, uh...

30:44.491 --> 30:46.492
You're into a little, uh...

30:49.096 --> 30:50.362
I love spanking women

30:50.364 --> 30:54.167
during the act of,
you know, making love.

30:54.169 --> 30:57.536
I guess a little spanking isn't
making love? I don't know.

30:58.940 --> 30:59.975
You've got a great ass.

31:19.427 --> 31:22.565
Oh, God.

31:26.601 --> 31:28.571
Hello.

31:29.904 --> 31:31.507
I'm Tully.

31:33.374 --> 31:35.374
You must be Marlo.

31:35.376 --> 31:36.376
Yes.

31:36.378 --> 31:37.377
May I come in?

31:37.379 --> 31:39.579
Yeah.

31:39.581 --> 31:41.517
Oh.

31:42.417 --> 31:45.454
Who's this?

31:46.388 --> 31:47.453
Oh, you mean the baby?

31:47.455 --> 31:48.557
Yeah, what's her name?

31:50.325 --> 31:53.495
Her name is Mia.

31:54.595 --> 31:56.528
Mia.

31:56.530 --> 31:59.198
Yeah, it was my Mom's name.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.600
I was always gonna use it,

32:00.602 --> 32:03.335
but then it became,
like, really popular and...

32:03.337 --> 32:04.469
There's two Mias
in my son's class.

32:04.471 --> 32:05.705
Who cares?

32:05.707 --> 32:07.473
What?

32:07.475 --> 32:08.573
Who cares if it's popular?

32:08.575 --> 32:11.079
It's a beautiful name.

32:22.222 --> 32:23.555
I'm sorry, how old are you?

32:23.557 --> 32:26.492
I didn't... I don't mean...
I just didn't expect...

32:28.129 --> 32:30.496
No, I, I get it a lot.

32:30.498 --> 32:33.035
Um, I'm older than I look.

32:36.537 --> 32:40.206
Oh, I don't... um...

32:40.208 --> 32:42.411
What?

32:43.311 --> 32:44.977
How does this normally work?

32:45.814 --> 32:47.580
Well, how would
you like it to work?

32:47.582 --> 32:50.082
Uh, I don't know.

32:50.084 --> 32:52.651
Okay.

32:52.653 --> 32:54.555
I'm here to take care of you.

32:56.490 --> 32:58.524
I thought you were taking care
of the baby.

32:58.526 --> 33:00.493
Yeah, but you pretty much
are the baby.

33:00.495 --> 33:02.594
I mean, even though this one's

33:02.596 --> 33:05.264
been earth-side
for three weeks,

33:05.266 --> 33:07.265
her DNA is still inside of you.

33:07.267 --> 33:09.002
Right, yeah.

33:09.004 --> 33:10.535
No, actually her cells
will hang around

33:10.537 --> 33:12.537
in your bloodstream for years,

33:12.539 --> 33:16.542
and though Mia here will be
her own person someday,

33:16.544 --> 33:19.277
right now she's still very much
an extension of you.

33:19.279 --> 33:23.149
She knows your smell,
your voice, your heartbeat.

33:23.151 --> 33:25.150
And you know her
better than anyone.

33:25.152 --> 33:27.422
I mean, you built her
from the toes up.

33:33.495 --> 33:36.031
And so to bed.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.432
What?

33:40.434 --> 33:42.034
Samuel Pepys.

33:42.036 --> 33:45.207
He had a diary
during the English Restoration.

33:47.441 --> 33:49.441
Right, Samuel Pepys.

33:49.443 --> 33:51.044
Yeah.

33:51.046 --> 33:52.711
I'll settle in
down here with Mia.

33:52.713 --> 33:55.448
You go upstairs
and get some rest.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.783
Should I show you
how to do the...?

33:56.785 --> 33:59.118
No, we got a place to sleep,
we got diapers.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.821
We're good.

34:01.823 --> 34:02.655
Right?

34:02.657 --> 34:04.256
Yes.

34:07.194 --> 34:09.362
Okay.

34:09.364 --> 34:11.596
I'll come wake you up
when she's ready to nurse.

34:11.598 --> 34:13.799
Oh, okay.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.603
Night.

34:16.538 --> 34:18.639
What the...?

34:45.366 --> 34:46.498
Hey.

34:46.500 --> 34:49.502
The night nanny's downstairs.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.337
Oh, what's she like?

34:52.339 --> 34:53.505
Weird.

34:53.507 --> 34:56.109
What?

34:56.110 --> 34:58.080
Weird.

34:59.247 --> 35:01.817
Are we just gonna leave
her down there with Mia?

35:04.118 --> 35:06.252
Yeah, I guess.

35:06.254 --> 35:08.223
Okay.

35:21.402 --> 35:24.073
Jonah, stop.

35:32.513 --> 35:35.147
Jonah! Stop it!

35:37.285 --> 35:38.518
Jonah, stop!

35:40.288 --> 35:41.853
Oh, my God.

35:41.855 --> 35:43.723
Mommy.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.391
- Tully.
- What?

35:45.393 --> 35:46.525
Hi. Shh.

35:46.527 --> 35:47.826
- Yeah, easy, easy.
- Hi.

35:47.828 --> 35:49.328
She's ready for you.

35:49.330 --> 35:53.165
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Good?

35:57.906 --> 35:59.172
May I?

35:59.174 --> 36:01.507
Okay.

36:02.609 --> 36:04.312
- Good?
- Yeah.

36:58.399 --> 37:01.400
Why is the house so clean?

37:13.448 --> 37:14.446
<i>So, wait,</i>

37:14.448 --> 37:16.248
<i>she was in our bedroom
last night?</i>

37:16.250 --> 37:17.650
Yeah.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.984
She brought Mia over to nurse

37:18.986 --> 37:21.487
and then she just sat
in the shadows

37:21.489 --> 37:22.754
waiting for me to finish.

37:22.756 --> 37:24.390
Hmm, creepy.

37:24.392 --> 37:25.591
How did I not wake up?

37:25.593 --> 37:26.826
God, I can't imagine.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.294
And then she went downstairs

37:28.296 --> 37:30.495
and chiseled eight years
of filth off the floors.

37:30.497 --> 37:31.663
I know.

37:31.665 --> 37:34.533
- Maybe she's nocturnal.
- Huh.

37:34.535 --> 37:35.667
Yeah, like Sarah's hamster.

37:35.669 --> 37:36.768
You remember that thing?

37:36.770 --> 37:37.937
God.

37:37.939 --> 37:39.605
The wheel all night long.

37:39.607 --> 37:41.707
- She ate her own young.
- Hey.

37:41.709 --> 37:43.341
Mom, I need water.

37:43.343 --> 37:46.279
- The game hasn't started yet.
- So? I'm thirsty.

37:46.281 --> 37:50.016
Anyway, it was like
she took over.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.817
She just, she knew exactly
what to do.

37:52.819 --> 37:54.953
So, like me in bed.

37:54.955 --> 37:56.821
No, she makes eye contact.

37:58.926 --> 38:01.493
So, how do you feel?

38:01.495 --> 38:02.962
Honestly?

38:02.964 --> 38:05.698
I can't remember the last time
I slept like that.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.933
I mean...

38:07.935 --> 38:10.335
it's like I can
see color again.

38:10.337 --> 38:12.306
Can we keep her?

38:15.643 --> 38:18.377
She's not a dog.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.712
...is trying to figure out

38:19.714 --> 38:20.846
what my clients really need.

38:20.848 --> 38:22.013
One thing about Billie is this.

38:22.015 --> 38:23.915
She just wants
what we all want

38:23.917 --> 38:26.287
which is companionship
and love.

38:28.756 --> 38:30.656
And I think she's into
a man's man.

38:30.658 --> 38:31.924
She likes a guy

38:31.926 --> 38:34.462
that's not afraid
to get dirty.

38:36.698 --> 38:38.563
- Hi.
- Hey.

38:38.565 --> 38:40.031
Good evening.

38:40.033 --> 38:41.933
Thank you for cleaning
the house the other day.

38:41.935 --> 38:43.335
You really...

38:43.337 --> 38:44.636
you really didn't
have to do that.

38:44.638 --> 38:46.071
No, I enjoyed it.

38:46.073 --> 38:48.708
I'm like Saudi Arabia...
I have an energy surplus.

38:48.710 --> 38:51.280
Oh, all right.

38:53.614 --> 38:55.013
- What's this?
- Oh, God.

38:55.015 --> 38:56.515
I'm sorry. That, um...

38:56.517 --> 38:58.717
No, what is it?

38:58.719 --> 39:01.587
It's, um...

39:01.589 --> 39:05.757
it's a reality TV show
called <i>Gigolos.</i>

39:05.759 --> 39:08.426
What's it about?

39:08.428 --> 39:10.795
Gigolos.

39:10.797 --> 39:13.531
Who's he?

39:13.533 --> 39:14.632
That's Brace.

39:14.634 --> 39:16.935
He's the oldest of the gigolos.

39:16.937 --> 39:19.739
And women pay
to sleep with him?

39:19.741 --> 39:21.373
Well, no. He aged out,

39:21.375 --> 39:24.377
so they gave him a position
in upper management and...

39:24.379 --> 39:25.777
Oh.

39:25.779 --> 39:27.779
You know what, I am going to

39:27.781 --> 39:28.815
turn this off.

39:28.817 --> 39:30.850
No, no, no, don't, please.
You're enjoying it.

39:30.852 --> 39:33.451
Oh, no, I was just,
it was on TV.

39:33.453 --> 39:34.520
Marlo...

39:34.522 --> 39:36.788
you can't be
self-conscious of me.

39:36.790 --> 39:39.093
This won't work if you are.

39:40.627 --> 39:42.962
I'm just not used to people
doing things for me.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.062
That's all.

39:44.064 --> 39:48.833
Okay.
Just pretend I'm Brace.

39:48.835 --> 39:52.538
Uh, well,
you're more of an Ash.

39:52.540 --> 39:56.542
He's this Tantric
Indian gigolo.

39:56.544 --> 40:00.879
Practices, uh, meditation
and speaks Japanese.

40:00.881 --> 40:02.116
<i>Kon'nichiwa.</i>

40:06.421 --> 40:07.752
Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs.

40:07.754 --> 40:08.920
Okay.

40:08.922 --> 40:10.556
- Watch a movie with Drew.
- Okay.

40:10.558 --> 40:12.824
- Okay.
- Have fun.

40:12.826 --> 40:13.893
Yeah.

40:13.895 --> 40:15.560
Oh, I can put on headphones

40:15.562 --> 40:17.696
if you guys want
to make some noise.

40:17.698 --> 40:20.833
Oh, no, we don't...

40:20.835 --> 40:23.201
I'm...

40:23.203 --> 40:24.837
- We're good.
- Okay.

40:24.839 --> 40:28.107
Hey, kiss good night.

40:28.109 --> 40:30.676
She'll be different
in the morning.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.545
That's sweet.

40:32.547 --> 40:35.614
No. She will.
She'll grow a little overnight.

40:35.616 --> 40:38.453
So will we.

40:41.122 --> 40:45.093
Hey, baby,
say good night to Mommy?

40:51.966 --> 40:54.132
- Good night.
- Good night.

40:54.134 --> 40:56.138
Hi.

41:32.973 --> 41:35.676
Oh... oh, God.

41:50.857 --> 41:53.692
She's got a strong latch.

41:53.694 --> 41:56.060
Yeah, she's a barnacle.

41:56.062 --> 41:58.663
Okay, so if she's a barnacle,

41:58.665 --> 42:01.000
are you a boat
or are you a whale?

42:01.002 --> 42:03.569
I don't know.

42:03.571 --> 42:06.304
Well, barnacles hurt boats,
but they don't hurt whales.

42:06.306 --> 42:09.208
- Oh.
- If a barnacle latches onto a whale, it's harmless.

42:09.210 --> 42:11.643
It's just this little
obligate parasite

42:11.645 --> 42:13.214
doing its thing.

42:17.218 --> 42:18.951
Does she look like
your other kids?

42:18.953 --> 42:21.020
Yeah.

42:21.022 --> 42:22.721
She looks a lot like
my daughter, Sarah.

42:22.723 --> 42:24.723
What's Sarah like?

42:24.725 --> 42:25.824
She's eight.

42:25.826 --> 42:28.226
She's getting at this age

42:28.228 --> 42:30.728
where she's starting to be
really hard on herself.

42:30.730 --> 42:32.964
It makes me nervous 'cause
it doesn't get any easier

42:32.966 --> 42:35.768
for girls, you know?

42:35.770 --> 42:38.139
No, it doesn't.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.708
What about Jonah?

42:42.710 --> 42:44.743
Jonah's great.

42:44.745 --> 42:47.214
I mean, he's exhausting.

42:49.116 --> 42:51.317
We don't really know
what his deal is.

42:51.319 --> 42:53.152
We've seen three
different doctors

42:53.154 --> 42:55.920
and all they can really tell us
is that he's atypical.

42:55.922 --> 42:59.294
He's got all these strange
behaviors and anxieties.

43:01.361 --> 43:03.728
We...

43:03.730 --> 43:08.600
we brush him like...

43:08.602 --> 43:12.740
I brush his body at night,
like a horse.

43:14.007 --> 43:15.708
Why?

43:15.710 --> 43:17.275
I don't know,
his therapist told us

43:17.277 --> 43:19.210
it's supposed to reduce
his sensitivities

43:19.212 --> 43:20.812
to everyday things.

43:20.814 --> 43:22.281
Oh.

43:22.283 --> 43:24.315
We can't afford
the therapist anymore,

43:24.317 --> 43:26.618
so I just watched
these YouTube videos

43:26.620 --> 43:28.286
and figured out how to do it.

43:28.288 --> 43:33.993
It's called Wilbarger's Brush Protocol.

43:33.995 --> 43:36.661
Protocol.

43:36.663 --> 43:38.029
Sounds official.

43:38.031 --> 43:40.632
Officially shitty.

43:43.169 --> 43:47.406
Well, you seem
like a great mom.

43:48.542 --> 43:52.745
Great moms organize class
parties and casino night.

43:52.747 --> 43:56.181
They bake cupcakes
that look like Minions.

43:56.183 --> 43:59.317
All the things
I'm just too tired to do.

43:59.319 --> 44:03.022
Honestly, even getting dressed
just feels exhausting.

44:03.024 --> 44:04.656
I open my closet

44:04.658 --> 44:06.725
and I just think,
didn't I just do this?

44:06.727 --> 44:08.926
Yeah, but that's the downside
of living on a planet

44:08.928 --> 44:10.228
with a short solar day.

44:10.230 --> 44:13.098
Although Jupiter
is even shorter.

44:14.368 --> 44:17.268
You're like a book of fun facts
for unpopular fourth graders.

44:19.073 --> 44:22.808
What do you do?

44:22.810 --> 44:27.779
- Human resources with a company that makes protein bars.
- Oh.

44:27.781 --> 44:31.884
My English lit degree
really paid off.

44:31.886 --> 44:33.384
Okay.

44:33.386 --> 44:36.624
Uh, so, what did you
want to do?

44:40.027 --> 44:42.995
I don't... I mean, if I had
a dream that didn't come true,

44:42.997 --> 44:46.768
I could at least be pissed off
at the world.

44:49.169 --> 44:51.839
Instead I'm just pissed off
at myself.

44:53.107 --> 44:55.774
You're empty.

44:55.776 --> 44:58.310
Yeah.

44:58.312 --> 45:00.913
No, you're empty on this side.

45:00.915 --> 45:01.781
She's done.

45:01.783 --> 45:03.882
- Oh.
- Here, I'll take her.

45:03.884 --> 45:05.320
Okay.

45:07.888 --> 45:10.723
Hi, little bear.

45:10.725 --> 45:13.694
Hi, little doll.

45:15.930 --> 45:17.029
Marlo?

45:17.031 --> 45:18.730
Hmm?

45:18.732 --> 45:20.899
I'm here to help you
with everything,

45:20.901 --> 45:22.270
not just Mia.

45:24.437 --> 45:27.441
You can't fix the parts
without treating the whole.

45:29.375 --> 45:31.210
Yeah, no one's treated
my whole

45:31.212 --> 45:32.881
in a really long time.

45:35.149 --> 45:38.750
Oh.

45:38.752 --> 45:39.921
My baby.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.022
Are we going to have
a good day today?

45:44.024 --> 45:45.156
Meow.

45:45.158 --> 45:46.891
Ooh, are you a little kitten?

45:46.893 --> 45:47.895
Meow.

45:51.931 --> 45:54.368
What the...?

46:01.841 --> 46:02.943
Hi.

46:04.210 --> 46:06.178
Is it okay
if we bring in treats?

46:06.180 --> 46:07.846
They're nut-free.

46:07.848 --> 46:08.714
My mommy made them.

46:08.716 --> 46:11.150
I want cupcakes.

46:11.152 --> 46:12.150
I am gonna steal this one.

46:12.152 --> 46:13.417
- No!
- Yes.

46:13.419 --> 46:16.989
- Hey, Mia. Mia.
- I want one.

46:16.991 --> 46:19.290
- Okay.
- I want one.

46:19.292 --> 46:20.792
<i>Hi.</i>

46:20.794 --> 46:24.429
- Oh.
- I'm here to apologize for the other day.

46:24.431 --> 46:26.165
I brought an olive branch
of sorts.

46:26.167 --> 46:27.431
Actually, it's a cupcake,

46:27.433 --> 46:29.470
but who wants
an olive branch, right?

46:31.772 --> 46:33.538
Sorry, Dallas,
I only brought one.

46:33.540 --> 46:34.973
And, look,

46:34.975 --> 46:37.176
about the Jonah thing,
I-I get it.

46:37.178 --> 46:39.478
You know, sometimes it just
doesn't... it's not a fit.

46:39.480 --> 46:42.114
You know, you'll find
the right place.

46:42.116 --> 46:43.848
Yeah.

46:43.850 --> 46:45.551
We will.

46:45.553 --> 46:47.018
Chapter three
of <i>I Hate Rules!</i>

46:47.020 --> 46:48.252
"Katie Kazoo decides

46:48.254 --> 46:50.054
there should be
no more rules at school."

46:50.056 --> 46:52.290
- So, what are the consequences?
- I don't know.

46:52.292 --> 46:54.326
What about George?
He has ten desserts.

46:54.328 --> 46:56.030
What happens then?

46:57.931 --> 47:00.933
Come on, guys. Dinner.

47:06.406 --> 47:07.906
Oh, my God.

47:07.908 --> 47:10.542
Are you shocked that
I can roast a chicken?

47:10.544 --> 47:13.245
- I am, actually.
- It's so easy.

47:13.247 --> 47:14.513
You just take a bunch of lemon

47:14.515 --> 47:16.147
and you shove it
into the cavity,

47:16.149 --> 47:17.382
a little salt and pepper

47:17.384 --> 47:18.984
- and you're good to go.
- Hmm.

47:18.986 --> 47:20.518
Is the cavity the butt?

47:20.520 --> 47:22.386
Honey, that's gross.
It's not the butt.

47:22.388 --> 47:23.989
What is it?

47:23.991 --> 47:24.890
It's just the gaping hole

47:24.892 --> 47:26.290
where the chicken's organs
used to be.

47:26.292 --> 47:27.525
Hand me the bread.

47:27.527 --> 47:30.328
- That's worse than a butt.
- I know, Sarah.

47:30.330 --> 47:32.533
It's murder.

47:35.002 --> 47:37.402
Ah, there she is.

47:37.404 --> 47:40.105
Hey.

47:40.107 --> 47:42.406
Where's Mia?

47:42.408 --> 47:44.042
How was your day?

47:44.044 --> 47:45.409
Good.

47:45.411 --> 47:48.049
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm starving.

47:54.020 --> 47:56.288
So, what do you do
during the day?

47:56.290 --> 47:58.290
The same thing I do every day,

47:58.292 --> 48:02.928
try to take over the world.

48:02.930 --> 48:06.297
Oh, God.

48:06.299 --> 48:09.467
No, I'm just pretty much
napping mostly.

48:09.469 --> 48:13.170
Wow. God, that's nice.

48:13.172 --> 48:15.910
Hi.

48:17.944 --> 48:19.243
Hi, little bear.

48:19.245 --> 48:21.078
Hey, thanks for those cupcakes.

48:21.080 --> 48:23.315
- No problem.
- Oh...

48:23.317 --> 48:25.083
All right,
I will be in my quarters.

48:25.085 --> 48:27.085
Night-night.

48:27.087 --> 48:29.453
Hi, little bear.

48:29.455 --> 48:32.459
Oh, you're starting
to look like Ma.

48:36.562 --> 48:41.400
And one day he packed his bags
and left.

48:41.402 --> 48:42.600
Yeah.

48:42.602 --> 48:44.101
I have an early flight.

48:44.103 --> 48:45.170
Portland?

48:45.172 --> 48:46.404
Phoenix.

48:46.406 --> 48:48.940
A server farm.

48:48.942 --> 48:50.609
They got me
on a rinky-dink airline

48:50.611 --> 48:51.944
with no seat assignments,

48:51.946 --> 48:53.444
so I just want to
get there early.

48:53.446 --> 48:56.348
Um...

48:56.350 --> 48:58.620
- Are you guys gonna be good?
- Mm-hmm.

49:01.488 --> 49:02.487
Is she okay?

49:02.489 --> 49:04.392
Yeah.

49:06.326 --> 49:10.094
- Um...
- Oh...

49:10.096 --> 49:11.996
So how are you feeling?

49:19.006 --> 49:21.910
I feel fine.

49:23.444 --> 49:25.377
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

49:25.379 --> 49:27.245
Okay, good.

49:27.247 --> 49:28.379
- Okay.
- Good.

49:28.381 --> 49:29.517
All right.

50:03.517 --> 50:05.549
Are you excited about
the new school?

50:05.551 --> 50:07.518
- I'm scared.
- That's okay.

50:07.520 --> 50:12.290
I'm a grown-up, and even I find
new things scary all the time.

50:12.292 --> 50:15.560
- Like your new baby?
- I'm not scared of the baby.

50:15.562 --> 50:17.295
What's going on?

50:17.297 --> 50:18.663
I have to pee.

50:18.665 --> 50:20.031
Oh, God.

50:20.033 --> 50:22.102
Okay, come.
Quick, quick, quick.

50:27.040 --> 50:29.574
Are you sure
nobody's gonna flush?

50:29.576 --> 50:30.808
Nobody's in there.

50:30.810 --> 50:33.310
Nobody's gonna flush,
I promise.

50:33.312 --> 50:34.812
I don't want it to be loud.

50:34.814 --> 50:37.716
Oh, my God.
Jonah, nobody's in there!

50:40.319 --> 50:42.620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was automatic!

50:42.622 --> 50:44.321
Jonah! Jonah!

50:44.323 --> 50:45.457
Jonah, stop!

50:45.459 --> 50:47.058
Jonah. Jonah, stop.

50:47.060 --> 50:49.161
The world is full
of loud toilets.

50:49.163 --> 50:51.263
The world is a loud toilet.
Please, shh.

50:51.265 --> 50:53.065
- Hey.
- Hi.

50:53.067 --> 50:54.498
What's going on, little fella?

50:54.500 --> 50:56.201
Sorry.

50:56.203 --> 50:58.270
He just gets freaked out
by certain noises.

50:58.272 --> 50:59.770
I'm sorry, we're... We'll go.

50:59.772 --> 51:02.009
No, no, you don't have to go.

51:04.511 --> 51:05.579
Hey.

51:08.348 --> 51:11.650
How about you and me hang out
and be trees for a bit?

51:11.652 --> 51:13.417
Is that okay?

51:13.419 --> 51:15.487
Hmm?

51:15.489 --> 51:17.522
Okay.

51:17.524 --> 51:21.228
Can you bring your foot
up like this?

51:27.734 --> 51:30.103
You want to give me
some branches?

51:32.638 --> 51:34.239
That's good stuff.

51:34.241 --> 51:35.873
Big breath in.

51:38.779 --> 51:41.212
Now you blow out
through the leaves.

51:44.618 --> 51:47.121
That's better, right?

51:48.855 --> 51:51.489
You don't have to apologize.

51:51.491 --> 51:53.125
You don't have to leave,

51:53.127 --> 51:55.663
'cause you didn't
do anything wrong.

52:04.337 --> 52:06.670
Oh, come on.

52:06.672 --> 52:08.573
Have fun in class.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.426
- Mom?
- Hmm?

54:09.428 --> 54:12.263
Why do you wear makeup now?

54:12.265 --> 54:14.699
I guess I just want
to look nice sometimes.

54:14.701 --> 54:16.600
Why? You don't like it?

54:16.602 --> 54:18.837
I like it.
You just look different.

54:18.839 --> 54:21.272
Like Draculaura.

54:21.274 --> 54:23.275
Which one is Draculaura again?

54:23.277 --> 54:26.411
She's Dracula's daughter
from Monster High.

54:26.413 --> 54:28.480
Hmm. Monster High.

54:28.482 --> 54:31.283
That's high school
for monsters, right?

54:31.285 --> 54:33.884
Yeah.

54:33.886 --> 54:36.554
What's Draculaura's
story again?

54:36.556 --> 54:38.926
She's 1,600 years old.

54:41.560 --> 54:44.497
Mm. Sounds about right.

55:27.473 --> 55:28.772
Are you okay?

55:28.774 --> 55:31.109
Yeah.

55:31.111 --> 55:33.478
What?

55:33.480 --> 55:35.679
Oh, it's milk.

55:35.681 --> 55:37.752
I make milk.

55:57.738 --> 56:00.138
Is this sangria?

56:00.140 --> 56:01.005
Yeah.

56:01.007 --> 56:03.775
Yeah, it always
reminds me of college.

56:03.777 --> 56:06.911
You see, you are a homemaker.

56:06.913 --> 56:09.147
- Because I made sangria?
- Mm-hmm.

56:09.149 --> 56:11.783
You know they make sangria
in prison toilets, right?

56:11.785 --> 56:14.853
I know. They call it pruno.

56:14.855 --> 56:16.557
Shall we?

56:18.658 --> 56:20.658
Okay.

56:20.660 --> 56:23.560
No shit. I knew a guy
who had one of these once.

56:23.562 --> 56:26.032
- He filled it with water.
- Oh.

56:30.035 --> 56:32.339
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

56:38.712 --> 56:41.078
Does Drew ever ask about me?

56:41.080 --> 56:43.848
Yeah. I mean, he finds
the whole thing a little weird.

56:43.850 --> 56:46.016
Yeah.

56:46.018 --> 56:47.819
Does he like being a dad?

56:47.821 --> 56:49.821
Sure.

56:49.823 --> 56:52.690
The way dads do.

56:52.692 --> 56:56.094
I mean, he works really hard
and then he comes home.

56:56.096 --> 57:00.063
He does the homework,
the reading logs, all that.

57:00.065 --> 57:04.768
We make lunches together,
and then he goes upstairs,

57:04.770 --> 57:08.071
puts on a headset,
kills zombies and passes out.

57:08.073 --> 57:10.074
And you guys don't ever...?

57:10.076 --> 57:11.542
- Have sex?
- Mm-hmm.

57:11.544 --> 57:12.676
Oh, no, not in months.

57:12.678 --> 57:15.679
I mean, it's like
we both want dinner,

57:15.681 --> 57:20.919
we just can't pick a restaurant
or even decide if we're hungry.

57:20.921 --> 57:24.859
Oh. Well, why don't you guys
just talk about it?

57:26.660 --> 57:27.926
Are you in a relationship?

57:27.928 --> 57:30.462
Yeah. I'm in several.

57:33.567 --> 57:35.900
I used to be like that.

57:35.902 --> 57:37.534
Yeah.

57:37.536 --> 57:40.540
I rode every horse on
the carousel until I met Drew.

57:41.475 --> 57:45.045
And... which horse was Drew?

57:47.980 --> 57:50.884
Drew was the bench.

57:52.819 --> 57:54.886
But you love him.

57:54.888 --> 57:58.022
- Yeah.
- Oh.

57:58.024 --> 58:00.058
Definitely.

58:00.060 --> 58:02.826
I know I picked
the right person.

58:02.828 --> 58:05.565
So why don't you guys have sex?

58:07.132 --> 58:09.067
I hold a baby all day,

58:09.069 --> 58:11.569
and it's me and her
and it's primal.

58:11.571 --> 58:14.038
We're like two gorillas
at the zoo.

58:14.040 --> 58:16.674
And then nighttime rolls around
and I'm supposed to just

58:16.676 --> 58:19.676
switch gears like...

58:19.678 --> 58:21.645
hello, all sexy now.

58:21.647 --> 58:24.582
Look at my boobs.
They're all sexual.

58:24.584 --> 58:25.884
It's...

58:25.886 --> 58:27.784
I get that.

58:27.786 --> 58:29.723
Of course you do.

58:31.790 --> 58:32.991
I like Drew.

58:32.993 --> 58:34.958
- No.
- I do.

58:34.960 --> 58:36.261
I mean, what I know about him.

58:36.263 --> 58:39.830
I don't want my kids
to grow up like I did.

58:39.832 --> 58:41.833
I had three stepmothers.

58:41.835 --> 58:43.534
It was...

58:43.536 --> 58:46.069
- It was crazy.
- Okay.

58:46.071 --> 58:48.172
So then we need to fix this.

58:48.174 --> 58:52.877
Because Drew needs
his battery charged.

58:52.879 --> 58:54.812
- His battery?
- His battery.

58:56.181 --> 59:02.120
What kind of...
stuff is he into?

59:02.122 --> 59:04.589
I-I checked
his browser history once,

59:04.591 --> 59:07.324
and it was
pretty basic stuff.

59:07.326 --> 59:09.129
Like?

59:13.799 --> 59:15.799
What?

59:15.801 --> 59:17.100
What? Tell me. I have to know.

59:17.102 --> 59:19.237
What is it?

59:19.239 --> 59:21.806
He'd kill me.

59:21.808 --> 59:22.973
Is it weird?
Is it weird?

59:22.975 --> 59:24.241
No, it's... no.

59:24.243 --> 59:27.178
He just, when he was
in high school,

59:27.180 --> 59:30.214
he worked at this diner,
and he was washing dishes,

59:30.216 --> 59:32.216
and-and all the waitresses
would wear

59:32.218 --> 59:35.252
- those little outfits with the hat and...
- Yeah.

59:35.254 --> 59:39.089
He's just always had a fantasy
about that ever since.

59:39.091 --> 59:41.725
Oh, that's it?

59:41.727 --> 59:43.161
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay, good.

59:43.163 --> 59:44.228
- What?
- I don't know.

59:44.230 --> 59:46.730
I thought it was something
really fucking sinister.

59:46.732 --> 59:49.600
Us? No.

59:49.602 --> 59:52.603
I actually bought
one of the little uniforms

59:52.605 --> 59:54.105
a while back,
thinking, you know,

59:54.107 --> 59:55.707
I'd put it on and surprise him.

59:55.709 --> 59:58.375
- Uh-huh?
- And I just never got around to it.

59:58.377 --> 01:00:00.078
Well, why?

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.145
I just didn't.

01:00:01.147 --> 01:00:02.379
And now my...

01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:05.917
legs have veins, my tits have
veins, my veins have veins.

01:00:05.919 --> 01:00:08.752
I don't know, my body looks
like a relief map

01:00:08.754 --> 01:00:09.920
for a war-torn country.

01:00:09.922 --> 01:00:11.823
Do you still have the uniform?

01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:13.991
Yeah.

01:00:13.993 --> 01:00:17.127
Where is it?

01:00:17.129 --> 01:00:19.196
This is amazing.

01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:21.301
Let me see.

01:00:24.004 --> 01:00:25.902
Patty melt?

01:00:25.904 --> 01:00:27.138
Yeah. No.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.272
You're keeping that.

01:00:29.274 --> 01:00:31.174
- Wow.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:00:31.176 --> 01:00:34.078
You have had zero kids.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.649
Should I leave it on
when we go upstairs?

01:00:37.651 --> 01:00:38.783
Upstairs?

01:00:38.785 --> 01:00:41.219
Uh-huh.

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:43.324
- You're joking.
- Mm-mm.

01:00:47.861 --> 01:00:49.060
Wait.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.663
Come on.

01:00:59.772 --> 01:01:01.938
Oh, wait.
Is this a '50s diner?

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.341
I want to be period accurate.

01:01:03.343 --> 01:01:04.975
No, it's just a regular diner.

01:01:04.977 --> 01:01:06.344
Okay. And am I sassy?

01:01:06.346 --> 01:01:08.679
No, just be like
a friendly waitress

01:01:08.681 --> 01:01:11.114
who's nice
and doesn't talk too much.

01:01:11.116 --> 01:01:13.219
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:29.966
Hi there.

01:01:29.968 --> 01:01:31.435
Hey.

01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:33.071
I don't believe we've met.

01:01:33.073 --> 01:01:34.404
Is it... Marlo...

01:01:34.406 --> 01:01:37.241
If you're not familiar
with our menu,

01:01:37.243 --> 01:01:38.975
I recommend the egg cream.

01:01:38.977 --> 01:01:40.377
What's going on?

01:01:40.379 --> 01:01:41.513
It's okay, Drew.
Just go with it.

01:01:41.515 --> 01:01:43.781
We also have a wonderful
selection of pastries,

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:47.721
and I just put on
a hot pot of coffee.

01:01:51.123 --> 01:01:53.123
Okay.

01:01:54.727 --> 01:01:56.761
I'll tell you what he likes.

01:01:56.763 --> 01:01:58.362
Thank you.

01:01:58.364 --> 01:02:01.235
I'm just a trainee.

01:02:08.174 --> 01:02:10.408
- Hi, Elmo.
- Oh, hi, Zoe.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:12.279
You want to talk to a friend?

01:02:19.018 --> 01:02:20.754
Um...

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:25.159
Are we gonna talk
about last night?

01:02:26.893 --> 01:02:29.025
We don't have to.

01:02:29.027 --> 01:02:31.027
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:33.163
It was pretty great.

01:02:33.165 --> 01:02:34.165
Yeah?

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.067
Yeah. You-you kidding me?

01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:37.902
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Jo-Jo.

01:02:37.904 --> 01:02:39.536
I had a dream about a camel.

01:02:39.538 --> 01:02:42.038
You did?
Were you in the desert?

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.406
No, I was in my house.

01:02:43.408 --> 01:02:45.442
That's silly.
Hey, you want some pancakes?

01:02:45.444 --> 01:02:46.877
- Yes.
- All right.

01:02:46.879 --> 01:02:48.812
Should we try and make
Mickey Mouse?

01:02:48.814 --> 01:02:50.982
The last time we tried,
he only had one ear.

01:02:50.984 --> 01:02:54.384
Today is a two-ear day.

01:02:54.386 --> 01:02:56.020
I can feel it.

01:03:43.435 --> 01:03:45.603
Uh-oh.

01:04:09.995 --> 01:04:11.629
Hey, you guys were right.
We should've listened.

01:04:11.631 --> 01:04:13.964
- About what?
- The night nanny.

01:04:13.966 --> 01:04:15.333
Mm. You called her.

01:04:15.335 --> 01:04:17.000
Dude, it's a game changer.

01:04:17.002 --> 01:04:18.935
I didn't think Marlo
was gonna come around.

01:04:18.937 --> 01:04:20.103
Yeah.

01:04:20.105 --> 01:04:23.174
She seems really... awake.

01:04:25.245 --> 01:04:26.576
Yeah, it's actually
kind of weird.

01:04:26.578 --> 01:04:28.645
Stevie Nicks! Stevie!

01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:52.136
<i>It's too dark.</i>

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:54.170
<i>No, lighter. Lighter, lighter.</i>

01:04:54.172 --> 01:04:56.306
- Lighter, lighter.
- No, it's good enough.

01:04:56.308 --> 01:04:58.275
- Lighter.
- Okay, can you stop?

01:04:58.277 --> 01:04:59.509
Lighter. Lighter.

01:04:59.511 --> 01:05:01.045
Darker, darker.

01:05:01.047 --> 01:05:03.446
- Lighter. Lighter.
- Dark. Dark.

01:05:03.448 --> 01:05:05.549
- Lighter. Lighter.
- Dark.

01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:08.051
Perfect.

01:05:24.603 --> 01:05:27.071
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

01:05:27.073 --> 01:05:28.705
It won't happen again,
I promise.

01:05:28.707 --> 01:05:32.042
It's fine.

01:05:32.044 --> 01:05:33.678
Hey, what's wrong?

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:38.315
Nothing, I'm just in sort of
a fucked-up relationship.

01:05:38.317 --> 01:05:40.116
Which one?

01:05:40.118 --> 01:05:42.085
My roommate.

01:05:42.087 --> 01:05:45.623
Yeah. She's, uh... she's
a troublemaker.

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:49.060
Oh, historically, those have
been my favorite people.

01:05:49.062 --> 01:05:51.462
She just freaks out
every time I bring a guy home.

01:05:51.464 --> 01:05:53.563
Is she religious or something?

01:05:53.565 --> 01:05:56.069
Spends a lot of time
kneeling in front of a toilet.

01:05:58.504 --> 01:06:01.237
Can you get your own place?

01:06:01.239 --> 01:06:04.911
We're kind of... enmeshed.

01:06:09.247 --> 01:06:11.449
Just don't make it personal.

01:06:11.451 --> 01:06:14.518
Why don't you just tell her
you want a change of scenery?

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.254
Why? Why do I
have to lie to her?

01:06:17.256 --> 01:06:18.688
Why can't I just be honest

01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:20.658
and say that we're better off
without each other?

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.125
Because you'll hurt her.

01:06:22.127 --> 01:06:24.562
And if you hurt her,
you'll regret it.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.433
Girls don't heal.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.199
Girls heal.

01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:30.467
No, we don't.

01:06:30.469 --> 01:06:32.136
We might look like
we're all better,

01:06:32.138 --> 01:06:35.142
but if you look close,
we're covered in concealer.

01:06:37.676 --> 01:06:40.678
Fuck.

01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:49.553
Can we go out?

01:06:49.555 --> 01:06:51.554
- Like in the backyard? Yeah.
- No, no, no.

01:06:51.556 --> 01:06:54.324
Like out out, to the city.

01:06:54.326 --> 01:06:56.127
New York?

01:06:56.129 --> 01:06:58.295
Yeah. Let's get a drink.

01:07:00.299 --> 01:07:02.266
Who's gonna look after Mia?

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:05.603
Uh, she still has a father,
doesn't she?

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:08.638
Look, Mia's been
sleeping through the night

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.373
for the past week.

01:07:10.375 --> 01:07:12.542
Drew won't even realize
that we're gone.

01:07:12.544 --> 01:07:14.745
Tully, take the night off.

01:07:14.747 --> 01:07:16.781
Seriously.
I-I am gonna be fine.

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:20.283
Okay, Marlo, you need
to take the night off.

01:07:20.285 --> 01:07:23.487
You can't be a good mother if
you don't practice self-care.

01:07:23.489 --> 01:07:25.221
We deserve this.

01:07:25.223 --> 01:07:27.525
How does getting
shit-wrecked in Manhattan

01:07:27.527 --> 01:07:29.560
qualify as self-care?

01:07:29.562 --> 01:07:32.596
You're right.

01:07:32.598 --> 01:07:34.601
We'll go to Brooklyn.

01:07:40.073 --> 01:07:41.772
I still think
we should have Ubered it.

01:07:41.774 --> 01:07:44.542
I told you,
I'll be the chauffeur.

01:07:44.544 --> 01:07:46.342
So we'll have
a couple of drinks

01:07:46.344 --> 01:07:47.611
and then I'll drive us home.

01:07:47.613 --> 01:07:50.080
Why are you so nice to me?

01:07:50.082 --> 01:07:52.083
You trusted me with Mia's life.

01:07:52.085 --> 01:07:54.518
That's real.
That means something.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.386
Hmm, I guess so.

01:07:56.388 --> 01:07:57.757
And I trusted you with mine.

01:07:59.859 --> 01:08:00.757
How's that?

01:08:00.759 --> 01:08:02.525
You could have murdered me.

01:08:02.527 --> 01:08:05.096
Why would I murder you?

01:08:05.098 --> 01:08:07.567
Admit it,
you've thought about it.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:12.502
That is a fucked up thing
to joke about.

01:08:12.504 --> 01:08:15.539
It is!

01:08:15.541 --> 01:08:17.640
Oh, my God.

01:08:17.643 --> 01:08:18.776
I need bourbon.

01:08:18.778 --> 01:08:21.344
Bourbon's my drink.

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:48.671
This is it.

01:08:48.674 --> 01:08:51.243
This... this is
my old neighborhood.

01:08:52.278 --> 01:08:54.911
God, I lived here
for nine years.

01:08:54.912 --> 01:08:56.813
Whoa, your molecules
are everywhere.

01:08:56.814 --> 01:09:00.651
It used to not be
this nice, though.

01:09:00.653 --> 01:09:02.618
Look, that's a bakery for dogs.

01:09:02.621 --> 01:09:04.453
What'd it used to be?

01:09:04.456 --> 01:09:06.189
A bakery for humans.

01:09:06.192 --> 01:09:07.691
- Cool.
- I know.

01:09:07.693 --> 01:09:09.595
People ate flour back then.

01:09:13.265 --> 01:09:14.631
Hi. Sorry.

01:09:14.634 --> 01:09:15.865
Two Maker's, neat.

01:09:15.867 --> 01:09:17.500
Sure.
Want water with that?

01:09:17.502 --> 01:09:19.301
No, I'm thirsty, not dirty.

01:09:19.304 --> 01:09:20.569
Okay.

01:09:23.175 --> 01:09:24.307
Hmm.

01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:25.408
God.

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:27.877
I remember when guys used to
look at me like that.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.180
He was looking at you.

01:09:30.183 --> 01:09:32.682
Nobody wants to
fuck mommy, okay?

01:09:32.684 --> 01:09:34.852
There is an entire
genre of porn

01:09:34.854 --> 01:09:37.353
dedicated to exactly that.

01:09:37.354 --> 01:09:39.323
So, let's say you take
a wooden ship

01:09:39.325 --> 01:09:41.457
and you replace one plank
every year.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.859
Well, eventually the ship

01:09:42.862 --> 01:09:45.261
will be made up of
entirely new planks.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:47.298
There'll be nothing left
of the original ship.

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:51.634
So, is it still the same ship
or is it a new ship?

01:09:51.636 --> 01:09:53.337
New ship.

01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:54.737
- Why?
- It just is.

01:09:54.739 --> 01:09:57.307
Nothing is the same.
It's a new ship, baby.

01:09:57.309 --> 01:09:59.610
<i>Nouveau bateau.</i>

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:00.643
Okay.

01:10:00.645 --> 01:10:02.612
So, what about people?

01:10:02.614 --> 01:10:05.848
Most of the cells in your body
have divided and regenerated

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:08.918
since you were a baby.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:12.890
Then I guess I'm just not me
without my original parts.

01:10:12.892 --> 01:10:16.593
Well, there's one part of us
that actually can't regenerate.

01:10:16.595 --> 01:10:17.794
What's that?

01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:20.431
The hearing cells.

01:10:20.433 --> 01:10:21.565
In your ears.

01:10:21.567 --> 01:10:23.336
Yeah, they can't grow back.

01:10:53.398 --> 01:10:55.298
Oh, no, this is, like,

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:57.901
- one of my favorite songs.
- I know.

01:10:57.903 --> 01:10:59.469
Mine, too.
That's why I played it.

01:10:59.471 --> 01:11:04.508
I used to listen to this
with Violet all the time.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.410
We used to live together
here in Bushwick,

01:11:07.412 --> 01:11:08.544
a long time ago.

01:11:08.546 --> 01:11:10.713
But, like, this was our jam.

01:11:10.715 --> 01:11:12.816
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:11:12.818 --> 01:11:14.785
Oh, I loved her.

01:11:14.787 --> 01:11:18.289
I was...
I was really in love with her.

01:11:18.291 --> 01:11:19.823
I wanted...

01:11:19.825 --> 01:11:21.491
- Oh, God.
- What?

01:11:21.493 --> 01:11:22.692
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

01:11:22.694 --> 01:11:23.860
I want to tell you
something and I...

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:26.030
- No, I have to go first.
- Whoa.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.563
Really?
It better be really good,

01:11:27.565 --> 01:11:29.833
- 'cause I'm, like, laying my shit out here.
- Yeah.

01:11:29.835 --> 01:11:32.636
I have to leave.

01:11:32.638 --> 01:11:34.771
Where?

01:11:34.773 --> 01:11:39.310
Uh, I can't work for you
anymore.

01:11:39.312 --> 01:11:41.744
Sorry, I didn't want to
tell you at the house.

01:11:41.746 --> 01:11:43.849
Wait, you're quitting?

01:11:45.451 --> 01:11:47.750
No, you can't quit.

01:11:47.752 --> 01:11:49.986
I have to.

01:11:49.988 --> 01:11:52.323
What, is it another family
or something?

01:11:52.325 --> 01:11:53.990
'Cause I just need you to stay

01:11:53.992 --> 01:11:56.694
a little bit lo-longer,
you know?

01:11:56.696 --> 01:11:58.265
'Cause I need your help.

01:12:00.565 --> 01:12:03.700
Please.

01:12:03.702 --> 01:12:06.038
I can't.

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:12.409
Marlo.

01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:13.779
Oh, Marlo.

01:12:18.017 --> 01:12:19.615
Oh.

01:12:19.617 --> 01:12:21.517
Where are you going?

01:12:21.519 --> 01:12:24.454
- Let me drive you home.
- You can't drive!

01:12:24.456 --> 01:12:25.856
Yes, I'm fine.

01:12:25.858 --> 01:12:27.691
- I promise.
- No, let's just...

01:12:27.693 --> 01:12:30.793
- let's leave the car here and take a cab.
- No.

01:12:30.795 --> 01:12:32.029
- Drew's gonna be angry.
- Why are you doing this?

01:12:32.031 --> 01:12:34.030
Why are you leaving?

01:12:34.032 --> 01:12:34.998
Why?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.802
I was just here
to bridge a gap.

01:12:38.804 --> 01:12:40.940
It's time for me to move on.

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:45.776
Right.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:48.579
I bet you have big plans.

01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:51.048
I mean, your 20s are great.

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:54.785
They are, but then your 30s
come around the corner

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:57.588
like a garbage truck
at 5:00 a.m.

01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:59.423
Yeah.

01:12:59.425 --> 01:13:02.459
What are you gonna do when that
cute little butt of yours drops

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:04.527
and your feet
grow a half a size

01:13:04.529 --> 01:13:09.533
with each pregnancy, and this
whole free spirit thing...

01:13:09.535 --> 01:13:10.933
it stops being charming.

01:13:10.935 --> 01:13:13.102
And it just starts
to look ugly.

01:13:13.104 --> 01:13:14.804
I'm not afraid of the future.

01:13:14.806 --> 01:13:17.173
Oh, my God.
You should be.

01:13:17.175 --> 01:13:19.410
You're convinced that
you're this failure,

01:13:19.412 --> 01:13:20.843
but you actually made
your biggest dream come true.

01:13:20.845 --> 01:13:23.614
- Oh, my... what?
- That sameness

01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:24.882
that you despise.

01:13:24.884 --> 01:13:26.417
That's your gift to them.

01:13:26.419 --> 01:13:28.918
Waking up every day
and doing the same things

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.554
for them over and over.

01:13:31.556 --> 01:13:34.557
You... are boring.
Your marriage is boring.

01:13:34.559 --> 01:13:37.561
Your house is boring,
but that's fucking incredible!

01:13:37.563 --> 01:13:39.929
That's the big dream,

01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:41.765
to grow up and be dull
and constant,

01:13:41.767 --> 01:13:44.200
and then raise your kids
in that circle of safety.

01:13:44.202 --> 01:13:46.803
I'm not safe.
I'm scared!

01:13:46.805 --> 01:13:48.140
Marlo!

01:13:59.652 --> 01:14:01.718
Where are we going?!

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.219
To my old place!

01:14:03.221 --> 01:14:05.088
You don't live there anymore!

01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:30.079
What, there's
a fucking lobby now?

01:14:30.081 --> 01:14:32.115
And furniture?

01:14:32.117 --> 01:14:33.784
- Let's go home.
- No, no, no.

01:14:33.786 --> 01:14:35.151
Violet still lives here.

01:14:35.153 --> 01:14:37.087
She's gonna let us in.

01:14:37.089 --> 01:14:39.021
And she's gonna like you a lot.

01:14:39.023 --> 01:14:42.493
So, just get ready for that.

01:14:42.495 --> 01:14:43.927
I wish I could

01:14:43.929 --> 01:14:46.096
let you stay and go up, but...

01:14:46.098 --> 01:14:48.565
- there's no there anymore.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:51.535
It's right there. Look.

01:14:51.537 --> 01:14:53.503
Come on. Let's go.

01:14:53.505 --> 01:14:54.605
What?

01:14:54.607 --> 01:14:55.573
Hey, this was your idea.

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:57.908
Why the fuck did you
bring me out here then?

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.212
We just came too far out.

01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:08.718
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.253
Whoa.

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:10.954
Hold on.

01:15:10.956 --> 01:15:13.056
- Oh!
- Oh, you're really full.

01:15:13.058 --> 01:15:15.158
- Oh, I need Mia. Oh, fuck.
- Okay.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.860
Let's go home and
I'll-I'll breastfeed her.

01:15:16.862 --> 01:15:18.728
No, you're not gonna feed Mia.

01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:20.062
You're hammered.

01:15:20.064 --> 01:15:22.065
- Um...
- I miss her.

01:15:22.067 --> 01:15:24.535
- No, I'm...
- You're gonna see her soon.

01:15:24.537 --> 01:15:27.771
I know, but she won't
be the same tomorrow.

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:30.774
You said that,
and I don't want her to grow.

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:32.575
Yeah, you do.

01:15:32.577 --> 01:15:35.811
Okay, come here, come here.
Let me get you.

01:15:35.813 --> 01:15:36.946
Okay.

01:15:36.948 --> 01:15:38.080
We're gonna go in here.

01:15:38.082 --> 01:15:39.685
Come on, let's-let's go.

01:15:43.221 --> 01:15:45.222
Excuse me.

01:15:45.224 --> 01:15:46.993
Oh, please, excuse me.

01:15:57.336 --> 01:15:59.136
Okay.

01:16:00.272 --> 01:16:04.575
Take it off.

01:16:04.577 --> 01:16:06.877
Okay.

01:16:06.879 --> 01:16:08.579
Oh, God.

01:16:11.951 --> 01:16:13.683
- Uh-uh.
- No?

01:16:13.685 --> 01:16:15.252
Oh, my...

01:16:15.254 --> 01:16:16.186
Oh, God.

01:16:16.188 --> 01:16:18.955
One second!
We're performing a miracle!

01:16:18.957 --> 01:16:20.958
Okay.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.727
Ah, fuck.

01:16:23.729 --> 01:16:24.761
Okay. Maybe...

01:16:24.763 --> 01:16:26.362
Oh...

01:16:26.364 --> 01:16:27.731
Okay.

01:16:27.733 --> 01:16:28.899
It's not working.

01:16:32.904 --> 01:16:34.706
Okay, here.

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:39.679
Okay.

01:16:43.081 --> 01:16:45.115
Just gonna... do a compress.

01:16:45.117 --> 01:16:46.350
It'll be like a baby's mouth.

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:47.883
Let me sit down.

01:16:47.885 --> 01:16:49.953
Here, come down.

01:16:49.955 --> 01:16:52.888
Okay. Ready?

01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:56.026
Uh-huh.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.261
Okay.

01:16:58.263 --> 01:17:00.062
Now I'm just gonna squeeze,
okay?

01:17:00.064 --> 01:17:01.964
Just a little rubbing motion
like always.

01:17:01.966 --> 01:17:03.799
Okay.

01:17:03.801 --> 01:17:05.302
Ow! Ow.

01:17:05.304 --> 01:17:07.904
- Fuck. Ow!
- It's okay. Just one more.

01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:11.307
- Ow!
- Okay, it's all right.

01:17:11.309 --> 01:17:12.642
God.

01:17:12.644 --> 01:17:14.043
All right.

01:17:15.413 --> 01:17:17.047
Ow! Shit.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:20.086
Okay.

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:27.891
There you go.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:30.063
Oh, yeah.
That feels good.

01:17:33.064 --> 01:17:35.097
Oh, yeah.

01:17:55.854 --> 01:17:58.722
- Stay awake.
- Mm.

01:17:58.724 --> 01:18:00.356
- I'm so tired.
- I know, I know.

01:18:00.358 --> 01:18:02.392
But I need you to stay with me.

01:18:02.394 --> 01:18:04.127
Just...

01:18:04.129 --> 01:18:06.329
let's have a conversation.

01:18:06.331 --> 01:18:08.298
All we do is converse.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:12.134
We're like the people
from a Spanish textbook.

01:18:12.136 --> 01:18:15.237
Maria and Julio,
they never shut up.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:20.413
Oh, what am I going to do
without you?

01:18:21.779 --> 01:18:24.246
You're gonna take care
of yourself.

01:18:24.248 --> 01:18:27.950
You're gonna...
take a shower every day.

01:18:27.952 --> 01:18:31.722
You're gonna... floss.

01:18:31.724 --> 01:18:33.890
You know, you're gonna
get a pedicure

01:18:33.892 --> 01:18:35.258
every once in a while

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.194
even though you hate
having your feet touched.

01:18:37.196 --> 01:18:38.861
That's so corny.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:45.401
Look, we're almost home.

01:18:45.403 --> 01:18:52.075
You have a warm bed
and you have three babies.

01:18:52.077 --> 01:18:55.945
The creaky stair.

01:18:55.947 --> 01:18:59.216
The world's weakest shower.

01:18:59.218 --> 01:19:01.951
It's home.

01:19:01.953 --> 01:19:04.189
Almost there.

01:21:03.642 --> 01:21:06.142
Hi. You are Marlo's husband?

01:21:06.144 --> 01:21:08.078
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Drew.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.879
I'm Dr. Smythe. I'm on
the psychiatric staff here.

01:21:09.881 --> 01:21:11.481
I'd like to talk
to you about Marlo.

01:21:11.483 --> 01:21:13.016
Can we step outside?

01:21:13.018 --> 01:21:14.018
Okay.

01:21:15.386 --> 01:21:18.491
Does she have a history
of mental illness?

01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:22.495
No.

01:21:24.162 --> 01:21:25.661
Well...

01:21:25.663 --> 01:21:28.231
okay, I mean I guess there was
some pretty bad depression

01:21:28.233 --> 01:21:29.365
when our son was born,

01:21:29.367 --> 01:21:31.101
but, I-I mean...

01:21:31.103 --> 01:21:32.668
i-i-it's completely different
this time.

01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:35.204
She's been great.
She's been amazing.

01:21:35.206 --> 01:21:37.073
And you know, uh,
her-her brother

01:21:37.075 --> 01:21:38.909
sprang for a night nanny,

01:21:38.911 --> 01:21:40.477
so she's getting help,
she's getting sleep, she's...

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:43.413
Actually, we think
she's experiencing

01:21:43.415 --> 01:21:46.018
extreme exhaustion
and sleep deprivation.

01:21:47.385 --> 01:21:48.450
Okay.

01:21:48.452 --> 01:21:50.419
I mean, I...

01:21:50.421 --> 01:21:52.521
I don't know how.

01:21:52.523 --> 01:21:55.928
It seems like she's better
than she's ever been.

01:21:58.130 --> 01:22:00.297
I mean, I guess there's been
a couple of moments

01:22:00.299 --> 01:22:02.665
that have been
ou-out of character.

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:05.035
Uh...

01:22:05.037 --> 01:22:06.936
you know,
I wouldn't ever expect her

01:22:06.938 --> 01:22:08.504
to drive drunk
like that, you know,

01:22:08.506 --> 01:22:10.205
or leave the house
without telling me

01:22:10.207 --> 01:22:11.540
so no one's watching the kids.

01:22:11.542 --> 01:22:13.345
Well, weren't you home?

01:22:15.112 --> 01:22:16.413
Yeah.

01:22:16.415 --> 01:22:17.948
Yeah, you're right.
I was home.

01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:19.415
And what about
the night nanny?

01:22:19.417 --> 01:22:21.317
Uh, no.

01:22:21.319 --> 01:22:22.953
I don't know where she was.

01:22:22.955 --> 01:22:25.221
I actually don't really know
that much about her.

01:22:25.223 --> 01:22:27.089
Uh, do you mind if I get back?
I kind of...

01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:29.359
Yeah. Actually they just need
you to finish up some paperwork

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:32.094
at this window right here
and then we'll reconvene.

01:22:32.096 --> 01:22:33.632
Okay. Thank you.

01:22:36.468 --> 01:22:38.301
Uh, Marlo Moreau.

01:22:38.303 --> 01:22:39.468
Yes.

01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:41.170
Do you have
your insurance card?

01:22:41.172 --> 01:22:42.541
Yeah, I do.

01:22:46.077 --> 01:22:47.142
Hey, Drew. How we doing?

01:22:47.144 --> 01:22:48.143
Hey.

01:22:48.145 --> 01:22:49.512
Um... I don't...

01:22:49.514 --> 01:22:50.512
I don't know
what the hell's going on.

01:22:50.514 --> 01:22:52.281
And the patient's
date of birth.

01:22:52.283 --> 01:22:55.185
Uh, 6-7-77.

01:22:55.187 --> 01:22:56.619
Can we see her?

01:22:56.621 --> 01:22:59.054
- Are you still at the same address?
- Yeah.

01:22:59.056 --> 01:23:01.357
- She's, uh... she's still out.
- What is her maiden name?

01:23:01.359 --> 01:23:03.258
So I think...
Uh, Tully.

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.593
T-U-L-L-Y.

01:23:04.595 --> 01:23:06.428
All right.
What-what can we do for you?

01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:08.231
And the last four digits
of her social.

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:09.399
Y-You're doing it.
Um...

01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:23.743
Hey.

01:24:24.776 --> 01:24:26.609
You look a little beat up.

01:24:26.611 --> 01:24:28.511
Well, you should see the river.

01:24:39.858 --> 01:24:43.629
So, obviously, we can't
see each other anymore.

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.767
I don't want you to go.

01:24:50.769 --> 01:24:53.570
Well, I was really just here

01:24:53.572 --> 01:24:55.204
to get you through
the danger zone.

01:24:55.206 --> 01:24:57.774
Yeah, and what am I supposed
to do now?

01:24:57.776 --> 01:25:00.776
Uh, you'll do
what you have to do.

01:25:00.778 --> 01:25:02.514
And then you'll do it again.

01:25:05.349 --> 01:25:08.551
If I'm older,
why are you so much wiser?

01:25:08.553 --> 01:25:11.820
Because I'm 26.

01:25:11.822 --> 01:25:15.827
All I have
is time to think about stuff.

01:25:17.895 --> 01:25:20.262
Such a shame
you're gonna forget it all

01:25:20.264 --> 01:25:22.632
after three pregnancies.

01:25:22.634 --> 01:25:24.400
Not...

01:25:24.402 --> 01:25:26.869
I just started learning
Italian. Do I forget that?

01:25:26.871 --> 01:25:30.272
You'll never get past
"good evening."

01:25:30.274 --> 01:25:31.540
- Mm...
- Sorry.

01:25:31.542 --> 01:25:34.143
Oh.

01:25:36.781 --> 01:25:39.652
Thank you for keeping me alive.

01:25:43.154 --> 01:25:45.690
The same.

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:49.292
Ciao.

01:25:49.294 --> 01:25:50.563
Ciao.

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:15.854
Hi.

01:26:18.556 --> 01:26:20.658
Hi.

01:26:26.297 --> 01:26:27.664
Marlo, I'm so sorry.

01:26:27.666 --> 01:26:29.231
- Why are you sorry?
- I'm just so sorry

01:26:29.233 --> 01:26:31.767
- that I let this happen.
- You didn't do anything.

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:33.770
No, I know,
and that's the problem, okay?

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:35.405
I just... I...

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:38.941
I got overwhelmed
with the kids and-and-and work,

01:26:38.943 --> 01:26:40.944
and I just, I wasn't
taking care of you, and I'm...

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:43.279
I-I didn't understand
what was going on at night.

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:45.384
I thought you...
I thought you were doing great.

01:26:48.486 --> 01:26:51.320
I was doing great. I mean...

01:26:51.322 --> 01:26:53.589
wasn't I great?

01:26:53.591 --> 01:26:54.757
No, fuck that!

01:26:54.759 --> 01:26:55.959
I don't... That's not...

01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:57.893
I don't want
that kind of great.

01:26:57.895 --> 01:27:01.396
All right?
I just... I just want you.

01:27:01.398 --> 01:27:05.236
I just want you to be okay.

01:27:08.607 --> 01:27:10.973
You know, if you want to...

01:27:10.975 --> 01:27:14.410
run off or something, I...

01:27:14.412 --> 01:27:15.677
I mean, I get that, I...

01:27:15.679 --> 01:27:17.347
'cause I want to do that
too, sometimes,

01:27:17.349 --> 01:27:19.915
but I'm not gonna.

01:27:23.354 --> 01:27:25.957
I love us.

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:33.431
I love us, too.

01:28:10.868 --> 01:28:12.871
All right. You ready?

01:28:15.572 --> 01:28:17.977
Okay. Come sit down.

01:28:18.977 --> 01:28:21.313
Let's do your arms.

01:28:22.447 --> 01:28:24.315
Okay.

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:26.949
You ready?

01:28:26.951 --> 01:28:29.418
Mom, is this real?

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:31.820
What do you mean?

01:28:31.822 --> 01:28:34.359
I'm not sure
what it's supposed to do.

01:28:35.827 --> 01:28:38.960
Well, honestly, I don't know.

01:28:38.962 --> 01:28:40.862
Do you like it when we do it?

01:28:40.864 --> 01:28:42.899
I like being by you.

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:45.968
I like being by you, too.

01:28:45.970 --> 01:28:48.003
And it feels nice, I guess.

01:28:48.005 --> 01:28:50.742
Well, maybe
it's all that matters.

01:28:52.711 --> 01:28:54.813
Maybe we don't need the brush.

01:28:57.715 --> 01:28:59.751
Okay.

01:29:02.354 --> 01:29:03.389
Okay.

01:29:05.456 --> 01:29:08.357
I love you.

01:29:12.096 --> 01:29:14.399
I love you, too.
