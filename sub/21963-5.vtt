00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.754
Yesterday
two teenagers reported seeing

00:20.788 --> 00:23.491
this elderly gentlemen
disintegrate before their eyes

00:23.524 --> 00:26.026
-into a pile of dust and bones.
-Dust and bones?

00:26.060 --> 00:28.329
Sounds to me like a classic case

00:28.362 --> 00:30.231
of teen one-upsmanship.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.899
"Oh, hey. I made out
with this girl last night."

00:31.932 --> 00:34.402
"Oh, really? I made out
with a girl last night, too.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.036
"And some old man

00:36.070 --> 00:38.372
disintegrated
right in front of us."

00:38.406 --> 00:40.274
-Are you done, Leroy?
-Yes, I am.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.210
We tested the bones
and identified the man

00:42.243 --> 00:43.577
as Dan Brewster.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.845
Now, here's where
it gets interesting.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.747
This was Dan one week ago.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.282
He was 25 years old.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.451
-What?
-(computer chimes)

00:50.484 --> 00:51.619
-Barry, did you just like
his photo? -Mm-hmm.

00:51.652 --> 00:55.189
One last like
for my main man Dan.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.291
So, a person aging decades
in a matter of days.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.959
Is it just a severe case
of progeria?

00:58.992 --> 01:02.062
I mean, have you ever seen
anything like this before?

01:02.096 --> 01:03.231
No, we have never seen
anything like it.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.798
MAX:
Sorry, Leroy.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.033
Uh, progeria is a disease

01:06.066 --> 01:07.301
where the cells in the body

01:07.335 --> 01:08.602
go through their life cycle

01:08.636 --> 01:10.538
at an accelerated rate.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.273
You think you're the only one
who knows what progeria means?

01:12.306 --> 01:14.208
We've all seen
Benjamin Buttons, bro.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.309
Well, actually, Benjamin Buttons

01:15.343 --> 01:16.610
is just the opposite.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.778
-So, rewind it.
-What?

01:17.811 --> 01:18.946
What are we,
watching it on a VCR?

01:18.979 --> 01:19.980
What's going on?

01:20.013 --> 01:21.382
What's wrong with VCR?

01:21.415 --> 01:22.550
-You have a VCR?
-Yeah.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.817
What movies do you have?

01:23.851 --> 01:25.486
-I got all the Rockys. Uh-huh.
-Rockys?

01:25.519 --> 01:26.820
-The Rocky movies?
-Yeah.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.055
-Do you have Rocky I?
-Mm-hmm.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.089
-II? III?
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.291
-IV?
-Mm-hmm.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.492
-V? Rocky Balboa?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.493
-Creed?
-Yeah.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.494
Sweet.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.329
Before he died,

01:35.363 --> 01:37.265
Dan was a caddie
at the Copper Glen Country Club.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.932
That's where
he was last seen alive.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.668
Now, he caddied
for this gentleman,

01:40.701 --> 01:42.069
Stafford Yates,

01:42.102 --> 01:43.671
who is the wealthy CEO

01:43.704 --> 01:45.005
of Vaia Pharmaceuticals.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.574
They concentrate their research

01:46.607 --> 01:48.309
on the area of antiaging.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.478
So, this Yates person
wants to do

01:50.511 --> 01:52.180
fountain-of-youth testing

01:52.213 --> 01:54.014
by kidnapping human guinea pigs?

01:54.047 --> 01:55.916
Maybe. That's what
we're gonna find out.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.085
You two are going undercover
at the country club.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.687
I want you
to track Stafford Yates.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.290
Find out what he knows
about Brewster's disappearance.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.524
Oh, and, uh, one more thing.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.093
You're using
two separate covers.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.095
One of you is a member.
The other is a caddie.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.331
BOTH:
Member.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.366
*

02:15.369 --> 02:16.637
Okay, how about this? How about

02:16.670 --> 02:18.706
we take turns
carrying the clubs?

02:18.739 --> 02:20.174
Max, you're the caddie.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.375
The caddie carries clubs.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.377
Well, yeah, traditionally.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.878
But, I mean,
how about we develop

02:24.912 --> 02:26.347
a new kind of caddie...

02:26.380 --> 02:29.183
golf boss relationship?

02:29.217 --> 02:31.118
Hey, you're lucky.
You got off easy.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.153
I'm the one who got stuck
with the hard job.

02:33.187 --> 02:36.156
Traipsing around as one
of these upper-class jerks.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.725
Rich people are the worst.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.893
Leroy, listen, you're gonna have
to keep an open mind, okay?

02:39.927 --> 02:41.662
I mean, some of these people
are perfectly lovely.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.497
For instance,
I have a rich uncle.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.165
Uncle Petey. He was the best.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.967
He had this huge house, right?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.202
Have us come over,

02:48.236 --> 02:49.737
let us trim the hedges,

02:49.770 --> 02:52.072
let us rake up the leaves
into these giant piles.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.875
He'd-he'd let us
push the lawn mowers around.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.511
I mean, it was a special time.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.047
You were an unpaid
child gardener.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.816
What?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.652
Stafford? Stafford Yates?

03:04.685 --> 03:07.688
Ha! It really is you.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.523
As I live and breathe.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.724
Do I know you?

03:10.758 --> 03:12.593
You wish. Leroy Wright.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.395
-What's up?
-How's it going?

03:14.428 --> 03:17.164
I go way back with Kurt Downing.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.400
When I told him I was moving
my import-export business

03:19.433 --> 03:22.035
-to town for taxes...
-(all laugh)

03:22.069 --> 03:24.004
he told me
about this second-rate pigsty.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.273
Figured I'd come check it out.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.774
(chuckles) Okay.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.377
Well, this is
Campbell McMasters.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.445
-He's the president of the club.
-Hey-oh.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.213
Kurt's been a great friend

03:33.247 --> 03:35.283
-of this "second-rate pigsty."
-(all laugh)

03:35.316 --> 03:37.785
LEROY:
Hey, Yates.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.253
You gonna hit the ball,
or have you gone blind

03:39.287 --> 03:41.188
staring at Campbell's
idiotic watch?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.856
(all laugh)

03:42.890 --> 03:45.393
Golf bosses.
Bunch of windbags, right?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.428
Rather hang with my boys.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.300
-Oh, is that me?
-Yeah, big-time.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.368
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
-Oh. (chuckles)

03:54.402 --> 03:56.370
Hey, you caddie
for Stafford, right?

03:56.404 --> 03:57.638
-What's he like?
-He's fine.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.773
-I mean, I barely know him.
-Same.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.142
Same. Yeah, yeah.
No, I-I don't know that guy.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.711
We're not best friends.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.280
There aren't any songs
that remind me of him.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.783
-Right.
-Hey.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.820
Uh, do you have any advice
for the new guy?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.822
Yeah. Don't work here.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.424
What do you mean?

04:16.457 --> 04:19.259
There's a really high turnover
for caddies here.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.730
Some of them kind of...
disappear.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.632
-What are you talking about?
-Shh.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.234
Not here.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.169
-You mean, like,
no talking at all? Or... -Shh.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.471
Tell you what, the feds

04:30.504 --> 04:32.740
are all up my ass
over these African gazelles

04:32.773 --> 04:34.141
I want to bring over here.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.576
Regulations are killing me.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.578
I killed one of those.
They're beautiful.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.012
But I hear you
on the regulations.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.781
Damn FDA.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.816
-Used to be all over us at Vaia.
-How is the pharmaceutical game?

04:42.850 --> 04:44.752
(laughing):
What?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.788
You think they let him work
at a pharmaceutical company?

04:47.821 --> 04:49.823
(chuckles) Yeah, I got kicked
off the board about a year ago

04:49.857 --> 04:51.692
for making a porno in my office.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.294
They called me
"grossly incompetent."

04:54.328 --> 04:56.330
I'm like,
"No, I'm not. You are!"

04:56.364 --> 04:58.298
Killer comeback.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.700
(laughing):
Yeah, I'm that good.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.068
Okay.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.104
Pretty good strike.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.673
-Sliced it.
-I did.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.608
-It's not a tomato, Yates.
-(chuckles)

05:07.641 --> 05:10.277
How am I gonna get that
in the bushes?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.612
CAMPBELL: That's what
a caddie's for, isn't it?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.146
STAFFORD:
Man, I hate this game.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.983
-CAMPBELL: Come on, caddie.
-Sorry.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.818
It turns out that another caddie

05:17.851 --> 05:19.487
disappeared from Copper Glen
a few years ago.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.655
A pattern emerges.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.324
You know, I used to belong to
one of these places growing up.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.993
These people
are literally the worst.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.528
I would not be surprised
if they're actually running

05:27.561 --> 05:28.829
these tests on these kids.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.364
Wait, so you're rich?
But last weekend

05:30.398 --> 05:31.499
you said you couldn't afford

05:31.532 --> 05:32.733
to do karaoke
with me and my roomies.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.735
Okay, last time I did karaoke
with you guys,

05:34.768 --> 05:37.137
Miriam told me that
if I couldn't hit a high "C,"

05:37.170 --> 05:39.306
then I shouldn't bother
trying to sing Mariah.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.142
Here's what I want to know:
how rich are we talking?

05:42.175 --> 05:44.378
Plane or boat?

05:44.412 --> 05:46.747
* Helicopter... *

05:46.780 --> 05:47.915
Okay, sorry, just...

05:47.948 --> 05:49.550
Maybe Miriam was right.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.419
(whispering):
Helicopter?

05:51.452 --> 05:53.353
All right, I'll catch up
with you losers later.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.755
-All right.
-I got to tip my caddie.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.089
Sometimes I give mine extra

05:56.123 --> 05:57.558
to do a little dance. Caddie?

05:57.591 --> 05:59.326
-Uh-oh.
-Oh...

05:59.359 --> 06:00.894
-Come on, now.
-(laughs) -Man, don't do it.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.430
-Here we go.
-Ricky, don't.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.232
Hold the line. Just don't do it.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.434
-(chanting): Dance, dance.
-Here we go.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.435
-Dance, dance.
-Here we go.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.869
-Dance, dance, dance.
-Here we go.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.538
(all cheer, laugh)

06:12.272 --> 06:13.874
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Oh, there it is.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.609
It's gonna get away from you.
It's gonna get away from you.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.745
-There you go. -Yeah.
-Come on, come on.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.380
There you go.
There you go. (chuckles)

06:20.414 --> 06:23.283
(all laugh)

06:23.316 --> 06:25.018
LEROY:
Top-notch, Stafford.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.854
Nothing funnier
than destroying a man's dignity.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.689
-(both laugh)
-My caddie's so stupid,

06:28.722 --> 06:30.791
he thinks Nasdaq is a rapper.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.292
(laughter)

06:32.325 --> 06:33.293
He thinks Waterford Crystal

06:33.326 --> 06:35.295
is a stripper from Connecticut.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.097
Look at him.
I think he actually does

06:37.130 --> 06:39.633
-think that.
-He does! Look at his face.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.302
He still wears his wedding ring,
and his wife ran out on him--

06:42.335 --> 06:43.771
-twice! -CAMPBELL: Wait, wait.
Same wife?

06:43.804 --> 06:45.473
LEROY: You think he could afford
a second one?

06:45.506 --> 06:47.808
-(all laugh)
-All right. Be good.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.209
Take care, guys.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.044
(laughter)

06:51.078 --> 06:53.313
STAFFORD:
Oh, that's sad.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.315
-Hey, man.
-Hey, buddy.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.784
Getting a little personal

06:56.817 --> 06:58.486
with the roast battle there,
don't you think?

06:58.519 --> 06:59.820
Dude, we're undercover.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.155
Okay.

07:02.189 --> 07:05.258
I mean... maybe I was wrong.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.894
Rich guys are terrible.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.262
Maybe, but Stafford's
definitely not our guy.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.332
He's way, way too dumb
to be a mad scientist.

07:12.365 --> 07:15.135
Okay, well, something is up,
because Ricky was freaked out.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.638
He was like...

07:17.671 --> 07:19.507
He wanted you
to spoon-feed him applesauce?

07:19.540 --> 07:21.108
No, he was scared.
That's a scared face.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.510
He's like...

07:22.543 --> 07:24.978
-This is a scared face.
-Oh.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.446
You're actually right.
That's super good.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.248
(horn honking)

07:28.281 --> 07:29.783
-(tires screech)
-Look out!

07:29.817 --> 07:31.585
Oh, my God.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.687
(leg snaps)

07:33.721 --> 07:35.956
Honest mistake.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.458
Um, what's up with Campbell?

07:38.492 --> 07:41.562
There's walking it off,
and there's walking it off.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.100
And his leg, it just...

07:47.134 --> 07:49.369
it bent back into place again.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.338
I can't emphasize
how messed up it is,

07:51.371 --> 07:53.340
like a movie
I can't stop watching.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.442
I just want the movie to end.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.210
MAX:
Okay, so, the old man--

07:57.244 --> 07:59.112
the one that disintegrated
in front of the teenagers--

07:59.146 --> 08:00.948
if he was indeed rapidly aging,

08:00.981 --> 08:04.017
all that energy
must have gone somewhere.

08:04.051 --> 08:08.155
And if Campbell can heal
just as quickly, it suggests

08:08.188 --> 08:09.557
some sort of transfer.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.991
-Maybe.
-LaFREY: Well, it certainly

08:11.024 --> 08:13.126
doesn't sound like
a coincidence.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.695
You know what
it does sound like?

08:14.728 --> 08:17.831
The Cronos machine.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.466
Right?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.568
What?

08:21.569 --> 08:23.370
Cronos machine.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.472
Do you seriously not know
what a Cronos machine is?

08:25.505 --> 08:26.974
(mouths)

08:27.007 --> 08:29.009
Okay, well...

08:31.378 --> 08:34.848
There are ancient legends
in South American folklore

08:34.882 --> 08:36.483
of the Cronos machine,

08:36.516 --> 08:38.351
designed to perfect and heal
the human body.

08:38.385 --> 08:42.923
Only problem was, they were
built within sacred trees

08:42.956 --> 08:46.193
with powers of invincibility,
but also evil.

08:46.226 --> 08:50.030
Their ultimate goal:
immortality.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.099
You saying "cronuts" machine?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.602
Cronos machine.
It's an immortality machine.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.204
The donut with the croissant,
it's a hybrid.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.505
-Man, there ain't no Cronos...
-LaFREY: All right,

08:58.538 --> 09:01.041
Leroy, there's a party
at Copper Glen tonight.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.843
You're going to attend.
Once you're in,

09:02.876 --> 09:05.345
break off, and find out whatever
you can about this Campbell guy,

09:05.378 --> 09:07.047
-so nobody else gets hurt.
-Got it.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.515
LaFREY:
Annie, you're gonna go

09:08.548 --> 09:10.517
as his wife, all right?
You know the terrain,

09:10.550 --> 09:11.885
and you can blend in
with the rich crowd.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.086
Ooh, I bet she will.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.254
LaFREY:
Max,

09:14.287 --> 09:15.789
-you'll be going as a waiter.
-MAX: Oh, great.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.358
I guess, uh, instead of
passing out clubs,

09:18.391 --> 09:20.961
I'll be passing out
club sandwiches.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.933
No, do you... I...

09:25.966 --> 09:27.801
-Do you get it, 'cause...
-Yes, everyone got it.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.870
It's not hard to get.
Let's go to work.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.939
(jazz music playing)

09:31.972 --> 09:34.241
CAMPBELL:
Leroy.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.610
Please, I want you to meet

09:36.644 --> 09:38.578
the love of my life, Monica.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.614
-LEROY: Charmed.
-Well...

09:40.648 --> 09:43.416
And you must be Chantreuse, yes?

09:43.450 --> 09:46.053
-Chantreuse. Okay.
-(Leroy chuckles)

09:46.086 --> 09:47.287
-And, Campbell...
-Mm-hmm?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.489
-Ugly watch, as always.
-(Annie laughs)

09:49.522 --> 09:51.625
-Tease him about his watch,
honey. -Oh, I like it.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.493
Doesn't seem like you're
overcompensating at all.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.762
-(laughs)
-LEROY: That's my girl.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.929
Oh. Oh, I like her.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.666
I love her.
I love you.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.768
Oh, well, let's go chat.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.235
Let the boys be boys.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.504
-I spy a dessert tray.
-Ooh.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.340
(singsongy):
Lemon bars.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.575
Tuna tartare, anyone?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.177
Excuse me, um...

10:10.210 --> 10:13.513
Gee, but...
where do I know you from?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.115
Um...

10:15.148 --> 10:17.350
No, I don't think...
I'm one of three triplets...

10:17.384 --> 10:20.153
Wait a minute. Well, no, no.
Now I remember. Yes, yes.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.755
You're the waiter
I'm gonna have fired

10:21.789 --> 10:23.490
the next time he interrupts me.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.325
Right, of course.
Yes, I'm so sorry, sir.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.527
(chuckles)
Get out of here, stupid.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.265
But will Campbell even notice
that I look great in this dress?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.500
Of course not.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.936
-Mm.
-He's probably off

10:35.969 --> 10:39.639
in the secret room
doing the P90X or whatever.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.375
(chuckles)
I'm sorry, what was that?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.712
Mm. P90X.

10:44.745 --> 10:48.548
It's an exercise routine
popularized by Paul Ryan...

10:48.581 --> 10:51.618
No, I'm sorry, just before that,
you were saying something...

10:51.651 --> 10:53.553
There's-there's a secret room?

10:53.586 --> 10:56.156
Mm. Yeah. It's downstairs.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.658
I'm not allowed in it,
of course.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.494
(à la Campbell):
"You belong in three rooms:

11:01.528 --> 11:04.331
the kitchen, the bedroom,
and the doll room."

11:05.565 --> 11:07.534
Uh, we can't have children,

11:07.567 --> 11:12.205
so I just have a room
full of 300 dolls.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.641
(chuckles uncomfortably)

11:14.674 --> 11:16.810
(quietly): Leroy, there's
a secret room downstairs.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.879
-I'm coming towards you.
-...my factories

11:18.912 --> 11:20.881
for multiple
human rights violations,

11:20.914 --> 11:23.650
but the important thing is
we were never convicted.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.019
That's the important thing.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.021
-Hello, men. -Hello!
-We're back!

11:28.055 --> 11:32.659
Honey, did you know
that Chartreuse has children?

11:32.692 --> 11:37.230
Real ones, not the kind with
the glass eyes and the stuffing.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.833
-Excuse me. I... have to use
the little boys' room. -Oh.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.601
Excuse me.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.271
Keep Campbell occupied.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.705
I'm gonna slip
into the members area downstairs

11:45.739 --> 11:47.107
and see what I can find.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.111
MAX: Hey, it's Max.
Leroy, this sounds like

11:51.144 --> 11:52.780
a great plan.
Side note, we should use

11:52.813 --> 11:54.381
these new comm devices
all the time.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.116
They're super cool. Over.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.551
Max, stay off the comm
unless it's for the mission.

11:58.585 --> 12:01.755
-And you don't need
to say "over." -Copy that.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.858
-I'll do "mout" instead
of "over," okay? Mout. -"Mout"?

12:04.892 --> 12:07.094
Yeah, it's a combination
of "Max" and "out,"

12:07.127 --> 12:09.696
so you'll know it's me. Mout.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.198
I don't like it.
Sounds too much like "mouth."

12:11.231 --> 12:12.699
-Don't do it.
-ANNIE: Guys, stop.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.035
We're just gonna use "over."
Over.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.237
Okay, well, that's what
I initially wanted, so great.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.306
Mout. I mean, over. Sorry.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.708
I've got something downstairs
in the cellar

12:21.741 --> 12:23.977
-you are gonna love.
-(Annie chuckles)

12:24.011 --> 12:25.745
-$20,000.
-Oh!

12:25.779 --> 12:28.148
Well, no, no. You don't need
to get it right now.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.384
Just-just get me a cheap box
of pinot greesh, I'm good.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.120
-Right?
-Right? You get it.

12:33.153 --> 12:36.656
-I get it. -She gets it.
I am obsessed with her.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.259
You are my spirit animal.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.761
-Oh, but do go get
the $20,000 bottle. -Mm.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.464
Oh, no, it's fine.
Please don't. It's okay.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.900
Hey, Campbell is headed
downstairs towards Leroy.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.635
-Max, we got to stop him.
-Okay.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.670
With pleasure.

12:50.703 --> 12:54.007
-Oh, no! I am... so sorry.
-(gasping)

12:54.041 --> 12:57.644
-You stupid idiot!
-Oh, my God. Here you go.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.646
Wait a minute! I remember you.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.181
You're not just a lousy waiter.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.782
You're a lousy caddie,
aren't you?

13:02.816 --> 13:05.352
Security, come and get this guy!

13:05.385 --> 13:08.421
Well, you're just a rich
butthead who cheats at golf!

13:08.455 --> 13:10.323
-I don't cheat at golf.
-Yeah, you do!

13:10.357 --> 13:11.992
I do not. He gave me that putt!

13:12.025 --> 13:13.426
That was for Ricky!

13:13.460 --> 13:16.830
Up with the caddies!
Down with the rich!

13:16.864 --> 13:19.833
Abort, Leroy, abort. I'm
so sorry. I couldn't hold him.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.669
Mout. I mean, over. God.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.205
Guys,
I've got pictures of Campbell

13:25.238 --> 13:26.506
from tons of different eras.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.775
It's like the guy's been alive
for...

13:28.808 --> 13:30.677
hundreds of years.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.046
-(static)
-Guys?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.018
-(line ringing)
-BARRY: Leroy.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.153
Barry, some freaky stuff
is going on.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.388
I'm gonna send you some photos.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.356
Um, it'll be my honor, Leroy.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.357
While you're on the phone,

13:44.391 --> 13:45.458
I just wanted to say I did

13:45.492 --> 13:47.460
a little bit of research
into your name,

13:47.494 --> 13:49.662
and it turns out
that "Leroy" means

13:49.696 --> 13:50.864
-"the k..."
-(beep)

13:50.898 --> 13:52.299
(dial tone)

13:52.332 --> 13:54.634
Yes, I'll be your friend, Leroy!

13:54.667 --> 13:56.536
(chuckles)

13:56.569 --> 13:59.306
Silly. He j...
he just had to ask.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.009
So, I mean, I told him
that he, like, cheats at golf,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.011
which I think, for these guys,
is a pretty sick burn, so...

14:04.044 --> 14:05.045
-Yeah!
-Yeah?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.846
Yes. Well done.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.181
-Yeah? Really?
-Totally.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.216
-Yeah. (laughs)
-Okay, good.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.984
Good, good, good, good, good.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.753
-Oh...
-What?

14:13.786 --> 14:15.388
Nothing. I just...
I just noticed

14:15.422 --> 14:17.390
you don't have on
your wedding ring.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.692
-Not that you should or
you shouldn't. -Yeah, no, I...

14:19.726 --> 14:21.061
-I just... Noticing.
-Yeah.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.263
I didn't think it was right
for my waiter character,

14:23.296 --> 14:26.533
-so... You know, undercover
and stuff. -Mm. Mm-hmm.

14:29.769 --> 14:33.073
I mean, also, my wife did slam
my head against a table

14:33.106 --> 14:35.708
and tell me not to look for her.

14:39.146 --> 14:42.249
But mostly it was
a character choice.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.384
Makes sense.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.718
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:45.752 --> 14:48.088
-Well, yeah.
-All right. Boom.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.789
(both laugh)

14:49.822 --> 14:51.291
(camera shutter clicks)

14:57.597 --> 14:59.232
Damn, Campbell.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.501
What are you,
some kind of vampire?

15:05.238 --> 15:08.141
-Barry, have you spoken to
Leroy? -Uh, yes, many times.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.809
In the six weeks
that I've known him,

15:09.842 --> 15:11.744
we've spoken together
every day.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.613
Recently, Barry, recently.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.748
Have you spoken to him?
We can't get him on the comm.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.084
Oh, yes.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.486
-He sent over some photos.
-What photos?

15:19.519 --> 15:22.322
Well, I'll send them over now.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.124
What? No.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.993
Not "Barry's Sweet Vacay Pics."

15:26.026 --> 15:27.927
Um, oh, stop it.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.329
What are you doing?

15:29.362 --> 15:31.965
-What's going on, Barry?
-Uh, sorry.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.001
Th-The program's
just a bit buggy.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.836
-Spring break! Spring break!
-(whooping)

15:36.869 --> 15:37.937
Oh, my G... Oh, geez.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.139
Horny bitches!

15:39.172 --> 15:40.173
Just... Can we...

15:40.207 --> 15:41.941
(whooping and shouting)

15:41.975 --> 15:43.443
-(murmuring) -Get your hand...
Get... stop it.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.512
Horny bitches!

15:45.545 --> 15:48.982
LaFREY: We've confirmed
that's Campbell in both photos.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.218
Horny bitches.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.021
So if that's true,

15:54.054 --> 15:58.458
that would mean that Campbell's
at least... 150 years old.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.961
I mean, he doesn't look
a day over 65.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.430
Let me see it again.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.999
Annie, there's
something else here.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.467
Oh, no.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.869
We got to get back inside.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.204
Okay, but I just got
kicked out of there.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.140
I mean, how am I gonna
get back in?

16:22.349 --> 16:25.518
Thought you had me, didn't you?

16:25.552 --> 16:27.887
But, as it turns out,

16:27.920 --> 16:29.456
I had you.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.823
What is this?

16:30.857 --> 16:32.359
What the hell are you doing?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.793
Leroy,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.495
I am a very well-connected man.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.330
You must have known
that I would discover

16:37.364 --> 16:40.400
that you're a 15-year veteran
of the LAPD.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.303
You don't get to be
180 years old

16:43.336 --> 16:45.238
by being dumb.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.973
And now, Leroy,

16:47.006 --> 16:49.242
time to have a little
blood drawn.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.811
Unbelievable. So it's totally
fine that I come in now,

16:51.844 --> 16:53.746
because I'm with a rich person.
It's disgusting.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.648
Well, whatever.
You love it.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.251
Well, yeah, I mean, in this
situation it's very helpful.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.652
Okay, so how do we find Leroy?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.088
I mean, it's a secret room.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.589
It's a secret.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.191
Oh, I will find it.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.025
Believe me, I know these places.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.094
There's always an item

17:07.127 --> 17:10.097
that reveals a secret door.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.733
Like an oddly placed
wall sconce.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.208
Or the wall sconce is just
a poor design choice.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.077
LEROY:
What are you doing?

17:24.111 --> 17:26.045
Oh, relax. I'm just
prepping the machine.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.581
LEROY:
The chair's the machine?

17:28.615 --> 17:30.617
Am I sitting in some damn
cronuts device?

17:30.650 --> 17:32.685
Cro-nos. Cronos.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.687
And since you're familiar
with it, well, then,

17:34.721 --> 17:36.589
you already know
that it's your blood

17:36.623 --> 17:38.625
that's gonna keep me
young and pretty.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.094
Campbell,
I'm a very unhealthy eater.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.463
-My go-to breakfast is
a block of cheddar. -Mm-hmm.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.098
I just bite right into it
like an apple.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.534
Lunch is a bucket of bacon
and a stick of butter.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.901
Damn it, Campbell,

17:48.935 --> 17:51.271
if you Cronos me,
I will beat your ass.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.773
-Do you hear me?
-CAMPBELL: Mmm.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.776
Stop Cronosizing me,
you crazy, ancient idiot!

17:56.809 --> 17:58.811
(Leroy screams)

17:58.845 --> 18:01.781
-Okay, wait. That was Leroy.
-(Leroy screams in distance)

18:01.814 --> 18:03.783
-Right?
-LEROY: Stop it!

18:03.816 --> 18:05.452
Oh, it's so obvious.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.154
-Here we go.
-No.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.921
No. Stop it!

18:14.093 --> 18:16.496
No, please, don't.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.665
-MAX: Oh, my God, a Cronos
machine. I knew it. -(grunts)

18:20.700 --> 18:22.635
Shwa! I told you, bitch.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.004
Oh, that's right,
you indestructible.

18:25.037 --> 18:28.107
(grunts)

18:28.141 --> 18:29.242
(Max shouting)

18:29.276 --> 18:30.843
(groans)

18:32.845 --> 18:34.481
(shouts)

18:40.520 --> 18:41.954
(grunts)

18:42.489 --> 18:44.624
(sighs)

18:45.725 --> 18:47.694
-(groans)
-MAX: Hey!

18:52.165 --> 18:55.302
Leroy... the machine.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.138
The machine!
(groans)

18:59.172 --> 19:00.707
(pants)

19:01.341 --> 19:02.309
CAMPBELL:
No.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.043
Go on.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.479
-It's not working!
-The tree.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.847
-Get the tree.
-You said the machine!

19:07.880 --> 19:11.017
-I meant the tree.
-(grunts)

19:11.918 --> 19:12.985
(groans)

19:16.155 --> 19:17.690
-No!
-(grunts)

19:17.724 --> 19:19.726
(screams)

19:22.695 --> 19:24.697
(Max and Leroy panting)

19:26.199 --> 19:27.634
MAX:
Oh, my God.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.402
Think LaFrey will be pissed
I broke the Cronos?

19:29.436 --> 19:31.304
Why would she? She didn't
even know what it was.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.505
Yeah, she'll be fine.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.007
Somebody had to put an end
to the Cronos-ing.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.709
You know, that's not really
the proper use of the word.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.511
Cut me some slack.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.013
Never claimed to be
a Cronos-ologist.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.349
Okay, not to nitpick, but still

19:42.382 --> 19:43.716
not exactly
the right terminology.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.852
You know what?
I'll cut you some slack.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.220
Thank you for saving my life.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.556
Wow. Could have led with that.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.862
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.697
Hey, look, uh...

19:57.730 --> 20:00.199
I know I went a little too far
with that joke about your wife

20:00.233 --> 20:03.002
back at the golf course,
and I just wanted to apologize.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.172
Oh, there's no need. I know it
was just Rich Leroy talking.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.707
Plus, I was pretty
deep undercover

20:07.740 --> 20:09.376
as Max the Caddie, so...

20:09.409 --> 20:11.911
Well, if you happen to see
Max the Caddie,

20:11.944 --> 20:15.181
-tell him Rich Leroy would
also like to apologize. -Okay.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.683
Well, on behalf
of Max the Caddie,

20:16.716 --> 20:18.217
I accept your apol...

20:18.251 --> 20:19.852
-You know what? Can we just
drop this? -Yes, please.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.723
Turns out, I think
you were right.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.892
It's probably time
for me to move on.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.395
I like that idea.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.096
-You're gonna be okay, man.
-Thanks.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.598
LaFREY:
I cannot believe the two of you

20:31.631 --> 20:34.534
destroyed the Cronos machine.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.235
-I had to destroy it
to save Max. -MAX: Yeah.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.738
I almost died, so whatever
blood I had left,

20:38.771 --> 20:40.206
it would have been
on your hands.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.608
At least you could have tried
to do both.

20:41.641 --> 20:44.043
Do you guys ever think
about what you would do

20:44.076 --> 20:46.212
-if you could live forever?
-MAX: Ooh, I think I would just

20:46.245 --> 20:48.815
-read for 200 years.
-Yes.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.217
If you're immortal,
and an alligator eats you,

20:51.250 --> 20:52.619
like, what happens?

20:52.652 --> 20:54.321
Could somebody walk me
through the rules?

20:54.354 --> 20:55.922
Yeah, do you just live inside
the alligator

20:55.955 --> 20:58.425
until it dies,
or are you digested?

20:58.458 --> 20:59.826
And what if the
alligator's immortal?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.127
-What then?
-MAX: Oh, my God.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.629
I don't know.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.664
That's the thing is that
you don't know.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.166
My great aunt
lived to be 119 years old.

21:07.199 --> 21:10.136
But she said the last 40 years
were mostly coughing.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.804
Oh, that's really sweet.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.741
BARRY:
I-I know this may be lame,

21:14.774 --> 21:16.343
but if we're all immortal,

21:16.376 --> 21:18.445
I'd want to spend eternity
with you people.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.581
Everybody in for a group hug.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.015
Come on.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.117
-Come on. My eyes are closed.
-LaFREY: Barry.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.786
There's no shame in it.
Come on, enter my arms.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.521
That's it. Whole group.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.790
I'm just gonna stay here
until the group hug's complete.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.493
Ooh. Okay. Yes.

21:33.526 --> 21:37.464
This sounds, sounds like Leroy's
tip-tippy toes tapping...

21:37.497 --> 21:39.466
There you are.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.471
