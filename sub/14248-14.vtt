WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:07.294
He hasn't left me with a single shot.

00:07.466 --> 00:10.336
- In that case, call a safety.
- Safety?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.550
It's a defensive strategy.

00:12.721 --> 00:18.600
You can't make a shot, so leave
the cue ball where Tuvok can't either.

00:18.227 --> 00:22.271
- That sounds cowardly.
- Suit yourself, pal.

00:22.439 --> 00:27.350
But if you leave Vulcan Slim with
an open shot, he'll run the table.

00:27.528 --> 00:32.106
All right. Safety.

00:38.622 --> 00:42.833
Let's see you reason
your way out of this conundrum.

00:43.100 --> 00:48.588
This safety business is satisfying.
I've left him with an impossible shot.

00:48.757 --> 00:53.419
The shot may be difficult,
but "impossible" is an exaggeration.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.347
Go ahead, then. Call your shot.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.881
If I strike the cue ball properly,

01:00.600 --> 01:03.511
it will deflect off the rear bumper,
then the side,

01:03.689 --> 01:07.105
then cause the eleven ball
to roll into the corner pocket.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.399
This I have to see.

01:17.661 --> 01:21.279
Perhaps the ship's stabilisers
are not operating efficiently.

01:21.456 --> 01:27.874
Maybe Tom Terrific here forgot to
mention that the table runs to the east.

01:28.460 --> 01:30.860
You should have called a safety.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.507
Neelix, please report to the bridge.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.348
You wanted to see me, Captain?

01:44.521 --> 01:47.641
We've received a message
from an approaching vessel.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.307
- They're asking for you.
- Me?

01:50.485 --> 01:56.773
- The ship is entering visual range.
- Slow to impulse. On screen.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.901
Do you recognise it?

02:02.800 --> 02:06.244
- That's a Haakonian shuttle.
- Haakonian?

02:06.418 --> 02:11.294
My people were at war with them
for almost a decade.

02:11.465 --> 02:18.179
They conquered my Homeworld
more than 15 years ago.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.513
What would the Haakonians
want with you now?

02:21.683 --> 02:24.637
- No idea.
- The shuttle is hailing us.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.481
- Open a channel.
- Channel open.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.990
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Federation Starship Voyager.

02:31.276 --> 02:35.108
- What can we do for you?
- As I stated in my message,

02:35.280 --> 02:39.230
I understand you have a Talaxian
called Neelix aboard.

02:40.577 --> 02:46.865
- I'm Neelix. What do you want?
- It is a matter of utmost urgency.

02:47.420 --> 02:51.371
However, I would prefer
to speak with you privately.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.916
Your life may very well depend upon it.

02:57.940 --> 03:00.961
- Who are you?
- Forgive me.

03:01.139 --> 03:05.137
I am Jetrel. Dr Ma'Bor Jetrel.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.522
Neelix.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:04.179 --> 05:07.133
He's a mass murderer!

05:09.268 --> 05:15.602
When I was much younger, my family
and I lived on a moon called Rinax,

05:15.774 --> 05:20.769
a colony with the most temperate
climate in the Talaxian System.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.733
Warm days, balmy nights.

05:23.907 --> 05:28.818
Until the metreon cascade.
Melodic name, isn't it?

05:28.996 --> 05:32.329
Especially for a weapon
of mass destruction.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.915
And Jetrel was involved
with this weapon?

05:38.463 --> 05:43.422
Dr Jetrel was the scientist
who conceived the metreon cascade,

05:43.594 --> 05:46.927
then he led the team of scientists
who built it.

05:47.970 --> 05:50.548
- I see.
- In the blink of an eye,

05:50.726 --> 05:53.727
Rinax was enveloped by a deadly cloud.

05:53.896 --> 05:57.810
Those lovely days turned into
one endless, frigid night.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.561
More than 300,000 were killed.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.982
But you survived.

06:09.703 --> 06:16.619
I had the good fortune to be on Talax
at the time, with our defence forces,

06:16.793 --> 06:19.878
preparing for an invasion
that never came.

06:20.470 --> 06:22.860
It wasn't necessary.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.900
The day after the cascade
was deployed,

06:25.177 --> 06:29.175
Talax surrendered unconditionally
to the Haakonian Order.

06:32.643 --> 06:35.347
And your family?

06:41.109 --> 06:44.110
I am so sorry.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.737
Dr Jetrel. Lieutenant Tuvok,
my chief of security.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.825
I have heard of
your transporter technology,

06:54.998 --> 06:59.328
but to experience it first-hand
is truly remarkable.

06:59.503 --> 07:03.832
- Mr Neelix has declined to meet you.
- That's not surprising.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.626
I am not a very popular figure
among the Talaxian people.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.555
May we show you to your quarters?

07:13.725 --> 07:17.225
Mr Neelix has allowed me
to speak on his behalf.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.638
You said he may be in danger.

07:19.815 --> 07:23.515
It's imperative that he undergo
a medical examination.

07:23.694 --> 07:28.320
- For what purpose?
- Records show he returned to Rinax

07:28.490 --> 07:31.693
after the cascade
in order to evacuate survivors.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.700
He was exposed to metreon isotopes.

07:35.873 --> 07:42.207
Several rescuers have developed
a blood disease called metremia.

07:42.379 --> 07:46.708
- Is it serious?
- I'm afraid that it's fatal.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.672
The disease attacks
on a molecular level.

07:50.846 --> 07:54.891
It may lay dormant for years,
but once it manifests itself,

07:55.580 --> 07:59.560
it will cause the body's atomic structure
to undergo fission.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.160
The cells will disintegrate.

08:02.191 --> 08:07.267
My equipment can detect the subatomic
signature of the disorder.

08:07.446 --> 08:11.740
Why have you taken it upon yourself
to examine Mr Neelix?

08:11.909 --> 08:16.535
I've evaluated as many members
of the team as possible

08:16.705 --> 08:20.204
in the hope that my research
will lead to a cure.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.958
Please try to persuade
Mr Neelix to see me.

08:24.129 --> 08:28.625
Each Talaxian I screen
brings me one step closer to a cure.

08:42.481 --> 08:45.850
Why didn't you ever tell me
about the war?

08:46.260 --> 08:50.522
Maybe this is one experience
that can't be shared.

08:52.533 --> 08:56.365
It's too... hard

08:56.536 --> 09:01.329
to describe how I feel
to someone who didn't see what I saw.

09:02.584 --> 09:07.330
- I'm sorry.
- You've nothing to be sorry about.

09:09.883 --> 09:14.841
- Excuse me.
- Back from the doctor's already?

09:15.130 --> 09:19.640
I'm afraid I have
some disturbing news, Neelix.

09:19.810 --> 09:24.638
Nothing you tell me could make this day
more disturbing than it's been.

09:30.571 --> 09:36.691
Jetrel says you were exposed to
dangerous levels of metreon poisoning,

09:36.869 --> 09:39.905
and may develop a fatal blood disorder.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.498
He wants to screen you for the disease.

09:51.174 --> 09:54.757
Captain, please tell Dr Jetrel

09:54.928 --> 09:59.721
that I am touched
by his concern for my state of health,

09:59.892 --> 10:05.134
but that I'd rather be immersed in a pit
of eels than be examined by him.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.858
If there's something wrong
we should know.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.620
I don't want that man
within ten parsecs of me.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.938
I understand your feelings,
but this is your life.

10:16.116 --> 10:21.193
Don't either of you find it
the slightest bit strange

10:21.371 --> 10:24.159
that a man who has
made it his life's work

10:24.333 --> 10:28.247
to destroy as many Talaxians
as possible

10:28.420 --> 10:32.632
should suddenly be concerned
with this Talaxians health?

10:32.799 --> 10:35.337
I don't know what his motives are.

10:35.510 --> 10:39.971
Maybe he's trying to undo some
of the damage his weapon caused.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.758
He seems sincere
and I have no reason to doubt him.

10:46.688 --> 10:51.599
If the disease is fatal,
what's the point of knowing if I have it?

10:51.777 --> 10:55.988
Our Doctor is the most skilled physician
we've ever met.

10:56.156 --> 11:01.317
If you have this disease, he won't stop
until he's found a way to treat it.

11:01.495 --> 11:06.204
And if you don't have the disease,
at least you'll have peace of mind.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.913
Peace of mind is a relative thing,
Captain.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.966
Just hear what he has to say.

11:15.133 --> 11:19.380
Then if you still don't want him
to examine you, we won't force you.

11:20.597 --> 11:24.346
Outnumbered and outflanked.

11:24.518 --> 11:28.516
All right, then. I surrender.

11:35.612 --> 11:40.607
The metreon isotopes are unique.
Their rate of decay is highly variable.

11:40.784 --> 11:44.367
It's sometimes years
before metremia sets in.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.705
- And...
- Why are you doing this?

11:47.875 --> 11:54.790
- I beg your pardon?
- Is it all just scientific curiosity,

11:54.256 --> 11:57.506
metreons and isotopes?

11:57.676 --> 12:03.150
Or do you feel guilty
about what you did?

12:04.990 --> 12:06.590
Guilty?

12:06.768 --> 12:10.849
I do not regret it.
I did what had to be done.

12:11.230 --> 12:15.317
Really? It was necessary to vaporise
a quarter of a million people

12:15.485 --> 12:18.570
and leave thousands of others
to be poisoned?

12:18.739 --> 12:25.453
Would it help if I said we never thought
there would be any radiation poisoning,

12:25.621 --> 12:30.283
that anyone close enough to be
exposed would be killed by the blast?

12:30.459 --> 12:35.121
- It was unfortunate we were wrong.
- Unfortunate?

12:36.890 --> 12:39.423
Did you hear that, Captain?
It was "unfortunate".

12:39.593 --> 12:45.596
- I think what Dr Jetrel is saying...
- It's all right. I'm used to it.

12:45.766 --> 12:51.602
I'm simply a scientist.
Yes, I developed the weapon.

12:51.772 --> 12:58.937
But the government and the military
leaders decided to use it, not I.

13:00.489 --> 13:04.736
That must be
a very convenient distinction for you.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.827
Does it help you sleep at night?

13:07.996 --> 13:13.536
I slept no worse last night than
any other night for the past 15 years.

13:13.710 --> 13:19.546
- What does that mean?
- That I must live with my conscience.

13:19.716 --> 13:24.877
As you must live with yours.
How many did you kill during the war?

13:25.550 --> 13:27.261
Gentlemen, please.

13:29.184 --> 13:35.269
This is obviously very difficult,
but we are not here to debate history.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.140
We are here to discuss
Neelix's condition.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.731
Don't worry about it, Captain.

13:40.904 --> 13:45.780
Dr Jetrel will have to find himself
another laboratory rodent.

13:48.787 --> 13:54.623
Because I would rather die than help
you ease your conscience.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.913
I do not expect you to like me,
Mr Neelix,

13:59.890 --> 14:03.466
nor do I hope to allay your obvious pain
with moral arguments.

14:03.635 --> 14:08.178
But I do believe I can help you.
If not you, others of your race.

14:08.348 --> 14:13.141
Isn't that more important
than punishing me?

14:24.239 --> 14:27.489
Are you sure you can't do this?

14:27.659 --> 14:30.779
Your confidence in me is flattering,
Mr Neelix.

14:30.954 --> 14:35.747
But Dr Jetrel's instruments are made
to analyse Talaxian physiology.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.754
Just get it over with.

14:46.345 --> 14:52.500
Did I ever tell you about the notorious
two-tailed talchoks of Rinax?

14:52.226 --> 14:55.130
- I don't think so.
- Nasty little vermin.

14:55.187 --> 14:59.765
Sharp claws. Dripping fangs.
Quite a nuisance.

14:59.942 --> 15:05.102
So one summer, when I was a boy,
I decided to do something about them.

15:05.280 --> 15:11.340
I spent weeks tinkering,
creating a foolproof talchok trap.

15:12.246 --> 15:15.780
Once I perfected it,
I set it in the garden.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.872
The next day I found one of
those beasts, pinned at the neck.

15:20.450 --> 15:27.800
But it wasn't dead. It was squirming
and squealing in agony.

15:27.177 --> 15:32.847
It didn't look so fiendish any more.
It looked like a poor, innocent animal.

15:33.160 --> 15:38.437
- What a horrible story.
- I was so fascinated with my invention

15:38.605 --> 15:41.974
that I never thought about
how that creature would suffer.

15:42.734 --> 15:46.234
- Are you finished?
- For now.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.735
- So am I.
- And?

15:49.908 --> 15:53.526
- I'm sorry, Mr Neelix.
- Why are you sorry?

15:54.997 --> 15:58.745
I'm afraid you have incipient metremia.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.200
Come in.

16:24.109 --> 16:27.858
- How are you feeling?
- Kes, my sweet.

16:29.720 --> 16:34.908
This is not the first time I've stared
into the gaping maw of death.

16:35.780 --> 16:37.866
During the Battle
of the Pyrithian Gorge,

16:38.400 --> 16:42.832
I faced down an entire battery
of Haakonian artillery.

16:43.300 --> 16:48.709
- There I was, with almost no cover...
- You're protecting me again.

16:48.884 --> 16:52.502
I understand your not wanting
to talk about Rinax.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.384
I wasn't there. You're right.

16:55.557 --> 17:00.350
But I'm here now. With you.
We have to face this together.

17:02.814 --> 17:06.180
There's one good thing
that will come from all this.

17:06.984 --> 17:13.237
When I first met you, I didn't know
that your species only lived nine years.

17:14.242 --> 17:19.484
I fell in love with you
without knowing how lonely it would be

17:19.665 --> 17:22.582
to live without you after you're gone.

17:22.751 --> 17:26.665
Now that I'm going to die first,
I don't have to worry about it.

17:27.506 --> 17:31.373
Before I met you,
nine years seemed like an eternity.

17:31.552 --> 17:35.466
It never occurred to me
that anyone could live longer.

17:35.639 --> 17:40.301
Now, no matter how many years we
have left, it doesn't seem like enough.

17:44.640 --> 17:48.311
But the important thing is
to cherish whatever time we have.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.654
Whether it's a day or a decade.

18:04.293 --> 18:09.880
- Come in.
- Am I interrupting?

18:10.882 --> 18:13.753
Please. Sit down.

18:13.927 --> 18:19.301
Captain, I must tell you,
your ship is simply astounding.

18:19.474 --> 18:23.900
- I've been studying your transporters.
- Transporters?

18:23.187 --> 18:25.642
You're not more concerned
with Neelix?

18:25.814 --> 18:31.235
Forgive me,
but that is what I'm here to talk about.

18:31.403 --> 18:34.689
With relatively few minor modifications,

18:34.865 --> 18:39.942
the transporter could be used to
retrieve a sample of the metreon cloud.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.323
- To what end?
- I've always believed

18:43.498 --> 18:47.282
that if I could isolate the isotope
that causes metremia,

18:47.461 --> 18:50.415
it could be used
to synthesise an antibody.

18:53.910 --> 18:56.543
A victim's immune system
could destroy the disease.

18:56.720 --> 19:02.940
Yes, and your transporter system
makes it all possible.

19:02.267 --> 19:06.479
- Can the isotope be transported?
- Yes.

19:07.564 --> 19:10.898
A containment field
would prevent contamination.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.318
Our Doctor could help you
synthesise the antibody.

19:14.488 --> 19:16.527
My thoughts exactly.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.320
- Janeway to bridge.
- Chakotay here.

19:19.493 --> 19:24.451
Tractor Dr Jetrel's vessel in and lay in
a course for the Talaxian System.

19:24.623 --> 19:28.158
- That's a significant detour.
- I'm aware of that.

19:28.335 --> 19:32.878
- But it may mean saving Neelix's life.
- Understood.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.915
I'll request permission from Talax
to transport material.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.803
Lieutenant Torres can help you
with the transporter modifications.

19:43.976 --> 19:48.187
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you, Dr Jetrel.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.356
It's a very promising idea.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.943
What is it?

19:57.114 --> 20:04.279
I think I'm just a little overexcited about
the prospect of discovering a cure.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.788
And all that sparring with Mr Neelix
does take a toll.

20:07.958 --> 20:11.125
- Let the Doctor have a look at you.
- No, I'm fine.

20:11.295 --> 20:14.913
And there's so much to be done.
I want to start right away.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.547
Captain's log, stardate 48832.1.

20:25.726 --> 20:30.637
Neelix is allowing Dr Jetrel
to continue metabolic scans

20:30.814 --> 20:36.570
to facilitate treatment once
the antibody has been synthesised.

20:36.945 --> 20:41.406
- Will you be needing my assistance?
- Not until we have the isotope.

20:41.575 --> 20:44.492
Is there anything more I can do for you?

20:46.163 --> 20:51.406
Very well. Computer, override
command 1-EMH-Alpha. End program.

20:52.878 --> 20:58.881
Incredible.
A hologram that can deactivate itself.

20:59.510 --> 21:03.511
Is there anything besides science
that makes your heart beat faster?

21:03.680 --> 21:06.966
Not anymore.
Now will you please sit down?

21:11.688 --> 21:14.475
You know what I've been thinking?

21:15.776 --> 21:19.608
If I'd been in charge of the cascade,

21:19.780 --> 21:25.533
I'd have... I don't know...
chosen a military target,

21:25.702 --> 21:30.281
simply deployed it
on an uninhabited planet.

21:31.291 --> 21:35.621
Somehow I don't think
I'd have targeted innocent civilians.

21:35.796 --> 21:39.793
The strategists did not think
a demonstration would work.

21:39.967 --> 21:43.585
They wanted to show
the cascade's power in all its horror.

21:43.762 --> 21:47.427
You should have tried to stop them!

21:47.599 --> 21:51.893
Why didn't you speak out?
People would have listened to you.

21:52.620 --> 21:56.309
It would not have made any difference.

21:56.483 --> 22:01.394
If I had not discovered the cascade,
it would have been someone else.

22:01.572 --> 22:07.491
It was inevitable, one discovery
flowing naturally to the next.

22:07.661 --> 22:12.287
Something so enormous as science will
not stop for something as small as man.

22:12.457 --> 22:19.588
- So you did it for science?
- For my planet. And yes, for science.

22:20.549 --> 22:23.633
To know whether or not
it could be done.

22:23.802 --> 22:27.467
It's good to know how the world works.

22:27.639 --> 22:30.261
It is not possible to be a scientist

22:30.434 --> 22:35.345
unless you believe that all the universe's
knowledge and all its power

22:35.522 --> 22:40.101
is of intrinsic value to everyone.

22:40.277 --> 22:45.983
And one must share that knowledge
and allow it to be applied.

22:47.284 --> 22:51.329
And then be willing to live
with the consequences.

22:52.956 --> 22:57.618
Consequences? Who are you
to talk about consequences?

22:58.629 --> 23:02.626
You are not the only one to lose family
during the war.

23:02.799 --> 23:06.927
- Your family was killed?
- Nothing as clean as death.

23:09.970 --> 23:15.520
When I returned home after
the cascade to my lovely wife, Ka'Ree,

23:15.229 --> 23:19.807
she could not bear to look at me.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.937
When I reached out for her,
she'd pull away,

23:23.111 --> 23:26.290
as if I had some contagious disease.

23:26.198 --> 23:31.868
You see, like you, she thought
I had become a monster.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.488
Shortly after that,
she took my three children.

23:36.959 --> 23:39.450
And I have not seen them since.

23:40.337 --> 23:42.709
That's a sad story, Jetrel.

23:44.341 --> 23:46.879
But let me tell you another one.

23:48.530 --> 23:53.723
A man goes back to Rinax
after the cascade.

23:53.892 --> 23:56.727
Back to what had been his home.

23:56.895 --> 23:59.849
To look for survivors.

24:00.230 --> 24:05.563
But the impact of the blast has set off
fires and there's nothing there.

24:05.737 --> 24:11.408
Just smouldering ruins.
The stench of seared flesh.

24:12.536 --> 24:15.572
But in the distance,
in the middle of the emptiness,

24:15.747 --> 24:20.990
from out of this huge
cloud of billowing dust,

24:23.589 --> 24:27.337
he can see bodies moving.

24:28.552 --> 24:32.965
Whimpering. Coming toward him.

24:34.975 --> 24:40.978
They're monsters,
their flesh horribly charred,

24:41.148 --> 24:43.721
the colour of shale.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.687
One of them comes toward him...

24:51.825 --> 24:54.577
mangled arms outstretched...

24:55.996 --> 25:00.872
and he can't help it,
he turns away, frightened.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.450
But then the thing speaks.

25:06.465 --> 25:12.880
He knows by the sound of her voice
that she's not a monster, but a child.

25:13.263 --> 25:15.303
A little girl.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.473
Mr Neelix, I...

25:22.397 --> 25:26.312
Her name was Palaxia.

25:28.737 --> 25:32.735
We brought her back to Talax
with the other survivors.

25:32.908 --> 25:36.193
Over the next few weeks
I stayed at her bedside,

25:36.370 --> 25:39.240
and watched her wither away.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.660
Those are consequences, Dr Jetrel.

25:51.218 --> 25:57.700
There is no way I can ever
apologise to you, Mr Neelix.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.884
That's why I have not tried.

26:03.564 --> 26:07.312
Did you ever think that
maybe your wife was right?

26:07.484 --> 26:10.105
That you had become a monster?

26:11.280 --> 26:13.319
Yes.

26:14.616 --> 26:20.730
The day we tested the cascade,
when I saw that blinding light,

26:20.247 --> 26:23.201
brighter than 1,000 suns,

26:24.418 --> 26:29.708
I knew at that moment
exactly what I had become.

26:30.757 --> 26:33.758
I hope you have to live with that
a very long time.

26:33.927 --> 26:38.139
I'm afraid you will not get your wish,
Mr Neelix.

26:39.224 --> 26:41.549
And why is that?

26:43.353 --> 26:47.565
I have advanced metremia.
I'll be dead in a matter of days.

26:56.533 --> 27:00.234
- It's your turn.
- There's no open shot.

27:00.412 --> 27:04.161
Why don't you call a safety?
Isn't that what you always do?

27:05.751 --> 27:07.957
- I'm no coward.
- Really?

27:08.128 --> 27:10.370
Wait! It's my turn!

27:10.214 --> 27:13.250
You lost your chance to play,
now you're going to lose.

27:13.425 --> 27:17.636
Neelix, where did you go?
Why did you leave us?

27:17.804 --> 27:21.553
- I did what I thought was right.
- You were afraid.

27:21.725 --> 27:23.468
No! I...

27:23.644 --> 27:25.766
- Neelix.
- Who are you?

27:25.938 --> 27:28.310
It's me. Palaxia.

27:29.566 --> 27:32.603
Why weren't you there to help us?

27:37.574 --> 27:41.275
You! You did this! Butcher!

27:45.958 --> 27:48.246
Bridge to Neelix.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.840
Here, Captain.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.587
I thought you'd like
to know, we're approaching Rinax.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.560
Neelix?

28:06.520 --> 28:09.437
Thank you, Captain. I'll be right there.

28:11.108 --> 28:13.813
Entering synchronous orbit, Captain.

28:24.913 --> 28:27.784
Hard to believe that on clear nights

28:27.958 --> 28:32.834
you could look up from Talax and see
the shimmering lights of the colony.

28:35.841 --> 28:42.900
The night of the cascade,
a bright flash cut across the sky,

28:42.181 --> 28:46.641
so blinding that people
threw themselves to the ground.

28:48.687 --> 28:52.305
And everything stopped.
Like a moment out of time.

28:54.610 --> 28:58.738
We all looked up to see
where the flash had come from.

28:59.948 --> 29:03.697
But the sky seemed oddly empty.

29:06.413 --> 29:11.750
Took most of us a few seconds to
realise it was because Rinax was...

29:13.170 --> 29:14.961
gone.

29:15.130 --> 29:20.290
The moon was there. We just couldn't
see it because of that metreon cloud.

29:20.469 --> 29:22.545
Engineering to bridge.

29:22.721 --> 29:25.971
We're ready to begin
transporter presequencing.

29:26.141 --> 29:31.515
This brings back too many memories,
Captain. If you'll excuse me.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.236
Of course.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.489
I believe I asked for a larger container.

29:50.666 --> 29:54.820
We're talking about
a cloud sample large enough

29:54.253 --> 29:57.170
to contain a few
sub-atomic particles, right?

29:57.339 --> 30:01.965
Yes, but the isotope accounts for just
a minuscule fraction of the cloud.

30:02.135 --> 30:06.429
- I want to be sure we get enough.
- We do this all the time.

30:06.598 --> 30:10.980
Captain, I'm ready to begin transport.

30:10.269 --> 30:13.353
- Proceed.
- Targeting scanners.

30:13.522 --> 30:16.950
Locking on.

30:17.250 --> 30:19.267
Energise.

30:24.241 --> 30:28.404
We have the sample aboard.
The containment field is holding.

30:28.579 --> 30:31.449
Well done. Janeway out.

30:31.623 --> 30:33.663
Good luck, Doctor.

30:47.222 --> 30:49.262
Neelix?

30:50.642 --> 30:53.500
Are you in here?

31:04.310 --> 31:08.776
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Why did you take your combadge off?

31:10.412 --> 31:14.540
- I wanted to be alone.
- I'm sorry to bother you.

31:15.667 --> 31:21.207
But I was worried.
I know how you must feel.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.623
No, you don't know!

31:25.177 --> 31:28.470
Not everything.

31:29.139 --> 31:33.931
You don't know where I was
the night Rinax was destroyed.

31:34.102 --> 31:38.266
On Talax, fighting
with the defence forces.

31:38.440 --> 31:43.351
I was on Talax. But I wasn't
fighting with the defence forces.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.650
I was hiding from them.

31:53.580 --> 31:57.329
I wasn't a hero at
the Battle of the Pyrithian Gorge.

32:00.546 --> 32:06.335
- I've never even been there.
- I don't understand.

32:07.511 --> 32:11.555
- I never reported for duty.
- Why not?

32:13.392 --> 32:17.224
I thought the war was unjust.

32:17.396 --> 32:22.224
That Talax was fighting for reasons
that weren't worth killing for.

32:24.444 --> 32:28.270
Or at least that's what I told myself.

32:29.950 --> 32:33.698
But the real reason I didn't report...

32:38.542 --> 32:41.800
...was because I was a coward.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.331
Now you know.

32:51.221 --> 32:55.349
If the authorities had caught you,
what would they have done?

32:55.517 --> 33:01.271
During wartime, punishment
for refusing military service was death.

33:01.440 --> 33:07.644
So you put your life at risk
for something you believed in.

33:07.821 --> 33:11.570
And you think that makes you
a coward? I don't understand.

33:11.742 --> 33:14.197
It makes me a liar.

33:14.369 --> 33:18.340
I've lied about it all these years.
To everyone.

33:18.832 --> 33:24.171
- Because you're dishonest?
- Because I'm ashamed.

33:25.130 --> 33:28.629
What an awful burden
you've carried all these years.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.419
- No wonder you're so angry with Jetrel.
- Course I am!

33:32.596 --> 33:37.637
He killed them all. My mother,
my father, my little brothers.

33:38.810 --> 33:45.180
Is that really why? Ever since Jetrel
came on board you've despised him.

33:45.359 --> 33:50.186
The hurt and anger you've held in
all these years was vented at him.

33:50.864 --> 33:53.984
But was it really Jetrel
you're angry with?

33:54.159 --> 33:56.911
Is he the one you blame
for what happened?

33:58.800 --> 34:02.825
- I don't know.
- Or was he just a convenient target

34:03.100 --> 34:05.919
to keep you from looking
somewhere else?

34:06.880 --> 34:08.875
You mean...

34:10.384 --> 34:13.170
from looking at myself?

34:18.159 --> 34:20.342
You may be right.

34:22.563 --> 34:27.389
But I hate him.
I don't think I can stop hating him.

34:28.235 --> 34:31.521
Maybe you have to stop
hating yourself first.

34:47.963 --> 34:50.389
Are we ready to begin synthesis?

34:50.215 --> 34:55.458
Computer, override command
1-EMH-Alpha and end program.

34:55.637 --> 34:57.428
Just wait...

35:31.381 --> 35:33.421
- Dr Jetrel.
- You startled me!

35:33.592 --> 35:38.337
- I'm sorry but I need to speak...
- Could we talk later?

35:38.513 --> 35:41.633
It won't be long before
I am too weak to work.

35:41.809 --> 35:44.300
I would like to finish before I die.

35:48.565 --> 35:50.854
What is that?

35:52.194 --> 35:56.406
You're engaging in some
bizarre experiment, aren't you?

35:56.573 --> 36:00.191
- What is it this time?
- I can help them.

36:02.704 --> 36:06.156
What do you call that?
Scientific progress?

36:06.333 --> 36:09.120
I'm going to the Captain.

36:17.677 --> 36:20.595
- Any progress report from Dr Jetrel?
- Not yet.

36:20.764 --> 36:24.180
Bridge to sickbay. Janeway to sickbay.

36:26.103 --> 36:28.261
Janeway to Dr Jetrel.

36:29.773 --> 36:32.608
Computer, activate
Emergency Medical Hologram.

36:32.776 --> 36:35.101
What's going on down there, Doctor?

36:35.279 --> 36:39.110
Dr Jetrel deactivated me.
He's gone now.

36:39.282 --> 36:41.987
Computer, locate Dr Jetrel.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.236
Dr Jetrel is in transporter room 1.

36:44.413 --> 36:49.751
And Mr Neelix is unconscious.
It appears he's been tranquillised.

36:50.919 --> 36:55.546
You have the bridge.
Security to transporter room 1. Tuvok.

37:02.890 --> 37:07.717
- Step aside, Doctor.
- I must continue. Lives depend on it.

37:07.894 --> 37:11.513
You're beginning to lose credibility.

37:11.690 --> 37:14.810
Captain, I beg you.
Let me bring them back.

37:14.985 --> 37:18.188
Bring who back? Who, Doctor?

37:19.531 --> 37:21.987
Who is it you're going to bring back?

37:23.160 --> 37:25.402
The victims of Rinax.

37:34.588 --> 37:41.171
- He's out of his mind, Captain.
- Please. Look at my calculations.

37:41.344 --> 37:44.381
You remember what I told you
about metremia.

37:44.556 --> 37:49.895
How it causes the body's atomic
structure to undergo fission.

37:50.620 --> 37:55.981
It mirrors the way the metreon cascade
vaporised its victims

37:56.151 --> 37:58.357
through biomolecular disintegration.

37:58.528 --> 38:04.401
- Do we have to listen to this?
- I think we should hear him out.

38:04.576 --> 38:07.613
What I've been working on
for the past 15 years

38:07.788 --> 38:13.826
is a way to rebuild that atomic structure.
What I call regenerative fusion.

38:14.200 --> 38:19.209
Are you saying
you're actually trying to restore

38:19.383 --> 38:22.668
people who were vaporised
by the metreon cascade?

38:22.844 --> 38:30.920
- Yes!
- I don't see how that's possible.

38:30.269 --> 38:34.978
The properties of the cloud are such
that the disassembled bio-matter

38:35.148 --> 38:42.112
has been held in a state of animated
suspension. Reintegration is possible.

38:42.281 --> 38:45.484
Is that what you were doing
with that thing in sickbay?

38:45.659 --> 38:48.613
Yes. Exactly. Neelix saw it.

38:48.787 --> 38:52.536
It was an amalgamation
of randomly fused organic material,

38:52.708 --> 38:55.792
bits and pieces
of previously vaporised bio-matter.

38:57.462 --> 39:03.490
But if the bio-matter in the cloud
is so random, so jumbled,

39:03.218 --> 39:05.543
how could you reconstruct
something whole?

39:05.720 --> 39:11.724
I identified the genetic coding
of a specific victim. A test case.

39:11.894 --> 39:15.179
Once we input his DNA sequence,

39:15.355 --> 39:21.310
then we can isolate his atomic
fragments with targeting scanners

39:21.486 --> 39:24.690
and then rematerialise him.

39:26.283 --> 39:28.441
What if he's right?

39:28.619 --> 39:34.289
Dr Jetrel's proposing the reconstruction
of a complex set of bio-systems

39:34.458 --> 39:36.783
from billions of subatomic particles.

39:38.628 --> 39:43.753
I'm afraid I have to agree.
It all sounds very implausible.

39:46.428 --> 39:50.930
You sound exactly like my country.

39:52.309 --> 39:58.561
I asked them for more funds to continue
my research to help Rinax victims

39:58.732 --> 40:04.188
because I wanted the world to know
I'm not a monster.

40:04.363 --> 40:09.488
My theories can be used to heal
as well as to destroy.

40:11.119 --> 40:14.571
But they refused me,

40:14.748 --> 40:18.247
called me a Talaxian sympathiser,
and exiled me.

40:22.756 --> 40:26.125
Does Neelix really have metremia?

40:26.301 --> 40:31.296
Or was that just a pretext
for getting us to come to Rinax?

40:31.473 --> 40:34.308
It was just a pretext, Captain.

40:35.310 --> 40:38.845
You do not have metremia.
You are not going to die.

40:44.653 --> 40:47.322
Why didn't you just tell us the truth?

40:47.489 --> 40:51.819
Your Captain is an accomplished
scientist. She doubts my theories.

40:51.994 --> 40:58.320
My government did, too. I just could not
risk being not believed again.

40:58.208 --> 41:04.578
But, Captain... it will work.

41:06.800 --> 41:12.544
Captain, if there's any chance
he can do it, you've got to let him try.

41:13.515 --> 41:16.884
Neelix, there are just
too many variables.

41:17.610 --> 41:19.847
Please, Captain.

41:27.112 --> 41:32.154
Activate the emergency containment
field around the transporter pad.

41:32.367 --> 41:35.119
Aye, Captain.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.165
Emergency containment field activated.

41:40.333 --> 41:43.584
Retarget scanners to a wide
confinement beam.

41:43.754 --> 41:47.870
It's our only hope
of achieving bond cohesion.

41:47.257 --> 41:50.460
- Retargeting scanners to wide beam.
- Energise.

41:53.346 --> 41:56.217
Phase transition coils to maximum.

41:59.978 --> 42:03.394
- Is the biogenic field operational?
- Affirmative.

42:04.399 --> 42:06.558
It's incredible!

42:06.735 --> 42:09.600
Atomic cohesion has dropped to 49%.

42:09.237 --> 42:12.239
- Buffers to maximum power.
- They are at 100%.

42:12.407 --> 42:16.488
- Take them to 120%.
- Pattern buffers to 120%.

42:16.662 --> 42:19.947
- We're losing him.
- Atomic cohesion to 39%.

42:20.124 --> 42:22.412
22%. 14%.

42:22.584 --> 42:27.827
- His pattern is degrading.
- Increase the power to the buffers!

42:28.600 --> 42:31.292
Is there any way to augment
the biogenic field?

42:31.468 --> 42:34.671
The degree of fragmentation
is too great.

42:34.846 --> 42:37.219
We are overloading the system.

42:43.210 --> 42:46.271
Shut it down, Mr Tuvok.

43:02.400 --> 43:06.121
Captain's log, stardate 48840.5.

43:06.295 --> 43:09.829
Dr Jetrel's metremia
is now in its final stage.

43:10.700 --> 43:13.800
He's spending his remaining hours
in sickbay.

43:30.152 --> 43:32.260
Neelix!

43:34.310 --> 43:40.235
I suppose you think
this is a fitting punishment for me.

43:43.400 --> 43:47.417
Maybe the cascade
was a punishment for all of us.

43:47.586 --> 43:50.919
For our hatred.

43:51.890 --> 43:53.794
Our brutality.

43:55.427 --> 43:58.214
There's something I need to tell you.

44:00.390 --> 44:04.554
I tried to tell you before, but...

44:04.728 --> 44:06.935
What is it?

44:07.105 --> 44:10.309
I want to tell you...

44:11.777 --> 44:14.650
that I forgive you.
