00:02.383 --> 00:03.882
- Yes?
- I'm Emma's mother.

00:04.422 --> 00:05.373
She came here, but now Emma

00:05.398 --> 00:06.583
hasn't heard from her since,

00:06.608 --> 00:07.968
and her phone's been disconnected.

- Yes?
- DEA.

00:13.742 --> 00:15.828
I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards,

00:15.875 --> 00:17.751
but don't you think that it's possible

00:17.752 --> 00:19.551
that I might make even more progress

00:19.715 --> 00:21.924
if I'm near the person
who makes me feel complete?

00:21.949 --> 00:24.131
We're going to start with
three sessions a week.

00:24.156 --> 00:25.490
I'll sign your release.

00:25.515 --> 00:27.092
<i>Certain things can never change,</i>

00:27.117 --> 00:30.251
but I will always remember that
you helped my mother at a time

00:30.252 --> 00:31.921
that she was so confused.

00:31.922 --> 00:35.621
I love him, and you
have to deal with it!

00:35.622 --> 00:37.621
Don't you think she deserves
to have a man in her life?

00:37.622 --> 00:40.292
[groans] Agh! I hate you!

01:24.783 --> 01:26.047
You made coffee... I was on my way

01:26.072 --> 01:27.133
- to do that for you right now.
- Yeah.

01:27.158 --> 01:28.881
Yeah. Made a pot a while ago.

01:29.105 --> 01:30.985
It should still be
good, if you want one.

01:32.024 --> 01:33.922
- You sleep okay?
- Mm-mm. Not much.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.722
Alex, that was the hardest part.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.565
Things will be better now.

01:44.728 --> 01:45.461
How so?

01:45.634 --> 01:46.846
Because that was the first time

01:46.871 --> 01:48.671
the three of us were under
the same roof together.

01:48.672 --> 01:50.687
It was bound to be hard for Norman.

01:50.932 --> 01:52.581
Okay? But we're through
it. We're through it.

01:52.582 --> 01:53.621
We ripped off the Band-Aid.

01:53.622 --> 01:54.686
It's gonna be better now.

01:54.711 --> 01:56.339
But having him here is not the solution.

01:56.364 --> 01:58.251
He should be back at Pineview.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.637
He's going back to Pineview.

01:59.662 --> 02:00.758
I'm gonna take him to therapy today.

02:00.783 --> 02:02.300
That's not the same, and you know that.

02:02.325 --> 02:03.688
I don't know that. I'm not a doctor,

02:03.713 --> 02:05.462
and neither are you, so
you don't know that either.

02:05.487 --> 02:06.786
I'm... I'm never gonna
be that guy who just

02:06.811 --> 02:07.888
tells you what you want to hear, okay?

02:07.913 --> 02:10.042
And I don't want you to be that guy.

02:13.672 --> 02:15.381
I don't feel safe leaving
you alone with him.

02:15.382 --> 02:16.581
- That's ridiculous.
- I don't think it is.

02:16.582 --> 02:18.621
No. That is so ridiculous.

02:18.622 --> 02:20.057
You are overreacting.

02:20.277 --> 02:21.501
What if I'm not?

02:24.082 --> 02:26.211
It's just... no one
knows Norman like I do.

02:26.212 --> 02:28.961
We... we are two parts
of the same person.

02:28.962 --> 02:31.581
There's no possible way he could ever,

02:31.582 --> 02:33.881
ever in any way hurt me, ever.

02:34.298 --> 02:36.501
He... you're just so wrong.

a shower or anything?

No, I'll do it at home, okay?

03:08.951 --> 03:10.067
Can we talk later?

03:10.382 --> 03:11.751
Okay.

- Norma, I'll see you later.
- Okay. Yeah.

03:46.332 --> 03:47.691
Oh, it's fine.

03:48.340 --> 03:49.458
You should go upstairs and get dressed

03:49.483 --> 03:50.581
or we'll be late for therapy.

03:50.582 --> 03:52.559
Okay, honey. Okay.

I'll go get ready.

04:36.780 --> 04:38.751
Do you want to put up the
Christmas lights later?

04:38.752 --> 04:40.921
I waited for you to do that.

04:41.264 --> 04:43.244
I know you have very strong feelings

04:43.269 --> 04:44.519
about Christmas lights.

04:46.849 --> 04:47.881
Okay. Yes.

04:47.906 --> 04:49.656
Then, uh, sure, we can do that.

04:51.693 --> 04:53.773
Maybe we could ask Alex to help.

04:57.676 --> 04:59.216
You're joking.

05:00.436 --> 05:01.677
[sighs] Okay.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.945
I know last night did not go well,

05:03.946 --> 05:05.826
but we can't get caught up in that.

05:07.585 --> 05:09.026
And I believe in you. I believe in Alex,

05:09.051 --> 05:10.250
and I know this can work.

05:10.605 --> 05:11.880
It's...

05:11.881 --> 05:14.340
I mean, it's gonna feel
shitty for a little while,

05:14.341 --> 05:16.052
but we can get through it, right?

05:16.077 --> 05:17.407
We can live through it.

05:19.647 --> 05:21.268
You know, just think of Alex as someone

05:21.293 --> 05:24.293
you could share the burden
of your crazy mother.

05:31.717 --> 05:33.396
My mother, she barely knows this man,

05:33.421 --> 05:35.001
and then she just ups and marries him.

05:36.678 --> 05:37.857
That's so like her.

05:40.324 --> 05:43.457
Oh, and I found out that she
married him for the insurance...

05:44.355 --> 05:46.312
to pay for all of
this. Did you know that?

05:46.337 --> 05:48.297
That he was paying?

05:49.723 --> 05:51.340
No, I didn't know that.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.407
Hm, well, it is not
exactly normal, is it,

05:54.432 --> 05:56.251
to marry someone for their insurance?

05:58.393 --> 06:00.816
Well, perhaps she felt like
she had no other choice.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.130
Uh, no.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.171
No, I don't think that is it.

06:05.540 --> 06:07.250
What is it, then?

06:07.251 --> 06:09.790
That the marriage is, uh... is real!

06:09.791 --> 06:12.210
"Oh, hello, here's your new dad.

06:12.312 --> 06:13.352
"Oh, look at the sheriff.

06:13.377 --> 06:16.056
Here we all are together,
one big, happy family."

06:18.241 --> 06:19.724
Would that be so bad?

06:19.749 --> 06:21.741
Yes, it would, because it is not real.

06:22.047 --> 06:23.927
It is all about her fear of being alone.

06:25.758 --> 06:29.183
And so when I went
away and she was alone,

06:29.208 --> 06:31.091
the Sheriff... whoo, old Alex,

06:31.116 --> 06:33.066
he had no problem stepping in.

06:33.492 --> 06:34.821
I've always had this feeling

06:34.846 --> 06:36.302
that he's hated me, and now I know why.

06:36.327 --> 06:37.386
He wanted to be with her.

06:37.411 --> 06:40.346
Oh, he couldn't wait for
me to be locked up in here

06:40.371 --> 06:42.473
and pay for it so he
could just get to her.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.556
Oh, let me tell you, though.
He has got a big surprise

06:45.581 --> 06:48.487
coming when he realizes
just how difficult she can be

06:48.512 --> 06:51.262
and how damaged she really is!

06:53.344 --> 06:56.343
<i>[tense music]</i>

07:12.294 --> 07:13.616
Everyone sees this part of her

07:13.641 --> 07:17.231
that is normal and friendly and happy.

07:18.428 --> 07:20.217
But I see what is really there.

07:22.912 --> 07:27.040
That she is as frightened and tiny

07:27.065 --> 07:28.906
and fragile inside as a baby bird...

07:30.890 --> 07:32.269
And that she's lived
her whole life that way

07:32.294 --> 07:34.626
because she can just be
crushed by disappointment.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.989
Oh, but she doesn't let
anyone else see that but me.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.149
He's got no idea what
he's got coming for him.

07:48.070 --> 07:49.261
What'll happen next is

07:49.286 --> 07:50.926
that he won't measure
up to her standards.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.439
She'll start to pass judgment on him.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.399
Not like this or that.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.584
She'll criticize him.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.068
And after a while, he'll leave.

08:01.951 --> 08:03.279
He'll run away. He'll be gone.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.069
Her heart will be
broken, and then it'll be

08:38.380 --> 08:40.958
It's gonna be fine. I promise.

08:42.073 --> 08:45.309
Yeah... the important goal
here is to get him better,

08:45.310 --> 08:49.038
and having him home right now,
it might seem right short-term,

what he thinks is best.

You're not giving him a
chance, and it hurts me.

room for him or something.

I borrowed it, and she
left this in the pocket.

11:08.723 --> 11:10.035
depending on the terms, of course,

11:10.060 --> 11:12.189
but let's clarify our deal first.

11:12.277 --> 11:13.769
We'll give you Bob Paris's murderer

11:13.770 --> 11:16.245
in exchange for no jail
time, probation only.

11:16.548 --> 11:18.559
Not if she's an accessory.

11:18.673 --> 11:19.769

11:20.246 --> 11:21.575
- She's not.
- Yeah.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.325
But she knows who did it.

11:23.989 --> 11:25.594
What if my client were able to prove

11:25.619 --> 11:27.869
that the murderer was
Sheriff Alex Romero?

11:29.619 --> 11:30.989
You can give us Romero?

11:34.561 --> 11:36.980
- Yeah.
- How?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.439
My client is willing to wear a wire.

11:40.682 --> 11:42.092
And why would he confess to her?

11:47.159 --> 11:48.696
Because we've had a long-standing

11:48.721 --> 11:50.471
romantic relationship.

What's up?

12:17.613 --> 12:18.943
Um...

12:22.257 --> 12:25.357
I don't think, uh... I
don't think Norman should be

12:25.382 --> 12:27.512
out of the mental institution.

12:31.645 --> 12:34.568
I think he might...
I think he's dangerous.

And honestly, I'm... I'm afraid
to leave Norma alone with him.

12:41.784 --> 12:43.364
Okay, now, I'm... I'm only curious,

12:43.389 --> 12:47.100
but have you ever seen him
exhibit violent behavior?

12:53.770 --> 12:55.574
[sighs]

12:56.752 --> 12:58.449
Yes. Yeah, I have.

13:01.762 --> 13:03.418
I don't think he should be home either.

13:05.106 --> 13:07.610
Okay. Well, Norma can't, uh...

13:07.635 --> 13:09.099
she won't see it.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.543
You're, uh... you're
preaching to the choir.

13:12.770 --> 13:13.894
And I don't want to do this,

13:13.919 --> 13:17.144
but it might come down to us
having to have him committed.

You mean behind Norma's back?

13:22.203 --> 13:23.898
Well, she's never gonna do it herself.

13:25.351 --> 13:26.769
Now, I can start legal proceedings

13:26.770 --> 13:28.439
to have him formally committed

13:28.635 --> 13:30.675
if I get the signatures
of two family members.

13:33.184 --> 13:34.524

Well, I'm afraid something more's

13:39.441 --> 13:41.021
gonna happen if we don't, Dylan.

13:45.613 --> 13:48.729

14:36.836 --> 14:38.506
He's down at the motel.

What's wrong?

14:42.908 --> 14:44.321
I, um...

14:46.102 --> 14:47.552

Yeah, I was missing it. What?

14:59.769 --> 15:01.308
This isn't your earring, Norma.

15:05.468 --> 15:06.330
This is Emma's mother's.

15:06.355 --> 15:08.103
She was wearing it in the hospital.

15:09.478 --> 15:10.864
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

15:10.889 --> 15:12.269
I would never wear that.

15:14.278 --> 15:16.605
- Can I have it?
- No, you can't.

15:20.033 --> 15:22.611
I don't know what
your problem is, Dylan.

15:22.636 --> 15:25.218
- Why did you have it, Norma?
- I just found it outside.

15:25.243 --> 15:26.623
I must have put it in my pocket.

15:29.312 --> 15:30.985
Then why were you
pretending like it was yours?

15:31.010 --> 15:32.296
It didn't seem worth explaining.

15:32.321 --> 15:34.401
Why are you making such
a big deal out of it?

15:39.326 --> 15:40.536
You need to listen to me, Norma.

15:40.561 --> 15:42.135
You're just talking a bunch of nonsense.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.199
I don't need to hear it.
I have enough going on.

15:45.116 --> 15:46.324
It's just a stupid earring.

15:46.325 --> 15:47.665
It doesn't mean anything.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.073
Then why were you keeping it?

15:51.775 --> 15:52.681
Stop hiding, Norma!

15:52.706 --> 15:54.335
I'm not hiding! What is wrong with you?

15:54.360 --> 15:55.661
Why did you have that
earring in your pocket?

15:55.686 --> 15:57.555
- I told you why!
- Stop lying to me!

15:57.580 --> 15:58.674
What do you want from me, Dylan?

15:58.699 --> 16:00.058
I want you to face the truth that's...

16:00.125 --> 16:01.411
It's right in front of us!

16:01.436 --> 16:03.356
- Norman is sick!
- He's seeing a doctor!

16:03.381 --> 16:04.670
- He's seeing a doctor...
- No! He shouldn't be...

16:04.694 --> 16:05.744
- three times a week!
- out of the institution!

16:05.745 --> 16:06.488
He's dangerous!

16:06.513 --> 16:08.117
- You don't know that!
- I know enough!

16:08.142 --> 16:09.824
Why do you keep doing this?

16:09.849 --> 16:11.909
Because I'm afraid of
what's gonna happen,

16:11.934 --> 16:12.840
of what's already happened.

16:12.865 --> 16:14.864
Stop being dramatic!

16:15.020 --> 16:16.849
You're just inventing all of this.

16:16.874 --> 16:19.159
You're making shit up

Norman should be committed.

16:38.735 --> 16:40.926
Dylan, wait. Wait!

16:41.285 --> 16:44.454
How do you know how he
feels? How do you know that?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.244
Because he told me.

16:46.245 --> 16:48.646
Okay? We talked. He...
he's worried just like I am.

16:49.021 --> 16:50.466
He thinks that when it comes to Norman,

16:50.491 --> 16:51.560
you can't see clearly.

16:52.116 --> 16:53.139
What?

16:53.193 --> 16:56.075

the... and you're trying so hard

see what's right around you!

16:58.893 --> 17:01.244
So the two of you are getting
together behind my back?

17:03.159 --> 17:04.584
Why? What's he gonna do about it?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.034
What... what... does
he want to commit Norman

17:09.059 --> 17:10.175
without telling me?

17:10.201 --> 17:11.769
- You should ask him.
- Dylan, tell me.

quite understood that part,

you two were friends

frame it in your head,

32:48.657 --> 32:51.145
I don't know. In some ways it has.

32:51.146 --> 32:53.526
Well, why are we both
broken right now, Mother?

32:56.436 --> 32:58.485
Life is hard,

32:58.486 --> 33:02.605
but we still have each other,

33:02.606 --> 33:05.525
and we will always have each other,

33:05.526 --> 33:07.485
and nothing will ever change that,

33:07.486 --> 33:08.856
and that's everything.

33:18.301 --> 33:21.685
Do you remember when
you said you wanted to go

33:21.686 --> 33:23.356
and move to Oahu?

33:25.030 --> 33:29.533
That it was safer
because it was an island?

33:29.558 --> 33:32.275
[laughs] I do.

33:32.276 --> 33:33.899
I remember.

33:33.924 --> 33:35.435
Then why don't we go there?

33:35.436 --> 33:37.225
[laughs]

33:37.250 --> 33:40.443
- Because we have no money.
- Well, so we save up.

33:40.468 --> 33:41.935
We sell what we can sell.

33:41.936 --> 33:45.185
The furniture in this place
must be worth something.

33:45.186 --> 33:47.277
We just walk away from the house.

33:47.302 --> 33:48.895
We let the bank have it.

33:48.982 --> 33:50.912
We buy two tickets to Oahu.

33:51.451 --> 33:53.016
We get jobs there.

33:53.486 --> 33:55.145
We get a little apartment

33:55.146 --> 33:58.105
and walk on down to the beach every day

33:58.319 --> 33:59.605
and live on macadamia nuts.

33:59.606 --> 34:00.815
[laughs]

34:00.816 --> 34:04.493
[both laughing]

34:04.518 --> 34:07.302
You always loved new beginnings, Mother.

34:07.327 --> 34:09.282
Fresh starts.

34:09.962 --> 34:12.868
I don't think I can start over, Norman.

34:12.893 --> 34:14.650
I think you can, Mother.

34:15.626 --> 34:16.895
You will.

34:17.525 --> 34:19.121
We'll just do it together.

34:19.800 --> 34:23.516
- Are you
serious? - Mm-hmm.

34:23.542 --> 34:25.868
- You really want to do it?
- Yeah.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.118
Yeah. I do. I really do.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.190
Yeah, it sounds crazy,

34:34.216 --> 34:36.846
but... but nice.

34:44.893 --> 34:46.541
Look at us, Mother.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.570
We are very charming people.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.145
[both laughing]

34:52.583 --> 34:54.960
The hospitality business on the islands

34:54.985 --> 34:56.105
will just swoop us up.

34:56.106 --> 34:58.395
[laughs]

34:58.694 --> 35:00.028
I just think we can do anything

35:00.053 --> 35:01.704
as long as we're together.

35:03.504 --> 35:05.624
We're supposed to be
together, aren't we, Norman?

35:06.785 --> 35:07.785
Are we?

35:08.448 --> 35:09.778
Yeah.

35:10.948 --> 35:14.108
Yes, we are, Mother. Forever.
