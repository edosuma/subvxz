WEBVTT

00:00.065 --> 00:02.229
I want to know what's going on
with the huge woman,

00:02.264 --> 00:03.731
and I want to know
what the deal is

00:03.766 --> 00:05.066
- with the red witch lady.
- Yes.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.267
Yes.
Yes.

00:06.301 --> 00:07.569
(laughs)
I would too.

00:07.603 --> 00:09.103
- You know what I'm saying?
- (laughing)

00:09.137 --> 00:10.471
Straight out.

00:10.505 --> 00:12.006
No, but I mean, like,
have you?

00:12.041 --> 00:14.479
Have you-- have you ever
slept with a black guy?

00:14.497 --> 00:17.044
No, but I really want to.

00:17.079 --> 00:18.712
- (laughs)
- Me too!

00:18.746 --> 00:20.981
Apparently, it is, like,

00:21.015 --> 00:24.085
a whole other thing
than sleeping with white men.

00:24.119 --> 00:25.219
Oh, no, no.

00:25.253 --> 00:26.387
I heard they're
supposed to be, like,

00:26.421 --> 00:28.155
way better at it
or something.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.958
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard that too.

00:30.992 --> 00:32.460
I wonder if it's
'cause they have,

00:32.494 --> 00:34.761
like-- like, better rhythm,
you know?

00:34.796 --> 00:36.730
Right, 'cause
they're really good dancers.

00:36.764 --> 00:41.902
I mean, apparently,
they have, like, bigger--

00:41.936 --> 00:44.304
Oh, way bigger penises, right?
(laughs)

00:44.338 --> 00:45.438
Yeah.

00:45.473 --> 00:47.140
I guess that's
because of Africa?

00:47.174 --> 00:49.442
Yeah, like,
I feel like they're just--

00:49.477 --> 00:51.211
they're, like, really
with you in the moment.

00:51.245 --> 00:52.312
Hmm.

00:52.346 --> 00:53.513
Like, if they're gonna
be with you,

00:53.547 --> 00:54.747
they're in the here and now.

00:54.781 --> 00:57.016
Exactly. Exactly.

00:57.050 --> 01:00.220
Because they know that
they basically have no future.

01:00.254 --> 01:01.421
(laughs)
I know.

01:01.455 --> 01:02.589
- Think about it.
- It's so sad.

01:02.623 --> 01:05.291
Think about it!
(laughs)

01:05.325 --> 01:07.426
I do feel like they treat
their women with just, like,

01:07.460 --> 01:10.129
a little bit
more compassion, though.

01:10.163 --> 01:11.597
Yeah,
like, respect and stuff.

01:11.632 --> 01:15.367
Oh, because their dads
were never around!

01:15.401 --> 01:19.438
Oh, right, and they also have
a lot of time on their hands

01:19.472 --> 01:22.108
'cause even if they have kids,
they never go visit them.

01:22.142 --> 01:24.443
Oh, please. Totally.
Baby daddy?

01:24.477 --> 01:25.810
- That's a thing.
- Oh.

01:25.845 --> 01:28.747
That's in the dictionary now
because of black people.

01:28.781 --> 01:31.517
See?
Ser-i-ou-sly.

01:31.551 --> 01:36.188
Apparently, black guys just know
how to please white women.

01:36.222 --> 01:38.290
Right? Just, like,
way more than white men.

01:38.324 --> 01:41.392
Oh, well, it's probably
in their blood

01:41.426 --> 01:43.161
'cause they're used
to pleasing their white masters.

01:43.195 --> 01:44.896
Whaaat?

01:44.930 --> 01:46.164
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah!

01:46.198 --> 01:47.331
- Law of the jungle, right?
- (laughs) Totally.

01:47.366 --> 01:49.367
I am so desperate
to find out for myself.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.569
- (laughter)
- Me too.

01:51.603 --> 01:53.838
- Right?

01:53.873 --> 01:57.107
- Okay, um, I'm gonna
go to the bathroom...

01:57.142 --> 01:58.576
Okay.

01:58.610 --> 01:59.943
And I swear to you,

01:59.978 --> 02:02.180
if there is a black guy back there,
I'm gonna blow him.

02:02.214 --> 02:04.748
- (laughter)
- Get it!

02:09.888 --> 02:13.423
So, unrelated, I now
have to go to the bathroom,

02:13.457 --> 02:16.226
uh, because I've been
drinking coffee all day.

02:16.260 --> 02:19.329
So I will be back
in a little while.

02:19.363 --> 02:20.664
Well, you know what?
Let-- Let me go first.

02:20.699 --> 02:25.335
I'll be about 30 seconds.

02:28.372 --> 02:31.708
Ooh, ow.
I hit my penis there.

02:31.742 --> 02:33.510
I'm sorry.
I don't have any money, sir.

02:33.544 --> 02:35.712
Okay.

Hey!

03:06.443 --> 03:08.777
Thank you so much.
I am Keegan-Michael Key.

03:08.811 --> 03:10.579
- I'm Jordan Peele.
- And we are Key and Peele.

03:10.613 --> 03:11.647
Yes.

03:11.681 --> 03:13.049
Thank you for coming out
tonight.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.316
Thank you.

03:14.351 --> 03:16.585
So this is
a little-known fact.

03:16.619 --> 03:19.454
Keegan's wife
is a dialect coach.

03:19.488 --> 03:20.989
Yes, it's a source
of ambivalence for me

03:21.024 --> 03:22.558
because I want her
to have her job

03:22.592 --> 03:23.759
and I want her to thrive,

03:23.793 --> 03:24.993
but there's just a bunch
of British people

03:25.028 --> 03:26.294
just coming through my house,

03:26.328 --> 03:28.196
learning American accents
and taking all our jobs.

03:28.630 --> 03:30.265
So I'm just standing
in the living room,

03:30.299 --> 03:31.433
and these dudes are walking
about like, "Cheerio."

03:31.467 --> 03:33.468
"Yeah, [bleep] you."

03:33.502 --> 03:35.670
- Tea bag.
- Right.

03:35.704 --> 03:37.137
But all right, I want to--
I'm gonna throw you

03:37.172 --> 03:39.373
through a little bit
of a wheel of accents.

03:39.407 --> 03:40.741
- Just give you a little test.
- The wheel of accents.

03:40.776 --> 03:43.611
- (mimics wheel spinning)
- Italian!

03:43.645 --> 03:44.745
(Italian accent)
Oh, Italian.

03:44.780 --> 03:46.347
It's the-- is the one
for me to do.

03:46.381 --> 03:47.548
Yeah. German!

03:47.583 --> 03:51.285
(German accent)
The German is very exact.

03:51.319 --> 03:53.120
- Cockney.
- Cockney's, like, down here,

03:53.154 --> 03:54.488
and it's with the back
of your "froat."

03:54.522 --> 03:55.722
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

03:55.756 --> 03:57.691
You guys must have
some crazy role-play sex.

03:57.725 --> 04:00.294
We do. Yeah.

04:00.328 --> 04:01.795
Just give me an Australian.

04:01.829 --> 04:03.130
(Australian accent)
All right, I can do it.

04:03.164 --> 04:04.398
(laughs)
Yes, yes.

04:04.432 --> 04:06.000
(Jamaican accent)
I can go Jamaican as well.

04:06.034 --> 04:07.534
Oh, that's even better!
That's even better!

04:07.568 --> 04:09.669
I can be a Jamaican.
Okay.

04:09.704 --> 04:10.871
(humming indistinctly)

04:10.905 --> 04:12.405
Where do you want me from?
Oh, there it is.

04:12.439 --> 04:13.874
Where do you want me
to be from?

04:13.908 --> 04:15.742
- Oh, anywhere but you.
- Okay.

04:15.776 --> 04:18.512
Just anywhere--
(laughter)

04:18.546 --> 04:21.113
Can-- Can you do two black guys
at a time?

04:21.148 --> 04:22.516
Can you just give me two?

04:22.550 --> 04:24.450
(laughter)

04:25.986 --> 04:28.221
You sold me out, son.

04:28.255 --> 04:31.124
Now you gonna end up with
a bullet in your head for it.

04:31.158 --> 04:34.427
You can't play me,
mother[bleep].

04:34.461 --> 04:37.897
I'm the mother[bleep]
that plays mother[bleep]s,

04:37.931 --> 04:40.366
Mother[bleep].

04:40.401 --> 04:43.101
Cut.
(bell rings)

04:43.136 --> 04:44.236

04:44.270 --> 04:45.538
All right, everybody,
let's get reset.

04:45.572 --> 04:47.740
We're going again.

04:47.774 --> 04:48.974
Nigel, that's great.

04:49.009 --> 04:50.475
(British accent)
Oh, grea-- smashing.

04:50.510 --> 04:51.877
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

04:51.912 --> 04:54.613
Top-- Well, it's been
an absolute honor and--

04:54.648 --> 04:56.649
and what a great opportunity
to be here

04:56.683 --> 04:58.716
and be able
to play an American tough.

04:58.751 --> 04:59.984
Well, I'm just so glad

05:00.019 --> 05:01.386
that we got you
out of that BBC commitment

05:01.421 --> 05:02.421
so you could play with us, so.

05:02.455 --> 05:04.356
Cheers, mate.
Cheers, cheers.

05:04.390 --> 05:05.623
Antoine, listen.

05:05.658 --> 05:06.891
I'm just not buying
that you're someone

05:06.926 --> 05:10.362
that was born and raised
on the streets of Brooklyn.

05:10.396 --> 05:13.698
That's weird, 'cause, uh,
I actually was born and raised

05:13.732 --> 05:15.066
on the streets of Brooklyn.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.333
Oh.

05:16.368 --> 05:17.835
- (clears throat)
- Oh.

05:17.870 --> 05:19.336
I was in a gang
and everything.

05:19.371 --> 05:21.973
Most of this stuff
actually happened to me.

05:22.007 --> 05:24.075
Wow. Okay.
Well, that's-- that's--

05:24.109 --> 05:26.510
that's great for us,
'cause I want you to use it.

05:26.545 --> 05:27.712
Okay?

05:27.746 --> 05:29.080
It's a good first take.
Let's just, uh--

05:29.114 --> 05:30.414
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's get going it.

05:30.449 --> 05:31.582
Let's get--
Let's get going.

05:31.616 --> 05:33.217
Thank you, Jim.

05:37.989 --> 05:41.758
- And action.
- You sold me out, son.

05:41.793 --> 05:44.661
Now you gonna end up with
a bullet in your head for it.

05:44.696 --> 05:49.532
You can't play me,
mother[bleep].

05:49.567 --> 05:53.070
I'm the mother[bleep]
that plays mother[bleep]s,

05:53.104 --> 05:55.338
Mother[bleep].

05:56.474 --> 05:58.141
(sighs)

05:58.175 --> 05:59.843
Cut. Cut.
(bell rings)

05:59.877 --> 06:01.745
(clears throat)
Okay.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.146
Uh, Nigel.
That was great.

06:03.180 --> 06:04.447
- Oh.
- Brilliant.

06:04.482 --> 06:07.417
Just, the way you move,
especially when you talk.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.586
I just really see this character
coming to life before my eyes.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.853
- Cheers, mate.
- It's fabulous.

06:10.887 --> 06:12.422
- Cheers.
- It's fabulous.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.557
Antoine,
your performance, um,

06:14.592 --> 06:17.594
It's just not quite
there yet, okay?

06:17.628 --> 06:19.829
I-I really need to see you

06:19.863 --> 06:22.498
make more
of a transformation, okay?

06:22.532 --> 06:25.701
Like-- like Nigel, here.

06:25.736 --> 06:28.303
- That dude's British, so.
- Yeah.

06:28.338 --> 06:30.640
Antoine, if I might jump in
with a bit of advice?

06:30.674 --> 06:32.608
- I don't think I need that.
- No, no, no.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.843
Look.
Hear him out.

06:33.877 --> 06:36.411
Maybe you might want to try

06:36.446 --> 06:38.113
thinking of something
in the material

06:38.148 --> 06:39.381
that's similar to something

06:39.415 --> 06:40.682
that's happened
in your real life.

06:40.716 --> 06:43.285
- Hmm.
- For me, for instance,

06:43.319 --> 06:45.554
I like to think
of when me mum wanted me

06:45.588 --> 06:48.290
to attend prep school in Leeds
to become a barrister,

06:48.324 --> 06:50.292
but I wanted to study
the theater at Oxford.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.693
Thank God.

06:51.727 --> 06:53.227
And so that was a conundrum,
really, for me.

06:53.262 --> 06:54.529
(laughs)

06:54.563 --> 06:56.064
I'm gonna stop you
right-- right there,

06:56.098 --> 06:59.367
'cause this is
just confusing me, right?

06:59.401 --> 07:02.403
Like, I don't need that,
'cause I am from the streets.

07:02.437 --> 07:05.173
I was in a gang.

07:05.207 --> 07:08.609
They told me
to kill my cousin.

07:10.186 --> 07:13.013
That might be
a bit spot-on, no?

07:13.048 --> 07:14.649
Yeah.
That's a bit spot-on.

07:14.683 --> 07:18.486
Do you have any stories
that involve your mum?

07:18.520 --> 07:20.154
What's a mum?

07:20.189 --> 07:21.855
Oh, dear.

07:21.890 --> 07:23.658
Scene five, take three.
(bell rings)

07:23.692 --> 07:25.526
Okay.

07:25.561 --> 07:28.162
Antoine, remember.
You're a gangster!

07:28.196 --> 07:32.099
Okay?
Betrayal, the streets.

07:32.133 --> 07:33.967
Okay?
Nigel, you're perfect.

07:34.002 --> 07:36.870
Antoine, transform,
and action!

07:36.905 --> 07:39.606
You sold me out, son.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.543
Now you gonna get a bullet
up in your head for it.

07:43.578 --> 07:47.514
You can't play me,
mother[bleep].

07:47.548 --> 07:50.950
I'm the mother[bleep]
that plays mother[bleep]s,

07:50.984 --> 07:52.352
Mother[bleep].

07:52.386 --> 07:54.688
He's boring to watch.

07:54.722 --> 07:56.456
(sighs)
Cut.

07:56.490 --> 07:57.824
(bell rings)

07:57.858 --> 08:00.593
Oh, that does not
sound good.

08:00.627 --> 08:01.861
(sighs)
Thank you.

08:01.895 --> 08:05.865
Antoine, I do not feel
like you have found

08:05.899 --> 08:08.267
the emotional core
of this character.

08:08.301 --> 08:09.902
Man, [bleep] this!

08:09.937 --> 08:12.571
Nobody is more real than me.
Okay?

08:12.606 --> 08:15.341
I come from the streets,
and nobody's gonna tell me

08:15.375 --> 08:17.042
what the streets is like--
nobody!

08:17.076 --> 08:20.178
You understand?
(sighs)

08:20.213 --> 08:22.548
That's a great speech.
I just wish that I believed it.

08:22.582 --> 08:24.683
- You want to give it a shot?
- Sure. I'll have a go.

08:24.718 --> 08:26.485
(gangster accent)
Man, [bleep] this.

08:26.519 --> 08:28.254
- I'm as real as it gets.
- Yes.

08:28.288 --> 08:29.988
This [bleep] streets
is for real.

08:30.022 --> 08:31.323
I'm up in there, man.

08:31.358 --> 08:33.225
- You are.
- I'm [bleep] from the--

08:33.259 --> 08:36.128
from the [bleep]-- from the earth
from these streets.

08:36.162 --> 08:37.796
- from the eart--
- S-Something to that effect.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.264
That is--
No, but I am so with--

08:39.298 --> 08:40.765
I am with you
when you say that,

08:40.799 --> 08:42.868
even when you're
saying the wrong words.

08:42.902 --> 08:45.637
I just wish
you could do that!

08:45.671 --> 08:47.005
- You know what?
- (grunts)

08:47.039 --> 08:49.607
- (coughs)
- Goodness.

08:49.642 --> 08:51.576
(coughs)

08:51.610 --> 08:54.712
Okay, that hurts,
but I don't feel that it comes

08:54.747 --> 08:57.649
from the right emotional place
for the character.

08:57.683 --> 08:58.949
All right?
Here. Give it a shot.

08:58.984 --> 09:01.218
Give me-- Watch.
Watch.

09:01.253 --> 09:02.687
(grunts, coughs)

09:02.721 --> 09:04.855
That's-- That's great.

09:04.890 --> 09:06.891
- I feel that in here...
- Thank you.

09:06.925 --> 09:08.225
- And in here, in my heart.

09:08.260 --> 09:09.459
That's very gracious of you
to say that.

09:09.494 --> 09:10.594
Try that again.

09:10.628 --> 09:11.962
(grunts, coughs)

09:11.997 --> 09:13.964
I just-- I don't--
(coughs)

09:13.999 --> 09:15.866
I don't believe you.

09:19.496 --> 09:20.696
(soul music)

09:20.830 --> 09:22.532
You guys are familiar
with vanity videos, right?

09:22.566 --> 09:24.767
People who, like,
spend all of their money--

09:24.801 --> 09:26.835
all of their money--
to make a video

09:26.870 --> 09:29.004
in the hopes that someone--
I don't know who--

09:29.039 --> 09:31.306
is gonna discover them
on the Internet and go,

09:31.340 --> 09:33.241
- "This guy's got the goods!"
- Yeah!

09:33.276 --> 09:35.044
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
"I'm gonna make you famous!"

09:35.078 --> 09:36.545
"You got raw talent,"
and it's always--

09:36.580 --> 09:38.747
it's always some kind
of, like--

09:38.782 --> 09:40.783
some convoluted plot
that's like...

09:40.817 --> 09:42.551
- Yeah.
- Part one of a ten-part series.

09:42.586 --> 09:43.986
It's never gonna get finished.

09:44.020 --> 09:46.288
(laughing)
And it's always, like--

09:46.322 --> 09:48.523
It always looks something
like <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

09:48.558 --> 09:49.591
- Yes.
- Always.

09:49.625 --> 09:50.892
It's got, like...

09:50.926 --> 09:52.427
- It's just always...
- Wizards with orbs.

09:52.462 --> 09:53.562
Wizards in it and orbs.
(laughs)

09:53.596 --> 09:54.862
These homemade videos.

09:54.897 --> 09:57.399
It's always like this
fantasy, glam, like...

09:57.433 --> 09:58.800
It's just--
like, they're weird.

09:58.834 --> 10:01.002
- Steampunk [bleep].
- Yeah.

10:01.036 --> 10:03.004
Do we have any--
any steampunks here today?

10:03.038 --> 10:04.939
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

10:04.974 --> 10:08.109
You don't have your, uh,
umbrella with you today, sir.

10:09.678 --> 10:11.212
There's not a lot
of black steampunks out there.

10:11.246 --> 10:12.614
- No.
- Not a lot of--

10:12.648 --> 10:14.315
Ah, dudes talking about,
"Hey, man."

10:14.349 --> 10:15.650
Yeah.

10:15.684 --> 10:17.151

13:25.001 --> 13:26.468
- What?
- I'm grabbing it.

This is yours,
and then that is yours.

What did you see?

13:30.906 --> 13:32.240

- What?

13:32.274 --> 13:33.608
- I got to see her forearms.
- You got?

13:33.642 --> 13:35.377
- A little bit of the thigh.
- Yes. Oh, I saw this.

13:35.411 --> 13:37.077
And I definitely
got some ankle knot.

13:37.112 --> 13:38.846
- You got ankle knot?
- Oh, I got ankle knot.

13:38.881 --> 13:42.316
Oh, the w-w-whole

We are Superman, huh?

13:47.222 --> 13:48.422
Oh!
Shh. Here we go.

13:48.456 --> 13:50.190
Here we go.
Here we go.

13:50.225 --> 13:51.792
Here we go, yeah.

13:53.895 --> 13:56.596
H-h-h-holy tabbouleh.

13:56.631 --> 13:58.432
Would you look
at the leg elbows on that one?

13:58.466 --> 14:00.467
- Mm-hmm.
- Whoo!

14:00.501 --> 14:02.335
I'll tell you what.
Ho, ho, ho!

14:02.369 --> 14:03.703
Ho, ho, ho!

14:03.738 --> 14:08.041
What I wouldn't do
for six seconds with her.

14:08.075 --> 14:10.043
Yes, you would!
Yes, you would!

14:10.077 --> 14:11.311
(laughter)
What would you do?

14:11.345 --> 14:12.511
I'm going to show you
right now.

14:12.546 --> 14:13.546
You're gonna show me?

14:13.580 --> 14:15.114
Spot me!
You got to spot me.

14:15.149 --> 14:16.349
Yes, I am here.
I am here.

14:16.383 --> 14:17.550
Let me tell you
what I would do right now.

14:17.584 --> 14:19.919
I would pump her full of iron,
you know,

14:19.954 --> 14:21.620
and then I would lift her
to the ceiling.

14:21.655 --> 14:23.256
- I'm her.
- Lift her to the ceiling.

14:23.290 --> 14:24.390
- I'm her.
- Working the body.

14:24.425 --> 14:25.658
Working the body.
Working the body.

14:25.692 --> 14:26.959
- Working the body.
- Do it the head.

14:26.993 --> 14:28.661
- Give it to the head.
- Get the head, get the head.

14:28.695 --> 14:30.028
- And you give it to the head.
- Ho! Ho! Belly button.

14:30.063 --> 14:32.397
- Belly button.
- We got belly button.

14:32.432 --> 14:34.500
- Dude, we got belly button.
- Oh, my-- Oh, my God.

14:34.534 --> 14:38.437
(gasps)

14:38.472 --> 14:40.940
(both exhaling)

14:42.875 --> 14:44.509
That's belly button,
my friend.

14:44.543 --> 14:46.044
I couldn't believe
we saw the belly button.

14:46.079 --> 14:47.545
I've never seen the belly button
on a woman before.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.348
I thought it was a myth.

14:49.382 --> 14:51.616
Yes, it's like the butthole
of the belly.

14:51.650 --> 14:52.617
- Mm.
- Mm.

14:52.651 --> 14:54.552
Dig this.

14:54.587 --> 14:56.888
Oh, what I wouldn't do for a--
give me the--

14:56.922 --> 14:58.190
- Show me.
- Give me the ball.

14:58.224 --> 14:59.524
- Show me, show me.
- Give me the ball.

14:59.558 --> 15:00.558
- Show me, show me.
- I'm gonna show you right now.

15:00.593 --> 15:02.026
I'm gonna show it to you
right now.

15:02.060 --> 15:04.161
- What you do? I'm ready.
- I get in here.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.262
- I'm ready.
- And then like this and go--

15:05.297 --> 15:06.464
Ho!
Come on, it feel good.

15:06.499 --> 15:07.632
I get over here
and then I get in there.

15:07.666 --> 15:08.766
- Oh, yeah!
- Grab the hair.

15:08.801 --> 15:10.034
I get into it.
I get into it!

15:10.068 --> 15:11.536
- Hold the hair.
- Hold the hair.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.437
Come on, switch.
Switch positions.

15:13.472 --> 15:14.806
- Let's do it.
- I'm gonna grab your hands.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.041

"$5."

16:31.523 --> 16:34.525
"$5?
How is that possible?"

16:34.559 --> 16:35.892
(cheers and applause)

16:38.597 --> 16:40.563
(rapid knocking on door)

16:43.735 --> 16:45.702
(buzzer)

16:50.975 --> 16:52.876
Hey, man.
How you doing?

16:52.910 --> 16:54.344
You guys got bow and arrows?

16:54.378 --> 16:57.780
Yeah.

16:57.814 --> 16:59.081
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's it.

16:59.116 --> 17:00.383
Yeah, there it is.
There.

17:00.417 --> 17:01.551
That'll do it.
That's gonna do it.

17:01.585 --> 17:02.785
Yup.
Where are the arrows at?

17:02.819 --> 17:04.621
(clears throat)

17:04.655 --> 17:06.289
Yeah.
You got-- you guys got M80s?

17:06.323 --> 17:08.124
We don't carry fireworks.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.425
Damn!
You have, uh--

17:09.460 --> 17:10.992
You have something else
that's explosive

17:11.027 --> 17:13.095
that I could tape
to the end of an arrow?

17:14.497 --> 17:16.632
- We have shotgun shells, but...
- Uh-huh. Ooh.

17:16.665 --> 17:17.967
I feel I have to ask,

17:18.001 --> 17:19.501
are you planning
to attach those to arrows

17:19.535 --> 17:21.036
and use them as a weapon?

17:21.070 --> 17:22.137
What?
No. What?

17:22.172 --> 17:23.372
Are you crazy?
(laughs)

17:23.406 --> 17:24.539
You think
that would work though?

17:24.574 --> 17:26.708
What-- What-- What if I shot
explosive arrows

17:26.742 --> 17:28.577
through a window
to break 'em open?

17:28.611 --> 17:30.579
Sir, I feel like
I have to ask you

17:30.613 --> 17:32.814
what you're planning
to use these for.

17:32.848 --> 17:34.082
Oh, no, I'm not planning
to do anything.

17:34.116 --> 17:35.584
I'm just-- this is
just Christmas shopping.

17:35.618 --> 17:36.685
I'm getting a--
You got zip lines?

17:36.719 --> 17:37.986
Nope.

17:38.020 --> 17:39.154
But you got, like,
hooks and anchors and cables?

17:39.188 --> 17:40.455
We got
some of those things,

17:40.490 --> 17:44.058
but I do not recommend
manufacturing your own zip line.

17:44.093 --> 17:46.161
Oh, I'm not doing that.
No.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.561
Let's say somebody
was manufacturing

17:47.596 --> 17:49.097
- their own zip line.
- Mm-hmm.

17:49.131 --> 17:50.298
You think if they
had busted some windows open

17:50.332 --> 17:51.532
on a building somehow,

17:51.566 --> 17:54.035
Then fired the zip line
off a bow and arrow,

17:54.069 --> 17:55.970
and it attached
to the wall of said building,

17:56.005 --> 17:58.239
that they could just ride
the zip line into the building?

17:58.274 --> 18:00.008
I have no idea.

18:00.042 --> 18:02.243
Sir, whatever you
are planning on doing,

18:02.278 --> 18:03.744
please don't do it.

18:03.779 --> 18:05.179
I'm not-- I'm not--
I'm not doing anything.

18:05.213 --> 18:06.547
I'm just doing
some Christmas shopping,

18:06.581 --> 18:07.682
trying to get it
out of the way.

18:07.716 --> 18:09.016
You know, bow and arrows
for my nephew.

18:09.050 --> 18:11.652
The zip line's for my...
grandmother.

18:11.687 --> 18:13.354
Et cetera and whatnot.
You know what I'm saying there?

18:13.388 --> 18:14.822
It's nothing.
No big deal.

18:14.856 --> 18:16.290
Speaking of other things,
do you guys have

18:16.325 --> 18:20.527
just the, uh, top half
of a knight in armor?

18:20.561 --> 18:22.896
First of all,
it's called a suit of armor.

18:22.931 --> 18:24.497
Oh, yup, that's it.
That's right.

18:24.532 --> 18:26.300
- That's what I meant to say.
- We have one but it's sold...

18:26.334 --> 18:27.901
- Oh!
- As a complete set.

18:27.936 --> 18:29.069
- Yup. Yup.
- Yup.

18:29.103 --> 18:30.304
Yeah,
but the person it's for,

18:30.338 --> 18:31.404
they only need the--
they don't need the--

18:31.439 --> 18:32.605
they just need the top half.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.874
- they don't need the legs.
- Mm-hmm.

18:33.908 --> 18:35.508
Well, what if somebody
was shooting at you and--

18:35.543 --> 18:37.143
what are the chances you think
they'd try to shoot your legs?

18:37.177 --> 18:39.278
I feel
like I have to tell you

18:39.313 --> 18:42.482
that a suit of armor
will not deflect bullets.

18:42.516 --> 18:46.152
I'll take my chances--
with Christmas.

18:46.186 --> 18:48.555
Which brings me, uh,
to my next question.

18:48.589 --> 18:50.724
Do you guys
have roller skates?

18:50.758 --> 18:53.159
- I think we have a pair around.
- Uh-huh.

18:53.193 --> 18:54.626
Let me ask you a question.

18:54.661 --> 18:55.928
How fast do you think you'd have
to be going on roller skates

18:55.963 --> 18:57.429
to get past a couple
of armed guards

18:57.464 --> 18:59.832
and still be going fast enough
to smash through a safe door?

18:59.867 --> 19:02.001
- One of those big bank safes?
- No!

19:02.035 --> 19:03.669
I don-- I don't know.
Yeah.

19:03.703 --> 19:06.505
Yeah? Uh...

19:06.539 --> 19:08.241
Hey, you guys got one of those,
you know, just one

19:08.275 --> 19:10.676
of those big bags with
a dollar sign on the side of it?

19:10.710 --> 19:11.844
- Okay.
- (snorts)

19:11.878 --> 19:13.879
(coughs)
Yeah?

19:13.913 --> 19:16.181
You're gonna shoot arrows with
shotgun shells attached to 'em

19:16.215 --> 19:18.049
to a bank window
to blow out the glass.

19:18.084 --> 19:20.386
then you're gonna shoot
a zip line through that window

19:20.420 --> 19:22.488
and you're gonna slide on
into the hallway.

19:22.522 --> 19:24.256
You're gonna be
wearing roller skates

19:24.290 --> 19:26.358
so you can just skate on past
the armed guards,

19:26.392 --> 19:28.626
who will be shooting at you,
and you're gonna hope

19:28.660 --> 19:30.095
that they both
won't hit your legs,

19:30.129 --> 19:32.197
and, if they are aiming
at your torso,

19:32.231 --> 19:34.432
the suit of medieval armor
will deflect the bullets.

19:34.466 --> 19:36.701
then you're gonna hope
to gather enough speed

19:36.735 --> 19:38.403
to burst through
the big bank vault

19:38.437 --> 19:39.704
at the end of the hallway

19:39.738 --> 19:41.039
where you're gonna
collect the money

19:41.073 --> 19:45.710
in a cartoon money bag.

19:45.744 --> 19:47.311
Well, no.

19:47.345 --> 19:48.780
I'm just an uncle who's buying
some [bleep] for Christmas

19:48.814 --> 19:50.381
And I, uh, think I'll
take my business elsewhere.

19:50.416 --> 19:51.816
Merry Christmas.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.518
It's April.

19:55.453 --> 19:57.320
