Now good night.
- It's about the Dyad tree.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.825
It looks like
it's getting sick again.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.535
- And you're just
bringing this up now?

21:26.618 --> 21:27.744
- Seriously? I've been
trying to say it all day,

21:27.828 --> 21:29.871
but no one would--

21:29.955 --> 21:31.456
listen to me.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.170
Is that...

21:37.254 --> 21:38.714
Ruby's?

21:48.390 --> 21:50.726
Tree sap?

21:50.809 --> 21:53.145
From the Dyad tree?

21:53.228 --> 21:55.063
This is it!

21:55.147 --> 21:57.399
This must be how
Ruby gets her powers!
