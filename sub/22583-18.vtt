WEBVTT

00:09.765 --> 00:10.993
One-quarter impulse.

00:14.565 --> 00:17.955
There appears to be considerable
activity around two of the inner planets.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.201
Numerous ships, all Xindi.

00:20.325 --> 00:22.361
I'm picking up a large array of satellites.

00:22.485 --> 00:24.237
They're generating a detection grid.

00:24.365 --> 00:25.923
Degra mentioned a security net.

00:26.085 --> 00:28.121
Seems like
we've come to the right place.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.076
The planetoid we passed
on the way in...

00:30.205 --> 00:32.320
- put us on the other side of it.
- Aye, sir.

00:33.165 --> 00:35.633
A convoy of ships
is approaching the detection grid.

00:36.005 --> 00:36.994
Let's see them.

00:42.285 --> 00:43.923
Magnify the lead ship.

00:46.765 --> 00:48.164
Show me the warp signature.

00:54.205 --> 00:55.274
Degra.

00:56.365 --> 01:00.677
It may seem odd to celebrate
the completion of a weapon...

01:01.205 --> 01:05.084
particularly one designed to destroy
an entire planet...

01:05.685 --> 01:07.721
but recall the words of Enarchis...

01:07.845 --> 01:11.201
written some 50 years
into the Great Diaspora:

01:12.245 --> 01:13.963
"Without a world of our own...

01:14.525 --> 01:16.481
"we are but children...

01:17.245 --> 01:19.395
"lost in the wilderness."

01:20.205 --> 01:22.480
One day
we'll emerge from this wilderness...

01:22.605 --> 01:26.154
and our work here will ensure
that we'll never be lost again.

01:28.165 --> 01:30.474
To a new era for all Xindi.

01:34.285 --> 01:36.845
It's been a long road

01:39.445 --> 01:41.481
Gettin' from there to here

01:41.645 --> 01:44.443
It's been a long time

01:45.205 --> 01:48.675
But my time is finally near

01:49.165 --> 01:52.555
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:53.405 --> 01:56.238
I will touch the sky

01:56.685 --> 02:00.314
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:00.445 --> 02:03.437
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:03.565 --> 02:07.843
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:08.005 --> 02:11.077
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:11.205 --> 02:15.357
I've got faith to believe

02:15.485 --> 02:18.443
I can do anything

02:18.565 --> 02:22.274
I've got strength of the soul

02:22.885 --> 02:25.877
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:26.005 --> 02:30.203
I can reach any star

02:31.085 --> 02:33.076
I've got faith

02:34.725 --> 02:37.876
I've got faith

02:38.405 --> 02:41.681
Faith of the heart

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.725 --> 02:57.761
Degra, it is good to see you again.

02:57.885 --> 02:58.840
Welcome.

02:58.965 --> 03:00.114
When can we get underway?

03:01.365 --> 03:03.083
Momentarily. Patience.

03:03.525 --> 03:05.277
Patience is for the dead.

03:06.285 --> 03:08.845
You've accomplished a great deal
in a very short time.

03:08.965 --> 03:10.603
We owe you our gratitude.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.480
It's too early
to speak of accomplishments.

03:14.565 --> 03:18.683
I'll reserve my gratitude for when
the humans have been annihilated.

03:24.525 --> 03:26.402
I've analysed every link in the grid.

03:27.005 --> 03:28.643
I can't find a single weakness.

03:28.765 --> 03:30.084
The grid is extremely sensitive.

03:30.205 --> 03:32.355
We'd be detected
the instant we pass through.

03:32.485 --> 03:33.838
We could try disabling it.

03:34.765 --> 03:36.517
It utilises thousands of satellites.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.916
If one of them goes out of commission...

03:39.445 --> 03:40.560
it fills the gap.

03:41.205 --> 03:42.877
What about the Insectoid shuttle?

03:43.365 --> 03:44.798
Make like one of the locals?

03:45.485 --> 03:46.554
We could fly in...

03:47.045 --> 03:49.400
try to locate
where the weapon is being completed.

03:49.525 --> 03:50.924
Their shuttle might be able
to get through...

03:51.045 --> 03:52.683
the grid without raising suspicion.

03:52.805 --> 03:55.842
Captain, we're not exactly experts
at piloting that thing.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.514
It's gonna take at least a couple hours
to get up to speed.

03:58.645 --> 03:59.714
Take them.

03:59.845 --> 04:01.517
I want to launch as soon as we can.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.154
I think I found reverse.

04:12.285 --> 04:14.753
Great. But unless we plan to
fly in ass first...

04:15.165 --> 04:17.315
we better figure out
how to make it go forward.

04:17.445 --> 04:18.719
Can't argue with that.

04:19.485 --> 04:21.793
Let's cycle through
these console settings again.

04:23.085 --> 04:24.279
Try the port actuator.

04:25.085 --> 04:26.120
Here goes.

04:37.965 --> 04:41.594
Commander Tucker is going to need
time to install the translation matrix.

04:41.845 --> 04:45.520
If Commander Tucker wants to speak
Insectoid, I have to get this right first.

04:49.405 --> 04:51.919
Believe it or not,
that was "have a nice day" or...

04:52.525 --> 04:53.640
its equivalent.

05:03.285 --> 05:04.400
Just get in there.

05:04.525 --> 05:06.356
Find this thing, scan it, and get out.

05:06.485 --> 05:09.443
Remember, whatever information
you gather won't do us any good...

05:09.565 --> 05:10.714
unless you bring it back.

05:11.165 --> 05:12.518
We'll keep that in mind.

05:13.565 --> 05:14.554
Good luck.

05:14.685 --> 05:15.720
Thank you, sir.

05:16.085 --> 05:17.200
Thanks, Captain.

05:33.885 --> 05:34.840
Trouble?

05:34.965 --> 05:37.843
It's like steering an asteroid runner
with a bad axis coil.

05:39.125 --> 05:41.514
Their flight path is somewhat erratic.

05:48.805 --> 05:49.999
Open a channel.

05:51.605 --> 05:52.754
Trip?

05:58.285 --> 05:59.559
Sorry.

06:00.245 --> 06:03.203
No problem. I'll send you the bill.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.477
I think I'm getting a feel for her.

06:15.005 --> 06:16.404
Sensors are up and running.

06:18.085 --> 06:19.723
Let's get this show on the road.

06:20.725 --> 06:22.875
Keep a sensor lock
for as long as you can.

06:28.045 --> 06:29.239
500 metres...

06:30.525 --> 06:31.674
200...

06:32.765 --> 06:33.993
here we go.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.243
They're passing through the grid.

06:41.005 --> 06:42.233
We're in.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.241
Xindi patrol ship.
Coming up from behind.

06:48.485 --> 06:49.998
They're hailing us.

06:53.565 --> 06:56.363
Doesn't exactly sound like
"welcome to the neighbourhood."

06:56.725 --> 06:59.717
Hoshi, don't fail us now.

07:02.445 --> 07:06.233
Your presence inside the detection grid
is unauthorised.

07:06.365 --> 07:07.559
Explain.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.633
We had a slight navigational
malfunction that threw us off course.

07:13.765 --> 07:14.993
It has been corrected.

07:29.685 --> 07:32.836
Rendezvous with
your carrier ship immediately.

07:33.645 --> 07:34.794
Understood.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.559
The detection grid
is creating too much interference.

07:44.445 --> 07:45.325
I've lost them.

07:45.325 --> 07:45.563
I've lost them.

07:48.725 --> 07:49.953
We're being scanned.

07:50.085 --> 07:51.359
Where's it coming from?

07:52.285 --> 07:54.515
I'm not picking up any vessels
in the vicinity.

07:54.645 --> 07:57.717
From the moon's surface.
A small monitoring station.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.040
The moon's rotation
brought it in scanning range.

08:00.165 --> 08:01.200
Let's see it.

08:05.165 --> 08:06.439
Malcolm.

08:09.845 --> 08:11.597
I'm reading three Xindi bio-signs.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.556
Have they sent out a transmission?

08:13.685 --> 08:14.674
Not yet.

08:14.965 --> 08:16.284
What are they waiting for?

08:16.405 --> 08:20.114
Probably for the moon's rotation to bring
them back into communication range.

08:20.245 --> 08:21.473
How long?

08:22.525 --> 08:23.514
Four hours.

08:32.684 --> 08:33.879
Target the facility.

08:38.205 --> 08:39.274
Lock.

08:39.405 --> 08:41.236
- Sir.
- We can't risk it.

08:46.565 --> 08:47.634
Fire.

09:06.525 --> 09:08.516
I'm still getting
trace kemocite readings...

09:09.085 --> 09:11.360
but not enough to indicate
a large-scale weapon.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.357
There's not much land down there.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.678
And what land there is
doesn't have any life on it.

09:17.965 --> 09:19.284
Take us down, Travis...

09:20.165 --> 09:21.484
closer to the surface.

09:23.165 --> 09:24.837
Adjust 20 degrees starboard.

09:25.685 --> 09:26.879
See something?

09:27.565 --> 09:28.600
I think so.

09:34.845 --> 09:38.440
You did say most of this thing's power
was routed to structural integrity.

09:38.845 --> 09:42.042
And you said we could probably fly it
inside a gas giant.

09:46.245 --> 09:47.803
Hell, it's only water.

09:56.725 --> 09:58.317
Structural integrity's holding.

09:58.525 --> 09:59.640
Take us deeper.

09:59.845 --> 10:01.563
Negative Z-axis, 10 degrees.

10:29.205 --> 10:30.957
You getting those scans, sir?

10:35.325 --> 10:38.044
There's a lot of activity
around the right lower hemisphere.

10:48.325 --> 10:49.804
I want to have a look inside.

10:53.645 --> 10:55.363
The Captain said get in and get out.

10:57.245 --> 10:59.122
That's exactly what we're going to do.

11:00.165 --> 11:01.280
Aye, aye.

11:10.205 --> 11:12.673
It's definitely in the final phases
of construction.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.524
Most of the work that's going on
seems maintenance-related.

11:15.645 --> 11:17.636
I've gone over the scans
you brought back.

11:18.085 --> 11:19.837
That's the explosive matrix.

11:19.965 --> 11:22.684
If we can get close enough,
we can set off a chain reaction...

11:22.805 --> 11:24.318
that will blow this thing to high heaven.

11:24.445 --> 11:27.562
The initial explosion
would need to be of considerable yield.

11:27.685 --> 11:30.074
A couple of photonic torpedoes
should do the trick.

11:30.205 --> 11:31.638
There's room in the shuttle.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.117
We're talking about a one-way trip.

11:40.405 --> 11:42.635
- I should be the one to go.
- Forget it.

11:42.965 --> 11:45.160
I'm the only one
that can pilot that shuttle.

11:45.285 --> 11:47.435
I practiced on those controls.
I can get her in.

11:47.565 --> 11:48.998
But I've actually done it.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.719
Captain, you want a senior officer
on this, don't you?

11:53.645 --> 11:55.920
- I'll be flying the mission.
- Captain?

11:56.965 --> 11:58.603
How soon can you get it ready?

11:59.085 --> 12:01.315
A couple of hours to get
the torpedoes in place.

12:01.445 --> 12:03.163
Get started.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.556
Meet me in the Launch Bay
in 30 minutes.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.960
- I'm gonna need some flying lessons.
- Aye, sir.

12:34.325 --> 12:36.555
- Welcome aboard, Captain.
- Daniels.

12:37.485 --> 12:39.601
- Where am I?
- You're on Enterprise.

12:39.965 --> 12:43.401
Enterprise-J, to be exact.
A distant relative of your ship.

12:43.885 --> 12:45.398
We're 400 years in the future.

12:57.045 --> 12:59.764
I'm going to assume
you brought me here for a good reason.

12:59.885 --> 13:01.034
Look out there.

13:02.085 --> 13:05.316
It extends 50,000 light-years
in all directions, and it is growing.

13:05.445 --> 13:06.560
I've seen it before.

13:06.925 --> 13:08.836
I know, in the Expanse.

13:09.605 --> 13:11.436
You know about the alien we found?

13:12.405 --> 13:13.554
The test subject?

13:13.765 --> 13:16.233
He belongs to the same race
that built the spheres.

13:16.725 --> 13:19.876
They're altering this space
to make it habitable for their species.

13:20.085 --> 13:23.043
- It's a prelude to invasion.
- We came to the same conclusion.

13:23.165 --> 13:25.759
It's getting harder and harder
to surprise you, Captain.

13:28.845 --> 13:31.234
I've brought you to a monumental event
in history...

13:31.365 --> 13:32.764
the Battle of Procyon 5...

13:32.925 --> 13:35.439
where the Federation
engaged the sphere-builders.

13:36.485 --> 13:39.283
The Federation?
You've mentioned them before.

13:40.045 --> 13:43.958
Vulcans, Andorians, lthenites, Klingons.
Dozens of species, including humans...

13:44.085 --> 13:45.803
all unified in a powerful alliance.

13:48.045 --> 13:49.160
Sphere-builders.

13:56.445 --> 13:58.003
The Federation wins the battle.

13:58.205 --> 14:01.083
They drive the enemy
back into their trans-dimensional realm.

14:01.685 --> 14:03.164
If the Federation had lost...

14:03.285 --> 14:05.401
the sphere-builders would have spread
throughout the galaxy...

14:05.525 --> 14:07.038
they would have wiped out everything.

14:07.165 --> 14:09.076
This species has technology...

14:09.205 --> 14:11.435
which allows them to examine
alternate timelines.

14:11.925 --> 14:13.324
They've seen this future...

14:13.445 --> 14:15.117
and they want to change the outcome.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.724
So they contacted the Xindi...

14:16.845 --> 14:19.359
and convinced them that humanity
was a dangerous threat.

14:19.485 --> 14:21.043
They want the Xindi to destroy us.

14:21.165 --> 14:23.520
Without humanity,
the Federation will never exist.

14:23.725 --> 14:26.956
You have to make the Xindi understand
that humanity isn't the enemy.

14:27.085 --> 14:28.962
In fact, it's humanity
that will protect them...

14:29.085 --> 14:31.394
from the sphere-builders
when this battle is won.

14:31.845 --> 14:33.961
Contact them. Make peace.

14:34.085 --> 14:35.882
They're about to deploy their weapon.

14:36.325 --> 14:38.793
- I know.
- I can't let that happen.

14:38.925 --> 14:41.758
If you destroy their weapon,
they will only build another.

14:41.885 --> 14:45.002
You are the only one who can
convince them of what I have told you.

14:45.125 --> 14:48.162
It is crucial to history
that you do not sacrifice yourself.

14:48.285 --> 14:51.322
My concern is with preventing
the deaths of billions of people.

14:51.445 --> 14:54.562
If that's a problem for history,
then history will have to suffer.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.074
- Then send someone else to...
- I won't do that!

14:57.205 --> 14:58.843
Captain, you have to believe me.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.876
You are making a catastrophic mistake.

15:01.005 --> 15:03.803
- You've made your share of mistakes.
- This isn't one of them.

15:03.925 --> 15:04.880
Send me back.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.758
Send me back now!

15:10.765 --> 15:13.233
Take this. It's Xindi.

15:14.485 --> 15:17.443
A family medal that belongs
to one of the crewmen on this ship.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.601
There are Xindi serving
aboard Enterprise-J.

15:21.765 --> 15:23.403
Why are you giving this to me?

15:25.405 --> 15:26.997
In case you change your mind.

15:29.765 --> 15:30.993
I won't.

15:36.405 --> 15:37.758
I'll have this quantum dated.

15:37.885 --> 15:39.637
We both know it's from the future.

15:41.925 --> 15:43.358
What do you intend to do?

15:43.765 --> 15:45.483
I'm going ahead with the mission.

15:46.885 --> 15:48.238
You don't think I should?

15:48.485 --> 15:51.636
He said you're the only one
who can end the conflict with the Xindi.

15:51.765 --> 15:53.278
You can't do that if you're dead.

15:53.405 --> 15:55.965
That's if you accept
Daniels' version of the future.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.354
He's in a position to know.

15:57.485 --> 16:00.283
I thought you were the skeptical one
when it came to time travel.

16:00.405 --> 16:03.442
Our recent visit to Detroit
has tempered my scepticism.

16:03.805 --> 16:06.842
- You should reconsider your decision.
- What am I supposed to do?

16:06.965 --> 16:09.433
Fly a shuttle into the system
and knock on the door?

16:09.565 --> 16:11.044
Tell the Xindi we want to talk?

16:11.565 --> 16:13.601
The weapon is too close
to being launched.

16:14.325 --> 16:17.874
If the situation were different,
maybe I'd consider it, but I can't.

16:18.085 --> 16:19.404
I don't want you to die.

16:24.925 --> 16:26.153
It's not necessary.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.639
I wish that were true.

16:37.125 --> 16:40.117
I want four ships
to accompany the weapon.

16:40.245 --> 16:42.998
We'll have to generate
an extremely large vortex...

16:43.125 --> 16:44.763
to accommodate that many vessels.

16:44.885 --> 16:46.955
Even after Earth is destroyed...

16:47.165 --> 16:50.077
there will be a residual presence
in this system.

16:50.565 --> 16:52.954
I intend to hunt down...

16:53.085 --> 16:55.918
and eradicate every refugee caravan...

16:57.005 --> 16:58.199
every colony...

16:58.565 --> 17:00.920
every last outpost they have.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.675
A vortex of that size will be
very unstable.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.522
You could lose one or more vessels.

17:05.964 --> 17:07.762
See that we don't.

17:13.845 --> 17:15.039
A message for you.

17:20.085 --> 17:21.358
Go ahead.

17:21.685 --> 17:24.597
Commander, we've lost contact
with one of the lunar outposts.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.359
How long ago?

17:26.605 --> 17:27.753
Two hours.

17:27.885 --> 17:28.920
Send a patrol.

17:30.325 --> 17:32.634
We will resume this when I return.

17:38.605 --> 17:41.756
Someone once said
that dealing with Reptilians...

17:41.925 --> 17:43.517
is like bargaining with the sun.

17:44.365 --> 17:45.844
You make no progress...

17:45.965 --> 17:47.398
and you come away burned.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.639
It's not him.

17:54.005 --> 17:57.441
The last time I saw you like this was
when you delivered the first weapon.

17:58.205 --> 18:00.036
That one only killed 7 million.

18:00.685 --> 18:02.915
This one will destroy an entire world.

18:04.045 --> 18:05.558
Better their world than ours.

18:06.925 --> 18:08.597
That's what I keep telling myself.

18:11.005 --> 18:14.520
But the reality is a good number
of the dead will be innocents...

18:16.125 --> 18:17.524
and children.

18:19.525 --> 18:21.117
It's best not to think about it.

18:23.565 --> 18:25.954
It's difficult
when you have children of your own.

18:28.045 --> 18:29.876
What we do is for them...

18:31.085 --> 18:32.643
for our children's future.

18:34.245 --> 18:35.439
Remember that.

18:40.125 --> 18:43.561
I wonder how they'll remember us.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.320
I know these controls
aren't exactly intuitive.

18:48.525 --> 18:51.085
I think they were built for someone
with compound eyes.

18:51.765 --> 18:52.880
Try again.

19:00.645 --> 19:03.034
Good. You're starting to think
like an Insectoid.

19:03.325 --> 19:04.883
I'll take that as a compliment.

19:05.965 --> 19:07.717
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

19:09.885 --> 19:12.194
You're the least expendable man
on Enterprise.

19:13.645 --> 19:14.919
Why are you doing this?

19:18.645 --> 19:19.680
An hour ago...

19:20.725 --> 19:23.478
I gave the command
to kill three Xindi in cold blood.

19:23.645 --> 19:26.000
A month ago,
I had Phlox create a living being...

19:26.125 --> 19:28.161
in order to use some of its tissue...

19:29.085 --> 19:30.723
and I watched him put it to death.

19:30.845 --> 19:33.405
Sounds like you're saying
this is some sort of penance.

19:33.525 --> 19:35.993
I'm saying
I won't order anyone else to die.

19:40.925 --> 19:43.075
I hate to add to this menagerie
of yours, Doc.

19:44.565 --> 19:45.554
Nonsense.

19:45.805 --> 19:48.524
What's one more mouth to feed?

19:49.165 --> 19:50.837
Just don't harvest any part of him.

19:52.445 --> 19:54.083
I doubt that would be necessary.

19:58.925 --> 20:00.119
Do me a favour.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.878
Slip him a piece of cheese
every now and then.

20:06.085 --> 20:07.200
Certainly.

20:16.645 --> 20:20.035
I've always been much better at
avoiding farewells than giving them...

20:21.645 --> 20:23.203
so I'm not even going to try.

20:25.685 --> 20:29.394
But I'm going to ask all of you
to think back...

20:29.605 --> 20:32.199
to the day when this ship
was first launched.

20:36.325 --> 20:37.997
We were explorers then.

20:41.845 --> 20:44.439
When all this is over,
when Earth is safe...

20:46.125 --> 20:48.195
I want you to get back to that job.

20:51.005 --> 20:53.599
There are 400 billion stars
in our galaxy.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.240
We've only explored a tiny fraction.

20:59.685 --> 21:01.562
You have a lot of work to do.

21:07.525 --> 21:11.040
Of all the captains who will sit
in this chair...

21:13.085 --> 21:16.077
I can't imagine any of them
being more proud than I am right now.

21:38.925 --> 21:40.438
Archer to Enterprise.

21:41.205 --> 21:42.399
I'm heading in.

21:52.085 --> 21:53.404
400 metres...

21:56.925 --> 21:58.040
200.

22:00.205 --> 22:01.797
He's passing through the grid.

22:04.525 --> 22:05.719
He's in.

22:06.045 --> 22:07.478
Give them hell, Captain.

22:08.445 --> 22:09.764
I'll be in the Ready Room.

23:17.365 --> 23:20.755
Unauthorised vessel.
Power down immediately.

23:40.565 --> 23:41.759
Come in.

23:46.525 --> 23:49.198
- Still nothing.
- I'm aware of that.

23:50.565 --> 23:53.682
It's been over two hours. He should
have reached the weapon by now.

23:54.245 --> 23:56.076
Travis and I got there in 25 minutes...

23:56.205 --> 23:57.877
and we didn't know where to look.

24:00.765 --> 24:03.916
You think it's possible our sensors
could have missed the explosion?

24:04.725 --> 24:05.714
Doubtful.

24:08.805 --> 24:10.682
Whatever you're doing, can't it wait?

24:10.805 --> 24:12.033
For what?

24:13.045 --> 24:14.273
Right now...

24:15.725 --> 24:17.443
your place is on the Bridge.

24:18.325 --> 24:20.759
I'll be notified if my presence is needed.

24:22.085 --> 24:24.235
No matter what happens
to the Xindi weapon...

24:24.485 --> 24:26.441
the Captain isn't coming back.

24:26.805 --> 24:28.124
You're in command now.

24:28.245 --> 24:30.475
The crew needs to know
you're on top of things...

24:30.605 --> 24:32.516
and it doesn't help
if you're holed up here.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.556
I don't need any leadership advice.

24:35.285 --> 24:36.559
I'm just trying to help.

24:38.525 --> 24:40.356
This isn't easy for any of us.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.160
T'Pol?

24:46.165 --> 24:48.838
- Dismissed.
- Dismissed?

24:51.405 --> 24:52.440
Get out.

25:05.565 --> 25:07.237
Answer the question!

25:08.685 --> 25:10.277
Repeat the question.

25:11.125 --> 25:14.117
How many Earth vessels
have entered the Expanse?

25:14.245 --> 25:17.282
I wish I could help you but...

25:18.125 --> 25:20.639
my superiors keep me in the dark
about these things.

25:21.765 --> 25:23.995
Is this a pre-emptive strike?

25:24.125 --> 25:25.797
I thought that was your specialty.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.155
You don't want to know my specialty.

25:28.285 --> 25:29.434
Let me guess...

25:31.205 --> 25:32.843
stinking up the room?

25:36.805 --> 25:40.559
I had no idea that humans
were so resilient.

25:41.085 --> 25:44.919
It's not a trait found in most
primate species.

25:45.045 --> 25:46.194
Including the Xindi?

25:46.685 --> 25:49.358
There's a reason Reptilians
are called upon...

25:49.485 --> 25:52.283
when force must be applied.

25:53.005 --> 25:56.441
It was a Reptilian who piloted
the weapon that attacked your world.

25:56.725 --> 25:57.953
Friend of yours?

25:58.205 --> 25:59.797
He was from my regiment.

26:00.245 --> 26:02.156
I selected him myself.

26:02.685 --> 26:04.198
You must be very proud.

26:04.325 --> 26:06.077
His name will go down in history.

26:06.685 --> 26:08.357
It will be spoken with reverence.

26:08.485 --> 26:11.158
A testament to the superiority...

26:11.805 --> 26:13.397
of the cold-blooded.

26:14.405 --> 26:15.997
I'll bet you didn't know this...

26:16.365 --> 26:19.562
but at one time,
most of my world was ruled by reptiles.

26:19.765 --> 26:21.278
I wasn't aware of that.

26:21.405 --> 26:24.761
A comet hit around 65 million
years ago...

26:25.445 --> 26:27.003
caused a mass extinction.

26:27.365 --> 26:29.083
Most of the reptiles died out.

26:29.685 --> 26:32.074
Mammals became
the dominant species.

26:32.205 --> 26:33.274
How unfortunate.

26:33.645 --> 26:36.364
Still, the reptiles might have
come out on top...

26:36.965 --> 26:39.195
if it hadn't been for
a slight disadvantage.

26:39.685 --> 26:40.720
And what was that?

26:41.405 --> 26:43.316
They had brains the size of a walnut.

26:45.765 --> 26:47.084
That's very small.

26:48.325 --> 26:51.874
Apparently, it's a constant
in the universe.

26:55.565 --> 26:57.123
Earth vessels...

26:58.405 --> 26:59.963
how many?

27:01.405 --> 27:03.043
The reptiles didn't all die out.

27:03.805 --> 27:06.922
Some evolved into snakes, alligators...

27:07.645 --> 27:08.634
turtles.

27:08.765 --> 27:11.233
As a matter of fact, one of my favorite
restaurants in San Francisco...

27:11.365 --> 27:13.833
makes the most wonderful turtle soup.

27:14.285 --> 27:16.879
You should try it sometime
if you're ever in the area.

27:19.085 --> 27:22.122
You want me to kill you?

27:23.205 --> 27:24.843
I'm just making conversation.

27:26.725 --> 27:28.602
Relaying a few interesting facts...

27:29.845 --> 27:31.836
about the world you're trying to destroy.

27:32.365 --> 27:36.836
I'll reciprocate
with an interesting fact of my own.

27:39.885 --> 27:43.400
We know exactly where your ship is.

27:46.525 --> 27:47.514
Is that so?

27:48.525 --> 27:52.837
When we lost contact with our lunar
outpost, we scanned the vicinity...

27:53.445 --> 27:54.924
and discovered it...

27:55.965 --> 27:57.193
hiding.

27:58.845 --> 28:02.838
Unless you tell me
exactly what I want to know...

28:03.245 --> 28:05.713
I'll dispatch a squadron...

28:05.885 --> 28:08.240
right now.

28:12.005 --> 28:13.882
No more conversation?

28:18.565 --> 28:22.444
I hope you had a chance
to say goodbye to your crew.

28:24.565 --> 28:25.759
All right.

28:27.325 --> 28:28.758
But I'll only talk to Degra.

28:31.005 --> 28:32.358
- Degra?
- Alone.

28:33.885 --> 28:35.159
I don't know who that is.

28:35.365 --> 28:36.844
He's building your weapon.

28:37.725 --> 28:39.078
Ring a bell now?

28:40.525 --> 28:44.438
What makes you think Degra
would be interested in talking to you?

28:46.045 --> 28:47.114
Just tell him...

28:47.965 --> 28:51.401
the name of his third child, Trenia.

28:52.685 --> 28:54.641
Degra has only two children.

28:54.885 --> 28:56.000
Prove me wrong.

28:57.285 --> 28:58.354
Tell him.

28:59.205 --> 29:02.277
Sensors would have easily detected
an explosion of that magnitude...

29:03.085 --> 29:04.154
even underwater.

29:04.725 --> 29:05.874
I say we go in.

29:06.125 --> 29:07.240
Get as close as we can...

29:07.365 --> 29:09.674
- and try to take out the weapon.
- Agreed.

29:09.805 --> 29:11.523
This system is heavily guarded.

29:11.645 --> 29:14.113
Our chances of reaching the weapon
are nonexistent.

29:14.245 --> 29:15.917
We can't just sit here.

29:16.205 --> 29:17.684
What do you propose we do?

29:19.005 --> 29:21.200
There's still a chance
the Captain may succeed.

29:22.005 --> 29:25.236
The longer we wait here, the greater
the likelihood we'll be spotted.

29:27.925 --> 29:30.200
If we don't hear from the Captain
in one hour...

29:31.805 --> 29:33.761
I'll pilot a shuttlepod into the system.

29:34.725 --> 29:35.794
And do what?

29:36.525 --> 29:39.278
- Attempt a diplomatic solution.
- You've got to be kidding.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.198
You can't possibly believe
that has any chance of success.

29:42.325 --> 29:43.644
The odds aren't promising...

29:43.765 --> 29:47.201
but the fact that I'm Vulcan
may help me establish a dialogue.

29:48.205 --> 29:50.275
You'll just be captured or killed.

29:50.405 --> 29:51.520
Perhaps.

29:51.645 --> 29:54.365
But at the moment,
I don't see an alternate course of action.

30:02.125 --> 30:03.478
Hello again.

30:06.365 --> 30:07.798
How do you know me?

30:08.965 --> 30:10.159
Long story.

30:10.685 --> 30:12.403
Repeat what you told him.

30:13.005 --> 30:15.075
The name of your third child is Trenia.

30:21.485 --> 30:22.804
Leave me alone with him...

30:24.205 --> 30:25.479
and take him, as well.

30:41.485 --> 30:44.841
Three months into the pregnancy
your wife contracted Anaprolean Fever.

30:45.125 --> 30:46.638
You lost the child.

30:47.285 --> 30:48.957
You were going to name it Trenia.

30:51.805 --> 30:53.557
I've never told that to anyone.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.913
You told it to me.

30:55.045 --> 30:57.081
You also talked about
the weapon you designed.

30:57.205 --> 30:59.161
The one that killed 7 million people.

30:59.285 --> 31:01.162
When you watched
the telemetry come in...

31:01.285 --> 31:04.357
you wondered how many
of those 7 million were children.

31:04.765 --> 31:05.880
Who are you?

31:06.005 --> 31:08.473
It doesn't matter who I am
or how I know all this.

31:08.605 --> 31:11.199
What's important is
that you listen to what I have to say.

31:12.645 --> 31:13.873
Continue.

31:16.405 --> 31:20.956
Your reason for building this weapon is
based on a lie.

31:21.285 --> 31:22.764
What lie would that be?

31:22.885 --> 31:24.477
That at some point in the future...

31:24.605 --> 31:27.039
humans are going to destroy
your species.

31:27.165 --> 31:29.281
That is not a lie!

31:30.445 --> 31:31.878
You know about the spheres?

31:32.565 --> 31:34.556
- Of course.
- They were constructed...

31:34.925 --> 31:36.597
by trans-dimensional beings.

31:37.045 --> 31:39.195
Their purpose is to reconfigure
the Expanse...

31:39.325 --> 31:41.520
to make it habitable for their species.

31:41.725 --> 31:44.717
That's what destroys the Xindi,
not humanity.

31:44.845 --> 31:46.119
I've studied the spheres.

31:46.245 --> 31:48.713
There is no evidence
to support what you're saying.

31:48.845 --> 31:50.039
I've seen it happen.

31:52.325 --> 31:53.599
I've been to the future...

31:54.525 --> 31:56.675
400 years into the future.

31:56.805 --> 31:59.114
You expect me to believe that?

32:02.245 --> 32:05.442
There's an artefact in my right pocket.
Take it.

32:06.845 --> 32:08.039
Go ahead.

32:16.405 --> 32:17.724
An initiation medal.

32:18.325 --> 32:19.553
Have it quantum dated.

32:20.725 --> 32:22.204
The results will back me up.

32:22.565 --> 32:24.203
You could have gotten it anywhere.

32:24.325 --> 32:26.077
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

32:26.205 --> 32:29.117
It wasn't any easier for me to
swallow this than it is for you...

32:29.245 --> 32:32.237
but you'd better understand something.
If you destroy Earth...

32:32.365 --> 32:34.435
you won't just be eliminating
my species...

32:34.565 --> 32:36.157
you'll be eliminating your own.

32:47.965 --> 32:51.355
The quantum dating confirms it.
It's from the future.

32:51.485 --> 32:53.794
That doesn't prove
the human is telling the truth.

32:53.925 --> 32:55.961
If there's any truth in what he's saying...

32:56.485 --> 32:58.077
it means we can't trust her.

32:58.525 --> 33:01.483
It also means she's been dealing
with the Reptilians secretly.

33:01.605 --> 33:03.004
Archer told you this?

33:03.125 --> 33:04.922
He said he saw Reptilians on Earth...

33:05.365 --> 33:07.196
in a place called Detroit...

33:07.845 --> 33:09.437
over 100 years in the past.

33:09.725 --> 33:10.794
The past?

33:10.925 --> 33:12.756
So now he's a time traveller?

33:13.005 --> 33:16.202
According to the human,
they were developing a bio-weapon.

33:17.205 --> 33:18.638
The Council prohibited that.

33:18.805 --> 33:21.114
He spoke of it in great detail.

33:22.045 --> 33:24.764
If the Reptilians wanted
to keep their actions a secret...

33:24.885 --> 33:26.876
the past would be a good place to do it.

33:27.445 --> 33:29.197
How would they get to the past?

33:31.245 --> 33:33.122
She may have taken them.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.197
- We have to investigate this.
- And quickly.

33:36.325 --> 33:37.804
The weapon's been moved
to a safe location...

33:37.925 --> 33:39.404
but it's nearly ready to be deployed.

33:39.525 --> 33:41.720
The Council must be informed.

33:41.845 --> 33:44.484
Reptilians sit on the Council,
or have you forgotten?

33:45.165 --> 33:48.521
If they did go behind our backs,
we shouldn't reveal what we've learned.

33:48.645 --> 33:49.634
Not yet.

33:49.765 --> 33:51.357
What about the Aquatics?

33:51.485 --> 33:53.282
We can inform them in secret.

33:54.285 --> 33:57.436
All of this collusion is dangerous.

33:58.125 --> 33:59.638
The Council is fracturing.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.878
We can't forget who the real enemy is.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.481
We may not know
who the real enemy is.

34:10.284 --> 34:11.638
What happens if you fail?

34:11.764 --> 34:14.916
Are we supposed to just keep sending
people in until there's no one left?

34:15.045 --> 34:18.196
That's hardly a viable option.
We only have one more shuttlepod.

34:19.284 --> 34:20.638
You're missing my point.

34:21.804 --> 34:23.158
I don't think you're doing this
to make peace...

34:23.284 --> 34:25.116
I think you want to try
and save the Captain.

34:25.245 --> 34:26.199
You're wrong.

34:26.324 --> 34:28.440
Why do I get the feeling
you haven't thought this through?

34:28.565 --> 34:30.317
You have made your objections clear.

34:30.445 --> 34:31.719
Now return to the Bridge.

34:31.844 --> 34:34.074
I'm not just gonna sit still
and watch you fly off and die.

34:34.205 --> 34:35.684
- I gave you an order.
- T'Pol.

34:35.804 --> 34:37.443
- Let go of me!
- I won't let you do this.

34:37.565 --> 34:39.635
- I said let go!
- What the hell's wrong with you?

34:39.764 --> 34:41.039
Bridge to T'Pol.

34:43.405 --> 34:44.520
Go ahead.

34:44.645 --> 34:47.795
There's no need to go to the Xindi.
It appears they're coming to us.

34:57.325 --> 34:59.714
Four Xindi vessels closing fast.

35:00.005 --> 35:01.279
Hail them.

35:04.085 --> 35:05.438
No response.

35:05.725 --> 35:07.204
They're charging weapons.

35:09.125 --> 35:11.002
What exactly are you proposing?

35:13.965 --> 35:15.284
That we trust each other.

35:16.525 --> 35:20.643
You were captured behind the controls
of a ship armed with explosives.

35:21.405 --> 35:23.555
You're asking for our trust?

35:24.125 --> 35:26.639
You're building a weapon
that could destroy my world.

35:26.805 --> 35:28.363
I had to try and stop you.

35:28.605 --> 35:32.154
And now that your mission has failed,
you want to negotiate.

35:37.605 --> 35:39.118
Just consider what I said.

35:39.685 --> 35:42.483
You maintain
that by destroying your world...

35:42.605 --> 35:44.835
we'll be ensuring our own annihilation.

35:45.245 --> 35:46.314
That's right.

35:46.445 --> 35:50.882
Because it's humankind
that ultimately saves the Xindi...

35:51.005 --> 35:53.041
from these sphere-builders.

35:53.565 --> 35:55.317
We're both fighting the wrong enemy.

35:56.245 --> 36:00.397
I'm afraid it'll take more
than this antique...

36:00.725 --> 36:01.919
to convince us.

36:02.045 --> 36:04.605
Quantum dating has produced
inaccurate results before.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.915
Do you believe these results
are inaccurate?

36:11.445 --> 36:13.481
Let me speak to this Council of yours.

36:13.645 --> 36:14.634
Present my case.

36:14.765 --> 36:17.518
Some members of the Council
would sooner execute you than listen.

36:17.645 --> 36:19.237
Then help me change their minds.

36:19.365 --> 36:20.957
You haven't changed ours.

36:22.285 --> 36:23.638
I've made an impression...

36:25.365 --> 36:26.878
or you wouldn't still be here.

36:39.445 --> 36:41.197
We've lost hull plating!

36:43.805 --> 36:45.682
I still don't have helm control.

36:46.085 --> 36:47.564
T'Pol to Engineering.

36:58.285 --> 36:59.798
Engineering, report!

37:05.125 --> 37:07.559
That last hit took out
the starboard nacelle.

37:07.685 --> 37:09.004
We're dead in the water.

37:09.805 --> 37:10.954
Bridge!

37:15.485 --> 37:16.759
Comm is down.

37:18.165 --> 37:19.393
Get it back.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.240
Restrain him.

37:35.045 --> 37:37.843
- We're not finished.
- You've had enough time.

37:39.285 --> 37:41.719
Has he revealed
the location of his forces?

37:41.845 --> 37:43.642
We've been discussing other matters.

37:43.765 --> 37:45.642
There are no other matters.

37:47.125 --> 37:48.604
Take them back to their ship.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.124
We're not going anywhere.

37:53.845 --> 37:55.483
You can't threaten us.

37:55.605 --> 37:56.799
Return to your ship.

37:57.805 --> 37:58.954
What about him?

37:59.085 --> 38:02.714
He's going to a detention centre
for more questioning.

38:03.845 --> 38:07.804
If there are any survivors from his ship,
they'll join him.

38:08.645 --> 38:09.680
Survivors?

38:09.805 --> 38:11.284
Your ship's under attack.

38:11.845 --> 38:13.563
You agreed to hold off!

38:13.685 --> 38:15.164
We grew tired of waiting.

38:15.285 --> 38:17.480
- Call off your vessels.
- I don't answer to you.

38:17.605 --> 38:18.833
I'll assemble the Council.

38:18.965 --> 38:22.435
By the time you do,
the Earth ship will be dust.

38:43.125 --> 38:47.277
We've got hull breaches on C, D, and E.

38:47.405 --> 38:48.679
Close them off.

38:48.805 --> 38:50.557
The bulkheads aren't responding!

38:52.565 --> 38:54.157
We're venting atmosphere!

39:12.165 --> 39:14.315
- Get him to Sickbay!
- Yes, sir!

39:16.605 --> 39:18.118
Tucker to the Bridge!

39:18.245 --> 39:21.555
If you can hear me,
I've got coolant leaks all over the place.

39:21.685 --> 39:23.198
We're evacuating.

39:26.845 --> 39:28.358
Everybody out!

39:29.305 --> 39:35.599
