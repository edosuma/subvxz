WEBVTT

01:09.523 --> 01:12.674
Majesty... the town of Thera
is under attack.

01:13.213 --> 01:16.213
It seems Pasiphae has
learnt of the king's death.

01:20.356 --> 01:21.404
Then we are at war.

02:06.364 --> 02:08.363
Lord Sarpedon?

02:08.364 --> 02:10.383
Who are you? We mean you no harm.

02:10.383 --> 02:14.343
Queen Ariadne sent us to escort you
to Atlantis. Thera has fallen.

02:14.344 --> 02:16.404
If we are to escape,
we must leave now.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.400
This is madness!

02:24.388 --> 02:26.348
Hercules!

02:41.392 --> 02:44.328
Pythagoras!

02:59.360 --> 03:01.352
We should head for the North Gate.

03:10.396 --> 03:12.388
No! No!

03:13.388 --> 03:15.311
We can't save everyone.

03:15.312 --> 03:17.399
We have to try. Head for the Hiros
valley. I'll meet you there.

03:17.400 --> 03:21.351
Jason! That boy is nothing
but trouble.

03:21.352 --> 03:23.327
You heard him! Head for the valley!

03:23.328 --> 03:24.392
Run!

03:39.328 --> 03:42.392
If you're done playing the hero,
we have to get out of here now!

03:48.344 --> 03:50.324
Rest.

03:54.364 --> 03:58.379
Thera is ours.
Atlantis will not fall so easily.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.407
Their walls have never been
breached.

04:00.408 --> 04:03.367
You forget,
I know the city better than anyone.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.395
What makes you think that you can
succeed where so many have failed?

04:06.396 --> 04:09.391
Deep within the royal vault there is
a statue called the Palladium.

04:09.392 --> 04:12.403
It is said Atlantis will never fall
while it remains within its walls.

04:12.404 --> 04:14.387
You believe this to be true?

04:14.388 --> 04:16.351
I have held it in my hands.

04:16.351 --> 04:18.394
It carries the power of the gods.

04:18.396 --> 04:22.343
Then any attempt to take
Atlantis is doomed.

04:22.344 --> 04:25.388
Just be sure that your men are ready
to strike when the time is right.

04:36.404 --> 04:38.367
Is something wrong, my Lord?

04:38.368 --> 04:42.368
It's many years
since I left Atlantis.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.408
I didn't know
if I would ever return.

04:56.380 --> 05:00.339
Lord Sarpedon.
My prayers have been answered.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.319
I'm so relieved that you are safe.

05:02.320 --> 05:07.331
It was thanks to you.
If you had not sent your men...

05:07.332 --> 05:10.316
I am for ever in your debt.

05:11.348 --> 05:14.371
It causes me great sadness that
I was not reconciled with

05:14.372 --> 05:16.395
the king before he died.

05:16.396 --> 05:19.395
Whatever ill feeling there was
between you, it is in the past.

05:19.396 --> 05:23.319
These are dark times
and I will need your council.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.383
I would be honoured to
serve my queen.

05:25.384 --> 05:28.339
Now tell me. What news from Thera?

05:28.340 --> 05:30.359
Pasiphae's men were merciless.

05:30.360 --> 05:33.376
Her banishment has made her
hungry for revenge.

05:35.324 --> 05:38.352
Prepare to lose your shirt, your
trousers and your undergarments.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.347
Yes!

05:43.348 --> 05:46.336
It's usually you that loses
the shirt on your back.

06:33.356 --> 06:35.356
That will be all.

06:52.348 --> 06:54.336
Everything is ready, Medea.

08:24.380 --> 08:29.319
Eith' Hekate doie menos ifthimon ede

08:29.320 --> 08:33.312
moi alken hos anapeptamenosi
pro mu kaleontos hapanta!

10:20.372 --> 10:21.384
Halt!

11:22.372 --> 11:24.363
The gods have spoken.

11:24.364 --> 11:27.360
Something must have happened to have
angered Poseidon like that.

11:40.336 --> 11:42.328
They're here.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.372
You will have felt Poseidon's anger.
There is good reason for it.

11:57.336 --> 12:01.324
Less than an hour ago,
the Palladium was stolen.

12:04.316 --> 12:07.335
Does anyone know it's been taken?
Only those present in this room.

12:07.336 --> 12:10.403
Pasiphae is marching
on Atlantis as we speak.

12:10.404 --> 12:12.387
If the army find out about this,

12:12.388 --> 12:15.332
they will desert
and the city will fall.

12:16.408 --> 12:18.403
You want us to retrieve it?

12:18.404 --> 12:20.380
I do not ask it lightly.

12:22.336 --> 12:25.323
But there is no-one else
I can turn to.

12:25.324 --> 12:28.347
The Colchean army are camped
in the Icaria Valley.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.399
If the Palladium is anywhere,
it will be there.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.324
Then you have my word.

12:34.364 --> 12:36.344
I will not fail you.

12:37.348 --> 12:38.388
May the Gods be with you.

12:47.376 --> 12:50.395
Do you really believe
Jason will be successful?

12:50.396 --> 12:53.408
He has never failed me.

12:56.404 --> 13:00.324
Would it be wrong to think that you
have feelings for him?

13:01.368 --> 13:05.324
Even as a young girl, I could always
tell what you were thinking.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.383
When my father died I swore
that my duty to Atlantis would

13:08.384 --> 13:13.360
come before all else,
including any feelings I might have.

13:14.404 --> 13:19.372
In these difficult times, we are
all forced to make hard choices.

13:23.396 --> 13:27.335
I doubt the thief could have entered
the palace without help.

13:27.336 --> 13:29.371
You think they had an accomplice?

13:29.372 --> 13:33.387
Almost certainly. Everyone
in the palace is to be questioned.

13:33.388 --> 13:36.380
I will not tolerate
traitors in my court.

13:47.316 --> 13:49.367
Gather some supplies.
We'll leave at first light.

13:49.368 --> 13:51.315
Where are you going?

13:51.316 --> 13:52.436
There's something I must do.

13:56.404 --> 13:59.348
I've been expecting you.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.344
The gods have spoken.

14:08.364 --> 14:10.363
A new dawn is beginning.

14:10.364 --> 14:13.327
It is time.

14:13.328 --> 14:15.311
Time for what?

14:15.312 --> 14:17.367
I have done my best to guide you

14:17.368 --> 14:22.320
but there are some things that you
must see for yourself.

14:29.368 --> 14:33.344
Clear your mind of all thoughts.

14:37.336 --> 14:41.384
Don't fight it.
Let the Kykeon wash over you.

14:47.404 --> 14:49.368
You will see with my eyes.

14:52.344 --> 14:55.343
'Aw kluthi Phoib' hairmawn,
theh-eh krairzmoo thespessioyo

14:55.344 --> 14:58.364
'tairloss eh-ar horra-arn hotty
tondy kewkyawna piawmen.'

15:22.356 --> 15:23.384
What was that?

15:25.352 --> 15:28.407
It is the fate that awaits us all.

15:28.408 --> 15:32.368
Last night, we took the first
steps along this path.

15:38.348 --> 15:41.407
Only you can stop
this from coming to pass.

15:41.408 --> 15:46.332
How? Surely that's beyond anyone?

15:47.352 --> 15:52.319
Anyone, except you.
You are not like ordinary men.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.348
You must embrace your destiny.

16:22.340 --> 16:23.408
Soi kharin oid' Harpuia...

16:30.340 --> 16:31.460
..pathon hypo su tade werga.

16:56.404 --> 16:58.312
Medea.

17:01.372 --> 17:05.323
I was beginning to worry.
Did everything go as planned?

17:05.324 --> 17:06.384
You have the Palladium?

17:12.387 --> 17:16.330
When I took it from the plinth,
the earth shook.

17:16.332 --> 17:19.356
I have never see such power.

17:21.311 --> 17:27.319
You are a Princess of Colchis.
You should not fear anything.

17:31.312 --> 17:33.396
It senses our power.

17:37.392 --> 17:41.372
There is nothing that can stop us
taking Atlantis now.

17:47.376 --> 17:49.407
I believe you volunteered us
to retrieve

17:49.408 --> 17:53.387
the Palladium from under the nose
of the entire Colchean army.

17:53.388 --> 17:56.343
Ariadne had no-one else
she could turn to.

17:56.344 --> 17:58.331
You expect him to see sense,

17:58.332 --> 18:00.359
but it strikes me
that love is entirely nonsensical.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.379
No matter how many times you
risk your life,

18:02.380 --> 18:04.331
you're not of royal blood.

18:04.332 --> 18:05.407
You and Ariadne can never be
together.

18:05.408 --> 18:08.347
And if you think otherwise,
you're a fool,

18:08.348 --> 18:09.403
and you will die a fool's death.

18:09.404 --> 18:12.359
That might have sounded a little
harsher than I meant it to.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.339
This is about more than Ariadne.
I have to do this.

18:15.340 --> 18:17.327
Why do you believe that?

18:17.328 --> 18:20.343
Ever since I came to Atlantis I've
been told I have a destiny,

18:20.344 --> 18:21.383
a purpose.

18:21.384 --> 18:25.360
For the first time, I think
I understand it.

18:30.340 --> 18:36.367
O thanate, psukhas tautas nun pempe
thanonton tele pros Elusion

18:36.368 --> 18:38.404
pedion kai peirata gaies.

18:47.372 --> 18:49.399
I always believed him
to be invincible.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.383
As did he.

18:52.384 --> 18:56.315
When we were children
we would climb into the bull pens

18:56.316 --> 19:00.331
and wait for the bulls to
turn on us.

19:00.332 --> 19:02.395
Minos was always the last
to jump out.

19:02.396 --> 19:06.363
He remembered the times you spent
together fondly.

19:06.364 --> 19:11.359
As do I, but when he sent me
into exile...

19:11.360 --> 19:16.403
..it hurt more... than I can say.

19:16.404 --> 19:19.399
I know my father
regretted his decision.

19:19.400 --> 19:25.311
He believed I plotted to
overthrow him, but he misjudged me.

19:25.312 --> 19:26.407
I was always loyal.

19:26.408 --> 19:28.376
He knew that.

19:30.348 --> 19:31.403
What is it?

19:31.404 --> 19:34.364
It appears we have caught
the intruder's accomplice.

19:38.328 --> 19:41.339
We found him
with blood on his clothing.

19:41.340 --> 19:44.331
When questioned,
he attempted to flee.

19:44.332 --> 19:46.343
Was anyone else from the palace
involved?

19:46.344 --> 19:48.312
He is refusing to say.

19:49.352 --> 19:50.512
Then he must be made to talk.

20:15.396 --> 20:17.344
Colcheans!

20:30.332 --> 20:32.347
So what's the plan?

20:32.348 --> 20:35.363
The plan for when we're pinned down,
surrounded and vastly outnumbered?

20:35.364 --> 20:38.399
Yes, that plan. Well, I suppose we
could die in this ditch making a stand,

20:38.400 --> 20:42.407
or we could die fighting for our lives
amongst the trees. That's it..?

20:42.408 --> 20:45.407
On the count of three. One, two...

20:45.408 --> 20:49.407
Why is it always three?
It's very interesting.

20:49.408 --> 20:53.356
Why not four, or five or...?

20:54.396 --> 20:56.355
Sorry.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.340
Three!

20:59.344 --> 21:01.376
Whoa.

21:40.368 --> 21:41.400
Wah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:47.388 --> 21:50.392
I think our horses
may have bolted.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.327
No, please.

22:10.328 --> 22:13.355
You slaughter women and children,
and beg us for mercy?

22:13.356 --> 22:16.352
I was forced to fight.
I'm begging you. Kill him.

22:18.312 --> 22:19.316
He's unarmed.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.343
I can't kill him in cold blood.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.355
Pick up the sword.

22:26.356 --> 22:29.364
Pick up the sword or
die like a coward!

22:32.372 --> 22:36.379
Pick it up.
I can't... I won't...

22:36.380 --> 22:39.344
Hercules...

22:44.332 --> 22:46.367
We can't execute an unarmed man.

22:46.368 --> 22:49.372
Letting him go could jeopardise
the entire mission.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.360
Logic dictates we kill him.

22:57.324 --> 23:00.368
You'll have to do it,
because I won't.

23:07.384 --> 23:09.352
Very well.

23:13.348 --> 23:17.319
Please. No... No, please, I'm
begging you. Don't.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.331
Reason demands it.

23:18.332 --> 23:21.403
I won't fight for the Colcheans
again, I swear. I swear on my life.

23:21.404 --> 23:24.355
There are bigger things at stake
than one man's life.

23:24.356 --> 23:29.320
Please... Please... Please...

23:39.316 --> 23:43.320
No. I can't do it.

23:46.364 --> 23:49.351
It's all right.
Where are you from?

23:49.352 --> 23:51.391
Tamos.
All I want is to do is go home.

23:51.392 --> 23:54.319
Well, then you should start walking.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.396
Thank you. Thank you.

24:02.404 --> 24:04.380
On your head be it.

24:35.312 --> 24:37.320
Drink.

24:43.384 --> 24:46.319
They can torture me all they like.

24:46.320 --> 24:50.379
I have told them what you asked me
to, no more.

24:50.380 --> 24:54.352
You are loyal,
and you have served me well.

24:56.324 --> 24:58.343
I am truly sorry for what
I have done.

24:58.344 --> 25:02.404
I cannot afford to take the risk.
Don't fight it.

25:24.368 --> 25:26.344
Do you believe it's true?

25:28.324 --> 25:30.360
What he says about his destiny?

25:31.384 --> 25:35.363
I believe he's faster than any man
I've ever seen.

25:35.364 --> 25:39.383
He can look at Medusa without
being turned to stone.

25:39.384 --> 25:42.391
What's our part in this?

25:42.392 --> 25:46.311
It seems our destiny is to die,

25:46.312 --> 25:48.363
following him
on this suicide mission.

25:48.364 --> 25:50.375
Before Jason came into our lives,

25:50.376 --> 25:53.387
you wouldn't have followed
anyone for any kind of mission.

25:53.388 --> 25:57.327
It was a struggle to get you
out of the tavern.

25:57.328 --> 25:59.323
That is a barefaced lie!

25:59.324 --> 26:00.395
Is it?

26:00.396 --> 26:03.323
No.

26:03.324 --> 26:08.327
I've spent my life in taverns,
claiming to be a hero.

26:08.328 --> 26:11.343
I know the real thing when I see it.

26:11.344 --> 26:16.323
That's why I follow him
on these ridiculous missions...

26:16.324 --> 26:18.388
in the hope I'll become the man
I pretend to be.

26:22.368 --> 26:24.351
Why do YOU follow him?

26:24.352 --> 26:27.395
That would seem an entirely
illogical thing to do.

26:27.396 --> 26:29.352
The truth is...

26:30.364 --> 26:34.320
..you and Jason are the only
real family I have.

26:37.328 --> 26:38.376
I love you...

26:39.392 --> 26:41.328
..both of you.

26:42.384 --> 26:45.399
And, for a rational man,
it leaves me utterly bewildered,

26:45.400 --> 26:47.388
but there it is. I do it for love.

26:52.312 --> 26:53.347
Are you crying?

26:53.348 --> 26:57.351
Crying? Don't be ridiculous.
Got some ash... in my eye.

26:57.352 --> 27:00.347
No... you have tears
in both of your eyes...

27:00.348 --> 27:02.351
Are you going to keep me
awake talking all night,

27:02.352 --> 27:04.380
or are you going to let me
get some sleep?

27:09.344 --> 27:12.319
The prisoner was found
dead in his cell.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.403
It seems the guards
were too forceful.

27:13.404 --> 27:15.387
Did he reveal
anything before he died?

27:15.388 --> 27:17.335
Very little.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.339
There's something you're
not telling me.

27:19.340 --> 27:23.315
He told the men the Palladium
is no longer within the city.

27:23.316 --> 27:25.323
Your soldiers are loyal,

27:25.324 --> 27:27.403
but I don't believe
they will keep this to themselves.

27:27.404 --> 27:30.388
It can only be a matter of time
before word of this spreads.

27:44.312 --> 27:45.371
If Dion's right, the Colchian army

27:45.372 --> 27:48.324
should be camped on the other side
of those mountains.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.379
There's thousands of them.

27:59.380 --> 28:01.315
Tens of thousands.

28:01.316 --> 28:04.363
And somewhere amongst them
is the Palladium.

28:04.364 --> 28:08.347
I would say our chances of success
are slim to... nonexistent.

28:08.348 --> 28:11.348
Really? As high as that?

28:12.408 --> 28:17.340
I always say, it's never too late
to turn and flee like cowards.

28:20.376 --> 28:22.368
We'll go in under
the cover of darkness.

29:16.348 --> 29:18.312
Agh!

29:28.336 --> 29:29.340
There.

29:41.408 --> 29:43.335
Right...

29:43.336 --> 29:46.315
Pasiphae won't allow the
Palladium far from her sight.

29:46.316 --> 29:47.340
It must be in her tent.

29:58.384 --> 29:59.403
Good evening.

29:59.404 --> 30:01.348
Agh! Ugh...

30:02.388 --> 30:03.392
Keep watch.

30:53.372 --> 30:54.383
Argh...

30:54.384 --> 30:56.336
Pythagoras!

30:59.324 --> 31:00.328
Let's go.

31:08.368 --> 31:09.384
Seize them!

31:28.360 --> 31:29.396
I think we've lost them.

31:32.352 --> 31:33.384
Go! I'll catch you up.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.352
We'll never make it past them.

31:46.392 --> 31:48.352
We might make it over them.

31:50.364 --> 31:51.371
Come on.

31:51.372 --> 31:52.391
Where are we going?

31:52.392 --> 31:54.367
Apparently we're going over them.

31:54.368 --> 31:56.351
Over them?

31:56.352 --> 32:00.380
We might as well fall on our swords,
because this is suicide.

32:13.316 --> 32:15.315
Well, that really was
rather exhilarating.

32:15.316 --> 32:16.399
Is that what you call it?!

32:16.400 --> 32:18.360
They won't be far behind us.

32:30.344 --> 32:32.355
We'll never outrun them on foot.

32:32.356 --> 32:33.387
Head for the rocks.

32:33.388 --> 32:35.396
The paths will be too
steep for their horses.

32:50.340 --> 32:52.380
Pantheras. Take your men on ahead.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.312
Yah! Come on!

33:13.404 --> 33:15.368
Argh!

33:41.360 --> 33:43.520
The others won't be far behind.
We have to keep moving.

33:47.324 --> 33:49.316
No! Jason!

33:51.336 --> 33:52.356
You!

33:53.376 --> 33:54.387
Yah!

33:54.388 --> 33:55.392
Ngh...

33:59.400 --> 34:02.311
I said. I said we should never
have let him go,

34:02.312 --> 34:04.319
but nobody listens
and this is the result.

34:04.320 --> 34:06.331
Hercules.

34:06.332 --> 34:08.347
How... How bad is it?

34:08.348 --> 34:10.355
I can't tell
until I remove the arrow.

34:10.356 --> 34:12.335
I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

34:16.368 --> 34:18.399
How does it... How does it look?

34:18.400 --> 34:20.342
I need to dress it.

34:20.344 --> 34:21.382
No, no.

34:21.384 --> 34:24.315
There's no time.
Just take the Palladium and go.

34:24.315 --> 34:25.319
We're not leaving.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.384
No, I promised Ariadne.

34:28.356 --> 34:30.382
I would rather die than fail her.

34:30.384 --> 34:33.344
I won't let you die
and that's an end to it.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.395
He's losing too much blood.

34:47.396 --> 34:49.375
I need to pack the wound
more tightly.

34:49.376 --> 34:51.339
You're right. This is hopeless.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.391
We'll never outrun them.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.367
There. That cave.

34:54.368 --> 34:56.362
If we can make
it inside without being seen,

34:56.364 --> 34:57.384
they might pass us by.

35:00.388 --> 35:01.404
Ugh...

35:26.364 --> 35:28.340
It seems our luck has run out.

35:29.376 --> 35:31.324
Not necessarily...

35:44.324 --> 35:45.399
I just hope it's strong enough.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.400
There's only one way to find out.

36:06.352 --> 36:08.383
Whatever you do, don't look down.

36:08.384 --> 36:09.403
Oh, no...

36:09.404 --> 36:11.315
What?

36:11.316 --> 36:12.328
I just looked down.

36:49.312 --> 36:50.348
More!

37:05.328 --> 37:06.448
We have to see to his wound.

37:15.380 --> 37:18.375
They have taken shelter in the cave.
They are trapped.

37:18.376 --> 37:20.372
We shall make certain of it.

37:26.340 --> 37:27.364
Gaia thea...

37:39.340 --> 37:40.364
Send word to the camp.

37:42.328 --> 37:43.352
We march on Atlantis.

37:52.356 --> 37:54.380
Well, we're not getting out that way.

37:56.368 --> 37:57.372
How is he?

37:58.384 --> 38:00.323
We have to stop the bleeding.

38:00.324 --> 38:02.348
See if you can find some wood
to build a fire.

38:12.348 --> 38:15.323
Dion? What news?

38:15.324 --> 38:17.395
The Colchian army has crossed
the river at Nestos.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.328
They will reach
the city by nightfall.

38:22.368 --> 38:23.396
Thank you, Dion.

38:35.328 --> 38:37.311
I've stopped the bleeding for now.

38:37.312 --> 38:39.332
Then we need to find a way
out of here.

38:50.372 --> 38:52.315
What was that?

38:52.316 --> 38:53.400
I'm sure it's just bats.

38:55.408 --> 38:57.344
I hate bats.

39:17.368 --> 39:21.312
The Generals believe the Colchians
number over 40,000.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.367
Without the Palladium,
I fear the city will fall.

39:24.368 --> 39:26.347
You believe I should surrender?

39:26.348 --> 39:28.343
Pasiphae is not a barbarian.

39:28.344 --> 39:31.375
She will offer safe passage for
yourself and other members of court.

39:31.376 --> 39:33.375
You believe it is my life
I fear for?

39:33.376 --> 39:37.347
How many would die under
Pasiphae's rule?

39:37.348 --> 39:40.315
I will not leave my people to suffer
under her tyranny.

39:40.316 --> 39:42.343
The soldiers know
the Palladium has gone.

39:42.344 --> 39:44.315
They are fleeing in their droves.

39:44.316 --> 39:47.316
As long as there are soldiers left,
I will stand with them.

39:48.408 --> 39:50.376
I still have faith in Jason.

40:00.328 --> 40:02.340
They were caught deserting the city.

40:04.384 --> 40:06.343
Tell me.

40:06.344 --> 40:07.376
Why are you deserting?

40:11.348 --> 40:13.407
Perhaps you have lost
faith in your new queen?

40:13.408 --> 40:15.335
No!

40:15.336 --> 40:19.311
A loyal soldier does not
flee on the eve of battle.

40:19.312 --> 40:21.315
Atlantis is doomed.

40:21.316 --> 40:22.396
Why would you believe that?

40:28.352 --> 40:30.323
The truth...

40:30.324 --> 40:32.392
and your life will be spared.
You have my word.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.347
The Palladium was stolen.

40:36.348 --> 40:37.375
Without it...

40:37.376 --> 40:39.328
Atlantis will fall.

40:40.340 --> 40:41.392
The Gods have spoken.

40:43.408 --> 40:45.403
Release them.

40:45.404 --> 40:47.399
Let it be known
there will be safe passage

40:47.400 --> 40:49.364
for all of those who wish to follow.

40:55.396 --> 40:57.388
Lord Sarpedon has served us well.

40:59.380 --> 41:01.375
Ready the men.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.388
We attack tonight.

41:04.368 --> 41:07.375
Agh, this is hopeless.
The tunnels go on for miles.

41:07.376 --> 41:09.387
The Colchian army will be
marching on Atlantis.

41:09.388 --> 41:10.400
We have to go on.

41:14.356 --> 41:15.516
That doesn't sound like bats.

41:42.336 --> 41:44.367
I have dreamt of the day
I would retake the throne...

41:44.368 --> 41:45.391
Heave!

41:45.392 --> 41:47.364
..and now it has finally come.

41:56.324 --> 41:57.347
Perhaps we lost it.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.388
Or perhaps it found us.

41:58.413 --> 42:00.413
