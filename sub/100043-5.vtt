WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:04.171
No, Margaret, I want you to triple-check

00:04.171 --> 00:06.006
with the compliance officer about that.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.258
- What're you doing?
- I'm working on a little something.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.136
You know how when you're making pancakes,
your hands are always full?

00:11.220 --> 00:12.804
- No.
- Well, this will solve that.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.100
Did you take the batteries out
of the smoke detector for this?

00:17.768 --> 00:19.144
No, no, still here, still here.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.396
Yeah, no, I want to read
the investor statement this afternoon,

00:21.480 --> 00:22.940
but, Dom, you're gonna have to resend it.

00:22.940 --> 00:26.235
You accidentally emailed me
the first chapter of your novel,

00:26.235 --> 00:30.364
and just a tiny little note,
maybe not all bosoms are heaving.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.949
Thanks, guys.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.035
Work call on a Saturday morning,
what's going on?

00:36.245 --> 00:39.164
Honey. You probably don't want
to get into this right now,

00:39.248 --> 00:41.542
but is this a bald spot
or the center of your swirl?

00:43.293 --> 00:45.629
My job has been miserable.

00:45.629 --> 00:48.048
I'm always working, I never sleep.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.259
And all I do is clean up
other people's messes,

00:50.259 --> 00:53.136
because I'm the only adult in the room.

00:53.220 --> 00:57.432
Oh, my God. I'm a mom again,
but to people I don't love.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.269
Sweetheart, listen, for years,
you've supported me,

01:00.269 --> 01:03.063
while I juggled realtoring and juggling.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.815
Now, it's my turn to support you.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.276
Anything that's not work, I'm your guy.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.360
Oh, God!

01:20.873 --> 01:23.917
Hey, look at you guys,
so playful.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.420
When I get married,
I hope my wife and I never lose

01:26.420 --> 01:27.588
that sense of whimsy.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.714
- Thank you, Luke.
- What do you want?

01:28.714 --> 01:30.048
Okay, here's the deal.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.258
My buddy Scooter and I came up

01:31.258 --> 01:32.968
with this really cool business idea.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.554
- We think it's gonna be huge.
- That's great, pal.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.848
We are so proud of you.
Get to the bad part.

01:37.848 --> 01:41.518
There is no bad part.
Actually, you guys are gonna make money,

01:41.602 --> 01:43.187
because I have to drop out
of school to do it.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.813
You're not dropping out of school.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.940
- Honey, I got this.
- No.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.735
But we should've seen it coming,
after all, his dad is the creator

01:49.735 --> 01:52.404
of the "Hey, Batter, Batter."

01:52.404 --> 01:53.655
The name's a place holder.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.032
But probably still available.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.576
Dad, I want you to know
I love your pancake shooter.

01:57.576 --> 02:01.872
Have you seen the updates to...

02:03.165 --> 02:04.708
...the Insta-Cold straw?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.335
You should be on a stamp.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.712
Has that ever not electrocuted someone?

02:08.712 --> 02:12.216
Sometimes, you have to shock a few
people before you shock the world.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.051
That should go on your stamp.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.928
Okay, stop flattering your dad.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.137
You're not dropping out of school.

02:17.221 --> 02:20.224
You're almost done, and more importantly,

02:20.224 --> 02:21.725
we don't quit things in this family.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.770
Haley quit college,
and Alex quit her job in Antarctica,

02:24.770 --> 02:27.231
and Dad has never finished a sudoku.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.398
They are hard.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.110
Mom, this isn't some goof.
Scooter and I really believe in this idea.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.780
Can we at least show you
the investor presentation this afternoon?

02:34.780 --> 02:38.158
- We'd love to hear it, wouldn't we?
- Of course.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.285
Yes! You guys aren't
gonna be disappointed.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.828
I'm gonna call Scooter now.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.665
He's not dropping out of school.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.042
You have got to listen with an open mind.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.961
After all, what kind of world
would we live in,

02:48.961 --> 02:50.546
if all parents forced
their kids to stay in school

02:50.546 --> 02:51.755
and not pursue their dreams?

02:51.839 --> 02:54.424
No Steve Jobs. No Mark Zuckerberg,

02:54.508 --> 02:55.551
no Cindy Crawford...

02:55.551 --> 02:58.554
Steve Jobs put a computer
in everyone's pocket.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.889
Luke almost died taking off
a hoodie on an escalator.

03:00.973 --> 03:03.684
My point is, dreams need to be fostered.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.227
And If I'm being honest,

03:05.227 --> 03:08.188
I kind of love the idea of being
a mentor to these two young minds.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.235
Wooden spoon!
Knock it away with a wooden spoon!

03:13.235 --> 03:14.319
Thank you.

03:16.405 --> 03:19.074
Oh, this is amazing.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.200
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

03:20.284 --> 03:21.618
Daddy so walks like that.

03:22.828 --> 03:23.871
Why are you guys laughing?

03:25.122 --> 03:27.374
- We were happy.
- Since when?

03:27.374 --> 03:28.876
Were you watching that video again?

03:28.876 --> 03:32.462
Recently, the high school
dolphin mascot has been mocking Cam

03:32.546 --> 03:33.714
during football games.

03:33.714 --> 03:37.217
He's, and I don't use
this word lightly, a genius.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.803
How about
we get out heads in the game!

03:45.392 --> 03:46.602
Rick, you're gonna be streaking through,

03:46.602 --> 03:48.896
so it's gonna be boom-boom, you got it?

03:50.314 --> 03:53.692
I'm surprised you can't see
the humor in what the mascot is doing.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.235
Isn't it a lot like clowning?

03:55.319 --> 03:57.154
- What did you just say?
- Are you insane?

03:57.154 --> 03:59.239
Mascotting is nothing like clowning.

03:59.323 --> 04:01.825
Clowns are descendants
of the court jester.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.827
Truth-teller to the king.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.121
Mascots know nothing
of veritas and beauty.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.248
Don't you just make weiner dogs
out of balloons?

04:08.332 --> 04:10.584
You are just jealous
because no kid ever said,

04:10.584 --> 04:13.795
"Hey, Mom, this year,
for my birthday, can we get a narc?"

04:13.879 --> 04:16.006
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I'm just stressed out.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.133
This mascot is under my skin.

04:18.217 --> 04:20.344
I can't have him making me
look like a fool today.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.472
I just found out a recruiter from
the University of North Central Missouri

04:23.472 --> 04:25.182
is coming to watch me coach.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.101
A recruiter?
Did you apply for a job in Missouri?

04:28.185 --> 04:29.394
I just said I was available.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.104
Without consulting me.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.397
You always said you were okay

04:32.481 --> 04:34.024
with moving back
to Missouri at some point,

04:34.024 --> 04:36.318
turning our little family into a farmily.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.487
- You know I hate that word.
- Why? It's descriptive and fun.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.155
And you know what?
Look, if I got this job,

04:40.239 --> 04:42.324
I would be the first openly gay

04:42.324 --> 04:43.825
college football coach in history,

04:43.909 --> 04:45.202
and I would think...

04:45.661 --> 04:46.662
You'd support that.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.790
And I would think
that you would ask me before uprooting

04:49.790 --> 04:51.208
our whole farmily to...

04:52.334 --> 04:53.836
Damn it, it's in there now.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.715
- Hi!
- Hi.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.759
Hello, <i>mes ninos.</i>

05:00.843 --> 05:03.262
Thank you so much for watching
the babies for a few hours.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.222
If you have trouble telling them apart,

05:05.222 --> 05:06.390
just take off their diapers.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.975
I wrote George's name inside his.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.685
There's my great-grandchildren.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.019
Do they recognize faces?

05:11.103 --> 05:12.479
Do I need to start slipping them cash

05:12.563 --> 05:13.939
to let them know who's in charge?

05:13.939 --> 05:16.275
Grandpa, you don't need to buy their love.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.068
Buy mine, and I'll talk you up.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.320
Are we babysitting? Should I cancel golf?

05:20.404 --> 05:23.031
No, I know how important
it is for you and your friends to complain

05:23.115 --> 05:25.701
about how young people today

05:25.701 --> 05:27.578
are slightly different
than your generation.

05:27.578 --> 05:31.164
Vin Diesel is just Telly Savalas
without the lollipop,

05:31.248 --> 05:32.708
and a great catch phrase.

05:32.833 --> 05:37.546
Huh. Okay, you two, I know how
precious alone time is for new parents,

05:37.546 --> 05:39.214
so, everybody, go.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.717
Have a great afternoon.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.802
Okay, <i>mes ninos,</i> Gloria has planned

05:43.886 --> 05:46.471
a very exciting afternoon for you.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.557
Let's see.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.853
Who is ready to reject Satan

05:52.853 --> 05:56.440
and all his empty promises?

05:56.440 --> 05:59.568
Today, I'm having
the babies secretly baptized,

05:59.568 --> 06:02.571
both into Catholicism
and into the crazy things

06:02.571 --> 06:04.281
we do to each other in this family.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.451
Absolutely not.

06:08.994 --> 06:12.414
Be reasonable, Tashi,
tonight's a big game for me.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.751
I need to project authority,
and your antics undermine me.

06:15.751 --> 06:19.087
Well, buckle up, Coach,
'cause I'm taking it up a giant notch

06:19.171 --> 06:20.964
and taping today's game
for my college apps.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.466
Okay, you're gonna get into college.

06:22.466 --> 06:23.926
You have fantastic grades.

06:23.926 --> 06:27.346
Oh, you're right, an Asian kid
with great grades! That's fresh!

06:27.346 --> 06:30.349
I need to guarantee a spot.
Mascotting sets me apart.

06:30.349 --> 06:33.018
Listen, you little punk,
I could suspend you.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.063
How would your fancy colleges
like to see that on your record, huh?

06:36.605 --> 06:38.565
Nice try, but, uh, my free expression

06:38.649 --> 06:39.983
is protected by the Supreme Court ruling

06:40.067 --> 06:41.735
in <i>North Dakota v. Bandito.</i>

06:42.110 --> 06:47.324
You half-time hacks,
no scruples, no honor.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.785
Is this a clown thing again?

06:49.785 --> 06:51.620
We clowns have more humanity

06:51.620 --> 06:55.082
in one of our whimsically
oversized pinkies,

06:55.082 --> 06:58.210
more than you do
in your entire stinky costume.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.798
You powder-faced elitists
looking down your red noses at everybody.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.676
Wipe the pie out of your eyes.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.261
The revolution is coming!

07:09.888 --> 07:13.141
Do we really need
to do this on a Saturday?

07:13.225 --> 07:14.309
I'm sorry.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.395
Nick was supposed to sign these
before he left for Fiji...

07:16.395 --> 07:18.981
- Mmm.
- ...and people need to get paid.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.150
We don't all live in mansions.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.194
This is hardly a mansion, Margaret.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.364
Oh, why are we writing
a huge check to a shaman?

07:27.364 --> 07:30.367
Oh, Nick took the interns
on a vision quest.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.119
Well, the female ones.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.620
- Gross.
- Mmm.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.290
Hey, guys, Scooter's here. Great.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.917
Can't wait to hear this amazing idea.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.627
Hang on, hang on.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.796
Can we just remember
we're on the same team

07:42.880 --> 07:43.922
and Luke can't drop out of school,

07:44.006 --> 07:45.382
so please don't make me
the bad guy.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.718
Honey, they're kids.
I don't want to crush their spirit.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.887
They're just looking
for a little guidance.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.264
Yeah, we're gonna guide 'em
right back into college.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.932
Margaret, this is gonna take
a few minutes.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.559
Do you mind hanging here
while we're in the living room?

07:55.559 --> 07:59.021
I'll just wait here,
in this other living room.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.898
My God, the waste.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.610
- Hey!
- Uh, Mom, Dad, this is Scooter Rivael.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.987
Phil, Claire, nice to meet you.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.906
- Hi.
- Luke's said such wonderful things.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.074
Wait, uh, you're Scooter?

08:11.158 --> 08:12.451
I was expecting someone younger,

08:12.451 --> 08:15.162
maybe wearing Heelys and a backpack.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.581
Uh, well, my real name's Scott,

08:17.581 --> 08:19.374
but Luke and I met at the club,

08:19.458 --> 08:22.294
- where everyone calls me Scooter.
- Or worse.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.587
Hey!

08:23.587 --> 08:26.298
- So, let's hear this big idea, huh?
- Okay.

08:26.298 --> 08:29.092
- Well, just like we rehearsed it.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.344
You got this, buddy.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.095
Mmm.

08:32.471 --> 08:34.598
Remember when I took
night time medicine in the daytime

08:34.598 --> 08:36.141
and fell down the stairs?

08:36.225 --> 08:39.186
Remember? I bent all
your fingers back into their sockets.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.230
Well, I had to go
to three different doctors.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.690
And every one of them
made me fill out the same forms.

08:43.774 --> 08:47.194
Introducing Form Filler Med,
a secure, encrypted mobile app

08:47.194 --> 08:50.030
that transfers your medical
and insurance info to your doctor's office

08:50.030 --> 08:51.156
with a tap of your phone.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.618
No more filling out the same boring forms,
over and over again.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.412
I ran the idea by a couple of old guys
at the club and they loved it.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.997
Yeah, and we weren't even drunk yet.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.253
Alcoholism kills millions of people a day.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.632
I know what you're thinking.
"Will doctors go for this?"

09:08.632 --> 09:11.343
We polled over 200 doctors
and medical personnel,

09:11.343 --> 09:14.096
and 93% said
that they would happily pay

09:14.096 --> 09:16.640
our monthly fee to reduce
their administrative load.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.935
But don't, uh, doctors' offices all use,
like, different systems?

09:19.935 --> 09:21.395
Great question, Claire.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.773
The top two medical software systems
have 90% market share,

09:24.857 --> 09:25.941
and we're compatible with both.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.985
Wow! And, uh, what do you do, Scooter?

09:27.985 --> 09:29.611
Other than befriend children, I mean.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.280
I'm a venture capitalist.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.992
I've invested in 22 companies
over the last 30 years,

09:34.992 --> 09:36.243
and personally, led three of them

09:36.243 --> 09:37.911
from initial concept through IPO.

09:37.995 --> 09:40.330
Fascinating. You ever thought
about starting a business with,

09:40.414 --> 09:42.457
uh, I don't know, your own son?

09:45.043 --> 09:47.671
Okay, let me show you the device itself.

09:49.173 --> 09:53.135
All the doctor's office
has to do is plug this into the USB slot

09:53.135 --> 09:54.678
of their reception room computer.

09:56.305 --> 10:00.017
A patient opens the app on their phone,
and taps it against the device,

10:00.017 --> 10:02.144
and just like that,

10:02.144 --> 10:05.272
all of your encrypted and pertinent
medical and insurance information

10:05.272 --> 10:07.065
is instantly in your doctor's database.

10:07.149 --> 10:11.028
Well, I'm so sorry, guys,
but I like filling out medical forms,

10:11.028 --> 10:13.530
and I think there are millions
of hardworking Americans just like me,

10:13.614 --> 10:15.449
so this shark is out.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.784
- Uh, Mom?
- Oh, good luck with that one.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.119
She's a lot tougher than me.

10:19.203 --> 10:21.872
Oh, it brings me
absolutely no joy to say this.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.498
Luke, I'm impressed.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.584
- But...
- But nothing.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.504
Do you have any idea how much
I hate filling out those medical forms?

10:28.504 --> 10:30.714
It seems like you have
really done your homework,

10:30.714 --> 10:34.176
and most importantly,
you have a great partner here.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.929
- I say, go for it.
- Seriously?

10:36.929 --> 10:38.222
Mmm-hmm.
Psst.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.806
Claire, um, I have Nick

10:39.890 --> 10:41.099
on the phone from Fiji.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.351
We're in the middle
of something, Margaret.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.019
He says it's an emergency.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.145
Ugh!

10:45.312 --> 10:48.065
He's on my phone.
Uh, it's in the solarium.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.358
It's a bay window, Margaret.

10:49.358 --> 10:52.236
We did it, buddy.
Oh! Hold on.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.362
It's not settled yet.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.863
Well, I thought we heard a yes.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.241
No, I'm still having
a conversation with my wife.

10:57.241 --> 10:59.159
Please, make yourself comfortable.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.286
Maybe kick off those rubber-soled shoes,

11:01.370 --> 11:03.914
while I grab you
an instantly cold beverage.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.166
"I'm just your husband."
"Oh, your husband."

11:06.250 --> 11:07.501
"You're gossiping. That's what I do."

11:07.501 --> 11:09.378
Looks like someone had a fight.

11:09.378 --> 11:13.090
Hey, Mrs. Pasternack,
um, was it that obvious?

11:13.090 --> 11:17.469
Yeah. I say that to everyone.
More often than not, I'm right. Martini?

11:17.553 --> 11:19.930
- No, thanks, I'm good.
- No, you're not.

11:20.097 --> 11:23.016
- Marriage is hard.
- I know.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.936
Everyone's always trying
to change each other.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.272
It's like I'm an adult film director

11:28.272 --> 11:31.233
who collects Precious Moments dolls.
Let me be me!

11:32.609 --> 11:33.610
So, what's up with you two?

11:33.694 --> 11:38.115
Uh, Cam started looking for a job
out-of-state without consulting me.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.409
Don't worry, you'll meet someone else.

11:40.409 --> 11:41.702
No, he wants me to go with him.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.954
Ah! That's the Cam I know.

11:43.954 --> 11:47.082
- He's always going on about you.
- He is?

11:47.082 --> 11:50.836
Haven't you ever seen his Facebook page?
He's obsessed with you.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.548
"How gorgeous does Mitchell
look in this picture?"

11:54.548 --> 11:57.968
Aw! "Proud to be married
to a man who fights for justice."

11:58.302 --> 12:02.055
Aw! "Mitchell over his cold.
Hope my hubby brings the love tonight."

12:02.764 --> 12:04.558
Ew! My dad liked that. Bleh.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.186
All right, Lily, I'm on my way
to the game. How bad is it?

12:07.186 --> 12:09.271
<i>The dolphin is eviscerating Dad.</i>

12:13.108 --> 12:15.444
If it was me,
he would totally do something.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.446
But what? Ugh! Just give me a sign!

12:21.491 --> 12:23.994
Is there any way
I could just throw money at it?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.584
Welcome, Father.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.961
Come in,
I've been waiting for you for hours.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.506
I came as fast as I could.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.803
<i>Except for Father Ramirez,</i>

12:41.887 --> 12:43.055
<i>all the priests I asked</i>

12:43.055 --> 12:46.975
were "uncomfortable"
with my secret baptism.

12:47.059 --> 12:50.437
They said it was "borderline kidnapping."

12:50.521 --> 12:52.981
That they found my trickery "devilish."

12:53.482 --> 12:57.611
It's like, when did Catholics
become so judgmental?

12:57.611 --> 13:00.614
Your twins are beautiful.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.866
Yes, these are my babies

13:02.950 --> 13:05.035
that I, their mother, want to baptize.

13:05.410 --> 13:09.206
Why don't we start now
with the holy water, Father.

13:09.206 --> 13:15.921
No, traditionally, baptism is always
preceded by a full mass, dear.

13:16.171 --> 13:19.174
But it is almost Happy Hour.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.427
Good, good, good.

13:23.178 --> 13:26.682
I baptize you, in the name of the Father,

13:26.682 --> 13:29.810
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.314
Why do you sound surprised?
You cut my brakes or something?

13:36.024 --> 13:37.568
What the hell's a priest doing here?

13:37.568 --> 13:39.528
Oh, it's just a checkup.

13:39.528 --> 13:42.823
One of the babies maybe is possessed.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.283
Wait, are you baptizing them

13:44.283 --> 13:46.285
behind Haley and what's-his-name's back?

13:46.285 --> 13:48.328
You can't do that to other people's kids.

13:48.412 --> 13:50.539
It's not a big deal if it works.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.208
The babies are protected,
their souls are safe,

13:53.292 --> 13:55.210
and they're gonna
spend eternity in heaven.

13:55.294 --> 13:58.088
If it doesn't, it's just like
I gave them a little bath.

13:58.172 --> 14:02.718
Gloria,
who is this grumpy old man?

14:02.718 --> 14:05.179
<i>-"Viejo,"</i> I know that word.
- Huh?

14:05.179 --> 14:07.055
Did Father Time here just call me old?

14:07.181 --> 14:10.350
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's introduce the babies

14:10.434 --> 14:13.437
to the one true God,
then we'll have some coffee cake.

14:13.437 --> 14:14.897
You know you're crossing a line here.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.357
Haley and Dylan doesn't even have to know.

14:17.441 --> 14:18.901
Know what?

14:19.276 --> 14:20.694
Why is there a priest here?

14:20.819 --> 14:24.698
I told you, Poppy's possessed.
Everybody can see it but you.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.535
Why didn't you just ask us?

14:29.077 --> 14:31.580
Father, forgive me, but I have to sin.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.124
I did.
I did ask you, you said yes.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.459
I think you were very drunk.

14:35.792 --> 14:39.379
Haley, New-Phil,
do you really want this baptism?

14:40.005 --> 14:42.633
I don't know.
We've barely thought about it.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.677
Dylan did say that he was going
to research some religions.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.388
I'm halfway through
this Jim Jones documentary,

14:48.472 --> 14:50.307
so far, that religion seems pretty cool.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.142
I'm sorry that I didn't ask you before.

14:52.226 --> 14:55.437
I really wanted to do this
for George and Poppy.

14:55.521 --> 14:57.648
Baptism is going to allow

14:57.648 --> 14:59.900
their souls to find eternal peace.

14:59.900 --> 15:00.984
What's the catch?

15:01.068 --> 15:04.530
Well, there's a lot
of donations and some shame around sex,

15:04.530 --> 15:05.906
but Christmas is fun.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.617
I don't even know how I can decide

15:09.409 --> 15:10.619
but I guess it can't hurt.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.081
You're going to the kingdom of heaven.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.291
And there, you're going to join

15:16.375 --> 15:18.377
the souls of some of our greats,

15:18.377 --> 15:20.963
like Joan of Arc, Mother Teresa,

15:20.963 --> 15:23.215
Danny DeVito when he dies.

15:25.717 --> 15:30.097
I baptize you in the name
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy...

15:30.097 --> 15:32.140
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What now?

15:32.266 --> 15:35.143
I'm sorry, it just,
it suddenly just got very real,

15:35.227 --> 15:36.562
and it does not feel right to,

15:36.562 --> 15:38.230
and I don't know why.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.982
Grandpa, am I making too much of this?

15:39.982 --> 15:42.776
Don't ask him because
he doesn't even believe in God.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.154
I just don't think you need church,
costumes, all that stuff,

15:46.238 --> 15:47.948
to feel a higher power.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.700
But you think there is one?

15:50.075 --> 15:51.451
Yeah, I felt it when my kids were born,

15:51.535 --> 15:53.704
and, uh, when I met
this crazy woman here

15:53.704 --> 15:55.539
that I want to spend
the rest of my life with,

15:55.664 --> 15:58.000
but, you know, it can be just
a normal everyday thing, too.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.459
You know,
like the way it makes me feel

15:59.543 --> 16:02.337
when I hear
a baseball thump into a mitt...

16:02.880 --> 16:07.843
or the way Tom Waits' voice can somehow
be ugly and beautiful at the same time.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.261
Am I making any sense?

16:09.970 --> 16:12.639
You know, last year,
Dylan and I went to Yosemite,

16:12.806 --> 16:14.766
and we woke up
really early one morning,

16:14.850 --> 16:17.728
and it was just us
and those gorgeous mountains,

16:17.728 --> 16:21.023
a bunch of huge trees
and a family of deer.

16:22.316 --> 16:23.734
It was so beautiful.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.111
It made me feel like I was connected

16:26.195 --> 16:28.530
to something bigger than myself.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.575
Maybe one day,
we can get them baptized in a church,

16:31.575 --> 16:35.704
but, for now,
why don't we take them up to Yosemite

16:35.704 --> 16:38.540
and look up and say thank you.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.127
That sounds like a great plan, Haley.

16:42.211 --> 16:45.464
Yeah. And maybe roast
some marshmallows while you're there,

16:45.464 --> 16:48.258
so that they get used
to being around fire.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.427
No, Nick, you can't keep
taking money from marketing.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.179
They need... What?

16:52.888 --> 16:54.640
No, I will not stay on the phone

16:54.640 --> 16:56.183
while you moon a cruise ship.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.476
Are you... Claire.

16:57.476 --> 16:58.977
- Hang on. What?
- Claire.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.145
What was that out there?

17:00.229 --> 17:01.813
I thought we were supposed
to be on the same team.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.483
We are. I... They've got a great idea.

17:04.483 --> 17:07.110
You're just jealous because
Luke went to Scooter and not to you.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.862
That is not true.

17:08.946 --> 17:10.531
Really? You don't think
they're onto something?

17:10.906 --> 17:12.491
It's an amazing idea...

17:13.408 --> 17:14.618
But why didn't he come to me?

17:14.618 --> 17:16.954
Because you love everything I do.

17:17.246 --> 17:19.456
I wanted to make sure
this was actually a good idea.

17:19.540 --> 17:23.085
That is so smart.
How is someone this handsome...

17:23.085 --> 17:25.587
Okay, this is what I'm talking about.

17:25.671 --> 17:28.549
I love inventing with you,
but this is a business.

17:28.549 --> 17:30.551
And Scooter has a lot of experience.

17:30.676 --> 17:33.512
That doesn't take away from all the things
that we've made together.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.347
All that stuff brought me here.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.350
- Really?
- You can't spell Form Filler without Phil.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.018
But you know you can, right?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.812
The man's hurting.
I'm throwing him a bone.

17:41.812 --> 17:43.647
I'm proud of you, Luke.

17:43.814 --> 17:45.983
Damn it, I'm proud of Scooter, too.

17:46.942 --> 17:47.943
Wow.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.404
You know, seeing you guys' pitch,

17:50.404 --> 17:52.614
and the passion,

17:53.323 --> 17:56.368
that sparkle in your eye,
I don't remember

17:57.160 --> 17:59.705
the last time I saw you care
about anything that much.

18:01.415 --> 18:04.042
- I don't remember the last time I did.
- That's super hurtful.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.503
No, sweetie, I'm talking about work.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.797
Honestly, I used to get up in the morning,

18:08.881 --> 18:11.258
and I couldn't wait to get to the office.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.177
And now I dread it.

18:13.886 --> 18:18.724
I do. I miss loving my job.
Or even liking it.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.769
Now, all I do is put out fires
and manage complaints,

18:22.853 --> 18:27.900
and lose sleep over stuff
that really doesn't matter.

18:30.068 --> 18:33.488
Yeah. I think I'm gonna quit my job.

18:34.573 --> 18:35.657
Are you serious?

18:36.241 --> 18:39.203
Yeah. Is that crazy?

18:39.494 --> 18:42.664
Uh, no. Not necessarily.

18:42.748 --> 18:44.249
I mean,
crazy is sticking with something

18:44.333 --> 18:46.627
that's been
making you miserable for months,

18:46.627 --> 18:48.045
when there are so many companies out there

18:48.045 --> 18:50.172
who would want somebody with your skills.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.466
Hey, Nick, you still there?

18:52.674 --> 18:55.135
I told my son this morning
that he should never quit.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.055
Well, I was wrong. I'm out.

19:01.225 --> 19:05.020
That felt so good.
It was so scary, but it was so good.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.814
- I'm so proud of you, too.
- Oh!

19:07.898 --> 19:11.109
Hear, hear, to our next adventure.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.320
Oh, I found this in the wine cellar.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.239
It's a basement, Margaret.

19:15.364 --> 19:18.575
No, close the gap! Ball, ball, ball!

19:18.825 --> 19:21.286
Oh, God!

19:21.495 --> 19:22.913
<i>It was a nightmare.</i>

19:22.913 --> 19:26.458
The biggest opportunity of my career,
and I couldn't focus.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.919
<i>I tried not to make
any mockable movements.</i>

19:29.962 --> 19:32.756
<i>David Tashi was just operating
at too high a level.</i>

19:33.340 --> 19:35.259
<i>But then, something wonderful happened.</i>

19:38.011 --> 19:39.346
Ooh! Ow!

19:40.514 --> 19:41.598
They love me.

19:42.558 --> 19:45.143
<i>That's when I realized,
I knew that chicken.</i>

19:45.227 --> 19:48.897
<i>Those weak punches, a run that said,
"Pick me last" in gym class.</i>

19:48.981 --> 19:50.274
<i>It was my Mitchell.</i>

19:50.274 --> 19:51.525
Okay, guys, come on, let's huddle up.
Huddle up.

19:52.693 --> 19:53.777
Let's get out there
and play our hearts out.

19:53.861 --> 19:55.737
Let's go. Bring it in.

19:55.821 --> 19:58.532
Pitkowski, come on, something
more interesting going on over there?

19:58.532 --> 20:01.702
Yeah. Does anybody else
see the dolphin fighting the chicken?

20:01.702 --> 20:03.453
'Cause I got hit pretty hard
on the head earlier.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.957
All right, let's go.
All right, so this is what we're gonna do.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.626
You're gonna go up, right,
you're gonna be coming up this way.

20:09.710 --> 20:10.919
When he comes right through here,

20:11.003 --> 20:12.296
you're gonna hit him
right in the middle...

20:15.299 --> 20:17.926
- Where's Daddy?
- He went to go return the chicken costume.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.804
That was, like, two hours ago.
You don't think...

20:22.723 --> 20:25.809
Okay, Mitchell,
is that you in the mascot costume?

20:28.520 --> 20:30.480
Is someone forcing you to do that?

20:31.273 --> 20:33.275
Okay, then get in the car now.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.111
I stayed in California.
I married outside of my religion.

20:36.195 --> 20:38.947
I spend every waking moment
with your family.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.158
But my love is not unconditional.

20:43.368 --> 20:44.786
Okay. All right.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.831
I love it when they honk for me.
