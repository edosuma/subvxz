00:26.093 --> 00:27.729
Hey, everyone,
it's Bobby Leiber,

00:27.762 --> 00:29.597
and welcome to
your favorite podcast,

00:29.631 --> 00:31.431
<i>The 11th Brick at Stonewall.</i>

00:31.465 --> 00:33.100
Because we all know
a butch lesbian

00:33.133 --> 00:34.434
or a trans woman of color

00:34.468 --> 00:36.370
probably threw the first brick
at Stonewall,

00:36.403 --> 00:39.507
but it was a cis, white, gay
man who threw the 11th brick.

00:39.541 --> 00:42.276
And today, as always,
I will take you on a journey

00:42.309 --> 00:45.312
throughout LGBTQ+ history
and, much more importantly,

00:45.345 --> 00:48.081
my own problems and whatever
I feel like talking about.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.183
And this is a big day,
because, as of today,

00:50.217 --> 00:54.321
<i>The 11th Brick</i> is celebrating
one million subscribers.

00:54.354 --> 00:56.290
And in honor of
all this exciting news,

00:56.323 --> 00:58.492
I am taking your questions live.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.427
- First question.
- Hi, Bobby.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.296
Any chance for
more children's books?

01:02.329 --> 01:04.164
Oh, not at the moment,
but thank you.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.300
As some of you know, I wrote
a series of children's books

01:06.333 --> 01:08.770
to help parents teach kids
about gay history,

01:08.803 --> 01:10.304
which no one bought.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.606
Turns out a four-year-old
didn't want to hear

01:11.639 --> 01:13.841
a bedtime story about
Martina Navratilova.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.877
Hey, parents, thanks for
teaching your kids about

01:15.910 --> 01:18.278
Santa Claus, a straight man
that doesn't exist,

01:18.312 --> 01:21.248
and not Martina Navratilova,
a lesbian who does.

01:21.281 --> 01:24.184
In other news, I finally got
the footage from my audition

01:24.217 --> 01:26.186
to be part of the next cast
of <i>Queer Eye,</i>

01:26.219 --> 01:29.189
and you can watch that
on the app right now.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.493
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my...

01:37.364 --> 01:38.900
I'm sorry. This is not sad.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.434
It's just not sad.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.537
You gave him a haircut
and a pair of pants.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.872
I mean, he looks fine.

01:44.906 --> 01:46.674
-Not great.
<i>-Next caller.</i>

01:46.708 --> 01:48.610
What ever happened
to that movie you wrote?

01:48.643 --> 01:50.143
Oh, yeah. The movie.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.646
These big movie producers
came to me and said,

01:51.679 --> 01:54.481
<i>"We want you to write a rom-com</i>
<i>about a gay couple.</i>

01:54.515 --> 01:56.316
<i>"Something the whole world</i>
<i>would enjoy.</i>

01:56.350 --> 01:57.885
<i>"Something that a straight guy</i>
<i>might even like</i>

01:57.919 --> 01:59.654
<i>and watch with his girlfriend."</i>
<i>I said,</i>

01:59.687 --> 02:02.322
<i>"Something a straight guy</i>
<i>might like? Like what exactly?</i>

02:02.356 --> 02:04.257
<i>"Am I gonna be in the middle</i>
<i>of some high-speed chase,</i>

02:04.291 --> 02:06.326
<i>"and then all of a sudden</i>
<i>fall in love with Ice Cube?</i>

02:06.360 --> 02:08.462
<i>"Am I gonna get butt-fucked</i>
<i>by Jason Momoa</i>

02:08.495 --> 02:11.733
<i>while we're both, I don't know,</i>
<i>worrying about a volcano?"</i>

02:11.766 --> 02:14.301
<i>And he said, "Bobby,</i>
<i>we just want to make a movie</i>

02:14.334 --> 02:17.204
<i>"that shows the world</i>
<i>gay and straight relationships</i>

02:17.237 --> 02:18.305
<i>"are the same.</i>

02:18.338 --> 02:20.340
<i>Love is love is love."</i>

02:20.374 --> 02:22.175
<i>I said, "Love is love is love?</i>

02:22.209 --> 02:23.678
<i>"No, it's not. That's bullshit.</i>

02:23.711 --> 02:26.279
<i>"That is a lie we had to</i>
<i>make up to convince you idiots</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:27.915
<i>"to finally treat us fairly.</i>

02:27.949 --> 02:29.416
<i>"Love is not love.</i>

02:29.449 --> 02:30.518
<i>"Our relationships</i>
<i>are different.</i>

02:30.551 --> 02:32.352
<i>Our sex lives are different."</i>

02:32.386 --> 02:33.921
<i>And he said, "Bobby,</i>
<i>we were just trying to make</i>

02:33.955 --> 02:36.390
<i>a nice movie</i>
<i>about nice gay people."</i>

02:36.423 --> 02:38.860
<i>And I said, "Well,</i>
<i>there's your first mistake,</i>

02:38.893 --> 02:41.596
<i>because not all gay people</i>
<i>are nice."</i>

02:41.629 --> 02:42.797
<i>And I got up and left.</i>

02:42.830 --> 02:44.364
<i>Anyway, it's totally fine.</i>

02:44.398 --> 02:45.867
I'm not the right person
to write a rom-com anyway.

02:45.900 --> 02:46.834
Why not?

02:46.868 --> 02:49.469
Um, I don't know.

02:49.504 --> 02:52.406
I mean, I'm 40 years old.
I've never been in love.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.942
I've never even had a serious
relationship, which is fine.

02:54.976 --> 02:56.744
You know, I love my life.
I love my freedom.

02:56.778 --> 02:59.614
I love my independence,
but, you know,

02:59.647 --> 03:01.214
probably means
I'm not the right person

03:01.248 --> 03:02.550
to write a love story.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.419
In exciting news,
I remain very horny,

03:05.452 --> 03:09.356
and tonight I am being honored
at the LGBTQ+ Pride Awards.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.564
Being in the NFL, I never
thought I could come out.

03:16.597 --> 03:20.802
For years, I had to suffer
as a hot, ripped, gay person,

03:20.835 --> 03:22.369
living my life in private.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.806
But this last year
has really shown me

03:24.839 --> 03:29.711
how amazing life can be when
you are finally publicly hot.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.580
Thank you.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.682
And now, please welcome

03:34.716 --> 03:37.719
Emmy and Tony Award winner
Kristin Chenoweth.

03:37.752 --> 03:39.319
Good evening.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.723
What an honor for me
to be here tonight.

03:41.756 --> 03:45.760
On my head is a hat
depicting the Stonewall riots,

03:45.793 --> 03:48.462
where the queer liberation
movement began.

03:48.495 --> 03:53.501
And now, the award for cis,
white, gay man of the year.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.337
Please welcome Bobby Leiber.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.873
Thank you.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.007
Oh, my goodness.

04:00.041 --> 04:02.677
Thank you, New York! Thank you!

04:03.644 --> 04:05.312
Thank you.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.881
Meet Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum,

04:06.914 --> 04:09.050
the Bert and Ernie
of Ancient Egypt.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.686
Many scholars believe
that they are

04:11.719 --> 04:14.956
the first recorded
same-sex couple in history.

04:14.989 --> 04:17.692
Yet to this day,
there are historians

04:17.725 --> 04:20.528
who refuse to believe
that these men were lovers

04:20.561 --> 04:22.730
and insist that
they were brothers instead.

04:22.764 --> 04:27.034
Thus began 5,000 years
of queer love stories

04:27.068 --> 04:28.636
erased from the history books.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.005
No gay love stories
to teach us about love

04:31.038 --> 04:32.573
and how to love each other.

04:32.607 --> 04:36.511
Well, I'm happy to say
this erasure ends today.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.479
And I am thrilled to announce
I have accepted a position

04:39.514 --> 04:41.916

of the first

04:41.949 --> 04:44.719

Okay, uh, so, I totally know
this is a little weird

and unexpected,
but the reason we've been

08:20.901 --> 08:23.170
hanging around with Marty
so much is that

08:23.204 --> 08:27.274
we are kind of dating him.

08:27.308 --> 08:28.275
-Oh.
-Okay.

I mean, together,
like, as a couple.

08:35.016 --> 08:36.317
We're seeing him.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.286
I guess it's kind of like
a throuple situation.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.888
Hold on.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.990
So, wait, what does
that mean exactly?

08:43.024 --> 08:45.559
Like, are you guys just having
threesomes or something?

08:45.593 --> 08:47.795
Well, we hooked up,
but then we started spending

08:47.828 --> 08:49.330
a bunch of time together after.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.132
It turns out
we have a lot in common.

it'd get that serious.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.745
We are horny and selfish
and stupid. I am, too.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.914
Yeah, someone called into my
show the other day and asked me

09:39.947 --> 09:41.949
why I'm still single.
I said, "You want to know why?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.684
"Because I've been gay
my whole life,

09:43.717 --> 09:45.686
and I don't trust
these gay motherfuckers."

09:45.719 --> 09:47.688
I support them,
but I don't trust them.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.224
-And are you happy?
-Who's so happy all the time?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.692
Uh, a lot of people.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.260
Well, I really don't trust
those people.

Sorry. I love your podcast.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.265

-Oh, sure.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.235
Thank you.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.803
-Mm-hmm.
- Shit.

10:02.837 --> 10:04.705
I told Henry I'd meet him
at this launch party.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.141
Ugh, I wanted to go home
and change first.

your shirts off anyway?

take our shirts off.

10:13.247 --> 10:15.983
You have a very clichéd view
of what gay men do at a party.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.758
♪ We all move together... ♪

10:24.792 --> 10:26.727
What app is this for again?

10:26.760 --> 10:29.263
It's this new hookup app
my company is launching.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.098
We've got Grindr.
We've got Tinder.

10:31.132 --> 10:32.766
This is Zellweger.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.368
It's for gay guys who just want
to talk about actresses

10:34.401 --> 10:36.337
-then go to bed.
-Oh, I'd use that.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.140
Bobby, I had sex
with a 65-year-old.

10:39.173 --> 10:40.741
Sixty-five?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.743
He didn't have an age
on his profile.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.412
He was really nice,
he had an amazing body,

10:45.446 --> 10:47.248
but he had this, like,
big, white beard.

10:47.281 --> 10:49.016
I felt like Mrs. Claus.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.751
I kind of love that.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.920
There's that guy Aaron.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.258
♪ Together, together, together ♪

10:57.291 --> 10:59.160
♪ We all move together ♪

10:59.193 --> 11:01.061
♪ Together, together ♪

11:01.095 --> 11:02.329
♪ We all move... ♪

11:02.363 --> 11:04.165
Oh, yeah, I don't know
who that is.

11:04.198 --> 11:06.167
He's at the gym sometimes.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.335
Very hot. Very boring.

11:08.369 --> 11:10.771
-Oh, what else is new?
-Oh.

11:10.804 --> 11:14.308
Also, today I had sex
with a guy who peed on me.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.776
Oh, are you into that?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.144
Not really,
but what else was I doing?

11:17.178 --> 11:18.212
Fair enough.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.780
It was honestly kind of boring.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.116
Hey, what's up?

11:22.149 --> 11:23.951
Hey.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.986
-Well, hello, Aaron.
-Hey.

11:26.020 --> 11:26.954
This is Bobby.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.822
Do you boys need another drink?

11:28.856 --> 11:30.991
-I'm getting a shitrocket.
-What the hell's a shitrocket?

11:31.025 --> 11:32.960
It's like a Red Bull
but with protein.

11:32.993 --> 11:33.894
Oh.

11:33.928 --> 11:35.930
Shitrocket and vodka, I guess.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.065
Move, boys. Daddy needs a drink.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.833
Thank you.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.475
You look angry.

11:48.510 --> 11:50.110
Me?

11:50.144 --> 11:51.312
Well, I'm not.

11:51.345 --> 11:52.980
That's just the way I look.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.082
I know. People always come up
to me and tell me that,

11:55.115 --> 11:57.117
but I'm not.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.687
I'm not angry.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.121
I listen to your podcast.

12:01.155 --> 12:02.456
Oh, really?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.058
Oh, that's cool.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.761
I hear you're boring.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.463
Who said that? I'm not boring.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.232
I don't know.

12:11.265 --> 12:12.399
A lot of people.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.101
Cool.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.105
I'm sorry. That was mean.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.175
I'm very bad at flirting.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.811
And I'm also the type of person
who tells you I'm flirting,

12:23.844 --> 12:25.513
which is so sexy.

12:25.547 --> 12:27.348
It's okay.

12:28.449 --> 12:30.851
What do you do?

12:30.884 --> 12:32.520
Uh, for work?

12:32.554 --> 12:34.922
I do probate law.
I'm an estate planner.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.524
Basically, I write
people's wills.

12:36.558 --> 12:38.560
-Do you like it?
-Oh, sure.

12:38.593 --> 12:40.562
When I was a kid,
first thing I would think

12:40.595 --> 12:42.096
when I would meet someone is,
"Who's that person

12:42.129 --> 12:44.198
gonna leave their shit to
when they die?"

12:44.231 --> 12:48.202
I really wanted to be part of
the legal logistics of that.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.272
That's funny.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.809
That guy's hot, right?

12:56.611 --> 12:59.013
Oh, yeah. He is.

12:59.046 --> 13:02.783
I'm supposed to fuck him
and his husband later.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.487
Cool.

13:06.521 --> 13:09.156
Very good.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.493
-Oh, I love this song.
-What is this?

13:12.527 --> 13:14.228
Old-school Mariah.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.397
How do you not know this?

13:16.430 --> 13:18.432
I'm more of a country guy.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.200
You know, like Garth Brooks.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.436
Garth Brooks?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.104
Who are you?

13:24.138 --> 13:26.974

and although I should ♪

13:27.007 --> 13:29.910
♪ I can't leave you alone

13:29.943 --> 13:32.846

13:36.417 --> 13:37.885

13:37.918 --> 13:40.354
-Where the fuck did he go?
-I don't know.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.989
This is why I hate these people.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.358
Oh, my God.
That's the 65-year-old.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.260
Jesus, he's ripped.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.631
I know. It's like they injected
steroids into Dumbledore.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.407
Hey, what's up?

14:00.441 --> 14:01.643
-Thanks.
-Hey.

14:01.676 --> 14:03.477
Where'd you go?

14:03.511 --> 14:05.112
I don't know. Nowhere.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.585
Yas, live your lives, queens!

14:10.618 --> 14:12.419
Okurrr.

14:13.688 --> 14:16.256
Gay guys are so stupid.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.891
Oh, my God, I know.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.094
Gay guys are usually, like,
the absolute smartest

14:20.127 --> 14:23.063
or, like, the dumbest people
I've ever met.

14:23.097 --> 14:24.532
We've been smart enough
to brand ourselves

14:24.566 --> 14:25.567
as being smart and clever.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.101
I've hooked up with guys,

14:27.134 --> 14:28.503
and afterwards I'll make a joke

14:28.536 --> 14:30.337
or I'll say something sarcastic.

14:30.371 --> 14:32.940
And the guy does not understand
that I'm making a joke.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.677
Literally does not
understand satire.

14:35.710 --> 14:37.111
I know.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.113
And straight people think
we're all smart,

14:39.146 --> 14:42.116
-but a lot of these guys
are dumb as shit. -Yes.

14:43.718 --> 14:45.285
It's our little secret.

14:57.331 --> 14:58.899
Actually...

15:01.034 --> 15:03.237
Are you fucking kidding me?

15:05.272 --> 15:06.541
-Hey.
-Hey, what were you talking

15:06.574 --> 15:08.142
to Aaron about for so long?

15:08.175 --> 15:09.209
Just about how a lot of gay guys

15:09.243 --> 15:10.678
are secretly incredibly stupid.

15:10.712 --> 15:12.212
-Oh, how fabulous.
-I don't understand.

15:12.246 --> 15:14.181
We're having a good time,
and then he ghosts me.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.450
He just fucking disappears.

15:19.219 --> 15:22.289
Bobby, don't. Let it go.
He's a dick.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.025
No, I am not letting it go.
I do not let things go.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.694
-Why aren't you dancing?
-I am dancing, okay?

15:26.728 --> 15:29.263
What do you want me to do,
the fucking <i>Nutcracker Suite?</i>

15:30.497 --> 15:32.399
Hey.

15:32.433 --> 15:33.568
Hey, what's up?

15:33.601 --> 15:35.102
I tried to kiss you

15:35.135 --> 15:36.036
and you didn't kiss me back
is what's up.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.605
I'm sorry. I'm shy.

15:37.639 --> 15:39.239
Please. What are you into?

15:39.273 --> 15:41.241
One of these boring,
ripped idiots with no opinions?

15:41.275 --> 15:44.011
No, I'd like someone
who's physically very frail

15:44.044 --> 15:46.013
and won't stop talking.

15:53.688 --> 15:55.723
Come home with me.

15:55.757 --> 15:57.559
I can't.

15:57.592 --> 15:59.259
Why?

15:59.293 --> 16:01.261
'Cause you have to fuck
the fake baseball player

16:01.295 --> 16:02.196
and his husband?

16:02.229 --> 16:05.132
I don't know what to tell you.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.167
-Goodbye.
-Hey, wait, wait.

16:07.201 --> 16:08.670
-Take my number.
-Absolutely not.

16:08.703 --> 16:10.070
Why?

16:10.103 --> 16:11.706
'Cause I'm one of
the smart ones, asshole.

16:11.739 --> 16:13.741
Oh, are you
emotionally unavailable?

16:13.775 --> 16:16.009
No one's more emotionally
unavailable than me.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.111
No one. I pride myself on that.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.413
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.615
Henry has my number.

16:20.648 --> 16:22.249
See you on Grindr or Zellweger

16:22.282 --> 16:24.017
or whatever the fuck
the next one is.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.520
I'm not on any of those.

16:25.553 --> 16:27.522
Then how do you meet people?

16:28.523 --> 16:30.257
I'm not really looking.

16:31.325 --> 16:33.026
Yeah.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.128
Me neither.

16:37.665 --> 16:39.767
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:39.801 --> 16:41.201
Excuse me.

16:41.235 --> 16:42.504
Oh, my God,
they cannot stop voguing.

16:42.537 --> 16:43.771
They cannot stop voguing!

16:43.805 --> 16:45.507
Excuse me.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.775
I know you're voguing, but
can I please go home? Please?!

16:47.809 --> 16:50.143
I had a gut feeling

16:50.177 --> 16:51.513
you would be online now.

16:51.546 --> 16:53.113
Hi.

16:55.550 --> 16:57.785
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

16:57.819 --> 17:00.287
<i>Not much. You?</i>

17:01.188 --> 17:03.056
No.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.225
<i>But us texting</i>
<i>each other anonymously.</i>

17:05.259 --> 17:06.794

<i>Ha ha. LOL. Dick pic?</i>

17:11.198 --> 17:13.300
<i>No dick pic. Sorry.</i>

17:13.333 --> 17:15.302
<i>Think about</i> You've Got Mail.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.471
<i>Meg Ryan would never send you</i>
<i>a picture of her genitalia.</i>

17:17.505 --> 17:20.173
<i>Ha ha.</i>
<i>LOLOL. Can I see your ass?</i>

17:20.207 --> 17:22.476
<i>Don't have ass pic. Sorry.</i>

17:22.510 --> 17:24.244
<i>Need to see ass pic, though.</i>

17:24.278 --> 17:25.345
<i>Don't have ass pic!</i>

17:25.379 --> 17:26.581
<i>Not gonna meet up</i>

17:26.614 --> 17:28.482
<i>unless you send ass pic.</i>

17:28.516 --> 17:30.818
<i>Must see pic of ass!</i>

17:47.535 --> 17:48.503
Ow!

17:48.536 --> 17:50.572
Fuck!

17:50.605 --> 17:51.806
I'm bleeding!

17:51.839 --> 17:53.440
How am I gonna shit now?

17:53.473 --> 17:55.810
I can't fuck. I can't shit.

17:55.843 --> 17:58.345
I'm not a person, goddamn it!

18:02.617 --> 18:04.652
It's too fucking flat.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.465
<i>Took this just for you, bro.</i>

18:23.437 --> 18:24.505
Did he block me?

18:24.539 --> 18:26.674
Motherfucker!

18:26.708 --> 18:28.342
Hallheart proudly presents

18:28.375 --> 18:30.612
our first bisexual holiday film,

18:30.645 --> 18:34.414
the award-winning
<i>Christmas with Either.</i>

18:34.448 --> 18:36.884
Hallheart.
Always on the cutting edge...

18:36.918 --> 18:39.621
of Christmas.

18:40.822 --> 18:43.390
<i>People. Okay.</i>

18:43.423 --> 18:44.759
<i>Okay, people!</i>

18:44.792 --> 18:46.360
People, please!
It's getting late.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.195
We still need to find
a donor to fund

18:48.228 --> 18:49.697
the exhibit in the final wing.

18:49.731 --> 18:51.633
As you know, Pier 1 Imports
was supposed to make

18:51.666 --> 18:53.300
a big donation,
but they went bankrupt

18:53.333 --> 18:54.769
and have been
bought by the Taliban.

18:54.802 --> 18:55.870
Taliban.

18:55.903 --> 18:58.405
So, we are short $5 million.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.240
We cannot afford
to push our opening again.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.475
People will think
we're in trouble.

19:01.509 --> 19:03.310
Maybe this whole place
could fall apart.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.879
We need new ideas for
what goes in the final wing,

19:04.912 --> 19:06.246
and we need them now.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.515
-Cherry, go.
-You know the blue whale

19:07.548 --> 19:09.249
hanging in
the Museum of Natural History?

19:09.282 --> 19:10.952
-Yes.
-What about that,

19:10.985 --> 19:15.255
but instead of the blue whale,
it's a lesbian?

19:15.288 --> 19:17.224
- Oh, no. Uh-uh.
- Yeah, okay.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.726
-Well, yeah, we can't do that.
-No.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.796
What about a transgender woman
from an Indigenous nation?

19:21.829 --> 19:22.864
Goddamn it, Wanda!

19:22.897 --> 19:24.966
What about the 400 lesbians

19:24.999 --> 19:26.534
who fought in the Civil War?

19:26.567 --> 19:28.670
Shut up, Cherry.
They were not all lesbians.

19:28.703 --> 19:30.203
Some of them were trans men.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.272
Okay, stop.
This building is a rare chance

19:32.305 --> 19:35.677
to legitimize
the history of bisexuals.

19:35.710 --> 19:36.778
Oh, God. Here we go.

19:36.811 --> 19:39.312
Yes! We say "LGBTQ,"

19:39.346 --> 19:40.782
but we always skip over the "B."

19:40.815 --> 19:43.417
I want a hall of bisexuals,

19:43.450 --> 19:45.285
like Disney's
Hall of Presidents.

19:45.318 --> 19:49.557
I want a stage full of
animatronic, talking bisexuals.

19:49.590 --> 19:51.859
Talking and moving
and gesturing bisexuals.

19:51.893 --> 19:53.360
You know what?

19:53.393 --> 19:55.830
This happens to be
Bisexual Awareness Week,

19:55.863 --> 19:58.866
and no one has acknowledged it!

19:58.900 --> 20:01.468
-I acknowledged.
-That is true. My bad.

20:01.502 --> 20:04.005
Lesbian History Month
was in March.

20:04.038 --> 20:05.973
Nobody said a goddamn thing!

20:06.007 --> 20:07.675
It's June!

20:07.709 --> 20:09.242
It was in March!

20:09.276 --> 20:11.679
Of course lesbians get a month
and we get a week.

20:11.713 --> 20:13.413
-Robert.
-What?

20:13.447 --> 20:15.315
I want you to know
that I hear you.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.384
I see you,
and I'm holding space for you.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.486
There she go. There she go.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.421
She never has
any ideas of her own,

20:21.455 --> 20:23.891
but she's always
"holding space."

20:23.925 --> 20:26.326
A lesbian wrote
"America the Beautiful."

20:26.359 --> 20:28.462
-God, no. I can't.
-Katharine Lee Bates

20:28.495 --> 20:29.931
wrote the lyrics on a napkin.

20:29.964 --> 20:34.301
If you go to her house in
Virginia, they have the napkin!

20:34.334 --> 20:35.970
What if the final exhibit was

20:36.003 --> 20:38.472
a recreation of a queer wedding?

20:38.506 --> 20:40.373
-I like that.
-Okay, that I don't hate.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.476
Tamara, that is so sweet.

20:42.510 --> 20:43.745
I love that. And people can

20:43.778 --> 20:45.378
come and register
for wedding gifts here.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.681
I'm gonna write that down.

20:46.714 --> 20:47.749
Oh, my God, and-- No!

20:47.782 --> 20:48.883
That is old-fashioned,

20:48.916 --> 20:50.417
heteronormative nonsense.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.619
We need to get people
to rethink history

20:51.652 --> 20:53.621
through a queer prism,
not comfort them

20:53.654 --> 20:55.556
with another
fucking gay wedding, all right?

20:55.590 --> 20:57.424
It's a museum.
It's not <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>

20:57.457 --> 20:58.458
-Ooh, I like <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>
-But I--

20:58.492 --> 20:59.761
Oh, I love <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>

20:59.794 --> 21:01.495
- That show has layers.
- All right.

21:01.529 --> 21:02.764
Everyone loves <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>
Great. Okay.

21:02.797 --> 21:05.332
That's who you remind me of.
Eugene Levy.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.634
Yes.

21:06.667 --> 21:09.302
Okay, Mr. Funk.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.371
How can I help you today?

21:11.404 --> 21:13.306
I need to adjust my will.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.042
Okay. Can I ask you why?

21:15.076 --> 21:16.744
Because I'm dying.

21:16.778 --> 21:17.979
I have cancer.

21:18.012 --> 21:19.514
I'm so sorry to hear that.

21:19.547 --> 21:22.449
I just need to figure out
where my money's going.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.052
Okay, uh, do you have
a partner or spouse?

21:25.086 --> 21:26.788
No and no.

21:26.821 --> 21:27.922
-Children?
-No.

21:27.955 --> 21:29.590
-Family member?
-No.

21:29.624 --> 21:32.093
-Close friend?
-Not anymore.

21:32.126 --> 21:34.494
Okay, um...

21:34.529 --> 21:36.764
well, uh, sometimes it helps
to close your eyes

21:36.798 --> 21:40.501
and think about who means
the most to you in the world.

21:44.906 --> 21:46.073
Uh, who is it?

21:46.107 --> 21:48.075
Cher.

21:48.109 --> 21:53.080
Okay, so you want
to leave $100,000...

21:53.114 --> 21:54.549
to Cher?

21:55.516 --> 21:57.384
Do you really think
that she needs that?

21:57.417 --> 21:59.554
She has a huge staff.

21:59.587 --> 22:00.822
Uh, okay.

22:00.855 --> 22:02.422
Mr. Shepard, uh--
Sorry to interrupt.

22:02.455 --> 22:05.425
Mrs. Bailey passed away.

22:06.661 --> 22:09.130
Oh, God, this is so depressing.

22:09.163 --> 22:10.665
I'm so sorry.

22:10.698 --> 22:11.966
I can only imagine
what you're going through.

22:11.999 --> 22:14.035
No, I mean your job.

22:14.068 --> 22:15.603
What a downer.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.777
<i>It's Aaron. How's Grindr?</i>

22:24.545 --> 22:26.413
<i>A dream. I spent 45 minutes</i>

22:26.446 --> 22:28.015
<i>taking a picture of my own ass.</i>

22:28.049 --> 22:29.717
<i>How are you?</i>

22:29.750 --> 22:31.552
<i>How was group sex</i>
<i>with that faux Chicago Cub?</i>

22:31.586 --> 22:33.588
<i>It was fun.</i>
<i>They invited me back tomorrow.</i>

22:33.621 --> 22:35.122
<i>Their surrogate is pregnant,</i>

22:35.156 --> 22:36.557
<i>and they're having</i>
<i>a gender reveal orgy.</i>

22:36.591 --> 22:38.125
<i>A gender reveal orgy?</i>

22:38.159 --> 22:40.127
<i>James Baldwin would be so proud.</i>

22:44.665 --> 22:46.634
<i>LOL. I woke up laughing about</i>

22:46.667 --> 22:48.870
<i>you so rudely calling me out</i>
<i>on my shit.</i>

22:48.903 --> 22:50.538
<i>Well, you deserved it, bitch.</i>

22:50.571 --> 22:52.073
<i>Honestly, I was impressed.</i>

22:52.106 --> 22:53.941
<i>You may be more emotionally</i>
<i>unavailable than I am.</i>

22:53.975 --> 22:55.442
<i>Well, maybe we can be</i>

22:55.475 --> 22:56.577
<i>emotionally unavailable</i>
<i>together.</i>

22:56.611 --> 22:58.012
<i>"Maybe we can be</i>

22:58.045 --> 22:59.547
<i>emotionally unavailable</i>
<i>together"?</i>

22:59.580 --> 23:01.481
<i>Who's writing your texts?</i>
<i>Maroon 5?</i>

23:01.515 --> 23:03.184
<i>- Fuck off.</i>
<i>- Kidding!</i>

23:03.217 --> 23:05.186
<i>We can go out.</i>
<i>Are you asking me out?</i>

23:05.219 --> 23:07.121
<i>- I'm down for whatever.</i>
<i>- Yeah, same.</i>

23:07.154 --> 23:08.789
<i>-Cool.</i>
<i>-Sounds good.</i>

23:08.823 --> 23:10.591
<i>So, tomorrow?</i>
<i>Or we can do whatever.</i>

23:10.625 --> 23:12.492
<i>Yeah, I can do</i>
<i>whenever, and I can do whatever.</i>

23:12.526 --> 23:13.961
<i>-I don't care</i>
<i>what we do. -Yeah, me neither.</i>

23:13.995 --> 23:15.930
<i>We can do whatever,</i>
<i>and we can do it whenever.</i>

23:15.963 --> 23:18.065
<i>-Does that work for you?</i>
<i>-Yeah, that definitely works.</i>

23:18.099 --> 23:19.734
<i>Great. Whatever, whenever.</i>

23:19.767 --> 23:21.035
<i>Cool. Whatever, whenever.</i>

23:21.068 --> 23:22.770
<i>GIF of Michael Scott dancing.</i>

23:22.803 --> 23:23.771
He's good.

23:23.804 --> 23:24.805
<i>Office</i> GIF?

23:24.839 --> 23:26.173
This person isn't gay.

23:26.207 --> 23:27.808
<i>Heart. Ugh, no.</i>

23:27.842 --> 23:29.110
<i>Un-heart. Thumbs up.</i>

23:29.143 --> 23:31.779
<i>- Peace.</i>
- Peace?

23:31.812 --> 23:32.914
<i>Later.</i>

23:33.948 --> 23:35.750
Can you heart my "later," bitch?

23:35.783 --> 23:37.018
<i>Bye.</i>

23:42.489 --> 23:43.691
You're from here, right?

23:43.724 --> 23:45.192
Your parents still live
in the city?

23:45.226 --> 23:47.662
No. My parents
both passed away actually.

23:47.695 --> 23:49.997
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Oh, yeah. Thanks.

23:50.031 --> 23:51.198
It wasn't recent.

23:51.232 --> 23:52.667
My mom died
when I was in college,

23:52.700 --> 23:55.036
and my dad died
like ten years ago.

23:55.069 --> 23:56.537
A bee! A bee! A bee!

23:56.570 --> 23:57.772
-A bee! A bee! A bee!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:57.805 --> 23:59.073
Stop swatting.
You're gonna kill it.

23:59.106 --> 23:59.907
Well, that's what
I'm trying to do.

23:59.941 --> 24:01.108
It's on my neck.

24:01.142 --> 24:02.176
The bees are dying.
Don't you read?

24:02.209 --> 24:03.678
Yes, about gay stuff and movies.

24:03.711 --> 24:04.679
-Can you, like, do something?
-Yes.

24:04.712 --> 24:05.813
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Here it is.

24:05.846 --> 24:07.782
-You're touching the bee!
-I know.

24:07.815 --> 24:09.617
Okay.

24:10.885 --> 24:13.087
Wow. Thank you.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.956
You're like
a grown-up gay Boy Scout,

24:14.989 --> 24:18.559
and I'm like whatever ends up
happening to Evan Hansen.

24:18.592 --> 24:20.962
Let me see what's playing.

24:22.563 --> 24:24.497
What's your favorite movie
of all time?

24:24.532 --> 24:26.233
What's my favorite movie
of all time?

24:26.267 --> 24:27.501
I don't know.

24:27.535 --> 24:29.136
Why? What's your favorite movie?

24:29.170 --> 24:30.838
<i>The Hangover.</i>

24:30.871 --> 24:33.841
<i>The Hangover</i> is your favorite
movie of all time?

24:33.874 --> 24:35.743
How many movies have you seen?
One?

24:35.776 --> 24:37.878
-It's a funny movie.
-Yeah, kinda.

24:37.912 --> 24:40.281
And you remember one of
the first lines of that movie?

24:40.314 --> 24:42.116
"Paging Dr. Faggot."

24:42.149 --> 24:43.617
-Remember that?
-Yes.

24:43.651 --> 24:45.252
"Paging Dr. Faggot"
is one of the first lines

24:45.286 --> 24:47.121
of the highest-grossing comedy
of 2009,

24:47.154 --> 24:48.556
and-and no one talks about it.

24:48.589 --> 24:50.124
Right?
And it wasn't that long ago.

24:50.157 --> 24:51.892
You know, we're just supposed
to, like, laugh it off.

24:51.926 --> 24:54.762
It doesn't bother me.
I'm not sensitive like that.

24:54.795 --> 24:56.697
I think you just like
getting angry at things.

24:56.731 --> 24:58.699
Getting angry at things
is, like, your brand.

24:58.733 --> 25:01.569
What?! No, it's not! Fuck you!

25:01.602 --> 25:03.137
Getting angry at things
is my brand?

25:03.170 --> 25:04.605
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

25:04.638 --> 25:05.873
You just don't like
to complain about it

25:05.906 --> 25:07.274
because that means
your feelings were hurt,

25:07.308 --> 25:08.609
and that means
admitting you're weak.

25:08.642 --> 25:09.877
And that's too vulnerable.

25:09.910 --> 25:11.645
And as much as
we go around saying

25:11.679 --> 25:13.247
men should be vulnerable,
you and I both know

25:13.280 --> 25:14.648
that is such bullshit.

25:14.682 --> 25:16.083
Because for
a lot of these gay guys,

25:16.117 --> 25:18.619
sweetness and vulnerability
are wonderful and lovely,

25:18.652 --> 25:20.788
but they can also be
a real boner killer.

25:22.156 --> 25:24.058
You're very intense.

25:24.091 --> 25:25.626
Yes.

25:26.327 --> 25:28.662
-I was kidding, by the way.
-About what?

25:28.696 --> 25:31.565
<i>The Hangover.</i>
It's not my favorite movie.

25:31.599 --> 25:33.334
-No, you weren't.
-Yeah, I was.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.703
I just like seeing you
get riled up.

25:35.736 --> 25:38.773
-I don't believe you.
-I was kidding.

25:40.341 --> 25:42.043
Hmm.

25:42.076 --> 25:43.911
I don't like this.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.917
Okay.
Let's see what we have here.

25:49.950 --> 25:51.152
Mm-hmm.

25:51.185 --> 25:52.720
Oh, <i>The Treasure Inside</i>

25:52.753 --> 25:54.088
is supposed to be
really good, actually.

25:54.121 --> 25:55.623
What's that about?

25:55.656 --> 25:56.924
It's about
two closeted gay frontiersmen

25:56.957 --> 25:59.760
in the California Gold Rush
of 1849.

25:59.794 --> 26:01.729
But really it's about two
straight actors playing gay,

26:01.762 --> 26:03.064
trying to win an Oscar.

26:03.097 --> 26:05.800
I never tire of watching
two very straight actors

26:05.833 --> 26:08.002
really transform themselves
into being sad and gay.

26:08.035 --> 26:10.704
Gay actors playing gay--
that's not even acting.

26:10.738 --> 26:12.006
Oh, I totally agree.

26:12.039 --> 26:13.774
If they ever make a movie
about my life,

26:13.808 --> 26:15.309
they better hire
a straight actor.

26:15.342 --> 26:17.044
I like to think of
my life story as

26:17.078 --> 26:19.280
just another way for Benedict
Cumberbatch to really score.

26:19.313 --> 26:22.683
Okay, if we don't see this
movie, what are we gonna do?

26:22.716 --> 26:24.685
Well, I didn't say
I didn't want to see the movie.

26:24.718 --> 26:26.153
-Oh.
-I'll see the fucking movie.

26:26.187 --> 26:29.023
I'm dying to.

26:29.056 --> 26:31.759
I'd put it way above
<i>Call Me by Your Name</i>

26:31.792 --> 26:34.195
but sort of below <i>Dallas Buyers.</i>

26:34.228 --> 26:35.796
Well, it got me in the end.

26:35.830 --> 26:37.798
Yeah, but why does it always
have to be so tragic?

26:37.832 --> 26:40.267
I don't know.
<i>Philadelphia, Milk, Brokeback.</i>

26:40.301 --> 26:41.902
Happy endings don't win Oscars.

26:41.936 --> 26:44.205
Straight people love
seeing us miserable.

26:44.238 --> 26:46.373
- Mm.
- Wait, Aaron Shepard?

26:46.407 --> 26:48.142
Josh Evans?

26:48.175 --> 26:51.112
-Holy shit! What is up, dude?
-Hey, man. Bro!

26:51.145 --> 26:53.114
-Nice to see you.
-It's been for-fucking-ever.

26:53.147 --> 26:54.882
Aaron and I-- we played hockey
in high school.

26:54.915 --> 26:56.383
This is my fiancée Samantha.

26:56.417 --> 26:58.219
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

26:58.252 --> 26:59.854
Uh, this is, uh, Bobby.

26:59.887 --> 27:00.921
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:00.955 --> 27:02.323
We just saw <i>The Treasure Inside.</i>

27:02.356 --> 27:04.191
It's about
closeted gay frontiersmen.

27:04.225 --> 27:05.759
Oh. Okay. Nice.

27:05.793 --> 27:07.828
It's just,
like, some dumb movie.

27:07.862 --> 27:09.330
Oh, wait. I want to see that.

27:09.363 --> 27:11.065
Gay guys are my jam.

27:11.098 --> 27:12.666
Hmm.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.235
So what are you guys doing here?

27:14.268 --> 27:15.736
Just a little trip.

27:15.769 --> 27:17.104
It's her first time
in New York City.

27:17.138 --> 27:18.172
This city is sick.

27:18.205 --> 27:20.941
-It really is.
-Yeah.

27:20.975 --> 27:22.409
Well... awesome.

27:22.443 --> 27:23.777
-Yeah.
-Uh, nice to meet you, Bob.

27:23.811 --> 27:25.279
Nice to meet you guys.

27:25.312 --> 27:26.847
That is crazy.

27:26.881 --> 27:29.283
I never run into anybody
from my hometown.

27:29.316 --> 27:30.885
Oh, yeah, bro. Totally, bro.

27:30.918 --> 27:33.420
Just some dumb movie, bro.

27:33.454 --> 27:35.422
I had the biggest crush on him
in high school.

27:35.456 --> 27:37.424
Yep. That tracks.

27:38.392 --> 27:41.829
Well, like the bearded lady
in <i>The Greatest Showman,</i>

27:41.862 --> 27:44.198
this is me.

27:45.232 --> 27:46.867
Oh.

27:47.868 --> 27:49.403
The faux Chicago Cub?

27:49.436 --> 27:51.305
Yeah. His husband
just sent me that.

27:51.338 --> 27:54.308
Wow. They are extremely hot.

27:54.341 --> 27:56.710
Yeah, Mike and Doug-- they're
these roided-out meatheads.

27:56.744 --> 27:58.879
They're not the brightest,
but they're really sweet.

27:59.747 --> 28:00.981
Do you want to go over there?

28:01.015 --> 28:02.783
Wait. Are you ditching me again

28:02.816 --> 28:04.919
to go fuck the baseball
cosplayer and his husband?

28:04.952 --> 28:07.254
No, I'm not ditching you.
I'm inviting you.

28:08.856 --> 28:10.457
Why don't you
just come upstairs?

28:10.491 --> 28:14.195
Ah, I don't really do the whole
relationship thing very well.

28:14.228 --> 28:16.063
Relationship?

28:16.096 --> 28:19.266
When did I say I wanted to be
in a relationship with you?

28:19.300 --> 28:21.202
We literally hung out one day.

28:21.235 --> 28:22.469
Yeah, but if I go upstairs,

28:22.504 --> 28:24.471
it becomes, like,
a whole thing and...

28:24.506 --> 28:26.106
Whatever.
We should just go over there.

28:26.140 --> 28:27.341
It'll be fun.

28:27.374 --> 28:28.742
I'm not gonna go,
but you should go.

28:28.776 --> 28:30.110
Can I ask you one thing, though?

28:30.144 --> 28:32.079
Why did you text me
if you didn't want to hook up?

28:32.112 --> 28:34.481
I'm not angry.
I'm just honestly curious.

28:34.516 --> 28:37.851
I didn't say
I didn't want to-- I...

28:38.986 --> 28:40.988
I guess I had fun
talking to you at the club,

28:41.021 --> 28:43.490
and I wanted to say,
"Hey, what's up?"

28:43.525 --> 28:45.192
"Hey, what's up?"

28:45.226 --> 28:47.061
So, basically you texted me
when you were feeling hungover

28:47.094 --> 28:49.363
and lonely in that moment,
but you're not actually into me,

28:49.396 --> 28:50.831
but you went on the date anyway.

28:50.864 --> 28:53.000
Why are gay guys so weird?

28:53.033 --> 28:55.903
Actually, you know,
we're not weird.

28:55.936 --> 28:57.972
We're just constantly catering
to our own whims and needs,

28:58.005 --> 29:00.140
which can change on a dime,
but we never even think about

29:00.174 --> 29:02.142
the emotional consequences
of the other person.

29:02.176 --> 29:06.046
Anyway, it's been a blast
catering to your whims.

29:06.080 --> 29:08.983
And, honestly, I can't
really say anything about it

29:09.016 --> 29:11.352
because I do the same thing
to people all the time, so...

29:13.555 --> 29:16.090
-Fun day. And, um...
-Fun day.

29:16.123 --> 29:18.259
-Yeah.
-Have fun with those guys.

29:18.292 --> 29:20.327
Okay. Bye.

29:22.597 --> 29:24.131
Bobby, wait.

29:28.603 --> 29:33.040
♪ When you're dreaming
with a broken heart... ♪

29:33.073 --> 29:35.109
I had a really nice time today.

29:35.142 --> 29:36.076
Me, too.

29:36.110 --> 29:38.178
I never go on dates,
but that was really fun.

29:38.212 --> 29:41.048
Yeah.
I had a really good time, too.

29:52.192 --> 29:53.961
Hey, I'm gonna go.

29:53.994 --> 29:56.030
Oh, really?

29:56.063 --> 29:57.131
Yeah.

29:57.164 --> 29:58.600
Is everything okay?
Is this weird?

29:58.633 --> 30:00.568
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it's fun. It's great.

30:00.602 --> 30:02.036
I just-- I'm just gonna go.

30:02.069 --> 30:03.904
-Okay.
-Okay. I'll see you.

30:03.937 --> 30:05.406
-Okay. Bye.
-Okay.

30:05.439 --> 30:06.874
Bye.

30:06.907 --> 30:08.309
Hey, guys, I'm gonna go.
Thank you so much.

30:08.342 --> 30:10.177
-No. You're leaving?
-Yeah, I got to go.

30:10.210 --> 30:11.613
All right, man.
It was nice meeting you.

30:11.646 --> 30:13.180
-Yeah, you, too. It was lovely.
-Yeah.

30:13.213 --> 30:15.115
-Thank you.
-All right. Good night.

30:15.149 --> 30:16.350
Okay. Okay.

30:17.885 --> 30:19.453
Thanks for coming.
We're convinced Brian's gay,

30:19.486 --> 30:21.589
and I think it's good for him
to have his gay uncle around.

30:21.623 --> 30:23.257
Oh, my God. Of course.

30:23.290 --> 30:25.159
I'm always here to be a good
"guncle" to my "g-nephew."

30:25.192 --> 30:27.629
-Aw. -Uncle Bobby,
will you read my report?

30:27.662 --> 30:29.129
It's about Freddie Mercury.

30:29.163 --> 30:30.998
He's obsessed with
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody.</i>

30:31.031 --> 30:32.466
Oh, my God, I love this.

30:32.499 --> 30:34.234
And like that movie,
does your report take a story

30:34.268 --> 30:35.936
about one of the great
gay icons and make it about

30:35.969 --> 30:37.971
that one time
he maybe had sex with a woman?

30:38.005 --> 30:39.306
I thought Freddie Mercury
was bi.

30:39.340 --> 30:40.642
He had a wife.

30:40.675 --> 30:42.276
Yeah, well, so did Jesus,
and he was gay.

30:42.309 --> 30:44.278
This is excellent
and an improvement on the film.

30:44.311 --> 30:45.312
Good job!

30:46.681 --> 30:48.650
What are those GIFs
from <i>The Hangover?</i>

30:48.683 --> 30:50.217
Nothing.

30:50.250 --> 30:52.252
This guy I went out with
won't stop texting me.

30:52.286 --> 30:54.221
A guy? Really?

30:54.254 --> 30:56.023
-Like a Grindr guy?
-No, shockingly.

30:56.056 --> 30:58.092
I actually met this one
in real life.

30:58.125 --> 30:59.527
Bobby!

30:59.561 --> 31:00.961
That's fantastic!

31:00.994 --> 31:02.162
You think you're gonna
see him again?

31:02.196 --> 31:04.231
No. He told me
he prefers group sex

31:04.264 --> 31:06.568
to one-on-one because
one-on-one is too intense

31:06.601 --> 31:08.168
and makes it a whole thing.

31:08.202 --> 31:10.237
We went on one date, and
we had sex with three people.

31:10.270 --> 31:12.039
Gay relationships these days
are like a clown car.

31:12.072 --> 31:14.441
Oh, there's another one.
Oh, look, another one.

31:14.475 --> 31:16.310
Oh, another one?
It's ridiculous.

31:16.343 --> 31:18.011
Plus, I don't think
I'm his type.

31:18.045 --> 31:19.913
-How do you know?
-Because I know.

31:19.947 --> 31:21.382
He told me
he likes country music

31:21.415 --> 31:23.651
and his favorite singer
is Garth Brooks.

31:23.685 --> 31:25.018
What kind of gay man says

31:25.052 --> 31:26.353
his favorite singer
is Garth Brooks?

31:26.387 --> 31:27.388
That scares me.

31:27.421 --> 31:28.523
Plus, I see the guys he likes.

31:28.556 --> 31:30.257
They all look exactly like him.

31:30.290 --> 31:34.228
They're all these, like, big,
hot, straight-acting dudes.

31:34.261 --> 31:35.129
It's just not me.

31:35.162 --> 31:36.598
Well, is he a top or bottom?

31:36.631 --> 31:38.232
What does that
have to do with anything?

31:38.265 --> 31:39.567
Maybe you're both bottoms,
and that's the problem.

31:39.601 --> 31:42.202
I'm not always
the bottom, Edgar.

31:42.236 --> 31:43.538
Bottom dance!

31:43.571 --> 31:45.072
- Ooh, bottom dance!
- Yeah!

31:47.441 --> 31:48.543
Oh, my God.

31:48.576 --> 31:50.144
Gay sex was more fun

31:50.177 --> 31:52.012
when straight people
were uncomfortable with it.

31:52.045 --> 31:53.247
Fucking <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>

31:53.280 --> 31:54.549
Maybe we should
stop talking about

31:54.582 --> 31:56.150
anal sex
in front of your children.

31:56.183 --> 31:58.252
-Nah. -Oh, please.
It's a natural part of life.

31:58.285 --> 32:00.287
Bobby, ask him out again.
You never like anyone.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.089
He is so handsome.

32:02.122 --> 32:04.391
-So are you.
-Y-You're a hottie.

32:04.425 --> 32:07.127
He is, like, on another level.
He's like gay Tom Brady.

32:07.161 --> 32:09.163
When I'm with him,
I feel like friggin' Elphaba.

32:09.196 --> 32:11.165
I bet he's as intimidated
by you as you are by him.

32:11.198 --> 32:13.167
-Oh, yeah.
-I'm telling you.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.468
He's just scared
of being vulnerable.

32:14.502 --> 32:16.069
Gay guys from your generation

32:16.103 --> 32:18.038
still have all these
pent-up masculinity issues,

32:18.071 --> 32:19.440
and you all just need
to get over it already.

32:19.473 --> 32:21.676
Half the kids in Brian's class
are nonbinary.

32:21.709 --> 32:23.010
Well, it's not fair, Tina.

32:23.043 --> 32:24.646
We had AIDS, and they had <i>Glee.</i>

32:25.713 --> 32:27.615
But there is a work thing

32:27.649 --> 32:29.183
I was thinking of
maybe inviting him to.

32:29.216 --> 32:31.185
- Maybe.
- What, a work thing?

32:31.218 --> 32:33.721
With lots of celebrities
and fancy people?

32:33.755 --> 32:36.023
Now, are you gonna peacock
to impress him?

32:36.056 --> 32:37.357
No. It's just a big fundraiser

32:37.391 --> 32:38.992
for the museum,
and I need to bring someone.

32:39.026 --> 32:40.728
Are you gonna be onstage?

32:40.762 --> 32:43.063
No, I am not going to be
onstage, okay?

32:43.096 --> 32:45.399
I am not some sort of
narcissistic sociopath.

32:45.432 --> 32:48.268
Thank you, Doja Cat.

32:49.403 --> 32:52.740
Everyone, there are
rock paintings in Zimbabwe

32:52.774 --> 32:54.241
which depict homosexuality

32:54.274 --> 32:57.277
that date back to the year
2000 BCE.

32:57.311 --> 32:59.213
If only the men
on those paintings

32:59.246 --> 33:02.282
had lived another 4,000 years
to see a character come out

33:02.316 --> 33:04.619
on <i>It's Always Sunny</i>
<i>in Philadelphia.</i>

33:04.652 --> 33:06.688
Who did your chin?

33:06.721 --> 33:08.288
Oh, no. It's real.

33:08.322 --> 33:09.691
Yeah.

33:09.724 --> 33:11.291
Mine, too.

33:11.325 --> 33:14.127
Please continue to
give generously so the museum

33:14.161 --> 33:15.797
can tell all the stories
in between

33:15.830 --> 33:17.231
that have never been told.

33:17.264 --> 33:19.601
Thank you very much. Good night.

33:23.136 --> 33:24.772
Hey, I'm so sorry
I left you alone.

33:24.806 --> 33:26.273
-Things got a little crazy.
-No.

33:26.306 --> 33:28.141
Hey, dude, you-you were,
you were awesome.

33:28.175 --> 33:29.611
I mean, I could never do that,

33:29.644 --> 33:31.378
-speaking in front of a bunch
of people like that. -Oh.

33:31.411 --> 33:32.647
You move in
some pretty fancy circles.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.214
I had no idea.

33:34.248 --> 33:36.083
Oh, trust me,
it's not always this glamorous.

33:36.116 --> 33:39.086
-Bobby, that was amazing,
as always. -Oh.

33:39.119 --> 33:40.420
-Thank you, Charles.
-Congrats on everything.

33:40.454 --> 33:42.055
Thank you so much.
Thank you for coming.

33:42.089 --> 33:43.156
Thank you.

33:43.190 --> 33:44.626
Great speech, Bobby.

33:44.659 --> 33:46.093
Thank you so much.

33:46.126 --> 33:47.394
Hey, do you want to see
the museum?

33:47.427 --> 33:49.229
-I can give you a private tour.
-Oh, sure.

33:49.263 --> 33:50.598
I-I don't want to drag you
away from all this, though.

33:50.632 --> 33:51.766
Oh, no, it's fine.

33:51.799 --> 33:52.800
- Here. That way.
- Okay.

33:52.834 --> 33:54.368
This is The Legends Pavilion.

33:54.401 --> 33:57.705
Unsung heroes
from LGBTQ+ history.

33:57.739 --> 34:00.675
Marsha P. Johnson
and Sylvia Rivera.

34:00.708 --> 34:02.309
Usually, Stonewall
is the only thing

34:02.342 --> 34:04.378
straight people know
about queer history.

34:04.411 --> 34:05.813
Truthfully, no one really knows

34:05.847 --> 34:07.549
who threw the first bricks
at Stonewall.

34:07.582 --> 34:09.817
But it was trans women of color
like Marsha and Sylvia

34:09.851 --> 34:12.687
who drove the earliest days of
the queer liberation movement.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.556
So what do you think?

34:14.589 --> 34:16.356
It's pretty incredible, right?

34:16.390 --> 34:19.493
Yeah. I mean, it's-it's-it's
really impressive.

34:19.527 --> 34:21.194
But?

34:21.228 --> 34:23.130
But it's kind of depressing.

34:23.163 --> 34:25.232
It's depressing?
It made you depressed?

34:25.265 --> 34:28.570
It's AIDS and Nazis
and homophobia.

34:28.603 --> 34:31.438
All of it's just--
it's kind of a downer.

34:31.471 --> 34:33.173
Okay.
Well, what were you expecting?

34:33.206 --> 34:34.776
<i>A Night at the Museum?</i>

34:34.809 --> 34:36.410
Honestly, my family
loves that movie.

34:36.443 --> 34:37.344
Oh, okay.

34:37.377 --> 34:39.146
Oh, what if you did
something like that?

34:39.179 --> 34:40.782
Where-where the things,
they come alive,

34:40.815 --> 34:42.416
and they, like, talk at you.

34:42.449 --> 34:45.118
"Where the things come alive,
and they talk at you"?

34:45.152 --> 34:46.788
-Yeah.
-Like what exactly? Oh, oh.

34:46.821 --> 34:48.322
What if we had, like,

34:48.355 --> 34:49.657
-a bust of Eleanor Roosevelt,
right? -Yeah.

34:49.691 --> 34:51.358
And you get really close,
and then all of a sudden,

34:51.391 --> 34:53.661
you realize
that's not Eleanor Roosevelt.

34:53.695 --> 34:55.128
It's Amy Schumer.

34:55.162 --> 34:56.463
-Oh.
-No!

34:56.496 --> 34:59.601
It's a museum.
It's not supposed to be fun.

35:00.768 --> 35:02.402
Bobby.

35:02.436 --> 35:04.204
We've got Debra Messing's
agent on a Zoom.

35:04.237 --> 35:05.673
It's urgent.

35:05.707 --> 35:07.875
Debra's worried that she's
on the verge of being canceled.

35:07.909 --> 35:09.510
She said in an interview
that she was

35:09.544 --> 35:11.813
the Viola Davis of Tufts,
and people are mad.

35:11.846 --> 35:13.514
Her agent is saying

35:13.548 --> 35:15.850
that she may give a very big
donation to the museum

35:15.883 --> 35:16.918
to save face.

35:16.951 --> 35:18.853
Who's Debra Messing?

35:18.886 --> 35:20.588
From <i>Will & Grace.</i> Oh, my God.

35:20.622 --> 35:22.422
- Yes.
- Okay, wait. This is amazing.

35:22.456 --> 35:23.891
-Yes. -Stay right here.
I'll be back in five minutes.

35:23.925 --> 35:26.259
-Sure. Yep.
-Let's go. -Okay.

36:05.967 --> 36:07.635
Aaron?

36:09.937 --> 36:11.539
Aaron?

36:17.612 --> 36:19.681
What the fuck?

36:21.949 --> 36:24.952
-Say hi to your brother.
-Sup? -Sup?

36:24.986 --> 36:26.386
Jason's staying here

36:26.420 --> 36:27.689
while he figures out
where to live.

36:27.722 --> 36:29.389
Never get divorced, Aaron.

36:29.423 --> 36:31.291
- Never get married.
- Okay, Mom.

36:31.324 --> 36:33.695
I'm sorry. I'm at work, so
I-I should probably get going.

36:33.728 --> 36:36.463
Oh,
I almost forgot to tell you.

36:36.496 --> 36:38.432
Do you remember Josh Evans?

36:38.465 --> 36:39.967
Yeah, Josh Evans
from high school.

36:40.001 --> 36:41.903
I actually ran into him
and his fiancée

36:41.936 --> 36:43.437
on the street the other day.

36:43.470 --> 36:46.239
Well, they just broke up.
And you want to know why?

36:46.273 --> 36:48.375
Because he's gay.

36:49.744 --> 36:51.879
Josh Ev-- No.

36:51.913 --> 36:53.581
I'm definitely embarrassed

36:53.614 --> 36:55.348
about how long
this has taken me,

36:55.382 --> 36:58.452
but I'm told people do this
in their own time.

36:58.485 --> 37:01.622
I've been empowered by my hero,
Colton Underwood,

37:01.656 --> 37:05.593
to say that, as it turns out,
I'm gay.

37:06.594 --> 37:08.896
And like this post
if you like that I'm gay.

37:08.930 --> 37:10.898
Peace.

37:10.932 --> 37:13.333
Holy shit.

37:13.366 --> 37:16.303
So we started going
back and forth for a while,

37:16.336 --> 37:17.672
and then at the end,
I was just like,

37:17.705 --> 37:19.640
"Why don't you call the album
<i>Lemonade?"</i>

37:22.309 --> 37:23.845
Bobby?

37:23.878 --> 37:25.278
When you're ready.

37:25.312 --> 37:27.648
-What?
-When you're ready.

37:27.682 --> 37:28.850
Sorry.

37:28.883 --> 37:30.752
Okay. People wonder

37:30.785 --> 37:33.320
if America is ready
for its first gay president.

37:33.353 --> 37:35.890
I say we already had one.

37:35.923 --> 37:37.725
For the final wing,
please consider

37:37.759 --> 37:41.361
The Lincoln Letters:
A Gay American Love Story.

37:41.394 --> 37:42.897
For years, historians have

37:42.930 --> 37:44.732
speculated about
Lincoln's sexuality.

37:44.766 --> 37:47.367
He shared a bed and
exchanged intimate letters with

37:47.400 --> 37:50.370
multiple men over the years,
including Joshua Speed

37:50.403 --> 37:51.806
-and David Derrickson. Speed...
-Okay, I'm stopping you.

37:51.839 --> 37:54.509
Bobby, it won't work.
You can't say Lincoln was gay.

37:54.542 --> 37:56.911
-Why?
-There's no way to confirm

37:56.944 --> 37:58.513
those were sexual relationships.

37:58.546 --> 38:00.347
There's no evidence of love.

38:00.380 --> 38:02.315
Well, of course there's
no evidence of love, Robert.

38:02.349 --> 38:03.483
We weren't allowed to exist.

38:03.518 --> 38:05.418
How would we have
enough evidence?

38:05.452 --> 38:07.922
Okay, Lincoln was married to
a woman and had four children.

38:07.955 --> 38:09.991
He was not gay, Bobby.

38:10.024 --> 38:11.424
He might have been bi.

38:11.458 --> 38:12.760
I am telling you!

38:12.794 --> 38:14.796
We have let the world
erase gay love stories

38:14.829 --> 38:16.063
since the beginning of time.

38:16.097 --> 38:18.833
This is our chance
to reject the shame

38:18.866 --> 38:20.400
and restore the truth.

38:20.433 --> 38:21.836
And if we don't do this,
we're letting them win.

38:21.869 --> 38:24.071
We're letting the
heterosexual terrorists win.

38:24.105 --> 38:25.640
The heterosexual terrorists?

38:25.673 --> 38:28.042
-That's right.
-There are also gay terrorists.

38:28.075 --> 38:29.944
And there are
bi terrorists, okay?

38:29.977 --> 38:32.479
There are
many bisexual terrorists.

38:32.513 --> 38:33.714
Okay, there are
trans terrorists, too.

38:33.748 --> 38:35.482
Caitlyn Jenner.

38:35.516 --> 38:37.518
Enough, people.
Let's vote on it.

38:39.821 --> 38:41.122
Okay.

38:41.155 --> 38:43.624
Looks like we have two votes

38:43.658 --> 38:45.760
for The Great Bisexuals
of the World.

38:45.793 --> 38:47.128
Thank you, someone.

38:47.161 --> 38:48.563
And three votes
for The Lincoln Letters.

38:48.596 --> 38:49.997
-Lincoln wins.
-Yes!

38:50.031 --> 38:52.600
Thank you! Thank you.

38:52.633 --> 38:55.036
Debra Messing is
in the building.

38:56.604 --> 38:58.773
Yes! My girl.

38:58.806 --> 38:59.974
Are you okay?

39:00.007 --> 39:01.075
-Yeah.
-Debra Messing.

39:01.108 --> 39:02.777
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

39:02.810 --> 39:05.580
Okay. Wish me luck.

39:06.547 --> 39:09.650
-Miss Messing.
-Oh, please call me Debra.

39:09.684 --> 39:11.118
-Oh.
-Oh.

39:11.152 --> 39:12.954
I love this space.

39:12.987 --> 39:14.889
How did you find it?

39:14.922 --> 39:16.991
Oh, God. How did we find it?

39:17.024 --> 39:19.660
Um, I don't know. I'm sorry.

39:19.694 --> 39:22.063
Are you okay, dear?
You seem a little flustered.

39:22.096 --> 39:23.598
Trust me.

39:23.631 --> 39:26.734
I know I'm Debra Messing,
but I'm only human.

39:26.767 --> 39:28.002
Right.

39:28.035 --> 39:29.469
Um, no, I'm fine.

39:29.503 --> 39:31.471
It's a-- I'm so sorry.
It's boy problems.

39:31.505 --> 39:32.472
It's nothing. It's stupid.

39:32.506 --> 39:34.108
-Oh.
-Yeah.

39:34.141 --> 39:35.475
He was actually here last night.

39:35.509 --> 39:36.744
He came to
the fundraiser with me,

39:36.777 --> 39:38.579
and then out of nowhere,
he left, you know.

39:38.613 --> 39:39.614
And I keep texting him,
and he doesn't text me back.

39:39.647 --> 39:41.148
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

39:41.182 --> 39:43.751
-How are you?
-I am so excited for this tour.

39:43.784 --> 39:44.986
Can I just ask you
really quickly?

39:45.019 --> 39:46.453
Because I actually think

39:46.486 --> 39:48.055
you're, like,
the perfect person to ask.

39:48.089 --> 39:49.590
What is going on?

39:49.624 --> 39:51.424
You know, like,
is he not interested in me

39:51.458 --> 39:53.160
or did something really come up?

39:53.194 --> 39:54.629
And why am I
thinking about it so much?

39:54.662 --> 39:56.097
That's what's so annoying.

39:56.130 --> 39:58.032
You know, because I'm never
distracted like this, okay?

39:58.065 --> 39:59.033
This is not who I am.

39:59.066 --> 40:00.501
And it's like, what do I do now?

40:00.534 --> 40:02.469
Do I text him again?
Do I call him?

40:02.503 --> 40:05.039
Do I go to his house, you know?

40:05.072 --> 40:07.041
What do I do, Debra?

40:07.074 --> 40:09.810
You know, for the last 25 years,

40:09.844 --> 40:13.180
I have been listening
to every gay man on earth

40:13.214 --> 40:14.849
complain to me.

40:14.882 --> 40:16.083
I am not my character.

40:16.117 --> 40:18.619
I am not every gay man's
best friend.

40:18.653 --> 40:21.055
I am simply out in the world,

40:21.088 --> 40:25.059
thinking that I'm gonna get
a tour of a museum, but no. No!

40:25.092 --> 40:28.796
Did I waltz in here
and lay all my shit on you?

40:28.829 --> 40:31.933
-Answer me! Answer me!
-I'm just-- I...

40:31.966 --> 40:33.067
Shut up!

40:33.100 --> 40:34.669
I am a divorced single mother.

40:34.702 --> 40:36.469
You want to hear
what that's like?

40:36.504 --> 40:38.205
I'm so sorry about this.
I'm terribly embarrassed.

40:38.239 --> 40:39.840
Please let me,
let me start again. I...

40:39.874 --> 40:42.475
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wh-What's going on in here?

40:42.510 --> 40:43.711
Do you have some personal shit

40:43.744 --> 40:45.146
you want to complain
to me about?

40:45.179 --> 40:46.847
-No.
-Of course not.

40:46.881 --> 40:51.686
Because lesbians
have their shit together.

40:51.719 --> 40:53.955
I got to go.
I lose my sitter in an hour.

40:53.988 --> 40:55.790
Miss Messing, please come back.
I'm so sorry.

40:55.823 --> 40:59.927
I am not Grace!

40:59.961 --> 41:01.963
It is a character.

41:01.996 --> 41:04.598
I won an Emmy for it.

41:04.632 --> 41:06.934
I even beat
Sarah Jessica Parker.

41:06.968 --> 41:08.869
People forget!

41:08.903 --> 41:10.838
I'm shaving my head.

41:10.871 --> 41:12.974
What the fuck
is this doing here?

41:13.007 --> 41:15.176
Bobby!
What is going on with you?

41:15.209 --> 41:17.144
Debra Messing
just told you to fuck off.

41:17.178 --> 41:18.779
The door's fucking locked.

41:18.813 --> 41:21.816
-Oh, please let me help you.
-No. I want her.

Oh, come on.

42:55.376 --> 42:57.812
<i>Sure.</i>

43:03.651 --> 43:05.219
Why are you sitting on the grass

43:05.252 --> 43:07.054
and not this gigantic blanket?

43:08.989 --> 43:11.158
I like grass.

43:11.192 --> 43:13.961
Mm. Cool. Cool.

43:19.934 --> 43:22.002
So what's up?

43:22.036 --> 43:24.305
-What's been going on?
-Oh, wait.

43:24.338 --> 43:25.673
Crazy story.

43:25.706 --> 43:27.108
Remember that guy I ran into,

43:27.141 --> 43:28.375
that old buddy from high school?

43:28.409 --> 43:30.845
-Yeah.
-Yeah. He just came out.

43:30.878 --> 43:31.779
What?

43:31.812 --> 43:33.714
Broke up with his fiancée.
I had no idea.

43:33.747 --> 43:36.050
-Wow.
-Crazy.

43:36.083 --> 43:37.218
-Good for him.
-Yeah.

43:37.251 --> 43:39.120
That's cool.

43:41.222 --> 43:43.757
Very cool.

43:47.862 --> 43:49.697
Okay, I'm sorry.
What is going on?

43:49.730 --> 43:52.266
-What do you mean?
-The other night.

43:52.299 --> 43:53.734
Leaving me at the museum
like that.

43:53.767 --> 43:55.269
And then you didn't return
any of my texts.

43:55.302 --> 43:56.704
Well, you texted me
like 15 times.

43:56.737 --> 43:57.905
It was a little scary.

43:57.938 --> 43:59.974
Okay, I need you
to be honest with me.

44:00.007 --> 44:01.742
You're not attracted
to me, right?

44:01.775 --> 44:03.144
It's okay. I can handle it.

44:03.177 --> 44:04.278
I won't be insulted.

44:04.311 --> 44:05.846
I just need to know.

44:05.880 --> 44:07.281
Just be honest with me
so I don't waste my time.

44:07.314 --> 44:10.317
-I'm not your type, right?
-Bobby, it's not that.

44:10.351 --> 44:13.053
-You are a very attractive guy.
-Okay. Well, thanks.

44:13.087 --> 44:15.923
So why are you being so weird
and passive-aggressive?

44:15.956 --> 44:17.725
Look, you're being
very loud, actually.

44:17.758 --> 44:19.860
-You like dumb guys.
-What?

44:19.894 --> 44:22.429
Yeah, you heard me.
I see what you like.

44:22.463 --> 44:25.399
You like these big,
like, fucking bro-ey,

44:25.432 --> 44:27.067
like, meathead idiots.

44:27.101 --> 44:30.037
Oh, is that
what you like, Aaron? Yeah?

44:30.070 --> 44:32.439
-You want to play with
the big boys, huh? -Yep.

44:32.473 --> 44:34.074
Oh, look, Aaron,
they're fighting.

44:34.108 --> 44:36.010
-You want to be in the fight?
-Yeah, that's right.

44:36.043 --> 44:37.444
You want to be back in the old
high school locker room, huh?

44:37.478 --> 44:39.180
-Yeah.
-With your hockey friends,

44:39.213 --> 44:42.449
like, stealing a glance
at fucking Josh, right?

44:42.483 --> 44:44.018
- Huh? Yeah, you like that?
- Okay.

44:44.051 --> 44:44.785
Hey.

44:44.818 --> 44:46.387
-Yeah, I can be tough.
-Oh, wow.

44:46.420 --> 44:48.055
Yeah, I can be tough
like your boys.

44:48.088 --> 44:49.990
-You stop that. -Yeah.
Oh, that's what you like, huh?

44:50.024 --> 44:51.258
-Oh, now you're on
my blanket, bro. -Yeah, okay.

44:51.292 --> 44:52.793
Yeah, get on my blanket, bro.

44:52.826 --> 44:53.928
-Oh, now I'm on your blanket.
-Oh, now you want

44:53.961 --> 44:55.329
-on my big blanket?
-Yeah.

44:55.362 --> 44:56.797
Now you want to be
on my big blanket?

44:56.830 --> 44:58.199
I can be aggressive.
Oh, there you are.

44:58.232 --> 45:00.234
-There you-- I can...
-Yeah? Yeah, yeah?

45:00.267 --> 45:02.002
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?

45:02.036 --> 45:03.337
-I'm all over
your blanket. -Yeah?

45:03.370 --> 45:05.005
Boys?

45:05.839 --> 45:08.309
-Okay, man.
-Oh, yeah. -My bad.

45:09.843 --> 45:11.478

Oh, yeah. Dirty. Oh, yeah.

45:36.504 --> 45:38.772
Oh, yeah.

45:42.142 --> 45:44.178
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?

45:44.211 --> 45:45.813
Uh-huh.

45:45.846 --> 45:47.481
-Mm-hmm. You like that?
-Yeah. Yes.

45:47.515 --> 45:49.383
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. Okay.

45:49.416 --> 45:51.819
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

45:51.852 --> 45:54.421
Yeah. Okay.

45:54.455 --> 45:55.889
- Good? Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

45:55.923 --> 45:57.324
Ooh, yeah. Oh, yeah?

45:57.358 --> 45:59.026
-You gonna tap out?
-Yeah, yeah, I'll tap out.

45:59.059 --> 46:00.861
-Yeah? Oh, yeah. Yeah?
-I'll tap out.

46:00.894 --> 46:02.196
-You gonna tap out? Tap out.
-I'll tap out.

46:02.229 --> 46:04.064
-I tap out!
-Are you good? Are you good?

46:04.098 --> 46:06.501
-I tapped out. I tapped out.
-Okay, I'm sorry. Okay.

46:08.335 --> 46:09.470
Oh.

46:09.504 --> 46:11.272
Oh! Oh.

46:11.305 --> 46:13.541
-Great. Yeah, you like that?
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

46:13.575 --> 46:15.309
Yeah, you like that?
Yeah, you like that?

46:15.342 --> 46:18.045
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-You like that? You like that?

46:18.078 --> 46:19.480
-Oh, yeah. You like that?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

46:19.514 --> 46:20.848
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah. Yeah.

46:20.881 --> 46:22.249
You like poppers?

46:22.283 --> 46:23.417
-Yeah.
-Okay.

46:23.450 --> 46:25.786
♪ My heart ♪

46:28.956 --> 46:32.026
♪ And the moment ♪

46:32.059 --> 46:35.062
♪ I can feel that ♪

46:36.330 --> 46:41.268
♪ You feel that way, too ♪

46:42.236 --> 46:45.205
♪ Is when I fall in love ♪

46:47.107 --> 46:49.376
♪ With you. ♪

46:58.385 --> 47:00.921
That was crazy.

47:00.954 --> 47:03.057
Yeah.

47:08.162 --> 47:11.231
I like how your chest
goes in like that.

47:11.265 --> 47:13.601
Oh, thank you.

47:13.635 --> 47:16.136
Mm, it's called a concave chest.

47:16.170 --> 47:18.439
Well, I like it.

47:18.472 --> 47:21.008
It's like a tiny birdbath.

47:21.975 --> 47:23.377
It's like a birdbath?

47:23.410 --> 47:25.346
-Mm.
-Great.

47:25.379 --> 47:26.548
I always wanted my chest

47:26.581 --> 47:28.182
to look exactly like
a tiny birdbath.

47:28.215 --> 47:30.484
It's what every man wants.

47:33.521 --> 47:35.089
I like how hairy you are.

47:35.122 --> 47:37.525
You're like Austin Powers.

47:38.693 --> 47:40.361
Thank you.

47:42.196 --> 47:44.264
God, I never thought
I would date someone who gets

47:44.298 --> 47:48.302
more excited about Austin
Powers than Debra Messing.

47:48.335 --> 47:51.004
Where did I go wrong?

47:51.038 --> 47:53.273
Wait. Are-are we dating?

47:56.176 --> 47:58.312
No.

47:58.345 --> 48:00.347
We're not dating. Please.

48:00.381 --> 48:01.949
I was joking.

48:01.982 --> 48:04.284
You don't date people.
I don't date people.

48:04.318 --> 48:06.387
We don't date people.

48:07.555 --> 48:09.957
-Remember?
-I remember.

48:12.660 --> 48:15.262
Ow. What are you doing?

48:27.040 --> 48:29.143
So annoying how good
a warm body feels

48:29.176 --> 48:31.945
laying on another warm body.

48:42.990 --> 48:47.060
-Hmm? -I hate getting
work emails on a Sunday.

48:48.663 --> 48:50.532
Your job is really intense.

48:50.565 --> 48:52.933
Yes, and I hate it.

48:53.735 --> 48:56.036
It's fucking stressful
and depressing

48:56.069 --> 48:58.740
and so fucking boring. I-I...

48:58.773 --> 49:01.543
I fucking hate it.

49:01.576 --> 49:03.444
I'm sorry.

49:03.477 --> 49:06.548
Was there something else
you wanted to do?

49:08.683 --> 49:11.418
Bobby, I need
to tell you something.

49:16.624 --> 49:19.059
When I was younger...

49:22.262 --> 49:24.998
-What happened?
-I...

49:27.502 --> 49:30.237
You can tell me.

49:34.509 --> 49:38.412
When I was younger, I wanted
to make little chocolates.

49:41.048 --> 49:42.717
You wanted to make...

49:42.750 --> 49:44.284
-little chocolates?
-Yes.

49:44.318 --> 49:46.220
I used to tell my parents
I was going to the arcade

49:46.253 --> 49:48.322
at the mall, but
I would sneak off to Godiva.

49:48.355 --> 49:51.258
I just loved how all
the chocolates were wrapped.

49:51.291 --> 49:53.628
And I thought about how I would
design my own chocolates,

49:53.661 --> 49:55.162
how each little chocolate has

49:55.195 --> 49:57.231
its own specific,
unique design on it,

49:57.264 --> 49:58.533
and that little design tells you

49:58.566 --> 50:00.200
what they're gonna taste like.

50:00.234 --> 50:04.606
So I would draw my own
chocolates in-in a notepad.

50:04.639 --> 50:06.240
It's all I thought about.

50:06.273 --> 50:08.676
Tiny little pretty chocolates.

50:08.710 --> 50:10.377
That's good.

50:10.410 --> 50:12.514
What was I gonna do
with that, though?

50:12.547 --> 50:14.414
What was I gonna be?

50:15.717 --> 50:17.251
A chocolatier?

50:17.284 --> 50:20.187
Bobby, I wasn't gonna be
a fucking chocolatier.

50:20.220 --> 50:22.256
I don't know. Why not?

50:22.289 --> 50:24.057
It seemed kind of faggy.

50:24.091 --> 50:26.594
Oh, my God, Aaron.

50:26.628 --> 50:27.829
Faggy?

50:27.862 --> 50:29.764
It's not faggy
to spend your life

50:29.797 --> 50:31.265
making pretty little chocolates.

50:31.298 --> 50:33.133
-Bobby.
-Okay, fine.

50:33.166 --> 50:35.135
But so what?
So you're a big fag.

50:35.168 --> 50:36.436
So am I. It's great.

50:36.470 --> 50:38.338
Did you not realize that
a few minutes ago

50:38.372 --> 50:40.374
when you were sticking
your enormous penis

50:40.407 --> 50:42.476
- into my tiny anus?
- Okay, yeah.

50:42.510 --> 50:44.546
It-It's kind of cliché,
don't you think?

50:44.579 --> 50:48.282
I'd rather be a cliché
than be miserable.

50:48.315 --> 50:50.284
Well, my 15-year-old brain
in 1995--

50:50.317 --> 50:52.587
that is all I thought about.

50:53.588 --> 50:55.690
That was right around the time

50:55.723 --> 50:56.824
that my brother caught me.

50:56.858 --> 50:58.191
-Hooking up with a guy?
-No.

50:58.225 --> 51:00.595
No, I was making
little chocolates.

51:00.628 --> 51:02.462
Oh.

51:02.496 --> 51:05.465
I lied, and I said
that I was...

51:05.499 --> 51:07.301
making chocolates for this girl

51:07.334 --> 51:09.303
that I had a crush on at school.

51:09.336 --> 51:10.437
I'm sorry.

51:10.470 --> 51:12.540
This is the cutest thing
I've ever heard.

51:12.574 --> 51:14.842
I guess you just have
this big, exciting life.

51:14.876 --> 51:19.379
I just didn't want you to think
that I was some boring schlub.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.149
I don't think you're boring.

51:22.182 --> 51:23.818
Your friend said I was boring.

51:23.851 --> 51:27.154
Oh, my God.
You were mad about that?

51:27.187 --> 51:29.724
I was joking. I'm sorry.

51:29.757 --> 51:31.458
But, like, I don't understand.

51:31.491 --> 51:33.528
You don't have to be stuck in
that miserable office all day.

51:33.561 --> 51:36.163
You could be out in the world,
I don't know,

51:36.196 --> 51:38.198
making fudge, you know?

51:38.231 --> 51:40.735
You're like a Keebler elf
with internalized homophobia.

51:40.768 --> 51:42.135
You have to do this.

51:42.169 --> 51:43.538
You have to become
a chocolatier.

51:43.571 --> 51:45.807
-Oh, Bobby. -You have to become
a chocolatier.

51:45.840 --> 51:46.908
I'm telling you.

51:46.941 --> 51:49.510
You make that sound so easy.

51:49.544 --> 51:51.211
Well, no, it's not easy.

51:51.244 --> 51:53.347
Nothing's easy.

51:53.380 --> 51:55.650
My God. You know what
I have to do this weekend?

51:55.683 --> 51:57.619
I have to drag my concave chest

51:57.652 --> 51:59.687
up to Provincetown
and beg donors for money.

51:59.721 --> 52:03.423
I need $5 million
or else the museum can't open.

52:03.457 --> 52:06.226
And it's Pride up there,
so the museum has to have

52:06.259 --> 52:08.195
a float in the parade,
and that's a whole thing.

52:08.228 --> 52:11.264
I'm telling you, it is not easy.

52:11.298 --> 52:12.667
It is never easy.

52:15.536 --> 52:16.704
But it's worth it.

52:18.238 --> 52:20.207
Hey, maybe I can come.

52:21.576 --> 52:23.711
To where?

52:23.745 --> 52:25.278
Provincetown?

52:26.446 --> 52:27.615
Oh.

52:28.616 --> 52:29.917
Yeah.

52:37.290 --> 52:40.293
Come, come, come.
Welcome. I'm Louis.

52:40.327 --> 52:41.896
Let me show you your bedroom.

52:41.929 --> 52:43.397
Thank you. Oh, my God.

52:43.430 --> 52:45.265
-This house is so beautiful.
-Oh.

52:45.298 --> 52:46.701
How long have you had
this place?

52:46.734 --> 52:49.804
Oh, I've been coming up
to P-town since, uh, 1976.

52:49.837 --> 52:51.572
-Wow.
-Who are all these guys?

52:51.606 --> 52:54.274
Oh, well, um, actually,
that's me.

52:54.307 --> 52:56.276
Oh, my God.

52:56.309 --> 52:57.912
Louis, you were so hot.

52:57.945 --> 52:59.681
-Yeah, I know.
-Wow.

52:59.714 --> 53:01.649
Do any of these guys
still come up here, too?

53:01.683 --> 53:03.283
Uh, no.

53:03.316 --> 53:06.721
By 1996, four of the seven
of them were gone.

53:06.754 --> 53:09.991
I got this place in 1999
when I realized that somehow,

53:10.024 --> 53:11.993
miraculously,
I was gonna survive.

53:12.026 --> 53:13.493
Oh, I'm so sorry.

53:13.528 --> 53:15.596
So, tell me.
What are you boys up to today?

53:15.630 --> 53:17.965
Oh, well, I have a work thing
this afternoon,

53:17.999 --> 53:19.567
so I don't really know.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.669
-Probably just lay low.
-Lay low?

53:21.703 --> 53:22.970
You're in P-town.

53:23.004 --> 53:24.572
Go out. Have fun.

53:24.605 --> 53:26.541
You'll be dead soon enough.
Come on.

53:26.574 --> 53:28.943
- Let me show you to your room.
- All right.

53:28.976 --> 53:30.310
Here's your bedroom.

53:30.343 --> 53:31.979
Oh, my God!

53:32.013 --> 53:34.281
Oh, wow.

53:34.314 --> 53:36.283
And if you want to fuck,
you let me know.

53:36.818 --> 53:39.319
-Oh. Mm.
-Mm.

53:41.689 --> 53:43.858
Hey, I need to grab something.
Oh, shit.

53:43.891 --> 53:44.992
-Bobby.
-I'm sorry.

53:45.026 --> 53:46.493
Why are you just
walking in here?

53:46.527 --> 53:47.995
I'm sorry. I thought
you were in the shower.

53:48.029 --> 53:50.464
It's not steroids.
It's just testosterone.

53:50.497 --> 53:52.265
Isn't that dangerous, like,

53:52.299 --> 53:53.534
for your liver and balls
and stuff?

53:53.568 --> 53:55.770
No. Half the guys I know
do this stuff.

53:55.803 --> 53:58.740
Yeah, but half the guys
you know are roided-out morons.

53:58.773 --> 54:00.474
Yeah, well, that doesn't
seem to bother you

54:00.508 --> 54:02.710
when you're obsessing
over my body.

54:07.081 --> 54:08.683
Okay, that's fair.

54:08.716 --> 54:10.551
Um, I'm gonna shower.

54:13.320 --> 54:14.956
♪ She's taken my heart ♪

54:14.989 --> 54:19.894
♪ But she doesn't know
what she's done ♪

54:19.927 --> 54:23.898
♪ I feel
her breath in my face ♪

54:23.931 --> 54:27.935
♪ Her body close to me ♪

54:27.969 --> 54:32.039
♪ Can't look in her eyes ♪

54:32.073 --> 54:36.644
♪ She's out of my league ♪

54:36.677 --> 54:41.783
♪ Just a fool to believe
I have anything she needs ♪

54:42.950 --> 54:45.753
♪ She's like the wind. ♪

54:46.554 --> 54:48.723
You have a really nice voice.

54:48.756 --> 54:49.924
What?

54:49.957 --> 54:51.324
I heard you singing
in the shower.

54:51.358 --> 54:53.561
Well, that's mortifying.

54:53.594 --> 54:55.563
Wait, so you're asking
this guy to donate

54:55.596 --> 54:57.397
the remaining five million?

54:57.430 --> 54:59.867
No. If I can get one million
out of him, I'll take it.

54:59.901 --> 55:02.537
You can't scare these people
off by seeming too needy.

55:02.570 --> 55:05.372
Kind of like with you.

55:05.405 --> 55:07.708
-Who's Lawrence Grape?
-Larry Grape.

55:07.742 --> 55:09.710
Biggest gay TV producer
on the planet.

55:09.744 --> 55:11.979
He's made all this
groundbreaking queer content.

55:12.013 --> 55:13.848
He's major.

55:13.881 --> 55:15.382
Mr. Grape, I'm thinking

55:15.415 --> 55:16.951
the final wing
should be about Lincoln.

55:16.984 --> 55:18.953
Love that. Love Lincoln.

55:18.986 --> 55:20.855
Very few people know this,

55:20.888 --> 55:21.989
but our most popular president

55:22.023 --> 55:23.356
was also
our first gay president.

55:23.390 --> 55:24.959
Sorry. This is a Lincoln museum?

55:24.992 --> 55:26.761
Is this a Lincoln museum, sir?

55:26.794 --> 55:29.630
This is actually
an LGBTQ history museum.

55:29.664 --> 55:31.431
It's the first of its kind
on a national level.

55:31.464 --> 55:32.465
We actually s...

55:32.499 --> 55:34.735
That fucking bush! Come on.

55:34.769 --> 55:36.469
My neighbors planted that bush,
and it blocks my view.

55:36.504 --> 55:37.738
Can you believe that?

55:39.140 --> 55:40.741
Let's go take care of this.

55:41.709 --> 55:42.977
Oh, again with this?
What are you doing?

55:43.010 --> 55:44.145
This is on my property, Maurice!

55:44.178 --> 55:45.847
This is a shared borderline!

55:45.880 --> 55:47.815
This is a fucking disaster.
He won't even listen to me.

55:47.849 --> 55:49.650
He's too busy getting
his rottweiler ready for Pride.

55:49.684 --> 55:51.819
Okay, from my experience
at my job,

55:51.853 --> 55:54.088
weird rich people
just want to be listened to.

55:54.121 --> 55:55.723
Ask him what he's interested in.

55:55.756 --> 55:57.024
But I don't care
what he's interested in.

55:57.058 --> 55:58.626
I'm here to pitch him my idea.

55:58.659 --> 56:00.795
Well, then pretend like
you're interested.

56:00.828 --> 56:01.996
Just do a listening face.

56:02.029 --> 56:04.031
-Do a listening face?
-Yeah.

56:04.065 --> 56:07.034
Hmm. Yeah.

56:07.068 --> 56:09.103
- I can't.
- Yes. Come on. Go.

56:09.136 --> 56:10.771
Okay.

56:12.506 --> 56:13.908
-Yes. Yeah, that's good.
-Really?

56:13.941 --> 56:15.076
That looked like I'm listening?

56:15.109 --> 56:16.143
-Totally. Yeah.
-Oh.

56:16.177 --> 56:17.678
...plant this on my property!

56:17.712 --> 56:19.513
-It's an indigenous bush!
-Are you going to Pride?

56:19.547 --> 56:20.715
-Of course.
-I'll see you there.

56:20.748 --> 56:22.617
-Love you.
-Oh, I love you, too.

56:22.650 --> 56:24.652
All right. Listening.
I'll try it. I'll try it.

56:24.685 --> 56:26.053
Sorry.
I have to get going, boys.

56:26.087 --> 56:27.922
Oh, Mr. Grape,
let me ask you something.

56:27.955 --> 56:30.157
Um...

56:30.191 --> 56:35.428
what would you like to see
in the museum?

56:36.230 --> 56:38.799
A haunted house

56:38.833 --> 56:41.135
of gay trauma.

56:41.168 --> 56:42.803
A haunted house of gay trauma?

56:42.837 --> 56:45.206
Yeah. It's a cart on a track,
and there's...

56:45.239 --> 56:47.440
I'm sorry. This is a ride?

56:47.474 --> 56:49.476
Yeah, it's a fucking ride!

56:49.510 --> 56:51.579
So you think
a ride is too much?

56:52.179 --> 56:54.515
Um, no. N-No.

56:54.548 --> 56:57.551
No, no, no, no. It's perfect.
Please, keep going.

56:57.585 --> 56:59.520
Okay. We find ourselves in

56:59.553 --> 57:02.924
an intimate little bar
with some young,

57:02.957 --> 57:04.759
hot, animatronic men.

57:04.792 --> 57:07.194
The men turn to dance with each
other when suddenly-- Boom!

57:07.228 --> 57:08.495
Oh, my...

57:08.529 --> 57:10.064
A cop car
smashes through the wall.

57:10.097 --> 57:11.899
Police storm out of the cars.

57:11.933 --> 57:14.702
There's sirens and batons
and voices screaming.

57:14.735 --> 57:16.604
And suddenly, the car takes off
like a roller coaster,

57:16.637 --> 57:18.072
and there's blood everywhere.

57:18.105 --> 57:21.609
And a monster with Reagan's
face on it is chasing you

57:21.642 --> 57:23.577
down the hallway saying,
"Shining city on a hill.

57:23.611 --> 57:24.946
Shining city on a hill."

57:24.979 --> 57:26.981
And then...
we shoot out into the light.

57:27.014 --> 57:28.783
And it ends on something happy

57:28.816 --> 57:31.953
like Lil Nas X working out
with pink dumbbells.

57:33.254 --> 57:34.956
Wow.

57:34.989 --> 57:37.525
Um, a gay trauma coaster.

57:37.558 --> 57:39.961
I-I mean,
it's-it's very provocative.

57:39.994 --> 57:41.262
I just don't think we can afford

57:41.295 --> 57:42.964
that sort of thing,
unfortunately.

57:42.997 --> 57:45.199
Right. Well, okay, it was
so lovely meeting you g...

57:45.232 --> 57:47.635
Mr. Grape, Mr. Grape.

57:47.668 --> 57:49.236
I'm not a creative guy.
I'm a money guy.

57:49.270 --> 57:50.905
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-I-- No, no.

57:50.938 --> 57:53.574
I can tell you,
to accomplish what you want,

57:53.607 --> 57:55.676
we need more than
just a little donation.

57:55.710 --> 57:58.713
-No, Aaron...
-We need $5 million.

57:58.746 --> 58:00.715
And you won't just get
the gay trauma coaster.

58:00.748 --> 58:02.783
You get the Lincoln exhibit.
You get all of it.

58:02.817 --> 58:08.823
You rewrite history
for an entire LGBTQ community.

58:08.856 --> 58:13.828
You're a storyteller, Lawrence,
and this is the ultimate story.

58:16.731 --> 58:18.299
You already pushed
the museum opening back twice.

58:18.332 --> 58:19.867
Is it really happening?

58:19.900 --> 58:21.936
Yes! It's definitely happening.
I promise.

58:21.969 --> 58:24.305
My entire life
has led up to this.

58:24.338 --> 58:27.608
Right, well,
$5 million is nothing

58:27.641 --> 58:28.843
to rewrite history.

58:28.876 --> 58:29.877
I'm in.

58:29.910 --> 58:31.312
Wait, really?

58:31.345 --> 58:33.781
-Yes! Yes! -Oh, my God!
Mr. Grape, thank you!

58:33.814 --> 58:35.016
Of course.

58:35.049 --> 58:37.651
Congratulations on my money.
Happy Pride.

58:37.685 --> 58:39.220
-Happy Pride!
-Now I have to go

58:39.253 --> 58:42.823
to a Pride party, and you're
both too old to be in the pool.

58:42.857 --> 58:44.025
Please leave.

58:46.360 --> 58:49.030
Aaron! Oh, my God!

58:49.063 --> 58:50.598
You're a genius.

58:50.631 --> 58:51.932
"You're a storyteller"?

58:51.966 --> 58:53.601
-Where did that even come from?
-I told you.

58:53.634 --> 58:54.869
I'm good at talking
to weird rich folk.

58:54.902 --> 58:56.704
I could tell
he had money to spend.

58:56.737 --> 58:58.339
I-I don't know what to say.

58:58.372 --> 58:59.740
Thank you.

58:59.774 --> 59:01.175
Sure.

59:01.208 --> 59:02.943
Oh, my God.

59:02.977 --> 59:04.612
Oh, shit!
I got to go to the parade.

59:04.645 --> 59:05.846
I got to get on
that stupid float.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.948
-I'll see you after.
-Okay.

59:07.982 --> 59:09.884
Okay. Thank you.

59:17.825 --> 59:18.826
Okay.

59:20.628 --> 59:21.996
I kissed you!

59:22.029 --> 59:24.365
Are we kissing each other now?
I don't know! Bye!

59:35.376 --> 59:37.578
Bobby!

1:00:11.679 --> 1:00:13.747
You're gorgeous.

1:00:14.381 --> 1:00:16.617
What? You are.

1:00:19.153 --> 1:00:21.989
I still can't believe what
you did with Lawrence today.

1:00:22.022 --> 1:00:24.024
That was amazing!

1:00:24.058 --> 1:00:25.726
$5 million?

1:00:25.759 --> 1:00:27.328
It's not that big a deal.

1:00:27.361 --> 1:00:30.030
It is a huge deal.
Are you kidding me?

1:00:30.064 --> 1:00:32.700
I always have to do
everything for myself.

1:00:32.733 --> 1:00:35.002
No one ever does shit
like that for me.

1:00:35.035 --> 1:00:38.339
You know, what you did for me
you could do for yourself.

1:00:38.372 --> 1:00:40.341
Open a chocolate shop.
I don't know.

1:00:40.374 --> 1:00:43.144
I'm not opening
a chocolate shop.

1:00:43.177 --> 1:00:45.446
I'm not as confident as you.

1:00:45.479 --> 1:00:47.748
Oh, please.
I'm not that confident.

1:00:47.781 --> 1:00:50.217
You are the most confident
person I know,

1:00:50.251 --> 1:00:52.153
like, to a fault.

1:00:52.186 --> 1:00:53.354
It's actually--

1:00:53.387 --> 1:00:55.022
It's kind of scary.

1:00:56.891 --> 1:00:59.727
Trust me, it's all an act.

1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:01.729
Confidence is
just a choice you make.

1:01:01.762 --> 1:01:03.430
It's a decision like any other.

1:01:03.464 --> 1:01:05.866
Usually born out of necessity.

1:01:06.767 --> 1:01:08.836
You think I have
a good singing voice now?

1:01:08.869 --> 1:01:10.704
You should have heard me
when I was a kid.

1:01:10.738 --> 1:01:11.972
I was even better.

1:01:12.006 --> 1:01:13.774
Had <i>American Idol</i> existed then,

1:01:13.807 --> 1:01:15.376
I would've been the gay guy
with an amazing voice

1:01:15.409 --> 1:01:16.744
who comes in second.

1:01:16.777 --> 1:01:18.779
And then let's see.

1:01:18.812 --> 1:01:24.084
Then I went to college, and
my musical theater teacher--

1:01:24.118 --> 1:01:26.387
he told me that I had
a "gay walk"

1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:31.458
and a "flamboyant quality"
which would "limit my options."

1:01:33.427 --> 1:01:35.229
And then for grad school,
I went to

1:01:35.262 --> 1:01:37.298
one of the best journalism
schools in the country,

1:01:37.331 --> 1:01:38.933
and my teacher there,

1:01:38.966 --> 1:01:41.368
this old, closeted queen
who was married to a woman,

1:01:41.402 --> 1:01:45.105
pulled me aside and thought
he was doing me a favor

1:01:45.139 --> 1:01:47.107
when he told me that
I should stick to writing

1:01:47.141 --> 1:01:50.211
because my voice sounded
too gay to do the news on TV.

1:01:50.244 --> 1:01:52.179
True story.

1:01:52.213 --> 1:01:55.482
And then I did stick to writing
and my gay history books.

1:01:55.517 --> 1:01:58.819
Every single publisher,
every single one,

1:01:58.852 --> 1:02:01.956
told me there wasn't enough
of an audience for it.

1:02:01.989 --> 1:02:04.491
I was always too gay,
or I was too niche,

1:02:04.526 --> 1:02:07.361
or, you know,
I made people uncomfortable.

1:02:07.394 --> 1:02:11.498
Even my dad, who was
so wonderful and supportive--

1:02:11.533 --> 1:02:14.835
I remember him saying,
"You know, not everyone

1:02:14.868 --> 1:02:18.072
wants to hear this gay stuff
all the time."

1:02:19.907 --> 1:02:21.375
But what was I supposed to do?

1:02:21.408 --> 1:02:23.978
I mean...
I'm a writer.

1:02:24.011 --> 1:02:29.216
I wanted to write about
my life, my friends, my world.

1:02:30.884 --> 1:02:32.152
And I'm telling you,

1:02:32.186 --> 1:02:34.021
enough people
tell you things like that,

1:02:34.054 --> 1:02:36.857
no matter how confident you are,

1:02:36.890 --> 1:02:38.859
when you're alone at night,

1:02:38.892 --> 1:02:41.895
you start to think
that maybe they're right.

1:02:45.432 --> 1:02:48.570
So... I just...

1:02:48.603 --> 1:02:51.071
I put my head down,

1:02:51.105 --> 1:02:53.841
and I just worked really hard,

1:02:53.874 --> 1:02:57.177
and I just hoped that somehow

1:02:57.211 --> 1:03:01.248
all these other people
were wrong.

1:03:10.324 --> 1:03:12.226
And they were.

1:03:16.598 --> 1:03:18.999
And they were.

1:03:23.070 --> 1:03:25.306
I mean, I spent years

1:03:25.339 --> 1:03:29.910
watching a wave of mediocre
straight men passing me by.

1:03:29.943 --> 1:03:33.213
Men with half the talent,
who worked half as hard,

1:03:33.247 --> 1:03:34.882
who didn't care
as much as I did,

1:03:34.915 --> 1:03:36.984
and they got twice as far,
always.

1:03:37.017 --> 1:03:38.919
I mean,
that's an old story, but...

1:03:38.952 --> 1:03:42.256
And, you know,
the world caught up with us.

1:03:43.090 --> 1:03:45.292
Didn't catch up fast enough.

1:03:47.094 --> 1:03:49.463
Didn't catch up fast enough
for my parents to see

1:03:49.496 --> 1:03:52.466
all these great things
happen for me.

1:03:52.499 --> 1:03:54.101
Right?

1:03:55.269 --> 1:03:57.871
Didn't catch up fast enough
for a lot of people.

1:03:57.905 --> 1:03:59.406
That's the truth.

1:04:01.175 --> 1:04:04.612
Let me tell you,
confidence is just knowing

1:04:04.646 --> 1:04:06.947
you're the only person left
you can count on.

1:04:06.980 --> 1:04:08.916
That's all that is.

1:04:09.684 --> 1:04:11.418
That's all.

1:04:15.255 --> 1:04:16.924
Want another beer?

1:04:19.193 --> 1:04:21.161
Sure.

1:04:29.036 --> 1:04:31.573
Sorry. That was a lot.

1:04:31.606 --> 1:04:33.173

What's up? Aaron!

1:07:07.795 --> 1:07:09.531
- Wh...
- What's up, man?

1:07:09.564 --> 1:07:11.666
-Whoa. -I was wondering
when I was gonna run into you.

1:07:11.699 --> 1:07:13.668
It's like seven of us.

1:07:13.701 --> 1:07:15.803
Hey, congratulations
on everything.

1:07:15.837 --> 1:07:17.572
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, it's been crazy, man.

1:07:17.605 --> 1:07:20.274
Cool. So, um, yeah,
what have you been doing?

1:07:20.307 --> 1:07:22.544
Louis was like,
"No, I need to see options."

1:07:22.577 --> 1:07:24.679
And then he started sending me
Airbnb options.

1:07:24.712 --> 1:07:26.113
-Am I boring you?
-No, no, no.

1:07:26.146 --> 1:07:27.615
And I'm like,
"No, we deserve this..."

1:07:33.588 --> 1:07:35.255
Bobby.

1:07:35.289 --> 1:07:37.859
-What do you want?
-I want you.

1:07:39.661 --> 1:07:41.328
What's up?

1:07:42.329 --> 1:07:44.866
Um, where do we stand on this?

1:07:44.899 --> 1:07:46.601
Where do we stand on what?

1:07:46.634 --> 1:07:48.803
- "Momogany."
- Oh.

1:07:48.836 --> 1:07:50.505
On "momogany"?

1:07:50.538 --> 1:07:52.472
Are we open? What are we into?
What are we doing? Like...

1:07:52.507 --> 1:07:54.809
Oh, this is just like
<i>When Harry Met Sally.</i>

1:07:54.842 --> 1:07:56.310
What do you mean?

1:07:56.343 --> 1:07:58.245
It's that classic scene
where Billy Crystal

1:07:58.278 --> 1:07:59.847
runs to Meg Ryan
on New Year's Eve and asks her

1:07:59.881 --> 1:08:01.516
if she wants to have
an open relationship.

1:08:03.551 --> 1:08:05.319
-Well, but...
-I mean,

1:08:05.352 --> 1:08:08.155
I'm not, like,
into monogamy, you know.

1:08:08.188 --> 1:08:09.724
But I don't think
we should be, like,

1:08:09.757 --> 1:08:11.325
constantly fucking other people.

1:08:11.358 --> 1:08:12.459
No.

1:08:12.492 --> 1:08:14.127
Why do you ask?

1:08:16.496 --> 1:08:20.233
Oh, you want to fuck
your little hockey friend.

1:08:20.267 --> 1:08:21.603
No, I want to fuck you.

1:08:21.636 --> 1:08:24.438
-Oh, that's nice.
-But maybe he's there, too.

1:08:33.548 --> 1:08:34.716
He's very hot.

1:08:36.718 --> 1:08:39.419
-Hi, Joshua.
-Hey. -Hey.

1:08:41.321 --> 1:08:42.557
Hi.

1:08:43.925 --> 1:08:45.258

Mm.

1:10:11.344 --> 1:10:13.614
Thank you.

1:10:23.323 --> 1:10:25.292
So, I may have been wrong about

1:10:25.325 --> 1:10:28.863
the whole hooking up
with other people thing.

1:10:28.896 --> 1:10:29.864
Okay.

1:10:29.897 --> 1:10:32.033
I don't know. I just...

1:10:32.066 --> 1:10:35.368
I want to be cool
and free, and, you know,

1:10:35.402 --> 1:10:39.841
I don't want to be lame,
but actually seeing you--

1:10:39.874 --> 1:10:42.309
I don't know. It just...

1:10:42.342 --> 1:10:44.679
It wasn't working for me.

1:10:46.313 --> 1:10:48.716
Yeah, no, totally. I-I get it.

1:10:49.717 --> 1:10:50.885
You sure?

1:10:50.918 --> 1:10:52.854
Yeah.

1:10:52.887 --> 1:10:55.288
Okay.

1:10:55.923 --> 1:10:57.525
Thank you.

1:11:01.629 --> 1:11:05.298
Oh. Sorry, my mom
will not stop texting me.

1:11:05.332 --> 1:11:06.934
When do your folks
get here again?

1:11:06.968 --> 1:11:08.035
The 21st.

1:11:08.069 --> 1:11:09.504
She wants to do the whole

1:11:09.537 --> 1:11:11.038
"magical Christmas
in New York" thing.

1:11:11.072 --> 1:11:12.540
They love sightseeing.

1:11:12.573 --> 1:11:14.075
I have no idea
what to do with them.

1:11:14.108 --> 1:11:16.077
Well, if you need me,
I'll be home

1:11:16.110 --> 1:11:17.812
hate-watching
Hallheart Christmas movies.

1:11:22.550 --> 1:11:24.519
Hey.

1:11:24.552 --> 1:11:28.623
Do you maybe want to spend
Christmas with me and my folks?

1:11:28.656 --> 1:11:30.792
Really?

1:11:30.825 --> 1:11:32.927
Because, honestly,
I am totally fine alone.

1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:34.494
That is very sweet
of you, though.

1:11:34.529 --> 1:11:36.564
No, you shouldn't be alone.
That's crazy.

1:11:37.832 --> 1:11:38.933
Okay.

1:11:38.966 --> 1:11:40.668
Yeah, that'll be fun.

1:11:40.701 --> 1:11:43.671
And, honestly, no one knows
New York City better than me.

1:11:43.704 --> 1:11:45.940
I will plan the ultimate
New York City Christmas,

1:11:45.973 --> 1:11:47.942
as only
a New York City Jew could.

1:11:47.975 --> 1:11:49.342
Amazing.

1:11:49.376 --> 1:11:50.678
But just keep in mind, you know,

1:11:50.711 --> 1:11:52.345
they're, like, quiet folks
from a small town.

1:11:52.379 --> 1:11:54.015
Aaron, I understand.

1:11:54.048 --> 1:11:55.683
You and I come from
different worlds.

1:11:55.716 --> 1:11:59.020
I'm from New York City.
You're from Upstate New York.

1:11:59.053 --> 1:12:01.589
I mean,
they're sweet, but just...

1:12:03.456 --> 1:12:06.527
If you could just
be, like, chill.

1:12:06.561 --> 1:12:08.963
I promise I won't embarrass you.

1:12:08.996 --> 1:12:11.132
And, Mrs. Shepard, these are
the first holiday windows

1:12:11.165 --> 1:12:13.501
to ever feature
a sex-positive Tiny Tim.

1:12:13.534 --> 1:12:14.569
And it's so important.

1:12:14.602 --> 1:12:15.970
We don't get queer characters

1:12:16.003 --> 1:12:17.038
in the stories
that we read as kids.

1:12:17.071 --> 1:12:18.039
There's no gay Cinderella.

1:12:18.072 --> 1:12:20.407
There's no lesbian Rapunzel.

1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:21.976
There's no nonbinary
Ebenezer Scrooge.

1:12:22.009 --> 1:12:24.078
Uh, Bobby, I think they get it.

1:12:24.111 --> 1:12:26.379
Guys, we've got to go.

1:12:26.413 --> 1:12:27.815
I told Josh Evans
we would meet him

1:12:27.849 --> 1:12:30.585
at the Hallheart Christmas
movie pop-up village.

1:12:30.618 --> 1:12:32.119
We're seeing Josh Evans?

1:12:32.153 --> 1:12:34.454
I didn't know.

1:12:34.487 --> 1:12:35.422
Let's do it.

1:12:35.455 --> 1:12:37.124
Are you a Hallheart fan?

1:12:37.158 --> 1:12:38.860
I dabble.

1:12:41.529 --> 1:12:44.131
This is so beautiful.

1:12:44.165 --> 1:12:45.666
I know. I love it.

1:12:45.700 --> 1:12:46.701
There's Josh.

1:12:46.734 --> 1:12:49.003
Wearing shorts in winter,
like a total psychopath.

1:12:49.036 --> 1:12:50.403
Oh, my goodness.

1:12:50.437 --> 1:12:55.009
They have
Rachael Ray edible tinsel!

1:12:55.042 --> 1:12:57.578
- Josh! Evans!
- Hey, fellas.

1:12:57.612 --> 1:12:59.714
-How's Hallheart Village
treating ya? -Hey.

1:12:59.747 --> 1:13:01.481
Did you see the gay movie
that they did?

1:13:01.515 --> 1:13:02.884
It was kind of dope.

1:13:02.917 --> 1:13:04.752
Yeah, for years they ignored us,

1:13:04.785 --> 1:13:06.486
then their audience got
10% less homophobic,

1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:07.889
so they decided
we're a new demographic

1:13:07.922 --> 1:13:10.024
they can sell shit to.
I mean, look at these movies.

1:13:10.057 --> 1:13:12.727
<i>Have Yourself A Heteronormative</i>
<i>Little Christmas.</i>

1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:15.196
<i>Miracle on 34th Street</i>
<i>but with One Gay Guy.</i>

1:13:15.229 --> 1:13:17.632
<i>Home Alone</i>
<i>but with Sarah Paulson.</i>

1:13:17.665 --> 1:13:19.133
- I mean, it's absurd.
- Josh.

1:13:19.166 --> 1:13:21.769
-Hey.
-Merry Christmas.

1:13:21.802 --> 1:13:22.904
Come get skates.

1:13:22.937 --> 1:13:24.505
I want to see you and Aaron

1:13:24.538 --> 1:13:26.774
back out on the ice for
old times' sake.

1:13:26.807 --> 1:13:27.642
Yeah.

1:13:27.675 --> 1:13:29.510
Bobby, Josh and Aaron

1:13:29.543 --> 1:13:31.212
played hockey together
in high school.

1:13:31.245 --> 1:13:32.613
-Oh, I know.
-Yeah.

1:13:32.647 --> 1:13:34.782
-Come on.
-Hey, man, what's going on?

1:13:34.815 --> 1:13:37.518
-Dude, what is your problem?
-What?

1:13:37.551 --> 1:13:39.654
Could you just, like,
maybe tone it down a notch?

1:13:39.687 --> 1:13:41.488
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1:13:41.522 --> 1:13:43.124
We've been with my parents
for two hours,

1:13:43.157 --> 1:13:45.059
and you've already talked
about transgender mannequins,

1:13:45.092 --> 1:13:46.727
HIV prevention,

1:13:46.761 --> 1:13:48.930
and you pointed out the route
to the 1976 Dyke March.

1:13:48.963 --> 1:13:51.464
They're having fun.
They're totally fine.

1:13:51.498 --> 1:13:52.800
What is your problem?

1:13:52.833 --> 1:13:53.935
I'm nervous, okay?

1:13:53.968 --> 1:13:55.569
I've never
introduced them to anybody.

1:13:55.603 --> 1:13:57.004
I just don't want them
to get weirded out.

1:13:57.038 --> 1:14:00.174
I want them to have, like,
a chill, normal time.

1:14:00.207 --> 1:14:01.943
So now I'm not normal?

1:14:01.976 --> 1:14:03.476
Bobby, you know what I mean.

1:14:03.511 --> 1:14:05.713
I'm just being myself.

1:14:05.746 --> 1:14:07.715
Okay, but maybe
you could just be, like,

1:14:07.748 --> 1:14:10.952
a little less yourself
for like three hours.

1:14:10.985 --> 1:14:12.787
I want them to like you.

1:14:14.722 --> 1:14:16.524
Oh. Yeah.

1:14:16.557 --> 1:14:18.125
No, sure. Of course.

1:14:18.159 --> 1:14:19.560
Yeah, I'll just...

1:14:19.593 --> 1:14:21.629
I'll just be quiet.

1:14:21.662 --> 1:14:23.764
Okay, thank you.

1:14:23.798 --> 1:14:25.700
Bobby! Oh, my God!

1:14:25.733 --> 1:14:27.001
Hi!

1:14:27.034 --> 1:14:28.769
-Hi!
-Jesus Christ.

1:14:28.803 --> 1:14:30.705
We have to go anyway.
We have a dinner reservation.

1:14:30.738 --> 1:14:32.273
Where's dinner again?

Hey, Dad,
how are the Polar Bears doing?

1:14:51.292 --> 1:14:52.994
That's the team
Josh and I used to play on.

1:14:53.027 --> 1:14:54.829
They haven't won all year.

1:14:54.862 --> 1:14:56.864
I told Josh they need you boys
to come back.

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:02.603
Bobby, you seem quiet tonight.

1:15:02.636 --> 1:15:03.871
Is everything all right?

1:15:03.904 --> 1:15:06.640
Oh, yeah, I'm totally fine.
Yeah.

1:15:06.674 --> 1:15:08.075
I'm actually--
You know, I'm sorry

1:15:08.109 --> 1:15:09.643
if I spoke too much today.

1:15:09.677 --> 1:15:11.278
I just-- I think I got nervous.

1:15:11.312 --> 1:15:13.280
This is actually more like
how I usually am.

1:15:13.314 --> 1:15:14.815
I'm very quiet.

1:15:14.849 --> 1:15:17.651
Very quiet and just,
like, weirdly normal.

1:15:17.685 --> 1:15:19.720
Well, thanks again

1:15:19.754 --> 1:15:21.756
for planning such a lovely day.

1:15:21.789 --> 1:15:23.691
Oh, you're so welcome,
Mrs. Shepard.

1:15:23.724 --> 1:15:25.559
Oh, you sound like
one of my students.

1:15:25.593 --> 1:15:27.194
Call me Anne.

1:15:27.228 --> 1:15:28.629
Okay, I will.

1:15:28.662 --> 1:15:30.331
Uh, Mom's been
a second grade teacher

1:15:30.364 --> 1:15:31.766
for almost 40 years now.

1:15:31.799 --> 1:15:33.667
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

1:15:33.701 --> 1:15:35.569
We need good teachers,
now more than ever.

1:15:35.603 --> 1:15:38.305
Thank you. I agree.

1:15:38.339 --> 1:15:43.077
And Aaron says you're working
at an American history museum.

1:15:44.245 --> 1:15:46.781
Yes. Yes, it is.

1:15:46.814 --> 1:15:48.716
It's an American history museum.

1:15:48.749 --> 1:15:49.950
Hmm.

1:15:49.984 --> 1:15:51.786
Mm-hmm.

1:15:51.819 --> 1:15:54.221
Well, it's actually
an LGBTQ history museum.

1:15:54.255 --> 1:15:56.924
It's the first major queer
history museum in America.

1:15:56.957 --> 1:15:58.692
Do you teach your students
any gay history?

1:15:58.726 --> 1:16:00.127
'Cause I know in a few states

1:16:00.161 --> 1:16:01.829
they're finally starting
to do it.

1:16:02.696 --> 1:16:06.801
Well, I teach
second grade, so no.

1:16:06.834 --> 1:16:08.069
Oh, right.

1:16:08.102 --> 1:16:10.137
No, I understand. Yeah.

1:16:14.275 --> 1:16:16.110
Out of curiosity, why not?

1:16:16.143 --> 1:16:18.212
Well, I just think

1:16:18.245 --> 1:16:20.281
they're a little young for that.

1:16:20.314 --> 1:16:22.183
Oh, of course. Yeah.

1:16:22.216 --> 1:16:24.585
No, I understand that.

1:16:26.987 --> 1:16:28.823
I don't think so, though.

1:16:28.856 --> 1:16:30.791
-Ah, Bobby.
-No, no, no, I'm just saying.

1:16:30.825 --> 1:16:33.094
If I may disagree respectfully.

1:16:33.127 --> 1:16:34.328
That's actually the best time

1:16:34.361 --> 1:16:35.896
to teach them,
when they're young.

1:16:35.930 --> 1:16:37.832
You know, that way
they develop an appreciation

1:16:37.865 --> 1:16:39.400
for queer people before they
all start bullying each other

1:16:39.433 --> 1:16:41.302
or hating themselves
if they're gay.

1:16:41.335 --> 1:16:43.104
Maybe you're right.

1:16:43.137 --> 1:16:45.005
Oh.

1:16:46.774 --> 1:16:49.076
Feels a little young, though.

1:16:49.110 --> 1:16:50.978
Hmm. Right.

1:16:51.011 --> 1:16:52.780
Totally. I get it.

1:16:52.813 --> 1:16:55.249
- I will drop it.
--Yeah.

1:16:55.282 --> 1:16:56.317
-Agree to disagree.
-Yeah.

1:16:56.350 --> 1:16:58.018
-Cheers to that.
-Yes.

1:16:58.052 --> 1:17:00.688
Hey, so, uh, when are
you guys heading home...

1:17:00.721 --> 1:17:02.123
It's not really
that young, though.

1:17:02.156 --> 1:17:03.657
It's not that young.

1:17:03.691 --> 1:17:05.126
Bobby, can you please drop it?

1:17:05.159 --> 1:17:07.428
No, I can't, because we're
talking about gay kids here,

1:17:07.461 --> 1:17:08.863
and it's important.

1:17:08.896 --> 1:17:10.264
One of the things
that saved me is that

1:17:10.297 --> 1:17:12.900
my parents exposed me to
gay stories when I was a kid.

1:17:12.933 --> 1:17:15.069
When I was 12 years old--
this is true--

1:17:15.102 --> 1:17:17.138
my parents took me
to see a Broadway play

1:17:17.171 --> 1:17:18.672
called <i>Love and Compassion.</i>

1:17:18.706 --> 1:17:20.007
It was about a group of gay men

1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:22.009
spending the summer together
in Provincetown.

1:17:22.042 --> 1:17:24.011
And all of a sudden,
the curtain goes up,

1:17:24.044 --> 1:17:27.748
and there are seven completely
naked gay men onstage.

1:17:27.781 --> 1:17:30.885
And there I am,
sitting between my mom and dad

1:17:30.918 --> 1:17:34.722
at age 12,
looking at seven soft penises.

1:17:34.755 --> 1:17:36.891
- Shit.
- And all of a sudden,

1:17:36.924 --> 1:17:38.425
two of the guys
start making out,

1:17:38.459 --> 1:17:40.294
and then one of them starts,
like, talking dirty, you know?

1:17:40.327 --> 1:17:42.062
And I remember this so vividly.

1:17:42.096 --> 1:17:44.031
There was a sex scene,
and one of the guys is like,

1:17:44.064 --> 1:17:46.934
"Pound my prostate.
Pound my prostate."

1:17:46.967 --> 1:17:48.435
You know, "Milk me. Milk me."

1:17:48.469 --> 1:17:50.171
And I didn't even know
what that was.

1:17:50.204 --> 1:17:51.906
I mean, now I do.

1:17:51.939 --> 1:17:53.440
But, you know,
it was incredible.

1:17:53.474 --> 1:17:55.309
You know, to know
that I could sit there,

1:17:55.342 --> 1:17:58.812
between my mom and dad,
looking at seven penises.

1:17:58.846 --> 1:18:00.314
Seven penises, Anne.

1:18:00.347 --> 1:18:01.982
I was 12.

1:18:02.016 --> 1:18:04.351
And to know that they were
okay with that, I mean,

1:18:04.385 --> 1:18:05.920
that had a profound effect
on me.

1:18:05.953 --> 1:18:07.855
All I'm saying is,
we need to remove the stigma

1:18:07.888 --> 1:18:09.356
from that type of thing
so that gay kids

1:18:09.390 --> 1:18:11.325
can feel good about themselves.
That's all I'm saying.

1:18:11.358 --> 1:18:13.460
I mean, look at Aaron
and how much he hates his life.

1:18:13.494 --> 1:18:15.496
-Bobby.
-No, all I'm saying is there's

1:18:15.530 --> 1:18:17.064
a direct correlation between
how unhappy you are

1:18:17.097 --> 1:18:18.732
with your life
and what you weren't taught

1:18:18.766 --> 1:18:19.800
about your potential as a child.

1:18:19.833 --> 1:18:20.935
Bobby, stop talking.

1:18:20.968 --> 1:18:22.303
-Wh...
-Seriously, enough.

1:18:22.336 --> 1:18:23.804
I will kill you.

1:18:23.837 --> 1:18:26.340
Aaron, you hate your life?

Hey, are you mad?

1:18:53.568 --> 1:18:54.835
Me? No, I'm great.

1:18:54.868 --> 1:18:55.970
Josh just texted me.

1:18:56.003 --> 1:18:57.271
I'm gonna meet him at that bar.

1:18:57.304 --> 1:18:58.872
I think we should go home
and talk about this.

1:18:58.906 --> 1:19:00.841
Oh, really?
You want to talk more?

1:19:00.874 --> 1:19:02.343
Well, I think it's better than
going to party with Josh,

1:19:02.376 --> 1:19:04.011
the self-loathing meathead
who took 40 years to come out.

1:19:04.044 --> 1:19:05.346
Yeah, well,
not everybody's you, Bobby.

1:19:05.379 --> 1:19:06.947
Okay, but 40 years?

1:19:06.981 --> 1:19:08.249
J.R.R. Tolkien took less time
with his journey.

1:19:08.282 --> 1:19:11.185
God, you are fucking relentless.

1:19:11.218 --> 1:19:13.020
"Aaron hates his life"?

1:19:13.053 --> 1:19:14.989
God.

1:19:16.290 --> 1:19:17.291
Hey.

1:19:18.292 --> 1:19:19.860
Hey!

1:19:21.128 --> 1:19:22.830
Fuck!

1:19:40.047 --> 1:19:42.116
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1:19:42.149 --> 1:19:43.384
Good man.

1:19:48.590 --> 1:19:50.157
Ah, dude. No.

1:19:50.190 --> 1:19:51.892
Hey, just kiss me.

1:19:58.265 --> 1:19:59.366
Aaron.

1:20:00.502 --> 1:20:01.969
Oh, hey, Bob.

1:20:02.002 --> 1:20:03.304
Uh, shit, Bobby,
we were just playing around.

1:20:03.337 --> 1:20:05.439
-It's-it's...
-You were just playing around?

1:20:05.472 --> 1:20:06.907
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1:20:06.940 --> 1:20:09.243
-Bobby, Bobby.
-Josh, leave. -I'm sorry.

1:20:09.276 --> 1:20:10.944
Get the fuck out of here!

1:20:10.978 --> 1:20:12.980
-Bobby, calm down.
-Oh, my God, I knew it.

1:20:13.013 --> 1:20:14.616
I fucking knew it.

1:20:14.649 --> 1:20:15.983
Just say it.

1:20:16.016 --> 1:20:17.451
Can you please just say it?

1:20:17.484 --> 1:20:20.888
Finally, just fucking say it,
because I already know.

1:20:21.589 --> 1:20:23.457
-You're not attracted to me.
-What?

1:20:23.490 --> 1:20:26.594
I see the guys you look at,
at the gym and the club.

1:20:26.628 --> 1:20:28.530
Everywhere! Everywhere we go!

1:20:28.563 --> 1:20:30.197
-Okay, Bobby...
-Go be with him

1:20:30.230 --> 1:20:32.032
if that's what you want,
but I will not let you

1:20:32.066 --> 1:20:33.334
- drag me into this any further.
- It's not...

1:20:33.367 --> 1:20:34.602
And I will not let you
break my heart.

1:20:34.636 --> 1:20:36.103
I am too smart for that!

1:20:36.136 --> 1:20:37.539
Bobby, why did you say
that shit about me

1:20:37.572 --> 1:20:38.972
in front of my parents?

1:20:39.006 --> 1:20:40.474
I begged you
not to embarrass me,

1:20:40.508 --> 1:20:42.876
but you couldn't help yourself.

1:20:43.977 --> 1:20:45.946
What is wrong with you?

1:20:46.581 --> 1:20:49.917
What is wrong with me?

1:20:49.950 --> 1:20:51.653
"Tone it down, Bobby."

1:20:51.686 --> 1:20:53.320
"Be quiet, Bobby."

1:20:53.354 --> 1:20:55.989
"Can't you be
a little bit less of yourself,

1:20:56.023 --> 1:20:57.257
just for a few hours?"

1:20:58.258 --> 1:21:01.228
You don't think
I know what that means?

1:21:01.261 --> 1:21:03.297
You don't think I know
what that's code for?

1:21:03.330 --> 1:21:05.032
You don't think
I've been hearing that

1:21:05.065 --> 1:21:07.267
my whole fucking life?

1:21:08.670 --> 1:21:10.971
That's what you think about me?

1:21:13.173 --> 1:21:16.310
I'm not apologizing for myself.
I will leave that to you.

1:21:37.297 --> 1:21:39.066
Hey, question for you
because you know everyone.

1:21:39.099 --> 1:21:40.267
I need a makeover.

1:21:40.300 --> 1:21:42.537
Ooh, yeah.
Let's go to a spa weekend.

1:21:42.570 --> 1:21:44.004
No, I want steroids or, like,

1:21:44.037 --> 1:21:45.339
testosterone or HGH
or something.

1:21:45.372 --> 1:21:47.141
I keep working out,
but I don't get bigger.

1:21:47.174 --> 1:21:48.710
I want to look like
a fucking action star.

1:21:48.743 --> 1:21:50.277
Forget Provincetown.
I want people to think

1:21:50.310 --> 1:21:52.112
I have a summer share
on <i>Jumanji.</i>

1:21:52.146 --> 1:21:54.114
I'm sick of being niche.
I want to be Thor.

1:21:54.148 --> 1:21:56.116
Bobby, you know that steroids

1:21:56.150 --> 1:21:57.184
don't make you big
on their own, right?

1:21:57.217 --> 1:21:58.586
Like, you still have to work out

1:21:58.620 --> 1:22:00.087
-and you can't miss the window.
-I know!

1:22:04.458 --> 1:22:07.428
Let's fucking go.

1:22:07.461 --> 1:22:08.596
Ow.

1:22:11.432 --> 1:22:12.433
No.

1:22:12.466 --> 1:22:13.735
Fuck!

1:22:17.104 --> 1:22:18.272
No! What are you doing?!

1:22:18.305 --> 1:22:20.040
- Stop that!
- Bobby! Bobby!

1:22:20.073 --> 1:22:21.576
-The Lincoln exhibit
is canceled. -Why?

1:22:21.609 --> 1:22:23.110
People are threatening
a boycott.

1:22:23.143 --> 1:22:24.445
They're pulling their donations.

1:22:24.478 --> 1:22:25.446
There's just not enough proof.

1:22:25.479 --> 1:22:27.047
Okay.

1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:29.016
You want to put Lincoln
back in the closet? Fine!

1:22:29.049 --> 1:22:30.484
-I'll put him back
in the closet! -Bobby.

1:22:30.518 --> 1:22:32.720
-I'll put him back in
the fucking closet! -Bobby.

1:22:32.754 --> 1:22:33.688
Here!

1:22:33.721 --> 1:22:35.456
There you go!

1:22:35.489 --> 1:22:38.358
Lincoln is back in the closet
where you all need him to be!

1:22:38.392 --> 1:22:39.661
I'm on steroids!

1:22:39.694 --> 1:22:40.695
Okay, Bobby, just calm down.

1:22:40.728 --> 1:22:42.730
So, Angela and I have proposed

1:22:42.764 --> 1:22:45.299
that the final exhibit
be called "Post-Gay."

1:22:45.332 --> 1:22:46.233
Post-Gay?

1:22:46.266 --> 1:22:49.369
Yes, because
just being gay is old news.

1:22:49.403 --> 1:22:51.539
Okay, so,
now I'm too gay for Aaron,

1:22:51.573 --> 1:22:53.006
but I'm too straight for you?

1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:55.242
Will somebody please tell me

1:22:55.275 --> 1:22:57.779
exactly how gay
I'm supposed to be?!

1:22:57.812 --> 1:23:00.214
Poor Abraham Lincoln
can't even be gay now?!

1:23:00.247 --> 1:23:01.783
Because he wasn't gay, Bobby.

1:23:01.816 --> 1:23:04.284
- He was bi, and I have...
- Okay, enough!

1:23:04.318 --> 1:23:06.386
You want to get rid
of our stories? Fine!

1:23:06.420 --> 1:23:08.455
Let's get rid of them!

1:23:08.489 --> 1:23:10.057
I have roid rage!

1:23:10.090 --> 1:23:12.292
Are you insane?

1:23:12.326 --> 1:23:15.395
-Bobby...
-Yeah, bye-bye, Buttigieg!

1:23:16.430 --> 1:23:17.532
-Stop it, Bobby.
-No!

1:23:17.565 --> 1:23:19.567
-Bobby!
-Give-- No!

1:23:19.601 --> 1:23:21.068
Give it to me!

1:23:21.101 --> 1:23:23.103
-Put the flag down!
-No! Give it to me!

1:23:23.136 --> 1:23:25.439
Give it to...

1:23:25.472 --> 1:23:27.775
Angela and the lesbians,
hold him down.

1:23:27.809 --> 1:23:30.377
No!

1:23:30.410 --> 1:23:33.180
-You're on steroids?
-You can't tell.

1:23:33.213 --> 1:23:35.449
You know what?
I don't need this shit.

1:23:35.482 --> 1:23:36.518
Me neither.

1:23:36.551 --> 1:23:38.252
Lesbians, disperse!

1:23:38.987 --> 1:23:40.555
I hate the museum,

1:23:40.588 --> 1:23:44.424
but most of all, I really
fucking hate storytelling.

1:23:46.426 --> 1:23:47.829
She doesn't like
telling stories.

1:23:47.862 --> 1:23:49.229
Maybe the final wing should be

1:23:49.263 --> 1:23:51.465
a big empty room
where people can go

1:23:51.498 --> 1:23:53.300
to just shut the fuck up!

1:23:53.333 --> 1:23:54.636
Okay. Yeah.

1:23:54.669 --> 1:23:56.738
Leave! All of you!

1:23:56.771 --> 1:23:58.438
Oh, shit, my window.

1:23:58.472 --> 1:24:00.374
My workout window!

1:24:21.161 --> 1:24:22.697
♪ Drop the bass. ♪

1:24:31.204 --> 1:24:32.507
Hey, bro.

1:24:32.540 --> 1:24:34.842
-Hey, bro. What's up?
-What's up?

1:24:34.876 --> 1:24:36.343
I'm Joel.

1:24:36.376 --> 1:24:39.246
I'm... Rob.

1:24:39.279 --> 1:24:40.715
Hey, can you help me
with this set, bro?

1:24:40.748 --> 1:24:43.317
Yeah, sure, bro. Yeah.

1:24:43.350 --> 1:24:45.085
Nice.

1:24:45.887 --> 1:24:47.889
-You doing chest?
-Yep.

1:24:47.922 --> 1:24:50.257
-Leg day for me, bro.
-Oh, nice.

1:24:50.290 --> 1:24:51.759
Got to work on those hammies.

1:24:51.793 --> 1:24:52.827
Yeah.

1:24:52.860 --> 1:24:54.194
Go put them all on.

1:24:54.227 --> 1:24:55.630
Doing a superset today.

1:24:55.663 --> 1:24:56.764
-Oh, superset?
-Yeah.

1:24:56.798 --> 1:24:58.398
Yeah, superset.

1:24:58.432 --> 1:24:59.266
Pack it up, bro.

1:24:59.299 --> 1:25:00.735
-Lots of plates.
-Yeah.

1:25:00.768 --> 1:25:02.402
I haven't seen this many plates

1:25:02.436 --> 1:25:04.806
since, uh,
the Jewish holidays, bro.

1:25:04.839 --> 1:25:06.507
-Nice, nice.
-Yeah.

1:25:08.308 --> 1:25:10.645
We should hang out
again sometime.

1:25:10.678 --> 1:25:11.879
Maybe watch a game?

1:25:11.913 --> 1:25:13.146
Yeah, I'd love that.

1:25:13.180 --> 1:25:14.481
I'll give you my number.

1:25:14.515 --> 1:25:16.651
Holy shit, dude.
What happened to your voice?

1:25:16.684 --> 1:25:17.752
Oh, fuck.

1:25:17.785 --> 1:25:20.454
Um, okay, I'm really sorry.

1:25:20.487 --> 1:25:23.423
But, um--
I know this is very strange,

1:25:23.457 --> 1:25:26.159
but when I-I, when I walked
up to you in the gym,

1:25:26.193 --> 1:25:28.362
I-I just did this voice,
you know?

1:25:28.395 --> 1:25:29.564
Like, you know, like,

1:25:29.597 --> 1:25:30.898
"Hey, bro. What's up?"

1:25:30.932 --> 1:25:31.899
I-I don't know.

1:25:31.933 --> 1:25:33.266
I just was trying it.

1:25:33.300 --> 1:25:34.636
Holy shit,
are you a serial killer?

1:25:34.669 --> 1:25:36.504
Are you gonna fucking
kill a bro right now?

1:25:36.537 --> 1:25:38.472
No, no, no. I'm not killing
a bro. I'm so sorry.

1:25:38.506 --> 1:25:40.307
No, this is weird.
I'm sorry. I'll go.

1:25:40.340 --> 1:25:42.175
Yeah, you need to leave
right now.

1:25:42.209 --> 1:25:43.377
But it kind of worked, right?

1:25:43.410 --> 1:25:44.512
Like, that's what's weird
about it...

1:25:44.545 --> 1:25:45.412
Dude, hurry up, man.

1:25:45.445 --> 1:25:46.914
I know, but just the fact
that I was like,

1:25:46.948 --> 1:25:48.348
"Hey, bro. What's up?"

1:25:48.382 --> 1:25:49.182
Okay, I'm leaving.

1:25:49.216 --> 1:25:50.518
I'm so sorry.

1:25:50.551 --> 1:25:52.252
I'm going through
a very hard time right now.

1:25:52.285 --> 1:25:53.788
-I ain't ask for all that.
-Okay.

1:25:53.821 --> 1:25:55.823
I'm sorry. I'm going. I'm going.

1:25:55.857 --> 1:25:57.592
Can I just ask you
one thing, though?

1:25:57.625 --> 1:26:00.962
If I had come up to you
and used my real voice,

1:26:00.995 --> 1:26:02.764
would you have been
attracted to me?

1:26:02.797 --> 1:26:04.264
Wow.

1:26:04.297 --> 1:26:07.200
That is really sad, but...

1:26:07.234 --> 1:26:09.403
Yeah, I think so.

1:26:09.436 --> 1:26:10.738
Oh.

1:26:10.772 --> 1:26:12.406
But not now.

1:26:13.407 --> 1:26:14.909
Okay.

1:26:14.942 --> 1:26:16.443
I'm really sorry.

1:26:21.783 --> 1:26:23.551
-Streisand?
-Of course.

1:26:23.584 --> 1:26:24.451
I love her.

1:26:24.484 --> 1:26:26.988
-She's the best.
-Streisand fucking rules.

1:26:27.021 --> 1:26:29.624
This is actually kind of like
<i>Yentl,</i> if you think about it.

1:26:29.657 --> 1:26:32.325
-Dude, get the fuck out!
-I'm so sorry.

1:26:33.326 --> 1:26:35.228
Later.

1:26:35.262 --> 1:26:36.898
Sorry.

1:26:36.931 --> 1:26:39.266
And now,
Hallheart proudly presents

1:26:39.299 --> 1:26:41.903
our first polyamorous
holiday film,

1:26:41.936 --> 1:26:43.705
<i>A Holly, Poly Christmas.</i>

1:26:43.738 --> 1:26:46.007
Look, it's snowing.

1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:48.843
It's snowing on
all seven of us.

1:26:48.876 --> 1:26:50.712
Oh, man.

1:27:07.294 --> 1:27:09.229
Hey.

1:27:09.797 --> 1:27:11.231
Hey.

1:27:12.533 --> 1:27:13.768
Can we talk?

1:27:15.036 --> 1:27:16.771
Okay.

1:27:22.910 --> 1:27:24.679
So, what's up?

1:27:25.646 --> 1:27:28.883
Bobby, I am so sorry
I told you not to be yourself.

1:27:28.916 --> 1:27:31.886
I know I fucked up,
but this is new for me, too.

1:27:31.919 --> 1:27:35.556
And when you blew up in front
of my parents, honestly, it...

1:27:37.091 --> 1:27:39.594
...it felt like
you were doing it on purpose.

1:27:39.627 --> 1:27:41.829
I was.

1:27:41.863 --> 1:27:43.463
And I'm sorry.

1:27:43.497 --> 1:27:46.834
I shouldn't have handled it
like that. You're right.

1:27:46.868 --> 1:27:48.803
I'm sorry.

1:27:50.772 --> 1:27:53.007
But, Aaron,

1:27:53.040 --> 1:27:55.810
that doesn't
change the fact that

1:27:55.843 --> 1:27:57.912
you like a certain type of guy.

1:27:57.945 --> 1:28:01.281
And that isn't me,
and that's okay.

1:28:02.884 --> 1:28:05.052
You're right.

1:28:05.086 --> 1:28:07.989
I always pictured myself
with a guy...

1:28:08.022 --> 1:28:09.757
-Like Josh.
-Yeah, a guy like Josh.

1:28:09.791 --> 1:28:11.659
Yeah, he's hot.

1:28:11.692 --> 1:28:13.795
Yes, he's simple,
conventional, basic as hell

1:28:13.828 --> 1:28:16.429
and not somebody
that actually makes me happy.

1:28:18.099 --> 1:28:20.067
Bobby, you are
so different from me.

1:28:20.101 --> 1:28:22.937
You're not afraid
to take up space in the world.

1:28:22.970 --> 1:28:24.471
You challenge me.

1:28:24.505 --> 1:28:26.473
Which at first,
it freaked me out

1:28:26.507 --> 1:28:29.844
because who the fuck wants
to be challenged all the time?

1:28:29.877 --> 1:28:31.444
But...

1:28:34.015 --> 1:28:35.883
But I love it.

1:28:37.450 --> 1:28:38.920
You're what's been missing.

1:28:38.953 --> 1:28:42.455
I know I fucked up, but
please give me another chance.

1:28:42.489 --> 1:28:44.357
I miss you so much.

1:28:44.391 --> 1:28:46.594
I miss you, too.

1:28:48.563 --> 1:28:50.598
A lot.

1:28:51.866 --> 1:28:53.801
I didn't realize
until after we broke up

1:28:53.835 --> 1:28:57.470
there were actually a couple
of months there where I was...

1:28:57.505 --> 1:28:59.941
What do they call it?

1:28:59.974 --> 1:29:01.742
In a good mood.

1:29:17.191 --> 1:29:18.759
But I can't.

1:29:22.029 --> 1:29:25.800
My whole life, I have prided
myself on being self-aware

1:29:25.833 --> 1:29:28.870
and self-reliant
and self-possessed,

1:29:28.903 --> 1:29:31.471
and it didn't matter.

1:29:31.505 --> 1:29:33.541
It didn't matter because,
at the end of the day,

1:29:33.574 --> 1:29:35.442
I just ended up in the street

1:29:35.475 --> 1:29:37.745
looking at you
and looking at Josh

1:29:37.778 --> 1:29:40.882
and thinking,
"I'm not enough for him."

1:29:40.915 --> 1:29:42.583
I know, and I feel awful,

1:29:42.617 --> 1:29:44.886
but do not throw this away
because of one mistake!

1:29:44.919 --> 1:29:46.821
Wh-What do you want me to do?

1:29:46.854 --> 1:29:48.756
Say you'll give me
another chance.

1:29:48.789 --> 1:29:50.758
I can't do that.

1:29:50.791 --> 1:29:51.959
Why not?

1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:55.395
'Cause I don't trust you.

1:29:59.567 --> 1:30:01.202
I've been alone so long,
who knows?

1:30:01.235 --> 1:30:03.504
Maybe that's the only way
I know how to be.

1:30:03.537 --> 1:30:05.405
I don't know.

1:30:13.214 --> 1:30:15.516
I'm going.

1:30:22.223 --> 1:30:24.659
It's good.

1:30:24.692 --> 1:30:26.594
Hey!

1:30:29.096 --> 1:30:31.766
If you don't trust me,
that's fine.

1:30:32.633 --> 1:30:33.935
But if for some reason,

1:30:33.968 --> 1:30:35.770
underneath all that strength
and confidence,

1:30:35.803 --> 1:30:38.072
you still don't trust
that you are lovable enough,

1:30:38.105 --> 1:30:41.108
I'm living proof...

1:30:41.142 --> 1:30:42.877
that you're wrong.

1:31:06.901 --> 1:31:09.070
<i>First of all, thank you all</i>

1:31:09.103 --> 1:31:10.071
for letting me do this.

1:31:10.104 --> 1:31:11.706
I really appreciate it.

1:31:11.739 --> 1:31:13.240
Look, I know I've been

1:31:13.274 --> 1:31:17.511
a very angry,
judgmental person, obviously.

1:31:17.545 --> 1:31:18.746
And sometimes anger can be good.

1:31:18.779 --> 1:31:20.247
I know you all know that
because, for years,

1:31:20.281 --> 1:31:21.949
it was the fuel we all needed
to keep going.

1:31:21.983 --> 1:31:24.652
It wasn't that long ago
that the straight gatekeepers

1:31:24.685 --> 1:31:26.520
of the world
didn't allow for all of us

1:31:26.554 --> 1:31:28.055
to really succeed in a big way.

1:31:28.089 --> 1:31:30.758
Oh, my God. Do you guys
remember straight people?

1:31:30.791 --> 1:31:33.127
Yeah, they had a nice run.

1:31:33.160 --> 1:31:35.830
Look, Bobby, I'm a Black trans
woman, and I don't need you

1:31:35.863 --> 1:31:38.065
to come here
and lecture me about anger.

1:31:38.099 --> 1:31:40.668
But I get it.

1:31:40.701 --> 1:31:42.903
I am brimming

1:31:42.937 --> 1:31:44.672
with anger.

1:31:44.705 --> 1:31:47.041
And if I were to let
just an ounce of it out,

1:31:47.074 --> 1:31:50.578
I would probably explode
and kill every one of you.

1:31:50.611 --> 1:31:53.114
But, Bobby, I want you
to know something.

1:31:53.147 --> 1:31:55.082
I hear you.

1:31:55.116 --> 1:31:56.884
And I forgive you.

1:31:56.917 --> 1:31:58.219
You do?

1:31:58.252 --> 1:31:59.687
Yes.

1:31:59.720 --> 1:32:01.155
Look, this is the only community

1:32:01.188 --> 1:32:03.057
I've ever loved being a part of.

1:32:03.090 --> 1:32:07.094
And we fight like crazy,
and we always have, but...

1:32:08.596 --> 1:32:10.598
...you're my people.

1:32:11.732 --> 1:32:15.936
And I am so sorry that I was
so rude and spoke down to you.

1:32:15.970 --> 1:32:17.938
I should've shown you
much more respect.

1:32:17.972 --> 1:32:21.275
There is truly
no group of people on earth

1:32:21.308 --> 1:32:23.110
that I love and respect more.

1:32:23.144 --> 1:32:25.946
Well, I am not going to lie.
I am still angry.

1:32:25.980 --> 1:32:30.684
But I insist on progress,
not just for our LGBTQ heroes

1:32:30.718 --> 1:32:34.789
but for our LGBTQ assholes.

1:32:34.822 --> 1:32:35.589
Like you.

1:32:35.623 --> 1:32:37.758
Thank you, Robert.

No, you should
definitely post this.

1:32:48.169 --> 1:32:49.870

everything should be posted,

Hey. I've decided to quit.

1:33:21.669 --> 1:33:24.105
-I just quit, too.
-You did?

1:33:24.138 --> 1:33:26.273
I do this Kamala Harris
impression online,

1:33:26.307 --> 1:33:27.675
and it's really taken off.

1:33:27.708 --> 1:33:29.009
-Oh.
-Yeah, like--

1:33:29.043 --> 1:33:31.378
I'm Kamala Harris.

1:33:31.412 --> 1:33:32.680

1:33:35.182 --> 1:33:36.951
Good luck with that.

Yeah, good luck

1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:41.222
Thank you.

1:33:50.030 --> 1:33:53.734
Hey, Bobby, I wanted you to be
the first person to see this.

1:33:53.767 --> 1:33:55.703
This is Aaron Shepard's
Chocolate Factory.

1:33:55.736 --> 1:33:57.738
I made these little chocolates.

1:33:57.771 --> 1:33:59.807
I also made some special treats

1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:04.345
to celebrate the opening
of the LGBTQ+ Museum.

1:34:04.378 --> 1:34:06.280
These are Harvey Milk Duds.

1:34:06.313 --> 1:34:08.949
And instead of a heart-shaped
Valentine's Day box

1:34:08.983 --> 1:34:11.285
filled with chocolates,
we have a pink

1:34:11.318 --> 1:34:14.755
"silence equals death" triangle
filled with chocolates.

1:34:14.788 --> 1:34:17.691
And a tribute to my favorite
gay television character,

a Tirami-Susan from <i>Friends.</i>

1:34:21.929 --> 1:34:24.431
Of course Aaron likes <i>Friends.</i>

1:34:24.465 --> 1:34:26.901
Of course, all the profits
go to the museum.

1:34:26.934 --> 1:34:28.836
Okay.

1:34:28.869 --> 1:34:30.671

I know Mom pressured you
into inviting me, but...

1:34:54.128 --> 1:34:55.963
it's cool of you.

1:34:58.866 --> 1:35:01.335

-Yeah, I'm fine.

1:35:01.368 --> 1:35:03.871
I'm a very happy chocolatier.

1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:08.842

Whatever. I'm fine.

you're gonna say?

1:35:19.386 --> 1:35:21.088
"How do you decapitate?"

1:35:21.121 --> 1:35:22.756
What do you want me to say?
How do you remove their heads?

1:35:22.790 --> 1:35:23.958
What about,
"Hey, bro, how are you doing?

1:35:23.991 --> 1:35:25.259
How are you holding up?"

1:35:25.292 --> 1:35:27.461
I'm sorry, bro.
We don't talk about this shit.

1:35:27.494 --> 1:35:30.798
I'm-I'm crashing here because
I'm in the middle of a divorce,

1:35:30.831 --> 1:35:32.933
and you haven't asked me
about it once.

1:35:34.068 --> 1:35:35.202
I'm sorry.

1:35:36.403 --> 1:35:38.439
So, how's the divorce?

1:35:38.472 --> 1:35:41.242
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Okay.

1:35:41.275 --> 1:35:42.977
So...

1:35:44.278 --> 1:35:45.946
...what happened to you?

1:35:45.980 --> 1:35:49.250
Okay, you remember at Christmas
when Mom and Dad came?

1:35:49.283 --> 1:35:51.185
I asked Bobby to...

1:35:53.053 --> 1:35:55.022
I asked him to tone it down.

1:35:56.056 --> 1:35:58.325
I know. I know.
I fucked up. I panicked.

1:35:59.827 --> 1:36:01.895
Did you try

1:36:01.929 --> 1:36:03.864
-to get him back or...
-Yes.

1:36:03.897 --> 1:36:04.999
I mean, Bobby is the best,

1:36:05.032 --> 1:36:06.534
but he is
a stubborn son of a bitch.

1:36:06.568 --> 1:36:11.238
And do you love
this stubborn little bitch?

1:36:17.945 --> 1:36:20.214
Whatever. It's over.

1:36:20.247 --> 1:36:22.816
Bobby's strong.
He doesn't need me.

1:36:23.518 --> 1:36:25.152
He doesn't need anyone.

Hey, guys.
It's your girl Tamara.

1:36:31.593 --> 1:36:33.561
We're opening
the LGBT Museum tonight.

1:36:33.595 --> 1:36:35.229
Tonight is our grand opening,

1:36:35.262 --> 1:36:37.599
and we're gonna have
a wonderful time!

1:36:37.632 --> 1:36:39.066
Yeah!

1:36:39.099 --> 1:36:41.268
-What's up?
-What's up?

1:36:42.537 --> 1:36:45.306
Hi. I'm Leonardo da Vinci.

1:36:45.339 --> 1:36:47.074
I changed the world with my work

1:36:47.107 --> 1:36:50.144
as an inventor,
scientist and artist.

1:36:50.177 --> 1:36:53.615
But most importantly,
I may have been bi.

1:36:53.648 --> 1:36:56.183
Arrivederci.

1:37:02.222 --> 1:37:05.593
Congrats. You've made it
to the Obama administration.

1:37:05.627 --> 1:37:07.494
But what's that
around the corner?

1:37:14.101 --> 1:37:16.403
Okay, seriously,
this place is incredible.

1:37:16.437 --> 1:37:18.972
-Are you happy?
-I don't know.

1:37:19.006 --> 1:37:20.341
It's weird, you know?

1:37:20.374 --> 1:37:23.243
Like, this place was my dream,
then it happened.

1:37:24.211 --> 1:37:26.013
Why can't I answer
your question?

1:37:26.046 --> 1:37:28.650
-Okay, can I just say
one thing? -Yes.

1:37:28.683 --> 1:37:30.618
I know that
what he did was wrong,

1:37:30.652 --> 1:37:32.286
but you didn't have to argue
with his parents.

1:37:32.319 --> 1:37:34.589
I did, though.
Plus, I apologized.

1:37:34.622 --> 1:37:36.123
And he apologized, too.

1:37:36.156 --> 1:37:37.891
I just don't know
if I can trust him.

1:37:37.925 --> 1:37:39.493
He fucked up. People fuck up.

1:37:39.527 --> 1:37:40.961
Is there no part of you

1:37:40.994 --> 1:37:42.930
that wants to give him
a second chance?

1:37:43.931 --> 1:37:45.999
You know what it is?

1:37:46.033 --> 1:37:48.570
I just don't want
to want someone else this much.

1:37:48.603 --> 1:37:50.070
But you do.

1:37:50.104 --> 1:37:52.139
It doesn't make you look weak
to love someone.

1:37:52.172 --> 1:37:54.542
Vulnerability is not
a boner killer.

1:37:54.576 --> 1:37:56.377
I know you.

1:37:56.410 --> 1:37:58.513
I know that you've had
a million reasons

1:37:58.546 --> 1:38:00.515
to keep your guard up
all these years.

1:38:00.548 --> 1:38:02.015
But there are people out there

1:38:02.049 --> 1:38:03.250
worth letting
your guard down for.

1:38:03.283 --> 1:38:07.020
Were you happier
with him or without him?

1:38:07.054 --> 1:38:08.422
That's all that really matters.

1:38:08.455 --> 1:38:10.592
Can I tell you something
extremely embarrassing

1:38:10.625 --> 1:38:12.226
that I would only tell you?

1:38:12.259 --> 1:38:13.427
Yes.

1:38:13.460 --> 1:38:15.530
I wrote a song about him.

1:38:15.563 --> 1:38:17.532
I know! That's the only time

1:38:17.565 --> 1:38:18.600
I'm ever gonna talk about it.

1:38:18.633 --> 1:38:20.067
We're not talking about it.

1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:22.002
I didn't send it,
and I'm not sending it.

1:38:22.035 --> 1:38:24.071
Okay. Fine.

1:38:24.104 --> 1:38:27.141
I've just never seen you
that happy is all.

1:38:27.174 --> 1:38:28.976
And I love seeing it.

1:38:30.177 --> 1:38:31.613
Hi, guys.

1:38:31.646 --> 1:38:33.715
-Hi, sweetie.
-Ready to go dance?

1:38:33.748 --> 1:38:35.482
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

1:39:14.421 --> 1:39:16.290
Holy shit. He texted me.

1:39:16.323 --> 1:39:18.425
-Bobby texted me!
-Well, what'd he say?

1:39:18.459 --> 1:39:21.462
He said, "Hey, what's up?"

1:39:21.495 --> 1:39:23.063
"Hey, what's up?"

1:39:23.096 --> 1:39:24.566
-Fuck yeah, bro!
-Yeah?

1:39:24.599 --> 1:39:26.601
-That's what I'm talking about!
-Yeah? That's good? Yeah!

1:39:26.634 --> 1:39:28.068
It's great! "Hey, what's up?"

1:39:28.101 --> 1:39:30.204
"Hey, what's up?"
"Hey, what's up?"

1:39:30.237 --> 1:39:32.239
-No, wait. No, wait, wait.
-What?

1:39:32.272 --> 1:39:33.373
Okay, yeah.

1:39:33.407 --> 1:39:35.209
I-I'm gonna wait to text him
back, though, you know?

1:39:35.242 --> 1:39:37.311
Ah, shit.
I got to get to the gym.

1:39:37.344 --> 1:39:40.347
Aaron, what the fuck is up with
you and the CrossFit every day?

1:39:40.380 --> 1:39:42.550
Jesus! What are you people
all training for?

1:39:42.584 --> 1:39:43.718
You going to war?

1:39:43.751 --> 1:39:45.687
Stop playing it so cool.

1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:47.755
Just go and tell him
how you feel.

1:39:47.789 --> 1:39:49.757
Oh, what about you?
What about divorce?

1:39:49.791 --> 1:39:51.358
What about keeping it
young and fun?

1:39:51.391 --> 1:39:52.292
Oh, whatever.

1:39:52.326 --> 1:39:54.428
Straight people--
we're so set in our ways.

1:39:54.461 --> 1:39:56.764
But gay people--
you guys are all so--

1:39:56.798 --> 1:39:58.031
you're so smart.

1:39:58.065 --> 1:40:00.033
You're gonna figure it out.

1:40:00.067 --> 1:40:03.170
My story is not your story.

1:40:03.203 --> 1:40:05.239
Go write your own damn story.

1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:08.242
-Go! Now!
-Okay. Yeah.

1:40:09.343 --> 1:40:11.178
Hey.

1:40:14.749 --> 1:40:16.183
"Hey, what's up?"

1:40:16.216 --> 1:40:17.652
-"Hey, what's up?" Yeah!
-"Hey, what's up?"

1:40:39.439 --> 1:40:40.708
-Bobby?
-Yeah?

1:40:40.742 --> 1:40:42.577
-It's time for the toast.
-Okay, great.

1:40:42.610 --> 1:40:44.177
Okay.

1:40:53.287 --> 1:40:56.356
One of the hardest parts
of putting the museum together

1:40:56.390 --> 1:40:59.627
was figuring out what
the final exhibit would be.

1:40:59.661 --> 1:41:03.330
The message we'd leave people
with about who we are.

1:41:03.363 --> 1:41:06.701
But the truth is
we are not one thing.

1:41:06.734 --> 1:41:09.236
We are not a monolithic group.

1:41:09.269 --> 1:41:12.574
We are some of the smartest
and most self-reliant people

1:41:12.607 --> 1:41:14.207
you will ever meet.

1:41:14.241 --> 1:41:15.810
And we are so stupid.

1:41:17.144 --> 1:41:18.713
And we are a total mess.

1:41:18.746 --> 1:41:21.214
And we are great.

1:41:21.248 --> 1:41:23.450
We've been around since the
beginning of time, of course,

1:41:23.483 --> 1:41:26.320
and yet it still feels like
we're at the very beginning

1:41:26.353 --> 1:41:28.322
of being able to tell
our own stories.

1:41:28.355 --> 1:41:30.457
In many ways,
I think we're still

1:41:30.490 --> 1:41:32.527
getting to know
each other, really.

1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:35.329
Now, I'm just
a boring old cis white gay,

1:41:35.362 --> 1:41:36.831
but...

1:41:36.864 --> 1:41:39.299
one thing I have learned from

1:41:39.333 --> 1:41:42.336
my trans and bi
and nonbinary family is that

1:41:42.369 --> 1:41:46.206
happiness for all of us
comes from staying fluid,

1:41:46.239 --> 1:41:47.742
staying open to change.

1:41:47.775 --> 1:41:51.345
Open to being more than
just who you thought you were

1:41:51.378 --> 1:41:54.381
or more than what other people
assume you are.

1:41:54.414 --> 1:41:56.751
So this is a toast to all of us.

1:41:56.784 --> 1:41:59.654
We've come a long way.

1:41:59.687 --> 1:42:01.488
And there are a lot of people

1:42:01.522 --> 1:42:05.359
who deserved to live
long enough to be here tonight.

1:42:05.392 --> 1:42:09.429
And we are here,
and they are not.

1:42:10.665 --> 1:42:12.667
And we are very lucky.

1:42:15.536 --> 1:42:17.572
We are very lucky.

1:42:19.574 --> 1:42:21.609
I have no complaints.

1:42:29.851 --> 1:42:31.385
Hey.

1:42:34.555 --> 1:42:35.957
Hey.

1:42:35.990 --> 1:42:38.291
Um...

1:42:39.594 --> 1:42:41.929
Sorry, um-- Just, um--

1:42:41.963 --> 1:42:43.831
One more thing. Sorry, hold on.

1:42:43.865 --> 1:42:45.700
I'm gonna do it.
Let's do it. Let's do it.

1:42:51.939 --> 1:42:53.675
Hi.

1:42:57.712 --> 1:42:59.413
So, um,

1:42:59.446 --> 1:43:02.583
this is a little special
something I wrote for tonight,

1:43:02.617 --> 1:43:05.252
and I didn't think
I would actually have

1:43:05.285 --> 1:43:06.954
a reason to sing it.

1:43:06.988 --> 1:43:09.222
And I haven't sung in front of
people in a very long time,

1:43:09.256 --> 1:43:10.357
so forgive me.

1:43:10.390 --> 1:43:12.459
But, um, tonight is about love,

1:43:12.492 --> 1:43:15.429
and we've seen
a lot of tortured gay cowboys

1:43:15.462 --> 1:43:17.999
played by a lot of
straight actors over the years.

1:43:19.767 --> 1:43:22.737
So, this is a love song
from one gay cowboy to another,

1:43:22.770 --> 1:43:27.508
inspired by everyone's favorite
LGBTQ+ icon,

1:43:27.542 --> 1:43:29.677
