WEBVTT

00:06.215 --> 00:09.009
- Did you want two more?
- I want something else.

00:09.093 --> 00:10.511
Ooh,
I'll have one of those.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.035
Russell, is this
the finale already?

00:35.119 --> 00:37.705
- Yep.
- But there was supposed to be another act.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.124
- What happened to Lidia?
- Lidia moved back to Ohio.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.500
In the last hour?

00:41.584 --> 00:43.002
Life's full of surprises.

00:43.002 --> 00:44.378
She left her snake.

00:44.462 --> 00:46.213
And her dog.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.174
Never mind.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.595
Ow!

01:14.617 --> 01:15.701
The curtain's stuck.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.828
- It happens.
- Yes, but what should we do?

01:17.912 --> 01:20.164
Hey. I separate nuts and bolts.

01:20.164 --> 01:22.666
See? I put nuts with the nuts
and bolts with the bolts.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.585
You are a stripper
who doesn't take anything off

01:24.585 --> 01:26.003
and just stands there
yelling at people.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.087
This is neither of our problems.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.089
Okay, that's not what...

01:29.173 --> 01:30.800
Never mind.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.112
Well, that's the end of the... show.

01:52.196 --> 01:55.491
I hope it's been an evening
you will never...

01:55.491 --> 01:57.701
ever forget.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.620
You've been a great audience.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.205
Please get home safe...

02:01.205 --> 02:03.165
...and tip the...

02:03.249 --> 02:04.667
tip the waitresses!

02:04.667 --> 02:06.001
They're armed!

02:06.085 --> 02:07.795
Thank you and...

02:07.795 --> 02:09.338
good... Really?

02:14.635 --> 02:16.387
Charlie, you guys
are supposed to play softer

02:16.387 --> 02:17.721
when I talk, remember?

02:17.805 --> 02:18.973
I never know
when you're gonna talk.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.850
Basically,
any time I come out here,

02:20.850 --> 02:21.851
I'm gonna talk.

02:21.851 --> 02:23.227
It's your funeral.

02:23.227 --> 02:25.020
Lipstick.

02:31.944 --> 02:35.030
Boise, we still got a couple
of kinks to work out here.

02:35.114 --> 02:37.408
- Oh, yeah? Like what?
- Well, the curtain stayed up,

02:37.408 --> 02:39.285
the spot never hit me,
the band played too loud

02:39.285 --> 02:40.870
while I was talking,
my mic cut out.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.621
- You want to write this down?
- No, I do not.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.665
This is looking like
a half-assed burlesque show.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.166
It is a half-assed
burlesque show.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.877
- Boise...
- Let's see how tomorrow goes.

02:47.877 --> 02:50.087
- You keep saying that.
- Well, I'm a hopeful guy.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.589
Come on.
These are not hard fixes.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.674
If we had a sound check,
we'd know if the mic is working.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.343
Mic works. The sound guy just
wasn't behind the board yet.

02:56.427 --> 02:59.179
- And the curtain and...
- Same guy who runs the board runs the curtain.

02:59.263 --> 03:00.806
Maybe we could get a different
guy to run the curtain.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.975
What am I, the WPA?
A fucking chicken in every pot?

03:02.975 --> 03:04.894
You think I got
the kind of money to hire a guy

03:04.894 --> 03:06.604
just to run the curtain?

03:06.604 --> 03:08.022
What's he do?

03:08.022 --> 03:09.356
Huh.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.483
Congratulations!
You're the new curtain guy!

03:11.567 --> 03:12.985
Now, about the finale.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.613
Do you gals have any idea
what you're doing out there?

03:15.613 --> 03:17.281
- What do you mean?
- When you came out onstage,

03:17.281 --> 03:18.741
some of you looked confused.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.367
- Tilly?
- I just follow her.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.369
We should do the finale earlier
in the show.

03:22.453 --> 03:23.662
We're tired by then.

03:23.746 --> 03:25.456
Or some rehearsal might help.

03:25.456 --> 03:27.666
Unless the crashing into
each other is a creative choice.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.084
No, that just happens.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.336
And you--

03:30.336 --> 03:31.879
- are you in your bra?
- Yeah.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.505
- Why?
- Well, I can't go out there naked.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.174
- There's laws.
- Where's your costume?

03:35.174 --> 03:36.675
Oh, the strap broke.
I can't fix it,

03:36.759 --> 03:38.177
and Dribbles ate my pasty.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.012
Get me your costume.
I'll have Zelda fix it.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.264
- Who's Zelda?
- I think she's the one who wears balloons

03:42.348 --> 03:43.682
and pops 'em with her nails.

03:43.766 --> 03:45.392
Shit. More competition.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.561
Hey,
it's movie night tonight!

03:47.645 --> 03:50.397
Oh, I love movie night.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.941
You gonna stay for movie night,
Midge?

03:51.941 --> 03:53.692
Can't tonight.
I'm late for something.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.319
Next time. I promise.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.571
All of this has to get better!

03:57.655 --> 03:59.990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

04:00.074 --> 04:01.200
- Boise.
- I hear you.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.869
They hear you.
Everyone hears you!

04:09.959 --> 04:11.293
To new friends.

04:11.377 --> 04:12.670
And the booze they bring.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.631
<i>And I'll move a mountain ♪</i>

04:15.631 --> 04:17.257
Mmm. Perfect.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.551
- I'm really glad we finally did this.
- Me too.

04:19.635 --> 04:20.594
I've been pulling
all the late shifts

04:20.678 --> 04:21.595
at the hospital this month.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.681
The other doctors have families, so...

04:23.681 --> 04:25.015
Don't worry. I like eating late.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.141
Comes with the microphone.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.142
It's very Spanish.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.519
- The microphone?
- Eating late.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.853
I lived there for a year.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.939
They don't sit down till 10:00.
Even the kids.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.857
- It's very different.
- Oh, you got to live in Spain?

04:33.941 --> 04:34.858
Was it amazing?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.527
And delicious. The steak...

04:36.527 --> 04:37.945
I was supposed to go this year.
For work.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.947
But it fell through.
Some other time.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.157
Spain.

04:42.241 --> 04:46.078
So, how long have you lived
on <i>el Lado Superior Oeste?</i>

04:46.078 --> 04:46.996
Hmm?

04:46.996 --> 04:48.664
The Upper West Side. Spanish.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.958
Got it. Well, I was born
on the Upper West Side.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.293
I actually live in
the same building I grew up in.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.712
<i>Eso es increíble.</i>

04:54.712 --> 04:56.338
That's... good?

04:56.422 --> 04:58.090
- <i>Sí.</i>
- I could tell by the smile

04:58.090 --> 04:59.675
and the fact that you didn't use
the word "cancer."

04:59.675 --> 05:00.926
Though you're a doctor,
so "cancer" could be

05:01.010 --> 05:02.094
your pickup line.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.430
<i>Eres una dama divertida.</i>

05:04.430 --> 05:06.348
You're very good.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.350
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- Ah, timing.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.768
Fill 'er up, please.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.562
- And I think we're ready to order.
- Okay.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.480
Uh, We'll both have a
<i>filete meio rara,</i>

05:13.564 --> 05:16.650
<i>y una guarnicion de espinacas.</i>

05:16.734 --> 05:19.278
That's a medium-rare steak
with a side of spinach.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.904
He lived in Spain.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.614
I'll be right back
with your drink.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.367
So, you're a comedian.

05:26.493 --> 05:30.080
Oh, that's English.
Sorry. Yes. I am a comedian.

05:30.164 --> 05:34.501
And where do you get
the ideas for your jokes?

05:36.628 --> 05:38.505
Will you excuse me a moment?

05:43.594 --> 05:45.429
I wore the wrong hat.

05:45.429 --> 05:49.933
<i>Jamon iberico de bellota
el mejor del mundo.</i>

05:50.017 --> 05:51.268
Do you like ham?

05:51.268 --> 05:52.519
No.

05:52.603 --> 05:56.565
No.
Spanish.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.400
You are funny.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.986
Have you ever seen a bullfight?

06:01.070 --> 06:02.821
- Miriam!
- Susie.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.907
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry to interrupt,

06:04.907 --> 06:06.784
- but your kid is very sick.
- Oh, no.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.535
Yeah, he's throwing up
all over the place.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.412
Your rug's a total goner.
I think he needs a doctor.

06:10.496 --> 06:11.914
I am so sorry, Liam.
I have to go.

06:11.914 --> 06:14.458
- Well, should I come?
- No. He needs a doctor.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.044
- I am a doctor.
- Oh. Well, yeah, but probably not the kind he needs.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.254
- I'm a pediatrician.
- He's an adult.
- She said he's five.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.090
Will you just come and check
on your goddamn kid?!

06:21.090 --> 06:22.674
Yes. I am so sorry
about this.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.469
Uh, we'll try it again.
Really. Call me.

You coulda told me
he was a fucking doctor.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.296
I know. I'm sorry.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.132
If I'd have known, I would've
said that the kid

07:03.132 --> 07:04.424
had been abducted or something.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.051
I promise to tell you next time.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.636
And what do we need a code for?

07:07.636 --> 07:09.847
All you have to do is call and
say, "I picked another loser,

07:09.847 --> 07:11.306
come the fuck down and save me."

07:11.390 --> 07:13.350
We need the code in case he
walks by and hears me.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.893
I don't want to hurt
his feelings.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.937
Well, all I know is this is the
third crappy date

07:16.937 --> 07:18.147
you've been on this month.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.232
You gotta kiss some frogs.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.775
You can't date civilians.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.819
- Well, who am I going to date?
- Someone in the business.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.571
I am not gonna date a comic.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.407
A comic? God, no. You fuck that
frog before you date a comic.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.535
- Then who?
- I don't know.

07:31.535 --> 07:32.828
How about a ventriloquist?

07:32.828 --> 07:34.538
Why the hell would I
date a ventriloquist?

07:34.538 --> 07:35.914
He goes around with a toy.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.374
You've got kids.
Seems like a slam dunk to me.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.417
You've gotta be kidding.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.668
At least he's bound to
have a personality.

07:39.668 --> 07:40.836
Two, actually.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.671
- A ventriloquist?
- Yes.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.047
A man who sits with a wooden
version of a tiny man

07:44.131 --> 07:45.048
on his lap and tries
to make it talk.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.216
That's who you want me
to date?

07:46.300 --> 07:48.010
When I look at you,
I see ventriloquist.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.222
Hey, Susie...

07:52.306 --> 07:53.724
What, Miriam?

07:53.724 --> 07:57.436
- When was the last relationship that you had?
- What?

07:57.436 --> 08:00.564
We always talk about me and my
relationships. What about you?

08:00.564 --> 08:01.732
I haven't seen you
with anybody

08:01.732 --> 08:03.734
- since we've been together.
- So?

08:03.734 --> 08:06.612
- Just curious about your life.
- My life is you. That's it.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.947
Thinking about you.
Talking about you.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.742
Waiting for you, rescuing you
from bullshit dates.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.410
- I don't have time for anything else.
- Yeah, but...

08:13.410 --> 08:15.204
As soon as I get you off my
fucking hands

08:15.204 --> 08:17.539
and make you a star, I can shove
you out on an iceberg

08:17.623 --> 08:19.208
and focus on something else.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.418
Fine.

08:23.587 --> 08:24.796
What?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.342
Maybe I've been hanging out
with you for too long,

08:28.342 --> 08:30.469
but I actually do think
you wore the wrong hat.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.599
Two years ago, you
directed Vertigo,

08:35.599 --> 08:38.518
<i>Terrific film. Last year, it
was</i> North By Northwest,

08:38.602 --> 08:40.479
<i>which completely ruined my love</i>

08:40.479 --> 08:42.064
<i>of long walks through cornfields.</i>

08:42.064 --> 08:44.107
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

08:44.191 --> 08:47.569
<i>And now we have</i> Psycho, <i>which
I understand is very scary.</i>

08:47.653 --> 08:49.571
<i>So, let me ask you,
Mr. Hitchcock,</i>

08:49.655 --> 08:51.490
<i>because I'm curious:
what scares you?</i>

08:51.490 --> 08:53.450
<i>Hard-boiled eggs.</i>

08:53.450 --> 08:56.203
<i>Hard-boiled eggs.
I-I was not expecting that.</i>

08:56.203 --> 08:59.373
<i>I was thinking more
spiders, or ex-wives.</i>

08:59.373 --> 09:01.458
<i>I find them disgusting.</i>

09:01.458 --> 09:04.878
<i>Do you not find hard-boiled
eggs disgusting?</i>

09:04.962 --> 09:07.631
<i>I confess, I have not put
much thought into it.</i>

09:07.631 --> 09:09.383
<i>Well, you should...</i>

09:14.346 --> 09:16.348
Ethan, if you
have to make pee-pee,

09:16.348 --> 09:18.850
just pee-pee
and go back to bed.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.310
It's not Ethan.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.562
Papa, if you have to
make pee-pee,

09:22.646 --> 09:24.773
just pee-pee
and go back to bed.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.817
I don't have to make pee-pee!

09:26.817 --> 09:29.736
Could I have a quick word
with you, please?

09:29.820 --> 09:31.446
Hold on.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.617
Ow.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.870
- What time is it?
- It's midnight.

09:38.954 --> 09:42.207
And Susie is blasting
that damn TV again.

09:42.291 --> 09:43.667
She's been having
trouble sleeping.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.502
The TV helps her relax.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.170
Has she tried sleeping pills?

09:47.254 --> 09:50.340
Your mother has a gallon jug
of them in the closet.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.301
She says they make her
loopy the next day.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.594
Same with your mother,
but who can tell?

09:54.678 --> 09:56.930
Who says my pills make me loopy?

09:57.014 --> 09:58.807
I was just saying to Miriam

09:58.807 --> 10:01.768
that Susie has stayed here
longer than expected.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.896
Her friend dying in her
apartment really threw her.

10:04.980 --> 10:08.567
I'm sorry, but when my close
friend Mordecai Glickman

10:08.567 --> 10:10.444
died playing squash,

10:10.444 --> 10:13.697
I was back on the squash court
at 6:00 the next morning.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.490
I forgot that it was
to play Mordecai,

10:15.574 --> 10:17.534
so it was all for naught,
but you get my point.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.870
Her time here
does seem endless.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.122
And I told Asher
he could bunk here.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.167
Should I steer him to
some godforsaken motel?

10:25.167 --> 10:28.170
There's room for Asher. It'll
be tight, but we'll get by.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.005
Can I get anyone anything?

10:30.005 --> 10:32.799
Zelda, it's so late.
Why are you here?

10:32.883 --> 10:35.093
Miss Susie is using
a plate and a glass,

10:35.177 --> 10:37.387
so I stayed late
so I can wash them.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.930
Zelda, I'll wash Susie's
plates when she's done.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.099
- But that's my job, Miss Miriam.
- It doesn't matter.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.560
So I should go to
the comedy buildings

10:43.560 --> 10:46.563
and make with the jokes...
because it doesn't matter?

10:46.688 --> 10:48.690
Is the TV too loud?

10:48.774 --> 10:51.318
What TV? I didn't hear
the TV. Was it on?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.695
- I can turn it down.
- You don't need to turn it down.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.114
I'm gonna find my own place
any day, I promise.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.575
Stay as long as you like,
Susie. Really.

10:58.575 --> 11:02.371
Yes, yes, the invitation
is open-ended.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.081
Good night, Susie.

11:04.081 --> 11:07.542
- See you in the morning.
- Yeah.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.878
What are you
still doing here?

11:16.593 --> 11:18.220
- Excuse me, Abe?
- Yeah.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.554
There's a guy here.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.056
He's been sitting in the hallway
for half an hour.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.433
We finally asked, and he said
he was a friend of yours.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.435
- Of mine?
- Then he said, "Check that.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.437
Abe and I used to be friends,
because a friend doesn't

11:27.521 --> 11:29.272
stab a friend in the back
with a rusty knife

11:29.356 --> 11:31.108
dipped in arsenic, then wrap
a guitar string..."

11:31.108 --> 11:33.902
I got it. Thank you, Isobel.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.368
- Asher.
- Abe. Hello.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.120
Why didn't you come get me?

11:43.120 --> 11:45.372
I could see you were busy
typing-- it looked important.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.208
Maybe you were tattling
on a sick relative

11:48.208 --> 11:51.336
or ratting out your son
for stealing a Necco Wafer

11:51.420 --> 11:52.754
when he was 12.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.214
Moving on.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.425
I have us all set up
with Michael Kessler

11:56.425 --> 11:58.927
to deal with the FBI,
so feel at ease.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.346
He's a great attorney.
Best in the business.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.640
Sacco and Vanzetti had
the best in the business, too.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.225
Must have been a great comfort

12:05.225 --> 12:06.768
as they sat
in their electric chairs

12:06.852 --> 12:08.812
listening to their brains melt.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.189
I'm almost done here.
Come sit with me.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.108
- I don't want to bother you.
- You want to

12:13.108 --> 12:15.819
walk around the Village
a bit? Get some souvenirs?

12:15.819 --> 12:17.863
I stepped on a spent condom
coming in here,

12:17.863 --> 12:19.781
so I'm all set for souvenirs.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.742
Yes, good. Okay.
I'll be right out.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.327
Don't rush.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.999
Swear I had coffee cups
when I left the factory.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.001
- Just use a bowl.
- I don't have bowls.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.044
You don't have bowls?
Don't you eat soup?

12:33.128 --> 12:35.338
I don't trust soup.
It tells you it's food,

12:35.422 --> 12:36.840
but you eat it,
and you're never full.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.342
Feels like a scam.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.927
Hello?

12:41.011 --> 12:42.762
<i>- Hello, Joely.</i>
- Hi, Ma.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.265
<i>- It's your mother, Shirley.</i>
- I know, Ma.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.808
What can I do for you? <i>- Oh, nothing.</i>

12:46.892 --> 12:48.560
<i>I was just checking in.
How's your new apartment?</i>

12:48.560 --> 12:51.188
It's great. <i>- So you don't miss us at all?</i>

12:51.188 --> 12:52.606
What do you need, Ma?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.733
I was just wondering where
you're gonna be on Friday night.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.359
<i>- I'll be at the club.</i>
- You're sure?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.360
I'm sure. <i>- Around 8:00?</i>

12:57.444 --> 12:59.446
- Why, Ma?
- No reason.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.198
- Is your blue suit pressed?
- Why, Ma?

13:01.198 --> 13:03.241
Because you look very nice
in your blue suit.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.410
Thank you, but... <i>- Well, it was nice catching up.</i>

13:05.494 --> 13:08.163
Remember, wear your blue suit
Friday night. I love you.

13:08.163 --> 13:11.166
And your room is here when you want it. <i>- Ma?</i>

13:11.166 --> 13:12.417
Wait, Ma.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.252
So, when this soup
tells you it's food,

13:14.336 --> 13:17.088
does it speak or spell it out
in little alphabet letters or...

13:17.172 --> 13:19.591
I think it's time
for you to meet my parents.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.260
- Did you hear me?
- Nope.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.762
I put them off
for as long as I could,

13:23.762 --> 13:25.597
- but we are out of time.
- Nope.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.641
- We have no choice.
- Nope.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.351
- Mei.
- Are you insane?

13:29.351 --> 13:32.020
- I know it'll be awkward.
- It'll be a disaster!

13:32.020 --> 13:34.147
Joel. I mean...

13:34.231 --> 13:35.690
They won't care
that you're short.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.276
But they will care that I look
like their dry cleaner.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.612
You're in luck. My mother
does not use a dry cleaner.

13:40.612 --> 13:43.114
Are you aware of all
the colorfully descriptive words

13:43.198 --> 13:44.991
- that'll come to their minds when they see me?
- No.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.618
- You want me to rattle them off?
- No, thanks.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.203
I'll just write them down.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.038
I've heard these terms
my entire life,

13:50.038 --> 13:51.831
so the list
will be comprehensive.

13:51.915 --> 13:52.874
This is not helping.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.292
Mei.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.919
- Mei.
- Hold on.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.464
Okay. You made your point.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.049
You think I'm an idiot?

14:01.049 --> 14:02.968
I know that there's
a lot of ugly shit out there

14:02.968 --> 14:05.136
that people...
Oh, now, that one, you made up.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.638
That was my nickname
in kindergarten.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.640
Look, I know my parents.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.101
You being Chinese--
yes, it will be a surprise.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.562
But trust me, it will not
be their biggest problem.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.021
- No?
- You not being Jewish,

14:15.105 --> 14:16.231
that's gonna wake the neighbors.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.191
Right. They don't want you
with a gentile.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.402
And a Chinese girl
is like a double gentile.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.237
Triple gentile. More.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.489
Basically, you're walking in
with the Lawrence Welk singers.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.200
Well, what's the alternative,
huh? We're together.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.578
They have to find out.
Your parents know.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.288
Yes, they do.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.707
Would you like to know all
the colorfully descriptive words

14:33.707 --> 14:35.250
that came to their minds
when they found out?

14:35.250 --> 14:36.960
I'll just write 'em down.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.712
I'm gonna need a lot more paper.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.714
Do you understand
what's happening here?

14:40.714 --> 14:43.091
My mother's sending girls
to my workplace.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.509
One's coming Friday,

14:44.593 --> 14:46.428
and I have no proof
she's not sending the rabbi.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.638
Well, he's not much of a rabbi
if he's working on Friday.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.223
She won't stop till I'm married.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.433
I'm okay with being a mistress.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.976
- Well, I'm not.
- You were with Midge.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.603
Hey.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.021
- Sorry.
- What the fuck?

14:56.021 --> 14:58.523
I know. I'm sorry. I am. But...

15:00.108 --> 15:02.027
I can't.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.904
- I just can't.
- Mei.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.866
Mei.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.368
We have to discuss this.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.578
Mei?

15:12.662 --> 15:14.581
You can't just run.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.458
- I know where you live.
- No, you don't.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.127
No, I don't. Fuck me.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.464
But what's funny is...

15:22.464 --> 15:24.966
- Get this, get this.
- Yeah, this is fucking great.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.594
Come on, all you told me
is you cut some guy's balls off.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.554
Right, right. We cut them off.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.556
But we stuffed them
into the other guy's mouth.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.141
And the other guy's balls

15:33.141 --> 15:35.393
- got stuffed into the first guy's mouth.
- Yeah.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.228
Yeah, when you cut off
a guy's balls,

15:37.312 --> 15:39.022
you're supposed to stuff them
in the mouth

15:39.022 --> 15:40.815
of the guy
the fucking balls belong to.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.526
So we were like, "What do we do?
Switch them back?"

15:43.610 --> 15:46.112
How do you do that? I mean,
rigor mortis was setting in.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.614
Their jaws were clenching tight.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.366
Yeah, yeah. So,
we were weighing our options.

15:49.366 --> 15:52.160
Then we heard sirens,
so we decided to split.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.244
I know
you make half this shit up,

15:53.328 --> 15:54.329
but it's still fucking great.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.748
Yeah,
we really don't make things up.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.500
- Hey, can I get another Coke?
- Hey, get two.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.876
This is on us.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.128
Whatever you want.
We haven't seen you in forever.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.214
Mm, been too busy
licking my wounds.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.508
Ah, Shy Baldwin.
He sings like an angel

16:06.508 --> 16:09.010
- but sounds like a douche.
- I don't want to talk about it.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.638
Well, he's Giancana's anyway,
so we can't touch him.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.390
Right now, I'm just focused
on finding a place to live.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.599
I'm crashing with Midge,

16:14.683 --> 16:16.559
but her family's
driving me nuts.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.603
- What's your price point?
- For an apartment?

16:18.687 --> 16:19.604
Well, be a stretch,

16:19.688 --> 16:20.939
but I could afford
a nickel a month.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.941
Know any apartments
going for a nickel a month?

16:24.025 --> 16:26.736
I, uh...
I think we could help you here.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.905
- Really? How?
- We know a place.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.032
- We'll take you later today.
- Great.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.492
- Thanks.
- And if it works out,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.953
we can write this lunch off
on our taxes.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.705
Taxes.

Excuse me.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.349
Excuse me, sir?

17:38.433 --> 17:40.852
Hi. I was wondering...

17:44.439 --> 17:46.274
Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:46.274 --> 17:48.777
Hi. Sorry. I was just wondering

17:48.777 --> 17:51.196
- if perhaps you could help me with something.
- Help you with what?

17:51.196 --> 17:54.365
Well, I am looking for a place,
a bar,

17:54.449 --> 17:57.786
where someone like me
but not me-- a friend--

17:57.786 --> 18:00.997
could maybe drink
with someone else like me.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.499
- What?
- You know,

18:02.499 --> 18:04.751
a place where a lady
could drink with another lady?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.419
I can't help you.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.215
Excuse me.
I am looking for a bar

18:10.215 --> 18:12.801
where women like me can drink
with other women like me.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.385
Or just women in general.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.845
They don't have to be like me.
They just have to be...

18:15.929 --> 18:17.055
- You're a cop.
- What?

18:17.055 --> 18:18.723
No, I'm not a cop.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.517
This is Dior!

18:20.517 --> 18:22.852
Excuse me. I am not a cop.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.938
I have a record.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.066
Hi. I'm not a cop.
I was just wondering...

18:28.066 --> 18:30.068
Hello. I am not a cop.
I was won...

18:30.068 --> 18:32.111
Hello. Not a cop.
I was just wondering...

18:32.195 --> 18:33.905
Hi. I'm not a cop. I'm not...

18:33.905 --> 18:35.657
Not a cop. I...

18:35.657 --> 18:37.909
I am not a cop.

18:44.165 --> 18:47.460
- So, you have a friend?
- I'm sorry?

18:47.544 --> 18:50.880
I believe you were making
an inquiry for a friend?

18:50.964 --> 18:53.049
Oh. Yes. I was.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.343
My friend. Yes.
I was just wondering

18:55.343 --> 18:56.636
- if maybe...
- I know two or three places

18:56.636 --> 18:58.012
you might be looking for.

18:58.096 --> 19:01.015
You do? Oh,
that would be wonderful.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.351
And I assume there is no friend.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.228
No, there is a friend. Really.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.229
If you insist.

19:06.229 --> 19:07.647
I do. She is.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.775
Okay. And this friend,
i-is she like you?

19:10.859 --> 19:11.860
- Me?
- Yeah.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.028
Well, anatomically.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.029
Does she dress like you?

19:15.113 --> 19:16.865
Like me? Oh, no.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.491
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.702
She definitely does not.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.621
Sorry. I was just picturing her

19:23.705 --> 19:27.375
in my kumquat daisy dress
with reverse pattern hat.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.460
It's good.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.964
Oh, God, the corset.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.591
So it's not a very good friend.

19:34.591 --> 19:35.967
No, it is.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.136
Sorry.
Mm.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.762
Sorry. I'm back.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.347
- I missed you.
- You were saying?

19:41.431 --> 19:43.433
There's this new place.
It just opened.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.435
I hear it's very welcoming

19:45.435 --> 19:47.312
to a mixture
of different attires.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.397
- It's right on...
- Wait.

19:51.399 --> 19:54.319
Go ahead. Oh, is it okay
if I write this down?

19:54.319 --> 19:57.363
You're gonna have to eat
that paper later.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.656
A joke.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.116
- It's right up...
- Wait.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.368
You're not a cop, are you?

20:02.452 --> 20:05.538
- This is Dior, too.
- Ooh.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.498
He's not there.

20:07.582 --> 20:09.375
He's there. Give him time.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.711
So far I've heard six rings
and zero answers.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.046
Michael Kessler's
office.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.672
Oh, great,
they decided to pick up.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.966
<i>- Pardon?</i>
- Y-Yes, hello.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.551
Uh, can you hear me okay?

20:18.635 --> 20:19.969
<i>I can hear you fine.</i>

20:20.053 --> 20:23.348
It's Abe Weissman
and Asher Friedman for Michael.

20:23.348 --> 20:26.184
Yes, well, Michael
is just on his way back from...

20:26.184 --> 20:28.478
- What?
- This thing of yours

20:28.478 --> 20:30.104
- is not working.
- Could you repeat that?

20:30.188 --> 20:32.065
This thing of yours
is not working!

20:32.065 --> 20:33.608
Not you. Her.

20:33.608 --> 20:35.318
<i>Michael is just coming
up the stairs. Hold, please.</i>

20:35.318 --> 20:36.819
Oh, great,
now they've got us on hold.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.404
He's coming up the stairs.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.822
<i>- Michael!
- What?</i>

20:39.906 --> 20:42.116
Abe Friedman
is on the phone for you!

20:42.200 --> 20:44.035
She can't even get
the names right.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.579
<i>- Shit. Hold on, hold on. I'm coming.</i>
- Oh, good.

20:46.663 --> 20:47.747
he sounds very professional. <i>-</i>

20:47.747 --> 20:49.791
Is that a cat?
Does he have a cat?

20:49.791 --> 20:52.210
Is he coming? <i>- Michael's coming. Michael!</i>

20:52.210 --> 20:54.712
I'm coming, geez!
Keep your pants on.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.589
How long
is this fucking staircase?

20:56.673 --> 20:57.840
<i>Hello.</i>

20:57.924 --> 20:59.550
Michael, it's Abe Weissman

20:59.634 --> 21:01.010
and Asher Friedman. <i>- Right.</i>

21:01.094 --> 21:02.679
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Peachy. How's your cat?

21:02.679 --> 21:05.223
- Good?
- Michael, last we spoke,

21:05.223 --> 21:06.557
you said you were going to talk

21:06.641 --> 21:08.685
to someone
at the FBI field office.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.353
Were you able to do that?

21:10.353 --> 21:11.896
Yeah, yeah, I did, and I had

21:11.980 --> 21:14.440
<i>an incredibly productive
conversation with him.</i>

21:14.524 --> 21:16.651
Abe, are you purposefully
trying to torture me?

21:16.651 --> 21:18.861
We didn't get that, Michael! <i>-</i>

21:18.945 --> 21:20.863
Oh, Jesus Christ. <i>- I was saying</i>

21:20.947 --> 21:22.407
<i>I spoke to the guy,
and I got good news.</i>

21:22.407 --> 21:24.909
<i>They have nothing on you. Nothing.</i>

21:24.993 --> 21:26.619
<i>Some stuffed shirt
read your column</i>

21:26.703 --> 21:28.579
<i>and got his feathers ruffled
and kicked it down the chain,</i>

21:28.663 --> 21:29.664
<i>but it's going nowhere.</i>

21:29.664 --> 21:30.790
Really? <i>- Think about it.</i>

21:30.790 --> 21:32.166
<i>You broke
into a federal building</i>

21:32.250 --> 21:33.251
<i>one night. Minor.</i>

21:33.251 --> 21:34.919
<i>You lit a small fire. Bigger,</i>

21:35.003 --> 21:36.879
<i>but the damage was tiny,
and no one got hurt.</i>

21:36.963 --> 21:38.548
<i>The next year,
they tore the building down</i>

21:38.548 --> 21:39.841
<i>to build something new,
and everyone</i>

21:39.841 --> 21:40.925
<i>who would give a shit is dead.</i>

21:41.009 --> 21:42.176
<i>So this is a big, fat nothing.</i>

21:42.260 --> 21:43.511
It's a big, fat nothing.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.513
<i>They still want to meet
to get something on the record,</i>

21:45.513 --> 21:47.890
<i>but you don't even have to do it
at an FBI office.</i>

21:47.974 --> 21:50.351
<i>They'll come to you,
and it'll be over in a flash.</i>

21:50.435 --> 21:51.728
<i>-
- Oh, my God.</i>

21:51.728 --> 21:53.646
Over? As in "over," over?

21:53.730 --> 21:55.565
<i>Over as in "forever."</i>

21:55.565 --> 21:57.316
- It's gonna be over.
- Forever!

21:57.400 --> 21:59.068
Over forever!
I don't believe it!

21:59.152 --> 22:01.029
This is fantastic!

22:01.029 --> 22:02.989
I love this cat!

22:06.993 --> 22:08.578
Dorothy Parker never forgave you.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.413
Oh, Dorothy Parker never knew who I was.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.373
Dorothy Parker
had a crush on you, Asher.

22:12.457 --> 22:15.043
- You boasted about it.
- Well, she did follow me

22:15.043 --> 22:16.794
into the men's room
at the Algonquin once,

22:16.878 --> 22:18.755
but that was before
the incident with the hat.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.798
Asher was
a very good-looking young man.

22:20.882 --> 22:23.801
Sort of
a barrel-chested strongman type.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.803
I used to lift weights
with Johnny Weissmuller.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.638
Tarzan himself.
Is that <i>meshuggeneh?</i>

22:27.722 --> 22:28.681
Hey, don't hold out.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.308
What happened
to Dorothy Parker's hat?

22:30.308 --> 22:33.102
- I sat on it.
- Oh, dear.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.938
Second time at the round table,
I sat, I listened,

22:36.022 --> 22:37.273
they said clever things.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.733
An hour later, I stood,

22:38.733 --> 22:40.735
and the damn hat
is stuck to my ass.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.904
So, Dorothy sizes me up

22:42.904 --> 22:44.322
and says, "A poem.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.449
Today I entered with a hat

22:46.449 --> 22:49.243
And now it sits
where someone shat."

22:49.327 --> 22:51.913
Crazy, the things that happen,

22:51.913 --> 22:54.540
- that I've been through.
- How about our short, unsuccessful stint

22:54.624 --> 22:56.000
as furniture movers, Asher?

22:56.084 --> 22:57.460
Oh. That piano.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.337
How we thought
we could move a piano.

22:59.337 --> 23:01.297
Up a flight of stairs.
A baby grand.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.840
- Oh, my God.
- I remember this.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.217
Two hours to get it up,

23:04.217 --> 23:06.385
ten seconds to watch it
tumble down the stairs

23:06.469 --> 23:07.887
and land on a squirrel

23:07.887 --> 23:09.555
- on Bank Street.
- Ooh.
- Oh, God.

23:09.639 --> 23:13.142
- What was that? Spring of '27?
- Uh, fall, I think.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.937
I was in the thick of my work
at Columbia.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.855
It may even have been late '26.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.357
No. No, it had to be '27,

23:19.357 --> 23:21.150
because that's when Rosie and I
were seeing each other.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.902
I'm sorry. One more time?

23:22.902 --> 23:24.070
More ancient history.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.446
She showed up
for our first date

23:25.530 --> 23:27.156
with that Louise Brooks haircut.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.616
Remember? With the bangs?

23:28.616 --> 23:29.784
- Unfortunately.
- Ah,

23:29.784 --> 23:31.452
I remember that haircut, too.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.037
I'm sorry, hold on.

23:33.121 --> 23:35.748
You two went out together?
And you had bangs?

23:35.832 --> 23:37.458
Oh, it was all so long ago.

23:37.542 --> 23:38.751
Where were you, Papa?

23:38.835 --> 23:40.795
I was dating Tarzan at the time.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.880
Wait. Wait, wait.

23:42.964 --> 23:44.590
Was this before you two
were together?

23:44.674 --> 23:46.509
- It was in between.
- In between?

23:46.509 --> 23:48.928
- You-you had an intermission?
- We broke up for a while.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.221
You did?

23:50.221 --> 23:52.140
I made a young man's mistake

23:52.140 --> 23:53.683
and told your mother
I couldn't see her

23:53.683 --> 23:56.269
because I needed to focus
on my PhD.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.396
Who could focus when you're
with the beautiful Rosie?

23:58.396 --> 23:59.772
Oh, stop.

23:59.856 --> 24:00.982
We went together,
what, one month?

24:00.982 --> 24:02.358
- Two months?
- Somewhere in there.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.442
And you knew?

24:03.526 --> 24:04.819
I had to tell him
20 times,

24:04.819 --> 24:06.279
but he finally seemed
to hear me.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.405
And by then,
I had gotten back together

24:07.405 --> 24:09.490
with Delores. Wife number one.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.576
I was not as lucky
as Abe and Rosie,

24:11.576 --> 24:13.870
- that's for sure.
- I'll grab us another bottle of wine.

24:13.870 --> 24:15.246
- Mm.
- Then I want to hear more

24:15.246 --> 24:16.914
about that fling you had
with Tarzan.

24:16.998 --> 24:19.792
It was a crazy time, the '20s.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.294
Everyone went out with everyone.

24:21.294 --> 24:23.629
Carol went out with John,
who went out with Martha,

24:23.713 --> 24:26.215
who went out with Abigail. No one could keep track.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.967
That's for sure.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.386
Who did Delores marry
after you, Asher?

24:30.386 --> 24:32.597
- John Barrymore.
- I knew it was someone famous.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.640
- Really?
- I went to their wedding.

24:34.724 --> 24:37.059
- I outdrank John.
- What was that wedding like?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.769
Big. Expensive.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.897
And then they got divorced.
She married her obstetrician.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.481
Her obstetrician?

24:45.026 --> 24:47.111
- Our last bottle.
- Mmm.

24:47.195 --> 24:49.947
Then we break into
Rose's sherry stash.

24:50.031 --> 24:52.909
You know, I-I just might
change my train ticket

24:52.909 --> 24:55.036
and stay another day or two
if that's okay.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.913
- Fine by me.
- Oh, please do, Asher.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.373
I'd love to visit some
of my places in the Village,

24:59.457 --> 25:00.833
hit my old haunts.

25:00.917 --> 25:03.211
- It's been a long time.
- It's changed some.

25:05.296 --> 25:06.756
This is the place?

25:06.756 --> 25:08.716
- This is the place.
- Big.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.676
- Big and airy.
- It needs a spruce.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.595
But try to look beyond the dirt.

25:12.595 --> 25:16.224
It's got nice northern exposure,
a classic view.

25:16.224 --> 25:18.684
Nine subway lines
right below us,

25:18.768 --> 25:20.561
so the commute's easy
from anywhere.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.104
Good people on this floor, too.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.065
When they see something,
they don't talk.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.275
But what is this place?
What was it before?

25:26.359 --> 25:28.527
Well, we used it
as a kind of house

25:28.611 --> 25:31.072
that one could feel,
uh, safe in.

25:31.072 --> 25:33.991
- So it was a safe house?
- Something like that.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.369
There's a giant blood stain
on the floor.

25:36.369 --> 25:39.205
- Wasn't so safe for that guy.
- A nice rug will cover that up.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.415
We think this place
would be perfect for you.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.501
Guys, I can't afford this.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.920
Hey, we're aware
of your financial predicament.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.631
It's sitting here empty,
collecting dust. Use it.

25:48.631 --> 25:51.259
I wouldn't know what to do
with this much space.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.052
I mean, there's only one of me,
and I'm never home.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.888
What? You get another desk,
add a settee,

25:55.972 --> 25:58.933
throw a Murphy bed
in the back room, maybe a plant.

25:58.933 --> 26:00.559
You get a nice table out here,

26:00.643 --> 26:02.144
you put out some coffee,
some Danish.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.981
You get your name
etched on the door.

26:04.981 --> 26:06.190
My name?

26:06.274 --> 26:08.526
Susie Myerson and Associates.

26:08.526 --> 26:11.779
Susie Myerson
and Associates.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.281
It's the perfect
live-work combination.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.866
It's your chance to expand.
Start your business.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.785
Live here, work here.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.870
And start to make
some real money.

26:19.954 --> 26:22.540
And we can even delay charging
you rent or anything like that

26:22.540 --> 26:24.500
till you get settled
and got a cash flow.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.502
Just give us a little piece
of the action in return.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.087
Of Susie Myerson and Associates.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.714
Yeah, yeah.

26:29.714 --> 26:32.550
Does that sound okay?
You give us a taste?

26:32.550 --> 26:34.677
- Yeah, sure, whatever.
- Great.

26:34.677 --> 26:36.053
Everybody wins.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.973
Susie Myerson and Associates.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.226
<i>I got a shit ton of work
to do on it,</i>

26:42.310 --> 26:43.311
and I stopped counting the rats

26:43.311 --> 26:44.729
after it got
into the triple digits,

26:44.729 --> 26:47.273
but the elevator fucking works,
there is a bathroom,

26:47.273 --> 26:50.526
oh, and the view. Did I tell you
about the motherfucking view?

26:50.526 --> 26:52.486
Are these odds or evens?

26:52.570 --> 26:54.488
Oh, the view alone
says "big cheese."

26:54.572 --> 26:56.490
I'm only gonna take meetings
at night

26:56.574 --> 26:59.201
so that all potential clients
will walk in and see that view.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.162
- Did we pass it?
- And as they stand there

27:01.162 --> 27:03.414
and look at that view, I'll
walk up behind them and say...

27:03.414 --> 27:04.457
"You see that?

27:04.457 --> 27:06.375
Sign with me,
and it's all yours."

27:06.459 --> 27:07.835
I mean, I won't say it like that

27:07.835 --> 27:09.086
with an emphysemic pimp voice,

27:09.170 --> 27:11.505
- but just wait till you see it.
- Ah! Here it is.

27:11.589 --> 27:13.174
Fucking great view.

27:13.174 --> 27:14.759
Now, I have to install a phone

27:14.759 --> 27:16.594
and buy some office equipment.

27:16.594 --> 27:18.137
Gonna need a lot of pencils.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.430
Don't even know
what I'll use them for,

27:19.430 --> 27:21.265
but I'll have them,
and I'll keep them sharp.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.809
- Oh, table.
- Hey, maybe I should get some of those paper clips.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.812
File covers for files.
There's gonna be a lot of files.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.522
Hey, I should get
my own typewriter.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.441
Maybe two typewriters.
That crazy?

27:30.441 --> 27:33.235
You know what? I'll start
with one, see how it goes.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.696
I am gonna type the shit
out of that typewriter.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.948
Whiskey neat. Two.

27:38.032 --> 27:39.200
Hey, should I get a secretary?

27:39.200 --> 27:41.243
Harry has three secretaries.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.495
That's when you know
you made it,

27:42.495 --> 27:44.413
when there're three dumpy broads
sitting outside

27:44.497 --> 27:45.790
your office
that know all your shit.

27:45.790 --> 27:48.000
- Let's get a drink.
- Done.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.627
<i>♪ Stupid cupid,
stop picking on me</i> ♪

27:49.627 --> 27:51.712
I have to say, I'm...

27:51.796 --> 27:53.881
Okay, fuck it. I'm excited.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.384
There, I said it.
Eat me, I'm excited!

27:58.386 --> 28:00.137
Oh, it's our song.

28:05.226 --> 28:07.019
<i>♪ I'm nobody...</i>

28:07.103 --> 28:08.479
What is this?

28:08.479 --> 28:10.523
It's new.

28:10.523 --> 28:12.066
- Did you...
- What?

28:12.066 --> 28:13.859
Did you bring me
to a lesbian bar?

28:13.943 --> 28:15.528
Fun, huh?

28:15.528 --> 28:17.530
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck, what?

28:17.530 --> 28:20.032
I just said "eat me"
really loud.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.660
- Are you upset?
- Why would you do this?

28:22.660 --> 28:24.495
Well, I just thought I'd try.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.163
I mean, I-I...
It-it... I never know...

28:26.247 --> 28:27.957
You never talk about yourself.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.291
That's 'cause it's none
of your business.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.001
Yeah,
but we're together all the time,

28:31.085 --> 28:32.628
and I just thought I'd try...

28:32.628 --> 28:35.214
- I don't care.
- What?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.341
I just want you to know
I don't care.

28:37.425 --> 28:40.511
- You don't?
- No. I am totally comfortable

28:40.511 --> 28:43.556
with you being
whatever it is you want to be.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.933
Well, thank you very much
for your permission.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.018
- I didn't mean...
- May I go to the bathroom?

28:48.102 --> 28:50.396
Do I need a note from my mother
to get out of gym class?

28:50.396 --> 28:52.231
I just meant
you can tell me anything.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.774
Jesus Christ. Miriam.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.734
How did you even know
about this place?

28:55.818 --> 28:57.319
What, you hang out
on Christopher Street

28:57.403 --> 28:59.238
asking guys
with carnations in their lapels

28:59.238 --> 29:00.614
where to find a butch bar?

29:00.698 --> 29:03.033
No. I was...

29:03.117 --> 29:04.952
not that specific.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.203
What'd you think,
you'd bring me here,

29:06.287 --> 29:08.372
I'd look around and just...
dive in?

29:08.456 --> 29:09.748
I wanted to give you the option.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.208
I didn't have a plan.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.544
I just thought we'd hang out,
check out the scene.

29:13.544 --> 29:14.628
"The scene"?

29:14.712 --> 29:16.338
This is the Village.
I live here.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.090
You think I don't know
how to find a lesbian bar?

29:18.174 --> 29:20.176
There are three
within rock-throwing distance.

29:20.176 --> 29:21.760
Two doors down, there's guys

29:21.844 --> 29:23.804
sticking their fists
up each other's asses.

29:23.888 --> 29:25.931
This is my town.
I know everything.

29:26.015 --> 29:28.601
You are always alone. Always.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.060
So the fuck what?

29:30.144 --> 29:31.645
I don't want you to be alone.

29:31.729 --> 29:33.147
Let me worry about that.

29:33.147 --> 29:36.525
- I want you to be happy.
- Mm.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.569
Great. Pay for my drink.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.112
Susie.

29:40.196 --> 29:42.323
I am focused
on one thing right now.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.992
Susie Myerson and Associates.
That's it.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.702
Being your manager.
Not just your manager.

29:46.702 --> 29:50.414
Being a manager. The manager.
Do you understand?

29:50.498 --> 29:53.250
- Yeah, but...
- I got a fucking view!

29:53.334 --> 29:56.962
<i>♪ I'm nobody's sweet baby
no more</i> ♪

29:57.046 --> 29:58.464
Fuck.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.091
I can't give
your money back.

30:01.175 --> 30:03.302
- I spent it. And that's not magic.
- What can I get you?

30:03.302 --> 30:04.512
- It's commerce.
- No, I'm just here to...

30:04.512 --> 30:06.555
Hey!

30:06.639 --> 30:08.390
You're shooting fish
in a barrel!

30:08.474 --> 30:09.975
- Take it outside.
- Two out of three.

30:10.059 --> 30:12.686
Shut up. Welcome
to Susie Myerson and Associates.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.356
You'll love the view. Now move!

30:16.440 --> 30:18.067
Here you go, doll.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.490
Mitzi! You're up.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.575
Move your ass!

30:28.577 --> 30:29.828
- Hey!
- Yeah?

30:29.912 --> 30:30.996
You have to knock.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.248
- What?
- From now on.

30:32.248 --> 30:33.457
You can't just come in here,

30:33.541 --> 30:34.875
stick your face in,
stick anything in,

30:34.959 --> 30:36.210
before you knock.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.795
This dressing room
is for ladies only.

30:37.795 --> 30:40.089
You are a man. Right?

30:40.089 --> 30:43.217
- Yes. I'm a man.
- Men... knock.

30:43.217 --> 30:45.344
- But I run this place.
- You run the theater.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.680
We run the dressing room. Oh,
and people's asses are attached

30:47.680 --> 30:49.098
to the rest of their bodies.
so a simple,

30:49.098 --> 30:50.432
"Mitzi, you're up," will do.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.892
If she goes, her ass goes, too.

30:51.976 --> 30:53.811
- Got it? Great.
- Uh...

30:53.811 --> 30:55.604
Great, let's review. You, boy.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.189
Boys...

30:57.273 --> 30:59.358
- Knock.
- Trial run. Give it a shot.

31:01.569 --> 31:02.903
A little louder
if you want them to hear.

31:02.987 --> 31:04.154
But A for effort.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.823
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.449
- Okay?
- Okay!

31:07.533 --> 31:08.867
Did she just call us
fucking ladies?

31:08.951 --> 31:09.994
Great. Bye.

31:28.762 --> 31:30.556
Susie, you missed it.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.516
I banned Boise
from the dressing room.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.184
There's a knock policy now.

31:34.268 --> 31:36.395
Boys knock
because girls have knockers.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.439
I know. Save it for the stage,
but you know.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.399
- Payday. Payday.
- What?

31:40.399 --> 31:42.359
Ah, geez, the both of you.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.445
- The day you reach into your little cash box.
- Okay, okay.

31:44.445 --> 31:45.821
- And you hand me the money.
- I got it.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.239
- That you owe me.
- I'm doing it.

31:47.323 --> 31:48.866
- Top drawer. Right side.
- Mm-hmm.

31:48.866 --> 31:50.784
- I know where the box is.
- Under the keys.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.870
It's my drawer.
I know what's in my drawer.

31:54.872 --> 31:56.999
I bet you know what every one
of those is for, huh?

31:56.999 --> 31:59.335
You know, technically
I don't have to give you this

31:59.335 --> 32:01.211
until she's finished
her last set of the night,

32:01.295 --> 32:02.921
but I'm a prince, so...

32:03.005 --> 32:05.007
Well, pleasure doing business
with you, Your Highness.

32:06.467 --> 32:08.052
Will you just talk to me
for a minute?

32:08.052 --> 32:09.845
- I wanted to talk to you about...
- Here.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.181
Thank you. Susie, please.

32:12.181 --> 32:13.682
Susie, stop.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.392
Susie, just...

32:17.186 --> 32:19.688
Shit.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.774
You're up, Maisel. Get your...

32:21.774 --> 32:24.234
Get it...
that thing behind you...

32:24.318 --> 32:26.320
Get...

32:41.835 --> 32:43.629
Oy!

32:43.629 --> 32:45.130
Oh. You gonna talk?

32:45.214 --> 32:47.341
Yeah. I figured, what the fuck?

32:50.219 --> 32:53.055
Let's have another hand
for Mitzi.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.939
Hey guys, I'm curious.

33:01.939 --> 33:04.566
How many of your wives
know you're here tonight?

33:06.193 --> 33:08.028
Hmm?

33:08.112 --> 33:09.947
Little news for you.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.865
All of them.

33:11.949 --> 33:14.410
And how? Laundry.

33:14.410 --> 33:17.287
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Because laundry is the diary of your day.

33:17.371 --> 33:19.748
One sniff of your shirt,
they can smell Lucy,

33:19.832 --> 33:22.042
your "loose-y" secretary.

33:22.126 --> 33:23.752
They can smell the horse track.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.630
The cigars with the boys.
The cigars with Lucy.

33:26.714 --> 33:30.134
And they can definitely
smell this place.

33:30.134 --> 33:32.594
Plus they go through your pants
and wallets at night

33:32.678 --> 33:33.971
while you're asleep.

33:33.971 --> 33:35.973
They know everything.

33:35.973 --> 33:38.600
They just pretend they don't.
And why?

33:38.684 --> 33:42.062
Because they've got
their own secret lives.

33:42.146 --> 33:45.065
Oh, you don't think
your wife has a life

33:45.149 --> 33:46.775
you don't know about?

33:46.859 --> 33:49.903
Your wife is home alone
all day long.

33:49.987 --> 33:52.698
You know who else is
around your house all day long?

33:52.698 --> 33:55.117
Milkmen, mailmen...

33:55.117 --> 33:57.077
handymen...

33:57.161 --> 33:59.163
salesmen.

33:59.163 --> 34:01.623
Do you know how many products
there are to sell out there?

34:01.707 --> 34:03.250
Any of you come home one day,

34:03.250 --> 34:05.294
and there's
a brand new vacuum cleaner?

34:05.294 --> 34:06.754
I mean, you had a perfectly
good one when you left

34:06.754 --> 34:09.840
in the morning but then,
ding dong, "Hi, I'm handsome."

34:11.049 --> 34:13.010
"Want to reach
those hard-to-reach spots?

34:13.010 --> 34:14.720
"I've got
an expandable attachment

34:14.720 --> 34:16.430
that you're gonna love."

34:16.430 --> 34:18.682
Hey, you think
I pay you to stand there?

34:18.766 --> 34:20.309
Customers, drinks, go.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.394
And you want her
to have that secret life.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.271
Trust me. 'Cause if she didn't,

34:24.271 --> 34:26.231
with all that
she knows about yours,

34:26.315 --> 34:28.567
she'd spend those lonely nights
sitting there thinking,

34:28.567 --> 34:30.194
"How long would I have
to hold this pillow

34:30.194 --> 34:32.154
over his face
before his breathing stops?"

34:32.154 --> 34:34.156
I can answer that, ladies.

34:34.156 --> 34:36.408
Three minutes.
Two and a half if he smokes.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.871
Now hold on
to your Great Gatsbys, guys,

34:40.871 --> 34:42.498
'cause here comes our salute

34:42.498 --> 34:44.625
to the Roaring '20s!

34:49.379 --> 34:52.007
- Heads up.
- Huh?

34:52.007 --> 34:54.676
Motherfucker!

34:57.095 --> 35:00.057
Boy, you're almost as funny
as the men comics.

35:00.057 --> 35:02.434
We're gonna work on that.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.520
Oh, shit!

35:06.021 --> 35:08.190
We really appreciate you doing
this on our home turf,

35:08.190 --> 35:10.025
- Agent Webber.
- Yes, thank you.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.861
I live six blocks away,
so I get to walk home tonight.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.697
- Good deal.
- Excuse me, can I get anything else for anybody?

35:15.781 --> 35:17.366
Coffee? Tea?

35:17.366 --> 35:19.326
By the time you brew it, I'll
be gone, but thank you, ma'am.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.954
Yes, thanks, Rosie.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.914
Now, gentlemen,
let me remind you both

35:23.914 --> 35:25.249
that you're under oath.

35:25.249 --> 35:27.334
Yes, sir.

35:28.502 --> 35:31.046
That's Abe's way
of saying, "Got it."

35:31.046 --> 35:32.798
Then let's proceed.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.508
So, some years ago,
there was an incident.

35:34.508 --> 35:36.176
And it hit our files.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.095
Careful with that, it's a relic.

35:38.095 --> 35:40.764
And Mr. Weissman recently wrote

35:40.848 --> 35:42.724
about this incident
in <i>The Village Voice.</i>

35:42.808 --> 35:45.519
And it implicated the two
of you, but I am here today

35:45.519 --> 35:48.355
to see what we can do to close
this matter. Mr. Kessler?

35:48.355 --> 35:51.233
Thank you. For the record,
we've got two young men

35:51.233 --> 35:53.777
of a bygone era--
activists, patriots--

35:53.861 --> 35:57.197
who walk into a federal
building, admittedly uninvited,

35:57.281 --> 35:59.741
they cause a little mischief,
then leave

35:59.825 --> 36:01.743
without harming a fly.
Those are the facts.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.662
Now, hold on,
since we're under oath,

36:03.662 --> 36:06.039
no fly was harmed,
but a water bug...

36:06.123 --> 36:07.916
...got it pretty good.

36:11.211 --> 36:14.172
Ah, this all seems
very open and shut.

36:14.256 --> 36:15.841
No harm, no foul.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.801
I believe I already have
more than enough here

36:17.885 --> 36:20.846
- to report back to D.C. that...
- Asher walked into the building.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.931
I'm sorry, uh, what?

36:23.015 --> 36:24.975
Asher walked into the building.

36:24.975 --> 36:27.352
I didn't go inside the building.

36:27.436 --> 36:29.187
I stayed outside.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.023
We don't need to Martha Graham
this whole thing, right?

36:31.023 --> 36:33.150
With the precise choreography?

36:33.150 --> 36:35.027
I'm under oath,
so I'm being accurate.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.695
Asher walked into the building.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.239
Asher lit the fire,
Asher committed arson.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.325
- Look, gentlemen...
- Abe, what are you doing?

36:41.325 --> 36:43.410
I'm telling the FBI
what happened.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.412
You walked into the building...

36:45.412 --> 36:47.915
And you stood lookout, which
makes you just as culpable.

36:47.915 --> 36:49.833
I didn't know he was going in

36:49.917 --> 36:52.127
to commit an act of arson.
You should write that down.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.254
Well, why did you think
I was going in?

36:54.338 --> 36:56.214
To admire the portrait
of Warren G. Harding?

36:56.298 --> 36:58.592
Whoa, whoa!
Guys, guys, slow down!

36:58.592 --> 37:01.678
Old friends.
Old, cranky, loquacious friends.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.931
He also vandalized
the stock exchange in 1923.

37:03.931 --> 37:05.390
Is that in your files?

37:05.474 --> 37:06.975
Abe, what the fuck?!

37:07.059 --> 37:09.311
Just him, not me. You really
should write this down.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.355
- I'm gonna need a pen.
- You do not need a pen.

37:11.355 --> 37:13.482
In fact, Agent Webber,
can we speak in private?

37:13.482 --> 37:15.859
I have some background
information that may help here.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.402
Sure. Should I bring a pen?

37:17.486 --> 37:19.112
Do not bring a pen.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.455
- Why?
- Why?

37:28.455 --> 37:30.457
I heard yelling. What happened?

37:30.457 --> 37:32.542
How long did you two go out?

37:32.626 --> 37:33.835
What are you talking about?

37:33.919 --> 37:35.379
You and Rosie. How long?

37:35.379 --> 37:36.797
Oh, no.

37:36.797 --> 37:39.132
Do not tell me that
this is what it's about.

37:39.216 --> 37:40.884
I want to know how long
my alleged wife

37:40.968 --> 37:42.594
went out
with my alleged best friend.

37:42.678 --> 37:44.513
Abe, I told you
I went out with Asher.

37:44.513 --> 37:46.056
- You did not.
- I did!

37:46.056 --> 37:47.891
20 times, at least!

37:47.975 --> 37:50.686
Rose, I admit that sometimes
I don't listen to you,

37:50.686 --> 37:53.897
but this time,
I was listening to you

37:53.981 --> 37:56.900
when you did not tell me that
you schtupped my best friend.

37:56.984 --> 37:58.485
- Abe!
- I'm sorry.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.696
So you're selling me out
to the FBI

38:00.696 --> 38:03.198
because Rosie and I
went out a few times?

38:03.198 --> 38:05.701
A few times? The other day, it
was two months. How long was it?

38:05.701 --> 38:08.870
It was 35 years ago--
who cares?!

38:08.954 --> 38:11.206
And you, you with your,
"He was so good-looking

38:11.206 --> 38:12.499
when he was young."
Is there anything else

38:12.499 --> 38:13.875
you want to tell me about?

38:13.959 --> 38:15.961
Abe Weissman,
you're being irrational.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.879
What parts of this woman's
body did you touch?

38:17.963 --> 38:19.047
- Abe!
- What?

38:19.131 --> 38:21.133
What parts? Because
I want to mark them off,

38:21.133 --> 38:22.759
and I am never going
to touch those parts again.

38:22.843 --> 38:25.137
Are you hearing yourself?

38:25.137 --> 38:26.972
I have just the right chalk.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.724
Long lasting, doesn't erase.

38:28.724 --> 38:29.975
Abe...

38:29.975 --> 38:31.518
I've had enough of you two!

38:31.518 --> 38:33.770
Abe...

38:33.854 --> 38:36.189
You are out
of your fucking mind!

38:36.273 --> 38:38.734
- Abe!
- Did he just lock himself in his room?

38:38.734 --> 38:42.696
Abe, may I remind you
that you broke up with me.

38:42.696 --> 38:46.408
Rose, may I remind you
that I was working on my PhD,

38:46.408 --> 38:50.120
and I told you that when it was
complete, I might come back!

38:50.120 --> 38:53.623
I was very upfront
and sincere about that.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.459
Asher,
I'm very sorry about this.

38:55.459 --> 38:57.169
Abe is completely out of line.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.379
Oh, good,
he's back.

38:59.463 --> 39:01.798
I could have schtupped Delores.

39:01.882 --> 39:04.259
- What?
- Yeah, while you and Rose

39:04.259 --> 39:06.762
and her Louise Brooks
harlot hair were catting about,

39:06.762 --> 39:09.848
Delores made it very clear
that she wanted me badly.

39:09.848 --> 39:13.101
Delores wanted everybody, Abe!

39:13.185 --> 39:16.271
Eugene O'Neill, Aaron Copland,

39:16.271 --> 39:18.774
Tarzan, Josephine Baker.

39:18.774 --> 39:21.443
Sh-sh... My God...

39:21.443 --> 39:23.487
What?

39:23.487 --> 39:25.489
I just had an idea for a play.

39:25.489 --> 39:27.616
- What?
- It's the best idea

39:27.616 --> 39:28.950
for a play I've had in 20 years.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.911
I-I see it.

39:30.911 --> 39:33.121
I see the arc
of the whole thing.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.040
- I got to write this down.
- Asher,

39:35.040 --> 39:37.250
do not write a play about this!

39:37.334 --> 39:39.544
- I need a pen!
- Do not get a pen!

39:39.628 --> 39:42.047
Up yours, Abe!

39:42.047 --> 39:44.007
If you get a pen
and write a play,

39:44.091 --> 39:45.509
I'll destroy it in <i>The Voice.</i>

39:45.509 --> 39:47.052
I will! I'll do that!

39:47.052 --> 39:48.845
I have no doubt.

39:48.929 --> 39:50.639
Goodbye, Abe.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.766
Last word of advice,
writer to writer.

39:52.766 --> 39:55.811
You over-use "quite,"
and "thusly" is a stupid word.

39:55.811 --> 39:57.646
Fuck you, don't call me again.

39:57.646 --> 40:00.023
And please throw out
that weird chalk of yours.

40:00.107 --> 40:02.651
Rosie.

40:02.651 --> 40:04.986
Goodbye.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.197
Your Louise Brooks
was a knockout.

40:07.197 --> 40:09.783
Don't you tell Rosie that
her fad hairdo was a knockout!

40:09.783 --> 40:11.868
Asher. Asher!

40:19.793 --> 40:22.295
This is why I need a study.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.966
'Cause... I have no place to go.

40:27.467 --> 40:31.138
<i>Well, if I don't love you ♪</i>

40:31.138 --> 40:33.181
<i>Baby ♪</i>

40:33.265 --> 40:35.392

40:35.392 --> 40:37.102

40:37.102 --> 40:40.397

40:40.397 --> 40:42.399
Out, out!

40:42.399 --> 40:44.401
Don’t come back soon!

40:44.401 --> 40:47.070
Hey, guy at table six wants
a ring in a glass.

40:47.154 --> 40:49.489
- Great.
- But he gave me two, and he wants us to pick.

40:49.573 --> 40:51.283
That's ridiculous.
I mean, how are we supposed

40:51.283 --> 40:53.160
to pick another man's... Ooh!

40:53.160 --> 40:55.495
- I like that one.
- Yeah, that was my first choice, too.

40:55.579 --> 40:57.372
But will it make
her finger look too fat?

40:57.372 --> 40:59.583
Yeah, the pear-shape tends
to elongate.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.793
But boy does this one sparkle.

41:01.877 --> 41:03.545
Your new guy doesn't know me!

41:03.545 --> 41:05.839
Let her in, Hal.
Either one's fine.

41:05.839 --> 41:08.091
This is too much pressure.
Hey, Midge!

41:08.175 --> 41:09.759
- Hey, Arch.
- You want a drink?

41:09.843 --> 41:12.137
- I do.
- Martini up with olives?

41:12.137 --> 41:14.139
- I'm so predictable.
- If only.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.849
Hey, how long are those guys on?

41:15.849 --> 41:17.976
I need ten minutes
to try out some stuff.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.020
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm working on a new bit for the strip club

41:20.020 --> 41:21.688
that I'm not quite sure about,
and I'd rather bomb here

41:21.688 --> 41:23.398
- than at the real place.
- Thank you.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.817
- You're welcome.
- Wait.

41:25.901 --> 41:27.819
- Did you say strip club?
- Yes.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.529
You're working at a strip club?

41:29.613 --> 41:31.948
- Yes. You didn't know?
- No.

41:32.032 --> 41:34.075
- Didn't Ethan tell you?
- Why would he tell me?

41:34.159 --> 41:35.994
- I told him to tell you.
- You told our five-year-old son

41:35.994 --> 41:37.579
to tell me you're working
at a strip club?

41:37.579 --> 41:39.581
- Did he forget?
- Yes, he forgot.

41:39.581 --> 41:42.083
Thank God, he forgot.
I don't want our son thinking

41:42.167 --> 41:43.460
about his mother
at a strip club.

41:43.460 --> 41:44.920
It's not like I did
a number for him.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.755
- Strip club.
- I'm the emcee.

41:46.755 --> 41:48.006
But what about your career?

41:48.006 --> 41:49.174
What do you mean,
what about my career?

41:49.174 --> 41:51.968
- This is part of my career.
- Okay.

41:52.052 --> 41:53.678
- What?
- I'm not gonna say anything.

41:53.762 --> 41:55.305
Then don't say you're not
gonna say anything,

41:55.305 --> 41:56.848
'cause that's saying a thing.

41:56.932 --> 41:59.601
Working in a strip club
just seems like a step back.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.686
Many famous people got
their start in strip clubs.

42:01.770 --> 42:03.355
Lenny worked at strip clubs.

42:03.355 --> 42:05.190
You took me to see him
at a strip club.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.150
You were opening for Shy Baldwin
a few months ago.

42:07.234 --> 42:09.319
- So?
- So how is anyone gonna

42:09.319 --> 42:11.029
take you seriously
in a jiggle joint?

42:11.029 --> 42:12.447
Have you been talking to Susie?

42:12.447 --> 42:14.032
No, I have not been
talking to Susie, why?

42:14.032 --> 42:16.534
Because you're saying exactly
the same things Susie says.

42:16.618 --> 42:18.161
Well, maybe Susie's
right about this.

42:18.245 --> 42:19.829
Maybe you should hire her
as your manager.

42:19.913 --> 42:21.623
Oh, wait a minute.

42:22.916 --> 42:24.542
Mei.

42:24.626 --> 42:25.794
Hi.

42:25.794 --> 42:27.671
What's up, Doc?

42:27.671 --> 42:29.381
I'm sorry, am I, uh...

42:29.381 --> 42:31.508
I'm just trying
to wrangle some stage time.

42:31.508 --> 42:33.385
- Oh.
- I swear.

42:33.385 --> 42:35.303
Okay. I didn't know if this was

42:35.387 --> 42:37.055
Joel's mother trying to get
you two back together again.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.515
No! Absolutely not!

42:38.515 --> 42:40.642
- Wow. Lightning fast.
- I just meant...

42:40.642 --> 42:42.644
Well, I'm gonna be
in your office, so, uh...

42:44.521 --> 42:46.815
That's all, folks.

42:51.945 --> 42:53.780
What was that about?

42:53.780 --> 42:55.907
What? You started
the Looney Tunes thing.

42:55.991 --> 42:57.951
I'm talking
about the Shirley comment.

42:57.951 --> 43:00.620
- You want your ten minutes?
- Yep.

43:00.704 --> 43:03.206
Just don't stink so much
that you clear the place out.

43:03.290 --> 43:05.292
I make no guarantees.

43:07.627 --> 43:09.212
She said yes!

43:09.296 --> 43:11.548
Congratulations, Arch.

43:15.051 --> 43:17.929
How long have I been here?

43:18.013 --> 43:19.931
- Three days.
- I should go.

43:20.015 --> 43:21.975
- Okay.
- I can't move.

43:21.975 --> 43:23.685
Throw up, dry out, and sleep.

43:23.685 --> 43:25.603
We start tomorrow.

43:35.572 --> 43:38.116
Replace glass.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.035
Replace board.

43:40.035 --> 43:42.120
Replace pipe.

43:44.039 --> 43:46.041
Replace faucet.

43:48.585 --> 43:50.587
Replace toilet seat.

43:56.551 --> 43:58.636
Aw, Jesus.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.306
Replace toilet.

44:11.733 --> 44:13.735
She knows me.

44:22.619 --> 44:24.579
Shit!

44:26.790 --> 44:28.833
Shit.

44:28.917 --> 44:30.502
Hello to you, too.

44:30.502 --> 44:31.795
I'm busy, Sophie.

44:33.213 --> 44:34.547
You found an office.

44:34.631 --> 44:37.092
I tried to close the door.

44:37.092 --> 44:38.301
Yeah, it's being fixed.

44:38.385 --> 44:39.928
I'm just commenting on the fact

44:39.928 --> 44:42.722
that I tried and failed.

44:42.806 --> 44:44.808
Because it's very broken.

44:44.808 --> 44:46.726
And unattractive.

44:46.810 --> 44:48.770
You should also get a new desk.

44:48.770 --> 44:50.313
What do you want?

44:50.397 --> 44:51.731
You don't have a chair.

44:51.815 --> 44:54.776
I can't sit
if you don't have a chair.

44:54.776 --> 44:56.861
You don't seem to care.

45:02.367 --> 45:05.161
I'll hold it so it won't fall
on you on the way out.

45:06.329 --> 45:08.248
For the first time in 30 years,

45:08.248 --> 45:10.583
I can't get any work.

45:10.667 --> 45:13.002
No venue in this country
will book me anymore.

45:13.086 --> 45:14.504
Not even Phoenix.

45:14.504 --> 45:18.633
Not that I can stomach
going back on the road again.

45:18.633 --> 45:21.970
I'm financially overextended, meaning

45:21.970 --> 45:24.597
I have more expenses
than money to cover them.

45:24.681 --> 45:26.474
- Yeah, I know what overextended means.
- Well, you're

45:26.558 --> 45:28.476
so quiet over there,
so I wasn't sure.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.770
My business manager said

45:30.854 --> 45:32.814
my lifestyle needs to change.

45:32.814 --> 45:34.983
And then he quit.

45:34.983 --> 45:36.985
So that's a change.

45:36.985 --> 45:39.988
My dogs
won't eat canned food.

45:39.988 --> 45:41.823
Even though it's not that bad.

45:41.823 --> 45:43.241
What do you want, Lucille?

45:44.325 --> 45:45.827
Don't you want
to know how I know

45:45.827 --> 45:48.621
- the dog food's not that bad?
- Nope.

45:48.705 --> 45:51.541
There's a brand-new
NBC game show.

45:51.541 --> 45:54.752
They're looking for a host,
and I want it.

45:54.836 --> 45:57.297
It's perfect for me.
I'd be great at it.

45:57.297 --> 45:59.799
But the network
won't even meet with me.

45:59.883 --> 46:01.551
I'd audition, I'd test.

46:01.551 --> 46:04.220
Whatever they want.
But they won't even consider it.

46:04.304 --> 46:06.264
I called Harry a hundred times.

46:06.264 --> 46:08.266
He won't take my calls.

46:08.266 --> 46:10.018
I even went to his office once.

46:10.018 --> 46:12.479
They said he was golfing.
It was raining out.

46:12.479 --> 46:15.523
Plus he walked right by me,
so I know they were lying.

46:15.607 --> 46:18.234
That's terrible. Kind of like
you've been blackballed.

46:18.318 --> 46:19.861
Yes.

46:19.861 --> 46:21.070
It doesn't feel good, does it?

46:21.154 --> 46:22.530
No.

46:22.614 --> 46:24.157
Doesn't feel good at all.

46:24.157 --> 46:27.327
Well, I'm sorry, Soph,
our paths have diverged.

46:27.327 --> 46:28.828
That means your path went one
way and my path went another.

46:28.912 --> 46:31.414
I know what diverged means.

46:31.498 --> 46:34.250
Okay, well, seeing
as how our paths have diverged,

46:34.334 --> 46:37.504
I think it's best that we--
you and me--

46:37.504 --> 46:39.923
we stay, you know... diverged.

46:39.923 --> 46:41.508
You didn't finish
very strong there.

46:41.508 --> 46:43.801
Fuck you. Let me fix my desk.

46:43.885 --> 46:45.845
What if I were to apologize?

46:45.929 --> 46:48.014
I got enough to clean up here
without your head exploding.

46:48.014 --> 46:50.183
You put my show on Broadway.

46:50.183 --> 46:53.102
You did that.
No one else even tried.

46:53.186 --> 46:55.271
Look, Sophie,
I am sorry about the game show.

46:55.355 --> 46:57.357
I just don't know
what I could do.

46:58.983 --> 47:01.653
Well, if you happen
to think of anything...

47:03.112 --> 47:05.240
...I'd be very grateful.

47:08.868 --> 47:11.204
You got Dawes driving you home?

47:11.204 --> 47:13.289
Dawes left.

47:14.791 --> 47:16.793
Shit.

47:25.969 --> 47:27.095
Hey.

47:28.972 --> 47:30.598
If I do this-- help you--

47:30.682 --> 47:32.392
you got to fucking agree
to lose my number.

47:32.392 --> 47:35.061
I promise.

47:35.061 --> 47:37.397
Oh, will you look at that.

47:43.069 --> 47:45.029
You got...

47:48.741 --> 47:51.578
Wonderful.

47:51.578 --> 47:53.538
Wonderful!

47:53.538 --> 47:55.623
What the fuck is wrong with me?
