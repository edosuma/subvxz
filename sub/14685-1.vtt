02:20.492 --> 02:23.796
- One orange.
- One orange.

02:23.928 --> 02:27.189
<i>- Chungwa moja.
- Chungwa moja.</i>

02:27.320 --> 02:30.494
- Two oranges.
- Two oranges.

02:30.625 --> 02:34.408
<i>- Machungwa mawili.
- Machungwa mawili.</i>

02:34.495 --> 02:38.236
- One pineapple.
- One pineapple.

04:12.216 --> 04:14.217
Omouri! Omouri!

05:22.322 --> 05:25.192
Here he is,
the cleverest boy in the world.

05:27.931 --> 05:29.889
- Hi, Mom.
- What's this?

05:30.019 --> 05:32.498
- It's a picture.
- Oh, my goodness.

05:32.585 --> 05:35.456
- And there's the Comoros.
- Of course it is.

05:35.542 --> 05:38.761
- Mrs Odone, may I have a word?
- Very skillful, sweetheart.

05:38.848 --> 05:41.718
- And Jupiter.
- Jupiter next to the Comoros?

05:41.805 --> 05:45.067
- I'll be right there, Lorenzo.
- OK, Mommy.

05:45.154 --> 05:49.068
- Is Lorenzo having problems at home?
- Not that I know of. Why?

05:49.242 --> 05:54.157
Today he started throwing paints around.
He went wild, destroying other paintings.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.548
- He must have been provoked.
- No, it came out of the blue.

05:57.635 --> 06:00.115
He's normally such a terrific kid.

06:04.681 --> 06:07.421
- Darling, were they teasing you?
- No.

06:07.551 --> 06:10.160
- Were they touching your paints?
- No.

06:10.290 --> 06:12.770
- How were they annoying you?
- They just were.

06:12.857 --> 06:14.640
- Doing what?
- Things.

06:14.727 --> 06:18.945
- What kind of things?
- Things that make me feel annoyed.

06:25.774 --> 06:27.208
- Mrs Odone...
- Another incident?

06:27.295 --> 06:30.296
Yes, and today it was much worse.

06:30.383 --> 06:33.862
Mrs Odone, is there
some trouble at home?

06:33.992 --> 06:36.037
Why do you assume
the trouble's at home?

06:36.167 --> 06:41.821
Because there's nothing here that
explains his behavior. It's... disturbed.

07:08.524 --> 07:10.828
He does present as a hyperactive.

07:10.959 --> 07:15.308
- But don't they repeat tasks endlessly?
- They perseverate, yes.

07:15.438 --> 07:19.352
Lorenzo's activities all have a structure:
beginning, middle and end.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.571
My gosh, he's learned three languages.
How could he be hyperactive?

07:24.615 --> 07:28.355
I know it's hard to accept that
a gifted child may also be disturbed.

07:28.441 --> 07:31.573
Lorenzo needs to be
referred to an IDP committee.

07:31.703 --> 07:33.574
- What's that?
- For what?

07:33.660 --> 07:36.444
Individual Disability Placement.

07:36.575 --> 07:40.053
Lorenzo needs to be
in a special ed class.

07:40.141 --> 07:44.055
Any special ed our son needs
will be provided at home.

07:44.228 --> 07:48.056
Anyhow, it was snowing and he began
to rub my hands to warm them.

07:48.230 --> 07:48.795
Uh-oh.

07:48.925 --> 07:51.839
No, he then produced photos
of his wife and children.

07:51.969 --> 07:54.840
- That old routine!
- Oh, Deirdre!

07:54.970 --> 07:57.797
Had I known this was the man
I would wait ten years for,

07:57.928 --> 08:00.581
- I'd have let you pick up the check.
- I did.

08:00.711 --> 08:02.755
Excuse me! You did not!

08:20.847 --> 08:24.934
Lorenzo's fallen off his bike
and he is really bleeding.

08:25.022 --> 08:27.849
Sh. That's a boy.

08:27.935 --> 08:30.545
Oh, such a brave boy.

08:30.632 --> 08:32.674
Doing just fine, here.

08:32.807 --> 08:35.460
You're going to be OK.

08:35.590 --> 08:37.547
It's Christmas Day, you know.

08:37.677 --> 08:42.027
All across the country
little boys are trying out their new bikes.

08:43.722 --> 08:47.636
Hey, champ. I think you'd better
tell your folks to lighten up.

08:47.767 --> 08:50.898
What are they gonna do when
you're playing for the Redskins?

09:33.344 --> 09:38.910
The EEG is normal, the skull X-ray
is normal and the CT scan is normal.

09:39.085 --> 09:42.607
I don't know what to tell you.
This boy is neurologically intact.

09:42.738 --> 09:45.738
Doctor, we spent
three years in East Africa.

09:45.870 --> 09:48.435
- In the Comoros.
- We were wondering...

09:48.566 --> 09:51.958
Well, if he might have
picked up some rare parasite.

09:52.828 --> 09:54.785
It's possible.

10:03.961 --> 10:06.048
Lorenzo, what are you doing?

10:07.701 --> 10:09.744
Lorenzo!

10:16.920 --> 10:20.878
Sweetie? Can you hear Mommy?

10:21.009 --> 10:24.619
This may be an auditory
processing difficulty.

10:24.749 --> 10:29.880
The ears hear all right,
but the brain has trouble listening.

10:30.012 --> 10:34.055
So, this means something
<i>is</i> affecting his brain.

10:34.187 --> 10:37.753
But what? A tumor? Multiple sclerosis?

10:37.883 --> 10:39.971
It could be any one of a dozen things.

10:50.669 --> 10:55.409
Listen, my friend. I'd like you to come
and stay in the hospital for three days.

10:55.496 --> 10:57.454
Your mom and dad can come too.

10:57.540 --> 11:00.628
We're gonna run some tests
and get to the bottom of this.

11:07.195 --> 11:09.282
Can you hear the sound?

11:09.717 --> 11:13.675
Keep your eyes right on that spot
for me. That helps me out.

11:15.023 --> 11:16.937
All right. Now close your eyes.

11:30.592 --> 11:34.115
Keep your eyes closed, buddy.
Stay nice and still.

13:20.969 --> 13:25.535
Of course, Easter festivals
existed long before baby Jesus.

13:25.623 --> 13:28.798
In pagan times, they marked
the beginning of spring.

13:28.884 --> 13:34.059
The egg tells us that the earth is going
to be reborn, just like a little baby chick.

13:34.190 --> 13:36.974
- I get it.
- Mrs Odone. Mr Odone.

13:37.408 --> 13:39.539
Dr Judalon is ready now.

13:39.670 --> 13:43.410
Hey, Lorenzo, would you like
to go feed the goldfish?

13:44.062 --> 13:46.193
It's all right, sweetheart. Go ahead.

13:46.280 --> 13:50.324
We'll be right back
in just a few minutes. Go ahead.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.499
This way, please.

13:58.718 --> 14:00.762
Please, have a seat.

14:14.114 --> 14:17.418
Well, we certainly don't need
that noise, do we?

14:25.812 --> 14:26.769
So...

14:27.204 --> 14:30.726
Please, Doctor, without equivocation.

14:33.988 --> 14:37.511
There is a family of diseases.
It's quite rare.

14:37.598 --> 14:39.990
The leukodystrophies.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.425
Lorenzo has one of them.
It's called ALD.

14:45.165 --> 14:50.297
ALD is an inborn error of metabolism
that causes a degeneration of the brain.

14:51.601 --> 14:56.255
It only affects males, usually
between the ages of five and ten.

14:57.125 --> 15:01.256
Its progress is relentless.
The end is inevitable.

15:02.474 --> 15:06.997
All boys with ALD die, usually
within two years of diagnosis.

15:16.825 --> 15:19.087
And there are no exceptions?

15:20.217 --> 15:22.305
I am so sorry.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.959
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes.

15:29.133 --> 15:31.438
Lorenzo shows the definitive sign:

15:31.568 --> 15:37.787
An abnormally high level of fat in his
blood, certain long-chain saturated fats.

15:40.658 --> 15:42.484
Oh.

15:43.919 --> 15:45.746
Uh...

15:46.442 --> 15:49.965
These fats... destroy his brain?

15:52.269 --> 15:54.314
But how?

15:55.270 --> 15:58.315
There is an enzyme
that should metabolize these fats,

15:58.401 --> 16:00.663
but in ALD boys it's defective.

16:00.793 --> 16:06.708
So they collect in the nerve cells,
a little bit like a cluster on the arteries.

16:06.839 --> 16:10.796
And... in some way

16:11.796 --> 16:14.841
this liquefies
the white matter of the brain.

16:15.015 --> 16:18.625
"Some way liquefies"?
Could you be more specific?

16:18.798 --> 16:23.147
Well, to be honest, we're not
quite certain just how it works.

16:24.321 --> 16:26.801
- You know what myelin is?
- No.

16:27.757 --> 16:31.758
Myelin is the fatty... sheath
that insulates the nerves.

16:31.889 --> 16:35.281
It's a little bit like plastic
around electrical wires.

16:35.368 --> 16:38.977
Without it, the nerves
cannot conduct an impulse.

16:39.064 --> 16:44.240
What ALD does is strip away the myelin.
It corrodes it, if you like.

16:44.370 --> 16:49.110
This causes degeneration of the brain
and the body loses its functions.

16:55.199 --> 16:59.113
But surely someone, somewhere,
must be working on this, no?

16:59.244 --> 17:01.505
- We would go anywhere.
- Yes.

17:02.244 --> 17:05.115
Ten years ago the disease
hadn't even been identified.

17:05.244 --> 17:08.855
We're still trying to
understand just what it is.

17:15.030 --> 17:18.684
I would like to
offer you some hope, but...

17:21.205 --> 17:24.381
Then there's absolutely no treatment?

17:27.946 --> 17:30.861
Normally at this point
we try to be constructive.

17:31.035 --> 17:34.122
We try to focus on what can be done.

17:34.252 --> 17:36.297
But in this case...

18:37.182 --> 18:40.271
When we get home, can we read a story?

18:40.401 --> 18:42.445
Of course, my darling.

18:47.445 --> 18:50.142
Lorenzino, let's go home.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.749
<i>Mr Odone?
I have a Dr Judalon on line three.</i>

21:26.923 --> 21:30.315
<i>- Good. Put him through.
- They're waiting for you in the meeting.</i>

21:30.445 --> 21:32.272
<i>All right, thank you.</i>

21:32.402 --> 21:33.707
<i>- Hello?
- Augusto?</i>

21:33.838 --> 21:36.360
<i>I just got off the phone to Gus Nikolais,</i>

21:36.491 --> 21:39.926
<i>a professor of neurology at
the Institute of Childhood Diseases.</i>

21:40.057 --> 21:46.493
<i>If there is a so-called "world expert"
on the leukodystrophies, Nikolais is it.</i>

21:46.580 --> 21:48.972
- Ah, good.
<i>- I don't want to raise false hopes,</i>

21:49.102 --> 21:53.842
<i>but he's working on
an experimental protocol based on a diet.</i>

21:53.930 --> 21:55.452
Wonderful.

22:08.933 --> 22:10.934
Peanut butter, red meat, cheese...

22:11.065 --> 22:14.761
Unpeeled fruit, spinach, olive oil...
But these are healthy foods.

22:14.935 --> 22:19.066
Yes, but they contain
very long-chain saturated fats.

22:19.893 --> 22:21.198
I...

22:21.372 --> 22:26.156
I still do not understand why
they are so harmful to Lorenzo.

22:26.242 --> 22:30.157
- Why are they so destructive?
- How can spinach make the difference?

22:30.243 --> 22:34.897
The human body needs these fats
in order to create cells,

22:34.983 --> 22:38.855
and the excess is burned off.
That's normally, of course.

22:38.942 --> 22:43.073
But in the case of an ALD boy,
these saturates can't be broken down

22:43.203 --> 22:45.248
and they build up in the brain.

22:45.378 --> 22:50.858
And somehow this buildup
strips the myelin covering.

22:50.988 --> 22:54.119
Yes, exactly. And, for the moment,
we don't know why this is.

22:54.250 --> 22:58.382
But we feel that, by withdrawing
the saturated fats from the diet,

22:58.512 --> 23:01.034
we will prevent them
accumulating in the brain.

23:01.121 --> 23:02.643
And if we could?

23:02.774 --> 23:05.731
There's no way to reverse
neurological damage.

23:05.861 --> 23:09.950
All we can hope for is
to slow the cascade of symptoms.

23:10.080 --> 23:13.342
But if it's any consolation to you,
you'll be helping us

23:13.429 --> 23:17.777
understand the biochemistry
of this heartless disease.

23:19.996 --> 23:23.605
So, can we enroll Lorenzo in our trial?

23:26.954 --> 23:28.998
I suppose so.

23:30.085 --> 23:34.913
Good. Then I will pass you
over to our dietitian

23:35.043 --> 23:39.827
and meanwhile we should arrange
some genetic counseling.

23:39.958 --> 23:43.741
Oh, Dr Nikolais, it's highly unlikely
that we will have another child.

23:43.828 --> 23:47.176
No, but your sisters and their daughters
may all be carriers.

23:47.307 --> 23:50.743
- We need to test them.
- Only my family? What about his?

23:50.917 --> 23:55.352
No, no. ALD is passed
only through the mother.

23:56.527 --> 23:58.571
But I thought you understood all this.

24:01.093 --> 24:04.877
We knew it was inborn, but

24:05.573 --> 24:09.052
we assumed that meant
a combination of our genes.

24:09.183 --> 24:11.661
That's true in other inherited diseases,

24:11.792 --> 24:14.314
but ALD is only carried
on the female chromosome.

24:14.444 --> 24:16.532
Excuse me.

24:17.794 --> 24:21.011
Are you saying that Lorenzo
got this directly from me?

24:22.186 --> 24:26.665
Well, in the sense that
ALD is sex-linked, yes.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.144
It goes from mother to son.

24:31.711 --> 24:36.233
- And how did I get it?
- The woman gets it from her mother.

24:36.363 --> 24:39.712
And if I inherited the defect,
why don't I have the disease?

24:39.843 --> 24:43.322
No, the woman is only
the carrier, nothing else.

24:43.844 --> 24:49.193
But with each conception, she has
a 50-50 chance of passing on the defect.

24:49.367 --> 24:52.063
And when that happens...

24:52.194 --> 24:55.455
It's the cruelest kind of genetic lottery.

24:56.282 --> 24:58.152
- Lottery?
- Yes, a clumsy word.

24:58.282 --> 25:02.414
I use it because it's...
so arbitrary, you know.

25:02.545 --> 25:04.806
- No one is to blame.
- Um...

25:05.720 --> 25:08.763
If Michaela's mother had this,

25:08.894 --> 25:11.329
and her mother's mother,

25:13.373 --> 25:15.461
why was there no warning?

25:15.983 --> 25:19.419
Well, I suppose if you went back
into the family tree, you'd...

25:19.505 --> 25:24.898
But remember, a short time ago
this disease didn't even have a name.

25:26.290 --> 25:30.465
Mrs Odone, you have enough
to put up with without...

25:30.596 --> 25:33.074
You have nothing to blame yourself for.

25:37.032 --> 25:39.076
Thank you.

25:47.470 --> 25:49.035
<i>It's not a good idea.</i>

25:49.121 --> 25:54.079
All right, so she doesn't want me. What
about Mother? She's packed and ready.

25:54.254 --> 25:57.429
<i>Kenise, Michaela doesn't
want anybody around.</i>

25:57.603 --> 25:59.863
What about Father Killian? He can come.

25:59.995 --> 26:02.343
Hell, no. She's not even
going to Mass now.

26:02.473 --> 26:05.474
<i>- Deirdre, what is happening there?</i>
- Just let it rest, OK?

26:05.604 --> 26:07.996
<i>No. What will they do
for Lorenzo's birthday?</i>

26:08.083 --> 26:10.475
- I'll call you. Bye.
<i>- No. Deirdre!</i>

26:11.519 --> 26:15.303
This is wrong. More than ever
she needs her family here.

26:15.389 --> 26:18.086
She doesn't want nobody.
She's too angry.

26:18.173 --> 26:20.347
We cannot afford the time to be angry.

26:20.434 --> 26:22.653
Come on, look what she's dealing with.

26:22.783 --> 26:24.827
She does not have to deal with it alone.

26:24.957 --> 26:30.132
She feels incredibly alone and unlucky,
like she's been singled out by God.

26:30.264 --> 26:33.351
- Oh, Deirdre!
- Yes! Kenise is a carrier with two girls.

26:33.481 --> 26:37.917
Me, a carrier with no kids at all, and
Mariah has a boy but she's not a carrier.

26:38.005 --> 26:40.179
So only Michaela gets this laid on her.

26:40.265 --> 26:45.572
- This did not happen only to Michaela.
- Sure. You got two kids already, Odone.

26:45.658 --> 26:47.876
Mommy will make you something better:

26:48.007 --> 26:51.530
A big-boy fruit treat
with five different colors.

26:59.880 --> 27:04.838
She waited all this time to have one
child. She's not gonna have another.

27:26.973 --> 27:30.062
Francesco! Cristina!

27:32.889 --> 27:35.149
<i>- Ah, buongiorno.</i>
- Oh, Francesco!

28:01.417 --> 28:02.591
- Cristina.
- Michaela.

28:04.853 --> 28:05.940
<i>Ciao.</i>

28:16.290 --> 28:22.292
Everyone, this is Lorenzo's sister
and brother, all the way from Rome.

29:04.434 --> 29:06.478
This does not make sense.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.523
Lorenzo's saturated fats have risen.

29:10.697 --> 29:15.872
We eliminate them from his diet,
and in his blood they increase.

29:17.002 --> 29:21.351
If these very long-chain saturated fats
are destroying his mind,

29:21.482 --> 29:24.048
then surely we should
take him off the diet.

29:24.134 --> 29:26.483
<i>Mr Odone, please be patient.</i>

29:26.614 --> 29:31.398
<i>Your son has been on the diet only six
weeks. Wait until the end of the trial.</i>

29:31.572 --> 29:36.399
Dr Nikolais, what about the other boys?
What results are you seeing in them?

29:36.486 --> 29:39.356
<i>As with Lorenzo, it's too early to tell.</i>

29:39.530 --> 29:43.140
<i>We need the study to run
for the full six months.</i>

29:43.270 --> 29:45.706
That will tell you what
is obvious right now,

29:45.836 --> 29:50.490
that avoiding apple skins and pizza
has no effect on this brutal disease.

29:50.620 --> 29:57.057
Now, please, Doctor, is there anyone out
there who is chasing a definitive therapy?

29:57.839 --> 30:01.927
<i>You judge us too hastily. The French
have tried bone-marrow transplants,</i>

30:02.058 --> 30:05.667
<i>and in Boston we're about
to try immunosuppression.</i>

30:05.842 --> 30:09.842
- Why haven't we heard of these before?
<i>- The transplants were disastrous</i>

30:09.973 --> 30:12.974
<i>and the immunosuppression
is highly experimental.</i>

30:13.148 --> 30:15.626
<i>The protocol has been limited
to six boys,</i>

30:15.757 --> 30:19.192
<i>all more profoundly
afflicted than your son.</i>

30:19.280 --> 30:22.976
For God's sake! How afflicted
does he need to be?

30:23.107 --> 30:26.282
It's a school, Lorenzo,
like any other school.

30:26.368 --> 30:31.543
- And it's full of doctors?
- Yes. Some of the cleverest in America.

30:32.022 --> 30:34.370
- What color is that cross?
- Red.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.501
That's right. It's red.

30:38.850 --> 30:43.199
I'll speak to your parents for a second.
Leah's gonna take your blood pressure.

30:43.373 --> 30:45.417
I'll be right back.

30:45.504 --> 30:48.201
I'll just put this around your arm.

30:49.331 --> 30:52.201
You've had this done before, haven't you?

30:53.854 --> 30:57.811
Look, it's important you both
know exactly what's going on.

30:57.985 --> 31:01.073
Cyclophosphides are no picnic.
This is chemotherapy.

31:01.160 --> 31:05.378
We're gonna be suppressing
his immune system. It's very high-risk.

31:05.510 --> 31:09.118
We'll need to keep him here
at least three weeks.

31:09.293 --> 31:12.859
Now, Lorenzo is still walking,
talking and communicating.

31:12.989 --> 31:15.251
But that could all change.

31:15.381 --> 31:19.513
Now, knowing all this, do you
still want us to go ahead with it?

31:21.775 --> 31:24.035
Given the alternatives, yes.

31:35.909 --> 31:39.779
The faculty is very grateful
to Lorenzo for doing this.

31:52.347 --> 31:57.131
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Lorenzo
Odone, whom I've spoken to you about.

31:57.262 --> 32:00.350
Now, young Mr Odone,
you need to come with me.

32:03.351 --> 32:05.394
You are getting so big!

32:07.438 --> 32:11.222
Now, I'm gonna put you up here
so we can all see you, OK?

32:11.309 --> 32:12.831
Attaboy.

32:14.788 --> 32:17.485
Ten weeks after diagnosis
we observe hemianopia

32:17.571 --> 32:19.833
with transient horizontal nystagmus.

32:19.963 --> 32:22.529
The pupillary light reflexes
are still intact,

32:22.616 --> 32:24.617
and, as yet, there's no optic atrophy.

32:24.703 --> 32:28.313
However, there is evidence of
early occipital-lobe involvement.

32:28.444 --> 32:33.011
Why are all these people here?

32:33.097 --> 32:39.012
- I beg your pardon, Lorenzo?
- Why are all these people here?

32:39.099 --> 32:41.795
He asks why all these people are here.

32:43.013 --> 32:46.275
Well, they're all doctors

32:46.405 --> 32:49.493
and they want to learn
how to help other boys in the future.

32:49.580 --> 32:52.145
Other boys with the boo-boo?

32:52.494 --> 32:55.886
- Yes, darling.
- Mm-hm.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.495
Thank you, Lorenzo.

33:00.583 --> 33:05.497
Now, in the scanning speech,
we look for both ends of the pathology:

33:05.584 --> 33:09.933
Centrally for the dysphasia,
and peripherally for the dysarthria.

33:11.237 --> 33:14.500
Now, Lorenzo, would you
walk for me, please?

33:16.109 --> 33:17.804
Attaboy.

33:19.022 --> 33:21.675
That's right. Hold my hands.

33:21.849 --> 33:23.894
That's right.

33:25.285 --> 33:30.025
Two months ago there was simply motor
lag. Now note the characteristic gait.

33:30.199 --> 33:35.983
It's due mostly to hyperreflexia, but
exacerbated by the encroaching paresis.

33:36.854 --> 33:38.897
You're doing very well. Keep coming.

33:39.028 --> 33:43.768
Only if you stop talking like that.

34:19.213 --> 34:22.126
Hello, Mr Odone. Have I got that right?

34:22.255 --> 34:24.996
<i>- Odo-ne.</i>
- Odo-ne? I'm sorry.

34:25.127 --> 34:27.954
Ellard Muscatine.
I'm with the ALD Foundation.

34:28.040 --> 34:32.389
We heard about your boy Lorenzo,
and we'd like to offer you some help.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.433
<i>You're a doctor?</i>

34:34.521 --> 34:39.652
Doctor? Heck, no. I'm a machinist from
Allequippa, PA, but I'm an ALD parent.

34:39.739 --> 34:45.349
This is my second time around, so I know
exactly what you're going through.

34:46.481 --> 34:50.177
My wife Loretta and I,
we run the foundation.

34:51.177 --> 34:55.525
We organize counseling,
conduct seminars, fund research.

34:55.656 --> 34:58.135
We have 500 member families,
not only American,

34:58.266 --> 35:02.484
but from Portugal,
Israel, Japan, Australia...

35:02.614 --> 35:05.441
And we're growing all the time.

35:05.573 --> 35:09.530
We wanted you and Mrs Odone
to know that you're not alone.

35:18.793 --> 35:21.838
Hi. Ellard Muscatine.
Welcome to the conference.

35:21.924 --> 35:24.360
- Augusto Odone.
- Michaela.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.360
Oh, very nice to meet you.
Please come in.

35:28.535 --> 35:31.492
This is my wife Loretta,
and these are the Odones.

35:31.666 --> 35:34.319
Great. I'm so happy
you were able to come.

35:34.449 --> 35:37.711
Because I think a lot of it is denial.

35:37.841 --> 35:42.060
We don't want to say anything's going
on. We're strong and we can handle it.

35:42.625 --> 35:46.888
But this is the place and
this is the time to let it all out,

35:47.974 --> 35:50.192
let the barriers come down

35:50.280 --> 35:53.541
and to share your feelings
and get it off your chest.

35:53.672 --> 35:57.368
It's hard to believe that
things can get worse.

35:59.195 --> 36:01.239
But they will.

36:02.631 --> 36:05.501
One thing nobody wants to
talk about is what happens,

36:05.588 --> 36:08.589
or does not happen, between
the two of you in the bedroom.

36:08.719 --> 36:10.850
A whole year
we couldn't touch each other.

36:11.415 --> 36:16.156
My husband stood by me all the way
but, oh my, does it test the men!

36:16.243 --> 36:19.461
- And the weak ones just up and go.
- Even the strong ones leave.

36:19.548 --> 36:24.115
My guy hung in there when our first boy
took sick. Then we had little Jake tested.

36:24.245 --> 36:27.594
Arlen wanted a whole bunch of boys,
a whole ball team.

36:27.681 --> 36:31.291
He's gonna have 'em too...
with some other gal.

36:32.682 --> 36:34.769
We'd like to thank the parents

36:34.943 --> 36:38.988
who gave so generously to the fund
for the immunosuppression trial.

36:39.118 --> 36:42.467
The doctors have said that
this experiment contributed greatly

36:42.598 --> 36:45.120
to the understanding of ALD.

36:45.250 --> 36:49.600
Betty and Tom Knowles,
$250 in memory of Corey.

36:49.774 --> 36:53.818
Dr and Mrs Liebowitz,
$500 in memory of Joel.

36:53.949 --> 36:58.949
Mr and Mrs Higgins,
$1,000 in memory of Adrian and Julian.

36:59.080 --> 37:03.082
26 people have sent in
recipes for the newsletter.

37:03.168 --> 37:06.821
Now, we still need ideas for
snack foods and breakfast treats.

37:06.952 --> 37:09.909
Remember, all recipes should be
low-fat

37:10.040 --> 37:13.171
and use only the foods
allowed on the institute diet.

37:13.258 --> 37:15.433
- Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am?

37:15.519 --> 37:17.737
Our son has complied with this diet,

37:17.825 --> 37:23.000
but his levels of saturated C24 and
C26 have risen for two months in a row.

37:23.086 --> 37:25.478
That's exactly what's happened to Jaybird.

37:25.608 --> 37:29.479
Ah, well, perhaps before we talk
about publishing cookbooks,

37:29.610 --> 37:34.655
we should ask ourselves
if the diet is working at all.

37:36.525 --> 37:39.177
- Shouldn't we?
- Damn right we should.

37:39.309 --> 37:41.352
This is not the way we do things here.

37:41.439 --> 37:46.397
But there are two families here
with this paradox. Maybe there are more.

37:46.527 --> 37:48.615
Shouldn't we open it for discussion?

37:48.745 --> 37:52.225
- My boy's levels are rising.
- Now there are three families.

37:52.311 --> 37:56.095
So maybe we should...
Could we have a show of hands?

37:56.226 --> 37:58.487
Then we'll see how many
families there are.

37:58.661 --> 38:02.923
You don't understand. This is a formal
pilot study. It has to run for six months.

38:03.053 --> 38:05.968
We're not scientists.
We don't interpret experiments.

38:06.098 --> 38:08.925
That's the solemn
responsibility of the doctors.

38:09.099 --> 38:11.447
Come on, Ellard!
Let's have a show of hands.

38:11.577 --> 38:13.621
No, that would be misleading.

38:13.752 --> 38:17.057
The medical folks call
this kind of evidence anecdotal.

38:17.144 --> 38:20.580
- What's wrong with a show of hands?
- It wouldn't have any meaning.

38:20.710 --> 38:23.493
- Excuse me. May I say something?
- Sure.

38:23.581 --> 38:29.017
The only way that the doctors can get
useful results is with a strict protocol

38:29.147 --> 38:31.887
and statistical samples
in a control group.

38:32.061 --> 38:34.801
And a proper time frame.
Doctors have to be careful.

38:34.888 --> 38:38.106
Clinical trials must withstand
a tremendous amount of scrutiny.

38:38.236 --> 38:40.977
This is the way that
medical science works.

38:41.107 --> 38:44.760
That's the only way the scientists
can get the information they need.

38:44.891 --> 38:51.066
So what you're saying is that our children
are in the service of medical science.

38:51.196 --> 38:53.241
How foolish of me. I always assumed

38:53.371 --> 38:57.242
that medical science
was in the service of the sufferers.

38:57.372 --> 38:59.416
Yes. Uh, thank you.

39:00.155 --> 39:02.895
Uh, now I think it's time
we get back to our agenda.

39:03.026 --> 39:08.723
Why? So we can discuss further salvaging
our marriages and managing our grief?

39:08.853 --> 39:13.463
What about the children?
No one here is discussing the children.

39:14.725 --> 39:17.029
Thank you.

39:17.160 --> 39:21.596
Now if Mary has nothing further to add,
I would like to introduce Dr Chapel

39:21.769 --> 39:24.640
to talk about the nasogastric tube
and suction machine.

39:24.770 --> 39:28.250
Would you all join me
in giving him a very warm welcome?

39:35.512 --> 39:39.427
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you, Ellard. Ladies and gentlemen...

39:59.040 --> 40:02.128
- Now hold my hand.
- Yes, sweetie.

40:20.742 --> 40:24.264
- Now the story.
- What story is that, sweetheart?

40:25.482 --> 40:28.744
<i>La notte di San Lorenzo.</i>

40:28.831 --> 40:30.657
San Lorenzo, who is...?

40:30.745 --> 40:33.006
My patron saint.

40:33.137 --> 40:36.354
And saint of my father's village.

40:36.485 --> 40:39.225
That's right. And what happened to him?

40:39.399 --> 40:41.834
He was in Rome.

40:41.965 --> 40:44.009
Mm-hm.

40:44.922 --> 40:47.488
And... I forgot.

40:48.793 --> 40:51.228
Well, many years ago

40:51.359 --> 40:56.969
the bad guy says to him
"Bring us the riches of your church."

40:57.969 --> 41:04.188
And Lorenzo, he brings them
the beggars and the sick people

41:05.363 --> 41:09.320
- and he says...
- "These are our riches."

41:09.494 --> 41:10.886
Yes!

41:11.016 --> 41:15.712
- Bravo, Lorenzo, bravo.
- That's wonderful, sweetheart. So clever.

41:15.843 --> 41:18.627
And tonight, August 10th, is...

41:19.322 --> 41:24.106
<i>La notte di San Lorenzo.</i>

41:24.802 --> 41:27.063
The night of the shooting stars.

41:27.238 --> 41:29.673
When anything can happen.

41:56.288 --> 41:57.767
Micha...

41:57.897 --> 41:59.942
Sh, sh, sh.

42:01.116 --> 42:05.161
When we first went to the Comoros,
what did we do?

42:06.770 --> 42:09.509
- We got to know the country, right?
- Yes.

42:09.640 --> 42:14.032
We studied. We got to know
the language, resources, its laws.

42:14.206 --> 42:16.250
We studied, right?

42:17.120 --> 42:21.295
We should treat Lorenzo's illness
like another country.

42:21.382 --> 42:24.383
- I don't quite see the analogy.
- All right, all right.

42:24.470 --> 42:27.297
- ALD has many dimensions, right?
- Yes.

42:27.427 --> 42:33.473
So in order to understand it, we need
a command of genetics, biochemistry,

42:33.603 --> 42:36.778
microbiology, neurology, ology-ology...

42:36.951 --> 42:39.561
Augusto, we don't have time
to go to medical school.

42:39.691 --> 42:43.910
Michaela, the doctors are in the dark.
They're groping in the dark.

42:44.040 --> 42:47.520
They've got Lorenzo
on a turvy-topsy diet.

42:47.606 --> 42:52.825
And that bloody immunosuppression
is brutal and useless.

42:52.999 --> 42:57.957
Michaela, we should not have
consigned him blindly into their hands.

42:58.914 --> 43:02.175
He should not suffer by our ignorance.

43:02.306 --> 43:06.655
We take responsibility.
So... we read a little.

43:07.612 --> 43:10.308
And we go out and inform ourselves.

43:11.787 --> 43:16.527
But... to miss time with him
while he can still speak to us...

43:16.657 --> 43:20.963
Yes, I know, I know.
But he expects it of us.

44:08.236 --> 44:10.933
I want to take Lorenzo off the diet.

44:11.107 --> 44:14.759
He's been eating cardboard for 19 weeks,
and what's it getting us?

44:14.891 --> 44:19.283
- And feed him what?
- Normal foods. Things a child likes.

44:19.457 --> 44:22.718
Full of the long-chain fats
that we know destroy his myelin?

44:22.805 --> 44:26.763
Look. On the diet,
his blood fats are still rising.

44:26.937 --> 44:29.503
- Yes, I know, Michaela.
- It doesn't make any sense.

44:29.676 --> 44:32.765
But we don't know enough.
We don't know enough.

44:32.851 --> 44:35.243
We don't know it clearly enough.

44:35.330 --> 44:37.635
Here, Michaela,
let me show you something.

44:37.766 --> 44:39.809
All right, here.

44:40.941 --> 44:42.984
<i>Un piccolo acquaio.</i>

44:43.115 --> 44:46.855
- A kitchen sink?
- Yes, yes. Little kitchen sink.

44:46.985 --> 44:50.334
All right. Now here is the tap. Mm-hm?

44:50.421 --> 44:53.466
And here's the sink basin
and the plug hole, right?

44:53.552 --> 44:59.293
All right. Very long-chain saturated fats
are introduced by what we eat, right?

44:59.424 --> 45:02.033
- Yes?
- Now, also produced by the body

45:02.207 --> 45:05.860
or manufactured by the body,
these very same fats.

45:05.991 --> 45:08.687
- Biosynthesis.
- Biosynthesis, right.

45:08.817 --> 45:11.079
Now, normally they are not harmful

45:11.209 --> 45:15.993
because this enzyme
eliminate the excess, right?

45:16.645 --> 45:21.299
But in Lorenzo, this enzyme
is defective from genetics.

45:21.429 --> 45:24.604
His plug hole is blocked, right?

45:24.734 --> 45:25.822
Yes.

45:25.909 --> 45:30.432
We know that very long-chain saturated
fats are made up of carbon atoms.

45:30.606 --> 45:33.780
C2, 4, 6, 8...
all the way up the chain, right?

45:34.651 --> 45:41.130
But in Lorenzo,
the saturated C24 and C26

45:41.260 --> 45:44.653
rise to four times the normal level.

45:46.609 --> 45:51.785
OK, now, here's where we have
a little paradox, a mystery, OK?

45:53.134 --> 45:58.222
Why, when we reduce the dietary intake
of saturated fats,

45:58.352 --> 46:03.527
does the level in our sink, which
we would expect to go down, go up?

46:04.180 --> 46:07.963
So, logically, we should
take him off the diet.

46:08.051 --> 46:10.311
Well, Michaela,

46:10.443 --> 46:13.443
just as logically, we should not.

46:13.574 --> 46:16.096
Because let's not do
what the doctors did.

46:16.183 --> 46:19.010
Let's not act without knowing why.

46:20.184 --> 46:25.228
Why, when we turn off this tap,
does the level in our sink rise?

46:28.055 --> 46:29.708
I married a plumber.

46:29.795 --> 46:34.753
You married a man with a simple mind,
who asks simple questions, that's all.

46:34.884 --> 46:37.014
Here, Michaela. Brain food.

46:37.102 --> 46:39.450
- Come on.
- Oh. Thank you.

47:38.378 --> 47:42.597
Polish rats! I think I have
an explanation for the paradox.

47:42.728 --> 47:45.206
Lorenzo, kiss your clever mother.

47:45.859 --> 47:51.512
Polish rats with a fatty-acid storage
disease. Let me use your kitchen sink.

47:53.861 --> 47:57.210
Here's our tap for what we eat.

47:59.254 --> 48:01.732
And here's our tap for biosynthesis.

48:01.820 --> 48:04.080
I see. Biosynthesis. Mm-hm.

48:05.428 --> 48:09.952
When the rats were deprived
of a specific fat in their diet,

48:10.126 --> 48:14.083
their body cells compensated
by overproducing it.

48:14.171 --> 48:17.562
- So if this holds true for humans...
- Then the diet is useless

48:17.649 --> 48:21.781
unless we can stop it overproducing,
slow down biosynthesis, <i>sì?</i>

48:21.912 --> 48:26.478
Yes, and there's more. And for this,
I deserve two kisses, my darling.

48:28.130 --> 48:32.001
In the summary, it talks about
the concept of fatty-acid manipulation.

48:32.088 --> 48:34.046
- What's that?
- Well,

48:34.132 --> 48:38.089
they stop the rats
producing one kind of fat

48:39.525 --> 48:41.960
by loading their diet with another kind.

48:42.091 --> 48:47.005
So maybe we could stop Lorenzo's body
from producing C24 and C26

48:47.136 --> 48:51.485
by loading his diet with another kind
of fat, one that's less harmful.

48:51.615 --> 48:54.485
We should have this translated
as soon as possible.

48:54.616 --> 48:57.704
I have some news too.

48:57.790 --> 49:00.008
It's a letter from Omouri.

49:00.182 --> 49:03.401
He wouldn't open it until you got home.

49:03.531 --> 49:06.010
- Omouri.
- Yes.

49:11.881 --> 49:14.012
Michaela, by tomorrow morning,

49:14.143 --> 49:18.274
your Polish rats will be
speaking to us in English. Hm?

49:20.057 --> 49:22.145
I've been thinking.

49:24.188 --> 49:28.407
I found that article by accident.
I just as easily could have missed it.

49:28.581 --> 49:33.322
It was written by a Polish biochemist,
who I'm sure knew nothing about ALD.

49:34.756 --> 49:38.627
Well, Michaela, still it gives us
a new line of inquiry.

49:38.714 --> 49:40.672
Yes, but it could take months.

49:40.758 --> 49:44.759
And there will be other leads that take
more time, and it's time we don't have.

49:44.889 --> 49:51.630
All these experts, working in isolation,
each one on his own piece of the jigsaw.

49:53.631 --> 49:58.458
Of course, a symposium is the best way
to accelerate the exchange of information.

49:58.546 --> 50:01.721
In that sense,
it's a very good idea, Mr Odone.

50:01.807 --> 50:04.069
Only... May I say something?

50:05.025 --> 50:09.505
Have you any idea how many children
in the United States die every year

50:09.635 --> 50:12.593
from choking on French fries?

50:12.723 --> 50:17.203
Many more than from
adrenoleukodystrophy.

50:17.289 --> 50:19.812
Ours is what is known as
an orphan disease.

50:19.942 --> 50:23.900
It's too small to be noticed,
too small to be funded,

50:24.031 --> 50:27.640
especially with the iron hand
of Reaganomics.

50:27.727 --> 50:33.164
So while, as I say, this remains a very
good idea, it's a luxury we can't afford.

50:33.294 --> 50:37.643
Well, we appreciate that,
so we have prepared a budget

50:37.774 --> 50:40.208
based on 40 participants for two days.

50:40.296 --> 50:44.732
We think it can be done for $35,000.
My wife and I will raise the money.

50:44.818 --> 50:48.167
- We can't ask you to bear the cost.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

50:48.298 --> 50:50.907
That's the least of our concern.

50:51.038 --> 50:54.256
And of course, your institute
will not be at risk

50:54.386 --> 50:59.170
because the Odones
will underwrite any shortfall.

51:00.432 --> 51:04.258
And we took the liberty
of drafting an invitation list.

51:04.432 --> 51:07.999
Forgive me, Dr Nikolais.
We wish to make two conditions.

51:08.129 --> 51:12.478
We would like the symposium
to emphasize therapy,

51:12.608 --> 51:17.741
and Michaela and myself would like
to participate in the discussion.

51:27.351 --> 51:31.396
Martha, I'm afraid we'll have to
add to your workload,

51:31.526 --> 51:34.310
but it's in a very good cause.

51:34.483 --> 51:38.702
We've decided to convene
the first symposium on ALD.

51:39.790 --> 51:42.573
We should notify the Muscatines.

51:42.703 --> 51:46.313
Of course. The foundation could
help with the arrangement.

51:46.399 --> 51:50.879
They could even, perhaps...
find some funds.

51:52.619 --> 51:57.055
How about we hook it to the back of
the next Foundation Family Conference?

51:57.185 --> 52:00.273
<i>- When would that be?</i>
- Next summer. 4th of July.

52:00.404 --> 52:03.361
<i>- That's nine months away!</i>
- It will take us all that time

52:03.492 --> 52:06.188
to invite those busy doctors
and raise the money.

52:06.318 --> 52:09.624
<i>- I don't think so.</i>
- What's your time frame, Mrs Odone?

52:09.754 --> 52:13.102
<i>- Five weeks from now. November 10th.</i>
- That's not possible.

52:13.276 --> 52:14.973
<i>Oh, I think it is.</i>

52:15.059 --> 52:17.277
Pardon me,
but what is the point of rushing?

52:19.799 --> 52:23.932
As ALD parents, we both know
the answer to that inane question.

52:24.018 --> 52:27.193
<i>If you want this to happen,
you're going about it the wrong way.</i>

52:27.324 --> 52:30.194
At least we are going about it.

52:30.325 --> 52:33.282
- Sorry, I don't understand.
- He wants his diaper changed.

52:33.368 --> 52:36.674
Mrs Muscatine, look... Hello?

52:37.631 --> 52:39.588
Hello?

52:39.718 --> 52:42.719
They should be hung by their eyelashes.

52:42.806 --> 52:45.328
- They won't help?
- It doesn't look that way.

52:45.458 --> 52:47.503
- Good boy. I'll take him.
- No, I got it.

52:47.590 --> 52:50.547
- What'll you do? Mortgage the house?
- Not until I have to.

52:50.677 --> 52:52.156
Michaela!

53:01.898 --> 53:05.290
I've spent two months pulling
on the heartstrings of Washington

53:05.464 --> 53:10.074
to raise money for multiple sclerosis,
sudden infant death and cystic fibrosis.

53:10.204 --> 53:12.423
Then why exclude adrenoleukodystrophy?

53:12.596 --> 53:16.685
Because I also cover politics,
the arts, women's issues and stuff,

53:16.815 --> 53:19.555
and my readership likes
to have a little balance.

53:19.685 --> 53:24.426
I cannot do another medical story
right now. Maybe in another month.

53:26.209 --> 53:28.861
Joyce, I think you should meet my son.

53:33.428 --> 53:35.472
My friends...

53:36.255 --> 53:38.734
This is so generous.

53:38.908 --> 53:42.865
You know, Augusto, our wives
are eager to form a committee

53:42.952 --> 53:46.735
- to, perhaps, help with hospitality.
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful.

53:49.606 --> 53:53.302
Not only will we be saving money,
but they'll be extremely well fed.

53:53.390 --> 53:57.435
For breakfast, French pastry, correct?
Lunch, UN finger food.

53:57.521 --> 54:00.652
The British will do afternoon tea.

54:00.827 --> 54:04.393
And for dinner, I know
a marvelous Italian cook.

54:07.306 --> 54:11.699
Are you needin' another pair of hands?
I'll lick envelopes, serve coffee, whatever.

54:11.829 --> 54:15.613
And this is for your boy. I grow
the best organic produce in Virginia.

54:15.744 --> 54:18.570
- Thank you.
- You don't remember me!

54:18.744 --> 54:23.006
Wendy Gimble. Foundation Family
Conference. I yelled louder than you.

54:23.136 --> 54:28.617
- Yes, of course. You have two boys.
- We lost Jaybird, but Jake here is fine.

54:28.747 --> 54:30.835
We think what you're doing is fantastic.

54:30.921 --> 54:33.183
Hello, Jake. Come on in. Thank you.

54:33.357 --> 54:38.402
When I read about what you were doing,
I thought "It's time we did something."

54:38.488 --> 54:42.316
- Please, come in and meet the others.
- Is that Lorenzo?

54:42.403 --> 54:46.665
Yes. Lorenzo, this is Jake.
He's a young man of your age.

54:46.752 --> 54:51.536
Look, Lorenzo, a great big pumpkin.
Let's go down and feel how big it is.

54:55.971 --> 54:58.407
What, sweetheart?

55:00.842 --> 55:04.061
I'm sorry, Lorenzo.
Let's try that again.

55:27.284 --> 55:29.894
This morning I could still understand him.

55:35.982 --> 55:41.027
When we can clone the ALD gene,
we can identify the deficient enzyme,

55:41.201 --> 55:44.549
mass-produce the gene,
implant it into ALD sufferers

55:44.679 --> 55:48.942
- and normalize their metabolism.
- How long would that take?

55:54.030 --> 55:55.770
Seven to ten years.

55:55.856 --> 55:58.727
You see, science has its own time,

55:58.857 --> 56:02.423
and, very often, any new advance
can be a matter of serendipity.

56:02.555 --> 56:06.337
For the last six months,
all our ALD boys have been on a regimen

56:06.468 --> 56:10.687
which excludes saturated C24 and 26.

56:11.470 --> 56:14.383
But despite this restriction in the diet,

56:14.471 --> 56:18.732
these long-chain fatty acids
have remained the same,

56:18.819 --> 56:21.689
in some cases even increasing.

56:22.429 --> 56:27.909
Now, this compensating increase
I put down to biosynthesis.

56:27.996 --> 56:31.344
But, Gus, if you could maintain the diet

56:31.475 --> 56:35.128
and somehow inhibit biosynthesis,
you'd have a therapy.

56:35.302 --> 56:37.738
No, you wouldn't quite have a therapy.

56:37.868 --> 56:41.955
You would have a way of
lowering the fatty acids to normal.

56:49.914 --> 56:53.394
If you wish to inhibit biosynthesis,

56:53.480 --> 56:57.134
have you considered
fatty-acid manipulation?

57:06.614 --> 57:11.659
There is some literature,
a rat study, Russian or Polish.

57:11.833 --> 57:14.660
Polish. Straszak.
I have copies right here.

57:14.790 --> 57:19.053
<i>Polish Journal of Biological Sciences
1979, Volume II.</i>

57:19.139 --> 57:23.445
They loaded the diet with one fat
and decreased biosynthesis of another.

57:23.531 --> 57:26.490
Yes, I remember this article.

57:26.620 --> 57:31.708
And also in Canada, they have seen
the same thing in miniature swine.

57:31.839 --> 57:35.144
As a matter of fact,
I've seen it in human cells.

57:35.274 --> 57:37.274
In human ALD cells.

57:37.405 --> 57:42.146
From patients with ALD,
I took fibroblasts ‒ skin cells, OK?

57:42.276 --> 57:44.494
Each one carries the same genetic defect.

57:44.624 --> 57:49.452
I incubated them with oleic acid and
reduced the saturated C24 and C26

57:49.582 --> 57:52.191
- by more than 50 per cent.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

57:52.322 --> 57:55.018
You said oleic acid?

57:55.453 --> 57:58.758
Yes, monounsaturated C18,
the main component of olive oil.

57:58.889 --> 58:02.238
- Surely this is the basis for a therapy.
- Slow down.

58:02.368 --> 58:06.457
These are studies in cultured cells. We
don't know it'll work in a human being.

58:06.587 --> 58:10.674
Well, then, take the olive oil
and try it in a patient and see...

58:10.805 --> 58:15.632
Augusto, olive oil is forbidden
in the diet: C24, C26.

58:15.763 --> 58:19.591
Yes, but then use whatever
Dr Rizzo fed his fibroblast.

58:19.677 --> 58:24.809
Pure oleic acid would be very toxic to
an intact organism, an animal or human.

58:24.896 --> 58:29.724
It would need to be the triglyceride form,
which is edible, but that's not available.

58:29.897 --> 58:34.594
All right, can't you take ordinary
olive oil and extract the C24 and C26?

58:34.724 --> 58:39.683
You could, but it's a very complicated
procedure and would be very expensive,

58:39.813 --> 58:43.074
especially to produce the quantities
for a clinical trial.

58:43.205 --> 58:45.380
Have you contacted chemical companies?

58:45.553 --> 58:47.598
No one will tool up for that.

58:47.684 --> 58:52.250
Not for an experiment,
not for something with no market.

58:52.382 --> 58:54.860
- Then you haven't tried?
- No.

58:59.905 --> 59:05.167
If we were able to get triglyceride,
then we can change all that, right?

59:05.254 --> 59:08.211
Yes. It has to be triglyceride
to be edible.

59:08.342 --> 59:10.430
Edible form. Triglyceride.

59:10.560 --> 59:12.560
<i>No one here can help you.</i>

59:12.691 --> 59:15.126
<i>Then do you know anyone else who does?</i>

59:15.213 --> 59:17.432
<i>I'll send you back to the switchboard.</i>

59:17.562 --> 59:21.737
<i>- Which extension, please?
- Research and development.</i>

59:21.867 --> 59:22.867
<i>R&D.</i>

59:22.998 --> 59:26.259
- I need a triglyceride form of oleic acid.
<i>- Your name, Doctor?</i>

59:26.347 --> 59:28.782
- No, I'm not a doctor.
<i>- Are you with a company?</i>

59:28.913 --> 59:32.305
No, I am not with any company.
I'm the mother of a sick child.

59:32.391 --> 59:33.740
<i>- A mother?</i>
- That's right.

59:33.870 --> 59:35.653
<i>- And you want...?</i>
- Oleic acid.

59:35.741 --> 59:37.436
<i>- The lines are busy.</i>
- I'll wait.

59:37.567 --> 59:40.872
Papa makes you
<i>spaghetti al pomodoro,</i>

59:41.046 --> 59:45.786
seasoned with <i>basilico,</i>
the royal herb for our prince.

59:45.917 --> 59:48.440
Badabib, badabab, badaboom.

59:50.049 --> 59:53.875
Come on, Lorenzo, take a little bit.
That's a boy.

59:54.006 --> 59:56.572
The best lead came
from the symposium:

59:56.702 --> 01:00:01.051
Oleic acid in the triglyceride form.
Now it's our only hope for Lorenzo.

01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:04.922
<i>Don't fret, Mrs Odone.
You will hear from him within the hour.</i>

01:00:05.096 --> 01:00:07.792
<i>- You can be sure of it.</i>
- Thank you. That's 301...

01:00:07.879 --> 01:00:09.836
<i>Don't worry, I have the number.</i>

01:00:09.967 --> 01:00:13.228
- Thank you very much.
<i>- You're welcome. Bye-bye.</i>

01:00:17.273 --> 01:00:23.493
So, as the swallowing reflexes weaken,
he's less able to handle his own saliva.

01:00:24.275 --> 01:00:29.319
We'll all have to be pretty vigilant. We
really have to stay on top of this thing.

01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:34.321
If we allow any saliva to get down into
his respiratory tract, we block his airway.

01:00:34.495 --> 01:00:36.583
We don't wanna do that.

01:00:36.713 --> 01:00:38.801
Here we go. Put your
thumb over the valve.

01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:41.453
When you don't want suction,
release your thumb.

01:00:41.584 --> 01:00:46.151
Hi. It's ProtoChem again.
I'll connect you to our Mr Pellerman.

01:00:53.457 --> 01:00:57.501
- I believe you want some oleic acid.
<i>- Yes, in triglyceride form.</i>

01:00:57.632 --> 01:01:01.850
You're lucky. We're testing a glycerol
trioleate here as an industrial lubricant.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.373
<i>Industrial? Then... is it fit
for human consumption?</i>

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.677
I don't see why not.
It's a purified olive oil.

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:12.984
<i>Without saturates? Pure monounsaturated
C18 in triglyceride form?</i>

01:01:13.114 --> 01:01:14.810
- Yes, ma'am.
<i>- You're sure?</i>

01:01:14.897 --> 01:01:18.115
It happens we have one bottle here,
sitting idle on the shelf.

01:01:18.245 --> 01:01:21.464
<i>Marvelous! How can we
get our hands on it?</i>

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:24.030
- Sorry. Go ahead.
<i>- How can we get our hands on it?</i>

01:01:25.465 --> 01:01:27.552
This is... beautiful.

01:01:28.248 --> 01:01:32.076
- And it's entirely harmless?
- Gus, you're talking to an Italian.

01:01:32.206 --> 01:01:36.772
- It's only olive oil.
- Yes, that's harmless. It's like... sugar.

01:01:36.946 --> 01:01:39.817
And yet, to a diabetic,
sugar can be lethal.

01:01:39.903 --> 01:01:44.992
You see, the trouble is we don't know to
what extent Lorenzo can metabolize fats.

01:01:45.122 --> 01:01:50.341
Yes, well, Gus, it's been seven months
since Lorenzo was diagnosed.

01:01:50.515 --> 01:01:53.168
Now he is silent. He's immobile.

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.299
Augusto, I am a scientist,

01:01:56.429 --> 01:01:59.735
and I'm of absolutely
no use to you whatever

01:01:59.909 --> 01:02:02.345
unless I can maintain my objectivity.

01:02:02.431 --> 01:02:05.736
And I am not a scientist. I am a father.

01:02:05.823 --> 01:02:10.477
And nobody can tell me what dressing
I put on my kid's salad, OK?

01:02:12.955 --> 01:02:15.000
Augusto...

01:02:15.652 --> 01:02:19.261
This science of medicine.
You know, it's not like physics.

01:02:19.392 --> 01:02:22.653
There's no mathematical certainty.

01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:28.655
And because we deal with human beings
who suffer, it can appear heartless.

01:02:28.786 --> 01:02:30.830
I know.

01:02:35.222 --> 01:02:39.528
You realize that any collaboration
of mine would have to be unofficial?

01:02:39.658 --> 01:02:44.095
<i>Sì, sì,</i> of course. Now, the dose.
We think 40 grams a day.

01:02:44.225 --> 01:02:47.269
- That's too much. Say 30.
- 30?

01:02:47.399 --> 01:02:51.313
Yes. Any more than that
might damage your son's liver.

01:02:51.444 --> 01:02:53.705
Darling, they're about to start.

01:02:56.532 --> 01:03:00.837
We're going to send this blood away
to establish a baseline, my brave boy.

01:03:00.968 --> 01:03:05.230
Because today we all start
the fight against the boo-boo.

01:03:05.317 --> 01:03:07.709
There. All done.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.103
Lorenzino, this year we celebrate
Thanksgiving a little early

01:03:15.233 --> 01:03:19.364
with a fine barracuda
like we used to eat in the Comoros, huh?

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:23.104
And Papa has cooked it
with the aromatic dill.

01:03:23.235 --> 01:03:25.279
And now

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:31.150
we add the special olive oil
which Mama found.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.324
Hm? All right?

01:03:35.281 --> 01:03:37.326
There we go.

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:39.065
Deirdre.

01:03:39.239 --> 01:03:42.196
All right, Lorenzo. Here we go.

01:04:07.942 --> 01:04:13.118
- There we go.
- You did good, buddy boy. Real good.

01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:17.728
Your Aunt Deirdre means "well", darling.
In this house, we cherish our adverbs.

01:04:17.858 --> 01:04:21.598
I expect you to do the same
when you get your voice back.

01:05:02.305 --> 01:05:05.392
- Hello?
<i>- Mrs Odone, this is Dr Nikolais's office.</i>

01:05:05.523 --> 01:05:10.046
<i>I have Lorenzo's results. There's been a
small drop in the saturated C24 and 26.</i>

01:05:10.176 --> 01:05:12.307
<i>- About 15 percent.</i>
- 15 per cent?

01:05:12.438 --> 01:05:16.873
<i>Dr Nikolais said not to get carried away.
It could be a spontaneous variation.</i>

01:05:17.004 --> 01:05:20.918
- Am I allowed a tiny squeak of joy?
<i>- We'll know more next month.</i>

01:05:21.005 --> 01:05:22.223
Thank you.

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.316
Michaela!

01:05:54.535 --> 01:05:57.232
Augusto! Get something
to hold down his tongue!

01:05:57.362 --> 01:05:59.407
Oh, my baby!

01:06:07.626 --> 01:06:11.670
So, this is a kind of seizure,
like epilepsy?

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:16.411
No, not a seizure. It's a paroxysm.
It's triggered by saliva in the windpipe.

01:06:16.498 --> 01:06:18.803
- But we suction him.
- Regularly.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:22.021
I know, but even so, some saliva
gets caught in the trachea.

01:06:22.107 --> 01:06:24.978
In any other child,
a cough would get rid of it.

01:06:25.108 --> 01:06:27.979
In Lorenzo, it becomes
a scrambled chain of reflexes

01:06:28.153 --> 01:06:31.415
that amplifies into
what you have just seen.

01:06:31.501 --> 01:06:34.329
If this happens again,
what can we do about it?

01:06:34.416 --> 01:06:36.677
Just help him try to ride it out.

01:06:37.547 --> 01:06:41.157
We're all flying blind here, folks.
The best I can offer is sedation.

01:06:41.287 --> 01:06:47.071
But if it's not epilepsy, then he's aware
of what's happening while it's going on?

01:06:47.157 --> 01:06:49.202
Well, it's possible.

01:06:49.942 --> 01:06:54.073
And if he has another episode,
we could talk him through it.

01:06:54.203 --> 01:06:56.334
It's possible, Michaela.

01:06:56.508 --> 01:06:58.552
It's possible.

01:07:01.335 --> 01:07:04.424
- A 50 per cent drop, right?
<i>- That's correct.</i>

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.467
Thank you very much. Thank you!

01:07:06.598 --> 01:07:08.816
<i>Fantastico! Fantastico!</i>

01:07:19.688 --> 01:07:24.646
I very well understand that we are not
scientists, but we have observed this...

01:07:24.776 --> 01:07:29.256
<i>Let us do it our way,
Augusto. Trust us.</i>

01:07:29.386 --> 01:07:31.431
<i>- I've got to go.</i>
- OK. Thank you.

01:07:31.604 --> 01:07:33.040
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:37.476
- Nikolais says it's very interesting.
- Interesting? A 50 per cent drop?

01:07:37.606 --> 01:07:41.346
But it's too early to draw a conclusion.
Rizzo might consider a trial.

01:07:41.476 --> 01:07:44.738
And he asked us
not to tell the other parents.

01:07:44.868 --> 01:07:47.522
- What?!
- It's immoral. Something finally...

01:07:47.652 --> 01:07:51.218
- The parents have to know.
- We'll tell them. They can judge.

01:07:51.305 --> 01:07:54.915
- The foundation has a mailing list.
- We'll call the Muscatines.

01:07:55.045 --> 01:07:58.133
I can eat crow
in the name of a good cause.

01:08:01.047 --> 01:08:03.091
Michaela...

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:10.701
Mm! Delicious! That was worth
driving 300 miles for.

01:08:10.832 --> 01:08:14.746
- Now, my friends... dessert.
- Here, let me move this.

01:08:15.834 --> 01:08:18.747
And Loretta... a little science, hm?

01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:21.618
Thank you.

01:08:22.531 --> 01:08:24.575
"Dear ALD parents..."

01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:37.709
- You want us to send this out?
- Yes. We'll pay for copying and postage.

01:08:38.404 --> 01:08:40.448
But you're advocating a therapy.

01:08:40.535 --> 01:08:45.059
No, we're merely reporting
a positive advancement in the diet.

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:47.798
It would be wrong to keep it
from the other parents.

01:08:47.971 --> 01:08:52.017
Mrs Odone, we have an advisory board
of eminent doctors

01:08:52.147 --> 01:08:54.234
and we take our guidance from them.

01:08:54.365 --> 01:08:56.756
They <i>are</i> the ones
with the medical degrees.

01:08:56.886 --> 01:09:00.758
Yes, my dear, but Nikolais
already knows about this

01:09:00.889 --> 01:09:05.368
- and the wretched man does nothing.
- Because he is a responsible scientist.

01:09:05.499 --> 01:09:10.194
- No, because he has another agenda.
- All right, Michaela. <i>Calmati, calmati.</i>

01:09:10.326 --> 01:09:12.805
You know, Loretta, sometimes

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:19.676
the interest of the scientists is not
the same as the interest of the parents.

01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:23.938
Scientists are human
and sometimes they can be wrong.

01:09:24.069 --> 01:09:29.548
As president of the foundation,
you represent us, the families.

01:09:29.636 --> 01:09:34.594
And you serve the families best
by informing them.

01:09:34.724 --> 01:09:40.117
And all we ask is that you please
send this letter to them, that's all.

01:09:40.203 --> 01:09:46.075
Our parents suffer enough without
being made the victims of false hopes.

01:09:46.205 --> 01:09:50.423
We can't give credence to every jerk
with a pocketful of apricot seeds.

01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:54.555
Excuse me, this is not Laetrile. We're
talking about an extract of olive oil,

01:09:54.642 --> 01:09:58.121
an idea that was put forth
by the scientists at the symposium.

01:09:58.208 --> 01:10:00.252
And it works in Lorenzo.

01:10:00.383 --> 01:10:03.949
It works in an ALD boy
to a degree that is significant.

01:10:04.036 --> 01:10:08.950
- Very significant.
- Other parents have a right to know.

01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:13.908
We know that this is a deadly disease,
so they have a right to choice.

01:10:14.038 --> 01:10:17.909
And if they feel as we do,
they can put pressure on the doctors.

01:10:18.039 --> 01:10:22.823
Because, as parents, we should
challenge these guys. We push them.

01:10:22.997 --> 01:10:29.913
Unless someone is willing to question,
to provoke, how would there be progress?

01:10:30.086 --> 01:10:32.043
Well, we feel there is progress.

01:10:32.173 --> 01:10:37.087
Loretta, we know that, but all we say is
start a dialectic with the doctors.

01:10:37.219 --> 01:10:39.088
Are you telling us what to do?

01:10:39.219 --> 01:10:41.567
We're asking you
to disseminate information.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:45.090
You gonna teach the doctors?
Where we come from, that's arrogance.

01:10:45.221 --> 01:10:47.569
- Arrogance!
- Yes.

01:10:47.699 --> 01:10:49.917
It is... arrogance.

01:10:50.656 --> 01:10:55.179
It comes from the Latin word... <i>arrogare.</i>

01:10:55.354 --> 01:10:58.311
You know it? You know
the root? What it means?

01:10:58.441 --> 01:11:02.051
It means to claim for oneself.

01:11:02.181 --> 01:11:06.312
That's the root.
It means to claim for oneself.

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:11.836
And I claim the right
to fight for my kid's life.

01:11:11.923 --> 01:11:17.663
And no doctor, no researcher, no bloody
foundation, has the right to stop me

01:11:17.794 --> 01:11:21.056
from asking questions
which might help me save him!

01:11:21.447 --> 01:11:25.753
And you have no right to stop
the sharing of information!

01:11:25.883 --> 01:11:29.145
- So you think about it!
- Our job is to be there for the parents.

01:11:29.275 --> 01:11:31.711
To comfort them,
not to get them stirred up.

01:11:31.841 --> 01:11:36.016
If the doctors think you have something,
they will tell us in their own good time.

01:11:36.104 --> 01:11:40.148
- Their own good time is not our time.
- What? They are so powerful...

01:11:40.235 --> 01:11:43.540
They are so powerful
that you would be silent?

01:11:43.671 --> 01:11:45.454
They are not gods!

01:11:45.628 --> 01:11:49.020
Do you know, this acquiescence
is so disgusting!

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:51.716
You think you know so much.
Let me tell <i>you</i> something!

01:11:51.803 --> 01:11:55.500
When Michael got sick, we looked for
anything that might help him.

01:11:55.631 --> 01:11:58.500
And the best thing that happened?
He was taken quickly.

01:11:58.631 --> 01:12:02.284
Now, Tommy... he has lasted three years.

01:12:02.414 --> 01:12:05.329
For two of 'em, he's been
without his sight, his mind,

01:12:05.459 --> 01:12:09.590
everything that makes him
a human being. He's a vegetable!

01:12:11.764 --> 01:12:16.722
Oh, boy! If you would stop all this denial,
you wouldn't do a thing

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:21.767
to prolong your boy's suffering
and indignity one minute longer.

01:12:30.161 --> 01:12:35.336
Has it occurred to you that maybe
he doesn't want to be around anymore?

01:12:36.946 --> 01:12:39.033
<i>Sì, sì</i>. Thank you.

01:12:47.556 --> 01:12:48.905
It has to be a mistake.

01:12:48.992 --> 01:12:52.167
No, Nikolais says not.

01:12:52.254 --> 01:12:54.515
- Augusto...
- Oh, sorry.

01:12:56.994 --> 01:13:00.430
- Should we risk raising the dose?
- No, he's too fragile.

01:13:00.604 --> 01:13:03.040
Any more might harm his liver.

01:13:28.002 --> 01:13:30.829
Lorenzo, listen to Mommy.

01:13:30.916 --> 01:13:33.917
You're going to have to be brave
as only you know how.

01:13:34.004 --> 01:13:36.613
We're gonna count together,
you and I, all right?

01:13:36.744 --> 01:13:40.223
Listen to Mommy's voice
and the boo-boo will let go of you.

01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:42.354
One, two,

01:13:43.049 --> 01:13:45.267
three, four...

01:14:06.012 --> 01:14:08.099
Michaela...

01:14:09.752 --> 01:14:15.015
You know, I've been a nurse for 18 years,
eight of them spent in ICU pediatrics.

01:14:15.145 --> 01:14:19.276
And I know that you can't always
play by the rules, but

01:14:19.407 --> 01:14:21.321
this boy shouldn't be at home.

01:14:21.451 --> 01:14:25.800
He should be placed
in a properly equipped hospital.

01:14:27.322 --> 01:14:29.583
Why don't you say what you mean?

01:14:29.714 --> 01:14:32.410
I'm not comfortable with this situation.

01:14:33.672 --> 01:14:38.630
Well, Lorenzo and I aren't comfortable
with your lack of comfort.

01:14:39.804 --> 01:14:42.674
I can't continue to be a party to this.

01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:46.892
I gotta give you my notice.
I'll stay until...

01:14:47.023 --> 01:14:49.807
- No, you should finish tonight.
- Michaela! Go easy.

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:53.850
Your agency will receive
a check in the morning.

01:14:53.982 --> 01:14:57.548
Look, Ruth. We're all
a little strung-out here.

01:14:57.678 --> 01:15:02.332
She's talking about placement, Deirdre.
It's a euphemism for "hospice."

01:15:02.505 --> 01:15:06.680
Lorenzo has enough to endure. We will
not expose ourself to doubt and despair.

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:09.507
She's exhausted. That's all it is.

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:13.769
Look, I don't know.
Somebody had to say something.

01:15:13.856 --> 01:15:15.943
Good luck.

01:16:11.219 --> 01:16:13.611
<i>Buonasera, Odone.</i>

01:16:13.698 --> 01:16:15.916
Look what I found.

01:16:16.046 --> 01:16:18.612
Look at this. Would you look at this!

01:16:20.569 --> 01:16:22.613
Let me show you.

01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:25.788
Where are we? Right here.

01:16:30.007 --> 01:16:33.573
That was June of '83, just 21 months ago.

01:16:40.575 --> 01:16:45.185
You know, it's time you guys
take it easy on yourselves.

01:16:45.271 --> 01:16:47.315
Deirdre...

01:16:48.707 --> 01:16:52.012
If we knew why it only work halfway,

01:16:53.839 --> 01:16:57.145
then we might know what to do next.

01:16:57.318 --> 01:17:01.711
Augusto, how many mornings
have I found you asleep

01:17:01.885 --> 01:17:05.407
under a pile of research papers
with the lights still on?

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:09.017
And then you wake up
and drag yourself into the office.

01:17:09.103 --> 01:17:11.104
How long can you keep this up?

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:14.452
If you get sick ‒ and you will -
what are you gonna do for money?

01:17:14.584 --> 01:17:18.193
What are you telling me?
For God's sake, he is my kid.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:24.282
Yeah, so are Cristina and Francesco, and
it's been a year since you've seen them.

01:17:24.455 --> 01:17:26.500
Listen to me, OK?

01:17:28.804 --> 01:17:32.328
There has to be a life beyond Lorenzo.

01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:36.633
What are you telling me?
That I should give up on this now?

01:17:36.763 --> 01:17:40.460
Oh, man. We both know that even if
you get his levels down to normal,

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:42.678
his brain can't fix itself.

01:17:42.808 --> 01:17:46.505
How much myelin does he have left?
Do you ever ask yourself that?

01:17:46.592 --> 01:17:50.984
- Deirdre, now that's enough.
- No. Don't bullshit me.

01:17:51.115 --> 01:17:54.637
I know you do... but she doesn't.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.204
Not ever.

01:17:59.334 --> 01:18:04.075
You have to help me with her.
She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep.

01:18:05.162 --> 01:18:08.250
I'm afraid for her.
I think she's losing it.

01:18:09.903 --> 01:18:14.120
You've seen how she is with him.
She just can't let him go.

01:18:14.251 --> 01:18:16.296
Poor Deirdre.

01:18:17.035 --> 01:18:20.513
Spoken as only a woman who's
never had a child could speak.

01:18:20.645 --> 01:18:23.602
Michaela, Deirdre was
speaking out of love.

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:26.211
I am only telling you what I see.

01:18:26.298 --> 01:18:30.343
For both your sakes,
there has to be life beyond Lorenzo.

01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:36.213
Do you think that he has no voice?
No will to live? He asserts it through us!

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:38.954
If you can't see that,
there's no place for you here!

01:18:39.084 --> 01:18:42.346
Michaela, for God's sake,
she is your sister!

01:18:42.476 --> 01:18:47.390
- And I think you're losing it, Michaela.
- Well, then, I think you should go.

01:18:48.738 --> 01:18:51.913
Augusto, help her pack her bags.
I'm going back to our son.

01:18:56.305 --> 01:18:58.785
You think I'm crazy
because I speak for our son?!

01:19:12.005 --> 01:19:15.355
I am so sorry.
I never wanted this to happen.

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:21.051
How can I? How can I enjoy
anything when he enjoys nothing?

01:19:21.182 --> 01:19:25.009
How can you talk to me about loving him
when you trivialize him into...

01:19:28.923 --> 01:19:30.967
No! No!

01:19:50.624 --> 01:19:53.016
- Mrs Odone!
- Get a tube.

01:19:53.147 --> 01:19:54.799
Do you have the tube?

01:19:54.973 --> 01:19:57.800
Don't nod, Nancy Jo. Say "yes."
My attention's on Lorenzo.

01:19:57.931 --> 01:20:01.410
Darling, look at me. Listen to
Mommy's voice. We're gonna count.

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:04.367
One, two, three, four...

01:20:22.372 --> 01:20:26.503
I'm sedating him as much as I dare.
I don't know what else to do.

01:20:37.115 --> 01:20:41.247
How can he endure this
for so many hours?

01:20:43.812 --> 01:20:45.857
Augusto...

01:20:46.813 --> 01:20:50.683
I don't think he'll have to
endure it much longer.

01:21:23.127 --> 01:21:26.519
Michaela, let me take him.

01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:29.041
- You need rest.
- I'm fine.

01:21:29.781 --> 01:21:32.216
I could use a cup of coffee, though.

01:21:41.436 --> 01:21:43.958
Lorenzo... Lorenzo, listen to Mama.

01:21:44.916 --> 01:21:47.046
Can you hear me, my darling?

01:21:47.176 --> 01:21:49.916
If this is too much for you,
my sweetheart,

01:21:50.003 --> 01:21:54.700
well then you fly, you fly
as fast as you can to baby Jesus.

01:21:57.571 --> 01:21:59.615
It's OK.

01:22:01.572 --> 01:22:03.834
Mama and Papa will be OK.

01:22:43.104 --> 01:22:46.801
I have rarely seen anything
like this boy's tenacity.

01:22:51.716 --> 01:22:54.194
They have a bed available upstairs.

01:22:54.325 --> 01:22:56.760
No, no, no. In a hospice, no.

01:22:57.674 --> 01:22:59.674
It'd be easier. On everybody.

01:22:59.761 --> 01:23:02.631
But I would not do honor to Lorenzo.

01:23:21.462 --> 01:23:23.550
Michaela. Come.

01:23:23.724 --> 01:23:26.202
- What?
- Come. Come on.

01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:28.377
- Nurse.
- Yes.

01:23:38.206 --> 01:23:42.120
Now, today we eat, <i>moglie mia,</i>
every last mouthful.

01:23:42.293 --> 01:23:44.512
- I'm not hungry.
- No, no, no. You eat.

01:23:44.599 --> 01:23:45.643
Sit.

01:23:45.817 --> 01:23:48.904
Michaela, you sit. Sit.

01:23:49.035 --> 01:23:53.470
From tomorrow morning,
the Odones need all their energies.

01:23:53.602 --> 01:23:58.168
Now listen. We set out to
normalize Lorenzo's blood, right?

01:23:58.254 --> 01:24:04.256
And with the oleic oil, we got it
half-right, but that was luck.

01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:09.388
- It was rather more than luck.
- No, it was luck. Merely observation.

01:24:09.475 --> 01:24:12.520
Rizzo observed something
in a test tube, right?

01:24:12.606 --> 01:24:14.824
We tried it on Lorenzo.

01:24:14.911 --> 01:24:18.303
Rizzo observed
a 50 per cent drop in fibroblasts.

01:24:18.434 --> 01:24:21.521
We observed
a 50 per cent drop in Lorenzo.

01:24:22.957 --> 01:24:27.175
Michaela, that is luck.
That is observation.

01:24:27.349 --> 01:24:31.612
That is all it is.
It is not understanding.

01:24:31.742 --> 01:24:35.220
And until we understand
why this work only halfway,

01:24:35.352 --> 01:24:39.309
how can we expect
to succeed all the way?

01:24:39.439 --> 01:24:44.006
I need to understand, Michaela.
<i>You</i> need to understand.

01:24:44.962 --> 01:24:48.137
So, tomorrow we go back to the library.

01:24:48.877 --> 01:24:53.921
No, no, no. We review all the literature,
everything on fatty-acid metabolism,

01:24:54.052 --> 01:24:56.618
every word published in the last decade.

01:24:56.748 --> 01:24:59.054
So, eat. You eat.

01:24:59.184 --> 01:25:02.489
Whatever energy or time I have left
I want to spend with Lorenzo.

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:05.316
You will not have to leave him.
I will go to the library.

01:25:05.446 --> 01:25:07.838
I make copies for you,
I bring it home for you.

01:25:07.925 --> 01:25:11.709
Augusto, we are on our second mortgage.
You can't afford not to go to work.

01:25:11.839 --> 01:25:15.362
Michaela, I will work.
I'll fit it in somehow.

01:25:16.623 --> 01:25:20.580
Michaela, this is important. I need you.

01:25:23.190 --> 01:25:25.234
I need you, Michaela.

01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:28.713
So eat.

01:25:47.805 --> 01:25:51.197
<i>Brava! Bravissima! Bravissima!</i>

01:26:13.333 --> 01:26:15.421
Betty! Betty!

01:26:16.334 --> 01:26:20.597
All these fatty-acid studies concentrate
on the middle of the chain

01:26:20.727 --> 01:26:24.510
because the medium-chain saturates
are implicated in cholesterol.

01:26:24.641 --> 01:26:28.207
So what do these researchers do?
Think cholesterol, cholesterol.

01:26:28.294 --> 01:26:31.469
C12. C14, C-bloody-16!

01:26:31.599 --> 01:26:34.905
- Augusto, what are you looking for?
- I am looking

01:26:35.079 --> 01:26:39.384
- for the long end of fatty-acid chains!
- All right. Write it down for me.

01:26:39.514 --> 01:26:42.689
These researchers should be
doing something about this.

01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:45.124
- Write it down.
- Long-chain fatty acids.

01:26:45.298 --> 01:26:49.039
C18 through C26.

01:26:49.691 --> 01:26:51.517
Saturated.

01:26:51.605 --> 01:26:54.039
Monounsaturated, OK?

01:26:54.171 --> 01:26:57.302
OK. Now I want you to go off to lunch.

01:26:57.432 --> 01:27:01.564
Have yourself a good lunch
and I'm gonna see what I can do.

01:27:12.131 --> 01:27:14.393
This is the best I could do
at short notice.

01:27:14.567 --> 01:27:18.133
One article from a veterinary
science journal about pigs.

01:27:18.264 --> 01:27:22.525
- But it's on your long-chain fats.
- Well, thank you, Betty.

01:27:22.657 --> 01:27:25.656
Listen, I am very sorry about...

01:27:25.788 --> 01:27:28.657
Oh, well, you're Italian.

01:27:32.658 --> 01:27:37.225
..72, 73, 74...

01:27:37.356 --> 01:27:41.531
That's it. 75, 76,

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.836
77, 78...

01:27:46.358 --> 01:27:48.619
Nice going, Mrs Odone.

01:27:49.663 --> 01:27:53.707
That's it, my love. You know
only the strongest, bravest boy,

01:27:53.838 --> 01:27:57.578
only a very special person
like you is chosen to fight the boo-boo.

01:27:57.708 --> 01:28:00.318
I'll give him a little water, OK? 20cc's?

01:28:00.448 --> 01:28:01.492
Yes.

01:28:01.623 --> 01:28:06.755
And, Nancy Jo, why don't you tell Lorenzo
what an excellent job he did?

01:28:06.929 --> 01:28:09.277
An excellent job you did, Lorenzo.

01:28:09.407 --> 01:28:14.800
Sometimes I wonder, my love, if people
realize how incredible you truly are.

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:27.021
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

01:28:28.499 --> 01:28:30.891
Is this a new hobby or a nervous tic?

01:28:33.544 --> 01:28:36.980
No, this is a simple mind at work,
that's all.

01:28:37.066 --> 01:28:41.459
See, each paper clip, Deirdre,
is two carbon atom, right?

01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:43.286
- Oh, God!
- No, no, no.

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.808
Really is two carbon atom, all right?

01:28:45.939 --> 01:28:49.723
So we have C2, C4, C6, you know?

01:28:49.853 --> 01:28:52.897
Now, here's what I try to do.
I try to make a chain,

01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:56.985
a very long chain
of monounsaturated fats.

01:28:57.072 --> 01:29:00.725
- This is the good guys, right?
- OK, what are these? The bad guys?

01:29:00.856 --> 01:29:03.378
Yes. These here

01:29:03.508 --> 01:29:06.161
is the bad guys, all right?

01:29:06.249 --> 01:29:08.379
Now, Deirdre, what I'm trying to do...

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:10.945
I try to understand the relationship

01:29:11.075 --> 01:29:14.120
between the good guys
and the bad guys.

01:29:14.468 --> 01:29:17.425
So, OK, I am the enzyme, right?

01:29:17.556 --> 01:29:22.949
And I reach out and grab a carbon atom
and I put it on my chain, right?

01:29:23.123 --> 01:29:24.601
Here is my chain.

01:29:24.688 --> 01:29:27.471
Now, here, you be
the bad-guy enzyme, OK?

01:29:27.602 --> 01:29:31.341
No, no. Do this for me.
You be bad-guy enzyme, all right?

01:29:31.473 --> 01:29:32.994
Take this, all right?

01:29:33.126 --> 01:29:38.344
Now you reach out and grab a carbon
atom and put it on your bad-guy chain.

01:29:38.431 --> 01:29:40.909
I had enough trouble
with the kitchen sink.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.867
No, no. You just do this and
then I explain, OK? All right.

01:29:45.954 --> 01:29:51.695
So let's each start now
making our chains.

01:29:51.825 --> 01:29:56.349
OK? All right? Do another one.
That's good, Deirdre.

01:29:56.435 --> 01:29:58.567
Good. We put another one on...

01:29:58.697 --> 01:30:02.567
- Here's the stuff on enzyme complexes.
- Ah, thank you. <i>Mille grazie.</i>

01:30:02.654 --> 01:30:04.611
<i>- Prego.
- Prego!</i> Very good.

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:07.177
- Now, did you make the extra copies?
- Oh, you bet.

01:30:07.308 --> 01:30:09.743
- Thank you very much.
- For Michaela? How is she?

01:30:09.918 --> 01:30:11.352
She's fine.

01:30:11.483 --> 01:30:16.136
So here we are. We're making our chains
more or less the same rate, right?

01:30:16.223 --> 01:30:18.442
That's as one would expect, right?

01:30:18.572 --> 01:30:21.877
But, now, Deirdre, if we were enzymes

01:30:22.008 --> 01:30:25.617
in the bodies of little rats
and little pigs and Lorenzo,

01:30:25.748 --> 01:30:29.705
then the faster I go,
the more you slow down.

01:30:30.532 --> 01:30:32.880
Now, why would that be?

01:30:33.054 --> 01:30:38.751
Why, the faster I go, would you slow
down, if we are both separate enzymes?

01:30:38.925 --> 01:30:43.796
It means that there has to be
some kind of relationship going on.

01:30:43.927 --> 01:30:48.318
We affect each other some way.
There's some kind of interplay.

01:30:48.493 --> 01:30:51.102
But what is it?

01:30:51.233 --> 01:30:53.277
What is it?

01:30:56.799 --> 01:30:58.844
One, two,

01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:02.018
three, four,

01:31:02.888 --> 01:31:05.584
five, six,

01:31:06.106 --> 01:31:07.802
seven candles.

01:31:07.933 --> 01:31:10.760
And Mommy will blow them out for you.

01:31:10.890 --> 01:31:12.934
Make a wish.

01:31:53.423 --> 01:31:56.293
Michaela! They are the same enzyme!

01:31:56.380 --> 01:32:01.511
There is one enzyme for both chains.
It's the same bloody enzyme!

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:05.209
So if we keep the enzyme busy
making monounsaturates...

01:32:05.339 --> 01:32:07.904
It distracts it from
elongating the saturates.

01:32:08.036 --> 01:32:10.732
Right! So we have a way to trick nature.

01:32:10.819 --> 01:32:13.950
Yes, it's a principle called
"competitive inhibition."

01:32:14.124 --> 01:32:17.386
So, Gus, do you think
it's a reasonable hypothesis?

01:32:17.472 --> 01:32:21.909
I think it's more. You've clarified
the biochemical pathway.

01:32:22.039 --> 01:32:24.822
Augusto, I really want
to congratulate you.

01:32:24.953 --> 01:32:29.388
This would explain why oleic acid
is only partly successful.

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:33.346
Yes, it's C18, you see.
It's too low down in the chain.

01:32:33.477 --> 01:32:37.912
So we add a second barrier. We block
the bad guys further up the chain,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.305
the saturates further up the chain,
between C22 and C24.

01:32:42.479 --> 01:32:44.654
There we stop
the bloody things completely.

01:32:44.784 --> 01:32:48.568
- And how would you do that?
- By adding monounsaturated C22.

01:32:48.742 --> 01:32:51.481
- That's erucic acid.
- Yes, exactly.

01:32:52.178 --> 01:32:54.265
Erm...

01:32:54.396 --> 01:32:56.221
- Martha?
<i>- Yes, Doctor?</i>

01:32:56.353 --> 01:33:01.614
Among our animal studies,
you will find a file on erucic acid.

01:33:01.745 --> 01:33:04.571
With an e... r-u-c-i-c.

01:33:04.703 --> 01:33:06.746
<i>- OK.</i>
- Thank you.

01:33:07.616 --> 01:33:10.269
You don't believe it will work?

01:33:10.356 --> 01:33:15.748
I think what you have done is postulate a
theory that could be of enormous benefit.

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:20.489
But, as for erucic acid,
it creates cardiac problems in rats.

01:33:21.271 --> 01:33:25.099
If it's not safe for rats, I don't know
what justification there can be

01:33:25.273 --> 01:33:29.230
for using it as a therapy on humans.

01:33:29.317 --> 01:33:31.144
But Gus, Gus,

01:33:31.318 --> 01:33:35.276
erucic acid is the chief component
in rapeseed oil, right?

01:33:35.363 --> 01:33:38.929
Rapeseed oil is a common food
in China and India.

01:33:39.059 --> 01:33:42.060
And their rate of heart disease
is far lower than here.

01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:45.974
All right, look at these documents.
Cardiac lipidosis,

01:33:46.148 --> 01:33:50.410
myocardial lesions, cholesterol
deposits in the adrenal gland

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:53.541
and damage to the reproductive system.

01:33:53.671 --> 01:33:57.412
I'm afraid the weight of evidence
is much too great.

01:33:57.542 --> 01:34:00.152
And no human-studies
review committee

01:34:00.238 --> 01:34:04.544
will ever do anything but discard
erucic acid out of hand.

01:34:04.631 --> 01:34:09.067
But the human studies
have been accomplished by history.

01:34:09.154 --> 01:34:13.677
They have been eating the stuff
in these countries for thousands of years.

01:34:13.807 --> 01:34:17.722
You can't expect me to start a protocol
based on that kind of assertion.

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:20.114
You should examine your protocol

01:34:20.244 --> 01:34:23.940
when children are dying and
find a way to research these...

01:34:24.071 --> 01:34:28.072
- It's common sense.
- We simply have a contradiction.

01:34:28.159 --> 01:34:32.116
We seek more information. We do not
dismiss erucic acid out of hand.

01:34:32.247 --> 01:34:36.726
Michaela, if I ignore all this evidence

01:34:36.857 --> 01:34:40.684
and we embark on a therapy
based on erucic acid...

01:34:42.423 --> 01:34:45.468
Something goes wrong. What then?

01:34:46.033 --> 01:34:50.513
Well, then I suppose the risk-reward
ratio is too unattractive for you.

01:34:51.208 --> 01:34:53.253
I beg your pardon?

01:34:54.427 --> 01:34:57.949
The life of one boy
is not enough reward for you

01:34:58.036 --> 01:35:03.342
to risk the reputation of the institution
and the esteem of your peers.

01:35:04.951 --> 01:35:10.648
That was uncalled for. Your responsibility
is merely towards your own child.

01:35:10.735 --> 01:35:15.780
My responsibility is towards all the boys
that suffer from this disease,

01:35:15.911 --> 01:35:18.085
now and in the future.

01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:22.739
Of course I anguish for
the suffering of your boy.

01:35:23.565 --> 01:35:28.218
And of course I applaud you for
the efforts you make on his behalf.

01:35:29.088 --> 01:35:32.176
But I will have nothing to do
with this oil.

01:35:33.307 --> 01:35:38.482
We are not asking, Doctor,
for your anguish or your applause.

01:35:38.569 --> 01:35:41.657
We are asking merely for a little courage.

01:35:46.875 --> 01:35:48.919
OK. All right.

01:35:53.921 --> 01:35:59.661
No, whatever the doctors say,
reason tells us it is a risk worth taking.

01:35:59.749 --> 01:36:04.054
But, my friend, we need
a sympathetic collaborator, hm?

01:36:04.141 --> 01:36:07.664
If it was in my hands, I would do
anything I could to help, Mr Odone.

01:36:07.794 --> 01:36:09.838
I have a boy of my own.

01:36:10.707 --> 01:36:12.751
But I don't like our chances.

01:36:12.839 --> 01:36:17.753
You know, they said the same thing
about the oleic acid, and here it was,

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:21.624
- sitting right on the shelf.
- This is a whole other ball game.

01:36:21.754 --> 01:36:25.885
Extracting the saturated C24 and 26
from rapeseed oil...

01:36:26.016 --> 01:36:29.278
It's very tricky. It would take
our best chemist at least a year.

01:36:29.365 --> 01:36:35.062
And then you would never get it past the
FDA. Erucic acid for human consumption?

01:36:35.192 --> 01:36:39.367
I'm sorry, but no one in the country
is gonna touch it.

01:36:39.542 --> 01:36:42.890
Well, what about
outside this country, hm?

01:36:43.064 --> 01:36:45.151
Uh, I wouldn't know where to send you.

01:36:45.282 --> 01:36:50.196
Oh, Mr Pellerman! We're agents
for over a dozen foreign companies.

01:36:50.370 --> 01:36:52.283
There must be one that could help.

01:36:52.458 --> 01:36:55.719
Maybe all we need to do is look
at the list of the foreign companies.

01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:58.894
No, you and your wife
have enough to do.

01:36:58.981 --> 01:37:03.722
I'm sure Mr Pellerman would be happy
to make the calls for you.

01:37:07.809 --> 01:37:09.636
We'd have to be covered, legally.

01:37:09.767 --> 01:37:14.159
If anything goes wrong, this company
is not going to be held liable.

01:37:14.290 --> 01:37:17.508
Oh, we would not hold you liable. No, no.

01:37:17.638 --> 01:37:23.640
And this... It would be greatly
appreciated if we could circulate this.

01:37:28.336 --> 01:37:33.294
"The interplay of monounsaturated
and saturated fatty acids:

01:37:33.425 --> 01:37:36.600
Therapeutic application in ALD."

01:37:36.730 --> 01:37:38.252
- Wow.
- You wrote this?

01:37:38.383 --> 01:37:41.993
Yes. We felt that
if we were asking for help,

01:37:42.167 --> 01:37:45.472
our rationale needs to be very clear.

01:37:45.602 --> 01:37:51.256
<i>We've all read your paper.
It's a beautiful piece of biochemistry.</i>

01:37:51.386 --> 01:37:54.648
<i>Over a hundred companies
all say "too difficult."</i>

01:37:54.734 --> 01:37:58.344
Well, my first impression
was that it's bloody impossible.

01:37:58.475 --> 01:38:02.345
But I've been doing difficult
fractionations for 40 years

01:38:02.433 --> 01:38:06.173
- and I'd like to have a stab at it.
<i>- How long do you think, Mr Suddaby?</i>

01:38:06.347 --> 01:38:10.174
I've only six months
before I retire, so we'll see.

01:38:10.348 --> 01:38:15.523
<i>All right. Then I'll let you get on with it.
Call me if you have any questions.</i>

01:38:15.609 --> 01:38:17.697
Righto. Bye, then.

01:38:40.008 --> 01:38:42.052
Who could this be?

01:38:45.836 --> 01:38:48.140
Ah, your good friend Wendy

01:38:48.314 --> 01:38:52.098
with all sorts of lovely
vegetables and fruits.

01:38:52.837 --> 01:38:54.881
- Hi, Michaela.
- Look what you brought us!

01:38:55.011 --> 01:38:56.925
Hi, Lorenzo.

01:38:57.055 --> 01:38:59.056
Jake's not in school today?

01:38:59.186 --> 01:39:01.230
He's not feeling so good.

01:39:03.622 --> 01:39:08.015
I'm going for a walk with Mrs Gimble
and we shall be back shortly.

01:39:08.145 --> 01:39:11.581
I've given him his oxcarbazepine
and 15ml of water.

01:39:12.451 --> 01:39:16.495
- Do you want me to do anything else?
- I'm sure he would love a story.

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:19.061
Do you have a problem with this?

01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:23.453
Fine.

01:39:29.890 --> 01:39:33.674
- He's had a couple of tantrums.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:39:33.804 --> 01:39:35.848
It's OK.

01:39:36.718 --> 01:39:40.850
- Dr Rizzo got him in the oleic acid trial.
- That's good.

01:39:46.199 --> 01:39:48.243
Hi, Jake.

01:39:49.721 --> 01:39:52.896
Hi, sweetie.
Thank you for my potatoes.

01:39:55.288 --> 01:39:57.376
Say hello, son.

01:40:00.159 --> 01:40:05.812
Hi, Mrs Odone.

01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:18.337
He saw the way Jaybird went.

01:40:19.208 --> 01:40:21.687
He knows what's in store for him.

01:40:27.775 --> 01:40:30.602
"They forgot their hunger
and followed the bird."

01:40:30.732 --> 01:40:32.777
"They came to an opening in the forest."

01:40:32.907 --> 01:40:37.299
"Before them was a little cottage,
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun."

01:40:37.387 --> 01:40:41.388
"'Look, Gretel' exclaimed Hansel.
'That cottage is made of gingerbread.'"

01:40:41.518 --> 01:40:44.866
"'It really is' replied Gretel,
running up and tasting a bit

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.954
that she had pulled from the wall."

01:40:47.128 --> 01:40:49.650
"'And the roof is shingled
with butterscotch.'"

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:53.869
"'The windowsills are made of chocolate'
declared Hansel, breaking off a bit."

01:40:53.999 --> 01:40:57.609
"'The windowpanes are clear candy'
said Gretel. At that moment..."

01:40:57.739 --> 01:41:01.349
Nancy Jo, do you think you could muster
just a tad more enthusiasm?

01:41:01.523 --> 01:41:04.480
Lorenzo loves words.
He loves the sound of language.

01:41:04.611 --> 01:41:08.003
Well, I'm paid to nurse,
not read stories.

01:41:08.872 --> 01:41:12.352
You've decided his mind doesn't need
as much nurturing as his body?

01:41:12.482 --> 01:41:14.527
What mind?

01:41:15.135 --> 01:41:17.180
I beg your pardon!

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.789
Nothing.

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:23.007
Get out.

01:41:23.138 --> 01:41:25.704
- Look, Mrs Odone...
- Just get out.

01:41:25.834 --> 01:41:29.270
I've read up on this disease!
I know what it's done to his brain!

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:33.183
Sh! Lorenzo doesn't need this from
a subliterate with a double-digit IQ!

01:41:33.271 --> 01:41:35.793
Face it. The lights are out
and nobody's home!

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:38.446
- Just get out. Go!
- Well, merry Christmas.

01:41:38.533 --> 01:41:40.794
- Get out!
- Happy holidays!

01:41:41.621 --> 01:41:43.664
And a joyous yuletide!

01:41:51.623 --> 01:41:54.102
"Near a great forest
lived a poor woodcutter

01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:57.364
with his two children,
Hansel and Gretel."

01:41:57.494 --> 01:42:00.973
"Times were very hard and
a day came when there was no food,

01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:03.235
except a little stale bread."

01:42:03.322 --> 01:42:06.845
"But Hansel..." was like you, my darling.

01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:13.933
"He was a clever lad who knew
how to solve difficult problems."

01:42:15.672 --> 01:42:18.369
"The woodcutter was very sad..."

01:42:19.326 --> 01:42:21.935
Are you going to
keep doing this?

01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:26.284
She brought it on herself. She
consigned herself to the outer darkness.

01:42:26.458 --> 01:42:31.024
Michaela, Nancy Jo, she was
a good nurse. You train her well.

01:42:31.156 --> 01:42:34.113
Yes, but I want someone
to give him more than medication.

01:42:34.243 --> 01:42:37.809
Someone who will minister
to his mind and his soul.

01:42:38.809 --> 01:42:41.027
- I think I've found him.
- What?

01:42:42.332 --> 01:42:45.550
I wrote to Omouri.
I asked him to come and stay with us.

01:42:45.681 --> 01:42:46.681
- Omouri?
- Yes.

01:42:46.812 --> 01:42:50.943
Lorenzo is surrounded by women all day.
I don't want him to grow up hag-ridden.

01:42:51.073 --> 01:42:54.205
But you cannot take a boy
out of his fishing village

01:42:54.291 --> 01:42:56.379
and bring him here to nurse Lorenzo.

01:42:56.553 --> 01:43:00.249
Not to nurse him, to be his friend.
To bring the Comoros into this room.

01:43:00.381 --> 01:43:06.599
We cannot uproot this young man
from his family, his way of life.

01:43:07.687 --> 01:43:10.774
- Where will he live?
- Here, in Lorenzo's room.

01:43:10.905 --> 01:43:13.992
But... he has no English.

01:43:14.862 --> 01:43:17.863
He's a Muslim. An African.

01:43:17.993 --> 01:43:23.474
We cannot bring an African to this racist
country to be a second-class citizen.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.561
- This is Washington, DC.
- He'll be part of this family.

01:43:26.648 --> 01:43:29.518
I'll teach him English.
There's a lot we can do for him.

01:43:29.606 --> 01:43:31.693
Oh, Michaela...

01:43:32.258 --> 01:43:34.302
Here. Sit down, sit down.

01:43:35.955 --> 01:43:40.652
Now, the last time
Omouri saw Lorenzo,

01:43:40.783 --> 01:43:42.826
he was climbing trees.

01:43:42.957 --> 01:43:46.566
He was a wild and vibrant boy,
full of life.

01:43:50.133 --> 01:43:53.046
In the letter that you wrote to Omouri,

01:43:54.177 --> 01:43:59.135
did you tell him what he will see
when he walks into this room?

01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:05.615
I told him he'd see a young man who
was very ill and had need of a friend.

01:44:06.442 --> 01:44:08.050
That is all?

01:44:08.181 --> 01:44:11.833
How would you have me describe him?
As a biochemical conundrum?

01:44:11.965 --> 01:44:14.008
<i>Non è vero.</i>

01:44:14.878 --> 01:44:17.966
You know he is not that for me.

01:44:19.618 --> 01:44:23.315
Augusto, when you look at him,
what do you see?

01:44:25.968 --> 01:44:28.403
Tell me the truth.

01:46:02.385 --> 01:46:05.646
- How do I tell the man to give up?
- Say his health won't take it.

01:46:05.777 --> 01:46:09.647
The hours he's working are daft.
Our expectations were unrealistic.

01:46:09.821 --> 01:46:14.301
Look, Don's a man who's been working all
of his life in face creams and cosmetics.

01:46:14.431 --> 01:46:17.997
With this oil, he's having the time
of his life. <i>You</i> tell him. I won't.

01:46:18.085 --> 01:46:20.477
All right. For his own sake, I'll have to.

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:25.261
Then you can call Mrs Odone and
tell her that you've pulled the plug.

01:46:27.956 --> 01:46:31.261
- I'd best leave him be.
- I think you're right.

01:46:43.221 --> 01:46:45.265
Omouri!

01:47:31.712 --> 01:47:35.018
Lorenzo... Omouri is here.

01:48:41.774 --> 01:48:45.080
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr Suddaby.

01:48:45.166 --> 01:48:49.298
There's a bottle of pure erucic acid
triglyceride on my bench.

01:48:49.429 --> 01:48:53.473
Will you see that it gets to young
Mr Odone as soon as possible, please?

01:48:54.125 --> 01:48:56.169
I'm off home now. Bye-bye.

01:48:57.126 --> 01:48:58.865
Goodbye, Mr Suddaby.

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:05.432
Well, we'd better get on with it.

01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:17.653
Four parts our old friend, the oleic.

01:49:19.089 --> 01:49:24.872
And one part erucic.

01:49:26.656 --> 01:49:30.352
And the journey begins,
and like all good journeys,

01:49:30.482 --> 01:49:33.136
with food.

01:49:35.658 --> 01:49:37.919
Where's the wretched nurse?

01:49:38.050 --> 01:49:41.921
I'm gonna take my baseline myself
if she doesn't get here soon.

01:49:42.051 --> 01:49:45.834
A month is much too long.
If we check my blood every week

01:49:45.965 --> 01:49:51.445
and I have a cardiogram, we should
know enough to start Lorenzo sooner.

01:49:51.575 --> 01:49:53.837
Oh, at last!

01:50:02.230 --> 01:50:04.056
Hi.

01:50:04.144 --> 01:50:05.970
How's the mother tiger?

01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:11.537
Augusto didn't tell you?
I'm here to be Lorenzo's rat.

01:50:13.755 --> 01:50:16.451
That's a very kind offer,
but I can't let you.

01:50:16.581 --> 01:50:20.496
I'm a carrier, just like you. My blood
levels are just as high as yours.

01:50:20.626 --> 01:50:24.540
I've had my baseline taken...
and I'm starving.

01:50:26.193 --> 01:50:29.933
Oh, I have been wanting
to meet Lorenzo's main man.

01:50:31.194 --> 01:50:33.542
I am content to
greet Aunt Deirdre.

01:50:33.716 --> 01:50:36.326
Well, it's good to meet you too.

01:50:36.457 --> 01:50:41.153
Now, now, Michaela. I want no argument.
Michaela, you cannot test it.

01:50:41.241 --> 01:50:45.416
- Lorenzo needs you fit and well.
- So you would put Deirdre at risk

01:50:45.546 --> 01:50:50.025
- without even discussing...
- Hey! I backpacked all through India.

01:50:50.156 --> 01:50:53.200
I must have eaten
rapeseed oil up the wazoo.

01:50:53.331 --> 01:50:56.853
- Ah, I've been fasting all day.
- All right, go ahead. Try it.

01:50:56.941 --> 01:50:58.984
OK, here goes.

01:51:02.767 --> 01:51:05.159
So... does it taste awful?

01:51:06.073 --> 01:51:08.204
- No? Good.
- It's good.

01:51:08.334 --> 01:51:10.770
Good. Eat, eat.

<i>Your sister had
no side effects?</i>

01:51:17.946 --> 01:51:22.382
None at all. If we can normalize the
levels of a carrier so quickly, who knows?

01:51:22.556 --> 01:51:25.599
- We'll start Lorenzo immediately.
<i>- Marvelous.</i>

01:51:25.730 --> 01:51:27.731

<i>- No, no.</i>

<i>- What dosage will you give the lad?</i>
- We don't have time to be conservative.

01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:39.125

Well, we told him and the other doctors
and we sent all the figures.

01:55:07.441 --> 01:55:11.703
- What did they have to say?
- They deliberate. They want more study.

01:55:11.833 --> 01:55:15.138
- Wendy, that's enough.
- So the other kids have to wait?

01:55:15.269 --> 01:55:17.443
We know what to do
about that, don't we?

01:55:17.617 --> 01:55:20.792
The doctors had a very hard time
swallowing the first oil.

01:55:20.922 --> 01:55:24.402

- No.

01:55:27.011 --> 01:55:30.316
So we leave science

01:55:32.055 --> 01:55:34.491
- Merry Christmas.
- Goodbye, Jake.

01:56:09.413 --> 01:56:12.154

01:56:12.284 --> 01:56:16.241

an announcement quite soon

about a new development
in our diet therapy.

01:56:44.901 --> 01:56:48.032
It's expensive but,
with the help of the government

01:56:48.163 --> 01:56:50.815
and of this wonderful foundation,

01:56:50.946 --> 01:56:55.513
we are going to start a trial
before the end of the year.

01:57:04.602 --> 01:57:08.080
I can hear from that
that you wish us Godspeed.

01:57:19.389 --> 01:57:21.172
Excuse me, Doctor!

01:57:21.302 --> 01:57:24.694
Are you referring to the oil
the Odones have invented for Lorenzo?

01:57:24.781 --> 01:57:27.869
- We'll take questions later.
- No, it's a good question.

01:57:27.956 --> 01:57:32.391
I should have mentioned it perhaps but...
The Odones have been extremely active

01:57:32.523 --> 01:57:34.523
and we are in their debt.

01:57:34.653 --> 01:57:37.306
Thanks to them,
we are preparing a protocol

01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:40.655
for review by
the human-studies committee.

01:57:40.785 --> 01:57:44.047
If then we can persuade
the government to fund us,

01:57:44.177 --> 01:57:49.918
then we shall know if this oil is of
more than temporary therapeutic value.

01:57:50.005 --> 01:57:53.310
But it works! Lorenzo's
blood levels are down to normal.

01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:57.833
It's precisely for that reason
that we are conducting this trial.

01:57:57.964 --> 01:58:00.268
You don't expect me
to endorse a therapy

01:58:00.442 --> 01:58:03.573
just on the basis
of one hopeful observation?

01:58:03.748 --> 01:58:06.966
There's two! My boy's been
takin' the oil for six months.

01:58:07.097 --> 01:58:10.358
Yes, Ellard, and his blood levels
are down to normal. He's fine.

01:58:10.489 --> 01:58:12.402
You are playing with people's hopes.

01:58:12.532 --> 01:58:17.751
Where do these Odones get off, thinking
they know more than the doctors?

01:58:17.839 --> 01:58:21.275
- Where did you get this oil?
- The Odones. They get it from England.

01:58:21.405 --> 01:58:25.666
They don't have approval from the FDA.
It's bootleg. Give the doctors a chance...

01:58:25.797 --> 01:58:28.581
Come on, Ellard!
It's a mixture of two cooking oils.

01:58:28.711 --> 01:58:33.016
Two cooking oils? What's the dosage,
please? What are the side effects of this?

01:58:33.147 --> 01:58:36.192
- How would we pay for it?
- There must be a formal protocol

01:58:36.322 --> 01:58:40.974
before we can raise funds. I understand
it will cost over $1,000 a liter.

01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:47.020
And no insurance company or government
will support you without the approval.

01:58:47.194 --> 01:58:50.282
And the only way to get it
is through thorough testing.

01:58:50.368 --> 01:58:54.022
That's what they told AIDS people
about AZT, but they fought and got it.

01:58:54.152 --> 01:58:57.806
Because they were dying.
They didn't have time to wait...

01:58:57.936 --> 01:59:01.242
We padded our walls yesterday!
I want that oil!

01:59:11.679 --> 01:59:15.375
There, my darling. That's a sweet boy.

01:59:17.333 --> 01:59:19.376
What a big, strong boy.

01:59:20.246 --> 01:59:22.725
Yes, my darling. Yes.

01:59:55.517 --> 01:59:57.126
You see, Michaela,

01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:01.648
it's as though he is trapped
down in some dark cave.

02:00:03.170 --> 02:00:08.433
Because he's lost so much myelin,
he can't find his way out.

02:00:08.563 --> 02:00:12.347
Now, we know
his simple functions are intact.

02:00:12.477 --> 02:00:16.260
He breathes, he swallows,
his heart beats.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:21.958
And from the outside world,
he receives sensation.

02:00:22.045 --> 02:00:24.133
A touch,

02:00:25.742 --> 02:00:27.785
pain, cold.

02:00:28.481 --> 02:00:31.786
And here are the primal feelings.

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:35.092
Fear, hunger, desire.

02:00:36.658 --> 02:00:42.354
While up here in the neocortex,
the higher brain, locked here,

02:00:42.486 --> 02:00:46.791
are his reasoning,
imagination, memory.

02:00:47.965 --> 02:00:50.792
The things that make us each ourselves.

02:00:55.967 --> 02:00:58.054
So how does he reach us?

02:01:01.055 --> 02:01:04.361
When a simple swallow
is such a huge task?

02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:10.014
To find...

02:01:10.623 --> 02:01:14.624
To find the way,
the path from his mind

02:01:16.493 --> 02:01:18.538
to the outside world

02:01:20.626 --> 02:01:24.148
is like willing himself
through a brick wall.

02:01:26.410 --> 02:01:28.497
So he waits, huh?

02:01:33.586 --> 02:01:35.629
He waits.

02:01:37.935 --> 02:01:39.978
Michaela...

02:01:45.371 --> 02:01:52.286
Do you ever think that

02:01:53.808 --> 02:01:56.895
maybe all this struggle,

02:01:59.070 --> 02:02:02.767
it may have been for
somebody else's kid?

02:02:21.642 --> 02:02:23.686
Yes.

02:02:54.259 --> 02:02:57.086
But I promised... I promised him

02:02:57.869 --> 02:03:00.347
his world would never be silent.

02:03:02.261 --> 02:03:04.348
He would never be alone.

02:03:05.871 --> 02:03:07.697
Yes.

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:13.351
"One morning,
a little rabbit sat on a bank."

02:03:13.525 --> 02:03:17.873
"He pricked his ears and listened
to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony."

02:03:17.961 --> 02:03:21.613
"A gig was coming along the road.
It was driven by Mr McGregor."

02:03:21.744 --> 02:03:25.223
"And beside him sat Mrs McGregor
in her best bonnet."

02:03:25.354 --> 02:03:29.138
"As soon as they had passed, little
Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road

02:03:29.224 --> 02:03:33.356
and set off with a hop, skip and a jump
to call upon his relations,

02:03:33.443 --> 02:03:37.183
who lived in the woods
at the back of Mr McGregor's garden."

02:03:37.313 --> 02:03:41.923
"That wood was full of rabbit holes,
and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all

02:03:42.011 --> 02:03:47.142
lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins,
Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter."

02:03:47.272 --> 02:03:50.622
"Old Mrs Rabbit was a widow. She..."

02:03:50.752 --> 02:03:54.318
"..earned her living by knitting
rabbit-wool mittens and muffeties."

02:03:54.448 --> 02:03:56.536
"I once bought a pair..."

02:03:58.014 --> 02:04:01.102
What's the matter, darling?
You don't like the story?

02:04:08.713 --> 02:04:10.583
Lorenzo...

02:04:12.583 --> 02:04:14.280
You don't like the story?

02:04:17.063 --> 02:04:19.064
He does that a lot lately.

02:04:19.150 --> 02:04:21.369
- When?
- Mainly at story time.

02:04:22.630 --> 02:04:24.673
Sweetheart...

02:04:25.152 --> 02:04:27.196
Listen carefully to Mama.

02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:31.980
Is your middle name Patrick?

02:04:35.982 --> 02:04:39.156
No... Is it Peter?

02:04:42.417 --> 02:04:44.505
No, Mommy.

02:04:44.636 --> 02:04:47.463
Is it Michael? Michael Murphy?

02:04:50.637 --> 02:04:52.289
Yes! Yes!

02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:54.465
Only you don't know how to say that.

02:04:54.595 --> 02:04:57.073
Will you teach Mommy how to say no?

02:04:57.161 --> 02:05:00.465
When you close your eyes,
does that mean no?

02:05:00.596 --> 02:05:03.771
Oh, what an idiot!
That was a yes question.

02:05:03.901 --> 02:05:08.990
All right. You don't want to hear
any more Benjamin Bunny, do you?

02:05:11.686 --> 02:05:15.208
That's an emphatic reply!
Very well, young man.

02:05:16.296 --> 02:05:21.515
No more Benjamin Bunny. How could
Mommy have been so thoughtless?

02:05:21.645 --> 02:05:26.298
We're going to take all of these
baby books to the children's hospital.

02:05:26.473 --> 02:05:29.995
It's time for the big stuff.
Something heroic.

02:05:30.125 --> 02:05:33.126
There you go.
You gotta tell us what you want.

"The boy slept well in the woodland nest,
where he had laid himself down."

02:05:43.868 --> 02:05:46.957
"At first, he only dipped
below the surface of sleep

02:05:47.043 --> 02:05:50.261
and skimmed along
like a salmon in shallow water,

02:05:50.349 --> 02:05:54.915
so close to the surface
that he fancied himself in air."

02:05:55.828 --> 02:05:59.264
"He thought himself awake,
when he was already asleep."

02:05:59.350 --> 02:06:01.133

and the leaves of the trees
rustling against them."

02:06:08.092 --> 02:06:11.310
"And he heard small changes
in the grass."

02:06:11.441 --> 02:06:15.964
"These little noises of footsteps
and soft-fringed wing beats

02:06:16.050 --> 02:06:18.834
and stealthy bellies
drawn over the grass blades."

02:06:18.965 --> 02:06:24.574
"A rattling against the bracken at first
frightened him, but interested him."

02:06:30.228 --> 02:06:31.838
OK. Is it your thumb?

02:06:34.621 --> 02:06:36.665
Is it your index finger?

02:06:39.275 --> 02:06:41.318
Your middle finger?

02:06:43.015 --> 02:06:45.407
Your little finger?

02:06:45.493 --> 02:06:49.973
It's your little finger. You think
you can move your little finger.

02:06:50.103 --> 02:06:53.930
OK. Tell your brain to tell your arm

02:06:54.017 --> 02:06:57.540
to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

02:07:00.541 --> 02:07:03.628
Come on, sweetheart.
Tell your brain to tell your arm

02:07:03.758 --> 02:07:07.151
to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

02:07:08.195 --> 02:07:10.804
Come on, my friend.
What a wonderful thing. A "yes."

02:07:10.934 --> 02:07:13.761
And then there'll be
a "could be" and a "perhaps"

02:07:13.893 --> 02:07:17.459
and maybe even a "shut up, Mommy",
but now we just have to get to "yes."

02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:20.676
So tell your brain to tell your arm

02:07:20.763 --> 02:07:24.068
to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

02:07:27.374 --> 02:07:30.984
Come on, my love.
Tell your brain to tell your hand

02:07:31.418 --> 02:07:33.462
to move your little finger.

02:07:36.419 --> 02:07:39.682
- Come on, Lorenzo.
- You can do it, my friend.

02:07:39.768 --> 02:07:41.812
You can do it.

02:07:43.204 --> 02:07:45.292
Come on, Lorenzo.

02:08:05.644 --> 02:08:09.080
And they are born
without myelin, correct?

02:08:09.168 --> 02:08:13.299
The only naturally dismyelinated
higher mammals in existence.

02:08:13.429 --> 02:08:15.821
And this is passed
from mother to son?

02:08:15.909 --> 02:08:17.952
Yes.

02:08:18.083 --> 02:08:21.388
Their mother is from Edinburgh.
That's Jasmine.

02:08:21.475 --> 02:08:23.954
She doesn't shake, but her male pups do.

02:08:24.476 --> 02:08:28.999
- You think you can stop them shaking?
- Well, we hope so.

02:08:29.129 --> 02:08:33.565
By implanting nerve cells, we expect
to see the growth of new myelin.

02:08:33.653 --> 02:08:37.088
We've been partially remyelinating
rats and mice for ten years,

02:08:37.219 --> 02:08:39.480
and it's repeatable.

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:45.916
But if we could fund this work,
it could be the first in higher animals.

02:08:46.046 --> 02:08:48.961
And then in human beings, huh?

02:08:49.091 --> 02:08:51.135
Well, in time, yes.

02:08:51.787 --> 02:08:55.440
Dr Duncan, if I help you
raise these funds

02:08:55.571 --> 02:08:58.876
and if we can get the researchers
together to collaborate,

02:08:59.050 --> 02:09:03.399
I think we can achieve
very much in a very short time.

02:09:03.529 --> 02:09:07.357
Augusto, we scientists
are a very competitive lot.

02:09:07.487 --> 02:09:13.011
Such a collaboration is a lovely idea,
but sadly that is not how science works.

02:09:13.141 --> 02:09:18.011
That's not necessarily so, because
remember the Manhattan Project?

02:09:18.142 --> 02:09:22.143
28 months. It took them 28 months.

02:09:22.230 --> 02:09:26.579
Now, if scientists can come together
to build the atomic bomb,

02:09:26.710 --> 02:09:31.624
surely they come together
to remyelinate some puppy dogs?

02:09:43.236 --> 02:09:45.844
<i>Papa called from Italy, darling.</i>

02:09:45.976 --> 02:09:49.803
<i>He's missing his Lorenzacchio
very, very much.</i>

02:09:49.933 --> 02:09:54.021
<i>But he wants me to tell you
he's making a big dinner tonight,</i>

02:09:54.152 --> 02:09:58.239
<i>a banquet of brain food for
the cleverest doctors in the world</i>

02:09:58.370 --> 02:10:02.502
<i>who've gathered together to put the
myelin back in the shaking puppy dogs.</i>

02:10:02.676 --> 02:10:05.241
<i>And if they can achieve that,</i>

02:10:05.371 --> 02:10:10.199
<i>someday there might be a way to help
all the people who've lost their myelin.</i>

02:10:10.329 --> 02:10:14.418
<i>Not only the boys with ALD,
but the people with multiple sclerosis</i>

02:10:14.548 --> 02:10:17.245
<i>and many other diseases, Lorenzo.</i>

02:10:18.028 --> 02:10:22.985
<i>And then think, my brave boy, if they
can ever give you back your myelin,</i>

02:10:23.115 --> 02:10:29.335
<i>you'll be able to tell your brain to tell
your toes, your fingers, your anything,</i>

02:10:29.465 --> 02:10:32.379
<i>- to do what you want them to do.
- ..what I want them to do.</i>

02:10:32.509 --> 02:10:34.858
<i>And then, one day,</i>

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:37.815
<i>I'll hear my voice</i>

02:10:37.946 --> 02:10:42.643
<i>and all these words I'm thinking
will get outside my head.</i>

02:11:56.357 --> 02:11:58.619
Oh! Now it broke!

02:12:02.924 --> 02:12:05.490
This is Charles and this is Harry

02:12:05.665 --> 02:12:08.665
and they've both been on
Lorenzo's Oil for two years.

02:12:08.796 --> 02:12:12.188
My name is Michael Benton
and I'm twelve and a half years old.

02:12:12.318 --> 02:12:15.798
I've been taking Lorenzo's Oil
for four and a half years.

02:12:15.928 --> 02:12:21.799
I was diagnosed with ALD when I was
13 years old. I'm taking Lorenzo's Oil...

02:12:21.930 --> 02:12:24.843
I've been taking Lorenzo's Oil
for three years.

02:12:24.973 --> 02:12:29.845
Some of the activities I'm involved in
are baseball, basketball...
