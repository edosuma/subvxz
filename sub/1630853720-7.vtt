WEBVTT

00:14.681 --> 00:15.932
Skadoosh.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.737
Watch, she's gonna start coughing.
They always do that.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.326
Huh.

00:36.619 --> 00:40.290
I am Rukhmini,
Protector of the Whip of Endless Flame,

00:40.373 --> 00:45.378
Last of the Desert Wind,
and Priestess of the Tianshang Guardian.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.547
Let us do battle!

00:53.678 --> 00:55.847
We can't fight you.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.182
Why not?

00:57.265 --> 00:59.100
I mean, you're really…

00:59.184 --> 01:00.435
-Old?

01:02.437 --> 01:03.271
Ow!

01:09.360 --> 01:10.612
How's that for old?

01:10.695 --> 01:14.282
Now, you shall pay
for invading the sacred city,

01:14.365 --> 01:17.202
trying to steal the whip.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.621
We're not here to steal the whip.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.247
We're here to protect it.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.668
Oh, the whip is clearly well-protected.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.295
Not from what's coming.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.798
We need to get it out of here.

01:29.881 --> 01:33.218
The whip
shall never leave this place.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.261
Nor will I. Nor will you.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.682
For there is no way out.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.393
No way out?

01:51.903 --> 01:55.573
Welcome to your new home.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.218
Back to the "no way out" thing.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.388
So, just for clarity,
are we, like, "trapped" trapped,

02:18.471 --> 02:20.140
or just, like, casual trapped?

02:20.723 --> 02:23.143
Because I don't wanna be
stuck in this… city.

02:23.226 --> 02:27.647
No offense. It's just kinda… mildew-y.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.567
Hello, Diya. Fine day, isn't it?

02:31.234 --> 02:32.986
Uh… Oh.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.071
-Hello, Diya!
-Don't patronize me.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.448
I am fully aware
that I am talking to moss.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.870
What about the Whip of Endless Flame?
Could that break us out?

02:51.963 --> 02:52.922
Huh.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.301
Its power does not work
within these walls.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.724
Tea?

03:03.308 --> 03:06.644
Listen, I know
you have little reason to trust us,

03:06.728 --> 03:08.563
but we want to protect the whip

03:08.646 --> 03:11.566
and honor Master Long-Tooth's legacy,
just like you.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.570
I have spent my entire existence
protecting the whip.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.031
You've really never left this city?

03:18.114 --> 03:19.532
Aren't you lonely?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.117
I have many friends.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.123
I was alone once, for three minutes.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.584
-Started talking to a radish. Ow!

03:30.168 --> 03:31.461
My apologies.

03:31.544 --> 03:35.298
I did not mean to belittle the devotion
you have put into your duties here.

03:36.799 --> 03:40.261
I have seen what power can do
when it lands in the wrong hands.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.934
It would be my honor to inherit your duty.

03:46.517 --> 03:50.104
To swear my life,
just as you did, to the whip.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.982
Lotta sauce on that one,
but still so cool!

03:53.691 --> 03:56.027
I see that your intentions are pure.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.612
However,

03:57.695 --> 04:00.198
I doubt you are capable
of protecting the whip.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.994
But perhaps
hope is not lost for you.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.831
There may be a way out of the city.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.376
There was a cave-in down there, years ago.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.544
It blocked the way out.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.548
-I can take you there if you wish.
-I think I see it!

04:18.132 --> 04:19.884
Great, let's get going.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.345
Po, what are you doing?

04:22.428 --> 04:24.889
What am I doing?
I'm trying to get out of here.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.182
Focus.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.435
Our mission is to get the whip,
no matter what.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.063
Mm!

04:32.146 --> 04:35.650
Maybe if we show her how awesome we are
by getting out of this creepy dungeon,

04:35.733 --> 04:37.944
she might pass the whip down to us.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.988
Huh? You know what I mean?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.449
I can't believe I'm saying this, but…

04:43.533 --> 04:44.701
That's a good idea.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.619
Ah! Uh-huh?

04:56.671 --> 04:59.757
Why don't you give us a lookie?
A little peek?

05:00.341 --> 05:02.927
Over my dead body.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.721
Huh?

05:04.804 --> 05:07.307
Oh, I can do that, I can.

05:08.391 --> 05:11.686
-Let's get to know each other a little.
-There's no point.

05:11.769 --> 05:15.440
Come on, give us a little something.
What's your name?

05:15.523 --> 05:17.859
Come on, you've gotta have a name.
Come on, come on!

05:19.694 --> 05:20.653
Colin.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.619
Colin? Colin?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.413
-What's so funny?

05:30.496 --> 05:33.541
I would've imagined
something more formidable.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.794
I'm a stag, named Colin.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.255
That's more than you need to know.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.136
He's hiding something, he is.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.262
So are we.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.230
Oh, hello there.

05:57.231 --> 06:02.361
The mayor. I've been smitten
since the day I made him, but I'm shy.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.363
You should tell him how you feel.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.033
He's moss. Moss!

06:07.116 --> 06:08.493
Don't patronize me.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.915
How have you lived without it all?

06:13.998 --> 06:17.126
Forests, mountains, the big blue sky,

06:17.210 --> 06:19.337
tea made with tea!

06:19.921 --> 06:21.839
You may soon live without it.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.300
I cannot guarantee your exit.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.431
We'll have to swing across.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.435
Or you may turn back now, if you wish.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.398
This is
what you're worried about?

06:39.482 --> 06:42.068
You're in very capable hands.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.748
Hm. Yes, quite impressive.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.044
Oh, you two have indeed
lived interesting lives.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.422
Should you fail to escape,
I imagine you will be missed.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.973
You're getting so big.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.647
Before I had you,
I was quite the traveler.

07:19.730 --> 07:24.193
Oh, you'll see the world one day too,
and you will do so much.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.072
Promise me, huh?

07:28.156 --> 07:32.535
No matter how big you get,
you will always find your way back home.

07:34.745 --> 07:35.580
Po?

07:36.706 --> 07:38.749
Po! Come back to us.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.751
-Huh?

07:40.835 --> 07:43.421
-Where am I?
-Hanging between life and death.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.633
Okay, now I feel like
you're trying to freak me out!

07:49.427 --> 07:50.720
Swing over here.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.306
-Now.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.644
-Come on!
-Come on.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.815
-Po!

08:13.951 --> 08:15.745
Nope!

08:15.828 --> 08:17.747
Zombie!

08:17.830 --> 08:20.500
It's me. What's gotten into you?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.293
I… I just…

08:22.376 --> 08:24.837
Mm, nothing. I'm fine, I'm fine.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.549
I, you know, w-whatever.
I just wasn't expecting a skeleton pile.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.511
Po, we need to show Rukhmini
that we can guard the whip,

08:31.594 --> 08:33.304
and you're having a bloody fit.

08:33.387 --> 08:34.347
-Buck up!

08:36.390 --> 08:38.309
You're making weird faces again.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.357
I-I don't understand. Take this seriously.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.070
I'm done.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.741
-Ow!
-Get out of my way.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.808
-I'll be back.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.394
I need to… water the shrubs.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.563
Thank you, go on.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.567
-I got it. I got the map.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.489
"Dawning moon. Waning sun."

09:33.573 --> 09:35.241
I think it's all in code.

09:38.160 --> 09:42.081
"My empty heart echoes as it beats."

09:42.164 --> 09:44.834
It's not code, it's poetry.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.794
I'm keeping this.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.037
Oh no. No, there's too many of them.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.164
Are you a kung fu master or not?

10:24.749 --> 10:27.001
Why are you suddenly afraid of everything?

10:40.890 --> 10:41.724
Po!

10:41.807 --> 10:43.726
-What are you doing?

10:43.809 --> 10:45.102
I miss my home.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.105
Listen to me, Po. We will get out of here.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.982
That's a promise I make to you.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.275
Okay, okay.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.193
Help.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.487
-Now, fight with me.

11:23.057 --> 11:26.143
-Thank you.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.188
I, uh…

11:29.271 --> 11:32.358
Perhaps I am not the guardian I once was.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.487
You, however, have proven yourself.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.615
You both have.

11:39.698 --> 11:42.326
Ooh! Mm-hm. Mm?

11:51.377 --> 11:54.004
Now, I think it's time we go.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.340
We? You're coming with us?

11:56.966 --> 11:58.175
Ah, yes.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.138
Goodbye, my love.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.978
I promise to honor your legacy.
To protect the whip with my life--

12:09.061 --> 12:11.021
Yeah, yeah. Let's get outta here.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.079
It's working.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.294
Come on.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.179
Go!

12:43.762 --> 12:44.597
Come on!

12:47.975 --> 12:49.018
Blade?

12:49.101 --> 12:51.187
-Po!

12:52.688 --> 12:53.814
Oh no.

12:54.982 --> 12:55.900
Hm…

12:55.983 --> 13:00.279
If we've read the map correctly,
the city should be over this hill.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.490
-No.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.742
-No!

13:05.326 --> 13:06.702
It has to be here somewhere.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.976
No map.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.271
Let's leave him here.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.273
And go where?

13:50.037 --> 13:52.206
One more step, and I'll…

13:52.289 --> 13:53.874
Calm down, Colin.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.545
I'm going to help fix your leg.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.880
No tricks.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.732
It healed.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.902
-You're welcome.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.195
You…

14:24.488 --> 14:25.322
You…

14:27.157 --> 14:29.535
-You're mages.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.661
Uh…

14:30.744 --> 14:33.914
Great, Klaus. Just great.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.590
Po, can you hear me?

14:46.635 --> 14:48.888
Stand back. I'm going to use the whip.

14:57.813 --> 15:00.399
-Huh?

15:04.653 --> 15:06.405
-What?

15:09.366 --> 15:12.161
No, no, no.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.580
No, no, no, no, no!

15:18.000 --> 15:19.877
Okay, Po.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.879
It's okay, just calm down.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.255
You can figure this out.

15:25.925 --> 15:26.759
There's a way out.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.679
There's a way out.
There's gotta be a way out.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.766
There's gotta be a way out.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.936
There's no way out.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.859
-Oh, Po?
-Huh?

15:47.780 --> 15:48.697
Whoa!

15:49.406 --> 15:50.324
Hello, son.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.703
Oh no! I'm losing my mind already.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.955
Or am I dead?

15:56.038 --> 15:57.790
Are we both dead?

15:57.873 --> 16:01.001
No, no, silly. You're not dead.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.046
I'm merely a figment of your anxiety.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.298
Ah… Phew!

16:07.341 --> 16:09.969
I'm sorry, Dad.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.930
I made a promise.
I told you I'd always come home.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.556
But what if I don't make it out?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.517
What if I let you down?

16:16.600 --> 16:20.729
Po,
you could never let me down.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.273
A piece of you is always home,

16:23.357 --> 16:27.027
and a piece of home is always with you.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.862
You can surrender,

16:28.946 --> 16:31.782
or you can summon
the strength I know you have

16:31.865 --> 16:33.450
to get through this.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.913
Ah, believe me,
you have more strength in your thumb

16:37.997 --> 16:41.333
than most people do in their whole bodies.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.003
Thanks, Dad. I do have it in me.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.673
I mean, I did imagine you and
this whole conversation. Kinda awesome.

16:47.756 --> 16:52.761
Oh yes, yes, Po. That is awesome,
but listen to what I'm saying.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.389
You have more strength in your thumb…

16:56.056 --> 16:58.225
than people do in their whole bodies.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.228
-In your thumb!

17:04.189 --> 17:05.983
The other thumb, son!

17:10.154 --> 17:13.240
You're not the Protector of the Whip.
You're not from the Lost City.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.826
-You lied. Who are you really?

17:17.536 --> 17:20.497
I am Rukhmini, the Raider of Raipur.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.292
Raider? You're a thief?

17:25.294 --> 17:26.712
A treasure hunter.

17:26.795 --> 17:30.174
And now that I have
my freedom and the whip,

17:30.257 --> 17:34.470
oh, my name will be known once more!

17:34.553 --> 17:36.805
Actually, you gave me the whip.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.391
Oh, actually, I didn't.

17:41.226 --> 17:47.232
I'll sell it to the Emperor of China
for a fortune and get what I deserve.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.374
I can't let you take that whip.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.886
I've been doing this
since before you were born.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.805
You're no match.

18:27.022 --> 18:28.357
I was trying to help.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.277
-I don't need the help of mages.
-"Ever subtle, ever sweet."

18:32.361 --> 18:37.157
-"Twisted and twined, our souls do meet."
-You stole my journal?

18:39.326 --> 18:40.661
Alright, thumb.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.497
Tell me you've got
some of that Tianshang magic, too.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.505
Whoa!

19:05.936 --> 19:06.770
Huh?

19:13.318 --> 19:15.779
-Whoa!

19:19.950 --> 19:22.536
-What are you doing?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.913
It wasn't me, it was the gauntlet.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.584
My arm!

19:36.717 --> 19:37.551
No!

19:41.305 --> 19:42.139
Oi!

19:48.896 --> 19:49.730
Ah!

20:03.285 --> 20:06.622
"For the maiden fair, my heart does beat."

20:06.705 --> 20:10.334
Colin Wolin, who's the lucky lady?

20:12.794 --> 20:14.630
Whoa!

20:58.298 --> 20:59.132
Oh!

21:07.599 --> 21:09.184
Aren't you supposed to be trapped?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.979
Aren't you supposed to be
a frail old lady?

21:12.062 --> 21:14.147
Aren't we supposed to be friends?

21:19.444 --> 21:20.946
Whoa, cool.

21:26.326 --> 21:29.288
A figment of my imagination
showed me that move.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.547
She played us.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.174
And now we've lost two weapons.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.720
Or did we?

21:44.803 --> 21:46.680
I used the thumb to get out of the city.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.932
It has some of the legendary power in it.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.935
If the gauntlet calls the thumb
whenever those weasels use it…

21:52.019 --> 21:54.313
Then the thumb could call the gauntlet.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.274
We don't have to search
for Klaus and Veruca anymore.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.817
We can bring them to us!

21:58.900 --> 22:01.153
Let's catch some weasels.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.162
My arm.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.500
What a rush, eh?

22:15.584 --> 22:17.878
I think this gauntlet likes us.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.759
-He's gone.

22:24.509 --> 22:28.513
-Come on, let's get you fixed up.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.148
I don't know how far I can walk.

22:38.231 --> 22:42.277
Don't be a baby, baby brother.
