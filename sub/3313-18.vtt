00:07.928 --> 00:09.509
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.011
HERE, HOLD MY EGG ROLLS.
AND DON'T EAT ANY.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.012
I KNOW HOW MANY ARE IN THERE.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.055
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I JUST REALIZED?

00:15.056 --> 00:16.096
TONIGHT IS OUR FIRST DATE,

00:16.097 --> 00:18.938
NOW THAT YOU AND I ARE
OFFICIALLY A UNIT.

00:18.939 --> 00:21.401
SO, FU'S PALACE ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT
CHINESE BUFFET

00:21.402 --> 00:23.063
WAS OUR FIRST OFFICIAL DATE?

00:23.064 --> 00:24.234
I DIDN'T THINK THAT THROUGH

00:24.235 --> 00:26.236
WHEN I CUT OUT THE COUPON.

00:26.237 --> 00:28.068
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY
GREAT ABOUT TONIGHT?

00:28.069 --> 00:29.319
IS THAT THERE'S GONNA
BE NO AWKWARDNESS

00:29.320 --> 00:30.860
WONDERING HOW THIS
NIGHT'S GONNA END.

00:30.861 --> 00:32.031
YOU KNOW, WILL THEY? WON'T THEY?

00:32.032 --> 00:34.204
'CAUSE WE KNOW.

00:34.205 --> 00:36.286
WELL, YOU KNOW, JOE,
A LITTLE WONDERING

00:36.287 --> 00:38.418
ISN'T ALWAYS A BAD THING
IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

00:38.419 --> 00:39.960
OF COURSE NOT. HURRY UP,
FIND THE KEYS, ALL RIGHT.

00:41.922 --> 00:45.125
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS WENT
PRETTY WELL FOR A FIRST DATE.

00:45.126 --> 00:46.837
ME TOO.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.804
WELL, GOOD NIGHT, CALL ME.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.097
( door locks )

00:57.098 --> 00:59.229
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

00:59.230 --> 01:00.230
HEY, MEL.

01:00.231 --> 01:01.601
( doorknob rattles )

01:01.602 --> 01:03.643
MEL!

01:03.644 --> 01:06.107
I'M SO EATING THESE EGG ROLLS.

01:30.881 --> 01:32.472
LEAVE ME OUT THERE ON THE PORCH.

01:32.473 --> 01:33.883
GOT TO TELL YOU, THOUGH...
MY FAVORITE PART WAS WHEN

01:33.884 --> 01:36.095
YOU PUT THE DEADBOLT ON AND
THEN SLID THE CHAIN ACROSS.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.718
- FUNNY.
- WELL, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:38.719 --> 01:40.810
YOU GOT THE MESSAGE.
CLEARLY, YOU DIDN'T.

01:40.811 --> 01:43.563
BUT, MEL, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE TOGETHER NOW.

01:43.564 --> 01:45.024
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED IN...

01:45.025 --> 01:47.357
JERSEY?

01:47.358 --> 01:49.939
I DO, AND IT WAS VERY NICE.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.321
YES, AND THEN WE GOT HOME

01:51.322 --> 01:52.902
AND THEN RYDER HAD
HIS APPENDECTOMY.

01:52.903 --> 01:54.824
THEN YOU CAME TO THE HOSPITAL AND
TOLD ME HOW MUCH YOU LOVED ME.

01:54.825 --> 01:56.946
AND I THOUGHT THAT MEANT
WE'D BE GETTING BACK

01:56.947 --> 01:58.908
TO DOING A LOT MORE OF THAT...

01:58.909 --> 02:00.871
JERSEY STUFF.

02:01.792 --> 02:03.743
LOOK, JOE, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

02:03.744 --> 02:05.545
OH, GEEZ, IT'S NEVER GOOD

02:05.546 --> 02:07.797
WHEN A GIRL STARTS TO
THINK AFTER A DATE.

02:07.798 --> 02:10.009
OH, IT'S JUST YOU
AND ME, YOU KNOW?

02:10.010 --> 02:11.461
I DON'T WANT TO RUSH INTO THIS.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.012
RUSH INTO IT?! WE'VE
BEEN LIVING TOGETHER

02:13.013 --> 02:15.014
FOR THREE YEARS.

02:15.015 --> 02:17.847
YEAH, BUT WE'VE BEEN
EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE.

02:17.848 --> 02:19.138
NOW WE'RE TWO INDEPENDENT PEOPLE

02:19.139 --> 02:20.520
HOPING TO BE A COUPLE.

02:20.521 --> 02:21.681
BUT WE SKIPPED OVER
ALL THAT STUFF

02:21.682 --> 02:22.972
YOU USUALLY DO WHEN YOU
FIRST START DATING.

02:22.973 --> 02:26.396
YOU KNOW, LIKE FLOWERS,
AND CANDY, AND, UH...

02:26.397 --> 02:28.027
I DON'T KNOW, A LITTLE MYSTERY.

02:28.028 --> 02:31.481
I'M EXPERIENCING A LOT OF
MYSTERY RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

02:31.482 --> 02:33.823
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

02:33.824 --> 02:35.985
I WANT YOU TO, YOU
KNOW, COURT ME.

02:35.986 --> 02:37.277
- COURT YOU?
- YEAH, WOO ME.

02:37.278 --> 02:38.578
ROMANCE ME. WIN ME.

02:38.579 --> 02:41.871
WITH FLOWERS AND CANDY
AND THE WHOLE SHEBANG?

02:41.872 --> 02:43.413
NO, JUST FLOWERS AND CANDY.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.786
RIGHT NOW I WANT TO
POSTPONE ANY SHEBANGING.

02:47.047 --> 02:48.289
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:49.880 --> 02:52.252
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK.

02:52.253 --> 02:55.174
WELL, I HAPPEN TO
THINK I'M WORTH IT.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.556
AND ANY GUY I'M SERIOUS ABOUT

02:56.557 --> 02:57.677
SHOULD THINK I'M WORTH IT TOO.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.679
LOOK, I THINK YOU'RE
100% WORTH IT.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.930
YOU KNOW, BUT I GOT TO TELL
YOU, I'M NOT REALLY THRILLED

03:00.931 --> 03:02.852
ABOUT THE NO-SEX PART.

03:02.853 --> 03:04.183
WE'LL GET TO THAT EVENTUALLY,

03:04.184 --> 03:06.646
BUT I WANT OUR RELATIONSHIP
TO TAKE THE SCENIC ROUTE,

03:06.647 --> 03:08.399
NOT THE BULLET TRAIN.

03:09.570 --> 03:11.232
PROMISE ME YOU'LL
THINK ABOUT IT?

03:12.483 --> 03:14.864
YEAH YEAH, I'M GONNA
THINK ABOUT IT.

03:14.865 --> 03:16.907
WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA DO TONIGHT?

03:22.162 --> 03:24.284
( swords clang )

03:24.285 --> 03:26.916
YES! I'VE BEHEADED YOU

03:26.917 --> 03:29.539
FIVE TIMES IN A ROW.

03:29.540 --> 03:30.920
WATCHING YOUR HEAD
BOUNCE DOWN A HILL

03:30.921 --> 03:33.883
WITH SQUISHY SOUNDS
NEVER GETS OLD.

03:33.884 --> 03:36.175
- YOU WANT TO LOSE AGAIN, LOSER?
- NOPE.

03:36.176 --> 03:38.298
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE DOCTORS
SLICED UP MY APPENDIX,

03:38.299 --> 03:40.680
THEY DIDN'T RUB IT IN MY FACE.

03:40.681 --> 03:42.972
HEY, LOOK, MORE OF
AUNT MEL'S DOODLES.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.555
UH, "M. B. AND J. L." WITH
A BIG HEART AROUND IT.

03:45.556 --> 03:47.106
AWW, IT'S KIND OF CUTE.

03:47.107 --> 03:48.938
IT'S KIND OF GROSS.

03:48.939 --> 03:50.480
AREN'T YOU HAPPY FOR THEM?

03:50.481 --> 03:53.903
ABSOLUTELY. IT'S NOT GONNA LAST.

03:53.904 --> 03:55.525
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:55.526 --> 03:56.906
MEL AND JOE ARE IN LOVE.

03:56.907 --> 03:58.988
THEIR SOULS ARE
ENTWINED FOREVER.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.861
YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING
WAY TOO MUCH "TWILIGHT."

04:01.862 --> 04:03.283
ALL RIGHT, GET UP, LITTLE MAN.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.534
IT'S TIME TO DIE AGAIN.

04:04.535 --> 04:05.915
( sighs )

04:05.916 --> 04:07.206
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
ALL I'M SAYING...

04:07.207 --> 04:08.868
MEL AND JOE TOGETHER,
I MEAN, IT'S...

04:08.869 --> 04:10.420
IT'S LIKE PUTTING TWO
FIGHTING FISH IN A BOWL.

04:10.421 --> 04:11.831
IT'S FUN TO WATCH,
BUT EVENTUALLY

04:11.832 --> 04:14.834
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FLUSH
THEM DOWN THE TOILET.

04:14.835 --> 04:16.586
( cellphone beeps )

04:16.587 --> 04:17.967
UGH!

04:17.968 --> 04:20.139
CRUDDY, ZANDER JUST TEXTED
THAT HE WANTS TO SEE ME.

04:20.140 --> 04:22.302
THIS TOTALLY GOES AGAINST
THE RULES OF THE PAUSE.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.933
YOU KNOW, WE AGREED
NOT TO SEE EACH OTHER

04:23.934 --> 04:25.435
UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE WANT TO DO.

04:25.436 --> 04:26.556
YOU KNOW, I STILL DON'T GET IT.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.558
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SAVE A LOT OF TIME

04:28.559 --> 04:31.020
AND BREAK UP WITH
THE POOR BASTARD?

04:31.021 --> 04:32.562
I CAN'T DO THAT.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.233
WE STILL HAVE FEELINGS
FOR EACH OTHER.

04:34.234 --> 04:35.945
SO STAY TOGETHER.

04:35.946 --> 04:38.197
I CAN'T DO THAT EITHER.

04:38.198 --> 04:40.279
YOU KNOW, IN TWO WEEKS, HE'S
GOING TO VERMONT FOR ART SCHOOL

04:40.280 --> 04:42.281
AND I'M STAYING HERE AT
UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.283
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP?

04:44.284 --> 04:46.826
ISN'T THAT WHAT SEXTING IS FOR?

04:46.827 --> 04:49.118
WELL, YOU'LL NEVER FIND
OUT BECAUSE NOW...

04:49.119 --> 04:50.460
( avatar grunts )

04:50.461 --> 04:52.962
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
SEXTING EQUIPMENT.

04:52.963 --> 04:55.836
WHAT... WHAT BUTTON DO
PUSH TO RE-ATTACH THAT?

05:01.632 --> 05:04.183
HOWDY, MA'AM.

05:04.184 --> 05:07.266
I HOPE YOUR PA DON'T MIND
THAT I COME A-COURTIN'.

05:07.267 --> 05:10.520
I BRUNG POSIES.

05:10.521 --> 05:13.853
WELL, I HOPE THIS MEANS
WHAT I THINK IT MEANS.

05:13.854 --> 05:15.194
YES YES, LOOK,

05:15.195 --> 05:16.315
I'VE BEEN GIVING YOUR
WHOLE COURTSHIP PLAN

05:16.316 --> 05:17.487
A LOT OF THOUGHT, ALL RIGHT.

05:17.488 --> 05:19.028
NOW I HAVE TO TELL
YOU, MY FIRST REACTION

05:19.029 --> 05:21.110
WAS CALMED BY A
VERY COLD SHOWER.

05:21.111 --> 05:23.943
BUT THEN, I GOT TO
THINKING, ALL RIGHT?

05:23.944 --> 05:25.825
YOU AND ME TAKING IT
SLOW, TREATING THIS LIKE

05:25.826 --> 05:27.827
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED ROMANCE...
IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD IDEA.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.830
- WELL, THANK YOU.
- THAT I JUST HAD TO IMPROVE A LITTLE BIT.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.331
- IMPROVE?
- RYDER!

05:32.332 --> 05:33.833
LENNOX, GET IN HERE. I
HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.005
YOU SEE, MEL, I CAN'T COURT
YOU AND WIN YOU PROPERLY

05:36.006 --> 05:37.507
WHILE STILL LIVING
UNDER THE SAME ROOF.

05:37.508 --> 05:39.048
WHAT? SURE YOU CAN.

05:39.049 --> 05:41.461
NO, COME ON, I CAN'T BE LIVING
ON MY GIRLFRIEND'S PAYROLL.

05:41.462 --> 05:42.802
YOU KNOW? GUYS!

05:42.803 --> 05:44.303
ALL RIGHT, READY?

05:44.304 --> 05:45.635
HERE IS THE NEWS.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.226
I WAS DOWN AT ALDO'S TODAY
DOING A LITTLE SHOPPING.

05:47.227 --> 05:48.928
BY THE WAY, I CHALLENGE
ANYONE IN THIS KITCHEN

05:48.929 --> 05:50.850
TO FIND ME A BETTER
SALAMI IN ALL OF TOLEDO.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.351
AND ALDO COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS

05:52.352 --> 05:53.733
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A NEW BUYER

05:53.734 --> 05:55.064
FOR THEIR GOURMET ITALIAN FOODS.

05:55.065 --> 05:56.856
YOU'RE AN EXPERT IN
GOURMET ITALIAN FOODS.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.029
DON'T GET AHEAD OF ME.
DON'T GET AHEAD OF ME.

06:00.030 --> 06:02.111
ANYWAY, THEY MIGHT AS WELL
JUST WRITTEN THE WANT AD:

06:02.112 --> 06:04.153
"JOE LONGO, GET YOUR
GLUTES IN HERE."

06:04.154 --> 06:07.076
'CAUSE ALDO HIRED ME

06:07.077 --> 06:10.249
AS THE NEW MANAGER OF WINE
AND IMPORTS ON THE SPOT.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.662
HUH? BOTTO!

06:12.663 --> 06:14.333
Lennox: WOW, GOOD FOR YOU, JOE.

06:14.334 --> 06:15.835
- YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

06:15.836 --> 06:18.257
OH, AND GUESS WHO'S GOING
APARTMENT HUNTING TODAY AT 5:00.

06:18.258 --> 06:21.921
I'M HOPING A GAY COUPLE
ON SOME REALITY SHOW.

06:21.922 --> 06:23.844
I BET IT'S NOT. I BET IT'S JOE.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.887
THE KID'S KEEPING UP.
YOU'RE KEEPING UP, HUH.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.600
SO PREPARE TO BE
WON, FAIR MAIDEN.

06:30.601 --> 06:33.433
I HOPE YOU'RE READY, ALL
RIGHT, 'CAUSE, UH...

06:33.434 --> 06:35.315
I'M ABOUT TO COURT
THE PANTS OFF YOU.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.778
IF YOU GUYS NEED ANY
MORE MYSTERIES SOLVED

06:38.779 --> 06:39.939
I WILL BE UP IN MY ROOM,

06:39.940 --> 06:42.782
BUT, UM, PLEASE KNOCK FIRST.

06:42.783 --> 06:44.784
UH, JOE,

06:44.785 --> 06:46.946
YOU KNOW, A NEW
APARTMENT, A NEW JOB...

06:46.947 --> 06:49.028
ISN'T THIS A LOT OF CHANGE
SUDDENLY HAPPENING ALL AT ONCE?

06:49.029 --> 06:51.120
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
MEL BURKE COMES UP WITH AN IDEA

06:51.121 --> 06:53.082
AND JOE LONGO MAKES IT
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.164
YEAH, WE ARE QUITE A TEAM.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.375
( cellphone rings )

06:56.376 --> 06:58.798
OH, THIS IS ACTUALLY
ONE OF THE APARTMENTS

06:58.799 --> 06:59.799
THAT I CALLED ABOUT EARLIER.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.501
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ONE.

07:01.502 --> 07:04.595
( female voice ) GOOD AFTERNOON.
JOE LONGO'S OFFICE.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.720
ABSOLUTELY, LET ME JUST SEE IF
HE'S AVAILABLE. PLEASE HOLD.

07:12.052 --> 07:13.813
WHAT THE HELL IS HE THINKING?

07:13.814 --> 07:16.225
I KNOW, THAT ACCENT IS HORRIBLE.

07:16.226 --> 07:19.819
NO, I MEAN, I ONLY WANTED
JOE TO COURT ME, YOU KNOW?

07:19.820 --> 07:21.981
I WANTED TO PROVE TO HIM I
WASN'T GONNA SLEEP WITH HIM

07:21.982 --> 07:23.062
JUST BECAUSE HE BOUGHT
ME SOME CHINESE FOOD.

07:23.063 --> 07:24.774
I STOPPED DOING THAT
WITH GUYS BACK IN...

07:24.775 --> 07:26.617
I MEAN, I NEVER DID THAT.

07:27.698 --> 07:28.698
I DON'T WANT JOE TO MOVE OUT.

07:28.699 --> 07:29.869
I LIKE HAVING HIM HERE.

07:29.870 --> 07:31.531
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
JOE'S DOING SOMETHING

07:31.532 --> 07:33.072
HE REALLY WANTS TO DO.

07:33.073 --> 07:34.834
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE A
SUPPORTIVE GIRLFRIEND?

07:34.835 --> 07:36.956
- OF COURSE NOT.
- AUNT MEL!

07:36.957 --> 07:38.287
WHAT? I'M JUST BEING HONEST.

07:38.288 --> 07:40.079
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY'S
FILMING THIS.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.171
I'M SORRY, I...

07:42.172 --> 07:44.794
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST NOT
A BIG FAN OF CHANGE.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.506
YOU REMEMBER HOW UPSET I
GOT WHEN THEY "IMPROVED"

07:46.507 --> 07:48.638
MY MARGARITA MIX.

07:48.639 --> 07:51.390
BUT, YOU KNOW, COME ON,
CHANGE CAN BE GREAT.

07:51.391 --> 07:52.431
YOU KNOW, WHEN JOE MOVES OUT,

07:52.432 --> 07:53.683
YOU GUYS WILL SEE
EACH OTHER LESS.

07:53.684 --> 07:54.974
SO THE TIME THAT
YOU HAVE TOGETHER

07:54.975 --> 07:58.648
WILL BE MORE MEANINGFUL
AND EXCITING.

07:58.649 --> 08:00.560
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF ROMANTIC.

08:00.561 --> 08:01.811
THAT'S TRUE.

08:01.812 --> 08:04.103
I GUESS HE'S TRYING.
I SHOULD TRY TOO.

08:04.104 --> 08:06.946
JUST... HIS IDEA'S JUST SO LAME.

08:06.947 --> 08:08.868
HEY, MEL, WANT TO
COME WITH ME TODAY

08:08.869 --> 08:09.949
TO LOOK AT SOME APARTMENTS?

08:09.950 --> 08:11.781
OH, JOE, I DON'T THINK I...

08:11.782 --> 08:16.495
WOULD BE A VERY SUPPORTIVE
GIRLFRIEND IF I DIDN'T.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.539
THANKS, BABE. YOU'RE THE BEST.

08:21.672 --> 08:24.334
LENNOX, AM I STILL SMILING?
I CAN'T TELL.

08:31.221 --> 08:33.092
THAT IS A NICE BEDROOM.

08:33.093 --> 08:34.934
I CAN SEE DOING SOME
STUFF IN THERE.

08:34.935 --> 08:36.265
THIS IS...

08:36.266 --> 08:37.977
BY FAR THE BEST PLACE
WE'VE SEEN TODAY.

08:37.978 --> 08:39.438
WILL YOU KEEP YOUR
VOICE DOWN PLEASE?

08:39.439 --> 08:40.270
HE HEARS YOU TALKING LIKE THAT,

08:40.271 --> 08:41.691
HE'S GONNA START
JACKING UP THE PRICE.

08:41.692 --> 08:43.352
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

08:43.353 --> 08:45.565
IT'LL BE FIRST, LAST, SECURITY...
2850.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.236
2850? WAIT A MINUTE.

08:47.237 --> 08:48.357
THAT'S MORE THAN YOU
SAID IT WAS ONLINE.

08:48.358 --> 08:49.739
WELL, THAT'S THE
BASEMENT APARTMENT.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.241
THAT WENT RIGHT AWAY TO THE
GOVERNMENT HOUSING PEOPLE.

08:52.242 --> 08:53.362
THIS IS ALL I GOT
AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.

08:53.363 --> 08:55.705
IT IS TRENDY EAST TOLEDO, JOE.

08:55.706 --> 08:56.746
EVERYBODY WANTS TO LIVE HERE

08:56.747 --> 08:58.457
THANKS TO A CERTAIN
COUNCIL MEMBER

08:58.458 --> 09:00.660
WHO PRESSED FOR BETTER
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

09:00.661 --> 09:03.713
NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN, BUT...
TOOT TOOT!

09:03.714 --> 09:07.426
SO, MY FRIEND, ARE WE HOME?

09:07.427 --> 09:08.798
I WANT TO, BUT I DON'T
THINK I CAN AFFORD IT.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.720
MAYBE IF YOU CAN KNOCK OFF
A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS.

09:10.721 --> 09:13.222
KEEP DREAMING. THIS IS EAST TOE.

09:13.223 --> 09:15.474
HEY, LOOK, TALK IT OVER, OKAY.

09:15.475 --> 09:17.136
TAKE THE APARTMENT, JOE.

09:17.137 --> 09:18.267
I WANT TO, BUT I
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

09:18.268 --> 09:19.639
- YOU CAN AFFORD IT.
- NO NO NO.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.350
I REALLY CAN'T. SEE, HE'S
CHARGING A CERTAIN PRICE.

09:21.351 --> 09:22.892
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY.

09:22.893 --> 09:24.854
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
CAN'T AFFORD SOMETHING.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.315
I'LL CHIP IN PART OF THE RENT.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.897
NO NO NO. YOU CANNOT DO THAT.

09:27.898 --> 09:30.239
YES, I CAN. THIS PLACE IS GREAT.

09:30.240 --> 09:33.242
TAKE MY MONEY, SO YOU
CAN BE INDEPENDENT.

09:33.243 --> 09:35.244
I DON'T NEED YOUR
HANDOUTS, OKAY?

09:35.245 --> 09:36.495
IT'S NOT A HANDOUT. IT'S A GIFT

09:36.496 --> 09:39.158
FROM AN INCREDIBLY
SUPPORTIVE GIRLFRIEND.

09:39.159 --> 09:40.289
IT'S A SWEET DEAL...

09:40.290 --> 09:41.961
A HOT BLONDE PAYING
ALL YOUR BILLS.

09:41.962 --> 09:43.793
YOU'RE MY HERO.

09:43.794 --> 09:45.374
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.

09:45.375 --> 09:47.126
SURE IT'S NOT.

09:47.127 --> 09:49.759
YOU'RE LIVING THE
DREAM, MY FRIEND.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.051
I'M NOT TAKING HER MONEY.

09:52.052 --> 09:55.474
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM
GONNA TAKE THIS PLACE.

09:55.475 --> 09:56.595
YOU JUST SAID YOU
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.057
YEAH, WELL, GUESS WHAT.
I CAN AFFORD IT.

09:58.058 --> 09:59.428
YOU KNOW WHY? I'M
GONNA CALL ALDO

09:59.429 --> 10:00.720
AND TELL HIM I'M GONNA
TAKE SOME DOUBLE SHIFTS,

10:00.721 --> 10:03.312
MAYBE EVEN TRIPLE SHIFTS.
I MEAN, I LIKE COFFEE.

10:03.313 --> 10:05.024
WHEN WILL YOU SLEEP?

10:05.025 --> 10:06.025
WHEN I MOVE INTO MY NEW PLACE.

10:06.026 --> 10:06.987
THAT'S WHEN I'M GONNA SLEEP.

10:06.988 --> 10:08.067
ALL RIGHT, I'M TAKING IT.

10:08.068 --> 10:09.528
IT'S MINE. WHOO!

10:09.529 --> 10:11.570
I'M EXCITED. THIS IS MY PLACE.

10:11.571 --> 10:14.193
I GOT A GREAT NEW APARTMENT IN
A GOOD, SOLID NEIGHBORHOOD.

10:14.194 --> 10:16.405
OH MY GOD! THOSE KIDS ARE
STEALING MY HUBCAPS!

10:16.406 --> 10:18.407
HEY, IT'S A CLASSIC!

10:18.408 --> 10:20.159
APPARENTLY, HE DOESN'T
NEED YOU AT ALL.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.540
BUT ME, PERSONALLY,

10:21.541 --> 10:23.242
I GOT NO PROBLEM BEING
SPOILED BY A LADY.

10:23.243 --> 10:27.547
WELL, I WILL LET ALL MY SUGAR
MAMA FRIENDS KNOW RIGHT AWAY.

10:31.051 --> 10:33.342
IS IT THE PAINKILLERS I'M ON,

10:33.343 --> 10:35.755
OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY
PREPARING FOOD?

10:35.756 --> 10:37.757
I'M MAKING BREAKFAST FOR MY MAN.

10:37.758 --> 10:39.759
THANKS, AUNT MEL.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.350
NOT YOU. JOE.

10:41.351 --> 10:44.393
OH. YOU KNOW, I
JUST HAD SURGERY.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.265
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN
HAVE THE PRACTICE OMELET.

10:46.266 --> 10:49.108
- IT'S IN THE SINK.
- DEAL.

10:49.109 --> 10:51.440
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I
HAVEN'T SEEN JOE IN DAYS.

10:51.441 --> 10:52.902
YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU HAVEN'T.

10:52.903 --> 10:55.614
BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE
WE'RE BEING SUPPORTIVE.

10:55.615 --> 10:58.237
JUST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
PRECIOUS TIME WE DO HAVE TOGETHER.

10:58.238 --> 11:00.079
THIS BLACK STUFF ON THE OMELET,

11:00.080 --> 11:02.081
THAT'S... THAT'S PEPPER, RIGHT?

11:02.082 --> 11:05.745
YEAH, LET'S GO WITH THAT.

11:05.746 --> 11:07.456
GOOD MORNING, GUYS. REMEMBER ME?

11:07.457 --> 11:08.838
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU
COME IN LAST NIGHT.

11:08.839 --> 11:10.750
MIDNIGHT, BABY. DOUBLE SHIFT.

11:10.751 --> 11:12.131
- ANOTHER ONE TONIGHT.
- WELL, THEN...

11:12.132 --> 11:13.883
SOMEBODY NEEDS A
HEARTY BREAKFAST

11:13.884 --> 11:15.425
MADE BY HIS GIRLFRIEND.

11:18.258 --> 11:19.388
I COOKED.

11:19.389 --> 11:21.470
THIS IS SO SWEET, MEL.

11:21.471 --> 11:23.352
- YEAH, SIT SIT.
- WOW.

11:23.353 --> 11:24.304
THIS IS OUR TIME TOGETHER.

11:24.305 --> 11:25.725
- OKAY.
- YOU KNOW, YOU AND ME.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.267
MEL AND JOE.

11:28.518 --> 11:30.649
THIS IS NICE.

11:30.650 --> 11:32.903
YEAH, THIS IS NICE.

11:36.026 --> 11:37.076
( cellphone beeps )

11:37.077 --> 11:39.869
AWESOME, WE GOT CRABS.

11:39.870 --> 11:41.280
WHAT?

11:41.281 --> 11:43.823
FISH MARKET JUST TEXTED ME.
THEY GOT THEIR CRABS IN.

11:43.824 --> 11:45.324
IF I LEAVE RIGHT NOW,
I CAN BEAT THE BUYER

11:45.325 --> 11:46.325
FOR ALFREDO'S GOURMET DOWN THERE

11:46.326 --> 11:47.326
AND SNAG ALL THE GOOD ONES.

11:47.327 --> 11:48.457
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR EGGS?

11:48.458 --> 11:49.458
OH, MY EGGS.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.130
YES, YOU WORKED
SO HARD ON THESE.

11:51.131 --> 11:53.172
OH MY GOODNESS.

11:53.173 --> 11:55.134
MMM, AMAZING.

11:55.135 --> 11:57.336
AMAZ... THERE'S A LOT
OF SHELLS IN THESE.

11:57.337 --> 11:58.258
( muffled speech )

11:59.760 --> 12:02.141
I LOVE YOU, THOUGH, OKAY?

12:02.142 --> 12:03.512
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

12:03.513 --> 12:06.346
BUT PROBABLY NOT, OKAY? ( gags )

12:08.849 --> 12:12.352
OKAY, HONEY, WHAT'S NEW?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.065
OH, UH, YOU PROBABLY
ALREADY KNOW THIS,

12:16.066 --> 12:17.696
BUT THE NEW MADDEN
JUST CAME OUT.

12:17.697 --> 12:20.199
AND IT HAS THIS NEW
HIT STICK FEATURE.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.661
SO YOU CAN JUGGLE THE BALL
OUT OF THE RECEIVER'S HANDS

12:22.662 --> 12:23.863
AND FORCE A FUMBLE.

12:23.864 --> 12:26.745
IT ADDS A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION
TO THE DYNASTY MODE.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.247
IT'S CRAZY.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.919
UH-HUH.

12:29.920 --> 12:33.173
WELL, THANKS, THAT...
THAT PERKED ME RIGHT UP.

12:37.968 --> 12:40.259
LENNOX, I HAD TO TELL
YOU THIS IN PERSON.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.341
WE COULD BE SO GOOD TOGETHER.

12:42.342 --> 12:44.553
ZANDER, THIS CAN'T HAPPEN.

12:44.554 --> 12:46.435
WE CAN'T VIOLATE THE PAUSE.

12:46.436 --> 12:48.848
PAUSE? THIS ISN'T
ABOUT THE PAUSE.

12:48.849 --> 12:50.309
NO, THIS IS ABOUT CASSANDRA.

12:50.310 --> 12:51.440
I WAS GOING THROUGH
SOME OLD EMAILS

12:51.441 --> 12:52.521
AND I FOUND THOSE SHORT
STORIES YOU WROTE.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.602
THEY'RE FANTASTIC.

12:53.603 --> 12:55.524
OKAY, WAIT. YOU
VIOLATED THE PAUSE

12:55.525 --> 12:57.026
BECAUSE OF SOME OF
MY OLD FICTION,

12:57.027 --> 12:58.948
WHICH SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE
SENIOR PRIZE FOR ENGLISH.

12:58.949 --> 13:01.951
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.
I'M OVER IT.

13:01.952 --> 13:05.074
BUT I HAD A REVELATION.
YOUR CHARACTER CASSANDRA

13:05.075 --> 13:06.785
WOULD MAKE A REALLY
GREAT WEB SERIES.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.747
SHE'S DRY, SHE'S COOL.

13:08.748 --> 13:10.039
SHE DOESN'T MOVE
AROUND A WHOLE LOT,

13:10.040 --> 13:12.832
SO SHE'S INCREDIBLY
EASY TO ANIMATE.

13:12.833 --> 13:16.125
WAIT, SO YOU DIDN'T COME
HERE TO UN-PAUSE US?

13:16.126 --> 13:18.337
NO, THIS IS ABOUT
A COLLABORATION.

13:18.338 --> 13:19.718
YOU WRITE. I DRAW.

13:19.719 --> 13:21.720
CHECK IT OUT. ( instrumental
music playing )

13:21.721 --> 13:23.382
LOOK AT HER.

13:23.383 --> 13:24.423
SHE'S CUTE, HUH?

13:24.424 --> 13:26.015
YOU DID ALL THAT?

13:26.016 --> 13:28.097
YEAH. OH, WAIT. WAIT
FOR THE EYE ROLL.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.098
( chimes sound )

13:29.099 --> 13:30.809
YEAH.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.892
WOW, THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

13:32.893 --> 13:34.854
THERE'S NO REASON WE CAN'T
STILL WORK TOGETHER

13:34.855 --> 13:37.196
WHILE WE'RE ON PAUSE, RIGHT?

13:37.197 --> 13:38.197
NO.

13:38.198 --> 13:40.400
NO REASON AT ALL.

13:46.286 --> 13:48.407
AUNT MEL, WHY ARE YOU
EATING THE TORNADO FOOD?

13:48.408 --> 13:49.788
ISN'T THAT FOR EMERGENCIES?

13:49.789 --> 13:52.541
WELL, THIS IS A LOVE EMERGENCY.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.583
MY BOYFRIEND'S BEEN
MISSING FOR DAYS.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.166
AWW, THAT'S SO SAD.

13:57.167 --> 13:59.798
ANYWAY, CAN I TELL YOU
ABOUT MY STUFF NOW?

13:59.799 --> 14:02.131
- ZANDER CAME OVER TODAY.
- REALLY?

14:02.132 --> 14:04.263
SO HE VIOLATED THE PAUSE?

14:04.264 --> 14:05.594
WELL, NOT TECHNICALLY.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.346
HE WANTS US TO COLLABORATE.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.388
HE WANTS TO ANIMATE MY
CASSANDRA SHORT STORIES.

14:09.389 --> 14:11.270
HMM, AND WHAT ARE
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT

14:11.271 --> 14:13.142
BEFORE I SAY MINE?

14:13.143 --> 14:15.524
WELL, CLEARLY ZANDER CAN'T
STAND NOT BEING WITH ME.

14:15.525 --> 14:17.236
BUT IF WE'RE WORKING
SIDE-BY-SIDE,

14:17.237 --> 14:19.478
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
HE'S SMELLING MY HAIR

14:19.479 --> 14:21.820
AND TELLING ME I HAVE
THE FACE OF AN ANGEL.

14:21.821 --> 14:24.073
AND THEN HE'S BACK
TO WORSHIPPING ME.

14:24.074 --> 14:25.404
BEEN THERE.

14:25.405 --> 14:27.196
YOU KNOW, IT'S TRICKY
TO WORK WITH AN EX.

14:27.197 --> 14:28.827
YOU JUST HAVE TO
BE PROFESSIONAL,

14:28.828 --> 14:32.412
AND DON'T LEAD HIM ON, AND
MAYBE COVER UP A LITTLE.

14:34.454 --> 14:35.584
THIS IS GREAT.

14:35.585 --> 14:38.417
YOU HELP ME WITH ZANDER AND
I HELPED YOU WITH JOE.

14:38.418 --> 14:39.628
HA! ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:39.629 --> 14:41.000
YOUR ADVICE WAS TERRIBLE.

14:41.001 --> 14:43.672
I SAID BE SUPPORTIVE.

14:43.673 --> 14:45.965
YOU ALSO SAID THAT BEING
APART WOULD BE EXCITING,

14:45.966 --> 14:47.346
AND IT'S BEEN AWFUL.

14:47.347 --> 14:48.767
OKAY, EVER SINCE JOE
TOOK THAT DOUBLE SHIFT

14:48.768 --> 14:50.509
DOWN AT ALDO'S, I NEVER SEE HIM.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.311
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
DO THIS ANYMORE.

14:52.312 --> 14:53.812
AWW, WHAT A SHAME.

14:53.813 --> 14:55.644
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT OF
YOUR FAVORITE WINE.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.106
- NO, I'M NOT.
- NO, TRUST ME.

14:57.107 --> 14:58.567
- YOU'RE COMPLETELY OUT.
- WHAT?

14:58.568 --> 15:00.229
HEY, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

15:00.230 --> 15:01.521
THAT'S GOOD BOOZE.

15:03.363 --> 15:05.324
ALL GONE.

15:05.325 --> 15:07.947
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE YOU
CAN FIND THIS CHIANTI:

15:07.948 --> 15:11.160
A LITTLE SHOP CALLED
ALDO'S WHERE JOE WORKS.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.372
OH MY GOSH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:13.373 --> 15:14.623
AND YOU HAVE TO GO THERE, NOW.

15:14.624 --> 15:16.585
OKAY, NOW THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.877
OOH, THIS IS SO EXCITING.

15:18.878 --> 15:20.089
WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA
KISS, BUT THAT'S IT

15:20.090 --> 15:21.300
BECAUSE HE'S STILL COURTING ME.

15:21.301 --> 15:23.632
OOH! ♪ I'M GONNA
SEE MY BOYFRIEND ♪

15:23.633 --> 15:25.544
♪ I'M GONNA SEE MY BOYFRIEND ♪

15:25.545 --> 15:27.386
I LOVE YOU, AUNT MEL,

15:27.387 --> 15:28.387
BUT IF WE'D GONE TO
HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER,

15:28.388 --> 15:30.639
I DON'T THINK WE
WOULD HAVE HUNG OUT.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.393
THE WAY YOU WASTE
BOOZE, DEFINITELY NOT.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.111
( knocking )

15:42.112 --> 15:43.522
- MEL?
- I KNOW YOU'RE CLOSED,

15:43.523 --> 15:45.484
- BUT IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
- ( lock clicks )

15:45.485 --> 15:46.986
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:46.987 --> 15:49.118
I'M OUT OF CHIANTI...

15:49.119 --> 15:50.740
AND YOU.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.532
- WOW.
- I MISS YOU.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.784
NOW I KNOW YOU WANT TO
BE AN INDEPENDENT MAN,

15:55.785 --> 15:58.377
BUT MEANWHILE, I'M AN
INDEPENDENT LONELY WOMAN.

15:58.378 --> 15:59.628
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE
THAN A CUP OF NOODLES

15:59.629 --> 16:01.130
TO KEEP ME WARM.

16:01.131 --> 16:03.252
YEAH, WELL, IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LOT OF DOUBLE SHIFTS

16:03.253 --> 16:04.883
IF I WANT TO GET
INTO THAT APARTMENT.

16:04.884 --> 16:06.385
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I TOLD ALDO

16:06.386 --> 16:07.386
TOMORROW NIGHT I'M TAKING OFF

16:07.387 --> 16:09.218
SO I CAN TAKE YOU OUT
ON A PROPER DATE.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.550
I DON'T KNOW IF I
CAN WAIT THAT LONG.

16:11.551 --> 16:13.352
GOSH, YOU'RE ALL HEATED UP, HUH?

16:13.353 --> 16:15.394
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
PLAYGROUND IS CLOSED

16:15.395 --> 16:16.226
WHILE WE'RE TAKING IT SLOW?

16:16.227 --> 16:18.437
WELL, THE SLIDE IS OFF-LIMITS,

16:18.438 --> 16:20.189
BUT YOU CAN GO NUTS
ON THE SWINGS.

16:20.190 --> 16:21.480
( chuckles )

16:21.481 --> 16:23.273
I'M NOT SURE I GET THAT.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.156
YOU CAN STEAL THIRD, BUT
I'M NOT WAIVING YOU HOME.

16:27.157 --> 16:28.317
AH, OKAY.

16:28.318 --> 16:29.408
YOU KNOW WHAT? MEL MEL MEL.

16:29.409 --> 16:30.659
I WANT TO. I REALLY DO.

16:30.660 --> 16:32.241
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I PROMISED ALDO

16:32.242 --> 16:33.662
I WOULD GET ALL THE
INVENTORY DONE TONIGHT.

16:33.663 --> 16:34.783
SO, TELL YOU WHAT,

16:34.784 --> 16:36.375
WAIT UP FOR ME. I
WILL BE HOME IN

16:36.376 --> 16:37.876
TWO HOURS, TOPS.

16:37.877 --> 16:39.578
DOESN'T INVENTORY
TAKE ALL NIGHT?

16:39.579 --> 16:42.000
WELL, I'M A HIGHLY
MOTIVATED MAN.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.333
- HMM.
- OKAY?

16:44.544 --> 16:46.255
OH, I... MEL.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.386
I REALLY GOT TO... OKAY.

16:47.387 --> 16:49.008
ALL RIGHT.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.096
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!

16:57.097 --> 16:58.637
OH, ALDO!

16:58.638 --> 17:01.019
ARE YOU HAVING SEX ON
MY SANDWICH BOARD?!

17:01.020 --> 17:03.192
OH, NO NO NO. JUST SOME
OVER-THE-BLOUSE STUFF.

17:03.193 --> 17:05.564
YOU KNOW, HE'S
STILL COURTING ME.

17:05.565 --> 17:07.406
THIS IS WHY YOU WANTED
ALL THE DOUBLE SHIFTS,

17:07.407 --> 17:10.319
TO USE MY SHOP FOR SOME
FILTHY SECRET CHEATING?!

17:10.320 --> 17:11.780
NO NO NO NO. I'M NOT CHEATING.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.152
SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

17:13.153 --> 17:14.703
AWW, THAT'S THE FIRST
TIME YOU'VE INTRODUCED ME

17:14.704 --> 17:16.536
TO SOMEONE AS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

17:17.657 --> 17:19.248
- YOU'RE FIRED.
- FIRED?!

17:19.249 --> 17:21.039
HEY, I GOT YOU CRABS.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.331
OUT!

17:22.332 --> 17:24.543
AND TAKE THAT DEFILED
CACIOTTA WITH YOU.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.376
WHAT DID HE CALL ME?!

17:27.377 --> 17:29.219
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CHEESE.

17:34.844 --> 17:37.176
OH, AND THEN CASSANDRA
TELLS ETHAN

17:37.177 --> 17:39.768
SHE KNOWS HE DIDN'T
READ SCHOPENHAUER.

17:39.769 --> 17:41.560
I CAN ANIMATE A PHOTO
OF SCHOPENHAUER

17:41.561 --> 17:43.272
MONTY PYTHON-STYLE.

17:43.273 --> 17:44.853
GENIUS. OH, OH!

17:44.854 --> 17:46.945
WE COULD MAKE THAT A RECURRING
LEITMOTIF IN THE SERIES.

17:46.946 --> 17:49.067
YOU KNOW, CASSANDRA
INTERACTS WITH HISTORIC

17:49.068 --> 17:50.359
AND LITERARY FIGURES.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.241
CHARACTERS FROM
NOVELS AND PLAYS.

17:51.242 --> 17:53.071
AND TELLS THEM WHAT
THEY'RE DOING WRONG.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.694
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.
- OH, YOU'RE THE BEST.

17:59.539 --> 18:00.829
OH, WHY'D YOU KISS ME?

18:00.830 --> 18:03.122
I DON'T KNOW.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.415
A HIGH-FIVE SEEMED INSUFFICIENT?

18:06.416 --> 18:09.128
SO DOES THAT MEAN, UH,

18:09.129 --> 18:10.169
WE'RE NOT ON PAUSE ANYMORE?

18:10.170 --> 18:15.345
YEAH, I GUESS WE COULD
ALWAYS PAUSE THE PAUSE.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.717
SO LIKE, HIT PLAY?

18:18.718 --> 18:20.520
AH, WHAT THE HELL?

18:23.143 --> 18:25.354
AUNT MEL, I HAVE
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.356
ZANDER AND I ARE BACK ON.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.567
SORT OF.

18:28.568 --> 18:29.818
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:29.819 --> 18:31.109
AH, I DON'T KNOW!

18:31.110 --> 18:32.231
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

18:32.232 --> 18:33.612
WELL, HERE'S A PIECE OF ADVICE.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.195
DON'T GO DOWN TO WHERE HE
WORKS AND GET HIM FIRED.

18:36.196 --> 18:38.157
WHAT DID YOU DO?

18:38.158 --> 18:39.739
( mocking Lennox ) I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.744
UH, I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S SAFE TO EAT.

18:46.206 --> 18:48.507
ALDO CAUGHT US MAKING OUT.

18:48.508 --> 18:50.749
- ON THE CHEESE?
- ON THE CHEESE.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.051
OH!

18:53.052 --> 18:55.254
YEAH, AND NOW JOE'S GOT NO JOB

18:55.255 --> 18:56.595
AND NO MONEY FOR
A NEW APARTMENT.

18:56.596 --> 18:58.387
AND HE'S RUNNING AROUND THE
NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT NOW,

18:58.388 --> 18:59.968
TRYING TO WORK OFF HIS ANGER.

18:59.969 --> 19:02.261
WELL, I KNOW THIS WASN'T
EXACTLY YOUR PLAN,

19:02.262 --> 19:03.432
BUT YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.563
HE'S STUCK HERE NOW.

19:04.564 --> 19:06.645
HUH, THAT'S TRUE.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.227
YEAH, YOU KNOW.

19:08.228 --> 19:09.768
HE CAN STAY HERE AS
LONG AS HE NEEDS TO.

19:09.769 --> 19:12.150
I CAN BE THERE TO PICK
HIM UP WHEN HE'S DOWN.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.193
I CAN BE HIS
SUPPORTIVE GIRLFRIEND.

19:14.194 --> 19:17.196
LADIES, IT'S A GREAT
NIGHT, ISN'T IT?

19:17.197 --> 19:19.238
JOE, LOOK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO HIDE IT, OKAY?

19:19.239 --> 19:20.279
I KNOW YOU'RE DEVASTATED.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.371
ACTUALLY, MEL, I'VE
HAD A REALIZATION.

19:22.372 --> 19:25.083
YOU KNOW, BEING IN SOMEBODY'S
HOUSE, TAKING CARE OF A FAMILY,

19:25.084 --> 19:26.285
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY
SATISFYING WORK.

19:26.286 --> 19:28.457
AWW, THAT IS A GREAT
WAY TO LOOK AT THINGS.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.789
EW, YOU'RE SWEATY.

19:30.790 --> 19:32.341
OF COURSE I WANT TO BE BACK
IN THE BUSINESS WORLD.

19:32.342 --> 19:33.422
AND I WILL ONE DAY,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:33.423 --> 19:35.594
FOR RIGHT NOW, I'M VERY
HAPPY SHAPING YOUNG MINDS

19:35.595 --> 19:36.755
AND MAKING A HOME RUN SMOOTHLY

19:36.756 --> 19:38.217
AND JUST DOING SOMETHING REAL.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.389
YEAH, AND YOU CAN DO THAT
HERE AS LONG AS YOU NEED TO.

19:40.390 --> 19:42.221
NO, UH-UH. NO.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.393
I JUST RAN INTO ZEV BUCHWALD
WHEN I WAS OUT ON MY RUN.

19:44.394 --> 19:46.265
HE WAS STANDING
IN HIS FRONT YARD

19:46.266 --> 19:47.726
WITH THEIR VERY COLICKY BABY.

19:47.727 --> 19:49.268
APPARENTLY, THEIR
NANNY JUST QUIT.

19:49.269 --> 19:50.859
SHE THREW IN THE DIAPER.

19:50.860 --> 19:53.522
ANYWAY, HE OFFERED ME
THE JOB ON THE SPOT.

19:53.523 --> 19:55.944
AND, YOU KNOW, SEEING THE
DESPERATION IN HIS EYES,

19:55.945 --> 19:57.776
I DID WHAT ANY GOOD
BUSINESS MAN WOULD DO.

19:57.777 --> 19:59.238
I GAUGED HIM.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.240
WAIT? WHAT NOW?

20:01.241 --> 20:02.201
YEAH, AND IT'S LIVE-IN.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.822
SO NOW I GOT A JOB
AND A PLACE TO LIVE.

20:03.823 --> 20:06.375
OH, AND THEY'RE PROVIDING
ME WITH A COMPANY CAR.

20:06.376 --> 20:07.536
( chuckles )

20:07.537 --> 20:09.588
WELL, IT'S A MINIVAN,
BUT IT'S RED, SO...

20:09.589 --> 20:11.039
THAT'S COOL, HUH?

20:11.040 --> 20:13.292
WELL, IF YOU'RE HAPPY, I...

20:13.293 --> 20:15.384
MUST BE HAPPY TOO.

20:15.385 --> 20:17.256
NOW THAT I'M AN INDEPENDENT MAN,

20:17.257 --> 20:19.217
OUR COURTSHIP CAN KICK
BACK INTO HIGH-GEAR.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.509
( chuckles )

20:20.510 --> 20:21.720
BUT NOT TONIGHT BECAUSE
I HAVE TO GO UPSTAIRS,

20:21.721 --> 20:23.302
PACK, AND MOVE OUT.

20:23.303 --> 20:25.223
NOW? IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.224
I KNOW. I'M ALREADY
ON THE CLOCK.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.346
AFTER 9:00 P.M.,

20:27.347 --> 20:29.017
IT'S TIME AND A
HALF, BY THE WAY.

20:29.018 --> 20:30.269
YEAH, THE GUY'S SO
SLEEP-DEPRIVED,

20:30.270 --> 20:32.272
HE'S BEEN LIKE AGREEING
TO EVERYTHING.

20:34.153 --> 20:36.405
AWW, AUNT MEL.

20:36.406 --> 20:38.817
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
REAL HAPPY RIGHT NOW,

20:38.818 --> 20:40.359
BUT DOES IT HELP AT ALL THAT JOE

20:40.360 --> 20:42.361
WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO TURN THINGS AROUND

20:42.362 --> 20:44.363
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN SUCH A
SUPPORTIVE GIRLFRIEND?

20:44.364 --> 20:46.366
NOT REALLY.

20:51.461 --> 20:54.753
( laughing )

20:54.754 --> 20:57.175
UH, YOU OKAY, AUNT MEL?

20:57.176 --> 20:58.927
YEAH, JUST HAVING
A GLASS OF WINE

20:58.928 --> 21:00.550
WITH JOE LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

21:02.091 --> 21:04.304
BUT...

21:05.144 --> 21:06.265
OKAY.

21:08.388 --> 21:09.728
To us.

21:09.729 --> 21:11.059
TO US.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.651
IT'S GREAT WE CAN STILL CATCH UP

21:12.652 --> 21:14.062
AT THE END OF THE DAY
OVER A GLASS OF WINE.

21:14.063 --> 21:16.985
Hey, did you hear that a
brand-new Madden just came out?

21:16.986 --> 21:19.027
What am I talking about? You don't
want to hear about that stuff.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.108
ARE YOU KIDDING? I HEARD THERE'S

21:20.109 --> 21:22.160
A NEW HIT STICK FEATURE. YOU
CAN ACTUALLY KNOCK THE BALL

21:22.161 --> 21:24.202
RIGHT OUT OF THE
RECEIVER'S HAND.

21:24.203 --> 21:25.614
I didn't know you like football.

21:25.615 --> 21:28.116
I have to tell you all about
my fantasy football draft.

21:28.117 --> 21:29.118
STOP STOP STOP. I WAS FAKING IT.
