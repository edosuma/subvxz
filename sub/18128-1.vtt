<i>- Dear Three Wise Men...
- No, no.</i>

00:25.834 --> 00:27.209
<i>Dear Three Swindlers!</i>

00:27.376 --> 00:29.709
<i>It's Zip and Zap,
the kids who asked you</i>

00:29.876 --> 00:32.334
<i>for a World Cup soccer ball and
a submarine last year.</i>

00:32.500 --> 00:36.251
<i>And we got neither,
just crappy presents instead.</i>

00:36.501 --> 00:39.334
<i>Let's be honest.
This relationship isn't working.</i>

00:39.584 --> 00:42.626
<i>You've been screwing things up
for years now.</i>

00:42.792 --> 00:46.417
<i>That's why we were forced to make
a very painful decision.</i>

00:48.709 --> 00:51.376
<i>Melchior, Gaspar, Balthasar...</i>

00:51.792 --> 00:53.001
<i>You're fired!</i>

00:54.167 --> 00:55.751
<i>Kick the road, losers!</i>

00:56.834 --> 00:59.251
<i>Oh, and don't worry about
our presents.</i>

00:59.417 --> 01:00.917
<i>We'll take care of that.</i>

01:09.209 --> 01:11.167
Merry Christmas, little bro.

01:13.626 --> 01:16.792
Where's my remote-controlled
submarine?

01:22.042 --> 01:24.501
Hey, check it out!
Fireworks!

01:26.792 --> 01:28.959
Look, a ball!

01:31.876 --> 01:33.167
What's this?

01:33.709 --> 01:35.209
It's a melon.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.209
Zip!

01:37.542 --> 01:38.584
What do I look like?

01:41.626 --> 01:43.417
A bonehead with a limp.

01:43.584 --> 01:45.584
Put that out and find some toys.

01:49.501 --> 01:51.376
Hey! Put that out!

01:54.417 --> 01:56.667
What are you doing?
Don't blow on it, lamebrain!

02:06.876 --> 02:08.292
Grab toys!

02:09.417 --> 02:11.542
Run as fast as you can!

02:11.993 --> 02:12.893
Let's

02:12.917 --> 02:14.417
Run, run!

02:19.626 --> 02:22.542
GAME OF VANDALS

02:22.709 --> 02:25.167
BLAME THE PARENTS

02:52.751 --> 02:54.084
Don't sigh like that.

02:54.251 --> 02:56.917
- Were not even allowed to breathe?
- No.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.167
You were going to let us
choke to death!

03:14.334 --> 03:16.709
Keep this up and you'll never
watch TV again.

03:16.876 --> 03:19.126
- You already said no TV.
- Then no more bicycles.

03:19.292 --> 03:21.834
We already did that.

03:22.542 --> 03:25.251
- Summer camp too?
- That too.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.959
I've got it. Make them
do dishes every night.

03:32.126 --> 03:34.209
No, they'll break
all of my dinnerware.

03:34.376 --> 03:37.126
Wow, you can't think of
any more punishment?

03:37.292 --> 03:40.126
Maybe because since the toy store
accident we've had them all.

03:40.292 --> 03:43.834
Accident? An accident is tripping
and spilling your soup.

03:44.001 --> 03:46.167
What you did is categorical
delinquency.

03:46.334 --> 03:49.042
- Categorical what?
- Come on, we're not criminals.

03:49.209 --> 03:50.334
The newspaper said you are.

03:50.501 --> 03:53.376
Well, it also said to blame
someone's parents.

03:53.542 --> 03:56.959
I'm only guilty of trying
to raise you right.

03:57.126 --> 03:59.667
Like I've always said:
you get what you deserve.

03:59.834 --> 04:02.042
Not again. I'd like to see you
when you were kids.

04:02.209 --> 04:06.334
I never disobeyed my parents.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.834
Integrity, decency
and proper manners.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.251
That was my motto.

04:13.792 --> 04:14.959
We must be arriving.

04:15.126 --> 04:19.209
- Arriving where?
- Yeah, tell us or we'll swim home.

04:23.292 --> 04:24.917
We're visiting...

04:25.459 --> 04:27.376
a publisher for my novel.

04:27.542 --> 04:28.792
How thrilling.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.417
- We'll be back for dinner, right?
- No.

04:31.584 --> 04:33.417
We're staying for a few days.

04:33.917 --> 04:36.834
We've decided that after
your last fiasco, you don't deserve

04:37.001 --> 04:38.167
Christmas vacation.

04:38.417 --> 04:42.667
- No Christmas?
- Take note, another punishment.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.667
You're the worst parents
in the world.

05:13.334 --> 05:15.876
ZIP AND ZAP
AND THE CAPTAIN'S ISLAND

05:26.626 --> 05:28.792
It's going to start pouring
any minute.

05:29.126 --> 05:31.876
You can start rowing because
I think we're lost.

05:32.417 --> 05:35.251
- Did you follow the directions?
- Every turn.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.376
Maybe the map the publisher sent
is wrong.

05:37.542 --> 05:41.251
Don't worry about us. We'd rather get lost
out here than go to Dad's thing.

05:41.417 --> 05:45.001
For once we agree. We'd rather
not have to look at you.

05:45.167 --> 05:47.417
We should drop you off
in the next ditch.

05:47.751 --> 05:50.876
Look! Finally.
We can ask in the town.

05:51.042 --> 05:53.334
Are you sure? That road
isn't even on the map.

05:53.501 --> 05:56.626
Come on, where's your sense
of adventure?

05:59.251 --> 06:01.376
I've never had one of those.

06:05.001 --> 06:06.834
TOWN

06:21.292 --> 06:23.917
Do you think we missed
the road to town?

06:25.167 --> 06:26.626
CHILDHOOD HOME

06:26.959 --> 06:29.334
It looks like an orphanage.
Should we ask inside?

06:32.626 --> 06:34.626
Hey, look at that guy.

06:39.459 --> 06:41.459
Get an umbrella, you pinhead.

06:53.501 --> 06:54.709
I'll be right back.

07:05.001 --> 07:07.042
How may I help the gentleman?

07:07.709 --> 07:11.876
I told him, this map is wrong.
Your father's just as stubborn as you.

07:12.042 --> 07:13.584
Hey, don't compare me to him.

07:13.751 --> 07:15.792
Mom, if you worry about everything,

07:15.959 --> 07:17.251
you'll never enjoy anything.

07:17.417 --> 07:20.584
It's better to worry,
later surprises come along.

07:20.751 --> 07:22.542
Sense of adventure...

07:22.709 --> 07:25.084
You can't just waltz through life
like a lunatic

07:25.251 --> 07:27.876
without thinking about
the consequences.

07:33.917 --> 07:36.584
Okay, change of plans.

07:36.751 --> 07:37.917
We're staying here tonight.

07:38.084 --> 07:40.751
- Are you sure?
- No, Dad! This sucks!

07:40.917 --> 07:43.584
Calm down. We got lost.

07:43.751 --> 07:46.251
And apparently we can only
go back the way we came.

07:46.417 --> 07:47.792
It's too dangerous in the rain.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.709
- We'll go tomorrow. Okay?
- No.

07:51.876 --> 07:54.667
- Let's hit the road.
- "Hit," he says.

07:54.917 --> 07:56.001
More like "kick."

07:56.459 --> 07:57.751
My novel.

07:59.751 --> 08:01.042
Thank you.

08:01.626 --> 08:04.542
And don't even think about
going in there with that.

08:12.376 --> 08:14.751
Please wait here.

08:15.167 --> 08:19.334
Miss Pam, the owner of the house,
will be down to greet you shortly.

08:23.084 --> 08:24.376
- Magnificent.
- Cool.

08:29.459 --> 08:30.626
Nice gang-

08:31.626 --> 08:33.167
Who are they?

08:36.292 --> 08:38.292
If you read a book you'd know.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.458
Captain Nemo,
Doctor Jeckyll and Mister Hyde,

08:40.626 --> 08:43.292
Peter Pan, Allan Quatermain,
Sherlock Holmes,

08:43.458 --> 08:46.667
the Invisible Man...
And the painting, Captain Hook.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.959
All great literary characters.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.209
How boring!

08:56.167 --> 08:59.167
It's a little peculiar, isn't it?

09:01.834 --> 09:04.751
Miss Pam has an amazing

09:05.209 --> 09:07.251
book collection.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.334
Wait until you see my other
collections, my dear.

09:12.542 --> 09:15.334
Welcome to you all.

09:17.626 --> 09:18.709
I'm Pamela.

09:18.876 --> 09:23.459
Or, as everyone here in this
little world calls me, Miss Pam.

09:23.917 --> 09:25.209
Nice to meet you.

09:27.709 --> 09:31.209
Jaime just told me the awful news.
How unfortunate!

09:31.376 --> 09:34.042
Lost and nowhere to go.

09:34.209 --> 09:36.834
- At first we...
- Luckily I'm here

09:37.001 --> 09:39.751
to rescue this happy family.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.292
Give me five?

09:46.209 --> 09:49.584
Too slow!
You'll have to be faster than that.

09:50.042 --> 09:51.084
Now, let's see.

09:51.251 --> 09:54.876
Raise your hand if you're...

09:55.459 --> 09:56.626
starving!

09:59.584 --> 10:01.042
Nobody else?

10:05.917 --> 10:09.209
Company march!
To the dining room!

10:13.667 --> 10:15.834
Family, tonight we have guests.

10:16.459 --> 10:19.459
My darlings, these are my children.

10:20.084 --> 10:23.417
Sister Enriqueta, their caretaker,
and Salomon, our gardener.

10:23.584 --> 10:24.959
You've already met Jaime.

10:25.126 --> 10:26.751
- Pleased to meet you.
- Yes.

10:28.251 --> 10:31.709
They look very happy and
well-mannered. How do you do it?

10:31.876 --> 10:33.834
Thank you, but I shouldn't take
the credit.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.542
Yes, Miss Pam, you should.

10:36.834 --> 10:40.542
Well, yes, but only because
I've given them a home.

10:40.792 --> 10:43.501
And in exchange,
they make me so happy.

10:43.917 --> 10:46.751
You see, life hasn't been fair
to them.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.876
They all come from broken homes.

10:50.042 --> 10:52.917
They were born into families with...

10:54.751 --> 10:55.751
troubled parents.

10:57.001 --> 10:59.084
- So none of them have parents?
- No.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.209
But they're very happy now.

11:01.376 --> 11:05.001
- No wonder. Nobody gives them crap.
- Zap, watch your mouth.

11:07.126 --> 11:09.667
You know what?
I didn't have parents either.

11:10.042 --> 11:13.251
They died shortly after I was born,
so I grew up alone.

11:15.251 --> 11:17.959
Well, not alone, because Jaime
was already working

11:18.126 --> 11:21.084
for my parents and he made sure
I was provided for.

11:21.459 --> 11:24.542
- Then you grew up in this house.
- Bingo!

11:24.709 --> 11:29.042
Unlike these children, I was lucky
enough to have rich parents.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.417
So rich...

11:31.584 --> 11:33.334
So rich...

11:33.751 --> 11:35.292
that I ate them!

11:37.876 --> 11:40.751
A few years ago
I decided to use my fortune

11:40.917 --> 11:44.501
to fill this house with children
who needed a home.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.917
The lost children.

11:47.209 --> 11:49.001
But there's a girl missing, right?

11:49.167 --> 11:52.667
- A redhead.
- Oh, yes, that's right.

11:53.209 --> 11:54.417
Where is Pippi, Sister?

11:54.584 --> 11:57.417
Probably reading one of those
novels she loves.

12:02.084 --> 12:05.292
Shouldn't she be here
having dinner with everyone?

12:05.459 --> 12:09.459
My dear, this home is ruled by harmony.
I never impose rules on my children.

12:09.667 --> 12:12.459
Childhood is a time for freedom
to experiment.

12:12.626 --> 12:15.459
Besides, Pippi is a very unique
little girl.

12:16.542 --> 12:21.292
I try to set limits, but with these two
we haven't had much luck.

12:22.376 --> 12:25.167
The system in your orphanage
might work better.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.542
That's an ugly word.

12:33.751 --> 12:36.376
We prefer to call it
a childhood home.

12:36.542 --> 12:39.501
After all, once you cross
the threshold into my world,

12:39.709 --> 12:42.376
you forever become a part

12:42.751 --> 12:44.876
of my big family.

12:54.292 --> 12:57.126
The gentleman and his wife
can sleep in this room.

13:05.792 --> 13:10.167
- And the boys?
- They can sleep in the children's wing.

13:10.667 --> 13:13.917
A house with wings! And we get
the cool one, with no parents.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.251
Behave yourselves.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.292
I don't want any
horsing around or...

13:17.459 --> 13:21.001
Monkey business. Okay, Dad.
We promise not to have any fun.

13:21.167 --> 13:25.167
Stop complaining and think about
those poor kids without parents.

13:25.334 --> 13:28.084
Poor kids? With Miss Pam
they won the lottery.

13:28.834 --> 13:31.251
Come here, you dummies.

13:31.501 --> 13:34.751
You'll miss us some day,
you'll see.

13:36.251 --> 13:38.292
Mom, please, stop...

13:38.459 --> 13:40.001
That's enough.

13:40.167 --> 13:43.626
A loving kiss is like rain,
it washes away the pain.

13:44.459 --> 13:46.084
It's a secret.

13:48.584 --> 13:50.417
No good night kiss for your boys?

13:52.334 --> 13:54.584
- No way.
- Yeah, no way.

14:18.751 --> 14:20.417
What's up, blondie?

14:24.584 --> 14:27.209
- But...?
- Shh, you'll scare him.

14:27.751 --> 14:30.584
- Scare who?
- The ghost.

14:37.292 --> 14:40.001
Hey, why is the window open?

14:44.917 --> 14:48.084
So a girl came in
through the window?

14:50.084 --> 14:51.959
You wish.

14:58.376 --> 14:59.626
LOG RAFT

15:19.917 --> 15:21.292
Come on!

15:32.042 --> 15:33.959
He's in there.

15:34.126 --> 15:37.167
- Who?
- The ghost.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.542
Great, you scared him away.

16:12.792 --> 16:15.626
Sorry, with the window open I...

16:15.792 --> 16:18.042
We won't catch him tonight.

16:18.584 --> 16:20.209
Who, the ghost?

16:20.376 --> 16:22.834
There was nobody there, you wacko.

16:30.876 --> 16:31.776
Hey.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.501
Wait.

16:34.001 --> 16:35.751
What's your name?

16:39.751 --> 16:41.376
I'm Pippi.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.376
This girl has a screw loose.

17:05.334 --> 17:07.626
If you would be so kind
as to follow me,

17:07.959 --> 17:10.666
Miss Pam would like
to speak with you.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.416
Boys, I have something to tell you.
And, well,

17:24.584 --> 17:26.126
it's a delicate subject.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.834
Spit it out quickly,
the donuts are waiting.

17:29.001 --> 17:32.709
- Your parents are gone.
- What do you mean, gone? Where?

17:33.334 --> 17:36.042
- They left.
- They'll be back.

17:36.209 --> 17:39.084
This way we don't have to go
see his boring publisher.

17:39.251 --> 17:41.501
Darling, there is no boring
publisher.

17:41.667 --> 17:44.376
That's the excuse they made up
to bring you here.

17:48.126 --> 17:51.501
They... gave up on you boys.

17:51.751 --> 17:55.667
Burning that toy store was the
last straw. Their patience ran out.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.459
What are you saying?

17:57.626 --> 18:01.334
Your parents don't want you anymore
and they abandoned you here...

18:01.626 --> 18:03.167
forever.

18:07.459 --> 18:10.876
What? Mr. Grumpy and Mrs. Bossy
without us...?

18:11.042 --> 18:14.667
Yeah, right! Who are they
going to boss around?

18:17.417 --> 18:18.667
- Zap.
- What?

18:18.834 --> 18:20.209
She's not laughing.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.251
No.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.376
She isn't.

18:57.042 --> 18:58.792
The car is gone.

19:02.584 --> 19:03.792
It's true, Zap.

19:04.376 --> 19:05.667
They left.

19:06.709 --> 19:08.959
They took my slingshot?

19:10.167 --> 19:11.667
To hell with them!

19:19.001 --> 19:20.459
Child...

19:21.376 --> 19:22.959
Why are you crying?

19:23.709 --> 19:26.167
You're better off without
people who don't love you.

19:34.876 --> 19:37.459
How are you, children?
Who's winning?

19:37.626 --> 19:39.334
Oh, my little chicks!

19:41.959 --> 19:43.209
Listen up, my children.

19:43.376 --> 19:46.501
We have two new members.
Welcome them like you know how.

19:46.751 --> 19:48.959
Emoclew, emoclew!

19:49.126 --> 19:51.959
Emoclew, emoclew, emoclew!

19:54.126 --> 19:55.959
My children don't say "welcome,"

19:56.126 --> 19:59.876
they say it backwards:
"Emoclew."

20:00.292 --> 20:02.001
Now go and play.

20:02.251 --> 20:03.209
Go on.

20:05.751 --> 20:09.292
Okay, children.
Who feels like singing?

20:09.459 --> 20:12.584
Me, me, me!

20:12.834 --> 20:14.084
Wonderful.

20:19.167 --> 20:21.876
But you know who gets to sing
the first rhyme?

20:23.542 --> 20:24.876
Exactly!

20:25.042 --> 20:26.709
The new boys.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.751
Okay, little chicks, it's easy.

20:29.917 --> 20:32.751
I sing a verse
and you make it rhyme. Got it?

20:33.334 --> 20:34.501
Here we go!

20:34.917 --> 20:37.167
<i>Singing is my medicine.</i>

20:37.334 --> 20:41.667
<i>I do it all the time.
I don't need a pill,</i>

20:41.834 --> 20:43.959
<i>just make the song...</i>

20:45.459 --> 20:46.459
"Rhyme."

20:47.459 --> 20:51.001
- "Rhyme."
- Come on, little chicks, it's easy.

20:55.751 --> 20:57.584
<i>Singing is my medicine.</i>

20:57.751 --> 21:02.834
<i>I do it all the time.
I don't need a pill...</i>

21:03.001 --> 21:05.126
Go suck on a lime!

21:41.751 --> 21:44.209
What happened here?

21:45.042 --> 21:46.001
Did I do that?

21:46.959 --> 21:50.126
How clumsy of me!

21:58.751 --> 22:03.834
Let's show our new friends
what a wonderful place this is.

22:11.917 --> 22:14.376
<i>We're the lost children,</i>

22:14.542 --> 22:17.584
<i>who can ask for anything more.
Living at a childhood home</i>

22:17.751 --> 22:20.917
<i>is never a bore.
Always happy,</i>

22:21.084 --> 22:24.417
<i>happy as a clam.
Because instead of parents,</i>

22:24.584 --> 22:26.584
<i>we've got Miss Pam.</i>

22:26.751 --> 22:30.459
<i>Be yourself and have a good time.</i>

22:30.626 --> 22:33.792
<i>Do whatever you want,
it's not a crime.</i>

22:33.959 --> 22:35.709
<i>You can jump in a puddle.</i>

22:35.876 --> 22:37.751
<i>She can drink from the bottle.</i>

22:37.917 --> 22:41.001
<i>No teeth brushing for me.
They look better black, you see?</i>

22:41.167 --> 22:45.167
<i>Do whatever you want,
even undo what you didn't.</i>

22:45.417 --> 22:48.917
<i>You can have it all.
With no rules the sky's the limit.</i>

22:49.084 --> 22:52.501
<i>Do whatever you want,
even undo what you didn't.</i>

22:52.667 --> 22:56.792
<i>With no rules, the sky's the limit.</i>

22:56.959 --> 22:59.751
<i>Pippi acts with passion,
she was born for the stage.</i>

22:59.917 --> 23:03.792
<i>Novels and awesome stories,
they're all the rage.</i>

23:03.959 --> 23:07.126
<i>Here comes Salomon,
always with something to fix.</i>

23:07.292 --> 23:11.667
<i>We've never seen him smile,
but he knows amazing tricks.</i>

23:12.251 --> 23:15.584
<i>Jaime's like a robot,
a robot with one hand.</i>

23:15.751 --> 23:20.334
<i>He can dust, paint and sweep,
or even play like a band.</i>

23:20.501 --> 23:24.126
<i>Do whatever you want,
even undo what you didn't.</i>

23:24.292 --> 23:27.751
<i>You can have it all.
With no rules, the sky's the limit.</i>

23:27.917 --> 23:31.834
<i>Do whatever you want,
even undo what you didn't.</i>

23:32.001 --> 23:35.584
<i>You can have it all.
With no rules, the sky's the limit.</i>

23:35.751 --> 23:39.584
<i>Now smile and give us a rhyme,</i>

23:39.751 --> 23:41.376
<i>give it a chance...</i>

23:41.709 --> 23:43.876
Come on, little chicks.
What do you say?

23:47.292 --> 23:52.042
<i>Eat my underpants!</i>

23:55.876 --> 23:57.459
No!

23:59.959 --> 24:03.751
<i>Do whatever you want,
even undo what you didn't.</i>

24:03.917 --> 24:07.584
<i>You can have it all.
With no rules, the sky's the limit.</i>

24:07.751 --> 24:11.042
<i>Do whatever you want,
even undo what you didn't.</i>

24:11.209 --> 24:15.001
<i>You can have it all.
With no rules, the sky's the limit!</i>

25:07.917 --> 25:09.709
Good morning, darlings.

25:10.459 --> 25:12.667
- How are we today?
- Bad.

25:12.876 --> 25:15.959
Just like yesterday, and the day
before, and the day before...

25:16.126 --> 25:18.126
- Yes, I got it.
- Please, let us go.

25:18.292 --> 25:21.251
- Do it for our children.
- I am doing it for them, my dear.

25:21.501 --> 25:23.251
Everything I do is for the children.

25:23.417 --> 25:26.376
What have you done to them?
They'd better be safe and sound or...

25:26.542 --> 25:29.042
Or what?
What will you do to me?

25:30.376 --> 25:34.042
Punish me with no vacation?
Or maybe smack me?

25:34.626 --> 25:36.001
She's crazy.

25:36.667 --> 25:39.584
But I have an appointment
with a publisher who lives

25:39.751 --> 25:41.376
- on this island.
- Yes, the appointment.

25:41.542 --> 25:45.334
Did he insist by any chance
on meeting the whole family?

25:45.834 --> 25:49.251
Did he ask you for a photo
of when you were both children

25:49.417 --> 25:51.209
for the cover?

25:52.292 --> 25:55.126
We're the only ones
who live on this island, my dear.

25:55.334 --> 25:56.501
You know why?

25:57.042 --> 25:58.501
Because this island is...

25:59.376 --> 26:00.542
mine.

26:05.126 --> 26:07.792
I'm sorry, but I'm not at all
interested in your novel.

26:08.209 --> 26:11.209
It's unimaginative and arrogant.

26:11.751 --> 26:13.167
Typical of adults.

26:14.751 --> 26:16.501
The children are ready.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.584
Take them away.

26:36.542 --> 26:39.459
Oh, you're here. Perfect.

26:39.626 --> 26:41.334
- Come in.
- Go on.

26:41.501 --> 26:42.917
Walk.

26:43.709 --> 26:45.376
Isn't this thrilling?

26:46.001 --> 26:48.167
No matter how many times
I do this, I always get

26:48.334 --> 26:50.292
that tingle like the first day.

26:50.459 --> 26:51.779
What are you going to do with us?

26:51.803 --> 26:53.762
Please, don't be melodramatic.

26:54.001 --> 26:55.667
I'm giving you a free trip.

26:55.834 --> 26:58.167
- A trip where?
- Not where, my dear.

27:00.001 --> 27:01.417
When.

27:11.417 --> 27:13.917
Which memories would you like
them to retain?

27:14.084 --> 27:16.209
Only to age eleven.

27:17.709 --> 27:20.501
May I have the photos of them
when they were children?

27:29.751 --> 27:30.834
Ready when you are.

27:31.001 --> 27:32.876
TRANSFORMATION

28:07.876 --> 28:10.459
You can come out, don't be shy.

28:18.959 --> 28:21.584
Welcome to the childhood home,
children.

28:43.084 --> 28:44.251
Listen up, darlings.

28:44.417 --> 28:46.959
Two new children
are joining our family.

28:47.334 --> 28:48.959
Let's give them a big welcome.

28:49.126 --> 28:53.876
Emoclew, emoclew, emoclew!

28:57.542 --> 29:01.126
Who wants to be the first
to introduce yourself?

29:01.542 --> 29:03.001
Me, me, me!

29:03.542 --> 29:04.667
Hi, my name is Flecky.

29:04.834 --> 29:08.876
Miss Pam said this is my new home
because my parents got tired of me.

29:09.042 --> 29:10.542
Actually I'm a little sad

29:10.709 --> 29:12.751
and I don't really feel like talking.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.834
But when I cheer up, I never stop.

29:16.417 --> 29:18.959
Oh, and my shoe size
is 5 and a half.

29:19.667 --> 29:21.417
Go ahead, my boy.

29:21.751 --> 29:23.042
Tell us your name.

29:23.376 --> 29:25.709
Come on, don't be shy.

29:28.751 --> 29:31.626
<i>Macky!</i>

29:35.167 --> 29:36.459
Well?

29:37.209 --> 29:39.126
You want to hear my last name too?

29:39.292 --> 29:42.626
- That Flecky is a total freak.
- And the other kid's a pig.

29:42.792 --> 29:44.792
Though she's pretty cute.

29:44.959 --> 29:47.459
Does he think he's the only kid
who can burp his name?

29:51.001 --> 29:53.626
Hi, new roommates!

29:54.042 --> 29:56.001
Hi, I'm Zip and this
is my brother Zap.

29:56.376 --> 29:58.501
- Have you picked your bed yet?
- No.

29:58.667 --> 30:02.167
All 4 are fantastic. Except that one,
that one and that one.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.917
So you want this one?

30:05.834 --> 30:09.292
Is it yours? If it is,
I'll take a less fantastic one.

30:09.459 --> 30:13.709
No, it's okay. I don't even like it.
Well, I like it

30:14.126 --> 30:16.042
because you picked it.

30:19.792 --> 30:21.209
Which one is yours, Knucklehead?

30:21.667 --> 30:22.959
This one.

30:23.376 --> 30:25.209
Then that settles it.

30:28.542 --> 30:29.792
Already moved in.

30:29.959 --> 30:32.376
Forget it. Either move out
or I'll move you out.

30:36.876 --> 30:40.042
Look, kid. There's only room
for one rooster in this henhouse.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.667
And the job... is taken.

30:43.834 --> 30:46.542
So kick the road.

30:48.751 --> 30:50.042
Geez Louise!

30:51.792 --> 30:54.751
Hey, it looks like there is room
for two roosters in this henhouse.

30:55.542 --> 30:56.917
- Right, chicken?
- Rooster.

30:57.084 --> 30:58.834
- Chicken.
- Rooster.

30:59.001 --> 31:00.542
- Chicken!
- Rooster!

31:00.709 --> 31:03.667
Boys, don't fight.
Talking is always the answer.

31:04.042 --> 31:05.959
Well, unless you're deaf or mute,

31:06.126 --> 31:08.459
they just go like this.

31:10.709 --> 31:11.834
Never mind.

31:12.001 --> 31:14.834
Let's see who's nicer and gives
his bed to the other one.

31:36.042 --> 31:38.251
Here, sea monkey!

31:38.417 --> 31:40.167
Come here, don't run away!

31:40.334 --> 31:42.292
We've got a couple of gems here.

31:43.209 --> 31:45.126
Always shutting the window!

31:46.542 --> 31:50.126
Great, the whole circus is here.

31:51.584 --> 31:52.876
It's okay, she's a friend.

31:53.417 --> 31:57.126
Be quiet, guys!
I'm trying to sleep.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.959
Hubba, hubba!
Who's the knockout?

32:01.876 --> 32:06.251
- Pippi, where are you going?
- To catch that ghost once and for all.

32:12.459 --> 32:13.792
Anyone want to come along?

32:16.917 --> 32:18.251
Rock and roll.

32:28.626 --> 32:31.001
I can't believe how brave you are.

32:32.792 --> 32:34.959
I love brave girls.

32:36.917 --> 32:40.042
- How do you like boys?
- Medium rare.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.084
Wait, I think he's in there.

33:06.667 --> 33:09.042
He's right there, looking at us.

33:09.584 --> 33:12.042
He was following us.

33:27.417 --> 33:30.126
The only ghost I see around here

33:30.292 --> 33:31.542
is him.

33:31.709 --> 33:34.626
- That's gonna cost you.
- See? I can see right through him.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.501
Shut up, Knucklehead!

33:40.001 --> 33:42.292
You see? It's the ghost!

33:43.626 --> 33:45.084
Uh-oh.

33:46.126 --> 33:47.459
What the heck...?

33:51.876 --> 33:53.459
Take that, right in the face!

33:56.709 --> 33:57.834
Hit the ground!

33:58.417 --> 34:00.209
He's hitting us with
the whole library!

34:00.376 --> 34:02.167
Come on!

34:04.667 --> 34:07.292
Hey, the ghost is that way!

34:17.501 --> 34:19.417
Where are they going?

34:24.042 --> 34:26.126
Mr. Ghost...?

34:28.708 --> 34:31.251
Where are you, Mr. Ghost?

34:31.667 --> 34:34.292
Tonight I'm going to catch you.

34:47.542 --> 34:49.042
The compass.

35:30.376 --> 35:32.251
Wait, Flecky, wait.

35:36.542 --> 35:37.792
Does it hurt?

35:39.626 --> 35:42.167
Well, it might go away

35:42.751 --> 35:43.917
if...

35:44.209 --> 35:46.042
if you give me a...

35:46.209 --> 35:48.001
- Oh, forget it.
- No, tell me.

35:48.167 --> 35:49.209
What do you need?

35:49.459 --> 35:51.251
They say...

35:51.751 --> 35:53.376
that a loving kiss is like rain,

35:53.834 --> 35:55.542
it washes away the pain.

35:56.417 --> 35:57.501
Really?

35:59.542 --> 36:02.084
Science is advancing so fast.

36:02.751 --> 36:04.334
Yeah, I don't know.

36:05.042 --> 36:06.751
If you give me one here...

36:09.542 --> 36:12.709
Yeah, right.
Like I'm your mom or something.

36:16.251 --> 36:18.876
- You were really scared back there.
- Me, scared?

36:19.334 --> 36:21.334
You took off like the Road Runner.

36:22.042 --> 36:25.292
- You squealed like a little girl. Ms. Macky.
- Ms. Macky?

36:25.459 --> 36:28.417
My butt. You're the one
who squealed like a little girl.

36:28.834 --> 36:31.084
Help, open up!
I'm scared!

36:32.709 --> 36:34.959
- Enough scaring people!
- Quiet.

36:35.626 --> 36:36.667
Do you hear that?

36:48.126 --> 36:49.792
Run, run!

37:01.834 --> 37:03.209
There he is!

37:06.251 --> 37:09.126
He's down!
Over there, come on!

37:18.334 --> 37:21.126
I'll catch you, you thieving monkey!

37:21.917 --> 37:24.209
It's Salomon.
Run or he'll catch you.

37:31.001 --> 37:32.834
Where? Where is he?

37:33.001 --> 37:35.251
They're coming! Run!

37:36.501 --> 37:38.126
Over there, let's go!

37:38.751 --> 37:40.542
Come on, hurry up!

37:40.709 --> 37:42.376
Run, quickly!

37:43.292 --> 37:44.792
Come on!

37:44.959 --> 37:47.626
Quickly!

37:52.376 --> 37:54.876
- Where is he?
- He was right here.

37:55.251 --> 37:57.417
He went down here, Miss Pam.

37:57.584 --> 38:00.501
- I'm sure of it.
- Come on, we have to catch him.

38:27.417 --> 38:29.584
You're really good at hiding.

38:37.751 --> 38:40.042
Wait, wait.

38:45.917 --> 38:49.126
I can't run anymore. That monkey
can eat me for all I care.

38:49.334 --> 38:51.417
What was that? An orangutan?

38:52.001 --> 38:53.542
No, it was a monkey.

38:53.709 --> 38:55.084
What's a gorilla doing here?

38:55.251 --> 38:56.667
It was a monkey, you boneheads.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.834
Hey, where's Flecky?

38:59.459 --> 39:01.667
I don't know. She's gone.

39:02.001 --> 39:04.709
- We have to find her.
- No, it's too dangerous.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.584
Besides, she's faster
than any of us anyway.

39:08.042 --> 39:10.459
Hey! That's my slingshot!

39:17.209 --> 39:18.792
Come on, let's go!

39:21.876 --> 39:23.334
Why do they want to kill you?

39:24.042 --> 39:25.334
You're not bad, are you?

39:27.626 --> 39:29.834
- There he is!
- Careful, you'll hit the girl!

39:31.251 --> 39:32.626
You almost killed her, you fool!

39:34.251 --> 39:35.292
- Go after him!
- Yes.

39:35.459 --> 39:36.709
Now!

39:39.459 --> 39:41.709
Are you all right, sweetie?

39:41.959 --> 39:44.001
- Did that horrible beast hurt you?
- No, no.

39:44.167 --> 39:47.167
He was protecting me.
And he understands what you say.

39:47.334 --> 39:50.126
Yes, he's very smart.
Too smart.

39:51.709 --> 39:53.751
So he was protecting you, huh?

39:54.084 --> 39:55.542
Well, we can't trust him.

39:55.709 --> 39:59.251
He's been sneaking into the house
and stealing anything he can find.

39:59.417 --> 40:01.792
What if he kidnaps one of you?

40:02.917 --> 40:05.417
I don't know what I would do
without you, my children.

40:06.459 --> 40:08.667
Nothing.
He made it into the woods.

40:09.667 --> 40:11.334
But he dropped this.

40:13.334 --> 40:16.292
- He's trying to get off the island...
- Shut up!

40:18.626 --> 40:20.334
I'll think of something

40:20.501 --> 40:22.626
tomorrow.

40:23.084 --> 40:24.626
Now let's go back inside.

40:24.792 --> 40:27.084
Come on, sweetie.

40:30.834 --> 40:31.959
Finally.

40:33.042 --> 40:34.501
Come to Daddy.

40:34.959 --> 40:36.792
How did this get here?

40:39.417 --> 40:41.667
I'm okay.
Everything's under control.

40:42.209 --> 40:44.001
What's cooking here?

40:44.292 --> 40:45.792
Holy cow!

40:46.542 --> 40:48.001
Wow!

40:49.459 --> 40:51.751
Salomon has quite a shop
going in here.

40:57.209 --> 40:59.042
Unbelievable.

41:00.417 --> 41:02.334
He's expecting a war.

41:14.126 --> 41:15.459
The guy likes to travel.

41:15.626 --> 41:17.542
Nice closet.

41:18.167 --> 41:19.292
Oh, okay.

41:20.126 --> 41:21.251
It's a disguise.

41:21.417 --> 41:24.626
- They're not his clothes, bonehead.
- Whose are they?

41:25.834 --> 41:26.959
Hey!

41:27.709 --> 41:28.876
They're Mom and Dad's.

41:29.251 --> 41:31.209
Look, Dad's briefcase!

41:31.751 --> 41:33.001
And his novel!

41:33.751 --> 41:35.709
You know what this means?

41:35.959 --> 41:39.167
- The dimwits forgot their luggage.
- They would never leave all this here.

41:39.334 --> 41:41.584
Dad took his novel everywhere with him.

41:41.751 --> 41:43.292
Don't make things up.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.292
They abandoned us here like dogs.

41:45.959 --> 41:48.584
After seeing this
you still believe that?

41:48.876 --> 41:50.501
Hey, check this out.

41:51.834 --> 41:53.417
This is crazy!

41:57.084 --> 41:59.751
Hey! That's from Dad's car.

41:59.917 --> 42:03.084
Well? You think they forgot
their license plate?

42:03.251 --> 42:06.709
No, Zap. Miss Pam lied to us.

42:07.001 --> 42:09.501
Mom and Dad didn't abandon us.

42:11.751 --> 42:13.709
They didn't abandon us.

42:16.334 --> 42:18.667
Then... they still love us?

42:19.751 --> 42:21.084
Of course they do!

42:22.292 --> 42:23.959
And we have to find them.

42:24.626 --> 42:25.542
Yeah.

42:26.042 --> 42:28.126
But where could they be?

42:30.042 --> 42:33.667
Well, boys, if that monkey
got them...

42:34.209 --> 42:36.084
chopped up in a ditch somewhere.

42:47.917 --> 42:49.292
Pippi.

42:49.459 --> 42:51.334
Come on, we have to tell you
something.

42:54.251 --> 42:56.459
You know what?
I'm not surprised.

42:57.084 --> 43:00.709
Weird things have been going on
here and they never tell us anything.

43:00.876 --> 43:03.251
Miss Pam is behind our parents
disappearing.

43:03.834 --> 43:05.334
We have to find out
what she's up to.

43:05.501 --> 43:07.501
No, we should try to escape.

43:08.042 --> 43:10.126
Crossing the forest, there's a town

43:10.292 --> 43:13.292
across the island.
We can go for help.

43:13.459 --> 43:14.834
Yeah, we'll tell the police.

43:15.251 --> 43:18.917
Police aren't cool, but I'm with...
What was your name, Four Eyes?

43:19.084 --> 43:19.709
Flecky.

43:19.959 --> 43:22.584
I'm with Four Eyes.
We should bring the cavalry.

43:23.084 --> 43:25.251
Okay, then.
We leave tonight.

43:25.417 --> 43:28.167
No. Crossing the woods
at night is too risky.

43:28.542 --> 43:30.751
And we need supplies.

43:31.001 --> 43:32.841
We'll leave tomorrow,
but at the crack of dawn.

43:32.959 --> 43:35.542
Dawn has a butt crack?

43:55.709 --> 43:56.917
Let's

43:58.792 --> 44:00.251
Quickly!

44:02.501 --> 44:04.751
What a sucker.
He had no clue.

44:07.001 --> 44:09.251
This is cause for celebration.

44:10.251 --> 44:12.001
- Gross!
- What a pig!

44:30.542 --> 44:33.251
- Where are you going?
- Quick, run!

44:33.417 --> 44:34.667
Let's

44:34.834 --> 44:35.792
Freeze!

44:38.417 --> 44:39.917
Come on, hurry!

44:42.334 --> 44:43.292
Come on, guys!

44:45.876 --> 44:47.001
Pippi!

44:47.167 --> 44:48.751
Quick, give me your hand!

44:48.917 --> 44:51.376
- Grab me!
- It hurts, I can't stand up!

44:51.542 --> 44:53.751
- Grab my hand!
- Hurry, Pippi! He's coming!

44:53.917 --> 44:56.459
- Pippi, grab my hand!
- No!

44:56.751 --> 44:58.042
You guys run!

44:58.209 --> 45:00.042
- Pippi, please!
- Let's go!

45:21.876 --> 45:22.876
Okay.

45:23.167 --> 45:24.292
- Let's stop.
- Yeah.

45:24.459 --> 45:26.167
Good idea.

45:26.334 --> 45:28.292
No danger. I'm dizzy.

45:29.042 --> 45:30.376
Poor Pippi.

45:30.542 --> 45:32.542
- I blew it.
- Yeah.

45:33.459 --> 45:36.084
Leaving her behind
wasn't very nice.

45:39.542 --> 45:42.667
But at least you tried.

45:43.334 --> 45:44.709
You want to help her?

45:44.876 --> 45:48.251
Then keep walking until you reach
the police station and come back

45:48.417 --> 45:49.751
in a patrol car.

45:49.917 --> 45:51.251
That's what I'm going to do.

45:53.792 --> 45:55.251
Flecky, Flecky.

45:55.834 --> 45:57.542
That's the way back to the mansion.

46:00.084 --> 46:02.459
Then that's not the way to go.

46:07.167 --> 46:09.792
Come on, guys.
We have to save Pippi,

46:09.959 --> 46:11.417
find your parents

46:11.584 --> 46:13.959
and stop that damn asteroid
from hitting the Earth!

46:16.459 --> 46:19.709
Okay, that last part
was a little extra motivation.

46:19.876 --> 46:21.376
But that would be cool, huh?

46:22.251 --> 46:23.167
Come on, let's go.

46:50.126 --> 46:53.167
Hey, cool. This tree is even nicer
than the last one.

46:53.334 --> 46:56.042
- I'd say it's the same tree.
- Let me see.

46:57.292 --> 46:59.501
Confirmed, we came through here
already.

46:59.834 --> 47:02.667
- Tom Thumb is leaving clues.
- What?

47:02.834 --> 47:06.167
Thanks to me, we know
where we are. Lost!

47:07.709 --> 47:09.292
If only we had a compass.

47:09.459 --> 47:11.751
I don't need a compass.

47:12.001 --> 47:15.042
The forest talks to me
and tells me which way to go.

47:21.709 --> 47:25.126
Follow the moon, Four Eyes.

47:25.584 --> 47:28.501
Go home.

47:28.667 --> 47:30.459
Come on, it's getting dark.

47:37.709 --> 47:39.542
Hey, move your butt.

48:01.542 --> 48:03.917
We'll sleep in this clearing, okay?

48:09.959 --> 48:12.876
We're going to sleep here?
In the woods?

48:13.334 --> 48:16.209
- Got any better ideas?
- No.

48:26.542 --> 48:27.709
What's wrong with you?

48:28.126 --> 48:29.792
You keep turning your head
like an owl.

48:30.167 --> 48:31.709
Huh? No, nothing.

48:32.292 --> 48:33.334
I'm fine.

48:38.667 --> 48:41.834
Are you cold?
Here, take my blanket.

48:42.417 --> 48:44.792
Thanks, Zip.
That's nice of you.

48:45.542 --> 48:48.126
Here, take mine. It's warmer.

48:56.751 --> 49:00.042
Are you going to tell me
what's wrong?

49:04.584 --> 49:05.876
<i>I...</i>

49:08.376 --> 49:11.001
- I need to pee.
- That's all the mystery?

49:11.167 --> 49:13.251
Just go over there and take a leak.

49:17.334 --> 49:18.667
It's just that...

49:19.542 --> 49:20.834
it's dark...

49:21.334 --> 49:23.334
and not cool at all.

49:30.376 --> 49:31.959
Look.

49:33.542 --> 49:35.959
Boys' bathroom, girls' bathroom.

49:36.626 --> 49:38.667
Anyone else need to go?

49:46.459 --> 49:47.626
Okay, go ahead.

49:48.334 --> 49:49.751
Pick a tree.

49:59.417 --> 50:01.917
Do you mind?
I can't with someone watching.

50:19.334 --> 50:20.667
What's wrong?

50:21.334 --> 50:22.876
There's something over there!

50:23.042 --> 50:25.917
- Did an animal attack you?
- Over there, by the tree.

50:26.084 --> 50:29.751
There's someone there.
He said, "Hey!"

50:30.459 --> 50:32.167
Take it easy. You're tired.

50:32.334 --> 50:33.667
Yeah. We'd better get some sleep.

50:33.834 --> 50:36.709
Sleep? No way.
I'm not closing my eyes.

50:36.876 --> 50:39.042
That thing is out there somewhere.

50:39.209 --> 50:41.834
- I don't know where.
- Macky, calm down.

50:42.001 --> 50:43.501
Go to sleep, I'll stand guard.

50:43.667 --> 50:44.834
I will too.

50:45.042 --> 50:46.042
So will I.

50:47.376 --> 50:49.001
I mean sleep.

50:49.334 --> 50:51.084
I don't see myself as a guard.

50:51.584 --> 50:52.667
Maybe a fireman.

51:29.167 --> 51:31.417
I hope they're okay.

51:32.501 --> 51:35.084
Sure they are.
They can take care of themselves.

51:35.751 --> 51:38.084
Mom and Dad don't need anyone
to tuck them in.

51:56.834 --> 51:59.001
We can hardly follow the sun...

52:01.834 --> 52:03.834
Watch out, clumsy boy.

52:04.209 --> 52:07.626
Keep your eyes peeled, Pink Floyd.
Watch your step.

52:10.626 --> 52:12.292
Watch out!

52:19.126 --> 52:21.376
You were saying, Pink Floyd?

52:22.084 --> 52:22.984
Okay.

52:23.126 --> 52:25.751
- On three we kick our way out.
- Three!

52:41.251 --> 52:42.417
The gorilla!

52:42.584 --> 52:44.209
Holy cow!
Run for the trees!

52:44.376 --> 52:47.251
No, wait. We're saved.

52:48.167 --> 52:51.167
Hi, Mr. Gorilla.
Can you help us get out of here?

52:51.334 --> 52:53.001
Come on, he's a monkey.

52:53.251 --> 52:54.971
Monkeys are stupid.
He can't understand you.

52:57.376 --> 53:00.709
Then you must speak the same language,
because he understood you.

53:12.959 --> 53:15.292
Great. He's going to steal
our sandwiches.

53:17.751 --> 53:20.209
That's it, cut the rope!

53:20.376 --> 53:23.126
He's a monkey.
How will he open the knife?

53:23.584 --> 53:25.917
Maybe if he were a circus monkey...

53:27.459 --> 53:30.917
Oh. Maybe he is a circus monkey.

53:52.084 --> 53:53.834
Thank you very much, Mr. Gorilla.

54:06.667 --> 54:08.834
I think he wants us to go with him.

54:09.292 --> 54:12.001
He's a monkey!
What are you talking about?

54:20.417 --> 54:22.959
Okay, boys.
We have a compass now.

55:23.292 --> 55:25.042
Who do you think made this raft?

55:26.459 --> 55:28.417
What a smart gorilla.

55:30.792 --> 55:32.292
He says he's going to sail away.

55:32.459 --> 55:35.167
Salomon said he was trying

55:35.334 --> 55:37.167
to escape.

55:42.167 --> 55:44.917
Look, what are those things?

56:25.334 --> 56:27.209
No wonder they want to catch him.

56:27.376 --> 56:29.792
He's a kleptomaniac.

56:36.834 --> 56:38.876
What? It's a gift for Flecky.

56:40.751 --> 56:42.417
Zip, Zap, come and see this!

56:49.459 --> 56:50.417
GAME OF VANDALS

56:50.584 --> 56:52.167
Holy guacamole!

56:52.417 --> 56:53.792
What's this doing here?

57:00.542 --> 57:02.792
Definitely a circus gorilla.

57:05.834 --> 57:07.834
Look! That's Sister Enriqueta.

57:08.584 --> 57:11.001
“Demented nun escapes from
psychiatric hospital."

57:11.417 --> 57:13.042
"Ruthless animal trafficker

57:13.209 --> 57:15.709
disappears mysteriously from prison."

57:15.876 --> 57:17.376
That's Salomon.

57:17.542 --> 57:19.959
"The search for Detective Holgado
continues."

57:21.292 --> 57:22.334
Who's that?

57:31.834 --> 57:34.959
Look!
Mr. Gorilla is Detective Holgado!

57:35.542 --> 57:37.042
Why are you a gorilla?

57:39.167 --> 57:41.626
What a crackpot.
He says Peter Pan did that to him.

57:41.792 --> 57:44.084
And Bambi does my hair.

57:44.285 --> 57:45.185
No, no, no.

57:45.209 --> 57:46.959
He means Miss Pam.

57:50.917 --> 57:53.417
Zap! Remember what Dad said?

57:53.792 --> 57:55.334
These are all literary characters.

57:55.501 --> 57:57.334
Miss Pam must have brought them here

57:57.501 --> 57:59.501
because they're like characters
from novels.

57:59.667 --> 58:01.792
She's starting a collection!

58:02.417 --> 58:04.709
Of course!
And she's Peter Pan!

58:06.542 --> 58:09.001
Then who are we?

58:09.167 --> 58:11.292
If I'm Peter Pan,

58:11.459 --> 58:14.917
you, my darlings,
are my lost children.

58:21.751 --> 58:23.834
- They followed us.
- No.

58:24.209 --> 58:26.251
You were escorted by someone
more discreet.

58:26.417 --> 58:28.376
You call him the ghost.

58:28.709 --> 58:31.001
But in my collection he's...

58:31.542 --> 58:33.292
the Invisible Man.

58:38.042 --> 58:40.167
- Come in here, you idiot!
- Now?

58:40.459 --> 58:41.792
I'm coming.

58:41.959 --> 58:44.792
Miss Pam, these clothes

58:44.959 --> 58:48.209
are very uncomfortable.
I'd rather be naked.

58:48.376 --> 58:49.667
Where are our parents?

58:49.834 --> 58:51.626
We know they didn't abandon us.

58:51.792 --> 58:53.667
What did you do to them?

58:54.626 --> 58:56.042
Take them back to the mansion.

58:56.417 --> 58:59.667
Gather everything
and burn the raft.

59:18.167 --> 59:20.959
- Why the long faces?
- Because we're sick of you.

59:21.126 --> 59:22.834
What have you done
to Macky and Flecky?

59:23.001 --> 59:24.459
They're fine, don't worry.

59:24.876 --> 59:26.751
It's nice to see that
you've become friends.

59:27.251 --> 59:29.209
- That's what I wished for.
- And our parents?

59:29.376 --> 59:31.042
Give us back our parents right now!

59:31.209 --> 59:33.459
That's going to be a problem.

59:34.084 --> 59:36.334
Either fun friends
or pestering parents,

59:36.501 --> 59:38.126
but you can't have both.

59:55.584 --> 59:57.167
What do you think?

01:00:01.876 --> 01:00:03.792
Mom! Dad!

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:05.751
Mom! Dad!

01:00:06.251 --> 01:00:08.792
- We have to open this!
- Don't worry, we'll get you out!

01:00:09.292 --> 01:00:10.959
Open up, damn it!

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:13.417
Dad! Mom!

01:00:20.334 --> 01:00:22.167
What are you doing?
Stop this thing!

01:00:22.334 --> 01:00:25.209
Boys... It's time to choose.

01:00:33.334 --> 01:00:35.126
- Mom! Dad!
- Please, stop!

01:00:35.292 --> 01:00:37.001
Don't hurt them!

01:00:37.626 --> 01:00:39.834
Noooo!

01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:13.459
Say hi to your friends.

01:01:13.876 --> 01:01:15.626
Where are our parents?

01:01:15.792 --> 01:01:17.584
Right there. Like I said.

01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:19.667
Either pestering parents
or fun friends.

01:01:19.834 --> 01:01:23.876
And who wants bossy parents
when you can have fun with your friends?

01:01:24.042 --> 01:01:25.959
We do. Give us back our parents.

01:01:26.126 --> 01:01:28.126
They may be pests,
but they're our pests!

01:01:28.292 --> 01:01:29.667
Really?

01:01:31.376 --> 01:01:34.667
No, you can't choose
such horrible parents.

01:01:35.251 --> 01:01:37.834
They punished you
and made your life miserable.

01:01:38.001 --> 01:01:39.751
So what?
It was for our own good.

01:01:39.917 --> 01:01:40.876
That's a lie!

01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:44.584
What's good about punishing you
with no Christmas?

01:01:46.292 --> 01:01:47.626
Oh, my boys.

01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:51.042
Parents never do anything
to help their kids.

01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:54.834
They're only trying to satisfy
their own frustration. Besides,

01:01:55.459 --> 01:01:57.626
they always break their promises
in the end.

01:01:58.667 --> 01:02:00.084
Okay, so they aren't perfect.

01:02:00.376 --> 01:02:02.251
But you know what
they're really good at?

01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:05.792
- Being our parents!
- And that's worth 5 zillion Christmas'.

01:02:06.626 --> 01:02:09.001
It's obvious you never had
parents to raise you...

01:02:09.376 --> 01:02:11.584
and to say no to you
every now and then.

01:02:11.751 --> 01:02:13.251
I did have someone to raise me.

01:02:13.417 --> 01:02:16.209
Who, him? Give me a break.
A butler

01:02:16.376 --> 01:02:18.792
serves you like a dog.
That's not a parent.

01:02:20.001 --> 01:02:22.542
What a disappointment.

01:02:23.084 --> 01:02:26.126
And I thought you'd be
the prize of my collection.

01:02:26.501 --> 01:02:30.001
But that's all right.
I can wait forever.

01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:33.167
And I always get what I want.

01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:36.084
That's what makes me... Peter Pan.

01:02:36.251 --> 01:02:38.584
Actually, Peter Pan was a boy.

01:02:38.751 --> 01:02:40.584
A boy who didn't want to grow up.

01:02:40.751 --> 01:02:43.501
Exactly, my dear. Just like me.

01:03:03.667 --> 01:03:06.917
Emoclew, my friends!
Who wants to play a game?

01:03:07.209 --> 01:03:11.042
We can hunt a ghost,
run away from the mansion,

01:03:11.209 --> 01:03:12.751
or fall into Salomon's trap.

01:03:13.709 --> 01:03:15.917
Nothing? You don't feel like

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.584
Playing anything?

01:03:17.917 --> 01:03:19.834
Then you're all grounded!

01:03:23.959 --> 01:03:25.417
I told you.

01:03:26.001 --> 01:03:27.542
That girl is a wacko.

01:03:43.292 --> 01:03:44.959
Have they said anything, Four Eyes?

01:03:47.376 --> 01:03:48.834
What's wrong, you guys?

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:53.292
Did Pam... I mean Pippi...
that lunatic say where your parents are?

01:03:56.626 --> 01:03:59.626
Zip, are you mad at me?

01:04:21.876 --> 01:04:23.501
Why did she turn him
into a gorilla?

01:04:27.459 --> 01:04:30.001
Miss Pam tricked him
into coming here

01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:33.167
so he could be the Sherlock Holmes
of her collection,

01:04:34.001 --> 01:04:35.584
but he tried to escape.

01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:38.876
To mock him,
Pam turned him into a gorilla.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:40.667
What will happen to him now?

01:04:41.417 --> 01:04:44.292
What happens to anyone who
doesn't comply with her wishes.

01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:46.417
She's tired of him.

01:04:46.626 --> 01:04:48.917
She'll turn him into something
more docile.

01:04:56.501 --> 01:04:58.792
What you said yesterday...

01:05:00.084 --> 01:05:02.042
Do you really miss your parents?

01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:05.376
- Of course we do!
- We'd never give them up.

01:05:05.542 --> 01:05:08.959
And their rules, their punishment?

01:05:09.126 --> 01:05:11.042
They're parents.
What can we do?

01:05:12.584 --> 01:05:14.501
Remember when we got the measles?

01:05:14.917 --> 01:05:17.417
Dad made us wear kitchen mitts
so we couldn't

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:18.667
scratch ourselves.

01:05:18.834 --> 01:05:22.167
He stayed up all night,
fell out of the chair

01:05:22.334 --> 01:05:24.042
and whacked his head.

01:05:24.209 --> 01:05:25.876
What a bonehead.

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:29.917
I don't want to have kids.

01:05:30.084 --> 01:05:33.292
And if I did, I wouldn't let them do
anything they want.

01:05:33.459 --> 01:05:35.251
And if they get mad at me, fine!

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:37.459
It's better than being
a yo-yo mom.

01:05:39.751 --> 01:05:41.126
A cool mom.

01:05:41.667 --> 01:05:43.417
My parents are a drag.

01:05:43.584 --> 01:05:47.292
But hey, they're my parents.
They grow on you.

01:05:52.292 --> 01:05:55.542
You're not happy here either.
I can tell.

01:05:55.709 --> 01:05:56.876
Pam doesn't treat you well.

01:05:57.292 --> 01:05:59.251
Help us and run away with us.

01:05:59.584 --> 01:06:01.464
There must be someone
waiting for you somewhere.

01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:02.876
No...

01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:06.042
I lost my home a long time ago.

01:06:07.417 --> 01:06:08.459
And my family.

01:06:09.667 --> 01:06:10.792
It was Pam, wasn't it?

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:13.876
No.

01:06:14.542 --> 01:06:16.084
It wasn't her.

01:06:24.292 --> 01:06:25.917
Her father...

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:29.042
was to blame.

01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:36.417
<i>Once upon a time
there was a wonderful island</i>

01:06:36.584 --> 01:06:38.667
<i>where a little girl named Pamela</i>

01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:41.334
<i>lived in a world of happiness.</i>

01:06:42.167 --> 01:06:44.209
<i>Her father, who everyone called</i>

01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:45.709
<i>the Captain,</i>

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:48.626
<i>was a brilliant naval engineer.</i>

01:06:49.167 --> 01:06:52.376
<i>Her mother would read the little girl
a book every night.</i>

01:06:52.667 --> 01:06:54.501
<i>And she would always say...</i>

01:06:54.751 --> 01:06:57.376
<i>"Life is the novel that we live.</i>

01:06:57.542 --> 01:07:01.501
<i>And you, my little Pamela,
can be any character you want."</i>

01:07:02.584 --> 01:07:06.709
<i>But one day, her mother got sick
and her world of happiness</i>

01:07:07.584 --> 01:07:09.584
<i>was shattered forever.</i>

01:07:12.126 --> 01:07:15.376
<i>Haunted by guilt,
the Captain decided</i>

01:07:15.542 --> 01:07:18.667
<i>to dedicate his life
to building a new world</i>

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:22.376
<i>for his daughter free of bad things</i>

01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:24.042
<i>and sadness.</i>

01:07:24.751 --> 01:07:27.042
<i>Anything Pamela dreamed of having,</i>

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.792
<i>the Captain always answered:</i>

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:33.417
“Yes, <i>my darling,
I will build it for you."</i>

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.667
<i>One night, while she was dreaming,</i>

01:07:36.834 --> 01:07:38.959
<i>the little girl remembered:</i>

01:07:39.126 --> 01:07:41.334
<i>Life is the novel we live.</i>

01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:45.292
<i>And you, my little Pamela,
can be any character you want.</i>

01:07:45.667 --> 01:07:48.584
<i>To the girl, her father
was Captain Nemo,</i>

01:07:48.751 --> 01:07:52.667
a <i>fearless sailor,
but who could she be?</i>

01:07:53.501 --> 01:07:55.709
<i>She read hundreds of books
without resting</i>

01:07:55.876 --> 01:07:59.251
<i>until she finally found her character.</i>

01:07:59.917 --> 01:08:02.001
<i>Pamela didn't want to get old
and die</i>

01:08:02.167 --> 01:08:03.417
<i>like her mother.</i>

01:08:03.584 --> 01:08:05.792
<i>She wanted to be like Peter Pan.</i>

01:08:05.959 --> 01:08:08.751
<i>So she asked for a machine
to stop her from growing up.</i>

01:08:09.542 --> 01:08:11.626
<i>And the Captain answered:</i>

01:08:11.792 --> 01:08:15.584
“Yes, <i>my darling,
I will build it for you."</i>

01:08:16.167 --> 01:08:19.126
<i>But after working a whole year
without resting,</i>

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:23.751
<i>the effects of the machine
only worked while inside the capsule.</i>

01:08:24.459 --> 01:08:27.709
<i>Days and seasons passed...</i>

01:08:27.876 --> 01:08:30.167
<i>and the little girl became a woman.</i>

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:33.834
<i>And her love for her father
turned into hate.</i>

01:08:34.751 --> 01:08:37.126
<i>But the Captain kept trying,</i>

01:08:37.292 --> 01:08:40.209
<i>no matter what the price.</i>

01:08:42.126 --> 01:08:44.167
<i>Until finally, one night...</i>

01:08:44.334 --> 01:08:48.459
<i>he discovered the way
to make his daughter's wish come true.</i>

01:09:02.459 --> 01:09:06.209
<i>Before entering the machine,
the Captain asked his daughter to erase</i>

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:10.084
<i>her memories and all of those
years of disappointment,</i>

01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:13.001
<i>but she wasn't willing to forget.</i>

01:09:13.626 --> 01:09:15.209
<i>For little Pamela,</i>

01:09:15.376 --> 01:09:18.001
<i>her father wasn't Captain Nemo
anymore.</i>

01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:22.626
<i>Now he was Captain Hook,
Peter Pan's eternal enemy.</i>

01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:27.751
<i>And the Captain realized that it was
his fault that she had drifted off course</i>

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:33.001
<i>into a capricious world,
catered to her every whim.</i>

01:09:36.417 --> 01:09:37.751
I can't leave

01:09:38.417 --> 01:09:40.501
and abandon my daughter.

01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:45.709
This has always been my home.

01:09:45.876 --> 01:09:49.167
Couldn't you have just given her
a doll or something?

01:09:49.626 --> 01:09:53.667
Okay, you can't leave. But you can help us
get our parents back, can't you?

01:09:54.084 --> 01:09:55.126
No.

01:09:55.667 --> 01:09:56.584
Not anymore.

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:58.792
I would need a photo of them.

01:09:58.959 --> 01:10:00.292
And Pam burned them.

01:10:00.459 --> 01:10:02.917
Can't we unplug that machine
or something?

01:10:03.084 --> 01:10:05.709
To reverse the effects
of the transformation,

01:10:05.876 --> 01:10:08.542
you'd have to destroy the dome
surrounding the island.

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:12.626
The only way to do that
is by breaking the snow globe.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:15.584
That's the mechanism
that keeps it active.

01:10:16.501 --> 01:10:19.917
Okay, where is it?
I'll shatter that thing no problem.

01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:21.792
Pam took it from me years ago.

01:10:21.959 --> 01:10:23.542
I never found out where she put it.

01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:29.417
Hey, cheer up.
There must be another way

01:10:29.584 --> 01:10:31.251
to get your parents back.

01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:33.251
There is.

01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:35.209
Yes, there is!

01:10:36.084 --> 01:10:37.834
I built it so long ago

01:10:38.459 --> 01:10:40.126
that I almost forgot.

01:10:40.501 --> 01:10:42.084
You built what?

01:10:50.751 --> 01:10:53.334
Hurry, you must go
and tell the police.

01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:57.417
- Not the woods again!
- No, you'll flee by sea.

01:10:57.959 --> 01:10:59.209
In my ship.

01:11:00.042 --> 01:11:01.917
Quickly, open the cell.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:05.042
Free the gorilla.

01:11:06.667 --> 01:11:09.167
All you have to do is cross
the perimeter of buoys.

01:11:09.334 --> 01:11:13.542
Once you're across,
the machine will lose its effect

01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:15.709
and you'll have your parents back.

01:11:15.876 --> 01:11:17.417
Okay. Where's the ship?

01:11:17.584 --> 01:11:19.667
The elevator will take you to it.

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:22.501
But you need a key to make it work.

01:11:22.667 --> 01:11:25.751
Pam took it from me as well.
She split it in two

01:11:26.042 --> 01:11:28.626
and gave each part
to a different person.

01:11:28.792 --> 01:11:32.001
- Who has the key?
- Salomon and Sister Enriqueta.

01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:34.376
There's the problem.

01:11:38.251 --> 01:11:40.834
Come on, we need to find
somewhere to hide you.

01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:19.917
Grab here.

01:12:23.126 --> 01:12:24.542
Does it hurt?

01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:27.126
If you want

01:12:27.459 --> 01:12:30.417
I can give you a loving kiss
to wash away the pain.

01:12:30.584 --> 01:12:34.126
No, I'm fine.
Come on, we have a lot to do.

01:12:51.917 --> 01:12:53.292
Come on...

01:12:54.251 --> 01:12:55.251
Hold still.

01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:15.459
Oh! Little chicks...

01:13:15.626 --> 01:13:17.917
How clumsy of me.

01:13:30.167 --> 01:13:31.792
Don't screw this up, Dad.

01:14:18.042 --> 01:14:19.667
It must be around here somewhere.

01:14:21.001 --> 01:14:22.501
You don't like me anymore?

01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:25.167
Huh? No, no. I mean, yeah.

01:14:25.334 --> 01:14:27.751
It's just that... I'm worried.
We need to find it

01:14:27.917 --> 01:14:29.834
and Zap has to be on target...

01:14:30.001 --> 01:14:32.792
And let's not forget Macky.
He'll probably screw up.

01:14:32.959 --> 01:14:36.376
Relax. If you worry about everything,
you won't enjoy anything.

01:14:36.959 --> 01:14:38.084
What...?

01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:39.876
Shh. It's a secret.

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:44.459
So do you still like me or not?

01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:48.334
Yeah, of course I do.

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:51.792
It's just that...
Well, you remind me of someone.

01:14:53.001 --> 01:14:54.251
Who?

01:14:54.917 --> 01:14:58.334
My... mother?

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:06.167
His mother?

01:15:58.042 --> 01:15:59.626
- I got it!
- You got it!

01:16:02.584 --> 01:16:03.834
Let's

01:16:15.292 --> 01:16:16.917
Where are they?

01:16:19.667 --> 01:16:21.792
It doesn't matter.
They won't get far.

01:16:22.209 --> 01:16:24.042
I told them everything.

01:16:25.542 --> 01:16:28.042
Even about the snow globe.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:30.459
So what?

01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:33.084
You don't know where it is.

01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:36.626
What am I going to do with you...

01:16:37.959 --> 01:16:38.959
father?

01:17:16.501 --> 01:17:17.709
What the...?

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:20.626
Thieving demon!

01:17:22.251 --> 01:17:24.167
- Come here!
- Coming through!

01:17:24.334 --> 01:17:26.334
What are you doing?

01:17:37.876 --> 01:17:40.292
Time for your punishment, darling.

01:17:40.501 --> 01:17:43.667
You've been a very bad father.

01:17:43.834 --> 01:17:45.876
Yes, I have.

01:17:47.126 --> 01:17:49.584
Because I never said no
to my daughter.

01:17:49.751 --> 01:17:50.651
Oh! yeah?

01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:52.501
Is that the only reason?

01:17:54.792 --> 01:17:57.042
What about all the years
I spent waiting?

01:17:57.209 --> 01:18:00.542
And all the broken promises?

01:18:01.584 --> 01:18:04.917
- I didn't want to grow up!
- Pamela,

01:18:05.084 --> 01:18:08.709
sweetheart, put an end to all this.

01:18:09.501 --> 01:18:11.376
I promise I'll be a good father.

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:13.376
It's too late.

01:18:15.626 --> 01:18:19.001
Besides, I never wanted a father.

01:18:19.917 --> 01:18:22.626
But guess what Pippi's
always wanted.

01:18:32.584 --> 01:18:34.334
A little frog!

01:18:36.584 --> 01:18:38.084
Well? Did you get it?

01:18:38.251 --> 01:18:40.334
Was there any doubt, super freak?

01:18:45.376 --> 01:18:46.376
It's an anchor.

01:18:46.917 --> 01:18:50.167
See you later, chumps!
Catch me if you can!

01:18:50.834 --> 01:18:52.501
Oh, wait!
You can't see me!

01:18:53.959 --> 01:18:58.584
<i>Ow, my hand! My hand!
Let me go!</i>

01:18:58.751 --> 01:19:00.751
Let me go, you beast!

01:19:16.584 --> 01:19:18.626
Hi, Daddy!

01:19:21.292 --> 01:19:24.084
You know what?
I'm going to call you Secrets.

01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:26.459
Because you're going
to keep one for me.

01:19:26.626 --> 01:19:29.501
It's big, round and has snow inside.

01:19:29.667 --> 01:19:31.126
But I'll only tell you

01:19:31.292 --> 01:19:33.001
if you promise not to tell anyone.

01:19:33.834 --> 01:19:35.584
Do you promise, Secrets?

01:19:40.792 --> 01:19:44.251
Congratulations, Detective Holgado.
You caught the ghost.

01:19:47.084 --> 01:19:50.126
Guess what they called me
at the loony bin.

01:19:50.292 --> 01:19:51.376
Twisted...

01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:53.151
Sister.

01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:56.292
Okay, little chicks.
Who wants to sing a song?

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.376
See if this guy does, Batman.

01:20:16.292 --> 01:20:17.834
Quick, to the elevator!

01:20:18.001 --> 01:20:19.292
Run!

01:20:20.626 --> 01:20:22.001
Open the door!

01:20:33.042 --> 01:20:35.001
Now what do we do?

01:20:37.584 --> 01:20:38.484
Hey.

01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:40.584
The lock is shaped like an anchor.

01:21:23.501 --> 01:21:26.209
We're sinking, we're sinking!

01:21:27.126 --> 01:21:29.376
We're sinking!

01:21:29.542 --> 01:21:32.084
Chill out, man.
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

01:21:45.542 --> 01:21:46.792
What is this thing?

01:22:06.459 --> 01:22:08.667
You guys, this isn't an elevator...

01:22:09.876 --> 01:22:10.959
It's a submarine!

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:13.876
I finally got my
remote-controlled submarine!

01:22:14.042 --> 01:22:17.084
You can pilot from over there,
because I'm driving.

01:22:17.251 --> 01:22:19.751
- No way. I've wanted one for 3 years!
- Step aside, pinhead!

01:22:19.917 --> 01:22:21.042
- Forget it.
- Let me drive!

01:22:21.417 --> 01:22:22.626
That's enough!

01:22:23.126 --> 01:22:25.167
I'm sick of you both!

01:22:25.334 --> 01:22:27.667
No more fighting, you got it?

01:22:40.667 --> 01:22:42.626
You naughty little frog.

01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:45.459
I can't believe you gave them
your little boat.

01:23:07.126 --> 01:23:09.209
Hey, there's something down there.

01:23:11.334 --> 01:23:13.292
She's right. Turn around!

01:23:19.459 --> 01:23:20.501
But...

01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:22.084
what is that?

01:23:55.876 --> 01:23:57.667
Look, you guys. The buoys!

01:24:00.251 --> 01:24:01.501
We're almost there.

01:24:03.292 --> 01:24:04.459
What happened?

01:24:05.751 --> 01:24:07.084
It stopped!

01:24:13.292 --> 01:24:14.542
We're going backwards!

01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:16.042
Something is dragging us!

01:24:20.417 --> 01:24:21.792
Whoa... What is that?

01:24:22.876 --> 01:24:25.209
We need light.
Quick, turn around!

01:24:52.542 --> 01:24:54.542
What a surprise,
finding you down here!

01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:56.876
- Going for a ride?
- No.

01:24:57.042 --> 01:24:58.626
We're leaving your stinky island.

01:24:58.792 --> 01:25:01.417
That's too bad.
But that's not going to happen.

01:25:01.584 --> 01:25:05.459
I decide who leaves.
And I decide...

01:25:05.626 --> 01:25:07.709
- that nobody does.
- Look, princess.

01:25:07.876 --> 01:25:11.042
You and your fried calamari
can take a hike. Hit it, partner.

01:25:13.126 --> 01:25:15.334
It's an octupus, you pea brain.

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:33.209
Well? Do you feel like
coming home with me now?

01:25:35.417 --> 01:25:36.584
This must shoot something.

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:41.667
Hey, wacko!
How about a calamari brochette!

01:25:46.501 --> 01:25:48.542
Quick, turn around!
Let's get out of here!

01:26:00.167 --> 01:26:02.542
I said it's an octopus!

01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:09.501
Hold your breath, guys.
This is going to get tight.

01:26:15.001 --> 01:26:16.251
It's going to crush us!

01:26:21.626 --> 01:26:24.917
Pippi, stop! We give up!
Please, stop!

01:26:25.084 --> 01:26:28.751
Too late, my darlings.
I'm tired of playing with you.

01:26:38.834 --> 01:26:41.167
See you never, my friends!

01:26:50.292 --> 01:26:52.876
We're sinking!
We have to cover the hole!

01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:55.001
For God's sake, start!

01:27:21.126 --> 01:27:22.917
How are we going to get out of here?

01:27:24.542 --> 01:27:26.542
- We're going to drown.
- Don't say that.

01:27:26.917 --> 01:27:29.167
I'll think of something.
There must be a way.

01:27:29.334 --> 01:27:30.959
Not this time, Zip.

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:38.001
Hey, what's with the crying?

01:27:38.792 --> 01:27:40.959
You're the bravest rooster
in the henhouse.

01:27:41.834 --> 01:27:43.126
Am I right?

01:27:50.417 --> 01:27:53.251
A kiss won't wash this away.

01:27:59.667 --> 01:28:00.709
Here.

01:28:01.334 --> 01:28:03.292
I took it to give it to my mother.

01:28:04.542 --> 01:28:06.126
She would have loved it.

01:28:06.792 --> 01:28:09.084
She always wanted us
to follow the right path.

01:28:09.459 --> 01:28:10.584
And, well,

01:28:11.792 --> 01:28:13.126
for us...

01:28:16.126 --> 01:28:18.376
you were the best path.

01:29:01.376 --> 01:29:02.626
Are we dead?

01:29:04.959 --> 01:29:05.859
No!

01:29:06.084 --> 01:29:08.126
We're alive! Alive!

01:29:08.626 --> 01:29:09.709
What happened?

01:29:09.876 --> 01:29:12.042
It was like we were teletransported.

01:29:12.417 --> 01:29:14.084
Of course!
It was the compass!

01:29:14.251 --> 01:29:17.376
When we hugged I must have
pressed this button!

01:29:19.709 --> 01:29:22.209
Press it again!

01:29:26.209 --> 01:29:29.167
Put the compass in your pocket.
We don't want any more trouble.

01:29:43.751 --> 01:29:46.167
Look who had my compass.

01:29:46.334 --> 01:29:49.376
My father gave it to me
for my 9th birthday.

01:29:49.792 --> 01:29:51.751
You should thank him.

01:29:51.917 --> 01:29:54.292
By the way, where is he?

01:29:55.542 --> 01:29:57.209
There he is!

01:29:57.584 --> 01:30:00.084
How do you like his new look?

01:30:00.251 --> 01:30:01.876
Pretty jumpy...

01:30:02.042 --> 01:30:03.084
for his age.

01:30:03.251 --> 01:30:05.584
- Grab those two!
- Everybody freeze!

01:30:05.751 --> 01:30:08.334
Move a muscle and I'll use
your heads as a nutcracker.

01:30:08.751 --> 01:30:11.209
Okay, my friends.
What do I do with you now?

01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:20.376
Let's see...
What would I like to have?

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:25.459
Oh, no.
No more annoying monkeys.

01:30:26.626 --> 01:30:28.876
I know! A flea circus!

01:30:29.084 --> 01:30:31.542
I've always wanted a flea circus.

01:30:32.001 --> 01:30:33.417
To squash it!

01:30:33.584 --> 01:30:35.626
- Pippi, please. Don't hurt them.
- Silence!

01:30:41.876 --> 01:30:42.776
No...

01:30:42.917 --> 01:30:44.417
Where is he going?

01:30:48.834 --> 01:30:51.126
Holy cow!
The snow globe!

01:30:52.751 --> 01:30:55.626
- Stop him!
- Come here, Satan!

01:31:05.876 --> 01:31:07.709
Hit it, Zap!

01:31:09.501 --> 01:31:10.667
Nooooo!

01:31:16.876 --> 01:31:18.209
Yes!

01:31:19.167 --> 01:31:20.334
Nice.

01:32:46.792 --> 01:32:49.167
Snow! Snow!

01:32:50.167 --> 01:32:51.542
Snow! Snow!

01:32:52.792 --> 01:32:54.751
Snow!

01:33:08.376 --> 01:33:10.209
Mom! Dad!

01:33:10.376 --> 01:33:11.542
- Alisa!
- Sweetheart!

01:33:52.501 --> 01:33:54.001
My globe...

01:33:55.084 --> 01:33:56.209
My little globe.

01:33:58.042 --> 01:34:00.584
What have you done?

01:34:34.751 --> 01:34:36.084
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:34:36.626 --> 01:34:38.251
Your father is here.

01:34:47.834 --> 01:34:50.084
Miss Pam, you have to come with me.

01:34:58.459 --> 01:35:00.126
Good work, boys.

01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:05.001
Hello, little chick.

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:07.501
Let's go.

01:35:08.792 --> 01:35:12.042
I think it's time to find
your parents,

01:35:12.834 --> 01:35:14.667
lost children.

01:35:17.084 --> 01:35:18.417
Thank you, Captain.

01:35:41.751 --> 01:35:43.209
What happened out there?

01:35:43.376 --> 01:35:46.584
Where's Pippi? And Sister Enriqueta?
Did we win?

01:35:48.001 --> 01:35:49.417
We won.

01:35:49.876 --> 01:35:52.209
Then... we're going home?

01:35:52.834 --> 01:35:54.959
We all have parents to put up with.

01:35:59.876 --> 01:36:01.667
You're a good man, Pink Floyd.

01:36:02.167 --> 01:36:05.626
Now I know you give me such
a hard time because you love me.

01:36:05.917 --> 01:36:07.209
Don't get all mushy on me.

01:36:07.417 --> 01:36:10.834
You're okay, that's all.

01:36:16.251 --> 01:36:18.917
Here. For your mother.

01:36:19.084 --> 01:36:20.917
No. I want you to have it.

01:36:21.084 --> 01:36:23.376
In case the forest
ever stops talking to you.

01:36:26.042 --> 01:36:28.584
These two will hook up some day.
Believe me.

01:36:28.792 --> 01:36:29.792
And you know what?

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:32.667
If she ever gets her feet
on the ground,

01:36:32.834 --> 01:36:34.626
Flecky will be really cool.

01:36:35.459 --> 01:36:37.709
Okay, let's roll.

01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:39.751
Yeah.

01:36:41.917 --> 01:36:44.209
You guys aren't coming?

01:37:15.126 --> 01:37:16.042
Come on, Macky.

01:37:16.209 --> 01:37:17.584
They're coming later.

01:37:20.084 --> 01:37:21.209
Thank you.

01:37:21.834 --> 01:37:23.501
Thank you for taking care of us.

01:37:54.292 --> 01:37:55.417
MY boys!

01:37:56.376 --> 01:37:57.376
- Mom!
- Dad!

01:37:57.542 --> 01:37:58.626
Dad!

01:37:58.792 --> 01:38:00.542
Mom!

01:38:05.292 --> 01:38:07.334
The aquarium!

01:38:07.751 --> 01:38:09.334
I bet you two broke it!

01:38:09.501 --> 01:38:10.709
You're a couple of...!

01:38:11.209 --> 01:38:13.751
We missed you, Mr. Grumpy!

01:38:19.751 --> 01:38:22.501
<i>There you have it.
In the end, after everything,</i>

01:38:22.667 --> 01:38:25.792
<i>we got the best Christmas present
of our lives.</i>

01:38:26.459 --> 01:38:28.584
<i>And what was it, you're wondering?</i>

01:38:29.126 --> 01:38:31.417
<i>- Parents!
- Our pests!</i>

01:38:32.305 --> 01:38:38.636
