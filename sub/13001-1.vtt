03:20.542 --> 03:23.228
Daddy, I want to pick the flowers.

03:23.378 --> 03:25.606
We don't pick 'em, sweetie.
We just look at them.

03:25.756 --> 03:26.607
No, I want to pick them.

03:26.757 --> 03:28.759
She's a little restless.
Honey, I'm gonna take her outside.

03:28.925 --> 03:30.986
- Oh, I'll take her.
- No, no, you finish up.

03:31.136 --> 03:34.891
We'll be fine. We're gonna
go look at the flowers.

03:41.062 --> 03:45.125
- Oh, would you like that gift-wrapped?
- Yes. Thank you.

03:45.275 --> 03:47.869
I'll be right back.

04:03.627 --> 04:07.803
That's what I would buy
for the man in my life.

04:12.093 --> 04:16.223
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

04:25.649 --> 04:27.651
After the funeral...

04:31.029 --> 04:33.202
I was a block of ice. I...

04:33.573 --> 04:38.124
I couldn't bear to feel,
so I felt nothing.

04:39.329 --> 04:42.674
I'm sorry I made such a mess of it.

04:44.501 --> 04:51.134
I'm staying at the Garden Court.
If you wanted to just talk...

04:52.175 --> 04:55.054
I'll be there tonight. We could...

04:56.763 --> 05:03.021
I saw you come in with Carter
and your little girl.

05:04.437 --> 05:08.112
I guess I just didn't thaw out
fast enough.

05:34.718 --> 05:38.488
- Here's a flower for you, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.408
- Are you finished?
- Yeah.

05:41.558 --> 05:42.534
I mean, no.

05:42.684 --> 05:44.244
Honey, are you all right? You look upset.

05:44.394 --> 05:47.898
No, I'm fine. I'm just not finished.

05:48.189 --> 05:50.959
Why don't you take Amy out to the park,
and I catch up with you guys later?

05:51.109 --> 05:53.837
No, I think it's gonna rain.
We're gonna go on home.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.964
But don't be too long.

05:56.114 --> 05:59.176
Amy needs to spend more time
with her mommy.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.095
- More quality time.
- I'll be home soon.

06:02.245 --> 06:04.890
We'll have plenty of time
for quality time.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.759
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Mommy.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.574
- Miss?
- Yes?

06:22.724 --> 06:24.647
I'd like this one also, please.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.685
Mr. Dante's room isn't answering.

06:50.835 --> 06:51.686
Would you like to leave a message?

06:51.836 --> 06:55.273
Yes, can you tell him
that Jenny O'Keefe called

06:55.423 --> 06:56.775
and that I have his keys?

06:56.925 --> 06:57.859
Okay.

06:58.009 --> 07:03.740
And I can meet him at O'Keefe Park...
Camino Park at 1:00.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.439
If he can meet me by the playground,
that would be great.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.922
Hey, Maxine, be careful.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.296
You went too high.

08:58.713 --> 09:01.762
Good. All right. Go ahead.

09:03.134 --> 09:05.236
- Jenny.
- Hi.

09:05.386 --> 09:09.983
- Hi. Where's Amy?
- Home, with Carter.

09:10.141 --> 09:11.368
Oh, I must have missed them today.

09:11.518 --> 09:12.869
You know, what a great guy you've got?

09:13.019 --> 09:15.080
The idea of taking a day off
and spending it with Maxine

09:15.230 --> 09:17.699
hasn't even occurred to my husband.

09:20.151 --> 09:23.246
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

09:26.032 --> 09:29.594
- No.
- What's the matter?

09:29.744 --> 09:33.214
- Sarah, I saw Jack today.
- Jesus.

09:33.748 --> 09:35.750
Uh...

09:36.835 --> 09:39.729
I think he still loves me.

09:39.879 --> 09:43.733
Oh, come on.
Isn't it a little late for that?

09:43.883 --> 09:46.444
He was so flustered, he forgot his keys,

09:46.594 --> 09:49.739
so I'm meeting him here to return 'em.

09:49.889 --> 09:53.939
You know, I hate to bring this up,
but you are married to the perfect man.

09:55.186 --> 09:57.280
The perfect man?

09:58.439 --> 10:02.285
Yesterday, out of the blue,
he started to make love to me

10:02.443 --> 10:05.505
and then stopped when Amy started to cry.

10:05.655 --> 10:07.048
Well, just because
he was worried about Amy...

10:07.198 --> 10:09.426
He wasn't worried about Amy because
he didn't even go to her room.

10:09.576 --> 10:12.455
He went downstairs, got into his car,
and then drove off.

10:17.834 --> 10:22.063
And he's becoming
awfully compulsive with Amy.

10:22.213 --> 10:26.514
He doesn't just take care of her.
He studies her.

10:28.678 --> 10:32.023
I have this horrible feeling it has
something to do with his father.

10:32.724 --> 10:36.479
Jenny, you're not just finding excuses
to start up with Jack again?

10:40.398 --> 10:42.696
I don't know.

10:46.070 --> 10:47.868
Okay, one more time.

10:48.114 --> 10:52.210
- Boy, he looks great.
- Yeah.

10:52.660 --> 10:55.459
Definitely don't do what I wanna do.

10:55.955 --> 10:58.799
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.572
Thank you.

11:12.722 --> 11:15.450
Nothing's quite as stupid
as making a dramatic exit

11:15.600 --> 11:18.286
and having to go back
because you forgot your car keys.

11:18.436 --> 11:21.956
Fortunately, it was a rental.
They sent over another set.

11:22.106 --> 11:25.030
You're very good at dramatic exits.

11:26.319 --> 11:31.299
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
- It's okay. I got over it.

11:31.449 --> 11:34.761
- And I learned something.
- What?

11:34.911 --> 11:37.380
To be the dispassionate doctor.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.800
Let's walk.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.551
Oh...

12:56.701 --> 12:58.920
Three o'clock?

13:12.467 --> 13:16.643
It's okay, sweetie. It's all right, baby.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.101
Why couldn't we just have
an intercom to listen to the baby...

13:21.267 --> 13:23.440
instead of this T.V. thing?

13:29.067 --> 13:31.946
I don't know why I agreed to it.

13:35.073 --> 13:38.873
Taking a couple of years off from
his practice to raise Amy personally.

13:39.535 --> 13:41.846
Testing out a few new approaches
to child raising

13:41.996 --> 13:44.124
right here in his own home.

13:44.374 --> 13:47.423
Maybe even write a book about it.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.728
So I go to work,

13:48.878 --> 13:52.928
and the child psychologist
stays at home, playing house dad.

14:53.901 --> 14:55.699
Oh, no...

15:10.626 --> 15:15.132
Oh, God. I can't let Jack open
Carter's present.

15:30.605 --> 15:34.735
Jack's wife, Emma, was my patient,
dying of lung cancer.

15:35.693 --> 15:39.922
It was agonizing for him, but he came
every night to sit with her.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.342
My heart went out to him.

15:42.492 --> 15:45.712
I wanted so much
to take away some of his pain.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.801
Then I realized it was more than that.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.304
I was falling in love with him.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.745
What?

17:04.031 --> 17:05.282
What's going on?

17:06.242 --> 17:07.593
- Leave the room.
- What?

17:07.742 --> 17:09.512
Leave the room! You must leave the room!

17:09.662 --> 17:10.753
What the hell?

17:13.665 --> 17:14.633
Code blue!

17:17.295 --> 17:20.231
- Get out of the way, sir.
- Coming through.

17:20.381 --> 17:23.276
- What have we got?
- We have cardiac arrest.

17:23.425 --> 17:26.349
- Here's a bag.
- One milligram epinephrine.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.149
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

19:01.732 --> 19:04.627
Happy Valentine's Day.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.154
This for me?

19:06.320 --> 19:07.713
You came back.

19:07.863 --> 19:09.632
Well, I just came here because I was...

19:09.782 --> 19:10.883
Why did you run away?

19:11.033 --> 19:13.052
I don't know. I thought I saw someone.

19:13.202 --> 19:15.330
- Where?
- In the woods.

19:16.330 --> 19:18.766
Well, he's not here now, is he?

19:18.916 --> 19:20.768
Huh?

19:20.918 --> 19:22.920
Is he?

19:33.973 --> 19:36.317
But there was someone.

20:06.130 --> 20:08.007
Oh...

20:10.968 --> 20:13.437
Oh, my God.

20:16.098 --> 20:17.408
Sarah, it's Jenny.

20:17.558 --> 20:19.535
Jenny, my God, are you all right?

20:19.685 --> 20:20.494
Yes, I'm fine.

20:20.644 --> 20:24.457
I've been worried to death.
Carter's been calling all night.

20:24.607 --> 20:28.294
- Oh, no.
- What happened to you?

20:28.444 --> 20:31.964
- I was with Jack.
- At his hotel? All night?

20:32.114 --> 20:34.800
Look, I can't explain right now.
What did Carter say?

20:34.950 --> 20:37.303
Since you didn't come home,
and no one knew where you were,

20:37.453 --> 20:38.846
he figured you had an accident.

20:38.996 --> 20:40.556
He called all the hospitals and the police.

20:40.706 --> 20:42.224
He's got the whole world looking for you.

20:42.374 --> 20:43.967
What are you going to tell him?

20:55.596 --> 20:59.442
Honey. Honey, it's okay. I'm right here.

21:01.268 --> 21:04.112
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.332
I had the worst dream.

21:06.482 --> 21:10.828
I'll say. You were moaning
and waving your hands around.

21:12.488 --> 21:15.708
I dreamt I was in the weirdest car accident.

21:15.866 --> 21:17.868
Well, you're okay now.

21:19.036 --> 21:21.555
Why don't I get you a glass of water? Hmm?

21:21.705 --> 21:24.504
Okay. Thanks, sweetie.

21:29.004 --> 21:31.883
I've been so worried about you, honey.

21:33.008 --> 21:35.727
I think you've been working too hard.

21:36.887 --> 21:39.982
You shouldn't have to carry the whole load.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.853
It's beginning to take a toll on you.

21:45.396 --> 21:47.415
I don't know.

21:47.565 --> 21:51.320
Maybe we should be rethinking
this whole parenting arrangement.

21:51.485 --> 21:53.738
I just don't think it's been fair to you.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.923
And, anyway, one of these days

21:56.073 --> 21:58.843
I'm gonna have to get back
to my own practice.

21:58.993 --> 22:00.040
You know?

22:04.498 --> 22:09.299
Maybe we could get a sitter in,
during the day.

22:16.719 --> 22:19.689
I should go back to work.
What do you think?

22:21.765 --> 22:23.767
I think...

22:56.508 --> 22:59.195
- You taking off, Karen?
- Trying to.

22:59.345 --> 23:01.530
- Need a hand?
- Would you mind?

23:01.680 --> 23:04.241
Are you giving your mommy
a hard time? Huh?

23:04.391 --> 23:06.494
- No.
- You let Carter do it?

23:06.644 --> 23:10.289
There you go. Amy, did you say hi to Sam?

23:10.439 --> 23:12.208
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Amy.

23:12.358 --> 23:15.002
- Darn.
- Something wrong?

23:15.152 --> 23:19.965
No, no. Jenny was supposed
to pick us up half an hour ago.

23:20.115 --> 23:22.927
She probably got delayed
at the hospital again.

23:23.077 --> 23:25.045
Can I drop you somewhere?
I've got an extra seat in the back.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.421
Oh, that'd be great!

23:27.748 --> 23:29.433
He is such an amazing kid.

23:29.583 --> 23:31.836
You've done a great job with him, Karen.

23:32.002 --> 23:33.521
- Oh, please.
- No, no. I mean it.

23:33.671 --> 23:36.774
Do you realize how important these
early years are in Sam's development?

23:36.924 --> 23:38.776
Are you kidding? I've read all the books,

23:38.926 --> 23:43.496
and, of course, I get all the expert advice
I can handle from my mother-in-law.

23:44.139 --> 23:47.535
I know what you mean.
I've seen her in action. Oh, boy.

23:47.685 --> 23:49.662
What, don't you have
any know-it-all relatives?

23:49.812 --> 23:53.207
Oh, listen, my father wrote the book
on child development.

23:53.357 --> 23:55.626
Fortunately, it's in Norwegian.

23:55.776 --> 23:58.170
What does he have to say
on the subject? In English, please.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.923
- What does he not have to say?
- That bad?

24:01.073 --> 24:04.260
No. Actually, he's one of the most
visionary men in his field.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.879
He heads a child-development clinic
outside of Oslo.

24:07.037 --> 24:09.665
In fact, we're taking Amy
over there next week.

24:10.249 --> 24:13.719
Jenny never said anything to me
about Amy going to a clinic in Norway.

24:14.461 --> 24:17.010
You know, it would be a great
opportunity for you and Sam.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.651
Oh, I think Sam's a little young
for a trip to Norway.

24:20.801 --> 24:23.779
Oh, I don't know about that.
A big boy like Sam?

24:23.929 --> 24:26.478
But what's so visionary
about your dad's clinic, anyway?

24:26.640 --> 24:32.037
Well, first of all, it's in a beautiful,
natural country setting.

24:32.187 --> 24:35.499
Amy will be supervised
by a team of child psychologists

24:35.649 --> 24:37.902
who record her progress hourly.

24:38.277 --> 24:41.702
But the thing is,
you can't study child development

24:41.864 --> 24:43.841
and think anyone is gonna
take it seriously

24:43.991 --> 24:46.427
if you only have one subject.

24:46.577 --> 24:48.921
It's just another case history.

24:49.079 --> 24:53.183
So, what we're setting up is
a control group of gifted children.

24:53.333 --> 24:57.396
We'll need at least five, none of them
older than three years old.

24:57.546 --> 24:58.981
That's why I wanted to talk to you
about Sam...

24:59.131 --> 25:00.858
Being one of your guinea pigs?

25:01.008 --> 25:04.308
- Oh, Carter, you've got to be kidding.
- No.

25:04.678 --> 25:08.073
Nobody's gonna let their kid
go to some snake pit in Norway

25:08.223 --> 25:10.451
to be part of some developmental study.

25:10.601 --> 25:12.069
It's not a snake pit.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.456
Do you think I'd let Amy
have anything to do with this

25:15.606 --> 25:16.749
unless it was completely safe?

25:16.899 --> 25:20.169
No! But I can't believe
that Jenny's going along with this.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.589
- Let's just forget the whole subject.
- Well, don't get mad, Carter.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.224
- Bless you.
- I'm not mad.

25:28.911 --> 25:31.096
We're friends, remember?

25:31.246 --> 25:35.559
And, as a friend, I'm telling you...
the whole idea is crazy.

25:35.709 --> 25:38.062
I mean, how did you think
that any sane parent

25:38.212 --> 25:40.105
would allow their kid to be
part of something like that?

25:40.255 --> 25:42.608
Karen, do you realize
that no one really knows anything

25:42.758 --> 25:44.902
about personality development?

25:45.052 --> 25:48.447
Everything up to now
has been pure conjecture.

25:48.597 --> 25:53.743
All we psychiatrists do is chase cows
after the barn door has been opened.

25:55.229 --> 25:58.791
Here, for the first time, we'll have
an opportunity to observe what happens,

25:58.941 --> 26:02.920
when it happens, and precisely monitor
the psychological consequences.

26:03.070 --> 26:05.580
Well, not with my kid, you don't.

26:06.740 --> 26:08.467
- Sorry. You all right? Hang on.
- Oh, God! It's in my eyes!

26:08.617 --> 26:10.915
I've got the wheel.

26:14.957 --> 26:16.934
I'm so sorry.

26:17.084 --> 26:20.896
- Karen... Are you all right?
- I've got something in my eye.

26:21.046 --> 26:24.016
- Oh, it hurts.
- Oh, here. Let me have a look.

26:24.174 --> 26:28.850
Look up. Now, look down.
It's just the tiniest bit of dirt.

26:29.012 --> 26:31.198
- Oh, it hurts!
- Here, just keep your eyes closed.

26:31.348 --> 26:32.850
I'll... I'll get you a...

26:33.058 --> 26:36.062
I'll get a... a tissue.

26:36.937 --> 26:37.871
Are the kids okay?

26:38.021 --> 26:41.166
Don't move! They're fine. They're fine.

26:41.316 --> 26:44.786
They're fine. So sorry. I'm so sorry.

26:45.654 --> 26:47.231
What's that smell?

26:49.408 --> 26:52.958
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:49.051 --> 27:50.736
- Kiss her.
- What?

27:50.886 --> 27:53.280
You've got about five seconds
before those guys are in your face

27:53.430 --> 27:57.230
and what do you think you look like,
killer? Go on, kiss her!

28:03.273 --> 28:05.947
Ooh! Well done.

28:14.785 --> 28:17.709
- When did you get out?
- Move over.

28:23.627 --> 28:28.065
Isn't this pleasant?
We just gonna sit here all day?

28:28.215 --> 28:32.140
- What are you doing here?
- I'm saving your ass, that's what.

28:32.302 --> 28:34.446
I was just supposed to come along
as an observer.

28:34.596 --> 28:37.741
Right now, what I'm observing is very odd.

28:37.891 --> 28:39.952
Twins brothers chatting
in the front seat of a car,

28:40.102 --> 28:42.162
while the driver
is slumped over the wheel.

28:42.312 --> 28:44.986
- What is wrong with this picture?
- I don't need you!

28:45.148 --> 28:46.400
"I don't need you!"

28:50.195 --> 28:53.090
Let's get out of here, Carter,
before we're seen...

28:53.240 --> 28:57.040
because, believe me, we'll be remembered.

28:59.204 --> 29:02.015
You can drop me off at the next corner.
I could use a drink.

29:02.165 --> 29:04.935
- Don't follow me anymore.
- "Don't follow me anymore."

29:05.085 --> 29:05.936
- Stop that!
- "Stop that!"

29:06.086 --> 29:07.020
Stop it!

29:07.170 --> 29:09.468
All right, all right.

29:10.424 --> 29:14.069
- Jesus.
- Oh, Carter...

29:14.219 --> 29:16.221
You're a thankless dope.

29:17.681 --> 29:21.356
I was only trying to help,
which, of course, I did.

29:21.852 --> 29:24.037
This thing you're doing
means everything to the old man,

29:24.187 --> 29:26.248
and you can't fuck it up.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.084
- I'm not fucking anything up.
- Oh, really? By the way,

29:29.234 --> 29:31.703
what were you planning on doing
with the little missus here?

29:32.404 --> 29:34.840
I'm gonna...

29:34.990 --> 29:37.118
take her back to the park
and leave her there.

29:37.951 --> 29:41.138
Very good. I see you've got this
all thought out.

29:41.288 --> 29:44.892
"Take her back to the park
and leave her there." And then what?

29:45.042 --> 29:47.519
And when the chloroform wears off,
she'll be fine.

29:47.669 --> 29:49.637
And when you get home, the cops
will be sitting on your doorstep.

29:50.464 --> 29:51.716
I won't hurt her!

29:51.882 --> 29:54.726
You won't hurt her! She'll hurt you!

29:57.179 --> 30:01.658
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

30:01.808 --> 30:05.358
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
- What?

30:06.271 --> 30:09.741
First, stop off at your place.
I need to get out of these clothes.

30:10.317 --> 30:14.788
- And then you... need to get lost.
- And then what?

30:17.657 --> 30:20.010
The cat's in the bag...

30:20.160 --> 30:22.629
and the bag is in the river.

31:32.524 --> 31:37.037
I've been up all night with Mrs. Bellor.
The radiation seems to be working.

31:39.197 --> 31:43.760
Honey, I'm gonna lie down for a bit
before I take her for her checkup.

31:43.910 --> 31:46.163
Isn't she beautiful?

32:53.855 --> 32:57.826
Oh, Dr. Nix. Oh, how horny we are.

33:01.196 --> 33:04.075
Ow! You're hurting me.

33:18.713 --> 33:21.592
That's all right. I'll get her.

33:23.218 --> 33:25.779
You just wait here.

33:25.929 --> 33:27.772
Okay.

33:37.274 --> 33:38.867
Mommy! Mommy!

33:53.164 --> 33:54.516
Mommy!

33:54.666 --> 34:00.088
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

34:22.944 --> 34:24.992
Shut up!

34:27.072 --> 34:29.121
Stop that.

34:46.509 --> 34:49.029
I was afraid of this.

34:49.179 --> 34:53.730
I wanted him to do this himself.
I didn't want you to help him.

34:54.225 --> 34:57.650
Gee, Daddy, I was only trying to help out.

34:57.812 --> 35:00.582
If I hadn't been there,
we'd all be fucked.

35:01.691 --> 35:04.002
Carter's an amateur. He panicked.

35:04.152 --> 35:06.379
Oh, stop it!

35:06.529 --> 35:08.577
I know you, Cain.

35:09.866 --> 35:12.540
Carter weakened, and you stepped in.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.924
We all know your tough-guy act.

35:21.002 --> 35:23.801
But we don't need a loose cannon here.

35:25.465 --> 35:28.264
Carter can finish this himself.

35:28.968 --> 35:32.739
Let me tell you something, Doctor.
I know Carter wants to help,

35:32.889 --> 35:36.519
but we're talking about stealing kids
here and experimenting on 'em.

35:36.810 --> 35:39.563
You may need this "loose cannon".

35:39.729 --> 35:44.986
You should never have gotten out.
You're nothing but a cheap hoodlum.

35:46.027 --> 35:48.004
I am what you made me, Dad.

35:48.154 --> 35:49.923
Oh, shut up and finish your drink.

35:50.073 --> 35:51.245
I already have.

35:54.494 --> 35:57.168
Then, let me get you another.

36:01.334 --> 36:03.728
You know...

36:03.878 --> 36:06.973
you could get us all put away for good.

36:09.342 --> 36:11.945
There's no jail that can hold me.

36:12.095 --> 36:14.739
I'm the escape artist, remember?

36:14.889 --> 36:18.451
I learned it breaking out
of all those cages you locked me in.

36:18.601 --> 36:20.820
They were not cages!

36:21.104 --> 36:24.124
They were a specially designed
infant environment.

36:24.274 --> 36:25.617
They were cages!

36:25.775 --> 36:28.403
Hush, hush now. You'll wake the child.

36:29.404 --> 36:32.799
But, hey, I'm not one to hold a grudge.

36:32.949 --> 36:37.125
After all, where would I be
without you, Bamse?

36:39.414 --> 36:41.667
You wouldn't exist.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.853
That's right, but I do exist, don't I?

36:45.003 --> 36:48.803
I'm that fucked-up experiment of yours
that just won't go away.

36:48.965 --> 36:52.485
Hickory dickory dock.
Cain has picked his lock.

36:52.635 --> 36:54.637
I'm out of here.

36:54.804 --> 36:57.907
The cat's in the bag,
and the bag is going in the river.

36:58.057 --> 37:00.035
So don't fuck with me, Dad!

37:00.185 --> 37:04.190
You may lose more
than your license this time.

37:14.991 --> 37:16.959
Have you talked to the others?

37:18.578 --> 37:22.458
- About what?
- About what we are doing.

37:23.124 --> 37:27.925
Are you kidding? If Margo finds out...

37:32.717 --> 37:36.893
- Hey, what did you put in this?
- Just something to relax you.

37:38.097 --> 37:40.441
You fucking...!

37:54.989 --> 37:57.458
I want you to sleep now, Cain.

38:01.287 --> 38:06.839
You've done a good job,
but we don't need you anymore.

38:07.544 --> 38:10.388
I want you to relax and sleep.

38:12.423 --> 38:15.097
Carter can handle everything now.

38:17.011 --> 38:19.656
That doesn't make any sense.

38:19.806 --> 38:22.104
Carter isn't making any sense.

38:22.308 --> 38:25.152
I have this horrible feeling it has
something to do with his father.

38:26.229 --> 38:29.529
Jenny, you're not just finding excuses
to start up with Jack again?

38:31.943 --> 38:35.664
- Boy, he looks great.
- Yeah.

38:36.489 --> 38:38.708
Definitely don't do what I wanna do.

38:39.784 --> 38:40.910
Good luck.

38:41.119 --> 38:42.871
Thanks.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.198
- Dr. Nix.
- Oh, hi, Nan.

39:02.348 --> 39:05.034
- Can you do me a big favor?
- Yeah, of course.

39:05.184 --> 39:06.995
My dipshit boyfriend forgot to pick me up.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.955
Can you drop me off at Mrs. Roberts'?

39:09.105 --> 39:11.207
Sure, I...

39:11.357 --> 39:15.670
I just have to pick something up first.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.089
Can you keep an eye on Amy for me?

39:18.239 --> 39:22.426
- Yeah. Yeah, no problem.
- I'll be right back.

39:43.598 --> 39:44.975
Jesus!

39:48.353 --> 39:51.232
Come on! Be a Peeping Tom
on your own time.

39:51.397 --> 39:53.249
We're gonna lose that kid.

39:53.399 --> 39:57.045
- That's my wife.
- No shit?

39:58.655 --> 40:03.635
I married her too soon.
She never got over him.

40:03.785 --> 40:05.969
No question of that.

40:10.375 --> 40:13.386
Look, Carter, why don't you just go home?

40:14.086 --> 40:16.663
I'll handle the baby-sitter.

40:17.465 --> 40:19.559
I guess you're right.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.679
I don't feel very well.

40:23.846 --> 40:27.441
I'd better just go home and sleep.

40:28.643 --> 40:33.069
That's right. You go sleep.
I'll take care of everything.

40:34.148 --> 40:37.126
I'll just be you for a while, huh?

40:37.276 --> 40:39.950
Until this whole mess is cleaned up.

41:02.885 --> 41:04.979
Poor schmuck.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.307
Ooh...

41:42.508 --> 41:45.011
Oooh... yes!

41:54.437 --> 41:57.532
Where'd you get that neat trench coat?

41:59.942 --> 42:01.535
I copped it.

42:05.114 --> 42:09.093
You know, Dr. Nix, I should be
going out with older guys.

42:09.243 --> 42:11.012
I'll tell you something.

42:11.162 --> 42:15.258
For a man your age, you're uh...
you're still pretty cute.

42:17.835 --> 42:21.965
It's not the mileage, honey.
It's the make.

42:26.052 --> 42:29.431
Keep an eye on the monster.
I gotta go pee.

42:29.722 --> 42:31.724
I'll be right back.

43:17.645 --> 43:20.331
I know what you're going to do.

43:20.481 --> 43:24.281
It's a bad thing, and I'm gonna tell.

43:26.946 --> 43:29.199
Get out of here!

43:35.538 --> 43:37.381
Shit.

44:31.677 --> 44:34.521
What's the matter? Jenny?

46:00.474 --> 46:02.897
Help! Somebody help!

46:06.188 --> 46:09.613
Help! Carter!

46:09.984 --> 46:11.577
Carter!

46:12.820 --> 46:15.699
Carter! Carter!

47:42.827 --> 47:44.044
Jenny.

47:49.792 --> 47:52.311
Oh, Jenny.

48:16.944 --> 48:19.914
We were all going
to the beach today to have a...

48:21.198 --> 48:23.759
a Valentine's Day picnic.

48:23.909 --> 48:27.388
Jenny took Amy to the park
while I packed up the Jeep.

48:27.538 --> 48:30.391
I guess that was at about 8:00.

48:30.541 --> 48:33.144
They were supposed to be back at 10:00.

48:33.294 --> 48:37.982
My wife is never late.
I was immediately concerned.

48:38.132 --> 48:43.821
So I... I went to the park to search
for them at about 10:30,

48:43.971 --> 48:46.157
but they weren't there.

48:46.307 --> 48:50.278
So I called up you fellas
and came right over here.

48:51.270 --> 48:53.080
Dr. Nix, I'm sorry to say,

48:53.230 --> 48:56.500
we've had a few other disappearances
from this park.

48:56.650 --> 48:58.252
And judging from your description,

48:58.402 --> 49:00.755
your wife and daughter
were likely candidates.

49:00.905 --> 49:04.216
You mean... they might
have been kidnapped?

49:04.366 --> 49:05.760
We don't know.

49:05.910 --> 49:08.095
All we know now
is that they've disappeared.

49:08.245 --> 49:12.516
You told us you went there
fairly regularly with your little girl.

49:12.666 --> 49:13.601
That's right.

49:13.751 --> 49:15.811
Did you ever notice anybody
that didn't look right,

49:15.961 --> 49:19.273
another man or a woman
that seemed to be hanging around?

49:19.423 --> 49:21.551
No.

49:21.884 --> 49:27.186
Wait a minute. There was somebody, a man.

49:28.265 --> 49:33.204
I remember because... I noticed he
didn't seem to have a child with him.

49:33.354 --> 49:36.528
Why would you come to a playground
without a child?

49:37.024 --> 49:39.986
Before you run through the mugshots, why
don't you sit down with our sketch artist?

49:40.152 --> 49:42.588
It should be helpful to get a picture
of this guy out on the wire.

49:42.738 --> 49:44.799
Of course.

49:44.949 --> 49:47.760
Peters, it's Cally.
I want you to do a sketch for me.

49:47.910 --> 49:51.084
Yeah, right away. I'll send him over?

49:52.623 --> 49:53.641
See that guy over there?

49:53.791 --> 49:55.559
That's Jay Peters. He's our sketch man.

49:55.709 --> 49:58.007
Why don't you go over there and see
what you guys can come up with?

49:59.129 --> 50:01.803
- All right.
- Come on.

50:02.925 --> 50:06.680
And, uh... thanks for all your help.

50:12.935 --> 50:14.937
Dr. Nix, Jay Peters.

50:15.104 --> 50:17.498
How you doing? Why don't you have a seat.

50:17.648 --> 50:20.292
- Just do the best you can.
- You got it.

50:26.073 --> 50:28.201
Poor guy.

50:29.743 --> 50:32.346
- This is getting out of hand, Sean.
- Yup.

50:32.496 --> 50:34.682
It seems like a serial to me.

50:34.832 --> 50:37.435
A detective's dream...
the motiveless murder.

50:37.585 --> 50:39.087
What do we got now?

50:39.253 --> 50:42.565
Two moms, a baby-sitter,
and all their kids are gone.

50:42.715 --> 50:44.859
- From the same playground.
- Right.

50:45.009 --> 50:47.307
And there's Dr. Nix.

50:49.388 --> 50:51.323
- What do you mean?
- Nix...

50:51.473 --> 50:54.101
It's the kind of name
that sticks in your head.

50:54.268 --> 50:57.371
- From where?
- From ancient history.

50:57.521 --> 50:59.615
Oh, your specialty.

51:00.733 --> 51:02.710
Let's go home, Mack. It's time to go home.

51:02.860 --> 51:04.128
Sean, come on.

51:04.278 --> 51:06.714
- Go home.
- You know, I wouldn't waste your time.

51:06.864 --> 51:09.993
When you retire, you go home.
You don't come to the office anymore.

51:10.159 --> 51:13.333
Just go home, sit in your favorite chair,
watch the shopping channel,

51:13.495 --> 51:14.722
go wash your car.

51:14.872 --> 51:18.593
Take your grandkids to the zoo.
Maybe even go see a ball game.

51:18.751 --> 51:21.562
What you don't do is hang around here
looking over our shoulders,

51:21.712 --> 51:23.939
like some goddamn
Monday morning quarterback.

51:24.089 --> 51:25.261
I'm just trying to help you out.

51:25.424 --> 51:27.276
You're not helping out, you're in the way.

51:27.426 --> 51:32.273
Yeah? Well, maybe you can tell me
who this Dr. Nix is.

51:32.473 --> 51:34.742
It's that guy over there
working with Peters.

51:34.892 --> 51:37.286
Yeah. Any dope can see that.

51:37.436 --> 51:40.623
But I worked another Nix case
20 years ago.

51:40.773 --> 51:44.251
20 years ago. What are you talking about?

51:44.401 --> 51:47.496
I'm talking about that guy's old man.

51:48.614 --> 51:51.592
- Are you sure?
- Same name, same face.

51:51.742 --> 51:54.303
So, what did your Dr. Nix do?

51:54.453 --> 51:57.806
We got an anonymous tip
he was buying babies.

51:57.956 --> 52:00.050
I remember we caught him with five.

52:00.209 --> 52:03.383
Five? Was he starting a basketball team?

52:03.545 --> 52:06.357
- Who knows?
- So what happened to him?

52:06.507 --> 52:09.652
After he got convicted, he jumped bail
and left the country.

52:09.802 --> 52:11.695
He was Swedish or something.
We couldn't extradite him.

52:11.845 --> 52:14.073
- Great. Thanks for sharing, Mack.
- Wait a minute here.

52:14.223 --> 52:18.744
At his trial, an associate testified
against him, a Dr. Lynn Waldheim.

52:18.894 --> 52:21.989
Still works around here.
I just called Waldheim's office.

52:22.147 --> 52:25.251
They tell me the doctor
checked into the hospital.

52:25.401 --> 52:28.379
- What's the matter with him?
- It's a her. Cancer.

52:28.529 --> 52:32.132
I told her about the kids disappearing
and one of their father's was a Dr. Nix.

52:32.282 --> 52:34.330
She says she'll be right over.

52:36.912 --> 52:38.931
So this is retirement?

52:39.081 --> 52:43.151
I think I'll just have
a heart attack right here.

52:44.044 --> 52:46.397
I could never retire, so I don't.

52:46.547 --> 52:49.066
- You don't mind, do you, guys?
- Mack...

52:49.216 --> 52:51.569
Consider yourself back on my task force.

52:51.719 --> 52:53.596
Thanks, Terri.

52:54.388 --> 52:55.239
Hey...

52:55.389 --> 52:58.142
Hey, Sean. Thanks.

53:00.769 --> 53:02.371
I know what you guys are thinking.

53:02.521 --> 53:04.690
- Like father, like son.
- Slam dunk, right?

53:05.023 --> 53:06.375
It's too easy.

53:06.525 --> 53:09.628
Just because his father's a nut
doesn't mean Carter has to be.

53:09.778 --> 53:11.672
I'm going with what we got.

53:11.822 --> 53:13.632
Two mothers, a baby-sitter, and their kids

53:13.782 --> 53:15.551
disappear from the same playground.

53:15.701 --> 53:18.053
As soon as Peters has finished
with that sketch, I want it over there...

53:18.203 --> 53:20.964
shown to everybody that's been there
in the last month.

53:21.123 --> 53:22.625
Yeah?

53:24.293 --> 53:26.261
When?

53:26.420 --> 53:28.856
We'll be right down.

53:29.006 --> 53:31.259
Car popped up out of Half Moon Marsh.

53:31.425 --> 53:35.487
Had a woman's body in it.
They just brought it in downstairs.

53:35.637 --> 53:38.574
- Oh, God.
- Do we bring him?

53:38.724 --> 53:41.022
Let's see how bad she is.

53:44.646 --> 53:46.790
- How's it going?
- He's doing very well.

53:46.940 --> 53:49.543
It's amazing. It looks just like him.

53:49.693 --> 53:52.412
I think he was wearing a trench coat.

53:53.238 --> 53:55.132
- My God.
- Ma'am?

53:55.282 --> 53:58.252
Let me know as soon
as you're finished. Let's go.

53:58.410 --> 54:03.390
- Detective Terri, this is Dr. Waldheim.
- Oh, thanks for coming over.

54:03.540 --> 54:06.894
It's uncanny.
He looks exactly like his father.

54:07.044 --> 54:08.187
That's Carter Nix.

54:08.337 --> 54:10.055
It couldn't be anyone else.

54:10.214 --> 54:13.025
And his wife and child have disappeared?

54:13.175 --> 54:14.485
It gets worse.

54:14.635 --> 54:18.515
We got a dead woman downstairs
that could be his wife.

54:19.473 --> 54:22.576
So much tragedy in one family.

54:22.726 --> 54:25.621
- Could you walk with us?
- Certainly.

54:25.771 --> 54:27.819
This way.

54:29.733 --> 54:33.128
- Are you feeling up to this?
- I hate this wig.

54:33.278 --> 54:36.131
I told them to get me a Grey one.
My hair is Grey.

54:36.281 --> 54:37.591
They couldn't find one.

54:37.741 --> 54:40.719
- I look like a transvestite.
- It looks fine.

54:40.869 --> 54:43.668
You're very kind,
but you don't lie very well.

54:44.665 --> 54:48.602
- So, you were trained by Dr. Nix?
- I took my residency with him.

54:48.752 --> 54:51.146
- Why him?
- Because he was the best.

54:51.296 --> 54:54.608
I was especially interested in his work
on multiple personalities.

54:54.758 --> 54:57.728
We'd wrote a book together
based on one of his patients.

54:58.011 --> 55:00.823
In the book, we called him Cain.

55:00.973 --> 55:02.741
"Three Faces Of Cain" or something?

55:02.891 --> 55:05.202
He had many more faces
than that, detective.

55:05.352 --> 55:08.122
Down here. So, what was the book called?

55:08.272 --> 55:13.377
"Raising Cain: The Creation
and Evolution of the Multiple Personality."

55:13.527 --> 55:18.090
It was a bestseller.
They even made a TV movie out of it.

55:18.240 --> 55:21.051
I heard he made quite a lot of money.

55:21.201 --> 55:24.471
I wouldn't have any of it. I had
my name removed from the book.

55:24.621 --> 55:25.931
Why?

55:26.081 --> 55:28.225
I didn't want any part
of that kind of money.

55:28.375 --> 55:30.144
What kind of money was that?

55:30.294 --> 55:33.480
Money profited off
the misfortune of another.

55:33.630 --> 55:35.357
But you still wrote the book.

55:35.507 --> 55:36.400
That's right.

55:36.550 --> 55:39.653
I didn't know all the circumstances
surrounding the case when I started.

55:39.803 --> 55:43.073
- And what were they? This way.
- Yes. Let me explain.

55:43.223 --> 55:44.992
All multiple personality patients,

55:45.142 --> 55:47.828
regardless of the differences
in their background,

55:47.978 --> 55:50.706
seem to share certain childhood traumas.

55:50.856 --> 55:54.793
When these occur, the original
personality splinters into others.

55:54.943 --> 55:57.963
For instance, if a boy
is molested by his mother

55:58.113 --> 56:01.538
or abused by his father, the original...

56:02.618 --> 56:04.291
Ah.

56:05.329 --> 56:08.629
...the original personality
forgets it ever happened.

56:08.790 --> 56:12.260
How could his loving parent
do such a terrible thing?

56:12.419 --> 56:15.397
And he creates an alternate personality.

56:15.547 --> 56:18.233
This becomes the person it happened to.

56:18.383 --> 56:22.154
He is the one who suffers the pain
for all the rest.

56:22.304 --> 56:24.698
Hmm, built-in fall guy,
you do something bad,

56:24.848 --> 56:26.658
the other personality takes the rap.

56:26.808 --> 56:28.535
Sounds very convenient. Straight ahead.

56:28.685 --> 56:32.331
It is not a psychological state
one wishes to acquire.

56:32.481 --> 56:35.667
Every time there is another trauma,
there may be another personality.

56:35.817 --> 56:39.213
Pretty soon there are scores of them
running around inside your head,

56:39.363 --> 56:41.131
squabbling amongst themselves

56:41.281 --> 56:44.218
as to which one gets to control
the consciousness.

56:44.368 --> 56:48.764
Only one personality can control
the consciousness at one time.

56:48.914 --> 56:53.420
- So, now they're talking to each other.
- Sounds like one messed-up guy.

56:53.585 --> 56:57.981
Yes, but by carefully
observing and documenting

56:58.131 --> 57:01.568
the formation and development
of Cain's multiples,

57:01.718 --> 57:05.598
Dr. Nix was creating a whole new
theory of personality evolvement.

57:05.764 --> 57:07.266
Hmm.

57:07.432 --> 57:10.427
Yeah. There was only one problem.

57:10.577 --> 57:12.788
Only one? What was that?

57:12.938 --> 57:16.238
- The raw data.
- Raw data.

57:17.192 --> 57:20.254
The raw data was extraordinarily detailed.

57:20.404 --> 57:23.090
It was as if he'd gotten
into a time machine

57:23.240 --> 57:26.051
and gone back to witness
each one of Cain's personalities

57:26.201 --> 57:28.303
splitting traumas as it occurred.

57:28.453 --> 57:31.139
I was never allowed to meet Cain.

57:31.289 --> 57:35.185
His true identity was known
only to Dr. Nix.

57:35.335 --> 57:37.396
All the information I had

57:37.546 --> 57:40.983
I transcribed from tapes recorded
during their sessions.

57:41.133 --> 57:44.778
So, how do you think
he got the information?

57:44.928 --> 57:46.780
I never knew for sure,

57:46.930 --> 57:51.451
but years later, when he got arrested
for trying to buy babies,

57:51.601 --> 57:54.730
I suspected there could only
be one answer.

57:55.897 --> 57:57.833
Yeah?

57:57.983 --> 58:03.338
He had created Cain's multiple
personalities in order to study them.

58:03.488 --> 58:07.885
He had taken some innocent child
and split its personality.

58:08.035 --> 58:11.013
Now, he needed a control group
to test his theories,

58:11.163 --> 58:13.932
that's what he was buying the babies for.

58:17.586 --> 58:18.896
Uh-huh.

58:19.046 --> 58:21.064
To the right.

58:21.214 --> 58:23.650
And you testified
against him at his trial?

58:23.800 --> 58:26.904
Oh, a man like that should be in jail!

58:27.054 --> 58:31.033
- What happened to Cain?
- Only Dr. Nix knew that.

58:31.183 --> 58:32.784
What's the story, Al?

58:32.934 --> 58:35.437
Ah, it looks like she was put in the car
when she was still alive

58:35.604 --> 58:36.496
and then drowned.

58:36.646 --> 58:39.499
Look at her nails.
See how they're cut and torn?

58:39.649 --> 58:42.669
Looks like she was trying
to claw her way out.

58:42.819 --> 58:45.914
You should see the expression on her face.

58:53.914 --> 58:56.266
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
I think we got lucky.

58:56.416 --> 58:58.477
Ladies picked out the guy
on the bench over there.

58:58.627 --> 59:00.550
He's real close.

59:02.964 --> 59:05.058
All right.

59:14.768 --> 59:17.567
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me?

59:18.188 --> 59:23.069
I'm Lieutenant Terri, Bay View Police.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

59:25.028 --> 59:26.964
It's just a short ride
and a couple of questions, okay?

59:27.114 --> 59:28.090
You'll help us out a lot.

59:28.240 --> 59:30.384
Short ride? I could help you out here.

59:30.534 --> 59:32.161
Do you have a car here in the lot?

59:32.327 --> 59:34.429
Yes, I have... This is my car right here.

59:34.579 --> 59:36.390
- This is your car?
- I mean, it's a rental car.

59:36.540 --> 59:38.475
Could you give the keys
to Detective Carleton, please?

59:38.625 --> 59:39.977
You ride with us.

59:40.127 --> 59:41.311
I don't understand what...

59:41.461 --> 59:42.771
Sure, the keys...

59:42.921 --> 59:46.817
You can have the keys.
I just rented it yesterday.

59:46.967 --> 59:48.902
I'm visiting.

59:49.052 --> 59:50.770
Here. These are...

59:50.929 --> 59:53.991
- What is this? What is this?
- I must have rubbed...

59:54.141 --> 59:56.952
- Huh? This looks like blood.
- I've never seen that.

59:57.102 --> 59:58.954
Would you open this?

59:59.104 --> 01:00:02.074
Yeah, sure. It's probably the round key.

01:00:02.941 --> 01:00:06.662
I don't know what you expect to find.
I'm not hiding anything.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.297
Weapons or something.

01:00:09.447 --> 01:00:11.700
Oh, my God.

01:00:24.838 --> 01:00:26.982
- Hello?
- Carter?

01:00:27.132 --> 01:00:30.068
- Yes, sir?
- Turn on channel six.

01:00:30.218 --> 01:00:32.687
There's gonna mean light rain and then...

01:00:33.805 --> 01:00:35.741
A Bayland Park man
was indicted this afternoon

01:00:35.891 --> 01:00:39.191
on charges he killed
an 18-year-old baby-sitter.

01:00:39.352 --> 01:00:42.122
- You're a good boy, Carter.
- Thank you, sir.

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:46.626
Now, meet me at the hotel
at 4:00 a.m. downstairs.

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:47.919
Yes, sir, I'll be there.

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:50.422
The children must be moved tonight.
Good-bye now.

01:00:50.572 --> 01:00:53.300
Bye-bye, Bamse.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:56.344
The charges against Jack Dante, 35,

01:00:56.494 --> 01:00:58.889
include first-degree murder
and kidnapping.

01:00:59.039 --> 01:01:03.060
He is also being questioned about
the disappearance of Sam Bowman,

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:04.770
age four, of Bayview.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.843
The body of his mother Karen Bowman

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.900
was recovered early this morning by police

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:12.098
from the trunk of her car
in Half Moon Marsh.

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:36.862
Wake up!

01:02:37.012 --> 01:02:40.323
- Don't move or I'll cut it.
- Jenny, what are you doing?

01:02:40.473 --> 01:02:42.492
I'm bleeding. Oh, my God, I'm bleeding!

01:02:42.642 --> 01:02:43.910
And I can help you.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.287
Don't let me die, Jenny!

01:02:45.437 --> 01:02:47.164
I wanna know what you've done with Amy!

01:02:47.314 --> 01:02:50.292
- Amy? What are you saying?
- I want answers, Carter!

01:02:50.442 --> 01:02:53.712
- How could you let me drown like that?
- What's happened?

01:02:53.862 --> 01:02:57.549
Was it because of Jack? You saw us
in the park together, didn't you?

01:02:57.699 --> 01:02:59.718
And you got him arrested for what you did.

01:02:59.868 --> 01:03:02.137
- Help me, Jenny!
- Then, tell me where Amy is!

01:03:02.287 --> 01:03:05.182
But I don't know where she is!
What are you saying?

01:03:05.332 --> 01:03:06.600
She wants to know where her brat is.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.685
Why don't you tell her
before you get your throat cut.

01:03:08.835 --> 01:03:11.188
- But I don't know where she is.
- "I don't know where she is."

01:03:11.338 --> 01:03:13.273
- I don't!
- Who are you talking to?

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:17.053
- I do. I took her to dear old Dad.
- Where? Where is he?

01:03:17.552 --> 01:03:19.600
Who are you talking to?

01:03:21.639 --> 01:03:23.742
Where's Amy? Where have you taken her?

01:03:23.892 --> 01:03:26.494
Taken her? Taken her where?

01:03:26.644 --> 01:03:31.024
She's... she's... She's... with my father.

01:03:31.191 --> 01:03:35.420
Your father? What are you saying?
Your father is dead!

01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:38.673
No, no. He's not dead. He's here.

01:03:38.823 --> 01:03:41.426
Amy's with him. She's fine.

01:03:41.676 --> 01:03:45.096
- Tell her, Cain. Tell her! She's fine.
- Dr. O'Keefe?

01:03:45.246 --> 01:03:48.074
- Why won't you tell her? Come on, tell her!
- Lieutenant Terri, Bay View Police!

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:50.477
- Carter, get up. Carter, get up.
- Dr. O'Keefe?

01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:53.230
- Tell her, Cain! Tell her!
- You all right?

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.565
Tell her Amy's fine!
Why won't you tell her?

01:03:55.715 --> 01:03:57.067
Dr. O'Keefe?

01:03:57.217 --> 01:03:59.778
- You've got to tell her. Tell her.
- Get up.

01:03:59.928 --> 01:04:00.975
Dr. O'Keefe?

01:04:03.056 --> 01:04:05.200
According to Norwegian authorities,

01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:09.355
Dr. Nix took a swan dive
into a fjord 18 years ago.

01:04:09.521 --> 01:04:13.492
There was a suicide note,
but they never recovered the body.

01:04:14.609 --> 01:04:17.587
Great. Carter says
they're with his father.

01:04:17.737 --> 01:04:21.833
His father's been dead for 18 years.
This gets better all the time.

01:04:22.283 --> 01:04:25.287
Let's hope Waldheim can get
something out of this psycho.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.883
Excuse me, here's your coffee,
Dr. Waldheim.

01:04:32.961 --> 01:04:39.139
When I got myself out of the car,
I could only think of one thing.

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:46.270
If he was crazy enough to kill me,
what was he gonna do to Amy?

01:04:48.226 --> 01:04:50.399
So then I went home...

01:04:52.439 --> 01:04:55.113
but she wasn't there.

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:57.869
That's when I called you.

01:05:00.447 --> 01:05:02.666
And then Carter came home.

01:05:07.787 --> 01:05:10.711
I just wanted him to tell me
where Amy was.

01:05:17.797 --> 01:05:20.391
Oh...

01:05:21.301 --> 01:05:25.822
Well, let's hope he's not too nuts.

01:05:25.972 --> 01:05:28.241
What do you mean?

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.940
Too nuts to go to jail.

01:05:31.102 --> 01:05:33.705
You mean he might not go to jail?

01:05:33.855 --> 01:05:37.083
First, we've got to find out
if he's competent to stand trial.

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:38.293
And even if he is,

01:05:38.443 --> 01:05:41.947
any smart lawyer will plead him
not guilty by reason of insanity.

01:05:42.155 --> 01:05:44.924
And depending on what Waldheim finds out,

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:49.763
Carter could wind up a celebrity
mental case in some cushy institution.

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:54.089
- He might be out someday?
- All he's got to do is get better.

01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:01.649
Fascinating.

01:06:01.799 --> 01:06:05.278
It's quite something,
after writing about him for years,

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:06.946
to finally meet him.

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:08.615
Carter is Cain.

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:12.144
And Josh and Margo and God knows who else.

01:06:13.228 --> 01:06:18.530
Now it is clear to me how Dr. Nix
got all his precise data.

01:06:19.359 --> 01:06:21.461
He traumatized his own son.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:25.912
Then, over the years,
he observed the effects.

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:30.887
- Does Carter know what he did?
- Carter didn't do anything.

01:06:31.037 --> 01:06:33.256
Cain did all the killing.

01:06:34.165 --> 01:06:37.394
- Who is Cain?
- One of Carter's multiples.

01:06:37.544 --> 01:06:41.815
One of the ones Dr. Nix created
when he abused him as a child.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:44.359
When something bad
is about to happen to Carter

01:06:44.509 --> 01:06:47.487
or when something bad has to be done,

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:50.811
Carter blacks out and Cain takes over.

01:06:51.766 --> 01:06:55.787
After the unpleasantness,
Cain exits and Carter wakes up.

01:06:55.937 --> 01:07:00.500
He has lost some time. He doesn't
remember how he got where he is

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.211
or what happened while he was asleep.

01:07:03.361 --> 01:07:07.286
He may be confused,
but his conscience is clean.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:13.513
So how do we find the children?

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:20.186
Carter doesn't know where they are,
but one of the other multiples may.

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:22.088
And how do we talk to them?

01:07:23.131 --> 01:07:28.103
Hypnotism is the fastest, though
not always the most prudent method.

01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:30.684
We've got to find these babies now.

01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:35.743
Then, I will need
an absolutely quiet space

01:07:35.893 --> 01:07:38.112
where I can be alone with Carter.

01:07:38.271 --> 01:07:40.865
Whatever you need, and do it fast.

01:07:42.025 --> 01:07:45.120
I don't wanna be walking
behind any little coffins.

01:07:46.404 --> 01:07:48.247
It's all right.

01:07:48.573 --> 01:07:50.621
We'll find them.

01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:01.594
She doesn't care who she fucks
or where she does it.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.814
But don't worry, buddy.

01:08:04.964 --> 01:08:08.935
I'm not gonna let that loving wife
of yours sell you down the river.

01:08:09.594 --> 01:08:10.862
Once we get out of here,

01:08:11.012 --> 01:08:14.482
I'm gonna put that two-timing bitch
in a box she'll never swim out of.

01:08:17.143 --> 01:08:18.286
Hey...

01:08:18.435 --> 01:08:19.453
You remember that lady cop

01:08:19.604 --> 01:08:23.279
with the rat's nest for a hairdo
that brought Waldheim her coffee?

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:28.087
Take a look down at your feet.

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:32.707
Don't be so obvious! Jesus.

01:08:37.497 --> 01:08:41.421
Keep your head up. Now reach down.

01:08:46.005 --> 01:08:48.383
Down...

01:08:50.843 --> 01:08:52.685
Down...

01:08:53.888 --> 01:08:57.017
And pick it up.

01:08:58.475 --> 01:09:00.478
Good boy.

01:09:03.022 --> 01:09:05.524
Carter, you're awake now.

01:09:06.024 --> 01:09:10.781
I am a doctor, and I am here
to help you. Do you understand?

01:09:12.573 --> 01:09:14.575
Carter?

01:09:19.663 --> 01:09:20.974
Are you talking to me?

01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:23.546
Yes, I'm talking to you.

01:09:23.876 --> 01:09:27.604
Carter, pay attention.
You have to answer my questions

01:09:27.755 --> 01:09:31.100
so I will be able to understand
what is going on.

01:09:31.259 --> 01:09:33.636
Is that perfectly clear?

01:09:35.011 --> 01:09:37.231
- No.
- Why?

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:41.189
Because I'm not Carter.

01:09:41.352 --> 01:09:43.955
- You're not Carter?
- No.

01:09:44.104 --> 01:09:48.861
Wait a minute. If you're not Carter,
then, who are you?

01:09:49.277 --> 01:09:51.004
I'm Josh.

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:52.921
Josh.

01:09:53.072 --> 01:09:58.249
- And where is Carter?
- Carter's inside.

01:09:58.411 --> 01:10:00.505
Inside where?

01:10:01.289 --> 01:10:03.725
Can you wake him up so I can talk to him?

01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:06.799
- No.
- Why?

01:10:07.253 --> 01:10:09.176
Bamse would hurt me.

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:13.693
- Who is Bamse?
- Bamse's my dad.

01:10:13.843 --> 01:10:16.863
But your father isn't here anymore.
He's dead.

01:10:17.013 --> 01:10:22.410
No, no! He's here. I gotta go.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.235
Your father isn't here now, Josh,
so you don't have to be afraid.

01:10:26.397 --> 01:10:27.957
He'll hurt me.

01:10:28.107 --> 01:10:32.032
No, he can't hurt you now.
I won't let him.

01:10:33.946 --> 01:10:36.049
- You won't?
- No.

01:10:36.199 --> 01:10:40.045
- You promise?
- Yes, I promise.

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:43.918
Okay.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.214
- How old are you, Josh?
- Seven and a half.

01:10:47.585 --> 01:10:51.135
Why are you the one
who came to talk to me?

01:10:51.297 --> 01:10:53.566
I don't know.

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:57.346
- Why are you here?
- I don't know!

01:10:57.595 --> 01:10:59.438
Well, try to think.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:03.477
What is the last thing
that you remember, hmm?

01:11:06.687 --> 01:11:09.874
- I was in a playground.
- A playground.

01:11:10.024 --> 01:11:12.072
And what happened?

01:11:14.445 --> 01:11:16.197
Get out of here!

01:11:19.242 --> 01:11:21.719
I saw Cain.

01:11:21.869 --> 01:11:26.933
He was gonna do something bad,
something I'd be blamed for.

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:30.103
I told him it was bad!
Then I woke up Margo, and I told her.

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:33.678
She got real mad!
She told me to go to sleep!

01:11:34.799 --> 01:11:37.302
Then I woke up here.

01:11:41.222 --> 01:11:43.941
My... My arm hurts.

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:50.498
- That's why I'm here.
- Could you explain that?

01:11:50.648 --> 01:11:53.793
- That's what Margo says.
- Margo.

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:55.365
That's what she says.

01:11:55.528 --> 01:11:58.881
Hickory dickory dock.
Cain has picked his lock.

01:11:59.031 --> 01:12:02.093
He did a bad deed,
and Josh comes to bleed.

01:12:02.243 --> 01:12:03.916
Hickory dickory dock.

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:06.222
Josh...

01:12:06.372 --> 01:12:11.503
Everything is all right.
Everything is all right.

01:12:14.255 --> 01:12:16.678
Do you know where the babies are?

01:12:22.221 --> 01:12:23.781
What babies?

01:12:23.931 --> 01:12:26.075
Someone took the babies and hid them.

01:12:26.225 --> 01:12:27.535
No, no, no...

01:12:27.685 --> 01:12:29.858
Now, nobody is
going to get punished for this.

01:12:30.021 --> 01:12:31.789
- No, no, no...
- I just want to know where they are.

01:12:31.939 --> 01:12:37.696
He did it again!
It was Bamse! He did it again!

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:41.799
Oh, no.

01:12:41.949 --> 01:12:44.202
- What's the matter?
- Shh!

01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:48.473
- She heard me.
- Who heard you?

01:12:48.623 --> 01:12:50.600
Margo.

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:53.845
She's right behind you. Don't look!

01:12:55.296 --> 01:12:57.231
I shouldn't be talking to you.

01:12:57.381 --> 01:12:59.692
How do you know she heard you?

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:04.822
She's staring right at me,
like I did something bad.

01:13:04.972 --> 01:13:09.494
- Who is Margo?
- She protects the children.

01:13:09.644 --> 01:13:13.080
She won't let Bamse hurt them,
like he hurt me.

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:16.083
When he tried to take the children
before, she called up the police,

01:13:16.233 --> 01:13:17.376
and they stopped him.

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.462
- She called the police?
- Yes.

01:13:19.612 --> 01:13:22.381
But you said that he did it again.

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:24.033
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

01:13:24.492 --> 01:13:26.928
She won't just call the police this time.

01:13:27.078 --> 01:13:29.422
- What is she going to do?
- I don't know.

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:33.301
I've gotta get out of here. Where is she?

01:13:40.216 --> 01:13:43.110
Carter? Carter? Josh?

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:45.479
Josh, I want to talk to you.

01:13:45.638 --> 01:13:48.391
When I snap my fingers,
you are going to wake up.

01:14:05.992 --> 01:14:07.835
Josh?

01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:16.085
Is this Margo?

01:14:21.841 --> 01:14:24.640
Do you know where the children are?

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:31.358
Where?

01:16:50.865 --> 01:16:52.993
Dr. Waldheim?

01:16:54.034 --> 01:16:55.877
Dr. Waldheim?

01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:58.213
Dr. Waldheim!

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:02.418
Did he tell you where Amy is?

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.604
Where's Amy, Dr. Waldheim?

01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:13.881
My God! My God!

01:18:14.031 --> 01:18:16.033
Help! Help!

01:18:30.881 --> 01:18:32.599
What's the matter with you guys?

01:18:33.092 --> 01:18:35.936
You almost took those people out!
What's the matter with you?

01:18:36.595 --> 01:18:39.018
Are you blitzed again?

01:18:47.064 --> 01:18:49.959
What if I tried to take it
out of your pay?! Huh?

01:18:50.109 --> 01:18:54.880
Hey! Hey, guys, guys. Come on, Manuel.

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:58.455
Manuel, you almost took
the taxicab with ya.

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:04.014
You almost took the cab with you.

01:19:04.164 --> 01:19:06.383
You gotta take this thing
and move it there.

01:19:06.792 --> 01:19:10.412
Move the truck. Put it over there
out of the people's way.

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:24.618
Carter knocked out Waldheim and escaped.

01:19:24.768 --> 01:19:25.661
Let's go. Yeah?

01:19:25.811 --> 01:19:27.955
- It's Jenny O'Keefe.
- Where are you?

01:19:28.105 --> 01:19:30.499
I'm at the Riviera Motel
at Camino and 3rd.

01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:31.834
I followed Waldheim here.

01:19:31.984 --> 01:19:35.004
That's not Waldheim. Just stay put.

01:19:35.154 --> 01:19:38.954
- Stay put. We'll be right over!
- I gotta go.

01:19:41.452 --> 01:19:42.970
Jesus, man! Whoa! Stop!

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.639
You're gonna kill somebody
with that sundial!

01:19:45.789 --> 01:19:47.962
Calm down, Señor.

01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:51.395
Okay. Uh... Stop!

01:19:51.545 --> 01:19:54.098
Okay, now back it up.

01:20:54.441 --> 01:20:57.711
- Mommy!
- Oh, my God.

01:20:57.861 --> 01:21:01.491
- Mommy!
- So, this is my daughter-in-law.

01:21:02.408 --> 01:21:03.968
My God! What kind of a mother are you?

01:21:04.118 --> 01:21:05.916
Put that knife down and come out of there.

01:21:06.078 --> 01:21:10.709
- Give me my child!
- I want my mommy!

01:21:11.458 --> 01:21:14.353
I have a gun. It's pointed at your heart.

01:21:14.503 --> 01:21:17.439
Now, if you have anything
to say to me, say it gently.

01:21:17.589 --> 01:21:20.234
I don't want you upsetting the child.

01:21:20.384 --> 01:21:24.355
You're her mother.
You're scared and angry.

01:21:24.888 --> 01:21:29.143
And if looks could kill, my dear,
I would be dead.

01:21:30.978 --> 01:21:33.731
I want my mommy!

01:21:35.774 --> 01:21:39.620
It's okay, honey. I'm here now,
and we're gonna go home.

01:21:40.571 --> 01:21:43.916
Now, drop the knife and come out of there.

01:21:56.879 --> 01:21:59.565
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't have time to explain.

01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:03.515
- Carter is waiting for me downstairs.
- Carter isn't there.

01:22:03.677 --> 01:22:06.530
I want my mommy!

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.682
You're a poor liar, my dear.

01:22:09.433 --> 01:22:12.482
Carter always does as he's told.
He's a good boy.

01:22:13.645 --> 01:22:16.498
Once we're all safely away,
he'll be yours again.

01:22:16.648 --> 01:22:19.209
But you might have to share him
with the law.

01:22:19.359 --> 01:22:22.504
Someone will have to pay
for all these terrible crimes.

01:22:22.654 --> 01:22:25.749
- You did this.
- I did nothing.

01:22:26.283 --> 01:22:28.801
I don't even exist.

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:34.337
Now say good-bye to Amy,
and don't upset her.

01:22:35.125 --> 01:22:36.101
Can I kiss her?

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.549
No, stay where you are.
Don't force me to kill you here.

01:22:39.129 --> 01:22:41.257
It would be very harmful to the child.

01:22:44.384 --> 01:22:47.183
Damn you! Look what you've done!

01:23:03.904 --> 01:23:05.923
Mommy!

01:23:06.073 --> 01:23:07.791
- Back up!
- Mommy!

01:23:10.244 --> 01:23:12.121
Back up!

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:15.131
- Now!
- Mommy!

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.468
- Back up!
- Mommy!

01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:21.426
Do it!

01:23:41.692 --> 01:23:45.071
She's not there. Let's go around front.
Stay in the car!

01:26:21.393 --> 01:26:23.662
We all thought Carter
was imagining his dead father.

01:26:23.812 --> 01:26:24.913
But he wasn't.

01:26:25.063 --> 01:26:28.784
Dr. Nix faked his suicide so that
he could kidnap the children

01:26:28.942 --> 01:26:31.712
and not have the problem of the police
tracking him down.

01:26:31.862 --> 01:26:34.615
What about tracking down his son?

01:26:34.865 --> 01:26:38.244
Once Carter helped him get the kids,
he was disposable.

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:42.502
Dr. Nix planned to disappear
and leave Carter for the police.

01:26:42.914 --> 01:26:45.167
Did they find him yet?

01:26:45.792 --> 01:26:47.135
Mm-mm.

01:26:47.294 --> 01:26:49.388
You think he'll come back?

01:26:50.464 --> 01:26:54.094
I don't know. I hope so. He needs help.

01:26:54.259 --> 01:26:58.113
- He needs to be locked up.
- He needs to be in a hospital.

01:26:58.263 --> 01:27:00.907
What are you doing? Running for sainthood?

01:27:01.057 --> 01:27:04.982
- He tried to kill you.
- I know.

01:27:05.187 --> 01:27:08.316
Well, just in case he shows up,
I'd be packing a .45.

01:27:08.565 --> 01:27:11.284
Well, Jack's staying with me now, so...

01:27:11.443 --> 01:27:14.822
Better than a .45. How's it going?

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:18.550
Good. He's been very supportive.

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.677
And Amy likes him.

01:27:20.827 --> 01:27:22.971
Did you see the new bunny he brought her?

01:27:23.121 --> 01:27:24.543
Amy!

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.924
Amy? I'll be right back.

01:27:30.462 --> 01:27:32.430
Amy!

01:27:46.186 --> 01:27:48.188
Amy?

01:27:57.489 --> 01:27:59.537
Amy!

01:28:05.997 --> 01:28:07.999
Amy?

01:28:15.966 --> 01:28:17.684
Where's Daddy?

01:28:17.926 --> 01:28:20.645
Daddy's not here, sweetie. He's gone away.

01:28:20.971 --> 01:28:24.145
- Daddy's here.
- No, he's not.

01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.352
Come on, honey, we've got to get back.

01:28:26.518 --> 01:28:28.816
Come to Mommy.
