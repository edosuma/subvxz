00:57.473 --> 01:02.526
In order to protect habitat.
Follow the paths.

01:47.190 --> 01:51.036
Shuttle 11S1 and BAXTER-satellite, air traffic control calls
-

01:51.194 --> 01:54.789
and makes the registration of
at 01:00.

01:55.449 --> 01:59.076
Minus three minutes to launch.

01:59.077 --> 02:03.548
OSM, third stage. Lock
S & A, you are authorized to close.

02:03.707 --> 02:07.462
SSC, third stage S & A locked.

02:08.127 --> 02:14.511
One of the pillars, the fuel tank open.
- Fuel hose is cleaned.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.473
SSC, the number one valve
thermal management out of it.

02:21.975 --> 02:27.232
SSC, second valve
thermal management out of it.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.614

Time of about 30 seconds. SSC,
hydraulic external energy on.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.576
Up and down 100%.

02:40.577 --> 02:45.122

02:47.834 --> 02:52.214
Right. Shot 20 seconds.
Prepare to go.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.265
Weather unchanged,

03:24.996 --> 03:30.878
Congratulations, Palatier. A great performance
Vasglobelta and from yourself.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.678
Thank you for Gibbons.

03:37.175 --> 03:40.304
Is everything all right?

03:42.514 --> 03:49.489
Ylitämmekö our authority
watching the world like this?

03:50.939 --> 03:55.693
Do we deserve this...
divine power?

03:55.694 --> 04:02.077
Depends on point of view. This is only a supplement
wonders of the world.

04:03.034 --> 04:08.289
Examination of the work of art with a magnifying glass does not detract from the elements -

04:08.290 --> 04:14.514
but only reveal things. -
, They may not supposed to see.

04:16.548 --> 04:20.176
So, after all, it is true.

04:20.177 --> 04:26.560
BAXTER  is in orbit. Time
output, 6 minutes, 13 seconds.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.046
Jamie, I'm home.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.641
That's cool here.

05:09.351 --> 05:13.106
I talked to Mike Johnson.

05:14.815 --> 05:21.243
We talked about Christmas. I said that
we do not have any Christmas Eve.

05:27.077 --> 05:33.961
I thought that Ruby's choir sung
five o'clock Mass -

05:34.835 --> 05:39.636
would be nice to go to them.

05:41.258 --> 05:47.555
They always invest to Christmas.
Ruby? Dad came home.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.730
Jamie, I guess you did not put
star tree without me?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.358
For...

06:02.070 --> 06:06.450
Ruby, eat your food.
- It's too hot.

06:07.325 --> 06:12.126
Blow. - I look forward to
it cools down.

06:19.588 --> 06:24.800
What are you doing?
- I eat these out.

06:24.801 --> 06:29.352
I do not want to waste food again.
- It's not your bread, Rich.

06:30.098 --> 06:34.774
Jamie, it's not anyone's food.
We have already talked about this.

06:36.688 --> 06:42.036
My kids are eating, when the table is set.
And I'm covered.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.991
And that's Robbyn place.
- Will Robby back?

06:56.416 --> 06:58.510
I'm sorry.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.342
You're right.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.970
You're cleaned well, girls.

07:09.846 --> 07:13.933
Do not dispose of stars without me.
It's our thing.

07:13.934 --> 07:20.032
There we no longer have stars.
But the angel Robbylle.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.242
Well.

07:27.656 --> 07:32.753
You are both dear to my angels.

08:48.737 --> 08:52.833
See, Abby. There we live.

08:55.160 --> 08:59.461
Sometimes life is much more beautiful,
when you look at it from a distance.

09:02.333 --> 09:08.807
Abby, come on. What is a girl?

11:22.348 --> 11:25.443
Why did you sleep with clothes on?

12:12.607 --> 12:17.408
I bought you a Father's Day pajama.
I do not think it was so horrible?

12:48.184 --> 12:50.687
Hello, Richard Hadley.

13:04.284 --> 13:08.370
Well, would you say your name clearly
camera?

13:08.371 --> 13:14.378
Richard Hadley.
I-R-C-H-A-D-D or H-A-D-L-E-Y.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.765
Well done, Mr. Hadley. Welcome to the
Chris Hapshow program.

13:18.766 --> 13:26.388
Our guest is Mr. Hadley.
More and more people are aware of Baxter.

13:26.389 --> 13:30.642
Tell me more about it?
- BAXTER means -

13:30.643 --> 13:36.189
bi-linear, axial thermal
receiver. Monitoring Satellite.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.615
It allows the armed forces
detect foreign objects -

13:39.616 --> 13:43.447
spectrometry and thermodynamically the earth's surface.

13:43.448 --> 13:47.409
Could you open that?
- Sure.

13:47.410 --> 13:52.247
Spectrometric measurement is a way of
to measure the energy and mass -

13:52.248 --> 13:55.593
termoenergia and, of course, related to
lämpökeskittymiin.

13:55.594 --> 14:00.547
By combining these techniques can be
to detect all of the Earth's surface -

14:00.548 --> 14:03.258
and explore it from space.

14:03.259 --> 14:11.259
Thus, terrorist organizations through
used by the world's radar jamming -

14:11.559 --> 14:19.232
sites and projects to conceal
will be obsolete technology?

14:19.233 --> 14:23.528
Right. - Wow,
quite an accomplishment.

14:23.529 --> 14:29.451
We are very proud Vasglobesta.
The biggest thank you is Edgar Palatierin.

14:29.452 --> 14:36.333
He was the originator of the project.
-He Was here last week. The intelligent man.

14:36.334 --> 14:40.420
Could you tell inclusion
Vasglobe project?

14:40.421 --> 14:48.053
I receive information.
Interviews and press releases.

14:48.054 --> 14:53.185
I believe that the world must be
the right information puuhistamme.

14:55.395 --> 15:00.941
When this super satellite is now in orbit
...

15:00.942 --> 15:04.196
Please explain why Americans
can sleep better.

15:04.946 --> 15:10.419
Well, I imagine that it brings people
-

15:11.452 --> 15:15.878
a certain sense of certainty
images and details.

15:17.625 --> 15:24.804
Evidence for the existence of one. Thus
no longer need to guess.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.350
Do not need to think about whether
a fact or fiction.

15:29.351 --> 15:34.852
Right. Thank you, Mr. Hadley.
It would be in it.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.839
Abby, go home.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.126
Where were you?

20:16.340 --> 20:19.389
I waited for you last night, Rich.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.602
Where were you?

20:25.474 --> 20:27.727
Reply to Rich.

20:29.979 --> 20:36.533
Where have you been last nights?
You have not spoken to me.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.452
You will not even looked at.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.161
What is going on?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.459
I have seen something.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.464
It's crazy.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.809
I do not know what, but -

21:03.095 --> 21:05.814
it is magical.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.635
You saw it, Abby. Or what?

21:43.302 --> 21:45.896
Yes you saw.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.429
Is it something new? - None.

22:28.430 --> 22:33.852
First broadcast in an hour.
- Gibbons wanted to be involved.

22:33.853 --> 22:39.485
He told me to send the data in it.
I'll be back.

22:57.001 --> 23:00.175
Baxter thermal imaging ready to
7435980 deviation found

25:28.610 --> 25:34.333
You have then you have seen them.
I can see it in your eyes.

25:34.491 --> 25:39.622
It is a rare and unfortunate sight.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.504
You are a lucky man.

25:43.542 --> 25:48.343
You have a lot of questions,
and I have a lot of answers.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.507
Sit.

27:02.246 --> 27:07.458
Tick any checkboxes are portals.
Niistähän you know.

27:07.459 --> 27:11.879
Portals? - Yes, they
Light buoys.

27:11.880 --> 27:17.432
March opens, and send them to the
to the skies as a school of fish.

27:18.178 --> 27:22.684
Send  what up? - The souls.

27:48.417 --> 27:52.718
Last night, how the portal.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.012
There.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.433
What are they?

28:01.180 --> 28:03.433
What is your name?

28:06.143 --> 28:09.443
Rich. - Well, Rich.

28:09.938 --> 28:15.651
This means that the dead are among us
. I hate the idea.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.113
After his time in purgatory...
- Purgatory?

28:19.114 --> 28:23.494
March spits out the insides
as the bad-tasting piece of meat.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.295
But how?

28:30.042 --> 28:34.013
If they are picked, they go to heaven
portals.

28:34.014 --> 28:42.014
If it is rejected... They catch fire
and ash raining down back to the ground.

28:44.431 --> 28:47.230
One was left yesterday.
As you saw.

28:50.520 --> 28:55.822
All these charts and tables...

28:56.902 --> 29:00.247
Sieltäkö them you found?

29:00.822 --> 29:06.670
Their search takes a lifetime.
I will not change no longer part of all.

29:07.287 --> 29:10.006
That's what happens to you soon.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.170
How do you know all this?

29:15.587 --> 29:18.841
I died once.

29:20.467 --> 29:25.689
But I remember everything I saw there.

29:27.057 --> 29:34.111
This purgatory and hell 9
circuit, just as Dante predicted.

29:36.942 --> 29:44.417
The doctor from my heart started
I have seen all the more clearly.

29:45.450 --> 29:50.547
I've atoned for my sins,
but I know what I experienced.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.926
You will look for souls rest of your life.

29:57.963 --> 30:03.891
Still see all of them?
Why did not I know?

30:04.970 --> 30:07.393
Cover your eyes.

30:11.310 --> 30:15.360
Can you see me? - I do not.

30:17.858 --> 30:23.160
I see thee? - Yes
probably, if you look.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.531
Right.

30:25.532 --> 30:28.957
We both have to want to see each other.

30:30.329 --> 30:35.041
Dead  appear only for those who really want
to see.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.591
And...

30:38.503 --> 30:42.131
They live deep in your heart.

30:42.132 --> 30:46.093
Those who have that gift
see the same as you.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.517
They will see more than just the world.

30:49.556 --> 30:53.060
No one has talked about this.
- Are you gonna talk about?

30:55.687 --> 30:58.110
I do not.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.486
Why not?

31:07.532 --> 31:09.830
Well.

31:11.119 --> 31:17.377
I'm sorry if I was rude.
You do not even know my name.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.214
Lou Demoine.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.597
Very nice to meet you.

31:26.343 --> 31:32.521
You have not been drinking your water, Rich.
There seems to be a little sugar...

31:36.019 --> 31:38.317
Hey, only Lou.

31:40.482 --> 31:42.610
Rich!

32:15.642 --> 32:19.812
Hey, you called Richard Hadley,
Vasgloben information to the master.

32:19.813 --> 32:27.197
I do not return to work before...
I do not know when.

32:27.863 --> 32:31.907
If you need assistance, please contact Wayne Peterson
-

32:31.908 --> 32:37.881
personal counseling,
ext 891 Thank you and bye.

33:06.359 --> 33:11.365
Jamie! Jamie, wake up.

33:11.990 --> 33:16.118
Rich. Were you out again?
- Get up now.

33:16.119 --> 33:20.873
Where are you going? What is this? -
I have to leave for a short period of time.

33:20.874 --> 33:24.001
Go to awaken Ruby.
- Where are you going?

33:24.002 --> 33:27.546
A small trip. - Where to?

33:27.547 --> 33:35.012
I might be able to find Robbyn and save him.
I might be crazy -

33:35.013 --> 33:39.484
but this explanation would be even more difficult than
not to explain.

33:39.485 --> 33:45.449
Is needed confidence. As if
when you fall backward, and someone -

33:45.607 --> 33:49.362
will receive you. Confidently
downfall. That's what this is.

33:49.363 --> 33:54.114
Rich, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing!

33:54.115 --> 33:58.285
There is nothing wrong with me.
I am sure of this.

33:58.286 --> 34:03.042
Who said that the dead can return to the
?

34:03.750 --> 34:08.754
Dear. I know that this seems like a
crazy, but do not worry. Ruby!

34:08.755 --> 34:13.726
Do not bother to wake him up.
- There is nothing to worry about. Ruby!

34:16.137 --> 34:20.108
Honey, come back to bed.
- Hey, pumpkin.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.688
Now look what you've done.
- Stop that, Jamie.

34:26.690 --> 34:32.570
Listen. You know that I
walked out last night.

34:32.571 --> 34:39.284
Abby walks in the canyon,
when I saw the beam of light.

34:39.286 --> 34:45.708
She saw it, too. It was a portal,
this vortex up to the heavens -

34:45.708 --> 34:52.137
and the earth opened as a small
volcano, and the people...

34:52.299 --> 34:58.721
They had a  urns and bags,
, and they collected them, souls!

34:58.722 --> 35:03.774
Do not you understand? - I really do not.

35:05.312 --> 35:11.984
I can find Robbyn and talk to him.
No, you can not blame me.

35:11.985 --> 35:16.707
I do not you should.
I do not blame did not know, Rich.

35:18.158 --> 35:24.632
Is that what this is all about? In this case, the
I'm sorry.

35:27.876 --> 35:34.214
Maybe you go to talk to someone? Debbie.
Henderson recommended.

35:34.215 --> 35:39.678
Settle this mess. Please,
do not bother to be like that.

35:39.679 --> 35:45.225
Be what? I'm serious.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.320
Listen.

35:48.938 --> 35:54.526
Write Robbylle. Something
want me to say to him.

35:54.527 --> 36:01.001
I will say just about anything. Write
message from you and Rubylta.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.627
Jamie, you do not write.

36:06.331 --> 36:11.007
Write  now!
The Lord's sake, get me...

36:11.961 --> 36:18.685
I am afraid of you.
I do not understand what is happening and why.

36:19.469 --> 36:23.940
But please stop.

36:29.813 --> 36:33.488
Two days is Christmas Eve.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.953
I'm sorry.

36:43.952 --> 36:46.580
I have to do this.

36:51.751 --> 36:59.133
The last goodbye. The soul can get back to the physical form of human
-

36:59.134 --> 37:05.141
a while. Then it thank
pickers delivery -

37:05.974 --> 37:10.354
and say the last goodbye
before leaving the country.

37:12.605 --> 37:17.987
All those people. .Jotka See
overnight glassy eyes.

37:19.112 --> 37:23.866
With a selection of boxes,
urns, whatever.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.785
What do they only get their hands on.

37:26.786 --> 37:31.587
They picked up the souls. Dead
dear and close.

37:33.168 --> 37:40.052
They will find the soul through the
sleep and send it to heaven.

37:41.926 --> 37:46.853
But if the soul is not
anyone who cares...

37:48.975 --> 37:53.312
If no one has the
loved, it's black soul.

37:53.313 --> 37:57.864
Then it stays here and
returns to the fire of hell.

38:01.112 --> 38:05.492
When the obsession takes over,
, nothing is insignificant.

38:06.075 --> 38:12.208
Moments in life are the signs.
Questions remain unanswered.

38:14.709 --> 38:19.055
The riddle remains the norm.

39:11.349 --> 39:15.769
Provide details of the afternoon.
Paper.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.365
Right. Right.

39:20.275 --> 39:25.031
Yeah? - This was the night
Baxter.

39:26.906 --> 39:30.376
It is a graph of the
south-western parts of the above.

39:35.582 --> 39:39.835
What does it mean, Gibbons?
- It can be anything.

39:39.836 --> 39:43.090
It can be something
very dangerous.

39:43.256 --> 39:48.604
It may even be a fault Baxter
.

39:48.845 --> 39:53.891
Impossible. - The thing is, however,
investigated.

39:53.892 --> 39:57.436
A test very carefully.

39:57.437 --> 40:04.776
Preparing to. 0 degrees Kelvin is impossible to implement
artificially.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.371
Physically impossible.

40:08.489 --> 40:12.784
20 years ago the Baxter
was considered impossible.

40:12.785 --> 40:17.539
Something is amiss.
Absolute zero is the theory.

40:17.540 --> 40:22.252
The nearest equivalent is one of the
nebuloosa in outer space.

40:22.253 --> 40:26.256
High school chemistry student can say
impossibility.

40:26.257 --> 40:31.762
I do not ask for anything in the status report.
I like you worried about -

40:31.763 --> 40:36.642
seriousness of the situation and the theoretical impossibility.

40:36.643 --> 40:42.491
I ask you the experience-based
your perception of all this.

40:44.359 --> 40:49.081
What it is, it
is not of this world.

42:38.765 --> 42:43.191
Who are you? Can be more embarrassing

42:44.228 --> 42:50.358
?

42:50.359 --> 42:54.159
What else should I say?
- That's just more embarrassment.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.448
He's trying to say that it would be in place to greet
. That's right.

42:56.449 --> 43:01.536
Hi. - Hi.

43:01.537 --> 43:06.750
Piikittelet Why is it always me? Not
you need me to observe.

43:06.751 --> 43:12.303
I do not observe, but to fix.
Otherwise, you do not learn from your mistakes.

43:13.132 --> 43:17.385
What is your name, stranger?
- Rich.

43:17.386 --> 43:21.357
Hey, Rich. - Hey, I'm...

43:23.351 --> 43:26.821
No need to explain, we are friendly to
.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.858
I'm sorry, I'm Grace. - Grace?

43:31.859 --> 43:34.569
Grace and all the other...
- Jermaine.

43:34.570 --> 43:39.792
Andrew. - Where's Arnie?

43:41.327 --> 43:43.546
I do not care. - I'm sorry,
that I came to disturb.

43:44.372 --> 43:49.720
I forgive you.

43:53.297 --> 43:59.555
We come here every night.
Not just here, but every night.

43:59.720 --> 44:06.518
We have a kind of tradition.
- Kutsumuksellinen obsession.

44:06.519 --> 44:13.567
Hobby, which includes
camping and viewing.

44:13.568 --> 44:19.416
We do not look at the stars. For it
is not in the sky, but in the country.

44:19.574 --> 44:27.372
Watch in the country to see them.
You seem to know what I'm talking about.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.922
You were actually the same errand.

44:32.044 --> 44:37.551
How you know? - No
a lot of people move here.

44:39.886 --> 44:43.936
And you have that look.
- What's gaze?

44:46.142 --> 44:48.440
As you would have seen God.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.241
Now is the time.

46:14.397 --> 46:19.574
You do not sleep a lot?
- I'm not at night.

46:21.153 --> 46:25.031
I have become in recent weeks
night person.

46:25.032 --> 46:30.630
The same with us. Hard to sleep when the
at night so much is happening.

46:33.916 --> 46:39.004
I hope I do not switch off the idea.
You looked intently.

46:39.005 --> 46:46.105
I thought.
I watched only.

46:48.848 --> 46:53.149
I try not to think about anymore.
Yes, it is easier.

46:57.106 --> 47:01.577
But I would like to ask you something.
- Let's hear it.

47:05.990 --> 47:10.587
How the information can live with?
When you know -

47:12.913 --> 47:16.588
that God really exists.

47:17.501 --> 47:21.847
You know it before thinking...

47:22.006 --> 47:26.136
Because the Church says so, and
parents say their child.

47:27.386 --> 47:30.515
Back of the head was still always the suspicion.

47:34.185 --> 47:37.979
When you do something bad -

47:37.980 --> 47:43.987
can convince himself that God does not exist.
No, it's not so bad.

47:47.073 --> 47:51.203
Then you're doing something good, and you say:

47:51.994 --> 47:55.089
"Okay, God,
reward me."

47:58.084 --> 48:03.432
That it is true
beyond comprehension.

48:07.635 --> 48:09.763
Thats us...

48:12.390 --> 48:15.485
Considered  so close eye on.

48:17.353 --> 48:22.075
You think pretty much the man,
who does not want to think about.

48:24.026 --> 48:30.159
I do not try to understand it.
Hulluksihan it should be.

48:31.492 --> 48:36.496
I try to live my heart and instinct, according to my.

48:36.497 --> 48:40.752
They are divine qualities in this world.

48:44.463 --> 48:49.970
You would be best to give the brain a rest
-

48:51.512 --> 48:57.645
and monitor the heart and soul.
So get to him.

48:59.353 --> 49:01.697
Thank you.

49:07.570 --> 49:09.823
Good night.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.900
Good morning, Richard. - Good morning.

49:39.059 --> 49:45.356
Where do tonight? Middle-aged
about 20 miles away.

49:45.357 --> 49:50.989
A couple of oldies 3 miles away.
Both start at 01.13.

49:51.155 --> 49:56.534
I want to see something new.
- Where's toddlers are?

49:56.535 --> 50:02.417
Forget them. Too depressing.
Little husbands are the best.

50:02.583 --> 50:08.056
Their loved ones wobble syrup...

50:09.256 --> 50:14.719
No, middle-aged
get the widest sampling.

50:14.720 --> 50:21.100
There are pimps, whores, gangsters and
proffia. Do you remember John McCainen?

50:21.101 --> 50:26.449
There one sees celebrities.
- This is how it is.

50:26.607 --> 50:31.945
Arnie, considered to be the elderly.
- I'm always in favor of the majority.

50:31.946 --> 50:34.239
You get to decide.

50:34.240 --> 50:39.417
What would you vote for Rich? -
How do you know all this?

50:40.371 --> 50:42.664
Where it all?

50:42.665 --> 50:50.140
Time, place, age. You know exactly
every night...

50:53.759 --> 50:56.638
We have documented the
outputs and pickers.

50:56.639 --> 51:03.268
After years begin to show a pattern.
The purgatory is on schedule.

51:03.269 --> 51:09.607
What about maps and spreadsheets, Rich?
- They look like just the place.

51:09.608 --> 51:15.832
You know, therefore, where, when and how
old souls are?

51:19.451 --> 51:22.000
Unbelievable.

51:23.330 --> 51:27.335
Rich is looking for his son, and we
help him search.

52:15.758 --> 52:20.845
Arnie, this is the place
but it does not start for a while yet.

52:20.846 --> 52:25.516
There is a place below,
which could see something -

52:25.517 --> 52:28.270
just a few minutes.
You're in control.

52:37.738 --> 52:40.116
It's nice, when it comes to
new people.

52:42.534 --> 52:47.210
I think it's nice that there is
other equally crazy as I am.

52:48.207 --> 52:53.008
You're not crazy, Rich.
You're just a crazy situation.

53:31.041 --> 53:34.887
Rich? What's going on?

53:36.255 --> 53:40.761
Rich? - He is Jamie, my wife.

53:43.053 --> 53:49.060
Rich, I do not think so. - He is the only
kyhjöttänyt at home.

53:49.810 --> 53:53.940
He does not even believe in, and now he gets
Robbyn first create a. No way!

53:54.106 --> 53:56.905
Rich! - I have to see Robby.

54:36.148 --> 54:40.699
Jamie... I'm sorry.

54:45.199 --> 54:47.418
Rich.

54:57.169 --> 54:59.763
Sorry, Rich.

55:05.177 --> 55:07.475
Who is he?

55:10.224 --> 55:12.602
His mother.

55:30.410 --> 55:35.957
There is a swing hard. The best thing to put
heavily armed men about it.

55:35.958 --> 55:39.252
The best husband.
Errors can not afford.

55:39.253 --> 55:42.507
Errors, Hobbs? It is the smallest
concern.

55:43.632 --> 55:47.557
This is not a war, but the research.
The Ministry of Security -

55:47.558 --> 55:52.775
is ready to provide any assistance
completely secure evacuation.

55:52.933 --> 55:56.563
You do not know what is needed there.
My husband can not cover everything.

55:56.564 --> 56:00.283
Your husband will not...
- We need to focus on...

56:03.443 --> 56:07.822
Lieutenant Commander Sterling.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

56:07.823 --> 56:12.454
I want to talk to you, gentlemen
Palatier and Gibbons.

56:14.079 --> 56:16.581
This is the then top secret.

56:16.582 --> 56:22.587
The President sent a special forces operation
10 years ago.

56:22.588 --> 56:27.633
"Operation Firefly". Only 3 people
in the White House knew about it -

56:27.634 --> 56:32.390
and it soon swept under the carpet
twin towers after impact.

56:34.141 --> 56:39.562
Drones looked the same as BAXTER now.

56:39.563 --> 56:42.863
This image southwestern area.

56:43.442 --> 56:48.243
None of the technology does not explain the phenomenon,
but this was a thermal camera.

56:55.829 --> 57:02.132
At night, something strange happens,
, and has been ever since.

57:02.628 --> 57:09.467
Persons  decided to leave the
ignored. I with the others.

57:09.468 --> 57:14.144
2007 Michael Newdow took the
of the Supreme Court in front of the story -

57:14.306 --> 57:18.277
trying to remove uskollisuuden-
whales phrase "name of God".

57:18.278 --> 57:23.439
The case was considered to be unfounded, and was not processed.

57:23.440 --> 57:30.154
The president dismissed the case due to fear of
a.

57:30.155 --> 57:33.699
Fear,
that we now have to face.

57:33.700 --> 57:37.330
Vasgloben When the news reached the President finds
-

57:37.331 --> 57:41.175
the project came a new light
and it was re-opened.

57:43.669 --> 57:48.516
And I watch function
presidential edict.

57:53.011 --> 57:58.609
I'll be back, I promise. - No
hurry. Your family needs you.

58:02.396 --> 58:07.653
This. I do not expect you to
searching him, but if you...

58:08.318 --> 58:11.404
If you happen to see
him, let me know.

58:11.405 --> 58:19.078
Click here to reach me. I want to know.
- Sure. I am looking for a night.

58:19.079 --> 58:22.925
I hope you're located,
when we find him.

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:40.619
Father, one more thing.
Guys have a party and...

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:47.286
Clean up your room. Mother
nag about it all the time for me.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:52.082
You can do it now.
- Are you kidding me?

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:55.085
Oh, my God. -
It was the last word.

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:59.307
I do not care. I'm out of here. - Robby!

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:16.756
Did you find him? - I do not.
I'm sorry, Rich.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:22.006
I should not have come back.
Your family needs you.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:24.305
Why, then, did you?

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:30.806
When did they come from? - At night.
In the morning, everything was in place.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.350
Where are the others?
- Those took them.

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:38.647
We met another group.
When I returned as a gunslinger.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:42.494
Do you know who they were?
- They talked about Vasglobesta.

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:48.872
Four hours of the time received.
Staff information, please.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:29.708
Mr. Hadley. I'm really sorry for the confusion
.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:33.786
I, Herbert Gibbons,
in this Edgar Palatier.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:38.290
I Vasgloben BAXTER program
task manager.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.918
I know who you are.

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:44.093
And we know who you are.

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:49.770
I see You've been
Vasglobella for almost 14 years.

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:53.523
We were lucky to have
about a loyal employee.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:05:02.808
What is the exact job description again?
- I am the spokesman -

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.402
Vasgloben less
Department of Rockdale.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:11.198
And you gave an interview with a local satellite channel.

01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:14.703
So you know Baxter?
- Yes.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:23.509
Good. You will be wondering why we are here
. Do you have information?

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:29.802
None. - It is associated with Baxter
very much.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:36.024
Last heat transmission refers to a strange
activity in this region.

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:42.398
You certainly know how to
interpret these images?

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:46.868
You can see these small spots in the region.

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:52.829
And the larger the red stripes.
- Yes, I see.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:59.037
The spots and stripes point
area to be every night -

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:03.167
dramatic temperature fluctuations.

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:08.015
Such temperatures have previously been considered impossible.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:10.676
The past?

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:16.223
So, until recently.
- I understand.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:19.475
Really? - After all, it makes sense.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:25.108
I would say that about all. No it is not.
Why it makes sense to you?

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:32.155
I just meant that
I understand what you are saying.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.500
So epäilimmekin.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.704
Why are you here?

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:51.423
You have experienced something incredible -

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:58.353
and that is why we want to ask you
nocturnal visually.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:10.410
Mr. Hadley. Yet
one question.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:17.618
What do you see at night?

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:23.582
Of stars.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:29.929
Excavation center
pressure suits for deployment.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:57.134
Palatier Lord, I guess you realize that it is
is too far-fetched.

01:08:57.135 --> 01:09:02.720
Doctor, all this evening
seen is very far-fetched.

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:09.269
Yes, it is. She weighed 74 pounds and
43 grams before his death.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:13.148
76 seconds later, 4 seconds after the death of
-

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:21.000
she weighed 74 pounds and 22 grams.
Exactly 21 grams less.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.743
Massaako? - 21 grams of pulp -

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:27.212
inexplicably disappears from the heart stops.

01:09:27.214 --> 01:09:32.176
The theory is that at death...
- Soul...

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:39.843
leave the body. 21 grams of pulp
leaves the body metaphysically.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.729
Wonderland.

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:54.108
Two months later

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:06.207
seems to be lucky.
- A little to the north. Soon it will be displayed.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.924
Camp? - No. This is
Rich States.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:15.335
We will stay only for a moment. - And the shit.
I put the tent up.

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:20.632
A perfect night, Grace.
- How do you know?

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:25.855
Dreamed about her again last night.
The Moon was his favorite thing.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:56.010
Rich, wait. - Grace, it's him.
I feel it.

01:10:57.628 --> 01:11:02.134
Wait one minute. - Why?
I am tired of waiting.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.229
Rich!

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:33.964
I'm sorry.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:49.314
Grace. He goes out of hand.
He ??can not stay here.

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:54.810
He will destroy the souls of the possibilities.
I do not want to be in his presence.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.939
None of us want that.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:05.118
He is a friend, which has its own
journey, but we have ours.

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.582
He should not to lead us.

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:13.208
This he must do by yourself.
Do not you see it?

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.459
I understand.

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:26.510
Therefore, her on too. You will not be
feel like dancing to the tune of others -

01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:34.560
Rich  but needs me.
- He has a wife, Grace.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:41.898
I know that. I did not go to his
marry him, I'll help only.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:47.781
Can you help? Would you have left me
unless there would be in such a hurry to help him?

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:58.629
Rich! Rich!

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.883
Rich!

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:08.861
Tell the angels, Daddy.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:15.408
It is in the archangels
that the cherubim.

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:20.711
Then there is the heaven of angels singing.

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:27.464
And of course, guardian angels.
They protect each to their own human.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:32.425
Also you have a shoulder.
- Where is that?

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:36.681
There it is, you just do not see it.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:46.815
I'll teach you a little first
technique prior to the throw.

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:52.289
Always a step back,
thread and throwing.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.663
Well.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:06.503
Pull  when the jerks and then rewind in.
Do not give up.

01:15:06.504 --> 01:15:10.505
As you continue, the fish surrenders
and you can drag it ashore.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:13.601
Anna, I'll try to! - Okay.

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:19.478
"The Greeks called their land
Hellaaksi him."

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:25.563
Now is the time to sleep, Robby.

01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:34.313
Daddy? Do you sing a lullaby yet?
- One only.

01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:08.106
Monitor indicates that this area
happens next bulge.

01:16:08.107 --> 01:16:11.905
Drilling is
start immediately if we are going to make.

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:21.001
Are you sure this works?

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:26.790
It is a deadly counter-
contact with the air.

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:32.173
If your machine gets it up before the
surface, no problems should not be.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:38.261
Right. Drill off the ground.

01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:01.751
Stop. Make the diagnosis.

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:08.667
Are you sure picker do not know about this?
It is, therefore, come to the surface?

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:13.262
Yes.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:39.285
It is very beautiful. - It's funny,
that you see it that way.

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:45.753
So is karhunpentukin until
game warden put it in the cage.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:49.708
I think you're opposed to it.

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:53.168
Why?

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:57.797
Curiosity to get you to repeat the
of Adam and Eve's sin.

01:17:57.798 --> 01:18:01.098
All information
is not intended for humans.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:05.263
Do not you understand that this is not only a scientific
try out?

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:12.569
It is life. Spirit, who has been sacrificed
and on behalf of which has been sacrificed.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:19.370
I agreed to help you, and I sold my soul to the devil
.

01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:23.659
Your time has come to pay me a ransom
.

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:37.172
Father. - Grace.

01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:44.561
Escort both
away.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:54.103
Let's start with the transfer to removable tank.
Morning till the time -

01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:56.948
before the soul disintegrates.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:02.779
Demographic Research done.
Let's start with the genetic structure of the study.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:07.116
Calculate the memory of neurological networks. The nuclease
synapses.

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:11.537
How much time? -
Two hours to dawn.

01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:14.883
Let's start with the cytoplasm
kernel distribution.

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:22.509
It can cause serious damage to the structure of the
.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:25.178
I know.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:30.395
We are already well advanced. Collected all the data.
Ready incision.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:35.029
Stop it! - Guards the scene.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:38.282
The moment Palatier. Please.

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:47.956
Have you ever loved something so
to do everything in front of it?

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:51.708
Even you died for it?

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:57.092
I've given up everything
To find my son.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:05.552
Sacrificed my whole life.
Up to my family.

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:12.475
I'm not going to let my son be lost.

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:16.312
He's...

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:20.237
my trip.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:24.991
And if you do not give him to me
-

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:34.877
I'm going to help her body
each bone and the muscle.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.099
Give him to me.

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:30.515
Robby Hadley...

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:36.642
I should have known.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:07.552
Thank you.

01:22:08.465 --> 01:22:12.760
No one is released before the
fully conscious soul.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.435
Watch out and hurry.

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:22.487
Go on, Rich. - God bless you.

01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:39.414
Gentlemen. It is mine,
White House -

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:46.669
and no doubt the whole nation in the interests of -

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:50.965
that this project will be buried immediately.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:54.135
All the information of the existence of
disposed of -

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:59.438
And all participants
swear eternal vow of silence.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:06.189
This is one of those moments when we have to accept
-

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:11.569
that there are things in the world,
that we should not intervene.

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:14.039
At least not yet.

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:21.120
These events in the light of
Vasglobe has decided to stop -

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:28.596
BAXTER program. Such progress
reduce the world too quickly.

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.017
Thank you.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:02.789
Robby. - Hey, Dad. Do not cry.

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:07.210
All is well. -
If I could just say...

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:10.846
That you love me?
I love you, Dad.

01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:15.258
You do not have to say it.
I will always be with you.

01:24:15.259 --> 01:24:19.389
I'll always be watching you.
Just look at the stars.

01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:22.441
I look.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:25.486
I have to go now.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:32.984
I know. Give the mother and Ruby
all my love.

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:36.660
I give. - Goodbye, Dad.

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.372
Goodbye, Robby.
