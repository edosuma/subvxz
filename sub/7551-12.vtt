WEBVTT

00:03.056 --> 00:04.556
[Panting]

00:09.061 --> 00:10.854
[Beeping]

00:10.874 --> 00:13.565
[Ringing]

00:15.227 --> 00:16.390
Mrs. Barclay: Yes? Who is it?

00:16.410 --> 00:18.402
Mrs. Barclay, it's Anahita Menendez.

00:18.422 --> 00:20.570
- Who?!
- Anahita from 4d.

00:20.604 --> 00:23.882
I lost my purse with my keys.
Would you please buzz me up?

00:25.442 --> 00:27.089
[Buzzer]

00:27.109 --> 00:28.411
[Screams] [Kettle whistles]

00:28.445 --> 00:30.871
Well, thank you, darling.

00:30.891 --> 00:33.937
Martha,
what do you think of Rick's P.I. venture?

00:33.957 --> 00:36.889
Well...
It's always been a big fantasy of his

00:36.909 --> 00:38.296
to be a private investigator,

00:38.316 --> 00:39.555
and he says that things are picking up

00:39.590 --> 00:41.657
and he's getting more calls
at the office every day.

00:41.692 --> 00:44.177
Yeah, from fans wanting to meet him

00:44.197 --> 00:45.661
or people with crazy theories

00:45.696 --> 00:47.329
about where he disappeared
to for two months

00:47.364 --> 00:50.399
or cases that aren't even worth
looking into, like missing cats.

00:50.433 --> 00:53.502
Oh, well, that does seem a bit beneath him.

00:53.536 --> 00:55.337
You know, he did this because he was hoping

00:55.372 --> 00:57.206
that we would be able
to work together again

00:57.240 --> 00:59.841
and he thought he might have
some interesting cases to solve.

00:59.876 --> 01:02.077
But right now, it doesn't seem
like he's getting much of either.

01:02.112 --> 01:04.813
Well, if I know my son, then, uh...

01:04.846 --> 01:07.048
[Chuckles] He may be sticking with it

01:07.082 --> 01:08.884
because he's too proud to walk away.

01:08.918 --> 01:09.885
Castle: Good morning!

01:09.919 --> 01:12.153
Well, you're in a good mood.

01:12.187 --> 01:13.822
That's because I have retooled

01:13.856 --> 01:15.857
the Richard Castle Investigations website.

01:15.892 --> 01:17.926
- Martha: Aha.
- Castle: Now the entire world

01:17.960 --> 01:20.261
can have access to my
savvy detective skills.

01:20.295 --> 01:22.897
Though I will take only
the most compelling cases

01:22.931 --> 01:25.233
rife with mystery and intrigue.

01:25.267 --> 01:26.567
Castle, the site looks amazing.

01:26.601 --> 01:28.602
My clients deserve only the best.

01:28.637 --> 01:31.105
[Cellphone vibrates] Oh, speaking
of clients, looks like I've got one.

01:31.140 --> 01:33.074
- Better get going.
- Me, too.

01:33.108 --> 01:35.176
A private investigator must
keep regular office hours.

01:35.210 --> 01:37.778
You know, my murder's
in the village right near your office.

01:37.812 --> 01:39.880
You want to walk me to work?

01:39.915 --> 01:41.782
So, busy day ahead?

01:41.816 --> 01:44.919
While I admit the public clamor
for Richard Castle Investigations

01:44.953 --> 01:46.587
has been somewhat muted,

01:46.621 --> 01:48.722
I do have a meeting with
a client this morning.

01:48.757 --> 01:51.091
Ah, on a case rife with
mystery and intrigue, I hope.

01:51.125 --> 01:52.192
Not exactly.

01:52.226 --> 01:54.294
Thought I will gain some
classic gumshoe experience.

01:54.328 --> 01:56.063
The client wants me to
do a background check

01:56.097 --> 01:57.564
on the daughter's new boyfriend.

01:57.598 --> 01:59.899
The boyfriend is 16.

01:59.934 --> 02:02.369
Look, Castle,
you've got nothing to prove here

02:02.403 --> 02:04.737
to me or to anyone else.

02:04.772 --> 02:06.239
Now, is this really what you want to do?

02:06.274 --> 02:07.807
Well, I'm just starting out.

02:07.841 --> 02:09.908
I mean,
I have to become established, right?

02:09.943 --> 02:11.945
I got to pay my dues.
What... what do you think?

02:11.979 --> 02:15.081
I think that if this is
what you really want to do,

02:15.115 --> 02:16.950
then I'm behind you all the way.

02:16.984 --> 02:18.150
Thanks.

02:18.185 --> 02:19.886
And once I do become established,

02:19.920 --> 02:22.789
much like my Nikki heat
Novels were inspired by you,

02:22.823 --> 02:25.658
my new series of P.I. novels
will be inspired by me.

02:25.693 --> 02:27.593
I'll be my own muse.

02:27.627 --> 02:30.079
- You should have stopped at "thanks."
- Hmm. Right.

02:30.597 --> 02:32.164
Oh. [Chuckles]

02:32.199 --> 02:33.332
Old habits. Sorry.

02:33.366 --> 02:35.167
Uh, have a good at work, honey. Mwah.

02:35.202 --> 02:37.403
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:37.437 --> 02:39.472
Castle trying to crash
the crime scene again?

02:39.506 --> 02:40.772
No, actually, he's got a case of his own.

02:40.807 --> 02:42.341
So, what's the word on ours?

02:42.375 --> 02:44.476
Oh, sanitation worker found our victim

02:44.510 --> 02:46.578
hidden under some trash bags up here.

02:46.613 --> 02:48.146
She's Anahita Menendez.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.148
Anahita? That's an arabic name.

02:50.182 --> 02:52.484
Yeah, her mom's Lebanese,
but she's Colombian.

02:52.518 --> 02:53.986
And you know this how?

02:54.020 --> 02:56.154
She's a famous telenovela actress.

02:56.188 --> 02:57.990
You watch telenovelas?

02:58.024 --> 03:00.358
No, no, but my tia does.

03:00.392 --> 03:02.660
She's a huge fan of Anahita's show,

03:02.694 --> 03:06.097
"Santos desesperados..."
"Desperate saints."

03:06.132 --> 03:08.133
She plays a brilliant,
young neurosurgeon...

03:08.167 --> 03:09.867
- at least that's what my ti­a says.
- Hmm.

03:09.901 --> 03:12.437
Hey, Perlmutter.
So, tell me about our victim.

03:12.471 --> 03:14.839
Detective Beckett, so pleasant to see you.

03:14.873 --> 03:17.141
- Thank you.
- And not see Castle.

03:17.175 --> 03:18.109
Uh...

03:18.143 --> 03:20.511
Uh, signs of struggle

03:20.545 --> 03:23.213
and then death came by
way of a blow to the head

03:23.248 --> 03:24.849
delivered with such savage force,

03:24.883 --> 03:27.652
it crushed the cranial vault,
killing her instantly.

03:27.686 --> 03:29.453
Esposito: This is the murder weapon.

03:29.487 --> 03:30.755
It's a length of plumber's pipe.

03:30.789 --> 03:34.191
There's a punch of scrap pieces
in that trash bin over there.

03:34.225 --> 03:36.226
Hey, our perp may have argued with her

03:36.261 --> 03:37.727
before he took that swing.

03:37.762 --> 03:39.896
Neighbors said they
overheard some loud voices

03:39.930 --> 03:42.166
coming from outside right
around the time of death...

03:42.200 --> 03:42.966
a man and a woman's.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.035
So maybe this was spontaneous...

03:45.069 --> 03:47.904
a crime of passion committed
by someone she knew.

03:47.938 --> 03:51.438
Or she might have been killed
by a psychotic plumber lying in wait.

03:52.176 --> 03:53.209
That your Castle theory?

03:53.243 --> 03:55.244
- Yeah.
- It needs work.

03:55.279 --> 03:57.547
Look, you don't go to the
movies dressed like this,

03:57.581 --> 03:59.983
so let's find out where
she came from last night.

04:00.017 --> 04:01.417
Trouble might have followed her home.

04:01.451 --> 04:02.986
I, uh, actually tracked down the studio

04:03.020 --> 04:04.253
where they film the telenovela.

04:04.288 --> 04:05.055
They may know.

04:07.437 --> 04:09.224
_

04:09.695 --> 04:12.132
_

04:12.152 --> 04:14.721
_

04:15.118 --> 04:16.755
_

04:16.978 --> 04:19.387
_

04:19.622 --> 04:22.625
_

04:22.645 --> 04:26.500
_

04:26.848 --> 04:28.796
_

04:28.816 --> 04:32.382
_

04:32.519 --> 04:35.026
_

04:35.046 --> 04:36.122
_

04:36.142 --> 04:38.286
Hey,
so I figured out who we have to talk to.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.954
His name is Francisco Herrara.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.056
He oversees the show for the network.

04:42.091 --> 04:44.226
He's... right over...

04:44.260 --> 04:45.627
there?

04:45.661 --> 04:49.197
Sofia del Cordova... a legend, a megastar.

04:49.232 --> 04:50.131
"Chiquitas,"

04:50.165 --> 04:52.634
"el fuego de la passion,"
"caminos de Amor."

04:52.668 --> 04:54.636
"Chiquitas"?
- Yeah.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.205
Her costar over there, Manuel Villalobos,

04:57.239 --> 04:58.539
he and Sofia used to be married.

04:58.573 --> 05:01.609
Now he just rides her coattails
and uses his influence over her

05:01.643 --> 05:03.277
to get his role beefed up on the show.

05:03.311 --> 05:04.833
At least that's what I've heard.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.015
Are you sure it's your ti­a who's a fan?

05:07.049 --> 05:08.683
[Cellphone vibrates] Yeah.

05:08.717 --> 05:10.151
Excuse me.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.452
Beckett.

05:11.486 --> 05:13.287
As a man of fortitude and character,

05:13.321 --> 05:15.356
I will resist the temptation to weasel in

05:15.390 --> 05:17.791
on your investigation,
but I must confess...

05:17.825 --> 05:19.493
I have major case envy.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.162
So you heard about Anahita Menendez?

05:21.196 --> 05:23.063
Yeah, I talked to a uniform at the scene.

05:23.097 --> 05:25.065
Is it true... rising young telenovela star

05:25.099 --> 05:26.667
struck down in her apartment?

05:26.701 --> 05:29.402
Why do you get all the cases
rife with mystery and intrigue?

05:29.436 --> 05:31.972
Not to mention sultry,
tempestuous men and women

05:32.006 --> 05:34.041
and over-the-top acting.

05:34.075 --> 05:35.375
It seems real to me.

05:35.409 --> 05:38.011
See? Now you're just torturing me.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.245
Oh, come on. Cheer up, Castle.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.681
You got a client of your own.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.083
Actually, client just called.

05:43.117 --> 05:44.851
The daughter and boyfriend broke up,

05:44.886 --> 05:45.885
so no more background check.

05:45.919 --> 05:48.588
Who's your prime suspect?
Let me live vicariously.

05:48.622 --> 05:50.190
You know what, Castle? I have to go.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.724
I have a witness that we have to talk to.

05:51.758 --> 05:52.892
Yeah, I got to go, too.

05:52.926 --> 05:54.661
I got a, uh, call on the other line.

05:54.695 --> 05:55.895
Bye.

05:56.961 --> 05:58.898
Come on.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.618
I'm devastated.

06:07.916 --> 06:11.343
Anahita was an amazing
person and a gifted actor...

06:11.377 --> 06:13.136
very convincing as a neurosurgeon.

06:13.156 --> 06:16.281
- Mr. Herrara, how well did you know her?
- Very well.

06:16.316 --> 06:18.350
I discovered Ana three
years ago in Colombia,

06:18.384 --> 06:20.118
and we've been together ever since.

06:20.152 --> 06:22.187
She was a rising star.

06:22.222 --> 06:23.862
We just came off her promotional tour...

06:23.882 --> 06:26.815
Barcelona, Dubai, Miami.

06:26.835 --> 06:28.565
She already had fans all over the world.

06:28.585 --> 06:31.126
We heard that she went out last night.
Do you know where?

06:31.146 --> 06:33.865
I'm afraid I don't, but Sofia might know.

06:33.899 --> 06:35.133
They were close.

06:35.167 --> 06:37.401
Did she have any relationship problems?

06:37.436 --> 06:40.739
Issues with any overzealous
fans or stalkers?

06:40.773 --> 06:42.306
No, but...

06:42.341 --> 06:44.943
there was a terrible incident

06:44.977 --> 06:47.879
with Marcus Segundo, her assistant.

06:47.913 --> 06:48.880
What happened?

06:48.914 --> 06:51.315
Ana got upset with Marcus
for interrupting her

06:51.350 --> 06:53.251
when she was memorizing her lines, and...

06:53.285 --> 06:55.085
he lost it.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.387
He attacked her.

06:56.421 --> 06:59.223
- As in hit her?
- He tried to.

06:59.258 --> 07:01.459
The crew intervened, but Ana wasn't hurt.

07:01.493 --> 07:03.427
She was shaken up, as you can imagine.

07:03.462 --> 07:05.296
She needed a few days off to recover.

07:05.330 --> 07:07.732
Of course, I fired Marcus on the spot,

07:07.766 --> 07:10.901
but he was furious and
he threatened to kill Ana

07:10.935 --> 07:12.302
if he ever saw her again.

07:12.336 --> 07:13.703
All right, we need to talk to this guy.

07:13.738 --> 07:14.729
Where can we find him?

07:14.749 --> 07:16.154
I have his contact information
in my office.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.175
I can get it for you. We'll be back.

07:18.209 --> 07:22.246
It is truly a tragedy when
death strikes one so young.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.114
Manuel,

07:24.149 --> 07:26.483
that's the same thing you said
to the parents of the child

07:26.517 --> 07:29.319
who fell down the well in episode 347.

07:29.353 --> 07:31.788
And it is as true now as it was then.

07:31.822 --> 07:33.156
[Scoffs]

07:33.190 --> 07:34.357
Go!

07:34.392 --> 07:37.594
Go.

07:37.628 --> 07:39.996
[Sniffles]
Uh...

07:40.568 --> 07:43.166
Ms. del Cordova, I'm Detective Beckett.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.967
It's such terrible news.

07:45.002 --> 07:48.037
I just saw Ana last night.

07:48.071 --> 07:49.946
Did she mention where she was headed?

07:49.966 --> 07:53.342
To the upper West Side
to an event of some kind.

07:53.376 --> 07:55.211
- She told you that?
- No.

07:55.245 --> 07:58.213
I just assumed because she
asked to borrow my purse...

07:58.247 --> 08:00.449
an Arthur Radcliffe diamond-studded clutch.

08:00.483 --> 08:02.351
Was it found on her?

08:02.385 --> 08:03.619
No.

08:03.653 --> 08:05.020
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

08:05.054 --> 08:08.023
Ana buzzed her neighbor
because she lost it.

08:08.057 --> 08:09.958
- Why?
- She lost it?

08:09.992 --> 08:12.160
That purse was on loan from a boutique.

08:12.195 --> 08:13.161
It's due back tomorrow.

08:13.196 --> 08:15.197
If I don't return it,
I will owe them a fortune.

08:15.231 --> 08:17.165
Well, Ms. del Cordova, I'm sorry.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.233
I can't help you.

08:18.267 --> 08:21.970
But, um, if I come across it,
I'll let you know.

08:23.789 --> 08:26.693
Actually, about that purse...

08:27.243 --> 08:29.811
[Noir music playing] It
was 11:00 in the morning.

08:29.846 --> 08:33.072
My phone was quieter
than a dead church mouse.

08:33.092 --> 08:36.183
My head hurt after a
night of hitting the sauce

08:36.217 --> 08:37.352
like there was no tomorrow.

08:37.385 --> 08:41.422
And for all I knew, there was no tomorrow.

08:41.457 --> 08:43.758
I was about to pour a smile into my coffee,

08:43.792 --> 08:46.394
have a little of the hair
of the dog that bit me,

08:46.428 --> 08:48.656
when she walked in. Senor Castle?

08:49.366 --> 08:51.832
I'm looking for a private investigator.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.921
S07E12
Private Eye Caramba

08:57.941 --> 09:00.790
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

09:02.736 --> 09:05.222
I was, um, just putting this away.

09:05.242 --> 09:07.287
So, I haven't met many private eyes.

09:07.307 --> 09:09.475
I haven't met many clients... yet.

09:09.510 --> 09:10.909
So far... so far today.

09:10.944 --> 09:12.811
Um, would... would you have a seat, Ms...?

09:12.846 --> 09:13.712
Del Cordova.

09:13.747 --> 09:15.547
Sofia del Cordova.

09:15.581 --> 09:20.264
Oh, as in Sofia del Cordova
who worked with the late Anahita Menendez?

09:20.284 --> 09:21.620
Sadly, yes.

09:21.655 --> 09:22.454
That is why I'm here.

09:22.488 --> 09:24.389
Detective Beckett recommended you.

09:24.423 --> 09:25.490
She did?

09:25.525 --> 09:27.225
She said you are the best.

09:27.260 --> 09:29.628
She's absolutely right
and completely unbiased.

09:29.662 --> 09:30.728
I knew she'd come around.

09:30.763 --> 09:33.665
Uh, why don't we, uh,
get right to business, shall we?

09:33.699 --> 09:36.301
Uh, just as soon as I find a pencil.

09:36.335 --> 09:38.836
Perfect timing. Okay.

09:38.871 --> 09:40.472
Let's start with Anahita Menendez.

09:40.506 --> 09:42.274
What can you tell me about her death?

09:42.308 --> 09:44.409
Just that she borrowed
my purse for the evening,

09:44.443 --> 09:47.411
then she lost the purse
and was killed outside her apartment.

09:47.445 --> 09:51.015
And did Ana have any
enemies that you knew of?

09:51.050 --> 09:53.851
I'm sorry,
but why are you asking me about Ana?

09:53.886 --> 09:56.253
Because she's the victim.

09:56.288 --> 09:58.338
No, I'm the victim.

09:58.358 --> 10:00.692
You mean emotionally speaking
because you lost your friend?

10:00.726 --> 10:03.624
- Because I lost my purse.
- Your purse?

10:03.644 --> 10:05.629
Detective Beckett is
investigating Ana's death,

10:05.664 --> 10:07.198
but the purse is still missing.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.910
I need it found.

10:09.183 --> 10:10.767
You want me to find your purse?

10:10.802 --> 10:12.803
Not just any purse, and not mine.

10:12.837 --> 10:14.838
It's an Arthur Radcliffe original clutch

10:14.872 --> 10:17.608
on loan to me and due
back tomorrow by 5:00 p.m.

10:17.642 --> 10:21.773
It cost $500,000 and looks just like this.

10:23.181 --> 10:24.881
It's worth half a million dollars?

10:24.916 --> 10:26.883
Will you find it, Mr. Castle?

10:26.918 --> 10:29.308
I don't know who else to turn to.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.990
Ryan: So,
the canvass turned up a witness

10:34.025 --> 10:36.726
who saw a man fleeing the
scene after Ana was killed.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.629
Witness is a homeless guy.
We got him with a sketch artist right now.

10:39.663 --> 10:41.797
And what does this fleeing man look like?

10:41.832 --> 10:44.031
Uh, youngish, 6', 200 pounds.

10:44.776 --> 10:48.338
Just like Marcus Segundo,
the assistant who attacked Ana.

10:48.372 --> 10:50.306
His metrocard shows

10:50.341 --> 10:52.141
that he rode in from the Bronx last night

10:52.175 --> 10:54.343
and he got off at a stop
near Ana's neighborhood.

10:54.377 --> 10:56.378
He also has priors for assault with intent.

10:56.412 --> 10:58.714
Why would Ana hire a guy like
that to be her assistant?

10:58.749 --> 11:00.482
You know, Francisco Herrara said

11:00.516 --> 11:02.517
that she had a rough upbringing, as well,

11:02.552 --> 11:04.386
and she wanted to give Marcus a chance.

11:04.420 --> 11:05.888
She trusted him.

11:05.922 --> 11:07.256
Looks like she shouldn't have.
Where is he now?

11:07.290 --> 11:08.857
Espo's bringing him in. [Telephone rings]

11:08.891 --> 11:11.393
- I'll let you take that.
- Thanks.

11:12.977 --> 11:13.828
Hello?

11:13.863 --> 11:14.730
You referred a case to me.

11:14.764 --> 11:17.065
- Oh! So you took it?
- Yeah, of course I did.

11:17.099 --> 11:18.700
That way we get to work together, sort of.

11:18.735 --> 11:20.068
Yeah, I just... I didn't know

11:20.102 --> 11:21.836
if you'd be excited by a lost purse.

11:21.871 --> 11:22.871
A purse?

11:22.905 --> 11:25.106
I'm sorry.
This is not just some ordinary purse.

11:25.141 --> 11:27.675
This is a diamondencrusted clutch.

11:27.709 --> 11:30.278
It's on par with the
priceless Maltese Falcon,

11:30.312 --> 11:31.746
and I am hot on the trail.

11:31.781 --> 11:34.883
Matter of fact, I'm about to pore over
an exhaustive list of events

11:34.917 --> 11:36.684
that Ana may have attended last night.

11:36.718 --> 11:38.552
Unless, of course,
you'd be willing to tell me

11:38.587 --> 11:40.888
where she went now that
we're on the same team.

11:40.922 --> 11:43.291
Yeah. I wish I could help you.

11:43.325 --> 11:45.426
I get it. Church and state.

11:45.460 --> 11:47.461
That, and we don't know where she went,

11:47.496 --> 11:49.430
so looks like you're gonna have to do

11:49.464 --> 11:51.231
some actual police work, you know?

11:51.266 --> 11:52.966
Hit the streets. Start canvassing.

11:53.001 --> 11:53.867
Canvassing?

11:53.902 --> 11:56.304
Oh, that thing you get Espo and Ryan to do.

11:56.338 --> 11:58.571
My suggestion is you
wear comfortable shoes.

11:58.606 --> 12:00.607
[Elevator bell dings]

12:05.157 --> 12:06.980
Castle, I got to go.

12:07.515 --> 12:09.883
Marcus, why'd you take the
train into the city last night?

12:09.918 --> 12:12.152
To hit a bar in Chelsea. What's this about?

12:12.187 --> 12:14.321
- Were you there all night?
- No.

12:14.355 --> 12:15.922
Had a few beers and left around 11:30,

12:15.956 --> 12:16.923
walked around a little.

12:16.957 --> 12:18.425
Like to Ana's apartment?

12:18.459 --> 12:20.126
What's Ana got to do with this?

12:20.160 --> 12:21.561
She's dead.

12:21.595 --> 12:23.330
What? Ana's dead?

12:23.364 --> 12:26.065
Murdered by someone who
impulsively hit her with a pipe.

12:26.099 --> 12:28.267
A witness saw a man
matching your description

12:28.302 --> 12:29.602
leaving the crime scene.

12:29.637 --> 12:30.970
Me? It wasn't me.

12:31.004 --> 12:33.005
Are you crazy? I-I would never hurt Ana.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.074
You attacked her on the set
in front of the entire crew.

12:35.108 --> 12:36.642
Yeah, but that whole thing was staged.

12:36.676 --> 12:38.208
That is hard to believe.

12:38.228 --> 12:39.846
No, I'm telling you it's true!

12:39.880 --> 12:40.980
Ana came to me.

12:41.014 --> 12:43.850
She said she needed me to
start that fight with her.

12:43.884 --> 12:44.884
She paid me $3,000

12:44.918 --> 12:46.819
because she knew that
it would cost me my job.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.020
But she promised to give me
a better one in a few weeks.

12:49.055 --> 12:50.856
Why would she pay you to attack her?

12:50.890 --> 12:53.258
She said she needed to get
away for a couple of days,

12:53.292 --> 12:55.193
but the show wouldn't
give her any time off.

12:55.228 --> 12:57.429
So she had me cause that scene.

12:57.464 --> 13:00.031
So she did all of that to skip out on work?

13:00.066 --> 13:01.467
- Why?
- I don't know.

13:01.501 --> 13:03.468
She'd gotten real secretive lately.

13:03.502 --> 13:06.824
Taking meetings
and not telling me what they were for.

13:07.271 --> 13:09.007
She was up to something.

13:09.041 --> 13:12.110
Maybe whatever it was
is what got her killed.

13:12.481 --> 13:14.712
Marcus' alibi checks out.

13:14.747 --> 13:16.882
Street cams caught him in Soho
at the time of the murder.

13:16.916 --> 13:18.350
He's not our killer.

13:18.384 --> 13:21.051
No, that would be... this guy.

13:21.086 --> 13:23.165
Sketch came in from the homeless man.

13:24.055 --> 13:25.904
Definitely not Marcus Segundo.

13:25.924 --> 13:28.860
You know, if we could figure out
where Ana went to last night,

13:28.894 --> 13:30.528
that might tell us who this guy is.

13:30.562 --> 13:32.563
Her credit card said
that she paid for a taxi.

13:32.598 --> 13:34.766
I'm still trying to run down
where it took her, though.

13:37.702 --> 13:38.668
Ronny: Uh, excuse me?

13:38.703 --> 13:40.971
Auditorium doesn't open
for another five hours.

13:41.006 --> 13:42.706
I'm not here for the opera, Ronny.

13:42.740 --> 13:45.009
Richard Castle, private investigator.

13:45.043 --> 13:46.710
Wonder if I could ask you a few questions.

13:46.744 --> 13:49.413
Oh, wow, thought you were a writer.

13:49.447 --> 13:51.581
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

13:51.616 --> 13:54.217
Just expanding my brand,
if that's all right with y...

13:54.251 --> 13:56.900
look, did you see this woman last night?

13:57.793 --> 13:58.922
Definitely.

13:58.956 --> 14:00.924
She was here for the premiere of
"Rigoletto."

14:00.958 --> 14:02.325
You're sure?

14:02.359 --> 14:03.493
This woman?

14:03.528 --> 14:05.094
Yeah, positive.

14:05.129 --> 14:06.897
I mean, come on.
You really think I'd forget her?

14:06.931 --> 14:08.347
She's smoking hot.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.033
You know what the weird thing is, though?

14:10.067 --> 14:11.901
Is that she arrived way late.

14:11.936 --> 14:14.404
Like "a few minutes before the opera ended"
late.

14:14.438 --> 14:17.840
Did you notice if she was
carrying this purse with her?

14:17.874 --> 14:19.342
Uh, yeah, I remember that, too.

14:19.376 --> 14:21.244
Could you direct me to
where she was sitting?

14:21.278 --> 14:23.046
It could be where she left the purse.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.713
Uh, she actually didn't go to her seat.

14:24.748 --> 14:26.181
She went straight to the restroom.

14:31.387 --> 14:32.788
Castle: Hello? [Knock on door]

14:32.823 --> 14:36.091
Private investigator... investigating.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.760
The ladies' room, Castle.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.128
- Did you not see the sign?
- Seriously?

14:40.163 --> 14:42.431
You knew Ana came here
and you wouldn't share?

14:42.465 --> 14:43.631
Yeah, I just found out.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.100
She got dropped off here by a cab.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.468
You?

14:46.502 --> 14:47.936
Well, only six events held last night

14:47.971 --> 14:49.804
would require a gown and evening gloves,

14:49.839 --> 14:51.073
and the opera was one.

14:51.107 --> 14:51.873
- Hi.
- Not bad.

14:51.907 --> 14:55.235
So, Pam here was just telling me
that she saw Ana last night,

14:55.255 --> 14:57.425
and she witnessed something very strange.

14:57.445 --> 14:58.646
Really?

14:58.681 --> 15:01.115
What, uh,
what was the strange thing you witnessed?

15:01.149 --> 15:03.952
Well, she came in, very pleasant, said hi.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.386
Not everyone does that.

15:05.420 --> 15:06.287
But then she went to the corner

15:06.321 --> 15:07.889
and met with this other young woman...

15:07.923 --> 15:10.091
pretty, dark hair.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.826
She looked middle eastern, maybe.

15:11.861 --> 15:14.829
I saw her give Ana a flash-drive stick.

15:14.864 --> 15:17.163
- You mean like a USB drive?
- Exactly.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.933
They didn't say a word to each other,

15:18.967 --> 15:20.935
and then Ana up and slipped
that USB thing in her purse

15:20.969 --> 15:23.771
and snuck out like she
didn't want to be seen.

15:23.806 --> 15:25.873
So, the woman that gave Ana the USB drive,

15:25.908 --> 15:27.875
did you know her or do you
know anything about her?

15:27.910 --> 15:31.212
She looked familiar,
so she may be a season ticket holder.

15:31.246 --> 15:33.380
I need a list of those names.
Is your manager in?

15:33.415 --> 15:35.490
I'll go find her for you.

15:36.396 --> 15:38.819
A clandestine meeting at the opera house.

15:38.853 --> 15:41.054
A mysterious middle eastern woman

15:41.088 --> 15:43.156
passes a flash drive to the victim

15:43.191 --> 15:45.371
hours before her death.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.662
Perhaps our telenovela actress
was actually a covert operative.

15:50.153 --> 15:51.998
She may very well be, but I don't know

15:52.033 --> 15:54.881
how that's gonna help you find her purse.

15:57.771 --> 15:59.940
And yet find it I will!

15:59.974 --> 16:01.774
[Toilet flushes]

16:01.809 --> 16:04.110
Woman: Sir, can you please leave now?

16:07.593 --> 16:09.990
Ronny, do you happen to remember

16:10.010 --> 16:12.619
where that woman went after
she left the restroom?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.058
Yes, sir.

16:14.078 --> 16:16.428
The performance ended,
and she exited the building.

16:16.448 --> 16:18.062
You saw her leave?

16:20.004 --> 16:22.438
Ah. Right.

16:24.830 --> 16:27.143
See, I was out front helping
patrons into their cars

16:27.177 --> 16:29.178
when I saw her head for a white limo.

16:29.213 --> 16:31.292
She left in a limo?
Did she have the purse with her?

16:31.312 --> 16:32.548
Yep. You know what?

16:32.582 --> 16:34.183
Smoking hot detective was really interested

16:34.218 --> 16:36.052
in the limo, too,
and I told her all this earlier.

16:36.086 --> 16:37.653
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

16:37.687 --> 16:39.422
You didn't ask.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.990
That's a valid point.

16:41.024 --> 16:42.124
All right, I'm... I'm asking now.

16:42.158 --> 16:44.359
Please tell me everything
you remember about that limo.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.662
I have a client who's counting on this.

16:47.866 --> 16:49.398
I got your text, Mr. Castle.

16:49.432 --> 16:50.900
So?

16:50.934 --> 16:53.769
Ana was picked up by a white stretch limo
when she left the opera?

16:53.803 --> 16:54.737
Where did she go then?

16:54.771 --> 16:56.871
Uh, well,
that's what I'm trying to find out.

16:56.906 --> 16:58.540
- Does that limo sound familiar to you?
- No.

16:58.574 --> 17:00.175
Ana usually ordered limos through the show,

17:00.209 --> 17:02.077
and our service only has black town cars.

17:02.111 --> 17:05.012
Okay, well, do you know anyone
who would have ordered a limo for Ana

17:05.048 --> 17:06.448
or maybe given her one for the evening?

17:06.482 --> 17:07.848
She was a celebrity.

17:07.883 --> 17:09.384
We get limos all the time.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.719
The limo could have come from anywhere.

17:11.753 --> 17:14.722
But this UBS drive... this concerns me.

17:14.757 --> 17:17.892
Why? What was on it?
What could Ana have been mixed up in?

17:17.926 --> 17:19.093
I have no idea.

17:19.127 --> 17:22.246
But if the purse was taken
because someone wanted this UBS,

17:22.266 --> 17:23.631
I will never get it back.

17:23.665 --> 17:25.633
Except Ana buzzed her neighbor

17:25.667 --> 17:27.468
and specifically told
her she lost the purse,

17:27.502 --> 17:28.569
not that it was stolen.

17:28.604 --> 17:31.439
Now, my next step is to contact
the taxi and limousine commission...

17:31.473 --> 17:32.739
locate that limo.

17:32.774 --> 17:34.141
Wherever it took Ana

17:34.176 --> 17:36.630
is probably where she lost the purse.

17:36.650 --> 17:39.012
So, this limo is your only clue?

17:39.645 --> 17:40.781
Of course not.

17:40.815 --> 17:43.050
No, I have, uh,
my best operatives in the field

17:43.085 --> 17:45.219
shaking the trees, generating leads.

17:45.253 --> 17:48.722
And, uh, I just think
that this limousine is very promising.

17:48.756 --> 17:50.624
It doesn't sound so promising to me,
Mr. Castle.

17:50.658 --> 17:53.126
And we have less than a
day before the deadline.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.293
Call me with an update by this evening.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.000
Right.

18:00.034 --> 18:01.267
Ryan: No progress on that limo

18:01.302 --> 18:03.403
or where Ana went after the opera,

18:03.437 --> 18:06.473
but we did I.D. the woman
who gave her that USB drive.

18:06.507 --> 18:08.108
Layla Nazif.

18:08.142 --> 18:10.076
Tracked her down from her
box seats at the opera.

18:10.111 --> 18:11.244
And who is she?

18:11.278 --> 18:13.946
She is daughter of Abdul Nazif,

18:13.981 --> 18:16.749
billionaire and
high-ranking Saudi official.

18:16.783 --> 18:18.084
He's in town on U.N. nusiness.

18:18.119 --> 18:22.287
So, why was Ana involved
with the daughter of a Saudi official?

18:22.322 --> 18:24.289
That's not the only person
she was involved with.

18:24.324 --> 18:25.324
I did some digging,

18:25.358 --> 18:27.259
and it turns out she went
to the Tremaine Hotel

18:27.293 --> 18:29.294
for the same two days that
she took off from work.

18:29.329 --> 18:31.097
Some of the staff saw her hanging out

18:31.131 --> 18:32.431
with this guy... Herman Eckles.

18:32.465 --> 18:33.833
The real-estate tycoon?

18:33.867 --> 18:35.501
What was she doing with him?

18:35.535 --> 18:37.669
I called his office to find out.
Got stonewalled.

18:37.703 --> 18:40.506
- Eckles' people deny he even knew Ana.
- Huh.

18:40.540 --> 18:42.841
A secret rendezvous

18:42.875 --> 18:44.343
with a shadowy real-estate magnate,

18:44.377 --> 18:47.012
a flash-drive exchange with Layla Nazif,

18:47.046 --> 18:48.713
daughter of a Saudi official.

18:48.748 --> 18:49.648
Ana was half-Lebanese.

18:49.682 --> 18:52.717
Perhaps this is some kind of espionage plot

18:52.752 --> 18:54.719
and Ana found her way wrapped
in a web of intrigue and...

18:54.754 --> 18:56.021
Bro!

18:56.055 --> 18:57.288
You're doing it again.

18:57.322 --> 18:59.357
Plus, Castle already pitched spies.

18:59.391 --> 19:00.659
Oh, well, great minds.

19:00.693 --> 19:02.127
[Cellphone vibrates]

19:02.161 --> 19:04.362
Oh, Perlmutter. He's got something for us.

19:04.396 --> 19:07.165
I'll talk to Layla Nazif.

19:07.199 --> 19:09.133
We'll go see what Perlmutter has.

19:09.168 --> 19:10.301
I'll tell you what I have...

19:10.335 --> 19:13.504
a clue that may hold the key
to who committed this murder.

19:13.539 --> 19:15.139
And that clue would be?

19:15.174 --> 19:17.175
You see, murders are not solved

19:17.209 --> 19:19.377
by positing outlandish,
fanciful theories...

19:19.411 --> 19:23.147
sad to say, a habit you seem to
be acquiring, Detective Ryan.

19:23.182 --> 19:26.884
No, crimes are solved
by applying the scientific method.

19:26.918 --> 19:28.275
So, are you gonna show us what you found,

19:28.295 --> 19:30.802
or you just gonna stand
here and talk about it?

19:31.690 --> 19:34.524
There are bruises on the victim's wrist,

19:34.559 --> 19:36.160
as if the killer seized her.

19:36.194 --> 19:38.495
Yeah, signs of a struggle.
We already know that.

19:38.529 --> 19:41.598
Ah, but what you don't know is
that the killer left a print.

19:41.632 --> 19:43.700
After painstaking examination,

19:43.734 --> 19:46.836
I recovered an intact print here.

19:51.309 --> 19:53.009
Did you run it through the system?

19:53.043 --> 19:54.211
[Scoffs]

19:54.245 --> 19:56.213
I leave that to lesser minds.

19:59.645 --> 20:02.251
Thank you for taking the time, Ms. Nazif.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.453
I see you brought your lawyer.

20:04.487 --> 20:06.589
My father insisted.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.859
So,
I need to ask you about Anahita Menendez.

20:09.893 --> 20:11.260
Simply awful.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.795
I admired her so much.

20:12.830 --> 20:14.296
What was your relationship?

20:14.331 --> 20:16.131
We were acquaintances.

20:16.165 --> 20:18.734
You see, I adore telenovelas,

20:18.768 --> 20:21.136
much to the disapproval of my father.

20:21.170 --> 20:24.072
The passion, the drama...
Ana had such talent.

20:24.107 --> 20:27.109
She and I met at social functions
from time to time.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.170
Like at the opera?

20:30.212 --> 20:31.446
The opera?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.115
Yeah, I gather that the two of you

20:33.149 --> 20:34.750
- met at the opera last night.
- I did no such thing.

20:34.784 --> 20:35.917
But we have a witness that saw you.

20:35.952 --> 20:37.794
That witness is mistaken.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.956
You gave Ana a flash drive.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.125
- What was on it?
- Your information is incorrect,

20:43.159 --> 20:45.493
and I am not obliged to speak with you,
detective.

20:45.527 --> 20:47.828
I have diplomatic immunity.

20:47.863 --> 20:50.298
This meeting is over.

20:54.370 --> 20:56.170
Esposito: So,
you think Layla's behind the killing?

20:56.204 --> 20:59.140
I don't know,
but she's clearly hiding something.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.809
Ryan, where are we on that
print that Perlmutter found?

21:01.843 --> 21:03.978
We got an I.D. off the military database,

21:04.012 --> 21:05.345
and it matches our sketch.

21:05.380 --> 21:06.947
This is our killer.

21:06.982 --> 21:08.949
Harlan Mathis.

21:08.984 --> 21:11.852
He's out of Vegas, ex-marine,
worked in private security.

21:11.887 --> 21:13.821
But now he's freelance, and word is

21:13.855 --> 21:16.456
he'll pretty much do anything
if the price is right,

21:16.491 --> 21:17.591
including wet work.

21:17.625 --> 21:20.261
Why send a hired gun like
Mathis after a telenovela star?

21:20.295 --> 21:23.196
Let's find Mathis and ask
him about Ana's murder.

21:23.230 --> 21:26.199
Put out an APB and alert
TSA and Homeland Security.

21:26.233 --> 21:27.801
If he's still in town,
a guy like this won't be easy to find.

21:27.835 --> 21:30.101
But we'll dig in.
Hopefully make some headway by the morning.

21:30.121 --> 21:32.205
Got it.

21:32.239 --> 21:34.274
[Sighs]

21:37.473 --> 21:39.012
[Knock on door]

21:39.458 --> 21:42.849
So, the lonely P.I. burning
the midnight oil, huh?

21:42.883 --> 21:46.186
Who knew finding a purse
could be this exhausting?

21:46.220 --> 21:48.532
So, did you figure out where
the white limo took Ana?

21:48.552 --> 21:50.575
I can't even figure out whose limo it was.

21:50.625 --> 21:53.859
The taxi and limo commissions
have thousands of limos registered,

21:53.893 --> 21:55.761
but they're not broken down by colors,

21:55.795 --> 21:57.028
so I'm working on plan "b."

21:57.062 --> 21:58.783
Okay, well,

21:59.018 --> 22:01.500
you ready to get out of here,
call it a night?

22:02.319 --> 22:03.101
Ooh.

22:03.136 --> 22:04.936
What's your rush, doll?

22:04.970 --> 22:07.205
Why don't you stick around a while,

22:07.240 --> 22:09.007
give those stems of yours a rest?

22:09.041 --> 22:10.108
Could I?

22:10.143 --> 22:11.176
I'm all alone,

22:11.210 --> 22:14.345
and this is my first time in the big,
scary city.

22:14.379 --> 22:16.848
Spare me the tall tale, precious.

22:16.882 --> 22:19.216
A dame like you? You got an angle.

22:19.251 --> 22:21.619
You're pretty quick for a gumshoe.

22:21.654 --> 22:23.487
Come on. Spill the story.

22:23.522 --> 22:26.124
Time is money, and I got none of either.

22:26.158 --> 22:27.625
All right, I'll give it to you straight.

22:27.660 --> 22:30.027
I'm just a girl looking
for a private dick...

22:30.061 --> 22:30.994
Whoa.

22:31.029 --> 22:33.230
Well, then, your search is over,
sweetheart.

22:33.265 --> 22:35.866
[Laughs]

22:38.936 --> 22:41.004
This here... that's the tough one.
There we go. I got it.

22:41.039 --> 22:42.973
You got it?
[Chuckles]

22:44.942 --> 22:47.177
Sofia: Mr. Castle!

22:51.827 --> 22:53.878
Ms. del Cordova...

22:53.898 --> 22:56.310
Uh, we were not expecting you.

22:56.330 --> 22:57.678
Obviously.

22:57.698 --> 22:59.866
And do you know what I was expecting?

22:59.900 --> 23:01.334
An update from you.

23:01.369 --> 23:02.235
I totally forgot.

23:02.270 --> 23:04.437
I was... I was busy working the case.

23:04.472 --> 23:06.105
You said he was the best.

23:06.140 --> 23:08.908
Maybe your rating is not so objective.

23:08.942 --> 23:10.743
You know what? I better be on my way.

23:10.778 --> 23:13.179
You two obviously have work to discuss.

23:13.213 --> 23:15.581
Let me be plain, Mr. Castle.

23:15.615 --> 23:17.784
- Have you found my purse?
- Not yet, though...

23:17.818 --> 23:19.952
And what about where the
white limousine took Ana?

23:19.987 --> 23:21.520
I am following every lead.

23:21.555 --> 23:22.855
It's only a matter of time.

23:22.890 --> 23:24.724
Which is one thing I do not have.

23:24.758 --> 23:25.958
You're fired, Mr. Castle.

23:25.993 --> 23:27.727
What? Fired?

23:27.761 --> 23:29.061
- You can't do that.
- I just did.

23:29.095 --> 23:30.595
Well, I don't accept.

23:30.615 --> 23:33.143
You do understand how firing works?

23:33.445 --> 23:35.634
Fine.
Effective immediately,

23:35.669 --> 23:37.403
I'm hiring myself to solve this case.

23:37.437 --> 23:39.205
You can't do that. I just did.

23:39.239 --> 23:41.807
I am determined to see this through.

23:41.841 --> 23:44.543
I've made it my mission to find your purse.

23:44.578 --> 23:46.812
Take a look at this.

23:46.846 --> 23:48.814
[Computer beeps]

23:48.848 --> 23:51.116
Somewhere last night, one of Anahita's fans

23:51.150 --> 23:52.818
must have seen her in that limo,

23:52.852 --> 23:54.786
so I have been going over every post,

23:54.821 --> 23:57.322
every tweet, every comment,
every photo of Ana

23:57.356 --> 23:59.825
that's hit social media
in the last 24 hours.

23:59.859 --> 24:01.926
I've set alerts on all of her fansites,

24:01.960 --> 24:03.428
and I have a photo aggregator

24:03.462 --> 24:05.796
in case any new photos get posted.
[Computer dings]

24:05.831 --> 24:07.832
As a matter of fact, that is the sound

24:07.866 --> 24:09.500
of a fresh batch of photos arriving.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.902
[Computer dings]

24:11.937 --> 24:14.272
Not so fresh. This one is from last week.

24:14.306 --> 24:15.906
All right, well... [Computer dings]

24:15.941 --> 24:17.342
There... that one's from last night.

24:17.376 --> 24:20.244
That's her leaving the
opera with the purse.

24:20.278 --> 24:21.812
[Computer dings] - There.

24:21.847 --> 24:23.981
There's Ana in the white limo.

24:24.015 --> 24:25.349
Looks like she's in a hurry.

24:25.383 --> 24:26.683
She doesn't have my purse.

24:26.718 --> 24:28.919
- Where... where is the purse?
- Okay, wait.

24:28.954 --> 24:31.822
That photo's timestamped 11:03.

24:31.857 --> 24:33.824
That's five minutes
after she left the opera.

24:33.859 --> 24:34.791
So?

24:35.435 --> 24:37.927
So,
the usher said when she went to the limo,

24:37.962 --> 24:38.962
she had her purse with her.

24:38.996 --> 24:41.798
If she's leaving the limo
five minutes later without the purse...

24:41.832 --> 24:43.967
Then she left it inside the limousine.

24:44.001 --> 24:45.101
I find that limousine,

24:45.136 --> 24:47.715
I find your purse, Ms. del Cordova.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.140
But how without the license plate?

24:50.174 --> 24:51.775
With that.

24:51.809 --> 24:53.877
That sticker has the vin.

24:53.911 --> 24:54.911
The vehicle identification number

24:54.945 --> 24:58.088
will tell us exactly who
this car is registered to.

24:58.262 --> 25:00.884
And I know just the person
to trace that for me.

25:00.918 --> 25:03.686
[Sighs] Mr. Castle, you are a genius.

25:03.720 --> 25:07.023
You are hired. Again.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

25:18.034 --> 25:20.336
Are you awake?

25:20.918 --> 25:22.407
Oh, yeah.

25:23.707 --> 25:25.573
Well, I admit, uh,

25:25.608 --> 25:28.310
Sofia barging in on us
was a little awkward.

25:28.344 --> 25:30.712
- Mm-hmm. Try mortifying.
- Yeah.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.547
I was supposed to call her with an update.

25:32.581 --> 25:34.683
I had no idea she'd drop
by to get it in person.

25:34.717 --> 25:36.484
I'm... I'm so sorry.

25:36.519 --> 25:38.486
It was actually kind of funny,
if you think about it.

25:38.521 --> 25:40.055
Yeah.

25:40.089 --> 25:41.823
So, I'm forgiven?

25:41.857 --> 25:43.090
Mm.

25:43.125 --> 25:46.328
Forgiven enough to ask for a favor?

25:46.362 --> 25:48.330
Mm. Maybe.

25:48.364 --> 25:50.715
Depending on what you're asking.

25:50.839 --> 25:53.067
How would you like

25:53.101 --> 25:56.070
to trace a vin number for me?

25:56.104 --> 25:58.403
Oh, my God. Castle!

25:58.887 --> 26:00.790
You're unbelievable.

26:00.810 --> 26:02.343
So that's a no?

26:02.377 --> 26:05.512
Ryan: So, we may have a location
on our killer, Harlan Mathis.

26:05.547 --> 26:06.780
How'd you pull that off?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.515
Well, we knew he was from out of town,

26:08.550 --> 26:10.751
so we checked motels,
hotels, short-term housing.

26:10.785 --> 26:12.753
Building manager in Harlem
recognized him from his photo.

26:12.787 --> 26:14.755
He checked in two weeks ago
under the name James Hyndman.

26:14.789 --> 26:16.122
All right, let's go. All right.

26:16.157 --> 26:17.123
NYPD!

26:17.158 --> 26:18.692
NYPD!

26:20.995 --> 26:22.529
Clear!

26:22.564 --> 26:24.197
Clear!

26:24.869 --> 26:26.694
No sign of Mathis.

26:27.569 --> 26:28.702
Hey.

26:28.737 --> 26:30.570
I think I may have an idea who hired him.

26:30.604 --> 26:31.972
Check it out.

26:32.006 --> 26:34.607
Security credentials
for the Saudi consulate.

26:34.641 --> 26:36.476
Layla and her father are Saudi nationals.

26:36.510 --> 26:38.111
That can't be a coincidence.

26:38.145 --> 26:40.813
Yeah, well,
why would they hire Mathis to kill Ana?

26:40.848 --> 26:43.475
Well, I bet this is exciting for you.

26:43.495 --> 26:45.919
Yeah, it's not every day that the DMV

26:45.953 --> 26:48.538
gets to help the NYPD
crack a homicide case.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.089
Really?

26:50.882 --> 26:52.492
Every day.

26:52.526 --> 26:55.201
Okay, well, if you just run
that vin number through your database,

26:55.221 --> 26:57.832
tell me who the limo is registered to.

26:58.861 --> 27:00.266
My name?

27:00.300 --> 27:02.468
It's...

27:02.503 --> 27:04.103
Ryan.

27:04.137 --> 27:06.671
Uh-huh. Detective Kevin Ryan.

27:06.706 --> 27:08.774
Badge number 42344.

27:08.808 --> 27:10.342
Uh-huh.

27:10.377 --> 27:13.519
And do you have an address
for the Danbridge Group?

27:15.548 --> 27:16.982
[Knock on door]

27:17.017 --> 27:18.984
[Buzzing]

27:46.309 --> 27:48.009
Yes!

27:51.756 --> 27:53.350
Okay.

27:54.085 --> 27:56.119
[Chuckles]

28:08.700 --> 28:09.967
[Sighs]

28:10.001 --> 28:11.501
It's not here.

28:11.535 --> 28:14.871
Which means either the driver found
the purse or... [Car door closes]

28:24.681 --> 28:26.715
This isn't my limo!

28:26.749 --> 28:28.422
Give me your phone.

28:33.255 --> 28:35.023
You and I are going for a ride.

28:35.057 --> 28:37.192
[Window closes]

28:40.758 --> 28:43.026
What were you doing in the limo,
Mr. Castle?

28:43.320 --> 28:46.429
Uh, this is gonna sound crazy,
but I was looking for a purse.

28:47.331 --> 28:49.235
- A purse.
- Yeah, and it wasn't there.

28:49.255 --> 28:52.650
So why don't I just apologize
for breaking into your car,

28:52.670 --> 28:55.838
and you let me go, and, well,
we'll just call it even?

28:55.872 --> 28:57.039
Whose purse is it?

28:57.073 --> 28:58.708
Um...

29:00.132 --> 29:02.626
- Whose purse?
- Anahita Menendez.

29:03.073 --> 29:04.814
- What do you know about her and me?
- Nothing.

29:04.848 --> 29:07.257
Just that she left the limo
without her purse.

29:07.277 --> 29:09.485
You're lying.
She never had a purse when she got in.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.554
Who hired you?
Who are you really investigating?

29:11.588 --> 29:13.189
- Me?
- Why would I investigate you?

29:13.223 --> 29:15.157
For the same reason the police are.

29:15.192 --> 29:16.758
Because Ana Menendez is dead.

29:16.793 --> 29:19.929
Which you clearly had nothing to do with,
so... whoa!

29:19.963 --> 29:22.231
Okay, see, now, that's...
that's not necessary.

29:22.265 --> 29:23.665
I need to know what you know.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.667
You do know everything I know.
I know nothing.

29:25.702 --> 29:26.836
Convince me.

29:26.870 --> 29:28.070
Ryan: Harlan Mathis!

29:28.104 --> 29:29.404
NYPD!

29:29.439 --> 29:31.873
Drop that knife! Now!

29:34.846 --> 29:37.092
Turn around. Show me your hands.

29:39.413 --> 29:40.449
Castle?

29:40.483 --> 29:41.916
What are you doing here?

29:41.951 --> 29:43.952
I was only trying to find Ana's purse.

29:43.986 --> 29:45.854
How was I supposed to know
that the limo she was in

29:45.888 --> 29:47.922
was being driven by the
guy that killed her?

29:47.957 --> 29:50.040
Castle, do you realize how lucky you are?

29:50.673 --> 29:51.592
Extremely lucky.

29:51.626 --> 29:54.195
- After all, I'm married to you.
- Don't even go there.

29:54.230 --> 29:57.431
What if we didn't connect Harlan Mathis
to the Danbridge Group?

29:57.466 --> 29:59.734
What if that limo didn't have lojack?

29:59.768 --> 30:01.381
We would have no way of finding you.

30:01.401 --> 30:03.070
You would if you had traced
that vin number for me.

30:03.104 --> 30:05.473
That's not the lesson to take away here.

30:05.507 --> 30:09.610
Look, from now on, I want you to tell me
where you're going and what you're doing.

30:09.644 --> 30:10.921
Uh, see, that's not fair.

30:10.941 --> 30:13.614
Neither is how we saved your bacon

30:13.648 --> 30:15.148
and got nothing to show for it.

30:15.183 --> 30:18.118
I mean, what is a rescue
from certain death worth these days?

30:18.152 --> 30:20.120
Floor seats to a few Knicks games.

30:20.154 --> 30:21.588
At the very least.

30:21.622 --> 30:24.557
Guys, rescued from certain death?

30:24.592 --> 30:26.760
Come on!
I had him right where I wanted him!

30:29.149 --> 30:30.597
Fine. Floor seats.

30:30.631 --> 30:33.066
So, we looked into the Danbridge Group.

30:33.101 --> 30:36.903
It is a front owned by a company
controlled by Abdul Nazif.

30:36.937 --> 30:37.937
The Saudi billionaire?

30:37.971 --> 30:40.139
He's behind this?
And Mathis works for him?

30:40.173 --> 30:43.943
We figure that Mathis forced
Ana into the limo at the opera,

30:43.977 --> 30:45.978
stole her purse with the USB in it.

30:46.013 --> 30:47.447
Yes, Richard.

30:47.481 --> 30:48.948
But Mathis said that she
didn't have the purse

30:48.982 --> 30:50.460
when she got into the car.

30:50.480 --> 30:52.985
I think I know what happened.

30:53.020 --> 30:54.853
As Ana was leaving the opera house,

30:54.888 --> 30:56.923
she realized she was going to be abducted.

30:56.957 --> 30:58.590
So before she got into the limo,

30:58.625 --> 31:00.659
she ditched the purse
outside the opera house,

31:00.693 --> 31:02.528
where I will find it and solve my case!

31:02.562 --> 31:04.096
See? I'm telling you where I'm going.

31:04.131 --> 31:05.031
You know where I'm going?

31:05.065 --> 31:07.133
To get a confession out of Harlan Mathis.

31:07.167 --> 31:09.334
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.202
Where you going, floor seats?

31:11.237 --> 31:13.111
Make the call.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.176
I have nothing to say to you.

31:18.210 --> 31:21.279
Then you don't grasp the situation,
Mr. Mathis.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.816
With all the charges you're facing

31:23.850 --> 31:26.484
plus Anahita Menendez,
by the time you get out of prison,

31:26.518 --> 31:28.019
you're gonna be a senior citizen.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.823
Now, you were hired to abduct her,
weren't you?

31:36.555 --> 31:38.896
Is this supposed to be
loyalty to your employer?

31:38.931 --> 31:41.365
Because they've got none towards you.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.167
I spoke to Abdul Nazif's people,

31:43.201 --> 31:45.302
and they claim to not know you.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.428
So you're all alone here.

31:47.652 --> 31:50.074
- What are you offering?
- Consideration from the D.A.

31:50.108 --> 31:53.478
if you tell me what happened with Ana.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.481
[Breathes deeply]

31:56.970 --> 31:59.649
I was hired to secure Ms. Menendez.

31:59.684 --> 32:00.851
What were you orders?

32:00.885 --> 32:03.487
To pick her up at the opera
and bring her to Mr. Nazif.

32:03.521 --> 32:04.488
For what?

32:04.522 --> 32:06.656
He wanted to speak with her.

32:06.691 --> 32:09.093
But she had refused to meet with him.

32:09.127 --> 32:11.195
I'm not clear on the specifics.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.097
What about the USB?

32:13.131 --> 32:15.565
I don't know about any USB.

32:15.600 --> 32:19.035
When she left the opera,
I escorted her to the limo.

32:19.069 --> 32:20.904
A few stoplights later,

32:20.938 --> 32:23.907
she jumped out, ran off, and I lost her.

32:23.941 --> 32:26.075
I don't know what happened
to her after that. I do.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.411
You caught up to her at her apartment,

32:28.445 --> 32:29.913
and then you murdered her.

32:29.947 --> 32:31.547
[Chuckles]

32:31.581 --> 32:32.948
That's not true.

32:32.983 --> 32:35.118
A witness saw you fleeing the crime scene.

32:35.152 --> 32:38.888
Your print is on her neck.

32:41.392 --> 32:44.060
I went to her apartment to look for her,

32:44.094 --> 32:45.528
but she was already dead.

32:45.562 --> 32:47.863
That print is me checking for a pulse.

32:47.898 --> 32:50.432
You expect me to believe
that someone else killed her?

32:50.466 --> 32:51.534
Who?

32:51.568 --> 32:53.869
How should I know?

32:53.904 --> 32:56.722
But killing her was not my assignment.

32:57.974 --> 33:00.208
Okay, Ronny,
just so we are completely clear,

33:00.243 --> 33:03.311
you remember seeing Ana
out here with the purse?

33:03.346 --> 33:04.413
Yeah, that's right.

33:04.447 --> 33:06.814
As the driver was escorting
her into the white limo.

33:06.849 --> 33:10.252
Okay, so it's possible she
handed it off to someone,

33:10.286 --> 33:12.987
stashed it in a bag,
"enemy of the state" style.

33:13.022 --> 33:14.622
Did you notice anyone near her?

33:14.657 --> 33:16.425
Uh, just the limo driver.

33:16.459 --> 33:18.060
All right, well, how far from the limo

33:18.094 --> 33:19.127
was she when you last saw her?

33:19.162 --> 33:21.996
Uh, she was like right there,
just near the curb.

33:22.031 --> 33:23.397
Perfect. Thank you, Ronny.

33:24.499 --> 33:26.100
[Scoffs]

33:26.134 --> 33:29.032
You are getting to be an expensive habit.

33:37.011 --> 33:38.612
Oh.

33:47.222 --> 33:48.989
Yes.

33:49.023 --> 33:51.258
Ronny!

33:51.293 --> 33:53.526
I might owe you a bigger tip!

33:53.561 --> 33:55.128
[Laughs]

34:10.177 --> 34:11.744
Oops.

34:24.225 --> 34:27.359
Where I come from,
it's rude to look through a lady's purse.

34:27.393 --> 34:28.793
Ms. del Cordova.

34:28.829 --> 34:30.195
You got here fast.

34:30.230 --> 34:32.130
I'm very anxious to get that clutch back,

34:32.165 --> 34:34.166
as you well know. Even if it's a knockoff?

34:34.199 --> 34:37.302
These diamonds are fake.

34:37.337 --> 34:39.371
What's really going on here?

34:39.405 --> 34:41.373
I'm sure you're mistaken.

34:41.407 --> 34:44.243
Please give me the purse and its contents.

34:44.277 --> 34:47.078
I'm afraid I can't do that.

34:47.112 --> 34:50.414
This USB drive is a part of
the murder investigation.

34:50.449 --> 34:52.882
I'm afraid I must insist, Mr. Castle.

34:52.917 --> 34:55.353
[Gun cocks]

34:57.412 --> 34:59.650
Not your purse, is it?

34:59.861 --> 35:01.958
It's not even Arthur Radcliffe's.

35:03.348 --> 35:04.884
It's Ana's.

35:05.644 --> 35:08.858
You were after the USB
drive the whole time.

35:09.522 --> 35:11.023
Why? What's on it?

35:11.058 --> 35:13.023
That is not your concern.

35:13.043 --> 35:14.393
You used me.

35:14.427 --> 35:16.374
You're a private eye.

35:16.659 --> 35:18.798
Doesn't that come with the job?

35:18.832 --> 35:21.634
You even fired me,
knowing I'd work that much harder

35:21.668 --> 35:23.168
just to find the damn thing.

35:23.202 --> 35:25.144
I could see you are like me, Mr. Castle.

35:25.164 --> 35:28.768
You hate to lose, but lose you must.

35:28.808 --> 35:30.843
The UBS, please.

35:35.882 --> 35:37.415
[Sighs]

35:37.450 --> 35:38.851
It's USB.

35:39.323 --> 35:40.686
And where I come from,

35:40.720 --> 35:43.522
it's rude to point a gun at a man.

35:44.056 --> 35:45.591
Esposito: L-look at that.

35:45.625 --> 35:48.059
I mean, her going to prison?

35:48.094 --> 35:49.561
What a tragic waste.

35:49.596 --> 35:51.605
I just wish it would
have been Harlan Mathis.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.367
Why wasn't it? What cleared him?

35:53.387 --> 35:54.565
The lojack in his limo proves

35:54.600 --> 35:56.313
that he wasn't at Ana's
when she was killed.

35:56.333 --> 35:59.787
So you're saying I solved
my case and your case

35:59.807 --> 36:01.439
and I apprehended the killer?

36:01.474 --> 36:02.307
Hmm.

36:02.341 --> 36:06.111
Yeah, you disarmed a 110-pound woman.

36:06.145 --> 36:07.945
Must have been a tense moment.

36:07.980 --> 36:09.947
You mock, but I'm telling you,

36:09.982 --> 36:11.716
my online P.I. self-defense course,

36:11.750 --> 36:13.384
much like your special forces training,

36:13.418 --> 36:14.719
had me in the zone.

36:14.753 --> 36:17.622
It was like everything
was moving in slow-motion.

36:17.656 --> 36:20.758
You do realize it was a prop gun, right?

36:21.708 --> 36:23.561
- What?
- Yeah.

36:23.595 --> 36:26.997
No bullets, plugged barrel.

36:27.430 --> 36:28.943
Harmless.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.835
But since I didn't know that at the time,

36:31.869 --> 36:33.603
my act of valor still stands.

36:33.638 --> 36:36.673
Hey, so, uh, tech went over that USB drive.

36:36.707 --> 36:38.409
Turns out it's a dongle.

36:38.443 --> 36:39.943
Oh.

36:39.977 --> 36:41.945
Together: What's a dongle?

36:41.979 --> 36:43.947
It's basically an encrypted security key.

36:43.981 --> 36:46.816
- That unlocks what?
- When tech plugged it in, it routed them

36:46.851 --> 36:49.152
to an anonymous numbered
bank account in Switzerland

36:49.186 --> 36:50.720
with a balance of $100 million.

36:51.856 --> 36:53.456
100 million bucks?

36:53.490 --> 36:55.692
I should have charged way
more to find that purse.

36:55.726 --> 36:58.261
Ms. del Cordova, where were you at 12:09

36:58.295 --> 36:59.962
the night that Ana was killed?

36:59.996 --> 37:01.797
At home in bed.

37:01.831 --> 37:03.866
- And can anyone corroborate that?
- No.

37:03.900 --> 37:07.203
So, tell me,
why was Ana in possession of a security key

37:07.237 --> 37:10.673
to a Swiss bank account
containing $100 million?

37:10.707 --> 37:12.675
[Sighs]

37:13.693 --> 37:15.811
I'm not at liberty to say.

37:15.845 --> 37:17.680
Okay, well, here's my theory.

37:17.714 --> 37:18.781
Ana was involved

37:18.815 --> 37:21.550
in some kind of a business
deal with Layla Nazif...

37:21.585 --> 37:24.853
something secret, illegal, or both.

37:24.888 --> 37:26.722
Now, you either knew about the deal

37:26.756 --> 37:28.356
or you were involved in it, too.

37:28.391 --> 37:30.893
Feel free to jump in and
correct me at any point.

37:30.927 --> 37:34.129
You went to Ana's place
to collect the money.

37:34.163 --> 37:36.898
She didn't have the security key,
so you killed her,

37:36.932 --> 37:38.967
and then you hired Castle to find it.

37:39.001 --> 37:40.735
Ana and I were business partners,

37:40.769 --> 37:42.537
but I did not kill her.

37:42.572 --> 37:43.738
She was my friend.

37:43.772 --> 37:45.907
What kind of business, Sofia?

37:45.941 --> 37:47.976
Your future's on the line here.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.047
Ana wanted to create the first

37:53.082 --> 37:55.984
Latin-American female-driven
television network.

37:56.018 --> 37:57.318
It was her dream.

37:57.352 --> 37:58.920
A television network?

37:58.954 --> 38:00.321
She came to me because she needed

38:00.355 --> 38:02.389
someone with star power
who knew the business,

38:02.424 --> 38:04.725
but we had to keep everything secret.

38:04.759 --> 38:05.759
If anyone had found out

38:05.793 --> 38:07.928
we were trying to leave
"Santos desesperados"

38:07.962 --> 38:09.696
and the very network that created us,

38:09.731 --> 38:11.698
it would endanger the deal.

38:11.733 --> 38:13.900
But the pieces were almost in place.

38:13.935 --> 38:16.437
Ana had found an investor
that she met with...

38:16.471 --> 38:18.739
a real-estate man to buy sound stages.

38:18.773 --> 38:20.741
And I take it that was Herman Eckles

38:20.775 --> 38:22.542
and the investor was...

38:22.576 --> 38:23.677
Layla Nazif?

38:23.711 --> 38:26.947
But Layla's father tried
to stop her from investing.

38:26.981 --> 38:30.283
He didn't want his name
associated with a woman's TV network.

38:30.317 --> 38:33.687
So she went behind his
back and gave Ana the USB.

38:33.721 --> 38:36.690
The next thing I know, Ana was dead.

38:36.724 --> 38:38.758
If what you're saying is true,

38:38.792 --> 38:40.960
then why did you threaten
Castle at gunpoint?

38:40.994 --> 38:42.928
Because the money has to
be in the escrow account

38:42.963 --> 38:44.864
by 5:00 p.m. today or the deal is off.

38:44.898 --> 38:45.965
Time is running out.

38:45.999 --> 38:48.434
Who else knew about Ana's
meeting at the opera house?

38:48.469 --> 38:49.435
No one.

38:49.470 --> 38:50.703
She didn't even tell
me where she was going.

38:50.737 --> 38:53.873
She just said she was meeting
Layla on the upper West Side.

38:53.907 --> 38:56.308
And where did you and Ana
have this conversation?

38:56.342 --> 38:58.878
In my trailer, where it is private.

38:58.912 --> 39:01.047
No one else was around.

39:02.530 --> 39:03.949
Hey, Beckett. Anything?

39:03.984 --> 39:06.485
Yeah,
looks like part of Sofia's story holds up.

39:06.519 --> 39:08.788
She was at home the night of the murder.

39:08.822 --> 39:10.289
- Someone saw her?
- Mm. The doorman.

39:10.323 --> 39:11.390
He said she came in at 9:30

39:11.424 --> 39:13.592
and she didn't leave her
apartment the whole night.

39:13.626 --> 39:14.959
Esposito: Yo.

39:14.994 --> 39:16.995
So, we searched Sofia's trailer on set.

39:17.029 --> 39:18.630
You'll never guess what we found.

39:19.753 --> 39:21.639
_

39:21.659 --> 39:23.849
_

39:23.869 --> 39:25.937
Detectives, what can I do for you?

39:25.971 --> 39:29.091
Well, you can explain this.

39:29.111 --> 39:31.609
It's a microphone like the ones
we use to record the actors.

39:31.643 --> 39:35.080
Beckett: Except the actors involved
didn't know that they were being recorded.

39:35.114 --> 39:36.815
That was hidden in Sofia's trailer.

39:37.344 --> 39:39.017
Reprehensible.

39:39.051 --> 39:40.819
It's probably the tabloids again.

39:40.853 --> 39:42.821
Believe me,
I will find the person who did this.

39:42.855 --> 39:44.855
Well, you won't have to look too far.

39:44.889 --> 39:45.956
Your sound man caved.

39:45.990 --> 39:48.459
He admitted that you borrowed
it from him last week.

39:48.493 --> 39:50.961
You probably suspected what
Ana and Sofia were up to,

39:50.995 --> 39:52.996
and you knew that they
talked in Sofia's trailer,

39:53.031 --> 39:54.098
so you bugged it.

39:54.132 --> 39:56.300
That's how you knew that
Ana was planning on leaving

39:56.335 --> 39:58.302
and taking your biggest star with her.

39:58.337 --> 40:00.303
I know nothing of this.

40:00.338 --> 40:02.505
These are outrageous accusations.

40:02.540 --> 40:04.341
Those two women are the
reason audiences watch.

40:04.375 --> 40:05.675
You knew that.

40:05.710 --> 40:07.377
If you let Ana go forward with her plan,

40:07.411 --> 40:08.846
where would that leave the network?

40:08.880 --> 40:09.847
Where would that leave you?

40:09.881 --> 40:12.349
Beckett: Mr. Herrara,
we circulated your photo.

40:12.383 --> 40:13.951
You were seen at the coffee shop

40:13.985 --> 40:15.685
down the street from Ana's apartment.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.687
You waited for her to come home,

40:17.722 --> 40:19.589
and when she did, you snapped, didn't you?

40:21.892 --> 40:24.026
I made Ana.

40:24.061 --> 40:26.329
Before me, she was nobody,

40:26.364 --> 40:30.032
and she was going to ruin everything.

40:30.067 --> 40:31.968
I begged her not to do it.

40:32.002 --> 40:34.170
She refused to see reason.

40:35.182 --> 40:36.973
I-I never meant to kill her.

40:37.007 --> 40:39.375
Francisco Herrara, you're under arrest

40:39.409 --> 40:42.364
for the murder of Anahita Menendez.

40:45.715 --> 40:48.550
It is terrible what Francisco did,

40:48.585 --> 40:50.753
but Ana's legacy will live on.

40:50.787 --> 40:54.355
We deposited the money in escrow
20 minutes before the deadline.

40:54.375 --> 40:56.091
So you'll still be able
to launch the network?

40:56.125 --> 40:57.993
Yes, the deal is complete.

40:58.027 --> 41:01.530
Layla and I agreed to co-run
the company in Ana's name.

41:01.564 --> 41:04.433
I am sorry I deceived you, Mr. Castle.

41:04.467 --> 41:05.901
It comes with the job.

41:05.935 --> 41:06.935
And pulled a gun on you.

41:06.969 --> 41:08.904
Which also comes with the job.

41:08.938 --> 41:10.405
Esposito: Excuse me.

41:10.439 --> 41:12.407
Um, sorry, uh, Ms. del Cordova, I'm...

41:12.441 --> 41:14.409
I'm sorry to bother, but do you think

41:14.443 --> 41:16.845
you could sign this for
my ti­a before you leave?

41:16.879 --> 41:18.346
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

41:18.380 --> 41:20.418
What is her name?

41:22.618 --> 41:23.518
Javier?

41:23.552 --> 41:26.086
Okay, it's... it's... it's for me. It's...

41:26.121 --> 41:29.223
I-I've just been such a big
fan of yours for so long.

41:29.257 --> 41:31.992
You're just so great in
"Santos desesperados"...

41:32.012 --> 41:34.133
_

41:34.153 --> 41:36.242
_

41:36.262 --> 41:38.315
_

41:38.335 --> 41:39.530
_

41:39.550 --> 41:41.205
_

41:41.225 --> 41:42.384
Uh, you know what, Castle?

41:42.404 --> 41:44.602
We should probably get out of
here before Gates sees you.

41:44.622 --> 41:46.091
- Right. Can I walk you home?
- Yeah.

41:46.111 --> 41:47.507
Who knew a missing purse

41:47.542 --> 41:49.944
would turn into a case rife
with mystery and intrigue?

41:49.978 --> 41:50.711
Thanks.

41:50.745 --> 41:52.646
Oh, all I did was refer a case.

41:52.680 --> 41:54.249
You're the one who solved it.

41:54.269 --> 41:58.251
So, how does it feel to have
your first satisfied customer?

41:58.285 --> 42:00.119
Like I want to satisfy another one.

42:00.154 --> 42:02.054
Oh, I think that can be arranged.

42:02.088 --> 42:04.824
As the sun set on the mean
streets of the naked city,

42:04.858 --> 42:07.159
I could feel my luck was about to change.

42:07.193 --> 42:09.628
Castle: The killer was caught,
my case was closed,

42:09.663 --> 42:11.964
and hanging on my arm was
the dame of my dreams.

42:11.998 --> 42:13.999
Are you gonna be doing that all night?

42:14.033 --> 42:16.015
Not if it hurts my chances.
