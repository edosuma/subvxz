WEBVTT

00:09.509 --> 00:10.427
Mr. Hiraga…

00:10.510 --> 00:14.764
If you insist on publicly leaking photos
of your wife's affair,

00:15.515 --> 00:18.977
we will take this footage and file
a formal complaint with the police.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.732
If that were to happen,
it's fair to say that

00:23.815 --> 00:27.360
it would be far more damaging to you
than it would be to the Kazama family.

00:31.030 --> 00:35.410
There's no way
she'd go through with something like that.

00:38.455 --> 00:42.542
I can't imagine anyone wants people to
see them in such a compromising position.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.920
It must've been embarrassing for her

00:48.840 --> 00:52.385
to capture evidence that proves
that her spouse doesn't love her.

00:55.972 --> 00:58.433
Please don't mistake this
for intimidation.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.603
We plan to apply for a restraining order,

01:01.686 --> 01:03.897
on the basis of DV prevention law.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.319
I hope this makes things clear for you.

01:10.361 --> 01:14.741
Your wife is serious
in her decision to divorce you.

01:17.535 --> 01:20.663
From now on,
you will need to contact me if you wish

01:20.747 --> 01:23.666
to communicate with Sakura,
as I will be representing her.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.795
If you approach her
under any circumstance,

01:26.878 --> 01:28.797
we will be forced to take
further legal action.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.051
I'm almost certain

01:33.635 --> 01:35.929
Takuya Hiraga will stop going after her.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.348
I'll review everything and move forward

01:38.431 --> 01:40.892
with processing the divorce.
Leave it to me.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.102
I understand.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.064
Masako…

01:48.358 --> 01:49.609
I really appreciate this.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.987
I'm just doing my job as a lawyer.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.117
Talk to you later.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.957
I see.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.212
Sakura…

02:10.338 --> 02:11.339
Are you okay?

02:15.260 --> 02:16.719
At the moment…

02:17.887 --> 02:19.889
I just started recording.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.894
Well, such a humble life you have here.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.064
Remember when you used to
look down onto everyday life

02:28.148 --> 02:30.150
from the top floor of a luxury high-rise?

02:32.735 --> 02:34.946
Hey, do you hear me?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.783
I had a feeling that
he might come after me again.

02:39.701 --> 02:40.869
That's why I did it.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.415
But when he did,
I couldn't find the courage.

02:48.042 --> 02:51.212
I agonized over whether it was something

02:52.130 --> 02:53.423
I should ever show to anyone.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.979
You made a very tough decision.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.110
I realized that

03:16.070 --> 03:18.031
nothing would ever change

03:18.573 --> 03:19.824
if I don't take action.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.163
You know what.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.374
I'm not the strong person

03:30.293 --> 03:32.003
that you think I am.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.635
But it made me really happy

03:39.302 --> 03:40.720
that you said that about me.

03:41.554 --> 03:45.058
You're a strong person.

03:45.141 --> 03:49.604
You're resilient
and unbelievably beautiful.

03:50.521 --> 03:51.940
I see that in you.

03:53.691 --> 03:54.567
I…

03:56.569 --> 03:59.447
I want to…

04:02.367 --> 04:03.618
become stronger.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.996
These are instructions on
how to take care of them.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.665
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on them.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.917
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.294
How great is that?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.463
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.804
I hope they'll give them lots of love.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.018
Here we go.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.563
The Art Aquarium?

05:14.772 --> 05:17.525
- They have such a thing?
- Yes.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.445
Apparently, it's very large-scale
and beautiful.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.031
Really? I'd love to go.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.575
- Right?
- Right.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.246
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

05:33.499 --> 05:34.542
You too?

05:36.502 --> 05:37.337
Yes.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.674
I've received an invitation
from another salon.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.179
Thank you for your support.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.027
Come in.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.782
- Ms. Bando, here is your mail.
- Thank you.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.372
TOKYO FAMILY COURT

06:18.711 --> 06:21.464
- Spousal mediation.
- Yes.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.634
Takuya Hiraga has requested it.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.136
I received a notice from the family court.

06:28.012 --> 06:31.557
The divorce won't be finalized
until both parties agree to it.

06:32.517 --> 06:37.021
Unfortunately, it's quite common for
a case to be brought into mediation

06:37.105 --> 06:39.273
with the intention
of drawing out the process.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.321
It means the other party is
refusing to divorce no matter what.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.782
That can't be…

06:51.661 --> 06:52.495
Sakura…

06:54.539 --> 06:56.666
We might be in it for the long haul.

06:57.625 --> 07:01.045
Are you still committed to winning
the divorce settlement?

07:06.717 --> 07:07.552
I am.

07:11.055 --> 07:14.308
I agree to move forward with mediation.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.439
We're counting on your support.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.532
I'm sorry to put all of this on you.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.160
It's okay.

07:34.662 --> 07:38.624
So… what are you going to do
about the company position?

07:39.333 --> 07:42.253
Your father asked you to return
to the company, didn't he?

07:44.755 --> 07:45.673
Yeah.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.512
I haven't had a chance to say this…

07:59.061 --> 08:03.191
- I'm sorry about before.
- What?

08:03.983 --> 08:07.361
When you said you were
quitting the company,

08:08.321 --> 08:11.240
I wasn't able to have empathy
for what you were going through.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.869
It's okay, don't worry about it anymore.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.922
To tell you the truth,
I had some expectations,

08:26.547 --> 08:28.257
when I knew I would see you again.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.552
I thought maybe we could go back
to how things were.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.097
But…

08:39.268 --> 08:40.645
I was too late.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.110
But this time…

08:49.320 --> 08:52.156
I'm going to support
whatever decision you make.

08:53.824 --> 08:54.867
So…

08:57.328 --> 08:58.746
Don't give up.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.125
Thank you.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.162
TOYODA GOLDFISH

09:48.921 --> 09:52.008
Well, I'm heading out.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.386
Okay, I'll be here waiting.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.878
Brother?

10:32.506 --> 10:33.633
I'm glad you came.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.263
What's wrong? Have a seat.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.060
I need to talk to you about your offer.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.484
I plan to marry Sakura.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.156
It may take time…

10:58.282 --> 11:01.994
But until that day, I'm going to
continue supporting her.

11:07.792 --> 11:11.170
TOKYO FAMILY COURT

11:11.796 --> 11:14.965
Are you saying that you're
going to come work for the company

11:15.049 --> 11:18.552
in order to support your future with her?

11:23.391 --> 11:26.352
Father, I have to be honest.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.146
Back then,

11:30.356 --> 11:32.983
when I quit my job
and took over the goldfish shop,

11:33.901 --> 11:35.361
I was running from something.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.908
Grandpa's goldfish shop
happened to be available,

11:41.534 --> 11:44.203
and he had taught me
all about goldfish as a kid.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.791
But since then,

11:49.917 --> 11:52.086
I've cared for the goldfish
every single day.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.381
I tended to the shop every day,

11:56.382 --> 11:58.300
and met so many customers.

11:59.385 --> 12:03.305
After a while,
I began to feel a sense of purpose.

12:03.889 --> 12:04.849
Purpose?

12:06.350 --> 12:09.061
- From tending to goldfish?
- Yes.

12:11.730 --> 12:15.276
Sounds like an excuse from a guy
who's failed at life.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.447
What is success?

12:21.365 --> 12:23.284
You get hired at a good company

12:24.034 --> 12:25.744
and earn tons of money,

12:26.328 --> 12:28.747
get promoted and gain some status.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.751
Is that all there is to it?

12:33.335 --> 12:37.047
All I know is that
I never felt purposeful.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.761
I felt suffocated
and became someone I'm not.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.514
I felt trapped.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.520
But…

12:52.646 --> 12:56.484
the goldfish were there
to help me find myself again.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.953
People might think they're just goldfish.

13:08.996 --> 13:12.166
But with my work,
I'm able to bring some comfort to people.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.128
People who are having a hard time
with work or family,

13:16.212 --> 13:18.464
people who are
trying their best every day.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.969
I'm proud of the work I do.

13:25.387 --> 13:29.350
So is that your answer?

13:32.019 --> 13:32.895
Yes.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.358
I won't be returning to the company.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.612
I'll continue working
at the goldfish shop.

13:54.875 --> 13:58.796
Do whatever you want.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.904
It's right over here.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.331
MEDIATION ROOM

14:47.803 --> 14:49.096
Are you all right?

14:53.100 --> 14:56.937
We still have time
to refuse face-to-face communication.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.445
I'm all right.

15:08.782 --> 15:09.825
Right this way.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.885
Any information spoken in this room

15:27.968 --> 15:30.471
will remain strictly confidential.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.059
We can start small
and take plenty of time to talk.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.730
I will now conclude the introduction
to the terms of mediation.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.442
Do both parties understand?

15:45.569 --> 15:46.695
Yes.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.910
Mr. Takuya Hiraga?

16:03.253 --> 16:04.296
That's not it.

16:08.717 --> 16:09.760
That video.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.515
It's not proof that I don't love you.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.352
I had mentioned that.

16:19.895 --> 16:23.107
I was saying how embarrassing it must feel
to have such proof

16:23.899 --> 16:25.901
that your spouse doesn't love you.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.280
No, that's not it.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.452
The reason I hit you

16:36.578 --> 16:39.832
and cheated repeatedly is because--

16:39.915 --> 16:40.791
Mr. Hiraga!

16:40.874 --> 16:44.878
We can hear details later. For now,
let's discuss the order of proceedings--

16:44.962 --> 16:46.422
I was scared.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.929
Sakura, I wasn't sure that

16:54.972 --> 16:57.433
you actually loved me.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.227
I felt insecure about it.

17:03.689 --> 17:07.901
I thought that you might leave me one day
and disappear forever.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.489
That made me anxious.

17:17.703 --> 17:21.623
So you tested her?

17:23.250 --> 17:28.255
You wanted to confirm that she wouldn't
leave you no matter what you did?

17:28.338 --> 17:29.423
Why?

17:31.925 --> 17:33.010
Why…

17:36.513 --> 17:38.599
There was no need for that.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.437
Everyone trusts you.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.523
They're all fond of you.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.237
You've always had innate strengths

17:53.572 --> 17:55.699
that I would never possess.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.373
That's always frustrated me.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.420
So when you became unable
to cut hair anymore…

18:11.048 --> 18:12.216
I felt relieved.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.388
You were no longer able to leave me.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.017
I thought I could control you.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.567
I know I'm selfish.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.196
I know I'm incredibly foolish.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.367
But…

18:40.536 --> 18:42.329
It's not that I didn't love you.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.545
I've always…

19:00.097 --> 19:02.015
genuinely loved you, Sakura.

19:03.809 --> 19:04.977
I wanted to say that…

19:09.273 --> 19:11.066
to you in person.

19:13.610 --> 19:14.945
The only way I could see you

19:16.071 --> 19:17.656
was through mediation.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.495
That's why I came here.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.547
I have no intention
of contesting the divorce.

19:36.592 --> 19:40.262
Does this mean you agree
to finalizing the divorce?

19:40.345 --> 19:41.889
Are you okay with that?

19:49.605 --> 19:50.606
Yes.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.828
That worked out well.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.707
You can finally take back your freedom.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.672
What's the matter?

20:22.429 --> 20:24.848
I'm a little worried.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.516
Why?

20:27.684 --> 20:29.853
Why would he suddenly say those things?

20:31.313 --> 20:32.689
I've never seen him…

20:34.942 --> 20:36.610
in that state.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.636
Welcome home.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.100
Yeah.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.186
Good morning.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.481
Sakura.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.026
Long time no see.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.153
What are you up to today?

22:44.529 --> 22:46.323
I came to gather some of my things.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.240
What?

22:48.992 --> 22:50.827
He doesn't live here anymore.

22:52.871 --> 22:56.374
Takuya has sold the place and moved out.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.795
Why?

22:59.878 --> 23:02.589
I assume he couldn't keep up with
the mortgage payments.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.716
Since the salon shuttered.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.136
The salon?

23:11.264 --> 23:13.308
You don't know anything, huh?

23:15.644 --> 23:20.107
After you left,
Takuya spiraled out of control.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.485
He didn't tend to the business at all.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.573
What's with that expression?

23:29.741 --> 23:31.660
These are the results of your actions.

23:33.787 --> 23:34.996
I just thought…

23:36.623 --> 23:38.291
I didn't need to be there.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.336
That they could easily find a replacement.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.047
So I thought…

23:46.967 --> 23:50.929
him and the shop were doing fine.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.017
I don't mean to blame you.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.564
I'm not in a position to judge you.

24:02.732 --> 24:05.610
You knew about us, didn't you?

24:09.364 --> 24:14.369
Back at your birthday party,
you swore your husband was your soulmate.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.957
I never imagined you'd be so bold either.

24:20.834 --> 24:21.918
It was unexpected.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.048
But I have a newfound respect for you.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.952
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

25:23.104 --> 25:25.232
You reap what you sow, huh?

25:29.569 --> 25:31.279
I bet you're thinking, "I told you so."

25:36.451 --> 25:38.453
Don't just stand there, say something.

25:49.673 --> 25:50.840
Get out.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.096
- But--
- Would you leave already!

25:57.806 --> 25:58.932
Hurry up.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.059
I said leave!

26:40.140 --> 26:40.974
Sakura?

26:42.392 --> 26:44.102
Are you not hungry?

26:45.645 --> 26:47.272
No, that's not the case.

26:52.527 --> 26:56.531
Haruto, can I have
some vacation time this week?

26:57.032 --> 26:57.866
What?

26:58.908 --> 27:01.244
I have some loose ends I need to tie up.

27:01.328 --> 27:04.122
Like stuff with the salon.
They're all mundane errands.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.043
Okay, I understand.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.170
Thank you.

27:18.136 --> 27:18.970
Welcome.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.389
Excuse me, I need to talk with someone
about refinancing.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.224
PLAN OF OPERATIONS

27:28.563 --> 27:31.566
Unfortunately, we're unable
to approve these loans.

27:31.649 --> 27:34.861
Please reconsider. Not even for
the whole amount. Just half?

27:35.779 --> 27:39.699
I'm sorry. I've already been accepted
at a different salon.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.493
Could you reconsider?

27:41.576 --> 27:44.829
I can guarantee the salary
we previously offered you.

27:46.289 --> 27:49.584
But, you know…

27:49.667 --> 27:52.003
Please come back.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.297
Toru, Kayo…

27:56.049 --> 27:57.300
Please lend me your hands.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.511
We no longer do business
with your company.

27:59.594 --> 28:00.595
Please don't say that.

28:00.678 --> 28:03.264
I promise we'll settle
our overdue payments.

28:03.932 --> 28:08.269
Please continue to work with us.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.363
Hello.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.283
Where's Sakura?

28:22.367 --> 28:24.077
She's out today.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.704
I see.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.456
What's up?

28:35.296 --> 28:36.881
Have you seen this?

28:37.882 --> 28:39.217
HIRAGA TOKYO SALONS REMAIN CLOSED

28:43.847 --> 28:45.181
It caught my attention.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.560
Wasn't Sakura involved
on the management side of the salon?

29:00.071 --> 29:02.991
- Stop making this your business.
- Takuya…

29:04.451 --> 29:08.246
You have nothing to do
with managing the salon anymore.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.167
I set you free, just like you wanted.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.087
Go enjoy your life at that goldfish shop.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.466
Don't say that.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.135
I can't.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.555
I don't need your pity.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.558
I don't pity you.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.144
Then what is it?

29:32.687 --> 29:33.646
It's just that…

29:36.191 --> 29:38.777
this salon is important to me, too.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.528
I have some responsibility.

29:43.490 --> 29:44.324
Plus…

29:44.866 --> 29:48.578
I don't want things to end like this.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.748
I don't want the business
to go under like this.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.462
Don't give up.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.967
Let's do this together.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.223
It's okay, don't worry.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.226
Even if you can't cut hair anymore,

30:12.644 --> 30:15.021
I still want you to be part of the salon.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.154
Let's do this together.

30:55.103 --> 30:55.937
Welcome home.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.231
I'm home.

30:59.232 --> 31:01.401
You were late. I got worried.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.113
Sorry I couldn't get in touch with you.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.030
It's okay.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.616
You must be tired.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.369
You took care of a lot. Let's have tea.

31:23.089 --> 31:25.091
- Haruto.
- Yes?

31:25.842 --> 31:29.345
Let's visit the Art Aquarium tomorrow.

31:32.348 --> 31:34.309
That sounds nice. Let's go.

31:48.823 --> 31:51.159
- What's this?
- This is unusual.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.661
- You're right.
- It's so vibrant. Beautiful.

31:54.954 --> 31:56.623
Wow.

31:56.706 --> 31:59.250
- It's like they're wearing glasses.
- That's rare.

32:04.797 --> 32:05.632
Wow.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.427
Maybe this much…

32:23.274 --> 32:24.192
One day,

32:25.318 --> 32:27.654
I'd like to go back near the sea
in Kamakura

32:27.737 --> 32:29.572
and open a much bigger shop.

32:34.410 --> 32:35.370
I see.

32:36.663 --> 32:39.791
- You made precious memories there.
- Right.

32:41.209 --> 32:45.296
If that happened, we could see
the fireworks show every year.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.096
We promised we'd go see
the fireworks again.

33:27.714 --> 33:28.715
Haruto.

33:30.633 --> 33:31.467
Yes?

33:47.442 --> 33:50.445
I heard about Takuya on the news.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.454
There must be something
you want to tell me.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.964
Please tell me whatever it is

34:11.257 --> 34:12.717
that you're thinking.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.184
I…

34:27.982 --> 34:28.900
It's okay.

34:30.943 --> 34:34.030
I'll be all right.

34:38.785 --> 34:42.705
I know that you're not the type of person

34:42.789 --> 34:45.792
that could leave him to rot

34:47.460 --> 34:49.087
while you pursue your own happiness.

34:50.421 --> 34:51.756
I fell in love with you

34:53.341 --> 34:55.259
because that's the kind of person you are.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.063
At first, I thought…

35:12.026 --> 35:14.278
that I should give you your space,

35:16.114 --> 35:19.492
until you were able to
sort out your feelings.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.496
But I knew that…

35:26.791 --> 35:29.043
that would put more pressure on you.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.390
I'm sorry…

35:44.016 --> 35:45.560
Please don't apologize.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.858
Meeting you has been

35:53.025 --> 35:54.569
one of the best things in my life.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.577
I will never forget the time…

36:14.046 --> 36:15.548
that we've spent here together.

36:37.653 --> 36:38.529
To have met you…

36:46.787 --> 36:48.456
I was so…

36:53.336 --> 36:54.712
so happy

36:57.048 --> 36:58.716
to have met you.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.328
Goodbye…

37:30.498 --> 37:31.707
Sakura.

37:41.008 --> 37:41.968
Goodbye.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.759
2 YEARS LATER

42:33.842 --> 42:35.678
What? Three months?

42:35.761 --> 42:38.472
Yep, we're finally pregnant.

42:39.348 --> 42:41.976
That's great. Congratulations.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.187
Not that I'm sure whose child it is.

42:45.771 --> 42:46.814
What?

42:47.982 --> 42:49.525
How about you? How are things?

42:51.652 --> 42:53.529
Yeah, not so bad.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.782
Thank you for this food!

43:07.084 --> 43:10.337
Noriko!

43:21.932 --> 43:23.183
Sorry.

43:26.395 --> 43:28.063
All right, should we kick up the speed?

43:28.689 --> 43:29.690
All right.

43:29.773 --> 43:30.899
And go!

43:35.487 --> 43:37.948
I get off early today, so let's eat out.

43:38.032 --> 43:40.451
- Really? Yay!
- Yay.

43:40.534 --> 43:42.578
- Have a good day.
- I'm off.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.122
- I'm off, too.
- Have a good day.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.382
Wow, again? You've got skill.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.595
- Wow.
- Look at her go.

44:01.305 --> 44:02.556
So many points.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.933
- Dinner is ready.
- Okay!

44:12.733 --> 44:14.943
NEW MESSAGE FROM MOMOKI

44:15.027 --> 44:17.196
TOMORROW, 3PM AT THE SAME SPOT.

44:21.867 --> 44:24.119
- Twin Ray?
- Exactly.

44:24.787 --> 44:27.831
When we're born, our souls split into two.

44:28.415 --> 44:31.710
The person who has
the other half of your soul,

44:32.211 --> 44:34.296
that is your soulmate.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.424
My soulmate?

44:57.528 --> 45:00.572
Mr. Hiraga, is it true
that you got divorced?

45:01.073 --> 45:02.616
I'm now a single man.

45:03.450 --> 45:04.993
I'm quite a lonely fellow,

45:05.869 --> 45:07.746
so I welcome any offers.

45:10.582 --> 45:13.127
SAKURA HAIR SALON GRAND OPENING

45:17.464 --> 45:18.632
Hi, Sakura.

45:19.383 --> 45:22.970
- I'm so happy for your new salon.
- Thank you.

45:23.470 --> 45:26.056
Ms. Yamazaki,
short hair looks so great on you.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.600
It was Kayo's recommendation.

45:29.184 --> 45:31.270
- It looks great on you.
- It really does.

45:32.396 --> 45:35.691
Ms. Yamazaki, we hope to
see you again soon.

45:35.774 --> 45:38.193
- Thank you for looking after me.
- Thank you.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.778
Thank you.

45:40.737 --> 45:43.073
- It really looks so great.
- Yeah.

45:44.032 --> 45:45.534
Did you fall in love with her?

45:46.785 --> 45:50.873
Sakura, did this goldfish come from
a studio in Kamakura?

45:50.956 --> 45:53.876
- You know them?
- It's near my hometown.

45:53.959 --> 45:56.962
- I visited them before.
- Really? Isn't it great?

45:57.045 --> 45:57.880
I agree.

45:59.006 --> 46:01.341
By the way, tomorrow
they're having a firework festival.

46:02.926 --> 46:06.388
I haven't been in a long time,
but it's really beautiful.

46:19.443 --> 46:22.404
Dad gazes at the goldfish a lot.

46:23.697 --> 46:24.573
Is that so?

46:25.616 --> 46:29.119
But who knew goldfish required
so much maintenance.

46:29.995 --> 46:32.706
If you don't do all the things,
they immediately become weak.

46:33.248 --> 46:34.958
It's like dating a high-maintenance woman.

46:36.126 --> 46:37.461
That's what makes them cute.

46:39.963 --> 46:40.839
Okay.

46:41.715 --> 46:43.800
Say hi to dad for me.

46:45.052 --> 46:46.011
Big brother.

46:47.888 --> 46:49.806
Are you going to see
the fireworks this year?

46:50.766 --> 46:53.143
- Yeah.
- I wonder how she's doing.

46:54.436 --> 46:55.270
Sakura.

47:00.567 --> 47:01.443
See you.

47:03.904 --> 47:06.365
- Have a good day.
- I'll see you.

48:44.546 --> 48:45.589
Pretty.

51:09.691 --> 51:14.696
