WEBVTT

00:05.830 --> 00:08.230
( theme music playing )

01:50.310 --> 01:53.609
Analyst:
HAVE YOU EVER TOLD HER
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL?

01:54.910 --> 01:56.502
OF COURSE NOT.

01:56.610 --> 01:58.100
WHY NOT?

01:58.210 --> 02:01.418
BECAUSE SHE'D START
SCREAMING AT ME.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.317
OR CRY.

02:03.420 --> 02:07.151
WHEN ELSE HAVE YOU CHOSEN
NOT EXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS

02:07.260 --> 02:10.457
SO THAT SOMEONE WOULDN'T
START SCREAMING AT YOU,

02:10.560 --> 02:12.755
OR CRY?

02:12.860 --> 02:15.454
YOU MEAN,
LIKE WITH MY DAD?

02:15.560 --> 02:16.993
YEAH.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.692
AND?

02:18.800 --> 02:21.496
- MY SISTER.
- MM-HMM.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.760
AND?

02:22.870 --> 02:24.735
OH, AND LEONARD.
( chuckles )

02:24.840 --> 02:26.205
SO PRETTY MUCH
EVERYONE.

02:26.310 --> 02:28.870
ANDREA,
WOULD IT BE SO BAD

02:28.980 --> 02:31.904
IF SOMEONE SCREAMED
OR CRIED?

02:32.010 --> 02:33.716
YES.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.139
- HORRIBLE.
- REALLY?

02:35.250 --> 02:39.812
WORSE THAN FEELING
"ISOLATED AND INVISIBLE,

02:39.920 --> 02:44.380
LIKE AN EMPTY GAPING HOLE
IN THE UNIVERSE"?

02:46.500 --> 02:51.460
SOMETIMES YOU TALK
ABOUT YOUR LIFE...

02:51.570 --> 02:55.165
IN A WAY THAT MAKES ME
FEEL SORT OF BAD.

02:55.270 --> 02:56.965
( chuckles )

02:57.070 --> 03:01.200
OKAY, LIKE, YOU MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY,

03:01.310 --> 03:03.107
YOUR HOUSE IS A PALACE.

03:03.210 --> 03:05.201
AND YOU WEAR
A SIZE FOUR...

03:05.310 --> 03:07.710
WHEN YOU'RE BLOATED.

03:07.820 --> 03:11.244
SO, WHEN YOU GET UPSET
BECAUSE YOU GAIN
A FEW POUNDS,

03:11.350 --> 03:14.911
OR YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT
HOW HIGH YOUR TAXES ARE

03:15.020 --> 03:19.127
WITH NO COMMT ON
HOW MUCH WORSE THOSE
SITUATIONS ARE FOR ME--

03:19.230 --> 03:21.949
- NOW, UH--
- IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE

03:22.060 --> 03:25.268
I'M NOT A REAL PERSON
TO YOU.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.203
( sighs, chuckles )
WOW.

03:34.580 --> 03:38.801
I AM-- I AM SO SORRY.

03:38.910 --> 03:41.845
I GUESS I GET WRAPPED UP
IN MY OWN DRAMA,

03:41.950 --> 03:43.747
OR SOMETHING.

03:43.850 --> 03:46.751
AND I AM SO GLAD
YOU FINALLY SAID SOMETHING.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.454
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO THINK ABOUT HOW
WHAT YOU SAY

03:52.560 --> 03:54.755
MIGHT FEEL TO ME
SOMETIMES.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.998
HUH.

04:01.770 --> 04:05.638
WHEN YOU TELL ME
THAT YOU ONLY WANT
TO HEAR GOOD NEWS...

04:05.740 --> 04:09.449
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
YOU ONLY, SORT OF...

04:09.550 --> 04:12.314
LOVE ME IF I GET ENGAGED

04:12.420 --> 04:14.843
OR PROMOTED AT WORK.

04:14.950 --> 04:17.180
AND THAT MAKES ME REALLY
NOT WANT TO CALL YOU

04:17.290 --> 04:19.246
WHEN I DON'T HAVE
GOOD NEWS,

04:19.360 --> 04:23.649
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,
MOST OF THE TIME.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.497
( sobbing )

04:33.800 --> 04:35.791
DAD?

04:35.900 --> 04:37.561
GOD, THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.501
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
HOW I FEEL.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.498
THAT I NEVER THINK
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS?

04:41.610 --> 04:44.670
I SHOWER YOU WITH GIFI'S.
I MEAN--

04:44.780 --> 04:47.374
GOD, ANDREA!
LOOK AT THIS APARTMENT!

04:47.480 --> 04:49.846
LOOK AT ALL
THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS
I'VE GIVEN YOU!

04:49.950 --> 04:53.954
THAT ANTIQUE MIRROR?
THE ITALIAN GONDOLA ASHTRAYS.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.413
THE QUEEN ANNE
BRASS ANDIRONS!

04:55.520 --> 04:57.988
HONEY, I DON'T SMOKE.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.921
I DON'T HAVE A FIREPLACE.

05:00.030 --> 05:02.396
AND I DON'T LIKE ANTIQUES.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.389
YOU LIKE ANTIQUES.
I LIKE MODERN DECOR,
WHICH YOU KNOW.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.297
YOUR MODERN STUFF
JUST ISN'T AS NICE.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.061
I LIKE IT.

05:09.170 --> 05:11.559
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I LIKE.

05:11.670 --> 05:13.831
FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL TAKE IT ALL BACK THEN.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.170
( sighs )
LEONARD!

05:16.280 --> 05:18.248
IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE THINGS.

05:18.350 --> 05:20.272
IT'S NOT EVEN
ABOUT YOUR REACTION.

05:20.380 --> 05:23.588
- IT'S ABOUT ME
BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS--
- GIVE ME THE CHAIR!

05:23.690 --> 05:25.112
- GET UP!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:25.220 --> 05:26.517
YOU HATE IT SO MUCH,
GIVE IT BACK!

05:26.620 --> 05:28.258
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
HOW I FEEL.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.487
- ( screams ) LENNY!
- (Andrea crashes )

05:32.960 --> 05:34.598
ANDREA?

05:35.360 --> 05:37.396
ANDREA?

05:48.240 --> 05:51.243
OH, JESUS!

05:51.350 --> 05:53.238
ANDREA,
DON'T DO THIS TO ME!

05:53.350 --> 05:55.079
OH, GOD.

05:55.180 --> 05:58.013
OH JESUS, NOW WHAT
AM I GONNA DO?

06:09.700 --> 06:11.918
Claire:
So how do you feel?

06:12.030 --> 06:13.930
Um...

06:16.000 --> 06:19.936
Alive, uh,
glad about that.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.372
Can you get this
to stay on?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.140
This pin is defective.
It won't prick.

06:29.250 --> 06:34.688
Looks like Nate may
have to get married
without a prick.

06:34.790 --> 06:36.985
What do you think, Ma?
You got any advice?

06:37.090 --> 06:39.183
( chuckles )
Advice?

06:39.290 --> 06:41.349
Oh, Claire,
I don't know.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.065
Don't give up--

06:44.170 --> 06:46.161
even when things get hard.

06:46.270 --> 06:48.465
And they always do
eventually.

06:48.570 --> 06:51.698
Never stop trying.

06:51.810 --> 06:54.108
Oh my God!
I nearly got killed
on the way out here.

06:54.210 --> 06:57.407
Some crazy old lapdog lady
almost ran me off the road

06:57.510 --> 06:59.273
with her Lexus SUV!

06:59.380 --> 07:01.348
Claire, where's David?
I need the rings.

07:01.450 --> 07:03.884
Claire:
Oh, um, I think
he's over there.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.550
David, we're starting!

07:06.660 --> 07:08.719
The twins need to get
the rings on the pillows.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.981
- I just don't want
them to get lost.
- Okay.

07:11.090 --> 07:14.025
Thanks.
Come on.

07:14.130 --> 07:16.564
- ( Maya crying )
- Oh yes, you can't stand

07:16.670 --> 07:19.423
being away from Mommy
for moment, can you?

07:19.540 --> 07:22.509
- How do you feel?
- Like...

07:22.610 --> 07:25.363
every moment of my life
had led up to this one.

07:25.470 --> 07:27.506
Like all of it makes sense.

07:27.610 --> 07:31.341
Like this is the destiny
that's been waiting for me.

07:31.450 --> 07:34.669
I know it's stupid
to think in terms of
"happily ever after,"

07:34.780 --> 07:38.682
but that's what
it feels like right now.
( chuckles )

07:39.760 --> 07:42.627
( "Wedding March" playing )

07:44.230 --> 07:46.289
( sighs )

07:46.390 --> 07:48.449
Okay, let's do
this thing.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.790
"LET'S DO THIS THING"?

07:50.900 --> 07:55.189
- HEY, NO ANALYZING.
- I'M NOT ANALYZING.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.860
I'M LOVING.
THANKS.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.777
UGH, COFFEE--
I CAN'T EVEN SMELL IT.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.472
SORRY.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.619
Priest:
We come together
on this beautiful day,

08:13.720 --> 08:17.827
to witness and celebrate
the union of Nate and Lisa.

08:19.660 --> 08:22.766
- Lisa: I vow to love
and nurture you...
- I'LL SKIP THE VOWS.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.759
- NO, YOU CAN WATCH THE VOWS.
- I'LL WATCH THEM LATER.

08:25.870 --> 08:28.794
HAVE YOU LEARNED ALL KINDS
OF INTERESTING THINGS?

08:28.900 --> 08:32.028
I JUST WANTED
TO SEE IT, YOU KNOW?

08:32.140 --> 08:35.303
SO THAT I DIDN'T
DO THE SAME THING
IN SOME WEIRD WAY,

08:35.410 --> 08:37.503
MAKE EVERYONE
UNCOMFORTABLE.

08:39.350 --> 08:42.012
Carol:
I was the first one
to shoot this location.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.886
We used it
in "Pack Up Your Sorrows:
The Mimi Farina Story."

08:45.990 --> 08:48.788
- Isn't it gorgeous?
- THIS IS GOING TO BE
DIFFERENT.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.881
I WANT IT
TO BE PERFECT.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.924
IT'S ALREADY PERFECT,
EVEN IF IT RAINS

08:53.030 --> 08:55.794
- AND EVERYBODY GETS SOAKED.
- THAT'S WHY I GOT THE TENT.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.061
EVEN IF THE BAND SUCKS
AND THE FOOD IS RANCID.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.832
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ONLY HAVING
HORS D'OEUVRES.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.431
I love how weddings
erase the past.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.167
Like a coat
of white primer.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.807
Slap a veil on her
and the biggest slutbag
on the planet

09:07.910 --> 09:10.105
becomes
a fresh-faced Ingenue.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.768
OH, I'M GONNA PUKE.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.145
SORRY.
IS IT THE COFFEE?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.047
( groans )

09:24.530 --> 09:26.919
( chatting )

09:31.170 --> 09:34.833
- ( Brenda retching )
- YOU OKAY, BREN?

09:42.510 --> 09:45.047
OW. GOD DAMN IT!

09:45.150 --> 09:47.141
( sighs )

09:54.290 --> 09:57.782
George's voice:
YEAH WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT SHE TOLD ME.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.996
WHO WANTED TUNA FISH?

10:01.100 --> 10:04.365
( laughs )
HOLD THE MERCURY!

10:04.470 --> 10:06.495
WELL, YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

10:06.600 --> 10:09.467
- GEORGE?
- IF YOU WANT MERCURY,
I'LL GIVE YOU MERCURY.

10:09.570 --> 10:12.539
( chuckles )
HELL, OUR BLOODSTREAM'S
ALREADY FULL OF IT.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.235
IT'S IN ALL THE WATER.
THE RIVERS ARE POISONED.
THE OCEAN'S POISONED!

10:16.340 --> 10:18.308
( laughs )

10:24.590 --> 10:26.956
- Nate: GEORGE.
- NO.

10:27.060 --> 10:27.981
(y II
NeOI)

10:28.090 --> 10:30.627
NO! NO!

10:30.730 --> 10:34.052
(crying )
NO! NO!

10:34.160 --> 10:36.890
- ( George shouting )
- ( ambulance door slams )

10:39.630 --> 10:43.839
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW
THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

10:43.940 --> 10:47.068
I MEAN, THEY HAD SUCH
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP,
I THOUGHT.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.975
THEY NEVER FOUGHT.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.211
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.948
SOME THINGS IN LIFE...

10:58.050 --> 11:01.019
WE CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND
EXACTLY WHY THEY HAPPENED.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.658
BUT IT'S SO UNFAIR.
SHE WAS JUST STARTING
TO REALLY BE HERSELF

11:04.760 --> 11:06.455
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN HER LIFE.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.790
THAT'S ROUGH--

11:08.900 --> 11:12.097
WHEN PEOPLE ARE
JUST STARTING OVER.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.259
I KNOW. I KNOW.

11:17.570 --> 11:19.561
Doctor's voice:
YOUR HUSBAND IS SUFFERING
FROM A CONDITION

11:19.670 --> 11:21.069
CALLED
"DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSIS."

11:21.180 --> 11:23.648
THE HALLUCINATIONS,
PARANOIA AND DELUSIONS

11:23.750 --> 11:25.103
ARE ALL CHARACTERISTIC.

11:25.210 --> 11:28.008
WE GENERALLY
GET GOOD RESULTS
FROM A COMBINATION

11:28.120 --> 11:30.088
OF TRICYCLIC
ANTIDEPRESSANTS

11:30.190 --> 11:33.512
- AND ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS.
- BUT HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

11:33.620 --> 11:36.214
ANY KIND OF STRESS
CAN TRIGGER THIS TYPE
OF CONDITION.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.721
A DEATH IN THE FAMILY,
PRESSURES AT WORK,

11:39.830 --> 11:42.321
MARITAL CONFLICTS.

11:42.430 --> 11:46.321
BUT HE WAS FINE
WHEN WE MET.

11:46.430 --> 11:48.295
HE WAS SO... LOVELY.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.005
IT CAN COME AND GO
THROUGHOUT ONE'S
LIFETIME.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.078
AND, ACCORDING
TO HIS DAUGHTER,

11:53.180 --> 11:55.569
YOUR HUSBAND HAS
HAD A LONG HISTORY
OF MENTAL ILLNESS.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.468
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO
IS GET HIM STARTED ON
THE MEDS RIGHT AWAY.

11:59.580 --> 12:02.469
AND WE'LL KEEP HIM HERE
FOR OBSERVATION FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS

12:02.580 --> 12:05.879
- AND SEE HOW
HE TAKES TO IT.
- ( car horn blares )

12:13.100 --> 12:14.692
I LIKED THAT GIRL JANINE.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.529
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:16.630 --> 12:18.928
- ABOUT WHAT?
- HER SISTER.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.759
SHE WAS NICE,
I THOUGHT.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.532
I GUESS SHE WAS NICE.
SHE WAS IN SHOCK,

12:23.640 --> 12:26.837
SO IT'S A LITTLE HARD
TO TELL WHAT SHE'D BE
LIKE ON A DATE,

12:26.940 --> 12:29.943
- IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
-JEEZ.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.075
WHAT'D HE DO,
STAB HER IN THE EYE?

12:32.180 --> 12:35.308
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
TO COUPLES WHO NEVER
LEARN HOW TO FIGHT.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.012
( instant messenger beeps )

12:37.120 --> 12:39.441
"RICKY, ARE YOU THERE?"

12:39.550 --> 12:41.552
- UH, RICKY?
- OH, SHIT.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.321
I GO'I'I'A DEAL
WITH THIS GIRL.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.354
- WHAT GIRL?
- JUST SOMEONE I DATED
A FEW TIMES.

12:46.460 --> 12:47.654
REALLY?

12:47.760 --> 12:50.797
YEAH, I SIGNED UP
ON match.com

12:50.900 --> 12:53.494
JUST TO, YOU KNOW,
GET OUT THERE A LITTLE.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.636
GOOD FOR YOU,
DUDE.

12:55.740 --> 12:58.504
- I GOT TO BREAK UP
WITH HER NOW.
- ON AN INSTANT MESSAGE?

12:58.610 --> 13:00.976
I DON'T WANT
TO LEAD HER ON.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.205
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:04.310 --> 13:07.416
"I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
WITH A MORE POSITIVE
ATTITUDE ABOUT LIFE."

13:07.520 --> 13:09.442
THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH,
DUDE.

13:09.550 --> 13:12.951
SHE SHOULD KNOW
FOR HER OTHER DATES.
SHE WAS A DOWNER, MAN.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.518
- THAT'S
VERY THOUGHTFUL, "RICKY."
- ( tone chimes )

13:20.700 --> 13:22.053
( sighs )

13:39.110 --> 13:40.270
Doctor:
WE'RE NOT GETTING
THE RESPONSE

13:40.380 --> 13:42.610
TO THE MEDICATIONS
I WAS HOPING FOR.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.540
GEORGE AND I HAVE
DISCUSSED IT,

13:44.650 --> 13:47.551
AND WE AGREED
OUR BEST OPTION IS
TO MOVE ON TO E.C.T.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.412
- Maggie: E.C.T.?
- Ruth: WHAT'S--?

13:49.520 --> 13:51.420
ELECT ROCONVULSIVE
TH ERAPY.

13:51.530 --> 13:52.758
SHOCK TREATMENTS?

13:52.860 --> 13:54.418
IT SOUNDS
MUCH WORSE
THAN IT IS.

13:54.530 --> 13:56.725
WE ADMINISTER
A SLIGHT SHOCK
TO THE BRAIN

13:56.830 --> 13:58.969
TO REBOOT THE CIRCUITS
AS IT WERE.

13:59.070 --> 14:00.560
BUT ISN'T THAT--?

14:00.670 --> 14:04.208
IT'S A VERY
EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR
THIS TYPE OF DEPRESSION.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.206
NOTHING ELSE
IS WORKING.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.917
( machine humming )

14:27.530 --> 14:29.225
Woman:
GEORGE?

14:32.870 --> 14:34.394
( soft sigh )

14:34.500 --> 14:36.832
- Maggie: HOW'S HE DOING?
- Ruth: MUCH BETTER.

14:36.940 --> 14:39.363
THEY THINK HE'LL ONLY NEED
A FEW MORE SESSIONS.

14:39.470 --> 14:41.973
( machine humming )

14:44.910 --> 14:47.242
TONIGHT?
BUT HE'S STILL SLEEPING.

14:47.350 --> 14:49.113
HE SHOULD WAKE UP
IN ABOUT A HALF HOUR.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.279
HE MAY HAVE SOME NAUSEA
OR MILD CONFUSION,

14:51.390 --> 14:52.982
BUT HE'LL BE FINE
TO GO HOME TONIGHT.

14:53.090 --> 14:55.183
- ARE YOU SURE?
- IT'S FINE.

14:55.290 --> 14:58.384
WORST CASE SCENARIO,
HE'LL HAVE SOME SHORT-TERM
MEMORY LOSS

14:58.490 --> 15:01.823
- BUT NOTHING TOO SEVERE.
- I THINK HE SHOULD BE OBSERVED
ONE MORE NIGHT.

15:01.930 --> 15:05.127
- IT'S NOT NECESSARY.
- I AM NOT BRINGING HIM
HOME TONIGHT!

15:08.470 --> 15:10.529
HE'S NOT READY.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.134
ALL RIGHT,
ONE NIGHT MORE.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.299
BUT TOMORROW,
HE HAS TO GO HOME.

15:17.410 --> 15:19.105
WE NEED THE BED.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.418
( sighs )

15:23.920 --> 15:26.514
FUCK, I FORGOT
TO BUY WINE.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.281
MAYBE IT'S RUDE TO BRING
WINE TO A PREGNANT HOUSE.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.324
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
PICK UP SOME ICE CREAM?

15:32.430 --> 15:34.295
NO, WE SHOULD DEFINITELY
BUY WINE,

15:34.400 --> 15:37.460
IN CASE THEY FORGOT
THAT OTHER PEOPLE STILL DRINK.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.869
CAN I WEAR THIS,
OR WILL EVERYONE THINK
I'M A TOTAL INDIGENT?

15:40.970 --> 15:42.369
( chuckles )

15:42.470 --> 15:44.802
WHAT ABOUT
THAT PURPLE THING
IN THE CLOSET?

15:44.910 --> 15:46.229
- THAT'S HERE?
- YEAH.

15:46.340 --> 15:48.479
OH, GOOD.
I TOTALLY THOUGHT
THAT WAS LOST.

15:51.180 --> 15:54.013
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST MOVE IN.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.047
REALLY?

15:59.720 --> 16:02.382
- YOU MEAN, LIKE, TOTALLY?
- WOULDN'T IT JUST BE EASIER?

16:02.490 --> 16:04.458
YOU'RE IN MY DARKROOM
ALL DAY LONG

16:04.560 --> 16:07.358
- AND YOU
SLEEP OVER EVERY NIGHT.
- IS THAT ANNOYING?

16:07.460 --> 16:09.951
YEAH, IT'S ANNOYING,
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU
TO MOVE IN,

16:10.070 --> 16:11.628
BECAUSE
I'M A TOTAL MASOCHIST.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.030
YEAH, BUT HOW WOULD
WE BOTH WORK IN HERE?

16:18.140 --> 16:19.960
IT'S BEEN FINE SO FAR.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.968
OKAY, 'CAUSE I TOTALLY
TOOK OVER YOUR SPACE.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.968
I COULD USE
MY STUDIO AT SCHOOL

16:24.080 --> 16:26.503
IF I EVER GET INSPIRED
TO MAKE ANYTHING AGAIN.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.441
OH, COME ON.

16:31.220 --> 16:34.212
IT WOULD BE A RELIEF
TO NEVER HAVE TO SEE
MY MOTHER AGAIN.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.084
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO SEE HER TONIGHT.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.321
Ruth:
WOULD YOU BE
TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED

16:41.430 --> 16:43.091
IF I COULDN'T MAKE IT
TONIGHT, DEAR?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.919
Nate:
No. Is everything
all right?

16:46.030 --> 16:48.965
I'M JUST FEELING
A LITTLE TIRED.

16:49.070 --> 16:51.265
IS GEORGE OKAY?

16:51.370 --> 16:54.203
- He's coming home
tomorrow.
- THAT'S GREAT.

16:54.310 --> 16:56.505
IS HE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT TO THE WEDDING?

16:56.610 --> 16:58.077
MAKE IT TO THE WEDDING?

16:58.180 --> 17:00.774
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT KIND OF STATE
HE'S IN?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.939
I'm sorry.
I thought he was better.

17:03.050 --> 17:04.779
HE IS BETTER.

17:04.890 --> 17:08.155
HE'S JUST
NOT HIMSELF YET.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.388
You sure you don't want
to join us?

17:11.490 --> 17:13.424
YES.

17:13.530 --> 17:16.829
I JUST NEED
ONE LAST QUIET NIGHT.

17:16.930 --> 17:20.468
I'LL BE IN BY 9:00
TOMORROW IF YOU NEED
HELP WITH ANYTHING.

17:20.570 --> 17:23.107
- ( knocks at door)
- ALL RIGHT. BYE.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.904
- HEY.
- HEY! YOU LOOK GREAT!

17:29.010 --> 17:31.103
THANK YOU.
I FEEL LIKE SHIT!

17:31.210 --> 17:32.768
- HEY. WELCOME.
- Keith: HEY.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.348
NON-ALCOHOLIC
SPARKLING CIDER.

17:35.450 --> 17:38.044
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- SO MOM'S NOT COMING.

17:38.150 --> 17:39.742
- HEY.
- WHY NOT?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.488
BECAUSE SHE HATES ME.

17:41.590 --> 17:43.285
- SHE DOESN'T
HATE YOU ANYMORE.
- NOW SHE HATES CLAIRE.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.426
- WHY DOES
SHE HATE CLAIRE?
- ( Maya giggles )

17:45.530 --> 17:48.397
MOM THINKS SHE'S
FLUSHING HER LIFE
DOWN THE TOILET.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.229
BECAUSE SHE'S TAKING
THE SEMEST OFF.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.389
NOT BECAUSE
SHE'S DATING MY BROTHER.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.196
UH, NO!
JUST THE SCHOOL THING.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.269
Brenda:
BECAUSE SHE'S TAKING OFF
ONE SEMESTER?

17:58.370 --> 18:01.077
I THINK SHE'S TERRIFIED
THAT CLAIRE WON'T GO BACK,

18:01.180 --> 18:05.048
AND MOM'S BIGGEST REGRET
IN LIFE IS THAT SHE NEVER
WENT TO COLLEGE.

18:05.150 --> 18:08.176
SO IF CLAIRE DOESN'T
GRADUATE, IT'S LIKE SHE...

18:08.280 --> 18:11.283
- FAILED TWICE
OR SOMETHING.
- MM-HM.

18:12.350 --> 18:14.682
IT'S TIME FOR SOMEBODY
TO TAKE A BATH.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.655
- Brenda: I'LL DO IT.
- Nate: YOU SURE?

18:16.760 --> 18:21.197
YEAH! I GOT TO PEE ANYWAY
FOR THE BILLIONTH TIME TODAY.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.120
WHERE DOES
IT ALL COME FROM?

18:23.230 --> 18:26.119
- Maya: BYE!
- Keith: BYE!

18:26.230 --> 18:27.538
Brenda:
WE'LL GO HAVE A BATH.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.905
- ( whispers ) SORRY.
- IT'S OKAY.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.729
SHE KNOWS WE ALL THINK
BILLY'S A BOMB WAITING
TO GO OFF.

18:33.840 --> 18:37.799
- WHAT DOES SHE THINK?
- SHE THINKS HE'S FINE WHEN
HE'S ON HIS MEDICATION

18:37.910 --> 18:40.174
AND HE'S BEEN TAKING IT
FOR A LONG TIME, SO WHATEVER.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.716
I COULD ALMOST DEAL
WITH THE GUY IF HE WASN'T
FUCKING MY LITTLE SISTER.

18:43.820 --> 18:45.481
HE'S BETTER THAN GABE.

18:45.590 --> 18:47.512
COME ON, HE WAS
A DRUG-CRAZED KILLER.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.781
HE DIDN'T KILL THE GUY,
HE SHOT AT HIM.

18:49.890 --> 18:52.654
- SHE SHOULD HAVE STAYED
WITH HER NICE GAY BOYFRIEND.
- THAT GUY WAS AN ASSHOLE.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.490
- SHE KNOWS HOW
TO PICK THEM.
- ( knocking )

18:55.600 --> 18:57.989
- David: OOH, THEY'RE HERE!
- HEY, BILLY!

18:58.100 --> 18:59.499
COME ON IN!

18:59.600 --> 19:02.990
- Keith: HOW YOU DOING, BILLY?
- GOOD.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.863
- HELLO.
- HEY.

19:04.970 --> 19:06.904
- HEY, GUYS!
- Claire: HEY.

19:09.010 --> 19:12.605
- WHERE'S MOM?
- David/Nate:
SHE'S NOT COMING.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.780
- DO YOUR PARENTS
STILL LIVE IN OHIO?
- COLUMBUS, YEAH.

19:20.890 --> 19:24.053
- WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?
- L.A., WEST ADAMS AREA,

19:24.160 --> 19:26.481
- NEAR WHERE I WORK.
- OH.

19:28.330 --> 19:30.662
I DON'T KNOW L.A.
THAT WELL.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.261
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?
- FOUR YEARS-- BUT IT'S SO BIG!

19:33.370 --> 19:35.338
MY HOURS ARE CRAZY
AT THE DENTIST,

19:35.440 --> 19:37.408
BECAUSE PEOPLE
SCHEDULE THEIR APPOINTMENTS

19:37.510 --> 19:40.377
BEFORE AND AFTER
REGULAR WORK HOURS,
AND ON WEEKENDS TOO.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.698
_ 50--
- YEAH, MY BUSINESS TOO.

19:42.810 --> 19:43.947
YOU'RE NEVER OFF.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.109
YOU COULD
ALWAYS GET A CALL.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.849
THAT MUST BE CONVENIENT
FOR DATING.

19:48.950 --> 19:51.544
- UH, WHAT?
- LIKE, WHEN YOU WANT
TO GET OUT OF A DATE,

19:51.650 --> 19:55.154
YOU CAN HAVE A FRIEND
CALL YOU AND PRETEND TO BE
A DEAD PERSON OR WHATEVER.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.182
( scoffs )
COME ON.

19:57.290 --> 19:59.588
I WOULDN'T DO THAT!

19:59.690 --> 20:02.056
Claire:
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH THE ADOPTION THING?

20:02.160 --> 20:05.698
David:
WE HAVE TWO INTERVIEWS LEFT
FOR THE HOME STUDY.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.098
Keith:
THEN WE JUST HAVE TO
WAIT FOR A REFERRAL.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.339
- Brenda:
WHAT'S AMRhl/EIFERRAL?

20:10.440 --> 20:14.376
- A KID.
- WOW. HOW LONG
WILL YOU HAVE TO WAIT?

20:14.480 --> 20:18.143
- ANYWHERE FROM
A WEEK TO MANY YEARS.
- Nate: THAT'S GOT TO BE HARD.

20:18.250 --> 20:22.778
YEAH. BUT THEY ALL SAY
SOMETIMES BEING GAY HELPS
YOU GET CHOSEN FASTER.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.314
IN THIS BACKWARD COUNTRY?

20:27.920 --> 20:31.549
- OF STRAIGHT WHITE PEOPLE.
- SO WE KIND OF POP OUT.

20:31.660 --> 20:34.049
IT'S SO WEIRD TO IMAGINE
GOING THROUGH ALL THAT--

20:34.160 --> 20:36.993
NINE MONTHS AND A DELIVERY
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
WANT THE KID.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.761
I MEAN,
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

20:38.870 --> 20:41.668
- Keith: CHRISTIANS.
- Brenda: NO, NOT ONLY.

20:41.770 --> 20:44.933
SOME WOMEN JUST CAN'T DEAL
WITH MAKING A DECISION,

20:45.040 --> 20:47.031
AND THEY LEAVE IT TOO LONG.

20:47.140 --> 20:48.676
BUT THEY DON'T EVEN
GET MONEY, RIGHT?

20:48.780 --> 20:50.133
WE'LL HAVE TO PAY
THE HOSPITAL BILLS.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.208
THAT'S WHERE
THEY CAN SCAM YOU.

20:52.310 --> 20:55.609
- IF THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND,
YOU'RE LEFT WITH THE BILL.
- THAT RARELY HAPPENS.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.609
IT REALLY MAKES YOU
SEE THE APPEAL
OF A SURROGATE.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.654
IT DOES?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.250
YEAH.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.124
THAT AND WANTING
TO HAVE YOUR OWN KID.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.427
YEAH, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY
KIDS WHO ALREADY EXIST
WHO NEED HOMES,

21:08.530 --> 21:10.327
WHY WOULD WE WANT
TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE?

21:10.430 --> 21:13.536
Keith:
FOR THE SAME REASON
STRAIGHT PEOPLE DO.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.495
BUT GIVEN
THAT IT'S NOT QUITE
AS EASY FOR US,

21:16.600 --> 21:18.636
WHY WOULD WE DO
SOMETHING SO EXTREME--?

21:18.740 --> 21:22.528
WHY SHOULD WE BE THE ONES
WHO DON'T GET TO HAVE
OUR OWN KIDS,

21:22.640 --> 21:24.904
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE GAY?

21:25.010 --> 21:28.377
IT'S NOT BECAUSE
WE'RE GAY.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.416
( scoffs )

21:31.520 --> 21:33.954
I JUST DON'T THINK A CHILD
HAS TO HAVE MY GENES

21:34.060 --> 21:35.948
FOR ME TO FEEL LIKE
IT'S MINE.

21:36.060 --> 21:39.086
I'M SURE PEOPLE LOVE
ADOPTED KIDS AS MUCH
AS THEIR OWN.

21:39.190 --> 21:40.657
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.025
MAYBE. IT'S EASY TO SAY
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.466
I LOVE MAYA.

21:47.570 --> 21:49.458
Keith:
AND YOU STILL WANTED
ONE OF YOUR OWN.

21:51.670 --> 21:55.902
YOU JUST THINK
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE HAS.

22:05.550 --> 22:08.212
WOULD ANYBODY HAVE
MORE WINE IF I OPEN
ANOTHER BOTTLE?

22:08.320 --> 22:11.448
All:
YES.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.552
You think you're
the only one with dreams
that don't work out?

22:14.660 --> 22:16.491
We both got
what we settled for.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.898
I think you just don't
love me anymore.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.265
- Louise: I do love you.
- Rico: HELLO!

22:22.370 --> 22:24.133
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

22:24.240 --> 22:27.300
YEAH, WELL, FIRST DATE,
YOU KNOW.

22:27.410 --> 22:29.071
HOW WAS IT?

22:29.180 --> 22:30.807
IT WAS OKAY.

22:30.910 --> 22:33.208
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.813
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME SAMBUCA?

22:35.920 --> 22:38.741
UM, SURE.

22:38.850 --> 22:40.386
UN LESS--

22:40.490 --> 22:43.288
- I DON'T WANT
TO DISTURB YOU.
- OH NO.

22:43.390 --> 22:45.927
I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

22:46.030 --> 22:48.658
WAS THIS THE DENTAL HYGIENIST
OR THE INVESTMENT BANKER?

22:48.760 --> 22:53.220
THE HYGIENIST.
SHARON.

22:53.330 --> 22:56.493
THE BANKER WAS
TOO... SHINY.

22:57.770 --> 22:59.533
YOU KNOW...

22:59.640 --> 23:03.030
IT MAY HAVE JUST BEEN
AN UNFORTUNATE LOTION.

23:03.140 --> 23:06.143
BUT LET'S HEAR
ABOUT SHARON.

23:10.690 --> 23:14.319
WELL, UH, SHE WAS NICE.

23:14.420 --> 23:17.628
I LIKED HER, I GUESS.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.325
DID YOU GET A SENSE
OF WHAT KIND OF PERSON
SHE WAS?

23:21.430 --> 23:23.295
DOES SHE SEEM SOLID?

23:23.400 --> 23:26.528
MM-HM.
YEAH, DEFINITELY SOLID.

23:26.630 --> 23:30.703
IT'S SO IMPORTANT--
TO FEEL YOU COULD RELY
ON SOMEONE.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.779
YEAH.
IT'S INTERESTING,
THIS WHOLE DATING THING.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.905
I NEVER REALLY DID IT
BEFORE VANESSA.

23:36.010 --> 23:37.546
ENJOY IT, DEAR.

23:37.650 --> 23:41.416
BUT TRY NOT TO BE
BLINDED BY LUST,
IF YOU CAN.

23:49.390 --> 23:53.929
HEY, DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO GET HIGH?

23:54.030 --> 23:56.157
I COULD GET HIGH.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.898
I'VE GOT SOME
REALLY GOOD POT.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.833
- I'VE GOT SOME.
- I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME
IN MY JACKET.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.589
YOU DO?

24:02.700 --> 24:05.260
IT'S LEFT OVER
FROM WHEN WE WENT
TO THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL.

24:05.370 --> 24:06.928
THAT'S TOO OLD.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.678
I JUST GOT THIS.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.374
MINE COST $200
FOR AN EIGHTH.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.711
- LET'S SMOKE THAT.
- IT'S INSIDE.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.845
DON'T TELL KEITH
WE'RE SMOKING.

24:16.950 --> 24:18.838
HE GETS REALLY ANNOYING
WHEN HE'S HIGH.

24:18.950 --> 24:21.180
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT
IN FRONT OF BRENDA.

24:21.290 --> 24:24.885
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
BILLY CAN'T SMOKE BECAUSE
OF ALL HIS MEDICATIONS.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.430
SO HOW'S MOM?

24:34.540 --> 24:37.031
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO HER?

24:39.170 --> 24:41.775
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CALL HER
TOMORROW BEFORE THE WEDDING

24:41.880 --> 24:44.804
- SO IT'S NOT TENSE.
- SHE CAN CALL ME.

24:44.910 --> 24:48.073
( exhales )

24:50.520 --> 24:52.841
THERE YOU GO.

24:54.990 --> 24:57.857
SO, UM, WHAT DO YOU GUYS
THINK ABOUT BILLY?

24:57.960 --> 25:00.485
HE'S IN A PRETTY GOOD PLACE,
YOU THINK?

25:02.400 --> 25:04.288
YEAH. DEFINITELY.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.924
GOOD PLACE,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

25:06.030 --> 25:07.998
JUST THAT HE'S DOING
REALLY WELL.

25:08.100 --> 25:10.568
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I WON'T LAY AWAKE
AT NIGHT WORRYING

25:10.670 --> 25:12.160
ABOUT THE FACT
YOU'RE IN HIS BED.

25:12.270 --> 25:15.137
THAT'S A NICE THING TO SAY
ABOUT YOUR WIFE'S BROTHER.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.128
SHE KNOWS
HOW I FEEL.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.038
( scoffs )

25:20.150 --> 25:23.517
IT IS SO UNFAIR
TO HOLD THINGS
THAT HAPPENED

25:23.620 --> 25:25.042
YEARS AGO
AGAINST SOMEONE.

25:25.150 --> 25:27.482
THAT'S SAYING THAT PEOPLE
CAN'T CHANGE!

25:27.590 --> 25:29.512
I MEAN,
YOU CHANGED!

25:29.620 --> 25:31.679
YEAH,
I'VE CHANGED,

25:31.790 --> 25:33.849
BUT I'M NOT TOTALLY
FUCKING INSANE.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.155
I DIDN'T TRY
AND CARVE A TATTOO
OFF SOMEBODY'S ASS.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.228
SHUT UP!

25:38.330 --> 25:39.695
HERE.

25:53.280 --> 25:54.816
WHAT?

25:55.720 --> 25:58.041
I DON'T KNOW.

25:58.150 --> 26:00.118
DID YOU HAVE A BAD DREAM?

26:00.860 --> 26:02.259
MAYBE.

26:03.590 --> 26:04.921
YEAH.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.692
- WHAT? WHAT?
- (groans) OH.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.569
OH MY GOD,
I'M BLEEDING.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.194
- ( shouts )
- UH, UH--

26:13.300 --> 26:15.495
- OH, NATE!
- OKAY OKAY OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.261
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

26:17.370 --> 26:20.498
I'M GOING TO TRY
TO SCHEDULE THE D&C
FOR TOMORROW MORNING.

26:20.610 --> 26:22.737
WE CAN'T DO IT TOMORROW.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.569
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.944
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

26:29.050 --> 26:30.711
THANK YOU.

26:32.950 --> 26:35.748
- BREN, WE CAN CANCEL.
- NO, WE HAVE TO DO IT
TODAY.

26:35.860 --> 26:39.318
I CAN'T GET
AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST
TODAY.

26:41.830 --> 26:44.196
WE HAVE TO DO IT
TOMORROW, BREN.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.994
( sighs )
OH, FUCK.

26:50.340 --> 26:52.262
CAN IT WAIT TILL MONDAY?

26:52.370 --> 26:54.429
SURE, MONDAY'S FINE.

26:54.540 --> 26:57.373
THEN WE'LL DO IT MONDAY.

27:05.590 --> 27:12.450
* LOVER'S FACE,
I CAN'T REMEMBER... *

27:12.560 --> 27:14.596
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

27:14.700 --> 27:16.258
GOOD.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.229
IS THAT ME?

27:19.330 --> 27:21.264
NO, IT'S NATE.

27:21.370 --> 27:22.962
NO, THESE PIECES?

27:23.070 --> 27:25.561
THAT'S BRENDA.
NARCISSIST.

27:25.670 --> 27:27.979
WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE ME.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.140
WELL, THEY'RE NOT.
THIS IS A WEDDING PRESENT.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.002
WHY WOULD I HAVE YOU
IN THERE?

27:33.110 --> 27:35.613
BECAUSE SHE CAN MARRY NATE,
BUT SHE'LL ALWAYS LOVE ME.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.041
SHE IS ME!

27:40.960 --> 27:43.212
NO!
( screams )

27:43.320 --> 27:45.754
- ( gasps )
- HEY.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.894
ARE YOU UPSET
WITH ME?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.195
NO, I WAS
JUST CONCENTRATING.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.791
ALL RIGHT.

27:54.900 --> 27:57.039
I'LL LEAVE YOU
ALONE.

28:13.550 --> 28:15.256
I'M SORRY.

28:16.490 --> 28:19.254
HOW DO I GET TO MY ROOM?

28:19.360 --> 28:21.191
YOU MEAN OUR ROOM?

28:21.300 --> 28:23.120
OUR BEDROOM?

28:25.530 --> 28:27.862
IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

28:27.970 --> 28:31.633
COME ON
UPSTAIRS NOW.

28:31.740 --> 28:34.004
WE'LL GET YOU
UNPACKED.

28:46.590 --> 28:49.980
David:
YOU MADE IT CLEAR WE'RE ONLY
CONSIDERING A SURROGATE?

28:50.090 --> 28:51.785
YEAH.
NOW WHAT ABOUT TAMARA?

28:51.890 --> 28:54.950
SHE'S GOT
YOUR FOREHEAD,
AN I.Q. OF 120.

28:55.060 --> 28:58.291
SHE'S 5'2" AND SHE
WEIGHS 160 LBS.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.891
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
SHE COSTS LESS THAN
THE OTHER ONES.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.059
IT'S NOT LIKE
I WOULDN'T LOVE
AN OBESE CHILD,

29:03.170 --> 29:05.832
BUT I'D RATHER NOT
SIGN UP FOR A LIFETIME
OF BODY ISSUES,

29:05.940 --> 29:07.805
ESPECIALLY IF WE
GET A GIRL.

29:07.910 --> 29:10.071
IF WE GET A GIRL,
YOU BETTER HOPE
SHE'S OBESE.

29:10.180 --> 29:12.273
I'M NOT HAVING SOME
12-YEAR-OLD HOTTIE

29:12.380 --> 29:15.508
RUNNING AROUND
SUNSET BOULEVARD WITH
HER ASS CRACK SHOWING.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.474
( cell phone ringing )

29:20.350 --> 29:23.012
HEY, ROG, WHAT'S UP?

29:24.760 --> 29:27.058
UH... YEAH.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.424
I CAN DO
A COUPLE OF NIGHTS
NEXT WEEK.

29:29.530 --> 29:32.067
LET ME
GET MY CALENDAR.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.035
WHAT NIGHTS WERE YOU
THINKING OF?

29:34.140 --> 29:37.598
I KNOW
I'M FREE TUESDAY.

29:37.700 --> 29:40.806
( game show music playing )

29:40.910 --> 29:42.935
ARE YOU READY TO MEET
THE BACHELORETTES?

29:44.650 --> 29:47.073
UH, I GUESS SO.

29:47.180 --> 29:49.239
LADIES.

29:49.980 --> 29:52.414
HI. I'M SIERRA.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.886
I'M 20.

29:54.990 --> 29:58.221
I HAVE A COMBINED
S.A.T. SCORE OF 675.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.480
AND I WANT TO BE
YOUR EGG DONOR-SURROGATE

30:00.590 --> 30:03.593
BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH
I'M NOT READY TO START
A FAMILY OF MY OWN,

30:03.700 --> 30:08.763
I WANT TO PUT
AS MANY VERSIONS OF MYSELF
ON THE PLANET AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

30:08.870 --> 30:12.636
HI! I'M DEE DEE
FROM SAN PEDRO.

30:12.740 --> 30:14.207
I'M 27 YEARS OLD.

30:14.310 --> 30:17.199
I LOVE OUTDOOR SPORTS,
AND I'M YOUR DREAM SURROGATE

30:17.310 --> 30:19.346
BECAUSE I'VE GIVEN BIRTH
TO NINE HEALTHY BABIES.

30:19.450 --> 30:21.543
AND IT'S MY PERSONAL MISSION
TO HAVE CHILDREN

30:21.650 --> 30:25.040
FOR BOURGEOIS NARCISSISTS
WHO CAN'T CONCEIVE
ON THEIR OWN.

30:25.150 --> 30:27.186
HI.

30:27.290 --> 30:28.552
I'M LINDSAY.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.254
I'VE GOT A DEGREE
IN APPLIED SCIENCE
FROM YALE,

30:31.360 --> 30:35.194
A MASTERS FROM M.I.T.
AND $60,000 OF SCHOOL LOANS
TO REPAY.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.552
I'M HOPING YOU PICK ME
SO I WON'T HAVE TO RESORT

30:37.660 --> 30:40.766
TO MORE OBVIOUS FORMS
OF PROSTITUTION TO GET
OUT OF DEBT.

30:40.870 --> 30:43.338
Keith:
SO, HAVE YOU FOUND HER?

30:43.440 --> 30:48.309
( sighs )
I CAN'T DO THIS, KEITH.
I'M SORRY.

30:48.410 --> 30:51.379
I CAN'T JUST RENT OUT
SOME WOMAN'S UTERUS LIKE
IT'S A STORAGE LOCKER.

30:54.850 --> 30:56.078
OKAY.

31:00.550 --> 31:01.881
Vanessa:
HI, GUYS!

31:01.990 --> 31:03.924
Julio:
DADDY GOT US
A GAMECUBE!

31:04.030 --> 31:06.089
- YOU COULD SAY HELLO!
- Julio: HI.

31:06.190 --> 31:08.055
SHARE WITH YOUR BROTHER,
JULIO!

31:08.160 --> 31:10.094
YOU'RE SPOILING THEM.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.668
CAN YOU TAKE THEM TOMORROW
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS?

31:12.770 --> 31:14.533
I CAN'T.
IT'S NATE'S WEDDING.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.665
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I FORGOT.

31:16.770 --> 31:18.863
WHO ARE YOU BRINGING?

31:18.970 --> 31:22.030
NO ONE.
YOU WANT TO COME?

31:22.140 --> 31:23.801
NO, THANK YOU.
I'M HAPPY FOR NATE,

31:23.910 --> 31:25.946
BUT I HAVE A WEEK
OF ERRANDS TO DO.

31:28.450 --> 31:30.714
- YOU SHOULD BRING
A REAL DATE.
- TO A WEDDING?

31:30.820 --> 31:35.211
- ISN'T THAT WEIRD?
- YOU SHOULD BRING SOMEONE
SO IT WON'T BE BORING.

31:35.320 --> 31:38.255
WHAT HAPPENED WITH
THAT MAKEUP ARTIST DANA?
SHE SOUNDED NICE.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.693
YEAH, SHE WAS TOO...
I DON'T KNOW, CHEERFUL
OR SOMETHING.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.327
NOBODY'S PERFECT.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE
A CHANCE TO GROW ON YOU.

31:45.430 --> 31:47.159
YEAH.

31:47.270 --> 31:49.465
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY, BUT...

31:49.570 --> 31:51.162
NO ONE'S YOU.

31:51.270 --> 31:54.034
THAT'S SWEET,
BUT I WAS NEVER ME EITHER.

31:54.140 --> 31:57.303
- YES, YOU WERE--
- NO, IF YOU WERE THIS PICKY
WHEN WE WERE GOING OUT,

31:57.410 --> 31:59.446
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE
MARRIED ME.

31:59.550 --> 32:02.713
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE YOU LIKE AND BE
NICE TO THEM.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.788
IS THAT HOW IT IS
WITH KENNY?

32:04.890 --> 32:07.916
OH.
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

32:08.020 --> 32:10.614
REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED?

32:10.720 --> 32:13.086
UGH, HE'S A PIG.
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

32:13.190 --> 32:15.192
BUT I'M TOO BUSY
FOR ALL THAT NOW.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.598
IT'S OKAY FOR ME.
I DON'T NEED SOMEONE
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.292
OH REALLY?

32:19.400 --> 32:21.630
IT'S NOT A BAD THING,
RICO.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.196
YOU'RE JUST...

32:23.300 --> 32:26.201
A PERSON
WHO DOES BETTER
WITH SOMEONE.

32:31.510 --> 32:34.070
SO TOMORROW,
WHILE I'M AT THE WEDDING

32:34.180 --> 32:36.341
I'M GOING TO HAVE
A HOME AIDE COME
STAY WITH YOU

32:36.450 --> 32:39.180
SO YOU WON'T BE ALONE,
ALL RIGHT?

32:40.420 --> 32:44.652
- WHOSE WEDDING?
- NATE'S. MY SON.

32:44.760 --> 32:47.422
I KNOW WHO NATE IS.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.828
WHO IS HE MARRYING?

32:49.930 --> 32:52.569
BRENDA...
HIS GIRLFRIEND?

32:52.670 --> 32:54.729
OH.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.502
OH!
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

33:00.040 --> 33:01.769
OF COURSE
I'LL BE THERE.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.405
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
PASSAGE FOR NATE

33:04.510 --> 33:07.638
FROM BEING A WIDOWER
TO STARTING AGAIN
AS A HOUSEHOLDER.

33:07.750 --> 33:11.117
- I WANT TO SUPPORT HIM.
- IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S
TOO MUCH FOR YOU.

33:11.220 --> 33:15.008
TOO MUCH?
MY ONLY SON IS
GETTING MARRIED!

33:19.130 --> 33:22.293
WELL, WHY DON'T WE SEE
HOW YOU FEEL TOMORROW?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.994
I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

33:28.500 --> 33:32.334
Host:
The splendid young man
who came to the throne in 1509,

33:32.440 --> 33:37.503
by 1547 had become
a revolting swollen mass
of putrefying flesh.

33:37.610 --> 33:39.908
YOU WANT THE VICODIN
OR SOME NAPROXEN?

33:40.010 --> 33:42.376
- VICODIN PLEASE.
- ALL RIGHT.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.683
HERE.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.553
( sighs )

33:51.060 --> 33:52.880
CRAMPS ARE
PRETTY BAD, HUH?

33:52.990 --> 33:56.096
I JUST WANT TO GET
A WHOLE LOT NUMBER.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.936
GOD, THIS IS
SO NOT THE VISION

34:04.040 --> 34:06.463
I HAD OF THE NIGHT
BEFORE MY WEDDING.

34:08.640 --> 34:11.347
WHERE IS THE STRIPPER?

34:11.450 --> 34:15.079
IT WOULD BE SO EASY
TO POSTPONE THIS FOR
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

34:16.620 --> 34:18.281
IT WOULD NOT BE EASY.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.244
AND IT WOULD
COST A FORTUNE.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.011
SO WHAT?
IT'S JUST MONEY.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.610
I'D RATHER NOT EVEN
HAVE A WEDDING

34:23.720 --> 34:26.450
THAN HAVE TO DEAL
WITH RESCHEDULING
EVERYTHING.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.448
YEAH. YEAH.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.221
( chuckles )

34:30.330 --> 34:33.493
LET'S JUST--
WE CAN RUN OFF TO VEGAS.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.194
- YEAH RIGHT.
- COME ON, YOU LOVED THAT IDEA.

34:36.300 --> 34:40.339
THAT WAS BEFORE I SPENT
SIX MONTHS PLANNING MY STUPID
FUCKING DREAM WEDDING.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.305
THAT'S WHY I THINK
WE SHOULD RESCHEDULE.

34:42.410 --> 34:45.299
IT'S ONLY GOING
TO BE DEPRESSING.

34:45.410 --> 34:47.207
- FOR YOU?
- YEAH, FOR ME!

34:47.310 --> 34:49.972
AND IT'S GOING TO BE DEPRESSING
FOR YOU TOO, I THINK.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.310
IT'S NOT AS DEPRESSING
AS CALLING 100 PEOPLE

34:52.420 --> 34:54.308
AND TELLING THEM
THAT IT'S CANCELED

34:54.420 --> 34:56.559
BECAUSE I LOST
MY FUCKING BABY,

34:56.660 --> 34:58.821
WHICH I JUST TOLD
THE WHOLE WORLD
I WAS HAVING.

34:58.930 --> 35:02.058
WHY DID YOU LET ME TELL
SO MANY FUCKING PEOPLE?

35:02.160 --> 35:03.957
( sobbing )

35:04.060 --> 35:06.290
I JUST--
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU...

35:08.440 --> 35:10.533
I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE
HOW UPSET YOU ARE.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.268
DON'T TELL ME HOW I FEEL!
I THINK I KNOW HOW
UPSET I AM!

35:13.370 --> 35:14.974
THEN WHY ARE WE GOING
THROUGH WITH THIS?

35:15.080 --> 35:16.968
BECAUSE WHEN I THINK
ABOUT NOT DOING IT,

35:17.080 --> 35:19.378
I WANT TO THROW MYSELF
UNDER A BUS.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.243
I WANT TO SWALLOW
RAZOR BLADES.

35:21.350 --> 35:23.773
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE EVERY PAINKILLER
IN THE HOUSE

35:23.880 --> 35:26.246
JUST SO I COULD PICK UP
THE PHONE AND CANCEL
THE CATERER.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.650
THEN FUCK IT!

35:30.760 --> 35:32.785
LET'S GET MARRIED.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.596
OKAY?

35:36.260 --> 35:38.194
IT WILL BE
A GREAT DAY.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.428
YEAH.

35:44.210 --> 35:47.008
YOU CAN HAVE
ONE OF MY VICODIN
IF YOU WANT.

35:47.110 --> 35:48.475
THANK YOU.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.970
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU LEAVE ENOUGH
FOR TOMORROW.

35:52.080 --> 35:55.277
Historian:
...which meant that he
cotantly stank

35:55.380 --> 35:58.281
of rotting flesh.

35:59.950 --> 36:02.180
OH GOD.

36:05.030 --> 36:08.158
Margaret:
ARE THESE BIG GRANNY-PANTIES
YOUR "SOMETHING OLD"?

36:08.260 --> 36:09.693
BECAUSE THEY REALLY
KILL THE MOOD.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.961
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM
THROUGH THE DRESS, CAN YOU?

36:12.070 --> 36:14.538
NO, BUT THEY'RE
HIDEOUS, SWEETIE.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.596
WOULD IT KILL YOU
TO WEAR A THONG?

36:16.700 --> 36:18.133
THESE ARE FINE.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.105
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

36:20.210 --> 36:21.837
NOTHING'S E MATTER.

36:21.940 --> 36:23.703
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO WEAR A THONG.

36:26.850 --> 36:29.978
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
IS IT THE BABY?

36:30.080 --> 36:32.947
( sighs )

36:33.050 --> 36:35.587
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

36:38.930 --> 36:40.955
OH, BABY.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.620
I DON'T WANT TO FUCK UP
MY MAKEUP.

36:43.730 --> 36:46.198
OH, HONEY.
WE'LL CLEAN YOU UP
WITH A GOOD POWDER.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.689
I'VE GOT CHANEL
IN MY PURSE.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.791
I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

36:50.900 --> 36:54.870
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING GOING
RIGHT ANYMORE.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.404
THAT BOAT HAS SAILED.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.348
YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

37:01.450 --> 37:03.509
SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS--

37:03.620 --> 37:08.353
JOANIE, CELIA,
AUNT MARY BEFORE
SHE HAD DEB.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.452
EVEN TERESA HEINZ KERRY
HAD ONE.

37:11.560 --> 37:15.496
AND GOD KNOWS,
SHE LOOKS TERRIFIC.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.319
- AUNT MARY DID?
- I'M TELLING YOU,

37:18.430 --> 37:20.523
MORE WOMEN HAVE
MISCARRIED

37:20.630 --> 37:22.359
THAN THEY HAVE
MASTURBATED WITH A DILDO.

37:22.470 --> 37:25.337
- THEY JUST DON'T
TALK ABOUT IT.
- ( exhales )

37:25.440 --> 37:28.671
AND THEN
THEY HAVE A BABY,

37:28.780 --> 37:31.408
AND THEN THEY'RE FINE,
SWEETIE.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.041
( stammers )

37:39.150 --> 37:41.948
I'D BETTER CHANGE
THIS FUCKING PAD.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.257
IF I GET BLOOD ON THIS DRESS
I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.789
( door closes )

37:48.900 --> 37:53.018
- I'M SO SORRY, NATE.
- YEAH, WELL...

37:54.800 --> 37:56.688
JUST DON'T TELL ANYBODY,
ALL RIGHT?

37:56.800 --> 37:59.360
WE WANT TO KEEP TODAY
KIND OF NICE, YOU KNOW?

38:00.770 --> 38:03.637
( sighs )
ARE YOU GOING
TO TRY AGAIN?

38:03.740 --> 38:06.470
YEAH, OF COURSE,
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

38:06.580 --> 38:09.344
- YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GIVE IT SOME TIME.
- NO NO NO.

38:09.450 --> 38:11.213
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT.

38:11.320 --> 38:14.517
NO, I MEAN, TO GRIEVE.

38:14.620 --> 38:17.384
WITH ALL THE FUCKED UP SHIT
THAT'S HAPPENED IN MY LIFE,

38:17.490 --> 38:19.458
I DON'T WANT
TO GRIEVE ANYMORE.
I CAN'T.

38:19.560 --> 38:22.051
I CAN'T!
I DON'T HAVE IT IN ME.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.497
WELL, MAYBE BRENDA
NEEDS TO--

38:26.600 --> 38:29.068
WHAT BRENDA NEEDS TO DO
IS GET PR'SEOEU’NNT AGAIN.

38:29.170 --> 38:30.967
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
LIKE SHE'S 20.

38:31.070 --> 38:33.937
YEAH, BUT...

38:34.040 --> 38:36.474
WITH ALL THE STUFF KEITH
AND I HAVE BEEN READING,

38:36.580 --> 38:39.140
IT SEEMS
PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS CAN
AFFECT A WOMAN'S CHANCES--

38:39.250 --> 38:42.117
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT'S GONNA MAKE HER
FEEL BETTER!

38:42.220 --> 38:43.471
WHY SHOULD I WAIT?
WHY PUT IT OFF?

38:43.580 --> 38:45.844
BECAUSE BAD SHIT HAPPENED
AND WE NEED TO FEEL BAD?

38:45.950 --> 38:47.417
BAD SHIT HAPPENS
EVERY DAY.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.956
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW THAT.

38:51.060 --> 38:53.449
MOVE FUCKING ON,
YOU KNOW?

38:55.760 --> 38:59.969
ANYWAY,
I'VE ALREADY GOT MAYA
SO IT'S NOT FOR ME.

39:00.070 --> 39:03.665
BUT IT'LL BE YOUR CHILD,
YOUR FLESH AND BLOOD.

39:03.770 --> 39:07.001
- HOW COULD IT NOT BE FOR YOU?
- BECAUSE IT'S WHAT
BRENDA WANTS

39:07.110 --> 39:10.602
MORE THAN ANYTHING,
AND I CAN MAKE THAT
HAPPEN FOR HER.

39:10.710 --> 39:13.804
LISTEN, THE JUSTICE
OF THE PEACE IS HERE.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.117
( sighs )

39:36.500 --> 39:38.661
Brenda:
I TAKE YOU, NATE,

39:38.770 --> 39:41.500
WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTHS
AND FAULTS

39:41.610 --> 39:44.329
AS I OFFER MYSELF TO YOU

39:44.450 --> 39:47.999
WITH ALL MY STRENGTHS
AND FAULTS.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.372
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,

39:51.490 --> 39:53.845
I WILL BE THERE
WHEN YOU NEED HELP

39:53.950 --> 39:56.350
AND TURN TO YOU

39:56.460 --> 39:59.088
WHEN I NEED HELP.

40:02.330 --> 40:06.096
I PROMISE MYSELF
TO YOU FOREVER.

40:08.770 --> 40:11.398
Nate:
I VOW TO TRUST,

40:11.510 --> 40:14.479
TO HONOR
AND TO CHERISH,

40:14.580 --> 40:17.435
TO SHARE AND SUPPORT
YOUR HOPES,

40:17.540 --> 40:19.599
YOUR THOUGHTS
AND YOUR DREAMS

40:19.710 --> 40:23.874
AS LONG AS WE BOTH
SHALL LIVE.

40:35.730 --> 40:39.621
BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

40:39.730 --> 40:42.665
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

40:42.770 --> 40:45.830
- YOU MAY KI_SS THE BRIDE.
- ( snickers )

41:14.500 --> 41:17.936
( film rewinds )

41:18.040 --> 41:21.066
SO IS IT WEIRD
TO SEE BRENDA
GET MARRIED?

41:21.170 --> 41:22.899
"WEIRD"?

41:23.010 --> 41:24.500
NO, IT'S GREAT.

41:24.610 --> 41:28.068
I MEAN,
BECAUSE YOU GUYS
USED TO BE SO CLOSE?

41:28.180 --> 41:31.069
I'M REALLY HAPPY.

41:32.590 --> 41:36.185
I'M HAPPY WE'RE BOTH
IN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS.

41:36.290 --> 41:38.929
WITH SIBLINGS.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.383
HMM?

41:40.490 --> 41:43.857
IT'S FUNNY HOW YOU BOTH
ENDED UP WITH ANOTHER
SET OF SIBLINGS.

41:45.430 --> 41:47.398
YEAH, YEAH.

41:47.500 --> 41:51.493
IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU
AND NATE DID TOO.

41:51.610 --> 41:54.170
GOD, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT MEANS?

41:58.680 --> 42:01.615
- IT WAS
A NICE CEREMONY.
- IT WAS.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.917
YOU GOT A LITTLE
CHOKED UP, DIDN'T YOU?

42:05.020 --> 42:07.147
YEAH.

42:07.250 --> 42:09.059
I LOVE WEDDINGS.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.650
DON'T YOU?

42:10.760 --> 42:12.921
SURE.
IF IT'S RIGHT.

42:13.030 --> 42:15.590
THE LAST ONE I WENT TO,
THE PEOPLE HATED
EACH OTHER,

42:15.700 --> 42:18.453
- SO IT WAS DEPRESSING.
- Margaret: GOD DAMN IT!

42:18.570 --> 42:20.492
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING TO
NOT BE ABLE TO HELP HER!

42:20.600 --> 42:22.136
BUT YOU DID HELP HER.

42:22.240 --> 42:26.131
YOU HELPED HER
AS MUCH AS ANYONE COULD
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.800
I DON'T KNOW.
I REALLY BELIEVE
IN MARRIAGE.

42:28.910 --> 42:31.640
A LOT OF GUYS TODAY
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A COMMITMENT,

42:31.750 --> 42:34.742
BUT I WAS MARRIED
11 YEARS.

42:34.850 --> 42:37.648
I'M THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO'S BETTER WITH SOMEONE.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.738
SOMEONE SPECIAL,
I MEAN.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.620
THAT'S SWEET.

42:45.730 --> 42:49.188
Man:
THEY COULDN'T HAVE PICKED
A PRE'I'I'IER LOCATION.

42:49.300 --> 42:52.394
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.889
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH
OF THAT ONE.
- ALL RIGHT.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.197
LOVELY!
A FAMILY PORTRAIT
WITH TWO NEW FISHERS.

42:59.940 --> 43:01.703
OH.

43:08.150 --> 43:12.519
- OKAY, WHAT'S NEXT?
- HOW ABOUT MOM AND GEORGE?

43:12.620 --> 43:15.009
Brenda:
OKAY, I'M JUST
GONNA FRESHEN UP.

43:15.120 --> 43:18.089
OKAY, MOM.
YOU GUYS WANNA GET
OVER HERE IN THE LIGHT?

43:22.730 --> 43:25.665
- LET ME TAKE THAT GLASS.
- MOM, IT'S FINE.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.990
OH.

43:31.810 --> 43:33.107
George:
SORRY.

43:34.540 --> 43:37.134
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT?

43:37.240 --> 43:40.175
HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT!

43:40.280 --> 43:42.248
- ( George chuckles )
- OH MY GOD.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.038
( Ruth shouts )
IT'S NOT FUNNY!

43:46.520 --> 43:48.112
OH MY.

43:52.590 --> 43:55.957
- MAY I HAVE SOME
SELTZER PLEASE, NO ICE?
- YES, MA'AM.

43:56.060 --> 43:57.994
- MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M FINE.

43:58.100 --> 44:01.592
- WHAT HAPPENED WITH CLAIRE?
- SHE'S IN PHEEEA TERRIBLE

44:01.700 --> 44:03.133
SHE'S SO OUT OF CONTROL
IN HER LIFE,

44:03.240 --> 44:05.265
SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
ANYONE ELSE'S FEELINGS.

44:05.370 --> 44:08.100
- WHAT DID SHE DO?
- SHE TOOK A RUDE PICTURE
OF GEORGE

44:08.210 --> 44:10.804
IN AN EXTREMELY
COMPROMISED STATE.
THERE'S ICE IN THIS.

44:10.910 --> 44:13.470
- SORRY.
- I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T
MEAN IT THAT WAY.

44:13.580 --> 44:15.172
SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO MAKE SOME STATEMENT!

44:15.280 --> 44:17.271
YES, THIS IS HER WAY
OF SAYING I'M THE FOOL

44:17.380 --> 44:20.144
WHO HAS TO TAKE CARE
OF A CRAZY PERSON FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE!

44:20.250 --> 44:22.115
I DON'T THINK SHE WAS
TRYING TO SAY THAT.

44:22.220 --> 44:25.280
I DON'T NEED A PHOTOGRAPH.
I DON'T NEED TO HAVE MY FACE
SHOVED IN IT.

44:25.390 --> 44:28.223
- MOM, WE'LL GET YOU SOME HELP,
A NURSE OR SOMETHING.
- GOD! NO!

44:28.330 --> 44:30.890
I'M STILL THE ONE WHO HAS
TO BE THERE ALL DAY
AND EVERY NIGHT.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.992
- WHY DO YOU--?
- ( shouts ) BECAUSE
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE!

44:34.100 --> 44:35.260
( sighs )

44:39.170 --> 44:40.398
EXCUSE ME, DEAR.

44:40.510 --> 44:43.229
I HAVE TO CLEAN
THE STAIN ON HIS JACKET
BEFORE IT SETS.

44:51.150 --> 44:53.141
OH, THANK YOU.

44:53.250 --> 44:54.751
WHO'S THE THIRD ONE FOR?

44:54.860 --> 44:56.589
THAT'S TO PUT
UNDER OUR PILLOW.

44:56.690 --> 44:58.055
( chuckles )

44:58.160 --> 45:00.754
SO WHO DO YOU DREAM OF
IF YOU'RE ALREADY MARRIED?

45:00.860 --> 45:03.454
YOU DREAM
OF A FUTURE LOVE.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.562
YOU MEAN
OUR SECOND HUSBANDS?

45:05.670 --> 45:07.467
NO. WE COULD DREAM
OF OUR CHILD.

45:07.570 --> 45:10.937
OR JUST GET FROSTING
IN OUR EARS.

45:11.040 --> 45:13.929
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FORWARD
WITH THE SURROGATE.

45:15.180 --> 45:17.501
REALLY? WHY?

45:17.610 --> 45:19.498
BECAUSE YOU WANT
YOUR OWN CHILD.

45:19.610 --> 45:21.043
AND...

45:21.150 --> 45:23.118
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE
WHO DENIES YOU THAT.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.485
I WANT TO BE THE ONE
WHO HELPS YOU TO HAVE
WHAT YOU WANT.

45:28.190 --> 45:30.249
WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS
WHO NEED HOMES?

45:30.360 --> 45:34.126
WE CAN DO BOTH.
I THINK WE SHOULD DO BOTH.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.252
ONE OF EACH?

45:37.360 --> 45:39.066
WHICH ONE
COMES FIRST?

45:39.170 --> 45:42.697
WHICH EVER
SHOWS UP FIRST.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.007
WHAT IF
THEY BOTH SHOW UP
AT THE SAME TIME?

45:45.110 --> 45:46.862
THEN WE'LL BE REALLY BUSY.

45:46.970 --> 45:48.562
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

45:48.670 --> 45:50.274
MM-HM.

45:52.480 --> 45:54.175
ALL RIGHT THEN.

46:10.330 --> 46:11.991
( sighs )

46:28.450 --> 46:31.419
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT IT BEING LIKE
MY WEDDING.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.011
I HAD
A THREE-MONTH-OLD BABY
WHEN I GOT MARRIED,

46:34.120 --> 46:36.554
SO IT WAS A MUCH
HAPPIER EVENT, OBVIOUSLY.

46:36.660 --> 46:38.719
REALLY JOYFUL.

46:38.830 --> 46:40.752
IT ALL CAME
VERY NATURALLY TO ME.

46:40.860 --> 46:42.999
BUT I WAS ALWAYS
MATERNAL, UNLIKE YOU.

46:43.100 --> 46:44.522
I'M FUCKING MATERNAL.

46:44.630 --> 46:46.769
OH, COME ON.
LOOK AT YOUR PAST.

46:46.870 --> 46:48.428
WHAT ABOUT MY PAST?

46:48.530 --> 46:50.191
YOU'RE A SLUTBAG!
YOU WERE.

46:50.300 --> 46:52.803
- THAT'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
- OF COURSE IT DOES.

46:52.910 --> 46:55.879
ALL THE MOMENTS
OF YOUR LIFE HAVE
LED TO THIS ONE.

46:55.980 --> 47:00.201
- YOU'RE BEING PUNISHED.
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT.

47:00.310 --> 47:03.347
YOUR INSIDES MUST
HAVE GOTTEN DAMAGED FROM
ALL THAT ANONYMOUS COCK.

47:03.450 --> 47:06.783
OH, COME ON.
THAT'S WHY THIS
HAPPENED TO YOU.

47:06.890 --> 47:09.586
Lisa:
LOOK AT THAT
NICE WOMAN OVER THERE.

47:09.690 --> 47:11.385
SHE'S GOT HER BABY.

47:11.490 --> 47:15.256
EVERYBODY TREATED
HER LIKE A PRINCESS
FOR THE WHOLE NINE MONTHS.

47:15.360 --> 47:18.727
THERE'S A PREGNANT GODDESS,
DUE IN SIX WEEKS.

47:18.830 --> 47:20.468
SHE HAS TWO AT HOME.

47:20.570 --> 47:23.459
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET,
BUT SHE'S PREGNANT.

47:23.570 --> 47:25.265
SHE WASN'T EVEN TRYING!

47:25.370 --> 47:27.361
BOY, IS SHE GOING
TO BE THRILLED.
TWINS!

47:27.470 --> 47:29.176
THEY'LL BE HERE
IN JUNE.

47:29.280 --> 47:31.271
I'M GONNA GET
MY BABY, YOU BITCH.

47:31.380 --> 47:34.474
I GOT PREGNANT
THE FOURTH TIME
I TRIED.

47:34.580 --> 47:36.218
I DIDN'T HAVE TO TRY.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.141
BUT I NEVER PARTIED
LIKE YOU DID.

47:39.250 --> 47:40.182
WHEW!

47:40.290 --> 47:42.178
IT'S A MIRACLE
YOU EVEN CONCEIVED!

47:42.290 --> 47:44.110
A LOT OF WOMEN
HAVE MISCARRIAGES!

47:44.220 --> 47:47.223
THEY DON'T TALK
ABOUT IT SO PEOPLE
DON'T REALIZE.

47:47.330 --> 47:48.991
NONE OF THE WOMEN
AT THIS WEDDING HAVE.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.988
EXCEPT YOU, OF COURSE.

47:51.100 --> 47:54.228
YOU'RE JUST BITTER BECAUSE
YOU HAD TO GET PREGNANT
TO GET NATE TO MARRY YOU.

47:54.330 --> 47:56.798
I'M BITTER?
WHO'S DRUNK AND YELLING
AT A DEAD WOMAN?

47:56.900 --> 47:58.367
AND SHE MIGHT NOT
EVEN BE HIS DAUGHTER!

47:58.470 --> 48:00.904
YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH YOUR SISTER'S HUSBAND!

48:01.010 --> 48:03.308
THAT WAS PURELY
A SPIRITUAL THING.

48:04.480 --> 48:06.072
NATE IS MAYA'S FATHER.

48:06.180 --> 48:09.115
HE'S MY HUSBAND,
AND HE ALWAYS WILL BE.

48:09.220 --> 48:11.745
YOU WILL NEVER FEEL
HIS ARMS AROUND YOU AGAIN.

48:11.850 --> 48:13.784
YOU'LL NEVER FEEL
THE AIR ON YOUR SKIN,

48:13.890 --> 48:15.653
OR WAKE UP IN A WARM BED.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.113
YOU'RE DONE.

48:17.220 --> 48:19.552
YOU DON'T GET THE CHANCE
TO TRY AGAIN FOR ANYTHING.

48:19.660 --> 48:21.389
- SO WHAT?
- SO I CAN.

48:21.490 --> 48:22.855
OH, PLEASE.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.497
EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO HAVE
A NICE NORMAL LIFE,

48:25.600 --> 48:27.261
YOU FUCK IT UP.

48:27.370 --> 48:29.998
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE
YOUR HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER
MOMENT,

48:30.100 --> 48:31.863
NO MATTER HOW MANY
WHITE VEILS YOU PUT ON.

48:31.970 --> 48:34.131
YOU'RE JUST TOO FUCKED UP
FOR ALL THAT.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.276
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST ACCEPT THAT,

48:36.380 --> 48:38.109
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BE
SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT.

48:52.230 --> 48:53.481
HEY.

48:54.930 --> 48:56.522
ARE YOU OKAY?

48:58.200 --> 49:00.521
- BREN?
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

49:00.630 --> 49:03.235
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TRIED
TO HAVE THIS STUPID DAY,

49:03.340 --> 49:06.059
THIS IDIOTIC TENT,
THE DUMB-ASS WEDDING BAND.

49:06.170 --> 49:07.808
- IT'S SUCH A FUCKING CLICHE.
- HEY--

49:07.910 --> 49:12.472
JUST TO PROVE
THAT I DESERVE MY OWN
SPECIAL FUCKING DAY,

49:12.580 --> 49:13.979
WHICH I DON'T.

49:14.080 --> 49:15.968
BRENDA,
THE ONLY REASON--

49:16.080 --> 49:18.412
- THE ONLY REASON WHY I--
- NO, COME ON!

49:18.520 --> 49:22.650
YOU KNEW. IT WAS
A PATH ETIC ATTEMPT TO
BECOME SOMETHING I'M NOT--

49:22.760 --> 49:26.526
- THAT WE'RE NOT.
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
TOO UPSET TO ENJOY THE DAY.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.780
BUT IT'S SO PERFECT THIS WAY!
IT'S SO PERFECT.

49:28.890 --> 49:32.121
THE ONLY WAY THAT
I GET TO GET MARRIED
IN A LONG WHITE GOWN

49:32.230 --> 49:35.688
IS TO HAVE MY DEAD BABY
LEAKING OUT OF ME ALL DAY.

49:35.800 --> 49:38.735
THAT'S ME.
THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR MY WEDDING.

49:38.840 --> 49:42.435
- YOU'RE REALLY UPSET, MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

49:42.540 --> 49:46.374
THIS GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE IS
THE ONLY THING IN MY UNIVERSE
RIGHT NOW.

49:46.480 --> 49:48.277
YOU HAVE ME.

49:50.380 --> 49:52.689
YOU DON'T REALLY
FUCKING WANT ME.

49:54.150 --> 49:56.812
NOT THAT I BLAME YOU.

49:56.920 --> 49:58.808
WHO WOULD?

49:58.920 --> 50:01.059
I DO.

50:01.160 --> 50:03.799
WELL THEN, YOU'RE A VERY
DISTURBED PERSON.

50:03.900 --> 50:05.094
MAYBE.

50:05.200 --> 50:06.929
DON'T BE NICE TO ME!

50:07.030 --> 50:08.895
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.888
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO HIT YOU?
- YES!

50:11.000 --> 50:13.207
THAT WOULD FEEL
FUCKING FANTASTIC!

50:15.610 --> 50:17.134
COME HERE.

50:17.240 --> 50:19.470
- ( sobs)
- OH.

50:19.580 --> 50:21.571
( whimpers )

50:26.390 --> 50:27.982
OH...

50:28.090 --> 50:30.388
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO HIT ME.

50:30.490 --> 50:33.323
NO. I'M DISTURBED,
I'M NOT VIOLENT.

50:33.430 --> 50:35.751
YOU WERE WHEN YOU THREW
YOUR RING AT ME.

50:35.860 --> 50:38.090
OH, MEMORIES.

50:40.270 --> 50:43.194
I'M GLAD TODAY SUCKED--

50:43.300 --> 50:45.165
'CAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT
THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF OUR LIFE

50:45.270 --> 50:48.330
TO BE OVER ALREADY,
WOULD YOU?

50:48.440 --> 50:49.668
NO.

50:49.780 --> 50:51.975
IT'S COMING, RIGHT?
IT'S COMING.

50:52.080 --> 50:53.877
IT FUCKING BETTER BE.

50:53.980 --> 50:56.414
( sighs )

51:02.390 --> 51:07.589
( jazz musiclaying )

51:07.690 --> 51:09.726
( crowd applauding )

51:57.210 --> 51:58.700
( seagull squawks )

52:26.870 --> 52:28.861
BREN DA?

52:30.040 --> 52:32.349
( sighs )

52:32.450 --> 52:35.419
OH, I'M SORRY.
YOU CAN'T COME IN
FOR THIS.

52:41.150 --> 52:43.516
CAN YOU HOLD THIS?

52:59.310 --> 53:01.266
( sighs )

53:14.120 --> 53:16.680
( sobbing )

53:30.300 --> 53:35.579
* DID YOU SAY I'VE GOT
A LOT TO LEARN? *

53:37.880 --> 53:44.615
* WELL, DON'T THINK
I'M TRYING NOT TO LEARN *

53:44.720 --> 53:49.384
* SINCE THIS IS
THE PERFECT SPOT TO LEARN *

53:50.860 --> 53:52.782
* OOH...

53:52.890 --> 53:55.256
* TEACH ME TONIGHT

53:57.600 --> 54:02.333
* LET'S START
WITH THE A-B-C OF IT *

54:04.270 --> 54:09.333
* ROLL RIGHT DOWN
TO THE X-Y-Z OF IT *

54:10.810 --> 54:15.372
* HELP ME SOLVE
THE MYSTERY OF IT *

54:17.120 --> 54:23.559
* COME ON
AND TEACH ME TONIGHT. *
