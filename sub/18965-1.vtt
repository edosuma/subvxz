ELIZABETH:
It's been three years

00:16.224 --> 00:18.310
since I left
the comforts of big city life

00:18.310 --> 00:21.271
to teach school in
the little town of Hope Valley.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.525
Every winter I spend here,

00:24.525 --> 00:25.860
I become more convinced

00:25.860 --> 00:27.528
that there's nothing
more beautiful

00:27.528 --> 00:30.948
than Christmas
in my frontier home.

00:30.948 --> 00:34.743
It was a difficult year
for many of our new neighbors.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.537
The people who settled
near the river

00:36.537 --> 00:38.747
saw their homes swept away
in a flood.

00:38.747 --> 00:42.668
Some even lost beloved husbands
and fathers.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.795
But in the true spirit
of giving,

00:44.795 --> 00:46.964
our town has joined together,

00:46.964 --> 00:48.799
promising to those
less fortunate

00:48.799 --> 00:52.803
a holiday filled with comfort
and joy.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.977
This is a long list.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.563
I am in charge of the Christmas
Committee this year.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.773
It's, uh, it's
a bigger order than usual.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.275
Well, there's extra for the
families from the settlement.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.152
It's the least we can do
to show them we care.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.613
I agree a hundred percent.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.408
So do you think you can get it
all here before Christmas Eve?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.326
It shouldn't be a problem.
Great!

01:16.326 --> 01:18.119
I'll come by later
with the grocery order.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.788
I wonder what
Miss LeVeaux will say

01:19.788 --> 01:22.958
when she hears
you've taken over her committee.

01:22.958 --> 01:26.378

away on her honeymoon

I heard they're due back today.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.633
And I'm sure Rosemary
will be delighted

01:31.633 --> 01:34.970
that someone volunteered
in her absence.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.848
You don't actually
believe that, do you?

01:52.404 --> 01:54.823
Um... How about right here,
in the center of town?

01:54.823 --> 01:57.993

the perfect place to me.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.166
How's the work coming?
Good!

02:05.166 --> 02:07.044
We finished the attic
in Mrs. Sullivan's,

02:07.044 --> 02:09.630
and we're just started work
over the dentist's office.

02:09.630 --> 02:13.258
And what about the old houses
by the north road?

02:13.258 --> 02:15.469
The seven houses are
gonna take some time.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.639
To tell the truth, I need to
find a few men to lend a hand.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.308
Oh, there's
the Lawson family.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.770
I was thinking the apartment
below Dottie's

02:24.770 --> 02:26.605
would be perfect for them.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.482
Thanks.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.191
Elizabeth...

02:30.191 --> 02:32.945

how we're going

02:47.250 --> 02:49.086
to pull off
a Christmas Eve banquet.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.671
And this
building project,

02:50.671 --> 02:53.007
if you ask me,
it's far too ambitious.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.633
I think
it's fantastic.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.927
Any word on when Mayor Gowen
is coming back?

02:56.927 --> 02:59.513
Faith was going to check on him
while she was in Union City,

02:59.513 --> 03:00.848

03:00.848 --> 03:02.683
Well, I really think
it's time for you

03:02.683 --> 03:04.685
to officially step in
as mayor, Abigail.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.687
You are head of
the town council,

03:06.687 --> 03:09.773
and the town bylaws state
that when the Mayor is absent,

03:09.773 --> 03:12.151

assumes the leadership role.
