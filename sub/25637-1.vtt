[Woman on tv]
How can you say that?

01:17.545 --> 01:19.713
Why didn't I listen?

01:19.747 --> 01:23.584
-Lainey? -I should've known
that she was telling the truth.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.687
She always did.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.456
Vivian is gone.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.365
Lainey?

01:52.213 --> 01:53.314
Lainey!

Lainey.

Lainey!

02:14.335 --> 02:17.305
Val, she's gone.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.772
I don't know.
I can't find her.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.808
We had a fight,
and I yelled at her,

02:20.841 --> 02:22.910
and I don't know
if she's angry

02:22.943 --> 02:24.445
and she's doing this
on purpose

02:24.478 --> 02:26.647
or I don't know if something
happened to her.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.382
I don't know where she went.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.727
You don't want
what's best for ed.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.695
You want what's best
for yourself.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.665
It would break him to know that
you were here. It really would.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.735
I think we both have secrets,
Vivian.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.504
-Me?
-You said it yourself.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.839
It would break him.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.375
I have more decency
in my worst mistakes

02:54.408 --> 02:57.445
than you have

Okay, I know nothing's
been signed or sealed

03:37.785 --> 03:39.420
or anything like that,
but come on.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.721
"Valley Springs"
is your home.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.590
-It always will be your home.
-I know.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.692
And my home,
if she gets resigned.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.295
It's important.
I need a job.

-[Man] I look like I'm drunk. -Well,
you always look like you're drunk.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.437
But I'm not.
I had, like, one scotch.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.005
Listen. Sober up. I wanna
introduce you to somebody.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.808
-Excuse us.
-[Man] You look great.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.914
-Hi.
-Are you making friends?

04:06.947 --> 04:08.816
Well, yeah.

04:08.849 --> 04:09.950

-How are you?

04:09.983 --> 04:11.685
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.354
Lainey, you remember Aden
from "Hollywood tonight."

04:13.387 --> 04:15.055
Of course I do.
It's good see you.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.558
We're going to be doing
a really nice feature on you,

[distant crew chatter]

04:53.427 --> 04:55.062
[Whispering lines]

04:58.466 --> 05:00.401
I can't. These--
these are not sticking.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.435
They're not sticking.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.003
And i--

05:03.036 --> 05:04.872
you know what? Because
they're badly written lines.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.375
They're just bad,
and they don't make sense.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.809
Well,
you make them make sense.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.043
That's what you do.

I'll send them flowers.

to do a follow up.

You just met him.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.736
There were
a lot of people there.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.738
I really don't remember him.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.940

I had one drink.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.052
-Just one drink?
-I had three drinks.

to manipulate

06:05.466 --> 06:06.634
back into Casey's life,

another thing coming.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.370
That's...

06:12.440 --> 06:15.643
I'm sorry. Hang on.
Let me do that again.

you're going to manipulate

-Fine.
-Something going on?

06:45.573 --> 06:46.707
Nope.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.443
Something I should know about?

06:49.477 --> 06:52.580
Aside from the dialogue rolling off
the tongue like a lead balloon,

06:52.613 --> 06:54.548
no, everything's fine.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.183
Okay, well,
take all the time you need.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.588
No. No, I'm fine.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.996
Okay, everybody, settle down.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.766
And five, four, three...

I--

07:49.069 --> 07:50.938
I'm not going to be an extra
on my own show.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.840
They want you to renew.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.508
Yeah, to be a talking prop.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.976
More funerals and weddings

07:56.009 --> 07:57.778
-and group scenes.
-No.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.681
No, val said that you had
a worthwhile storyline coming.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.916
I thought you wanted to spend
more time with me.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.218
I do, but the show is--
is your whole life.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.154
It's who you are.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.957
So you're worried there's not
going to be anything left?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.759
I did not say that.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.060
You didn't have to.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.841
So this is it?

08:27.875 --> 08:30.177
Huh.

08:30.210 --> 08:33.212
I think it's
a really good idea.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.816
It's not something
that I expected from you,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.818
but I'm excited.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.119
And I think you're right,

08:39.152 --> 08:42.188
a change of scene
will do us good.

[Chuckles]

08:57.104 --> 08:58.872

09:17.691 --> 09:19.693
Stop it.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.962
I'm having a moment,
a very traumatic moment.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.697

It's pretty.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.618
It's pretty.
I'll give you that.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.720
It's nice. Yeah.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.255
-You love it.
-It's pretty.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.757
You love it.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.866
-Is that a prerequisite?
-Hmm.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.794
What do you think?
Too much?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.797
No. No, that's perfect.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.931
You know what? Better yet,

10:30.964 --> 10:32.800
let's use it as a mug tree.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.641
[Seagulls squawking]

10:42.475 --> 10:45.178
To new opportunities.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.681
To going to bed early
and waking up late.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.016
To taking afternoon naps.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.017
[Laughs]

10:50.050 --> 10:51.852
To matching jogging suits.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.756
But not--
not the swishy kind.

[Blinds zipping]

11:19.446 --> 11:21.048
How about
we go to breakfast?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.820
Uh, love that idea.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.188
In two hours.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.892
Oh, no. Stop!

11:31.925 --> 11:33.460
-Come on.
-Why are you up?

11:33.493 --> 11:35.863
I can't break a habit
like that overnight. Come on.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.298
-Come here.
-No. Up.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.000
You're up. I know.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.305
Come on.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.740
No, no, no.

11:47.841 --> 11:48.976
No.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.443
It's going to be
a beautiful day.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.212
Okay.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.322
I could get used to seeing you
like this.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.025
A little downtime before we
get everything figured out.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.895
I don't mind a little downtime
when there's uptime to plan for.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.262
[Laughing]
It's true.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.177

Oh, my goodness.

12:30.450 --> 12:34.021
I could hardly believe it when
they told me you were here.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.923
I'm Julie. I'm the owner.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.057
Hi.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.391
Love the show.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.526
We've watched you
for years.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.995
Oh, thank you. I'm glad.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.431
I am just--
i am just gonna be so sad

12:44.464 --> 12:45.799
to see you go.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.235
It won't be the
same without you.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.302
Thanks.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.138
[Laughing]

12:51.171 --> 12:52.572
Gosh, just think.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.975
Here I was sad to see you
leave the "valley,"

12:55.008 --> 12:57.310
and you've gone and done
something so much better

12:57.344 --> 12:59.813
and showed up right here
in my own place.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.915
[Laughs]

13:04.484 --> 13:07.120
How long are you in town?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.322
We're renting a place here.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.258
You are.

13:11.291 --> 13:15.195
[Sighs] Don't you just love our
little corner of the world?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.464
Well, you know what?
I know everyone in town.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.067
If you need anything,
you just ask me.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.102
I'll introduce you around.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.571
I'll fast track you into
all the right circles,

13:24.604 --> 13:26.339
make sure you--

13:26.373 --> 13:28.508
have a good time
and meet the right people.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.878
-Well, we came to the right place.
-We did.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.179
Your home away from home.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.214
Thank you.
Can we just get the check?

13:35.482 --> 13:38.418
Absolutely not.
It's on the house.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.254
Oh, thank you. Yeah.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.822
-Okay.

Oh, Vivian-- Lainey...

13:49.162 --> 13:51.164
-Your purse.
-Oh.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.321
[Chuckles]

14:14.354 --> 14:16.556
We met for the first time
right before this shoot.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.258
Do you remember?

14:18.291 --> 14:19.492
You remember that?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.061
Of course I do.
Don't you?

14:21.094 --> 14:24.664
Yeah, I remember that,
but we didn't speak.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.266
I didn't think you remembered.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.136
Well, I may have started life
in a closet,

14:29.169 --> 14:31.238
but it's Vivian
who's going to end up there.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.149
[Thuds]

14:48.588 --> 14:51.324
You think I'll ever do anything
i can be proud of again?

14:51.358 --> 14:53.160
Oh.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.128
Of course you will.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.667
Hmm.
[Chuckling]

15:00.700 --> 15:03.170
-Why do we have a beanbag?
-I don't know.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.207
[Soft music playing]

15:07.240 --> 15:08.308
That's a sad move.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.110
What?

15:12.645 --> 15:13.646
Hmm.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.385
? I like a day that's clear

15:18.418 --> 15:20.587
? or at least a night so bright,
it chases darkness... ?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.189
-oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.557
That's a good move
if you're a giant cheater.

15:26.093 --> 15:29.029
[Music continues]

15:29.062 --> 15:31.431
Lainey, what are you doing?

15:31.464 --> 15:33.666
Do you not want to play
anymore?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.502
Are you bored?

15:35.535 --> 15:37.304
[Gasps]

15:37.337 --> 15:39.439
[Laughing]

15:54.621 --> 15:55.722
Here.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.394
Thanks.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.431
You seem distracted.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.300
Is it stress?

16:07.334 --> 16:10.403
From five shows a week working

16:10.437 --> 16:12.039
to deciding
where the toaster goes?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.141
I think I can handle it.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.608
I am going out of my mind.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.045
I'm glad you have
so many reasons to be happy.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.612
-No, that's not what I meant.
-That makes me feel great.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.148
That's not what I meant.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.715
Well, what did you mean
the other five times

16:22.749 --> 16:24.684
you've mentioned
how pointless it is

16:24.717 --> 16:26.119
since we got here?

16:26.153 --> 16:27.320
I'm happy to be here with you.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.156
I've never doubted that,
but...

16:29.189 --> 16:31.691
Work has been a big part
of my life, and it's gone,

16:31.724 --> 16:34.694
so can you just
not take it personally

16:34.727 --> 16:36.296
until I figure this out?

16:38.365 --> 16:42.702
I love you.
I love spending time with you.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.138
But now that you're spending
so much time around me,

16:45.172 --> 16:47.407
maybe I'm just afraid

16:47.440 --> 16:51.111
that you're not going to be able
to find things to still love.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.681
It's not even a question.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.732
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.602
So, val and Jason are driving
through next weekend.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.137
They're headed up the coast.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.172
They wanted to see
if they could stop in.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.308
Yeah, sounds good.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.410
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, sounds good.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.112
[Muttering]
Sounds good.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.187
I hate this house.
You can't find anything.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.481
You want some?

18:03.816 --> 18:05.752
So between
my son's brain hemorrhage

18:05.785 --> 18:07.254
and saying good-bye
to three exes,

18:07.287 --> 18:09.122
I am no stranger
to a doctor's office.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.690
[Chuckles]
Well, all we're going to do

18:10.723 --> 18:12.492
is check that
your short-term memory

18:12.525 --> 18:14.527
and your cognitive
functioning are--

18:14.561 --> 18:16.496
they're all
where they should be. Okay?

18:16.529 --> 18:19.632
She's forgetting
small household things,

18:19.666 --> 18:21.334
you know, where things go,

18:21.368 --> 18:23.670
their names,
things we've talked about.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.139
It-- it's
a concentration thing.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.475
I'm not concentrating
because I don't care.

18:28.508 --> 18:33.513
Right. Well, have you
experienced changes in mood?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.815
Depression? Loss of interest?

18:35.848 --> 18:38.585
Nope. My memory is just fine.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.788
This is why we're here,

18:41.821 --> 18:42.855
'cause it's-- you know,

18:42.889 --> 18:44.491
just seems kind of sudden.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.159
You know,
seeing as you are here,

18:46.193 --> 18:47.627
there's no reason
not to go through

18:47.660 --> 18:49.496
with what we call
a mini cog test.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.698
And it just means
I'm going to say three items,

18:51.731 --> 18:53.900
and I'd like you
to repeat them back to me.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.368
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

18:55.402 --> 18:58.671
Spoon, chair, tree.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.743
Spoon, chair, tree.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.178
Good. Easy, right?

19:05.212 --> 19:06.579
So just try to remember those,

19:06.613 --> 19:09.316
and in a minute I'll ask you
to repeat them.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.651
Now, I would also
usually ask you

19:11.684 --> 19:14.221
to draw the numbers
on a clock face for me,

19:14.254 --> 19:16.223
if you would.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.228
Ah, look at that.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.197
It's a-- it's a beautiful part
of the world there by the ocean.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.798
It's gorgeous.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.268
It just gets more beautiful
as you drive up that coast.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.270
-It does. -Always wanted to
get a place by the water.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.671
-You should.
-Yeah?

19:31.704 --> 19:34.641
All right, good.
We're nearly done here.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.710
Lainey, just repeat
those three items for me,

19:37.744 --> 19:39.646
if you would?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.750
-Lainey.
-Yeah.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.785
Um...

19:47.787 --> 19:48.821
Chair.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.457
Chair...

19:51.858 --> 19:53.460
Spoon. You said spoon.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.229
Um, this is crazy.
Come on.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.397
I could remember these easily,

19:57.430 --> 19:58.898
but they're abstract.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.000
They have no context
or meaning, right?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.269
This is silly.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.572
It doesn't make any sense.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.743
Okay, um...

20:12.445 --> 20:15.782
All right, well, there's--

20:15.815 --> 20:17.517
there's one more thing
i could recommend--

20:17.550 --> 20:19.986
a neuroimaging scan.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.921
That'll give us
a good place to start.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.369
Six weeks?

21:09.402 --> 21:11.638
You're not going to do
anything?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.409
Okay.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.844
Thank you. I will.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.581
Who was that?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.583
The doctor.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.686
Is he not talking
to me directly?

21:26.719 --> 21:30.390
Am I officially incompetent?
Are you my legal guardian?

21:30.423 --> 21:31.924
I called him.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.726
Hiding in the bedroom.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.395
I'm not hiding.
He left a message,

21:35.428 --> 21:36.629
and you never play them,

21:36.663 --> 21:38.731
even when the light
is blinking.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.337
Okay.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.973
Do you want to tell me?

21:48.007 --> 21:50.477
Um, the scan is clear.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.811
Okay.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.113
All right.
That's great, right?

21:54.146 --> 21:58.718
Yeah, it rules out
a lot of serious problems,

21:58.751 --> 22:02.121
but they ran a blood test

22:02.154 --> 22:05.525
for a gene,

22:05.558 --> 22:07.026
an inherited gene.

22:07.059 --> 22:10.563
It's the early onset
indicator.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.066
Oh.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.670
Wow.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.474
You knew.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.009
You knew that
this was a possibility,

22:23.042 --> 22:24.777
and you didn't tell me?

22:26.546 --> 22:29.549
What would you have done
if I had told you?

22:29.582 --> 22:31.384
That's why we're here.

22:32.452 --> 22:33.820
Because you were afraid

22:33.853 --> 22:36.122
this was happening to you,

22:36.155 --> 22:38.357
and you didn't tell me?

22:44.030 --> 22:45.765
You're so calm.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.934
How can you be so calm?

22:47.967 --> 22:49.636
You didn't think
it might be helpful

22:49.669 --> 22:51.471
to tell me,

22:51.504 --> 22:55.107
that maybe I would like to have
time to process this, too?

22:55.141 --> 22:56.609
I didn't know for sure.

22:56.643 --> 22:59.612
It was a 50% chance.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.848
They said it was a 50% chance.

23:05.452 --> 23:06.886
If I had told you,

23:06.919 --> 23:11.023
you would've spent
the last ten years of our lives

23:11.057 --> 23:13.125
waiting for this day
just like I have.

23:24.571 --> 23:25.805
Well, at least I know

23:25.838 --> 23:27.907
we won't pass it along
to our kids.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.481
Can we get out of here?

23:50.763 --> 23:52.799
You'll never guess
what I hunted down,

23:52.832 --> 23:54.901
and I just couldn't pass up
the opportunity

23:54.934 --> 23:56.536
to ask you to sign it.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.004
Would you mind?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.476
Of course.

24:05.244 --> 24:07.079
Uh, what's your name again?

24:07.113 --> 24:08.748
-Julie.
-Julie.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.484
And could you write it
to hal, too?

24:11.518 --> 24:13.620
He was my husband.

24:13.653 --> 24:16.489
He watched you every day.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.958
He's gone now, but I know
this'll make him smile

24:18.991 --> 24:21.060
down from heaven.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.862
Thank you so much.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.163
You bet.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.798
Excuse me.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.779
So she didn't marry Jason
after all?

24:39.812 --> 24:42.114
No.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.249
That just broke my heart

24:43.282 --> 24:45.785
when I read about it.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.186
Is she okay?

24:49.656 --> 24:52.024
She's great. She's fine.

24:52.058 --> 24:56.495
Have you-- have you been friends
with her for a while?

24:57.697 --> 24:59.632
A while. Yeah.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.202
Can I just ask you. I--

25:03.235 --> 25:04.771
I won't tell anyone.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.974
I mean, it's gonna stay
right here between us.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.577
Has she moved on?
Is she seeing anyone new?

25:13.112 --> 25:15.682
She's definitely
seeing someone.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.150
Someone from the show?

25:20.086 --> 25:22.288
Uh, not-- no, not really.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.156
No, it's-- she's--

25:24.190 --> 25:25.592
no.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.829
Um, is it serious?

25:29.862 --> 25:31.798
Yeah. Yes.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.001
Can you tell me?

25:35.034 --> 25:37.169
I just want her to be happy.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.307
Well, yeah, she--

25:41.340 --> 25:44.110
you know, she's--
she's with me.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.919
Oh. I'm sorry. Oh.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.789
I don't-- um...

26:02.695 --> 26:04.363
Oh, gosh, I'm in your seat.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.599
I, um...

26:06.633 --> 26:07.967
Thank you for this.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.337
Yeah.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.240
[Sighs]

26:23.349 --> 26:24.617
[Man chuckles]

26:24.651 --> 26:25.818
-Hi.
-For you.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.687
Oh, thank you.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.988
-Hello.
-How are you?

26:29.021 --> 26:30.823
-Good.
-Good to see you.

26:30.857 --> 26:33.693
-Oh, my word, look how
beautiful this is. -Wow.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.728
It's beautiful. It's not
as beautiful as you two.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.396
-Come here.
-Do you wanna see outside?

26:37.429 --> 26:38.765
Yes, of course.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.869
So the writers came to me
with this idea. Right?

26:42.902 --> 26:44.804
Oh, they're bringing Todd Hayes
back. Did you know?

26:44.837 --> 26:47.373
N-no, I didn't. I--

26:47.406 --> 26:50.176
well, it's inspired,
if you think about it.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.679
We find out
that Todd's my son.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.080
[Chuckles]

26:54.113 --> 26:56.148
Oh, gosh,
i didn't see that coming.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.184
It makes sense,
you know, given our histories,

26:58.217 --> 27:01.320
because we know that Avery lied
to Zach about the baby, right?

27:01.353 --> 27:03.990
And then of course...

27:04.023 --> 27:07.694
Honey, Jason, really please.
Wow.

27:07.727 --> 27:11.263
I think Lainey's heard enough farfetched
baby antics to last a lifetime.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.765
Well, she had sex with Todd.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.100
Oh, god.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.268
For the first time,
i really understand

27:16.302 --> 27:18.838
why it's a little strange
to let this job consume you,

27:18.871 --> 27:20.840
'cause you don't know where

27:20.873 --> 27:23.409
you end
and the character begins.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.915
Well, then you're well on your way
to being normal again. Cheers.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.817
[Women laugh]

27:32.084 --> 27:34.053
Anyone want
anything else to drink?

27:34.086 --> 27:35.722
Would you like some coffee?

27:35.755 --> 27:37.089
Yeah, that'd be great.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.225
I'll get it.

27:42.428 --> 27:45.732
Well, this is a change of pace
from the Lainey I knew.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.433
Five days a week
and all those hours

27:47.466 --> 27:49.435
to a nice peaceful spot
like this.

27:49.468 --> 27:53.205
I don't know. A less hectic
life would never hurt anybody.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.151
Excuse me,
I'll be right back.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.919
Just one second.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.490
For the love of god, Jason,
read the room.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.792
What?

28:13.993 --> 28:15.061
[Sighs]

28:18.430 --> 28:20.099
[Muttering]

28:20.132 --> 28:22.334
You want me to say
you're having an early night?

28:22.368 --> 28:24.170
No.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.238
I think they'd understand.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.107
You know, maybe
we should just tell them.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.777
Tell them?

28:30.810 --> 28:35.347
I don't want a pity party. Jason? You
might as well send out a press release.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.449
What's happening to my life?

28:37.483 --> 28:40.152
I'm going to fade away, and you're
all just going to go on without me.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.488
I won't.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.490
Yes, honey, you will.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.236
I am so sorry.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.072
My husband-- bless his heart,
i love him to death,

29:00.106 --> 29:02.308
but he's got the emotional
sensitivity of a walnut.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.444
You know,
i knew there'd be a change.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.080
I just-- I didn't expect this.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.148
Is she okay?

29:09.181 --> 29:11.417
You know, sh--

29:11.450 --> 29:14.353
it's been hard since the move.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.122
And...

29:17.990 --> 29:20.026
-Eva?
-Sh--

29:21.293 --> 29:23.896
okay, whoa-whoa-whoa, Eva.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.832
If there's something
going on with Lainey,

29:25.865 --> 29:27.266
it's going on with you, too.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.968
And whether or not
she wants to talk about it,

29:29.001 --> 29:31.804
you might,
and you have a say.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.774
Honey, what's going on?

29:40.179 --> 29:43.215
There she is.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.985
I was just saying how great it
is with you guys here

29:46.018 --> 29:47.519
and my parents
further up the coast,

29:47.553 --> 29:49.088
and they're at that age.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.491
I'm going to be
driving by a lot.

29:52.524 --> 29:55.094
Well, thanks for coming by
and checking on your lady here.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.064
Absolutely.
One more time, give me a hug.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.366
-Oh, yeah.
-I miss you.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.168
Oh, miss you.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.103
Oh, man, it was a pleasure

30:04.136 --> 30:06.338
to love you and hate you
and fight with you

30:06.372 --> 30:08.007
for the last 20 years.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.242
And I'm glad to leave you
in this beautiful place

30:10.276 --> 30:12.011
with, of course,
this beautiful woman.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.146
-Give me a hug.
-Oh.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.382
She was a nightmare
before she met you.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.417
-I'm just saying.
-[Eva laughing]

30:20.486 --> 30:23.089
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.

30:23.122 --> 30:26.292
Thank you so much.
This was really lovely.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.860
-I'll see you soon.
-Okay.

30:27.894 --> 30:30.629
-Okay. Take me home.
-All right.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.398
Take me home.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.833
-Safe travels.
-[Val] Bye, everyone.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.306
You told her.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.063
Lainey, I'm sorry.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.299
I'm really sorry.

31:10.469 --> 31:14.040
I just needed
to talk to someone.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.284
I'm trying really hard

31:25.317 --> 31:27.586
to appreciate
every second with you.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.191
But I can't help it.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.026
You know, i-i--

31:34.060 --> 31:36.062
I can't help thinking about

31:36.095 --> 31:37.396
one day looking in your eyes

31:37.429 --> 31:40.332
and-- and you'll be gone.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.571
So how do we do that?

31:45.604 --> 31:47.539
How do we--

31:47.573 --> 31:49.541
how do we not live

31:49.575 --> 31:52.478
like we're just waiting
for you to disappear?

31:52.511 --> 31:54.080
I don't know,

31:54.113 --> 31:57.283
'cause it's exactly
what we're doing, right?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.085
-Where are you going?
-You know what? You're right.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.452
That's what this is.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.221
We both don't have to go
through that.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.290
You certainly don't have
to go through that.

32:04.323 --> 32:07.159
-Oh, my god. -I should just pack
my things while I still can.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.028
I should just tell you
not to feel guilty

32:09.061 --> 32:10.529
-while I still can.
-Don't do that.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.633
That is not what I want,

32:14.666 --> 32:16.602
but I need to tell how I feel,

32:16.635 --> 32:19.705
and I have to tell you
when it's hard.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.740
You don't think that I know
that this is hard?

32:21.773 --> 32:24.043
Of course you know.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.478
And you know I love you,
but I still tell you.

32:29.015 --> 32:31.283
I j-- i-- I am--

32:31.317 --> 32:33.019
I'm scared.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.622
What was your plan?

32:36.655 --> 32:39.992
To just never talk about this?

32:40.026 --> 32:43.295
About all of the things
that are going to happen?

32:43.329 --> 32:46.698
-Is that what you want?
-That's what I want.

32:46.732 --> 32:50.402
I want this thing
to swallow me up whole

32:50.436 --> 32:53.205
without discussing it
every 15 minutes

32:53.239 --> 32:55.541
and how it's going to feel
for both of us.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.652
That's good. Thank you.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.069
She has Alzheimer's.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.376
How do you know?

33:30.409 --> 33:32.811
Hal stopped being
able to write, too.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.780
He'd leave me note,

33:34.813 --> 33:36.515
and he'd think
it made perfect sense,

33:36.548 --> 33:38.650
but they weren't letters
anymore.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.421
And she left the "valley."

33:44.223 --> 33:45.757
She was Vivian.

33:45.791 --> 33:48.527
She never would've left
if she didn't have to.

34:00.139 --> 34:02.508
Well, this is familiar,
but I think you should be naked.

34:02.541 --> 34:05.377
So should you.

34:05.411 --> 34:06.845
I could handle
being banished from Eden

34:06.878 --> 34:08.313
if I was with you.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.382
That's because
we can handle anything.

34:10.416 --> 34:13.452
We wouldn't be any good
at populating the earth.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.088
Well, even if we could,

34:16.121 --> 34:17.389
half of them would be demented

34:17.422 --> 34:19.091
by the time they were 50.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.262
I'm sorry.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.097
I was being selfish.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.431
I don't want people to know,

34:26.465 --> 34:28.600
but maybe you need them
to know.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.502
Sometimes I think
it would just be easier

34:30.536 --> 34:32.438
if I took a little walk
out into the pacific.

34:32.471 --> 34:33.839
Don't say that.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.706
Put one of those big
red things in my pocket.

34:35.741 --> 34:39.610
No, honey, you need something
heavier than a pomegranate.

34:39.645 --> 34:43.215
See, you have to
want it to end.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.484
I don't want it to end.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.253
I would see
your beautiful face,

34:47.286 --> 34:48.719
and my legs
would just start kicking.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.456
[Chuckles]

34:50.489 --> 34:52.791
So here's the part where
i should tell you that

34:52.824 --> 34:54.760
when the time comes,
you should find someone

34:54.793 --> 34:57.196
to make you happy.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.765
But then you would know there was
something seriously wrong with me.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.134
Yeah.
No, I know what to do.

35:02.168 --> 35:05.304
Clutch a rosary and wear a black
veil for the rest of my life.

35:05.337 --> 35:09.475
The fewer people to see that
face, the better, thank you.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.910
There's just so much
i want to do.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.912
The time we have left

35:13.945 --> 35:15.614
can still mean something.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.149
That is so beautiful.

35:17.183 --> 35:18.850
Did you read that
in a greeting card?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.519
Yes, the Alzheimer's section
of the drugstore,

35:20.552 --> 35:22.221
-smartass.
-Oh.

35:22.254 --> 35:25.524
What I meant to say

35:25.557 --> 35:29.395
was that I have to believe
that you can still feel happy

35:29.428 --> 35:32.431
even if you don't
remember why.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.800
So we devote ourselves
to a happy now.

35:34.833 --> 35:38.570
A million of them.

35:38.604 --> 35:42.874
Okay, I've never had one
of those apples on a stick.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.610
Like a caramel apple?

35:44.643 --> 35:46.278
-Is that what they call them?
-Yeah.

35:46.312 --> 35:47.379
Yeah, i-- okay.

35:47.413 --> 35:48.480
Well, take it easy.

35:48.514 --> 35:49.615
I'm not a magician.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.383
What else?

35:51.417 --> 35:53.652
I think you should get
a tattoo of my face.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.187
-Right...
-About here.

35:55.221 --> 35:56.822
Yeah.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.791
I feel like I should explain
to you what a bucket list is.

35:59.825 --> 36:03.695
It is not a list of things
you make other people do.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.965
That doesn't seem right.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.268
Yeah.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.270
[Soft music playing]

36:14.606 --> 36:16.442
Okay. Here we go.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.377
A very small bite...

36:18.410 --> 36:19.845
[Laughing]

36:19.878 --> 36:21.580
Yeah.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.720
? it's been
a long time coming ?

36:28.754 --> 36:32.758
? I've been a long time
running from myself ?

36:32.791 --> 36:36.462
-[chattering]
-? those demons in my soul

36:36.495 --> 36:38.564
[squealing]

36:38.597 --> 36:41.567
? all I wanted was some time

36:41.600 --> 36:44.603
? to maybe change
your lonely mind ?

36:44.636 --> 36:49.241
? but there are things
that even I can't control ?

36:51.610 --> 36:57.316
? I never was the best
at moving on ?

36:57.349 --> 37:02.421
? all this time I've just been
trying to get along ?

37:04.055 --> 37:08.460
? keep my spirits strong

37:11.563 --> 37:14.433
? still I'm holding on
to you ?

37:18.837 --> 37:20.372
isn't it weird...

37:22.308 --> 37:23.542
That I will stop existing,

37:23.575 --> 37:25.977
and you'll still be here?

37:26.011 --> 37:29.014
And then tomorrow
will be tomorrow,

37:29.047 --> 37:31.717
but I'm not going to be in it.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.051
Was that downer?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.653
-Yeah, just...
-A little bit of a downer?

37:34.686 --> 37:36.755
Sorry about that.
All right, all right.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.056
-Then I have a question.
-Okay.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.725
How many people--

37:39.758 --> 37:43.962
and I need, like,
a firm number on this one--

37:43.995 --> 37:45.497
have looked up at those stars

37:45.531 --> 37:47.899
and contemplated
their existence?

37:47.933 --> 37:49.568
And now they're, like...

37:49.601 --> 37:50.569
[Makes sputtering sound]

37:50.602 --> 37:51.570
...dead and gone?

37:51.603 --> 37:52.971
Yeah, yeah.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.573
Just mull that over,
will you?

37:54.606 --> 37:56.041
No, it's five.

37:56.074 --> 37:58.310
Oh, you seem mighty sure
of yourself.

37:58.344 --> 38:02.381
It's five. Oh, actually i
might be low-balling that.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.950
It's maybe, like, seven.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.885
Seven people.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.355
You sound so sure.

38:09.388 --> 38:11.423
I'm positive.

38:11.457 --> 38:13.359
Good, you've checked out
my question.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.026
I'm smart.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.829
You don't know.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.097
I'm super smart,

38:19.130 --> 38:21.333
like, especially right now.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.701
Extra...

38:23.702 --> 38:25.337
[Chattering]

38:33.445 --> 38:35.080
It's not what I want,

38:35.113 --> 38:36.882
but everyone we've spoken to

38:36.915 --> 38:39.851
says we need to do this sooner
rather than later.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.388
It's not like you to be
so defeatist.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.359
You know, without this

38:47.393 --> 38:48.760
I am no one.

39:53.659 --> 39:54.993
Good morning.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.096
Coffee and a muffin.

39:58.129 --> 39:59.798
Give me a sec.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.900
Is it true that Lainey Allen
lives around here?

40:05.003 --> 40:07.205
I don't have
any coffee or muffins.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.441
You might do better
somewhere else.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.848
Great.
Maybe you will tomorrow.

40:25.791 --> 40:29.795
Oh, my lord.

40:32.598 --> 40:35.000
The truth
is better than this.

40:39.505 --> 40:40.672
Yes.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.912
Well, hal wouldn't
let me tell anyone

40:46.945 --> 40:48.747
for the first six months.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.783
It was his pride.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.652
I mean,
he was such a good person,

40:53.685 --> 40:54.886
and I think--

40:57.589 --> 41:01.627
I think you would've really
liked him before.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.896
And I know
he would've liked you.

56:29.019 --> 56:30.588
When the time comes,

56:30.621 --> 56:32.790
you don't need to--

56:32.823 --> 56:35.726
to do this all by yourself.

56:35.760 --> 56:38.729
You know, if you--

56:38.763 --> 56:40.130
we should pick a date.

56:40.164 --> 56:41.966
Let's pick a date,

56:41.999 --> 56:47.672
and that way you don't get
a say when it's too much.

56:50.675 --> 56:52.443
When I'm too much.

56:53.478 --> 56:55.446
Let's find a place,

56:55.480 --> 56:59.450
and on that day I'll go.

56:59.484 --> 57:03.554
No. I think we should wait
and we'll see--

57:03.588 --> 57:05.055
-we'll see how--
-no.

57:22.139 --> 57:25.610
Our special-care unit
is very secure.

57:25.643 --> 57:28.078
Only the staff members
have access codes.

57:28.112 --> 57:30.247
We're very careful here.

57:30.280 --> 57:33.217
In case one of them tries
to make a break for it?

57:33.250 --> 57:34.685
Uh...

57:35.886 --> 57:38.489
Is there some place outside

57:38.523 --> 57:40.591
for the inmates to go?

57:40.625 --> 57:42.026
In-habitants.

57:42.059 --> 57:43.661
Residents.

57:43.694 --> 57:47.164
Patients can request to be
taken out to the gardens

57:47.197 --> 57:49.900
at certain times of day
if they choose.

57:49.934 --> 57:51.101
We have lovely gardens.

57:51.135 --> 57:54.004
That's important-- fresh air.

57:54.038 --> 57:57.274
For mom, so she can shake
that winter pallor.

57:57.307 --> 58:00.611
We keep our patients
as comfortable as possible.

58:00.645 --> 58:04.615
We do try to keep medication
to a minimum

58:04.649 --> 58:06.517
unless absolutely necessary.

58:06.551 --> 58:08.886
Have you had trouble
with night wandering?

58:10.955 --> 58:12.590
-No.
-No.

58:12.623 --> 58:13.991
Well, it's very common.

58:14.024 --> 58:15.926
It'll likely develop.

58:15.960 --> 58:19.496
We recommend putting a bell
on the front door.

58:20.998 --> 58:24.001
Like a jingle bell?

58:24.034 --> 58:25.770
Well, why stop there?

58:25.803 --> 58:28.272
Why don't you just throw on
a cat collar or a cowbell?

58:28.305 --> 58:30.174
[Laughs]

58:30.207 --> 58:32.910
We do sedate
the night wanderers

58:32.943 --> 58:34.311
for their safety.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.781
Wow, that's just...

58:37.882 --> 58:39.650
Barbaric, really.

58:39.684 --> 58:40.951
It's-- it's...

58:40.985 --> 58:42.587
We're a barbaric country.

58:42.620 --> 58:45.990
No, i-- I do not
want to be sedated.

58:46.023 --> 58:49.259
Okay? I mean, just push me out
on a fucking ice floe.

58:49.293 --> 58:50.961
Okay?
That would be more humane.

58:50.995 --> 58:53.063
All right? Look at them
wandering around jabbering.

58:53.097 --> 58:55.299
Who wants to see a person
live like that?

58:55.332 --> 58:56.533
Who?

58:58.936 --> 59:01.839
Sorry. I tried.
I really did.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.274
-I know.
-What is with the smell?

59:04.308 --> 59:06.176
They all smell like cabbage.

59:09.880 --> 59:12.016
I-- because--
because you're fighting,

59:12.049 --> 59:14.151
and I haven't seen you fight
in so long,

59:14.184 --> 59:16.086
and there you were,

59:16.120 --> 59:18.355
just railing on that poor
woman that you just met

59:18.388 --> 59:19.957
and I'm happy.

59:19.990 --> 59:22.660
-Totally unreasonable.
-Totally unreasonable

Um, I'm mindy.

You know,
we were properly devastated

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:34.331
when they said
you were leaving.

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:36.000
Um, and I still think,

01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:37.401
you should've gone with him.

01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:39.804

use the b-word,

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:42.940
but she doesn't deserve him.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.409
She never will.

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:47.111
Oh!

How can I help you?

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:00.991
I would not have thought anything
could make that experience

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:02.693
any more uncomfortable.

This is the one.

sound so fucking pleasant?

Maybe.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:44.969
Mm, I don't like it.

impression is okay, at least.

a very good one.

Oh, my god.

where you put them.

always keep them in the door?

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.559
M-Mike.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:19.863
Where's your friend?

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.176
I have to go.

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.844
Slow down.

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:04.174
Wanna come inside?

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:05.675
Val, can you take her?

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:12.649
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:13.883
How did you find her?

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:15.452
Well, small town.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.354
You know, like I said,
everyone knows me.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:20.457
And I may have mentioned
when you first arrived

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.957
that we were friendly.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:27.197
So, Dan, when he thought
she might be in trouble...

01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:28.865
She is in trouble, Eva.

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:33.370
She could get hurt.

01:09:33.403 --> 01:09:35.439
You can't leave her alone.

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:37.974
And I understand you can't
possibly watch her

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.576
every minute of every day,

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:43.212
but we got lucky today.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:47.384
We might not next time.

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:49.353
Oh, come here.

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:52.421
I'm here for you.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.827
Thank you.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:14.344
-Vivian. -Were you
expecting someone else?

01:10:14.378 --> 01:10:17.314
I wanted to believe you had
changed. I really did.

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:18.782
When you came back to
the valley with your stories

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:20.617
about how things
were going to be different...

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:23.587
Vivian's about to kill Katy.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.589
You may have pulled the wool
over everyone else's eyes,

01:10:25.622 --> 01:10:26.823
but not mine.

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:28.492
You don't want
what's best for ed.

01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:30.527
You want what's best
for yourself.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.496
It would break him to know
that you were here.

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:34.364
-It really would.
-Are you going to tell him?

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:36.400
[Vivian] Give me one
reason why I shouldn't?

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:39.369
[Katy] Well, I don't see why
you'd want to hurt him that way.

01:10:39.403 --> 01:10:41.271
[Vivian]
Me?

01:10:41.305 --> 01:10:42.639
[Katy]
You said it yourself.

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:44.374
It would break him.

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:45.675
[Vivian] Then you should've
thought about that

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:46.810
before you came running back

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:48.044
when no one good and trusting

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.314
would fall
for your pathetic act.

01:10:50.347 --> 01:10:53.450
[Katy] I think we both
have secrets, Vivian.

01:10:53.483 --> 01:10:54.851
Oh, not like you.

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:57.053
I have more decency
in my worst mistakes

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.955
than you have
in your finest moments.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.590
I won't let you do this.

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:02.058
Oh, really?

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:04.928
-Get your hands off of me!
-Tell me about it!

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:10.467
There isn't a moment
that goes by

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.669
that I'm not grateful
to be loved by her.

01:11:14.438 --> 01:11:16.673
And I would give anything

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:19.576
to have infinite moments
like that with her.

01:11:21.845 --> 01:11:22.846
But because
that's not something

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:24.914
that I or medical science

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:27.517
apparently can figure out,

01:11:27.551 --> 01:11:30.420
I'm just going to
have to try to enjoy

01:11:30.454 --> 01:11:31.955
the time I do have with her...

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:36.326
In all its imperfect
perfectness.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:39.996
I love you.

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:28.678
You ready to go?

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:31.548
I-- um...

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:43.760
Shall I?

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:16.993
You're always beautiful.

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.130
[Chuckles]

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:55.465
Lainey?
Look who's here to see you.

01:14:01.004 --> 01:14:02.539
Hi.

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:18.555
Look.

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:25.028
These are the, um...

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:27.831
Lights.

01:14:27.864 --> 01:14:29.899
Um, this is, uh...

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:33.903
You feel like you can fly.

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:39.809
And this, um...

01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:41.511
It's the net.

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:48.184
And this is, um...

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:49.252
Um...

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:53.590
You won that.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:56.626
I did?

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:57.961
Yes, you did.

01:14:58.962 --> 01:15:00.730
And I was so proud of you.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.138
You're beautiful.

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:16.145
I'm sure you hear that
all the time,

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:18.281
but I'm-- I'm spoken for,

01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:20.617
so I...

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:22.752
Think it's okay if I say that.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:38.134
Will you come visit again?

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:41.170
Of course I will.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.082
[Music playing]

01:16:01.825 --> 01:16:04.027
? take my hand

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.030
? take me back in time

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:09.966
? to remember whens

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:13.069
? that I've left behind

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:16.039
? there's an endless haze

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:19.108
? of days to come

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:23.613
? and so far
I've been wasting mine ?

01:16:23.647 --> 01:16:26.249
? on wars that can't be won

01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:28.117
? take me home

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:30.954
? take me where you are

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:33.857
? 'cause the world
I've known ?

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:37.126
? has been getting dark

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.029
? can you ease the fear

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:43.166
? knocking at my door

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:47.671
? that when I wake,
my worst mistakes ?

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:51.340
? won't haunt me anymore

01:16:51.374 --> 01:16:54.343
? it's do or die

01:16:54.377 --> 01:16:59.115
? what little time we have

01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:06.189
? but stay awhile

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:10.860
? we'll try to make
this last ?

01:17:13.029 --> 01:17:15.799
? 'cause every second passed

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:18.367
? is just a chance

01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:21.938
? out of our reach

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:29.112
? so I'll keep living
in the moment ?

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:32.381
? till it's all
that's left of me ?

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.460
? take my love

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:47.363
? keep it safe somewhere

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:50.466
? when I lose myself

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.737
? you can find me there

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:56.439
? when I can't be strong

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:59.408
? will you still know

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:02.712
? the heart inside's
the heart ?

01:18:02.746 --> 01:18:06.249
? that I have called my own?

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:10.954
? it's do or die

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:15.258
? what little time we have

01:18:19.896 --> 01:18:22.899
? but stay awhile

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:27.804
? we'll try to make
this last ?

01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:34.878
? it's do or die

01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:39.382
? what little time we have

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.823
? but stay awhile
