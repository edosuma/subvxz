WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.372
We're here today

00:02.373 --> 00:05.105
to say thank you and farewell

00:05.106 --> 00:09.008
to those who've given
us the ultimate gift...

00:09.009 --> 00:11.010
Their bodies.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.213
For eight months,
we've opened them,

00:13.214 --> 00:16.786
examined and dissected them.

00:16.787 --> 00:19.119
So to the cadavers of the
gross anatomy 101 class,

00:19.120 --> 00:21.121
we say thank you.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.194
And before we commit
you to a crematory fire,

00:24.195 --> 00:26.596
a moment of silence.

00:26.597 --> 00:28.598
Thanks for everything, Seymour.

00:28.599 --> 00:29.800
(Opens zipper)

00:32.333 --> 00:33.463
(Gasps)

00:33.464 --> 00:35.465
Is there some final word

00:35.466 --> 00:38.168
you'd like to say to your
cadaver, miss Mason?

00:38.169 --> 00:40.039
Um, actually...

00:40.040 --> 00:42.143
This isn't my cadaver.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.120
(Megan) Lacey.

00:51.082 --> 00:52.552
Lace, are you awake yet?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.053
(Lacey laughing)

00:54.054 --> 00:55.625
You can't be serious.

00:55.626 --> 00:57.557
There's no way he would've
said that. (Girl) Yeah. (Laughs)

00:57.558 --> 00:59.259
You're not even dressed?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.760
Dad's head will fly off

01:00.761 --> 01:02.092
if I'm late the first
day you're in charge.

01:02.093 --> 01:03.593
School starts at 8:15, right?

01:03.594 --> 01:05.335
But mathletes is at 7:05.

01:05.336 --> 01:07.137
(Inhales deeply and sighs) Mona,
can your mom swing by and pick me up?

01:07.138 --> 01:08.838
I'll be outside in ten seconds.

01:08.839 --> 01:10.670
Oh. Sure. No prob.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.202
Are you wearing my lipstick?

01:12.203 --> 01:13.343
Ew. No.

01:13.344 --> 01:15.445
Germs aside, your stuff's
been tested on animals

01:15.446 --> 01:17.107
and probably contains coal tar.

01:17.108 --> 01:19.409
I only use the hypoallergenic
cruelty-free makeup.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.151
Fine.

01:21.152 --> 01:23.183
Gotta go. Love you, mom.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.186
(Morris) So is this a
mix-up or a murder?

01:26.187 --> 01:27.187
Murder. Mix-up.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.688
(Indistinct conversations)

01:28.689 --> 01:32.162
She's probably an accident
victim from the hospital wing

01:32.163 --> 01:33.523
sent to the wrong
section of the morgue.

01:33.524 --> 01:35.094
Well, then where's Seymour?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.127
Who's Seymour?
My original cadaver.

01:37.128 --> 01:39.829
If this is a mix-up,
then where's he?

01:39.830 --> 01:41.171
We have upwards
of two dozen bodies

01:41.172 --> 01:42.502
rotating through
at any given time.

01:42.503 --> 01:45.175
It's probably just
an honest mistake

01:45.176 --> 01:46.176
by an overworked orderly.

01:46.177 --> 01:48.238
Excuse me, dear.

01:48.239 --> 01:50.109
Actually, it's Dr. Dear.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.712
Uh, Dr. Megan hunt,
medical examiner,

01:52.713 --> 01:55.445
Dr. Cameron fischer,
anatomy teacher.

01:55.446 --> 01:56.446
And this is...

01:56.447 --> 01:58.788
Dora. Dora Mason. Wow. Hi.

01:58.789 --> 02:01.221
She's the one who, uh,
found the body, called it in.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.523
(Cameron) Despite my objection.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.395
If it isn't a
mix-up, which it is,

02:05.396 --> 02:07.727
then it's an ill-advised prank.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.400
I've tried to teach my students
respect for these bodies,

02:10.401 --> 02:12.302
but boys will be boys.

02:12.303 --> 02:14.304
Mm. Maybe that's
why it took a girl

02:14.305 --> 02:16.736
to catch what you missed.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.239
I missed nothing.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.770
The bruising and
lacerations to the upper torso

02:20.771 --> 02:23.273
are consistent with
automobile trauma.

02:23.274 --> 02:25.315
I see defensive wounds,

02:25.316 --> 02:26.546
from possibly
fending off a weapon.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.378
I see wounds from bracing
against a steering wheel

02:28.379 --> 02:29.749
on impact.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.151
But what don't you see,
Dr. Fischer? Look hard.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.324
I am not a pupil, Dr. Hunt.

02:34.325 --> 02:38.258
More's the pity, for
you and your students.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.390
Uh, excuse me. Sorry.

02:40.391 --> 02:42.832
Resuscitation-related marks.
That's... that's what I don't see.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.334
I don't see signs that anyone

02:44.335 --> 02:46.436
tried to save her.

02:46.437 --> 02:48.298
Exactly.

02:48.299 --> 02:50.340
(Police radio chatter)

02:50.341 --> 02:51.341
Hey.

02:51.342 --> 02:52.502
(Sam) Hey.

02:52.503 --> 02:54.904
Look, this girl's a
straight-up Jane Doe.

02:54.905 --> 02:56.175
Mm.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.407
And no records in this hospital

02:57.408 --> 02:58.778
of anyone fitting
her description.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.281
And from what I've seen
of security in this place,

03:01.282 --> 03:03.653
anyone could've slipped a
body in here with minimal effort.

03:03.654 --> 03:05.755
So what do you think,
murder or mix-up?

03:05.756 --> 03:09.359
I guess we'll know when
the battle of the big ego ends.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.490
Well, I think you're wrong.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.922
And you're entitled
to your opinion.

03:12.923 --> 03:15.926
(Indistinct conversations)

03:17.528 --> 03:18.828
So what's up?

03:18.829 --> 03:20.370
Is this gonna be
our body or what?

03:20.371 --> 03:22.272
Well, they're still
battling it out now,

03:22.273 --> 03:23.903
but knowing Megan,
I'd say, get ready.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.275
(Blows air)

03:25.276 --> 03:27.477
It has the makings of an
old-school horror movie,

03:27.478 --> 03:29.208
doesn't it?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.911
Murder at the med school morgue,

03:31.912 --> 03:34.244
a coven of killer nurses

03:34.245 --> 03:35.545
in the basement,

03:35.546 --> 03:37.547
virgin sacrifices on the roof.

03:37.548 --> 03:38.788
(Laughs) That's
quite an imagination.

03:38.789 --> 03:40.250
You should put that on paper.

03:40.251 --> 03:42.221
I'm more of a
lover than a writer.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.594
We're taking the body.

03:44.595 --> 03:47.297
Nice catch, young lady.

03:47.298 --> 03:49.299
Big deal. You figured out
some 20-year-old hottie

03:49.300 --> 03:51.301
wasn't your 80-year-old cadaver.

03:51.302 --> 03:52.932
It hardly makes you
Sherlock of the year.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.534
Actually, it kinda does.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.607
I would like to invite
you and your friends

03:57.608 --> 03:59.509
back to the m.E.'S office

03:59.510 --> 04:02.342
to see the inner
workings of a real autopsy.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.613
It might help fill in... Wow.

04:03.614 --> 04:05.375
The gaps in your education,

04:05.376 --> 04:08.348
and maybe you'll
even get extra credit.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.320
Oh, my gosh.

04:09.321 --> 04:10.551
Nice.

04:14.425 --> 04:17.357
This is my boss,
Dr. Curtis brumfield.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.430
He's here to collect your
confidentiality agreements

04:20.431 --> 04:21.991
and legal waivers.

04:21.992 --> 04:23.793
Boy, fix your clothes.

04:23.794 --> 04:25.795
Pull your mask down. Thank you.

04:25.796 --> 04:27.297
Thank you. Thank you.

04:27.298 --> 04:29.439
See those stools behind you?

04:29.440 --> 04:31.841
Stand on 'em. Go on.

04:31.842 --> 04:33.843
They'll help you see everything

04:33.844 --> 04:35.305
and touch nothin'.

04:35.306 --> 04:37.377
Fall off and break
your leg if you want to.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.810
You won't be suing today.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.813
Okay, the bodies that you
worked on in gross anatomy

04:43.814 --> 04:46.656
all died of natural causes.

04:46.657 --> 04:48.858
But this...

04:48.859 --> 04:51.462
Is the real world.

04:52.563 --> 04:54.694
Dr. Megan hunt

04:54.695 --> 04:56.726
performing the external exam

04:56.727 --> 04:58.468
for the benefit of our guests

04:58.469 --> 05:01.431
from the penn
hill medical school

05:01.432 --> 05:02.972
on one Jane Doe...

05:02.973 --> 05:04.934
Caucasian, approximately...

05:04.935 --> 05:07.437
20 years of age.

05:07.438 --> 05:09.479
Blunt force trauma
to the left flank

05:09.480 --> 05:12.442
and the upper left
abdominal quadrant.

05:12.443 --> 05:14.744
Her hands are...

05:14.745 --> 05:16.946
Both bruised,

05:16.947 --> 05:19.689
appear to be
defensive in nature.

05:19.690 --> 05:22.822
No rigor, so she's been
dead for over 24 hours.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.993
Let's roll her, please.

05:23.994 --> 05:25.095
Yes, doctor.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.831
She has a large
tattoo on her back.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.534
Looks like it's a dragonfly.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.005
Fixed lividity, no blanching.

05:36.006 --> 05:37.667
And a heck of a sunburn.

05:37.668 --> 05:38.938
(Snickers)

05:38.939 --> 05:41.441
You. What color's her hair?

05:41.442 --> 05:43.042
Uh, blonde.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.044
Wrong answer. Look
again. Look at her roots.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.377
Before she was blonde,
she was a redhead,

05:47.378 --> 05:48.878
before that, a brunette.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.119
Color of the eyes?

05:50.120 --> 05:51.350
(Both) Green.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.482
Wrong again.

05:52.483 --> 05:53.853
The correct answer is...

05:53.854 --> 05:54.854
Undetermined.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.056
Tache noire has occurred.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.889
Now does anybody know
what tache noire means? Oh.

05:59.890 --> 06:02.692
Um, if the eyes remain
open 24 hours after death,

06:02.693 --> 06:04.434
the sclera exposed
to air dries out,

06:04.435 --> 06:07.397
resulting in a black
band in the exposed zone.

06:07.398 --> 06:09.439
(Ethan) Excellent.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.040
The funny thing is,

06:11.041 --> 06:12.403
her eyes were green...

06:14.104 --> 06:17.046
24 hours ago.

06:17.047 --> 06:19.749
The question is,

06:19.750 --> 06:22.453
how did you two know that?

06:26.887 --> 06:30.821
(Fabric snaps)

06:37.468 --> 06:39.669
Matthews, Shane.

06:39.670 --> 06:42.872
Six infractions on
your campus record

06:42.873 --> 06:45.975
and two drunk and disorderlies
with the Metro police.

06:45.976 --> 06:47.877
Yeah, you left out the
time my mom spanked me

06:47.878 --> 06:49.439
for eating a cookie
before dinner.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.140
Yeah, well, I'll pencil that
in along with felony murder.

06:51.141 --> 06:52.612
Hey, I didn't kill anyone.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.514
Then how'd you know the girl?

06:54.515 --> 06:56.916
Didn't know her.
Didn't kill her.

06:56.917 --> 06:57.848
That's funny, because...

06:57.849 --> 06:59.719
Do me a favor.
If I ever get shot,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.721
and this meathead is my doctor,

07:01.722 --> 07:03.553
just let me bleed out, please.

07:03.554 --> 07:05.154
Don't worry. You
wouldn't survive anyway.

07:05.155 --> 07:07.798
Look at his hands.
He's all thumbs.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.131
Hardly surgeon material.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.906
That guy is the one to crack.

07:16.907 --> 07:18.538
His wingman.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.941
Yeah, that's just what
I'm gonna call him.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.172
(Opens door)

07:23.173 --> 07:24.844
Hey, wingman.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.716
I'm nobody's wingman, dude.

07:26.717 --> 07:27.877
Really?

07:27.878 --> 07:29.849
What do you call it

07:29.850 --> 07:32.822
when one guy hangs on
another guy's coat tails,

07:32.823 --> 07:35.054
one who's a little
better looking,

07:35.055 --> 07:36.886
a little smoother
with the ladies,

07:36.887 --> 07:39.058
and doesn't mind
handing down his leftovers?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.831
It's not... it's not
anything like that.

07:41.832 --> 07:43.793
I've looked at both your files.

07:43.794 --> 07:45.835
Birds of a feather
get in trouble together,

07:45.836 --> 07:49.769
except... yours has
a few more entries.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.100
Let me guess.

07:51.101 --> 07:53.172
Shane has an indiscretion,

07:53.173 --> 07:55.805
you take the rap for it?

07:55.806 --> 07:58.708
Maybe you and Shane

07:58.709 --> 08:00.750
tried to get rid of last
night's indiscretion

08:00.751 --> 08:02.552
when this one was
gonna call the cops.

08:02.553 --> 08:04.914
That's not it at all, man.

08:04.915 --> 08:06.656
Then what happened?
How do you know the girl?

08:06.657 --> 08:08.588
We didn't know her.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.819
We met her once,

08:09.820 --> 08:11.721
months ago, at
some bar off campus.

08:11.722 --> 08:14.924
Shane came on to
her, she shut him down,

08:14.925 --> 08:16.926
and then I tried and
got shut down harder.

08:16.927 --> 08:18.067
That piss you off?

08:18.068 --> 08:19.869
No, man. I don't bat a
thousand every night,

08:19.870 --> 08:20.831
so whatever.

08:20.832 --> 08:22.872
Look, I-I don't even
know her name.

08:22.873 --> 08:26.005
I just remember her
because of her tattoo.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.837
(Morris) You sure
you haven't seen her?

08:27.838 --> 08:29.138
She had a tattoo on her back.

08:29.139 --> 08:31.140
You know how many blondes
with tramp stamps come in here?

08:31.141 --> 08:33.212
I mean, I wish I could
help, but... (Chuckles)

08:33.213 --> 08:34.984
♪♪♪

08:34.985 --> 08:36.886
You know, why don't
you act like a human being

08:36.887 --> 08:38.517
and take a closer look?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.890
Hey, look, I said I
don't know the girl.

08:40.891 --> 08:42.592
This girl changed
her hair color a lot.

08:42.593 --> 08:44.023
And she didn't
have a tramp stamp.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.995
It was an incredible
tattoo of a dragonfly

08:45.996 --> 08:48.698
that went all the
way down her back.

08:48.699 --> 08:49.899
Okay.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.861
Yeah, that girl I know.

08:51.862 --> 08:53.763
Jackie something.

08:53.764 --> 08:55.735
She worked across the
street at the limo service.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.907
I haven't seen her
in about six months,

08:57.908 --> 08:59.809
but she used to come in
here after she'd close up.

08:59.810 --> 09:01.240
♪♪♪

09:01.241 --> 09:04.244
Well, I know where
we'll be in the morning.

09:06.016 --> 09:07.316
Hey, you.

09:07.317 --> 09:09.318
I thought I'd make us
hamburgers tonight.

09:09.319 --> 09:12.221
Uh, no, thanks,
mom. Meat is murder.

09:12.222 --> 09:14.153
I had a salad at Mona's.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.626
Everything in
your fridge is gross.

09:16.627 --> 09:18.027
Why do you think
I went shopping?

09:18.028 --> 09:19.288
Now I have an excuse to cook.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.631
Mona and Suzie will
be here in a few minuets

09:21.632 --> 09:23.633
to work on our project.

09:23.634 --> 09:24.964
They're coming here? Great.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.095
Then I can whip
us all up something.

09:26.096 --> 09:27.867
(Laptop chimes and beeps)

09:27.868 --> 09:29.940
No need. They're already here.

09:31.001 --> 09:32.602
Hey, guys.

09:32.603 --> 09:33.603
(Girls) Hi, Lacey.

09:33.604 --> 09:35.905
Okay. Let's go to my office.

09:35.906 --> 09:37.046
(Sighs)

09:37.047 --> 09:40.580
(Girls laughing
over computer chat)

09:43.053 --> 09:44.914
(Cell phone rings)

09:44.915 --> 09:50.359
(Ring)

09:50.360 --> 09:52.662
(Rings and beeps)

09:52.663 --> 09:54.123
Megan hunt.

09:54.124 --> 09:55.825
Dr. Hunt. Hi.

09:55.826 --> 09:57.767
Uh, it's dora.

09:57.768 --> 10:01.931
Um, listen, uh, I-I just
wanted to say thank you

10:01.932 --> 10:03.332
for being cool,

10:03.333 --> 10:05.174
for recognizing that Shane

10:05.175 --> 10:06.906
and Doug are morons,

10:06.907 --> 10:08.878
for... for being an inspiration.

10:08.879 --> 10:11.080
Gee. I didn't know
I was that great.

10:11.081 --> 10:13.242
Oh. Well, sorry.

10:13.243 --> 10:17.246
Mom always said I was an
overly expressive intuitive.

10:17.247 --> 10:19.388
Oh. Psychiatrist, huh?

10:19.389 --> 10:20.790
Was.

10:20.791 --> 10:22.121
If she were alive,
she would say,

10:22.122 --> 10:24.153
"dora, just say thank
you and leave it at that,"

10:24.154 --> 10:26.225
so... (Sighs)

10:26.226 --> 10:27.326
Thank you.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.199
You're very welcome.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.661
Um...

10:31.662 --> 10:35.004
You know, because of your
friends Shane and Doug,

10:35.005 --> 10:38.067
I was not able to do
the internal exam today.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.239
And it's scheduled first
thing in the morning.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.071
You want to observe?

10:42.072 --> 10:43.372
Really?

10:43.373 --> 10:44.373
Wow.

10:44.374 --> 10:45.775
Uh, yes. Yes, yes.

10:45.776 --> 10:48.718
Um... thank you. (Laughs)

10:48.719 --> 10:51.721
Okay, fine. I will
see you tomorrow.

10:51.722 --> 10:53.753
(Man) I can't believe it.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.985
She used to work for
us, about six months ago.

10:55.986 --> 10:58.257
But one day, she just quit.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.691
Her name was Jackie Johnson.

11:01.692 --> 11:05.034
Anything you can,
uh, tell us about her?

11:05.035 --> 11:06.265
She kept to herself.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.067
Nice girl, but quiet.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.299
Customers liked her
because she didn't talk.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.671
Oh, really, talking's a problem?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.173
Our customers prefer listeners.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.674
You wouldn't believe
some of the problems

11:15.675 --> 11:18.047
these people share
with our drivers.

11:18.048 --> 11:20.149
We call it limo therapy.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.181
Any customer
troubles in particular

11:22.182 --> 11:24.884
that she told either
one of you about?

11:24.885 --> 11:28.087
No. No, she had enough
real troubles of her own.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.219
She didn't talk about it
much but I got the sense

11:30.220 --> 11:32.161
that she was...

11:32.162 --> 11:34.363
I don't know, running
from somebody.

11:34.364 --> 11:35.364
Really?

11:35.365 --> 11:36.866
I have an address.

11:36.867 --> 11:38.868
It's a p.O. Box, I think.

11:38.869 --> 11:40.870
Great.

11:40.871 --> 11:43.733
(Indistinct conversations)

11:43.734 --> 11:45.234
You drink that slop?

11:45.235 --> 11:47.106
I make a mean Espresso.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.407
What do you got
against instant, huh?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.239
Let's just say, I like to grind.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.240
(Chuckles)

11:51.241 --> 11:52.441
What? I'm just sayin'.

11:52.442 --> 11:54.083
I think I know what
you're saying, Dani.

11:54.084 --> 11:55.045
Whew.

11:55.046 --> 11:57.086
'Cause my little double
entendre generator

11:57.087 --> 11:58.748
was almost out of gas.

11:58.749 --> 12:00.489
Okay, uh...

12:00.490 --> 12:02.491
I have to say no.

12:02.492 --> 12:04.323
No?

12:04.324 --> 12:06.155
Dating a coworker is a bad idea.

12:06.156 --> 12:08.858
Four good reasons why. Go.

12:08.859 --> 12:11.300
First it's hot, then
it gets messy,

12:11.301 --> 12:14.133
and then it ends, and
then it gets even messier.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.204
Too bad.

12:15.205 --> 12:17.237
Could've been fun.

12:18.769 --> 12:20.240
Hey, Dr. Murphy.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.142
Didn't come here to eavesdrop.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.144
I was on a cookie hunt.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.246
That's a cute girl.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.778
But you did the right thing.

12:28.779 --> 12:29.949
Take it from me,

12:29.950 --> 12:31.550
keep the personal
life out of the office.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.854
Dr. Megan hunt

12:34.855 --> 12:38.227
performing an autopsy
on Jackie Johnson

12:38.228 --> 12:41.531
with Dr. Dora Mason observing.

12:42.893 --> 12:45.134
(Footsteps approach)

12:45.135 --> 12:47.036
Oh, and here's my other boss,

12:47.037 --> 12:48.838
Dr. Kate Murphy.

12:48.839 --> 12:50.840
We're not in trouble, are we?

12:50.841 --> 12:52.101
On the contrary,

12:52.102 --> 12:53.542
it gets to be a bit of a
boys' club around here,

12:53.543 --> 12:55.144
so this is nice to
see for a change.

12:55.145 --> 12:58.177
You're from, uh, the
med school, right?

12:58.178 --> 13:00.249
I know your
anatomy instructor...

13:00.250 --> 13:01.510
Fischer.

13:01.511 --> 13:04.984
He can be a bit
intense with the ladies.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.115
(Dora) If you're his type.

13:06.116 --> 13:08.217
If you're me, he
doesn't know you exist.

13:08.218 --> 13:09.959
Frankly, I don't
know which is worse.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.290
Ew.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.461
What's that, uh, grape smell?

13:12.462 --> 13:14.223
That's some kind of infection.

13:14.224 --> 13:17.496
I'm gonna have to suction the
blood out to find out. (Gurgling)

13:17.497 --> 13:19.428
We'll get Ethan to take

13:19.429 --> 13:22.231
a sample to the
lab for a gram stain.

13:22.232 --> 13:23.572
(Gurgling continues)

13:23.573 --> 13:26.005
Oh, check out that uterus.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.437
It's lumpy and enlarged.

13:28.438 --> 13:30.139
Diagnosis, doctor?

13:30.140 --> 13:31.881
Uh, fibroids?

13:31.882 --> 13:33.183
A leiomyoma, maybe?

13:34.544 --> 13:37.016
Wow. She's so pretty.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.118
Why would someone do this?

13:39.119 --> 13:41.490
Dr. Murphy likes us
to find out the how first.

13:41.491 --> 13:43.192
And here we go.

13:43.193 --> 13:44.854
Likely cause of death...

13:44.855 --> 13:46.295
Blunt force trauma

13:46.296 --> 13:48.127
with lacerations to the spleen.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.828
That's a horrible, painful way

13:49.829 --> 13:51.500
for a young girl to die.

13:51.501 --> 13:52.501
You okay?

13:52.502 --> 13:54.163
Yeah.

13:54.164 --> 13:56.835
Detective, we started
on Jackie without you.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.836
That isn't Jackie.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.909
Jackie Johnson is a fake name.

13:59.910 --> 14:02.011
Tried to find her
social security records,

14:02.012 --> 14:03.212
turns out, she doesn't have any.

14:03.213 --> 14:05.945
The limo service was
paying her under the table.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.346
All right, so who is she, then?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.847
Well, that's the
question of the hour.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.950
I tracked her address
down through a p.O. Box.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.181
Bud and I are
about to check it out.

14:12.182 --> 14:13.583
Do you want to come? Yes.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.385
Can you finish up for me?

14:16.386 --> 14:17.556
Of course.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.928
I'll meet you in the lobby.

14:18.929 --> 14:20.029
You stay in the break
room till I get back.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.090
Oh, but can I stay here?

14:21.091 --> 14:23.262
No. I'm responsible for you.

14:23.263 --> 14:26.036
And do not touch anything.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.444
(Creaks)

14:52.162 --> 14:53.562
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

14:53.563 --> 14:54.924
(Footsteps approach)

14:54.925 --> 14:56.395
Yes?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.297
May I help you?

14:58.298 --> 15:00.369
(People speaking indistinctly)

15:00.370 --> 15:01.971
Kate.

15:01.972 --> 15:02.972
(Clicks pen)

15:02.973 --> 15:05.004
My star pupil.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.036
Still smart, still sexy,

15:07.037 --> 15:10.009
and now running the
show. I'm proud of you.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.440
It's not a reunion, cam. Okay.

15:11.441 --> 15:12.541
What is it, then?

15:12.542 --> 15:14.343
(Scoffs)

15:14.344 --> 15:16.915
When I was in this very room,

15:16.916 --> 15:19.448
I remember...

15:19.449 --> 15:23.092
All too well that
you had a type.

15:23.093 --> 15:25.094
I was your type.

15:25.095 --> 15:26.255
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

15:26.256 --> 15:28.197
And you crossed a line.

15:28.198 --> 15:30.059
And you've been holding that in

15:30.060 --> 15:32.401
for 16 years?

15:32.402 --> 15:34.303
I have a girl on a slab...

15:34.304 --> 15:36.605
A pretty blonde girl...

15:36.606 --> 15:40.409
A girl that you swear ended
up in your morgue by mistake.

15:40.410 --> 15:42.341
She's your type, too.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.614
So I came here to
ask you one question.

15:45.675 --> 15:48.018
Did you kill her?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.357
I'm flattered you
think I'm still capable

15:58.358 --> 16:00.329
of wooing a girl that age.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.231
Don't be. I also think
you could've killed her.

16:02.232 --> 16:04.393
You've got access to
this place at all hours.

16:04.394 --> 16:07.136
And... I like blondes?

16:07.137 --> 16:09.468
(Laughs) Come on, Kate.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.971
I'd put her time
of death at what,

16:12.972 --> 16:15.504
Tuesday night between
8:00 and 12:00?

16:15.505 --> 16:17.076
Sorry to disappoint you,

16:17.077 --> 16:18.607
but I have an
alibi for that night.

16:18.608 --> 16:19.978
Let me guess. A woman.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.053
Three, actually.

16:26.016 --> 16:27.986
These ladies and I

16:27.987 --> 16:30.319
were in Chicago Tuesday,

16:30.320 --> 16:34.093
presenting a panel on...

16:34.094 --> 16:36.595
Degenerative changes
to the metatarsal

16:36.596 --> 16:39.229
in women over 50.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.032
(Indistinct conversations)

16:43.033 --> 16:44.033
Well, thank you.

16:44.034 --> 16:46.135
(Siren whoops)

16:46.136 --> 16:48.677
Landlord said she'd
been here for six months,

16:48.678 --> 16:51.009
since she left the limo service.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.382
Looks like she was getting
ready to flee here, too.

16:53.383 --> 16:56.215
Maybe whomever she was
running from caught up with her.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.446
Mm-hmm.

16:57.447 --> 16:58.617
You know, she has a
whole house to herself.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.788
She quit her job.

16:59.789 --> 17:01.120
How could she afford this?

17:01.121 --> 17:03.692
What we need now is a real I.D.

17:03.693 --> 17:05.194
Do those things
have a name on them?

17:05.195 --> 17:07.126
No, labels removed.
Found 'em under the sink.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.258
They look like
generic antibiotics.

17:09.259 --> 17:11.360
(Sighs) You find something?

17:11.361 --> 17:13.062
Yeah. C.S.U.'S recovered
several small hairs

17:13.063 --> 17:14.203
around the kitchen area.

17:14.204 --> 17:15.534
Could be Jackie's.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.705
Could be the killer's.

17:16.706 --> 17:19.238
Get 'em all to the
lab, please. Sure.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.140
(Dani) What is it?

17:21.141 --> 17:24.173
Uh, it's... it's a slide
from our mystery girl...

17:24.174 --> 17:25.714
(Dramatic voice) From
the med school morgue.

17:25.715 --> 17:27.116
Mm-hmm. (Normal voice) Yeah.

17:27.117 --> 17:28.277
From the smell,

17:28.278 --> 17:31.280
I think it's a waterborne
pseudomonas infection.

17:31.281 --> 17:32.581
Huh?

17:32.582 --> 17:34.553
But she wasn't found in water.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.054
Aha. Our mystery deepens.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.756
Indeed, it deepens.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.658
Hey, so...

17:39.659 --> 17:41.230
I was waiting on
Dr. Hunt to come back,

17:41.231 --> 17:43.332
but obviously, she
forgot about me.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.564
But I was hoping
that I could get

17:45.565 --> 17:47.096
one last look at
that body I found.

17:47.097 --> 17:49.138
I know that that sounds
really weird. (Dani) Trust me.

17:49.139 --> 17:51.840
This is the one place where
that doesn't even approach weird.

17:51.841 --> 17:54.143
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

17:54.144 --> 17:55.374
I can't. Dr. Hunt would kill me.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.377
Come on. What are
you, a man or a mouse?

17:58.378 --> 18:00.649
Let the girl see the body.

18:00.650 --> 18:02.611
Catch you later, doc.

18:02.612 --> 18:04.783
Catch you... later.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.155
Please.

18:06.156 --> 18:07.156
Huh?

18:07.157 --> 18:08.187
I have a theory.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.119
Oh, god.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.120
Okay, look, the more
that I think about it,

18:11.121 --> 18:13.422
the more that I think
that my classmate Shane

18:13.423 --> 18:16.125
may have had
something to do with this.

18:16.126 --> 18:17.796
This is weird.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.199
I mean, there are
no signs of slippage,

18:20.200 --> 18:22.231
but there's all
this discoloration.

18:22.232 --> 18:25.103
Megan must have
missed this in her report.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.435
They look green.

18:26.436 --> 18:28.638
Yeah, they do. What is that?

18:30.840 --> 18:32.741
What are you doing?

18:32.742 --> 18:34.583
I thought I told you to
wait in the break room

18:34.584 --> 18:36.215
and touch nothing.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.216
Oh, she didn't touch... And you.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.387
Much.

18:38.388 --> 18:39.888
When did you think
this was a good idea?

18:39.889 --> 18:41.450
We found something
wrong in the left axilla...

18:41.451 --> 18:43.422
Do you realize that if you
allow her to touch the body,

18:43.423 --> 18:46.225
you compromise our findings?

18:46.226 --> 18:47.126
But listen, I think
Shane... No, no, I didn't...

18:47.127 --> 18:49.398
This is not a school project.

18:49.399 --> 18:51.300
This is a human being.

18:51.301 --> 18:53.862
You mess up in class,
you get a "b" minus.

18:53.863 --> 18:56.605
You mess up in
here, a killer goes free.

18:56.606 --> 18:58.136
Right.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.471
(People speaking indistinctly)

19:06.376 --> 19:08.718
Get back up on that stool.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.186
If you knew what you were doing,

19:17.187 --> 19:20.290
you'd know it was
her lymph node.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.385
Ah.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.317
It's green tattoo ink.

19:48.318 --> 19:50.619
Tattoo ink?

19:50.620 --> 19:53.262
(Mouths word)

19:53.263 --> 19:55.264
A lymph node

19:55.265 --> 19:57.496
can be a trap for
foreign particles.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.698
It's not unusual to
find tattoo ink in it.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.330
However,

20:01.331 --> 20:03.673
what's strange is the color.

20:06.876 --> 20:08.277
Let's flip the body.

20:08.278 --> 20:10.409
Yep.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.911
I don't see any green.
Her tattoos are black.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.283
Give me the a.L.S.

20:14.284 --> 20:15.645
Here you go.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.552
That looks like a Celtic knot.

20:23.553 --> 20:25.424
There's some kind of name.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.525
Ronan?

20:26.526 --> 20:27.896
Oh, yeah, Ronan.

20:27.897 --> 20:29.728
They're a-a local
Irish rock band.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.700
That's their logo. Wow.

20:31.701 --> 20:33.432
She must be a
hard-core fan. Shh.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.903
Ooh. Do you guys
think that maybe

20:34.904 --> 20:36.405
it has something to do
with... You know what I think?

20:36.406 --> 20:38.707
I think it's time for you to go.

20:38.708 --> 20:39.908
And you can show her out.

20:39.909 --> 20:41.871
Okay.

20:42.912 --> 20:44.544
(Whispers) Let's go. Let's go.

20:47.417 --> 20:48.647
Hey. (Girl) Hi, Lacey.
Are you logged on?

20:48.648 --> 20:49.648
Yeah, I'm gonna log
on. Hold on one second.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.919
Lacey, hurry up.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.020
I'm messaging her.
I'm trying, okay?

20:52.021 --> 20:53.382
Okay. What's taking so long?

20:53.383 --> 20:54.723
Seriously.

20:54.724 --> 20:56.325
(Laughs) I'm a slow typer.

20:56.326 --> 20:57.956
I thought the history test
today wassohard. Crazy.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.628
Yeah, I thought so, too.

20:59.629 --> 21:01.460
(Clicking keyboard keys)

21:01.461 --> 21:03.492
I know.

21:03.493 --> 21:05.294
Mom. Tomorrow night,

21:05.295 --> 21:06.635
you, me, dinner.

21:06.636 --> 21:10.769
No cell phones, no laptops,
no webcams, just family.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.771
They can still hear you.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.703
I don't care. Give
me your answer.

21:14.704 --> 21:17.376
Fine. Just... tomorrow
night. Just family.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.449
Hi, girls.

21:20.450 --> 21:22.351
I'm sorry.

21:22.352 --> 21:25.915
(Rock music playing)

21:27.417 --> 21:29.017
(Music stops)

21:29.018 --> 21:30.359
Yeah.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.661
Ronan Gallagher?

21:35.365 --> 21:38.398
(Irish accent) Her
name's Jackie o'shay.

21:40.430 --> 21:43.732
Who was she, your
number one fan?

21:43.733 --> 21:46.535
You could say that. We've...

21:46.536 --> 21:48.937
Been together
on and off since...

21:48.938 --> 21:50.779
We were 16.

21:50.780 --> 21:52.541
Childhood sweethearts.

21:52.542 --> 21:54.783
Jackie may have stayed
sweet, but you sure didn't.

21:54.784 --> 21:56.445
I've seen your record.

21:56.446 --> 21:58.617
It's as far from
sweet as it gets.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.590
Grew up among some bad people.

22:01.591 --> 22:04.053
You stay long enough,
it rubs off on you.

22:05.395 --> 22:06.855
Jackie didn't want
to be around it,

22:06.856 --> 22:08.397
so one day, she left.

22:08.398 --> 22:10.359
When was the last
time you talked to her?

22:10.360 --> 22:11.660
About a year ago now.

22:11.661 --> 22:13.762
Why'd she go so far
as to change her name,

22:13.763 --> 22:15.664
erase yours?

22:15.665 --> 22:17.366
Look, maybe you
can't understand this,

22:17.367 --> 22:18.837
but Jackie wasn't
running away from me.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.669
She was running
away from her old life,

22:20.670 --> 22:22.641
from people who didn't think
she could be anything more

22:22.642 --> 22:23.842
than what she was.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.374
Well, I can understand that.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.776
She wanted to go where
she could start fresh.

22:27.777 --> 22:30.779
What about you?
Did you try to follow?

22:30.780 --> 22:31.780
Yeah, I got cleaned up.

22:31.781 --> 22:33.452
It took me almost a year.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.524
Tried to find her, and...

22:35.525 --> 22:36.785
Show her how much I'd changed,

22:36.786 --> 22:39.788
but it's like she dropped
off the face of the earth.

22:39.789 --> 22:41.490
I've left messages
for her everywhere,

22:41.491 --> 22:43.433
everywhere I could think of.

22:45.034 --> 22:47.035
I guess she never got them.

22:47.036 --> 22:48.537
Or she did,

22:48.538 --> 22:51.400
and it was her clue to
pick up and run again.

22:51.401 --> 22:53.142
Maybe so.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.405
But either way...

22:56.406 --> 22:58.707
I never saw her.

22:58.708 --> 23:01.710
And now the best
thing in my life is gone

23:01.711 --> 23:04.713
for good.

23:04.714 --> 23:08.116
I can tell, you
believe this guy.

23:08.117 --> 23:10.388
Well, my gut says, yeah.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.822
(Chuckles) Why is it all this
emo, bad-boy rocker stuff

23:13.823 --> 23:15.494
works on you women?

23:15.495 --> 23:17.726
Wait a minute. I'm not
saying he didn't kill the girl.

23:17.727 --> 23:19.528
I'm just sayin', he loved her.

23:19.529 --> 23:20.729
Oh.

23:20.730 --> 23:22.531
Now let's go check his alibi.

23:22.532 --> 23:24.503
(Elevator bell dings)

23:24.504 --> 23:27.507
(People speaking indistinctly)

23:29.038 --> 23:32.410
(Doors close)

23:32.411 --> 23:34.943
No hard feelings, huh?

23:34.944 --> 23:36.585
About what?

23:36.586 --> 23:39.548
Our conversation yesterday.

23:39.549 --> 23:41.990
Consider it forgotten, dude.

23:41.991 --> 23:43.592
(Sighs)

23:43.593 --> 23:45.494
(Cell phone rings)

23:45.495 --> 23:47.696
(Ring)

23:47.697 --> 23:49.698
Call me or mom again,

23:49.699 --> 23:52.802
and you'll be picking up
your teeth with broken fingers.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.535
Uh...

23:56.536 --> 23:58.537
Who was that?

23:58.538 --> 23:59.509
(Sighs)

23:59.510 --> 24:01.440
My dad.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.645
I don't talk to
anyone like that,

24:06.646 --> 24:08.617
just so you know.

24:08.618 --> 24:10.118
Just him.

24:10.119 --> 24:12.551
He left when I was 5,

24:12.552 --> 24:15.754
crapped all over my mom,
and then he found god.

24:15.755 --> 24:19.688
Just 'cause god forgave
him doesn't mean we have to.

24:19.689 --> 24:23.632
(Chuckles) Which means
I'm pretty much going to hell,

24:23.633 --> 24:25.595
as far as my dad is concerned.

24:27.136 --> 24:29.768
That sounds like a
bad situation. I'm sorry.

24:29.769 --> 24:30.769
(Ding)

24:30.770 --> 24:32.771
(Doors open)

24:32.772 --> 24:35.043
Catch you later.

24:35.044 --> 24:36.474
(Sighs)

24:36.475 --> 24:38.106
So where's your protege?

24:38.107 --> 24:39.908
She broke the rules.

24:39.909 --> 24:42.581
Oh, so she did learn something
from you while she was here.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.253
(Singsongy) At least
I answer my phone.

24:45.254 --> 24:46.585
Oh, sorry.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.486
I went to see dora's
gross anatomy professor

24:48.487 --> 24:51.089
to see if he knew more
than he was letting on.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.861
(Normal voice) By yourself,

24:52.862 --> 24:54.763
without police backup?

24:54.764 --> 24:56.995
Wow.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.569
I guess someone else
istaking lessons from me.

25:00.570 --> 25:01.531
Okay.

25:01.532 --> 25:02.532
Look at this.

25:02.533 --> 25:03.802
What is it?

25:03.803 --> 25:06.004
It's a slide from
Jackie's uterus.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.505
The leiomyoma looks benign,

25:07.506 --> 25:09.177
but it's inflamed as hell.

25:09.178 --> 25:11.580
Yeah, but remember how
misshapen Jackie's uterus was?

25:11.581 --> 25:14.613
It wasn't the leiomyoma
that caused it.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.845
It was diffusely
infected. It's weird.

25:16.846 --> 25:18.617
(Curtis) I got your
weird right here.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.549
Some of that hair is Jackie's.

25:20.550 --> 25:22.050
Some of it is half Jackie's.

25:22.051 --> 25:23.653
Could it be
parents or a sibling?

25:25.224 --> 25:27.596
Or a baby.

25:27.597 --> 25:29.558
Oh.

25:29.559 --> 25:31.059
Her uterine infection was hiding

25:31.060 --> 25:33.531
all the normal
postpartum identifiers.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.534
She could have given
birth four to six weeks ago.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.708
Well, then where the
hell is Jackie's baby?

25:46.946 --> 25:48.216
Can you please tell
me how you all missed

25:48.217 --> 25:49.648
that this girl had a baby?

25:49.649 --> 25:50.949
She was 22 years old.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.822
The body can bounce
back after four to six weeks,

25:53.823 --> 25:55.624
except for the uterus,

25:55.625 --> 25:57.726
and her other
conditions masked it.

25:57.727 --> 25:59.958
Her nearest neighbors
were two doors down,

25:59.959 --> 26:02.130
and they didn't
see or hear a baby.

26:02.131 --> 26:03.792
And there's no record
of her giving birth

26:03.793 --> 26:05.994
in a hospital under either name.

26:05.995 --> 26:08.266
So she had a baby
completely off the grid?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.638
(Megan) Wait a minute.

26:09.639 --> 26:11.239
Jackie had a
pseudomonas infection.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.771
It's usually contracted in water

26:12.772 --> 26:15.073
and often occurs
in water births.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.605
So maybe

26:16.606 --> 26:19.948
Jackie gave birth at home
with the help of a midwife?

26:19.949 --> 26:22.350
If she wanted to stay off
grid, it'd be the way to go.

26:22.351 --> 26:23.752
Give birth at home,

26:23.753 --> 26:25.714
and a midwife doesn't
have to file a birth certificate

26:25.715 --> 26:27.816
for five days.

26:27.817 --> 26:30.288
My wife has
looked into allof this.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.821
Okay, I'll comb
the midwife registry.

26:32.822 --> 26:33.992
I should be able
to narrow it down.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.323
And Curtis is
working on isolating

26:35.324 --> 26:36.695
the possible murder weapon.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.697
And I will get the lab
to do a d.N.A. Profile

26:38.698 --> 26:40.729
on the baby's father.

26:40.730 --> 26:43.001
Right now, we have to assume
that whoever killed the mother

26:43.002 --> 26:44.332
snatched the child.

26:44.333 --> 26:47.736
So if we find the
killer, we find the baby.

26:47.737 --> 26:50.038
Yes, I met with Jackie
in her last trimester

26:50.039 --> 26:51.740
until after the birth.

26:51.741 --> 26:52.981
Was it a difficult birth?

26:52.982 --> 26:54.643
18 hours.

26:54.644 --> 26:55.384
When did you last
speak with her?

26:55.385 --> 26:57.085
About six weeks ago.
The baby was colicky,

26:57.086 --> 26:59.617
so I dropped by with
one of my tinctures.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.289
That helps with colic?

27:01.290 --> 27:02.620
And what is in that?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.622
My special mixture of chamomile,

27:04.623 --> 27:05.694
licorice, and menthol.

27:05.695 --> 27:08.056
Two drops on baby's
tongue, twice a day.

27:08.057 --> 27:10.158
I gave Jackie enough to
last a couple of months.

27:10.159 --> 27:11.960
Told her to show
the adoptive parents,

27:11.961 --> 27:14.062
or at least her broker,
how and when to apply it.

27:14.063 --> 27:16.064
She was giving the
baby up for adoption?

27:16.065 --> 27:17.766
She'd planned to,

27:17.767 --> 27:19.738
but you should've seen her
when she looked at her baby.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.040
She was having
second thoughts. Here.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.743
I took a picture.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.316
Do you happen to remember
the name of the agency?

27:28.317 --> 27:31.720
She never said.

27:31.721 --> 27:32.851
(Telephone receiver clatters)

27:32.852 --> 27:34.152
(Sam) I've talked to

27:34.153 --> 27:35.954
every adoption agency
in the Philadelphia area.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.856
They all say the same thing...

27:37.857 --> 27:41.329
Any prospective donor has to
go through prenatal screening.

27:41.330 --> 27:42.330
And Jackie didn't.

27:42.331 --> 27:44.332
No. This birth was off the grid,

27:44.333 --> 27:46.935
and I'm telling you, that
adoption wasn't legal.

27:46.936 --> 27:48.797
What are those?

27:48.798 --> 27:51.339
Unis canvassed the area
around Jackie's house

27:51.340 --> 27:53.742
for possible murder weapons.

27:53.743 --> 27:54.973
These are just from
the first square block.

27:54.974 --> 27:55.974
(Cell phone rings)

27:55.975 --> 27:57.806
Oh. (Beeps)

27:57.807 --> 27:59.107
Morris.

27:59.108 --> 28:01.680
Oh, hello, Dr. Brumfield.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.985
Elongated, wooden, and black?

28:06.986 --> 28:08.818
Hold on.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.163
I got a baseball bat
matching that description.

28:15.164 --> 28:16.164
(Door opens)

28:16.165 --> 28:17.465
No, bud, I'm home.

28:17.466 --> 28:20.128
Ethan is at the office waiting
on the weapon's analysis

28:20.129 --> 28:21.699
from the crime lab.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.972
He will stay there
all night if he has to.

28:23.973 --> 28:26.074
Okay. All right. Bye.

28:26.075 --> 28:29.277
(Laughter and
indistinct talking)

28:29.278 --> 28:32.440
I thought we said no computers.

28:32.441 --> 28:34.913
But you did say just family,

28:34.914 --> 28:36.745
and grandma's family.

28:36.746 --> 28:38.416
Hello, mother.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.988
Sounds like you
two are having fun.

28:39.989 --> 28:41.249
What am I missing?

28:41.250 --> 28:43.251
Oh, I was just telling
Lacey about living with you

28:43.252 --> 28:44.853
when you were her age.

28:44.854 --> 28:47.095
(Chuckles) Great.

28:47.096 --> 28:48.797
Did you know that your mother
used to bring home dead birds

28:48.798 --> 28:51.129
and keep them in the
freezer to study them?

28:51.130 --> 28:52.861
Ew. That's disgusting.

28:52.862 --> 28:54.302
Mom...

28:54.303 --> 28:55.503
I didn't know whether
she'd end up being a doctor

28:55.504 --> 28:56.805
or a serial killer. (Laughs)

28:56.806 --> 28:59.037
The jury was out
there for a while.

28:59.038 --> 29:00.038
(Lacey laughing)

29:00.039 --> 29:01.039
(Chuckles)

29:01.040 --> 29:03.341
(Cell phone rings)

29:03.342 --> 29:05.343
(Ring)

29:05.344 --> 29:07.275
(Beeps)

29:07.276 --> 29:08.446
(Dora) Oh, please don't

29:08.447 --> 29:09.477
hang up on me, Dr. Hunt.

29:09.478 --> 29:10.849
Okay, uh, I found

29:10.850 --> 29:12.280
my original cadaver Seymour.

29:12.281 --> 29:14.152
Good for you. Better yet,

29:14.153 --> 29:16.354
good for Seymour, but I
really have to go. (Laughs)

29:16.355 --> 29:17.986
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:17.987 --> 29:19.327
Listen...

29:19.328 --> 29:21.860
I think that I might
have found something.

29:21.861 --> 29:24.793
(Zipper opens)

29:24.794 --> 29:26.764
(Sighs) Meet Seymour.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.037
I was so focused on the murder,

29:29.038 --> 29:30.498
that I forgot about him.

29:30.499 --> 29:32.340
Where'd you find Seymour?

29:32.341 --> 29:33.842
Hospital morgue.

29:33.843 --> 29:35.844
I mean, eventually, they
would've realized the mistake,

29:35.845 --> 29:37.275
but that could've taken months.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.847
So what did you want to show me?

29:38.848 --> 29:41.509
Okay, well, when I
prepped him for cremation,

29:41.510 --> 29:45.513
I tied the extremities
in a simple granny knot.

29:45.514 --> 29:47.986
That... That is not my knot.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.918
It's a nice sailor knot.

29:49.919 --> 29:52.861
Okay. Check this out.

29:52.862 --> 29:54.864
(Opens zipper)

29:56.165 --> 29:58.897
Huh. Whose cadaver is this?

29:58.898 --> 29:59.928
My classmate,

29:59.929 --> 30:01.470
Shane Matthews.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.082
I met that girl once.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.914
I didn't sleep with her, I
didn't get her pregnant,

30:15.915 --> 30:17.315
and I didn't kill her.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.387
But we know you
switched the bodies.

30:19.388 --> 30:21.489
We found your d.N.A.
On the ropes used

30:21.490 --> 30:23.591
to tie up your
classmate's cadaver.

30:23.592 --> 30:26.194
Dora probably planted it.
She's always had it out for me.

30:26.195 --> 30:28.326
Or she's always had
your number. Whatever.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.398
I have an alibi. Yeah.

30:30.399 --> 30:31.930
That's right.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.131
Ten people know where I
was and what I was doing

30:33.132 --> 30:34.363
when that girl died.

30:36.605 --> 30:39.608
(Indistinct conversations)

30:43.572 --> 30:45.313
Why is he leaving?

30:45.314 --> 30:46.444
He alibied out.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.576
Witnesses put him
at the school library

30:48.577 --> 30:50.248
until after Jackie's
time of death.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.180
My gut says, he's the killer.

30:52.181 --> 30:53.621
But the facts say...
(Cell phone rings)

30:53.622 --> 30:54.622
He can't be.

30:54.623 --> 30:56.284
Morris.

30:56.285 --> 30:58.126
Shane might not have killed her,

30:58.127 --> 31:00.258
but I bet you, he
switched those bodies.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.559
Then he's in
cahoots with the killer.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.590
What about his buddy Doug?

31:02.591 --> 31:04.062
Don't you worry.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.134
I'm digging deeper
into that alibi, too.

31:06.135 --> 31:07.635
That was Curtis.

31:07.636 --> 31:09.467
We got blood evidence
off the baseball bat.

31:09.468 --> 31:10.868
It's our murder weapon.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.071
Any prints or d.N.A.
On the handle?

31:13.072 --> 31:14.872
D.n.a., and on a hunch,

31:14.873 --> 31:16.074
he ran it against the
baby hair samples

31:16.075 --> 31:17.175
we found at Jackie's house.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.506
Guess what.

31:18.507 --> 31:20.008
Jackie's killer and the
father of Jackie's baby

31:20.009 --> 31:21.179
are one and the same.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.650
Well, we get a match
in the d.N.A. Database?

31:22.651 --> 31:23.952
Mm-hmm.

31:23.953 --> 31:27.285
Your bad-boy rocker...
Jackie's ex, Ronan Gallagher.

31:27.286 --> 31:31.119
We ran your d.N.A. Against
your ex-girlfriend's baby.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.961
Guess what.

31:32.962 --> 31:34.522
You're the father.

31:34.523 --> 31:36.224
Wait. Jackie was...
Was pregnant?

31:36.225 --> 31:37.495
Come on.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.667
You knew she was pregnant.

31:39.668 --> 31:41.529
Oh, look, look, I-I get it.

31:41.530 --> 31:44.632
If it was my wife, and
she was taking my baby,

31:44.633 --> 31:47.135
not only that, she was giving
it away to somebody else,

31:47.136 --> 31:50.509
I would take a bat and I
would beat her to death with it.

31:55.144 --> 31:58.246
I gave her that bat
years ago, for protection.

31:58.247 --> 32:00.019
She must have held on to it.

32:01.991 --> 32:05.123
Was it a boy or a girl?

32:05.124 --> 32:08.026
Was it a boy...

32:08.027 --> 32:09.497
Or a girl?

32:09.498 --> 32:11.099
It was a girl.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.930
Where is she?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.502
(Voice breaks) Did
someone hurt her?

32:14.503 --> 32:16.005
We're looking for her now.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.239
Can I talk to you
outside, please?

32:26.415 --> 32:27.976
Look, you want to clue
me in on the routine

32:27.977 --> 32:30.048
we're running here...
Bad cop/daddy cop?

32:30.049 --> 32:32.150
I have a gut feeling.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.581
(Chuckles) Oh, really?

32:33.582 --> 32:35.984
Now who's falling for the
bad-boy rocker routine?

32:35.985 --> 32:38.286
I don't think he did it.

32:38.287 --> 32:40.128
(Scoffs)

32:40.129 --> 32:42.660
(Footsteps approach)

32:42.661 --> 32:45.394
Hello there.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.966
I really upset you
last night, didn't I?

32:48.967 --> 32:51.099
No, I must have,
or you wouldn't have

32:51.100 --> 32:53.441
turned around
and left so quickly.

32:53.442 --> 32:55.743
I can't believe you told her
the bird-in-the-freezer story.

32:55.744 --> 32:57.245
What I said to her

32:57.246 --> 33:01.009
was that you have been
who you are for a long time.

33:01.010 --> 33:02.480
Oh, so I'm intractable.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.053
That's... (Chuckles)
That's a good lesson. No.

33:05.054 --> 33:06.354
You're committed,

33:06.355 --> 33:08.756
you have a good heart,

33:08.757 --> 33:10.758
you want to know how things work

33:10.759 --> 33:12.990
from the inside out,

33:12.991 --> 33:16.364
and I see the same
things in Lacey...

33:16.365 --> 33:19.097
And myself.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.728
(Knock on door)

33:20.729 --> 33:22.630
Can I talk to you?

33:22.631 --> 33:24.102
(Joan) It's okay.

33:24.103 --> 33:27.135
I said what I came to say.

33:27.136 --> 33:30.538
(People speaking indistinctly)

33:30.539 --> 33:32.540
My gut says, the
boyfriend's innocent.

33:32.541 --> 33:34.312
And what does Sam say?

33:34.313 --> 33:37.245
That I'm crazy, that his d.N.A.
Is on the murder weapon,

33:37.246 --> 33:39.117
that his alibi doesn't
exonerate him,

33:39.118 --> 33:41.789
that he has motive to kill
Jackie and kidnap his kid.

33:41.790 --> 33:44.092
Huh. Is that all? Hmm.

33:44.093 --> 33:45.653
(Knock on door)

33:45.654 --> 33:47.595
Dr. Hunt.

33:47.596 --> 33:51.729
You can stop it with
the sad clown face.

33:51.730 --> 33:52.800
(Laughs)

33:52.801 --> 33:54.502
I trust your gut, partner,

33:54.503 --> 33:56.064
and my own.

33:56.065 --> 33:58.406
So I dug into Shane's
background again.

33:58.407 --> 33:59.737
Guess where he used to work.

33:59.738 --> 34:02.210
Jackie's last workplace.

34:02.211 --> 34:04.143
The limousine service.

34:05.514 --> 34:07.075
Bingo.

34:07.076 --> 34:09.577
I've never seen
him before, but...

34:09.578 --> 34:11.549
This place has the
highest turnover.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.352
Ask Mitch. He's
been here the longest.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.053
Yo, Mitch.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.756
Come here for a sec.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.593
Know this guy?

34:26.365 --> 34:29.368
(Power tools whirring)

34:33.542 --> 34:35.603
No.

34:35.604 --> 34:37.375
I've never seen him before.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.147
Hmm. That's odd,

34:39.148 --> 34:40.849
considering he's your brother.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.611
What?

34:43.612 --> 34:46.254
Brachydactyly type d,

34:46.255 --> 34:48.816
also known as clubbed thumbs.

34:48.817 --> 34:50.158
Siblings share it.

34:50.159 --> 34:52.160
You have it, and so does Shane.

34:52.161 --> 34:53.661
The only question is,

34:53.662 --> 34:55.293
what did you do
with Jackie's baby

34:55.294 --> 34:57.866
after you killed her and had
your brother dump the body?

35:00.799 --> 35:01.799
(Chuckles)

35:01.800 --> 35:03.271
Listen...

35:03.272 --> 35:05.103
I don't know what you...

35:06.775 --> 35:09.207
(Sam grunts)

35:09.208 --> 35:11.779
Ah! Ahh.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.341
(Pants)

35:13.342 --> 35:15.113
(Handcuffs click)

35:21.890 --> 35:24.392
Where is she, Mitch?

35:24.393 --> 35:26.123
Hmm?

35:26.124 --> 35:28.796
Where is that little baby that
has no one left in the world

35:28.797 --> 35:31.229
because you killed her mother?

35:31.230 --> 35:34.162
Or should I amend the charge

35:34.163 --> 35:36.133
to double homicide?

35:36.134 --> 35:38.807
I'm saying nothing, man.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.719
He hasn't lawyered up,

35:51.720 --> 35:53.581
but he sure as hell clammed up.

35:53.582 --> 35:55.583
What did that midwife
say she gave the baby

35:55.584 --> 35:57.755
to keep her quiet?

35:57.756 --> 35:59.928
Chamomile, licorice and mint.

36:07.396 --> 36:10.598
You might not want to talk to
this detective here... (Door closes)

36:10.599 --> 36:11.899
But let me tell you

36:11.900 --> 36:14.302
a couple of things
that he already knows.

36:14.303 --> 36:16.204
You killed Jackie,

36:16.205 --> 36:18.906
and your brother
disposed of the body.

36:18.907 --> 36:21.849
But something
happened in between.

36:21.850 --> 36:23.751
You saw that baby,

36:23.752 --> 36:25.513
Jackie's daughter,

36:25.514 --> 36:27.685
alone, crying out for her,

36:27.686 --> 36:29.857
and you had to shut her up.

36:29.858 --> 36:30.918
That rash on your hand?

36:30.919 --> 36:33.721
I think you're having
an allergic reaction

36:33.722 --> 36:35.363
to chamomile.

36:35.364 --> 36:36.924
That tells me something.

36:36.925 --> 36:38.866
You're not a baby killer.

36:38.867 --> 36:40.698
You gave that baby chamomile,

36:40.699 --> 36:43.571
mint, and licorice.

36:43.572 --> 36:45.903
Jackie must have
showed you how to do it.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.905
You took her
medicine when you left,

36:47.906 --> 36:49.977
and you have
been giving it to her,

36:49.978 --> 36:51.479
I would say,

36:51.480 --> 36:53.641
up until...

36:53.642 --> 36:55.714
Two hours ago.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.392
You have that baby.

37:04.393 --> 37:07.795
I know you do.

37:07.796 --> 37:10.728
And you've kept her safe.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.230
(Inhales deeply)

37:13.231 --> 37:15.404
(Exhales)

37:17.766 --> 37:20.938
So I drive...

37:20.939 --> 37:25.012
These rich sons of
bitches around for...

37:25.013 --> 37:26.944
Years.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.977
I put my brother
through medical school.

37:29.978 --> 37:32.880
They're not all bad.

37:32.881 --> 37:34.982
There's this couple.

37:34.983 --> 37:38.025
The husband, he's a nice
guy, and the wife, she's...

37:38.026 --> 37:40.828
She's a nice lady.

37:40.829 --> 37:42.960
I drive her because
she's losing her eyesight.

37:42.961 --> 37:46.364
And they want to
have kids, but he can't.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.936
And the adoption agencies
keep turning 'em down

37:48.937 --> 37:49.937
because of her condition.

37:49.938 --> 37:52.800
That's... that's...
That's not fair.

37:52.801 --> 37:54.942
And one day, I find Jackie,

37:54.943 --> 37:56.944
and she's puking in the toilet,

37:56.945 --> 37:59.347
and she's pregnant, and...

37:59.348 --> 38:01.278
She can't tell the father,
and she can't afford to keep it.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.351
Everybody wins.

38:03.352 --> 38:05.483
So, yeah, I hooked it up.

38:05.484 --> 38:09.917
I mean, Jackie quit her job,
the couple paid for everything...

38:09.918 --> 38:11.989
Bills, rent.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.822
All she has to do is
keep herself healthy,

38:14.823 --> 38:16.994
just until the baby comes.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.066
She gets paid, you get paid,

38:19.067 --> 38:20.768
your brother's
medical school bills

38:20.769 --> 38:21.769
vanish overnight.

38:21.770 --> 38:23.801
And then what happened?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.703
Jackie wants to keep the baby.

38:25.704 --> 38:28.606
(Sighs) She gets an
e-mail from the father,

38:28.607 --> 38:31.339
saying he's...
Cleaned up his act,

38:31.340 --> 38:32.740
maybe they can be together.

38:32.741 --> 38:34.812
And then, man, I'm desperate.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.314
So I break in.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.487
I just want the baby,

38:39.488 --> 38:43.891
to give to the couple,
like we all talked about.

38:43.892 --> 38:45.553
And then Jackie, she
wakes up, you know,

38:45.554 --> 38:47.625
and she comes at me,
and she's got a baseball bat,

38:47.626 --> 38:50.057
and i'm... and i-i... So
I take it away from her,

38:50.058 --> 38:52.059
and she... i... you
know, I hit her?

38:52.060 --> 38:55.002
I don't... (Sighs)

38:55.003 --> 38:56.734
Oh.

38:56.735 --> 38:57.905
(Sniffles)

38:57.906 --> 39:00.808
(Crying)

39:00.809 --> 39:02.911
Where's the baby now?

39:05.914 --> 39:08.345
Philly p.D.!

39:08.346 --> 39:11.349
(Baby crying)

39:14.653 --> 39:17.656
(Crying continues)

39:24.062 --> 39:27.035
(Crying)

39:29.998 --> 39:31.499
(Whispers) Yes. Shh.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.102
Shh.

39:37.406 --> 39:40.478
(Fusses)

39:40.479 --> 39:42.049
You're gonna be good at this.

39:42.050 --> 39:44.912
(Coos)

39:44.913 --> 39:47.115
(Knocks on door)

39:51.520 --> 39:55.122
(Fussing)

39:55.123 --> 39:56.664
(Crying)

39:56.665 --> 39:57.995
Shh.

39:57.996 --> 40:01.470
(Continues crying)

40:08.777 --> 40:12.710
(Fusses)

40:12.711 --> 40:16.084
(Crying)

40:20.549 --> 40:22.551
(Elevator bell dings)

40:24.092 --> 40:27.095
(People speaking indistinctly)

40:32.731 --> 40:34.562
You going out?

40:34.563 --> 40:36.934
Going to a party.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.467
(Doors close)

40:39.468 --> 40:41.809
(Sighs)

40:41.810 --> 40:44.772
Yep. This silence would've
been really awkward

40:44.773 --> 40:47.445
if we had slept together.

40:49.478 --> 40:50.749
(Both chuckle)

40:54.452 --> 40:56.554
How are things with your dad?

40:56.555 --> 40:58.055
Thanks for asking.

40:58.056 --> 41:01.159
Um, still going to
hell, apparently.

41:04.633 --> 41:07.536
Me, too.

41:25.584 --> 41:26.754
Hello, dora.

41:26.755 --> 41:28.616
Hi, Dr. Hunt.
You're... you're busy.

41:28.617 --> 41:30.117
I figured.

41:30.118 --> 41:31.218
I just...

41:31.219 --> 41:32.960
Wanted to say thank you.

41:32.961 --> 41:34.261
No, you're very welcome, dora.

41:34.262 --> 41:36.193
Um, Shane is in custody.

41:36.194 --> 41:40.628
Your crazy theory turned
out to be not so crazy.

41:40.629 --> 41:42.269
You know, you
could be good at this.

41:42.270 --> 41:44.231
Have you ever thought
about specializing

41:44.232 --> 41:46.233
in forensic pathology?

41:46.234 --> 41:48.706
No, um, you know,

41:48.707 --> 41:51.609
I was actually
thinking psychiatry.

41:51.610 --> 41:52.610
Huh.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.111
Yeah.

41:54.112 --> 41:57.014
I want to know what makes
people like Shane do what they do.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.016
(Whispers) No cell phones.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.517
Like mother, like
daughter I guess.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.890
I guess so.

42:03.221 --> 42:04.192
Stay in touch.

42:04.193 --> 42:05.193
Bye. Bye.

42:05.194 --> 42:07.224
(Beeps)

42:07.225 --> 42:09.597
Is that popcorn I smell?

42:09.598 --> 42:12.529
Air popped. No salt.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.201
I'm in...

42:14.202 --> 42:15.863
With salt.

42:15.864 --> 42:18.135
No friends tonight?

42:18.136 --> 42:20.638
No, just you and me...

42:20.639 --> 42:22.269
And Robert pattinson.

42:22.270 --> 42:24.742
(Both laugh)

42:24.743 --> 42:26.273
Go, team Edward.

42:26.274 --> 42:28.115
Exactly. (Laughs)

42:28.116 --> 42:29.578
(Laughs)
