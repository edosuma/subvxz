00:00.040 --> 00:02.687
- Previously on "The Mist"...
- There's something out there.

00:02.742 --> 00:03.882
The Black Spring.

00:03.921 --> 00:05.789
It's like our version of Santa,

00:05.882 --> 00:07.092
but instead of not getting gifts,

00:07.117 --> 00:09.187
if you don't behave,
you'll be torn apart alive.

00:09.234 --> 00:10.716
My family's at the mall.
I've gotta get to them.

00:10.756 --> 00:12.124
What if it doesn't have any keys?

00:12.191 --> 00:14.505
- I'll bet Mia knows how to hot-wire.
- Of course I do.

00:14.576 --> 00:17.607
What if we put the bodies outside,
use them as bait...

00:18.397 --> 00:21.415
- What the hell?
- They were American soldiers!

00:21.852 --> 00:23.525
Hey, stop it!

00:23.564 --> 00:24.895
- Guys, guys.
- Stop it!

00:24.970 --> 00:27.278
I think we need
to establish a set of rules.

00:27.357 --> 00:29.958
Whoever endangers the group
is thrown out of the mall.

00:30.029 --> 00:32.031
It's okay to be scared
about what happened.

00:32.097 --> 00:34.454
Should I be scared about
the people who hung themselves

00:34.532 --> 00:36.399
or that big cloud
of whatever-it-is outside,

00:36.469 --> 00:37.875
or do you mean
that I'm stuck in this mall

00:37.930 --> 00:40.890
with the guy who raped me?
Who says I'm feeling anything?

00:40.937 --> 00:43.312
Your daughter gets drunk
and screws around,

00:43.366 --> 00:44.726
and it's my boy's fault?

00:44.812 --> 00:47.366
But then again, that makes
perfect sense, knowing your wife.

01:18.686 --> 01:19.980
Jesus!

01:21.547 --> 01:22.648
We gotta go!

01:23.678 --> 01:24.612
Over there.

01:27.190 --> 01:28.224
Driver's seat.

01:31.027 --> 01:32.495
Will this help?

01:41.671 --> 01:42.772
Shit.

01:42.839 --> 01:43.940
Hey!

01:45.751 --> 01:47.286
Connor dropped it.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.103
Next time somebody
drops a gun, you give it to me.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.505
You didn't see what happened to Mikhail.

01:51.706 --> 01:53.374
What happened to Mikhail?

01:53.441 --> 01:55.176
A giant moth killed him!

01:56.411 --> 01:57.879
A giant moth?

01:58.199 --> 02:00.395
Can we get going? I don't like it here.

02:00.582 --> 02:01.942
I just need this one

02:02.270 --> 02:06.200
and then this one, and then, there.

02:06.719 --> 02:08.488
What the... Come on!

02:08.560 --> 02:10.024
I thought you said
you knew how to do this.

02:10.058 --> 02:11.708
I can! I can. Something's wrong.

02:11.763 --> 02:12.988
What do you mean, something's wrong?!

02:13.013 --> 02:14.476
I've done this a thousand times!

02:14.501 --> 02:15.650
Even if the battery's dead,

02:15.720 --> 02:17.684
we should hear the ignition
trying to catch.

02:17.751 --> 02:18.718
Listen.

02:20.403 --> 02:22.705
Come on. What the...

02:22.751 --> 02:25.659
Come...

02:26.860 --> 02:29.029
We need to find a working car.

02:30.297 --> 02:31.364
Uh...

02:32.432 --> 02:34.200
all right, all right.

02:34.267 --> 02:36.202
There's a gas station right
around the corner from here.

02:36.236 --> 02:37.804
We can't go back out there.

02:37.871 --> 02:40.475
Well, how long do you think we've got

02:40.530 --> 02:42.207
before something happens?

02:42.208 --> 02:43.643
It seems like the mist
comes and go, right?

02:43.710 --> 02:45.022
It's thicker when we're out there,

02:45.066 --> 02:46.667
and then it kind of disappears
when we're not.

02:46.803 --> 02:49.881
Yeah, it was super thick
when Mikhail, you know...

02:50.283 --> 02:52.085
Okay, okay.

02:52.218 --> 02:54.209
So we wait for it
to withdraw a little bit,

02:54.321 --> 02:56.556
and then we make a run for it. Okay?

02:56.623 --> 02:59.162
- Okay.
- All right.

02:59.338 --> 03:01.106
The mist is starting to thin out.

03:01.161 --> 03:02.112
Okay.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.643
- Just follow me, all right?
- Yep.

03:03.729 --> 03:05.463
- You stay close to me.
- Okay.

03:05.542 --> 03:08.580
Okay. 1, 2...

03:09.903 --> 03:11.201
3.

03:13.898 --> 03:16.132
No! Leave me alone!

03:16.208 --> 03:17.952
- What's going on?
- Leave her alone!

03:18.011 --> 03:19.012
Sue!

03:19.079 --> 03:21.180
- Calm down now.
- Come on.

03:22.315 --> 03:23.450
- I can't breathe.
- Okay.

03:23.516 --> 03:25.585
I can't breathe.

03:25.652 --> 03:27.466
Come on.

03:27.538 --> 03:30.551
Come on. It's okay. It's okay.

03:35.462 --> 03:37.666
Another panic attack?

03:38.198 --> 03:40.967
Well, there's nothing to do
but sit around being scared.

03:42.702 --> 03:44.771
That's why we gotta distract 'em.

03:47.398 --> 03:49.074
Let's see what we got here.

03:52.876 --> 03:54.711
- All right.
- Here you go.

03:57.419 --> 03:58.720
Who's up for poker?

03:58.937 --> 04:00.405
Yeah, sure.

04:00.471 --> 04:01.639
Here. Take this one.

04:06.411 --> 04:10.748
What? Those teens won't say no
to Bridgeville's star quarterback.

04:19.230 --> 04:20.425
Go long.

04:27.106 --> 04:28.241
Yeah.

04:37.508 --> 04:39.711
Look, babe, nothing was gonna happen.

04:39.777 --> 04:42.247
Maybe you just listen
to me once, you know,

04:42.313 --> 04:44.215
instead of always listening
to your asshole friend.

04:46.351 --> 04:48.953
Hope you geniuses aren't planning
another science experiment.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.481
Hey, if I'm looking to get date raped,

04:50.520 --> 04:52.123
I'll invite you into the conversation.

05:46.024 --> 05:48.446
- Are you all right, Father?
- It's a little out of tune.

05:52.759 --> 05:54.252
Father?

05:54.319 --> 05:56.251
You know I've always been devout.

05:56.358 --> 05:58.226
I've...

05:59.329 --> 06:03.693
I believe in the Bible.
I live life by His word...

06:05.096 --> 06:06.980
more or less.

06:07.714 --> 06:09.634
Do you think
you lost your faith, Father?

06:09.701 --> 06:11.135
Lose my faith? How could I?

06:11.202 --> 06:12.527
I've just seen a demon appear

06:12.558 --> 06:14.191
and the smoke rising from the pit

06:14.253 --> 06:16.774
to torment mankind
just as it's written in Gospel.

06:17.317 --> 06:19.801
I'm not scared
because I'm losing my faith.

06:20.039 --> 06:23.137
I'm scared because
it's stronger than ever.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.858
If we were judged right now,

06:33.925 --> 06:35.693
how many under our roof would burn?

06:36.801 --> 06:38.136
Would Mrs. Raven?

06:38.429 --> 06:41.293
Or will God forgive her
because she's gone crazy?

06:41.466 --> 06:42.734
Would the Chief?

06:42.800 --> 06:44.335
We've all seen his pride.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.473
Would you?

06:53.589 --> 06:54.712
Would you?

06:56.648 --> 06:58.040
The more I believe,

06:58.117 --> 07:02.087
the more I know it's my
responsibility to save them...

07:04.455 --> 07:07.058
and I've never been more afraid.

07:09.060 --> 07:10.662
Are you there?

07:13.064 --> 07:14.933
Are you there?

07:15.066 --> 07:16.267
Are you there?

07:16.334 --> 07:17.735
Who are you looking for, Natalie?

07:17.802 --> 07:19.170
I don't know yet.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.076
Friends, would you gather, please?

07:31.578 --> 07:33.852
- Mrs. Raven?
- Mm, not right now.

07:38.289 --> 07:41.593
Most of you have been
coming here for years.

07:42.074 --> 07:46.097
Most of you know me, just as
I know you and your families.

07:47.131 --> 07:50.563
We know each other too well for me to...

07:52.133 --> 07:53.914
- preach.
- Mm-hm.

07:55.940 --> 07:58.209
Instead, I will talk to you here.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.277
I believe Judgment Day has come.

08:05.675 --> 08:07.626
And I'm... I'm laughing,

08:07.681 --> 08:10.095
because I... I watch TV.

08:10.149 --> 08:13.424
I... I like baseball.

08:13.491 --> 08:14.759
I...

08:16.127 --> 08:17.629
I listen to music.

08:17.695 --> 08:19.797
I have a beer every now and then.

08:19.864 --> 08:21.656
I'm not the Judgment Day kind of guy.

08:21.701 --> 08:23.136
You know that.

08:25.703 --> 08:29.274
And yet, here we are.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.150
I hope I'm wrong.

08:32.197 --> 08:34.563
I hope the police get here to save us.

08:34.691 --> 08:36.549
But until then,

08:36.988 --> 08:41.458
I will do whatever I can
to help save your souls...

08:42.520 --> 08:43.922
pray with you.

08:48.488 --> 08:49.956
Mrs. Raven, please.

08:50.815 --> 08:53.471
That's very sweet, Father,
but there's really no need.

08:54.073 --> 08:56.334
The moth is a good friend of mine.

08:59.771 --> 09:03.140
And how is that possible?

09:03.679 --> 09:05.914
We met in my garden the other day.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.414
She landed on my hand.

09:08.666 --> 09:11.297
Will you care to explain to us

09:11.806 --> 09:13.508
what it was doing here, then?

09:14.332 --> 09:16.066
I don't know,

09:16.401 --> 09:17.965
but I'll find out.

09:23.023 --> 09:24.158
Are you there?

09:37.107 --> 09:38.942
I didn't see any cars out there.

09:50.889 --> 09:52.323
There's nothing in here, either.

09:58.630 --> 10:00.532
Maybe this guy will give us a ride.

10:36.271 --> 10:38.451
Any way to get any gas out of those?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.443
I wouldn't want to be out there
long enough to find out.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.177
You're Eve's husband, right?

10:48.280 --> 10:49.281
Yeah.

10:49.347 --> 10:50.782
You know where she is?

10:52.617 --> 10:54.052
I'm sorry.

10:56.688 --> 10:57.656
I'm Clay.

10:57.722 --> 10:59.191
Kevin.

10:59.257 --> 11:02.661
I had a kid in her class. I have a...

11:04.029 --> 11:06.232
He was outside when all this happened.

11:06.464 --> 11:08.967
He's safe somewhere. I know it.
I just gotta find him.

11:09.949 --> 11:11.317
I'm sure he is.

11:13.948 --> 11:15.073
Have you seen him?

11:26.952 --> 11:28.382
No.

11:28.812 --> 11:30.155
Sorry.

11:55.858 --> 11:57.293
You should, uh...

11:57.516 --> 12:00.428
You should stay here, get some rest.

12:01.753 --> 12:03.955
I haven't slept in two days.

12:05.824 --> 12:08.527
You can, uh, put it in the garage.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.447
Please tell me why we're lying
to this poor bastard.

12:31.947 --> 12:33.718
We should tell him.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.510
He has a working car,

12:36.564 --> 12:39.776
and in case you haven't noticed,
we're kinda stuck here.

12:40.643 --> 12:42.042
It's your wife and kid.

12:42.651 --> 12:44.604
Like you care about them.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.435
I'll talk to him.
I'll get him to take us.

12:50.502 --> 12:51.736
Good.

12:51.803 --> 12:53.238
You gonna keep your mouth shut?

12:53.305 --> 12:54.987
I don't know.
Are you gonna convince him?

13:09.647 --> 13:11.923
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were here.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.787
Uh...

13:14.534 --> 13:16.013
it's okay.

13:17.195 --> 13:19.364
I guess you think I'm crazy as well.

13:20.765 --> 13:22.834
- Kind of.
- Mm, I may be,

13:22.901 --> 13:26.104
but I can see you're not yourself.

13:26.171 --> 13:27.172
Can I do anything?

13:28.273 --> 13:29.474
They took my gun.

13:32.377 --> 13:33.945
I don't think they'll rob a bank.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.314
I just let three prisoners escape

13:37.378 --> 13:39.246
in front of the whole church.

13:39.384 --> 13:41.080
So what?

13:41.386 --> 13:43.288
It's my job to enforce the law.

13:43.355 --> 13:47.682
Oh, the law is just people
trying to control human nature,

13:47.959 --> 13:49.604
as if that were possible.

13:49.704 --> 13:53.074
No one can do that, not even you.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.569
Thanks, Natalie.

14:00.238 --> 14:03.417
There will be food soon, if you want.

14:09.648 --> 14:10.749
Natalie?

14:10.930 --> 14:14.250
Uh, I think my presence
makes Father Romanov uncomfortable.

14:16.454 --> 14:17.856
I insist.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.111
You need to eat, honey.

14:29.256 --> 14:30.591
But it's so dark.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.524
I didn't like the dark either,

14:34.773 --> 14:36.618
until my dad found a cure.

14:37.416 --> 14:40.486
He made up a story called
"The Owl Who Says What."

14:40.623 --> 14:41.924
He even wrote a book about it.

14:42.650 --> 14:44.382
Owls say, "Who."

14:44.449 --> 14:46.534
Yeah, not this one.

14:46.718 --> 14:48.620
The other owls left him by himself

14:48.650 --> 14:51.553
alone in the dark,
because he was different.

14:51.723 --> 14:53.558
- Was he scared?
- Yeah,

14:53.698 --> 14:56.728
but he discovers a way
not to be afraid of the dark.

14:57.214 --> 14:58.862
How?

14:59.197 --> 15:01.198
I could read it to you if you want.

15:01.409 --> 15:03.050
I'm sure the bookstore has it.

15:03.186 --> 15:04.921
You want to go?

15:07.256 --> 15:08.724
We're gonna go to the bookstore.

15:10.718 --> 15:12.553
I guess. Sure.

15:23.659 --> 15:24.714
I'll tidy up.

15:35.122 --> 15:37.024
She adores her father.

15:39.704 --> 15:41.573
He must be a good guy.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.013
He is.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.482
How bad is it between you and him?

15:53.881 --> 15:55.826
Is it that obvious?

15:57.722 --> 15:59.768
I was married for 10 years.

16:00.194 --> 16:03.823
I mean, not married,
because we couldn't get married,

16:03.917 --> 16:07.565
but we lived together, and I loved her.

16:09.174 --> 16:13.054
But she was the most annoying
person I've ever met.

16:13.413 --> 16:15.843
I know a frustrated woman
when I see one.

16:21.179 --> 16:22.761
Kevin's a good person.

16:23.034 --> 16:26.777
He's kind and sensitive.

16:27.331 --> 16:29.620
He's patient. He's a great listener.

16:29.921 --> 16:31.979
He sounds awful.

16:40.128 --> 16:42.763
His love for Alex is endless.

16:42.951 --> 16:45.140
He needs her love to be the same.

16:45.381 --> 16:47.537
He needs it so much, he can't say no.

16:47.737 --> 16:49.490
He never could.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.230
And now, it put her in danger.

16:59.113 --> 17:00.996
I'm happy he's not here.

17:07.759 --> 17:09.728
In the name of the Father and of the Son

17:09.761 --> 17:11.827
and of the Holy Spirit,
bless us, O Lord,

17:11.891 --> 17:14.343
and these, thy gifts
which we are about to receive

17:14.432 --> 17:16.434
from thy bounty
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

17:16.501 --> 17:18.223
In the name of the Father and of the Son

17:18.292 --> 17:20.378
- and the Holy Spirit, amen.
- Amen.

17:29.107 --> 17:31.209
What are you reading, Mrs. Raven?

17:31.583 --> 17:33.842
The journal of one
of the first priests here.

17:33.915 --> 17:35.810
I found it in your office.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.635
Well, if you have any
questions about church history,

17:38.690 --> 17:40.322
I'd be happy to help.

17:40.658 --> 17:43.697
Did you know this is not the first time
nature's come alive?

17:44.479 --> 17:46.865
Six people were killed
by wildlife here in Bridgeville

17:46.932 --> 17:48.700
on May 12th in 1860.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.546
Five more the next day.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.437
Three more the following.

17:53.531 --> 17:57.023
And you think this is related
to what we saw outside?

17:57.108 --> 17:59.311
Of course.
They called it the Black Spring.

17:59.377 --> 18:00.912
Natalie, I...

18:03.615 --> 18:05.291
You're looking for answers.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.685
We're all looking for answers.
It's human.

18:09.020 --> 18:12.787
But I beg you, look in the Bible.

18:13.568 --> 18:15.460
Your answers are there.

18:18.363 --> 18:20.727
Not just to this, to your pain as well.

18:23.983 --> 18:25.813
Why look f...

18:26.471 --> 18:29.007
Do you even know
what you're looking for?

18:43.722 --> 18:44.923
There it is.

18:47.432 --> 18:48.599
What?

18:51.096 --> 18:52.531
What I'm looking for.

18:52.769 --> 18:54.504
Ooh, that's a big one.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.434
- Oh, I got it.
- No!

19:05.710 --> 19:07.445
I found it.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.284
Thank you.

19:30.884 --> 19:32.452
Dinner is served.

19:34.955 --> 19:36.156
Thanks.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.980
I'm sorry about the gun.

19:45.232 --> 19:47.058
You see anyone else
when you were out there?

19:47.300 --> 19:49.379
We've been trying to find a car.
We can't find one that works.

19:49.551 --> 19:51.386
You haven't been out
in a while, have you?

19:51.731 --> 19:53.232
Cars stopped working.

19:53.314 --> 19:55.159
No, we drove through the mist
when we first got here.

19:55.267 --> 19:57.682
Yeah, but I was out
driving yesterday, looking.

19:57.904 --> 20:00.106
Couple people on the road
trying to get away, I guess.

20:00.154 --> 20:01.373
Then they just stopped

20:01.418 --> 20:03.988
at the same time, just like that.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.873
I've seen a couple working since then,

20:05.912 --> 20:07.613
but most of them just died.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.028
I got this from one
of those survivalist types.

20:10.103 --> 20:13.629
I wanted a family car,
but Toby thought it was so cool.

20:14.435 --> 20:17.715
Guy said he bought it because it
was a bug-out vehicle, you know,

20:17.757 --> 20:19.625
so old it didn't have a circuit board,

20:19.692 --> 20:22.597
in case aliens or whatever came
and fried our technology.

20:22.691 --> 20:24.559
I... I don't know anymore.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.862
I just know it's one
of the only ones that works.

20:28.745 --> 20:31.815
You should've seen how proud
Toby was riding in it.

20:37.877 --> 20:39.437
You know, Eve and I,

20:40.109 --> 20:41.570
we have a daughter.

20:42.648 --> 20:44.202
Her name is Alex.

20:44.517 --> 20:45.952
Where are they?

20:46.343 --> 20:48.364
They're at the mall.

20:48.788 --> 20:50.075
It's where I've been trying to go.

20:50.356 --> 20:52.358
I was hoping you could drive us.

20:54.026 --> 20:56.667
I... I wish I could, I really do,

20:56.721 --> 20:58.862
but I'm down to an eighth of a tank,

20:59.393 --> 21:02.300
and I'm gonna need every drop
to find my son.

21:05.964 --> 21:06.960
I'm sorry.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.816
Do me a favor,
and just sleep on it, all right?

21:55.609 --> 21:56.877
All right.

22:00.949 --> 22:02.849
"There once was an owl

22:02.916 --> 22:05.352
who said, 'What, ' and not, 'Who.'"

22:07.621 --> 22:09.222
You're sure about this, right?

22:09.465 --> 22:10.608
You prefer to keep listening

22:10.662 --> 22:12.155
to them bitching
about us being childish,

22:12.217 --> 22:14.227
or do you want to be a hero,

22:14.639 --> 22:17.532
and have Zoe be all, "Mmm,
you're my Mr. Strong Man.

22:17.579 --> 22:18.923
I want you so bad, Ted"?

22:18.977 --> 22:20.579
- Yo, stop it!
- "Oh, I want you, Ted.

22:20.618 --> 22:22.202
Your tiny, little arms
are turning me on."

22:22.269 --> 22:23.737
Okay. Okay.

22:23.804 --> 22:26.998
Besides, we don't have to go out there.

22:27.716 --> 22:29.678
Picked this up in sporting goods.

22:34.772 --> 22:37.207
Fucking boom.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.616
I mean, you're a sick bastard.

22:41.299 --> 22:42.300
Mm-hmm.

22:42.742 --> 22:43.943
Let's do this.

22:50.098 --> 22:52.137
We're sure this is safe, right?

22:52.265 --> 22:54.737
We served up two soldiers
in a shopping cart,

22:54.799 --> 22:56.269
not even a nibble.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.739
And if we see something,
we'll just close the door, okay?

22:59.806 --> 23:00.740
Okay.

23:13.972 --> 23:15.555
Did you hear something?

23:16.355 --> 23:17.745
It's fine.

23:18.167 --> 23:19.893
Let's reel it in.

23:25.528 --> 23:27.297
- You got it?
- There we go.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.465
Okay, okay.

23:28.567 --> 23:29.778
There she is.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.096
I'll get the door.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.669
"Then the owl said, 'Who are you to say

23:36.720 --> 23:38.522
I can't say "what" '?

23:38.900 --> 23:42.572
But the other owls
just said, 'Who, who, who.'"

23:42.979 --> 23:44.414
That's not nice of them.

23:46.211 --> 23:48.013
Okay, next one. Ready?

23:49.786 --> 23:51.821
- Oh, shit.
- Damn!

23:57.758 --> 24:00.063
Wait, wait. wait.
Stop, stop, stop! It's stuck.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.196
Hey, screw it. Yeah.

24:06.336 --> 24:07.931
Don't let go of the line.

24:08.595 --> 24:10.369
Otherwise, I might not find my way.

24:18.645 --> 24:20.536
Ted.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.296
Ted?

24:33.363 --> 24:34.664
Ted?

24:39.035 --> 24:40.604
Ted!

24:59.395 --> 25:01.771
Um, stay here.

25:06.730 --> 25:08.544
Ted!

25:08.698 --> 25:10.302
Help! Help!

25:18.196 --> 25:20.089
Help! Please!

25:20.128 --> 25:21.663
Somebody!

25:23.785 --> 25:25.230
Lila!

25:25.448 --> 25:27.003
Lila!

25:28.302 --> 25:30.337
- Lila?
- Alex!

25:30.420 --> 25:32.673
- Where are you?
- I'm scared.

25:32.775 --> 25:34.376
I know, but we gotta go, okay?

25:37.513 --> 25:39.560
Oh, my God! It was an accident!

25:39.607 --> 25:41.029
I didn't mean to do it! I really didn't!

25:41.060 --> 25:42.999
- Where?
- Bookstore.

25:48.471 --> 25:50.674
Run!

26:00.814 --> 26:02.926
- Jesus.
- Somebody please help!

26:03.051 --> 26:05.046
Yeah, the Copeland girl.

26:05.113 --> 26:06.648
Alex, help!

26:06.735 --> 26:09.047
- Where are you?
- Lila!

26:09.184 --> 26:11.305
- Lila!
- Over here!

26:11.349 --> 26:12.493
Holy shit!

26:13.602 --> 26:15.358
What the fuck is that?

26:16.958 --> 26:19.749
Is she in there? Get out of my way!

26:19.811 --> 26:20.882
No, no, no. You can't! You can't!

26:20.913 --> 26:22.730
- Don't let it in!
- Lila! Lila!

26:22.797 --> 26:24.913
Don't! Look... Look at that!

26:24.988 --> 26:28.132
- We open the door, we all die!
- Lila, run! Help! No!

26:28.163 --> 26:29.569
Alex!

26:29.593 --> 26:30.779
Look, I didn't know she was in there.

26:30.804 --> 26:32.392
Mom!

26:33.006 --> 26:35.188
- You can't go in there. It's not safe!
- Lila!

26:35.935 --> 26:37.665
Run, baby!

26:38.512 --> 26:40.380
Run!

26:58.177 --> 26:59.812
No!

27:18.427 --> 27:20.185
Lila!

27:47.842 --> 27:48.952
Eve.

27:55.154 --> 27:56.969
You okay? Oh.

28:02.408 --> 28:05.196
You okay? What happened?

28:05.329 --> 28:07.110
I just...

28:07.696 --> 28:11.696
I... I fought it, hard as I could.

28:38.404 --> 28:40.404
I am concerned about her.

28:40.756 --> 28:42.951
She's always had some funny ideas.

28:44.416 --> 28:46.435
But she's hurting herself.

28:47.453 --> 28:51.360
Last night, she referred
to the spider as God.

28:53.425 --> 28:55.461
First the moth, then this.

28:55.528 --> 28:57.251
It is idolatry.

28:57.463 --> 29:00.287
If this is Judgment Day,
she will be judged for it.

29:00.668 --> 29:02.203
And if it's not?

29:03.949 --> 29:05.654
You haven't been out there,

29:06.098 --> 29:07.533
not the way I have.

29:08.028 --> 29:09.723
When I was,

29:10.466 --> 29:12.122
I felt something.

29:13.045 --> 29:14.520
What did you feel?

29:16.182 --> 29:17.583
That it knew me.

30:07.445 --> 30:08.501
I'm sorry.

30:09.602 --> 30:10.536
Please.

30:10.603 --> 30:12.104
I have to look out for my boy.

30:12.171 --> 30:13.482
You'd do the same.

30:13.542 --> 30:15.090
You have the only working car.

30:15.232 --> 30:17.067
You're my only chance.

30:17.276 --> 30:18.817
- You understand that?
- Yes, I do.

30:20.779 --> 30:22.181
Are you gonna tell him, or should I?

30:22.248 --> 30:23.616
Mia, I'm taking care of this.

30:23.682 --> 30:24.818
Well, if you were, we wouldn't have

30:24.873 --> 30:26.552
spent the night sleeping
in a goddamn minimart.

30:26.619 --> 30:28.487
There is nothing
that you can say to help.

30:32.725 --> 30:34.757
Look, your son is dead.

30:35.394 --> 30:36.495
We saw him.

30:39.265 --> 30:40.399
You're lying.

30:43.402 --> 30:45.590
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

30:50.973 --> 30:52.975
You're lying.

30:53.292 --> 30:54.412
You're lying.

30:54.456 --> 30:55.991
You didn't see what we saw.

30:56.057 --> 30:57.726
If you had, you'd understand.

30:57.799 --> 30:59.736
No, you would have told me
when I showed you the photo.

30:59.790 --> 31:01.529
You're lying.
You made this up to get my car!

31:01.596 --> 31:04.065
I'm not gonna do it!
I'm gonna find my son!

31:04.132 --> 31:06.874
He's alive! I know it!

31:09.684 --> 31:10.885
Tell him.

31:15.670 --> 31:16.904
Tell him!

31:19.893 --> 31:21.440
He's dead.

31:21.994 --> 31:23.659
I told them not to tell you.

31:23.918 --> 31:25.878
Why?

31:26.549 --> 31:28.151
I didn't want to take away your hope.

31:28.390 --> 31:30.057
I'm sorry.

31:30.225 --> 31:32.033
- I truly am.
- You stop saying that.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.864
He's not coming back.
He's not, and you're stopping us from...

31:34.930 --> 31:36.049
Just shut up!

31:36.104 --> 31:37.736
You are not gonna get the car!

31:37.799 --> 31:39.367
You're not gonna get the car!

31:39.434 --> 31:42.337
I will kill you all, if I have to!

31:47.074 --> 31:48.243
Shoot him!

31:49.611 --> 31:52.280
Come on! Shoot him!

31:56.395 --> 31:58.164
I'm so sorry.

31:58.528 --> 32:00.263
I didn't mean to.

32:00.455 --> 32:01.856
Get the towel.

32:06.218 --> 32:07.452
Do you have a belt?

32:09.183 --> 32:11.118
Here, put pressure.

32:15.738 --> 32:18.273
If we don't get him
to a hospital, he's gonna die.

32:23.425 --> 32:24.679
I'm so sorry.

32:24.761 --> 32:26.663
But you have to understand,

32:26.982 --> 32:28.343
it really was an accident.

32:28.406 --> 32:30.156
We were trying to do
the right thing. We messed up.

32:30.226 --> 32:32.234
Shelley lost her little girl
because of it.

32:32.296 --> 32:33.488
And I'm so sorry.

32:33.555 --> 32:35.123
I promise. It'll never happen again.

32:35.190 --> 32:37.691
That's what you said after sending
my friends out in the mist.

32:39.330 --> 32:41.065
Don't look at me. I'm not the king.

32:41.296 --> 32:42.829
So what do we do?

32:43.188 --> 32:45.360
Zoe was closer to Ted than any of us.

32:45.492 --> 32:47.361
She should have a chance to speak.

32:50.998 --> 32:52.607
What do I think?

32:53.041 --> 32:56.701
Anyone who endangers the group
is thrown out!

32:56.803 --> 32:59.553
- Are those the rules, or aren't they?
- This is insane.

32:59.605 --> 33:01.040
I say we put it to a vote!

33:01.107 --> 33:02.608
Maybe we should wait...

33:03.713 --> 33:05.436
until the police get here.

33:05.587 --> 33:06.788
The police?

33:07.295 --> 33:09.912
That's who you're waiting for?
You want to wait for your dad?

33:10.016 --> 33:11.884
Well, tell me, what would he
do if he were here?

33:11.951 --> 33:13.986
Because the Officer Heisel
I know isn't a pussy like you.

33:14.053 --> 33:16.133
This should be decided by all of us.

33:16.393 --> 33:18.161
We put it to a vote, okay?

33:21.627 --> 33:26.535
Everyone in favor of forgiving
Vic for violating the rules,

33:26.791 --> 33:28.496
please raise your hands.

33:33.626 --> 33:36.165
All those in favor
of expelling Vic from the mall,

33:36.688 --> 33:39.376
per the rules
as agreed upon by the group.

33:45.450 --> 33:46.718
You're killing me.

33:50.450 --> 33:51.991
Would you grab
a hiking pack from the store

33:52.058 --> 33:53.359
and gather Vic's things for him?

33:54.573 --> 33:57.297
Put together, uh,
three days' provisions,

33:58.172 --> 34:01.461
a flashlight, and a means
of defending himself.

34:17.329 --> 34:18.617
Hello.

34:18.899 --> 34:20.531
There...

34:21.431 --> 34:24.456
Natalie, please. You're scaring my wife.

34:24.524 --> 34:27.097
Oh, please don't be afraid.

34:27.425 --> 34:29.027
I know these creatures.

34:29.063 --> 34:30.518
They would never harm us.

34:30.589 --> 34:32.090
You saw what happened to Mikhail.

34:32.297 --> 34:34.067
I'm sure it had a reason.

34:34.331 --> 34:36.793
Have you ever experienced nature
not having a reason?

34:37.469 --> 34:39.338
Mother Earth is never wrong.

34:39.405 --> 34:41.063
She knows what she's doing,

34:41.328 --> 34:43.571
and so will we if we observe her.

34:44.277 --> 34:46.649
Father, I... I beg you,

34:46.985 --> 34:49.815
the Bible warns
about the false prophets.

34:49.882 --> 34:53.085
She's worshipping a false god
in your church.

34:54.587 --> 34:56.188
I can't reach her.

34:57.590 --> 34:59.325
When you met me, I was unreachable.

35:03.496 --> 35:04.831
That was different.

35:04.897 --> 35:07.185
You knew exactly what you were doing.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.502
I'm sure to an outsider,
it would've looked cruel...

35:11.304 --> 35:13.429
but you reached me.

35:14.202 --> 35:18.804
Father, you reached me.

35:37.764 --> 35:40.057
I know that this may seem harsh,

35:41.257 --> 35:44.130
but if I can save your soul,
it will be worth it.

35:45.705 --> 35:47.474
I need you to kill the spider.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.361
I will do no such thing.

35:49.415 --> 35:53.736
Please. Kill the spider.

35:54.228 --> 35:56.677
- Save yourself.
- I will not kill her.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.552
Mrs. Raven, I'm not punishing you.

35:58.654 --> 36:00.326
I am trying to help you.

36:00.834 --> 36:05.388
Now, please kill the spider.

36:05.451 --> 36:06.759
Absolutely not!

36:06.826 --> 36:08.693
No! No!

36:09.037 --> 36:09.971
Please!

36:10.163 --> 36:12.615
No! No!

36:55.041 --> 36:56.576
Jay, come on. You were accused, too.

36:56.609 --> 36:58.383
They didn't throw you out.
I made a mistake.

36:58.408 --> 37:01.114
Everyone makes mistakes.
This isn't right! Please!

37:01.180 --> 37:02.419
This is what we voted for.

37:03.216 --> 37:05.372
We have to be safe in here.

37:06.052 --> 37:07.787
Get your hands off me! Let me go!

37:30.777 --> 37:32.145
Fuck you!

37:32.531 --> 37:34.400
Fuck all of you!

37:41.054 --> 37:44.990
I know that my actions today

37:45.615 --> 37:48.545
appeared cold and callous,

37:49.170 --> 37:52.577
but I beg of you to understand
that they are the opposite,

37:53.499 --> 37:55.170
that they are an act of charity,

37:56.202 --> 38:01.240
of helping a lost soul
find her way to Heaven.

38:01.307 --> 38:02.942
You asked me
what I thought was happening.

38:03.377 --> 38:04.777
I'm not asking anymore.

38:10.316 --> 38:11.684
I would like to answer.

38:11.971 --> 38:13.281
We're not interested.

38:28.722 --> 38:32.535
No one is interested!

38:35.208 --> 38:36.477
I am.

38:46.853 --> 38:48.154
I am.

39:21.587 --> 39:23.356
That's okay.

39:24.690 --> 39:26.359
I lied.

39:28.194 --> 39:29.629
What do you mean?

39:31.030 --> 39:32.579
I didn't fight.

39:33.025 --> 39:34.509
I didn't do anything.

39:34.667 --> 39:36.798
I just waited for it to kill me.

39:37.283 --> 39:40.329
It came, it looked at me, and it left.

39:44.845 --> 39:46.807
Why did't it want me?

40:06.733 --> 40:08.234
Shelley, I'm so sorry.

40:09.865 --> 40:11.833
I don't want to be
with those people anymore.

40:12.502 --> 40:13.798
You can stay here.

40:14.719 --> 40:16.988
Kyle, will you get
a blanket for Shelley?

40:17.375 --> 40:19.010
Here. You can have mine.

40:22.982 --> 40:24.417
Thanks.

40:34.167 --> 40:35.435
You were right.

40:36.025 --> 40:37.717
Alex is a liar.

40:45.831 --> 40:47.231
We need to go.

40:47.801 --> 40:49.520
I need to look for my son.

40:49.728 --> 40:54.728
Come with us.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.121
You should get in the car now.

40:56.159 --> 40:57.179
Clay.

40:58.870 --> 41:00.448
He's out there.

41:01.268 --> 41:02.736
I know it.

41:05.654 --> 41:07.122
Okay.
