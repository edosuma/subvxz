AND IF THAT PRINTOUT
EVEN EXISTS,

08:25.776 --> 08:27.778
THERE'S NO MORE VALIDITY
TO THE ACCUSATIONS NOW

08:27.778 --> 08:30.711
THAN THERE WAS
18 YEARS AGO.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.582
WHAT I HAVE IS A VIDEO

08:32.582 --> 08:34.815
OF YOUR MURDERED HENCHMAN,
FRANK STEVENS,

08:34.815 --> 08:37.788
TOSSING SAID SOCIALITE
OFF A BUILDING,

08:37.788 --> 08:40.551
NOT TO MENTION
AN INCRIMINATING CONVERSATION

08:40.551 --> 08:41.852
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR...

08:41.852 --> 08:43.654
WHORE

08:43.654 --> 08:46.697
ABOUT YOUR COMPLICITY
IN FRAMING DAVID CLARKE.

08:46.697 --> 08:50.530
AND I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE
THIS VIDEO WITH YOU.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.803
OH, I WOULDN'T BE
THAT RECKLESS.

08:52.803 --> 08:56.536
NO. WE HAVE SOME NEGOTIATING
TO DO FIRST.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.570
NOW... WHY DON'T YOU
MAKE ME YOUR BEST OFFER?

08:59.570 --> 09:02.613
AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
ABOUT KEEPING THAT RECORDING

09:02.613 --> 09:05.916
OUT OF THE HANDS
OF FEDERAL PROSECUTORS.

09:05.916 --> 09:09.680
YOU REALLY ARE SON OF A BITCH,
AREN'T YOU?

09:09.680 --> 09:11.752
YES.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.554
IT DOES APPEAR
THAT YOU DESPICABLE PEOPLE

09:14.554 --> 09:16.787
ARE STARTING TO RUB OFF
ON ME.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.666
♪♪♪

09:32.843 --> 09:33.974
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT,
AFTER THIS INITIAL MEETING,

09:33.974 --> 09:35.075
CONRAD HAS NO INTENTION

09:35.075 --> 09:37.878
OF SIMPLY HANDING OVER
WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.980
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED
FOR THIS TO PROCEED TO TRIAL.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.112
NO. WE'LL HANDLE
THIS MATTER PRIVATELY.

09:42.112 --> 09:45.085
THEN YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER
WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE UP

09:45.085 --> 09:46.817
TO AVOID THAT EVENTUALITY.

09:46.817 --> 09:49.059
(scoffs) I'VE ALREADY
GIVEN UP FAR TOO MUCH.

09:49.059 --> 09:51.091
WELL, I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T
HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.093
IF TALKS BREAK DOWN
IN MEDIATION,

09:53.093 --> 09:55.996
OUR BEST CHANCE
AT DEFEATING CONRAD WILL BE

09:55.996 --> 09:57.898
TO EXPOSE HIS INFIDELITIES
IN OPEN COURT.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.100
THIS IS A POINT YOU'VE MADE
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.032
THERE ARE
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.

10:02.032 --> 10:03.103
WHAT,

10:03.103 --> 10:05.135
CHARLOTTE AND DANIEL?

10:05.135 --> 10:08.078
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT OPPOSING
COUNSEL IS COUNTING ON--

10:08.078 --> 10:11.812
YOUR MATERNAL INSTINCTS WORKING
AGAINST YOUR SELF-INTEREST.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.043
YOU'RE PLAYING
RIGHT INTO THEIR HANDS.

10:13.043 --> 10:15.886
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY
TO LOSE A CHILD IN A DIVORCE.

10:15.886 --> 10:17.147
(sighs)

10:17.147 --> 10:19.990
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LOSE ANYTHING.

10:19.990 --> 10:22.853
I HAPPEN TO BE QUITE GOOD
AT WHAT I DO, VICTORIA,

10:22.853 --> 10:25.826
BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
UNLESS YOU START TRUSTING ME.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.828
YOU SAID YOU WERE WILLING
TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.800
WELL, THAT TIME
IS FAST APPROACHING.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.132
MY HANDS ARE ALREADY DIRTY.

10:32.132 --> 10:36.006
THAT PRENUP I SIGNED
BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED?

10:36.006 --> 10:37.868
I LIED.

10:37.868 --> 10:40.040
I WASN'T REALLY PREGNANT
WHEN I SIGNED IT.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.842
THE CONTRACT IS VALID.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.144
(clock ticking)

10:44.144 --> 10:46.176
AND AS FAR AS CONRAD KNOWS?

10:46.176 --> 10:48.118
I MISCARRIED AT TEN WEEKS.

10:48.118 --> 10:50.821
THAT'S EXACTLY
THE KINDS OF SECRETS

10:50.821 --> 10:53.854
YOU AGREED
NOT TO KEEP FROM ME.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.186
(doorbell rings)

10:56.186 --> 10:58.929
I'LL CALL YOU LATER
IN THE DAY.

10:58.929 --> 11:00.160
(door opens)

11:07.197 --> 11:09.900
I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU DROPPED
MY FATHER'S APPEAL.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.872
I'M SORRY, MS. CLARKE,

11:11.872 --> 11:13.073
THAT'S PRIVILEGED INFORMATION.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.906
NOT ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD,

11:15.906 --> 11:18.048
BUT MY FATHER
WAS MURDERED IN PRISON.

11:18.048 --> 11:20.050
AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU'RE JUST AS GUILTY

11:20.050 --> 11:21.882
AS THE MAN
WHO STABBED HIM TO DEATH.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.014
(sighs)

11:24.014 --> 11:25.085
WHAT IS THAT?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.216
EVERY BIT OF EVIDENCE
YOU COULD'VE USED

11:26.216 --> 11:28.859
TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.193
THEY GOT TO YOU,
DIDN'T THEY?

11:38.098 --> 11:40.931
VICTORIA.

11:40.931 --> 11:43.133
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR DANIEL,
I THOUGHT HE WAS WITH YOU.

11:43.133 --> 11:45.135
NO. ACTUALLY,
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

11:45.135 --> 11:46.937
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
HELP ME FIND A PHOTO

11:46.937 --> 11:48.979
THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHER TOOK
OF ME AND DANIEL

11:48.979 --> 11:51.011
ON THE BOW OF THE YACHT
AT YOUR MEMORIAL DAY PARTY.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.013
IT'S OUR FIRST PICTURE
THAT WE TOOK TOGETHER,

11:53.013 --> 11:55.115
AND, UM, WELL, I'M MAKING
A SUMMER SCRAPBOOK

11:55.115 --> 11:56.246
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

11:56.246 --> 11:58.018
AREN'T YOU INVENTIVE?

11:58.018 --> 11:59.950
WELL, WHAT DO YOU GET THE GUY
WHO HAS EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

11:59.950 --> 12:02.052
AND DANIEL REALLY WANTED
TO KEEP IT SIMPLE, SO...

12:02.052 --> 12:04.154
WELL, IT DOESN'T GET
MUCH SIMPLER THAN A CLAMBAKE.

12:04.154 --> 12:07.227
I'LL HAVE ASHLEY DIG UP
THE EVENT PHOTOGRAPHER'S NUMBER.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.899
THAT'S ASSUMING
THAT SHE'S NOT TOO BUSY

12:08.899 --> 12:10.230
HELPING OUT
WITH DANIEL'S PARTY.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.033
ACTUALLY, SHE'S RECRUITED
SOME OF HER OWN HELP FOR THAT--

12:13.033 --> 12:14.905
JACK PORTER
AND AMANDA CLARKE.

12:14.905 --> 12:15.966
OH?

12:15.966 --> 12:17.167
AMANDA IS THE LITTLE GIRL

12:17.167 --> 12:19.239
WHO LIVED IN MY COTTAGE
BACK IN THE EARLY '90s.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.242
DANIEL TELLS ME THAT HER FATHER
WORKED FOR CONRAD'S COMPANY

12:22.242 --> 12:23.914
BEFORE HE--

12:23.914 --> 12:25.045
YES,
IT WAS A HORRIBLE TIME.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.047
DO YOU REMEMBER AMANDA
AT ALL?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.019
VAGUELY.

12:29.019 --> 12:30.921
POOR DEAR.

12:30.921 --> 12:32.052
(clock continues ticking)

12:32.052 --> 12:34.254
WELL,
IF IT ISN'T TOO AWKWARD,

12:34.254 --> 12:36.286
I WAS THINKING
OF INVITING THEM TO STAY

12:36.286 --> 12:38.128
AFTER THE PARTY SET UP.

12:38.128 --> 12:40.130
JACK'S BECOME
A VERY GOOD FRIEND,

12:40.130 --> 12:42.132
AND, WELL, AMANDA LOOKS LIKE
SHE COULD USE ONE, SO--

12:42.132 --> 12:44.134
WELL, IT SOUNDS AS IF
YOUR MIND IS ALREADY MADE UP.

12:44.134 --> 12:45.966
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING
TO GET IN YOUR WAY.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.968
DO YOU MIND IF I GRAB
DANIEL'S SQUASH RACKET

12:47.968 --> 12:49.199
FROM THE POOL HOUSE
FOR HIM?

12:49.199 --> 12:50.270
OF COURSE.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.072
I'M SURE YOU KNOW
THE WAY BY NOW.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.104
THANKS.

12:54.104 --> 12:57.007
(clock continues ticking)

12:57.007 --> 13:00.010
HEY. ANY LUCK
DRYING OUT YOUR COMPUTER?

13:00.010 --> 13:01.251
(Nolan) Back online, baby.

13:01.251 --> 13:02.983
Shamu...

13:02.983 --> 13:07.988
WILL BE LIVE IN 3, 2, 1.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.059
AHH.

13:09.059 --> 13:10.120
Anything?

13:10.120 --> 13:12.092
IT'S HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT,
DORA.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.064
I'm guessing backpack,
duffel bag,

13:14.064 --> 13:16.296
ON THE FLOOR,
NORTHWEST CORNER--

13:16.296 --> 13:18.999
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
TURN 10 DEGREES TO YOUR RIGHT.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.030
Walk forward.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.179
GOT IT.

13:29.179 --> 13:31.181
THANKS.
 (cell phone beeps)

13:31.181 --> 13:33.183
(tablet beeping)

13:33.183 --> 13:35.185
HIT THE ROAD, BABE.

13:35.185 --> 13:37.187
TYLER'S 30 METERS OUT.

13:37.187 --> 13:38.989
EMILY?

13:47.197 --> 13:49.259
(keypad beeps)

13:49.259 --> 13:51.161
(phone rings)

13:51.161 --> 13:52.362
(man) Dr. Kutsch's office.

13:52.362 --> 13:54.364
HI, THIS IS
DR. MICHELLE BANKS.

13:54.364 --> 13:58.138
I AM TREATING A PATIENT
OF DR. KUTSCH'S

13:58.138 --> 14:01.271
AND, UH, I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS
HIS CASE WITH HIM.

14:01.271 --> 14:04.174
I'm afraid Dr. Kutsch
is still on leave of absence

14:04.174 --> 14:05.315
after the attack.

14:05.315 --> 14:07.117
Uh, what's the patient's name?

14:07.117 --> 14:08.318
TYLER BARROL.

14:08.318 --> 14:11.021
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you
mind holding a minute?

14:11.021 --> 14:13.023
I'm gonna connect you
with the detective.

14:13.023 --> 14:16.226
They've been searching for
Tyler Barrol for several weeks.

14:16.226 --> 14:18.028
YEAH. I DON'T MIND HOLDING.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.271
AH, COME ON. COME ON.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.103
(objects clatter)

14:33.103 --> 14:36.046
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
WHERE IS IT?

14:36.046 --> 14:37.147
COME ON.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.383
DAMN IT!

14:45.415 --> 14:47.087
(Tyler grunts)

14:47.087 --> 14:49.059
(clattering)

14:56.266 --> 14:57.427
(glass shatters)

15:06.276 --> 15:07.337
THIS IS A SERIOUS
ANTIPSYCHOTIC.

15:07.337 --> 15:08.408
IT SAYS IF YOU STOP
TAKING IT ABRUPTLY,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.310
IT CAN CAUSE
A VIOLENT REBOUND EFFECT.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.412
MM. COLD TURKEY
MEETS HOT MESS.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.414
SOMETHING I'M SURE
TYLER'S PSYCHIATRIST

15:14.414 --> 15:16.416
WOULD BE HAPPY
TO TESTIFY TO.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.149
YEAH, IF HIS JAW
WEREN'T WIRED SHUT.

15:19.149 --> 15:21.191
W-WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH SHAMU?

15:21.191 --> 15:22.322
HE'S ON MY MANTEL.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.324
I THOUGHT YOU COULD HELP ME
KEEP AN EYE ON THE PLACE

15:24.324 --> 15:26.126
IN CASE TYLER
GOES AFTER DANIEL.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.257
AWW.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.259
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

15:29.259 --> 15:30.360
(computer chirps)

15:30.360 --> 15:31.501
AND WE'RE IN.

15:31.501 --> 15:34.234
S.F.P.D. DATABASE.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.406
DR. KUTSCH WAS ATTACKED
MAY 22nd.

15:36.406 --> 15:38.508
THAT'S ONLY A FEW WEEKS
BEFORE TYLER SHOWED UP HERE.

15:38.508 --> 15:41.341
ONLY CONTACT, FAMILY--

15:41.341 --> 15:42.472
ALEXANDER BARROL.

15:42.472 --> 15:44.214
IS THAT HIS FATHER?

15:44.214 --> 15:45.275
MORE LIKE HIS BROTHER.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.346
LET'S SEE...
 (chirps)

15:46.346 --> 15:48.378
35,
WORKS AS A TRAUMA SURGEON

15:48.378 --> 15:50.280
AT SAN FRANCISCO
MEDICAL CENTER.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.481
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S BYPASS THE POLICE.

15:51.481 --> 15:53.183
GO STRAIGHT TO HIS FAMILY.

15:53.183 --> 15:54.524
THEY'LL ASK FEWER QUESTIONS.

15:54.524 --> 15:56.526
WHERE'S TYLER NOW?

15:56.526 --> 15:58.428
(beeping)

15:58.428 --> 16:00.330
STILL IN THE POOL HOUSE.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.162
CALL HIS BROTHER.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.293
SEE IF YOU CAN GET HIM

16:03.293 --> 16:04.494
TO COME GET HIM
BEFORE HE HURTS ANYBODY.

16:04.494 --> 16:07.497
(keypad beeping)

16:09.199 --> 16:10.240
(phone rings)

16:10.240 --> 16:11.301
(clears throat)

16:11.301 --> 16:12.372
(line clicks)

16:12.372 --> 16:13.443
(man) Hello.

16:13.443 --> 16:14.544
IS THIS, UH,
ALEXANDER BARROL?

16:14.544 --> 16:16.206
YEAH, WHO'S THIS?

16:16.206 --> 16:18.178
Nolan Ross here,
calling from the Hamptons.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.281
WE'RE HAVING A SITUATION
WITH YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.412
YOU FOUND TY?

16:22.412 --> 16:24.184
More like he found us.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.355
AND HE'S OFF HIS MEDS.

16:25.355 --> 16:27.357
OKAY. LISTEN, TY CAN BE
VERY UNPREDICTABLE

16:27.357 --> 16:29.189
WHEN HE'S OFF HIS MEDICATION.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.460
WE'RE FIGURING THAT OUT.

16:30.460 --> 16:31.521
Keep him calm

16:31.521 --> 16:33.393
A-AND TRY NOT TO UPSET HIM
UNTIL I GET THERE.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.195
I'LL BOOK A FLIGHT TOMORROW--

16:35.195 --> 16:37.397
NO, NO, NO.
TOMORROW IS TOO LATE, DOC.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.569
I'M GONNA HAVE A JET FUELED UP,
WAITING FOR YOU AT S.F.O.

16:39.569 --> 16:41.431
IT'LL GET YOU HERE
BY NIGHTFALL.

16:41.431 --> 16:44.504
OR I COULD HAND HIM OVER
TO THE POLICE.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.377
LET ME GET THERE FIRST.
HE NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION.

16:47.377 --> 16:48.578
I'm on my way
to the airport now.

16:48.578 --> 16:50.380
PERFECT. THANKS.

16:50.380 --> 16:51.411
(beep)

16:51.411 --> 16:52.512
(clatters)

16:52.512 --> 16:54.544
(beeps)

16:54.544 --> 16:56.346
(knock on door)

16:56.346 --> 16:58.388
(knock)

17:02.422 --> 17:03.493
WHERE'S CHARLOTTE?

17:03.493 --> 17:05.494
OH, SHE WENT TO BUY
A PRESENT FOR DANIEL.

17:05.494 --> 17:06.596
(inhales deeply)

17:06.596 --> 17:08.298
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN?

17:08.298 --> 17:10.260
THANK YOU.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.237
TYLER IS BLACKMAILING ME.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.308
WHAT?

17:18.308 --> 17:19.569
CLAIMS TO HAVE A COPY
OF THAT

17:19.569 --> 17:22.412
INDICTING SPEECH LYDIA WAS
PLANNING TO DELIVER AGAINST US

17:22.412 --> 17:24.444
AT THAT INFERNAL BENEFIT.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.316
IMPOSSIBLE. I SHREDDED IT.

17:26.316 --> 17:28.348
HE ALSO CLAIMS TO HAVE
ALL THE VIDEO FOOTAGE

17:28.348 --> 17:31.451
FROM LYDIA'S LOFT THE NIGHT
FRANK NEARLY KILLED HER.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.523
TYLER'S BEHIND IT?

17:33.523 --> 17:35.325
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

17:35.325 --> 17:38.388
NEITHER DID I, UNTIL I CALLED
THE DEAN OF HARVARD BUSINESS.

17:38.388 --> 17:40.390
IT TURNS OUT,

17:40.390 --> 17:43.463
TYLER ISN'T EVEN ENROLLED.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.336
HIS FAMILY
QUIT PAYING HIS TUITION

17:46.336 --> 17:47.637
LAST FALL.

17:47.637 --> 17:50.470
ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE'VE BEEN
VICTIMS OF AN EXTORTION PLOT

17:50.470 --> 17:53.273
FROM THE MOMENT THAT TYLER
SET FOOT IN OUR HOUSE?

17:53.273 --> 17:54.574
OH, IT WAS
LONG BEFORE THAT.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.477
NO, I'M THINKING,
HE COULD'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS

17:57.477 --> 18:00.310
FROM THE DAY HE SET HIS SIGHTS
ON OUR SON.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.485
OH, GREAT. THE TENT'S BEEN
CONFIRMED FOR THE BEACH.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.517
TENT? I THOUGHT WE WERE
KEEPING THIS SMALL.

18:07.517 --> 18:09.459
AND COZY. YOU'LL LOVE IT.

18:09.459 --> 18:11.621
OH, MY GOD. I AM SO GLAD
YOU GUYS ARE HERE.

18:11.621 --> 18:12.662
WHAT'S WRONG?

18:12.662 --> 18:14.464
I HAD A RUN-IN WITH TYLER.

18:14.464 --> 18:15.665
THAT'S HARDLY
WHAT I'D CALL NEWS.

18:15.665 --> 18:17.627
NO, THIS IS DIFFERENT. THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.

18:17.627 --> 18:19.529
I FOUND THIS
IN THE POOL HOUSE.

18:19.529 --> 18:21.571
ANTIPSYCHOTICS?

18:21.571 --> 18:22.672
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

18:22.672 --> 18:24.674
I THINK HE'S GONE OFF THEM.
HE TRASHED THE PLACE.

18:24.674 --> 18:26.476
I'M GOING OVER THERE.

18:26.476 --> 18:27.677
BE CAREFUL.
I'M GONNA COME WITH YOU.

18:27.677 --> 18:29.439
SO WILL I.

18:29.439 --> 18:30.610
NO, NO, STAY HERE.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.342
IT'S MY FAULT HE'S HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE, OKAY?

18:32.342 --> 18:34.444
I'M SORRY, ASH. (sighs)

SINCE THE DAY WE MET.

36:15.344 --> 36:16.605
NOW YOU CAN SEE HOW IT FEELS.

36:16.605 --> 36:17.676
TYLER, BUDDY,
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.548
SHUT UP, DANNY!

36:19.548 --> 36:21.350
YOU MADE IT CLEAR

36:21.350 --> 36:23.612
THAT I'MNOTYOUR BUDDY,
AND NOW...

36:23.612 --> 36:26.685
YOU'RE ON THE LOSING END
OF THINGS FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.488
TYLER, I BEG OF YOU,
DON'T HURT MY CHILDREN.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.461
PLEASE THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

36:32.461 --> 36:35.394
OH, BELIEVE ME, I--
I HAVE.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.566
AND THIS TIME, THE GRAYSONS
AREN'T THE ONES

36:37.566 --> 36:39.598
CALLING THE SHOTS.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.470
NOW...

36:41.470 --> 36:43.572
HOW ABOUT A PARTY GAME, HUH?

36:43.572 --> 36:46.475
SOMETHING WE CAN ALL PLAY.

36:46.475 --> 36:47.676
LET'S CALL IT...

36:47.676 --> 36:52.381
TRUTH OR DIE.

36:52.381 --> 36:54.583
I ASK A QUESTION,
AND YOU TELL THE TRUTH.

36:54.583 --> 36:57.746
IF YOU DON'T...

36:57.746 --> 36:59.618
SOMEONE DIES.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.390
(Conrad)
TYLER, BE REASONABLE.

37:01.390 --> 37:03.522
YOU'RE NOT SHOOTING ANYONE.

37:03.522 --> 37:06.725
OKAY, CONNY,
YOU'RE UP FIRST.

37:08.527 --> 37:10.629
NOW LET'S TAKE IT
ALL THE WAY BACK

37:10.629 --> 37:14.533
TO DAVID CLARKE
AND THE SUMMER OF '93.

37:14.533 --> 37:17.706
YOU HAVE THREE SECONDS
TO TELL EVERYONE THE TRUTH

37:17.706 --> 37:21.440
ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
TO DAVID CLARKE.

37:25.574 --> 37:26.745
CLOCK'S TICKING, CONRAD.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.746
TYLER, PLEASE.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.679
DO IT!

37:30.679 --> 37:32.551
OR I SWEAR,

37:32.551 --> 37:35.424
ONCE AGAIN,
SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE

37:35.424 --> 37:37.656
BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO WEAK

37:37.656 --> 37:40.629
TO OWN UP TO YOUR LIES.

37:40.629 --> 37:42.731
QUESTION IS, WHO?

37:42.731 --> 37:45.534
(lowered voice) WHY DON'T YOU
CALM DOWN, SON?

37:45.534 --> 37:46.735
THIS DOESN'T INVOLVE THEM.

37:46.735 --> 37:48.637
WRONG ANSWER.

37:52.701 --> 37:54.643
(cocks gun)

37:56.505 --> 37:58.807
(Alexander) TYLER?

38:01.650 --> 38:02.811
ALEX...

38:02.811 --> 38:05.554
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:05.554 --> 38:08.487
I HADN'T HEARD FROM YOU
IN A WHILE.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.658
I WAS WORRIED.

38:09.658 --> 38:10.789
WE ALL WERE.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.791
(chuckles)

38:12.791 --> 38:16.625
MOM AND DAD DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME. THEY CUT ME OFF.

38:16.625 --> 38:18.827
AND YOU'RE JUST HERE
SO THEY CAN LOCK ME UP AGAIN.

38:18.827 --> 38:21.770
NO, NO, THAT--
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

38:21.770 --> 38:23.772
MOM AND DAD WANT TO
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

38:25.774 --> 38:28.477
COME ON.

38:28.477 --> 38:31.780
LET'S GO TALK ABOUT IT,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

38:34.543 --> 38:35.584
(grunts)

38:35.584 --> 38:36.615
OHH!

38:36.615 --> 38:37.846
GET OFF OF ME!
LET ME GO!

38:37.846 --> 38:39.588
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
 UGH!

38:42.851 --> 38:44.693
(Conrad)
I RECOGNIZE THAT WALLET.

38:44.693 --> 38:46.795
I BOUGHT IT FOR FRANK
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

38:46.795 --> 38:49.658
(indistinct conversations)

38:49.658 --> 38:51.700
(police radio chatter)

38:51.700 --> 38:53.702
(speaks indistinctly)
 ALL RIGHT.

38:53.702 --> 38:57.506
(indistinct conversations
continue)

38:57.506 --> 38:59.838
SO THEY FOUND FRANK'S WALLET
IN TYLER'S JACKET.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.510
WHAT?

39:01.510 --> 39:02.711
YEAH, AND HE'S NOW

39:02.711 --> 39:05.874
THE PRIME SUSPECT IN THEIR
MURDER INVESTIGATION,

39:05.874 --> 39:08.517
WHICH MEANS I'M NO LONGER
IN THEIR CROSSHAIRS,

39:08.517 --> 39:10.849
WHICH ALSO MEANS THAT YOU
AND THAT LAWYER OF YOURS

39:10.849 --> 39:13.852
CAN HAVE THE BATTLE ROYALE
YOU'VE BEEN GUNNING FOR.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.654
YOU BETTER BUCKLE UP.

39:15.654 --> 39:16.725

39:27.566 --> 39:28.697

39:28.697 --> 39:30.669

FOR EVERYTHING.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.671
I FOUND IT INTERESTING
THAT THE POLICE

39:32.671 --> 39:35.744
DIDN'T FIND ANY BULLETS
IN THE GUN...

39:35.744 --> 39:37.746
YOUR GUN.

39:37.746 --> 39:40.809
I THOUGHT YOU ALWAYS
KEPT THAT THING LOADED.

39:40.809 --> 39:42.611
NOT ALWAYS.

39:42.611 --> 39:44.913
YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE
AND...

39:44.913 --> 39:47.756
TERRIFY ME, MAESTRO.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.761

39:52.761 --> 39:53.922
I'M SO SORRY, ASH.

39:53.922 --> 39:55.824
YEAH, ME, TOO.

39:55.824 --> 39:57.696
WOW, THAT WAS FUN.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.768
