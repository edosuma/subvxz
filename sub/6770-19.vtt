00:04.204 --> 00:06.639
WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Esterman
to Radiology, Dr. Mark Esterman

00:06.705 --> 00:08.208
to Radiology.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.276
(phone ringing)

00:12.645 --> 00:14.114
Hello.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.548
David, hi. It's me.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.785
What's up? You okay?

00:18.852 --> 00:21.588
Noah's hurt. I'm calling you
from the emergency room.

00:21.654 --> 00:23.757
What's going... what's going on?

00:23.823 --> 00:26.126
It's Donna.
Noah's in the hospital.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.260
Is that Camille?

00:27.327 --> 00:29.362
Yeah. What's going on with Noah?

00:29.429 --> 00:32.098
Well, I ignored his calls
like you told me to do,

00:32.165 --> 00:34.234
and I guess he got drunk
and he broke in,

00:34.300 --> 00:35.735
and we all thought
he was a burglar, and...

00:35.802 --> 00:38.171
-and Matt went after him.
-You're kidding.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.039
So far, he has a concussion
and some bruised ribs.

00:40.106 --> 00:41.508
We're waiting for some tests,
but if they're clear,

00:41.574 --> 00:43.209
I'm just gonna take him
back to my place.

00:43.276 --> 00:46.246
No, Donna, if the guy
broke into your house

00:46.312 --> 00:49.382
'cause he couldn't get you on
the phone, you need some space.

00:49.449 --> 00:51.351
David, I don't need
your second-guessing right now.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.253
I just called
because you're his roommate.

00:53.319 --> 00:54.788
I thought you might
worry about him.

00:54.854 --> 00:57.757
Uh, I'll... I got to go.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.226
-(dial tone drones)
-(groans)

01:00.293 --> 01:01.261
(beep)

01:01.327 --> 01:02.662
The CAT scan came back fine.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.797
No cranial bleeding.

01:03.863 --> 01:06.299
He may experience some nausea

01:06.366 --> 01:07.700
over the next eight hours,

01:07.767 --> 01:08.835
and breathing won't tickle.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.470
Just keep an eye on him.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.172
Thanks.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.109
DONNA:
I, uh, was just calling David.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.278
I told him we'll be taking care
of Noah for a few days.

01:18.344 --> 01:19.446
We are?

01:19.512 --> 01:21.347
Mm-hmm.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.751
Okay, uh, I'm gonna
go get the car.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.787
(quietly):
Okay.

01:27.854 --> 01:30.356
Matt feels... awful.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.091
Well, he shouldn't.

01:32.158 --> 01:34.394
I guess you're right.

01:34.461 --> 01:37.764
Look, I know on principle you
could do without Noah around.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.799
Right again.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.267
But he needs a friend.

01:41.334 --> 01:44.137
How are you guys supposed
to get past things

01:44.204 --> 01:45.205
if he is sleeping

01:45.271 --> 01:46.406
on our couch?

01:46.473 --> 01:48.374
Kel, David already
gave me the lecture,

01:48.441 --> 01:49.776
and I appreciate your concern,

01:49.843 --> 01:52.545
but no one has anything
to worry about, especially me.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.180
All right.

01:54.247 --> 01:56.249
I'll hold you to that.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.518
I'll hold myself to that.
Thanks.

Hey.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.439
-Hey.
-I tried to call,

03:59.505 --> 04:01.474
but the operator said
your line was busy.

04:01.541 --> 04:02.942
Yeah. Um, come here.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.544
Look at this.

04:04.611 --> 04:05.878
What is all this?

04:05.945 --> 04:07.814
Well, it's detective work.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.749
Steve and I have
been online all night

04:09.816 --> 04:12.986
trying to get the phone numbers
of the people on this list here.

04:13.052 --> 04:15.254
Dylan, your dad's name
wasn't on that list.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.358
No, Jack McKay isn't,
but, uh, Eddie Waitkus--

04:18.423 --> 04:21.427
that's the name of a guy in
a story my dad used to tell me,

04:21.494 --> 04:22.795
and it's no coincidence.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.664
If he's alive,
that's the name he's using.

04:24.731 --> 04:26.432
-What did you find out?
-Not much.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.401
The people on the plane,
they don't remember him.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.269
What can I do?
How can I help?

04:30.336 --> 04:31.437
I don't know you can.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.572
I'm beginning to think

04:32.639 --> 04:33.773
that somebody or something

04:33.840 --> 04:36.476
does not want this little
family reunion to take place.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.745
-We can go back to the FBI.
-Oh, why?

04:38.811 --> 04:40.947
They lied to me once;
their story isn't changing.

04:41.014 --> 04:41.914
I mean, what... what if...

04:41.981 --> 04:44.283
what if he's trying
to send me a message,

04:44.350 --> 04:45.952
and this is as close
as he can get?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.287
Have you tried the flight crew?
Maybe they would be

04:48.354 --> 04:50.289
more apt to remember someone.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.725
(quietly):
Yeah.

04:55.061 --> 04:56.329
(line rings)

04:56.396 --> 04:57.830
WOMAN:
Directory assistance.

04:57.897 --> 05:01.334
Yeah, give me, uh,
World Continental Airlines.

05:08.374 --> 05:09.976
Hey.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.045
-(groans)
-Be careful.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.684
Oh, man, I smell
your burnt toast.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.319
Hey, I tried to scrape
most of the black stuff off.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.521
It's okay, I kind of

05:21.587 --> 05:24.390
acquired a taste for it
over the years.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.863
Oh, man, Kelly and Matt
must hate me.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.432
Matt feels very guilty.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.835
And... Kelly's just Kelly--
she'll cool down.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.336
Aren't you hungry?

05:37.403 --> 05:39.605
-No, uh-uh.
-Oh, you should try

05:39.672 --> 05:40.807
to eat a little bit.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.076
Your ribs could be sore
for a couple days.

05:43.142 --> 05:44.644
All right.

05:44.711 --> 05:45.812
Wait, wait.

05:45.878 --> 05:46.946
Okay.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.015
Just a small bite.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.484
There.

05:51.551 --> 05:53.720
(sighs) Oh, man, I don't
know what hurts worse,

05:53.786 --> 05:56.122
my ribs or watching you
take care of me like this.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.957
I want to.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.026
Besides, I have Camille
covering the store,

06:00.093 --> 06:02.762
so I have plenty
of time on my hands.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.097
Another bite?

06:04.163 --> 06:06.365
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

06:07.166 --> 06:10.069
Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.071
I guess I had to see you.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.806
Why?

06:13.873 --> 06:15.975
Who knows?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.977
I was drunk.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.012
Noah, you have
to get back into AA.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.519
(sighs)

06:28.688 --> 06:30.056
I'm serious.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.125
Noah, you-you...

06:32.191 --> 06:33.226
promise and you promise,

06:33.292 --> 06:36.095
then somehow you always
find reasons to fall short.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.098
You do it again,
you're on your own.

06:51.177 --> 06:52.812
Steve-o, you ready
for spr... Oh.

06:52.879 --> 06:53.946
God, I'm sorry.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.082
I thought you were Steve.
I'm Ryan.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.450
Hi. I'm Janet.

06:57.517 --> 06:58.618
Hey, well, it's good
to finally meet you.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.853
-You, too.
-Uh, the front door was locked,

07:00.920 --> 07:02.989
so I thought I'd come around
and surprise him.

07:03.055 --> 07:04.991
Oh, well, you got me instead.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.993
Um, he's at the office,
but he'll be back

07:07.059 --> 07:09.896
-in a couple of minutes.
-(Madeline cooing)

07:11.063 --> 07:13.166
Wow.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.572
RYAN:
This is realism defined.

07:19.639 --> 07:20.506
I've never had a niece before.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.508
You go away to school
for eight months,

07:22.575 --> 07:23.509
and things kind of change, huh?

07:23.576 --> 07:25.011
Yeah. (laughs)

07:26.045 --> 07:27.513
JANET:
So, um...

07:27.580 --> 07:30.183
how do you like Amherst?

07:30.249 --> 07:32.785
Because I actually thought
about going there.

07:32.852 --> 07:35.087
Fine. It's kind of arctic.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.824
So, uh, what's on the agenda
for the week?

07:37.890 --> 07:38.991
Well, we were so excited
about you coming

07:39.058 --> 07:41.961
into town, we thought about
taking a couple days off.

07:42.028 --> 07:42.995
So I thought we would

07:43.062 --> 07:45.565
go to the Getty, and then
maybe hit the beach...

07:45.631 --> 07:46.999
-STEVE: Ryan! Hey, Mr. Premed!
-Steve-o!

07:47.066 --> 07:48.501
Buddy!

07:48.568 --> 07:49.869
Ha-ha-ha!

07:49.936 --> 07:52.104
Oh! This is my little brother.

07:52.171 --> 07:53.706
STEVE:
Hey.

07:53.773 --> 07:54.640
You look great.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.776
You are, uh, starting
to look like Dad.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.045
Hey, that's grounds
for a crotch fire, pal.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.947
Not unless you want
a tornado twister!

08:01.013 --> 08:03.850
Not a chance!
Oh, it's a brother thing.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.117
Right, I'm sure it is.

08:05.184 --> 08:08.120
I was just telling Ryan about
our plans for the week. So...

08:08.187 --> 08:09.722
-Yeah!
-Yeah, well, you see,

08:09.789 --> 08:11.123
I'm-I'm...
I'm all about partying.

08:11.190 --> 08:11.991
All about partying--
I mean, I want to go

08:12.058 --> 08:14.026
to SkyBar, Barfly, 360,
Dresden Room,

08:14.093 --> 08:15.962
Liquid Kitty, After Dark,
Dublin's.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.797
Bar Marmont.
You got the Union, the Gate.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.065
How about those, man?
Don't miss out.

08:19.131 --> 08:20.633
That's a lot of bars.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.968
We're so there.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.669
-Right on, pal.
-(laughs)

08:23.736 --> 08:25.071
JANET:
I am so happy

08:25.137 --> 08:26.772
to stay home with Maddy,

08:26.839 --> 08:28.875
so you guys just go ahead
and have a good time.

08:28.941 --> 08:29.876
Honey, you're the best.

08:29.942 --> 08:30.877
Head butt!

08:30.943 --> 08:31.744
Psych! Come on, man!

08:31.811 --> 08:35.214
(indistinct conversation,
laughter)

08:35.280 --> 08:38.017
I can assure you, Mrs. Sasadu,
I've handled cases like this.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.086
I'm talking six figures.
How about that?

08:40.152 --> 08:42.587
-No, not for six figures.
-Thank you.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.722
(click, dial tone drones)

08:43.789 --> 08:46.659
Hello? Hello?

08:48.661 --> 08:50.596
Unbelievable.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.798
I've made 20 cold calls
this morning

08:52.865 --> 08:53.933
trying to get new clients.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.102
One lady said my voice
sounds too young.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.970
Another guy says,
"You're not sharp enough."

08:58.037 --> 08:59.572
This other guy says,
"Uh, what's your name again?"

08:59.639 --> 09:00.840
I say, "Matt Durning."
He says, "Oh, yeah?

09:00.907 --> 09:02.041
Well, I don't trust
guys named Matt."

09:02.108 --> 09:03.809
Hangs up on me.
Can you believe that?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.011
Hung up on me.

09:05.077 --> 09:08.047
At this point,
I'm considering hari-kari.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.815
I think that pencil's
sharp enough.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.817
MATT:
Huh?

09:11.884 --> 09:13.052
(Kelly laughs)

09:13.119 --> 09:15.121
Oh. (laughs)

09:15.187 --> 09:16.956
Yeah, I guess it is.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.591
(clears throat)

09:18.658 --> 09:20.660
So anyway, what's up with you?

09:20.726 --> 09:22.828
(chuckling):
Oh... nothing.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.931
Tell me again why I quit my job.

09:24.997 --> 09:27.934
I mean, I know it was right
that I left Pia, but...

09:28.000 --> 09:29.802
But-but-but it is lunchtime,

09:29.869 --> 09:32.972
and you realized
you have nowhere to be.

09:33.039 --> 09:36.075
Nobody needs you back
for anything.

09:37.944 --> 09:40.780
Believe me, I feel the same way,
and I'm sitting

09:40.846 --> 09:42.148
-in my own office.
-(chuckles)

09:42.214 --> 09:44.784
-That's so comforting. Thanks.
-Yeah.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.719
Well, listen to me.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.055
You were good at PR.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.292
Have you given any more thought
to opening your own firm?

09:53.359 --> 09:55.328
Mmm, not today.

09:55.394 --> 09:58.831
I was with Dylan;
all my mental energy is zapped.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.866
Yeah.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.169
Um, so how is he doing?

10:03.235 --> 10:06.205
Okay, for a guy who thinks
his dead father

10:06.272 --> 10:08.240
-is alive.
-What?

10:09.408 --> 10:11.978
There's no solid proof,
but I believe him.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.679
-Okay.
-Jack, Dylan's dad,

10:13.746 --> 10:17.016
-Yeah. -...used an alias
to fly from Phoenix to L.A.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.352
-(laughs) Okay.
-Dylan recognized the name.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.187
I guess he took one of those

10:21.253 --> 10:23.189
commuter flights that
flies back and forth, like,

10:23.255 --> 10:24.390
-four times a day.
-Right.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.758
So we're gonna go
to the airport tonight

10:25.825 --> 10:26.659
and talk to the flight crew.

10:26.726 --> 10:29.061
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, hold on.

10:29.128 --> 10:33.766
Okay, now, if this is true--
if Jack McKay did fake his death

10:33.833 --> 10:35.368
and he's running
from some people,

10:35.434 --> 10:36.669
don't you think
blowing his cover

10:36.736 --> 10:37.903
could cause
some serious problems?

10:39.005 --> 10:41.173
Dylan's life derailed
when he lost his father.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.708
You weren't there.

10:42.775 --> 10:46.178
You have no idea
what this means to him.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.046
(sighs)

10:47.113 --> 10:50.049
Well, you could probably
use some help.

10:50.116 --> 10:53.152
I'm not gonna twist
your arm or anything.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.987
Well, you don't have to, okay?

10:55.054 --> 10:56.722
-I'm in.
-Good.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.024
All right.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.433
Uh-oh. I'm dating a stacker.

11:09.902 --> 11:10.970
The plates.

11:11.037 --> 11:13.839
When you stack them like that,
both sides get dirty.

11:13.906 --> 11:16.909
Uh-oh. I'm dating a compulsive,

11:16.976 --> 11:19.845
yet very attractive freak.

11:19.912 --> 11:20.913
(Camille laughs)

11:20.980 --> 11:22.815
(David chuckles)

11:22.882 --> 11:24.884
(phone ringing)

11:28.354 --> 11:29.722
Hello.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.123
Hey. Sorry I snapped

11:31.190 --> 11:34.026
at you last night,
but <i> Sleepaway Camp</i> is on.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.295
Hmm. Apology accepted.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.797
Is Noah still there?

11:37.863 --> 11:39.698
Yeah. He's in bed,
and I'm on the couch.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.866
I got to go.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.702
Bye.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.771
(laughs)

11:46.772 --> 11:48.107
That was Donna.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.809
We usually call each other

11:49.875 --> 11:51.410
whenever there's
a good horror flick on.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.379
You guys are like
my grandparents.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.847
(David chuckles,
Camille laughs)

11:54.914 --> 11:57.049
Bicker, make up, repeat.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.285
Kind of feels like we've known
each other that long.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.823
(phone ringing)

12:03.889 --> 12:06.158
Not <i> Sleepaway Camp.</i>
It's <i> Slumber Party Massacre.</i>

12:06.225 --> 12:07.359
So much better.

12:07.426 --> 12:09.895
Get out of here. All right.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.933
Uh, we got to go look
for the remote.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.909
(sighs)

12:28.948 --> 12:31.050
WOMAN (over P.A.): Passengers
arriving on flight 781

12:31.117 --> 12:34.453
may be met at gate 22
or on the lower level.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.822
See what you can find out
from them.

12:36.889 --> 12:37.990
-All right.
-Yeah.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.092
Uh, excuse me.

12:41.460 --> 12:42.561
He's a business associate.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.997
We're supposed to be meeting
in town for a convention.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.066
Try baggage claim, lower level.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.535
Uh, hi. Excuse me. Excuse me.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.036
My name's, uh,

12:51.103 --> 12:52.805
Dick Milsaps.
I work over at, uh, Coastal

12:52.872 --> 12:54.306
Auto Leasing on Concourse B.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.508
Uh, we had a mix-up

12:55.574 --> 12:57.810
with one of our passengers--
Eddie Waitkus.

12:57.877 --> 12:58.777
I was wondering if...

12:58.844 --> 13:00.546
Do you know
if Mr. Waitkus is on the flight?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.181
The flight was completely full.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.849
I barely remember my name.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.851
Yeah. I-I... I know
it's like that sometime.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.887
He's a real big VIP with us.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.889
Is there anybody else
that I could ask?

13:09.955 --> 13:11.423
You could check with Cathy,
the first class attendant.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.826
Cathy, this gentleman
has a question.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.060
Howdy. I'm, uh, Dick Milsaps.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.062
I work at Coastal Auto Leasings.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.531
I-I just wanted to know--

13:18.597 --> 13:21.400
uh, was there a passenger
named Eddie Waitkus

13:21.467 --> 13:23.102
-on your flight?
-Sorry. He wasn't on

13:23.169 --> 13:24.370
-this flight.
-Well, you know,

13:24.436 --> 13:26.138
our, uh, computers
broke down at work,

13:26.205 --> 13:27.540
and I need to inform Mr. Waitkus

13:27.606 --> 13:30.009
of a change of arrangements
that we've made for him.

13:30.075 --> 13:31.877
And I was wondering,
do you have a, uh...

13:31.944 --> 13:34.213
a contact number of any kind?

13:34.280 --> 13:36.949
Mmm. Mr. Milsaps,
I can't release that.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.951
Well...

13:39.018 --> 13:41.453
there goes my job, then.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.860
All right, look,

13:47.927 --> 13:49.895
I've heard him say
he lives in Tolleson,

13:49.962 --> 13:51.096
just outside Phoenix.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.065
But you didn't hear it from me.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.401
Oh, you're-you're...
you're an angel.

13:57.303 --> 13:58.904
Any luck?

13:58.971 --> 14:02.074
Anyone up for a trip
to Tolleson, Arizona?

14:15.487 --> 14:17.489
(snoring)

14:22.061 --> 14:24.163
(snoring continues)

14:29.702 --> 14:31.070
(both groaning)

14:31.136 --> 14:32.438
Rise and shine.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.873
(Steve groans)

14:36.408 --> 14:38.010
-Darling?
-Huh?

14:38.077 --> 14:39.478
-Hi.
-Hi, honey.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.879
Even though I know

14:40.946 --> 14:42.381
you came in
at the crack of dawn...

14:42.448 --> 14:43.882
-(Steve groans)
-And I know this because

14:43.949 --> 14:45.551
I heard you warn your brother
not to wake up

14:45.618 --> 14:47.386
the old ball and chain
'cause she'd freak.

14:47.453 --> 14:48.587
-Oh, boy.
-Yeah.

14:48.654 --> 14:49.622
Um, you have to get up.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.123
You have a meeting

14:51.190 --> 14:53.125
with the Sasquatch Watch Group
in about an hour.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.293
Can't you go, honey?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.895
Some people are trying
to sleep here.

14:56.962 --> 14:58.631
Okay? Thank you.

14:58.697 --> 15:00.532
No. I have to color proof.

15:00.599 --> 15:03.235
And remember, we're taking
the day off tomorrow

15:03.302 --> 15:04.536
for quality family time.

15:04.603 --> 15:05.638
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

15:05.704 --> 15:06.905
(Steve sighs)

15:08.741 --> 15:11.677
(Steve sighs)

15:11.744 --> 15:12.645
What is this?

15:12.711 --> 15:14.179
What happened?

15:14.246 --> 15:15.381
It was dark. I tripped.

15:15.447 --> 15:16.348
STEVE:
I...

15:16.415 --> 15:18.550
I always thought
that thing was ugly anyway.

15:18.617 --> 15:20.185
(laughing)

15:20.252 --> 15:21.687
-Steve?
-What?

15:21.754 --> 15:22.688
A word.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.024
Ow! Ow! Ow! Honey! Honey!

15:25.090 --> 15:27.593
STEVE:
Oh. Oh.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.528
Ow! Ow!

15:29.595 --> 15:30.963
Ouch! Ow!

15:31.030 --> 15:32.231
Stop showing off.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.333
I'm not showing off.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.336
Why is Ryan staying with us
and not at your dad's place?

15:37.403 --> 15:39.538
-Because Rush is out of town.
-Try again.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.541
Because he wanted to spend time
with his older brother.

15:42.608 --> 15:43.942
Exactly.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.511
Do you see how he constantly

15:45.577 --> 15:46.712
mimics you, and he's always

15:46.779 --> 15:48.280
trying to get your attention?

15:48.347 --> 15:50.182
No way. Ryan is the,

15:50.249 --> 15:51.950
uh... the brain of the family.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.953
(muffled laughter)

15:59.024 --> 16:01.026
But you're the one
with the legendary reputation,

16:01.093 --> 16:03.295
and maybe he's just trying
to live up to it.

16:03.362 --> 16:05.698
Well, I'm-I'm glad
he's coming out of his shell.

16:05.764 --> 16:08.000
-(Janet scoffs)
-You know what? Us Sanders men--

16:08.067 --> 16:09.702
we stir up a little trouble
every once in a while.

16:09.768 --> 16:11.170
We can't help it.
It's our birthright.

16:11.236 --> 16:12.604
Yeah, but you've been
really lucky.

16:12.671 --> 16:15.240
Every time you or your antics
got out of control,

16:15.307 --> 16:17.309
there was always somebody there
to reel you back in.

16:17.376 --> 16:19.611
For years, it was Brandon Walsh.
Now it's my full-time job.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.580
Well, who does Ryan have?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.748
(laughs)

16:22.815 --> 16:24.116
(clears his throat)

16:24.183 --> 16:26.318
-Me, I guess.
-Then, be that guy.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.554
Don't boss him around
or anything,

16:28.620 --> 16:31.023
but just give him
a little guidance, okay?

16:31.090 --> 16:32.257
STEVE:
Mm-hmm.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.492
(Steve laughs)

16:34.560 --> 16:36.662
Ryan, a little hungover?

16:37.696 --> 16:39.331
Yeah. Yeah, a little bit.

16:39.398 --> 16:40.599
Okay.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.267
Bloody Marys coming up, then.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.602
Great. I'm pouring.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.636
Clothesline.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.004
Oh. (laughs)

16:46.071 --> 16:49.475
(grunting)

16:49.541 --> 16:50.676
ANNOUNCER:
Weather for the Southland.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.244
Look for mostly cloudy skies
early

16:52.311 --> 16:53.679
with a chance of light showers.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.414
Highs are gonna be up
in the 70s.

16:55.481 --> 16:58.283
Tonight, clearing with lows
in the 60s, 50s at the beaches.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.718
It's gonna be mostly sunny
for the weekend...

16:59.785 --> 17:02.221
-DONNA: Hey.
-Hey.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.556
(chuckles) Look at this place.
It's spotless.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.626
Yeah, I'm pretty slow,
but I'm quite effective.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.461
You know the doctor said
you're not supposed

17:09.528 --> 17:10.695
-to move around a lot.
-I know.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.698
I know.
I just wanted to help out.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.401
Well, thank you.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.469
(Noah groans)

17:18.470 --> 17:20.406
(sighs)

17:20.472 --> 17:21.673
You okay?

17:21.740 --> 17:24.675
Yeah, I'm good.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.244
Yeah, you look a little tired.

17:27.279 --> 17:28.680
Oh, really?

17:28.747 --> 17:31.083
Maybe I'm just
catching a cold or something.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.484
I don't know.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.786
(seagull cawing)

17:33.852 --> 17:35.187
(Noah sighs)

17:35.254 --> 17:38.690
Couple weeks ago,
thought I was gonna die.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.526
I really did.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.628
All I could think about was you.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.165
We've been through a lot.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.634
(scoffs)
Yeah, we have.

17:50.169 --> 17:53.105
If we had another chance, I'd do
a lot of things differently.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.375
Especially the end.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.457
Noah.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.460
What?

18:16.228 --> 18:18.363
I know what you're feeling.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.433
I feel lonely all the time.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.469
Then, why can't we just
sit here and...?

18:23.535 --> 18:24.803
Because we can't.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.507
Because after we broke up,

18:28.574 --> 18:32.578
you were out partying
and drinking all night long.

18:32.644 --> 18:35.147
I wasn't.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.583
I was dealing with it.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.119
And it was sad,

18:41.186 --> 18:44.256
and it hurt... a lot.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.158
But I got over it.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.126
And now that you're sober,

18:48.193 --> 18:50.629
you're just finally feeling it.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.698
(sighs)

18:57.936 --> 18:59.505
You're right.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.773
(sighs)

19:01.840 --> 19:03.842
I'm sorry.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.913
I'm gonna call a cab
and get out of your way.

19:09.348 --> 19:10.849
(sighs)

19:10.916 --> 19:12.284
I'm sorry.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.652
(line ringing)

19:13.719 --> 19:14.920
MAN (over phone):
Directory Assistance.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.190
Yeah, can I have the number of
"Got to Go" Cab Company, please?

19:18.257 --> 19:19.591
MAN:
Yes, sir.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.493
Just a minute, please.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.562
Okay.

19:41.547 --> 19:45.217
What is taking Kelly so long?

19:45.284 --> 19:47.586
You want me to go get her?

19:47.653 --> 19:48.921
No, not yet.

19:48.987 --> 19:51.323
It's just a waste of time.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.792
I mean, you blew off
a day's work, we jumped

19:53.859 --> 19:55.360
on a plane and flew here

19:55.427 --> 19:56.528
just because
some stewardess mentions it.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.231
Now Kelly's in there pretending
to be related to my dad.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.967
Why? So she can find out
his home address.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.702
For what?

20:03.769 --> 20:05.370
What's with the 180?

20:05.437 --> 20:07.973
What? He couldn't pick up
a phone just one time?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.741
Not if people wanted him dead.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.610
-I don't think so.
-I could have

20:11.677 --> 20:12.778
helped him hide, you know?

20:12.844 --> 20:13.979
I mean,
I would have given him money.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.380
It's his money.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.350
Worked like a charm.

20:18.417 --> 20:19.451
Bernie was more than happy

20:19.518 --> 20:20.686
to give Mrs. Eddie Waitkus

20:20.752 --> 20:22.754
a copy of her billing statement.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.657
"E. Waitkus.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.693
11 Peachtree Road."

20:27.759 --> 20:29.795
Come on, let's go.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.910
(David sighs)

20:44.977 --> 20:46.678
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.281
I thought you were gonna cook
for me tonight.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.649
Yeah.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.484
Well, that was a blatant lie.

20:52.551 --> 20:53.752
Oh.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.621
See, I want to save my energy
for the long,

20:55.687 --> 20:57.923
drawn-out seduction
I have planned for later.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.492
Oh, yeah?
Who's the lucky girl?

21:00.559 --> 21:01.893
I'm taking volunteers.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.762
Oh, I will.

21:07.799 --> 21:08.967
(Camille sighs)

21:09.034 --> 21:10.869
So, how's your day?

21:10.936 --> 21:14.039
Um, a little off, actually.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.907
Yeah?

21:15.974 --> 21:18.910
I screwed up things with Donna.

21:18.977 --> 21:20.646
Yeah? What happened?

21:20.712 --> 21:22.948
I got on this weird rant

21:23.015 --> 21:25.050
about how perfect
my life is right now.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.786
And as the words were coming out
of my mouth,

21:27.853 --> 21:31.523
I realized
that I've basically stolen

21:31.590 --> 21:32.891
everything from Donna's world.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.626
Well, that's not true.

21:34.693 --> 21:37.295
The store, her boyfriend.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.531
Her ex-boyfriend.

21:39.598 --> 21:41.533
Still.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.768
Well, I feel bad.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.836
I mean, things stink
for her right now,

21:44.903 --> 21:47.806
and there I was rubbing
my happiness right in her face.

21:47.873 --> 21:50.509
Camille, I think you're being
a little sensitive right now.

21:50.575 --> 21:52.978
All right, Donna's not
that kind of person.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.413
Believe me, I know.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.614
She's my best friend.

21:55.681 --> 21:57.716
I'm still getting used
to the idea

21:57.783 --> 22:00.652
that your best friend
is not only a woman,

22:00.719 --> 22:02.487
but an ex-girlfriend.

22:02.554 --> 22:03.722
I just feel

22:03.789 --> 22:06.892
like our relationship is trying
to grow in its giant shadow.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.694
I can't just drop her.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.762
David, no, I would never ask you
to do that.

22:10.829 --> 22:15.100
I was hoping
for a little distance sometimes.

22:16.768 --> 22:18.770
I'm glad you said something.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.643
Thank you.

with a movie update.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.719
Go ahead. Go ahead.

22:33.785 --> 22:36.621
No, I'll let
my voice mail get it.

22:38.156 --> 22:39.091

It's David.

22:39.157 --> 22:40.659
Leave a message.

22:40.726 --> 22:41.760
Hey, it's me.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.028
Uh, just give me a call.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.097
Bye.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.518
You know, Matt's a good guy.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.787
He, uh... he didn't have
to pretend

23:08.854 --> 23:11.890
like he had work
back at the motel.

23:11.957 --> 23:15.827
Yeah, he didn't think
you'd want an entourage.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.999
Life on the run seems
pretty idyllic.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.102
We've been sitting here
for hours.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.705
-Yeah. -Maybe this
is a fake address, too.

23:28.006 --> 23:30.008
(sighs)

23:47.192 --> 23:49.194
What should we do?

23:51.730 --> 23:53.999
Dylan, go to him.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.737
-Come on.
-Daddy!

23:58.804 --> 23:59.938
(Jack laughs)

24:00.005 --> 24:03.108
All right, buddy.
How you doing? Huh?

24:03.175 --> 24:04.943
(indistinct conversation)

24:05.010 --> 24:07.746
Are you going to go to him?

24:13.718 --> 24:16.221
There's no place for me here.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.876
I'm... so sorry.

24:37.943 --> 24:38.944
Well, you should be.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.613
I fell asleep with the phone
under me and woke up

24:41.680 --> 24:42.881
with "*69" imprinted on my face.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.951
The only reason Camille is late
is because we were at her place

24:46.017 --> 24:47.919
and I set the alarm wrong.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.921
She's getting coffee.
She'll be right in.

24:49.988 --> 24:53.825
So you aren't apologizing
for not calling me back?

24:53.892 --> 24:57.128
Oh... right.

24:57.195 --> 24:58.697
I needed to talk to you.

24:58.763 --> 24:59.698
What-- Noah?

24:59.764 --> 25:01.533
Obviously. Look,

25:01.600 --> 25:04.769
we somehow ended up on the couch
discussing old times

25:04.836 --> 25:07.672
and before I knew it,
he kissed me.

25:08.740 --> 25:09.741
Well?

25:11.042 --> 25:13.712
I'm trying so hard
not to say it.

25:13.778 --> 25:14.913
Fine, you told me so.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.215
W-Why does this keep happening
to me?

25:17.282 --> 25:18.750
You're too nice.

25:18.817 --> 25:19.985
Well, I just got to learn

25:20.051 --> 25:21.253
how to set better boundaries,
that's all.

25:21.319 --> 25:22.687
But who's gonna teach me that?

25:22.754 --> 25:23.855
You got a pen
and a piece of paper?

25:23.922 --> 25:25.023
You might want
to take some notes.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.759
Oh, great. I don't like
the sound of this.

25:27.826 --> 25:30.996
It's just... you know,
now that I'm dating Camille,

25:31.062 --> 25:33.598
we may have to change
a few things.

25:33.665 --> 25:34.766
-Like?
-Like...

25:34.833 --> 25:36.735
late-night phone calls.

25:36.801 --> 25:39.004
-What, now I can't call you
anymore? -Donna,

25:39.070 --> 25:41.006
of course you can, just not
two or three times a night.

25:41.072 --> 25:44.009
Oh. I do do that, don't I?

25:44.075 --> 25:45.744
Oh, my God, am I driving
you guys crazy?

25:45.810 --> 25:47.612
(chuckling):
No, we both do it.

25:47.679 --> 25:49.881
Just not anymore.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.151
I hear what you're saying.

25:54.185 --> 25:56.755
Half decaf, half caf.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.224
Full apology-- sorry I'm late.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.959
Oh, no problem.

26:01.026 --> 26:01.960
Let's get started.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.194
Yes.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.744
DYLAN:
What's going on?

26:19.811 --> 26:23.248
Um, Matt has an appointment
with a potential client.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.250
Yeah, it's my first
since the suspension,

26:25.317 --> 26:26.818
so I got to get back home.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.320
But I'm gonna stay with you.

26:28.386 --> 26:29.821
It could take a while.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.723
You know, Dylan,
if your father hears

26:31.790 --> 26:33.758
that someone's poking around,
asking all these questions,

26:33.825 --> 26:34.759
he might take off.

26:36.795 --> 26:40.131
I, uh, think I forgot
something in the room.

26:42.167 --> 26:44.336
It's now or never.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.771
From what I saw,
his new life looks

26:46.838 --> 26:48.773
-a lot better than his old one.
-Why?

26:48.840 --> 26:50.208
Because he has a wife
and little boy?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.376
His son.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.978
He has two.

26:55.146 --> 26:56.715
Come on, let's go get
some breakfast.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.149
I'll figure out what's next.

your entire life now?

27:45.130 --> 27:47.999
No, it's not our entire life.

27:48.066 --> 27:49.134

shouldn't have brought it up.

like this might be a test.

32:06.624 --> 32:07.558
It's not a test.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.227
(both chuckle)

32:09.294 --> 32:10.628
Oh, give me a second, all right?

32:10.695 --> 32:12.563

Hey, it's me.

-Hey.
-Well,

32:27.345 --> 32:28.279
I'm on my way.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.415
Um, listen, I'm just...

32:30.481 --> 32:33.318
I'm gonna stop next door and
grab a bite to eat with Donna.

32:34.352 --> 32:35.687
Let me guess.

32:35.753 --> 32:37.655
She just popped
into the equation.

32:37.722 --> 32:38.956
You were listening.

32:39.023 --> 32:41.626
Yeah, I like
to hear you sign off,

especially when it means
I'm about to see you.

32:44.262 --> 32:45.229
I don't want you to think

32:45.296 --> 32:47.665
that, uh, I forgot
about what you were saying.

32:47.732 --> 32:52.603
It's just, you know, Noah's here
and Donna's a little worried.

32:52.670 --> 32:57.175
So she takes care of him
and you take care of her.

32:57.241 --> 32:59.744
There's a certain

33:02.313 --> 33:04.215
David, it's fine.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.150
It's late. I'm tired.

33:06.217 --> 33:08.753
Um... go do what you have to do,

33:08.820 --> 33:11.522

I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

Yeah, it's good.

You sure?

33:27.238 --> 33:28.339
Mm-hmm.

33:28.406 --> 33:30.375
Good.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.184
-Hey.
-Hi.

33:40.251 --> 33:42.754
So, what's the surprise
you promised?

33:42.820 --> 33:44.689
Well, did you know
that Kali's Copy Shop

33:44.756 --> 33:46.657

33:46.724 --> 33:48.393

No, I don't think I knew that.

That is great. You're-you're...
you're taking the plunge.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.035
You're doing it.
I am so proud of you.

33:58.102 --> 34:00.405
I've been out there all morning,
and I've already snagged

34:00.471 --> 34:03.074
my first account-- young,
hip boutique-- Now Wear This.

34:03.141 --> 34:04.308
I think I know that place.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.576
I'm friends
with the owner, you know.

34:05.643 --> 34:07.678
I just had to apologize
for a few harsh words

34:07.745 --> 34:09.580
I said to her
in the emergency room.

34:09.647 --> 34:11.282
Yeah, well, I'm glad
you two straightened out

34:11.349 --> 34:13.217
that whole Noah thing.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.719

Hey, Dylan.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.827
KELLY:
Hi.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.263
-How'd it go?
-Not so well.

34:25.329 --> 34:27.732
What do you mean?
What did your dad say?

34:27.799 --> 34:30.333
I don't want
to talk about it right now.

34:33.804 --> 34:34.772
I'm gonna...

34:34.839 --> 34:36.841
Yeah.

34:42.313 --> 34:45.750
Excuse me. Am I wrong,
or were we working together?

34:47.351 --> 34:49.286
-It's over.
-Dylan, listen to me.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.688
If your dad doesn't want you
in his life,

34:50.755 --> 34:52.389
-then it is his loss.
-You know what?

34:52.456 --> 34:54.559
I couldn't even make it
up the driveway.

34:54.625 --> 34:55.659
He was sitting
in the living room

34:55.726 --> 34:56.828
reading the newspaper.

34:56.893 --> 34:58.729
His wife was off
in the other room,

34:58.796 --> 35:00.164
and the kid tucked in bed.

35:00.231 --> 35:02.533
And I asked myself,
"Who is that guy?"

35:02.600 --> 35:05.136
It was then I decided
he's a happy man.

35:05.203 --> 35:06.304
And what about you

35:06.370 --> 35:07.538
and everything
that's been taken away?

35:07.605 --> 35:09.407
Conversation
isn't gonna change that.

35:09.474 --> 35:10.608
A million couldn't.

35:10.675 --> 35:12.677
It might help you understand
everything that's happened.

35:12.743 --> 35:14.745
Yeah, and make everything else
I've been through

35:14.812 --> 35:16.481
seem even more pointless?

35:16.547 --> 35:18.616
Kelly, why do you think
I go on binges?

35:18.683 --> 35:19.684
My dad died.

35:19.750 --> 35:22.720
I push people away from me
who try to get close.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.655
I never, ever finish anything
I start.

35:24.722 --> 35:26.657
Why? Because my dad died?

35:26.724 --> 35:29.727
I don't know who I am
without using that as a crutch.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.762
I don't know
if I'm ready to find out.

35:31.829 --> 35:33.297
That excuse
doesn't work anymore,

35:33.364 --> 35:34.665
because your dad is alive.

35:34.732 --> 35:37.702
Not as far as I'm concerned.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.706
(engine revving)

35:55.253 --> 35:57.255
NOAH:
Hi.

35:58.256 --> 36:00.258
We're out of milk.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.663
Pretty good crowd
last night, huh?

36:07.365 --> 36:09.767
Yeah, including Donna.

36:12.803 --> 36:13.638
What's that supposed to mean?

36:13.704 --> 36:16.274
-She told me you kissed her.
-So what?

36:16.340 --> 36:18.376
It's none of your business.

36:19.744 --> 36:22.346
I think you should give her
some space, that's all.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.415
I don't need a lecture
right now.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.685
(both sigh)

36:27.752 --> 36:29.387
Noah, she is trying
to move forward,

36:29.453 --> 36:31.422
all right, and you just keep
pulling her back.

36:31.489 --> 36:32.390
You think I do that?

36:32.456 --> 36:33.691
Yeah, I know you do.

36:33.758 --> 36:35.660
(scoffs)
Why don't you take a long

36:35.726 --> 36:37.361
look in the mirror?

36:37.428 --> 36:40.498
Last night, Donna came
to see me, all right?

36:40.565 --> 36:42.900
We talked for, what,
13 seconds?

36:42.967 --> 36:44.902
Meanwhile, you're hovering
over the girl

36:44.969 --> 36:46.270
every single chance you get.

36:46.337 --> 36:47.705
Noah, it's nowhere near
the same thing.

36:47.772 --> 36:50.308
You can twist it out
any way you like, man.

36:50.374 --> 36:53.611
You're the one
that can't get over her.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.895
So, did she buy
the last sundress?

37:10.962 --> 37:12.663
Yep.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.665
Your stuff just flies
off the racks.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.902
Oh, well, just for that,
you can take lunch first.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.871
(laughing):
Thanks.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.907
Camille, um,

37:22.974 --> 37:25.676
I just...
I just want to say I'm sorry

37:25.743 --> 37:28.813
if I've been getting in the way
of you and David lately.

37:28.879 --> 37:30.414
It's just
that we're old friends,

37:30.481 --> 37:32.783
and I-I guess I'm used
to monopolizing his time.

37:32.850 --> 37:34.986
Oh, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.420
I mean, I don't expect you

37:36.487 --> 37:37.855
to know we're together
when you call.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.625
But we are.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.493
A lot.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.662
It's kind of weird, actually.

37:44.729 --> 37:47.465
Usually, it doesn't happen
that fast.

37:47.531 --> 37:50.301
-Yeah, it has been fast.
-Oh, you noticed?

37:50.368 --> 37:52.970
I've just noticed
how crazy David is about you.

37:53.037 --> 37:54.605
And I'm just happy that

37:54.672 --> 37:56.607
two good people found
each other, that's all.

37:56.674 --> 37:58.809
Oh. So I have your blessing?

37:58.876 --> 38:00.878
Oh, you don't need my blessing.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.481
Well, I know I don't,
but I want it.

38:03.547 --> 38:04.782
Our friendship's important
to me.

38:04.849 --> 38:06.884
Plus, we work together,

38:06.951 --> 38:09.920
and I want your seal of approval

38:09.987 --> 38:12.390
before I fall for David
any harder.

38:13.424 --> 38:15.726
Go fall.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.728
Okay. Thank you.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.030
(chuckles)

38:19.096 --> 38:20.297
All right, see you later.

38:20.364 --> 38:22.366
Bye.

38:31.108 --> 38:33.310
(cooing)

38:34.812 --> 38:36.914
Nat says Ryan's not
at the Peach Pit.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.716
Maybe we should call the cops.

38:38.783 --> 38:39.950
And say what?

38:40.017 --> 38:41.986
A college kid on spring break
met a waitress

38:42.053 --> 38:43.020
and didn't come home last night?

38:43.087 --> 38:45.389
I knew we shouldn't
have left him at the club.

38:45.456 --> 38:46.757
Honey, just call Noah,

38:46.824 --> 38:49.060
because he probably has
that waitress's phone number.

38:49.126 --> 38:50.361
You know, normally,
I wouldn't care,

38:50.428 --> 38:51.996
but Ryan almost died

38:52.063 --> 38:54.031
from alcohol poisoning
four years ago.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.368
(cooing)

39:00.071 --> 39:02.606
(footsteps approaching)

39:03.607 --> 39:05.109
Morning.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.878
Morning?

39:07.945 --> 39:09.914
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.
Where the hell

39:09.980 --> 39:11.415
were you?

39:11.482 --> 39:12.850
I was with, uh,
Katrina Morowsky.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.485
Actually, her friends
call her Kitty.

39:14.552 --> 39:16.053
And Steve, she purrs.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.354
(purring)

39:17.421 --> 39:18.956
JANET:
Hey, Ryan, we really

39:19.023 --> 39:19.924
wish you would have called.

39:19.990 --> 39:22.526
Sorry, Mom.
I didn't know I had a curfew.

39:22.593 --> 39:23.861
STEVE:
Didn't know you needed one,

39:23.928 --> 39:24.862
you jerk!

39:24.929 --> 39:26.797
And don't you ever talk
to my wife like that.

39:26.864 --> 39:27.965
Come on, chill out, Steve.

39:28.032 --> 39:28.899
What, like, you never pulled

39:28.966 --> 39:30.735
this kind of stuff
when you were my age?

39:30.801 --> 39:32.436
Well, if I did,
it was a mistake.

39:32.503 --> 39:33.938
Do you stay out all night
at school?

39:34.004 --> 39:35.606
How do you keep your grades up?

39:35.673 --> 39:37.408
This from a guy
who partied four years straight,

39:37.475 --> 39:39.043
only to have his dad
buy him a newspaper?

39:40.578 --> 39:43.047
If he helped me,
it's because I needed it.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.815
You don't need help.
You're smart.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.584
Will you stop saying that?!

39:48.018 --> 39:51.422
I think Steve just has
high expectations for you.

39:51.489 --> 39:52.656
Yeah, well, you know what?

39:52.723 --> 39:54.558
I didn't ask
for a fan club, okay?

39:54.625 --> 39:56.894
Hey, Ryan.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.129
What happened to you?

40:01.232 --> 40:06.103
I was a brain in high school,
and it sucked.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.706
So, you know what? I went to
college, and I tried being you.

40:08.773 --> 40:10.407
I went to keggers,

40:10.474 --> 40:12.610
I blew off classes,
I slept in late.

40:12.676 --> 40:14.712
I had a blast.

40:14.779 --> 40:16.981
Guess what, Steve.

40:17.047 --> 40:18.616
You'd make a lousy doctor.

40:22.119 --> 40:23.888
I'm on academic probation.

40:23.954 --> 40:25.956
Bye-bye, med school.

40:27.191 --> 40:28.659
(sighs)

40:28.726 --> 40:29.994
I'm sorry to hear that.

40:31.529 --> 40:33.464
But it's not the end
of the world, Ryan.

40:33.531 --> 40:34.865
No.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.200
No. Just college.

40:37.635 --> 40:38.836
Dropped out.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.941
Ryan?

40:44.008 --> 40:45.176
(sighs)

40:45.242 --> 40:46.744
That's it.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.914
We're stopping at one kid.

40:55.719 --> 40:57.988
Get out of here.
<i>The Mummy's Ghost</i> is on.

40:59.824 --> 41:01.091
Ew!

41:01.158 --> 41:02.660
-Ew? You sissy.
-Ew.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.795
I'll cover your eyes
during the scary parts.

41:04.862 --> 41:06.831
Come on.

41:06.897 --> 41:08.499
(indistinct voices on TV)

41:08.566 --> 41:10.568
(suspenseful theme plays)

41:12.002 --> 41:14.004

41:22.780 --> 41:24.748

41:27.852 --> 41:28.953
