- I can’t believe
you’re really here.

00:13.139 --> 00:16.723
- You should’ve called me first.
- And ruin the surprise?
No way.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.640
You tell Mom and Dad
you were coming out?

Are you kidding?

00:21.647 --> 00:23.729
I finished my last final
and took the first flight
I could get.

00:23.816 --> 00:26.273

- Ah. They’ll get over it.

you cou/o’n ’2‘ be home
for the holidays,

00:30.114 --> 00:32.821
- I’d bring a piece of home to you.
- What are you talking about?

00:35.411 --> 00:38.153
Say hello
to my little friends.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.738
Marcus, you can ’t
bring that here.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.080
- What’s the big deal?
- Get rid of it right now.

00:46.172 --> 00:48.584
Oh, relax.
We’ll smoke it
back at your place.

00:53.346 --> 00:55.962
Put it away.
Put it back
in your pack right now.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.009
Why?
Just do it, Marcus!

01:06.525 --> 01:09.267

01:49.694 --> 01:52.811

- Okay.

the most holy laws.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.227
I do not deny this.

I’m so sorry

02:44.582 --> 02:48.245
I do not deny this.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.749
I also apologize...

02:52.840 --> 02:56.082
and beg forgiveness.

03:00.181 --> 03:03.014
They sound terrible.
Do you hear
how terrible they sound?

03:03.142 --> 03:06.976
Diane, you gotta
let ’em do theirjob.
[Man] Listen, lto/o’ you...

03:07.063 --> 03:09.554
that we’re negotiating
with the Yemeni government
to release your children.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.685
We’rejust having trouble
getting a read
on their negotiator.

03:12.777 --> 03:14.813
And that is why we hired
the Lightman Group.

03:14.904 --> 03:16.440
We understand how hard
this must be.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.317
We can tell you
that last year
the Lightman Group...

03:19.450 --> 03:23.238
helped free several
American hostages in Colombia.
You have to be patient.

03:23.329 --> 03:25.991
It’s been 29 days,
and my children...

03:26.082 --> 03:30.451
are halfway around the world
having God knows what
done to them.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.455
Don’t tell me to be patient.

03:37.510 --> 03:40.547
You might’ve tried
a little diplomacy
with Mom and Dad there.

03:40.638 --> 03:44.051
Please. I don’t have time
to hold hands. The situation’s
getting worse by the minute.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.006
Why are the Yemenis
detaining them?

03:46.102 --> 03:48.889
The brother Marcus
was visiting the sister
on spring break.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.890
Yemeni police pulled
’em over for speeding.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.892
They find an ounce
of marijuana in the car.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.771
Under Islamic law,
trafficking drugs
is punishable by death.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.114
Nicole slurred a few words.
Have they been tortured?

03:59.198 --> 04:01.109
Well, she might’ve seemed
sleep-deprived.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.442
But Yemen is definitely
not known for its humane
treatment of foreign prisoners.

04:06.539 --> 04:08.871
[Eli]
/s that their negotiator?

04:08.958 --> 04:12.371
Yep. The guy speaks in monotone,
has an endless list of demands.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.669
And we have no idea
What he actually needs
to get a deal done.

04:15.756 --> 04:19.590
So ifyou can pick up
anything in his speech
or his body language—

04:19.677 --> 04:22.464
- Get a read on him.
- We’ll take a look at
the negotiation footage we—

04:22.555 --> 04:24.841
I don’t need details. Okay?

04:24.932 --> 04:29.346
I need answers.
Nicole and Marcus are being
sentenced in two days.

04:29.437 --> 04:32.645

05:24.074 --> 05:26.531
Dr. Lightman’sjust
finishing up a call.
Oh, great.

05:26.619 --> 05:29.235
You must be the new wunderkind
he’s told me so much about.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.498
Oh.
How many times
has he lied to you?

05:31.624 --> 05:34.240
Excuse me?
Well, he said
you’re a natural.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.542
You must’ve caught him
in some big fat ones.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.661
Yeah, maybe one or two.
One or two?

05:38.756 --> 05:41.998
He’s mellowed out.
Back in the day,
he was pathological.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.341
ReaHy?
Oh, seriously.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.044
The morning of my 25th birthday,
I look out my dorm window,

05:47.139 --> 05:50.882
and there parked outside is a vintage
Harley registered in my name.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.592
I have no idea how
he pulled that off.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.640
Come on.
I’m serious.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.473
That boy lied, cheated and stole
his way through Oxford.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.975
I never stole.
[Chuckles]
So you say.

06:01.070 --> 06:04.938
- Hey. Ah, it’s good to see you.
- And you.

06:05.074 --> 06:07.531

06:07.618 --> 06:09.950

06:10.037 --> 06:12.494
- Yep.
- Former US. Surgeon General.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.830

quite an important man.
Don’t let him fool you.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.499
I’m still quite
an important man.
[Chuckling]

06:17.586 --> 06:20.043
Yeah.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.258
- Something wrong, Jeffrey?
- I need your help, Cal.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.378
[ Woman]
He ’5 27!

06:25.469 --> 06:27.801
Who has a stroke at 27.7

06:27.888 --> 06:30.595
Mrs. Coleman,
Ribocore will do everything
we can to help you.

06:30.683 --> 06:33.846
Everything? What are you doing
to track down the people
who did this to my husband?

06:33.978 --> 06:36.435
Well, we actually—
[jeffrey]
That’s Erica I/andeman.

06:36.522 --> 06:39.685
She ’s the C. E. 0.
of Ribocore Pharmaceutical

06:39.775 --> 06:43.142
Is that one ofthe companies
that throws money at you?

06:44.238 --> 06:46.149
I only take their money
ifI believe in ’em.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.449
Erica was a student of mine
at Georgetown.
She’s one of the good guys.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.869
Six weeks ago, someone
broke into the Ribocore labs.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.867
Stole the formula
for Priox.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.701
It’s their new
Insulin p/ll.
Recent/y,

06:59.795 --> 07:02.707
a cheaper knockoffversion
hit the market.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.873
And it’s killing people,
Cal.

07:08.846 --> 07:12.384
Dre w Coleman is
the third case we’ve found
They all took the knockoff.

07:12.474 --> 07:15.386
Priox is
a complicated compound.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.219
Run the formula the wrong way,
and the side effects can be lethal.

07:18.314 --> 07:20.350
Why don’t you just
call in the FDA?

07:20.441 --> 07:22.147
F.D.A. investigation
would take months.

07:22.234 --> 07:25.943
Our IT. guys say
the data theft is an insidejob.

07:26.030 --> 07:29.113
Only three chemists have
lab access. They’re all
denying they were involved.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.281
|fyou could tell us
who’s lying,

07:31.368 --> 07:33.620
we can find out who’s making
the knockoffand shut them down.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.571
Ifwe don’t get
this counterfeit drug
offthe market soon,

07:36.665 --> 07:39.042
we are looking at
hundreds ofdeaths.

07:44.715 --> 07:48.458
Okay The Ribocore theﬁ‘
took place at 2:27 a. m...

07:48.552 --> 07:52.511
In testing lab 290.

07:52.598 --> 07:58.309
And one ofyou disabled
the scanner so it couldn’t
identify your key card.

07:58.437 --> 08:02.100
I’m a chemist, not an engineer.
I wasn’t even in
the building that night.

08:02.191 --> 08:06.230
Now, you managed to avoid
the security cameras.
But—

08:06.320 --> 08:08.777
You know, this is ridiculous.
I’ve worked for Ribocore
for 15 years.

08:08.864 --> 08:13.198
But one ofyou,
when you downloaded
the Priox formula,

08:13.285 --> 08:15.822
left your fingerprint
on the data port.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.280
Well, you can check m/ne.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.491
Come on.
I use that computer
all the time.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.701
So do I. I mean,
you can’t possibly think—

08:23.796 --> 08:25.878
No, I don’t.
So you two can go.

08:27.966 --> 08:32.835
50... why d/d you steal
the Priox formula?
I d id n ’t.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.921
Go ahead.
Check my fingerprints.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.757
- You didn’t leave any.
- I made that up.

08:37.893 --> 08:41.306
What are you talking about?
[Cal]
Our thief wore gloves.

08:41.397 --> 08:43.308
But you knew that,
didn’t you?

08:43.399 --> 08:45.606
That’s why you leapt
at the chance
to prove your innocence.

08:45.693 --> 08:50.483
Now, only a guilty person
would know that the fingerprint
couldn’t possibly be theirs.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.359
[Sighs]
Al/r/ght.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.657
Call Vandeman, tell her
we found who stole
the information.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.321
- It’s not what you think.
- No, see, it’s not what you think.

09:00.416 --> 09:02.498
That formula you sold,
your knockoff Priox,

09:02.626 --> 09:04.241
it’s killing people.
You’re wrong.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.952
I didn’t break into the lab
to steal the formula.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.208
Why then?

09:09.299 --> 09:12.006
Two months ago,
I came across a lab study...

09:12.094 --> 09:15.086
that said stroke was
a possible Priox side effect.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.387
Vandeman had buried
the full report.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.886
But it was in the database
in testing lab 290.

09:19.977 --> 09:23.185
I was trying to build
a case against the drug.

09:23.272 --> 09:26.981
The problem isn ’t
knockolfPrioX.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.353
It’s the real drug
that’s the killer.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.073
- This is new.
- [Chuckles]

09:44.168 --> 09:46.284
I asked Grace not
to let anybody back here.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.710
/’m going on [any ng
to talk up
the new ﬂu vaccine.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.459
So this isjust,
you know, saving time.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.542
Does your missus know
how much you spend
on makeup?

09:54.636 --> 09:57.048
And unless you want
Larry King to know
how you got drunk...

09:57.139 --> 09:59.004
and talked your way
past White House security—

09:59.141 --> 10:00.927
Never happened.
Oh, that never happened?

10:01.018 --> 10:03.179
Well, this never
happened either.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.386
- I need to talk to you
about Erica Vandeman.
- Yeah.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.184
Derek,just, um, give us
a second. Thanks.
Sure, sure.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.855
You find out
who broke into the lab
and stole the formula?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.156
The chemist
who broke into the lab
wasn’t after the formula.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.279
ReaHy?

10:20.370 --> 10:23.112
“Early stage testing
on Priox.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.994
“Blood c/o tt/ng leading...

10:26.084 --> 10:28.951
to stroke.”

10:29.046 --> 10:31.458
What? This chemist
is pretending to be
some kind ofa whistleblower?

10:31.548 --> 10:34.506
No, a study says that
the real drug is the killer.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.502
Cal, that doesn’t make sense.
Why would Erica hire you?

10:38.597 --> 10:40.588
Damage control?
You hire us,

10:40.724 --> 10:45.718
and you spin this into a story
about a counterfeit drug.
No, not Erica.

10:45.813 --> 10:49.476
Ifshe thought this drug
was killing people, she’d be
first to pull it offthe market.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.308
Well, the chemist
doesn’t appear
to be lying.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.355
And the study
indicates that—
/ndicates what?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.437
What does it indicate?
It indicates nothing.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.693
Maybe that lab was careless.
Maybe they made a mistake.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.738
So you think I should
talk to them?
Cal.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.867
/ have known
Erica I/andeman for years.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.826
And you spent, what,
five minutes with this chemist?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.956
/’m as worried about
this drug as you are.

11:12.047 --> 11:16.040
So give me the name,
and I will look into this.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.125
Okay.

11:26.103 --> 11:29.345
Hey, Heather.
Gillian.
What are you doing here?

11:29.439 --> 11:34.058
We’re working with Peters
on the Yemeni negotiations.
Is my husband—

11:34.152 --> 11:35.733
He’s at lunch.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.784
Well, tell him
I stopped by.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.044
You’re here early.
I like to be prepared.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.498
Oh. Well, you’re not
billing me forit.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.501
Where’s the Chia Pet?
Loker?

12:00.596 --> 12:03.053
Yeah. That guy definitely
needs a shave and a haircut.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.051
He’s monitoring the
closed-circuit cameras...

12:05.142 --> 12:07.178
so we can do stress analysis
on the Yemenis.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.430
But / ’m sure

12:09.521 --> 12:11.807

It’s a pleasure meeting you.

12:28.332 --> 12:31.369

on our position?

12:31.501 --> 12:33.366
She wouldn’t mind
hearing it again.
Very well.

12:33.503 --> 12:36.540
We have several demands.
[Gill/an]
Yes, I’m sure.

12:36.632 --> 12:41.797
But, actually,
I’d prefer to hear it from
Deputy Ambassador Rafik.

12:50.062 --> 12:52.474
I’m happy to oblige.

12:52.564 --> 12:57.684
As Deputy Ambassador Hassan
was saying,
we have several demands.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.405
Well, you don’t know
what the hell you’re doing.
We have two days,

13:03.492 --> 13:05.608
and you wasted
the entire session
talking to Rafik?

13:05.744 --> 13:09.612
The guy’s a mid-level
bureaucratic schlub.
Actually, he’s not.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.083
Loker, can you pull up
the Camp David video?

13:12.167 --> 13:16.251
This is Yasser Arafat and
Ehud Barak at Camp David.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.164
See how they’re trying
to shove each other
through the door?

13:20.258 --> 13:22.465
[Eli]
Yeah, in the Middle East,
appearances are very important.

13:22.552 --> 13:26.136
The most p0 werfu/ person
is always the last
through the door.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.134
[ Gill/an ]
When the Yemeni delegation
entered the room,

13:28.225 --> 13:30.932
your man Hassan wasn’t
the last one through the door—
Rafik was.

13:31.019 --> 13:34.227
That’s why you cou/dn ’t
get a read
Hassan ’s a puppet.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.225
He has no idea
which demands are important.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.228
They wanted this
to go down to the wire
so they can get the best deal.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.686
They were trying to keep us
in the dark. Okay, so did you
get anything off of Rafik?

13:42.781 --> 13:45.818
Well, we got clear
vocal spikes on the demands
he cares about the most.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.945
Of course, he wasn’t
the only one.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.700
Yes, but obviously,
it goes without saying...

13:52.791 --> 13:55.077
that any deal must secure
the release of both...

13:55.168 --> 13:58.706
Nicole Braden
and her brother Marcus.

14:00.215 --> 14:03.378
We hired you to focus on
the other side ofthe table,
not ours.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.050
Well, we catch the lies
wherever they come from.

14:06.138 --> 14:09.676
And the vocal stress
in your voice...

14:09.766 --> 14:11.677
is three times higher
when you mention Nicole.

14:11.768 --> 14:17.434
You care more about
getting her released
than Marcus. Why?

14:19.526 --> 14:24.145
We can’t do ourjobs unless
we know your priorities.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.776
I’m only gonna say this once.

14:26.867 --> 14:30.109
I want Marcus released
just as much as Nicole.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.821
You got it?

14:38.462 --> 14:40.418
[Door Closes]
“I’m only gonna
say this once”?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.963
Classic qualifying statement.
He wouldn’t need it
if he was telling the truth.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.292
Will you get a hold
of Nicole and Marcus’s
confession videos?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.627
Let’s see what we can pick up.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.672
[ Chatter/ng ]
[ Woman]
No, lagree.

14:51.767 --> 14:55.009
Hey. Ijust set up
the meeting with Neeman Labs
for tomorrow morning.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.727
Yeah. Postpone it.
Well, I thought you wanted
to talk to them...

14:57.856 --> 15:00.063
about the mouse study.
Yea h. jeffrey’s
looking into it.

15:00.192 --> 15:02.649
Dr. Buchanan?
Yep.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.273
Told him about A’isha.
Told him about the study.
He said he’d look into it.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.067
What? So we’rejust
dropping it?
Yep, for now.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.366
- You think this one is ever
gonna stop talking back?
- I hope not.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.490
Half day?
[Alec]
Hope you don ’t mind

15:14.581 --> 15:17.948
Had an hour free for dinner.
Thought I’d steal her away.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.034
No problem.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.545
What?
What now?

15:27.636 --> 15:30.969
You saw her covering, right?
I mean, you saw
how upset she looked.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.012
Yeah, congratulations.
Once again,
you’ve arrived...

15:33.100 --> 15:36.388
at the apparently
foreign destination of
none ofyour damn business.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.556
[Sighs]
Man, I don’t get you.
Good.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.020
Stop trying.
Fine.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.225
Pretend like you don’t
give a damn what’s going on
with her. I know you do.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.059
Sit down.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.236
Sit down.

15:50.325 --> 15:53.567
Look. In case you haven’t
figured it out yet,

15:53.662 --> 15:56.779
it’s different when you’re one of us.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.738
Everybody has things
they don’t wish to share.

15:58.875 --> 16:03.084
She’s your friend.
You’re not listening to me.
In this workplace,

16:03.171 --> 16:08.416
with everything that we see,
we have to be very clear on the rules.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.421
You and Foster
ha ve rules?

16:10.512 --> 16:12.798
Ifthere’s something
she wants to tell me,
she will.

16:12.889 --> 16:16.598
Everything else—
Everything else I see, I ignore.

16:16.726 --> 16:20.093
I trust her to
take care of it herself.
Wow

16:20.188 --> 16:25.182
When did you get religion?
You trust Foster. You trust Buchanan.

16:25.277 --> 16:28.895
You were there.
A’isha Ward was telling the truth.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.612
Jeffrey will get
to the bottom ofthis.
He brought us the case.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.191
- Don’t you think he’sjust
a little biased?
- Okay.

16:36.663 --> 16:41.282
How many people in
this world do you trust?

16:41.418 --> 16:44.581
Howmany?
I don’t know.
Ten.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.167
Six.

16:48.258 --> 16:52.171
All right. Well,
when you get to my age,
it’ll be three.

16:52.262 --> 16:57.382
And when one ofthose people
asks you for 24 hours,
you give it to ’em.

16:59.269 --> 17:02.432
Dr. Lightman?
Uh, Dr. Buchanan
left you a message.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.520
Well, can you get him
on the line?
Yeah.

17:04.608 --> 17:07.725
But you might want to take
a look at this first.

17:14.409 --> 17:17.151
Mmm. / guess he did
get to the bottom of it.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.622
[ jeffre y ]
Rea/Av nice to meet you.
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.621
Tell Larry I’ll come back
anytime he’d like.
Thank you.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.257
Cal, what are you
doing here?
You gave up A’isha Ward.

17:33.345 --> 17:36.712
And a good evening
to you, sir.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.139
You went straight
to Vandeman.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.304
You didn’t even bother
to call.
We//, Cal,

17:42.395 --> 17:45.137
I didn’t realize we were going steady,
but I did try you at your office.

17:45.232 --> 17:49.942
Hey. There’s
serious questions here.
I stopped investigatin’.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.940
Cal, you were not hired
to investigate Ribocore.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.613
You were hired to investigate
who broke into their lab.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.783
Drug’s killing people.

17:58.870 --> 18:03.239
I have six lab reports
on Priox, including
a 9,000-person study.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.541
Priox did not cause strokes
in any ofthem.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.459
Only the knockoff
does that.

18:10.423 --> 18:14.291
Ribocore’s issued a warning,
and they’re working with police
to find the distributor.

18:14.386 --> 18:17.173
- You read through this study?
- Vandeman walked me
through them, yes.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.677
- Oh, really?
- She also showed me this.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.850
The police did
a little more digging.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.270
A’isha Ward had
$500,000 wired into
a savings account...

18:27.357 --> 18:30.520
from an offshore bank
just before the break-in.

18:30.610 --> 18:34.319
That would be four times
her annual salary.

18:35.991 --> 18:38.357
She stole the formula, Cal.
She stole it.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.659
She sold it. Now she’s trying
to cover it up.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.706
I’m not easily fooled, Jeffrey.

18:48.503 --> 18:52.712
I know. That makes her
one hell ofa liar.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.554
[ Cell Door Closes]

19:03.685 --> 19:05.721
What do you want?

19:05.812 --> 19:10.021
Well, I love being duped.
It doesn’t happen often.
But, you know, I’m intrigued.

19:10.108 --> 19:15.068
So we can either chitchat,
or... you can tell us the truth.

19:15.155 --> 19:18.113
I gave you the truth,
and you ran right back to Vandeman.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.814
You’re incredible.
She’s incredible.

19:19.909 --> 19:23.697
You’re Incredible. You know,
it’s not hard to ﬁnd a good liar.

19:23.788 --> 19:28.122
But a truly great one—
That’s rare.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.120
I am not lying.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.338
Oh, your bank statement
says you are.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.539
500 grand
wired to your account.

19:35.633 --> 19:39.217
Now, that sounds about right
for the formula
to a billion-dollar drug.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.295
So who’d you sell it to?

19:42.390 --> 19:44.767
- Doesn’t matter.
- Oh, so you admit it?

19:44.851 --> 19:47.593
- You sold the formula?
- Sure, I sold it.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.894
But I didn’t need to
break into the lab
for that.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.690
I knew the formula
by heart. I sold it months
before the break-in.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.685
So why break into
the lab at all?
Ito/dyou.

19:56.780 --> 20:00.147
I found the summary
for the mouse study.
I wanted the full report.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.948
Mouse study was an outlier.
Just one bad test.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.402
Did you talk
to Neeman Labs?

20:05.497 --> 20:08.034
That study’s evidence
that Priox is a killer.

20:08.124 --> 20:12.163
Yes, I sold the formula.
But then I found the study,
and—

20:12.253 --> 20:14.665
It tore at my conscience.
I had to do something.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.543
So first, corporate thief.

20:17.634 --> 20:21.377
Then, whistleblower.
That’s what you want us
to believe, right?

20:21.471 --> 20:26.386
Please.
Someone has to get Priox
off the market.

20:26.476 --> 20:29.183
The knockoffl sold
is the same as the real thing,

20:29.270 --> 20:32.012
and the real thing
is killing people.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.937
Go to Neeman Labs.
They’ll tell you.

20:46.496 --> 20:49.238
Thanks for seeing us
at such short notice,
Dr. Dembeck

20:49.332 --> 20:51.573
Uh, no problem.
It’s, uh—
It’s a light day.

20:51.668 --> 20:54.956
- Huh. Very light.
- I wanna ask you
a couple ofquestions...

20:55.046 --> 20:58.959
about, um,
some testing you did
on a drug called Priox.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.792
Um, I have nothing to say.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.002
Why is that?
’Cause you botched the test?

21:04.097 --> 21:07.260
Ooh. Anger’s real

21:07.350 --> 21:09.011
No shame, no guilt.

21:09.102 --> 21:11.844
Maybe Ribocore didn’t
like what they got back
in their report.

21:11.938 --> 21:16.181
So, why, did they, uh,
just drop you as a client then?

21:19.195 --> 21:22.062
They fired us. Okay?
They blackballed us...

21:22.157 --> 21:25.399
andga ve the drug to a lab
that would give them
the results that they wanted—

21:25.493 --> 21:27.279
that would test it
into compliance.

21:27.412 --> 21:30.495
And then after that,
there was no more testing on—
Priox. No.

21:30.582 --> 21:33.870
But I have heard rumors
about some of
the other studies.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.077
You know, I got into
this business to do
cutting-edge research,

21:37.172 --> 21:39.083

21:39.174 --> 21:41.540

science and business
just don’t mix.

21:48.683 --> 21:51.641
- Have you seen Dr. Lightman?
- He went down to the hospital.

What for?

21:53.313 --> 21:57.682
Our Priox victim,
Drew Coleman,
he had another stroke.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.606
He’s being taken off
life support.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.482
Oh, my God.
That’s not all

22:03.573 --> 22:05.689
I found anecdotal
evidence online.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.910
Two more stroke cases
linked to Pr/oX.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.985
Both victims young,
both in good physical shape.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.456
That’s still not gonna be enough
to get it pulled off the market.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.495
[Beeping]

22:21.591 --> 22:23.673
I’ll be right back.

22:28.389 --> 22:31.517
Hey.

22:31.601 --> 22:34.308
Torres told me you were here.
Is everything okay?

22:34.395 --> 22:36.932
Not for Mr. Coleman
itsnot

22:43.446 --> 22:46.108
Maybe A’isha Ward was right.

22:47.742 --> 22:51.075
You don’t have to do this.
Ifyou want to choose
your friendship first,

22:51.162 --> 22:53.494
you canjust hand this
over to the authorities,
let somebody else investigate it.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.663
Yeah, I’m sure they’d do
a bang-upjob.

22:55.750 --> 22:58.492
I’mjust saying that...
you can walk away.

23:00.630 --> 23:03.997
And what ifthe drug
really is killing people?
Eh?

23:07.470 --> 23:11.179
Come on.
I need to show you
something back at work.

23:14.686 --> 23:18.224
I’m so sorry
for my actions.

23:18.356 --> 23:21.723
I’m deeply,
deeply sorry.
So like I told you,

23:21.818 --> 23:24.525
we think the State Department
is more interested
in getting his sister out.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.352
Well, there’s nothing
noteworthy here.

23:26.447 --> 23:28.062
Yeah, but check out Nicole.

23:28.157 --> 23:31.399
I also apologize...

23:31.494 --> 23:34.156
and beg forgiveness.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.363
At first, we thought
it wasjust sleep deprivation.

23:36.499 --> 23:39.206
But she doesn’t look fatigued.
Yeah, no slouching,
no leaning.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.410
I mean, I guess
that could be adrenaline.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.916
No, she’s not sleep-deprived.

23:44.007 --> 23:47.170
She’s slurring
her words intentionally.

23:50.471 --> 23:53.634
The US. should leave Iraq now.

23:57.186 --> 24:01.475
Saddam Hussein is a great leader.

24:01.566 --> 24:04.933
I don’t understand.
Who is this soldier?

24:05.028 --> 24:07.610
He’s an American P.O.W.
from the first GulfWar.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.188
But what’s relevant here
is that he’s using...

24:10.283 --> 24:13.946
the same speech pattern
in his confession
that your daughter does.

24:14.037 --> 24:16.153
[Gillian]
it’s a code.
The army teaches soldiers...

24:16.247 --> 24:19.159
to slur their words if captured
or forced to give a confession.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.538
The enemy can’t hear
the difference. It signals
that they haven’t broken you.

24:22.629 --> 24:27.123
It’s part ofthe military’s
survival, evasion,
resistance and escape training.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.207
Milita/y train/ng?

24:29.302 --> 24:32.294
Neither of our children
have any military training.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.925
The State Department files
don’t mention any.

24:35.016 --> 24:36.426
I’m sorry.
What are you saying?

24:36.559 --> 24:38.470
Diane, please.
Would youjust—
Don’t do that, Robert!

24:38.561 --> 24:42.224
You’ve been telling me
to be calm this whole time.

24:42.315 --> 24:45.227
Now, Marcus
is a poetry major,
for God’s sake!

24:45.318 --> 24:47.309
What about your daughter?

24:47.403 --> 24:50.065
- This is ajoke.
- Mr. Braden?

24:50.156 --> 24:53.273
To my knowledge,
Nicole’s never been
involved with the military.

24:53.368 --> 24:57.077
“To my knowledge.”
Are you telling us everything?

24:59.582 --> 25:01.743
Robert?
[Gillian]
Mr. Braden.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.496
I can’t be effective
without all the information.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.498
/ can ’t give you all the information!

25:06.589 --> 25:09.126
Robert: what are you
talk/ng about?

25:10.885 --> 25:13.922
I can’t tell you.
I’m not supposed to know.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.299
I’d be breaking the law.

25:16.391 --> 25:18.757
She’s U.S. Intelligence.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.842
She’s a spy.

25:27.110 --> 25:29.021
What the hell were you thinking?

25:29.112 --> 25:32.400
- Uh, excuse me?
- Our firm has a reputation
for discretion.

25:32.490 --> 25:36.108
You have secrets, you tell us!
Otherwise, we can’t do ourjob!

25:36.202 --> 25:38.033
I still don’t know
what you’re talking about.

25:38.121 --> 25:42.364
You know exactly
what I’m talking about.
Nicole Braden... is a spy.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.574
How was I supposed
to tell you that?

25:44.669 --> 25:48.378
It’s classified information.
Get a lot of people killed,
including Nicole.

25:48.464 --> 25:49.965
I wish I had known that earlier.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.914
Yeah? Well, maybe now
you’ll understand why
I’m taking the deal.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.376
- Wait. What deal?
- Rafik called an hour ago.

25:55.471 --> 25:59.055
He’s offering to hand over
one ofthe prisoners in exchange
for their humanitarian demands.

25:59.142 --> 26:04.728
We ’re getting Nico/e back
We’ll do what we can
for Marcus.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.430
No, that is a terrible call.

26:07.525 --> 26:10.437
It’ll tear the family apart.
Nicole will never be able
to live with herself.

26:10.528 --> 26:13.440
Do you understand?
That woman knows the address...

26:13.531 --> 26:15.442
to every C.I.A. safe house
in the Middle East.

26:15.533 --> 26:18.024
And you’re worried about
herfeelings?

26:19.620 --> 26:22.703
Rafik’s demanding
patriot missiles for Marcus.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.746
So it’s a nonstarter.
We’re done here.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.826
I am getting Nicole
back home...

26:27.920 --> 26:30.502
before the Yemenis
find out who she is,
and that is it.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.971
Dr. Foster.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.968
Mr. Braden.
What are you doing here?

26:42.059 --> 26:44.926
The, uh, State Department
hasn’t been returning my calls.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.636
I didn’t know
where else to go.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.722
This is Miss McDermott
from the Red Cross.

26:48.816 --> 26:52.479
One oftheir nurses
was allowed to visit
Marcus yesterday,

26:52.570 --> 26:54.526
and she managed
to get these photos out.

27:08.836 --> 27:12.044
What happened?
[McDermott]
Apparently, he tried to escape.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.873
The Yemeni guards
beat h/m se vere/y.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.925
He has broken ribs
and a concussion.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.253
He hasn’t been allowed
to see a doctor.

27:20.348 --> 27:23.465
Our nurse demanded that...

27:23.559 --> 27:27.393
Marcus be transferred
to a medical facility
for treatment.

27:27.480 --> 27:32.520
She was told there was
no point in treating him.

27:35.696 --> 27:38.904
He’s gonna be sentenced tomorrow.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.738
And then,
they’re gonna execute him.

27:44.956 --> 27:47.288
They’re gonna shoot my son.

27:49.126 --> 27:53.369
Please.
You gotta get him out.

27:57.260 --> 28:01.048
You need to raise
the acidity ifyou want it
to act as a compound.

28:01.138 --> 28:04.630
Oh! A scientist
and a businesswoman.

28:04.767 --> 28:08.180
No wonderJeffrey
was such an advocate.
Dr. Lightman. Miss Torres.

28:08.312 --> 28:11.179
This is a pleasant surprise.
I’m sorry about
the unexpected pop in.

28:11.274 --> 28:15.313
But I find the more time
one has to prepare a lie,
the harder it is for me to spot.

28:16.404 --> 28:20.192
Okay. Would you excuse us
for a moment?

28:20.283 --> 28:24.117
- See you later.
- So, what can I do for you?

28:24.203 --> 28:27.161
Oh, well, um,
some ofthe
pharmaceuticaljournals...

28:27.248 --> 28:29.159
found out
I was involved in the case,

28:29.250 --> 28:31.081
and they called with
a couple questions.

28:31.168 --> 28:34.581
So I thought I’djust
run a few things by you.

28:34.672 --> 28:37.630
Sure.
I appreciate that.

28:38.801 --> 28:40.757
Uh— Well, first then,

28:42.179 --> 28:45.546
the real Priox
versus the knockoffdrug.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.552
What exactly
is the difference?

28:47.643 --> 28:50.885
Well, it’s complicated.
It has to do with the way
that you run the compound.

28:50.980 --> 28:54.063
All right, well, try me.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.562
I was quite a chemist
back at Oxford.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.769
There ’s certain
proprie ta/y information.

28:59.864 --> 29:01.855
Why don’t you have thejournals
refer to me on that one?

29:01.991 --> 29:06.325
Okay.
How about the mouse study
Ms. Ward keeps mentioning?

29:06.412 --> 29:10.075
There’s nothing to it.
No other Priox testing
showed any side effects.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.202
And all these labs,
they’re on the up-and—up, right?

29:14.420 --> 29:18.129
I am intimately involved
with every one ofthose companies.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.752
I trust them all.

29:20.843 --> 29:24.085
Well, that’s good
Because it’s quite hard
to ﬁnd a company...

29:24.180 --> 29:26.671
one can trust these days, right?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.722
Hmm.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.936
So she bit her lip
every time I went at her.

29:31.020 --> 29:34.387
- Incred/blv anxious that woman.
- I don’t know how we missed it earlier.

29:34.482 --> 29:39.522
Well, lie detection’s
all about asking
the right questions.

29:39.612 --> 29:42.103
What a shame. They were
paying top dollar too.
[ Cell Phone Dial/ng]

29:42.239 --> 29:44.150
You calling reporters?
No. I made them up.

29:44.241 --> 29:48.735
Uh, Vandeman will be
trying to track ’em down,
which will buy us a little time.

29:48.829 --> 29:50.410
Time for what?

29:50.498 --> 29:52.454
Heidi? Yeah.

29:52.541 --> 29:55.624
Can you make an appointment
withJim Gunderson
over at the FDA?

29:55.711 --> 29:59.374
Tell him it’s urgent,
all right? Yeah.
I’m on my way back.

30:00.967 --> 30:04.255
It’s mice, Cal.
It’s one study.

30:04.345 --> 30:06.256
Yeah, well, Vandeman’s
lying about the other tests.

30:06.347 --> 30:09.339
Well, even ifyou’re right,
there’s not enough here
to pull Priox off the market.

30:09.433 --> 30:12.345
I can start an investigation,
but I can’t do more than that.

30:12.436 --> 30:15.394
F.D.A. investigations
take months. A lot
of people could die,Jim.

30:15.481 --> 30:18.894
Ifyou can prove Vandeman
manipulated the testing,
I’ll recall the drug immediately.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.567
But without more hard data,
my hands are tied.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.986
All right, well, uh,
do you mind if
/use your name?

30:24.073 --> 30:27.156
Throw it around,
see if! can
open a few doors?

30:27.243 --> 30:29.154
You should start with
yourfriend Buchanan.

30:29.245 --> 30:31.281
He was a driving force
behind the drug’s approval.

30:31.372 --> 30:33.533
Buchanan pushed the drug?
Yeah.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.580
I can show you about
a dozen letters he submitted
on behalf of Priox.

30:35.668 --> 30:38.125
You do know he’s on
the Ribocore payroll?

30:38.212 --> 30:40.703
But he’s not
involved in this.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.709
Jeffrey encouraged me
to come and talk to you.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.257
I mean, he’s as eager
to get to the bottom
ofthis as we are.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.757
“Jeffrey encouraged me
to come see you”?

30:52.893 --> 30:54.849
The walls of
the FDA. have ears.
Yeah.

30:54.937 --> 30:57.474
Well, then I’m sure
they could tell
you were lying too.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.396
Hey, ifJeffrey knew
what was going on,

30:59.483 --> 31:01.394
he would’ve come
to the FDA. himself.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.817
The guy’s on the payroll.
He pushed the drug
through F.D.A. approvals.

31:03.904 --> 31:09.274
- You can’t really believe that.
- You know, if it was someone
in yourfamily, right,

31:09.368 --> 31:11.575
how much proofwould you need
before you hung ’em out?

31:11.704 --> 31:15.993
|_
Look, ifJeffrey knows
about Priox, he’s going tojail.

31:16.083 --> 31:19.325
But I’m gonna be damn sure
before I send him there.
All right?

31:19.420 --> 31:21.581
Okay.
Good.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.423
Ithought
you said Peters
was making the deal?

31:30.514 --> 31:32.379
Well,
just because he’s done
doesn’t mean we are.

31:32.516 --> 31:35.974
He’s almost comical
with the sound off.
I’m trying to concentrate here.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.927
What? He’s got
the best posture
I’ve ever seen.

31:38.064 --> 31:42.148
He looks like Mussolini.
Well, he’s trying to
make himself look bigger.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.395
You know, men,
gorillas, blowfish—

31:44.487 --> 31:47.820
You know, when they want
to appear dominant,
they puffthemselves up.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.865
This guy’s
definitely compensating
for something.

31:53.287 --> 31:55.494
Maybe you’re
onto something.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.907
Rafik really cares
about appearances.

32:00.002 --> 32:02.709
He wants to look
like a leader.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.042
That could be our leverage.

32:08.385 --> 32:12.344
[ Gill/an ]
Hey, Ithought / heard you
come back in. Where’s Torres?

32:12.431 --> 32:15.173
/ sent her off
to talk to the labs...

32:15.267 --> 32:18.555
that tested Priox.

32:18.646 --> 32:21.433
You know, Jeffrey always
loved the limelight. I can’t
tell you how many times...

32:21.524 --> 32:24.357
I’d come home,
switched on the news,
and there he is...

32:24.443 --> 32:26.354
in my living room...

32:26.445 --> 32:28.310
pushing some new drug
or other.

32:28.447 --> 32:33.737
Cal—
Merry-go—round of government,
business and media.

32:33.828 --> 32:36.160
Enough money and fame
to make your head spin,
I suppose.

32:36.247 --> 32:38.533
Do you really think
Jeffrey’s guilty?

32:38.624 --> 32:41.036
I don’t know.

32:42.545 --> 32:44.877
I don’t know.

32:46.215 --> 32:48.126
You know,
when my mother died

32:48.217 --> 32:51.254
Jeffrey took the train
back to London with me.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.463
And I’d only known him
for about a month.

32:55.558 --> 33:01.053
But he skipped out of college
and came with me
just to keep me company.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.941
So honestly, I don’t know.
[Knocking]

33:08.028 --> 33:09.984
[Ria ]
Hey.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.063
I’ve got something
you should see.

33:13.242 --> 33:15.278
So I went to all six
Priox testing labs.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.985
I didn’t get anything
until I talked to
the researcher at the lab...

33:18.080 --> 33:20.742
that did the
9,000-person study.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.957
Did he show signs
ofdeception leakage?
Yeah.

33:23.043 --> 33:25.079
He looked like
he was about to hurl.
So I came back,

33:25.171 --> 33:27.833
pulled a video of Vandeman
talking about that study.

33:27.923 --> 33:31.086
Priox promises
to help the millions
living with diabetes.

33:31.177 --> 33:36.547
An intensive
9,000-person study—
[ Ria ] Same hp bite.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.382
She does it every time
she talks about that study.

33:39.476 --> 33:43.936
And given the depth
and the breadth ofthis
9,000-person study—

33:44.023 --> 33:47.311
/ust like today.
She is totally ﬁ‘eaked out.

33:47.401 --> 33:51.485
Yeah, well...
she’s not the only one.

33:54.742 --> 33:57.654
[ Ria ] What? He ’syust
staring at the ﬂoor.
Yeah, watch.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.872
[ Cal]
He looks at her when
she ’s talk/ng about the study,

34:03.959 --> 34:08.248
and then catches her eye,
and then looks down and away.

34:08.339 --> 34:09.829
Signs of—
Guilt.

34:09.924 --> 34:11.915
Yeah.

34:13.928 --> 34:15.668
I’m sorry.

34:18.307 --> 34:20.298
Yeah, me too.

34:30.319 --> 34:32.605
Where did you dig this up?

34:32.696 --> 34:36.985
I still remember you
bounding into morning lab
straight from the poker tables,

34:37.076 --> 34:40.068
having hustled somejackass
out ofa hundred pounds.

34:40.162 --> 34:42.403
Seems like
a thousand years ago.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.830
Yeah, I could read you
backthen.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.908
Not as well as you thought.

34:52.299 --> 34:56.508
- What?
- Spoke to Gunderson
at the FDA.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.337
We know
the 9,000-person study
is a sham.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.342
So ifyou’ve got
an ything to say,
you should say it now

35:01.433 --> 35:04.470
- Cal, I have no idea
what you’re talking about.
- She’s selling a killer drug.

35:04.561 --> 35:07.428
We spoke to
the testing labs.
We watched her on tape.

35:07.523 --> 35:11.812
A’isha Ward was telling
the truth about Priox.
Vandeman’s lying.

35:11.902 --> 35:14.063
Are you serious?

35:14.154 --> 35:17.146
Yeah. And I know
you’re helping her.

35:17.241 --> 35:19.778
- And you think that I would
do something like that?
- Tell me it’s not true.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.779
- It’s not true.
- You’re lying.
I can see it in your face.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.997
- No, I’m not!
- Yeah, you are.
You’re covering.

35:24.081 --> 35:26.823
- You are unbelievable.
- I saw the guilty look you had
when you watched Vandeman.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.532
You’re involved in this.

35:30.337 --> 35:33.204
[Chuckles]
There’s no “this,” Cal.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.290
Okay?

35:36.468 --> 35:38.800
Erica and I
are having an affair.

35:38.887 --> 35:42.254
That’s it. We ’re having an aha/r.
Okay? You happy now?

35:42.391 --> 35:45.724
You’re cheating on Sarah?
Oh, you’re gonna lecture me
about marriage now?

35:45.811 --> 35:48.177
’Cause you know what?
That would be rich.

35:48.272 --> 35:53.062
You really had no idea
she was manipulating the data?

35:53.152 --> 35:57.236
You know something?
For somebody who’s studied
emotions their entire life,

35:57.323 --> 36:01.236
you really don’t
understand them at all.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.284
You have to stay
away from her, Jeffrey.
Okay.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.991
I mean it.
This investigation’s gonna get ugly.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.998
Erica’s going tojail.
You can’t call her.
You can’t e-mail her.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.126
You can’t be near her
when that happens.
I mean it. Stay away from her.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.803
Thanks for
the friendly advice.

36:33.108 --> 36:37.272
Mr. Peters,
I just got your message.
I thought we had a deal.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.103
We have another proposal.

36:39.198 --> 36:41.780
There’s only an hour
until sentencing.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.574
Please, hear us out.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.993
I’m listening.

36:47.081 --> 36:51.620
In return for
the pardon and release of
Nicole and Marcus Braden,

36:51.710 --> 36:55.623
the United States is prepared
to meet all onemen’s
humanitarian demands.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.544
This is an insult.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.296
Ambassador Rafik.

37:03.680 --> 37:07.138
To thank you for putting aside
your military demands,

37:07.226 --> 37:09.763
