00:11.302 --> 00:14.889
[somber music]

00:14.931 --> 00:16.725
- You gotta be kidding me.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.104
"Removed from major platforms."

00:21.146 --> 00:22.689
"Cancelled."

00:22.731 --> 00:24.190
Fuck.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.109
[knocking]

00:29.654 --> 00:31.114
Oh. Hey.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.449
- Hi.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.409
- Uh, Ava's out with Tory.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.746
- Oh, that's okay.
I'm here to see you.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.581
- Come on in.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.585
Is everything okay?

00:43.626 --> 00:45.754
Can I get you something
to drink?

00:47.130 --> 00:49.049
- I know about the podcast.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.343
- About the podcast?
What podcast?

00:51.384 --> 00:53.470
- You're
"Based on a True Story,"

00:53.511 --> 00:57.432
and you made a deal
with the Westside Ripper.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.059
- Um, well--
- Mm-mm.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.227
I saw the texts.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.188
- Look, we were cancelled.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.023
Okay? We're cancelled.
It's over.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.068
There's--there's nothing
to talk about.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.402
- I know how to save it.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.738
- You know how to save
the podcast?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.615
- [laughs] Can we sit?

01:13.656 --> 01:15.033
- Uh, yeah. Sure.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.118
Um...

01:17.160 --> 01:18.870
have a seat.

01:20.288 --> 01:23.541
- So here's what I'm thinking.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.378
Your brand is
you're these rebels,

01:26.419 --> 01:28.254
right, these rulebreakers?

01:28.296 --> 01:29.673
So fuck the system.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.800
Fuck Apple.
You can make your own platform.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.677
There's no ads, no sponsors.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.513
You just charge fans
to join up.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.932
- Like a subscription.
- Exactly like a subscription.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.059
Ten bucks a month,
you'll be raking it in,

01:41.101 --> 01:42.727
and, best of all,

01:42.769 --> 01:45.814
you won't have to answer
to anybody.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.190
- And what do you get?

01:47.232 --> 01:50.568
- Uh, just a small,
little piece.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.321
I stay quiet,
we all make money.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.281
Easy.
- What are you doing?

01:55.323 --> 01:56.783
Don't--
I don't think you should--

01:56.825 --> 01:59.619
- Just put me in, Coach.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.292
Just put it in, Coach.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.294
- Uh, you--
you should leave.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.964
- Okay. I'll leave.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.049
- Oh, fuck.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.677
[sighs]
[Ruby moans]

02:15.719 --> 02:17.804
[whispering] Go.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.432
Go. Go away.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.184
Go away.
- What?

02:23.226 --> 02:24.894
- Oh, nothing.
The dog's watching.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.563
- What dog?

02:26.604 --> 02:29.441
- [sighs]
Nothing. McEnroe.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.320
Oh, God.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.239
[whispering]
Get outta here. Go.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.615
[door opens]
Go. Don't lick me.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.827
- Why?
- No, I mean the dog.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.037
- What are you doing?

02:42.078 --> 02:43.997
- Uh, nothing.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.540
- What are you doing?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.921
- I know how to save
the podcast.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.300
[ominous music]

02:55.342 --> 02:58.386
- So...

02:58.428 --> 03:02.640
it's like Substack
for podcasts?

03:02.682 --> 03:05.185
Totally subscription-based?

03:05.226 --> 03:07.395
- Exactly.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.856
- I fucking love it.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.360
Yeah. Yeah.
It's totally on-brand.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.070
Fuck the woke police.
We don't need 'em.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.363
- Don't need 'em.
- It's genius.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.323
- Thank you.
Thank you, Matt.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.824
- Yeah.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.744
- You just came up
with all of this in a dream?

03:22.786 --> 03:24.371
- Crazy, right?

03:28.249 --> 03:30.293
- Hey, Nate,
you wanna throw tonight?

03:30.335 --> 03:32.253
- Oh, tonight.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.631
Tonight, like, I--jeez.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.966
Tonight.
Do we have a thing tonight?

03:37.008 --> 03:38.635
- No. I mean, yes.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.095
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You do?

03:40.136 --> 03:42.430
Hey, hey, uh...

03:42.472 --> 03:44.724
do you remember that
crazy Simon guy,

03:44.766 --> 03:46.393
how he was gonna--
what was he?

03:46.434 --> 03:48.144
He was gonna blow
your fucking brains out

03:48.186 --> 03:49.854
and I saved your ass?
- Yes.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.940
Yes, and I really
appreciate it.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.358
I do. I just--

03:53.400 --> 03:55.944
I can't throw tonight.
I'm sorry.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.824
- Yeah. Okay.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.575
Yeah, fine.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.077
That's fine.
That is fine.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.453
It is. [chuckles]

04:05.495 --> 04:06.913
Oh, guys, you know what?

04:06.955 --> 04:09.582
If we're gonna do
this new model,

04:09.624 --> 04:11.626
we should have, like,
a premium level.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.337
You know, like, uh,
"Ripper Superfans."

04:14.379 --> 04:15.922
You know?
We give them an early heads-up

04:15.964 --> 04:17.298
on upcoming content.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.092
I think they'd
really love that.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.260
- What?

04:20.301 --> 04:22.637
- I just really miss
murdering people.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.763
- Hmm?

04:23.805 --> 04:25.849
- Look, it's who I am.
It's what I do.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.059
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- But guys. Guys.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.395
I've actually already
chosen someone.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.396
- What?

04:31.438 --> 04:33.648
- And, spoiler.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.525
You're gonna love it.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.152
- What does that mean?
- So I'm gonna do my thing,

04:37.193 --> 04:38.528
we'll regroup, touch base--

04:38.570 --> 04:39.446
- What do you mean,
you're gonna do your thing?

04:39.487 --> 04:40.488
- See how you feel.
- No.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.573
- Let's just call
a time-out here.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.782
- Maybe we touch base now.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.159
- I can't. I'm busy.
I'm sorry.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.869
Okay.
- Can we--

04:45.910 --> 04:48.204
[tense music]

04:48.246 --> 04:49.497
- Matt?

04:53.626 --> 04:56.171
[pensive music]

04:56.212 --> 04:57.464
- What are we gonna do?

04:57.505 --> 04:59.007
He won't stop talking
about his "new content."

04:59.049 --> 05:00.800
- He's gonna announce it
on the podcast.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.677
So it takes weeks.
We got time.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.096
- A-and Ruby?
What are we gonna do about her?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.598
- We gotta cut her in.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.643
We got no choice.
We "Godfather" it, okay?

05:10.685 --> 05:12.979
We bring her in close,
keep an eye on her.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.148
- No. You know what happens
when you bring Ruby in close?

05:15.190 --> 05:16.983
Someone ends up
with a fantastic blow job,

05:17.025 --> 05:20.362
and that someone
is not gonna be me.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.905
- Okay. So what's your idea?

05:21.946 --> 05:23.907
- We keep her the fuck out,
okay?

05:23.948 --> 05:26.910
And if she comes at us,
then we'll deal with it then.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.998
- Wouldn't have this problem
if you didn't drop the burner.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.875
- Are you serious?
Is that what this is about?

05:33.917 --> 05:36.419
The burner?

05:36.461 --> 05:38.546
- [sighs]

05:38.588 --> 05:40.382
I wanted to get
the dog out of there,

05:40.423 --> 05:43.218
and you knew it.
I told you five times.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.552
- Okay. So this is my fault.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.137
- I asked you to take
the dog out.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.765
You kept saying no.
So whose fault is that?

05:48.807 --> 05:52.352
[soft dramatic music]

05:52.394 --> 05:53.853
I'm outta here.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.313
- Hey.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.357
* *

05:57.399 --> 06:00.026
Don't do this! Please, come on!

06:00.068 --> 06:01.569
[door slams]

06:05.031 --> 06:05.949
[knob creaks]

06:21.131 --> 06:22.716
[yelps]

06:22.757 --> 06:24.509
[up-tempo percussive music]
Oh.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.930
[moaning]

06:28.972 --> 06:33.226
* *

06:33.268 --> 06:35.937
[breathing heavily]

06:39.357 --> 06:40.859
Oh.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.862
[moans]
- Oh, my God.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.905
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God! Ahh!

06:45.947 --> 06:47.073
- My eyes!
Oh, my God!

06:47.115 --> 06:48.074
I can't see!

06:48.116 --> 06:49.576
- Get away!
What are you doing?

06:49.617 --> 06:51.202
- My eyes!
- What is wrong with you?

06:51.244 --> 06:52.412
- What is wrong with you?

06:52.454 --> 06:53.997
Don't you have, like,
a job or something?

06:54.039 --> 06:55.373
How do you have time
to do that?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.875
- Oh, my God.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.752
- That was, like, something out
of "National Geographic."

06:58.793 --> 07:00.545
- What are you even doing
in here?

07:00.587 --> 07:02.714
This is a jerk-off zone.
Everyone knows that.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.674
- Well, my jerk-off zone
is broken.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.135
This house is falling apart.
- God.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.137
- How did you even get
your hand down there?

07:09.179 --> 07:11.097
- I'm pregnant.
I'm not paralyzed.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.932
- Yeah, no, you're definitely
not paralyzed.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.602
There's a lot of fast,
record-breaking action

07:15.643 --> 07:17.145
going on down there.
- Okay, you know what?

07:17.187 --> 07:18.938
I'm not gonna be
pregnant-shamed by you.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.358
I'm normal.
Everything I did was normal.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.776
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.611
- Okay. What's the hot
new trends in pregnancy sex?

07:24.652 --> 07:25.904
Please enlighten me.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.739
- Oh, wow.
A lot of things, actually.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.074
A lot of hot, sexy,
exciting things.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.408
You wouldn't be able
to handle it.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.744
- Well, I guess it is like
an instant threesome.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.204
- You're disgusting!

07:34.245 --> 07:35.747
- You were getting
pretty into it down there,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.457
you and the fetus.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.750
Who's the third party?
- Okay.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.085
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you.
Sure.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.296
- Wait, so it's, like--
like, a secret fantasy?

07:43.338 --> 07:45.131
So not the husband.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.008
- Be quiet.
- Who's in the rotation?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.259
- I'm not telling you.
- Tell me.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.053
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.
- Okay, whatever.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.262
Whatever. Fine.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.306
He's a--he's a buyer
that I'm working with.

07:53.348 --> 07:57.018
I'm actually seeing him
later today again.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.812
- You're seeing him again?
- I'm not seeing him.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.146
I show him houses, okay?

08:00.188 --> 08:02.482
So I've been seeing
more of him.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.900
But, no.
It's nothing.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.403
He just happens to be
hot and young and very rich

08:06.444 --> 08:07.779
and, you know, whatever.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.614
So when I enter
my jerk-off zone,

08:09.656 --> 08:11.116
he pops into my head.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.618
It's not a big deal.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.203
- Can I give you some
really good advice?

08:15.245 --> 08:16.705
- No.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.665
- You keep meeting up
with this secret fantasy guy

08:18.707 --> 08:20.125
in these big, sexy houses,

08:20.166 --> 08:22.502
you're gonna end up
having sex--

08:22.544 --> 08:25.588
like, weird sex--

08:25.630 --> 08:27.340
for real.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.343
[soft suspenseful music]

08:30.385 --> 08:35.598
* *

08:35.640 --> 08:37.934
- Hey, what's up, Coach?

08:37.976 --> 08:39.978
- Hey.
- How you doing?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.188
- Finally fixing the crack.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.358
- Yeah, man.
The pickleball guys complained.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.818
I mean, they get shit done.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.986
- Wait, what?
The pickleballers?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.404
- Yeah.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.531
- I've been trying to get
this crack fixed for weeks.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.991
- They're pouring cement
tomorrow, man.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.576
I mean,
this whole fucking court

08:54.617 --> 08:56.327
is gonna be
exclusively pickleball.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.455
- This is court number one.
They can't do that.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.832
- It's like tennis but smaller.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.334
- Fucking pickleballers.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.543
- Nathan.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.045
Nathan.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.339
- Michelle, court one can't
be used for pickleball.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.715
- It doesn't matter. Listen.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.718
Um, do you remember vouching
for your friend Matt?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.345
You said he was good people.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.929
- I never said that.
- Was that bro code

09:14.971 --> 09:17.015
for he's a fucking asshole?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.892
Because he's a douche.
Yeah.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.102
He ditched me
for no fucking reason,

09:21.144 --> 09:25.357
and he kept telling me that
I was a "dead end."

09:25.398 --> 09:27.025
- A dead end?
- Yeah.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.486
One minute we're having a great
time watching "FBoy Island,"

09:29.527 --> 09:33.239
and the next minute he had
this ice-cold look in his eyes

09:33.281 --> 09:34.616
like a total psycho,

09:34.657 --> 09:37.077
and then he said, "It's over.
You're a dead end,"

09:37.118 --> 09:40.538
over and over again.
What the fuck does that mean?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.083
- I have no idea.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.044
He's going after Michelle.
She's the new content.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.796
She's the fucking one.
What do we do?

09:47.837 --> 09:50.465
Should we warn her?
Call me when you get this.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.633
Okay.
[thwack]

09:56.763 --> 09:58.598
- Help! Help!

09:58.640 --> 10:00.600
- Shut the fuck up.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.602
I will fucking kill you.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.772

10:28.670 --> 10:30.296
- What the fuck is this?

10:30.338 --> 10:33.717
- This was part of the deal,
remember?

10:33.758 --> 10:36.219
We still throw.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.013
And, to be honest, Nate,

10:38.054 --> 10:40.598
you look like you need
some time with a buddy.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.143
You're still blue, right?

10:43.184 --> 10:44.394
- No.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.687
No fucking way.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.565
First we need to talk
about this new content.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.109
- First we're gonna throw.

11:01.036 --> 11:01.828
See?

11:01.870 --> 11:04.372
Fun, right?

11:04.414 --> 11:06.166
You know, Nate,

11:06.207 --> 11:08.168
I gotta tell ya,

11:08.209 --> 11:11.046
when you guys first came
to me with this,

11:11.087 --> 11:13.340
I thought one of us would
be dead in a week.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.425
I mean...

11:15.467 --> 11:18.636
[softly] Probably you
if I'm honest, right?

11:18.678 --> 11:22.015
But I gotta say, this podcast--

11:22.057 --> 11:24.934
it is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.520
I've got thousands of fans
reaching out,

11:27.562 --> 11:31.900
and I can just be the real me
for the first time,

11:31.941 --> 11:34.235
and that is all--

11:34.277 --> 11:35.904
all thanks to you.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.865
- I-I don't think
it's thanks to me.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.742
- No, no, no.
No, it is.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.078
Totally.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.789
Nate...

11:45.830 --> 11:50.543
you have given me the life
I always wanted,

11:50.585 --> 11:52.921
and so I wanna help you out.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.923
Now, I know you're going
through some stuff--

11:54.964 --> 11:57.008
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.885
- You wanna know
what I discovered

11:58.927 --> 12:01.262
when I followed my passion?

12:01.304 --> 12:04.057
Sacrifices--
they have to be made.

12:04.099 --> 12:07.394
And I lost a few people
that I love.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.854
And you--

12:09.896 --> 12:11.648
I know you loved that dog.

12:11.690 --> 12:12.982
- Don't talk about my dog.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.193
- No, no, but you can't
blame yourself.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.779
That's just the world
throwing shit at you,

12:17.821 --> 12:18.780
and that's what it does when

12:18.822 --> 12:19.948
you're on the top
of the mountain,

12:19.989 --> 12:21.616
and that's where you are,
buddy.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.368
You're on the top, all right?

12:23.410 --> 12:26.079
It's gonna test you,
it's gonna tempt you,

12:26.121 --> 12:29.541
but you and Ava--
you just gotta stay tight.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.877
- My marriage is none
of your fucking business.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.963
Do you understand me?

12:35.005 --> 12:38.508
- Yeah. I got it.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.177
- I know about Michelle.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.012
- What?

12:42.053 --> 12:43.972
- You're gonna kill her.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.727
- Okay, but look.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.729
Really, it benefits all of us.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.855
- Please.
- Hey.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.106
- Please no.
- Listen to me.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.691
It's gonna really help
with the spin-offs.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.152
- No fucking spin-offs.
There's no new content.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.778
- As a friend,
you've gotta listen to me, okay?

12:58.820 --> 13:00.780
It's not your fault, all right?
- What are you talking about?

13:00.822 --> 13:02.782
- Look, you didn't know
what that guy was gonna do.

13:02.824 --> 13:03.950
- What guy?
- Okay, sure.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.618
You put the dog in the room.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.661
- [grunts]

13:14.836 --> 13:17.422
- There it is.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.299
There it is.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.468
There's the guy that
beat Federer.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.639
You feel that?

13:26.681 --> 13:29.559
That killer instinct?

13:29.601 --> 13:31.603
It's back.

13:34.105 --> 13:38.151
- All right, and here we have
your sauna, of course,

13:38.193 --> 13:40.695
and this beautiful
cascading waterfall

13:40.737 --> 13:42.781
into your private Jacuzzi,

13:42.822 --> 13:45.867
and a gorgeous
ten-person shower.

13:46.826 --> 13:47.994
Yeah.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.038
[suspenseful percussive music]

13:50.080 --> 13:52.499
[softly] Oh, my God.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.250
- Whew.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.461
- [clears throat]
Yeah.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.380
* *

13:58.421 --> 14:01.174
Oh.

14:01.216 --> 14:04.344
- Uh, it's a whole lot
of shower.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.596
- Uh-huh.

14:06.638 --> 14:12.310
* *

14:12.352 --> 14:13.603
- Okay, okay.
I'm sorry.

14:13.645 --> 14:14.562
We just--I gotta--

14:14.604 --> 14:15.647
we gotta get this
out in the open.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.856
We gotta talk.
We gotta talk right now,

14:16.898 --> 14:18.233
because I can't take it
anymore,

14:18.274 --> 14:21.569
and I think we both know
what's going on here.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.698
We are both clearly
very hot for each other,

14:24.739 --> 14:26.783
and if we keep meeting in these
big, sexy, beautiful homes,

14:26.825 --> 14:28.993
you and I are gonna end up
in one of these big showers,

14:29.035 --> 14:30.537
tearing each other's
clothes off,

14:30.578 --> 14:32.872
having amazing sex,
and coming, like, ten times.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.874
And I can't do that.
I am married.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.711
I love my husband, even though
that would be incredibly hot

14:37.752 --> 14:39.129
and sexy and sweaty

14:39.170 --> 14:40.922
and all the things
that you want it to be.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.340
But it's not gonna happen.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.259
And I'm sorry, sir,
but that is--

14:44.300 --> 14:46.386
it's--that's just what it is.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.304
Ugh!

14:48.346 --> 14:51.766
Glad we got that
off our chests, huh?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.560
- Uh, yeah.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.105
I-I have no idea what
you're talking about at all.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.315
- What?

14:59.357 --> 15:00.650
- So I just thought
you'd be a good agent.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.069
I don't--I don't need to come--
ten times?

15:03.111 --> 15:06.197
Was that it?
I just need a house. That's--

15:06.239 --> 15:07.240
- You're fucking kidding,
right?

15:07.282 --> 15:09.242
- No.
- You haven't had the--

15:09.284 --> 15:11.244
you haven't thought
the things that I'm--

15:11.286 --> 15:14.080
that I thought?
You haven't--

15:14.122 --> 15:15.874
- Not even once.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.334
- Oh.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.961
- You're pretty, though.
- Oh, my fucking God.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.588
- [clears throat]
- Sure I can't get you a drink?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.423
- I'm good, thank you.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.679
- So what's this about?

16:13.056 --> 16:15.684
- I know Ava told you.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.771
That I know about the podcast.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.233
- I think you should come back
when Ava's here

16:23.274 --> 16:25.068
and we can all talk about it.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.028
- Yeah. Yeah, no,

16:27.070 --> 16:28.988
I already tried that
at the party.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.323
She wasn't interested.

16:30.365 --> 16:33.159
- Well, then that's it.
If Ava's out, I'm out.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.494
- Well, just hear me out.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.872
You guys have put me
in a really bad spot here.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.791
- We have?
- Yeah.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.668
- We're the only three people
on the planet

16:41.710 --> 16:44.129
who know who the
Westside Ripper is, right?

16:44.170 --> 16:46.506
And the only reason that you
guys aren't going to the police

16:46.548 --> 16:49.384
is because of the podcast,
but, see,

16:49.426 --> 16:52.178
I don't have the podcast.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.223
So I'm thinking I should just
turn this guy in,

16:55.265 --> 16:56.474
otherwise I'm just
letting him kill

16:56.516 --> 16:58.435
more innocent people, right?

16:58.476 --> 17:00.311
- He's not killing anyone.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.521
- Are you sure about that?

17:01.563 --> 17:04.190
- Okay, Ruby, let's--
let's--come on.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.525
Let's work together on this.

17:05.567 --> 17:09.446
What if--what if we gave you,
um...

17:09.487 --> 17:11.698
50,000 per episode?

17:11.740 --> 17:14.159
- [scoffs]

17:14.200 --> 17:16.870
Do you think I came here
to ask you for money?

17:16.911 --> 17:19.247
No, I don't need money.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.042
I want a front-row seat
to the Westside Ripper

17:22.083 --> 17:25.420
becoming the biggest celebrity
on this fucking planet.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.714
- That's what you want?

17:27.756 --> 17:29.883
- I mean,

17:29.924 --> 17:32.218
isn't that why you did it?

[soft suspenseful music]

17:35.055 --> 17:36.389

17:36.431 --> 17:38.433
- Ava's gonna be back
any minute.

17:38.475 --> 17:42.729
- Nate, do you remember
what you told me in Vegas

17:42.771 --> 17:45.148
on the dance floor?

17:45.190 --> 17:49.402
I would love it if the three
of us could do this together.

17:49.444 --> 17:52.447
And I was thinking that...

17:54.699 --> 17:58.828
Maybe you could talk
to Ava about it?

17:58.870 --> 18:01.081
Wouldn't that be fun?

Hi. I got your message.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.825
- It's all good.
Michelle's safe.

18:36.866 --> 18:37.992
I talked to Matt.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.160
- Oh, okay.
What happened?

18:39.202 --> 18:40.912
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

18:40.954 --> 18:43.081
- I'm gonna--
hey, I'm gonna blindfold you.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.332
- You're not putting that
on me.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.459
- Well, I gotta--I'm gonna--
- No.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.044
- Okay, I gotta put it on
in the car.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.129
I gotta--
- I'm not putting that on.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.422
- I--just trust me.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.756
I got a surprise for you.
- I don't think so.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.717
- Just--just trust me.
Just put it on in the car.

- I got you.

19:04.352 --> 19:07.147

But where are we?

19:07.188 --> 19:08.481
- Okay.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.191
- All right. Come on.

Where are we?
- Okay.

- What?
- Our Malibu dream house.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.452
I've been tracking it
for a while.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.578
I just pulled the trigger.

19:21.619 --> 19:22.620
It's a lease
with an option to buy

19:22.662 --> 19:23.830
in case you don't love it.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.665
- Well, I--
of course I love it,

19:25.707 --> 19:28.418
but I think we--can we talk
about this for a second?

19:28.460 --> 19:31.671
- Look at this view.
Look at this killer view.

- It's amazing, right?
- Yeah.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.805
I--[exhales]

19:40.847 --> 19:43.933
- Gonna have the best summer
of our lives here.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.518
Do you like it?

19:45.560 --> 19:47.145
- This is beautiful, babe,
but, like,

19:47.187 --> 19:50.315
what--what are--
what are we doing?

19:50.357 --> 19:51.608
- What do you mean
what are we doing?

19:51.649 --> 19:53.360
We're--it's our dream house.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.528
That's what we're doing.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.697
- We have been struggling
big time.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.491
I think you know that, right?

19:59.532 --> 20:02.660
And a marriage can only stretch
so far before it breaks,

20:02.702 --> 20:04.537
and I don't want us to break.

20:04.579 --> 20:05.914
- Don't worry.
We're not gonna break.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.208
No one's breaking here.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.584
- I think this whole
fucking situation

20:09.626 --> 20:11.878
has put way more pressure on us

20:11.920 --> 20:13.213
than we actually thought
it would, so I--

20:13.254 --> 20:14.589
- Yes. Yeah.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.383
The world is coming at us.
That's what it does.

20:16.424 --> 20:20.303
It tests you.
It tempts you.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.721
- What does that mean?

20:21.763 --> 20:25.266
- It means that we gotta
stay tight.

20:26.810 --> 20:29.020
That's why I got us the house.
Oh.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.731
- Okay.
Babe, it's not about the house.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.566
The house is amazing,
but it's not about the house.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.194
It's about us.
I want us to be happy.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.570
We haven't been connecting
at all.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.531
We were fighting about
everything--the burner,

20:39.572 --> 20:41.741
Ruby, the dog--
doesn't that bother you at all?

20:41.783 --> 20:44.577
- What bothers me is that
I just made our dreams come true

20:44.619 --> 20:45.829
and, for whatever reason,

20:45.870 --> 20:47.455
you wanna focus
on busting my balls.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.790
That's what's bothering me.
- Oh, my--

20:48.832 --> 20:50.208
why do you have to do this?
- It's never enough.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.584
- That's not true.
- It is true.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.211
It's been true for 12 years.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.754
- Don't "12 years" me!

20:54.796 --> 20:56.548
- Yeah, you're so busy
comparing us

20:56.589 --> 20:58.591
to all your rich friends--
the house is too small.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.552
The yard's too small.
The car sucks.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.720
- Is that the kind of person
you think I am?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.179
You think I am that shallow?

21:03.221 --> 21:05.098
- Does it really matter
I didn't make the top ten?

21:05.140 --> 21:06.307
- Oh, my God.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.642
- I'm sorry I didn't make
Federer money.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.602
Does it really matter?
I'm still the same person.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.771
Let me ask you--
I'm just curious.

21:11.813 --> 21:14.524
Where's the cutoff
to stop loving somebody?

21:14.566 --> 21:16.526
Is it a top ten? The top 20?
What is it?

21:16.568 --> 21:18.278
- I have never cared
about the money.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.113
I care that you gave up!

21:20.155 --> 21:21.489
- I gave up on tennis?

21:21.531 --> 21:22.574
Are you serious?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.325
I tore my fucking ACL!

21:24.367 --> 21:27.412
- You gave up on life!

21:27.454 --> 21:29.080
You gave up on us!

21:30.999 --> 21:33.418
- Where are you going?

21:33.460 --> 21:34.627
You're leaving?
- Yep.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.463
Doesn't feel good, does it?

21:36.504 --> 21:38.465
- Come on.
Don't do that. Please.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.967
[thud]
- Oh, my Go--ahh!

21:41.009 --> 21:42.177
Oh!

21:42.218 --> 21:45.221
[both scream]

21:45.263 --> 21:48.183
[gentle piano music]

21:48.224 --> 21:55.357
* *

22:52.706 --> 22:54.749
kids: Nice shot, Dad.
