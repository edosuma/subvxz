00:01.935 --> 00:04.412
Hey, Gina!
We got an anonymous gift basket.

00:04.413 --> 00:05.493
Yeah, it's full of treats.

00:05.494 --> 00:07.324
It's got meats, cheeses,
candies,

00:07.325 --> 00:08.334
all the food groups.

00:08.335 --> 00:09.415
The cheese is amazing.

00:09.416 --> 00:12.286
It melts in my mouth
and in my hands.

00:12.287 --> 00:15.052
Hmm, French chocolates,
French cheeses,

00:15.053 --> 00:16.338
tiny French pickles.

00:16.340 --> 00:18.510
Did none of you detectives
think this might be a gift

00:18.511 --> 00:22.372
for Captain Holt from
someone in France?

00:22.373 --> 00:24.638
Like his husband,
<i>par exemple?</i>

00:24.639 --> 00:27.355
What? [laughs]
No way.

00:27.356 --> 00:30.507
This is a nice present from
an unknown, appreciative citizen

00:30.508 --> 00:32.328
that wanted us to munch.

00:32.329 --> 00:34.309
Hmm, what's this, then?

00:34.310 --> 00:36.701
"Dear Captain Raymond Holt,
thinking of you.

00:36.702 --> 00:40.322
Best, Dr. Kevin Cozner, Ph.D."

00:40.323 --> 00:42.353
He even used their pet names.

00:42.354 --> 00:44.987
Oh, no, I ate the
chocolate-covered strawberry.

00:44.988 --> 00:46.703
That's the most intimate
snack of them all.

00:46.704 --> 00:48.367
Holt's gonna be back from
his meeting in 30 minutes.

00:48.368 --> 00:49.862
- What do we do?
- Eat the note!

00:49.863 --> 00:52.339
No!
No.

00:52.340 --> 00:54.761
It's okay.
We can fix this.

00:56.529 --> 00:57.716
Check it out, sir.

00:57.717 --> 01:02.375
A lovely gift basket that Kevin
sent you all the way from Paris.

01:02.376 --> 01:04.126
Straight from Paris!

01:08.519 --> 01:11.727
Stapler, scissors.

01:13.522 --> 01:15.473
Rubber bands.

01:18.525 --> 01:21.039
That man really knows me.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.599

Attention, squad.
I just received a call.

01:45.584 --> 01:48.525
A very important,
very high profile celebrity

01:48.526 --> 01:49.908
was robbed in our precinct.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.617
What celebrity, sir?
Is it a Chris?

01:51.618 --> 01:55.459
Hemsworth? Evans? Pratt? Pine?
Brown? Cross?

01:55.460 --> 01:56.570
[gasps]
Is it a non-Chris?

01:56.571 --> 01:59.601
This is a sensitive matter,
and I can only disclose details

01:59.602 --> 02:01.522
to the lead detective
on the case.

02:01.523 --> 02:03.553
Sergeant, let me know
who's available, ASAP.

02:03.554 --> 02:04.594
Yes, sir.

02:04.595 --> 02:06.665
Sarge, Sarge, Sarge.

02:06.666 --> 02:08.878
You know
that I'm your guy for this.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.458
You can't give
a celebrity case to Amy.

02:11.459 --> 02:14.580
The last movie she saw was
a documentary about spelling bees.

02:14.581 --> 02:17.531
Wrong; it was about
the font Helvetica,

02:17.532 --> 02:19.200
and it played like
an action thriller.

02:19.201 --> 02:21.504
You already have
a case, Peralta.

02:21.505 --> 02:22.902
I assigned it to you
this morning.

02:22.903 --> 02:25.088
That was just some kid with
a little bit of pot on him.

02:25.089 --> 02:27.527
Meanwhile, Chris Rock
is tied up in his basement

02:27.528 --> 02:29.658
calling out for my help,
and you're standing in my way.

02:29.659 --> 02:31.649
Just work the case
I assigned you.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.601
Can't I just give my case
to Hitchcock and Scully?

02:33.602 --> 02:35.622
I mean, they clearly have
a ton of time on their hands.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.485
Hitchcock hasn't even gotten
out of his chair today.

02:37.486 --> 02:40.625
Hey, Jake, I can go
anywhere in this thing.

02:40.626 --> 02:43.231
But... shouldn't.

02:43.232 --> 02:45.567
Hitchcock and Scully
are house mouses.

02:45.568 --> 02:47.568
They do paperwork
and they're good at it.

02:47.569 --> 02:49.281
They don't go out
in the field.

02:49.282 --> 02:51.897
Boyle, you take
the celebrity case.

02:52.322 --> 02:54.890
Me? Instead of Jake?

02:54.891 --> 02:57.664
Have you lost your damn mind?
I am so sorry, Jake.

02:57.665 --> 02:59.127
I don't know what's
wrong with Terry.

02:59.128 --> 03:01.261
Don't worry.
I'm gonna work it with you.

03:01.262 --> 03:03.688
I'm giving my drug bust
to Hitchcock and Scully.

03:03.689 --> 03:06.659
It's time to get these mice
out of their hice.

03:06.660 --> 03:08.600
Oh, that was lame.
Life is meaningless.

03:08.601 --> 03:10.091
We're all gonna die.

03:10.092 --> 03:12.623
Mouses out of their houses.
Yes, I am the greatest.

03:12.624 --> 03:14.674
Every breath is a gift.
Sorry about the roller coaster.

03:14.675 --> 03:17.058
I'm just happy
I'm tall enough to ride.

03:17.727 --> 03:18.792
Hey, Rosa.

03:18.793 --> 03:20.557
Saw you hadn't signed up
for the blood drive yet,

03:20.558 --> 03:22.022
so I brought you the sheet.

03:22.023 --> 03:25.945
Sorry, can't.
I'm... under 17 years old.

03:25.946 --> 03:28.722
Wait, you didn't sign up
last year, either.

03:28.723 --> 03:31.603
Or the year before.

03:31.604 --> 03:32.684
Are you afraid of needles?

03:32.685 --> 03:34.545
I don't like being
stabbed by someone

03:34.546 --> 03:35.616
so they can steal my blood.

03:35.617 --> 03:37.156
I'm crazy.

03:37.157 --> 03:40.124
This is amazing; you're
scared of something I'm not.

03:40.125 --> 03:42.447
I'm tougher than you.
I'm tougher than Rosa.

03:42.448 --> 03:44.701
Eh, I take it back.
I'm so sorry.

03:44.702 --> 03:47.693
Look, it's okay.
We all have fears.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.564
I'm so claustrophobic,
I can't even go

03:49.565 --> 03:51.635
into the downstairs
supply closet.

03:51.636 --> 03:53.626
I hear they have some
hot new binder clips,

03:53.627 --> 03:55.707
but I'll never know.

03:55.708 --> 03:57.288
I'm scared of businessmen.

03:57.289 --> 04:01.540
A whole army of gray-suited
Brads and Chads trying

04:01.541 --> 04:05.723
to suck my soul and redeem it
for frequent flyer miles.

04:05.724 --> 04:07.077
Great, so you guys get it.

04:07.078 --> 04:09.039
- Conversation over, bye.
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.201
What if we each agree to face
one of our fears today

04:13.202 --> 04:16.363
for ourselves
and for all of womenkind?

04:16.363 --> 04:18.166
Ugh.
That sounds terrible.

04:18.168 --> 04:20.197
But I'm in.

04:20.947 --> 04:22.489
Fine, I'll do it too.

04:22.490 --> 04:24.272
Guys, come on.

04:24.273 --> 04:26.755
I really think this'll
be good for... oh, wait.

04:26.756 --> 04:29.351
You... we're doing my thing?
Okay.

04:29.842 --> 04:31.498
<i>Thanks for taking us
to lunch, Jake.</i>

04:31.499 --> 04:33.330
Of course.
Get whatever you want.

04:33.331 --> 04:35.477
Oh, man, I already ate.

04:35.478 --> 04:37.455
I guess I'll just have
a cheeseburger deluxe,

04:37.456 --> 04:39.712
couple slices of pie,
maybe an egg cream.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.653
- Okay.
- And a waffle.

04:41.654 --> 04:44.615
So look, a big, important
drug case came across my desk,

04:44.616 --> 04:45.564
and I need your help.

04:45.565 --> 04:48.687
Only problem is, Sarge doesn't
think you can handle it.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.708
- He's right.
- No, he's not.

04:50.709 --> 04:52.230
Look, you're
Hitchcock and Scully.

04:52.231 --> 04:53.418
You guys are legends.

04:53.419 --> 04:56.236
You single-handedly caught
the Prospect Park Flasher.

04:56.237 --> 04:58.068
Well, he was being
chased by other cops,

04:58.069 --> 04:59.744
but he did slip
on my spilled chili.

04:59.745 --> 05:02.675
And who bumped into Scully,
causing the spill? Me.

05:02.676 --> 05:05.687
Damn right, and who fell
asleep under their desks

05:05.688 --> 05:07.355
and caught the janitor
stealing evidence?

05:07.356 --> 05:08.161
We did.

05:08.162 --> 05:09.689
And who sued the department

05:09.690 --> 05:12.681
and got triple-ply toilet paper
in every precinct?

05:12.682 --> 05:13.681
We did.

05:13.682 --> 05:14.702
Terry thinks you guys

05:14.703 --> 05:15.753
are too old and too lazy
to handle this,

05:15.754 --> 05:17.594
but I know what
you're really made of.

05:17.595 --> 05:19.362
You're gonna take this case
and prove him wrong!

05:19.363 --> 05:21.272
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

05:21.273 --> 05:23.285
We're still gonna
eat lunch, right?

05:23.286 --> 05:25.788
Obviously, a high profile
celebrity case such as this one

05:25.789 --> 05:28.288
needs to be handled
with the utmost discretion.

05:28.908 --> 05:30.916
I promise
I'll be professional,

05:30.917 --> 05:32.502
even if it's Dianne Wiest.

05:32.503 --> 05:35.804
Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm
gonna meet Dianne Wiest!

05:35.805 --> 05:37.775
She's so sexual!

05:37.776 --> 05:40.882
No, our victim...

05:40.883 --> 05:44.321
is John... William...

05:45.771 --> 05:47.682
Weichselbraun.

05:48.732 --> 05:50.474
Remind me who that is again?

05:50.475 --> 05:53.189
You're kidding.
He's a world-renowned oboist,

05:53.190 --> 05:55.349
first chair with the New York
Symphony Orchestra.

05:55.350 --> 05:58.797
Kevin and I are huge fans
of Weichselbraun's work.

05:58.798 --> 06:02.769
We are what the Internet
sometimes refers to as...

06:02.770 --> 06:04.740
Weichselbraun fans.

06:04.741 --> 06:05.763
Not Weichselbrauniacs?

06:05.764 --> 06:07.775
Oh, that's very good.

06:07.776 --> 06:09.393
I'm gonna use that liberally.

06:09.394 --> 06:12.064
Anyway, Weichselbraun's
$40,000 oboe

06:12.065 --> 06:13.297
was stolen from his apartment,

06:13.298 --> 06:15.052
and you need to find it.

06:15.053 --> 06:16.777
I'd work the case myself

06:16.778 --> 06:18.938
if it didn't smack
of preferential treatment.

06:18.939 --> 06:21.002
Don't worry, sir.
I can handle this.

06:21.003 --> 06:23.811
So you do think it smacks
of preferential treatment?

06:23.812 --> 06:25.832
I don't know what
you want me to say.

06:25.833 --> 06:28.685
Okay, you've convinced me.
I'll work the case with you.

06:30.138 --> 06:31.691
Great.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.144
I think you owe me
an apology.

06:34.145 --> 06:36.299
I'll apologize
to you in hell.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.139
I actually don't know
what this is about.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.468
Sorry I took
such a hard stance.

06:39.469 --> 06:42.842
Holt's celebrity was
just some lame oboist.

06:42.843 --> 06:46.794
Meanwhile, we just linked
your little dumb pot bust

06:46.795 --> 06:48.825
to a major narcotics ring.

06:48.826 --> 06:51.039
This might be the biggest drug
case

06:51.040 --> 06:52.988
the Nine-Nine's had in years.

06:52.989 --> 06:54.464
Cool.

06:54.465 --> 06:56.820
Uh-oh.

06:56.821 --> 06:58.622
I know a real "cool"
when I hear one.

06:58.623 --> 07:01.543
That wasn't a real "cool."
What did you do?

07:02.407 --> 07:05.745
Well...

07:05.746 --> 07:08.757
I may have given
that very huge drug case

07:08.758 --> 07:10.199
to Hitchcock and Scully.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.659
- What?
- In my defense,

07:12.660 --> 07:15.871
I was pretty sure you were
never gonna find out.

07:15.896 --> 07:17.894
I don't know where
Hitchcock and Scully are.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.068
They're not answering
their phones,

07:19.069 --> 07:21.876
and they signed our dealer...
the one link to our drug ring...

07:21.877 --> 07:22.997
out of holding.

07:22.998 --> 07:25.919
I swear, if they mess up
this case, Jake, it's on you.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.300
They're detectives.

07:27.301 --> 07:28.870
They've been on the force
for 500 years.

07:28.871 --> 07:30.140
They know what they're doing.

07:30.141 --> 07:32.993
The only item on Scully's
calendar for the entire year

07:32.994 --> 07:34.804
is "eat peanut butter."

07:34.805 --> 07:35.924
Yeah, we got to find them.

07:35.925 --> 07:38.220
And to do that, we have
to think like they do.

07:39.601 --> 07:41.343
I'm going in.

07:42.076 --> 07:46.000
All right, there's
the butt indentation,

07:46.001 --> 07:47.021
and...

07:47.022 --> 07:48.021
[grunts]

07:48.022 --> 07:49.022
I'm docked.

07:49.023 --> 07:51.212
Ugh.
Still warm.

07:51.213 --> 07:54.915
All right, residual cushion fart
is about a six out of ten.

07:54.916 --> 07:56.699
He's been gone an hour,
maybe two.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.118
- But where?
- Hot dogs.

07:58.119 --> 07:59.948
- They went for hot dogs.
- How do you know?

07:59.949 --> 08:02.940
There's a water stain on
the ceiling in the shape of a bun.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.246
Let's go.

08:05.992 --> 08:08.299
Excuse me, have you
seen Hitchcock and Scully?

08:08.300 --> 08:09.984
Three times a day
for 12 years.

08:09.985 --> 08:12.865
Twice as often since I started
serving sweet wieners.

08:12.866 --> 08:13.906
Sweet wieners?

08:13.907 --> 08:15.827
It's a normal hot dog
with a little chocolate sauce.

08:15.828 --> 08:16.998
- One please!
- No, Jake.

08:16.999 --> 08:19.476
- No, Terry.
- Have you seen them recently?

08:19.477 --> 08:21.849
Half hour ago... they ate, and
then they took off in a hurry.

08:21.850 --> 08:23.336
[sighs]
Half an hour.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.638
They could be anywhere by now.
Nope, there's Scully.

08:26.924 --> 08:27.984
Where's Hitchcock?

08:27.985 --> 08:29.845
I'm taking you guys
off your drug case.

08:29.846 --> 08:30.885
Of course you are.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.431
Jake said you didn't
believe in us.

08:32.432 --> 08:34.918
What? He didn't
believe in you either.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.682
He was just pumping you up with
lies so you'd work his case.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.256
Jake, is this true?

08:39.258 --> 08:41.071
I just thought, you know,

08:41.072 --> 08:43.445
the two of you might
be better off

08:43.446 --> 08:45.187
mousing around the old house.

08:45.188 --> 08:46.844
Oh, I get it.

08:46.845 --> 08:49.710
Just because I got my finger
stuck in a glue trap once,

08:49.711 --> 08:51.017
I'm a mouse?

08:51.018 --> 08:52.848
I got the cheese out,
by the way.

08:52.849 --> 08:54.454
- Oh, my God.
- Look, man,

08:54.455 --> 08:56.060
we need to know
where Hitchcock is.

08:56.061 --> 08:58.070
I am ordering you
to tell us everything.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.042
Fine.
We're setting up a sting.

09:00.043 --> 09:02.514
I'm going undercover
as Tex Dallas,

09:02.515 --> 09:04.865
billionaire oil man
from Dallas, Texas,

09:04.866 --> 09:06.561
with ties
to the cowboy mafia.

09:06.562 --> 09:08.716
- Oh, boy.
- Hitchcock's my middle man,

09:08.717 --> 09:11.899
Reno Vegas,
mobster from Reno, Las Vegas.

09:11.900 --> 09:12.989
I said my "oh, boy" too soon.

09:12.990 --> 09:15.901
In 20 minutes, he's going in
totally alone, unarmed,

09:15.902 --> 09:17.912
without a cell phone,
to meet with one of their guys

09:17.913 --> 09:18.983
to set up a buy.

09:18.984 --> 09:20.874
So how do you like
our plan now?

09:20.875 --> 09:23.439
It's a disaster, man!
We got to stop it!

09:23.440 --> 09:25.867
Disaster? Tell me
one thing that's wrong

09:25.868 --> 09:26.947
with Operation Beans.

09:26.948 --> 09:29.065
Operation Beans?

09:30.413 --> 09:32.901
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm Detective Charles Boyle...

09:32.902 --> 09:34.439
From the Nine-Nine.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.852
My precinct.
I'm the captain, Raymond Holt.

09:37.924 --> 09:40.015
Okay.
Uh, please, come on in.

09:40.016 --> 09:42.693
I'll show you the back room
where they broke in.

09:42.694 --> 09:45.058
You're an incredibly gracious host,
Mr. Weichselbraun.

09:45.059 --> 09:47.909
Wow, that pronunciation
is flawless.

09:47.910 --> 09:49.920
[laughs]

09:49.921 --> 09:53.883
I must admit, I'm a bit
of a Weichselbrauniac.

09:53.884 --> 09:57.905
Hmm, I saw you perform Bach's
"Oboe Sonata in G Minor"

09:57.906 --> 09:59.210
at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music.

09:59.211 --> 10:00.603
I was in the front row.

10:00.604 --> 10:03.142
You were escorted out
for gasping too loudly.

10:03.143 --> 10:04.098
Ah.

10:04.099 --> 10:06.319
This is a pretty
modest apartment.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.922
How did you afford a $40,000
oboe in the first place?

10:09.923 --> 10:11.527
I admit that there's
not as much money

10:11.528 --> 10:13.147
in classical music
as there once was...

10:13.148 --> 10:16.015
Which is the real crime here.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.916
Boyle, can I
talk to you privately?

10:17.917 --> 10:18.967
Sure.

10:18.968 --> 10:20.908
What are you doing?
You just insulted

10:20.909 --> 10:22.971
our celebrity victim
to his face.

10:22.972 --> 10:24.930
You keep saying "celebrity,"
but he's drying his socks

10:24.931 --> 10:26.921
on a George Foreman grill.

10:26.922 --> 10:29.002
This is John William
Weichselbraun,

10:29.003 --> 10:32.014
the Silver Spit Prince.

10:32.015 --> 10:34.547
I'm making myself primary
detective on this case.

10:34.548 --> 10:35.605
You can wait in the car.

10:35.606 --> 10:37.928
Oh, but first, take a picture
of the two of us together.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.019
Make sure we're laughing.

10:40.896 --> 10:42.130
Ha-ha!

10:42.131 --> 10:43.971
[chuckles]

10:43.972 --> 10:45.102
Ah.

10:45.103 --> 10:50.064
Okay, so, I'm going to face
my fear of confined spaces.

10:50.065 --> 10:52.956
When I'm ready,
you will shut the trunk

10:52.957 --> 10:55.238
and leave me here
for 30 minutes.

10:55.239 --> 10:57.672
I left a juice box
and a diaper in there for you,

10:57.673 --> 10:59.009
so you're gonna be fine.

10:59.010 --> 11:00.941
Or we could all
give in to our fears

11:00.942 --> 11:02.952
and keep our blood in
our bodies like normal people.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.983
No, Rosa, we are doing
something important here.

11:05.984 --> 11:08.945
We are women, standing up
and supporting each other

11:08.946 --> 11:10.146
and becoming...

11:10.147 --> 11:12.047
New fear: listening
to Amy inspire us.

11:12.048 --> 11:15.119
Be back in a half hour, Ames.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.010
Wait! Come back!

11:18.011 --> 11:19.951
Come back, I can't do this!

11:19.952 --> 11:22.014
- No, <i>you're</i> the best!
- [laughs]

11:26.671 --> 11:28.231
You did it.
How'd it go?

11:28.232 --> 11:32.812
Well, the first ten minutes
were really terrible.

11:32.813 --> 11:35.170
The diaper did not fit.
It was for a baby.

11:35.171 --> 11:40.093
But then I relaxed,
and I found my inner strength.

11:40.094 --> 11:42.767
I think the lesson here is that,
as women, we...

11:42.768 --> 11:43.756
No, no, no, no!

11:43.757 --> 11:45.539
You close that trunk again
and I will kill you!

11:45.540 --> 11:47.375
You hear me?
I will kill you!

11:49.924 --> 11:51.980
We're almost there.
Slow down, Pinto.

11:51.981 --> 11:53.050
I didn't agree to a bean name.

11:53.051 --> 11:55.345
We are not doing
Operation Beans.

11:55.346 --> 11:57.559
You know, the only reason
Hitchcock and I took this case

11:57.560 --> 11:59.107
is because you said
we were great.

11:59.108 --> 12:00.995
I'm beginning to think
you were lying to us.

12:00.996 --> 12:03.510
I was lying!
I already admitted that.

12:03.511 --> 12:06.048
Well, if anything happens,
it's because of you.

12:06.049 --> 12:07.629
- Right, Mung?
- Right.

12:07.630 --> 12:09.149
If Hitchcock dies,
it's 'cause of Pinto.

12:09.150 --> 12:10.595
Terry, I know
that you're mad,

12:10.596 --> 12:12.673
but you don't have
to jump on the bean train.

12:12.674 --> 12:14.073
Uh-oh.

12:16.074 --> 12:19.186
Chickpea!
No!

12:20.513 --> 12:21.622
Looks like they're
taking Hitchcock

12:21.623 --> 12:23.742
inside that building, and it
looks like they're armed.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.793
Dammit, Jake!

12:24.794 --> 12:26.894
You couldn't just do
the case I assigned you?

12:26.895 --> 12:29.676
Hitchcock's life is in danger.
He has a wife, man.

12:29.677 --> 12:30.867
Don't worry.
If anything happens to him,

12:30.868 --> 12:32.698
she'll be taken care of.

12:32.699 --> 12:35.408
If I die, I want you
to marry Lucille.

12:35.975 --> 12:38.123
I can't stand the thought
of you being alone.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.552
Deal. Let's make it
a blood pact.

12:40.553 --> 12:43.684
Oh, look,
I'm already bleeding.

12:43.685 --> 12:45.512
So just normal friend stuff.

12:45.513 --> 12:48.104
- So what's the plan?
- We stick with Operation Beans.

12:48.105 --> 12:50.698
We knock on the front door.
I say I'm Tex Dallas.

12:50.699 --> 12:52.906
You're my buddy, Alamo,
and you're Black Fred.

12:52.907 --> 12:55.368
Black Fred?
Why Black Fred?

12:55.369 --> 12:56.701
There's no other Fred!

12:56.702 --> 12:58.165
Yeah, but they don't
know that.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.455
I say Terry and I go in

12:59.456 --> 13:00.881
through the roof
and do some recon.

13:00.882 --> 13:03.175
Scully, you stay here and call
for backup in case we need it.

13:03.176 --> 13:04.195
Oh, no way.

13:04.196 --> 13:06.135
That's my partner in there.
I'm going in.

13:06.136 --> 13:08.877
Also, I can't call for help.
I don't have any quarters.

13:09.810 --> 13:11.755
Hard to argue
with that logic.

13:12.934 --> 13:14.078
- You know I...
- Sir, I need to talk to you

13:14.079 --> 13:16.261
about the Weichselbraun case.

13:16.704 --> 13:19.547
Oh, I didn't realize you
were here, Mr. Weichselbraun.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.669
I was in the area,
and the captain is a fan,

13:21.670 --> 13:24.445
so I came by to give him
a little gift, as a thank you.

13:24.446 --> 13:27.051
It's a signed copy
of his book of mouth exercises.

13:27.052 --> 13:30.152
"Reed It and Weep."
"Reed" with two Es?

13:30.153 --> 13:31.811
It's my favorite joke
of all time.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.732
- I'll come back later.
- Oh, nonsense.

13:33.733 --> 13:36.744
I'm sure John...
he insists I call him "John"...

13:36.745 --> 13:38.443
I'm sure John would
appreciate an update

13:38.444 --> 13:40.914
on the whereabouts of his oboe,
wouldn't you, John?

13:40.915 --> 13:42.282
- Yeah.
- Well said, John.

13:42.283 --> 13:44.083
- Did you hear what John said?
- I did,

13:44.084 --> 13:45.580
but it's an open
investigation,

13:45.581 --> 13:47.413
and I don't think it's proper
to share information

13:47.414 --> 13:48.731
with the parties involved.

13:48.732 --> 13:50.101
Well, that's why you're
no longer the primary.

13:50.102 --> 13:52.713
John played oboe for
Lynne Cheney.

13:52.714 --> 13:54.788
I'm sure we can
trust him to be discreet.

13:54.789 --> 13:56.735
- Out with it.
- Okay, well,

13:56.736 --> 13:58.026
John, you're under arrest.

13:58.027 --> 13:59.213
- What?
- Excuse me?

13:59.214 --> 14:01.512
He staged the robbery
for the insurance money

14:01.513 --> 14:04.588
because he's broke, because
oboists are not celebrities.

14:04.589 --> 14:06.266
This is ludicrous, Boyle.

14:06.267 --> 14:08.541
Do you have one iota
of evidence?

14:08.542 --> 14:10.801
I found the oboe
for sale online.

14:10.802 --> 14:14.011
We traced the IP address back to
Mr. Weichselbraun's computer.

14:16.402 --> 14:18.649
Oh, John.

14:19.176 --> 14:21.598
Okay, Sarge, everyone
knows you're a superhero,

14:21.599 --> 14:23.987
so you lower Scully and I
into that skylight

14:23.988 --> 14:25.094
and then fly down to meet us.

14:25.095 --> 14:26.719
- You know that's impossible.
- Fine.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.422
We'll lower Scully
down together,

14:28.423 --> 14:30.543
and then flop onto him
like a giant mattress.

14:30.544 --> 14:32.604
No, you go first,
then I lower Scully,

14:32.605 --> 14:35.908
and you...
you get to catch him.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.936
Great.
I love that plan.

14:39.478 --> 14:40.589
[quietly]
Come on.

14:40.590 --> 14:42.628
Whoa!
[both grunting]

14:42.629 --> 14:44.598
I got him.

14:49.912 --> 14:52.117
- Look what I found.
- French fries?

14:52.118 --> 14:54.268
What?
No, it's Hitchcock.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.886
Where would I have found
French fries in a weed farm?

14:58.596 --> 15:01.221
Oh, man, look at him.
This is bad.

15:01.222 --> 15:03.101
He hates standing up.

15:03.780 --> 15:05.790
To conquer my fear
of businessmen,

15:05.791 --> 15:07.459
I must walk among them.

15:07.460 --> 15:09.729
I will shake
their clammy hands

15:09.730 --> 15:12.784
and listen to them talk
about things like

15:12.785 --> 15:15.045
how hard Wednesdays can be.

15:15.974 --> 15:19.008
Does this outfit look
drab and lifeless enough?

15:19.009 --> 15:21.623
Also, thanks, Amy,
for letting me borrow it.

15:21.624 --> 15:24.841
You're welcome.
I wore that suit to prom.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.525
Student chaperone.

15:26.897 --> 15:28.924
I guess this
is really happening.

15:28.925 --> 15:30.102
[inhales]

15:33.694 --> 15:35.958
How about those
quarterly write-offs?

15:35.959 --> 15:38.502
And did you hear
about the merger?

15:38.503 --> 15:41.605
Also, we all need to go in
on those flowers for Beth.

15:41.606 --> 15:43.639
Aw, Wednesdays.

15:43.640 --> 15:44.684
Who are you again?

15:44.685 --> 15:48.125
Gina, from Sales.
I have the plant on my desk.

15:48.126 --> 15:51.218
Oh, yeah.
You want to sit with us.

15:51.673 --> 15:53.335
We'll all be dead so soon.

15:53.336 --> 15:54.858
What?

15:54.859 --> 15:56.262
I would love to sit.

15:58.780 --> 16:00.972
Ugh.

16:00.973 --> 16:03.943
That was a nightmare.
I ate a Caesar salad wrap.

16:03.944 --> 16:06.845
I'm so proud of you,
you lioness.

16:06.846 --> 16:07.896
You faced your fear.

16:07.897 --> 16:10.689
And I emerged victorious.

16:10.690 --> 16:13.819
Yay!

16:13.820 --> 16:14.820
[sighs]

16:14.821 --> 16:15.820
That was a wig?

16:16.151 --> 16:19.701
You didn't think I'd put
my actual hair in a ponytail?

16:19.702 --> 16:20.833
Are you insane?

16:20.834 --> 16:22.154
Oh, there's the boss.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.877
I ask only one time.
Who do you work for?

16:27.878 --> 16:30.859
DEA? FBI? Police?

16:30.860 --> 16:32.840
I'm in the cowboy mafia.

16:32.841 --> 16:34.653
I work for the Dallas
Buyers Club.

16:34.654 --> 16:36.842
- I came up with that name.
- No, you didn't.

16:36.843 --> 16:38.873
It's a movie about AIDS.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.055
You're lying.
Let's try again.

16:41.056 --> 16:42.976
- FBI?
- Oof!

16:42.977 --> 16:44.066
- DEA?
- [grunts]

16:44.067 --> 16:45.937
- Police?
- Aah!

16:45.938 --> 16:47.838
Oh no, he's not gonna last.

16:47.839 --> 16:49.019
Oh, Jake, you got
to do something.

16:49.020 --> 16:51.035
I don't want to
marry Hitchcock's wife.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.912
Here we come, Chickpea.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.994
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Easy!

16:56.995 --> 16:58.228
Howdy there!

16:58.229 --> 17:00.015
I'd really appreciate it
kindly

17:00.016 --> 17:03.317
if y'all would stop punching
my associate Reno, there.

17:03.318 --> 17:05.999
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Alamo.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.040
This here's Tex,
and this is...

17:08.040 --> 17:09.931
Fred.
Just Fred.

17:09.932 --> 17:13.022
And we are...

17:13.023 --> 17:14.924
the Dallas Buyers Club.

17:14.925 --> 17:17.055
Okay.
We make a deal.

17:17.056 --> 17:18.086
[speaks Serbian]

17:18.087 --> 17:19.916
[chuckles]
Sounds good.

17:19.917 --> 17:21.490
No, I just told them
to surround you.

17:21.491 --> 17:23.029
Dagnabbit.
Oof!

17:24.972 --> 17:27.252
Look, Sarge, I'm sorry
that we're in this mess,

17:27.252 --> 17:28.482
but on the bright side,

17:28.483 --> 17:30.493
we don't have to deal
with some lame oboist.

17:30.494 --> 17:32.614
You should be apologizing
to Hitchcock and Scully.

17:32.615 --> 17:35.436
You took them out of their
house mouse comfort zone,

17:35.437 --> 17:36.758
and now they might get killed.

17:36.759 --> 17:38.827
You really think
they're going to kill us?

17:38.828 --> 17:41.298
Oh, no, now I'm starting
to panic sweat.

17:41.299 --> 17:42.738
Starting to?

17:42.739 --> 17:44.391
What have you been doing
for the past hour?

17:44.392 --> 17:46.185
- Normal sweating.
- Wait a minute.

17:46.186 --> 17:50.374
If you get killed,
what happens to all your debt?

17:50.375 --> 17:53.337
Loophole!

17:54.468 --> 17:57.488
Oh, you sweaty,
chair-spinning morons.

17:57.489 --> 17:59.360
You're gonna get us
out of here.

18:00.381 --> 18:02.291
Boyle, may I speak to you?

18:02.962 --> 18:03.963
I don't know.

18:03.964 --> 18:06.152
Are you still mad
that I arrested John?

18:06.153 --> 18:07.322
No.

18:08.562 --> 18:11.536
I know he's guilty.
I'm just chagrined.

18:11.537 --> 18:13.349
Deeply chagrined.

18:13.350 --> 18:16.829
I finally understand the old
adage, "Never meet your heroes."

18:16.830 --> 18:20.216
This is just like when I found
out Robert Frost was from...

18:21.067 --> 18:22.337
California.

18:22.338 --> 18:24.434
Or when I saw Mario Batali
with his hair down.

18:24.435 --> 18:26.335
[shudders]

18:26.336 --> 18:28.777
Well, you've handled this case
with the utmost professionalism,

18:28.778 --> 18:31.291
while I've behaved crassly.

18:31.796 --> 18:33.836
I think I've figured out
a way to make it up to you.

18:34.229 --> 18:37.110
Oh, my God,
is Dianne Wiest here?

18:37.111 --> 18:40.067
No, I've hired a trio
of classical musicians

18:40.068 --> 18:42.534
to perform
a Shostakovich cantata,

18:42.535 --> 18:46.981
originally written as
an apology to a dear friend.

18:49.579 --> 18:51.559
Are you stealing
kitchen supplies?

18:51.560 --> 18:53.021
Just let us have this stuff.

18:53.022 --> 18:54.872
You have so much,
and we have so little.

18:55.399 --> 18:58.347
Perhaps I'll just
buy you a drink instead.

18:58.348 --> 19:00.554
Yeah, that would be best.

19:00.555 --> 19:03.217
Classical musicians
are savages.

19:03.795 --> 19:05.567
They're not gonna
kill you fast, Scully.

19:05.568 --> 19:07.488
They're gonna
make it real slow.

19:07.489 --> 19:08.549
First they're gonna scalp you,

19:08.550 --> 19:10.480
and then they're gonna
rip your tongue out!

19:10.481 --> 19:13.361
No.
That's my cupcake taster!

19:13.362 --> 19:14.562
What are you doing?
Lay off him!

19:14.563 --> 19:17.826
Never! For my plan to work,
he's gotta be basting in sweat.

19:17.827 --> 19:20.735
Hitchcock, you once told me you
could roll that chair anywhere.

19:20.736 --> 19:22.126
Think you could take it
up those stairs?

19:22.127 --> 19:24.398
I once rode a chair home
in a blizzard.

19:24.399 --> 19:26.685
So, yeah, I can go up stairs.

19:26.686 --> 19:28.164
So do it.

19:32.353 --> 19:33.416
Oh, he's amazing.

19:33.417 --> 19:36.130
He's like a big, lazy
Michelle Kwan.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.756
But how's he gonna get
up the stairs?

19:38.644 --> 19:40.959
Jake!
He already did.

19:43.431 --> 19:45.319
Okay, it's go time.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.854
Help!
My man's having a heart attack!

19:47.855 --> 19:49.083
Help!

19:50.176 --> 19:51.523
Hitchcock, now!

19:51.524 --> 19:53.524
[grunts]

19:53.525 --> 19:54.728
Scully!
Grab his gun.

19:56.517 --> 19:59.715
[roars]

19:59.716 --> 20:02.317
It's not sticky
because I'm so juicy!

20:02.318 --> 20:03.798
Told you I knew
what I was doing.

20:03.799 --> 20:05.173
Black Fred, think quick.

20:05.174 --> 20:07.522
No, no, ow!
That was a gun, man!

20:07.523 --> 20:09.881
Scully, grab that dude's knife
and cut us loose.

20:09.882 --> 20:11.628
We're gonna get the rest
of these guys.

20:11.629 --> 20:15.943
It's time for Operation Beans,
phase two, the refrying.

20:16.356 --> 20:17.811
Sure you're ready to go
through with this?

20:17.812 --> 20:20.396
You know what?
Today was stupid.

20:20.397 --> 20:22.723
But seeing you both overcome
your fears did help me,

20:22.724 --> 20:25.613
and I think we've
all grown as women.

20:27.973 --> 20:28.799
Okay.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.575
I'm ready.

20:30.576 --> 20:32.340
Stab me! Stab me!

20:32.341 --> 20:33.794
Do it, just do it!

20:33.795 --> 20:35.719
- Rosa?
- I'm psyching myself up.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.439
[yells]

20:38.440 --> 20:40.350
Don't look at them!
Look at me!

20:40.351 --> 20:42.338
Do your job!
Drain me!

20:43.293 --> 20:44.484
<i>[elevator bell dings]</i>

20:45.787 --> 20:47.057
There they are!

20:47.058 --> 20:49.586
Everybody give it up
for Hitchcock and Scully.

20:49.587 --> 20:51.328
[applause]

20:51.329 --> 20:53.428
To thank you for all you did,

20:53.429 --> 20:55.488
bringing down a drug ring,

20:55.489 --> 20:57.057
we have a little present
for you:

20:57.058 --> 21:00.196
brand-new, top-of-the-line
desk chairs,

21:00.197 --> 21:03.316
extra padding, with adjustable
height and recline.

21:03.317 --> 21:05.054
Hey, chair!

21:05.055 --> 21:07.064
Get ready to meet
your new best friend:

21:07.065 --> 21:09.914
my ass.

21:09.915 --> 21:11.924
[both groaning happily]

21:11.925 --> 21:13.004
That was very nice of you.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.064
They did good.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.874
Also, I was worried
they might want

21:15.875 --> 21:17.144
to go out in the field more,

21:17.145 --> 21:19.346
and I need something to
keep them at their desks.

21:19.347 --> 21:21.904
You really think that that
is going to keep them at their...

21:21.905 --> 21:23.401
and they're both
asleep already.

21:23.402 --> 21:25.034
And the city's safer for it.

21:25.035 --> 21:27.289
Sleep tight,
you magnificent oafs.

21:27.290 --> 21:28.813
You deserve it.
