01:38.100 --> 01:43.030
<i>Is it really wise for Shockwave
to spawn an army of beasts</i>

01:43.030 --> 01:48.540
here in this laboratory, or
within any part of this warship?

01:48.540 --> 01:51.810
I mean, not even the lone
beast we had was compact enough

01:51.810 --> 01:56.780
to stroll these corridors
without tearing them asunder.

01:56.780 --> 02:01.620
Which reminds me, I am so
very sorry for your loss.

02:02.850 --> 02:06.460
I was referring to
my offsite laboratory,

02:06.460 --> 02:09.830
which we have erected expressly
for the cloning procedures.

02:12.460 --> 02:15.160
You think of everything, don't you?

02:17.070 --> 02:19.840
We are under attack.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.710
- Autobots?
- Illogical.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.540
Though there appears
to be an enormous mass

02:28.550 --> 02:30.650
upon the upper hull.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.590
How did it find us?

02:43.600 --> 02:46.900
Predacons possess
precise homing instincts.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.700
And astonishing resilience.

02:49.700 --> 02:53.600
Starscream,
assume command of my beast.

02:53.610 --> 02:57.440
Me, master?
I mean, I wouldn't dream

02:57.440 --> 03:01.010
of seizing such an honor
from its very creator.

03:01.010 --> 03:04.250
Military command of the
Predacon is most logical,

03:04.250 --> 03:06.850
since my services are
required elsewhere.

03:30.780 --> 03:34.010
<i>All right, Beast Hunters.
According to our intel,</i>

03:34.010 --> 03:36.110
the Decepticons should be excavating

03:36.110 --> 03:39.180
for Predacon bones directly beneath us.

03:39.180 --> 03:40.650
On it, chief.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.860
Does Wheeljack not comprehend
the chain of command?

03:46.860 --> 03:49.760
I didn't authorize him to
advance without proper cover.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.760
I'm sure Jackie's just
trying to prove himself

03:52.760 --> 03:55.800
now that you and he are
serving together again, sir.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.930
<i>Yee-ha!</i>

04:08.950 --> 04:11.680
<i>Jackie, wait up.
Ultra Magnus wants us to...</i>

04:11.680 --> 04:15.050
- Blah, blah, blah.
- Shh! Shh!

04:31.600 --> 04:36.110
- Wrecker fact number 17?
- "Guards never look up."

05:08.710 --> 05:10.270
Scrap.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.890
That's why we wait for cover.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.230
Ah, bolts.

06:08.970 --> 06:10.700
Uh...

06:13.000 --> 06:14.470
Forgot you were in there, kid.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.040
At least I didn't heave
on any floormats this time.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.480
<i>You miserable beast.
I am your commanding officer,</i>

06:27.490 --> 06:32.120
and I order you to crawl
into your kennel now!

06:35.330 --> 06:36.990
I said go, already!

06:54.040 --> 06:57.380
And what could have possibly
compelled you to bring the native?

07:02.220 --> 07:06.390
Yo.
Can I come with?

07:06.390 --> 07:08.190
Why not?

07:10.030 --> 07:12.190
Are your circuits impaired, soldier?

07:12.200 --> 07:15.200
Prime told you to lead
the Wreckers on this one.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.530
I assumed he meant all of 'em.

07:17.540 --> 07:20.300
<i>Are you mocking
your commanding officer?</i>

07:20.300 --> 07:22.910
Wouldn't think of it, sir.

07:22.910 --> 07:26.880
The kid's a full-blown Wrecker.
Ain't that right, Bulkhead?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.380
Well...

07:28.380 --> 07:31.250
Look. She may be small,
but she saved my tailpipe.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.120
Snuffed an Insecticon all on her own.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.220
Outside standard protocol, no doubt.

07:37.220 --> 07:43.960
- The point is, I can handle myself, sir.
- Miko has been through worse,

07:43.960 --> 07:46.960
and we've drawn out the
enemy and cleared passage.

07:55.340 --> 07:58.570
Okay, now in you go.

08:01.210 --> 08:05.480
Do your worst.
The Apex armor is virtually...

08:07.440 --> 08:09.840
<i>No!
Release me!</i>

08:18.200 --> 08:21.830
<i>Starscream, are you with the beast?</i>

08:21.830 --> 08:26.100
Yes, master. We've been
reviewing attack maneuvers.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.500
He's doing quite well.

08:28.510 --> 08:32.210
<i>One of the excavation teams
has failed to report in.</i>

08:32.210 --> 08:35.409
I shall assemble my seeker
armada immediately and...

08:35.409 --> 08:40.250
<i>I would prefer that you lead our
newly-returned asset on this mission,</i>

08:40.250 --> 08:43.590
so that we may see if
our Predacon is as adept

08:43.590 --> 08:47.460
at fetching bones as
it is hunting Autobots.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.200
Is this it?

09:00.370 --> 09:02.340
No. That's a rock.

09:05.410 --> 09:08.380
Heh.
Just like old times, huh, Jackie?

09:08.380 --> 09:12.880
Except back then, I didn't need
permission to pick my partners.

09:12.880 --> 09:17.420
Come on, we're all on the same team.
Hey, Beast Hunters, right?

09:17.420 --> 09:20.620
During all those cycles it
took me to travel to Earth,

09:20.620 --> 09:24.590
all I could think about was getting
our band of brothers back together.

09:24.590 --> 09:27.330
But this isn't the lineup I had in mind.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.970
You did the smart thing, Bulk,
leaving the Wreckers when you did.

09:32.970 --> 09:37.270
While we were still bringing our
A-game, before the rust set in.

09:37.270 --> 09:41.440
Wait, I thought Wheeljack was
the one who left the Wreckers.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.240
Jackie basically deserted

09:43.250 --> 09:46.310
once the Wreckers fell
under Ultra Magnus' command.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.250
I transferred out before that,
to join up with Optimus

09:49.250 --> 09:51.920
in the battle of Thunderhead Pass.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.260
Sometimes I think Jackie
feels like I deserted him.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.060
You don't wanna be the one
who breaks up the band, Bulk.

10:04.130 --> 10:05.400
What was that?

10:10.570 --> 10:13.240
Whatever it is, it's big.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.480
And it's coming fast.

10:25.490 --> 10:28.660
The Predacon.
Let's roll.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.560
It's back?

11:04.530 --> 11:06.130
<i>Accelerate!</i>

11:16.140 --> 11:18.070
That rock won't hold it forever.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.440
We need to contact base
and request reinforcements.

11:21.510 --> 11:24.180
Wreckers don't call for backup.

11:27.380 --> 11:29.150
What Jackie means is,

11:29.150 --> 11:32.250
we can't get a comm-link
signal this far underground.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.700
Miko, I have to get you out of here.
Gonna need you to climb.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.730
- No way. I wanna help.
- And you will.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.670
Your mission: Reach my ship so
you can contact Optimus Prime.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.370
Yes, sir.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.420
Not sure I like the sound of that.

12:08.390 --> 12:11.360
- So, uh...
- We make our stand...

12:12.330 --> 12:14.060
here and now.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.650
<i>Given that this
ship is currently unoccupied,</i>

12:31.650 --> 12:34.680
it would seem the
Autobots did stumble upon

12:34.680 --> 12:38.290
our little mining operation.
No worries.

12:38.290 --> 12:43.490
My Predacon is no doubt dismantling
the interlopers as we speak.

12:43.490 --> 12:48.160
It was a challenge, but I managed
to tame the savage beast.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.300
Taught it to heed my every command.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.430
Come on, come on.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.470
<i>You're not wearing the
armor to protect yourself from it?</i>

12:57.470 --> 13:00.410
From my beloved pet?
Of course not.

13:00.410 --> 13:03.540
In fact, it's getting
rather warm in here.

13:11.890 --> 13:14.160
Ah, ventilation.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.880
Open fire!

13:44.350 --> 13:45.620
<i>Whoa!</i>

14:04.510 --> 14:05.840
No, you don't.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.240
Whoa!

14:16.190 --> 14:17.820
<i>Hey, hot-head!</i>

14:38.740 --> 14:40.440
Oh, scrap.

14:55.590 --> 14:58.330
Ooh, that'll do some damage.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.530
Miko, is it?

15:47.480 --> 15:51.310
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you
trying to reach this ship?

15:51.310 --> 15:53.850
To call for help, perhaps?

16:23.740 --> 16:25.350
Whoa!

16:27.950 --> 16:29.820
What's the matter, 'Screamy?

16:29.820 --> 16:32.550
Can't pick on someone your own size?

16:43.660 --> 16:46.930
What do you know, it does fetch.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.110
Scrap.

17:07.619 --> 17:10.890
Well, that didn't go exacty as planned.

17:10.890 --> 17:13.560
That's because any
first-cycle Cadet knows better

17:13.560 --> 17:16.599
than to detonate a grenade
in a confined space.

17:16.599 --> 17:20.970
Even if I intended the "confined space"
to be the belly of the beast?

17:22.069 --> 17:25.290
- Uh, sir...
- Your actions continue to

17:25.290 --> 17:28.840
be just one step removed
from getting us all scrapped.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.680
With all due respect, sir,

17:30.680 --> 17:34.210
the Predacon's loose and
Miko's out there alone.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.990
Permission to provide cover, sir?

17:43.990 --> 17:46.560
Go ahead, make a wreck of her,

17:46.560 --> 17:49.600
as you no doubt did the Wreckers.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.900
<i>Starscream, status report.</i>

17:52.870 --> 17:54.570
Master.

17:54.570 --> 17:57.100
We have secured the bone,
and our Predacon is dealing

17:57.110 --> 18:00.470
with the Autobots'
pet human as we speak.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.610
On my command, of course.

18:02.610 --> 18:06.980
<i>I will not risk losing a precious
commodity to your arrogance.</i>

18:09.180 --> 18:11.180
I'll tear you apart!

18:14.020 --> 18:17.120
<i>Have the beast return
with my prize, immediately!</i>

18:17.130 --> 18:21.190
<i>You can stay behind
and finish the Autobots.</i>

18:21.200 --> 18:22.830
Yes, master.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.470
Assuming I can coerce the
brainless brute into...

18:40.250 --> 18:42.980
But... you never obey my commands!

18:45.190 --> 18:48.790
You heard our Master.
We must locate the Autobots.

18:48.790 --> 18:52.090
As soon as I retrieve
what belongs to me.

18:56.660 --> 18:57.960
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

18:57.970 --> 19:02.770
Even the strongest armor can't
protect the weakest of creatures.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.140
Protected you, didn't it?

20:04.700 --> 20:06.230
<i>Who's wrecking who now?</i>

20:12.040 --> 20:14.940
Miko?

20:14.940 --> 20:18.210
Perhaps you weren't wrong
about the human after all.

20:23.830 --> 20:28.140
You do know that I vanquished
Cliffjumper, don't you?

20:28.140 --> 20:30.540
<i>Big whoop.</i>

20:30.540 --> 20:33.480
I snuffed Hardshell.

20:40.180 --> 20:42.120
Ah! Retreat.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.120
Aw.

20:50.992 --> 20:52.800
They got away with the bone.

20:52.800 --> 20:57.670
Hey, you brought your A-game,
kid, like a true Wrecker.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.780
And I wanna remember
us just like this...

21:11.750 --> 21:14.180
before the rust sets in.

21:19.590 --> 21:21.660
What?
Where's Wheeljack going?

21:22.730 --> 21:25.530
- Solo.
- Again?

21:25.530 --> 21:28.260
Jackie just broke up the band.
