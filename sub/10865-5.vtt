00:30.040 --> 00:32.119
Tucker, don't move.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.880
Uh-oh.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.000
I can't believe
you blew me off.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.880
What's with the paint,
Picasso?

00:41.880 --> 00:43.520
Tucker was
supposed to help me

00:43.520 --> 00:44.600
paint the den,

00:44.600 --> 00:45.760
but he never
showed.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.080
I didn't finish
till 10 minutes ago.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.440
I'm sorry.
I got hung up.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.440
I'll hang you up
by your feet, you little--

00:52.440 --> 00:55.160
Easy, boys, easy.
Save it for home.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.640
I hate it when
I step in water.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.760
Who says I stepped
in water?

01:04.760 --> 01:06.160
Euw.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.520
Yes, absolutely.
I can't wait.

01:13.520 --> 01:14.720
Huh?

01:14.720 --> 01:15.920
What happened to you?

01:15.920 --> 01:17.040
Shh.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.360
He'll tell you later.
I want to start.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.640
Want to wipe up?

01:28.960 --> 01:30.040
Thanks.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.840
My story's
kind of fitting.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.480
It's about 2 brothers
that don't get along

01:40.480 --> 01:42.000
for a lot of reasons,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.600
but mostly because they're
so different from each other.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.280
Is tonight nonfiction night?

01:47.280 --> 01:48.520
And it's about trust.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.880
It's about knowing that
when you're in trouble

01:50.880 --> 01:52.880
and your back's
to the wall,

01:52.880 --> 01:55.840
you got to have somebody
to rely on.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.280
And it may be
the one person

01:59.280 --> 02:00.840
that you least expect.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.040
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:06.040 --> 02:08.720
I call this story...

02:23.040 --> 02:26.200
[Clanking]

02:39.160 --> 02:40.000
[Alarm]

02:42.200 --> 02:43.960
The power.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.360
Code blue, code blue.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.800
We have a break.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.880
Lockdown on block 5.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.120
They're out!

02:55.640 --> 02:57.080
[Screaming]

03:01.440 --> 03:03.360
And that's how
it all began.

03:03.360 --> 03:08.360
October 19, 1922--
the great prison revolt.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.640
We'll now have
a 10-minute break

03:10.640 --> 03:13.880
so you can go and visit
the souvenir stand,

03:13.880 --> 03:15.240
and then we'll take you
to the devil's den,

03:15.240 --> 03:17.400
where the murderers
were housed.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.480
Tucker: Jason and Scott
were complete opposites.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.760
Jason was president
of the chess club--

03:36.760 --> 03:39.640
small, smart
and kind of a loner.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.800
Scott was a jock--
big, tough, and popular.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.800
They never had anything
to do with each other,

03:46.800 --> 03:49.720
until Jason's mother
married Scott's father.

03:49.720 --> 03:50.920
Big trouble.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.400
Well, I like the
designs on this one,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.920
but the colors on this
one are really cool,

03:55.920 --> 03:57.640
and this one's
really neat.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.400
So?

03:59.120 --> 04:02.040
Um, that one.
No, not that one.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.760
This one's better,
but, uh,

04:03.760 --> 04:05.360
this one's funnier.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.840
Excuse me. He'll
take that one,

04:06.840 --> 04:08.360
I'll take this one.
Thank you.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.160
But I didn't--

04:10.160 --> 04:12.080
That'll be $10.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.040
Hey, you owe me 5 bucks.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.840
Get lost.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.360
Listen, jock itch,
you stole half my room

04:25.360 --> 04:27.360
and I'm not going
to let you

04:27.360 --> 04:29.000
steal half
my money, too.

04:30.120 --> 04:33.480
Well, I only
have a $10 bill.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.160
Now, you're welcome
to come and get it,

04:36.160 --> 04:37.840
if you like.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.920
I didn't think so.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.800
P.A.: Visitors,
please line up at--

04:45.800 --> 04:49.280
tour's starting again.
This way, everyone.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.600
Hey.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.560
Cover for me. I'll
crunch that little weasel.

05:33.880 --> 05:34.800
Boo.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.760
Gotcha.

05:36.760 --> 05:37.920
You wish.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.560
I saw it.
You jumped.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.760
I scared the great
tough one.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.000
I'm just gonna
leave you down here.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.880
Wait up.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.800
Whoa.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.200
It's another dummy, dummy.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.640
I've been called
a lot of names,

06:09.640 --> 06:12.840
but dummy ain't
one of them.

06:12.840 --> 06:17.840
Most call me One-Eyed Jack.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.440
Why are you in there?
Are you an actor?

06:20.440 --> 06:21.160
Actor?

06:22.840 --> 06:24.800
[Chuckling]

06:24.800 --> 06:27.800
I made one mistake
in life--

06:27.800 --> 06:28.800
robbed a bank.

06:28.800 --> 06:33.760
But I done my time,
and more.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.480
Wow. That's cute.
You sell t-shirts, too?

06:37.480 --> 06:39.280
You...

06:40.720 --> 06:41.840
Come here.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.920
Open the door.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.920
Huh?

06:44.920 --> 06:47.920
Pull the lever--
right there.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.080
This one?

06:49.080 --> 06:50.400
Yeah. Pull it.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.280
Well, maybe
we shouldn't,

06:52.280 --> 06:55.280
but maybe it's part
of the show.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.080
Would you
give me a break.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.800
Oh, freedom, freedom.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.600
[Laughing]

07:17.920 --> 07:20.200
Man, that was awesome.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.160
Let's get out
of here.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.960
Go in the cell.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.440
Hey, how did you
do that?

07:26.440 --> 07:27.600
Go in.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.320
No, thanks.
I'm outta here.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.640
I said go
in the cell.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.200
On the count of 3,
follow me.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.240
One, 2--

07:37.240 --> 07:37.720
3.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.400
Come back.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.520
[Panting]

07:46.520 --> 07:48.640
Tell me that
wasn't weird.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.240
[Screaming]

07:57.320 --> 07:58.640
Where have you 2 been?

07:58.640 --> 08:01.200
Mr. Clarence,
there's a guy--

08:01.200 --> 08:02.840
like a ghost--
he had a patch--

08:02.840 --> 08:07.080
The bus is leaving now,
with or without you.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.920
Maybe we should
call the police,

08:25.920 --> 08:28.720
or, maybe the prison
officials, or the newspapers.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.560
Yeah. No, they'll think
we're crazy.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.559
Let me see. The police.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.760
But the prison people
should know.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.840
Enough, OK?

08:37.840 --> 08:39.039
You're driving
me nuts.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.120
Well, we should think
about the options.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.159
You only have 2 options.

08:44.159 --> 08:48.400
One, you shut up.
2, I shut you up.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.520
Choose.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.800
All right. Are you
saying we should

08:51.800 --> 08:53.760
just forget about
what we saw?

08:53.760 --> 08:56.840
I'll tell you
what we saw.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.840
We saw
some new exhibit,

08:58.840 --> 09:00.560
a movie, a hologram,
something.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.680
You think?

09:01.680 --> 09:04.600
What do you think
it was, a ghost?

09:04.600 --> 09:07.120
Yeah, that is
kind of dumb, huh?

09:07.120 --> 09:08.240
[Chuckling]

09:08.240 --> 09:11.440
You know what else
is really dumb?

09:11.440 --> 09:13.440
No. What?

09:13.440 --> 09:17.080
Never ever
take money from me.

09:20.240 --> 09:20.960
Ow.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.280
[Swoosh]

10:23.000 --> 10:25.520
Scott, did you
hear that noise?

10:27.120 --> 10:28.200
Scott?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.000
[Clattering]

10:30.000 --> 10:31.520
Scott?

10:34.240 --> 10:35.800
Stop fooling around.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.040
I know you're in there.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.280
What are you doing?

10:42.280 --> 10:44.320
Just getting some water.
What are you doing?

10:44.320 --> 10:45.960
Well, I heard a noise.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.040
I thought it might be--

10:48.040 --> 10:49.720
Did you open the window?

10:49.720 --> 10:50.920
No.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.640
You know I can't sleep
with the wind blowing in.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.480
I'll wake up
with a cold.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.360
Come back.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.240
Please come back.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.000
You must come back.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.400
What is it?
Are you all right?

11:13.400 --> 11:15.440
It was a ghost--
outside the window.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.440
Take a look.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.320
OK, our class
was at

11:20.320 --> 11:21.760
the penitentiary
place today.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.280
And we found
this guy in a cell

11:23.280 --> 11:24.760
and we let him out.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.360
It had to be a ghost.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.360
Guys, that prison
freaked me out

11:28.360 --> 11:30.760
when I was a kid, too.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.880
No, it really
happened.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.800
There's no ghosts
out here,

11:35.800 --> 11:38.120
unless they can fly up
a couple stories.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.640
Ha! See, that's exactly
what it did.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.280
Aren't you guys
a little old

11:43.280 --> 11:45.120
to still believe
in the bogeyman?

11:45.120 --> 11:46.520
No, no, but--

11:46.520 --> 11:49.320
Good night, boys.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.960
I didn't know the
bogeyman had an age limit.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.640
Nobody's gonna
believe us.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.240
Why did
it come here?

11:59.240 --> 12:00.880
<i>Why is it after us?</i>

12:00.880 --> 12:02.000
I don't know.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.560
Maybe it wants us
to take its place

12:04.560 --> 12:05.560
for all eternity.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.320
Yeah, well...

12:07.320 --> 12:08.640
I know one thing.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.960
And that's that I'm
not going anywhere

12:10.960 --> 12:11.960
without a fight.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.600
If that thing
comes back,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.960
are you with me, or are
you going to wuss out?

12:15.960 --> 12:17.680
I'm no wuss.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.400
Yeah, we'll see.
You got first watch.

12:25.720 --> 12:29.280
April, May-- got it.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.360
June 1, 1942.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.560
"One-Eyed Jack,
a convict doing time

12:32.560 --> 12:34.880

12:39.720 --> 12:41.280
August 29, 1945.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.720
The week the prison
closed.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.520
That's right.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.520
They never found him.

OK, listen to this. "Elma Briggs,

13:09.440 --> 13:12.240
It says here that she
lives on linden place.

13:12.240 --> 13:15.080
That's on
the West Side, right?

13:15.080 --> 13:16.760
Yeah, so?

13:16.760 --> 13:17.760
Maybe we should--

13:17.760 --> 13:19.640
[footsteps]

13:19.640 --> 13:21.120
What was that?

13:21.120 --> 13:22.160
It's him!

13:22.160 --> 13:23.800
Hey, where are
you going?

13:23.800 --> 13:26.520
Go away.
Leave us alone.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.080
I'm not afraid
of you.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.440
Well, you'd better be,

13:32.440 --> 13:35.120
because if you 2
don't keep it down,

13:35.120 --> 13:38.480
I'm going to throw
your butts out of here.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.240
I didn't wimp out,

13:46.240 --> 13:49.080
I just thought maybe
we should retreat.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.440
Well, just
stop thinking.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.160
Ow!

13:54.680 --> 13:55.680
Ring the bell.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.640
No, you ring it.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.400
What do you want?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.200
Uh, just to talk
to you, ma'am.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.400
About what?

14:08.400 --> 14:09.400
One-Eyed Jack.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.040
Is he your father?

14:11.040 --> 14:14.480
Why can't you let me
live in peace?

14:14.480 --> 14:16.600
Where's the patch
over your eye, boy?

14:16.600 --> 14:19.720
Didn't you bring it with
you, like all the others?

14:19.720 --> 14:21.680
Don't you want
a good laugh?

14:21.680 --> 14:23.560
Jeez, lady, chill.

14:23.560 --> 14:28.720
Get off my property,
and don't come back.

14:28.720 --> 14:32.880
You hear me? Don't
you ever come back.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.360
I wish Mom was here.

14:39.360 --> 14:42.640
Why, so you could tell
her how you wussed out?

14:42.640 --> 14:44.800
Would you get off
my back?

15:07.480 --> 15:09.400
I'm sick of taking
your flack.

15:09.400 --> 15:13.960
So why don't you do something
about it then, wuss boy?

15:17.760 --> 15:19.040
Or can't you decide?

15:19.040 --> 15:20.640
Maybe I should punch him,

15:20.640 --> 15:22.240
but maybe
I'll hurt myself.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.840
Maybe I should
tell mommy,

15:23.840 --> 15:25.120
but, then again--

15:25.120 --> 15:26.840
Stop! Get off
my case.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.960
That did it.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.680
I am going to hit
you so hard

15:31.680 --> 15:33.800
that your mama's
gonna feel it.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.280
Scott!

15:45.000 --> 15:45.720
Scott?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.440
Scott?

15:52.800 --> 15:54.720
Oh, no one's
gonna believe me.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.920
But I got to do something.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.840
[Clank]

17:28.720 --> 17:30.320
Scott?

17:30.320 --> 17:32.520
Scott? You all right?

17:32.520 --> 17:35.040
Scott, it's me.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.720
Jeez.

17:41.480 --> 17:42.400
Where are we?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.760
We're in the prison.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.760
One-Eyed Jack
brought you here.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.880
What are we doing?
Let's bolt.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.040
What do you want?

17:51.040 --> 17:53.040
We didn't
do anything to you.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.680
Why did he
bring us here?

17:54.680 --> 17:56.680
I don't know.
What if he--

17:56.680 --> 17:58.640
Hold on a second.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.240
He brought me here.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.960
How did you get here?

18:03.960 --> 18:05.600
I came to rescue you.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.480
Guess I didn't
do so hot.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.800
You're trying
to save me.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.400
Yeah.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.800
Why?

18:16.800 --> 18:19.800
I don't know. Maybe to
prove I'm not a wimp.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.640
What?
Ugh!

18:27.640 --> 18:31.040
I just saw the biggest,
fattest rat I have ever seen.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.280
Where'd it go?

18:32.280 --> 18:34.240
I don't know.
Some hole--

18:34.240 --> 18:35.240
A hole?

18:36.800 --> 18:38.880
What are you doing?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.880
Well, this is the cell that
One-Eyed Jack escaped from--

18:41.880 --> 18:43.600
How did he get out?

18:43.600 --> 18:45.440
A tunnel.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.280
I'll bet it's behind
the toilet.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.800
It's coming--pull.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.600
Looks like
a ventilation shaft.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.600
Want me to go first?

19:10.600 --> 19:11.920
Yeah.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.200
I don't think so.
Get going.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.360
We're losing head-room.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.600
You OK?

19:23.600 --> 19:24.960
Yeah.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.360
Ooh. Oh, man,
I lost the flashlight.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.480
Hey, why are
you stopping?

19:44.480 --> 19:45.960
I'm freaking in here.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.000
There's something
blocking the way.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.200
Hold on. I got
the flashlight.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.720
All right. We need
some light.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.040
[Screaming]

20:06.080 --> 20:08.120
Oh, no, it's Jack!

20:11.560 --> 20:14.000
Oh, my--ugh.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.560
That is so nasty.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.680
One-Eyed Jack: 50 years

20:20.680 --> 20:22.600
I've been stuck
in that shaft.

20:22.600 --> 20:26.200
Look, pal, why can't you just
leave me and my brother alone?

20:26.200 --> 20:29.920
Such a good job
of covering my tracks.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.720
Everyone thought I escaped.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.880
That was you?

20:36.880 --> 20:39.920
Not a pretty way to go.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.440
No one heard me.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.920
No one even knew
I was there--

20:46.080 --> 20:47.800
till now.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.160
Sorry for putting you
through all that, boys.

20:51.160 --> 20:55.800
Um, that's no problem.
We're just going to go now.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.960
Wait.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.280
Could you do me
a favor first?

21:00.280 --> 21:04.600
Could you tell my daughter
what happened to me?

21:04.600 --> 21:08.800
She's paid a heavy price all
these years, not knowing.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.960
Um...

21:09.960 --> 21:12.160
I don't think
she's gonna believe us.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.440
Look in my pocket--

21:14.440 --> 21:17.600
you'll find something
that'll help.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.600
Thank you, boys.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.000
Thank you.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.360
<i>Tucker:
After all those years,</i>

21:45.360 --> 21:46.760
<i> One-Eyed Jack's daughter</i>

21:46.760 --> 21:49.160
<i> finally found out what
happened to her father,</i>

21:49.160 --> 21:51.880
<i> and she, too,
found some peace.</i>

21:51.880 --> 21:55.480
Thank you, boys.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.000
Thank you.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.000
So, uh, what do you
want to do now?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.680
Well, we could go
the arcade,

22:06.680 --> 22:08.400
and then get
some lunch.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.680
Sounds good.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.240
Or, we could get
lunch first,

22:11.240 --> 22:12.320
and then go
to the arcade.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.800
Sorry, no. Arcade,
then lunch.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.880
Or, you know,
on the other hand,

22:17.880 --> 22:20.920
maybe we could just
go to the arcade...

22:20.920 --> 22:23.360
Here's the 5 bucks
I owe you,

22:23.360 --> 22:25.560
but don't push it,
all right?

22:32.760 --> 22:34.680
And Jason and Scott
found that

22:34.680 --> 22:37.520
in spite of
their differences...

22:37.520 --> 22:39.240
They really were brothers.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.760
Cool.
Wow.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.200
How sweet.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.000
Saturday night-- I can't wait.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.200
What is going on Saturday?

22:53.440 --> 22:54.560
We gotta talk.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.000
You must have
a death wish.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.960
I didn't
help you today

22:58.960 --> 23:00.840
'cause I got
stuck in line

23:00.840 --> 23:02.160
waiting to buy tickets.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.720
Tickets to what?

23:05.720 --> 23:07.720
Happy birthday.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.880
Lollapalooza tickets?

23:10.880 --> 23:12.800
These aren't possible
to get.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.480
And I told Sam you
wanted to take her.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.480
I knew
you'd be too chicken.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.960
I... you... but...

23:22.680 --> 23:25.280
Tucker? Sometimes I
want to wring your neck,

23:25.280 --> 23:28.920
but other times, I wonder
what I'd do without you.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.520
Thanks.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.560
You're welcome.
