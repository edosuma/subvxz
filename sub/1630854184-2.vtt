00:16.566 --> 00:19.936
So, Mr. du Lac.
How long have you been dead?

00:20.036 --> 00:21.705
I'm saying you'd do it
for 10%.

00:21.805 --> 00:23.640
10% for all the work?

00:23.740 --> 00:24.941
These men look
down on you.

00:25.041 --> 00:26.176
Do you not
know your value?

00:26.276 --> 00:28.345
He wouldn't tell me
how he did it.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.181
Don't do that here!
Not with my family.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.017
I loved my brother
more than anyone on Earth.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.852
Paul! Paul!

00:35.952 --> 00:38.021
Paul's in Hell
because of you.

00:38.122 --> 00:39.223
Help me, please!

00:39.323 --> 00:41.191
I laid down
with the devil.

00:48.031 --> 00:57.241
*

00:57.474 --> 01:07.184
*

01:21.498 --> 01:23.500
It's Venetian.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.136
A contemporary
of Tintoretto's.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.575
"Marius de Romanus."

01:31.675 --> 01:32.909
Never heard of him.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.611
Little of his work survives.

01:34.711 --> 01:37.314
Mr. de Pointe du Lac
covets the rare.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.550
Do you hear that?

01:40.650 --> 01:42.719
[Creaking in distance]

01:42.819 --> 01:44.721
I keep hearing that sound.

01:44.821 --> 01:46.590
Well, the building
sways a bit,

01:46.690 --> 01:49.393
but that is according
to its design, given the height.

01:49.493 --> 01:51.895
We call it the groan.

01:51.995 --> 01:54.531
It won't disturb your meal,
which is ready now.

01:54.631 --> 01:55.799
Did you always work
for him?

01:55.899 --> 01:57.133
Please have a seat.

01:57.234 --> 01:58.402
Sign an NDA?

01:58.502 --> 02:00.770
I mean, is it only work
or are you and he...?

02:00.870 --> 02:04.241
I serve a god.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.643
It is my honor to serve.

02:06.743 --> 02:10.447
Mr. de Pointe du Lac
will join you at course seven.

02:10.547 --> 02:15.084
Seven? Wait, but how many
courses are there?

02:15.185 --> 02:17.754
Fattening me up
for the inevitable end?

02:17.854 --> 02:25.061
*

02:25.161 --> 02:27.397
Butler #1: Duck foie gras
terrine, pickled fruit,

02:27.497 --> 02:29.098
roasted apple bonbon.

02:29.199 --> 02:35.805

02:57.927 --> 03:04.934
*

03:05.034 --> 03:07.036
There he is.

03:07.136 --> 03:09.839
You missed at least three
or four endangered species.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.642
I want to apologize
for my outburst earlier.

03:12.742 --> 03:15.512
I can assure you,
it will not happen again.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.314
Memory is a monster.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.949
We forget, it doesn't.

03:20.049 --> 03:25.989
Uh, this is session two,
Louis de Pointe du Lac.

03:26.089 --> 03:28.525
Eh, can we turn down
the music?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.360
[Volume decreases]
Butler #1: Ajoblanco.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.697
Bread, crushed almonds, garlic,
olive oil, and salt,

03:33.797 --> 03:35.231
a garnish of green grapes,

03:35.332 --> 03:39.336
and AB negative,
fresh from the farm.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.638
Bon appétit.

03:41.738 --> 03:43.373
Part of me wants to ask
about the farm.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.375
Two vampires walk
into a church.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.176
That's where we left off.

03:47.277 --> 03:50.079
Blissing out
post-priesticide.

03:50.179 --> 03:51.681
[Groaning]

03:51.781 --> 03:55.985
Louis: The bliss was merely
a stage in my transformation --

03:56.085 --> 03:59.856
pain followed, a seizing
and unrelenting pain,

03:59.956 --> 04:03.026
through which I would pass
before my apprenticeship began.

04:03.126 --> 04:04.494
What's happening?

04:04.594 --> 04:05.929
Lestat:
Your body is confused.

04:06.029 --> 04:07.897
Your lungs feel like water,
your heart, fire.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.400
You feel as if you're dying,

04:10.500 --> 04:11.901
because you are.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.504
[Groaning]

04:14.604 --> 04:15.705
[Retches]

04:15.805 --> 04:18.007
And then,
there's the retching.

04:18.107 --> 04:19.676
I recognize the hypocrite
I am,

04:19.776 --> 04:22.612
emphasizing cleanliness
after I overindulged,

04:22.712 --> 04:27.116
but a proper disposal is
the penance of a sated vampire.

04:27.216 --> 04:30.253
And you won't always have
a conveniently located graveyard

04:30.354 --> 04:32.556
nearby, so...
[Breathing heavily]

04:32.656 --> 04:33.790
Nuh-uh-uh-uh.

04:33.890 --> 04:34.924
Nuh-uh-uh.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.060
We live off the blood
of the living.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.362
Lap up the blood
of the deceased

04:38.462 --> 04:40.063
and it'll suck you
right down into death,

04:40.163 --> 04:41.731
along with your victim.

04:41.831 --> 04:44.601
Hmm?

04:44.701 --> 04:50.039

05:43.092 --> 05:46.863
Louis: Lestat's blood was
giggling inside me,

05:46.963 --> 05:49.833
teasing my senses,
illuminating the district

05:49.933 --> 05:52.502
with overwhelming detail,

05:52.602 --> 05:55.772
as if I had walked
my entire life as a dead man,

05:55.872 --> 05:58.642
and now, dead,
could finally receive

05:58.742 --> 06:01.344
the secrets of existence.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.346
Daniel:
You were fucking loaded.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.048
Beyond articulation.

[Dog chews]

06:14.458 --> 06:18.161
Follow my voice,
a single strain.

led by your hunger.

Are you hungry, Louis?

06:24.434 --> 06:26.703
Uh-huh.
[Chuckles]

06:26.803 --> 06:28.404
They were your brothers
and sisters once,

06:28.505 --> 06:31.240
but now they're
your savory inferiors.

06:31.340 --> 06:34.210
A young Tempranillo,
fleshy and tart.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.712
[Indistinct conversation]

06:35.812 --> 06:39.849
A Primitivo, hints of iron,
rather plain otherwise.

06:39.949 --> 06:41.685
[Indistinct conversation]

06:41.785 --> 06:47.056

* Way haul away

06:49.292 --> 06:50.727
* We'll haul away, Joe
Hunting is an art.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.730
You have the power to subdue
anyone you want,

06:53.830 --> 06:57.400
but sometimes restraint
is your most powerful weapon.

[Chuckles] Straight
to the prettiest girl

07:11.214 --> 07:12.415
at the party.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.117
I admire the aesthetic,

07:14.217 --> 07:15.519
but you'll spend
most of your evening

07:15.619 --> 07:17.086
trying to separate him
from his crew.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.421
You'll race the sun
to the kill,

07:18.522 --> 07:20.123
and when he turns up
missing in the morning,

07:20.223 --> 07:23.593
you'll have half the frigate
on the prowl, looking for him.

07:23.693 --> 07:30.900
In the beginning, it's best
to let the food come to you.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.235
Here you go.

07:32.335 --> 07:34.538
I was a baby bird
in Lestat's nest --

07:34.638 --> 07:38.341
not yet ready to hunt,
but desperate to feed.

07:39.743 --> 07:42.211
[Slurps]
So, I'm taking my daughter

07:42.311 --> 07:44.147
to -- to look at horses,
uh, Palominos.

07:44.247 --> 07:46.115
You know, those --
those Indian types that --

07:46.215 --> 07:49.452
that they run free out West,
and, uh, I gotta tell you,

07:49.553 --> 07:51.888
I'm, uh, I'm doing pretty good
for myself, you know?

07:51.988 --> 07:53.156
It's a new century,

07:53.256 --> 07:56.459
new job, so I'm actually
entertaining the thought

07:56.560 --> 07:57.727
of getting her one of these,

07:57.827 --> 07:59.128
you know, a special horse.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.496
We go down to the fairground.

08:00.597 --> 08:04.233
She says, "Daddy, why is
that horse walking so funny?

08:04.333 --> 08:07.637
Why is his -- his back
all crumpled up like that?"

08:07.737 --> 08:10.974
Well, I tell her, I say,
"Honey, once the work has gotten

08:11.074 --> 08:12.475
used all up out of a horse..."
[Heart beating]

08:12.576 --> 08:13.910
"...this is what happens --"

08:14.010 --> 08:16.112
Amusing, their relentless
questions at that age.

08:16.212 --> 08:17.280
That's right.

08:17.380 --> 08:18.648
I tell her, "This is
the nature of things.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.483
[Heart beating]
[Echoing] Someone has to

08:20.584 --> 08:23.853
hew the oats, someone has
to harvest the corn,

08:23.953 --> 08:25.154
the harrow, the tiller."

08:25.254 --> 08:26.590
[Normal voice] Why are you
gentlemen down here?

08:26.690 --> 08:28.658
Uh, now, what do you grow?
You grow cotton?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.459
Sugar.

[Indistinct conversations]

08:32.361 --> 08:34.330
Sugar...Sugar.

08:34.430 --> 08:38.101

beginning to frighten the man.

08:38.201 --> 08:39.335
Um...

08:39.435 --> 08:43.172
So, I look at my daughter's
tear-stained face

08:43.272 --> 08:46.676
and I say to her, "Maggie,

08:46.776 --> 08:49.178
that's why your daddy
sells tractors."

08:49.278 --> 08:51.848
International Harvester Farmall.

Uh, just to be clear here,
gents, we --

09:09.498 --> 09:13.069
we are here to talk about,
uh, farm equipment.

09:13.169 --> 09:15.204
Am I right?
Mm.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.707
And a streamline tractor,
you know,

09:17.807 --> 09:19.175
not only gonna
increase your harvest,

09:19.275 --> 09:21.711
but it's gonna keep
your child from tears.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.881
Oh, thank y-you.

Bite the neck, Louis.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.736
No --

09:46.836 --> 09:48.337
No, you don't bite the blood.

I'm thinking Persian.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.255
Arabesque maybe.

10:06.355 --> 10:09.659
Certainly need a more efficient
way of ridding the waste.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.594
Ugh.

10:11.695 --> 10:15.098
The first time is
the most unwieldy.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.599
Soon you'll be a natural.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.102
You'll come to enjoy it, its
variations, little surprises.

I-I gotta go home.

from the cribs.

11:30.740 --> 11:34.110

to everything but us.

11:34.210 --> 11:36.445
I should have
taught you that.

11:36.545 --> 11:41.717
The life of a vampire
has its challenges

11:41.818 --> 11:43.352
and its rewards...

11:43.452 --> 11:46.222
[Metal clicks, squeaks]

11:46.322 --> 11:50.393
...but I think New Orleans,
with its music, culture,

cuisine, shipping yards,
conventioneers,

11:55.098 --> 11:58.802
thrill-seeking tourists
far-flung from their homes,

11:58.902 --> 12:01.204

of the local police force

[Chuckles] oh, yes...

12:02.906 --> 12:04.707
[Gears click, squeak]

...the perfect setting
for a vampire home...

[Chains click]
....a vampire romance.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.696
We'll get you
your own soon enough.

12:27.797 --> 12:30.666
You've had a long life,
Louis,

12:30.766 --> 12:33.269
and such an extraordinary
one ahead.

12:36.105 --> 12:37.673
Have a rest.

12:37.773 --> 12:44.680
*

12:44.780 --> 12:45.915
It's okay.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.583
You can be on top.

12:47.683 --> 12:53.089
*

12:53.189 --> 12:55.191
Helluva bender.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.593
He rushed me headlong
through the encounter

12:57.693 --> 13:00.196
as if it were something
to put behind us.

13:00.296 --> 13:04.567
Death, rebirth, coming out,
homicide,

13:04.667 --> 13:06.569
too many firsts
for one night.

13:06.669 --> 13:08.071
Coming out?

13:08.171 --> 13:12.641
You robbed a daughter
of her father, maybe a pet pony.

13:12.741 --> 13:14.643
How's sexuality play in that?

13:14.743 --> 13:17.413
It's a complicated question,
Daniel,

13:17.513 --> 13:20.716
and we shouldn't conflate it
with the salesman's death.

13:20.816 --> 13:22.118
Humor me.

13:22.218 --> 13:27.056
To satisfy your fixation,
being transformed by Lestat,

13:27.156 --> 13:30.326
being desired by him,
bedding down with him

13:30.426 --> 13:33.930
was an overture of sorts
to that side of my nature.

13:34.030 --> 13:37.133
To the shame
of queer theorists everywhere.

13:37.233 --> 13:41.137
I got in that coffin
on my own free will.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.639
In the quiet dark,

13:43.739 --> 13:45.508
we were equals.

13:47.710 --> 13:53.516
White master, Black student,
but equal in the quiet dark.

13:53.616 --> 13:55.484
Provocation.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.686
Is this the primary tool
one walks away with

13:57.786 --> 14:00.957
after downloading
your Internet class?

14:02.058 --> 14:07.830
[Clattering]

14:07.931 --> 14:10.599
Butler #1: Rabbit, three ways,
and Vulpes rueppellii,

14:10.699 --> 14:12.301
or Ruppell's sand fox.

[Screeching]

14:21.410 --> 14:23.846
Back to the salesman
for a sec.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.015
Clearly, you were
haunted by it, the --

14:26.115 --> 14:29.352
the taste of his blood
in the back of your throat,

14:29.452 --> 14:30.653
up in your gums.

14:30.753 --> 14:32.121
Let me ask you, Daniel,

14:32.221 --> 14:37.293
do you contemplate the life
of the rabbit before you cut it?

14:37.393 --> 14:39.362
Or do you simply cut?

14:39.462 --> 14:41.730
[Crying]

14:41.830 --> 14:45.801
[Breathing heavily]

14:45.901 --> 14:48.871
Mmm.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.207
[Exhales deeply]

14:51.307 --> 14:53.242
Vampires are killers,

14:53.342 --> 14:55.911
apex predators
whose all-seeing eyes

14:56.012 --> 14:59.148
were meant to give
them detachment,

14:59.248 --> 15:03.386
the ability to see
a human life in its entirety,

15:03.486 --> 15:05.888
not with any mawkish sorrow,

15:05.989 --> 15:08.324
but with
the thrilling satisfaction

15:08.424 --> 15:13.362
of being the end
of that life

15:13.462 --> 15:17.566
and having a hand
in the divine plan.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.836
Don't expect every reader
to swallow that one.

15:20.936 --> 15:22.905
That's the purpose.

15:23.006 --> 15:26.475
Our book must be a warning
as much as anything.

15:30.946 --> 15:32.948
It was the right line
of questioning.

15:33.049 --> 15:38.287
I was haunted by the salesman,
and as a fledgling vampire,

15:38.387 --> 15:41.624
I did not readily
take to killing.

15:41.724 --> 15:44.427
When I first started
learning English, I abhorred it.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.530
Every word felt like a doorknob
falling out of my mouth.

15:47.630 --> 15:49.798
Chapeau is a hat,
étoile was a star --

15:49.898 --> 15:51.767
Killin' folks
ain't a second language.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.903
But when I started
dreaming in English,

15:55.004 --> 15:56.772
that's when I embraced it.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.875
And now, I have English
consonants to thank

15:59.975 --> 16:01.544
for this astonishing jawline.

16:01.644 --> 16:04.247
These are nightmares I'm having,
Lestat, not dreams.

16:04.347 --> 16:05.614
[Horn honks]

16:05.714 --> 16:08.751
Finn, how's your arm?

16:08.851 --> 16:10.119
Is it healing properly?

16:10.219 --> 16:11.954
You might need a proper doctor,
my friend.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.456
Me arm's fine.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.292
You let me know
if you need a doc.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.561
There is something,
Mr. du Lac.

16:18.661 --> 16:22.298
The new gaming house you're
fixing up for the alderman,

16:22.398 --> 16:24.600
I want to manage it.

16:24.700 --> 16:28.637
I'm good with people,
and I'm good with numbers.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.106
Hmm...

16:30.206 --> 16:33.609
I'll take it up
with Fenwick.

16:33.709 --> 16:34.977
Much obliged.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.780
Mm-hmm.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.648
He's lying, you know.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.117
He'll figure
I'm a bean counter.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.819
No, he wants the job
so he can steal from you.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.454
Overcharge
for drinks and women --

16:45.554 --> 16:49.158
not enough for you to notice,
but enough to make him

16:49.258 --> 16:51.160
"good extra," he calls it.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.029
And you know that 'cause
you got in his head just now?

16:54.130 --> 16:57.166
Vampires can read minds,
mon cher.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.534
Right.

16:58.634 --> 17:01.137
And you gon' sit
on that skill for how long?

17:01.237 --> 17:02.838
Hmm.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.507
You gon' make me beg?

17:04.607 --> 17:06.842
[Engine starts]

17:06.942 --> 17:08.677
One might think the ability
to read a mind

17:08.777 --> 17:12.215
a most useful gift, but,
in reality, it's quite mundane.

17:12.315 --> 17:13.682
I forget I can do it
most days.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.184
Is that right?

17:15.284 --> 17:18.354
Every human thought
boils down to three things --

17:18.454 --> 17:23.092
"I want food," "I want sex,"
"I want to go home."

17:23.192 --> 17:25.128
You see that man
right there?

17:25.228 --> 17:26.862
I want you to peel away
every sound

17:26.962 --> 17:29.298
until you find his heartbeat.

17:29.398 --> 17:31.234
Now hold the heartbeat.
[Heart beating]

17:31.334 --> 17:33.969
You hear his lungs leaking
and flooding air?

17:34.069 --> 17:36.805
His mind is just
another bodily sound.

17:36.905 --> 17:40.008
Panhandler: Day and a half
since my last meal.

17:40.109 --> 17:42.678

17:48.751 --> 17:50.653
Woman: It's not cheating
with a woman

17:50.753 --> 17:52.821

"I want sex." [Chuckles]

and be somebody.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.162
That's not --
Give it a moment.

17:59.262 --> 18:01.029

18:01.130 --> 18:03.098
Voilà. [Laughs]

just now of his house.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.513

to tell me yourself.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.795
A sacrifice is made when
the Dark Gift is shared.

18:32.895 --> 18:35.198
You can't read my mind
anymore?

18:35.298 --> 18:39.468
The architects of our creation
mean to humble us.

18:39.568 --> 18:41.770
We're at the mercy
of the other's discretion.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.872
Just like the meat.

You're not one of them anymore,
fledgling.

of your former self.

to separate from humanity

in my vampiric existence.

I felt it was essential
to maintain ties.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.767
But it was getting
more difficult.

This'll come in handy, then.

22:02.771 --> 22:04.740
Levi ain't the businessman
you are.

22:04.840 --> 22:05.908
[Chuckles]

22:06.008 --> 22:09.277
So, how's it
in the district?

22:09.378 --> 22:11.714
Must be good
if this here's extra.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.917
Oh. [Chuckles]
[Laughs]

22:15.017 --> 22:17.185
Now, I-I know it's hard
to see it now,

22:17.285 --> 22:18.821
but Mr. Fenwick
gon' have himself

22:18.921 --> 22:20.322
the most profitable
sportin' house

22:20.423 --> 22:21.524
this side of Basin Street.

22:21.624 --> 22:22.858
The alderman
certainly thinks so,

22:22.958 --> 22:27.129
but then you have to
ask yourself why he sent me.

22:27.229 --> 22:29.498
New business, new partner.

22:29.598 --> 22:34.036
No, sir, Mr. Carlo,
I-I'd do the same thing myself.

22:34.136 --> 22:37.673
You got your own
personal attorney, do you, boy?

22:37.773 --> 22:38.874
No, sir.

22:38.974 --> 22:41.343
But then, I'm not
an alderman, am I?

22:41.444 --> 22:45.013
No, you're his partner.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.715
Hm.

22:46.815 --> 22:49.217
These balconies, they have
to be decorative only.

22:49.317 --> 22:52.788
Building codes allow those
for residents, not for business.

22:52.888 --> 22:55.658
Well, that's only if you
call it a balcony.

22:55.758 --> 22:57.192
What are you callin' it?

22:57.292 --> 22:58.994
Fire escape.

23:00.463 --> 23:01.497
[Laughs]

23:01.597 --> 23:02.698
That's clever, my boy.

23:02.798 --> 23:05.033
That's very clever.
[Chuckles]

23:05.133 --> 23:06.802
Right.

23:06.902 --> 23:10.205
Dozen rooms, proper acoustics
for the musicians.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.240
You know, good
for those waitin'.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.342
Best to drown out the business
behind the walls.

23:14.443 --> 23:15.811
Yes.

23:15.911 --> 23:17.379
Oh, you really do have a mind
inside out head of yours,

23:17.480 --> 23:18.914
don't you?

23:19.014 --> 23:22.184
I-I know some of the finishes
seem penny heavy,

23:22.284 --> 23:23.886
but it's the alderman's
name goin' out there,

23:23.986 --> 23:27.422
so every detail has to shout
"exclusivity".

23:27.523 --> 23:29.758
You're bright
and industrious, huh?

23:29.858 --> 23:31.560
[Laughs]

23:31.660 --> 23:34.262
I trust you're overseeing all
stages of construction as well?

23:34.362 --> 23:35.498
Yes, sir.

23:35.598 --> 23:36.765
Fire escape.

23:36.865 --> 23:39.101
[Laughs]

23:39.201 --> 23:41.737
Now, I must say,
I had my doubts, but

23:41.837 --> 23:43.806
you really have earned
your 15%.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.076
You truly are
an exceptional Negro.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.444
Thank you, sir.
Mm-hmm.

23:49.545 --> 23:51.079
[Laughs]

23:51.179 --> 23:53.248
Ah, "fire escape."
[Laughs]

23:53.348 --> 23:55.918
Louis: "Exceptional Negro."
Ah, yes.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.520
"Thank you, sir."

23:57.620 --> 24:00.889
It was the call and response
of my entire life.

24:00.989 --> 24:05.528
I had let them talk to me
like that so long,

24:05.628 --> 24:07.062
I stopped hearing it.

24:07.162 --> 24:08.296
"Yes, sir."

24:08.396 --> 24:09.431
"Of course, sir."

24:09.532 --> 24:11.600
Subject, verb,
agreement, "sir".

24:11.700 --> 24:15.538
Smile, nod, "yes, sir."

24:15.638 --> 24:18.273
They all came from
the same organ inside me --

24:18.373 --> 24:20.776
an organ unknown to science
at the time.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.379
Because what scientist would
look for an organ found only

24:24.479 --> 24:28.116
in Black men who use
their weakness to rise?

24:28.216 --> 24:30.653
But I wasn't a man anymore.

24:30.753 --> 24:32.320
I was something else.

24:32.420 --> 24:36.258
I had powers now and decades
of rage to process,

24:36.358 --> 24:38.661
and it was both random
and unfortunate,

24:38.761 --> 24:41.630
the man picked that night
to dabble in fuckery.

24:41.730 --> 24:45.267
If not him, would have been
the next man.

24:45.367 --> 24:47.502
Louis, my boy, j-- [Screams]

24:49.104 --> 24:51.106
This was your man's esquire,
sent in his stead!

24:51.206 --> 24:52.407
I was hungry.
Stone's throw

24:52.507 --> 24:53.809
from your place
of business.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.243
What were you thinking?
He disrespected me.

24:55.343 --> 24:57.112
How did he do that?

24:57.212 --> 24:59.582
He told me I did a good job.

24:59.682 --> 25:00.983
You are a library
of confusion.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.317
There's some things...
[Door opens]

25:02.417 --> 25:03.952
...you don't get
about America, Lestat.

25:04.052 --> 25:05.988
Yes, let's have
this conversation again.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.656
Colored, white.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.157
Creole, French.

25:09.257 --> 25:12.194
Queer, half-queer,
mostly queer, what is it?

25:12.294 --> 25:14.663
Non-discriminating.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.765
[Grunts]
Complicated situation

25:16.865 --> 25:18.433
we got here's
what I'm saying.

25:18.533 --> 25:20.335
[Body thuds]
A couple of parish priests

25:20.435 --> 25:21.670
go missing, people say,
"Fine.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.171
Most likely kid-fiddlers."

25:23.271 --> 25:25.540
But this, this was
an important man in town.

25:25.641 --> 25:27.275
The police will be looking
for this man, fledgling.

25:27.375 --> 25:28.677
That's why we got
this beast, yeah?

25:28.777 --> 25:30.512
No, you need to
show restraint, fledgling!

25:30.613 --> 25:32.480
Oh, you need to stop using
that word right now,

25:32.581 --> 25:33.849
'cause it's soundin'
a little like "slave".

25:33.949 --> 25:35.150
Don't say it.
Well, that's what

25:35.250 --> 25:36.685
it fuckin' sound like.
[Sighs]

25:36.785 --> 25:38.120
It's what it feel like
sometimes.

25:38.220 --> 25:39.888
And the carousel
comes around again.

25:39.988 --> 25:41.189
Fuck you.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.091
[Speaking French]

25:44.793 --> 25:46.662
[Sighs]
[Door closes]

25:52.467 --> 25:54.402
Lestat: I don't like
sleeping angry.

26:00.508 --> 26:03.011
For the record, if disrespect
was done to you,

26:03.111 --> 26:05.013
I would have
killed him myself.

26:14.422 --> 26:17.425
Well, what can I do
to make it up to you?

26:17.525 --> 26:21.063
I wanna buy
the Fair Play Saloon.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.330
That's ambitious.

26:22.430 --> 26:24.800
If you don't wanna help,
I'll do it myself.

26:27.135 --> 26:29.404
Ridiculous of you to mix human
and vampire business.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.306
It always ends poorly.

26:35.310 --> 26:37.045
But how can I stop you?

26:40.649 --> 26:42.250
How can I say no to you?

26:42.350 --> 26:45.754
*

26:45.854 --> 26:49.257
Man: Sign here and here
and here.

26:49.357 --> 26:52.094
Tom: Well, I do not see
the clause in this paperwork

26:52.194 --> 26:55.230
wherein I continue to eat,
drink, and fornicate

26:55.330 --> 26:56.732
on the house.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.100
Louis?

26:58.200 --> 27:00.769
You have my word, and my word
is thicker than paper...

27:00.869 --> 27:02.771
Mm.
...Tom.

27:02.871 --> 27:07.142
Louis: It was a grand and loving
gesture on Lestat's part.

27:07.242 --> 27:11.213
That's a mighty tall ladder
you're climbin', Mr. du Lac.

27:11.313 --> 27:12.748
And I was now the owner

27:12.848 --> 27:15.718
of the brightest club
in the district.

27:15.818 --> 27:18.220
My club, my rules.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.588
[Indistinct conversations]

27:20.689 --> 27:23.091
I opened the doors to anyone
with money to burn.

27:23.191 --> 27:26.762
I paid the staff better,
paid the band better,

27:26.862 --> 27:28.764
all the while helping those
who had been with me

27:28.864 --> 27:30.966
down the block
to better themselves.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.502
Miss Williams.
Mr. Du Lac.

27:34.602 --> 27:36.171
And it was a pointless point
of pride

27:36.271 --> 27:40.475
that I paid back every cent
I borrowed from Lestat.

27:40.575 --> 27:43.812
It was everything I had
ever wanted or wished for.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.915
And it doubled nicely
as a revolving door of prey.

27:47.015 --> 27:50.452
You fellas know where I can find
the Fair Play Saloon?

27:50.552 --> 27:52.320
You about five years late.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.989
So how long are you
in town for?

27:54.089 --> 27:55.423
Man:
Uh, yeah, I'm just --

27:55.523 --> 27:57.525
From 1912 to 1917,

27:57.625 --> 28:00.028
I made a mountain of money,

28:00.128 --> 28:04.366
enough to retire
and be buried like a pharaoh.

28:04.466 --> 28:09.604
But in the essential duties
of the executor in charge,

28:09.704 --> 28:13.575
I had been most delinquent.

28:14.376 --> 28:17.813
We named him Benjamin.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.682
Benny.
[Baby coos]

28:20.783 --> 28:22.851
Did you even meet the twins?

28:22.951 --> 28:25.353
No, ma'am.
Ma'am?

28:25.453 --> 28:27.222
I look that old to you?

28:27.322 --> 28:30.692
No, I mean, I haven't had
the pleasure

28:30.793 --> 28:32.027
of meetin' more of the family.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.162
I've been so busy with work,
and, you know --

28:34.262 --> 28:35.964
Him?

28:36.064 --> 28:38.867
You know my situation.

28:38.967 --> 28:41.703
How are things
with you and...

28:41.804 --> 28:43.005
It's Lestat still, right?

28:43.105 --> 28:45.173
Yes, it's Lestat.
Shh!

28:49.611 --> 28:51.446
[Baby coos]

28:53.148 --> 28:57.019
Got some gumbo
on the stove still.

28:57.119 --> 29:00.188
Tasted great this evening.

29:00.288 --> 29:01.389
Let me fix you something.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.725
I'm good.

this one.

The other two...

29:15.537 --> 29:17.239
the twins?

No, please.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.947
You look good.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.949
You should stay the night.

to see you.

let's see.

Okay. [Sighs]

30:44.259 --> 30:46.094
I no longer kill.

My last victim
was in the year 2000.

30:48.964 --> 30:50.465
Some Y2K disagreement?

30:50.565 --> 30:53.101
I want our readers
to understand that.

30:53.201 --> 30:54.602
Okay.

30:54.702 --> 30:56.271
Did you eat the baby?

30:56.371 --> 30:59.374
I sit here a master
of my instincts.

30:59.474 --> 31:00.542
Mm-hmm.

31:00.642 --> 31:02.610
And what about the others
out there?

31:02.710 --> 31:04.712
Have they mastered theirs?

31:04.812 --> 31:06.448
Just the opposite.

31:06.548 --> 31:09.351
Most of them are slaves
to the blood,

31:09.451 --> 31:12.988
exhausted from decades,
centuries of hiding,

31:13.088 --> 31:15.390
giddy to increase
their numbers.

31:15.490 --> 31:17.025
Mm-hmm.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.626
Two questions --

31:18.726 --> 31:20.062
did you eat the baby?

31:20.162 --> 31:24.566
And is the pandemic the opening
they've been waiting for?

31:24.666 --> 31:28.636
Pandemic, the unraveling
of geopolitical foundations.

31:28.736 --> 31:29.837
And you know this how?

31:29.938 --> 31:31.974
You guys have a thread
on 8chan?

31:32.074 --> 31:33.208
I hear them.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.010
Our thoughts can travel
thousands of miles

31:35.110 --> 31:36.378
to one another.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.347
I can stand out on my balcony,
close my eyes,

31:39.447 --> 31:41.516
and they're plotting
speeds to me.

31:41.616 --> 31:45.087
One of them,
a brute in Madagascar,

31:45.187 --> 31:47.822
called it
"the great conversion".

31:47.922 --> 31:49.257
The great conversion?

31:49.357 --> 31:51.994
Well, good luck with that,
because most people I know like

31:52.094 --> 31:53.895
to play little ball
in the afternoon,

31:53.996 --> 31:55.897
or maybe going down
to the beach,

31:55.998 --> 31:57.499
catching a few rays.

31:57.599 --> 31:58.833
Yes.

31:58.933 --> 32:01.603
What on earth would
a meth-addicted son

32:01.703 --> 32:04.672
of a coal miner in West Virginia
want with eternal life?

32:04.772 --> 32:06.241
Did you eat the baby?

32:06.341 --> 32:07.875
Or the Arab youth whose family
were wiped from existence...

32:07.976 --> 32:09.711

...by a Western drone?

He's American, Damek.

[Blood squelches]

32:33.201 --> 32:35.270
You like Dubai?

32:35.370 --> 32:37.772
I haven't had the time
to sight-see.

32:37.872 --> 32:40.275
[Blood squelches]
Go to Kite Beach.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.609
It's good.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.445
Kites.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.780
[Slurps] Mmm.

[Slurps]

32:49.684 --> 32:50.885
Thank you, Damek.

32:50.985 --> 32:53.088
See you soon.

32:53.188 --> 32:55.957
As I was saying,
I no longer kill.

32:56.058 --> 32:58.493
You might have
a drinking problem.

32:58.593 --> 33:00.362
Rashid!

33:01.529 --> 33:04.966
[Body thuds, Damek grunts]

33:05.067 --> 33:07.169

Louis: I had him in my arms...
[Crying continues]

33:41.969 --> 33:43.971
...and I was ready
to tear into him.

33:44.072 --> 33:46.674
I'm never gon'
get control over it.

33:46.774 --> 33:50.145
You've been skipping
meals lately.

33:50.245 --> 33:51.513
Don't think
I haven't noticed.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.382
It was my nephew.

33:54.482 --> 33:58.153
You have to stop seeing them,
Louis.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.622
They'll grow fearful of you
if they haven't already.

34:00.722 --> 34:01.856
I can't do it.

34:01.956 --> 34:04.292
It's a rite of passage
for all of us.

34:04.392 --> 34:06.461
If you love your family,
as I know you do,

34:06.561 --> 34:08.630
spare them all the pain
that you are causing them.

34:08.730 --> 34:11.666
I ain't never gon' have
a family of my own, am I?

34:11.766 --> 34:15.170
No sons, no daughters.

34:15.270 --> 34:17.172
I'm your family, Louis.

34:17.272 --> 34:19.741
You should just throw me
in the incinerator

34:19.841 --> 34:20.975
and make another one.

34:21.075 --> 34:23.745
Hmm. And what a waste
that would be.

34:23.845 --> 34:26.881
I have two centuries walked
this Earth and can report,

34:26.981 --> 34:28.850
you have no twin.

34:28.950 --> 34:33.555
No one as angry, as stubborn,
as unaccommodating,

34:33.655 --> 34:35.490
as maddening --
Sound like trash to me.

34:35.590 --> 34:40.128
As loving, as dedicated,
as thoughtful,

34:40.228 --> 34:42.830
as imperfectly perfect
as you've become.

34:42.930 --> 34:45.567
You're a challenge every sunset,
Saint Louis,

34:45.667 --> 34:47.602
and I'd have it no other way.

34:48.536 --> 34:51.906
Here's an idea --
let's take a holiday.

34:52.006 --> 34:54.242
What about Rome?

34:54.342 --> 34:55.710
Rome? R-Rome, Italy?

34:55.810 --> 34:57.945
Would you prefer
Rome, Wisconsin?

34:58.045 --> 34:59.947
I can't just pick up
and go to Rome.

35:00.047 --> 35:01.383
I got a business to run.

35:01.483 --> 35:03.751
Leave the Azalea to the capable
hands of Miss Bricktop

35:03.851 --> 35:05.052
and follow the Appian Way.

35:05.153 --> 35:06.921
How you gon' get coffins
across the Atlantic?

35:07.021 --> 35:09.757
It can be an inconvenience,
but not impossible, obviously.

35:09.857 --> 35:12.427
Well, how do you get them
from ship to train to cab?

35:12.527 --> 35:14.929
Ah, the changeovers can
be jarring, I'll give you that.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.432
Well, maybe there's a deaf,
blind porter we can hire

35:17.532 --> 35:19.434
and kill
when we get to the hotel.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.968
Well, I had been
thinking the Inghilterra.

35:21.068 --> 35:23.638
Imagine hunting between
the Caffe Greco

35:23.738 --> 35:25.072
and the Spanish Steps.

35:25.173 --> 35:26.641
But you've made your point.
Pity.

35:26.741 --> 35:30.445
We'll just have to settle
for Rome coming to us.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.113
Oh, another opera.

35:32.214 --> 35:33.448
Not another opera.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.550
Donizetti's comic masterpiece,
"Don Pasquale."

35:35.650 --> 35:38.085
I was an acquaintance of his,
and I saw the premiere

35:38.186 --> 35:40.054
at the Salle Ventadour
73 years ago,

35:40.154 --> 35:41.923
and I remember it like
it was yesterday.

35:42.023 --> 35:43.325
I almost ate my nephew,
Lestat.

35:43.425 --> 35:44.659
It's the soprano
Sofia Consoli's American debut,

35:44.759 --> 35:46.261
her fifth stop in
a 22-city tour,

35:46.361 --> 35:48.129
so the orchestra should be
in excellent form.

35:48.230 --> 35:52.534
I have a private box,
and I had tuxedos made.

35:56.103 --> 35:58.473
I've been neglectful
of our romance.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.309
*

36:01.409 --> 36:06.314
And a steadfast pupil
deserves a divine reward.

36:06.414 --> 36:10.017
He had a way about him,
those first years, Lestat.

36:10.117 --> 36:13.821
Preternaturally charming,
occasionally thoughtful.

36:13.921 --> 36:18.025
He was my murderer, my mentor,
my lover, and my maker --

36:18.125 --> 36:20.262
all of those things
at once.

36:20.362 --> 36:23.265
He didn't choose me
to be his doormat.

36:23.365 --> 36:25.467
I knew he enjoyed it
when I fought back,

36:25.567 --> 36:28.603
but there was present

36:28.703 --> 36:31.873
a kind of worship on my part.

36:31.973 --> 36:35.810
The earth beneath me
always felt liquid.

36:35.910 --> 36:39.213
*

36:39.314 --> 36:41.349
The status I enjoyed
in Storyville

36:41.449 --> 36:44.185
did not extend itself
to the operators and patrons

36:44.286 --> 36:48.189
of the French Opera House
on Bourbon and Toulouse.

36:48.290 --> 36:52.360
We did what we always did
to avoid conflicts there.

36:52.460 --> 36:57.899
I performed as his valet,
walked a pace behind him,

36:57.999 --> 37:01.369
took his overcoat
once we found our seats,

37:01.469 --> 37:03.137
remained standing
in the back of the box

37:03.237 --> 37:06.308
until the lights went down,
and only joined next to him

37:06.408 --> 37:09.911
once the overture had begun.

37:10.011 --> 37:11.746
And again...
[Applause]

37:11.846 --> 37:14.549
...he had a way about him,

37:14.649 --> 37:18.820
so that as I sat there
trying to practice restraint,

37:18.920 --> 37:21.489
simmering in my indignation...

37:21.589 --> 37:23.358
*

37:23.458 --> 37:28.029
...Lestat seized it as
opportunity to disarm me.

37:28.129 --> 37:30.765
There is one thing
about being a vampire

37:30.865 --> 37:33.401
that I most fear
above all else...

37:33.501 --> 37:35.837
*

37:35.937 --> 37:37.439
...and that is loneliness.

37:39.341 --> 37:42.276
You can't imagine
the emptiness --

37:42.377 --> 37:46.414
a void stretching out
for decades at a time.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.883
*

37:48.983 --> 37:52.587
You take this feeling away
from me, Louis.

37:52.687 --> 37:58.092
We must stay together
and take precaution

37:58.192 --> 37:59.761
and never part.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.897
*

38:02.997 --> 38:05.733
How many of us
are out there?

38:05.833 --> 38:07.769
We can't be the only ones.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.203
How many vampires?

38:09.303 --> 38:11.639
*

38:11.739 --> 38:14.308
Not many, I'm afraid.

38:14.409 --> 38:17.645
Maybe 100,

38:17.745 --> 38:19.347
101.

38:21.248 --> 38:23.418
[Applause]

38:23.518 --> 38:31.292
*

38:31.393 --> 38:33.628
Louis: The touring production
of "Don Pasquale"

38:33.728 --> 38:35.963
was a cheap affair,

38:36.063 --> 38:40.768
but the soprano was everything
Lestat said she would be.

38:42.336 --> 38:44.972
[Singing in Italian]

38:45.072 --> 38:51.112
*

38:51.212 --> 38:54.148
And music,

38:54.248 --> 38:59.320
that was where Lestat
separated man from food.

38:59.421 --> 39:03.190
Music
pierced his damned soul.

39:03.290 --> 39:05.960
And any human who were involved
with the creation of it

39:06.060 --> 39:09.931
existed on an elevated plane
in his eyes.

39:10.031 --> 39:13.601
I was moved to see he too
had his human attachments.

39:13.701 --> 39:15.102
[Singing in Italian]

39:15.202 --> 39:18.072
And this woman sang for us,
it seemed,

39:20.074 --> 39:22.009
articulating the difficult love

39:22.109 --> 39:26.047
we often had trouble
expressing ourselves.

39:26.147 --> 39:27.882
There was one issue, however,

39:27.982 --> 39:32.454
that threatened to pop the
bubble of our Italian holiday,

39:32.554 --> 39:35.857
and that was the tenor
playing Ernesto.

39:35.957 --> 39:38.025
[Both vocalizing]

39:38.125 --> 39:41.295
*

39:41.395 --> 39:43.531
To be kind,
he did not live

39:43.631 --> 39:46.701
in the soprano's
vocal stratosphere...

39:46.801 --> 39:49.036
[Singing in Italian]

39:49.136 --> 39:53.207
*

39:53.307 --> 39:55.577
Ah.

39:55.677 --> 39:59.246
...and Lestat was unamused.

39:59.346 --> 40:03.150
[Singing continues]

40:03.250 --> 40:04.886
I don't understand how someone
like that

40:04.986 --> 40:07.555
can make it onto a stage.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.724
I understand they're
a rogue company,

40:09.824 --> 40:13.394
but are they pulling talent
from roadside gas stations?

40:13.495 --> 40:17.031
[Singing continues]

40:17.131 --> 40:19.333
[Tenor sings flat note]
[Grunts]

40:19.433 --> 40:21.869
[Singing in Italian]

40:39.153 --> 40:40.722
[Cheers and applause]

40:40.822 --> 40:43.424
It didn't help matters that
the majority of the audience

40:43.525 --> 40:45.192
didn't seem to notice.

40:45.292 --> 40:49.931
And so Lestat oscillated
his disdain between the tenor

40:50.031 --> 40:53.901
and the witless swamp-dwellers
in the seats below.

40:54.001 --> 40:55.970
The curtain fell
like a guillotine,

40:56.070 --> 41:00.241
and Lestat leapt to his feet
in mock appreciation,

41:00.341 --> 41:03.811
which could mean
only one thing --

41:03.911 --> 41:05.446
the hunt was on.

41:05.547 --> 41:07.615
[Applause continues]

41:07.715 --> 41:11.452
I stood in the lobby bar,
nursing my complicity,

41:11.553 --> 41:13.655
as rounds were bought
and fake praise

41:13.755 --> 41:16.724
was lavished upon the mark.

41:16.824 --> 41:22.830
And I was surprised by a wave
of nausea coming over me.

41:22.930 --> 41:25.967
Here I was,
six years his pupil,

41:26.067 --> 41:29.737
and it was no different
than the tractor salesman.

41:29.837 --> 41:33.240
This poor soul
was someone's son,

41:33.340 --> 41:35.176
someone's brother,

41:35.276 --> 41:36.611
and he was to be butchered.

41:36.711 --> 41:38.312
For what?

41:38.412 --> 41:39.914
An offending note?

41:40.014 --> 41:42.316
[Singing in Italian]

41:42.416 --> 41:47.454
*

41:47.555 --> 41:49.256
Wrong.

41:49.356 --> 41:51.626
[Singing in Italian]

41:51.726 --> 41:55.697
He sat the tenor down, opened
up the score in front of him

41:55.797 --> 41:58.332
and sang as it was written.

41:58.432 --> 42:01.168
And you could see all the
doubts the young man had

42:01.268 --> 42:02.937
about his art,

42:03.037 --> 42:08.843
about himself, exposed on
his nodding, agreeable face.

42:08.943 --> 42:14.381
Lestat removed a lifetime
of confidence, of joy,

42:14.481 --> 42:16.317
in less than half an hour.

42:16.417 --> 42:19.621

[Gasps, groans]

42:40.407 --> 42:41.643
[Body thuds]

42:41.743 --> 42:44.812
So no more of your sound
can pollute this world.

42:44.912 --> 42:47.749
Why do you do this, Lestat?
[Man gurgles]

42:47.849 --> 42:49.651
Well, I like to do it.
I enjoy it.

42:49.751 --> 42:50.885
Well, I don't.

42:50.985 --> 42:52.419
You don't have
to humiliate him.

42:52.519 --> 42:55.256
Well, I don't say that
you have to enjoy it!

42:55.356 --> 42:58.926
Kill them swiftly
if you have to, but do it!

42:59.026 --> 43:00.862
Embrace what you are!

43:00.962 --> 43:03.264
You are a killer, Louis!

43:03.364 --> 43:06.200
[Gasping]

43:06.300 --> 43:08.269
Come now, love,

43:08.369 --> 43:10.504
let's get you to
the couch to die.

43:10.604 --> 43:12.406
Louis: I was in denial.

43:12.506 --> 43:14.709
For in bringing death,

43:14.809 --> 43:16.744
Lestat was an artist.

43:16.844 --> 43:22.750
He had cut the man tenderly so
that he could not call for help,

43:22.850 --> 43:28.856
but also so that his death
was slow, meditative.

43:28.956 --> 43:32.626
And I felt a charge
witnessing it.

43:32.727 --> 43:36.197
I listened to his thoughts
as Lestat drank,

43:36.297 --> 43:39.133
and this time,
they came with vision.

43:39.233 --> 43:43.537
I could see his life
as he remembered it.

43:43.637 --> 43:46.307
Scenes from
an Italian childhood --

43:46.407 --> 43:49.944
the Easter pageant
in a mountain village,

43:50.044 --> 43:53.314
an afternoon with his father
on the sea,

43:53.414 --> 43:54.749
watching the fishing boats

43:54.849 --> 43:58.085
slowly encircle
a school of tuna.

43:59.887 --> 44:04.391
Something about a wet piece
of bread in his pocket.

44:04.491 --> 44:08.830
If you'd listen to me, if you
finally submit to your nature,

44:08.930 --> 44:14.568
you will be filled, Louis,
with all the life you can hold.

44:14.668 --> 44:18.605
You will see death
in all its beauty,

44:18.706 --> 44:23.110
life as it is only known
at the very point of the death.

44:23.210 --> 44:24.611
You alone, of all creatures,

44:24.712 --> 44:27.949
can see death
with that impunity.

44:28.049 --> 44:30.985
You alone,
under the rising moon...

44:31.085 --> 44:33.320
*

44:33.420 --> 44:36.991
...can strike
like the hand of God.

44:37.091 --> 44:41.662
And I'll say it
for a third time and no more --

44:41.763 --> 44:46.267
he had a way about him.

44:46.367 --> 44:51.338
And I was still very much
under his power.

44:51.438 --> 44:55.609
We would drain the tenor
for hours that night.

44:55.709 --> 44:59.680
Lestat completely enthralled.

44:59.781 --> 45:03.117
Myself, pretending to be.

45:03.217 --> 45:06.187
*

45:06.287 --> 45:08.022
Afraid to disappoint.

45:08.122 --> 45:13.527
*

45:13.627 --> 45:15.729
Lestat was wrong.

45:15.830 --> 45:18.365
I was never going to be
a natural.

45:18.465 --> 45:21.502
I was never going to savor
the aftertaste.

45:21.602 --> 45:26.240
I was a shame-ridden second,
a -- a fumbling,

45:26.340 --> 45:31.378
despondent killer,
a botched vampire.

45:31.478 --> 45:35.516
*

45:35.616 --> 45:38.719
I try to have a human dish
once a week

45:38.820 --> 45:41.188
to maintain the thread.

45:41.288 --> 45:44.191
There was an offhanded remark in
your memoir about this dessert.

45:44.291 --> 45:45.759
I hope you don't mind.

45:45.860 --> 45:47.728
[Chuckles softly]

45:47.829 --> 45:53.067

45:53.167 --> 45:58.372
*

45:58.472 --> 46:01.575
What does this taste
like to you?

46:01.675 --> 46:04.545
Like almost all human food --

46:04.645 --> 46:07.248
like paste,

46:07.348 --> 46:09.116
chalk,

46:09.216 --> 46:12.453
like soap.

46:12.553 --> 46:17.458
This is the dessert I had after
I proposed to my first wife,

46:17.558 --> 46:19.460
after I got my shit together.

46:19.560 --> 46:21.262
We were in Paris.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.597
Little cafe
on the Rue Servandoni,

46:23.697 --> 46:25.399
up the way from Saint-Sulpice.

46:25.499 --> 46:28.102
I know it.
It's a beautiful street.

46:28.202 --> 46:30.604
*

46:30.704 --> 46:32.573
Alice --

46:32.673 --> 46:36.110
half of her eyebrow
was blond, like a mutt.

46:36.210 --> 46:38.579
She always dyed it back
to brown.

46:38.679 --> 46:42.950
*

46:43.050 --> 46:45.953
I liked it
when she left it alone.

46:46.053 --> 46:52.259

46:52.359 --> 46:54.395
[Laptop whirs]

48:15.642 --> 48:24.751

48:26.153 --> 48:27.888
Louis:
Do you ever think that we --

48:27.989 --> 48:29.923
that's to say, our kind --

48:30.024 --> 48:32.359
were put on earth
for a larger purpose?

48:32.459 --> 48:37.398
*

48:37.498 --> 48:39.166
How was your night?
Fine.

48:39.266 --> 48:41.702
Jonah: So you a big-shot
businessman now.

48:41.802 --> 48:44.071
I like a little variety.

48:44.171 --> 48:45.739
The devil walks at night.

48:45.839 --> 48:46.940
*

48:47.041 --> 48:48.242
[Screams]

48:48.342 --> 48:51.378
Louis: Is my very nature
that of the devil?

48:51.478 --> 48:54.948
*

48:55.716 --> 49:01.955

49:02.056 --> 49:05.259
Two vampires walk into a church.
That's where we left off.

49:05.359 --> 49:08.062
Blissing out...
post priest-icide.

49:08.162 --> 49:11.398
Jones: Episode 2, "After the
Phantoms of Your Former Self" --

49:11.498 --> 49:14.468
it is Louis de Pointe du Lac
as fledgling vampire

49:14.568 --> 49:17.571
and Lestat as
his master teacher.

49:17.671 --> 49:20.241
Are you hungry, Louis?
Uh-huh.

49:20.341 --> 49:22.943
Louis trying to figure out
what this new world is,

49:23.044 --> 49:26.080
what the burdens are,
and how to use these powers.

49:26.180 --> 49:27.914
His mind is just
another bodily sound.

49:28.015 --> 49:30.384
Day and a half
since my last meal.

49:30.484 --> 49:32.453
Part of the tension here
becomes about

49:32.553 --> 49:34.321
"I am a different species
than these people."

49:34.421 --> 49:37.124
So if you're a vampire
and you're a Black man

49:37.224 --> 49:38.792
and people don't know
that you're a vampire,

49:38.892 --> 49:41.428
you are going to run up against
a couple of things.

49:41.528 --> 49:43.830
Bright and industrious,
huh?

49:43.930 --> 49:45.632
[Laughs]

49:45.732 --> 49:47.601
And you don't have to put up
with that bullshit anymore.

49:47.701 --> 49:50.304
Louis: It was both
random and unfortunate

49:50.404 --> 49:52.973
the man picked that night
to dabble in fuckery.

49:53.074 --> 49:54.308
[Snarls]

49:54.408 --> 49:56.777
But you can't be dropping bodies
left and right.

49:56.877 --> 49:58.745
What were you thinking?
He disrespected me.

49:58.845 --> 50:00.614
How did he do that?

50:00.714 --> 50:01.948
He told me
I did a good job.

50:02.049 --> 50:04.151
[Sighs] You are
a library of confusion.

50:04.251 --> 50:06.287
We get to have a little fun
with race and sexuality

50:06.387 --> 50:08.155
and then the burdens
of an interracial,

50:08.255 --> 50:09.856
interspecies relationship.

50:09.956 --> 50:11.625
You need to show restraint,
fledgling!

50:11.725 --> 50:13.527
You need to stop
using that word right now,

50:13.627 --> 50:15.296
'cause it sounded
a little like "slave."
Don't say it.

50:15.396 --> 50:16.863
Well, that's what
it fuckin' sound like.

50:16.963 --> 50:20.667
And also the professor-student
relationship. It's messy.

50:20.767 --> 50:23.204
But something about
taking of human life

50:23.304 --> 50:26.640
is not sitting well
with Louis...

50:26.740 --> 50:29.876
and the complications of trying
to have a foot in both worlds...

50:29.976 --> 50:32.313
I -- I need to go home.
...sort of reminds him

50:32.413 --> 50:34.648
of what a monster
he thinks he's become.

50:34.748 --> 50:37.518
[Both vocalizing]

50:37.618 --> 50:39.620
The killing of the tenor is,
I think,

50:39.720 --> 50:41.555
the final sort of straw
that, like,

50:41.655 --> 50:43.890
"this is never gonna be
comfortable for me."

50:43.990 --> 50:45.526
[Gasps]

50:45.626 --> 50:47.728

50:47.828 --> 50:50.564
"I'm never gonna be a vampire
like Lestat."

50:50.664 --> 50:53.734
Lestat: If you finally submit
to your nature,

50:53.834 --> 50:56.203
you'll see death
in all its beauty.

50:56.303 --> 50:58.205
While he is
at his most articulate

50:58.305 --> 51:00.807
about what this is about,
Louis fully admits it --

51:00.907 --> 51:02.343
"I'm not buying it."

51:02.443 --> 51:05.346
But he was still so
under the throes of Lestat,

51:05.446 --> 51:07.114
so he fakes it.

51:08.182 --> 51:10.517
Louis:
Afraid to disappoint.

51:10.617 --> 51:12.886
Jones: The idea of being
a botched vampire,

51:12.986 --> 51:16.857
that slowly begins to kind of
open up something inside Molloy.

51:16.957 --> 51:20.026
I was never going to
savor the aftertaste.

51:20.127 --> 51:22.563
I was
a shame-ridden second,

51:22.663 --> 51:26.433
a fumbling,
despondent killer.

51:26.533 --> 51:28.202
Like any good journalist,
he's sniffing around

51:28.302 --> 51:30.537
for what the armor is,
but there are things

51:30.637 --> 51:32.706
in this story where you
sit back and say,

51:32.806 --> 51:34.675
"Hmm, vampires --
they're just like us."

51:34.775 --> 51:39.946
This is the dessert I had after
I proposed to my first wife.

51:40.046 --> 51:41.415
He starts opening up
a little bit,

51:41.515 --> 51:43.750
catches himself
and turns off the interview

51:43.850 --> 51:47.053
and I think begins to, you know,
start that road down

51:47.154 --> 51:48.589
"how am I gonna
empathize against

51:48.689 --> 51:52.025
this predator
that feasts on people like me?"

51:52.125 --> 51:57.864
