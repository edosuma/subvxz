<i>If you haven 't watched</i> The O.C.,
<i>here's what you've missed.</i>

00:03.560 --> 00:06.154
- I'm not interested in Marissa, all right?
- Then prove it.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.795
Just come down, Johnny, please?

00:09.400 --> 00:11.436
- You're glad he's gone?
- Not gonna answer that.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.919
- What do you want?
- You.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.513
Late night last night?

00:14.680 --> 00:17.069
Boy likes girl. Girl has access
to influential father.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.639
Boy's boss needs to close a deal.

00:18.800 --> 00:19.949
- I'm in.
- You're in?

00:20.120 --> 00:21.553
Caleb would've been proud.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.517
- Where's the line?
- I'm not worried about you...

00:23.680 --> 00:25.033
...knowing where the line is.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.634
Are you a friend of Johnny's?
I'm his cousin, Sadie.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.394
I was wondering if I could
give you a hand.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.073
We got unfinished business.

00:33.640 --> 00:34.834
Come on.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.279
We should take our pants off.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.237
You wouldn't have come
if you didn't want to see me.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.992
- Go away.
- What the hell's he doing here?

00:48.760 --> 00:51.832
<i>Some might say as a teenage girl</i>
<i>growing up in Orange County...</i>

00:52.000 --> 00:53.991
<i>... everything is ours for the taking.</i>

00:54.160 --> 00:55.957
<i>But sooner or later,</i>
<i>we have to choose.</i>

00:59.080 --> 01:01.753
- Hey.
<i>- You don 't choose to choose...</i>

01:01.920 --> 01:03.956
<i>...choosing chooses you.</i>
- Okay, what's that?

01:04.519 --> 01:06.556
<i>And when we choose,</i>
<i>we're left with our ch...</i>

01:07.880 --> 01:10.155
Oh, my God, you're listening
to your own voice.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.880
All the TV shows I watch,
all these women have voiceovers.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.792
They gave one to April on <i>The Valley.</i>

01:14.960 --> 01:17.349
Where most of these voiceovers
don't make much sense...

01:17.520 --> 01:19.875
...they make your life
seem dramatic and meaningful.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.712
Our lives need to be
more dramatic?

01:21.880 --> 01:23.199
No, not yours.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.875
It's our senior year, second semester.
I think things should be more poignant.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.315
- We don't have much time.
- You're right about that.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.471
We don't have much time.
We're late, come on.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.915
- Seth and Ryan are waiting.
- I'll be right there.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.997
<i>No one said choosing would be easy.</i>

01:39.160 --> 01:41.355
<i>But not choosing is even less easy.</i>

01:41.520 --> 01:43.829
<i>Or something.</i>

01:46.160 --> 01:49.118
- So where is Atwood, anyway?
- I don't know, and I don't care.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.077
Yeah, I haven't seen him for a while.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.754
Yeah, but look at it this way:
The hot tub's roomier.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.832
Plus, two girls and a guy.
I like those odds.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.719
You know what? You're right, Cohen.

02:00.880 --> 02:05.556
- Hot tub, house to ourselves...
- I have been kind of Ionely.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.153
And I have kissed a girl before.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.910
And I've always wanted to.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.116
You guys are kidding.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.077
You know what they say, Cohen.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.312
- What happens in the hot tub...
- Stays in the hot tub.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.278
Yeah, you guys are really committed
to this joke. I commend you.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.192
- Who's joking?
- Yeah.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.191
- Cohen, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.557
- You're not man enough for two girls?
- I gotta call Ryan.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.634
- Be gentle, that pipe is old.
- lf you're such an expert...

02:32.800 --> 02:35.394
...why'd you ask for my help?
- I didn't ask for your help.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.437
- I almost got it. Almost...
- Wait, hold on.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.194
- Not so hard, you're gonna break it.
- It's not gonna break.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.590
- Don't twist so hard. Turn it off!
- I got it.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.830
- Thank you for the help.
- Here's a towel.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.673
Anytime, at your service.
You're too dry, though.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.796
- That's mean.
- You okay?

02:49.960 --> 02:51.234
Fine.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.511
I'll get that. And some towels.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.714
Hey, man.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.752
Is this the Harper residence?
We've got some questions, ma'am.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.036
- You were supposed to be here.
- I know, sorry.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.270
We just finished painting
and the sink clogged.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.476
I've got girls in bikinis
trying to seduce me.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.438
Which sounds awesome.
But I'm scared.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.558
- I'm wet and I'm cold, Ryan.
- Okay, all right. I'll be right there.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.632
- Just gotta towel off.
- Why do you need to towel off?

03:31.440 --> 03:33.670
- You should probably go.
- What are they doing here?

03:33.840 --> 03:35.512
They have some questions
about Johnny.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.989
- What kind of questions?
- They're saying his death...

03:38.160 --> 03:41.914
...might not have been an accident.
- No. I saw what happened. I was there.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.277
I know. So do they.
Just go home. I got this.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.396
- You sure?
- Go.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.396
Yeah. Okay. All right.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.235
I was thinking of having a party.
Something small.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.278
- Maybe you, me, Seth, Ryan...
- That's not a party.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.714
That's a double date.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.711
A double date?
Coop, that's a great idea.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.599
- Why don't we do it this weekend?
- Can we just play it by ear?

05:05.760 --> 05:09.435
Why? So you can come up with some
last-minute excuse to get out of it?

05:09.600 --> 05:12.239
Hey, it wasn't me who didn't show
last night. That was Ryan.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.437
That's true. Did you guys
come up with some sort of system?

05:15.600 --> 05:19.149
Look, I'll call him later. We'll figure out
a time to sit down and talk. Okay?

05:19.320 --> 05:22.517
I love our pep talks. So affirming.
Wish I could have them with my dad.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.638
- What's wrong with your dad?
- He's been working hellacious hours...

05:25.800 --> 05:27.279
...ever since Stepmonster left.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.158
He was asleep when I left
this morning.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.151
- Maybe he's just busy.
- That's the point.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.835
He's been burying himself in his work
to avoid staring into the emotional void.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.798
- I'm sure he'll snap out of it.
- Yeah, so will you and Ryan.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.237
What did I tell you? I'll be outside.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.232
Hello?

05:48.640 --> 05:49.914
Yeah, this is.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.472
No, Aunt Gwen,
you just stay up there with my mom.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.552
I don't know, but I'll figure it out.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.835
I love what you've done there. Probably
get a cable show to pay for that.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.230
HGTV's <i>Extremely Sad</i>
<i>Home Makeovers.</i>

06:04.400 --> 06:06.630
No one's taking your house.
I promise.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.553
- Okay. I love you. Bye.
- Hey.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.280
I just thought I'd stop by,
see how everything's going.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.590
The bank's gonna foreclose
on my aunt's mortgage.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.115
And until the cops figure out
how Johnny died...

06:17.280 --> 06:19.589
...there's no insurance money
from his accident.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.513
So now the insurance
company's frozen the claim.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.989
- He fell off a cliff.
- Do they think Ryan pushed him?

06:25.160 --> 06:26.798
Guess they've recovered
new evidence.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.349
- What evidence?
- I don't know. They wouldn't say.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.110
Don't worry,
it's not you they're interested in.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.998
They asked questions
about Marissa.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.833
- And?
- And I said they should talk to her.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.752
As you can tell, we are over
our advertising budget for the month.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.911
Maybe we can put something on
OCNewMatch. com.

06:44.080 --> 06:47.152
We could call our Newport publisher,
see if he could put NewMatch...

06:47.320 --> 06:49.356
...in one of his high-end
lifestyle magazines.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.590
You want some more coffee?

06:51.760 --> 06:54.069
Julie, are you even listening to me?

06:54.240 --> 06:57.676
Yes, of course I'm listening. You've been
talking ever since I got here.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.755
What's going on?
You've been zombie-like all week.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.231
Another late one with Doc Roberts.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.231
In the back of his Maserati, no less.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.595
I didn't know Maseratis
had back seats.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.634
Maybe you two should stop
sneaking around and go public.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.439
I don't disagree,
and neither does my chiropractor.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.909
But, you know, with the death
of Marissa's friend...

07:18.080 --> 07:20.640
...and Summer being left
motherless for the second time...

07:20.800 --> 07:23.394
...we just don't wanna make
any unnecessary waves.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.239
- Hello?
- Good morning, gorgeous.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.391
- How'd you sleep?
- All by my Ionesome.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.073
We've gotta to do something
about that.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.032
Just found a note from Summer.
I think she's getting suspicious.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.031
<i>I hate keeping secrets from the kids.</i>

07:43.200 --> 07:45.430
Yes, well, maybe we should
discuss that.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.670
- Covertly, of course.
<i>- How about tomorrow night?</i>

07:47.840 --> 07:49.239
I know the perfect hideaway.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.595
Well, I like the sound of that.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.671
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.635
Oh, Kiks, I'm so tired.
I could really use a quick catnap.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.631
Wake me in 20.

08:08.920 --> 08:13.311
Well, I pulled the permits.
Unfortunately, I think I left them at...

08:13.480 --> 08:16.233
Scratch that. I'll fax them from here.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.675
You need to start tying
a string around your finger.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.114
Do I?

08:20.280 --> 08:23.078
Yesterday it was your wallet,
Monday it was your BlackBerry.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.356
Well, I find you very distracting
in the morning.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.592
And in the afternoon, late at night.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.591
Does that mean
you're coming over tonight?

08:30.760 --> 08:34.070
Matt, we are way out of time
with the hospital. You've gotta talk to...

08:34.240 --> 08:38.073
- Maya. What a nice surprise.
- Morning, Sandy. You're looking well.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.356
You too. I'm sorry to interrupt.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.590
- Buzz me when you're free.
- Oh, he's free now.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.069
Nobody respects company time
like a company girl.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.390
- Thank you for...
- Yeah, I'll have my assistant...

08:47.560 --> 08:49.596
...pick up some string
for those fingers.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.558
- Say hello to Kirsten for me.
- You bet.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.119
Already the early office drop-in.
You two are hitting it off.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.669
- Yeah. She is really great.
- I'm glad to hear it.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.957
If we don't get that proposal
to Dr. Griffin and the board by Monday...

09:04.120 --> 09:05.997
...we're dead in the water.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.434
Yeah, I know.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.511
But the way things are
between Maya and I...

09:09.680 --> 09:12.319
...I just can't ask her
to get us a meeting with her dad.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.357
I don't do this right,
it could backfire.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.273
You need to come through.
The clock is ticking.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.359
Yeah, can you just tell him
that his daughter called again?

09:25.520 --> 09:28.478
Thanks. Oy.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.950
- As in "vey"?
- Attagirl.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.678
Apparently my dad's
in "surgery" all day.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.991
How many calf implants does it take
to fill a hole in the human heart?

09:37.160 --> 09:39.435
- Hi, friends.
- Hey.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.079
So, what are we talking about?

09:41.240 --> 09:44.152
Summer's worried her dad's burying
his pain and Ioneliness in work.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.351
- That's so sad.
- Yeah.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.158
What's the plan?

09:51.200 --> 09:53.350
- You guys don't have a plan?
- Do you?

09:53.560 --> 09:54.959
Off the top of my head?

09:55.120 --> 09:58.476
Get him into therapy to explore the root
of why he can't express himself...

09:58.640 --> 09:59.914
...in a lasting partnership.

10:00.080 --> 10:04.392
Or, find him a hot date,
take his mind off being utterly alone.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.355
Does he still have the things
on his thing?

10:07.520 --> 10:09.875
- A little penicillin cleared that right up.
- Great.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.917
It looks fantastic.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.637
Good. That's good.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.156
You know, I would offer up my mom,
but she's not a big second-chancer.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.118
What about getting Seth's mom
to take your dad as a client?

10:22.880 --> 10:24.916
- That's not a bad idea.
- But the last person...

10:25.080 --> 10:27.878
...that should be choosing my dad's
next great love is my dad.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.314
But me, on the other hand...

10:29.480 --> 10:32.358
...I can make a list of all the stuff
he should be looking for...

10:32.520 --> 10:34.875
...and pick the girl myself.
- That's good.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.156
I'll start brainstorming ideas
for fun things...

10:37.320 --> 10:39.470
...for old people to do on a first date.

10:42.720 --> 10:43.994
I've been trying to find you.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.151
Police talk to you?

10:46.320 --> 10:49.551
Yeah, they call you too? They must
wanna talk to everyone who was there.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.757
No. Actually, Sadie said
they only asked her about you.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.319
Me?

10:54.480 --> 10:56.516
Yeah. You want me to go with you?

10:56.680 --> 10:57.954
No. No, it's okay.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.156
Whatever it is, I don't wanna
drag you into it.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.833
- Look, I'm...
- So how's it...?

11:04.840 --> 11:06.876
Look, I know I haven't
been around much lately.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.270
It's okay. You're helping Gwen.
That's important.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.829
Yeah, actually I need to go
over there after school...

11:12.000 --> 11:13.797
...but maybe we could
get together later?

11:13.960 --> 11:15.234
- Talk.
- Yeah, of course.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.153
I'll call you. Tell Sadie I say hi.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.713
You know, you might wanna see Sandy
about the police.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.399
I'm sure it's nothing. Thanks.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.112
Hey.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.034
So I figured we'd start
by patching up the wall.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.589
Which is really more fun
than it sounds.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.398
No, it's not.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.028
No, it's not.
You look like you're on a mission.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.474
That's because I am.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.790
- Everything okay?
- It will be.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.520
Once I get done smacking
that stupid bastard around.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.716
- Oh, who's getting smacked around?
- My uncle.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.599
- Johnny's dad?
- lf you wanna call him that.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.558
The patching will have to wait
until after I get back from Brea.

11:55.720 --> 11:56.994
Yeah. Sure. You want a ride?

11:57.160 --> 11:59.469
- I've got a car.
- You're gonna need some company.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.314
I kind of already have some.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.358
- Hey, what's up. You ready to roll?
- What is this guy doing here?

12:06.040 --> 12:09.157
That's funny because I was about
to ask her the same thing about you.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.437
- You've always been kind of slow.
- But I'm quick at kicking your ass.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.953
Running away is more
how I remember it.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.394
Really? Well...

12:15.560 --> 12:18.757
...I'd love to jump back in the ring.
- Too much testosterone.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.354
Volchok's dad used to be
buddies with Jack Harper.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.318
- He knows where we can find him.
- He can give us the address.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.553
Well, I'm kind of looking forward
to a road trip.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.950
- You know, catching up?
- We'll send you a postcard.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.599
Ryan, don't.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.831
Why don't you just
write down the address?

12:44.560 --> 12:47.791
Whatever. Any chance to avoid
Johnny's dad sounds good to me.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.950
- I hate that guy.
- Thanks. I'll send him your best.

12:52.120 --> 12:56.398
So if you're gonna be with her, does that
mean your girlfriend's all alone?

12:59.120 --> 13:01.350
What goes around comes around.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.871
Wanna tell me the deal
with you and Volchok?

13:22.040 --> 13:23.678
I was visiting Johnny one summer.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.559
And I was younger. Stupid.
It didn't work out.

13:26.720 --> 13:27.994
Hard to believe.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.991
You wanna take the 5
to the 57?

13:30.160 --> 13:31.434
It's faster.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.149
Right, because you know so much
about driving inland.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.908
When was the last time
your parents' $80,000 SUV...

13:38.080 --> 13:39.672
...was east of South Coast Plaza?

13:39.840 --> 13:42.354
The Cohens are my guardians,
not my parents.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.078
Grew up in Chino. Dad's in prison.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.391
My mom couldn't make it work.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.718
I just knew there was something
about you that didn't quite fit in.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.398
In a good way.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.077
I wonder if your dad
knows my Uncle Jack.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.832
- Why would he?
- From prison.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.274
He's been in a couple times.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.396
I'd put him back if I could.
He owes my aunt years of child support.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.959
He's her last hope.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.076
Now she needs that money.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.720
- So you think you can turn him?
- lf I don't try, who will?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.039
What would you feel about dinner?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.431
Sure, whatever you feel like.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.068
Tomorrow night.
Me, you, Kirsten and Maya.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.798
Yeah, that sounds good.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.317
Have you been locked in your office
all day planning our social lives?

14:35.480 --> 14:37.277
Let me ask Maya about the proposal.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.194
- Sandy, I said I'd do it.
- No, it's better this way.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.272
I'll bring it up. It'll be easier.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.479
Marissa. Come on in.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.870
I went by the house.
Kirsten told me you were here.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.315
Oh, the door's always open, honey.
You remember Matt.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.593
I think I need some legal advice.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.990
The cops wanna talk to me
about Johnny.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.071
They don't seem to think
it was an accident.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.231
Did they suspect
Ryan's to blame for this?

15:03.400 --> 15:04.674
No, I actually think...

15:04.840 --> 15:06.558
...they're trying to blame me.
- You?

15:06.720 --> 15:09.188
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm supposed to be at the station...

15:09.360 --> 15:10.679
...giving them a statement.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.513
I'll call and get that rescheduled.
We'll do it at the house.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.319
If you don't mind,
I'd kind of like to keep Ryan out of this.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.432
Of course.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.716
- Feel free to use my place.
- Thanks, Matt.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.155
But before that,
we'll go over what you're gonna say.

15:23.320 --> 15:26.437
And you're gonna have to tell me
everything you know about Johnny...

15:26.600 --> 15:28.238
...and you and that night.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.034
Hey, Summer. I didn't know
you were joining us tonight.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.713
Seth just went to pick up dinner.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.314
Actually, I came to see you guys.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.357
Oh, is everything okay?

15:46.520 --> 15:48.112
Well, no, not really.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.592
It's my dad. He needs, like, serious
and immediate help with his love life.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.076
Really? What makes you say that?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.992
I've never seen him so miserable.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.516
He's barely ever at home.
He's either at work, which is so lame...

16:00.680 --> 16:02.193
...or at the gym,
which is weird.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.952
He's already dropped like 20 pounds.

16:04.120 --> 16:08.750
Well, maybe he's getting into shape
in case he meets that special someone.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.514
- Or maybe he's already met her.
- Oh, please don't say that.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.796
My dad has disastrous taste in women.

16:13.960 --> 16:17.236
If I don't step in, he'll wind up
with the first money-grubbing slutbag...

16:17.400 --> 16:19.914
...that gets into the back seat
of his Maserati.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.877
Julie, would you like to take this?

16:23.400 --> 16:25.755
Actually, all I need is,
like, a list of candidates...

16:25.920 --> 16:27.956
...because I did all the work myself.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.034
They're all blond.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.434
Sharon Stone in <i>Basic Instinct?</i>

16:35.600 --> 16:36.919
It's the look my dad goes for.

16:37.080 --> 16:41.551
And this is a list of non-negotiable
qualifications that she must possess.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.473
"Mental stability.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.552
Crossword enthusiast. Love horses."

16:47.960 --> 16:50.838
"Must have own money.
Plastic-surgery free. Fluent in Italian."

16:51.000 --> 16:52.911
This doesn't leave
much wiggle room, Summer.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.436
It's just that my dad didn't have much
in common with his first two wives...

16:56.600 --> 16:59.876
...and they left,
so it's just not fair to him or to me.

17:02.360 --> 17:06.353
- Okay, well, we'll see what we can do.
- Really?

17:06.520 --> 17:09.397
Thank you guys so much.
This means so much to me.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.632
I'm gonna go see if my dad's
actually coming home tonight.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.279
Bye.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.236
- What are you gonna do, Julie?
- I don't know.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.310
Is it possible I'm not enough
woman for him?

17:20.480 --> 17:22.277
Do I really need to be all these things?

17:22.440 --> 17:24.589
Julie, you're never gonna be
any of these things.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.632
Okay, blond, maybe.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.951
Fluent in Italian? Not so much.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.872
You have to tell Summer the truth.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.511
The guy really keeps up
on his yard work.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.752
Yeah, Uncle Jack
is a really good neighbor.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.238
Hi, we're looking for Jack Harper.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.913
But you're not him.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.433
He in some kind of trouble?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.511
No. No trouble.

17:50.680 --> 17:51.954
No. Good news, actually.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.315
Too bad. I fricking hate that guy.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.040
He owes someone money
and we're trying to collect.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.600
He moved to Indio. That's all I know.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.318
A phone number? Forwarding address?

18:02.480 --> 18:04.277
No one here was
looking to keep in touch.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.271
Okay. Thank you for your help.

18:06.440 --> 18:10.069
You find Jack Harper,
you won't be thanking me.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.470
So we're going to Indio.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.796
Ryan, Indio's like two hours
into the desert.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.235
We won't even be able
to start looking until morning.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.674
Yeah, so we spend the night.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.273
I think you might be missed.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.873
I will make some calls.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.069
- You don't have to do this.
- I want to.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.233
Good evening.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.752
Julie?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.319
<i>Buena sera,</i> doctor.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.510
What's a 13-letter word for secretive?

18:55.360 --> 18:57.510
Surreptitious.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.354
I don't think you can smoke here.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.474
Julie, what is all this?

19:06.640 --> 19:08.517
Oh, do you like it?

19:09.840 --> 19:11.637
Because tonight is all about you.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.839
I didn't know you do crosswords.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.998
No, Mom, they're out of bibimbap.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.991
Yes, all gone.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.798
How about bulgogi?

19:23.960 --> 19:25.234
Two orders?

19:29.200 --> 19:31.270
Mom, next time
let me call in the order.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.112
I know, that's why they call it
"Korean barbecue."

19:36.640 --> 19:38.710
Okay. Goodbye.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.957
So, what'll it be?

19:51.120 --> 19:53.156
Blond, Italian, philanthropist?

19:53.320 --> 19:54.673
I can be all of them.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.276
Tell me, in your wildest dreams, what
would you do with a willing woman?

19:58.440 --> 20:00.351
Okay.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.470
<i>So did you guys make plans</i>
<i>to talk or what?</i>

20:08.640 --> 20:11.712
Yeah. We agreed we'd talk,
we just didn't pick a time or a place.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.711
Coop, usually a time and place...

20:13.880 --> 20:16.758
...are crucial aspects to any plan.
- I know.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.911
You and Ryan
have been getting along okay.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.877
That's because
we haven't been talking.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.519
Just call him.

20:24.160 --> 20:27.789
- Do it.
- Fine. Bye.

20:41.360 --> 20:44.591
- You play poker?
- What's the pot?

20:45.640 --> 20:48.393
Well, I got like 20 bucks on me.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.231
That's not gonna do it.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.712
Then what?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.434
You ever play strip poker?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.431
Yes, I have played strip poker.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.192
I'm wearing more clothes
than you are, though.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.157
Yes, but I think
I'm a way better player.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.393
You think so?

21:06.080 --> 21:08.071
- Yeah. Just deal.
- Okay.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.914
Loser sleeps on the floor.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.911
Which basically means
you're on the floor.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.479
Sure, sure.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.278
Your bookie?

21:25.760 --> 21:27.432
No, just Seth.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.272
I'll call him in the morning.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.518
<i>Hey, it's Ryan. Leave a message.</i>

21:51.880 --> 21:54.075
- Room service.
- What's on the menu?

21:54.240 --> 21:57.550
Black coffee and jelly doughnuts,
courtesy of the Circle K.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.234
- Poolside service.
- I gotta remember this place.

22:00.400 --> 22:04.871
So I was flipping through
the yellow pages and I found this.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.474
- Think that's him?
- When we were kids, he was Big H...

22:09.640 --> 22:11.756
...and Johnny was Little H,
so it's gotta be.

22:11.920 --> 22:15.356
All right. I'm gonna shower,
wake myself up.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.476
I didn't actually sleep so well
last night.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.279
If you wanna sleep in the bed,
don't bluff with a pair.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.756
Did you call Seth back?

22:32.600 --> 22:36.149
- Dude, where are you?
- Indio. How much trouble am I in?

22:36.320 --> 22:38.595
Mom and Dad think
you're helping inner-city kids...

22:38.760 --> 22:40.318
...paint a overpass mural.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.994
I'm rolling around in your bed
so it looks slept in.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.038
- You'd do that anyway.
- So? How about a little gratitude?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.589
You're right, I owe you,
but it's for a good cause.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.830
You wanna clue me in on
what that cause is?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.719
Less you know, the better.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.599
Except the bed thing.
That's just creepy.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.189
- Seth, what are you doing?
- Ryan's painting a mural.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.590
- What are you doing?
- How did you get in?

23:10.760 --> 23:12.671
Never mind all that,
this is an emergency.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.957
Summer's gonna majorly wig when
she finds out who her dad is dating.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.270
Yeah, well, whoever it is,
staying out of it.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.113
Julie Cooper. I caught them
having an illicit liaison...

23:21.280 --> 23:23.635
...and the way they were talking
was perverted.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.474
Wait, perverted how?

23:25.760 --> 23:29.912
- Just what are we gonna tell Summer?
- What's who gonna tell Summer?

23:30.240 --> 23:33.073
- Do I need to call a locksmith?
- What are you doing here, T-bag?

23:33.400 --> 23:35.960
You know what, she's your girlfriend,
you should tell her.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.111
Oh, please, not you two again?

23:38.280 --> 23:41.431
Oh, no. No, no, no,
I'm totally over that weirdness. No.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.556
Your dad and Julie Cooper
are doing it.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.836
It's a shock. I wouldn't have
believed it myself...

23:46.000 --> 23:49.436
...if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
It was all very mid '90s, overwrought...

23:49.600 --> 23:53.718
...thriller, a sort of a Verhoeven shape.
- It's like a Sharon Stone movie.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.950
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, but hold on.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.998
This kind of broad reveal
requires independent confirmation.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.355
Fine. You can see for yourself.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.114
I happen to know
where their next tryst is going to be.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.840
Keep your eye on the ball and...

24:07.680 --> 24:09.352
...swing through it.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.954
Okay?

24:11.120 --> 24:13.190
Right? Your turn, come on.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.753
Neil, I am not very athletic.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.836
Spread your feet a little bit. Okay.
Let the grip rest gently in your hand.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.515
You keep your eye on the ball, and you're
gonna swing through the ball. Okay?

24:22.680 --> 24:24.955
- Raise the club gently...
- Now, if I break a nail...

24:25.120 --> 24:27.839
...your next fantasy better involve
a French manicure.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.592
Are we gonna do this now?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.398
- Look at the ball.
- Okay. Okay. Yes.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.516
There's no way.
This is my dad's sacred place.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.159
He would not bring a woman here.

24:37.320 --> 24:40.869
Maybe he doesn't think of Julie
as an actual woman, just a golf buddy.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.314
Who he makes out with.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.711
I cannot believe this.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.798
- Let's go.
- Okay.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.752
Let's go!

24:49.080 --> 24:50.877
- That's so horrible.
- I think they're cute.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.434
Jack Harper in?

25:01.600 --> 25:03.113
He's out on a job.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.317
- lf you need a bond, I can take care of it.
- No, we don't need a bond.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.754
We're looking for him.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.358
When do you expect him back?

25:10.840 --> 25:13.752
- Who wants to know?
- Well, his dead son, for starters.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.672
- Get out of here.
- We don't mind waiting.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.513
I got authority to protect
this property with lethal force.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.398
You know what that means?

25:25.560 --> 25:28.028
- Means we'll be out in the car.
- Yeah.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.869
<i>Hey, Marissa! Come up here!</i>
<i>You gotta see this view!</i>

25:42.040 --> 25:43.951
<i>Was your friend Johnny a big drinker?</i>

25:44.120 --> 25:45.792
- No.
- But he was drinking that night.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.155
- Any idea why?
- You're asking her to speculate.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.390
<i>Did anything happen</i>
<i>to Johnny that day?</i>

25:50.560 --> 25:53.870
<i>Anything that might've made him</i>
<i>want to drink? A fight with a friend...</i>

25:54.040 --> 25:55.553
<i>As bad as I wanna be with you.</i>

25:55.720 --> 25:59.030
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>And I think you love me too.</i>

26:03.240 --> 26:05.151
- Yes or no.
- Excuse me, detective...

26:05.320 --> 26:07.629
...we need a minute alone.
- " What we're doing here...

26:08.960 --> 26:13.078
<i>... isn 't only unfair to you, it's unfair to..."</i>
<i>This next part's burned here.</i>

26:13.240 --> 26:15.310
Ryan. To Ryan.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.311
<i>- I'm with you.</i>
<i>- But that's not the whole story, is it?</i>

26:17.480 --> 26:20.119
<i>Recovered from a fire pit</i>
<i>on the beach.</i>

26:20.280 --> 26:22.999
"I'm not in love with you,
and I never will be."

26:23.320 --> 26:25.390
May I see that?

26:25.920 --> 26:27.319
Come on, come up!

26:27.480 --> 26:29.516
<i>Seems like Johnny</i>
<i>took the news pretty hard.</i>

26:29.680 --> 26:32.911
<i>I can 't imagine that it made</i>
<i>your boyfriend very happy either.</i>

26:33.400 --> 26:35.470
Ryan didn't even know this existed.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.073
He has nothing to do with this.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.515
- Let him ask his question.
- No. I wanna tell him.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.399
Ryan didn't push him.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.120
<i>And Johnny didn 't commit suicide.</i>

26:44.280 --> 26:46.669
<i>If you really wanna know</i>
<i>what happened, he slipped.</i>

26:46.840 --> 26:48.956
<i>Johnny!</i>

27:05.200 --> 27:06.474
No, thanks.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.199
You know, Johnny and I
used to be friends.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.319
Yeah, he and Chili
used to follow me and the guys around...

27:15.480 --> 27:18.119
...trying to get us to teach them
how to surf.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.114
Yeah, well, what happened?

27:22.600 --> 27:24.318
He got better than me.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.879
And I didn't like that.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.271
Your secret's safe with me.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.271
- I should go.
- Look...

27:30.440 --> 27:34.672
...if you ever wanna kick it or hang out
or something, I'm around.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.831
- I'm not interested.
- You sure about that?

27:39.120 --> 27:40.394
I can keep a secret too.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.074
How did it go?

27:53.240 --> 27:55.356
Well, there were a few surprises.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.637
There doesn't seem to be evidence
pointing to suicide or foul play...

27:58.800 --> 28:02.429
...so if that's the case,
they'll have to rule it an accident.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.158
I'm glad.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.278
Honey, you look exhausted.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.476
Well, thank you.
You look beautiful, as always.

28:10.520 --> 28:13.557
I was up most of the night
finishing this hospital proposal.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.632
Maybe we should reschedule
with Matt and Maya for next weekend.

28:16.800 --> 28:19.837
Oh, I wish we could,
but it would defeat the whole purpose.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.389
- I thought the purpose was dinner.
- Well, dinner...

28:22.560 --> 28:25.438
...and Maya's our chance at
a second hearing at the hospital.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.558
The way they've been getting along,
I think he really likes her.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.676
I thought you abandoned
this idea weeks ago.

28:32.840 --> 28:36.674
Why would we abandon it?
She's not naive. She might wanna help.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.355
She might wanna rethink the relationship
if it doesn't go well. I know I would.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.351
Oh, honey, we're all adults here.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.318
And this project has the potential
to do an awful lot of good.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.517
Stakeouts are so much cooler
in movies.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.558
That's because they cut to the part
where the guy shows up.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.552
That's him. Come on.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.712
Jack Harper?

29:08.960 --> 29:11.030
- Who's asking?
- Friend of your son's.

29:11.320 --> 29:13.880
- I don't have a son.
- I know, Uncle Jack.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.837
That's why we're here.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.554
Sadie?

29:17.720 --> 29:19.472
Aunt Gwen says thanks for the card.

29:19.640 --> 29:22.837
- I didn't send her a card.
- You know what else you didn't send?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.036
Child support for
like the last three years.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.948
See, I needed that money
to start my business.

29:28.160 --> 29:31.038
Really? So is this truck
here a part of your business?

29:31.200 --> 29:32.792
Yeah, matter of fact it is.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.837
Oh, it's nice.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.037
You must be doing well, so you won't
mind paying her what you owe her.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.509
I don't owe that bitch anything.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.794
Sadie.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.471
Hey, you're joking, right?

29:53.560 --> 29:55.835
- Come here! Give me that!
- Get off her!

29:56.000 --> 29:57.877
Get off of her!

29:58.280 --> 29:59.554
Get off of me!

30:01.520 --> 30:04.592
- Let go of me! Let go!
- You know, this ain't high school, kid.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.955
Stop! Stop it! You let go of me!

30:07.320 --> 30:09.390
Ryan!

30:10.440 --> 30:13.557
Get off me. Get off. Get off me!

30:13.720 --> 30:17.235
Ryan! Let go. Ryan!

30:23.320 --> 30:26.437
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's not that bad.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.318
Except when you do that.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.995
No, I'm sorry
that I dragged you into this.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.436
Yeah. Well, if I remember,
you kind of begged me not to come.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.679
I just wish we got the money.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.876
What do you think Johnny's mom's
gonna do now?

30:41.040 --> 30:43.952
I don't know.
Jack was kind of her last chance.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.834
I bet it's kind of hard for you to imagine
Gwen married to a guy like that.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.071
Easier than you think.

30:52.240 --> 30:55.152
Turns out Johnny and I
kind of had a lot in common.

30:59.680 --> 31:00.954
You okay?

31:01.520 --> 31:03.238
I will be.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.556
First time I laid eyes on Matt
was at a tailgate party.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.994
He was doing a keg stand.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.913
I thought it was when
you rushed my house as a little sister.

31:35.080 --> 31:37.389
No. That's the first time you saw me.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.312
I was stalking you for months.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.710
I used to walk behind Kirsten
on her way home.

31:41.880 --> 31:46.032
She lived on the opposite side of
campus, but I lived to watch her walk.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.553
And I called campus security.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.632
Yeah, it was worth every minute
I was detained in questioning.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.394
Now, here we are.
I'm running Kirsten's father's company.

31:53.560 --> 31:57.678
Matt here has been working like a dog
on a proposal for your dad's hospital.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.876
Yeah. I wish that had worked out.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.594
We don't give up that easily.

32:02.760 --> 32:05.320
We were hoping you could help us
get one more shot.

32:05.480 --> 32:08.392
We've listened to what he had to say
and we reworked the proposal.

32:08.560 --> 32:12.030
You're a passionate man, Sandy,
I'll give you that.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.436
Why don't I take a look at it.
If I like what I see, I'll pass it along.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.956
- We'll set up a meeting for next week.
- Well, we can't wait that long.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.156
The board is moving forward
on Monday.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.071
- I see.
- Maya, it's not a big deal.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.549
- Don't worry about it.
- It really is that big a deal.

32:28.720 --> 32:32.508
You're our only chance. Sorry in advance
if this is too much pressure on you...

32:32.680 --> 32:34.557
...but this hospital could help
a lot of people.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.429
That's the only reason we're asking.
But we are asking. We need your help.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.672
Sandy, we're eating.
Can we at least wait until after dinner?

32:43.840 --> 32:46.434
Matt, do you want me to show
the proposal to my father too?

32:48.680 --> 32:50.033
Yeah, I would.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.832
Then I'd be happy to, Sandy.
Will you excuse me?

33:06.120 --> 33:07.712
She said she'd be happy to.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.919
Wait, but...

33:19.640 --> 33:21.710
- Wait, Seth.
- What?

33:21.880 --> 33:24.030
What if my dad actually falls for her?

33:24.200 --> 33:27.192
Would that be the worst?
You and Marissa are already like sisters.

33:27.360 --> 33:28.918
Why not make it official?

33:29.080 --> 33:32.152
No, but it's not about Marissa.
It's about what's right for my dad.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.276
And it's definitely not Julie Cooper.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.556
Okay, I mean, no offense,
but she's Julie Cooper.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.994
So what? I kind of like her.

33:38.160 --> 33:42.392
I don't care that she married my grandpa
for money or had sex with Luke.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.879
I think she's got moxie.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.439
Summer? You home?

33:45.600 --> 33:47.158
Gross, I'm studying. Get off me.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.551
- Hey, sir. How's it going?
- Hello, Seth.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.072
Dad. How was your day?

33:53.480 --> 33:55.436
One of the best on record, actually.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.273
Oh, really? Any particular reason?

33:58.440 --> 34:01.557
Well, I think for the first time
in a long time, I might be happy.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.598
Sweetheart, do you have plans
tomorrow? I'd like to talk to you...

34:04.760 --> 34:07.399
...about something.
- No, I'm free.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.471
Good. Then it's a date.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.679
Hey, Dad, Dad...

34:16.320 --> 34:18.197
Nothing. It can wait.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.112
Okay.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.433
Right now?

34:25.840 --> 34:28.956
- I'm proud of you.
- Well, you heard the man. He's happy.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.994
- Oh, no.
- I've got so many hormones.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.036
Oh, get off...

34:46.280 --> 34:49.351
- You must be dumber than you look.
- I just wanna talk.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.829
- I got nothing to say to you.
- Good, you can listen.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.877
Oh, man.

34:55.560 --> 34:59.314
My father did a lot of bad things. Drank,
beat on my mom, my brother and me.

34:59.480 --> 35:03.678
- That's a real sad story, kid.
- But the worst thing he ever did...

35:03.840 --> 35:06.991
...was go away.
Leave my mom with nothing.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.351
No money, we had no shot.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.954
Any chance we had at a better life...

35:14.080 --> 35:15.513
...it pretty much disappeared.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.353
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Make things right with Johnny.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.156
It's a little late for that now.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.117
I mean, it's not like Johnny
would ever even know.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.157
Maybe not...

35:27.120 --> 35:28.394
...but you will.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.836
Get him out of here.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.758
I don't ever wanna see you again.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.719
- What is this?
- It's a start.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.876
All right, talk to you soon.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.113
That was Matt.

36:10.280 --> 36:13.078
Maya loved the proposal,
said she's gonna give it to her father.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.912
Congratulations.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.718
And then she broke up with him.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.593
She's moving back to New York.

36:18.760 --> 36:22.116
They've known each other for years.
They could've had a future together.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.510
Aren't you taking this match-making
too seriously?

36:24.680 --> 36:26.113
She's moving because she wants to.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.998
You've done a complete 180.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.594
A few weeks ago,
you were uncomfortable about this.

36:32.280 --> 36:35.397
I'm still uncomfortable with this.
I'd rather be defending criminals.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.996
But this is what I do right now,
so I might as well try to succeed at it.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.631
So this is just another day
at the office.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.510
I wouldn't put it that way.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.591
Remember when I said
that I wasn't worried...

36:47.760 --> 36:50.274
...about Sandy Cohen
knowing where the line is?

36:50.960 --> 36:52.871
I'm officially worried.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.756
What are you gonna say
about your face?

37:52.920 --> 37:54.956
Sandy and Kirsten are used to it.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.638
And Marissa?

38:01.040 --> 38:03.429
You know,
when you mentioned this trip...

38:04.200 --> 38:06.270
...I really wanted to come with you.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.789
I didn't even care
what you were doing...

38:10.440 --> 38:12.908
...I needed to get out of town.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.551
Feel something different.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.951
Yeah, this was definitely different.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.597
Now that you're back?

38:27.600 --> 38:29.591
Marissa and I need to talk.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.989
- Hey.
- Hey. How was your weekend?

38:45.160 --> 38:47.071
I've had better.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.399
<i>Everything okay with the police?</i>

38:49.560 --> 38:50.834
Sandy seems to think so.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.953
I called you yesterday.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.159
I know.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.991
- This is hard.
- You don't have to say it.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.835
No, I do. It's not because of Johnny
or Trey or anything else.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.672
- No, I know.
- It's just...

39:08.840 --> 39:10.910
Not working.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.510
Hard to believe after everything
we've been through...

39:18.680 --> 39:20.671
...we've got nothing left to say.

39:21.640 --> 39:24.074
We never were that good
with words anyway.

39:25.200 --> 39:28.431
- I guess, well, I'll see you at school.
- Yeah.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.158
See you.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.554
Hi.

39:58.760 --> 40:01.877
So I was unpacking the car,
and I was just thinking...

40:03.560 --> 40:05.152
Any chance you're up for a rematch?

40:07.280 --> 40:08.838
- Deal.
- Okay.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.433
Okay.

40:18.760 --> 40:20.113
Thanks.
