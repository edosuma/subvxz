WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.040
This pod is falling apart.

00:05.131 --> 00:07.213
It's all I can do to keep
her afloat. Chiana?

00:07.300 --> 00:08.665
It's not my fault, Crichton.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.920
I looked away for a microt and
Jool grabbed the controls.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.843
I didn't say it was your fault.
Give me status.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.010
It's not holding!

00:14.098 --> 00:15.429
Oh, you're getting mank
everywhere.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.632
Shut the frelll
This is your fault!

00:20.354 --> 00:24.347
Jool:
Look, there's Moya.
Let's just... -Pilot, Aeryn, come in.

00:25.318 --> 00:26.774
Pilot?

00:26.861 --> 00:28.226
That's not Moya.

00:31.616 --> 00:33.231
D'Argo:
That's a Leviathan with
a control collar.

00:33.326 --> 00:34.361
That means Peacekeepers.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.738
0-2 level's falling.

00:36.829 --> 00:40.413
Chiana:
Telemetry. Comms. Neuro-status.
We got nothing.

00:40.499 --> 00:44.162
( explosion )

00:44.253 --> 00:47.711
All right, we're heading for
that ship. That's it.
-John, that is not an option!

00:47.798 --> 00:50.835
We don't have any options,
unless you want to die out here
in the middle of nowhere.

00:50.927 --> 00:53.794
It's better than being
captured, tortured and killed
by the Peacekeepers.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.344
Do you hear that noise?
That's our air!

00:55.431 --> 00:57.513
D'Argo:
We have no comms.
We have no idea who

00:57.600 --> 00:59.306
or what is on that ship.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.884
You are leading us to our death.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.859
(clanging, hissing)

01:14.575 --> 01:16.611
All right, that's it.
Everybody out!

01:17.453 --> 01:18.693
Out!

01:20.456 --> 01:22.037
(grunts)

01:31.425 --> 01:33.586
Chiana:
What happened here?

01:39.141 --> 01:40.802
(distant howling)

01:40.893 --> 01:43.600
That smell.

01:43.688 --> 01:46.350
If there were Peacekeepers,
they'd be here by now.

01:51.070 --> 01:54.107
Well, this section's airlocked,
so someone wants us here.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.654
( sniffs )

02:13.801 --> 02:15.132
(creature shrieking )

02:15.219 --> 02:16.800
D'Argo!

02:17.471 --> 02:19.427
( screams )

02:20.349 --> 02:22.931
Crichton:
What the hell's going
on out here?

02:26.230 --> 02:28.221
D'Argo:
I told you we shouldn't
have come here.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.026
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

02:42.121 --> 02:45.830
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

02:45.916 --> 02:47.247
I'm trying to stay alive...

02:47.335 --> 02:49.246
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

02:49.337 --> 02:52.295
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.837
If you can hear me...
Beware.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.915
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

02:56.010 --> 02:58.717
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

02:58.804 --> 03:03.173
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless, for the nightmares
I've seen.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.349
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

03:05.436 --> 03:08.143
Not show them...
You exist...

03:08.230 --> 03:11.973
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.676
It's gone.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.632
Burnt, battered, busted.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.139
Ding dong, the Pod is dead.

03:49.230 --> 03:53.018
It can't be dead, Crichton. You
have to fix it and you have to
get us out of here.

03:53.109 --> 03:56.101
Ain't gonna happen. Not unless
we can replace that stuff.

03:56.195 --> 03:59.153
D'Argo:
We need threekay wire
and narium coils.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.231
All right, we find it,
we might stand a chance

04:01.325 --> 04:05.534
and that means a scavenger hunt
in that direction.

04:05.621 --> 04:08.033
Jool:
Look, can't we just borrow one
of their Transport Pods?

04:08.124 --> 04:10.706
Chiana:
There aren't any.
I already looked.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.954
No Transport Pods.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.878
Not a single piece of
escape craft.

04:15.965 --> 04:19.332
It's like everybody who
could leave, has left.

04:20.553 --> 04:23.295
This place is bad voojo.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.596
Crichton:
It's a Leviathan like Moya.

04:25.683 --> 04:28.299
So spare parts, this way.

04:28.394 --> 04:31.261
I'm getting back in the
Transport Pod and I'm
staying there.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.344
Thank frek.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.555
No, you stay with her, Chiana.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.014
No way.

04:35.109 --> 04:38.693
Pip, Transport's all we got.

04:38.779 --> 04:43.944
Oh. I'm warning you, I'm going
to end up killing that
redheaded tralk.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.990
Whatever. Go on.

04:46.871 --> 04:49.078
Spare parts.

04:49.165 --> 04:50.746
That way. Let's find 'em.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.414
Frell.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.999
Trashed.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.880
Mmm.

05:03.971 --> 05:09.341
And there's no threekay wire
and definitely no narium coils.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.851
Anybody home?

05:14.273 --> 05:16.184
Anybody out there?

05:16.275 --> 05:19.642
(pounding, grunting)

05:19.737 --> 05:23.104
Do you wanna give me a hand
here? It's jammed.

05:23.199 --> 05:26.407
Or maybe there's a Pilot
keeping it shut.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.405
(rumbling)

05:32.082 --> 05:34.573
Or a host of Peacekeepers

05:34.668 --> 05:39.207
or thousands of feral hippie
boy's friends and relatives.

05:39.298 --> 05:42.005
It's a bit late to worry
about that.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.253
Let's just get what we need
for the Transport Pod

05:44.345 --> 05:46.802
and get the frell out of here.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.427
D'Argo!

05:50.518 --> 05:51.758
Chiana!

05:51.852 --> 05:53.308
Chiana!

05:54.563 --> 05:56.269
Chiana?

05:56.357 --> 05:57.517
The comms are down.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.688
Chiana!

05:58.776 --> 06:00.732
Could be the control collar.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.111
All right, we know the
layout, right?

06:05.199 --> 06:09.033
Okay, narium coils, threekay
wire, got to be on Tiers
Three and Four.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.405
Either that, or we head
straight for Pilot.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.867
Crichton...

06:13.958 --> 06:15.698
What you got, bigum?

06:15.793 --> 06:17.579
Bones.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.877
Sebacean bones, maybe.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.379
All right.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.047
D'Argo:
This way.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.133
Abbott and Costello in
The House of Horror.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.139
You know, we should talk
to the Pilot.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.892
He could tell us where to find
all the stuff we need.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.392
Ah, Crichton.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.604
ln here.

06:46.699 --> 06:49.190
Whoa! Oh, man, that smells
worse than Rygel.

06:49.285 --> 06:52.152
Well, almost. Get in.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.579
Crichton:
Yep, threekay wire. Good call.
How'd you know?

06:55.666 --> 06:57.281
It's a wild guess.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.163
This duct leads to the
klestron filters.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.836
We'll have to scrape
out what we can.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.459
( sloshing )

07:05.968 --> 07:08.175
Ho! Oh, man, that's pus!

07:08.262 --> 07:10.628
The ship is oozing pus, man.

07:10.723 --> 07:12.964
Yeah, this whole ship
is diseased.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.344
Oh, geez. No DRDs.
What's that about?

07:15.436 --> 07:18.143
It's like she got hit by some
kind of biochemical weapon.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.473
Narium coils, tier seven.

07:22.568 --> 07:25.150
Uh-uh. We got to find
the Pilot.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.228
Crichton, we get what we
need and we get out.

07:27.323 --> 07:30.565
What we need is the guy who
controls the Maintenance
Bay doors,

07:30.659 --> 07:32.399
the hangars, the whole
damn ship in fact.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.827
This was meant to be a
hit-and-run mission so we get
the parts that we need.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.324
And what if we're dying?

07:37.416 --> 07:39.372
What if we've been exposed to
some radiation or some virus

07:39.460 --> 07:41.872
that's gonna mutate us into the
Night of the Living Dead?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.418
Then the sooner we get
out of here, the better.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.336
If you want to go all
the way to Pilot...
-Hey, you know what...

07:45.424 --> 07:47.289
then you're tinked!
-we don't know what we're
dealing with, here.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.295
This is a Peacekeeper
prison ship.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.468
That's all you need to know.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.093
I'm going to go find the Pilot.
You get the junk.

08:02.775 --> 08:04.311
What was that?

08:04.401 --> 08:05.777
Uh...

08:07.404 --> 08:09.235
(sighs)

08:11.408 --> 08:13.273
External gyro-sensor.

08:13.369 --> 08:14.950
You broke it.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.573
I did not! ltjust fell.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.494
I don't believe this.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.117
What? Where are you going?

08:19.208 --> 08:20.118
Join the treasure hunt.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.325
Well, Crichton said
to stay here.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.034
Yeah, well he didn't
know about this.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.290
Well, you can't leave me.

08:26.382 --> 08:27.747
The comms are down.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.208
There's a... there's a pulse
rifle on the Transport Pod.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.006
How do | open this door?

08:34.098 --> 08:35.588
You know, we don't have
weapons on our planet.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.264
We don't have violence.
We don't have war...

08:37.351 --> 08:38.682
(grunts)

08:39.687 --> 08:41.302
What the frell?

08:45.234 --> 08:48.317
Oh frelling hezmana!

08:48.404 --> 08:49.564
See?

08:49.655 --> 08:51.065
Violence.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.147
You'll get the hang of it.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.778
(whimpers )

09:01.917 --> 09:04.408
(distant moaning)

09:08.132 --> 09:10.293
Good luck with the pulse rifle.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.216
I hope you're a fast learner.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.214
(whimpering)

09:18.392 --> 09:19.882
(door thumps shut)

09:24.356 --> 09:26.813
(distant clamoring )

10:10.360 --> 10:13.102
(feral grunts and squeals)

10:18.243 --> 10:19.904
Crichton:
What the hell?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.921
(terrified groaning )

10:36.845 --> 10:39.507
(groaning continues)

10:40.390 --> 10:42.597
Holy mother of God.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.260
( panicked screaming )
-Easy.

10:50.234 --> 10:52.350
(screaming continues)

10:53.237 --> 10:55.273
I'm not going to hurt you.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.320
(groans subside)

11:00.160 --> 11:02.537
My name is Crichton.

11:02.621 --> 11:06.159
| live on a Leviathan.
We have a pilot. He's...

11:07.042 --> 11:08.953
kinda like you.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.916
What happened to you?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.089
Please...

11:16.176 --> 11:18.292
kill me.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.307
Come on...

11:30.357 --> 11:32.313
Come out and play.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.897
( screeching )

11:39.408 --> 11:41.524
(feral groaning)

11:43.954 --> 11:45.319
Don't mind me, just...

11:45.414 --> 11:47.029
just talk amongst yourselves.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.079
(grunting)

11:48.166 --> 11:49.372
( screams )

11:50.252 --> 11:51.788
Especially you.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.668
(growling)

12:03.348 --> 12:04.383
Stay back.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.884
Stay back!

12:07.269 --> 12:10.432
What about your comms?
Atmosphere? The doors?

12:10.522 --> 12:12.228
Can you control any of that?

12:12.316 --> 12:16.184
My neural pods slashed.
Please kill me.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.360
Look, your arms are going
to regenerate.

12:18.447 --> 12:21.154
Growgan. Cut urr!

12:21.241 --> 12:23.106
Grogan? Who the hell is Grogan?

12:23.201 --> 12:25.237
Growgan... Growgan cut!

12:25.329 --> 12:26.819
Growgan cut!

12:26.914 --> 12:28.620
(groaning)

12:28.707 --> 12:32.199
They cut your arms?

12:32.294 --> 12:35.286
And when they grow back,
they hack 'em off again?

12:36.548 --> 12:38.709
Why the hell would
they do that?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.301
Because, because...

12:40.385 --> 12:44.754
because they're eating me!

12:44.848 --> 12:46.349
(Chiana screaming)

12:47.434 --> 12:49.265
Stay back...

12:49.353 --> 12:51.218
Stay back!

12:56.234 --> 12:57.895
ldon't want to hurt you.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.314
Frell!

13:06.662 --> 13:08.573
(screaming in pain)

13:09.706 --> 13:12.573
D'Argo! Crichton!

13:14.002 --> 13:15.333
Frell.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.705
You want lunch?

13:16.797 --> 13:18.333
How about her?

13:24.262 --> 13:26.344
Chiana ( echoing ):
D'Argo!

13:27.432 --> 13:28.933
( echoing ):
Crichton!

13:29.017 --> 13:30.006
Chiana!

13:30.102 --> 13:31.012
( distant rifle fire )

13:31.103 --> 13:33.594
Chiana!

13:34.314 --> 13:36.726
(firing continues)

13:44.866 --> 13:46.857
(yelling)

13:46.952 --> 13:50.069
(war whooping)

13:50.622 --> 13:52.408
Chiana!

13:59.047 --> 14:01.163
Who are you?

14:01.258 --> 14:04.125
Where's Chiana? The Nebari?

14:04.219 --> 14:05.925
Stay back!

14:06.847 --> 14:10.339
Stay back or I swear
I will kill you.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.766
I don't think that's
very polite.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.788
No!

14:39.629 --> 14:41.165
Crichton!

14:42.382 --> 14:43.758
( screeching )

15:00.817 --> 15:03.308
(drill whirring)

15:15.373 --> 15:16.954
Ah...

15:28.095 --> 15:29.505
No!

15:35.268 --> 15:37.350
(screaming continues)

15:40.816 --> 15:42.306
(screaming stops )

16:25.277 --> 16:26.483
Pilot, what's going on?

16:26.570 --> 16:30.563
Starburst without any warning?
For yotz sake!

16:30.657 --> 16:32.818
But we've left Crichton and
the others stranded.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.321
Votched up all my second lunch.

16:35.412 --> 16:36.618
(coughing)

16:37.998 --> 16:39.613
Aeryn:
lt better be something
good, Pilot.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.871
Pilot:
Moya was responding
to a distress call.

16:42.961 --> 16:46.044
Perhaps you can see
for yourself.

16:46.631 --> 16:47.882
(groaning)

16:47.966 --> 16:49.422
Talyn.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.761
Crais, come in.
This is Aeryn.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.973
Crais?

17:03.231 --> 17:05.062
Pilot, there's no answer
from Crais.

17:05.150 --> 17:09.234
Nor is Moya getting any
answer from Talyn.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.579
( instrument beeping)

17:25.670 --> 17:28.127
What happened to you?

17:28.215 --> 17:30.376
Aeryn, what can you see?

17:31.885 --> 17:34.126
He's been hit hard.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.388
Pilot, any other ships
in the area?

17:38.475 --> 17:40.306
Not that I can tell.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.273
Crais?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.651
Crais.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.949
(grunting)

18:04.042 --> 18:06.533
Chiana:
We have... we have to give
him the death rites.

18:06.628 --> 18:07.959
Yeah.
-We have to give him...

18:08.046 --> 18:11.254
I'm sure there's a bunch of
Oricans around here.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.672
Damn it! We should've
stuck together.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.795
I wanted us to stick
together but he...

18:14.886 --> 18:18.754
we... both of us, were too
damned stubborn.
-No, no, no, it's not yourfault.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.304
Chiana, D'Argo is dead.

18:20.392 --> 18:23.134
Jool's God knows where, and
we have been here before.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.684
No, we haven't...

18:27.524 --> 18:29.355
(eating sounds)

18:32.570 --> 18:34.606
They're eating the ship.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.654
Crichton:
This is a Leviathan.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.402
It's like Moya.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.404
It's alive.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.371
( screams )

18:46.042 --> 18:47.373
( screams )

18:53.174 --> 18:56.132
We have to get out of here.
We have to... we have to
get out of here.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.629
Yes, we do.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.796
(groaning)

19:02.392 --> 19:04.098
(distant groaning)

19:04.853 --> 19:08.186
Okay, okay. I can do this.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.434
I can, I can do anything.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.641
That's what my father told me.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.227
That's what my mother told me.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.357
And I've never doubted
them before...

19:16.448 --> 19:18.564
(groaning)
(shrieks)

19:24.706 --> 19:26.992
(whimpering):
Maybe once or twice.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.250
But I shouldn't doubt them.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.753
I should believe in them.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.717
And I should...
believe in myself!

19:39.804 --> 19:41.840
( groaning )
( screaming )

19:43.850 --> 19:46.717
Oh, I don't think this is right.
lshouldn't be here.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.891
I'm a civilized being.

19:51.232 --> 19:55.316
There's got to be someone here
who recognizes that.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.394
ljust need to find them.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.909
Hello?

20:15.673 --> 20:17.334
Hello?

20:22.305 --> 20:24.421
(rumbling)

20:27.102 --> 20:29.218
(howling)

20:45.412 --> 20:47.118
(groaning)

20:48.289 --> 20:50.200
Pilot?

20:50.291 --> 20:52.282
He's disarmed.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.422
Yeah.

20:56.506 --> 20:59.873
All right, Pilot.
Nariam coils, where are they?

20:59.968 --> 21:01.424
(Pilot gasping)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.344
l... I, you know, I get it.
I come forward, you scream.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.342
I move back et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.515
Pilot, I'm over.
You're gonna help me.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.308
You're gonna give me something
and you're going to give
it to me now!

21:11.396 --> 21:13.387
(speaking alien language)

21:13.481 --> 21:16.439
Talk to me. Slowly.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.943
This... ship...

21:20.029 --> 21:24.238
Rovhu... was... was...

21:24.325 --> 21:25.280
( growls )

21:25.368 --> 21:27.233
(speaking alien language)

21:27.328 --> 21:29.535
Slowly.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.489
Detention ship... prison ship.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.199
Ship for...

21:34.294 --> 21:38.287
for the... krishool.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.712
What the hell is that?

21:39.799 --> 21:41.664
The criminally insane.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.886
The criminally insane.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.716
We fix the Transport Pod,
we get outta here.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.552
We got threekay wire.
It's a start at least.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.978
He controls the whole
ship, Chiana!

21:56.065 --> 21:58.681
He's got the Maintenance Bay,
he's got the doors,

21:58.776 --> 22:01.358
he's got the windows, he's got
the smoke on the water.

22:01.446 --> 22:03.232
I don't know what you're
talking about.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.063
The guy! Whatever, whoever.

22:05.158 --> 22:08.241
The one that killed D'Argo.
Doctor Spike.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.865
Kaarvok. Kaarvok. Spike.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.286
Kaarvok. That's his name?

22:12.373 --> 22:16.662
Bring Kaarvok.
Ah, bring him back.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.119
(groaning)

22:19.214 --> 22:23.503
What's a PK prison convoy doing
way out here in the Uncharted
Territories?

22:24.719 --> 22:27.506
Peacekeeper convoy...

22:27.597 --> 22:29.212
Ambushed convoy.

22:29.307 --> 22:30.638
Scarrans ambushed.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.307
We drifting.

22:33.394 --> 22:36.557
Ah, not to Starburst...
not to go.

22:36.648 --> 22:38.639
Nowhere to go...

22:38.733 --> 22:41.315
No one helps.

22:41.402 --> 22:44.986
We... starve.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.485
What's the big fuss?

22:47.575 --> 22:50.032
Why the red carpet treatment?

22:50.119 --> 22:53.282
His power...

22:53.373 --> 22:55.204
And the others.
The other prisoners.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.327
What's their deal?

22:57.418 --> 23:01.661
There were no other prisoners.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.423
Chiana?

23:10.932 --> 23:12.422
Chiana.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.350
They'll never get to him now.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.397
Never, ever.

24:02.859 --> 24:05.350
( instrument beeping)

24:10.491 --> 24:14.200
They had a whole prison ship
for one prisoner?

24:14.287 --> 24:16.778
What about all this other
vermin we're seeing?

24:16.873 --> 24:18.704
The hungry, hungry hippies?

24:19.417 --> 24:21.408
Peacekeepers.

24:22.337 --> 24:23.417
Peacekeepers?

24:23.504 --> 24:27.167
They were Peacekeepers,
all of them.

24:28.426 --> 24:29.290
(wind sucking)

24:29.385 --> 24:31.250
Whoa!

24:31.346 --> 24:32.335
(screaming):
Pilot!

24:32.430 --> 24:35.388
Pilot:
He's venting the chamber!

24:39.395 --> 24:43.138
I wish you wouldn't talk about
me behind my back.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.725
(shrieks)

24:53.326 --> 24:54.987
(whimpering)

24:59.916 --> 25:01.531
No... No!

25:01.626 --> 25:03.787
No! No!

25:05.505 --> 25:07.336
Help!

25:16.891 --> 25:18.392
No!

25:30.738 --> 25:32.649
(grunting)

25:36.327 --> 25:37.282
( screaming )

25:38.663 --> 25:40.619
( both screaming )

25:40.707 --> 25:41.617
Frell!

25:41.708 --> 25:42.447
Frell.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.453
( screaming )

25:50.842 --> 25:52.423
Help me.

25:54.679 --> 25:56.260
Help me!

26:05.022 --> 26:09.015
Rygel ( laughing ):
No, you are not taking
him back to Moya.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.064
He is still alive, Rygel.

26:13.156 --> 26:15.112
We can fix that.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.113
What are you...
Give me the transponder.

26:19.203 --> 26:22.161
The ship is shutting down.
Give it back.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.163
Rygel.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.117
Now!

26:27.211 --> 26:30.203
Oh, that's what we're
hoping for.

26:33.176 --> 26:35.838
Look, if you want to have
it out with Moya, you can
go right ahead.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.964
Listen, you bartantic bitch.

26:38.055 --> 26:42.389
Talyn's supposedly the meanest,
deadliest, all-time
yave-of—the-yuvo fighter ship.

26:42.477 --> 26:46.140
But somebody, something,
beat the yotz out of him.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.721
And when they come back
to finish him off,

26:48.816 --> 26:50.352
we'll be here with him,

26:50.443 --> 26:51.899
unarmed.

26:51.986 --> 26:54.352
And if we can keep him alive,
we might find out what happened.

26:54.447 --> 26:57.280
Oh, in another am or two
it won't matter.

26:57.366 --> 27:00.358
Let's go. While we still can.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.706
Chiana!

27:15.218 --> 27:18.210
Chiana!

27:23.184 --> 27:24.720
Chiana!

27:27.188 --> 27:28.894
(faint squeaking)

27:32.610 --> 27:33.816
Chiana!

27:33.903 --> 27:38.442
Let her go!

27:38.533 --> 27:40.273
(yelling)

27:40.368 --> 27:42.825
Chiana!

27:42.912 --> 27:45.369
Chiana!

27:45.456 --> 27:48.163
(yelling)

28:02.390 --> 28:03.880
Okay, okay.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.840
(whimpering)

28:06.727 --> 28:09.969
Come... come....

28:11.274 --> 28:13.310
Okay, okay.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.975
Two Chianas.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.357
(moans)

28:19.115 --> 28:20.696
Two...

28:20.783 --> 28:24.617
She... she... and I'm me.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.364
Yeah.

28:27.164 --> 28:28.244
l'm me.

28:28.332 --> 28:29.993
Mm-mm.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.700
She... she... she was
just a clone.

28:34.297 --> 28:36.754
A clone, so I'm...

28:37.258 --> 28:39.419
I'm the real me.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.256
I'm the real me.

28:47.518 --> 28:50.305
D'Argo's dead.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.270
Chiana's dead.

28:56.110 --> 28:57.611
Oh, yeah.

28:57.695 --> 28:59.185
Oh yeah, I can feel it.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.522
That sick Hammer Horror
son of a bitch,

29:02.617 --> 29:05.154
he's going to be sucking my
brains through a sippy straw,

29:05.244 --> 29:07.485
and it ain't making me
feel comfortable!

29:07.580 --> 29:12.665
Now see I head for the
Transport Pod and he runs me
down like a sick lizard

29:12.752 --> 29:15.243
or... we take back control.

29:15.338 --> 29:17.795
No.
-We patch your ass back in.

29:17.882 --> 29:19.588
No.
-We vent the chambers

29:19.675 --> 29:21.586
You can't.
-and suck his ass out
into space.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.633
No, no, no.
-Pilot, Pilot, Pilot.

29:23.721 --> 29:25.962
You listen to me.
We can do this.

29:26.057 --> 29:29.094
We find Jool, we take
back control.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.891
You and me, buddy.
Good things are gonna happen.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.388
Good things.

29:48.871 --> 29:50.953
( roars )

29:52.208 --> 29:54.039
Are you comfortable in there?

29:54.126 --> 29:55.866
( roars )

29:58.673 --> 30:02.291
Oh, do settle.
You're being very angry.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.342
What have you done to me?

30:08.432 --> 30:12.016
D'Argo, I saved you
from the Xarai.

30:12.103 --> 30:16.267
You know, they're
completely uncivilized.

30:16.357 --> 30:18.018
What have you done with Chiana?

30:18.109 --> 30:19.349
Chiana?

30:19.443 --> 30:20.649
The Nebari!

30:21.404 --> 30:23.190
The gray girl.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.486
Yes.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.155
Very, very, very, very nice.

30:27.243 --> 30:28.323
( growls )

30:28.411 --> 30:32.120
Really, very nice.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.616
Were you close?

30:33.708 --> 30:35.994
What have you done with her?

30:36.085 --> 30:37.916
I haven't done anything.

30:38.004 --> 30:41.713
Last I heard she was having her
best bits eaten by the Xarai.

30:41.799 --> 30:44.006
( growls )

30:44.093 --> 30:46.334
As I said, they're uncivilized.

30:46.429 --> 30:50.138
It's you I'm more
concerned about.

30:50.224 --> 30:52.590
What have you done with me?

30:52.685 --> 30:54.550
I saw...

30:54.645 --> 30:58.137
Yes? You saw?

30:58.232 --> 30:59.813
What did you see?

31:01.944 --> 31:04.435
Another D'Argo?

31:05.322 --> 31:07.062
You cloned me.

31:07.158 --> 31:09.695
Not the word clone, please.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.525
l doubled you.

31:14.248 --> 31:18.366
Two D'Argos,
equal and original.

31:19.170 --> 31:22.708
And tasty.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.790
I've never twinned
a Luxan before.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.250
Why me?

31:29.263 --> 31:31.720
We're going to make babies.

31:38.773 --> 31:40.434
Chiana in two.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.139
(gasps )

31:42.234 --> 31:43.770
Two... two of me?

31:43.861 --> 31:46.318
Two. Forked!

31:46.906 --> 31:48.316
He copies you.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.318
That's what he does.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.240
(giggles )

32:01.879 --> 32:03.335
Two Chianas.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.878
(giggles )

32:05.466 --> 32:08.082
Think. Think.

32:09.970 --> 32:13.804
Kaarvok must've found a way to
patch himself into Rovhu.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.552
Forced Control System.

32:15.643 --> 32:19.227
Installed security of
the Peacekeepers.

32:19.313 --> 32:21.349
Yeah, but she's still alive.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.522
Not conscious life.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.224
Tertiary life support.

32:25.319 --> 32:27.605
( screaming )

32:28.531 --> 32:29.646
You feel that?

32:29.740 --> 32:31.856
Its... uh...

32:31.951 --> 32:35.318
Crichton.
Can't work the console.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.403
I'm coming up.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.197
( growls )

32:40.292 --> 32:42.032
I can double you again.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.494
And again and again.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.294
Look at the Peacekeepers.

32:46.382 --> 32:47.872
What Peacekeepers?

32:47.967 --> 32:49.423
All overthe ship.

32:49.510 --> 32:51.375
The Xarai, I call them.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.676
Private joke.

32:52.763 --> 32:55.721
I once had a tame vangern
called Xarai.

32:55.808 --> 32:59.972
As you can see, once you've
been twinned 30 or 40 times,

33:00.062 --> 33:02.223
you're not much good
for conversation.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.602
Not that you're especially
witty right now.

33:05.693 --> 33:07.524
Hold still!

33:09.530 --> 33:12.363
(frightened whimpers )

33:12.449 --> 33:15.282
D'Argo:
I can help you get
off this ship.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.652
Why should I want to do that?

33:18.747 --> 33:20.658
Because this ship is dying.

33:20.749 --> 33:23.365
It's rotting to pieces
all around you.

33:24.295 --> 33:26.251
This is my home.

33:26.338 --> 33:30.957
All I need is more...
what, food?

33:31.051 --> 33:32.916
Family?

33:33.012 --> 33:35.219
Is there a difference?

33:36.557 --> 33:40.550
D'Argo, you know how
painful it is.

33:40.644 --> 33:44.182
I'm willing to spare you the
pain of a whole half cycle,

33:44.273 --> 33:48.232
as long as you breed for me.

33:48.319 --> 33:49.934
Breed?

33:50.654 --> 33:52.235
With what?

33:56.911 --> 34:00.324
D'Argo, meet Belima.

34:00.414 --> 34:02.245
(growling)

34:05.211 --> 34:06.872
I'm sorry, I...

34:06.962 --> 34:10.375
I think I twinned her
a little too often.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.297
(power surging)

34:25.564 --> 34:30.809
Rovhu has no power enough.
Takes time to charge.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.313
Still nothing.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.942
No, can't even...
lights... no use.

34:36.033 --> 34:38.194
Pilot, don't give up here.

34:38.285 --> 34:40.116
You're all I've got,
you understand that?

34:40.204 --> 34:42.195
I need you, big boy,
and you need me.

34:42.289 --> 34:43.620
Come on.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.994
Central pluxus cable.

34:49.088 --> 34:52.205
Central... pluxus cable.

35:00.307 --> 35:04.596
Pilot ( screaming ):
Crichton!

35:06.355 --> 35:08.471
No!

35:22.454 --> 35:25.662
Aeryn:
Quite simple, Rygel.
I'm taking the Pod and collecting the others.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.831
Take plenty of food with you.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.783
There'll be nothing here
when you return.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.129
I'll be back within the am.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.249
You're leaving us chained
to Talyn?

35:33.340 --> 35:35.296
Crawling along at hetch three.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.670
Towing him is the only way.

35:37.761 --> 35:38.671
Boll-yotz.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.627
We should be Starbursting.

35:40.723 --> 35:43.089
We can't Starburst.
You know we can't.

35:43.183 --> 35:44.719
We can.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.436
If you try anything when
I am gone,

35:49.523 --> 35:53.266
whatever you have in the
place of mivonks and
wherever they are,

35:53.360 --> 35:56.602
they will be gone
when I get back.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.410
We give her 300 microts.

36:05.497 --> 36:10.332
Then we cut ourselves free from
Talyn and we Starburst.

36:10.419 --> 36:12.375
Talyn will recover.

36:12.463 --> 36:15.671
Crais may not.

36:15.758 --> 36:19.717
I suspect that now is not the
right moment to abscond.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.428
( growls )

36:28.812 --> 36:30.348
(faint roaring)

36:30.439 --> 36:32.054
(gasps )

36:33.525 --> 36:36.312
(feral squeals)

36:40.282 --> 36:42.989
( shivering )

36:47.373 --> 36:50.206
(continuous feral grunts
and squeals )

36:56.256 --> 36:57.245
Come on, dammit, John.

36:57.341 --> 36:59.172
Remember the sequence.
You know the sequence.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.716
Remember the damn sequence.
You know what you're doing
here. Come on.

37:01.804 --> 37:04.796
(engine revving)

37:35.421 --> 37:39.380
Hey, Kaarvok! It's just
you and me now!

37:39.466 --> 37:41.752
What do you say we meet for
some coffee or something?

37:41.844 --> 37:45.587
I'm sure we've got lots of
stuff we could talk about.

37:45.681 --> 37:47.967
We'll cook you up something
special, K-man.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.639
It's gonna take
a little while.

37:49.726 --> 37:53.594
We're gonna hit you with
some Starburst Supreme!

37:59.069 --> 38:01.355
(faint groaning)

38:06.535 --> 38:08.275
(feral squeals)

38:10.414 --> 38:11.745
D'Argo!

38:11.832 --> 38:13.242
Ah...

38:13.333 --> 38:14.789
Um...

38:15.210 --> 38:16.916
Help me.

38:24.386 --> 38:27.378
Oh. Oh. Um...

38:27.473 --> 38:29.839
Chiana:
Are you sure I'm...
not interrupting something?

38:29.933 --> 38:31.434
Chiana, just hurry up.

38:31.518 --> 38:32.382
Ohh!

38:32.478 --> 38:33.888
Okay.

38:36.398 --> 38:39.014
Because you know, I... I could
just leave you there if...
if you want.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.144
It's... it's no trouble.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.271
No, no, no, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.772
Oh...

38:45.365 --> 38:47.026
Narium coils.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.493
(squealing)

38:48.577 --> 38:50.238
I'm coming.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.246
Okay.

38:58.795 --> 38:59.955
(sighs)

39:00.047 --> 39:01.878
Thank you.

39:01.965 --> 39:03.626
D'Argo:
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

39:03.717 --> 39:04.957
Chains.

39:05.052 --> 39:06.917
That's where l was aiming.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.133
(chattering )

39:10.224 --> 39:11.930
D'Argo:
Where's Crichton?

39:12.017 --> 39:15.259
I dunno. We got separated.
Maintenance Bay's this way.

39:15.354 --> 39:16.935
Where did you get separated?

39:17.022 --> 39:18.478
D'Argo, we got the stuff
we need, okay?

39:18.565 --> 39:21.432
We got threekay,
we-we-we got narium...

39:22.819 --> 39:24.195
Pilot's Den. Come on, this way.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.736
No, I'll go search for him.
You go back.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.688
No way. I'm not gonna split up.

39:28.784 --> 39:32.117
Chiana, go and get the
Transport Pod ready.

39:32.204 --> 39:35.037
Give me a quarter of an am
and I'll meet you there.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.997
Crichton:
Kaarvy!

39:41.088 --> 39:43.500
What's that I hear? Is that...

39:43.590 --> 39:45.455
Starburst?

39:45.551 --> 39:47.507
We can't Starburst.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.630
We're in a control collar.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.507
Oh, yes, we can Starburst.

39:51.598 --> 39:55.056
Just means this whole ship
is toast.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.429
Schmick light show, baby.

40:00.524 --> 40:03.436
You want to try that again?
Bring it on.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.397
( shivering )

40:09.283 --> 40:10.989
Okay.

40:13.287 --> 40:16.279
This is the best way.

40:16.373 --> 40:18.409
'Cause it's going to be quick.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.958
And it's gonna hurt a lot
less than being eaten.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.125
( rifle firing )

40:23.213 --> 40:27.297
( screaming )

40:27.384 --> 40:29.215
Still haven't learned
how to use it.

40:29.303 --> 40:33.797
I nearly shot myself
with a pulse rifle!

40:36.768 --> 40:38.383
What the frell?

40:40.397 --> 40:44.606
This ship won't Starburst.
It's not strong enough.

40:44.693 --> 40:47.605
Crichton:
Maybe she just needs
to recharge.

41:02.753 --> 41:04.414
ldon't think so, brain sucker.

41:04.504 --> 41:07.166
I can arrange my own death.

41:08.759 --> 41:10.215
Hurry up, Chiana.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.293
I'm going as fast as I can.

41:12.387 --> 41:13.547
Hurry!

41:15.182 --> 41:16.297
John!

41:16.391 --> 41:18.552
What the hell are you still
doing here, Kaarvey?

41:18.644 --> 41:20.600
Others will come.

41:20.687 --> 41:23.064
More and more of you will come.

41:23.148 --> 41:26.231
To me, my family,

41:26.318 --> 41:27.774
my farmland...

41:27.861 --> 41:30.694
my... my perfect...

41:30.781 --> 41:32.396
perfect dish.

41:33.659 --> 41:36.321
Crichtonll

41:37.371 --> 41:38.281
D'Argo.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.075
Crichton:
Hey, kids!

41:45.170 --> 41:47.126
It's dinnertime.

41:47.923 --> 41:50.505
And it's finger lickin' good!

41:57.265 --> 42:00.223
John! John, can you hear me?

42:00.894 --> 42:02.509
John!

42:02.604 --> 42:04.219
D'Argo!

42:05.148 --> 42:06.524
Are you okay?

42:06.608 --> 42:09.020
Yeah, we'll talk about it
later. Come on!

42:12.781 --> 42:13.770
Jool, you're alive!

42:13.865 --> 42:16.197
Well hurry up!
Chiana, let's go!

42:16.284 --> 42:17.820
Chiana!

42:20.122 --> 42:22.078
Crichton:
Hold the door!

42:23.083 --> 42:24.619
Jool, you're alive!

42:41.309 --> 42:42.765
Come on.

42:42.853 --> 42:45.094
Come on, you piece ofjunk.

43:07.502 --> 43:10.744
It was over in a flash.
No more than a tenth
of a microt.

43:10.839 --> 43:15.754
But I saw it. I saw... myself.

43:15.844 --> 43:17.004
Another me.

43:17.095 --> 43:18.926
Do you remember the
actual moment?

43:19.014 --> 43:22.598
No, I don't remember
anything except...

43:22.684 --> 43:24.140
it was a corpse.

43:24.227 --> 43:27.640
It was just a copy. A fake.

43:27.731 --> 43:30.473
I keep telling myself that,
but then this Crichton,

43:30.567 --> 43:34.310
and Kaarvok, he said he'd
created two equal and original.

43:34.404 --> 43:36.895
Boll-yotz! Kaarvok was
full of it.

43:36.990 --> 43:40.232
Then how do you know that
I am not the copy?

43:40.327 --> 43:42.318
Maybe the real D'Argo is dead.

43:42.412 --> 43:44.903
Because you just know!

43:45.916 --> 43:47.781
You know.

43:48.210 --> 43:50.246
Frell.

44:26.790 --> 44:28.906
Aeryn:
How is...

44:29.000 --> 44:30.615
he?

44:32.420 --> 44:35.253
Still tied.

44:45.684 --> 44:47.220
Kaarvok:
l doubled you.

44:47.310 --> 44:50.017
I twinned you.

44:50.105 --> 44:53.188
Equal and original.
