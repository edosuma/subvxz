01:24.200 --> 01:25.929
What's the matter, Mrs. James?

01:26.000 --> 01:29.641
You'd better have a good rest tonight.
It's these 12-hour shifts.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.768
I had some bad news this morning, miss.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.808
My Jim's missing.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.804
Oh, try not to worry.
I'm sure he'll turn up.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.803
Oh, I do hope so, miss.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.201
I expect I'll feel better
when I've had a cup of tea.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.204
That's right. It's finishing time now.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.891
<i>A million bullets
for dispatch by the morning?</i>

01:54.960 --> 01:57.930
<i>But, I tell you, the girls have done
ten hours today already.</i>

01:58.000 --> 01:59.684
<i>Yes, I realize how urgent it is.</i>

02:01.120 --> 02:03.600
<i>But you can't expect these girls to work
14 hours a stretch.</i>

02:05.120 --> 02:06.929
<i>All right, I'll ask them.</i>

02:07.000 --> 02:08.604
<i>She doesn't have to ask us.</i>

02:08.680 --> 02:11.081
<i>A million bullets by the morning.</i>

02:11.160 --> 02:13.367
<i>All right, come on, girls.
It's got to be done.</i>

02:30.080 --> 02:31.969
Stop. Stop there.
Stop the bus there.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.565
All right, can't go no further.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.926
Passengers for Bloomsbury,

02:35.000 --> 02:36.440
you're on foot from here.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.885
Thank you.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.485
- Mmm-hmm.
- This way, miss.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.691
"A million bullets by morning"?
No wonder the audience booed.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.728
- Or snored.
- We learn from our mistakes.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.929
I would have shot the writers,
not the picture.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.048
Authenticity, that's what we're after now.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.600
Authenticity informed by optimism.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.401
You think I don't understand
to give an audience optimism?

03:22.480 --> 03:24.801
I have three grandsons in the forces.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.770
Your company reputation
is founded primarily on comedy.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.606
The highest-grossing British picture
of the year was a comedy. Mine.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.126
And Mr. Buckley here wrote it.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.089
Yes, and very entertaining it was, too,

03:36.160 --> 03:40.449
but if we are to capture the public
imagination and their trust,

03:40.520 --> 03:45.287
we need more than fat policemen
toppling off ladders.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.170
We need a story to inspire a nation.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.369
Give me a real brief, Mr. Swain,

03:51.440 --> 03:56.651
and I swear, I will bring you
a picture to win the war.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.644
Or at least one to cheer us up
if we carry on losing it.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.922
So, please, tell us what it is you want.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.641
You have your brief, Mr. Baker.
Authenticity and optimism.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.320
Right, so I'll look for a story.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.206
So sorry. Monstrous of us
to have kept you waiting.

04:17.279 --> 04:20.089
Welcome to the Ministry
of Information Film Division.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.083
Roger Swain.
You must be Miss Cole.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.050
- Mrs.
- Ah, splendid. Please, take a seat.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.164
Husband in the forces?

04:28.240 --> 04:32.450
He volunteers as an air-raid warden,
but he wasn't fit for conscription.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.170
He fought in the war in Spain.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.322
Splendid, that's splendid.
Now, about the job.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.883
We need to cultivate a more convincing
female angle in our output.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.601
Mr. Buckley here has been appointed
to the department as a special adviser.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.007
Not special enough to get paid, obviously.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.889
He seems to think you're what we need.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.681
I said "might be." She can't be worse
than those chaps you've got.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.242
- Did you write this?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.561
It was wrapped around my chips.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.723
I was the secretary
at the copywriting department,

05:01.800 --> 05:04.451
but all the copywriters got called up.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.888
"So-Be-Fee. It ain't beef,
but it ain't bad,

05:07.960 --> 05:11.203
'cause sometimes you just have
to make do with what you've got."

05:11.280 --> 05:12.645
Ah, splendid.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.529
Ministry wages start at three and ten.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.331
And obviously, we can't pay you
as much as the chaps,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.562
so shall we say £2 a week?

05:19.640 --> 05:21.404
Thank you.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.845
- You a cinemagoer?
- Yes.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.207
Then you'll be familiar
with informationals.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.965
We sandwich them between the support
and the main feature,

05:28.040 --> 05:30.486
so the public to be informed
don't have time to escape.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.443
<i>What to do in an air raid.</i>

05:32.560 --> 05:33.721
<i>Get under cover at once.</i>

05:36.960 --> 05:40.601
<i>Don't stand staring at the sky.
Take cover at once.</i>

05:42.920 --> 05:45.571
You'll find a page of script equates
to a minute of screen time

05:45.640 --> 05:47.688
or roughly 80 yards of celluloid,

05:47.760 --> 05:50.525
or it would if directors
didn't squander the film stock

05:50.600 --> 05:52.762
as if it were lavatory paper.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.811
Speaking of which,
ladies' is last door on the left.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.486
I wouldn't risk the other facilities
if I were you.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.411
I thought it was a secretarial post.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.323
Oh, for God's sake, keep that to yourself.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.162
What did they say,
the War Artists Committee?

06:22.280 --> 06:27.605
They find my interpretations
altogether too brutal and dispiriting.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.643
You're so much better
than all the rest of them.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.088
All the rest of them manage
to put food on the table.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.808
Ellis, I had a meeting today...

06:51.080 --> 06:52.969
about a new job.

06:54.640 --> 06:59.601
They offered it to me.
£2 a week.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.967
You know, Perry wants you
to model for him.

07:05.680 --> 07:09.082
I told him only I'm allowed to paint you.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.401
You only ever put me in
for the perspective.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.848
No, I put you in
because I want you there.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.009
Right. I have to get
to the warden's post.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.169
It's a writing job.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.090
Well done, Catrin.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.449
When there's a raid, I want you to go down
to the tube station.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.604
I didn't bring you all the way from Wales
to see you hit by a bomb.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.442
<i>I saw April today.</i>

07:51.520 --> 07:53.568
She and Tony have made up
ever such a clever code,

07:53.640 --> 07:55.608
so he can write to her
about what he's doing.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.207
"The village green,"
that means "England."

07:59.280 --> 08:01.647
"Onion soup" is "France."

08:01.720 --> 08:03.290
There's a word for "regiment,"

08:03.360 --> 08:06.489
and one for "troop train."

08:06.560 --> 08:08.449
Do you really have
to smoke that thing?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.648
- Couldn't you just mime?
- I can mime smoking.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.489
I can't mime smoke.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.656
That's a cut.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.842
I wonder, would it be possible
to have some knitting?

08:15.920 --> 08:19.096
My hands are aching for something to do,
and it seems so right for the character.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.122
- Props!
- Yeah, I'll try and find some knitting.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.406
Walter, a word.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.776
I fully understand the national
importance of what we're shooting,

08:24.800 --> 08:27.644
and obviously there's no question
of diluting the message.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.245
I just...

08:29.360 --> 08:32.364
Wonder if it mightn't pack
a little more punch

08:32.440 --> 08:35.284
if Mr. Brown were
to express a little more.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.010
For example, at the mention
of the clever code,

08:38.120 --> 08:40.804
I might say, "Well, that'll be
the first clever thing

08:40.880 --> 08:42.291
April's ever done in her life."

08:44.320 --> 08:46.448
Do you see?
So, just a... Just a...

08:46.520 --> 08:49.649
Just a dash of humor.
And then further along...

08:49.720 --> 08:51.051
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.485
- Hello.
- Oh, certainly.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.525
Oh, no, no, no.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.291
It's just that the caption
at the end's going to be,

08:59.360 --> 09:02.569
"He's not listening,
but the enemy might be."

09:02.640 --> 09:06.008
It's a joke for women who think
their husbands never pay attention.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.527
So if you start answering her,
well, the caption won't make sense.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.530
I wrote it. The scenario.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.366
I'll be in my dressing room,
if anyone needs me.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.450
Ahem.
Everybody take ten.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.090
Save the lights.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.689
Banished from the set.
What in God's name possessed you?

09:31.800 --> 09:33.325
The actor was
ruining the script.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.050
Course he was. He's an actor.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.122
What's this? Penance?

09:37.200 --> 09:41.285
<i>- Hello, Mabel. How's baby?
- He's coming along splendidly.</i>

09:41.360 --> 09:44.569
<i>With more free time,
I should like to do some war work.</i>

09:44.640 --> 09:47.086
<i>I simply don't know what to do.</i>

09:47.160 --> 09:49.208
<i>Are you good with your hands?</i>

09:49.280 --> 09:51.521
<i>I think so, yes.</i>

09:51.600 --> 09:53.887
<i>Have you thought about factory work?</i>

09:55.760 --> 09:58.366
And the version
without the lines, please.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.886
They want to re-use
the footage for carrots.

10:00.960 --> 10:05.045
<i>- Hello, Mabel. How's baby?
- He's coming along splendidly.</i>

10:05.120 --> 10:07.248
An appetite like his father.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.765
He's eating us out of the house.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.411
<i>I simply don't know what to do.</i>

10:11.480 --> 10:14.051
<i>- Are you good...</i>
- ...in the garden?

10:14.120 --> 10:15.963
<i>I think so, yes.</i>

10:16.040 --> 10:17.849
<i>- Have you thought about...</i>
- ...carrots?

10:20.280 --> 10:22.169
Right, I'll get that recorded.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.606
- Thank you.
- How's it been, anyway?

10:28.680 --> 10:31.001
Boys in Scenarios
made you feel welcome?

10:31.080 --> 10:32.844
They can't see the point of me.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.331
"If there's a dog in the script,

10:34.400 --> 10:37.563
we don't employ a Jack Russell
to write 'woof-woof, ' do we?"

10:37.640 --> 10:41.167
Just been reading your work.
None of them could do better.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.766
Would you care for some lunch?

10:43.840 --> 10:46.411
Now, don't look so chapel.
It's official business.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.960
I've, uh, got a proposal for you.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.361
When I'm not busy
special advising,

10:57.440 --> 11:00.205
I work for a man called Gabriel Baker.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.647
Remember him?
The Hungarian.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.165
He's a producer.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.722
Desperate to make a film
that will make a difference.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.806
- Hello, Tom.
- Thelma.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.450
Sorry. Excuse me.

11:16.320 --> 11:20.120
Dunkirk. The evacuation of troops trapped
by the German advance.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.289
Seven hundred fishing boats
and the Royal Navy

11:23.360 --> 11:24.930
on a mission to bring our boys home.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.170
Twin sisters took their father's
cockle boat over to join the rescue,

11:29.240 --> 11:30.776
came back with a deck full of soldiers.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.122
- It's everything the Ministry are after.
- Authenticity and optimism.

11:34.200 --> 11:38.091
Contradiction in terms, if you ask me,
but this could be a bloody good story.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.256
Before they'll give it the go-ahead,

11:39.280 --> 11:41.886
they want someone to go down
there to talk to the girls.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.086
Me?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.686
Unless your artist would object.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.527
So, how did you meet?

11:52.600 --> 11:54.296
He came to Ebbw Vale
to paint the steelworks.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.243
Ah, he's one of those artists.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.771
- Older than you?
- Yes.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.841
- Fifty?
- No.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.287
Sixty? Oh, I bet he's a toff.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.856
No one else can afford to be an artist.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.644
Actually, his family disinherited him.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.440
- Because of you?
- Because of his politics.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.483
So what do you think?
A day at the seaside.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.720
And you never know, if there's
a film at the end of it,

12:13.760 --> 12:15.762
there might be a better job in it for you.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.370
We'll need someone to write the slop.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.408
- Slop?
- Girl talk.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.881
Women's dialogue.
"Woof, woof."

12:31.080 --> 12:34.084
Hello. I've come to see
Rose and Lily Starling.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.687
We're not to talk to the papers.
We're not to let no one in.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.125
I'm not from the papers.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.089
I'm from the Ministry of Information.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.447
The Film Division.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.841
Film?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.321
And you went to Dunkirk?

12:52.400 --> 12:56.644
We meant to, but the engine stopped
five miles out.

12:56.720 --> 13:00.088
Broken bearing.
We never got there.

13:00.160 --> 13:03.846
But in the paper, it said
you brought home troops.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.605
This steam tug on its way back
gave us a tow.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.361
There were soldiers spilling over
the rails, so we pulled some on the Nancy.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.922
Someone seen us docking
and put it in the paper.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.967
They got the wrong end
of the stick, didn't they?

13:18.040 --> 13:20.088
Dad said he'd be a laughingstock,

13:20.160 --> 13:23.801
said we mustn't tell the papers.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.646
But you ain't the papers.
You're the pictures.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.722
Can I ask the lady something?

13:31.200 --> 13:33.168
- Can Lily ask you something?
- Yes.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.847
Have you ever met Robert Donat?
The famous actor?

13:36.960 --> 13:39.361
No, no. No, I haven't, I'm afraid.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.406
Dad!

13:44.960 --> 13:47.611
Come quick.
Would you like to see the kitchen?

13:47.720 --> 13:49.085
It's not him.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.124
It's all right, Lil.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.282
He don't like strangers, see?

13:54.360 --> 13:56.522
He don't like a lot of things.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.604
And you took his boat without asking?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.325
Weren't you scared?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.448
One of the soldiers had this kit bag,

14:10.520 --> 14:13.285
and suddenly it woofed,
and it give us such a fright.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.486
It was a dog.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.845
And one of them Frenchies
tried to kiss Lil.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.611
No, I meant scared
of what your dad might do.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.411
No. He got himself a bottle.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.608
We thought we'd be back
before he woke up.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.041
Besides, Eric was in Dunkirk.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.169
- Eric?
- Dad's first mate.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.767
He got us photographs for our birthday.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.211
We've got the same birthday.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.450
Robert Donat in <i>The 39 Steps...</i>

14:46.440 --> 14:50.081
and John Clements
in <i>The Four Feathers.</i>

14:50.200 --> 14:51.929
Have you ever met John Clements?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.844
No, I haven't.

14:54.920 --> 14:58.083
Those ones are Mum's.
We don't know who he is.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.647
- Well, I did meet...
- Is it going to be a film?

15:07.480 --> 15:08.891
Probably not.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.320
Stupid bloody engine, eh?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.209
- What harm can one little drink do?
- My dad will throttle me if I'm late.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.964
Well, how about a kiss, then?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.166
- No, thank you.
- Come on!

15:22.240 --> 15:23.685
I could be back in action tomorrow.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.842
Shelterers to the left hand side.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.242
<i>Bona fide</i> passengers, come on!

15:29.320 --> 15:32.244
<i>Bona fide</i> passengers, to the right.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.604
Catrin?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.002
I got caught in the raid.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.406
I ended up in the Baker Street shelter.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.086
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know if you were safe.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.844
I never know if <i>you're safe.</i>

17:36.920 --> 17:38.251
God, look at you.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.482
I'll be all right after a cup of tea.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.007
The raid ruptured the mains.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.048
Now, Catrin, I...

17:48.160 --> 17:50.322
I want you to go back to Ebbw Vale.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.846
Ellis...

17:52.920 --> 17:56.641
It's the biggest steelworks in Europe.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.331
I'm more likely to get bombed
there than here.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.845
It's not just the bombing.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.960
I can't afford for us to live here
anymore.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.569
I can't afford for us to live anywhere.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.449
- But I earn.
- If I were on my own,

18:10.520 --> 18:12.568
I could doss down in Perry's studio.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.324
I could keep painting.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.006
But you don't have to keep me. I earn.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.686
Your wage assumes a husband who
can put a roof over your head.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.360
Please don't turn me into one
of those things that make it harder.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.209
Mr. Cole?
It's Alf, from downstairs.

18:27.280 --> 18:31.285
I'm not the war, I'm not the committee.
I'm what makes it better.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.648
- Mrs. Cole.
- Hello, Alf.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.210
Heavy Rescue.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.136
They wanna know how many in the cellar
at number 12.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.241
All right.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.245
<i>When the twins got to Dunkirk,</i>

19:19.320 --> 19:22.449
they did what every other small boat did,

19:22.520 --> 19:24.249
ferried troops off the beach

19:24.320 --> 19:27.369
and out to the big ships
waiting in the deeper water.

19:28.840 --> 19:34.165
There was shelling and strafing,
but they honestly didn't talk about that.

19:34.240 --> 19:39.644
What really seems to have stuck
with them are the details,

19:39.720 --> 19:42.485
the little authentic details.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.842
The soldier with a dog in his kit bag.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.242
Uh, the Frenchman
that tried to kiss Lily.

19:51.320 --> 19:55.041
I wish I could make you understand
how awfully brave they were.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.364
Their father's a bully,
I think, and a bit of a drunk.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.283
They're terrified of him,

20:01.360 --> 20:04.250
but they took his boat anyway,
the <i>Nancy.</i>

20:04.320 --> 20:06.971
- “The <i>Nancy"?</i>
- The <i>Nancy Starling.</i>

20:07.040 --> 20:09.884
- After their mother.
- The nail on the head.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.485
Mmm?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.411
On the head.

20:16.040 --> 20:21.001
Authenticity, optimism, and a dog.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.404
I imagine call-up's left
quite a hole in your ranks,

20:28.480 --> 20:32.690
so, in the interest of a quick turnaround,
we'll let you have some of our people.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.286
Mrs. Cole, Miss Moore.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.044
- Mmm-hmm?
- Yes.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.288
Be good to get this into the cinemas

20:40.360 --> 20:42.488
while there are still
a few of them standing.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.721
Mmm-hmm.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.326
Well done. Well done.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.606
Yeah.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.002
- Do I have the job?
- Well, why not?

20:51.080 --> 20:53.208
Twins, after all.
Double the slop.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.487
Temporary secondment
to Baker Productions.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.130
No screen credit.
Ministry wages.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.487
- I need more.
- I could throw in a desk.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.562
I need more than Ministry wages.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.043
I'll talk to Baker.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.442
Leslie Banks
is virtually my age,

21:10.520 --> 21:12.841
and he's still staggering
around the studios,

21:12.920 --> 21:15.526
giving his unhinged all
as young love gone bad...

21:15.600 --> 21:17.762
Oh, no, no, no, Cerberus.
Too much glass.

21:20.920 --> 21:24.527
You know, if you paid your clients half
as much attention as you do that hyena,

21:24.600 --> 21:26.136
you might actually be
an agent worth having.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.811
Spitfires.
Won't you help to buy...

21:28.880 --> 21:32.566
Ambrose Hilliard.
<i>The Man with the Glint.</i>

21:32.640 --> 21:35.769
Oh, I know it's a liberty, but would you
do him for me? Would you?

21:35.840 --> 21:37.285
Inspector Charnforth?

21:39.040 --> 21:40.644
"Someone has made a mistake.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.280
It's a simple mistake and easy to miss.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.283
I almost did so myself."

21:44.360 --> 21:46.124
Oh!

21:47.480 --> 21:49.130
Oh, um...

21:49.200 --> 21:52.249
- Spitfires, Sammy.
- In the pocket. The pocket.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.924
Ah.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.202
- Thank you.
- There.

21:56.280 --> 22:02.128
When... uh, when can we expect to see you
back on the screen, Mr. Hilliard?

22:02.200 --> 22:03.884
When indeed?

22:04.880 --> 22:07.611
Well, apparently Baker Films
have a Dunkirk script in the works.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.721
Mmm?

22:33.120 --> 22:34.963
Apparently, you'll be in here.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.890
They want a title.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.803
We haven't started bloody writing it yet.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.176
And they're asking about locations.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.690
Want me to start casting it, too?

22:50.760 --> 22:53.650
- Don't tempt me.
- A boat, a beach, twins.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.722
- That's all you're getting.
- Try Devon.

22:55.800 --> 22:59.202
Or Dunkirk. You can go
and scout it personally.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.127
Her, seconded here to spy on us.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.362
You tell her nothing, understand?

23:07.440 --> 23:10.808
We'll have every government department
and his wife sticking their oar in.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.167
Desk. Parfitt, you've met.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.811
Writing partner.
Delighted to have you on board.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.044
Report.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.451
So, what do you think?

23:47.520 --> 23:49.443
Uh, the father leaves a bad taste.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.761
Drunken sailor angle's good, though.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.650
Make him an uncle.
Uncle Frank.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.085
- Yeah.
- Soused in the hold.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.400
Wakes up in Dunkirk.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.244
Double-take
when he sees the Stukas.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.607
Gives us our laughs,
then takes a bullet in act three.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.365
- Comic life, tragic death.
- Tears all round.

24:04.440 --> 24:08.604
Yeah. First mate, bloke in France,
needs to be a boyfriend.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.047
- Rose or Lily's?
- Either.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.407
Both? What are they like?

24:13.480 --> 24:16.962
Shy, quiet. Lily hardly spoke.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.611
- One quiet, one chatty.
- They're both quiet.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.411
- Not if we want any dialogue.
- How old are they?

24:22.520 --> 24:24.522
- Thirty?
- Ah, marvelous.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.251
Working title, <i>Old Maids of Margate.</i>

24:27.360 --> 24:28.930
It's Southend.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.641
Twenty-one, Lily sweet, Rose spunky.
Rose gets the boyfriend.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.722
"My darling, I couldn't die

24:34.800 --> 24:37.963
without seeing the cornflower blue
of your eyes a final time."

24:38.080 --> 24:40.208
You can have that one on me.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.681
What's his name, the boyfriend?

24:42.760 --> 24:44.285
Eric. Eric Lumb.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.646
Do you hear that noise?

24:45.720 --> 24:47.449
That's 200 women in the one and nines

24:47.520 --> 24:51.684
vowing aloud never to call their sons
anything as bloody feeble as Eric.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.962
- Now give me a hero's name.
- John.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.371
- Dull.
- Johnnie.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.488
- Mmm-hmm.
- He'll have to make it back.

24:58.600 --> 25:02.400
- Injured.
- A risk. A rescue.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.536
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie.
There's a sniper out there!"

25:04.560 --> 25:06.767
- Yep. Mm...
- Saves his commanding officer.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.524
Fellow soldier?

25:08.600 --> 25:10.409
Saves the dog.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.609
But he didn't.
In real life, he didn't.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.409
Film, Mrs. Cole.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.450
Real life with the boring bits cut out.

25:18.520 --> 25:21.251
Don't confuse facts with truth
and, for Christ's sake,

25:21.320 --> 25:23.721
don't let either of them
get in the way of the story.

25:23.800 --> 25:28.089
Now we know how it starts.
Johnnie in France.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.924
- We know how it ends.
- Home safe.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.889
And we know that
somewhere in between

25:31.960 --> 25:35.487
we have dog, Dunkirk,

25:35.560 --> 25:38.291
engine failure, and uncle's death.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.649
Now all we have to do is fill in the gaps.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.126
I'm buying it.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.845
Down payment.

26:15.760 --> 26:20.288
Call it rent, call it what you like,
but I am not leaving London.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.562
- Hmm!
- Sorry. Bad night.

26:42.640 --> 26:46.725
Buckley, Parfitt, meeting now.
Ministry of War Transport.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.690
Seems they've had wind of
your proposed filmic scenario.

26:49.760 --> 26:53.526
Apparently, they're concerned
that "the <i>Nancy Starling's</i> engine failure

26:53.600 --> 26:58.891
may cast morale-sapping doubt
on the quality of British engineering."

27:05.800 --> 27:08.724
It was her.
Bloody Ministry spy.

27:11.720 --> 27:15.964
What if it's not the engine?
What if it's the propeller?

27:16.040 --> 27:17.530
It gets snarled up with flotsam,

27:17.600 --> 27:20.251
Uncle Frank goes in the water
to free it, gets shot,

27:20.320 --> 27:22.641
and the girls have to finish
the job under fire.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.896
- Not the girls.
- Not the girls?

27:23.920 --> 27:26.002
- No. Uh, Johnnie.
- Johnnie?

27:26.120 --> 27:28.202
- Is there an echo in here?
- Why him?

27:28.280 --> 27:30.362
- Because he's the hero.
- So?

27:30.440 --> 27:32.976
Well, how do we know he's the hero
if he never does anything heroic?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.040
Well, he's called Johnnie.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.736
Are you trying to pick
a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?

27:35.760 --> 27:39.162
Johnnie can't go in the water.
He's injured, badly injured.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.686
A manly slash on the bicep,
for Christ's sake.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.286
He's not gonna be leaking spleen
through his trousers.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.289
This is Rose and Lily's story,
and you won't let them do anything.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.931
- They go to Dunkirk.
- And Johnnie pilots them home.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.048
They're girls. Girls don't
want to be the hero.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.056
They want to have the hero.
They want to <i>be had by</i> him.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.445
- Tom, cab.
- Oh!

27:57.520 --> 27:59.727
And if that ginger viper
so much as gets her nose

27:59.800 --> 28:01.856
through the office door
while we're out, you're sacked.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.282
And don't think I won't know.
I can smell her shaving cream on the wind.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.768
Anything else?

28:08.840 --> 28:11.571
Since you're so keen to flex
your femininity, you can tidy up!

28:27.640 --> 28:29.130
I heard furniture.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.767
<i>"Angels of the Sea.
Across the Waves.</i>

28:37.840 --> 28:40.320
<i>Two to Dunkirk.
Three to Dunkirk.</i>

28:40.400 --> 28:43.882
<i>Dunkirk or Bust.
Busts to Dunkirk."</i>

28:45.160 --> 28:49.165
Somewhere in the world there is
a bullet with that man's name on.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.810
Why hasn't he been called up?

28:50.880 --> 28:53.645
I mean, Parfitt's too old, but Buckley...

28:53.720 --> 28:55.051
Baker persuaded someone

28:55.120 --> 28:58.090
that Buckley was more use
to the war effort with a typewriter.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.648
It won't last.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.920
He'll end up in uniform,
like every other mother's son.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.487
That is, if he ever had a mother.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.325
More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub,

29:10.400 --> 29:13.165
spawning spontaneously
in the sawdust.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.681
You know,
a lot of men are scared

29:16.760 --> 29:19.684
we won't go back into our boxes
when this is all over.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.969
It makes them belligerent.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.488
Something's changed.

29:43.560 --> 29:46.928
I tidied.
What happened at the meeting?

29:47.000 --> 29:50.800
I outlined our proposed changes.
They accepted them.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.805
- What's this?
- Lunch.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.641
The girls can pilot
the boat home, all right?

30:09.960 --> 30:11.405
They can pilot the bloody boat.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.562
They can lead the damn fleet,
for all I care.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.529
But Johnnie frees the propeller.

30:20.600 --> 30:21.647
Hmm.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.890
You're late. I took
the liberty of ordering.

30:49.960 --> 30:54.170
Sorry. We have guests staying,
friends from Poland.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.402
Things are very bad in Europe.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.600
It's not exactly a picnic here,
if you hadn't noticed.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.887
You can't find a decent waiter in SoHo
since Italy joined the war.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.964
They were all rounded up as so-called
enemies of the state,

31:06.040 --> 31:10.682
apart from Geppetto over there,
who almost certainly <i>is</i> a spy.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.524
Cerberus!

31:18.400 --> 31:20.004
Ugh!

31:20.080 --> 31:21.923
Christ, a dead sheep?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.287
- Ugh.
- Not strictly ration book,

31:24.400 --> 31:26.721
but Cerberus can't live
on crusts and scraps.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.040
Ugh...

31:28.120 --> 31:30.726
Sophie's going to boil it up
and make him some broth.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.802
Lucky fellow.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.688
Well, perhaps your sister would
like to start feeding <i>me,</i> too,

31:37.760 --> 31:40.525
unless, of course, you've actually
found me some work.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.763
So, Baker's outline for the Dunkirk film,
you read it?

31:43.880 --> 31:46.804
It rattles along rather better
than one might have expected.

31:46.880 --> 31:51.044
Johnnie's escape from the steel thrust
of the German war machine.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.771
The rescue of the dog was very good.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.043
Here, boy. Here.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.483
No, no. No, not you, Cerberus.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.530
Of course, it all depends on who
they're planning to cast as Rose.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.605
Uncle Frank?

32:19.440 --> 32:23.604
"A shipwreck of a man"? Sammy!

32:24.800 --> 32:27.565
"Sixties. Looks older"?

32:27.640 --> 32:29.961
Senior roles are not
to be sneered at, Ambrose.

32:30.040 --> 32:34.011
- Gravitas. Experience. Maturity.
- Ugh.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.456
We all have a part to play
in defeating Hitler.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.768
Not this part. It's a corpse role.
He's dead before the end of act three.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.611
Mr. Smith.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.887
- Mmm-mmm.
- Mr. Hilliard.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.084
Ambrose, you must see...

32:48.160 --> 32:51.050
You, me, the industry, we are all
at the service of the war now.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.681
The war. The war.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.240
Damn the bloody war!

32:57.320 --> 33:02.042
The war has skimmed off the cream,
and we're left with the rancid curds!

33:11.840 --> 33:14.525
I'm sorry I took so long.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.410
There was a bomb crater
on the Marylebone Road. Oh!

33:17.480 --> 33:19.244
No one told me there was a meeting.

33:19.320 --> 33:22.927
No, we've been rather trying to keep this
under wraps for the present.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.483
It seems that there's a someone
in Mr. Swain's department

33:27.560 --> 33:32.088
who knows a someone who says that
the Starling sisters never got to Dunkirk.

33:33.080 --> 33:38.291
That their engine broke down before
they were even out of British waters.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.644
Pity. Pity all round, really.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.848
Your first draft boded so well.

33:49.080 --> 33:52.641
- Well...
- So the Starling sisters lied?

33:52.720 --> 33:54.609
What difference does it really make?

33:54.680 --> 33:57.411
For God's sake, of course it makes
a difference. It's not the truth.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.609
The truth is, they stole a boat
from a man who terrified them

34:00.680 --> 34:04.730
and set out to cross 50 miles
of open sea into a war.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.009
- They never got there.
- Because their engine failed.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.721
Now, there's a truth we won't be telling.
Morale-sapping, apparently.

34:13.199 --> 34:15.726
We pick our truths.
Isn't that the point?

34:15.800 --> 34:18.724
We're saying this is based
on a true story.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.040
Then don't.

34:20.159 --> 34:23.562
Oh, Christ above, man, you're supposed
to be the propagandist!

34:23.639 --> 34:29.761
700 ships went to Dunkirk.
338,000 men came back.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.530
Don't say it's based on a true story.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.601
Say it's based on 100 true stories.

34:33.679 --> 34:36.967
- A thousand.
- 338,000.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.926
Dunkirk, the biggest retreat
in military history,

34:42.000 --> 34:45.925
or the miracle that put the fire back
in all our bellies?

34:47.880 --> 34:51.487
Very well, carry on as you were.
I have a car waiting.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.847
You won't regret it.
Thank you, Mr. Swain.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.006
Buckley!

35:23.640 --> 35:24.846
Buckley!

35:28.480 --> 35:30.244
Sit. Sit.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.840
I don't care that you lied.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.082
I care that you lied to us.

35:38.160 --> 35:40.527
There wasn't enough money.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.204
Ellis wanted me to go back to Wales.

35:42.280 --> 35:44.760
And you what, you couldn't bear
to miss the Blitz?

35:44.840 --> 35:46.649
I'm sorry.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.371
Well, at least Parfitt will be relieved.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.123
His wife, Mary, she's an invalid.

35:54.200 --> 35:59.331
He pays for a nurse in the day, but then
he has to sit with her himself at night.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.767
When I told him you wanted
more than Ministry wages,

36:01.840 --> 36:05.287
he was worried you'd found yourself
in a similar position,

36:05.360 --> 36:08.250
what with your husband's Spanish War
wound and all.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.081
Should I...

36:14.760 --> 36:16.967
Do you want me to come in tomorrow?

36:17.040 --> 36:18.929
And how would that help, losing you?

36:20.160 --> 36:23.403
Who the bloody hell else do you think's
gonna be writing the slop?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.762
The work's good, Mrs. Cole.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.049
You're doing a good job.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.486
Hello, Catrin.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.450
- Hello.
- Hello.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.681
Ellis?

37:03.360 --> 37:05.931
I just saw Perry and Conroy.
You had friends over?

37:09.480 --> 37:10.811
I got a letter.

37:10.880 --> 37:14.248
A commission to document
bomb damage in the provinces,

37:14.320 --> 37:17.369
and an exhibition in London
straight after.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.649
The National Gallery.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.085
Oh, Ellis.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.122
Will there be Sunday trains,
do you think?

37:32.200 --> 37:35.010
Only I'll need to get back
to London on Monday mornings.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.045
- What are you talking about?
- Coming to see you.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.360
Well, you'll be <i>with me,</i> silly.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.401
Yes, of course.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.529
After the script is finished.

37:51.480 --> 37:54.484
Well, you can get out of that now, surely.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.483
But I don't want to get out of it.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.287
I don't want to let them down.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.242
No, of course not.

38:05.320 --> 38:09.291
Well, I leave on Monday, and I'll be back
in London for the exhibition.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.886
I suppose it's not so very far off.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.930
No, it's not so very far off.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.048
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.851
Right, then.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.802
Veal's off. I've ordered
cutlets Milanese...

38:38.440 --> 38:41.887
and semolina... pudding.

38:41.960 --> 38:45.089
You are Mr. Ambrose Hilliard?

38:45.160 --> 38:46.525
Yes.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.567
I'm Sophie Smith, Sammy's sister.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.091
Ah.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.164
His office.

38:56.240 --> 38:59.483
Last night, he was working late.
It was bombed.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.922
They have asked me to identify him.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.365
I am unable.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.449
Mr. Hilliard?

39:44.760 --> 39:46.330
Mr. Hilliard?

39:47.400 --> 39:50.847
I'm afraid, my dear,
someone has made a mistake.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.570
I almost did so myself.

39:52.640 --> 39:58.522
You see, Sammy Smith has two fingers
missing from his left hand.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.206
I'm sorry, we try very hard to...

40:02.560 --> 40:05.166
to make a whole person.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.288
For the relatives.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.561
Oh!

40:17.640 --> 40:20.962
Is it him?
Is it your friend?

40:24.160 --> 40:25.491
My agent.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.121
Yes.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.611
That's him.

40:34.200 --> 40:36.043
You can stay with us, if you like.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.967
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.364
Thank you.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.682
Happy New Year, Mr. Hilliard.

42:56.200 --> 42:59.727
Sammy liked the veal, I believe.
Do you also recommend it?

42:59.800 --> 43:05.091
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.

43:05.160 --> 43:07.208
Oh.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.331
Um, now that Sam...

43:14.760 --> 43:16.330
Now that my brother has gone,

43:16.400 --> 43:19.927
I must find something
with which to occupy myself.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.402
I have responsibilities, dependents.

43:23.480 --> 43:26.404
I have decided therefore
to continue with the agency.

43:29.280 --> 43:35.049
I understand Sammy discussed
with you Baker's Dunkirk film,

43:35.120 --> 43:38.203
- the role of the inebriated uncle.
- No.

43:42.080 --> 43:47.371
You know, after conversations
like this with my brother, I would say,

43:47.440 --> 43:50.603
"What have you got to lose
by being honest, Sammy?

43:50.680 --> 43:55.083
Explain to the man he is 63, not 36.

43:55.160 --> 43:58.562
And that his brief moment
of fame as Inspector Charnfort..."

43:58.640 --> 44:00.847
Charnforth!
Inspector Charnforth!

44:00.920 --> 44:02.809
Please be calm, Mr. Hilliard.

44:02.880 --> 44:05.770
I am perfectly calm.

44:05.840 --> 44:10.368
What you are seeing is controlled anger
tempered with icy detachment.

44:10.440 --> 44:14.809
It's one of the many subtle emotions
of which a good actor is capable.

44:14.920 --> 44:18.367
Three weeks on location in Devon,

44:18.440 --> 44:20.602
followed by three in a London studio.

44:22.760 --> 44:27.402
There are currently only nine films
in pre-production in British studios.

44:27.480 --> 44:30.086
None of the others holds a role for you.

44:30.160 --> 44:35.166
I hope I share some of my brother's
qualities, Mr. Ambrose.

44:35.240 --> 44:39.006
I do not, however, share
his sentimental attachments.

44:39.080 --> 44:42.641
I will not keep unprofitable clients
on the books.

44:42.720 --> 44:45.200
Veal, twice, please.

44:46.520 --> 44:48.682
Oh, and semolina pudding?

44:49.800 --> 44:51.609
Excellent choice.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.810
Too long. Lose half.

45:27.880 --> 45:30.008
- Which half?
- The half you don't need.

45:30.120 --> 45:32.088
What's the matter?

45:32.160 --> 45:33.969
You look like
you haven't slept in a month.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.724
I'm all right.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.616
I just found it easier
when it was every night.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.290
At least you knew what was coming.

45:39.360 --> 45:41.886
Well, never having known the joys
of married love myself...

45:41.960 --> 45:44.531
- The bombing.
- Ah.

45:44.600 --> 45:49.162
I thought perhaps too many long treks
to see the husband in the provinces.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.208
Not really.

45:52.280 --> 45:56.001
It's difficult, you know? The trains.

46:12.440 --> 46:13.771
All right, then

46:13.840 --> 46:16.081
What's that?

46:16.160 --> 46:18.811
- It's France, Uncle Frank.
- Oh.

46:21.480 --> 46:23.164
Oh!

46:24.440 --> 46:26.522
It's Hitler!

46:28.000 --> 46:31.004
- Bloody what?
- Meeting now with Mr. Swain.

46:31.080 --> 46:33.970
Rot. We're about to issue this
as a shooting script.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.451
- They want all of you.
- Oh, no.

46:35.560 --> 46:37.767
Oh, don't worry.
All that's dead and buried.

46:37.840 --> 46:39.922
No, this'll be some rear admiral
in a lather

46:40.000 --> 46:42.336
because we've got the wind speed wrong
for the day in question.

46:42.360 --> 46:45.125
Oh, and did I mention?
It's at Whitehall.

46:45.200 --> 46:46.531
The Ministry of War.

46:48.920 --> 46:53.130
"We few, we happy few,

46:53.200 --> 46:55.601
we band of brothers.

46:55.680 --> 46:59.810
For he today who sheds his blood
with me shall be my brother.

46:59.920 --> 47:02.571
And gentlemen in England now abed

47:02.640 --> 47:05.883
shall think themselves
accursed they were not here,

47:05.960 --> 47:08.327
and hold their manhood cheap

47:08.400 --> 47:14.726
whilst any speak who fought with us
upon Saint Crispin's Day."

47:18.800 --> 47:21.963
The power of the dramatic arts.

47:30.720 --> 47:32.529
Ah...

47:32.600 --> 47:34.090
America.

47:34.160 --> 47:40.441
Firmly against any military involvement
in a war they see as Europe's business.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.887
I'm sure I need not tell <i>you</i>

47:42.960 --> 47:46.203
how many people attend the cinema
every week in this country.

47:48.320 --> 47:50.721
- Thirty...
- Thirty million.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.804
And in America
that figure is closer to 90.

47:53.880 --> 47:58.249
Mr. Churchill is persuaded that film,

47:58.320 --> 48:00.402
in particular <i>your</i> film,

48:00.520 --> 48:05.481
presents us with a unique opportunity
to put our case to the American people.

48:05.560 --> 48:07.642
They fear that we are already beaten.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.802
You show that we fight on.

48:11.480 --> 48:16.691
They believe this country to be dominated
by an upper-class elite.

48:16.760 --> 48:21.163
You present a vision of Britain

48:21.240 --> 48:23.925
in which ordinary working people
are the heroes.

48:25.480 --> 48:27.084
But most crucially of all,

48:27.160 --> 48:33.850
your film concerns itself directly
with the feminine experience,

48:33.920 --> 48:36.491
to show your American sisters

48:36.600 --> 48:40.924
that this is a war their sons
and husbands and brothers

48:41.000 --> 48:43.367
should be fighting.

48:43.480 --> 48:47.963
Of course, if we want America to listen,
we must give them someone to listen to,

48:48.040 --> 48:51.567
a character with whom
they can really identify.

48:51.640 --> 48:55.167
- You want us to put an American in it?
- Exactly so.

48:55.240 --> 48:58.562
Ideally, of course, one would cast
a star with British connections,

48:58.640 --> 49:00.722
a Cary Grant or an Errol Flynn,

49:00.800 --> 49:05.283
but the war will not wait on the
convenience of a Hollywood schedule.

49:05.360 --> 49:09.968
Besides, we rather think
we've done one better.

49:13.920 --> 49:16.207
<i>Carl Lundbeck.</i>

49:16.280 --> 49:19.250
<i>American boy,
Norwegian forefathers.</i>

49:19.320 --> 49:23.006
<i>Before the war, he flew crop dusters
on his parents' farm in Michigan.</i>

49:25.760 --> 49:27.762
<i>When Germany invaded Norway,</i>

49:27.840 --> 49:30.525
<i>Carl made his way to England
to join the RAF...</i>

49:35.040 --> 49:38.328
<i>where he's made himself
very much at home.</i>

49:41.360 --> 49:42.691
<i>Salmon aren't the only creatures</i>

49:42.760 --> 49:45.127
<i>who should stay out of Flight Lieutenant
Lundbeck's way.</i>

49:45.200 --> 49:48.647
<i>So far he's shot down 24 German planes,</i>

49:48.720 --> 49:51.610
<i>for which Britain gives her gratitude.</i>

49:54.000 --> 49:56.048
A genuine hero.

49:57.960 --> 50:02.887
An inspiration to all other Americans,
and, as I believe you chaps say,

50:02.960 --> 50:04.803
- the camera loves him.
- Yeah.

50:06.280 --> 50:08.760
Even more if he was in Technicolor.

50:10.080 --> 50:14.768
Color? I think we can manage that.

50:14.840 --> 50:17.446
But there weren't
any Americans at Dunkirk.

50:17.520 --> 50:18.965
Pedant

50:19.040 --> 50:21.691
Pack your bags, Mrs. Cole.
You're coming to Devon.

50:30.160 --> 50:32.447
<i>♪ Pretty copper kettle,
pretty copper kettle ♪</i>

50:32.520 --> 50:35.000
<i>♪ Bright copper kettle,
bright copper kettle ♪</i>

50:35.080 --> 50:37.048
<i>♪ I've got to get a kettle
I've got to get... ♪</i>

50:37.120 --> 50:39.441
<i>♪ I've got to get a kettle,
I've got to get a kettle ♪</i>

50:39.520 --> 50:42.046
<i>♪ Pretty copper kettle... ♪</i>

50:42.120 --> 50:43.451
I'm nearly finished.

50:43.560 --> 50:45.927
No, you're completely finished.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.721
If I hear the fucking word "kettle"
one more fucking time,

50:49.800 --> 50:53.122
I'm gonna find one
and shove it up your arse.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.885
- Sideways.
- Mm...

51:03.600 --> 51:04.806
Sorry.

51:13.160 --> 51:15.256
I think some Fuller's earth
through your hair and grease.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.281
God. Fuller's earth?

51:16.360 --> 51:18.840
But I would like to make your eyebrows
really unruly, you know,

51:18.920 --> 51:20.856
so that they're sticking out
in different directions.

51:20.880 --> 51:23.611
- Different directions? What, you...
- And then...

51:23.680 --> 51:28.288
I'd rather have four honest words
than 50 pages of bilge.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.489
- Now, you play Rose...
- No, I play Rose.

51:31.560 --> 51:32.971
And I play Lily.

51:33.040 --> 51:36.965
This script is the best thing I have read
in a month of Sundays.

51:37.040 --> 51:38.451
- Don't you think?
- Well...

51:38.520 --> 51:40.841
- Wyndham Best. I play Johnnie.
- Johnnie?

51:40.920 --> 51:42.445
- The soldier.
- Ah.

51:42.520 --> 51:45.251
Or the hero, if you will.

51:45.320 --> 51:47.368
...a documentary
about the Clydeside dockers.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.805
Right. Who have we got here?

51:48.880 --> 51:52.043
Ah, Alex, mind if I join you?

51:52.120 --> 51:54.521
Documentary makers and authenticity.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.841
The rancid curds.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.401
Buckley, just hide me, hide me.

52:03.480 --> 52:04.811
What?

52:04.880 --> 52:07.770
Uncle Frank. Mr. Hilliard.

52:07.840 --> 52:11.003
- You knew he was gonna be here.
- Yes, but <i>I</i> didn't expect to be.

52:11.080 --> 52:13.924
Is she all right?

52:14.000 --> 52:17.129
Avoiding Hilliard.
Unfortunate experience.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.965
- Carnal?
- What? No.

52:20.040 --> 52:22.850
Oh, that? Oh, I shouldn't
worry about that.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.684
He's an actor.

52:24.760 --> 52:29.049
Unless you review them, have intercourse
with them, or do both simultaneously,

52:29.120 --> 52:31.009
they don't remember you.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.730
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

52:32.800 --> 52:36.043
it is my privilege
to introduce you now

52:36.120 --> 52:40.330
to a young man to whom
we all owe a great deal.

52:40.400 --> 52:45.201
Soon we hand him back to the RAF
for a very different kind of shooting.

52:45.280 --> 52:48.966
Until then,
he is our very own American.

52:50.440 --> 52:53.364
Mr. Carl Lundbeck.

52:53.480 --> 52:56.131
- Hi. Hello.
- Alex Frayle, director.

52:56.200 --> 52:58.771
Hi. Good to meet you.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.842
Wyndham Best. How do you do?
I'm playing Johnnie.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.570
Carl Lundbeck, Flight Lieutenant.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.251
- Hi.
- Hello.

53:07.720 --> 53:09.688
- Mr. Hilliard.
- If I've got the right...

53:09.760 --> 53:11.649
Mr. Ambrose Hilliard.

53:11.720 --> 53:13.210
Yes.

53:13.280 --> 53:17.251
Sir, I saw every Inspector Charnforth
picture there ever was.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.448
Just used to go right back
and watch them again.

53:19.520 --> 53:20.646
Oh!

53:20.720 --> 53:24.008
"You see, someone has
made a mistake."

53:24.080 --> 53:25.730
"A simple mistake, but easy to miss."

53:27.200 --> 53:29.202
Yes! Oh!

53:30.960 --> 53:32.200
Sir, I need to wire my mom.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.320
There's our secret weapon.

53:36.400 --> 53:41.201
Now you write him in.
No excuses and no bar bills.

53:41.320 --> 53:44.403
- God bless America.
- God bless America.

53:46.280 --> 53:49.602
- Well, he's very handsome.
- Oh, come on!

53:51.280 --> 53:53.931
So, what's an American doing in Dunkirk?

53:54.040 --> 53:55.280
No, scrub that.

53:55.360 --> 53:56.850
- What isn't he doing?
- Fighting.

53:56.960 --> 54:00.282
- Yeah, so what does that make him?
- A priest?

54:00.360 --> 54:02.647
- No, we need a hero.
- I don't know...

54:02.760 --> 54:06.003
- Travel writer? Journalist?
- A journalist.

54:06.080 --> 54:11.405
Hard-boiled, wise-cracking Yankee hack
who can pilot a boat heroically.

54:11.480 --> 54:13.767
You're not pinching any more action
from Rose and Lily.

54:13.840 --> 54:16.320
I'm not unpicking
the entire bloody structure either.

54:16.440 --> 54:18.807
Will somebody give them
a hand over there, please?

54:18.880 --> 54:20.291
All the way up.

54:20.400 --> 54:23.768
Of course, the irony is,

54:23.840 --> 54:26.730
they've given this to a bloody
documentaries director.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.200
He won't want any dialogue, anyway.

54:28.240 --> 54:31.244
It will all be fishing nets
and local kids playing football, you wait.

54:31.320 --> 54:34.722
What if it's not what the American does
that makes him heroic,

54:34.800 --> 54:36.848
it's what he doesn't do?

54:36.960 --> 54:38.450
He falls for Rose,

54:38.520 --> 54:40.496
but he doesn't try to come
between her and Johnnie.

54:40.520 --> 54:42.284
Self-sacrifice, that's noble.

54:42.360 --> 54:45.569
- Only if he stands a chance.
- Maybe he does.

54:45.640 --> 54:50.202
Maybe she likes him, because he's the sort
that'd let <i>her</i> fix the propeller.

54:53.480 --> 54:55.528
So give him a name, our journalist.

54:55.600 --> 54:56.965
Joe.

54:57.040 --> 54:58.804
Hard-boiled types only have last names.

54:58.880 --> 55:00.689
- Buckley.
- Taken.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.528
And what were you
before you became Cole?

55:04.600 --> 55:05.931
Catherine Pugh.

55:07.960 --> 55:11.442
- Catherine?
- Catrin's the Welsh version.

55:11.520 --> 55:15.844
It was <i>his</i> idea. "A beautiful Welsh girl
deserves a beautiful Welsh name."

55:15.920 --> 55:17.445
Where would you have drawn the line?

55:17.520 --> 55:19.443
"Cardiff Cole.

55:19.520 --> 55:22.410
Caerphilly Cole.
Coalmine Cole."

55:25.240 --> 55:26.241
Hey!

55:27.520 --> 55:28.885
Those were my chips!

55:28.960 --> 55:31.281
Right, Catherine Pugh,
you're coming with me.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.040
All right.

55:55.320 --> 55:58.847
Brannigan, Johnnie, positions.

55:58.920 --> 56:01.400
- No. Uh, no, thank you.
- Let... Let me.

56:01.480 --> 56:04.643
Quiet, please.
Quiet, please, everyone.

56:04.720 --> 56:05.721
Thank you.

56:12.400 --> 56:15.006
I'll give you a finger click
for a sniper shot.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.321
Just a very quiet click, please.

56:17.400 --> 56:20.165
It's hard to explain to a non-actor,

56:20.240 --> 56:23.528
but I want to react
to the sniper up there

56:23.600 --> 56:26.046
And not the click down here.
Do you see?

56:26.120 --> 56:29.203
In fact, there's no chance of firing
a real gun up there, is there?

56:29.320 --> 56:31.607
- No.
- Right.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.648
Going for a take. Sound?

56:33.720 --> 56:35.370
Sound rolling.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.602
Speed.

56:37.680 --> 56:41.366
Dunkirk film, scene 17, take one.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.090
Good luck, Lieutenant Lundbeck.

56:46.360 --> 56:47.600
Action!

56:47.680 --> 56:50.331
Here, boy.

56:50.400 --> 56:52.084
Here.

56:52.160 --> 56:54.367
Come on, boy.

56:57.120 --> 56:59.327
Don't be a fool, Johnnie.
There's a sniper out there.

56:59.400 --> 57:02.324
And he's got a friend.
It's a Karabiner 98 Kurz.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.160
Best damn gun since the Win...

57:04.200 --> 57:05.440
...chester 73.

57:09.160 --> 57:12.642
I'm most awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I've lost my line.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.688
Cut.

57:15.920 --> 57:18.400
Jesus.

57:18.480 --> 57:20.881
Twenty-three takes.

57:20.960 --> 57:24.043
We only stopped because
we ran out of film stock.

57:24.120 --> 57:26.327
The War Office wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.

57:26.400 --> 57:29.131
And no one thought to give him
a bloody screen test?

57:30.440 --> 57:32.647
Well, can't we replace him?

57:32.760 --> 57:34.296
This film has a significant part to play

57:34.320 --> 57:36.216
in putting the national case
to the American public.

57:36.240 --> 57:38.527
- He's the template.
- If that lump of Yank stays,

57:38.640 --> 57:40.847
the film fails
and the national case with it.

57:40.920 --> 57:44.003
He is a brave boy.

57:44.080 --> 57:46.162
Would you or I be so brave?

58:27.200 --> 58:29.726
Is Mr. Baker all right?

58:29.800 --> 58:32.724
- He lost one of his grandsons.
- Oh...

58:32.800 --> 58:37.089
- Hit by a tram on shore leave.
- Oh!

58:37.200 --> 58:40.807
It must make it so much worse
that it wasn't for anything.

58:40.880 --> 58:43.884
- Poor Mr. Baker.
- It's never for anything.

58:45.920 --> 58:49.367
Why do you think people like films?

58:49.440 --> 58:52.364
It's because stories are structure.

58:52.440 --> 58:56.001
They're a shape, a purpose, a meaning.

58:58.080 --> 59:01.721
And when things turn bad, it's still
part of a plan, you know, it's...

59:01.800 --> 59:03.165
There's a point to it.

59:04.760 --> 59:07.525
Unlike life.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.887
You don't believe in much, do you?

59:09.960 --> 59:12.281
I believed this was gonna be
a good picture.

59:14.040 --> 59:18.011
How did you get to do this?
Writing, I mean.

59:18.080 --> 59:20.003
Parfitt.

59:20.080 --> 59:22.686
He was making comedies for Baker.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.489
I used to collect gags
I heard in the street

59:24.560 --> 59:27.166
and sell them to him
in the pub, penny a time.

59:27.240 --> 59:28.969
Phyl thinks that
you were born in the pub.

59:29.040 --> 59:31.407
I certainly spent
enough time in them as a kid.

59:36.160 --> 59:38.481
He was a soldier, my dad,
in the last one.

59:41.760 --> 59:44.889
The thing about men who get
sent away to war, Mrs. Cole,

59:44.960 --> 59:48.726
is that some of them
don't come back at all,

59:48.800 --> 59:51.087
some come back as heroes...

59:53.600 --> 59:56.490
and some of them come back
drunk, squalid bullies.

59:56.560 --> 59:58.642
I was better off out of his way.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.441
- In the pub.
- Or the pictures.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.489
I liked the pictures best.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.811
Once in a while you just need
to make one that's worth it,

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:17.891
worth the hour and a half of someone's
life it's gonna cost them to see it.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.407
I really thought this one would be.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.401
The bloody Yanks.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.524
It would be all right if all you had to do
was look at him.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.766
We strip Lundbeck's dialogue
down to essentials and use a voiceover.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.481
"I wasn't there
at the beginning of the story,

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.088
but it all began in a little fishing
village in England."

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.766
Yes, yes. inarticulacy, authenticity.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.601
- He still can't act.
- No, no, he really can't.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.327
But Hilliard can, so we get
Hilliard to coach him,

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.085
some sort of on-the-spot dumb show,

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.776
so the Yank knows
what he's meant to be doing.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.771
Gentlemen, I fear there has been
some sort of misapprehension.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.561
I am an actor,
a somewhat derided calling,

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.563
but mine nonetheless.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.405
Perhaps because we are engaged
in an imitation of life,

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.804
there is a common misconception
that anything living can do what we do.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.723
You have found that not to be so,

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.850
for which I offer my, um,
sincerest commiserations.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.720
But I am an actor.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.371
I know only my art.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.729
Of teaching, of coaching, of dumb show,

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.848
of these things,
I'm afraid I know nothing.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.362
I'm so sorry to disappoint.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.762
Mr. Hilliard, you're right.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.366
You're right.
Everything you just said.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.002
It's about respect for the art
and for the artists.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.641
And it makes me think
how wrong we've been,

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.324
playing Uncle Frank for laughs.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.006
Yes, he's a drunkard and a clown,

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.966
but he's also all those people
who gave their sons to one war

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.611
and now their grandsons to another.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.171
If we served that truth,

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.802
if we gave you an Uncle Frank
really worth your time and your talent,

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:29.885
I wonder if you would consider
putting that same time and talent

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.965
towards helping Mr. Lundbeck
and the picture?

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.448
Mmm.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.091
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.760
I'm Catrin Cole.
I'm one of the writers.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.607
Catrin, between us,
we'll have them weeping in the aisles.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.964
I need to let Ellis know
that I won't be there for his opening.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.170
I'll arrange a telegram.
The least we can do.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.883
Time and talent was good.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.210
Did you think of it beforehand?

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.329
His exhibition
only lasts two weeks.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.640
We'll have you back in London
before it closes.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.244
Damn!

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.442
- Here!
- Cheers.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.845
<i>Johnnie Lumb.</i>

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.291
Kent, England. You?

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.887
Brannigan. Made in America
and not for export.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.327
- So what are you doing here?
- Trying to get back.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.486
The propeller's snarled.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.889
If I can just cut it free...

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.531
Hurry, Uncle Frank.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.122
Oh!

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.681
Hey! Hey, there!

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.568
Uncle Frank?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.565
I dr... I dro... I dr...
I dropped the knife.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.761
William... Archie...

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.401
My... My boys.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.401
<i>Boys, such an age you've been gone.</i>

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.687
Why didn't you send word
you were still in France?

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.764
I could... I could
have fetched you home.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.640
I could... I could have
carried you both...

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.764
home.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.362
You're mustard these days,
aren't you?

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.924
- Night, Buckley.
- Night, Mrs. Cole.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.045
<i>- Pretty copper kettle.
- Such an age since...</i>

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.283
- Bright copper kettle.
- Been such an age since...

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.084
Pretty copper kettle,
bright copper kettle.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.929
There it is.
Dunkirk.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.642
Blimey. There's so many of us.
They'll never...

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.290
Mrs. Cole?

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.483
They'll never get us all out.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.289
Uh, where... Where is she?

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.125
- Thank you.
- Cut!

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.931
Could someone please get Mr. Hilliard
out of Dunkirk?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.082
- Find Mrs. Cole!
- Train ticket.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.050
Ration card.
Authorization to travel.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.536
Oh, don't be nervous.
Mr. Hilliard won't notice you're gone...

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.404
It's not Hilliard. It's Ellis.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.087
He's gonna be so disappointed in me
for missing the opening,

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.969
for not turning up till the last minute.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.362
Nonsense. Your husband
is a lucky man, Mrs. Cole.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.408
I'm sure he knows it.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.960
He's not my husband.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.611
I mean, he's not anyone else's either.
It's just...

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.685
We're not actually married.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.649
I bought the ring myself
in Woolworths.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.644
- I see.
- In love enough to run away with him.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:30.328
Just too proper not to care
what other people thought.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.006
- Er, behind...
- Better get moving.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.650
Hilliard's looking for you.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.936
Wants to discuss the stuff you wrote
for Uncle Frank's death.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.440
- What did you think?
- Too long, obviously.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.602
But apart from that...

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.920
His final moments,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.721
believing Brannigan and Johnnie
are the sons he lost in the last war...

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.087
- Well...
- Hmm.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.051
"Such an age you've been gone."

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.562
- Really.
- Hmm.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.567
I still think we need a little more
in terms of... of, um, of back-seeding.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.404
Oh, I'm... I'm awfully sorry,
Mr. Hilliard,

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.721
but Mrs. Cole has a train to catch.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.290
- What?
- She must go.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.691
- Wha...
- It's...

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.206
- It's a personal matter.
- Oh.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.442
Well, will she be back tonight?

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:16.490
- Let's get you into makeup.
- Hmm.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.847
You do look handsome in your sou'wester.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.843
Really?

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.649
Gin.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.529
Mr. Hilliard's going to be awfully angry.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.080
Oh, we'll blame war transport.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.522
The old ham can make do with me.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.246
So...

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.490
Positions! Positions!

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.086
Everybody please be quiet for a take.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.924
Don't stand under any thousand-pounders.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.644
The director wants
to speak to you.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.680
Let me guess. He's canceling my fitting
for the dog costume.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.524
No, he didn't say what it was about.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.523
Tell him you couldn't find me.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.569
But... But I <i>have</i> found you.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.290
No, you haven't.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.889
You are exhausted.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.486
You're leaning
against the rail of the ship,

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.087
the wounded Johnnie cradled...
cradled in your arms.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.731
Oh, uh, no, thank you.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.649
You look up,

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.441
and you see, coming
towards you across the deck,

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.569
a vision of loveliness.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.688
And you say...

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.651
Careful. The kid's pretty messed up.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.684
Careful. The kid's pretty messed up.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.651
He kept talking about some broad
called Nancy.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.042
Kept talking
about some broad called Nancy.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.600
I guess that must be you.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.841
I guess that must be you.

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:26.645
Okay.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.041
Action.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:39.563
Careful. The kid's pretty messed up.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.087
Kept talking
about some broad called Nancy.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.685
I guess that must be you.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.808
To which she replies...

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.484
Ooh.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.529
I'm Rose. This is Nancy.
The <i>Nancy.</i>

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.443
To which you say...

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.325
Rose...

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:03.406
Do you know, if one were 20 years younger
and differently inclined,

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.484
one might almost be tempted.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.611
Cat... Catrin...

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.725
Catrin!

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.201
Cat, don't make me run.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.001
They're always gonna be
like that, aren't they?

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.802
Younger, in awe of you, like I was.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.167
Oh, come on, Cat, you had a choice.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.326
You didn't choose me.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.606
I'll come back in a few days
and move my things.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.490
Oh, for God's sake, the flat's yours.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.087
You're the one who pays the rent.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.731
Anyway, I'm going
to Manchester tomorrow.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.723
They decided to take
the exhibition on tour.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.643
It's a success, then?

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.960
It's a success.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.326
I'm glad.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.611
Hmm.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.649
You know, the first time I painted you
outside the steelworks...

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.089
maybe I shouldn't have
shown you walking away.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.447
Oh, I don't know, Ellis.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.808
Maybe you just shouldn't have
made me so bloody small.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.482
Your ticket, madam.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.801
Safe journey. Next, please.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.406
War widows.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.331
- War widows.
- There you are.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.364
War widows.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.124
War widows.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.291

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.208
Likewise.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.163
So why didn't you stay?

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.322
You knew I'd cover for you.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.723
I was thinking
about what Mr. Hilliard said

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.724
about needing to back-seed
the death speech.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.131
Liar.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.804
Sorry.

Bomber's moon.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.530
Someone'll be copping it.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:50.961
So...

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.442
Another couple of days in Devon.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.883
London for the studio shoot.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.281
Then what?

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.208
Back to Careless Talk and carrots?

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.610
Don't know.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.245
Swain's talking about another feature.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.970
Air-raid wardens.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.689
There'll be slop.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.885
I don't know.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.247
Here.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.368
I'll get you a real desk.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.649
Marry you.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.211
What?

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.481
I'm already married.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.483
No, you're not.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.523
That was private.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.961
It was a private conversation.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.567
You had to buy the ring yourself
in Woolworths.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.803
When times got hard,
he tried to send you back to Wales,

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.929
and <i>he's</i> disappointed in <i>you?</i>

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.050
He's a stupid bloody fool,
but he's not as much of a fool as you.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.282
He changed your name, for Christ's sake!

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.002
Where's your fucking self-respect?

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.770
How dare you?

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.521
You have no one.
You don't know.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.126
- I know you deserve better.
<i>- You?</i>

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.850
You're the better?

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.288
Catrin... I... I...

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.170
I think... Look, I think you're mustard.

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:32.724
And I think...
you're a drunk, squalid bully.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.606
Come and get out of the water.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.045
Hush!

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.851
You were speaking
of Flight Lieutenant Lundbeck.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.605
Ah. You know he only did the film
under orders.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.496
"They told me it would be good

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.522
for Eagle Squadron recruitment, sir."

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.162
He's desperate to get back
in the air, poor boy.

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.890
- Tea, sir?
- Thank you.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.203
- Oh! Um... Oh, I...
- Thruppence, please.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.281
Please.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.964
There.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.520
Well, as long as you receive
an adequate coaching fee,

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.171
I see no objection to your continuing
to instruct him.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.322
- Fee?
- Yes. Certainly a fee.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.244
I shall be raising the matter
with Mr. Baker today.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.802
Is there anything else you wish me
to discuss with him?

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.087
Your dressing room is adequate?

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:45.006
Uh... Oh, your intimate needs
are being catered for?

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.003
Mmm?

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:52.291
Sammy once mentioned you do not like
to share studio facilities with crew.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.567
Electricians in particular?

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.247
Yes. Well, one mustn't complain.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.163
They do their best
to make one comfortable.

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.528
And as for the work, uh,
people...

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.366
People seem to be responding
rather well to Uncle Frank.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.365
I look... I look forward
to your opinion.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.729
Thank you.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.130
Sometimes one simply has to be firm.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.644
<i>Did you miss me?</i>

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.286
<i>You left your jacket in the cabin.</i>

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.931
<i>It smelt of you for the longest time.</i>

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.809
<i>And then one day, I went in there</i>

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.486
<i>and all I could smell
was Uncle Frank's pipe.</i>

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:41.286
<i>Only I'd understand, you know,</i>

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.771
<i>if things have changed.</i>

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.496
<i>And that bullet might have
had my name on it.</i>

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.170
<i>Oh, Johnnie.</i>

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.050
<i>I wouldn't blame you.
Brannigan</i> is <i>one in a million.</i>

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.566
<i>And I'm not much
to write home about, am I?</i>

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.371
<i>I'm just an everyday sort of bloke.</i>

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.727
<i>"Everyday.''</i>

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.931
<i>Every day for the rest of my life.</i>

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.285
Good work.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.000
Bloody good show,
what you've shot so far.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.769
When the film's been treated for color,
it's going to look marvelous.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.605
God, the American's teeth!
Can they be real?

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.047
If the studio shoot goes half as well,

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:24.010
this picture's going to be a triumph.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.004
There is, however,
one area of concern...

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.650
Memo, please.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.564
...from our American distributors.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:37.488
I'd ask you to absorb what's said
without derision, Buckley.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.962
"American picture-goers like
to be knocked off their feet.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.369
Bangs, crashes, ambulances
careening around corners.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.727
The same goes for romance.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:53.529
What you call understatement
translates as a lack of oomph."

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.761
The Americans feel that
the ending as presently written

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.251
is too subtly nuanced,

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.881
- too... restrained.
- Restrained?

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:06.724
I mean, it's practically a call to arms.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.725
Their concern is more
what one might crudely call

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.371
the love triangle.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.568
I have to say, as far as
the home front goes,

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.080
we can't let it look as if she'd rather
have had the American.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.810
Well, that'll be the teeth.

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.564
Teeth or no teeth,

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.644
what all parties need is a morally clean,

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:28.167
romantically satisfying resolution.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:36.050
Well, perhaps if Mrs. Cole could carry on
her good work with Hilliard on set,

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.806
Buckley and I could tackle
the new ending in the office.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.167
You'll enjoy the studio.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.571
Change of scene.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.483
Excellent. Excellent.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.047
Slowly forward.
Two steps.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.605
- Look to the side.
- Like this?

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:05.331
No, left side to the camera,
your good side,

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:08.927
and now raising your eyes
and turning as the Stuka...

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.447
Please, if you don't mind...
Stuka.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.644
Johnnie is hit!

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.047
Can you bring the light
over here? Thank you.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.360
Could you move, please?

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.044
We're trying to get big boy up there.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.327
- Sorry.
- Tea. Excuse me.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.051
- Coming through.
- Anyone for a cup of tea?

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.616
I thought that was
really rather convincing,

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.210
- don't you think?
- Very real.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:33.568
Oh, I say, are those rock cakes?

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.608
Ooh!

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.808
They want to know
when it'll be ready.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.042
<i>It's very much on its way.</i>

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.209
Only you keep saying that you'll be
sending over the new ending, but...

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:45.328
- It's almost ready.
<i>- Oh.</i>

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.925
Let me know when it is.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.123
<i>- Bye, Parfitt.</i>
- Mrs. Cole.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.566
Shall we find the lady
who'll do our makeup?

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:01.045
I suppose so.

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.445
It's coming over.
Mind your heads.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.005
Cigarette?

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.368
That's it. Okay, line it up, please.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.728
Line it up and keep it straight.
That's it.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.006
I've never much
seen the point in men.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.090
Still, I do hate to see you pining.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.003
Oh, I'm not pining.

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.526
Ellis moved out weeks ago.
I'm already used to it.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.170
It wasn't Ellis I was thinking of.

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.606
Forgive me.
It's just that...

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:43.243
When we were shooting in Devon,
you always seemed so... vivid.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.281
Perhaps I'm just
in a sentimental mood.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:54.721
My landlady was killed yesterday.

01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:00.762
I could hear her husband crying
through the wall all night long.

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.969
It seems to me when life
is so very precarious,

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.361
it's an awful shame to waste it.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:18.885
I was wondering.
On page 76, I say...

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.362
They're getting worried.
About the ending.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.642
Turned Ministry spy now?

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.849
Is that it?

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.560
Could I...

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.327
Sorry.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.210
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
- Don't bother.

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.567
It's not worth it.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.084
What do you think?

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.844
It's not very good.

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.131
It's not very... Buckley.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.487
It's not your fault, you know.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.403
It really isn't.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.443
You'd better go home, Mrs. Cole.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.965
<i>Exterior train. Station.</i>

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:20.367
<i>A full moon, a clear sky.</i>

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.963
<i>A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.</i>

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.566
<i>A woman is walking away from him.</i>

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.688
<i>Now she turns back.</i>

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.680
<i>"I didn't mean what I just said.</i>

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.361
And, anyway, you said worse."

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.609
It was a declaration.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.529
"Stupid bloody fool" was good.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.682
Did you think of that beforehand?

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:59.324
Are you trying to pick a fight
with me, Mrs. Cole?

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.084
No.

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:05.125
What I'm trying to say is that...

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.289
if all of this stopped...

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:14.530
the sparring and the jibing
and the insults and the arguments...

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.444
I'd miss it.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.450
Even if I were dead,

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.091
I'd still miss it.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.642
The Catrin Cole School of Dialogue.

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.121
On and on and on
and on and on.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.528
Lose half.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.688
- Which half?
- The half you don't need.

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.808
All right.

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:43.726
All right. I'd miss you.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:49.127
I'd miss you more than I can say.

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.684
Help me take this.

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:38.842
None on that side.
Keep going.

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:41.241
Let's go around this way.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:46.163
Mrs. Cole?

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.209
Watch yourself, girl.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.681
- Mrs. Cole?
- Hmm?

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:05.481
- I thought you was under it.
- I was in the office.

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.891
Hmm.

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.249
Okay, coming in from the left.

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:25.445
I might have to borrow clothes.

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.241
Talk to the costumes mistress,
but don't be surprised if she's tetchy.

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:32.130
A parachute mine took the roof
off Studio Four last night

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.885
and her Panzer division uniforms
are ruined.

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.122
They're saying it was
the worst night of bombing yet.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.168
Nothing left of Wimbledon, apparently.

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.971
The props master hasn't turned up,
the best boy's in hospital,

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.610
and no one knows where the grip is,

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.762
so we're having to make do
with whatever we can get.

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:48.650
It's got a bit of a wobble.
Might have to lash it to the gantry.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.848
There'll be tears before bedtime,
mark my words.

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.285
No, you've got a bit of a wobble.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.164
Chick.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.004
Could we save that lamp
till we roll, please?

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.208
Sorry, Mr. Hilliard.
It's heavy.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.616
- More?
- Much more.

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.928
This man hasn't had a bath
since the last time he fell off the boat.

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.088
Change of plans.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.924
Going straight
from Uncle Frank's Mayday

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.401
to wounded Johnnie
fixing the propeller.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.403
Hurry up, Rex.
We need you over here.

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:17.528
Yes, sir. Coming.
Quick as I can.

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.409
Right, what can I do for you, sir?

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.843
Right, be careful. Careful.

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:31.651
And watch out for that...
Watch the wires, please.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:35.167
- I thought you'd be at the office.
- Don't lean against it.

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.126
I was.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.210
I read your ending.

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.290
You bagged it.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.803
- You were almost there.
- Nowhere near.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.724
I've been useless for weeks.

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.167
I read your other stuff, too.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.602
Oh?

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.331
- What did you think?
- Hmm.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.564
Bit inconclusive. I wasn't really sure
where it was going next.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.605
No.

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:34.690
I wasn't too sure of that, either.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:44.447
Crumbs.

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:01.048
Find Mrs. Cole!
I need to talk to Mrs. Cole.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.724
Mrs. Cole!

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.326
Has anyone seen Mrs. Cole?

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.888
- Come on before they find us.
- Where?

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:10.883
I don't know. I never come to the studio.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.291
Mrs. Cole!

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.170
The boss wants to try a take
without Uncle Frank's lines

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:24.562
'cause he says
we are losing visual tension.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.723
Mr. Hilliard is talking about
the integrity of the story,

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:32.328
saying he will play the scene
as you wrote it or not at all.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.530
- Nobody's had any sleep and you're just...
- It's all right. I'm coming.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.081
No. Let me deal with it.

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.602
Once Hilliard gets his hands on you,
he won't let you go for hours,

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:54.083
and I was rather hoping to do that myself.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.605
Careful of big boy,

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.560
it's got a bit of a wobble on it.

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:00.642
Don't... Don't lean against it.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.129
- Whoa! Nobody move!
- Buckley!

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.167
Nobody move, stay exactly where
you are until we have some lights in here.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.004
Stay where you are.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.362
Back. Back, please.
Everybody get back.

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.846
Please take the girls
away from the stage.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.729
Mr. Brown, please take them away.

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.043
<i>Almost dawn.</i>

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.805
<i>Johnnie has been doing
his best to fix the engine,</i>

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.848
<i>but he is getting weaker by the minute.</i>

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:30.400
<i>And we all know
when the sun comes up,</i>

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.687
<i>the German planes will be back.</i>

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.044
<i>Oh!</i>

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.883
No one wants to be here,

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:54.167
but we have a hole in this picture.

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.288
A stranded boat,
a broken propeller,

01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:59.204
no one to fix it,
and no Tom Buckley.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:04.490
- Well, maybe we could reshoot.
- Who with?

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.166
Ambrose Hilliard is still in plaster,

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.686
Wyndham Best's
in the North Atlantic,

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:13.162
and Carl Lundbeck
is back with the RAF.

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:16.011
Could one of the Frenchies do it?

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.129
Come to our rescue,
same way we came to theirs?

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:22.363
It doesn't seem right morale-wise.

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.927
We could, uh, pan across
the faces of the soldiers

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.128
and never actually see who fixes...

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:32.409
<i>The work's good, Mrs. Cole.</i>

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.361
None of them
could have done any better.

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.522
You're mustard these days.

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.729
Rose could do it.

01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:57.641
Rose could free the propeller.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.082
Cerberus, sit.

01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:19.366
Rugelach...

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:23.689
- and <i>kogel mogel.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.128
To build you up in time
for the premiere.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:39.164
You'll be interested to learn I received
several unexpected propositions this week.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.370
How delightful for you.

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.444
Of course, I do not speak
of erotic advances.

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.286
These were professional inquiries
regarding your availability.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.081
You will be kind enough to read,
give your opinion.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.807
The doctors tell me you are
to be discharged in a few days.

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:05.727
I cannot see you will be in a condition
to look after yourself. I...

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:12.165
I therefore propose that we should ready
a room in the apartment for your use.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.843
I believe a few weeks' proper care
will be of great benefit...

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.606
to your career.

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:23.445
You're still a very handsome man,
Mr. Hilliard.

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.204
Yes.

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:29.649
But your good looks have fallen prey
to a certain scrawniness.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.122
Oh, no, we can correct this,
I believe, together.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.216
Thank you, Mr. Hilliard.

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.416
This way, Mr. Hilliard.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.688
Young ladies, thank you.

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.330
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.006
I'm not concerned
about how many lines I have.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.730
I'd rather have four honest words

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.416
- than 50 pages of bilge.
- Wyndham Best.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.771
Young lady.

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:56.081
Remarkably good turnout.
Mr. Frayle.

01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:01.601
- Hello. Did you... Is this...
- Yes.

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:03.284
Congratulations.
Well done.

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.601
- Good evening.
- Miss Moore. Very ship shape.

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.409
- Why, thank you.
- Hello.

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.084
Let me do this.

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:12.607
Mrs. Cole? She's coming?

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:13.966
I tried.

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:27.204
Oh, Miss Pugh,
your uncle's here to see you.

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:37.565
Forgive the deceit.

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:40.723
Your landlady didn't look the sort
to approve a gentleman caller.

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:44.056
To be perfectly frank, she's the first
person I've met for weeks

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.445
who didn't recognize me.

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.808
She doesn't hold
with the pictures. Ungodly.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.729
Ah!

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.242
That's...
That's charming.

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:05.402
It's from Rose and Lily.

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:07.721
The real Rose and Lily.

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:09.325
They ran away to join the ATS.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:13.689
Rose thought if she could fix
a propeller in a film,

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.331
she could learn to mend
an engine in real life.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.124
Ah.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.168
They're both mechanics now.

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:23.770
Um...

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:33.844
Baker's planning a new film.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.925
Air-raid wardens.
Wants me in it.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.606
He's pretty much left the part up to me.

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:45.720
So, I was thinking,
newly retired cat burglar,

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:49.247
not quite reformed.
That's why he's so good at the rescues.

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.891
He knows the way in and out
of any property.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.810
Thing is, in the hands
of the wrong writer...

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:00.924
So, I was wondering

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.368
if you would consider putting
your time and talent...

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.249
I don't do that anymore.

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.960
I'm sorry. I just can't.

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:32.887
You'll get... You'll get soap in your eyes.

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.444
Here.

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.725
Hmm.

01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.529
My agent's.

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:06.960
You and me, given opportunities
only because young men are gone.

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.725
Or dying.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:15.564
But to turn our back
on those opportunities,

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:20.567
even when one has suffered
such great loss,

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.328
wouldn't that be giving death
dominion over life?

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:42.287
Have you seen it yet?
Our film?

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:45.921
You should.
It's very good.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.810
I'm awfully good.

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:53.045
And so are you.

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.125
<i>Calling all small boats.</i>

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:12.285
<i>All seaworthy vessels to report
to your local harbor master immediately.</i>

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.488
<i>Dunkirk. Oh, Lily!</i>

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.801
<i>I think they're gonna get 'em out.</i>

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.646
<i>Then they're going to need
all the boats they can get, aren't they?</i>

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.643
<i>The Nancy.</i>

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.564
<i>Here, boy.</i>

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.688
<i>Here.</i>

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:31.816
<i>Don't be a fool, Johnnie.</i>

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.171
<i>There's a sniper up there.</i>

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.776
<i>I don't care if he's got
a bleedin' cannon.</i>

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.640
<i>I'm not gonna sit by
and watch him shoot a dog.</i>

01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.081
Aww!

01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:01.603
<i>What in the... What is that?</i>

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:03.842
<i>It's France, Uncle Frank.</i>

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.811
<i>Dunkirk.</i>

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:10.049
<i>Blimey.
There's so many of us.</i>

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:12.202
<i>They'll never get us all out.</i>

01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:19.091
<i>Hitler? Hitler?</i>

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:22.164
<i>Who the bleedin' hell
does he think he is?</i>

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.696
Who the bleeding heck

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:24.767
do you think you are?

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.080
Who do you think you are?

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:35.324
<i>Johnnie!</i>

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:42.849
<i>That's it. There you go.</i>

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.764
<i>Thank you, Grandad.
You deserve a medal, mate.</i>

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.047
<i>Johnnie.</i>

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.889
<i>- Johnnie. Johnnie.
- Careful.</i>

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.803
<i>The kid's pretty messed up.</i>

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.248
<i>He kept talking
about some broad called Nancy.</i>

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.488
<i>I guess that must be you.</i>

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:14.689
<i>I'm Rose. This is the Nancy.</i>

01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.566
<i>Rose.</i>

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:25.922
<i>The propeller's snarled.</i>

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:30.443
<i>If I... If I can just cut it free...</i>

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.242
<i>Just pretend you're Errol Flynn.
He can do anything.</i>

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.449
<i>I've cut it free.</i>

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.448
<i>She's moving.</i>

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.003
<i>Come on, you beauty.</i>

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:21.970
She'll do it.

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:39.161
<i>I haven't had the chance to thank you,
Mr. Brannigan, for bringing Johnnie back.</i>

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:42.921
<i>There's no mister, and back home,
they call me Gene.</i>

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.844
<i>- Thank you, Gene.</i>
- Thank you, Gene.

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:48.082
<i>Tell me one thing.</i>

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:50.447
<i>In another time, another place,</i>

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.409
<i>could it have been me?</i>

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.451
<i>Perhaps, but you're talking
about a world without Johnnie.</i>

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.091
<i>And that's not a world
I'd care to live in.</i>

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:13.963
<i>Have you ever looked at something
and known you want it,</i>

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.089
<i>want it more than anything
you've ever wanted in your life before,</i>

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:18.924
<i>and known that it can never be yours?</i>

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.042
<i>I have, and I tell you,</i>

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.481
<i>it'll either finish you
or put a fire in your belly</i>

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:29.086
<i>that'll keep burning
to the end of your days.</i>

01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:35.370
<i>I wasn't there at the beginning
of the story,</i>

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.649
<i>but you can bet your bottom dollar
I'm not leaving before the end.</i>

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:42.930
<i>Because I know now that it has to be
the right sort of ending.</i>

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:47.605
<i>The sort of ending
that's worth fighting for.</i>

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.846
Miss.

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.405
Oh.

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.209
Wanna stay and watch it again?

01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:21.523
You'll find more in to make you laugh
second time round.

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.568
I've seen it five times.

01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:28.123
It's our picture, isn't it?
They're our girls.

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.364
Thanks, but I'd better get back to work.

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.642
What's work?

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:40.371
Air-raid wardens.

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.451
- They want an outline.
- We haven't got a story yet.

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:57.730
And they're asking about characters,
apart from Hilliard as a cat burglar.

01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.928
Three girls,
three different walks of life.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.126
I need specifics.

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.123
A nun, a showgirl,
a lady wrestler.

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:05.885
Seriously, you push us now,
and that's what you'll get.

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:07.041
Men?

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:09.441
Well, who else are the girls
gonna fall in love with?

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:12.490
- Each other?
- We've got titles.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:15.763
<i>Raiders Overhead. Fires Overhead.
Fire in the Sky.</i>

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.842
They are looking
for the female angle again.

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.287
<i>A Tin Hat for Tallulah.</i>

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.767
<i>- Girls Like Them?
- Girls Like You.</i>

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:24.171
<i>Girls Like Us?</i>

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.567
- You need an ending.
- We're working on it.

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.970
Make it a happy one.

01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:40.441
It will be.
