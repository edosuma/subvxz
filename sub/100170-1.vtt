It's quite precious to me.

Well, he doesn't have any ID
and he's not in the system,

16:08.541 --> 16:12.125
so I thought I'd let him crash down
at the station till his memory comes back.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.250
I hit him with my car.

-This is all my fault.
-No.

16:18.625 --> 16:22.041
There is no fault, and no need
for me to crash at the station.

I don't think that's a good idea.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.083
It will be fine.

16:35.416 --> 16:38.416
Besides, I'll feel a whole lot better
knowing he's safe

16:38.500 --> 16:40.208

until his memory comes back.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.833

Modern technology is lit AF.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.875
Well, it sounds
like your memory's coming back.

29:06.083 --> 29:08.083
I had the opportunity
to study your dialect

29:08.166 --> 29:09.916
with the pictures on your magic box.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.500
It is most informal and nonsensical.

29:12.791 --> 29:15.583
For instance,
how is it permissible to call one's friend

29:15.666 --> 29:18.541
mom, dad, king, queen,
babes, sis, bro or bae?

29:21.000 --> 29:23.500
And by the looks of it,
you've become quite the binge-watcher.

29:24.916 --> 29:28.875
Well, if that means captivated
by these picture boxes, then yes.

29:32.666 --> 29:34.708
What say you and I binge-watch together?

29:36.916 --> 29:37.791
Come hither.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.250
[Brooke chuckles]

29:39.375 --> 29:42.125
I don't know. I have so many
Christmas chores I have to get done.

30:10.125 --> 30:11.416
[Cole yawns]

30:19.958 --> 30:22.333
Sherwyn, you came back.

30:25.583 --> 30:26.833
[horse neighs]

30:27.791 --> 30:30.250
Remember, you have until midnight,

30:30.333 --> 30:32.541
the eve of Christmas
to fulfill your quest.

30:32.625 --> 30:35.916
I'm well aware, Old Crone.
What exactly is my quest?

30:36.000 --> 30:39.708
Open your eyes.
You'll find it right in front of you.

30:40.166 --> 30:41.333
But they are open.

30:42.125 --> 30:46.541
All will become clear
when you learn to open you heart.

30:46.916 --> 30:50.458
Stop talking in riddles, Old Crone.
What does that mean?

30:50.625 --> 30:51.791
[Old Crone laughs]

30:54.250 --> 30:55.166
Sherwyn!

30:55.875 --> 30:57.958
-My sword.
-Are you okay?

31:02.583 --> 31:04.833
I fear I must have had
a wicked night terror.

31:06.416 --> 31:07.916
So much for one more episode.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.916
Man, I'm aiming for a much more
productive day ahead.

31:13.416 --> 31:14.625
Indeed.

31:27.833 --> 31:29.083
Oh. Hum...

31:29.416 --> 31:30.291
[Brooke chuckles]

31:30.416 --> 31:32.958
Those were my mom's
special Christmas decorations.

31:36.166 --> 31:38.250
I haven't been able to open it. Just...

31:39.041 --> 31:39.875
[Brooke sighs]

31:39.958 --> 31:40.916
so many memories.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.041
I moved home after she got sick,

31:45.125 --> 31:48.333
and my dad passed away
a few months after she did.

31:52.166 --> 31:53.125
I'm sorry.

31:55.750 --> 32:00.500
You know, I... I haven't seen my mother or
father since I was sent away as a squire.

32:02.416 --> 32:04.750
But I carry them and...

32:05.875 --> 32:07.250
all my memories here.

32:12.041 --> 32:13.458
Maybe it's time I opened it up.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.458
[Brooke softly gasps]

32:22.791 --> 32:24.708
Mr. Ginger Snaps.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.125
[Brooke chuckles]

32:30.541 --> 32:32.041
You know, every year my mom would make

32:32.125 --> 32:35.000
a little something special for me
to find under the Christmas tree,

32:35.083 --> 32:39.416
like a handmade broach
or a knitted pillow doll.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.125
Half the fun was just
finding it hidden in the branches.

32:44.416 --> 32:46.291
You know, my mother was also a seamstress.

32:47.541 --> 32:48.958
She made all our clothes.

32:50.208 --> 32:51.916
Sounds like our moms
would have gotten along.

32:55.708 --> 32:59.333
You said that you
were knighted by King Edward III.

33:00.291 --> 33:02.833
He ruled in the 1300s.

33:03.875 --> 33:06.458
A most formidable and admired king.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.833
Do you know what year it is?

33:10.916 --> 33:13.125
The picture box said it's 2019.

33:14.916 --> 33:17.541
The sun rises every morn,

33:17.916 --> 33:20.250
and the moon dies
only to be reborn each month,

33:20.333 --> 33:22.500
and it does so
whether I understand them or not.

33:24.333 --> 33:27.916
I have traveled here,
and it matters not if I understand how.

33:28.500 --> 33:32.666
But you know time travel
isn't a real thing, right?

33:33.625 --> 33:37.041
In the 1300s or now in 2019.

33:37.416 --> 33:41.166
Well, by that logic, only things
that you comprehend are possible.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.208
Well, I suppose you're right.

33:49.833 --> 33:51.125
I'm sorry, Sir Cole.

33:52.916 --> 33:53.916
You know...

33:56.666 --> 34:00.041
you really don't need
to call me Sir Cole anymore.

34:01.291 --> 34:03.375
But I thought it was a term of respect.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.125
Oh, it is.

34:06.958 --> 34:09.083
Formalities can cease now that we're...

34:10.583 --> 34:11.458
more familiar.

34:14.208 --> 34:15.750
Well, okay then, Cole.

34:21.416 --> 34:23.250
What might this mutilated mess be?

34:23.625 --> 34:25.000
It's my Christmas tree.

34:25.583 --> 34:26.958
We just have to set it up.

34:28.250 --> 34:31.166
It's as contrived as the creatures
that adorn your cottage.

34:31.250 --> 34:33.625
Take me to the forest.
I will show you a real tree.

34:35.458 --> 34:36.333
Fine.

34:36.791 --> 34:38.791
[Christmas song playing]

34:42.250 --> 34:45.666
Where I come from,
we adorn the tree with candles and fruit.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.250
Then come Christmas morn,

34:47.416 --> 34:50.833
my brother and I would awake to find an
orange and a halfpenny on our bedclothes.

34:50.916 --> 34:54.458
Orange and a halfpenny?
Guess no need for a gift receipt.

34:54.541 --> 34:57.875
When I turned seven,
I apprenticed as a page boy.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.083
I was fortunate Lord Ganley
was kind enough to allow me

35:00.166 --> 35:01.708
to return home at Christmas each year.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.500
-It must have been hard.
-It was all I knew.

35:04.833 --> 35:06.833
Then at the age of 14, I became a squire

35:06.916 --> 35:10.333
and was sent to Lord Townsend's castle
until the age of 21 when I was knighted.

35:11.333 --> 35:12.958
Ah, this one looks hearty.

35:13.541 --> 35:16.208
Yeah, it does.
I'll get one of the employees to help.

35:16.291 --> 35:17.291
Nonsense.

35:18.041 --> 35:19.500
What fun is fetching a Christmas tree

35:19.583 --> 35:21.583
if you allow someone else
to do all of the fetching?

35:22.166 --> 35:23.041
Oh.

35:23.541 --> 35:24.458
[Brooke chuckles]

35:29.041 --> 35:30.375
-[soft hit]
-Oh!

35:31.166 --> 35:32.041
[Cole laughs]

35:32.458 --> 35:33.916
If he can do it, I can do it.

35:36.250 --> 35:37.083
Nice.

35:38.083 --> 35:39.166
-Oh!
-[woman laughs]

35:39.750 --> 35:40.708
You see that?

35:49.583 --> 35:50.416
Brooke...

35:51.416 --> 35:53.791
Might I ask you a personal question

35:54.083 --> 35:56.916
regarding your dalliance with the douche?

35:57.708 --> 35:58.666
James?

35:58.875 --> 36:00.416
Well, just how serious was it?

36:00.750 --> 36:02.791
Because if he broke your
betrothal and ruined you,

36:02.875 --> 36:04.833
I believe it is my quest
to see him run through.

36:05.416 --> 36:08.458
No. He is not worth it.

36:10.041 --> 36:12.166
Truth is I kind of knew he wasn't the one.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.416
I just kept hanging around, hoping

36:14.500 --> 36:16.541
he would grow
into the man I wanted him to be.

36:17.583 --> 36:19.583
But he caused you great distress.

36:19.666 --> 36:23.750
Two years.
I tried everything but it wasn't enough.

36:24.250 --> 36:27.666
Well, might I say he was a boiled-brained
cod piece to choose any other over you.

36:27.750 --> 36:30.083
I... haven't heard that one before,

36:30.833 --> 36:32.750
but... thanks.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.833
A knight speaks the truth at all times.

36:38.125 --> 36:41.541
Brooke, I was wondering if you might
be so gallant as to lend me your steed.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.208
My car?

36:44.041 --> 36:44.875
Hum...

36:45.083 --> 36:47.041
So, you remember how to drive?

36:47.583 --> 36:48.500
Certainly.

36:49.125 --> 36:51.208
I've tamed all sorts of beasts in my day.

36:51.333 --> 36:52.208
[Cole grunts]

36:53.250 --> 36:54.500
Yours is no different.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.958
Well, okay, I guess.

36:59.583 --> 37:01.166
Do you know where you're going?

37:02.041 --> 37:05.041
Not exactly,
but I'm determined to find out.

37:16.666 --> 37:17.666
[Brooke exhales]

37:30.458 --> 37:33.291
Yeah, you-- I don't think
you need the windshield wipers.

37:33.708 --> 37:34.541
Got it.

37:35.041 --> 37:36.041
[Cole cleans throat]

37:40.041 --> 37:40.958
[honks]

37:41.458 --> 37:43.583
Are you sure you remember how to drive?

37:44.458 --> 37:45.458
Yes, just warming up.

38:00.166 --> 38:02.916
He'll be fine. It's fine.

38:36.416 --> 38:37.333
Old Crone.

38:39.416 --> 38:40.916
Begging your pardon, my lady.

38:42.875 --> 38:46.291
Hey, buddy. Can you maybe
stop calling my wife an "Old Crone?"

38:48.041 --> 38:49.250
You look at little lost.

38:49.541 --> 38:51.833
Indeed. I fear I'm no close
to becoming a true knight

38:51.916 --> 38:53.625
than I was before the Crone sent me here.

38:54.291 --> 38:55.125
Crone?

38:55.458 --> 38:57.833
A wise woman that presents herself
in various disguises

38:57.916 --> 38:59.166
to test the heart of knights.

38:59.250 --> 39:01.958
You must be one of those method actors.
You really get into our roles.

39:02.708 --> 39:05.208
Well, a knight is always pure of heart.

39:05.666 --> 39:09.750
Alas, I fear I am no close to achieving
my quest than I was the moment I got here.

39:11.666 --> 39:14.750
I'd like to say
that it's the joy of Christmas

39:14.833 --> 39:18.375
that reminds us of the faith we need
to sustain us throughout the year.

39:18.916 --> 39:21.500
You know? Failure only happens
when you give up.

39:22.125 --> 39:26.291
With hope and determination,
well, they fuel champions.

39:30.875 --> 39:31.708
Verily.

39:33.833 --> 39:36.125
Thank you for your wise counsel,
Father Christmas.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.291
My pleasure.

39:43.666 --> 39:44.750
Damn, I'm good.

39:49.333 --> 39:52.125
- [kids shouting in excitement]
- Merry Christmas! Let's see those lists!

39:52.625 --> 39:54.958
-What? Oh, my gosh, there's so many.
-Yay! He's here!

40:11.625 --> 40:13.041
Oh, good Lord.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.375
Cole.

40:16.833 --> 40:21.375
Cole. Officer Stevens said he found my car
abandoned on Main Street. What happened?

40:21.458 --> 40:22.416
Are you okay?

40:22.875 --> 40:24.083
Alas, I...

40:24.791 --> 40:27.125
fear I'm yet to discover my true quest.

40:28.458 --> 40:33.625
What, as in fighting dragons
or pulling magic swords out of the stone?

40:34.000 --> 40:35.833
I fear you've watched
far too many pictures

40:35.916 --> 40:37.541
on your magic box that makes merry.

40:42.041 --> 40:44.875
A knight's true quest
challenges his innermost weakness.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.500
Well, then what is your weakness?

40:51.541 --> 40:54.291
I say this with you,
my lady, I do not know.

40:54.375 --> 40:57.083
And I have only until
midnight Christmas Eve.

40:58.833 --> 41:01.041
You know, growing up,
my father used to say,

41:01.125 --> 41:04.625
you can achieve anything in life
if you want it badly enough.

41:08.208 --> 41:09.916
Brooke, it is my sincerest vow.

41:11.708 --> 41:13.666
I want this more than anything in life.

41:14.875 --> 41:17.541
Then you have
nothing to worry about, Cole.

41:18.083 --> 41:19.958
Christmas is still five days away

41:20.041 --> 41:23.625
and I have no doubt
you will achieve your goal.

41:27.166 --> 41:29.125
Your faith is much appreciated.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.500
Come on, let's go home.

41:34.375 --> 41:36.166
Well, in that case, I...

41:36.875 --> 41:39.500
best give you the reins to your steed.

41:39.583 --> 41:42.208
I fear she's the loyal type
who answers only to you.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.416
Good thinking.

41:53.541 --> 41:55.333
That cannot be my England.

41:55.583 --> 41:57.791
It's a live-stream view
of the Tower of London.

41:58.333 --> 42:00.916
That's an extraordinarily
large number of prisoners.

42:01.375 --> 42:04.458
No, they're not prisoners.
They're tourists.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.875
It's an attraction now.
People pay money to have a look around.

42:10.916 --> 42:12.375
Honestly, what next?

42:12.583 --> 42:13.541
[Brooke laughs]

42:14.666 --> 42:15.833
Just hold that thought.

42:16.666 --> 42:19.541
-Hello.
-Hello. Are these for me?

42:19.708 --> 42:22.083
-Yeah.
-They're beautiful. Thank you.

42:22.166 --> 42:24.250
Yeah, so we would have
brought you some cookies,

42:24.333 --> 42:26.958
but someone decided
to share them with half the neighborhood.

42:28.083 --> 42:30.458
Well, that is what Christmas is all about.

42:31.291 --> 42:32.541
Are you really a knight?

42:32.916 --> 42:34.166
Aye. I am.

42:34.250 --> 42:35.708
Can girls be knights?

42:35.791 --> 42:36.791
-No.
-Yes.

42:38.083 --> 42:40.500
Girls can be whatever they wanna be.

42:40.958 --> 42:44.250
Cool. Will you teach me
how to swordfight with a real sword?

42:44.791 --> 42:47.958
I don't think so. You're too young
and it's too dangerous.

42:48.458 --> 42:49.541
Well, fear not.

42:49.791 --> 42:51.791
When I was her age,
we used to learn to fight

42:51.875 --> 42:54.958
with sticks of wood
to avoid serious injury to life or limb.

42:56.416 --> 42:59.916
Well, who is ready to get
this tree-trimming party in order?

43:00.000 --> 43:00.833
-Yes.
-Me.

43:00.916 --> 43:01.750
Let's go.

43:01.875 --> 43:03.041
[both laughing]

43:03.291 --> 43:07.500
Your grandma and grandpa
picked this up on their trip to Aldovia.

43:08.625 --> 43:10.083
-Okay.
-[Cole cleans throat]

43:10.291 --> 43:12.041
How is this?

43:12.583 --> 43:14.333
She's leaning a little far to the right.

43:17.291 --> 43:18.125
No.

43:19.666 --> 43:21.166
That's perfect.

43:22.625 --> 43:26.791
Aside from the fact that he believes
that he's a knight from the 14th century,

43:27.166 --> 43:29.250
I'd say Cole's the whole package.

43:29.833 --> 43:30.666
Yeah.

43:31.625 --> 43:35.041
No, but he-- He is pretty convincing.

43:35.750 --> 43:37.500
I'm sure once he gets his memory back,

43:37.583 --> 43:40.708
we'll figure out that
he's just a medieval enthusiast.

43:40.791 --> 43:41.791
[Brooke chuckles]

43:48.666 --> 43:50.083
I don't know, Mads.

43:51.833 --> 43:55.083
What if Cole really is who he says he is?

43:55.583 --> 43:58.708
Like what if there are things
beyond our comprehension?

43:59.416 --> 44:01.166
What do you mean, like time travel?

44:03.750 --> 44:06.458
Then I would say you both
need to get your heads examined.

44:06.541 --> 44:07.458
[Brooke sighs]

44:10.500 --> 44:12.708
I will say this about the guy...

44:13.750 --> 44:15.791
he is very sweet and charming.

44:16.208 --> 44:17.166
Yeah, I'd say.

44:18.750 --> 44:21.458
We sure could use a whole lot
more Coles in this world.

44:22.208 --> 44:23.375
I will drink to that.

44:23.458 --> 44:24.625
-Cheers.
-[both chuckle]

44:26.625 --> 44:27.458
Now remember,

44:27.791 --> 44:30.125
always defend and protect your weak side.

44:34.791 --> 44:38.416
Okay, kiddo.
Time to say good night to the good knight.

44:40.041 --> 44:41.541
-Thank you.
-No.

44:42.708 --> 44:43.583
Good night.

44:48.958 --> 44:50.125
{\an8}That's called a fist bump.

44:50.583 --> 44:53.875
Yes, but we knights shake hands
to prove we're weapon-free.

44:56.958 --> 44:59.125
-Good night. I love you.
-Love you, too.

44:59.541 --> 45:01.125
-Good night.
-Good night.

45:02.166 --> 45:03.666
-Good night.
-Good night.

45:16.875 --> 45:17.833
[blade cutting air]

45:20.625 --> 45:21.625
[soft thud]

45:26.625 --> 45:29.500
Excuse me. Who started this fight?

45:33.833 --> 45:37.458
Apologies, my lady Brooke.
I came out to get a little sparring in

45:37.541 --> 45:39.416
and it appears I got
a little bit carried away.

45:39.500 --> 45:40.500
Yeah, you think?

45:40.583 --> 45:42.666
Looks like we've
got some cleaning up to do.

45:43.875 --> 45:45.166
I wouldn't mind helping.

45:47.083 --> 45:49.583
Of course not. Hi.

45:49.666 --> 45:52.208
Hi. What do we have here?

45:52.666 --> 45:53.625
Oh. Hum...

45:53.750 --> 45:56.958
Well, Cole is one of the cosplay knights
at the Christmas Castle

45:57.041 --> 45:59.291
and was just practicing his routine.

45:59.541 --> 46:00.375
Good morn.

46:01.375 --> 46:04.083
-Cole, this is my neighbor, Allyson.
-Charmed.

46:04.625 --> 46:05.583
A pleasure.

46:05.666 --> 46:07.791
Actually, I just popped by
to see if you're free tonight

46:07.875 --> 46:09.666
to do some
Christmas caroling with friends.

46:11.583 --> 46:14.333
While the-- It is an honor,

46:14.416 --> 46:18.916
I must respectfully decline,
as I'm previously committed.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.166
Ah. Well,

46:21.083 --> 46:22.291
another time, perhaps?

46:23.208 --> 46:24.083
Perhaps.

46:24.583 --> 46:25.583
Okay.

46:27.750 --> 46:29.125
-Bye.
-Bye.

46:29.333 --> 46:30.833
-See you.
-Toodle-pip.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.291
[Brooke steps heavily]

46:35.708 --> 46:38.166
Lady Allyson seems
to have you green with envy.

46:38.625 --> 46:41.000
Okay. First off, she ain't no lady.

46:41.125 --> 46:43.333
In high school,
she was voted Biggest Flirt.

46:44.166 --> 46:46.833
Trust me, she's no damsel in distress.

46:47.291 --> 46:50.125
And yet, she distresses
the damsel before me,

46:50.875 --> 46:52.875
which is why I declined her invitation.

46:53.416 --> 46:55.416
Since when are you previously committed?

46:56.166 --> 46:59.041
Well, the moment a kind and fair maiden
opened her doors to me.

47:02.333 --> 47:03.750
The scoundrel James did--

47:04.500 --> 47:05.708
How would you put it?

47:06.541 --> 47:09.000
Really did a number
on your self-esteem, babe.

47:10.000 --> 47:10.958
[Brooke chuckles]

47:12.625 --> 47:14.833
I don't know about that, but...

47:16.250 --> 47:18.375
I mean, I guess I did walk away

47:18.458 --> 47:20.666
with a few trust issues,
but how could I not?

47:21.083 --> 47:22.541
A knight always keeps faith.

47:23.458 --> 47:24.583
It's part of our code.

47:25.208 --> 47:26.791
What else is part of your knight's code?

47:28.208 --> 47:30.500
A knight is sworn to valor and virtue.

47:31.583 --> 47:34.500
His blade defends the good,
and his might upholds the weak.

47:34.625 --> 47:36.458
His temper shall be led by patience

47:36.625 --> 47:39.208
and his kindness
will give aid to those who seek it.

47:40.791 --> 47:42.000
{\an8}I have a favor to ask.

47:42.083 --> 47:44.083
I'm going to need
as much help as I can get

47:44.166 --> 47:45.875
to pull off this year's
Christmas Eve feast.

47:45.958 --> 47:46.791
You in?

47:47.250 --> 47:48.208
Indeed.

47:49.541 --> 47:51.458
I'm at your service day or night.

47:52.541 --> 47:54.250
Thanks for watching the little ones.

47:54.333 --> 47:57.375
Oh, anytime. Excited to see
how the feast comes together.

47:57.458 --> 47:58.291
Same here.

47:58.750 --> 48:00.916
Will, Lily, behavior yourselves.

48:02.541 --> 48:05.458
Hey kids, come on in soon
for some hot chocolate.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.833
Where are your gloves?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.541
They don't keep my hands warm.

48:11.958 --> 48:13.916
Can't you ask your dad
to buy you new ones?

48:14.958 --> 48:17.375
He gets really sad
when we ask for new things.

48:18.791 --> 48:21.375
Here. You can have these. I have others.

48:21.791 --> 48:22.625
I can?

48:23.875 --> 48:24.875
Thanks.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.458
<i>[Cole] So, how did this</i>
<i>charity event get started?</i>

48:30.541 --> 48:34.166
<i>[Brooke] </i> As a kid, my mom and dad
hosted a Christmas Eve dinner each year

48:34.375 --> 48:36.750
for friends and family
with nowhere else to go.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.708
After they passed away,
I wanted to keep the tradition alive.

48:41.291 --> 48:42.500
How altruistic.

48:42.916 --> 48:45.583
Well, Christmas
is about giving back, right?

48:45.666 --> 48:48.000
So, as the event continued to grow,

48:48.083 --> 48:51.166
we started selling tickets
to donate profits to those in need.

48:52.333 --> 48:54.291
-Hello.
-Oh, Eileen.

48:54.375 --> 48:56.333
Please tell me that's what I think it is.

48:56.416 --> 48:58.125
Yes, my homemade peppermint bark.

48:58.208 --> 49:02.083
And I made so much this year,
Fred suggested I rent a cement mixer.

49:02.208 --> 49:03.208
[both laugh]

49:03.375 --> 49:06.458
Where is Fred?
He's normally a staple at these events.

49:06.541 --> 49:08.125
Yeah, he pulled his back,

49:08.333 --> 49:10.291
and nothing seems
to be relieving the pain.

49:10.375 --> 49:11.958
I swear we've tried everything.

49:12.041 --> 49:14.833
Try wrapping his haunch bone
against a hot cloth.

49:15.208 --> 49:16.333
Hot as he can bear it.

49:16.791 --> 49:20.958
Then add a healthy dose
of boiled red ox gall, pork fat and cumin.

49:21.875 --> 49:22.958
Except that.

49:23.041 --> 49:25.375
Eileen, this is Cole. He's not a doctor,

49:25.458 --> 49:28.333
but comes from
the land of the holistic approach.

49:28.458 --> 49:29.291
[Eileen gasps]

49:29.416 --> 49:31.750
I assure you,
this remedy will allay the pain.

49:32.458 --> 49:33.833
Knights have used it for centuries.

49:34.166 --> 49:36.250
Well, I suppose I could give that a try.

49:36.791 --> 49:38.000
Shouldn't hurt anything.

49:38.958 --> 49:41.875
-Well, it looks good on my side.
-Okay. Hold it there.

49:44.666 --> 49:45.750
All right.

49:47.541 --> 49:50.333
-I can take that for you, Brooke.
-Oh, thank you, David.

49:50.625 --> 49:53.625
You know, I'm so grateful
that you're here. I just--

49:53.875 --> 49:56.875
I think it's so amazing
you find the time to volunteer.

49:57.041 --> 49:58.666
I know you have your hands full.

49:59.250 --> 50:01.958
I want my kids to know
it's important to give back.

50:02.333 --> 50:03.750
You're a really good father.

50:07.708 --> 50:09.833
{\an8}His daughter is best friends with Claire.

50:10.125 --> 50:11.208
He's a good man.

50:20.000 --> 50:20.875
[door closes]

50:22.333 --> 50:26.708
Hey. I need to run to the market to grab
a few things for the Christmas Eve feast.

50:26.791 --> 50:28.625
-Care to join me?
-Indeed.

50:29.125 --> 50:29.958
Perfect.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.333
Oh, no sword.

50:34.666 --> 50:36.166
Just leave it.

50:41.083 --> 50:43.875
This is truly a bounty
unlike anything I've ever seen.

50:46.583 --> 50:49.750
Yeah. I suppose even I take for granted
how lucky we are.

50:52.125 --> 50:56.041
Where I come from, markets
consist of game, vegetables and bread.

51:04.625 --> 51:07.333
This must be that delicious mead
I've grown so fond of.

51:07.416 --> 51:08.708
Oh, yeah, that's the one.

51:09.583 --> 51:11.000
[Brooke chuckles]

51:11.166 --> 51:13.375
But, Cole, we only need one.

51:13.666 --> 51:15.375
I'm not hunkering down for the winter.

51:21.291 --> 51:24.250
What else? Where is bread?

51:24.333 --> 51:26.416
Oh... I--

51:29.458 --> 51:31.458
We're just--

51:34.125 --> 51:35.000
Well...

51:36.041 --> 51:38.083
You really love that hot chocolate.

51:38.166 --> 51:39.625
Here it is.

51:41.416 --> 51:44.375
Why don't you grab eight bags
of dinner rolls? Right there.

51:44.625 --> 51:45.708
You can never have too many.

51:46.875 --> 51:48.000
Miss Winters.

51:48.291 --> 51:49.458
Well, hello, Paige.

51:49.666 --> 51:51.750
Getting ready
for the Christmas feast, I see.

51:51.833 --> 51:52.750
I'm trying to.

51:54.083 --> 51:56.958
Are you feeling any better
since last time we talked?

51:57.166 --> 51:58.000
Much.

51:58.875 --> 52:01.041
I've been thinking a lot
about our conversation,

52:01.125 --> 52:03.833
and I'm really gonna try hard
to focus on my goals.

52:04.833 --> 52:07.541
And I was thinking maybe,

52:07.625 --> 52:11.583
you can give me an extra credit assignment
to help bring up my midterm.

52:12.041 --> 52:13.583
I'm sure we can figure out something.

52:14.250 --> 52:15.583
-Thank you.
-Of course.

52:20.333 --> 52:23.083
-Okay. Good luck with the feast.
-Thanks.

52:23.166 --> 52:24.416
-Bye.
-Bye.

52:25.291 --> 52:26.791
Cole? Cole,

52:27.333 --> 52:30.333
I said eight bags and nothing
about sampling them first.

52:32.875 --> 52:35.208
You can't serve that to your guests.
It tastes like cockhead.

52:35.625 --> 52:38.125
Okay. Well, then what do you suggest?

52:39.083 --> 52:43.375
Guide me down the path
containing flour, yeast and butter.

52:43.875 --> 52:45.708
You know, I'm really not the best cook,

52:45.791 --> 52:47.708
so why don't we just
stick to the next best thing?

52:48.541 --> 52:52.625
That would be me. I am a butcher,
baker, a candlestick maker.

52:53.750 --> 52:54.708
Of course you are.

52:58.541 --> 53:00.958
Mom, can Lily and I
go play outside in the snow?

53:01.041 --> 53:03.875
Oh, I don't know you guys.
It's snowing pretty hard.

53:04.333 --> 53:06.166
Please? Just for a while.

53:06.416 --> 53:09.208
Claire's gonna teach me
how to fight like a knight.

53:10.791 --> 53:12.083
Okay, fine.

53:12.166 --> 53:15.541
What's a little play date
without a little sword play, right?

53:16.166 --> 53:17.958
Hey. Hey, you, come back.

53:18.625 --> 53:20.083
Where are your red gloves?

53:20.166 --> 53:22.583
I gave them to Lily,
because she didn't have any.

53:23.208 --> 53:25.375
That was very sweet of you, Claire.

53:26.625 --> 53:29.500
{\an8}Any mismatches? Yes.

53:31.416 --> 53:32.250
Here you go.

53:35.041 --> 53:35.875
<i>Voilà. </i>

53:36.791 --> 53:37.666
Okay.

53:39.125 --> 53:41.125
-Bye.
-Stay close, please.

53:42.250 --> 53:43.083
[door closes]

53:43.416 --> 53:45.041
Where did you learn how to bake?

53:46.166 --> 53:48.708
As a squire,
I was assigned for a time to the kitchens.

53:49.666 --> 53:51.833
Griselda, the baker,
was a harsh taskmaster,

53:51.916 --> 53:53.541
but I learned much at her side.

53:53.666 --> 53:55.333
How long did you work in the kitchens?

53:56.125 --> 53:57.375
A couple of years.

53:58.541 --> 54:01.708
It was there I honed
my fencing and fighting skills,

54:02.250 --> 54:03.791
and learned to play the lute.

54:05.125 --> 54:07.541
You really are a Renaissance man,
aren't you?

54:08.333 --> 54:11.541
Jeez. It's turning out to be
a real blizzard out there.

54:12.791 --> 54:15.458
Now comes the magic ingredient.

54:16.166 --> 54:17.916
Can't have yuletide bean bread

54:18.875 --> 54:19.875
without the bean.

54:21.166 --> 54:22.500
But does it add flavor?

54:22.958 --> 54:23.958
Not at all.

54:24.666 --> 54:27.250
Legend has it the one who finds the bean

54:27.666 --> 54:30.416
is crowned king or queen of the feast
and gets to make a Christmas wish.

54:35.458 --> 54:36.875
But the dough will fail to rise

54:36.958 --> 54:39.375
if you continue to wrest it
like a dragon slayer.

54:47.125 --> 54:48.000
See?

54:50.166 --> 54:51.291
Not so difficult.

54:52.458 --> 54:55.458
No. Not so difficult at all.

54:55.875 --> 54:57.000
[phone ringing]

55:01.083 --> 55:02.458
Oh, it's my sister.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.083
Hey, Mads, what's up?

55:05.708 --> 55:06.583
Okay, calm down.

55:06.666 --> 55:08.333
-We'll be there in a minute.
-What's wrong?

55:08.916 --> 55:10.125
Claire is missing.

55:23.208 --> 55:25.541
David and Officer Stevens
are out looking for them,

55:25.625 --> 55:28.166
and they told me to stay close
in case they come back, but I...

55:28.250 --> 55:29.958
It's okay. They couldn't have gone far.

55:30.875 --> 55:31.833
It's okay.

55:36.416 --> 55:37.750
It appears they went this way.

55:38.375 --> 55:40.791
Don't worry, I pledge
to bring them back safe and sound.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Claire!

55:50.291 --> 55:52.458
-Lily!
-They went this way.

55:52.791 --> 55:53.791
Are you sure?

55:54.458 --> 55:56.916
I spent much of my life
riding and tracking through the woods.

55:57.458 --> 55:59.458
The signs are always there
if you look close enough.

56:00.833 --> 56:02.333
That's a fresh mark from a glove.

56:02.458 --> 56:03.416
Claire!

56:05.250 --> 56:07.708
Claire knows not to come
to Blue Limestone unsupervised.

56:08.333 --> 56:09.291
Claire!

56:09.375 --> 56:10.291
Lily!

56:12.583 --> 56:13.416
Oh, no.

56:13.875 --> 56:15.166
Not the lake.

56:20.500 --> 56:21.333
-There.
-Help!

56:21.625 --> 56:23.458
-Help!
-Lily, we're coming!

56:23.541 --> 56:24.458
Help!

56:28.666 --> 56:31.208
-There you go, lassie.
-Lily, what happened?

56:31.958 --> 56:33.250
Claire and I got lost,

56:33.333 --> 56:35.875
and Claire slipped on the ice,
and it cracked.

56:36.291 --> 56:37.125
Claire!

56:37.208 --> 56:38.166
I'm scared.

56:41.666 --> 56:42.500
[ice cracks]

56:44.750 --> 56:45.791
No.

56:46.333 --> 56:47.916
Listen to me very carefully.

56:48.125 --> 56:49.833
I need you to stay where you are.

56:50.125 --> 56:51.416
Cole, be careful.

56:51.708 --> 56:53.500
-Do not fear.
-The ice.

56:53.583 --> 56:55.833
Claire, have you ever seen a snail?

56:56.583 --> 56:57.416
Yes.

56:57.500 --> 57:00.166
Now, I need you
to pretend you're a snail right now

57:00.250 --> 57:02.500
and crawl slowly on your belly to me.

57:07.708 --> 57:09.083
Slower, little snail.

57:11.250 --> 57:14.666
I need you to be the slowest snail
that ever crawled the earth.

57:25.666 --> 57:26.500
That's it.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.583
That's it. Almost there.

57:33.375 --> 57:34.291
That's it.

57:35.541 --> 57:36.458
I've got you.

57:48.333 --> 57:49.458
Be careful now.

57:53.166 --> 57:54.375
[Brooke pants in relief]

57:55.000 --> 57:56.250
Claire, your mother is frantic.

57:56.333 --> 57:59.208
Aunt Brooke, I'm so sorry.
We got lost in the snow.

57:59.291 --> 58:00.750
It's okay. We found you.

58:03.541 --> 58:04.458
It's okay.

58:05.291 --> 58:06.583
Let's get the young'uns home.

58:09.125 --> 58:10.750
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

58:10.833 --> 58:12.708
I'd like to say this about you, Sir Cole.

58:13.708 --> 58:16.541
What you did today
was pretty valiant and heroic.

58:16.916 --> 58:20.333
So, now you see my duty is similar
to yours, as I now understand.

58:21.291 --> 58:22.250
To protect and serve.

58:23.416 --> 58:24.250
Right.

58:24.875 --> 58:25.750
Yes.

58:27.125 --> 58:29.875
Lily's dad wanted to thank you
for coming to our rescue.

58:30.500 --> 58:32.000
Oh, it would be my honor.

58:37.250 --> 58:41.041
{\an8}Well, it certainly looks like
his memory's not coming back.

58:41.541 --> 58:42.750
No, I guess not.

58:43.958 --> 58:47.291
But who are we to tell him
he's not who he says he is?

58:47.625 --> 58:48.458
Maybe.

58:48.791 --> 58:51.375
But do you really think going along
with this little delusion

58:51.458 --> 58:52.583
is helping the situation?

58:53.208 --> 58:54.708
It certainly did today.

58:56.375 --> 58:57.916
Congratulations.

58:58.750 --> 59:01.041
For finally fulfilling your quest.

59:01.375 --> 59:05.166
I guess now you can return home for
you brother's ceremony as a true knight.

59:07.208 --> 59:08.458
I think not.

59:09.458 --> 59:11.291
But if it wasn't for you, then...

59:11.500 --> 59:13.583
Today may have been a small act of valor,

59:13.708 --> 59:16.541
but I fear not enough to fulfill my quest.

59:16.958 --> 59:20.250
I don't get it. What is it going to take?

59:21.041 --> 59:22.416
The Crone spoke in riddles.

59:23.250 --> 59:24.875
It had something to do with my heart.

59:24.958 --> 59:27.208
Unless I can find
meaning in that, well, I...

59:28.291 --> 59:29.791
could be stuck here forever.

59:30.791 --> 59:32.375
Would that be so bad?

59:34.541 --> 59:37.000
Well, I might have thought so before...

59:42.916 --> 59:44.125
[door opens]

59:45.500 --> 59:46.541
Evan, you're home.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.166
Yes, we settled the case.

59:48.291 --> 59:51.458
and when I got off the plane,
I had dozens of voicemails from Madison.

59:51.583 --> 59:53.666
This is Cole, a new family friend.

59:54.666 --> 59:55.833
Nice to meet you, Cole.

59:56.458 --> 59:57.291
And you.

59:57.791 --> 59:59.000
We were just on our way out.

59:59.083 --> 01:00:00.708
Madison's upstairs
putting Claire to sleep.

01:00:01.166 --> 01:00:02.291
She'll fill you in.

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:06.083
Perfect. Any chance
that you can hide these at your house?

01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:07.708
Oh, yeah. Of course.

01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:08.666
[Brooke chuckles]

01:00:08.791 --> 01:00:11.625
-Claire's a snoop, huh?
-No, your sister is.

01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:14.666
Can you believe it?
Christmas Eve is tomorrow.

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.375
[Evan laughs]

01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:23.500
I don't understand. Why are we here?

01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:26.250
I've been here twice already
and both times come up empty.

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:28.875
Maybe you just need a fresh set of eyes.

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.166
Look, the Crone
sent you here for a reason,

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.583
so there must be
something quest worthy.

01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:37.750
I don't understand.
Then how is a prospective suitor

01:00:38.083 --> 01:00:40.083
supposed to prove
his worthiness to a lady?

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:42.250
I don't know.

01:00:43.166 --> 01:00:45.833
But I will let you know
the minute I find out.

01:00:46.916 --> 01:00:47.833
I'll say this.

01:00:48.458 --> 01:00:51.958
Romance in the future
is much more complex than days of yore.

01:00:52.958 --> 01:00:56.750
Well, if it means anything,
I prefer yore over mine.

01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:02.500
Two hours, two hot cocoas,
and yet nary a quest in sight.

01:01:02.583 --> 01:01:05.208
My bad. I figured it was worth a shot.

01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:07.916
Hello. I was just on my way
to get one of those.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.750
Oh, you should. They're delicious.

01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:11.500
He loves them.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.041
Pickpocket!

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.833
Stop, thief! Quick! Lend me your sword.

01:01:16.208 --> 01:01:17.416
It's only rubber!

01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:26.958
Return the lady's purse
or suffer the consequences.

01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:28.125
Take it.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.458
Where I come from, thieves
are strung up by their thumbs and hung,

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:32.958
or we save the hangman the rope

01:01:33.041 --> 01:01:35.000
and cut off his hands
so he can never steal again.

01:01:36.666 --> 01:01:37.708
I believe this is for you.

01:01:37.791 --> 01:01:39.125
Oh, thank you.

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:40.791
{\an8}Wait, Bruce Douglas?

01:01:40.875 --> 01:01:42.083
{\an8}Well, what do you think?

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:44.750
-Should we let him keep his hands?
-Yeah.

01:01:44.833 --> 01:01:46.791
-Yes.
-Yeah.

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:51.750
Do you understand your rights
as they've been read to you?

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:54.791
Yeah, just keep
that crazy sword guy away from me.

01:01:56.583 --> 01:02:00.541
Well, you're turning into quite
the natural at this game, Cole.

01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:05.250
[Officer laughs]

01:02:05.916 --> 01:02:08.541
You know, you should
consider joining the force.

01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:12.375
It would be an honor
to ride and serve alongside you.

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.375
Of course you'd have to pass
the psych exam first.

01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:19.875
Well, I shall study for it night and day
until I'm well prepared.

01:02:23.208 --> 01:02:24.041
Right.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:31.083
Right.

01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:32.916
Good job.

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.250
Thank you, Brooke.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.916
I don't know. I'm just
beginning to wonder what I'm doing here.

01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:44.208
I just-- I don't get it, Cole.

01:02:44.541 --> 01:02:47.791
You mean to tell me
that single-handedly capturing a thief

01:02:47.875 --> 01:02:49.166
still isn't quest worthy?

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:52.791
I'm beginning to wonder whether being
a true knight is my destiny after all.

01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:53.708
Wow!

01:02:53.833 --> 01:02:57.875
Okay, hold on. I'm calling
a big timeout on that negativity.

01:02:58.416 --> 01:02:59.250
Look.

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:03.416
You promised me
you wouldn't give up faith.

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:06.625
And it ain't over
until the Old Crone sings.

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:11.958
I believe in you, Cole.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.208
Never were there
four little words that managed

01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:19.833
to wrap my weary heart
into a warm blanket.

01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:28.083
Thank you, Brooke.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.833
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:03:38.875 --> 01:03:39.833
[Brooke exhales]

01:03:49.416 --> 01:03:52.458
Lady Alexa Play, play "Deck the Halls".

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:53.958
<i>[Alexa] Here's "Deck the Halls".</i>

01:03:54.166 --> 01:03:56.291
["Deck the Halls" by Nat King Cole
playing]

01:03:56.375 --> 01:03:58.375
[Cole vocalizes together]

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.833
You know, this place is lucky
to see me microwave ramen.

01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:09.291
Thank you.

01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:12.791
I can't remember
the last time it smelt so homey.

01:04:13.541 --> 01:04:15.458
This all brings me right back to my youth.

01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:16.458
Really?

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:18.333
That's an amazing youth.

01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:21.083
Oh, wow. Look at you two.

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:23.583
Well, I don't want to interrupt.

01:04:23.708 --> 01:04:27.291
I just wanted to bring you this
to show our appreciation.

01:04:27.958 --> 01:04:30.708
And here is your suit for tonight.

01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:32.875
It's mead.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:36.500
-Madison, that's so thoughtful.
-Thank you.

01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:38.125
I'm learning from my little one.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:41.291
Hey, do you know that the other day
she gave her mittens to David's daughter

01:04:41.375 --> 01:04:43.625
-'cause the poor thing didn't have any?
-What?

01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:45.416
Claire has a kind heart.

01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:47.750
Like her aunt, like her mother.

01:04:48.958 --> 01:04:52.333
You know, David's wife passed away
last year after a long illness.

01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:55.375
He has four young kids
and holds down two jobs

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:57.208
just to keep a roof over their heads.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.916
That's truly a tale of woe.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.541
Yeah, and still after all that
he makes time to volunteer

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:04.958
because he wants his kids to know
how important it is to give back.

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:07.625
He sounds like a man of pure heart.

01:05:09.666 --> 01:05:12.625
Perhaps that's what the Old Crone
meant by her riddle.

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:13.916
What?

01:05:16.208 --> 01:05:18.333
Maybe I found my quest after all.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:31.041
This fancy neck ribbon
seems more like a torture device.

01:05:34.708 --> 01:05:35.833
[Brooke chuckles]

01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:37.291
Perhaps I can help.

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:39.500
What's wrong?

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.291
Nothing. Nothing at all.

01:05:46.625 --> 01:05:48.500
It's just you look...

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:51.083
positively radiant.

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:53.625
Why, thank you.

01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:58.291
And you, my knight
in shining cashmere wool blend...

01:05:59.416 --> 01:06:01.333
Well, the costume fits okay.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.250
I'm having a little trouble
with the neck ribbon.

01:06:04.708 --> 01:06:05.875
[Brooke giggles]

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.791
It's called a tie. Here.

01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:22.916
I actually have no idea what I'm doing.

01:06:23.708 --> 01:06:24.791
[Both chuckle]

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:27.708
I have something for you. Stay here.

01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:34.541
Okay. Close your eyes
and hold out your hand.

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:38.208
I've played this game once with my brother
and I got slimed by a toad.

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:41.916
It's not a toad. I promise.
Just-- Come on.

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:45.458
Okay. Open them.

01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:49.250
[Cole chuckles softly]

01:06:51.125 --> 01:06:52.208
It's an orange.

01:06:54.958 --> 01:06:55.958
You remembered.

01:06:56.916 --> 01:07:01.708
And we don't use halfpennies anymore,
but that's an American half dollar.

01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:11.333
This means more to me
than words can express.

01:07:15.208 --> 01:07:16.250
Thank you, Brooke.

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:22.583
[phone chimes]

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.875
Wow. A text in all caps!

01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:30.500
-We should go.
-Okay.

01:07:31.666 --> 01:07:33.666
["Jingle Bells" by The Miracles playing]

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.541
-Well, Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas to you.

01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:45.666
And I just wanted to tell you

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.333
that your yuletide bread
is the hit of the feast.

01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:51.125
Well, thank you.
It's an old family recipe.

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:54.791
Legend has it, the one
who finds the bean gets to make a wish.

01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:57.041
Oh. Well, I'll be on the lookout.

01:07:57.333 --> 01:08:00.958
And how is your husband's aching back?
I trust my ointment did the trick.

01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:04.291
I'll say. Yeah... Here he comes.  Just--

01:08:05.375 --> 01:08:07.458
Just tell me how to hit the off button.

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:09.833
Okay, Fred. All right.

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:15.916
-Merry Christmas Eve.
-Merry Christmas Eve.

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:17.291
You look beautiful.

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:19.541
-Oh, thank you. So do you.
-Come here, you son of a gun.

01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:20.582
[Cole grunts]

01:08:21.332 --> 01:08:24.332
Is this some kind of
Christmas wrestling tradition?

01:08:24.416 --> 01:08:27.125
I'm guessing Evan found out
how you saved his daughter yesterday

01:08:27.207 --> 01:08:29.082
and just wants to thank you.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:31.500
You're very welcome, sir.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.332
-I think we should get things started.
-Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:08:38.957 --> 01:08:42.707
Welcome everyone
to this year's Christmas Eve feast.

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:45.457
My mom and dad used to say that

01:08:45.541 --> 01:08:49.625
Christmas spirit is about
kindness and compassion towards others.

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.791
And never has that sentiment

01:08:51.875 --> 01:08:55.707
been more true than
at this year's Christmas Eve feast.

01:08:55.916 --> 01:08:56.875
Enjoy, everyone!

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
[people clapping]

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:07.457
I wish we had a Christmas tree like this.

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:11.166
Yeah, but what's the best thing
under any Christmas tree?

01:09:11.332 --> 01:09:13.291
-Love.
-That's right.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.207
David, if you'd all come with me.

01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:17.625
Come on, guys. Come on.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.250
What's going on?

01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:29.957
Will, Lily, Taylor, Reed,

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.291
I understand you've
all been quite good this year.

01:09:33.416 --> 01:09:36.541
Yes, it appears this year
Father Christmas,

01:09:37.082 --> 01:09:38.875
Santa made a slight miscalculation.

01:09:40.291 --> 01:09:43.832
Well, he accidentally
brought all of your presents here

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:45.291
rather than your home.

01:09:46.375 --> 01:09:48.707
That's-- That's for us?

01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:50.750
Yes, they are.
Get in there. Open them up.

01:09:53.582 --> 01:09:54.458
Cool.

01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:57.416
Dad. Santa brought me a new bike.

01:09:57.875 --> 01:10:00.125
Daddy, look, a new coat and new boots.

01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:04.166
And... this is for you.

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:10.083
Oh, no. I can't accept. This is too much.

01:10:10.166 --> 01:10:12.291
No, this is what the feast is all about.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:16.041
That's why the whole town pitched in
with presents, so that your kids and you

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:18.291
can have an extra
special Christmas this year.

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:21.041
I don't know what to say.

01:10:21.666 --> 01:10:24.458
I know times are hard right now.
And we're here for you.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.416
Thank you.

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:29.958
I promise to pay it forward when I can.

01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:31.958
Well, from my eyes,

01:10:33.541 --> 01:10:34.666
you already have.

01:10:41.833 --> 01:10:43.250
We did good, Cole.

01:10:43.416 --> 01:10:45.791
{\an8}Surely your quest is completed now.

01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:48.333
Well, I have one more promise to keep.

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:51.000
It appears we have
a nonbeliever in our midst.

01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:54.333
A problem I plan on remedying posthaste.

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:56.500
Well, alrighty then.

01:10:58.583 --> 01:11:00.583
[kids laughing]

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:06.833
See? I told you he was a real knight.

01:11:07.083 --> 01:11:08.166
Wow!

01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:10.333
Look over here, kids.

01:11:15.291 --> 01:11:16.541
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:20.375
Okay. Boys, come on.
Let's give somebody else a turn.

01:11:20.458 --> 01:11:21.291
Come on.

01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:22.791
Come on.

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:26.250
Face that way.

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:30.000
-Okay, squeeze in.
-Crowd in.

01:11:30.416 --> 01:11:31.791
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

01:11:32.833 --> 01:11:34.333
There we are.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.708
Perhaps someone else
should care for a selfie?

01:11:37.791 --> 01:11:40.000
I certainly wouldn't
turn down an invitation.

01:11:41.208 --> 01:11:43.083
Look, Cole, mistletoe.

01:11:43.416 --> 01:11:44.666
You know what that means?

01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:47.458
The dung plant
that wards off evil spirits?

01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:51.458
No, silly. It's tradition to kiss
if you're caught under the mistletoe.

01:11:51.958 --> 01:11:53.250
Bad luck if you don't.

01:12:02.083 --> 01:12:05.291
Something tells me you should save this
for someone you really care about.

01:12:07.916 --> 01:12:09.041
Merry Christmas.

01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:11.250
And to you.

01:12:37.916 --> 01:12:42.333
Hey. Hon, we'd love to help you clean up,
but we got to get this little one to bed.

01:12:42.416 --> 01:12:43.500
-Of course.
-Yes.

01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:45.333
And I've gotta practice my surprise face

01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:48.333
when I open up the box of slippers
Madison got me for Christmas.

01:12:48.416 --> 01:12:50.250
-They're not slippers.
-Yeah, I figured.

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:51.333
[both laugh]

01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:52.625
Sleep tight, kiddo.

01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:58.916
Oh, Brooke, we've got this handled.
You enjoy the rest of your evening.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.416
Oh, Eileen, you're the best.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.208
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, sweetie.

01:13:03.625 --> 01:13:05.291
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

01:13:07.041 --> 01:13:07.958
I'll see you guys.

01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:08.958
I'll see you guys.

01:13:09.291 --> 01:13:10.375
[Brooke laughs]

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.291
You summoned me, sire?

01:13:18.083 --> 01:13:20.708
Indeed. I was hoping
you might enlighten me

01:13:20.791 --> 01:13:22.791
on the fact of a certain
Christmas tradition.

01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:24.250
Oh. Okay.

01:13:26.958 --> 01:13:30.458
From what I gather,
it's bad luck if a couple don't kiss

01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:32.291
whence they find themselves underneath it.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.333
Oh, well, it's probably
just some silly old wives' tale.

01:13:41.291 --> 01:13:42.583
But why risk it?

01:13:58.583 --> 01:13:59.666
Cole, your medallion.

01:14:00.791 --> 01:14:01.875
The Old Crone.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.458
Well, what does it mean?

01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:07.041
Well, it means we must go.
Come. Quick. Take me to your trusty steed.

01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:13.125
This is where I arrived,
so it must be my way back.

01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:14.250
Back where?

01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:19.708
Well, back to my home.

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:23.333
Oh, well,
then you've fulfilled your quest.

01:14:24.208 --> 01:14:25.583
You're a true knight?

01:14:28.208 --> 01:14:30.000
Well, I should be forever grateful to you.

01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:34.291
While my heart
is heavy saying goodbye, I--

01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:38.416
I have no choice.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.625
I must return home for my brother's
knighting ceremony. It's...

01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:43.791
It's my duty.

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:47.791
No, I understand.
It's the knight's code. You have to go.

01:14:50.541 --> 01:14:51.541
No matter what...

01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:54.541
no matter where I am...

01:14:56.333 --> 01:14:58.166
I hereby pledge my service to thee.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:02.458
You're not making this easy, Cole.

01:15:06.333 --> 01:15:07.958
You helped me believe in myself.

01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:11.166
For that,

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:13.833
you'll forever be in my heart.

01:15:22.291 --> 01:15:25.291
Fare thee well, my Lady Brooke.

01:15:26.416 --> 01:15:27.833
Goodbye, Sir Cole.

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:49.041
Cole?

01:15:50.041 --> 01:15:52.333
What? Cole?

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:15.000
Miss Winters.

01:16:16.416 --> 01:16:19.000
You will never believe what happened.

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:21.958
Grayson is begging me to take him back.

01:16:22.041 --> 01:16:23.458
-Oh?
-Right?

01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:25.291
I told him to forget it,

01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:28.541
because true love
only exists in fairy tales.

01:16:29.666 --> 01:16:33.083
And from now on,
I'm only focusing on my goals.

01:16:34.916 --> 01:16:36.166
Paige, I was wrong.

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:39.166
But you said--

01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:41.208
No, not about your goals. That's good.

01:16:41.666 --> 01:16:43.916
But about true love.

01:16:44.958 --> 01:16:46.125
It does exist.

01:16:47.666 --> 01:16:48.583
Really?

01:16:49.291 --> 01:16:52.000
You know, it may not
come around that often, but...

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:55.750
when it does, you'll recognize it.

01:16:57.125 --> 01:17:00.708
When someone loves you
completely for who you are,

01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:03.791
and you want what's best
for them, too, even--

01:17:06.208 --> 01:17:07.958
Even if it means it's not with you.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.083
Oh, sorry.

01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:12.291
That's okay.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.583
Okay.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:20.750
-Merry Christmas, Miss Winters.
-Merry Christmas to you, too, Paige.

01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:22.583
Bye.

01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:30.875
[song playing]

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:08.208
[Brooke sighs and gasps]

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:10.875
The magic bean.

01:18:15.333 --> 01:18:17.166
I wish Cole was still here.

01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:44.208
[sobs]

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:57.750
-My lord.
-Yes?

01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:02.708
Sherwyn!

01:19:09.458 --> 01:19:11.458
[horse galloping]

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:17.458
Sherwyn!

01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:20.125
[horse neighing]

01:19:23.875 --> 01:19:25.125
[horse neighs]

01:19:26.708 --> 01:19:27.666
Brother?

01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:29.625
Geoffrey.

01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:35.916
Your horse returned without you days ago.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.500
We searched and searched
but feared you were lost in the storm.

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:39.916
I was, yes.

01:19:40.916 --> 01:19:41.750
Lost.

01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:44.250
The ceremony should begin soon,
then I shall seek my quest.

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:46.125
I made it back in time.

01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:50.041
If I may offer you some advice.

01:19:50.125 --> 01:19:51.125
By all means.

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:52.708
Be kind to all you meet.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.625
It was a crone who urged me

01:19:54.708 --> 01:19:58.666
to seek my quest with my heart,
that a true knight could emerge.

01:19:59.125 --> 01:20:00.458
And are you a true knight?

01:20:01.583 --> 01:20:02.416
I am.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.583
Huzzah! Then let us celebrate
over a tankard of ale.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:06.875
Alas...

01:20:08.166 --> 01:20:11.333
my heart also led me to my lady Brooke.

01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:15.125
You're in love.

01:20:15.958 --> 01:20:17.166
I can see it on your face.

01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:19.958
I believe so, yes.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.375
I was a fool to have left her.

01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:26.666
What is this?

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.375
My weakness was not realizing sooner.

01:20:32.083 --> 01:20:33.291
You must go to her.

01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:34.958
But your knighting ceremony.

01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:38.666
Is of no importance
in comparison to matters of the heart.

01:20:40.583 --> 01:20:42.750
I wish you well, always.

01:20:42.833 --> 01:20:43.875
I carry you with me.

01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:46.291
I carry you with me.

01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:55.791
Away with you.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.750
Go, find your fair lady Brooke.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:02.791
If you're sure.

01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:04.708
I am.

01:21:06.375 --> 01:21:07.541
Good luck with the ceremony.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:21.208
It's Christmas! Santa came.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.041
[Mads chuckles]

01:21:24.916 --> 01:21:26.083
Where's my stocking?

01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:29.916
-It was there last night.
-Yeah, that's strange.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:30.833
Where is it?

01:21:32.041 --> 01:21:33.375
It's a puppy!

01:21:35.333 --> 01:21:36.291
[dog cries]

01:21:36.375 --> 01:21:38.041
What-- Did you--

01:21:38.125 --> 01:21:39.958
No. Did you?

01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:42.666
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

01:21:46.208 --> 01:21:47.458
Merry Christmas!

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:50.250
Aunt Brooke, you'll never believe
what Santa brought me.

01:21:51.375 --> 01:21:52.500
A puppy.

01:21:53.291 --> 01:21:54.250
Wow. Really?

01:21:55.208 --> 01:21:58.333
Yeah, you don't happen to know
anything about this, do you?

01:21:58.416 --> 01:21:59.583
No, why?

01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:02.541
Because neither do we.
Which means there's no explanation.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Yes, there is.

01:22:04.583 --> 01:22:05.791
Christmas magic.

01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:08.875
You swear you had nothing to do

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:09.916
-with this puppy?
-No.

01:22:10.166 --> 01:22:13.125
So, Claire is right
and it's Christmas magic?

01:22:14.416 --> 01:22:17.291
Well, just because you can't
explain something logically,

01:22:17.375 --> 01:22:18.583
doesn't mean it can't happen.

01:22:20.458 --> 01:22:23.583
Like your time-traveling knight.
Where is he, by the way?

01:22:23.666 --> 01:22:25.708
He's... gone home.

01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:30.291
I... I don't think
I'll ever see him again.

01:22:31.208 --> 01:22:32.583
Oh, honey,

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:35.000
I'm so sorry.

01:22:35.458 --> 01:22:37.875
I thought you two
had something really special.

01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:40.000
Yeah, so did I.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.750
Brooke, merry Christmas.

01:22:45.833 --> 01:22:47.041
Merry Christmas.

01:22:47.625 --> 01:22:48.833
-All right.
-Thanks.

01:22:48.958 --> 01:22:50.166
-All right.
-Thanks.

01:22:51.041 --> 01:22:53.541
-You ready to open up some presents?
-And later,

01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:56.875
Daddy's going to take us back
to the Christmas Castle. Wanna come?

01:22:56.958 --> 01:22:58.750
-I...
-I know you're not feeling it,

01:22:58.833 --> 01:23:02.541
but it's Christmas.

01:23:02.625 --> 01:23:04.625
[both laughing]

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:09.416
[Cole] Crone!

01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:18.625
Crone!

01:23:20.875 --> 01:23:21.708
Crone!

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:25.250
Crone! Old Crone!

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.750
I have need of you.

01:23:29.875 --> 01:23:32.875
Love is the first and foremost
of all knightly virtues.

01:23:33.458 --> 01:23:34.875
I understand that now.

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:41.333
It's love.

01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:43.708
I beg thee, Crone.

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:46.250
Whatever it is that you desire,

01:23:46.875 --> 01:23:47.708
I will do...

01:23:48.916 --> 01:23:50.708
if you help me return to my truest love.

01:23:55.125 --> 01:23:55.958
Please.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:58.750
Very well.

01:23:59.375 --> 01:24:01.458
You have proven yourself worthy.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:08.583
[people chattering]

01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:15.791
While I may never understand
our Christmas miracle pup,

01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:18.958
I have to admit, he's growing on me.

01:24:19.791 --> 01:24:21.833
Hey, that's not a half bad name for him.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.125
Miracle. What do you think
about that, Claire?

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:27.291
I already named him. Knight.

01:24:27.791 --> 01:24:30.458
-What do you think, Aunt Brooke?
-It's perfect.

01:24:31.583 --> 01:24:34.041
Where's Cole?
I thought he was going to join us.

01:24:34.416 --> 01:24:36.916
Oh, yeah, sweetie.
He had to leave last night.

01:24:37.416 --> 01:24:39.500
Why? I thought he liked it here.

01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:40.541
Oh, he did.

01:24:41.125 --> 01:24:42.666
He really did, but...

01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:45.416
his calling was far, far away.

01:24:46.125 --> 01:24:47.166
What's a calling?

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:50.458
It's a job. Like the business trip
Daddy just went on.

01:24:50.791 --> 01:24:53.333
Oh. Then he's coming back then. Right?

01:24:56.083 --> 01:24:57.333
I don't know, Claire Bear.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.708
Hey, but I do know
we sure had fun while he was here.

01:25:02.791 --> 01:25:03.625
Right?

01:25:07.708 --> 01:25:08.583
It's Cole!

01:25:08.916 --> 01:25:10.916
And he brought his horse.

01:25:11.458 --> 01:25:14.000
-Delighting in your company.
-Cole, I thought you were gone,

01:25:14.208 --> 01:25:15.708
like, for good.

01:25:16.416 --> 01:25:18.500
Brooke, I should have realized it sooner,

01:25:19.625 --> 01:25:20.708
you are my quest.

01:25:21.875 --> 01:25:24.250
-I'm your quest?
-Yes.

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:26.083
And my heart is

01:25:26.958 --> 01:25:28.666
eternally and devotedly yours.

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:31.541
If you will have me.

01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:35.041
Nothing would make me happier,

01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:37.333
my handsome knight.

01:25:38.625 --> 01:25:39.583
My fair maiden.

01:25:52.583 --> 01:25:54.750
You are going to miss being a knight.

01:25:55.458 --> 01:25:56.750
What will you do here?

01:25:57.291 --> 01:26:00.166
Perhaps I'll join Officer Stevens
and his order of present-day knights.

01:26:00.833 --> 01:26:02.083
Or open my own bakery.

01:26:04.083 --> 01:26:06.125
I can't believe you came back for me.

01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:08.250
Wherever you are,

01:26:09.416 --> 01:26:10.916
it's the only place I want to be.

01:26:23.875 --> 01:26:25.333
[horse neighs]

01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:28.416
I found Sherwyn.

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:29.708
Hi, Sherwyn.

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.750
-Wanna come for a ride?
-Sure.

01:27:34.083 --> 01:27:35.416
Huzzah! To the quest!

01:27:36.791 --> 01:27:37.625
Come.

01:27:40.083 --> 01:27:42.083
Lord Seamus will get the door.

01:27:48.791 --> 01:27:51.166
You truly are a handsome young knight.

01:27:51.916 --> 01:27:54.541
Pray you help one as beauteous as myself?

01:27:56.375 --> 01:27:57.333
One moment.

01:28:00.125 --> 01:28:03.791
Sir Geoffrey Alexander Edward Lyons
at your service.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
