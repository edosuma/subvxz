WEBVTT

00:44.250 --> 00:45.582
Oh! Brian!

00:45.582 --> 00:49.290
You'd better have skills in that box if you're gonna score with Jenny Matrix!

00:49.290 --> 00:52.125
No, Ted this is just a little professional party present

00:52.125 --> 00:54.250
for the JV captain.

00:56.290 --> 01:00.457
"Happy party, Jenny. Let's go Coco-nuts..."

01:00.457 --> 01:03.625
Wait you're gonna bribe your way into JV with a cake?

01:03.625 --> 01:05.540
Coconut cake.

01:05.540 --> 01:07.915
Let's just say I'm a 12th level pastrymancer

01:07.915 --> 01:11.165
and once she tastes this bad boy, I'm in.

01:11.165 --> 01:13.415
Maybe this date will become a double date!

01:13.415 --> 01:14.375
Oh! Brian!

01:14.375 --> 01:16.000
I was meaning to tell you something...

01:16.000 --> 01:17.957
What was it, what was it, what was it...

01:17.957 --> 01:20.375
Brian D! You made it!

01:37.207 --> 01:39.332
Hey, Jenny... um...

01:40.290 --> 01:42.750
Oh! My gosh! I totally nailed it I have to show you!

01:42.750 --> 01:45.207
Come to my room!

01:46.707 --> 01:49.540
Well... what should I do with this bad boy?

01:49.540 --> 01:51.790
I dunno. Give it to the party.

01:51.790 --> 01:54.082
Let them eat cake!

01:56.665 --> 01:58.957
Come on - hurry!

02:01.790 --> 02:03.957
So... there are a lot of people here...

02:03.957 --> 02:06.000
First date, huh?

02:06.832 --> 02:09.582
Wanna... watch me play video games?

02:09.582 --> 02:12.000
Oh... I thought people did romantic things on first dates.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.582
Exactamundo.

02:15.957 --> 02:17.375
Whoa.

02:19.165 --> 02:20.457
So, uh...

02:20.457 --> 02:22.375
Lotta cool stuff in this room.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.290
Huh? Yeah, sorry it's a mess.

02:24.290 --> 02:26.207
You can just sit wherever.

02:26.790 --> 02:28.125
Okay...

02:29.582 --> 02:31.500
This is gonna blow your mind...

02:32.500 --> 02:33.332
Bam!

02:33.332 --> 02:35.250
I totally beat your time!

02:35.582 --> 02:36.957
Suck it!

02:36.957 --> 02:38.875
Wow. Great job - that's like the...

02:38.875 --> 02:41.332
Only high score I've ever held in anything.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.957
Well, that and Dance Ex Machina...

02:43.957 --> 02:46.040
Wait wait wait...

02:46.040 --> 02:48.040
You play DXM?

02:48.500 --> 02:50.625
Which I don't play anymore because that's a

02:50.625 --> 02:53.082
Lame baby game for babies.

02:53.250 --> 02:57.125
I play manly games now like, uh, War and...

02:58.540 --> 03:02.415
Oh my God you're a 12th level dancemancer?

03:04.040 --> 03:06.540
Did I say "baby game" because I meant, uh...

03:06.540 --> 03:10.165
"babe game" for, uh, people.

03:10.165 --> 03:12.332
No it is a baby game.

03:12.332 --> 03:17.040
Which is why if you tell anyone there's a DXM machine collecting dust in my garage...

03:17.040 --> 03:19.832
I will literally murder you.

03:22.957 --> 03:25.290
Wait, you mean you don't play anymore?

03:25.290 --> 03:27.125
But you were clearly the shiz!

03:27.125 --> 03:29.915
Yeah... not according to my mom.

03:30.165 --> 03:32.750
She kinda coaches the Denver Commandos.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.165
Full disclosure - I totally knew that.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.832
Let's just say this is an FPS family

03:39.832 --> 03:42.415
and she expects me to make the pros.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.290
You're totally gonna! I mean...

03:44.290 --> 03:46.875
When I saw you at the Invitationals last year

03:46.875 --> 03:49.457
You made JV captain

03:50.000 --> 03:52.290
You're amazing, Jenny.

03:53.750 --> 03:56.040
But that's no excuse not to get your dance on!

03:56.540 --> 03:57.750
This is a party, you know?

03:57.750 --> 03:59.290
Let's go fire that baby up!

03:59.290 --> 04:01.040
Party! Right!

04:01.040 --> 04:03.165
Speaking of which, we should get back!

04:03.165 --> 04:05.332
I could totally slam another drink right now!

04:05.332 --> 04:06.375
Let's go!

04:07.125 --> 04:08.125
Let's go!

04:10.707 --> 04:12.875
I've got rock star in my blood, Ki.

04:13.582 --> 04:15.665
I don't know if you know this but...

04:15.665 --> 04:19.332
My father is three-time Guitar Hero world champion...

04:20.083 --> 04:22.083
Freddie Wong.

04:23.708 --> 04:27.500
I'm assuming you're very good since you've chosen the hardest difficulty level.

04:28.458 --> 04:31.375
Gotta play hard to rock hard Ki.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.583
Here we go!

04:38.540 --> 04:42.082
Jeez! Who calibrated this thing?

04:44.125 --> 04:47.290
Whoa! New section! Let's see if I can handle this...

04:47.290 --> 04:50.832
Haven't had to improv in a while...

04:52.333 --> 04:55.500
Sorry about that! Lousy guitar!

04:59.625 --> 05:01.125
Let's play my game!

05:01.125 --> 05:02.665
Whoa - you make games?

05:02.665 --> 05:04.250
Yeah! That's right! Well...

05:04.625 --> 05:06.625
Actually the one I'm working on is for children...

05:06.625 --> 05:08.750
But on the plus side there's no way to lose!

05:10.333 --> 05:12.208
I'm in!

05:14.290 --> 05:17.207
What up dudes! Now this is where the real party is going down.

05:17.458 --> 05:20.375
That cool freshman over there is Games Dean

05:20.625 --> 05:22.458
And this is the FPS team -

05:22.458 --> 05:25.916
We have: Cold Turkey, Piepuppy, Alliterator...

05:25.915 --> 05:29.375
And I'm sure you already know - The Law.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.666
Hey Brian!

05:31.665 --> 05:33.875
Great to finally meet you!

05:35.915 --> 05:37.707
He ain't much of a talker, is he?

05:37.708 --> 05:40.333
Relax dude! I should be nervous to meet you!

05:40.458 --> 05:42.458
I mean, I'm not, of course.

05:42.458 --> 05:45.083
Law, seriously - stop screwing with the freshman.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.833
Okay JV captain buzzkill!

05:48.083 --> 05:50.541
Hey Bri-guy - you wanna tuck into some cake?

05:50.540 --> 05:52.707
Wait, wait. There's... cake?

05:52.708 --> 05:55.458
Over here, Jenny.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.583
Whoa, Games Dean brought us a kickin' coconut cake!

05:58.583 --> 06:01.041
Check it - I baked it for you.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.625
Dude are you kidding me?

06:02.625 --> 06:06.415
Are you coco-kidding me I am coocoo for coconut cake!

06:06.790 --> 06:10.582
Oh man! - Oh man is this guy on the scrimmage tomorrow or what?

06:11.083 --> 06:13.708
Dig in, everybody! - It's so good!

06:13.708 --> 06:15.625
This is... so good.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.625
You're the coolest!

06:22.665 --> 06:24.082
My cake...

06:24.083 --> 06:26.833
Don't waste it now. - It's so good though!

06:29.415 --> 06:33.207
Whoa! I'm sorry about that! Oh my God!

06:33.208 --> 06:35.958
Here... let me dab that off for you.

06:35.958 --> 06:37.375
Seriously?

06:37.375 --> 06:40.083
Hey, man, speaking of apologies...

06:40.083 --> 06:42.458
About your keyboard the other day...

06:42.458 --> 06:45.666
I'm super-dee-duper broken up about it.

06:45.665 --> 06:49.832
Whaddya say we bury that little hatchet VGHS style

06:49.833 --> 06:51.958
with a little friendly competish?

06:51.958 --> 06:54.708
Go ahead! Pick any game in the house - you and me!

06:55.040 --> 06:57.790
You know what Law, I'm just here to party.

06:57.790 --> 07:00.000
So I'm not going to fall for one of your stupid little ploys.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.708
Sorry, yeah it is a party. How rude of me.

07:03.708 --> 07:06.458
Maybe you'd like a little party trick then!?

07:06.458 --> 07:08.416
A dash of magic!?

07:10.250 --> 07:13.040
A little splash of razzmatazz?

07:13.040 --> 07:16.040
Was that the whole trick? Because you just... - Whoa!

07:16.040 --> 07:19.832
Everybody! Check out the size of this kid's pokéballs!

07:19.833 --> 07:24.041
Brian D just challenged me to a match!

07:24.040 --> 07:26.332
Seriously, Brian?

07:26.333 --> 07:27.583
Actually, Law...

07:27.583 --> 07:30.375
Because that is how I like to party!

07:30.375 --> 07:33.833
You guys! Check it out! Brian D is gonna fight The Law!

07:38.415 --> 07:40.125
Abracadabra.

07:41.208 --> 07:42.750
Whoa!

07:42.750 --> 07:45.958
And since mathematically it's the only shape to always correct itself...

07:45.958 --> 07:49.708
I, um, thought the gömböc would make a nice miniboss!

07:49.708 --> 07:52.291
I don't know though. Maybe it's stupid.

07:52.290 --> 07:56.790
What? No! It's awesome!

07:56.790 --> 08:01.290
You could call it the, uh... göm-boss!

08:04.708 --> 08:09.208
You call that a game? More like a lame!

08:09.208 --> 08:10.708
Drifters!

08:11.500 --> 08:12.625
Drift!

08:12.625 --> 08:14.540
Hey! Leave her alone!

08:14.540 --> 08:18.165
Ki's weird math game is way cooler than drift racing!

08:18.165 --> 08:21.540
Cooler than Overdrift? Maybe in Lameland!

08:21.540 --> 08:23.125
Cool callback, bro!

08:23.125 --> 08:24.165
Give me that!

08:24.458 --> 08:26.708
Hey give that back or else!

08:26.708 --> 08:29.916
Is that a challenge, Theodore?

08:29.915 --> 08:32.832
Drift King. What do you want?

08:32.832 --> 08:34.414
One race, Ted! One race and the lady's weird math game is yours!

08:34.416 --> 08:39.416
One race, Ted! One race and the lady's weird

08:39.416 --> 08:42.166
So you're extorting people now?

08:42.166 --> 08:45.166
Not very chivalrous, my liege!

08:45.166 --> 08:47.250
Desperate times, Ted.

08:47.250 --> 08:50.750
I haven't felt true competition since last we dueled!

08:51.416 --> 08:54.541
Have ye not the need for speed?

08:54.541 --> 08:57.958
Um, Ted - I forgot to hit save on the game folder so if that tablet shuts off...

08:57.957 --> 08:59.957
I won't let that happen!

08:59.957 --> 09:01.207
Okay!

09:01.207 --> 09:03.207
You're on, DK...

09:03.625 --> 09:05.207
Let's drift!

09:05.207 --> 09:07.207
Drift! Drift!

09:07.750 --> 09:10.875
Don't matter what game you pick - you're gonna lose!

09:11.291 --> 09:13.625
Yeah, got that. Thanks.

09:15.625 --> 09:16.582
Great job, Brian.

09:16.582 --> 09:20.540
LIke I said - any game in the house, Brian.

09:36.082 --> 09:38.165
Dance Ex Machina.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.000
It's in the garage.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.291
Brian. Doodee!

09:46.291 --> 09:48.375
Everyone came to see us duel!

09:48.375 --> 09:50.125
But okay. Okay.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.625
If you wanna disco...

09:52.625 --> 09:54.666
Then let's...

09:55.291 --> 09:56.833
Tango.

09:56.832 --> 09:58.207
You really turned that around.

09:58.207 --> 10:00.665
Law never loses, Brian.

10:01.375 --> 10:03.832
To the garage everybody!

11:37.332 --> 11:39.375
I can't lose this game, Ted!

13:14.750 --> 13:15.666
Wow, ha!

13:15.666 --> 13:16.750
I mean, uh...

13:16.750 --> 13:18.291
I totally won, but...

13:18.291 --> 13:20.333
Can this guy dance or what?

13:22.457 --> 13:26.540
Way to cut a rug, studmuffin. This is gonna be more fun than I thought!

13:27.250 --> 13:31.332
Alright! Winning! Yeah... still won...

13:32.625 --> 13:36.707
That's great! That's what I did. I took that.

13:41.125 --> 13:42.916
Here.

13:42.916 --> 13:44.791
Oh thanks... - Syke!

13:44.791 --> 13:47.375
I guess we'll hold onto this for you - don't worry about it!

13:47.375 --> 13:50.832
Nay, the lady will have her game back!

13:52.832 --> 13:56.290
Or, shall I say... gömböc.

14:03.082 --> 14:07.957
Well played, old friend! Our paths shall cross again!

14:09.750 --> 14:11.750
DK!

14:13.875 --> 14:15.457
Ted! Look!

14:15.457 --> 14:17.165
It autosaved!

14:19.000 --> 14:20.707
Ted...?

14:23.750 --> 14:27.666
Boyfriend experiences extreme confusion after exposure to drift racing...

14:28.250 --> 14:29.791
"Boyfriend...?"

14:30.916 --> 14:32.083
Score!

14:34.957 --> 14:39.250
Man can you believe Jenny Matrix has a lame baby game chilling in her garage?

14:39.250 --> 14:41.166
What a loser...

14:41.166 --> 14:43.458
Oh! I'm sorry!

14:43.457 --> 14:46.332
Laugh it up. I'm still gonna murder you.

14:46.332 --> 14:48.207
Hey, if you wanna kill the life of the party...

14:48.500 --> 14:53.166
Ow! Careful - I'm gonna need my mouse arm for scrimmage tomorrow.

14:53.166 --> 14:57.500
Really? And what makes you think I'm gonna put you on my team?

14:59.541 --> 15:02.041
Well...

15:02.750 --> 15:07.125
That was all the fake confidence I could muster.

15:07.125 --> 15:08.750
That really hurt.

15:08.750 --> 15:11.750
I was supposed to choose someone like six hours ago anyway.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.625
Spot's yours if you want it.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.916
Really?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.000
Yeah, I'm...

15:19.416 --> 15:21.625
Totally! I'm...

15:21.791 --> 15:24.000
You know, whatever.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.041
I'm in.

15:26.041 --> 15:28.250
Won't let you down.

15:31.125 --> 15:34.541
I was thinking maybe after the scrim tomorrow.

15:34.541 --> 15:36.583
You and I wanna go grab a burger or...

15:36.582 --> 15:39.750
Oh hey there pricklepuss! Mind if I borrow my girlfriend for a second?

15:39.750 --> 15:42.875
Oh my God. Is this... is this a permanent...?

15:42.875 --> 15:45.207
Oh, why? Do you "like my 'stache?"

15:45.207 --> 15:47.290
Oh my God. - I had it made just for this.

15:47.291 --> 15:51.166
Oh my God. Ok, I have to go but I'll catch you later, Brian.

15:51.166 --> 15:54.625
Yeah, catch you later Brian. We gotta go see how making out feels with this.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.541
Oh! Brian!

15:59.541 --> 16:01.791
I remembered that thing! Jenny and Law are...

16:04.250 --> 16:07.500
Oh, daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn.
