"Oh, happy dagger!

00:14.639 --> 00:16.683
This is thy sheath.

00:16.766 --> 00:20.020
There rust, and let me die!"

00:20.103 --> 00:22.188
[groans]

00:23.273 --> 00:25.108
-That was great!
-[sighs] Thank you.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.986
Thank you very much.

00:28.069 --> 00:30.030
You have a slice of cheese
on your forehead.

00:30.989 --> 00:34.409
Uh... Well, flowers are traditional,

00:34.492 --> 00:36.286
but I'll accept cheese.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.414
[Alexa] Now that I had outed myself

00:39.497 --> 00:41.875
and people knew Katie
earned the role of Juliet,

00:41.958 --> 00:43.293
she was doing great.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.670
My life was a little more complicated.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.131
Ah, the useless-gift parade has begun.

00:48.506 --> 00:49.883
I got a sympathy fish.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.760
Say hello to Ricardo.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.847
I liked this a lot better
when it was happening to you.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.475
Oh, I love goldfish.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.642
He's all yours.

01:00.143 --> 01:04.022
Sorry, Ricardo. It's not you, it's me.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.108
[announcer] Attention, students.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.903
A reminder that yearbook pictures
are this Friday.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.572
Ooh! Yearbook photos!
OK, that will cheer you up.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.910
Also, a shout-out
to freshman Alexa Mendoza

01:16.993 --> 01:18.578
from all of us at Kennedy High.

01:18.953 --> 01:22.082
We just want you to know
that we're thinking of you every day.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.876
Stay strong, Alexa Mendoza.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.961
Stay strong.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.755
Could I stand out any more?

01:30.215 --> 01:31.216
Thanks.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.927
Well, at least I have a prom date.

-What's wrong?
-I don't know if I want my picture taken.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.887
What? You have to, OK?
It goes in the yearbook.

02:17.971 --> 02:18.972
Exactly.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.766
Fifty years from now, everyone will be
pointing me to grandkids,

02:21.850 --> 02:23.476
saying, "That's the sick girl."

02:24.060 --> 02:26.521
[sighs] I want to be remembered as me,

02:26.604 --> 02:28.898
but no one sees me as me.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.109
Uh-oh! Gwenny Thompson alert!

02:31.943 --> 02:33.653
Yes! Gwenny Thompson hates me.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.697
She's incapable of feeling sorry for me.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.949
I know she'll treat me like I'm me.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.033
Bring it on, Gwenny!

02:39.117 --> 02:40.535
-Alexa.
-[gasps]

02:42.787 --> 02:43.913
Gwenny.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.124
What a breath of foul air.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.377
Aw! I love that you still have
your spirit, happy girl.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.464
[grunts] What is she doing?
Did you put something on my back?

02:53.548 --> 02:55.008
Did you put something on my back?

02:55.091 --> 02:58.636
[laughs] Oh, I know we've had
our differences in the past,

02:58.720 --> 03:02.265
but your heroic journey
changes everything.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.350
No, it changes nothing!

03:04.434 --> 03:05.643
Everything is the same.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.312
You know what you are?

03:08.354 --> 03:11.274
You're a fighter. #HereForYou.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.821
-[Alexa] That was horrible.
-[Katie] That was so nice!

03:20.950 --> 03:22.368
[Alexa grunts]

03:26.456 --> 03:28.416
-Hi, honey.
-Big game tonight.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.584
But we have dinner plans.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.295
I'm kidding! [laughs]

03:32.795 --> 03:35.632
I know,
"Nobody talks to Dave during the game."

03:37.342 --> 03:40.970
I love you, hon, but it's the play-offs.
Remember how I got last year?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.180
[Dave chuckles]

03:45.892 --> 03:48.144
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was practicing not talking to you.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.563
What's that?

03:50.647 --> 03:53.316
Oh, someone dropped off
a cookie basket for Alexa.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.442
[Dave sniffs]

03:54.525 --> 03:56.778
Mm! That smell is driving me crazy.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.863
[gasps] Oh, and they're still warm.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.700
But we probably shouldn't open it
until Alexa gets home.

04:02.992 --> 04:03.993
No.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.496
Definitely not.

04:08.790 --> 04:13.503
But, you know, if one happened
to fall out of the basket by accident...

04:14.128 --> 04:15.713
By accident.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.508
[Dave grunts]

04:20.969 --> 04:21.970
[Lori grunts]

04:24.222 --> 04:25.723
[gasps] Oh!

04:25.807 --> 04:27.225
Oh, that's such a shame.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.309
Unfortunate.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.727
-Yeah.
-I split, you pick?

04:29.811 --> 04:30.645
Yeah.

04:30.728 --> 04:31.771
[both laugh]

04:31.854 --> 04:33.022
[Lori] Oh, thanks. Oh.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.315
Hi, sweetie.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.318
-You got a gift basket.
-Mm.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.281
-We're thinking of you while we eat.
-Mm-hmm.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.534
Cookies? Where does it end?

04:44.617 --> 04:47.287
Hey, no one sent me a cookie basket
when I had cancer.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.248
Uh... Who's it from?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.043
From Gwenny?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.336
[cookie thuds]

04:55.962 --> 04:57.547
No!

04:57.630 --> 04:59.215
Now she's in my house!

05:00.550 --> 05:02.969
-This basket is from Gwenny Thompson?
-Mm.

05:03.052 --> 05:06.723
You didn't tell me that! That's the girl
who egged our house last year.

05:07.598 --> 05:08.683
I forgive her.

05:10.768 --> 05:13.271
[sighs] I'm tossing these.
They're almost out of air.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.647
No, they're not. [gasps]

05:14.731 --> 05:16.524
Yeah. No, I see it now.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.989
The world is round,
Harry Styles secretly wants to marry me,

05:23.072 --> 05:24.782
and Gwenny Thompson hates me.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.076
These are the things we can count on.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.455
She's disrupted
the balance of the universe.

05:30.538 --> 05:34.125
Uh... I thought Harry Styles
wanted to secretly marry me.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.711
He secretly
just thinks of you as a friend.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.590
You know, you could finally
put this silly feud to rest.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.550
If Gwenny's being nice to you,

05:42.633 --> 05:44.427
you could try being nice to Gwenny.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.680
No, I can't do it.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.560
It's not that she's being nice to me,
it's why she's being nice to me.

05:53.186 --> 05:57.023
"Your heroic journey changes everything."
She's the worst!

05:58.191 --> 06:01.194
[Katie] Whoa. Fine. Look, forget Gwenny.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.030
OK, let's move on
to what we're wearing for our photos.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.823
-So, do I wear my--
-Your red shirt.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.784
No question. You just look good in red.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.702
I feel like that's true,

06:09.786 --> 06:12.497
but it's always nice
to hear someone else say it.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.501
So, I decided I am gonna take
my school photo.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.585
Oh, good.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.379
I just need to find something
that says who I am.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.798
Bald says, "I'm sick,"

06:21.881 --> 06:23.800
scarf says, "I'm covering up I'm sick,"

06:23.883 --> 06:26.135
and beanie says the same thing,
but with more style.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.013
[gasps] Ooh! Should I wear a beanie?

06:29.097 --> 06:31.390
I feel like we kind of moved on
from your look.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.353
So, I guess I'll just wear the wig, then.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.814
It's not really me,
but it's the closest I'll get.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.151
I'm a good-looking guy, right?

06:43.361 --> 06:45.863
Well, I mean,
I never really thought about it...

06:46.656 --> 06:48.741
but... yeah.

06:51.702 --> 06:52.995
Right.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.580
But my school photos,

06:54.664 --> 06:56.290
every year they're awful.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.669
Grades first through ten. It isn't pretty.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.671
Even though I am.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.383
I don't think you could take a bad pic--
Ah! Whoa!

07:05.466 --> 07:06.843
Why are you smiling like that?

07:08.052 --> 07:09.387
That's my picture smile.

07:09.470 --> 07:13.683
[chuckles] It's somewhere between,
"Who farted?" and, "I have to fart."

07:15.184 --> 07:17.645
I cannot have another
busted yearbook photo.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.897
Help me test new smiles
I've been working on.

07:20.314 --> 07:21.482
Sure.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.778
Oh, yes!

07:25.862 --> 07:28.114
Ooh! These look so good!

07:28.573 --> 07:30.616
Ooh, you're gonna love that one.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.869
Yeah, and great.

07:32.952 --> 07:33.953
And we're done.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.789
Ooh! So, how did they turn out?

07:36.873 --> 07:38.833
[chuckles] They were all selfies of me.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.752
And they were super cute.

07:42.670 --> 07:43.796
[Lucas] Hey!

07:46.215 --> 07:48.676
[commentator]
Welcome to Wrigley Field for today's...

07:48.759 --> 07:51.220
OK! Game time!

07:51.304 --> 07:52.847
Let's go, Nats!

07:52.930 --> 07:53.973
Cubs are going down!

07:54.056 --> 07:55.224
...and the Chicago Cubs.

07:55.308 --> 07:59.395
Hi! Uh... I know it's last minute,
but our TV broke.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.939
Any chance we could watch
the play-offs here?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.441
Absolutely! Come on in.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.611
Let's go, Cubs! Yeah!

08:06.694 --> 08:07.695
[Jack grunts]

08:09.363 --> 08:11.782
I forgot how much better
their TV is than ours.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.784
It's like we're in Best Buy.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.078
[Jennifer laughs]

08:16.162 --> 08:17.997
Oh, homemade guacamole!

08:18.498 --> 08:20.750
And are those mini crab cakes?

08:20.833 --> 08:21.834
Ooh! [chuckles]

08:21.918 --> 08:24.879
Uh... Lori, I forgot to talk to you
about that thing.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.467
Why did you tell them
they can watch with me?

08:30.801 --> 08:32.053
Oh, am I allowed to talk now?

08:35.681 --> 08:36.891
They're our friends.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.351
They're Cubs fans!

08:40.228 --> 08:43.814
So you're gonna tell an eight-year-old boy
he can't watch a baseball game?

08:44.982 --> 08:46.067
I was hoping you would.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.820
Let's go, Cubbies!

08:49.904 --> 08:52.365
Now, Jack, we're at the Mendozas' house,

08:52.448 --> 08:55.284
and if Dave wants to root for a team
that is inferior in every way,

08:55.368 --> 08:56.494
we have to respect that.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.578
[Dave chuckles]

08:58.079 --> 08:59.080
It's 0-1.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.207
Strike? Are you blind?

09:01.290 --> 09:03.918
[sighs] So, have you taken the TV
into the shop, or--

09:04.001 --> 09:05.086
Dave.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.922
[Dave sighs]

09:08.005 --> 09:09.298
This is nice.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.681
The janitor this morning asked me
if the hallways were warm enough

09:16.764 --> 09:19.308
and then gave me a sweater
from the lost-and-found.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.936
It was nice and I kept it, but still...

09:22.687 --> 09:23.688
I'm sorry.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.064
But on the plus side,

09:25.147 --> 09:27.108
now that people know why I shaved my head,

09:27.191 --> 09:28.568
I'm looking like a real hero.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.570
-Alexa.
-[gasps]

09:31.404 --> 09:32.405
Gwenny.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.575
How do you walk so quietly on those claws?

09:35.658 --> 09:38.202
[laughs] LOL! I got you something.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.581
-This had better be a bag of snakes.
-You're so funny!

09:42.039 --> 09:45.459
I know how hard it must have been
not being able to go out for basketball,

09:45.543 --> 09:47.461
so I had this made for you.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.130
We want you to remember...

09:49.755 --> 09:52.508
you'll always be the point guard
of our hearts.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.597
-That's nice.
-Nice?

09:57.680 --> 09:59.265
It's a sympathy jersey!

09:59.348 --> 10:01.601
You're my enemy and I'm yours.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.894
So do us both a favor: drop the act,

10:03.978 --> 10:06.188
and just go back
to your normal horrible self.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.524
Aw! Poor thing.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.319
Me being here
is causing you stress, so I'll go.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.528
Enjoy the jersey.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.780
[scoffs] Yeah, I won't!

10:14.864 --> 10:17.283
You know, i-it's stupid and I hate it!

10:18.326 --> 10:19.327
[grunts]

10:21.329 --> 10:22.371
[grunts]

10:23.789 --> 10:26.125
What is this thing made of?

10:26.667 --> 10:27.668
[Alexa sighs]

10:28.753 --> 10:31.756
I need some part of my school life
to be normal,

10:31.839 --> 10:33.716
and that part is going to be Gwenny.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.428
-So you know what I'm gonna bring back?
-Leg warmers?

10:39.722 --> 10:40.723
The prank war.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.475
Oh, no, not the prank war.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.352
No, I'm doing Gwenny a favor.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.437
OK, she's miserable being nice to me.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.814
So now we have to think up
a bunch of pranks?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.358
[scoffs] "Think up"?

10:53.986 --> 10:56.447
OK. "Lucas pranks, Mom pranks."

10:56.530 --> 10:58.324
-Oh, here, "Gwenny."
-Oh, wait.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.910
[chuckles] Did I see my name on there?

11:01.452 --> 11:03.829
That's... a different Katie.

11:12.463 --> 11:16.342
[commentator] And with that infield hit,
that puts the tying run in the hold...

11:16.759 --> 11:19.303
But there are two outs here
in the bottom of the ninth.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.556
5-1, our score. Nationals are up by four.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.142
Evers is now the runner in second base.
Steinfeld...

11:25.226 --> 11:27.728
Our guest would like another juice box.

11:28.437 --> 11:31.023
At the ballpark,
they cut you off after the seventh inning.

11:32.775 --> 11:33.776
Hey, Mom.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.694
Check out this new smile.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.530
I call it "October Chill."

11:40.783 --> 11:41.992
Yeah, not your best.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.953
Nice face. Who farted?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.332
Honey, I just don't get it.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.750
You're so handsome.

11:49.834 --> 11:50.835
I know.

11:50.918 --> 11:54.380
[sighs] No matter what I do, I come out
looking like some kind of forest animal.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.133
OK, well,
you've got to keep working at it,

11:57.216 --> 12:01.011
because as you go through life, you need
a special smile for every occasion.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.514
-Hmm.
-This is my Christmas smile.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.770
This is my roller coaster smile.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.608
That's right, Jack! How does it taste?

12:14.692 --> 12:15.943
[laughs]

12:16.485 --> 12:19.905
And this is my "your father is fighting
with an eight-year-old" smile.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.034
They do have the bases loaded.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.538
Fastball... Swung on.
It's up high. Is it gonna get...

12:27.621 --> 12:30.040
-Come on, come on, come on!
-No, no, no!

12:30.124 --> 12:31.584
And that will clear the bases!

12:31.667 --> 12:32.501
Yes!

12:32.585 --> 12:34.128
Tying run on second!

12:34.211 --> 12:38.966
Evers has scored. Steinfeld has scored.
Here comes Chance.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.844
And just like that, it's 5-4!

12:41.927 --> 12:42.928
Now, Jack...

12:44.638 --> 12:45.639
Jack!

12:46.140 --> 12:47.516
We talked about this.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.519
We've been invited to watch the game here
as guests of Dave.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.938
-We should appreciate his generosity.
-Thank you.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.441
You're very welcome,
and you're out of hummus.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.779
I-I'll just...
I'll have a mini taco instead.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.867
He swings at the first pitch,
a lazy fly ball to the right...

13:04.950 --> 13:07.620
-Catch it! Catch it! Catch it!
-It's going! It's going!

13:07.703 --> 13:09.705
-No!
-Yes!

13:09.788 --> 13:11.332
[laughs]

13:11.415 --> 13:14.168
Whoo! That's the game, baby!

13:14.251 --> 13:16.879
Oh! Oh! Oh!

13:16.962 --> 13:18.797
Nats win! Nats win!

13:18.881 --> 13:21.800
How does that feel, little man?
Whoo! Whoo!

13:21.884 --> 13:24.261
It burns! It bu-- [grunts]

13:24.345 --> 13:25.930
You know, because the Nationals won.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.223
[laughs]

13:27.306 --> 13:30.768
Yeah, you see, he's a Cubs fan, so, uh...

13:31.310 --> 13:32.311
[exhales]

13:34.897 --> 13:37.942
All in good fun. Right, guy? [chuckles]

13:39.944 --> 13:42.029
There's still a game five.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.365
You're a grown man.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.575
You should be ashamed of yourself.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.877
See you tomorrow. Jack, get the door.

14:06.637 --> 14:07.471
OK.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.473
I know her better than she knows herself.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.518
The real Gwenny is still in there.
We just have to pull her out.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.527
[flatulence]

15:27.593 --> 15:30.054
[sighs] A year ago,
the whoopee cushion thing alone

15:30.137 --> 15:32.348
would have sent Gwenny
into full-on revenge mode.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.724
We need to turn up the heat.

15:33.807 --> 15:37.770
You're driving yourself crazy
just to get Gwenny to be mean to you?

15:37.853 --> 15:40.522
Goldfish and teddy bears
from strangers are one thing,

15:40.606 --> 15:43.025
but kindness
from Gwenny Thompson is wrong.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.860
It's just wrong.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.865
My world has turned upside down and
it's up to me to turn it right-side up.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.617
OK.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.662
Well, it sounds like
you've got this figured out.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.998
[groans] And I'm back in.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.382
What if Mrs. Calhoun finds out
you kidnapped Murray from the science lab?

16:06.924 --> 16:10.260
A woman who names a tarantula
has made an attachment.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.600
Whoa. You know Gwenny's combination?

16:17.351 --> 16:19.979
You are a scary, scary woman.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.439
[chuckles] Thank you.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.362
Gwenny's gonna kill you.

16:28.862 --> 16:29.989
I know!

16:30.072 --> 16:32.116
And everything will feel normal again.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.201
-[bell rings]
-Showtime!

16:42.751 --> 16:44.586
-Hey, Cameron.
-Oh, hey, Gwenny.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.174
[locker opens]

16:54.138 --> 16:55.347
Dude, do not move!

16:55.597 --> 16:58.517
OK. Someone wants to keep
the conversation going.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.021
Imagine the biggest spider
you've ever seen.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.816
Then imagine it on your shoulder,
because that's what's happening.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.571
[screams]

17:12.948 --> 17:14.408
[Alexa laughs]

17:14.908 --> 17:18.829
Good boy! Who's a good boy?

17:20.205 --> 17:22.124
Whoa. That is messed up.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.209
I've got to go.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.798
You put a tarantula in my locker?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.842
I did. What are you gonna do about it?

17:31.925 --> 17:33.469
I'm going to...

17:34.094 --> 17:37.389
remember that you
are dealing with so much.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.559
I'm on Team Alexa.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.648
[sighs] What's the point?

17:46.732 --> 17:50.027
Gwenny will never treat me the same way.
Everyone just feels sorry for me.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.445
That's not true.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.947
[Alexa] Oh, really? Look at my locker.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.241
Maybe this should be my yearbook photo.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.702
Come on, come on.
Um... Let's try another prank.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.162
Just forget it.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.997
[sighs] Alexa.

18:06.460 --> 18:10.005
Gwenny! Gwenny,
can't you please retaliate against Alexa?

18:10.089 --> 18:13.926
Don't you think I want to? I can't be seen
being mean to a girl with cancer!

18:14.760 --> 18:16.303
What would people think of me?

18:17.638 --> 18:19.515
Oh, well, if it helps,

18:19.598 --> 18:21.225
not that many people like you.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.978
[sighs] Come on, Gwenny.

18:25.062 --> 18:29.441
You've got to do something evil and awful.
It will make you feel better.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.360
I know.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.278
Nope.

18:33.862 --> 18:37.783
I'm going to go home and steam
my new dress for picture day tomorrow.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.785
Steaming things calms me.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.496
I can't control the world;
I can control the wrinkles.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.335
I know how to bring back
the old Gwenny, Murray.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.546
Murray?

18:51.255 --> 18:52.256
OK, where did he go?

18:52.756 --> 18:55.008
OK, he couldn't have gone very far.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.177
Murray?

18:57.761 --> 18:58.804
Murray, buddy?

19:00.973 --> 19:01.974
Oh, Murray?

19:03.517 --> 19:04.518
Murray?

19:05.644 --> 19:06.645
Murray?

19:09.189 --> 19:11.984
[commentator] And the dish is...
grounded out towards short stop.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.610
-No!
-[Jack cheers]

19:13.694 --> 19:14.695
Jack.

19:14.778 --> 19:15.779
Dave.

19:16.905 --> 19:19.116
That was an unfortunate turn of events.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.828
[restrained] Woo hoo!

19:26.582 --> 19:28.458
I think I solved
my yearbook picture problem.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.668
Oh, good!

19:29.751 --> 19:30.961
I'm not taking one.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.796
I just can't find the right smile.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.674
It's a shame that future people
won't know what...

19:36.550 --> 19:38.093
what this really looked like.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.931
OK. No, you're not giving up, all right?
We're practicing right now.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.851
All right.
Give me your most beautiful smile.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.021
OK. Honey, you're not even trying!

19:49.104 --> 19:51.732
Come on. Is this what you want
to look like in your yearbook?

19:52.858 --> 19:53.942
Yes!

19:55.736 --> 19:56.737
This is it.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.699
This look says,
"I've got something on my mind."

20:03.118 --> 20:04.995
And what exactly is that?

20:06.371 --> 20:08.081
I have no idea.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.418
Erikson pitches--

20:11.501 --> 20:13.170
Oh, come on!

20:13.253 --> 20:16.173
That's gonna be out.
Number 2, on the infield grass.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.341
Enjoying yourself?

20:17.424 --> 20:18.967
[hums tune]

20:19.051 --> 20:21.678
How about we make this more fun?
Want to bet an ice cream cone?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.931
[chuckles] An ice cream cone?

20:24.014 --> 20:25.349
Lame-o!

20:26.850 --> 20:28.852
Oh, yeah, Cubs fan?
What do you have in mind?

20:28.936 --> 20:30.354
Oh, I don't bet. [chuckles]

20:30.854 --> 20:31.939
Any more.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.191
I know.

20:34.274 --> 20:37.527
The loser has to paint his face
the winning team's colors tomorrow.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.696
And keep it on the whole day.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.781
[chuckles]

20:40.864 --> 20:42.324
You'll look good in red and white.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.705
A base hit wins the series for the Nats.
An out...

20:48.789 --> 20:50.040
I can't watch!

20:50.123 --> 20:50.958
Oh, come on!

20:51.041 --> 20:52.626
Swung on looping line drive!

20:52.709 --> 20:54.002
Go! Go, go, go!

20:54.086 --> 20:55.087
He's out!

20:55.170 --> 20:59.549
An amazing catch over the shoulder
by Dwayne Woodard! I can't believe it!

20:59.633 --> 21:01.510
The Cubs win the series!

21:01.593 --> 21:02.970
Aren't you gonna celebrate?

21:03.929 --> 21:04.972
No.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.974
You've been a wonderful host.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.977
Let's go, Jack. Let's be gracious winners.

21:10.894 --> 21:13.355
-Thank you.
-No, Dave, thank you.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.235
[door opens and closes]

21:18.318 --> 21:19.820
[euphoric cheering]

21:19.903 --> 21:21.154
[Jack] Cubbies win!

21:21.238 --> 21:23.657
[both chanting] Cubs! Cubs! Cubs!

21:23.740 --> 21:25.784
[Jack] Whoo! We made it!

21:25.867 --> 21:27.703
[cheering continues]

21:31.707 --> 21:33.208
Gwenny is ready to break.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.502
One more prank
will push her over the edge.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.797
And I just need you to be my lookout.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.799
Ooh! So, what's the prank?

21:41.174 --> 21:42.175
I...

21:43.051 --> 21:45.095
am going to destroy...

21:45.595 --> 21:47.180
Gwenny's picture-day dress.

21:48.849 --> 21:49.850
There!

21:51.435 --> 21:54.396
-That's it?
-It won't tie at the top now!

21:54.479 --> 21:56.231
Bam! [chuckles]

21:56.315 --> 21:58.734
OK, now I slip it back in her locker

21:58.817 --> 22:01.486
with a fake note I wrote from Alexa,
taking credit.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.740
Status quo restored,
Alexa happy. [chuckles]

22:04.823 --> 22:07.034
OK, this prank doesn't require a lookout.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.493
It barely requires you.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.287
[Katie scoffs]

22:10.370 --> 22:13.165
OK, this is a great prank,

22:13.248 --> 22:16.293
and will be talked about
wherever people talk about pranks.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.712
OK, get my fake note. Oh, no, no, no.

22:18.795 --> 22:19.629
[gasps]

22:29.681 --> 22:30.682
[lock clicks]

22:33.310 --> 22:34.603
Whoa!

22:34.686 --> 22:36.146
-No, no, no, no!
-[flushes]

22:36.229 --> 22:37.230
No!

22:38.065 --> 22:39.816
No! Come on!

22:39.900 --> 22:40.901
[grunts]

22:40.984 --> 22:42.069
Give it back!

22:42.444 --> 22:43.445
[grunts]

22:45.322 --> 22:47.991
Oh, no! No, no, no.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.285
[retches]

22:55.499 --> 22:57.292
No! No, no, no.

22:57.667 --> 23:01.421
No. No! Pranks are awful!

23:01.505 --> 23:03.090
Then why do people like this?

23:03.173 --> 23:04.174
[bell rings]

23:04.591 --> 23:05.592
[gasps]

23:20.107 --> 23:21.108
[Gwenny] I...

23:21.483 --> 23:22.484
cannot...

23:22.567 --> 23:24.319
believe her!

23:24.402 --> 23:25.695
Oh, I'm so done!

23:26.196 --> 23:32.077
Do not mess
with Gwyneth Ernestine Thompson!

23:32.160 --> 23:33.578
[Gwenny screams]

23:33.662 --> 23:34.955
[Gwenny panting]

23:40.544 --> 23:41.419
What happened?

23:42.003 --> 23:43.588
Well... [clears throat]

23:43.672 --> 23:46.591
...I have good news and bad news.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.885
Good news is Gwenny hates you again.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.513
Seriously? That's awesome!

23:51.763 --> 23:52.889
Yes, yes.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.225
And um...

23:55.308 --> 23:57.894
And keep that in mind
when you hear the bad news.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.856
This is how much she hates you again.

24:03.567 --> 24:04.776
Oh, my God!

24:04.860 --> 24:07.320
Wait, I-I have to take my photo
next period!

24:07.404 --> 24:09.239
I know. I'll stall the photographer.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.782
I-I can call in a fake fire.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.325
I'll set a fire!

24:12.826 --> 24:13.827
Whoa, now!

24:14.953 --> 24:17.831
I have to call my mom.
Maybe she can get a new wig before then.

24:24.838 --> 24:25.839
Katie!

24:32.220 --> 24:34.890
I hope my mom makes it.
We only have five minutes left.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.642
[sighs] I can't believe I did this to you.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.019
Are you kidding?

24:39.102 --> 24:42.939
You got Gwenny back to normal
by doing a prank, which you hate.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.733
And you did it for me.

24:45.775 --> 24:46.902
You're amazing.

24:47.569 --> 24:48.612
And a little scary.

24:48.695 --> 24:49.738
[Katie chuckles]

24:49.821 --> 24:50.906
Thank you.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.825
[sighs] Come on, Mom.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.452
[Dave] Make way! Hot wig!

24:55.535 --> 24:57.162
Got a hot wig coming through!

24:57.704 --> 24:59.080
-[Lori] Door!
-[Dave] Got it!

25:02.375 --> 25:03.543
Oh, you made it!

25:04.044 --> 25:05.921
Yeah. Wait, so what happened to you?

25:06.379 --> 25:07.422
What happened to Dad?

25:08.673 --> 25:09.799
Jack's a jerk.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.428
-Hey, thank you both.
-Yeah.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.764
-[Dave] OK.
-[Lori] OK.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.142
-Hey, another Cubs fan--
-No, I am not a Cubs fan!

25:19.643 --> 25:20.769
I hate the Cubs!

25:21.394 --> 25:22.812
Stop looking at me!

25:24.064 --> 25:26.608
-OK.
-I've got to go home with him.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.951
You know how hard
I was trying to be nice to you?

25:36.034 --> 25:38.912
-But you just couldn't let it be.
-Because it wasn't you.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.498
And the only thing worse than you
is a fake you.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.708
Well, congratulations.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.669
Being sick hasn't changed you a bit.

25:45.752 --> 25:48.546
You are exactly the same person
as you were before.

25:49.589 --> 25:50.590
Thank you.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.801
You're welcome.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.306
-You owe me a dress.
-You owe me a wig.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.188
Alexa Mendoza, you're next.

26:14.155 --> 26:15.865
OK. Ready?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.243
On my count.

26:18.326 --> 26:20.537
One... two...

26:21.871 --> 26:24.165
You know what? I need a second.

26:29.963 --> 26:33.675
[Alexa] It's hard to feel like yourself
when no one treats you like yourself.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.678
I may have been a girl with cancer,
but I was still me.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.680
Both things were true.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.849
And this is what I looked like.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.102
[chuckles] Oh, and I almost forgot,

26:44.185 --> 26:47.147
that wasn't even
the most memorable photo that year.
