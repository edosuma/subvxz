WEBVTT

00:02.338 --> 00:03.841
-Previously on Monarch...
-Listen, hoss,

00:04.109 --> 00:06.147
this truth-teller Rick Rubin
act of yours

00:06.213 --> 00:07.582
is starting to wear
a little thin.

00:07.616 --> 00:10.321
Thought that was the exact
reason that you called me.

00:10.422 --> 00:12.894
According to the DNA results,

00:12.994 --> 00:14.530
that woman's our sister.

00:14.596 --> 00:16.467
Two weeks ago
I was in Albuquerque

00:16.534 --> 00:20.910
studying for my chem finals,
and now I'm here with you.

00:21.043 --> 00:22.612
You think I was gonna
sit back quietly

00:22.714 --> 00:23.949
and let you take
every single thing

00:24.049 --> 00:24.884
I've worked for
my entire life?

00:24.984 --> 00:27.089
You'll do anything
to get what you want,

00:27.155 --> 00:28.926
and you don't care
who you hurt.

00:28.992 --> 00:30.896
<i>KAYLA:</i>
<i>I love Gigi.</i>

00:30.963 --> 00:32.632
We have to stop this.

00:33.736 --> 00:35.906
NICKY:
You're not eating sushi
and you're not drinking sake.

00:35.973 --> 00:37.609
How far along are you?

00:39.079 --> 00:40.014
We found some blood in the car.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.317
<i>Now, that makes you</i>

00:41.417 --> 00:44.223
<i>the prime suspect in</i>
<i>Clive's disappearance.</i>

00:44.356 --> 00:45.625
My hands are tied.

00:45.693 --> 00:48.197
I suggest you figure out a way
to untie 'em.

00:48.297 --> 00:51.203
And let's not forget
who owes who here, Tripp.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.553
So, we have a sister?

00:59.620 --> 01:01.624
Well, technically a half sister.

01:01.725 --> 01:04.697
Albie Roman-- that man is
a lockbox of secrets

01:04.764 --> 01:06.367
in a ten-gallon hat.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.171
I did not get that square
on the Roman family

01:08.237 --> 01:09.606
drama bingo card.

01:09.741 --> 01:12.446
(chuckles) Look, all I know is,
we need to get ahead of this.

01:12.512 --> 01:15.218
Control the narrative
before it goes public.

01:15.285 --> 01:16.922
You know how fast we would go

01:17.022 --> 01:19.894
from country royalty to
a tabloid joke if this gets out?

01:19.961 --> 01:22.834
It won't, 'cause if there's
one thing this family knows

01:22.900 --> 01:23.669
how to do, it's hide the truth.

01:23.769 --> 01:27.008
And Catt. That woman
has an agenda.

01:27.075 --> 01:29.079
Like Mama always said,
if you know what someone wants,

01:29.146 --> 01:30.315
you don't need to trust 'em.

01:30.415 --> 01:32.119
I'm sorry, I don't speak
fluent Dottie Roman.

01:32.185 --> 01:34.256
Well, Catt wants
her daughter to be a star.

01:34.323 --> 01:35.558
To destroy us doesn't help.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.763
It's gonna make one hell
of a podcast someday.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.533
NICKY:
But Luke's right.
Our family needs to

01:39.600 --> 01:43.074
circle the wagons and fly
under the radar for a while.

01:43.141 --> 01:46.480
That might be a bit difficult
right now. For good reason.

01:46.547 --> 01:49.754
Country Music's "40 Under 40"
list just came out.

01:49.821 --> 01:52.860
It's the hottest up-and-comers
from Austin to Nashville.

01:52.960 --> 01:53.729
So lame.

01:53.796 --> 01:55.231
And what's that got
to do with us?

01:55.298 --> 01:57.435
Because Gigi made the list.

01:57.502 --> 01:58.672
Me?

01:58.739 --> 02:01.243
-Congratulations, Geeg.
-And by lame,

02:01.343 --> 02:02.780
I meant incredible.

02:02.814 --> 02:04.516
That is a very
well-deserved honor.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.556
So I was thinking Monarch
could host it this year

02:07.656 --> 02:09.059
to celebrate.
What do you think?

02:09.126 --> 02:11.664
Well, I say hell yeah.

02:24.189 --> 02:26.026
Albie.

02:26.093 --> 02:27.429
So, what brings you downtown?

02:27.529 --> 02:32.405
Well... I might've come on
a little strong the other night.

02:32.506 --> 02:35.512
Eh, you were looking out
for your own.

02:35.612 --> 02:39.019
I would expect nothing less
from Albie Roman.

02:39.086 --> 02:40.789
So we're good, then?

02:42.225 --> 02:43.896
I didn't say that.

02:45.598 --> 02:47.269
There was blood
in your son-in-law's car,

02:47.335 --> 02:49.406
and Clive's still missing.

02:49.473 --> 02:52.512
Our friendship doesn't
change those facts.

02:54.516 --> 02:56.153
Well, then how
about these facts?

02:56.287 --> 02:59.660
There's more than just
friendship between us.

02:59.727 --> 03:01.197
There's history.

03:01.263 --> 03:02.900
Don't you forget that.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.104
Or what?

03:06.140 --> 03:08.845
Or you know how this ends.

03:08.912 --> 03:11.483
That's something neither one
of us wants.

03:13.154 --> 03:15.525
(door opens)

03:16.560 --> 03:17.797
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

03:17.830 --> 03:21.237
DNA came back on the blood we
found in his son-in-law's car.

03:21.337 --> 03:23.407
And?

03:23.507 --> 03:25.846
It's not Clive Grayson's.

03:25.946 --> 03:27.349
Not Albie Roman's either.

03:27.482 --> 03:30.355
Yeah, I figured as much.

03:30.421 --> 03:32.325
He's trying to protect
one of his kids.

03:32.392 --> 03:37.803
Now, all we got to do is
figure out which one.

03:38.772 --> 03:40.743
♪ ♪

03:47.857 --> 03:48.992
I can't believe
I'm choosing a dress

03:49.026 --> 03:52.499
for Gigi being named on that
stupid "40 Under 40" list.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.104
The whole construct reeks
of ageism.

03:55.204 --> 03:56.140
-Mm-hmm.
-I mean, come on.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.944
Who cares about a list anyway?

03:58.010 --> 04:00.648
Mama was on that list
a long time ago.

04:00.716 --> 04:01.685
I just thought it would be me

04:01.751 --> 04:04.256
that'd be following in her
footsteps, not Geeg.

04:04.356 --> 04:06.728
I've worked so hard
for so long.

04:06.795 --> 04:09.366
And Open Horizon still hasn't
greenlit my tour.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.873
Well, maybe you don't need
to tour on your own.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.576
I heard something.

04:14.677 --> 04:18.551
-I shouldn't say, it was told
to me in confidence, so...
-(chuckles) Earl.

04:18.618 --> 04:20.355
When I was in Nashville
last week

04:20.421 --> 04:22.793
doing Kelsea's hair,
she said that she

04:22.893 --> 04:25.799
and LeAnn and Maren were gonna
do a few dates together.

04:25.866 --> 04:29.539
-They're calling themselves
the Yellow Roses.
-Ooh.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.347
Anyhow, looks like Maren
dropped out.

04:33.414 --> 04:34.851
They're looking for a third.

04:34.951 --> 04:37.355
It's a perfect opportunity
for you.

04:37.422 --> 04:39.159
So maybe I should go talk to...

04:39.226 --> 04:41.998
Luke, I need a word.

04:42.065 --> 04:44.269
Why? Got some more
long-lost relatives

04:44.336 --> 04:45.571
you need to tell me about?

04:45.638 --> 04:47.309
Maren Morris is taking
a sabbatical

04:47.375 --> 04:49.579
from the Yellow Roses, which
leaves a space on the tour.

04:49.646 --> 04:51.650
I mean, that,
that has to be me.

04:51.718 --> 04:54.189
I haven't heard that.
Where you getting that from?

04:54.289 --> 04:55.591
Did Earl tell you that?

04:55.693 --> 04:56.828
He knows everything.

04:56.928 --> 04:58.699
-He's like the TMZ
of country music.
-Yeah.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.903
TMZ in elaborate
floral shirts.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.572
I need this, Luke.

05:02.605 --> 05:04.276
It's an opportunity for me
to show Open Horizon

05:04.343 --> 05:06.013
that I'm ready.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.019
It might be the only way.

05:09.119 --> 05:09.921
Well, uh,

05:09.988 --> 05:12.292
I know the tour manager,
so, I mean,

05:12.359 --> 05:13.795
I could set you up a meeting,

05:13.862 --> 05:16.567
but you're gonna have
to seal the deal yourself.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.972
You bring him there,
I'll do the rest.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.986
Good, you're here.

05:26.086 --> 05:28.190
I've been poring through
your new cuts all night.

05:28.290 --> 05:31.798
They got heart, anger and hope.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.369
And this album, it could be
your best work.

05:34.503 --> 05:35.806
But?

05:35.873 --> 05:37.843
But it's missing something.

05:37.910 --> 05:40.783
That one track that ties
all those themes together.

05:40.849 --> 05:42.652
If we're gonna keep
our release schedule,

05:42.720 --> 05:44.589
it's got to go to Luke today.
The album's fine.

05:44.691 --> 05:47.162
Since when is "fine" good enough
for Albie Roman?

05:47.228 --> 05:49.232
Got a lot on my mind.

05:49.299 --> 05:51.203
My life ain't just about music.

05:51.270 --> 05:53.140
Well, then tap into that.

05:53.207 --> 05:56.480
Look, you got to find something
that, that you wish you did

05:56.547 --> 05:57.783
or wish you never did.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.787
But you got to dig deep down
to that place

05:59.854 --> 06:01.925
that you can barely stand
where you tell the raw,

06:02.025 --> 06:03.661
unvarnished truth
about who the hell

06:03.729 --> 06:05.799
Albie Roman really is.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.837
You bleed onto this paper,

06:07.937 --> 06:10.341
that's when the album
will be done.

09:55.959 --> 09:58.163
Sometimes you got to show
the world who you are.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.633
(country music playing
on jukebox)

09:59.734 --> 10:02.305
LUKE:
Sounds good.

10:02.372 --> 10:05.144
Yep, see you.

10:05.912 --> 10:07.983
Well, what'd he say?

10:08.050 --> 10:11.523
Artistry. Stage presence.
Sex appeal.

10:11.590 --> 10:12.960
He said you had it all.

10:13.027 --> 10:15.832
And he could definitely see you
as third Rose.

10:15.899 --> 10:18.537
-Good. That's amazing.
-But...

10:18.637 --> 10:21.143
Earl, uh, didn't have
the whole story.

10:21.209 --> 10:23.013
Kelsea and LeAnn already have
somebody in mind

10:23.113 --> 10:26.353
-for the tour.
-Who?

10:26.420 --> 10:28.257
Gigi.

10:30.528 --> 10:32.198
Okay.

10:42.886 --> 10:44.957
I just came to make sure
everything was okay between us.

10:45.057 --> 10:46.961
Well, yeah.
Why wouldn't it be?

10:47.028 --> 10:49.099
Luke said your performance
was amazing.

10:49.165 --> 10:50.702
-Yeah.
-I know how much you wanted

10:50.836 --> 10:52.538
to be a part
of the Yellow Roses.

10:52.638 --> 10:54.509
Well, at least they get
one Roman.

10:54.576 --> 10:56.113
When do you ship out?

10:56.213 --> 10:58.818
Supposed to leave next week,
but...

10:58.885 --> 10:59.954
But what?

11:00.021 --> 11:01.023
Can I really even go?

11:01.089 --> 11:03.695
With Kayla being pregnant,
and Summer needing me

11:03.762 --> 11:04.662
more all the time,
I just don't know

11:04.730 --> 11:07.068
if it's right to leave
my family right now.

11:07.135 --> 11:08.203
Geeg, it's the Yellow Roses.

11:08.303 --> 11:09.339
I mean, like, they're
the biggest

11:09.406 --> 11:10.374
country stars in the world,
and if you join them,

11:10.474 --> 11:13.414
that makes you one of
the biggest country stars

11:13.480 --> 11:14.449
in the world.

11:14.516 --> 11:16.319
I know.
It's a dream come true.

11:16.386 --> 11:17.121
Well, is it?

11:17.221 --> 11:19.059
'Cause most people
in your position

11:19.125 --> 11:19.894
wouldn't hesitate,
particularly when

11:19.960 --> 11:21.931
it's been handed
to 'em on a platter.

11:22.031 --> 11:23.167
What's that supposed to mean?

11:23.233 --> 11:25.237
Well, do you know what I would
do to be in your position?

11:25.304 --> 11:27.341
I would... (sighs)
Basically what I've been doing

11:27.408 --> 11:29.680
my entire life, but...

11:29.747 --> 11:31.951
For a shot like this?

11:33.120 --> 11:36.493
Your time will come, Nicky.
I know it.

11:38.597 --> 11:40.936
Just don't give up.

11:42.405 --> 11:45.511
Yeah. Never.

11:52.091 --> 11:54.195
<i>ANA:</i>
<i>You're Albie Roman's daughter?</i>

11:54.295 --> 11:57.301
Mija, mija,
please let me explain.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.506
Go for it.
Explain why you have been

11:59.572 --> 12:01.643
lying to me for my entire life.

12:01.677 --> 12:02.913
I can't wait to hear it.

12:03.046 --> 12:05.184
I was just trying
to protect you.

12:05.284 --> 12:07.956
That's good,
the protection angle.

12:08.056 --> 12:10.461
How long have you been
working on that?

12:11.229 --> 12:13.233
I understand why you're angry,
but I didn't know

12:13.300 --> 12:15.404
what kind of people the Romans
were when we got here.

12:15.471 --> 12:17.475
If they could be trusted,
how they would react.

12:17.575 --> 12:20.916
All I knew is that you're
extremely talented,

12:20.982 --> 12:22.151
and I needed them to see it.

12:22.251 --> 12:24.757
And now you've ruined it.
Do you get that?

12:24.824 --> 12:26.293
I'll never know
if they only signed me

12:26.426 --> 12:29.099
-because I'm a Roman.
-No, I swear,

12:29.165 --> 12:30.769
they didn't know who
we were when we got here.

12:30.836 --> 12:32.338
You did that all on your own.

12:32.438 --> 12:35.912
Now I know why you were giving
me so much crap about Ace.

12:36.012 --> 12:38.785
He's adopted, by the way,
so it shouldn't even matter.

12:38.885 --> 12:41.022
But you're just like them.
All you care about

12:41.123 --> 12:42.058
is how things look.

12:42.191 --> 12:44.395
Oh, no, you know
that's not true.

12:44.462 --> 12:45.664
Honestly,

12:45.765 --> 12:48.637
I have no idea
what's true anymore.

12:49.740 --> 12:51.510
Ana!

12:54.582 --> 12:55.919
Can I be honest
with you, Earl?

12:55.986 --> 12:57.221
Well, it depends.

12:57.321 --> 12:58.490
Is it about my crow's-feet?

12:58.557 --> 13:00.528
(laughs):
No.

13:00.594 --> 13:02.966
It's about the Yellow Roses.

13:03.033 --> 13:07.341
I just... I don't think
it's fair sometimes.

13:07.441 --> 13:10.614
It isn't. That's why you just
can't roll over in defeat.

13:10.682 --> 13:13.220
You got to marshal your forces.
You got to make a plan.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.026
I had a plan. It was
to blow their managers away.

13:16.092 --> 13:19.499
And I did, but they just...
they liked Gigi better.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.938
That's 'cause Gigi's fun
and she's sweet.

13:22.004 --> 13:23.574
She's the kind of girl
you want to have a beer

13:23.640 --> 13:24.476
and a burger with.

13:24.677 --> 13:27.749
But, sweetie, who wants a burger
when you can have

13:27.816 --> 13:29.152
a filet mignon?

13:29.252 --> 13:30.488
Stop.

13:30.554 --> 13:32.693
You know what your mother
would have done

13:32.759 --> 13:33.962
under these circumstances?

13:34.028 --> 13:35.464
No, but I'm afraid
you're gonna tell me.

13:35.531 --> 13:38.705
Ooh, Dottie would have set
their heads on straight,

13:38.771 --> 13:41.042
by any means necessary.

13:43.915 --> 13:45.785
You saying I should
screw over my sister?

13:45.886 --> 13:48.290
I'm not saying that,
I'm just saying

13:48.390 --> 13:51.731
your mama didn't become an icon
by playing nice.

13:51.797 --> 13:53.100
And neither will you.

14:08.363 --> 14:10.601
Hey. Dad.

14:10.634 --> 14:13.207
Open the door.
(sighs)

14:13.307 --> 14:14.810
What do you want?
I'm writing.

14:14.877 --> 14:16.413
(scoffs)
What do you mean <i>writing?</i>

14:16.513 --> 14:19.018
Album's due today. I'm here
for the listening session.

14:19.085 --> 14:20.187
I got one last track to do.

14:20.221 --> 14:21.590
Hey! All right. Well, then,

14:21.656 --> 14:23.293
let me hear what you have.

14:23.393 --> 14:24.797
Dad, I'm supposed to be
taking this

14:24.897 --> 14:26.433
to the marketing team today.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.604
It might be helpful if the CEO
of your label

14:28.738 --> 14:30.140
knew what he was marketing.

14:30.241 --> 14:32.144
You and the rest of your
kiss-ass execs

14:32.245 --> 14:33.580
can all hear it when it's done.

14:33.647 --> 14:36.519
-Today ain't over with yet.
-This is...

14:41.563 --> 14:42.733
(knocks on door)

14:46.172 --> 14:48.543
Hey. This is a surprise.

14:48.644 --> 14:49.813
Is-is Gigi home?

14:49.914 --> 14:51.082
No. Sorry.

14:51.149 --> 14:53.287
Oh, good. It's you
I want to talk to.

14:55.557 --> 14:58.063
I don't mean to rush you,
but I was just about to

14:58.130 --> 15:01.336
pick Summer up from preschool,
so what's going on?

15:01.403 --> 15:04.175
Well, I'm a bit worried
about Gigi going on tour.

15:04.275 --> 15:06.513
What are you worried about?

15:06.613 --> 15:08.150
I'm worried about you.

15:08.216 --> 15:10.054
With Gigi gone for so long,
I'm worried that it could

15:10.120 --> 15:12.926
push you and Luke
back into bed together.

15:12.993 --> 15:13.861
(chuckles weakly)

15:13.928 --> 15:16.066
Nicky, Luke and I are done.
You know that.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.068
Why take the chance?

15:17.168 --> 15:18.270
Gigi's already on the fence

15:18.370 --> 15:19.172
about accepting the tour.

15:19.272 --> 15:20.875
All it'll take is
a little push from you

15:20.942 --> 15:22.645
to convince her not to go.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.417
And you take her spot.

15:27.054 --> 15:30.394
Where did you learn
how to do that?

15:30.461 --> 15:33.233
How to threaten somebody without
actually threatening them.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.106
The master, Dottie Roman.

15:36.172 --> 15:37.776
But that wasn't a threat.

15:37.843 --> 15:39.813
This is.

15:39.947 --> 15:41.549
Convince Gigi
not to go on the tour,

15:41.616 --> 15:44.222
or I tell her
about you and Luke.

15:51.603 --> 15:53.240
(door opens and closes)

16:02.024 --> 16:05.064
-Hey, stranger.
-Hey yourself.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.335
(Jamie chuckles)

16:09.974 --> 16:11.476
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:11.576 --> 16:15.084
JAMIE:
Listen, I, um, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

16:15.184 --> 16:17.555
Capitol reached out to me
about a new gig.

16:17.588 --> 16:19.559
Okay.

16:19.625 --> 16:22.933
They want me to head up their
new country crossover label.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.268
In L. A.

16:24.335 --> 16:26.039
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm.

16:26.106 --> 16:28.643
In L. A.?

16:28.711 --> 16:30.147
Well, congratulations.

16:30.214 --> 16:31.984
Thank you.

16:32.051 --> 16:33.353
When do you leave?

16:33.453 --> 16:36.459
Well, that's the thing, I...

16:36.526 --> 16:37.963
I'm not quite sure
I want to take it.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.665
Yeah, why not?

16:39.767 --> 16:42.438
(chuckles)
I thought it was obvious.

16:46.079 --> 16:48.016
I'm flattered.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.587
Okay.

16:50.654 --> 16:51.957
Not the, um...

16:52.024 --> 16:53.527
Not the reaction
I was hoping for.

16:53.627 --> 16:57.268
Well, you can't give something
like that up for me.

16:57.368 --> 16:59.873
I mean, I might,
I might not even be here.

17:00.007 --> 17:01.376
What if my tour comes through?

17:01.443 --> 17:04.048
Look, I just thought
we had something special.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.453
I wanted to see
how you felt, that's all.

17:08.056 --> 17:09.392
I like you.

17:09.459 --> 17:14.001
But I can't be the reason
that you... that you stay.

17:14.068 --> 17:16.106
Especially when
all I can think about is

17:16.206 --> 17:18.911
that there might be a reason
for me to go.

17:19.011 --> 17:20.782
I'm sorry.

17:20.849 --> 17:23.921
You got to do what's best
for you, and, um...

17:26.426 --> 17:27.428
...for the first time
in my life,

17:27.528 --> 17:29.565
I've got to do
what's best for me.

17:41.356 --> 17:43.393
Oh, no, Ace, this is not
a good time.

17:43.460 --> 17:45.063
My mother told me
who you are.

17:45.130 --> 17:48.070
So you're here
to yell at me, too?

17:48.136 --> 17:50.274
No, I just...

17:50.340 --> 17:52.311
I just want to see
how Ana's taking it.

17:54.148 --> 17:55.384
-That well, huh?
-Yeah.

17:55.451 --> 17:57.254
I have never seen her so angry.

17:57.321 --> 17:58.758
She doesn't even want
to talk to me.

17:58.858 --> 18:00.929
I don't know, maybe
she'll talk to me.

18:02.799 --> 18:05.637
Would you make her understand
that the last thing I wanted

18:05.705 --> 18:06.774
was to hurt her?

18:08.110 --> 18:10.682
Okay, come in.

18:13.955 --> 18:16.359
Ana?

18:16.459 --> 18:18.931
Hey, someone's here to see you.

18:20.702 --> 18:22.371
Hon?

18:24.509 --> 18:26.513
Ay.

18:30.621 --> 18:31.857
She's gone.

18:38.671 --> 18:41.677
All right, brother,
whenever you're ready.

18:41.744 --> 18:43.213

if you can't say nothing nice,

20:55.243 --> 20:56.512
don't say nothing at all.

20:56.579 --> 20:59.987
Nice? Are you kidding?

21:00.087 --> 21:01.623
It's as if you were there
when that man

21:01.690 --> 21:02.759
took his dying breath.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.364
-You like it?
-Like it?

21:05.430 --> 21:07.401
Albie, it's a damn masterpiece.

21:08.203 --> 21:10.708
You want to tell me where
that inspiration came from?

21:10.775 --> 21:13.046
You know better than that.

21:13.146 --> 21:17.421
A man's got to keep
some secrets for himself.

21:22.264 --> 21:24.001
She turned off the tracking.

21:24.068 --> 21:25.504
Any idea where she's headed?

21:25.637 --> 21:27.842
I'm guessing back home,
where she grew up.

21:27.909 --> 21:29.780
-Albuquerque?
-Yeah. <i>Ay, dios mio.</i>

21:29.846 --> 21:32.017
So if I drive,
it'll take me, what,

21:32.084 --> 21:33.053
like ten hours to get there?

21:33.119 --> 21:34.555
No, Mrs. Phoenix, I don't think
it's a good idea

21:34.622 --> 21:35.557
if you go after her.

21:35.624 --> 21:36.694
Uh, what are you talking about?

21:36.727 --> 21:38.263
Why don't you let me go?

21:38.396 --> 21:41.369
No. Mm. I-- No.
It's a bad idea.

21:41.436 --> 21:42.739
Look, I know exactly
what you're thinking,

21:42.806 --> 21:44.575
but I made a promise
to my mom.

21:44.642 --> 21:48.116
Ana and I-- we're over.
We're just family now.

21:48.918 --> 21:50.955
And you expect me
to believe that?

21:51.055 --> 21:53.526
Mrs. Phoenix, I care
about your daughter.

21:53.626 --> 21:55.664
I just want to make sure
that she's safe,

21:55.798 --> 21:57.534
and I want to bring her
back home.

21:57.601 --> 22:00.207
That's all that matters
right now, right?

22:07.187 --> 22:09.960
Hey, Jamie.

22:10.060 --> 22:11.129
My dad around?

22:11.195 --> 22:12.966
You just missed him.

22:13.066 --> 22:15.938
And I am mixing down
the last track now.

22:16.005 --> 22:17.776
The album's done?

22:17.842 --> 22:19.278
Please, please tell me
that it's good.

22:19.378 --> 22:22.618
It's not good.
It's phenomenal.

22:23.453 --> 22:25.357
And this new track
that Albie wrote

22:25.457 --> 22:26.459
pulls the whole thing together.

22:26.559 --> 22:27.696
I mean, it's so damn good,

22:27.796 --> 22:29.532
it would make the Man in Black
green with envy.

22:29.598 --> 22:33.440
The man is a magician
with a six-string.

22:33.540 --> 22:37.047
And the lyrics, I'm telling you,
they're chilling.

22:37.114 --> 22:38.718
Yeah? How so?

22:38.851 --> 22:40.587
Well, I don't know where in
the depths of Albie Roman's soul

22:40.688 --> 22:41.622
they came from,

22:41.757 --> 22:42.892
but if I didn't know
any better,

22:42.992 --> 22:44.830
I'd say your daddy
was confessing

22:44.896 --> 22:47.134
to a murder in that song.

No, you look amazing.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.100
Are you okay?

23:20.200 --> 23:23.373
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just
thinking about your tour.

23:23.473 --> 23:24.475
The tour with the Roses.

23:24.542 --> 23:27.214
Well, I haven't made
my decision yet.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.285
Right. But I have.

23:29.385 --> 23:31.255
Okay.

23:32.291 --> 23:34.830
You were born a star.

23:35.932 --> 23:38.336
And not just any star,
but a megastar

23:38.436 --> 23:39.806
who can change the world.

23:39.906 --> 23:42.912
And it's not just
with your talent, Gigi,

23:42.979 --> 23:46.219
it's just, it's just who you
are, the way you touch people.

23:46.285 --> 23:49.893
You move them. I see it
every time you sing.

23:49.960 --> 23:54.068
And the rest of the world
needs to see that, too.

23:55.671 --> 23:58.844
So you are going to show them
on that tour.

23:58.944 --> 24:02.084
What about you and Summer
and the baby?

24:02.151 --> 24:04.923
Kinda got the whole baby thing
under control, right?

24:05.023 --> 24:05.725
(Gigi laughs)

24:05.825 --> 24:07.561
And Summer will be fine.

24:07.628 --> 24:11.636
You're not going to space.
It's just a tour.

24:11.737 --> 24:13.741
(Kayla chuckles)

24:13.841 --> 24:15.745
I love you so much.

24:15.845 --> 24:18.016

26:11.576 --> 26:14.515

-Yeah. It's unmistakable.

Thank y'all.
Thank you so much.

27:09.625 --> 27:13.366
Well, I just, I can't tell y'all
what an honor it is

27:13.433 --> 27:14.568
to be named on this list.

27:14.668 --> 27:18.076
In fact, I've had more than
my share of blessings lately.

27:18.176 --> 27:20.080
Like the opportunity
to go on tour,

27:20.180 --> 27:21.615
which would mean
I would get to do this

27:21.717 --> 27:23.619
every night for months.

27:23.721 --> 27:25.523
(cheers and applause)

27:25.590 --> 27:28.229
But I've also been blessed
with something that's

27:28.296 --> 27:30.935
far more meaningful to me,
and that-that's my family.

27:31.035 --> 27:33.039
Honey, looking out
at you two tonight

27:33.106 --> 27:35.845
and thinking about our baby
we have on the way,

27:35.945 --> 27:37.849
nothing could take me
away from you.

27:37.949 --> 27:41.088
And that's why, um,
earlier tonight

27:41.188 --> 27:44.661
-I turned down the Yellow Roses.
-(disappointed groans)

27:44.729 --> 27:48.336
And, uh, I thanked them
for the honor.

27:48.403 --> 27:49.973
And I told them that
certain things were just

27:50.040 --> 27:52.577
too precious to miss out on,
and that, um,

27:52.611 --> 27:54.916
y'all can bet your sweet ass
I'll tour someday, right?

27:55.016 --> 27:57.689
But that day is not today.

27:57.755 --> 27:59.793
(cheers and applause)

27:59.859 --> 28:00.861
Just thank you so much,
everybody.

28:00.928 --> 28:04.501
I really appreciate it.

28:04.568 --> 28:07.007
Thank you.

28:12.985 --> 28:15.557
Thought I'd find you here.

28:15.657 --> 28:18.663
Good work, Detective.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.400
Feel free to turn around
and go right back

28:20.467 --> 28:22.337
to where you came from.

28:22.437 --> 28:24.341
I was worried about you.

28:25.377 --> 28:27.581
You weren't answering
any of my texts.

28:27.682 --> 28:29.284
I had nothing to say.

28:33.459 --> 28:36.800
Not quite as nice as
where you come from, is it?

28:36.867 --> 28:37.835
I have no idea.

28:37.935 --> 28:39.839
I was adopted
from the Philippines

28:39.906 --> 28:41.642
when I was a baby.

28:41.710 --> 28:43.747
Then you know
what it feels like.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.485
-What?
-Not to belong.

28:46.552 --> 28:48.690
I may be a Roman by blood,

28:48.757 --> 28:52.230
but... this is who I am.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.903
A girl from ABQ living in

28:55.003 --> 28:56.673
a one-bedroom walk-up.

28:56.773 --> 28:58.811
I don't belong
with all of you.

28:58.877 --> 29:02.250
You know, I used to think
the same way.

29:03.821 --> 29:08.429
But the Romans...
they proved me wrong.

29:08.496 --> 29:10.734
And they taught me that

29:10.801 --> 29:14.041
family is whoever you love.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.651
Did you know about me

29:19.752 --> 29:22.624
-when we were...
-No.

29:22.692 --> 29:24.696
None of us did.

29:26.565 --> 29:27.902
It doesn't matter now.

29:28.035 --> 29:31.609
When the world finds out,
they'll think I made it

29:31.676 --> 29:33.045
because I'm a Roman.

29:34.816 --> 29:37.722
I'm so angry at my mother.

29:37.822 --> 29:40.460
She should have told you.

29:40.593 --> 29:44.803
You know, sometimes even
the people who love you

29:44.869 --> 29:46.372
can make mistakes.

29:48.677 --> 29:51.482
Listen, you must be starving.

29:51.549 --> 29:53.887
There's this place I passed
driving in.

29:53.921 --> 29:56.860
-You want to...?
-No. Thanks.

29:56.927 --> 29:59.598
-I'd like to be alone.
-All right.

29:59.631 --> 30:03.072
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

30:12.591 --> 30:14.094
(indistinct chatter)

30:14.194 --> 30:17.467
Hey. Just the woman
I wanted to see.

30:17.534 --> 30:19.739
-Oh, what is it now?
-I wanted to thank you

30:19.839 --> 30:21.810
for talking to Gigi.

30:21.877 --> 30:23.012
(chuckles)

30:23.112 --> 30:24.348
What's so funny?

30:24.448 --> 30:26.018
That you think
that's what I did.

30:26.085 --> 30:28.222
Gigi passed on that
all on her own.

30:28.322 --> 30:30.828
I would never tell your sister
to do something

30:30.895 --> 30:32.430
that wasn't good for her
or her career.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.568
That's a very ballsy move
for someone

30:34.635 --> 30:35.738
who has so much to lose.

30:35.838 --> 30:37.107
Look, I know I've made mistakes,

30:37.207 --> 30:40.213
but you will never manipulate me
into hurting Gigi,

30:40.280 --> 30:43.720
no matter how desperate you are
to be the next Dottie Roman.

30:43.820 --> 30:46.258
Be very careful, Kayla.

30:46.358 --> 30:47.728
Or what?

30:47.795 --> 30:51.101
You'll tell Gigi the truth
about what I've done?

30:51.168 --> 30:52.637
Let's see if you
have it in you

30:52.705 --> 30:54.007
to break your sister's heart.

30:54.074 --> 30:57.347
You want to be Dottie,
be Dottie.

30:57.447 --> 31:00.420
I dare you.

31:09.371 --> 31:12.210
Hey, uh, can I get
one cheeseburger deluxe

31:12.277 --> 31:13.780
and well-done fries, please?

31:13.881 --> 31:16.652
Wait, I-I know you, don't I?

31:16.686 --> 31:20.126
Wait, you're Dottie Roman's
grandson, right?

31:21.161 --> 31:23.165
It's Ace Roman.

31:23.266 --> 31:27.742
Hey, hey, everyone,
this is Ace Roman.

31:27.808 --> 31:29.177
Play a song for us, will you?

31:29.244 --> 31:32.450
-We got the band up there
and everything.
-Oh, yeah.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.087
No, I just, I just came here
to grab something to eat.

31:34.187 --> 31:35.256
-Oh, please.
-Come on.

31:35.356 --> 31:37.828
Please. It'd be amazing.

31:37.962 --> 31:39.097
Go on.

31:39.197 --> 31:40.935
Give the people
what they want.

31:41.001 --> 31:44.809
All right, under one condition.
Come on.

31:44.876 --> 31:46.345
No, Ace, I'm not in the mood.

31:46.445 --> 31:49.719
One song and I'll
leave you alone, I promise.

34:06.960 --> 34:08.730
You had no right
to listen to it.

34:08.797 --> 34:11.335
Daddy, why would you write about
Clive's death, especially now?

34:11.402 --> 34:14.909
First of all,
nobody's gonna tell me

34:14.976 --> 34:16.813
what I can and can't
write about.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.349
Especially you two.

34:18.416 --> 34:21.121
And second, it's just a song.

34:21.188 --> 34:23.092
It's about killing a man.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.998
And keeping a secret.
A family secret.

34:26.098 --> 34:27.267
It's a damn country song.

Ain't nobody gonna
think twice about it.

LUKE:
No, thanks, Willa.

34:37.420 --> 34:40.861

like a million more

34:40.961 --> 34:41.896
that have come before it.

34:41.963 --> 34:46.238
And I'm telling you both

35:09.251 --> 35:12.023
Oh, hi, Geeg.
You're up early.

35:12.123 --> 35:13.192
It's 'cause I couldn't sleep.

35:13.259 --> 35:16.465
I had a dream my sister tried
to stab me in the back.

35:16.532 --> 35:20.874
Until I realized it wasn't
a dream at all.

35:20.941 --> 35:22.210
You got some nerve.

35:22.277 --> 35:24.214
-What...
-Cut the crap.

35:24.281 --> 35:26.084
I know you tried to get
my wife to convince me

35:26.151 --> 35:29.992
-to pass on the Yellow Roses.
-Did Kayla tell you that?

35:30.059 --> 35:31.395
Of course she did.

35:31.461 --> 35:32.698
We have no secrets
from each other.

35:32.765 --> 35:34.100
Well, you said you didn't
want to go.

35:34.167 --> 35:35.671
-Well, that's beside the point.
-No, it is the point.

35:35.737 --> 35:37.540
You turned it down
all by yourself because

35:37.574 --> 35:42.016
you have no idea that success
comes with sacrifice.

35:42.150 --> 35:43.452
You don't just get anointed
the queen.

35:43.486 --> 35:44.521
Is that the problem?

35:44.588 --> 35:46.291
That things come to me too easy,

35:46.358 --> 35:48.362
or just that they don't
come to you at all?

35:48.429 --> 35:50.032
Look, I know you
wanna be Mama,

35:50.099 --> 35:51.468
and Mama played dirty.

35:51.568 --> 35:53.405
But the difference between
her and you is,

35:53.472 --> 35:55.476
she'd never do anything
to tear us apart.

35:55.576 --> 35:57.748
She'd be ashamed of you.

35:57.848 --> 36:00.520
I hope you're ashamed
of yourself.

All right.

36:18.556 --> 36:22.130
The D. A.'s office found blood
in Clive's car.

36:22.230 --> 36:24.267
It's your blood, babe.

36:24.334 --> 36:25.303
Oh, my God.

36:25.403 --> 36:27.340
I thought I could stop Tripp
from investigating,

36:27.407 --> 36:29.578
but I'm not so sure now.

36:29.644 --> 36:31.281
-Why would you think
you could do that?
-Well,

36:31.348 --> 36:33.018
because he owes me.

36:33.085 --> 36:36.893
Before you were born,
you know I went to prison.

36:36.993 --> 36:40.032
-Yes.
-Driving drunk...

36:40.099 --> 36:42.103
killing a man.

36:42.905 --> 36:45.811
Yes, and it was an accident.
You did your time.

36:48.482 --> 36:50.921
Except I wasn't driving
the car that night.

36:50.988 --> 36:53.392
I didn't kill that man.

36:53.459 --> 36:55.663
Tripp Dewitt did.

36:55.764 --> 36:58.870
But you took the blame?
Why would you do that?

36:58.970 --> 37:00.606
(sighs)

37:00.674 --> 37:02.110
Well...

37:05.082 --> 37:06.686
...'cause Tripp had a future,

37:06.786 --> 37:10.694
and I was just a knockaround kid
from North Austin going nowhere.

37:10.761 --> 37:15.336
I couldn't jump over a nickel
to save a dime.

37:15.403 --> 37:17.407
You spent three years in a cell

37:17.507 --> 37:19.411
for something
that you didn't do?

37:19.511 --> 37:22.650
I took the fall for somebody
that I cared about.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.924
But this time it's not just
a friend that's in danger,

37:26.024 --> 37:27.060
it's our family.

37:28.062 --> 37:29.297
Your song is a confession.

37:29.397 --> 37:31.703
Just know I'll do anything

37:31.769 --> 37:34.942
to protect you and this family,

37:34.976 --> 37:36.980
no matter what it takes.

37:41.154 --> 37:42.457
<i>ACE:</i>
<i>Do you believe me now?</i>

37:42.523 --> 37:45.396
Nobody knew you were
a Roman back there,

37:45.496 --> 37:47.333
and nobody cared.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.604
They just couldn't
get enough of you.

37:49.705 --> 37:51.676
You telling me
you could walk away from

37:51.743 --> 37:52.911
what's gonna be
an amazing career

37:53.012 --> 37:57.120
just because you were
born a Roman?

37:57.220 --> 37:58.589
(both laugh)

37:58.723 --> 38:01.461
When you say it like that,
it sounds pretty stupid.

38:03.532 --> 38:07.675
So... what about us?

38:09.377 --> 38:11.581
What happens now?

38:11.648 --> 38:14.220
Well, we don't stop caring
about each other,

38:14.287 --> 38:18.128
but... we got to let that go.

38:19.899 --> 38:21.601
Why? Because you think
it's wrong?

38:21.668 --> 38:24.240
It's just that I made
a promise to my mom

38:24.341 --> 38:25.142
and to yours.

38:25.343 --> 38:27.246
And that's more important
than how we feel?

38:27.313 --> 38:29.919
-That's not what I'm saying,
Ana.
-Then what are you saying?

38:29.986 --> 38:31.488
That I hauled my worried ass
across state lines

38:31.588 --> 38:35.396
to find you, to bring you back
to where you belong.

38:35.463 --> 38:37.100
Which happens to be
where I belong, too.

38:37.166 --> 38:40.172
Everything else...

38:40.272 --> 38:42.878
we'll figure it out.

38:57.875 --> 38:59.544
Nicky.

38:59.644 --> 39:01.181
I need to see my sister.

39:02.751 --> 39:04.755
I need to tell her something
that's long overdue.

39:06.425 --> 39:09.097
Nicky, please don't do this.

39:09.197 --> 39:10.734
Nicky, please.

39:13.005 --> 39:16.111
Geeg, there's something
I need to say to you.

39:16.211 --> 39:19.384
-I don't want to hear it, Nicky.
-Well, you're gonna.

39:19.451 --> 39:21.889
You're gonna listen.

39:23.158 --> 39:25.731
I'm sorry, okay?

39:25.831 --> 39:27.801
You were right, I put
my career before yours,

39:27.868 --> 39:29.504
and I shouldn't have done that.

39:29.604 --> 39:31.007
I just want it so badly,

39:31.074 --> 39:33.312
and I'm scared
that I'm never gonna get it.

39:34.114 --> 39:38.155
Oh, Nicky, you got it
all wrong, you know.

39:38.255 --> 39:40.092
Mama tried to make you feel
like your worth was

39:40.226 --> 39:42.163
all wrapped up in whether
you became a star or not,

39:42.263 --> 39:43.465
and that's just not true.

39:43.532 --> 39:44.735
And what if she was right, huh?

39:44.835 --> 39:46.806
-She's not right.
-I've got nothing left.

39:46.873 --> 39:50.981
My husband's gone,
my, my kids are getting older.

39:51.047 --> 39:53.720
I don't know who I am
if I don't become that star.

39:55.824 --> 39:58.495
You could take that spot
with the Yellow Roses.

39:58.595 --> 39:59.865
Maybe I could call 'em.

39:59.932 --> 40:03.238
Luke tried that.
It's already taken.

40:03.305 --> 40:06.044

Carrie Underwood.

40:07.046 --> 40:08.950

40:09.050 --> 40:11.088

40:11.856 --> 40:14.394
Everything you want,
you're gonna get it.

I'm not Mama.

40:21.676 --> 40:22.543
I never will be.

40:22.643 --> 40:27.386
She was ruthless
and single-minded, and...

40:27.487 --> 40:29.591
people still loved her.

40:29.624 --> 40:32.163
Mama was one of a kind.
