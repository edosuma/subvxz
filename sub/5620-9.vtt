WEBVTT

00:01.166 --> 00:02.792
Bruce?
Oh, hey. Good news.

00:02.875 --> 00:04.583
A certain dead possum
will no longer

00:04.667 --> 00:06.792
be terrorizing your house
with its stench.

00:06.875 --> 00:08.250
You got it out?
Yes.

00:08.333 --> 00:10.834
Oh, my hero.
Mm.
(chuckles)

00:12.583 --> 00:16.208
Hey, what'd you think of that,
uh, sexy photo I texted you?

00:16.291 --> 00:19.208
I think my "wowzers" text
spoke for itself.

00:19.291 --> 00:21.375
Well, uh, (clears throat)
would you ever consider...

00:21.458 --> 00:22.709
sending one back?

00:22.792 --> 00:24.542
Uh, yeah.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.542
You're gonna
get one, baby.
Oh.

00:26.625 --> 00:31.709
And then you and some guy at the
NSA are going to be quite happy.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.375
Okay.
(chuckles)

00:33.458 --> 00:34.792
JIMMY:
Hey, I parked on the street.

00:34.875 --> 00:36.583
What's the gang situation
in Pasadena? Whoa.

00:37.709 --> 00:40.792
Hoo, hoo, hoo,
hoo, hoo. Sorry.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.083
No. Not at all. No, I've
actually been holding in

00:43.166 --> 00:45.041
a number one for as long
as this racehorse can.

00:45.125 --> 00:47.000
(laughs):
So giddyup!

00:47.959 --> 00:49.792
To the bathroom.

00:51.750 --> 00:52.750
(door closes)

00:52.834 --> 00:54.291
He seems great.

00:54.333 --> 00:55.333
He<i> is </i>great.

00:55.417 --> 00:58.083
Harmless, pale,

00:58.166 --> 01:00.333
apparently has
a weak stream.
What?

01:00.417 --> 01:02.125
I'm here. I hear nothing.

01:02.208 --> 01:05.125
He hasn't started yet.
Jimmy, why are you here?

01:05.208 --> 01:07.500
I'm employing our son. A job
opened up at the restaurant.

01:07.583 --> 01:09.917
It was a happy accident.
Well, not really happy.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.834
Javier took a champagne
cork to the eye.

01:11.917 --> 01:14.208
At close range.
It was a total bloodbath.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.291
Okay. I'm-I'm in the middle
of something here right now.

01:16.375 --> 01:17.917
The point is, it
hit me like a...

01:18.000 --> 01:20.667
well, like, a champagne cork
that if I employ Gerald,

01:20.750 --> 01:22.375
he'll have some dough
and he'll finally be able

01:22.458 --> 01:23.875
to step outside
of that guesthouse.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.417
He's hardly ever
in the guesthouse.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.125
All right, well, I need
to talk to him. Where is he?

01:27.166 --> 01:29.041
Uh, he could be anywhere.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.250
Where?

01:31.333 --> 01:33.375
Hmm.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.291
What's the best boarding
method to load passengers

01:35.375 --> 01:36.834
on the plane fastest, Edie?

01:36.875 --> 01:38.750
Is it, uh, back to front?

01:38.792 --> 01:40.667
Window seats first? Zones?

01:40.709 --> 01:42.583
Zones.

01:42.625 --> 01:44.500
You're funny
when you try to be, Edie.

01:44.542 --> 01:45.625
Hey, kids.

01:45.709 --> 01:47.166
Son, big day for you.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.333
Stand up.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.375
(grunts)

01:49.458 --> 01:50.792
Oh, God. Sit back down.

01:50.875 --> 01:52.166
Your-your thing's
coming out of the thing.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.625
Oh, sorry.

01:53.709 --> 01:55.041
A job opened up
at the restaurant.

01:55.125 --> 01:57.000
That's great.

01:57.041 --> 01:58.625
No, thanks.

01:58.709 --> 01:59.917
What, you got something better
going on?

01:59.959 --> 02:01.750
Oh, yeah.
Uh, today I've been working

02:01.834 --> 02:03.583
on an airplane boarding
simulator to figure out

02:03.667 --> 02:05.667
the fastest way to load in
passengers. It's for Boeing.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.542
More like "boring."
Right, Edie?

02:08.625 --> 02:09.458
(laughs)

02:09.542 --> 02:11.500
Go play, Mama. Go play.

02:11.583 --> 02:14.166
Well, that's-that's good news.
When did Boeing hire you?

02:14.250 --> 02:16.166
Oh, they didn't. Yeah,
it's an Internet contest.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.208
Winner gets a trophy.
Well, not a real trophy.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.875
A icon of a trophy that
goes right by your username.

02:20.959 --> 02:22.542
But it dances.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.917
about your lifestyle
the whole time I've known you.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.458
You've only known
me two months.

02:26.542 --> 02:27.667
Also, you've complained
the whole time.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.250
Don't you want a real job?

02:30.333 --> 02:32.458
(chuckles) Your definition
of a real job is outdated.

02:32.542 --> 02:33.917
I mean, what's a real job?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.834
For starters, a-a job
that requires you to wear pants

02:35.917 --> 02:37.333
where your doo-dah
isn't falling out.

02:37.417 --> 02:39.166
I like having my
days free for Edie.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.166
And, you know, I got a couple
apps that might take off.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.458
And in the meantime, I make
enough money selling my DNA

02:43.542 --> 02:44.917
to really loving
lesbian couples.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.834
You think
you have enough money

02:46.917 --> 02:48.166
'cause you live
in your mom's guesthouse.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.750
Don't you want to live
in the real world?

02:49.834 --> 02:51.750
Come on, son, come to work
with me and-and see

02:51.834 --> 02:54.333
what it's like
to make an honest $9.75.

02:54.417 --> 02:55.625
$10.50.

02:55.709 --> 02:56.583
$11.

02:56.667 --> 02:57.625
Name your price.
$16.

02:57.709 --> 02:59.500
$16. Fine. (groans)

02:59.583 --> 03:01.583
That was fun though.
Is that what people do
in the real job world?

03:01.667 --> 03:02.959
Just think about it, will you?

03:03.041 --> 03:04.667
And for God's sake,
sit back down.

03:04.709 --> 03:06.041
Oh.

03:06.125 --> 03:08.041
(creaking in distance)

03:12.208 --> 03:14.583
(creaking continues)

03:16.667 --> 03:19.458
BRUCE: Hey, where are the
condoms? I'm not seeing them.

03:19.542 --> 03:22.333
SARA: Second drawer!
Behind the allergy medicine.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.625
BRUCE: Found 'em!
Ooh! New brand!

03:24.709 --> 03:26.542
This'll be fun!

03:26.625 --> 03:28.875
Yep, I got to move out of here.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.750
♪ ♪

03:31.834 --> 03:33.875
All right, team, our parking
lot recently got split

03:33.959 --> 03:35.792
with Bistro 6. How's that
working out, Annelise?

03:35.875 --> 03:38.125
It's bad. Valet service
is taking forever.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.333
Last night, a couple broke up
and got back together

03:40.417 --> 03:41.542
before their car pulled up.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.333
You need to do something.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.458
I'll put my best man on it.
Annelise, take care of it.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.291
All right, so,
on a brighter note,

03:47.375 --> 03:49.333
we have a new host.
Chip, come on up here.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.041
(whooping)

03:51.083 --> 03:52.125
He's part of
the family now,

03:52.208 --> 03:53.834
so let's treat
him right, huh?

03:53.917 --> 03:55.750
Hey. Uh, sorry
to interrupt.

03:55.834 --> 03:57.834
I was just wondering, is
that job still available?

03:57.917 --> 04:00.667
Yes. Chip, we gave it a try.
It just wasn't a good fit.

04:00.709 --> 04:02.041
Everybody, Chip.

04:02.959 --> 04:03.834
Hey, what made you
change your mind?

04:03.917 --> 04:05.125
Oh, you did, you know?

04:05.208 --> 04:06.166
You made a lot
of good points.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.834
And then Mom and
Bruce sort of...

04:07.917 --> 04:09.417
hammered it home.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.709
I love this! You're following
in my footsteps.
Yeah.

04:11.792 --> 04:13.583
I always wanted to call
the place Jimmy &amp; Son,

04:13.667 --> 04:15.375
but I just never wanted a son.
All right, come on.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.458
Let's talk about what
it means to be a host.

04:17.542 --> 04:19.458
Well, yeah, I'm not really sure
if hosting is my thing.

04:19.542 --> 04:22.250
But I made a little mind map
of all my talents and passions.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.667
Thought we could look at it

04:23.750 --> 04:24.834
and really see
where I could soar.

04:24.875 --> 04:26.750
"Gerald Kingsley."
Visual diagram

04:26.792 --> 04:28.917
that relates to your skills
and your experiences.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.542
Son, hosting is
in your blood.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.000
I mean, I made it as a
front-of-the-house guy,

04:32.083 --> 04:33.458
and so could you;
you're half of me.

04:33.542 --> 04:35.291
At the end of the day,
it's just about schmoozing.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.834
Watch. Hey, Shelby,

04:36.917 --> 04:38.375
you look beautiful
tonight.
(chuckles)

04:38.417 --> 04:42.333
Hey, uh, Black Tie,
I like how bald you are.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.083
We'll get there.

04:45.125 --> 04:46.709
(rap music playing loudly)

04:46.792 --> 04:49.959
(laughter, whooping)

04:52.709 --> 04:54.583
What is this?

04:54.667 --> 04:56.333
Oh. Well, you've never seen
the Pre-Shift Shuffle?

04:56.417 --> 04:57.417
It's how I rally
the troops.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.375
I do a little
dance, some comedy.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.208
Lately, I've been flavoring
it with a little bit

05:01.291 --> 05:02.583
of light magic.
Oh, excuse me,

05:02.667 --> 05:05.333
I got a little...
quarter...

05:05.417 --> 05:07.250
Wait, where the
hell did it go?

05:07.333 --> 05:09.125
(music stops)

05:10.166 --> 05:11.917
Have some dignity, man.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.750
This is how I roll, okay? You
might think I'm a degenerate...

05:13.834 --> 05:15.667
I'm not saying
you're a degenerate.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.583
No, I'm sorry, can
you let me finish?

05:17.667 --> 05:19.125
You might think
I'm a degenerate,

05:19.208 --> 05:21.667
but I'm more like
Ellen DeGeneres.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.959
That was not worth it.
Yeah.

05:24.041 --> 05:25.166
You're the head chef, Ravi.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.083
Your own staff
thinks you're a fool.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.375
Get it together.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.959
(phone chimes)

05:40.625 --> 05:42.333
VANESSA:
Why are you eating

05:42.417 --> 05:43.417
your sandwich so weird?

05:43.500 --> 05:45.750
Uh... weird?

05:45.834 --> 05:48.375
Or erotic and mysterious?

05:48.458 --> 05:50.125
Oh, honey, no.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.000
You're trying to take
a sexy photo for your man?

05:52.083 --> 05:54.166
Yes. He asked for one,
and I want to do it.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.875
He never asks me for anything.

05:55.959 --> 05:57.792
But I-I am clueless.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.500
The sexiest picture I have
is a caricature

05:59.542 --> 06:01.000
of me from the Venice Boardwalk.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.166
And I'm eating a tuna sandwich
in that, too.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.750
Okay. Um, Don't worry.

06:04.834 --> 06:06.542
Mama's here. Let me
see what you got.

06:06.625 --> 06:08.458
(sighs) This is what my life
has come to,

06:08.542 --> 06:10.375
showing my breasts
to my granddaughter's mother

06:10.458 --> 06:12.041
to impress my boyfriend.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.291
I meant let me
see the photo.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.583
Right, right, right.

06:15.959 --> 06:16.792
Huh?

06:16.875 --> 06:18.834
I'll put on
a pot of coffee.

06:18.875 --> 06:20.542
What?

06:20.625 --> 06:23.125
Aw! That bad?

06:23.208 --> 06:24.375
I'd like to personally
thank you all

06:24.458 --> 06:25.625
for coming
to this meeting today.

06:25.709 --> 06:27.583
We had to.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.500
It's a very special day
here at the restaurant.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.542
Are we getting health insurance?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.166
Today is Gerald's
first day as host.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.417
Who is Gerald?

06:34.500 --> 06:37.583
I even sent Gerald
to my personal tailor, Enzo,

06:37.667 --> 06:39.375
for his own bespoke suit.

06:43.834 --> 06:45.792
What is that? That...
Enzo didn't make that suit.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.250
Yeah. I went to
Bob's Suit Outlet instead.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.875
Similar quality at a price that
makes Enzo look like a crook.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.375
You'll never guess
how cheap it was.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.208
No, I-I think I would.

06:53.291 --> 06:54.333
$37.50.

06:54.417 --> 06:55.458
You're a good guesser.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.417
(laughter)

07:00.500 --> 07:02.250
You sure you want to give
the most visible

07:02.333 --> 07:03.750
front-of-house job
to Gerald?

07:03.834 --> 07:05.500
Yes. He's following in
his father's footsteps.

07:07.291 --> 07:08.875
He'll be fine.
He'll learn.

07:08.959 --> 07:11.041
Best way to learn is
to throw him into the deep end.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.417
Remember your first day
on the job?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.500
You showed up
wearing that red...

07:13.583 --> 07:15.000
I don't even know what it was.

07:15.041 --> 07:17.125
It was a pantsuit, and
I'm wearing it right now.

07:17.208 --> 07:18.792
Ahead of its time
is what it was.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.417
And how are we this evening?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.250
Hosting is
in his DNA. Watch.

07:22.333 --> 07:23.250
Wonderful. How are you?

07:23.333 --> 07:25.166
Marvelous, thank you.

07:26.125 --> 07:26.959
`Actually,

07:27.041 --> 07:28.834
I'm a little bummed, I guess.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.667
Oh? What-what happened?

07:30.750 --> 07:32.250
Nothing. Nothing, really.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.709
It's actually
a really good day.

07:33.792 --> 07:36.083
Just sometimes, I get
a little blue, no reason at all.

07:36.166 --> 07:38.750
(chuckles)
It'll pass. Or not.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.166
What do you recommend between
the lamb chops and foie gras?

07:41.250 --> 07:43.250
Ooh. Well, I mean,
one's a murdered baby.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.125
The other one's
a tortured adult, but...

07:45.208 --> 07:46.792
I'm sure they're both delicious.
(laughs)

07:49.792 --> 07:51.375
This is coming
from a place of love.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.750
That bra is a disaster. Lose it.

07:53.834 --> 07:56.959
This is a Sassy and Sensible.
No, I'm not taking my bra off.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.834
Would it help
if I take mine off?

07:58.917 --> 08:00.709
For the third time,
no, it will not help.

08:00.792 --> 08:02.417
CJ, can you check on
that broccoli soufflé?

08:02.500 --> 08:04.291
I can. For Jerry Seinfeld.

08:04.375 --> 08:05.834
Yeah, man, do it!

08:05.917 --> 08:07.542
(imitating Seinfeld):
What's the deal with soufflé?

08:07.625 --> 08:08.792
(laughter)

08:08.875 --> 08:10.709
Why do we have to order
it a day in advance?

08:10.792 --> 08:12.750
Does it<i> have </i>other plans?

08:12.834 --> 08:14.583
It's not accurate,
but it is so funny.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.291
(laughter)

08:19.875 --> 08:21.583
Okay. All right, guys,
all right. We've had our fun.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.125
Seriously, can you check
on that soufflé?

08:23.208 --> 08:25.875
Is that Chef Ravi talking?
Or is it Seth Rogen?

08:25.959 --> 08:27.417
Enough, okay?
All right, back to work.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.458
STAFF (chanting):
Seth. Seth. Seth. Seth. Seth.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.375
Guys, enough. All right, okay.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.458
All right, let's...

08:33.542 --> 08:35.333
Hey, cut the crap!
All right?!

08:35.417 --> 08:37.750
This isn't a comedy club.
This is a restaurant.

08:37.792 --> 08:39.291
I'm not a puppet, I'm your boss.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.125
You guys are here to cook,

08:41.208 --> 08:43.000
and most of you aren't even
halfway good at it.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.083
So maybe

08:44.166 --> 08:45.500
if you focus on your cooking,

08:45.583 --> 08:47.792
you will get
halfway decent at it.

08:47.834 --> 08:49.959
Oh, my God, are we making Ravi
do Gordon Ramsay?

08:50.041 --> 08:51.125
That's hilar...

08:51.208 --> 08:53.792
No? Okay, no.

08:53.875 --> 08:55.375
Suck in your neck.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.417
Slight duck face.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.083
Lift your arm
like you're waving.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.166
Don't wave.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.041
Arch your back.
Tighten your nose.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.291

09:05.625 --> 09:06.792
(clicks tongue)

09:09.959 --> 09:11.375
This isn't gonna work.
You got to lose the bra.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.417
(scoffs)

09:13.500 --> 09:15.500
you are an intelligent,
strong woman.

09:15.583 --> 09:16.792
You put yourself
through night school

09:16.875 --> 09:18.667
so you can become a
successful professional.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.834
You have earned the right
to feel sexy in this body.

09:20.917 --> 09:21.959
Now,

09:22.041 --> 09:22.875
flip the clasp

09:22.959 --> 09:24.458
and show me those knockers.

09:24.542 --> 09:26.834
Ugh, screw it.

09:30.583 --> 09:31.792
(camera clicks)

09:31.875 --> 09:33.166
Damn, you are fine!

09:33.250 --> 09:34.625
Okay, send this.

09:34.709 --> 09:36.959
I can't look.
Okay, I sent it. I sent it.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.834
Yeah, you probably
should've looked.

09:38.917 --> 09:40.125
You just sent that to Jimmy.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.083
What? No!

09:43.709 --> 09:46.291
I don't get it. The apple didn't
just fall far from the tree.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.166
It fell far, rolled down
a hill, onto a freeway,

09:48.250 --> 09:50.875
and got hit by a truck
full of nerds.

09:50.959 --> 09:52.750
Is he cutting
that person's steak?

09:52.834 --> 09:54.166
I got it.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.166
Stop it.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.208
I think I have a solution

09:56.291 --> 09:57.333
to the parking situation.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.208
We flip this whole
thing on its head.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.458
They don't drive here, we wrap
up the food in containers,

10:01.542 --> 10:03.750
then we drive it to them...
Okay, I hear it now.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.083
That's just delivery.

10:05.166 --> 10:06.125
(phone vibrates)

10:07.083 --> 10:08.333
Holy crap.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.917
Holy crap.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.208
Why would she send me this?

10:11.291 --> 10:12.834
Why would she cover
those things up?

10:12.917 --> 10:14.041
Hi, customer service.

10:14.125 --> 10:15.750
I need to cancel a text message.

10:15.834 --> 10:17.458
Uh, yeah, I already sent it.

No,

That's perfect.

10:56.417 --> 10:57.792

Yeah.

the dice, right?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.000
You have to.
You do.

Excuse me one second, please.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.208
Be right back.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.083
There are people that are
waiting to be seated.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.458

I mean, she just broke up

11:10.542 --> 11:11.542
with her boyfriend
of three years.

11:11.625 --> 11:12.875
That's none of
your business.

that convinced her to do it.

Or buy a food truck.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.917
No matter what,
keep your eyes peeled

15:45.000 --> 15:47.750
on social media, 'cause
it is gonna be a wild ride.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.166
(whoops)

15:49.250 --> 15:50.750
What did you do?

15:50.834 --> 15:52.458
I'm sorry that happened to you.

15:52.542 --> 15:54.625
Can I get you a drink
on the house?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.583
Ravi's not even answering
the phone. It looks like

15:59.667 --> 16:01.417
he started a blog--
<i>A Chef's Journey.</i>

16:01.500 --> 16:03.125
(piano melody playing)

16:03.208 --> 16:05.000
You see what you've done?

16:05.041 --> 16:06.291
all deserve to be
happy in our jobs.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.333
I mean, who can
argue with that?

16:07.417 --> 16:09.750
Me. I can.
Why does everybody think

16:09.792 --> 16:11.917
every job has to be
incredibly amazing?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.417
You know, when I was your age,
I was, I was lugging ice

16:14.458 --> 16:15.750
as a bar-back.
You think I was happy? I wasn't.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.542
You have to earn
happiness, Gerald.

16:17.583 --> 16:19.458
All right, but I'm not gonna
compromise and be miserable now

16:19.542 --> 16:21.792
just so I can, like, maybe
afford a boat when I'm 50.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.709
Fine. You know what, sit around,
work on your projects

16:23.750 --> 16:25.542
and your apps and all.
I'll buy you some pajamas,

16:25.625 --> 16:26.709
'cause I'm assuming
you can't afford your own.

16:26.792 --> 16:28.250
Y-You think
I'm such a loser

16:28.333 --> 16:29.542
just 'cause I'm not
exactly like you.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.583
Okay, if you want
someone who worships you

16:31.667 --> 16:33.667
that you can dress up,
get a dog.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.041
(music stops)

16:36.125 --> 16:37.959
Hey, how'd you get that to...

16:38.041 --> 16:39.500
(music resumes)

16:39.583 --> 16:41.917
So I just decided
I don't need to live the life

16:42.000 --> 16:43.875
that he dictates
for me, right?

16:43.959 --> 16:45.792
Yeah.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.417
I know. Yeah, you get me.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.959
You know, it's like,
why does he always

16:49.041 --> 16:51.500
have to try to mold me
into who he is, you know?

16:51.583 --> 16:53.250
I'm a cool guy,
I have cool interests.

16:53.333 --> 16:56.041
Like, you know,
binary code and space shuttles

16:56.125 --> 16:58.625
and my first recycling plant.

17:01.792 --> 17:05.125
All the things
I'm trying to force on you.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.500
How the tables
have turned, Edie.

17:07.583 --> 17:10.375
Thank you, Edie.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.542
This was a very helpful
conversation.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.041
Horses pee-pee.

17:14.125 --> 17:17.041
Yes, sometimes a horse
does go pee-pee.

17:17.625 --> 17:19.500
(line ringing)

17:19.542 --> 17:20.792
(phone ringing)

17:20.875 --> 17:23.041
Ravi? You're still here?

17:23.125 --> 17:24.417
I've been waiting forever
for my car.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.542
It's impossible
to storm out of this place.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.166
You should know that there's
a text chain going around.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.750
Everyone wants to take you
out for surprise drinks.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.792
Well, then why did you tell me?
You know I love surprises.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.792
Sad thing is, I wasn't
on the text chain.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.250
I saw it on
someone's phone.

17:37.333 --> 17:38.542
Your crew loves you.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.834
Maybe you do
get respect.

17:40.917 --> 17:43.625
The kind people
give to... a clown.

17:43.709 --> 17:46.208
Or a guy that can fit a lot
of marshmallows in his mouth.

17:46.291 --> 17:47.875
That means a lot to me.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.625
Will you come back?

17:49.709 --> 17:51.000
I could.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.625
For Jerry Seinfeld.

17:52.709 --> 17:54.583
(sighs)

17:54.667 --> 17:56.542
(imitating Seinfeld):
What's the deal with Ravi?

17:56.625 --> 17:58.500
Is he a great chef?

17:58.542 --> 17:59.542
Yeah. Yeah,
you're pretty terrible at that.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.041
All the more reason
why I should stay.

18:01.125 --> 18:02.375
All right, let's get back
in my kitchen, huh?

18:02.458 --> 18:05.333
I wouldn't say "terrible."

18:05.417 --> 18:06.458
(car horns honking)

18:06.542 --> 18:08.000
JIMMY:
No, not that one!

18:08.083 --> 18:10.375
M-Move that one
and then get mine in this way.

18:10.458 --> 18:13.083
Kenny, look, I need my car.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.125
Gerald.

18:14.166 --> 18:15.250
Listen, I'm sorry...

18:15.333 --> 18:18.208
You love me.

18:18.291 --> 18:20.041
You think what's best
for you is best for me,

18:20.125 --> 18:21.875
and I do the same
thing with Edie.

18:21.959 --> 18:23.917
You know, forcing our kids to
be as ridiculous as we are--

18:24.000 --> 18:25.792
it's how we show love.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.834
You love me.
(chuckles)

18:29.917 --> 18:31.458
ALL:
Aw.

18:31.542 --> 18:34.542
You're all still waiting
for your cars? What a mess.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.500
Kenny, did Annelise
talk to you about this?

18:36.542 --> 18:39.417
Hey, maybe I can help.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.333
No, Dad,
your lot's not too small.

18:41.417 --> 18:42.750
It's just disorganized.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.667
It's like my airplane
boarding simulator.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.000
Uh, Kenny, divorce
your entry-exit points,

18:46.083 --> 18:47.458
try a cross-access lane concept.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.458
Park the cars
on an angle.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.166
You can do it,
Kenny!

18:53.250 --> 18:56.834
Hey, I feel weird for
making such a big deal

18:56.917 --> 18:58.542
about that
naughty picture.

18:58.625 --> 18:59.750
Just forget about it.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.959
Oh. (scoffs)

19:01.041 --> 19:02.333
I hadn't even
thought about that.

19:02.417 --> 19:04.417
Oh, okay, yeah, well,
just forget about it.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.917
'Cause I don't need
a picture. I got you.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.834
Sexiest grandma
in the world.

19:08.917 --> 19:10.875
(chuckles)

19:14.083 --> 19:16.041
(phone chimes)

19:18.166 --> 19:20.000
Oh.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.375
No, I-I did
need the picture.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.500
Yeah, no, I
needed that.

19:22.583 --> 19:23.458
(both laugh)

19:23.542 --> 19:26.667
You're good.
Good, guys.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.208
Now remember,
when in doubt,

19:28.291 --> 19:30.959
always get the car closest
to the center. Got it?

19:31.041 --> 19:32.250
Check out my
nerdy kid.

19:32.291 --> 19:34.291
Yeah, he was standing
on my car earlier.

19:34.375 --> 19:35.834
Hey.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.917
I could use a mind
like yours around here.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.083
How would you like the job
of valet consultant?

19:40.166 --> 19:42.041
(sighs) Deal.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.500
May not be enough money
for you to move out right away.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.208
It's all right.
I'll get there.

19:46.291 --> 19:47.875
Oh, uh, that reminds me.

19:47.959 --> 19:49.709
Can I get an advance
on my first paycheck?

19:49.792 --> 19:51.417
There's something
I got to buy.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.583
BRUCE: Would you believe we're
already on our last condom?!

19:53.667 --> 19:55.166
SARA:
Look at us go!

19:55.250 --> 19:57.125
(muffled): Couple of
bunny rabbits over here!

19:57.208 --> 20:00.291
(Sara and Bruce laugh)

20:00.375 --> 20:03.250
Noise-canceling.
