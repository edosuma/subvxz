Well, both.

And they're not actually
breaking any law that we know of.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.422
We're going to shut them down
within the year.

10:32.506 --> 10:37.344
They are a sewer of dirty
and irresponsible commercialism

Full news again in one hour with me,
John Mayford. Till then, this man.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.158
This was the deal.

11:00.242 --> 11:03.536
l asked all of you to demand of me
to do a very foolish thing,

11:04.914 --> 11:07.457
and you sent in ideas in their millions.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.126
But one idea has defeated them all,

11:10.336 --> 11:14.422
so l'm proud to announce l will soon be
the first person to say the "F" word

11:14.507 --> 11:18.510
on rock 'n' roII radio
in the United Kingdom of Great Britain.

11:19.261 --> 11:22.847
But my aim is not to offend, it is to entertain.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.392
But also, perhaps, to educate a little.

11:25.476 --> 11:29.187
Because if you shoot a buIIet, someone dies.
When you drop a bomb, many die.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.231
lf you hit a woman, love dies.

11:31.315 --> 11:35.151
But if you say the "F" word,
nothing actually happens.

11:35.653 --> 11:39.781
So here it comes.
Especially for you, the "F" word.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.866

but here's the simple situation.

The authorities already dislike us.
lf you do this they will hate us,

11:56.674 --> 11:58.883
and by hook or by crook,
they'll find a way to close us down.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.594
They can't close us down. We're pirates.
That's why we're sitting out here

12:01.679 --> 12:02.804
in the middle of the freaking ocean.

12:02.888 --> 12:07.392
Believe me, they will find a way.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.160
My dear comrades, l have some sad news.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.413
The powers that be have decreed
that the "F" word is a word too far.

12:28.497 --> 12:32.625
But at least for now, even though our
dreams of freedom have died a tragic death,

12:32.835 --> 12:35.086

One day, in a world of dreams,
you'll be able to say "wank"

But "fuck," never.

is make advertising on the stations illegal

-Well, Dave said that he didn't really like it.

And he did that.
