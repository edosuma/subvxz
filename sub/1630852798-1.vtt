01:12.373 --> 01:14.841
<i>Have you
ever been inside a cage?</i>

01:14.976 --> 01:18.913
<i>Not a real one,
with metal bars and a lock,</i>

01:19.046 --> 01:21.916
<i>though I have had
some experience with those.</i>

01:22.049 --> 01:24.851
<i>No, I'm talking about
the kind of imaginary cage</i>

01:24.986 --> 01:27.321
<i>we build to protect ourselves.</i>

01:27.455 --> 01:29.823
<i>That's the kind of cage
that my friend Rob and I</i>

01:29.957 --> 01:32.659
<i>were trapped inside
when we were ten years old,</i>

01:32.792 --> 01:35.795
<i>before we unearthed the key
that would set us free</i>

01:35.930 --> 01:39.666
<i>and before we met
the magnificent creature</i>

01:39.799 --> 01:42.903
<i>who would change our lives
forever.</i>

02:54.008 --> 02:57.178
Hush.
Ain't no point in cryin'.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.415
Crying ain't gonna
bring her back.

03:01.549 --> 03:05.086
- Jesus said, "I go to prepare a place."
- Yes, sir.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.697
Looky here.
It's the Kentucky Star.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.233
How's it like
to be a star?

04:59.366 --> 05:02.236
Billy, he don't know
what it's like to be a star.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.417
Hey, guess what? This ain't Kentucky.
This is Florida.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.553
Yeah. You don't know what it's
like to be a star anywhere.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.523
Got it?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.391
Oh. Look at him.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.694
He's got creeping crud
all over him.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.063
God, he's gross.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.639
Hey, Mr. Nelson.
What are you doing?

05:38.771 --> 05:40.507
This ain't no stop,
Mr. Nelson.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.084
Hey, this is a school bus.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.385
I know that.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.554
You're all dressed up
to go to a party.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.055
This ain't no party bus.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.025
It's not my fault
you don't have good clothes.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.794
We're sorry.
We didn't mean nothing by it.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.163
What's your name?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.165
Sistine.

06:09.003 --> 06:11.739
Sistine? What kind of
stupid name is that?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.974
Like the chapel.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.244
What are you looking at?

06:18.078 --> 06:20.813
Yeah. What are you looking at,
disease boy?

06:22.815 --> 06:24.118
Come on.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.029
<i>You and me.</i>

06:35.162 --> 06:37.264
<i>We see the world the same.</i>

06:38.565 --> 06:41.969
<i>Hmm.</i>

06:44.171 --> 06:49.109
That's God giving life to Adam
with just his touch.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.878
That's what Michelangelo
was trying to say.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.049
Wow.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.584
And Michelangelo
didn't even want to paint it.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.087
He thought he was a better
sculptor than a painter.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.355
Can you believe that?

07:01.488 --> 07:03.057
No way.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.126
The whole ceiling
is a fresco.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.762
- You know what "fresco" means?
- No, ma'am.

07:08.895 --> 07:12.832
It means
that a painter goes in there

07:12.966 --> 07:18.038
and paints on all that plaster real fast...

07:40.961 --> 07:42.563
You got all them rooms
cleaned good?

07:42.696 --> 07:45.499
Have I ever not got all
these rooms cleaned good?

07:45.632 --> 07:49.036
Come to think of it,
I don't think so.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.404
Then let's just assume

07:50.537 --> 07:52.973
that I got all these rooms
cleaned really good.

07:53.107 --> 07:54.375
Save us both some time.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.276
Hey, girl,
don't you give me no lip.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.679
I ain't paying you
to be a smart mouth.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.648
You barely pay me
to breathe.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.286
Hey, man.

08:07.388 --> 08:09.223
Can you point me
out to the spa?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.225
- Spa?
- Yeah.

08:12.126 --> 08:14.995
Does this place look like
it has a spa to you?

08:16.196 --> 08:20.033
Sorry to hear
about your inadequacies.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.575
"Spa."

08:35.315 --> 08:36.817
My name is Sistine Bailey.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.623
What a lovely name.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.425
Thank you.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.361
I'm from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania,

08:47.494 --> 08:50.964
home of the Liberty Bell,
and I hate the South

08:51.098 --> 08:54.001
because the people in it
are ignorant.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.304
And I'm not staying here
in Lister.

08:57.438 --> 09:00.174
My father is coming
to get me next week.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.245
Thank you for introducing
yourself, Sistine Bailey.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.680
You may take your seat now

09:06.814 --> 09:09.316
before you put your foot
in your mouth any further.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.496
I want to talk
about last week's test.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.731
Y'all didn't do so great.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.001
We're gonna
figure this out together

09:28.135 --> 09:30.270
and see where we went wrong.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.206
We're gonna go over...

10:00.300 --> 10:02.469
Mom, I can't do this.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.204
Let me see that.

10:07.909 --> 10:10.177
Oh, sure you can
whittle that.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.279
I'll show you.
It ain't hard. Okay.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.548
Hey, buddy.
Don't jiggle that bed.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.083
Your mama's
in a lot of pain.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.318
He ain't hurting me,
Robert.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.055
Don't tire yourself out
with that wood.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.423
It's all right.

10:23.557 --> 10:27.127
I'm just teaching Rob
some things I know.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.696
There.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.199
Now you do some.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.141
See?

10:42.010 --> 10:43.644
You already know
what to do.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.812
Your hands know.

10:49.182 --> 10:52.553
You know, it helps with the whittling
when you stick your tongue out.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.754
Hmm?

11:02.696 --> 11:06.066
Rob, I need you to go
to the principal's office.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.402
Rob?

11:09.938 --> 11:12.006
Rob Horton?

11:12.139 --> 11:13.942
Mr. Phelmer wants to see you
in his office.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.475
Do you understand?

11:15.609 --> 11:17.344
Yes, ma'am.

11:24.953 --> 11:26.620
Billy, I saw that.

11:33.327 --> 11:34.795
Good morning, Rob.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.297
You doing okay today?

11:37.864 --> 11:38.832
Yes, sir.

11:38.967 --> 11:40.167
We've been
a bit worried.

11:40.300 --> 11:44.038
It's about your legs.
May I take a look?

11:44.171 --> 11:45.073
Yes, sir.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.573
Okay.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.544
Ooh. Uh...

11:52.646 --> 11:54.648
That doesn't look good,
does it?

11:56.149 --> 11:58.418
Yeah, that don't
look good at all.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.154
Look, uh...

12:01.288 --> 12:03.223
here's the situation, Rob.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.426
Some of the parents,

12:06.560 --> 12:10.297
and I'm not gonna mention names,
are worried that what you...

12:10.430 --> 12:13.166
what you got there
might be contagious.

12:13.300 --> 12:17.638
"Contagious," meaning something the
other students could possibly catch.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.907
Now, you tell me
the truth, son.

12:20.041 --> 12:22.376
You've been using that
medicine you told me about?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.678
- You've been puttin' that on?
- Yes, sir.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.748
Well, I'm gonna be up-front
and honest with you, Rob.

12:27.881 --> 12:31.218
I think it might be a good idea
if I let you stay home a few days.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.154
Give that medicine time
to kick in, work its magic,

12:34.287 --> 12:38.191
and then we'll bring you back to
school once your leg's better.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.061
Does that sound like a plan?

12:40.193 --> 12:41.194
That'd be all right.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.064
All right. Well, good.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.133
Well, here's what
I'm gonna do.

12:45.265 --> 12:49.269
I'm just gonna write a little
letter to your parents...

12:52.140 --> 12:53.774
I mean, your father.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.644
We'll let him know
what's what.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.680
And you tell him

13:01.082 --> 13:03.617
if he has
any questions at all,

13:03.750 --> 13:07.688
he can just give me a call,
all right?

13:08.956 --> 13:09.890
Yes, sir.

13:10.024 --> 13:11.692
All right.
There you go.

13:12.492 --> 13:16.830
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
See you around, bud.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.498
We all have our challenges.

13:42.190 --> 13:43.457
Why, thank you.

13:44.125 --> 13:45.459
My pleasure, ma'am.

13:47.161 --> 13:48.096
What's your name?

13:48.228 --> 13:49.463
Rob Horton.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.364
Very pleased
to meet you, Rob Horton.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.568
I'm Miss Mills.
What you got there?

13:54.701 --> 13:56.336
It ain't nothin'.

13:57.205 --> 13:58.805
May I see it?

14:00.474 --> 14:02.876
Well, look at that.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.277
Did you draw this?

14:04.411 --> 14:06.413
Yes, ma'am.
It ain't nothin'.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.217
Sure don't look like nothin'.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.119
You're a dang good artist, Rob.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.954
I wanna see more.

14:13.087 --> 14:15.990
Why don't you stop by tomorrow
and show me some of your artwork?

14:16.124 --> 14:17.858
I can't.

14:17.992 --> 14:21.828
Mr. Phelmer wants me to stay home for
a few days. On account of my legs.

14:25.099 --> 14:28.236
Well, I had a hard time
in fifth grade myself.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.537
I understand.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.707
When you come back,
make sure to stop by and see me. Promise?

14:33.840 --> 14:35.275
Yes, ma'am.

14:53.527 --> 14:56.563
Look where you came from, loser.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.885
Hey!

15:19.020 --> 15:20.154
Leave her alone!

15:23.024 --> 15:26.560
- Who are you talking to?
- Yeah. Who do you think you're talking to?

15:28.296 --> 15:29.931
I said, leave her alone.

15:30.064 --> 15:32.465
- You're gonna make me?
- Ooh!

16:32.692 --> 16:34.628
There isn't any place to sit.

16:37.898 --> 16:40.301
It's not like
I want to sit here.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.969
Okay.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.947
What's your name?

16:54.181 --> 16:55.415
Rob Horton.

16:56.918 --> 16:59.186
Well, let me tell you something,
Rob Horton.

17:00.654 --> 17:02.522
You shouldn't run.

17:02.656 --> 17:05.659
That's what they want you
to do is run.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.196
I hate it here.

17:10.330 --> 17:13.134
This is a stupid hick town
with stupid hick teachers.

17:13.267 --> 17:16.971
No one in the whole school even
knows what the Sistine Chapel is.

17:18.339 --> 17:19.571
I know.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.575
What?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.711
I know what
the Sistine Chapel is.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.681
I bet.
I bet you know.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.117
It's a picture of God
making the world,

17:30.251 --> 17:31.685
like it says in Genesis.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.054
It's in Italy.

17:33.187 --> 17:35.222
The pictures are painted
on the ceiling.

17:35.356 --> 17:36.958
They're frescoes.

17:44.898 --> 17:48.135
Uh, I don't gotta go to
school on account of my legs.

17:48.269 --> 17:50.004
I got a note
that says so.

17:50.137 --> 17:53.441
Mr. Phelmer, the principal,
says that the other parents are worried

17:53.573 --> 17:55.809
that what I got
is contagious.

18:02.716 --> 18:04.718
Please let me catch it.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.854
Please, please, please.

18:07.989 --> 18:11.192
Please, please, please
let me catch it.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.228
You won't.
It ain't contagious.

18:14.362 --> 18:15.930
Please, please, please.

18:16.063 --> 18:18.765
- It ain't a disease. It's just me.
- Please, please.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.373
Where do you live?

18:26.073 --> 18:28.641
In the motel.
The Kentucky Star.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.411
You live in a motel?

18:31.544 --> 18:34.714
It ain't permanent.
Just until we get back on our feet.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.622
Well, I'll bring you
your homework.

18:42.756 --> 18:44.791
I'll bring it to you
at the motel.

18:57.038 --> 18:59.572
That stuff ain't nothing
nobody else can catch.

19:00.374 --> 19:01.608
I know it.

19:04.311 --> 19:08.049
I told that to the principal once before.
Called him up and told him that.

19:09.016 --> 19:10.051
Yes, sir.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.756
You wanna stay home?

19:19.126 --> 19:20.928
I'll maybe make
an appointment,

19:21.761 --> 19:23.431
get one of them doctors
to write down

19:23.563 --> 19:25.166
what you got
ain't catching.

19:26.267 --> 19:27.301
Yes, sir.

19:29.136 --> 19:31.272
But I won't do it
for a few days.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.143
All right?
Give you some time off.

19:36.277 --> 19:37.710
That would be all right.

19:41.315 --> 19:42.349
You got to fight 'em.

19:43.451 --> 19:44.919
Them boys.

19:45.052 --> 19:47.021
I know you don't want to,
but you got to fight 'em.

19:47.154 --> 19:49.457
Else they won't ever
leave you alone.

20:03.037 --> 20:04.071
Yes, sir.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.706
All right.

20:07.908 --> 20:09.176
In the meantime,

20:09.977 --> 20:11.946
you can help me out
around here.

20:13.347 --> 20:15.849
Do some maintenance work for me,
some sweeping and cleaning.

20:15.983 --> 20:19.286
Beauchamp's running me ragged.
Don't know who the hell he thinks he is.

20:19.420 --> 20:22.223
Can't you just get a job
somewhere else?

20:28.661 --> 20:30.897
Go on and hand me
that medicine.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.322
Do you think Beauchamp is
the richest man in the world?

20:55.456 --> 20:57.057
No.

20:57.191 --> 20:59.393
He don't own but this one
itty-bitty motel now,

20:59.527 --> 21:01.028
and the woods.

21:01.162 --> 21:03.696
He likes to pretend
he's rich is all.

21:04.697 --> 21:08.035
All right. There you go.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.072
- Can I go outside?
- No.

21:12.206 --> 21:15.176
I don't want that medicine to get
rained off. It costs too much.

21:17.344 --> 21:20.014
Go and get washed up.
Gonna have supper.

21:27.988 --> 21:30.391
Someday you and me
are gonna have a house

21:30.524 --> 21:32.326
with a real stove.

21:37.231 --> 21:39.400
I'll do
some good cookin' then.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.542
This is good.

21:48.676 --> 21:50.344
Eat all you want.
I ain't hungry.

23:15.162 --> 23:17.498
It doesn't look
like no butterfly.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.669
Hmm? No, it don't.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.604
Looks like it wants
to be a fish.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.639
But I was whittling
a butterfly.

23:25.773 --> 23:28.442
But the wood
had other ideas.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.378
You can never tell what's
gonna come out of the wood.

23:31.512 --> 23:34.481
It does what it wants,
and you just follow.

23:35.848 --> 23:38.452
Go on. You might as well
finish your fish.

23:48.629 --> 23:50.164
Put me down!

25:47.948 --> 25:51.251
<i>Come on, son.</i>

25:52.219 --> 25:54.121
Come on.
You're a working man now.

25:54.254 --> 25:56.089
Got to get up.

26:06.567 --> 26:08.101
You know what?

26:08.235 --> 26:09.203
No, ma'am.

26:09.336 --> 26:11.104
I'll tell you what.

26:11.238 --> 26:12.840
I'd rather clean up
after pigs in a barn

26:12.973 --> 26:15.809
than clean up behind some
of the people in this place.

26:15.944 --> 26:18.011
Pigs at least give you
some respect.

26:48.141 --> 26:49.376
What you staring at?

26:52.981 --> 26:55.115
What you doing
out of school?

26:55.249 --> 26:56.316
I don't know.

26:56.450 --> 26:58.552
What you mean,
you don't know?

26:58.685 --> 27:00.821
Don't be shaking your
shoulders up and down to me

27:00.955 --> 27:03.624
like some little bird tryin'
to fly away or somethin'.

27:03.757 --> 27:06.793
You want to end up cleaning
motel rooms for a living?

27:06.928 --> 27:11.465
That's right.
Ain't nobody want this job.

27:11.598 --> 27:14.101
I'm the only fool
Beauchamp can pay to do it.

27:15.469 --> 27:19.439
You better stay in school,
else you'll end up like me.

27:38.225 --> 27:40.093
Tell me why
you ain't in school.

27:40.227 --> 27:43.031
On account of my legs
being all broke out.

27:43.163 --> 27:44.731
Hmm.

27:48.068 --> 27:49.436
How long have you had that?

27:49.570 --> 27:51.305
A while.

27:52.673 --> 27:55.409
You know I can tell you
how to cure that.

27:55.542 --> 27:58.478
I can tell you right now.
Ain't got to go to no doctor.

27:58.612 --> 27:59.780
Huh?

28:01.782 --> 28:02.951
Sadness.

28:03.918 --> 28:07.220
You carryin' all that sadness
down low in your legs.

28:07.354 --> 28:10.857
Not letting it get up
to your heart, where it belongs.

28:12.060 --> 28:14.595
You got to let
that sadness rise up.

28:14.728 --> 28:17.130
The principal thinks
it's contagious.

28:18.265 --> 28:19.833
Man ain't got no sense.

28:21.201 --> 28:22.736
He's got all these certificates,

28:22.869 --> 28:25.572
and they're framed
and hung up on his wall.

28:25.706 --> 28:29.209
I'll bet he ain't got one
for sense, huh?

28:32.412 --> 28:34.548
I got to clean
some more rooms.

28:34.681 --> 28:37.184
You ain't gonna forget
what I told you though, are you?

28:37.317 --> 28:38.885
- No, ma'am.
- What'd I tell you?

28:39.020 --> 28:40.787
To let the sadness rise.

28:40.922 --> 28:44.825
That's right.
You let that sadness rise on up.

29:05.245 --> 29:07.180
Hey, disease boy!

29:24.065 --> 29:26.934
Here comes your
girlfriend, disease boy!

29:35.076 --> 29:36.010
Hey.

29:36.144 --> 29:37.711
Hey.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.613
I brought your homework.

29:43.017 --> 29:44.251
Thanks.

29:47.354 --> 29:49.423
That art teacher
was asking for you.

29:49.556 --> 29:51.525
She had glue in her hair.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.200
Why is this place called
the Kentucky Star?

30:00.333 --> 30:02.836
Because Beauchamp,
the owner,

30:02.970 --> 30:06.673
he had a horse once,
named it Kentucky Star.

30:06.807 --> 30:09.242
Well, it's a stupid name
for a motel in Florida.

30:09.376 --> 30:11.745
He must be extremely stupid.

30:18.218 --> 30:19.720
Fine, then.

30:35.736 --> 30:37.704
I know
where there's a tiger.

30:42.709 --> 30:43.777
Where?

30:44.244 --> 30:45.479
Come on.

30:46.613 --> 30:50.017
Well, we gotta walk
through the woods.

30:50.151 --> 30:53.487
Oh, well, you can just give me
some of your clothes to wear.

30:53.620 --> 30:55.288
I hate this outfit anyway.

30:55.422 --> 30:56.890
This way.

31:03.396 --> 31:04.999
Good Lord!

31:14.708 --> 31:17.778
Sorry.
We don't get much company.

31:20.447 --> 31:22.049
Oh, my goodness.

31:30.490 --> 31:32.292
Where did you get them?

31:32.927 --> 31:34.427
I made them.

31:36.530 --> 31:38.532
Michelangelo,

31:38.665 --> 31:41.535
the man who painted
the Sistine ceiling...

31:43.137 --> 31:44.638
he sculpted too.

31:46.941 --> 31:48.475
You're a sculptor.

31:51.444 --> 31:53.080
You're an artist.

31:56.017 --> 31:57.317
No.

32:10.064 --> 32:11.498
Oh.

32:17.071 --> 32:18.839
It's...

32:20.975 --> 32:22.342
perfect.

32:23.844 --> 32:27.114
It's like looking into
a little wooden mirror.

32:28.348 --> 32:30.017
What are you looking at?

32:32.186 --> 32:36.523
Come on. Give me some
clothes so we can go see the tiger.

32:46.033 --> 32:47.400
Here you go.

32:49.769 --> 32:52.873
Excuse me.
May I have some privacy, please?

32:53.007 --> 32:54.407
Right.

33:36.783 --> 33:38.252
Now, show me this tiger.

33:46.294 --> 33:49.030
This is where
my mother grew up.

33:49.729 --> 33:51.498
Right here in Lister.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.634
And she always told herself

33:54.768 --> 33:57.305
that if she ever
made it out of here,

33:57.437 --> 33:59.673
she was not
going to come back.

34:01.309 --> 34:02.776
But now she's back

34:02.910 --> 34:06.013
'cause my father had an
affair with his secretary,

34:07.480 --> 34:10.016
whose name is Bridgette

34:10.684 --> 34:12.053
and who can't even type,

34:12.186 --> 34:14.688
which is a really,
really bad thing for a secretary,

34:14.821 --> 34:16.958
like, not to be able to do.

34:20.860 --> 34:23.697
He's coming down here
to get me.

34:23.830 --> 34:25.032
Soon.

34:25.166 --> 34:26.833
Next week, probably.

34:28.268 --> 34:31.871
I'm definitely not staying
here, that's for sure.

34:34.241 --> 34:36.810
Ain't you worried
about messing up your shoes?

34:37.844 --> 34:40.647
No. I hate these shoes.

34:40.780 --> 34:42.449
I hate every single piece
of clothing

34:42.581 --> 34:44.118
that my mother
makes me wear.

34:46.454 --> 34:47.989
This way.

34:50.590 --> 34:52.726
Does your mother
live with you?

34:52.859 --> 34:54.362
No.

34:54.494 --> 34:55.895
Where is she?

34:57.298 --> 35:00.368
My mother's going to open up
a store downtown.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.169
It's gonna be an art store.

35:02.303 --> 35:06.506
She's gonna bring some
culture to this backward town.

35:06.639 --> 35:09.176
She could sell some
of your wood sculptures.

35:09.310 --> 35:12.579
They ain't sculptures.
Just whittling, that's all.

35:12.712 --> 35:14.614
No. I said
they're sculptures.

35:14.748 --> 35:18.752
We got to be quiet. Beauchamp don't
want people walking around on his land.

35:19.453 --> 35:20.854
Is this his land?

35:20.988 --> 35:23.556
Yeah. Everything's his.

35:23.690 --> 35:25.525
The motel, the woods,

35:25.658 --> 35:26.860
everything.

35:27.627 --> 35:29.430
He can't own
everything.

35:29.562 --> 35:31.831
Besides,
I don't care.

35:31.966 --> 35:35.169
He can catch us.
He can put us in jail for trespassing.

35:35.302 --> 35:36.836
I don't care.

35:36.971 --> 35:40.041
Well, if we're in jail,
we won't get to see the tiger.

35:41.375 --> 35:42.510
Where's your mother?

35:42.642 --> 35:44.345
Shh!
You got to be quiet.

35:44.478 --> 35:46.846
I do not have to be quiet!

35:46.981 --> 35:49.216
I want to know where
your mother is.

35:51.385 --> 35:54.121
You know, you don't know
how to talk to people.

35:54.255 --> 35:56.924
I told you about my father
and my mother and Bridgette,

35:57.058 --> 35:59.260
and you didn't
even say anything.

35:59.393 --> 36:01.195
You won't even tell me
about your mother.

36:01.328 --> 36:06.167
Keep your stupid secrets.
Keep your stupid tiger too.

36:06.300 --> 36:09.203
I don't care!

36:15.608 --> 36:17.912
Wait up! Wait up!

36:18.045 --> 36:19.712
Well?

36:24.452 --> 36:26.220
She's dead.

36:26.353 --> 36:28.556
My mama's dead.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.165
Okay.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.357
- Well, where's the tiger?
- Just hold on. He's right around the back.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.135
Oh.

37:26.447 --> 37:28.616
He's beautiful.

37:28.748 --> 37:31.851
Don't get too close.
He might not like it.

37:32.486 --> 37:34.155
It's just like the poem.

37:34.288 --> 37:35.556
What?

37:35.722 --> 37:37.424
The one that goes,

37:37.558 --> 37:41.761
"Tyger, tyger, burning bright,
in the forests of the night."

37:43.130 --> 37:44.864
It's just like that.

37:45.899 --> 37:47.901
He burns bright.

37:48.035 --> 37:50.538
Oh.

37:50.670 --> 37:51.972
Yeah.

37:52.872 --> 37:54.308
What's he doing way out here?

37:54.441 --> 37:57.278
I don't know.
He's Beauchamp's, I guess.

37:57.411 --> 38:00.548
- Beauchamp's what? His pet?
- I don't know.

38:00.680 --> 38:03.984
I just like to come out here and
look at him. Maybe he does too.

38:04.118 --> 38:06.587
That's selfish.

38:06.719 --> 38:10.324
This isn't right for this tiger
to be in a cage. It's not right.

38:10.457 --> 38:13.394
Well, we can't do
nothin' about it.

38:15.129 --> 38:17.631
We could let him go.
We could set him free.

38:17.764 --> 38:20.234
Nuh-uh.
There's all them locks.

38:20.367 --> 38:22.269
We could saw through them.

38:22.403 --> 38:23.836
No.

38:23.971 --> 38:25.673
We have to set him free.

38:25.805 --> 38:27.641
Nuh-uh.
It ain't our tiger to let go.

38:27.774 --> 38:29.842
But it is our tiger to save!

38:33.647 --> 38:34.682
Shh!

38:35.715 --> 38:38.018
It's a car. A car's coming!
It's Beauchamp!

38:38.152 --> 38:39.852
We got to go!
Come on!

38:45.993 --> 38:47.394
Is he behind us?

38:49.697 --> 38:51.599
Stop shrugging
your shoulders at me.

38:51.731 --> 38:52.832
I hate it.

38:52.967 --> 38:54.435
I hate the way
you shrug all the time!

38:54.568 --> 38:58.005
You look like a big,
stupid bird flapping its wings!

39:12.852 --> 39:14.154
Rob!

39:15.055 --> 39:16.823
- Yes, sir?
- Where you been?

39:16.957 --> 39:18.825
Out in the woods.

39:18.959 --> 39:22.696
- Finish all them jobs I told you to do?
- Yes, sir.

39:22.829 --> 39:25.733
All right.
Who you got with you?

39:25.865 --> 39:27.434
This is Sistine.

39:28.801 --> 39:30.304
Sistine.

39:34.441 --> 39:35.376
This yours?

39:35.509 --> 39:37.478
Yes, it is.

39:40.481 --> 39:41.515
You live around here?

39:41.649 --> 39:42.916
For now.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.918
Your folks know
you're out here?

39:45.052 --> 39:47.354
I was going
to call my mother.

39:47.488 --> 39:52.526
We got a pay phone
over in the laundry room.

39:52.660 --> 39:54.328
In the laundry room?

39:54.461 --> 39:57.364
We don't got a phone
in the motel room.

39:59.333 --> 40:02.403
Well, can I have
some change, at least?

40:03.737 --> 40:06.240
Oh, yeah.

40:13.813 --> 40:15.382
Do you want me
to go with you?

40:15.516 --> 40:19.286
No. I'll find it,
thank you very much.

40:24.124 --> 40:28.562
She certainly
seems to be a handful.

40:28.696 --> 40:30.264
Yes, sir.

40:32.099 --> 40:34.501
What's she doing
in your clothes?

40:34.635 --> 40:36.203
Well,
she had a dress on.

40:36.337 --> 40:38.906
It was too pretty
to wear it in the woods.

40:39.473 --> 40:40.840
Okay.

40:43.677 --> 40:46.113
All right.
Go on in.

40:46.246 --> 40:47.847
Let's get that medicine
on your legs.

40:47.981 --> 40:49.550
Yes, sir.

41:26.754 --> 41:27.988
My mother's coming
to get me.

41:28.122 --> 41:30.023
Here's your clothes.

41:41.568 --> 41:43.036
How come you don't have
a phone?

41:43.170 --> 41:45.939
Hmm. Ain't nobody to call,
I guess.

41:48.909 --> 41:51.044
I like to look up
at things.

41:53.213 --> 41:55.182
So do my mother
and father.

42:01.321 --> 42:03.223
That's how they met.

42:04.425 --> 42:07.027
They were looking up at the
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel

42:07.161 --> 42:11.665
and they weren't watching where they
were going and bumped into each other.

42:16.069 --> 42:18.138
That's why
I'm named Sistine.

42:21.208 --> 42:22.943
I like your name.

42:36.356 --> 42:38.225
How did your mother die?

42:39.993 --> 42:41.562
Cancer.

42:45.966 --> 42:47.534
What was her name?

42:49.169 --> 42:51.538
I ain't supposed
to talk about her.

42:52.739 --> 42:54.007
Why not?

42:54.909 --> 42:56.677
Because.

42:56.810 --> 43:00.247
My dad says it don't do
no good to talk about her.

43:00.380 --> 43:03.517
He says that she's gone,

43:03.650 --> 43:06.987
and there ain't nothing
we can do about it.

43:08.622 --> 43:11.358
That's why we moved here
from Jacksonville.

43:13.660 --> 43:17.097
Because everybody always
wants to talk about her.

43:19.366 --> 43:22.102
We moved here
to get on with things.

43:29.309 --> 43:31.078
That's my mother.

43:31.211 --> 43:33.213
Okay.
I'll come back tomorrow.

43:33.347 --> 43:36.183
Then we'll make our plans
to let the tiger go.

43:38.519 --> 43:41.121
Sissy!
Baby, what in the world?

43:41.255 --> 43:43.824
What in the world
are you doing out here?

43:44.691 --> 43:46.627
Oh, good lord!
What have you got on?

43:46.760 --> 43:47.962
Clothes.

43:48.095 --> 43:50.264
Sissy, you look like a hobo.
Get in the car.

43:58.907 --> 44:00.107
Well, you must be Rob.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.442
- What's your last name, Rob?
- Horton.

44:02.576 --> 44:06.480
Horton. Are you related to Seldon
Horton, the congressman?

44:07.781 --> 44:08.715
Congressman?

44:08.849 --> 44:09.951
Mm-hmm.

44:10.083 --> 44:12.286
No, ma'am.
I don't think so.

44:12.419 --> 44:13.453
Hmm.

44:14.154 --> 44:16.189
Sissy, get in the car.

44:17.457 --> 44:19.826
She won't listen
to a word I say.

44:19.961 --> 44:23.096
Her father is the only one she'll
listen to. Her father, the liar.

44:23.230 --> 44:25.666
You're the liar!
You're the one who lies!

44:25.799 --> 44:28.335
Sistine!
Good lord!

44:30.871 --> 44:31.940
- Seat belt, missy!
- I know!

44:52.092 --> 44:53.594
Caroline.

44:55.228 --> 44:57.297
Her name was Caroline.

45:09.476 --> 45:10.210
Now?

45:10.344 --> 45:12.245
No, not yet.

45:14.414 --> 45:16.450
Hold your horses.

45:18.052 --> 45:18.987
Now?

45:19.119 --> 45:21.121
Yes, go ahead.
Plug it in.

45:25.927 --> 45:27.594
There you go.

45:27.728 --> 45:28.895
Wow!

45:29.030 --> 45:31.198
Nice job, you two.

46:03.897 --> 46:05.666
You ever been to a zoo?

46:06.533 --> 46:08.602
I've been to
that one over in Sorley.

46:08.735 --> 46:10.771
Place stunk
to high heaven.

46:12.572 --> 46:16.443
Do you think them animals
minded being locked up?

46:16.576 --> 46:19.413
Well, nobody asking them
if they minded.

46:20.580 --> 46:24.284
Do you think it's bad
keepin' animals locked up?

46:28.889 --> 46:31.458
You know,
when I wasn't but little,

46:31.591 --> 46:35.595
my daddy bought me
a bird in a cage.

46:35.729 --> 46:38.231
It was a little green
parakeet bird.

46:39.900 --> 46:40.767
That thing was so small,

46:40.901 --> 46:42.970
it could fit
in the palm of my hand.

46:44.204 --> 46:46.074
I could see
his little heart beating.

46:46.206 --> 46:49.810
He would look at me and cock his
head like this and like that.

46:50.978 --> 46:54.982
I named him Cricket,
on account of him singin' all the time.

46:56.349 --> 46:58.819
And what happened to him?

46:58.953 --> 47:00.787
I let him go.

47:00.922 --> 47:02.156
You let him go?

47:02.289 --> 47:03.925
Yep.

47:04.058 --> 47:06.928
I couldn't stand seein'
him locked up in that cage,

47:07.061 --> 47:08.562
so I let him go.

47:09.296 --> 47:10.965
So what happened?

47:12.033 --> 47:13.500
I got beat by my daddy.

47:14.701 --> 47:17.504
He said I ain't do
that bird no favors.

47:17.637 --> 47:20.074
All I did was give
some snake his supper.

47:20.674 --> 47:23.744
So you never saw him again?

47:23.877 --> 47:24.912
Mm-mmm.

47:26.080 --> 47:29.449
He comes flying through my
dreams every once in a while,

47:29.583 --> 47:31.618
flitting about and singing.

47:33.587 --> 47:35.689
Is that why
you're humming all the time?

47:37.390 --> 47:40.360
Maybe.

47:47.901 --> 47:50.470
I know something
that's in a cage.

47:52.873 --> 47:54.608
Who don't?

47:58.478 --> 48:00.514
Don't you
walk away from me!

48:00.647 --> 48:02.049
Hey!

48:02.183 --> 48:03.750
You do
what I tell you to do,

48:03.884 --> 48:06.453
and you won't give me
no back talk.

48:07.754 --> 48:09.289
All right.

48:10.524 --> 48:13.027
All right,
all right, all right.

48:25.672 --> 48:28.842
Well, looky here.

48:29.609 --> 48:31.678
We got you
on the payroll now?

48:32.779 --> 48:33.780
No, sir.

48:33.915 --> 48:36.583
What,
you're working for free?

48:36.716 --> 48:38.852
All right.
That's what I like to hear.

48:38.986 --> 48:40.720
- Yes, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

48:40.854 --> 48:44.025
Ain't you supposed
to be in school, hmm?

48:44.158 --> 48:46.160
Or you done graduated
already?

48:46.294 --> 48:47.394
I'm sick.

48:47.527 --> 48:49.896
Sick and tired of school,
I bet, huh?

48:50.031 --> 48:53.900
Ain't got no mama
setting down the rules for you.

48:54.035 --> 48:57.571
You can just
make up your own rules, huh?

48:59.207 --> 49:01.775
Well, listen.

49:02.709 --> 49:06.880
I got me a number of
deals going on right now,

49:07.014 --> 49:10.017
a few more
than I could handle properly.

49:10.151 --> 49:12.920
I was wondering
if maybe a smart boy like you

49:13.054 --> 49:16.790
was looking for a way to pick up
some extra spending money.

49:17.691 --> 49:19.961
Yeah? Let me tell you
what I got cookin'.

49:21.128 --> 49:23.030
You like animals?

49:23.164 --> 49:26.399
Of course, you do.
What boy doesn't like animals, right?

49:27.335 --> 49:30.737
But do you like wild animals?

49:31.272 --> 49:32.672
Yeah.

49:32.806 --> 49:36.877
'Cause I got me a wild animal
a couple of days back.

49:37.011 --> 49:41.215
I got me a wild animal
like you wouldn't believe

49:41.349 --> 49:43.850
right here on this property.

49:43.985 --> 49:46.486
And I got plans for him.

49:46.620 --> 49:49.957
I got some
big, big, big plans.

49:50.091 --> 49:52.326
Only thing is,

49:52.459 --> 49:54.295
he, uh...

49:54.427 --> 49:55.997
he needs some
taking care of.

49:56.130 --> 49:58.632
You know,
like some daily maintenance.

49:59.699 --> 50:01.035
You following me, son?

50:01.168 --> 50:03.637
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

50:03.770 --> 50:07.241
Get in the jeep. I'll take you for a
ride, show you what I'm talking about.

50:07.375 --> 50:09.476
But I'm supposed
to be sweeping.

50:12.013 --> 50:13.214
Says who?

50:14.148 --> 50:16.918
What, that worthless daddy
of yours, huh?

50:17.051 --> 50:20.787
He ain't the boss.
He ain't nobody's boss.

50:22.990 --> 50:24.392
I'm the boss.

50:24.524 --> 50:28.195
So when I say, "Let's go,"

50:28.329 --> 50:31.498
you say, "All right."

50:32.766 --> 50:35.970
So, let's go.

50:36.938 --> 50:38.172
All right.

50:47.580 --> 50:49.016
Climb on up.

50:50.717 --> 50:53.154
Here, let me take that for you.
Put it in the back.

50:57.158 --> 50:59.826
Ah, don't worry about that.
That's just the meat.

50:59.961 --> 51:03.130
It won't hurt you. Wipe your hands.

51:20.814 --> 51:23.918
You ain't gonna believe
what I'm gonna show you.

51:24.517 --> 51:25.485
No, sir.

51:25.618 --> 51:26.720
What?

51:26.853 --> 51:29.789
No, sir.
I ain't gonna believe it.

51:41.835 --> 51:44.637
Keep them eyes closed.
Don't you cheat.

51:44.771 --> 51:46.840
We're almost there.

51:47.908 --> 51:51.578
Don't peek. Don't peek.

51:53.613 --> 51:56.017
All right.
Let's get you outta there.

51:57.118 --> 51:59.420
All right.
You keeping them closed?

51:59.552 --> 52:02.522
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Come on.

52:03.958 --> 52:06.293
All right. Almost there.

52:06.427 --> 52:07.660
Don't you be a cheater, now.

52:07.794 --> 52:09.397
- Nobody likes a cheater.
- Yes, sir.

52:09.529 --> 52:10.797
All right now.

52:10.931 --> 52:13.267
Open up your eyes.
Tell me what you see.

52:14.502 --> 52:16.470
It's a tiger!

52:16.603 --> 52:19.306
Mmm.
Damn straight!

52:19.440 --> 52:21.308
King of the jungle.

52:21.442 --> 52:23.676
And he's all mine.

52:24.445 --> 52:26.514
Wow! You own him?

52:26.646 --> 52:28.548
That's right.

52:31.018 --> 52:34.721
A fellow I know,
he owed me some money.

52:34.854 --> 52:36.790
He paid me with a tiger.

52:37.590 --> 52:39.460
That's how real men
do business.

52:39.592 --> 52:40.894
In tigers.

52:41.028 --> 52:44.564
That's right.
Real men do business in tigers.

52:45.433 --> 52:46.833
That's right.

52:46.967 --> 52:49.370
What do you want to do with him?

52:49.503 --> 52:51.906
I'm weighing my options.

52:52.705 --> 52:55.842
Maybe I was thinking
about putting him

52:55.976 --> 52:59.779
right up there
in front of the Kentucky Star.

52:59.914 --> 53:02.615
He'd bring in a whole bunch
of business to the motel.

53:02.749 --> 53:03.783
Wouldn't you?

53:15.496 --> 53:18.099
Or maybe I'll just kill him.

53:18.232 --> 53:20.935
Maybe I'll skin him up,
make me a tiger coat.

53:21.068 --> 53:24.939
Can you imagine me
in a big old tiger coat, huh?

53:25.072 --> 53:27.740
Dang, I think I'd look good.

53:28.608 --> 53:29.910
Huh?

53:30.044 --> 53:33.813
Anyway, I ain't completely
made up my mind yet.

53:34.814 --> 53:37.817
But I'll tell you what...
he's a lot of work.

53:38.651 --> 53:41.821
He has to eat meat
twice a day.

53:41.956 --> 53:44.657
That's where you
come in.

53:46.759 --> 53:50.297
I need you to come out here
and feed him for me,

53:50.431 --> 53:54.235
and I'll give you two dollars
every time you do it.

53:54.368 --> 53:55.735
How's that sound?

53:57.905 --> 54:00.274
How do I get the meat
in the cage?

54:00.407 --> 54:01.841
I'm gonna show you.

54:03.144 --> 54:04.278
Looky here.

54:07.548 --> 54:09.517
See these keys?

54:09.649 --> 54:11.751
See this one little key
right here

54:11.885 --> 54:14.854
with the red F on it? Huh?

54:14.989 --> 54:16.756
Don't pay any attention
to these keys,

54:16.890 --> 54:18.658
because these keys
open the big door,

54:18.791 --> 54:22.429
and the big tiger will come out of
there and he'll eat you for sure.

54:22.563 --> 54:24.098
You understand?

54:26.167 --> 54:29.937
So you take this little
key with the red F,

54:30.070 --> 54:32.907
just come out here
to this little door,

54:33.040 --> 54:36.776
and you open up
this little lock here like that.

54:37.444 --> 54:39.280
Yep. Ah.

54:39.413 --> 54:41.282
Take out your meat.

54:42.616 --> 54:44.084
Ha.

54:44.218 --> 54:49.089
And you throw it in one piece at a
time, just like this.

54:55.529 --> 54:56.763
Damn!

55:04.837 --> 55:08.075
Anyway,
that's all there is to it.

55:11.612 --> 55:13.480
What's the tiger's name?

55:13.614 --> 55:15.015
Name?

55:15.149 --> 55:17.051
He don't have a name.

55:17.184 --> 55:20.753
You don't need to name something you're
throwing a piece of meat to, dummy.

55:22.223 --> 55:24.325
Come over here.

55:24.458 --> 55:26.927
I'll introduce you proper.
Come on.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.735
All right, tiger.

55:36.503 --> 55:37.905
See this kid here?

55:38.038 --> 55:41.275
He's your new meal ticket,
not me. All right?

55:41.408 --> 55:43.843
He's got the keys.
Take the keys.

55:43.978 --> 55:47.248
He's got the keys, not me.
Understand?

55:52.219 --> 55:53.721
All right.

55:53.853 --> 55:55.990
Now you two
know each other.

56:18.979 --> 56:20.547
You all right, boy?

56:21.881 --> 56:23.417
- Y-Y-Yes, sir.
- Yeah?

56:23.783 --> 56:24.884
All right.

56:25.019 --> 56:27.621
Well, don't you worry
about him.

56:27.755 --> 56:30.024
You'll be all right.

56:30.157 --> 56:32.493
He's stupid anyway.

56:49.109 --> 56:52.546
All right.
Come here. Come here.

56:52.680 --> 56:55.683
Now, this is
our business deal.

56:55.815 --> 56:58.885
It don't concern nobody else.
Right?

56:59.787 --> 57:00.853
All right.

57:00.988 --> 57:03.057
I want you
to take this bag of meat,

57:03.190 --> 57:05.125
I want you
to hide it somewhere.

57:05.259 --> 57:08.429
And tomorrow, I'm gonna bring
you another bag of meat.

57:08.562 --> 57:10.164
And in the meantime,

57:11.065 --> 57:13.967
you're gonna keep
your mouth shut.

57:14.101 --> 57:15.436
Understand, boy?

57:21.542 --> 57:23.243
Is that you, Rob Horton?

57:24.978 --> 57:26.413
Yes, ma'am.

57:27.147 --> 57:28.515
Are you okay, Rob?

57:28.649 --> 57:30.250
Yes, ma'am.

57:31.752 --> 57:34.154
What you lookin' at,
missy?

57:34.288 --> 57:36.623
She's the art teacher
from school.

57:37.358 --> 57:38.992
Are you sure
you're okay, Rob?

57:39.126 --> 57:41.195
He already done told you
he's okay.

57:41.328 --> 57:43.863
Now, why don't you just take
your purple hair

57:43.997 --> 57:46.200
and head on down the street,
missy.

57:47.067 --> 57:49.303
Make sure you come
and see me when you're back.

57:50.804 --> 57:51.972
Your fly's open.

57:52.106 --> 57:53.640
Hey,
I told you to get!

58:00.381 --> 58:02.416
You remember what I told you.

58:02.549 --> 58:04.884
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

59:00.741 --> 59:02.075
Hey, leprosy boy!

59:03.310 --> 59:06.680
Hey, here comes your girlfriend,
leprosy boy!

59:06.814 --> 59:08.615
You gonna kiss her?

59:08.749 --> 59:10.651
Yeah.
Kiss her. Kiss her.

59:14.054 --> 59:15.956
Let's go see the tiger.

59:38.579 --> 59:41.515
Tigers are
an endangered species.

59:42.883 --> 59:44.218
It's up to us to save him.

59:44.351 --> 59:47.454
We gotta be careful.
He peed all over Beauchamp.

59:48.222 --> 59:50.891
Did he really?
That's wonderful!

59:51.058 --> 59:52.860
He stunk terrible.

59:52.993 --> 59:57.030
That just means he was spraying his
territory, marking what he owns.

59:57.164 --> 01:00:01.235
Mr. Stupid doesn't realize
that the tiger really owns him.

01:00:02.035 --> 01:00:04.137
Watch out
he don't attack you.

01:00:05.172 --> 01:00:06.640
He won't.

01:00:06.773 --> 01:00:09.009
Tigers only attack people
if they're desperately hungry.

01:00:09.142 --> 01:00:11.111
This one ain't hungry.

01:00:11.245 --> 01:00:12.346
How do you know?

01:00:12.479 --> 01:00:17.017
Um, well,
he ain't skinny, is he?

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:19.286
He don't look starved.

01:00:27.394 --> 01:00:28.362
Keys.

01:00:28.495 --> 01:00:29.830
What?

01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:33.734
I got the keys to the cage.

01:00:34.735 --> 01:00:36.503
- How?
- Beauchamp.

01:00:36.637 --> 01:00:39.106
He hired me to feed his tiger
and he gave me the keys.

01:00:39.239 --> 01:00:40.641
All right.

01:00:40.774 --> 01:00:43.744
Now, all we have to do is
open the locks and let him go.

01:00:43.877 --> 01:00:45.445
No.

01:00:45.579 --> 01:00:46.647
Are you crazy?

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.616
It ain't safe.
It ain't safe for him.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:52.252
My friend Willie May,
she had a bird and let it go,

01:00:52.386 --> 01:00:53.922
and it just got ate up.

01:00:54.054 --> 01:00:54.989
What?

01:00:55.122 --> 01:00:57.090
You're not making any sense.

01:00:57.224 --> 01:00:59.726
This is a tiger,
not a bird.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:02.763
And I don't know who Willie May
is, and I don't care.

01:01:02.896 --> 01:01:04.966
You can't stop me
from letting this tiger go.

01:01:05.098 --> 01:01:08.802
I'll do it without the keys.
I'll saw the locks off myself.

01:01:08.937 --> 01:01:09.903
Don't.

01:01:10.038 --> 01:01:11.405
"Don't."

01:01:12.839 --> 01:01:15.009
I can't wait for my dad
to come and get me.

01:01:15.142 --> 01:01:16.743
When he gets here,

01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:19.446
I'm going to make him come out
here and set this tiger free.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.648
That's the first thing we'll do.

01:01:26.853 --> 01:01:28.088
Don't.

01:01:37.297 --> 01:01:41.002
I'll get you out of here.
I promise.

01:01:51.913 --> 01:01:53.347
I got you.

01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:56.216
I got
good hold of you.

01:02:11.398 --> 01:02:14.035
This is terrible.
Just terrible.

01:02:14.167 --> 01:02:15.202
What is?

01:02:15.335 --> 01:02:17.204
It's just not right.

01:02:19.539 --> 01:02:22.209
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

01:02:28.049 --> 01:02:30.317
Now he can see the stars.

01:02:39.726 --> 01:02:42.729
Look.
That's the Big Dipper.

01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:46.733
- Where?
- Over here.

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.669
Do you see it?

01:02:48.802 --> 01:02:52.873
Oh, right. I see it.

01:02:53.707 --> 01:02:57.945
It kinda looks like
the tail of a big bear.

01:02:58.079 --> 01:03:00.781
You're right. It is.

01:03:01.949 --> 01:03:06.120
You know, the Big Dipper
is really part of Ursa Major.

01:03:06.253 --> 01:03:08.022
That means the Great Bear.

01:03:08.156 --> 01:03:09.456
Oh.

01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:19.399
I think he sees the bear too.

01:03:22.836 --> 01:03:25.472
Yeah. He does.

01:03:31.645 --> 01:03:32.879
You see?

01:03:33.714 --> 01:03:35.615
That was
the right thing to do.

01:03:49.197 --> 01:03:50.330
Whoa.

01:03:50.464 --> 01:03:52.466
Did you see
that shooting star?

01:03:52.599 --> 01:03:56.269
Yeah.
It was really fast.

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:04.478
If a tiger and a bear
got into a fight,

01:04:04.611 --> 01:04:06.613
who do you think
would win?

01:04:08.348 --> 01:04:09.816
The tiger.

01:04:11.585 --> 01:04:13.988
Especially
if it was our tiger.

01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:23.563
I gotta call my mother.

01:04:23.697 --> 01:04:25.632
She's gonna be mad.

01:04:26.266 --> 01:04:27.801
I'll go with you.

01:04:27.935 --> 01:04:29.569
Boo!

01:04:31.772 --> 01:04:34.274
- Hey.
- Hey, there. Who's your friend?

01:04:34.407 --> 01:04:36.276
This is Sistine.

01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:38.179
Sistine,
meet Willie May.

01:04:38.311 --> 01:04:41.681
She's the one I told you about,
who had a bird and let it go.

01:04:41.815 --> 01:04:43.050
So what?

01:04:44.584 --> 01:04:45.953
So nothin'.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.189
So I had me a bird.

01:04:48.321 --> 01:04:51.591
Why are you hanging around
here, trying to scare people?

01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:54.594
I ain't trying to scare no one.

01:04:54.728 --> 01:04:56.730
Willie May
works here.

01:04:57.397 --> 01:04:58.632
That's right.

01:04:58.765 --> 01:05:00.400
You know what? I know you.

01:05:00.534 --> 01:05:03.171
You ain't got to
introduce yourself to me.

01:05:03.303 --> 01:05:04.838
You angry.

01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:08.475
You got a whole world of anger
inside of you.

01:05:08.608 --> 01:05:12.646
I know anger when I meet it.
Been angry most of my life.

01:05:13.446 --> 01:05:14.881
I'm not angry.

01:05:15.682 --> 01:05:18.718
Yeah, all right.
You a angry liar, then.

01:05:21.255 --> 01:05:22.489
Here you go.

01:05:51.618 --> 01:05:55.689
Ain't that just like God,
throwing you two together?

01:05:55.822 --> 01:05:58.558
This boy full of sorrow,
carrying it all low in his legs,

01:05:58.692 --> 01:06:01.329
and you, you full of anger.

01:06:01.461 --> 01:06:03.998
Got it snapping out of you
like lightning.

01:06:05.398 --> 01:06:08.035
You a pair.
That's the truth.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.707
How tall are you?

01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:16.077
6'2".

01:06:18.378 --> 01:06:20.380
I'm gonna
get myself home.

01:06:23.817 --> 01:06:27.221
But first,
let me give you some advice.

01:06:27.355 --> 01:06:31.058
I already gave this boy some advice.
You ready for yours?

01:06:34.628 --> 01:06:36.796
Ain't nobody
gonna rescue you.

01:06:38.498 --> 01:06:41.635
You gotta
rescue yourself.

01:06:55.548 --> 01:06:57.184
I think
she's a prophetess.

01:06:58.852 --> 01:06:59.886
A what?

01:07:01.688 --> 01:07:03.623
A prophetess.

01:07:05.059 --> 01:07:07.594
They're painted all over
the Sistine ceiling.

01:07:09.997 --> 01:07:12.599
They're women
who God speaks through.

01:07:13.267 --> 01:07:14.534
Hmm.

01:07:14.668 --> 01:07:17.604
Prophetess.
Makes sense.

01:07:28.548 --> 01:07:31.018
You out in the woods
with that girl again?

01:07:31.152 --> 01:07:32.619
Yes, sir.

01:07:34.221 --> 01:07:35.855
Look over here, Son.

01:07:38.692 --> 01:07:40.593
Where'd this meat
come from?

01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:44.631
Beauchamp.

01:07:45.665 --> 01:07:47.001
Beauchamp?

01:07:54.241 --> 01:07:55.675
Beauchamp?

01:08:00.613 --> 01:08:01.983
He hardly pay me enough
to get by,

01:08:02.116 --> 01:08:04.684
and now he's giving us
his rotten meat.

01:08:06.387 --> 01:08:12.093
He thinks I ain't man enough
to put meat on my own table?

01:08:16.796 --> 01:08:18.732
I'll teach him a lesson.

01:08:20.167 --> 01:08:21.335
I ought to.

01:08:22.769 --> 01:08:24.604
Making me work
for less than nothin'!

01:08:25.671 --> 01:08:27.174
Giving us rotten meat!

01:08:29.243 --> 01:08:30.844
Rotten meat!

01:08:31.979 --> 01:08:33.279
Damn him!

01:08:41.888 --> 01:08:44.191
Nice and hot,
just like you like it.

01:08:44.325 --> 01:08:45.926
Thank you, darling.

01:08:46.394 --> 01:08:47.861
What?

01:08:47.995 --> 01:08:49.562
It's chamomile.
It's your favorite.

01:08:49.696 --> 01:08:50.965
It's delicious, Robert.

01:08:51.098 --> 01:08:52.133
Mm-hmm.

01:08:53.033 --> 01:08:54.100
Then what?

01:08:55.301 --> 01:08:57.971
- I've got somethin' for you.
- No.

01:08:58.104 --> 01:09:01.509
Somethin' I made
especially for you.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.010
Wow.

01:09:07.613 --> 01:09:10.750
I still don't know how you do that.
That is beautiful.

01:09:10.884 --> 01:09:12.185
That's me,
and that's you.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.888
I can see that, thank you very much.

01:09:15.022 --> 01:09:16.057
I love it.

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:38.078
Daddy.

01:09:38.212 --> 01:09:39.578
No, no.

01:09:39.712 --> 01:09:41.182
Not right now.

01:10:35.503 --> 01:10:36.870
Look, Rob.

01:10:37.004 --> 01:10:40.474
I have never in my life seen
a prettier color of green.

01:10:40.608 --> 01:10:42.576
Ain't it perfect?

01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:43.743
Yes, ma'am.

01:10:43.877 --> 01:10:45.246
It looks like
the original green.

01:10:45.379 --> 01:10:47.314
The first one
that God ever thought up.

01:10:47.448 --> 01:10:48.848
That's right.

01:10:48.983 --> 01:10:51.118
The first-ever green.

01:10:51.252 --> 01:10:54.488
Or maybe he made that
special green just for you.

01:10:54.622 --> 01:10:56.090
- You think?
- Maybe.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.163
You and me,
we see the world the same.

01:11:05.765 --> 01:11:07.001
Mmm.

01:11:07.767 --> 01:11:09.802
What are y'all
talking about?

01:11:10.437 --> 01:11:11.505
Green.

01:11:11.639 --> 01:11:13.073
Oh.

01:12:38.325 --> 01:12:40.760
Yep. And then...

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:46.533
Hey.

01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:47.635
Hey.

01:12:47.767 --> 01:12:49.069
Where your lady friend at?

01:12:49.203 --> 01:12:52.606
School.
But today's only a half day.

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.974
Hmm.

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:03.284
Why you giving me them
shifty-eyed looks?

01:13:04.218 --> 01:13:07.288
Um, I made you something.

01:13:08.088 --> 01:13:10.691
You made me something?
For real?

01:13:10.823 --> 01:13:12.159
Mm-hmm.

01:13:12.293 --> 01:13:14.794
But you gotta put your hand out
and close your eyes.

01:13:14.928 --> 01:13:16.430
I ain't.

01:13:24.672 --> 01:13:26.240
You can look now.

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:32.479
I ain't gotta look.
I know what this is.

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.316
It's Cricket.

01:13:35.449 --> 01:13:39.386
But you gotta look at it and tell
me, did I do it right.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.723
I ain't gotta do nothing
but stay black and die.

01:13:42.855 --> 01:13:45.225
Come on, look at it.

01:13:50.331 --> 01:13:52.933
That's the bird.

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:58.072
That's the one.

01:13:58.205 --> 01:14:01.375
Now you don't have to dream
about him at night no more.

01:14:02.609 --> 01:14:04.211
That's right.

01:14:04.345 --> 01:14:07.915
Boy, who taught you how to work
a piece of wood like this?

01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:10.617
My mama.

01:14:11.485 --> 01:14:13.120
She taught you good.

01:14:13.886 --> 01:14:15.255
Yes, ma'am.

01:14:19.159 --> 01:14:22.062
I know a wooden bird ain't
the same as a real one.

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:24.897
Yeah, that's right,
but...

01:14:26.166 --> 01:14:29.136
...it soothes
my heart just the same.

01:14:33.107 --> 01:14:37.111
My dad says he ain't got no jobs
for me to do till this afternoon.

01:14:37.244 --> 01:14:40.247
He said I could help
you out in the morning.

01:14:40.381 --> 01:14:41.415
Well,

01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:46.220
I'm sure I can find something
for you to help me with.

01:14:48.789 --> 01:14:52.226
It's not my fault that you're
broke, damn idiot!

01:14:52.359 --> 01:14:55.996
You came to me,
and now you owe me big.

01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:57.364
Plus interest!

01:14:58.165 --> 01:14:59.899
You better put on
your thinking cap,

01:15:00.033 --> 01:15:01.635
or there's gonna be
consequences.

01:15:01.769 --> 01:15:02.970
All right.
All right.

01:15:03.103 --> 01:15:04.638
I'm dead serious.

01:15:17.818 --> 01:15:19.219
Hey.

01:15:20.354 --> 01:15:21.388
Where's the prophetess?

01:15:21.522 --> 01:15:23.957
- Huh?
- Willie May. Where is she?

01:15:24.091 --> 01:15:25.793
She's vacuuming.

01:15:25.926 --> 01:15:29.563
My mother found out I was
wearing your clothes to school.

01:15:29.696 --> 01:15:30.931
I'm in trouble.

01:15:31.064 --> 01:15:32.533
I'm not supposed
to come out here anymore.

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.902
You know, you don't always
have to get into fights.

01:15:35.035 --> 01:15:38.439
Sometimes if you don't hit them
back, they'll just leave you alone.

01:15:38.572 --> 01:15:42.376
I want to get in fights.
I want to hit them back.

01:15:42.509 --> 01:15:45.679
Sometimes I hit them first.
I don't even know why.

01:15:45.813 --> 01:15:47.681
Oh.

01:15:47.815 --> 01:15:51.452
I'm going to go ask the prophetess
what we should do with the tiger.

01:15:51.585 --> 01:15:53.620
No. You can't ask her
about the tiger.

01:15:53.754 --> 01:15:57.558
Beauchamp said I ain't supposed to
tell nobody, especially not Willie May.

01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:03.397
We need some answers.

01:16:04.631 --> 01:16:07.201
Well, look at you two.

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:10.971
What's
in your hand?

01:16:15.809 --> 01:16:17.578
Oh.

01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:19.480
Did Rob make it?

01:16:19.613 --> 01:16:21.048
He did.

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:26.587
It almost looks alive.

01:16:32.292 --> 01:16:34.161
Is it like your bird
that you let go?

01:16:34.294 --> 01:16:36.997
Just about exactly.

01:16:38.632 --> 01:16:39.867
I...

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.503
We need to ask you
something.

01:16:42.636 --> 01:16:43.938
Well, ask away.

01:16:44.071 --> 01:16:47.140
If you knew about something
that was locked up in a cage,

01:16:47.274 --> 01:16:51.812
something big and beautiful that was
locked away unfairly, for no good reason,

01:16:51.946 --> 01:16:53.514
and you had the keys
to the cage,

01:16:53.647 --> 01:16:54.781
would you let it go?

01:16:57.251 --> 01:17:00.454
Lord God. What you two kids
got locked up in a cage?

01:17:00.587 --> 01:17:01.688
It's a tiger.

01:17:01.822 --> 01:17:02.723
A what?

01:17:02.856 --> 01:17:03.958
A tiger.

01:17:04.091 --> 01:17:07.127
- Lord Jesus.
- It's true!

01:17:15.102 --> 01:17:16.336
All right.

01:17:17.972 --> 01:17:21.775
Why don't you two take me to where
you got this tiger locked in a cage.

01:17:29.216 --> 01:17:30.517
This way.

01:17:31.685 --> 01:17:34.221
All right. Now, slow down.
I'm coming.

01:17:34.354 --> 01:17:37.057
Give an old woman
a chance to catch up.

01:17:42.296 --> 01:17:45.165
Where are you two going?

01:17:45.299 --> 01:17:47.267
This ain't no place
for you two...

01:17:51.338 --> 01:17:54.575
Lord God almighty.

01:17:58.913 --> 01:18:01.315
Ain't no need to doubt
the fierceness of God

01:18:01.448 --> 01:18:03.717
when he can make
something like that.

01:18:08.655 --> 01:18:11.158
Who is the fool
that caged that tiger up?

01:18:11.291 --> 01:18:12.893
He belongs
to Beauchamp.

01:18:13.027 --> 01:18:14.963
Beauchamp?

01:18:15.095 --> 01:18:18.198
If there's one person in the world
don't need to be owning no tiger,

01:18:18.332 --> 01:18:19.800
that's Beauchamp.

01:18:19.934 --> 01:18:21.201
Damn fool.

01:18:21.335 --> 01:18:23.704
See?
It's not right, is it?

01:18:23.837 --> 01:18:25.872
Just like how you told Rob
about your bird

01:18:26.007 --> 01:18:27.174
and how you had
to let it go.

01:18:27.307 --> 01:18:29.010
A bird, that's one thing.

01:18:29.142 --> 01:18:31.913
Tiger belonging to Beauchamp,
that's a whole nother.

01:18:32.046 --> 01:18:35.549
Tell Rob that he should unlock
the cage and let him go!

01:18:35.682 --> 01:18:36.817
I ain't.

01:18:37.818 --> 01:18:40.420
What's this tiger supposed
to do once you let him go?

01:18:40.554 --> 01:18:41.956
How's it gonna live?

01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:43.958
Panthers live
in these woods.

01:18:44.092 --> 01:18:45.359
They survive.

01:18:45.492 --> 01:18:48.128
Used to.
Don't no more.

01:18:50.163 --> 01:18:51.732
You're not saying
what you believe.

01:18:51.865 --> 01:18:54.102
You're not talking
like a prophetess.

01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:56.070
That's because
I ain't no prophetess.

01:18:56.203 --> 01:18:58.138
I'm a person
speaking the truth.

01:18:58.271 --> 01:19:01.274
The truth is there ain't nothing you
could do for that tiger except let him be.

01:19:01.408 --> 01:19:02.643
But it's not right.

01:19:02.776 --> 01:19:04.511
That ain't got
nothing to do with it.

01:19:04.645 --> 01:19:06.279
Sometimes
right don't matter.

01:19:06.413 --> 01:19:09.117
I can't wait
until my father comes to get me.

01:19:09.249 --> 01:19:10.584
He knows what's right.

01:19:10.717 --> 01:19:13.153
He'll come out here
and set this tiger free.

01:19:14.254 --> 01:19:16.456
Your daddy ain't coming
to get you.

01:19:17.724 --> 01:19:20.128
My father is coming
to get me.

01:19:20.293 --> 01:19:22.596
No. He ain't.

01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:24.932
He's a liar,
like your mom said.

01:19:25.666 --> 01:19:28.936
You're the liar.
And I hate you.

01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:31.005
Everybody at school
hates you too.

01:19:31.139 --> 01:19:32.539
Even the teachers.

01:19:32.673 --> 01:19:36.944
And I hope I never,
ever see you again.

01:19:40.547 --> 01:19:42.215
She don't mean it.

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:46.887
She don't mean nothing she's
saying right now. Stop it.

01:19:48.288 --> 01:19:49.790
Listen to me.

01:19:50.657 --> 01:19:52.392
You think
I don't wanna see that tiger

01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:54.962
just rise on up
out of that cage?

01:19:56.296 --> 01:19:57.631
Yeah.

01:19:58.298 --> 01:19:59.733
Mm-hmm.

01:19:59.866 --> 01:20:02.703
I'd love to see that tiger
come right on up outta there

01:20:02.836 --> 01:20:04.671
and make a meal
out of Beauchamp.

01:20:04.805 --> 01:20:09.309
Serve him right for keeping a
wild animal locked up like that

01:20:09.443 --> 01:20:11.878
and putting you
in the middle of this.

01:20:13.114 --> 01:20:15.549
Giving you the keys
to the cage.

01:20:22.156 --> 01:20:23.390
Come on.

01:20:24.224 --> 01:20:26.460
Come on up
out of here.

01:21:10.904 --> 01:21:12.439
She's passed.

01:21:42.069 --> 01:21:43.603
Sistine!

01:21:43.737 --> 01:21:45.739
I got something
to tell you.

01:21:46.473 --> 01:21:48.408
I'm not talking to you.

01:21:48.542 --> 01:21:50.410
I come to tell you
about the tiger.

01:21:50.544 --> 01:21:52.246
What about him?

01:21:52.379 --> 01:21:54.447
I'm gonna let him go.

01:21:54.581 --> 01:21:56.583
You won't do it.

01:21:57.118 --> 01:21:58.986
Yes, I will.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.022
I'm gonna do it,
Sistine.

01:22:01.155 --> 01:22:03.623
I'm gonna do it
for you.

01:22:09.063 --> 01:22:10.363
Oh, no.

01:22:10.497 --> 01:22:12.133
Hey!

01:22:12.266 --> 01:22:14.334
Is that "Mr. Stupid"?

01:22:16.336 --> 01:22:18.906
You out
getting your exercise?

01:22:21.108 --> 01:22:22.375
Huh?

01:22:23.244 --> 01:22:24.278
Well, speak up, boy.

01:22:24.411 --> 01:22:25.779
Yes, sir.

01:22:28.582 --> 01:22:30.985
I know
what you've been doing.

01:22:31.118 --> 01:22:33.854
You out chasing the girls,
aren't you? Huh?

01:22:33.988 --> 01:22:37.424
He's a man after my own heart.
Hmm?

01:22:37.557 --> 01:22:39.060
This your girlfriend?

01:22:44.798 --> 01:22:46.000
No, sir.

01:22:50.403 --> 01:22:52.006
What's your name,
little thing?

01:22:53.174 --> 01:22:54.342
Sissy.

01:22:54.474 --> 01:22:57.677
Sissy.
That's really pretty.

01:22:58.745 --> 01:22:59.981
That's the kind of name

01:23:00.114 --> 01:23:01.916
that's worth running
down the road after.

01:23:02.049 --> 01:23:03.550
Isn't it? Huh?

01:23:04.384 --> 01:23:06.853
I got you
some more goods.

01:23:06.988 --> 01:23:09.190
I'm gonna leave them over
behind the office, all right?

01:23:09.323 --> 01:23:12.459
And remember to leave your
worthless daddy out of this, right?

01:23:12.592 --> 01:23:14.128
Yes, sir.

01:23:14.262 --> 01:23:16.763
Mm-hmm. Good.

01:23:16.897 --> 01:23:20.400
I've got some manly business
with your daddy over here, so...

01:23:21.601 --> 01:23:24.038
you two,
you stay out of trouble.

01:23:24.171 --> 01:23:25.872
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

01:23:26.007 --> 01:23:26.941
Okay?

01:23:27.074 --> 01:23:28.541
So nice to meet you.

01:23:28.675 --> 01:23:30.844
Nice to meet you too, Sissy.

01:23:35.649 --> 01:23:37.517
What a bozo.

01:23:37.651 --> 01:23:39.586
He may not be the
stupidest man in the world,

01:23:39.719 --> 01:23:41.488
but I'll bet
he's related.

01:23:44.457 --> 01:23:46.193
He's afraid, you know.

01:23:46.327 --> 01:23:47.661
He's afraid
of the tiger.

01:23:47.794 --> 01:23:50.197
That's why he's
making you feed him.

01:23:50.331 --> 01:23:52.432
Yeah. You're right.

01:23:55.468 --> 01:23:56.870
I'm sorry.

01:23:57.004 --> 01:23:58.906
What I said
about your daddy earlier.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.343
I don't want to talk about my father.
It doesn't matter.

01:24:02.475 --> 01:24:03.743
What matters
is the tiger.

01:24:03.877 --> 01:24:06.113
Come on.
Let's go set him free.

01:24:14.754 --> 01:24:16.523
Hurry!
Hurry up!

01:24:22.495 --> 01:24:25.632
Hurry.
Get the other lock!

01:24:32.106 --> 01:24:33.941
Now open the door.

01:24:37.979 --> 01:24:41.581
You know,
he ain't eaten nothing in two days.

01:24:41.715 --> 01:24:44.185
- I'll bet he's pretty hungry.
- So what?

01:24:44.318 --> 01:24:46.053
What if he eats us?

01:24:46.187 --> 01:24:48.888
He won't.
We're his emancipators.

01:24:50.992 --> 01:24:52.026
Okay.

01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:57.764
Get out of the way.

01:25:32.433 --> 01:25:33.733
Go on.

01:25:44.711 --> 01:25:46.579
You're free.

01:25:56.991 --> 01:25:58.125
Get out!

01:26:00.127 --> 01:26:01.895
Go on, get!

01:26:11.172 --> 01:26:12.772
Mmm.

01:26:15.009 --> 01:26:17.278
We see the world the same.

01:26:23.317 --> 01:26:25.119
She's passed.

01:26:32.659 --> 01:26:35.296
<i>Crying
ain't gonna bring her back.</i>

01:26:37.398 --> 01:26:38.832
Get out of the cage!

01:26:38.966 --> 01:26:41.469
Did you hear me?
Get out!

01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:43.204
Get out!

01:26:44.871 --> 01:26:48.976
Did you hear me? Get out!
Get out of the cage!

01:26:52.346 --> 01:26:53.680
Get out!

01:26:55.416 --> 01:26:58.085
He's leaving.
Watch.

01:28:27.707 --> 01:28:30.877
Go on! Be free.

01:28:37.318 --> 01:28:39.053
Oh, my.

01:28:51.831 --> 01:28:53.733
See?

01:28:54.635 --> 01:28:57.037
That was
the right thing to do.

01:29:07.147 --> 01:29:10.718
Yes. It was
the right thing to do.

01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:12.086
He's free! We did it!

01:29:12.219 --> 01:29:13.786
He's free!
We did it!

01:29:21.362 --> 01:29:22.396
Sistine!

01:29:23.464 --> 01:29:25.099
Sistine!

01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:30.903
Are you okay?

01:29:31.038 --> 01:29:34.975
I don't know.
Something took my breath away.

01:29:36.809 --> 01:29:38.245
Come on. Let's go.

01:29:49.789 --> 01:29:51.292
No!

01:29:58.666 --> 01:30:00.234
Dear Jesus.

01:30:12.579 --> 01:30:14.214
What did you do?

01:30:18.485 --> 01:30:19.987
<i>You're a liar.</i>

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.922
- Come on.
- You're a liar.

01:30:22.056 --> 01:30:24.024
You know I ain't lying.
I wasn't in there.

01:30:24.158 --> 01:30:26.093
- No, you are.
- You saw where it was.

01:30:26.226 --> 01:30:28.696
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Come on, Beauchamp.

01:30:28.861 --> 01:30:30.464
I ain't gonna touch you.

01:30:30.597 --> 01:30:31.831
Come on. Huh?

01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.634
Come on. Come on!

01:30:48.482 --> 01:30:49.917
No!

01:31:00.394 --> 01:31:02.596
No! No!

01:31:18.278 --> 01:31:20.180
What did you do?

01:31:26.854 --> 01:31:29.022
He was so beautiful.

01:31:30.991 --> 01:31:33.193
He was magnificent.

01:31:33.327 --> 01:31:37.164
He didn't deserve
to be locked up in a cage.

01:31:38.866 --> 01:31:41.168
He deserved to be free.

01:31:44.805 --> 01:31:46.607
What did you do?

01:31:47.508 --> 01:31:49.476
What'd you do?

01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:51.378
You killed him!

01:31:52.813 --> 01:31:56.617
- I had to.
- That was my tiger! You killed him!

01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:58.752
You killed my tiger!

01:31:59.153 --> 01:32:00.554
It was mine!

01:32:01.522 --> 01:32:04.625
I hate you!
You ain't the one I need!

01:32:04.758 --> 01:32:07.394
I need her! I need her!

01:32:08.495 --> 01:32:09.963
You say her name!

01:32:11.665 --> 01:32:13.000
Say it!

01:32:17.538 --> 01:32:19.373
Caroline.

01:32:22.609 --> 01:32:24.211
Caroline.

01:32:27.514 --> 01:32:29.082
Caroline.

01:32:35.489 --> 01:32:39.226
I need her.

01:32:41.094 --> 01:32:42.996
I need her too.

01:32:43.864 --> 01:32:45.466
But we don't got her.

01:32:46.867 --> 01:32:48.602
Neither one of us.

01:32:51.672 --> 01:32:54.274
Hey, listen.

01:32:54.408 --> 01:32:57.478
What we got, all we got

01:32:59.079 --> 01:33:00.915
is each other.

01:33:01.048 --> 01:33:03.584
Okay. We got to learn
to work with that.

01:33:04.985 --> 01:33:06.687
I ain't gonna cry.

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:09.256
That's all right, buddy.

01:33:09.389 --> 01:33:11.992
It's all right.
It's gonna be okay.

01:33:13.327 --> 01:33:16.296
You're gonna get through this.
We both will.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.243
You ain't gonna come pounding
on me now, is you?

01:33:29.776 --> 01:33:31.144
No, ma'am.

01:34:02.843 --> 01:34:04.211
Good shot.

01:34:22.262 --> 01:34:24.197
He's in heaven now.

01:34:24.933 --> 01:34:27.334
He'll be just fine.

01:34:49.890 --> 01:34:51.391
You all right?

01:34:53.193 --> 01:34:56.330
- He gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

01:35:01.936 --> 01:35:03.370
You were right.

01:35:05.672 --> 01:35:08.342
My father's not coming
to get me.

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.816
And it's okay.

01:35:16.951 --> 01:35:19.686
I didn't mean
what I said about you before,

01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:22.756
and I really,
really don't hate you.

01:35:22.889 --> 01:35:24.458
Not at all.

01:35:24.591 --> 01:35:26.426
You're my best friend.

01:35:28.895 --> 01:35:30.297
That's all right.

01:36:12.339 --> 01:36:13.740
Is this yours?

01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:19.346
It's beautiful.

01:36:28.056 --> 01:36:29.523
You can keep it.

01:36:31.425 --> 01:36:32.859
If you want.

01:36:43.537 --> 01:36:46.406
<i>For years,
I wondered if we did the right thing</i>

01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:48.842
<i>opening that cage.</i>

01:36:48.976 --> 01:36:50.877
<i>But I knew we had to.</i>

01:36:51.845 --> 01:36:54.314
<i>I can still hear
the sound of that gunshot</i>

01:36:54.448 --> 01:36:56.349
<i>like it was yesterday.</i>

01:36:56.483 --> 01:37:01.254
<i>I thought I would die of a broken
heart along with the tiger,</i>

01:37:01.388 --> 01:37:03.423
<i>but I didn't.</i>

01:37:03.557 --> 01:37:08.528
<i>In fact, that was the day I started
to look at life in a whole new way,</i>

01:37:09.529 --> 01:37:11.865
<i>grateful for the things
I had</i>

01:37:11.999 --> 01:37:15.002
<i>and at peace with
what would never come back.</i>

01:37:16.703 --> 01:37:19.873
<i>We were all freed
from our cages that day.</i>

01:37:20.007 --> 01:37:22.110
<i>We learned that there are
just some things</i>

01:37:22.242 --> 01:37:24.745
<i>that you can't keep
locked away forever...</i>

01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:28.983
<i>like memories</i>

01:37:29.117 --> 01:37:30.918
<i>and heartache</i>

01:37:31.052 --> 01:37:32.586
<i>and tigers.</i>
