ER

00:06.979 --> 00:08.248
Previously in ER...

00:08.249 --> 00:10.297
What's your son's name, Dr Benton?

00:10.298 --> 00:11.460
He doesn't have one.

00:11.461 --> 00:14.919
You get a full arrest you call an Attending!
You don't play the hero, you get help!

00:15.320 --> 00:17.067
- Let's have a beer.
- Ok.

00:17.068 --> 00:18.891
- Dr. Benton?
- Yeah?

00:18.992 --> 00:22.455
Elizabeth Corday. Visiting
surgical lecturer and your savior.

00:22.610 --> 00:26.028
Will you take Dr. Del Amico back?
I'm intimidated enough already.

00:26.029 --> 00:27.734
- Anna, please.
- All right, Anna.

00:27.735 --> 00:30.323
- If Dr. Minz calls, I'm on my way out.
- Okey-dokey.

00:30.717 --> 00:31.854
Good night.

00:31.855 --> 00:35.139
I have nothing to say. I agreed
to let you follow me on the job.

00:35.140 --> 00:36.140
We can do that,
but no more interviews.

WMAQ-670 news.

00:58.752 --> 01:01.161
Good morning, Chicago.
I'm Pat Cassidy.

01:01.381 --> 01:04.715
It's hot, too hot!
Temperature's expected to press 100-

01:09.059 --> 01:11.812
Son of a bitch!
What the hell do you think you' re doing?

01:12.022 --> 01:13.517
Dr. Greene?

01:14.192 --> 01:17.313
I'm sorry. I thought-
Don't stop. I'm okay.

01:17.530 --> 01:19.239
I'm not stopping. I'm parking.

01:19.492 --> 01:22.578
- On the street?
- I don't park in the garage anymore.

01:22.788 --> 01:25.078
The place gives me the creeps too.

01:25.292 --> 01:28.663
That's all right. That's not even a dent.
Nice car. Good color.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.634
- You should use the crosswalk, Carter.
- Right.

01:31.844 --> 01:33.043
You're in early.

01:33.263 --> 01:36.681
- Wanted to be in before my med student.
- Your very own scut puppy.

01:36.852 --> 01:40.353
Somebody to pick up my labs,
do a patient history...

01:40.524 --> 01:42.316
...the occasional obligatory
rectal exam.

01:42.485 --> 01:43.517
Someone to abuse.

01:43.695 --> 01:46.104
No, this is completely about teaching.

01:46.324 --> 01:47.736
The way Benton taught you?

01:47.952 --> 01:49.067
Or even better.

01:49.287 --> 01:52.575
- dread to parents of children
who will get sick this school year.

01:52.793 --> 01:55.166
And with more than 100 viruses
floating around...

01:55.380 --> 01:56.460
Hello?

01:56.674 --> 01:57.872
Dr. Morgenstern?

01:58.051 --> 02:00.128
Here. Come here, you.

02:01.723 --> 02:02.969
David.

02:04.143 --> 02:06.896
Little guy has a tendency
to get away from you.

02:07.064 --> 02:08.096
Here, let me.

02:08.316 --> 02:09.479
There you go.

02:11.321 --> 02:12.732
Kerry Weaver...

02:13.407 --> 02:14.867
...Katie Couric.

02:15.077 --> 02:17.403
Katie Couric, Kerry Weaver.

02:18.707 --> 02:20.582
So, David, how are you feeling?

02:20.961 --> 02:21.992
Morphine.

02:22.213 --> 02:23.791
Damn fine stuff.

02:24.007 --> 02:27.128
I talked to Dr. Weintraub.
They're tapering your lidocaine.

02:27.345 --> 02:30.431
The echo showed very little damage
to your myocardium.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.091
I put...

02:32.311 --> 02:34.186
...the nitropatch here.

02:34.398 --> 02:36.142
Just as effective.

02:36.359 --> 02:39.030
Most docs put it
on the patient's chest.

02:39.239 --> 02:42.775
I say, why tear out those
little hairs if you don't have to?

02:44.622 --> 02:46.781
I have some forms...

02:46.959 --> 02:49.368
...that Billing sent down
for you to sign.

02:49.588 --> 02:53.338
The CPT codes for the attendings
from last month.

02:53.552 --> 02:55.510
They're always sending me this junk.

02:55.722 --> 02:58.760
Forms, paperwork, duplicates...

02:58.977 --> 03:01.552
...little perforated lines.

03:01.773 --> 03:02.936
"Tear here. "

03:03.150 --> 03:05.144
They must not know
about your heart attack.

03:05.362 --> 03:07.320
If you want to look them over-

03:07.490 --> 03:10.991
I never look them over.
Sign them for me and send them back.

03:11.663 --> 03:14.202
- You want me to sign them?
- Sign everything.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.458
Send everything back.

03:16.671 --> 03:20.671
- You don't mind if I take over a little bit?
- Praise Allah, no!

03:21.094 --> 03:22.375
I don't mind telling you...

03:22.596 --> 03:25.682
...sometimes I have felt
like a sheriff with no posse.

03:26.144 --> 03:28.351
Like a general with no...

03:28.522 --> 03:29.851
...grunts in the field.

03:30.525 --> 03:32.234
Like a lone shepherd...

03:32.445 --> 03:34.273
...high up on a hill...

03:34.490 --> 03:36.115
...no sheep dog.

03:37.077 --> 03:39.866
I completely understand how you feel.
I'd like to take-

03:40.082 --> 03:43.618
Everywhere you look
there's sheep, sheep, sheep.

03:44.881 --> 03:48.002
Maybe it would be best if I stepped in
and took over some...

03:48.219 --> 03:50.711
...administrative duties
while you're recuperating.

03:53.310 --> 03:55.518
God bless you, Kerry Weaver.

03:55.730 --> 03:57.225
God bless you.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.199
Doug?

04:10.879 --> 04:13.335
Ketchup or Tabasco?

04:14.050 --> 04:17.468
With your scrambled eggs.
You want what some call a vegetable...

04:17.680 --> 04:19.341
...or something more daring?

04:19.559 --> 04:20.970
- You thought I left.
- No.

04:21.185 --> 04:23.227
- Yes, you did.
- No, really. I didn't.

04:23.439 --> 04:26.442
Okay, yeah, I did. But you kind of
did leave, technically.

04:26.611 --> 04:28.106
That doesn't count.

04:28.322 --> 04:32.452
If you'd gotten up a bit earlier, you
would've seen me here, sound asleep.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.697
Well, some habits die hard.

04:34.915 --> 04:36.956
Yeah, like you sleeping in.

04:37.711 --> 04:41.378
- Like you not being there in the morning.
- That's an old habit.

04:44.346 --> 04:45.378
Thank you.

04:45.974 --> 04:48.466
Okay. I gotta talk to you
about something.

04:49.145 --> 04:52.848
- Not another serious conversation.
- You said we didn't communicate.

04:53.068 --> 04:55.821
- Now you're communicating too much.
- It's important.

04:55.989 --> 04:58.363
- Can I have a drawer?
- What?

04:58.535 --> 05:00.659
A drawer. Something you keep
your clothes in.

05:00.830 --> 05:03.322
Something that I would keep
my clothes in.

05:04.669 --> 05:06.663
- You never wanted a drawer before.
- Well...

05:09.343 --> 05:12.096
...that's because I always
got up and left.

05:12.306 --> 05:14.513
But now that I'm staying here...

05:17.146 --> 05:18.855
If I could maybe just have...

05:19.692 --> 05:21.317
...some place to...

05:22.697 --> 05:23.776
...keep a new shirt...

05:24.032 --> 05:26.821
- Yeah.
- ... or a nice pair of socks.

05:29.248 --> 05:31.076
I'd settle for underwear.

05:33.672 --> 05:37.624
You know, you could always just wash
your boxers out in the sink.

05:37.845 --> 05:39.885
They'd dry by the morning.

05:43.937 --> 05:45.397
Oh, my!

06:38.224 --> 06:41.509
- So Morgenstern asked you to stop by?
- I had forms for him to sign.

06:41.686 --> 06:45.303
Next thing you know he makes me
Acting Chief of Emergency Services...

06:45.480 --> 06:46.678
...while he recuperates.

06:46.856 --> 06:49.607
He's been under a lot more stress
than any of us realized.

06:49.817 --> 06:53.435
Can I give Mrs. Crane another 50
of Demerol? She's agitated.

06:53.654 --> 06:56.441
- Yes, I know. And yes, you can.
- Convention?

06:56.657 --> 06:59.230
Tour bus.
They're waiting for their driver.

06:59.451 --> 07:01.159
He ate bad eggs at Pulaski's...

07:01.368 --> 07:04.369
...and now he's puking up his guts
in Exam Room 4.

07:04.580 --> 07:07.450
Maybe we should talk
to Morgenstern's doctor. Who is it?

07:07.666 --> 07:10.417
Emma Weintraub.
I already talked to her.

07:10.585 --> 07:14.119
No PVCs, but chest pain.
They've scheduled angioplasty.

07:14.338 --> 07:15.998
So you'll be filling in?

07:16.214 --> 07:19.500
He asked me to fill in with some
administrative duties.

07:19.718 --> 07:23.418
- As long as you don't have a problem.
- Only if I had to do it.

07:23.596 --> 07:24.877
- Excellent.
- Morning.

07:25.097 --> 07:26.591
- Convention?
- Tour bus.

07:26.765 --> 07:28.592
- No kids, I hope.
- It's your lucky day.

07:28.809 --> 07:31.809
Jerry, pull the QA and Ql data
for the past three months.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.182
- You're kidding.
- Now!

07:33.396 --> 07:34.594
- Morning.
- Morning, Carol.

07:34.772 --> 07:37.097
- Sleep well?
- I did, yes. Thank you, Doug.

07:37.274 --> 07:38.602
- Tour bus?
- Bingo!

07:38.775 --> 07:43.484
I need to attend the executive committee
meeting for JCAHO's next visit.

07:43.697 --> 07:47.361
And I wanted to know if you and Carol
could interview the candidates...

07:47.575 --> 07:49.282
...for the new
desk-clerk position.

07:49.493 --> 07:51.237
- Around noon.
- It'd be a pleasure.

07:51.454 --> 07:55.450
Great. Just clear your selection
through me before you make a final one.

07:55.624 --> 07:57.948
- Jerry, you going somewhere?
- Not that I know of.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.667
- Dr. Mark Greene?
- Yeah?

07:59.877 --> 08:02.628
- This is for you.
- Wait a minute. Who are you?

08:02.838 --> 08:06.704
There's a name of an attorney inside
if you want to call for information.

08:06.925 --> 08:08.917
What is this? A subpoena?

08:11.679 --> 08:13.089
Oh, man.

08:13.764 --> 08:16.136
You're coming in to the clinic
at 4, right?

08:16.558 --> 08:17.886
Al!

08:18.393 --> 08:20.884
Yeah, don't worry. I'll be there.

08:21.062 --> 08:24.182
As long as I can come up with another
excuse to leave work early.

08:24.399 --> 08:26.307
I wish you could tell Rozwell the truth.

08:26.525 --> 08:28.149
That I have AIDS?

08:28.360 --> 08:31.313
- It'd take him five seconds to fire me.
- Okay.

08:31.488 --> 08:34.322
How about you have to pick your mother
up from the airport?

08:34.532 --> 08:35.907
I've used that one.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.611
One of our kids is sick?

08:37.784 --> 08:42.114
All four have already had every
childhood disease known to man.

08:42.288 --> 08:45.621
Your grandmother is sick,
and you have to see how she's doing?

08:45.833 --> 08:49.582
Poor Grandma had a stroke.
Went to her funeral last month.

08:49.794 --> 08:52.629
- That's horrible.
- I know, but it worked.

08:52.797 --> 08:55.797
Got me the afternoon off.
I'd better get going.

08:55.966 --> 08:57.959
Just make sure you get
this afternoon off.

08:58.135 --> 09:00.293
Miss an appointment,
you could lose your meds.

09:00.470 --> 09:03.804
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.
- "Yeah, yeah. Okay. " Okay?

09:04.308 --> 09:05.636
Don't worry.

09:06.392 --> 09:08.301
He's ready to come off the vent.

09:08.519 --> 09:11.805
- You want to extubate him today?
- It's been three weeks.

09:12.022 --> 09:14.691
- I think he's ready.
- What about a trial of CPAP?

09:14.899 --> 09:17.022
He's almost at room air. Setting at 99.

09:17.235 --> 09:21.528
- He says that's good.
- I know it's good, Carla, but...

09:21.739 --> 09:24.443
...he could end up
back on a ventilator.

09:24.658 --> 09:26.449
That's very unlikely.

09:26.744 --> 09:28.616
I'll extubate him this afternoon.

09:30.705 --> 09:32.163
What's wrong with you, Peter?

09:32.331 --> 09:35.830
- Why are you so against good news?
- Carla, I just want to be sure.

09:36.460 --> 09:40.042
You don't want to give him a name,
fix the birth certificate...

09:40.505 --> 09:45.047
- It's gonna be Baby Boy Reece forever?
- We weren't even sure he'd make it.

09:45.259 --> 09:47.050
But now we are.

09:47.261 --> 09:49.169
The next ultrasound
could show bleeding.

09:49.345 --> 09:52.180
And the sky could be falling too, Peter.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.181
We need to get on with his life.

10:00.314 --> 10:02.555
First thing I'm doing
is taking down those bunks.

10:02.774 --> 10:05.099
Don't you even think about
arguing with me.

10:05.318 --> 10:07.891
He's too smart for that,
aren't you, Skylar?

10:08.070 --> 10:11.071
It was my husband's idea.
He had bunks when he was a boy.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.445
Seven brothers. We had bunks all over.

10:13.658 --> 10:16.992
- You never fell out?
- No. I was pushed a number of times.

10:17.203 --> 10:18.994
Anna, you got a minute?

10:19.413 --> 10:22.579
The nurse will be in with your
Ortho referral, Mrs. McClay.

10:22.749 --> 10:25.584
And, Skylar, take the bottom bunk
for a while, okay?

10:25.752 --> 10:26.783
Thank you.

10:26.961 --> 10:28.123
Today's charts-

10:28.296 --> 10:31.711
With patients, I'd appreciate
if you called me Dr. Del Amico.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.257
- I didn't?
- Nope, you called me Anna.

10:34.468 --> 10:38.334
I didn't mean anything. I've probably
called Mark Greene "Mark"-

10:38.554 --> 10:40.464
- That would be wrong too.
- I'm sorry.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.508
It's okay. What about the charts?

10:42.724 --> 10:45.974
You've worked mostly Pedes
since you started? Hang on.

10:46.186 --> 10:49.555
Did you disagree with my handling
of any of those cases?

10:50.314 --> 10:52.354
You want to talk someplace else?

10:52.567 --> 10:53.811
No.

10:55.235 --> 10:58.022
- It's easier to go with what we know.
- Right.

10:58.238 --> 11:02.401
You've done a Pedes residency but
are here on an Emergency residency.

11:02.617 --> 11:05.190
I think you'd benefit
by working with adults.

11:05.411 --> 11:06.905
I appreciate your concern...

11:07.079 --> 11:09.450
...but I think
I can balance my own caseload.

11:09.664 --> 11:11.039
Well, I don't know-

11:11.249 --> 11:15.116
- Anna, the scut puppies have landed.
- You're not supervising my residency.

11:15.336 --> 11:17.245
- Pediatrics, I am.
- Okay.

11:17.463 --> 11:22.255
Adults you run by Dr. Doyle first,
then myself or Dr. Weaver. Okay?

11:22.426 --> 11:23.456
You too, Carter.

11:23.677 --> 11:26.463
- What? Run my cases by Maggie?
- That's right.

11:26.679 --> 11:30.972
I've done quite a few more
ER procedures than she has.

11:31.183 --> 11:32.992
And you are what year?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.800
Technically, an intern, first year.

11:35.019 --> 11:39.348
And she's second year. But I spent
half my internship teaching her.

11:39.565 --> 11:42.138
- No, you didn't.
- I taught you one-handed knots.

11:42.359 --> 11:44.067
- Big deal!
- Look, that's enough.

11:44.277 --> 11:48.108
Is everybody clear about
who runs what by whom?

11:48.614 --> 11:49.812
Yeah?

11:50.949 --> 11:53.488
- Where are the students?
- Cafeteria.

11:55.620 --> 11:56.865
Doug?

11:57.831 --> 12:01.364
Anna was gonna take
these barfing twins in 5.

12:04.377 --> 12:07.295
- Peter, you've met Elizabeth Corday?
- Yes. We've met.

12:07.505 --> 12:08.916
Yeah, hi.

12:09.132 --> 12:11.540
Would you assist her today?
Show her the ropes.

12:11.759 --> 12:13.965
- I don't know my surgical schedule.
- Just in Trauma.

12:14.178 --> 12:17.214
- Penetrating trauma, gunshot wounds.
- Yeah, sure. No problem.

12:17.431 --> 12:21.131
I was to tag along with Mr. Campbell,
but he's got a kidney stone.

12:21.309 --> 12:24.594
And seeing as Dr. Carter isn't
taking up your time-

12:24.812 --> 12:27.100
No, no problem.
This is the ER right now, so...

12:27.314 --> 12:29.058
Oh, lovely. Good.

12:37.406 --> 12:38.604
Which one do you want?

12:38.824 --> 12:42.524
I don't want either. I had plenty of
students back at CHOP. You choose.

12:42.744 --> 12:45.662
Let's just go along gender lines.
I'll take the guy.

12:46.289 --> 12:48.531
Hi, I'm John Carter.
This is Anna Del Amico.

12:48.749 --> 12:49.864
Hi, Chasity Lee.

12:50.084 --> 12:53.001
- Chastity?
- That would be as in Bono.

12:53.211 --> 12:54.788
No middle T. Just Chasity.

12:55.004 --> 12:56.546
And I'm George Henry.

12:56.756 --> 12:58.380
Okay. You'll be with me.

12:58.591 --> 13:02.920
Looking forward to finally doing my ER
rotation. My dad's a trauma surgeon.

13:03.137 --> 13:06.920
I know there's a lot of scut work,
but I'm glad to finally be seeing patients.

13:08.057 --> 13:11.260
John, I should mention that
I'm not all that interested...

13:11.477 --> 13:13.019
...in working with patients.

13:16.022 --> 13:17.101
Excuse me?

13:17.524 --> 13:18.899
I'm getting my MD/Ph. D.

13:19.108 --> 13:23.319
I finished med school. I've been doing
bench research for the past four years.

13:23.654 --> 13:26.323
Patients just aren't all that helpful
to my research.

13:26.531 --> 13:29.615
You haven't had any medical training
in four years?

13:29.826 --> 13:33.443
You remember anything?
About the pathophysiology of disease?

13:33.662 --> 13:35.785
- How to do a physical exam?
- No, not really.

13:35.998 --> 13:37.540
I've been doing brain research.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.996
Studying genetic markers
for Angelman's Syndrome.

13:42.045 --> 13:44.167
You may know it as
"happy puppet's disease. "

13:44.380 --> 13:47.381
It causes the afflicted
to laugh inappropriately and to...

13:47.967 --> 13:50.504
...flap their hands like a puppet...

13:51.011 --> 13:53.217
...on a string.

13:53.722 --> 13:55.216
Get X-ray in here!

13:55.390 --> 13:56.800
Please, it hurts!

13:57.016 --> 13:59.768
- Caught a good one, didn't you, Ernesto?
- Oh, man!

13:59.977 --> 14:02.598
This is Elizabeth Corday,
new surgical resident.

14:02.813 --> 14:04.935
- It's a pleasure.
- People, what do we have?

14:05.690 --> 14:08.810
GSW to the right chest.
Sixth intercostal space.

14:09.026 --> 14:12.359
Got two liters of saline
in the field. BP's 100/60.

14:12.571 --> 14:15.571
He's tachy at 120.
Pulse ox 95 on 10 liters.

14:15.740 --> 14:19.523
This is her first gunshot trauma.
Let's run it by the numbers.

14:19.743 --> 14:22.863
- I'm Miss Corday. And you are...?
- Ernesto Ruiz.

14:23.080 --> 14:27.077
- You have a nasty hole near your nipple.
- Somebody call my mom, please!

14:27.250 --> 14:30.001
You can tell her yourself
what you've been doing.

14:30.211 --> 14:33.911
Primary survey. Assess the airway
and the respiratory effort.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.758
No sign of tension pneumo
or cardiac tamponade.

14:36.967 --> 14:39.208
Next, auscultation
of the heart and lungs...

14:39.385 --> 14:41.129
...while palpating the carotid pulse.

14:41.346 --> 14:44.844
- Do you know what sort of bullet hit you?
- Who is this?

14:45.057 --> 14:48.924
Palpable carotid indicates a systolic
BP of 60. No muffled heart sounds.

14:49.102 --> 14:51.474
Diminished breath sounds.
He needs a chest tube.

14:51.688 --> 14:53.182
32 French. Let's move.

14:53.398 --> 14:54.940
-9 mm.
- I beg your pardon?

14:55.107 --> 14:57.729
- Possibly shot with a 9 mm.
- One of the semiautomatics?

14:57.943 --> 15:00.943
Right. Entry wound is typical,
but the exit...

15:01.112 --> 15:03.520
...is bigger.
The bullet yaws through 90 degrees.

15:03.740 --> 15:06.942
- Cavity's larger than a. 38 special.
- Is that temporary cavitation?

15:07.117 --> 15:09.443
Oh, God, no!
You need an AK-47 for that.

15:09.620 --> 15:12.739
9 mm's low velocity.
Only 1200 feet per second.

15:18.461 --> 15:20.702
Listen, when we get in there,
just stand back.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.337
- Observe. Don't do anything.
- I don't know how to do anything.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.580
So you've said.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.467
Why are we here?
They didn't page us.

15:27.676 --> 15:31.211
Henry, when you hear there's a good
case, you show up. Try to help.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.003
They always let you stay.
Just follow my lead, okay?

15:34.224 --> 15:37.011
- Horizontal mattress with 0-silk.
- Xeroform here.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.018
The velocity of a. 45 automatic?

15:39.229 --> 15:42.099
About 900 feet per second.
Doesn't deform or yaw.

15:42.315 --> 15:45.932
- How do you do? I'm Miss Corday.
- How do you do? I'm John Carter.

15:46.151 --> 15:48.309
This is my student, George Henry.

15:48.820 --> 15:50.148
What have we got?

15:50.613 --> 15:52.984
I can see we just put in a chest tube.

15:53.157 --> 15:55.529
Probably a hemopneumothorax.

15:55.743 --> 15:58.150
- What are you doing here?
- Just wanted to help out.

15:59.162 --> 16:02.910
Less than 500 cc's of blood. Means they
won't have to do an exploratory...

16:03.124 --> 16:04.535
- Move.
- ... thoracotomy.

16:04.751 --> 16:06.327
- Don't need you.
- Didn't page you.

16:06.501 --> 16:09.171
- If there's something you do need-
- No, there isn't.

16:09.379 --> 16:11.418
Look around. There are four doctors here.

16:11.631 --> 16:13.671
- Yeah, I realize that-
- I think we got it.

16:13.841 --> 16:15.251
Check with Dr. Greene.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.208
Right.

16:20.848 --> 16:24.096
Okay. Henry, I think Dr. Greene
probably needs us.

16:24.308 --> 16:25.802
Ma'am, let me have your feet.

16:26.018 --> 16:29.636
- How much did you drink, Ethyl?
- I don't drink.

16:29.855 --> 16:32.524
- I had a good job...
- Right.

16:32.691 --> 16:36.023
- Good timing, Carter. Who's this?
- Mr. Henry, my med student.

16:36.235 --> 16:38.192
You get to start with a good one, Henry.

16:38.404 --> 16:41.191
Cops dropped off Ethyl Hayes,
found down in the park...

16:41.365 --> 16:43.440
...but she didn't have a drop to drink.

16:43.742 --> 16:45.200
Have you, Ethyl?

16:45.410 --> 16:47.201
I don't drink!

16:47.412 --> 16:48.740
Henry, teaching point.

16:48.955 --> 16:51.825
Looks like a drunk,
smells like a drunk, she is a drunk.

16:52.041 --> 16:55.041
Connie, get a CBC, chem 7,
blood-alcohol level...

16:55.252 --> 16:56.532
...and a tox screen.

16:56.712 --> 16:58.787
- What do you want us to do?
- Carter?

16:59.214 --> 17:02.214
Hydrate with a banana bag, folate,
mag sulfate and thiamine.

17:02.383 --> 17:04.589
And 50 of Librium for impending DTs.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.880
Right.

17:06.051 --> 17:07.546
And Carter, she's febrile.

17:07.721 --> 17:10.721
So a gram of Tylenol rectally.

17:12.141 --> 17:13.683
Rec- Rectally?

17:13.851 --> 17:14.882
You heard him.

17:16.728 --> 17:18.222
Glove up and dig in.

17:24.068 --> 17:26.938
- Why is it so hot in here?
- Because it's so hot outside.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.772
Isn't the air conditioning working?

17:28.947 --> 17:32.281
Think you're hot? Those new candidates
are sweating like piggies.

17:32.491 --> 17:35.362
- Only two left?
- Not counting the one they're with now.

17:35.577 --> 17:37.570
- How were the others?
- Not a big hit.

17:37.788 --> 17:41.370
Yeah, well, I didn't put my money on you
when you were interviewing.

17:41.583 --> 17:43.077
- You bet on us?
- Sure.

17:43.293 --> 17:45.119
- But you didn't bet on me?
- Nope.

17:45.878 --> 17:50.623
Mrs. Styman, you've worked at several
other Chicago-area hospitals.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.628
Nine other hospitals.

17:52.801 --> 17:54.426
If that's what it says.

17:54.636 --> 17:56.877
Why'd you move around so much?
Just curious.

17:57.096 --> 18:00.382
- Did you ask them why?
- No, we just received your résumé now.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.176
Precision. That's why.

18:02.392 --> 18:05.179
- Their extraordinary lack of precision.
- Precision?

18:05.395 --> 18:08.846
For example, this interview
was scheduled for 12: 15.

18:09.065 --> 18:10.974
I arrived promptly at 12: 10.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.894
However, the interview
didn't actually start until 12:26.

18:15.446 --> 18:17.603
Eleven minutes late. Very imprecise.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.564
Well, we've been a little backed up.

18:20.783 --> 18:22.028
I thought so.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.815
Next question.

18:24.245 --> 18:26.071
Estelle Webb, 79.

18:26.288 --> 18:28.908
- Fell down her stairs.
- I didn't fall down.

18:29.123 --> 18:30.203
Please, help me.

18:30.416 --> 18:32.824
- What's open?
- Not much. Try Curtain 2.

18:33.044 --> 18:37.586
- Don't worry. We'll take care of you.
- Oh, thank you, dear. Thank you.

18:37.797 --> 18:42.044
Vitals are stable. BP's 130/70.
Pulse 88, regular. Resps 16.

18:42.259 --> 18:44.667
- Nice and easy.
- Oh, please, don't!

18:45.179 --> 18:47.052
- It hurts!
- Where does it hurt?

18:47.264 --> 18:48.758
Don't let her do it again.

18:48.974 --> 18:50.349
- See you later.
- Thanks.

18:50.559 --> 18:52.053
Please don't let who do what?

18:52.269 --> 18:54.841
My sister.
She pushed me down the stairs.

18:55.230 --> 18:58.147
You just rest.
We'll check everything out, okay?

18:59.316 --> 19:00.691
Dr. Corday.

19:00.901 --> 19:02.276
Dr. Benton.

19:02.486 --> 19:05.154
We'll be operating today
with Dr. Sam Breedlove.

19:05.363 --> 19:08.399
Breedlove? Invented the
Breedlove retractor, 1948?

19:08.616 --> 19:11.984
- And he's getting on in years.
- Quite ancient by now, I should think.

19:12.202 --> 19:14.871
- So I'll do most of the teaching.
- Really?

19:15.622 --> 19:19.321
You might wanna pay more attention here
than you did in the trauma room.

19:19.541 --> 19:22.328
I'll certainly bear that in mind,
Dr. Benton.

19:22.544 --> 19:25.379
- Sam Breedlove.
- Elizabeth Corday. How do you do?

19:25.547 --> 19:28.962
- Come again?
- I said, Elizabeth Corday!

19:29.175 --> 19:31.582
I knew he was old,
but not that he was short.

19:31.802 --> 19:34.209
- What did you say?
- I said I knew you were old...

19:34.387 --> 19:38.883
- ... but I didn't know you were so short.
- Yes, yes. Always have been.

19:43.021 --> 19:44.301
Salmon sperm, you say?

19:44.522 --> 19:47.357
Yes, it's what I use in my research
as a carrier.

19:47.565 --> 19:50.235
Obviously because it's
so easy to collect.

19:50.444 --> 19:51.558
Obviously.

19:51.778 --> 19:54.613
- Is your student hell as special as mine?
- What?

19:54.822 --> 19:57.988
I drew blood of the guy in 4.
I'll take these samples to the lab.

19:58.199 --> 20:00.073
- Great.
- I guess not.

20:00.243 --> 20:04.655
I've got an LOL in Curtain 2. Claims
her sister pushed her down the stairs.

20:04.831 --> 20:07.202
I want to get a social worker.
She needs an H and P.

20:07.416 --> 20:08.530
Meet my student, Henry.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.751
- No, I'm really not very capable.
- Take her history.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.832
She doesn't have any
orifice-type needs, does she?

20:15.048 --> 20:18.297
- The labs on the park lady are back.
- Thanks.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.793
There's puking in the air today.
I'm on my third scrub top.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.636
Need to move some patients here.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.758
Seventy-year-old ALOC.
Seven-year-old in respiratory distress.

20:26.933 --> 20:28.842
- What do you want?
- I'll take the 70.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.258
I'll take the 7.

20:32.771 --> 20:35.475
We don't need your résumé.
We've got your application.

20:35.690 --> 20:37.101
I know I have it. I just...

20:37.984 --> 20:39.443
I know I do.

20:40.778 --> 20:42.438
If you want, you can bring it back.

20:42.696 --> 20:45.780
No, I know what that means.
I'd like to interview now.

20:46.867 --> 20:50.235
My name is Cynthia Hooper,
and I'm originally from Joliet.

20:50.453 --> 20:53.453
My whole family's there,
but my parents have both passed on.

20:53.622 --> 20:56.576
- So you have brothers and sisters.
- No, I don't have any.

21:01.170 --> 21:04.005
Why don't you tell us
about your job experience.

21:05.507 --> 21:09.635
I mean something that might apply
to the job here.

21:11.805 --> 21:13.548
I've always been good with people.

21:13.764 --> 21:15.555
Everyone's always said that about me.

21:15.766 --> 21:19.349
When I was the cashier at the Ford
dealership, service and parts...

21:19.562 --> 21:23.179
...I used to talk to all the customers
while I was processing their bills.

21:23.398 --> 21:26.564
Is that what I'd be doing here,
handling the bills?

21:26.985 --> 21:28.976
We have a separate
department for that.

21:30.278 --> 21:31.523
Okay.

21:32.239 --> 21:33.269
I have other skills.

21:33.489 --> 21:36.905
- Telemarketing?
- I sold vitamins over the phone.

21:38.035 --> 21:40.158
That's kind of
in the health field, isn't it?

21:43.665 --> 21:45.491
No, I guess it's not really, is it?

21:48.795 --> 21:51.499
They didn't even like me there.

21:52.173 --> 21:54.841
Well, I got fired
because I wouldn't sell the...

21:55.050 --> 21:58.667
...combo Vitapack to the old people
that we were supposed to call.

22:00.930 --> 22:04.630
They didn't need vitamins. I mean,
it was just too late for them.

22:17.819 --> 22:19.194
How long has he been coughing?

22:19.863 --> 22:21.487
Just a slight fever, 100.3.

22:21.698 --> 22:24.615
- We need a translator in here.
- I've called twice.

22:24.867 --> 22:27.618
Probably bronchitis,
but it might be pneumonia.

22:27.828 --> 22:29.736
Get a CBC and a chest film.

22:29.913 --> 22:30.943
How long?

22:37.295 --> 22:40.166
Has he had his shots? Shot...

22:55.494 --> 22:57.322
We need a translator.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.349
The second guy wasn't so bad.

23:00.565 --> 23:04.312
Except he lied about his age,
previous job experience and high school.

23:04.526 --> 23:05.605
He can do the job.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.772
We need to see more people.
None we've seen seem to fit in.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.945
All they have to do is answer phones-

23:11.156 --> 23:12.947
It's more complicated than that.

23:13.158 --> 23:14.569
Mark?

23:14.743 --> 23:15.941
- Heather.
- Hi.

23:16.161 --> 23:19.411
- Another water-polo accident?
- Yeah, it's just a bad sprain.

23:19.622 --> 23:23.073
Looks like we're twins. Let me guess.
Racquetball? Rollerblading?

23:23.250 --> 23:25.706
- You should've asked for me.
- I thought about it.

23:25.919 --> 23:27.627
I have occasionally missed you.

23:27.837 --> 23:31.705
- So how's your busy social calendar?
- Well, it's not as busy anymore.

23:31.924 --> 23:34.249
- Yeah? Mine too.
- Should I just go on?

23:34.468 --> 23:37.883
- I can see you're busy now.
- Well, I'm busy with patients.

23:38.096 --> 23:40.254
- I'll see you.
- Fine. Great.

23:40.890 --> 23:42.432
So who's my patient?

23:42.642 --> 23:44.515
Laura Quentin.
Fainted at the car wash.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.763
- Dr. Greene?
- Just a minute, Carter.

23:48.188 --> 23:50.679
Hi, I'm Dr. Greene. You fainted?

23:50.899 --> 23:53.436
Yeah. I think it was probably
just the heat.

23:53.860 --> 23:57.442
- Has it happened to you before?
- No, never.

23:57.738 --> 23:59.980
You don't have to call my parents,
do you?

24:00.198 --> 24:01.692
- How old are you?
- I'm 18.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.948
No, we don't have to
call your parents.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.820
But we do have to run a few tests.

24:06.036 --> 24:07.152
Okay.

24:07.372 --> 24:08.948
Dr. Greene...

24:09.122 --> 24:10.154
...Ethyl Hayes is-

24:10.374 --> 24:12.366
Get a CBC, chem 20...

24:12.584 --> 24:14.624
...serum glucose, orthostatics...

24:14.836 --> 24:16.875
...and a pregnancy test, okay?

24:17.338 --> 24:18.797
Ethyl Hayes' labs are back.

24:19.006 --> 24:22.339
Tox screen was negative.
Blood-alcohol level was low, 0.5.

24:22.551 --> 24:23.879
Let her sleep it off.

24:24.052 --> 24:26.886
She's still slurring,
especially for that low of a BA level.

24:27.054 --> 24:28.632
Maybe she wants a free meal.

24:28.806 --> 24:31.807
- I'd like to run more tests.
- We get seven of these a day.

24:31.976 --> 24:33.767
We can't save them all. Okay?

24:33.978 --> 24:37.310
Give her some Jell-O, let her sleep
and move her out.

24:40.483 --> 24:43.021
What if the cords are swollen
from intubation?

24:43.235 --> 24:45.228
We're standing by with Vaponefrin.

24:45.446 --> 24:47.355
What about apnea from brain damage?

24:47.572 --> 24:48.948
His ultrasound was normal.

24:49.157 --> 24:51.648
He's doing really well, Dr. Benton.

24:51.868 --> 24:54.738
And already up to 4 pounds,
10 ounces.

24:55.913 --> 24:59.163
You can hold him if you want.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.411
Yeah, sure.

25:02.626 --> 25:03.825
Go ahead.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.330
Here we go.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.750
That's my little one.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.336
You're doing better now?

25:15.680 --> 25:18.384
Look. He's smiling.

25:25.939 --> 25:28.512
- Where's your student?
- He keeps disappearing.

25:28.691 --> 25:31.478
I can't believe it.
He said he was incapable, but-

25:31.694 --> 25:33.022
I'd take him at his word.

25:33.237 --> 25:35.941
Has the social worker
called back on Mrs. Webb?

25:36.156 --> 25:38.729
- The woman pushed down the stairs.
- Not yet.

25:38.950 --> 25:40.194
Henry!

25:47.457 --> 25:49.165
My throat's a little scratchy.

25:49.375 --> 25:51.830
- This is Mrs. Webb's history?
- I wrote everything.

25:52.044 --> 25:54.203
That's the problem.
There's 20 complaints.

25:54.421 --> 25:57.208
"Back pain, earache,
bumpiness in her head. "

25:57.423 --> 25:59.630
- I don't know what that means.
- Neither did I.

25:59.843 --> 26:02.250
You can hear multiple complaints
but not chart them.

26:02.470 --> 26:06.336
Now that you wrote them, we have to
check them. One moment, Mrs. Webb.

26:06.556 --> 26:11.218
Good rule: If there's more than
3 complaints, odds are nothing's wrong.

26:11.394 --> 26:13.268
- But I wrote them all down.
- I'll be there.

26:13.479 --> 26:16.728
She'll be stuck here the whole night
having tests she doesn't need.

26:16.898 --> 26:20.563
- I don't have to stay all night, do I?
- I like him. Very thorough.

26:20.777 --> 26:22.603
Yes, he is very thorough.

26:22.820 --> 26:26.403
- The social worker will be here soon.
- I can't go back to my sister!

26:26.574 --> 26:29.658
No, they'll try hard to find
a new place for you to stay.

26:30.493 --> 26:33.280
You want to smother me
with that pillow, don't you?

26:33.496 --> 26:35.868
She tried that once before too.

26:36.081 --> 26:37.327
Oh, Mrs. Webb.

26:42.379 --> 26:44.039
How are you doing?

26:44.297 --> 26:45.328
I'm okay.

26:45.548 --> 26:46.746
Your labs came back.

26:46.966 --> 26:48.508
You're dehydrated.

26:48.718 --> 26:51.125
Have you had the flu or been vomiting?

26:53.430 --> 26:57.297
Is there something else going on
that you haven't mentioned to us?

27:05.274 --> 27:07.431
I'm just gonna take one more quick look.

27:08.776 --> 27:10.057
Can you open up for me?

27:16.157 --> 27:19.407
Laura, has your dentist mentioned
the enamel on your teeth?

27:19.619 --> 27:20.864
I hate the dentist.

27:21.078 --> 27:22.822
Yeah, me too.

27:24.457 --> 27:27.125
He's not bipolar or schizophrenic,
but I can't figure him out.

27:27.334 --> 27:28.911
Sure never seen this in a kid.

27:29.127 --> 27:31.962
- I thought you could take a look.
- Sure.

27:32.130 --> 27:34.917
He thinks I'm Sidney Poitier
in Lilies of the Field.

27:35.133 --> 27:36.757
See? See?

27:36.967 --> 27:40.585
If you're wearing a white coat,
then you must be the butcher.

27:40.762 --> 27:42.968
That's not right,
not if you' re the pharmacist.

27:43.139 --> 27:46.472
- Am I here to pick something up?
- They found him wandering the streets.

27:46.642 --> 27:48.599
- BA and tox screen?
- Negative.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.640
He's confabulating.
Complete short-term memory loss.

27:51.855 --> 27:54.725
He has no idea who I am
every time I walk in the room.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.104
The cook! I hope they have lima beans.

27:59.319 --> 28:01.692
Oliver, I'm Dr. Del Amico. Remember?

28:01.906 --> 28:04.657
And this is Dr. Carter and Mr. Henry.

28:04.825 --> 28:07.315
- You're here in the hospital.
- I'm in a hospital?

28:07.535 --> 28:10.489
Okay, if you say so.
Like Jimmy Stewart was in Harvey.

28:11.121 --> 28:13.577
- You feeling okay?
- Sure, I feel fine.

28:14.290 --> 28:16.959
- We'll be back in a little bit, okay?
- Okay.

28:17.168 --> 28:18.911
Lima bean.

28:21.672 --> 28:25.337
I think you're right about the psych
consult. But I'd call one down anyway.

28:25.551 --> 28:28.302
I thought I'd wait on the CT.
See if it reveals anything.

28:28.512 --> 28:32.045
It will. Probably a small lesion
in the mammillary bodies...

28:32.264 --> 28:36.760
...and dorsomedial nucleus of the
thalamus, the mammillothalamic tract.

28:37.269 --> 28:39.143
Associated with
Korsakoff's Syndrome...

28:39.353 --> 28:43.517
...which causes retro- and anterograde
amnesia, thus, short-term memory loss.

28:43.732 --> 28:45.689
And the confabulation.

28:46.818 --> 28:48.858
Could have gone a lifetime
without a translator.

28:49.029 --> 28:52.895
- Can I put in for extra pay?
- Yeah, just run it by Kerry Weaver.

28:56.994 --> 28:58.903
Mr. and Mrs. Trujillo...

28:59.121 --> 29:02.655
...Jesus' x-rays
didn't show anything specific.

29:03.917 --> 29:05.625
Probably has bronchitis.

29:09.379 --> 29:11.455
- Is he gonna be okay?
- He'll be fine.

29:11.674 --> 29:15.801
We're giving him some antibiotics,
and we'll check up on him for a while.

29:19.847 --> 29:22.764
- This is Thomas Anders.
- Department of Social Services.

29:22.974 --> 29:26.308
- Where is he taking me?
- We'll talk on your way to Radiology.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.685
- Back to X-ray?
- Ultrasound, this time.

29:30.356 --> 29:32.313
Wait, my glasses.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.056
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

29:34.275 --> 29:37.192
And we've been trying
to track down your sister.

29:37.403 --> 29:39.941
- Oh, no! Please!
- It'll be okay, Mrs. Webb.

29:40.155 --> 29:43.987
- Jeanie, those slippers you gave me.
- I don't see them.

29:44.201 --> 29:46.526
Maybe they're under the bed.

29:46.995 --> 29:49.949
- Don't let them send me back there.
- Okay.

29:50.165 --> 29:51.873
- Please don't let them.
- I know.

29:52.082 --> 29:55.831
- They can't do it. I can't go.
- Let's get these slippers on.

29:56.045 --> 29:58.500
- There we go. One more.
- Jeanie, please.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.039
Okay. Go ahead.

30:01.424 --> 30:03.914
Carol Hathaway filled me in
on the interviews.

30:04.134 --> 30:05.961
Crackpots. But we'll break one in.

30:06.178 --> 30:09.381
- She felt you should see more.
- I don't. Carter?

30:09.598 --> 30:11.222
- Long as you're confident.
- Yeah.

30:11.432 --> 30:13.389
- Where are you taking her?
- MRl.

30:13.601 --> 30:16.092
- She's a drunk.
- Just to be sure. I did an LP.

30:16.270 --> 30:17.645
And I think I need an MRl.

30:17.896 --> 30:20.683
I ran everything by Dr. Doyle.
She agreed.

30:22.359 --> 30:24.268
Let your student handle the transport.

30:24.693 --> 30:27.729
Henry's collecting stool samples
on three abdominal pains.

30:27.946 --> 30:30.272
- Can you page Henry again?
- I already did, twice.

30:30.824 --> 30:31.987
Again.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.446
- Here you go.
- Mark.

30:34.619 --> 30:37.489
- I just checked in on Laura Quentin.
- Yeah, I saw her labs.

30:37.705 --> 30:41.572
Urine specific gravity's low.
Mildly hypokalemic. Probably got the flu.

30:41.792 --> 30:44.413
Actually, she's bulimic.
I checked her teeth.

30:44.628 --> 30:48.541
The enamel's eroded, consistent with
the vomiting. No period in six months.

30:48.756 --> 30:50.796
Took a lot,
but she finally admitted to it.

30:50.967 --> 30:52.509
Let's rehydrate her.

30:52.718 --> 30:55.209
Two liters of normal saline.
Turf her to Psych.

30:55.429 --> 30:58.513
She doesn't want to go.
Doesn't want her parents to know.

30:58.724 --> 31:02.506
I called the eating-disorders clinic.
There's no availability for seven weeks.

31:02.727 --> 31:03.805
Nothing we can do.

31:04.311 --> 31:07.181
- Thought you could talk to her.
- Won't do much good.

31:07.397 --> 31:10.600
- Can't hurt to try.
- Look, I got a lot of patients, Carol.

31:10.816 --> 31:14.019
- Come on, Mark. She might listen to you.
- We're an ER.

31:14.236 --> 31:17.439
We don't manage chronic problems.
Her condition is chronic.

31:18.156 --> 31:21.073
And if you have concerns about
other desk-clerk candidates...

31:21.284 --> 31:24.368
...run them by me first
before you go to Kerry Weaver.

31:28.748 --> 31:31.998
- Henry was right. There it is.
- That's the lesion?

31:32.168 --> 31:34.208
- It's large.
- Yeah.

31:34.421 --> 31:38.204
Come on. You're about to get your
first taste of giving the bad news.

31:40.675 --> 31:43.711
Oh, hi. Well, you see,
I don't need a haircut.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.547
You're not the barber, are you?

31:45.763 --> 31:48.799
Oliver, I'm Dr. Del Amico,
and you're in a hospital.

31:49.016 --> 31:52.431
Well, whatever you say is fine.
But I feel just great, see?

31:52.644 --> 31:55.728
- Just like Jimmy Stewart was in Harvey.
- Oliver.

31:55.939 --> 31:58.062
I need you to listen to me for a minute.

31:58.274 --> 32:02.485
We took a picture of your brain.
You have a tumor on the right side.

32:03.988 --> 32:06.988
You look like Carole Lombard.
She had a brain tumor.

32:07.198 --> 32:10.151
- Oliver, it's very serious.
- Serious?

32:11.827 --> 32:13.321
Are you saying I'm gonna die?

32:14.121 --> 32:18.533
The people upstairs in Surgery will do
all they can. But we can't be sure.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.454
I'm gonna die?

32:23.212 --> 32:25.584
I'm gonna die.

32:25.798 --> 32:28.122
Oh, God!

32:29.634 --> 32:32.587
Oh, God.

32:41.644 --> 32:45.428
What are you doing up here? You're
supposed to be on your ER rotation.

32:45.648 --> 32:49.348
If I don't load the sequencing gel now,
it could ruin the whole experiment.

32:49.568 --> 32:53.731
- Doesn't your ER rotation mean anything?
- Beyond its being a requirement?

32:55.824 --> 32:56.854
What's all this stuff?

32:57.200 --> 33:01.861
This is a plasma control with 10
micrograms of salmon-sperm carrier.

33:02.203 --> 33:04.492
Would you like to see my linkage map?

33:06.040 --> 33:09.290
Wait! Don't touch this!
This is ethidium bromide.

33:09.501 --> 33:13.581
It can slip between your DNA,
cause a mutation.

33:16.090 --> 33:18.925
No! Don't touch the Eppendorf.

33:25.766 --> 33:28.636
Did you feed him yet?
I got stuck in the O.R.

33:28.851 --> 33:31.259
Tabash says I can't try
until this evening.

33:31.479 --> 33:34.266
Good. I thought I was gonna
miss the first time.

33:34.482 --> 33:36.888
Listen, I'm on tonight.

33:37.109 --> 33:39.101
But page me, and I'll come straight up.

33:39.652 --> 33:42.273
- How's he doing?
- He's doing great.

33:42.530 --> 33:44.273
But they're asking for a name.

33:44.448 --> 33:48.991
- We gotta do this birth certificate.
- I guess we have put it off.

33:49.202 --> 33:53.911
We? No. I had no idea
you could be so superstitious.

33:54.123 --> 33:57.040
Well, neither did I.

33:57.292 --> 34:00.957
So, what'll we do? Are we gonna
flip a coin? Reece or Benton?

34:01.129 --> 34:02.244
Carla...

34:03.339 --> 34:05.711
...we talked about it
and said it'd be Benton.

34:05.924 --> 34:07.917
It's easier for the insurance.

34:08.469 --> 34:11.386
We talked about it,
but we definitely did not agree on it.

34:11.722 --> 34:13.630
That insurance reason
is an excuse.

34:13.973 --> 34:16.380
You just want your boy
to have your last name.

34:17.226 --> 34:20.476
- What's wrong with that?
- What's wrong with having my name?

34:20.646 --> 34:23.433
I'm the one getting up at night
to feed him...

34:23.649 --> 34:26.139
...change him,
rock him back to sleep.

34:26.318 --> 34:27.562
Carla, I can do that too.

34:27.777 --> 34:30.481
So you're just gonna move
into my apartment now?

34:30.654 --> 34:32.112
We haven't talked about it-

34:32.322 --> 34:35.655
No, because you acted like
this day was never gonna come.

34:37.577 --> 34:38.655
He needs a family.

34:41.496 --> 34:46.324
- Is that what you think we are?
- We don't have to formalize things.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.504
If there wasn't a baby in the picture...

34:52.715 --> 34:55.170
...would you see the two of us
as a family?

35:03.307 --> 35:06.177
It's okay, Peter. I don't either.

35:19.446 --> 35:22.019
22-year-old female,
GSW to the left upper chest...

35:22.240 --> 35:26.072
...two IVs of saline in the field,
BP 100/60, pulse 110.

35:26.243 --> 35:28.817
- O2, 15 liters by mask.
- Hey! Look out!

35:29.913 --> 35:32.451
- Who is that guy?
- Checking for radioactivity.

35:32.666 --> 35:35.915
- God, I love this job.
- Okay, let's go!

35:37.795 --> 35:39.076
One, two, three.

35:40.589 --> 35:41.834
Get her clothes off.

35:42.383 --> 35:44.421
- What've we got?
- Gunshot wound.

35:44.592 --> 35:47.083
- Two in one day?
- Honey, you haven't been here long.

35:47.261 --> 35:49.337
- I can run it.
- Why don't I have a go at it.

35:51.431 --> 35:53.554
Right. The usual investigations.

35:53.767 --> 35:58.013
FBC, type and crossmatch four units,
and portable radiograph of the chest.

35:58.229 --> 35:59.509
- FBC?
- Full blood count.

36:00.356 --> 36:02.598
Run a liter of saline
and a gram of cephalexin.

36:02.817 --> 36:04.939
Trachea's midline,
no jugular distention.

36:05.110 --> 36:07.779
Strong radial pulse,
subclavian's intact.

36:07.987 --> 36:11.605
- Pulse ox is 92 on 15 liters.
- BP's 95 palp.

36:11.824 --> 36:14.231
Diminished breath.
She'll need a tube thoracostomy.

36:14.410 --> 36:16.034
- A what?
- Chest tube.

36:16.203 --> 36:18.159
Could you intubate, please?

36:18.830 --> 36:21.831
Number 8 ET tube and suction.

36:22.041 --> 36:24.413
I wonder if everyone
might slow down just a bit.

36:24.627 --> 36:28.576
I think things will run more smoothly
with a little more peace and quiet.

36:29.590 --> 36:32.756
- Anyone bleeped Dr. Benton?
- He'll like that. "Bleeping" Benton.

36:32.967 --> 36:36.466
- Perhaps somebody could ring him up?
- Page, right? That's page Benton?

36:36.637 --> 36:37.668
I got it.

36:37.888 --> 36:40.461
- One percent lidocaine.
- All right, I'll get it.

36:42.642 --> 36:45.477
Okay. I'm in. Let's bag her.

36:45.979 --> 36:48.516
We're out. I'll get some from Supply.

36:56.237 --> 36:58.229
Connie, get the lidocaine.

36:58.447 --> 37:00.356
Anna, we need your help.

37:03.368 --> 37:04.910
What is it? What happened?

37:06.621 --> 37:07.819
He stopped breathing.

37:08.747 --> 37:12.448
Pedes laryngoscope and a number 6
ET tube. Get ready to bag him.

37:18.506 --> 37:21.211
- What happened?
- Dr. Corday just stabilized your patient.

37:21.426 --> 37:23.050
GSW to the left upper chest.

37:23.261 --> 37:26.345
Came in with a pressure of 100/60.
Received two liters of crystalloid.

37:26.554 --> 37:29.721
Spun hematocrit is 34.
Gave a gram of cephalexin.

37:29.933 --> 37:32.637
Placed a left thoracostomy tube
with 300 cc's of blood.

37:33.144 --> 37:35.349
Missed the great vessels. Lucky girl.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.604
- I guess you were paying attention.
- Always.

37:44.154 --> 37:46.359
- Her sister died in 1984.
- That's right.

37:46.530 --> 37:49.400
- So obviously her sister did not push her.
- Not recently.

37:49.575 --> 37:51.484
- I'll kill her.
- Can't. She's borderline.

37:51.659 --> 37:53.866
You can never get rid of borderlines.

37:54.037 --> 37:56.609
Randi, call Psych for me.
I need a consult.

37:56.831 --> 37:59.867
They won't admit until Medicine's
completed her evaluation.

38:00.042 --> 38:03.540
I'm still waiting on eight tests.
You know what I've done for her today?

38:03.753 --> 38:06.670
- She says you tried to suffocate her.
- She what?

38:06.881 --> 38:08.423
Gratitude.

38:08.799 --> 38:10.922
Have you seen Dr. Carter?
He keeps paging me.

38:11.134 --> 38:13.708
Come with me.
You're about to do some babysitting.

38:13.887 --> 38:15.132
Come on.

38:18.808 --> 38:20.136
Hi, Mrs. Webb.

38:20.351 --> 38:22.058
You remember Henry.

38:24.896 --> 38:26.390
I asked if he'd had his shots.

38:26.564 --> 38:29.600
They didn't know you meant vaccines.
They thought you meant any shots.

38:29.817 --> 38:33.648
- I didn't think of whooping cough.
- It presents like bronchitis.

38:33.862 --> 38:35.237
Thanks for stepping in.

38:35.405 --> 38:37.232
Oh, God. Excuse me.

38:37.407 --> 38:40.194
Malik, he was supposed to be up
in Neurology an hour ago.

38:40.410 --> 38:43.031
We're on our way up.
Dr. Weaver needed some labs stat.

38:43.246 --> 38:44.740
Get him up there now, please.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.410
Hi, there! You're the ice-cream person,
aren't you?

38:47.583 --> 38:51.081
You don't want to spill on that coat.
No, you're the pharmacist.

38:51.252 --> 38:52.580
I have my toothpaste.

38:52.753 --> 38:56.252
- Do you remember you're in the hospital?
- Hospital?

38:56.757 --> 38:58.548
Is something wrong with me?

39:01.928 --> 39:04.881
Dr. Greene, I need you
to sign a chart for me.

39:05.097 --> 39:07.055
It's for that woman with slurred speech.

39:07.266 --> 39:09.092
Did she finally dry out?

39:09.309 --> 39:13.141
Not exactly. LP showed pleocytosis
and elevated gamma globulins.

39:13.354 --> 39:15.596
MRl confirms she has
multiple sclerosis.

39:15.815 --> 39:17.937
You order a Neurology consult?

39:18.150 --> 39:20.308
- Yes.
- Good.

39:21.945 --> 39:25.527
- I am now officially having a bad day.
- What?

39:25.740 --> 39:29.689
The one non-puking kid I had
almost died of whooping cough.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.991
I'm ready for a drink.
You want to join me?

39:32.204 --> 39:34.078
I can't. What's your bad day?

39:34.289 --> 39:36.032
Remember Chris Law?

39:36.249 --> 39:38.786
His brother died.
The basketball player, right?

39:39.001 --> 39:41.955
Well, that's what the process server
was about this morning.

39:42.129 --> 39:45.747
He and his family are slapping me
with a malpractice suit.

39:46.174 --> 39:47.798
It's a great world, huh?

39:47.967 --> 39:50.671
First he beats me up,
and then he sues me.

39:50.886 --> 39:54.504
Law didn't beat you up, did he?
Police said he had an airtight alibi.

39:55.557 --> 39:57.514
That's what the police said.

39:58.435 --> 40:00.142
But you don't believe them?

40:02.313 --> 40:03.642
I don't know.

40:09.570 --> 40:12.689
So, what happened
with your amnesia patient?

40:12.905 --> 40:16.654
Kept forgetting he was dying.
I had to tell him five different times.

40:16.867 --> 40:19.619
And after all that,
they give us this humiliation.

40:20.829 --> 40:22.406
Wow, a paycheck!

40:22.622 --> 40:23.653
Alleged paycheck.

40:23.831 --> 40:26.832
The rich kids at CHOP would
blow it on poker the first night.

40:27.043 --> 40:30.328
- Didn't think I'd care.
- About getting a paycheck?

40:30.879 --> 40:34.711
No, I meant I didn't think money
would make that much of a difference.

40:34.925 --> 40:37.711
Well, it won't
after I pay my landlord...

40:37.927 --> 40:40.844
...the med-school bills,
my phone bill, the gas bill.

40:41.012 --> 40:42.590
Should leave me about 4 bucks.

40:42.806 --> 40:44.466
Oh, yeah. Me too.

40:46.184 --> 40:47.726
- See you.
- See you.

40:50.563 --> 40:52.354
- Hey, Dr. Weaver.
- John.

40:52.565 --> 40:57.025
I know I said I didn't need to be paid,
but it sure feels good. Thank you.

40:57.235 --> 40:59.357
I'd hoped to catch you
before you got it.

40:59.570 --> 41:02.357
I need you to endorse your check
back over to County.

41:02.573 --> 41:04.814
- What?
- To cover disability and malpractice.

41:04.991 --> 41:07.364
They issue one weekly,
and you sign it back to us.

41:07.536 --> 41:09.574
- Endorse it back over to County.
- Right.

41:09.787 --> 41:11.863
- Every week?
- That's what we agreed.

41:12.081 --> 41:14.120
You didn't need to be paid?

41:19.254 --> 41:20.368
Right.

41:22.173 --> 41:24.498
All right. Thank you.

41:25.592 --> 41:26.791
Pen.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.678
- Been up to any of the labs recently?
- Why?

41:35.059 --> 41:36.719
- Give me your shoes.
- What?

41:36.894 --> 41:39.349
I said, give me your shoes.
They're radioactive.

41:39.563 --> 41:41.057
You know how much they cost?

41:41.231 --> 41:42.642
- Radioactive?
- Give him your shoes.

41:42.899 --> 41:44.274
- I won't.
- Yes, you will.

41:56.244 --> 41:57.275
Hey.

41:58.746 --> 42:01.415
- He's really doing it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

42:01.581 --> 42:04.250
This boy is really doing it.

42:04.751 --> 42:06.708
Only lasts a couple of minutes, though.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.746
Then he gets really tired.

42:17.095 --> 42:18.673
Listen...

42:19.555 --> 42:22.306
...I thought about
what we talked about...

42:23.642 --> 42:26.559
...and I don't have any more claim
on his name than you do.

42:27.895 --> 42:29.437
I'd be happy with "Reece. "

42:30.649 --> 42:31.846
I would.

42:32.108 --> 42:35.642
Well, I thought about it too, Peter.

42:36.195 --> 42:37.986
And I'd be okay with Benton.

42:41.282 --> 42:44.733
So why don't we name him...

42:45.411 --> 42:47.284
...Reece Benton?

42:49.873 --> 42:52.079
Reece Benton.

42:54.127 --> 42:56.582
Sounds a little formal...

42:56.796 --> 42:58.124
...but we'll get used to it.

43:01.174 --> 43:03.001
Reece Benton.

43:05.762 --> 43:08.466
Yeah. Yeah, we will.

43:24.194 --> 43:25.357
Dr. Greene.

43:25.571 --> 43:28.441
Sorry to bother you.
Do you remember me? I-

43:28.657 --> 43:31.408
- You're...
- Cynthia Hooper.

43:31.825 --> 43:34.151
You've been hanging out here all day?

43:34.328 --> 43:36.403
No. Well, I sat over at the diner.

43:36.621 --> 43:39.112
Look, I know I'm out of contention
for the job.

43:39.332 --> 43:41.490
I just wanted to apologize
for my interview.

43:41.709 --> 43:45.291
I just get so nervous,
and I never say the right thing.

43:46.671 --> 43:47.834
Happens to all of us.

43:48.047 --> 43:52.127
At least I didn't throw up, which
I actually have done in an interview.

43:52.302 --> 43:53.879
That probably hurt the interview.

43:57.013 --> 43:59.172
Is this your first time in Chicago?

43:59.349 --> 44:01.092
Yeah. Thanks.

44:04.687 --> 44:08.387
I've only been here for six days.
But I'm starting to figure it out.

44:08.607 --> 44:10.515
The lake is...

44:10.734 --> 44:12.109
- ... that way.
- That way.

44:12.277 --> 44:13.391
Right.

44:18.616 --> 44:20.323
I'm glad you stopped by...

44:20.492 --> 44:24.536
...because I didn't make any phone calls
yet. And so I can just tell you that...

44:24.746 --> 44:26.406
...you got the job.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.237
What?

44:29.208 --> 44:32.244
- You're kidding, right?
- No, it's yours if you want it.

44:33.211 --> 44:35.168
Of course I want it.

44:35.338 --> 44:37.745
- Are you sure you're not kidding?
- Start next week.

44:39.300 --> 44:40.877
Oh, my God!

44:41.427 --> 44:43.715
I don't know what to say. Thank you.

44:44.471 --> 44:47.258
- You're welcome. Good night.
- Good night.

44:55.522 --> 44:58.226
- Are they closed?
- Closed.

44:59.234 --> 45:01.903
- Keep them closed.
- I said, they're closed.

45:03.738 --> 45:04.983
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:05.197 --> 45:06.442
Open them.

45:08.075 --> 45:09.617
All right.

45:11.285 --> 45:12.910
That was very delicate, Doug.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.365
What the...?

45:14.955 --> 45:16.615
Oh, that's a drawer.

45:18.083 --> 45:19.245
You know what?

45:19.418 --> 45:21.576
- I love this drawer.
- Good.

45:21.752 --> 45:23.330
Come here, you.

45:24.547 --> 45:25.922
Come here.

45:31.887 --> 45:35.337
You know what, I love sitting
out here on the porch with you.

45:36.307 --> 45:38.264
- It's-
- Something new.

45:38.434 --> 45:40.391
Something new.

45:44.439 --> 45:45.933
Nice drawer.

45:46.107 --> 45:48.100
It's a good touch, don't you think?
