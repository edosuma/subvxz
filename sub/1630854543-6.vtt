WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:05.400
We're looking for someone -
Roger Parslow.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.320
You shouldn't
have come to this place.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.880
WHISPERING:  They're listening...

00:08.880 --> 00:12.040
You will deliver
my message to Metatron!

00:12.040 --> 00:13.240
SCREAMING

00:13.240 --> 00:15.360
METATRON: On your knees
before the Authority.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.680
The mortal Lord Asriel
is harnessing technology

00:17.680 --> 00:19.280
to challenge you.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.680
Roger!

00:20.680 --> 00:23.120
It's me. It's your best friend.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.920
Our bomb is equipped
with a guidance mechanism.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.040
We will use the lock
of your daughter's hair

00:28.040 --> 00:30.880
to locate her and to destroy her.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.280
Those stories. What were they?

00:33.280 --> 00:35.120
They were about the outside world.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.960
Your stories have
made us feel alive again.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.080
We... We will come with you.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.200
It's Dust.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.640
Sraf is Dust.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.960
It's leaving.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.680
What's your name?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.280
No name.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.680
Lyra? Lyra!

00:55.680 --> 00:57.520
You found the knife-bearer.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.360
Let's follow the kid
with the knife!

01:07.560 --> 01:09.920
Shine your perpetual light upon us!

01:11.000 --> 01:15.280
METATRON: It's time to send
these mortals a warning.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.600
HIGH-PITCHED RINGING

01:19.680 --> 01:21.160
WHOOSHING

01:25.080 --> 01:26.960
RUMBLING

01:33.920 --> 01:38.680
METATRON: In the beginning,
man was given the gift of Dust.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.200
It ignited his mind
and freed his will.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.920
But that free will
has corrupted mankind.

01:51.560 --> 01:56.360
Dust shall be drawn into
eternal darkness once more.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.320
That which was given...

02:02.360 --> 02:04.560
FADING ..shall be taken away.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.080
SHE GASPS

03:02.560 --> 03:04.160
GRUNTING SOFTLY

03:22.240 --> 03:25.720
Mrs Coulter! What happened? I...

03:27.320 --> 03:29.760
Tell me if my daughter survived.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.920
Now!

03:42.880 --> 03:45.160
ALETHIOMETER CLICKS

03:46.160 --> 03:47.240
She's...

03:48.520 --> 03:51.440
..in...darkness.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.600
What does it say?

04:32.520 --> 04:33.760
Lyra?

04:34.720 --> 04:36.160
Lyra?

04:36.160 --> 04:38.280
Lyra!

04:38.280 --> 04:41.240
ECHOING:  Lyra!

05:33.040 --> 05:35.280
SNARLING

05:38.560 --> 05:40.920
RUSTLING

06:12.000 --> 06:14.680
ALARM BLARES
METER BEEPS

06:14.680 --> 06:16.320
Dust readings are fluctuating.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.360
BEEPING CONTINUES

06:27.360 --> 06:29.360
LOW RUMBLING

06:36.480 --> 06:38.920
RUMBLING AND CRACKING

07:04.680 --> 07:07.040
No. No, no, no.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.560
HE CHUCKLES

07:12.560 --> 07:14.200
Stelmaria, this is it.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.640
Alarbus has delivered our message!

07:18.160 --> 07:20.400
RUMBLING CONTINUES

07:22.920 --> 07:24.960
SHE PANTS

07:50.760 --> 07:53.160
METALLIC CLANKING

08:01.160 --> 08:02.560
GROWLING

08:02.560 --> 08:04.080
It's her.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.560
HE SIGHS

08:15.520 --> 08:17.360
You're back.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.760
That's good.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.600
Come and have a look at this.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.680
You recall
the intercision field chamber

08:25.680 --> 08:28.320
and the effect that it had
on our friend,

08:28.320 --> 08:30.160
the incarcerated angel, yes?

08:30.160 --> 08:31.520
HE LAUGHS

08:31.520 --> 08:36.000
Its ability to draw and
trap Dust forever?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.760
This abyss is much the same,

08:38.760 --> 08:42.720
only on a magnitude
I never thought possible.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.200
We are going to be able to use that.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.960
She's dead, Asriel.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.240
Lyra...is dead.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.640
Hmm.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.960
Would you like me to tell you
how your daughter died?

09:09.960 --> 09:14.040
Or would you prefer to keep
tinkering with your toys?

09:14.040 --> 09:17.720
If what you're saying is true,
I am very sorry.

09:19.680 --> 09:24.200
But what I am doing here
is of the utmost importance.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.240
It is going to change everything.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.160
How, Asriel? How?
How will this change anything?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.160
Can't hear it. Not now.
You will hear this.

09:32.160 --> 09:35.960
The Magisterium created a bomb
to target our child using her DNA.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.920
Last night, we attempted
to disable it.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.520
Lord Roke died trying.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.760
HE SIGHS You mustn't blame yourself.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.280
You clearly...  Oh, believe me,

09:48.280 --> 09:50.280
I'm not blaming myself.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.440
I know that technology.

09:53.440 --> 09:54.920
I designed it.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.120
I stopped it from detonating.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.520
But a bolt of light

10:02.520 --> 10:05.720
struck the intercision chamber
and triggered the release...

10:07.240 --> 10:09.720
..sending the bomb straight to Lyra.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.520
Angelic light.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.360
Metatron's answer to your war cry.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.440
If you hadn't baited him,

10:25.440 --> 10:27.360
Lyra would still be alive.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.760
Do you understand?

10:32.360 --> 10:35.080
You've taken my daughter from me.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.280
And I will never forgive you.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.200
Lyra.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.560
Wake up.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.440
Wake up!

11:38.520 --> 11:39.880
HE GASPS

11:40.880 --> 11:42.680
Please, wake up.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.160
CRASHING

11:47.440 --> 11:49.960
SHOUTING AND SCREAMING

11:52.000 --> 11:54.040
Are you OK?

11:54.040 --> 11:56.520
WEAKLY: I think so.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.040
What was that?

12:01.520 --> 12:03.600
DISTANT SHOUTING

12:13.080 --> 12:14.560
You shouldn't go down there.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.600
It's nothing to worry about.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.880
Asriel, this is reckless.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.000
Asriel!

13:02.680 --> 13:04.160
Dust.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.960
IN MULEFA:

13:14.240 --> 13:18.280
Before, the flow was steady
and slow.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.880
Now it's like a flood...

13:21.600 --> 13:23.600
..pouring out of this world...

13:24.960 --> 13:29.680
..into some kind of emptiness.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.960
It was like the trees
were straining against it,

13:42.960 --> 13:45.000
like they were trying
to hold the tide back.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.520
Any news from Sergi?

14:18.520 --> 14:20.680
He's scouting the area.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.520
I've called for Serafina.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.480
OK. We're stabilising the area now.

14:32.680 --> 14:33.840
CAWING

14:33.840 --> 14:36.160
SHE GASPS

14:36.160 --> 14:37.560
Ruta?

14:37.560 --> 14:40.560
SHE GASPS It's Sergi. He's in pain.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.400
SERGI SQUAWKS

14:43.400 --> 14:45.440
H-He can't hear me.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.200
SQUAWKING

14:48.200 --> 14:49.680
Just stay with him.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.040
I can't stop him.

14:52.040 --> 14:55.120
The darkness is drawing him in.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.360
Oh, no.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.040
You can fight this.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.840
I can't.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.920
I can't.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.200
Yambe-akka.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.120
Yambe-akka.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.400
No!

15:29.680 --> 15:30.960
Ruta...

15:35.200 --> 15:36.720
HE SIGHS

15:39.840 --> 15:41.320
DISTANT SCREECHING

15:43.000 --> 15:45.040
Lee!  Lyra!

15:48.840 --> 15:51.760
Are you OK?
That was a heck of a blast.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.040
Do you think it's
those creatures that did it?

15:57.040 --> 16:00.320
No. This is way more powerful,
like nothing I've ever seen.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.520
Is it because we're here?
Do you think it was our fault?

16:05.560 --> 16:07.880
BOOMING RUMBLE

16:12.280 --> 16:15.160
We can't stay here.
We need to keep moving.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.800
We've got to get these people
out of here.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.680
ROGER:  This way!

16:19.680 --> 16:22.840
Lyra! It goes up!

16:24.000 --> 16:25.960
Onwards and upwards, people!

16:55.880 --> 16:59.840
LOW RUMBLING

17:04.600 --> 17:06.640
CRASHING AND SHOUTING

17:14.840 --> 17:17.720
Are you OK?  Yeah. You?

17:17.720 --> 17:19.000
Yeah.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.760
That blast tore this place apart.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.640
BOOMING AND CRASHING

17:35.360 --> 17:37.640
MUFFLED:  Hey! Lyra!

17:37.640 --> 17:39.160
Hey, Lyra!

17:40.440 --> 17:42.960
It's not that far. We can jump it.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.680
Do you think they can make it?

17:44.680 --> 17:46.200
They can if they have to.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.760
What do you think would happen
if we fell?

17:55.800 --> 17:57.240
No, stop!

18:01.720 --> 18:03.160
All these people are following us

18:03.160 --> 18:04.840
cos they think we know
where we're going.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.000
They think I can get us out of here,
but what if I can't?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.920
Please, look at me.
What if we're trapped here?

18:08.920 --> 18:11.400
Because I can't use...  Look at me.
..the knife.  Look at me.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.280
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Hey. Hey.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.880
It's fine.
We're going to get out of here.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.600
It's just this chasm.
I can feel it, too.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.640
Look at me.

18:25.640 --> 18:26.960
Watch.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.040
Whoo! HE CHUCKLES

18:37.600 --> 18:39.480
I'll go next.  No, I'll go.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.520
I can do it.  So can I.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.920
Are you coming?

18:53.920 --> 18:55.320
Will?

19:01.480 --> 19:03.280
OGUNWE:  Asriel!

19:03.280 --> 19:04.800
Ogunwe, this is it.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.880
This abyss... It is an act of war.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.560
Ruta's daemon Sergi
was pulled into this thing

19:10.560 --> 19:13.360
because he was made of Dust.
Well, so are angels.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.440
Listen, you have asked us
to have blind faith

19:17.440 --> 19:19.280
in you while rejecting
all our beliefs,

19:19.280 --> 19:22.200
and now Queen Ruta is dead
as a result.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.160
I see past the loss. Open your eyes.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.160
This is not a setback.
It is a bloody gift.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.800
GUARD:  Stay back! Stay back!

19:34.800 --> 19:36.400
Get back!

19:38.240 --> 19:39.520
Who are you?

19:39.520 --> 19:42.200
I am Serafina Pekkala,
queen of the Lake Enara clan,

19:42.200 --> 19:44.520
and I demand to know
what happened to my sister.

19:44.520 --> 19:48.840
Hold fire.  Queen Serafina Pekkala,
welcome to the Republic.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.000
Please let it be known
that Ruta Skadi was an ally

19:51.000 --> 19:53.400
and a valuable asset
in our rebellion.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.440
I heard her call for her death.

20:01.440 --> 20:05.040
She felt the presence
of a great darkness.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.280
And then she was gone.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.840
I'm sorry.  But I...

20:08.840 --> 20:12.400
But I sense her here still.
It pains me to tell you both

20:12.400 --> 20:15.080
that what happened to Ruta
was not death, but worse again.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.840
That abyss out there is
a rupture in the multiverse,

20:19.840 --> 20:22.600
sucking all Dust deep down inside

20:22.600 --> 20:24.560
the void between the worlds.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.720
I bore witness to her daemon
Sergi falling inside,

20:27.720 --> 20:31.840
and it is my belief
that no being, flesh or Dust,

20:31.840 --> 20:33.840
will ever emerge from its darkness.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.000
So there will be no peace for her?

20:39.560 --> 20:41.880
Part of her soul forever falling.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.800
Forever in limbo.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.840
I saw the chasm
as I was flying over here.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.200
It tore through every world
I crossed.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.760
You did this.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.000
No.  Your arrogance,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.600
playing with forces
you have no concept of!

21:08.600 --> 21:09.960
Weapons down.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.560
I am at your mercy.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.160
Do with me as you will.

21:13.160 --> 21:18.040
But let it be known that the
loss of Queen Ruta Skadi

21:18.040 --> 21:20.120
is as keenly felt by myself
as it is by you.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.880
We believe it is Metatron's doing.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.200
His answer to our provocation.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.920
We have his attention now.
He will be coming for me.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.800
If revenge is what you truly
want for your sister queen,

21:30.800 --> 21:34.160
then by my side is the only place
you will find it.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.520
DISTANT SCREECHING

22:05.720 --> 22:07.800
SCREECHING CONTINUES

22:09.560 --> 22:11.880
Mangy vermin.  We've seen worse.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.760
Do you remember
when you freed the kids

22:13.760 --> 22:16.040
from Bolvangar and then
the three of us and Iorek

22:16.040 --> 22:19.000
squashed into Lee's balloon
and just flew away?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.520
Iorek's this armoured bear...

22:20.520 --> 22:23.800
I know who he is. I've met him.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.080
Can't imagine him in a balloon,
though.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.840
It wasn't just any balloon.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.400
It was a real beauty.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.120
She was.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.960
Roger, you're permanently
terrified of flying.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.560
I was not.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.960
Only when those cliff-ghasts
attacked.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.720
It was the middle of the night.
Roger and I were fast asleep.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.360
I was keeping watch, actually.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.120
And then, suddenly, out of nowhere,

22:46.120 --> 22:48.840
these creatures were just all
over us. Lee's shooting them.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.800
Iorek's roaring.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.360
And then you fell out.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.760
LYRA LAUGHS

22:55.200 --> 22:56.600
Hey, did I ever tell you

22:56.600 --> 22:58.920
about the crazy shaman who
made me a bacon sandwich?

23:09.400 --> 23:12.240
Commander Ogunwe,
where is the, um...

23:13.760 --> 23:16.080
..intention craft?

23:16.080 --> 23:17.720
I'm ready to leave.

23:17.720 --> 23:21.000
I'm afraid I can't let you leave
again without council approval.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.320
Oh, come on.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.200
Let's not pretend.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.760
The only vote that counts
around here is Asriel's.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.400
And he acts purely
in his own interests.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.080
You should do the same.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.400
But I'm not like the two of you.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.760
I'm here for something
other than my own interests.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.880
What's happened?

23:52.320 --> 23:53.680
Lyra's dead.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.400
I'm so sorry.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.200
Asriel didn't tell me.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.560
So, are you going to give me
that vehicle or not?

24:07.680 --> 24:10.240
Asriel took it and flew north.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.880
I'm sorry.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.880
Come.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.600
Come!

24:35.880 --> 24:37.400
Where are you...?

24:45.240 --> 24:47.960
HARPIES SQUAWK

25:14.920 --> 25:16.560
Are you looking for your father?

25:18.120 --> 25:19.920
What chance do we have?

25:19.920 --> 25:23.320
We found them, and we thought
it was impossible.

25:26.320 --> 25:29.200
I just want to be sure
he'll find his way out

25:29.200 --> 25:30.560
before we go to Asriel.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.160
We could send a message back,
maybe? Spread the word?

25:35.160 --> 25:36.720
What's his name?  John Parry.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.920
John Parry?

25:40.920 --> 25:43.600
John...Parry...

25:43.600 --> 25:45.520
Jopari!

25:45.520 --> 25:47.960
The man of many names.
He told me about you.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.560
You're the shaman's son.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.240
You know him?

25:53.240 --> 25:55.480
Yeah, I know him. LEE CHUCKLES

25:55.480 --> 25:58.280
He's a hard man to find.
I got leeches on my ass trying,

25:58.280 --> 25:59.840
but it was worth it, though.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.360
Lucky for you, we might have
a way to summon him.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.000
No promises, but it's worth a try.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.240
Are you sure about this?

26:38.840 --> 26:41.280
HE SIGHS He'll listen to reason.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.680
HE SNUFFLES

26:45.680 --> 26:47.840
King Iorek... HE ROARS

26:47.840 --> 26:49.360
HE GRUNTS

26:49.360 --> 26:50.680
I'm unarmed.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.320
IOREK GROWLS

26:52.320 --> 26:54.360
Killing me will provide poor sport.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.680
It greatly saddens to see the damage

27:00.680 --> 27:03.000
my work has done to your lands.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.680
My bears starve because
you blew a hole in the sky!

27:07.680 --> 27:11.560
King Iorek, there is worse
to come if my war is not won.

27:11.560 --> 27:15.600
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't kill you!

27:15.600 --> 27:17.560
Lyra Silvertongue!

27:17.560 --> 27:20.480
Why do you speak to me of her?

27:22.280 --> 27:23.680
You renamed her.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.160
You loved her.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.560
Tell me of her.

27:32.720 --> 27:37.000
She is everything you are not.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.400
HE GRUNTS

27:42.640 --> 27:45.000
Perhaps I should have
known her better.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.280
But she is gone.

27:50.280 --> 27:54.040
And if you kill me now,
she will never be avenged.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.520
HE GRUNTS

27:56.520 --> 27:59.800
You do not understand.

27:59.800 --> 28:03.240
Lyra went to the land of the dead.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.880
The land of the...  Yes.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.480
But she walked in alive.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.320
How did she enter that place?

28:16.320 --> 28:17.680
The knife.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.600
The knife is broken.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.120
I fixed it.

28:23.120 --> 28:26.000
She went after her friend Roger.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.480
The kitchen boy.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.760
Another reason
why I should kill you!

28:30.760 --> 28:32.800
Wait, wait, wait!

28:32.800 --> 28:35.320
If, when we die, we are judged
by the Authority

28:35.320 --> 28:38.880
and sent to either heaven
or hell, then in which is Lyra?

28:38.880 --> 28:40.680
Neither.

28:40.680 --> 28:44.840
It is a soulless place
where the dead go

28:44.840 --> 28:46.680
but can never escape.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.880
Everlasting prison?

28:55.320 --> 28:56.960
HE CHUCKLES

28:58.680 --> 29:00.120
Why, then...

29:01.480 --> 29:06.600
..my daughter is staging
a prison break.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.480
HE LAUGHS

29:09.480 --> 29:11.600
IOREK GRUMBLES

29:31.720 --> 29:34.440
CREAKING AND RUMBLING

30:05.200 --> 30:07.120
MUFFLED:  Lyra, don't look down.

30:13.160 --> 30:16.640
CREAKING INTENSIFIES

30:18.080 --> 30:19.720
MUFFLED:  Lyra!

30:25.680 --> 30:27.920
SQUAWKING

31:03.640 --> 31:06.080
Ogunwe told me about Lyra.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.120
I'm so sorry.

31:18.120 --> 31:21.000
I tortured one of
your witches once.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.400
I know who you are.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.160
I mutilated her.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.760
Pulled out her cloud-pine.

31:37.760 --> 31:41.760
You know, she suffered terribly.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.200
She screamed out.

31:46.040 --> 31:49.480
She begged for her death.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.920
I see what you're trying
to make me do.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.200
Come on.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.400
Do it.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.960
You know you want to.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.600
Do it for her.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.960
Do it for your sister.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.880
Do not speak of my sister.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.440
What's wrong?

32:04.440 --> 32:06.600
What are you scared of?

32:06.600 --> 32:08.120
Hmm?

32:08.120 --> 32:10.000
The other witch would have done it.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.720
She wouldn't have hesitated.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.440
I am not Ruta.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.680
And I will not do this.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.200
Well, if you won't do it
out of anger...

32:23.240 --> 32:26.360
..then, please, just do it
out of mercy.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.080
My heart is heavy, too.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.120
I don't understand it.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.760
It makes no sense.

32:36.840 --> 32:40.640
Love makes us fragile
in ways we cannot fathom.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.600
I didn't love Lyra.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.400
I wasn't able to.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.640
Incapable of it.
You know, too warped.

32:57.520 --> 33:01.200
Even my own daemon rejects me.

33:03.640 --> 33:07.120
The way you feel right now
is proof you did love her.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.920
I understand more than you know.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.280
I lost my boy.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.520
A long time ago.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.360
Lyra gave me hope again.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.920
She would change the world.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.720
Defeat death.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.560
Become Eve.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.800
And now it won't happen.

33:32.800 --> 33:36.640
You know, when I first heard
that prophecy, it terrified me.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.080
Why?

33:40.120 --> 33:42.360
Because I was always
taught to believe

33:42.360 --> 33:47.040
that Eve was guilty
of something shameful.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.960
The Magisterium teach
the Fall is the birth of sin

33:49.960 --> 33:52.400
because they fear the unknown.

33:52.400 --> 33:56.160
All Eve did was dare to experience.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.240
It's an act of bravery.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.920
Of great beauty.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.600
You were a monster.

34:09.160 --> 34:11.680
But look what experience did to you.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.880
What love did.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.760
It changed you.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.880
LYRA GASPS
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS

34:51.880 --> 34:53.760
Are you OK?  Yeah.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.280
I thought you were gone.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.560
Me too.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.760
GURGLING BREATH

35:11.960 --> 35:13.440
It saved you.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.480
WHEEZES AND GURGLES

35:35.000 --> 35:36.720
Excuse me?

35:43.200 --> 35:45.120
I'd like to give you something
to thank you.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.320
What?

35:48.400 --> 35:50.480
A name.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.880
Names can't just be given!

35:52.880 --> 35:54.840
Mine was.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.320
By a friend.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.640
Gracious Wings.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.760
ROARING

36:09.560 --> 36:11.640
If you like it.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.160
You can't take it back now.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.000
Could you tell us, please...

36:22.440 --> 36:23.880
..Gracious Wings...

36:25.720 --> 36:27.680
..are we going the right way?

36:27.680 --> 36:29.600
We need to reach the highest point.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.760
That way!

36:36.800 --> 36:38.320
Thank you.

36:38.320 --> 36:42.440
You cannot tell the story of
my name if you do not get out.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.080
You like stories, don't you?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.600
True ones.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.360
GASPING

36:49.360 --> 36:53.280
True stories are nourishing.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.760
They feed us.

36:56.760 --> 37:02.080
We had no idea there was anything
but lies and wickedness.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.000
If those who follow behind
tell you everything they saw

37:05.000 --> 37:07.640
in the world, everything true,

37:07.640 --> 37:10.440
could you guide them here so they
could be set free?

37:10.440 --> 37:12.520
ROARING

37:14.320 --> 37:17.120
Do not lie to me.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.000
I won't.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.160
Do we have a deal?

37:27.160 --> 37:30.560
The prisoners' safe passage
in exchange for their stories.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.960
Liars cannot pass!

37:43.240 --> 37:44.480
It's all right.

37:44.480 --> 37:46.560
They're going to help us.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.840
Just tell them your stories,

37:48.840 --> 37:52.400
stories from your lives,
and they'll guide you up.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.600
Tell them stories.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.240
GHOSTS RELAY INSTRUCTIONS

37:59.240 --> 38:01.040
This way!

38:03.480 --> 38:05.200
That was genius.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.040
ASRIEL: Marisa?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.920
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

38:19.320 --> 38:21.240
Lyra's alive.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.920
She entered the land of
the dead of her own free will

38:23.920 --> 38:25.920
to rescue the kitchen boy.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.800
Don't do this.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.840
This is your guilt talking.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.800
Some kind of prison purgatory.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.960
They cut their way in
using the knife.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.240
But I saw the knife break.

38:37.240 --> 38:40.360
It was mended by Iorek Byrnison.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.320
He told me so himself.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.080
It makes sense.

38:44.080 --> 38:48.000
The Authority cows us with
the threat of heaven or hell.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.400
But even that was a lie.
It's all purgatory.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.280
I'm not interested in your theories.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.880
What proof do you have?

39:08.040 --> 39:11.240
You know as well as I do
that the panserbjorn cannot lie.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.240
Marisa, she's alive.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.320
Don't lie to me.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.240
Don't.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.040
HE CHUCKLES She's alive!

39:28.040 --> 39:31.080
And she's coming here when she
frees her friend Roger.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.880
Please.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.880
My heart won't take it.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.520
You said yourself.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.840
She's extraordinary.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.120
To free a soul...

39:43.360 --> 39:45.520
..from the land of the dead.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.840
HE CHUCKLES

39:49.680 --> 39:51.440
The witches' prophecy.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.760
They believe two things about Lyra.

39:55.760 --> 39:59.280
That she is Eve
and that she will defeat death.

40:04.040 --> 40:06.120
That's what she's doing.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.680
SHE LAUGHS

40:08.920 --> 40:10.720
The prophecy is right.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.200
We must help her, Asriel.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.560
WHISTLING

40:49.920 --> 40:51.400
SIGNAL WHISTLED

40:56.480 --> 40:59.400
William, we've been waiting for you.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.360
There's someone
who wants to see you.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.000
You're here.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.760
I haven't done what you said.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.440
I haven't taken the knife to Asriel.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.360
You know, you said I was a warrior,

42:02.360 --> 42:04.680
that I can't fight my nature.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.760
I think you were wrong.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.200
I hate fighting.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.640
I'm not who you want me to be.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.920
No.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.120
No, you're so much more.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.880
GHOSTS CONVERSE QUIETLY

42:50.040 --> 42:51.400
He'll be OK.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.280
He's lucky to have you
worrying about him.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.440
I don't know about that.

42:58.440 --> 43:01.640
Look at how you tamed
that thing back there.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.920
You've always been so...

43:05.120 --> 43:07.040
..brave.

43:07.040 --> 43:09.200
Reckless, more like.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.800
It was the stories that tamed her.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.280
Our stories.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.560
We have a lot of memories.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.240
We do.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.680
All this time...

43:26.960 --> 43:28.720
..I thought that...

43:30.120 --> 43:32.120
..when we eventually found
each other,

43:32.120 --> 43:35.040
we could go back to Oxford together.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.160
I did, too.

43:44.520 --> 43:47.240
What do you think's going
to happen if we make it out?

43:50.720 --> 43:52.000
I don't know.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.040
But we'll get out
of this awful place.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.680
We won't be going the same way.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.400
I always thought you were brave.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.600
Much braver than me.

44:22.880 --> 44:24.160
JOPARI: Do you have any idea

44:24.160 --> 44:26.960
what a remarkable thing
you did coming here?

44:26.960 --> 44:29.440
It wasn't just me.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.960
It was Lyra's idea.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.800
Yes, the girl.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.200
Eve.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.200
I know about her.

44:38.960 --> 44:40.800
The two of you will set us free.

44:45.120 --> 44:48.200
I don't even know
if I can do anything.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.920
You know, I'm just...
I'm so tired and my chest is aching.

44:50.920 --> 44:52.960
Because you're away
from your daemon.

44:52.960 --> 44:56.520
Separation across worlds
weakens your bond, Will.

44:56.520 --> 44:58.120
She's pining for you.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.600
How do you know?

44:59.600 --> 45:03.560
I guided her to Asriel's republic.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.680
As soon as you release these ghosts,

45:05.680 --> 45:07.800
you must cut through
and find her, Will.

45:07.800 --> 45:10.280
She's vulnerable. Promise me.

45:10.280 --> 45:12.480
I will. I will, I swear.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.400
Good.

45:17.480 --> 45:20.600
Will, I want you to listen to me.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.600
Don't try to live in a world
that's not your own,

45:25.600 --> 45:27.960
no matter how tempting it may seem.

45:27.960 --> 45:29.720
You and your daemon...

45:31.520 --> 45:34.080
..you won't survive it.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.560
But you did.

45:35.560 --> 45:39.120
No, I felt it like an ache
every day.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.720
Don't make the same mistake
that I did.

45:42.920 --> 45:46.560
You deserve a full life...

45:49.520 --> 45:51.640
..with your mother.

45:53.560 --> 45:55.240
What will happen to you?

45:55.240 --> 45:58.200
The same as will happen to
every soul trapped down here.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.160
I'll be free.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.800
I'll be connected again
to every living thing.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.200
Thanks to you.

46:11.760 --> 46:13.760
I can't say goodbye to you again.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.320
Well, then don't say goodbye.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.520
I'm so proud of you, William.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.080
Go.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.120
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

47:16.120 --> 47:17.600
You all right?

47:18.880 --> 47:21.080
Yeah. I'm OK.

47:22.480 --> 47:23.960
We need to keep going.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.520
No daemon can enter
the land of the dead.

47:31.520 --> 47:32.840
If Lyra is there,

47:32.840 --> 47:35.160
then Pantalaimon will be
in the upper worlds.

47:35.160 --> 47:37.280
Lyra and Pan are separated?

47:37.280 --> 47:39.680
That means they're vulnerable.
They must be reunited.

47:39.680 --> 47:41.960
I'll send a regiment to look for
them right away.  No.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.600
It'll draw too much attention.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.400
Let me send Kaisa.

47:45.400 --> 47:48.080
Will you tell me the moment
you have news?

47:50.960 --> 47:55.240
If it is true and Lyra
is going to free the dead,

47:55.240 --> 47:58.440
she and Will would have
achieved something remarkable.

48:00.520 --> 48:01.960
Far beyond your rebellion.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.280
Lyra is your focus now.

48:06.280 --> 48:08.040
Do not fail her.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.960
We can't go any further.

48:57.200 --> 48:58.720
This is it.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.760
Come on.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.160
HE GASPS

49:28.120 --> 49:30.440
SLICING

49:41.440 --> 49:44.560
RUMBLING AND WHOOSHING

49:44.560 --> 49:46.400
HE GASPS

50:07.360 --> 50:09.160
Well, I'll be damned.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.880
It's paradise.

50:14.160 --> 50:16.200
What's going to happen
if we step through there?

50:17.720 --> 50:19.560
My dad said you'll be free.

50:19.560 --> 50:23.440
You'll drift apart,
but you'll be out in the open,

50:23.440 --> 50:25.600
connected with everything
that's alive.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.840
I'll go first.

50:39.400 --> 50:41.160
I'm going to miss you so much.

50:43.360 --> 50:45.680
You'll be OK.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.400
I know you will.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.760
You've saved your best friend.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.600
When you go back to Jordan...

50:57.440 --> 50:59.360
..go to the roof for me.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.360
OK.  Yeah?

51:16.720 --> 51:18.360
I'm ready.

51:53.040 --> 51:56.880
Every part of me is aching to be
part of the universe again.

52:04.120 --> 52:05.760
Hey.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.520
No need for that.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.160
It's OK.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.080
Thank you.

52:20.080 --> 52:21.720
Sir.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.760
You two take good care of each
other.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.680
I'm going to be with my Hester.

52:50.040 --> 52:52.200
DUST RUSTLES

52:57.400 --> 53:00.600
GHOSTS:  Tell them stories.
Tell them stories.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.920
If you tell them stories...

53:05.320 --> 53:08.400
ECHOING:  If you tell them stories...
If you tell them stories...

53:10.240 --> 53:12.640
OVERLAPPING GHOSTS' VOICES

53:44.000 --> 53:45.680
Lyra's alive.

53:49.480 --> 53:51.360
May I sit?

54:10.040 --> 54:12.120
It hurts when we're apart.

54:12.120 --> 54:13.840
SNORTS SOFTLY

54:14.960 --> 54:17.520
I pretend that it doesn't.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.920
And that first time
I sent you away...

54:27.600 --> 54:29.200
..it was awful.

54:33.760 --> 54:35.520
I don't know why I do it.

54:37.360 --> 54:39.840
At first, I think it was curiosity.

54:43.560 --> 54:45.480
But now it's become something else.

54:48.760 --> 54:52.360
A way to not feel what I can't bear.

55:01.160 --> 55:04.240
I used to think
that I was the strong one.

55:07.160 --> 55:09.320
But I was wrong.

55:11.520 --> 55:13.000
It was you...

55:14.480 --> 55:15.760
..all along.

55:23.200 --> 55:25.320
I am so very sorry.

55:28.520 --> 55:31.840
Please, come back to me.

56:06.880 --> 56:08.520
XAPHANIA:  It is time.

56:12.160 --> 56:15.200
The first prophecy
has been fulfilled.

56:19.480 --> 56:24.160
The girl and the boy have
succeeded in their quest.

56:24.160 --> 56:27.400
Asriel, do you hear that?

56:28.680 --> 56:30.280
It's Xaphania.

56:31.680 --> 56:34.720
Will and Lyra have released
the dead from their prison.

56:37.480 --> 56:38.800
All of them?

56:38.800 --> 56:41.280
Metatron's purgatory is broken.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.800
His control is weakened.

56:47.960 --> 56:50.880
So he will come at you
with everything he has.

56:53.960 --> 56:57.560
The final rebellion has begun.
