- Yes!

09:06.063 --> 09:08.196

- Of course I am!

09:08.231 --> 09:09.397
Does Marc know?

09:10.968 --> 09:12.710
Not yet.

09:12.730 --> 09:14.269
I'm just worried.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.122
- What, that he's gonna freak out?
- No, the opposite.

09:17.142 --> 09:19.875
Once he knows, he's definitely
gonna want to get back together.

09:19.910 --> 09:20.936
- So?
- So...

09:20.956 --> 09:22.977
I want him to come back
because he wants to,

09:23.012 --> 09:24.579
not because he feels obligated.

09:24.614 --> 09:26.214
I know I have to tell him soon,

09:26.249 --> 09:27.881
but until I figure out a way to do it,

09:27.917 --> 09:29.550
I'm just... I'm just gonna avoid him.

09:29.586 --> 09:31.319
Except for when you go
to his show tonight.

09:31.354 --> 09:34.322
He won't see me.
I'm gonna sit in the back.

09:34.357 --> 09:35.823
You cannot tell anyone.

09:35.858 --> 09:38.226
I haven't even told Lucy anything yet.

09:38.261 --> 09:39.359
Of course.

West Coast birthday party tonight.

10:28.719 --> 10:29.718
No. It's... [Sighs]

10:29.754 --> 10:31.620
It's just that it's
all about priorities, Kylie.

10:31.656 --> 10:33.256
We have so many clients at this point

10:33.291 --> 10:34.490

actually feels like work.

my photography jobs come in,

ever. You'll see.

11:12.828 --> 11:13.594

And Harry is okay with this?

11:18.533 --> 11:19.432
He is.

11:19.467 --> 11:20.978
He obviously wants me
to make up with Joss,

the wrong way, roomie,

any chance I had

11:32.645 --> 11:34.769
at having a relationship with Scott.

11:34.789 --> 11:36.946
He could have been the one.

I saw Lucy and Noel,

just dropped them off.

you guys were so good, I couldn't leave.

Also, I have a question
for you, Dr. Kim.

20:53.104 --> 20:57.562
How did you feel when you, uh,
decided to stop working last year?

20:57.597 --> 20:59.184
Are you thinking
of leaving your business?

I don't know what I'm
thinking. I just...

Yes and no.

21:11.655 --> 21:15.133
It was a strange feeling,
not knowing what was next.

21:15.153 --> 21:16.924
But I didn't look back.

21:16.960 --> 21:20.394
And the truth is, it was
obviously the right thing
