You wouldn't have put up
with that shit from me.

38:19.514 --> 38:22.256
You make your own decisions.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.303
But I am done with that guy.

38:26.739 --> 38:27.957
- All right.

38:38.577 --> 38:40.318
- Good night, Gracie girl.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.016
- When do you think
Bram's getting home?

38:43.059 --> 38:47.063
- Oh, I think he's probably got
to work late.

38:47.107 --> 38:50.153
- I think he has a girlfriend.

38:52.025 --> 38:54.462
- He's been talking
on the phone a lot lately.

38:54.506 --> 38:58.379
And he doesn't like talking
on the phone.

38:58.423 --> 38:59.989
- You're very smart.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.904
Good night. I love you.

39:01.948 --> 39:03.515
- Love you, too.
