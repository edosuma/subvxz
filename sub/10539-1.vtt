01:53.262 --> 01:57.174
I think this house
will be exactly right for you.

01:57.381 --> 02:01.932
That's what she said about all the wrong
ones she showed us yesterday!

02:03.101 --> 02:05.568
Isn't it rather isolated?

02:05.780 --> 02:08.692
Well, secluded, I'd say.

02:55.574 --> 02:59.088
- Are you sure it wasn't $1,000 a week?
- Quite sure.

02:59.293 --> 03:01.568
- Furnished?
- Indeed.

03:01.773 --> 03:04.685
- What's the catch?
- Catch, Mr Curtis?

03:04.893 --> 03:07.929
A bargain like that
wouldn't stay on the market.

03:08.133 --> 03:10.407
Maybe there's a ghost.

03:11.852 --> 03:15.446
What self-respecting English house
would be without one?

03:15.651 --> 03:21.283
Nonsense. The fact is Mrs Aylwood,
the owner, is a bit eccentric.

03:21.491 --> 03:24.607
She has no family left
and she needs the income,

03:24.810 --> 03:30.964
but she is quite sentimental about the
house and picky about who lives in it.

03:32.010 --> 03:35.206
Look around.
I'll nip to the cottage for the keys.

03:35.408 --> 03:38.003
- Is someone living there?
- Mrs Aylwood.

03:38.209 --> 03:43.965
I expect that's why she wants to make sure
the tenants are the right sort of people.

03:54.647 --> 03:59.162
If we live here, I'm gonna climb this
and go exploring in those woods.

03:59.366 --> 04:04.485
Leave a trail of pebbles so I can grab you
before the wicked witch eats you up.

04:04.685 --> 04:09.075
If she lives in a gingerbread house,
I'll eat it up. I'm starved!

04:28.122 --> 04:30.112
- What is it?
- Mrs Aylwood.

04:30.322 --> 04:34.952
- I've brought a lovely family to...
- You were told to notify me first.

04:35.161 --> 04:39.995
- I tried to reach you by telephone.
- I haven't left the house all day.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.232
Mrs Curtis writes
charming children's books,

04:45.440 --> 04:49.591
and Mrs Curtis is quite well-known
in American musical circles.

04:49.799 --> 04:55.157
Pianist and composer. He's here
to conduct one of his own operas.

04:57.359 --> 04:59.997
Mrs Aylwood, are you all right?

05:00.198 --> 05:02.473
I'll get the keys.

05:03.678 --> 05:07.386
They don't build houses like this any more.

05:07.597 --> 05:09.952
What we need is a little light.

05:12.956 --> 05:17.268
There's a large dining room
and the kitchen has full butler's pantry.

05:17.476 --> 05:21.867
The living room is just beyond
the music room. This way.

05:35.753 --> 05:38.221
That's a bit more cheery, isn't it?

05:43.473 --> 05:46.032
How long before lunch?

05:46.233 --> 05:49.144
You just had breakfast an hour ago.

05:54.711 --> 05:59.022
When you said opera,
I thought he was a serious musician.

06:01.471 --> 06:04.701
I have a very soft touch late at night.

06:10.949 --> 06:13.543
Come on, Jan. Let's go upstairs.

06:33.427 --> 06:38.500
I want that room. It's really neat,
and you can look right out at the woods.

06:55.463 --> 06:58.102
Did you hurt yourself?

07:00.743 --> 07:02.699
It's just a little cut.

07:03.742 --> 07:06.256
I thought...

07:06.462 --> 07:09.818
I thought I saw something
out there in the woods.

07:11.862 --> 07:14.136
What sort of person are you?

07:15.261 --> 07:18.059
It's hard to say. Just... average, I guess.

07:18.260 --> 07:22.412
Are you adventurous... and kind?

07:22.620 --> 07:25.088
Are you kind?

07:25.300 --> 07:27.574
I... try to be.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.735
And sensitive?

07:31.659 --> 07:34.013
Do you sense things?

07:34.659 --> 07:39.448
Mrs Aylwood, my husband would like
to talk about the details of the lease.

07:39.658 --> 07:42.809
That is, if you've decided
to let us live here.

07:44.337 --> 07:47.295
I'm going to take a chance on you.

07:53.536 --> 07:55.527
Isn't this a pretty room?

07:57.576 --> 08:00.454
- What was all that about?
- I don't know.

08:00.655 --> 08:02.930
What happened to your hand?

08:03.135 --> 08:05.329
I cut it on that window.

08:05.535 --> 08:07.490
Let's see.

08:09.014 --> 08:11.847
- Mom?
- What, darling?

08:12.054 --> 08:16.251
- Couldn't we keep looking?
- This place has everything we need.

08:16.453 --> 08:21.891
- And the price is right. Why don't you like it?
- I don't know.

08:23.692 --> 08:26.684
The whole atmosphere, I guess.

08:28.492 --> 08:32.325
I had such a funny, cold feeling
out by the woods.

08:33.571 --> 08:36.085
Like someone was watching me.

08:38.211 --> 08:43.443
And then there's Mrs Aylwood...
and this house.

08:43.649 --> 08:48.006
Older people, when they live alone,
tend to be a bit unusual.

08:51.328 --> 08:53.479
Something awful happened here.

08:56.688 --> 08:58.644
I can feel it.

08:59.728 --> 09:01.684
Something awful.

09:06.767 --> 09:09.645
Boy, Mrs Aylwood sure is creepy.

09:18.365 --> 09:21.562
Comforting to know
we're the right sort of people.

09:21.765 --> 09:25.360
I've seen the iciest of old ladies
melted by your charm.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.681
- I think your daughter did the trick.
- Me?

09:28.884 --> 09:30.840
No, dear, not you.

09:32.564 --> 09:35.237
She had a daughter, about your age.

09:36.364 --> 09:39.594
- Had?
- Lost, many years ago.

09:40.763 --> 09:45.040
- Perhaps you reminded Mrs Aylwood of her.
- Lost how?

09:45.242 --> 09:50.077
I really don't know all the details,
just that she disappeared.

09:50.281 --> 09:53.432
I believe the circumstances
were rather tragic.

10:12.719 --> 10:14.869
She's going to stay here.

10:17.798 --> 10:19.948
Is that what you wanted?

10:27.236 --> 10:31.991
Let's see. Gooseneck lamp
up here with the rest of my writing things,

10:32.196 --> 10:34.471
mirror in the living room, please.

11:43.708 --> 11:47.221
- Jan, you didn't!
- I don't know what happened.

11:47.427 --> 11:49.577
I wasn't even touching it!

11:50.666 --> 11:55.342
Mom, I couldn't see myself in it.
My reflection wasn't in it.

11:55.546 --> 11:56.819
What?

11:57.026 --> 12:00.381
I couldn't see myself in the mirror.

12:00.585 --> 12:03.099
And then I saw...

12:03.304 --> 12:08.332
I thought I saw... somebody else in it.

12:09.704 --> 12:15.097
You know how old mirrors are. I never made
a move without something getting broken.

12:15.303 --> 12:17.418
That's seven years' bad luck.

12:17.623 --> 12:21.138
Nonsense. I broke a mirror
the day I met your mother.

12:21.343 --> 12:24.220
I'm not sure that makes your
point, darling.

12:27.502 --> 12:30.380
It's OK, Dad, I'll get it.

12:30.581 --> 12:32.537
Well, be careful.

12:48.499 --> 12:49.931
Boo!

12:50.139 --> 12:52.891
- Boy, are you ever jumpy!
- Brat!

12:53.979 --> 12:59.813
Look out! You'll wreck the scariest mask I
ever had! I may want to use it on you again.

13:00.018 --> 13:03.134
- Out!
- Some people are no fun at all.

13:03.337 --> 13:07.773
What is going on?
You are supposed to be in bed.

13:07.977 --> 13:12.492
- I was just attacked by that thing.
- Even monsters have to sleep.

13:12.696 --> 13:14.651
Here. Give us a kiss.

13:21.095 --> 13:23.051
- Goodnight.
- 'Night.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.329
Goodnight.

13:30.334 --> 13:32.289
- Sweet dreams.
- You, too.

13:34.933 --> 13:38.289
Mom, will you catch the light?
I'm through reading.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.002
Door.

14:49.804 --> 14:51.759
Must open door.

14:52.603 --> 14:54.321
Door.

14:56.843 --> 14:58.798
Must open door.

14:59.762 --> 15:02.640
Ellie? Ellie, wake up. It's OK.

15:02.842 --> 15:05.879
Ellie, wake up. You were dreaming.

15:06.081 --> 15:08.595
Talking in your sleep. It's OK.

15:10.321 --> 15:14.154
- I wasn't talking. You were.
- No, I wasn't.

15:19.640 --> 15:23.838
Well, you're the only one here.
Who else could it have been?

15:45.517 --> 15:48.350
Jan, can I come into bed with you?

15:48.556 --> 15:53.504
Sure. Then if we talk in our sleep,
we won't wake each other up. Make sense?

15:53.715 --> 15:56.355
No, but I'm coming anyways.

15:56.555 --> 16:02.424
I'll bring Arthur. He'll watch out for us.
Elephants hardly ever sleep, you know.

16:23.791 --> 16:25.942
Mike, you were right.

16:26.152 --> 16:29.700
This one chose me,
so I'd better not hurt its feelings.

16:29.911 --> 16:34.063
It came right away from the mother.
That means she's brave, huh?

16:34.271 --> 16:38.388
- What are you gonna call her?
- I'm not sure. I've gotta think.

16:38.590 --> 16:41.946
She's special,
so it's gotta be a special name.

17:39.582 --> 17:42.016
What's that?

17:42.222 --> 17:44.452
The name of the puppy: Nerak!

17:45.862 --> 17:50.252
- But what does it mean?
- You oughta know. You whispered it to me.

17:50.461 --> 17:54.294
- I was talking to Mike.
- Well, I heard somebody say it.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.254
I've never seen you write like that.

17:58.459 --> 18:01.337
Ring up and Mike will
deliver what you need.

18:01.540 --> 18:07.215
That's marvelous. When I'm working, it's hard
to tear myself away from the typewriter.

18:07.419 --> 18:12.014
He can pick things up for you in the
village. He's a good lad, my Mike.

18:12.218 --> 18:17.338
My strong right arm since his dad died.
I wanted him to stay at college, but...

18:19.218 --> 18:21.935
Mrs Fleming? What's wrong?

18:22.137 --> 18:27.608
Nothing. I... I just remembered
I left something cooking. Excuse me.

18:29.536 --> 18:34.211
Look, Mom! Isn't she beautiful?
Her name's Nerak.

18:36.095 --> 18:38.131
We've never known a Karen.

18:38.335 --> 18:42.931
Look, this may not be any of my business.
You want to talk about it?

18:43.134 --> 18:45.329
Jan, we're ready to go now.

18:45.534 --> 18:48.970
I can't. Not now, anyway.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.128
Karen!

19:09.171 --> 19:11.526
Come on, Nerak! Come on.

19:13.090 --> 19:16.480
Come here, Nerak. Come on!

19:16.690 --> 19:18.646
Come on.

19:29.528 --> 19:31.484
Come on, Nerak! Come on.

19:33.688 --> 19:35.644
Come on, come on!

19:38.167 --> 19:40.203
Come on. Come on.

19:40.407 --> 19:42.363
No!

19:44.327 --> 19:47.204
Come on, come on. Come here, Nerak.

19:55.685 --> 19:57.641
- Bye!
- Bye!

20:23.002 --> 20:24.480
Ellie?

20:31.760 --> 20:33.352
Ellie?

20:36.400 --> 20:38.151
Ellie?

21:45.191 --> 21:46.544
Ellie?

21:50.071 --> 21:52.300
Ellie, can you hear me?

22:08.308 --> 22:10.026
Ellie!

22:16.027 --> 22:18.495
Ellie, please!

22:33.265 --> 22:36.302
Ellie, why didn't you answer
when I called you?

22:36.504 --> 22:41.100
I didn't hear you. And you shouldn't
sneak up like that. You scared me.

22:41.304 --> 22:44.296
- I was yelling myself hoarse!
- I didn't hear.

22:44.504 --> 22:48.894
- I asked you not to come into the woods!
- I had to. Nerak ran off.

22:49.103 --> 22:52.618
If I hadn't come after her,
she would have gotten lost.

23:00.822 --> 23:03.655
Isn't this a pretty place?

23:04.461 --> 23:05.735
Yeah.

23:10.701 --> 23:12.850
Yes, it is.

23:16.780 --> 23:20.567
- That's a happy song.
- What?

23:20.779 --> 23:22.815
The song you were just humming.

23:24.459 --> 23:26.414
I wasn't humming anything.

23:28.259 --> 23:30.214
Come here, Nerak.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.488
- Did you see that?
- See what?

23:34.697 --> 23:38.451
All I can see is this vicious animal
trying to smother me!

23:49.176 --> 23:52.292
- We should head back.
- Tell that to Nerak.

23:52.495 --> 23:55.612
- I mean it! Now!
- Come back, you little...

23:59.415 --> 24:00.688
Jan!

24:08.493 --> 24:10.722
- No!
- Let go of me!

24:10.933 --> 24:13.890
- Stop! You're drowning her!
- Let me go!

24:15.012 --> 24:17.480
- Stop!
- Get out of my way!

24:34.570 --> 24:40.326
She had to. She had to push you down
to get you loose from the branch.

24:40.529 --> 24:42.485
She saved your life.

24:46.448 --> 24:49.724
- I thought she was trying to drown you.
- Ellie...

24:49.928 --> 24:53.442
Go and fetch some dry clothes
for your sister.

24:54.847 --> 24:57.407
Yes, ma'am. Come on, Nerak.

24:59.327 --> 25:02.602
Dry your hair or you'll take a chill.

25:04.606 --> 25:07.882
I don't know how to
thank you for saving me.

25:08.086 --> 25:12.681
What kind of name is that? Nerak?

25:12.885 --> 25:18.039
Ellie just made that up.
It's the name Karen spelled backwards.

25:22.924 --> 25:25.722
What is it? What's wrong?

25:25.923 --> 25:30.838
That was my daughter's name. Karen.

25:38.682 --> 25:43.038
Mrs Thayer told us
you'd lost your daughter. I'm sorry.

25:44.841 --> 25:46.796
Drink this.

25:49.201 --> 25:51.191
- Mrs Aylwood?
- Yes?

25:51.400 --> 25:54.631
Was anything wrong with Karen's eyes?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.876
Why do you ask?

25:57.079 --> 26:02.073
The night she disappeared...
was she blindfolded?

26:05.399 --> 26:08.595
How do you know about the blindfold?

26:09.798 --> 26:13.312
You asked me once if I sensed things.

26:13.518 --> 26:17.795
Well, I have.
And Ellie's been hearing things.

26:17.996 --> 26:21.272
It's like someone is watching us.

26:21.477 --> 26:25.469
- And the day we moved in, I saw something.
- What?

26:26.876 --> 26:29.264
An image in a mirror.

26:30.715 --> 26:36.710
A girl... about my age...
with long blonde hair.

26:38.154 --> 26:40.509
And she was blindfolded.

26:42.433 --> 26:45.824
- You saw her?
- I'm not sure.

26:49.593 --> 26:52.902
Could you...
Could you tell me what happened?

26:54.032 --> 26:55.987
How she disappeared?

26:59.151 --> 27:04.464
My husband was killed in the war.

27:05.951 --> 27:08.908
And Karen was everything to me.

27:10.350 --> 27:12.864
She was soon to be 17,

27:14.549 --> 27:19.384
and I stayed up late...
finishing her present.

27:24.469 --> 27:26.698
Karen wasn't in her room.

27:26.908 --> 27:29.547
She was always so considerate,

27:29.747 --> 27:33.627
I couldn't believe
she'd gone off without telling me.

27:33.827 --> 27:39.696
Then I remembered there was an eclipse. She
might have gone to watch it at the pond.

27:39.906 --> 27:41.862
Karen?

27:42.066 --> 27:44.341
Karen, where are you?

28:02.104 --> 28:04.664
Mary! John!

28:06.063 --> 28:08.941
Tom? Tom Colley!

28:11.302 --> 28:12.701
Karen?

28:22.341 --> 28:23.694
Karen!

28:24.741 --> 28:26.696
Karen!

28:31.700 --> 28:37.490
They searched the ruins...
but there was no sign of Karen.

28:38.699 --> 28:40.655
No sign at all.

28:40.858 --> 28:44.214
Didn't the other kids
know what happened to her?

28:46.538 --> 28:49.177
Why was she blindfolded?

28:49.377 --> 28:53.768
They said it was part of a game.

28:54.657 --> 28:56.807
They used to meet in the chapel.

29:05.295 --> 29:09.811
Sometimes there seems to be
something out there.

29:11.415 --> 29:17.808
Sometimes... I hear someone
whispering in the wind.

29:19.054 --> 29:22.729
Mrs Aylwood, what do you think
happened to Karen?

29:27.413 --> 29:29.721
I think she's still out there.

29:31.172 --> 29:34.403
- What nonsense.
- I told you there was a ghost.

29:34.612 --> 29:38.240
As long as it keeps out of the house,
I can live with it.

29:38.451 --> 29:42.922
For heaven's sake! I knew Mrs Aylwood
was strange, but this is ridiculous.

29:43.131 --> 29:47.487
I did see something in the mist
at the pond. That's why I fell in.

29:47.690 --> 29:50.602
We'll always be grateful
to her for saving you,

29:50.810 --> 29:55.564
but I won't have her filling your head
with these far-fetched fantasies.

29:57.689 --> 29:59.281
Excuse me.

30:08.488 --> 30:12.036
- I'll catch you later. I want to watch Mike.
- OK.

30:12.247 --> 30:13.965
She seems less moody today.

30:14.167 --> 30:19.115
This is what she needs. It'll do her good.

30:19.326 --> 30:23.444
- How many sandwiches do we have?
- Four for me and one for you!

30:39.803 --> 30:41.123
Come on!

30:43.203 --> 30:45.717
Come on, Mike!

30:53.442 --> 30:55.272
- Hi, guys!
- Hi.

30:55.481 --> 30:58.632
Grab a sandwich
before your sister eats them all.

30:58.841 --> 31:00.797
Ellie, let's get closer.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.709
Well, be careful now.

31:20.639 --> 31:22.914
- There he is!
- There's Mike!

31:55.994 --> 31:57.950
Jan! Come quick!

31:58.154 --> 31:59.985
What is it?

32:02.913 --> 32:04.312
Quickly!

32:07.073 --> 32:09.143
Jan, quickly!

32:17.992 --> 32:20.824
Wow! Did you see that?

32:23.071 --> 32:27.063
- What did you want?
- I didn't want you. Nerak did.

32:37.669 --> 32:41.378
- It's lucky you moved off that rock.
- It wasn't luck.

32:41.589 --> 32:45.102
- What do you mean?
- It's nothing. Forget it.

32:45.308 --> 32:50.665
- It's just been a crazy kind of week all round.
- Do you want to talk about it?

32:51.587 --> 32:56.945
Mrs Aylwood told me that Karen,
her daughter, disappeared years ago,

32:57.146 --> 33:00.536
when she was about my age,
and was never seen again.

33:00.746 --> 33:07.298
If Karen was murdered, that would explain
her haunting the woods, wouldn't it?

33:07.505 --> 33:11.498
Mrs Aylwood said there were three kids
with Karen that night.

33:11.704 --> 33:16.334
One was John Keller,
and there was a Tom something. Collier?

33:16.544 --> 33:21.220
Tom Colley. He lives in the woods
in the old lodge. Kind of a hermit.

33:21.423 --> 33:26.655
And there was a girl. Mary... Mary Pierce.

33:28.742 --> 33:31.381
- Mary Pierce?
- Yeah.

33:31.582 --> 33:34.938
That was my mother's name
before she married Dad.

33:36.541 --> 33:40.295
It was a long time ago.
It's best forgotten.

33:40.501 --> 33:45.130
- How come you never told me?
- It happened years before you were born.

33:45.340 --> 33:50.778
I remember your dad saying it's important
to live in the present and leave the past.

33:50.979 --> 33:54.415
There's something about those woods
that bothers you.

33:54.619 --> 33:59.135
You never go near them, not even to
take the short cut to the village.

33:59.338 --> 34:03.570
Across that rickety old bridge?
I should say not.

34:03.778 --> 34:07.531
Mum, what do you think
really happened to Karen Aylwood?

34:11.016 --> 34:13.929
I think she ran away from home.

34:15.217 --> 34:19.494
I don't know why she did,
but it's the only logical explanation.

34:23.735 --> 34:25.965
What were the four of you doing?

34:28.775 --> 34:33.165
We were just... just larking about.

34:35.654 --> 34:37.609
It was John Keller's idea.

34:39.373 --> 34:41.934
It was... just a game.

34:44.532 --> 34:48.367
Then there was a... sudden summer storm.

34:50.572 --> 34:53.563
Lightning struck the belfry.

34:53.772 --> 34:56.683
The whole thing was aflame.

35:01.011 --> 35:03.570
We ran out.

35:03.771 --> 35:06.841
At least... three of us did.

35:11.929 --> 35:14.887
I've never been back to that place again.

35:20.408 --> 35:24.083
Look what Daddy made me
to watch the eclipse on Saturday.

35:24.288 --> 35:28.758
- I can show you how to make one.
- Not now. Mike's taking us riding.

35:28.967 --> 35:31.116
I'll get ready.

35:37.446 --> 35:40.994
- Mom said she'd only be a minute.
- That means ten.

35:41.966 --> 35:45.037
- I wish you didn't have to go.
- So do I.

35:45.245 --> 35:49.557
But if I don't, singers, dancers
and musicians will be unemployed.

35:49.765 --> 35:53.279
- Jan, I'll be back in time for supper.
- OK.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.476
- See if you can find some peanut butter.
- Crunchy or smooth?

35:57.684 --> 35:59.834
- Smooth!
- Crunchy!

36:00.044 --> 36:02.716
OK, I'll handle it. Have a good ride.

36:02.923 --> 36:04.561
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:09.922 --> 36:11.878
- Bye!
- Bye!

36:42.918 --> 36:47.672
Good riding, Ellie. Ride ahead
and make sure the path's clear of Indians.

36:47.877 --> 36:52.631
It gets me out of the way so you two
can be alone, doesn't it? See you.

36:54.156 --> 36:56.716
Come on. Come on, Snowball. Let's go.

36:58.356 --> 37:00.711
I tried to talk to Mum about Karen.

37:01.835 --> 37:06.351
She was very evasive. She really
didn't want to talk about it at all.

37:14.634 --> 37:16.989
Come on, you guys. Hurry up!

37:20.353 --> 37:22.308
Let go back through the woods.

37:23.312 --> 37:27.191
- No, Mike, I don't think we should.
- Oh, come on!

37:37.871 --> 37:40.100
Help! Help me!

37:49.869 --> 37:52.463
Help! Mike, help!

38:10.307 --> 38:13.059
- Stop, Snowball!
- Hang on!

38:20.665 --> 38:23.054
Cocoa! Help!

38:23.265 --> 38:25.779
Mike! Help!

38:26.984 --> 38:29.259
Stop! Cocoa, stop!

38:34.624 --> 38:36.580
Cocoa!

38:56.701 --> 38:58.656
Anybody there?

39:01.581 --> 39:03.855
Is anyone in there?

40:13.451 --> 40:15.009
Mike!

40:21.930 --> 40:23.204
Are you OK?

40:23.410 --> 40:26.719
- That man!
- It was Tom Colley. He didn't hurt you?

40:26.929 --> 40:32.287
I saw Karen's face again!
In the chapel. In a coffin!

40:42.328 --> 40:44.557
It's only a reflection.

40:44.767 --> 40:48.601
It couldn't have been my reflection.
I wasn't standing here.

40:48.807 --> 40:53.118
I was back there. It was Karen, her image.

40:53.326 --> 40:56.681
She was lying in that coffin
as if she were dead.

40:57.765 --> 41:00.154
I think I was sent here for a reason.

41:00.365 --> 41:04.677
You were on a runaway horse.
He could have bolted in any direction.

41:04.885 --> 41:08.639
He bolted because
something in the woods spooked him.

41:08.844 --> 41:10.800
Don't build it up into a...

41:13.404 --> 41:14.678
Mike!

41:35.441 --> 41:38.160
What made the windows break?

41:38.360 --> 41:42.717
The wind. It just came
blasting through the chapel.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.275
But there wasn't any wind outside.

41:51.399 --> 41:55.073
Overlapping circles. What does it mean?

42:01.157 --> 42:05.435
- Can't we go now, Jan?
- Sure we can, Ellie. Come on, Jan.

42:05.637 --> 42:11.472
Mike. There was a shadow of a triangle
on this coffin when I came in.

42:11.677 --> 42:15.555
The same triangle
that's on the window in my bedroom.

42:15.755 --> 42:19.988
These circles, they must mean something.

42:21.515 --> 42:24.871
There was a circle
on the water at the pond, too.

42:26.075 --> 42:28.190
It was strange.

42:35.633 --> 42:40.229
I've seen her, Mr Keller.
As God's my witness, I've seen her.

42:41.153 --> 42:44.384
- She was in the chapel, she was.
- You're drunk.

42:44.593 --> 42:46.981
Not then, I wasn't.

42:47.192 --> 42:48.989
She was there, I tell you.

42:49.191 --> 42:54.549
She come in and went right to the coffin
and looked inside.

42:54.751 --> 42:58.106
- That's impossible.
- Listen!

42:59.230 --> 43:01.186
It's thundering.

43:02.030 --> 43:06.227
There was thunder and lightning
that other night. The night we...

43:06.430 --> 43:09.944
Now, I've told you
never to talk about that night!

43:10.149 --> 43:15.587
All that time gone by, and her looking
like it was yesterday it happened.

43:16.428 --> 43:21.421
- How could that be?
- Get hold of yourself, man!

43:22.707 --> 43:26.177
It's been nearly 30 years.

43:26.627 --> 43:31.905
Now, none of us could look the same,
could we?

43:35.625 --> 43:36.944
There.

43:46.345 --> 43:48.653
What was it I seen, then?

43:49.864 --> 43:54.618
Has she come back from the grave
to haunt us for what we done, Mr Keller?

43:55.383 --> 43:57.613
Is it the ghost of Karen I seen?

44:03.382 --> 44:05.338
Works every time!

44:24.459 --> 44:27.815
We should bring Ellie.
It might curb her appetite.

45:26.211 --> 45:29.123
- What took you so long?
- I saw her again.

45:29.331 --> 45:32.368
- What are you talking about?
- In the mirrors.

45:32.571 --> 45:37.405
She was reaching out, begging me,
pleading with me to help her.

45:37.651 --> 45:41.325
- She's trapped and needs my help.
- Oh, come on, Jan!

45:41.570 --> 45:45.323
- It means something, Mike.
- You're not making sense.

45:45.529 --> 45:47.997
There's something I've got to do.

45:48.209 --> 45:52.645
Maybe she wants me to find out
what really happened that night.

45:52.848 --> 45:58.206
- How?
- I don't know, but I've got to find out.

46:46.641 --> 46:48.120
Stay!

46:48.322 --> 46:53.395
Didn't you see the signs?
This is private property!

46:53.601 --> 46:57.992
Mr Keller, I had to see you.
It's about Karen Aylwood.

46:59.640 --> 47:03.473
- What about Karen Aylwood?
- She needs help.

47:05.359 --> 47:09.351
- How would you know that?
- I've seen her.

47:09.558 --> 47:11.435
- Where?
- In mirrors.

47:15.238 --> 47:19.709
Mirrors. You see yourself as Karen?

47:19.917 --> 47:22.750
No! It was her image!

47:24.837 --> 47:30.468
Why was she blindfolded in the chapel?
I've gotta know what happened that night!

47:30.676 --> 47:35.466
Why do you? You're a stranger here.
It's none of your business.

47:36.235 --> 47:40.785
Don't you see? She needs my help.
She's trapped somewhere...

47:40.994 --> 47:46.273
That's enough. I've better things to do
than listen to hysterical fantasies.

47:46.474 --> 47:50.102
What happened to Karen
was a tragedy that touched us all,

47:50.313 --> 47:52.908
changed us all, but it's best forgotten!

47:53.113 --> 47:56.583
- Have you ever forgotten?
- Get out of here!

47:56.793 --> 48:00.262
- Mr Keller, please.
- I said, clear out.

49:52.578 --> 49:54.136
Tom Colley?

49:55.057 --> 49:56.377
Tom Colley?

50:58.329 --> 51:01.720
Please, don't be angry.
I didn't mean to come inside.

51:01.930 --> 51:04.568
I called but nobody answered!

51:12.488 --> 51:17.038
- You ain't no ghost.
- I'm the girl you saw in the chapel.

51:18.767 --> 51:21.997
You ain't Karen come back to haunt us.

51:25.646 --> 51:27.602
Why would she do that?

51:29.566 --> 51:35.356
Can't talk about that.
Mr Keller, he said not to.

51:41.605 --> 51:45.597
Nasty poacher hurt its paw,
but old Tom'll make it right.

51:47.364 --> 51:49.319
Like he did for you, eh?

51:50.563 --> 51:52.758
Nearly right now, ain't you?

51:56.242 --> 51:58.915
Not like them poor little ones there.

51:59.122 --> 52:03.559
When I finds 'em like that, dead,
I buries 'em.

52:04.601 --> 52:08.799
Tom, was Karen dead when you found her?

52:10.601 --> 52:13.956
Never found Karen. Looked and looked.

52:15.960 --> 52:18.474
Here. Hold.

52:20.320 --> 52:24.198
It won't hurt you none.
They know when you try to help.

52:30.518 --> 52:33.828
- Karen needs your help, Tom.
- Needs me?

52:35.158 --> 52:37.193
Yes, she needs you.

52:37.397 --> 52:39.627
But Karen's gone.

52:41.357 --> 52:47.147
- Tom, if you knew Karen was trapped...
- Awful things, traps. They hurt.

52:48.916 --> 52:52.828
- You'd set her free, wouldn't you?
- If I could find her.

52:53.035 --> 52:59.508
You don't have to, Tom. All you have to do
is tell me what happened in the chapel.

53:02.234 --> 53:04.509
Why did you blindfold her?

53:07.713 --> 53:13.070
What was it you did?
You and Mary Pierce and John Keller?

53:14.073 --> 53:18.509
Mr Keller said mustn't talk about that.

53:22.831 --> 53:26.346
- Mary Pierce said you were playing a game.
- She said?

53:26.551 --> 53:29.349
Yes, Tom. What kind of game?

53:43.469 --> 53:46.266
Ring Round the Roses, it was.

53:48.028 --> 53:50.337
Never meant to harm Karen.

53:51.708 --> 53:55.461
Loved Karen. Wouldn't ever hurt her.

53:56.467 --> 53:58.423
There was three of us.

53:58.627 --> 54:04.781
Me and Mary made our way to the
secret meeting place, the old chapel.

54:04.987 --> 54:07.260
We had blindfolded Karen.

54:07.466 --> 54:13.017
That was what John Keller had told us
to do. She was the new one, you see.

54:13.226 --> 54:15.897
John Keller was already in there.

54:23.144 --> 54:28.854
You have been brought to this place to prove
yourself worthy of our secret society.

54:29.063 --> 54:33.340
We number only three. We alone
have passed this test of courage.

54:33.543 --> 54:36.056
Many have tried and failed.

54:37.782 --> 54:41.218
Once we link hands, you must not show fear,

54:41.422 --> 54:47.769
you must not speak, you must not remove
the blindfold, you must not move at all.

54:47.981 --> 54:53.374
We shall hold hands around you and you must
not break the circle of our friendship.

54:53.580 --> 54:57.970
Whatever happens, whatever we say or do,
you must abide by our code.

54:58.179 --> 55:01.888
Banish all thoughts from your mind.
Do you understand?

55:02.099 --> 55:04.055
Let us join hands...

55:07.538 --> 55:09.768
...and concentrate.

55:12.617 --> 55:17.327
Mary Pierce, Tom Colley and I, John Keller,

55:17.537 --> 55:22.372
we are looking upon you, Karen Aylwood,
willing you to be as one with us.

55:22.576 --> 55:27.047
We ask the question,
is this person worthy...

56:00.412 --> 56:02.481
She wasn't there any more.

56:03.651 --> 56:08.007
When the bell come down,
she was gone already.

56:08.211 --> 56:11.327
- Are you sure?
- I told 'em what I seen.

56:11.531 --> 56:15.842
"Where could she have gone?" they says.
There was no other way out.

56:16.050 --> 56:20.964
And they looked and looked...
and never found nothin'.

56:22.009 --> 56:23.965
Tom...

56:24.169 --> 56:26.363
Nice to me, she was.

56:27.888 --> 56:29.844
So nice.

56:30.847 --> 56:33.236
She was my friend.

56:43.926 --> 56:45.803
Ellie.

56:46.446 --> 56:49.039
Where'd you hear that song?

56:49.246 --> 56:53.999
From Jan. She was humming it at the pond
the day she fell in the water.

56:55.404 --> 57:01.036
Come in, child. There's something
I want to show you. I think you'll like it.

57:01.244 --> 57:05.282
- My mother said I was never to bother you.
- It's no bother.

57:05.484 --> 57:09.681
Come on. I was just about
to have some tea and cakes.

57:11.442 --> 57:13.034
OK!

57:37.720 --> 57:41.189
This belonged to my daughter.

57:42.318 --> 57:46.709
I gave it to her on her fifth birthday.
She loved it.

57:46.918 --> 57:51.036
She played it at night
before she went to sleep.

57:51.237 --> 57:55.708
It's the same tune you heard at the pond.

57:57.436 --> 57:58.790
Listen.

58:05.036 --> 58:09.028
Your sister tells me you hear...
other things.

58:10.155 --> 58:13.670
Voices that tell you to... do things?

58:14.755 --> 58:16.905
I was just dreaming.

58:17.115 --> 58:19.230
Not when you named Nerak.

58:19.434 --> 58:21.584
She named herself.

58:22.553 --> 58:25.863
Listen, child. Listen to the music.

58:26.913 --> 58:29.825
See if you can hear that voice again.

58:31.113 --> 58:33.786
- Mrs Aylwood.
- Hi, Jan.

58:33.992 --> 58:36.586
Look at the music box. Isn't it pretty?

58:36.792 --> 58:42.388
In a minute, Ellie. I've something to tell
Mrs Aylwood. I just came from Tom Colley's.

58:50.670 --> 58:53.980
He said it was some kind
of initiation ceremony.

58:54.190 --> 58:58.102
He said there was a flash of light,
just like you saw,

58:58.309 --> 59:01.585
but when the bell crashed,
Karen was already gone.

59:01.788 --> 59:03.984
There was no other way out.

59:04.189 --> 59:08.784
That's what Tom Colley said.
The bell crashed. Karen was already gone.

59:09.988 --> 59:13.583
Karen. Must help Karen.

59:16.227 --> 59:18.024
Must help.

59:18.226 --> 59:21.822
No! We must listen.

59:28.345 --> 59:30.779
How can we help Karen?

59:30.985 --> 59:34.944
Door. Must open door.

59:35.144 --> 59:38.500
- What door? Where?
- Chapel.

59:38.704 --> 59:43.174
Soon! Very soon! Help Karen very soon!

59:44.023 --> 59:46.696
Karen, tell us how.

59:46.903 --> 59:50.498
No, not Karen, but need help.

59:50.703 --> 59:55.617
- If you're not Karen, who are you?
- Tell me what to do, Karen, please!

59:55.822 --> 59:58.255
No! Not Karen!

59:58.461 --> 01:00:00.418
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:02.930
- Who are you?
- Ellie!

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:06.416
- What have you done to her?
- It just happened.

01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:09.896
I didn't want to hurt Ellie! I love her!

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.533
Mom?

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.374
Mom...

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:19.255
It's all right, baby.
Everything is gonna be all right now.

01:00:19.459 --> 01:00:24.249
I'm taking you out of here. I'm taking
both of you away from here tonight.

01:00:24.459 --> 01:00:28.690
No! You can't. Not now, Mom!

01:00:29.457 --> 01:00:34.247
It's not Karen outside there.
Don't you understand? It's someone else!

01:00:34.457 --> 01:00:38.051
You get your things ready.
We're leaving here right now.

01:01:07.613 --> 01:01:10.490
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

01:01:10.693 --> 01:01:14.241
- The battery's shorting.
- It's trying to stop us.

01:01:14.452 --> 01:01:16.408
Nothing's trying to stop us.

01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:25.723
- We must go back.
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:01:49.367 --> 01:01:53.918
- If we go back, they'll start again!
- Jan, stop it. Just stop it!

01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:04.559
- What are you doing?
- We have to get off the bridge!

01:02:04.766 --> 01:02:07.120
Come on! Get out!

01:02:13.604 --> 01:02:17.882
- Enough of this hysteria! Give me the keys!
- I can't!

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.554
Sorry she made you angry.

01:02:53.959 --> 01:02:56.519
You're not Karen. I know that.

01:02:58.518 --> 01:03:05.037
I don't know who you are,
but, please, leave my little sister alone.

01:03:05.238 --> 01:03:09.310
- Stop that.
- Mom, I can't. I can't stop!

01:03:09.518 --> 01:03:14.147
There's something I've got to do,
or Ellie and I'll go on being haunted!

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:17.348
Whatever is out there
won't tell me what it wants!

01:03:17.556 --> 01:03:19.831
Stop it this minute!

01:03:20.036 --> 01:03:21.389
Mom, I'm scared.

01:03:21.596 --> 01:03:26.350
Whatever it is out there,
it's not going to use you, either of you.

01:04:43.465 --> 01:04:45.980
Not Karen!

01:04:46.185 --> 01:04:48.141
We've got to hurry!

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.496
Nearly too late.

01:05:30.859 --> 01:05:34.374
- Hardly ever happens.
- What hardly ever happens?

01:05:39.299 --> 01:05:43.450
Ellie, you said it hardly ever happens.
What does it mean?

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:51.175
I don't know, Jan.

01:05:51.377 --> 01:05:53.332
I can't remember.

01:05:56.776 --> 01:05:59.131
"Do again tomorrow."

01:06:00.336 --> 01:06:02.292
Do what?

01:06:04.895 --> 01:06:06.851
I don't know.

01:06:10.135 --> 01:06:12.090
I'm scared.

01:06:27.892 --> 01:06:33.046
Good, you're up. Mom said not to wake you.
Seen my thing to watch the eclipse?

01:06:33.252 --> 01:06:34.970
No.

01:06:39.491 --> 01:06:43.881
Dad says you can't look straight at the sun
or it'll ruin your eyes.

01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:48.163
- I hope he gets here in time to see it.
- Daddy's coming?

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:52.806
Mom called him.
Help me look, Jan. It's nearly too late.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.840
Nearly too late.

01:06:55.049 --> 01:06:57.243
Here it is!

01:06:58.049 --> 01:07:01.723
That's funny. I looked in there before.

01:07:03.408 --> 01:07:06.923
We can all take turns using it.
It hardly ever happens.

01:07:07.127 --> 01:07:08.846
Hardly ever happens.

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:14.761
- What hardly ever happens?
- I just told you. The eclipse.

01:07:14.966 --> 01:07:19.357
There are lots of moon eclipses,
but a sun eclipse is special.

01:07:24.926 --> 01:07:26.961
What time does it start?

01:07:27.165 --> 01:07:29.803
12.30. Oh, rats!

01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:34.919
When Mike did this, it came out elephants,
not Ring Around the Rosey!

01:07:35.124 --> 01:07:37.432
Ring Round the Roses, it was.

01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:39.842
What's wrong?

01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:45.198
Nothing. Tell Mom I'm going back to sleep.

01:07:51.402 --> 01:07:54.041
- Hello?
- You gotta do something for me!

01:07:54.241 --> 01:07:58.393
- Jan, what's wrong?
- I think I know what those circles meant.

01:07:58.601 --> 01:08:03.550
- The overlapping ones meant an eclipse.
- There's an eclipse today.

01:08:03.761 --> 01:08:07.229
And the circle at the pond
meant a circle of people.

01:08:07.439 --> 01:08:11.796
I can't explain it all,
but I have to get Keller, Tom and your mom

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.638
to the chapel now before the eclipse.

01:08:14.838 --> 01:08:19.912
I need your help. Tell her anything.
Say it's a matter of life or death.

01:08:25.718 --> 01:08:27.116
Jan?

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:30.987
Where are you going?

01:08:31.197 --> 01:08:36.270
I'm going to the chapel with John Keller,
Tom Colley and Mary Fleming.

01:08:36.475 --> 01:08:40.468
I want them to repeat
the ceremony they held, linking hands,

01:08:40.676 --> 01:08:44.145
like in a seance
when people make objects move.

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:49.189
- I think that's what happened to Karen...
- No! You mustn't do that!

01:08:49.394 --> 01:08:54.229
Whatever happened to my Karen
could happen to you.

01:08:55.473 --> 01:08:57.669
Mrs Aylwood, I have to do it.

01:08:58.794 --> 01:09:02.911
Whatever is haunting Ellie and me
will never leave us alone.

01:09:15.792 --> 01:09:17.827
God be with you, child.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:25.585
- Karen Aylwood's dead!
- How do you know that?

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:29.385
She never would have put her mother
through suffering!

01:09:29.589 --> 01:09:32.706
Part of the suffering is not knowing.

01:09:32.908 --> 01:09:35.548
Maybe we can find out what happened,

01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:41.140
how she disappeared before the bell fell,
or how she died, if she died.

01:09:41.348 --> 01:09:45.100
I told you before,
it's none of your business.

01:09:45.308 --> 01:09:48.344
Mr Keller, it was your idea, wasn't it?

01:09:49.346 --> 01:09:52.975
The secret society?
The initiation ceremony?

01:09:53.185 --> 01:09:55.177
Don't you wanna know the truth?

01:09:56.826 --> 01:10:01.741
Who do you think you are to disrupt lives
and reopen old wounds?

01:10:01.945 --> 01:10:04.334
They never really healed, did they?

01:10:04.545 --> 01:10:08.333
Isn't that why you lock yourself away
in that dreary house,

01:10:08.545 --> 01:10:10.661
a prisoner of your own guilt?

01:10:10.864 --> 01:10:13.901
Mr Keller, I don't have much time.

01:10:14.103 --> 01:10:16.333
But you owe it to Karen

01:10:16.543 --> 01:10:21.378
and you owe it to yourself
to try to help make this happen.

01:10:29.341 --> 01:10:34.813
- They should have been here by now.
- They won't come. Not back to this place.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.059
But they are! They're coming!

01:11:06.497 --> 01:11:08.453
Nerak, look...

01:11:13.697 --> 01:11:15.652
Nerak, get over here!

01:11:18.336 --> 01:11:20.895
Nerak! Come back!

01:11:28.255 --> 01:11:30.688
- I can't.
- You must.

01:11:30.894 --> 01:11:34.364
We're running out of time.
We can't waste it arguing.

01:11:34.574 --> 01:11:37.565
It may not work, Mrs Fleming,
but we must try!

01:11:37.773 --> 01:11:39.923
We have to repeat the ceremony.

01:11:41.573 --> 01:11:43.085
No. No!

01:11:43.292 --> 01:11:47.331
Whatever happened 30 years ago
was during an eclipse.

01:11:47.532 --> 01:11:51.763
The same thing's happening now,
so maybe we can bring her back.

01:11:55.091 --> 01:11:56.649
Nerak!

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:00.004
Nerak!

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:02.085
Nerak!

01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:05.482
Nerak!

01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:08.964
Nerak!

01:12:12.928 --> 01:12:14.362
Nerak!

01:12:17.408 --> 01:12:18.841
Nerak.

01:12:35.206 --> 01:12:41.519
Don't do it. When Karen did it, something
went wrong. She was never seen again.

01:12:41.725 --> 01:12:44.478
The circle won't be broken this time.

01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:50.159
No, no, no! We ran away once before
and we've regretted it ever since.

01:12:50.364 --> 01:12:53.276
- We must not run out again!
- The blindfold.

01:13:07.802 --> 01:13:12.113
Mr Keller, I have to know exactly
what you said and did that night.

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:17.440
- I told Karen...
- To me, Mr Keller. I'm Karen now.

01:13:17.641 --> 01:13:21.839
- Say it to me!
- Very well.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.396
Once we link hands, you must not show fear,

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:31.151
you must not speak, you must not remove
the blindfold, you must not move at all.

01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:36.516
We shall hold hands and you must not break
our circle of friendship.

01:13:36.718 --> 01:13:41.633
- If anything happens to Jan, I'll break it.
- Don't interfere! Move away!

01:13:42.837 --> 01:13:48.786
We are looking upon you, Karen Aylwood,
willing you to be as one with us.

01:13:48.996 --> 01:13:52.034
We ask the question: is this person worthy?

01:13:53.636 --> 01:13:55.467
Listen.

01:13:55.676 --> 01:14:00.032
Ready to return.
I have been trapped on your planet.

01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:03.352
Karen was my intervention.

01:14:03.595 --> 01:14:07.633
We exchanged places by mistake.

01:14:07.835 --> 01:14:12.066
Magnetic pull of the eclipse
transferred our positions.

01:14:12.993 --> 01:14:15.871
Now exchange places again.

01:14:19.273 --> 01:14:22.662
- Almost time.
- Ellie!

01:14:22.872 --> 01:14:25.466
I must return home.

01:14:25.672 --> 01:14:27.867
Where's home?

01:14:28.872 --> 01:14:31.226
What happened to Karen?

01:14:31.471 --> 01:14:34.463
Continue. Continue.

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:39.585
My power comes from you,
the three linked as before,

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:43.424
when darkness comes at noon.

01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:48.657
- The eclipse.
- It's almost time. Hurry.

01:14:49.589 --> 01:14:54.299
Go on with the ceremony, Mr Keller!
We've gotta beat the eclipse.

01:14:54.868 --> 01:14:56.699
Come on!

01:14:59.588 --> 01:15:05.935
We shall hold hands around you. You
must not break our circle of friendship.

01:15:06.147 --> 01:15:08.819
With joined hands,

01:15:09.027 --> 01:15:13.178
we call upon the powers of the universe

01:15:15.066 --> 01:15:17.625
to grant us...

01:15:32.544 --> 01:15:35.694
This is our chance!
Don't break the circle!

01:15:35.903 --> 01:15:39.054
Mary. Give me your hand!

01:15:43.142 --> 01:15:46.134
Must return home.

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:50.095
Time's running out. Hurry.

01:15:50.301 --> 01:15:53.690
- Hurry.
- But where is Karen?

01:15:55.501 --> 01:15:58.856
Karen was in the way.

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:03.928
Mistake. Transferred by mistake.

01:16:04.139 --> 01:16:07.814
In error we exchanged places.

01:16:08.019 --> 01:16:10.817
Karen's still in my dimension.

01:16:11.018 --> 01:16:13.533
Trapped and suspended.

01:16:13.738 --> 01:16:17.094
Must reverse the process.

01:16:17.298 --> 01:16:19.050
Concentrate.

01:16:19.978 --> 01:16:24.573
Exchange persons again. Transfer back.

01:16:24.777 --> 01:16:28.815
Now. Later too late.

01:16:29.696 --> 01:16:31.050
Now.

01:16:31.256 --> 01:16:33.645
Now. Now.

01:16:37.215 --> 01:16:40.605
- It's taking me!
- Jan, you have to get out of that!

01:16:40.815 --> 01:16:42.692
I can't!

01:16:42.895 --> 01:16:44.771
Jan, move! Move!

01:16:49.654 --> 01:16:52.565
Break the ring! Break it!

01:17:41.768 --> 01:17:43.723
It's Karen.

01:17:45.046 --> 01:17:46.684
We brought her back!

01:18:00.645 --> 01:18:01.964
