00:01.269 --> 00:03.003
My name is Cormoran Strike,
private investigator.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.439
I'm Robin, Robin Ellacott.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.740
I'm the new temp.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.109
How can I help you, John?

00:08.176 --> 00:09.743
It's about my sister,
Lula Landry.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.712
I think she was murdered.

00:11.779 --> 00:14.148
A chap they picked up
on CCTV.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.549
They never traced him.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.451
Even when she's dead,
you lot don't give up.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.188
So you think Lula Landry
was murdered

00:20.254 --> 00:21.522
and we messed up
the investigation?

00:21.589 --> 00:23.091
Not at all,
I just wanna have

00:23.157 --> 00:25.126
a better picture
of Lula's lifestyles.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.728
This is the family,
Lady Yvette Bristow

00:27.795 --> 00:28.862
'with her brother, Tony Landry.'

00:28.929 --> 00:31.132
Family is a complex thing.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.401
You, of all people,
are surely aware of that.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.369
This is Guy Some, the designer

00:35.436 --> 00:37.438
'with Lula's best mate,
Ciara Porter.'

00:37.505 --> 00:39.507
'Evan Duffield, her boyfriend.'

00:39.573 --> 00:42.042
'And this is the film producer.
I'm guessing that's his wife.'

00:42.110 --> 00:43.477
That's Tansy, the neighbor

00:43.544 --> 00:45.279
who changed her statement.

00:45.346 --> 00:49.317
Stay away from the Bestiguis.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.386
Did Lula ever mention
Rochelle Onifade?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.888
- Oh, my little Roch.
'

00:54.955 --> 00:56.590
Rochelle..

00:56.657 --> 00:58.359
Leave me alone!

00:58.426 --> 00:59.927
Who were you talking to?

01:07.335 --> 01:09.470
Come on, Rochelle.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.704
'Rochelle!'

01:14.175 --> 01:15.676
* You and me *

01:17.445 --> 01:20.248
* Me and you *

01:20.314 --> 01:25.453
* Somehow we make it through *

01:26.487 --> 01:29.257
* I may be gone *

01:29.323 --> 01:31.592
* I may be far away *

01:33.161 --> 01:35.563
* But I walk beside you *

01:36.664 --> 01:40.868
* Every step of the way *

01:40.934 --> 01:43.271
* When you're used *

01:43.337 --> 01:45.038
* Bruised *

01:45.105 --> 01:47.441
* Black and blue *

01:47.508 --> 01:52.112
* Don't think about it *

01:52.180 --> 01:55.015
* Never doubt it *

01:55.082 --> 01:58.386
* I'll walk beside you **

02:00.120 --> 02:01.522
It's Cormoran Strike.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.391
You got the cause
of death yet?

02:03.457 --> 02:06.360
Well, pick a card, any card.
Drugs, drowning..

02:06.427 --> 02:10.331
Look, when I dragged her out of
that bath, it was running hot.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.765
'The water tank hadn't emptied.'

02:11.832 --> 02:13.066
That gives you
a clear time frame

02:13.133 --> 02:14.468
for how long she was in there.

02:14.535 --> 02:15.936
I'll send a uniform
to take a statement

02:16.003 --> 02:17.004
from you in due course.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.272
'And check her phone records'

02:18.339 --> 02:19.507
because she called
to warn somebody

02:19.573 --> 02:21.242
when I tried to talk to her.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.843
A drug dealer maybe,
on a rented number.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.078
Listen, I'm quite busy
with real cases. So..

02:25.145 --> 02:26.480
'Goodbye.'

02:36.790 --> 02:40.594
- 'Good morning.'
- Morning.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.637
- Just a little bit sore.

02:50.938 --> 02:54.808
- It's not my first dead body.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.878
I just mean, it was far worse
the first time.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.054
So was it a coincidence,
do you think?

03:07.120 --> 03:09.223
Rochelle dying so close
to Lula.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.592
Well, she had quite
a fragile existence.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.361
But she had money
for new designer gear

03:13.427 --> 03:14.562
and lots of drugs.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.331
- Lula.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.932
Lula's been dead
for three months.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.335
She didn't leave a will.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.504
Plus, why was Rochelle panicked
to see me?

03:23.571 --> 03:25.473
And who was she calling?

03:25.539 --> 03:27.174
She was hiding something.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.176
Surely the police
will investigate.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.578
Maybe.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.483
Time to see how Lula's gang
react to the news.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.436
Good morning, I'm Mike Dundee

03:55.503 --> 03:57.605
from the Health and Safety
Executive.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.607
I need to carry out
a Section 20 interview

03:59.673 --> 04:01.809
under the statuary provisions
accorded to me

04:01.875 --> 04:04.878
by the 1974
Health and Safety Work Act.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.251
A few more.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.558
'Other side.'

04:20.394 --> 04:23.196
- Come on, concentration.
- Lights!

04:25.733 --> 04:28.536
'Ciara, late night,
Was it, darlin'?'

04:37.177 --> 04:39.780
My name is Cormoran Strike.
I'm a private investigator.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.749
I'm busy right now.
Make an appointment with Tricia.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.618
- Rochelle Onifade is dead.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.887
- Lot of drugs, in a hot bath.
- Beginner's error.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.490
Exactly, and she wasn't
a beginner, was she?

04:51.325 --> 04:54.595
Wait. Cormoran Strike?
That's an unusual name.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.029
I presume
I mentioned it before.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.866
- Half-brother.

04:58.932 --> 05:02.302
'He talks about a war-hero
brother called Cormoran.'

05:02.370 --> 05:04.104
I met your dad
a few times, too.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.272
Lucky you.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.574
And why is Jonny Rokeby's son

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642
working as a private detective?

05:08.709 --> 05:10.077
Because that's his job.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.245
I'd like to ask you
a few questions, if that's okay.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.753
I'm Ciara.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.755
I know.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.592
Uh, I see, and, um..

05:24.658 --> 05:26.794
When is Mr. Bestigui back from..

05:28.729 --> 05:30.297
Okay, right.
Well, I'll call then.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.833
Thank you very much.
Thanks.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.535
Hello?

05:34.602 --> 05:37.037
Uh, excuse me.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.806
Excuse me, can I help you?

05:43.076 --> 05:44.111
My brother.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.986
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.489
So, what's my brother
investigating now?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.659
Well, um..

05:59.927 --> 06:02.963
It's someone who...
killed herself.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.465
Only, um..

06:04.532 --> 06:06.266
...one of her relatives
thinks that she didn't.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.668
What does Cormoran think?

06:07.735 --> 06:10.303
Well, I think he's keeping
an open mind. Mm.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.973
Did he tell you
who our mother was?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.708
No.

06:14.775 --> 06:18.378
- Yes.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.947
The verdict was suicide

06:20.013 --> 06:22.783
but Cormoran always thought
her death was suspicious.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.718
- Oh.
- He took her death very badly.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.920
Left Oxford and joined the army.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.389
- I know.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.691
Some clever admissions cheater

06:30.758 --> 06:33.293
saw through the grumpy
Philistine act.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.001
So, how long's he been
sleeping in his office?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.939
So what are you
actually investigating?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.275
Lula Landry's brother
wants me to review

06:48.341 --> 06:49.810
the police inquiry
into her death

06:49.877 --> 06:51.378
and make sure
they carried it out properly.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.481
- No, he's a lawyer.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.783
We always call John
The Accountant.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.486
- It's just a nickname.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.921
How about mummy dearest?
Have you met her yet?

07:00.988 --> 07:02.155
Not recently.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.525
That's why Guy
called her Cuckoo.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.660
Such a fucked up family.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.161
Lula was in the wrong nest.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.963
Guy didn't seem too upset
about Rochelle.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.766
Well, he only cares about
one thing when he's working.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.234
Poor Roch.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.302
Can you tell me a bit about

07:15.368 --> 07:16.604
her relationship with Lula?

07:16.670 --> 07:18.806
Oh, well, she was helping her
with her issues.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.975
Identity, authenticity,
et cetera.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.078
Lula was obsessed
with exploring her real family

07:25.145 --> 07:26.914
by which she meant black.

07:26.980 --> 07:27.848
Her dad's side.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.618
Ciara darling,
we need you now.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.186
On the day she died, Lula spent

07:33.253 --> 07:34.488
a lot of time with Rochelle.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.957
Yeah, they were always
thick as thieves

07:37.024 --> 07:39.593
when Rochelle wasn't having
one of her episodes.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.194
Lula gave her money, too?

07:41.261 --> 07:43.196
Well, she would've
given money to anyone.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.666
But yeah, Rochelle did
well enough out of her.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.936
Hey, love.
Guy is getting fidgety.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.371
I'd quite like to continue
this conversation.

07:51.438 --> 07:52.806
I won't be done here until late

07:52.873 --> 07:54.007
and then I'm going to Uzi.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.677
- But, come..

07:56.744 --> 07:59.647
Um, get the Ginger Line
to Dalston Kingsland

07:59.713 --> 08:02.249
and I'll meet you
at the station. 10:30.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.121
And Matt's going
all red in the face

08:08.188 --> 08:10.824
and blaming me every time
the tank collapses.

08:10.891 --> 08:14.161
- And then it starts raining.
- 'Of course.'

08:14.227 --> 08:16.096
- Um..
- At last.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.799
Robin's told me everything.
So, get your stuff.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.668
'I've got the car
in the John Lewis car park'

08:20.734 --> 08:22.102
and you're coming
to stay with us.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.503
I'm not.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.105
You cannot stay in there
on that camp bed.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.008
It's just short term
while I sort something out.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.109
Tell him, Robin.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.477
It's got nothing
to do with Robin.

08:30.544 --> 08:31.511
Anyway, I'm not stopping.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.946
I'm just picking something up.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.915
- Chelsea.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.350
Well...let me give you a lift.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.487
Let me go and get the car
and I'll run you down there.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.723
I'll see you downstairs in ten.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.028
Bye, Robin.
Really nice to meet you.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.296
Mm. You, too.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.714
'You need to sign this.'

09:25.232 --> 09:26.934
- 'She's great.'

09:27.000 --> 09:29.469
It's ridiculous, a girl
with her figure on a diet.

09:29.536 --> 09:30.904
'Wedding or no wedding.'

09:30.971 --> 09:33.206
It's none of my business,
really.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.644
I loved this when I was a kid.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.781
So, please tell me it's final
with Charlotte this time.

09:40.848 --> 09:41.915
It's final this time.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.583
I'm sorry it's happened,
obviously

09:43.651 --> 09:44.718
but it's much better for you

09:44.785 --> 09:45.986
that she's finally gone.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.187
I left her.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.625
Good.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.495
Well, I better dash
'cause Jack's got football.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.130
Anywhere along here is fine.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.232
Poor little sausage,
can't get in the A-Team.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.701
I said, "You're in
my A-Team, poppet."

10:00.768 --> 10:01.835
But I'm not sure
that was much help--

10:01.902 --> 10:04.271
You're a good mum.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.639
Thanks, Stick.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.945
- I want my kids to always--
- I know.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.690
Anything you need, just ask.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.015
I'll let Mr. Bristow know
you're here.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.824
Ah, come through.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.727
Sorry. I was just sorting
mum's, um..

11:34.394 --> 11:36.029
Uh, heh..

11:37.130 --> 11:39.833
Um, we mustn't be too long.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.936
The, uh, the medicines
make her very confused.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.646
- No.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.648
It's not Uncle Tony, mumsie.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.217
It's Mr. Strike.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.853
We've met before,
long time ago.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.755
I was a friend
of your son, Charlie.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.158
Charlie's dead.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.261
Rode his bicycle
into a quarry.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.364
Yes.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.301
'Now Lula, too.'

12:14.367 --> 12:16.669
It's a terrible thing

12:16.736 --> 12:20.007
when all your children die.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.409
Of course.
Well, no.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.612
People used to say

12:25.678 --> 12:27.614
'"Lula was so beautiful"'

12:27.680 --> 12:29.950
but I never saw her like that.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.552
'Charlie..'

12:32.619 --> 12:34.855
...was the handsome one.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.625
She was the clever one.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.494
Always had an answer
to everything.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.532
It's such a shame.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.735
She spent so much time
fighting with Tony

12:48.802 --> 12:51.671
'over that lovely boy.'

12:51.738 --> 12:56.276
Uh, Evan Duffield
came to visit her..

12:56.343 --> 12:57.710
...after she died.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.014
He said he wished

13:01.081 --> 13:03.817
he had been there
to try and stop her.

13:05.318 --> 13:10.057
No, I think that, too, Johnny.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.960
'Lula...was up there'

13:13.026 --> 13:15.162
in her flat

13:15.228 --> 13:17.064
that night

13:17.130 --> 13:20.067
in such a terrible state

13:20.133 --> 13:24.037
'all alone, while we were here'

13:24.104 --> 13:27.240
watching silly old movies.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.710
Um, mum's a big fan
of Cary Grant.

13:30.777 --> 13:33.813
We watched "Bringing Up Baby"
the night that Lula died.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.949
Time for your medicine.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.854
Thank you, Marsha.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.501
That's the morphine, so..

14:00.173 --> 14:01.808
She said

14:01.875 --> 14:04.477
she was frightened of him.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.548
Who?

14:08.615 --> 14:10.217
Frightened of who?

14:16.356 --> 14:17.857
What did she say
to you, mother?

14:17.925 --> 14:20.127
Frightened of Evan?

14:22.729 --> 14:25.032
Bring some macaroons

14:25.098 --> 14:28.101
'the next time you come,
Mr. Burn.'

14:28.168 --> 14:30.103
'The leopard never'

14:30.170 --> 14:33.106
'changes his spots.'

14:43.250 --> 14:44.817
I wanna know
why Tansy Bestigui

14:44.884 --> 14:46.519
was lying about that night.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.188
And the chap on the CCTV?

14:48.255 --> 14:49.756
That's gonna take
a bit of time.

14:49.822 --> 14:50.890
Mm, that's where

14:50.958 --> 14:52.559
the answer lies,
I'm sure of it.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.295
How much do you know about your
uncle's movements that day?

14:55.362 --> 14:58.031
Uh, he was in
the office all day.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.467
Uh, then, he went to Oxford
for a conference

15:00.533 --> 15:02.569
uh, popped in here
on the way out

15:02.635 --> 15:04.871
to see mum. Why?

15:04.938 --> 15:06.339
I just need to be
absolutely sure

15:06.406 --> 15:08.808
we know exactly who Lula saw
on the day she died.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.477
Tony didn't see her.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.412
He didn't visit
Kentigern Gardens that day.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.981
I'm sure of that.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.485
- Okay.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.877
- Oh, I got her hair.
- No.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.713
- 'Oh, shit.'
- 'Ha-ha.'

15:49.016 --> 15:50.850
Oh, my Little Rock.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.952
- This is my Little Rock.
- Mwah.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.954
My Little Rock knows
more about me

15:55.022 --> 15:57.590
than you lot ever will.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.844
'God, did you hear
about poor Rochelle?'

17:24.911 --> 17:27.180
Of course I did,
every time somebody dies..

17:27.247 --> 17:30.049
...cops are on me case.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.319
- Evan, this is Cormoran Strike.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.287
'He's Jonny Rokeby's son.'

17:34.354 --> 17:36.189
I know your old man
a bit as it goes.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.326
- Yeah, full of it.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.960
Don't think
he'll ever lose it.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.168
'Hey, cocaine? Oh..'

17:49.969 --> 17:52.972
So, Cormoran is
a private investigator.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.774
I thought you said
he was Rokeby's son.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.709
The two aren't incompatible.

17:56.776 --> 17:57.910
What're you investigatin'?

17:57.977 --> 17:59.646
I've been hired by
Lula Landry's family

17:59.712 --> 18:02.149
to review the circumstances
of her death.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.885
Being a size zero, it was easy
enough for me to get her out--

18:05.952 --> 18:07.687
Oh, stop it, Evan,
honestly, I don't like it--

18:07.754 --> 18:10.257
It's what they say
on the internet, isn't it?

18:11.924 --> 18:13.493
Must've been Evan.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.930
This is breaking
my buzz completely.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.332
I don't wanna break
your buzz, Evan.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.601
But you are though,
ambushing me

18:21.668 --> 18:23.069
asking me questions
about Lula.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.404
I haven't asked you anything.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.873
He didn't even know
you were gonna be here.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.441
Get him away from me.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.577
Get the fuck away from me!

18:30.643 --> 18:33.112
Listen, I want him out.
Get him out!

18:33.180 --> 18:34.214
He's harassing me!

19:05.345 --> 19:08.181
Ciara called me.
She's coming out in a sec.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.056
- 'Ciara..'
- Ciara!

19:24.831 --> 19:27.867
I'm so sorry about that.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.937
Evan's always get a bit fretty
when he's off the gear.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.906
Where do you wanna go now?

19:33.973 --> 19:36.108
Do you mind terribly if we have
a night cap at mine?

19:36.175 --> 19:37.877
I have an early start tomorrow.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.317
* God knows that I love you *

19:46.519 --> 19:49.021
* Too bad you don't have to *

19:49.088 --> 19:50.557
* Don't work *

19:51.691 --> 19:54.361
* You're the girl that I need *

19:56.796 --> 19:58.164
* Don't know
but it feels right *

19:59.266 --> 20:01.668
You've actually read Proust?

20:01.734 --> 20:03.803
In French, too.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.172
He's often quite funny.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.840
I have a deferred
place at Cambridge

20:07.907 --> 20:10.243
to read modern languages,
I'll have you know.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.248
Your mum's in there

20:15.315 --> 20:16.983
'wearing the most fabulous'

20:17.049 --> 20:19.218
Ossie Clark buttermilk dress.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.424
This is not at all
the place I imagined

20:24.491 --> 20:26.293
a supermodel would live

20:26.359 --> 20:27.627
than Kentigern Gardens.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.663
'Yeah, it was a bit
of a luxury prison.'

20:33.266 --> 20:34.967
But Lula could really
hide herself away

20:35.034 --> 20:36.503
from everybody there.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.038
Sometimes, she'd open the window
and she'd call me.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.874
We'd pretend to bark
across the city

20:41.941 --> 20:45.512
to each other
like in a "101 Dalmatians."

20:45.578 --> 20:47.747
- It was funny at the time.
- Huh.

20:47.814 --> 20:51.250
Evan came here
the night she died.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.752
Tabloids obviously
tried to make out

20:52.819 --> 20:54.587
he came here
for a revenge shag.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.655
Did he?

20:55.722 --> 20:57.056
We listened to some demos
for his album

20:57.123 --> 20:58.858
smoked some weed,
and went to sleep.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.395
- Lula was my friend.
- Yeah, sorry.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.375
Guy's marvelous
detachable linings.

21:16.543 --> 21:20.347
Very handy for models
in clubs.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.322
No, thanks.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.465
Besides..

21:38.531 --> 21:40.833
...Evan's not really my type.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.202
- Uh-uh.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.505
I don't usually go
for pretty boys.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.173
Oh, that's a shame.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.741
I thought there might be
a little chance.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.614
The other leg's the one
with nerve endings by the way.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.317
I know about your leg.

21:58.385 --> 22:01.554
Quite amputee-curious, actually.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.656
You'll be disappointed.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.392
Literally nothing to see.

22:12.064 --> 22:15.468
You know, you said you know
my dad and my brother.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.336
I haven't.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.572
* God knows that I love you *

22:19.639 --> 22:21.641
* You baby **

23:15.495 --> 23:16.929
Morning.

23:24.437 --> 23:25.772
Hm.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.635
What?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.744
Went and sat at William Blake's
grave last night.

24:38.545 --> 24:39.912
Okay.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.616
Any particular reason?

24:44.817 --> 24:47.520
I like to check in on him
from time to time.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.090
You see, Blake
was into free love.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.992
Don't restrict your desires.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.262
Naughty.

24:59.766 --> 25:02.535
Has anybody told you
you're absolutely gorgeous?

25:06.539 --> 25:08.841
- Oh.
- There he is.

25:08.908 --> 25:11.443
Enjoy yourself
with Ciara, did ya?

25:11.510 --> 25:12.812
Girl's pure filth.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.683
'Come on through to my office.'

25:23.489 --> 25:25.357
Does the family
think it was me?

25:25.424 --> 25:26.959
- No, I don't think so.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.494
Well, you got a nasty temper.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.429
- But your alibi's strong.
'

25:30.496 --> 25:32.599
'Well, I was lucky someone
saw me without the wharf hat on'

25:32.665 --> 25:35.902
because the old Bill would love
to get me sent down.

25:35.968 --> 25:38.237
Probably right about that.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.539
'I miss Lules, you know?'

25:40.607 --> 25:42.675
We had some fights, but..

25:42.742 --> 25:44.911
...we would share
a laugh together.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.279
You came here to tell me
more than that.

25:47.346 --> 25:49.682
- Freddie Bestigui.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.084
He was always pestering Lula
to be in his films.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.452
Could she act?

25:53.519 --> 25:55.221
Let's just say talent

25:55.287 --> 25:56.455
isn't a number-one requirement.

25:56.522 --> 25:59.558
But Lula, she's box office.

26:01.427 --> 26:02.729
She turned him down?

26:02.795 --> 26:04.997
Well, she hated him.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.366
Then, he wanted to do
a biopic with me in it.

26:07.433 --> 26:08.935
But I mean,
it never came to nothing

26:09.001 --> 26:12.338
because the Bristow family
went full cease-and-desist.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.841
We had lunch, and I got friendly
with one of his assistants.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.575
I'm guessing that's a girl.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.179
See, this Georgia,
she tells me

26:20.246 --> 26:22.448
he's like a massive
control freak.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.483
Obsessed with his wife's
coke habit..

26:24.550 --> 26:26.552
...like, it's personal.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.320
In restaurants,
if Tansy doesn't order

26:28.387 --> 26:29.722
three courses plus cheese

26:29.789 --> 26:31.658
he takes her pulse
to check she ain't usin'.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.763
Anyway, this one time,
Georgia says

26:36.829 --> 26:38.530
"The worm's turned."

26:38.597 --> 26:40.867
Even Tansy's had enough,
and she goes to him

26:40.933 --> 26:43.736
"Stop it, Freddie,
let go of my wrist

26:43.803 --> 26:45.071
"unless you want me
to tell the police

26:45.137 --> 26:47.539
where I really was
the night Lula died."

26:53.545 --> 26:54.981
Bye, Robin.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.049
- 'Sorry I gave you a fright.'
- 'That's alright.'

26:57.116 --> 26:58.718
'Doing a secret gig next month.'

26:58.785 --> 27:00.619
You're on the guest list
with a minus one.

27:00.687 --> 27:01.921
Well, thank you very much.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.790
Those Guy Some gloves?

27:05.391 --> 27:08.795
God, yeah, must've picked
them up somewhere.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.574
Could you look up the train
times all over Heath, please?

27:22.641 --> 27:24.844
Mm, are you planning on going

27:24.911 --> 27:26.813
to Freddie's office
at Pinewood?

27:26.879 --> 27:29.415
Yeah, I'm gonna try
and flag my way in somehow.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.917
Well, there's not much point.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.885
'Finally got a hold of his PA'

27:32.952 --> 27:35.187
'he left for the Miami
Film Festival this morning'

27:35.254 --> 27:37.389
and from there, he's going
to LA for a few days.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.358
Well, I'm still goin' out.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.327
'I'm hoping to catch
Tansy Bestigui'

27:41.393 --> 27:43.662
'so I'll be gone
the rest of the day.'

27:43.730 --> 27:46.298
Well, I won't be around
early afternoon, anyway.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.268
Why not?

27:50.737 --> 27:52.171
Job interview.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.308
'I did write it in the diary.'

27:56.375 --> 27:57.443
Fine.

28:09.756 --> 28:12.158
Oh, yes, I'm definitely
a people person.

28:30.609 --> 28:33.379
- Oh! It was amazing.
- Yeah.

28:33.445 --> 28:34.747
Finally.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.956
I've been talkin' about..
God knows how long.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.426
It was fantastic,
we'll do it again.

29:20.492 --> 29:21.460
Have a good one.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.328
So, you didn't finish
your university degree?

31:02.394 --> 31:03.963
No.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.797
And you were studying
psychology?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.566
That's right.

31:07.633 --> 31:08.767
Why did you leave?

31:09.868 --> 31:10.903
Sorry?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.038
Why did you leave university

31:12.104 --> 31:14.240
before your final exams?

31:14.306 --> 31:18.444
I had..
It was a personal reason.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.180
Oh, that's fine, that's fine.
You don't have to..

31:21.247 --> 31:24.116
- No, not academic. No.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.884
No, I...loved my course.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.819
I was hoping for first.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.123
Well, psychology plays
a big part in human resources.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.760
'So, Robin, just to kick us off'

31:34.826 --> 31:38.464
could you tell us three people
you'd consider inspirational?

32:20.872 --> 32:23.442
I can't believe you're even
thinking about not takin' it.

32:23.509 --> 32:27.313
It, uh, it was just
so bland and corporate.

32:27.379 --> 32:29.081
Like where I work, you mean?

32:29.148 --> 32:31.050
No, I didn't mean that.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.485
Y-you love your job.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.887
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be an astronaut.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.257
But you know..

32:38.324 --> 32:39.625
Robin.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.261
Obviously, I can't make you
take a job you don't want.

32:42.328 --> 32:43.662
Well, that's good to know.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.067
I'm not eating courgette,
by the way.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.736
Fine.
You can have pasta.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.505
Fine.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.916
What? Y-yes, thank you, that's
very kind of you to say so.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.419
'Yes, I will certainly do that.'

33:07.486 --> 33:09.221
Thank you. Bye.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.827
So, how did
the job interview go?

33:15.894 --> 33:19.498
Well, that was them, just
calling to say I got the job.

33:19.565 --> 33:20.566
That was quick.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.268
You must've really
impressed them.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.235
Mm.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.537
I said I was passionate
about people.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.207
Yeah, well, we all need to

33:28.274 --> 33:31.777
jump through the hoops
from time to time.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.046
They'll be lucky to have you.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.283
I don't gossip.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.817
When your sister
came into the office

33:38.884 --> 33:40.486
she said that
I told her everything.

33:40.552 --> 33:41.787
Half-sister.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.356
Don't worry.
I know what Lucy can be like.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.193
I understand
about confidentiality.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.694
Especially in this job.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.730
I-I told Matt a tiny bit
about Lula Landry, but..

33:51.797 --> 33:53.099
Robin, don't worry about it.

33:53.165 --> 33:55.367
You're discreet.
I can see that.

33:58.003 --> 34:01.173
- Next week.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.712
Do you wanna see
something interesting?

34:06.778 --> 34:08.114
Mm.

34:15.754 --> 34:16.922
Bloody hell, is that--

34:16.988 --> 34:18.657
John Bristow's uncle
with his hand

34:18.724 --> 34:19.958
on Tansy Bestigui's ass.

34:20.025 --> 34:23.162
I hate it when men
do that in public.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.131
S

34:25.197 --> 34:26.798
I don't fully know yet.

34:26.865 --> 34:28.267
What're you gonna do with it?

34:28.334 --> 34:30.802
Use it for a bit
of shock and awe.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.702
- Go away, or I'll call--
- Tony Landry again.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.271
He came to meet me
in a restaurant.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.839
I've got nothing to say to you.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.641
Well, perhaps a hotel.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.047
Move your foot.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.651
I can tell you straight away
that my husband

35:19.718 --> 35:22.821
will both see and query
any money I give you. So--

35:22.888 --> 35:24.656
I don't want money.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.058
- Information.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.295
No, only paying clients
get to see evidence

35:29.361 --> 35:30.896
of their cheating partners.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.030
How very moral of you.

35:32.097 --> 35:33.765
Well, not everybody
in my profession

35:33.832 --> 35:35.434
will be so scrupulous, Tansy.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.002
Especially seeing
as you are perverting

35:37.068 --> 35:39.271
the course of justice.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.507
You have no idea.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.576
About what?

35:44.643 --> 35:45.744
Anything.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.986
Where were you
on the night Lula died?

35:55.053 --> 35:56.555
I was here.

35:56.622 --> 35:59.858
I was here with my husband.
I told the truth.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.561
Well, I believe
you were here.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.929
I believe
you were with your husband

36:03.995 --> 36:05.497
but I'd like to know
why you were shivering

36:05.564 --> 36:08.166
with the cold when you ran
into the lobby?

36:08.234 --> 36:11.237
I had just seen Lula fall.

36:11.303 --> 36:14.840
Derrick came running,
it was shock.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.643
When Freddie found something
in your handbag

36:17.709 --> 36:20.446
and he caught you doing the
sneaky line in the bathroom

36:20.512 --> 36:23.649
or did he check your pulse as
you were gettin' ready for bed?

36:23.715 --> 36:27.319
He locked you out on that
balcony in your underwear

36:27.386 --> 36:29.288
on a freezing night.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.024
That's where you were
when Lula fell.

36:33.091 --> 36:34.593
- No.
- Yes.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.495
Because you heard something
and that's the only place

36:36.562 --> 36:39.365
you could've heard something.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.833
He likes punishments,
doesn't he?

36:41.900 --> 36:44.636
Confining somebody to
a small uncomfortable space.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.873
That's the first weapon
in a torturer's handbook.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.242
My husband isn't a torturer.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.460
Do you have children?

37:14.566 --> 37:15.701
No.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.270
Ever wanted any children?

37:18.337 --> 37:19.838
Not really.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.741
I have.

37:22.808 --> 37:26.945
A little, uh...girl
I could sing to each night

37:27.012 --> 37:29.881
and...brush her hair.

37:31.149 --> 37:33.652
A-and later..

37:34.953 --> 37:36.855
...when I got old..

37:38.290 --> 37:39.658
...we could have tea together

37:39.725 --> 37:42.694
and talk about our lives.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.973
He didn't want me..

37:55.040 --> 37:56.608
...to have a job.

37:56.675 --> 37:59.277
He didn't want us
to have kids.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.613
So..

38:03.048 --> 38:05.684
...this is what I have.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.590
Tony?

38:14.025 --> 38:17.929
Mm...no.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.801
Family image
is everything to him.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.472
He'd never leave them.

38:32.778 --> 38:35.547
Just tell me what you heard
out there, Tansy.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.451
Tell me because
by protecting a sadist

38:39.518 --> 38:41.987
you might be letting
a murderer go free.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.694
'Talk to me, Tansy.'

38:51.597 --> 38:52.998
'Two voices shouting.'

38:53.064 --> 38:55.300
The only thing she remembers
hearing clearly is

38:55.367 --> 38:58.169
"It's too late.
I've already done it."

38:58.236 --> 38:59.571
'Lula?'

39:00.939 --> 39:03.074
- 'Don't know yet.'

39:04.476 --> 39:06.277
And she didn't recognize
the other voice?

39:06.344 --> 39:07.646
No.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.783
Well, it can't
have been Freddie.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.952
You wouldn't...lock your wife
on the balcony

39:14.019 --> 39:15.621
and then run upstairs
and push another woman

39:15.687 --> 39:17.222
from the one straight overhead.

39:17.288 --> 39:20.325
- Agreed.
- So, Evan was--

39:20.392 --> 39:23.028
Was pointing the finger
for whatever reason.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.397
Hm.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.633
God, her life sounds awful.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.201
Yeah, she should leave him.

39:30.268 --> 39:31.603
Do you think she will?

39:33.238 --> 39:34.573
No.

39:58.430 --> 39:59.798
'It's me.'

40:01.933 --> 40:03.068
Charlotte.

40:05.303 --> 40:06.672
What do you want?

40:06.738 --> 40:09.875
'Come back now,
or you'll lose me for good.'

40:27.693 --> 40:29.995
- Early.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.501
I've got a man cave, too,
you know?

40:35.567 --> 40:37.503
But it's attached to a house.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.606
Let's get some breakfast.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.446
Annoyingly...some
of your questions

40:48.514 --> 40:50.448
about Rochelle Onifade
got stuck in my head.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.551
Well, I thought so.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.786
That point about
the size of the water tank..

40:56.221 --> 40:57.322
You were right.

40:57.388 --> 40:58.389
That was a good call,
that was smart.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.891
The water still runnin' hot?

40:59.958 --> 41:02.260
Well, it doesn't stack up
all of the breakdown

41:02.327 --> 41:04.295
of the drugs in her body.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.264
- She was murdered.

41:06.331 --> 41:09.668
Well, that...doesn't mean
anything to Lula Landry.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.673
Could be just some dealer
Rochelle pissed off.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.808
Could be, only, it's a lot
of trouble to go to

41:16.875 --> 41:19.010
when a knife
would've done the job.

41:19.077 --> 41:20.812
Oh.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.584
Anstis said
you were a good cop.

41:25.651 --> 41:28.554
Yeah? Told me
you saved his life.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.088
And support the Arsenal.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.923
Not sure which is the bigger
error of judgment.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.726
He exaggerates
about the former.

41:37.563 --> 41:40.331
I don't wanna make
anybody look..

41:40.398 --> 41:42.601
...you know, but..

41:42.668 --> 41:44.970
...you made a mistake
with Tansy Bestigui

41:45.036 --> 41:46.905
'cause she was on the balcony

41:46.972 --> 41:49.775
and she did hear
somebody else upstairs.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.409
You know, I'd like to see
the full CCTV

41:51.476 --> 41:52.911
from around Kentigern Gardens.

41:52.978 --> 41:56.848
Would you now?
And what do I get?

41:56.915 --> 41:59.517
Credit, shared information.

41:59.585 --> 42:01.853
I can do stuff you can't.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.255
It's not too late to be
on the right side of this one.

42:47.933 --> 42:48.934
Morning.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.469
I'm going
to Kentigern Gardens now.

42:51.536 --> 42:52.638
Okay.

42:52.704 --> 42:54.505
'And tomorrow,
we're going to Vashti.'

42:54.572 --> 42:56.307
Lula's favorite clothes shop.

42:57.809 --> 42:59.277
'You'll be trying on
some frocks.'

42:59.344 --> 43:01.379
'I'll be your brother trying
to find a suitable gift'

43:01.446 --> 43:03.514
'for my wedding anniversary.'

43:03.581 --> 43:04.916
How come?

43:04.983 --> 43:06.251
Somebody in there's talking

43:06.317 --> 43:08.053
to the press about Lula.

43:08.119 --> 43:11.156
I wanna find out who it is, what
they know, how they know it.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.368
Cormoran Strike's office.

43:24.703 --> 43:27.605
N-no, sorry,
she's not here anymore.

43:27.673 --> 43:30.041
No, I don't, sorry.

43:30.108 --> 43:33.611
My name? I'm Ashlee Jones,
his new assistant.

43:33.679 --> 43:36.181
And that's L-E-E, not I-G-H.

43:36.247 --> 43:37.883
You're very welcome.

43:40.786 --> 43:42.587
Some pre-solutions
are on my case.

43:42.654 --> 43:44.756
Not sure they quite believed me.

43:44.823 --> 43:46.624
I suppose it doesn't matter
if they backlist you

43:46.692 --> 43:48.393
now you've got a permanent job.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.261
I'm gonna pick up some lunch
on the way back.

43:50.328 --> 43:52.130
Do you want anything?

43:52.197 --> 43:54.299
Miso soup day.

43:54.365 --> 43:55.867
Bad luck.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.990
Want me to let you up
into Lula's flat?

44:19.057 --> 44:21.159
I would like to see
the pool again.

44:27.733 --> 44:32.570
That night you gave Tansy
a towel because she was cold.

44:32.637 --> 44:33.739
It was handy in a way,
there was one

44:33.805 --> 44:35.741
just lying about on your desk.

44:41.346 --> 44:45.216
I travel in every day
from East Croydon.

44:45.283 --> 44:48.453
Sometimes, I can't sleep
because of the hours, and..

44:48.519 --> 44:50.956
...all the stuff in my head.
It's..

44:52.423 --> 44:55.393
But swimming..

44:56.494 --> 44:58.730
...really helps, you know?

44:58.797 --> 45:00.131
Of course.

45:01.399 --> 45:04.069
You left your desk,
didn't you?

45:05.670 --> 45:08.106
Look, I can't afford
to lose this job.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.342
I owe money
on my credit cards and..

45:11.409 --> 45:14.746
...my kids have lots
and lots of birthdays.

45:16.181 --> 45:17.448
Look..

45:18.649 --> 45:20.118
How long were you in here?

45:20.185 --> 45:22.487
Twenty minutes?
Half an hour?

45:23.321 --> 45:25.256
About that.

45:25.323 --> 45:26.491
Fifty laps.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.159
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.862
- I promise.
- Thanks.

45:30.929 --> 45:33.832
Is anybody in the Deeby Macc
flat right now?

45:36.835 --> 45:38.069
Come on in.

45:47.012 --> 45:48.713
Cormoran Strike's office.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.281
'May I speak
to Cormoran Strike?'

45:50.348 --> 45:51.950
Uh, I'm sorry, he's not in
at the moment.

45:52.017 --> 45:53.584
Can I take a message?

45:53.651 --> 45:56.988
'Yeah, you may say that
Charlotte Campbell called.'

46:00.025 --> 46:01.692
I will pass that on.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.694
'Please make sure you do.'

46:03.761 --> 46:06.031
'It's very important.'

46:47.973 --> 46:51.342
And this flat's been empty
for three months?

46:51.409 --> 46:54.412
'These luxury rentals
often stay empty.'

46:54.479 --> 46:55.881
'I think some couple
from Singapore'

46:55.947 --> 46:58.283
'are about to take the lease.'

47:03.989 --> 47:06.291
Any deliveries here that day?

47:06.357 --> 47:07.458
Yeah, uh..

47:07.525 --> 47:10.495
Freddie Bestigui
sent Deeby some flowers.

47:11.930 --> 47:14.065
Lula get any flowers as well?

47:15.366 --> 47:18.236
Not that I know of.

47:18.303 --> 47:22.473
You definitely didn't deliver
roses up to her flat that day?

47:22.540 --> 47:23.875
No.

47:25.776 --> 47:27.378
Well, any other deliveries here?

47:27.445 --> 47:30.148
Yeah, all sorts,
champagne, uh, pudding

47:30.215 --> 47:32.217
leather gloves..
Some fashion designer.

47:32.283 --> 47:34.452
- I don't know.

47:35.486 --> 47:37.355
Actually, yeah, I do.

47:37.422 --> 47:40.425
Uh, 'cause I call him Guy Some,
and they all laughed

47:40.491 --> 47:42.460
and said it wasn't
pronounced that way.

47:42.527 --> 47:43.929
Guy Some.

47:44.695 --> 47:46.031
- Yeah.
- Okay.

47:46.097 --> 47:47.665
Oh, uh, somebody else. Uh..

47:47.732 --> 47:51.069
'The Night Wolf Security came
here to fix the alarm pad.'

47:51.136 --> 47:53.504
And Lechsinka, the cleaner.

47:53.571 --> 47:54.605
She was in for a bit.

47:54.672 --> 47:56.741
Quite a bit of coming
and going, then?

47:56.807 --> 47:58.176
Yeah, up until the early evening

47:58.243 --> 48:00.979
then they all just died off.

48:01.046 --> 48:04.182
Good.
Well, that's all for now.

48:04.249 --> 48:08.053
No offense, but I hope
now means ever.

48:17.062 --> 48:18.496
Oh, this came for you.

49:02.073 --> 49:05.043
I think Lula Landry
was murdered, Robin.

49:05.110 --> 49:07.545
There, white roses
just like the ones

49:07.612 --> 49:09.314
Freddie sent to Deeby Macc
that day.

49:09.380 --> 49:11.216
But this photo was taken
in Lula's flat.

49:11.282 --> 49:12.883
Now, how did they get there?

49:12.950 --> 49:15.586
My guess is the killer took them
from the flat downstairs.

49:15.653 --> 49:17.188
- I don't know.

49:17.255 --> 49:19.124
But he could've easily
snuck in that day amid

49:19.190 --> 49:22.493
all the hustle and bustle.
Deliveries, cleaners..

49:22.560 --> 49:24.362
The one big mistake they made
was to leave the flowers

49:24.429 --> 49:26.664
in Lula's flat when they fled
in such a hurry.

49:26.731 --> 49:28.899
Then they got lucky,
Derrick wasn't on his desk

49:28.966 --> 49:29.967
for the reasons I thought.

49:30.035 --> 49:31.269
- Yup.

49:31.336 --> 49:32.703
So, the killer scarpers.

49:32.770 --> 49:33.938
Freddie lets Tansy back in

49:34.005 --> 49:35.606
to stop her screaming.

49:35.673 --> 49:38.076
The killer gets out just before
Tansy hits the lobby

49:38.143 --> 49:40.178
and Derrick arrives
back from the pool.

49:41.246 --> 49:43.014
So, who do you think it is?

49:43.081 --> 49:45.316
That's still a work
in progress.

49:45.383 --> 49:47.352
But it's the same person
who killed Rochelle.

49:47.418 --> 49:49.154
I just need to find out why.

49:50.621 --> 49:53.058
Crispy-duck-with-extra-pancakes
day for me.

49:53.124 --> 49:55.126
'Are you quite sure?'

49:57.195 --> 49:59.530
What's up?

49:59.597 --> 50:02.467
- Charlotte Campbell rang.

50:03.934 --> 50:07.272
She just said, "Tell him
Charlotte Campbell called."

50:07.338 --> 50:10.308
Soon to be Mrs. Jago Ross.

50:12.210 --> 50:14.412
Okay. Thanks.

50:36.801 --> 50:39.104
'Probably won't be back
until the end of the day.'

51:38.729 --> 51:40.465
Hi.

51:40.531 --> 51:43.401
Ah! Robin.

51:43.468 --> 51:45.736
It's late.
What're you doing here?

51:45.803 --> 51:48.339
I was looking for you.

51:48.406 --> 51:50.408
You're a very nice person.

51:50.475 --> 51:52.410
Don't go anywhere.
I'll just get myself a drink.

51:52.477 --> 51:54.512
I won't go anywhere,
cross my heart.

51:54.579 --> 51:56.981
Actually, Robin,
I'm a wee bit pissed.

51:57.047 --> 51:58.749
I'll have a white wine, please.

51:58.816 --> 51:59.850
Small or large?

51:59.917 --> 52:02.753
- Extra large.
- Small, please.

52:02.820 --> 52:04.222
Lightweight.

52:04.289 --> 52:06.624
Put it on the super tab.

52:08.659 --> 52:09.760
Thanks.

52:09.827 --> 52:12.363
Do you know what I like
about you, Robin?

52:13.398 --> 52:16.401
You're a very decent person.

52:16.467 --> 52:19.437
And you have good skills,
skillset.

52:20.671 --> 52:22.106
Thanks.

52:22.173 --> 52:23.608
I think..

52:25.310 --> 52:27.745
You got to know
when to ask a question..

52:29.214 --> 52:31.081
...and when to not
ask a question.

52:31.148 --> 52:32.983
Give people time.

52:33.050 --> 52:35.052
Yeah.

52:35.119 --> 52:37.688
- No, I'm not hungry.

52:37.755 --> 52:40.891
Oh, come on.
It can't be that bad.

52:44.995 --> 52:47.998
- You can't smoke in here.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.669
They've ruined pubs.

52:51.736 --> 52:53.538
Pubs used to be
bloody brilliant.

52:53.604 --> 52:57.308
I remember
when this were all pubs.

52:57.375 --> 53:00.044
Nothing but pubs,
even the buses, Robin

53:00.110 --> 53:01.446
they were mobile pubs.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.748
- Happy days.
- They were happy.

53:03.814 --> 53:06.050
You know what's ruined
everything, it's..

53:06.116 --> 53:07.885
...digitalization.

53:07.952 --> 53:11.589
Letters...gone.
What happened to love letters?

53:11.656 --> 53:13.624
- Digitalization.
- That's what I said.

53:13.691 --> 53:15.560
You're not gonna write
a love mail, are you?

53:15.626 --> 53:18.329
- Well, I'd--
- No, you can't, exactly.

53:18.396 --> 53:21.098
Internet groceries..

53:21.165 --> 53:23.167
It.. What?

53:23.234 --> 53:24.669
What's that all about?

53:24.735 --> 53:27.872
Then go to the supermarket,
you lazy fuckers.

53:27.938 --> 53:30.708
And now, you can't even have
a fag in a pub

53:30.775 --> 53:34.479
and there aren't any counsel
houses or love letters anymore.

53:34.545 --> 53:37.515
And what're you laughing at?

53:37.582 --> 53:39.550
Do you think it's funny
that people can't afford

53:39.617 --> 53:41.586
to live near their
place of work anymore?

53:41.652 --> 53:43.654
- Cormoran, let's--
- Beardy.

53:45.089 --> 53:46.891
Sorry.

53:46.957 --> 53:49.327
You'll be alright.
Let's go.

53:51.996 --> 53:53.998
I'm a bit sad, Robin.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.333
I know.

54:52.523 --> 54:54.325
'I don't need those.'

54:54.392 --> 54:55.826
Well, just in case.

54:57.562 --> 54:59.764
Are you gonna be okay
for Vashti in the morning?

54:59.830 --> 55:02.166
Of course I am.

55:02.232 --> 55:04.869
I'm a very lucky person, Robin.

55:04.935 --> 55:08.473
First, I have
the kind of metabolism

55:08.539 --> 55:11.676
where I can eat what I want
and stay pencil-thin.

55:11.742 --> 55:15.413
And second, I don't,
I-I don't really get hangovers.

55:15.480 --> 55:17.415
Well, that is lucky.

55:20.718 --> 55:23.854
Blasted leg's
bloody killing me.

55:31.195 --> 55:33.764
Cruelty or mercy.

55:34.999 --> 55:35.966
Hm?

55:37.502 --> 55:38.903
A kid with a gun.

55:38.969 --> 55:41.739
He could've shot me
after the explosion.

55:44.141 --> 55:46.343
But he looked at my leg..

55:47.512 --> 55:49.947
...and just winked.

55:55.653 --> 55:57.488
Maybe a bit of both.

56:00.057 --> 56:01.692
Maybe so.

56:06.163 --> 56:07.698
You go home.

56:14.439 --> 56:16.941
- I'm alright now.
- Right.

56:33.357 --> 56:35.460
I'm switching the light up.

56:37.194 --> 56:38.162
Yeah.

58:00.210 --> 58:01.646
Fuck.

58:04.081 --> 58:05.783
Fuckin' hell.

58:51.461 --> 58:53.097
It was you.

58:54.098 --> 58:56.033
'You killed Lula.'

59:31.869 --> 59:33.838
Lula Landry came in here
a lot, didn't she?

59:33.904 --> 59:36.641
The day she died,
this changing room.

59:36.707 --> 59:39.209
You're not the first young lady
who's come asking about him.

59:39.276 --> 59:40.945
What's this really about?

59:41.011 --> 59:44.915
I think it was very sudden
and brutal.

59:44.982 --> 59:47.718
Tony didn't want us
to have her.

59:47.785 --> 59:51.756
I always had Lula's best
interest at heart. Always.

59:51.822 --> 59:54.224
Get out of my studio.

59:54.291 --> 59:57.527
You think she was killed
because she made a will?

59:57.594 --> 59:59.263
He'll kill again if he has to.
