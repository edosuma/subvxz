GOOFY VOICE
<i>Welcome to the store.</i>

01:28.692 --> 01:30.494
<i>Are you a Busy Beaver?</i>

01:30.529 --> 01:33.794
No, I am not a Busy Beaver.

01:39.901 --> 01:41.868
<i>Are you a Frequent Beaver?</i>

01:41.903 --> 01:43.804
<i>Join our rewards club</i>
<i>for savings.</i>

01:43.839 --> 01:47.181
<i>You can get your teeth</i>
<i>into our dam good deals.</i>

01:53.387 --> 01:54.485
<i>Don't forget:</i>

01:54.520 --> 01:57.224
<i>If you need help, ask a Beaver.</i>

01:58.524 --> 02:00.722
Oh, oh!

02:00.757 --> 02:03.197
Hey. Oh, can I, uh, help you
with that, sir?

02:03.232 --> 02:06.200
Do you think
I don't know how to cut rope?

02:06.235 --> 02:08.697
No, it's just we usually do that
for ya.

02:08.732 --> 02:10.534
Do you think
I'm gonna cut myself

02:10.569 --> 02:12.833
and bleed all over your floor
and sue you?

02:15.167 --> 02:16.210
No.

02:16.245 --> 02:17.739
Then I don't need your help.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.709
Have an excellent day.

02:22.416 --> 02:24.680
<i>I'm a Busy Beaver.</i>

02:24.715 --> 02:26.176
Idiot.

02:27.388 --> 02:30.257
Did you, um, find everything

02:30.292 --> 02:32.490
you were lookin' for today?
Yes.

02:32.525 --> 02:33.458
Good.

02:34.956 --> 02:36.593
Let's see here.

02:40.126 --> 02:43.369
Uh, your total is 3.47.

02:43.404 --> 02:45.866
You charged me
for 6 feet of rope.

02:45.901 --> 02:48.539
Oh, yes, it's 99 cents a yard.

02:48.574 --> 02:52.202
I didn't get 2 yards.
I got 5 feet.

02:52.237 --> 02:54.578
Uh, yeah, we don't charge
by the foot.

02:54.613 --> 02:56.613
We charge by the yard.
99 cents a yard

02:56.648 --> 02:59.451
is 33 cents a foot,
times 5, that's 1.65.

02:59.486 --> 03:02.256
You charged me $1.98.

03:02.291 --> 03:03.917
You're good at math. Um...

03:03.952 --> 03:06.458
No, I know, but I can't put it
into the computer

03:06.493 --> 03:07.954
the way that you just said.

03:07.989 --> 03:11.793
What the hell kind of computer
can't do simple math?

03:11.828 --> 03:14.928
Can I speak to your manager?
He's at lunch.

03:14.963 --> 03:18.195
Lunch. All anyone cares about
these days is lunch.

03:18.230 --> 03:20.868
Is there anyone else in charge?
You want the assistant manager?

03:20.903 --> 03:22.474
Yes, I'd like
the assistant manager.

03:22.509 --> 03:23.442
'Kay.

03:25.578 --> 03:27.743
Hey, Taylor?

03:27.778 --> 03:29.910
Taylor? To the front register.

03:29.945 --> 03:32.814
What's up?
Oh, hey, Taylor.

03:32.849 --> 03:35.718
This is the assistant manager?
How old is she?

03:35.753 --> 03:37.423
Shouldn't you be in gym class?

03:37.458 --> 03:39.887
Sorry, what?
- Here. I got some change.

03:39.922 --> 03:42.593
Let me cover
that extra 33 cents for you.

03:42.628 --> 03:44.727
Sir, I do not want
your 33 cents.

03:44.762 --> 03:46.564
And this is not about 33 cents.

03:46.599 --> 03:48.929
This is about the fact
that I got 5 feet of rope

03:48.964 --> 03:50.469
because I want 5 feet of rope.

03:50.504 --> 03:51.965
And I shouldn't have to pay

03:52.000 --> 03:54.165
for 6 feet of rope
if I don't want 6 feet.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.442
Did you want
another foot of rope?

05:06.547 --> 05:07.744
Not again.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.766
How hard can this be?

05:56.256 --> 05:58.432
That bike goes over here.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.566
Hey! What the hell?

06:00.601 --> 06:02.260
That's mine.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.967
It belongs in the bike rack.
I was only gone half a minute.

06:06.002 --> 06:09.168
Next time, I'll lock it up
in the lost and found.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.040
Grumpy old bastard.

06:13.075 --> 06:14.173
Jeez.

06:27.661 --> 06:30.288
Not on the mirror. Mm.

06:31.929 --> 06:33.830
Hey, Otto!

06:39.937 --> 06:41.541
Okay.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.325
Hey!

07:34.156 --> 07:35.727
Don't you dare let
that little rat dog

07:35.762 --> 07:37.322
piss on my walkway again.

07:37.357 --> 07:38.961
I know it was you.
Ignore him, Prince.

07:38.996 --> 07:40.666
He's a nasty, bitter old man.

07:40.701 --> 07:42.327
And he has no idea
who's doing that.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.867
Well, it was one of you.

07:43.902 --> 07:46.298
And tell that useless boyfriend
of yours

07:46.333 --> 07:48.740
to stop stretching his groin
in public.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.140
Looks like a 14-year-old
Romanian gymnast,

07:53.175 --> 07:54.405
for God's sakes.

08:08.025 --> 08:10.058
Go on. Get outta here.

08:10.093 --> 08:11.422
Go.

08:50.001 --> 08:52.034
There he is,
the big man himself.

08:55.776 --> 08:57.270
What's all this?

08:57.305 --> 08:59.206
It's, well, retirement cake,
I guess.

08:59.241 --> 09:00.405
Call it what you like.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.308
"Have fun."

09:02.343 --> 09:05.047
"Have fun." Doing what?

09:05.082 --> 09:06.950
Well, have fun with
the rest of your life.

09:06.985 --> 09:09.084
We wanted to, you know...

09:09.119 --> 09:10.316
Celebrate?

09:10.351 --> 09:11.790
Yes! Well, no.

09:11.825 --> 09:13.286
Give you a nice send-off.

09:14.619 --> 09:17.059
"Nice."
Come on, Otto.

09:17.094 --> 09:19.094
You're the one
who decided to leave.

09:19.129 --> 09:22.262
And you did get
a nice severance package.

09:22.297 --> 09:24.429
You took me off Operations.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.299
You cut back on my hours.

09:26.334 --> 09:29.808
You made Terry,
who I trained, my supervisor.

09:29.843 --> 09:32.239
Terry, who can barely
figure out what year it is

09:32.274 --> 09:33.504
without his phone.

09:33.539 --> 09:36.683
So, yes,
I took the severance package.

09:36.718 --> 09:38.278
I'm sorry you see it that way.

09:38.313 --> 09:41.017
We all had to adjust
after the merger.

09:41.052 --> 09:43.085
But you've been quite an asset

09:43.120 --> 09:44.955
to this company
over the years, so--

09:44.990 --> 09:47.188
You have. Reliable as hell.

09:47.223 --> 09:49.091
We're gonna miss
those schedules of yours.

09:50.622 --> 09:52.523
To Otto!

09:52.558 --> 09:54.525
To Otto!

09:57.739 --> 10:00.872
Okay, Otto.
Want a piece of your face?

10:08.145 --> 10:09.749
Who's hungry?

10:12.677 --> 10:14.512
Look at this.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.217
No, no.

10:16.252 --> 10:18.450
Hey, hey, wait!
No, no, no.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.354
Hey, you cannot use this road
without a permit.

10:21.389 --> 10:24.060
I'm not parking.
I just dropped off a package.

10:24.095 --> 10:26.964
The sign doesn't say anything
about packages, does it?

10:26.999 --> 10:28.900
It says "permits"
and you don't have one.

10:28.935 --> 10:30.836
This is not a through street.

10:32.367 --> 10:33.872
Have a nice day, sir.

10:33.907 --> 10:35.302
Every time you come in here

10:35.337 --> 10:36.875
that means one of the residents

10:36.910 --> 10:38.910
can't park
in front of their homes!

10:38.945 --> 10:42.507
The other guys don't do this.
The guys with the white trucks.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.641
How come it's always
you brown guys?

10:44.676 --> 10:48.216
And I don't mean that racially!

10:54.554 --> 10:55.652
Hello.

10:55.687 --> 10:56.829
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

10:56.864 --> 10:58.226
<i>Sorry, can you hear me?</i>

10:58.261 --> 11:00.261
Yes.
<i>It's Susan.</i>

11:00.296 --> 11:02.428
Susan who?
<i>And I have great news</i>

11:02.463 --> 11:04.661
<i>about your health insurance.</i>
Oh, no, no, no.

11:04.696 --> 11:06.432
Robot, robot, robot!

11:09.734 --> 11:11.877
Well, who do I have to talk to

11:11.912 --> 11:13.912
to get this phone number
disconnected?

11:13.947 --> 11:16.046
- <i> That's Account Services.</i>
Can you transfer me

11:16.081 --> 11:17.443
or should I press a number?

11:20.415 --> 11:23.713
Well, I have been listening
to that music for seven minutes.

11:23.748 --> 11:25.517
<i>I do apologize, Mr. Anderson.</i>

11:25.552 --> 11:27.684
I would like the electricity
shut off at this residence.

11:27.719 --> 11:30.929
<i>Are you moving home?</i>
No, I am canceling the account.

11:30.964 --> 11:33.932
A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.

11:33.967 --> 11:36.429
And why can't you refund me
for the six days?

11:36.464 --> 11:38.299
O-T-T-O.

11:38.334 --> 11:40.367
Oh, it's policy.
Well, my policy is

11:40.402 --> 11:42.875
that if I'm going to pay
for six days of gas,

11:42.910 --> 11:45.911
then I will use six days of gas.

11:45.946 --> 11:46.978
Then we are done here.

11:49.851 --> 11:50.916
Idiots.

13:06.818 --> 13:09.126
Okay.

13:09.161 --> 13:11.623
Go, go, go. Stop. Go.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.163
Okay. Yeah. Stop.

13:15.266 --> 13:18.069
Back. You're in the blind spot,
be careful. Use the Force.

13:18.104 --> 13:19.466
Oh, no, no, no.
Good, good.

13:19.501 --> 13:21.171
No, you're going
on the sidewalk. Okay.

13:22.911 --> 13:24.669
Back, back, back.

13:24.704 --> 13:25.670
Go away.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.982
Stop. Stop.

13:36.551 --> 13:37.550
Ah, shit.

13:37.585 --> 13:39.519
What the hell is he doing?

13:39.554 --> 13:43.259
Yes! Exactly! That's exactly
what I was saying.

13:43.294 --> 13:45.998
Hey, you can't just drive here.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.000
I'm not driving.
Am I driving the car? No.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.332
You can't just bring a car
on this street without a permit.

13:50.367 --> 13:53.599
No, we have a parking permit.
Right here. See?

13:53.634 --> 13:55.733
What the hell's it doing
in your pocket?!

13:55.768 --> 13:58.043
Well, I'm the driver.

13:58.078 --> 14:00.914
We're renting here. Yeah.

14:00.949 --> 14:01.981
In 206.

14:05.987 --> 14:08.053
That doesn't mean
you can back the trailer

14:08.088 --> 14:10.088
up to your front door.
No, I wasn't.

14:10.123 --> 14:12.926
I was, uh, parallel parking.

14:12.961 --> 14:14.290
Parallel to what?

14:16.228 --> 14:19.427
Yeah, that, uh...
That didn't go so well, huh?

14:19.462 --> 14:21.231
I'll just give it another try.

14:21.266 --> 14:22.826
Oh, my God.

14:25.105 --> 14:27.204
- Okay.
Hmm.

14:30.572 --> 14:31.802
Good. Good!

14:31.837 --> 14:34.112
MARISOL
Keep backing away.

14:34.147 --> 14:35.575
Now go away more.

14:35.610 --> 14:38.281
Okay, I got this.

14:38.316 --> 14:40.448
The other way,
but first the other way.

14:40.483 --> 14:41.746
- Easy.
<i>Exactamente.</i>

14:41.781 --> 14:43.781
Easy, easy.
Uh-huh, good.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.751
No. No, no. What? No!

14:46.786 --> 14:49.589
No, no, no! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

14:49.624 --> 14:52.130
Stop! Stop. Get outta the car.

14:52.165 --> 14:53.758
Get outta the car.
I'm sorry.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.397
How you could make it
this far through life

14:55.432 --> 14:56.893
without knowing
how to back up a trailer.

14:56.928 --> 14:59.434
My God, a dog with one front paw
and cataracts

14:59.469 --> 15:01.469
coulda done better than that.

15:01.504 --> 15:04.472
And an automatic, of course.
Give me the keys.

15:04.507 --> 15:06.606
Oh, they're in the cupholder.

15:06.641 --> 15:08.311
It's a push-button start.

15:08.346 --> 15:09.576
No, I knew that.

15:12.944 --> 15:14.416
What the hell is that?

15:14.451 --> 15:15.945
That's the radar.

15:15.980 --> 15:18.024
The trailer's too close
to the side of the car.

15:18.059 --> 15:19.916
That's why it's still beeping,
but--

15:19.951 --> 15:21.192
Okay.

15:23.460 --> 15:24.393
Hello.

15:27.233 --> 15:28.760
Hello.

15:28.795 --> 15:31.268
What's your name?
Otto.

15:31.303 --> 15:33.171
Otto?

15:33.206 --> 15:35.536
Otto. O-T-T-O.

15:36.671 --> 15:39.078
I'm Abbie, O-T-T-O.

15:40.312 --> 15:41.806
And I'm Luna.

15:43.216 --> 15:44.743
Nice to meet you.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.070
Oh, that was good, huh?

16:04.105 --> 16:06.666
He just did it
in one shot, huh?

16:08.901 --> 16:10.538
<i>Perfecto!</i>
Thank you, sir.

16:10.573 --> 16:13.178
Anyone who thinks
they need to use radar

16:13.213 --> 16:15.378
to back up a car shouldn't
be allowed to drive one.

16:15.413 --> 16:17.314
They shouldn't be allowed
to use the radio.

16:17.349 --> 16:19.008
That's what I said.

16:19.043 --> 16:21.010
And the permit goes on
the rearview mirror.

16:21.045 --> 16:22.913
Not in your pocket!
Okay, okay.

16:22.948 --> 16:24.321
Got it.
Bye! Thank you!

16:24.356 --> 16:27.720
Thank you, sir.
That was very nice. Wow.

16:31.363 --> 16:32.560
Idiot.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.283
You guys all ready?

16:52.318 --> 16:53.581
Okay.

16:57.158 --> 16:58.784
All right.

16:58.819 --> 17:01.050
Bring your stuff, okay?

17:01.085 --> 17:02.755
Come on, sweeties.

17:07.795 --> 17:09.960
<i>Chiquitita,</i> take your stuff.

17:45.668 --> 17:48.603
<i>How much more shelf space</i>
<i>is left?</i>

17:48.638 --> 17:50.242
<i>Three shelves.</i>

17:50.277 --> 17:51.903
How many more boxes of books
do you have?

17:51.938 --> 17:53.344
Seven or eight.

17:53.379 --> 17:55.313
"Then I'll build you
another bookcase."

17:55.348 --> 17:57.117
<i>Then I'll build you</i>
<i>another bookcase.</i>

18:13.630 --> 18:14.695
- Hi.
Hey.

18:14.730 --> 18:16.796
Hi. Otto.

18:16.831 --> 18:18.369
Right? Yes?

18:18.404 --> 18:20.206
Otto.

18:20.241 --> 18:22.604
Yeah, that's what I said.
No? What did I say--?

18:22.639 --> 18:25.376
It doesn't matter what you said.
Otto. O-T-T-O.

18:25.411 --> 18:27.510
Ah! Otto.
Otto.

18:27.545 --> 18:31.283
Oh, Otto. Okay, so it's the same
forward that is backwards.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.713
Otto.
It's Otto, Mari.

18:32.748 --> 18:35.045
It's just you don't hear
that name very often.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.486
I do.

18:36.521 --> 18:38.224
Okay. If we're interrupting,

18:38.259 --> 18:41.392
we can always come back.
What is it you want?

18:41.427 --> 18:43.724
I brought you some food.

18:43.759 --> 18:44.923
Why?

18:46.366 --> 18:47.794
Because you looked hungry.

18:47.829 --> 18:49.664
That's why we go
so well together.

18:49.699 --> 18:54.031
She loves to cook,
and I like to eat everything.

18:55.441 --> 18:57.804
Anyway, we just, uh...

18:57.839 --> 19:00.576
We wanted
to properly introduce ourselves

19:00.611 --> 19:03.348
because we're gonna be neighbors
and everything, so...

19:06.749 --> 19:07.880
So...
Okay.

19:07.915 --> 19:08.914
Okay.
Bye.

19:18.464 --> 19:20.233
My name is Marisol.

19:21.896 --> 19:23.302
And I'm Tommy.

19:25.933 --> 19:26.965
Otto.

19:29.277 --> 19:31.508
Are you always this unfriendly?

19:31.543 --> 19:33.939
I'm not unfriendly.

19:33.974 --> 19:35.413
I'd say
you're a little unfriendly.

19:35.448 --> 19:37.041
I'm not unfriendly.
<i>Un poquito.</i>

19:37.076 --> 19:39.285
I am not.
No? Okay, you're not.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.947
No, no, no, no.
You're not unfriendly.

19:41.982 --> 19:45.687
Every word you say
is like a warm cuddle.

19:45.722 --> 19:47.150
It really is.

19:49.055 --> 19:52.023
Enjoy it, heh.
What is it?

19:52.058 --> 19:54.025
Be careful with the salsa,
please.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.961
It's<i> pollo con mole.</i>

19:55.996 --> 19:57.732
It's really good.

19:57.767 --> 19:59.734
It's a Mexican dish.

19:59.769 --> 20:02.099
I'm Mexican.<i> Bueno, no.</i>

20:02.134 --> 20:06.136
I was born in El Salvador
because my father is from there.

20:06.171 --> 20:09.612
But my mom is Mexican, so we
went to first Mexico and then--

20:09.647 --> 20:12.879
And you?
I'm an IT consultant.

20:16.324 --> 20:17.752
Oh, I'm from Anaheim.

20:17.787 --> 20:19.050
Oh, from Anaheim.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.150
Anaheim, yeah.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.624
Yeah. El Paso.

20:23.188 --> 20:25.760
Okay, well, I have some things
I need to do.

20:25.795 --> 20:28.631
Excuse me, Mr. Otto. You
wouldn't have an Alvin wrench

20:28.666 --> 20:30.226
I could borrow, would you?

20:30.261 --> 20:31.799
You mean an Allen wrench.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.768
No, an Alvin wrench.

20:33.803 --> 20:35.572
It's Allen wrench.
- Allen wrench.

20:35.607 --> 20:37.739
It's "Allen" wrench, right?
It's Allen wrench.

20:37.774 --> 20:39.444
It's Alvin.
All morning,

20:39.479 --> 20:40.808
"Alvin wrench, Alvin wrench."

20:40.843 --> 20:42.172
Honey, it's Alvin, trust me.

20:42.207 --> 20:43.976
Everybody I know calls it
an Alvin wrench.

20:44.011 --> 20:46.682
Everybody you know is wrong.
Oh, yeah? You wanna Google it?

20:46.717 --> 20:49.421
My God.
Google it! Google it!

20:49.456 --> 20:51.654
Google it.
<i>Wikipediale. Wikipediale.</i>

20:51.689 --> 20:52.853
Give me your phone.

20:52.888 --> 20:55.460
No, my phone.
You use your phone.

21:02.326 --> 21:04.194
Do you know what size you need?

21:04.229 --> 21:05.965
Ah, just the usual size.

21:08.002 --> 21:09.672
Take the set.

21:09.707 --> 21:11.168
Thank you.
Aw, thank you.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.511
We go because you have
things to do, so...

21:22.555 --> 21:24.357
What do you want, huh?

21:41.233 --> 21:43.200
Mm! Hmm.

21:44.269 --> 21:45.235
Mmm.

22:00.956 --> 22:01.955
Mmm!

22:47.508 --> 22:49.706
OTTO'-
<i>Isn't she beautiful, son?</i>

22:49.741 --> 22:53.204
That's a Chevy engine for you.
Dependable.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.272
<i>Not enough you can depend on</i>
<i>in this world.</i>

22:55.307 --> 22:56.515
Dad, this is Otto.

22:59.850 --> 23:01.619
That's enough now, darling.

23:21.201 --> 23:23.707
Huh. Two for $8?

23:37.382 --> 23:39.855
Maybe I should just run myself
over with a car.

23:39.890 --> 23:41.494
Maybe that'll work.

23:41.529 --> 23:44.662
Found some of the flowers
you like.

23:44.697 --> 23:46.664
Pink.

23:46.699 --> 23:48.160
There was a deal on 'em.

23:49.328 --> 23:52.197
On sale. Two for 8 bucks.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.707
I'm sorry
I didn't get 'em here earlier.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.612
Got distracted.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.515
By some new neighbors.

24:05.014 --> 24:06.244
Nitwit husband.

24:08.050 --> 24:11.051
Didn't even know an Allen wrench
from one of the Chipmunks.

24:12.252 --> 24:14.527
Renters, of course.

24:16.828 --> 24:18.729
No commitment to anything.

24:20.832 --> 24:25.065
I know, I know. Maybe they can't
afford to buy yet.

24:25.100 --> 24:28.002
But what will they do
when those real estate bastards

24:28.037 --> 24:30.400
decide to tear down their house

24:30.435 --> 24:33.304
and put up more of those
ricky-ticky condos, huh?

24:33.339 --> 24:35.504
It's gonna happen.
I promise you.

24:35.539 --> 24:38.848
They're already driving
around the gates,

24:38.883 --> 24:41.114
driving right across the grass.

24:44.053 --> 24:45.822
Dye & Merika.

24:45.857 --> 24:48.088
What idiot thought
that was a good name

24:48.123 --> 24:50.486
for a real estate company?

24:50.521 --> 24:52.422
Sounds like "dying America."

24:55.130 --> 24:57.526
It is, of course.

24:57.561 --> 25:00.463
Can't even buy
a decent screw hook anymore.

25:01.807 --> 25:03.433
Or rope by the foot.

25:06.042 --> 25:07.943
Nothing works
when you're not home.

26:16.508 --> 26:17.441
<i>Next.</i>

26:21.788 --> 26:25.251
I suspect you have
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,

26:25.286 --> 26:27.286
which is a genetic enlargement
of the--

26:27.321 --> 26:28.826
I know.

26:28.861 --> 26:30.454
My father had it.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.668
Well, you'll likely be around
a good long time,

26:35.703 --> 26:38.396
but I'm afraid your
military prospects end here.

26:40.070 --> 26:42.136
<i>Next.</i>

26:48.342 --> 26:50.276
One return ticket to Pittsburgh,
please.

26:50.311 --> 26:51.981
That'll be 1.10.

26:54.051 --> 26:55.479
Thank you.

27:01.894 --> 27:03.487
Coming through.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.918
Hey, you dropped your book!

27:27.953 --> 27:29.722
Miss, you dropped your book!
Hey!

28:16.397 --> 28:18.001
Is-- Is that mine?

28:19.103 --> 28:20.971
What?

28:21.006 --> 28:24.810
Yes. I saw you dropped it,
so I...

28:26.308 --> 28:29.276
Thank you so much.
I'm halfway through reading it.

28:29.311 --> 28:31.575
I would hate
not knowing how it ends.

28:33.821 --> 28:36.580
Oh, here. Why don't you join me?

28:41.356 --> 28:42.828
I'm Sonya.

28:42.863 --> 28:44.830
I'm Otto.

28:44.865 --> 28:46.799
It was my father's name.

28:46.834 --> 28:49.758
I'm on my way
to visit my father right now.

28:49.793 --> 28:51.331
I go every Thursday.

28:59.011 --> 29:01.440
Do you take this train a lot?

29:01.475 --> 29:05.114
Oh, no, I had to come into town
for my Army physical.

29:05.149 --> 29:07.017
Oh, God.

29:07.052 --> 29:08.579
Oh, that must be so hard,

29:08.614 --> 29:10.823
not knowing what
you're gonna face over there.

29:10.858 --> 29:13.320
When are you leaving?
I'm not--

29:15.291 --> 29:16.620
Not for a while.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.525
Tickets, please.

29:24.828 --> 29:26.795
Thank you.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.302
All right, thank you.

29:30.504 --> 29:32.306
I'm afraid
you're on the wrong train.

29:32.341 --> 29:34.077
This is an eastbound ticket.

29:36.081 --> 29:37.542
I must have, um...

29:38.886 --> 29:40.853
I'll get off
at the next station.

29:40.888 --> 29:42.954
Uh, how much is it?

29:42.989 --> 29:44.219
$1.75.

29:51.690 --> 29:52.689
One.

30:03.834 --> 30:05.845
Here. I have some change.

30:11.776 --> 30:13.017
Thank you.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.287
There you go.
Have a good day.

30:24.932 --> 30:26.096
A quarter to spare.

30:27.693 --> 30:29.231
It's 1964.

30:29.266 --> 30:31.233
It's pure silver.
Oh?

30:31.268 --> 30:33.598
Keep it, then. It's lucky.

30:38.143 --> 30:39.604
Yes, it is.

31:26.851 --> 31:30.292
Hey, Otto! A little late for
your morning rounds, isn't it?

31:30.327 --> 31:31.722
No.
No?

31:31.757 --> 31:33.427
Aren't you supposed to be
at work?

31:35.266 --> 31:37.002
No.
Oh. Cool.

31:37.037 --> 31:39.664
You wanna come over
for lunch, then?

31:39.699 --> 31:41.006
Lunch.

31:42.306 --> 31:44.669
Yeah.
No, no.

31:44.704 --> 31:47.639
Well, it's pork tenderloin,
in case you change your mind!

31:47.674 --> 31:49.113
No, no, no, no.

31:50.182 --> 31:51.676
Hey, excuse me.

31:53.977 --> 31:55.614
It was you.

31:55.649 --> 31:57.187
This is a private road,

31:57.222 --> 31:59.992
and these gates are to keep down
the flow of traffic.

32:00.027 --> 32:02.159
Not so idiot drivers
can go around them

32:02.194 --> 32:03.622
and tear up the grass.

32:03.657 --> 32:05.591
Okay. You got me.

32:05.626 --> 32:07.098
I'm with Dye & Merika.

32:07.133 --> 32:09.166
I'm gonna have
the groundskeeper come down

32:09.201 --> 32:11.465
and fix that up for ya, okay?
Good as new.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.797
Even better.
You have a good one now, okay?

32:13.832 --> 32:15.568
The rules are here
for a reason.

32:20.674 --> 32:22.212
I know what you guys are up to.

32:22.247 --> 32:25.149
Okay, Mr. Anderson.
Whatever you say.

32:25.184 --> 32:27.316
Keep up the neighborhood watch.

32:29.254 --> 32:32.651
Get out here, you little bugger!

32:34.160 --> 32:35.621
Come on. Yeah.

32:35.656 --> 32:37.293
Get out here!

32:37.328 --> 32:39.790
You throw one more rock,
and I swear I'll dropkick

32:39.825 --> 32:41.693
that little rat dog of yours
right over the roof.

32:41.728 --> 32:43.134
No, I'm not throwing it
at your house.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.861
That nasty cat scratched Prince.

32:44.896 --> 32:46.698
I'm gonna kill
that piece of shit.

32:46.733 --> 32:49.734
No, you're not.
What do you care? It's feral.

32:49.769 --> 32:52.308
It's probably full of all sorts
of disgusting diseases.

32:52.343 --> 32:55.674
So are you, most likely.
I don't throw rocks at you.

32:55.709 --> 32:57.478
Andy.
- What's up?

32:57.513 --> 32:59.579
Did you hear
what he just said this time?

32:59.614 --> 33:01.416
I told you before about
how he talks to me.

33:01.451 --> 33:04.881
Get outta here while you can.
I'm not your friend.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.982
Dye & Merika said they'll get
the old people on this street

33:07.017 --> 33:08.918
into a home.
The sooner the better!

33:26.971 --> 33:28.938
Hello.
What now?

33:28.973 --> 33:31.677
I just wanted
to bring the wrenches back.

33:31.712 --> 33:33.514
I found one
that came with the furniture.

33:33.549 --> 33:35.219
Congratulations.

33:35.254 --> 33:37.551
And I made you
some<i> salpores de arroz.</i>

33:37.586 --> 33:39.454
Is that chicken and mole?

33:39.489 --> 33:42.358
No. These are
Salvadoran cookies.

33:42.393 --> 33:44.019
They were my father's favorite,
so...

33:44.054 --> 33:45.889
They're delicious.
You're gonna love 'em.

33:45.924 --> 33:48.727
Yes, because I made them.
Also, Otto, I was wondering

33:48.762 --> 33:50.597
if you have a ladder
I can borrow.

33:50.632 --> 33:52.027
Our window is jammed.

33:52.062 --> 33:53.633
Why do you need a ladder?

33:53.668 --> 33:57.065
Well, it's the one up there.
It...

33:57.100 --> 33:58.605
It won't open.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.036
And you're gonna try to open it
from the outside?

34:01.071 --> 34:02.444
Yeah. Right.

34:03.744 --> 34:05.117
I'll get my coat.

34:05.152 --> 34:06.514
Okay. Thank you.

34:08.848 --> 34:12.223
I like how his hands are waving.
Let's put the arm in.

34:14.689 --> 34:15.919
Oh, good.
Anita.

34:15.954 --> 34:18.394
Otto, hate to bother you,

34:18.429 --> 34:20.264
but we don't have any heat.

34:20.299 --> 34:22.794
Um, could you come take a look?

34:22.829 --> 34:25.335
Try bleeding your radiators.

34:25.370 --> 34:27.733
How would I go about that?

34:27.768 --> 34:29.933
By bleeding the radiators.

34:29.968 --> 34:32.100
Otto. Don't be rude.

34:32.135 --> 34:34.476
I wasn't being rude.

34:34.511 --> 34:38.414
Well, it's hard to tell the
difference sometimes with Otto.

34:38.449 --> 34:40.284
Yeah.

34:40.319 --> 34:44.255
By the way,
we just moved to 206.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.015
I'm Marisol.
I'm Tommy.

34:46.050 --> 34:47.588
Oh, welcome, honey.
Nice meeting you.

34:47.623 --> 34:49.359
I'm Anita.

34:49.394 --> 34:52.428
My husband, Reuben, is the one
who used to handle the heat.

34:52.463 --> 34:53.957
Okay.
But we always knew

34:53.992 --> 34:56.630
a day would come when he
wouldn't be able to handle

34:56.665 --> 34:58.533
things around the house
any longer.

34:59.866 --> 35:01.800
Maybe Reuben should have
thought of that

35:01.835 --> 35:04.440
when he organized his coup.

35:04.475 --> 35:07.102
That was a long time ago.

35:07.137 --> 35:08.345
A coup?

35:08.380 --> 35:10.446
It was a misunderstanding.

35:10.481 --> 35:11.744
It was a coup.

35:14.177 --> 35:18.718
Otto, can't you just go breathe
Anita's radiators for her?

35:18.753 --> 35:21.622
No. Because you don't
breathe radiators.

35:21.657 --> 35:24.196
You bleed them.
Honey, look at this ramp.

35:24.231 --> 35:25.824
Oh, that's Sonya's.
We needed this for the trailer.

35:25.859 --> 35:28.200
Put that down. Put that down!

35:28.235 --> 35:30.466
Who said you could touch that?!
Oh, sorry.

35:30.501 --> 35:32.237
All of you get outta here.
Go, go.

35:32.272 --> 35:35.163
Take your ladder and go.
Get outta here. All of you.

35:35.198 --> 35:37.869
- Okay.
- Thank you.

35:37.904 --> 35:39.002
Thank you.
Watch out.

35:40.511 --> 35:42.709
Right. Right.

35:45.681 --> 35:47.681
BOTH
Thank you!

35:52.523 --> 35:55.227
No. What are you doing in here?

35:55.262 --> 35:57.185
How did you get in here?
Come on.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.693
Come on. Go! Get outta there.

36:01.224 --> 36:03.829
No, get out. Get out of there.

36:03.864 --> 36:05.028
Come on, go.

36:07.307 --> 36:08.603
Hey.

36:12.136 --> 36:14.246
Let go!

36:14.281 --> 36:15.379
Let go.

36:18.780 --> 36:21.748
You scratch me, I'll bite you.

36:24.885 --> 36:26.918
That'll teach you.

36:30.429 --> 36:31.923
Stupid cat.

36:36.633 --> 36:37.797
ABBIE &-
Hi, Otto!

36:39.097 --> 36:41.306
O-T-T-O.

36:58.325 --> 37:00.292
Otto. Um...

37:00.327 --> 37:02.085
I loaned you my garden hose
last August.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.022
If you give it back to me, I'll
bleed your radiators for you.

37:06.828 --> 37:08.157
Come in.

37:15.342 --> 37:18.233
So those new neighbors of yours,

37:18.268 --> 37:20.840
they seem quite lovely,
don't you think?

37:20.875 --> 37:24.316
Lovely.
Yeah, well, you may have

37:24.351 --> 37:27.319
some more new neighbors
soon enough.

37:27.354 --> 37:30.179
The realty people,
they've been telling us...

37:30.214 --> 37:34.249
Reuben and I have to move out.

37:34.284 --> 37:36.526
No, that's a load of crap.

37:36.561 --> 37:38.363
They don't own this house.
You do.

37:38.398 --> 37:40.761
Yeah, well, that's what I said.

37:40.796 --> 37:43.665
They have been talking
to our boy, Chris.

37:43.700 --> 37:45.469
Ugh!
Now he's saying

37:45.504 --> 37:47.867
that I can no longer
take care of Reuben,

37:47.902 --> 37:51.101
that he needs to be
in a special care place.

37:51.136 --> 37:54.940
And I should move
into a retirement home.

37:54.975 --> 37:56.711
What does Chris know about it?

37:56.746 --> 37:58.614
He's an idiot.
He always has been.

37:58.649 --> 38:00.550
They can't make you do anything.

38:03.390 --> 38:05.819
Does he even know we're here?

38:05.854 --> 38:07.150
Of course he does.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.020
Don't let him fool you.

38:09.055 --> 38:11.330
He's still in there.

38:13.400 --> 38:17.160
Um, let me go find your hose.

38:35.851 --> 38:39.347
The whole neighborhood
is falling apart these days.

38:39.382 --> 38:40.755
They don't even have

38:40.790 --> 38:42.625
a homeowners' association
anymore.

38:44.057 --> 38:47.124
No one left
to keep things running.

38:49.029 --> 38:50.369
Not like we did.

38:57.444 --> 38:59.037
Now, just to be clear...

39:00.139 --> 39:03.107
I still haven't forgiven you.

39:03.142 --> 39:06.484
I just didn't realize you would
fall to shit so quickly.

39:07.718 --> 39:10.378
And now...

39:10.413 --> 39:14.624
they're tearing apart everything
we worked so hard to build.

39:14.659 --> 39:18.221
I haven't even left yet,
and they're trying to erase us.

39:20.126 --> 39:25.261
Well, I am not staying around
to see that happen.

39:25.296 --> 39:26.603
I'm leaving.

39:28.002 --> 39:30.365
For good.
- Anita, ready for lunch?

39:30.400 --> 39:32.202
I'm making that creamed corn
you like.

39:32.237 --> 39:34.809
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you, Otto.

39:34.844 --> 39:37.042
I'm sorry it took so long
to give it back.

39:37.077 --> 39:38.483
Um, you wanna stay for lunch?

39:38.518 --> 39:40.375
Yeah, Anita made
a pork tenderloin.

39:40.410 --> 39:42.520
No, I have a lot of things
I have to do.

39:45.921 --> 39:49.087
Reuben, what are you doing, hon?

39:49.122 --> 39:51.155
Let go.
- What are you doing?

39:51.190 --> 39:54.422
Let go.
Reuben. Reuben.

39:54.457 --> 39:56.501
Let...
What are you doing?

39:56.536 --> 39:57.964
...go.

40:09.175 --> 40:10.240
Oh, man.

40:31.868 --> 40:34.572
Try opening it
from the inside a little.

40:36.070 --> 40:38.543
It's higher than I thought.

40:38.578 --> 40:40.578
I'm a little bit dizzy, honey.

41:20.620 --> 41:21.718
Hmm.

41:23.216 --> 41:24.479
Mmm.

41:24.514 --> 41:25.689

Otto.
It was your father's name.

42:52.206 --> 42:53.271
You remembered.

42:56.639 --> 42:58.980
Did you have to go back
to the military center?

42:59.015 --> 43:02.313
No, I wanted to pay you back
for the train ticket.

43:04.317 --> 43:07.516

43:41.585 --> 43:43.893
What are you passionate about?

43:43.928 --> 43:46.060
Machines. Engines.

43:46.095 --> 43:47.556
I like knowing how things work.

43:47.591 --> 43:49.030
<i>I like knowing how things work.</i>

43:49.065 --> 43:51.736
What each part does
to make a car run smoothly.

43:51.771 --> 43:53.661
It's more complicated
than people realize.

43:53.696 --> 43:55.333
A carburetor has to mix
gas and air

43:55.368 --> 43:57.874
in just the right combination,
and then the spark plug

43:57.909 --> 44:00.470
has to ignite that mixture,
which drives the piston

44:00.505 --> 44:01.911
and the connecting rods
and the drive shaft--

44:01.946 --> 44:04.573
Where did you learn so much
about cars?

44:04.608 --> 44:06.674
From my father.

44:06.709 --> 44:09.347
It's all we really talked about.
He was a good dad.

44:10.757 --> 44:11.789
Dependable.

44:13.122 --> 44:14.517
He passed away.

44:15.795 --> 44:16.761
Two months ago.

44:19.128 --> 44:20.930
It was sudden.

44:20.965 --> 44:21.931
I'm sorry.

44:24.463 --> 44:26.430
And your mom?

44:26.465 --> 44:28.366
Don't remember her much.

44:28.401 --> 44:31.875
Just how it felt
when she was gone.

44:39.918 --> 44:41.753
Why didn't you get an entrée?

44:46.716 --> 44:48.221
I ate at home.

44:49.994 --> 44:51.125
Why?

44:52.898 --> 44:54.931
So you could order
whatever you wanted.

45:01.170 --> 45:03.632
Look, I lied to you.

45:03.667 --> 45:05.909
I'm sorry.

45:05.944 --> 45:08.879
I'm not in the Army.
I couldn't pass my physical.

45:08.914 --> 45:10.980
And if I had, at least
I'd have a job now,

45:11.015 --> 45:14.115
which is what I was counting on.
But I don't.

45:16.856 --> 45:19.087
And I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

45:20.926 --> 45:21.859
I should go.

45:39.978 --> 45:41.274
Otto!

45:48.382 --> 45:49.450
Otto!

45:52.518 --> 45:54.089
I'm coming.

45:54.124 --> 45:55.860
I'm coming!

45:55.895 --> 45:57.928
What? What do you want?

45:57.963 --> 46:00.128
What are you doing here?
What are you doing?

46:00.163 --> 46:02.130
I'm looking for you.
Well, you found me.

46:02.165 --> 46:04.759
Can you please take me
to the hospital? Please?

46:04.794 --> 46:07.498
Tommy fell off the ladder. The
ambulance just took him away.

46:07.533 --> 46:09.038
Well, you can drive yourself

46:09.073 --> 46:11.535
in that imported toaster
you call a car.

46:11.570 --> 46:13.306
I don't have a license.

46:13.341 --> 46:16.012
How old are you?
Eh? Thirty.

46:16.047 --> 46:18.014
And you don't have
a driver's license?

46:18.049 --> 46:20.214
I have a driving's permit.

46:20.249 --> 46:22.645
I just never got
to the other parts.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.647
How many other parts are there?

46:27.751 --> 46:28.816
Please!

46:28.851 --> 46:30.686
<i>Por favor.</i>

46:30.721 --> 46:33.557
Focus! Please, listen!

46:34.901 --> 46:36.560
Tommy is in the hospital,

46:36.595 --> 46:39.167
and he may be dying as we speak.

46:39.202 --> 46:41.235
So are you gonna drive me
to the hospital,

46:41.270 --> 46:43.303
or are you gonna
make me take a bus?

46:43.338 --> 46:45.536
I will drive you.
Thank you.

46:45.571 --> 46:46.944
Was it so hard?

46:48.541 --> 46:50.211
Where are you going?

46:50.246 --> 46:53.313
I'm going to get the children!

46:53.348 --> 46:55.216
The children?

47:00.927 --> 47:03.158
Pick me up, pick me up!

47:13.203 --> 47:15.302
Bam everywhere. No! No!

47:20.243 --> 47:21.572
Smack, smack, smack!

47:21.607 --> 47:23.541
These dolls.

47:23.576 --> 47:25.708
Are they some kind
of superheroes?

47:25.743 --> 47:28.282
Um,<i> luchador</i> are wrestlers.
Yeah.

47:29.384 --> 47:30.515
Wrestlers.

47:30.550 --> 47:32.781
I found a Mr. Bear book!
So I see.

47:34.422 --> 47:36.422
She wants you
to read to her.

47:37.755 --> 47:38.897
Exactly.

47:41.330 --> 47:43.429
<i>"Are You There, Baby Bear?</i>

47:45.565 --> 47:49.237
'Are you there, Baby Bear?'
Mr. Bear says.

47:49.272 --> 47:51.800
'Where, oh where,
is my Baby Bear?'"

47:51.835 --> 47:53.802
No, talk like a bear.

47:55.146 --> 47:57.476
Bears don't talk.

47:57.511 --> 47:58.840
Um, this one does.

48:04.320 --> 48:08.784
"'Where, oh where,
is my Baby Bear?'

48:08.819 --> 48:13.426
'Are you there, Baby Bear,
up in that tree?'"

48:13.461 --> 48:15.329
Grr!
No, it's an owl!

48:18.037 --> 48:22.831
"'There's nobody here
but baby and me.'

48:28.179 --> 48:31.279
'Are you there, Baby Bear,
deep underground?'"

48:31.314 --> 48:33.149
I'm no Baby Bear.

48:33.184 --> 48:34.744
I'm Beppo!

48:34.779 --> 48:36.284
Hi, Beppo!

48:36.319 --> 48:38.187
Do you want to see a trick?
- Yes!

48:38.222 --> 48:40.816
Actually, I was reading to them.

48:40.851 --> 48:46.195
"Actually, I was reading
to them," Mr. Bear grumbled.

48:46.230 --> 48:48.329
Say, could I borrow a coin,
Mr. Bear?

48:48.364 --> 48:50.265
Yes, yes, yes, please?

48:50.300 --> 48:52.168
Please, please, please?

48:53.468 --> 48:54.467
Yes, yes, yes!

48:56.504 --> 48:58.009
I need this back.

48:58.044 --> 48:59.505
Absolutely.

49:08.681 --> 49:10.549
<i>¿Dónde está Otto?</i>

49:17.228 --> 49:20.064
He doesn't even own the costume.
That's owned by the hospital.

49:20.099 --> 49:22.033
He's gonna have to pay for that.
LUNA &- Otto!

49:22.068 --> 49:25.465
Beppo means happiness. He
volunteers his time to be here.

49:25.500 --> 49:28.237
Otto. What the hell did you do?

49:28.272 --> 49:29.370
Nothing.

49:29.405 --> 49:31.966
<i>Abuelo</i> Otto hit the clown.

49:32.001 --> 49:33.902
I did not.
Yeah, you did.

49:33.937 --> 49:36.212
<i>Abuelo  Luchadoro!</i>

49:36.247 --> 49:38.148
<i>Luchadoro!</i>

49:38.183 --> 49:40.579
It was all the clown's fault.

49:41.846 --> 49:44.583
Where is it going?

49:49.018 --> 49:50.358
Here it go--

49:50.393 --> 49:51.557
Blow.

49:56.399 --> 49:59.367
Wow! Here it is!

49:59.402 --> 50:01.435
How'd you do that?
Oh, it's magic.

50:01.470 --> 50:03.206
Thank you.

50:03.241 --> 50:05.340
I hope you have a magical day!

50:05.375 --> 50:06.836
Bye!
Bye, Beppo!

50:06.871 --> 50:08.706
Thank you.
Hang on.

50:11.414 --> 50:13.007
This isn't my quarter.

50:13.042 --> 50:14.910
Well, it came
from your ear, sir,

50:14.945 --> 50:17.550
so that's a you problem, heh!

50:17.585 --> 50:19.123
No, this isn't my quarter.

50:19.158 --> 50:21.422
"No, no, no.
This is not your quarter."

50:23.261 --> 50:24.953
Look.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

50:24.988 --> 50:27.098
I gave you a quarter
that I said I needed back.

50:27.133 --> 50:29.133
You want a dollar?
And you switched them on me.

50:29.168 --> 50:30.893
The ol' switcheroo.
You gave me this quarter.

50:30.928 --> 50:32.763
Is Otto going
to get in trouble?

50:32.798 --> 50:34.369
- It's just a quarter.
No, it's not.

50:34.404 --> 50:36.767
Do you see the copper?
He's not calling the coppers.

50:36.802 --> 50:38.769
I gave you a 1964 quarter.
Please calm down.

50:38.804 --> 50:40.276
I want it back! Where is it?

50:40.311 --> 50:42.245
You have it on you.
Officer, help me.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.214
129. We have a clown situation.

50:44.249 --> 50:45.281
Where is it?

50:45.316 --> 50:46.777
Let go of the clown! Sir! Sir!

50:46.812 --> 50:48.779
Aha! 1964.

50:56.690 --> 50:58.228
Where's my toy?

50:58.263 --> 50:59.790
It's in your backpack.

50:59.825 --> 51:02.232
What pocket?
There's a million pockets.

51:03.631 --> 51:04.795
What?

51:07.030 --> 51:09.030
My father used to smile
like that.

51:10.473 --> 51:12.341
I'm not smiling.

51:12.376 --> 51:13.804
Exactly.

51:13.839 --> 51:16.070
You should never be mean
to a clown.

51:16.105 --> 51:17.742
What about Alvin Wrench,
is he coming?

51:17.777 --> 51:19.106
Look!
Hey, guys!

51:19.141 --> 51:20.910
Mom, there he is! Yay!

51:20.945 --> 51:23.154
Pull the car up, please,
so we pick him up.

51:23.189 --> 51:24.815
Otto!

51:30.295 --> 51:32.790
- Thanks for driving us.
- Bye,<i> Abuelo Luchadoro.</i>

51:32.825 --> 51:34.627
- Thank you, Otto.
Okay, good night.

51:34.662 --> 51:37.201
- Bye!
- Thanks again, Otto.

51:37.236 --> 51:38.301
Bye, then.

51:38.336 --> 51:39.830
All right, ladies.

51:39.865 --> 51:42.129
Let's go.

51:42.164 --> 51:45.737
Look at your new leg!
It looks like a robot leg.

52:08.091 --> 52:09.398
Otto!

52:12.062 --> 52:13.732
Oh, my God, is he dead?

52:13.767 --> 52:15.866
No, he's probably sleeping.

52:15.901 --> 52:17.538
Otto. No, no, no, please.

52:17.573 --> 52:19.375
Please. Please.
Take him out. Please.

52:19.410 --> 52:21.212
No, why can't you?

52:21.247 --> 52:22.708
Because I'm pregnant.

52:22.743 --> 52:24.248
I cannot handle the cats

52:24.283 --> 52:25.711
because I can get
the toxo thing.

52:25.746 --> 52:27.383
Well, he got himself in there.

52:27.418 --> 52:30.848
He can get himself out of there.

52:30.883 --> 52:32.322
Why are you like that?

52:32.357 --> 52:33.752
I'm not good with cats.

52:33.787 --> 52:35.490
Hey, man. What's going on?

52:35.525 --> 52:38.328
Jimmy. Jimmy. We have a...

52:38.363 --> 52:40.231
Oh, no!

52:40.266 --> 52:41.991
We gotta warm you up, buddy!

52:42.026 --> 52:43.564
Oh, yeah. Oh, be careful.

52:43.599 --> 52:44.994
Oh, no.

52:45.029 --> 52:46.501
Oh, I've got you.

52:46.536 --> 52:48.162
He's so cold.

52:48.197 --> 52:51.836
Where do we go?
No. But no. Toxo. Otto.

52:51.871 --> 52:55.202
Oh, okay, let's go.
Shh, I've got you now.

52:55.237 --> 52:56.742
Otto. Open the door.

52:56.777 --> 52:58.381
Oh, it's all right, buddy.

52:58.416 --> 53:00.647
It's gonna be okay,<i> chiquitito.</i>
Poor guy.

53:02.882 --> 53:04.387
Okay. You're okay.

53:04.422 --> 53:06.554
Snow all over my floor.
Oh, sorry.

53:06.589 --> 53:09.887
Oh, my God,
it's so freezing here.

53:09.922 --> 53:12.186
Okay, how about this one?
Please?

53:12.221 --> 53:14.760
No, no. Don't touch that coat.
It'll stay here.

53:14.795 --> 53:17.301
Okay. Can you please
bring a blanket?

53:17.336 --> 53:19.600
For the cat?
It's okay. I got this.

53:19.635 --> 53:21.734
What are you doing?

53:21.769 --> 53:23.274
Oh, body heat works wonders.

53:23.309 --> 53:25.573
I've got plenty of body
and heat.

53:25.608 --> 53:27.311
I'm gonna turn on the oven.

53:27.346 --> 53:29.808
You are not putting that cat
in my oven.

53:29.843 --> 53:32.976
No, I'm just trying to get
some heat in the house.

53:38.016 --> 53:41.820
Your counters are so low.
Where did you get them?

53:41.855 --> 53:43.393
I built them.

53:43.428 --> 53:45.296
For Sonya. For my wife.

53:46.365 --> 53:48.090
Ah, is she short too?

53:49.159 --> 53:50.631
Sonya passed away.

53:52.470 --> 53:55.163
She was a great cook though,
wasn't she?

53:55.198 --> 53:57.539
I used to eat here
all the time.

53:58.773 --> 53:59.805
Oh.

54:00.841 --> 54:01.939
I'm sorry.

54:03.679 --> 54:05.448
Well, can you go now?

54:05.483 --> 54:07.043
I have things to do.

54:08.552 --> 54:12.081
Well, it was great seeing ya,
as usual.

54:12.116 --> 54:14.688
Oh, hey, who's gonna
look after this guy?

54:14.723 --> 54:16.019
You are.

54:16.054 --> 54:18.659
Aww...

54:18.694 --> 54:20.298
Okay.

54:27.736 --> 54:29.604
<i>Now ask me the right way.</i>

54:35.744 --> 54:38.305
It was so beautiful too.

54:38.340 --> 54:41.550
Okay, now I'm hungry.
Now I'm hungry.

54:47.085 --> 54:48.249
Let's see.

54:51.496 --> 54:54.497
"The Board of Regents hereby
certifies that Otto Anderson,

54:54.532 --> 54:56.367
having completed
all the requirements

54:56.402 --> 54:58.369
for a Bachelor's Degree
in Engineering--"

54:58.404 --> 54:59.997
Would you ever wanna...

55:01.066 --> 55:02.406
get married?

55:04.036 --> 55:05.904
'Cause if you did...
Look at me.

55:09.074 --> 55:10.843
Now ask me the right way.

55:13.716 --> 55:15.078
Will you...?

55:19.623 --> 55:20.754
Will you marry me?

55:20.789 --> 55:21.986
Yes.

55:22.021 --> 55:23.284
Yes!

55:24.595 --> 55:25.726
Yes.

55:27.290 --> 55:28.597
SONYA
Yes.

55:33.637 --> 55:35.967
Yes! Yes!

56:30.353 --> 56:32.925
- Oh, my God!
- Someone call 911.

56:35.160 --> 56:37.094
He fell down!
Somebody help him!

56:37.129 --> 56:39.063
Get the camera on him.
No, take video.

56:39.098 --> 56:40.801
Oh, for God's sake.

56:40.836 --> 56:43.067
Who's gonna do something?
Oh, my God, he fell.

56:43.102 --> 56:44.475
Get him off the tracks.
Somebody help.

56:44.510 --> 56:47.742
Hey! Can you move?

56:47.777 --> 56:50.745
You gotta move! Come on!
You gotta get up!

56:50.780 --> 56:52.780
Will somebody help me?

56:54.718 --> 56:58.522
Come on.
- Film it, film it.

56:58.557 --> 57:00.854
Get the shot.
I have him. I see him.

57:03.023 --> 57:05.089
Zoom in on his face.
- Tell me what happened.

57:05.124 --> 57:08.059
We were going to the museum...

57:18.467 --> 57:19.972
<i>Look at me.</i>

57:20.007 --> 57:21.039
Say hello.

57:21.074 --> 57:22.546
<i>Take a breath, Otto.</i>

57:25.243 --> 57:26.880
<i>Take my hand.</i>

57:26.915 --> 57:28.981
Take my hand.

57:29.016 --> 57:30.719
Take my hand now!

57:40.258 --> 57:43.391
Hey, are you out of your mind?
You could have been killed.

57:43.426 --> 57:44.964
Sir, you saved his life.

57:44.999 --> 57:46.636
He saved that guy's life.

57:46.671 --> 57:48.803
You're amazing. Oh, my God.

57:48.838 --> 57:51.575
- That was amazing.

57:57.209 --> 57:59.550
Whatever. Follow us.
Anyway, follow us.

58:18.461 --> 58:19.702
Hey!

58:23.609 --> 58:25.939
Are you trying
to scare me to death?

58:25.974 --> 58:27.710
Look at this.

58:27.745 --> 58:32.110
Um, Abbie wanted to make
a picture of her new neighbor.

58:32.145 --> 58:33.617
She wants you to have that.

58:34.950 --> 58:36.411
That's you.

58:36.446 --> 58:38.886
She always draws you in color.

58:38.921 --> 58:42.351
What do you mean, "always"?
Hm? Mm!

58:42.386 --> 58:44.254
I have a very good idea.

58:44.289 --> 58:46.091
You can be
my driver's instructor.

58:47.556 --> 58:49.094
No.

58:49.129 --> 58:50.458
No, no, no.

58:50.493 --> 58:53.296
I don't have time for that.

58:53.331 --> 58:56.805
But don't worry, I'll pay
for the gas and everything.

58:56.840 --> 59:00.809
Hey, there you guys are. I've
been looking for ya everywhere.

59:00.844 --> 59:02.613
Hi, Jimmy. What are you doing?

59:02.648 --> 59:04.109
Cat in there?
Yeah.

59:04.144 --> 59:06.309
Oh, jeez! Calm down, dude.

59:06.344 --> 59:08.476
He really doesn't like this.

59:08.511 --> 59:10.786
Let him out of the box.

59:10.821 --> 59:13.118
Okay. Sorry, buddy.

59:15.925 --> 59:17.628
What do you think
you were doing?

59:17.663 --> 59:19.256
Taking him for a walk?

59:19.291 --> 59:22.457
Well, I had to bring him back.
I forgot that I'm allergic.

59:22.492 --> 59:23.667
So...

59:23.702 --> 59:25.933
Oh, Jimmy.
Yeah. Yeah.

59:25.968 --> 59:28.595
I put oatmeal on it,
and it didn't help at all.

59:28.630 --> 59:30.300
You know what, you come with me.

59:30.335 --> 59:32.973
Because Tommy has
a prescription from last year.

59:33.008 --> 59:35.173
He found a wasp's nest.
Are you sure?

59:35.208 --> 59:36.779
I don't want to be a bother.
It's okay.

59:36.814 --> 59:38.847
Don't scratch.
I feel like I should scratch.

59:38.882 --> 59:41.146
Hey, hey, what about the cat?

59:41.181 --> 59:43.852
Uh, looks like
he's yours now, Otto.

59:43.887 --> 59:45.216
Love him.

1:00:00.365 --> 1:00:01.738
Get in the box.

1:00:04.402 --> 1:00:05.467
Get in the box.

1:00:10.749 --> 1:00:12.309
Get in the box.

1:00:21.485 --> 1:00:24.354
Sorry I haven't come yet.

1:00:27.557 --> 1:00:30.525
It's been harder
than I thought to...

1:00:36.599 --> 1:00:38.401
And now he's moved in.

1:00:43.782 --> 1:00:45.243
I have a cat.

1:00:47.951 --> 1:00:50.347
I have to figure out
what to do with him.

1:00:52.417 --> 1:00:55.088
Then I'll come to you, Sonya.
I promise.

1:00:57.389 --> 1:00:58.696
I miss you.

1:01:02.394 --> 1:01:06.396
<i>♪ And I finally see ♪</i>

1:01:06.431 --> 1:01:11.104
<i>♪ How your love</i>

1:01:11.139 --> 1:01:14.877

1:01:17.244 --> 1:01:21.477

1:01:28.486 --> 1:01:29.958
Oh, no, no, no.

1:01:29.993 --> 1:01:32.290
You are not taking over my bed.

1:01:32.325 --> 1:01:36.096
This is your bed.

1:01:36.131 --> 1:01:39.033
Would you rather
sleep outside,

1:01:39.068 --> 1:01:40.430
back in the snow?

1:01:40.465 --> 1:01:42.234
That can be arranged.

1:01:52.180 --> 1:01:55.412
You'll be the best dad our
children could ever hope for.

1:02:30.185 --> 1:02:31.613
Hey! Hey!

1:02:31.648 --> 1:02:32.823
What?

1:02:32.858 --> 1:02:35.089
Is this what you use
that bike for?

1:02:35.124 --> 1:02:36.684
Yeah. It's my job.

1:02:36.719 --> 1:02:39.159
Waiting tables and pumping gas,
that's a job.

1:02:39.194 --> 1:02:41.128
I also work nights
at a pizza shop

1:02:41.163 --> 1:02:43.097
and weekends at a thrift store,
so...

1:02:43.132 --> 1:02:45.759
Oh. Well...

1:02:45.794 --> 1:02:48.168
You're Mr. Anderson,
aren't you?

1:02:49.666 --> 1:02:52.205
You used to come
do presentations at school.

1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:53.976
When was that?

1:02:54.011 --> 1:02:56.077
Mrs. Anderson was my teacher.

1:02:58.312 --> 1:03:01.181
She was the first person that
didn't treat me like a freak

1:03:01.216 --> 1:03:02.853
'cause I'm transgender.

1:03:05.154 --> 1:03:08.221
She was the first
to call me by my new name.

1:03:08.256 --> 1:03:10.487
She got the other teachers
to do it too.

1:03:12.755 --> 1:03:14.425
It really helped me at school.

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.835
I won't
leave these here anymore.

1:03:19.905 --> 1:03:20.838
Hey.

1:03:22.908 --> 1:03:25.073
What's your name?

1:03:25.108 --> 1:03:27.207
Malcolm.
Malcolm.

1:03:27.242 --> 1:03:28.472
Otto.

1:03:28.507 --> 1:03:30.210
Nice to meet you, Otto.

1:03:35.613 --> 1:03:37.415
- Hey!

1:03:38.682 --> 1:03:41.386
Whoa, whoa!
Otto! Good news.

1:03:41.421 --> 1:03:43.421
Andy's teaching me how to drive.

1:03:43.456 --> 1:03:45.896
The wrong way.

1:03:45.931 --> 1:03:46.897
Thank you.
Of course.

1:03:46.932 --> 1:03:48.360
This was great.
Perfect.

1:03:48.395 --> 1:03:49.933
All right.
Okay.

1:03:49.968 --> 1:03:52.694
Bye.
Bye. Whoa, park!

1:03:52.729 --> 1:03:55.433
You're still in drive!
It's an automatic.

1:03:55.468 --> 1:03:58.436
You were still in drive.
You gotta put it into park.

1:03:58.471 --> 1:04:00.372
In what?
Mm. Mm.

1:04:02.244 --> 1:04:04.178
Bye! Bye.

1:04:04.213 --> 1:04:05.707
Mm.

1:04:07.876 --> 1:04:09.051
Help!
I'm coming!

1:04:11.814 --> 1:04:13.924
Saving the princess!

1:04:13.959 --> 1:04:16.718
All right. Coming!
Otto!

1:04:16.753 --> 1:04:18.126
Otto's here!

1:04:18.161 --> 1:04:19.556
My mom made<i> salpores.</i>
Whoo-hoo!

1:04:19.591 --> 1:04:21.261
Hey, Otto. Come in.

1:04:21.296 --> 1:04:23.032
I can't stand
watching one idiot

1:04:23.067 --> 1:04:24.968
teach another how to drive.
You.

1:04:25.003 --> 1:04:27.234
Put on your coat.
It's lesson time.

1:04:27.269 --> 1:04:29.434
What?<i> ¿Que?</i>

1:04:29.469 --> 1:04:31.898
You're gonna teach me? Really?

1:04:31.933 --> 1:04:34.703
Otto, thank you!

1:04:34.738 --> 1:04:36.804
Mm.
Thank you.

1:04:38.841 --> 1:04:40.379
I'll be right out!

1:04:40.414 --> 1:04:42.150
That's really,
really nice of you, Otto.

1:04:42.185 --> 1:04:44.218
Thank you.
Mm-hm.

1:04:44.253 --> 1:04:45.879
I tried once.

1:04:47.157 --> 1:04:49.619
You guys, okay.
Bye, Otto!

1:04:49.654 --> 1:04:53.227
Mama's going on a ride.
Be careful, honey.

1:04:53.262 --> 1:04:54.789
- Bye, Mama!
Bye,<i> mi vida.</i>

1:04:54.824 --> 1:04:57.066
- Have fun, guys!
Okay.

1:04:57.101 --> 1:05:00.333
Bye, Mama!
All right.

1:05:00.368 --> 1:05:02.533
No more grown-ups. Come on!
Yay!

1:05:03.866 --> 1:05:05.635
Ah, Otto,<i> pero...</i>

1:05:05.670 --> 1:05:07.109
can we go in our car?

1:05:07.144 --> 1:05:09.606
Because I've only ever
driven automatic.

1:05:09.641 --> 1:05:10.640
No.

1:05:10.675 --> 1:05:12.576
I'm teaching you how to drive.

1:05:12.611 --> 1:05:13.643
Get in.

1:05:14.679 --> 1:05:15.711
Ah,<i> bueno.</i>

1:05:17.979 --> 1:05:19.946
Now, coming up
on the red light.

1:05:19.981 --> 1:05:21.519
You're going to have to stop.

1:05:21.554 --> 1:05:23.455
Okay, but I get the clutch,
right?

1:05:23.490 --> 1:05:26.359
You get the clutch
and then press in on the brake.

1:05:26.394 --> 1:05:29.527
Do I hit the brake or clutch?
No, keep the clutch in.

1:05:29.562 --> 1:05:31.529
Put in the brake,
I put the clutch.

1:05:31.564 --> 1:05:33.531
Clutch and brake.
And now brake.

1:05:33.566 --> 1:05:35.104
Brake. Brake.
No. No.

1:05:36.536 --> 1:05:39.042
Don't shout at me.
I am not shouting at you.

1:05:39.077 --> 1:05:42.309
Clutch in. It's in, it's in!
We're going to stop, and...

1:05:42.344 --> 1:05:43.376
Clutch in, and brake.

1:05:43.411 --> 1:05:45.708
Ah, no!
Brake. Brake. Brake.

1:05:45.743 --> 1:05:49.184
The car is stopped.
Don't hit the car! Brake, brake!

1:05:49.219 --> 1:05:51.648
Yes. All right, let go.

1:05:51.683 --> 1:05:53.452
Oh, my God.

1:05:53.487 --> 1:05:55.124
Brake.

1:05:55.159 --> 1:05:56.983
It's clutch and brake.

1:05:57.018 --> 1:05:59.194
I suck at this. Ohh!

1:05:59.229 --> 1:06:00.525
I suck.
You're learning.

1:06:02.199 --> 1:06:05.035
Oh, my God, I almost
hit the car. It's like this.

1:06:05.070 --> 1:06:07.169
It doesn't matter.
It's a hybrid.

1:06:07.204 --> 1:06:08.995
It's a hybrid, okay.
It's a hybrid.

1:06:09.030 --> 1:06:11.503
- Okay, I should go back.
- No, no, no. No.

1:06:11.538 --> 1:06:13.835
You're fine right where you are.
But I'm very close.

1:06:13.870 --> 1:06:16.002
Doesn't matter.
I don't need to go back?

1:06:16.037 --> 1:06:18.972
Just wait for the green light.

1:06:19.007 --> 1:06:21.909
And here we go.
So press in on the clutch.

1:06:21.944 --> 1:06:23.812
And give it a little gas.

1:06:23.847 --> 1:06:26.518
Slowly let out on the clu--
You're not in gear.

1:06:27.620 --> 1:06:29.092
Green!

1:06:29.127 --> 1:06:31.259
Press in on the clutch,
shift into fi--

1:06:31.294 --> 1:06:33.063
You don't have to turn the key.

1:06:33.098 --> 1:06:34.922
- Go!
Just press in--

1:06:34.957 --> 1:06:37.529
Oh, my God.
Press in on the--

1:06:37.564 --> 1:06:39.333
Slowly let out the clutch,

1:06:39.368 --> 1:06:40.763
then press the gas.
I can't do this.

1:06:40.798 --> 1:06:43.931
That is all you have to do.
I can't do this.

1:06:43.966 --> 1:06:47.000
No, Otto. Otto, no.

1:06:47.035 --> 1:06:49.706
What? Oh, shit.

1:06:49.741 --> 1:06:51.004
What is wrong with you?

1:06:51.039 --> 1:06:53.380
She's learning how to drive.

1:06:53.415 --> 1:06:55.514
Did you not have to learn
how to drive?

1:06:55.549 --> 1:06:58.748
Calm down, old man. Hey, hey.

1:06:58.783 --> 1:07:03.016
I'm not your old man!
You son of a bitch!

1:07:03.051 --> 1:07:05.590
If you honk that horn
one more time,

1:07:05.625 --> 1:07:08.758
it'll be the last thing you do.
You hear me? Huh?

1:07:08.793 --> 1:07:10.595
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

1:07:12.335 --> 1:07:13.565
Oh, shit.

1:07:17.175 --> 1:07:19.241
Now you listen to me.

1:07:19.276 --> 1:07:22.772
You have given birth to two
children. Soon it'll be three.

1:07:22.807 --> 1:07:26.710
You have come here
from a country very far away.

1:07:26.745 --> 1:07:28.382
You learned a new language,

1:07:28.417 --> 1:07:30.978
you got yourself an education
and a nitwit husband

1:07:31.013 --> 1:07:33.123
and you are holding
that family together.

1:07:33.158 --> 1:07:35.719
You will have no problem
learning how to drive.

1:07:35.754 --> 1:07:37.952
My God, the world is full
of complete idiots

1:07:37.987 --> 1:07:39.723
who have managed
to figure it out,

1:07:39.758 --> 1:07:41.494
and you are not
a complete idiot.

1:07:45.170 --> 1:07:47.302
So...

1:07:47.337 --> 1:07:49.238
Clutch.

1:07:49.273 --> 1:07:50.998
Shift.

1:07:51.033 --> 1:07:52.175
Gas.

1:07:53.475 --> 1:07:54.606
Drive.

1:08:04.189 --> 1:08:05.353
Yeah.

1:08:10.492 --> 1:08:13.020
<i>Que bueno.</i>
<i>Que bueno.</i>

1:08:15.299 --> 1:08:17.629
Okay, there's a spot
right there.

1:08:17.664 --> 1:08:21.369
Just pull up, parallel,
and back the car up

1:08:21.404 --> 1:08:24.933
until that bumper is in line
with your side-view mirror.

1:08:24.968 --> 1:08:28.101
- Yes...
Now straighten out.

1:08:28.136 --> 1:08:29.872
Back up all the way
to the curb.

1:08:32.580 --> 1:08:34.712
- A little bit.
Well, a little bit.

1:08:34.747 --> 1:08:36.813
And stop.

1:08:36.848 --> 1:08:37.847
Neutral.

1:08:39.323 --> 1:08:40.355
Brake.

1:08:40.390 --> 1:08:41.455
Key.

1:08:44.493 --> 1:08:45.690
Is that it?

1:08:45.725 --> 1:08:46.823
That's it.

1:08:48.332 --> 1:08:49.529
And we're right on time.

1:08:50.862 --> 1:08:52.235
I have it.

1:08:53.535 --> 1:08:55.029
Uh-huh.

1:08:55.064 --> 1:08:56.668
These are semlors.

1:08:58.936 --> 1:09:01.673
Swedish éclairs.
Oh!

1:09:01.708 --> 1:09:03.741
They're a little messy.

1:09:03.776 --> 1:09:05.248
But let's try.
Yes.

1:09:05.283 --> 1:09:07.274
With your finger, hmm?

1:09:11.553 --> 1:09:14.081
Mm-hm!
Mm?

1:09:14.116 --> 1:09:16.292
How did you find this place?

1:09:17.394 --> 1:09:19.361
This was Sonya's place.
Mm.

1:09:21.057 --> 1:09:23.563
We used to come here
every Saturday at- 00.

1:09:24.731 --> 1:09:27.996
Mm. And then? What?

1:09:28.031 --> 1:09:29.371
Go home at- 00.

1:09:30.572 --> 1:09:32.605
I'd wash and wax the car,

1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:35.245
and she would
grade her papers and cook

1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:37.775
and spend the rest of the day
reading.

1:09:37.810 --> 1:09:39.249
What kind of books?

1:09:40.384 --> 1:09:42.846
Her books.

1:09:42.881 --> 1:09:45.585
I tried to read
some of them, but...

1:09:45.620 --> 1:09:47.389
I'm just...

1:09:47.424 --> 1:09:49.116
I'm not into books.

1:09:49.151 --> 1:09:52.328
Her friends said that
we were like night and day.

1:09:55.300 --> 1:09:58.730
My life was black-and-white
before I met Sonya.

1:09:58.765 --> 1:10:00.160
She was the color.

1:10:03.605 --> 1:10:05.066
I would have liked her.

1:10:05.101 --> 1:10:07.541
She was a force of nature.

1:10:07.576 --> 1:10:10.577
She convinced the school
to start up a special program

1:10:10.612 --> 1:10:12.315
for the kids
that needed extra help.

1:10:12.350 --> 1:10:14.614
A lot of kids
had problems at home

1:10:14.649 --> 1:10:17.782
or, uh, social anxieties.

1:10:17.817 --> 1:10:21.148
But by the time Sonya
was done with 'em,

1:10:21.183 --> 1:10:23.183
they were reciting Shakespeare.

1:10:26.661 --> 1:10:29.992
I ran into one of her students,

1:10:30.027 --> 1:10:31.631
just the other day.

1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:35.536
A kid named Malcolm.

1:10:41.511 --> 1:10:42.972
You need more cream.

1:10:43.007 --> 1:10:44.380
Okay.

1:10:48.518 --> 1:10:50.815
<i>We all got along fine,</i>
<i>of course,</i>

1:10:50.850 --> 1:10:52.982
<i>when we first moved in.</i>

1:10:53.017 --> 1:10:54.357
<i>It was like a gift.</i>

1:10:54.392 --> 1:10:56.326
Welcome to the neighborhood.

1:10:56.361 --> 1:10:58.427
Hi, I'm Sonya.
I'm Anita.

1:10:58.462 --> 1:11:01.089
<i>Sonya and Anita were</i>
<i>best friends.</i>

1:11:01.124 --> 1:11:03.091
So I got my Allen keys...

1:11:03.126 --> 1:11:05.599
<i>And Reuben and I were</i>
<i>a lot alike.</i>

1:11:05.634 --> 1:11:07.667
Hey! Slow down!

1:11:07.702 --> 1:11:09.636
<i>About most things.</i>

1:11:09.671 --> 1:11:10.703
Idiot.

1:11:10.738 --> 1:11:12.540
<i>But people change.</i>

1:11:12.575 --> 1:11:15.169
<i>Or they don't change.</i>

1:11:15.204 --> 1:11:19.173
<i>Things happen.</i>
<i>People drift apart.</i>

1:11:19.208 --> 1:11:21.912
<i>They build walls.</i>
<i>They take offense.</i>

1:11:23.487 --> 1:11:24.849
<i>Who knows why.</i>

1:11:27.425 --> 1:11:29.117
<i>Maybe it was</i>
<i>all the construction</i>

1:11:29.152 --> 1:11:31.053
<i>that drove everybody crazy.</i>

1:11:31.088 --> 1:11:33.319
<i>You know, there used to be</i>
<i>a forest up on that hill.</i>

1:11:33.354 --> 1:11:35.398
<i>That's why</i>
<i>they call it Birchwood.</i>

1:11:35.433 --> 1:11:37.026
<i>Then they started building</i>

1:11:37.061 --> 1:11:38.731
<i>all those condos</i>
<i>and cut down all the birches.</i>

1:11:38.766 --> 1:11:40.799
They didn't even realize
what they were doing

1:11:40.834 --> 1:11:43.472
until we told them,
Reuben and I.

1:11:43.507 --> 1:11:45.067
But this was before the coup?

1:11:45.102 --> 1:11:47.905
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Reuben and I were friends then.

1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:51.546
After that,
all we saw were the differences.

1:12:22.304 --> 1:12:26.779
A few years later, their son,
Chris, he took a job in Japan,

1:12:26.814 --> 1:12:29.419
and I don't think he's been
back to visit them since.

1:12:31.115 --> 1:12:33.522
Reuben and he
never did get along.

1:12:33.557 --> 1:12:36.250
<i>Anyway, that's when I decided</i>
<i>to bury the hatchet.</i>

1:12:36.285 --> 1:12:37.284
Reuben.

1:12:39.123 --> 1:12:40.287
Hey.

1:12:41.664 --> 1:12:44.225
Sonya gave me this
a while back.

1:12:44.260 --> 1:12:45.930
Never found the occasion.

1:12:47.395 --> 1:12:49.934
I thought
maybe we could start fresh.

1:12:54.006 --> 1:12:56.171
Hey, would you like
to see my new car?

1:12:57.845 --> 1:12:59.042
Sure.

1:12:59.077 --> 1:13:00.879
It's a new model.

1:13:00.914 --> 1:13:02.485
Just came out.

1:13:07.987 --> 1:13:09.151
Voilà.

1:13:11.452 --> 1:13:12.660
A Toyota?

1:13:14.125 --> 1:13:16.059
You bought a Toyota.

1:13:16.094 --> 1:13:18.094
Celica GT convertible.

1:13:18.129 --> 1:13:21.163
Five-speed automatic.

1:13:21.198 --> 1:13:24.067
You gotta change
with the times.

1:13:24.102 --> 1:13:25.442
Otto!

1:13:27.039 --> 1:13:29.336
I don't know what went wrong
with Reuben,

1:13:29.371 --> 1:13:31.107
but that's when I knew
I'd lost him.

1:13:31.142 --> 1:13:33.340
I mean, a man has to stand up
for what he believes in.

1:13:33.375 --> 1:13:35.980
Even if it is an F-O-R-D.

1:13:39.282 --> 1:13:43.625
And you and Sonya, did you ever
think about having children?

1:13:47.697 --> 1:13:49.532
Well,- 00.

1:13:51.998 --> 1:13:53.195
Okay.

1:13:54.836 --> 1:13:56.066
Yes.

1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:03.876
I was wondering if you could
help us out tonight.

1:14:03.911 --> 1:14:05.878
Me and Tommy
don't get a lot of time

1:14:05.913 --> 1:14:08.045
to go out for dinner
before the baby comes.

1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:11.114
I'm not gonna drive you two
around on a date.

1:14:11.149 --> 1:14:14.953
No, heh.
We're gonna take a cab.

1:14:14.988 --> 1:14:16.790
What do you need me for, then?

1:14:16.825 --> 1:14:20.024
Mama, I did not! Why would I?
Yes, you did!

1:14:20.059 --> 1:14:21.861
Give it back!
You gotta catch me!

1:14:21.896 --> 1:14:24.567
You guys,<i> por favor.</i>

1:14:28.496 --> 1:14:32.069
And learn
to share your everything.

1:14:32.104 --> 1:14:33.708
I'm not sure about this.

1:14:33.743 --> 1:14:36.810
No. Don't be silly.
It's gonna be very fun.

1:14:36.845 --> 1:14:40.682
If you remember, Abbie has
to be in bed by- 00, okay?

1:14:40.717 --> 1:14:42.816
You're good?

1:14:42.851 --> 1:14:46.919
So, alarm code, 4491. 4491.

1:14:46.954 --> 1:14:50.186
I'm setting it to "Armed Stay."
Are you paying attention?

1:14:50.221 --> 1:14:51.891
So if you wanna go out,

1:14:51.926 --> 1:14:53.695
you just have to press
this button here,

1:14:53.730 --> 1:14:55.224
and it's disalarmed.

1:14:55.259 --> 1:14:56.962
I'll be right here.

1:14:58.097 --> 1:15:00.064
Right. Yeah.

1:15:00.099 --> 1:15:01.736
Well, you never know.

1:15:01.771 --> 1:15:03.331
Be good to<i> Abuelo</i> Otto please!

1:15:03.366 --> 1:15:04.904
ABBIE &-
We will!

1:15:08.943 --> 1:15:10.877
I don't see chocolate milk
in here.

1:15:10.912 --> 1:15:12.406
You make it with the syrup.

1:15:12.441 --> 1:15:14.441
But not too much.
It'll keep her awake.

1:15:16.654 --> 1:15:18.016
Give me milk.

1:15:18.051 --> 1:15:19.919
What is that?

1:15:19.954 --> 1:15:22.218
That's the goddamn useless
dishwasher.

1:15:23.958 --> 1:15:26.552
Dad said he wanted
to throw it out the window,

1:15:26.587 --> 1:15:28.961
but Mom said Dad isn't allowed
to open windows anymore.

1:15:34.804 --> 1:15:35.770
Head.

1:15:36.905 --> 1:15:38.641
<i>Cabeza.</i>

1:15:38.676 --> 1:15:40.566
<i>Cabeza.</i>
<i>Cabeza.</i>

1:15:40.601 --> 1:15:42.304
Good.

1:15:42.339 --> 1:15:44.878
Eyes.
<i>Ojos.</i>

1:15:44.913 --> 1:15:49.245
<i>Ojos. Ojos.</i>
<i>Ojos. Ojos.</i>

1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:52.083
Good. Arm.<i> Brazo.</i>

1:15:52.118 --> 1:15:54.316
Arm.<i> Brazo.</i>

1:15:54.351 --> 1:15:55.284
Good.

1:16:01.193 --> 1:16:03.292
I don't think
this is a good idea.

1:16:03.327 --> 1:16:05.558
Why?

1:16:05.593 --> 1:16:08.561
Because no one stands a chance
against a<i> luchadoro.</i>

1:16:08.596 --> 1:16:11.069
<i>Abuelo Luchadoro!</i>

1:16:11.104 --> 1:16:13.236
<i>Abuelo Luchadoro!</i>

1:16:13.271 --> 1:16:16.140
Mm! Grr, help me, help me.

1:16:16.175 --> 1:16:18.747
Wait, no, he started it.

1:16:18.782 --> 1:16:21.684
Ready?
Rub it and smack!

1:16:21.719 --> 1:16:24.786
Rub it and smack! Smack!
Karate chop!

1:16:36.129 --> 1:16:37.392
Huh.

1:17:01.759 --> 1:17:04.320
Wow, it's awfully quiet, huh?
Yeah,<i> sí.</i>

1:17:06.731 --> 1:17:08.621
MARISOL
<i>Hola, hola.</i>

1:17:08.656 --> 1:17:10.700
<i>Hola,</i> Mama.
Hey, guys.

1:17:10.735 --> 1:17:12.658
Hi.

1:17:12.693 --> 1:17:14.297
Hi.

1:17:14.332 --> 1:17:15.936
She was already asleep.

1:17:17.335 --> 1:17:19.500
Total? How was it?

1:17:20.701 --> 1:17:23.372
Fine.
You did a good job, Otto.

1:17:23.407 --> 1:17:25.506
You should pat yourself
on the back.

1:17:33.714 --> 1:17:36.418
Thank you, Otto.
Yeah.

1:17:36.453 --> 1:17:38.926
<i>Exit now.</i>
Have a good night.

1:17:40.193 --> 1:17:41.390
Okay.

1:17:56.209 --> 1:17:58.605
Huh. How did he do that?

1:18:05.251 --> 1:18:07.251
Hi, Otto.
Malcolm.

1:18:07.286 --> 1:18:11.090
You can't hear your chain rattle
when you switch gears like that?

1:18:11.125 --> 1:18:13.719
Yeah, my bike's getting old.
Don't blame the bike.

1:18:13.754 --> 1:18:16.722
You just have to adjust
your derailleur.

1:18:16.757 --> 1:18:19.494
My what?
Your derailleur needs adjusting.

1:18:23.236 --> 1:18:25.071
Excuse me.

1:18:25.106 --> 1:18:26.908
Hi, I'm Shari Kenzie.
Hi.

1:18:26.943 --> 1:18:29.141
I'm a social media journalist.

1:18:29.176 --> 1:18:32.408
I'm looking for Otto Anderson.

1:18:32.443 --> 1:18:34.982
Are you sure
you wanna do that?

1:18:40.924 --> 1:18:44.156
Wow. It's great.
That's amazing.

1:18:44.191 --> 1:18:46.422
You treat it right,
it'll treat you right.

1:18:46.457 --> 1:18:48.325
Here. Keep the set.

1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:50.261
Thanks, Otto.

1:18:50.296 --> 1:18:54.837
I can't believe I'm helping you
throw crap onto people's lawns.

1:18:54.872 --> 1:18:57.268
Isn't two jobs enough?

1:18:57.303 --> 1:18:58.940
I'm saving up for a car.

1:18:58.975 --> 1:19:00.337
Yeah?
Yeah.

1:19:00.372 --> 1:19:01.976
What kind?

1:19:02.011 --> 1:19:03.175
Volkswagen.

1:19:11.779 --> 1:19:13.779
Young lady,
you're blocking the garage.

1:19:13.814 --> 1:19:17.024
Mr. Anderson?
My name is Shari Kenzie.

1:19:17.059 --> 1:19:19.620
I'm a social media journalist,
and I--

1:19:19.655 --> 1:19:21.028
What is that?

1:19:21.063 --> 1:19:23.030
I have an online series

1:19:23.065 --> 1:19:24.691
called<i> Everyday Heroes.</i>

1:19:24.726 --> 1:19:27.793
What you did the other day at
the train station was amazing.

1:19:27.828 --> 1:19:29.201
You saved that man's life.

1:19:29.236 --> 1:19:31.335
You have the wrong guy.

1:19:31.370 --> 1:19:33.040
No, I don't.

1:19:33.075 --> 1:19:35.471
I've watched the video
at least a dozen times.

1:19:35.506 --> 1:19:37.011
It's you.
Video?

1:19:37.046 --> 1:19:38.441
You haven't seen it?

1:19:38.476 --> 1:19:40.278
Oh, a commuter recorded
what happened

1:19:40.313 --> 1:19:42.214
on their phone
and posted it online.

1:19:42.249 --> 1:19:44.447
Someone in the comments
recognized you.

1:19:44.482 --> 1:19:46.020
That's how I tracked you down.

1:19:46.055 --> 1:19:48.022
It's gotten
over a million views.

1:19:48.057 --> 1:19:49.859
A million? A million.

1:19:49.894 --> 1:19:52.224
Why can't people
mind their own business?

1:19:52.259 --> 1:19:55.689
Because stories like yours
are inspiring.

1:19:55.724 --> 1:19:57.900
If I could just talk to you
for a few minutes--

1:19:57.935 --> 1:20:00.397
No, now I've got too many things
I have to do.

1:20:00.432 --> 1:20:02.795
I recorded a video message
from the man you saved.

1:20:02.830 --> 1:20:04.401
You should see this. Um...

1:20:04.436 --> 1:20:06.909
- Otto! Hi!
Just pull it up.

1:20:06.944 --> 1:20:08.009
Good morning.

1:20:09.111 --> 1:20:10.407
Good morning.

1:20:12.015 --> 1:20:13.476
Uh...
So you ready

1:20:13.511 --> 1:20:15.544
for another driving lesson?

1:20:15.579 --> 1:20:17.381
Now's not a good time.
No?

1:20:17.416 --> 1:20:19.680
Hello? Hello?
Hey, I'm still in here!

1:20:19.715 --> 1:20:21.484
I didn't lock you in.
Hello?

1:20:21.519 --> 1:20:23.992
Turn the knob, open the door.

1:20:24.027 --> 1:20:26.159
Opened a door before,
haven't you?

1:20:26.194 --> 1:20:27.292
Idiot.

1:20:29.791 --> 1:20:32.033
Otto! It's me.

1:20:32.068 --> 1:20:33.232
She's gone.

1:20:34.598 --> 1:20:36.466
Good. I'm not through
with my rounds.

1:20:38.107 --> 1:20:40.041
"Social media journalist"?

1:20:40.076 --> 1:20:42.274
What the hell
does that even mean?

1:20:42.309 --> 1:20:45.508
Buncha knotheads pointin'
a camera at themselves.

1:20:45.543 --> 1:20:47.345
I thought you handled it
really well.

1:20:47.380 --> 1:20:49.380
I mean, closing her
in your garage.

1:20:49.415 --> 1:20:53.087
That was, like,
excellent strategy.

1:20:53.122 --> 1:20:54.682
Good job.

1:20:58.589 --> 1:21:02.195
Otto, also, I was thinking
you've done so much for us.

1:21:02.230 --> 1:21:03.856
I wanna do something
for you too.

1:21:03.891 --> 1:21:05.198
I don't need anything.

1:21:05.233 --> 1:21:06.529
Well, I think you could do

1:21:06.564 --> 1:21:09.037
with some decent food.
Sometimes. No?

1:21:09.072 --> 1:21:11.798
Those cookies...
The what? The<i> "salporanz"?</i>

1:21:11.833 --> 1:21:14.900
Those are not bad.
They're not bad.

1:21:14.935 --> 1:21:16.473
And, also, I was thinking

1:21:16.508 --> 1:21:18.442
that I can help you
clean out your house

1:21:18.477 --> 1:21:20.983
and clean out the front hall
in your home,

1:21:21.018 --> 1:21:24.448
and help you pack the coats and
shoes you have there of Sonya's.

1:21:24.483 --> 1:21:26.384
That's not needed.

1:21:26.419 --> 1:21:29.585
No, but it can help you
move on.

1:21:29.620 --> 1:21:31.290
I don't wanna move on.

1:21:31.325 --> 1:21:33.226
She's always gonna be with you.

1:21:33.261 --> 1:21:35.327
But you're still here.

1:21:35.362 --> 1:21:36.592
That's enough.

1:21:38.002 --> 1:21:39.661
When my father died,

1:21:39.696 --> 1:21:41.663
my mother, she stopped living.

1:21:41.698 --> 1:21:44.765
She just stopped like she used--
Stop talking!

1:21:44.800 --> 1:21:47.273
Stop it.
Okay! Don't yell at me.

1:21:48.936 --> 1:21:53.642
Why can't people mind
their own business? Idiots.

1:21:53.677 --> 1:21:55.182
Interrupting me at every turn.

1:21:55.217 --> 1:21:57.184
The more they babble,
the more they drown out

1:21:57.219 --> 1:21:59.153
the memory of her voice.

1:21:59.188 --> 1:22:02.123
I don't want
to clear Sonya from my life.

1:22:02.158 --> 1:22:03.586
She was everything.

1:22:03.621 --> 1:22:05.027
There was nothing before her,

1:22:05.062 --> 1:22:07.293
and there's nothing after!

1:22:07.328 --> 1:22:08.723
I'm something.

1:22:12.465 --> 1:22:14.663
That son of a bitch!

1:22:14.698 --> 1:22:18.766
Uh-uh! No, no, no.
Ah-ah-ah! Ah-ah-ah!

1:22:18.801 --> 1:22:21.505
Stop right there.
You stop that car!

1:22:21.540 --> 1:22:23.540
Did you leave that gate open?

1:22:23.575 --> 1:22:25.344
You left that gate open,
didn't you?

1:22:25.379 --> 1:22:26.807
You're the only one
who gives a damn.

1:22:26.842 --> 1:22:28.776
I give a damn about people
following the rules.

1:22:28.811 --> 1:22:31.449
Yes, I know.
I know all about you.

1:22:31.484 --> 1:22:34.056
There's a file on you
at the office. It's this thick.

1:22:34.091 --> 1:22:35.783
I know about your wife.

1:22:35.818 --> 1:22:37.686
How you blame whatever happened
to her on everybody else.

1:22:37.721 --> 1:22:41.492
You shut up.
Don't you say one more word.

1:22:41.527 --> 1:22:44.660
Take it easy, Otto. Look,
I'm not trying to upset you,

1:22:44.695 --> 1:22:48.037
but you really shouldn't be
living alone.

1:22:48.072 --> 1:22:50.237
I mean, we know more about you

1:22:50.272 --> 1:22:52.800
than you probably realize, so...

1:22:52.835 --> 1:22:55.638
Just look after
that heart of yours, okay?

1:22:55.673 --> 1:22:57.640
What do you know about my heart?

1:22:57.675 --> 1:22:59.906
Hey, what do you know
about my heart?!

1:22:59.941 --> 1:23:01.974
You prying bastard!

1:23:02.009 --> 1:23:03.250
Otto, Otto.

1:23:03.285 --> 1:23:04.911
Otto, what's going on?

1:23:04.946 --> 1:23:07.155
Are you okay? Do you feel okay?

1:23:07.190 --> 1:23:09.586
You wanna help me,
close the gate.

1:23:23.030 --> 1:23:24.568
Otto. Otto.

1:23:25.802 --> 1:23:27.769
Otto.

1:23:30.411 --> 1:23:32.081
Otto.

1:23:32.116 --> 1:23:34.611
Talk to me, Otto. Please?

1:23:38.254 --> 1:23:40.914
Otto.<i> ¿Qué pasó?</i>

1:23:45.723 --> 1:23:47.261
Talk to me, Otto.

1:24:01.772 --> 1:24:02.936
Otto.

1:24:06.282 --> 1:24:07.578
Otto.

1:24:25.598 --> 1:24:26.927
Thank you.

1:24:56.563 --> 1:24:58.332
It'll be cute on you.

1:24:58.367 --> 1:24:59.993
- <i> No.</i>
<i>Aw, c'mon.</i>

1:25:00.028 --> 1:25:02.171

1:27:47.734 --> 1:27:49.195
Give me your hand.

And sad.

1:31:00.157 --> 1:31:01.354
So am I.

1:31:03.666 --> 1:31:05.424
But now we have to live.

1:31:20.408 --> 1:31:21.880
What now?

1:31:27.382 --> 1:31:29.987
Malcolm.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

1:31:30.022 --> 1:31:31.824
I'm not gonna shoot you.

1:31:31.859 --> 1:31:34.156
What was that noise?
Uh...

1:31:34.191 --> 1:31:36.158
The generator blew
and the power is out.

1:31:36.193 --> 1:31:39.425
What d'ya want? It's freezing.

1:31:39.460 --> 1:31:42.571
I was hoping you might let me
crash on your couch for a night.

1:31:42.606 --> 1:31:44.100
This is not a hotel.

1:31:45.939 --> 1:31:47.708
No. I'm sorry.

1:31:47.743 --> 1:31:49.369
Why can't you go home?

1:31:52.275 --> 1:31:53.813
My dad kicked me out.

1:31:59.216 --> 1:32:01.623
There's a sofa you can use.

1:32:01.658 --> 1:32:05.088
Don't go into the dining room.
The ceiling needs repair.

1:32:05.123 --> 1:32:07.255
It's upstairs
in Sonya's old study.

1:32:07.290 --> 1:32:10.126
So why did he kick you out?

1:32:10.161 --> 1:32:12.293
Because you're Malcolm now?

1:32:12.328 --> 1:32:14.394
Yeah, because I'm Malcolm.

1:32:14.429 --> 1:32:17.232
Because I dress like this.

1:32:17.267 --> 1:32:20.873
I read too much. I don't
like sports. Take your pick.

1:32:20.908 --> 1:32:23.106
He's embarrassed
'cause I'm trans.

1:32:23.141 --> 1:32:24.503
Then he's an idiot.

1:32:26.980 --> 1:32:28.309
This is you.

1:32:28.344 --> 1:32:30.080
Try not to touch anything.

1:32:30.115 --> 1:32:31.114
Okay.

1:33:30.912 --> 1:33:32.208
Well...

1:33:32.243 --> 1:33:34.045
Good morning.
The power's still out

1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:37.081
so I cooked up the last of the
eggs while they're still good.

1:33:38.249 --> 1:33:40.216
Hope you don't mind.

1:33:40.251 --> 1:33:42.053
I have to do my rounds.

1:33:42.088 --> 1:33:44.088
Don't you at least want
some coffee first?

1:33:46.587 --> 1:33:47.861
Yes.

1:33:54.199 --> 1:33:55.330
There you go.

1:33:56.696 --> 1:33:58.740
Uh, some eggs?

1:33:58.775 --> 1:34:00.665
I wouldn't say no.

1:34:00.700 --> 1:34:02.007
All right.

1:34:19.796 --> 1:34:20.960
That can...

1:34:22.293 --> 1:34:23.523
goes in here.

1:34:26.726 --> 1:34:27.967
Hang that up.

1:34:33.700 --> 1:34:36.107
Hey, Otto! Making your rounds.

1:34:36.142 --> 1:34:38.571
You mind if I join you?
I need to get my steps in.

1:34:38.606 --> 1:34:40.441
Okay.

1:34:40.476 --> 1:34:41.750
I'm Jimmy.
Malcolm.

1:34:41.785 --> 1:34:43.147
Nice to meet you.
Aw, thanks.

1:34:46.119 --> 1:34:47.514
Yes.

1:34:47.549 --> 1:34:49.890
Yes.

1:34:49.925 --> 1:34:51.617
Hey, Otto, if you want
to slow down,

1:34:51.652 --> 1:34:53.553
we can 'cause my beats are up.

1:34:53.588 --> 1:34:54.895
Yes.

1:35:08.603 --> 1:35:10.735
Otto, did you hear
they're moving Reuben

1:35:10.770 --> 1:35:12.704
into assisted living
this afternoon?

1:35:12.739 --> 1:35:13.947
Who is?

1:35:13.982 --> 1:35:15.982
The Dye & Merika guys.

1:35:16.017 --> 1:35:17.412
My God.

1:35:17.447 --> 1:35:19.744
They convinced Anita
to sell the house.

1:35:19.779 --> 1:35:21.746
No, they made the deal
with Chris.

1:35:21.781 --> 1:35:24.485
Chris? He can't do that.
Yeah, he can.

1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:27.752
After Dye & Merika found out
Anita had Parkinson's,

1:35:27.787 --> 1:35:29.798
they tracked Chris down and--

1:35:29.833 --> 1:35:30.997
Parkinson's?
Yeah.

1:35:31.032 --> 1:35:32.757
So last year
Chris convinced Anita

1:35:32.792 --> 1:35:35.430
to give him power of attorney
in case she got worse.

1:35:35.465 --> 1:35:38.499
So Dye & Merika made the deal
with Chris to buy the house.

1:35:38.534 --> 1:35:40.908
Those pricks.

1:35:40.943 --> 1:35:44.945
Wait, Anita found out
she had Parkinson's last year?

1:35:44.980 --> 1:35:46.111
No, that's not right.

1:35:46.146 --> 1:35:47.508
She would've told Sonya.

1:35:47.543 --> 1:35:48.883
Sonya would've told me.

1:35:50.150 --> 1:35:52.249
Well, Anita and Reuben

1:35:52.284 --> 1:35:53.954
didn't want
you and Sonya to know.

1:35:53.989 --> 1:35:56.825
They said you had enough
on your plate as it is.

1:35:58.455 --> 1:35:59.861
They said that?

1:36:10.830 --> 1:36:14.139
I need to see everything
you ever got from Dye & Merika.

1:36:14.174 --> 1:36:17.307
Notices, letters. Do you have
a copy of the power of attorney?

1:36:17.342 --> 1:36:19.012
How do you know about that?

1:36:19.047 --> 1:36:20.849
Do you have it?
Yes.

1:36:20.884 --> 1:36:22.015
Get it.
Yes.

1:36:23.645 --> 1:36:28.648
And any records
of Reuben's condition and yours.

1:36:28.683 --> 1:36:30.518
Did Jimmy tell you that?

1:36:30.553 --> 1:36:32.025
Can you get it now?

1:36:32.060 --> 1:36:33.092
Yes.

1:36:38.902 --> 1:36:40.495
I've been an idiot.

1:36:42.367 --> 1:36:44.334
I got so wrapped up
in my own troubles,

1:36:44.369 --> 1:36:46.006
I stopped thinking
of anyone else.

1:36:46.041 --> 1:36:48.206
And I figured
they weren't thinking about me.

1:36:49.946 --> 1:36:51.572
Friends shouldn't do that.

1:36:51.607 --> 1:36:52.672
So...

1:36:54.412 --> 1:36:56.885
This isn't easy to say
after all this time.

1:36:58.020 --> 1:36:59.382
But I'm sorry.

1:37:02.024 --> 1:37:04.420
And I will sort all this out.

1:37:17.138 --> 1:37:18.533
I need to use your phone.

1:37:20.570 --> 1:37:23.340
Why can't you use your own?

1:37:23.375 --> 1:37:25.243
Mine is disconnected
at the moment.

1:37:27.313 --> 1:37:29.775
Why?
That doesn't matter.

1:37:29.810 --> 1:37:31.810
I just need to use your phone,
okay?

1:37:33.913 --> 1:37:36.221
You know what? No.

1:37:36.256 --> 1:37:38.784
No?
No.

1:37:38.819 --> 1:37:41.589
You won't tell me
why your phone is disconnected?

1:37:41.624 --> 1:37:45.032
You won't tell me
why you need to use my phone?

1:37:45.067 --> 1:37:48.629
You won't tell me what happened
to you in the street yesterday?

1:37:48.664 --> 1:37:51.940
And then you went inside and
you wouldn't even open the door?

1:37:53.900 --> 1:37:55.603
You scared me, Otto.

1:37:57.244 --> 1:37:59.310
Do you know how long
I was out there?

1:37:59.345 --> 1:38:02.478
And I didn't know if something
had happened to you.

1:38:03.811 --> 1:38:06.449
Or if something
was gonna happen to you.

1:38:06.484 --> 1:38:10.618
And I'm sorry if I said the
wrong thing about Sonya's coats.

1:38:10.653 --> 1:38:13.390
But I was just trying to help.

1:38:13.425 --> 1:38:16.360
And you left me out there.

1:38:18.430 --> 1:38:21.167
So, no. You can't use my phone.

1:38:27.274 --> 1:38:30.638
You think your life is so hard
because everybody's an idiot

1:38:30.673 --> 1:38:33.014
and you have to do everything
on your own, right?

1:38:34.182 --> 1:38:35.181
Right?

1:38:36.349 --> 1:38:38.349
But guess what.

1:38:38.384 --> 1:38:39.647
You can't.

1:38:40.947 --> 1:38:42.056
No one can.

1:38:43.389 --> 1:38:45.158
And I think
you should just be happy

1:38:45.193 --> 1:38:48.953
that someone was trying to help
you get through a crappy day.

1:38:48.988 --> 1:38:50.526
Even if they're an idiot.

1:38:51.727 --> 1:38:54.134
So...
The real estate bastards

1:38:54.169 --> 1:38:57.830
are trying to force Anita
and Reuben out of their home.

1:38:57.865 --> 1:38:59.799
That's why
I need to use your phone.

1:39:03.211 --> 1:39:05.211
Okay, fine. Come on.

1:39:21.493 --> 1:39:23.658
We had never had a vacation.

1:39:27.730 --> 1:39:30.038
Sonya was six months pregnant.

1:39:30.073 --> 1:39:34.306
And she wanted to do something
special before the baby came.

1:39:34.341 --> 1:39:37.507
So we booked a trip
to Niagara Falls.

1:39:39.577 --> 1:39:41.412
On the way back,
the bus crashed.

1:39:43.119 --> 1:39:45.746
There'd been a recall
on the brake lines,

1:39:45.781 --> 1:39:47.946
but the company
never had them fixed.

1:39:49.521 --> 1:39:51.356
Sonya was paralyzed...

1:39:52.458 --> 1:39:54.590
and we lost our son.

1:39:58.398 --> 1:40:01.861
<i>After three months, she was</i>
<i>finally able to come home.</i>

1:40:01.896 --> 1:40:04.864
<i>But they had started building</i>
<i>the new condos</i>

1:40:04.899 --> 1:40:08.175
<i>and the community center</i>
<i>and the walkways,</i>

1:40:08.210 --> 1:40:12.179
<i>none of which were designed</i>
<i>for people in wheelchairs.</i>

1:40:12.214 --> 1:40:15.677
The builders could have
changed their plans.

1:40:15.712 --> 1:40:20.121
But the laws weren't in place
back then, and they didn't care.

1:40:20.156 --> 1:40:21.749
<i>I did.</i>

1:40:22.983 --> 1:40:25.291
<i>I cared.</i>

1:40:25.326 --> 1:40:28.129
And I was so angry.

1:40:28.164 --> 1:40:31.297
What does that mean? People
like her? What does that mean?

1:40:31.332 --> 1:40:34.465
What're you tryin' to say?!
Get off of me!

1:40:34.500 --> 1:40:36.533
That's when they voted me out

1:40:36.568 --> 1:40:38.766
as head
of the homeowners' association.

1:40:41.067 --> 1:40:43.144
I wanted to obliterate them all.

1:40:43.179 --> 1:40:44.805
The builders, and the realtors,

1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:46.972
and the bus company,
the bus driver.

1:40:47.007 --> 1:40:48.842
I never would have let it go...

1:40:50.351 --> 1:40:51.482
but for Sonya.

1:40:52.914 --> 1:40:54.753
Sonya said
we had to keep living.

1:40:57.820 --> 1:40:59.094
That's what I did.

1:41:00.526 --> 1:41:02.020
I lived for Sonya.

1:41:06.367 --> 1:41:08.895
Six months ago
she passed away.

1:41:08.930 --> 1:41:10.501
<i>Cancer.</i>

1:41:14.177 --> 1:41:15.638
I was going to join her.

1:41:17.312 --> 1:41:19.640
That's why I had them
disconnect my phone.

1:41:22.713 --> 1:41:26.220
But now I think
she wants me to keep living.

1:41:28.455 --> 1:41:32.457
And I have things to do.

1:42:03.182 --> 1:42:04.951
You're wasting your time, Otto.

1:42:04.986 --> 1:42:07.492
It's a done deal.
Reuben's coming with us.

1:42:07.527 --> 1:42:09.626
And if you get in our way,

1:42:09.661 --> 1:42:11.496
I'll have you arrested.

1:42:11.531 --> 1:42:15.302
I'm not doing a thing.
Don't you take another step.

1:42:15.337 --> 1:42:17.799
You are not taking my husband
away from me.

1:42:17.834 --> 1:42:21.374
Anita, please. We're doing this
for your own good.

1:42:21.409 --> 1:42:25.345
What you're doing is trying
to take my property.

1:42:25.380 --> 1:42:29.679
I want Reuben to stay right here
for the rest of his life

1:42:29.714 --> 1:42:31.681
with me in our home.

1:42:31.716 --> 1:42:34.354
Okay, but who's gonna
take care of Reuben

1:42:34.389 --> 1:42:35.916
when you're no longer able to?

1:42:35.951 --> 1:42:38.424
Who's gonna take care of you?
Otto?

1:42:38.459 --> 1:42:41.427
Otto's not in the best health
either. Are you, Otto?

1:42:42.595 --> 1:42:43.759
I'll take care of 'em.

1:42:45.092 --> 1:42:47.026
What are you doing?
Put that down.

1:42:47.061 --> 1:42:48.665
Anita and Reuben are
like family to me.

1:42:48.700 --> 1:42:50.931
I'll take care of them
as long as they need.

1:42:50.966 --> 1:42:53.241
They-they're not your family.

1:42:53.276 --> 1:42:54.836
Their son, Chris, has decided

1:42:54.871 --> 1:42:56.871
they're not fit enough
to be on their own,

1:42:56.906 --> 1:42:59.511
and so what we're doing is--
Excuse me.

1:42:59.546 --> 1:43:01.711
When was the last time
Chris saw his parents?

1:43:01.746 --> 1:43:05.451
He lives in Japan. They've
been estranged for 10 years.

1:43:05.486 --> 1:43:07.849
Chris would have no idea
how his parents are doing,

1:43:07.884 --> 1:43:09.587
except for what you told him.

1:43:09.622 --> 1:43:11.523
Okay. And who are you?

1:43:11.558 --> 1:43:13.459
My name is Shari Kenzie.

1:43:13.494 --> 1:43:15.461
Social media journalist.

1:43:15.496 --> 1:43:18.365
We're streaming live right now.
Mm-hm.

1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:20.631
All right, all right,
shut that camera off.

1:43:20.666 --> 1:43:24.305
You can't film this.
It's a public sidewalk.

1:43:24.340 --> 1:43:27.066
You told Anita's son, Chris,
that she had Parkinson's,

1:43:27.101 --> 1:43:30.938
but Anita never told anyone
about her diagnosis.

1:43:30.973 --> 1:43:33.105
So how did you know?

1:43:33.140 --> 1:43:36.108
I-I'd have to check the records.

1:43:36.143 --> 1:43:39.045
Mr. Anderson over there
is something of a local hero.

1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:41.080
He tells me you know details

1:43:41.115 --> 1:43:44.325
about his private health records
as well.

1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:46.217
So how are you and your company

1:43:46.252 --> 1:43:49.594
getting illegal access to
the medical records of seniors?

1:43:51.862 --> 1:43:54.126
Okay, let's go. We're done.
We're done.

1:43:54.161 --> 1:43:55.963
Very nice to meet you.

1:43:55.998 --> 1:43:57.767
- No, you're done.
Shit.

1:43:57.802 --> 1:44:00.165
Get that camera out of my face.
- Goodbye.

1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:02.134
We did it!
Oh, we did!

1:44:04.204 --> 1:44:05.511
Bye, thank you!

1:44:05.546 --> 1:44:07.612
I first uploaded
Anita and Chris' story

1:44:07.647 --> 1:44:09.350
an hour ago.

1:44:09.385 --> 1:44:11.242
Already dozens of people
are saying

1:44:11.277 --> 1:44:14.014
Dye & Merika forced them
out of their homes.

1:44:14.049 --> 1:44:15.851
- That was easy.
Yeah, goodbye.

1:44:15.886 --> 1:44:19.283
If you have a story, share it
with me at Shari_Kenzie.

1:44:19.318 --> 1:44:22.858
I got it. I got it.

1:44:22.893 --> 1:44:25.366
Hey, you forgot
to shut the gate!

1:44:25.401 --> 1:44:28.369
You see that? He just
rolled right over. Gave up.

1:44:28.404 --> 1:44:31.504
In our day, the bastards would
at least put up a fight.

1:44:31.539 --> 1:44:33.572
They haven't
gotten rid of us yet.

1:44:42.979 --> 1:44:44.209
Yeah.

1:44:44.244 --> 1:44:46.420
It does feel pretty good.
Doesn't it?

1:44:53.825 --> 1:44:56.628
Neighborly neighbors,
a thing of the past?

1:44:56.663 --> 1:44:59.466
Well, I'm here with eyewitnesses
Anita and Jimmy

1:44:59.501 --> 1:45:00.797
to find out more.

1:45:00.832 --> 1:45:02.227
Jimmy, you mentioned

1:45:02.262 --> 1:45:04.163
that Anita and Reuben
are like family to you.

1:45:04.198 --> 1:45:05.802
What does that mean, exactly?

1:45:05.837 --> 1:45:08.838
Well, I have dinner at
their house nearly every night.

1:45:13.009 --> 1:45:14.910
I know what you're waiting for.

1:45:14.945 --> 1:45:17.044
You're ready for lunch,
aren't you?

1:45:17.079 --> 1:45:18.749
I know what you want.

1:45:21.556 --> 1:45:23.215
Whoa. Here we go.

1:45:23.250 --> 1:45:24.920
You moved
into this community recently.

1:45:24.955 --> 1:45:27.318
How has that been for you?
It's been beautiful.

1:45:27.353 --> 1:45:30.222
And your family,
to have people there that are--

1:45:30.257 --> 1:45:31.355
Yeah.

1:45:31.390 --> 1:45:33.093
Otto?
Will you air this in Mexico?

1:45:33.128 --> 1:45:34.831
Otto!

1:45:34.866 --> 1:45:37.295
Call an ambulance!

1:45:51.883 --> 1:45:53.377
Ms. Mendes?
Yes.

1:45:53.412 --> 1:45:55.720
You can see him now.
Yes. Yeah.

1:46:00.826 --> 1:46:03.321
<i>Hola, Abuelo</i> Otto.

1:46:18.074 --> 1:46:19.612
Ms. Mendes?

1:46:19.647 --> 1:46:21.108
I'm Dr. Ellis.
Ah.

1:46:21.143 --> 1:46:24.078
Mr. Anderson listed you
as next of kin.

1:46:24.113 --> 1:46:26.916
Yes. Yes, that's correct.

1:46:26.951 --> 1:46:28.280
Your uncle had a close call.

1:46:28.315 --> 1:46:30.788
Has he spoken to you
about his condition?

1:46:30.823 --> 1:46:34.055
Mm, no, not really. No.

1:46:34.090 --> 1:46:36.629
It's called
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

1:46:36.664 --> 1:46:40.028
Basically,
his heart is too big.

1:46:42.428 --> 1:46:44.164
Too big?
Mm-hm.

1:46:45.706 --> 1:46:47.739
Oh, okay.

1:46:47.774 --> 1:46:49.103
Oh...

1:46:55.441 --> 1:46:57.012
No, sorry. It's okay.

1:47:08.322 --> 1:47:10.960
You're really bad at dying,
you know that?

1:47:22.743 --> 1:47:24.644
Otto, I think it's time.

1:47:25.878 --> 1:47:26.976
I think it's time.

1:47:28.408 --> 1:47:30.716
It's time.
Oh, I'm a cardiologist.

1:47:30.751 --> 1:47:32.652
I'll page OB for you.
Ah, okay.

1:47:36.020 --> 1:47:39.219
Do something. It's time!

1:47:47.097 --> 1:47:48.734
All right, ready?

1:47:48.769 --> 1:47:50.868

All right. Ready?
Everybody say, "Marco."

Hey, Otto.

1:48:20.867 --> 1:48:24.396
Sorry, is this about the cars
that are in front?

1:48:24.431 --> 1:48:26.574
No, I brought you something.

1:48:29.073 --> 1:48:30.578
Otto.

1:48:30.613 --> 1:48:32.745
Otto.

1:48:32.780 --> 1:48:34.945
I gave it a fresh coat of paint.

1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:36.683
I love it.

1:48:36.718 --> 1:48:38.278
It's for the baby.
Yes.

1:48:38.313 --> 1:48:40.346
Thank you.

1:48:40.381 --> 1:48:42.590
Okay, hold him one second,
please.

1:48:42.625 --> 1:48:44.383
Why?
To show Tommy.

1:48:44.418 --> 1:48:46.220
Hold him. Oh, he's gonna cry.

1:48:50.424 --> 1:48:52.391

Hello. There we are.

1:48:55.165 --> 1:48:59.035
Uh, should I put this thing
back in him?

1:49:01.776 --> 1:49:03.039
There.

1:49:03.074 --> 1:49:05.206
Oh. Yeah.

Uh, well, let me...

1:49:15.757 --> 1:49:18.186
Let me show you
how this works.

1:49:20.454 --> 1:49:22.454
You don't have to do anything.

1:49:22.489 --> 1:49:24.489
Easy.

1:49:24.524 --> 1:49:25.996
Your little head...

1:49:26.031 --> 1:49:29.835
Oh. Now, we just go...

1:49:29.870 --> 1:49:31.837
like so.

1:49:31.872 --> 1:49:33.234
Huh?

1:49:58.129 --> 1:49:59.865
Sonya, this is Abbie and Luna.

1:49:59.900 --> 1:50:01.735
They have something for you.

1:50:03.365 --> 1:50:05.233
Hi, Sonya.
Hi, Sonya.

1:50:06.533 --> 1:50:09.402
That's brand-new
little Marco there.

1:50:10.977 --> 1:50:14.715
And Marisol, Tommy.
I told you about them.

1:50:14.750 --> 1:50:17.179
Say,<i> "Hola.</i> <i> Hola,</i> Sonya."

1:50:17.214 --> 1:50:19.115
She loved pink flowers, girls.

1:50:19.150 --> 1:50:20.347
You chose well.

1:50:21.647 --> 1:50:23.185
I like pink too.

No, no, no.

1:51:46.633 --> 1:51:48.171
Come on, Otto.

1:51:56.511 --> 1:51:59.050
All right, Malcolm,
check that oil. Check it.

1:51:59.085 --> 1:52:01.822

1:52:01.857 --> 1:52:03.890
Looks good, right?

1:52:03.925 --> 1:52:05.892
If you say so.
Okay.

1:52:05.927 --> 1:52:08.356
That's it. Okay, now...

1:52:09.458 --> 1:52:11.128
Here's your manual.

1:52:11.163 --> 1:52:13.427
Here's your papers.

1:52:13.462 --> 1:52:14.626

Nope.

Thank you. Oh, thank you.

1:52:24.473 --> 1:52:28.673

Let's go for a ride?
That's a nice truck, Otto.

1:52:51.038 --> 1:52:52.631
Be careful.

1:52:52.666 --> 1:52:54.303
I like your car, Otto.

1:52:54.338 --> 1:52:56.844
Yeah? Wait till you see
how it rides.

1:52:59.981 --> 1:53:01.981
It's enormous.
