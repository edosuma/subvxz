My fellow members

00:45.336 --> 00:48.715
of The Sixth Street Community
Center's Writing Workshop:

00:48.715 --> 00:51.801
Beginners through
Intermediates,

00:51.801 --> 00:53.928
you hold in your hands today

00:53.928 --> 00:58.475
more... than just
the first chapter of my novel.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.978
You also hold... my heart.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.523
Am I nervous? A little.

01:05.523 --> 01:08.401
Am I nauseous? (chuckles) Extremely.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.904
But mostly, I am excited

01:10.904 --> 01:14.574
because I know that your mixed,

01:14.574 --> 01:18.828
but largely positive feedback
is going to serve

01:18.828 --> 01:24.417
as the gentle nudge
that I need to tell myself

01:24.417 --> 01:27.587
- that I am a writer!

01:27.587 --> 01:28.797
I have something to say

01:28.797 --> 01:31.091
and the world is a better place with me--

01:31.091 --> 01:32.967
- Touch of a man.
- Okay, no.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.720
I am not letting you do this.

01:35.720 --> 01:36.805
This is my day.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.515
I just don't get it, Linds.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.309
If you know for a fact
that you're a terrible writer...

01:41.309 --> 01:42.852
I'm not a terrible writer.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.396
...then why would you agree
to share that terrible writing

01:45.396 --> 01:47.607
beyond the confines of your own sad self?

01:47.607 --> 01:51.194
Everything is telling you
the same thing, sweetheart:

01:51.194 --> 01:54.614
you made a mistake. Leaving Ned?

01:54.614 --> 01:55.990
Nothing is telling me that.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.408
You, you were almost decapitated

01:57.408 --> 01:59.369
by a falling air conditioner
two weeks ago.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.122
- That was a sign.
- I survived, didn't I?

02:02.122 --> 02:06.209
- You've been hit by three cabs.
- At very low speeds.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.627
It's time to give up

02:07.627 --> 02:11.047
whatever this prolonged
emotional breakdown is

02:11.047 --> 02:12.799
and come home.

02:13.716 --> 02:17.637
I belong here...
In this city. In this vocation.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.930
And today is gonna prove it.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.683
Everybody is gonna love my chapter.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.476
You have no reason to believe that.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.477
Is that so?

02:24.727 --> 02:26.729
How about, uh,

02:26.729 --> 02:28.398
this reason?

02:28.940 --> 02:31.067
Well, you never count the first card.

02:31.067 --> 02:34.612
Everybody knows that.
What about this reason?

02:35.613 --> 02:38.074
It's funny. The devil's actually
a very misunderstood card

02:38.074 --> 02:40.160
because it's really more
about the shadow--

02:40.160 --> 02:43.872

02:43.872 --> 02:47.292

Ten days later, your spleen has swollen

03:37.133 --> 03:39.052

03:39.052 --> 03:42.639

05:11.561 --> 05:12.729
What you've written...

05:12.854 --> 05:16.065
it made me want to get
out of bed this morning.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.484
And that's quite rare.

05:18.484 --> 05:22.739
- Oh, I-I'm so relieved that you liked it.
- Liked it?

05:22.739 --> 05:24.365
The scene in the office,

05:24.365 --> 05:26.284
when Linda manipulates Mitchell's genitals

05:26.284 --> 05:27.910
until he begins to weep?

05:27.910 --> 05:29.704
It's a tour de force.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.539
Wow, thank you so much.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.417
And then to leave us
with this delicious mystery.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.211
The central question of the piece:

05:37.211 --> 05:38.713
why did Mitchell cry?

05:41.382 --> 05:45.136
Well, you'll just have
to read chapter two to find out.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.806
I called Gil Frond
first thing this morning.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.017
He teaches Intermediate to Advanced.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.395
He agreed to consider you for a slot.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.980
Oh, my goodness.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.440
He needs a writing sample

05:57.565 --> 05:59.817
at the end of tomorrow by the very latest.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.403
Oh, well, I can just give him the chapter.

06:02.403 --> 06:05.323
Gil has a 30-page sample requirement.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.742
If you could submit
the first two chapters?

06:07.742 --> 06:12.038
Well, I, I haven't
written chapter two yet.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.123
Oh, not on paper,

06:14.123 --> 06:16.626
but I'm sure you've
got it all figured out.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.337
What sort of a writer
would you be otherwise?

06:19.796 --> 06:20.922
Right.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.802
- Jiminator!
Hey.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.804
I was actually hopin' to maybe
grab a few minutes with you.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.555
Well, I was actually hopin'
to grab a few minutes with you.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.224
I've been doin' a lotta thinkin' about

06:31.224 --> 06:32.225
- bringin' in my own business--
Uh-huh.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.518
and I put together some ideas.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.478
Well, I just took
a gander at the invite list

06:35.478 --> 06:39.440
to Chad's bachelor party,
and you are on it, man.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.777
Wow. That's... flattering.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.196
Your trainer leaving her husband
for you is "flattering."

06:45.530 --> 06:49.867
An invite to Chad's
bachelor party is monumental.

06:49.867 --> 06:53.454
His dad is the CFO of a bank.

06:54.163 --> 06:57.375
One week in Aspen. We leave
next Monday. B.Y.O. skis.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.002
Guess I... better get some skis, then.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.380
Yeah, but here's the real
head-butt in the dick:

07:02.588 --> 07:03.881
you know that company in Texas,

07:03.881 --> 07:06.134
the one that makes cattle feed
from chicken shit?

07:06.134 --> 07:08.010
- Yeah.
- Q2 numbers just came in.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.053
Not looking good.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.055
Which means we're gonna
have to run all new projections

07:11.055 --> 07:12.682
before we head out to private equity.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.892
Which means I'm gonna need ya here,

07:14.892 --> 07:15.893
building out a new deck.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.103
Oh, okay--

07:17.103 --> 07:18.604
Right, but there's no way

07:18.604 --> 07:20.189
you're missing this party.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.108
Our chalet is a who's who of

07:22.108 --> 07:24.235
who decides who makes associate.
You have to be there.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.613
But I'm also supposed to be here?

07:27.989 --> 07:29.323
I know.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.700
I get it.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.702
This is one of those unsolvable
problems that you give

07:32.702 --> 07:34.495
to analysts to see if
they crack under the pressure.

07:34.495 --> 07:41.002
"Be there, but don't be there,
but also... be there."

07:41.794 --> 07:44.130
You have until Wednesday
to come up with a solve,

07:44.297 --> 07:48.718
at which point
your invite reverts to Chris.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.222
Oh hey, Germin, go fuck yourself.

08:08.154 --> 08:12.575
Miguel?! Miguel Jimenez?! Is that you?

08:12.909 --> 08:15.703
- Oh, goddammit.
- She knows exactly who you are.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.413
No one could forget that face.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.165
Drop to the floor.
Pretend you're having a seizure.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.043
It's Lindsay! Lindsay Arthur!

08:22.043 --> 08:24.795
This is not nice, what you're
doing. Not nice at all.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.714
Talk about crazy.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.133
No one said anything about crazy.

08:29.300 --> 08:33.429
What brings you to, uh,
this... neck of the woods?

08:33.429 --> 08:36.349
I work here. In the building
we're standing in front of.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.726
Tell her your base salary.
That'll really fuck her up.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.437
That's right. I completely forgot.

08:41.437 --> 08:44.524
If she forgot, she's an idiot.
If she's lying, she's a liar.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.400
Running into you like this?
Out of the blue?

08:46.400 --> 08:49.403
I mean... this is a sign.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.740
- Conjuring a fake sign?!
- A sign that...

08:52.740 --> 08:55.368
we both live in New York
and use the sidewalk?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.995
There he is. That's my boy.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.122
Hilarious. No.

09:00.122 --> 09:05.836
It is a sign that I should
finally ask you this question.

09:05.836 --> 09:08.089
I was wondering...

09:08.089 --> 09:09.549
Why did you cry when I fumbled

09:09.549 --> 09:11.759
with your private parts
like a clumsy juggler?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.722
...if you could ever forgive me

09:16.722 --> 09:18.307
for standing you up at the diner?

09:18.516 --> 09:21.894
Not in a million years.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.187
Already have.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.898
It's just-- I, I should've told you

09:25.898 --> 09:28.609
I... I came to New York to focus on myself

09:28.609 --> 09:30.236
and then find my voice as a writer.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.405
- But seriously... seriously,

09:32.405 --> 09:34.073
don't sweat it. I certainly didn't.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.283
Yeah, he only waited at the diner

09:35.283 --> 09:37.660
- for you for an hour and a half.
- Ooh, ooh! Uh.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.870
Get her to guess your
FICO score. That'll be a hoot.

09:39.870 --> 09:43.040
And now she has a stain on
her trousers. How charming.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.417
- Just shut up.
- Fuck off.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.334
Oh.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.045
Well, excuse me
for offering outstanding advice.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.548
You know, I-I-- Still, I would
like to make it up to you.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.841
How 'bout we grab that breakfast now?

09:51.841 --> 09:53.342
- My treat.
- It's 5:00.

09:53.342 --> 09:56.554
Hm, true. European lunch?
Old folks dinner?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.264
Look, I'm dealing with
a pretty big crisis at work

09:58.264 --> 09:59.932
and I need to dive back in
first thing tomorrow,

09:59.932 --> 10:01.726
- so if you could--
- Oh, my god! Way to bury the lede.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.103
I excel in a crisis. How 'bout this?

10:04.103 --> 10:05.229
We can grab a light snack,

10:05.229 --> 10:06.564
I will solve your work problem for you,

10:06.564 --> 10:08.941
and, uh, then we'll, uh, call it a day?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.364
What about... a bus?

10:15.364 --> 10:16.866
Have you considered a bus? It could work.

10:16.866 --> 10:20.036
It's... 30 hours each way.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.247
Okay, I can see how
that could be... difficult.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.583
So far, this has been very helpful.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.584
Here's a thought.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.461
Have you considered that maybe

10:28.461 --> 10:29.754
your bosses are using this

10:29.754 --> 10:31.922
as a made-up assignment to mess with you?

10:33.507 --> 10:35.509
Welcome to investment banking.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.929
Are there good things about your job?

10:43.392 --> 10:45.061
Well, the money doesn't hurt.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.980
Sounds a little superficial.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.276
It's not just the money.
I like the challenge.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.694
Hm.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.112
Ya don't eat, ya don't kill.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.073
It's the other way around.

10:58.115 --> 11:01.327
You know... you don't seem, like,

11:01.327 --> 11:04.872
incredibly... killer-ish to me.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.667
And how would you know what I'm like?

11:07.917 --> 11:12.755
Well, you know, you did... cry when--

11:13.047 --> 11:15.299
- Okay, yeah, no. I'm gonna go.
- Wait, wait. Miguel, wait.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.676
- Why did you cry?
- I don't know.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.843
Okay, perhaps,

11:17.843 --> 11:19.178
we could figure it out together.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.805
You know, have, like,
a brainstorming session.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.682
- I mean, if that would be helpful for you.
- Okay. Thank you

11:22.682 --> 11:24.308
- for the street nuts.
- Wait. Miguel!

11:24.308 --> 11:25.267
I have to go!

11:25.267 --> 11:26.977
Wait, no! But wait!

11:28.813 --> 11:31.148
Miguel, wait! You, you forgot your bag!

11:38.489 --> 11:42.493
- What?!
- I saw a bee on it and I panicked!

11:43.035 --> 11:44.453
How am I supposed to get it back?!

11:44.453 --> 11:47.331
Well, here, here, here, here.
Throw, throw mine.

11:47.331 --> 11:48.541
It's the least I can do.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.711
No, the least you can do
is to not throw my bag over!

11:52.128 --> 11:55.005
Well, the past is the past.
This is the least I can do now.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.383
I don't--

11:58.884 --> 12:00.428
You know, I used to be just like you.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.346
I was so afraid of breaking the rules.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.056
See, my dad is a coroner,

12:04.056 --> 12:05.391
and I spent my entire

12:05.391 --> 12:06.976
childhood hearing about
all the different ways

12:06.976 --> 12:09.228
I was gonna die or be permanently maimed.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.147
And then one day, I just realized,

12:11.147 --> 12:13.149
you cannot live like that.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.569
So, don't overthink it.
Don't even regular think it.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.653
Just.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.327
That was

12:26.495 --> 12:28.706
- oddly satisfying.
-  Right?

12:31.959 --> 12:34.962
I can't believe you did that.
My entire life is in that bag.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.591
What do we do now?

12:40.551 --> 12:42.052
Gimme a boost.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.972
Okay, well, what does,
what does that mean?

12:44.972 --> 12:47.266
- You push me up.
- Like, by the butt?

12:48.267 --> 12:50.394
You didn't do a lot of outdoor
playing as a child, did you?

12:50.394 --> 12:52.980
- Okay, I don't need the insults.
- Ready?

12:52.980 --> 12:54.607
- Yeah.
- One, two, three.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.984
Ooh, it's harder to get up--

12:56.984 --> 12:58.486
- Right there.
- You gotta--

12:58.486 --> 13:00.696
- If I can get the first leg up--
Yeah.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.782
then I can just--
Okay.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.867
- Yeah.
- If I can get this one--

13:07.578 --> 13:09.163
Maybe we should use the gate.

13:09.163 --> 13:12.041
Yeah, that works, too. All right.
- Okay. I'm comin' down.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.463
What is this thing?

13:18.339 --> 13:21.509
There used to be boulders
like this all over the city.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.427
From the last ice age.

13:24.470 --> 13:28.516
Most of 'em are gone, um,
bulldozed to put up high rises.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.600
But,

13:30.684 --> 13:31.727
I don't know.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.522
I always liked this one.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.066
No idea why.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.652
Because it is

13:40.361 --> 13:44.490
- truly... truly hideous.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.330
Hey.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.375
I really am sorry.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.379
About the diner...
And also, about earlier.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.506
It's... it's none of my business

14:00.506 --> 14:05.845
why you cried during...
hand stuff three weeks ago.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.223
I think I maybe do know why.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.267
Well, you don't,
you don't have to tell me.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.228
- Seriously.
- I guess I've just lost so much

14:14.228 --> 14:15.437
in my life.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.149
Things and people.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.528
And whenever life seems good, that's,

14:24.071 --> 14:26.198
that's always right before it goes bad.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.159
Like, as soon as you take that

14:29.159 --> 14:30.703
first bite of birthday cake,

14:30.703 --> 14:34.415
it's just... on its way to being gone.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.793
And that night with you, I,

14:41.213 --> 14:42.673
I felt good,

14:44.008 --> 14:46.677
the best I felt in a long time.

14:48.345 --> 14:51.974
Think I realized just...
how bad it would hurt

14:54.768 --> 14:55.978
when it went away again.

I'm sorry... I should've--

17:50.736 --> 17:53.572
Are you, like... hungry or something?

17:53.572 --> 17:57.284
- Mm. I'm starving.
- Mmm. Okay.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.536
I'll see what I have.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.751
Let's see. Uh. Oh!

18:05.959 --> 18:09.296
I have, um... expired cookie dough?

18:09.588 --> 18:11.006
- Yum.
- Okay.

18:11.006 --> 18:15.511
Let's see. Turn the... oven on here.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.138
Fifteen minutes to preheat.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.396
Maybe you were right.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.065
'Bout what?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.442
When we ran into each other today.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.319
I don't know if it was actually a sign,

18:32.694 --> 18:35.197
but whatever it was,

18:35.656 --> 18:37.199
I'm pretty glad it happened.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.542
Well,

18:47.668 --> 18:48.669
it's--

18:49.628 --> 18:52.965
it wasn't, um... exactly a sign

18:52.965 --> 18:57.344
just 'cause I, I was

18:57.344 --> 19:01.223
waiting outside your office
because I wanted to see you.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.016
But don't, don't, don't be mad, okay?

19:05.060 --> 19:06.854
I'm less mad and more flattered.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.981
Yeah.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.734
Because, the thing is,

19:13.193 --> 19:15.195
I'm, uh, I'm actually

19:16.613 --> 19:19.074
- I'm writing a novel.
- Oh.

19:19.074 --> 19:23.370
Yeah, and I have a... character in it

19:23.996 --> 19:26.415
- named Mitchell, who's sort of
- Hm.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.376
very casually

19:30.294 --> 19:31.712
based on you.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.007
He's a banker

19:35.007 --> 19:39.970
who mysteriously cries during a hand-job.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.767
This is... getting less flattering.

19:45.976 --> 19:49.521
No, see, because my teacher,

19:49.521 --> 19:51.899
she loves this character a lot.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.109
And she, she just-- she wants to know

19:54.109 --> 19:55.736
everything about him.

19:55.736 --> 20:01.325
She really, really wanted
to know why he cried,

20:01.325 --> 20:04.453
which I'm like, "Who cares?"
You know? But.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.621
Uh.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.124
So, that's why you wanted to see me today?

20:09.625 --> 20:13.086
You were just using me to get
juicy material for your novel?

20:13.086 --> 20:14.171
Well, well--

20:14.421 --> 20:17.132
- Initially, yeah, but--
- Oh, okay. I see.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.634
But I'm the superficial one.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.260
- Wait, Miguel.
- Yeah. No, I, I--

20:20.469 --> 20:21.970
Just hang on.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.430
- Miguel, just listen to me.
- What I told you today,

20:23.430 --> 20:24.681
I've never told anyone.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.226
I'm a writer. Every writer does this.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.311
I mean, you know, nobody thinks that

20:29.311 --> 20:32.397
Hemingway is a jerk
for writing about his real life.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.483
Everyone thinks that!

20:35.275 --> 20:37.569
And this isn't your life, this is my life!

20:37.778 --> 20:41.031
Look, I know that I started
our day under false pretenses,

20:41.031 --> 20:42.574
and I really am sorry,

20:42.574 --> 20:44.660
but... everything that's
happened since then,

20:44.660 --> 20:46.245
it's been real.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.623
- And that, I really do think is a sign.
- No!

20:49.623 --> 20:52.084
No, it's not! And you know how I know?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.836
Because there's no such thing as signs.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.463
What is that smell?!

21:01.885 --> 21:03.345
What is that?

21:03.720 --> 21:05.722
When's the last time
you cleaned it?

21:06.056 --> 21:08.058
I've never even used it.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.961
- What?! What?! What?! What?!

21:36.128 --> 21:39.381
- It's, it's, um, it's, it's, it's rats.

21:39.381 --> 21:43.427
It's, um, a family of rats, um,

21:44.177 --> 21:45.429
burning to death?

21:46.471 --> 21:48.890
- I think I made eye contact.
- Oh my god! What do you mean?!

21:49.308 --> 21:50.392
What do you mean, "What do you mean?"

21:50.392 --> 21:51.852
I can't be any clearer than that!

21:51.852 --> 21:54.187
Oh my god! Okay. Oh my god!
Do I, do I turn it off?

21:54.187 --> 21:57.357
Or would that just make them suffer more?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.234
Oh my god, do I turn it up?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.194
- Why are you asking me?!
- 'Cause you saw them!

22:01.194 --> 22:02.487
I mean, did, did it seem like

22:02.487 --> 22:04.031
there was a chance
that they could survive?

22:04.031 --> 22:05.907
Or is it too late?
And, and the humane thing to do

22:05.907 --> 22:07.909
would just be to speed the process up?!

22:07.909 --> 22:10.704
I saw a family of 10 rats! On fire!

22:10.704 --> 22:13.332
- That's as specific as I can be!
- Stop saying that they were a family!

22:13.332 --> 22:15.167
You don't know that! Maybe they just met!

22:15.167 --> 22:16.877
They were all holding each other like,

22:17.294 --> 22:19.421
- like the old couple in <i>Titanic!</i>
- Oh god!

22:30.849 --> 22:34.519
Yeah, I'm gonna backtrack just a smidge.

22:36.605 --> 22:41.026
Since the dawn of time...
there's been exactly one sign.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.404
And this was it.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.491
- I'm gonna go.
-  Please wait.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.452
But the good news is, this whole thing,

22:50.452 --> 22:53.372
I'm sure this will make
a great chapter for your novel.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.664
Miguel!

23:03.340 --> 23:05.092
He is out of his mind.

23:05.092 --> 23:08.720
"Ten rats dead by your own hand"

23:08.720 --> 23:11.181
is so much more than a sign.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.892
How do we feel about "portent?"

23:14.518 --> 23:17.145
Shall we take "portent" out for a spin?

23:22.776 --> 23:24.111
Oh, oh.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.780
I was hoping I could sneak a quick read

23:26.780 --> 23:28.615
before turning the pages over to Gil.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.659
I, I don't have the chapter.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.870
Oh... If you need an extension?

23:33.870 --> 23:36.164
It's not that, um.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.167
I've decided to put the novel down.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.129
I, I realized that
what happened with Mitchell,

23:42.129 --> 23:44.423
it's... not my story to tell.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.425
What about the rest of the book?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.343
Mitchell's just one character.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.513
But you said Mitchell was all you were

23:51.513 --> 23:52.889
interested in, I mean--

23:52.889 --> 23:56.351
I was interested because
the author was interested.

23:56.977 --> 24:00.230
It's the same way I feel
when I read any great writer.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.691
I can tell where the passion is.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.902
- You think I'm a great writer?
- Absolutely.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.947
You just need to decide
what story you want to tell.

24:16.455 --> 24:20.625
<i>♪ What if I let somebody see me ♪</i>

24:21.168 --> 24:25.464
<i>♪ If they saw what it is to be me ♪</i>

24:25.964 --> 24:29.217
<i>♪ Would they be terrified ♪</i>

24:29.217 --> 24:32.971
<i>♪ Of the siiight ♪</i>

24:35.599 --> 24:37.517
Returning to the scene of the crime

24:37.517 --> 24:40.520
is a move for <i>successful</i>
criminals, Lindsay.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.815
You got what you wanted, sweetheart.

24:44.024 --> 24:48.570
Your teacher admitted you were
a decently proficient writer.

24:48.570 --> 24:52.199
"Great," Mom. She said I was great.

24:52.532 --> 24:53.992
What are you doing here?

24:55.160 --> 24:57.037
I don't know. I guess I just...

24:57.454 --> 24:58.830
thought if I came back here,

24:58.830 --> 25:01.333
maybe there'd be some kind of a s--

25:01.333 --> 25:05.629
- Don't even say it.
- Fine. I... am done with signs.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.341
- Ah, you said the word.
Well.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.143
Starting tomorrow.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.230
Thank you.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.694
I see you finally

25:29.694 --> 25:31.071
came around on signs.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.158
It's not a sign.

25:35.534 --> 25:39.287
It's a 12-Color photorealistic
life-size cardboard standee.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.918
Well, I... saw your

25:44.918 --> 25:49.881
12-Color life-size
photorealistic cardboard standee

25:49.881 --> 25:53.969
through the window and I took it as a s--

25:55.262 --> 25:58.390
12-color photorealistic life-

25:58.390 --> 26:00.976
- sssize cardboard standee--
- Life-size cardboard standee.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.478
from... the universe

26:04.229 --> 26:06.565
telling me that I should come in here

26:06.565 --> 26:08.900
and say the following to you:

26:10.610 --> 26:11.778
I'm sorry.

26:13.905 --> 26:14.906
Again.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.577
If it makes you feel any better,

26:19.244 --> 26:22.455
I decided to stop... writing the novel.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.836
Why'd you do that?

26:29.129 --> 26:31.006
I need to find my own story.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.551
I did figure out why my...

26:34.801 --> 26:37.178
teacher liked Mitchell so much, though.

26:37.846 --> 26:38.847
Yeah?

26:39.764 --> 26:43.435
She cared about him
because I care about him,

26:44.686 --> 26:48.523
because I... wanted to spend time with him

26:48.523 --> 26:52.611
and figure out why he knew
so many random facts about

26:53.194 --> 26:55.447
rocks and bridges.

26:57.699 --> 27:03.204
Because I... felt something for Mitchell.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.958
I <i>feel</i> something... for him.

27:14.841 --> 27:15.842
Well,

27:18.303 --> 27:23.058
bridges and rocks are really
just scratching the surface of

27:23.058 --> 27:24.768
useless facts that

27:25.727 --> 27:28.146
Mitchell... knows.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.861
There's roadways.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.407
And there's aqueducts.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.956
- He hasn't even broached easements.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.676
Did you ever put us on that waitlist?

27:57.926 --> 27:59.219
You mean...

27:59.719 --> 28:03.390
the waitlist to have sex in the
bathroom at that awful bar?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.183
Mm-hm.

28:13.817 --> 28:17.278
Oh, that's, um...
that's Ski-Slopes Miguel.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.614
That's so I can be
at Chad's bachelor party and--

28:19.614 --> 28:21.658
Right. No, I, I, I got there on my own.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.952
Could you-- Maybe you could, um,

28:24.577 --> 28:26.663
- just turn him?
- Yeah, yeah. No, sure.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.707
Thanks.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.125
That's, um--

28:32.669 --> 28:36.589
That's, um... that's Strip-Clubs Miguel.

28:36.589 --> 28:38.425
Strip-Clubs, plural.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.510
- You know, it's a big week for him.
- Okay.
