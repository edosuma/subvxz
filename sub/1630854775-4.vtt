01:38.248 --> 01:39.670
"Staplehead."

01:39.770 --> 01:41.753
Your hit.
That was your hit, yeah?

01:41.853 --> 01:43.314
This was it.

01:43.414 --> 01:44.916
Fucking turn it up!

01:45.016 --> 01:46.238
You don't have to, alright.

01:46.338 --> 01:47.319
Doxxxology.

01:47.419 --> 01:48.881
Fuck yeah!

01:48.981 --> 01:50.482
I had this on CD.

01:50.582 --> 01:52.124
Back in the day.

01:52.224 --> 01:53.966
My daughter tells me
I'm too old to rock,

01:54.065 --> 01:55.768
but I say bullshit.

01:55.868 --> 01:58.532
I work with Ruby Ruin!

01:58.631 --> 02:00.634
Respect you, lady.

02:02.276 --> 02:04.137
Hey, Victor. Hey.

02:04.238 --> 02:05.940
Tour time again.

02:06.039 --> 02:08.022
You interested
in some roadie work
for a few weeks?

02:08.122 --> 02:09.384
Man the merch table?

02:09.483 --> 02:11.185
No. Sorry.

02:11.286 --> 02:12.707
Ruby, you have a visitor

02:12.808 --> 02:14.810
in the break room.

02:23.139 --> 02:25.242
Hey. Uh, drummer, right?

02:25.341 --> 02:26.603
Thanks for answering
the ad.

02:26.702 --> 02:27.765
I'm Ruby.

02:27.865 --> 02:29.447
Yes, you are.

02:29.547 --> 02:31.368
Wow.

02:31.469 --> 02:33.732
This is ama--
I'm Gavin.

02:33.832 --> 02:35.534
Wow. Nice to meet you.

02:35.634 --> 02:37.615
This is fucking amazing,
dude, I'm...

02:37.716 --> 02:38.978
Okay.

02:39.077 --> 02:40.459
I've just been
a diehard Doxxx fan

02:40.559 --> 02:41.661
since I was, like,
two years old.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.423
Dude, this is
fuckin' badass.

02:43.523 --> 02:44.904
My mom said
she'd catch me banging

02:45.004 --> 02:46.146
my sippy cup to "Staplehead."

02:46.245 --> 02:47.226
Just aaah!

02:47.327 --> 02:48.668
Wow. That's--

02:48.769 --> 02:50.310
When I saw the listing

02:50.410 --> 02:52.993
to be the drummer
of Doxxxology

02:53.093 --> 02:54.836
on fucking Craigslist,

02:54.935 --> 02:58.640
I was just, just what,
dude, fucking...

02:58.740 --> 03:00.922
Alright, we leave Monday,
a three-week tour,

03:01.022 --> 03:03.245
mostly bars
and small venues,

03:03.344 --> 03:05.007
but it'll give us time
to tighten up the act,

03:05.106 --> 03:06.728
maybe write
a few new songs,

03:06.829 --> 03:08.051
'cause we end
the tour in Milwaukee,

03:08.151 --> 03:10.012
at the Lariat,
opening for Krampus.

03:10.113 --> 03:11.654
Holy shit, you're opening
for Krampus.

03:11.755 --> 03:13.297
Yo, that's,
that's badass, man.

03:13.397 --> 03:15.418
Yeah, it's a big deal.
But hey...

03:15.519 --> 03:16.861
if you guys are looking
to freshen up

03:16.961 --> 03:18.462
your material at all,

03:18.562 --> 03:20.904
I do a little bit of, like,
writing of my own stuff--

03:21.005 --> 03:22.427
And you got
your own gear?

03:22.527 --> 03:25.070
Yeah, I've got a TAMA kit
with a double bass pedal

03:25.170 --> 03:26.752
and a vintage amp,
so everything you need.

03:26.851 --> 03:28.033
Great. But wait, no,

03:28.132 --> 03:30.076
what the fuck
do you need an amp for?

03:30.176 --> 03:32.719
I blow my backing vocals
through my fuzz pedal,

03:32.819 --> 03:34.000
and it gives it like this,

03:34.100 --> 03:36.803
this crunchy,
chewy, disgusting...

03:36.903 --> 03:39.406
Good. Fine.

03:39.506 --> 03:41.849
Fine. You're in.

03:41.949 --> 03:43.411
I'm in?
You're in.

03:43.511 --> 03:45.373
Holy shit, dude.

03:45.473 --> 03:47.415
Look at me now,
motherfuckers!

03:47.515 --> 03:49.137
This is gonna rock
so fucking hard.

03:49.237 --> 03:50.699
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.620
I will not let you down,
I promise you.

03:52.721 --> 03:56.105
Alright, RV leaves Monday.
I'll send you the deets.

03:56.204 --> 03:58.628
Gavin, we're all
in our 40s.

03:58.728 --> 04:00.029

04:00.130 --> 04:02.552

04:41.937 --> 04:43.799
Not good.

04:43.899 --> 04:45.201

I just slug out
whatever's in my head,

04:46.622 --> 04:47.764
we can zhuzh it up later.

04:47.864 --> 04:49.846
There's no zhuzhing.
It's a turd.

04:49.946 --> 04:51.768
I don't want to zhuzh
the turd.

04:51.868 --> 04:53.290
We have three weeks, man.

04:53.390 --> 04:54.551
We got to come up
with something that's going

Krampus show.

04:56.193 --> 04:57.575
What's the point?

04:57.675 --> 04:59.657
They're just gonna want
to hear "Staplehead."

04:59.757 --> 05:01.259
The point, Eskie,
is that I'm not ready

05:01.359 --> 05:04.623
to lay down and die
as some fucking nostalgia act.

05:04.723 --> 05:06.185
Are you?

05:06.285 --> 05:08.147
I just moved back in
with my mom,

05:08.247 --> 05:10.830
and I got my AARP
membership this year.

05:10.930 --> 05:12.552
So it's been
a banner year for me.

05:12.652 --> 05:14.674
And Al with his divorce.

05:14.774 --> 05:16.597
It's not going well.

05:16.697 --> 05:18.879
And you think
law school is gonna--
Law school?

05:18.979 --> 05:21.562
You think I can afford
law school?

05:21.662 --> 05:23.364
It's an online MSL degree.

05:23.464 --> 05:25.527
I can't even afford
to sell out.

05:25.627 --> 05:27.289
It's desperate times, Rube.

05:27.389 --> 05:29.772
Piling in this shitty van
year after year

05:29.872 --> 05:31.293
for the rest of our lives,

05:31.393 --> 05:34.137
driving around
playing Irish pubs.

05:34.237 --> 05:35.979
I swear to Christ,
I'm gonna start crying

05:36.079 --> 05:37.300
I really think about it.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.902
The goal is not this.

05:39.002 --> 05:41.545
The goal is to get back.

05:41.645 --> 05:45.590
To have shit acts
like Krampus opening for us.

05:45.690 --> 05:48.152
That feeling on stage,
the crowd,

05:48.252 --> 05:50.115
do you remember that?

05:50.215 --> 05:52.878
We're metal gods.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.480
What would you do
to get that back?

05:54.580 --> 05:55.521
Anything.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.243
Anything.
Anything.

05:57.343 --> 05:59.005
We need to do this.

05:59.105 --> 06:00.567
And all we need,

06:00.667 --> 06:02.889
all we need is to write
one new song

06:02.989 --> 06:04.991
that doesn't suck.

06:06.753 --> 06:09.056
I had a kind of a doomy
sort of riff in A,

06:09.156 --> 06:10.298
try this.

06:16.765 --> 06:18.767
That's not bad.

06:32.182 --> 06:33.804
Geez, where'd you get
this kid?

06:33.904 --> 06:35.046
Juilliard.

06:35.146 --> 06:36.207

06:59.053 --> 07:01.476

goes right here.

07:01.576 --> 07:02.877
Okay.
Not here.

07:02.977 --> 07:04.399
Mm-hmm.
And not here.

07:04.499 --> 07:06.081
Okay.
So I, so I don't hunch.

07:06.181 --> 07:07.443
Alright.
I got a sciatica.

Hey, kid,
what do you think?

08:07.691 --> 08:09.633
Why don't you guys just
try to write another song

08:09.733 --> 08:12.156
like "Staplehead"?

08:12.256 --> 08:17.202
I mean, "Staplehead."
That song is, um, good.

08:17.302 --> 08:21.447
So just try and, you know...

08:21.547 --> 08:23.729
make another song
like that.

08:23.829 --> 08:25.892
Why don't I just fucking
traipse into the fucking forest

08:25.992 --> 08:28.495
and capture
a bejeweled fucking Pegasus?

08:28.595 --> 08:30.697
That would be rad too.

08:30.797 --> 08:32.738
Every second of every day,

08:32.838 --> 08:36.103
I try and write a song
like "Staplehead."

08:36.203 --> 08:38.705
I remember the first time
I heard it,

08:38.805 --> 08:41.709
that feeling was like
a needle made of ice

08:41.810 --> 08:43.391
going into my brain.

08:43.492 --> 08:45.753
Like seeing the face of God

08:45.853 --> 08:47.234
and fucking God saying,

08:47.336 --> 08:50.358
"That's what a fucking hit
feels like."

08:50.459 --> 08:52.281
I've been chasing that feeling
for the past 20 years

08:52.382 --> 08:53.402
and never come close.

08:53.502 --> 08:55.484
"Staplehead"'s a fucking curse.

08:55.584 --> 08:57.247
That song ruined my life.

08:57.347 --> 09:00.450
But the song is
your big hit.

09:00.550 --> 09:02.572
We didn't write it.

09:02.673 --> 09:04.815
- What?
- Yeah, we didn't
fuckin' write it.

09:04.915 --> 09:08.060
Our drummer Belinda did,
and she gets all the royalties.

09:08.159 --> 09:10.541
Now that bitch is selling
leggings in the suburbs.

09:10.641 --> 09:12.464
But you guys continue
to play the song.

09:12.564 --> 09:16.188
We have to every gig.
Have to.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.992
And when we're not on stage,
we hear it everywhere.

09:19.091 --> 09:22.234
And we don't get
one red cent.

09:22.336 --> 09:23.276
It's a fucking curse.

09:23.377 --> 09:24.676

10:44.549 --> 10:46.550
I'll break more
than your fucking face.

11:11.859 --> 11:13.202
Hey!

11:13.301 --> 11:15.303
Drummer boy.

11:18.347 --> 11:20.349
Krampus!

11:24.513 --> 11:26.736
Jesus. It's inane.

11:26.837 --> 11:28.418
This will get you popular
these days,

11:28.519 --> 11:30.742
this Jackass shit?

11:30.841 --> 11:32.301
People love it.

11:32.402 --> 11:35.226
Krampus Cam.
They got Ozzy
with that thing once.

11:35.327 --> 11:36.707
Dude, that was fake.

11:36.808 --> 11:38.790
And what are you doing?

11:38.890 --> 11:41.512
Our drummer got hit
in the head

11:41.613 --> 11:44.077
with a stapler
during "Staplehead."

11:44.176 --> 11:46.118
That's what
we call provenance.

11:46.218 --> 11:48.442
Got a secret
little eBay store.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.282
It's not community property.
Don't tell Edward.

11:50.384 --> 11:52.286
Kid's hanging
with us tonight.

11:52.386 --> 11:54.549
Let's party!

11:56.310 --> 11:59.134
I got to be up early,
man, really.

11:59.233 --> 12:01.234
Acid reflux, man.

12:02.236 --> 12:04.240
Sober ten years.

12:06.161 --> 12:08.625
Cool. Cool. Alright.

12:08.724 --> 12:12.069
Hey, kid.
I'm sorry about tagging you.

12:12.168 --> 12:13.550
Don't let that shit
happen again.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.031
But I'm sorry.

12:15.132 --> 12:17.555
Listen, th-that's me
totally out of bounds.

12:17.655 --> 12:21.118
It's, it's your set.
It's your scream. I'm sorry.

12:21.218 --> 12:25.483
And I know that I'm a lot
to put up with, you know,

12:25.584 --> 12:27.445
but I just thank you guys

12:27.545 --> 12:29.928
for puttin' up with me.

12:30.029 --> 12:31.491
I mean, really.

12:31.589 --> 12:33.733
And I know you guys
are looking for a new song,

12:33.832 --> 12:35.655
and, um, I don't want
to overstep or anything,

12:35.753 --> 12:38.819
but I wrote something
and if it sucks, it sucks.

12:38.918 --> 12:41.820
Just let me know.
Just say it, no harm.

12:41.921 --> 12:43.925
But I want you
to hear it.

12:45.325 --> 12:46.788
It's not like we got
anything else.

12:46.887 --> 12:48.888
Tss...

12:50.252 --> 12:52.253
Here we go.

13:38.106 --> 13:40.108
What did you think, Ruby?

13:42.070 --> 13:44.072
Uh...

13:46.396 --> 13:49.819
Yeah, there's some
good stuff there, kid.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.921
Keep working on it.

13:52.402 --> 13:54.344
Seriously? Okay.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.348
And I guess
I will leave you guys

13:58.449 --> 14:00.271
to your own party
or whatever.

14:00.372 --> 14:03.194
Ha, ha, ha!

14:03.295 --> 14:05.296
I'm gonna go to bed.
Good night, guys.

14:09.462 --> 14:11.463
Holy shit.

14:15.228 --> 14:17.231
I'm not crazy, right?

14:20.194 --> 14:22.195
Tell me I'm crazy.

14:22.716 --> 14:24.718
It's a fuckin' hit.

14:27.442 --> 14:29.964
It's gonna be "Staplehead"
all over again.

14:34.409 --> 14:36.413
Doesn't have to be.

14:59.478 --> 15:00.899
So I'm fired.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.862
You're dragging the energy
of the band down.

15:02.963 --> 15:05.745
We're trying to grow wings,
and you're...

15:05.846 --> 15:07.848
You just,
you're not on board.

15:10.531 --> 15:11.832
How'd he take it?

15:11.933 --> 15:13.154
He'll live.

15:13.253 --> 15:14.755
Well, I broke
my sacred commitment

15:14.856 --> 15:16.858
to veganism for this.

15:17.899 --> 15:19.401
I got it, dudes,
thank you.

15:19.501 --> 15:20.642
Hey, kid.

15:20.742 --> 15:23.245
Yo, what's up?
Whoa...

15:23.346 --> 15:25.127
When we play
"Staplehead" tonight...

15:25.228 --> 15:26.969
Mm-hmm.

15:27.069 --> 15:28.611
...I want you
to take my scream.

15:28.712 --> 15:30.012
No, no, no, no, no.

15:30.113 --> 15:31.415
That is not my--

15:31.513 --> 15:32.695
That's yours.
You have earned it.

15:33.997 --> 15:36.000
It's a fuckin' honour, man.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.024

I just need

20:47.754 --> 20:49.255
It was just metal.

Yes, it was very metal.

Ruby? Uh, yeah.

21:01.730 --> 21:03.472
On account of how
she punched you in the face.

21:03.572 --> 21:05.355
But also, who cares?

21:05.455 --> 21:07.996
I mean, don't get me started

21:09.498 --> 21:11.041
I thought
she was cool, man.

21:11.140 --> 21:13.163
I'm starting to suspect
she's actually a real dick.

21:13.263 --> 21:15.646
I know.
Ruby's... she's cool.

21:15.745 --> 21:18.149
She's, she's alright.

21:20.110 --> 21:22.053
Mm, mm...

maybe tomorrow, I can,

what's that thingy?

21:55.471 --> 21:56.733
Oh, well,

21:56.832 --> 21:57.974

21:59.876 --> 22:01.879
That way,

22:57.100 --> 22:59.102

like this forever?

22:59.504 --> 23:02.046
Maybe.

23:02.147 --> 23:04.209
I hadn't really thought
about it that way, I--

23:04.310 --> 23:06.692
Not fully
until just now, actually.

23:06.792 --> 23:11.137
So thanks for that fresh dose
of existential dread.

23:13.438 --> 23:16.023
Oh, no, no. Toss it.

23:16.121 --> 23:17.745
I do not consent
to photos.

23:17.844 --> 23:19.347
Well, it's not like
I post them or anything.

23:19.447 --> 23:21.790
It's just for, like,
a mind-collage of my own.

23:21.889 --> 23:23.890
Oh.

23:24.331 --> 23:26.113
That was littering.

23:26.214 --> 23:28.357
Yes, it was.

23:28.456 --> 23:31.600
Gosh, you are just
really dedicated

23:31.701 --> 23:33.483
to not wearing shoes, huh?

23:33.582 --> 23:36.086
If you're wearing shoes,
you're just not grounded,

23:36.186 --> 23:37.327
you know.

23:37.427 --> 23:38.488
Life is a beat, Chuck.

23:38.589 --> 23:39.770
You got to feel it.

23:39.870 --> 23:43.454
Hey, look. See?

23:43.553 --> 23:46.137
Ba-da-da-whoosh.
Ba-da-da-whoosh.

23:46.236 --> 23:48.540

Ba-da-da-whoosh. Alright.

23:48.639 --> 23:49.581
Look, see?

23:51.443 --> 23:53.264
That's the bridge
we went over.

23:53.365 --> 23:54.907
You know?
Little raindrops.

23:56.408 --> 23:58.952
Holistic magpie motherfucker.

23:59.052 --> 24:02.696
Yeah. Sometimes I just,
I feel this shit so hard.

24:04.457 --> 24:06.459
Carries me through.

24:07.061 --> 24:09.062
Makes the bad stuff just...

24:10.144 --> 24:12.147
roll right off of me.

24:25.921 --> 24:27.342
Hi.

24:27.444 --> 24:29.505
I owe you one for
taking that little shitheel

24:29.606 --> 24:31.609
off our hands for the day.

24:33.571 --> 24:36.274
You know, that kid really
took a hit for you, right?

24:36.373 --> 24:39.398
God, I hope he didn't lose
any precious brain cells.

24:39.497 --> 24:41.560
You might give him
a break.

24:41.659 --> 24:43.081
Is all I'm sayin'.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.964
He's a vibe-killer.

24:45.063 --> 24:46.966
Can't read a room.
It stresses me out.

24:47.065 --> 24:48.687
He's just nervous.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.791
He worships you.

24:52.713 --> 24:54.855
I got to tell you, Ruby,
I really thought

24:54.955 --> 24:58.099
that being on tour with the band
was going to be like,

24:58.198 --> 25:01.022
you know, one big party,
all fun and bonding,

25:01.121 --> 25:02.384
like... Spinal Tap.

high school bullshit.

25:09.772 --> 25:11.774
Consider my eyes opened.

25:19.503 --> 25:21.323
Hey!

25:21.425 --> 25:23.568
Drummer boy.

25:23.668 --> 25:26.610
Dude, I don't know
what kind of voodoo,

25:26.711 --> 25:28.533
whatever you did,

25:28.634 --> 25:30.576
but thank you.

25:30.676 --> 25:32.138
What voodoo did I do?

25:32.236 --> 25:35.861
Well, I saw you talking
to Ruby last night,

25:35.962 --> 25:38.745
and now she's gonna
let me do the scream.

25:38.844 --> 25:40.107
The "Staplehead" scream.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.207
I've been dreaming
doing it since I was

25:41.207 --> 25:42.549
a little dumb-as-fuck baby.

25:42.649 --> 25:44.952
This is, this is
fuckin' everything, man.

25:45.052 --> 25:47.053
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah...

25:48.096 --> 25:49.515
Hey. So, um...

25:49.617 --> 25:51.319
Oh. Uh, uh... You...

25:51.418 --> 25:54.243
I'll, I'll get
a good one for you.

25:54.342 --> 25:57.524
I'm happy for you,
you little scamp.

The ME's ruling your drummer
died by electrocution.

26:52.007 --> 26:53.110
His amp wasn't grounded.

26:53.209 --> 26:54.471
So when he touched
the mic,

26:54.571 --> 26:56.934
it was like
kissing a lightning bolt.

26:57.813 --> 26:59.357
Jesus.

26:59.456 --> 27:02.280
It was an accident
due to faulty equipment.

27:02.379 --> 27:04.202
We're impounding the amp
for insurance purposes,

27:04.302 --> 27:07.284
but you can have the rest
of your equipment back.

27:07.386 --> 27:10.049
You all were
on that stage, too.

27:10.149 --> 27:12.149
It could have been
a lot worse.

27:13.592 --> 27:15.594
Wow.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.039
Guess we just got lucky.

27:26.648 --> 27:28.649
Good idea.

27:35.457 --> 27:37.840
What do you figure I can get
for these on eBay?

27:37.938 --> 27:39.943
Don't you fuckin' dare.

change our lives.

27:47.911 --> 27:49.293
Let's keep it together.

27:49.392 --> 27:50.573
About that.

27:50.675 --> 27:52.617
We should get
a recording of the song,

27:52.716 --> 27:54.019
at least a rough demo,

27:54.119 --> 27:55.981
before we play it
at the Krampus show.

27:56.081 --> 27:58.623
We can use his rhythm track,
but we all play the rest.

27:58.724 --> 28:00.024
Really lock in
our ownership.

28:00.126 --> 28:02.108
Then let's do it
right fuckin' now.

28:02.207 --> 28:04.390
And where are we gonna
find a recording studio

28:04.491 --> 28:07.254

Okay, just look me
in the eyes

31:03.293 --> 31:05.937
and tell me that Gavin
didn't write that song?

31:07.098 --> 31:09.100
Gavin wrote that song.

31:10.061 --> 31:13.084
Oh. Well, that's true.

31:13.185 --> 31:16.128
But also not cool.
He deserves credit.

31:16.226 --> 31:18.051
And what do we deserve?

31:18.149 --> 31:19.572
That song isn't going
to bring Gavin back,

31:19.671 --> 31:21.573
but it'll change
our lives.

31:21.675 --> 31:24.015
We recorded the song.
We're playing it tonight.

31:24.117 --> 31:26.178
Look, Charlie, I'm just trying
to make something good

31:26.280 --> 31:27.541
out of something bad.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.424
Well, right, but,

31:29.524 --> 31:31.906
but if it's Gavin's song,
people should know that.

31:32.005 --> 31:33.187
There are a thousand ifs.

31:33.288 --> 31:34.709
If I hadn't given him
the scream,

31:34.810 --> 31:36.472
if our roadie hadn't quit
and checked the amp,

31:36.572 --> 31:38.474
if I had anything left
in my garbage life

31:38.573 --> 31:40.034
except one last shot.

31:40.136 --> 31:41.878
This shot.

31:41.976 --> 31:43.980
It is what it is,
and I'm taking it.

31:45.581 --> 31:46.923
I'm sorry about the kid,

31:47.023 --> 31:49.024

sit right, Gavin.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.469
Shit.
Whoa!

32:10.570 --> 32:12.871
Ooh!

32:12.973 --> 32:15.156

32:23.425 --> 32:26.007
Nice right hook,
merch girl.

32:26.108 --> 32:27.928
I see you're moving up
in the world, huh?

32:28.030 --> 32:29.972
Is that why you quit?
Quit?

32:30.072 --> 32:31.613
I got canned
on some bullshit.

32:31.714 --> 32:33.817
Huh.

32:33.917 --> 32:36.500
Well, you know, I knew that
Ruby threw a lie in there.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.302
I just couldn't track
the, uh...

32:38.401 --> 32:40.705
This business is built
on relationships.

32:40.803 --> 32:42.427
And amphetamines.

32:42.526 --> 32:45.149
Can I ask you something?
It's, uh, it's about the kid.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.952
The thing that happened
with his amp.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.033
I mean, is that something
that happens?

32:49.134 --> 32:50.916
Yeah, it happens.

32:51.015 --> 32:52.358
Yardbirds, '77.

32:52.457 --> 32:54.198
Lead guitarist bit it
using the same amp.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.923
That's why they have
a death capacitor.

32:57.023 --> 32:58.445
A what?

32:58.544 --> 33:01.849
Old amps used to have cords
with two prongs

33:01.948 --> 33:03.290
instead of three.

33:03.389 --> 33:04.932
If you reverse the plug,

33:05.032 --> 33:07.053
it's like sticking
a fork in a socket.

33:07.154 --> 33:09.417
A death capacitor
keeps it safe.

33:09.515 --> 33:13.380
- So Gavin didn't know that?
- Of course, he did.

33:13.482 --> 33:15.582
He had his amp converted
to three-prong.

33:15.684 --> 33:18.668
It was safe. I wouldn't have
let him use it if it wasn't.

33:18.767 --> 33:20.889
Here, let me show you
what it looks like.

33:22.371 --> 33:26.076
Okay, here's one on eBay. Identical.

33:26.176 --> 33:28.177

he's working on

34:56.479 --> 34:58.801
a new song called
"You Can't
Un-murder Someone."

34:59.802 --> 35:00.984
Sounds metal.

35:01.084 --> 35:03.307
It sounds like
a guilty conscience

35:03.407 --> 35:05.950
unburdening itself
for killing a drummer

35:06.050 --> 35:07.631
via power ballad.

35:07.731 --> 35:08.673
What?

35:08.773 --> 35:10.114
That song

35:10.214 --> 35:12.077
is basically
a confession.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.880
Uh, yeah. Okay.
So you wanna arrest Bob Marley

35:14.980 --> 35:16.682
for singing
"I Shot the Sheriff"?

35:16.782 --> 35:18.484
If he was also selling
Gavin's amp on eBay,

35:18.584 --> 35:20.967
like Al is, then yeah.

35:21.067 --> 35:23.970
I know it sounds nuts,
but I think

35:24.070 --> 35:26.653
that Al switched it out
for a booby-trapped amp

35:26.753 --> 35:28.695
and killed Gavin.

35:28.795 --> 35:31.699
Listen. I know
you really liked the kid.

35:31.799 --> 35:34.382
You're traumatised.
We all are.

35:34.482 --> 35:37.545
But reality now,
equipment mix-ups happen.

35:37.645 --> 35:39.788
Deuteronomy wasn't there
to check it.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.671
Convenient, right?
Jesus.

35:42.771 --> 35:45.274
Al was on stage
the whole time Gavin was.

35:45.374 --> 35:47.717
You think he would have risked
electrocuting himself?

35:47.817 --> 35:49.819
Or Eskie or me?

35:51.982 --> 35:54.365
Well that's true. Huh.

35:54.465 --> 35:56.467
Huh?

35:57.348 --> 35:58.730

35:58.830 --> 36:00.772
and this will all be
in your rearview mirror.

36:00.872 --> 36:02.334
Okay?

36:02.434 --> 36:05.097
Chill out
and keep it together.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.199
Yeah?

36:09.442 --> 36:12.185
What are you doing?
You put Gavin's amp on eBay?

36:12.285 --> 36:13.907
It's vintage.

36:14.007 --> 36:17.351
It's evidence. Right?

36:17.451 --> 36:19.393
- I guess.
- You guess?

36:19.493 --> 36:21.756
I haven't taken
Criminal Law yet.

36:21.856 --> 36:24.439

you don't sing it under oath.

36:46.444 --> 36:47.625
Uh, hey, Deuteronomy.

36:47.725 --> 36:49.467
Um, can I borrow
your readers?

36:49.567 --> 36:52.350
You know, I'm trying to see
something on here, and I can't.

36:52.450 --> 36:55.474
No. But how about
the right tool for the job?

36:55.574 --> 36:57.736
Oh, okay. Upgrade.

37:02.582 --> 37:04.124
Huh? Okay.

37:04.224 --> 37:06.807
So Al was being
a real baby

37:06.907 --> 37:08.289
about setting up
his mic stand, right?

37:08.389 --> 37:10.011
Yeah.

37:10.111 --> 37:12.333
Said it was his hunchback
or something.

37:12.433 --> 37:13.735
I tried to teach him
the Pilates

37:13.835 --> 37:15.016
I learned
from Jimmy Page

37:15.116 --> 37:16.458
but no!

37:16.558 --> 37:19.421
Okay. So look at this.

37:19.521 --> 37:21.884
This is from the show
when Gavin died.

37:22.965 --> 37:24.547
Look at the tape.

37:24.647 --> 37:28.752
Somehow in this show,
on this one night,

37:28.852 --> 37:30.754
he got taller.

37:30.854 --> 37:32.596
Huh, I--

37:32.696 --> 37:35.720
Well, so what?
Maybe he wore different shoes?

37:35.820 --> 37:38.723
I mean, why would a guy
with a bad back

37:38.823 --> 37:41.146
suddenly wear
new shoes on stage?

37:42.267 --> 37:44.269
Hmm.

37:44.950 --> 37:47.153
Well, you can't see
his shoes there though.

37:47.994 --> 37:49.375
Oh.

37:49.475 --> 37:50.777
Huh.

38:27.158 --> 38:30.702
Hey. I-I-I come
in peace, I...

38:30.802 --> 38:32.804
Ca-can I borrow that?

38:33.726 --> 38:35.588
Come on, now.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.731
Show me some
heavy-soled murder shoes.

38:41.374 --> 38:43.276
Gotcha, you son of a bitch.

38:45.038 --> 38:47.041
Whoa!

38:50.800 --> 38:52.842
Holy Toledo.

38:59.290 --> 39:01.472
Rest in metal. Seriously?

39:01.572 --> 39:03.354
Jesus. What now?

39:03.454 --> 39:05.477
You guys are sick
with this bullshit tribute.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.358
You killed him.
All of you.

39:07.459 --> 39:08.599
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

39:08.700 --> 39:10.001
Me? Oh, I don't know.

39:10.102 --> 39:11.804
Maybe, maybe
I'm the highest bidder

39:11.904 --> 39:14.006
on eBay
for Gavin's real amp,

39:14.106 --> 39:15.929
you know, the one you
switched out to kill him.

39:16.029 --> 39:18.251
Or maybe I'm the girl
with the photographic proof

39:18.351 --> 39:20.654
that you knew he was
going to be electrocuted.

39:20.753 --> 39:24.018
You're all wearing Docs
with thick rubber soles

39:24.117 --> 39:26.461
to insulate you
from that electro shit

39:26.561 --> 39:27.942
that you sent
through Gavin.

39:28.041 --> 39:30.505
You know, when you told
the fire inspector

39:30.605 --> 39:33.068
that you got "lucky,"
I knew it was a lie,

39:33.168 --> 39:35.030
I just didn't
put it together.

39:35.130 --> 39:37.032
Y'all made your own luck,
didn't you?

39:37.133 --> 39:38.875
You know,
I may not have my degree,

39:38.974 --> 39:41.197
but even I know
that's not legal proof.

39:41.297 --> 39:43.920
Gavin was the real deal,
you know,

39:44.020 --> 39:45.642
and he was a good guy,

39:45.742 --> 39:47.684
and you killed him
just for what?

39:47.785 --> 39:51.309
For some stupid little song
about sucker punching?

39:53.431 --> 39:56.034
It's not just a song.
It's a hit.

39:57.636 --> 39:58.777
You know what, Ruby?

39:58.876 --> 40:00.820
I knew that you were
a has-been.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.061
But it's worse than that.

40:02.161 --> 40:03.943
Alright, you're a hack.

40:04.043 --> 40:06.626
And maybe I won't get to see you
in an orange jumpsuit,

40:06.726 --> 40:09.630
but you'll be in that
orange "Build Box" apron

40:09.730 --> 40:12.853
for the rest of your
sad little hacky life.

40:14.255 --> 40:15.476
Security!

40:15.576 --> 40:17.599
Gavin had talent, okay.
He was metal.

40:17.699 --> 40:19.481
He was real metal.

40:19.581 --> 40:21.762
And you all, you're
the opposite of metal.

40:21.863 --> 40:23.605
Alright? You're talc.

40:23.704 --> 40:25.708
You hear me?
You're fuckin' talc!

40:27.189 --> 40:29.291
She can't do shit.

40:29.392 --> 40:31.414
We play the fuck
out of that song tonight

40:31.514 --> 40:32.616
and everything changes.

40:32.715 --> 40:34.718
Yes?

40:35.078 --> 40:36.380
Let's rock!

40:36.480 --> 40:38.182
Hey, do you mind
swinging past

40:38.282 --> 40:40.104
just over here? Uh...

40:40.204 --> 40:42.387
Thank you. Thanks. I just--
I got to grab my, my bag,

40:42.487 --> 40:45.530
and then I promise to continue
to throw myself out, so...

40:46.732 --> 40:47.913
I better not see you again.

40:48.012 --> 40:49.835
No, absolutely.
I appreciate you.

40:49.934 --> 40:53.159
You're doing good work. Efficient.

40:53.259 --> 40:54.440
Hi. Hey, guys.

40:54.540 --> 40:56.041
Any of you know
my friend Lucy?

40:56.142 --> 40:57.284
You know
Lucy in the Sky--

40:57.384 --> 40:59.126
Man 2:
Fuck off, narc.

40:59.226 --> 41:01.729
Cocaine. Just looking for
some old-fashioned cocaine.

41:01.829 --> 41:03.991
Hey, narc.

41:05.032 --> 41:07.035
My name's Scott.

41:07.836 --> 41:09.657
And that's how Doxxxology

41:09.758 --> 41:11.260
murdered their drummer Gavin,

41:11.360 --> 41:13.362
I don't know his last name,
for a song.

41:17.086 --> 41:19.809
Yeah, uh, well, that's,
uh, that's a, a lot.

41:21.530 --> 41:23.032
Ah.

41:23.133 --> 41:24.954
I got no proof.

41:25.055 --> 41:26.557
It's a whole lot
of nothing.

41:26.657 --> 41:28.719
Just loose, connected dots.
I'm sorry.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.441
I don't know who I thought
would take this seriously.

41:30.541 --> 41:33.064
Y-y-you know what?
I think it's good.

41:34.506 --> 41:35.686
You do?
Yeah.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.369
I think you make
a compelling case.

41:37.469 --> 41:39.211
I mean, some of this
is a stretch,

41:39.311 --> 41:41.713
but you've shored up a lot
of the circumstantial evidence.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.297
I'm convinced.

41:44.396 --> 41:46.720
You think it's enough
to take to your boss?

41:48.322 --> 41:49.863
Why would you want me
to take it

41:49.963 --> 41:52.506
to the VP of Finance
at Nationwide?

41:52.606 --> 41:55.670
Okay, wait.
So you're not a cop?

41:55.770 --> 41:58.333
No, I'm an actuary.
Did you think I was a cop?

42:00.375 --> 42:02.838
Yes, man. Yeah, I thought
you were a narc.

42:02.938 --> 42:04.400
Everyone's been
calling me that.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.322
I think I'm just really bad
at buying drugs.

42:06.422 --> 42:08.765
Yes, you are
really bad at it.

42:08.865 --> 42:10.607
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

42:10.706 --> 42:13.010
everything you just said
makes perfect sense.

42:13.110 --> 42:14.652
Oh, and since
you're already famous,

42:14.751 --> 42:16.414
maybe you can get
some local news attention.

42:16.514 --> 42:18.376
Hmm? What do you mean
I'm famous?

42:18.476 --> 42:20.378
You don't know.
Oh, your video.

42:20.478 --> 42:22.180
It went viral.

42:22.280 --> 42:23.501
Krampus!

42:28.087 --> 42:29.268
When did that go up?

42:29.367 --> 42:31.911
Uh, it says
four hours ago. Why?

42:32.011 --> 42:34.014
Charlie Cale?

42:36.977 --> 42:38.959
Hey, Cliff.

42:39.059 --> 42:40.561
I didn't take you
for a TikToker.

42:40.661 --> 42:42.924
It's over, Charlie.
You're coming with me.

42:43.023 --> 42:45.026
Front seat or the trunk.
Your choice.

42:50.873 --> 42:52.655
Hey. You need
something, brother?

42:52.755 --> 42:56.820
What's up, Milwaukee?!

42:58.280 --> 43:01.585

44:25.260 --> 44:27.081
My friends, in just
three weeks,

44:27.182 --> 44:28.644
you've conquered
the world

44:28.744 --> 44:29.925
To "Sucker Punch."

44:30.025 --> 44:31.407
To Doxxxology. Hey.

44:31.507 --> 44:32.809
A viral smash.

44:34.831 --> 44:36.613
We got to get caviar
in the rider.

44:36.713 --> 44:38.055
I want this
on the tour bus.

44:38.155 --> 44:39.857
Like, I can get used
to this.

44:39.956 --> 44:41.858
This is my new style.

44:43.561 --> 44:45.103
But I can keep
this pen though, right?

44:45.203 --> 44:46.865
Hold up.

44:46.965 --> 44:48.266
Wait.

44:48.366 --> 44:50.829
No.

44:50.929 --> 44:52.391
What the fuck, man?

44:52.491 --> 44:54.492
We have a big problem.

44:57.336 --> 44:59.199
Yeah. So this
"Sucker Punch" song

44:59.299 --> 45:02.122
came out of nowhere,
and it's everywhere now.

45:02.222 --> 45:05.085
But did it come out
of nowhere? It did not.

45:05.184 --> 45:07.128
Shout out to some of our
older viewers for helping us

45:07.228 --> 45:08.409
connect the dots
on this one.

45:31.415 --> 45:32.997
You ripped off
the theme song to "Benson"

45:33.097 --> 45:34.318
and didn't think
nobody would notice?

45:34.418 --> 45:36.800
- I didn't realise it.
- It's,

45:36.901 --> 45:39.483
it's, it's
a fair use homage.

45:39.584 --> 45:42.848
It's copyright infringement
that was about to become fraud.

45:42.948 --> 45:46.372
And it is the least
of your problems.

45:49.155 --> 45:51.818
Murder Girl:
You may know the heavy
metal band Doxxxology

45:51.918 --> 45:54.421
for their '90s
hit song "Staplehead."

45:54.521 --> 45:58.586
And for their incredible
comeback hit "Sucker Punch."

45:58.686 --> 46:01.910
Their story sounds like
a rock-and-roll fantasy.

46:02.010 --> 46:05.914
A band of has-beens who get
their second shot at fame.

46:06.014 --> 46:10.800
But what if I told you
that's not the whole story?

46:10.900 --> 46:14.003
Would you kill
for a second shot at fame?

46:14.104 --> 46:19.128
Commit murder
for one hit song.

46:19.229 --> 46:23.454

46:23.554 --> 46:25.557
