WEBVTT

00:04.475 --> 00:09.727
Now then, you walk towards me,
swearing your loyalty to
your lord and chieftain.

00:11.437 --> 00:13.188
Halt.

00:13.271 --> 00:16.232
Now you present to me
the ancient
standard of the MacDonalds,

00:16.315 --> 00:19.733
carried in battles from
Prestonpans to El Alamein.

00:19.816 --> 00:23.277
Then you say the sacred words
handed down from history.

00:23.361 --> 00:26.029
-Hello, Dad.
-Give me that.

00:26.112 --> 00:29.448
It seems to me, Archie, you're
not treating this ceremony
with the proper respect.

00:29.531 --> 00:31.491
-Sorry.
-Quite.

00:31.574 --> 00:36.118
Then I pass the standard
to the lord's attendant,
the lowest member of my house.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.452
Where is Duncan, by the way?

00:45.541 --> 00:48.834
-You must now kiss me.
-I knew there was a catch.

00:52.170 --> 00:55.296
I now proclaim you
chieftain of this proud land

00:55.380 --> 00:57.464
and master of
these men assembled.

00:57.548 --> 00:59.466
No need to be formal,
just call me boss.

00:59.550 --> 01:02.217
I'm still chief,
for two days more.

01:03.301 --> 01:06.887
Then my life's work is done.

01:06.971 --> 01:10.931
-Hello, welcome to...
-Joe, the welcome
committee is here.

01:12.682 --> 01:16.393
Hello, welcome to Scotland,
my name...

01:16.475 --> 01:19.395
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
I kiss this ground.

01:19.478 --> 01:22.728
The prince from over
the water is home at last.

01:24.648 --> 01:28.650
-Mr MacDonald?
-Chief MacDonald to you, son.

01:30.109 --> 01:32.694
I'm here to
reclaim my inheritance.

01:32.777 --> 01:35.153
I'm the real
laird of Glenbogle.

02:13.886 --> 02:18.471
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Glenbogle
retail experience.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.974
Where the milch cow of
the daytripper will graze.

02:23.391 --> 02:24.434
Hmm.

02:24.517 --> 02:26.643
High quality consumer goods.

02:26.727 --> 02:29.811
Granny McCray's
tayberry conserve?

02:29.895 --> 02:35.273
A genuine artefact celebrating
the unique history
and culture of Scotland.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.901
A Nessie Whoopee Cushion?
Made in Hong Kong.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.235
To attract the more
discerning shopper.

02:41.319 --> 02:45.779
"Amuse your friends with this
rib-tickling jimmy wig.
It's hilarious."

02:50.657 --> 02:52.783
You really think
this will work, Archie?

02:52.867 --> 02:55.911
Ah, imagine it,
bus loads of old codgers
let loose in here.

02:55.994 --> 02:58.412
Zimmer frames backed up
all along the driveway.

02:58.496 --> 03:00.705
Well, if this is the future,
I'm glad I'm in the past.

03:00.788 --> 03:03.081
Well, I think you've done
a marvellous job, Archie.

03:03.165 --> 03:05.166
Thank you, Mother.

03:05.249 --> 03:08.376
And it's perfect that you're
opening on the day of
the clan gathering and games.

03:08.460 --> 03:11.003
So, who's going
to do the honours?

03:11.086 --> 03:15.047
That's a good point,
I hadn't thought.
What about you, Father?

03:15.964 --> 03:19.050
Very well. Kilwillie?

03:19.133 --> 03:20.842
What about Katrina?

03:20.926 --> 03:23.344
She got you
the grant for this place.

03:23.427 --> 03:25.678
Katrina? She's back?

03:28.138 --> 03:30.515
Bonnie,
you see what I'm seeing?

03:30.598 --> 03:34.434
Oh,
God, if my ma could see this,
she'd never believe it!

03:35.351 --> 03:37.685
It's incredible.

03:37.769 --> 03:41.063
Come here, son. See that?

03:41.146 --> 03:45.023
It's beautiful, huh?
One of these days,
that's all going to be yours.

03:45.106 --> 03:46.775
Your destiny.

03:46.858 --> 03:49.776
Maybe Angus wants to decide
for himself what to
do with his life, Joe.

03:49.859 --> 03:53.195
-Where are you going now?
-I got to walk in the water.

03:53.278 --> 03:57.239
I got to feel
the good old earth
of Scotland between my toes.

04:05.536 --> 04:11.748
The timber's from the estate.
Golly found an old
Scots pine up on the hill.

04:11.832 --> 04:14.291
Yeah, for centuries it grew
proud on a hill.

04:14.375 --> 04:18.877
Giving shelter to pine
martins and goldcrests.

04:18.961 --> 04:23.380
And what's it reduced to?
A receptacle for jimmy wigs.

04:23.463 --> 04:26.590
-Come on.
-And dust.

04:26.673 --> 04:30.884
Well, I'm sorry if what
I've done here upsets you.

04:30.968 --> 04:33.261
I have to get on, loads to do.

04:35.095 --> 04:37.680
But isn't that
the way of all flesh?

04:50.104 --> 04:54.149
DUNCAN: And in a minute,
Glenbogle, the Big House.

04:54.232 --> 04:56.608
GOLLY: It's probably nothing,
but if you're
planning on bringing

04:56.692 --> 04:59.693
lorries and coaches over,
you might want it checked out.

04:59.776 --> 05:01.361
Looks all right to me.

05:01.445 --> 05:05.363
It was built 140 years ago
for horse-drawn carriages.

05:05.447 --> 05:09.699
And it's the only
way to the house so...
If anything happened to it...

05:09.782 --> 05:12.242
Well, I suppose we'd better
get an engineer
to check it out.

05:12.325 --> 05:14.994
In the meantime,
we'll put up a sign,
keep the heavy stuff off.

05:15.077 --> 05:17.745
(VEHICLE CROSSING BRIDGE)

05:20.706 --> 05:23.916
Ah, our American friends.
I'd better get back.

05:28.169 --> 05:31.421
-Oh, Archie,
something you should know...
-I'll speak to you later.

05:31.504 --> 05:33.130
Hello, welcome to Glenbogle.

05:33.213 --> 05:36.257
I second that. My son, Archie.

05:36.340 --> 05:38.008
-Hi, nice to see you.
-Hi.

05:38.091 --> 05:41.218
-Thank you for inviting
us into your lovely home.
-Hello.

05:41.302 --> 05:44.928
Look at this. Great
sword of the MacDonalds.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.221
-Am I right?
-Huh, that old thing.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.098
Yeah, I think it dates
back from the 17th century.

05:50.182 --> 05:56.811
16th, I think. Forged
by a Bavarian ironmaster
called Gustavus Mecklin,

05:56.895 --> 05:59.979
-if the memory serves.
-Please forgive my husband.

06:00.062 --> 06:02.731
I'm afraid he's always
been a bit of a know-it-all.

06:02.814 --> 06:06.734
I like to do my research,
dear. Be fully prepared.

06:06.817 --> 06:10.819
Anyway, it's great to have
some American MacDonalds here
for the clan gathering.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.071
Wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

06:13.154 --> 06:16.573
And please, this place isn't a
hotel, it's a home. You must
treat it as if it's your own.

06:16.656 --> 06:18.657
JOE: Oh, we will.

06:18.741 --> 06:23.619
-Won't we, Bonnie?
-Thank you.
You're most gracious.

06:23.702 --> 06:28.288
Well, dinner is at
8:00 and Duncan here
will show you to your rooms.

06:31.415 --> 06:33.291
It's just a short climb.

06:33.374 --> 06:37.085
Oxygen tanks to be picked up
at base camp on
the second floor.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.716
-Are you going out?
-Just popping
over to see Katrina.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.719
-Right.
Just be careful, then, eh?
-Okay.

06:52.761 --> 06:56.806
What's that supposed to mean?

06:56.889 --> 07:02.183
I mean that the girl is
fragile. She only just
split up with Fergal.

07:02.266 --> 07:06.228
So it might not be best for
you to go stomping over there
in your size twelves,

07:06.311 --> 07:09.271
offering yourself as
a substitute for him.

07:10.897 --> 07:14.358
Give her some space for
a while. Do you get me?

07:14.441 --> 07:16.943
Okay. Thanks.

07:21.404 --> 07:23.154
Archie MacDonald.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.203
Hi.

07:34.286 --> 07:38.080
-Timing impeccable as usual.
-Sorry?

07:38.163 --> 07:42.374
I didn't realise you
were coming so soon.
I would have cleaned up.

07:42.457 --> 07:44.251
I must look a right state.

07:44.334 --> 07:47.669
No, you look great.
Just great.

07:48.294 --> 07:50.879
Do I? Thanks.

07:53.297 --> 07:55.757
How are you, Katrina?

07:55.841 --> 07:57.758
Oh, you know. Okay.

08:00.343 --> 08:01.970
That's not true.

08:02.761 --> 08:04.388
I feel terrible.

08:06.347 --> 08:11.684
All that business with
Fergal was... It was just
a complete disaster.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.852
Yeah, right.

08:13.935 --> 08:16.311
Still, the house looks nice.

08:19.147 --> 08:20.772
Sorry?

08:20.856 --> 08:23.899
You using
the weather shield stuff?
Golly swears by it.

08:24.483 --> 08:25.859
Archie...

08:25.942 --> 08:28.485
I suppose in this climate,
with all
the wind and the rain,

08:28.569 --> 08:31.654
the outdoor surfaces need
all
the protection they can get.

08:31.738 --> 08:35.239
-Why don't you just shut up?
-Eh?

08:35.322 --> 08:39.491
I thought you might
have come here to talk.
Make human contact.

08:40.743 --> 08:42.534
-Right.
-So?

08:44.287 --> 08:46.329
Well, there is something.

08:48.164 --> 08:49.873
I was wondering...

08:52.498 --> 08:55.751
I was wondering if
you'd like to open the shop.

08:56.918 --> 08:58.712
You what?

08:58.795 --> 09:01.255
You know, cut the tape,
say a few choice words.
You're good at that.

09:01.337 --> 09:05.049
Getting on your feet and
sounding off about something
you know very little about.

09:05.132 --> 09:07.508
(CLEARS THROAT)
That was a joke.

09:09.093 --> 09:11.720
So what do you say?

09:11.803 --> 09:15.847
I say thanks for dropping by.
It's been a real comfort.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.098
A tonic, you might say.

09:18.182 --> 09:22.642
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm just going to stick
my head in a gas oven.

09:26.270 --> 09:27.354
(SIGHS)

09:27.437 --> 09:29.397
That'll be a no, then.

09:31.815 --> 09:33.107
Hector!

09:35.776 --> 09:36.818
Hector?

09:36.902 --> 09:39.236
What is it, Monty?

09:39.320 --> 09:44.614
End of another day, eh?
And darkness
steals across the land.

09:46.240 --> 09:49.284
Oh, there you are.
It's nearly dinner time.

09:50.826 --> 09:54.079
I was thinking
about old Digger.

09:54.162 --> 09:58.915
The look on that old dog's
face when the vet
stuck the needle in.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.458
Hector, that was years ago.

10:01.541 --> 10:03.459
What's the matter?

10:03.542 --> 10:07.711
Why have you been mooning
around like old King Lear
these last few days?

10:07.795 --> 10:11.255
-It's hard to explain.
-Is it now?

10:11.339 --> 10:13.965
Well, let me try, then.

10:14.049 --> 10:17.133
All Archie's hard work
is coming to fruition.

10:17.217 --> 10:22.512
Conversely, your grip on what
you regard as your life's
work is weakening.

10:24.097 --> 10:27.390
You're a monarch
about to be dethroned.

10:27.473 --> 10:32.726
Consequently, you feel old,
useless and redundant.

10:32.810 --> 10:37.646
"What," you ask yourself,
"is the point of carrying on?"
Am I right?

10:37.729 --> 10:39.939
That about sums it up, yes.

10:40.022 --> 10:42.148
I know you're right,
but what am I to do?

10:42.232 --> 10:45.234
Well, look at it this way.
You live in a beautiful place.

10:45.317 --> 10:49.569
You have two lovely children,
one grandchild.

10:49.653 --> 10:52.947
You have good health
and last, but no means least,

10:54.115 --> 10:56.408
a beautiful and loving wife.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.410
So?

11:00.493 --> 11:04.246
Oh, snap out of it,
Hector, for goodness sakes!
There's a dear.

11:04.829 --> 11:06.122
Come on.

11:12.750 --> 11:16.753
Impossible woman!
Ridiculous...

11:16.837 --> 11:19.671
-Well, how did it go?
-How did it go? Oh, famously.

11:19.754 --> 11:22.089
Swimmingly,
expi-ali-dociously!

11:22.172 --> 11:24.716
Archie, this is important.

11:24.799 --> 11:26.592
-Are you and Katrina...?
-Finished.

11:26.676 --> 11:29.844
Not that we ever got started.
I mean, am I
physically grotesque, Lexie?

11:29.927 --> 11:33.722
Am I gross or insensitive?
Boorish, or dull or...

11:33.805 --> 11:37.265
No, you're not, Arch.
Far from it.

11:37.348 --> 11:41.643
I think you and I need to have
a conversation about a
matter of a mutual interest.

11:41.727 --> 11:43.561
Later, after dinner.

11:44.644 --> 11:47.271
I'll be waiting, sunshine.

11:47.354 --> 11:51.691
You know, when I was a kid,
my old ma used to
sit me on her knees

11:51.774 --> 11:57.777
and tell me stories about how
her family were descended from
these big people in Scotland.

11:57.861 --> 12:00.529
-Hector?
-Sorry. Fascinating.

12:00.613 --> 12:02.697
I bet a lot of Americans
have stories like that.

12:02.780 --> 12:06.241
But it wasn't till recently
that I discovered just how big
these people were,

12:06.325 --> 12:07.992
or how close
the connection was.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.410
Joe, what are we
going to do tomorrow?

12:10.493 --> 12:12.119
We have to find something
that young Angus will enjoy.

12:12.202 --> 12:14.038
So I got this Mormon
genealogist to check it out,

12:14.121 --> 12:16.372
and got my lawyers
on the case.

12:16.456 --> 12:20.666
And the results were
really very interesting.

12:20.750 --> 12:24.336
-And what were they?
-Well, Archie...
Can I call you Archie?

12:24.419 --> 12:28.129
-Sure.
-Bottom line is...

12:28.212 --> 12:30.339
the rightful laird
of Glenbogle, the

12:30.422 --> 12:33.257
real commander-in-chief
of the MacDonalds,

12:33.925 --> 12:35.383
is me.

12:39.219 --> 12:44.056
-JOE: Isn't that
just the darndest thing?
-Sure is. The darndest thing.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.849
-Well, well.
-ARCHIE:
Well, this is ridiculous.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.600
Have you got any proof?
Any evidence to
back it up with?

12:49.683 --> 12:51.976
Kinda.

12:52.060 --> 12:56.146
If you don't believe me,
take a look at this.

13:02.358 --> 13:07.569
ARCHIE: This is unbelievable.
JOE:
Hmm, I know what you mean.

13:07.653 --> 13:12.072
It was kind of tough for me
too at first, but now I'm
getting used to the idea.

13:12.155 --> 13:15.783
You have the nerve to
sit at our dining table
and calmly announce

13:15.866 --> 13:18.660
that you're going to take
this family's home away?

13:18.743 --> 13:23.120
Archie, please,
there are certain
obligations of hospitality.

13:23.204 --> 13:25.205
Bonnie,
Joe, you're most welcome,

13:25.288 --> 13:27.831
as long as you don't do
what our
ancestors may have done.

13:27.915 --> 13:31.709
Run Archie
through with a sword
in the middle of the night.

13:34.086 --> 13:35.878
Oh, Angus.

13:35.962 --> 13:40.089
Your mommy sent me up
with your milk and cookies!

13:40.172 --> 13:44.424
So why don't you
come and get it?

13:49.844 --> 13:51.721
-HECTOR: Good night, Joe.
-Night, Hector.

13:51.805 --> 13:54.681
-Good night, Bonnie.
-Good night, Hector.

13:58.517 --> 14:00.685
Why are you being
so nice to them?

14:00.768 --> 14:04.187
Put them off their guard.
Don't let them
see we're worried.

14:04.271 --> 14:06.230
What are we gonna do?
This is serious.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.565
Think hard and
act expeditiously.

14:08.648 --> 14:13.359
Well, that'll make a change.
Why don't you just
leave it to Archie?

14:13.442 --> 14:16.111
-Night, boys.
-Good night.

14:16.194 --> 14:19.029
I need whisky.
This is a three dram problem.

14:19.113 --> 14:21.614
We need help. We need somebody
who knows about
this sort of thing,

14:21.698 --> 14:23.907
with a cool head
and a sharp brain.

14:23.991 --> 14:26.450
-And low animal cunning.
-Exactly.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.785
I know just the man.

14:40.292 --> 14:42.293
BONNIE:
Never been so embarrassed
in my whole life.

14:42.376 --> 14:43.961
Don't know why you
make such a big deal of it.

14:44.044 --> 14:46.170
We had a deal,
which you broke.

14:46.254 --> 14:49.589
We were gonna come here and
check it out, see if it suited
us, all of us, before you...

14:49.672 --> 14:52.591
We did, and it does.
It's perfect.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.967
Just what we need right now.

14:55.050 --> 14:58.595
Joe, I...
Joe, I'm talking to you.
Where are you going?

14:58.678 --> 15:01.388
To say good night
to the son and heir.

15:04.098 --> 15:06.891
-Ah, Lexie, just the girl.
-That's me.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.601
We need coffee and lots of it.
We're gonna be
staying up all night.

15:09.684 --> 15:12.144
Sounds promising.

15:12.227 --> 15:15.396
-Well, I'm ready.
-Ready for what?

15:15.479 --> 15:18.523
Our chat.
We arranged to have a chat...

15:18.607 --> 15:20.733
I have no time for that.
I have to speak to Kilwillie.

15:20.816 --> 15:22.817
Kilwillie?

15:22.901 --> 15:26.861
Yea, lo and verily,
the saviour did leave Galilee
and come unto Glenbogle.

15:26.944 --> 15:29.362
Kilwillie,
am I glad to see you.

15:29.446 --> 15:33.324
Well, as soon as we're
all sitting comfortably,
we'll begin.

15:33.407 --> 15:39.410
The tale of Ranald MacDonald,
chief of the clan
MacDonald of Glenbogle,

15:39.493 --> 15:44.538
who fought bravely by Bonnie
Prince Charlie's side, right
to the very end of the 45.

15:44.622 --> 15:46.248
Noble defeat at Culloden.

15:46.332 --> 15:49.083
He slipped away
after the battle
and hid in a cave here

15:49.167 --> 15:50.959
while the redcoats
ransacked the house.

15:51.043 --> 15:52.585
Later on he took a
boat for the colonies

15:52.668 --> 15:55.128
in Virginia and cut
down forests and grew tobacco.

15:55.212 --> 15:57.588
And promptly picked
another fight
with the English.

15:57.671 --> 16:01.007
He led a regiment of militia
in the War of Independence.

16:01.090 --> 16:07.636
And he was so smart and so
brave that they called him
The Hammer of the English.

16:07.719 --> 16:09.512
-And then what?
-HECTOR: Well, nothing.

16:09.595 --> 16:14.556
-That side of
the family just got lost.
-Until now. It's all in here.

16:14.640 --> 16:19.601
You descend from
Ranald's younger brother,
Donald.

16:19.684 --> 16:25.230
Now, he snatched his elder
brother's lands and titles,
apparently illegally.

16:25.313 --> 16:28.607
Well, this Joe person
is a direct descendant...

16:28.690 --> 16:30.942
...of Ranald himself.

16:31.025 --> 16:35.444
Your
great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-grandfather.

16:38.655 --> 16:42.281
What do you think of that?

16:42.365 --> 16:47.576
One day, Angus, you'll know
just what a great
thing in your life this is.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.543
Now, does everyone understand
the general strategy?

17:00.626 --> 17:04.336
Yes, find out as much as we
can about them, look for
weaknesses in their case.

17:04.419 --> 17:07.797
Which I have to report,
amigos,
looks as robust as the dollar.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.298
At the same time, try
and put them off the place.

17:09.381 --> 17:11.090
That shouldn't
be too difficult.

17:11.174 --> 17:13.175
Emphasise the irritating
problems of living here.

17:13.259 --> 17:16.844
Maybe they should spend
an afternoon with you, Hector.

17:16.926 --> 17:20.262
Or even better, Archie.

17:20.346 --> 17:26.183
How about getting the bog in
their bathroom to back up from
the septic tank?

17:28.893 --> 17:32.937
Meanwhile,
I shall seek the opinion
of Kilwillie's ace lawyer.

17:33.020 --> 17:36.314
Hector, forgive me,
but isn't this all
rather two-faced?

17:36.398 --> 17:39.399
-What's the matter with that?
-We're fighting
for our lives here.

17:39.482 --> 17:42.276
Time, as they would say,
to play hard bowl.

17:42.359 --> 17:45.736
Ball, Hector.
They call it hardball.

17:45.820 --> 17:47.904
Oh, yeah.
Hardball, sorry, yeah.

17:47.987 --> 17:52.866
Right, this session of the war
cabinet is now over. You know
your tasks, go to them.

18:21.008 --> 18:23.926
Have you run out of paint?

18:24.010 --> 18:27.511
My notice to quit the cottage.
One month, I think.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.729
If you're going to move in
here, you need to know
what you're taking on.

18:42.812 --> 18:45.397
Very good of you, Hector.

18:45.481 --> 18:47.857
-Morning.
-Is it?

18:48.816 --> 18:50.025
Who was that?

18:50.108 --> 18:52.943
-Our head man, Mackenzie.
-Ah, what's he like?

18:53.027 --> 18:56.154
Well, he's all right
when he's not on strike.

18:56.987 --> 18:58.322
Or drunk.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.823
Best avoided then,
fearful temper.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.742
-And when he's sober?
-When he's sober?

19:03.825 --> 19:07.952
Well, he's never
completely sober. Sad, really.

19:11.829 --> 19:13.706
I thought if you were going to
be spending more time here,

19:13.790 --> 19:15.624
I should show you
the local shops.

19:15.707 --> 19:19.168
-Great. Is there a mall?
-Oh, the shop's here.

19:19.251 --> 19:20.585
Just the one?

19:20.668 --> 19:23.420
The garage and
the funeral director
are down there.

19:23.504 --> 19:25.630
That's it? You get
everything you need here?

19:25.713 --> 19:29.715
There's a sweet
little supermarket
an hour's drive that way.

19:29.799 --> 19:32.425
Clothes? Make-up? Accessories?

19:32.509 --> 19:34.593
Harrods.12 hours that way.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.596
Sure is in
a parlous state, Hector.

19:38.679 --> 19:41.764
Oh, these
outbuildings are nothing
compared to the house.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.265
Dry rot, wet rot, the roof...

19:44.349 --> 19:45.767
You don't say?

19:45.850 --> 19:48.018
We've had estimates for the
work, of course, but

19:48.102 --> 19:50.103
but never seen so
many noughts in my life.

19:50.186 --> 19:52.479
-How much?
-Oh, ridiculous sum.

19:53.188 --> 19:54.563
Three million.

19:54.647 --> 19:56.898
-Sterling or dollars?
-Well, sterling, of course.

19:56.981 --> 19:59.775
That's okay. Within budget.

19:59.858 --> 20:02.735
When we sold the company,
we were left
pretty comfortable.

20:02.819 --> 20:04.195
Really?

20:04.277 --> 20:07.947
Cashed in to the tune
of 110 million. Dollars.

20:15.118 --> 20:18.537
Duncan, have you got
some kind of dead
animal in this vehicle?

20:18.620 --> 20:23.832
Just my old coat, Molly.
Sorry if it's a bit ripe.

20:23.915 --> 20:27.583
I'm really sorry, Molly,
but I think I'm gonna upchuck.

20:50.973 --> 20:53.224
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

20:53.307 --> 20:55.851
Well, we've tried to
look after it for you.

20:55.934 --> 20:58.978
You're lucky, having
your son beside you here.

20:59.061 --> 21:01.812
Oh, yeah, he's a good boy.
There's no life for
him here, you know.

21:01.895 --> 21:03.480
Terrible hole.

21:03.564 --> 21:07.441
Your crest, huh?
Guess I'll be
needing one of those.

21:07.524 --> 21:11.735
Oh, yeah?
What symbol will you have?
A pair of crossed hamburgers?

21:11.818 --> 21:13.987
You're a funny guy, Hector.

21:14.070 --> 21:17.405
But if you think you're gonna
put me off this wonderful
place, you're wrong.

21:17.488 --> 21:19.740
-This is my life now.
-Uh-huh.

21:22.825 --> 21:26.703
All right, you little toerag.
Judgement day has come.

21:26.785 --> 21:30.955
You come smarming over here
with your helicopters and your
thousand dollar trainers!

21:31.039 --> 21:34.166
You think you're so
much better than us,
don't you?

21:34.248 --> 21:36.167
You give no respect.

21:36.250 --> 21:41.336
Well, let me tell you,
you spoiled little brat,

21:41.420 --> 21:45.756
you are nothing.
You're less than nothing.

21:45.839 --> 21:51.092
You are minus
nothing to the power 10.
Do you get me?

22:03.725 --> 22:07.518
-Angus...
-That's my dad's
stupid name for me!

22:07.602 --> 22:09.895
All my friends call me Ricky.

22:12.313 --> 22:13.606
Listen...

22:13.689 --> 22:16.774
-I didn't mean...
-Me and my brother,

22:16.857 --> 22:20.401
Joe Jr, we used to
play tricks on each other.

22:22.527 --> 22:23.862
Joe Jr?

22:30.699 --> 22:32.867
Is that a Pictish invader?

22:34.326 --> 22:35.952
(GAME BEEPING)

22:38.245 --> 22:39.996
What level are you at?

22:50.753 --> 22:54.672
You're a bit early for fond
farewells. I'm not leaving for
another four weeks.

22:54.755 --> 23:00.300
Look, Katrina, before you go,
there's a few things
I'd like to say to you.

23:00.384 --> 23:05.553
-Are you sure
they're worth listening to?
-I think so.

23:05.637 --> 23:10.598
Why don't you come around for
a drink tonight? I would
really like to see you.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.433
Yeah, all right.

23:20.312 --> 23:23.314
Ah. Well?

23:23.398 --> 23:27.191
Well,
according to your lawyers,
he has a very strong case.

23:28.109 --> 23:30.026
I feared as much.

23:30.110 --> 23:35.822
Exhaustively researched.
And backed up by
a heap of legal opinion.

23:35.905 --> 23:37.864
Can't we
challenge it in court?

23:37.948 --> 23:41.283
Yes, but Kilwillie's
man said it was futile,
we'd probably lose.

23:41.367 --> 23:45.160
And we'd spend
a fortune in the process,
which of course we don't have.

23:45.244 --> 23:50.414
Of course,
you could always try
the chieftain's challenge.

23:52.748 --> 23:55.542
Kilwillie,
you lovely, clever man!

23:56.709 --> 23:58.585
Terribly risky, though.

23:58.669 --> 24:02.421
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

24:02.504 --> 24:05.840
And what on earth is
the chieftain's challenge?

24:05.923 --> 24:09.633
It was a way of
solving leadership disputes
in the good old, bad old days.

24:09.717 --> 24:13.261
Rivals were tested to see
who was the best
man for the job.

24:13.344 --> 24:16.596
Made rather more sense
than plunging
the clan into civil war.

24:16.679 --> 24:19.889
But this is
the 21st century, right?

24:19.973 --> 24:22.266
I have a terrific case in law.

24:22.349 --> 24:24.892
Ah, but you don't
know Scottish law, Joe.

24:24.976 --> 24:28.854
We would fight you to the
death. It'd be a war
of attrition, I'm afraid.

24:28.937 --> 24:31.646
-Might last five years,
maybe10...
-Easily.

24:31.730 --> 24:35.566
And at the end of the day,
the only winners
would be the lawyers.

24:35.649 --> 24:38.151
It always distresses
me when I see good men

24:38.234 --> 24:41.194
contemplate lining
the pockets of
the shyster brigade.

24:41.278 --> 24:43.404
Indeed,
but that's beside the point.

24:43.487 --> 24:48.157
The clan used the procedure
centuries ago to find the best
leader, the man most worthy.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.241
I thought you'd like
that kind of challenge, Joe.

24:50.325 --> 24:52.451
KILWILLIE: If you wish to be
considered a gentleman,
that is.

24:52.534 --> 24:56.786
I'm not a gentleman.
I'm an American.

24:56.870 --> 25:01.081
-But a challenge, right?
-A test of brain,
a test of brawn,

25:01.165 --> 25:03.041
and a test of wisdom.

25:07.001 --> 25:09.961
Okay. I'll do it.

25:12.838 --> 25:14.922
This is so sweet.

25:15.006 --> 25:17.007
My little refuge.

25:17.090 --> 25:19.842
I can see how
you might need it.

25:19.925 --> 25:22.969
You don't really want
to be a laird's wife,
do you, Bonnie?

25:23.053 --> 25:24.803
It's my husband's dream.

25:24.887 --> 25:28.348
Guess I haven't
got it in my heart
to deny it to him.

25:33.267 --> 25:35.518
What's this?

25:35.602 --> 25:40.521
Ooh, it's Jamie.
He died here some years ago.
In the loch.

25:42.230 --> 25:44.857
He was our boy,
our eldest son.

25:44.941 --> 25:46.691
(BONNIE SIGHS)

25:46.775 --> 25:50.444
-What is it?
-We lost a son. Last year.

25:53.446 --> 25:56.406
Our eldest, Joe Jr.

25:56.490 --> 25:59.282
Oh,
well, he kinda lost himself.

26:00.575 --> 26:03.535
He and his father
hadn't spoken in years.

26:05.536 --> 26:08.497
-He died of an overdose.
-Oh, my dear girl.

26:08.580 --> 26:12.624
Joe blames himself. I mean...
That's why he
sold the business.

26:12.707 --> 26:15.626
That's what this is all about,
this obsession, you know,

26:15.709 --> 26:18.127
getting away and making
a fresh start somewhere.

26:18.211 --> 26:22.922
Oh, I understand, I do, I do.
I've longed for
that for myself, but...

26:23.005 --> 26:26.424
Then Archie went
away for years.
It wasn't easy for him.

26:26.508 --> 26:28.926
It's not for Angus. Ricky.

26:30.426 --> 26:32.761
He loved his brother so much.

26:35.721 --> 26:37.097
You stayed.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.434
You can't leave here,
can you, Molly?

26:45.936 --> 26:47.561
Your boy's here.

26:49.021 --> 26:50.689
BONNIE: At peace.

26:56.067 --> 26:57.651
(CLOCK CHIMING)

27:01.861 --> 27:03.029
Psst.

27:12.034 --> 27:15.370
-So?
Tonight's the night, then?
-I'm sorry?

27:16.329 --> 27:18.581
For our wee tete-a-tete?

27:18.664 --> 27:20.999
I can't, Lex,
I've got this revision to do.

27:21.082 --> 27:23.041
If you don't know it now,
you never will, Archie.

27:23.125 --> 27:26.419
Look,
this can't wait any longer.
It's really important.

27:26.502 --> 27:28.336
Archie, come on.

27:28.420 --> 27:31.130
I'll test you on the clan
wars of the 15th century.

27:31.213 --> 27:34.007
Sorry, Lex.
Next week's dinner menu
is just gonna have to wait.

27:34.089 --> 27:37.008
It's not dinner... Arch!

27:45.930 --> 27:47.556
Looks good, huh?

27:48.390 --> 27:49.849
Unbelievable.

27:52.851 --> 27:54.268
-Joe?
-Uh-huh?

27:54.351 --> 27:56.603
When are you gonna
face up to reality?

27:56.686 --> 27:58.563
Never mind a kilt,

27:58.646 --> 28:01.939
what you've been wearing
for the last year is a pair of
oversized blinkers.

28:02.023 --> 28:05.942
-Ever since Joey died.
-I don't wanna
talk about that.

28:06.026 --> 28:08.485
Of course not.
That's my point.

28:08.569 --> 28:11.653
You want to escape
to some fantasy land
somewhere where you imagine

28:11.737 --> 28:17.282
-everything is safe and
cosy and free from pain.
-What are you talking about?

28:17.365 --> 28:21.201
How do you think these good
people feel about being
put out of their home?

28:21.285 --> 28:25.621
Where their children were born
and grew up and, oh,
yeah, where one of them died.

28:25.704 --> 28:30.457
You don't understand.
This place is our future.
It's our destiny.

28:30.540 --> 28:35.585
No, it isn't. It's your weird
obsession. It has nothing
to do with us or our son.

28:35.668 --> 28:38.962
You're wrong! It's him
I'm doing it for, all of it!

28:39.045 --> 28:44.007
Joe, he doesn't want it!
It means nothing to him!
He's miserable here!

28:44.965 --> 28:47.300
-Oh!
-Yes!

28:47.383 --> 28:51.094
You dancer! Well done, mate.
You want a Fruit Gum?

29:04.060 --> 29:06.853
Well, what can we do for you?

29:06.937 --> 29:08.980
Lexie,
I've come to see Archie.

29:09.063 --> 29:11.148
(SCOFFS) You'll be lucky.

29:11.232 --> 29:13.024
He asked me over.

29:14.900 --> 29:17.235
Archie? Asked you?

29:17.860 --> 29:19.486
For a chat.

29:22.363 --> 29:24.364
Don't you think
he's suffered enough?

29:24.447 --> 29:25.740
Sorry?

29:25.823 --> 29:27.908
Have you no idea
what he went through

29:27.991 --> 29:30.159
when you were dabbling with
your dreamboat from Dublin?

29:30.243 --> 29:31.952
But now you've dumped him

29:32.035 --> 29:34.203
and you snap your fingers
and expect Archie
to come running.

29:34.286 --> 29:36.996
I don't know about you
but that sounds like
a pretty good definition

29:37.080 --> 29:38.706
of mental cruelty to me.

29:38.790 --> 29:42.083
-That is not fair.
-Och!
Give me a break, darling!

29:44.501 --> 29:46.294
Hasn't it occurred to you

29:46.378 --> 29:49.087
maybe our mutual friend
looked for a more
reliable partner

29:49.170 --> 29:52.256
while you were leading him
such a not-very-merry dance?

29:52.339 --> 29:56.384
What? Do you mean,
Archie and you...

29:56.467 --> 29:59.593
I'm fond of
a slow smooch myself.

29:59.677 --> 30:03.596
Maybe that's what he wanted to
talk to you about, eh?

30:03.680 --> 30:06.098
Right. Well, I better go.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.307
Good night, Lexie.

30:14.936 --> 30:16.271
(HUMMING)

30:26.151 --> 30:28.278
-Arch, that you?
-Yep.

30:37.783 --> 30:41.286
-Lexie, what are you doing?
I'm...
-Busy, I know.

30:41.369 --> 30:46.621
I've got something
important to tell you
and it can't keep any longer.

30:46.705 --> 30:52.292
Now, you know I fancied you
from the minute I saw you.

30:52.375 --> 30:57.545
And since I've got to
know you as a person,
a man, my feelings have grown.

30:59.296 --> 31:00.714
Have they?

31:02.756 --> 31:09.177
You're caring, you're kind,
you think about other people.

31:09.260 --> 31:13.763
At the same time,
you're strong.
You're special, Arch.

31:17.599 --> 31:21.601
I want to be with you.
Understand me?

31:26.770 --> 31:28.397
What do you say?

31:29.981 --> 31:31.274
Um...

31:34.150 --> 31:35.776
It's difficult.

31:37.694 --> 31:39.320
I don't know what to say.

31:39.403 --> 31:42.363
Well, work it out quick.

31:44.364 --> 31:49.910
Lexie, you're...
You're funny...

31:49.993 --> 31:55.413
you're clever, you're
beautiful, you're wise,
you're very, very sweet.

31:56.872 --> 31:58.040
But?

32:00.166 --> 32:02.250
Katrina got to me first.

32:06.836 --> 32:08.129
I see.

32:09.087 --> 32:11.464
I'm sorry, Lex. I really am.

32:14.466 --> 32:19.886
It's all right. I'd
already guessed it anyway.

32:19.969 --> 32:23.347
Archie... Oh, morning, Lexie.
Your father's
anxious to leave.

32:23.430 --> 32:28.475
Come on, my boy. I've got
the keys, I've got the sword.
Now, I need my champion.

34:17.915 --> 34:19.750
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

34:24.585 --> 34:30.047
With the power vested in me
as chief of
the clan MacDonald,

34:30.130 --> 34:34.341
I declare this 147th gathering
and games in session.

34:35.801 --> 34:40.596
For those in combat today,
may your eye be keen,

34:41.721 --> 34:44.097
and your arm be strong.

34:47.183 --> 34:50.351
-The clan MacDonald!
-ALL: Clan MacDonald!

35:01.483 --> 35:02.984
You come to watch me win?

35:03.068 --> 35:06.778
Make a fool of yourself,
you mean?
How could I stay away?

35:10.113 --> 35:12.615
Well, time to begin.

35:13.616 --> 35:15.075
-Best of luck.
-Thank you.

35:15.158 --> 35:17.576
Good luck, my boy.
Your ancestors will
be with you in spirit.

35:17.659 --> 35:19.827
Very comforting.

35:19.911 --> 35:23.288
Break a leg, darling.
But not really.

35:42.299 --> 35:47.344
The first part
of the challenge
tests the rivals' skill

35:47.427 --> 35:52.639
at one of
the clan's most important
and most venerated rituals.

35:52.722 --> 35:55.224
Stealing his
neighbour's livestock!

35:56.391 --> 35:58.058
To your stations!

36:03.437 --> 36:07.356
One, two, three, go!

36:32.788 --> 36:37.958
Joe MacDonald wins easily.
Archie MacDonald
better buck his ideas up!

36:38.041 --> 36:39.750
(SHEEP BLEATING)

36:56.136 --> 36:59.178
-KILWILLIE: The second
part of the challenge...
-Swap.

36:59.262 --> 37:03.889
...tests the rivals' knowledge
of the clan they wish to lead.

37:03.973 --> 37:07.892
I have selected 10 questions,
five for each candidate,

37:07.976 --> 37:10.811
about the history
of the MacDonalds.

37:18.482 --> 37:21.400
Katrina!
I need to talk to you.

37:21.483 --> 37:23.943
I don't want to talk to you.
I'm going home.

37:24.027 --> 37:27.029
Look, I spoke out
of turn last night.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.947
I want to make it right.

37:31.531 --> 37:33.991
Each candidate has
dropped only one point.

37:34.074 --> 37:36.285
So we have a tie at four-all.

37:36.367 --> 37:39.411
I'm going to ask
a tie-break question.

37:39.494 --> 37:45.373
How did Angus
MacDonald choose Glenbogle
to be the site of his castle?

37:49.167 --> 37:53.295
ARCHIE: I know this,
something to do with
a hawthorn tree. Um...

38:04.176 --> 38:08.054
(STAMMERING) He
strapped a chest of gold
to the back of a donkey,

38:08.137 --> 38:11.014
let it wander over his lands.
It headed for the loch,

38:11.097 --> 38:13.973
stopped by
a hawthorn tree and urinated.

38:14.057 --> 38:16.308
And that's where
he built his castle.

38:16.391 --> 38:18.727
-KILWILLIE:
Are you sure about that?
-Yes.

38:18.809 --> 38:21.645
-You don't want to
change your mind?
-No.

38:24.229 --> 38:25.856
-Correct!
-Yes!

38:29.358 --> 38:34.069
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and
gentlemen, the final part of
the chieftain's challenge

38:34.152 --> 38:36.654
will take place
in five minutes.

38:42.783 --> 38:46.326
-Lexie,
I've not got time for this.
-Well, make time. Sit down.

38:49.244 --> 38:54.414
Now, I want to talk to you
about Katrina. Why aren't
the pair of you together?

38:56.707 --> 38:58.959
I don't know.

38:59.042 --> 39:01.794
Maybe because
there's always been
something in the way.

39:01.877 --> 39:05.880
First, it was Justine,
then there was Fergal.

39:05.964 --> 39:10.383
Now he's gone, I don't know,
we just can't seem
to reach each other.

39:10.466 --> 39:13.093
LEXIE: Never mind that.
That's all in the past.

39:13.176 --> 39:18.012
The only important thing
is how you feel
about each other now.

39:18.096 --> 39:21.722
ARCHIE:
Well, I feel the same way
that I've always felt.

39:22.807 --> 39:24.766
LEXIE: Which is, Arch?

39:26.642 --> 39:29.519
ARCHIE: I'm nuts about her.
End of story.

39:31.812 --> 39:35.398
Archie? It's time,
old boy. You're on.

39:37.274 --> 39:40.859
Now, don't you think
you better do
something about it?

39:57.869 --> 40:01.454
For goodness sake, girl.
Go and say something to him.

40:05.499 --> 40:07.917
-Archie, I...
-Come on, my boy.

40:08.001 --> 40:10.294
We're all ready. Over there.

40:12.086 --> 40:13.462
Good luck.

40:15.547 --> 40:21.925
Ladies and gentlemen,
the final and deciding
test of the challenge.

40:22.009 --> 40:27.304
With this challenge for
the great sword of
the MacDonald of Glenbogle,

40:27.387 --> 40:33.516
twenty generations
loyal to the Bonnie Prince
have chosen their laird.

40:33.600 --> 40:40.228
Challengers, you will
draw the hilt unto you
until a flash of green or red

40:40.312 --> 40:45.481
doth touch the sacred soil
here in
the shadow of Ben Bogle.

40:46.481 --> 40:49.358
Gentlemen, address the sword.

40:51.610 --> 40:55.070
Gentlemen,
commence the struggle.

40:55.738 --> 40:57.488
(ALL CHEERING)

42:01.526 --> 42:04.987
KILWILLIE:
I declare Archie MacDonald

42:05.071 --> 42:09.323
to be the right and
true chief of his clan!

42:19.079 --> 42:24.374
I failed.
I failed you, I failed Angus.

42:26.291 --> 42:28.876
-In fact, I failed Joe Jr.
-Joe.

42:30.419 --> 42:32.337
I'm scared, Bonnie.

42:32.420 --> 42:36.214
It's like I'm looking into
a black hole and there's
Joe Jr staring back at me.

42:36.297 --> 42:42.218
Joe, maybe someone failed him.
Maybe you and me,
maybe even himself.

42:44.469 --> 42:48.972
We have to face up to this,
and we're gonna
do it together,

42:49.055 --> 42:51.765
and we're gonna do
it at home, okay?

43:00.688 --> 43:04.648
Let's go find Ricky.
He needs a father, too.

43:04.731 --> 43:07.191
Hey,
guess what he just called me.

43:07.275 --> 43:09.234
-What?
-Unc Dunc.

43:11.235 --> 43:13.820
I've never been
an uncle before.

43:15.113 --> 43:18.031
HECTOR: Members of the clan.

43:18.115 --> 43:22.075
The time has come for
me to lay down my burden,

43:22.158 --> 43:25.995
and for a fitter, younger man
to take the reins of office.

43:26.828 --> 43:28.079
My son.

43:32.540 --> 43:37.126
Archibald Horatio
Hector MacDonald,

43:37.209 --> 43:42.796
do you pledge to uphold
the traditions of
the MacDonalds of Glenbogle,

43:42.880 --> 43:46.798
and to keep forever
a home in the hills
for members of the clan,

43:46.882 --> 43:49.383
wherever they may have roamed?

43:49.466 --> 43:51.051
I do so pledge.

43:54.094 --> 43:57.805
I hand to you the ancient keys
of the house of MacDonald

43:57.889 --> 44:00.098
and trust them to your care.

44:05.810 --> 44:11.396
I now pronounce you chieftain
of this proud clan and master
of these men assembled.

44:20.903 --> 44:24.613
Well, laddie, you tell them.

44:24.696 --> 44:28.948
I've been
thinking about this day
for most of my life.

44:29.032 --> 44:33.160
Thinking about it,
but never
expecting it to happen.

44:33.243 --> 44:36.495
Firstly, because it was
never supposed to be me.

44:36.578 --> 44:41.581
And then when suddenly,
terribly, it was,

44:41.664 --> 44:46.209
I... I ran away
because I didn't want it.
Or so I thought.

44:48.127 --> 44:50.587
And now, finally,

44:52.046 --> 44:55.298
crazily, I'm standing here,

44:55.381 --> 44:59.425
holding these funny old keys,
saying those funny old words,

44:59.509 --> 45:04.053
and all of a sudden
it just seems right.

45:06.805 --> 45:10.808
I've made my pledge,
and I will work
hard to keep it.

45:13.559 --> 45:15.602
Long live the MacDonalds!

45:25.024 --> 45:31.319
I want to thank those people
who helped me and I want them
to come and join me up here.

45:33.530 --> 45:36.906
My father and
Duncan are already here.

45:38.949 --> 45:42.076
The best gillie in Scotland,
Golly Mackenzie.

45:50.289 --> 45:52.249
My dear mother, Molly.

46:01.671 --> 46:05.423
My very, very best pal, Lexie.

46:20.724 --> 46:25.686
And finally, our ex-head
teacher, ex-councillor,

46:25.769 --> 46:29.354
but hopefully not ex-friend,
Katrina Finlay.

46:49.616 --> 46:51.826
Is that the best you can do?

47:07.002 --> 47:11.337
Right, everyone back to the
house for the opening of
the visitors' centre

47:11.421 --> 47:14.715
and the wildest hooley in
the history of the clan.

47:20.886 --> 47:22.970
ALL: # A moo-moo here and a
moo-moo there here a moo,

47:23.053 --> 47:25.013
there a moo, everywhere
a moo-moo

# Old MacDonald
had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

47:28.598 --> 47:32.851
# Old MacDonald
had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

47:32.934 --> 47:37.187
# And on that farm he
had a duck, E-I-E-I-O

47:37.270 --> 47:39.605
# With a quack-quack here,
and a quack-quack there

47:39.688 --> 47:41.898
# Here a quack, there a quack,
everywhere a quack-quack

# Old MacDonald had a farm...
#

47:45.233 --> 47:46.692
Driver,what are
you playing at?

47:46.776 --> 47:49.068
It's the bridge.
It's not safe.

47:49.152 --> 47:53.322
It's been there for 140 years,
man. It's not likely
to fall down now.

47:54.781 --> 47:56.865
(ALL CHEERING)

47:56.948 --> 48:00.451
Go, Hector! All right!

48:08.289 --> 48:12.708
-MAN: Well done!
-Right, get on,
I take full responsibility.

48:12.792 --> 48:14.793
Where were we?

48:14.876 --> 48:19.420
# Old MacDonald
had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

48:19.504 --> 48:22.005
# And on that farm
he had a pig... #

48:25.883 --> 48:29.551
May God bless her
and all who buy
knick-knacks in her.

48:33.221 --> 48:35.722
-Will you stop doing that?
-What?

48:35.806 --> 48:39.307
Grinning like a loon.
You've done nothing
else for the last hour.

48:39.391 --> 48:43.102
What do you expect?
All my Christmases
have come at once.

48:44.394 --> 48:46.561
(HECTOR CLEARING THROAT)

48:46.645 --> 48:48.355
HECTOR: Thank you.

48:49.105 --> 48:50.856
Father?

48:50.940 --> 48:53.607
Are you all right?
What's happened?

48:54.483 --> 48:56.109
I...

48:56.192 --> 48:59.194
I think you'd better
come and have a look.

49:27.378 --> 49:31.088
Shouldn't be too difficult
to fix. Just the odd
new girder or two.

49:31.171 --> 49:33.298
And the odd hundred grand.

49:39.593 --> 49:43.304
It's okay.
Be calm. It's all right.

49:43.388 --> 49:47.515
So this may be the only way
in or out. We'll just have to
ferry the visitors across.

49:47.598 --> 49:51.559
It's no big deal.
This sort of thing
happens every day, right?

49:56.311 --> 49:58.604
