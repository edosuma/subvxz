00:35.269 --> 00:39.171
<i>As Juliana Bordereau
sat there before me,</i>

00:39.173 --> 00:41.807
<i>my heart beat as fast as if the
miracle of resurrection</i>

00:41.809 --> 00:45.477
<i>had taken place solely for my
benefit.</i>

00:45.479 --> 00:48.680
<i>Her presence
seemed somehow to contain his,</i>

00:48.682 --> 00:51.683
<i>and I felt nearer to him at that
first moment of seeing her</i>

00:51.685 --> 00:53.986
<i>than I ever had before,</i>

00:53.988 --> 00:57.289
<i>or ever have since.</i>

00:57.291 --> 01:01.393
<i>I felt an irresistible desire
to hold in my own, for a moment,</i>

01:01.395 --> 01:04.296
<i>the hand that Jeffrey Aspern
had pressed.</i>

01:16.510 --> 01:19.511
<i>One doesn't defend one's god.</i>

01:19.513 --> 01:21.780
<i>One's god is in himself a
defence.</i>

01:28.689 --> 01:32.458
<i>Today Jeffrey Aspern shines high
in the heaven of our literature</i>

01:32.460 --> 01:33.759
<i>for all the world to see.</i>

01:35.463 --> 01:37.930
<i>He is a part of the light
by which we walk.</i>

01:42.369 --> 01:46.572
<i>He had been not only one of the
most brilliant poets of his day,</i>

01:46.574 --> 01:49.041
<i>but one of the most genial men</i>

01:49.043 --> 01:52.544
<i>and one of the handsomest.</i>

01:52.546 --> 01:56.548
<i>His early death had been the
only dark spot in his life,</i>

01:56.550 --> 01:58.550
<i>unless the papers
in Miss Bordereau's hands</i>

01:58.552 --> 02:01.153
<i>should perversely bring out
others.</i>

02:07.661 --> 02:11.296
<i>By what passions
had he been ravaged?</i>

02:11.298 --> 02:14.633
<i>By what sufferings
had she been blanched?</i>

03:47.628 --> 03:51.063
Our house is very far from the
centre,

03:51.065 --> 03:54.566
but the little canal is <i> comme il</i>
<i>faut</i>.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.902
Very respectable.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.539
It's the sweetest corner of
Venice.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.508
I can imagine nothing more
charming.

04:03.510 --> 04:08.847
There's no need to raise your
voice. I can hear you perfectly.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.183
Please do sit down over there.

04:11.185 --> 04:14.853
Do tell me
what you might expect from me.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.389
Well...

04:17.391 --> 04:20.024
Perhaps the young lady who so
kindly received me yesterday

04:20.027 --> 04:23.328
explained to you about the
garden.

04:23.330 --> 04:26.832
Your garden gave me the courage
to take a step so unconventional.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.434
I thought I might find lodgings
here.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.606
Mr Edward Sullivan.
To see Miss Bordereau.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.407
Excuse me.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.076
The garden.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.644
Is it yours?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.480
The garden?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.816
Nothing here is mine.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.152
But surely the garden
must belong to the house?

05:20.154 --> 05:23.822
Yes, but the house doesn't
belong to me.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.059
Then would you tell me
to whom I must address myself?

05:27.061 --> 05:28.360
You know...

05:29.330 --> 05:31.496
I'm looking for a garden.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.133
It's absurd if you like,
for a man, but...

05:35.135 --> 05:37.502
I can't live without flowers.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.138
There are none to speak of down
there.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.507
It costs too much to cultivate
them.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.810
One has to have a man.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.545
Why should I not be that man?

05:48.182 --> 05:50.515
You shall have
the finest flowers in Venice.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.651
But I don't know you.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.187
Oh, you know me as much as I
know you.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.523
That is to say much more,
as you now know my name.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.664
If you're so fond of gardens,

06:05.666 --> 06:08.400
why don't you go to <i> terra firma</i>
,

06:08.402 --> 06:11.136
where there are so many
far better than mine?

06:12.306 --> 06:14.639
It's the combination.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.842
The idea of a garden
in the middle of the sea.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.745
It's not in the middle of the
sea!

06:22.149 --> 06:24.750
It's many years

06:24.752 --> 06:29.020
since I have been
in one of the <i> gondolas</i>.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.390
Well, let me assure you of the
pleasure

06:31.392 --> 06:33.225
at which I would put mine at
your service.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.697
You're English, are you not?

06:38.699 --> 06:40.599
If you are, I'm almost a
countryman.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.136
We're not English.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.071
You don't mean to say
you're an American?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.807
I don't know.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.209
Used to be.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.345
Used to be?

06:53.347 --> 06:55.046
It's been so many years...

06:55.048 --> 06:58.517
We're... nothing now.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.153
I'm not going to take anything
from you.

07:01.155 --> 07:03.288
I have some writing to do.

07:03.290 --> 07:07.325
I would like some quiet over a
period, possibly all winter.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.328
I also need a great deal of open
air.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.863
I find a garden is really...

07:12.733 --> 07:14.232
indispensable.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.402
Nothing will change for you
all...

07:17.404 --> 07:20.205
except, of course, the flowers.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.506
For us all?

07:21.508 --> 07:23.408
I mean all your family...

07:23.410 --> 07:25.310
However many you are.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.712
There's only one other...

07:27.714 --> 07:29.347
She's very old.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.416
Only one other,

07:31.418 --> 07:33.718
in all this place?

07:33.720 --> 07:36.221
Surely then you have space to
spare.

07:36.223 --> 07:40.192
If you could let me two, three
rooms, it would greatly assist me.

07:40.194 --> 07:43.562
Er... I can't decide anything.

07:43.564 --> 07:47.065
You must see my aunt.

07:47.067 --> 07:52.504
The young lady who received you
so kindly, as you say,

07:52.506 --> 07:53.738
is my niece.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.740
Her name is Tina.

07:55.742 --> 07:59.878
She will come in, but I wished
to see you alone for a moment.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.714
I'll be delighted
to see your niece again.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.317
Miss Tina was so very courteous
to me.

08:05.319 --> 08:09.387
She has very good manners.
I bred her up myself.

08:09.389 --> 08:12.023
I imagine she must have thought
me very odd.

08:12.025 --> 08:15.694
It matters little
how odd you are.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.997
I don't care who you are.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.133
It signifies very little today.

08:22.135 --> 08:26.471
- Am I to understand...?
- There's nothing to understand.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.373
Just listen... carefully.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.644
You may have

08:32.645 --> 08:35.714
as many rooms as you like...

08:35.716 --> 08:39.885
if you will pay me
a great deal of money.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.285
I will pay with pleasure

08:41.288 --> 08:42.888
and of course in advance

08:42.890 --> 08:45.056
whatever you think it proper
to ask of me.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.193
Well, then, a thousand francs a
month.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.330
A thousand...

08:54.801 --> 08:57.669
My dear lady,
your views perfectly fit my own.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.304
Tomorrow I shall have the
pleasure

08:59.306 --> 09:00.906
of putting three months' rent
into your hand.

09:02.676 --> 09:07.846
- Three thousand...
- Three thousand francs?

09:07.848 --> 09:12.284
Oh, did you mean francs or
dollars?

09:12.286 --> 09:14.486
I think francs were what you
said.

09:14.488 --> 09:17.656
Oh... that seems to be very good
to me.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.158
What do you know? How do you
know?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.895
You have always been ignorant
of these matters, praise God.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.132
That's quite true.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.733
I know nothing about money.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.136
Nothing at all.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.039
You have your own branches of
knowledge, I'm sure.

09:34.041 --> 09:37.242
Well, she had
a very good English education

09:37.244 --> 09:39.177
when she was young.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.346
But she's learned nothing since.

09:41.348 --> 09:45.183
That's because
I've always been with you.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.719
But for that...

09:47.721 --> 09:50.689
What time will you come tomorrow
with the money?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.791
If it suits you, I'll come at
noon.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.326
It suits me.

09:54.328 --> 09:57.529
I will see you at noon, with the
money.

09:57.531 --> 09:58.630
I'll be punctual.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.435
May I shake your hand
on our contract?

10:06.406 --> 10:10.909
I belong to a time
when that was not the custom.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.313
And you, miss,

10:15.315 --> 10:17.182
will you shake my hand?

10:17.184 --> 10:19.384
Surely you accept the custom of
our day.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.188
Will you bring the money in
gold?

10:24.725 --> 10:26.825
In gold?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.794
Aren't you a little afraid to keep
such a sum in gold in the house?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.963
Of whom should I be afraid
if I'm not afraid of you?

10:33.066 --> 10:34.833
Quite.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.735
I'll bring gold if you prefer.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.203
Yes.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.438
I prefer, since I asked.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.141
Hm.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.645
This conversation has tired me.
I want you to go now.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.369
<i> The strange thing is</i>

11:11.371 --> 11:14.472
<i>I've discovered Juliana
Bordereau is still alive.</i>

11:14.474 --> 11:17.475
It's as if I've discovered
the famous Lady Hamilton is.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.045
And she belongs
to a generation just as extinct.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.716
Every one of Aspern's
contemporaries has passed.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.052
I haven't been able to look
into a single pair of eyes

11:27.054 --> 11:29.120
that his might have looked into.

11:29.122 --> 11:33.191
Or transmitted contact from an
aged hand that his has touched.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.060
In all my years of research,

11:35.062 --> 11:38.563
I've encountered phantoms,
ghosts,

11:38.565 --> 11:40.565
echoes of echoes,

11:40.567 --> 11:44.002
when the one source of information
that has lingered on into our time

11:44.004 --> 11:46.137
has been unheeded by me.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.206
Why don't you simply offer them
a sum of money?

11:48.208 --> 11:51.643
In that way you might obtain her letters
without so many sleepless nights.

11:51.645 --> 11:54.646
She would never accept money
for anything so valuable.

11:56.983 --> 12:00.118
The world has recognised Jeffrey
Aspern,

12:00.120 --> 12:02.320
and I've recognised him most.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.323
I've done more for his memory
than anyone else,

12:05.325 --> 12:08.626
and I've done it by shinning a
light into his life.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.796
And into yours.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.036
"Ere Babylon was dust,

12:18.038 --> 12:21.239
the Magus Zoroaster, my dead
child,

12:21.241 --> 12:24.576
met his own image walking in the
garden.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.578
That apparition,

12:26.580 --> 12:28.546
sole of men,

12:28.548 --> 12:30.048
he saw."

12:30.050 --> 12:31.883
One of Aspern's poems?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.853
Of course.

12:34.855 --> 12:38.623
You're too fond of mystery.
That's your great fault.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.893
But you'll have to change your
name.

12:41.895 --> 12:46.164
Juliana lives out of the world
as much as it's possible to live.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.033
Nonetheless, she's probably
heard of Mr Aspern's editors.

12:49.035 --> 12:51.669
She may know
about what you've published,

12:51.671 --> 12:53.671
may even have read it.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.041
I've thought of that.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.580
Duplicity is my only course.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.983
First I have to sit down with
her,

13:04.985 --> 13:07.152
then tackle the main job.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.055
Or else seduce the niece.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.037
Isn't it charming?
It's grey and pink.

13:26.039 --> 13:30.642
It hasn't got an air so much of
decay as of... quiet discouragement.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.677
Quite, I'll say.

13:32.679 --> 13:36.815
Even though you can pass on foot,
scarcely anyone thinks of doing so.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.485
Perhaps the people are afraid
of the Misses Bordereau.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.454
They have the reputation of
witches.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.956
Wish me luck.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.866
I've had better fortune
than I hoped.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.635
Tell me, how did you manage to
convince her?

13:57.637 --> 14:01.339
Oh, it was the idea of the money
that convinced her.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.176
That was your only argument?

14:05.178 --> 14:08.813
And that I said that I
thought she'd get a good deal.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.548
That I thought you were rich.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.151
And what put that idea into your
head?

14:13.153 --> 14:15.854
I don't know...
The way that you talked.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.422
Oh, dear.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.525
I think I must talk differently.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.360
I'm afraid my voice has deceived
you.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.630
Do you think it's too much?

14:25.632 --> 14:29.234
That depends on the amount of
pleasure I get for it.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.835
Pleasure?

14:30.837 --> 14:33.371
There is no pleasure in this
house.

14:41.248 --> 14:45.283
So, this is where your aunt
would like me to be?

14:45.285 --> 14:48.486
She said your rooms
ought to be very distinct.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.122
Apart. You know?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.491
That would certainly be best.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.127
I don't know if it'll make
any difference to you,

14:56.129 --> 14:58.630
but the money is for me.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.132
Money?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.067
The money you are going to
bring.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.969
You'll make me want to stay
three years.

15:04.971 --> 15:07.972
Well, that would be
very good for me.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.176
She wants me to have something.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.646
She fears that she's going to
die.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.314
Not soon, I hope.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.548
Why do you say that?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.351
Not soon.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.720
It's as if you feared something.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.289
No, no, no, no.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.692
I hope she's not seriously ill.

15:27.694 --> 15:28.860
For her sake.

15:29.629 --> 15:30.862
And for yours.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.764
No.

15:33.833 --> 15:37.402
She's just very tired. That's
all.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.537
She's tired of everything.

15:39.539 --> 15:44.809
She's lived so many years, she said
she'd like to try dying for a change.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.911
All her friends died long ago

15:46.913 --> 15:50.915
and either they ought to have remained
or she ought to have gone with them.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.951
- That's what she says.
- Hm.

15:54.654 --> 15:58.222
But people don't die when they
want, do they?

15:58.224 --> 16:00.858
I guess she won't have much to
say to me while I'm here.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.961
No.

16:02.963 --> 16:07.065
There's nothing to tell.
We live such a quiet life.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.233
I don't know how the days pass,
I...

16:11.671 --> 16:12.637
You're very trusting.

16:14.874 --> 16:18.076
- Trusting?
- Mm-hm.

16:18.078 --> 16:22.447
I... I suppose that I am a
trusting person.

16:28.054 --> 16:31.356
<i> As soon as my rooms had
been arranged, I surveyed the place,</i>

16:31.358 --> 16:34.192
<i>looking for my opportunity.</i>

16:34.194 --> 16:36.127
<i>Yet you can push through a
breach</i>

16:36.129 --> 16:39.397
<i>but you can't batter down a dead
wall.</i>

16:39.399 --> 16:41.299
<i>They were like two hunted
creatures</i>

16:42.202 --> 16:43.801
<i>feigning death.</i>

16:46.072 --> 16:50.875
<i>I made a point of spending as much
time as possible in the garden</i>

16:50.877 --> 16:55.046
<i>to justify the picture I had originally
given of my horticultural passion.</i>

16:59.185 --> 17:03.454
<i>And I not only spent time,
but considerable money.</i>

17:03.456 --> 17:05.123
We got a lot of work to do.
Come with me.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.726
<i>I had to be consistent.</i>

17:08.728 --> 17:12.530
<i>Keep my promise that I would
smother the house with flowers.</i>

17:12.531 --> 17:18.469
<i>I had formed this project that
by flowers I would make my way.</i>

17:24.978 --> 17:28.679
<i>I used to watch,
as long as I thought decent,</i>

17:28.681 --> 17:33.451
<i>the door that led to Miss
Bordereau's part of the house.</i>

17:33.453 --> 17:38.389
<i>A person observing me might have thought
I was trying to cast a spell on her door</i>

17:38.391 --> 17:43.561
<i>or was attempting some odd
experiment in hypnotism.</i>

17:43.563 --> 17:47.965
<i>But I was not rewarded with a
glimpse of the tail of her dress.</i>

17:47.967 --> 17:52.103
<i>It was as if she had never
peeped out of her apartment.</i>

18:05.785 --> 18:08.453
<i>What store of passionate
memories</i>

18:08.455 --> 18:13.191
<i>had Juliana laid away
for the monotonous future?</i>

18:13.193 --> 18:16.227
"A secret
known to none but thee

18:16.229 --> 18:18.996
and no one else of living
things..."

18:28.241 --> 18:32.243
<i>She was the daughter of an
artist, a painter, a sculptor</i>

18:32.245 --> 18:34.912
<i>who had left America
when the century was fresh.</i>

18:37.217 --> 18:39.817
<i>Upon her arrival in Europe,</i>

18:39.819 --> 18:43.087
<i>she surrounded herself
with poets and writers.</i>

18:45.558 --> 18:47.658
<i>There was an implication</i>

18:47.660 --> 18:50.561
<i>that she'd had an adventurous
and fascinating character.</i>

19:32.705 --> 19:36.641
I'm so glad you've
come!

19:36.643 --> 19:39.644
You speak as if you were lost in
the woods.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.846
How you manage to stay out of
this charming place

19:41.848 --> 19:44.382
when you have only three feet
to get into it...

19:44.384 --> 19:46.717
It's more
than I've been able to discover.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.887
Tell me.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.823
How do you manage without air,

19:52.825 --> 19:54.792
without movement,

19:54.794 --> 19:57.728
without any sort
of contact from outside?

19:59.666 --> 20:01.933
We go to bed very early.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.603
Well... earlier than you'd
imagine.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.342
Do you know...

20:11.344 --> 20:14.312
I've never been out here
at this time of day.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.213
Never?

20:16.683 --> 20:18.316
In this fragrant place,

20:18.318 --> 20:20.952
blooming right here under your
nose?

20:20.954 --> 20:23.354
It was never nice till now.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.555
You know,

20:24.557 --> 20:27.225
I must confess...

20:27.227 --> 20:30.828
I've wondered why you've never
given me the slightest sign.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.398
You've never thanked me in any way
for the flowers I've been sending up.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.167
I didn't know they were for me.

20:36.169 --> 20:39.237
They were for you both.
Why should I make a difference?

20:44.210 --> 20:45.810
Why do you want to know us?

20:48.248 --> 20:50.147
Now, that question is your
aunt's.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.849
It isn't yours.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.884
You wouldn't ask it
if you weren't put up to it.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.387
She didn't tell me to ask you
it.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.124
Well...

21:00.126 --> 21:03.828
does your aunt see anything wrong with
the idea of two intelligent people,

21:03.830 --> 21:06.230
living under the same roof as we
do,

21:06.232 --> 21:08.566
occasionally exchanging a
remark?

21:10.303 --> 21:14.405
You know, we share some of the
same tastes.

21:14.407 --> 21:18.409
Like you, I am intensely fond of
Venice.

21:18.411 --> 21:22.213
Oh, I'm not in the least bit
fond of Venice.

21:22.215 --> 21:24.248
I should like to go far away
from it.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.785
You don't like Venice?

21:27.787 --> 21:29.787
And you wish to go far away from
it

21:29.789 --> 21:32.290
when you won't even go
to Piazza San Marco?

21:32.292 --> 21:35.026
Has your aunt always
held you back so?

21:35.028 --> 21:38.696
No. She's the one
that told me to come out today.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.564
It was I that didn't want to
come.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.800
I didn't want to leave her.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.169
Is she unwell?

21:45.171 --> 21:48.539
She hasn't been very well
recently.

21:48.541 --> 21:52.710
Sometimes she's so motionless
that I fear she's dead.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.846
But she insists
on getting up every morning.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.049
She clings to her old habits

21:58.051 --> 22:00.484
as if it would keep her steady.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.553
She makes a point
of sitting in the parlour

22:02.555 --> 22:05.189
as if she was expecting a
visitor.

22:05.191 --> 22:09.327
- She used to receive visitors, then?
- Oh, yes.

22:09.329 --> 22:14.365
When we first came to Venice
we had a brilliant life.

22:14.367 --> 22:18.903
We visited all the palazzi,
the churches, the galleries...

22:20.340 --> 22:22.840
- Who did you know?
- Oh, so many.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.676
And nice ones. Um...

22:25.678 --> 22:30.047
The Cavaliere Bombicci
and the Contessa Altemura.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.350
We had a very great friendship
with her.

22:32.352 --> 22:36.987
The Chiltons, the Goldies...
Oh, and Mrs Stokes.

22:36.989 --> 22:40.191
Oh, I loved her so much.

22:40.193 --> 22:43.994
She's gone now, as are most
people from that circle.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.600
Mm... it's getting late now.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.169
You really have to go?

22:52.171 --> 22:54.739
Yes. I must.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.674
When shall I see you again?

22:56.676 --> 23:00.411
I would like to come out
tomorrow night but...

23:00.413 --> 23:03.214
Well, I'm so far
from doing what I'd like.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.116
You might do something I like.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.186
I don't believe you.

23:09.188 --> 23:12.022
Why? Why don't you believe me?

23:12.024 --> 23:13.891
I don't know, I...

23:13.893 --> 23:16.293
I suppose it's because I don't
understand you.

23:16.295 --> 23:19.663
That is just the sort of
occasion to have faith.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.801
Have faith in me.

23:51.497 --> 23:52.563
Mother.

23:54.233 --> 23:58.135
You've arrived just in time

23:58.137 --> 24:01.872
to meet the most mysterious man
I know, Mr Morton Vint.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.908
Good morning, ladies.

24:03.910 --> 24:07.178
Valentina, you look lovely, and Emily,
you look like a flower in bloom.

24:07.180 --> 24:10.080
May I tell it to Mother?

24:10.082 --> 24:11.482
Well, don't mind Mr Vint.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.951
He's well practised in keeping
secrets.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.821
- Emily is to be married.
- How can this be?

24:16.823 --> 24:19.156
The last time I saw you,
you were with the nuns.

24:19.158 --> 24:23.027
I often wonder if the nuns shouldn't
have kept her a few years more.

24:23.029 --> 24:25.029
And who might this man
be

24:25.031 --> 24:27.231
that has broken you from the
shackles of the convent?

24:27.233 --> 24:28.532
It's Lord Fullerton.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.468
Mother chose him for me.

24:30.470 --> 24:33.337
It's just like your mother
to have such ideas.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.339
- Elizabeth.
- Adriana.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.844
- You look stunning.
- Oh, thank you.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.680
You two must have
many more secrets to exchange.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.616
And Morton has some things
he'd like to share with me

24:45.618 --> 24:49.320
and I can see he's getting quite
impatient to do so.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.289
He's lodging with the Misses
Bordereau.

24:52.291 --> 24:56.994
I haven't heard that name for years.
How is the niece? How do you like her?

24:56.996 --> 24:58.529
Morton, do tell.

24:58.531 --> 25:01.499
What news, if any,
of your dear Miss Tina?

25:01.501 --> 25:04.535
His interest in some papers
has become quite a fixed idea.

25:04.537 --> 25:07.371
What papers of value
could they possibly have?

25:07.373 --> 25:09.573
That
is what I'm trying to find out.

25:09.575 --> 25:11.642
I mean,
these two are from another age.

25:11.644 --> 25:14.545
Yes, their manner
has very little to do with ours.

25:14.547 --> 25:17.882
So, what more have you learned
from her?

25:17.884 --> 25:21.151
I've learned that her mind
is essentially vague about...

25:21.153 --> 25:23.487
dates and the order
in which events occurred.

25:23.489 --> 25:26.323
Her story doesn't quite hang
together.

25:26.325 --> 25:29.627
I've even asked myself if she's
trying to lay a trap for me.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.629
To make you show your hand, you
mean?

25:31.631 --> 25:33.797
Mm-hm.

25:33.799 --> 25:37.902
I mean, perhaps she doesn't even know
of the existence of these... papers.

25:39.505 --> 25:40.571
I wrote to her.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.173
You never told me that.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.909
Six months before I arrived.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.744
Did she answer?

25:46.746 --> 25:48.646
Yes.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.514
To the second letter.

25:50.516 --> 25:52.349
She answered in six lines.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.385
And what did she say?

25:54.387 --> 25:59.189
Miss Bordereau requested that she
had none of Mr Aspern's papers.

25:59.191 --> 26:02.359
And even if she did, she would not
think of showing them to anybody

26:02.361 --> 26:04.695
on any account whatsoever.

26:04.697 --> 26:08.365
Maybe after all this they don't
have any of his things.

26:08.367 --> 26:11.802
If they so flatly deny it,
how can you be sure?

26:11.804 --> 26:13.170
I am sure.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.805
On what evidence?

26:14.807 --> 26:16.740
Her calling him "Mr Aspern".

26:16.742 --> 26:19.176
I don't see what that proves.

26:19.178 --> 26:25.215
It proves familiarity, and familiarity
implies possession of mementos.

26:25.217 --> 26:29.887
You don't say "Mr Byron"
or "Mr Shakespeare", do you?

26:29.889 --> 26:33.190
Would I, any more, if I had a
box full of his love letters?

26:33.192 --> 26:37.494
Yes, if you had been his lover

26:37.496 --> 26:39.463
and someone wanted them.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.570
<i> It was part of my idea</i>

26:46.572 --> 26:49.573
<i>that there had been another love
affair,</i>

26:49.575 --> 26:52.810
<i>broken by some tragic rupture.</i>

27:31.851 --> 27:33.283
I thought you wouldn't come.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.220
I wanted to tell you
that...

27:37.289 --> 27:40.024
I shall like the flowers better

27:40.026 --> 27:43.494
now that I know they're also for
me.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.230
How could you have doubted it?

27:46.232 --> 27:49.133
Shall I send up a double lot of
them to prove it to you?

27:49.135 --> 27:53.537
Don't go to the
trouble, the idea's enough.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.810
Do you study at night?

27:59.812 --> 28:03.380
When you go up to your room,
do you read and write?

28:03.382 --> 28:06.984
Not at night. The lamplight
brings in the insects.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.990
But... in winter do you work at
night?

28:12.992 --> 28:15.526
Yes, I do.

28:15.528 --> 28:19.396
I read a great deal
but I usually don't write.

28:19.398 --> 28:23.233
Before I go to sleep,
I usually read some great poet.

28:23.235 --> 28:26.103
Nine out of ten times
it's a volume by...

28:27.306 --> 28:29.206
Jeffrey Aspern.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.509
Oh...

28:32.511 --> 28:34.078
We read him.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.846
We have read him.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.782
He is my poet of poets.

28:38.784 --> 28:40.551
I know him almost by heart.

28:40.553 --> 28:43.353
By heart - oh, that's nothing.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.656
My aunt used to know him.

28:45.658 --> 28:47.191
As a visitor?

28:47.193 --> 28:50.661
Yes. He used to come here and
take her out.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.565
But he died a hundred years ago.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.568
That's nothing,
my aunt's a hundred and fifty.

28:59.805 --> 29:02.673
Why have you not told me this
before?

29:02.675 --> 29:04.908
I should like to speak to her
about him.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.911
You should have come
twenty years ago, then.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.913
She still spoke about him.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.415
And what did she say?

29:12.651 --> 29:14.718
She said that...

29:15.621 --> 29:17.688
he liked her immensely.

29:17.690 --> 29:20.090
And she didn't like him?

29:21.160 --> 29:22.593
She said he was a god.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.335
Has she got a portrait of him?

29:31.337 --> 29:35.706
It would be a true find.
They are very rare.

29:35.708 --> 29:37.040
Tell me this, please.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.177
A portrait...

29:40.179 --> 29:42.746
Um... I've never seen one.

29:42.748 --> 29:45.182
Surely you would know if she had
a portrait of the god?

29:45.184 --> 29:49.019
I don't know what she has.
She keeps her things locked up.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.723
Then she cannot have one.

29:52.725 --> 29:54.792
She wouldn't keep it locked up.

29:54.794 --> 29:58.629
She would hang it in a place
of prominence in her parlour.

29:58.631 --> 30:02.499
Any admirer of Aspern would do
the same. I would do so myself.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.335
I would be only too glad
to work under his gaze.

30:05.337 --> 30:08.839
I would be encouraged by his
presence.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.542
When dejected, I would console
myself with his example.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.110
His example?

30:15.181 --> 30:17.314
Do you write about him?

30:17.316 --> 30:19.683
Do I write? Oh, please.

30:19.685 --> 30:23.487
Let us not discuss my writing
when we talk about Jeffrey Aspern.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.722
Do you pry into his life?

30:27.860 --> 30:30.694
Now I seem to hear
your aunt's voice again.

30:30.696 --> 30:33.363
It's not like you to use such
terms.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.299
Do I pry into his life?

30:35.301 --> 30:37.801
Then all the more the reason
that you should answer plainly.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.837
Tell me.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.139
Are you prying into his life?

30:42.141 --> 30:43.440
Yes.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.310
I write about him.

30:46.312 --> 30:49.146
I have written about him and I
will write about him again.

30:50.149 --> 30:52.482
Please tell me.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.885
Does your aunt have any poems,

30:54.887 --> 30:57.888
letters, papers, unpublished
documents, anything...

30:57.890 --> 31:00.157
belonging to Jeffrey Aspern?

31:08.534 --> 31:10.500
Do you find him handsome?

31:10.502 --> 31:12.469
I don't know. He seems strange.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.342
I know who I would rather have
as my husband.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.043
You like him that much?

31:22.181 --> 31:25.048
What might you ladies be laughing about?
Would you mind sharing it with us?

31:28.554 --> 31:31.221
Morton, whatever is happening?
You look like a mad man.

31:34.793 --> 31:38.161
Five days I've been sitting
in that garden waiting for her.

31:38.163 --> 31:40.898
Sending flowers up by the
bushel. And nothing.

31:40.900 --> 31:44.868
What am I to do? I can't
exactly break into her room.

31:44.870 --> 31:49.740
You might have to come up with something
new, then, to trigger a reaction.

31:49.742 --> 31:53.310
And what would make you react?
As a woman.

31:53.312 --> 31:54.912
As a woman?

31:57.449 --> 32:00.017
I don't think Miss Tina
is quite a woman,

32:00.019 --> 32:03.053
but Miss Bordereau definitely
is.

32:03.055 --> 32:05.122
Ladies, what would you say?

32:05.124 --> 32:07.224
You send her flowers every day?

32:07.226 --> 32:08.859
I would like that very much.

32:08.861 --> 32:11.295
I do so love flowers.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.364
Tell the gardener to stop the
flowers.

32:40.526 --> 32:44.361
I sent for you because my aunt
would like to see you.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.463
Really?

32:46.465 --> 32:49.299
And what's made her change her
mind so suddenly?

32:51.503 --> 32:55.238
Perhaps because she's so old.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.875
People often become capricious
when they get so old.

32:58.877 --> 33:01.311
This is certainly true.
However...

33:03.482 --> 33:05.949
have you repeated to her
what I told you the other night?

33:05.951 --> 33:09.186
If I had told her what you said,

33:09.188 --> 33:11.421
do you think that she'd want to
see you?

33:26.372 --> 33:28.638
Miss Bordereau,

33:28.640 --> 33:31.908
it's a great pleasure for me
to see you again at last.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.911
I trust you are in good health,
despite the hot weather.

33:34.913 --> 33:39.149
I'm always cold. The hot weather
makes no difference.

33:39.151 --> 33:43.020
But my health
is good enough, good enough...

33:43.022 --> 33:45.489
It's a great thing to be alive.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.290
It depends on what you compare
it with.

33:47.292 --> 33:49.292
I don't compare.

33:49.294 --> 33:54.464
If I did that I should have
given up living long ago.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.704
About the flowers.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.242
I ought to have thanked you
before.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.411
But...

34:09.047 --> 34:11.114
I don't write letters.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.683
I'm delighted you enjoyed them.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.385
I shall send some more this
evening.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.853
What else should you do with
them?

34:17.856 --> 34:19.623
Hm?

34:19.625 --> 34:24.027
It's not a manly taste
to make a bower of your room.

34:24.029 --> 34:26.530
Why don't you come
into the garden yourself?

34:26.532 --> 34:28.799
You can pick what flowers you
like.

34:28.801 --> 34:32.768
Wouldn't it do you good to sit
in the shade, in the sweet air?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.012
Oh, my dear sir...

34:44.349 --> 34:49.286
If I move from this,
it won't be to sit outside,

34:49.288 --> 34:52.856
and then the air
that may be stirring around me

34:52.858 --> 34:55.625
won't be particularly sweet.

34:58.897 --> 35:02.199
It will be a very dark shade
indeed.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.837
I'm not afraid of what lies
ahead.

35:06.839 --> 35:10.273
But it will not be soon, I
suppose.

35:15.047 --> 35:17.047
Why don't you make her go out?

35:17.816 --> 35:20.383
Aunt, please.

35:20.385 --> 35:23.386
Do you pity her?

35:23.388 --> 35:27.157
Do you teach her to pity
herself?

35:27.159 --> 35:31.661
She has a much easier life than
I did when I was her age.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.230
Miss Bordereau.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.532
What you say seems to me
perhaps...

35:36.668 --> 35:38.001
a little unkind.

35:38.003 --> 35:39.102
Unkind?

35:40.339 --> 35:43.373
Perhaps you mean "inhuman"?

35:43.375 --> 35:48.812
That's what the poets used to
call women a hundred years ago.

35:48.814 --> 35:51.515
"Inhuman".

35:51.517 --> 35:54.484
Don't try to imitate them.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.586
You could never do as well.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.726
There is no more poetry in the
world.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.962
At least not around me.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.499
But I won't bandy words with
you.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.835
Well, then.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.371
I won't impose any longer
upon your kindness.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.640
Kindness?
I don't have to be kind to you.

36:16.642 --> 36:19.543
I don't have to be kind
to anyone any more.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.412
Thank God.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.880
Sit.

36:26.018 --> 36:29.452
Why don't you make that girl
go out and see the place?

36:29.454 --> 36:32.656
Dear Aunt,
what do you want to do with me?

36:32.658 --> 36:34.357
I... I know the place.

36:34.359 --> 36:39.629
He can show you the famous
sunsets, if they go on.

36:39.631 --> 36:40.730
Do they still go on?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.867
Hm.

36:43.869 --> 36:47.804
Take her to San Giovanni
Evangelista.

36:47.806 --> 36:52.409
Take her to the Piazza.
It was so pleasant in my time.

36:52.411 --> 36:57.314
Let her listen to the music,
let her look at the shops.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.785
She can have some money.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.353
She may buy...

37:04.623 --> 37:07.090
something she likes.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.368
I would be honoured
to accompany Miss Tina.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.704
And if she'd rather go alone,

37:20.706 --> 37:24.374
my gondolier is entirely at her
service.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.876
Shall I have the pleasure
of seeing you again soon?

37:26.878 --> 37:29.479
Is it very necessary to your
happiness?

37:30.716 --> 37:33.383
It diverts me more than I can
say.

37:33.385 --> 37:36.152
You're full of flattery.

37:36.154 --> 37:39.990
Don't you know
this talk almost kills me?

37:39.992 --> 37:41.891
Now, how can that be

37:41.893 --> 37:44.561
when you are more animated,

37:44.563 --> 37:46.129
more brilliant

37:46.131 --> 37:47.731
than when I first came in?

37:47.733 --> 37:49.733
It's quite true, Aunt.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.835
I... I think it does you good.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.803
Isn't it touching,

37:53.805 --> 37:58.708
the solicitude we each have that
the other may enjoy herself?

37:58.710 --> 38:00.877
If you think me brilliant today,

38:00.879 --> 38:05.448
then you have never met
an agreeable woman.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.018
Don't try to pay me any
compliments.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.920
I have been spoiled in this
respect.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.251
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

38:48.126 --> 38:50.493
<i>It was a splendid
afternoon.</i>

38:50.495 --> 38:53.797
<i>I saw that she enjoyed it
even more than she showed.</i>

38:53.799 --> 38:57.033
<i>She was agitated with the
multitude of her impressions.</i>

38:57.035 --> 38:59.135
It was so...

38:59.137 --> 39:01.871
<i> She had forgotten what
an attractive thing the world is.</i>

39:01.873 --> 39:03.473
I did think that...

39:03.475 --> 39:05.408
<i>And it was coming over
her</i>

39:05.410 --> 39:08.912
<i>that somehow she had, for the
best years of her life,</i>

39:08.914 --> 39:11.481
<i>been cheated of it.</i>

39:11.483 --> 39:13.483
<i>This did not make her angry,</i>

39:13.485 --> 39:17.687
<i>but her face had, in spite of
its smile of appreciation,</i>

39:17.689 --> 39:23.326
<i>the flush of a sort of wounded
surprise.</i>

39:23.328 --> 39:26.329
<i>As if she were thinking
with a secret sadness</i>

39:26.331 --> 39:29.566
<i>of opportunities, forever
lost.</i>

39:29.568 --> 39:33.203
I've found out what's the matter
with my aunt.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.205
She's afraid that you'll go.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.075
I suppose you mean because of
the rent.

39:39.077 --> 39:43.113
Oh, yes, it is shameful
but she wants me to have more.

39:43.115 --> 39:46.549
- - How much does she
want you to have?

39:46.551 --> 39:49.619
She ought to fix the sum. Then I
could stay till it's all gone.

39:49.621 --> 39:54.524
No, that wouldn't please me,
you going to all that trouble.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.696
The other day...

39:59.698 --> 40:02.799
I seemed to understand you might
help me with my search.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.901
Was I wrong?

40:04.903 --> 40:10.540
I... I couldn't do that
without being false to my aunt.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.843
She'd never consent to what you
want.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.645
She'd been asked before.

40:17.516 --> 40:21.251
So she does have documents...
papers of value.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.722
She has everything.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.359
She has everything.

40:33.732 --> 40:36.866
<i> There clung to her name
some scent of a reckless passion,</i>

40:38.069 --> 40:40.970
<i>an intimation that, for some
people,</i>

40:40.972 --> 40:44.841
<i>Juliana hadn't always acted
respectably.</i>

42:01.286 --> 42:02.919
You play beautifully.

42:05.724 --> 42:07.724
I haven't practised in ages.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.392
You should resume.

42:10.896 --> 42:13.696
It's the only piece I know.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.832
It's my aunt's favourite one,

42:15.834 --> 42:18.401
though I've never played it
well enough for her.

42:20.405 --> 42:21.871
Um...

42:23.308 --> 42:26.276
I want to thank you. For today.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.481
It was my pleasure.

42:31.483 --> 42:35.285
And for my aunt as well,
though she'll never say it.

42:35.287 --> 42:38.454
She doesn't often reveal
her true thoughts.

42:40.325 --> 42:43.560
What has made her this way?

42:43.562 --> 42:47.830
I don't know, it was on account
of something...

42:47.832 --> 42:50.967
years ago, before I was born.

42:52.137 --> 42:53.870
Something?

42:53.872 --> 42:55.605
What kind of something?

42:57.008 --> 43:00.476
She never told me.

43:00.478 --> 43:04.013
Do you suppose it's something to which
Aspern references in his letters?

43:04.015 --> 43:06.015
I've never read them.

43:06.017 --> 43:09.085
But I did see them once
when she had them out.

43:10.655 --> 43:12.555
Are they letters?

43:12.557 --> 43:14.891
Are they poems?

43:14.893 --> 43:16.292
Does she look at them often?

43:16.995 --> 43:19.295
She used to.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.064
She's very fond of them.

43:21.066 --> 43:22.732
Even though they may be
compromising?

43:23.702 --> 43:25.368
Compromising?

43:25.370 --> 43:28.871
Well, they may contain
some painful memories.

43:30.642 --> 43:33.042
I don't think that they're
painful in that way.

43:34.479 --> 43:37.513
You don't think
they may affect her reputation?

43:37.515 --> 43:39.482
Do you think that she did
something bad?

43:39.484 --> 43:43.820
Well, things were different
then.

43:43.822 --> 43:47.690
The morals of our day
may judge her badly.

43:47.692 --> 43:52.795
If they were compromising,
why would she keep the papers?

43:52.797 --> 43:56.633
Why would she not just...
destroy them?

43:56.635 --> 43:59.202
Well, she might. Towards the
end.

44:00.205 --> 44:01.537
Don't say that.

44:01.539 --> 44:05.074
- You must prevent it.
- How?

44:05.076 --> 44:09.212
- You could get them away from her.
- And give them to you?

44:09.214 --> 44:12.348
Well, you might just
let me look at them.

44:13.618 --> 44:17.286
They would be of such importance

44:17.288 --> 44:19.989
as a contribution to the history
of Jeffrey Aspern.

44:22.527 --> 44:25.128
There was a gentleman once

44:25.130 --> 44:28.865
that wrote to her
in very much those words.

44:28.867 --> 44:31.467
He said...
What was it? Let me remember.

44:31.469 --> 44:33.736
Ah! Yes...

44:33.738 --> 44:36.739
"They would be
of immeasurable importance."

44:40.512 --> 44:42.845
And what did she reply?

44:42.847 --> 44:45.715
After he'd sent her
two or three letters,

44:45.717 --> 44:49.118
she became fearfully angry.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.320
She tore them up.
She put them in the fire.

44:51.322 --> 44:53.056
Mm.

44:53.058 --> 44:55.258
She said that he was a devil.

44:57.195 --> 44:58.261
Well,

44:59.531 --> 45:01.197
I hope you won't see me as a
devil.

45:02.867 --> 45:05.535
It depends
what you ask me to do for you.

45:08.406 --> 45:12.575
I only ask that you prevent her
from destroying the papers.

45:13.678 --> 45:14.977
But how?

45:17.115 --> 45:19.982
It's she who controls me.

45:25.557 --> 45:28.591
I don't think that you have to
be too frightened.

45:31.563 --> 45:33.696
She... She loves them.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.300
She loves them so much.

45:49.948 --> 45:53.282
I'll do what I can to help you.

46:40.565 --> 46:43.199
"Destruction marks
thee!

46:43.201 --> 46:45.668
O'er the blood-stained heath

46:45.670 --> 46:48.304
is faintly borne

46:48.306 --> 46:51.641
that stifled wail of death.

46:51.643 --> 46:54.310
Millions to fight compelled,

46:54.312 --> 46:56.145
to fight or die

46:56.147 --> 47:01.117
in mangled heaps
on war's red altar lie."

47:15.733 --> 47:19.335
Tina is a very nice girl.

47:19.337 --> 47:23.706
I hope you did not take her out
because you were obliged to,

47:23.708 --> 47:27.210
but that you...
you have some feeling for her.

47:29.180 --> 47:30.413
Yes.

47:39.724 --> 47:41.524
Have you come to tell me

47:41.526 --> 47:45.094
that you wish to take your rooms
for six months more?

47:47.498 --> 47:50.399
I am a simple man of letters.

47:50.401 --> 47:52.401
I live from day to day.

47:52.403 --> 47:54.103
So do you find your rooms too
dear?

47:56.407 --> 47:59.508
I've treated myself
to three months in Venice.

47:59.510 --> 48:01.711
It has been an immense luxury.

48:01.713 --> 48:04.380
But if you find your rooms too
dear,

48:04.382 --> 48:08.517
you can have more rooms
for the same money.

48:08.519 --> 48:10.486
We can arrange something,

48:10.488 --> 48:12.688
we can <i> combinare</i>, as they say.

48:14.492 --> 48:17.193
Evidently you suppose me
much richer than I am.

48:17.195 --> 48:20.129
- You write books. Don't you sell them?
- A little.

48:21.065 --> 48:23.499
Not as much as I'd wish.

48:23.501 --> 48:26.402
Writing books such as mine
is the last road to fortune.

48:26.404 --> 48:29.639
Perhaps you don't choose good subjects.
What do you write about?

48:29.641 --> 48:32.375
I write about the books of other
people.

48:32.377 --> 48:35.278
I'm a critic, a biographer.

48:37.682 --> 48:41.317
What do you say about these
writers?

48:41.319 --> 48:44.754
I say they sometimes attach
themselves to very clever women.

48:46.624 --> 48:49.859
Do you think it's right
to rake up the past?

48:51.663 --> 48:54.897
How can we get to the past
if we don't dig a little?

48:54.899 --> 48:57.967
The present has such a rough way
of treading on it.

48:57.969 --> 49:00.703
I like the past. I don't like
critics.

49:00.705 --> 49:03.172
Neither do I.

49:03.174 --> 49:04.573
But I like their discoveries.

49:04.575 --> 49:06.208
Mostly lies.

49:06.210 --> 49:08.844
The lies are
what they sometimes discover.

49:08.846 --> 49:10.780
They lay bare the truth.

49:10.782 --> 49:14.116
The truth belongs to God,

49:17.221 --> 49:18.688
not to man.

49:18.690 --> 49:21.123
We'd best leave it alone.

49:21.125 --> 49:24.093
Who are we to judge? Who can
say?

49:28.499 --> 49:33.235
But if we stop trying, what
becomes of these great works?

49:33.237 --> 49:34.904
People forget them.

49:34.906 --> 49:37.173
We need the tools to measure
them by.

49:37.175 --> 49:39.408
"To measure them by."

49:42.146 --> 49:44.280
You speak like a tailor.

49:51.656 --> 49:54.490
What do you know about
curiosities?

49:54.492 --> 49:56.325
Curiosities?

49:56.327 --> 50:00.396
The gimcracks that
people pay so much for today.

50:00.398 --> 50:03.799
Do you know
what kind of price they bring?

50:03.801 --> 50:06.802
- Do you want to buy something?
- No. I want to sell.

50:08.406 --> 50:12.575
Do you know
what an antiquaire might give me

50:13.878 --> 50:15.244
for this?

50:31.162 --> 50:33.562
It's a very striking
face.

50:33.564 --> 50:36.632
Tell me. Who is it?

50:36.634 --> 50:39.068
A friend of mine.

50:39.070 --> 50:41.871
A very distinguished man.
He gave it to me.

50:43.574 --> 50:46.475
But you never mind his name.

50:46.477 --> 50:50.012
You would probably
never have heard of him.

50:50.014 --> 50:52.815
The young generation
know nothing of their elders.

50:52.817 --> 50:56.752
He was all the fashion
when I was young.

50:58.790 --> 51:00.089
The face looks familiar.

51:02.026 --> 51:06.695
You express doubt about this
generation knowing him but...

51:06.697 --> 51:11.567
he strikes me for all the world
as a celebrated man.

51:11.569 --> 51:15.237
Perhaps I've seen other
likenesses, other portraits.

51:15.239 --> 51:16.906
When he was older, perhaps.

51:19.310 --> 51:20.443
Who is he?

51:23.481 --> 51:25.214
I can't put a name on it.

51:25.216 --> 51:28.484
Only the person who knows who he
is

51:28.486 --> 51:31.387
would give me the price that I
ask.

51:32.290 --> 51:33.556
Then you have a price?

51:34.692 --> 51:36.759
I know the least I would take.

51:37.895 --> 51:41.263
I want to know the most I can
get.

51:42.667 --> 51:44.633
I should like to have it for
myself,

51:45.570 --> 51:47.403
but with your ideas,

51:47.405 --> 51:50.339
I could never afford it.

51:50.341 --> 51:53.342
You would buy the likeness
of someone you don't know

51:53.344 --> 51:55.778
by an artist who has no
reputation?

51:55.780 --> 51:58.013
The artist may have no
reputation,

51:58.015 --> 52:00.649
but that portrait
is painted wonderfully well.

52:00.651 --> 52:04.120
Oh, it's lucky you say that.

52:04.122 --> 52:05.788
The painter was my father.

52:05.790 --> 52:08.023
That makes it all the more
precious.

52:08.025 --> 52:10.559
I hope you'll tell me before you
offer it to anyone else

52:10.561 --> 52:12.394
and give me notice.

52:12.396 --> 52:14.230
I am a possible buyer.

52:14.232 --> 52:15.798
I want my money first.

52:15.800 --> 52:19.034
I have no doubt of that.
I know your ways.

52:19.036 --> 52:20.636
My ways?

52:20.638 --> 52:23.372
What do you know of my ways?

52:23.374 --> 52:25.141
Do you observe me,

52:25.143 --> 52:26.876
do you spy on me?

52:26.878 --> 52:31.614
You be careful, my friend,
because I observe you.

52:31.616 --> 52:36.452
You say you want to see me,
but I spy on you.

52:37.455 --> 52:39.555
I can see you.

52:39.557 --> 52:41.857
Do you make speeches to her?

52:41.859 --> 52:46.228
What do you talk about
when you go out together?

52:46.230 --> 52:49.131
You speak as if we were in the
habit of going out every night.

52:49.133 --> 52:50.866
Certainly I wish we had.

52:50.868 --> 52:52.568
But if that were the case,

52:52.570 --> 52:55.037
I'd feel greater scruple
at betraying her confidence.

52:55.039 --> 52:56.906
Her confidence. Oh!

52:56.908 --> 53:00.409
Oh, does she have confidence in
you now?

53:00.411 --> 53:04.513
Miss Tina,
do you have confidence in me?

53:04.515 --> 53:06.482
Your aunt so very much wants to
know.

53:06.484 --> 53:09.718
It's no good. She's dreadfully
excited.

53:09.720 --> 53:11.554
I see you, I see both of you.

53:11.556 --> 53:13.522
I see you from here.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.860
I dare say you think I'm ill.

53:17.862 --> 53:21.463
Oh, you think I'm losing my
mind, hm?

53:21.465 --> 53:24.833
You may like to think so.

53:24.835 --> 53:28.337
That is not the case,
that is not the case.

53:28.339 --> 53:29.805
I'm not ill.

53:46.791 --> 53:49.525
<i>At this moment,
in the stillness,</i>

53:49.527 --> 53:52.294
<i>after the long contradiction of
the day,</i>

53:52.296 --> 53:55.531
<i>Miss Bordereau's secrets
were in the air,</i>

53:55.533 --> 53:58.801
<i>the wonder of her survival
more palpable.</i>

54:28.699 --> 54:30.899
<i> I ask for your pardon.</i>

54:30.901 --> 54:33.636
<i>Not to leave you now,
but to have stayed so long.</i>

54:49.453 --> 54:50.886
You must go now.

55:29.060 --> 55:31.727
- Hm. Very elegant.
- Thank you.

55:31.729 --> 55:33.629
- Thank you, sir.
- Mm-hm.

55:41.472 --> 55:44.373
<i>All living creatures
have a spirit double.</i>

55:44.375 --> 55:46.375
<i>A doppelganger</i>

55:46.377 --> 55:49.378
<i>who is invisible but identical
to the living individual.</i>

55:51.215 --> 55:54.450
<i>Sometimes they are described
as the spiritual opposite,</i>

55:54.452 --> 55:57.019
<i>or negative,
of their human counterparts.</i>

56:18.709 --> 56:20.275
Drop it.

56:24.615 --> 56:25.714
Good boy.

56:33.824 --> 56:37.059
She's very ill.

56:37.061 --> 56:39.161
She's having great trouble
breathing.

56:39.163 --> 56:41.697
I... I thought that she was
dying.

56:41.699 --> 56:43.665
Don't say that.

56:43.667 --> 56:46.034
I didn't know what to do. I sent
the maid to get the doctor.

56:46.036 --> 56:48.170
I couldn't find you anywhere.

56:48.172 --> 56:49.705
I am sorry.

56:53.677 --> 56:55.811
I must go back to her.

56:55.813 --> 56:59.581
- May I help you in watching over her?
- No.

57:00.317 --> 57:01.550
No.

57:03.020 --> 57:06.088
She ought to be spared the sight
of you.

58:22.666 --> 58:25.467
She's calmer. She's sleeping.

58:25.469 --> 58:26.802
May I see her?

58:42.720 --> 58:46.455
She kept the papers... over
there.

58:48.492 --> 58:50.259
In that trunk?

58:51.629 --> 58:53.362
Where are they now?

59:34.338 --> 59:37.706
That green box, the one you
pointed out to me in her room.

59:40.311 --> 59:43.445
You said the papers had been
there.

59:43.447 --> 59:46.214
You implied
that she had transferred them.

59:46.216 --> 59:48.116
They're not in the trunk.

59:48.118 --> 59:52.120
I have looked. I have looked for
you.

59:52.122 --> 59:57.125
Would you have given them to me
if you had found them?

59:57.127 --> 59:59.795
I don't know what I would or
wouldn't have done.

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:04.466
I must tell you the truth.

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:06.134
The truth?

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.704
Yes.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.407
A confession, if you will.

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:18.847
I sailed under false colours.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:21.016
I gave you an invented name.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.019
Why?

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:25.454
I had to.

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:29.524
There.

01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:31.793
See for yourself.

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:44.773
I feel that you're a new person
now,

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.676
with a new name.

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:49.311
It's not a new one.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:52.414
Just a very good old one. Thank
God.

01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:54.683
I like it better.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:07.162
Do you think me a devil,

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.764
as your aunt says?

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:13.869
I think that you want
the papers very much.

01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:17.339
I do.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.607
Then be patient.

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:21.710
All is still possible.

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:27.949
You must do as you wish.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:21.236
Perhaps he's married already.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.705
That could be the reason
why he doesn't look at you.

01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:26.708
Give a man a mask
and he'll tell you the truth.

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:34.049
- Are you married?
- No.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:37.285
I walk alone.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:41.656
Doesn't it make you sad
to live your life without love?

01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:43.692
No.

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:46.528
I have my work.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:49.431
But I wouldn't expect ladies
of your youth to understand.

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:55.303
I am the Princesse de Lamballe,
Marie Antoinette's closest friend.

01:02:57.574 --> 01:03:00.942
That was just the
jealous gossip of people at court.

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:02.844
My head has just been cut off...

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.214
Morton!

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:09.117
Morton, where are you?
The princess is speaking to you.

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:12.687
Oh, he's still thinking
about those dusty papers. Come.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:15.590
What is there to find?

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:20.061
The truth.

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:22.931
The truth? About what?

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:25.267
About myself.

01:03:26.737 --> 01:03:29.204
About... desire.

01:03:31.742 --> 01:03:33.241
About God.

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:56.124
There are things
that must stay in the past.

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:53.782
You!

01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:55.784
Publishing scoundrel!

01:06:02.859 --> 01:06:04.826
Aunt... Olimpia!

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:07.529
Aunt... Olimpia!

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:08.930
Olimpia!

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.100
Aunt...

01:06:13.537 --> 01:06:15.136
Olimpia!

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:13.588
So, what are you gonna do now?

01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:16.191
Have you thought about it?

01:08:16.193 --> 01:08:19.560
I have but er... nothing's
settled yet.

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:23.465
What I was asking

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:27.635
is whether the reasons I took the
rooms in the first place still exist.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:29.037
Have you settled my fate?

01:08:30.173 --> 01:08:32.173
Your fate?

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:34.475
The Aspern papers.

01:08:34.478 --> 01:08:36.511
Well, there are a great many.

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:38.145
More than I supposed.

01:08:38.148 --> 01:08:40.180
When can I see them?

01:08:40.183 --> 01:08:43.718
I don't know that you can.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.453
You don't mean to say
you've made a deathbed promise?

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.656
Not a promise...

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:49.724
What is it, then?

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:55.863
She wanted to burn them

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.800
and charged me to do it.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:01.536
But I took them away and locked
them up.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.973
Did you say that you would burn
them?

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:08.143
No, I didn't. On purpose.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:10.377
On purpose to gratify me?

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.947
Yes, only for that.

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:18.786
I don't know what good that'll do
me now if you won't let me see them.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.854
I know. I know this.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:24.292
I don't understand.

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:27.028
If you didn't make a promise,
what can possibly tie you now?

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:30.698
Because... she hated
this.

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.502
She hated this so much.

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:38.072
She could be so jealous,

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:40.975
so covetous.

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.712
But there is the portrait.

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:47.215
You can have that.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.519
- You're giving it to me?
- Yes.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:54.722
It's worth a lot of money.

01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:56.191
Take it.

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:03.031
You're very generous.

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:04.732
So are you.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:06.367
I don't know why you should
think so.

01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:09.737
You've made a great difference
to me.

01:10:14.477 --> 01:10:16.010
As much as I value the portrait,

01:10:17.514 --> 01:10:20.114
the papers are what I should
prefer.

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:24.285
But you would understand
if you really knew her.

01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:27.622
I can still see her looking at
me.

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:31.893
Her eyes were so fine
but they could be terrible.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.062
I saw something of that.

01:10:34.064 --> 01:10:37.732
I could still see them
staring at me in the dark.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:41.336
You're very nervous.

01:10:41.338 --> 01:10:43.404
Yes. Yes, I am.

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:49.644
She wanted to say something to
me.

01:10:49.646 --> 01:10:52.714
Something very particular
before she died.

01:10:52.716 --> 01:10:54.382
Did you guess what it could have
been?

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:58.553
I think that she wanted to say
that...

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:00.688
if you were a relation,

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:02.857
things would be different.

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:07.462
A relation?

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:11.666
If you weren't a stranger,
what is mine would be yours.

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:15.436
You could do with it what you
want, I couldn't prevent you.

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:31.719
I will sell the portrait for
you.

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:34.656
It's what your aunt
would have wanted you to do.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:37.825
I shan't get what she demanded
for it

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.961
but I shall get something good.

01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:44.132
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

01:11:44.134 --> 01:11:45.933
I'm so ashamed.

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:51.572
I would give you everything.

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:53.341
Everything that you want.

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:55.443
And she would forgive me.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:13.314
<i>You will recognise
the handwriting of him</i>

01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:16.150
<i>who passionately loves you.</i>

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:19.020
<i>I feel your fiery hand touch
me,</i>

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:21.489
<i>take me where no other hand,</i>

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:24.125
<i>except my youthful and
intemperate one,</i>

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:27.428
<i>has ever gone in
with such a burning heat.</i>

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:48.850
<i>My destiny rests with you,</i>

01:14:48.852 --> 01:14:52.386
<i>and you are a woman
seventeen years of age...</i>

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:03.064
<i>But all this is too late.</i>

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:07.335
<i>Think of me sometimes when the
Alps and the oceans divide us,</i>

01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:10.872
<i>but they never will, unless you
wish it.</i>

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:30.358
<i>He was nearly my height,</i>

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.227
<i>very thin, very fair
complexion,</i>

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:35.963
<i>dark locks and light eyes.</i>

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.301
<i>His voice first attracted my
attention,</i>

01:15:40.303 --> 01:15:43.170
<i>but his countenance fixed it</i>

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:47.275
<i>and his manners
attached me to him forever.</i>

01:15:49.479 --> 01:15:53.881
<i>I love him more than I ever
loved a living thing,</i>

01:15:56.653 --> 01:16:01.589
<i>and he, I believe,
will love me to the last.</i>

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:23.177
<i>I rejoice that the child
is amiable and pretty.</i>

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.614
<i>She frowns and pouts in quite
our way.</i>

01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:30.785
<i>Blue eyes, light hair growing
darker daily...</i>

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:39.060
<i>My dearest Juliana.</i>

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:42.530
<i>To hear from afar
of our sweet child's death</i>

01:16:42.532 --> 01:16:45.433
<i>has shocked me more than any
preceding.</i>

01:16:46.502 --> 01:16:49.370
<i>It sits heavy on my heart</i>

01:16:49.372 --> 01:16:52.039
<i>and calls back what I wish to
forget</i>

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:54.442
<i>in many a feverish dream.</i>

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:09.056
<i> Our love broken.</i>

01:17:09.058 --> 01:17:11.659
<i>Myself, my own dread foe.</i>

01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:14.462
<i>I have been wandering
companionless with a joyless eye</i>

01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:18.566
<i>that finds no object
worth its constancy.</i>

01:17:18.568 --> 01:17:22.036
<i>Now, more than ever,
seems it rich to die,</i>

01:17:22.038 --> 01:17:24.972
<i>but I weary of this eternal
pilgrimage.</i>

01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:55.169
<i>I had scruples about
going back.</i>

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:58.506
<i>And yet I had others about not
doing so.</i>

01:17:58.508 --> 01:18:02.309
<i>Perhaps my absence would be
a heavier burden for Tina.</i>

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:31.372
<i>Il signor Morton.</i>

01:18:32.175 --> 01:18:33.374
Oh.

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:35.609
How pretty.

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:45.853
I was told you were...
Well, I was wondering...

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:48.322
Forgive me if I continue.

01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:50.825
I wouldn't want to impose.

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:52.927
Do you intend to stay in Venice?

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:56.063
I could stay.

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:57.732
It all depends on you.

01:18:57.734 --> 01:18:59.633
Oh, I'm leaving.

01:18:59.635 --> 01:19:01.335
You're leaving?

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:03.070
Yes.

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:06.474
I decided to go on a trip of my
own.

01:19:06.476 --> 01:19:09.276
Well, I could accompany you.

01:19:09.278 --> 01:19:11.612
It would be
a great pleasure for me if...

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:13.881
If only...

01:19:16.352 --> 01:19:19.854
I realised, you were right.

01:19:19.856 --> 01:19:24.458
The papers will seal our union.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.461
Oh, there's nothing that you can
do to get the papers now.

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:30.264
Why?

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:34.068
I burned them after you left.

01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:41.208
How could you do such a thing?

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:44.612
You should have waited for me.
You should have talked to me.

01:19:44.614 --> 01:19:47.081
It's what she
would have wanted me to do.

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:50.151
And what about me?

01:19:50.153 --> 01:19:52.620
Did you ever think of me?

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:54.755
I did.

01:19:58.795 --> 01:20:00.861
Shall I see you again?

01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:02.396
No.

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:05.633
You are inhuman, Miss Tina.

01:20:05.635 --> 01:20:08.335
Inhuman?

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:10.137
As my aunt told you,

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:13.507
that's what the poets
used to say a hundred years ago.

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:16.043
Don't try and imitate them,
you'll never do as well.

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:20.147
Look, I... I simply wanted to...

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:22.650
What we want doesn't matter.

01:20:22.652 --> 01:20:25.186
What matters is what we get.

01:20:25.188 --> 01:20:27.588
That's what she was trying to
tell me before she died.

01:20:29.792 --> 01:20:32.493
So that's what I'm to
understand?

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:35.863
One doesn't defend one's god.

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:38.933
One's god is in himself a
defence.

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:43.771
We must part now.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.307
We must.
