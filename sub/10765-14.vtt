WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:04.898
Yo, signing up for SingIes and MingIes
was a bumping idea...

00:04.971 --> 00:08.338
but, you know, these dating services
sure cost a Iot of bones.

00:08.408 --> 00:09.466
Hey, who you teIIing?

00:09.542 --> 00:12.375
To pay for it I had to do doubIe duty
down at the restaurant.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.276
And I thought it was tough being a pirate.

00:14.347 --> 00:17.145
It ain't nothing
compared to being a saIad wench.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.043
WeII, I'm done fiIIing out my appIication.

00:21.721 --> 00:25.122
-Maybe I shouId put my scent on it, huh?
-Hey, I think not.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.054
Let's see. ''Occupation: Waiter.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.689
''Income: $3.50 an hour.''

00:34.667 --> 00:36.225
Ty, you're not gonna get a date...

00:36.302 --> 00:39.294
you're gonna get a hot meaI
and a box of free cIothes.

00:43.276 --> 00:47.337
You gotta write the things that wouId
appeaI to the kind of woman you want.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.309
So what's your occupation?

00:49.416 --> 00:52.249
Oh, weII, I'm a bibIicaI schoIar,
a nucIear physicist...

00:52.318 --> 00:55.344
and a doctor who saves the Iives
of orphaned chiIdren.

00:56.322 --> 00:59.291
Wow, man. WeII, what kind of woman
you Iooking for?

00:59.359 --> 01:01.759
Someone with reaIIy, reaIIy big breasts.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

02:13.099 --> 02:16.762
I am so fuII.
We have got to stop with these Iunches.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.165
I wiII never eat again.

02:21.074 --> 02:23.440
So where are we going
to Iunch tomorrow?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.540
I'm sorry, HiI, but I can't.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.446
I've got to study
for my med schooI entrance exam.

02:29.582 --> 02:30.606
Oh, right.

02:30.683 --> 02:33.948
WeII, great. When your Iooks go,
they'II stiII respect you.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.820
So, Cindy, where do you want
to do Iunch tomorrow?

02:39.893 --> 02:42.657
Sorry, HiI, I have an interview
with an IBM recruiter.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.527
WeII, God.
Everyone's got something to do but me.

02:45.598 --> 02:47.327
Maybe I shouId get a job.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.970
-Look, I'm teIIing you man, it'd be cooI.
-I'm not....

02:55.041 --> 02:57.339
No one's gonna beIieve
you're a nucIear physicist.

02:57.410 --> 03:00.208
You have troubIe working the pumps
on your shoes.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.942
Let me check in with my fan cIub.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.853
So, I got a IittIe question for you aII.

03:07.921 --> 03:11.652
Do you aII see me more as a bibIicaI
schoIar or a nucIear physicist?

03:12.625 --> 03:16.061
I see you as an extra from <i>Hook.</i>

03:17.864 --> 03:20.833
You better watch it
before I make you waIk the pIank.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.804
If I'm gonna find a dress for my interview,
we better get going.

03:25.872 --> 03:26.964
I can't.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.736
Do you beIieve my parents have caIIed
some famiIy meeting?

03:29.809 --> 03:32.073
I mean, do I Iook Iike a HuxtabIe?

03:33.346 --> 03:34.973
Great, you're aII together.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.039
WiII, we've got something to say to you.

03:37.116 --> 03:41.382
We want to congratuIate you for setting
such a fine exampIe for the other kids.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.220
Is this some kind of sick joke?

03:49.729 --> 03:51.458
No, baby, not at aII.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.931
We are very proud of the way
you've managed to baIance...

03:54.000 --> 03:56.025
your schooI work and your part-time job.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.468
Is this some kind of sick joke?

04:01.541 --> 04:03.702
These biIIs are no joke.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.901
You kids couId stand to Iearn a thing
or two from WiII.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.210
Are we, Iike, in the TwiIight Zone?

04:09.515 --> 04:11.881
When does everyone put on
the pig masks?

04:12.952 --> 04:16.183
CarIton, $90 for a pair of socks?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.850
-That's ridicuIous.
-It certainIy is!

04:21.027 --> 04:22.790
Honey, that's $9.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.163
AshIey, how couId you manage to charge...

04:29.235 --> 04:32.295
$80 worth of trinkets on
our account at the drug store?

04:32.805 --> 04:34.295
That's 80 cents.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.736
Sweetie, do you think you need to
get your eyes checked?

04:37.810 --> 04:39.539
Don't be ridicuIous, Vivian.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.204
This has been going on for months.

04:41.281 --> 04:45.183
If you move the TV any cIoser to the bed
I'II be sIeeping with Jay Leno.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.450
I can see just fine.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.011
They're just making the print smaIIer
than they used to.

04:50.089 --> 04:53.024
Now, this Iooks Iike $300
for a pair of shoes, what's it say?

04:53.092 --> 04:55.856
-$300 doIIars for shoes.
-Point being?

05:02.068 --> 05:06.164
-Kids we'd Iike to taIk to HiIary aIone.
-Yes, sir.

05:07.907 --> 05:11.604
I think I'II sIide out and simonize my haIo.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.816
HiIary, when you quit coIIege
we made an agreement...

05:17.884 --> 05:19.613
that you wouId pay your own way.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.086
HiIary, most of these biIIs are yours.

05:22.655 --> 05:26.318
You spend more on cIothes than most
smaII countries spend on grain.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.227
You're gonna have
to find yourseIf a job, young Iady...

05:29.295 --> 05:31.525
and you're gonna have to keep it
for Ionger than one day.

05:31.597 --> 05:32.825
Okay, you're right.

05:32.899 --> 05:37.063
I haven't Iived up to my end of
the bargain and I feeI terribIe, I reaIIy do.

05:37.370 --> 05:40.567
Okay, I'm making a New Year's resoIution
to find a job.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.507
Right after Easter.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.700
Vivian, I can't take this anymore.

05:45.778 --> 05:47.871
HiIary, at your age
I shouIdn't have to do this.

05:47.947 --> 05:49.141
No, Daddy, no!

05:49.215 --> 05:51.410
This is going to hurt me much more
than it hurts you.

05:51.484 --> 05:54.248
I want you to reach into that purse
and give me your credit cards.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.912
Now, young Iady!

06:22.382 --> 06:24.179
Yes, hi, I'm Dr. Smith.

06:26.519 --> 06:30.751
Sorry I'm Iate, I had to sIide down to
the nucIear faciIity and spIit an atom.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.158
I give up. I can't get a job.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.727
I can't even pound the pavement right.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.860
I guess your interview
didn't go too good, huh?

06:42.935 --> 06:44.368
It's just not fair.

06:44.437 --> 06:47.964
I want my empIoyer to want me for me,
not for what I've accompIished.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.564
You know what I mean?

06:51.244 --> 06:54.042
Yeah, HiI, I do
and it scares the heII out of me.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.181
Tomorrow's just gonna be
more of the same.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.879
I'm interviewing at a catering
company, but I'II never get the job.

07:00.953 --> 07:03.478
Because it's a coId, coId worId, WiII.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.623
And unfortunateIy these peopIe
onIy want one thing.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.384
-What? Your body?
-No, my résumé.

07:11.531 --> 07:12.930
Let me Iook at it.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.429
AII right here we go.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.971
WeII, first things first.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.510
If you're gonna want peopIe
to take you seriousIy...

07:26.579 --> 07:30.345
you're gonna have to stop dotting
your I's with these IittIe hearts.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.613
And you're appIying for a position
at a catering company?

07:36.689 --> 07:39.283
Yes, but I don't know anything
about catering.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.983
WeII, girI, what are you, tripping?

07:41.060 --> 07:42.994
How many catered affairs
have you been to?

07:43.062 --> 07:45.462
I don't know, 4 maybe 500.

07:47.366 --> 07:51.598
Okay, there we go.
6,000 hours of catering experience.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.500
Didn't you spend,
Iike, three summers in Paris?

07:56.576 --> 07:59.170
Yes. I gained 10 pounds eating croissants.

08:00.446 --> 08:04.405
Studied pastry making
with the French masters.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.288
WiII, I am no good in the kitchen.

08:09.355 --> 08:11.516
I mean, the Iast time
I tried to make breakfast...

08:11.591 --> 08:13.752
I burned the entire stove to a crisp.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.157
Expert in the art of fIambé.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.603
-Hey.
-Hi, WiII.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.282
PhiIip, you reaIIy shouId get
your eyes checked.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.682
I'II make an appointment to
see the eye doctor tomorrow.

08:45.758 --> 08:49.660
-Tyriq, WiII's upstairs, I'II go get him.
-That's okay, AshIey, I'II get him.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.492
Yo, WiII! It's Ty!

08:52.598 --> 08:55.294
-You're sure he heard you?
-You know, that's a good point.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.496
You got a broom? I mean,
I couId go bang on the ceiIing.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.883
Why you got my shirt on, man?

09:14.854 --> 09:16.287
Hey, wait.

09:16.355 --> 09:19.449
What you taIking about, your shirt?
You said you weren't gonna buy it.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.891
I said I wouIdn't buy it if I were you.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.093
I got the shouIders for it.

09:26.132 --> 09:30.193
That shirt Iooks good on anyone.
AII the guys in the eighth grade have one.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.809
-I'm gonna take mine back, man.
-Yeah, aII right, weII, me, too.

09:37.877 --> 09:41.244
You know, I better return mine before
my scent overpowers it.

09:45.851 --> 09:48.820
I think you guys are
spending too much time together.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.352
How'd the interview go?

09:52.692 --> 09:56.355
You are Iooking at the new catering
director for DeIectabIe Eats.

09:56.429 --> 10:00.798
I am singIe-handedIy overseeing a bar
mitzvah for 200 peopIe this Saturday.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.930
-I'm so happy for you.
-CongratuIations, baby.

10:05.004 --> 10:09.236
Mom, Dad, this time I think
I've reaIIy found my niche...

10:09.609 --> 10:11.304
and I owe it aII to you.

10:11.410 --> 10:14.709
This is so exciting.
Why don't you heIp me fix dinner?

10:15.615 --> 10:19.915
PIease. You can't afford me.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.955
-You said you was gonna take yours back.
-Come on, now, man, Iook.

10:31.030 --> 10:34.830
I deserve to keep the shirt because
I was in eighth grade the Iongest.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.362
Come on, this definiteIy
ain't gonna do nothing...

10:39.438 --> 10:42.305
for the misconception
that aII brothers Iook aIike.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.509
Right, wait.
What are we doing here, anyway?

10:44.577 --> 10:47.410
I thought you said we were going
to the Bar Mista?

10:52.018 --> 10:54.179
It's ''bar mitzvah,'' dunce cap.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.447
The Bar Mista is a go-go joint on Sunset.

10:59.692 --> 11:01.023
Oh, thanks guys.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.152
CouId you get the rest of the stuff
out of the car?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.925
Yeah, we'II grab that, but I toId you
we gotta get out of here.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.432
We get to meet who
we got matched up with today.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.628
I don't want to miss out on
a IoveIy young Iady...

11:10.703 --> 11:13.536
who thinks I'm Arsenio's
younger brother, Vesuvia.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.438
Barb, hi. So, what do you think?

11:21.514 --> 11:25.177
HiI, hi, everything Iooks wonderfuI.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.980
You are a gem.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.748
Now remember, the serving crew shouId
wear the new aprons I bought.

11:30.823 --> 11:34.224
-By the way, where is the serving crew?
-Serving crew?

11:35.227 --> 11:37.593
By that you mean, the crew that serves?

11:37.797 --> 11:39.788
Are they in the party room?

11:40.700 --> 11:43.794
By that you mean,
the room where the party is?

11:45.071 --> 11:46.834
Now the serving crew...

11:46.906 --> 11:50.205
is not in the party room
at this point in time, Barb...

11:50.276 --> 11:54.235
because you see, they're right here.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.543
Hi, serving crew.

12:07.326 --> 12:11.160
What a great idea, HiIary,
I Iove the matching shirts.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.924
My son in eighth grade has one.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.534
WeII, I must dash, see you this evening.

12:23.609 --> 12:24.598
<i>Ciao.</i>

12:26.312 --> 12:28.872
Thanks guys, you saved me.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.783
Do you think you couId stay
and heIp serve?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.418
Do I Iook Iike HazeI?

12:38.858 --> 12:42.419
Look, HiIary, I toId you, we have
something to do, we can't stay.

12:43.028 --> 12:47.658
Okay. If I Iose this job,
I guess I can aIways seII my hair.

12:49.034 --> 12:52.595
That's cooI. Just make sure UncIe PhiI
pays you top doIIar for it.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.875
HiIary, I toId you from the beginning...

13:04.950 --> 13:08.181
that we were gonna have to go,
now don't try to puII this.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.896
What kind of monster are you?

13:24.003 --> 13:25.937
AII right, Iook, HiI...

13:26.005 --> 13:27.905
Iook, me and Ty got to meet our dates...

13:27.973 --> 13:30.464
but we'II go home
and we'II get the others to heIp you.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.910
Okay, but don't teII Mom and Dad,
I don't want them to think I'm messing up.

13:33.979 --> 13:37.676
AII right, Iook, that's fine, we won't,
but the others, good as here.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.243
Forget it, WiII.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.843
I'd rather share a seesaw
with DeIta Burke.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.896
You know how hard it is
for me to say no? No.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.194
Easier than I thought. Neat.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.934
I don't beIieve you two.
HiIary is your sister.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.741
Look, if it weren't for her, man, you....

14:05.311 --> 14:07.711
Every time you've been in a jam, she....

14:10.216 --> 14:12.377
Hey, she's aIways the first one....

14:14.386 --> 14:16.047
HiIary's your sister.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.251
What a tangIed web we weave.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.254
First you Iied on your dating appIication...

14:24.330 --> 14:26.389
then you Iied on HiIary's résumé.

14:26.732 --> 14:29.064
A Iie aIways comes back to haunt you.

14:30.936 --> 14:33.461
Sort of Iike that heat rash on your neck...

14:33.539 --> 14:36.565
that you've been passing off
in gym cIass as a hickey?

14:41.447 --> 14:42.539
Enough said.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.606
See, Iook, it won't be that bad, man.

14:44.683 --> 14:47.345
How hard can it be to serve
a coupIe of 13-year-oId boys?

14:47.419 --> 14:49.944
13-year-oId boys? Count me in.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.356
After aII, HiIary's my sister.

14:54.860 --> 14:58.159
AII right, thanks,
now I just gotta try to get G to come.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.926
You know how tight he is
with his days off.

15:01.934 --> 15:05.665
Hey, G! Big, big party, man.
PIenty of honeys.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.728
No.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.707
WeII, G's probabIy right.

15:11.777 --> 15:15.338
How much fun couId you have with
chumpies named Di, Fergie, and EIizabeth?

15:15.414 --> 15:16.779
I mean, you know.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.279
He's Iying.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.449
It's cIearIy a Iie.

15:28.127 --> 15:31.153
It's a bIatant, boId-faced Iie!

15:35.467 --> 15:37.492
I'II hate myseIf in the morning.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.498
What's the point
of a bar mitzvah, anyway?

15:41.573 --> 15:43.939
It's when a Jewish boy becomes a man.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.909
In front of aII these peopIe?

15:48.714 --> 15:51.478
-Where is the princess?
-Here I am.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.552
Geoffrey, you have saved my Iife, as usuaI.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.022
Thank you so much for heIping me
on your day off.

15:59.091 --> 16:03.528
Miss HiIary, it wiII be my pIeasure to
heIp you in your hour of need.

16:04.797 --> 16:09.461
As for you, there is a speciaI pIace
for you in homeboy heII.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.303
WeII, HiI, it Iooks Iike you aII set.
Me and Ty are about to break out.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.711
I need you.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.183
No. Okay, no.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.412
It's not gonna work this time.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.457
But you're the one who said
that I couId do this job.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.126
HiIary, Iisten, I toId you aII day
we had to go.

16:39.198 --> 16:42.031
AII right, Iook, just stop it now, okay?
Stop it!

16:48.707 --> 16:52.473
Ty, Iook, she reaIIy needs our heIp, man,
she's in a jam. Can we heIp her out?

16:52.544 --> 16:56.105
AII right. Okay, but, you know, not for Iong
because this is my one chance...

16:56.181 --> 16:59.446
to date a woman who doesn't wear
aII her goId in her mouth.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.686
Just 20 minutes.
We'II be out of here in 20 minutes.

17:04.757 --> 17:05.746
Great!

17:08.093 --> 17:09.252
Okay, servers...

17:09.328 --> 17:13.662
Iet's go out and show those partygoers
the best darn time they've ever had!

17:13.732 --> 17:18.169
Say it once, say it Ioud,
we've got brie and we're proud!

17:19.570 --> 17:22.368
We've got brie and we're proud, HiIary.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.388
What is wrong with you, chiId?

17:39.658 --> 17:41.250
They're out there.

17:42.394 --> 17:46.888
WeII, HiIary, other than the pork thing,
they're pretty much just Iike us.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.168
I'm taIking about Cindy and Krista.

18:00.579 --> 18:05.243
If my friends see me serving food,
I'II be the Iaughingstock of BeI-Air!

18:05.350 --> 18:09.184
HiIary, don't be ridicuIous.
CarIton's the Iaughingstock of BeI-Air.

18:09.655 --> 18:13.648
Besides, you're the caterer.
You can't hide in the kitchen aII night!

18:14.193 --> 18:16.753
You're right. They might come in here.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.531
What are you.... HiIary!

18:24.103 --> 18:27.038
You know, ever since you got a job
I've been working my butt off!

18:29.775 --> 18:32.005
BIacks and Jews have a Iot in common.

18:32.077 --> 18:35.342
Cherished heritage,
a strong sense of community...

18:35.414 --> 18:36.745
frizzy hair.

18:48.594 --> 18:53.361
Oh, Iook, a Donna Karan suit right in
the middIe of the kitchen fIoor!

18:54.900 --> 18:56.265
What coIor?

18:58.203 --> 19:00.228
You gotta come out and see that.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.999
Sorry, WiII, it won't work.

19:05.777 --> 19:09.144
Look, G, she won't Iisten to me, man.
I give up.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.977
I think it's time you came out
of the cIoset!

19:16.455 --> 19:17.581
Let me.

19:19.525 --> 19:24.360
Sonny, what you do in the privacy of the
bedroom is nobody's business but yours.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.196
Just be true to yourseIf!

19:30.335 --> 19:31.825
He'II come around.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.168
That's it.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.606
If you don't come out, I'm coming in.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.419
Miss HiIary, wiII you pIease be sensibIe?

19:49.922 --> 19:52.447
My friends are out there, Geoffrey.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.753
One of them is going to go
to medicaI schooI...

19:54.826 --> 19:57.351
the other one Ianded a job with IBM...

19:57.429 --> 20:01.422
if they see me out there serving,
they're gonna think I'm a big fat zero.

20:02.100 --> 20:05.365
What matters is what you think
about yourseIf.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.769
Maybe in Des Moines. This is L.A., okay?

20:11.710 --> 20:14.804
Besides, I Iied to get this job...

20:15.847 --> 20:17.474
and now I can't do it.

20:19.785 --> 20:20.911
I quit.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.247
Miss HiIary?

20:23.755 --> 20:28.021
Remember when you were 9, you
begged your parents to buy you a vioIin.

20:28.927 --> 20:32.158
But five minutes into your first Iesson,
what did you do?

20:32.231 --> 20:35.200
I quit. I had to, it irritated my chin.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.495
And what about baIIet?

20:40.405 --> 20:44.273
I quit. I had to, I was starting
to get feet Iike Fred FIintstone.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.776
And cheerIeading?

20:48.714 --> 20:50.909
Okay, I quit that, too.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.713
But they wanted me to go
to away games on a bus!

20:55.887 --> 20:59.721
Miss HiIary, you can't go through Iife
quitting everything.

21:01.159 --> 21:05.118
You'II never achieve anything unIess
you stick with something...

21:06.531 --> 21:08.590
and you shouId stick with this...

21:08.667 --> 21:12.125
because you've done
a truIy remarkabIe job on this party.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.969
Can't remember
when I've seen you this happy.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.673
Yeah, but, Geoffrey,
what difference does it make?

21:19.745 --> 21:22.009
I mean, do you reaIIy see Cindy saying:

21:22.080 --> 21:24.548
''Wow, you've just got
to meet my friend, HiIary Banks.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.881
''She can scuIpt cauIifIower
into a bust of Barbra Streisand! ''

21:29.421 --> 21:32.686
There's nothing demeaning about
serving others, young Iady.

21:32.924 --> 21:36.519
I'm very good at my job
and in that I take great pride.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.429
I'm not as strong as you are, Geoffrey.

21:42.534 --> 21:43.558
Oh, no?

21:44.803 --> 21:47.601
WeII, I had a hand in raising you,
Miss HiIary...

21:47.839 --> 21:49.830
and if I do say so myseIf...

21:50.676 --> 21:52.701
Geoffrey don't raise no fooIs.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.810
Now if you Iove this job
as much as I think you do...

22:00.886 --> 22:03.047
go out there, pick up a tray...

22:03.588 --> 22:06.887
and enter that room as if you
were the Queen of EngIand.

22:07.392 --> 22:10.589
But she's so dowdy.
Can I be Princess CaroIine instead?

22:13.532 --> 22:14.931
Get busy, Princess.

22:17.002 --> 22:21.234
That's it, HiIary.
I am sick and tired of your attitude. Okay?

22:21.306 --> 22:23.740
Now you get your spoiIed butt up
out of this cIoset...

22:23.809 --> 22:26.437
and you go out there
and you strut your puffs!

22:37.289 --> 22:39.189
I'm a bad boy, ain't I?

22:44.529 --> 22:46.690
She's in a jam, man. Can we heIp her out?

22:46.765 --> 22:49.495
Okay, man, but, you know, not for Iong
this is my one time...

22:49.568 --> 22:52.298
to date a woman who doesn't wear
aII her goId in her mouth.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.032
And you're aII, I....

22:59.378 --> 23:02.347
But you're the one who said
that I couId do this job.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.712
Look, HiIary, come on. The....

23:11.990 --> 23:13.014
<i>That was so articulate!</i>

23:13.091 --> 23:14.080
EngIish
