WEBVTT

00:33.381 --> 00:34.599
OH.

00:34.643 --> 00:37.211
SHIFU...YOU OK?

00:38.690 --> 00:40.823
MY MEMORIES FROM BEFORE
ARE RETURNING. HEH!

00:40.866 --> 00:44.261
MY BODY, IT IS
TAKING LONGER.

00:44.305 --> 00:47.264
WELL, YOU KNOW,
CONSIDERING--

00:47.308 --> 00:50.920
I WAS DEAD? MMM.

00:50.963 --> 00:54.924
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER, RIGHT,
SINCE YOU SMASHED THE PENDANT?

00:54.967 --> 00:56.926
I HAVE.

00:56.969 --> 01:00.321
I AM HOPEFUL IT SEVERED
XIAO'S CONNECTION TO ME.

01:00.364 --> 01:03.106
PERHAPS I AM MERELY
OUT OF PRACTICE.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.761
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

01:05.804 --> 01:07.763
YOU, ME
TRAINING AGAIN,

01:07.806 --> 01:09.765
ALMOST LIKE
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

01:09.808 --> 01:11.593
ONLY NOW,

01:11.636 --> 01:13.638
YOU ARE TEACHING ME.

01:15.075 --> 01:19.166
CHANGE IS INEVITABLE,
MY CHILD.

01:19.209 --> 01:21.168
TO MOVE FORWARD,

01:21.211 --> 01:23.387
CHANGE MUST BE EMBRACED

01:23.431 --> 01:27.696
IN ALL AREAS
OF ONE'S LIFE.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.613
YOU MEAN ROMANTICALLY?

01:33.310 --> 01:35.921
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
INTRODUCED YOU TO THE FAMILY.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.923
YOU CAN TELL ALTHEA
THAT JUST BECAUSE I

01:37.967 --> 01:40.839
HAVEN'T GIVEN HER
ANY NEWS ABOUT ME AND BO,

01:40.883 --> 01:43.015
I HAVE BEEN
EMBRACING CHANGE PLENTY.

01:43.059 --> 01:46.149
I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.719
SHIFU.
PEI-LING: HMM?

01:50.762 --> 01:52.721
THAT CHANGE THING.

01:52.764 --> 01:55.332
YOU SHOULD
TRY IT, TOO.

01:55.376 --> 01:58.335
OTHER THAN ONE FAMILY DINNER,
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT MUCH,

01:58.379 --> 02:02.992
AND I LOVE HAVING YOU BACK,
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST OUR SECOND CHANCE.

02:03.035 --> 02:05.081
IT'S YOURS, TOO.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.398
MEI-LI: LAO GONG?
OH.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.400
LAO GONG,
EVERYTHING OK?

02:19.443 --> 02:21.053
YEAH, ALL GOOD.

02:21.097 --> 02:23.055
BREAKER TRIPPED.
MEI-LI: OH.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.057
I THOUGHT THE HOUSE
WAS HAUNTED. HEH HEH!

02:25.101 --> 02:27.669
YEAH,
HAUNTED BY ALTHEA.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.671
HAVE YOU SEEN THE
STUFF SHE'S BEEN PLUGGING

02:29.714 --> 02:32.674
IN THE WALL EVERY
MORNING, JUST FOR HER HAIR?

02:32.717 --> 02:36.678
IT'S LIKE HIGH SCHOOL
ALL OVER AGAIN.

02:36.721 --> 02:39.289
I DON'T MIND.
AH, GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.944
MEI-LI: OH, SO YOU'RE

02:41.987 --> 02:44.555
NOT GONNA TAKE IT,
THE JOB OFFER?

02:44.599 --> 02:48.342
EH, ANTHONY'S A GOOD KID,
AND I'M FLATTERED.

02:48.385 --> 02:51.388
POLITICS?
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.869
LITTLE LATE TO JUMP
INTO THOSE WATERS.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.437
BESIDES, YOU GET IN,
IT CHANGES YOU.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.091
OR YOU CAN CHANGE IT.

02:59.135 --> 03:02.791
THE CITY NEEDS SOMEONE
LIKE YOU, LAO GONG.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.578
EVANN McINTOSH: ♪ I DON'T
REALLY MIND IF IT'S NOT... ♪

03:09.624 --> 03:11.582

03:43.310 --> 03:45.268
YOU GOT TO GET THAT?

03:45.312 --> 03:48.576
ONLY TO PUT IT
ON SILENT.

03:51.274 --> 03:54.930
ACTUALLY, I, UM, I
HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

03:56.453 --> 03:59.848
HEY, EVAN, WHAT'S UP?

03:59.891 --> 04:02.154
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM AN OLD FBI CONTACT.

04:02.198 --> 04:04.156
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE--

04:04.200 --> 04:07.159
HENRY.
WHY?

04:07.203 --> 04:10.162
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, DETAILS ARE FUZZY,

04:10.206 --> 04:13.165
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE HENRY
BROKE INTO A MUSEUM IN ICELAND.

04:13.209 --> 04:15.211
SOMEONE ENDED UP DEAD.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.213
TH--THEY THINK HE
KILLED SOMEONE?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.476
INTERPOL'S DECLARED HENRY
A PERSON OF INTEREST.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.958
THE FBI HAS BEEN TASKED WITH TRACKING HIM DOWN.
THEY WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.972
NICKY,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

04:58.472 --> 05:01.170
COME ON.
JUST UP AHEAD.

05:03.477 --> 05:07.176
WELCOME TO
OUR HUMBLE ABODE.

05:17.491 --> 05:20.102
WHERE IS SUYIN?

05:20.145 --> 05:23.018
THE HARVESTER
GOT HER.

05:25.237 --> 05:27.762
WHO IS SHE?

05:27.805 --> 05:30.417
THIS IS ZHILAN.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.944
SHE'S WITH US NOW.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.134
IS THIS EVERYONE?

05:52.177 --> 05:54.179
SOMEONE YOU'RE
HOPING TO SEE?

05:56.617 --> 05:58.793
SEEMS LIKE WE WERE
SCATTERED TO EVERY CORNER

05:58.836 --> 06:01.230
OF WHATEVER THIS PLACE IS.

06:01.273 --> 06:04.059
I'M GUESSING THERE ARE
STILL OTHERS OUT THERE.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.542
WHAT IS THIS?

06:08.585 --> 06:10.761
THAT'S A MEMORIAL,

06:10.805 --> 06:12.763
THE NAMES
OF ALL THE SPIRITS

06:12.807 --> 06:14.852
THE HARVESTER
HAS TAKEN.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.423
ZHANG FANG-SU.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.034
WAS SHE...

06:23.078 --> 06:25.080
MY MOTHER.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.650
I'M SORRY.

06:29.693 --> 06:32.566
SHE WAS PART OF OUR CAMP.

06:32.609 --> 06:35.525
SHE WAS ONE
OF THE FIRST TO FALL.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.875
SHE TALKED ABOUT YOU,

06:37.919 --> 06:40.182
SAID SHE WAS LOOKING
FOR HER DAUGHTER.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.669
WASN'T ME SHE WAS
LOOKING FOR.

06:50.192 --> 06:53.151
AND YOU HAVE HAD
NO CONTACT SINCE?

06:53.195 --> 06:55.240
NO.

07:00.463 --> 07:03.248
SORRY.
I-- THAT'S A LITTLE HARD TO BELIEVE.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.425
YOU WERE DATING
MR. YAN FOR OVER A YEAR.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.427
NOW YOU'RE LIVING
IN HIS APARTMENT

07:07.470 --> 07:09.429
AND WORKING
AT HIS OLD JOB,

07:09.472 --> 07:11.953
AND YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
A WORD FROM HIM IN MONTHS?

07:11.996 --> 07:13.955
IT'S THE TRUTH.

07:13.998 --> 07:16.392
IT--IT WASN'T
A GREAT BREAKUP,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.394
BUT HE'S
A GOOD PERSON.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.005
IF HE'S IN TROUBLE,
I WANT TO HELP.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.616
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN TELL ME?

07:22.659 --> 07:24.487
WE JUST WANT TO ASK HIM
SOME QUESTIONS.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.490
AH! YEAH, THIS IS BAD,
LIKE, REALLY BAD.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.492
I MEAN, DO WE KNOW
ANYTHING ELSE

07:29.536 --> 07:31.494
ABOUT HENRY
AND THIS MURDER?

07:31.538 --> 07:33.670
NO, AGENT WAS A BRICK WALL.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.672
I MEAN, THERE'S GOT TO
BE SOMETHING WE COULD DO, RIGHT?

07:35.716 --> 07:37.674
IF I
WASN'T IN INTERNET JAIL,

07:37.718 --> 07:39.371
I WOULD HAVE JUST HACKED
INTO THE AGENT'S TABLET

07:39.415 --> 07:41.373
AND PEEKED AT
THE CASE DETAILS.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.506
I'M SORRY.
OK, THIS WENT DOWN

07:43.550 --> 07:45.682
IN ICELAND.
WE PUT OUR FOCUS THERE.

07:45.726 --> 07:48.337
NO, LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND
INTERPOL COMBED THE COUNTRY.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.426
I THINK HENRY'S MOVED ON--
YOU THINK?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.428
HAVE YOU TRIED EVERYTHING
TO REACH HIM?! NICKY: YES.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.212
HAVE YOU CALLED,
TEXTED, EMAILED?! ALTHEA: RYAN--

07:54.256 --> 07:56.084
I DID.
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING!

07:56.127 --> 07:59.391
WHEN HENRY LEFT,
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE,

07:59.435 --> 08:01.916
EVEN REACHED OUT
TO THE WAN ZAI.

08:01.959 --> 08:05.528
HE'S COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED
FROM THE WORLD,

08:05.572 --> 08:07.269
FROM ME.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.533
UH...

08:10.577 --> 08:13.405
UH...I'M SORRY.

08:13.449 --> 08:16.017
IT'S JUST...

08:16.060 --> 08:18.323
IF ONE OF US WAS
IN TROUBLE,

08:18.367 --> 08:20.587
HENRY'D DROP
EVERYTHING TO HELP.

08:26.462 --> 08:29.596
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT CUTTING
OUR DATE SHORT THE OTHER NIGHT.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.468
NO, I GET IT.
YOU HAD TO HELP YOUR FRIEND OUT AGAIN.

08:32.512 --> 08:36.124
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
A DIFFERENT FRIEND THIS TIME.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.953
MY...EX-BOYFRIEND.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.563
OH.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.217
YEAH.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.828
IS THAT
A SERIOUS THING?

08:44.872 --> 08:47.483
YEAH. IT--IT WAS.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.487
UM, FOR WHAT IT'S
WORTH, WE'RE, LIKE, REALLY EXES,

08:51.531 --> 08:54.316
LIKE, "HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN 4 MONTHS" EXES.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.013
OK.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.451
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:59.495 --> 09:02.280
THERE WAS A MURDER
IN ICELAND,

09:02.324 --> 09:04.456
AND HENRY'S WANTED
FOR QUESTIONING. HE--

09:04.500 --> 09:06.589
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'LL BE WITH YOU SHORTLY.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.417
THANKS.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.986
I KNOW HE'S INNOCENT,
BUT HE'S IN TROUBLE.

09:12.029 --> 09:14.989
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND
HIM, AND ALTHEA'S GOT SOME IDEAS,

09:15.032 --> 09:18.166
BUT SHE'S OUTTA
COMMISSION TECH-WISE, SO...

09:18.209 --> 09:21.038
SO...YOU NEED MY HELP?

09:21.082 --> 09:23.606
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU CAN SAY NO.

09:23.650 --> 09:27.044
OK. UH, THIS WASN'T
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

09:28.524 --> 09:30.744
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

09:30.787 --> 09:34.748
I NEED YOU TO HACK
INTO AN FBI AGENT'S COMPUTER.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.491
OH.

09:48.979 --> 09:52.243
HEY.
ANY PROGRESS FINDING HENRY?

09:52.287 --> 09:55.159
UH, NOPE. NICKY SAYS
HE'S COMPLETELY UNREACHABLE.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.512
YOU LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING?

10:00.556 --> 10:03.907
MY EARBUDS.
THEY WERE RIGHT HERE. SEBASTIAN: NIGHTSTAND DRAWER.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.301
HAD TO MAKE SOME ROOM
FOR THE BREAKFAST SPREAD.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.477
KEEP THEM THERE SO I
ALWAYS KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.393
NOW YOU'LL ALWAYS KNOW
THEY'RE IN THE NIGHTSTAND?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.656
SORRY.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE SOME SPACE SO I

10:13.700 --> 10:15.832
CAN STOP TRIPPING
ALL OVER YOUR STUFF.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.834
'CAUSE I'M SUCH A SLOB?

10:17.878 --> 10:20.489
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
JUST BE NICE,

10:20.532 --> 10:24.885
YOU KNOW, TO HAVE SOME
ROOM TO ACTUALLY COOK IN HERE.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.887
ARE YOU OK?

10:28.497 --> 10:31.848
YEAH. IT'S JUST,
YOU KNOW, HOPELESS.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.590
MY PLACE IS TOO SMALL
FOR A CHEF'S KITCHEN.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.418
"YOUR PLACE"?

10:36.461 --> 10:38.289
HEH!

10:38.333 --> 10:41.379
FUNNY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS OURS.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.297
HEY.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.299
SEB, COME ON.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.611
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.787
YEAH, YEAH.
UM, SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER DAY.

10:57.831 --> 11:01.008
IT WAS JUST A LOT
TO PROCESS IN THE MOMENT,

11:01.051 --> 11:05.055
BUT I--I THINK I REMEMBER
SOME STUFF THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

11:05.099 --> 11:08.276
YEAH, THE DAY HENRY LEFT,
IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE, RIGHT?

11:08.319 --> 11:12.280
POWER HAD BEEN OUT, AND ALL
THE FOOD IN THE FRIDGE HAD SPOILED.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.893
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
JOTTING THIS DOWN?

11:16.937 --> 11:19.113
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
HEH!

11:19.156 --> 11:21.593
OK, GO AHEAD.
SO WE HAD NO IDEA

11:21.637 --> 11:23.204
WHAT WE WERE GONNA
EAT FOR BREAKFAST,

11:23.247 --> 11:25.293
AND I'M NOT MUCH
OF A COOK MYSELF,

11:25.336 --> 11:28.513
AND...THAT'S WHEN

11:28.557 --> 11:30.907
HENRY SAID
SOMETHING TO ME,

11:30.951 --> 11:32.909
AND IT WAS SO WEIRD,

11:32.953 --> 11:34.955
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.699
BAGELS.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.745
BAGELS?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.704
Bagels.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.315
THERE'S A SPOT
DOWN THE STREET,

11:47.358 --> 11:50.187
SO WE WENT
AND ATE THEM.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.276
BAGELS.

11:53.756 --> 11:56.716
THAT'S IT?
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:56.759 --> 12:00.023
WE NEVER EAT BAGELS.

12:00.067 --> 12:03.070
IS THAT HELPFUL?

12:03.113 --> 12:05.333
MS. SHEN,
NEXT TIME YOU CALL

12:05.376 --> 12:08.771
AN FBI AGENT, REALLY THINK
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S WORTH THEIR TIME.

12:10.468 --> 12:13.471
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:15.430 --> 12:17.388
BUY YOU ENOUGH TIME?

12:17.432 --> 12:20.087
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.657
EVERYTHING
THEY'VE GOT ON YOUR EX.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.721
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT!

12:45.765 --> 12:47.331
HENRY'S MOM:
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE HERE!

12:47.375 --> 12:49.769
YOU'VE BEEN GONE
FOR 6 WEEKS!

13:40.602 --> 13:42.560
HE'S A FAST ONE.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.562
WHAT IF HE
GETS AWAY AGAIN?

13:44.606 --> 13:46.564
WE'LL FIND HIM.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.697
I KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.441
ANY OF THIS USEFUL?

13:53.484 --> 13:55.225
JUST THAT HENRY ENTERED
WITH THE MURDER VICTIM, GRANT,

13:55.269 --> 13:58.228
BUT IT'S CLEAR FROM THE
VIDEO THEY WERE PARTNERS, NOT ENEMIES.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.448
FROM WHAT I'M READING, THE
FBI's THEORY IS THAT HENRY

14:00.491 --> 14:02.145
AND GRANT BROKE IN
TO STEAL SOMETHING--

14:02.189 --> 14:05.540
A RARE ARTIFACT CALLED
LAI-TAANG BOW-RAAN.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.498
THEY WANT HENRY FOR
QUESTIONING, BUT HE'S

14:07.542 --> 14:10.501
NOT THEIR LEAD SUSPECT.
WHO IS?

14:10.545 --> 14:13.026
CALVIN ZARCO--
SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL,

14:13.069 --> 14:16.029
KNOWN ANTIQUITIES THIEF,
A NOTORIOUSLY LETHAL ONE.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.074
ZARCO WAS SPOTTED
IN REYKJAVIÍK THE SAME DAY.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.642
SAFE BET THAT WASN'T
A COINCIDENCE.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.731
OK. OK, SO--

14:22.774 --> 14:25.342
SO HENRY AND GRANT
BROKE IN TOGETHER.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.736
WHAT IF THEY WERE ALL
AFTER THE SAME THING?

14:27.779 --> 14:31.174
ZARCO KILLS GRANT, BUT HENRY
GOT AWAY WITH THE ARTIFACT.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.915
YOU THINK ZARCO'S
STILL AFTER HENRY?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.656
EXPLAINS WHY HE HASN'T
REACHED OUT FOR HELP.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.876
HE'S RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE.
OK,

14:36.919 --> 14:38.878
WE DON'T HAVE ANY LEADS
ON HENRY'S LOCATION, BUT MAYBE

14:38.921 --> 14:41.489
WE SHOULD TRACK
ZARCO INSTEAD.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.143
CHASE THE CHASER. SMART.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.014
IF HE'S ANY GOOD, HE'LL
LEAD US RIGHT TO HENRY.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.668
AUTHORITIES ARE STUMPED.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.670
THEY'VE GOT NO IDEA
WHERE ZARCO IS.

14:48.713 --> 14:51.368
I MAY KNOW SOMEONE
WHO DOES.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.900
LOOK WHAT THE MONGOOSE
DRAGGED IN--

15:00.943 --> 15:03.685
MY OLD PAL, SHAOLIN.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.862
HEY, RAZOR.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.562
NO SYMPTOMS.

15:11.606 --> 15:14.870
MY MEMORY IS RETURNING,
MY SLEEP HAS IMPROVED.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.091
DID YOU FIND SOMETHING
IN MY BLOODWORK,

15:18.134 --> 15:22.095
SOMETHING UNUSUAL? RYAN: NO, NO.
ALL VERY NORMAL,

15:22.138 --> 15:25.098
UH, HUMAN.
NO SIGN OF, UM...

15:25.141 --> 15:26.360
XIAO.

15:28.405 --> 15:32.366
AS I SAID, I FEEL FINE,

15:32.409 --> 15:35.369
BUT NICKY THINKS
IT IS TIME

15:35.412 --> 15:38.981
FOR ME TO VENTURE
OUT INTO THE WORLD,

15:39.025 --> 15:42.985
EXPERIENCE LIFE AGAIN.

15:43.029 --> 15:46.162
DO YOU HAVE
ANY PLANS TODAY?

15:46.206 --> 15:49.165
ME? UH...NO,
NOTHING, ACTUALLY.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.820
UM, I'M-- PEI-LING: I
AM SURE YOU'RE VERY BUSY.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.910
YOU WOULD RATHER SPEND YOUR
DAY OFF WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

15:57.086 --> 16:00.133
YOU KNOW, SEB'S BUSY.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.354
I'M ALL YOURS.
WHERE SHOULD WE GO?

16:07.531 --> 16:09.446
HOW WE DOING THIS, SHAOLIN?

16:09.490 --> 16:12.449
I'VE BEEN TRAINING ALL MORNING;
NO NEED FOR A WARMUP.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.451
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW?

16:14.495 --> 16:16.453
I'M NOT HERE TO FIGHT.

16:16.497 --> 16:19.065
HEY, YOU PROMISED ME
A REMATCH.

16:19.108 --> 16:21.719
WHY ELSE
WOULD YOU BE HERE?

16:21.763 --> 16:24.287
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT CALVIN ZARCO?

16:24.331 --> 16:26.289
I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.291
HENRY NEEDS MY HELP.
I HEARD.

16:28.335 --> 16:31.294
ANTIQUITIES THEFT--
IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY.

16:31.338 --> 16:34.471
YOUR BOYFRIEND SURE
KICKED A HORNET'S NEST.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.082
EX-BOYFRIEND.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.735
EX, HUH?

16:37.779 --> 16:39.737
HEH HEH!
GOOD FOR YOU, THEN.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.826
THE SMART THING YOU CAN
DO IS FORGET ABOUT ALL THIS.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.655
I CAN'T.
LOOK, I LIKE THE KID,

16:44.699 --> 16:48.268
BUT ZARCO'S GOT RESOURCES, A
SMALL ARMY AT HIS FINGERTIPS.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.270
AND HE'S RUTHLESS.
HE'S NOT LIKE YOU AND ME.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.924
THE GUY HAS GOT NO...CODE.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.579
IF ZARCO WANTS HENRY,
HE'LL GET HIM.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.930
THAT'S WHY I NEED TO FIND ZARCO FIRST.
I THINK YOU CAN HELP ME.

16:58.974 --> 17:03.196
I DO, AND WORD GETS OUT...NO.
SORRY. NOT WORTH THE RISK.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.198
IS IT WORTH A REMATCH?

17:07.417 --> 17:10.377
A CHANCE
TO FINALLY BEAT ME?

17:10.420 --> 17:13.119
I WIN, YOU TELL ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT ZARCO.

17:13.162 --> 17:17.079
YOU WIN, YOU GET TO PROVE
OUR LAST FIGHT WAS A FLUKE.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.648
AND I GET A FAVOR.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.999
JOB COMES UP, ONE I
THINK YOU'D BE HANDY FOR...

17:24.043 --> 17:26.001
I'M THERE.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.701
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
EVERY DAY.

17:48.719 --> 17:51.679
AAH! HULVEY: ♪ WE
CHAMPIONS, THROW THE FLOWERS ♪

17:51.722 --> 17:55.074
I'VE BEEN
PRACTICING, TOO.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.559
NOW,
WHERE IS ZARCO?

18:05.214 --> 18:07.173
WHEW!

18:07.216 --> 18:09.827
WHOA!
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

18:09.871 --> 18:13.440
INVENTORY, FROM OUR BIG-BOX SUPPLIERS.
YOU KNOW--

18:13.483 --> 18:16.443
YOU KNOW, 25 YEARS
RUNNING THIS PLACE,

18:16.486 --> 18:19.446
WE HAVE NEVER ORDERED
ANYTHING BEYOND TWO WEEKS.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.448
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
PUT IT ALL?

18:21.491 --> 18:24.059
THAT'S WHAT MAMA WANTS
ME TO FIGURE OUT.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.106
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
OH, OH, ALTHEA?

18:27.149 --> 18:30.674
- HMM? - UH, YOU'RE
NOT DOING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?

18:30.718 --> 18:32.763
IF YOU'RE TEASING ME

18:32.807 --> 18:34.852
ABOUT NOT HAVING A JOB,
IT'S TOO SOON.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.985
PLUS, I'M ONLY GIVING
THIS TO MAMA.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.118
ONE FAVOR A DAY
IS PLENTY.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.816
NOT EVEN
FOR YOUR BABA?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.691
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.694
OH...PLEASE?

18:50.738 --> 18:54.698
LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.700
NOW, YOU'RE A WIZARD
AT THIS STUFF.

18:56.744 --> 18:59.312
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
I'M ONLY GOOD AT CODE.

18:59.355 --> 19:02.315
THESE ARE REAL BOXES
AND REAL SUPPLIES.

19:02.358 --> 19:05.405
I--I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO START.
TSK. HERE.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.844
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.288
HOW'D IT GO?

19:19.332 --> 19:22.161
TURNS OUT RAZOR'S GOT
A BUDDY ON ZARCO'S TEAM.

19:22.204 --> 19:25.381
THEY'RE HOT ON HENRY'S TRAIL,
LANDED IN BANGKOK THIS MORNING.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.470
I'M GUESSING THAT'S
WHERE YOU'RE HEADED.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.080
YEAH.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.082
CITY OF WHAT,
10 MILLION?

19:31.126 --> 19:33.172
YOU WANT
AN EXTRA SET OF EYES?

19:34.651 --> 19:37.219
I THINK I NEED TO HANDLE
THIS ONE ON MY OWN.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.265
PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.267
BO...

19:41.310 --> 19:43.921
I KNOW
HOW WEIRD THIS IS,

19:43.965 --> 19:46.185
THE EX OF IT ALL.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.839
THANK YOU,
FOR EVERYTHING.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.887
ANYTIME...

19:52.930 --> 19:55.498
BUT JUST TO BE SURE,

19:55.542 --> 19:58.153
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT, RIGHT?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.199
YOU AND HENRY?

20:01.678 --> 20:05.726
NO.
HENRY AND I ARE DONE.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.216
YOU MAKE
AN EXCELLENT TOUR GUIDE.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.609
NO, NO, NO,
YOU MAKE AN EXCELLENT TOURIST.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.829
YOU DID THE WHARF,
RODE THE TROLLEY,

20:21.872 --> 20:24.048
DRAGGED ME ALL THROUGH THE CASTRO.

20:24.092 --> 20:26.355
MOST FRIENDS WHO VISIT ONLY
WANT TO DO THE COOL STUFF.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.357
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I
TAKE THIS PLACE FOR GRANTED,

20:28.401 --> 20:30.533
BUT SEEING THIS CITY
THROUGH YOUR EYES...

20:30.577 --> 20:32.535
I HAD FUN.

20:32.579 --> 20:35.190
ALL RIGHT.
PEI-LING: MMM.

20:35.234 --> 20:39.803
SO WE HAVE
ONE STAR KREME CIDER...

20:39.847 --> 20:41.805
AND ONE PROHIBITION
ICED TEA.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.894
OH--OH, RYAN,
I DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.070
OH, NO, NO, IT'S A MOCKTAIL.
THANK YOU.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.159
MM-HMM.
NICKY'S FAVORITE--

20:48.203 --> 20:50.161
LOTS OF SUGAR,
ZERO ALCOHOL.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.604
SO, WHERE NEXT?

20:57.647 --> 20:59.606
I HAVE TAKEN ENOUGH
OF YOUR TIME--

20:59.649 --> 21:01.825
NO, NO, NO.
I'M FREE.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.263
YOUR SCHEDULE, PERHAPS,

21:04.306 --> 21:06.874
BUT I HAVE SEEN YOU
CHECKING YOUR PHONE.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.876
IS IT SEBASTIAN?

21:08.919 --> 21:11.531
IT'S THAT OBVIOUS?
PEI-LING: HMM.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.402
WE HAD A FIGHT.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.404
DID YOU APOLOGIZE?

21:15.448 --> 21:17.319
APOLOGIZE?

21:17.363 --> 21:19.365
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
WE'RE FIGHTING ABOUT.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.541
HE WAS THE ONE WHO
MOVED MY STUFF WITHOUT ASKING.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.109
IT'S BEEN HARD.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.111
HIS PLACE WAS TRASHED
IN THE EARTHQUAKE.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.113
WE HAD TO MOVE IN
TOGETHER PRETTY FAST.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.725
I FEEL LIKE I LOST
ALL MY SPACE OVERNIGHT,

21:31.768 --> 21:34.249
AND HE PROBABLY FEELS LIKE...

21:34.293 --> 21:36.643
I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ENOUGH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:36.686 --> 21:39.167
I SHOULD JUST APOLOGIZE,
LET HIM WIN.

21:44.128 --> 21:47.088
LOVE IS NOT
ABOUT WINNING

21:47.131 --> 21:49.220
OR LOSING, HMM?

21:50.657 --> 21:52.615
BUT I AGREE.

21:52.659 --> 21:56.489
AN APOLOGY IS
A GREAT PLACE TO START.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.969
NICKY WASN'T JOKING.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.537
YOU'RE GOOD.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.943
YOU SURE I'M
GOING THE RIGHT WAY?

22:15.986 --> 22:18.380
I'M TRACKING
ZARCO'S GUY IN REAL TIME.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.904
MY BUDDY AT DHS WAS ABLE TO
USE THE NUMBER YOU GOT FROM RAZOR.

22:20.948 --> 22:23.342
AM I GETTING WARMER? EVAN:
YEAH, THEY'RE JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

22:23.385 --> 22:26.170
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? NICKY: CATCH UP TO
ZARCO AND HIS MEN, SEE IF I CAN

22:26.214 --> 22:28.608
GET A LEAD ON HENRY.
WHOA, WAIT, WAIT. THEY'RE ON THE MOVE, FAST.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.871
WHERE? EVAN: UH, THEY'RE HEADING
INTO AN OPEN-AIR MARKET JUST AHEAD.

22:30.914 --> 22:33.047
GET TO THE END OF
THE ALLEY AND TAKE A RIGHT.

22:33.090 --> 22:35.658
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CUT THEM OFF.
OK, KEEP GOING, STRAIGHT.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.750
OK, GO LEFT.
ALL RIGHT, KEEP GOING.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.405
STRAIGHT...

22:43.449 --> 22:45.799
AND STOP, RIGHT THERE.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.543
NICKY?

22:50.586 --> 22:52.458
HEY.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.764
DUCK!

22:56.375 --> 22:59.987
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THOUGHT YOU COULD USE SOME HELP.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.820
WE GOTTA GO.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.223
NO SIGN OF ZARCO'S MEN.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.443
THINK WE LOST 'EM?
FOR NOW.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.141
THEY'VE BEEN ON MY HEELS
SINCE REYKJAVIÍK.

23:27.536 --> 23:30.496
WE SHOULD BE SAFE HERE,

23:30.539 --> 23:32.498
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

23:32.541 --> 23:35.414
YEAH, RAZOR SAYS ZARCO'S GOT
CONTACTS ALL OVER THE CITY.

23:36.893 --> 23:39.766
RAZOR?
THAT'S HOW YOU FOUND ME?

23:39.809 --> 23:42.856
HAD TO GET CREATIVE.

23:44.814 --> 23:47.469
HOW ARE YOU?

23:51.081 --> 23:53.432
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.921
SI NAN.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.317
YOU DID IT.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.014
HOW?

24:13.452 --> 24:16.019
DRIED GOODS, NONPERISHABLES, SAUCES.

24:16.063 --> 24:18.848
EVERYTHING IS LABELED AND STORED
SO THAT ANYONE CAN SEE

24:18.892 --> 24:20.850
WHAT NEEDS TO BE REPLENISHED.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.852
WAIT, I'M CONFUSED.

24:22.896 --> 24:25.464
THE SPICES, THEY'RE SCATTERED
ALL OVER THE KITCHEN.

24:25.507 --> 24:26.943
BY DESIGN.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.555
INGREDIENTS ARE NOW
STORED BY MENU ITEM,

24:29.598 --> 24:31.557
NOT INGREDIENT TYPE.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.211
EACH DISH GETS
ITS OWN OUTPOST.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.213
BUT WE USE
BLACK RICE VINEGAR

24:36.257 --> 24:38.694
IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT DISHES.
MM-HMM, AND THANKS

24:38.738 --> 24:42.176
TO OUR NEW PARTNERS, WE HAVE
ENOUGH INVENTORY TO COVER OUR REDUNDANCIES.

24:42.219 --> 24:44.178
WITH THE VOLUME WE'LL BE
DOING, THE PRODUCT WILL BE

24:44.221 --> 24:47.355
CONSUMED LONG
BEFORE THEY EXPIRE.

24:47.398 --> 24:50.184
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT
ALTHEA DID IN THE OFFICE.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.186
MEI-LI: OH.
OOH. SEE FOR YOURSELF.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.754
MEI-LI, CHUCKLING: OK.
HA HA HA!

24:57.757 --> 25:00.977
I COULD NEVER PULL THIS OFF.
HA HA!

25:01.021 --> 25:04.328
YOU KNOW, I'VE JUST BEEN
FEELING SO USELESS WITHOUT COMPUTERS,

25:04.372 --> 25:08.942
LIKE I'D NEVER BE GOOD AT ANYTHING
AGAIN, BUT TECH IS JUST A TOOL.

25:08.985 --> 25:13.163
I MISS INSTA DESPERATELY,
BUT, WELL, IT'S NICE

25:13.207 --> 25:16.689
KNOWING THAT I CAN
SOLVE PROBLEMS WITHOUT A SMARTPHONE.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.213
AH. OH. HO HO!
OH.

25:19.256 --> 25:22.564
I WAS NEW TO ALL
OF THIS, BUT I DID IT,

25:22.608 --> 25:26.568
SO THANK YOU FOR GETTING
ME OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.745
MEI-LI: AHEM.

25:29.789 --> 25:31.312
ALL RIGHT.

25:31.355 --> 25:32.835
DON'T SAY IT.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.402
SAY WHAT?

25:34.445 --> 25:36.796
I DON'T HAVE TO

25:36.839 --> 25:39.929
BECAUSE YOU ARE ALREADY
THINKING IT, LAO GONG.

25:39.973 --> 25:42.932
I FEEL LIKE I'M
MISSING SOMETHING.

25:42.976 --> 25:46.022
YOUR MOTHER THINKS
I AM LIMITING MYSELF.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.286
I'LL GIVE
ANTHONY CHAN A CALL.

25:49.330 --> 25:52.289
MEI-LI: YES!
ABOUT WHAT?

25:52.333 --> 25:54.727
GETTING OUT
OF MY COMFORT ZONE.

25:54.770 --> 25:57.381
SO THE COMPASS
REACTS TO YOU?

25:57.425 --> 26:00.602
YEAH.
WASN'T UNTIL I SAW IT UP CLOSE THAT I REMEMBERED

26:00.646 --> 26:03.387
I'D SEEN
THESE SYMBOLS BEFORE.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.389
WHEN I WAS A KID,
WHEN MY DAD WAS

26:05.433 --> 26:07.478
CLAIMING TO BE
AN ANTIQUITIES DEALER,

26:07.522 --> 26:10.133
HE BROUGHT AN OBJECT
HOME, SOMETHING CALLED THE LODESTONE.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.962
THE LODESTONE AND
THE COMPASS ARE CONNECTED,

26:13.006 --> 26:16.183
BOTH PARTS OF THE SAME MYTH.
WHAT DO THEY DO?

26:16.226 --> 26:18.315
FROM WHAT I'VE READ,
IF THEY'RE BROUGHT TOGETHER

26:18.359 --> 26:21.318
AT THIS SACRED SITE
CALLED THE FOUNDATION,

26:21.362 --> 26:24.713
IT ACTIVATES SOMETHING,
SOMETHING CALLED GENESIS.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.323
GENESIS?

26:26.367 --> 26:27.934
YEAH, NO IDEA
WHAT THAT IS.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.588
ALL THESE OBJECTS
WERE FORGED THOUSANDS

26:29.631 --> 26:31.328
OF YEARS AGO
BY A SECT OF MONKS,

26:31.372 --> 26:34.331
AND THE MYTHS THAT SPRUNG
UP IN THEIR WAKE ARE...

26:34.375 --> 26:37.073
VARIED, IMPERFECT.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.903
I'M--I'M SO CLOSE TO FIGURING
OUT WHAT MY DAD MEANT,

26:40.947 --> 26:43.906
TO THE SECRET
OF WHO I AM.

26:43.950 --> 26:46.561
THE LODESTONE WASN'T WITH
HIS THINGS WHEN HE DIED,

26:46.605 --> 26:49.564
AND FOR ALL I
KNOW, ZARCO HAS IT, BUT----

26:49.608 --> 26:51.566
IF--IF I COULD FIND
THE FOUNDATION,

26:51.610 --> 26:54.047
IT MIGHT GIVE ME A CLUE
AS TO WHAT'S NEXT.

26:54.090 --> 26:57.006
ACCORDING TO
MY DAD'S RESEARCH,

26:57.050 --> 26:59.661
THE FOUNDATION IS
SOMEWHERE HERE,

26:59.705 --> 27:01.707
IN THAILAND.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.190
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE,

27:07.234 --> 27:09.628
THAT I CAME HERE
TO SAVE YOU,

27:09.671 --> 27:11.542
BUT I GUESS

27:11.586 --> 27:13.632
THIS ISN'T OVER.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.819
YOUR MOTHER.

27:26.862 --> 27:29.909
DIDN'T KNOW HER LONG, BUT
SHE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD WOMAN.

27:33.869 --> 27:37.351
I ONLY MET HER ONCE,
IN THE REALM.

27:38.874 --> 27:41.834
WHEN SHE...LEARNED
WHAT I HAD DONE

27:41.877 --> 27:43.836
WITH MY LIFE,

27:43.879 --> 27:47.491
WHAT I HAD BECOME...

27:47.535 --> 27:50.190
SHE REJECTED ME.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.238
WHEN I SAW YOU
AND REALIZED

27:55.282 --> 27:57.850
THAT THERE WERE OTHER
GUARDIANS IN THIS PLACE,

27:57.893 --> 28:01.941
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
I COULD FIND HER...

28:03.551 --> 28:05.988
I'D HAVE
A SECOND CHANCE.

28:08.599 --> 28:12.560
YOU WERE...
HOPING FOR...

28:12.603 --> 28:14.649
REDEMPTION?

28:18.305 --> 28:21.264
SORRY, IT'S JUST...
YOU KILLED ME.

28:21.308 --> 28:24.703
AND FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD, I WASN'T
THE ONLY LIFE YOU TOOK BACK ON EARTH.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.705
WHAT YOU'VE HEARD?
OH, YEAH.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.707
EVERYONE IN THIS CAVE
KNOWS YOU'RE A MURDERER.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.317
IS THIS YOUR IDEA
OF A PEP TALK?

28:30.360 --> 28:32.319
LOOK, MY POINT IS...

28:34.364 --> 28:37.324
WE'RE ALL STUCK
ON THIS ROCK TOGETHER.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.935
WHAT YOU DID BACK
ON EARTH, IT--

28:39.979 --> 28:42.416
IT'S IN THE PAST.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.810
NOBODY CARES.

28:44.853 --> 28:47.813
IF YOU WANT
TO MAKE AMENDS,

28:47.856 --> 28:51.164
FOCUS ON WHAT
YOU CAN DO NOW.

28:59.128 --> 29:01.087
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:01.130 --> 29:03.437
JIA.
SHE'S GONE.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.831
WE WERE GATHERING SUPPLIES
BY THE TREE LINE.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.659
THE HARVESTER
CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.749
HE GOT HER.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.769
OH. HEH!

29:32.335 --> 29:35.382
PEI-LING.
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR RYAN?

29:36.862 --> 29:39.473
UH, ACTUALLY,
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

29:39.516 --> 29:43.085
OH, OF COURSE.
I--TAKE A SEAT.

29:47.481 --> 29:51.441
I--I NEVER IMAGINED I
WOULD HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY,

29:51.485 --> 29:54.053
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING

29:54.096 --> 29:56.795
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY TO YOU.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.495
I AM SORRY.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.497
SORRY?

30:03.540 --> 30:06.717
WHEN NICKY
CAME TO THE MONASTERY,

30:06.761 --> 30:09.982
I KNEW HOW WORRIED
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN,

30:10.025 --> 30:13.507
NOT KNOWING WHERE SHE WAS,
HOW SHE WAS DOING.

30:14.900 --> 30:18.512
I FELT I HAD TO RESPECT
NICKY'S CHOICE.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.644
I WAS TEMPTED
TO CALL YOU

30:20.688 --> 30:23.517
MANY TIMES.

30:23.560 --> 30:28.304
NOW THAT WE HAVE MET,
I MUST APOLOGIZE.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.350
OH, NO, NO.

30:30.393 --> 30:32.352
PEI-LING,

30:32.395 --> 30:35.442
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE SORRY FOR.

30:36.922 --> 30:40.273
WHEN YOU TOOK MY
DAUGHTER IN, SHE WAS LOST.

30:40.316 --> 30:43.102
I PUSHED HER AWAY

30:43.145 --> 30:45.756
AND AT A TIME
IN HER LIFE

30:45.800 --> 30:48.368
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO HELP HER,

30:48.411 --> 30:50.718
BUT YOU DID.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.070
AND WHEN SHE CAME HOME,

30:55.114 --> 30:57.072
SHE WAS TRANSFORMED.

30:58.769 --> 31:02.730
THE STRENGTH I SAW
IN HER AS A CHILD,

31:02.773 --> 31:04.863
IT HAD BLOSSOMED.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.039
AND SHE WAS...

31:07.082 --> 31:09.041
CONFIDENT,

31:09.084 --> 31:11.260
CARING,

31:11.304 --> 31:13.262
BRAVE,

31:13.306 --> 31:16.875
AND I KNEW SHE LEARNT
THAT FROM YOU.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.965
AND THAT CHANGE
IN HER?

31:20.008 --> 31:23.707
IT CHANGED
ALL OF US.

31:25.971 --> 31:29.844
I OWE YOU SO MUCH.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.464
PEI-LING?

31:42.944 --> 31:44.424
YOU.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.600
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.865
THE WARRIOR'S MOTHER.

31:55.826 --> 31:58.307
IT--IT--IT WAS NOT--

32:00.353 --> 32:02.529
I'M SORRY. SORRY.
MEI-LI: PEI-LING, WAIT.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.618
PEI-LING!

32:16.804 --> 32:18.371
ANYTHING?

32:18.414 --> 32:20.982
IT'S ALL IN THAI,
BUT FROM THE PICTURES,

32:21.026 --> 32:24.507
I'M GUESSING IT'S
MOSTLY ABOUT ANCIENT AGRICULTURE.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.076
HOW'S THE FAMILY?

32:29.686 --> 32:32.689
EVERYONE'S GOOD. YEAH.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.736
RYAN, THE BIG MAN
IN THE E.R.

32:35.779 --> 32:38.826
ALTHEA'S IN INTERNET
JAIL, BUT SHE'S COPING.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.220
RESTAURANT'S GOT
A CORPORATE SPONSOR NOW.

32:41.263 --> 32:43.222
AND...

32:43.265 --> 32:46.834
PEI-LING IS...ALIVE,

32:46.877 --> 32:48.836
LIVING WITH ME

32:48.879 --> 32:50.881
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

32:50.925 --> 32:52.013
PEI-LING?

32:52.057 --> 32:53.623
YEAH.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.191
LONG STORY.

32:56.235 --> 32:59.194
ACTUALLY,
A LOT HAS CHANGED.

32:59.238 --> 33:01.414
HOLD ON.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.209
IT'S THE LODESTONE.

33:14.253 --> 33:17.473
THE SAME ONE
FROM MY FATHER'S STUDY.

33:17.517 --> 33:19.910
WHAT IS THAT?

33:19.954 --> 33:22.087
IT WAS WRITTEN
ON THE LODESTONE.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.698
WELL, WE NEED SOMEONE
TO TRANSLATE IT.

33:24.741 --> 33:27.527
"THE COMPASS AND THE
LODESTONE WILL SUMMON GENESIS

33:27.570 --> 33:30.356
FROM THE FOUNDATION
AT THE CENTER OF THE ROSE."

33:30.399 --> 33:32.053
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

33:32.097 --> 33:33.663
JUST CAME TO ME.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.926
OK.
"CENTER OF THE ROSE."

33:35.970 --> 33:38.755
DOES--DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

33:38.799 --> 33:42.629
BEFORE HE DIED, GRANT TOLD
ME ABOUT THIS ANCIENT TEMPLE.

33:42.672 --> 33:46.894
HE CALLED IT...
"THE FLOWER OF THE HEAVENS."

33:46.937 --> 33:48.852
- THE CENTER OF THE ROSE.
- COULD BE.

33:48.896 --> 33:51.420
- WHERE IS THIS TEMPLE?
- IT'S IN KANCHANABURI.

33:51.464 --> 33:54.249
IT'S ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY BY MOTORCYCLE.
OK, LET'S GO.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.643
WAIT.

33:58.079 --> 34:01.213
UH...
I'M SORRY, NICKY.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.215
I--I REALLY AM.
HENRY, WE REALLY DON'T

34:03.258 --> 34:05.434
HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.
NO, I KNOW I HURT YOU,

34:05.478 --> 34:08.481
AND I SHOULD HAVE REACHED OUT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

34:11.484 --> 34:13.442
I WAS AFRAID THAT--
THAT IF I CALLED--

34:13.486 --> 34:15.444
- WHAT?
- THAT--

34:15.488 --> 34:17.403
THAT YOU'D COME!

34:19.144 --> 34:22.190
I THOUGHT...I HAD
TO DO THIS ALONE--

34:22.234 --> 34:25.106
YEAH, YEAH, YOU SAID
THAT 4 MONTHS AGO,

34:25.150 --> 34:29.023
AND I--I GET IT, BUT
WE COULD HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.547
YOU KNOW WHY I FELL
IN LOVE WITH YOU?

34:31.591 --> 34:34.376
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

34:34.420 --> 34:37.031
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE IN PAIN,
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE STRUGGLING,

34:37.075 --> 34:39.120
I--I SEE IT,

34:39.164 --> 34:41.731
AND I'VE NEVER HAD THAT.

34:41.775 --> 34:45.126
EVER SINCE I WAS
A KID, I'VE FELT...

34:45.170 --> 34:47.781
INCOMPLETE.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.392
SO WHEN THE LAST THING
MY DAD TELLS ME IS

34:50.436 --> 34:53.047
THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING ABOUT ME,

34:53.091 --> 34:55.049
I THOUGHT,
"THIS IS IT."

34:55.093 --> 34:57.660
IF I CAN SOLVE
THIS...THIS MYSTERY,

34:57.704 --> 34:59.662
I--I'D...

34:59.706 --> 35:02.491
I'D FINALLY KNOW
WHO I AM...

35:02.535 --> 35:05.364
AND I'D FINALLY BE
WORTHY OF YOU.

35:06.843 --> 35:09.803
OH, IT SOUNDS SO STUPID.
NO, IT DOESN'T SOUND--

35:09.846 --> 35:13.198
NO, I KNOW IT'S STUPID BECAUSE
THE SECOND I SAW YOU TODAY,

35:13.241 --> 35:16.505
EVERY CELL IN MY BODY
SCREAMED AT ME, "THIS IS IT!"

35:16.549 --> 35:19.378
THIS IS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE, YOU AND ME,

35:19.421 --> 35:21.467
TOGETHER.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.908
HENRY, I WANT YOU TO
FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

35:27.951 --> 35:30.432
AND I WANT TO HELP YOU.

35:32.434 --> 35:35.220
BUT WE CAN'T GO BACK.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.619
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO? WE CAN'T JUST STAY HERE.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.621
SHE'S RIGHT.
WE CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.623
WE WERE BARELY A MILE
FROM HERE WHEN HE ATTACKED.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.234
HE'S GETTING CLOSER.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.931
LOOK,
WE'VE BEEN SAFE HERE.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.933
WE HAVE ENOUGH SUPPLIES
FOR THE MOMENT, OK?

35:52.976 --> 35:54.935
WE'LL JUST--
WE'LL GO OUT LESS,

35:54.978 --> 35:57.329
MAKE DO WITH LESS,
JUST FOR NOW.

35:57.372 --> 36:00.245
OR WE FIGHT.

36:01.855 --> 36:04.336
I KNOW I ONLY JUST GOT
HERE, BUT THIS LIFE--

36:04.379 --> 36:06.860
HIDING, WAITING TO BE TAKEN
OUT-- IT'S NO WAY TO EXIST.

36:06.903 --> 36:09.079
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

36:09.123 --> 36:11.908
THAT THING CAN DESTROY US
WITH A SINGLE BLOW.

36:11.952 --> 36:14.476
WE CAN'T FIGHT IT.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.478
I CAN.

36:18.393 --> 36:20.352
THE HARVESTER CUT ME,

36:20.395 --> 36:23.006
AND I DIDN'T DIE,

36:23.050 --> 36:26.619
SO, MAYBE I AM ALIVE

36:26.662 --> 36:30.710
OR JUST...
DIFFERENT SOMEHOW. IT DOESN'T MATTER.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.627
IF YOU'LL HELP ME...

36:34.670 --> 36:37.630
I'LL FIGHT HIM...

36:37.673 --> 36:40.198
AND I'LL KILL HIM.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.860
SHOULD BE
JUST UP AHEAD.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.480
THIS MUST BE IT.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.569
THE FOUNDATION.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.749
THIS IS IT, RIGHT?

37:09.792 --> 37:11.751
WHAT NOW?

37:11.794 --> 37:13.796
I DON'T KNOW.

37:16.756 --> 37:19.889
YOU SAID THAT WE CAN'T GO BACK.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN?

37:19.933 --> 37:22.327
HENRY, LET'S
FIGURE THIS OUT.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.807
NO, NOT TILL I KNOW.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.072
ARE WE DONE?
YEAH.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.989
I'M SORRY.

37:33.033 --> 37:36.210
I...I HAD TO MOVE ON.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.869
HELLO, HENRY.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.437
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.178
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT I WANT.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.798
IT'S NOT MUCH
TO LOOK AT, IS IT?

37:58.841 --> 38:01.017
BUT IT'S NOT
ABOUT HOW IT LOOKS.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.019
IT'S ABOUT
WHAT IT CAN DO.

38:03.063 --> 38:04.673
GENESIS.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.417
LET US GO.
YOU HAVE THE COMPASS ALREADY

38:09.461 --> 38:12.072
AND THE FOUNDATION'S RIGHT HERE.
RULE OF 3, HENRY.

38:12.115 --> 38:14.117
THE COMPASS
AND THE LODESTONE

38:14.161 --> 38:16.163
MUST BE BROUGHT
TO THE FOUNDATION.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.165
YEAH, WELL, I CAN'T
HELP YOU THERE.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.167
MY FATHER USED
TO HAVE THE LODESTONE,

38:20.210 --> 38:22.430
BUT HONESTLY,
I THOUGHT YOU STOLE IT.

38:22.474 --> 38:25.085
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW.

38:25.128 --> 38:28.654
I CROSSED PATHS WITH
YOUR FATHER YEARS AGO.

38:28.697 --> 38:31.178
OFFERED TO JOIN FORCES.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.049
HE REFUSED.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.834
CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

38:34.877 --> 38:37.445
HE DIDN'T WANT MONEY.

38:37.489 --> 38:40.100
HE DIDN'T WANT POWER.

38:40.143 --> 38:42.711
I COULD NEVER
FIGURE OUT WHY HE WAS

38:42.755 --> 38:45.366
SO DETERMINED TO GET
HIS HANDS ON THE COMPASS.

38:45.410 --> 38:49.849
THEN I DISCOVERED SOMETHING
INTERESTING ABOUT THE LODESTONE.

38:49.892 --> 38:54.201
THE LODESTONE ISN'T
JUST AN OBJECT.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.421
IT'S A VESSEL.

38:56.464 --> 38:58.466
FOR WHAT?

38:58.510 --> 39:01.121
A SPARK, THE ENERGY

39:01.164 --> 39:03.863
TO ANOINT
THE COMPASS BEARER,

39:03.906 --> 39:07.475
THE ONE PERSON
WHO CAN INITIATE

39:07.519 --> 39:10.391
GENESIS.

39:15.222 --> 39:17.790
OH!
HENRY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:17.833 --> 39:20.401
HENRY? HENRY!

39:20.445 --> 39:23.056
THE LODESTONE.

39:23.099 --> 39:25.058
IT CHOSE YOU, HENRY.

39:25.101 --> 39:28.366
YOU...ARE
THE COMPASS BEARER.

39:29.802 --> 39:32.413
I'D JUST KILL YOU,
BUT ONLY YOU

39:32.457 --> 39:34.763
CAN BRING THE COMPASS
TO THE FOUNDATION.

39:34.807 --> 39:38.637
ONLY YOU...
CAN ACHIEVE GENESIS.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.987
WHAT DO YOU
WANT IT FOR?

39:42.945 --> 39:45.905
IT'S SAID TO BE
A VERY POWERFUL LOCATOR

39:45.948 --> 39:47.907
OF MYSTICAL ENERGY,

39:47.950 --> 39:50.431
A DIVINE OBJECT.

39:50.475 --> 39:55.001
THE THING THAT FIRST
BROUGHT MAGIC INTO OUR WORLD.

39:55.044 --> 39:58.613
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF GENESIS,

39:58.657 --> 40:01.616
YOU WILL BE
MY INSTRUMENT.

40:01.660 --> 40:05.620
THAT'S WHAT DROVE YOUR
FATHER FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.622
HE WANTED TO FIND
THE COMPASS

40:07.666 --> 40:09.624
TO DESTROY IT,

40:09.668 --> 40:11.670
AND TO PROTECT

40:11.713 --> 40:13.411
YOU.

40:15.978 --> 40:18.024
DAD?

40:18.067 --> 40:20.026
PLEASE STAY WITH ME.
STAY WITH ME. DAD?

40:22.463 --> 40:24.465
I WON'T DO IT.

40:53.886 --> 40:56.497
MMM!
DON'T RESIST, HENRY.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.195
THIS IS
WHAT YOU WERE MEANT TO BECOME.

41:02.634 --> 41:05.593
AAH!

41:12.470 --> 41:14.602
TOO LATE.
CAN'T BE STOPPED.

41:14.646 --> 41:16.125
AAH!

41:36.537 --> 41:38.713
AAH!

41:40.410 --> 41:42.238
HENRY?

42:14.053 --> 42:15.533
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!

42:15.576 --> 42:17.099
NICE SHOT, MOM!
