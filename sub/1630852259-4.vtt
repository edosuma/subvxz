<i>Life and birth brings the turtles.</i>

32:10.970 --> 32:15.183
<i>Where we smell bird poop,</i>
<i>they smell home.</i>

(CAMERA CLICKS)

32:20.688 --> 32:22.565
(CAMERA CLICKS)

32:25.568 --> 32:27.654
Decay is bringing the sharks.

32:28.196 --> 32:31.866
Where we smell death... they smell dinner.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.205
<i>We pick up those same smells.</i>

32:37.956 --> 32:40.792
<i>It's just that we don't</i>
<i>truly understand them.</i>

32:43.836 --> 32:48.633
<i>What triggers a nostalgic memory for us</i>
<i>might mean life or death</i>

32:48.716 --> 32:50.176
<i>in the animal world.</i>

32:52.011 --> 32:56.516
<i>The smell of cut grass</i>
<i>is really a cry for help.</i>

32:58.142 --> 33:03.189
<i>The smell of forest rain</i>
<i>is really the smell of fungus.</i>

33:04.107 --> 33:09.112
<i>And the smell of sea</i>
<i>is actually the smell of shore.</i>

33:10.405 --> 33:11.948
CRISTINA: You know what's even crazier?

33:12.782 --> 33:15.410
They can remember
that exact smell for decades

33:15.910 --> 33:18.663
because they don't come back here
until their breeding age,

33:18.746 --> 33:20.581
and that could be thirty years or older.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.084
WILL: Thirty years.

33:23.668 --> 33:27.630
They remember this place from a smell
they smelled thirty years ago?

33:28.715 --> 33:30.800
CRISTINA: Do you remember
how anything smelled thirty years ago?

33:30.925 --> 33:32.385
-I don't... No. (LAUGHS)
-(CHUCKLES)

33:33.177 --> 33:37.849
Uh. Sunday morning breakfast
and the smell of bacon frying.

33:38.224 --> 33:40.268
That smell was spectacular.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.521
And I remember my father
who was a... a mechanic,

33:43.604 --> 33:45.106
<i>-so he always worked with...</i>
-CRISTINA: <i>Ah...</i>

33:45.273 --> 33:49.569
WILL: <i>...oils and he had, like,</i>
<i>a 20-year-old leather key pouch.</i>

33:50.028 --> 33:53.614
<i>The combination of oil and dirt ground</i>
<i>into that leather,</i>

33:53.781 --> 33:55.616
I actually used to like the smell.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.952
-What would possess you to smell...
-WILL: I never...

33:58.077 --> 34:00.163
-Yes, I remember that.
-(LAUGHS)

34:02.248 --> 34:06.753
WILL: <i>More than any other sense,</i>
<i>smell is intertwined with our memory</i>

34:07.045 --> 34:08.171
<i>and our emotions.</i>

34:10.256 --> 34:13.718
<i>It's an ancient instinct</i>
<i>that's just as powerful today.</i>

34:16.512 --> 34:20.850
It's a universal language
that links each and every living thing.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.146
CRISTINA: Come on, little one.
You can make it.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.192
Good job, young fella.

34:34.864 --> 34:39.285
But its meaning is personal
to you and you alone.
