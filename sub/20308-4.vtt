WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:04.295
JOYCE:
<i>Irwin wants to move the trial tomorrow.</i>

00:04.879 --> 00:05.964
I think it'll work.

00:06.589 --> 00:09.759
We've been doing five boxes a day,
and we've got four to go.

00:11.052 --> 00:15.098
God, Furillo, the agony
of offering a client's testimony

00:15.348 --> 00:17.684
in a 12-defendant drug case.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.104
Joyce, where are all my suits?

00:21.730 --> 00:24.357
Cleaners. Be done this afternoon.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.610
-What am I supposed to wear today?
-I left the blue one.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.616
-Joyce.
-What?

00:34.701 --> 00:36.244
-These have a hole.
-Ugh.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.539
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.207
I've been working ten hours a day

00:41.291 --> 00:43.877
in a courthouse cubicle
for the past two weeks,

00:43.960 --> 00:45.712
and I don't have time to inspect
every one of your suits.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.380
I could have taken them in myself,
you know.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.923
(laughs) Come on.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.551
You haven't been to a cleaners
since Carter was president.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.053
That's ridiculous.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.179
-That's wrong.
-Here.

00:55.055 --> 00:55.889
Wear these.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.393
In 'Nam we called this
a situational interdiction.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.312
The mugger completes his raid

01:02.395 --> 01:04.898
and then heads for his sanctuary
in the park

01:04.981 --> 01:07.108
where our stepped-up perimeter patrols

01:07.192 --> 01:11.654
intercept along these borders here,
which the felon needs cross to safety.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.366
And so with your help,
sectors B and C people,

01:15.450 --> 01:18.912
Van Buren Park
is won back from the boonies

01:18.995 --> 01:21.498
and transformed into a demilitarized zone

01:22.248 --> 01:25.627
where the peace-loving folk
of our precinct

01:26.377 --> 01:30.924
can smoke their dope and transmit
their venereal disease in relative safety.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.509
(laughing)

01:32.592 --> 01:34.761
To which further regard, Item 10...

01:35.178 --> 01:37.263
Oh, worked with Ho Chi Minh,
why not the Hill?

01:37.347 --> 01:38.932
...Division Commander Swanson...

01:40.433 --> 01:42.268
-Andrew.
-Yes, sir?

01:43.019 --> 01:44.270
Something the whole class could enjoy?

01:44.354 --> 01:47.941
I was just trying to recollect.
I-- I thought we lost that war.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.359
(laughing)

01:50.610 --> 01:53.446
Memo indicates that Division's observation

01:53.530 --> 01:55.532
that the National Weather Service
now employs

01:55.615 --> 01:58.451
both male and female nomenclature
for hurricanes.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.037
To wit, at minimum, Division requests

02:01.121 --> 02:04.457
that in view of 17 percent female officers
in the department,

02:04.541 --> 02:08.169
all B sectors be denominated distaff.

02:08.253 --> 02:13.383
Examples given are Barb,
Beth, Belinda, or Bunny.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.052
Bunny? Sector Bunny?

02:16.886 --> 02:19.222
Item 12, we have a backup alert here,
people,

02:19.305 --> 02:23.226
for, uh, Officer Tina Russo's
undercover pursuit

02:23.309 --> 02:25.895
of one Alphonse Sonny Cappelito,

02:26.354 --> 02:28.815
who is accused
of the Amtrak warehouse heist

02:28.898 --> 02:30.984
and other high-stakes burglaries.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.153
I, uh, I think that's it, people.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.532
Oh, wait a minute. Hold. That is not it.
As you were.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.242
Not it at all.

02:39.325 --> 02:44.205
This precinct has received a post card
with a picture of a largemouth bass on it,

02:44.289 --> 02:46.541
and it is postmarked Williamsville.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.377
And it reads,
"Wish you were here. Wish I was there.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.255
No, really, recuperating great. Sarge."

02:52.338 --> 02:55.925
And it's in parenthesis, Stan Jablonski.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.927
(cheering)

02:59.345 --> 03:01.181
All right, be careful out there.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.600
The weather forecast is clear skies,

03:03.683 --> 03:06.394
high temperatures
with corresponding restlessness

03:06.477 --> 03:08.271
among the indigenous population.

03:09.022 --> 03:09.856
Be alert.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.737
Andy, Bobby, Domestic.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.115
You know what? I know I sound clichÃ©,

03:19.199 --> 03:21.576
but if these people just ate
the proper breakfast in the morning,

03:21.659 --> 03:24.954
there wouldn't be so much of this
domestic violence first thing in the day.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.497
-Captain.
-Gentlemen.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.292
Captain look a little weird to you today?

03:30.084 --> 03:30.919
Frank.

03:32.879 --> 03:33.796
A sport coat?

03:34.297 --> 03:37.425
-Joyce sent all my suits to the cleaners.
-8:00 with the chief, Frank.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.386
(siren blares)

03:40.970 --> 03:43.598
I was just thinking, a couple eggs,
maybe a muffin.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.225
Kind of makes you feel content
in the morning.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.519
But these people, you know,
all they do is shoot dope all the time.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.314
Shoot it all morning. Shoot it all night.
Oh, lord, Bobby. Look at that.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.524
I say don't come up here right now.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.652
I'll drop this child right now.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.238
Okay, no one's gonna come up.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.323
Get Goldblume and the paramedics.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.910
Give me my baby!

04:03.993 --> 04:05.995
-Look out, Renko!
-(woman screams)

04:07.705 --> 04:10.124
(baby crying)

04:10.208 --> 04:11.584
(applause)

04:11.668 --> 04:14.295
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

04:15.088 --> 04:16.381
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:16.464 --> 04:20.218
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:20.301 --> 04:21.844
(sirens wailing)

04:27.600 --> 04:30.603
(theme music playing)

05:45.845 --> 05:50.516
TINA: God, this only about...
80 blocks from where I got to be.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.728
Relax. Pick out a tape, play some music.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.855
I told you an hour ago I got to go home.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.191
I got to take my mom to the beauty parlor.

05:58.441 --> 06:02.612
Here. Want to take a cab?
Here, I'll pull over.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.405
You can take a cab,
you're so late for everything.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.783
I'm not getting out in Zulu land.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.827
Then relax.
It's only ten minutes out of your way.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.163
Half hour.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.290
Shut up.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.458
(laughs)

06:22.382 --> 06:23.299
(bell dings)

06:36.187 --> 06:37.313
Play a little music.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.905
-How you doing, Marty?
-Hey, Mr. C.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.744
He's going into the office.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.333
Out comes the package.

07:04.841 --> 07:05.675
Get in the car.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.260
Come on, get back in the car.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.512
-Stand still.
-(tires screech)

07:09.595 --> 07:12.181
-Still! I'm a police officer.
-Hold it right there.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.434
-You hump.
-Hands up.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.018
Come on.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.608
Nice job.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.901
ANDY: Yes. Yes, he does.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.988
He's got several witnesses.
We got all kinds of witnesses.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.866
No, we don't have any film.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.035
Yeah, I'll hold on. How do you like this?

07:33.119 --> 07:35.580
Police officer catches a little baby
coming right out of the sky like that

07:35.663 --> 07:37.331
and TV network
won't have nothing to do with it

07:37.415 --> 07:39.750
'cause if there ain't no film
it's like it never even happened.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.669
Admiration of fellow officers, Robert.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.630
It is the only rock our pride stands on
with any assurance.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.507
Admiration and PR talents.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.927
Officers, Mr. Monroe's lawyer
awaits your 317.

07:50.011 --> 07:50.845
I'll take it.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.390
Andy, Andy, hey, what's this?

07:57.894 --> 07:58.728
What?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.480
NFL receiver catching a baby.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.565
(laughs) That's funny, J.D.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.400
Line two, Henry.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.194
Thanks.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.281
Goldblume.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.327
Steve who?

08:15.995 --> 08:16.829
Steve Merkur?

08:17.455 --> 08:18.831
From Clinton High School?

08:19.207 --> 08:20.833
-Lieutenant.
-Chief.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.085
No, No, I'd love to.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.545
Are you in town?

08:25.004 --> 08:26.631
Renko,<i> Evening Trib, </i>line four.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.757
See there?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.301
Print media
still has a sense of news priority.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.178
Andrew J. Renko, Hill Street station.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.721
It's a zoo there, Frank.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.974
He's had one or two race incidents, minor.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.393
Now suddenly
he's got Blacks riding with Black,

08:39.477 --> 08:42.813
whites with white, every damn unit
in the place is a powder keg.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.065
They call him Captain Taco.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.150
Half the men at Polk Avenue
call him Captain Taco.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.277
-Have you talked to him?
-No, I want you to talk to him.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.862
Stan is ready to go in,

08:50.154 --> 08:52.823
but we need him there tomorrow
or it won't make sense.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.868
Look, Frank,
the idea is I go in with the vice platoon.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.496
I appear to be overseeing
the vice platoon's activities,

08:58.579 --> 09:00.790
but really I'm troubleshooting
with the precinct's Blacks.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.959
You're taking over
Ray Calletano's precinct.

09:03.042 --> 09:06.462
Worst case. My intension is to help him
right it for himself.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.465
Chief, I don't have enough facts
about the whole situation.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.552
I just gave you the facts.
We've got a runaway precinct.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.555
Look, Frank,
just get Ray to sit down with Stan.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.056
The three of you, have a lunch.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.891
I won't ask him to relinquish power.

09:19.267 --> 09:23.521
I swear, Frank, that this is not a plot
to hose Calletano.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.732
But a cop race war on page one
will be devastating.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.278
You've got the ghetto. Your precinct
will suffer worse than anyone's.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.285
Henry.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.290
Would you see if you can find
Ray Calletano for me, please?

09:44.875 --> 09:45.793
Thank you, Captain.

09:46.168 --> 09:49.880
None of us wants to see Raymundo
with a lot of brown burrito on his face.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.594
This is sartorial change of pace,
isn't it, Frank?

09:54.677 --> 09:57.138
Uh, Joyce sent all my suits
to the cleaners.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.181
Divorce. (imitates gunshot)

09:59.432 --> 10:00.683
The great equalizer.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.106
Al, you look weird with a mustache.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.275
Makes you look like a terrorist.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.820
I don't know, maybe an exterminator.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.489
It's amazing. It's a classic.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.991
Hey, nice bust, Officer.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.327
That's the understatement of the day.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.874
Captain, Phil Gresham, IAD.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.877
-Got a minute?
-Not really. Urgent?

10:28.169 --> 10:30.963
Uh, I suspect B&amp;E involvement
of one of your men.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.841
-How so?
-Well, the cop in question

10:33.924 --> 10:37.303
has busted several individuals
over the past ten days,

10:37.386 --> 10:40.264
all of whom, while they were in the joint,
had places broke into.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.391
-Who's the cop?
-Lieutenant Norman Buntz.

10:43.726 --> 10:44.685
Walk me to my car.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.813
-Good work this morning, Bobby.
-Thanks, Captain.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.940
Officer Hill, I have some folks here
who want to see you.

10:50.024 --> 10:53.277
Oh, hi. Hey, little burger.

10:53.361 --> 10:56.322
-This little burger.
-The doctor said he's okay.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.703
Catch me up on Howard.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.664
That was dreadful, top to bottom.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.874
-How's he doing?
-Actually, fairly well.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.212
Six months he'll have his rank back.
The June Review.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.589
Well, I hope so.
I mean, I'm certainly gonna fight for him.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.300
If I'm on his board,
you know he'll have it back.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.094
How are things going around here, Ray?

11:18.177 --> 11:21.013
Oh, very well. We got our new vehicles.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.140
They are computerizing the 911s.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.350
What about the men? Any problems?

11:24.433 --> 11:26.852
Oh, I suppose a few. The normal.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.063
I'm getting better at it, Frank.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.899
I defuse instead of confront.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.526
Why?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.778
I'll tell you why I'm here.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.281
Uh, Chief wanted me and you
and Stan Williams

11:39.365 --> 11:42.535
to sit down and thrash out
a couple situations.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.203
Regarding the precinct?

11:44.286 --> 11:46.080
You know the new vice allocations?

11:46.956 --> 11:50.876
He thought maybe Stan could come over
and see if there's any problems.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.546
But I told you, there aren't.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.881
Could we go out for half an hour?

11:55.965 --> 11:57.383
-Sure.
-(knocks)

11:57.883 --> 11:58.801
You wanted to see me?

12:00.594 --> 12:02.471
-One minute, please, Frank.
-Sure.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.854
-Go ahead, Rayburn.
-I'm sorry, Captain.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.329
-Ready?
-Let's do it.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.957
-Understood, Rayburn?
-Yes, sir.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.793
Loose lips sink ships, sir.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.015
What's it look like?

12:47.266 --> 12:51.771
All of his Michigan Avenue statements
plus the last two federal interrogations.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.147
Right. (groans)

12:54.857 --> 12:57.026
Why don't we say you give me the feds,

12:57.109 --> 12:59.361
I pass on Michigan Avenue
and we're finished?

13:00.946 --> 13:02.990
(chuckles) Just a thought.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.119
-Wouldn't it be nice to eat lunch today?
-(phone rings)

13:07.661 --> 13:08.954
(groans) Assistant DA Bernstein.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.331
-FRANK:<i> Hi, Irwin.</i>
-Oh, Frank.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.963
I have been grumping
for the last two hours, Furillo.

13:18.714 --> 13:19.965
You owe me an apology.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.010
<i>Well, it's your lucky day.</i>
<i>I called to apologize.</i>

13:23.093 --> 13:24.762
-You did?
-Everybody who sees me

13:24.845 --> 13:27.389
thinks I'm his high school
English teacher, but who cares?

13:28.432 --> 13:31.060
My wife was thoughtful enough
to take my filthy,

13:31.143 --> 13:34.814
<i>shiny, spotted, soiled suits in,</i>
<i>and I want to take you to dinner.</i>

13:36.065 --> 13:37.900
You're being facetious, Furillo.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.986
-Fairly expensive dinner.
-Okay.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.655
I'll pick your suits up this afternoon.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.824
<i>-See you.</i>
-Mm-hmm. Talk later.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.787
See, if Leah and I
had been able to do that,

13:49.870 --> 13:51.247
we would probably still be together.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.207
Any chance of reconciliation?

13:53.541 --> 13:54.625
She's living with a guy.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.002
And I've got a girlfriend, so...

13:57.086 --> 13:59.380
You do? Irwin, that's terrific.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.342
She's very nice. Uh, she's Jewish.

14:04.009 --> 14:04.844
Very nice.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.013
When the divorce is final,
we'll probably get married.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.185
Come on, what do you got?
Oh, is that the Damiano transcript?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.645
My client Mr. Crespus.

14:14.728 --> 14:18.274
He denies he said any of this
and if cross-examined, will disavow.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.027
I'd be a fly on the wall for a few days.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.321
Then I'd try to open up some channels
with the Black offices

14:24.405 --> 14:25.990
and after that, the white ones.

14:26.490 --> 14:29.034
-Coordinating with you, of course, Ray.
-Of course.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.579
You know, when we founded
the Black Officers Coalition,

14:31.996 --> 14:34.540
rule number one
was listen to the brothers.

14:34.623 --> 14:38.460
If I have any expertise, Ray,
it's from that experience, nothing else.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.296
-Of course.
-I don't, uh,

14:40.379 --> 14:41.672
I don't think it's Stan's intention

14:41.755 --> 14:43.966
to interfere
with your chain of command, Ray.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.385
-Not at all.
-Of course.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.553
I understand that.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.556
His official assignment would be vice.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.392
Damn, it's 12:00.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.605
I have a meeting with Lt. Morgan.
Will you excuse me?

15:00.733 --> 15:01.650
Pretty big hurry.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.780
Captain, on this Norman Buntz thing.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.366
I've got two more burgs confirmed.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.952
You're telling me
that everybody he collars

15:12.036 --> 15:14.371
just coincidently gets cleaned out?

15:15.623 --> 15:16.790
Norman, my office.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.252
Phil Gresham, IAD.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.009
I don't know, what?

15:27.676 --> 15:31.597
NFL wide receiver catching a baby
thrown out a window.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.266
-(laughs)
-Doesn't that joke get old?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.352
Bobby, my man. Congratulations.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.895
I think the joke stinks.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.563
What, the NFL receiver?

15:39.647 --> 15:42.316
Yeah, the NFL receiver and the baby.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.401
-What?
-You think about it.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.950
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, Gresham.
That's real downtown thinking, you know.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.119
Six of your low-grade arrests, Buntz.
Six places robbed.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.622
And I suppose I go rob these guys' places

15:56.705 --> 16:00.584
'cause nobody would ever figure out
this big coincidence, huh? (scoffs)

16:00.668 --> 16:03.003
That's a real fine tribute
to my intelligence, Captain.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.090
Well, Norm, look. Let's go over
the circumstances of each arrest.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.884
-There could be a common thread.
-Yeah, they're hummers.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.303
If they're hummers,
it's because your fat head division memo

16:11.387 --> 16:13.847
about warrant executions got listened to.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.724
That's true, Gresham.
Last week we were trying

16:15.808 --> 16:18.018
to build the body counts
pursuant to the memo.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.479
-On the other hand, Norm.
-What,<i> et tu, </i>Captain? That it?

16:20.771 --> 16:22.314
Norman, answer the coincidence.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.608
I'll answer it. I'll take care of it.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.735
I'm continuing my investigation.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.321
I said I'll take care of it. Am I excused?

16:32.783 --> 16:36.495
Captain, Counselor Weller
for Officer Russo's suspect Cappelito.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.163
Thanks, Howard. Come on in.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.460
-(sighs) Would you excuse us, please?
-Yes, sir.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.838
-How are you?
-Captain.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.716
This could sound arrogant,
but I don't intend it to.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.843
Could I do you a favor?

16:51.218 --> 16:54.847
And in exchange you'll owe my client
Cappelito one. Somewhere down the line.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.558
I should think he'd be wanting
the favor now, not later.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.685
Normally, yes.
Today is special circumstances.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.271
Which I take it has to do with the favor
he's gonna do us?

17:02.980 --> 17:05.607
Look, she slept with him, Captain.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.526
Who? Who slept with whom?

17:07.609 --> 17:09.278
Your cop Russo slept with Sonny.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.280
You have proof of this?

17:11.488 --> 17:14.783
Sonny's a creep,
but in this area he doesn't lie.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.203
So you're asking
that the case be dismissed.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.205
Do it now. Save your young cop.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.999
Save the department the embarrassment.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.542
And this is the favor, Captain.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.379
I'm giving you a day
to do the right thing yourself.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.631
Mr. Weller, it must be

17:29.715 --> 17:31.925
that you don't practice up here
very often.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.720
Or you'd be aware of the frequency

17:34.803 --> 17:38.182
with which sexual misconduct charges
brought against our officers

17:38.265 --> 17:40.809
are used as components
of criminal defenses.

17:41.643 --> 17:45.731
Please don't be coming up here
doing me any favors on your client's word.

17:48.859 --> 17:51.445
Look, she's probably a good cop.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.158
-But girls tend to be girls, right?
-And lawyers tend to be lawyers.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.206
So, uh, when was it exactly you say

18:02.289 --> 18:04.583
your place was burgled, Mr...?

18:04.666 --> 18:06.001
-Shanks.
-Shanks.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.670
Between Friday and Tuesday.
I was away for a few days.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.172
Ray, amigo.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.466
Stand firm, Howard.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.344
This, too, shall pass.

18:16.595 --> 18:21.058
GRESHAM: Sergeant, going to need access
to your off record bin files.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.894
There's an informant
in all of Buntz's arrests.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.813
-Where were you?
-Guy named Thurston.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.649
You'll have to have captain
or above authorization.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.401
I asked you where you were on those days,
Mr. Shanks.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.112
I was... out.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.030
I'll file that later, okay?

18:36.907 --> 18:38.450
Would they treat you this way?

18:39.201 --> 18:41.578
Would they treat any Anglo captain?

18:42.079 --> 18:44.498
Ray, I hardly qualify as an Anglo captain.

18:44.581 --> 18:47.876
You can joke, but believe me,
I can go to the Hispanic press.

18:48.585 --> 18:52.297
-And, Frank, I am disappointed in you.
-That's unwarranted.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.299
There's no harm in talking things out.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.968
Don't play naive with me.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.053
Daniels must think I'm his toy.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.597
What he actually thinks
is you have some problems over there.

19:00.681 --> 19:05.310
Race problems? Which precinct has none?
It's always just below the surface.

19:05.686 --> 19:09.064
Well, at your precinct, they're above
and they're out there.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.024
Is this your belief, Frank?

19:12.025 --> 19:14.611
Were you really just
the innocent messenger?

19:15.487 --> 19:18.282
-Or did you set me up?
-I didn't set you up.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.743
Frankly, until this morning,

19:22.870 --> 19:24.746
I didn't have a clue about any of this.

19:26.456 --> 19:27.374
On the other hand...

19:30.252 --> 19:33.422
I found that in your coffee area.
There was a stack of them.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.926
Look, whether Daniels was clumsy

19:38.302 --> 19:41.388
or even whether he treated you fairly,
but that's a side issue.

19:41.889 --> 19:45.350
If you're having a problem with your men,
that's what a captain addresses first.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.393
Which I am.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.189
It may be that you need some help, Ray.
Nobody likes that.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.566
Everybody likes to think
he can hang tough.

19:54.651 --> 19:55.485
Would you help me?

19:55.861 --> 19:58.322
I don't have the familiarity
that Stan Williams has.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.366
My help to you
is to ask you to sit down with him.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.702
I won't give up my captaincy.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.079
Nobody's asking you to, as far as I know.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.794
When you get a hold of him, call me.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.134
Nelly.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.513
A greaseball with glasses
comes around here looking for me,

20:23.597 --> 20:25.515
tell him I went looking up to his place,
all right?

20:25.599 --> 20:27.100
Will do, Lieutenant.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.479
So what'd you do after writer school?

20:31.104 --> 20:34.274
Well, I substitute taught
a couple days a week

20:34.358 --> 20:36.360
and then, um,
I was a bartender for a while.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.654
But you were writing all this time?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.072
The habit.

20:40.822 --> 20:41.657
There you go.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.327
-What happened with it?
-Well, uh, I finished a couple of books

20:45.410 --> 20:48.080
and got a lot of letters from publishers.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.958
And you know,
I would sit up there in my room

20:51.041 --> 20:52.960
thinking I'm doing this great thing.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.921
That I was gonna end war. Make people cry.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.758
And then I would get
these one-paragraph computer notes

20:59.841 --> 21:02.386
with my name not quite lined up
with the rest of the letter

21:02.719 --> 21:06.014
and I would feel so ashamed.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.852
What kind of--
What kind of a jerk am I anyway?

21:12.145 --> 21:14.940
But the guy who wrote you this time,
this wasn't a form letter?

21:15.774 --> 21:18.068
No, he said to come in.

21:18.151 --> 21:19.945
So I hopped a Hound.

21:20.028 --> 21:22.197
-Sounds good.
-Yeah, it's great.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.574
Well, I mean, who knows?

21:26.285 --> 21:29.705
You know, you said you felt ashamed.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.457
-Not all the time.
-Yeah, but you shouldn't.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.253
I mean, I'm looking at a guy
who did what he wanted to do.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.171
Stuck at it, took all the punishment.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.132
That's something to be proud of.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.137
All those times, remember,
when we were at the Clinton.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.431
We both said we were gonna be writers.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.476
But for some reason,
you did it and I didn't.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.105
And I admire the hell out of that.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.399
Just be careful what you wish for.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.236
Come on, let's get you a place.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.113
(TV playing in Spanish)

22:08.160 --> 22:10.412
SHANKS: You're dead, man.
You're dead meat.

22:10.871 --> 22:11.872
Where's my tape machine, huh?

22:13.290 --> 22:15.208
Hey, police! Put down the iron!

22:15.292 --> 22:17.461
Put it down.
What are you doing here, Shanks?

22:17.544 --> 22:20.088
Didn't I just bust you?
Aren't you just out of the cage?

22:20.172 --> 22:22.341
Yeah, your damn snitch robbed me.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.217
He rats me out
then he breaks into my place.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.304
You're the police?
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.891
Don't make me fall down laughing
with a heart attack, huh, Sid.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.352
-He's your snitch, Buntz.
-All right, get out!

22:33.435 --> 22:34.353
Get up against the wall.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.231
All right, turn around.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.944
All right, now, ace,
let's just say for the hell of it

22:43.028 --> 22:46.031
that we forget about this little break-in
with the tire iron,

22:46.114 --> 22:49.785
which, with your parole, that's enough
to put you back upstate for a deuce.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.123
But if I hear one peep out of anybody

22:55.207 --> 22:58.377
about Sid's my snitch,
and I don't care how it gets out,

22:59.169 --> 23:00.796
I'm telling people you're my snitch.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.382
Are we understood here?

23:04.841 --> 23:06.051
W-- what about my tape machine?

23:12.933 --> 23:14.184
70 bucks?

23:14.726 --> 23:16.228
-Buy one hot.
-Excuse me.

23:16.311 --> 23:18.230
Pardon me, sir.
Are you arresting this man?

23:19.773 --> 23:21.400
He promised he wouldn't do it again.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.079
What about this meeting
in the Rainbow Room? New Year's Eve.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.748
Mr. Crespus indicates he was in San Juan.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.168
How could he have been in San Juan?

23:40.669 --> 23:43.630
He told six federal agents
he was with defendant Molina.

23:43.713 --> 23:45.590
I've got the tickets, Irwin.
I showed you the stubs.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.511
What you're telling me is that your client
is a pathological liar.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.389
Little late for that to be dawning on you,
old boy.

23:52.472 --> 23:56.893
Well, all I know is I have got
eight pounds of interrogation

23:56.977 --> 23:58.645
taken over four months' time

23:58.728 --> 23:59.771
and there is about...

23:59.855 --> 24:01.606
-(banging)
-...12 pages I can use here.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.024
What's going on out there?

24:05.193 --> 24:06.611
No, hey! (grunts)

24:06.695 --> 24:08.113
What do you think you're doing?

24:08.196 --> 24:10.449
-Where you going, pal?
-Shut up, you both!

24:10.532 --> 24:12.409
-Girl, come on. Come over here.
-No!

24:13.660 --> 24:15.871
Help! He's in here!

24:17.372 --> 24:18.373
Freeze, Tremaine.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.293
Come on, Tremaine.

24:21.376 --> 24:24.963
Judge Brodsky
is requesting your presence in part 44.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.339
Come on, move. Let's go.

24:27.215 --> 24:28.508
-You okay?
-Yeah.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.345
-Irwin, you all right?
-Yeah, yeah, I guess.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.306
I'm fine. You okay?

24:36.308 --> 24:37.142
Yeah.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.311
Wow.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.066
Let's go get some hot dogs.

24:46.359 --> 24:47.819
Whatever you say, Clark Kent.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.657
-Tina.
-Yes, Captain?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.451
-Good collar this morning.
-Thanks.

24:55.076 --> 24:57.329
No, thank you. (clears throat)

24:57.829 --> 25:00.081
There's an allegation
from Sonny Cappelito's lawyer

25:00.165 --> 25:02.209
that you slept with Cappelito
to make the arrest.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.752
Just tell me, true or false?

25:05.170 --> 25:06.880
-Cappelito said that?
-True or false?

25:07.881 --> 25:10.592
That slob? False.

25:10.884 --> 25:11.718
Thank you.

25:18.975 --> 25:21.102
I felt like a beetle
turned over on its back.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.355
Fourteen arms flailing around.

25:24.481 --> 25:25.899
Totally uncoordinated.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.568
It was like a fright reaction.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.070
Come on, you were terrific.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.657
You'd never guess I took boxing lessons
in grade school.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.659
Step, step, jab, back.

25:35.742 --> 25:38.119
Oscar Mandel's Gym and Workout.

25:38.662 --> 25:39.746
Toughen up the wimps.

25:40.163 --> 25:41.540
You were never a wimp.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.335
You know,
actually you're right about that.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.714
I was just an ordinary smart kid.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.550
I even had hair back then.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.594
Mm, good dog.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.471
You're all beef.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.682
Well, maybe you're all meat.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.809
Mind if we stop at the dry cleaner?

26:00.892 --> 26:03.270
-Mm-mm. Where is it?
-Just up the street.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.813
You know what I think about?

26:05.313 --> 26:07.566
I wish that you had stuck
with the DA's office.

26:08.066 --> 26:08.900
Oh.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.695
Why, so you wouldn't
have to argue with me?

26:11.778 --> 26:12.988
(chuckles) Not at all.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.156
I just like working with you.

26:16.449 --> 26:18.410
I think we work really well together,
don't you?

26:18.493 --> 26:19.703
Mm, we do.

26:20.203 --> 26:22.414
Well, maybe we ought to go out.

26:22.497 --> 26:23.748
Start a private practice.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.461
-Irwin.
-What?

26:29.170 --> 26:30.463
Frank's suits.

26:33.091 --> 26:36.219
Norman, you said you wanted bail jumpers,
I made inquiries.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.680
How did I know Lambrachis
was mixed up in this crap?

26:38.763 --> 26:42.350
And on what occasion did you inform me
this was pass-along information?

26:42.434 --> 26:45.228
Norman, all information is pass-along.

26:45.312 --> 26:49.733
Hey, 12 names from one skell
with a B&amp;E sheet three pages long.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.027
Anything out of line here, genius?

26:52.110 --> 26:55.822
I mean, does this raise any flags
in my drug-fried associate's fat head?

26:56.823 --> 26:59.117
Listen, Norm, we're gonna pop Lambrachis.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.328
-Calm down.
-Yeah, we better pop him, Sid,

27:01.411 --> 27:03.955
'cause I'll tell you,
if I get one little finger jammed up

27:04.039 --> 27:06.750
on account of this,
you got a whole arm in serious danger.

27:06.833 --> 27:09.836
All right, Norman, listen,
I want to go on record with this.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.088
You did not inquire my source on this.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.216
Oh, shut up, toad brain.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.676
Norman, please. Come on.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.305
-(stammers) Don't compare me to a reptile.
-Shut up!

27:23.099 --> 27:24.142
Amazing day, huh?

27:25.518 --> 27:26.811
It's had its surprises.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.439
Yeah, I meant the weather, actually.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.483
Amazing weather for October.

27:31.858 --> 27:36.154
Yeah. If it stays nice for the weekend
we're going up to Lake Kern.

27:36.237 --> 27:38.073
Frank's brother has a boat up there.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.243
Martha wants me to go
leaf watching on Sunday.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.913
-Martha's...?
-The woman I'm seeing.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.748
Martha. Marty.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.210
I like the name Martha.
Nice, old-fashioned.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.671
-Joyce.
-What?

27:53.838 --> 27:54.756
(sighs)

27:59.094 --> 27:59.928
What's wrong?

28:02.055 --> 28:04.140
Nothing. (chuckles)

28:05.266 --> 28:06.101
Nothing's wrong.

28:07.268 --> 28:08.103
(chuckles)

28:12.440 --> 28:14.275
Joyce, I just want to say...

28:16.611 --> 28:20.156
I just want to say I don't want to start
a law firm with you.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.616
(mumbles)

28:22.575 --> 28:24.452
Actually, I do, but that's not it.

28:27.414 --> 28:28.456
I'm getting divorced.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.292
My life is kind of free again.

28:32.168 --> 28:35.630
Before I know it, I will probably
be getting remarried.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.632
But somewhere in here,

28:38.800 --> 28:40.135
my heart has got to say something.

28:40.552 --> 28:44.723
For once in my life,
it has got to say the truth.

28:49.477 --> 28:50.854
The Dodgers belong in Brooklyn.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.690
Just kidding. (laughs)

28:54.983 --> 28:56.484
Actually, that's true, but that's not it.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.820
(chuckles) Irwin, are you okay?

28:59.612 --> 29:00.447
(laughs nervously)

29:02.282 --> 29:04.409
Joyce, I've had a crush on you
since I don't know when.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.831
Or I do know when.
Since the day I met you.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.418
I just--

29:14.377 --> 29:16.087
I don't expect anything to come of it.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.339
I don't expect us to run off
to South America together,

29:18.423 --> 29:20.592
but I don't know what I expect.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.970
But I have to have you know.

29:26.639 --> 29:27.932
And I have to know something.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.603
Do you have feelings for me?

29:34.898 --> 29:36.232
I mean, like a crush.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.740
If I say I love you...

29:53.041 --> 29:55.043
You got to ask, right?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.968
You got to ask once in your life.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.933
These are my conditions.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.394
No meetings
which I cannot be free to attend.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.855
No attacks on my command.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.441
I don't intend to attack your command.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.277
But you've got races not riding together.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.029
Fights in the locker room.

30:23.112 --> 30:26.241
Daily insults suggesting
you are not in command.

30:26.574 --> 30:27.951
We've got to get this stuff in the open.

30:28.034 --> 30:31.246
Ray, I think all Stan is saying
is don't handcuff him going in.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.456
And I say don't cuff me.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.500
You think I will not address
these problems?

30:35.875 --> 30:39.003
You're showing a lot of attitude
demanding this, demanding the other.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.547
You want me to go to Daniels,

30:40.630 --> 30:42.340
say Ray says no,
see what the chief does then?

30:42.632 --> 30:45.260
Are you threatening me?
You're going to tell the teacher?

30:45.343 --> 30:46.761
Ray, Stan, listen.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.471
The ingredients are simple.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.058
Stan goes in,
collects a list of complaints,

30:52.433 --> 30:54.727
both races, nudges both parties,

30:54.811 --> 30:58.439
preps a meeting where Stan can attend
but Ray presides.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.192
But I shall present
the reintegration proposals.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.487
-Reasonable?
-(sighs)

31:05.905 --> 31:06.739
And that's it.

31:07.365 --> 31:10.326
Remember, the goal here is reintegration
without further incidents.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.536
(knocks)

31:13.329 --> 31:14.497
Excuse me, Frank.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.958
Mr. Weller on the Russo arrest is back.

31:17.041 --> 31:17.876
Thanks, Howard.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.088
So tomorrow?

31:22.630 --> 31:23.548
Tomorrow morning.

31:28.052 --> 31:31.097
-You're a stubborn man, Captain.
-Tomorrow we attack the problem.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.101
Short clock, Ray. Lit fuse.

31:38.146 --> 31:38.980
May I?

31:47.405 --> 31:50.033
-Oh, put those away.
-They belong to Officer Russo.

31:50.617 --> 31:54.078
So does this. Don't tell me
they could belong to anyone, Captain.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.372
We wouldn't want to do forensics
on these panties.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.917
But ask Officer Russo, would you,

31:59.375 --> 32:02.587
if she's got a butterfly tattoo
on her upper right thigh?

32:03.504 --> 32:06.007
Ask her then give me a jingle.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.555
Come on, Officer Hill, don't be shy.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.265
-Let's take one more.
-That ought to do it.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.059
-Be in the Bulldog edition.
-All right.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.186
Aren't you gonna put the thing
where we were like two fielders

32:18.269 --> 32:20.188
going for it at the same time
and I deferred to him?

32:20.271 --> 32:22.357
-I deferred to him.
-Got it. Got it.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.452
-What happened?
-Oh.

32:35.203 --> 32:38.122
Couple of kids with butcher knives
shoved me in here, took my $80.

32:38.206 --> 32:42.460
And when that wasn't enough,
they, uh, threw my book up in the air.

32:43.544 --> 32:45.213
-We doing anything?
-Sector alert's out,

32:45.296 --> 32:46.839
but he doesn't want to drive around.

32:46.923 --> 32:47.799
Right, thanks.

32:49.676 --> 32:50.718
You know something?

32:50.802 --> 32:53.680
-This is my fault.
-HENRY: It is, huh?

32:54.013 --> 32:56.683
Well, yeah, I mean, I fit the profile
of the typical victim.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.101
-You do, huh?
-Look at my clothes.

32:58.184 --> 33:00.728
The way I walk around like I'm lost.
Like I'm daydreaming.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.231
You know what the last thing
I was thinking before they hit me?

33:03.314 --> 33:05.692
I'm yelling at this jerk editor, uh,

33:05.775 --> 33:07.110
"You claimed to have read
the fourth chapter?

33:07.193 --> 33:08.820
That is a boldfaced lie.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.238
Transit police notified?

33:11.072 --> 33:12.615
Yeah, transit and housing.

33:15.702 --> 33:16.661
How'd it go downtown?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.706
Oh, said this one
was a little too private.

33:19.789 --> 33:21.541
Uh, send me the next one.

33:21.624 --> 33:23.334
Yeah, next one, five years.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.545
You said there's other editors in town.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.672
You know, I just want to tell you this.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.633
I am not gonna be a victim again.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.678
Look, I punch a hole in my pocket, right?

33:33.761 --> 33:36.764
And I jam my hand down in there,
it looks like I'm packing a piece.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.268
Let's get some Band-Aids for your cuts.

33:40.893 --> 33:44.981
They threw my manuscript down
and it is my fault, you know?

33:45.231 --> 33:46.524
It is my fault!

33:52.405 --> 33:53.489
You know, Sidney,

33:54.032 --> 33:56.617
this first bunch I gave you
was a lost leader.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.202
ten bucks an address.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.913
Now I'm getting slightly insulted.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.540
I'm handing over wanted felons.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.585
You're handing over wanted nobodies, Fred.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.712
Which I happen to be splitting the take
with you on.

34:07.795 --> 34:11.007
-Don't make me herniate.
-I get 20 a head. And what else?

34:11.632 --> 34:14.052
You see, you haven't been
equally forthcoming with me.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.054
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

34:16.429 --> 34:18.890
You got a lot of toys around here, Fred.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.975
These all for your personal use?

34:21.059 --> 34:24.103
Or could it be
that you gave me those addresses

34:24.187 --> 34:26.647
so that you could rob those guys' places
when they were inside?

34:27.231 --> 34:29.650
FRED:
You're sick, Sid. You got bolts loose.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.361
Uh-huh.
Then you better treat me fair and square

34:32.445 --> 34:34.489
'cause you could wind up
in a cage yourself.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.324
Now that's stupid.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.201
Hey, don't misunderstand me.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.244
I didn't mean as a threat of arrest.

34:40.953 --> 34:43.790
I was simply proposing a split of profits,

34:43.873 --> 34:46.501
which, okay, I can see you're opposed to.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.128
This is a bad situation Freddie.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.630
FRED: What are you, a moron?

34:50.713 --> 34:52.173
You think I'm a two-bit snitch like you

34:52.256 --> 34:53.591
who works on ten bucks a pop, huh?

34:53.925 --> 34:55.843
This is a bad situation, Freddie.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.180
-Police, freeze!
-Freeze, police. Freeze, police.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.140
You police, freeze.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.895
(laughs)
You don't think I'd shoot him, huh?

35:06.270 --> 35:08.022
Get two goons for the price of one?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.607
-Norman!
-NORMAN: Of course I'd shoot him.

35:09.690 --> 35:10.691
Go on, ask him.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.362
Hey, Sid, you finally prove yourself
to be the kind of scum I like to shoot?

35:14.445 --> 35:16.072
-No!
-Yes.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.952
Come on, Lambrachis. This is stupid, huh?

35:21.452 --> 35:23.121
A gun against a knife?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.123
What do you think you are?

35:30.461 --> 35:31.879
All right, now get rid of the knife.
Come on.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.466
Up against the wall. Come on, come on.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.468
You know what ticks me off, Freddie?

35:37.552 --> 35:40.096
-All right.
-I paid you good money.

35:40.179 --> 35:42.473
And you expose me
to the disdain of my coworker.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.933
Somebody's gonna do you, Sid.

35:44.016 --> 35:45.518
Uh-uh, Freddie!

35:45.601 --> 35:47.728
Whoever it is, I'm sending him on you.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.730
You laugh, but somebody's gonna do you.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.942
-Ha ha! Ha ha, Freddie!
-Somebody's gonna do you, man!

36:05.496 --> 36:08.291
May 9, Mid-Hudson Correctional.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.293
Interview with Agent Tim Farrell.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.129
Dr. Robert Borgesian present.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.258
There's no boobytraps in it? I can use it?

36:17.592 --> 36:18.426
It's yours.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.180
So, we're done.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.348
We're done.

36:26.684 --> 36:27.518
Joyce.

36:27.602 --> 36:30.855
Irwin, what you told me before.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.775
I never suspected. Never knew.

36:36.527 --> 36:39.864
Anyway, if you ever--

36:42.200 --> 36:43.784
even if I go get married to Martha...

36:45.161 --> 36:46.370
Or we'll start a law firm.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.624
But if we do, no affair.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.334
Uh-uh, no matter what.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.837
My old mentor McReynolds always said,

36:55.296 --> 36:58.299
-"Your pens here, your pencils there."
-(laughs)

37:02.220 --> 37:04.722
You going to need Mr. Crespus tomorrow?

37:05.389 --> 37:06.891
Jury selection rest of the week.

37:08.142 --> 37:10.311
Okay, that ought to about do it.

37:11.479 --> 37:14.190
Irwin, you were terrific today

37:14.273 --> 37:17.109
-with that guy, the escaped prisoner.
-Oh, pshaw.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.168
Anyway...

37:36.087 --> 37:37.213
You're a good man, Irwin.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.008
I got to go up to Hill Street.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.804
It's none of my business, but, uh...

37:45.846 --> 37:46.806
I won't tell Frank.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.854
-Damn.
-What?

37:54.814 --> 37:55.690
His suits.

37:56.232 --> 37:58.484
Uh, Frank, Ray Calletano called.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.444
He said, "<i>Gracias, compaÃ±ero</i>."

38:00.528 --> 38:02.280
Is that what he said
or is that your translation?

38:02.363 --> 38:04.282
Actually, he said, "Tell Frank thanks."

38:05.116 --> 38:08.286
Uh, Captain, listen,
I got this robbery straightened out.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.955
-I'm notifying the headhunters.
-What the hell was going on?

38:11.789 --> 38:14.875
The burglar was feeding my snitch names.
Snitch was passing them on to me.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.127
And the burglar would then go in.

38:16.210 --> 38:18.546
Could we be a little more careful
with our snitches, Norman?

38:18.629 --> 38:20.381
Believe me, this guy is on probation.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.466
-Captain Furillo.
-Officer, come on in.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.344
I'll wait for IAD's verification
of findings.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.471
-If they close it, I'm satisfied.
-Okay.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.811
Mr. Weller came back, Tina.

38:33.894 --> 38:39.025
His client says you have a tattoo
of a butterfly on your right upper thigh.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.485
His client's quite a pig, isn't he?

38:41.902 --> 38:44.655
He also presented underwear

38:45.364 --> 38:48.576
and a bottle of hand lotion
which he claims are yours.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.078
Sounds desperate enough.

38:52.038 --> 38:52.997
Do you have that tattoo?

38:53.873 --> 38:54.707
Come on.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.793
You can tell me yourself,

38:58.919 --> 39:01.922
but if the answer is no,
I'm gonna have the matron verify.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.176
-Melvin.
<i>-Yes, Captain?</i>

39:05.259 --> 39:07.094
Could you locate Mrs. Bridge for me,
please?

39:07.178 --> 39:08.095
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

39:08.679 --> 39:10.014
This is getting a little weird.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.852
You said you didn't sleep
with Sonny Cappelito.

39:16.520 --> 39:20.066
The idea was for me
to go out with him, right?

39:22.902 --> 39:26.864
The idea was for me to turn him on enough

39:27.281 --> 39:28.491
that he would talk to me.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.701
Now everybody's shocked.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.787
"You didn't sleep with him?"

39:33.371 --> 39:34.622
I take it you did.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.415
Are you telling me, Captain,

39:36.707 --> 39:40.044
with all the women cops going undercover
to catch guys,

39:40.127 --> 39:41.879
that they never sleep with them?

39:41.962 --> 39:43.631
Is that your understanding?

39:44.173 --> 39:46.634
That they sleep with the suspects
and then lie about it?

39:46.717 --> 39:48.552
If it doesn't go to trial,
it doesn't come up.

39:49.136 --> 39:50.054
Answer me.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.264
I don't know what people do.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.350
Yes.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.811
Sure, of course they do.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.062
And that's what you were planning to do?

39:58.354 --> 40:00.731
-Do you want to hear this, Captain?
-I want the truth.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.527
Yes, I guess so.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.406
I want the case dismissed.

40:08.489 --> 40:11.492
Captain, this is the Amtrak burglary.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.661
Dismiss the case.
Get Cappelito out of here.

40:17.957 --> 40:18.833
What if I--

40:20.459 --> 40:23.379
I don't know, just tell the truth then?

40:24.171 --> 40:25.798
Lawyer asks, I say yeah.

40:26.173 --> 40:28.092
Sure, I slept with him. Why not?

40:28.175 --> 40:29.927
So what? What was I supposed to do?

40:30.302 --> 40:32.972
Did you ever have a case go to jury trial?

40:33.764 --> 40:34.598
No.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.518
Then you don't have any real idea

40:37.601 --> 40:40.771
how a lawyer can put a policeman on trial
instead of his client.

40:41.188 --> 40:42.148
Not exactly.

40:42.231 --> 40:44.358
Do you have any notion
what a jury would think

40:44.442 --> 40:46.444
of a cop who slept with the defendant?

40:46.527 --> 40:48.779
Maybe they'd just think
at least she's honest.

40:48.863 --> 40:53.075
For openers, they'd think she's a cop
who went against policy.

40:53.617 --> 40:56.370
They'd think she's a cop
who violated regulations.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.998
She cut one corner,
maybe she cut a lot of others.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.333
Captain Furillo,
I'm just trying to do what you said.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.627
-I thought you said to tell the truth.
-Kick him.

41:03.711 --> 41:04.545
That's all I want.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.133
And your report on my desk by 9:00 a.m.

41:11.635 --> 41:12.720
(door slams)

41:17.808 --> 41:21.228
Norman, I have received a death threat.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.481
Not from me, you haven't.
I'm typing mine up now.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.150
Come on, Norman. Look at it.

41:30.571 --> 41:31.989
Found it under my door.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.326
I-- Norman-- Norm--

41:36.452 --> 41:37.995
Can we talk privately, please?

41:38.078 --> 41:39.163
(sighs)

41:43.167 --> 41:46.712
-(toilet flushes)
-So what do you want, a bus ticket?

41:46.795 --> 41:48.631
No, I don't want a bus ticket.

41:48.714 --> 41:51.425
I like this town.
I like this line of work.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.928
Which, by the way,
I happen to think I'm quite good at.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.681
I'm just asking
for a little protective custody.

41:57.765 --> 42:00.351
-So how about Michigan Avenue?
-Oh, ha, ha.

42:00.434 --> 42:02.019
I could stroke out laughing, Norm.

42:02.102 --> 42:04.396
Come on, Sid, one lousy death threat, huh.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.524
I mean, these guys that got robbed
are low rent.

42:06.607 --> 42:09.193
They ain't gonna off you.
I'll send a patrol by your house.

42:09.276 --> 42:12.780
Oh, great. And that's not gonna point
a big floppy pointer

42:12.863 --> 42:14.782
-right at yours truly?
-So what the hell do you want, huh?

42:15.783 --> 42:19.411
Norman, I need 24-hour,
around-the-clock protection.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.996
Yeah, well, how you gonna get it?

42:21.455 --> 42:25.417
Well, I was thinking on a temporary basis,
of course,

42:26.252 --> 42:27.378
I could move in with you, Norman.

42:29.797 --> 42:32.341
-Move in with me?
-Yeah.

42:32.716 --> 42:35.719
Get 'em while they're hot.
Exploits of Robert Hill.

42:36.178 --> 42:38.222
-What page?
-Don't know, I haven't looked yet.

42:39.139 --> 42:40.933
Right, you got it.

42:41.433 --> 42:44.979
Bite of Bengal, 8:30.

42:45.187 --> 42:46.021
Okay.

42:47.189 --> 42:48.107
Nice hotel.

42:49.358 --> 42:52.069
In one day
he gets his manuscript rejected,

42:52.152 --> 42:53.946
then he gets robbed of all his dough.

42:54.029 --> 42:57.408
And I still look at him and think
he's the one who took the right path.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.159
And he thinks everything
he's done is wrong.

42:59.243 --> 43:02.079
I mean, he gets robbed,
he thinks it's his fault.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.914
He's not a Jewish fella, is he, Henry?

43:04.331 --> 43:05.624
No, Howard, he isn't.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.837
Cappelito's gone. He's history.

43:10.337 --> 43:11.171
We'll get him again.

43:11.797 --> 43:14.174
Do you want me to transfer, Captain?
You want me to quit?

43:14.758 --> 43:17.177
Uh, to be honest,
I'm not sure where you're headed.

43:17.261 --> 43:19.013
For now, I just want your report
on my desk.

43:19.096 --> 43:20.180
Because I don't know
if I can work for you.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.350
I don't know if you can either.

43:25.352 --> 43:26.854
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

43:27.688 --> 43:28.522
Tina.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.401
My opinion, minimum,

43:33.068 --> 43:34.903
you're pretty inexperienced in some areas.

43:34.987 --> 43:35.821
Maybe.

43:36.488 --> 43:37.615
But I'm not a hypocrite.

43:38.490 --> 43:41.160
The department set me up to use my sex.

43:41.660 --> 43:44.622
And then when I use it, you all freak.

43:49.793 --> 43:52.087
I cannot believe that a story
as big as this one

43:52.171 --> 43:54.840
where a police officer or any individual
catches a little baby

43:54.923 --> 43:57.092
falling out of a high window
and saves the baby's life

43:57.176 --> 43:59.678
but don't have nothing more
than two columns about it

43:59.762 --> 44:02.056
at the bottom of page 37.
What am I gonna do about that?

44:02.139 --> 44:03.724
Probably because
you didn't have a picture.

44:03.807 --> 44:06.477
(chuckles) Gonna start
carrying a Polaroid in the unit.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.396
Tell me about it.
I captured an escaped con today.

44:10.105 --> 44:13.359
Nice going. Bring your memo book
and all accompanying paperwork tomorrow.

44:14.610 --> 44:16.570
-Irwin.
-Frank.

44:17.029 --> 44:18.822
-You and Joyce done?
-Done.

44:19.239 --> 44:20.824
I'll be there till midnight,
but she's done.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.660
Frank, Joyce called
while you were downstairs.

44:22.743 --> 44:23.827
Kiyoto at 7:00 is fine.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.789
And you got taken to the cleaners,
but don't panic.

44:36.590 --> 44:39.885
Norm, the captain's looking a little
country club there, isn't he?

44:40.427 --> 44:43.555
Guy's good at what he does.
But he dresses like a real loser.

44:44.181 --> 44:45.015
Come on.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.425
Look, we're gonna have one rule,
all right?

45:20.259 --> 45:24.346
You feel the need to pass any gas,
you go out in the public corridor.

45:28.642 --> 45:29.893
-Hi.
-Hi.

45:30.644 --> 45:31.895
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's okay.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.897
-What was that message?
-Here.

45:38.277 --> 45:42.156
A suit? Two suits?
What is it, my birthday?

45:42.656 --> 45:43.824
From McCauley's. Not bad.

45:44.199 --> 45:47.786
Frank, remember just after we met,
something that happened?

45:49.121 --> 45:50.080
Something that happened?

45:51.039 --> 45:53.417
To your suits. With the dry cleaners.

45:53.500 --> 45:54.835
Four of your suits were burned.

45:55.627 --> 45:57.171
Uh-huh, sure.

45:58.213 --> 45:59.256
This time, all of them.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.760
-All my suits?
-Except these two.

46:05.095 --> 46:08.015
Well, they were stained anyway.

46:08.098 --> 46:09.099
(laughs)

46:10.017 --> 46:10.851
How was your day?

46:11.685 --> 46:14.062
Fine. Irwin caught a crook.

46:15.522 --> 46:16.607
And we're finished.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.531
IRWIN:<i> I live a crooked life.</i>

46:25.783 --> 46:27.785
<i>My body goes in one direction,</i>

46:28.660 --> 46:29.620
<i>my heart another.</i>

46:30.704 --> 46:33.499
<i>Joyce, I hope in a longer life to come,</i>

46:34.333 --> 46:35.375
<i>we're much closer.</i>

46:36.794 --> 46:37.961
(chuckles) If not sooner.

46:49.431 --> 46:50.390
Larry Bird.

46:51.517 --> 46:52.851
-(thumps)
-Swish.

46:53.519 --> 46:54.353
Three-pointer.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.105
(phone rings)

46:57.189 --> 46:58.023
Hello.

47:01.443 --> 47:02.277
Hi, Martha.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.613
(indistinct chatter)

47:05.739 --> 47:07.950
(siren wailing)

47:11.328 --> 47:14.122
(indistinct radio chatter)

47:16.166 --> 47:18.544
Sorry, Stan Williams was coming.

47:18.627 --> 47:19.837
I wanted you to be here.

47:20.337 --> 47:22.297
-It is racist.
-What happened?

47:22.381 --> 47:25.259
Mahoney and Grich
failed to backup Brown and Freeman.

47:25.342 --> 47:26.385
Freeman got shot.

47:30.138 --> 47:31.306
Nobody backed him up.

47:31.390 --> 47:32.975
You tried to get me killed, sucker!

47:34.476 --> 47:36.019
Hold it, Brown! Hold it!

47:37.896 --> 47:39.189
Hey, stop it!

47:40.148 --> 47:40.983
Stop it!

47:42.025 --> 47:44.278
(clamoring)

47:47.531 --> 47:48.532
It's all blowing up.

47:51.201 --> 47:52.035
Stop it!

47:54.121 --> 47:54.955
(punches landing)

48:02.671 --> 48:05.674
(closing theme playing)
