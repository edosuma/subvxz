00:34.300 --> 00:36.336
It looks like we had
some good wind events...

00:36.403 --> 00:37.904
but it doesn't look too bad.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.860
That would point more towards...

01:00.927 --> 01:02.128
human interaction.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.742
Lots of tracks.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.373
Should be a bunny somewhere.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.244
Every time I go out with a gun,

20:45.544 --> 20:48.247
I rarely get to see bunnies.

20:48.313 --> 20:49.681
But, when I leave my gun at home,

20:49.748 --> 20:53.085
man I see tons of them.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.420
Of all kinds of animals.

20:56.154 --> 20:59.291
They just spread the word,
you got a gun. I joke.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.166
I don't think these willows
are dense enough.

21:08.634 --> 21:12.004
Unless I walk along the top.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.773
I think I should do that.

21:26.318 --> 21:28.253
This is where the bunnies are.

22:12.097 --> 22:13.799
Running as fast as it can.

22:17.202 --> 22:18.570
Shucks.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.375
Damn it.

22:41.326 --> 22:42.527
No blood.

22:44.062 --> 22:45.697
No rabbit.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.236
I don't want to wound one.

22:53.338 --> 22:56.074
That's bad luck for hunting
if you wound one and then leave it.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.377
They say you won't catch...

22:58.777 --> 23:01.146
for the next couple years.

23:40.685 --> 23:43.155
One down, more to go.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.467
This should be enough for now.

24:32.604 --> 24:33.805
Nice rabbit.

24:58.296 --> 24:59.698
It was a good shot.

46:10.868 --> 46:11.735
Sled.

46:17.040 --> 46:17.941
There!

47:05.389 --> 47:07.391
