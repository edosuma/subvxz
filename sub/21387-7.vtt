WEBVTT

00:03.606 --> 00:05.565
It's my ho-tation.
I make the rules.

00:05.565 --> 00:08.231
I don't want your conversation.
Get in my line up.

00:08.231 --> 00:10.398
Girl, that's the ho spirit.

00:11.231 --> 00:12.189
What do you guys do?

00:12.398 --> 00:13.939
We give you all the tools
you need to succeed.

00:13.939 --> 00:16.398
-What the--? Come on, y'all!
-Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:16.398 --> 00:17.523
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

00:17.981 --> 00:19.440
-Woot Woot's dead.
-(SIGHS)

00:19.440 --> 00:21.647
It had been a part of my life
for so long.

00:21.647 --> 00:24.440
Sometimes saying goodbye
means you're making room
for something better.

00:25.064 --> 00:27.606
This whole open thing
sounds super messy.

00:27.606 --> 00:29.023
We could keep talking
about this,

00:29.023 --> 00:30.023
or choose to be in it.

00:30.565 --> 00:33.064
LAWRENCE: Can't believe Issa's
still out here seeing this dude.

00:33.064 --> 00:34.440
This ain't all on Issa.

00:36.606 --> 00:37.440
(MOANS)

00:37.939 --> 00:40.231
What the fuck?! Did you really
just do that in my fucking face?

00:40.231 --> 00:41.606
Weren't you into it.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.772
Molly on phone:
In your face?!
Nah, nigga.

00:50.772 --> 00:52.565
- Nah!
- I know.

00:52.565 --> 00:55.315
Okay, you know what?
We gonna go to that
nigga's house

00:55.315 --> 00:57.356
and we are
fucking him up
on sight.

00:57.356 --> 00:59.523
Girl, I don't
even wanna see him.
It's just not even--

00:59.523 --> 01:01.481
Girl, you don't
have to go.
I'll go.

01:01.481 --> 01:03.273
I'ma put a dozen eggs
in a water gun,

01:03.273 --> 01:05.106
we gonna roll up
to that nigga's house,

01:05.106 --> 01:06.939
and just-- brrr--
I'ma spray his face
with cum eggs.

01:06.939 --> 01:09.772
As much as I love
that visual, I just--

01:09.772 --> 01:12.148
ugh, I don't know,
like, I just--

01:12.148 --> 01:14.189
I'm embarrassed.
I let him embarrass me.

01:14.189 --> 01:16.440
Like, I was just
trying to show him
he was special to me

01:16.440 --> 01:19.772
and then he just
made me feel stupid.

01:19.772 --> 01:21.440
No, girl,
you not stupid, okay?

01:21.440 --> 01:22.856
He was being
disrespectful.

01:22.856 --> 01:24.398
Niggas is out here
watching Pornhub,

01:24.398 --> 01:26.231
thinking they can do
that shit in real life.

01:26.231 --> 01:28.939
Yeah, well,
thanks for not
judging me, girl.

01:28.939 --> 01:31.606
( sighs )

01:31.606 --> 01:35.856
But since we out here
not judging people...

01:35.856 --> 01:37.772
What?

01:39.814 --> 01:41.315
I'm still seeing Dro.

01:41.315 --> 01:43.023
Wait, what?

01:43.023 --> 01:44.897
But I thought you said
it was one and done?

01:44.897 --> 01:47.356
Tsk, I mean,
it's been more like

01:47.356 --> 01:49.481
17 and not stopping
no time soon.

01:49.481 --> 01:51.064
So, y'all are
having an affair?

01:51.064 --> 01:53.064
Girl, no.
You know their situation.

01:53.064 --> 01:54.440
I mean, you was
the one who said

01:54.440 --> 01:56.814
them being open was better
than sneaking around.

01:56.814 --> 01:59.356
Yeah, better
for Dro and Candice.
But what about you?

01:59.356 --> 02:01.856
- Like, where is this going?
- I don't know.

02:01.856 --> 02:02.981
That's the point.

02:04.356 --> 02:05.856
I guess.

02:05.856 --> 02:07.606
Hold up, okay?

02:07.606 --> 02:10.189
I didn't judge you
for hoing around these
last few months.

02:10.189 --> 02:12.023
Oh, that was
different, okay,

02:12.023 --> 02:13.523
'cause I knew what I was
getting myself into.

02:13.523 --> 02:15.647
Bitch, you just got
a surprise facial.

02:15.647 --> 02:17.398
- What the fuck
you talking about?
- Really?

02:20.523 --> 02:22.731
Malibu, I'm just
trying to look out.

02:22.731 --> 02:24.023
And I appreciate that.

02:24.023 --> 02:26.356
Malibu,
why don't you do you,

02:26.356 --> 02:27.981
and I'ma do me?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.398
( muttering )
Fine. You wanna do you,
that's just fine.

02:30.398 --> 02:32.064
I don't have a dog

about the PSAT is it's
multiple choice.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.273
You could close your eyes
and fill out anything

03:08.273 --> 03:10.273
and still have
a good shot.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.231
Don't do that, though.
You'll fail.

03:15.315 --> 03:18.565
You know, We Got Y'all
offers PSAT tutoring.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.481
You should
come through.

03:20.481 --> 03:24.231
I tried to, but Mr. Gaines
told me and my friends
the program is full.

03:29.606 --> 03:31.064
( both laughing )

03:31.064 --> 03:33.731
- Hey, y'all.
What's up?
- All: Hey!

03:37.606 --> 03:39.189
Corn maze was epic.

03:39.189 --> 03:40.606
You guys
missed out.

03:40.606 --> 03:43.523
Ah, yeah.
Gotta blame
my allergies, man.

03:43.523 --> 03:47.356
- What'd you end up doing?
- Just, uh, kicked it
at the house.

03:47.356 --> 03:51.315
Oh, Aparna said
you went to that theater
where the seats move.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.939
Uh, oh, yeah.

03:53.939 --> 03:55.023
Yeah, we did.

03:55.023 --> 03:57.481
Wait, are you guys
a thing?

03:57.481 --> 04:00.273
No, we just, uh--
you know, we just hung out.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.856
Yep, that's
what I said.

04:06.106 --> 04:08.523
- How have I never had this?
- Look, why don't you
just try it?

04:08.523 --> 04:10.731
It's buttery ranch
and caramel crisp.

04:10.731 --> 04:12.023
Just trust me.

04:15.148 --> 04:17.148
- Oh, shit.
- ( chuckles )

04:17.148 --> 04:19.189
- Okay. Mm!
- Yeah, I told you.
That's right.

04:19.189 --> 04:21.565
Look, I'll get you
a tub of it once you get
that big raise.

04:21.565 --> 04:22.814
- ( chuckles )
- Hmm.

04:22.814 --> 04:24.023
So, when is your
white boy meeting?

04:24.023 --> 04:25.481
First thing tomorrow.

04:25.481 --> 04:27.731
- Man, I am so ready.
- Well, good luck.

04:27.731 --> 04:29.481
I really hope they know
what they got.

04:29.481 --> 04:31.273
Oh, yeah?
What they got?

04:31.273 --> 04:33.148
- You know what they got.
- ( both chuckling )

04:33.148 --> 04:35.023
Well, look,
I'ma be in LA
in a few weeks.

04:35.023 --> 04:37.189
Really?
You trying
to take my job?

04:37.189 --> 04:39.731
Or maybe I want you
to take me out.

04:39.731 --> 04:41.231
You know,
just show me around.

04:43.897 --> 04:45.231
M'kay.

04:45.231 --> 04:47.189
- ( chatter )
- Hey.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.814
So, earlier?

04:51.814 --> 04:53.939
It's cool.

04:53.939 --> 04:56.481
You know,
I guess I, uh--

04:56.481 --> 04:58.315
I just didn't want people
in our business like that.

04:58.315 --> 04:59.897
Do we have business?

05:02.023 --> 05:05.440
It's just
I've made mistakes

05:05.440 --> 05:07.523
jumping into something
too fast before.

05:07.523 --> 05:09.231
And I don't wanna
do that with you.

05:09.231 --> 05:11.064
I get it.

05:11.064 --> 05:13.064
We still on for drinks
at that new bar tomorrow?

05:13.064 --> 05:16.231
Shh, can you keep it down?
Somebody will hear you.

05:16.231 --> 05:17.897
- I'm just kidding.
- ( chuckles )

05:17.897 --> 05:20.606
- We're gonna
drink everything.
- You got jokes.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.814
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

05:25.814 --> 05:28.023
Can we talk?

05:28.023 --> 05:30.523
I mean,
I'm pretty busy

05:30.523 --> 05:33.981
with some
computer stuff.

05:33.981 --> 05:36.023
Well, I just wanted
to show you this.

05:36.023 --> 05:37.814
They're some ideas
I had

05:37.814 --> 05:40.565
to increase
Latino enrollment
at East 41st Street,

05:40.565 --> 05:42.398
to show them
we're available to them.

05:42.398 --> 05:44.231
Oh.

05:44.231 --> 05:45.606
Okay.

05:50.064 --> 05:51.273
What?

05:53.481 --> 05:55.231
I had
the same thought.

05:55.231 --> 05:58.606
It was part of
this whole initiative,
but...

05:58.606 --> 06:00.897
- this is great.
- Thanks.

06:00.897 --> 06:04.856
God, even when
we're fighting,
we are still synced,

06:04.856 --> 06:07.856
- mentally, physically.
- That's... too much.

06:07.856 --> 06:09.939
No, you're right,
and I didn't mean it
that way.

06:11.856 --> 06:13.939
Can I ask where
this is this coming from?

06:13.939 --> 06:16.606
Uh...

06:16.606 --> 06:22.023
honestly, I was
in a weird place
for a minute, you know,

06:22.023 --> 06:24.440
and kind of got away
from myself and...

06:24.440 --> 06:26.772
lost in the heat
of it all.

06:26.772 --> 06:30.106
And you were right

06:30.106 --> 06:33.106
and I'm sorry.

06:33.106 --> 06:34.897
I get it.

06:34.897 --> 06:37.565
And I'm sorry about earlier.
I was being a real bitch.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.981
"Oh, hey."
Like, what was that?

06:39.981 --> 06:41.481
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:45.315 --> 06:46.897
Want these back?

06:46.897 --> 06:48.647
No, you can
hold on to those.

06:48.647 --> 06:50.689
- Okay. How was Chicago?
- Oh, it was great.

06:50.689 --> 06:52.148
- Yeah?
- I got you something.

06:52.148 --> 06:52.981
Oh.

06:54.148 --> 06:56.064
( humming )

06:56.064 --> 06:59.647
All right.
"Buttery ranch
caramel crisp."

06:59.647 --> 07:03.023
- Mm, mm-mm.
- Oh, just trust me.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.647
Okay, see what
we got here.

07:08.189 --> 07:10.231
- Uh-huh, okay.
- M'kay.

07:10.231 --> 07:12.106
- Damn.
- I be knowing.

07:12.106 --> 07:14.148
You get Tiffany's invite
to Derek's birthday party?

07:14.148 --> 07:16.148
Ugh, a style guide,
though?

07:16.148 --> 07:19.981
And she had the nerve
to suggest me and Candice
mind the color palette?

07:19.981 --> 07:22.731
Oh, Candice
is coming.

07:22.731 --> 07:25.523
I mean,
I figured, but...

07:25.523 --> 07:27.315
- ( sighs )
- You okay?

07:28.939 --> 07:31.856
Mm-hmm, yeah.

07:31.856 --> 07:34.064
Molly.

07:34.064 --> 07:37.231
It's cool,
it's just,

07:37.231 --> 07:40.565
you know, I haven't
seen her since we...

07:40.565 --> 07:42.315
Oh, yeah,
I get it.

07:44.148 --> 07:46.440
Look...
( clears throat )

07:46.440 --> 07:48.731
I know
what we have is new,

07:48.731 --> 07:52.481
but we're
still us, okay?

07:54.856 --> 07:56.440
- M'kay.

Molly:
And earlier this year,

09:10.939 --> 09:13.689
I signed another Fortune 100
telecommunications company.

09:13.689 --> 09:16.440
This one client
has the potential
to generate

09:16.440 --> 09:19.481
upwards of $2 million alone
in its first year.

09:19.481 --> 09:21.148
Wait, wasn't Hannah
on Marist?

09:21.148 --> 09:23.939
She was.
That's one of the files
I inherited when she left.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.273
So, whether it's covering
for Hannah's transfer

09:26.273 --> 09:29.106
or just a fellow associate
who has other plans,

09:29.106 --> 09:30.939
I am always happy
to step up.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.814
I think we all agree
you're a huge asset
to the firm.

09:35.814 --> 09:37.148
Thank you.

09:37.148 --> 09:40.565
However, it is unusual
to start negotiations

09:40.565 --> 09:42.398
so far ahead
of your annual review.

09:42.398 --> 09:44.897
Right, but given
when Grayson and McKinney

09:44.897 --> 09:46.481
were promoted to partner,

09:46.481 --> 09:49.106
this firm has demonstrated
that it is not bound to timing

09:49.106 --> 09:51.148
when it comes
to recognizing hard work.

09:51.148 --> 09:53.523
We hear you.
We really do.

09:53.523 --> 09:55.939
And when your review
comes around next year,

09:55.939 --> 09:58.273
all of this
will be very useful.

10:01.981 --> 10:03.939
We'll have space.

10:03.939 --> 10:05.647
Will you have one?
Okay, great.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.689
Hi.
Tell your parents.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.689
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

10:08.689 --> 10:10.647
Mr. Gaines,
do you have a second?

10:10.647 --> 10:12.315
Yeah, make it quick.

10:12.315 --> 10:14.981
Pot pie gave
half the ninth grade
food poisoning.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.523
There goes my mop budget.

10:16.523 --> 10:18.273
Sure.

10:18.273 --> 10:21.606
I realize I've been negligent
in how I presented myself.

10:21.606 --> 10:23.315
Negligent?
What do you mean?

10:23.315 --> 10:26.356
Well, We Got Y'all
is inclusive of everyone,

10:26.356 --> 10:29.398
and I might have
made it seem like that
wasn't important to me, but--

10:29.398 --> 10:32.231
Is your program full?
Are you helping the youth?

10:32.231 --> 10:33.856
- Yeah, but--
- Then what's the problem?

10:33.856 --> 10:36.064
Look, I thought me and you
had an understanding.

10:36.064 --> 10:38.315
Now you're coming at me
on some All Lives Matter?

10:38.315 --> 10:40.523
- It's not--
- I'm sorry.

10:40.523 --> 10:42.106
We were just hoping
for a more

10:42.106 --> 10:45.398
representative
group of kids.

10:45.398 --> 10:48.356
Look, if you want Mexicans,
nobody's stopping you.

10:50.064 --> 10:53.148
You're turning away
Latino students.

10:53.148 --> 10:56.356
They deserve to have
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.440
These are kids.

11:00.731 --> 11:03.023
( laughing )

11:03.023 --> 11:06.481
Girl, calm down.
Ain't nobody dead.

11:06.481 --> 11:07.856
Okay, go, man.

11:10.231 --> 11:12.481
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

11:12.481 --> 11:14.398
Yo, I know we said we were
gonna grab drinks at 7:00,

11:14.398 --> 11:15.939
- but would 10:00 work?
- What's up?

11:15.939 --> 11:18.565
I forgot I gotta
stop by this thing.

11:18.565 --> 11:19.856
Oh, a thing.

11:19.856 --> 11:21.148
Is this at a place?

11:21.148 --> 11:23.356
It's a birthday party.

11:23.356 --> 11:24.731
I'm just gonna
swing through.

11:26.939 --> 11:29.231
My ex is supposed
to be there.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.981
Oh.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.356
Yeah.

11:32.356 --> 11:34.189
Maybe we could try
another night.

11:34.189 --> 11:36.523
Or I can go with you
if that's easier.

11:36.523 --> 11:39.231
Uh... sure.

11:42.856 --> 11:44.772
Mm, my bad.

11:45.981 --> 11:48.148
( phone buzzing )

11:54.273 --> 11:55.772
What do you want?

11:55.772 --> 11:58.398
I was hoping
we could talk.

11:58.398 --> 12:00.856
And I just wanted
to apologize

12:00.856 --> 12:02.606
so we can move past this.

12:02.606 --> 12:04.689
Apologize?

12:04.689 --> 12:06.856
That was fucked up.
You're fucked up.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.939
I just got caught up
in the moment.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.189
You embarrassed me.

12:15.398 --> 12:17.939
And it's me.
Like, why would
you even do that?

12:17.939 --> 12:21.772
You right.
Like, it was fucked up.

12:21.772 --> 12:23.148
It was fucked up.

12:26.189 --> 12:27.689
Can you forgive me?

12:29.148 --> 12:30.897
Please?

12:30.897 --> 12:35.315
IIIIssss, pleeeease?

12:35.315 --> 12:37.647
Shut up.

12:37.647 --> 12:38.981
I hate you.

12:42.148 --> 12:44.481
Why our shit
always gotta be so messy?

12:44.481 --> 12:45.856
You got me.

12:48.856 --> 12:52.981
But, I mean,
I guess we're even now.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.731
Even?

12:54.731 --> 12:56.148
Yeah, it's like,
you know,

12:56.148 --> 12:58.189
we both did
some fuck shit,
you know?

12:58.189 --> 13:01.273
Wait, what?

13:01.273 --> 13:02.772
So you're--

13:02.772 --> 13:05.023
you're saying you were
trying to get back at me?

13:05.023 --> 13:07.189
- What? No. What?
- Wait, wait, wait.

13:07.189 --> 13:08.523
So, you did this
on purpose,

13:08.523 --> 13:10.064
like on some fucked-up
revenge shit?

13:10.064 --> 13:11.981
Listen, it's not even
that deep, all right?

13:11.981 --> 13:14.856
I'm just sayin',
like, now you--

13:14.856 --> 13:15.897
now you know how I felt.

13:17.273 --> 13:20.189
You disrespectful,
petty-ass nigga.

13:20.189 --> 13:21.856
- Hey, hold on, you just--
- You know what?

13:21.856 --> 13:24.398

It's a women's jacket,

13:45.440 --> 13:47.356
Okay, so Derek
doesn't know this,

13:47.356 --> 13:49.565
but I got him a box
of high-end Cuban cigars.

13:49.565 --> 13:51.315
They're rolled
by this entire family,

13:51.315 --> 13:52.731
even the children.

13:52.731 --> 13:55.315
I know it sounds sketchy,

I love my man.

14:01.565 --> 14:03.731
- ( snickers )
- Vance: Signature cocktail?

14:03.731 --> 14:05.606
You can choose
from the Tiffany,

14:05.606 --> 14:08.064
which is a sparkling rosé
with muddled raspberries
and a hint of vermouth,

14:08.064 --> 14:10.565
or the Derek,
which is our take
on the amaretto sour.

14:10.565 --> 14:13.356
- What's your take?
- He added an extra cherry.

14:13.356 --> 14:16.565
- I'm gonna go check
on the app situation.
- Okay.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.772
Mm! I thought Sweetie
was just gonna be
some strange,

14:19.772 --> 14:22.023
but I'm going
with his parents
to mosque next week.

14:22.023 --> 14:23.689
Shabbat shalom!

14:23.689 --> 14:25.440
That's not
what they say
at mosque.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.606
It could be.

14:26.606 --> 14:28.064
Sweetie:
Hey, babe!

14:28.064 --> 14:30.023
They got shumai shooters.

14:30.023 --> 14:32.772
He a real one.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.356
Candice:
Mwah! Yes, yes, yes.

14:34.356 --> 14:36.231
- Hi! I'm Candice.
- Congratulations.

14:36.231 --> 14:38.731
- Tamika.
- Nice to meet you.

14:38.731 --> 14:41.064
( laughing )

14:42.106 --> 14:44.231
( speaking Spanish )

14:46.064 --> 14:47.939
I did.

14:47.939 --> 14:49.023
Hey, Molly.

14:49.023 --> 14:50.565
Good to see you.

14:50.565 --> 14:51.981
Hi, Candice!

14:51.981 --> 14:54.064
Come here,
give me a hug!

14:54.064 --> 14:55.064
( drink spills )

14:55.064 --> 14:56.231
- Oh!
- Sorry!

14:56.231 --> 14:57.606
- Did I--
- No, no, no, it's fine.

14:57.606 --> 14:58.606
I'll get you
another one.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.315
Okay.
All right.

15:00.315 --> 15:01.647
( chuckles )

15:03.481 --> 15:05.689
This place is nice.

15:05.689 --> 15:07.315
Yeah.

15:08.981 --> 15:10.606
Spacious.

15:12.939 --> 15:14.647
( chattering,
laughing )

15:16.897 --> 15:19.356
Doesn't the bartender
look just like Cory Booker?

15:19.356 --> 15:22.856
Oh, my God.
I thought so, too.

15:22.856 --> 15:24.231
You know,
I can't trust anyone

15:24.231 --> 15:25.981
who lives
in a housing project
on purpose.

15:25.981 --> 15:27.814
- I know, right?
- ( laughs )

15:27.814 --> 15:30.106
- ( Candice laughs )
- Here's your drink.

15:32.106 --> 15:33.647
Dinner commences.

15:33.647 --> 15:35.481
- Kelli:
But you eat pork, right?
- Absolutely, I do.

15:35.481 --> 15:37.315
Molly:
Thank you.

15:37.315 --> 15:39.106
Kelli:
Thank you, Sweetie.

15:39.106 --> 15:42.981
Molly,
there are place cards.

15:42.981 --> 15:44.023
I didn't design
my own font

15:44.023 --> 15:46.939
so you could sit
just where you wanted.

15:46.939 --> 15:48.856
- Okay. I'ma just--
- Thank you, babe.

15:48.856 --> 15:50.064
- ( music playing )
- ( laughter )

15:50.064 --> 15:51.523
So, you gonna go off
on Lawrence?

15:51.523 --> 15:52.939
No. This is
Derek's birthday,

15:52.939 --> 15:55.148
and I'm not here
to start drama.

15:55.148 --> 15:58.356
- I'm fine.
- Yeah? Shit, we're drinking
everything tonight.

15:58.356 --> 16:00.148
( chatter )

16:00.148 --> 16:01.523
Signature cocktail?

16:01.523 --> 16:03.064
There's the Tiffany
and the Derek.

16:03.064 --> 16:04.856
I'll take both
'cause I'm classy.

16:04.856 --> 16:06.315
I'll have a club soda.

16:08.356 --> 16:09.647
Hey!

16:09.647 --> 16:12.939
- Happy birthday.
- Mwah. Thank you for coming.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.023
( chuckling )

16:15.023 --> 16:17.856
( chatter )

16:17.856 --> 16:20.189
- Candice: Hey.
- Oh, Candice, hey!

16:22.106 --> 16:23.731
How's your night going?

16:23.731 --> 16:26.356
Great. Yours?

16:26.356 --> 16:27.398
Great.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.772
- What's up with y'all?
- Nothing. We're fine.
She grown.

16:35.148 --> 16:37.897
No, this nigga didn't.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.356
- Did you know he was
bringing this one?
- No.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.856
Hey, uh...

16:43.856 --> 16:46.356
Um, I didn't realize
it was a...

16:46.356 --> 16:49.231
sit-down dinner
type of situation.

16:49.231 --> 16:51.565
It's fine.
It's fine.

16:51.565 --> 16:54.897
( stammers )
Whatever. It's fine.

16:54.897 --> 16:56.565
Let me get
another chair.

16:57.981 --> 17:00.398
- We could just go.
- It's whatever you want.

17:00.398 --> 17:01.772
Derek:
Put you
right over here.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.606
Starving.

17:06.897 --> 17:09.481
There must've been
a sale on denim.

17:09.481 --> 17:11.106
Can we all
just scoot down
just a little bit?

17:11.106 --> 17:12.772
Oh, no, that's fine.
It's okay.

17:12.772 --> 17:14.440
No, it's all good.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.981
( dishes clattering )

17:19.064 --> 17:21.897
No, Kelli,
that's Derek's fork.

17:21.897 --> 17:23.440
Nope, still Derek's.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.231
I got eight forks,
so it don't even
fuckin' matter.

17:33.481 --> 17:34.814
( sighs )

17:37.273 --> 17:38.772
Everybody,
this is Aparna.

17:40.772 --> 17:42.398
Or you could call me
"random girl

17:42.398 --> 17:43.897
who showed up
to Derek's birthday."

17:43.897 --> 17:47.356
( polite laughter )

17:47.356 --> 17:49.731
Oh... ahem!

17:49.731 --> 17:50.856
Can I get a whiskey?

17:50.856 --> 17:52.981
Oh, so we drinkin' now?

17:52.981 --> 17:54.689
I didn't like neither one
of their cocktails,

17:54.689 --> 17:55.856
so I mixed them together.

17:55.856 --> 17:57.148
I call it a Derffanny.

17:57.148 --> 17:58.856
It's like them
fuckin' in a glass.

17:58.856 --> 18:00.315

what Abramovic did
was really moving.

18:09.315 --> 18:11.731
She's just sitting there
staring at you, and it's art?

18:11.731 --> 18:13.273
- Oh!
- I'm with you, Tiff.

18:13.273 --> 18:16.064
It's like, paint,
breakdance, do something.

18:16.064 --> 18:17.606
Hey, have you guys
been to the--

18:17.606 --> 18:20.064
What about--
what's that room
called at The Broad?

18:20.064 --> 18:21.315
Can you pass

18:27.481 --> 18:29.772
You're saying
the one with the lights?

18:29.772 --> 18:31.064
The Infinity Room.

18:31.064 --> 18:32.106
It's all black.

18:32.106 --> 18:33.523
The, uh, Infinity Room.

18:33.523 --> 18:35.356
Tiffany:
Yes!

18:35.356 --> 18:36.689
I went to the car museum
on Wilshire.

18:36.689 --> 18:37.856
You know Biggie
got shot there?

18:37.856 --> 18:39.565
No. No, I didn't.

18:39.565 --> 18:41.481
I didn't know he died
until recently.

18:41.481 --> 18:43.565
So, how do you guys
know Tiffany and Derek?

18:44.939 --> 18:46.356
Just, uh...

18:46.356 --> 18:48.148
yeah, we're friends
from back in the day.

18:48.148 --> 18:49.647
Oh, you all grew up
together, or...?

18:49.647 --> 18:52.440
My ex went to college
with them.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.189
Oh, that's cool.
You two are still friends?

I'm just saying, yeah,
Inglewood's on the come-up.

19:10.189 --> 19:12.273
We're thinking about buying
a fourplex out there.

19:12.273 --> 19:15.356
Nothing fancy,
but we have our eye
on a couple foreclosures.

19:15.356 --> 19:17.064
Fingers crossed
the owners lose it.

19:17.064 --> 19:18.440
