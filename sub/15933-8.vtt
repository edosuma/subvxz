WEBVTT

00:54.597 --> 00:57.934
DEATH TO ESCOBAR

00:58.768 --> 01:00.311
Forgive me.

01:02.981 --> 01:07.068
Children and innocent people
died in that bombing.

01:07.152 --> 01:10.822
That was an act of pure terrorism.
It must be answered for.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.491
<i>Surrender, unconditionally, now.</i>

01:13.575 --> 01:18.329
What kind of country is it
when a death squad is not only tolerated

01:18.455 --> 01:21.082
<i>but is actually sanctioned
by the goddamn government?</i>

01:21.166 --> 01:24.002
Do you want to see Bogotá
turned into a crater?

01:24.127 --> 01:29.591
Is that what it will take to protect
my family from those bastards, Los Pepes?

01:29.674 --> 01:34.012
No. Your family's safety
is our utmost concern.

01:35.013 --> 01:39.768
They're simply... in protective custody.

01:39.851 --> 01:43.438
Get my family out of Colombia.

01:43.521 --> 01:46.524
We can get your family out of Colombia.

01:47.108 --> 01:53.364
But I can't guarantee any country
will accept them.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.451
I don't have that kind of power.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.954
You better find that kind of power,

02:00.038 --> 02:04.709
because I won't even discuss surrender
until my family is out of the country.

02:04.834 --> 02:08.004
Until then, we have nothing to talk about.

03:52.942 --> 03:55.737
<i>Congressional leaders
are calling for immediate action</i>

03:55.820 --> 04:00.241
<i>and President Gaviria has called an
emergency meeting of the national police.</i>

04:00.325 --> 04:02.094
<i>Yesterday's bombing
has resulted in a total of...</i>

04:02.118 --> 04:03.953
Now he's really fucked up.

04:06.164 --> 04:09.667
Pacho... I want you on a plane to Miami.

04:10.919 --> 04:12.253
It's time.

04:13.254 --> 04:16.466
And Escobar's family? Should we get them?

04:17.342 --> 04:20.803
No, not now. They're surrounded by police.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.932
They're not going anywhere.

04:28.019 --> 04:29.812
Son of a bitch.

04:47.956 --> 04:50.458
Stay there. You can go.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.210
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

04:59.217 --> 05:03.221
Agent Jimenez, put out that cigarette
and go downstairs, please.

05:05.348 --> 05:08.059
- And don't smoke in the room again.
- Yes, sir.

05:10.561 --> 05:11.561
Thank you.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.564
Excuse me.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.903
- Who wants dinner?
- Me!

05:21.197 --> 05:24.492
Stop looking out the window.
There's no one out there.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.160
Come eat something.

05:26.244 --> 05:28.413
- Mama?
- Yes, my love?

05:28.538 --> 05:30.540
Who are Los Pepes?

05:33.543 --> 05:37.922
No one. No one you have to worry about.
All right, my love?

05:38.047 --> 05:40.008
And how much longer do we have to be here?

05:40.091 --> 05:41.676
Not much longer, love. Keep eating.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.178
Can I speak with you a moment?

05:48.016 --> 05:51.436
- We have to do something, Hermilda.
- Pablo will fix this, like always.

05:51.561 --> 05:53.688
We can't even call him.

05:55.732 --> 05:58.609
Even if we could,
all the telephones are tapped anyway.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.699
We're alone, Hermilda.

06:05.742 --> 06:08.703
And you're telling me
everything will be okay?

07:40.294 --> 07:41.379
Excuse me, Colonel...

09:05.630 --> 09:08.716
CARLOS HOLGUIN POLICE BASE

09:16.974 --> 09:19.310
Blackie. What's going on?

09:19.393 --> 09:22.647
<i>- Do you think you can get inside?</i>
- No, boss. I don't think so.

09:22.772 --> 09:25.399
With all the police swarming around,
it's impossible.

09:25.483 --> 09:28.611
Can you see the top floor?
Through the windows?

09:29.320 --> 09:32.156
No, I can't. It's too difficult.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.451
Keep your eyes on it, Blackie.
You might see something.

09:36.327 --> 09:37.578
Sure, boss.

09:37.662 --> 09:40.331
All right, as soon as you see anything,
call me.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.834
<i>Blackie...</i>

09:44.335 --> 09:46.754
<i>it's important that I know they're okay.</i>

09:48.256 --> 09:49.674
Hey, boss.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.176
Can you believe it?

09:52.969 --> 09:55.596
Just this second,
Tata came into view, boss.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.598
What do you see? Is she alone?

09:57.682 --> 10:00.184
<i>She looks beautiful. She's at the window.</i>

10:00.309 --> 10:04.355
She's got that dress on that you had me
bring from Miami, remember, boss?

10:04.480 --> 10:05.815
The one you like so much.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.111
The children, Blackie. Can you see them?

10:11.112 --> 10:13.698
There, I can see Manuela, boss.

10:15.533 --> 10:18.995
- Can she see you?
- She looks so pretty, boss.

10:20.496 --> 10:21.706
Go.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.208
Blackie...

10:25.793 --> 10:27.378
thanks for this.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.711
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR; IN DEFENSE
OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, LOS PEPES

11:18.346 --> 11:20.348
- Héctor.
- Sir.

11:20.431 --> 11:23.351
Do me a favor and bring Miss Judy a beer.

11:23.434 --> 11:25.102
- Of course, boss.
- Thanks.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.772
This isn't about Pablo.
Pablo is a dead man.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.442
It's just a matter of time.
We're here to talk about the future.

11:31.567 --> 11:35.363
And if you're interested in the future,
then you'll have to join us.

11:37.698 --> 11:41.202
Listen, Judy,
you know we never had problems with Pablo.

11:41.285 --> 11:45.122
Plus, we had a very good relationship
with Kiko. Right, Berna?

11:45.247 --> 11:48.209
- Yes.
- And that's why we made the decision

11:48.292 --> 11:50.086
to stay out of this shit.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.798
And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

11:54.757 --> 11:56.967
Because things are very difficult.

11:57.093 --> 12:01.222
And when all this shit is over,
the organization will change,

12:01.305 --> 12:04.058
the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

12:08.729 --> 12:12.066
And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

12:12.149 --> 12:14.402
That's why I'm talking to you.

12:14.485 --> 12:16.821
If all of us from Medellín are united,

12:16.904 --> 12:19.949
we'll be able to say
what happens to each one of us.

12:24.412 --> 12:28.416
Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

12:28.499 --> 12:30.835
and you tell them you're on our side.

12:36.132 --> 12:38.134
She wants them to join Los Pepes.

12:43.514 --> 12:46.100
They say Pablo Escobar is fucked,
that his time has come.

12:47.435 --> 12:49.520
And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

12:50.855 --> 12:53.858
- What did they say?
- They're joining.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.363
Here's the information.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.616
They have a meeting
with the Castaños on Friday.

13:03.993 --> 13:05.536
This is big, boss.

13:05.619 --> 13:10.791
If the Gallóns are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too.

13:13.711 --> 13:15.045
When is it?

13:15.171 --> 13:17.965
Friday at 9:00 p.m., boss.

13:19.175 --> 13:20.676
Take that address...

13:22.219 --> 13:24.513
and go to Montecasino.

13:25.556 --> 13:26.724
Take Limón with you.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.019
And find out what's going on over there.

13:31.312 --> 13:32.312
Quica.

13:34.023 --> 13:35.149
Are you all right?

13:35.232 --> 13:36.901
Yes, boss.

13:43.199 --> 13:45.242
How many men can we rely on?

13:46.410 --> 13:51.415
I think I can round up a hundred.
But we need cash.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.920
How much money do we have on hand?

13:56.045 --> 14:02.760
If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

14:02.843 --> 14:06.597
It's... around this much.

14:08.098 --> 14:11.435
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.438
But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

14:15.439 --> 14:21.946
Make sure we have the weapons and the men
we need when the time comes. Got it?

14:22.613 --> 14:26.700
The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.581
Then we can take care of business.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.625
Go on.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.126
Yes, sir.

16:07.635 --> 16:08.886
Pass that to me.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.649
Nothing relevant has happened today.

16:21.732 --> 16:25.819
Corrupt politicians, celebrity divorces.
Bullshit.

16:25.903 --> 16:29.156
You don't like it, go work at CNN.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.158
- Miss Velez.
- Yes, honey?

16:31.241 --> 16:33.161
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but you have a call--

16:33.202 --> 16:35.496
Take a message, I'm about to go on air.

16:35.579 --> 16:39.041
Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.
She says it's urgent.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.760
What are you doing? Answer the call.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.893
You have to get her
to give you an interview.

17:05.734 --> 17:06.734
Hello?

17:09.697 --> 17:10.948
<i>Hello?</i>

17:13.450 --> 17:16.620
I know that you and I have had
a lot of problems in the past.

17:19.415 --> 17:21.208
But I need you to help me.

17:49.111 --> 17:53.657
<i>I brought all the influence
the party can bear on Gaviria.</i>

17:54.491 --> 18:01.498
And it seems he has agreed
to find asylum for your family.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.168
<i>Where?</i>

18:04.251 --> 18:06.503
No, that remains to be seen.

18:07.337 --> 18:10.674
But we will meet in his office,

18:10.799 --> 18:16.096
I suppose to discuss the terms
of their relocation.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.515
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

18:18.640 --> 18:21.435
- You're a man of your word.
<i>- I am.</i>

18:21.518 --> 18:24.021
Now you must be of your word.

18:24.521 --> 18:27.775
<i>I will. Be sure of that.</i>

18:27.858 --> 18:32.529
The moment my family is safe,
we will speak again.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.948
<i>- Until then.</i>
- Thank you.

18:37.659 --> 18:38.869
She's here.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.370
Bring her here.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.563
Hello, Valeria.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.736
I liked it more with the hood on.

19:12.861 --> 19:18.909
I told them, don't take me anywhere
that doesn't have a beautiful pool.

19:22.162 --> 19:25.249
It's very dangerous
to be my friend these days.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.212
Come on.

19:43.600 --> 19:49.773
Look. These are the codes for the radio.
I'll put them here.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.401
And here is some cash.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.448
This is for you.

19:58.574 --> 20:02.119
- No, Pablo. I don't want your money.
- It's for your help.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.208
I'm doing this for you.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.725
Thank you.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.608
I'm worried about you, Pablo.

20:52.169 --> 20:55.756
You guys can't do shit to me.

20:56.340 --> 20:59.927
De Greiff offered us amnesty.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.471
That's right.

21:04.348 --> 21:05.849
But you have to talk to get it.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.686
You want to negotiate, gringo?

21:09.811 --> 21:12.189
You want to negotiate? Let's negotiate.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.359
I'll give you something. Something small.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.819
Blackie...

21:20.948 --> 21:23.533
Blackie, Blackie, Blackie.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.831
What name did your mother give you?

21:32.793 --> 21:35.545
Nelson Hernández... Lucumí.

21:35.671 --> 21:36.880
Lucumí?

21:40.050 --> 21:41.677
From the Pacific.

21:43.553 --> 21:48.350
Lucumí, they found explosive residue
on your hands.

21:50.227 --> 21:52.479
On your jacket, everywhere.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.707
They're going to blame you
for that bomb, Lucumí.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.586
Hey...

22:19.381 --> 22:22.843
- I had nothing to do with it.
- We know that.

22:23.552 --> 22:27.723
We know it wasn't your idea.
We know you're not the boss.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.522
Don't let them blame you for this.

22:35.605 --> 22:40.610
Don't let them see you as the one
who killed all those innocent children.

22:45.115 --> 22:48.285
Help us and we'll help you.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.457
Give us Pablo.

22:54.458 --> 22:58.587
No fucking way. I can't give you Pablo.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.590
No fucking way I give you the boss.

23:02.591 --> 23:04.259
Then give us something.

23:06.053 --> 23:08.722
You have to give us something
or they'll hang you.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.815
I'll give you...

23:21.151 --> 23:22.486
La Quica.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.576
Faggots.

23:51.014 --> 23:52.682
There's a lot of them.

23:55.352 --> 23:57.604
Do you think we can take all of them?

23:58.605 --> 24:00.357
What's wrong, brother?

24:01.024 --> 24:03.944
You're turning into a pussy.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.782
If you're scared, why don't you run away?

24:08.865 --> 24:11.535
Abandon the boss.
It's that easy, brother.

24:12.702 --> 24:14.037
No, brother.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.333
I'm loyal to the boss.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.546
And if I have to die, I'll die, brother.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.965
You better, motherfucker.

25:13.221 --> 25:14.764
- Trujillo.
- Yes, Colonel.

25:14.890 --> 25:16.766
Prepare the emergency team.

25:16.892 --> 25:19.269
They need to be ready
when we get the signal.

25:19.394 --> 25:22.564
- Yes, Colonel.
- Martinez, get your people ready.

25:23.190 --> 25:25.775
We'll start tracking them
first thing tomorrow.

25:25.859 --> 25:27.444
At your service, Colonel.

25:43.293 --> 25:44.961
Good work on Blackie.

25:47.631 --> 25:50.133
I need to know you didn't make the call.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.806
The only thing I want
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.

25:56.890 --> 25:58.642
It's the only thing I want, Peña.

25:59.768 --> 26:02.145
- For all the lives he has taken.
- I know.

26:04.314 --> 26:05.941
But not with them.

26:07.943 --> 26:10.654
I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

26:10.779 --> 26:15.408
When Escobar dies, a Colombian cop
should be standing over him.

26:23.959 --> 26:26.253
- Good evening, Ms. Velez.
- Good evening.

26:26.336 --> 26:28.922
Welcome, they're expecting you.

26:33.134 --> 26:35.512
What is she doing here?

26:39.975 --> 26:41.351
I sent for her.

26:42.185 --> 26:44.354
Please, take the children to their room.

26:45.981 --> 26:47.524
Please.

26:48.149 --> 26:50.485
Let's go.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.375
This is from Pablo.

27:09.212 --> 27:11.631
It's a radio telephone,
so you can speak with him.

27:12.841 --> 27:16.219
This is a cipher sheet
for the frequencies he'll be on all day.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.057
You must keep it hidden.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.022
He also sent you money.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.071
Thank you.

27:44.247 --> 27:48.752
Well, let's do the interview already.

27:51.588 --> 27:54.924
You know what? Another time.

27:56.009 --> 27:57.761
When all of this is over.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.943
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.
I can't leave so quickly.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.033
Then stay.

28:21.701 --> 28:24.079
You can show yourself out
when you're ready.

28:33.296 --> 28:34.923
<i>Pablo?</i>

28:40.470 --> 28:41.470
Tata.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.724
Pablo, is it you?

28:46.226 --> 28:48.812
So good to hear your voice, my love.

28:50.980 --> 28:53.149
<i>How are you, Tata?</i>

28:54.401 --> 28:56.152
How are our children?

28:56.820 --> 28:58.571
My love, we're all okay.

28:58.655 --> 29:00.573
<i>We need you.</i>

29:00.657 --> 29:02.158
And I need you.

29:02.283 --> 29:05.578
Listen, I'm going to get
you out of there soon.

29:05.662 --> 29:08.998
<i>I talked to the attorney general.
Everything is ready.</i>

29:10.417 --> 29:12.836
Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.

29:14.337 --> 29:16.172
I love you very much.

29:16.297 --> 29:19.592
I love you, my darling. I love you...

29:38.153 --> 29:43.032
Mr. President, I ask you
not to take this as a failure.

29:45.201 --> 29:48.371
Escobar will be brought to justice.

29:48.455 --> 29:51.624
And once his family is out of Colombia,

29:51.708 --> 29:56.045
he will reinitiate negotiations
for his surrender.

29:56.129 --> 29:59.174
- I already did that.
- Yes.

29:59.716 --> 30:03.136
Well, I've got a list here

30:03.219 --> 30:08.391
of possible locations that would be safe
for the Escobar family.

30:08.516 --> 30:14.355
If you ask officially,
those countries will allow them to enter.

30:18.401 --> 30:20.403
Attorney General De Greiff...

30:21.696 --> 30:23.364
it seems you've been misinformed.

30:26.493 --> 30:29.662
Escobar's family isn't going anywhere.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.166
Pardon me?

30:33.249 --> 30:35.835
I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.

30:36.544 --> 30:41.090
I am categorically opposed
to you or anyone else doing so.

30:41.174 --> 30:43.426
Do you know what that means?

30:44.344 --> 30:46.346
There will be no surrender.

30:46.429 --> 30:50.183
The violence will not end.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.603
And you will be the one responsible.

30:53.686 --> 30:57.190
You... will be the one responsible.

30:58.441 --> 31:02.779
Your promises and negotiations
have only brought us more violence,

31:02.862 --> 31:04.447
while making him stronger.

31:05.240 --> 31:10.203
This, Mr. De Greiff, doesn't end
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.

31:11.412 --> 31:12.455
This...

31:15.083 --> 31:17.085
This ends with his death.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.216
<i>No, you don't need to worry
about anything.</i>

31:23.299 --> 31:27.220
Put yourself at ease. We got it.

31:28.429 --> 31:32.225
<i>Miami is ours.
I'll be back in Colombia tonight.</i>

31:43.152 --> 31:44.487
How's it going?

31:45.947 --> 31:47.657
What's up, little Lion?

31:47.782 --> 31:49.993
Doing good. Just hanging out.

31:50.118 --> 31:51.911
Is everything packed or what?

31:53.955 --> 31:57.333
I don't get why you're staying
in this dump, brother.

31:57.417 --> 31:59.502
I would have thought that Pacho Herrera

31:59.586 --> 32:03.506
would be staying in a five star hotel
with all the bells and whistles--

32:29.157 --> 32:31.284
- Do you want juice, my love?
- Yes.

32:31.367 --> 32:32.869
I'll take more.

33:02.231 --> 33:05.151
PABLO'S WHORE

33:12.492 --> 33:15.828
So my business is done? Is that right?

33:15.912 --> 33:18.081
I can't get anyone on the phone, sir.

33:18.748 --> 33:23.503
I called many times. Many times.

33:24.587 --> 33:28.341
I called everyone in Miami.
There's no trace of the Lion.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.267
<i>Pablo!</i>

33:48.111 --> 33:48.945
Tata?

33:49.028 --> 33:52.782
<i>Pablo, they killed her.
They dumped her in front of the hotel.</i>

33:52.865 --> 33:54.283
<i>Who?</i>

33:57.245 --> 33:58.454
Valeria.

34:07.588 --> 34:09.090
Are you all okay?

34:11.300 --> 34:12.969
<i>Yes, we're okay.</i>

34:13.761 --> 34:14.761
Listen.

34:15.471 --> 34:18.558
<i>I need you to be strong.</i>

34:18.641 --> 34:23.479
Everything will end soon. But you need
to be stronger than ever, Tata.

34:24.272 --> 34:26.816
<i>I'll call you back soon.</i>

34:26.899 --> 34:28.568
<i>I love you very much.</i>

34:38.119 --> 34:39.495
<i>Tonight...</i>

34:40.288 --> 34:43.750
we're going to fight
like we've never fought before.

34:45.293 --> 34:48.004
We'll fight with everything we have.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.592
Fuck the Cali cartel!

34:52.675 --> 34:54.343
Fuck Judy Moncada!

34:54.427 --> 34:56.846
Fuck Los Castaños!

34:56.971 --> 35:00.516
We're going to show these motherfuckers
who they are messing with,

35:00.600 --> 35:03.603
because we're still the Medellín cartel

35:03.686 --> 35:08.191
and tonight we're going to Montecasino!

35:11.694 --> 35:14.947
Bring all the men we can buy.

35:15.031 --> 35:19.786
Go to Medellín,
to every money stash we have

35:19.869 --> 35:22.288
and bring me every penny you can find.

35:23.039 --> 35:25.625
Limón and Quica
will take me to Montecasino,

35:25.708 --> 35:31.547
because tonight we'll be fighting
side by side to the death.

35:31.672 --> 35:34.884
And when those motherfuckers
open their doors to the Gallóns,

35:34.967 --> 35:38.137
we'll go in and hit them
with everything we have!

35:38.721 --> 35:40.556
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.

35:41.349 --> 35:42.350
Boss...

35:44.852 --> 35:46.354
I think I should go with Rojas.

35:47.730 --> 35:49.065
It's too dangerous.

35:55.238 --> 35:56.322
Okay.

35:57.865 --> 35:59.867
Take Ricardo with you.

36:00.910 --> 36:02.495
As you wish, boss.

36:03.412 --> 36:04.413
Let's go, brother.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.544
- Let's go!
- Quickly!

36:22.431 --> 36:23.850
Let's go!

36:39.198 --> 36:43.202
There. After that corner. Right there.

36:47.748 --> 36:51.127
What are the odds that we survive tonight?

36:52.461 --> 36:56.632
Fifty-fifty.
But that's pretty good for us.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.260
Let's do this quickly.

37:12.315 --> 37:13.649
I think we're ready.

37:13.774 --> 37:16.110
We've cast as wide a net as possible.

37:19.488 --> 37:20.781
Go ahead.

37:46.849 --> 37:49.477
Hello?

37:50.519 --> 37:53.773
<i>I can't hear you. Hello?</i>

37:56.484 --> 37:57.484
Damn it.

38:01.989 --> 38:03.449
Let's go.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.203
Let's go to 10th and 32nd street.

38:23.678 --> 38:24.845
Answer it.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.892
Fucking answer it. Could be the boss.

38:30.977 --> 38:32.144
<i>Hello?</i>

38:34.146 --> 38:35.189
Quica.

38:35.815 --> 38:36.815
<i>Hello.</i>

38:36.857 --> 38:39.485
Shit. Who the fuck is this?

38:39.568 --> 38:43.322
- Hello, Quica. How's it going, my friend?
<i>- Motherfucker. Who is this?</i>

38:43.406 --> 38:48.411
<i>Calm down, Quica. Don't be nervous.
What's up, Quica?</i>

38:48.494 --> 38:50.538
Who the fuck do you think you are, bitch?

38:54.750 --> 38:57.420
- Velén, let's go!
- Let's go, they're in Laureles!

39:12.351 --> 39:16.105
Hey, Rojas, wait for me.
You're leaving me behind.

39:35.958 --> 39:36.959
Hello?

39:37.877 --> 39:40.629
<i>Quica. What's up, Quica?</i>

39:40.755 --> 39:44.216
Quica, Quica, Quica.
What time is it, Quica?

39:44.300 --> 39:46.635
<i>- What are you up to, Quica?</i>
- Bastard.

39:52.641 --> 39:55.144
You're the accountant.
How much is there?

39:55.269 --> 39:57.229
I don't know. Maybe $500,000.

39:59.273 --> 40:03.986
Looks like you're almost out of money.
Leave some for the market, fat ass.

40:05.404 --> 40:06.238
So funny.

40:06.322 --> 40:07.990
Why aren't you watching the car--

40:18.793 --> 40:23.089
Sorry, but this toss of the coin
doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

40:23.172 --> 40:24.507
Let's make a deal.

40:56.664 --> 40:57.706
Go right.

41:19.895 --> 41:21.564
Copy that! We're on it!

41:27.903 --> 41:30.406
Perez, close all of 4th street.
Go straight.

41:30.489 --> 41:31.824
We'll go this way to cut him off.

41:39.248 --> 41:40.916
Come on, pussy.

41:48.591 --> 41:50.342
There! Follow him!

41:52.219 --> 41:53.762
Follow him!

41:53.888 --> 41:55.264
To the right!

41:58.851 --> 42:00.519
All units, be ready for the play.

42:41.810 --> 42:42.895
Fucker.

43:27.982 --> 43:29.024
Limón.

43:30.526 --> 43:31.610
Relax.

43:33.988 --> 43:35.531
Okay, boss.

43:37.616 --> 43:40.327
- Are we ready?
- They're all waiting for us, boss.

43:40.953 --> 43:42.538
I think we have enough.

43:47.167 --> 43:49.336
La Quica isn't answering, boss.

43:55.968 --> 43:57.219
Okay.

43:59.680 --> 44:02.057
Go start the car.
I'll be there in a second.

44:02.182 --> 44:03.684
Yes, sir.

45:34.108 --> 45:36.068
Where's the staging area?

45:36.151 --> 45:39.655
You want me to hand you information,
just like that?

45:39.780 --> 45:41.115
Free?

45:41.824 --> 45:43.659
No, brother.

45:43.784 --> 45:44.993
I want a deal.

45:45.077 --> 45:49.498
Then give us Pablo... asshole.

45:50.290 --> 45:52.334
I want something different.

45:52.459 --> 45:56.296
I want to start a new life,
in the United States of America.

46:10.519 --> 46:15.983
We don't have time for bullshit.
Blackie already rolled on all of you.

46:19.695 --> 46:23.949
If you don't give us something fast,
of substance,

46:24.032 --> 46:29.872
we'll buy you that ticket
to the United States... but extradited.

46:29.955 --> 46:33.292
- Extradition doesn't exist.
- Fine, then a jail cell here.

46:33.876 --> 46:37.546
With a sign that says "snitch"
around your neck.

47:18.212 --> 47:19.212
Quica.

47:19.254 --> 47:21.673
<i>Hello. Where are you, boss?</i>

47:21.757 --> 47:24.092
I'm en route, and you?

47:24.176 --> 47:26.053
<i>Me too. I'm not too far off.</i>

47:30.891 --> 47:35.938
I'm almost there, boss.
Are you still far off?

47:41.443 --> 47:43.278
Pass the phone to Ricardo.

47:45.197 --> 47:49.117
Boss, Ricardo went to get one last stash.

47:49.201 --> 47:50.786
He's on his way.

47:51.620 --> 47:55.541
You want me to meet you?
Are you with Limón?

48:03.423 --> 48:05.217
Yes, we're almost there.

48:15.936 --> 48:21.149
You have what you wanted.
He'll be there soon. Limón is driving.

48:23.485 --> 48:25.571
Now give us the staging point.

48:28.448 --> 48:29.825
Pull over.

48:36.832 --> 48:38.458
Give me a moment.

48:40.252 --> 48:41.252
Sure, boss.

48:47.426 --> 48:48.635
<i>Tata.</i>

48:52.848 --> 48:53.932
Yes, my love?

48:54.016 --> 48:58.770
<i>I just want you to know...
that I love you very much.</i>

48:58.854 --> 49:01.690
<i>You and our children.</i>

49:04.943 --> 49:08.030
You may not hear from me for a while.

49:08.655 --> 49:10.532
What's happening, Pablo?

49:11.617 --> 49:13.035
What are you going to do?

49:15.370 --> 49:17.205
Something I have to do.

49:20.167 --> 49:26.340
<i>But you know that I will never,
never leave you, right?</i>

49:28.508 --> 49:29.676
I know.

49:36.016 --> 49:37.726
I love you, Tata.

49:42.147 --> 49:44.691
I will always love you, Pablo.

50:05.879 --> 50:09.508
Keep going down that road.
I'll show you the way.

50:09.591 --> 50:10.592
Yes, boss.

51:03.812 --> 51:05.063
Fuck.

51:08.567 --> 51:09.901
I've got something.

51:09.985 --> 51:12.654
Attention all units.
A vehicle is approaching. Be alert.

51:34.509 --> 51:35.927
Hey, girls.

51:41.016 --> 51:43.018
Negative. They're whores.

51:49.483 --> 51:51.359
All right. Let the women through.

51:51.443 --> 51:54.029
Stand by, everyone.
This isn't happening tonight.

52:00.202 --> 52:02.037
Fire! Let's go! Fire!

52:29.648 --> 52:31.566
What will happen with Quica, boss?

52:36.238 --> 52:37.864
Quica is gone, Limón.

52:41.576 --> 52:43.036
They're all gone.
