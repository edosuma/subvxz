00:36.270 --> 00:38.642
- You see what happened over here?
- I was watchin' the game.

00:38.707 --> 00:41.044
- You didn't see anybody with a gun?
- Nope.

00:41.111 --> 00:43.571
Look over there.
There was a lot of people got shot.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.945
- Sure you didn't see anything?
- When they started shootin', everybody started runnin'.

00:47.010 --> 00:49.567
Sergeant. Get these people
out of my crime scene.

00:49.637 --> 00:51.715
I don't wanna see
any cameras around here.

00:51.787 --> 00:54.125
- This thing was a disaster waitin' to happen.
- Oh, yeah.

00:54.191 --> 00:57.809
There should have been a police presence here.
Thejob should've known that.

00:57.878 --> 01:00.085
Stand over there
and wait until I come back.

01:00.152 --> 01:02.329
Come on. Clear this area.

01:02.397 --> 01:07.622
This big rush of people came running
into the street, and so I hit the brakes.

01:07.687 --> 01:11.075
And we heard gunshots,
and then Eileen started screaming.

01:11.150 --> 01:14.057
And I looked over,
and she was bleeding.

01:14.130 --> 01:16.501
- Did you see anybody holding a gun?
- No.

01:16.566 --> 01:18.327
Just people running at us
like maniacs.

01:20.477 --> 01:23.385
- Did you see who shot you?
- Shots were goin' off all over the place.

01:23.459 --> 01:26.017
- What set this off?
- I don't know, man.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.893
What set this off?

01:30.961 --> 01:33.454
We were into the game.
We don't know what the hell went on.

01:33.525 --> 01:35.252
Do I know you?
What's your name?

01:35.321 --> 01:39.551
Zack Swanson. Played for North Carolina State
between '79 and '83.

01:39.617 --> 01:41.563
I tried out two seasons straight
for the Bullets.

01:41.637 --> 01:45.156
Man, that's impressive. You got
some real great talent out here.

01:45.228 --> 01:47.564
Guys, how much you get paid
for a game like this?

01:47.631 --> 01:49.610
- 200 apiece?
- Get paid?

01:49.683 --> 01:51.957
Yeah, get paid.
You know, like, uh...

01:52.024 --> 01:54.001
this drug dealer
versus that drug dealer.

01:54.074 --> 01:57.463
Put together a good, strong game,
a nice neighborhood event.

01:57.537 --> 01:59.450
Maybe even an opportunity
for wagering.

01:59.525 --> 02:01.919
I mean, who's to figure violence
would break out, right?

02:01.993 --> 02:05.228
Look, we were just ballin'.
I don't know what you talkin' about.

02:05.296 --> 02:08.979
You know what? Why don't we take 'em
down to the station house?

02:09.044 --> 02:11.056
We'll hear more about
their college playin'careers.

02:11.130 --> 02:12.988
- Yeah, let's do that.
- That all right with you guys?

02:13.053 --> 02:14.846
N.C. State, right?

02:21.773 --> 02:23.751
Back behind the line.

02:26.966 --> 02:29.753
- Run it for me.
- We got two dead- shot at close range...

02:29.818 --> 02:31.995
seven wounded by gunfire.

02:32.064 --> 02:35.201
Three more seriously injured by trampling
after the shooting began.

02:35.269 --> 02:37.925
We got shell casings all over the court
from at least five different shooters.

02:37.996 --> 02:40.782
- Any idea how it started?
- Somebody missed a layup?

02:40.847 --> 02:44.531
Somebody told us there were, like,
200 people here watchin'the game.

02:44.598 --> 02:48.217
Most of them gone by the time we got here.
The ones we talked to said they didn't see no guns.

02:48.285 --> 02:50.230
It's drug related in some kinda way.

02:50.305 --> 02:52.282
This scumbag here,
I arrested myself last year.

02:52.356 --> 02:54.084
He had a shopping bag full of crack.

02:54.152 --> 02:57.868
- You find Kwasi Olushola?
- Nah. Booked.

02:57.935 --> 03:01.324
Why should he hang around? All he did
was bring the brothers together, right?

03:01.397 --> 03:03.986
- You got something useful to add, Andy?
- It's just I'm wonderin'.

03:04.058 --> 03:07.062
- I wasn't privy to any negotiations-
- That's right. You weren't.

03:07.134 --> 03:09.660
I'm havin' a hard time seein' how
the precinct gets talked out of policin' this.

03:09.732 --> 03:12.967
That decision was made.
We need to focus now on the job at hand.

03:14.796 --> 03:17.452
So, uh, we'll find Kwasi.

03:17.523 --> 03:20.527
Yeah. Find Kwasi.

03:20.599 --> 03:22.970
Yeah, let's talk to Kwasi.

04:34.587 --> 04:36.443
You got your hand on the pulse
of the streets, Lieutenant.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.848
I wanna hear again why we should
have stayed away from this game...

04:38.915 --> 04:41.307
how a police presence
might inflame a bad situation.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.295
I turned out wrong.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.796
I know the same recommendation
came from a lot of other places...

04:45.870 --> 04:48.395
like Community Relations
and so forth.

04:48.467 --> 04:50.544
But, Arthur,
you're the one I trusted.

04:50.615 --> 04:53.587
You said this Brother Kwasi had
everyone's respect in those projects.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.382
I also named three other public gatherings
where he was a go-between.

04:56.449 --> 04:58.842
The department kept its distance,
and everything went right.

04:58.917 --> 05:00.644
But this one didn't, did it, Arthur?

05:00.713 --> 05:05.194
- You know what's waitin'for us down at One Police Plaza?
- I got a pretty good idea.

05:05.266 --> 05:07.179
They're lookin' to hang
a bull's-eye on somebody.

05:07.254 --> 05:09.199
It was my recommendation.

05:09.273 --> 05:12.629
Arthur, the information at hand...

05:12.703 --> 05:14.681
I absolutely understand
your thinking.

05:14.755 --> 05:17.761
The game's a memorial to a kid
who dies in police custody.

05:17.833 --> 05:19.974
Anticop sentiment running high
in the neighborhood...

05:20.043 --> 05:23.498
I'll let 'em know it was me.

05:23.570 --> 05:26.292
Arthur, you take this hit, and I'll
make it right with you down the line.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.857
You know my word's good on that.

05:29.405 --> 05:32.444
- We do it now?
- Yeah. I think we oughta go.

05:36.843 --> 05:38.700
We got somethin', Lieu. Inspector.

05:38.766 --> 05:40.625
- Good news, Detective?
- Possibly.

05:40.690 --> 05:43.565
- I'll meet you down there.
- Yeah, all right.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.545
- What's up?
- Liquor store owner two blocks from the basketball court...

05:46.620 --> 05:50.140
recognized the guy running past his place
at the time of the shootout.

05:50.211 --> 05:52.801
Looked like he was holding a gun.
Street name's Bo-Bo.

05:52.871 --> 05:55.047
That's the first witness
puttin' a gun in somebody's hand?

05:55.116 --> 05:57.356
Yeah. I came back,
and I checked with Narcotics.

05:57.425 --> 06:00.976
The guy works for a Petey Green
dealing out of the projects on Avenue D."

06:01.046 --> 06:03.286
- Green was one of the game's backers.
- Yeah.

06:03.355 --> 06:06.557
He sponsored one of the teams. The other
dealer, Charlton Moody, backed the other one.

06:06.624 --> 06:08.733
Narcotics gave me
Bo-Bo Thomas's address.

06:08.805 --> 06:10.116
Get Bobby and Andy.
Pick him up.

06:10.183 --> 06:12.390
They're lookin' for that activist Kwasi
at the hospital.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.596
- We got a tip that he was seein'someone there.
- Get backup from Anticrime.

06:15.665 --> 06:18.223
- I'll be at One Police Plaza.
- All right, Lieutenant.

06:18.293 --> 06:20.312
Boss is lookin'
to pin this mess on you?

06:20.379 --> 06:22.937
Go get your guy.

06:34.164 --> 06:37.946
This Kwasi's got some set ofballs.
Visits people he put in the hospital.

06:38.012 --> 06:40.252
The guy funds some good
community programs, Andy.

06:40.319 --> 06:42.941
- Off drug money.
- You know that for a fact?

06:43.011 --> 06:45.406
- I heard it was city grants.
- This was a drug dealers' basketball game.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.338
These guys are whackin'
each other two a day.

06:47.404 --> 06:50.344
They start throwin' bullets at the game,
and we're in Hoboken...

06:50.418 --> 06:52.526
'cause this hump tells Fancy
everything will be mellow.

06:52.597 --> 06:55.187
There's Kwasi.

06:55.258 --> 06:57.499
You better deal with this jerk.

06:57.566 --> 07:01.348
Do not rule out the possibility the first shot
came from an agent provocateur.

07:01.414 --> 07:03.970
- Workin' for who?
- Who stands to benefit from this?

07:04.041 --> 07:05.954
Kwasi Olushola? Detective Simone.
We gotta talk to you.

07:06.030 --> 07:08.204
May I please finish
my conversation first?

07:08.275 --> 07:10.547
You organized an event
where several homicides took place.

07:10.614 --> 07:12.723
Whatever you got to say,
you need to be tellin' us.

07:12.794 --> 07:15.351
- I don't need to be tellin' you anything.
- We're hearin' that a lot, Kwasi.

07:15.423 --> 07:17.282
You tellin' witnesses not to cooperate?

07:17.347 --> 07:21.446
Black folk do not need me to tell them
not to talk to the police. Believe that.

07:21.513 --> 07:24.650
- You a reporter?
- Yeah. Dave Bloom. Village View.

07:24.720 --> 07:28.108
Oh, the Village View, huh?
You were at this basketball game?

07:28.182 --> 07:30.041
- Yeah. I'm doin' a story on it.
- What'd you see?

07:30.106 --> 07:35.779
- Uh, I'm a reporter, you know?
- Yeah, and I'm a detective.

07:35.843 --> 07:38.466
And you got somebody else's
blood and brain matter on your clothes.

07:38.536 --> 07:42.372
So I'm guessin' you were pretty close
to the action, and I wanna know what you saw.

07:42.447 --> 07:45.006
Do you abolish
the First Amendment, Detective?

07:45.076 --> 07:47.219
Our only purpose here
is to find out who shot who.

07:47.289 --> 07:49.528
- So you can pin a medal on 'em.
- You shut up.

07:49.596 --> 07:51.739
Instead of First Amendment,
you oughta start worryin'...

07:51.809 --> 07:54.749
how whoever's responsible for that
might come lookin'to hit witnesses.

07:54.822 --> 07:58.242
You people wanted this to happen.
The cops resented this game from the outset...

07:58.315 --> 08:00.524
because it was in memory
of a young black man murdered by police.

08:00.593 --> 08:03.052
- All right, Kwasi, calm down.
- That kid died from some kind of seizure.

08:03.126 --> 08:05.517
He was murdered,
and the racist NYPD covered it up!

08:05.592 --> 08:07.669
- Let's tell it at the station house.
- Am I charged with a crime?

08:07.741 --> 08:10.562
- Don't be flailin' your arms.
- I don't have to go anywhere with you.

08:10.627 --> 08:13.151
You dealin' with that one nigger in a thousand
who knows what you can and cannot do.

08:13.224 --> 08:16.393
I'm dealin' with the nigger whose big mouth
is responsible for this massacre.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.986
- Shut up, Andy. - Back off!
- Now I know you're nuts!

08:19.057 --> 08:20.849
Come here!

08:20.917 --> 08:24.819
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. Go ahead and cuff me.
- That's right.

08:24.892 --> 08:29.209
See, you made a bad choice there, Kwasi,
'cause now you are a collar.

08:29.283 --> 08:31.743
Weak! Typical-
Typical police move!

08:31.816 --> 08:34.855
Wait up a minute.
You use that word often, Detective?

08:34.926 --> 08:38.160
- Hold that elevator, please.
- Well, do you, Detective?

08:38.229 --> 08:41.104
We have got a prisoner on this elevator.
You are not gettin' on.

08:41.178 --> 08:44.598
I'm just curious. Are you a racist?
Do you use the word nigger" often?

08:44.671 --> 08:46.847
- Back off!
- Kiss my ass, you smart-mouth little punk.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.262
Fool wants to know
if your partner's a racist.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.574
When he figures that out,
he's gonna work on how babies get here.

08:54.642 --> 08:58.543
- Shut up, Kwasi.
- Black people shootin'each other, me in handcuffs.

08:58.617 --> 09:00.563
This day just keeps gettin'
better and better for you.

09:00.638 --> 09:03.009
I'm doin' my job, Kwasi.

09:03.073 --> 09:05.761
Plus, you know,
a white girl was shot too.

09:05.830 --> 09:08.704
Her only mistake was bein' in a car
on Houston Street...

09:08.780 --> 09:11.151
when your lowlife homeys
decide to act their color.

09:11.215 --> 09:13.392
You racist son of a bitch.

09:13.461 --> 09:15.853
I knew you were stone-cold racist
the minute I laid eyes on you.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.971
You're gonna make me bust out crying,
you keep calling me that.

09:18.044 --> 09:21.367
Come on, come on. Let's go, Kwasi.

09:49.237 --> 09:51.095
I wanna see Arthur Fancy.

09:51.161 --> 09:53.498
Remember we called ahead, Kwasi?
He's not available just now.

09:53.564 --> 09:57.083
Just now, he's at One Police Plaza
gettin' reamed by his bosses...

09:57.154 --> 09:59.134
for takin' your word
that ball game was gonna come off...

09:59.207 --> 10:01.928
like one of them
happy sneaker commercials.

10:01.995 --> 10:03.854
You guys can get
as busy as you want...

10:03.920 --> 10:05.777
but I'm not talkin'
till Arthur Fancy gets here.

10:05.842 --> 10:08.597
If I was lookin'
to get busy on you, Kwasi...

10:08.663 --> 10:10.522
that would've happened before.

10:10.587 --> 10:12.446
You gonna behave yourself
I take these cuffs off?

10:12.511 --> 10:14.816
I wanna make a phone call.
I wanna talk to my daughter.

10:14.883 --> 10:18.981
- What's her number?
- You don't get my daughter's number.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.855
- Oh, this guy's a gem.
- Wait a minute, Kwasi. You asked to use the phone.

10:22.929 --> 10:25.969
Once we know it's your daughter and not one
of your runnin'buddies, then we'll be straight.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.909
- You don't get the number.
- Then you don't get the phone call.

10:31.745 --> 10:33.637
When Fancy gets here,
send him in.

10:37.356 --> 10:40.657
Next time I lay eyes on that hump,
I got relocation plans for this phone.

10:43.286 --> 10:45.746
- Hey. You collar Brother Kwasi?
- Yeah.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.343
Not for the case.
Disorderly and resisting.

10:48.416 --> 10:50.721
How'd you do
on those gunshot victims?

10:50.788 --> 10:53.181
- Nobody saw anything.
- Nobody wants to say.

10:53.256 --> 10:55.562
We grabbed up a guy
named Bo-Bo Thomas.

10:55.628 --> 10:58.797
Liquor store owner saw him
running from the scene with a gun.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.658
- Where do you have him?
- Two. Here's my notes.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.835
- Thanks, Adrianne.
- Guy's got a great personality.

11:15.506 --> 11:18.292
Bo-Bo, my man.
What's happenin'?

11:18.356 --> 11:20.565
- How long I gotta be here?
- What?

11:20.634 --> 11:22.492
How long I gotta be here?

11:22.557 --> 11:25.859
- You answer a few questions, and you could be on your way.
- Cool.

11:27.494 --> 11:29.604
Hell of a thing
what happened today, huh?

11:29.674 --> 11:32.363
- I don't know nothin' about that.
- Oh, you were at the game.

11:32.432 --> 11:34.857
- Yeah, I was at the game.
- Speak up, Bo-Bo.

11:34.932 --> 11:36.790
I was at the game.

11:36.855 --> 11:39.993
- What'd you do when the shooting started?
- I ran.

11:40.061 --> 11:42.399
- You ran with your gun out?
- I ain't got no gun.

11:42.466 --> 11:44.836
- Somebody saw you with a gun.
- Oh, yeah? Who?

11:44.902 --> 11:47.624
You were running with a gun in your hand.
That's been established.

11:47.690 --> 11:49.549
What you got to do is explain why.

11:49.614 --> 11:51.854
Shots being fired every which way.

11:51.922 --> 11:54.228
- Makes sense that you'd wanna protect yourself.
- I ain't got no gun.

11:55.961 --> 11:59.317
You knew Lorenzo Gaines, didn't you?

11:59.393 --> 12:02.268
- Say Lorenzo Gaines?
- Yeah. Lorenzo Gaines.

12:02.342 --> 12:05.796
The guy that somebody shot point-blank in
the face in the middle of all this excitement.

12:05.869 --> 12:07.725
- You knew him, right?
- Mm-mmm.

12:07.791 --> 12:11.026
No? He used to sling dope
out of the Avenue D" projects.

12:11.092 --> 12:13.683
- You sling dope out of the Avenue D" projects.
- I don't sling no dope.

12:13.754 --> 12:17.021
Oh, you don't?
Well, I'm glad to hear that, Bo-Bo.

12:17.087 --> 12:19.427
'Cause slingin' dope-
That's a dangerous career path.

12:19.492 --> 12:21.535
And after gettin'to know you
a little bit here...

12:21.608 --> 12:25.642
I- I can't take the thought of seein' you
windin' up like poor Lorenzo.

12:27.666 --> 12:30.672
- What's so funny?
- Both y'all.

12:30.744 --> 12:33.302
- Your facts ain't too straight. That's it.
- No? In what way?

12:33.373 --> 12:36.346
Lorenzo Gaines ain't no dealer.

12:36.418 --> 12:38.309
No, not now, Bo-Bo,
'cause he's dead.

12:38.374 --> 12:43.303
But I had the pleasure of arrestin' that scumbag
myself with the crack in his pocket.

12:43.375 --> 12:47.890
- Not last year. He was out the game.
- Okay, so 13 months ago.

12:47.959 --> 12:51.096
But I thought you didn't know
any Lorenzo Gaines, Bo-Bo.

12:52.416 --> 12:54.328
I just seen him
around the projects.

12:54.403 --> 12:56.262
And he quit sellin' dope?

12:56.328 --> 12:58.502
Yeah. Too much drama.

12:58.571 --> 13:00.549
Why do you think he got
shot in the face today?

13:01.712 --> 13:03.691
Just his time to go, I guess.

13:05.047 --> 13:08.052
You know, y'all, uh,
ain't gonna arrest me.

13:09.470 --> 13:13.821
- I wanna go.
- No, no, no, no, no.

13:13.894 --> 13:17.162
See, you gotta walk us through it
one more time, Bo-Bo.

13:17.229 --> 13:21.578
Yeah. Make up some interestin' fib
why you weren't packin', hmm?

13:25.243 --> 13:27.997
That was the worst of it, Arthur.
I won't let it get to paperwork.

13:28.064 --> 13:30.239
- Yeah, all right.
- Just keep your head down.

13:30.307 --> 13:32.384
Don't look to these guys
for any favors the next few months.

13:32.456 --> 13:34.314
I don't expect favors from chiefs.

13:34.379 --> 13:37.734
From me, you get today back times 10.

13:37.809 --> 13:41.011
I know you could've looked to spread the blame.
I won't forget you for standing up.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.091
You wanna see where we are?

13:43.163 --> 13:46.038
No. I better keep an eye
on the puzzle palace.

13:46.113 --> 13:49.435
Arthur, I want you to jump on this,
work the hell out of it, clear it...

13:49.511 --> 13:51.303
and rub their noses in it.

13:51.369 --> 13:53.227
- Hmm?
- Yeah. All right.

13:53.293 --> 13:55.949
All right.

13:56.018 --> 13:58.357
Yeah. I will give him the message.

13:58.423 --> 14:01.496
- I'm back, Donna.
- Hold on. Lieutenant.

14:01.566 --> 14:04.352
- Yeah?
- Desk sergeant said a reporter just came in...

14:04.417 --> 14:08.200
claiming that Detectives Simone
and Sipowicz have one of his notebooks.

14:09.611 --> 14:11.469
What's the story, Sergeant?

14:11.535 --> 14:13.448
I appreciate the phone call.
Thank you.

14:13.523 --> 14:16.462
Hey. We just got
an anonymous tip.

14:16.536 --> 14:19.323
Charlton Moody's one of the shooters.

14:19.389 --> 14:22.395
- He's at Grey's Funeral Home with a couple bodyguards.
- Let's go get him.

14:22.467 --> 14:25.189
I bet he gets a volume deal
with the mortuaries.

14:25.256 --> 14:27.747
- How's it goin', Lieu?
- My office.

14:30.929 --> 14:33.585
We just got a push on Charlton Moody
for one of the shooters...

14:33.655 --> 14:35.513
and where to grab him up.

14:35.578 --> 14:38.267
And Brother Kwasi's in three.
He'll only talk to you.

14:38.335 --> 14:41.274
- He came in voluntarily?
- Not exactly.

14:41.349 --> 14:45.382
- What does that mean?
- He put his hands on Andy when we went to talk to him.

14:45.453 --> 14:48.360
So we collared him
for disorderly conduct and resisting.

14:48.434 --> 14:50.608
Can that go away if Kwasi
gives us something?

14:50.677 --> 14:52.339
Yeah, I guess it could go away.

14:53.851 --> 14:57.240
There's a reporter downstairs.
Says you guys have his notebook.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.516
Guy drops somethin'in the elevator.
Could've been a notebook.

15:00.584 --> 15:03.906
- I do not need this crap today.
- Lieu, that reporter's an eyeball witness...

15:03.982 --> 15:06.888
good enough that he's got blood all over
his clothes, and he doesn't wanna say what he saw.

15:06.962 --> 15:09.269
If the guy doesn't get
his notebook back, he's goin'...

15:09.335 --> 15:12.341
to the Deputy Commissioner for Public Information
to tell him you two stole it.

15:12.413 --> 15:15.452
Before you move on Moody, I want you
to go downstairs, talk to this guy...

15:15.523 --> 15:17.795
and work out a way
to help him find what he lost.

15:17.863 --> 15:20.867
Do we understand each other?

15:20.940 --> 15:22.919
Kwasi's in Interview 3.

15:22.992 --> 15:26.128
Probably wasn't
his current notebook anyway.

15:26.197 --> 15:29.465
Probably just background
on the game.

15:40.751 --> 15:42.610
I came upon that at the hospital.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.784
Maybe you could drop it
at their Lost and Found.

15:44.855 --> 15:48.407
- Meet you at the funeral parlor.
- Yeah, once I'm done lovin' up this hoopoe.

15:50.209 --> 15:52.188
- How's it goin'?
- Detective.

15:52.261 --> 15:54.753
- How ya doin', Dave?
- Seems like old times.

15:54.825 --> 15:58.094
I spent a lot of hours in this station house
afterJimmy Leggett died.

15:58.159 --> 16:01.461
I understand you, uh,
misplaced a notebook.

16:01.526 --> 16:03.601
- Yeah.
- Where'd you see it last, Dave?

16:03.673 --> 16:06.100
Well, it was in the pocket
of this coat here...

16:06.174 --> 16:09.442
and it was missin'after I got the coat back
from you and your partner at the elevator.

16:09.508 --> 16:12.644
You inquired as to its whereabouts
with the hospital personnel...

16:12.713 --> 16:14.440
janitorial and the like?

16:14.509 --> 16:16.782
Go get your ho-ho's, Detective,
because the notebook I lost...

16:16.849 --> 16:18.925
wasn't the one that quotes you
calling Kwasi a nigger.

16:18.998 --> 16:22.200
- I don't take your reference.
- Okay, whatever.

16:22.267 --> 16:24.660
Am I gonna get my notebook back,
or am I gonna file a complaint?

16:24.735 --> 16:27.521
You lost somethin' at the hospital.
Maybe you'd find it at Lost and Found.

16:27.589 --> 16:29.927
- Don't jerk me around on this, all right?
- Hey, kid.

16:29.993 --> 16:31.883
Two people are dead,
seven more shot.

16:31.948 --> 16:33.774
You think I wanna
waste more time with you?

16:33.839 --> 16:35.983
You were there.
You got a trained eye.

16:36.052 --> 16:38.675
But you don't wanna stumble
over your big journalistic principles...

16:38.745 --> 16:40.657
on cooperatin' with the authorities.

16:40.732 --> 16:43.191
Look, if I had knowledge of a crime
being committed, I'd put it in my story.

16:43.264 --> 16:45.757
If I got taken to court,
I'd testify that what I reported is accurate.

16:45.830 --> 16:49.000
- That's all I feel obliged to do.
- You sound like you're on the potty.

16:49.068 --> 16:52.456
- Go find your notebook.
- Don't you wanna call me a kike first?

16:56.088 --> 16:59.510
You wanna try screwin' me for somethin'
you think you heard, that's on you.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.921
- I'm workin' a case.
- I am too.

17:01.986 --> 17:04.260
Oh, yeah? You're goin' with
that agent provocateur" theory...

17:04.327 --> 17:06.884
you're gonna bust this thing wide open.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.723
Yeah, all right.

17:12.790 --> 17:14.801
No, I don't know how long.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.333
No, I don't need one
for this trumped-up nonsense.

17:18.592 --> 17:20.450
Yeah, all right.

17:24.267 --> 17:26.637
You wanna get
these charges dropped?

17:26.703 --> 17:29.610
Let's talk about the ball game, Kwasi.

17:29.684 --> 17:33.203
The healing event
you gave up to drug dealers.

17:33.274 --> 17:36.859
Let's talk about how Avenue D"
versus the Houston projects...

17:36.929 --> 17:40.131
turned into Petey Green's ringers
against Charlton Moody's.

17:40.199 --> 17:42.211
That game was a memorial
toJimmy Leggett.

17:42.283 --> 17:44.262
- Anybody gets to grieve.
- Who you talkin' to, Kwasi?

17:44.336 --> 17:47.210
That game wasn't a memorial,
and it wasn't grieving.

17:47.285 --> 17:50.356
It- It was a vanity tug-of-war
for gangsters.

17:50.426 --> 17:53.432
I sat down and talked
with those brothers like men.

17:53.504 --> 17:56.290
- It warn't about making trouble.
- You and I sat in a room.

17:56.356 --> 17:58.695
You think I'm God, Arthur? Huh?

17:58.762 --> 18:02.380
I mean, people I know,
people I see every day...

18:02.448 --> 18:04.306
You think I wanted them shot,
Iyin' in blood?

18:04.372 --> 18:06.229
That's what happened.
Who did it?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.951
That is for us to take care of
in the community.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.550
You couldn't take care of a ball game.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.153
You can't take care of your own cops.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.078
You got people workin' for you
that like to toss around nigger"...

18:15.143 --> 18:17.187
just like sayin', How you doin'?"

18:17.259 --> 18:20.231
Talkin' about how that gunfight
is just brothers acting their color.

18:20.304 --> 18:23.124
- Who said that?
- Bald asshole.

18:23.189 --> 18:26.096
- Gut and a stupid mustache.
- That's mine to deal with.

18:26.170 --> 18:29.308
It's cops like that that killed Jimmy Leggett
and lied to cover it up.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.070
The M.E. Said Jimmy Leggett
wasn't murdered.

18:31.140 --> 18:34.048
Boy, they got you wrapped up
like a Christmas present, don't they?

18:37.711 --> 18:40.466
You disappoint me so much, man.

18:40.534 --> 18:42.773
I want those shooters, Kwasi,
and if you don't know who they are...

18:42.840 --> 18:44.699
you can get in the street
and find out.

18:44.765 --> 18:46.622
- You gonna release me?
- You gonna work with me?

18:46.687 --> 18:48.863
I want that cracker with the mustache.
I want his badge.

18:48.932 --> 18:52.234
We clear these homicides, you get
your charges dropped. The rest is on me.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.818
That guy has no business walkin' around
with a license to kill, not in my neighborhood.

18:55.888 --> 18:58.576
- Can anyone verify him usin' that language?
- How about a reporter?

18:58.646 --> 19:00.559
You got a name?

19:01.787 --> 19:05.089
Jewish kid- David Bloom.
Writes for the View.

19:05.153 --> 19:07.776
- We're talkin' about Detective Sipowicz?
- Sounds right.

19:07.846 --> 19:11.628
- Am I released?
- I want those shooters.

19:11.694 --> 19:14.666
I feel like
we'll work somethin' out.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.559
Yeah.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.050
You're released.

19:52.086 --> 19:54.611
Nah.

19:54.683 --> 19:56.661
- How much is this, man?
- $8,800.

19:56.735 --> 19:59.389
All right, guys. Police. Just relax.
Put your hands where we can see them.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.635
On the casket! Put your hands on the casket.

20:01.703 --> 20:03.944
- What do y'all want?
- I want you to be quiet.

20:04.011 --> 20:06.536
You see? This is wrong.
You're gonna have to come in with us.

20:06.607 --> 20:08.466
- I got another piece here.
- Right here, James.

20:08.532 --> 20:10.641
Why do I have to come in?
Ain't no weapons on me.

20:10.711 --> 20:12.854
That's a very interesting
point there, Charlton.

20:12.923 --> 20:15.098
Whose funeral you plannin'anyways?

20:15.167 --> 20:16.994
Not my own.
I want my lawyer.

20:17.060 --> 20:20.065
I want your tailor.
Come on. Let's go.

20:25.522 --> 20:27.598
- I'm gonna run it through Fancy.
- Yeah.

20:27.671 --> 20:30.545
Lieu. This Moody-
He just lawyered up.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.309
We're gonna have to talk to his guy.
How you want me and Andy to play it?

20:33.377 --> 20:36.466
- Both of you come in here a second.
- Okay. Andy.

20:38.840 --> 20:43.191
I'm figurin' maybe we hint
there's an eyewitness, somethin' like that.

20:43.266 --> 20:45.571
Yeah. You can do that.

20:47.176 --> 20:49.088
Close the door.

20:51.408 --> 20:53.867
So, what's up?

20:53.940 --> 20:56.793
I'm takin' you off the case.
Russell will work with you.

20:56.857 --> 20:59.709
- What's this about?
- It's about you showin' your ass in public.

20:59.775 --> 21:03.394
Decidin'to call someone whose help we need
to clear this case a nigger.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.154
This Kwasi told you
I called him that?

21:05.224 --> 21:07.498
He said you called him that
in front of that reporter from the View.

21:07.565 --> 21:11.215
I'd call him to find out what happened,
except he'd ask me for a statement.

21:11.283 --> 21:13.775
I guess me and the commissioner
have to read about it next week.

21:13.848 --> 21:16.920
- This guy was provokin' the hell outta both of us.
- You call him a nigger too?

21:16.989 --> 21:20.443
I did not call him that. He called himself that,
and I threw it back at him.

21:20.516 --> 21:22.462
He said somethin' like...

21:22.535 --> 21:25.770
I'm the one nigger
you cops can't mess with."

21:25.838 --> 21:28.974
- I threw it back at him how he's the one caused these shootings.
- The one nigger.

21:29.042 --> 21:31.502
- I was throwin' it back at him!
- You don't get to throw that back.

21:31.575 --> 21:34.068
I been partner with Andy-
what, a year and a half?

21:34.141 --> 21:36.184
I have never heard him use that word before.
It was off the guy.

21:36.256 --> 21:38.082
Save your breath, Bobby.

21:38.147 --> 21:40.223
- You want me catchin'other cases?
- For now.

21:44.239 --> 21:46.632
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to take a message.

21:49.464 --> 21:51.322
- Can you believe that?
- Just be cool, Andy.

21:51.388 --> 21:54.623
Be cool? You were there.
You saw the context how that happened.

21:56.518 --> 21:58.660
Well, I guess Fancy's
just actin' his color.

22:01.710 --> 22:04.048
What you said in that elevator...

22:04.113 --> 22:06.508
'bout those lowlife homeys
decidin' to act black.

22:06.584 --> 22:11.097
- You got a problem with me too?
- Partner, I was not comfortable with those words.

22:11.167 --> 22:13.178
I am not comfortable
with the thoughts behind it.

22:13.252 --> 22:15.109
I just want you to understand that.

22:15.174 --> 22:19.558
So Kwasi can break my balls. When I decide
to give a little back, I'm the asshole.

22:19.632 --> 22:22.090
- Givin' it back-Was that all it was?
- Do me a favor, all right?

22:22.163 --> 22:24.022
Finish your sermon another time.

22:32.004 --> 22:35.688
How far you think I can bluff this drug lawyer
with this weak-ass hand we got?

22:35.755 --> 22:38.542
- I don't know. Ask somebody less bigoted.
- Come on, Andy.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.581
Go talk to Moody's lawyer.

22:46.430 --> 22:49.282
Diane, wanna work this with me?

22:57.491 --> 23:00.366
- How's it goin'? Bobby Simone.
- Mike Alvarado.

23:00.441 --> 23:03.447
- This is Diane Russell.
- How you doin'?

23:03.518 --> 23:05.375
Is Mr. Moody being charged?

23:05.441 --> 23:07.747
If you got two minutes,
I'd like to lay out your guy's situation.

23:07.814 --> 23:10.240
I'd like him charged or released.

23:12.719 --> 23:14.577
Don't you wanna know
what this is about, Mike?

23:14.642 --> 23:17.035
We picked up Charlton
at the funeral home.

23:17.110 --> 23:18.836
He's makin'arrangements
for this Eddie Holloway...

23:18.906 --> 23:21.211
which Eddie was executed
at this basketball game.

23:21.278 --> 23:24.513
Muzzle of a.380 flush up against
the back of the head.

23:24.580 --> 23:26.952
And then- I don't know
if you heard about this, Mike...

23:27.016 --> 23:29.192
all hell breaks loose.

23:29.261 --> 23:31.566
And Charlton's name keeps comin' up
in a lot of statements.

23:31.632 --> 23:34.802
What he oughta understand
is that his bodyguard got capped...

23:34.870 --> 23:37.593
and we recognize there could be
a scenario here for self-defense.

23:37.659 --> 23:40.446
Charge or release.

23:40.513 --> 23:43.748
The D.A.'s makin' that call
right now, Mike.

23:43.815 --> 23:45.827
Maybe you could use the time
to talk to Charlton.

23:45.899 --> 23:48.587
You know, lay out what we've got,
self-defense scenario.

23:48.656 --> 23:51.694
He cooperates,
it could be close to a walk.

23:51.765 --> 23:54.356
Of course, that isn't your call, is it?

23:54.426 --> 23:57.596
It's our strong impression, right?

23:57.664 --> 24:00.189
Conversations with the D.A., Mike.

24:00.261 --> 24:02.917
If you want to convey that.

24:04.204 --> 24:07.340
- Where is he?
- Interview room next door.

24:21.002 --> 24:22.914
Sit over here, all right?

24:25.233 --> 24:27.344
We'll be back in a second.

24:27.413 --> 24:30.418
Hey, guys. That girl over there
could be an eyewitness.

24:30.491 --> 24:32.863
I know the day guy
at the rec center on Houston Street.

24:32.928 --> 24:36.098
He beeps me, says she's been tellin' people
she was at the game and saw one of the murders.

24:36.166 --> 24:38.625
- She's cooperating?
- The guy says she's been in and out of trouble...

24:38.698 --> 24:40.677
so Greg and I ran her through B.C.I.

24:40.749 --> 24:42.762
She's got a shoplifting beef
pending family court.

24:42.834 --> 24:45.358
- We brought her in off of that.
- She won't get a day off that charge.

24:45.429 --> 24:48.731
- She's a tough read, but I think we could tip her.
- Mind if we watch?

24:48.795 --> 24:50.906
Nah. Maybe you could
pick up some pointers.

24:56.266 --> 24:58.179
You guys wanna come with us?

25:05.017 --> 25:09.883
- I didn't see nothin'. Somebody said I did, they Iying.
- Let's have a seat over here.

25:12.006 --> 25:14.378
Here we go.

25:14.442 --> 25:17.677
What people say, Shirelle,
is what you've been sayin' yourself.

25:17.745 --> 25:20.848
- You saw somebody get killed.
- I didn't see nothin'.

25:20.917 --> 25:23.606
If she says she didn't see anything,
then she didn't see anything.

25:23.675 --> 25:25.534
Here's the situation, Miss McCIintock.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.091
This shoplifting matter-
Your daughter's lookin'at a year...

25:28.162 --> 25:30.655
in thejuvenile house of detention
for that.

25:30.728 --> 25:32.772
Ayear? For shopliftin'?

25:32.844 --> 25:35.883
It's her third offense.
The district attorney has discretion.

25:35.953 --> 25:39.407
We can urge them to dismiss the case
if Shirelle will testify against the shooter.

25:39.480 --> 25:43.032
- Testify?
- Ayear in jail is not somethin' you want, Shirelle.

25:43.103 --> 25:46.043
Whatever wrong you've done, this is
your chance to turn around from that...

25:46.116 --> 25:49.351
and get your life on the right track
by sayin' what you saw in that game.

25:49.418 --> 25:51.427
What kinda life I'm-a have if I rat?

25:51.500 --> 25:54.539
Is it a matter of you bein' scared?

25:54.611 --> 25:57.431
We can place you
in protective custody...

25:57.496 --> 25:59.836
- you and your mother- till after the trial.
- And what about after that?

25:59.901 --> 26:03.901
If necessary, we could get you moved
to another part of the city.

26:03.972 --> 26:06.147
Did you see somethin'?

26:09.102 --> 26:12.851
Answer me!
Do you wanna go to prison?

26:17.148 --> 26:19.007
Y'all gonna have to protect me.

26:19.073 --> 26:22.493
- We'll protect you.
- What'd you see, Shirelle?

26:22.566 --> 26:27.463
It was wrong, that man gettin' killed
in front of his own son.

26:27.534 --> 26:29.709
- Who?
- That man.

26:29.778 --> 26:33.200
He was watchin' the game
with his little boy, like, four years old.

26:33.273 --> 26:35.929
Then there was a gunshot,
and people started running.

26:35.998 --> 26:39.038
While he was trying to keep his son from
gettin' stepped on and trampled and stuff...

26:39.109 --> 26:43.972
this guy came up and stuck a gun
this close to his face and just shot him.

26:45.744 --> 26:47.919
- You saw who shot him?
- Yeah.

26:49.270 --> 26:52.407
Somebody you recognize?

26:56.643 --> 26:58.272
Charlton Moody.

27:02.703 --> 27:05.095
Good answer, Shirelle.

27:05.203 --> 27:10.427
Well, I don't know, Lillian.
Not till we make some kind of progress.

27:10.493 --> 27:15.390
No, I don't wanna decide what to do
about him while I'm still pissed off.

27:15.462 --> 27:19.463
I wasn't there, Lillian. I don't know
if it was malicious or just stupid.

27:21.103 --> 27:23.279
Um, yeah. I'll talk to you later.

27:23.347 --> 27:25.261
Yeah, I love you.

27:27.258 --> 27:29.946
- I see he's still at his desk.
- He's not workin' this case.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.442
- Is he turned in yet?
- You had your say on Sipowicz.

27:32.518 --> 27:36.232
My say? I finally get some leverage to get
one racist cop outta this sick department...

27:36.300 --> 27:40.879
You had your say with me, Kwasi. Whatever
else you do with Sipowicz, that's up to you.

27:40.948 --> 27:42.805
And the kid from the Village View.

27:42.870 --> 27:46.357
I'm hopin' you're here to get right with what
happened on that basketball court.

27:53.002 --> 27:56.937
What I'm hearin' is a young knucklehead
named Bo-Bo Thomas.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.249
He deals in the projects
with Petey Green.

27:59.316 --> 28:03.000
Steps up behind Holloway,
who's bodyguardin' Charlton Moody...

28:03.066 --> 28:05.014
and blows Holloway's brains out.

28:05.087 --> 28:07.393
- Was it a hit?
- I don't know.

28:07.459 --> 28:10.246
But his bodyguard goes down,
Moody takes out Lorenzo Gaines.

28:10.312 --> 28:12.651
Our Narcotics people say Gaines didn't
work for Petey Green anymore.

28:12.716 --> 28:14.628
Maybe somebody
should've told Moody.

28:14.703 --> 28:18.869
Arthur, you sayJimmy Leggett
died of a seizure.

28:18.937 --> 28:21.209
I say some cop
choked him to death.

28:21.275 --> 28:23.352
All I knew is big thing
everybody said about him...

28:23.424 --> 28:25.698
The boy was crazy for basketball.

28:25.764 --> 28:29.283
- So you wanted to give him a game.
- Yes.

28:29.355 --> 28:33.901
Some people get behind, and maybe
some kids get some new sneakers.

28:33.971 --> 28:36.791
Except that you turn around, and...

28:36.856 --> 28:38.901
the kids aren't playin'.

28:38.973 --> 28:43.388
The dealers...
got their own squads.

28:43.460 --> 28:46.947
Is there any way I can
get anybody on record...

28:47.019 --> 28:49.259
on Bo-Bo pullin' the first trigger?

28:51.699 --> 28:53.907
Not through me.

29:09.363 --> 29:11.756
I got you dead in my sights.

29:11.833 --> 29:15.221
You a shooter too, Kwasi,
just like your drug-dealin' pals?

29:15.294 --> 29:18.529
No, I'm a practical man.

29:18.596 --> 29:21.384
I know that if it's just my word,
I got no chance goin' after you.

29:21.450 --> 29:23.657
So I must be livin' right.

29:23.725 --> 29:27.923
You poppin' off in front
of a white-liberal reporter.

29:27.989 --> 29:30.993
Geez, Kwasi, you mean that kid
might load the dice against me?

29:31.066 --> 29:33.340
He might not write
how I wasn't cursin' you...

29:33.406 --> 29:35.799
how you used that word first?

29:35.875 --> 29:38.051
You're gonna pay for every single cop
that ever called me nigger...

29:38.119 --> 29:40.676
back when I was just Kenny Parker
growin' up in the projects.

29:40.748 --> 29:44.136
Fill the boat up, Kwasi.
Your difficult childhood, Kunta Kinte...

29:44.210 --> 29:46.964
Martin Luther King gettin' shot.

29:47.031 --> 29:49.305
You don't wanna make it
just simple stuff like man-to-man.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.766
You figure I insulted you,
so we throw down.

29:51.841 --> 29:55.841
Just man-to-man...
here in your station house.

29:55.912 --> 29:58.283
Just name the time and place.
I will tune you up anywhere you want.

29:58.348 --> 30:00.807
- Step away, Andy.
- I'm a practical man.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.891
Kwasi! You got
any more business here?

30:02.963 --> 30:05.522
Kwasi's decidin' does he want
an honest shot at workin' out...

30:05.592 --> 30:07.636
his bad feelings he's got for cops.

30:07.710 --> 30:10.201
Shut up, Sipowicz.

30:13.319 --> 30:15.910
You got my back?

30:26.175 --> 30:28.567
That kid you cut loose before-
Bo-Bo Thomas.

30:28.642 --> 30:30.751
The witness backed off
on seein' him packin'.

30:30.822 --> 30:33.477
We got an anonymous tip
he threw the first shot.

30:33.546 --> 30:37.197
- Took out Charlton Moody's bodyguard.
- Want me to pick him back up?

30:37.266 --> 30:39.125
Yeah. Take Russell and Martinez.

30:45.762 --> 30:49.116
Either you shut your mouth to anyone
involved in this case or get the hell out.

31:15.510 --> 31:18.200
Bo-Bo. Don't you move.

31:18.269 --> 31:19.929
- Come on, man.
- Police. Don't move.

31:19.998 --> 31:22.108
Get up against the wall.
Hands flat against the wall.

31:22.179 --> 31:24.737
- Go.
- I told you I didn't do nothin'.

31:24.808 --> 31:28.163
- You're gonna have to tell us again.
- Yeah. Check this out.

31:28.239 --> 31:30.096
- A.380?
- Hey, man, that ain't mine.

31:30.162 --> 31:32.140
Oh, yeah. I never heard that before, bra.
It's a new one.

31:32.213 --> 31:34.126
Now what, Bo-Bo?
You're under arrest.

31:34.201 --> 31:36.507
- Hey, you're crazy.
- Shut up.

31:49.044 --> 31:52.498
See, we got your gun. And Ballistics
is gonna match your gun up...

31:52.570 --> 31:54.461
with that slug that we pulled
out of Eddie's skull.

31:54.525 --> 31:57.115
You know what that means?
Lights out for Bo-Bo.

31:57.186 --> 32:01.537
- Yeah, but Bo-Bo didn't do noth-
- Shut up!

32:01.610 --> 32:03.555
Was this a hit?

32:03.630 --> 32:05.489
We know you work
for Petey Green, Bo-Bo.

32:05.554 --> 32:07.413
Did your boss
put a contract on this guy?

32:07.478 --> 32:09.204
The only option you got right now
is to tell the truth.

32:09.272 --> 32:12.923
- I didn't do it.
- You did it, and I'm sick of you sittin' here Iyin' to me.

32:12.991 --> 32:15.068
I didn't do nothin'.

32:15.139 --> 32:18.144
- You hauled ass after that little execution of yours.
- No.

32:18.216 --> 32:21.637
But I was on that basketball court there
cleanin' up the mess.

32:21.710 --> 32:24.848
You were lookin' to start
a bloodbath there?

32:24.916 --> 32:27.737
'Cause there was a whole lot of innocent
people who got shot today, Bo-Bo...

32:27.802 --> 32:31.453
includin' women, and I'm hopin' that you're
man enough that that'll bother you.

32:33.444 --> 32:35.783
Well, if that don't mean much to you,
maybe this will.

32:35.848 --> 32:38.636
- What?
- If you don't start tellin' me the truth right now...

32:38.702 --> 32:40.845
I'm gonna start bouncin' your ass
up against these walls!

32:40.913 --> 32:43.853
- You understand me now? You understand me now?
- Yeah, I understand you.

32:43.927 --> 32:46.549
Well? Well?

32:46.620 --> 32:49.112
- He had it comin'.
- He had it comin'? Eddie Holloway had it comin'?

32:49.185 --> 32:51.130
- Yeah. Punk shot Fruit Loop.
- Who the hell's Fruit Loop?

32:51.204 --> 32:53.730
- My cousin!
- Eddie Holloway shot Fruit Loop?

32:53.801 --> 32:55.975
- When?
- September.

32:56.044 --> 32:58.733
- And you went and you shot him at this basketball game?
- Yeah.

33:09.893 --> 33:13.445
- Andy Sipowicz, ladies and gentlemen.
- How's it goin', Gotelli?

33:13.516 --> 33:16.424
I hear the bosses came down on Fancy
behind this basketball mess, huh?

33:16.498 --> 33:19.569
It shouldn't have taken Einstein
to figure that game was bad news.

33:19.639 --> 33:21.783
- Couple a hundred.
- Yeah, there you go.

33:22.813 --> 33:25.501
Ah. Sarge said there were collars.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.581
They're talkin' to one guy,
runnin' a lineup on another one.

33:27.654 --> 33:30.507
- You're not workin' it?
- If I was, Vince, would I be here talkin' to you?

33:30.571 --> 33:33.643
- Whoa. Andy.
- You're sure no Einstein either.

33:43.588 --> 33:45.695
Recognize anybody, Shirelle?

33:45.766 --> 33:47.942
Remember, no one can see you.

33:49.710 --> 33:52.268
- Two.
- What?

33:52.338 --> 33:55.246
Number two.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.495
Where you recognize
number two from?

33:57.564 --> 34:00.057
- From the basketball court this morning.
- What did he do?

34:00.129 --> 34:03.004
He shot a man in the face
in front of his little boy.

34:07.022 --> 34:08.715
All right.
You guys can relax for a while.

34:08.784 --> 34:12.107
We appreciate this.
The district attorney will get you situated.

34:12.183 --> 34:13.844
We're just gonna be a few minutes.

34:13.914 --> 34:16.438
- Where's Andy?
- He's in the squad.

34:27.954 --> 34:30.895
Hi.

34:30.969 --> 34:33.877
- That girl make the I. D?
- Yeah. I thought you were working that case.

34:33.951 --> 34:36.222
- I'm off the case.
- How come?

34:36.290 --> 34:39.197
I got into a beef with that...
Brother Kwasi.

34:39.271 --> 34:41.130
So Fancy took you off the case?

34:41.196 --> 34:44.496
I don't know if I can even keep workin' for him-
gettin' slapped in the face like this.

34:44.561 --> 34:47.283
- What kind of beef was it?
- Some language.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.328
Racial language.

34:49.402 --> 34:52.221
Excuse me.
Ms. Costas, we'll be downstairs, huh?

34:54.050 --> 34:56.543
We're gonna put them in a hotel tonight,
so I've gotta deal with the paperwork.

34:56.614 --> 34:58.473
- Yeah, all right.
- I'll see you at home?

34:58.538 --> 35:02.090
- All right.
- And we'll talk about this?

35:06.296 --> 35:08.722
- We'll get through this, Andy.
- Yeah.

35:42.328 --> 35:45.400
- Finish with Bo-Bo? -
Yeah. - Just signed off.

35:45.471 --> 35:47.314
- I'll get my coat.
- Yeah, good.

35:50.648 --> 35:53.785
You gotta do this tonight, Andy?

35:53.854 --> 35:55.897
Wouldn't it be better
tojust sleep on it?

35:55.969 --> 35:57.794
No.

36:00.234 --> 36:02.376
You got a minute for me?

36:06.710 --> 36:08.982
- Good night, guys.
- Yeah, night, Bobby.

36:09.048 --> 36:10.907
- Good night, Lieu. Good night, Andy.
- Good night.

36:10.972 --> 36:12.632
Yeah.

36:12.702 --> 36:18.344
- Give us a minute here, Vince.
- Sure. Anybody want a soda from downstairs?

36:24.244 --> 36:26.966
It would've been smarter for you
to go home when the shift ended.

36:29.919 --> 36:33.023
If you're goin' after me,
you bring charges or let Kwasi do it.

36:33.093 --> 36:35.747
'Cause I want a chance to answer him
in front of somebody besides you.

36:35.817 --> 36:37.993
Yeah, this is about me, Andy.
I'm the racist.

36:38.061 --> 36:40.651
I've said that word.
I've thought it plenty.

36:40.722 --> 36:44.439
But I've never used it on the job
till your hump pal put us on that road.

36:44.504 --> 36:47.227
This isn't about a word, Andy,
or your impure thoughts.

36:47.294 --> 36:49.152
This is about you makin'
this case harder to work.

36:49.218 --> 36:51.873
Not about you bein' black?
Not about givin' some back to me?

36:51.942 --> 36:54.019
- It's about what I say it's about.
- Then say.

36:54.090 --> 36:55.948
Part of what it's about
is watchin' me sweat.

36:56.013 --> 36:58.538
A hell of a lot went down today,
so I'd have to check my notes.

36:58.610 --> 37:01.234
But I thought I spent some of that time
tryin' to save your sorry ass.

37:01.304 --> 37:03.894
- Give me a break.
- I'm not gonna take you out, Andy.

37:03.964 --> 37:06.587
I move you out, my white bosses-
They send me a little message.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.570
They send me another one
just like you...

37:08.644 --> 37:10.852
but maybe that one
can't do the job like you can.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.615
Geez, thanks a lot, boss.

37:12.684 --> 37:16.039
If you go, it'll be somebody
like Kwasi or like that reporter.

37:16.114 --> 37:18.671
I been dealin' with white cops like you
ever since the academy.

37:18.742 --> 37:20.502
I can manage you
with my eyes closed.

37:20.570 --> 37:23.477
Now, maybe you can't handle
a black man being your boss.

37:23.551 --> 37:26.338
I can handle it. I've been covering you
three and a half years.

37:26.405 --> 37:28.864
Except when you get so tied up
in your brother-brother crap...

37:28.937 --> 37:30.598
you won't let us work the streets.

37:30.668 --> 37:32.493
That's when you get
yourself in trouble.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.565
Hey, Lieu. We got a report of a person
shot near the Houston Street projects.

37:35.638 --> 37:37.430
- Want me to handle it?
- Was it a homicide?

37:37.497 --> 37:40.022
- I don't know.
- That teenage girl, the eyewitness.

37:40.094 --> 37:42.915
- Isn't she in those projects?
- Yeah. I think we got 'em out though.

37:42.980 --> 37:45.187
Sylvia was involved there.

37:45.254 --> 37:47.561
Check it out.

37:48.941 --> 37:51.149
- You want me to check it out?
- Yeah.

37:53.365 --> 37:55.223
Sipowicz will handle it.

38:24.494 --> 38:27.117
- What do you got?
- A guy's fired on while he's walking down the block.

38:27.186 --> 38:29.745
Gets to his car,
tries to drive himself to the hospital.

38:29.816 --> 38:32.756
Multiple wounds. Guy's bleedin'like crazy.
Looks like he's goin'out.

38:32.829 --> 38:35.199
- Anybody else shot?
- Not as far as we know. He's a reporter.

38:35.265 --> 38:39.233
- Who shot ya?
- They-They were in a car.

38:39.305 --> 38:41.643
I didn't see 'em.
I'll tell you who it had to be.

38:41.709 --> 38:45.097
- Charlton Moody.
- Charlton Moody's in custody.

38:45.171 --> 38:47.662
It had to be his guys.
'Cause I saw what happened at the game.

38:47.735 --> 38:51.254
- Okay.
- I'd be Iying if I told you I recognized anybody.

38:51.325 --> 38:54.080
- Can you describe the car?
- Dark-Dark- Dark color.

38:54.147 --> 38:56.640
Listen- Listen,
you write this down.

38:56.713 --> 38:59.717
I know how to help you,
'cause I'm- I'm gonna die.

38:59.790 --> 39:01.964
- You write this down.
- You calm down.

39:02.034 --> 39:04.077
They're workin' on you.

39:04.150 --> 39:07.604
This-This is a dying-
dying declaration.

39:07.676 --> 39:09.818
All right? Charlton Moody...

39:09.889 --> 39:15.046
I saw him... today...
shoot a man... point-blank.

39:15.112 --> 39:18.151
- Blood pressure's dropping.
- At the ball game.

39:18.222 --> 39:22.190
Whoever started it shouldn't have done that.
He shouldn't have done that.

39:22.262 --> 39:24.722
Oh, God.

39:24.794 --> 39:27.134
You're gonna write this
in your story, kid.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.626
You're not gonna die.
They're gonna fix you up, all right?

39:29.699 --> 39:31.557
All right. Okay.

39:31.622 --> 39:35.240
- Okay?
- You're gonna have to let us work on him here.

39:35.309 --> 39:39.113
His blood pressure's bottomed out.
Let's get him outta here.

39:41.112 --> 39:44.118
- We're losin'him.
- Let's get him on O2.

39:44.189 --> 39:46.047
- Give me a hand with the gurney.
- You get it?

39:46.114 --> 39:48.452
- Yeah. This kid's gone.
- I need the ambu bag over here.

39:48.517 --> 39:50.726
- Who is it?
- That reporter.

39:50.794 --> 39:54.860
It occurred to him a little late that Moody's
people might be gunnin' for witnesses.

39:54.929 --> 39:57.683
- Where's Sylvia?
- Guess she wasn't here.

39:57.751 --> 40:01.685
Kid corroborated Moody from
the second shooting. Cop wrote it down.

40:01.757 --> 40:04.828
Okay. I'll get the night watch
to handle this.

40:06.822 --> 40:09.545
Watch the I. V.

40:11.310 --> 40:13.224
Swing it around. Let's go.
Watch your back, people.

40:16.728 --> 40:18.674
Head first.

40:40.099 --> 40:42.013
- Hi, Andy.
- Sorry I'm late.

40:42.087 --> 40:43.878
We had a shooting near those projects.

40:43.946 --> 40:47.213
I was afraid Moody might
send somebody after that girl.

40:47.280 --> 40:50.067
No. We got her into a motel.

40:50.132 --> 40:53.685
Winds up they killed the reporter
who was at the game.

40:53.756 --> 40:56.128
He witnessed the murder.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.531
What happened
with you and Fancy?

40:59.975 --> 41:02.467
This guy Kwasi-
We're mixin' it up.

41:02.539 --> 41:05.709
He throws out the N" word.
I throw it back at him.

41:05.777 --> 41:07.985
Fancy comes at me
like I killed somebody.

41:08.053 --> 41:11.288
- Is it gonna come to charges?
- Not from him.

41:11.355 --> 41:13.268
He wants to watch me
walk on eggs.

41:13.343 --> 41:15.901
And the kid heard me,
but he's dead.

41:18.247 --> 41:20.805
I don't know where
this Kwasi'll go with it.

41:20.876 --> 41:23.183
Let him bring charges.

41:25.364 --> 41:28.666
- You ever hear me use that word?
- No.

41:29.980 --> 41:32.090
But I have seen you do this.

41:32.161 --> 41:36.162
That's not the same thing. That's something
cops do so you don't have to mention race.

41:36.233 --> 41:38.539
'Hey, did you hear about the shooting
at this barber shop?"

41:38.606 --> 41:40.430
This barber shop?"
Yeah."

41:40.495 --> 41:42.572
So it doesn't have to be said
and nobody gets offended.

41:42.644 --> 41:44.622
Andy, it's code for the word.

41:44.694 --> 41:47.066
It's code so you don't
have to say it.

41:52.582 --> 41:54.757
Don't ever show that to our child.

41:58.865 --> 42:01.937
- Yeah, all right.
- Don't teach him that.

42:03.193 --> 42:07.510
- Don't teach him to think that way.
- Yeah.
