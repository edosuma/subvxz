WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:03.003
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:03.046 --> 00:05.353
INDRA: I SAW HIM ONCE,
SHEIDHEDA.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.224
I WAS ONLY A GIRL
WHEN HE TOOK TRIKRU.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.052
HE WENT FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE

00:09.096 --> 00:11.620
BUTCHERING ANYONE
WHO REFUSED TO KNEEL.

00:11.663 --> 00:14.884
WE CANNOT LET THIS CREATURE
COMMAND WONKRU.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.538
RUSSHEDA: YOU
AND THE PRISONERS

00:16.581 --> 00:18.844
SHARE AN ENEMY, PERHAPS
EVEN THE SAME GOAL.

00:18.888 --> 00:22.674
THEY WANT POWER.
HOW DO WE DO IT?

00:22.718 --> 00:24.459
YOU MAKE ALLIES

00:24.502 --> 00:26.417
OF THE MURDERERS
AND THE THIEVES.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.071
JOIN US.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.595
A LITTLE DEPROGRAMMING,
SOME REVENGE,

00:30.639 --> 00:32.597
WE'LL SPLIT
THIS PLACE 50/50.

00:35.948 --> 00:38.081
PARTNERS?

00:38.125 --> 00:41.389
I'M WITH YOU...

00:41.432 --> 00:43.173
AND SO ARE
MY PEOPLE.

00:43.217 --> 00:46.829
GOOD CHOICE.
ALL COGs GET GUNS.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.178
HOW DOES IT WORK?

00:48.222 --> 00:49.527
WELL, YOU KILLED
MY BEST FRIEND,

00:49.571 --> 00:50.746
SO I'M NOT SURE
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.052
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

00:52.095 --> 00:53.270
OUR OTHER FRIENDS,
BRING THEM HERE.

00:53.314 --> 00:55.620
SEND IN
THEIR FRIENDS.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.931
ANDERS: I KNOW YOU'VE ONLY
AGREED TO DISCIPLE TRAINING

01:01.974 --> 01:03.802
TO GET OUT OF YOUR CELLS.

01:03.846 --> 01:06.240
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE BLIND
TO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

01:06.283 --> 01:10.287
I'M ABOUT TO OPEN YOUR EYES
TO THE TRUTH OF OUR CAUSE.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.597
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.686
I REALIZE THAT TAKING
THINGS ON FAITH

01:17.729 --> 01:19.905
IS NOT IN YOUR NATURE,
SO I'M GONNA SHOW YOU

01:19.949 --> 01:22.821
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE
LOSE THE LAST WAR.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.390
SURFACE.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.047
VOICE:
ACCESS GRANTED.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.484
HOPE: YOU ARE PRETTY BRAVE,
TAKING US YOURSELF.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.704
IT'S NOT
BRAVERY, HOPE.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.749
YOU SEE, THIS ELEVATOR
WILL STAY ON THE SURFACE

01:37.793 --> 01:40.535
UNTIL I SIGNAL FOR IT
TO BE BROUGHT DOWN.

01:40.578 --> 01:44.452
I TAKE IT ON FAITH THAT
YOU'D RATHER NOT DIE TODAY.

01:46.671 --> 01:49.500
GOOD.
THEN MASKS ON.

01:49.544 --> 01:53.417
THE PARTICULATE MATTER
IN THE AIR IS LETHAL TO HUMANS.

01:53.461 --> 01:57.073
IT'LL LITERALLY CALCIFY YOU
FROM THE INSIDE.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.172
GABRIEL SAVED US.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.608
WHERE IS GABRIEL?

02:10.651 --> 02:13.307
GABRIEL IS NO LONGER
YOUR CONCERN.

02:20.923 --> 02:23.795
ECHO: THIS IS WHAT
YOU'RE PREPARING TO FIGHT?

02:23.839 --> 02:28.148
NO. THE BARDOANS
LOST THEIR LAST WAR.

02:28.191 --> 02:33.022
THIS IS ALL
THAT IS LEFT.

02:36.199 --> 02:39.333
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.726
THE 10-FOOT ALIENS
WITH SUPERIOR TECHNOLOGY

02:41.770 --> 02:44.251
THAT BUILT THIS PLACE

02:44.294 --> 02:47.210
GOT GENOCIDED
AND TURNED TO STONE

02:47.254 --> 02:50.866
BY THE ENEMY
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.476
PRECISELY.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.739
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRAINING FOR.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.832
I DO LOVE ME
AN UNWINNABLE WAR.

03:52.493 --> 03:55.191
NIKKI: ANYTIME.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.280
EMORI: JUST SIT TIGHT.
I KNOW IT'S SCARY,

03:57.324 --> 03:58.716
BUT WE'LL FIND
A WAY OUT OF THIS.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.022
YOU STAY QUIET, OK?

04:00.065 --> 04:01.284
- NO!
- MADI...

04:02.981 --> 04:06.115
AREN'T YOU A SPITFIRE?
BUT YOU NEED TO CALM YOURSELF.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.423
WE'RE JUST GONNA
CHAT...FOR NOW.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.956
THIS THING ON?

04:20.999 --> 04:22.697
ON P.A.: GOOD EVENING, SANCTUM.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.875
THIS IS NIKKI AT THE MIC

04:26.918 --> 04:29.704
WITH MY FRIEND NELSON
BESIDE ME.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.143
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR PATIENCE,

04:34.186 --> 04:36.450
BUT WE HAVE
SOME REQUESTS.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.974
WE WOULD LIKE TO
EXTEND AN INVITATION

04:39.017 --> 04:42.020
TO RUSSELL
AND DANIEL PRIME

04:42.064 --> 04:46.982
AND RAVEN REYES
TO MEET US AT THE PALACE.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.810
YOU HAVE 20 MINUTES
TO GET HERE,

04:48.853 --> 04:51.116
OR WE START
KILLING HOSTAGES.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.293
WANT TO TAKE A GUESS
WHO'LL BE FIRST?

04:53.336 --> 04:54.946
I'LL LET HER
INTRODUCE HERSELF.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.868
THIS IS KAYLEE PRIME.

05:03.912 --> 05:06.784
DANIEL, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO DO--

05:06.828 --> 05:10.135
NIKKI: UH-UH.

05:10.179 --> 05:12.529
What we talked about.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.664
Fine.

05:28.110 --> 05:30.808
I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU

05:30.852 --> 05:34.725
THAT I'M LOOKING AT A GUN
POINTED AT MY HEAD,

05:34.769 --> 05:37.424
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO ANYTHING STUPID.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.687
- DAMN IT.
- MURPHY, WAIT.

05:39.730 --> 05:43.168
YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID.
DON'T BE STUPID.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.301
NIKKI, ON P.A.:
SHE'S BRAVE. I'LL GIVE HER THAT.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.695
BE A SHAME
TO HAVE TO KILL HER.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.784
20 MINUTES.

05:49.827 --> 05:52.395
OH. LOOK.
NOW IT'S 19.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.702
TICK TOCK.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.138
- WE NEED A PLAN.
- ALL RIGHT.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.922
WELL, HERE IS WHAT
WE ARE WORKING WITH.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.837
THEY HAVE A LOT OF GUNS.
WONKRU WON'T LISTEN TO US.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.622
I AM 150 POUNDS WET,

06:01.665 --> 06:03.363
AND YOU CAN'T FIGHT
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.929
INDRA: GUARD THE DOOR.

06:04.973 --> 06:07.410
I'M GONE FOR HALF A DAY,
AND NOW THE PALACE

06:07.454 --> 06:10.326
IS SURROUNDED WITH
ARMED COGs AND CONVICTS?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.980
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
- WE HAVE A SITUATION.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.590
INDRA:
I HEARD THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.026
I'M SURE NELSON
WANTS US PRIMES

06:15.070 --> 06:16.593
TO TELL THE FAITHFUL
WE'RE FULL OF CRAP.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.726
OR HE WANTS
TO KILL YOU.

06:20.771 --> 06:25.036
WHERE'S EVERYONE ELSE?
THEY ASKED FOR RAVEN, TOO.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.432
ALL WE FOUND WERE BODIES
AND BLOOD AT GABRIEL'S CAMP...

06:31.695 --> 06:33.305
NOT OUR PEOPLE.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.003
THERE WAS
NO TRACE OF THEM.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.874
WE LEFT A UNIT IN THE FIELD
TO KEEP SEARCHING.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.833
I WAS AFRAID
TO STAY OUT TOO LONG,

06:38.876 --> 06:40.356
AND I'M AFRAID I'M RIGHT,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.793
CONSIDERING WHAT
I JUST WALKED IN ON.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.447
GAIA IS WITH THEM, TOO,

06:44.491 --> 06:46.275
BUT THEY CAN
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.277
OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN'T.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.931
JACKSON: NATE
WAS WITH THEM.

06:49.974 --> 06:52.194
WE WILL GET NATE
AND GAIA BACK,

06:52.237 --> 06:54.283
BUT WE HAVE 18 MINUTES
TO SAVE EMORI.

06:54.326 --> 06:55.893
HOW? WE CAN'T
GET THEM RAVEN.

06:55.937 --> 06:58.330
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LIKE IT--

06:58.374 --> 06:59.941
HELL, I DON'T
LIKE IT--

06:59.984 --> 07:01.899
BUT WE COULD GIVE THEM
ME AND RUSSELL.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.510
TWO OUT OF 3
AIN'T BAD.

07:03.553 --> 07:06.295
YOU WANT TO LET
SHEIDHEDA GO FREE?

07:06.338 --> 07:08.471
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HE WANTS US TO DO.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.908
- IT IS HARDLY FREE.
- IT'S STILL OUT OF MY CONTROL.

07:10.952 --> 07:13.520
IT'LL AT LEAST
BUY US SOME TIME, OK,

07:13.563 --> 07:15.260
TIME FOR YOU
TO GATHER WONKRU

07:15.304 --> 07:16.740
FOR A FRONTAL
ASSAULT.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.263
I DON'T CARE IF
IT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

07:18.307 --> 07:21.353
I'M GOING IN,
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.443
I WON'T LET
HER DIE, INDRA.

07:23.486 --> 07:27.055
SHEIDHEDA WON'T JUST
VOLUNTEER FOR THIS.

07:27.098 --> 07:30.928
WELL, THEN I GUESS WE'LL
HAVE TO PERSUADE THE BASTARD.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.426
ANDERS TOOK US
OUTSIDE.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.777
WHY THE HELL DID YOU TRY
AND SEND US OUT THERE?

07:55.344 --> 07:58.478
IT'S SURVIVABLE
FOR AN HOUR OR TWO.

07:58.521 --> 08:01.132
I JUST NEEDED TIME TO
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

08:01.176 --> 08:04.005
IF HE WAS TRYING
TO KILL US,

08:04.048 --> 08:07.225
HE WOULD'VE FOUND
EASIER WAYS TO DO IT.

08:07.269 --> 08:11.882
AND NOW YOU'RE OUR TRAINER?
YOU ALWAYS HAVE SO MANY JOBS?

08:11.926 --> 08:14.885
I'M ONLY INVOLVED BECAUSE
OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF--

08:16.408 --> 08:18.454
FROM THE M-CAP,
AND CLEARLY,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.761
THIS ISN'T
A NORMAL SITUATION.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.414
ANDERS HIMSELF WILL
LEAD THE TRAINING,

08:22.458 --> 08:23.677
SOMETHING
HE NEVER DOES.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.243
OH, LUCKY US.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.767
HE USUALLY LETS OTHERS
DOLE OUT THE PUNISHMENT.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.638
OH, WHAT, STAYING AWAKE
FOR 72 HOURS,

08:28.682 --> 08:30.205
SLEEPING IN A MUD PIT,

08:30.248 --> 08:32.599
EATING GRASS
TO STAY ALIVE?

08:32.642 --> 08:34.948
PLEASE.
BEEN THERE. DONE THAT.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.083
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE
TELLING YOU THIS, BUT--

08:41.303 --> 08:43.653
BUT THEY'LL MESS
WITH YOUR MINDS,

08:43.697 --> 08:45.829
TRY AND AMP UP
YOUR EMOTIONS.

08:45.873 --> 08:49.093
IT'S CRUCIAL THAT
YOU KEEP CONTROL.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.056
ANDERS: THESE ARE YOUR
NEW TRAINING PARTNERS.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.841
FOR THE NEXT 12 WEEKS,
YOU WILL EAT, SLEEP,

08:57.885 --> 09:00.191
AND TRAIN WITH THEM
AND WITH NO ONE ELSE.

09:00.235 --> 09:03.586
THOUGH YOU 4 WERE NOT
BORN IN THE CAUSE,

09:03.630 --> 09:05.457
EVERYONE HAS
THE ABILITY WITHIN THEM

09:05.501 --> 09:07.155
TO SERVE HUMANITY.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.852
GIVE EVERYTHING
TO THE GROUP.

09:08.896 --> 09:12.900
TRUST IN THE PROCESS.
TRUST IN EACH OTHER.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.945
FOR ALL MANKIND.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.599
FOR ALL MANKIND.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.427
ANDERS: WE'LL START WITH
SOME SIMPLE SPARRING.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.777
PLEASE CHOOSE A PARTNER.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.612
ANDERS: YOU MAY BEGIN.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.924
MAN: AH!

09:41.450 --> 09:43.670
I WAS TRAINED
BY A LEVEL 12.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.847
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

09:46.890 --> 09:49.110
ORLANDO
TAUGHT YOU WELL.

09:49.153 --> 09:52.592
IT'S NOT SURPRISING.
I WAS HIS MENTOR.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.724
HUH. IT'S A SHAME
HE HAD TO DIE.

09:54.768 --> 09:57.031
IT IS, A LOSS
TO THE CAUSE.

09:57.074 --> 09:59.381
HE WAS ONE
OF OUR BEST,

09:59.424 --> 10:01.601
BUT I BELIEVE
DEV HAD A HAND

10:01.644 --> 10:03.428
IN YOUR TRAINING,
AS WELL.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.652
ANSWER ME, TRAINEE.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.611
WASN'T DEV YOUR
SURROGATE FATHER?

10:11.654 --> 10:13.003
I'M NOT GONNA TALK
ABOUT HIM WITH YOU.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.570
WELL, THEN PERHAPS
YOU'RE NOT READY YET.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.747
ECHO: ARE WE HERE
TO TALK OR FIGHT...

10:17.791 --> 10:20.054
SIR?

10:20.097 --> 10:21.359
HAVE YOU
MADE A NOTE

10:21.403 --> 10:23.187
OF THESE RESPONSES,
MR. LEVITT?

10:23.231 --> 10:25.450
- YES, SIR.
- HMM.

10:25.494 --> 10:29.454
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU, SIR?
THEY'VE GIVEN ME AN IDEA.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.587
OF COURSE.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.851
OCTAVIA AND ZORA,
SLOWER.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.335
WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT, SIR,

10:40.378 --> 10:42.250
I'VE SEEN OCTAVIA
KILL MORE PEOPLE

10:42.293 --> 10:44.034
THAN I'VE KNOWN
IN MY LIFE,

10:44.078 --> 10:46.515
AND DIYOZA AND ECHO WERE
TRAINED AS ELITE WARRIORS.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.691
ANDERS: WHICH IS WHY
WE CAN SHAPE THEM.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.911
THEY'LL BE INVALUABLE
IN THE LAST WAR.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.000
YES, BUT WE MAY
NOT HAVE MUCH TIME.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.784
CLARKE GRIFFIN WILL
ARRIVE SOON WITH THE KEY,

10:54.828 --> 10:56.264
AND THE LAST WAR
WILL START.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.527
MAYBE
THE FASTEST WAY IN

10:58.570 --> 11:00.877
IS TO SHOW THEM WHAT
WE'RE REALLY ABOUT...

11:00.921 --> 11:02.705
- UH!
- UH!

11:03.706 --> 11:06.013
OUR WAY OF LIFE.

11:06.056 --> 11:08.145
ANDERS: I'LL TAKE IT
UNDER ADVISEMENT,

11:08.189 --> 11:11.018
BUT FIRST, WE NEED TO
BREAK THEM OF THEIR BONDS,

11:11.061 --> 11:12.802
OR THEY'LL KEEP CHOOSING
TO FIGHT FOR EACH OTHER

11:12.846 --> 11:15.631
INSTEAD OF
ALL MANKIND.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.285
THEY NEED TO HAVE
FAITH IN THE CAUSE

11:17.328 --> 11:20.723
ABOVE ALL.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.117
THEN WE CAN BRING THEM
INTO THE COMMUNITY.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.945
BEGIN THE FEAR
SIMULATION.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.869
HOPE?

11:35.912 --> 11:37.566
OH!

11:53.147 --> 11:57.717
IF YOU TOUCH HER,
I WILL KILL YOU.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.636
WAIT. NO. DON'T!

12:17.301 --> 12:19.956
LET ME SEE HER.

12:25.353 --> 12:28.748
SHE'S NOT YOUR BABY.
SHE'S ALL OF OURS.

12:30.358 --> 12:33.796
SHE BELONGS
TO THE CAUSE.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.493
SHE'S MINE.

12:35.537 --> 12:39.062
SHE'LL BE CARED FOR,
FED, BATHED,

12:39.106 --> 12:43.240
COMFORTED,
AND WATCHED OVER...

12:43.284 --> 12:45.155
NO.

12:45.199 --> 12:48.898
NOT BY TWO EYES,
BUT BY THOUSANDS.

12:51.118 --> 12:54.469
NO. NO!

13:02.694 --> 13:04.696
BRING HER OUT.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.353
NO!

13:11.660 --> 13:13.140
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

13:13.183 --> 13:16.317
A TEST,
AND YOU FAILED,

13:16.360 --> 13:19.189
LIKE OCTAVIA AND
HOPE BEFORE YOU.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.844
YOU NEED TO GIVE UP
ON YOUR SELFISH LOVE,

13:21.888 --> 13:24.064
YOUR MOTHERLY
INSTINCTS.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.543
I CAN'T JUST
TURN IT OFF

13:25.587 --> 13:27.328
LIKE A ROBOT.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.112
THEN YOU'D
BETTER LEARN

13:29.156 --> 13:31.985
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
COME OVER TO THE CAUSE,

13:32.028 --> 13:34.465
YOU'LL BE SENT
BACK TO PENANCE

13:34.509 --> 13:39.949
ONE AT A TIME TO
GROW OLD AND DIE ALONE,

13:39.993 --> 13:43.344
SO...

13:43.387 --> 13:47.000
I SUGGEST YOU COMMIT
TO THE TRAINING,

13:47.043 --> 13:49.611
OR YOU'LL LOSE
YOUR SANITY

13:49.654 --> 13:51.395
AND YOUR LIFE.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.971
SO THEY TOOK
30 PEOPLE HOSTAGE?

14:02.015 --> 14:06.193
YOU REALLY DO HAVE AN
IRON GRIP ON THIS PLACE.

14:06.236 --> 14:09.979
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR GAMES.
DON'T ACT SO SURPRISED.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.938
YOU WANTED CHAOS,
AND YOU GOT IT.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.678
IN THE MEANTIME,
MY PEOPLE WILL BLOW

14:13.722 --> 14:16.246
THE DOORS OFF THE PLACE
AND COME IN SHOOTING.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.553
WHY DON'T YOU
GO PLAY HERO?

14:18.596 --> 14:20.903
OH, I'M GOING.
SO ARE YOU.

14:20.947 --> 14:24.602
WHY WOULD I, HMM?

14:24.646 --> 14:26.517
AS WE DISCUSSED
BEFORE,

14:26.561 --> 14:28.519
IF THESE FOOLS
FINALLY WISE UP,

14:28.563 --> 14:30.913
THEN THEY'LL WANT
TO TEAR ME APART,

14:30.957 --> 14:32.915
AND IF
I SURVIVE THAT,

14:32.959 --> 14:35.831
THEN YOU HAVE NO REASON
TO KEEP ME AROUND.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.920
IT'S A QUICK DEATH
EITHER WAY.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.661
HOW ABOUT A SLOW ONE
RIGHT NOW?

14:39.704 --> 14:42.229
AS MUCH AS
I'D RELISH THAT,

14:42.272 --> 14:44.971
I'M GOING
TO NEED MORE.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.757
I'LL PROTECT YOU
FROM THE FAITHFUL.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.801
THAT'S A START.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.934
OH, COME ON.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.894
YOU CAN HAVE BACK
YOUR 10 MINUTES A DAY

14:54.937 --> 14:57.200
OF GUARDED TIME OUTSIDE.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.898
- 30 MINUTES...
- 20!

14:58.941 --> 15:01.813
AND I WANT SOMEONE
TO PLAY CHESS WITH,

15:01.857 --> 15:04.991
SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS
THE COMPLEXITIES.

15:05.034 --> 15:08.559
TRUST ME, I'M DONE
PLAYING WITH YOU.

15:08.603 --> 15:11.301
PERHAPS YOU'RE A MORE
FORMIDABLE OPPONENT.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.304
I DON'T PLAY GAMES.

15:14.348 --> 15:18.656
I'LL FIND YOU SOMEONE.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

15:18.700 --> 15:22.269
MM...YES,
BUT SINCE YOUR PLAN

15:22.312 --> 15:25.272
MOST LIKELY
LEAVES US DEAD,

15:25.315 --> 15:27.578
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

15:27.622 --> 15:30.190
WHILE I WAS PRETENDING
TO BE THAT SIMPERING FOOL,

15:30.233 --> 15:32.932
I HAPPENED UPON SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT HELP US.

15:36.109 --> 15:39.068
A TUNNEL
UNDER THE PALACE.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.810
IT LEADS RIGHT
INTO THE GREAT HALL.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.812
THIS COULD WORK.

15:43.855 --> 15:46.336
ALYSSA CAN
SHOW YOU THE WAY.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.254
I FEEL LIKE THIS
IS THE BEGINNING

15:51.298 --> 15:54.083
OF A BEAUTIFUL
FRIENDSHIP.

16:02.178 --> 16:06.530
NO MORNING SICKNESS.
SIGN ME UP.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.011
NO NEGATIVE EFFECTS
ON A WOMAN'S HEALTH

16:09.055 --> 16:12.754
IN ANY WAY, AND WE
CAN MONITOR THE EMBRYOS

16:12.797 --> 16:15.452
AND THE EXTRACORPOREAL
GESTATIONAL SYSTEMS

16:15.496 --> 16:17.498
FOR BIRTH DEFECTS
AND CORRECT THEM

16:17.541 --> 16:21.371
BEFORE
THEY ARE BORN.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.591
PLEASE.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.248
SHE HAD
A HEART DEFECT?

16:28.291 --> 16:29.945
YES.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.600
BUT IT WAS SURGICALLY
CORRECTED 3 WEEKS AGO.

16:32.643 --> 16:35.037
NOW SHE'S PERFECT

16:35.081 --> 16:37.909
AND ABOUT READY
TO BE BIRTHED.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.566
Let's give her
some privacy.

16:42.610 --> 16:43.959
Agreed.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.006
I KNOW IT MUST
SEEM STRANGE,

16:47.049 --> 16:49.660
BUT THE FACT THAT YOU GESTATED
IN YOUR MOTHER'S BODY

16:49.704 --> 16:53.534
IS EQUALLY AS BIZARRE
TO US.

16:53.577 --> 16:56.058
YOU DID KICK THE HELL
OUT OF MY KIDNEYS.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.234
EXACTLY.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.106
IN OUR METHOD,
NONE OF OUR PEOPLE

17:00.149 --> 17:02.891
ARE LAID UP FOR EXTENDED
PERIODS OF TIME.

17:02.934 --> 17:06.502
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW MANY EMBRYOS WE HAVE?

17:06.547 --> 17:11.595
25, THE SAME NUMBER OF DISCIPLES
THAT YOU HAVE MURDERED.

17:12.901 --> 17:16.165
OCTAVIA: IF YOU NEED
AS MANY WARRIORS AS POSSIBLE,

17:16.209 --> 17:18.166
THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST
HATCH A LARGER ARMY?

17:18.211 --> 17:20.865
RESOURCES.
IT'S A LIMITED WORLD.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.563
AND YOU CAN ONLY
MIND-CONTROL

17:22.606 --> 17:24.086
SO MANY
AT A TIME, SO--

17:24.130 --> 17:26.871
AND THESE KIDS,
THEY DON'T HAVE

17:26.915 --> 17:28.525
ANY PARENTS
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM

17:28.569 --> 17:31.572
AFTER THEY'RE...
DEGLOPPED.

17:31.615 --> 17:34.314
ANDERS: THE TEAM
RAISE THE CHILDREN

17:34.357 --> 17:36.316
UNTIL THEY'RE READY
FOR THE CRECHE,

17:36.359 --> 17:38.274
AND THEN
IT'S EVERYONE'S JOB.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.189
SO THEY DON'T FORM
SELFISH BONDS.

17:40.233 --> 17:43.105
EXACTLY.
YOU'RE LEARNING.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.155
I UNDERSTAND YOU
HAVE LEARNED A LOT

17:49.198 --> 17:51.896
ABOUT THE SHEPHERD'S
JOURNEY.

17:51.940 --> 17:56.205
WHO CAN TELL ME
ABOUT ETHEREA? HMM.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.120
THE MOUNTAIN
WAS VERY TALL

17:58.164 --> 18:00.209
AND VERY SCARY,
BUT THE SHEPHERD

18:00.253 --> 18:02.081
WAS BRAVE
AND WISE.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.908
ANDERS: EXCELLENT.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.519
WHO ELSE CAN
TELL ME SOMETHING

18:05.562 --> 18:07.695
ABOUT THE SHEPHERD'S
JOURNEY TO ENLIGHTENMENT?

18:07.738 --> 18:09.958
WHAT PASSAGE DO WE HAVE
IN OUR BOOKS ABOUT IT?

18:12.613 --> 18:16.356
- SEAN.
- I--I DON'T KNOW.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.229
SOMETIMES WHEN
NEW THINGS HAPPEN,

18:20.273 --> 18:21.752
WE GET NERVOUS.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.320
WE HAVE FEELINGS WE NEED
TO LEARN TO CONTROL.

18:24.364 --> 18:27.062
- OTHERWISE--
- THEY CONTROL US.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.153
BUT WHEN WE FEEL
OUT OF CONTROL,

18:31.197 --> 18:33.068
WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.983
PERHAPS WE'LL HAVE
THE HONOR OF MR. ANDERS

18:35.026 --> 18:36.767
LEADING US
IN OUR EXERCISE.

18:36.811 --> 18:41.250
MY PLEASURE. OK.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.609
EVERYONE.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.831
NOW...

18:56.874 --> 18:58.049
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

18:59.616 --> 19:02.184
ANDERS: HOLD IT
AND LET IT OUT SLOWLY

19:02.228 --> 19:04.882
ON A COUNT OF 3.

19:07.581 --> 19:12.890
THE SHEPHERD BRINGS US CALM.
THE SHEPHERD BRINGS US WISDOM.

19:12.934 --> 19:17.460
THE SHEPHERD BRINGS US
LOVE FOR ALL MANKIND.

19:17.504 --> 19:20.637
NOW...

19:21.595 --> 19:24.989
ANDERS: OPEN YOUR EYES
AND BREATHE.

19:26.817 --> 19:30.299
EXCELLENT. MISS HAGGERMAN,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.388
CONTINUE
WORKING HARD...

19:32.432 --> 19:34.956
ANDER AND CHILDREN:
FOR ALL MANKIND.

19:34.999 --> 19:39.178
OH, THIS IS SOME
SERIOUS BRAINWASHING.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.835
THESE KIDS HAD IT
BETTER THAN I EVER DID.

19:44.879 --> 19:48.970
HAGGERMAN: OK, CLASS.
OPEN TO PAGE 273 OF THE BOOK.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.407
WHO WOULD LIKE TO READ
THE FIRST PASSAGE?

19:55.237 --> 19:58.414
ECHO: THEY ARE WATCHING
US ALL OF THE TIME.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.329
YOU'VE GOT
TO TRY HARDER.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.201
DIYOZA: SHE'S RIGHT.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.115
ECHO'S THE ONLY ONE THAT PASSED
THE FEAR SIMULATION,

20:04.159 --> 20:06.248
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO ALMOST KILLED ANDERS.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.815
YEAH.
WISH IT WAS REAL.

20:07.858 --> 20:12.863
STOP. GET YOUR ANGER
UNDER CONTROL,

20:12.907 --> 20:15.083
OR DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO PENANCE ALONE?

20:15.126 --> 20:18.086
WHAT DO THEY WANT
WITH US, ANYWAY?

20:18.129 --> 20:20.741
WE CAN ALREADY KICK
THE DISCIPLES' ASSES.

20:20.784 --> 20:23.570
- NOT THE POINT.
- SINGLE-MINDED DEVOTION.

20:23.613 --> 20:26.007
SCREW YOUR FRIENDS,
FAMILY.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.401
YOU'VE GOT
TO BURY YOUR LOVE

20:28.444 --> 20:30.881
AND YOUR ANGER
AND EVERYTHING ELSE

20:30.925 --> 20:33.449
SO DEEP THEY'LL
NEVER FIND IT.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.669
- IT'S NOT THAT HARD.
- YEAH, FOR YOU.

20:35.712 --> 20:38.019
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST
LIKE HAVING SOMEONE

20:38.062 --> 20:39.412
GIVE YOU ORDERS
AGAIN SO YOU DON'T

20:39.455 --> 20:41.457
HAVE TO THINK
FOR YOURSELF.

20:46.593 --> 20:49.509
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO GO TO BED.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.561
DAMN YOURSELF
IF YOU WANT TO,

20:58.605 --> 21:00.737
BUT I BELIEVE IN WHAT
THEY'RE TEACHING,

21:00.781 --> 21:03.262
AND I WILL NOT LET YOU
TAKE ME DOWN WITH YOU.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.324
THEY'RE LIKE TRAINERS
FOR THE SUITS.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.457
THEY WORK WITH
MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.851
NOT AS COOL AS SWORDS,
BUT STILL PRETTY EFFECTIVE.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.377
WE GET TO PLAY
WITH THOSE?

21:31.420 --> 21:34.336
YOU'LL BE CROSS-TRAINED
ON ALL OF THEM EVENTUALLY.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.382
- WHAT IS THIS?
- THAT'S A FLAMETHROWER.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.993
IT'LL MAKE YOU
SMOKY AND CRISPY.

21:39.036 --> 21:41.604
LEVITT: WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'LL BE FIGHTING.

21:41.648 --> 21:44.215
WE HAVE TO BE
PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.046
WHAT'S IN HERE?

21:49.090 --> 21:51.310
LEVITT: ONLY LEVEL 11s
AND ABOVE ALLOWED.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.659
BIOWEAPONS?

21:52.702 --> 21:54.356
LEVITT: NOT A WEAPON,

21:54.400 --> 21:56.184
AT LEAST NOT ANYTHING
THAT WE WOULD EVER USE.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.839
IF WE'RE GONNA
GO ALL IN,

21:58.882 --> 22:01.363
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRUST US.

22:01.407 --> 22:05.802
AFTER YEARS OF STUDY,
WE'VE MANAGED TO ISOLATE

22:05.846 --> 22:07.369
THE SUBSTANCE
THAT WIPED OUT

22:07.413 --> 22:09.284
THE FORMER INHABITANTS
OF THIS PLANET.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.460
THOSE CRYSTAL CREATURES
THAT WE SAW OUTSIDE?

22:11.504 --> 22:14.637
YES.
WE CALL IT GEM9,

22:14.681 --> 22:16.509
AND THE LITTLE
THAT WE HAVE

22:16.552 --> 22:18.728
WOULD WIPE OUT
EVERYONE ON BARDO.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.386
LEVITT: NOW IT'S TIME TO TRAIN.

22:25.909 --> 22:28.390
ANDERS: THIS EXERCISE
IS ABOUT COMMUNICATION

22:28.434 --> 22:29.870
AND TEAMWORK.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.350
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.221
THE SHOOTER WILL
BE FIRING BLINDLY.

22:33.264 --> 22:34.831
THEY'LL HAVE TO LISTEN
TO THEIR SPOTTER

22:34.875 --> 22:36.746
TO HIT THE SMALL
TARGET BEHIND ME.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.227
FIRST PERSON
WHO HITS IT WINS.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.185
PLEASE...

22:41.229 --> 22:43.927
HELP YOUR PARTNER
WITH THE BLINDFOLDS.

22:43.971 --> 22:46.800
ARE THESE WEAPONS LETHAL?

22:48.454 --> 22:49.585
NO.

22:51.195 --> 22:53.284
ANDERS: IS EVERYONE READY?

22:55.722 --> 22:58.333
BEGIN.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.204
TARGET'S DEAD AHEAD,
SHOULDER HEIGHT.

23:00.248 --> 23:02.337
DOWN,
TO THE LEFT.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.295
WOMAN: SHOOT
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.863
MAN: A LITTLE BIT DOWN,
TO THE RIGHT.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.648
- UH!
- OH!

23:08.691 --> 23:12.347
- UH!
- HUH!

23:16.830 --> 23:20.616
UH, 3--
3 INCHES DOWN.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.313
HIT.

23:25.012 --> 23:27.275
JEEZ. YOU OK?

23:27.318 --> 23:28.363
YEAH.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.153
WHAT THE HELL?

23:38.765 --> 23:40.375
I WON.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.769
TECHNICALLY, BUT YOU BROKE
THE SPIRIT OF THE RULES.

23:42.812 --> 23:47.338
FOLLOWING RULES ISN'T
HOW YOU WIN A WAR.

23:47.382 --> 23:51.473
PERFECT CONTROL.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.520
THAT IS HOW WE WIN.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.836
- HEY.
- WHAT'S UP?

24:06.880 --> 24:09.143
I JUST WANTED
TO CHECK IN.

24:09.186 --> 24:10.666
I KNOW
IT'S BEEN ROUGH,

24:10.710 --> 24:12.842
LOTS OF NEW THINGS.

24:12.886 --> 24:16.063
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.371
I'VE HAD WORSE.

24:20.415 --> 24:23.505
OH, I KNOW.

24:23.549 --> 24:28.771
YEAH. YOU'VE SEEN ME
AT MY WORST.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.513
AND BEST.

24:31.557 --> 24:34.473
JUST KEEP IT UP.
IT'S ALMOST OVER.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.433
YOU WOULDN'T COME HERE
JUST TO TELL ME THAT.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.001
THIS LAST PART,

24:41.044 --> 24:44.004
YOU HAVE
TO PASS IT, OR--

24:44.047 --> 24:46.702
OR WE'RE SENT TO PENANCE,
LEFT TO DIE ONE BY ONE.

24:50.314 --> 24:53.143
DO YOU THINK
WE'LL FAIL?

24:53.187 --> 24:56.669
NO. YOU'VE
COME SO FAR.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.497
YOU'VE WORKED HARD

24:58.540 --> 25:00.673
AND SEEM TO UNDERSTAND
OUR WAY OF LIFE,

25:00.716 --> 25:02.283
BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO BE BETTER

25:02.326 --> 25:03.893
AT KEEPING YOUR
EMOTIONS UNDER CONTROL.

25:03.937 --> 25:07.723
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE
AT BEST A LEVEL TWO.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.595
ONLY A TWO?

25:11.205 --> 25:13.903
I THINK I'M
BETTER THAN THAT.

25:13.947 --> 25:16.036
WHAT LEVEL ARE YOU?

25:17.690 --> 25:19.343
11.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.171
WELL, LEVEL 11...

25:24.827 --> 25:28.178
DO YOU FEEL
ANYTHING?

25:28.222 --> 25:30.224
NO.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.795
How about now? Heh.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.233
DEFINITELY...

25:42.584 --> 25:44.455
NOTHING.

25:46.109 --> 25:49.373
YEAH.
ME, EITHER.

26:20.448 --> 26:23.059
WOMAN:
NIKKI, INCOMING.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.366
SAVED BY THE BELL.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.849
4 MINUTES TO SPARE.
WHERE'S RAVEN?

26:29.892 --> 26:31.807
SHE TOOK A GROUP
TO THE SECOND COMPOUND SITE.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.417
THEY'RE EXPECTED BACK
ANYTIME.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.768
DON'T SPIT IN MY FACE
AND TELL ME IT'S RAINING.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.334
HEY, LOOK.
I GET IT.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.119
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED
TO MY GIRL,

26:39.162 --> 26:40.599
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO,

26:40.642 --> 26:43.993
BUT I SWEAR TO YOU,
SHE IS COMING.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.388
SINCE RUSSELL AND I ARE HERE,
YOU DON'T NEED THE KIDS ANYMORE.

26:47.431 --> 26:50.173
- LET THEM GO.
- NOW IT'S 3 MINUTES.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.088
JUST ENOUGH TIME
TO END THIS CHARADE.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.961
NOW TELL THESE PEOPLE
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.485
EMORI: UH...UH.

26:57.528 --> 27:02.708
- WHERE IS SHE?
- HMM.

27:02.751 --> 27:06.059
HOPE YOU HAVE
LOTS TO SAY.

27:06.102 --> 27:09.758
- YOU'RE FIRST.
- UH!

27:15.764 --> 27:18.419
I'M NOT DANIEL LEE.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.160
- HUH? WHAT?
- WHAT?

27:20.203 --> 27:22.031
MY NAME
IS JOHN MURPHY.

27:23.685 --> 27:26.906
MURPHY: ZEV WAS RIGHT.
WE ARE NOT PRIMES.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.429
JEREMIAH: NO.

27:28.472 --> 27:31.258
YOU SAVED MY SON
WITH YOUR GRACE.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.699
- YOUR TURN.
- UH!

27:37.743 --> 27:39.745
Stall.
Indra's coming.

27:39.788 --> 27:42.312
OK.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.532
IT'S TRUE.

27:44.575 --> 27:47.970
MY NAME IS EMORI,

27:48.014 --> 27:51.104
AND THIS IS THE BODY
I WAS BORN WITH.

27:53.715 --> 27:56.457
- THE LEES ARE DEAD.
- NO. IT'S NOT TRUE.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.807
THEY'RE ONLY SAYING WHAT
OUR ENEMIES WANT TO HEAR.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.288
HAVE FAITH. FAITH!

28:01.331 --> 28:03.290
- UH!
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.335
ONE MINUTE TILL
I START SHOOTING

28:05.379 --> 28:08.817
UNLESS RAVEN SHOWS UP TO
TAKE THE BULLETS FOR YOU.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.558
EMORI: OH! UH!

28:17.391 --> 28:21.612
RUSSELL HAD ALL YOU FOOLS
CONVINCED HE WAS A GOD.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.573
WHERE'S INDRA?

28:25.616 --> 28:28.097
RUSSHEDA: IF THAT GUY REALLY WAS
A GOD, WHY WAS IT SO EASY FOR ME

28:28.141 --> 28:31.492
TO KILL HIM
AND TAKE HIS BODY?

28:31.535 --> 28:33.102
ZEV: WHAT?
NO. NO. NO.

28:33.146 --> 28:37.759
I AM NOT
RUSSELL LIGHTBOURNE.

28:37.803 --> 28:41.720
I WEAR HIS BODY
AS MY HOST.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.809
- NO.
- THIS CANNOT BE TRUE.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.900
RUSSHEDA: YOUR PRIMES
ARE GONE FOREVER.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.815
ZEV: NO. YOU WILL DIE
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.556
WOMAN: IT'S NOT TRUE.
THEY'RE LYING TO SAVE US ALL.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.428
- RRGH! UH!
- TIME'S UP.

28:54.471 --> 28:56.691
LOOKS LIKE EMORI DIES
INSTEAD OF RAVEN.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.650
WAIT. OK. IT WASN'T RAVEN'S IDEA
TO USE YOUR PEOPLE, OK?

28:59.694 --> 29:03.698
IT WAS MINE.
IT WAS MINE.

29:05.221 --> 29:08.747
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

29:11.227 --> 29:13.752
HEROING'S NOT
REALLY MY THING...

29:14.796 --> 29:16.537
BUT HATCH, HE WAS
A BETTER MAN THAN ME.

29:16.580 --> 29:17.973
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

29:18.017 --> 29:20.541
TAKE HIS NAME
OUT OF YOUR LYING MOUTH.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.587
HE WAS A
TRUE-BLUE HERO.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.810
HE SAVED
ALL OF US, NIKKI,

29:28.854 --> 29:30.246
SO THINK ABOUT IT.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.031
IF YOU KILL
THESE PEOPLE,

29:32.074 --> 29:34.294
IT'S SORT OF LIKE SPITTING
ALL OVER HIS GOOD WORK.

29:35.251 --> 29:37.427
- AAH!
- UH!

29:38.385 --> 29:40.039
UH!

29:40.082 --> 29:42.650
- GET DOWN. DROP YOUR GUN.
- WEAPONS DOWN NOW.

29:42.693 --> 29:45.000
PENN: DROP IT.

29:45.044 --> 29:49.439
PUT THE GUN DOWN,
ALL OF YOU.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.095
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.

29:55.010 --> 29:58.405
PENN: NIKKI, IT'S OVER.
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

29:58.448 --> 30:01.234
DIFFERENT MAN:
PUT IT DOWN.

30:01.277 --> 30:04.454
INDRA: EVERYONE,
ON YOUR KNEES.

30:05.412 --> 30:07.283
MMPH.

30:10.373 --> 30:14.203
RUSSHEDA: YOU'RE WELCOME.
THE PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY.

30:14.247 --> 30:16.858
SO FAR.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.127
HOPE: HEY.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.868
ECHO, HEY,
WE NEED TO GO.

30:26.912 --> 30:30.219
- GO WHERE?
- I HAVE A PLAN.

30:30.263 --> 30:32.004
PLAN FOR WHAT?

30:32.047 --> 30:34.180
REVENGE, BUT
WE NEED TO GO

30:34.223 --> 30:37.531
BEFORE THEY DISCOVER
WHAT I TOOK.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.708
YOU TOOK
THE FLAMETHROWER?

30:40.751 --> 30:43.929
WE NEED TO TORCH
THE OXYGEN FARM.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.368
WHAT?

30:48.411 --> 30:49.673
I ALREADY SHUT DOWN THE
FIRE-SUPPRESSION SYSTEM.

30:49.717 --> 30:52.067
IT'LL BE AN INFERNO.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.504
WE'LL END BARDO
TODAY.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.728
HOPE...

31:02.991 --> 31:04.514
WAIT.

31:04.558 --> 31:06.777
HOPE!

31:09.171 --> 31:12.000
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER
AND OCTAVIA?

31:12.044 --> 31:13.828
LEVEL TWO.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.830
THE ALARMS WILL
CREATE CHAOS.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.353
WE'LL HAVE TIME
TO GET TO THEM,

31:17.397 --> 31:18.964
AND THROUGH THE
CONFUSION, WE'LL GET

31:19.007 --> 31:20.661
TO THE STONE ROOM AND
GET OFF THIS PLANET.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.663
I DON'T THINK YOU
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.621
I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED THIS.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.928
THEY TOOK
BELLAMY FROM YOU.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.235
THEY STOLE MY LIFE.

31:29.278 --> 31:32.629
YES, BUT THIS
ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.718
LET'S GO GET YOUR MOM
AND OCTAVIA,

31:34.762 --> 31:36.068
RUN THIS PLAN
BY THEM.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.286
DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?

31:37.330 --> 31:39.549
THEY'LL TRY
AND STOP US.

31:39.593 --> 31:41.290
THEY'VE BOUGHT IN.

31:43.379 --> 31:46.208
WE HAVE TO SAVE THEM
FROM THEMSELVES.

31:47.209 --> 31:48.254
HOPE!

31:53.346 --> 31:55.478
HOPE, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.958
TALK?

31:57.002 --> 31:58.438
THAT IS NOT THE ECHO
THAT I SPENT

31:58.481 --> 32:00.744
5 YEARS WITH
ON SKYRING.

32:00.788 --> 32:03.356
I GUESS THEY
GOT TO YOU, TOO.

32:03.399 --> 32:06.141
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

32:06.185 --> 32:09.884
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT BELLAMY
MEANT SOMETHING TO YOU.

32:18.197 --> 32:21.156
CAN'T LET YOU
KILL EVERYB--

32:21.200 --> 32:23.942
HOPE, STOP!

32:24.943 --> 32:26.553
- UH!
- AGH!

32:26.596 --> 32:28.729
OH...OH...

32:28.772 --> 32:29.817
UHH...

32:32.298 --> 32:35.736
I HAVE TO SAVE YOU
FROM YOURSELF, ALL OF YOU.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.825
- SORRY.
- AGH!

32:37.868 --> 32:40.349
UH...UH...

32:40.393 --> 32:41.872
HUH...

32:51.056 --> 32:54.015
- I KILLED HER.
- YES.

32:55.582 --> 32:57.932
YOU SAVED EVERYONE
ELSE IN BARDO.

32:57.976 --> 33:01.283
YOU PASSED
THE FINAL TEST.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.770
DIYOZA: HOPE...

33:09.813 --> 33:11.902
COME ON. HURRY UP.

33:11.946 --> 33:14.644
WE TORCH THE OXYGEN FARM,
WE CAN END THESE JACKALS.

33:14.688 --> 33:16.777
WELL, ARE YOU SURE?

33:16.820 --> 33:20.824
- WON'T THIS KILL EVERYONE HERE?
- YEAH.

33:22.739 --> 33:23.784
SO?

33:28.919 --> 33:31.879
OH, BUT WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT OUR PEOPLE?

33:31.922 --> 33:33.272
- UH!
- UH!

33:40.105 --> 33:41.889
UH!

33:43.934 --> 33:45.588
YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL
YOUR OWN MOTHER

33:45.632 --> 33:46.937
TO SAVE WHO, EXACTLY?

33:46.981 --> 33:50.811
OCTAVIA, ECHO,
AND GABRIEL.

33:50.854 --> 33:53.727
WAITING FOR US
IN THE STONE ROOM.

33:53.770 --> 33:57.296
YOU DONE?
CAN WE DO THIS?

34:03.041 --> 34:05.130
DO IT.

34:05.173 --> 34:07.045
THEY DESERVE IT FOR
WHAT THEY DID TO US.

34:17.054 --> 34:20.667
I'M SORRY, HOPE.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.364
YOU FAILED.

34:25.672 --> 34:28.196
DIYOZA: I WON'T LET YOU DO THIS.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.110
HUH!

34:30.155 --> 34:32.331
UH! AGH...

34:32.373 --> 34:33.505
WHY? UHH...

34:45.518 --> 34:47.650
YOUR FIGHT IS OVER.

34:59.271 --> 35:01.360
ANDERS: YOU SHOULD ALL BE PROUD.

35:01.403 --> 35:06.234
EACH OF YOU HAS SHOWN
COMMITMENT TO THE CAUSE.

35:06.278 --> 35:09.281
I'M SURE YOU WILL SERVE WELL
IN THE LAST WAR,

35:09.324 --> 35:11.935
BUT SADLY, ONE OF YOU

35:11.979 --> 35:15.852
HAS NOT BEEN ABLE
TO GROW FOR THE CAUSE.

35:15.896 --> 35:18.290
THE SHEPHERD
IS MERCIFUL.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.900
WE DON'T
EXPECT PERFECT

35:19.943 --> 35:22.250
EMOTIONAL CONTROL
SO SOON,

35:22.294 --> 35:25.558
CERTAINLY NOT
FROM LEVEL TWOS.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.735
ECHO...

35:32.913 --> 35:35.263
YOU HAVE BEEN
OUR STAR STUDENT.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.309
YOU FULLY INTEGRATED
INTO OUR CULTURE,

35:37.352 --> 35:39.615
SO I'M GIVING YOU
THE HONOR

35:39.659 --> 35:41.661
OF DECIDING
HOPE'S FATE.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.148
WE HAVE TO BREAK
HER SPIRIT,

35:50.191 --> 35:52.846
RIP APART HER BONDS.

35:55.675 --> 35:59.722
5 YEARS ON PENANCE.

36:01.071 --> 36:03.291
ANDERS: A FAIR
SENTENCE. GUARDS.

36:03.335 --> 36:07.077
NO. OH, NO. NO. NO.
ECHO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:07.121 --> 36:09.384
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:09.428 --> 36:14.781
MOM, PLEASE!
NO! PLEASE! STOP!

36:14.824 --> 36:17.087
ANDERS: HER PENANCE
BEGINS SOON.

36:17.131 --> 36:20.743
YOUR CELEBRATION
BEGINS NOW.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.789
FOR ALL MANKIND.

36:22.832 --> 36:25.618
ALL: FOR ALL MANKIND.

36:47.248 --> 36:48.771
DID NELSON GIVE YOU
ANY TROUBLE?

36:48.815 --> 36:50.251
NO. HE'S SECURE.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.035
GOOD. NOW POSITION
YOUR MEN OUTSIDE THE DOOR

36:52.079 --> 36:55.300
OF THIS HALL AND
AWAIT MY ORDERS.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.916
MAN: HE'S A LIAR.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.613
ALYSSA: WHY ARE THEY
ALL TELLING LIES

37:04.657 --> 37:06.485
ABOUT YOU,
YOUR GRACE?

37:06.528 --> 37:09.966
THEY DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH
OF YOUR FAITH, ALYSSA.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.186
THANK YOU FOR
LEADING INDRA HERE.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.797
YOU SERVED ME
WELL.

37:14.841 --> 37:18.105
ANYTHING FOR YOU,
YOUR GRACE.

37:18.148 --> 37:20.890
ZEV: I WAS RIGHT. I TOLD YOU.
THEY ARE NOT OUR PRIMES.

37:20.934 --> 37:25.286
THEY ARE LIARS
AND MANIPULATORS.

37:25.330 --> 37:28.071
HOW DARE YOU
SAY THAT, ZEV?

37:28.115 --> 37:31.684
ZEV: THEY PREYED ON OUR FAITH,
AND THEY SHOULD PAY FOR THAT.

37:31.727 --> 37:35.340
WOMAN:
HE DESERVES TO DIE.

37:35.383 --> 37:37.167
THEY'RE
GETTING ROWDY.

37:37.211 --> 37:38.691
WE SHOULD GET THEM
OUT OF HERE.

37:38.734 --> 37:42.869
I GOT IT HANDLED.
YOU SHOULD GO.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.741
- KILL THEM.
- MURDERER!

37:54.097 --> 37:57.449
MAN: THEY LIED TO US.

37:57.492 --> 37:59.755
- THEY'LL PAY FOR IT.
- WATCH IT.

38:02.410 --> 38:05.805
MAN: THEY TOOK OUR FAITH,
TOOK EVERYTHING!

38:05.848 --> 38:09.983
- KILL THEM.
- TAKE THEM AWAY.

38:10.026 --> 38:11.898
ALYSSA:
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

38:11.941 --> 38:14.074
WOMAN: YOU SHOULD PAY
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

38:20.646 --> 38:23.039
DO NOT OPEN
THESE DOORS.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.867
YOU MIGHT HEAR
DISTURBING THINGS,

38:24.911 --> 38:26.826
BUT THESE
ARE MY ORDERS.

38:26.869 --> 38:29.829
IS THAT CLEAR?

38:29.872 --> 38:32.222
- HE LIED TO US.
- ZEV, STOP.

38:32.266 --> 38:33.659
- GOD SLAYER!
- ZEV, NO. STOP.

38:33.702 --> 38:37.358
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- SHUT UP, FOOL.

38:40.187 --> 38:42.058
AHH...

38:43.451 --> 38:46.454
AHH...

38:46.498 --> 38:48.935
THERE IS AN ANCIENT SAYING--

38:50.328 --> 38:54.506
WHAT IS A KING
WITHOUT SUBJECTS?

38:54.549 --> 38:57.465
BUT I ASK,

38:57.509 --> 39:02.514
WHAT ARE SUBJECTS
WITHOUT A KING?

39:02.557 --> 39:06.300
THEY ARE BUT LOST SHEEP--

39:06.344 --> 39:10.478
CONFUSED AND SCARED...

39:12.654 --> 39:15.570
NEEDING GUIDANCE

39:15.614 --> 39:18.660
AND PROTECTION

39:18.704 --> 39:22.098
FROM THE WOLF

39:22.142 --> 39:26.059
WHO DELIGHTS
IN THEIR SLAUGHTER.

39:29.976 --> 39:32.935
ZEV: STOP.
STOP HIM! ATTACK!

39:32.979 --> 39:35.329
MURPHY: INDRA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.896
KILLING A DEMON.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.288
DO YOU HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH THAT?

39:42.292 --> 39:45.034
GOOD.
GET SOME REST.

39:45.078 --> 39:47.297
YOU'VE BOTH HAD
A LONG DAY.

39:52.259 --> 39:56.524
WE SHOULD GO BEFORE
THEY COME FOR US.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.442
WHAT?

40:01.486 --> 40:03.444
THIS IS WHAT HE WANTED.
OPEN THE DOOR.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.359
ONLY ON
INDRA'S WORD.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.231
