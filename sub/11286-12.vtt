I still can't believe you're
giving me the family recipe.

I'm gonna go now, 'cause
I'm feeling a little misty.

01:31.103 --> 01:32.236
Okay.

My mother just told me
how to make

her special marshmallow
and yam casserole.

you call yamallow.

‐ Compl‐compl‐compliments.
‐ Ha! Happy thanksgiving to ya.

01:48.236 --> 01:51.803
Max, you're supposed
to bring a side dish.

01:51.870 --> 01:54.903
These are corn chips.

01:54.970 --> 01:56.136

02:07.343 --> 02:09.543
We just hung out
a couple of times.

02:09.610 --> 02:12.476
And you know, at first I wasn't
really attracted to Darryl.

02:12.543 --> 02:15.043
Then he told me he wasn't
attracted to me either.

02:15.110 --> 02:17.776
And I became intrigued.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.776
I think it's wonderful

02:20.843 --> 02:23.043
that we're all bringing someone
special this thanksgiving.

‐ Who are you bringing, Max?
‐ I'm not bringing anyone.

Wait, I thought
you was bringing Michael.

02:35.010 --> 02:36.976
Oh, yeah, I am.
Good ol' Michael Johnson.

You don't even know
who you're bringing.

02:45.143 --> 02:46.543
Hello.

02:46.610 --> 02:50.010
Hi, Scooty‐pooty.

02:50.076 --> 02:52.010
Really? Why?

02:53.510 --> 02:55.876
Tsk, alright.
I'll wait.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.710
Okay, love you too.
Bye.

03:00.143 --> 03:05.016
Scooter says he has something
for me and something to ask me.

03:05.083 --> 03:09.616
Oh! Oh, girl!
I know that combination.

03:09.683 --> 03:13.316
You gonna be giving thanks
for an engagement ring.

03:13.383 --> 03:16.483
You better start practicing.

03:18.050 --> 03:20.383
That is ridiculous.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.383
You think that..

03:21.450 --> 03:22.383
No.

03:22.450 --> 03:23.383
Do ya think..

03:23.450 --> 03:24.683
No. No.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.216
Khadijah, you have
a good relationship.

03:26.283 --> 03:27.550
You're havin' good sex.

03:27.616 --> 03:29.083
Why would Scooter
wanna wipe out

03:29.150 --> 03:32.250
all that happiness
with a proposal?

03:33.383 --> 03:36.583
What would you say
if he did propose?

03:36.650 --> 03:37.983
I don't know.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.883
I'd say..

03:39.950 --> 03:41.050
I don't know.

03:41.116 --> 03:42.683
Say no, girl.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.983
I always do.

03:47.483 --> 03:51.383
As if anyone
has ever proposed to you.

03:51.450 --> 03:53.950
Twice. Thank you.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.550
Sure, they were screaming
their proposals

03:55.616 --> 03:57.916
at that critical moment.

03:57.983 --> 04:01.756
But technically, I had 'em.

04:01.823 --> 04:04.290
[laughing]

04:08.990 --> 04:13.256
‐ Obie, what's this?
‐ My practice bird.

04:13.323 --> 04:17.790
Do not take the honor of carvin'
the thanksgiving turkey lightly.

04:17.856 --> 04:20.690
It's man against beast.

04:22.723 --> 04:25.090
What's wrong
with your hands?

04:26.223 --> 04:29.723
‐ Hmm. French tips.
‐ Ha ha.

04:29.790 --> 04:32.790
Mm, you did 'em yourself.

04:34.356 --> 04:37.723
What? I always do my nails
for the holidays.

04:37.789 --> 04:39.690
Oh, please.

04:39.756 --> 04:42.956
You're tryin' to
set off a ring.

04:43.023 --> 04:43.956

04:44.023 --> 04:45.556
Can't a girl do her nails

04:45.623 --> 04:47.590

to be about a man?

[doorbell ringing]

04:48.656 --> 04:51.156
Oh, Scooter!

04:51.223 --> 04:53.623
‐ Hey.
‐ Michael.

04:54.856 --> 04:56.090
mwah

04:56.156 --> 04:58.390
‐ Glad you could make it.
‐ Yeah. It wasn't easy.

04:58.456 --> 05:00.423
I couldn't tell mom
I wouldn't be there

05:00.490 --> 05:04.296
for thanksgiving, so I snuck out
durin' the family prayer.

05:05.563 --> 05:07.330
‐ Won't they miss you?
‐ Nah.

05:07.396 --> 05:11.230
If I slip back durin' the family
argument, I'll be fine.

05:11.296 --> 05:14.563
So, Michael,
did you bring a side dish?

05:16.130 --> 05:18.363
There you go.

05:20.796 --> 05:23.696
How lovely.
Cranberry sauce.

05:26.830 --> 05:28.296
What the hell's
wrong with you?

05:28.363 --> 05:30.330
‐ What?
‐ I told you to bring a dip.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.396
Oh! Right, right.

[knock on door]

05:33.630 --> 05:37.496
Oh! I got it. I got it.

Oh, Michael.

05:49.196 --> 05:51.030
It's good to see
Max's old standby.

05:51.096 --> 05:52.663
That's me.

05:53.496 --> 05:56.796
Well, runnin' dry, huh?

05:56.863 --> 06:00.270
Oh, and look at your date.
Oh, she's so pretty.

06:00.336 --> 06:02.003
She must be an actress.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.603

do you work at?

06:05.670 --> 06:08.236
Well, actually I'm assistant
director of pediatrics

How you doin'?
Here you go.

06:26.436 --> 06:27.970
Got a little
somethin' for you.

(Regine)
'Thank you.'

06:30.436 --> 06:32.236
Um, everybody.
This is Darryl.

06:32.303 --> 06:37.070
This is Overton, Max, Khadijah,
Kyle, Josephine and Michael.

06:37.136 --> 06:39.870
‐ Hey, how's everybody.
‐ Hey, what's up, bro.

06:39.936 --> 06:42.303
Hey, hey, hey, brother.

06:45.736 --> 06:47.236
‐ It's alright.
‐ Come on, brother.

06:47.303 --> 06:48.403
Show a little love.

06:52.936 --> 06:54.036
Wow!

06:55.870 --> 06:58.670
Oh! He cracked my back.

07:00.276 --> 07:02.076
So, Darryl, man.
What do you do?

07:02.143 --> 07:04.176
Oh, I work for
a American parcel service.

07:04.243 --> 07:05.943
I'm responsible
for getting important packages

07:06.010 --> 07:08.610
to vital locations
in a timely fashion.

07:09.943 --> 07:11.143
I don't get it.

07:11.210 --> 07:14.176
You only date VIP's
who drive German cars.

07:14.243 --> 07:16.743
He drives a Volkswagen.

07:16.810 --> 07:17.743
How?

07:21.110 --> 07:23.676
So Darryl, tell me man,
how did you two meet?

07:23.743 --> 07:26.976
Oh, I had to deliver a priority
letter to Regine's boutique.

07:27.043 --> 07:29.610
Although, I wasn't paying her
that much attention at first.

07:29.676 --> 07:33.610
Back in the truck, I know it's
the way she signed my clipboard.

07:33.676 --> 07:34.643
Just R.

07:35.810 --> 07:37.610
I knew I had to go back.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.743
Oh, you found her mysterious.

07:40.810 --> 07:43.810
No, you see, the law requires
that I get a full signature.

07:45.410 --> 07:50.543
So, uh, Darryl...what exactly
are your intentions

07:50.610 --> 07:52.076
towards our little Regine.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.810
Oh, well,
it's quite simple, Overton.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.943
You see, I intend
to treat Regine as well as I can

07:59.010 --> 08:00.750
for as long as she'll let me.

08:05.616 --> 08:06.550
Good answer.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.083
‐ You a rare brother.
‐ Thank you.

08:14.016 --> 08:16.516
Step off, Jezebel.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.050
What is that unusual smell?

08:22.116 --> 08:25.183
Oh, that's my cousin
Synclaire's yamallow.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.483
What? Homemade yamallow?

08:26.550 --> 08:29.283
I'm so sick of the instant,
can I check this out.

08:29.350 --> 08:31.716
Oh, man.
I'll be right back.

08:31.783 --> 08:34.015
This'll give y'all a chance
to talk about me.

08:34.082 --> 08:36.116
You know what I'm saying.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.750
I find the brother
totally refreshing.

08:40.216 --> 08:41.515
Yeah, I know, right.

08:41.582 --> 08:43.482
After dating all those
pretentious jerks

08:43.549 --> 08:46.850
it's kinda nice hanging out
with somebody that's real.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.683
Regine, let's not
beat around the bush

08:48.750 --> 08:52.250
some people are born big, some
just eat a lot, which one is he?

08:58.416 --> 08:59.716
[doorbell rings]

08:59.783 --> 09:02.690
Alright, that's Scooter.
No body move.

09:02.756 --> 09:04.623
‐ Okay, Khadijah, Khadijah.
‐ Yeah?

09:04.690 --> 09:06.556
Stay cool.

09:06.623 --> 09:09.090
This is it, this is it.

09:11.423 --> 09:13.390
Hey.

09:13.456 --> 09:14.790
Hi, everybody.

09:14.856 --> 09:16.356
(everyone)
Hi!

09:19.490 --> 09:20.756
Come on in, baby.

09:29.623 --> 09:31.590
Is there some place else
we can talk?

09:31.656 --> 09:32.790
Nope.

09:34.756 --> 09:35.890
Come on.

09:37.090 --> 09:39.323
If you rub a lemon
on the cutting board

09:39.390 --> 09:41.490
your eyes won't water,
dicing the onion.

09:41.556 --> 09:43.390
Oh.

09:43.456 --> 09:45.956
Hey, I didn't realize you guys
were still in here.

09:46.023 --> 09:48.290
Darryl, this is Terrence.
Terrence, that's Darryl.

09:48.356 --> 09:50.423
‐ What's up, man?
‐ How you doing?

09:52.823 --> 09:54.456
He does that. It's alright.

09:54.523 --> 09:57.556
Can you guys excuse us
for a minute? We need to talk.

09:57.623 --> 09:59.996
Darryl was about to show us
bachelor's casserole

10:00.063 --> 10:01.163
from left overs.

10:01.230 --> 10:05.396
Ah, yes, the secret
ingredient...paprika.

10:05.463 --> 10:06.730
Get out of here.

10:10.530 --> 10:15.496
Khadijah...I've been waiting for
the right time to give you this.

10:15.563 --> 10:17.196
Oh, my God.

10:18.630 --> 10:21.730
Scooter, I would never have..

10:21.796 --> 10:23.196
It's a locket.

10:25.496 --> 10:28.263
So you can open it
and think of me.

10:28.330 --> 10:31.763
Or I can just look
at you, right?

10:31.830 --> 10:34.563
I didn't want to tell you
until I knew for sure.

10:34.630 --> 10:35.896
I met the group Jasmine

10:35.963 --> 10:37.696
and they've asked me
to manage 'em.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.530
Managing a group?

10:39.596 --> 10:42.096
‐ That's your dream.
‐ Yeah.

10:42.163 --> 10:45.430
If I take the job
I have to go on a world tour

10:45.496 --> 10:47.763
with them for six months.

10:47.830 --> 10:49.663
Starting Monday.

10:58.161 --> 11:00.794
Uh, wait, wait
let me understand this.

11:00.861 --> 11:05.134
Jasmine wants you to manage 'em,
and go on a six‐month tour?

11:05.201 --> 11:06.567
That's right.

11:06.634 --> 11:08.634
I won't go unless
you're cool with it.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.767
Baby, I don't want
to hold you back.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.801
I don't want
to stand in your way.

11:12.867 --> 11:17.267
I won't keep you from going,
but I don't want you to go.

11:17.334 --> 11:21.834
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot you two were in here.

11:21.901 --> 11:25.001
What's this? A ring box?

11:25.067 --> 11:28.267
No, it's not.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.701
I'm going to go now. Bye‐bye!

11:33.367 --> 11:36.867
I did just spring this on you.
It is a lot to take in.

11:36.934 --> 11:38.401
Maybe you need time to think.

11:38.467 --> 11:41.867
‐ Yeah, about six months.
‐ Khadijah, come on.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.167
Hey, you asked and I answered.

11:44.234 --> 11:46.667
I don't think you should go.

11:46.734 --> 11:49.501
Then I guess that's it.
I won't go.

11:49.567 --> 11:52.067
I can't say I think
you're being fair on this.

11:52.134 --> 11:54.101
‐ I'm not being fair?
‐ No. forget it, alright.

11:54.167 --> 11:55.634
I'll tell them no.

11:55.701 --> 11:56.667
‐ Well, cool.
‐ Cool!

11:56.734 --> 11:57.667
‐ Cool!
‐ Cool!

11:57.734 --> 11:58.701
Hey, cool!

12:01.774 --> 12:04.174
Uh, everything okay?

12:04.241 --> 12:05.607
Oh, fine.

12:05.674 --> 12:08.674
Scooter's been asked to go on a
world tour and manage Jasmine.

12:08.741 --> 12:09.741
Oh, that's great.

12:09.807 --> 12:11.307
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Congratulations, man.

12:11.374 --> 12:15.074
Those bony girls that don't wear
nothing on stage?

12:15.141 --> 12:17.141
Yeah, but I'm not
taking the job.

12:17.207 --> 12:22.041
Because someone decided it's not
a good idea for me to go.

12:22.107 --> 12:29.007
Well, someone just
sprung this on someone.

12:29.074 --> 12:35.474
We all know who you're talking
about. Next time, use pig Latin.

12:35.541 --> 12:37.807
Terrence, I hope
you don't mind me saying this

12:37.874 --> 12:39.174
but that group is weak.

12:39.241 --> 12:42.407
All they ever sing about
is letting a man control you.

12:42.474 --> 12:44.207
Well, that's not such
a bad thing.

12:44.274 --> 12:46.007
‐ Yes, it is.
‐ It's bad for women.

12:46.074 --> 12:50.141
It's bad for men.
Just bad all around.

12:50.207 --> 12:52.841
Show a little backbone, brother.

12:52.907 --> 12:55.007
What are you talking about?

12:55.074 --> 12:57.474
Scooter, is the invertebrate
not going on tour.

12:57.541 --> 13:00.547
'Cause his woman told him no.

13:03.781 --> 13:05.681
I need some air.

13:05.747 --> 13:07.547
You want to join me, bro?

13:08.981 --> 13:11.314
I‐I‐I'll join you.
Yeah, I'll join you

13:11.381 --> 13:12.847
In my family,
it's a tradition

13:12.914 --> 13:15.414
before people sit down to eat,
the men go outside

13:15.481 --> 13:17.214
for a talk in the evening chill.

13:17.281 --> 13:19.514
Kinda gets the chest hairs
to stand on end.

13:30.114 --> 13:32.481
Shoot, it's cold!

13:35.414 --> 13:38.147
I was trying to do the right
thing by asking Khadijah.

13:38.214 --> 13:41.247
‐ How could she say no.
‐ Ah! first mistake, my brother.

13:41.314 --> 13:43.114
Never ask a woman anything

13:43.181 --> 13:45.414
She'll either give you answer
you do not want

13:45.481 --> 13:47.714
or she will answer your question
with a question.

13:47.781 --> 13:49.281
Oh, my God, that's Max's emo.

13:49.347 --> 13:50.981
Answer the question
with a question.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.447
And it's always
the same question.

13:53.514 --> 13:56.614
"What the hell
is wrong with you?"

13:56.681 --> 13:58.447
Women! You know what I'm saying?

13:58.514 --> 14:00.487
Nah, brother. I think
that's just your woman.

14:02.421 --> 14:04.654
Can't Khadijah see this is
the kind of opportunity

14:04.721 --> 14:06.187
that could set our life.

14:06.254 --> 14:08.554
I just can't believe
he's being this selfish.

14:08.621 --> 14:10.087
We're just getting
our thing going

14:10.154 --> 14:12.387
and I'm supposed
to let him leave like that?

14:12.454 --> 14:14.187
Men are just born selfish.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.987
You know, I know
what you're saying.

14:16.054 --> 14:17.754
'Cause even in
the maternity ward

14:17.821 --> 14:20.121
these little boys
they wanna be fed, changed

14:20.187 --> 14:22.121
and burped all at the same time.

14:22.187 --> 14:25.954
Now, little girls, they
practically diaper themselves.

14:26.021 --> 14:29.487
I remember that.

14:29.554 --> 14:34.121
Well, the truth is Scooter made
his decision before he got here.

14:34.187 --> 14:37.321
No, no, no. Asking me
was one big lie.

14:37.387 --> 14:39.054
Khadijah, remember in
"The Godfather"

14:39.121 --> 14:41.487
when Diane Keaton
asked Al Pacino

14:41.554 --> 14:43.321
if he had his
brother‐in‐law killed.

14:43.387 --> 14:48.754
And he looks her dead in the eye
and says no, even though he did?

14:48.821 --> 14:50.654
‐ That's men!
‐ It is! It is!

14:50.721 --> 14:51.887
[indistinct chattering]

14:51.954 --> 14:54.454
Not to cause a crack
in the wall of sisterhood

14:54.521 --> 14:56.721
but maybe you should
let Scooter go.

14:56.787 --> 15:00.021
What? Why do I have to be
the mature one?

15:00.087 --> 15:03.594
I don't want my man to go.
I want my man to stay here!

15:03.661 --> 15:08.127
Here, here, here!

15:08.194 --> 15:09.594
Khadijah should understand.

15:09.661 --> 15:12.161
It's not like I'm trying
to leave her.

15:12.227 --> 15:14.194
Well, you would be
getting on a plane

15:14.261 --> 15:16.227
and going away for six months.

15:16.294 --> 15:20.127
If that's not leaving,
it's an incredible simulation.

15:20.194 --> 15:23.227
Six months apart is a long time,
but I'm coming back.

15:23.294 --> 15:25.261
Yeah, but she don't
see it that way.

15:25.327 --> 15:27.827
You see, what Khadijah needs
is a sense of security.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.761
Why, on my first date
with Regine, I bought her

15:30.827 --> 15:32.261
a steering wheel lock.

15:34.327 --> 15:36.727
Yeah, she knew I cared.

15:36.794 --> 15:39.827
So, instead of a locket I should
have gotten her the lock.

15:39.894 --> 15:43.027
‐ That's right.
‐ I got an idea.

15:43.094 --> 15:45.827
Why don't you invite Jasmine
over and let Khadijah meet 'em?

15:45.894 --> 15:47.861
And maybe she'll see
that while incredibly beautiful

15:47.927 --> 15:50.194
they are absolutely
no threat to her.

15:50.261 --> 15:52.294
No, I don't think
that would help.

15:52.361 --> 15:54.327
No, but it would help me.

15:54.394 --> 15:56.327
Maybe you should just reason
with Khadijah.

15:56.394 --> 15:58.727
I mean, she's a rational woman.

15:58.794 --> 16:01.167
Oh, Max on the other hand.

16:01.234 --> 16:03.101
Man, she's tough.

16:03.167 --> 16:05.401
Man, I don't know
how you deal with her.

16:05.467 --> 16:06.601
I meditate.

16:07.767 --> 16:11.201
For a hour before a date
and after.

16:12.434 --> 16:15.034
Sometimes during.

16:15.101 --> 16:18.567
You know the problem is, we have
given women too much power.

16:18.634 --> 16:21.534
I heard that.

16:21.601 --> 16:24.134
You know, it's about time
we men start reclaiming it.

16:24.201 --> 16:25.301
That's right.

16:25.367 --> 16:26.934
My brothers, I propose a pact.

16:27.001 --> 16:28.601
Well, propose on, then.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.767
From now on, we decide
our own fate.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.901
Well!

16:33.967 --> 16:36.134
We ask no one for approval.

16:36.201 --> 16:37.134
(together)
That's right.

16:37.201 --> 16:40.867
Because no woman
will tell us what to do.

16:40.934 --> 16:42.167
‐ Alright!
‐ Why?

16:42.234 --> 16:43.401
(together)
Why?

16:43.467 --> 16:45.001
Because we're men!

16:45.067 --> 16:46.834
(together)
Ready? Break!

16:49.834 --> 16:52.201
(Synclaire)
'Guys! Come and eat!'

16:57.434 --> 16:59.434
Okay. let's say grace.

16:59.501 --> 17:01.074
I'll start.

17:04.906 --> 17:09.307
Thank you for the love that
binds us no matter where we are.

17:09.374 --> 17:14.607
No matter how far apart
in the world.

17:14.674 --> 17:19.273
Thank you for the fact that we
can all be here, together.

17:19.340 --> 17:22.707
Where we all belong, together.

17:24.340 --> 17:26.741
Thank you for all of these
wonderful people

17:26.807 --> 17:31.841
and wonderful food
highlighted by yamallow

17:31.907 --> 17:35.941
and the turkey
expertly carved by my Obie.

17:36.007 --> 17:37.707
Thank you for that compliment..

17:37.774 --> 17:41.807
...delivered through your child,
and my girl Synclaire.

17:44.341 --> 17:47.241
I'd like to give thanks
for not having to eat

17:47.307 --> 17:50.874
hospital cafeteria turkey cubes.

17:50.941 --> 17:53.941
I'd like to give thanks
for all the love in this room

17:54.007 --> 17:56.907
and for my date, the doctor.

18:02.181 --> 18:07.714
I thank God for all this food
of great variety and quantity

18:07.781 --> 18:12.281
and for the opportunity to share
it with my very special man

18:12.347 --> 18:13.681
for the evening.

18:16.647 --> 18:19.014
Thank you for the gift
of meditation.

18:25.381 --> 18:31.214
I give thanks for my family
and my friends, old and new.

18:35.281 --> 18:39.014
At Thanksgiving it's a tradition
to give thanks.

18:39.081 --> 18:42.314
Me, I'd like to offer
thanks for giving.

18:42.381 --> 18:44.114
'Cause you see
giving teaches us something

18:44.181 --> 18:45.747
that receiving doesn't.

18:45.814 --> 18:48.581
It allows us
to look deep within ourselves.

18:48.647 --> 18:50.814
And so, thank you.

18:50.881 --> 18:54.114
Thank you for this special day
when we can turn to those

18:54.181 --> 18:57.881
who are closest to us and give
them what they need most.

18:57.947 --> 18:58.881
Amen.

18:58.947 --> 19:01.387
(together)
Amen.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.621
Terrence, can I speak to you
for a minute outside, please?

19:09.687 --> 19:10.687
Sure.

19:18.054 --> 19:21.521
Ah, relationships are tough.

19:21.587 --> 19:23.154
(together)
Yeah.

19:23.221 --> 19:25.054
‐ Pass me them taters.
‐ Okay!

19:31.954 --> 19:35.354
Look, Scooter, this is no way to
spend the Thanksgiving.

19:35.421 --> 19:38.921
I don't wanna keep you here only
to have you resent me for it.

19:38.987 --> 19:43.687
I really think you should go
on this tour.

19:43.754 --> 19:46.921
‐ Are you sure?
‐ Yes.

19:46.987 --> 19:51.321
Every relationship has its tests
and I guess this is ours.

19:51.387 --> 19:55.654
So I'm giving you my love,
and I'm letting you go.

19:57.987 --> 20:01.327
‐ Six months is a long time.
‐ A real long time.

20:02.861 --> 20:04.894
But we can get through it.

20:04.961 --> 20:05.994
We'll write every day.

20:06.061 --> 20:07.294
I'll call you every night.

20:07.361 --> 20:09.494
‐ We'll send videos.
‐ And little cassette messages.

20:09.561 --> 20:12.727
‐ We'll be fine.
‐ Yeah.

20:12.794 --> 20:16.427
What am I saying,
you're going to Tokyo, man.

20:18.861 --> 20:20.827
I guess, I'm not
really letting you go

20:20.894 --> 20:24.627
if I try to hold on this tight.

20:24.694 --> 20:27.194
I don't want to let go
of you at all.

20:38.894 --> 20:40.427
Remember when we were kids?

20:40.494 --> 20:43.494
We used to race to see
if we could outrun the moon?

20:43.561 --> 20:47.761
Whenever we looked back,
there it was.

20:47.827 --> 20:50.227
That's how I feel about us.

20:50.294 --> 20:52.361
Wherever I'm at in the world.

20:52.427 --> 20:55.861
Whenever I see the moon,
I'll think of you.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.901
Scooter, I love the locket.

21:03.967 --> 21:06.334
But don't you ever
bring me a ring box

21:06.401 --> 21:08.534
that does not
have a ring in it.

21:12.034 --> 21:13.834
I won't.

21:14.734 --> 21:17.167
[mellow music]

21:41.334 --> 21:44.267
[snoring]
