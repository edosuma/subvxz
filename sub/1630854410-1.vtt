WEBVTT

01:31.375 --> 01:34.083
The targets name
is Hector Velasco.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.208
Lieutenant Briggs,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.750
you are authorized to take them
out by any means necessary.

01:40.083 --> 01:41.750
About time we got
some action in here.

01:42.167 --> 01:43.583
I was starting to get bored.

01:44.167 --> 01:47.208
The other 2 squads are a
Texas Rangers joint task force.

01:47.833 --> 01:50.333
Sergeant Jax Maxwell
will be in charge of team 2.

01:50.667 --> 01:51.958
We've got your back Lieutenant.

01:52.375 --> 01:54.875
My men are well trained
and this ain't our first rodeo.

01:55.375 --> 01:59.208
Sergeant Maxwell and I
have formed a trusting
relationship over the years.

01:59.875 --> 02:01.083
He won't let you down.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.208
What every you need,
we got you covered.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.475
Team 3 is lead by
Sergeant Tyler Stevens.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.250
We've been surveilling this
compound for a few weeks now.

02:09.542 --> 02:11.375
We know every square
inch of that place.

02:11.750 --> 02:12.583
Get this right,

02:12.584 --> 02:14.875
and you'll have many more
opportunities like this one.

02:17.375 --> 02:18.875
Opportunites like what?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.500
Director Johnson, what
do I owe this pleasure to?

02:22.875 --> 02:24.042
I see you're doing the uh,

02:24.542 --> 02:25.708
Velasco raid tonight.

02:26.333 --> 02:27.733
Yes, we just
concluded our briefing.

02:28.458 --> 02:31.178
These are my squad leaders who
are entering the compound this
evening.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.042
Look Sully,

02:32.333 --> 02:33.333
Just don't fuck this up.

02:33.542 --> 02:34.782
We've got a lot riding on this.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
You know...

02:37.083 --> 02:38.375
You keep making me look good,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.200
maybe one of these days
you'll be able to fill my shoes.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.500
Yes sir, I understand.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.495
Do whatever it takes to
take this son of a bitch down.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.999
I expect to be doing a press
release first thing tomorrow,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.667
where I can tell the world that
I
captured another Cartel leader.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.810
You might have to
get dirty on this one.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.332
Well you got the
right guy for the job.

02:55.333 --> 02:56.208
Yeah well,

02:56.209 --> 02:57.333
that remains to be seen.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.083
Carry on.

03:00.708 --> 03:03.083
I've got your full
release, you fucking prick.

03:03.958 --> 03:06.038
Alright ladies and gentlemen,
you've got your orders.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.208
Dismissed.

03:53.958 --> 03:55.457
Good evening ladies
and Gentlemen.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.958
Welcome to flight 187 to Laredo.

03:58.750 --> 04:02.000
Pucker up buttercups, ETA
30 minutes to rendezvous point.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.708
Hold on to your tampons.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.082
Damnit Roscoe!

04:08.083 --> 04:09.208
Yee-haw!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.332
There she is girls.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.500
The Rio Grande.

04:36.667 --> 04:37.958
But we gotta be quick,

04:38.333 --> 04:39.874
the guards patrol
about every hour.

04:39.875 --> 04:40.875
What?

04:40.876 --> 04:42.236
We're supposed
to swim across that?

04:42.375 --> 04:43.999
I can't swim that far!

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I've got you covered.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.582
We're supposed to go in this?

04:51.583 --> 04:53.374
No, the drugs go into this.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.207
But you hang on the
outside and paddle.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.874
It will keep your from drowning.

04:56.875 --> 04:57.875
What?

04:59.875 --> 05:02.375
Shirts, pants, and
shoes in the bag.

05:20.042 --> 05:21.042
We're ready.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.750
Alright girls, we
swim from here.

05:28.042 --> 05:29.042
Hang onto the tube.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.083
There you go.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.250
Hang on.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.082
Whatever you do girls,

05:38.083 --> 05:39.375
don't let go.

05:39.875 --> 05:42.042
If I go down stream,
you don't get paid.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.125
Stroke!

05:44.583 --> 05:45.833
Stroke!

05:46.458 --> 05:47.708
Stroke!

05:48.250 --> 05:49.500
You see the bank over there?

05:49.750 --> 05:50.458
No!

05:50.459 --> 05:51.832
That's where we're going.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.124
I don't see it!

05:53.125 --> 05:54.083
It's there.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.083
We're getting close.

05:55.084 --> 05:56.332
I still see nothing!

05:56.333 --> 05:57.333
Swim!

06:12.667 --> 06:13.916
Amigo!

06:13.917 --> 06:15.374
I started to think you
weren't going to make it.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.000
Have faith compadre,
I always deliver.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.749
Looks like you
brought some friends,

06:19.750 --> 06:21.083
are we gonna party later?

06:22.833 --> 06:24.750
Let's just call them
business associates.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.250
And,

06:26.251 --> 06:27.624
they brought a little
present for Hector.

06:27.625 --> 06:28.832
Hmm,

06:28.833 --> 06:29.833
I bet they did.

06:29.833 --> 06:30.833
Well,

06:30.875 --> 06:31.875
Boss is expecting you.

06:32.875 --> 06:33.995
Better not keep him waiting.

06:34.958 --> 06:36.082
Let's get going.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.083
Ladies?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.250
Halto!

07:15.583 --> 07:16.500
Que tienes?

07:16.501 --> 07:17.832
It's cool they're with me.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.167
Boss is expecting us.

07:44.667 --> 07:45.874
You guys are late.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.208
But we're here now.

08:00.333 --> 08:01.708
Who's this?

08:02.042 --> 08:04.875
Special deliveries,
compliments of Guillermo.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.333
You search them?

08:07.667 --> 08:09.082
Nah.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.542
You're paranoid man.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.082
Turn around.

08:13.083 --> 08:14.374
Arms up.

08:14.375 --> 08:15.749
Legs out.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.167
Knock yourself out.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.375
Okay, he's clean.

08:29.458 --> 08:30.707
What about you?

08:30.708 --> 08:32.082
Hiding anything
special under there?

08:32.083 --> 08:33.083
Nope.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.750
Okay, she's clean.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.333
Come on, you're next.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.457
Be gentle!

08:47.458 --> 08:49.124
A little sensative are we?

08:49.125 --> 08:50.750
You have no idea.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.916
Okay, they're clean.

08:52.917 --> 08:54.416
Go on through.

08:54.417 --> 08:55.666
Boss is in the back.

08:55.667 --> 08:56.625
Guillermo!

08:56.625 --> 08:57.625
Mr. Velasco!

08:59.292 --> 09:01.875
It looks like you
had a safe trip huh.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.332
Just another day over the
river and through the woods.

09:05.333 --> 09:06.958
Let's see what's in the bags.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.999
I am very impressed
with your shipment.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.042
Nah.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.082
That's with just 2 girls.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.000
Imagine what I could do with 20.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.167
Besides,

09:41.168 --> 09:42.582
You haven't seen
the best part yet.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.999
Oh really?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.500
What have you brought for me?

09:45.833 --> 09:48.000
2 very special deliveries.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.333
So far I'm liking
what I am seeing.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.708
Can't wait for you
to show me more.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.208
Ladies.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.875
I want you to relax.

10:10.167 --> 10:11.832
This should go quick

10:11.833 --> 10:13.625
and easy.

10:16.875 --> 10:17.875
Ooh...

10:25.708 --> 10:26.749
Are you ready?

10:26.750 --> 10:28.042
Do I have a choice?

10:28.375 --> 10:30.374
What goes in must come out.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.375
Oh I just hope nothing
extra comes out.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.375
Ooh,

10:39.875 --> 10:40.875
Oh little daddy!

10:42.583 --> 10:43.583
See!

10:43.708 --> 10:44.875
That wasn't so bad.

10:46.833 --> 10:48.542
And you took it like a trooper.

10:49.458 --> 10:50.625
Alright ladies.

10:51.708 --> 10:52.458
We're done here.

10:52.708 --> 10:53.708
Get dressed.

10:54.875 --> 10:56.000
That's it?

10:56.750 --> 10:58.250
I thought there
was gonna be more.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.416
Where's my big fucking surprise?

11:00.417 --> 11:02.042
Easy, just hold on a second.

11:04.167 --> 11:05.167
Girls.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.000
As promised.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.499
Go on, get your packs.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.542
Get out of here.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.958
Now for your surprise.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.332
Let's see what the
Easter Egg reveal

11:27.333 --> 11:28.958
has in store for us.

11:29.708 --> 11:31.749
What do we have here?

11:31.750 --> 11:33.749
Pure Fentanyl.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.208
Nice!

11:35.750 --> 11:39.000
People are buying those
pills left and right off the
street.

11:39.625 --> 11:40.625
This...

11:41.375 --> 11:43.291
Is one of the easier
things to market bro.

11:43.292 --> 11:44.792
Easy with that bro!

11:45.792 --> 11:47.500
A speck of that will kill ya!

11:58.125 --> 11:59.999
Adam 1 to Lincoln 2,
what's your current status?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.208
Lincoln 2, all
units are in postion.

12:02.583 --> 12:03.583
Over.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.874
Captain Sully, looks like
we have satellite uplink.

12:08.875 --> 12:11.208
Activating thermal imaging feed.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.832
Maintain your position,

12:14.833 --> 12:16.082
and hold the perimeter.

12:16.083 --> 12:20.125
It's good to finally meet theman
that has been making me very
rich.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.832
We nearly doubled our
sales in the past few months.

12:24.833 --> 12:27.749
Thank you for allowing
me to showcase my...

12:27.750 --> 12:29.000
unique talents.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.667
But I'm curious.

12:32.583 --> 12:35.583
How do you get so much
movement across the border

12:36.500 --> 12:38.083
without any trouble?

12:39.333 --> 12:40.500
It's easy.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.000
I just use the back door.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.708
I think you're cool
damn white boy.

12:52.375 --> 12:55.083
We're going to get
very rich together man.

12:55.833 --> 12:57.167
Oh yeah.

13:04.875 --> 13:08.707
Lincold 2, neutralize hostiles
and
proceed to the main target area.

13:08.708 --> 13:09.708
Copy that.

13:51.250 --> 13:54.875
All teams are clear to engage
the primary target on your mark.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Cut the power.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.000
What the fuck was that?

14:04.250 --> 14:05.970
I don't know boss,
sounded like the breaker.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Escorpion,

14:09.333 --> 14:10.457
go and check the panel.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.458
Got it.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.624
Get down on the ground!

14:16.625 --> 14:17.707
Drop your weapons!

14:17.708 --> 14:18.708
Get down on the ground!

14:18.708 --> 14:19.625
Drop your weapons!

14:19.625 --> 14:20.125
Clear!

14:20.125 --> 14:20.833
Clear!

14:20.834 --> 14:22.833
Eat dick fucking pigs!

14:25.250 --> 14:26.624
Get down on the ground!

14:26.625 --> 14:27.250
Freeze motherfucker!

14:27.251 --> 14:28.749
Get your hands on your head!

14:28.750 --> 14:30.166
Get your knees!

14:30.167 --> 14:31.374
Get down asshole!

14:31.375 --> 14:32.167
Get down!

14:32.168 --> 14:33.375
Hand on your head!

14:38.125 --> 14:39.875
Okay Roscoe, take us down.

14:44.708 --> 14:45.832
Hector Velasco,

14:45.833 --> 14:46.833
you are under arrest

14:46.834 --> 14:48.624
for the trafficking and sales

14:48.625 --> 14:50.582
of illegal narcotics and weapons

14:50.583 --> 14:52.750
into The United
States of America.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.708
Identification please.

15:19.833 --> 15:22.167
Captain Richard Sully,
Department of Homeland Security.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.207
Ah, Captain Sully.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.832
It's an honor to meet you.

15:25.833 --> 15:26.750
Thank you sir.

15:26.750 --> 15:27.708
Please, proceed.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.833
Agent.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.333
Jesus Christ, what
a fucking mess.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.208
1 1911 automatic pistol.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.208
Gold plated hand grips.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.833
These Cartels always
have great taste.

15:49.208 --> 15:52.750
Excellent work team, you
should all be proud of
yourselves.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.208
Get him out of here.

16:01.875 --> 16:03.167
Move it Velasco.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.707
Get those cuffs off of him!

16:06.708 --> 16:08.042
Yes sir!

16:14.708 --> 16:15.708
May I?

16:16.250 --> 16:17.583
Yeah, Yeah of course.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.417
You really outdid
yourself this time.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.874
18 months in deep cover is no...

16:38.875 --> 16:39.750
walk..

16:39.750 --> 16:40.750
In the park!

16:41.417 --> 16:42.749
No sir, it is not.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.917
Well thanks to you Bill,
your intel was spot on.

16:45.417 --> 16:47.583
Everything was smooth.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.250
Ah, Stevens...

16:51.750 --> 16:52.999
Go round up the 2 girls.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.750
They couldn't have
gotten very far on foot.

16:55.458 --> 16:56.624
Bring back the cash,

16:56.625 --> 16:59.583
and make sure you put them
in detention right after that.

17:00.208 --> 17:01.208
Right away Captain.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.582
Well it looks like you
got quite a haul here Bill.

17:07.583 --> 17:08.583
So what have we got?

17:09.125 --> 17:11.250
We have 1.4 Million in cash.

17:11.792 --> 17:12.625
Cool.

17:12.626 --> 17:14.416
6 Killos of pure uncut cocain.

17:14.417 --> 17:15.417
Good.

17:15.875 --> 17:17.249
A couple pounds
of Marijuana here,

17:17.250 --> 17:18.750
another 50 pounds out back.

17:19.542 --> 17:21.249
A few miscellaneous weapons.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.750
Enough fentanyl to
overdose the entire Agency.

17:24.583 --> 17:25.583
Hey Bill.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.333
What the hell is this?

17:27.958 --> 17:32.708
Some kind of a drug they
melted down to disguise to look
like a Voodoo candle?

17:34.125 --> 17:35.708
Strangely scented.

17:36.458 --> 17:37.583
That sir...

17:38.125 --> 17:39.208
is a butt plug.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.500
Oh!

17:44.000 --> 17:47.333
My senses told me that it might
have been used in some type of

17:47.708 --> 17:48.749
foul play.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.708
I had it filled with fentanyl
to make use of the uh...

17:52.125 --> 17:53.375
extra space.

17:53.750 --> 17:54.791
Oh good.

17:54.792 --> 17:55.625
Good.

17:55.626 --> 17:57.625
You could be up for
promotion on this one.

17:58.208 --> 18:00.666
Are you sure you won't
reconcider your retirement,

18:00.667 --> 18:02.208
and stay a little bit longer?

18:02.500 --> 18:03.208
Nope.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
I've put in my time.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.708
I'm ready for the simple life.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.499
Spend a little time
with the family.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.083
Yeah.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.583
Maybe find a

18:11.083 --> 18:13.250
log cabin up by
a nice clear lake.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.375
Mmm.

18:14.376 --> 18:15.833
That does sound wonderful.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.500
You know, I always thought I
would be the first one to
retire.

18:20.208 --> 18:21.208
You know what?

18:22.208 --> 18:24.208
I just can't seem
to let all of this go.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.375
It can be fulfilling.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.250
I don't know what I
would do without this job.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.500
I mean, I just need
something else.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.708
Something to fill that void.

18:34.083 --> 18:34.708
Sir.

18:34.709 --> 18:37.374
You know, Margaret
is ready for a change.

18:37.375 --> 18:37.875
Sir.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.500
She would like to spend
more time together and...

18:40.708 --> 18:41.749
oh and...

18:41.750 --> 18:42.750
try new things.

18:42.875 --> 18:43.542
Captain!

18:43.542 --> 18:44.542
Yeah?

18:44.583 --> 18:46.166
You're handling the evidence.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.167
Huh?

18:48.375 --> 18:49.375
Silly me!

18:53.708 --> 18:55.208
Yeah, um...

18:55.583 --> 18:56.583
How's that?

18:59.750 --> 19:01.542
Tricky piece of machinery huh?

19:02.500 --> 19:03.083
Okay.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.083
Where was I?

19:04.375 --> 19:05.042
Oh!

19:05.043 --> 19:06.708
Hey, speaking of
the back woods...

19:07.458 --> 19:08.874
You know Bill, it's
standard protocol

19:08.875 --> 19:10.457
that we place agents on a

19:10.458 --> 19:13.833
light duty assignment after
receiving 2 week retirement
notice?

19:15.583 --> 19:18.083
What's that got to do
with the back woods?

19:19.083 --> 19:20.582
Don't hate me Bill,

19:20.583 --> 19:23.042
But I'm putting in your
transfer request tonight.

19:23.375 --> 19:25.999
You'll be finishing
your last 2 weeks...

19:26.000 --> 19:27.083
in the FIRE unit.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.375
FIRE?

19:28.583 --> 19:30.582
That new Agency Donald started
at the beginning of the year?

19:30.583 --> 19:31.167
Yep!

19:31.500 --> 19:32.500
The one and only.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.083
You are an official member

19:34.500 --> 19:35.750
of the Forrest and Immigration

19:36.250 --> 19:37.250
Raking Enforcement.

19:37.708 --> 19:38.868
You're fucking with me right?

19:39.333 --> 19:40.958
Nope, you start tomorrow.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.999
Hey, hey, hey, guys, I'll
take care of these myself.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.374
I'm gonna box
these all up and...

19:52.375 --> 19:53.999
I'm gonna put it in my unit.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.582
And then I'm gonna take
them and have them anal

19:55.583 --> 19:56.125
uh,

19:56.125 --> 19:57.125
analized.

19:58.375 --> 19:59.667
Whatever you say Captain.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.500
I'll see you all
back at the station.

20:02.750 --> 20:03.792
Good work team.

20:04.167 --> 20:05.375
You guys take it from here.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Carry on!

20:08.875 --> 20:10.749
Alright, so I'll take
the cash in here,

20:10.750 --> 20:12.707
you bag up the weed
and the guns in your duffel

20:12.708 --> 20:15.028
and bring them to Transport
3, and I'll take it from there.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.499
Go home Bill, let
these guys handle it.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.875
Get some rest, you
have a big day tomorrow!

20:21.875 --> 20:22.875
Take care!

20:28.333 --> 20:31.250
That evidence has not been
properly bagged or tagged.

20:31.833 --> 20:33.832
We'll take care of it
later, don't worry about it!

20:33.833 --> 20:34.999
Don't worry about it?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.250
This is my bust.

20:36.958 --> 20:38.208
I'm responsible

20:38.500 --> 20:40.500
for the oversight
of this evidence

20:40.750 --> 20:41.917
and proper chain of custody.

20:42.167 --> 20:43.167
Now...

20:43.375 --> 20:44.917
Who is your commanding officer?

20:46.583 --> 20:47.583
Let it be.

20:47.708 --> 20:48.788
It ain't worth the trouble.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.583
Alright pops, have at it.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.833
Sweet dreams

21:01.333 --> 21:02.750
poor motherfucker.

22:04.875 --> 22:05.875
One

22:05.875 --> 22:06.750
point

22:06.751 --> 22:07.874
four

22:07.875 --> 22:08.999
million

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
dollars.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.083
I have a felling somebody's
gonna come looking for you.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.374
2 more weeks,

23:36.375 --> 23:37.832
cabin in the woods.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.208
Fuck this shit!

24:14.375 --> 24:16.583
You know the great
part about dummies?

24:18.208 --> 24:19.375
What's that?

24:20.583 --> 24:21.875
They don't punch back.

24:27.875 --> 24:28.999
Oh yeah?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.249
What do you know about fighting?

24:31.250 --> 24:33.708
I thought you
specialized in raking?

24:34.208 --> 24:35.500
Really Trixie?

24:36.875 --> 24:38.083
I know a few moves.

24:38.333 --> 24:39.958
Hmm, you think
you could take this?

24:41.458 --> 24:43.042
All night long.

24:43.833 --> 24:45.458
We'll see about that.

24:54.375 --> 24:56.083
Let's see what you got old man.

25:25.333 --> 25:26.458
Ladies first.

25:38.875 --> 25:40.041
Alright,

25:40.042 --> 25:41.167
you're fast.

25:42.625 --> 25:43.750
Come on.

25:46.958 --> 25:49.874
Looks like old man needs a
knee replacement again huh?

25:49.875 --> 25:50.957
I'm just warming up.

25:50.958 --> 25:51.958
Uh huh.

25:51.959 --> 25:53.279
Come on you
little tramp let's go.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.583
Need help up, old woman?

26:03.958 --> 26:05.500
Oh hell no!

26:25.708 --> 26:27.000
Are we done?

26:32.833 --> 26:34.208
Not a chance.

27:20.875 --> 27:22.999
No Paco, you have
to keep it steady.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.208
Smooth lines, straight.

27:24.583 --> 27:25.333
This.

27:25.333 --> 27:26.333
See watch, watch me.

27:27.333 --> 27:28.333
Thrust,

27:28.333 --> 27:28.958
rake.

27:29.208 --> 27:30.208
Thrust,

27:30.208 --> 27:30.958
rake.

27:30.958 --> 27:31.958
Thrust,

27:31.958 --> 27:32.542
rake.

27:32.543 --> 27:34.333
Thrust it forward, pull it back.

27:34.750 --> 27:35.750
Smooth strokes.

27:36.042 --> 27:37.042
Thrust,

27:37.500 --> 27:38.500
back.

27:39.083 --> 27:40.083
Be one with the rake.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.875
Yes stupid!

27:45.250 --> 27:46.874
Thrust, rake.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.416
Thrust, rake.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.250
Thrust.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.000
It's like making
whoopie to the forest.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.083
Come on, faster!

27:56.500 --> 27:57.582
Faster Paco!

27:57.583 --> 27:58.583
Faster!

28:00.083 --> 28:01.083
Look at them,

28:01.708 --> 28:02.708
raking the forest.

28:03.583 --> 28:04.832
Who do they think they are

28:04.833 --> 28:06.583
stealing jobs from
American citizens?

28:07.333 --> 28:08.875
They're not stealing jobs,

28:09.208 --> 28:11.288
they're doing work that
nobody else here wants to do.

28:11.708 --> 28:13.750
Work that needs to be
done to keep our forests safe.

28:15.250 --> 28:18.624
At least the Raking Work Visa Program gives
them an opportunity to come here legally

28:18.625 --> 28:19.375
Yeah,

28:19.376 --> 28:20.750
raking in American dough.

28:21.125 --> 28:23.417
Throwing it back over
the wall to their compadres.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.749
Financing human trafficking,

28:25.750 --> 28:26.750
drugs,

28:27.000 --> 28:30.250
and those damn delicious
Takis you buy at the dollar
store.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.750
Should have made
the wall 10 times bigger.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.000
A lot of good that wall did.

28:36.500 --> 28:39.500
One wall is not gonna stop
millions of people from seeking
a better life.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.832
Maybe you're right.

28:44.833 --> 28:45.833
But 2 walls,

28:46.208 --> 28:47.208
that's sure to stop them.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.124
And now that Donalds'
in his 2nd term,

28:50.125 --> 28:52.375
hopefully he'll build that
2nd wall like he promised.

28:52.833 --> 28:53.833
2 walls?

28:54.125 --> 28:55.125
And then what?

28:56.208 --> 28:57.208
2 walls,

28:57.542 --> 28:58.749
and in between them,

28:58.750 --> 28:59.750
a giant mote.

29:00.250 --> 29:00.917
And we'll fill it with...

29:00.917 --> 29:01.917
What?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Liberal tears?

29:03.500 --> 29:04.542
Melted snowflakes?

29:05.333 --> 29:06.208
No.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.208
Water stupid.

29:08.833 --> 29:11.208
He'll build the biggest mote
the world has ever seen.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.250
It'll be huge.

29:15.083 --> 29:18.500
By the time the illegals
climb over the first wall,

29:23.500 --> 29:24.874
Paco, we have to swim across!

29:24.875 --> 29:25.875
Let's go!

29:26.000 --> 29:28.875
Oh asshole, I'm not
a good swimmer Jose!

29:34.333 --> 29:37.875
And swim through the
crocodile infested waters,

29:44.542 --> 29:46.207
Paco!!!

29:46.208 --> 29:49.583
Jose!!!

29:58.083 --> 30:00.375
And get over to the 2nd wall,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.375
they'll be too slippery
and wet to climb it.

30:06.167 --> 30:08.083
They'll lay there in exhaustion

30:08.375 --> 30:09.375
too tired

30:09.500 --> 30:10.500
and just give up.

30:20.375 --> 30:21.625
Oh fuck...

30:24.500 --> 30:25.582
Yeah, yeah.

30:25.583 --> 30:26.583
2 walls.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.374
I suppose he's gonna
make Hillary pay for it right?

30:29.375 --> 30:30.375
Damn straight she will.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.670
As soon as the extradite
her ass from California.

30:33.917 --> 30:36.250
Damn sactuary state bullshit.

30:37.250 --> 30:38.450
At least you're retiring soon.

30:39.083 --> 30:42.483
You'll have better things to
do with your time than worry
about forests and immigrants.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.541
Maybe you can move
back to California?

30:44.542 --> 30:45.542
Settle down on the coast?

30:46.250 --> 30:49.374
There's no chance in hell
I'm going back to Comi-fornia.

30:49.375 --> 30:49.875
Why?

30:50.333 --> 30:51.708
So that Governor Grohl

30:52.083 --> 30:54.958
can take half of my retirement
on the taxes he just raised?

30:55.833 --> 30:57.208
There goes my hero.

30:58.250 --> 30:59.583
He took my straws,

30:59.875 --> 31:01.082
my knives,

31:01.083 --> 31:02.083
my guns,

31:02.333 --> 31:03.500
the urinals!

31:04.625 --> 31:07.500
How do you ban a man
from standing to take a leak?

31:10.375 --> 31:12.792
What kind of man
sits down to pee?

31:13.375 --> 31:14.375
I won't do it.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.750
I'll go out and piss right
in front of my house.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.749
So you would rather
stand up to pee,

31:18.750 --> 31:21.000
than stand up for
bathroom gender equality?

31:21.458 --> 31:27.082
I would rather stand in line and
pay a $1.50 to eat my dick off a
bun,

31:27.083 --> 31:30.124
wash it down with
16 ounces of flat piss.

31:30.125 --> 31:31.458
With free refills.

31:32.333 --> 31:33.958
Damn I miss Costco.

31:34.833 --> 31:35.833
Costco?

31:36.458 --> 31:37.458
What's that?

31:37.500 --> 31:38.999
The only place this
side of the border

31:39.000 --> 31:41.833
where you can buy beautiful
bulk Takis by the big bag.

31:42.583 --> 31:44.000
Less than 2 hours
until the Purge,

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
you going out tonight?

31:46.542 --> 31:47.542
No.

31:47.750 --> 31:48.750
Family's coming over.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Having dinner.

31:50.750 --> 31:53.207
Got to make sure
everybody stays safe tonight.

31:53.208 --> 31:54.333
How about you?

31:54.667 --> 31:55.667
Uh...

31:56.000 --> 31:58.160
Some friends of mine are
coming over and picking me up.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.353
You know, we've got a list of
assholes we're gonna visit
tonight.

32:02.333 --> 32:03.833
So your house pretty secure?

32:04.167 --> 32:05.499
Reinforced windows?

32:05.500 --> 32:06.833
Security camers installed?

32:07.083 --> 32:08.166
No...

32:08.167 --> 32:09.374
Haven't got around to it yet.

32:09.375 --> 32:10.083
Ha...

32:10.083 --> 32:10.875
Nice!

32:10.875 --> 32:11.875
Excuse me?

32:11.875 --> 32:12.875
Uh...

32:13.708 --> 32:15.207

32:15.208 --> 32:16.333

32:36.500 --> 32:38.250
End of the road friends!

32:50.250 --> 32:51.000

33:01.042 --> 33:02.042
I'm serious here.

33:02.043 --> 33:03.832
I've got other places to be.

33:03.833 --> 33:04.708
Let's go.

33:04.709 --> 33:05.874
That's it.

33:05.875 --> 33:06.708
Like that.

33:06.709 --> 33:07.958
Spread your legs a little bit.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.250
There we go.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.500
Hurry up!

33:10.667 --> 33:11.667
Come on.

33:13.042 --> 33:14.542
There we go...

33:15.000 --> 33:16.083
That's good.

33:16.417 --> 33:18.500
Stay right there, I've
gotta go get a ladder.

33:18.750 --> 33:19.750
But I'll be right back.

33:34.083 --> 33:35.125
I got your ladder!

33:36.208 --> 33:37.832
You guys miss me?

33:37.833 --> 33:40.625
You guys get to go home.

33:45.875 --> 33:46.957
Now...

33:46.958 --> 33:48.457
By executive order

33:48.458 --> 33:50.249
of The United States of America

33:50.250 --> 33:53.166
and to the Republic
for which it stands,

33:53.167 --> 33:57.249
I hereby am returning
you to your nattive territory.

33:57.250 --> 33:59.624
Now you all are gonna
climb up this ladder

33:59.625 --> 34:02.624
up over the wall and back to
the country from which you came

34:02.625 --> 34:04.499
and never return

34:04.500 --> 34:06.875
so help me baby Jesus.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.708
I'm gonna go talk to my
colleagues over there...

34:10.958 --> 34:12.707
Excuse me, companions...

34:12.708 --> 34:13.874
And when I return,

34:13.875 --> 34:15.999
Ya'll are gonna be vaminosed.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000

34:19.875 --> 34:22.458
Okay, let me try to...

34:22.958 --> 34:25.707
Yo el turn-o-round-o...

34:25.708 --> 34:26.500

34:26.501 --> 34:28.457

34:28.458 --> 34:30.000

34:31.375 --> 34:32.999
very fast!!!

34:33.000 --> 34:34.875
Understand?

34:36.375 --> 34:37.125
Yes.

34:37.126 --> 34:39.499
Ah!!!! Very Excellent!!!

34:39.500 --> 34:40.999
Thank you very much

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
for respecting my authorities.

34:43.333 --> 34:44.582
Nice try ya'll,

34:44.583 --> 34:46.333
but not on my watch...

34:56.667 --> 34:58.207
It's a sign from God.

34:58.208 --> 34:59.583
It's a ladder.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Hello.

35:16.001 --> 35:17.582
What are you doing?

35:17.583 --> 35:18.874
You're gonna get caught.

35:18.875 --> 35:20.375
They're gonna deport you.

35:20.667 --> 35:21.583
No.

35:21.584 --> 35:23.499
There's nothing that
can stop me now.

35:23.500 --> 35:27.208
I've traveled over 4000
miles to fulfil my destiny.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.374
Your desitiny?

35:29.375 --> 35:30.874
Wait, who are you?

35:30.875 --> 35:33.082
My name is Pedro
Andreas Cavalera.

35:33.083 --> 35:35.749
And since I was a young
boy in Brazil, I prayed...

35:35.750 --> 35:37.582
that one day...

35:37.583 --> 35:39.541
I would come to America...

35:39.542 --> 35:41.082
and dance on Broadway...

35:41.083 --> 35:42.874
We came here
looking for a better life.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.207
I had a job...

35:44.208 --> 35:45.541
A home...

35:45.542 --> 35:47.041
But they keep sending us back.

35:47.042 --> 35:48.707
Oh really?

35:48.708 --> 35:50.833
The legal way
just takes to long.

35:51.042 --> 35:52.832
We wouldn't survive.

35:52.833 --> 35:55.082
Then why are you
just standing here?

35:55.083 --> 35:56.749
Seize the moment and...

35:56.750 --> 35:58.749
Never give up!

35:58.750 --> 35:59.874
Follow your dreams.

35:59.875 --> 36:00.917
See you later!!!

36:05.417 --> 36:06.582
What are we waiting for?

36:06.583 --> 36:08.375
Follow the rainbow!

36:26.500 --> 36:29.083
Sounds like somebody's
got a sweet ride.

37:37.333 --> 37:38.333
You know what I'm
saying? Two fingers.

37:38.333 --> 37:38.875
Two fingers.

37:38.875 --> 37:39.708
Evening Bill.

37:39.708 --> 37:40.500
Aidan.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.333
Hey Daryl.

37:41.333 --> 37:42.167
Daryl.

37:42.167 --> 37:43.000
How's it going?

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Gum?

37:44.208 --> 37:45.208
Got my own.

37:46.208 --> 37:47.288
What's the good word Daryl?

37:47.875 --> 37:49.666
Just another glorious day

37:49.667 --> 37:51.499
protecting our sovereign nation

37:51.500 --> 37:53.707
from those who would
trespass against it.

37:53.708 --> 37:55.583
Like those 2 yahoos...

37:58.833 --> 38:00.207
Look at them...

38:00.208 --> 38:01.582
Putos...

38:01.583 --> 38:03.166
Standing around doing
nothing laughing at us

38:03.167 --> 38:05.500
while we work hard to
become American citizens.

38:06.208 --> 38:07.500
Callete Jose.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.749
Don't look them in the eye.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.000
They don't like it when
you look them in the eye.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.207
You doing anything tonight?

38:14.208 --> 38:15.249
You know...

38:15.250 --> 38:16.250
For the purge?

38:16.667 --> 38:17.874
I'll probably just

38:17.875 --> 38:19.874
stay home, watch some TV,

38:19.875 --> 38:21.000
until everything is over.

38:22.583 --> 38:26.999
I'm not very big on the whole
murder, violence, hunting for
sport thing.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.541
I prefer catch and release.

38:28.542 --> 38:29.875
Like when I go fishing.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.083
You should stay at Bill's place.

38:33.000 --> 38:33.833
You know,

38:33.834 --> 38:35.458
safety in numbers.

38:36.708 --> 38:38.332
You're more than welcome.

38:38.333 --> 38:39.707
Just gonna have the family over,

38:39.708 --> 38:40.999
have a few beers,

38:41.000 --> 38:42.582
catch the Apprentice premiere.

38:42.583 --> 38:44.166
Do you like Takis?

38:44.167 --> 38:45.374
You sure Bill?

38:45.375 --> 38:46.874
I don't wanna intrude.

38:46.875 --> 38:49.166
No, no. Besides it's...

38:49.167 --> 38:51.567
probably the only way you're
gonna make it through the night.

38:52.083 --> 38:54.374
I got tons of locks on my doors.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.541
Plus bars on my windows.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.082
That is some good information.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.083
Thanks for that.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.250
I'll take you up on it Bill.

39:02.083 --> 39:03.916
You're more than welcome.

39:03.917 --> 39:05.499
Even though you're...

39:05.500 --> 39:06.582
ICE.

39:06.583 --> 39:07.500
Ha!

39:07.501 --> 39:08.625
Good one!

39:09.333 --> 39:10.707
It's a good idea Daryl.

39:10.708 --> 39:12.832
It'll save us a lot of time
having
you guys all in the same place.

39:12.833 --> 39:13.833
Excuse me?

39:14.083 --> 39:15.375
What'd you say boy?

39:15.833 --> 39:16.583
Oh...

39:16.584 --> 39:18.082
You guys would
have fun together.

39:18.083 --> 39:19.582
Do you think we're gonna like,

39:19.583 --> 39:21.582
piss and cross
streams or something?

39:21.583 --> 39:22.458
No.

39:22.459 --> 39:23.499
You guys are friendly.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.417
Bro...

39:24.418 --> 39:25.666
ICE...

39:25.667 --> 39:26.667
ICE.

39:27.417 --> 39:28.417
And FIRE.

39:28.418 --> 39:29.749
They don't mix.

39:29.750 --> 39:30.874
They do!

39:30.875 --> 39:31.417
Yeah they do.

39:31.417 --> 39:32.417
No.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.624
It's like the Yin and the Yang.

39:34.625 --> 39:35.542
FIRE...

39:35.542 --> 39:36.500
ICE!

39:36.501 --> 39:37.874
I'm just messing with you Bill.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.624
I've seen the movie
Ghost Busters.

39:39.625 --> 39:40.832
Everybody knows

39:40.833 --> 39:42.625
you don't cross streams.

39:43.333 --> 39:45.249
Except for this guy apparently.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.125
Okay.

39:46.126 --> 39:47.624
So I'm into crossing streams...

39:47.625 --> 39:49.583
What's the big deal?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.457
It's 2025!

39:51.458 --> 39:52.458
Whatever!

39:52.583 --> 39:53.707
You millennial.

39:53.708 --> 39:55.125
Fuckin millennials.

39:59.625 --> 40:00.625
Hey!

40:01.208 --> 40:03.726
Quit eyeballing me like you're
trying to cross streams. Okay
bro?

40:03.750 --> 40:04.625
Which one's eyeballing you?

40:04.626 --> 40:06.041
The one on the left.

40:06.042 --> 40:07.125
Hey!

40:07.542 --> 40:08.750
Quit looking at me!

40:09.667 --> 40:10.625
Yeah...

40:10.626 --> 40:12.250
That's me and your mom later.

40:14.083 --> 40:16.000
Hey, take it easy on them guys.

40:16.333 --> 40:17.833
What the hell's wrong with you?

40:18.083 --> 40:19.582
He's fucking catch and release.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.499
Oh, totally catch and release.

40:21.500 --> 40:25.500
Their mothers are probably
really nice people and make
great tostadas.

40:25.875 --> 40:26.667
Look Daryl,

40:26.668 --> 40:28.707
just try to be at my
place around 6:30.

40:28.708 --> 40:29.500
Fine.

40:29.501 --> 40:30.999
6:30 it is.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.208
Don't be late!

40:32.583 --> 40:33.833
Speaking of late...

40:35.708 --> 40:36.750
Time to wrap it up.

40:38.167 --> 40:39.708
Back to your home.

40:40.208 --> 40:42.083
The hour of the
Purge is upon us.

41:03.083 --> 41:06.083
I heard you guys had a
pretty big bust yesterday.

41:08.875 --> 41:11.875
Oh yeah, what'd you hear?

41:12.583 --> 41:15.375
Just that you caught
a major Cartel leader.

41:15.583 --> 41:17.667
Brought in a big
haul of narcotics.

41:18.375 --> 41:21.000
Scored a big chunk of
change on top of that.

41:21.708 --> 41:24.207
Like 1.4 million
dollars or something?

41:24.208 --> 41:26.333
Or something.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.375
1.4 million.

41:32.250 --> 41:34.249
I could live large off of that.

41:34.250 --> 41:35.875
I bet you could.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.582
Two more weeks.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.499
All you gotta do is
survive tonight and...

41:40.500 --> 41:42.249
smooth sailing.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.250
That's my plan.

41:44.667 --> 41:45.667
Hey...

41:45.668 --> 41:46.874
Take a right up
here at the light.

41:46.875 --> 41:49.083
I need to stop by
the dollar store.

41:54.208 --> 41:56.208
I'll be right back.

42:19.875 --> 42:20.750
Come on.

42:20.751 --> 42:22.250
Come get a bite.

42:23.125 --> 42:24.167
Here.

42:25.667 --> 42:26.999
How about you?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Come on.

42:34.458 --> 42:36.458
I'm real sorry I
have to do this to ya.

42:39.125 --> 42:41.833
But needs must
when the devil drives.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.000
Come on, play nice!

43:05.500 --> 43:08.082
Alright girls, you're
in for the night.

43:08.083 --> 43:09.207
Don't be breaking out.

43:09.208 --> 43:11.333
It's all bad on this
side of the fence.

43:12.167 --> 43:13.833
Hope to see you in the morning.

43:34.875 --> 43:37.208
Weren't you expecting a
friend to show up here already?

43:37.583 --> 43:39.083
He'll be along in a bit.

43:39.875 --> 43:41.374
He'd better hurry up!

43:41.375 --> 43:44.166
Don't wanna be caught passing
through town before it's too
late.

43:44.167 --> 43:45.374
No worries.

43:45.375 --> 43:46.855
We don't get many
Purgers up this way.

43:47.667 --> 43:50.207
Got a fence around
the entire property.

43:50.208 --> 43:53.041
Cars can't get through
without a gate code.

43:53.042 --> 43:54.582
Besides...

43:54.583 --> 43:56.582
It's good for Halloween too.

43:56.583 --> 43:58.583
None of those
pesky trick or treaters.

43:59.375 --> 44:00.375
True story.

44:00.708 --> 44:03.708
I'll give him a call and make
sure he didn't get fucking lost.

44:12.958 --> 44:14.958
Come on stupid pump.

44:16.750 --> 44:18.583
Why does it have to be so slow?

44:27.250 --> 44:28.250
Hello?

44:28.375 --> 44:29.375
Hey!

44:29.500 --> 44:30.500
You still on your way?

44:30.542 --> 44:31.250
Yeah.

44:31.500 --> 44:32.375
I...

44:32.376 --> 44:34.416
just stopped to get
some gas real quick.

44:34.417 --> 44:35.750
I'm just around the corner.

44:36.583 --> 44:37.750
Only minutes left.

44:38.083 --> 44:40.249
I'm trying to hurry but this...

44:40.250 --> 44:43.500
pump is moving slower than
a snail wiping it's ass I swear.

44:43.833 --> 44:45.000
Move your ass bro.

44:45.250 --> 44:46.500
Love you too, bye...

44:55.750 --> 44:57.208
Come on stupid pump.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.625
I hate everything about
this god damn pump.

45:23.375 --> 45:24.708
Come on...

45:29.708 --> 45:30.958
No... come on.

45:33.125 --> 45:34.125
Come on!!!

45:36.125 --> 45:37.125
Hey yo!

45:37.126 --> 45:38.166
You alright?

45:38.167 --> 45:39.999
You need some help?

45:40.000 --> 45:41.624
I don't speak English!

45:41.625 --> 45:42.999
Let me give you a hand.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.999
You know it's not
safe to be here.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.374
Just pop open the hood and
we'll take a look at the engine.

45:47.375 --> 45:48.375
Come on!

45:48.583 --> 45:50.583
Come on baby, you got this.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.999
Woo, yeah!!!

45:54.000 --> 45:55.583
See ya sucker!!!

45:59.500 --> 46:01.875
I'm only trying to help!

46:08.208 --> 46:09.582
Relax everybody.

46:09.583 --> 46:11.000
It's probably just Daryl.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.083
Daryl, you son of a bitch!

46:30.000 --> 46:32.083
That's a hell of a
grip you got there Bill.

46:32.375 --> 46:34.708
What, ICE got you
pushing too many pencils?

46:35.875 --> 46:37.499
Just fucking with ya.

46:37.500 --> 46:38.780
Cuttin' it a bit
close aren't ya?

46:39.042 --> 46:41.250
Had some car trouble
back at the gas station.

46:41.875 --> 46:43.375
Can you just let me in already?

46:44.542 --> 46:45.542
Come on in.

46:46.042 --> 46:49.042
Thanks. I swear somebody was
ready to knock me off at that
gas station.

46:49.375 --> 46:51.082
But thanks to sweet baby Jesus,

46:51.083 --> 46:52.166
I made it out.

46:52.167 --> 46:53.583
Family is in the living room.

46:56.708 --> 46:58.541
Hey everybody, this is Daryl.

46:58.542 --> 47:00.375
Daryl works with me
at Homeland Security.

47:00.708 --> 47:02.749
Hi I'm Daryl, pleased
to meet you all.

47:02.750 --> 47:05.249
Hi Daryl, I'm
Bill's sister Stacey.

47:05.250 --> 47:07.041
This is my husband Tom.

47:07.042 --> 47:08.875
Howdy Daryl,
pleased to meet you.

47:10.250 --> 47:12.000
The pleasures all mine...

47:14.083 --> 47:15.667
And my daughter Jenna.

47:16.875 --> 47:17.916
Hello.

47:17.917 --> 47:19.042
Hi.

47:20.250 --> 47:21.875
My son Brian.

47:22.750 --> 47:24.166
How's it going my man?

47:24.167 --> 47:24.667
Hey.

47:24.667 --> 47:25.375
Brian!

47:25.667 --> 47:26.667
Brian!

47:27.250 --> 47:29.875
Don't be rude, say
hello to our guest.

47:30.375 --> 47:31.375
Sup man!

47:31.833 --> 47:32.833
Sup!

47:33.333 --> 47:35.083
And Grandma Ruth.

47:35.333 --> 47:37.124
Nice to meet you Darren.

47:37.125 --> 47:38.957
It's actually Daryl ma'am.

47:38.958 --> 47:39.708
Daryl...

47:39.709 --> 47:41.332
Isn't that a girls name?

47:41.333 --> 47:43.249
Uh... I don't believe so.

47:43.250 --> 47:45.375
Like that movie,
that murmaid movie.

47:45.750 --> 47:47.249
Oh love that one!

47:47.250 --> 47:48.500
Daryl Hannah.

47:48.750 --> 47:52.499
Well yeah, but there's plenty
of manly men out there with the
name Daryl too.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.874
Like you got what, uh...

47:53.875 --> 47:56.041
Daryl Stawberry who
used to play on the Mets.

47:56.042 --> 47:57.166
Daryl Hall.

47:57.167 --> 47:58.416
Daryl Hammond.

47:58.417 --> 47:59.874
Well that's okay.

47:59.875 --> 48:02.125
Whatever makes
you feel better about it.

48:03.750 --> 48:04.708
Okay.

48:04.708 --> 48:05.708
Well...

48:06.083 --> 48:07.374
It was nice to meet you all.

48:07.375 --> 48:08.958
Uhh, just want to say,

48:09.333 --> 48:11.707
thanks for allowing me
to stay with you tonight.

48:11.708 --> 48:13.708
It really means alot.

48:14.083 --> 48:14.750
Hey uh...

48:14.750 --> 48:15.583
Sorry about that.

48:15.584 --> 48:17.457
I didn't mean to be
rude earlier or anything.

48:17.458 --> 48:19.978
I was just Snatch Chatting with
this chick that liked my
profile.

48:20.333 --> 48:22.125
Snatch Chat huh?

48:22.583 --> 48:25.041
Sounds like a mature
site for a boy your age.

48:25.042 --> 48:29.374
Uh no, Snatch Chat is just
a social site that you like
upload selfies...

48:29.375 --> 48:33.041
and people can like them
or message you if you both click
like on each other.

48:33.042 --> 48:34.582
They call it Snatching.

48:34.583 --> 48:35.583
Snatching!

48:35.583 --> 48:36.208
Mmm hmm.

48:36.209 --> 48:37.582
I got you, my bad.

48:37.583 --> 48:40.332
I just got this new app called
Timber, have you heard of it?

48:40.333 --> 48:41.749
No...

48:41.750 --> 48:46.332
Well, its basically designed
for the ladies so that only men
they've liked...

48:46.333 --> 48:47.499
can message them.

48:47.500 --> 48:50.499
I only installed the app to
make sure my profile is working.

48:50.500 --> 48:52.583
I haven't found
the one just yet.

48:53.083 --> 48:54.208
Basically...

48:55.083 --> 48:56.666
Get this out here...

48:56.667 --> 48:59.083
You just open the app.

49:00.583 --> 49:02.374
Okay, and then when
you get into here,

49:02.375 --> 49:04.083
you click Find Wood.

49:05.375 --> 49:09.208
And these are called your
Wood Piles and your gonna scroll
through these.

49:12.375 --> 49:13.208
And...

49:13.209 --> 49:15.042
when you see
something you like...

49:15.875 --> 49:17.249
then you click on them.

49:17.250 --> 49:20.041
Obviously this guy you
would just click Cut 'Em Loose.

49:20.042 --> 49:23.226
That gets them out of your
Wood Pile but if you like what
you see you click Get Some!

49:23.250 --> 49:25.667
Timber!!!

49:26.083 --> 49:27.749
Oh shit...

49:27.750 --> 49:28.750
Umm...

49:28.751 --> 49:31.018
Do you see a cancle button
on here? I didn't mean to do
that.

49:31.042 --> 49:31.667
No...

49:31.667 --> 49:32.250
Uh oh...

49:32.251 --> 49:33.375
I don't see one...

49:34.000 --> 49:35.874
I'm not interested in dudes.

49:35.875 --> 49:37.083
You've got wood!

49:37.375 --> 49:38.000
Uh oh!

49:38.375 --> 49:40.375
There's something
in my Wood Pile.

49:41.167 --> 49:41.708
Oh!!!

49:41.709 --> 49:44.042
Oh sweet Jesus...

49:46.208 --> 49:47.208
Yep...

49:47.458 --> 49:48.875
That's a dick pic...

49:49.750 --> 49:52.749
When you're done looking at
Dicks, would you like a beer?

49:52.750 --> 49:54.749
Umm, no thanks.
I'm alergic to gluten.

49:54.750 --> 49:57.082
We have Angry
Apple for the ladies.

49:57.083 --> 49:58.167
Uh, sure.

50:11.875 --> 50:13.874
I don't know if I should
be drinking tonight.

50:13.875 --> 50:15.624
Should probably
be on full alert.

50:15.625 --> 50:17.124
Don't be a pussy.

50:17.125 --> 50:18.833
1 drink ain't gonna kill ya.

50:20.458 --> 50:23.208
It's not the drink
I'm affraid of.

50:23.708 --> 50:25.332
It's what's out there tonight.

50:25.333 --> 50:26.958
Ahh, let 'em come.

50:27.458 --> 50:29.749
I have special door
prizes for any uh...

50:29.750 --> 50:31.125
unwelcome guests.

50:33.250 --> 50:35.249
Here, try some Takis.

50:35.250 --> 50:36.874
They're delicious!

50:36.875 --> 50:39.124
Sure, I can try one.

50:39.125 --> 50:41.042
Never had these before.

50:51.500 --> 50:52.957
Now we're having fun.

50:52.958 --> 50:54.833
Fucking delicious ain't they?

50:57.208 --> 50:58.582
So Daryl...

50:58.583 --> 51:00.375
Do you work for FIRE as well?

51:01.333 --> 51:04.333
No, I work for Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.874
Ah, so like the
people I see on the TV

51:08.875 --> 51:12.708
that are ripping apart
families and separating children
from their parents?

51:13.250 --> 51:14.874
I've done no such thing.

51:14.875 --> 51:17.999
Why, just today, I sent an
entire family back to Mexico.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.416
Parents and children together.

51:20.417 --> 51:22.707
I know it might
say ICE on my vest,

51:22.708 --> 51:23.832
but my heart,

51:23.833 --> 51:25.583
is warm in my chest.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.207
Awe!

51:27.208 --> 51:28.500
Well,

51:28.708 --> 51:31.707
that gives me some faith
that there's good people working
in our Government.

51:31.708 --> 51:34.207
I mean, everybody deserves
a fair shake at life right?

51:34.208 --> 51:35.208
They do.

51:35.209 --> 51:38.082
And now there's new ways for
them to come over here legally.

51:38.083 --> 51:41.083
That's why the
President created FIRE.

51:41.333 --> 51:42.666
Wait a second...

51:42.667 --> 51:44.082
Let me get this straight...

51:44.083 --> 51:47.332
Forrest and Immigration
Raking Enforcement?

51:47.333 --> 51:49.249
FIRE!

51:49.250 --> 51:50.749
And...

51:50.750 --> 51:52.582
Immigration and
Customs Enforcement?

51:52.583 --> 51:53.125
ICE!

51:53.126 --> 51:54.625
Yes ma'am!

51:56.875 --> 51:58.707
FIRE and ICE?

51:58.708 --> 51:59.999
Who comes up with this sh..

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Shh!!!

52:01.708 --> 52:02.874
It's startin'.

52:02.875 --> 52:05.207
Quiet everybody!

52:05.208 --> 52:06.874
This is not a test.

52:06.875 --> 52:09.375
This is the Emergency
Broadcast System.

52:22.083 --> 52:23.999
After the siren, all
crime, including murder, will be
legal for 12 hours.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.541
All emergency services
will beunavailable until
tomorrow morning at 7am when

52:28.542 --> 52:31.541
the second siren
concludes the Purge.

52:31.542 --> 52:33.333
May God be with you.

53:05.083 --> 53:06.583
That's enough of that already.

53:11.708 --> 53:12.875
Apprentice.

53:15.958 --> 53:17.625
Ooh I love this show!

53:41.958 --> 53:43.582
Alright, are we live?

53:43.583 --> 53:45.832
Oh it's, it's pre-recorded?

53:45.833 --> 53:46.625
Alright, whatever!

53:46.626 --> 53:52.332
Welcome to the first episode
of the Apprentice 2025.

53:52.333 --> 53:53.874
Before we get started,

53:53.875 --> 53:56.332
I just wanted to give a
big shout out to Putin...

53:56.333 --> 53:57.791
For nominating me...

53:57.792 --> 53:59.999
for the Pee-Pee Challenge.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.874
We're going to be doing that
a little bit later this evening.

54:02.875 --> 54:05.124
Nobody does the
Pee-Pee Challenge...

54:05.125 --> 54:06.166
like I do.

54:06.167 --> 54:06.917
Okay.

54:06.917 --> 54:07.750
Nobody!

54:07.751 --> 54:10.207
It's going to be huge!

54:10.208 --> 54:12.374
Very frothy!

54:12.375 --> 54:13.000
Lastly...

54:13.001 --> 54:14.332
It's a special night!

54:14.333 --> 54:17.332
The return of the annual Purge.

54:17.333 --> 54:19.499
Everybody have a great time.

54:19.500 --> 54:20.000
Okay?

54:20.001 --> 54:22.249
I'll be watching via
Space Force satellite

54:22.250 --> 54:24.583
at Mar-a-Lago's clubhouse.

54:24.833 --> 54:25.583
Now...

54:25.584 --> 54:30.082
I'm starting a new business
right here in my city, New York.

54:30.083 --> 54:34.499
We're going to take over
the world of intimate apparel.

54:34.500 --> 54:37.499
Nobody knows
intimate apparel like I do.

54:37.500 --> 54:38.999
I present to you...

54:39.000 --> 54:41.083
Donjerie!

54:52.500 --> 54:57.374
Donjerie will be the finest
clothing a woman can adorne.

54:57.375 --> 54:59.249
Each one of you have one week

54:59.250 --> 55:03.874
to design a completely
new line of bras and panties

55:03.875 --> 55:07.374
unlike anything the fashion
industry has ever seen.

55:07.375 --> 55:09.000
Now, get to work!

55:09.542 --> 55:11.000
What the fuck is that?

55:11.375 --> 55:13.041
It's a fucking handle grip where
you can grab them by the...

55:13.042 --> 55:15.082
What the fuck do you
need a handle grip for?

55:15.083 --> 55:17.041
If it's hanging there and
you grab them by the pussy...

55:17.042 --> 55:18.499
What do you need a handle...?

55:18.500 --> 55:19.708
Why wouldn't you need it?

55:20.458 --> 55:22.166
It's fucking genious!

55:22.167 --> 55:24.666
And what is this? Does
she have 4 nipples?

55:24.667 --> 55:26.082
Do you know?

55:26.083 --> 55:27.042
8 nipples!

55:27.043 --> 55:28.666
Have you ever even seen a woman?

55:28.667 --> 55:29.375
Naked?

55:29.375 --> 55:30.250
Fuck... you!!!

55:30.251 --> 55:32.249
They're both fucking idiots!

55:32.250 --> 55:35.667
They wouldn't know a good
design from a hole in their ass!

55:36.000 --> 55:37.500
I'm the next Apprentice.

55:37.917 --> 55:39.249
Focus on the cannons.

55:39.250 --> 55:40.749
Look at these things.

55:40.750 --> 55:41.750
Gorgeous!

55:41.751 --> 55:43.374
8 nipples, we're good.

55:43.375 --> 55:45.749
When you come down here
and you yank on that shit,

55:45.750 --> 55:47.041
we're good!!!

55:47.042 --> 55:48.416
Why are we gonna
yank on that shit???

55:48.417 --> 55:51.499
Everybody knows, every girl
wants to be yanked by the pussy.

55:51.500 --> 55:52.707
I don't want to be
yanked by the pussy!

55:52.708 --> 55:54.207
Nobody ever wants to
be yanked by the pussy!

55:54.208 --> 55:55.499
Do you wanna be
yanked by the dick?

55:55.500 --> 55:56.832
I want to be yanking pussy!!!

55:56.833 --> 55:58.207
You want to be
yanked by the pussy?

55:58.208 --> 55:58.833
Yes...

55:58.833 --> 55:59.833
I don't have... maybe...

55:59.833 --> 56:00.583
There it is.

56:00.583 --> 56:01.583
Shit!

56:03.042 --> 56:06.250
So Daryl, you work for uh,
Homeland Security too huh?

56:06.542 --> 56:07.625
What agency?

56:08.125 --> 56:09.499
I'm with the...

56:09.500 --> 56:11.499
U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement.

56:11.500 --> 56:12.875
Commonly known as ICE.

56:13.125 --> 56:15.875
Come again? You gotta
talk into my good ear.

56:16.250 --> 56:17.999
God dad, he just went over this!

56:18.000 --> 56:18.625
Listen!

56:18.875 --> 56:20.624
Dad can't hear shit...

56:20.625 --> 56:21.625
Brian!

56:21.667 --> 56:22.750
Language!!

56:23.125 --> 56:26.124
Someone threw a grenade
right next to his tent when he
was in Vietnam.

56:26.125 --> 56:29.124
Exploded right by him and
now he's mostly deaf in one ear.

56:29.125 --> 56:31.083
Shrapnel tore right
through my pillow.

56:31.333 --> 56:32.958
I'm lucky to be alive!

56:34.083 --> 56:36.707
So Daryl, have you heard
anything
about the new Space Force?

56:36.708 --> 56:38.250
Do you really get
to go into space?

56:39.208 --> 56:42.374
Nah, that will likely be a
branch of the U.S. military.

56:42.375 --> 56:45.958
Unless of course we have
to deal with illegal aliens...

56:46.417 --> 56:47.417
Wait, for real?

56:48.042 --> 56:48.667
Like...

56:48.668 --> 56:50.624
do aliens really exist??

56:50.625 --> 56:52.874
It was a joke dillhole!

56:52.875 --> 56:53.875
Jen!!!

56:53.876 --> 56:56.125
Be nice to your brother!

56:56.833 --> 56:58.374
Hey Brian!

56:58.375 --> 57:00.499
You should come do a
ride along with me sometime.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.666
See what it takes to
keep our borders secure.

57:02.667 --> 57:03.333
Really?

57:03.334 --> 57:04.875
I wouldn't mind a ride along...

57:05.833 --> 57:08.833
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

57:09.708 --> 57:12.083
Mom, can I go on a ride
along with Daryl please?

57:12.500 --> 57:14.332
That sounds fine honey.

57:14.333 --> 57:18.000
Just make sure finish
your homework first and you're
back in time for supper.

57:20.500 --> 57:25.000
You know, our immigration
policy is a complete joke...

57:25.333 --> 57:26.374
Speaking of which...

57:26.375 --> 57:28.541
Oh God, here we go again...

57:28.542 --> 57:31.749
You ever hear the one about
the Border Patrol agent...

57:31.750 --> 57:34.999
who catches an illegal
immigrant and says...

57:35.000 --> 57:40.707
I'll let you stay in the
U.S.A. if you can say 3 english
words in 1 sentance?

57:40.708 --> 57:42.666
No, can't say I have.

57:42.667 --> 57:45.667
The Border Patrol
thinks to him self uh...

57:46.083 --> 57:49.083
I'm gonna make this
really hard for him.

57:49.500 --> 57:52.499
The 3 english words you
gotta say in 1 sentance...

57:52.500 --> 57:55.875
are green, pink and yellow.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.582
Well the Mexican guy says...

57:58.583 --> 58:00.207
Oh yes sir!

58:00.208 --> 58:01.999
And starts thinking about it.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.041
A couple of minutes later...

58:04.042 --> 58:05.042
he says...

58:05.043 --> 58:06.708
Okay, Okay!

58:07.500 --> 58:12.042
The telephone, it goes
Green... Green... Green...

58:12.417 --> 58:13.749
I Pink it up...

58:13.750 --> 58:15.750
and says Yellow???

58:18.750 --> 58:21.750
Ha Ha... Good one...

58:22.250 --> 58:23.042
Hey!

58:23.042 --> 58:23.750
Oh...

58:23.751 --> 58:27.082
What do you call 4 Mexicans
who drown in the Rio Grande...

58:27.083 --> 58:30.750
while trying to cross
illegally into the U.S.?

58:31.083 --> 58:32.500
I don't know, what?

58:33.750 --> 58:36.750
Quatro Sink-o!!!

58:45.125 --> 58:49.082
I think completely understand
why we have the Purge now.

58:49.083 --> 58:51.125
Huh? What's that?

58:52.500 --> 58:54.625
I said excuse me, I
have to uh, get a refill.

58:54.875 --> 58:55.875
Oh.

58:56.750 --> 58:57.875
Hey!!!

58:58.500 --> 58:59.749
Bring back some Takis!

58:59.750 --> 59:00.750
Sure thing.

59:12.333 --> 59:14.000
You guys good?

59:23.708 --> 59:24.958
What the hell?

59:27.208 --> 59:27.833
Hello!

59:28.208 --> 59:29.208
Hi there!

59:29.500 --> 59:31.125
Wanna make me a drink?

59:32.042 --> 59:34.500
I'm gonna have to
see some ID first...

59:34.792 --> 59:35.667
Uhh...

59:35.667 --> 59:36.625
I'm just kidding...

59:36.626 --> 59:37.917
What will it be?

59:38.250 --> 59:39.500
I dont know!?

59:40.000 --> 59:42.124
Something I've
never had before...

59:42.125 --> 59:43.875
What's your favorite drink?

59:44.208 --> 59:45.999
Hmm?

59:46.000 --> 59:48.999
I think I've got just
the drink in mind...

59:49.000 --> 59:50.332
One special drink...

59:50.333 --> 59:53.333
coming up for
one special lady...

59:55.750 --> 59:58.750
Let's see where they keep
the boose around here...

59:59.208 --> 1:00:00.749
Not here!

1:00:00.750 --> 1:00:01.500
Ah ha!!!

1:00:01.501 --> 1:00:03.249
Here it is!

1:00:03.250 --> 1:00:05.208
Let's see what we got here...

1:00:05.583 --> 1:00:06.500
Shit...

1:00:06.501 --> 1:00:09.582
What the fuck are you
gonna do now Daryl?

1:00:09.583 --> 1:00:11.207
Think think think think!

1:00:11.208 --> 1:00:11.875
Come on...

1:00:11.876 --> 1:00:15.249
You've seen that movie
Cocktail at least a 100 times.

1:00:15.250 --> 1:00:17.207
WWTD???

1:00:17.208 --> 1:00:19.499
What Would Tom Cruise Do???

1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:22.000
Take her to Kokomo!

1:00:24.083 --> 1:00:25.374
Umm...

1:00:25.375 --> 1:00:26.582
I'm really happy...

1:00:26.583 --> 1:00:30.207
I ended up coming tonight
because I thought it was
honestly gonna be super lame...

1:00:30.208 --> 1:00:31.375
But um...

1:00:31.708 --> 1:00:34.083
it ended up being pretty cool...

1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:36.208
Like you...

1:00:40.083 --> 1:00:41.749
Stop staring at her tits...

1:00:41.750 --> 1:00:43.374
She's gonna notice...

1:00:43.375 --> 1:00:44.582
Just take a glance, look away...

1:00:44.583 --> 1:00:47.207
It's like the sun...

1:00:47.208 --> 1:00:49.041
Okay, get a grip, get a grip.

1:00:49.042 --> 1:00:50.583
You got this!

1:00:54.208 --> 1:00:55.167
Oh shit.

1:00:55.168 --> 1:00:56.749
Spided Rum is almost gone.

1:00:56.750 --> 1:00:57.750
Oh crap.

1:00:58.583 --> 1:01:00.999
A little of the blue stuff...

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:02.667
Here we go...

1:01:03.083 --> 1:01:04.374
That shoud do it.

1:01:04.375 --> 1:01:05.582
Oh, there we go...

1:01:05.583 --> 1:01:06.874
Sailor Jerry!

1:01:06.875 --> 1:01:08.250
I'm just gonna...

1:01:11.083 --> 1:01:13.417
Oop, okay...

1:01:15.083 --> 1:01:16.000
Wow!

1:01:16.001 --> 1:01:18.042
That's a lot of liquor!

1:01:18.542 --> 1:01:19.417
Well...

1:01:19.418 --> 1:01:21.750
It takes a lot of liquor to
make this special drink.

1:01:22.083 --> 1:01:24.457
Did you go to bar tending
school or something?

1:01:24.458 --> 1:01:26.582
Umm... no but...

1:01:26.583 --> 1:01:28.624
Prepare yourself
to experience...

1:01:28.625 --> 1:01:31.207
something you've
never tasted before.

1:01:31.208 --> 1:01:32.208
Excuse me.

1:01:33.208 --> 1:01:34.208
Careful...

1:01:39.125 --> 1:01:40.250
Whoa!!!

1:01:40.750 --> 1:01:43.791
Isaac's doing the Pee-Pee
Challenge on FaceSpace Live!

1:01:43.792 --> 1:01:46.250
What the heck is the
Pee-Pee Challenge?

1:01:46.792 --> 1:01:48.249
Is that like one of those...

1:01:48.250 --> 1:01:52.291
Tide Pod things where those
stupid kids eat laundry
detergent?

1:01:52.292 --> 1:01:54.750
Ugh, don't tell me
he's drinking pee...

1:01:55.542 --> 1:01:56.167
No!!

1:01:56.168 --> 1:01:58.582
It's where you dare somebody
to run out into the middle of
the street during the Purge...

1:01:58.583 --> 1:02:00.374
and dance while
they take a leak.

1:02:00.375 --> 1:02:02.457
And then they have to
nominate someone else to do
it...

1:02:02.458 --> 1:02:04.207
And if they don't do it...

1:02:04.208 --> 1:02:06.458
Then you have to
drink your own pee.

1:02:07.333 --> 1:02:10.333
If I ever catch you
doing something like that,

1:02:10.875 --> 1:02:12.832
your ass is grass!

1:02:12.833 --> 1:02:14.625
And I'm the weed whacker!

1:02:15.208 --> 1:02:18.249
It's streaming on like
3 of my friends pages.

1:02:18.250 --> 1:02:20.000
Oh shit, here he goes!

1:02:20.375 --> 1:02:21.749
What's up everybody?

1:02:21.750 --> 1:02:22.999
It's your boy Isaac.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.291
Coming to you live.

1:02:24.292 --> 1:02:25.749
I was nominated by Jessie B.

1:02:25.750 --> 1:02:27.624
And you know
me, I ain't no bitch!!!

1:02:27.625 --> 1:02:28.625
So let's go everybody!

1:02:28.626 --> 1:02:29.874
Pee-Pee Challenge!

1:02:29.875 --> 1:02:31.499
I-S-DOUBLE-A-C!!!

1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:32.707
Let's get it!

1:02:32.708 --> 1:02:33.875
Let's go!

1:02:35.708 --> 1:02:36.875
Yeah!!!

1:02:38.708 --> 1:02:39.667
Pee-Pee,

1:02:39.668 --> 1:02:40.749
Gotta go Pee,

1:02:40.750 --> 1:02:41.999
Piss inside me,

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.249
I don't wanna hold it in.

1:02:43.250 --> 1:02:44.582
I gotta go Pee.

1:02:44.583 --> 1:02:45.999
Let the flow stream.

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.207
Gush outside me.

1:02:47.208 --> 1:02:48.332
Gotta know me.

1:02:48.333 --> 1:02:49.333
It's so foamy.

1:03:13.500 --> 1:03:15.541
Holy Shit!

1:03:15.542 --> 1:03:16.707
Ooh...

1:03:16.708 --> 1:03:18.708
Isaac just got smashed by a car.

1:03:39.458 --> 1:03:41.582
What's up? It's Skizzy!!!

1:03:41.583 --> 1:03:43.249
Coming at you live!

1:03:43.250 --> 1:03:46.749
I'm taking calls right now for
personal delivery by yours
truly.

1:03:46.750 --> 1:03:49.082
And Skizzy's Blow Mobile!!!

1:03:49.083 --> 1:03:51.166
We've got the finest
powder this side of the border

1:03:51.167 --> 1:03:54.167
and delivering direct to
you for the next 10 hours.

1:03:54.417 --> 1:03:55.250
So!!!

1:03:55.251 --> 1:03:57.041
Send me a text,
or give me a call

1:03:57.042 --> 1:04:00.042
at 1-800-YOU-BLOW-ME!

1:04:01.083 --> 1:04:04.667
That's 800-825-6963.

1:04:05.167 --> 1:04:06.999
Have a wonderful Purge!

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.375
I know I will...

1:04:13.333 --> 1:04:15.333
I'll see ya later!!!

1:04:18.583 --> 1:04:20.832
Classic Darwinism.

1:04:20.833 --> 1:04:23.833
Play stupid games,
win stupid prizes.

1:04:24.667 --> 1:04:26.000
Some parents these days.

1:04:28.375 --> 1:04:31.249
I'm glad you're such
a good boy Brian.

1:04:31.250 --> 1:04:33.875
My sweet little accident.

1:04:35.500 --> 1:04:36.625
Accident?

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.499
Oh sweetie, haven't
you heard the story?

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:41.499
We only wanted one child.

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:43.291
What story?

1:04:43.292 --> 1:04:43.958
Honey...

1:04:43.959 --> 1:04:46.249
We were done having kids!

1:04:46.250 --> 1:04:49.207
But 10 years after
your sister was born,

1:04:49.208 --> 1:04:52.207
your father thought he
was doing me a favor...

1:04:52.208 --> 1:04:54.957
by refilling my
Tic Tac dispensor.

1:04:54.958 --> 1:04:57.208
Always sneaking
them out of my purse!

1:04:57.458 --> 1:04:59.333
Hey, love Tic Tacs!

1:04:59.625 --> 1:05:01.957
Except they weren't Tic Tacs!

1:05:01.958 --> 1:05:04.333
They were my
birth control pills!

1:05:04.625 --> 1:05:07.000
What can I say? I'm sorry!!

1:05:07.292 --> 1:05:10.292
They tasted exactly the same!

1:05:10.667 --> 1:05:14.375
Besides, I'm the one who had
the super super sensative
breasts all those years.

1:05:15.375 --> 1:05:17.042
My nipples are
still a bit puffy...

1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:20.332
And you're still
a little bitchy too!!

1:05:20.333 --> 1:05:23.333
Sometimes I swear we
are on the same cycle.

1:05:25.750 --> 1:05:27.833
Wow I...

1:05:28.583 --> 1:05:30.708
I can't believe you
guys didn't want me.

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:32.000
Awe...

1:05:32.001 --> 1:05:35.000
We still love you all the same.

1:05:36.667 --> 1:05:38.375
Get over it.

1:06:01.500 --> 1:06:03.374
A little bit of that...

1:06:03.375 --> 1:06:04.707
Lets see, ooh...

1:06:04.708 --> 1:06:06.999
Gotta have a little
bit of peppermint.

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.166
Mmm...

1:06:08.167 --> 1:06:10.082
And of course some
of the blue stuff.

1:06:10.083 --> 1:06:12.874
Can't get away or go
wrong with the blue...

1:06:12.875 --> 1:06:15.583
And you gotta have a
little Sailor Jerry in there.

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:23.500
And of course we're gonna
wan't just a little something
for some sweetener.

1:06:26.708 --> 1:06:28.125
And...

1:06:28.750 --> 1:06:30.499
Uh, I don't have any fresh lime.

1:06:30.500 --> 1:06:31.999
But I do have this...

1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.041
squeezy bottle that
looks like a lime.

1:06:34.042 --> 1:06:35.749
So, that'll do.

1:06:35.750 --> 1:06:37.167
There we go.

1:06:39.542 --> 1:06:41.500
That should work.

1:06:41.875 --> 1:06:42.999
The top...

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:43.875
and...

1:06:43.876 --> 1:06:45.750
give it a shake!!!

1:07:09.375 --> 1:07:10.999
Done!!

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:12.375
Alright.

1:07:13.875 --> 1:07:14.792
Okay.

1:07:14.793 --> 1:07:16.749
And a little bit of a pour...

1:07:16.750 --> 1:07:18.125
Ooh..

1:07:19.750 --> 1:07:21.625
Ooh it's pretty!

1:07:33.083 --> 1:07:34.083
There you go.

1:07:34.084 --> 1:07:35.332
Bottom's up!

1:07:35.333 --> 1:07:36.750
Cheers!

1:07:46.708 --> 1:07:47.874
Oh!

1:07:47.875 --> 1:07:49.374
Damn!

1:07:49.375 --> 1:07:51.499
What is that drink called?

1:07:51.500 --> 1:07:52.417
Uh..

1:07:52.418 --> 1:07:53.874
I call it...

1:07:53.875 --> 1:07:55.166
Ice.?.?

1:07:55.167 --> 1:07:56.499
Ice!?!

1:07:56.500 --> 1:07:57.541
Baby!?!

1:07:57.542 --> 1:07:59.916
Ice Ice Baby!

1:07:59.917 --> 1:08:01.250
Too cold!!

1:08:01.792 --> 1:08:02.750
I uh...

1:08:02.751 --> 1:08:03.874
I like it...

1:08:03.875 --> 1:08:04.583
You did?

1:08:04.583 --> 1:08:05.333
I... I...

1:08:05.333 --> 1:08:06.250
Yeah, I did.

1:08:06.250 --> 1:08:07.167
Uh...

1:08:07.168 --> 1:08:08.582
It started off..

1:08:08.583 --> 1:08:09.707
Really strong!!

1:08:09.708 --> 1:08:11.249
Like super strong!

1:08:11.250 --> 1:08:12.332
Umm...

1:08:12.333 --> 1:08:14.208
and then it was pepperminty.

1:08:15.083 --> 1:08:16.374
And uh then...

1:08:16.375 --> 1:08:17.499
uh...

1:08:17.500 --> 1:08:18.707
uh, it ended up sweet.

1:08:18.708 --> 1:08:20.166
It was sweet.

1:08:20.167 --> 1:08:21.833
Like you.

1:08:29.083 --> 1:08:31.499
Thanks Daryl!

1:08:31.500 --> 1:08:33.208
You're welcome.

1:08:35.792 --> 1:08:37.750
I think she's in to me.

1:08:41.500 --> 1:08:44.541
Oh, that Donald is one
mean mother fucker!

1:08:44.542 --> 1:08:45.500
Mom!

1:08:45.501 --> 1:08:46.708
The children!

1:08:47.042 --> 1:08:48.875
Such a handsome fella.

1:08:49.375 --> 1:08:52.375
If I had any feeling left down
there, I would need to purge
myself!!!

1:08:53.875 --> 1:08:55.874
Drain the swamp if
you know what I mean.

1:08:55.875 --> 1:08:57.208
Mother!!

1:08:57.750 --> 1:09:00.999
What would dad do if he
were alive today to hear you
speak of such things?

1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.874
Oh let me tell you!

1:09:02.875 --> 1:09:04.875
He always liked to watch me!

1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:08.875
Nothing like a little voyeurism
to spice it up in the bedroom.

1:09:09.875 --> 1:09:12.832
I would rather not imagine
you and daddy doing your private
business.

1:09:12.833 --> 1:09:15.249
Or touching your naughty parts.

1:09:15.250 --> 1:09:17.082
Well how do you
think you got here?

1:09:17.083 --> 1:09:18.666
Immaculate conception?

1:09:18.667 --> 1:09:21.500
Even still, we have
young ears present.

1:09:22.583 --> 1:09:24.041
It's okay mom.

1:09:24.042 --> 1:09:26.666
People talk like that
at school all the time.

1:09:26.667 --> 1:09:29.250
You'd be surprised what
children are capable of these
days.

1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:36.249
Turn right at the next street.

1:09:36.250 --> 1:09:37.167
Right here?

1:09:37.167 --> 1:09:38.167
Yep.

1:09:53.583 --> 1:09:56.958
Keep going and it should
be right at the end of the
court.

1:09:58.792 --> 1:10:00.375
Let's park here.

1:10:43.542 --> 1:10:45.874
You look so pretty.

1:10:45.875 --> 1:10:47.791
You're all grown up now.

1:10:47.792 --> 1:10:49.041
Alright Hope...

1:10:49.042 --> 1:10:50.667
do you remember what to do?

1:10:51.083 --> 1:10:55.582
You're gonna walk up to the door
and ring the doorbell all by
yourself.

1:10:55.583 --> 1:10:58.583
Just like mommy
taught you. Okay?

1:10:59.500 --> 1:11:01.499
Now put this
underneath your sign.

1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:04.208
Daddy will be
watching right over here.

1:11:04.708 --> 1:11:06.582
You have nothing to fear.

1:11:06.583 --> 1:11:08.667
Just like we practiced. Okay?

1:11:09.333 --> 1:11:10.582
Go on now.

1:11:10.583 --> 1:11:12.708
Make mommy and daddy proud.

1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:15.000
Go get 'em tiger.

1:12:50.417 --> 1:12:51.750
Well...

1:12:52.125 --> 1:12:53.292
hello there.

1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:57.875
What ya doing outside all here
by your lonesome young lady?

1:12:58.500 --> 1:13:01.542
It's not safe to be
outside this time of day.

1:13:02.375 --> 1:13:04.582
You should be with
someone that can...

1:13:04.583 --> 1:13:07.374
protect you and keep
you safe from those that...

1:13:07.375 --> 1:13:09.958
might try to harm you.

1:13:11.583 --> 1:13:14.333
You need not be afraid of me.

1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:17.374
Why don't you turn around...

1:13:17.375 --> 1:13:19.333
so I can get a good look at ya.

1:13:20.333 --> 1:13:23.333
That's such a
pretty little dress.

1:13:25.125 --> 1:13:26.250
What's this?

1:13:26.875 --> 1:13:27.875
You need help...

1:13:27.875 --> 1:13:28.875
little girl?

1:13:30.125 --> 1:13:31.624
Well.

1:13:31.625 --> 1:13:32.250
Why...

1:13:32.251 --> 1:13:34.375
why don't you
come inside? And...

1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.749
I can watch you
for the time being.

1:13:36.750 --> 1:13:37.916
And...

1:13:37.917 --> 1:13:40.499
Besides, I'm sure
we can figure out...

1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:42.583
what to do with you!

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.499
Wait a minute!

1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:45.000
What's this?

1:13:45.001 --> 1:13:46.374
Now wait, wait, wait wait.

1:13:46.375 --> 1:13:47.832
I don't mean you no harm.

1:13:47.833 --> 1:13:49.583
I don't mean you any harm!

1:13:50.083 --> 1:13:51.083
No, I...

1:14:13.875 --> 1:14:15.249
You did so well!

1:14:15.250 --> 1:14:17.166
I'm so proud of you!

1:14:17.167 --> 1:14:19.082
That's my little girl!

1:14:19.083 --> 1:14:20.875
Just a little mess here.

1:14:27.042 --> 1:14:27.875
There now...

1:14:27.876 --> 1:14:29.041
all better!

1:14:29.042 --> 1:14:30.582
Now wasn't that fun?

1:14:30.583 --> 1:14:31.583
Yes mother.

1:14:32.083 --> 1:14:35.083
Let's go to the next house and
see if any perverts are home.

1:14:35.375 --> 1:14:37.750
I have the list right here!

1:14:56.750 --> 1:15:00.250
Don't think I don't know
what you're up to young lady.

1:15:00.667 --> 1:15:01.375
Me?

1:15:01.376 --> 1:15:02.416
What?

1:15:02.417 --> 1:15:05.417
I see the way you
looked at that boy.

1:15:06.375 --> 1:15:08.499
Don't think I wasn't
your age once.

1:15:08.500 --> 1:15:09.749
Oh really?

1:15:09.750 --> 1:15:12.375
And what is it that
you think I am up to?

1:15:13.750 --> 1:15:16.166
Well, the first time
I saw your father...

1:15:16.167 --> 1:15:17.541
hmm...

1:15:17.542 --> 1:15:19.750
such a strapping young lad.

1:15:20.375 --> 1:15:22.832
He was just stepping off a bus

1:15:22.833 --> 1:15:25.250
coming home from
a tour in Vietnam.

1:15:26.208 --> 1:15:28.332
There's something
about a man in uniform

1:15:28.333 --> 1:15:31.333
that gives you the butterflies
in your flower petals.

1:15:32.125 --> 1:15:33.125
Flower petals?

1:15:33.542 --> 1:15:34.417
You know?

1:15:34.418 --> 1:15:35.874
Your 2 lips

1:15:35.875 --> 1:15:36.750
Tulips!

1:15:36.750 --> 1:15:37.625
Get it?

1:15:37.626 --> 1:15:40.625
That's what we used to called
them when your mama was a little
girl.

1:15:41.750 --> 1:15:44.750
I think I'm gonna excuse myself
from the rest of this
conversation.

1:15:46.292 --> 1:15:49.292
What is it with you guys
and your swampy tulips?

1:15:50.375 --> 1:15:51.375
Jen...

1:15:53.250 --> 1:15:55.999
Here, you just make sure you
take right precautionary
measures.

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:57.374
Oh my god mom no.

1:15:57.375 --> 1:15:58.582
You're so embarrassing.

1:15:58.583 --> 1:15:59.583
Well, Jen...

1:15:59.584 --> 1:16:01.458
I can't stop you from
doing what your gonna do.

1:16:01.958 --> 1:16:03.957
You never know when
you might need them.

1:16:03.958 --> 1:16:04.583
Now...

1:16:04.583 --> 1:16:05.208
here.

1:16:05.209 --> 1:16:08.208
The least I can do is help
you prevent any accidents.

1:16:09.583 --> 1:16:11.291
Still love you Brian.

1:16:11.292 --> 1:16:13.167
Oh my gosh mom!

1:16:22.042 --> 1:16:23.000
Hmm...

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.000
They're spearmint.

1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:26.125
Your mom's favorite.

1:16:29.708 --> 1:16:30.208
Okay...

1:16:30.208 --> 1:16:31.167
Eww!

1:16:31.168 --> 1:16:32.999
Kids, it's getting late.

1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.000
And...

1:16:34.001 --> 1:16:36.207
I packed jammies for everyone.

1:16:36.208 --> 1:16:37.208
So!

1:16:39.208 --> 1:16:42.332
Let's get into them so you are
all
comforable throughout the night.

1:16:42.333 --> 1:16:43.666
Here you go Jen.

1:16:43.667 --> 1:16:44.667
Okay.

1:16:45.250 --> 1:16:46.000
And for dad.

1:16:46.001 --> 1:16:48.000
I haven't worn these in forever.

1:16:48.333 --> 1:16:50.832
Yeah mom, we don't need to
be tucked in for nite nite
anymore.

1:16:50.833 --> 1:16:51.333
Well.

1:16:51.334 --> 1:16:53.916
As long as you are under
the same roof with me,

1:16:53.917 --> 1:16:56.542
you will follow my rules.

1:16:56.750 --> 1:16:57.750
Thank you.

1:16:57.751 --> 1:16:59.249
Oh, that reminds me!

1:16:59.250 --> 1:17:00.167
Brian!

1:17:00.168 --> 1:17:02.374
I made you a little
something special

1:17:02.375 --> 1:17:04.250
to keep you warm at night!

1:17:21.042 --> 1:17:23.083
Grandma you...

1:17:23.500 --> 1:17:24.749
didn't have to.

1:17:24.750 --> 1:17:25.999
Oh don't be silly.

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.167
Now go try it on, I
want to see how it fits!

1:17:29.583 --> 1:17:30.583
Do I have to?

1:17:31.708 --> 1:17:33.042
Don't be rude now.

1:17:33.375 --> 1:17:37.042
I'm sure grandma put a lot of
love and time into making that.

1:17:38.167 --> 1:17:39.750
Show some appreciation.

1:17:42.583 --> 1:17:44.000
The tag says made in China.

1:17:44.250 --> 1:17:45.250
Go!!

1:17:45.750 --> 1:17:46.750
Fine!

1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:53.250
Such as fine young man.

1:17:54.083 --> 1:17:57.417
He's a spittin' image of your
father when he was that age.

1:18:02.750 --> 1:18:04.417
Shit, should
probably lose the vest.

1:18:14.458 --> 1:18:15.333
Oh shit.

1:18:15.334 --> 1:18:18.208
My hair looks
like shit like usual.

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:20.292
Ooh... I need to...

1:18:20.792 --> 1:18:22.500
Slightly pepperminty.

1:18:24.792 --> 1:18:26.124
Get a little pump going.

1:18:26.125 --> 1:18:27.125
Do some pushups.

1:18:33.625 --> 1:18:35.167
What in the fuck are you doing?

1:18:36.292 --> 1:18:37.167
Hey uh...

1:18:37.167 --> 1:18:37.875
Just uh...

1:18:37.876 --> 1:18:39.457
Keeping the old blood flowing.

1:18:39.458 --> 1:18:41.874
Gotta be ready for
anything. You know?

1:18:41.875 --> 1:18:43.957
Stop humping my kitchen floor!

1:18:43.958 --> 1:18:45.874
You were supposed
to bring back Takis!

1:18:45.875 --> 1:18:47.832
Oops... Shit that's right!

1:18:47.833 --> 1:18:49.458
Don't bother, I'll get 'em.

1:18:58.750 --> 1:19:00.917
Sorry about that.

1:19:26.083 --> 1:19:27.999
Do I really have to wear this?

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.208
So embarrassing.

1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:31.499
Oh you look so handsome!

1:19:31.500 --> 1:19:33.208
I could just squeeze ya!

1:19:35.500 --> 1:19:37.500
Come on son, what do you say?

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.333
Thanks grandma...

1:19:41.042 --> 1:19:42.874
I just knew you'd love it.

1:19:42.875 --> 1:19:47.042
Now you come here and sit down
by me and be my big
Bri-Bri-Bear.

1:19:59.375 --> 1:20:02.082
John, you were picked
as a team leader.

1:20:02.083 --> 1:20:04.042
Let's see your design!

1:20:04.750 --> 1:20:07.830
Well Donald, I think
you're really gonna enjoy what
we've come up with for you.

1:20:08.042 --> 1:20:09.583
Let's bring out the model.

1:20:15.750 --> 1:20:17.082
Interesting.

1:20:17.083 --> 1:20:18.208
What's this?

1:20:19.208 --> 1:20:21.582
This is a rich
corinthian leather

1:20:21.583 --> 1:20:22.542
crotchless

1:20:22.542 --> 1:20:23.250
panty

1:20:23.251 --> 1:20:24.583
with matching bra.

1:20:27.167 --> 1:20:28.000
Oh gosh.

1:20:28.001 --> 1:20:29.083
Donjerie?

1:20:29.542 --> 1:20:32.000
I wonder if you can
order it on the website?

1:20:32.250 --> 1:20:33.874
I can see it's crotchless,

1:20:33.875 --> 1:20:35.750
but what's that on the sides?

1:20:36.167 --> 1:20:37.582
I thought you might notice that.

1:20:37.583 --> 1:20:42.916
Those are special placed
handle grips made from 7075
aircraft grade aluminum alloy.

1:20:42.917 --> 1:20:45.083
The same material
used in fighter jets.

1:20:45.875 --> 1:20:47.250
Handle grips?

1:20:47.750 --> 1:20:49.250
Handle grips for what?

1:20:49.667 --> 1:20:51.082
Well, you know...

1:20:51.083 --> 1:20:53.750
So you can... Grab
'em by the pussy!

1:20:59.333 --> 1:21:00.457
Those idiots.

1:21:00.458 --> 1:21:02.583
And you thought that
would be a good idea?

1:21:03.500 --> 1:21:04.250
Well...

1:21:04.251 --> 1:21:05.999
I saw your open
mic interview on TV,

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:09.250
and I thought surely a man
of your taste would appriciate
such fine amenities.

1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:11.792
You thought wrong...

1:21:12.042 --> 1:21:14.000
Drew Careys!

1:21:14.500 --> 1:21:15.500
Come again?

1:21:15.501 --> 1:21:16.917
Dra Carris?

1:21:17.625 --> 1:21:18.791
I don't quite follow.

1:21:18.792 --> 1:21:20.749
You know, Dracarys!!

1:21:20.750 --> 1:21:22.374
Your Fired!!!

1:21:22.375 --> 1:21:23.125
Wait...

1:21:23.125 --> 1:21:24.125
Wait...

1:21:24.417 --> 1:21:25.792
I can make it in gold...

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.208
Get him out of here!

1:21:27.958 --> 1:21:28.958
Wait...

1:21:29.458 --> 1:21:30.833
What about diamond crusted?

1:21:31.583 --> 1:21:32.333
Diamond crusted!!!

1:21:32.333 --> 1:21:32.958
Out now!!!

1:21:32.958 --> 1:21:33.958
Loser!!

1:21:38.708 --> 1:21:40.000
Ahh that's funny.

1:21:43.958 --> 1:21:46.125
Must obtain more beverage.

1:21:46.542 --> 1:21:47.500
Sorry...

1:21:47.501 --> 1:21:51.375
I just binge watched the entire
8 seasons of Game of Thrones.

1:22:02.333 --> 1:22:04.499
Do you wanna have rock hard abs?

1:22:04.500 --> 1:22:06.707
Well how about
a rock hard penis?

1:22:06.708 --> 1:22:07.999
Well you can have both!!

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:09.499
Introducing...

1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:11.499
Steel Labido!!!

1:22:11.500 --> 1:22:13.374
Have you been called pudgy?

1:22:13.375 --> 1:22:15.082
How about flacid?

1:22:15.083 --> 1:22:18.583
You can have a 6 pack
torpedo of Steel Labido!

1:22:19.208 --> 1:22:20.000
Just as I thought.

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.000
For only 17 payments

1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:21.708
Another quiet night.

1:22:21.709 --> 1:22:22.999
Of $49.95.

1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:24.707
That's the beauty of living
out here in the country.

1:22:24.708 --> 1:22:26.082
I don't always work out.

1:22:26.083 --> 1:22:27.749
Still think we should all
stay together until morning.

1:22:27.750 --> 1:22:28.417
But when I do,

1:22:28.417 --> 1:22:29.208
just to be safe.

1:22:29.209 --> 1:22:30.624
I go hard!!

1:22:30.625 --> 1:22:32.291
We can alternate watches
so we can all get some rest.

1:22:32.292 --> 1:22:33.541
Steel Labido!!!

1:22:33.542 --> 1:22:34.083
Daryl??

1:22:34.083 --> 1:22:35.083
Whoo!!!

1:22:35.084 --> 1:22:37.374
Please see a Doctor if your
erection lasts longer than 5
hours...

1:22:37.375 --> 1:22:37.750
Figures...

1:22:37.751 --> 1:22:39.111
Not recommended
for small children.

1:22:46.500 --> 1:22:48.208
What's going on here?
Who the hell are you?

1:22:50.083 --> 1:22:52.207
Deputy Director Johnson.

1:22:52.208 --> 1:22:53.208
Welcome

1:22:53.209 --> 1:22:54.583
to the anual Purge.

1:22:55.375 --> 1:22:56.999
Sorry about the
little boo boo, we...

1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:58.520
forgot to strap you
in on the way here.

1:22:59.750 --> 1:23:00.999
What's the meaning of this?

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.083
Who are you?

1:23:02.708 --> 1:23:03.874
What do you want with me?

1:23:03.875 --> 1:23:04.875
What do we want?

1:23:04.875 --> 1:23:05.708
Yeah!!

1:23:05.709 --> 1:23:07.832
You think we got all
dressed up like this...

1:23:07.833 --> 1:23:09.749
just to come over and say...

1:23:09.750 --> 1:23:11.083
Hello neighbor!?!?

1:23:11.375 --> 1:23:12.750
Come on Harold...

1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:14.749
You're a smart guy!

1:23:14.750 --> 1:23:16.000
It's the Purge.

1:23:17.500 --> 1:23:19.916
You know what the word
Purge means don't you?

1:23:19.917 --> 1:23:23.750
No! No! You can't touch
me! I'm a government official!!

1:23:24.875 --> 1:23:25.875
Well...

1:23:26.417 --> 1:23:28.582
You'll be know as a former...

1:23:28.583 --> 1:23:29.917
government official.

1:23:30.583 --> 1:23:31.749
No! No!

1:23:31.750 --> 1:23:34.249
I have immunity from the Purge!

1:23:34.250 --> 1:23:34.875
Immunity?

1:23:34.875 --> 1:23:35.875
Yes!!!

1:23:41.708 --> 1:23:42.833
Well...

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.208
let's see about that!

1:23:47.208 --> 1:23:48.083
Ahhh!!!

1:23:48.084 --> 1:23:50.041
Ahhh!! That's
my fucking hand!!!

1:23:50.042 --> 1:23:50.917
What are you doing???

1:23:50.918 --> 1:23:52.000
Ahhh!!!

1:23:52.250 --> 1:23:53.874
Looks like you don't
have immunity after all.

1:23:53.875 --> 1:23:54.750
Fuck!!!

1:23:54.750 --> 1:23:55.250
Nope!

1:23:55.251 --> 1:23:57.166
What the hell man???
That's my, that's my hand!!!

1:23:57.167 --> 1:23:58.125
Not any more.

1:23:58.125 --> 1:23:58.750
Fuck!

1:23:58.751 --> 1:23:59.874
What do you want?
Money? You want...

1:23:59.875 --> 1:24:01.791
I can get you money!
Do you need money?

1:24:01.792 --> 1:24:02.417
No!!!

1:24:02.417 --> 1:24:03.000
Shit!!!

1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:03.625
No!!!

1:24:03.625 --> 1:24:04.500
Mother!!!

1:24:04.501 --> 1:24:06.124
We want your resignation.

1:24:06.125 --> 1:24:07.249
What??? Resignation???

1:24:07.250 --> 1:24:09.170
Are you kid... I don't
even fucking understand...

1:24:10.417 --> 1:24:11.417
It's simple.

1:24:11.750 --> 1:24:13.249
Consider this...

1:24:13.250 --> 1:24:14.208
a demotion!

1:24:14.208 --> 1:24:15.208
No! Wait! Wait!!

1:24:24.208 --> 1:24:25.208
Oh...

1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:34.000
Oof...

1:24:34.001 --> 1:24:35.167
Must tinkle!!!

1:24:40.875 --> 1:24:43.875
Now which was was
that damn bathroom?

1:25:24.875 --> 1:25:26.083
Open the gate!

1:26:05.875 --> 1:26:07.750
You 3, go to the left
to case the house.

1:26:08.250 --> 1:26:09.874
You guys, go to the right.

1:26:09.875 --> 1:26:10.875
Keep your eyes open!

1:26:10.876 --> 1:26:12.541
The moneys around
here somewhere!

1:26:12.542 --> 1:26:14.167
Show no mercy!

1:26:38.125 --> 1:26:39.499
Oh fuck!!

1:26:39.500 --> 1:26:40.500
Ahhhhh!!!!!!

1:26:43.917 --> 1:26:44.875
Sweet Jesus!!

1:26:44.875 --> 1:26:45.667
What was that?

1:26:45.668 --> 1:26:47.499
It sounded like an explosion!!!

1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:49.042
That was a booby trap!

1:26:49.417 --> 1:26:50.791
Either we have visitors,

1:26:50.792 --> 1:26:52.375
or one of them damn
goats got out again.

1:26:52.625 --> 1:26:53.874
Kids are you okay???
Are you okay???

1:26:53.875 --> 1:26:54.750
Yeah, yeah mom we're okay.

1:26:54.750 --> 1:26:55.375
Hey!

1:26:55.375 --> 1:26:56.167
Get him!

1:26:56.167 --> 1:26:56.792
Tom!

1:26:56.792 --> 1:26:57.375
Dad!

1:26:57.375 --> 1:26:57.917
Tom!

1:26:57.917 --> 1:26:58.542
Tom!

1:26:58.542 --> 1:26:59.000
Dad!

1:26:59.000 --> 1:26:59.500
What? What??

1:26:59.500 --> 1:26:59.958
Wake up!

1:26:59.959 --> 1:27:01.624
There was a loud boom outside!!

1:27:01.625 --> 1:27:02.458
I didn't hear anything...

1:27:02.458 --> 1:27:03.083
Come on get up!

1:27:03.083 --> 1:27:03.375
Come on Tom!

1:27:03.375 --> 1:27:03.833
Get up get up!

1:27:03.834 --> 1:27:04.957
Wait! Where's grandma???

1:27:04.958 --> 1:27:05.458
Come on!

1:27:05.750 --> 1:27:06.583
What???

1:27:06.583 --> 1:27:07.500
Mom!!!

1:27:07.501 --> 1:27:09.332
Bill, you don't think
mom wandered outside?

1:27:09.333 --> 1:27:10.208
Stay Calm!

1:27:10.209 --> 1:27:11.333
Stay calm!

1:27:11.708 --> 1:27:12.500
Daryl!

1:27:12.500 --> 1:27:13.500
I need to talk to you!

1:27:14.083 --> 1:27:14.500
Stay right there.

1:27:14.500 --> 1:27:14.833
What's going on?

1:27:14.833 --> 1:27:15.833
We got this!

1:27:16.458 --> 1:27:17.458
Stay right there!

1:27:22.250 --> 1:27:23.167
Daryl...

1:27:23.167 --> 1:27:24.042
I need you to stay here

1:27:24.043 --> 1:27:25.250
and protect my family.

1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:26.917
I need to go outside,

1:27:26.917 --> 1:27:27.875
check the perimeter

1:27:27.876 --> 1:27:29.000
and see what's going on.

1:27:29.875 --> 1:27:31.374
Yeah sure um...

1:27:31.375 --> 1:27:32.415
How should I protect them?

1:27:32.875 --> 1:27:34.166
With your service piece.

1:27:34.167 --> 1:27:35.000
What do you mean?

1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:35.583
I left it at home.

1:27:35.583 --> 1:27:36.583
I'm off duty!

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.500
Jesus Christ Daryl!

1:27:38.708 --> 1:27:40.707
Just because you punch
out on the timeclock

1:27:40.708 --> 1:27:43.000
does not mean you
stop delivering justice.

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.000
Here!

1:27:51.750 --> 1:27:52.750
Use this!

1:27:54.208 --> 1:27:55.666
Do you always carry 2 guns?

1:27:55.667 --> 1:27:56.708
3...

1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.167
Alrighty...

1:27:59.917 --> 1:28:01.250
Where's the safety?

1:28:02.875 --> 1:28:04.375
It's called your finger.

1:28:04.917 --> 1:28:06.416
When you're ready
to shoot something,

1:28:06.417 --> 1:28:07.875
squeeze the trigger.

1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:09.667
Here...

1:28:09.667 --> 1:28:10.667
put these in your pocket.

1:28:10.668 --> 1:28:11.708
You might need them later.

1:28:15.208 --> 1:28:16.375
You got this brother.

1:28:16.583 --> 1:28:17.583
Alright.

1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:19.750
Lock the door behind me.

1:28:20.208 --> 1:28:21.375
Be careful out there.

1:28:43.750 --> 1:28:46.500
It's just me and you Betsy!

1:28:47.375 --> 1:28:48.375
Come get some!!!

1:28:48.376 --> 1:28:50.083
Don't be pointing that
around the house!!!

1:28:51.167 --> 1:28:53.082
Are you sure you're
qualified to handle that thing?

1:28:53.083 --> 1:28:54.499
Yes ma'am!

1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:56.541
I'm a sworn officer of the law.

1:28:56.542 --> 1:28:58.417
Here to serve and
protect children

1:28:58.750 --> 1:29:01.583
and sweet women
such as your lovely self.

1:29:02.375 --> 1:29:03.499
Ahhh shit.

1:29:03.500 --> 1:29:04.250
Crap!!

1:29:04.500 --> 1:29:05.250
You have one?

1:29:05.250 --> 1:29:06.250
You have one for me?

1:29:08.250 --> 1:29:09.250
Thank you.

1:29:11.250 --> 1:29:12.250
Locked and loaded.

1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.583
My uncle Bill know
you have that?

1:29:15.333 --> 1:29:16.875
Yes ma'am he gave it to me.

1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:19.458
Oh God help us.

1:29:28.250 --> 1:29:29.542
Pew Pew...

1:29:36.250 --> 1:29:37.375
Jenna?

1:29:48.583 --> 1:29:50.500
Looks like we've got a problem.

1:29:58.000 --> 1:29:59.625
Just as I thought...

1:30:00.208 --> 1:30:01.208
Burrr!!!

1:30:03.375 --> 1:30:04.833
Takes care of that.

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:09.125
Sweet Jesus!

1:30:09.625 --> 1:30:10.875
Takes care of what?

1:30:11.500 --> 1:30:13.249
Well, the heaters on and...

1:30:13.250 --> 1:30:15.499
someone left the
bedroom window open.

1:30:15.500 --> 1:30:17.625
I just saved Bill money
on his electric bill.

1:30:18.375 --> 1:30:19.375
Our hero!

1:30:20.583 --> 1:30:21.707
You know, you should...

1:30:21.708 --> 1:30:24.833
probably be a little more
careful
sneaking up from behind people.

1:30:25.167 --> 1:30:26.708
Especially someone who is...

1:30:28.583 --> 1:30:29.583
packing...

1:30:30.375 --> 1:30:31.250
Oh yeah?

1:30:31.251 --> 1:30:33.000
What, would you have
busted a cap at me?

1:30:33.333 --> 1:30:34.333
Well...

1:30:34.500 --> 1:30:35.832
I wasn't really expecting it.

1:30:35.833 --> 1:30:36.708
And it...

1:30:36.708 --> 1:30:37.583
just happened so fast...

1:30:37.583 --> 1:30:38.333
that I...

1:30:38.334 --> 1:30:40.332
really didn't have
enough time to pull out.

1:30:40.333 --> 1:30:41.333
You're lucky!

1:30:41.708 --> 1:30:42.250
Well...

1:30:42.251 --> 1:30:43.771
Maybe you just need
some more practice?

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:45.667
I pracitce...

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:47.750
I practice lots!

1:30:48.542 --> 1:30:49.375
I mean...

1:30:49.375 --> 1:30:50.292
not too much!

1:30:50.292 --> 1:30:51.292
But...

1:30:51.417 --> 1:30:52.375
enough!

1:30:52.376 --> 1:30:54.042
I can be ready
when the time comes.

1:30:55.542 --> 1:30:56.708
Pulling out's over rated.

1:30:57.250 --> 1:30:58.250
Uh...

1:30:59.167 --> 1:30:59.750
I can...

1:30:59.751 --> 1:31:01.375
keep it in if you prefer...

1:31:03.375 --> 1:31:04.708
So you're on a dating app huh?

1:31:05.083 --> 1:31:07.323
There's no lucky girl at
home waiting for you to get off?

1:31:08.083 --> 1:31:09.083
No.

1:31:09.250 --> 1:31:10.707
I don't get out much these days.

1:31:10.708 --> 1:31:11.500
It's...

1:31:11.501 --> 1:31:13.000
hard to meet real people.

1:31:13.500 --> 1:31:14.000
So,

1:31:14.208 --> 1:31:16.875
I figured... why not
try the old interwebs?

1:31:17.208 --> 1:31:19.000
But I'm here with
you, right now...

1:31:19.250 --> 1:31:20.500
Am I not real to you?

1:31:21.708 --> 1:31:22.749
I mean...

1:31:22.750 --> 1:31:24.500
you look real...

1:31:24.708 --> 1:31:26.208
and...

1:31:26.542 --> 1:31:29.583
I'm not one to question the
validity of a womans anatomy.

1:31:30.083 --> 1:31:31.083
But,

1:31:31.875 --> 1:31:33.083
from what I can tell,

1:31:33.667 --> 1:31:35.750
you're as beautiful a
woman as they come!

1:31:41.083 --> 1:31:42.083
You're cute!

1:31:42.167 --> 1:31:43.249
Umm...

1:31:43.250 --> 1:31:44.375
thanks, you, you're...

1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:46.000
you're very...

1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:47.500
Thank you!

1:31:47.875 --> 1:31:48.542
Come on Daryl.

1:31:48.543 --> 1:31:49.750
We should stick together.

1:31:59.167 --> 1:32:01.083
Looks like we got
ourselves some visitors.

1:32:35.458 --> 1:32:36.999
What in the hell is
going on out there?

1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:37.833
I don't know.

1:32:37.834 --> 1:32:39.754
It sounds like people
are shooting at each other.

1:32:56.500 --> 1:32:57.167
Shit!!!

1:32:57.417 --> 1:32:59.750
Those are definitely
different calibers firing.

1:33:00.542 --> 1:33:01.917
Do you see anyone out there?

1:33:02.500 --> 1:33:04.000
That's a lot of gun fire.

1:33:04.250 --> 1:33:05.625
Even I can hear that.

1:33:06.500 --> 1:33:08.500
Sub-machine gun, 9mm.

1:33:08.750 --> 1:33:11.000
Heard that all day long
when I was overseas.

1:33:11.583 --> 1:33:12.707
Can you see Bill?

1:33:12.708 --> 1:33:13.875
Is he okay?

1:33:15.167 --> 1:33:17.000
It's difficult to make
of what's going on.

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:19.800
Should somebody go out
there and check on him?

1:33:25.375 --> 1:33:28.082
Honey, maybe we should get
away from the window and...

1:33:28.083 --> 1:33:30.375
go back to the couch
where it's safer?

1:33:31.250 --> 1:33:34.000
I think Daryl has
things in hand here.

1:33:35.042 --> 1:33:38.042
I'm pretty sure I've seen
multiple
people moving around out there.

1:33:38.792 --> 1:33:40.124
I think we're surrounded.

1:33:40.125 --> 1:33:41.542
Oh my God...

1:33:41.875 --> 1:33:42.750
Tom!

1:33:42.751 --> 1:33:44.874
Should you go out
there and help Bill?

1:33:44.875 --> 1:33:48.000
My duty is to stay right
here and look after my family!

1:33:48.542 --> 1:33:51.000
Bill's trained to
handle this sort of thing.

1:33:51.375 --> 1:33:52.875
I'm sure he's okay.

1:33:53.708 --> 1:33:56.375
Come on, let's go back to
the living room where it's safe.

1:33:56.708 --> 1:33:57.875
Jenna, you too!

1:33:58.667 --> 1:34:00.027
No, I'm gonna
stay here with Daryl.

1:34:00.375 --> 1:34:01.042
Come on!

1:34:01.043 --> 1:34:02.667
No, I can take
care of myself dad!

1:34:50.250 --> 1:34:51.875
Jax Maxwell!?!?

1:34:54.375 --> 1:34:55.375
Sergeant...

1:34:55.375 --> 1:34:56.208
Jax...

1:34:56.208 --> 1:34:57.208
Maxwell!?!?

1:35:12.167 --> 1:35:13.167
Fucking body armor!!!

1:35:13.667 --> 1:35:14.042
I...

1:35:14.043 --> 1:35:15.542
think I hear a skilsaw...

1:35:26.708 --> 1:35:27.958
What the hell is that?

1:35:29.958 --> 1:35:30.958
Wait, where are you going?

1:35:30.959 --> 1:35:32.082
I'm going in the other room.

1:35:32.083 --> 1:35:33.083
There's something out there.

1:35:33.084 --> 1:35:34.457
I need to get a better look.

1:35:34.458 --> 1:35:36.083
I need you to stay
here with your family.

1:35:36.625 --> 1:35:37.375
I'll be right back!

1:35:37.375 --> 1:35:38.375
Okay!

1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:41.250
Wait, you promise???

1:35:42.917 --> 1:35:44.250
Fuck yeah I do!!!

1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:46.500
Uh, what was that???

1:35:48.500 --> 1:35:49.500
A pinky swear...

1:36:36.667 --> 1:36:38.750
What the hell is that?

1:36:40.375 --> 1:36:41.208
Ahhh!!!

1:36:41.209 --> 1:36:42.500
Jesus Christ!!!

1:36:47.042 --> 1:36:48.667
What the hell was that?

1:36:49.583 --> 1:36:50.167
Okay...

1:36:50.375 --> 1:36:51.000
Okay.

1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:52.000
Okay, Okay, Okay...

1:36:53.208 --> 1:36:54.583
I know I'm not crazy.

1:37:02.583 --> 1:37:03.583
Hey!!

1:37:03.917 --> 1:37:04.917
Hello??

1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:07.250
Give us the money man...

1:37:07.583 --> 1:37:08.750
and we'll let you live.

1:37:11.542 --> 1:37:12.542
Stay back!!

1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:14.042
I will shoot...

1:37:14.583 --> 1:37:15.875
If you come any closer!

1:37:24.083 --> 1:37:25.374
I told you...

1:37:25.375 --> 1:37:26.500
to stay back!!

1:37:27.042 --> 1:37:28.042
Listen Daryl...

1:37:28.250 --> 1:37:30.082
Let's talk about
this man to man.

1:37:30.083 --> 1:37:31.500
I don't want to hurt you.

1:37:32.375 --> 1:37:34.500
I can get you out
of this situation!

1:37:36.083 --> 1:37:37.083
How...

1:37:38.083 --> 1:37:39.583
How do you know my name???

1:37:39.875 --> 1:37:40.875
And why should I...

1:37:40.876 --> 1:37:43.208
trust someone who's holding
an axe and wearing a mask???

1:37:43.500 --> 1:37:44.542
Okay, okay...

1:37:45.375 --> 1:37:46.542
I'll drop my weapon,

1:37:47.250 --> 1:37:48.250
and lift up my mask.

1:37:53.792 --> 1:37:54.792
There...

1:37:55.167 --> 1:37:56.167
is that better?

1:37:57.250 --> 1:37:58.250
No!!!

1:38:00.250 --> 1:38:00.875
Look!

1:38:01.167 --> 1:38:02.916
The guys know the
money's in there.

1:38:02.917 --> 1:38:05.375
Just hand it over,
and this will all be over.

1:38:05.625 --> 1:38:06.292
Look.

1:38:06.293 --> 1:38:07.500
I'm taking off my mask.

1:38:12.875 --> 1:38:15.333
I don't know anything
about any money.

1:38:15.833 --> 1:38:17.708
Stop playing games man.

1:38:18.583 --> 1:38:19.999
The guys know
the money's in there

1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:21.625
and they're gonna
stop at nothing...

1:38:22.083 --> 1:38:23.625
Including killing your ass.

1:38:24.333 --> 1:38:26.458
I can get you out
of this situation.

1:38:27.417 --> 1:38:28.417
Let me help you.

1:38:29.125 --> 1:38:31.250
You know it's not
safe to be here.

1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:38.000
You know it's not
safe to be here.

1:38:40.417 --> 1:38:41.417
It's you.

1:38:42.375 --> 1:38:44.000
You're the guy
from the gas station!

1:38:45.083 --> 1:38:46.832
I knew you didn't
want to help me!

1:38:46.833 --> 1:38:48.083
You just wanted to kill me!!

1:38:51.375 --> 1:38:53.000
I'm not gonna tell you again.

1:38:54.333 --> 1:38:57.333
If you don't hand over
that 1.4 million dollars...

1:38:58.083 --> 1:38:59.708
I'm gonna come in that house...

1:39:00.333 --> 1:39:02.708
and kill every last one
of you motherfuckers!

1:39:03.583 --> 1:39:04.833
It's your choice.

1:39:05.708 --> 1:39:06.749
Look man,

1:39:06.750 --> 1:39:07.750
you must have a...

1:39:07.875 --> 1:39:09.042
a hearing problem.

1:39:09.375 --> 1:39:10.042
Because...

1:39:10.043 --> 1:39:11.125
I've already told you

1:39:11.375 --> 1:39:12.749
I don't know anything

1:39:12.750 --> 1:39:14.042
about any money.

1:39:15.583 --> 1:39:16.583
Fine.

1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:18.000
Have it your way.

1:39:18.750 --> 1:39:20.250
But I tried to be nice.

1:39:22.875 --> 1:39:24.375
You're not coming in this house.

1:39:24.875 --> 1:39:26.083
And I don't...

1:39:26.375 --> 1:39:27.208
want...

1:39:27.209 --> 1:39:28.375
to shoot you. Okay??

1:39:29.375 --> 1:39:30.375
Shit!!!!

1:39:30.376 --> 1:39:32.208
You're aiming sucks
and for all I know,

1:39:32.708 --> 1:39:34.542
You're probably out of bullets.

1:39:36.083 --> 1:39:37.208
I know what you're thinking.

1:39:37.583 --> 1:39:39.000
Have I shot 6 shots?

1:39:39.500 --> 1:39:40.875
Or have I shot 5???

1:39:43.375 --> 1:39:44.542
Shit!!!

1:39:45.250 --> 1:39:46.542
How many shots did I shoot?

1:39:48.417 --> 1:39:49.583
Game over man.

1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:55.541
I don't...

1:39:55.542 --> 1:39:56.667
want to hurt you.

1:39:59.042 --> 1:40:00.042
Goodbye Daryl.

1:40:01.250 --> 1:40:02.250
Oh fu...

1:40:11.250 --> 1:40:12.250
I'm sorry!

1:40:13.583 --> 1:40:14.583
Shit.

1:40:37.500 --> 1:40:39.625
Jesus fucking Christ Daryl!

1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:42.750
Keep it together,
keep it together.

1:40:56.583 --> 1:40:59.082
Oh right there... Oh.

1:40:59.083 --> 1:41:00.000
Yes!

1:41:00.001 --> 1:41:01.374
Oh!

1:41:01.375 --> 1:41:02.749
Yes!

1:41:02.750 --> 1:41:03.375
Yes!

1:41:03.375 --> 1:41:04.125
Oh!

1:41:04.125 --> 1:41:05.125
Oh!

1:41:05.458 --> 1:41:06.458
Oh!

1:41:06.625 --> 1:41:07.625
Oh!

1:41:08.083 --> 1:41:09.124
Mmmm...

1:41:09.125 --> 1:41:10.125
Oh yeah!

1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:11.500
Oh!

1:41:11.625 --> 1:41:12.542
Oh!!!

1:41:12.542 --> 1:41:13.542
Oh!!!!!!

1:41:13.625 --> 1:41:16.000
Oh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1:41:16.417 --> 1:41:18.167
Oh yes!!!!!

1:41:18.625 --> 1:41:19.625
Put my legs up.

1:41:21.167 --> 1:41:21.625
No no.

1:41:21.625 --> 1:41:22.625
Put them back down.

1:41:24.292 --> 1:41:25.292
Put your legs up!

1:41:26.125 --> 1:41:27.667
Yes!!!!

1:41:28.167 --> 1:41:29.417
Spin the other way...

1:41:30.583 --> 1:41:31.167
Oh!!

1:41:31.168 --> 1:41:34.333
Ahhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:39.167
What was that?

1:41:40.083 --> 1:41:41.333
Like 19 times?

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.667
Oh baby, thers gonna be more!

1:41:46.333 --> 1:41:48.250
What else could we possibly do?

1:41:49.583 --> 1:41:51.500
I have a surprise for you!

1:41:51.708 --> 1:41:52.708
Oh!

1:42:00.917 --> 1:42:02.375
Oh Richard!!!

1:42:04.208 --> 1:42:05.500
Surprise #1.

1:42:07.250 --> 1:42:08.708
Pucker up sweet cheeks!

1:42:13.875 --> 1:42:16.542
Now what in the fuck is that??

1:42:27.208 --> 1:42:28.500
Who you supposed to be?

1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:30.208
Little dead riding hood?

1:42:32.083 --> 1:42:33.083
I don't get the joke.

1:42:34.083 --> 1:42:35.708
The only funny thing
I saw tonight was...

1:42:36.417 --> 1:42:37.167
your friend

1:42:37.168 --> 1:42:38.250
setting off my Tannerite.

1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:40.042
Now that was funny!

1:42:41.542 --> 1:42:42.542
Man...

1:42:42.875 --> 1:42:45.500
Wish I had my security
camera setup to my DVR.

1:42:46.500 --> 1:42:48.583
I'm just happy
nobody's killed you yet.

1:42:49.250 --> 1:42:50.542
Well, that makes 2 of us.

1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.249
And now that we
agree on something,

1:42:52.250 --> 1:42:53.250
let's call it a night.

1:42:53.875 --> 1:42:54.667
Oh no.

1:42:54.668 --> 1:42:56.750
That just means I
get to kill you myself.

1:42:57.375 --> 1:42:59.375
Are you still mad
'cause I did't call?

1:43:01.667 --> 1:43:02.874
That was for fun.

1:43:02.875 --> 1:43:04.083
This is business.

1:43:05.083 --> 1:43:06.083
Come again?

1:43:06.750 --> 1:43:07.750
Not this round.

1:43:08.375 --> 1:43:09.083
This time...

1:43:09.083 --> 1:43:10.083
you gotta go!

1:43:14.875 --> 1:43:16.083
Bring it on sugar tits!

1:43:19.292 --> 1:43:20.292
Alright pops.

1:43:20.375 --> 1:43:21.416
But this time...

1:43:21.417 --> 1:43:23.125
we're playing for keeps.

1:43:36.250 --> 1:43:37.530
You know you're
not playing fair!

1:43:38.250 --> 1:43:39.542
I'd never hit a lady!

1:43:40.250 --> 1:43:41.625
Come on you fucking pussy!!

1:43:46.250 --> 1:43:47.582
Nothing pisses me off more

1:43:47.583 --> 1:43:48.707
than being treated like a woman

1:43:48.708 --> 1:43:50.082
who can't handle her shit!!

1:43:50.083 --> 1:43:51.207
I don't mean to offend,

1:43:51.208 --> 1:43:51.750
but...

1:43:51.751 --> 1:43:52.999
I'm old fashioned!

1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:54.332
And lucky for you,

1:43:54.333 --> 1:43:55.833
I'm getting tired of this shit!

1:44:03.792 --> 1:44:06.125
Well that wasn't very
gentleman like of you!

1:44:07.875 --> 1:44:08.875
I know.

1:44:09.542 --> 1:44:11.500
I usually don't do
head until the 2nd date.

1:44:11.792 --> 1:44:14.232
But things have always been
moving a little fast for you and
I.

1:44:14.750 --> 1:44:16.375
I'm not quite sure
how this counts.

1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:18.583
Let's just call it a 2nd date.

1:44:20.167 --> 1:44:23.082
Well, as stimulating as
this conversation has been,

1:44:23.083 --> 1:44:24.963
I'm gonna have to cut
things a little bit short.

1:44:26.333 --> 1:44:26.875
See...

1:44:27.208 --> 1:44:29.000
You have something
that belongs to us.

1:44:29.333 --> 1:44:31.208
And I think we'll be
taking it back now.

1:45:07.875 --> 1:45:09.000
Ahhh!!!!!

1:45:12.167 --> 1:45:13.167
Ahhh!!!!!

1:45:18.208 --> 1:45:20.083
Enjoy you're early
retirement Bill!

1:45:26.667 --> 1:45:27.750
God damnit!!!

1:45:28.250 --> 1:45:29.250
Keep pressure on it!!

1:45:55.750 --> 1:45:57.000
What a waste.

1:46:35.958 --> 1:46:36.625
Oh!

1:46:36.958 --> 1:46:37.958
Oh!!!!

1:46:38.333 --> 1:46:39.333
Oh!

1:46:39.375 --> 1:46:40.375
Oh!!!

1:46:40.458 --> 1:46:41.000
Oh!!!

1:46:41.458 --> 1:46:43.125
Oh!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1:46:45.542 --> 1:46:45.917
Hi.

1:46:45.918 --> 1:46:47.624
You've reached the voicemail
of Captain Richard Sully.

1:46:47.625 --> 1:46:48.125
Crap!!!

1:46:48.542 --> 1:46:50.342
I'm not available to
take your call right now.

1:46:50.625 --> 1:46:53.625
But please leave a message and I
will get back to you as soon as
possible.

1:46:53.875 --> 1:46:54.875
Thanks!

1:46:56.375 --> 1:46:57.375
Captain Sully!

1:46:58.000 --> 1:46:59.000
It's Bill!!

1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:01.625
Got some shit going
down at my house.

1:47:05.875 --> 1:47:07.000
Looks like cops!

1:47:11.708 --> 1:47:12.250
I...

1:47:12.251 --> 1:47:13.583
I recognize one of them as...

1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:16.167
Jax Maxwell.

1:47:25.500 --> 1:47:26.875
You're the only one I trust.

1:47:27.708 --> 1:47:29.625
Get your ass down here
as soon as you get this!

1:47:29.875 --> 1:47:31.125
And hurry the fuck up!

1:47:40.875 --> 1:47:42.083
Fuckin' dick!

1:48:03.750 --> 1:48:05.000
Let's play some more!

1:48:21.083 --> 1:48:21.583
What?

1:48:21.875 --> 1:48:23.875
You thought sneaking
up on me I'd be shocked?

1:48:25.250 --> 1:48:26.370
You wanna start some static?

1:48:44.833 --> 1:48:45.958
You wanna play with knives?

1:49:28.458 --> 1:49:30.333
I got nothin' on that!

1:50:05.750 --> 1:50:07.000
Missed call from Bill?

1:50:07.375 --> 1:50:09.055
What in the hell does
he want at this hour?

1:50:09.083 --> 1:50:10.000
Who cares??

1:50:10.001 --> 1:50:11.500
Get your tush back over here!

1:50:12.208 --> 1:50:14.583
Just a minute Marge,
this could be important.

1:50:15.625 --> 1:50:17.416
Oh Richard!!

1:50:17.417 --> 1:50:19.542
I said just a minute!

1:50:24.500 --> 1:50:25.708
Where's the other butt plug?

1:50:27.042 --> 1:50:28.875
Your turn!!!

1:50:30.875 --> 1:50:35.208
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1:50:36.583 --> 1:50:38.167
Ahhhh!?!?!?

1:50:39.083 --> 1:50:40.582
Oh...

1:50:40.583 --> 1:50:42.042
yeah!!!!!

1:50:56.917 --> 1:50:58.167
Sorry Bill.

1:50:58.500 --> 1:50:59.917
He got the drop on me.

1:51:06.042 --> 1:51:07.250
Drop your weapon...

1:51:08.083 --> 1:51:09.250
or I'll shoot him.

1:51:09.875 --> 1:51:10.875
Alright.

1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:12.000
Take it easy.

1:51:12.667 --> 1:51:13.667
Nobody needs to get hurt.

1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:23.000
I'm unarmed.

1:51:24.667 --> 1:51:25.827
I've waited all day for this.

1:51:26.667 --> 1:51:27.667
Who are you?

1:51:28.875 --> 1:51:30.500
I see you managed
to take out my men.

1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:33.708
You picked the
wrong house buddy.

1:51:34.875 --> 1:51:35.875
I'm not your buddy.

1:51:36.875 --> 1:51:38.000
I'm your worst nightmare!

1:51:38.542 --> 1:51:39.542
Hey!

1:51:40.375 --> 1:51:41.875
What the hell's
wrong with this thing?

1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:48.250
I'm your worst nightmare!

1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:50.124
And tonight...

1:51:50.125 --> 1:51:51.667
I will Purge you from existance!

1:51:52.375 --> 1:51:53.500
What's with the disguise?

1:51:54.750 --> 1:51:56.167
You affraid to face
me like a man?

1:51:57.125 --> 1:51:58.125
What?

1:51:58.292 --> 1:51:59.292
Are you a coward?

1:51:59.667 --> 1:52:00.827
I'll show you who's a coward!

1:52:02.750 --> 1:52:04.042
You'll beg me to spare your life

1:52:04.333 --> 1:52:06.083
after you watch me carve up

1:52:06.458 --> 1:52:08.208
each and every person you love

1:52:08.458 --> 1:52:09.582
into itty

1:52:09.583 --> 1:52:10.208
bitty

1:52:10.208 --> 1:52:10.750
pieces!

1:52:10.751 --> 1:52:11.958
Shit!!!

1:52:12.750 --> 1:52:14.270
What the hell is
wrong with this thing?

1:52:15.958 --> 1:52:17.375
Why doesn't anything
go as planned?

1:52:17.833 --> 1:52:18.833
Aidan?

1:52:19.125 --> 1:52:20.250
Aidan is that you???

1:52:20.750 --> 1:52:21.750
Shut up!!

1:52:29.750 --> 1:52:30.375
Aidan!!!

1:52:30.625 --> 1:52:31.875
What in the hell are you doing?

1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.000
I don't need a mask.

1:52:37.667 --> 1:52:38.667
No more hiding.

1:52:39.208 --> 1:52:40.375
Aidan we're partners!!!

1:52:41.083 --> 1:52:42.083
I'm not your partner!

1:52:43.750 --> 1:52:44.750
I'm not your friend!

1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:47.000
You...

1:52:47.083 --> 1:52:47.708
Daryl,

1:52:48.083 --> 1:52:49.083
your family.

1:52:50.208 --> 1:52:52.128
You're everything that's
wrong with this country!

1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:54.500
You're the reason this
country needs the Purge!

1:52:55.833 --> 1:52:56.833
And I'm gonna enjoy...

1:52:57.083 --> 1:52:58.208
every last minute of it.

1:52:59.250 --> 1:53:00.250
Aidan,

1:53:00.417 --> 1:53:01.697
It doesn't have to end this way.

1:53:02.125 --> 1:53:03.250
You can just walk away.

1:53:03.750 --> 1:53:04.750
No!!

1:53:06.250 --> 1:53:07.875
It definitely has
to end this way!

1:53:09.542 --> 1:53:11.250
I'm not gonna walk
away empty handed.

1:53:12.083 --> 1:53:13.374
What do you want from me Aidan?

1:53:13.375 --> 1:53:14.583
What's this all about?

1:53:16.083 --> 1:53:17.667
Like I told you before...

1:53:18.708 --> 1:53:20.000
Word on the street is...

1:53:21.083 --> 1:53:22.375
you had a big bust.

1:53:23.208 --> 1:53:24.667
Scored a hefty chunk of change.

1:53:27.208 --> 1:53:28.582
Log books say...

1:53:28.583 --> 1:53:29.875
1.4 million

1:53:30.375 --> 1:53:31.375
placed into evidence.

1:53:32.750 --> 1:53:34.083
But we checked the boxes.

1:53:34.708 --> 1:53:35.708
There's no money.

1:53:37.083 --> 1:53:38.083
So my thought is...

1:53:39.500 --> 1:53:41.708
you added yourself a little
bonus to your retirement.

1:53:43.042 --> 1:53:44.416
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1:53:44.417 --> 1:53:45.417
I didn't take any money.

1:53:46.417 --> 1:53:47.583
Tell me where the money is...

1:53:50.875 --> 1:53:52.374
or I'm gonna start peeling them

1:53:52.375 --> 1:53:53.583
one by one

1:53:54.500 --> 1:53:55.667
until you do.

1:53:57.500 --> 1:53:58.500
I told you

1:53:58.583 --> 1:54:00.750
I don't know anything
about any money,

1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:03.000
Okay.

1:54:03.750 --> 1:54:04.750
You want games.

1:54:06.417 --> 1:54:07.667
Let's play games.

1:54:09.250 --> 1:54:10.500
I'll find the money.

1:54:12.875 --> 1:54:14.000
To be totally honest,

1:54:14.583 --> 1:54:16.263
I was planning on
killing everybody anyway.

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.083
Seeing as how I can
be a generous guy,

1:54:23.917 --> 1:54:25.875
I'm gonna let you
pick who dies first.

1:54:27.625 --> 1:54:28.792
So who's it gonna be?

1:54:30.375 --> 1:54:31.750
The pretty little niece?

1:54:35.917 --> 1:54:37.167
Tell me my love...

1:54:38.250 --> 1:54:38.875
How do you like it?

1:54:38.876 --> 1:54:40.042
Get your hands off her!!

1:54:40.625 --> 1:54:41.625
Fast?

1:54:42.292 --> 1:54:43.375
Slow?

1:54:45.125 --> 1:54:48.125
Maybe your little nephew
wants to volunteer.

1:54:49.292 --> 1:54:50.292
Get off me!

1:54:50.958 --> 1:54:53.958
Do you want to be
tonights first little sacrifice?

1:54:55.708 --> 1:54:56.708
Uh oh!

1:54:58.833 --> 1:55:00.333
Looks like we had
a little accident.

1:55:04.083 --> 1:55:05.624
Should have worn
the yellow pants.

1:55:05.625 --> 1:55:06.625
Fuck you!!

1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.250
Now you have Pee-Jay's!

1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.082
Awe fuck it!

1:55:24.083 --> 1:55:25.083
We're out of time.

1:55:26.375 --> 1:55:27.375
I guess

1:55:27.583 --> 1:55:29.583
I'm just gonna have
to choose for you Bill.

1:55:30.833 --> 1:55:32.207
I like to keep it classy

1:55:32.208 --> 1:55:33.583
being a gentlemen and all.

1:55:34.167 --> 1:55:35.167
So...

1:55:36.667 --> 1:55:37.000
No!!!!

1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:38.000
Ladies first!

1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:38.500
Wait!!!

1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:40.000
Well?

1:55:40.708 --> 1:55:42.708
You gonna tell
me who dies first?

1:55:44.208 --> 1:55:45.583
Or where the money is?

1:55:46.333 --> 1:55:47.833
I've decided who dies first.

1:55:48.875 --> 1:55:49.875
Well?

1:55:50.250 --> 1:55:50.792
You...

1:55:50.792 --> 1:55:51.792
Dickhead!

1:56:34.583 --> 1:56:35.583
Everybody alright?

1:56:36.083 --> 1:56:36.542
Yeah I think so.

1:56:36.542 --> 1:56:37.542
Everybody okay?

1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:39.680
It would be nice to
get out of these cuffs.

1:56:40.250 --> 1:56:41.500
I got to give it to you Bill.

1:56:42.875 --> 1:56:43.875
I didn't see that coming.

1:56:44.750 --> 1:56:45.750
Where's grandma?

1:56:47.375 --> 1:56:48.583
Knowing my men,

1:56:50.250 --> 1:56:51.417
They gutted her already.

1:56:52.375 --> 1:56:53.750
You son of a bitch!!

1:56:54.417 --> 1:56:56.017
You're not gonna walk
away from this one!

1:57:01.167 --> 1:57:02.167
Well.

1:57:02.917 --> 1:57:04.083
Saved by the bell.

1:57:05.583 --> 1:57:07.083
Look's like it's
too late for you.

1:57:15.250 --> 1:57:16.250
God damn!

1:57:16.750 --> 1:57:17.750
That shit hurts!

1:57:20.250 --> 1:57:21.416
That was a close one!

1:57:21.417 --> 1:57:23.125
You're not gonna
get away with this.

1:57:24.542 --> 1:57:25.625
It's too late buddy.

1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:28.000
The Purge is over.

1:57:29.375 --> 1:57:31.735
Should have packed something
a little bit bigger down there.

1:57:34.917 --> 1:57:35.917
See you at work.

1:57:44.583 --> 1:57:45.583
Captain!

1:57:45.958 --> 1:57:47.208
Hey, is everybody okay?

1:57:47.625 --> 1:57:48.708
That was a close one!

1:57:49.583 --> 1:57:51.082
Hey buddy, I'm sorry
I missed your call.

1:57:51.083 --> 1:57:54.458
But all emergency services were
down and I got here as quick as
I could.

1:57:54.875 --> 1:57:55.875
Just in time.

1:57:56.167 --> 1:57:57.167
You saved my ass.

1:57:59.167 --> 1:58:00.167
Are you okay?

1:58:00.917 --> 1:58:01.417
Huh?

1:58:01.875 --> 1:58:02.417
No.

1:58:02.418 --> 1:58:05.417
No, I think I might have slipped
somehting in my lower back.

1:58:05.667 --> 1:58:06.667
I'll be okay.

1:58:07.167 --> 1:58:08.624
Hey, thats quite a
mess you made outside.

1:58:08.625 --> 1:58:10.375
Looks like you
had quite a night.

1:58:11.167 --> 1:58:12.083
My partner...

1:58:12.084 --> 1:58:13.167
who you just took out..

1:58:13.708 --> 1:58:15.208
And a group of his friends,

1:58:15.833 --> 1:58:18.083
appear to be from the
State police task force.

1:58:19.833 --> 1:58:22.500
And the rest I suspect
work for the agency.

1:58:23.708 --> 1:58:24.833
Oh yeah...

1:58:25.083 --> 1:58:27.000
It's too bad about
Sasha and Jax.

1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:29.320
Did they get what
they were after?

1:58:29.583 --> 1:58:31.375
Well, Daryl and
I are still alive.

1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.083
Although he's gonna wake
up with a mighty headache.

1:58:34.792 --> 1:58:35.872
So I'm gonna have to say...

1:58:36.125 --> 1:58:37.542
They did not
complete their mission.

1:58:38.375 --> 1:58:39.250
So...

1:58:39.251 --> 1:58:40.291
they didn't get the money.

1:58:41.625 --> 1:58:42.625
The money?

1:58:43.042 --> 1:58:44.042
Yeah!

1:58:44.208 --> 1:58:45.750
The money from the Velasco bust!

1:58:46.708 --> 1:58:48.167
That's what they
came here for right?

1:58:49.375 --> 1:58:50.895
I assume you stashed
it somewhere safe.

1:58:51.875 --> 1:58:53.375
I never said anything
about any money.

1:58:54.208 --> 1:58:56.166
Yes you did, in your voicemail.

1:58:56.167 --> 1:58:59.374
You told me that Aidan was here

1:58:59.375 --> 1:59:01.583
with his men and
to get the money.

1:59:02.375 --> 1:59:03.750
I never said it was Aidan.

1:59:04.208 --> 1:59:06.082
He didn't take
his mask off until

1:59:06.083 --> 1:59:07.167
well into this.

1:59:08.875 --> 1:59:09.708
Damnit Bill.

1:59:09.709 --> 1:59:11.249
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

1:59:11.250 --> 1:59:12.667
Put your hands behind your head.

1:59:15.292 --> 1:59:16.917
Now turn around
and get on your knees.

1:59:28.500 --> 1:59:30.460
You know I tried to get
you away from all of this?

1:59:30.917 --> 1:59:31.875
All you had to do

1:59:31.876 --> 1:59:34.250
was finish your last
2 weeks in FIRE.

1:59:36.250 --> 1:59:37.875
Where's my million dollars?

1:59:40.250 --> 1:59:40.750
It's...

1:59:41.083 --> 1:59:42.083
1...

1:59:42.250 --> 1:59:43.000
point...

1:59:43.250 --> 1:59:44.250
4...

1:59:44.542 --> 1:59:45.542
million...

1:59:48.042 --> 1:59:50.250
Jesus Christ!!!

1:59:50.750 --> 1:59:51.750
Boss.

1:59:52.125 --> 1:59:54.833
Will you please shut the
fuck up and die already?

2:00:03.125 --> 2:00:04.500
So where's my 1 point...

2:00:05.125 --> 2:00:06.250
4 million dollars???

2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:08.240
Why are you doing this Captain?

2:00:10.292 --> 2:00:12.750
You think I'm going to walk
away from this agency...

2:00:13.042 --> 2:00:15.667
with that shitty retirement
salary they're gonna give me?

2:00:17.250 --> 2:00:18.375
You know I gave my life...

2:00:18.917 --> 2:00:21.375
gave 30 years of
my life to this shithole!

2:00:22.375 --> 2:00:24.750
I knew that Velasco
bust would be a big take.

2:00:25.208 --> 2:00:27.332
It was just enough
to set me up nicely

2:00:27.333 --> 2:00:29.333
where no one would
even know it's gone.

2:00:30.458 --> 2:00:33.458
All you had to do was allow
my men to take the money.

2:00:34.583 --> 2:00:35.208
Hell...

2:00:35.209 --> 2:00:36.249
I would have cut you in.

2:00:36.250 --> 2:00:38.458
But I knew that you were
too much of a good old boy.

2:00:41.042 --> 2:00:43.417
But you just had to
process the scene.

2:00:44.792 --> 2:00:45.792
I'll find the money.

2:00:46.792 --> 2:00:49.125
But I'm affraid I can't
leave any loose ends.

2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:51.000
What??

2:00:53.792 --> 2:00:55.750
Well I may just
have to call this in.

2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:57.042
Let's see what I've got...

2:00:58.375 --> 2:00:59.666
1 agent down.

2:00:59.667 --> 2:01:00.667
Maybe uh...

2:01:00.875 --> 2:01:02.208
6 other casualties?

2:01:03.167 --> 2:01:05.500
Hey, you know your
voicemail was the perfect alibi.

2:01:05.875 --> 2:01:07.875
Unfortunately by the
time I arrived here,

2:01:08.208 --> 2:01:09.708
Aidan had killed everyone.

2:01:10.833 --> 2:01:12.082
And we all know...

2:01:12.083 --> 2:01:15.583
that killing after the 2nd
Purge Siren is illegal!!

2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.167
Aidan certainly has
nothing to say about it.

2:01:18.708 --> 2:01:20.833
I shot him just before
he drew down on me.

2:01:22.042 --> 2:01:24.208
There's a reason why
I made it to the top Bill.

2:01:25.042 --> 2:01:26.249
You're not on the top.

2:01:26.250 --> 2:01:27.750
You're still 2nd in command.

2:01:28.125 --> 2:01:29.541
Oh, you didn't hear?

2:01:29.542 --> 2:01:31.208
I got a promotion last night!

2:01:32.083 --> 2:01:35.707
Let's just say that Director
Johnson has unexpectedly...

2:01:35.708 --> 2:01:37.000
been relieved of duty.

2:01:37.583 --> 2:01:40.000
So that's your method
of upward mobility?

2:01:40.708 --> 2:01:44.208
If maybe you followed my lead
instead of always playing by the
book...

2:01:44.583 --> 2:01:46.042
you would have
been my successor.

2:01:49.042 --> 2:01:50.042
I'm sorry,

2:01:50.083 --> 2:01:52.375
but your dedication
has got you killed Bill.

2:01:55.708 --> 2:01:56.208
No, no, no!

2:01:56.208 --> 2:01:57.208
No!

2:02:14.917 --> 2:02:16.250
Grandma!?!?!?

2:02:17.500 --> 2:02:18.500
What??

2:02:18.583 --> 2:02:19.583
You were missing!

2:02:19.917 --> 2:02:21.500
We thought you might be dead!

2:02:21.750 --> 2:02:22.500
Nah!!

2:02:22.501 --> 2:02:24.000
Fell asleep on the crapper.

2:02:24.375 --> 2:02:26.417
Woke up to the sound
of the Purge siren.

2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:28.374
From the looks of things,

2:02:28.375 --> 2:02:30.375
just in time to get my Purge on!

2:02:32.583 --> 2:02:33.583
Ma,

2:02:33.875 --> 2:02:35.375
That was the second siren.

2:02:36.167 --> 2:02:37.167
The Purge...

2:02:37.500 --> 2:02:38.500
was over.

2:02:39.125 --> 2:02:40.125
Oops!

2:02:40.708 --> 2:02:41.333
Well,

2:02:41.334 --> 2:02:42.625
I won't tell if you won't!

2:02:43.208 --> 2:02:43.708
Now,

2:02:44.042 --> 2:02:45.500
who wants pancakes???

2:03:05.167 --> 2:03:06.666
Kids, are you okay?

2:03:06.667 --> 2:03:07.917
You okay?

2:03:09.292 --> 2:03:10.875
You're okay.

2:03:12.833 --> 2:03:13.833
You'll be okay.

2:03:22.375 --> 2:03:23.624
Come on, let's see if he's okay.

2:03:23.625 --> 2:03:24.833
Let's get him rolled over.

2:03:31.875 --> 2:03:32.542
Daryl!

2:03:32.875 --> 2:03:33.542
Daryl!

2:03:33.542 --> 2:03:34.542
Daryl!

2:03:34.625 --> 2:03:35.250
Daryl!

2:03:35.500 --> 2:03:36.625
Hey buddy, wake up!

2:03:40.667 --> 2:03:41.667
You're alive!

2:03:42.625 --> 2:03:43.625
Jenna?

2:03:44.292 --> 2:03:45.417
Is this heaven?

2:03:45.708 --> 2:03:46.832
He's alive!

2:03:46.833 --> 2:03:47.833
Hey bro!

2:03:49.583 --> 2:03:50.583
Bill?

2:03:51.708 --> 2:03:52.708
Are we all dead?

2:03:53.500 --> 2:03:54.500
Not yet.

2:03:54.833 --> 2:03:56.083
Let me help you up.

2:04:02.208 --> 2:04:03.208
Man...

2:04:03.875 --> 2:04:06.708
the last thing I remember
I was about to be purged.

2:04:07.792 --> 2:04:08.792
Then I heard...

2:04:09.042 --> 2:04:10.125
Aidan's voice?

2:04:11.542 --> 2:04:12.542
Captain Sully?

2:04:14.042 --> 2:04:15.125
What the hell happened?

2:04:15.750 --> 2:04:17.125
It's a long tale bro.

2:04:18.500 --> 2:04:19.000
Come on,

2:04:19.001 --> 2:04:20.161
let's get you some fresh air.

2:04:20.583 --> 2:04:22.375
Besides, my back
teeth are floating.

2:04:28.875 --> 2:04:29.875
What was that for?

2:04:30.083 --> 2:04:31.083
For being my hero.

2:04:32.208 --> 2:04:33.208
Hero?

2:04:33.500 --> 2:04:33.875
Yeah.

2:04:33.876 --> 2:04:36.499
If you weren't here at the
right time and the right place

2:04:36.500 --> 2:04:38.208
those men could have
came in and killed us.

2:04:38.875 --> 2:04:40.583
You protected my family and me.

2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:43.200
And I think you're pretty hot.

2:04:43.750 --> 2:04:45.375
Even though you work for ICE.

2:04:46.167 --> 2:04:47.167
Well...

2:04:47.375 --> 2:04:48.416
you're not so bad yourself.

2:04:48.417 --> 2:04:50.542
Shut up and kiss me back
before I change my mind!

2:04:51.417 --> 2:04:52.417
Yes ma'am.

2:05:00.750 --> 2:05:02.083
You should go
get that fresh air!

2:05:03.667 --> 2:05:04.375
But!

2:05:04.376 --> 2:05:06.336
You should take me to
breakfast when you get back.

2:05:07.250 --> 2:05:08.000
Take you out?

2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:08.750
Like on a date?

2:05:08.750 --> 2:05:09.542
Yeah!

2:05:09.543 --> 2:05:10.743
You think you can handle that?

2:05:11.750 --> 2:05:13.000
I think I can manage.

2:05:13.250 --> 2:05:13.750
But,

2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:17.583
I'm not from around here so
you might have to pick the
place.

2:05:17.917 --> 2:05:19.083
Alright, umm...

2:05:19.875 --> 2:05:21.082
what about Westley's Diner?

2:05:21.083 --> 2:05:22.083
It's by the gas station.

2:05:22.917 --> 2:05:23.917
Westley's huh?

2:05:24.250 --> 2:05:26.167
Or if you would prefer
Buttercup Pantry?

2:05:27.458 --> 2:05:28.458
As you wish...

2:05:29.458 --> 2:05:30.458
What?

2:05:31.375 --> 2:05:32.500
Marriage!!!

2:05:33.042 --> 2:05:34.249
Marriage!

2:05:34.250 --> 2:05:35.666
Is what brings us...

2:05:35.667 --> 2:05:37.041
together...

2:05:37.042 --> 2:05:38.125
today!!!

2:05:39.250 --> 2:05:40.374
Let's slow down there okay?

2:05:40.375 --> 2:05:43.250
Let's just start with sharing
some sausage and eggs first!

2:05:43.625 --> 2:05:44.375
It's...

2:05:44.376 --> 2:05:45.875
from The Princess Bride!

2:05:46.500 --> 2:05:46.875
You know?

2:05:46.876 --> 2:05:48.000
Westley and Buttercup?

2:05:50.375 --> 2:05:51.416
No...

2:05:51.417 --> 2:05:52.417
Go get your fresh air.

2:05:52.875 --> 2:05:53.875
Come back to me though.

2:05:53.875 --> 2:05:54.625
Promise?

2:05:54.625 --> 2:05:55.250
Okay.

2:05:55.250 --> 2:05:55.875
But,

2:05:55.875 --> 2:05:56.875
sausage and eggs!

2:05:57.250 --> 2:05:58.250
Sounds cool!

2:05:58.500 --> 2:06:00.249
I like to flip it
over easy and...

2:06:00.250 --> 2:06:01.250
dip it in the yolk!

2:06:02.500 --> 2:06:03.500
Go!

2:06:07.833 --> 2:06:10.073
Well, look's like she's getting
the ride along before me.

2:06:10.708 --> 2:06:11.583
Brian!

2:06:11.584 --> 2:06:13.583
That's no way to
talk about your sister!

2:06:15.167 --> 2:06:17.041
And you need to
get out of those...

2:06:17.042 --> 2:06:18.042
Pee-Jays!

2:06:18.125 --> 2:06:18.792
Yeah...

2:06:18.792 --> 2:06:19.792
Hmm...

2:06:23.417 --> 2:06:25.499
Who did he say is riding who?

2:06:25.500 --> 2:06:27.999
Oh, nothing dear.

2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.125
We need to get
you a hearing aid!

2:06:30.875 --> 2:06:32.625
First batch coming up!!

2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:34.708
Come on.

2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:36.375
Let's get you some pancakes.

2:06:36.708 --> 2:06:37.708
Me lady!

2:06:40.583 --> 2:06:42.499
Mmm that smells amazing!

2:06:42.500 --> 2:06:43.500
Enjoy!

2:06:44.083 --> 2:06:44.583
Yummy!

2:06:44.833 --> 2:06:45.583
Bon appétit!

2:06:45.833 --> 2:06:46.833
Thank you!

2:06:47.375 --> 2:06:49.000
And the big one's for me!

2:07:27.375 --> 2:07:28.655
That's a lot of
dead people Bill!

2:07:29.667 --> 2:07:30.667
Told ya...

2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:32.000
it's a long story.

2:07:38.125 --> 2:07:39.583
Thanks for having me over!

2:07:40.750 --> 2:07:41.750
You're right,

2:07:42.750 --> 2:07:44.249
I don't think I would
have survived the night

2:07:44.250 --> 2:07:45.730
if all of those guys
came to my house.

2:07:50.375 --> 2:07:51.375
Well,

2:07:51.583 --> 2:07:52.583
to be honest,

2:07:54.583 --> 2:07:57.250
I don't think my family
would have survived if you
hadn't been here.

2:07:58.542 --> 2:07:59.875
I want to thank you for that.

2:08:23.750 --> 2:08:27.125
Timber!!!!!!!

2:08:28.375 --> 2:08:29.625
You've got wood!!

2:08:43.500 --> 2:08:46.792
Timber!!!!!!!

2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:49.000
Alight!!!

2:08:52.833 --> 2:08:53.833
You know uh...

2:08:53.958 --> 2:08:54.958
speaking of family...

2:08:56.250 --> 2:08:57.125
I'm gonna uh...

2:08:57.126 --> 2:08:59.125
take you're niece
out to breakfast later.

2:08:59.875 --> 2:09:00.875
Her and I have a...

2:09:02.292 --> 2:09:03.292
real connection!

2:09:04.417 --> 2:09:05.750
She wants to do a ride along.

2:09:06.917 --> 2:09:07.917
And...

2:09:08.625 --> 2:09:09.625
by ride along...

2:09:09.875 --> 2:09:11.042
I mean intercourse!

2:09:13.375 --> 2:09:14.625
We'll talk about that later!

2:09:15.250 --> 2:09:17.625
And we'll see how she feels
about it when she's sober!

2:09:19.833 --> 2:09:20.833
Your uhh...

2:09:21.583 --> 2:09:23.332
nephew Brian seems cool too!

2:09:23.333 --> 2:09:24.999
He also wants
to do a ride along!

2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:25.583
Excuse me??

2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:27.000
Uhh...

2:09:27.750 --> 2:09:28.750
That came out wrong.

2:09:30.583 --> 2:09:31.583
Yes it did!

2:09:36.667 --> 2:09:37.875
You break her heart,

2:09:38.333 --> 2:09:40.208
I break your dick!

2:09:41.750 --> 2:09:42.750
I...

2:09:43.375 --> 2:09:44.375
I don't want that!

2:09:45.542 --> 2:09:46.750
Just fucking with you bro!

2:09:48.625 --> 2:09:49.625
Ohh huh...

2:09:50.042 --> 2:09:50.375
Ooh...

2:09:50.375 --> 2:09:51.375
We're good!

2:09:56.042 --> 2:09:57.042
Bill,

2:09:57.375 --> 2:09:59.375
you're not such
a bad guy after all.

2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:02.760
I don't care what all
those other people say!

2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:07.000
Nah...

2:10:07.583 --> 2:10:08.875
you're not so bad yourself!

2:10:10.583 --> 2:10:11.708
Even though you're ICE!

2:10:15.208 --> 2:10:16.375
You know,

2:10:17.542 --> 2:10:18.708
I may have been wrong.

2:10:19.708 --> 2:10:21.583
Maybe FIRE and ICE can mix.

2:10:23.250 --> 2:10:23.917
Hmm...

2:10:23.917 --> 2:10:24.917
FIRE...

2:10:25.875 --> 2:10:26.875
ICE...

2:10:30.875 --> 2:10:32.083
You wanna?

2:10:38.750 --> 2:10:39.750
What the hell!

2:10:42.500 --> 2:10:43.500
Whoa!!!
