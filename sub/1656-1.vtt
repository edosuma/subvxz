00:37.120 --> 00:40.082
If you like stories about chance
and coincidence and fate...

00:41.208 --> 00:42.709
...then here's one you've never heard.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.128
Boy meets girl...

00:48.423 --> 00:52.135
Girl almost kills boy
by running a red light at rush hour.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.306
Boy is T-boned at over 60 miles per hour...

01:01.311 --> 01:02.646
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

01:03.188 --> 01:04.313
Uh-huh.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.692
...and survives with barely a scratch.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.277
Are you drunk?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.573
Not anymore.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.658
Is that cocaine on your nose?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.910
Between the bottle and the sports book,

01:17.828 --> 01:20.789
boy had lost his way in the City of Angels.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.083
Until he found one.

01:24.001 --> 01:27.546
The one he's been looking for his entire life.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.715
I'm sorry, I didn't see the light.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.633
Well, don't go towards it now.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.511
Boy falls in love in that second,

01:34.595 --> 01:37.347
and knows his luck is about to change.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.645
Baby, cum.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.692
Cum, baby, cum on me.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.235
What a difference a year makes...

01:51.528 --> 01:54.198
...off the bottle and the blow,

01:54.239 --> 01:55.616
high on life itself.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.036
And about to put a ring on this girl's finger.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.871
-That felt good, baby.
-Oh, my God, so good.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.956
-Are you happy?
-Yeah, I'm so happy.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.501
I'm breaking up with you.

02:06.752 --> 02:07.836
Yeah.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.670
I've met someone, right?

02:09.713 --> 02:12.549
And... And I fell really hard for him
and I didn't expect it to happen,

02:12.591 --> 02:15.636
but now that it has, I just feel like
I can't ignore my feelings any longer.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.720
Candice,

02:18.055 --> 02:19.890
I just came.

02:19.932 --> 02:20.933
I know.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.643
I know and so did I.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.188
Are you shitting me?

02:26.563 --> 02:27.940
I wanted you to feel euphoric.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.777
It didn't work!

02:34.071 --> 02:35.239
And after that,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.574
everything pretty much went to shit.

02:38.534 --> 02:41.828
What a difference another fucking year makes.

02:41.912 --> 02:46.542
She'd dumped me for the starting
quarterback of the Cleveland Browns.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.586
His signing bonus was 4.5 million,

02:49.670 --> 02:52.631
my last check was for 816...

02:53.423 --> 02:54.675
...dollars.

02:54.758 --> 02:59.137
And I still sit here like an asshole and wonder
if I could've done something different?

03:01.265 --> 03:03.016
She devastated me.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.936
She knocked my dick in the dirt.

03:07.646 --> 03:08.897
She took my steam.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.441
My mojo...

03:13.277 --> 03:16.738
And I gotta get it back
because this is killing me!

03:17.781 --> 03:21.118
I mean, what the fuck am I doing?

03:22.327 --> 03:23.328
Fuck!

03:24.746 --> 03:26.832
I came to LA to be an actor.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.126
Uh, hi, I'm Kevin Briyzowski.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.252
Next.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.837
What's up, I'm Kevin Brizow.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.921
Next.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.757
I'm Kai Bravo.

03:37.676 --> 03:37.759
And now, I drive a limo.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.346
And, shocker, I hate it.

03:42.806 --> 03:43.640
I hate the hours...

03:45.434 --> 03:46.143
I hate the clients...

03:48.645 --> 03:50.522
And, fuck me, I hate my life.

03:52.733 --> 03:52.816
I gotta get my shit together.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.028
I know I do.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.075
My life is nearly half over
and I have exactly jack shit to show for it.

04:03.160 --> 04:03.243
No money...

04:05.996 --> 04:07.497
No power...

04:09.249 --> 04:09.541
...and no women.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.839
And in this town, I am fucking positive
that's the order they come in.

04:19.009 --> 04:19.343
Better men would've blown
their heads off by now.

04:20.719 --> 04:20.802
Men like Karl with a "K."

04:22.137 --> 04:22.179
Hi, I'm Karl...

04:23.639 --> 04:23.680
That's how he introduced himself.

04:24.890 --> 04:25.349
...with a "K."

04:27.809 --> 04:29.728
Karl with a "K" was legendary.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.233
Karl with a "K" lived to serve.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.238
Karl with a "K"
was the industry gold standard.

04:43.367 --> 04:43.408
Do you like dry two olive
Bombay martinis with a shot of Chambord?

04:44.701 --> 04:45.285
Karl with a "K" knows you do.

04:46.578 --> 04:46.662
-Loose.
-Yeah.

04:47.746 --> 04:47.829
-See that?
-Okay. Okay.

04:50.207 --> 04:50.290
-Just, no tension.
-I see it now.

04:51.834 --> 04:51.875
-Costa Rica...
-Aruba.

04:56.046 --> 04:56.129
Karl with a "K" was trim,
worldly and well-traveled.

04:58.882 --> 04:58.966
You know, I actually did
an Ironman Triathlon in Panama.

04:59.967 --> 05:00.050
Wow.

05:01.051 --> 05:01.093
To Karl with a "K"...

05:03.345 --> 05:03.387
All right, Norman, I think I got
everything out of the bathroom.

05:04.471 --> 05:04.555
...it was about the client.

05:06.932 --> 05:07.015
Quick question. Is that a severed penis?

05:08.642 --> 05:08.725
Always about the client.

05:09.726 --> 05:09.852
Yes, sir.

05:12.896 --> 05:13.397
Some chilled Veuve Clicquot
for the returning honeymooners.

05:14.398 --> 05:14.481
Thank you.

05:19.403 --> 05:19.528
Karl with a "K" was quite simply
the personification of total client satisfaction.

05:21.071 --> 05:21.738
-What about her?
-She's dead.

05:24.324 --> 05:24.408
But, uh, I got you a blueberry muffin.
It's on the seat.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.537
Oh! You're the greatest, Karl.

05:33.083 --> 05:33.125
I am sure his sterling reputation
thrilled Karl with a "K" to no end...

05:34.168 --> 05:34.251
Wow.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.216
You guys look so happy.

05:46.346 --> 05:46.430
...right up until the day
he sucked on a .38 snub nose.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.477
It would mark the only time in nearly 20 years
that someone else would clean his limo.

05:55.189 --> 05:55.898
Jesus, they buried him in one of those.

05:59.443 --> 05:59.693
I heard later that Karl
had come to LA to be an actor.

06:01.612 --> 06:02.154
But I cannot go out like that.

06:04.239 --> 06:04.281
I don't even believe in fate,

06:07.618 --> 06:07.701
only in the destiny that you make for yourself.

06:12.456 --> 06:12.497
The only reason I am in this hole
is because I couldn't stop digging.

06:14.458 --> 06:14.541
But that has to change.

06:18.295 --> 06:18.378
Starting today, this fucking minute,

06:21.673 --> 06:29.673
I am putting the goddamn shovel down.

06:50.369 --> 06:50.786
Yes, indeed.

06:52.663 --> 06:52.746
What's up, babe? What's with these guys?

06:54.748 --> 06:54.831
Naseem wants you front and center, homie.

06:55.916 --> 06:55.999
He taking heads?

06:59.169 --> 06:59.837
Not yet, but whatever fears you have
are totally founded.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.257
Oh, no.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.301
-Oh, come on.
-What?

07:07.845 --> 07:08.011
-Jesus.
-What? What are you doing?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.097
Look at you.

07:11.807 --> 07:12.516
-You're a disaster.
-Okay.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.059
I can't...

07:15.477 --> 07:15.894
Who gains weight in their neck?

07:17.104 --> 07:17.187
Sexy people.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.023
Smartass.

07:21.525 --> 07:21.567
You look like a slob.

07:23.360 --> 07:23.694
And you look like desert camo.

07:24.862 --> 07:24.945
That's what I'm going for.

07:27.072 --> 07:27.155
Wait, you just disappeared in that chair.
I can only see your head.

07:28.156 --> 07:28.198
You're funny.

07:29.700 --> 07:29.783
You think I'm gonna get axed?

07:32.119 --> 07:32.202
Since you seem
to actively want to lose this job?

07:33.537 --> 07:33.579
-Yeah.
-I don't know, maybe...

07:36.164 --> 07:36.206
Maybe losing my job is like...
Is like part of some plan.

07:38.625 --> 07:38.709
Wait. This is coming from
the guy who doesn't even want

07:41.128 --> 07:41.211
to acknowledge that shit
actually happens for a reason.

07:42.754 --> 07:42.838
You're talking about fate,
I don't believe in that.

07:43.964 --> 07:44.047
And yet, you're a fatalist.

07:45.424 --> 07:45.507
Not even close.

07:47.718 --> 07:47.759
I'm sorry. Sorry, it was easy.

07:49.386 --> 07:49.553
-Easy.
-You really think so?

07:50.721 --> 07:52.723
Yes, indeed.

07:53.974 --> 07:54.057
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:55.309 --> 07:55.392
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:59.229 --> 07:59.855
Someone is calling you.

08:01.398 --> 08:01.481
-Again?
-Get out of here.

08:02.566 --> 08:02.733
Go get yourself fired.

08:03.817 --> 08:08.238
Shit.

08:12.492 --> 08:12.743
Are you firing me, Naseem?

08:14.745 --> 08:14.828
You have a past, eh, Stretch?

08:18.624 --> 08:18.832
Lots of drugs, alcohol, gambling.
You were addicted, yes?

08:20.626 --> 08:20.709
I was addicted, yes. Severely.

08:25.464 --> 08:25.547
Uh, but I haven't placed a bet, uh,
taken a drink or done a drug in over a year.

08:27.341 --> 08:27.716
Oh, right.

08:29.593 --> 08:29.760
Do you believe you owe something?

08:32.136 --> 08:32.221
Uh, to the people I gambled against?

08:35.432 --> 08:35.515
Uh, yes. About $6,000 to be exact.

08:37.100 --> 08:37.267
$6,000?

08:39.019 --> 08:39.436
Well, it was 12, so I cut it in half.

08:41.772 --> 08:41.855
Do you believe that you owe me something?

08:43.607 --> 08:43.649
Well, you have given me a ton of breaks, so...

08:45.817 --> 08:46.360
'Cause I need the old you now.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.114
The part of you powered by pure need, hmm?

08:54.034 --> 08:54.117
These other companies like this cockfuckers

08:56.828 --> 08:58.288
Cossack trying to steal our clients.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.043
So I need every driver to work
as hard as they've ever worked,

09:07.965 --> 09:08.006
for if these Cossack sons of whores
take over, I'm out of business.

09:09.383 --> 09:09.466
And you are out of luck.

09:11.677 --> 09:11.760
This is do,

09:13.345 --> 09:14.638
or this is die.

09:16.056 --> 09:16.557
Yes, indeed.

09:18.350 --> 09:18.433
Yes, indeed.

09:19.518 --> 09:19.685
It's funny.

09:20.811 --> 09:20.853
I would've bet anything

09:23.981 --> 09:25.023
that Naseem was gonna cap my ass
this morning and send me packing.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.485
Huh, I guess things are looking up already.

09:32.489 --> 09:32.573
Hey.

09:33.574 --> 09:33.991
Oh, shit.

09:34.992 --> 09:35.659
Whoo!

09:38.245 --> 09:38.328
-Look at this motherfucker.
-Iggy.

09:40.330 --> 09:40.414
I know you've been getting my calls.
You're fuckin' ignoring 'em.

09:41.999 --> 09:42.082
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:43.208 --> 09:43.292
Before you say anything else,

09:45.752 --> 09:45.836
you need to know that
I'm totally powerless against this.

09:48.005 --> 09:48.088
-Okay, this is not good.
-This is not good at all.

09:50.507 --> 09:50.841
Carlos has sold the farm. It's new ownership.

09:53.093 --> 09:53.177
No books. So, the six grand you owe...

09:54.845 --> 09:59.433
I'm gonna need it by midnight tonight.

10:01.185 --> 10:01.226
-Fuck me!
-Exactly.

10:03.353 --> 10:03.604
-You're serious?
-I'm colon cancer.

10:04.855 --> 10:04.938
I pay every month on time!

10:06.899 --> 10:06.982
-I know.
-Well, do they know?

10:08.150 --> 10:08.567
They do and they don't give a shit!

10:10.402 --> 10:10.485
I got a better shot at

10:13.447 --> 10:13.530
shitting out a full grown female giraffe

10:16.825 --> 10:16.867
than coming up with six grand
by midnight tonight!

10:19.536 --> 10:20.954
-Can I talk to the new owners?
-Can you speak Cantonese?

10:23.707 --> 10:24.124
-All right, so if I can't get the cash?
-What do you think, Kevin?

10:25.876 --> 10:25.959
I've been chasing you all around town.

10:27.544 --> 10:27.628
When you call me Kevin
I really start to flip out.

10:29.171 --> 10:29.213
Yeah, you should get freaked out,

10:31.715 --> 10:31.924
because I'm gonna have
to leave a lot more than bruises behind.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.260
Don't make me come looking for you.

10:38.430 --> 10:38.514
Uh, babe, I'm sorry
but I'm running really fucking late.

10:40.140 --> 10:40.224
Tell me
you're messing with me, dude.

10:42.726 --> 10:42.768
Uh, I got hung up with an old friend.

10:45.646 --> 10:45.729
What is wrong with you?
This is a first run of the day.

10:46.855 --> 10:46.897
- Charlie...
- First one!

10:50.234 --> 10:58.200
Charlie, relax. I'll handle it.
Now, who am I pickin' up?

11:10.295 --> 11:11.296
Has anyone ever referred to you
as a punk-ass motherfucker?

11:13.757 --> 11:14.675
Uh, not to my recollection.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.137
You're a punk-ass motherfucker.

11:20.806 --> 11:21.515
Who's an hour late.

11:23.016 --> 11:23.100
Um, I'm really sorry.

11:24.601 --> 11:24.685
Come on, son.

11:27.980 --> 11:28.063
If you're gonna patronize me,
at least put your fucking back into it.

11:29.857 --> 11:29.940
You don't have any respect for the Hoff.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.277
Am I right?

11:35.571 --> 11:36.238
You think I never held a knife?

11:39.116 --> 11:40.117
That I'm unfamiliar with the taste of blood?

11:43.745 --> 11:43.954
That I took a shitty, sub-par show
about lifeguards,

11:47.624 --> 11:47.666
and turned it into the highest-rated
syndicated hit in television history

11:50.002 --> 11:51.336
because I got fuckin' lucky?

11:57.676 --> 11:58.594
I once forcibly sodomized
a Viet Cong colonel with a stick grenade

12:02.848 --> 12:03.432
because he placed an ancestral curse
on me while I was interrogating him.

12:06.810 --> 12:06.852
And I don't even believe in ancestral curses,

12:10.814 --> 12:18.655
but that's how fucking deep I roll.

12:23.202 --> 12:23.410
If Karl with a "K" represented
the light of the limo industry,

12:27.664 --> 12:27.748
then its black hole, its darkest dungeon

12:32.628 --> 12:32.669
came in the form of a nameless, ageless
Eastern European immigrant

12:35.589 --> 12:36.381
known simply as, "The Jovi."

12:38.509 --> 12:38.842
He lorded over his company Cossack

12:42.387 --> 12:42.471
with an iron fist
and a white-maned hair metal band wig

12:46.183 --> 12:47.684
that looked like Dog the Bounty Hunter
had been dropped into a deep fryer.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.145
I don't care how it sounds.

12:52.814 --> 12:52.898
That hair scared the living shit out of me.

12:58.654 --> 12:59.029
This blow-dried, death shroud that encased
The Jovi in permanent, perpetual shadow

13:00.989 --> 13:08.989
made him seem indestructible.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.031
Fuck!

13:45.951 --> 13:46.285
What the fuck, dude? Naseem's going nuts!

13:47.494 --> 13:47.661
What happened to Hasselhoff?

13:49.246 --> 13:49.329
The Jovi got him?

13:51.248 --> 13:51.290
Did you not get Naseem's speech
to the troops today?

13:52.374 --> 13:52.416
I did, I did.

13:55.210 --> 13:55.502
This is the fifth client we've lost
to The Jovi in the last month.

13:59.131 --> 13:59.464
He picked off Andy Cohen last week
and he got Seacrest yesterday.

14:00.883 --> 14:00.924
Flew him to Vegas personally.

14:02.676 --> 14:02.759
What? Jovi's a fucking pilot?

14:04.887 --> 14:04.928
Naseem thinks he's monitoring
our dispatch calls.

14:06.263 --> 14:06.305
I mean, I... I don't know.

14:08.432 --> 14:08.473
Oh, is that why those guys
were in the office today?

14:09.474 --> 14:09.558
Yep.

14:12.019 --> 14:12.102
They wired us up
so we can eavesdrop on The Jovi.

14:14.438 --> 14:14.479
So we're stealing his clients too?

14:15.606 --> 14:15.856
Tit for tat.

14:17.983 --> 14:18.400
I want in. Jovi jacked Hasselhoff,

14:20.652 --> 14:21.111
and I want to steal
The Jovi's next client, whoever it is.

14:23.363 --> 14:23.447
And not to mention, babe,
but I need the cash, badly.

14:26.074 --> 14:26.450
I'm way too good to you.

14:28.827 --> 14:29.453
I'll keep my eye out for a big fish
and let Naseem know.

14:31.413 --> 14:31.455
It might buy you a stay of execution.

14:32.497 --> 14:32.581
-I'll call you back.
-Yes, indeed.

14:34.374 --> 14:34.958
--Here you go.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.127
Here it is.

14:39.129 --> 14:39.379
That is called "take-charge shit," son!

14:41.548 --> 14:41.632
"That is called 'take-charge shit,' son!

14:43.467 --> 14:43.509
"Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed.

14:44.885 --> 14:44.968
"Hi, my name is Stretch,

14:48.597 --> 14:48.889
"aka Billy Big Balls With Bad Ideas."

14:51.475 --> 14:51.558
Karl would appear to me occasionally

14:53.602 --> 14:53.644
when I was exhausted or otherwise beat.

14:55.270 --> 14:55.312
I thought you hated this job?

14:56.355 --> 14:56.772
Doesn't mean I can afford to lose it.

14:59.483 --> 14:59.525
Wearing a mustache
that he said he grew in hell.

15:01.276 --> 15:01.443
Just drink.

15:04.488 --> 15:04.780
You're so boring. Do some blow.

15:06.657 --> 15:06.698
-Anything...
-I need you to leave me alone.

15:09.493 --> 15:09.535
I'm not here, dicksmoke! I'm a figment.

15:12.120 --> 15:12.329
I'm your fragile, fagotty mind!

15:16.375 --> 15:17.543
Fracturing from lack of sleep,
anxiety, weakness...

15:19.211 --> 15:20.337
Failure.

15:25.592 --> 15:25.676
I knew it was in my head, but lately,
he was showing up more and more.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.098
You know, right before I blew my head off,
I rolled the gun barrel in powdered sugar.

15:33.851 --> 15:34.351
It was between that and cake batter.
Which way are you leaning?

15:35.519 --> 15:35.561
I couldn't kill myself.

15:37.813 --> 15:42.484
You are killing yourself, fuckwit!

15:46.864 --> 15:47.364
All right, so that was just dumb luck.

15:50.284 --> 15:51.034
Iggy tracking me down,
making me late for Hasselhoff.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.078
I gotta stay positive.

15:55.330 --> 16:00.335
I'm pretty sure karma owes me one now.

16:01.753 --> 16:09.753
Fuck me!

16:13.056 --> 16:14.725
No, no, no.

16:19.229 --> 16:19.897
You fucker!

16:21.732 --> 16:23.859
You fucker! You fucker!

16:25.360 --> 16:25.903
Holy shit!

16:29.364 --> 16:29.489
- Yes, indeed.

16:34.077 --> 16:34.119
Yo, we got an ASAP in Cossack.
You still wanna steal Jovi's clients?

16:35.204 --> 16:35.454
Babe, I just saw a gun fight.

16:37.247 --> 16:37.456
-My ears are still ringing.
-Was it in the Valley?

16:39.374 --> 16:39.875
-Yeah.
-Shocker.

16:41.919 --> 16:41.960
-Are you all right?
-Oh yeah, I'm good. Woke me up.

16:43.462 --> 16:43.545
Limo, not so much. Took a little damage.

16:44.755 --> 16:44.838
What kind of damage?

16:46.924 --> 16:46.965
Uh, bullets of the bullet-hole variety.

16:48.592 --> 16:48.759
You're fucking with me. Really?

16:51.345 --> 16:51.428
Yeah, whatever. Who cares?
Gives it a little character.

16:54.139 --> 16:54.223
So, are we gonna boost
The Jovi's client list or what?

16:57.267 --> 16:57.309
Yup. Ray Liotta, Sony in Culver City
going to Santa Monica Airport.

17:00.604 --> 17:00.687
And Liotta's a personal client, bitches!

17:02.648 --> 17:02.731
All right, fuck The Jovi
and his horrible head of hair.

17:04.191 --> 17:04.273
- Oh, sick!

17:06.068 --> 17:06.234
-- You love it.

17:07.736 --> 17:07.986
-I owe you, babe.
-All right, I'm hanging up.

18:01.623 --> 18:01.665
We'll need you back at 7 a.m.

18:05.210 --> 18:05.335
No! No, no, no, no, no. Just push the call!

18:07.004 --> 18:07.045
I'm not gonna land and go straight to set.

18:09.047 --> 18:09.131
It's stupid. Come on, Monica.

18:11.049 --> 18:11.133
- That's not my name.
- Marcy! I knew that.

18:12.301 --> 18:12.342
I knew that.

18:13.635 --> 18:13.677
Why are you so angry all the time?

18:16.513 --> 18:18.015
-You always seem so angry. What's wrong?
-You want me to tell you?

18:20.058 --> 18:21.059
-Is it me?
-No.

18:22.728 --> 18:22.811
Oh, well then I don't give a shit.

18:24.521 --> 18:24.563
- Mr. Liotta.
- I'm just being honest.

18:26.648 --> 18:26.690
Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm your driver.
Can I take your bags?

18:28.859 --> 18:28.942
Wait, wait, wait. Where's what's-his-name?
My guy? That Jovi?

18:30.485 --> 18:30.527
Well, he couldn't make it today, sir.

18:33.864 --> 18:33.947
Uh, he's traveling with another client.
My car's right down there.

18:35.574 --> 18:35.657
What, do you work for him?

18:37.034 --> 18:37.075
I work for a rival company, sir.

18:40.162 --> 18:40.204
My company called when
he couldn't make the pick-up personally.

18:41.955 --> 18:42.372
He's driving David Hasselhoff right now.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.082
Who?

18:45.876 --> 18:47.085
From TV? Baywatch?

18:48.212 --> 18:48.295
Knight Rider?

18:51.381 --> 18:51.423
Remember back in the '80s?
That, uh... That car that talked?

18:54.259 --> 18:54.343
No, I don't remember a fucking car that talked.

18:55.511 --> 18:55.552
Car that talked.

18:57.137 --> 18:57.221
What movies has he been in?

19:00.599 --> 19:00.682
Uh, well, not one that I can think of offhand.

19:02.935 --> 19:03.018
Wait a second,
I'm getting tossed for a TV actor

19:05.270 --> 19:05.479
who hasn't been in one movie
that you can remember?

19:07.397 --> 19:07.439
Honestly, sir, it, uh...

19:10.567 --> 19:12.945
It's really shocking to me
that you're being treated this way.

19:14.363 --> 19:14.821
You're not an actor, are you?

19:17.282 --> 19:17.908
-Actually...
-'Cause that last line...

19:20.911 --> 19:20.953
About being really shocked,
I didn't buy it for a second.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.957
Not a second.

19:28.418 --> 19:28.919
That's all we need is another
wannabe Denzel driving a fucking limo.

19:30.462 --> 19:30.546
Come on, come on, come on,
it's hot, it's hot, it's hot.

19:31.922 --> 19:31.964
Watch your legs.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.092
--Dick.

19:37.344 --> 19:37.427
Fucking unbelievable!

19:39.763 --> 19:39.805
What? What? What, Marcy?

19:43.392 --> 19:43.934
You've been fucking calling me
since I left the fucking set!

19:46.019 --> 19:46.562
What could be so fucking important?

19:47.729 --> 19:49.523
What?

19:50.524 --> 19:51.191
What?

19:53.527 --> 19:54.486
Fuck me! Gosh, damn it!

19:56.238 --> 19:56.280
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna give it to the driver,

19:58.198 --> 19:58.282
he'll get it back, okay? I'm sorry.

19:59.283 --> 19:59.658
Sorry.

20:02.119 --> 20:02.286
-Everything all right?
-Will you do me a favor?

20:03.787 --> 20:03.912
-Take this back to Sony.
-Mmm.

20:06.748 --> 20:06.790
Give it to that little dyke Marcy
with the red hair, okay?

20:08.292 --> 20:08.333
Can you do that for me?

20:10.460 --> 20:11.587
Look, there's blanks in that gun
so don't be an asshole.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.505
Absolutely.

20:13.589 --> 20:15.132
- I'll have it to them within the hour.
- Thanks.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.301
Wow. That's very kind of you.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.011
Hey.

20:20.012 --> 20:23.182
And that Jovi...

20:24.600 --> 20:27.519
You made yourself a new enemy today.
Be careful.

20:27.603 --> 20:32.232
Yeah, well, The Jovi's just
going to have to take a number.

20:32.316 --> 20:35.569
Right now I'm a bit preoccupied with
the six large I need to come up with for Iggy.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.571
Liotta's $200 tip, while generous,
isn't going to save me

20:38.697 --> 20:40.365
- from a pair of shattered kneecaps.

21:03.555 --> 21:06.433
I know what you're thinking.

21:06.517 --> 21:10.312
It's stupid of me to be lavishing
attention on my love life

21:10.395 --> 21:13.774
the same day that a very agitated
member of the Mexican mafia

21:13.857 --> 21:17.236
has promised to break things
I don't want broken.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.570
And there's always the chance that
this "Pinkminx" isn't actually a woman,

21:23.951 --> 21:25.911
there was just something about the...

21:26.453 --> 21:31.291
Pink. Huh.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.628
Well, if that's stupid,
then this is just plain old reckless.

21:35.587 --> 21:36.713
The one addiction
I haven't been able to shake.

21:36.964 --> 21:39.007
Her.

21:39.091 --> 21:42.928
Let's not call it stalking.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.390
I know I'm not getting her back,
there was just never any closure.

21:47.766 --> 21:50.102
On some cellular level that still torments me.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.437
Could you be a bigger chump right now?

21:53.772 --> 21:54.940
Not really, no.

21:58.986 --> 22:01.321
"She left me, the loser limo driver,

22:01.655 --> 22:03.907
"for a millionaire athlete.

22:04.950 --> 22:08.495
"And I never saw it coming."

22:10.831 --> 22:12.791
Seriously, pal, did that shocker
really sneak up on you?

22:16.128 --> 22:17.254
Yeah, it did.

22:19.464 --> 22:20.632
Yes, indeed.

22:21.133 --> 22:24.052
I got you a booking.

22:24.136 --> 22:25.971
-The great white whale has surfaced...
-Oh.

22:26.388 --> 22:27.639
...and his name is Roger Karos.

22:27.723 --> 22:29.516
Heard of him?

22:30.058 --> 22:31.185
-If he's cash rich, I don't care.
-Huge.

22:31.476 --> 22:35.230
Billionaire.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.065
He used to be Karl's regular
and he sorta still thinks Karl's alive.

22:37.149 --> 22:39.484
Uh, come on. I can be Karl.

22:39.568 --> 22:45.157
From what I heard, this dude's pretty nuts,

22:45.199 --> 22:47.492
but I've also heard of him tipping
thousands just for an airport run, so...

22:47.576 --> 22:48.994
-All right, where?
-I've got coordinates.

22:49.453 --> 22:51.288
You... You got what?

22:51.330 --> 22:54.291
Coordinates. GPS.

22:54.333 --> 22:56.710
He doesn't want to disclose the location,
I don't know what that means.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.921
Oh, and he wants to be met
with a weird list of goodies.

22:59.004 --> 23:00.380
You have to get that
before you go and pick him up.

23:00.923 --> 23:02.049
I'll text it to you.

23:02.132 --> 23:05.469
Oh, God damn it!

23:05.511 --> 23:07.930
I forgot, I gotta take
this stuff over to Sony for Liotta.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.473
You do that and this booking goes poof.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.350
-Come on.
-All right, all right, all right.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.271
I'll figure something out.

23:16.730 --> 23:19.316
Charlie comes through in the clutch,

23:19.691 --> 23:22.528
a crazy billionaire who can paint my pockets.

23:23.529 --> 23:25.739
The only thing missing now
is the crazy billionaire.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.575
These are the coordinates, X marks the spot.

23:29.201 --> 23:31.078
I'm here. Where is this guy?

23:33.914 --> 23:35.374
--Shit!

23:43.257 --> 23:44.299
What the fuck?

24:03.777 --> 24:04.987
Oh, shit!

24:11.076 --> 24:12.327
Uh...

24:21.461 --> 24:22.588
Mr. Karos?

24:55.954 --> 24:58.624
Oh, you're not Karl.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.835
-I'm Kevin.
-Who the fuck is Kevin?

25:02.294 --> 25:03.670
That's me, uh, Stretch, if you'd prefer.

25:03.754 --> 25:05.923
What I prefer is Karl.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.717
Okay. Um, Karl...

25:09.176 --> 25:10.928
Uh, passed away

25:14.306 --> 25:15.807
a little while ago.

25:17.017 --> 25:18.644
So I'm here.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.905
-Those are the things I asked for?
-Yeah.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.366
-Scotch?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:33.242 --> 25:36.578
-Caulking gun?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.294
- Butt plugs, plural?
- Mmm-hmm.

25:45.337 --> 25:48.006
What'd he die of? Karl?

25:50.843 --> 25:52.886
He took his own life, unfortunately.

26:00.185 --> 26:03.438
Fuck him.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.692
I need a driver and a confidant,
a bagman and a protector.

26:08.694 --> 26:11.780
-I'm in.
-Walk with me.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.616
You got any religious hang-ups?
You a godhead?

26:15.325 --> 26:19.955
Uh, nope.

26:20.205 --> 26:23.458
Uh, tomorrow I will be a brand new face
in a brand new place,

26:24.751 --> 26:26.170
so I've got a marathon in mind.

26:26.837 --> 26:28.380
First stop,

26:28.463 --> 26:31.091
my tailor Enzo.

26:31.884 --> 26:33.635
That suit looks like death taking a shit.

26:33.719 --> 26:35.721
How far is Beverly Hills?

26:45.814 --> 26:48.400
Uh, 45 minutes, depending on which...

26:48.942 --> 26:51.195
Okay,
so this Karos is a total freak show.

26:51.904 --> 26:55.324
So what? It's Hollywood.

26:58.285 --> 27:00.495
A town that specializes
in the sick and deranged.

27:00.996 --> 27:03.916
As long as he's got the cash,

27:04.166 --> 27:07.753
I can take all the weird... Holy shit!

27:08.795 --> 27:12.090
Boris. The Jovi's brother and head henchman.

27:12.216 --> 27:15.052
I once saw him body slam
a 300-pound bouncer

27:16.887 --> 27:18.597
onto the hood of a VW Cabriolet.

27:19.181 --> 27:20.641
He had plates in his head.

27:20.724 --> 27:23.602
Hello, buddy.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.187
He had murdered men with his hands.

27:26.063 --> 27:27.981
He knows about Liotta.

27:28.106 --> 27:29.858
He knows what I did.

27:36.365 --> 27:38.450
- Fuck it.

27:41.537 --> 27:43.872
Yes, indeed.

27:44.081 --> 27:45.791
What's wrong? You sound weird, is it him?

27:45.874 --> 27:47.960
He skydived in, naked.

27:48.043 --> 27:50.629
No way, completely naked?

27:50.671 --> 27:52.965
Mmm-hmm, bare-assed,
except for a pair of sneakers

27:53.006 --> 27:54.341
and about 60 pounds of Rick Rubin's beard.

27:54.466 --> 27:56.927
If you're feelin' funky about it,

27:57.302 --> 28:01.181
we'll just lay him off on The Jovi.
It's not worth it.

28:01.306 --> 28:03.600
No, I can't explain it.
I mean, as oddball as he is,

28:03.642 --> 28:04.977
I get the sense that, like,
my meeting him is a...

28:05.060 --> 28:07.855
If you say fated...

28:07.938 --> 28:11.275
Let me finish. Not fated, lucky.

28:11.358 --> 28:13.277
-Luck, fate, I mean, it's semantics.
-Do me a favor.

28:13.318 --> 28:15.821
Go online, get me a bio, all right?

28:15.863 --> 28:18.407
I got a feeling this guy's about
to skip town for good

28:19.157 --> 28:21.493
and bleed a boatload of cash on his way out.

28:21.577 --> 28:24.079
-It's a big gamble.
-From a former gambler.

28:24.246 --> 28:26.331
I know odds. He's sitting on my $6,000.

28:26.623 --> 28:28.750
-Long shot.
-Sure thing.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.043
I'm going on the Internet now.

28:32.171 --> 28:36.216
All right. Call me back.

28:36.842 --> 28:38.135
No, I've got a vehicle,
I'll ring you with the time and a place later.

28:38.468 --> 28:39.511
Later.

29:15.547 --> 29:20.260
What kind of man are you, Stretch?

29:20.344 --> 29:22.429
Are you one of those Habitat-for-Humanity,
eco-friendly, all-veggie douchebags

29:22.513 --> 29:23.805
devoted to crippled kids and the elderly?

29:28.060 --> 29:29.853
Or are you a money, power, pussy,

29:30.812 --> 29:32.147
Holy Trinity type?

29:32.231 --> 29:37.361
I don't know. Haven't really...

29:38.278 --> 29:41.323
You see, me, I am about
simple, succinct pleasures.

29:41.532 --> 29:45.953
Cocaine is my first
and longest-standing love,

29:46.828 --> 29:47.955
but I would be equally lost
without good Scotch whiskey...

29:52.000 --> 29:53.961
...and sadomasochism.

29:54.378 --> 29:56.129
I want you to try something
when you have a free moment.

29:57.297 --> 30:00.008
You just make a fist,

30:00.092 --> 30:03.929
and hit yourself in the face
as hard as you can.

30:04.096 --> 30:05.639
I swear to God,
you will find it so fucking freeing.

30:06.682 --> 30:08.976
It is like...

30:15.440 --> 30:17.109
It is like stepping off a cliff.

30:17.150 --> 30:18.944
--Holy shit!

30:18.986 --> 30:21.822
-There it is.
-You okay back there?

30:22.114 --> 30:23.949
That metallic taste, it's tremendous!

30:25.951 --> 30:27.369
It's living!

30:27.452 --> 30:29.288
Hey, can I ask you, what do you...

30:29.329 --> 30:30.789
What do you get out
of punching yourself in the face?

30:40.799 --> 30:44.678
Clarity.

30:47.264 --> 30:49.766
The comfort in knowing
I can take that punch.

30:50.767 --> 30:53.270
What do you make weekly, this line of work?

30:54.313 --> 30:56.982
Don't know, depends. 25-30 an hour.

30:58.108 --> 30:59.484
-Plus tips.
-Take home, total?

31:01.653 --> 31:03.655
Not enough.

31:04.198 --> 31:07.284
-To get by.
-No.

31:07.326 --> 31:09.453
- Or to pay down $6,000 in gambling debt...

31:14.666 --> 31:16.418
...that you just found out was due in full.

31:17.169 --> 31:19.755
You're a gambler?

31:20.172 --> 31:22.049
I have a, uh... I had...

31:22.424 --> 31:26.678
A gambling addiction.

31:27.971 --> 31:30.057
That just means
you lost a lot more than you won.

31:30.349 --> 31:32.601
And if you don't pay, what happens then?

31:32.684 --> 31:35.187
Broken bones? Bullet in the head?

31:42.444 --> 31:45.447
That, uh, that could be a coin toss.

31:47.115 --> 31:48.200
Are you a fire starter, Stretch?

31:48.951 --> 31:54.206
Am I what?

31:55.999 --> 31:57.668
Oh, it takes almost no imagination,
sounds exactly like what it is.

31:59.294 --> 32:00.796
Are you a fire starter?

32:01.129 --> 32:02.464
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I guess.

32:02.548 --> 32:06.552
No, say it in stride.

32:07.261 --> 32:10.222
"I am a fire starter."

32:11.265 --> 32:12.558
I am a fire starter.

32:14.518 --> 32:16.019
Good.

32:32.035 --> 32:33.996
So am I.

32:34.079 --> 32:35.122
Now, we're on fire!

32:35.247 --> 32:36.456
Holy shit!

32:44.381 --> 32:45.799
Jesus Christ.

32:50.637 --> 32:52.556
Goddamn! What is wrong with you?

32:54.516 --> 32:55.976
God damn it.

33:03.692 --> 33:05.611
Fine.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.161
- Did you say firefighter?

33:21.001 --> 33:26.381
Do my bidding tonight, Stretch, and maybe...

33:27.966 --> 33:29.635
Maybe I'd dig down deep
and make that $6,000 worth of headache...

33:41.021 --> 33:42.606
...disappear.

33:44.024 --> 33:45.692
You game?

33:46.985 --> 33:49.238
Yes, indeed.

33:59.581 --> 34:00.916
Thank you.

34:01.792 --> 34:04.127
So, where we headed tonight?

34:04.378 --> 34:06.255
Have you heard of the Midnight Shadow?

34:06.338 --> 34:07.464
- Social club.
- I have heard.

34:07.923 --> 34:09.675
What have you heard?

34:12.302 --> 34:13.804
Gentlemen, I have everything I need.

34:13.846 --> 34:15.514
Uh, give me 10 minutes.

34:15.597 --> 34:17.099
- Eight minutes, Enzo.
- You want my coat?

34:17.181 --> 34:20.226
No, no, no. Ciao, ciao.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.688
-No, no. No, no. No, no.
-Ciao, ciao. Ciao, ciao. Choo-choo train.

34:22.896 --> 34:26.483
Um, in a nutshell, um...

34:26.525 --> 34:29.862
You can pay to see a coked-out
snow leopard sexually assaulted in one room

34:29.945 --> 34:33.031
and, uh, participate
in an all-amputee-orgy in the next?

34:33.699 --> 34:35.242
Oh, drugs, sexual depravity, animal cruelty.

34:35.367 --> 34:38.036
I mean to me that's just a slow night, but...

34:38.203 --> 34:40.956
- That's very good!

34:42.416 --> 34:43.500
That's very quick, Stretch. I like that.

34:47.504 --> 34:50.507
I like so very few people.

34:53.844 --> 34:56.804
I'm wondering how
you endeared yourself to me so fast.

34:58.223 --> 35:00.517
I think fate brought us together.

35:02.311 --> 35:04.313
I don't believe in fate, destiny...

35:05.647 --> 35:07.274
To me life's nothing but timing.

35:07.733 --> 35:09.401
I like that!

35:09.484 --> 35:10.611
Life is nothing but timing.

35:12.279 --> 35:14.489
Yeah.

35:14.990 --> 35:16.283
I'm going to steal that one.

35:16.366 --> 35:18.368
Okay.

35:26.251 --> 35:27.794
- Uh...

35:27.920 --> 35:29.713
You okay?

35:31.423 --> 35:33.467
Mr. Karos?

35:33.967 --> 35:35.219
I think I just fell asleep.

35:35.260 --> 35:37.221
I think so, too.

35:37.262 --> 35:39.473
That's very soft, by the way.

35:39.556 --> 35:40.766
-You bought it.
-Is that alpaca?

35:47.105 --> 35:48.607
I don't think so.

35:48.899 --> 35:51.693
You look sharp.

35:55.948 --> 35:57.282
Sit tight. Have some company joining us.

36:02.579 --> 36:04.206
Finally.

36:04.289 --> 36:06.667
-Yo.
-Hey, talk to me.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.794
I have someone named Marcy from Sony

36:09.795 --> 36:12.089
on the line who's in complete hysterics.

36:12.130 --> 36:14.132
Oh, shit, yes.
That's the stuff I was telling you about.

36:14.258 --> 36:18.470
The prop gun that Liotta wanted me to return.

36:18.637 --> 36:21.473
She said that she and the prop master
can't leave set because you, my friend,

36:21.849 --> 36:23.725
have a registered firearm
that could be used to commit a crime.

36:23.809 --> 36:26.353
Well, tell her forget it. It's not gonna happen.

36:26.436 --> 36:29.606
I got a client. Speaking of which,
did you find out anything?

36:29.857 --> 36:33.485
First of all, I just want to say
I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart

36:33.527 --> 36:34.695
he's about to be indicted
on major money laundering.

36:34.778 --> 36:36.864
-What?
-Yeah.

36:36.947 --> 36:39.533
I mean, these investment pyramid schemes,

36:39.616 --> 36:41.368
some shady Nigerian holding company
he was involved with...

36:41.451 --> 36:42.995
Wait, where are you seeing this stuff?

36:43.078 --> 36:44.329
On the LA Times website.

36:44.413 --> 36:45.747
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

36:45.831 --> 36:47.833
Kick him the fuck out!

36:47.875 --> 36:49.334
Kick him out... I can't kick him out.

36:52.421 --> 36:54.381
Here they are.

36:54.464 --> 36:56.300
I'm shameless in that I pay for pussy,

36:57.301 --> 36:58.552
but this is

36:59.344 --> 37:04.850
world class.

37:06.226 --> 37:07.561
This is a level of appreciation
one reserves for great art, or fine wine or...

37:16.612 --> 37:18.071
Ah, whatever.

37:22.826 --> 37:24.119
Oh...

37:25.370 --> 37:27.706
The one in the middle there,

37:27.789 --> 37:31.251
the things she can do
with her mouth and throat,

37:33.212 --> 37:34.922
will have you thinking one of her ancestors
fucked a python at some point.

37:35.005 --> 37:36.048
--Yep.

37:54.358 --> 37:55.734
Wow.

38:19.591 --> 38:21.802
Benedict Canyon, 10,000 block, entry fee.

39:02.134 --> 39:04.845
Jesus!

39:04.928 --> 39:06.471
You know there's a reason
they call Karos "Captain Fisty."

39:06.513 --> 39:08.098
All right. You, uh...

39:16.815 --> 39:21.486
Ew.

39:21.612 --> 39:24.531
The Midnight Shadows Social Club
didn't have a single fixed address.

39:24.615 --> 39:28.285
It was a horrible, hedonistic little road show,

39:29.119 --> 39:33.040
that would pop up at a new
and unsuspecting location each time.

39:33.665 --> 39:35.167
Rumor had it they once desecrated
the Right Field Pavilion at Dodger Stadium,

39:35.250 --> 39:36.418
but because it was the first inning...

39:38.462 --> 39:40.047
...nobody was there to witness it.

39:42.841 --> 39:44.927
Midnight Shadow.

39:48.472 --> 39:50.599
-Uh, Mr. Karos...
-No name.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.686
Entry fee.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.618
There you go.

40:09.701 --> 40:10.827
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

40:15.999 --> 40:18.001
It's all here.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.049
I'm leaving now. Bye-bye.

40:25.884 --> 40:27.553
This ought to be interesting.

40:34.393 --> 40:36.687
- There we go.

40:36.895 --> 40:38.605
I'm not sure, but...

40:38.689 --> 40:39.773
I think someone just got pregnant in there.

40:42.067 --> 40:43.735
Ovulating.

40:43.819 --> 40:45.445
-Uh-oh.
-Whatever.

40:49.199 --> 40:50.701
Tell your mom I said hi.

40:51.535 --> 40:53.537
Mr. Karos?

40:58.041 --> 41:00.794
He had a disco ball... Mr. Karos?

41:03.922 --> 41:05.507
-I didn't see you get out of the car.
-Nor did I.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.595
Are you completely flipped out?

41:09.928 --> 41:11.096
I drove Charlie Sheen for six weeks.

41:11.430 --> 41:13.056
Who's he?

41:13.348 --> 41:15.767
-Doesn't matter.
-Doesn't matter.

41:16.143 --> 41:18.562
We're out of blow and these bitches
are aardvarks.

41:18.854 --> 41:20.772
- Okay.
- Bring back as much as you can carry.

41:20.939 --> 41:23.942
-Okay.
-All right.

41:24.026 --> 41:25.986
The Xavier Club, Hollywood,
you ask for Laurant.

41:26.069 --> 41:28.405
He's a Frenchman. He has a briefcase.

41:28.447 --> 41:31.909
You bring it back to me, no matter what.

41:32.117 --> 41:34.786
Under no circumstances
do you fail in this endeavor,

41:35.162 --> 41:36.288
or our entire night is null and void,
understood?

41:38.457 --> 41:40.792
Understood.

41:40.876 --> 41:43.587
This is on a countdown.

41:44.463 --> 41:46.673
It's set up for 99 minutes
which is exactly how long I'll be inside.

41:48.717 --> 41:51.303
You come back before it runs out.
Not a minute more.

41:51.887 --> 41:53.722
There's a lot of money in this, Stretch.

41:54.556 --> 41:55.807
Maybe $6,000.

41:58.519 --> 42:00.562
Tell me to have fun.

42:02.981 --> 42:05.025
- Enjoy yourself over there.

42:05.567 --> 42:07.152
There's no joy in there.

42:25.754 --> 42:27.965
--Uh-oh.

42:28.048 --> 42:30.300
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, cockfucker.

42:30.342 --> 42:31.677
-Uh, Naseem...
-Bring the limo back.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.011
-You're fired.
-What?

42:33.053 --> 42:34.680
Fired? I got us Liotta.

42:34.721 --> 42:37.599
Liotta says he wants to kill you!

42:37.683 --> 42:39.643
You don't return a registered weapon
after he paid you to?

42:39.768 --> 42:41.812
What the fuck?

42:41.854 --> 42:44.523
Bring the limo back or I swear to God,

42:44.565 --> 42:46.191
the cops are sitting right in front of me,
I'm gonna tell him you stole it.

42:46.275 --> 42:47.901
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, Naseem, listen,

42:48.026 --> 42:52.781
I am with a client, Mr. Karos.

42:53.115 --> 42:55.701
No! I told you, this is do, or this is die,

42:55.742 --> 42:57.911
and you're fucking dead!

42:57.995 --> 42:59.371
You're dead! Dead! Dead...

42:59.830 --> 43:01.206
- I gotta go.

43:02.082 --> 43:04.334
Hello?

43:04.376 --> 43:05.836
Motherfucker hung up on me.

43:13.218 --> 43:14.720
Charlie!

43:15.554 --> 43:17.681
Right there.

43:17.723 --> 43:19.391
Hey, can I park here for a few minutes?

43:20.184 --> 43:22.561
Fuck, no. Are you kidding?

43:22.895 --> 43:24.104
Can I park it here for a few minutes?

43:24.188 --> 43:26.064
Stay as long as you want.

43:26.148 --> 43:27.399
Just long enough
to pick up a briefcase.

43:30.736 --> 43:32.738
- Because I'm all in now.

43:35.407 --> 43:37.034
Huh.

43:41.371 --> 43:42.414
Get the briefcase.

43:43.415 --> 43:46.627
Get it.

43:46.710 --> 43:50.255
Miami,

43:50.339 --> 43:52.466
but didn't get it because
the casting director felt I didn't,

43:52.549 --> 43:53.842
as she put it, "Own the space."

43:54.551 --> 43:58.263
Excuse me. Thank you.

43:58.931 --> 44:00.724
I'm, uh, looking for a man named Laurant.

44:01.975 --> 44:03.435
Not seeing that name.

44:03.769 --> 44:05.270
Oh, there he is.

44:05.354 --> 44:07.481
-Elevator inside.
-Thank you.

44:09.358 --> 44:12.653
-He's up in VIP.
-Hold that.

44:14.112 --> 44:16.740
I don't think I understood
what they meant until this very moment.

44:16.782 --> 44:20.702
- Because the truth of the matter is...

44:20.786 --> 44:22.871
...I ain't getting a sniff of that briefcase
without heeding those words.

44:26.083 --> 44:27.543
--Yeah, it's not Karos...

44:27.626 --> 44:30.170
You can do this.

44:31.255 --> 44:32.631
- Own the space. Own the space.

44:32.714 --> 44:34.675
- Own the space.
- Billy Big Balls,

44:34.925 --> 44:37.135
becomes Geisha Bitch Boy.

44:37.678 --> 44:40.639
Running errands for a mad man.

44:41.265 --> 44:45.561
-Shut up.
-You're not getting that money.

44:45.644 --> 44:50.566
And then Ignacio is gonna break
every part of you that can be broken.

44:50.649 --> 44:53.318
Who, but an absolute asshole
would bank on a $6,000 tip?

45:00.993 --> 45:02.744
--Fuck you.

45:03.287 --> 45:05.372
- "Laurent"?
- Laurant.

45:06.123 --> 45:07.499
-La... What?
-La...

45:08.917 --> 45:11.044
...rant.

45:11.837 --> 45:13.463
-Mr. Karos sent me.
-Mmm-hmm.

45:13.964 --> 45:15.924
You have something for me?

45:16.008 --> 45:17.384
I have something for Monsieur Karos.

45:17.759 --> 45:19.052
Well, I'm here in his place.

45:20.137 --> 45:25.142
Mmm.

45:25.809 --> 45:28.353
To pick up a briefcase
and return to him in 78 minutes.

45:28.437 --> 45:30.439
-Is he timing you?
-He is.

45:30.939 --> 45:32.399
And why would he be timing you?

45:32.858 --> 45:34.818
Well, you'd have to ask him.

45:36.236 --> 45:38.697
Would I have to ask him
about my ledgers as well?

45:38.780 --> 45:40.282
This was supposed to be an exchange.

45:41.533 --> 45:43.869
Wasn't that explained to you?

45:44.328 --> 45:46.288
Ledger for briefcase.

45:47.080 --> 45:49.041
Ledger for briefcase.

45:49.124 --> 45:50.459
-Ledger...
-Oh, so let me get this straight.

45:52.544 --> 45:54.046
It was ledgers for briefcase?

45:55.714 --> 45:57.841
Where is Monsieur Karos now?

45:58.550 --> 46:00.177
I really couldn't tell you.

46:01.220 --> 46:02.804
I'm certain you could.

46:03.722 --> 46:07.726
Look around you.

46:08.977 --> 46:11.271
Mon vieil ami, he has put you into
very bad spot with very bad people.

46:11.396 --> 46:13.065
Own the space.

46:14.274 --> 46:15.901
Yeah, all right, listen.

46:16.652 --> 46:18.529
"Laurent."

46:19.029 --> 46:22.908
--Easy.

46:23.617 --> 46:24.701
You want an LAPD Tactical Team
on your ass in the next 10 seconds?

46:25.244 --> 46:27.454
Huh?

46:28.080 --> 46:29.498
Then keep fucking with me!

46:30.582 --> 46:33.418
You see it?

46:33.544 --> 46:36.922
I'll get you your ledgers,
you have my word.

46:37.005 --> 46:39.842
But right now, you're gonna give me
that goddamn briefcase,

46:39.925 --> 46:41.385
or I'm gonna turn this VIP room
into a goddamn pig roast

46:42.261 --> 46:44.304
with more cops than you can count.

46:44.388 --> 46:46.807
When the smoke clears,

46:46.890 --> 46:49.476
and you're in LA County,
hip-deep in hardened cons

46:49.560 --> 46:51.770
who wanna double park
their dicks in your hind hole,

46:52.104 --> 46:56.817
you're gonna be wishing
you had this moment back.

46:57.150 --> 46:59.778
Wishing that you had taken the word
of a heavily decorated,

47:00.279 --> 47:03.448
veteran police officer,

47:04.032 --> 47:05.742
instead of trying to play tough guy
in your tennis whites.

47:06.493 --> 47:08.579
So come on, Crayola,

47:15.669 --> 47:17.421
you wanna color or what?

47:30.309 --> 47:32.269
75 minutes.

47:33.687 --> 47:35.439
I'll get you your ledgers.

47:36.190 --> 47:38.275
You have my word,

47:44.198 --> 47:46.200
and I'm a man of my word.

47:47.326 --> 47:49.828
I see a lot of eyeballs.

47:50.454 --> 47:53.290
You better put them on a fucking dimmer

47:58.504 --> 48:01.131
before I put cases on all of you bitches!

48:04.301 --> 48:05.511
Make a lane. Make a lane.

48:21.860 --> 48:25.405
Who the fuck was that guy?

48:25.614 --> 48:26.949
Yay!
I can't believe I just did that.

48:29.201 --> 48:30.869
Where the fuck is Karos?

48:30.994 --> 48:32.120
That was awesome!

48:32.204 --> 48:34.164
-Right?
-Yeah.

48:34.206 --> 48:35.290
Tonight, get this guy or he's gone.

48:35.374 --> 48:36.875
I'm not gonna lie to you,

48:37.209 --> 48:39.127
- I'm pretty impressed.

48:39.545 --> 48:41.296
Non-extradition country ghost!

48:41.922 --> 48:43.423
Don't get cocky.

48:43.507 --> 48:46.260
The agreement was ledgers in the hand,

48:46.343 --> 48:48.887
him in person.
This is 10 months of undercover work,

48:48.971 --> 48:50.305
six months of Rosetta Stone
learning fucking French.

48:50.597 --> 48:52.558
I hate the fucking French!

48:52.641 --> 48:54.142
-Fuck!
-Hey, relax. We'll get him.

48:54.226 --> 48:56.562
Get a hold of the justice lawyers downstairs,

48:56.603 --> 48:57.688
tell them to sit tight,
do not let them book flights home.

48:57.729 --> 49:00.399
Order them room service.

49:00.440 --> 49:03.694
Call the LAPD,
run deep background on this asshole.

49:03.735 --> 49:05.070
'Cause I need to find out everything
known and unknown about this shithead!

49:14.913 --> 49:16.206
Oh, shit.

49:16.915 --> 49:18.125
Candice.

49:19.585 --> 49:20.627
Fuck.

49:21.962 --> 49:23.755
Fuck!

49:24.965 --> 49:27.259
Whatever you do, don't follow her.

49:27.384 --> 49:30.929
Ah, you're following her.

49:31.597 --> 49:33.432
The chances of seeing her tonight
have gotta be fucking astronomical.

49:34.391 --> 49:35.767
Right, you need to turn around and leave.

49:35.851 --> 49:39.271
You're not leaving, you idiot.

49:39.354 --> 49:42.858
Do you not recall those wicked little
left hooks to the heart she threw,

49:43.025 --> 49:46.069
that knocked your ass flat
for an entire fucking year?

49:46.153 --> 49:47.738
All you are doing
is chasing more punishment.

49:55.621 --> 49:56.622
Seriously, what are you doing?

49:56.705 --> 49:57.831
Club soda.

49:57.915 --> 49:59.958
All right. Great, okay.

50:03.462 --> 50:06.465
Well, you're here, what's the play, hotshot?

50:08.008 --> 50:09.468
You guys, I'm just gonna be right back.
I'm gonna get more.

50:09.551 --> 50:11.887
Right. Here she comes.

50:11.970 --> 50:13.931
-Say something cool.
-Oh, my God.

50:14.056 --> 50:15.307
-Kevin.
-What?

50:15.682 --> 50:17.476
-Hey!
-Hi.

50:17.726 --> 50:19.144
-How are you?
-Good.

50:19.228 --> 50:21.522
-Yeah.
-You?

50:21.605 --> 50:23.982
Yeah, um, it's... Yeah, good, it's my...

50:24.441 --> 50:26.235
-It's...
-Ah, bachelorette party I'm gonna guess.

50:27.569 --> 50:30.072
-Yeah.
-Good. Um...

50:30.197 --> 50:31.782
Great suit. You look... You look good.

50:31.823 --> 50:33.825
You look better.

50:33.867 --> 50:35.077
Congratulations, too.

50:35.160 --> 50:38.455
-Really?
-Yeah.

50:38.497 --> 50:39.540
-You mean it?
-Of course, of course. I'm so happy for you.

50:39.623 --> 50:40.874
-Happy?
-Yeah.

50:42.459 --> 50:44.294
-Really?
-You bet.

50:44.336 --> 50:46.463
Are you... Are you meeting someone or...

50:46.672 --> 50:48.674
I'm actually here on business, unfortunately.

50:48.757 --> 50:49.758
A client, right? Someone you're driving?

50:49.842 --> 50:53.512
No, no, no.

50:54.179 --> 50:55.472
I'm not really, uh, driving anymore, Candice.

50:56.682 --> 50:57.766
I'm being driven.

50:58.517 --> 51:01.770
Hmm.

51:02.688 --> 51:03.897
Uh, could I get a vodka juice, please?
Thank you.

51:10.195 --> 51:11.864
What do you mean?

51:13.657 --> 51:15.659
Are you carrying a gun?

51:16.034 --> 51:17.452
I seriously can't talk about it.

51:23.292 --> 51:25.419
It's better that I go.

51:25.502 --> 51:27.963
Subject arrived in a stretch limo.

51:28.046 --> 51:31.216
There's bullet holes in the side panel.
They look recent.

51:31.258 --> 51:33.719
And a check on the license plate
says the limo reported as stolen.

51:33.802 --> 51:36.054
Tag that limo!
This asshole will lead us straight to Karos,

51:36.096 --> 51:38.182
but you're gonna put
rotating parallels on him.

51:38.223 --> 51:39.600
No straight tails because if he's a cop,

51:39.683 --> 51:41.351
he's gonna sniff 'em out.

51:41.393 --> 51:42.728
- Copy that.

51:48.775 --> 51:51.486
-So?
-Yeah?

51:52.321 --> 51:53.906
-What's in there?
-Oh, can't say.

51:55.073 --> 51:59.244
-Is it money?
-Hmm.

51:59.286 --> 52:00.621
You're not mixed up
in anything illegal, are you?

52:03.498 --> 52:04.666
Candice.

52:06.335 --> 52:07.794
Thank you.

52:08.629 --> 52:11.423
--Thank you.

52:12.216 --> 52:17.137
You have no idea what
your leaving did for me.

52:17.763 --> 52:19.723
And by breaking up with me
you gave me the greatest gift ever.

52:21.016 --> 52:22.267
The life that I always wanted,

52:24.394 --> 52:26.438
I now have.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.067
--There we go.

52:30.108 --> 52:31.276
You just seem so together.

52:31.318 --> 52:33.654
You know, I don't know.

52:33.737 --> 52:35.531
You look... You look better
than I've ever seen you.

52:35.614 --> 52:37.824
-Ready for your car, sir?
-Yeah.

52:37.908 --> 52:40.244
So, listen, um, we're gonna go out

52:40.285 --> 52:43.622
if maybe you wanna see one another later.

52:43.664 --> 52:46.250
Candice, you need to enjoy
your last night of freedom.

52:49.753 --> 52:53.090
I need you to go upstairs now, okay?
All right?

52:53.298 --> 52:54.716
Suspect is in front of the club
conversing with an unknown female.

52:55.217 --> 52:57.970
You're gonna make a beautiful bride

52:59.471 --> 53:00.597
and a wonderful, wonderful wife.

53:00.639 --> 53:02.766
Bye.

53:02.808 --> 53:04.101
Twenty bucks if you drive me out of here.

53:04.309 --> 53:05.644
Make it 40 and I'll do it.

53:05.769 --> 53:06.979
Fucker.

53:09.481 --> 53:10.816
Just get the door for me, please?

53:13.485 --> 53:15.195
-There you go.
-Oh.

53:23.829 --> 53:25.831
Oh, blowing a kiss, huh?

53:36.258 --> 53:37.593
Bro, who the fuck was that?

53:38.135 --> 53:40.512
An ex or something?

53:40.721 --> 53:42.181
No, dude. That was the ex.

53:43.599 --> 53:43.849
What? Did she dump your ass?

53:46.935 --> 53:46.977
She destroyed me.

53:48.395 --> 53:48.437
-Well, payback's a bitch. Am I right?
-Yes, it is. You are right.

53:50.856 --> 53:50.939
How long have you been planning that stunt?

53:52.608 --> 53:54.193
I didn't. It just... It just happened.

53:55.569 --> 53:55.777
She look like that
when you went out with her?

53:58.363 --> 53:58.447
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

54:00.616 --> 54:00.657
-That bitch is fucking fine.
-Thank you.

54:01.950 --> 54:02.034
-She have those tits when you dated her?
-Uh, yeah.

54:04.912 --> 54:04.953
Those things look natural, were they?

54:06.705 --> 54:06.788
Okay, see, the principle of a payback
is that you get to enjoy it.

54:09.625 --> 54:09.708
And I'm not being able to do that right now.

54:11.627 --> 54:11.710
-You know what I'd like to enjoy? Those tits.
-I gotcha. I gotcha.

54:13.170 --> 54:13.253
Ever do that thing
where you put your dick between them?

54:15.464 --> 54:15.547
Uh-oh.

54:17.883 --> 54:17.966
What'd you just do?

54:20.844 --> 54:20.928
Fuck. Your limo just lost power, man.

54:22.054 --> 54:22.137
-Did you just do that?
-Oh, now this NavStar light's blinking.

54:23.138 --> 54:24.723
-What?
-That's probably bad news.

54:26.141 --> 54:26.808
Oh, fuck!

54:30.437 --> 54:30.479
-Stretch?
-What? Hey...

54:31.939 --> 54:32.272
Did they just use the NavStar system
to disable the limo?

54:33.982 --> 54:34.066
Yes, they did.

54:35.275 --> 54:35.317
-God damn it.
-I'm outta here, bro.

54:36.860 --> 54:36.944
-Good luck!
-Where you going?

54:38.487 --> 54:38.570
Hold on, Charlie. I'll call you back! Wait!

54:39.821 --> 54:39.863
-Stretch!
-Hey, man, where you going?

54:42.866 --> 54:43.492
Bro, this car is dead.

54:45.452 --> 54:45.661
-Can you help me push, please?
-No, it's not going anywhere. Oh, hey! Look!

54:47.204 --> 54:47.287
Shit! Come on! Come on!

54:49.456 --> 54:49.498
Get back on the wheel
and please help me push.

54:51.291 --> 54:51.458
-Take the tow truck!
-I can't take the tow truck, all right?

54:53.168 --> 54:53.252
I got a client! Shut the fuck up!

54:54.378 --> 54:54.461
Hey! Hey! Be nice to me!

54:55.546 --> 54:55.629
-Hey! I'm being nice to you!
-I'm helping you!

54:57.840 --> 54:57.923
-You're doing a great job!
-I'm helping you!

55:00.175 --> 55:00.217
Thank you!
Thank you for that positive feedback.

55:02.261 --> 55:02.344
-I could do with less sarcasm.
-You're doing wonderful. Fantastic.

55:03.345 --> 55:03.387
-We should go out sometime.
-Really? Do you mean that?

55:04.388 --> 55:04.471
-No!
-Because a bunch of my buddies

55:05.681 --> 55:05.764
just got married

55:07.432 --> 55:09.184
and I don't have a lot of people
to hang out with.

55:11.770 --> 55:12.396
That's shocking to me.
Just push the fucking car.

55:14.231 --> 55:14.314
- Oh, shit. It's fucking power steering.
- Just push and shut up!

55:15.357 --> 55:15.440
Come on, come on. Here we go.

55:20.153 --> 55:20.195
You just got it on the curb and in a red-zone.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

55:21.572 --> 55:21.655
-Come on! Just push it a little further.
-What?

55:23.323 --> 55:23.365
Just get it a little further.
We're in the red-zone.

55:24.783 --> 55:26.368
There is no further.
You're up on the curb now.

55:29.746 --> 55:29.830
Come on, man! I'm a...

55:31.707 --> 55:33.125
-Just help me push it a little further.
-You're definitely gonna get towed right here.

55:34.835 --> 55:34.877
Fine, fine, fine, fine. Here.

55:37.087 --> 55:38.088
-Pleasure doing business with you, man.
-Yeah.

55:40.799 --> 55:40.883
Eat your own dick! Suck it!

55:42.593 --> 55:42.676
If I lose this limo now,
it's game over.

55:43.719 --> 55:43.927
I'm done. My fate is sealed.

55:46.430 --> 55:47.514
Oh, God.

55:48.724 --> 55:48.891
Come on, start! Start. Come on, start!

55:50.684 --> 55:50.726
Holy shit. The Jovi.

55:52.352 --> 55:52.561
I don't know about you, hoss,

55:54.813 --> 55:55.564
but I don't like where this is headed.

55:56.565 --> 55:59.526
--No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56:04.114 --> 56:04.198
The vehicle you are
occupying has been reported stolen.

56:05.908 --> 56:06.491
The engine functions have been disabled.

56:10.412 --> 56:11.038
Come on! Damn it!

56:14.249 --> 56:14.750
Whether that fate is
a wrath-of-God-like beating from Boris there,

56:16.460 --> 56:18.045
or just wasting away in a life
I never intended to live,

56:19.505 --> 56:19.588
it's got me cornered now.

56:22.174 --> 56:22.841
God, he's really big.

56:25.636 --> 56:26.678
Maybe all this was inevitable.

56:29.389 --> 56:30.933
Facing this now. Figuring it out on the fly.

56:32.643 --> 56:32.893
Life doesn't allow you to rehearse.
You just have to...

56:34.978 --> 56:35.521
...live and learn.

56:36.939 --> 56:37.898
God damn it. That has to mean something.

56:39.983 --> 56:40.817
What do I want it to mean?

56:42.319 --> 56:44.279
And what the hell do I do with it?

56:52.621 --> 56:59.670
That's what I'm talking about!

57:01.046 --> 57:01.129
You know, that really works.

57:03.465 --> 57:03.799
This is the NavStar operator.

57:06.301 --> 57:06.343
Ma'am, this is Detective Raymond Liotta
of the LAPD.

57:08.262 --> 57:10.389
I am occupying the stolen vehicle
and I am pinned down

57:12.724 --> 57:13.642
in a gun battle with
the armed suspects who stole...

57:15.143 --> 57:15.227
Ma'am! You have got to start this car for me!

57:16.436 --> 57:16.478
Oh, God, Bill! Are you dead?

57:18.146 --> 57:18.230
-Oh, man, I think he's dead.
-Oh, my God.

57:20.023 --> 57:20.107
Bill! Bill! Are you hit? You're hit!

57:21.149 --> 57:21.233
Oh, my God! Ma'am, he's hit!

57:24.278 --> 57:24.319
Officer, what is going on?

57:27.531 --> 57:27.739
Oh, my partner's been gun shot.
There's so much blood everywhere!

57:30.576 --> 57:30.659
-Oh, my God.
-They keep firing at us, ma'am!

57:32.661 --> 57:33.161
They keep firing! Start this car for me, please!

57:36.164 --> 57:36.331
Come on, Billy! Come on, Billy!

57:38.000 --> 57:38.208
Oh, God! I'm outta ammo.
Bill, we're gonna die.

57:39.585 --> 57:39.668
I'm so sorry! I tried!

57:41.003 --> 57:41.545
I did everything I could!

58:02.024 --> 58:02.357
We're good! We're good. We gotta go
to the hospital now. Thank you so much!

58:03.984 --> 58:04.067
Get it! Get it! Get it! Motherfucker!
That's what I'm talking about! Fuck CSI!

58:06.195 --> 58:06.278
Well, you just might get

58:09.239 --> 58:09.323
- your SAG card after all, princess.

58:10.532 --> 58:10.616
Hey, suspect was involved
in a shots-fired incident

58:11.700 --> 58:11.783
up in Hollywood Boulevard.

58:15.037 --> 58:18.957
-When?
-Just now!

58:21.835 --> 58:26.632
Unless he's killing people in the street,
we don't touch him until he has Karos in tow.

58:27.633 --> 58:27.716
- Holy shit.

58:30.636 --> 58:31.386
-How's the hunt?
-Iggy, I'm so close.

58:35.098 --> 58:35.182
How close?

58:38.477 --> 58:38.560
I'm staring at hundreds of thousands
of dollars as we speak.

58:39.853 --> 58:39.895
Andale. Well, shave six Gs off that shit.
I'll meet you in 30.

58:44.399 --> 58:44.525
Yeah, wish it were that easy.

58:47.194 --> 58:47.236
Mira, Stretch. If $6,000 isn't delivered
to me by 12:01 AM

58:49.071 --> 58:52.824
you're gonna see some shit
up close you'll never forget.

58:54.201 --> 58:54.243
Because you won't be able to.

58:55.827 --> 58:58.413
Oh, fuck.

59:02.584 --> 59:02.626
Stop.

59:05.045 --> 59:05.087
Ay, what up, player?

59:08.340 --> 59:08.423
Trying to get this fine set of dimes up Sunset.

59:10.342 --> 59:11.426
-My boys gots a table and the goose is loose.
-Ah!

59:13.303 --> 59:13.387
-Grab a cab, yeezy. I'm busy.
-Hey, dude!

59:14.721 --> 59:14.763
-You don't recognize me?
-No.

59:15.848 --> 59:15.931
I'm ACB, man!

59:18.976 --> 59:19.977
I was on Idol!

59:21.979 --> 59:23.605
Nigga, Cee Lo Green be all up in my shit
trying to get me signed to his label, dog.

59:25.440 --> 59:25.649
These girlies are my backup singers.
Come here, girls!

59:28.110 --> 59:28.151
Wanna hear something?
Little bit of sample do?

59:29.319 --> 59:29.403
-No.
-All right, dude, this is from my new album,

59:31.822 --> 59:31.905
Bitches and Tits.

59:33.115 --> 59:33.198
This is the single It's Raining Tits.
You ready?

59:36.451 --> 59:36.535
Oh, my God.

59:39.538 --> 59:39.788
We be getting all romantic, watching Titantic

59:43.792 --> 59:43.876
-You roll up on me quick
-Let me suck your dick

59:46.295 --> 59:48.130
You can suck my dick

59:49.131 --> 59:49.298
Baby

59:51.300 --> 59:51.383
Wow.

59:53.594 --> 59:53.635
-That's really terrible.
-Come on, dude!

59:56.680 --> 59:56.763
I just sang for my supper, homie.

59:58.682 --> 59:58.765
It's like a 10-minute ride, dude.
Let me Jigga-Jay-Z this motherfucker.

01:00:00.976 --> 01:00:01.018
-Fifty bucks per block.
-Damn, nigga!

01:00:04.354 --> 01:00:04.938
Why you gotta do me
like this in a public place?

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:11.945
Because you're a giant bag. That's why.
Look at you.

01:00:14.573 --> 01:00:14.656
Has your father stopped crying?

01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:16.033
Three-hundy. Best I can do.

01:00:18.744 --> 01:00:18.827
And the coke.

01:00:22.039 --> 01:00:25.501
-What coke?
-Those three chicken heads wouldn't get

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:28.462
within spitting distance of you unless
you got some yay. Now, gimme.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:30.464
-I like you.
-I don't like you.

01:00:33.467 --> 01:00:33.884
-You got Facebook, dude?
-Fuck off.

01:00:36.803 --> 01:00:36.845
All right. Let's ride, ladies.

01:00:39.014 --> 01:00:39.097
Suspect is engaged with
an unidentified white male,

01:00:42.142 --> 01:00:46.647
who's accompanied by three females.

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:50.234
Stay put! That sounds like Karos.
We're en route right now.

01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:52.903
- Come on, girls! It's shower time, baby!

01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:54.363
Pop bottles on the J-Lo!

01:00:55.864 --> 01:00:56.073
Hey, chill out back there.

01:00:58.492 --> 01:01:00.369
Them vocals is golden, dude.

01:01:02.287 --> 01:01:02.955
It's gonna be a platinum record
for real, homie.

01:01:04.706 --> 01:01:05.207
--Is that spray paint?

01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:06.625
-Stretch?
-Put the spray paint away.

01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:08.794
Put the spray paint away.

01:01:09.795 --> 01:01:10.754
Ah, fuck!

01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:13.924
Stretch!

01:01:16.426 --> 01:01:16.510
-All right.
-You are going to jail.

01:01:18.554 --> 01:01:18.595
The police put out a warrant for your arrest.

01:01:20.639 --> 01:01:20.722
Wait. Where... Where's the limo?

01:01:22.599 --> 01:01:23.392
-Driving down Sunset with me.
-It's running?

01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:26.728
-How?
-My friends at NavStar.

01:01:29.231 --> 01:01:29.356
Stretch!

01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:31.733
Stretch!

01:01:33.527 --> 01:01:33.610
You are a wanted felon.

01:01:37.364 --> 01:01:37.531
Are you fucking delusional?

01:01:39.575 --> 01:01:39.616
Listen, I'm gonna finish this night with Karos,
collect my fee and then hit restart.

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.952
Love, life, career, all of it.

01:01:44.162 --> 01:01:44.246
All this weirdness that
I got sucked into tonight,

01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:46.206
it rebuilt my mojo!

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:48.333
Do you not get what's going on here?

01:01:50.711 --> 01:01:50.752
Come on.
Not only do I get it, I'm getting the better of it.

01:01:52.254 --> 01:01:52.337
I am beating a game that
kicks my ass on a regular basis.

01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:54.798
Remember how you said I was a fatalist

01:01:57.843 --> 01:01:57.926
that couldn't function unless everything
around me was turning to shit?

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:00.053
Well, guess what? That is happening,
and I am thriving. Do you understand that?

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:02.931
It's like the worse it gets, the better I am.

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:06.435
It's like I'm five steps ahead.

01:02:09.229 --> 01:02:17.229
You can suck my dick, baby!

01:02:23.118 --> 01:02:23.160
--Fuck!

01:02:24.369 --> 01:02:24.453
Sunset and Cahuenga, right now!

01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:27.706
Karos just stole the limo.

01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:29.124
The driver's outside removing
the license plates, and he just took off!

01:02:32.044 --> 01:02:32.252
Oh, shit.

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:35.130
Hey, man. Excuse me.

01:02:36.298 --> 01:02:37.341
You see some punk Kanye West
wannabe white boy

01:02:38.717 --> 01:02:39.927
come through here with a shitty mohawk?

01:02:41.345 --> 01:02:41.845
All right. Um...

01:02:44.473 --> 01:02:45.390
I'm gonna need your car.

01:02:47.476 --> 01:02:47.684
Oh, you mean, like,
the police commandeer your car?

01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:51.772
-Yeah.
-No.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:52.981
Unless you're really Officer...

01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:54.149
Ray Liotta.

01:02:58.028 --> 01:02:58.111
You thought the badge was
a slam dunk, didn't you?

01:02:59.404 --> 01:02:59.488
I did... I did though. I really did.
Why wouldn't I?

01:03:01.406 --> 01:03:01.490
Hey, the delivery was good, man.

01:03:03.825 --> 01:03:03.867
-Man, I appreciate it. Thank you.
-It was solid. I was impressed.

01:03:05.911 --> 01:03:05.994
-Thank you. Got something going for me.
-Hey!

01:03:08.247 --> 01:03:08.372
So, how many times
you're gonna tell this story, huh?

01:03:10.749 --> 01:03:10.832
Shithead limo driver impersonating a cop.

01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:12.501
It's classic, man.
I'm gonna get a lot of mileage out of this.

01:03:14.086 --> 01:03:14.169
-Yeah, I don't blame you.
-I mean, you'd do the same.

01:03:15.671 --> 01:03:15.712
Oh, in a second. Are you kidding me?

01:03:17.172 --> 01:03:17.256
And if that's the case,
we might as well give the story

01:03:19.508 --> 01:03:20.968
-the ending it deserves, right?
-Hey, why not?

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.052
Now, give me your fucking car
before I put a bullet in your liver!

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.179
Gun!

01:03:25.514 --> 01:03:25.639
-Oh, shit!
-Yeah!

01:03:27.558 --> 01:03:28.183
Get that motherfucker!

01:03:29.518 --> 01:03:30.227
Oh, shit!

01:03:31.603 --> 01:03:31.687
You better run, white boy!

01:03:34.523 --> 01:03:42.523
So what's the plan, Stretch!

01:03:44.992 --> 01:03:45.075
Successfully outrunning
black men over flat surfaces?

01:03:46.076 --> 01:03:46.952
Oh, God!

01:03:48.161 --> 01:03:56.161
Where'd he go?

01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.380
Okay, crank it.

01:04:00.215 --> 01:04:00.299
-Oh.
-Are you all right?

01:04:01.675 --> 01:04:06.221
-No.
-Time's up, white boy!

01:04:09.141 --> 01:04:09.224
Sweet Jesus! Coloreds!

01:04:11.894 --> 01:04:19.894
- He got hit by a car!
- That's what you get!

01:04:24.573 --> 01:04:26.241
-God damn it! Stop running!
-Bring that motherfucker back over here!

01:04:32.664 --> 01:04:32.748
That is fascinating.
I mean, the way that you told that story.

01:04:33.874 --> 01:04:34.499
That's not...

01:04:36.835 --> 01:04:36.919
They got the limo.

01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:39.463
Karos wasn't inside.
Some dumb ass kid boosted it.

01:04:41.924 --> 01:04:42.007
He's got a bunch of fucking
coked up club girls in the back.

01:04:45.093 --> 01:04:45.177
- Did they recover the case?
- They have not located it yet.

01:04:47.387 --> 01:04:47.721
You get that limo towed to the nearest
impound yard and stripped to the chassis,

01:04:48.847 --> 01:04:51.391
and find that fucking driver!

01:05:03.946 --> 01:05:05.781
Oh, doll, I would love to
text you back right now,

01:05:07.866 --> 01:05:08.158
but I got bigger problems. Fuck me!

01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:09.576
You gotta get the limo back. Think.

01:05:10.953 --> 01:05:10.994
Think, God damn it.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:13.622
Hey, Bubba,
get the CHP on the line

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.918
and tell them to close
the Eastbound lane to the 101 and the 134.

01:05:20.003 --> 01:05:20.087
I want sawhorses and spike strips.

01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:22.130
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:30.472
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

01:05:32.182 --> 01:05:36.478
Slow is smooth, smooth is faster. Shit!

01:05:37.479 --> 01:05:45.479
Shit!

01:05:47.573 --> 01:05:48.907
Fuck you!

01:06:07.176 --> 01:06:15.176
Oh, shi...

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:16.852
You're gonna die out here, dickhead.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:33.869
Oh, my. Fuck me!

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:37.497
You gotta be shitting me.

01:06:38.498 --> 01:06:40.501
Of course.

01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:41.960
Fuck.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:44.922
When did they have time to do this?

01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:48.258
You can suck my dick, baby!

01:06:50.135 --> 01:06:50.219
-Jesus.
-I love what they've done with the place.

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:52.054
I can't take it back to Karos looking like this.

01:06:56.183 --> 01:07:04.183
Bro, not to point out the obvious,

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.209
you're still attached to a tow-truck
on the fucking freeway.

01:07:24.294 --> 01:07:25.754
Oh...

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.591
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:07:30.926 --> 01:07:32.344
Shit!

01:07:33.345 --> 01:07:34.304
Hey, buddy, you like that?

01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:46.308
Here we go again!

01:08:08.755 --> 01:08:16.755
Damn it!

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:25.147
- Come on, start, God damn it!

01:08:26.148 --> 01:08:26.481
Come on, come on, come on, come on. Start!

01:08:27.566 --> 01:08:27.983
Come on!

01:08:30.986 --> 01:08:31.653
Come on, I am begging you!

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:34.156
Shit!

01:08:35.823 --> 01:08:35.866
--Fuck me! Come on!

01:08:36.867 --> 01:08:36.950
-Turn on!
-Hello, baby.

01:08:39.036 --> 01:08:39.453
I am begging you right now.

01:08:40.578 --> 01:08:40.746
We have rape party, huh?

01:08:46.335 --> 01:08:47.336
We're not gonna have a rape party.

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:49.796
Little baby pussy.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:54.593
There you go!

01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:00.515
- Bye-bye!

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:12.486
Uh-oh.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:15.197
Buddy!

01:09:17.282 --> 01:09:18.617
Okay.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.622
The limo was retaken.

01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:28.627
It was what?

01:09:31.964 --> 01:09:32.923
Fuck!

01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:35.008
The tow truck driver tried to stop him.
The fucking cop got away!

01:09:36.385 --> 01:09:37.261
This cop is obviously on
a schedule with Karos.

01:09:38.804 --> 01:09:38.845
We got to get to him fast

01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.473
or Karos is gone.

01:09:43.267 --> 01:09:43.392
I want everybody pulled out right now.

01:09:44.977 --> 01:09:46.854
LAPD, Sheriff's Department, CHP.

01:09:50.314 --> 01:09:55.404
You make 'em task force loan-outs.

01:09:56.905 --> 01:10:01.410
Get a chopper up there, too.

01:10:03.161 --> 01:10:03.203
Next time Karos shows his face,
we take the whole fucking thing down.

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.792
Hey, it's Stretch.
You know what to do.

01:10:17.426 --> 01:10:17.509
Come on, Karos. Where are you, man?

01:10:20.512 --> 01:10:22.514
Let's go.

01:10:23.849 --> 01:10:25.225
Delinquents,
take your mark.

01:10:57.591 --> 01:10:57.674
What the fuck?

01:11:26.828 --> 01:11:34.828
--Oh, shit!

01:11:41.009 --> 01:11:41.093
-You're late.
-I'm not late.

01:11:42.261 --> 01:11:42.302
Did this limo get squat-fucked by Satan?

01:11:44.054 --> 01:11:44.763
Hmm.

01:11:47.266 --> 01:11:47.933
Along with your wardrobe?

01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:50.227
What in the patron saint of shit happened?

01:11:52.479 --> 01:11:52.563
Couple of twists and turns.
Few complications.

01:11:53.939 --> 01:11:54.022
Did you get the briefcase?

01:11:57.109 --> 01:11:57.150
-Laurent mentioned some ledgers.
-Did you get the briefcase?

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:02.781
- I got the briefcase.

01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:10.163
Yes, I gave my word that
I would return with those ledgers.

01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:12.791
Where's the fucking briefcase?

01:12:14.126 --> 01:12:14.209
Under your seat.

01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:18.839
Oh, you're a Magic Mike.

01:12:27.639 --> 01:12:27.723
I'm here.

01:12:30.642 --> 01:12:31.476
No, no, no, no. Public. I said public,
I want public. That's not public.

01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:35.939
You do it out in the open, then it's you
and I to the air strip and no one else.

01:12:37.524 --> 01:12:44.364
There's a place called Kite on Ivar.
Meet me there in 20.

01:12:46.575 --> 01:12:46.658
My balls are itchy.
Did you get my blow?

01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:54.499
Oh, sweet mama.

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:56.502
-No, I'm good.
-I wasn't gonna give it to you anyway.

01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:02.758
What's the problem?

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.512
You get a thumb in the ass that I missed?

01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:10.974
-Pretty rough night, Rog.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:13:15.187 --> 01:13:15.229
I'm not sure even the clothes or the car

01:13:17.397 --> 01:13:17.481
paint an accurate enough portrait

01:13:20.734 --> 01:13:20.984
of the fucking hell
that I have gone through for you.

01:13:24.613 --> 01:13:24.947
Oh, wait a minute.
You mean you did something

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:28.033
other than drive a limo while dying slowly?

01:13:30.911 --> 01:13:35.999
You went out and risked something,
you learned something. You felt something!

01:13:37.042 --> 01:13:37.376
Is that what I did? For shame!

01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:39.878
You owe me an explanation, Roger,
at the very fucking least.

01:13:43.966 --> 01:13:44.049
All right.

01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:48.679
The ledgers contain hard financials,

01:13:50.138 --> 01:13:50.222
i.e., illegal activity of everyone
I've ever done business with.

01:13:53.058 --> 01:13:53.350
And I've done business with
some bad guys that I am now selling out

01:13:55.894 --> 01:13:55.936
to save myself.

01:13:59.106 --> 01:13:59.356
-Laurent bought the ledgers?
-No, he's a blackmailer.

01:14:02.651 --> 01:14:02.734
He paid 300k. You could get 10 times that.

01:14:05.237 --> 01:14:05.279
-So, then, why don't you hang onto them?
-I'm short selling them

01:14:08.907 --> 01:14:09.074
to purchase a very expensive plane ticket
out of here tonight,

01:14:12.244 --> 01:14:12.911
one which gets me somewhere
I cannot be extradited.

01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:15.539
And the gentleman
I'm buying the flight from has a fleet of jets.

01:14:19.376 --> 01:14:19.418
He's willing to run the risk,
provided he gets the ledgers.

01:14:22.588 --> 01:14:22.921
-What about Laurent?
-He's a fucking idiot.

01:14:24.089 --> 01:14:24.339
And since I just got done explaining to you
that I did business with some bad guys

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.094
-and then beat them, that would make me...
-Worse.

01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:32.139
Better!

01:14:35.976 --> 01:14:43.976
Opposite of a fucking idiot food chain, pal.
So, fuck Laurent!

01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:56.530
And your word, none of
which means bupkis to me.

01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:08.467
--What does is "finish line."

01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:15.265
I'm gonna change.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:17.226
Muscles.

01:15:23.482 --> 01:15:26.860
Yeah?

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:37.571
You missed the fucking deadline, Kevin.
Where's my money?

01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:00.602
Where's my money?

01:16:01.854 --> 01:16:09.854
Kite, on Ivar. Twenty minutes.

01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:14.199
Stay close.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.034
Okay.

01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:18.245
Oh, no.

01:16:21.373 --> 01:16:22.666
Hello, buddy!

01:16:30.215 --> 01:16:31.216
Now, you are my victim, huh?

01:16:32.259 --> 01:16:33.093
Stretch, it looks like
our journey has come to an end.

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:38.223
-You've been a wonderful driver.
-What?

01:16:41.393 --> 01:16:42.102
Where are you going?

01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:46.315
And now, I'm going to fuck you up, dick!

01:16:47.316 --> 01:16:49.735
--Chill, drago. Let him go.

01:16:50.903 --> 01:16:51.486
He owes me six grand,
so, before you fuck him up, I need to collect.

01:16:52.738 --> 01:16:52.779
Trucha.

01:16:53.989 --> 01:16:54.573
Mr. Karos!

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:56.909
Wait. Will you just...

01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:59.995
I need to, uh, settle a bill.

01:17:01.163 --> 01:17:02.998
Would you mind letting me go there?

01:17:09.129 --> 01:17:10.839
Have a rape party with them.

01:17:12.841 --> 01:17:20.841
All that's left is the, the tip.

01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:34.730
The gratuity.

01:17:37.157 --> 01:17:37.282
Let me know...

01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:46.875
You were late getting back to me.

01:17:48.877 --> 01:17:50.796
No.

01:17:53.382 --> 01:17:55.467
And to quote you,
"Life is nothing but timing."

01:17:58.804 --> 01:17:59.638
Told you I was gonna steal that one.

01:18:04.059 --> 01:18:05.978
Like I've stolen everything else before.

01:18:09.815 --> 01:18:10.983
But that's not the reason you're
getting fucked, I was just having fun.

01:18:14.653 --> 01:18:14.862
Truth is, you were always gonna get fucked,
pal, because you are a beta male!

01:18:18.532 --> 01:18:21.159
And I grind guys like you
down to make my bread.

01:18:22.661 --> 01:18:23.787
Promise of six grand
was all it took to fit you for strings.

01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:29.668
Now, who but an absolute asshole
would bank on a $6,000 tip?

01:18:31.336 --> 01:18:32.629
Sound familiar?

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:36.133
I said that first.

01:18:40.512 --> 01:18:40.971
Take comfort in this.

01:18:43.056 --> 01:18:43.682
You got beat by the best.

01:18:47.186 --> 01:18:47.227
By a bona fide, true, blue-blooded

01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:50.814
bad guy.

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:53.692
I eat, sleep, fuck, earn,

01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:03.744
ergo, I survive.

01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:08.707
And when this whole marble
has finally melted down

01:19:11.376 --> 01:19:12.711
and the roaches are running what remains,
I will be crowned their king!

01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.464
Because I am a fire starter, Stretch.

01:19:16.215 --> 01:19:18.550
And you are

01:19:18.592 --> 01:19:19.801
not!

01:19:30.729 --> 01:19:31.730
Cops.

01:19:32.564 --> 01:19:33.565
Drop the fucking gun!

01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:36.318
Feds.

01:19:36.401 --> 01:19:38.070
That's Karos.

01:19:38.153 --> 01:19:39.404
Fuck.

01:19:39.488 --> 01:19:40.906
You're a fucking fed?

01:19:40.989 --> 01:19:42.533
That's right, I'm a fucking fed, asshole!

01:19:42.574 --> 01:19:43.575
Drop the briefcase, turn around,

01:19:43.659 --> 01:19:46.578
put your hands on your head.
How about that?

01:19:46.662 --> 01:19:51.416
Stretch, you're going to jail.

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:53.418
Do it!

01:19:55.045 --> 01:19:56.088
After all this?
After this fucking night?

01:19:56.588 --> 01:19:57.589
You lost, you let
a lying-piece-of-shit crook play you.

01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:00.342
And now, you're going down with him.

01:20:04.263 --> 01:20:04.346
Gun.

01:20:05.347 --> 01:20:06.682
Gun!

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.644
Holy shit! You have to do something.

01:20:12.521 --> 01:20:13.480
Your whole life has led to this night,
this very moment.

01:20:14.606 --> 01:20:17.442
Do something.

01:20:19.695 --> 01:20:20.028
You have got to do something.

01:20:21.864 --> 01:20:26.410
Own the space.

01:20:28.203 --> 01:20:28.620
Own it!

01:20:30.455 --> 01:20:35.586
He couldn't have been more wrong about me.

01:20:36.587 --> 01:20:37.462
I am a fire starter.

01:20:38.839 --> 01:20:46.839
And now we're on fire.

01:21:01.236 --> 01:21:09.236
Iggy!

01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:15.709
Here's your six grand!

01:21:28.096 --> 01:21:36.096
You're under arrest!
Get up! Get the fuck up!

01:21:44.154 --> 01:21:52.154
You got balls, Stretch! Big balls!

01:22:27.948 --> 01:22:32.286
Argh!

01:22:34.997 --> 01:22:40.169
Yeah! That's more like it.

01:22:49.428 --> 01:22:54.349
Hi, uh, coffee, please. Black.

01:22:55.350 --> 01:23:02.524
Sorry, babe.

01:23:10.657 --> 01:23:14.912
I knew you weren't French.

01:23:14.995 --> 01:23:16.788
I'm about as French as you are LAPD.

01:23:17.915 --> 01:23:21.043
Speaking of...

01:23:21.126 --> 01:23:23.712
Told you I'd get those ledgers for you.

01:23:23.795 --> 01:23:27.090
Yeah, but what you didn't tell me is you were
gonna throw away my $300,000 to do it.

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:29.718
I thought Karos was gonna shoot.

01:23:30.552 --> 01:23:31.637
Somebody would've returned fire, then
somebody else might've gotten killed.

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:34.389
I didn't know Karos was a, was an FBI target.

01:23:34.473 --> 01:23:36.558
I thought he was just some rich flake
that I could make a big tip off of.

01:23:43.565 --> 01:23:45.234
I don't know how it sort of snowballed on me.

01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:49.905
Just one thing led to another and...

01:23:51.156 --> 01:23:54.660
Look at me.

01:23:54.826 --> 01:23:58.330
It doesn't take much

01:23:59.623 --> 01:24:01.083
to go from good to bad.

01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:03.919
Smallest, dumbest little twist of fate
sometimes.

01:24:04.503 --> 01:24:06.255
I didn't believe in that, "fate,"
before last night.

01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:09.842
My friend, everything happens for a reason.

01:24:09.925 --> 01:24:11.426
Has to be that way.

01:24:11.677 --> 01:24:13.262
It'd be too depressing otherwise.

01:24:13.303 --> 01:24:15.931
So, am I going to jail then?

01:24:16.014 --> 01:24:17.349
If you are, I'm not taking you. You taking him?

01:24:17.432 --> 01:24:19.601
-Nah.
-Nah.

01:24:19.685 --> 01:24:23.564
Karos is locked up, hopefully, for life.

01:24:25.107 --> 01:24:26.108
I'm gonna go home
and see if my wife still recognizes me.

01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:27.484
You're out of a job.

01:24:28.402 --> 01:24:29.486
You have warrants outstanding,
and you're probably gonna be the target

01:24:33.323 --> 01:24:34.741
of multiple lawsuits. So, I'd say
you're swimming in your fair share of shit.

01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:36.451
Pretty much.

01:24:36.702 --> 01:24:39.246
You're on your own now, pal.

01:24:39.288 --> 01:24:42.082
Good luck.

01:24:42.124 --> 01:24:43.625
You should do it professionally.

01:24:43.667 --> 01:24:44.668
What?

01:24:44.793 --> 01:24:49.715
Acting. You should do it professionally
'cause you're good, man.

01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:59.391
I mean, you're really good.
I totally believed everything you were doing.

01:25:00.058 --> 01:25:01.268
-Really?
-Yeah!

01:25:07.441 --> 01:25:09.735
Thank you.

01:25:14.656 --> 01:25:15.908
If I'm you, next time I'm sitting in a limo,
I'm in the backseat.

01:25:34.343 --> 01:25:35.636
Thank you.

01:28:01.698 --> 01:28:02.908
If you like stories about chance
and coincidence and fate,

01:29:35.918 --> 01:29:37.628
then here's one you've never heard.

01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:39.588
Boy meets girl...

01:29:40.005 --> 01:29:41.548
Girl is the one
he's been looking for his entire life.

01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:42.591
Yes, indeed.

01:29:42.925 --> 01:29:44.343
Go. And set.

01:29:44.426 --> 01:29:45.427
Two cameras, A mark.

01:29:46.845 --> 01:29:48.597
-And action.
-Action.

01:29:49.306 --> 01:29:51.892
Action!

01:29:54.394 --> 01:29:56.063
Those are the things I asked for?

01:29:56.104 --> 01:29:57.105
Yeah.

01:29:59.107 --> 01:30:00.192
-Scotch?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:30:02.945 --> 01:30:06.114
-Caulking gun?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:30:06.657 --> 01:30:10.619
-Cheese puff?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:30:10.661 --> 01:30:13.205
One?

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:19.837
- Wilford Brimley's office, please?

01:30:20.128 --> 01:30:21.421
She just looks so ridiculously happy,
doesn't she?

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:23.048
Not to rub salt in the wound,
but I hear the groom-to-be has

01:30:24.633 --> 01:30:26.802
a gorilla-sized cock

01:30:26.885 --> 01:30:28.470
and a tongue like an octopus.

01:30:34.142 --> 01:30:35.602
B mark, action!

01:30:39.147 --> 01:30:42.442
--J. Edgar Hoover. Do you know who he is?

01:30:42.484 --> 01:30:44.611
- I do.

01:30:44.945 --> 01:30:45.946
He's Leonardo Di Caprio.

01:30:46.363 --> 01:30:48.657
-Not the same person.
-Yep.

01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:51.285
- No, he played him in a movie.
- Arnie Hanger.

01:30:51.618 --> 01:30:54.079
Oh, I thought you'd get that.

01:30:56.415 --> 01:30:57.541
B mark.

01:30:57.624 --> 01:30:59.918
-Scotch? Tracksuit?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:31:01.128 --> 01:31:01.170
Caulking gun? Cheese Fritos?

01:31:02.963 --> 01:31:03.005
-Cold vanilla milk?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:31:04.715 --> 01:31:04.798
Raven's blood.

01:31:09.469 --> 01:31:09.553
Could you be...

01:31:12.431 --> 01:31:12.514
- Fuck!

01:31:14.641 --> 01:31:15.225
It's on fire, it's on fire.

01:31:20.522 --> 01:31:21.648
I thought you were gonna
shit the bed for sure.

01:31:23.942 --> 01:31:24.234
- And I don't take cocaine.

01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:28.989
- Your mistake.
- My fucking mistake.

01:31:31.241 --> 01:31:35.495
Sound coming from
the rear of the limo, and Ed.

01:31:38.665 --> 01:31:39.208
Jesus!

01:31:41.627 --> 01:31:41.668
I knew Karos like to fist.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:43.003
But it sounds like he's footing, right?

01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:46.423
I'm trying... I'm trying to get
that visual out of my head.

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:49.635
Great. It's fine.
Get it all out now.

01:31:54.932 --> 01:31:55.057
-Raven's blood, falcon hair.
-Falcon hair?

01:31:56.558 --> 01:31:57.976
Here we go.

01:32:01.021 --> 01:32:01.063
Bring me Wilford Brimley's mustache.

01:32:02.856 --> 01:32:03.398
- Oh shit!

01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:09.196
Wilford, Wilford, give me your treat.

01:32:14.326 --> 01:32:14.368
I'll lick you sour or lick you sweet.

01:32:17.371 --> 01:32:17.454
That's amazing.

01:32:20.624 --> 01:32:20.707
Oh, man!  Do it again.

01:32:25.212 --> 01:32:26.004
- Arnie Hanger?

01:32:28.257 --> 01:32:28.340
-All right, you got it.
-Arnie. I got it, I got it.

01:32:29.925 --> 01:32:30.008
Okay.

01:32:31.385 --> 01:32:32.386
-No, they're not the same person.
-Yes, they are. Do you know...

01:32:33.804 --> 01:32:34.388
-No, you got it. Come on.
-I got it.

01:32:36.056 --> 01:32:36.223
-They're...
-Do you know who Arnie Hanger is?

01:32:37.349 --> 01:32:37.641
--You got it.

01:32:39.309 --> 01:32:39.560
This is the best thing.

01:32:41.645 --> 01:32:44.064
Still rolling, guys.

01:32:47.067 --> 01:32:47.109
He just saved the whole movie right there.

01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:49.653
Scotch?

01:32:52.948 --> 01:32:54.157
- Weedos?

01:32:56.702 --> 01:32:56.869
What the hell are weedos?

01:32:59.246 --> 01:33:00.080
It's like a 10-minute ride, dude.
Let me Jigga Jay-Z this motherfucker.

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.165
-Fifty bucks per block.
-That's like 10 blocks, dude.

01:33:03.625 --> 01:33:03.750
Come on, you're about to sign
a big recording contract, boy.

01:33:12.759 --> 01:33:12.885
The first one was better.

01:33:14.761 --> 01:33:15.554
You're gonna see some shit up close
you've never seen before.

01:33:16.972 --> 01:33:17.055
'Cause you won't be able to.

01:33:20.767 --> 01:33:20.976
Won't be able to see it?

01:33:23.604 --> 01:33:23.687
- Fuck! Motherfucker!

01:33:25.689 --> 01:33:33.405
- What's up, baby? Yeah, yeah!

01:33:36.074 --> 01:33:36.950
Oh! Ow, it burns!

01:33:38.243 --> 01:33:40.913
Put rotating parallels on his ass
because straight tails...

01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.832
And action.  Cut.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.835
- What a dick.

01:33:49.254 --> 01:33:50.339
We should probably
find our marks at this point.

01:33:51.798 --> 01:33:51.924
Or not.

01:33:53.467 --> 01:33:55.844
- Where's Leon?

01:33:57.262 --> 01:33:57.304
What are you doing, Leon?

01:33:59.973 --> 01:34:00.057
Arnie Hanger is his lover.

01:34:03.477 --> 01:34:03.519
You're gonna need some tampons.

01:34:08.732 --> 01:34:08.815
-Fuck!
-No, we're good, we're good.

01:34:11.026 --> 01:34:11.109
See? Wilford Brimley.
