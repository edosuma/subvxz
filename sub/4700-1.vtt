02:49.544 --> 02:52.087
That's a nice boy.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.214
Go get him, Dulli.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.342
Get in.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.476
- We good?
- Oh, yeah.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.396
Are we good? Yeah, we're good.
We're beautiful.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.231
We're perfect.

03:11.399 --> 03:15.485
This is Grade A, 100-percent pure
Colombian cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.154
Disco shit.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.781
Pure as the driven snow.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.950
My name is George Jung...

03:22.118 --> 03:26.121
...federal inmate number 19225004.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.125
I was born in New England.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.170
Massachusetts, actually,
in a town called Weymouth.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.965
That's me.
And that's my best friend, Tuna.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.052
My dad ran a plumbing
and heating company.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.889
He had three trucks, 10 employees
and did big jobs.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.474
- Hey.
He was my hero.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.267
- Did you do it?
- Yeah, I didn't fall once.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.646
Attaboy. See you tonight.
- Can I please come to work with you?

03:50.813 --> 03:53.315
Hey, come on, Fred. Let's go, huh?
Say goodbye to the kid.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.775
Clam it, Bill.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.528
I'll talk to my boy as long as I want to.
You got a problem with that?

04:03.076 --> 04:05.035
You really wanna come?

04:07.497 --> 04:08.997
Oh, what the heck? All right.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.085
- All right, get your boots.
Thanks, Dad. Thanks.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.004
Bill, what's your problem?

04:16.172 --> 04:18.923
Guess who's on cleanup today.
And buying lunch.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.802
Money! M-O-N-E-Y.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.972
Dad was a hard worker,
but didn't make enough to keep Mom happy.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.473
Why do you think I married you?

04:26.641 --> 04:28.976
She'd thought she'd married
above her class.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.436
And he'd promised her the moon
but didn't deliver.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.814
- How we will live?
The truth was...

04:33.982 --> 04:35.691
...business got slow and we were broke.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.193
Don't you touch me!
Look at your hands. You're disgusting.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.863
Please, not in front of the boy.
The boy. What about me, Fred?

04:42.031 --> 04:44.658
Mom, wait, where are you going?
- Go home, George!

04:44.826 --> 04:46.326
Mom, where are you going?

04:46.494 --> 04:48.996
No matter how many times
my mother would leave...

04:49.163 --> 04:51.581
...no matter how many times
she embarrassed him...

04:51.749 --> 04:53.333
Mom!

04:54.961 --> 04:57.212
...he always took her back.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.381
He loved her.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.049
God, he loved her.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.926
Ermine.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.305
Come here.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.307
- Are you okay?
Yeah.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.850
You all right?
Yeah.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.147
Hi, George.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.898
I'm home.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.067
Come on, give me a hug.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.033
Come on, Georgie.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.076
Come to Mommy.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.704
George.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.415
Come give your mother a hug.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.091
For 10 years...

05:43.259 --> 05:47.679
...my father worked his ass off
14 hours a day, seven days a week.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.766
He didn't care,
as long as we were happy.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.393
Okay, well, what do I have to do?

05:54.103 --> 05:56.438
But in the end, he didn't make enough...

05:56.606 --> 05:59.941
...slowly but surely lost everything.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.902
We were bankrupt.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.029
Let's get some ice cream.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.448
No, Dad,
I don't care about ice cream right now.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.283
What are we gonna do?

06:08.451 --> 06:10.160
It'll be all right, George.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.746
It'll work out. It always does.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.706
I'm gonna find another job.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.459
Look, George, this is the way it goes.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.753
Sometimes you're flush
and sometimes you're bust.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.963
And when you're up,
it's never as good as it seems.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.633
And when you're down,
you never think you're gonna be up again.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.178
But life goes on. Remember that.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.764
Money isn't real, George.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.433
It doesn't matter.
It only seems like it does.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.602
Yeah, tell that to Mom.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.940
Yeah. That's gonna be a tricky one.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.526
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

06:42.693 --> 06:45.987
Are we gonna be poor?
Because I don't ever wanna be poor.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.657
Then you won't.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.703
I decided right then and there
I wasn't gonna live like that.

06:53.871 --> 06:57.332
I needed to get as far away as possible.

07:02.422 --> 07:06.883
I moved to California
in the summer of 1968 with the Tuna.

07:07.051 --> 07:10.011
We had $300 and a black TR3.

07:10.179 --> 07:14.516
Sure was nothing like this back home.
It was paradise.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.687
We got a small one-bedroom apartment
right on the beach.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.232
It wasn't much, but it had its perks.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.446
George.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.197
George?

07:31.534 --> 07:33.702
You need some help?

07:41.419 --> 07:43.712
California was like nothing
I'd ever seen before.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.547
Hey, where's the beer?

07:45.715 --> 07:48.633
People were liberated,
independent, full of new ideas.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.135
Hi, George, Tuna.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.222
They used words like
"right on," "groovy," "solid."

07:54.724 --> 07:56.224
The women were beautiful.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.562
And they all seemed
to share the same occupation.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.483
- I'm a stewardess.
- I'm a stewardess.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.942
Yeah.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.986
On the airplane.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.282
And everyone was getting stoned.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.114
Hi.
- Hello. Hi. Hello.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.783
Hey, Tuna.

08:54.951 --> 08:55.951
Hi.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.537
Oh, my God.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.835
I figured it out.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.462
Figured out what?

09:07.630 --> 09:10.382
You know how we were wondering
what we were gonna do for money...

09:10.550 --> 09:12.008
...being as we don't wanna get jobs?

09:12.176 --> 09:13.969
Yeah.
- Check this out.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.935
Oregano?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.813
- Tuna, this is crap.
Look, we're selling it.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.440
We'll make up three-finger lids
and sell them on the beach.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.819
If we move that, we got, like...
Like, a hundred bucks.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.446
And if we don't, well, we can smoke it.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.031
You got ripped off, pal.

09:35.199 --> 09:38.118
It's not a bad idea, man.
I got the baggies and everything.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.997
Look, if you really wanna score some dope,
I got the guy.

09:42.707 --> 09:47.168
The guy was Derek Foreal,
a Manhattan Beach legend.

09:47.336 --> 09:50.589
He owned three restaurants, two nightclubs,
and chain of Laundromats.

09:50.756 --> 09:55.594
But more importantly, he owned the first
male hair salon in all of southern California.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.928
Barbie.

09:57.513 --> 09:58.847
- Hey.
- Mwah.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.016
Maria.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.517
Mwah, mwah.

10:02.685 --> 10:03.727
Hey.

10:03.894 --> 10:04.978
Hey, Sandy.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.939
Ah, so this is the new man, huh?
He's cute.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.984
George.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.361
Tuna.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.488
Hello, Tuna.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.283
Enchanté, George.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.413
Barbie, he is yummy.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.373
He looks just like a Ken doll.

10:25.541 --> 10:30.712
Huh! Ken and Barbie.
Oh, my God, it is so perfect.

10:31.422 --> 10:36.259
Girls, give me about five minutes.
I wanna talk alone to the boys.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.137
Have fun.
- Gentlemen?

10:44.101 --> 10:46.353
All right, everybody, shoo. Come on.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.648
Chop, chop. Give us a few minutes.
Chop, chop, chop.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.232
Go blond, Ron.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.693
Very nice, Heather.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.157
Now what can I do for you, guys?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.871
We'd like to buy some pot.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.291
I know what you want.

11:08.751 --> 11:12.087
- But first, are you cops?
No.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.590
If you are, you have to tell me.
If not, it's entrapment.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.843
We're not cops.
We're from Massachusetts.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.763
Does he look like a cop?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.724
Actually, no.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.979
You know, it's a good thing
you're friends of Barbie's.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.940
Because if you weren't...

11:33.734 --> 11:36.236
...I would never talk to you.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.286
What the fuck is that?

11:46.080 --> 11:47.997
It's your pot.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.624
Wow.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.793
That's more than we had in mind.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.421
I don't nickel-and-dime.
You want it or not?

11:54.797 --> 11:56.423
We'll take it.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.606
Tuna and I became the kings
of Manhattan Beach.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.485
If you bought grass,
you bought it from us.

12:17.862 --> 12:21.573
The bills were paid and I was making
way more money than I could at a real job.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.659
I built a reputation for myself.

12:24.827 --> 12:29.164
People even started calling me
"Boston George."

12:29.331 --> 12:31.332
It was perfect.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.338
This is it for me.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.799
What is it?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.676
Everything.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.263
You, California, the beach.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.640
This spot right here.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.853
I just finally feel like I belong somewhere,
you know?

12:52.188 --> 12:53.938
I feel right.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.358
You're happy.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.861
Yeah, I am.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.863
You?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.783
Um, mm-hm.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.327
Good.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.963
Look what the cat dragged in.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.382
Holy shit, Dulli.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.093
George.
- Hey.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.223
Man.
- What the fuck are you doing out here?

13:28.390 --> 13:30.683
Man, I'll tell you.
I was walking down the beach.

13:30.851 --> 13:34.854
I was minding my business, right?
Who do I see? This fucking guy.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.650
- I didn't know you were in California.
- What are you doing out here?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.026
On vacation, man.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.028
I'm on my way back to school.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.156
Oh. Well, this calls for a joint.
You wanna do the honors?

13:45.324 --> 13:46.741
No, man.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.410
- I'm too fucked up.
- That's nice weed, huh?

13:49.578 --> 13:50.912
Fuck, yeah.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.207
I've never seen anything like this.
I'm fucking wasted.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.000
Right on.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.296
Man.

14:03.133 --> 14:07.095
I'm fucking stoned.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.932
I'm fucking really stoned.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.226
I'm fucking stoned, man. I'm really...

14:14.395 --> 14:15.854
Stoned?

14:16.981 --> 14:19.566
- Yeah, ha, ha.
- Yeah.

14:19.733 --> 14:23.278
Man, I wish there was stuff like this
back at home.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.487
Yeah?

14:24.655 --> 14:28.700
Fuck, yeah. You know how much money
you can make with this stuff back east?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.035
- Yeah?
No shit, Kev?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.121
- That's right.
Yeah?

14:33.289 --> 14:35.540
When there's stuff to move,
it's too easy not to.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.793
Do you know how many colleges there are
within a 60-mile radius?

14:39.253 --> 14:42.338
- UMASS, Amherst, BU.
Smith, Hampshire.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.007
And Holyoke.
Holyoke.

14:44.174 --> 14:47.385
There's 100,000 rich kids
with their parents' money to spend.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.179
There's never anything around.
Nothing good, anyways.

14:50.347 --> 14:53.433
I'm spending 400 bucks on shit.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.934
Yeah?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.022
The way I figure it...

14:59.189 --> 15:01.649
...Barbara flies back east twice a week.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.484
Two bags per flight.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.486
Twenty-five pounds in each bag.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.280
That's a hundred pounds a week.

15:07.448 --> 15:11.534
I know it's a lot of weight,
but you can't get pot like this back home.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.289
I'm telling you, Derek, it'll sell.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.333
I don't know.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.460
The best pot...

15:20.794 --> 15:22.587
...you can charge 500 a pound.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.048
Come on, George.
No one's gonna pay that.

15:25.215 --> 15:29.218
It's already been negotiated. It's done.
The money's there waiting.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.012
Goodness.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.056
Goodness is right.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.017
Listen...

15:38.062 --> 15:40.480
...I want you to be my partner
on this thing, Derek.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.940
Fifty-fifty.

15:42.107 --> 15:45.693
If you do the math,
that's over 30 grand a week profit.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.821
That's $15,000 a week for you,
my friend.

15:48.989 --> 15:52.033
In your pocket, free and clear.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.576
And I just deal with you.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.287
Barbara and me. No one else.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.873
It's gonna work, Derek.

16:01.877 --> 16:05.129
I don't know. East Coast, airplanes.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.382
I'm paranoid. It seems really risky.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.467
Derek, she's a stewardess.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.053
They don't check her bags.

16:24.566 --> 16:25.858
- Bye, dear.
- Bye.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.576
There she is.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.205
- Hey, Barbara.
- Kevin.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.924
See this suit? Japanese.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.096
See you.
Bye.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.305
Barbara.
- Kevin.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.016
How've you been?
- Hey.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.435
More. I need more.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.986
Bye.
Barbara. Hey.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.945
- Hey, Kevin.
- I need more.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.614
I need more.

17:13.781 --> 17:15.199
What do you want me to do?

17:15.367 --> 17:18.327
I can only carry two bags
and I can't fly back here every day.

17:18.494 --> 17:22.248
I know. I got a feeding frenzy on my hands.
You tell George this is small potatoes.

17:22.415 --> 17:26.169
We're missing out on some serious cash.
You tell George. He'll think of something.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.627
- I will.
- Good.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.653
Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Dulli.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.156
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, nine...

17:55.324 --> 17:57.408
Twenty, 40, 60, 80. A thousand.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.368
Hundred twenty-eight thousand dollars.

17:59.536 --> 18:03.289
Jesus Christ,
I'm getting a boner just looking at her.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.999
You believe it, George?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.712
What's the matter, George?
Something wrong?

18:09.880 --> 18:13.883
Man, cheer up. I mean, half of this is ours.
We're fucking rich.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.511
- It's not enough.
- What?

18:16.678 --> 18:18.387
The fuck are you talking about?

18:18.555 --> 18:19.931
Setup is wrong.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.184
We're doing all the legwork.
At the end of the day, we're paying retail.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.394
- We're getting fucking middled.
So?

18:25.562 --> 18:27.230
So we need to get to the source.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.190
Source? What about Derek?

18:29.358 --> 18:30.650
He's getting middled too.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.568
And Derek's our partner.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.029
What's good for him is good for us.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.865
So we need a source.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.742
Where do we start?

18:42.830 --> 18:45.498
Either one of you guys speak Spanish?

18:53.715 --> 18:56.300
Tuna! Get the fuck in there!

18:56.468 --> 18:57.802
Go on and play.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.181
Yeah!

19:08.105 --> 19:09.230
Cheers.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.233
Cómo, marijuana?

19:13.652 --> 19:15.403
Smoking? Smoke them?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.572
Do you have some pot?

19:17.739 --> 19:20.908
Dónde estápot?

19:21.076 --> 19:23.411
- Do you know where we can get pot?
- No. No idea.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.205
El weed.

19:26.373 --> 19:29.250
Where we can find some marijuana?
We're looking for marijuana.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.921
Take a little off the top.
You know what I mean?

19:34.089 --> 19:36.507
Smoke, man. Marijuana?
Excuse me, do you smoke?

19:40.637 --> 19:41.929
So you got anything?

19:42.097 --> 19:43.639
I haven't asked.
What?

19:43.807 --> 19:46.100
I didn't ask yet. Go ahead.

19:50.772 --> 19:51.814
Hey, George.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.357
Come on.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.154
We'll be back.
Okay.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.050
Santiago?

20:35.984 --> 20:36.984
George.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.620
Ramon tells me
you're looking for some mota.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.497
Yeah, I am.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.464
For instance, say, something like this, eh?

20:58.632 --> 21:01.592
Ahem. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that'll do it.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.636
I'll take it.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.184
You're funny.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.435
Really.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.562
How much will you be needing?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.023
All of it.

21:16.858 --> 21:19.193
Yeah, I'll come back in a week
with a plane.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.241
Maybe we're going too fast.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.536
You take a little and then come back.

21:29.204 --> 21:32.707
Yeah, but I don't need a little.
I need a lot.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.426
Hang on a minute. Hang on. Hang on.
Listen, señor.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.219
Tell you what, amigo.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.305
What about I come back...

21:47.472 --> 21:49.515
...and I bring you, say...

21:49.766 --> 21:51.309
...fifty thousand dollars?

21:52.060 --> 21:54.228
That alleviate some of your concerns?

21:54.396 --> 21:55.604
Amigo...

21:55.772 --> 22:00.318
...you bring me $50,000
and I have no more concerns.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.865
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.325
Don't be such a pussy.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.869
We're not fucking stealing it.
We're borrowing it.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.663
Oops. Be cool, boys.
Got a little company here.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.381
Smoke.
Come on, let's go. Tuna?

22:22.549 --> 22:24.925
Let's go. Tuna.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.471
- Good luck, boys. I'll see you in the desert.
All right.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.432
- You sure you know what you're doing?
Relax, all right?

22:31.600 --> 22:33.559
I've flown with my old man
a million times.

22:33.727 --> 22:37.355
It's not the, ahh, taking-off part
you got to worry about. It's the landing.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.190
Okay.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.268
Hi. How are you?
- Good to see you.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.062
You are a man of your word.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.107
Oh, listen,
you know the 50,000 I promised you?

23:22.651 --> 23:24.276
Couldn't get it.

23:26.488 --> 23:29.073
So I brought you 75 instead.

23:46.466 --> 23:50.553
George! Whoo!

23:54.641 --> 23:55.891
George.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.435
Merry Christmas, Derek.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.438
Merry Christmas.

24:02.899 --> 24:05.192
It's beautiful.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.490
You're a genius, George.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.826
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.371
This would make a fabulous
Christmas card.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.039
Get my camera, Sven.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.419
George!

24:23.587 --> 24:25.212
Did you see the bedroom?

24:25.380 --> 24:28.215
I love it. It's so pretty.

24:28.383 --> 24:30.217
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.427
Hi.
- Hi.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.387
Oh, my God.
- What do you think?

24:33.555 --> 24:34.555
Are you kidding?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.223
- Yeah, you want it?
- Mm-hm.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.184
- We'll take it.
- All right.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.658
It was a great time in our lives.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.535
The seven of us were like a family.

24:57.037 --> 25:00.414
We worked hard, we played hard,
didn't have a care in the world.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.541
Egg roll!

25:02.709 --> 25:04.460
It was perfect.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.399
I can't get over
the size of that ring. I just love it.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.944
Look at it, Fred.
Tell me you don't love that ring.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.446
I'm happy that George
has found somebody he cares for.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.282
Yes, of course.
But I'm talking about the ring.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.992
It's something else, let me tell you.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.661
George has exquisite taste.

25:38.828 --> 25:41.622
What is it? Two carats?
It's gotta be at least two carats.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.999
I don't know.
- Yes, it's definitely two carats.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.209
Treasure it, darling.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.754
- George, you might wanna get that insured.
- Okay, Mom.

25:48.922 --> 25:52.591
Hard to imagine being able to afford a ring
like that on a construction salary.

25:53.677 --> 25:57.429
Oh, shut up, Fred. Shut your big fat mouth.
You don't buy it all at once.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.306
It's called layaway.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.141
- Layaway, shmayaway.
- Yes, layaway.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.644
Something you wouldn't know
anything about, cheapskate.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.605
Cheapskate, beapskate.
- Yeah, you, you big old tightwad.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.649
He still has his Communion money.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.693
- Don't listen to her.
- George, tell your father...

26:10.860 --> 26:12.820
Yap, yap, yap.

26:12.988 --> 26:16.156
George, you tell your father
about layaway.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.659
- Layaway.
- Okay.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.328
The boy's happy, Fred.
Don't be such a killjoy.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.163
I'm not a killjoy.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.498
Oh, Jesus. Babe.

26:24.666 --> 26:25.708
- Put your head back.
- Ahh!

26:25.875 --> 26:28.627
Put your head back.
- Why, Barbara.

26:28.795 --> 26:31.255
My God.
Here, take my napkin.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.048
Is she all right?
- Yeah.

26:33.216 --> 26:36.302
- I'll get you ice. Irene, we need ice here.
- Yeah, she's all right.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.554
- You know what? You wanna go?
- Yeah, let's go.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.683
- Oh, come on. You haven't had your entrée.
- No, it's okay. It's better.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.184
George...
- I'll leave the tip.

26:44.352 --> 26:46.020
- George, no.
- Hope you feel better.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.354
It was lovely to meet you.

26:47.522 --> 26:50.649
- Give your mother a call in the morning.
Okay, Mom.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.945
What a lovely girl.

26:55.238 --> 26:58.032
- Is that all hundreds?
- Yeah.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.037
Are you sure you're all right?

27:03.204 --> 27:04.622
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

27:04.789 --> 27:08.042
Honey, would you be bummed out
if I didn't go to Chicago with you?

27:08.209 --> 27:11.378
No, not if you don't wanna.

27:12.255 --> 27:15.841
Listen, I gotta apologize about my parents.
That was...

27:16.009 --> 27:18.218
They weren't that bad.
They were kind of cute.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.388
I'm not sure about that.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.850
I want you to promise me something.

27:25.018 --> 27:28.145
I want you to promise me
that we're never gonna be like that.

27:28.688 --> 27:31.065
I don't wanna wind up like them.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.152
We're gonna wind up like us.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.030
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.242
- I love you.
- In the car.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.204
Hurry before they come out.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.921
George Jung,
you stand accused of...

27:54.089 --> 27:59.176
...possession of 660 pounds of marijuana
with intent to distribute.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.678
How do you plead?

28:03.056 --> 28:06.058
Your Honor, I'd like to say a few words
to the court, if I may?

28:06.226 --> 28:09.561
You're gonna have to stop slouching
and stand up to address this court, sir.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.271
All right. Fine.

28:11.439 --> 28:12.898
Well...

28:13.692 --> 28:15.275
...in all honesty...

28:15.443 --> 28:17.736
...I don't feel that what I've done
is a crime.

28:17.904 --> 28:22.199
And I think it's illogical and irresponsible
for you to sentence me to prison.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.868
Because when you think about it,
what did I really do?

28:25.036 --> 28:27.913
I crossed an imaginary line
with a bunch of plants.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.332
I mean, "You say I'm an outlaw.
You say I'm a thief.

28:30.500 --> 28:34.420
But where's the Christmas dinner
for the people on relief, huh?

28:34.587 --> 28:37.089
You say you're looking for someone
who's never weak but always strong...

28:37.257 --> 28:39.508
...to gather flowers constantly,
whether you were right or wrong...

28:39.676 --> 28:43.303
...someone to open each and every door,
but it ain't me, babe, huh?

28:43.805 --> 28:47.224
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe."

28:47.392 --> 28:48.559
You follow?

28:48.727 --> 28:50.144
Yeah.

28:51.646 --> 28:55.441
Gosh, you know, your concepts
are really interesting, Mr. Jung.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.484
Thank you.

28:57.652 --> 29:00.320
Unfortunately for you,
the line you crossed was real...

29:00.488 --> 29:05.784
...and the plants you brought with you
were illegal, so your bail is $20,000.

29:06.494 --> 29:07.745
Next case, Your Honor.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.830
- Number 14173.
- No.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.802
George.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.346
- George.
- Hey, babe.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.182
What are you doing here?

29:29.350 --> 29:31.101
Surprise.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.937
You didn't have to come
all the way out here, babe.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.898
What, and miss all the fun?

29:36.065 --> 29:37.316
Not a chance.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.693
So...

29:40.111 --> 29:42.070
...what's the verdict?

29:43.323 --> 29:45.574
The lawyer says he can, uh...

29:46.201 --> 29:48.243
...plead it down to five years.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.329
I'll serve two.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.833
- Two years.
- Yeah.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.543
Two years.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.546
George, I can't wait that long.

30:01.090 --> 30:04.760
What, are you kidding me?
You're not gonna wait for me? Fuck is that?

30:06.971 --> 30:08.639
I...

30:08.807 --> 30:10.974
I don't have two years.

30:13.269 --> 30:14.686
What?

30:26.491 --> 30:27.825
No.

31:32.974 --> 31:36.268
Losing Barbara to cancer
changed everything.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.479
The old gang broke up.

31:39.814 --> 31:43.483
Tuna stayed in Mexico.
God only knows what happened to him.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.320
Point is, we all lost touch.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.740
I'd skipped bail in Chicago
to take care of Barbara...

31:49.908 --> 31:52.659
...and was now a fugitive on the run.

31:53.953 --> 31:57.331
It'd been almost a year
since I'd seen my parents.

31:57.665 --> 32:00.500
And believe it or not,
I actually missed them.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.469
Hi, Ma.

32:14.682 --> 32:16.558
Surprised to see me?

32:18.811 --> 32:20.604
Take off your boots.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.076
You're tan.

32:34.243 --> 32:35.953
Mexico.

32:36.871 --> 32:39.539
Yeah, I heard about it.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.546
I want you to know...

32:47.382 --> 32:49.466
...I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.679
- Barbara?
- Yeah, Barbara.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.472
Nice girl.

32:56.474 --> 32:57.891
Thank you.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.487
Have you been getting the money
I send you?

33:10.905 --> 33:13.407
What, you mean the drug money?

33:14.409 --> 33:16.576
Yeah, I got it.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.292
Oh, God.

33:29.590 --> 33:33.385
What are you doing, huh?
What are you doing?

33:33.761 --> 33:36.054
It's okay, Mom.
George?

33:36.431 --> 33:37.431
It's okay, Mom.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.099
Georgie.
- Hi, Pop.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.852
George, I thought I heard something.
How are you?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.603
- How are you?
Good.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.480
Oh, son, come on in.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.941
How are you? You look good.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.618
May the wind always be at your back...

33:58.786 --> 34:00.287
...and the sun upon your face.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.789
And may the winds of destiny
carry you aloft...

34:02.957 --> 34:04.624
...to dance with the stars.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.294
- Cheers, Georgie.
- Cheers, Pop.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.976
Are you all right?

34:26.647 --> 34:28.940
Just low, you know?

34:29.150 --> 34:31.109
You really loved her.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.739
Yeah, Dad.

34:35.989 --> 34:37.783
I really did.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.125
Are you mad at me?

34:48.168 --> 34:50.504
Uh-uh. No.

34:50.670 --> 34:52.255
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

34:52.422 --> 34:55.717
- I can tell by the way you're looking at me.
- I'm not mad, George.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.513
I just don't understand
what you're doing.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.975
I don't understand your choices. You know,
the goddamn cops are looking for you.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.353
I know.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.532
I'm great at what I do, Dad.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.952
I mean, I'm really great at what I do.

35:25.039 --> 35:27.374
Let me tell you something, George.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.544
You'd have been great at anything.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.212
Anything.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.723
Fuck. Damn.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.684
George!

35:46.561 --> 35:48.395
Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.040
I had no choice.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.087
Don't look at me like that.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.755
Let's go.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.091
- What? What was I supposed to do?
- Jesus Christ, Ermine.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.885
- He's in our house!
- Shut up. Shut up.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.596
What, was I supposed to be
an accomplice?

36:23.639 --> 36:27.100
You don't think people know
you're a drug dealer?

36:27.268 --> 36:30.854
Everyone knows you're a drug dealer.
It's no secret.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.523
How do you think that reflects on me?

36:33.691 --> 36:36.610
Every time I go out, I'm humiliated.

36:37.278 --> 36:40.864
So you go to jail. It's for your own good.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.159
You need to straighten your life out!

36:50.625 --> 36:54.669
What are you looking at, Mrs. Gracie?
Your son's no prize.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.139
Stop.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.141
Open up Cell Number 3!

37:12.605 --> 37:14.522
Prisoner is in.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.067
Close Cell Number 3.

37:24.700 --> 37:29.120
Hello. My name is Diego Delgado.
How do you do?

37:29.997 --> 37:31.623
Okay.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.253
Hey, George.
What?

37:36.420 --> 37:38.588
If you don't mind me asking...

37:39.173 --> 37:41.341
...what is the reason
you are in this place?

37:42.718 --> 37:44.803
I don't wanna talk about it.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.515
Oh, come on, George.

37:50.142 --> 37:52.769
If we are to be friends,
we must trust each other.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.648
- I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Me too, yeah.

37:56.816 --> 38:00.360
Too much blah-blah-blah. You know?

38:00.945 --> 38:02.779
But we are roommates.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.698
And we must talk to each other.

38:06.617 --> 38:09.703
I'm arrested for stealing cars.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.039
For the grand theft auto.

38:16.585 --> 38:23.550
Murder.

38:35.771 --> 38:38.273
What do you got down there, Diego?

38:38.941 --> 38:42.235
Nothing. Just a little project.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.572
What kind of little project?

38:48.075 --> 38:49.784
Never mind.

38:49.952 --> 38:51.995
Not for you to worry.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.750
Come on. I thought you said
we're supposed to be roommates...

38:56.917 --> 38:59.085
...tell each other everything,
all that kind of shit.

38:59.253 --> 39:00.337
Uh-huh.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.590
You have your intrigues, I have mine.

39:06.927 --> 39:09.512
Today is a happy day for me, George.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.641
In nine months from today,
I'll be in Medellin, sipping champagne.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.477
In nine months...

39:15.644 --> 39:17.228
...I'm free.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.107
I'm happy for you.

39:22.401 --> 39:23.777
Yeah.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.279
How much time do you have?

39:26.447 --> 39:29.282
Oh, let's see.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.620
Twenty-six months.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.084
Twenty-six months?

39:39.710 --> 39:41.294
For murder?

39:45.132 --> 39:46.716
I must meet your lawyer.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.553
I gotta get out of here, Diego.

39:54.308 --> 39:57.310
Only two ways I know
to leave here early.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.021
One...

40:00.398 --> 40:01.898
...is to escape.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.570
Okay, what's the other?

40:09.657 --> 40:12.659
Uh...
I guess we ought to open our books.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.870
Man, fuck you.
We ain't opening shit.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.832
That's right.
You're the warden's little bitch.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.835
We're hip to you.
Doing that shit to get some time cut off.

40:22.002 --> 40:24.087
What the fuck? Why not?

40:24.338 --> 40:27.465
Listen, I wanna get out of this shithole
as quickly as fucking possible.

40:27.633 --> 40:31.845
But for me to walk early,
some of you has got to graduate.

40:32.012 --> 40:34.222
You should forget it. You're hopeless.
Go to sleep.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.225
Fuck you. See you in the shower.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.435
Jive-ass turkey.

40:38.602 --> 40:41.062
The rest of you guys
might be able to get diplomas...

40:41.230 --> 40:43.523
...and get jobs when you get back
on the outside.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.316
Shit, I'm in this bitch for life.

40:45.484 --> 40:49.362
Motherfucker, I'm a criminal.
Ain't nobody giving me no fucking job.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.614
Well...

40:52.366 --> 40:54.534
...let's learn some criminal shit too.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.454
Tell you what, I'll make you a deal.

40:57.955 --> 41:01.374
What about half the time I teach you
about this George Washington character...

41:01.542 --> 41:03.543
...the other half...

41:03.711 --> 41:05.545
...I'll teach you how to smuggle drugs.

41:05.921 --> 41:08.715
You don't know dick
about smuggling no drugs.

41:08.883 --> 41:10.425
Oh, no?

41:10.593 --> 41:14.137
I was arrested in Chicago
with 660 pounds of grass.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.389
I think that qualifies me.

41:16.557 --> 41:19.267
How'd the fuck you get
660 pounds of weed?

41:19.435 --> 41:22.854
Flew in from Mexico
on a single-engine Cessna.

41:23.230 --> 41:25.231
So we got a deal or what?

41:25.566 --> 41:27.233
Hey, George.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.528
George.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.238
What?

41:32.907 --> 41:36.743
I listened to what you say
to the class today about the smuggling.

41:37.119 --> 41:39.621
Never believed you were a murderer.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.749
I knew you were a mágico.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.752
I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.797
Do you know in my country
I'm a mágico?

41:49.965 --> 41:51.674
A man with a dream.

41:51.842 --> 41:53.968
A man on the rise.

41:54.178 --> 41:57.764
To take nothing and make it something.

41:58.224 --> 41:59.807
Do you have a dream, George?

41:59.975 --> 42:02.060
Well, I would if I could get
some fucking sleep.

42:03.562 --> 42:05.605
You have a dream.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.651
And maybe you will accomplish it.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.070
But yet you failed.

42:12.238 --> 42:13.696
Why?

42:13.864 --> 42:16.950
- Because I got caught.
- No.

42:17.117 --> 42:19.160
You failed...

42:19.370 --> 42:22.956
...because you had the wrong dream.

42:28.170 --> 42:29.546
George?

42:31.715 --> 42:34.509
What do you know about cocaine?

42:36.136 --> 42:39.055
First of all,
what type of planes do you have?

42:39.223 --> 42:43.643
They're, uh, four-passenger,
single-engine Cessnas.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.311
Four passengers.

42:45.479 --> 42:47.480
So that means...

42:47.648 --> 42:50.900
...how many kilos can we fit
in these planes?

42:51.402 --> 42:53.653
I don't know. Probably, uh, 100, 150...

42:53.821 --> 42:55.905
Danbury wasn't a prison.

42:56.073 --> 42:58.324
It was a crime school.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.160
I went in with a bachelor of marijuana...

43:01.328 --> 43:04.247
...came out with a doctorate of cocaine.

43:05.374 --> 43:09.836
And after 16 months,
I was once again a free man.

43:10.004 --> 43:13.965
Well, not altogether free.
The conditions of my parole...

43:14.133 --> 43:17.260
...were that I had to live
at my parents' house and find a job.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.470
Hello.
- Diego Delgado, please.

43:20.848 --> 43:23.057
- Diego, George.
Boston George.

43:23.225 --> 43:26.019
- Today is the day. Are you out?
- Yeah, I'm out.

43:26.186 --> 43:28.187
Congratulations.
I've been waiting for you.

43:28.355 --> 43:30.064
- How we doing?
Fine.

43:30.232 --> 43:32.900
Everything's perfect down here.
Everything is all set up.

43:33.068 --> 43:35.570
Do we need a plane?
How does this work? When do I see you?

43:35.738 --> 43:38.031
Slow down, Georgie.
You need to come down here.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.533
Everybody meets everybody.

43:40.701 --> 43:44.370
We do one for good faith
and then we talk about airplanes, okay?

43:44.538 --> 43:46.372
- I can't go anyway, Diego.
- Georgie.

43:46.540 --> 43:49.459
- It's nice and cold.
- All right, Pop. One minute.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.461
I'm on parole. I can't leave the state.

43:51.629 --> 43:55.340
But, George, you'll be back
before they know you're gone.

43:55.507 --> 43:57.050
I just got released five minutes ago...

43:57.217 --> 44:00.637
George, are we gonna do this or not?

44:09.104 --> 44:10.938
- My friend.
Hey. How are you?

44:11.106 --> 44:13.441
- Fine.
- Good to see you.

44:14.985 --> 44:16.152
Okay.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.904
Fifteen kilos it is then, okay?

44:19.156 --> 44:22.909
We receive $100,000 upon delivery.

44:23.077 --> 44:26.579
Not so fast. No, no, no.
I would like to go over the details.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.251
What details?

44:32.461 --> 44:36.464
I put the coke in the false bottoms
and I take it through customs.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.007
That's it.

44:39.843 --> 44:41.552
Tell me about the suitcases.

44:41.970 --> 44:45.056
- Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
- What?

44:45.432 --> 44:46.933
Clothes.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.185
In the suitcase.

44:51.772 --> 44:54.273
Yeah, okay.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.110
Okay, yeah.

44:57.277 --> 44:58.403
Let's try it. Why not?

44:58.570 --> 45:00.363
Yeah, whose clothes? Your clothes?

45:05.703 --> 45:08.454
Okay. Ahem. Diego?
What the fuck is going on here?

45:08.622 --> 45:09.956
The guy's talking about clothes.

45:10.124 --> 45:12.625
You pulled me all the way down here
to talk about clothes?

45:12.793 --> 45:14.419
I demand to know everything.

45:14.586 --> 45:17.463
I do not trust $600,000 worth of coca
to someone I don't know.

45:17.631 --> 45:20.466
It's 15 fucking kilos. I piss 15 kilos.

45:20.634 --> 45:22.427
- Hey, hey, hey.
I'm an amateur, huh?

45:22.594 --> 45:24.053
Gentlemen, please, hey.

45:24.805 --> 45:27.473
There's not need to be impolite, okay?

45:27.641 --> 45:28.766
Hey.

45:29.143 --> 45:30.309
Cesar?

45:35.524 --> 45:38.401
George, Cesar is just being thorough.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.903
And that's all, okay?

45:45.492 --> 45:47.076
Okay, very well.

45:47.494 --> 45:51.330
But just remember, Mr. Jung,
I will be with you the whole way...

45:51.498 --> 45:52.832
...and I will be watching.

46:20.486 --> 46:23.154
When you're carrying drugs
across the border...

46:23.322 --> 46:25.782
...the idea is to remain calm.

46:25.949 --> 46:29.202
The way I do it
is to think of something pleasant.

46:29.369 --> 46:34.123
A fun party, a moment of triumph,
sexual encounter.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.709
I actually project myself to that place.

46:36.877 --> 46:40.213
A little transcendental meditation,
if you will.

46:40.380 --> 46:43.216
The trick is to imagine every little detail.

46:43.383 --> 46:47.845
Anything to keep your mind off the fact that
you're going to jail for a very long time...

46:48.013 --> 46:50.932
...if they find the 15 kilos of blow
in your suitcases.

46:51.099 --> 46:52.892
Passport, please?

46:54.019 --> 46:56.562
- Nice flight?
Yeah, it was pretty good. Thanks.

46:58.106 --> 47:00.733
On vacation?
- Yes.

47:02.569 --> 47:04.028
On vacation for only one day.

47:05.572 --> 47:07.824
Oh, yeah. My brother's wedding.

47:07.991 --> 47:10.368
It was a nice ceremony and everything.
It was good.

47:11.912 --> 47:13.162
Open your bag, please?

47:16.208 --> 47:17.250
Sure.

47:24.758 --> 47:27.510
Whose clothes are these?
- Mine.

47:28.220 --> 47:29.595
And these?

47:31.890 --> 47:35.059
Old habits, you know. Hard to break.

47:38.313 --> 47:39.438
Close it up.

47:40.649 --> 47:41.941
Yes, sir.

48:00.127 --> 48:02.545
The trial period was over.

48:02.713 --> 48:06.299
It was time to start moving
some serious weight.

48:06.633 --> 48:09.135
Commercial flights weren't gonna cut it
anymore.

48:09.928 --> 48:11.304
What we needed was a pilot.

48:11.471 --> 48:12.972
I'll fly down on a Friday...

48:13.140 --> 48:15.474
...refuel in the Bahamas
and then onto Medellin.

48:26.028 --> 48:27.695
Please continue.

48:28.614 --> 48:32.325
We make the pickup,
refuel once more in the Bahamas...

48:32.492 --> 48:34.827
...then fly back on Sunday
with the mom-and-pop traffic.

48:34.995 --> 48:36.162
Why are you speaking?

48:38.165 --> 48:41.000
- What?
- You. Your responsibility is over.

48:41.168 --> 48:43.544
You don't fly.
You're not a pilot, not a distributor.

48:43.712 --> 48:46.797
You introduced us to Mr. Stevens
and the use of his plane. That's all.

48:46.965 --> 48:50.092
You make a percentage and a generous one.
And you're lucky to get that.

48:50.260 --> 48:52.094
I see.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.431
Ahem. How much?

48:55.599 --> 48:59.685
Padrino will pay 10,000 per kilo
for everyone. You, you and you.

48:59.853 --> 49:03.564
Three million. That is all.
There is no negotiation.

49:03.732 --> 49:05.149
I want two.

49:05.317 --> 49:08.861
Jack, come on, a million each
had such a nice ring to it.

49:09.029 --> 49:13.866
No way. I'm doing all the work,
I'm taking all the risk and it's my plane.

49:14.034 --> 49:17.078
You guys don't have to do shit.
You just sit back and collect your money.

49:19.039 --> 49:21.540
- You good with this?
- Ahem.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.334
Yeah.

49:28.382 --> 49:30.549
That's enough. That's enough.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.556
No! No!

49:38.433 --> 49:39.767
No!

49:44.439 --> 49:46.107
No! No.

49:46.274 --> 49:48.859
- Do you have pictures of your kids?
- What?

49:49.027 --> 49:50.486
I'll need to see them.

49:50.654 --> 49:52.405
I'll also need their names
and their schools.

49:52.572 --> 49:55.074
We're entrusting you with
millions of dollars' worth of coca.

49:55.242 --> 49:57.743
Without your children, there is no deal.

50:04.918 --> 50:06.460
Fine.

50:10.132 --> 50:11.924
Mr. Stevens?

50:13.343 --> 50:15.094
Don't forget the pictures.

50:19.474 --> 50:21.392
George.
- Huh?

50:21.560 --> 50:24.729
George, come here. I need to talk to you.
George.

50:27.232 --> 50:28.858
- George!
- Yeah, yeah. What? What?

50:29.026 --> 50:31.444
- Come here. What's the matter, George?
Nothing.

50:31.611 --> 50:33.404
I mean...

50:33.572 --> 50:36.282
...beside from the fact
that we're moving 300 fucking kilos...

50:36.450 --> 50:38.659
...and we're making dog shit,
nothing really.

50:38.827 --> 50:41.287
Million dollars for our first run isn't bad,
George.

50:41.455 --> 50:42.788
It's fucking chump change.

50:42.956 --> 50:45.791
We may be hauling suitcases
across the border. We're screwed.

50:45.959 --> 50:50.129
You know, George, this is a very small part
of business. Very small.

50:50.297 --> 50:53.966
Which reminds me,
I need a favor from you.

50:55.510 --> 51:00.765
The favor was to pick up
50 kilos of cocaine. Fifty.

51:00.932 --> 51:02.975
That's 110 pounds.

51:03.143 --> 51:05.144
Not exactly a small favor.

51:05.312 --> 51:07.480
It's not like bumming a cigarette,
for example.

51:07.647 --> 51:11.484
But what the hell, I didn't have
anything better to do that day.

51:11.651 --> 51:14.153
It's not like I was on parole or anything.

51:14.696 --> 51:18.491
How you doing?
I'm George, friend of Diego's.

51:21.286 --> 51:22.995
Where's Diego?

51:23.246 --> 51:26.207
I don't know. He sent me. I'm George.

51:26.374 --> 51:27.833
Oh.

51:28.001 --> 51:29.460
George.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.004
Well, that explains everything.

51:32.798 --> 51:34.840
Open your mouth, George.

51:35.175 --> 51:37.009
Get fucked.

51:38.011 --> 51:40.596
Open your fucking mouth.

51:44.559 --> 51:46.477
Now, you listen to me.

51:46.853 --> 51:49.522
- You hearing me, huh?
- Yeah.

51:49.689 --> 51:52.024
I've been holding 50 keys for Diego
for three weeks.

51:52.192 --> 51:54.318
You tell him I don't appreciate it.

51:54.486 --> 51:56.904
You tell him I want my money by Friday.

51:57.072 --> 51:58.781
Can you do that?

51:58.949 --> 52:02.284
- I think so.
- Heh, heh. "I think so."

52:16.758 --> 52:20.553
- Hello.
Uh, may I speak to George, please?

52:21.054 --> 52:22.638
George, you have a phone call.

52:22.806 --> 52:24.473
Okay, Mom.

52:25.809 --> 52:26.851
Thank you.

52:27.018 --> 52:29.145
- Hello?
Hello. George?

52:29.312 --> 52:31.021
- Diego.
Hey, how are you?

52:31.189 --> 52:32.565
- How are you?
I'm fine.

52:32.732 --> 52:34.733
- Where are you?
Uh, ha, ha.

52:34.901 --> 52:38.112
Uh, bad news, George. I'm in Colombia.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.780
Boy...

52:39.948 --> 52:41.740
...I sure would like to see you.

52:41.908 --> 52:43.742
And so would some of your old friends.

52:45.245 --> 52:48.914
You know, George, it's a little bit hard
to get away right now.

52:50.041 --> 52:53.419
I'm afraid you're on your own.
I'm in jail.

52:54.087 --> 52:55.337
What?

52:55.922 --> 52:57.256
Yeah.

52:57.424 --> 52:58.799
Oh.

53:03.847 --> 53:07.099
What I'm doing here
is measuring the purity.

53:07.267 --> 53:12.605
Pure coke, uh, it melts away
at about 185, 190 degrees.

53:12.772 --> 53:17.568
Cutting the agents,
they melt away at, uh, about 100...

53:17.736 --> 53:22.948
...and quality product,
well, that's, uh, melting at around 140.

53:23.950 --> 53:26.410
Hundred and thirty. Good.

53:26.828 --> 53:31.290
A hundred and forty. Yes.

53:33.251 --> 53:35.544
A hundred and fifty?

53:36.796 --> 53:39.840
Fuck me running!
A hundred and sixty?

53:40.008 --> 53:42.301
Jesus Christ, a hundred and seventy!

53:42.469 --> 53:43.928
Hundred and eighty.

53:44.095 --> 53:45.471
Hundred and...

53:46.348 --> 53:48.933
A hundred and eighty-seven.

53:49.142 --> 53:50.768
Where did you get this stuff?

53:51.478 --> 53:52.811
Colombia.

53:54.689 --> 53:56.649
Oh, uh...

53:56.983 --> 53:58.984
Well, do you mind if I do a line?

53:59.152 --> 54:00.653
Yeah, go ahead.

54:01.029 --> 54:03.030
Fuck it. Let's all do one.

54:20.006 --> 54:21.298
What did I tell you, Derek?

54:22.676 --> 54:25.761
It's great, uh, but what am I
supposed to do with all this?

54:26.888 --> 54:28.055
Sell it.

54:28.223 --> 54:30.432
Jesus Christ.
I don't see you in two years...

54:30.600 --> 54:34.186
...and you show up at my fucking door
with 110 pounds of blow?

54:34.354 --> 54:36.522
Just fucking sell it, Derek.

54:36.690 --> 54:40.359
All right, but it's gonna take me a year.

54:41.903 --> 54:44.571
I can't feel my face.

54:45.156 --> 54:48.993
I mean, I can touch it,
but I can't feel it inside.

54:54.207 --> 54:55.833
Thirty-six hours.

54:56.001 --> 54:59.503
Thirty-six hours.
I don't believe we got rid of it in 36 hours.

54:59.671 --> 55:02.548
I think it's fair to say
you underestimated the market, Derek.

55:02.716 --> 55:06.385
Right on. It's gonna take us longer
to count it than it did to sell it.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.737
- Greetings, Mr. George.
- Hola, amigos.

55:24.904 --> 55:28.407
Here you go, 1.35 million.

55:28.575 --> 55:31.035
Any place in particular
you'd like to count?

55:31.202 --> 55:32.328
On the plane.

55:32.912 --> 55:34.747
What fucking plane?

55:58.605 --> 55:59.938
Huh?

56:14.287 --> 56:15.371
Thanks.

56:16.289 --> 56:18.916
- Hey, what the fuck is going on here, huh?
Good to see you.

56:19.084 --> 56:21.960
- I thought you were in jail.
- Pablo used his influence.

56:22.128 --> 56:24.296
Now, George,
watch what you say, okay?

56:24.464 --> 56:25.756
Everybody hears everything.

56:25.924 --> 56:28.425
A lot of things get said and dónde...

56:28.593 --> 56:30.803
- Well, let's say this isn't America, okay?
- All right.

56:30.970 --> 56:33.806
Life is cheap here. No offense,
but you know what I'm saying.

56:33.973 --> 56:36.475
All right, I'll just keep my fucking mouth
shut then.

56:38.186 --> 56:41.605
Now, who's this person in California,
the connection?

56:42.315 --> 56:44.149
- It's a friend.
- Who? I need to know.

56:44.317 --> 56:46.819
It's a friend. A fucking friend, okay?
I'm not telling you.

56:46.986 --> 56:47.986
- Who?
- A friend!

56:48.154 --> 56:51.073
- I ain't telling you no more.
- Okay, we'll talk about it later.

56:53.910 --> 56:55.786
Look, that's Pablo.

57:01.751 --> 57:03.085
Oh.

57:11.928 --> 57:13.971
Oh, shit.

57:20.311 --> 57:24.857
El Padrino was Señor Pablo Escobar.

57:25.024 --> 57:28.360
And for those of you living on the moon
for the last 20 years...

57:28.528 --> 57:29.653
...he was it.

57:29.821 --> 57:31.447
The boss of it all...

57:31.614 --> 57:33.574
...el mágico.

57:34.951 --> 57:36.201
He will see you now.

57:36.369 --> 57:38.495
- Okay, let's go.
- Not you.

57:49.507 --> 57:50.841
Uh...

57:56.556 --> 57:57.890
- What?
- No. You go.

57:58.057 --> 57:59.683
- No. No, fuck, wait.
- Yeah, you go.

57:59.851 --> 58:02.227
Ahh, it's gonna be fine.
You go. You go, George.

58:02.395 --> 58:04.146
What the fuck? I'm not going over there.

58:04.314 --> 58:05.814
- Yeah.
- No, you gotta do the talking.

58:05.982 --> 58:11.278
He says Señor Escobar only wants
to see you. Not me. You go.

58:11.863 --> 58:13.697
This way, please.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

58:13.865 --> 58:15.741
Take it easy. It's gonna be fine.

58:18.328 --> 58:20.078
All right, fuck it.

58:28.463 --> 58:31.632
So you are the man, huh...

58:31.799 --> 58:36.386
...who takes 50 kilos
and made them disappear in one day?

58:36.638 --> 58:38.764
Actually, it was three days.

58:40.517 --> 58:42.768
Greetings, Mr. George.

58:42.936 --> 58:44.144
Welcome to Colombia.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.525
Oh, this man.

58:49.692 --> 58:51.818
He was full of courage.

58:51.986 --> 58:53.070
Informant?

58:55.907 --> 58:59.535
He would have run,
fled the country, gone to the policía...

59:00.161 --> 59:04.706
...but then his wife, his children,
his parents, his friends...

59:04.874 --> 59:07.084
...many people would die.

59:13.174 --> 59:15.342
Well, let me take this opportunity...

59:15.510 --> 59:18.011
...to thank you for inviting me
to your beautiful country.

59:18.179 --> 59:21.265
- Beautiful, yes. But poor.
- Yeah.

59:21.432 --> 59:25.519
Coffee, bananas, these are our main export
along with mota.

59:25.687 --> 59:30.607
We've been overrun by the fucking
comunistas, but that is another story.

59:32.402 --> 59:35.946
Our business here today is cocaine, yes?

59:36.656 --> 59:38.365
Yes, it is.

59:39.158 --> 59:43.412
I need to find an americano
who I can trust.

59:43.580 --> 59:47.791
One with, uh, honor, intelligence...

59:47.959 --> 59:51.003
You need an americano with balls,
Señor Escobar.

59:51.170 --> 59:52.504
Yes.

59:52.672 --> 59:55.007
And balls, Mr. George.

59:55.466 --> 59:56.800
Well, lookit.

59:56.968 --> 59:59.344
I can do several things for you.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:02.389
I can transport the cocaine
from your ranch here in Colombia...

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:05.017
...to the United States
starting with California.

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:07.060
I got pilots, I got planes standing by.

01:00:07.228 --> 01:00:08.979
Good, good.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.897
But I need more details.

01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:12.441
What is the cost?

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.942
Uh...

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:17.988
Right off the top of my head...
Well, I'd have to talk to Diego...

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:21.033
...but let's just say,
roughly 10,000 per kilo.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.701
Mm-hm.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.995
How much can you transport?

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:29.207
Again, this is the language that I would
have to discuss with my partner...

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:32.544
...but, uh, 300 kilos...

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:35.088
So that's $3 million.

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:37.924
This I understand.

01:00:38.092 --> 01:00:40.761
But, please, tú remove.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:45.140
- Yeah.
- This complications with Diego.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.018
The stolen cars,
getting him released from the cárcel.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:50.646
This causes me much inconvenience.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:53.774
The 50 kilos could have been
a big problem, huh?

01:00:53.941 --> 01:00:55.692
I don't like problems.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.574
Uh...

01:01:03.534 --> 01:01:06.244
With all due respect, El Padrino...

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.580
...Diego is my partner.

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:11.249
So I won't negotiate without him.

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.919
I won't do business without him.
I just won't.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.338
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.935
Let us speak no more of this.
Let's go on a drive.

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.396
We have many other things
to talk about, yes?

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:04.511
I've made a decision.

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:07.639
We're going into business together
and I want to start right away.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:09.266
Whoo!

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:14.312
Cocaine exploded upon
the American culture like an atomic bomb.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.065
It started in Hollywood and moved east
in no time.

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:20.569
Everyone was doing it. I mean, everyone.

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.420
We invented the marketplace.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:43.508
In fact, if you snorted cocaine
in the late 1970s or early '80s...

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:46.344
...there was an 85 percent chance
it came from us.

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:48.513
All right, 3 million. I counted it twice.

01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:51.183
Two-point-five, 2.5, I'm sure.

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.351
I'm calling it 3.

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:55.979
Then we're half a million off, huh?

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:58.648
Well, fuck it. I'm not counting it again.

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:00.358
Weigh it.

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:03.487
If it's 60 pounds, it's 3 million.
Fifty is 2.5.

01:03:03.654 --> 01:03:06.031
Well, I don't give a shit.
It's close enough.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.908
Where do I put it?

01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:11.119
Try the back bedroom.

01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:14.790
No room.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.127
Try the closet.

01:03:19.837 --> 01:03:21.379
Uh...

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:23.965
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:29.721
The Colombians recommended
Noriega's bank in Panama City.

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:33.683
It was either that or launder it in the States
for a 60 percent surcharge.

01:03:33.851 --> 01:03:38.313
What? Keep only 40 percent of my money?
No, thanks.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:39.940
Congratulations, gentlemen.

01:03:40.107 --> 01:03:42.234
Even Pablo kept his money there.

01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:44.069
- I love it.
Who'd fuck with us?

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:45.695
I'm sorry.

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:48.406
I give you $30 million...

01:03:48.574 --> 01:03:50.450
...and you give me this little book.

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:29.447
- I'm married.
- Yeah, I know it.

01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:32.284
- Can you believe I'm married?
- You're a very lucky man.

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:33.785
- I love you.
- I'm proud of you.

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:37.163
- I love you.
- I love you too, my brother. I love you too.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.979
Hello.

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:03.064
Do I know you?

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.152
I don't think so.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:08.945
No?

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:13.491
Why are you smiling?

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:15.493
I don't know.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.873
I'm George.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:23.585
I know who you are, an americano.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:27.255
Mr. Jung.
I see you've met my fiancée, Mirtha.

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.008
Yeah?

01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:33.511
Yeah. Augusto would like
to see you immediately.

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:36.765
- Augusto would like to see you.
- Okay.

01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:39.017
Okay.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.186
In a minute.

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:44.606
Okay. Excuse us a minute.

01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:46.858
Go ahead.

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:56.326
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.002
George.

01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:10.674
- Please, join us. Have a drink.
How you doing? All right, fellas?

01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:12.801
You remember Mr. George?
- Mr. George.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.011
Congratulations on your conquest
of the West Coast.

01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:16.721
Thank you. Thanks very much.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:18.682
How much bigger can we get?

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:23.311
Sky's the limit. It's accepted by actors
and musicians, everybody else will follow.

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.730
- Actors and musicians.
- Actors and musicians.

01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:27.816
- Actors and musicians.
- And musicians.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.235
- Very good. Very good.
Diego.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:33.154
We were just discussing George's
West Coast operations.

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:36.408
- Hey.
- Yeah, George's mystery man.

01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:39.452
Yes, what is this mystery man?
When do we meet him?

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.872
Well, you can't meet him.
George keeps him a secret.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.916
He's here meeting everybody...

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:47.002
...he goes to Colombia, meets Pablo...

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:50.255
...but still he keeps his secret,
even from his brother, huh?

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.424
Come on. We're all in this together.

01:06:52.591 --> 01:06:54.843
- Yes, George, there's plenty for everybody.
- No.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.344
You know, I think that...

01:06:56.595 --> 01:06:59.556
I think that El Padrino's happy
with the current situation, you know?

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.850
Don't you? Yeah.

01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:08.773
I'll be back. Excuse me.

01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:11.276
You go.

01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:54.611
Breaking up a Colombian marriage
was a serious thing.

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:56.988
A lot of people were pissed off.

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.323
Didn't matter.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:00.658
I was Escobar's guy.

01:08:00.826 --> 01:08:02.952
I was untouchable.

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.313
Mirtha became my running partner.

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:32.524
Beautiful, passionate...

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:34.442
...and as crazy as I was.

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:37.779
She could party like a man
and love like a woman.

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.448
There was only one problem.

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:44.160
I would always be a gringo
to the cartel.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:47.705
Mirtha could change all that
with two choice words:

01:08:47.872 --> 01:08:49.707
I do.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.709
So do I.

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:55.712
We had the world
by the short and curlies.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:59.216
We were young, rich and in love.

01:08:59.885 --> 01:09:01.386
Nothing could stop us.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:04.680
It was perfect.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.312
Oh, dear God.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.983
Hey.

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:19.028
Put that shit away.
You're pregnant, for chrissakes.

01:09:19.196 --> 01:09:22.240
Ah, don't be such a fucking hypocrite.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:23.533
I quit smoking, didn't I?

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:27.412
Just put it away.
My fucking parents are here. Come on.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:31.582
Oh, my...

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:36.462
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Oh, God, it's enormous.

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:38.298
You like it?

01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:39.756
Just look...

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.136
Look at this credenza.

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:48.265
Oh, yes. What, it's Spanish?

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.185
If you don't mind,
how much is one of these?

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.770
- It's gotta cost a fortune.
It's a family heirloom.

01:09:52.938 --> 01:09:54.272
I've seen these in magazines.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.400
- They don't come cheap.
- Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:59.319
- Oh.
Pappy, do you like it?

01:09:59.486 --> 01:10:00.695
- Very nice.
- Nice.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.614
Come, I'll show you the rest of the house.

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:05.700
Oh, great.
George mentioned a Jacuzzi.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:08.995
I've always wanted a Jacuzzi.
Oh, and one of those bidets.

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:10.747
Cocktail?

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:12.916
Yeah. Business has been pretty good.

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:16.294
I got this little import-export thing
going down in Miami.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.504
And that's been very profitable for me.

01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:20.215
I got my investments. I got, uh...

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.759
Don't bullshit me, George.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:26.429
I don't wanna waste the time.
I don't see you that much.

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:31.476
You come from my body, remember?
You're my baby boy.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:36.147
Same kid who would jump off a mountain
if someone told him he couldn't do it.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:40.235
You haven't changed that much, heh,
have you?

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:42.487
Wow.

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:50.954
I know what you're up to.

01:10:51.705 --> 01:10:54.791
Not everything, but I get the picture.

01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:57.877
And I don't care.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.796
I don't like it.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:02.840
It's not what I would've chosen for you.

01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:06.177
But it's your life.

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:09.180
It's got nothing to do with me.

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:14.560
I couldn't stop you if I wanted to,
could I?

01:11:15.187 --> 01:11:17.021
- Probably not.
- No.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.317
It's good.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.945
Got a family.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.447
It's good if it makes you happy.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.618
It's nice to have nice things, George.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:32.704
Phew.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.206
Are you happy?

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:38.835
Yeah.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.421
Yeah, at the moment, I am happy, Dad.

01:11:48.762 --> 01:11:50.513
Three years?

01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:53.891
How long have we been in business?
Three years?

01:11:54.059 --> 01:11:56.477
Does she get to meet your connection?
Was she good enough?

01:11:57.688 --> 01:11:58.855
Shut up, Diego.

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:01.524
Gonna be here any minute.
I'm trying to concentrate.

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:04.277
Okay? I'm very angry with you, George.
Very angry.

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:07.989
You don't take me to California,
but you take your bitch wife? A woman?

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.575
It was you and me who started this.
Hey, you and me.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.995
What do you need my connection for?
What are you gonna do with it?

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:16.122
Nothing.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.249
It's for the principle.
It's for peace of mind.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:20.918
Jesus fucking Christ.
I ain't telling you, it's just business.

01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:25.089
- Now shut up. You're driving me crazy.
- I'm driving you fucking crazy?

01:12:25.799 --> 01:12:27.425
You're driving me fucking crazy.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.595
We had a dream.
What happened to our dream?

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:31.763
- Go inside.
- Shit.

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:33.264
Go on.

01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:41.439
I give you everything.
I give you everybody.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:43.566
And what do you give me, George, hmm?

01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:45.318
What do you give me?

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.738
No, no, amigo.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:53.159
Right?

01:12:56.997 --> 01:12:58.664
No problem.
We'll count the shit later.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:04.045
You embarrassed me, George.
You made me look very bad.

01:13:05.589 --> 01:13:07.131
Nothing.

01:13:07.299 --> 01:13:10.468
No, everything is not right.
I bring you in and you slap my fucking face.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.512
This is not the fucking time, Diego.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:15.473
No, no, no.

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.810
No, listen.

01:13:18.977 --> 01:13:20.978
Okay, you take the keys.
You take them and go.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:26.776
Whoa!

01:13:32.032 --> 01:13:38.913
Oh, fuck.

01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:43.418
Okay?

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:45.962
Everything's all right.
There's no problem.

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.965
Okay? Never happened.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.467
Nobody has to know anything about this.

01:13:51.635 --> 01:13:55.513
Diego, I want you to very calmly tell
these nice gentlemen...

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.683
...where the fucking cocaine is, all right?
Do it now.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:04.188
Okay?

01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:08.192
Nice doing business with you gentlemen.
Goodbye.

01:14:15.325 --> 01:14:17.243
Derek Foreal.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.037
What?

01:14:20.205 --> 01:14:23.541
Derek Foreal.
Derek fucking Foreal, all right?

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:25.877
Answer to all your fucking dreams.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:28.546
Happy now?

01:14:38.348 --> 01:14:39.807
Derek?

01:14:40.767 --> 01:14:43.561
Derek Foreal, Diego Delgado.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.207
Good to see you. Thank you.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:13.925
- Hey.
- Hello.

01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:17.845
I'm so happy to see you, to look at you.
You're beautiful. You're about to burst.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.180
I am.

01:15:23.393 --> 01:15:25.728
Tell her not to drink too much, please.

01:15:26.563 --> 01:15:28.439
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Me too.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:30.274
- We've a lot to talk about.
- Where's Diego?

01:15:30.442 --> 01:15:31.859
He's not here.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:34.904
Where is he?
And who the fuck is this Norman Cay guy?

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:38.199
Everybody's talking about Norman Cay.
Norman Cay this, Norman Cay that.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:39.784
You know him?

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.286
He's not a person.

01:15:42.454 --> 01:15:44.914
Norman's Cay is an island.

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.123
In the Bahamas.

01:15:46.291 --> 01:15:50.336
From what they say, it's very peaceful
and that's where Diego has his new home.

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:53.381
As I understand it,
he's bought 160 acres.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.467
A hotel, a marina and an airstrip.

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:59.845
He's doing multiple runs right now
using the island as a jump-off point.

01:16:00.013 --> 01:16:01.931
- What?
- Yes.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.809
And Jack Stevens
is already a very busy man.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:07.228
Along with many others.

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:11.857
No shit.

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:25.413
Hello?

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.998
Hello, Derek.

01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:28.416
George.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.501
Hey, am I wearing lipstick?

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:32.503
I said, am I wearing lipstick?

01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:34.755
When I'm getting fucked,
I wanna make sure my face...

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:37.008
Hey, look, I don't wanna be
in the middle of this.

01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:39.176
That's between you and Diego.

01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:42.138
- I bring you into this... Hang on.
- Happy New Year.

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:45.057
Happy New Year, honey.
I bring you in, this is how you pay back?

01:16:45.225 --> 01:16:49.353
Hey, look, George,
it's nothing personal. I love you.

01:16:49.521 --> 01:16:50.855
This is business.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:53.566
I gotta go, George.
- Derek.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:55.359
Derek.

01:16:57.904 --> 01:16:59.488
What's wrong?

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:04.035
- What?
- Nothing.

01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:05.870
Happy New Year.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:27.850
Welcome, my friend.

01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:30.519
- It's been a long time.
- Don't touch me.

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.194
Hey.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:41.405
Happy to see you, George. My brother.

01:17:41.573 --> 01:17:43.366
No more brothers, Diego.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.621
Why do you say that? Huh?

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:51.248
You heard me, George.
Of course we are brothers.

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:54.085
You fucked me.

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:56.629
I did not.

01:17:57.714 --> 01:17:59.507
Yeah, you did.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.842
You went behind my back.
You cut me out. You fucked me.

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.594
Me? No.

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:06.931
Never, George.

01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:08.766
Never.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:10.184
Mm-mm.

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:14.689
I talked to Derek.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:25.991
Well...

01:18:27.452 --> 01:18:29.036
...maybe you're right.

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:32.581
Maybe I did betray you...

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:34.709
...a little bit.

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:42.717
Yeah.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.554
Yeah, I stole your California connection.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:49.515
So what? Hmm?

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:53.352
Who introduced you
to Pablo Escobar, huh?

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.980
Me. Me.

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:59.650
Who introduced you
to your fucking Colombian wife, hmm?

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:02.403
Me. Who protect you...

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:07.199
...when my friend, Cesar Rosa,
wanted to slice your fucking throat out?

01:19:07.367 --> 01:19:09.493
Huh? Me.

01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:13.831
Who made you make millions
and millions of dollars?

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:14.999
Me.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:18.461
And what do I get in return?

01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:20.629
This.

01:19:21.673 --> 01:19:23.758
Accusations.

01:19:26.386 --> 01:19:28.846
I have always given you
everything, George.

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:30.514
Always.

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.349
But...

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:38.939
...that is over now.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.151
Yeah.

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:44.528
You know, this is my operation,
my dream.

01:19:44.696 --> 01:19:45.780
So go home.

01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:49.325
Go back home.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:52.036
Go home. Go back
to your stupid little life.

01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:54.663
Go back and sell half grams
to your fucking relatives...

01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:56.874
...for all I care because you're out...

01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:00.211
Because you're out.

01:20:00.378 --> 01:20:02.129
And don't be so emotional, George.

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:03.589
We're brothers.

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:05.549
We are brothers.

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.891
Next time it's fucking loaded.

01:20:17.562 --> 01:20:23.818
Bye. Bye. Bye.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.195
Bye.

01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:34.537
Say hello to your pretty wife for me.

01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:35.913
Sure.

01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:40.269
Hello.

01:21:45.108 --> 01:21:46.400
Jesus Christ.

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:48.360
It's all right, honey.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:50.946
Look at you.

01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:52.323
It's okay.

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:54.491
It's okay, baby.

01:21:54.659 --> 01:21:56.368
It's over.

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.163
I quit the business. I'm out.

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:02.708
It's all over.

01:22:03.835 --> 01:22:05.920
And I'm not going back.

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:10.049
It's just you and me...

01:22:10.216 --> 01:22:12.009
...and the baby.

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:15.596
And there's nothing else. There's just us.

01:22:17.557 --> 01:22:18.974
You know...

01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:22.144
...fuck it.

01:22:24.522 --> 01:22:32.404
Fuck them.

01:22:33.573 --> 01:22:38.953
Come here.

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:40.829
I did.

01:22:40.997 --> 01:22:42.706
I quit the business.

01:22:42.874 --> 01:22:44.750
Got out completely.

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:47.044
I mean, what the fuck? Why not?

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:51.799
I'd made $60 million
and I was out clean.

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:56.387
Well, maybe I jumped the gun on "clean."

01:22:56.554 --> 01:22:59.390
Georgie, let's go. The baby's coming.
Right, right, right.

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:02.851
I'm coming, I'm fucking coming.
Jesus Christ.

01:23:03.019 --> 01:23:05.396
George, hurry up.

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:11.694
Georgie, let's go.

01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:14.738
Right. Right. Right. What the fuck?

01:23:14.906 --> 01:23:16.532
George! George!

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:17.866
George!
George!

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:20.577
George.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.001
I'll be right down.

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:39.638
Watching my baby girl being born
did something to me.

01:23:39.806 --> 01:23:40.848
Motherfucker!

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.183
They talk about religious experiences.

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:45.102
I didn't believe in religion.

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:47.563
Hell, I didn't even particularly like kids.

01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:52.568
But when Kristina Sunshine Jung came
into this world, something in me changed.

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:55.446
I knew what I was put on the planet for.

01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:57.948
It was the greatest feeling I ever had.

01:23:58.992 --> 01:24:03.162
Followed very abruptly
by the worst feeling I ever had.

01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:04.663
George!

01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:08.459
Call the cardiologist.
I think he's having a heart attack.

01:24:08.626 --> 01:24:10.169
George!

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:18.552
The official toxicity limit for humans...

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.598
...is between 1 and 1 and a half grams
of cocaine, depending on body weight.

01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:26.351
I was averaging 5 grams a day.
Maybe more.

01:24:26.519 --> 01:24:29.313
I snorted 10 grams in 10 minutes once.

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:31.273
I guess I had a high tolerance.

01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:34.568
George, look, I'm not here
to give you lectures.

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:37.946
I have no moral interest in what you do
or don't do.

01:24:38.114 --> 01:24:40.532
But take it easy, George.

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:42.785
Stay with us a while.

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:45.204
You have a daughter now.

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:52.002
A daughter.

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:15.567
I came home and cleaned up my act.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.027
I didn't do anything.

01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:19.113
No drink, no nothing.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.948
Sober as a judge.

01:25:21.741 --> 01:25:24.201
My life was all about Kristina.

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.121
Being with her, taking care of her.

01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:29.498
I wanted to be a father.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:33.001
A good father,
just like my old man was to me.

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:13.667
After five years of laying low...

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.169
...still sober...

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:17.838
...Mirtha needed to have some fun.
- Guys, excuse me.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.673
So on my 38th birthday...

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:23.468
...she threw a little party
and invited some old friends.

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:27.389
Happy birthday, George.

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:30.392
Mirtha invited me.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.436
Yeah, she told me.

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:36.773
Look, I'm sorry about everything.

01:26:37.317 --> 01:26:40.277
You were right. I did fuck you.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.654
And Diego fucked me.

01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:44.323
Cut me out too.

01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:46.283
Well, yeah, I heard about it.

01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:49.369
I lost sight of everything, George.

01:26:50.121 --> 01:26:51.914
Forgot who my friends were.

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:56.251
Well, fuck it.

01:26:56.419 --> 01:26:58.128
It's in the past.

01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:00.297
Just forget about it.
I'm out of the business...

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:02.758
...so we'll just move on, eh?

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:04.468
Yeah.

01:27:05.136 --> 01:27:06.803
Good to see you, Derek.

01:27:06.971 --> 01:27:08.513
You too.

01:27:10.808 --> 01:27:12.392
Let's get a drink.

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:14.311
Who's cutting your hair?

01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:17.981
Let's fucking party, motherfucker.

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:20.651
Let's have some fucking fun!

01:27:21.152 --> 01:27:23.320
- Jesus, is that Mirtha?
- Yeah.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:27.157
Christ almighty, George.
What does she weigh, 80 pounds?

01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:30.869
Yeah, give or take. Come on.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:40.420
Okay.

01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:59.523
Freeze!

01:27:59.732 --> 01:28:01.275
Waiters.

01:28:02.193 --> 01:28:03.235
So it's George, is it?

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:07.239
I'm the only guy on the planet
gets busted by fucking waiters.

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:11.994
Why the feds decided to bust me
on that particular night, I'll never know.

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:15.664
Maybe it was the Porsches
and the Maseratis in the driveway...

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:18.709
...my Colombian guest list
or the cocaine buffet.

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:23.130
Whatever it was, they were just waiting
for me to slip up.

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:26.174
And I did.

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:09.718
What's this?

01:29:09.886 --> 01:29:12.387
This is your statement.
How it was all yours.

01:29:12.555 --> 01:29:14.431
The pound of cocaine
was for personal use.

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:16.767
None of the other guests
had any idea it was there.

01:29:16.934 --> 01:29:18.477
Yeah, right.

01:29:23.316 --> 01:29:27.611
I want my kid out of protective custody.
Now. No fucking around.

01:29:28.446 --> 01:29:31.448
My wife and my daughter
on a plane tonight.

01:29:32.408 --> 01:29:34.910
I sign this shit when I know
they're safe and sound.

01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:36.787
- No fucking way.
- Well, fuck you.

01:29:36.954 --> 01:29:38.914
I sign nothing, then.

01:29:44.587 --> 01:29:45.962
Do it.

01:29:48.257 --> 01:29:51.176
- Oh, you know what, one more thing.
Yeah, what?

01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:52.886
Get me a six-pack.

01:29:53.679 --> 01:29:55.263
Yeah, right.

01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:03.980
There was no way in the world
I was going back to prison.

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:09.152
So I signed the deal, took the rap
and posted bail.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.490
Once again, I would become
a fugitive on the run.

01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:20.080
Hi, Dad.

01:30:20.456 --> 01:30:22.249
Hello, George.

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:28.505
Ermine, your son is here.

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:30.465
Tell him I don't wanna see him.

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:34.136
- Tell him he's not welcome here.
- Mom...

01:30:34.303 --> 01:30:36.805
Don't you dare step foot in this house.

01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:39.433
You're not my son, you hear me?

01:30:40.226 --> 01:30:42.644
I don't have a son anymore.

01:30:47.358 --> 01:30:49.609
She's angry, George.

01:30:49.819 --> 01:30:52.154
It's been all over the news.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.450
Yeah.

01:30:57.326 --> 01:30:59.786
I just wanted let you guys know...

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:03.039
...that, uh, I'm gonna be going away
for a little while.

01:31:06.043 --> 01:31:07.961
You're not gonna go to trial?

01:31:08.546 --> 01:31:09.921
No.

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.596
Okay.

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:30.609
So this is it.

01:31:32.904 --> 01:31:34.821
I hope not, Pop.

01:31:37.408 --> 01:31:38.909
Me too.

01:31:50.379 --> 01:31:51.755
Okay.

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.676
- I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you.
- Yeah.

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:59.221
- You take care of yourself, George.
- You too.

01:32:20.117 --> 01:32:21.117
Señor Jung?
- Yeah.

01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:23.161
I wish to present Señor Rodriguez.

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:25.539
He's the president of our bank.

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:26.748
Hi.

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:33.296
I am afraid that there is a problem,
Mr. Jung.

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:35.507
The banks have gone through a change.

01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:37.884
Nationalization.

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:43.473
I am afraid that, uh,
your funds have been appropriated...

01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:46.142
...by the Panamanian government.

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:49.479
Please forgive me.

01:32:49.647 --> 01:32:53.108
Someone should have called you
from the bank earlier.

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:56.194
My apologies, please.

01:32:59.865 --> 01:33:01.825
What are we going to do?

01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:05.912
- What are we going to use for money?
Mirtha, please.

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.623
I will talk to Augusto tonight.
I'll start working for him.

01:33:08.791 --> 01:33:11.501
Just tell me!
Just answer the fucking question!

01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:14.170
What do we spend? What?

01:33:14.338 --> 01:33:16.047
How will we live?

01:33:16.215 --> 01:33:18.133
Not in front of the kid.

01:33:18.301 --> 01:33:20.260
Don't give me that shit.

01:33:20.886 --> 01:33:22.178
Just better do something.

01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:40.530
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
Don't be upset.

01:33:41.824 --> 01:33:43.992
What's happening to us?

01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:48.204
I don't know.

01:33:49.248 --> 01:33:51.374
Are we gonna get split up?

01:33:51.542 --> 01:33:54.419
No, Jesus. God, don't even say that.

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:58.548
Listen to me. I love your mother.

01:33:59.425 --> 01:34:01.551
But she's upset right now.

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:06.723
And you're my heart, kid.

01:34:08.517 --> 01:34:10.602
Now, could I live without my heart?

01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:13.396
I hope not.

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:19.903
Take it easy. There's a cop back there,
all right? Right behind us.

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.072
Just fucking drive.

01:34:22.406 --> 01:34:24.074
What is your fucking problem?

01:34:26.744 --> 01:34:29.871
We are broke. That's my fucking problem.

01:34:30.039 --> 01:34:32.582
- And you are a fucking spy.
- What?

01:34:35.086 --> 01:34:36.252
That's right.

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:39.255
- Always spying, always judging.
- Right.

01:34:39.423 --> 01:34:42.342
Everyone's laughing at you in your face,
you fucking pussy.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:43.718
Thanks.

01:34:43.886 --> 01:34:45.595
You let Diego fuck you in the ass.

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:48.181
- Right.
- Maybe because you like it.

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:50.684
- Maybe because you are a fucking faggot.
- Right.

01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:52.644
That's what I think you are.

01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:55.271
I think you're fucking him
because you're not fucking me.

01:34:55.439 --> 01:34:57.774
You gotta be fucking somebody else.

01:34:58.818 --> 01:35:00.527
- Why's that?
- Come on. Take it easy.

01:35:00.695 --> 01:35:03.613
- Why don't you fuck me anymore?
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

01:35:03.781 --> 01:35:07.575
- Why? Why don't you fuck me anymore?
- Get over there. Mirtha.

01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:20.630
Don't you ever put your hands on me,
motherfucker!

01:35:20.798 --> 01:35:22.632
Don't you ever touch me again!

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.467
- Asshole!
- Relax!

01:35:24.635 --> 01:35:27.095
Get your hands off me!

01:35:27.638 --> 01:35:30.640
He's a fugitive
and a fucking cocaine dealer!

01:35:30.808 --> 01:35:33.977
He has a kilo in his trunk right now!

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:35.437
Look. Let me see that...

01:35:35.604 --> 01:35:38.982
Take this sorry motherfucker to jail.

01:36:19.482 --> 01:36:21.649
I'm divorcing you, George.

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:25.153
And I'm getting custody of Kristina.

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:30.492
And when you get out next week,
you're gonna pay support.

01:36:30.659 --> 01:36:32.368
And that's the end of it.

01:36:32.745 --> 01:36:34.078
Okay?

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:38.166
There is someone else.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.961
I don't think you care...

01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:45.298
...but I wanted to tell you.

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:50.303
Say something.

01:36:51.722 --> 01:36:53.723
What do you want me to say?

01:36:54.934 --> 01:36:56.726
I'm in prison.

01:36:58.395 --> 01:37:02.357
- You should know, you put me in here.
- I knew you'd say something like that.

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:07.612
Always thinking about yourself.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.792
Say hello to your father.
- My God.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.502
Say hello to your father.
- No.

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:24.087
Go now. Say hello.

01:37:31.762 --> 01:37:33.471
Hello, sweetheart.

01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:37.892
I thought you couldn't live
without your heart.

01:38:10.175 --> 01:38:12.802
Every single day in the joint...

01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:14.888
...I thought of one thing...

01:38:15.055 --> 01:38:17.140
...one thing only:

01:38:17.766 --> 01:38:19.726
My baby girl.

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.563
I needed to get my heart back.

01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:47.503
Hi, honey.

01:38:47.671 --> 01:38:49.547
What are you doing here?

01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:55.345
Well, I just wanted to let you know
that I was out and I wanted to see you.

01:38:57.222 --> 01:38:58.431
How you doing?

01:38:58.974 --> 01:39:02.060
George, you just can't show
up like this.

01:39:02.728 --> 01:39:04.938
Why don't you try calling me Dad?

01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:06.773
I don't want to, all right?

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:11.235
- Now leave me alone.
- Wait, honey. Listen, Kristina.

01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:14.155
I'm sorry.

01:39:15.157 --> 01:39:17.575
I wanna make everything okay.

01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:19.202
You know?

01:39:20.412 --> 01:39:22.914
What do you want from me, huh?

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.710
I wanna be your dad again.

01:39:28.837 --> 01:39:31.506
I just wanna walk with you,
if you don't mind.

01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:36.302
I wanna make everything okay.

01:39:36.762 --> 01:39:38.763
Please, Kristina.

01:39:39.181 --> 01:39:43.184
If you could go anywhere in the world,
anywhere...

01:39:44.061 --> 01:39:47.105
...where would you wanna go?
I was making headway.

01:39:47.272 --> 01:39:51.067
Kristina and I walked
to and from school every day.

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:53.903
- Things were starting to look up.
- Maybe California?

01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:57.490
California?
Well, you can go anywhere in the world.

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:02.412
You can go to India, Tibet.
Uh, Israel, France, whatever.

01:40:02.621 --> 01:40:04.831
- You'd still choose California?
- Yeah.

01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:06.416
Yeah?

01:40:06.875 --> 01:40:08.626
Hey, Mom.

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:12.588
All right. Well, look, go on inside.

01:40:12.756 --> 01:40:14.215
Okay.

01:40:17.094 --> 01:40:20.346
- Bye, Dad. See you in the morning.
- Okay, I'll be here.

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:24.350
- Hey, Mom.
Hi.

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:26.728
I'm gonna go inside
and do my homework.

01:40:26.895 --> 01:40:29.188
Okay, honey. I'll be there in a minute.

01:40:36.238 --> 01:40:37.905
What do you want?

01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:40.783
Truce.

01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:44.037
I don't wanna fight with you anymore,
Mirtha.

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:46.831
I just wanna get along with you,
you know?

01:40:47.791 --> 01:40:49.459
Be civil.

01:40:52.838 --> 01:40:54.964
You know I've been seeing Kristina,
right?

01:40:55.132 --> 01:40:56.966
Yeah, she told me.

01:40:57.509 --> 01:40:59.510
You walk her to school.

01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:01.262
Yeah.

01:41:03.557 --> 01:41:07.060
Anyway, I've been thinking, uh...

01:41:08.854 --> 01:41:11.439
I love her. You know that.

01:41:12.316 --> 01:41:16.652
I was thinking I'd kind of like to have her.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.199
I've been away for such a long time,
you know, I just...

01:41:22.993 --> 01:41:24.911
I just wanna be with her.

01:41:27.081 --> 01:41:29.707
I haven't seen one dollar from you.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.667
You haven't paid me one cent.

01:41:34.296 --> 01:41:37.256
Child support, alimony.

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:42.011
You start helping us...

01:41:42.387 --> 01:41:44.555
...we'll see what will happen.

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:51.020
All right. That's it.

01:41:51.355 --> 01:41:53.272
That's all I wanted to say.

01:41:55.734 --> 01:41:56.859
Take care, yeah?

01:41:57.027 --> 01:41:58.653
You too.

01:42:04.118 --> 01:42:05.785
George.

01:42:11.917 --> 01:42:13.459
Are you okay?

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:17.964
Yeah.

01:42:20.342 --> 01:42:22.218
Hello? Derek.

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:23.719
Hey, George.

01:42:25.264 --> 01:42:26.681
Lookit.

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:29.684
I need to do something.
I wanna put together a crew, huh?

01:42:29.852 --> 01:42:31.477
Know anybody?

01:42:33.272 --> 01:42:34.856
It's a four-man operation.

01:42:35.023 --> 01:42:37.233
Two on the ground, two in the air.

01:42:37.401 --> 01:42:39.110
Who's the copilot?

01:42:40.195 --> 01:42:42.029
You're looking at him.

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:44.991
We'll provide the plane,
transportation costs...

01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:47.827
...U.S. Landing spot, and we'll take it
wherever you want it to go.

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:49.871
You provide a pickup point
in South America...

01:42:50.038 --> 01:42:51.914
...and you're responsible for payment.

01:42:52.082 --> 01:42:54.709
You also assume all bust risk.

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:58.296
After that, we take 65 percent
of all transportation fees...

01:42:58.463 --> 01:43:01.382
...10 percent of the gross,
plus our expenses.

01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:05.511
And this is not a negotiation,
so if it's okay with you, we can talk further.

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:08.014
If not, forget we had this conversation.

01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:10.224
No, no, no. Everything sounds good.

01:43:10.392 --> 01:43:13.769
Um, I'm gonna need to meet
everybody involved, though.

01:43:15.939 --> 01:43:17.732
Right there at the table.

01:43:18.942 --> 01:43:19.942
Come on.

01:43:20.611 --> 01:43:22.695
Gentlemen, this is George.

01:43:23.322 --> 01:43:24.530
- George.
What do you say?

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:25.948
- Georgie.
My God, Dulli.

01:43:26.116 --> 01:43:27.116
- Oh, my God.
Dulli.

01:43:27.284 --> 01:43:30.453
- Jesus. It's been 14 years, man.
- Oh, man, George.

01:43:30.913 --> 01:43:32.246
- You look great.
- Yeah, so do you.

01:43:32.414 --> 01:43:34.665
Hey, this is my friend.
I've known this guy for 30 years.

01:43:34.833 --> 01:43:37.043
- Ben.
- How do you do?

01:43:37.211 --> 01:43:39.420
- Have my seat.
- Nice to see you.

01:43:39.963 --> 01:43:41.797
Heard you got married.

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:44.884
Hey, honey, you know what?

01:43:45.052 --> 01:43:46.469
What?

01:43:47.638 --> 01:43:50.056
I was thinking about getting
out of town this week.

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:52.016
And where are you going?

01:43:52.184 --> 01:43:53.476
I don't know.

01:43:53.644 --> 01:43:56.229
- Maybe California.
- Liar.

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:57.563
Yeah.

01:43:57.731 --> 01:44:00.441
Go out there, check it out,
see what it's like.

01:44:00.609 --> 01:44:02.777
I got a few things
I have to take care of first...

01:44:02.945 --> 01:44:05.988
...but I was thinking maybe Thursday.
You know, Thursday after school.

01:44:06.156 --> 01:44:09.033
You know I can't.
Mom will never let me go.

01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:10.743
You let me take care of your mother.

01:44:11.161 --> 01:44:12.954
You just pack your bags, okay?

01:44:13.121 --> 01:44:14.622
But I've got school.

01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:18.751
I know. But a friend of mine told me
that they got schools in California too.

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:21.337
- You swear?
- Yeah.

01:44:21.588 --> 01:44:24.840
Three o'clock, Thursday,
at your mother's. You and me, huh?

01:44:25.008 --> 01:44:27.677
- It's a date.
- I don't believe you.

01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:33.474
I swear on my life, Scout's honor.

01:44:34.268 --> 01:44:36.185
Swear on my life.

01:44:41.191 --> 01:44:42.984
I swear on your life.

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.385
All right.

01:45:11.513 --> 01:45:13.889
That's a nice boy.

01:45:14.224 --> 01:45:16.142
Go on, get him, Dulli.

01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:19.228
Get in.

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:29.113
- Oh, yeah.
- Are we good?

01:45:29.448 --> 01:45:33.743
Are we good? Yeah, we're good.
We're fucking beautiful.

01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:35.161
We're perfect.

01:45:35.329 --> 01:45:39.790
This is Grade A, 100-percent pure
Colombian cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

01:45:39.958 --> 01:45:41.500
Disco shit.

01:45:41.668 --> 01:45:43.586
- Pure as the driven snow.
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:43.754 --> 01:45:46.547
- Right.
- Good fucking riddance.

01:45:47.132 --> 01:45:48.215
- Dulli.
- Yeah.

01:45:48.383 --> 01:45:50.092
- You saved my fucking life.
- No, I didn't.

01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:52.303
No shit. You'll never know. Really.

01:45:52.471 --> 01:45:53.512
All you guys.

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:55.222
Really.

01:45:55.849 --> 01:45:58.601
And being as how I'm feeling
so fucking generous tonight...

01:45:59.686 --> 01:46:01.354
...you just got a raise.

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:04.398
A raise?
- Yeah.

01:46:04.566 --> 01:46:07.568
Instead of 10 percent,
you're gonna get 15.

01:46:08.278 --> 01:46:09.612
Jesus, George.

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:12.239
Fifteen percent?
That's an extra 200 grand.

01:46:12.657 --> 01:46:14.450
That's right. Fuck it.

01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:17.453
Do whatever want with it.
Have a nice life. I'm out.

01:46:18.955 --> 01:46:20.414
Last fucking party.

01:46:21.083 --> 01:46:22.958
I'm gonna go out to California.

01:46:23.126 --> 01:46:25.461
Start a new life with my kid.

01:46:25.712 --> 01:46:27.296
Here's to it.

01:46:27.714 --> 01:46:29.924
Cheers.
- Here's to you, Georgie.

01:46:30.092 --> 01:46:31.592
Cheers.

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.344
- Here's to you, George.
Cheers.

01:46:33.512 --> 01:46:35.137
All right, fellas.

01:46:36.681 --> 01:46:37.723
- Dulli?
- Yeah.

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:39.850
How about another round?
I'm gonna hit the head.

01:46:40.018 --> 01:46:41.352
Okay.

01:46:42.771 --> 01:46:45.564
I feel like a fucking kid today.

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:01.163
What?

01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:03.499
I feel bad.

01:47:04.167 --> 01:47:05.668
Me too.

01:47:07.045 --> 01:47:08.879
I like him too, but what's done is done.

01:47:09.047 --> 01:47:11.424
So let's not get all sentimental about it,
all right?

01:47:21.435 --> 01:47:23.686
Hey, Dulli, you know
what I was thinking?

01:47:23.854 --> 01:47:26.772
I was... I was remembering that, uh...
That time we flew in to Mexico.

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.649
You remember that fucking landing strip?

01:47:28.817 --> 01:47:30.693
- Right?
- Hmm, yeah.

01:47:30.861 --> 01:47:32.736
Fucking nuts.

01:47:33.822 --> 01:47:35.865
You're much better now.

01:47:43.206 --> 01:47:44.707
What's going on?

01:47:45.667 --> 01:47:49.253
What the fuck? What's, uh...?
What's with the long faces?

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:52.298
Huh?

01:47:56.219 --> 01:47:58.554
Where's my fucking knife?

01:48:20.577 --> 01:48:22.036
No.

01:48:32.506 --> 01:48:34.256
Let's do it.

01:48:49.606 --> 01:48:51.565
I was busted.

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:54.693
Set up by the FBI and the DEA.

01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:56.779
That didn't bother me.

01:48:56.947 --> 01:49:00.115
Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal
to save their own asses.

01:49:00.283 --> 01:49:02.076
That didn't bother me.

01:49:02.244 --> 01:49:05.329
Sentenced to 60 years at Otisville.

01:49:05.497 --> 01:49:07.414
That didn't bother me.

01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:13.045
I'd broken a promise.

01:49:14.005 --> 01:49:17.132
Everything I love in my life goes away.

01:49:29.771 --> 01:49:31.814
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hey, Arch.

01:49:31.982 --> 01:49:33.482
What's going on?

01:49:33.692 --> 01:49:35.818
Well, ahem...

01:49:39.114 --> 01:49:40.155
You all right?

01:49:40.323 --> 01:49:41.907
I'm good.

01:49:44.327 --> 01:49:46.036
Fuck.

01:49:50.166 --> 01:49:51.542
What do you got?

01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:54.336
Bad news.

01:49:54.879 --> 01:49:58.841
Tried to get you furloughed,
but, uh, your mom squashed it.

01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:03.387
Said, uh, would only upset him.

01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:06.932
So, um, doesn't look good.

01:50:14.399 --> 01:50:16.150
How's he doing?

01:50:16.943 --> 01:50:18.569
Not good.

01:50:18.862 --> 01:50:21.530
He's out of the hospital.
He's home, but, uh...

01:50:22.449 --> 01:50:25.284
...I don't think there's anything
anyone can do for him.

01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:27.703
It's just a matter of time.

01:50:31.166 --> 01:50:32.791
Got you a tape recorder.

01:50:32.959 --> 01:50:34.418
I thought, uh...

01:50:35.253 --> 01:50:37.212
...you know,
might wanna hear your voice.

01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:39.381
If you wanna say something to him.

01:50:40.425 --> 01:50:41.884
Right.

01:50:42.052 --> 01:50:43.802
I'll give you five.

01:51:14.542 --> 01:51:16.251
Hello, Dad.

01:51:20.382 --> 01:51:22.883
You know, I remember a lifetime ago...

01:51:23.051 --> 01:51:25.678
...I was about 3 and a half feet tall...

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:30.182
...weighing all of 60 pounds,
but every inch your son.

01:51:32.227 --> 01:51:35.145
Those Saturday mornings
going to work with my dad...

01:51:35.313 --> 01:51:39.191
...and we'd climb into
that big green truck.

01:51:39.901 --> 01:51:44.571
I thought that truck was the biggest
truck in the universe, Pop.

01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:48.409
I remember how important
the job we did was.

01:51:48.576 --> 01:51:50.661
How, if it weren't for us...

01:51:50.995 --> 01:51:53.122
...people would freeze to death.

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:58.168
I thought you were the strongest man
in the world.

01:52:00.797 --> 01:52:02.589
Remember those home movies...

01:52:02.757 --> 01:52:04.591
...when Mom would dress up
like Loretta Young?

01:52:04.759 --> 01:52:07.136
Ice creams, football games.

01:52:07.303 --> 01:52:09.263
Waino, the Tuna.

01:52:09.431 --> 01:52:13.684
Day I left for California only to come
home with the FBI chasing me.

01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:16.353
That FBI agent, Trout.

01:52:16.521 --> 01:52:19.022
When he had to get on his knees
to put my boots on, you said:

01:52:19.190 --> 01:52:22.067
This is where you belong,
you son of a bitch.

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:24.528
Putting on Georgie's boots.

01:52:25.655 --> 01:52:27.656
That was a good one, Dad.

01:52:28.366 --> 01:52:30.325
That was really something.

01:52:30.827 --> 01:52:32.494
You remember that?

01:52:35.373 --> 01:52:38.333
And that time you told me
that money wasn't real?

01:52:39.836 --> 01:52:41.712
Well, old man...

01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:43.922
...I'm 42 years old...

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:48.677
...and I finally realize
what you were trying to tell me...

01:52:49.345 --> 01:52:51.805
...so many years ago.

01:52:53.016 --> 01:52:55.267
I finally understand.

01:52:59.355 --> 01:53:01.398
You're the best, Dad.

01:53:02.942 --> 01:53:05.527
I just wish I could've done more for you.

01:53:05.695 --> 01:53:07.571
Wish we had more time.

01:53:09.324 --> 01:53:10.949
Anyway...

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:17.039
...may the wind always be at your back...

01:53:17.373 --> 01:53:20.000
...and the sun always upon your face.

01:53:20.835 --> 01:53:23.587
And the winds of destiny
to carry you aloft...

01:53:23.755 --> 01:53:26.006
...to dance with the stars.

01:53:34.432 --> 01:53:36.183
I love you, Dad.

01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:39.102
Love, George.

01:54:01.084 --> 01:54:02.543
George.

01:54:03.002 --> 01:54:05.879
George, come on. You have a visitor.

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:35.284
Hello, sweetheart.

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:41.123
Hi, Daddy.

01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:46.128
God, you're so big.

01:54:52.927 --> 01:54:54.678
Daddy's a fuckup.

01:54:56.973 --> 01:54:58.473
No.

01:55:02.353 --> 01:55:03.812
Come here.

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:11.820
You're the only thing in my life
that ever meant anything.

01:55:11.988 --> 01:55:13.155
You swear?

01:55:13.323 --> 01:55:15.365
I swear, baby.

01:55:16.618 --> 01:55:18.327
I swear.

01:55:18.995 --> 01:55:21.288
I love you, Kristina.

01:55:22.624 --> 01:55:25.250
You're the only good thing in my life.

01:55:25.668 --> 01:55:28.086
You're the only thing
that ever meant anything to me.

01:55:29.839 --> 01:55:31.673
I love you.

01:55:41.517 --> 01:55:43.435
Come on. Let's go.

01:55:50.234 --> 01:55:52.611
So tell me about your life.

01:55:53.529 --> 01:55:54.947
What do you wanna know?

01:55:55.114 --> 01:55:56.949
Everything. I mean...

01:55:57.825 --> 01:55:59.993
...what do you do? You go to school?
You...?

01:56:00.161 --> 01:56:01.203
Sometimes.

01:56:01.371 --> 01:56:02.496
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:56:02.664 --> 01:56:05.457
- Just like the old man.
- Yeah.

01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:07.793
George!

01:56:07.961 --> 01:56:10.170
Let's go. It's getting dark.

01:56:11.381 --> 01:56:13.340
Come on. It's getting late.

01:56:17.095 --> 01:56:18.762
Come on, let's go.

01:56:23.309 --> 01:56:24.810
Let's go.

01:56:26.646 --> 01:56:28.480
I got a visitor.

01:56:28.690 --> 01:56:29.898
Not today, George.

01:56:30.066 --> 01:56:31.733
Time to go back.

01:56:33.403 --> 01:56:34.861
Yeah, but l...

01:56:35.029 --> 01:56:38.073
I wanna put her on the list for tomorrow.

01:56:38.241 --> 01:56:39.324
My daughter.

01:56:39.492 --> 01:56:41.159
Okay, George.

01:56:42.578 --> 01:56:44.955
She's gonna visit me.
My daughter's gonna visit me tomorrow.

01:56:45.123 --> 01:56:47.916
So in the end, was it worth it?

01:56:48.084 --> 01:56:49.251
It's lockdown time.

01:56:49.419 --> 01:56:51.586
Jesus Christ.

01:56:52.005 --> 01:56:55.215
How irreparably changed
my life has become.

01:56:55.383 --> 01:56:58.260
It's always the last day of summer
and I've been left out in the cold...

01:56:58.428 --> 01:57:00.804
...with no door to get back in.

01:57:01.597 --> 01:57:05.308
I'll grant you, I've had more
than my share of poignant moments.

01:57:05.476 --> 01:57:09.938
Life passes most people by
while they're making grand plans for it.

01:57:10.773 --> 01:57:12.607
Throughout my lifetime...

01:57:12.775 --> 01:57:15.277
...I've left pieces of my heart
here and there.

01:57:15.445 --> 01:57:18.613
And now there's almost not enough
to stay alive.

01:57:19.115 --> 01:57:20.907
But I force a smile...

01:57:21.075 --> 01:57:25.287
...knowing that my ambition
far exceeded my talent.

01:57:26.456 --> 01:57:28.707
There are no more white horses...

01:57:28.875 --> 01:57:31.460
...or pretty ladies at my door.
