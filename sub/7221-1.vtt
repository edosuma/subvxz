02:10.560 --> 02:13.081
Are these actors masochists?

02:14.760 --> 02:17.081
If I chose them, they are.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.805
Is sex about politics?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.729
There's nothing that
isn't politics.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
When your last film,
Salo, will be released,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
will you scandalize again?

03:01.760 --> 03:04.843
I think to scandalize
is a right,

03:05.040 --> 03:07.247
to be scandalized is a pleasure,

03:07.440 --> 03:10.444
and those who refuse to be
scandalized are moralists.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.801
the so called moralists.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.801
Why aren't you a
militant anymore?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.445
What do you mean?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.445
You are not a political
militant anymore.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.327
I am more than ever.

03:35.120 --> 03:39.327
Are you nostalgic of the period in which
people insulted you in the streets?

03:39.760 --> 03:41.683
They're still insulting me.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.900
Does it provoke in you
a certain pleasure?

03:46.800 --> 03:49.280
I don't deny it

03:49.480 --> 03:51.369
since I'm not a moralist.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.369
What is the profession
you prefer?

03:54.480 --> 04:01.369
Poet? Writer? Scenarist? Actor?
Critic? Director?

04:05.480 --> 04:09.369
In my passport, I simply
report: "writer".

05:32.920 --> 05:34.684
Dear Alberto

05:34.880 --> 05:37.406
I send you this

05:37.600 --> 05:39.045
so that you can give me advice.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.004
It's a novel

05:41.200 --> 05:44.044
but it's not written
like true novels are:

05:44.240 --> 05:47.767
its terminology is the
one used in essays,

05:47.960 --> 05:49.883
in some newspaper articles,

05:50.080 --> 05:50.922
in reviews,

05:51.120 --> 05:53.771
in private letters
or even in poetry.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.566
This is the advice
I ask from you:

05:57.760 --> 06:00.730
is what I've written enough,

06:00.920 --> 06:05.289
in order to decently and poetically
say what I wanted to say?

06:13.240 --> 06:16.528
I'd like you to consider,
before advising me

06:16.720 --> 06:20.202
that the protagonist of
this novel is whoever he is

06:20.400 --> 06:23.847
and, analogies between his
story and mine aside,

06:24.040 --> 06:26.486
he disgusts me.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.926
This novel is of no use
to my life anymore..

06:41.120 --> 06:46.968
It is not a proclamation. It
is the preamble to a testament

06:47.160 --> 06:52.041
the testimony of that little of
knowledge that a man has gathered,

06:52.240 --> 06:56.962
a totally different knowledge from
what he had expected it to be.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.844
or wondered.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.640
Love.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.327
Go.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.850
Good.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.411
Good. Come on..

08:07.880 --> 08:09.120
Yes...

10:00.480 --> 10:03.723
Ninni.. Pieruti

10:15.360 --> 10:16.600
Mom.

10:16.800 --> 10:21.601
You're back... We've been so
far away one from another.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.288
I'm getting up, mom.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.926
Hi Pieruti.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.531
Hi Graziella.

12:59.720 --> 13:00.801
How did the trip go?

13:01.000 --> 13:01.967
It went well, thanks.

13:15.240 --> 13:20.007
Listen Graziella... you have
to read Sciascia's last novel,

13:20.200 --> 13:22.726
you can take it from my desk

13:22.920 --> 13:25.366
it's a really important book.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.244
Thank you, I'll read it.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.931
Carlo Levi called to say hi.

13:33.120 --> 13:33.689
Yes.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.484
La Stampa's editor would
like you to call him back.

13:35.680 --> 13:36.647
Ok.

13:36.840 --> 13:40.128
Ah, I've copied your
speech for the radicals'

13:40.320 --> 13:42.084
meeting and I've put
it on your desk.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.725
That's good, thanks.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.843
Carlo was not the only
powerful individual

15:19.040 --> 15:21.202
to adapt to such
an official feast,

15:22.880 --> 15:24.848
a destination for opportunists,

15:25.040 --> 15:25.882
for snobs,

15:26.080 --> 15:27.241
for background actors,

15:27.440 --> 15:30.364
for officials and
bureaucrats with ladies.

15:30.560 --> 15:35.088
And he wasn't the only one who had
to make the best of a bad situation.

15:35.280 --> 15:39.968
At the center, unmoved mover,
was the Head of State..

15:40.160 --> 15:44.484
Even during the
democracy process

15:44.680 --> 15:47.604
the “holy game of kings” kept being
played, and the ritualistic life

15:47.800 --> 15:50.929
of royalty is still well spread
among the bourgeoisie...

15:51.120 --> 15:54.522
Meanwhile all around Carlo,

15:54.720 --> 15:57.326
who just entered,
there was pure chaos.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.966
I've been attacked by
certain journalists lately,

16:02.160 --> 16:04.481
journalists related to ENI

16:04.680 --> 16:10.323
So many disappointments. That's
why I had to do it my way.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.165
I tell you, tell the Americans

16:35.360 --> 16:38.250
that the government has no intention
whatsoever of taxing oil.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.248
Sure, sure, sure.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.804
Vincenzo Cazzaniga
is highly esteemed

16:44.000 --> 16:46.048
in the very Vatican Bank.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.969
The Agnellis get
their money back

16:48.160 --> 16:49.366
through the Vatican Bank.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.083
Sure.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.249
To us Andreotti and honesty
are the same thing.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.920
Because if he says
that those bombs in

16:58.120 --> 16:59.360
Milan are not our problem,

16:59.560 --> 17:01.642
it means that they're not.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.171
Well then, we adapt

17:03.360 --> 17:04.599
we adapt to all this.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.365
OK, that's right.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.964
Narrative, as you
well know, is dead.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.607
We're mourning it.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.530
Mine is not a tale,
but a metaphor.

17:28.280 --> 17:32.171
The meaning of this metaphor
is the relationship between

17:32.360 --> 17:34.966
an artist and what he
creates and shapes.

18:11.480 --> 18:17.010
Narrative, as you
well know, is dead.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.362
We're mourning it.

18:19.560 --> 18:26.682
Mine is not a tale,
but a metaphor.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.089
The meaning of this metaphor
is the relationship between

18:30.280 --> 18:33.921
an artist and what he
creates and shapes.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.691
Andrea Fago, or
the "eating man",

18:54.880 --> 18:59.204
took as usually the
Alitalia DC9 flight,

18:59.400 --> 19:02.244
on a calm spring afternoon,

19:02.440 --> 19:05.364
a flight ought to
land on Cape Town.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.404
- There you go.
- Thanks..

19:19.280 --> 19:20.725
What's your name, miss?

19:20.920 --> 19:21.807
Caterina.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.729
Caterina.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.366
At what time we're
done, Caterina?

19:26.560 --> 19:27.925
We land at 12.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.090
And are you going to
have lunch with someone?

19:31.280 --> 19:31.803
No.

19:32.000 --> 19:32.842
May I invite you?

19:33.040 --> 19:34.007
Why not?

19:42.920 --> 19:47.642
Those would be some hours of
quite and beautiful travel.

19:47.840 --> 19:52.323
First of all Egypt,

19:52.520 --> 19:54.409
and its Nile,

19:56.120 --> 19:58.282
and its green trees,

19:58.480 --> 20:01.689
and its palms and

20:01.880 --> 20:05.885
the cornfields, and the
dark okra villages.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.602
After that Sudan,

20:09.800 --> 20:14.169
and its never-ending
southern desert,

20:14.360 --> 20:16.044
so wonderfully pink.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.604
I would like to insist
that this desert's pink is

20:22.800 --> 20:23.961
really something:

20:24.160 --> 20:28.165
but it's even more
impressive its vastness.

20:28.360 --> 20:32.365
It never ends and never changes,

20:32.560 --> 20:37.122
from Khartoum to Rudolph Lake.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.086
what gives a feeling of
terror to this desert

20:41.280 --> 20:45.524
though is the fact that
it is not a desert,

20:45.720 --> 20:51.841
but a huge hollow country,
forgotten by both God and man.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.247
Well, this was the desert

20:54.440 --> 20:56.681
in which the Alitalia
DC9 crashed.

21:15.880 --> 21:20.442
All that I'm going to tell
you was not displayed

21:20.640 --> 21:25.601
in this world's theatre
but in my head's.

21:25.800 --> 21:29.361
It took not place in
the space of reality,

21:29.560 --> 21:32.006
but in the one of
my imagination.

21:32.200 --> 21:37.240
And eventually, it played out not
according to the contradictory rules

21:37.440 --> 21:41.490
of the game of the existence,
but it did according to the

21:41.680 --> 21:44.251
contradictory rules of
the game of my reason.

22:08.360 --> 22:12.888
Andrea Fago watched those men
who where coming towards him.

22:13.080 --> 22:16.846
Those ancient men
he knew so well.

22:17.040 --> 22:22.206
He contemplated them, no,
he recognised them silent.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.803
Then a smile,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.571
an amazing smile
stretched his lips

22:27.760 --> 22:29.967
and enlightened his eyes.

22:30.160 --> 22:33.960
That smile was enigmatic because

22:34.160 --> 22:37.403
it was so human, that
it came from the mind.

22:37.600 --> 22:43.050
the continuity between me and them,
and back between them and me,

22:43.240 --> 22:49.930
breaks: I'm a shape whose
knowledge is illusion.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.370
There's the list of the
interviews for Salim.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.123
About the movie release,

23:44.320 --> 23:46.368
Mr Agnelli wants to release
it in Milan first.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.449
He believes that we
will have better odds

23:48.640 --> 23:50.324
with the censorship.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.603
Let's hope he's right.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.280
Some optimism...
Would you like this?

23:56.480 --> 23:57.561
Let me try it.

23:59.640 --> 24:03.042
Aunt Susanna, this was
sent me by Gaetano

24:03.240 --> 24:05.447
Perusini, only for Pier Paolo.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.642
Ah, from Rocca Bernarda.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.683
Is there.. Furio Colombo too?

24:09.880 --> 24:11.530
Yes. It's for la Stampa,

24:11.720 --> 24:14.087
for their new literary section.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.691
But they want to make
it as soon as they can.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.486
Ask him if he can come
by this afternoon.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.367
Now, Graziella,

24:25.560 --> 24:26.846
where have you been
these last days?

24:27.040 --> 24:29.281
We've been to the pinewood
in Castel Fusano.

24:29.480 --> 24:32.131
A beautiful place. Full
of beautiful flowers.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.562
And what about you? E'
piaciuta Stoccolma Pieruti?

24:36.760 --> 24:39.445
Yes mommy, but I think
we would never be able

24:39.640 --> 24:41.847
to live there, you and I...

24:44.000 --> 24:46.367
And what do you think
about Montale's Nobel?

24:46.560 --> 24:50.724
I said at Stockholm that

24:50.920 --> 24:53.127
they should have given it to
Sandro Penna, and not to Montale.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.608
By the way how's Sandro doing?

24:56.800 --> 24:58.882
Did you see him lately?

24:59.080 --> 25:02.323
Sandro is poor and sick...

25:02.520 --> 25:05.603
now he's complaining since he
isn't able to chew anymore.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.371
I don't get why he doesn't
want to use a denture...

25:08.560 --> 25:12.360
now he has this bad habit of calling
on the phone here at night..

25:12.560 --> 25:14.642
And he talks, and
talks, and talks..

25:14.840 --> 25:17.650
Last time, aunt
Susanna put the phone

25:17.840 --> 25:19.842
on the table and she went
back watching the TV...

25:20.800 --> 25:25.249
You should write down
everything he says, instead.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.521
He is a great poet.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.641
It's Laura.

25:37.720 --> 25:38.926
Here she is...

25:48.280 --> 25:50.328
- Hi, Graziella!
- Hello Laura.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.005
How do you do?

25:54.200 --> 25:55.122
Very well. What about you?

25:55.320 --> 25:56.162
Welcome back Laura.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.122
Handsome.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.370
Good morning!

26:03.560 --> 26:04.561
Hello.

26:04.760 --> 26:06.091
Susanna...

26:06.360 --> 26:07.282
How's it going?

26:07.480 --> 26:08.242
Well, well.

26:08.440 --> 26:09.646
What about you?

26:09.840 --> 26:11.683
Get me a chair.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.245
How was your travelling?

26:16.440 --> 26:18.408
Fine, fine. What about yours?

26:18.600 --> 26:20.602
Zagabria... your Jancso pal

26:20.800 --> 26:23.371
tortured us for the whole movie

26:23.560 --> 26:26.040
we shot without a break

26:26.240 --> 26:29.050
these last two days,
all day and all night.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.049
It was madness, mom.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.687
And did you manage to
give him what he wanted?

26:34.880 --> 26:36.530
Of course.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.643
In the beginning he tried to

26:38.840 --> 26:39.568
stop me from improvising

26:39.760 --> 26:43.367
but in the end... I've helped him
shooting the orgy sequences...

26:43.560 --> 26:46.450
Ah socialist actresses

26:46.640 --> 26:48.085
such a wonder, eh...

26:48.280 --> 26:51.204
I adore them, they're
real professionals!

26:51.400 --> 26:53.482
They put this hemorrhoids cream

26:53.680 --> 26:55.364
on their pussies to
hide the wrinkles..

26:56.640 --> 26:58.210
I'll start putting it too.

26:58.400 --> 27:01.961
But here... on the
eye wrinkles, look!

27:02.160 --> 27:04.686
Since I don't have the money for

27:04.880 --> 27:08.123
expensive creams... Oh, so good!

27:08.320 --> 27:09.287
Are you hungry?

27:09.480 --> 27:13.804
No, but you can't imagine how much I
missed the Italian food in Jugoslavia,

27:14.000 --> 27:17.129
because there the food is awful

27:17.320 --> 27:20.369
I don't know why communism and
fine cuisine are always apart...

27:20.560 --> 27:26.567
Ah, I brought you something that...
well...

27:26.760 --> 27:28.000
I hope you like.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.362
Croatian Folkloristic Music.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.721
Ah, thanks.

27:31.920 --> 27:32.921
And I've brought something
for the girls too...

27:37.320 --> 27:38.321
Thanks

27:38.520 --> 27:42.320
You're welcome. And Susanna...

27:42.520 --> 27:43.646
Oh, you're so sweet.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.406
We didn't have this one.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.207
May I?

27:54.400 --> 27:55.162
Of course.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.526
Some wine?

27:59.720 --> 28:01.131
Yes, I'd like some..

28:05.040 --> 28:08.283
Ah... you can put
your jewels there.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.928
Is it true Laura that you
dubbed the Devil's voice?

28:12.640 --> 28:15.610
Yes, Graziella, I've
worked under the Devil..

28:15.800 --> 28:18.007
The Hollywood cinema...

28:18.200 --> 28:22.603
Help somebody who served
the Church, father.

28:32.680 --> 28:38.767
Oh.. Oh honey come here and let
me show you how communists dance,

28:38.960 --> 28:39.643
They dance,

28:39.840 --> 28:41.808
and they even dance well, look..

28:42.000 --> 28:46.767
Here you go, this way,

28:56.240 --> 28:57.127
Take it...

28:59.640 --> 29:01.130
Graziella... you should

29:01.320 --> 29:02.162
use more make-up

29:02.360 --> 29:03.725
you're so pretty..

29:03.920 --> 29:06.161
Come on Graziella, dance
with me some more...

29:12.640 --> 29:14.369
Here...

31:25.520 --> 31:26.806
Good evening.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.729
Good evening. Here.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.762
Good evening.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.405
Good evening, make
yourself at home.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.249
Thanks

31:42.240 --> 31:43.401
May I offer you some coffee?

31:43.600 --> 31:44.840
No thanks, water is just fine.

31:45.040 --> 31:45.404
How do you do?

31:45.600 --> 31:48.080
Well. Take a sit.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.651
Let's get started right away...

32:00.120 --> 32:02.646
So... In what you have written,

32:02.840 --> 32:05.286
in your articles, you gave
many versions of what you hate

32:05.480 --> 32:08.643
and therefore you have opened
a fight against institutions,

32:08.840 --> 32:12.686
ideologies, powers, and
against some people,

32:12.880 --> 32:15.645
now to make our conversation a
little bit less complicated

32:15.840 --> 32:19.526
I'll call all of this "the
situation", but it's clear

32:19.720 --> 32:23.008
that I'm referring to that scene
you usually speak against.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.248
But I want to make
this consideration,

32:25.440 --> 32:29.286
let's put that you
have a magical mind,

32:29.480 --> 32:33.371
you move your hand and
everything disappears,

32:33.560 --> 32:34.925
everything you hate.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.444
You are then alone, alone and
with no means whatsoever,

32:39.640 --> 32:40.926
with no expressive means I mean.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.608
Yes, I get it, oh,

32:45.800 --> 32:47.609
you're talking about
a magical mind...

32:47.800 --> 32:52.044
which not only I'm looking for but
which I also believe in, not because

32:52.240 --> 32:54.891
I think myself as a wizard,

32:55.080 --> 32:57.731
but because I know that
by hitting the same

32:57.920 --> 32:59.570
nail even a house can collapse.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.923
Those who made history

33:03.120 --> 33:05.327
were not the courtesans and
the cardinals' assistants

33:05.520 --> 33:07.284
but those who were
able to say "no".

33:07.480 --> 33:10.643
Refusal has always been an
essential gesture and therefore

33:10.840 --> 33:12.763
to work it needs to be

33:12.960 --> 33:15.042
great, absolute, and absurd.

33:15.240 --> 33:18.642
Common sense has never
stopped the <<situation>>.

33:19.400 --> 33:22.051
Now, we have three points:

33:22.240 --> 33:23.810
what is "the situation"

33:24.000 --> 33:26.765
why we should stop it
or even destroy it

33:26.960 --> 33:28.200
and how.

33:30.200 --> 33:35.491
Good, now explain
"the situation".

33:35.680 --> 33:38.843
You perfectly know
that what you write,

33:39.040 --> 33:43.648
and your language
have the effect of

33:43.840 --> 33:45.888
sunlight going through the dust.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.402
That is a beautiful picture
but it is hard to understand.

33:49.600 --> 33:53.047
Thank you for the
sun metaphor, but I

33:53.240 --> 33:55.607
want a lot less.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.246
I just want

33:58.440 --> 34:01.125
that you notice this tragedy.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.367
What is this tragedy?

34:02.560 --> 34:05.006
The tragedy is that there are no

34:05.200 --> 34:09.205
human beings anymore, there are only weird
cars crashing one against the other.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.607
And this tragedy started

34:11.800 --> 34:13.643
with that universal

34:13.840 --> 34:14.966
compulsory

34:15.159 --> 34:18.004
and perverse educational
system that shapes all of us,

34:18.199 --> 34:20.202
from the manager class,

34:20.400 --> 34:21.242
down to the poor.

34:21.440 --> 34:25.126
that pushes all of us
inside the arena of having

34:25.320 --> 34:26.764
everything at any cost.

34:26.960 --> 34:27.768
This is the reason

34:27.960 --> 34:29.803
why everyone wants
the same things and

34:30.000 --> 34:30.887
why they behave
all the same way.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.208
So if I have in my hands
an administration

34:34.400 --> 34:37.529
meeting or a financial
maneuver, I use those.

34:37.719 --> 34:40.007
Or I use a crowbar.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.328
And when I decide
to use a crowbar

34:42.520 --> 34:45.330
I make my violence
to get what I want.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.760
Why do I want it?

34:46.960 --> 34:48.803
Because they told me that
it's a virtue to want it.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.922
I exercise the right
to my virtue.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.282
I am a murderer, and
I am a good person.

34:53.480 --> 34:58.725
So people nowadays don't
mind killing at all..

34:58.920 --> 35:02.242
That's where the
scenery has changed,

35:02.440 --> 35:03.726
now there's the
desire to kill and

35:03.920 --> 35:06.287
this desire binds us as
sinister brothers of

35:06.480 --> 35:09.529
a sinister failure of
an entire social system

35:09.720 --> 35:13.088
that produces gladiators who
were all taught to have,

35:13.280 --> 35:14.805
possess and destroy.

35:15.720 --> 35:21.602
You see all of us as farmers
with no school education,

35:21.800 --> 35:24.087
ignorant but happy.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.004
I will spit it out for you,

35:27.200 --> 35:29.680
I descend to Hell.

35:29.880 --> 35:33.930
and I know many things that for
now won't bother your rests.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.326
But be careful.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.443
Hell is coming up to you.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.768
It's true, he wears

35:39.960 --> 35:41.041
many clothings and

35:41.240 --> 35:43.561
wears many masks.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.127
All of us are victims and
all of us are guilty.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.322
But the desire, the need...

35:48.520 --> 35:49.931
for the crowbar,

35:50.120 --> 35:51.565
to assault, to kill,

35:51.760 --> 35:53.524
is strong and is in all of us.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.802
And it won't exist much
longer the private

35:56.000 --> 35:58.128
and risky experience
of those people who...

35:58.320 --> 35:59.890
how can I put it..

36:00.080 --> 36:02.367
has touched a "violent life".

36:02.560 --> 36:04.483
But don't make a
fool of yourselves.

36:04.680 --> 36:05.567
You lot

36:05.760 --> 36:07.524
with your school

36:07.720 --> 36:08.846
your TV

36:09.040 --> 36:10.883
with the calm of your newspapers

36:11.080 --> 36:11.763
you

36:11.960 --> 36:16.488
are the great preservers
of this horrible order

36:16.680 --> 36:19.251
an order based on the idea of possessing
and on the idea of destroying.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.486
Let me get back to
the first question.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.606
You magically wipe
out everything,

36:34.800 --> 36:35.687
the compulsory school,

36:35.880 --> 36:37.689
the elected officials,

36:37.880 --> 36:38.688
the TV itself.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.730
What do you have left?

36:44.640 --> 36:45.368
Everything.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.288
I have everything left.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.481
Myself,

36:47.680 --> 36:48.841
to be alive,

36:49.040 --> 36:50.530
to be alive in the world,

36:50.720 --> 36:54.122
to see, to work, to
understand, my books

36:54.320 --> 36:55.446
My movies.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.849
I would keep making cinema even if
I were the last man on the Earth,

36:59.040 --> 37:00.690
maybe I'd keep making it

37:00.880 --> 37:02.211
because I need it

37:02.400 --> 37:05.051
because I like making
it and I would make it.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.641
Either I kill myself...
or I make it!

37:07.840 --> 37:10.844
I, I... by making cinema

37:11.040 --> 37:12.530
by making it

37:12.720 --> 37:14.085
I somehow express myself.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.328
And if this expression
of mine gets alienated,

37:16.520 --> 37:17.248
who cares!

37:17.440 --> 37:18.566
In the meanwhile I've
expressed myself

37:18.760 --> 37:19.602
as free as I could.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.327
Now enough about myself

37:26.520 --> 37:27.089
I've just

37:27.280 --> 37:28.611
talked too much about myself,

37:28.800 --> 37:29.369
everybody know that

37:29.560 --> 37:31.449
I pay my experiences

37:31.640 --> 37:33.369
on my skin, maybe
it's me who's wrong,

37:33.560 --> 37:35.562
but I'll keep telling you
that we're all in danger.

37:37.520 --> 37:40.967
Pasolini, if this is your
vision of the world,

37:41.160 --> 37:42.764
I don't know if you would
accept the question,

37:42.960 --> 37:49.081
but how can you push
back risk and danger?

37:56.080 --> 37:57.127
It got late

37:57.320 --> 37:59.607
it's better for us to stop here.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.247
Maybe you could leave
me these questions.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.930
There are too many
absolute arguments,

38:05.120 --> 38:06.042
leave me some time to
think about those.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.483
To write it's much easier
to me than to talk.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.604
I'll add some notes and I'll leave
them to you in the morning.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.171
Do you have headline?

38:26.840 --> 38:28.365
“We're all in danger?”.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.802
Damn the fascists all to Hell!

41:07.520 --> 41:08.885
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.331
Good evening, Pierpa'.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.089
Are you closing up?

41:16.280 --> 41:18.647
No, it's always opened for you,

41:18.840 --> 41:19.727
Come in, Maestro.

41:19.920 --> 41:20.842
How are you?

41:21.120 --> 41:21.564
Fine.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.531
Where have you been?

41:23.720 --> 41:25.529
In Stockholm.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.210
Ah, and what's there to see?

41:27.400 --> 41:29.971
They translated my “Le
ceneri Di Gramsci”.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.800
Ah well done!

41:32.000 --> 41:34.685
Have you felt the
tension in the streets?

41:34.880 --> 41:37.929
Two boys have been killed
right around the corner.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.566
One of them was a 16
years old fascist.

41:40.760 --> 41:43.604
And to have justice they killed someone
who had nothing to do with it.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.802
Rome it's done for, my friend.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.561
You should leave it and go
live in another country.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.091
And what should I do
in another country?

41:51.280 --> 41:52.770
I can only cook spaghetti.

41:52.960 --> 41:56.851
You can't even imagine
how many would die

41:57.040 --> 41:59.520
to eat your food in
France or in Germany.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.449
No shit... with the
disgusting food they have!

42:01.640 --> 42:05.361
Pierpa' tonight I made your stake with
a little bit of salad on the side.

42:05.560 --> 42:08.643
Good... but

42:08.840 --> 42:09.489
I'll be waiting for Ninetto.

42:09.680 --> 42:10.966
No problem.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.047
Dear Eduardo

42:34.240 --> 42:36.720
I'll write down, at last,

42:36.920 --> 42:39.207
the movie I've been talking to
you about for so many years.

42:42.880 --> 42:47.522
Oh you don't have time to go to sleep in the
evening that is already 9 o'clock in the morning!

42:49.080 --> 42:50.764
Epifénio!

42:50.960 --> 42:54.009
I'll entrust Epifanio
to you entirely:

42:54.200 --> 42:58.330
because I feel like it,
because I want to.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.522
Come here!

43:00.720 --> 43:02.927
Let's make it this way.

43:03.120 --> 43:03.962
Epifanio it's you.

43:04.160 --> 43:07.846
It's the “you” from the
dream, apparently idealized,

43:08.040 --> 43:09.201
but actually real.

43:09.400 --> 43:15.407
Carolina, you know that
coffee makes you nervous!

43:15.600 --> 43:18.285
I hope, with all
my heart, that you

43:18.480 --> 43:21.927
will like the movie, and that you
will accept to do it: but overall

43:22.120 --> 43:25.841
I hope that you'll help me and give me
the strength to face such a burden.

43:26.040 --> 43:27.644
You're drinking it
right on my face!?

43:27.840 --> 43:28.648
Look, let's do something nice.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.490
Now I go and grab
something to eat,

43:30.680 --> 43:32.728
then I come back,
and we make a good

43:32.920 --> 43:34.365
coffee, and we share it.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.130
a little bit for you and a
little bit for me. Alright?

43:36.320 --> 43:37.207
Hurry up though!

43:37.400 --> 43:38.322
Fine!

43:38.520 --> 43:39.442
Move it Epifé!

43:43.600 --> 43:46.809
Nunzio!

43:50.800 --> 43:52.040
Kid!

43:52.240 --> 43:54.481
I've just hired you and
I've to fire you already?

43:54.680 --> 43:55.522
Come on!

43:55.720 --> 43:56.369
C'mon!

43:56.560 --> 43:57.721
Up! On your feet!

43:57.920 --> 44:01.129
Move it Epifé!

44:04.120 --> 44:07.567
Don't worry, Carolina!

44:07.760 --> 44:08.363
Everything is fine!

44:08.560 --> 44:09.607
Yeah, everything is fine...

44:09.800 --> 44:10.801
I'm grabbing something to eat!

44:11.000 --> 44:12.570
Move it!

44:12.760 --> 44:13.204
On my way!

44:13.400 --> 44:14.686
Can we have some coffee?

44:14.880 --> 44:17.201
No, let's go and buy something.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.010
I want my coffee!

44:25.160 --> 44:26.286
The Messiah is born!

44:26.480 --> 44:30.121
The Messiah is born!

44:41.160 --> 44:42.400
Sorry, I'm just...

44:42.600 --> 44:43.249
Ok, no problem

45:05.280 --> 45:07.931
Epifanio, the Messiah is born!

45:15.680 --> 45:18.684
They all said it at the market!

45:18.880 --> 45:20.962
The Messiah is born!

45:21.160 --> 45:22.685
The Messiah is born!

45:22.880 --> 45:24.211
Who told you?

45:24.400 --> 45:25.208
What do you mean
by "who told me"?

45:25.400 --> 45:26.765
Everybody did!

45:26.960 --> 45:28.166
The Messiah is born!

45:28.360 --> 45:29.850
The Messiah is born!

45:30.040 --> 45:31.451
But you believe to
everything they tell you!

45:31.640 --> 45:33.085
Who knows what you've understood

45:33.280 --> 45:36.409
That time I asked you for some trouts,
you came back with anchovies!

45:36.600 --> 45:38.887
Oh well... I'm going to take a dump!

46:02.440 --> 46:04.204
The Comet!

46:04.400 --> 46:06.323
The Messiah is born!

46:06.520 --> 46:08.807
The Messiah is born!

46:10.880 --> 46:14.771
The Messiah is born!

46:46.800 --> 46:49.644
Epifanio! Where are you going?

46:49.840 --> 46:51.649
I'm going to look
for the Messiah!

46:51.840 --> 46:53.444
Dang it!

46:53.640 --> 46:55.130
Who the hell is gonna
make me some coffee now?

46:55.320 --> 46:56.731
Here! Here!

47:19.480 --> 47:20.720
Hey.

47:23.560 --> 47:25.210
How are you, Aldo?

47:25.400 --> 47:26.447
I'm fine, thanks.

47:28.200 --> 47:29.531
Hello.

47:29.720 --> 47:33.361
Ohé, hi!

47:38.480 --> 47:40.209
Go to Paolo.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.044
Here you are.

47:43.240 --> 47:45.049
You're so beautiful.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.165
Aldo, what are we going to eat?

47:48.360 --> 47:51.523
Well, tonight I'd have an exquisite
pheasant that I hunted myself...

47:51.720 --> 47:52.846
if the lady doesn't
mind though, right?

47:53.040 --> 47:54.963
Yes, yes, it's alright, and
something for the baby.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.525
Right away! Some wine?

47:56.720 --> 47:57.448
Yes, yes, wine is fine.

47:57.640 --> 47:58.402
Adriano.

47:59.920 --> 48:00.762
So?

48:00.960 --> 48:03.691
You're so beautiful.

48:03.880 --> 48:11.048
-Sweet child, Chicchetto!
-He's always hungry.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.322
He's always eating.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.241
Want some wine?

48:17.440 --> 48:18.248
Yes.

48:20.760 --> 48:21.602
Good evening.

48:21.800 --> 48:22.449
Good evening.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.127
Hello.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.651
Look at how he smiles.

48:26.840 --> 48:28.126
How much he smiles.

48:32.440 --> 48:34.283
So? Eh?

48:34.480 --> 48:35.686
What happened to dad?

49:05.320 --> 49:07.368
There you have the comet!

49:07.560 --> 49:09.050
The Messiah will be born!

49:09.240 --> 49:10.890
Let's go! Let's go!

49:31.640 --> 49:32.482
Good morning.

49:32.680 --> 49:33.727
Good morning, how are you?

49:33.920 --> 49:35.001
Good, what about you?

49:35.200 --> 49:36.964
May I see your papers?

49:37.160 --> 49:38.650
What a fine piece of
ass has that one!

49:38.840 --> 49:41.127
Are you foreigners?

49:41.320 --> 49:41.889
Yes.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.809
You can tell.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.365
Good way back.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.164
Thank you, have a good day.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.246
Morning, how are you?

49:49.440 --> 49:49.963
Fine?

49:50.160 --> 49:50.763
Fine!

49:50.960 --> 49:53.122
May I see your papers?

49:53.320 --> 49:56.722
Sure thing. Here you go.
Show him the paper, c'mon.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.890
You look smart...

50:00.080 --> 50:02.128
You're foreigners, aren't you?

50:02.320 --> 50:03.082
Yes.

50:03.280 --> 50:04.566
May I ask you a question?

50:04.760 --> 50:07.240
Do you prefer men or women?

50:07.440 --> 50:08.771
What kind of question is that?

50:08.960 --> 50:09.802
We like women, right?

50:10.000 --> 50:12.890
Oh! You have already got
used to it, haven't you?

50:13.080 --> 50:14.411
No problem.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.329
May I give you an advice?

50:16.520 --> 50:18.921
You'd better go to the bourgeois
restaurant, in the city center

50:19.120 --> 50:21.043
you will feel more comfortable.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.044
Enjoy the city.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.000
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.411
Romano! Eh?

50:43.600 --> 50:46.331
I got you!

50:46.520 --> 50:47.203
Him too?

50:47.400 --> 50:49.323
No, he stays a little
bit here and there.

50:49.520 --> 50:52.046
Are you sure you're
not even a little...

50:52.240 --> 50:53.002
Eh? No?

50:53.200 --> 50:54.440
A little what?

50:54.640 --> 50:55.926
But why are you here?

50:56.120 --> 50:57.121
I'm here for the money, though.

50:57.320 --> 51:00.130
You're lucky, you
know you're lucky.

51:00.320 --> 51:00.889
Ah really?

51:01.080 --> 51:03.890
Not only this is the most
leisured city in the world.

51:04.080 --> 51:07.004
This is the town of
lesbians and gays.

51:07.200 --> 51:10.568
And today, my friend,
you're lucky!

51:10.760 --> 51:11.921
Because we have a great event!

51:13.560 --> 51:15.085
Do you want to come?

51:15.280 --> 51:16.202
How much does it cost?

51:16.400 --> 51:17.731
It's free for you!

51:17.920 --> 51:19.445
C'mon, trust me!

51:19.760 --> 51:21.205
C'mon!

51:37.560 --> 51:38.561
Good evening.

51:38.760 --> 51:39.807
Good evening.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.611
And what should this place be?

51:43.800 --> 51:46.121
This is the Fertility Festival

51:46.320 --> 51:46.969
Ah..

51:47.160 --> 51:49.288
It's an important
thing for this city.

51:49.480 --> 51:50.447
You must understand

51:50.640 --> 51:53.291
that here at Sodoma,

51:53.480 --> 51:57.485
gays make out with gays and lesbians
make out with lesbians, all year along.

51:57.680 --> 51:59.569
But on a special day,

51:59.760 --> 52:01.364
that is today,

52:01.560 --> 52:03.005
they gather,

52:03.200 --> 52:04.440
have sex and make babies.

52:04.640 --> 52:11.125
After that, lesbians go back to be
lesbians and gays go back to be...

52:11.320 --> 52:13.084
Gays go back to be...

52:13.280 --> 52:14.930
Gays-

52:16.320 --> 52:19.130
Wait a moment, before
opening the door...

52:19.320 --> 52:21.721
shouldn't we knock?

52:21.920 --> 52:22.648
So that we don't disturb...

52:22.840 --> 52:23.648
What are you talking about?

52:23.840 --> 52:25.410
This is the city of tolerance!

52:31.760 --> 52:34.081
Dick, dick, fuck you!

52:34.280 --> 52:37.045
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

52:37.240 --> 52:40.210
Dick, dick, fuck you!

52:40.400 --> 52:43.290
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

52:43.480 --> 52:46.529
Dick, dick, fuck you!

52:46.720 --> 52:49.405
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

52:49.600 --> 52:52.649
Dick, dick, fuck you!

53:18.040 --> 53:21.567
Dick, dick, fuck you!

53:21.760 --> 53:24.764
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

53:24.960 --> 53:27.611
Dick, dick, fuck you!

53:27.800 --> 53:30.804
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

53:31.000 --> 53:33.844
Dick, dick, fuck you!

53:34.040 --> 53:37.010
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

53:37.200 --> 53:39.441
Dick, dick, fuck you!

53:39.640 --> 53:42.610
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

53:42.800 --> 53:45.724
Dick, dick, fuck you!

54:12.920 --> 54:15.287
Dick, dick, fuck you!

54:15.480 --> 54:18.324
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

54:18.520 --> 54:21.729
Dick, dick, fuck you!

54:21.920 --> 54:24.730
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

54:25.440 --> 54:28.011
Dick, dick, fuck you!

54:28.200 --> 54:31.124
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

54:31.360 --> 54:34.330
Dick, dick, fuck you!

54:34.520 --> 54:37.524
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

54:37.720 --> 54:40.644
Dick, dick, fuck you!

54:41.200 --> 54:43.407
Cunt, cunt, fuck you!

55:10.720 --> 55:11.926
It's moving.

55:12.840 --> 55:15.161
Oh yes! It's moving!

55:15.360 --> 55:16.600
We must go!

55:16.800 --> 55:18.564
Let's go! Let's go, c'mon!

55:32.440 --> 55:36.206
Epifanio's soul departs from
his body now that he's dead

55:36.400 --> 55:40.564
Nunzio a fiche waits for him and we finally
understand that he's actually an angel.

55:40.760 --> 55:43.206
Epifanio is really happy about
it and Nunzio tells him:

55:43.400 --> 55:44.526
Let's go to Heaven.

55:44.720 --> 55:46.927
So they start walking

55:47.120 --> 55:48.610
and they go up to the sky

55:48.800 --> 55:51.883
leaving planet
Earth behind them,

55:52.080 --> 55:53.764
The two of them go
far, far, far away

55:53.960 --> 55:56.042
up... but they never
reach Heaven.

55:56.240 --> 55:58.242
Epifanio asks "Where's Heaven"?

55:58.440 --> 55:59.771
Nunzio replies: "There
it is, up there.

55:59.960 --> 56:01.644
so they go up and up

56:01.840 --> 56:04.844
and up again but they
don't reach Heaven until

56:05.040 --> 56:07.520
they're too tired and they stop.

56:07.720 --> 56:09.961
Heaven doesn't exist.

56:10.160 --> 56:12.606
Epifanio takes a piss,

56:12.800 --> 56:16.247
then he turns around, and
glances at planet Earth.

56:16.440 --> 56:20.126
You can hear from
there far noises,

56:20.320 --> 56:23.369
music, voices, poor
people's songs,

56:23.560 --> 56:25.847
fashionable songs,
revolutionary songs.

56:26.040 --> 56:30.762
So Epifanio give a look at
the planet and says "At last

56:30.960 --> 56:33.964
I'm glad I've followed the star,

56:34.160 --> 56:36.083
because thanks to
it I had the chance

56:36.280 --> 56:39.170
to get to know better this
planet I love so much...

56:39.360 --> 56:42.443
So he turns to Nunzio and asks

56:42.640 --> 56:47.726
"Now what?" and Nunzio replies:
"There's no such a thing as the end.

56:47.920 --> 56:51.606
Let's wait, something
has to happen...

56:56.080 --> 56:58.606
I want to shoot this
movie as soon as I can.

57:00.640 --> 57:03.644
I'm going... Bye.

57:03.960 --> 57:05.485
Goodnight.

58:09.400 --> 58:11.368
Jack Palance, can I drive it?

58:11.560 --> 58:13.483
You don't even have
the license for it.

58:13.680 --> 58:16.081
Were have ya been?

58:16.280 --> 58:17.520
Far away.

58:40.880 --> 58:41.767
Come.

59:12.880 --> 59:13.767
That's beautiful.

59:14.760 --> 59:16.125
Did you steal it?

59:16.320 --> 59:19.403
No, a friend of
mine gave it to me,

59:19.600 --> 59:21.090
he bought it in America.

59:27.440 --> 59:29.568
How's it going tonight?

59:29.760 --> 59:32.047
I can't complain.

59:36.280 --> 59:37.520
Are you hungry?

59:37.720 --> 59:38.687
Sure!

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.203
- Good evening professor.
- Good evening.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.771
Ah thanks.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.042
Giuseppina, the
professor is here.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.563
Good evening, Professor.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.409
Good evening.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.249
Evening.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.330
What would you like to eat?

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.562
What would you like?

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.010
He will have some spaghetti
and some chicken breast..

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.726
And as for me...
I've already eaten.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.481
What can I take you to drink?

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.681
A beer for me.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.006
Nothing for me, thanks.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.007
And now... Are you working?

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.770
I work at the body
shop, now and then.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.291
Really?

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.641
Do you like it?

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.606
Well...it's a pain in the
ass, scratchin' all day.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.087
You're welcome.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.047
But... Do you like cars?

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.002
Sure.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:51.962
What about mine?

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.321
A bit, yes.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.091
I can let you drive it.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.965
I already have one but the
start engine is broken,

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.286
and I'm broke.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.084
Do you have a girlfriend?

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.167
Yes.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.644
What do you do with her?

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.768
Do you like going dancing?

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.611
Sure, she likes
going going dancing

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.687
I do too.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.881
But it's too expensive.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.162
You don't need money to dance.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.850
You always need money.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.486
But it's not like... you
get in trouble, is it?

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.602
What do you mean?

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.882
With... the police.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.404
Fuck the police
they're fuckheads.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.968
Last time they arrested me
because of some bullshit

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.288
Enjoy

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.523
It's good, isn't it?

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.130
Good evening.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.242
See you soon, professor.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.249
Why don't we go to the seaside?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.082
Yes but how long does it take?

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.441
I've got things to do.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.282
Don't worry, it's
totally worth it.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.328
Aha!

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.602
What the fuck are you doing?

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.525
Look at that sexy car,
faggot, it's yours?

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.121
What the fuck do these two faggots think
they're doing showing their asses?

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.367
What do you think?

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.450
Let me tell you what these
two faggots are doing.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.927
Take out the money, cunt.

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:39.805
Go to the car!

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.287
Get this faggot up...

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.844
You fucker...

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:23.002
Get him up... You suck so much,

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.645
Imma break your dick, fucker...

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:29.203
You cocksucker!...

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.768
Get this shithead up.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:36.850
You faggot...

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.326
You fuckhead...

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.680
You cocksucker!

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.291
I'm breaking it...

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:43.926
You really are a faggot...

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.609
You cunt!

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.444
I don't get it...

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.881
He was here.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.724
I'm sure, he was here.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.167
What?

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.247
Heaven?

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.407
Listen, I can't take it anymore!

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.161
Just like all comets,

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.160
even this comet I've
followed was bullshit.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.091
Ma senza non Fosse
stata ska strunzata,

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.648
Earth, I would have
never known you..

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.683
But... what now?

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.923
What now, nothin.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.443
There's no such a
thing as the end.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.809
Let's wait.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.528
Something has to happen.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.724
I can't take it, I
just can't tell her

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.331
that they killed
her another son.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.730
Let me tell her.
