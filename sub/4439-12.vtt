He's got a walkie.

13:44.032 --> 13:47.445
I am calm. Really.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.657
But what they said you did...

13:52.874 --> 13:55.832
I thought what happened
to Reverend Coggins was an accident.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.210
No, he was an accident
waiting to happen.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.664

burned down the whole town

But he didn't do it, did he?

14:31.829 --> 14:34.491
Oh, he did more than enough

14:34.665 --> 14:37.953
to deserve whatever punishment
he's got coming to him.

what they had coming to them.

- For what?
- The dome.

you could bring down the dome.

- Barbie shot her yesterday.

He wouldn't lie to me about that.

then Julia's the only witness, right?
