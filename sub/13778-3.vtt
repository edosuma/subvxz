00:01.460 --> 00:04.076
(sirens wailing in distance)

00:07.007 --> 00:08.167
(sighs)

00:14.640 --> 00:15.675
(speed—dial beeps)

00:16.517 --> 00:17.802
(line rings)

00:17.851 --> 00:19.432
(Voice mail) This is
Detective Luke Callaghan.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.844
Leave a message,
and I'll call you back. (beep)

00:21.897 --> 00:23.478
Hey, it's me——Andy.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.891
Obviously. Um, I don't know.
I just can't sleep.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.275
It must be the new place
or something.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.732
(sighs) Anyway, uh, well,
I guess you're still at work,

00:30.781 --> 00:32.271
so I'll just, um...

00:32.324 --> 00:34.030
see you when you get home.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.283
Okay. I love you. Bye.
(beep)

00:36.870 --> 00:39.282
(creak, clatter)

00:39.331 --> 00:40.946
Luke?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.080
(clank)

00:45.837 --> 00:46.667
Hello?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.755
(clanking)

00:53.554 --> 00:54.919
(keys jangle)

00:58.976 --> 01:00.807
(gun cocks)

01:11.029 --> 01:13.441
(clattering continues)

01:20.372 --> 01:23.956
I'm a police officer!
I am armed!

01:24.001 --> 01:25.036
I'm coming out!

01:25.085 --> 01:27.246
(door creaks)

01:34.428 --> 01:36.259
(clatter)

01:40.225 --> 01:41.681
(creak)

01:42.561 --> 01:44.051
Gross.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.220
— (barking)
— Aah!

01:46.273 --> 01:48.229
(clatter)

01:49.359 --> 01:51.611
— Stupid!
— (barking continues)

01:51.653 --> 01:52.642
Ow.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.025
(barks)

02:03.081 --> 02:05.197
(taps fingers)

02:10.172 --> 02:12.083
Oh, my God.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.218
(door closing)
Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Hey!

02:18.263 --> 02:19.252
— Y—You——You——What are you doing?
— Whoa!

02:19.306 --> 02:20.216
Don't sneak up on me like that!

02:20.265 --> 02:21.425
— | live here!
— I know!

02:21.475 --> 02:23.056
Okay. Come on. Okay.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.685
I'm gonna take this out
real slow, all right?

02:26.730 --> 02:28.721
— (laughs)
— I'm gonna put it down.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.106
Okay. Funny.
I'm sorry, okay? It's——

02:31.151 --> 02:33.016
The back gate was open.
It was making tons of noise,

02:33.070 --> 02:34.685
and it just really freaked me out,
and l...

02:34.738 --> 02:36.603
(sighs) How was your night?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.399
Long.Long.
Jimmy Cole got shot.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.407
What, that drug dealer
with the ugly moustache?

02:41.453 --> 02:42.442
Yeah. Yeah.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.781
Yeah, Luke, um...

02:44.748 --> 02:45.988
What the hell is this?

02:50.587 --> 02:53.169
Okay, this is not exactly how
I had this planned.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.708
l was thinking maybe more
a weekend at the cabin,

02:58.845 --> 03:01.052
maybe get a floatplane,
take us up to Whitestone,

03:01.098 --> 03:02.679
— watch the sunset.
— Oh, my God.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.215
I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.350
l——l was not snooping,
I promise. It's just that...

03:07.396 --> 03:08.306
No, no. lt's——lt's fine.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.311
l was scared. Well, not scared.
Obviously, it's me.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.517
But nervous, and l——l went,

03:11.566 --> 03:12.726
— and the gate was open...
— Andy, Andy.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.016
— And I think, uh...
— Andy. Andy, it's fine.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.980
— ...the neighbor's dog is possessed.
— It's great. It's great, okay?

03:16.029 --> 03:17.565
As long as it ends the same way,

03:17.614 --> 03:19.696
unless you don't want to,
and then that's fine.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.823
lt's... It's okay.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.239
I do.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.074
— You do?
— Yeah, I do.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.614
(laughs) Um...

03:37.884 --> 03:40.045
(Lukelaughs)

03:43.056 --> 03:46.219
(Jenn Grant's "Getcha Good" playing)

03:46.268 --> 03:48.008
(sirens wail in distance)

03:48.061 --> 03:50.017
J‘ Get your bag and boots on, honey J‘

03:50.063 --> 03:53.021
J‘ I've got love
but not much money for you J‘

03:53.066 --> 03:56.524
— J‘ If you want me, say you do J‘
— (faucet turns off)

03:56.570 --> 04:00.483
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to stand down.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.898
Because I'm the police.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.526
I said, stand down.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.325
Because I'm the police.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.245
(Gail, knocking)
Dov, come on! Hurry up!

04:12.294 --> 04:13.579
I need to use the bathroom.

04:13.628 --> 04:14.708
I'm not finished yet.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.336
Yeah, well,
I need to use the shower,

04:16.381 --> 04:19.088
so can you hurry up
and arrest the mirror already?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.468
— Gail.
— Mm?

04:23.513 --> 04:25.970
If you need to use the shower so bad,

04:26.016 --> 04:28.553
use the one at your own damn house.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.512
J‘ If you want me, say you do J‘

04:31.980 --> 04:34.221
That's what you meant
about bringing me coffee.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.229
(Traci laughs)

04:35.275 --> 04:38.267
I actually did bring you coffee.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.484
It's probably cold by now.

04:40.530 --> 04:44.114
You know, if you'd slept over,
I'd make you coffee——

04:44.159 --> 04:45.444
a nice latte.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.109
— Mmm.
— You'd be drinking it right now.

04:47.162 --> 04:52.247
Nah. I don't know how
I'd explain that one. (sighs)

04:52.292 --> 04:55.159
You're not married to Dex.

04:55.212 --> 05:01.378
I know, but he's Leo's dad,
and we live together right now,

05:03.261 --> 05:05.798
and I don't want to talk about that
right now.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.133
J‘ I'm gonna let ya,
I'm gonna let ya J‘

05:08.183 --> 05:10.094
J‘ I'm gonna getcha,
gonna getcha J‘

05:13.730 --> 05:16.142
Hey. I called you, like, four times
this morning.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.523
Oh. Sorry. ljust,
uh, turned my ringer off,

05:18.568 --> 05:20.980
'cause I had an appointment
this morning. Why? What's up?

05:21.029 --> 05:23.486
Oh, nothin'.
Just, um, got some new bling

05:23.532 --> 05:26.069
and wanted you to be
the first to know. (pop)

05:26.117 --> 05:27.368
Shut up.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.284
Luke gave it to me last night.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.195
That's a diamond.
That's a frickin' diamond, Andy.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.079
(chuckles) I know.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.252
That's amazing. Oh, my God.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.910
Wow. (laughs)

05:38.964 --> 05:40.795
(Jo) You girls need a minute?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.127
Andy just got engaged.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.712
— No way.
— Really?

05:44.761 --> 05:45.967
(Traci) To Detective Callaghan.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.468
Yeah, thanks. I figured.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.175
(laughs) ls that——ls that the ring?

05:49.224 --> 05:51.135
Yeah. It's, um...

05:52.519 --> 05:55.010
That's gorgeous. Congratulations.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.428
(Andy) Thank you.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.101
— Nice work, McNally.
— Thanks.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.317
Just if I were you, I wouldn't
wear it out on the street.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.569
You don't want
to make yourself a target.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.946
(locker door clicks open)

06:06.992 --> 06:08.983
(Frank) The late James Cole——

06:09.452 --> 06:12.944
Cabbagetown's friendly
neighborhood crack dealer.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.410
Took four in the chest last night,
no witnesses.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.494
lt's Callaghan's case,

06:17.544 --> 06:21.833
but if it's a turf thing, it could get
pretty ugly, so keep your eyes open.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.622
Speaking of ugly——Oliver?

06:23.675 --> 06:26.166
(laughter)

06:26.219 --> 06:27.629
All right, rooks, everybody knows

06:27.679 --> 06:29.215
that Friday shifts are bad.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.220
There's more drunk and disorderlies

06:31.266 --> 06:33.257
and more, uh, more domestics.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.016
Friday night, full moon——

06:36.271 --> 06:37.351
that's a whole different story.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.267
Diaz.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.273
Well, uh, sir,

06:42.319 --> 06:44.981
seeing as how the human body
is mostly made up of water,

06:45.030 --> 06:48.363
and the Moon's gravity's responsible
for the Earth's tides,

06:48.408 --> 06:53.152
it stands to reason
that we should be affected, too,

06:53.204 --> 06:55.331
uh, s——uh, somehow.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.579
(slow handclaps)

06:56.625 --> 06:59.992
Yeah, stupid people do stupid things.
It is in their nature.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.206
But they will do fewer stupid things

07:02.255 --> 07:05.088
if they know we're watching,
so stay sharp.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.670
Stay visible. Serve. Protect.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.176
You got any questions
about the Earth's tide,

07:10.597 --> 07:11.632
talk to Diaz.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.637
(laughter)

07:13.683 --> 07:15.093
Thanks.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.259
Oh! One more thing.

07:17.312 --> 07:21.521
I understand congratulations
are in order to McNally here

07:21.566 --> 07:24.057
on her engagement
to Detective Callaghan.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.357
Oh, hey!

07:28.406 --> 07:31.239
— (Dov) Seriously? You're getting married?
— Yeah.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.490
— Andy, way to go.
— (Chris) That's awesome.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.365
That's great.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.151
(Frank) You know, 'cause it didn't
work out for the rest of us

07:35.205 --> 07:37.742
doesn't mean that you two
shouldn't give it a try.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.328
— (Noelle laughs)
— McNally.

07:40.835 --> 07:44.453
Noelle. Beautiful Noelle.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.292
— No.
— Aw, come on. Please?

07:46.341 --> 07:48.172
No! I had him four shifts
last week.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.674
What? Only four.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.176
Ever since he got busted down,
he's been a pain in the ass.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.804
No, no.
An eager pain in the ass.

07:54.849 --> 07:58.137
Yeah, well, I think he's got
something to prove, you know.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.427
(chuckles) Hey! The thing is...

08:00.480 --> 08:01.435
(lowered voice) The thing is,
I need this to be

08:01.481 --> 08:02.812
kind of a lighter day, you know?

08:02.857 --> 08:04.597
lzzy had her pals over
for a sleepover,

08:04.651 --> 08:06.312
and l overextended myself.
I'm totally jet—lagged,

08:06.361 --> 08:08.397
— and I think I screwed up my back.
— Not happening.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.481
l'll ride with him.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.064
Officer Epstein——l'll ride with him.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.359
You're not a training officer.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.495
Technically, Dov just has to ride
with a supervising officer,

08:19.541 --> 08:22.283
and I can supervise and report in to you
at the end of the day.

08:23.753 --> 08:24.959
Yeah. I like the sound of that.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.620
Yeah, but you just have
to make it clear to Dov

08:26.673 --> 08:29.836
that I'm...
his supervising officer.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.920
You know, just so there's no confusion.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.256
(chuckles) I like this one.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.048
Look, just...

08:38.101 --> 08:39.261
keep him out of trouble, okay?

08:39.310 --> 08:40.925
Yep. Got it, sir.

08:40.979 --> 08:44.062
Okay. He doesn't need
to prove anything. Not today.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.147
So... (sighs)
You're pregnant?

08:50.196 --> 08:53.154
What?
No, I am not pregnant.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.939
Oh, it just seems like the——

08:54.993 --> 08:56.904
this engagement thing
happened pretty quickly.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.318
I figured, you know,
maybe you didn't——

08:58.371 --> 09:00.236
needed to move things along and...

09:00.290 --> 09:02.827
Luke and I do live together.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.741
Right. What's it been? How long?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.327
I mean, when you know, you know.

09:10.133 --> 09:13.170
I mean,
it's not like I wasn't surprised.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.302
Oh, yeah? What, did he hide
the ring in a cupcake?

09:16.347 --> 09:17.883
No.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.345
Yeah, Callaghan's probably more
of a skywriting kind of guy.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.602
— Was a plane involved?
— No, it wasn't. It was... simple.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.433
Oh.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.686
Well, actually, |——| kinda found the ring
in Luke's stuff,

09:29.736 --> 09:32.352
and then he came home,
and itjust happened.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.861
You found it in his stuff...

09:33.907 --> 09:35.113
— Yeah, but I wasn't snooping.
— ...and then it just happened.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.490
Yeah, it happened,
but it——in a good way.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.992
Okay. And you said yes.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.494
Why wouldn't I?

09:41.539 --> 09:44.747
It was spontaneous and romantic,

09:44.793 --> 09:46.624
and,uh”.

09:46.669 --> 09:47.658
it's a good thing.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.873
(dispatcher on radio) Available units,
we've got a 2—car collision

09:49.923 --> 09:52.630
in front of 1083 Emerson,
corner of Emerson and Wall.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.047
1505. Mark us.
We're on our way.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.551
(siren whoops, wailing)

10:04.646 --> 10:05.476
Whoa! Look out!

10:06.064 --> 10:07.804
(brakes screech, thud)

10:07.857 --> 10:10.269
— Whoa!
— (Sam) Use the sidewalk, buddy!

10:17.492 --> 10:18.857
(Andy) This is 1505.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.775
We're on the scene of a 1083.
We need a bus.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.532
— (Sam) We need you to clear the street here, folks.
— Sir, are you okay?

10:23.581 --> 10:26.448
— Right of way. It was my go.
— Yeah, I know. I'm sure it was.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.037
(sighs) I can't undo this thing.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.121
That's okay. You know what?
Just sit tight.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.910
Um, we're gonna get you
out of here in a few minutes.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.872
Driver seems okay.
He's just a bit shaken up.

10:34.926 --> 10:38.384
Yeah, well, this guy was in good enough
shape to take off.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.636
— The guy we almost hit?
— I guess so.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.549
— Well, looks like he ran the stop sign.
— Yeah.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.138
Or maybe he just didn't want
to get caught with something.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.142
What, like drugs?

10:47.188 --> 10:48.473
I don't know.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.514
(zipper opens)

10:53.027 --> 10:54.358
Ohh!

10:54.404 --> 10:56.520
(Sam coughs and chuckles)
Okay.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.529
Not what I expected.

10:59.576 --> 11:00.861
Hmm...

11:02.287 --> 11:04.699
(man on PA) Officer Graham
to the Sergeant's Desk.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.783
Officer Graham to the service desk.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.448
(Chris) So you think we'll be
in the wedding party?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.992
You know,
for Andy and Luke's wedding?

11:11.045 --> 11:13.661
I'm not really sure
they've thought that far ahead.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.296
It all happened pretty fast.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.457
Oh. I don't know.
They bought a house together.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.886
Kinda makes sense.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.668
Yeah.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.554
You and Dex gonna get married?

11:24.642 --> 11:27.384
Yeah, no. I'm not really
into the whole marriage thing.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.393
I am. Totally.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.304
(chuckles) I can't wait
to have a big family.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.436
Well, you don't have to be married
to have a family, Chris.

11:34.485 --> 11:38.979
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I guess I, um...

11:40.158 --> 11:43.116
I guess I just kinda always saw myself,
uh, you know, getting married.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.651
It's weird, but I kinda can't wait.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.864
Excuse me.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.870
(lowered voice)
Does Gail know that?

11:49.876 --> 11:53.368
Um, I'm here about the murder,
the one in the news.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.083
— The one in Cabbagetown?
— That's right. The shooting.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.669
Okay. Do you have any information,
anything that might be helpful?

11:59.802 --> 12:03.636
If I could tell you who the killer was,
would that be helpful?

12:05.683 --> 12:07.514
Yes. Yes, it would.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.139
Well, I stopped at the sign.
It was my go.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.684
I hit the gas and suddenly, bam!
Out of nowhere.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.647
Then buddy just takes off.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.438
(Andy) Okay, well, these medics
are gonna take you to St. Pat's

12:21.491 --> 12:22.355
and get you checked out.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.660
(Jerry) Whoa, whoa.
Not until I talk to him first.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.818
Okay. Um, anything else?

12:26.871 --> 12:28.156
(Sam) Not your best day either, huh?

12:28.206 --> 12:30.242
Whoa! There they are.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.327
That's fantastic.
What've we got?

12:32.377 --> 12:35.164
I got three human heads——
two male, possibly one female.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.828
— Possibly?
— You tell me, man.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.335
Yeah, no.
That——That one's a girl.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.751
— There's hardly any blood, though.
(camera beeps and clicks)

12:43.388 --> 12:46.300
Yeah, looks like the vics were drained
before their heads were removed.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.839
Hmm. Neat freak.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.349
Okay, all the witnesses gave,
um, the same description——

12:50.395 --> 12:52.727
white guy, early 20s,
brown hair, brown coat.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.353
Same guy we saw fleeing the scene.

12:54.399 --> 12:59.143
Car's registered to a Tanya Makin,
619 Seaton Lane.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.901
(Jerry) Okay, so, uh, I'm gonna call

13:00.947 --> 13:02.858
and see if I can get an ID
on Peter, Paul, and Mary here.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.614
You two go to Seaton, and I'll get a TAC
to meet you there with a warrant.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.025
— Sounds good.
— All right.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.114
(camera beeps and clicks)

13:10.164 --> 13:12.371
Ugh. What kind of person
cuts people's heads off

13:12.417 --> 13:13.748
and drives around with 'em?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.249
Day like today,
you got two options——

13:15.295 --> 13:16.660
either werewolves or zombies.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.795
— I'd give it to the werewolves.
— Why?

13:21.426 --> 13:23.462
Everybody knows zombies can't drive.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.422
(starts engine)

13:29.434 --> 13:31.220
You could've at least let me drive.

13:31.269 --> 13:34.102
You wanna drive so badly,
take out your own damn squad car.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.559
Oh, wait. You're not allowed.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.562
(laughs sarcastically)

13:37.608 --> 13:38.768
Is that how you want to play this?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.730
Dov, I'm not playing, okay?
I'm just doing myjob.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.860
Check it out.
Up ahead on the left.

13:45.908 --> 13:46.943
(men shouting)

13:46.993 --> 13:48.529
(siren whoops)

13:48.578 --> 13:50.694
— (Dov) Do you smell that?
— (Gail) What?

13:50.747 --> 13:52.237
Sweet redemption.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.996
— Stay in the car.
— I got this.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.124
— That's an order.
(click, feedback)

13:56.169 --> 13:58.285
(Gail on loudspeaker)
Hey, numb—nuts! This is the police.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.829
— Stop fighting now.
— (man) Don't worry about it!

14:00.882 --> 14:03.339
Bravo.
Excellent work, Officer Peck.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.124
(men continue shouting)

14:05.178 --> 14:08.921
lt's last warning,
and then I'm gonna tase you.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.056
That is 50,000 volts
straight into the junk.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.342
Hey!

14:18.900 --> 14:19.764
(loudspeaker clicks off)

14:20.651 --> 14:22.152
(seat belt clicks)

14:25.239 --> 14:26.399
I had it.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.780
I know.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.565
I heard you practicing,
remember?

14:32.705 --> 14:33.945
(exhales deeply)

14:38.795 --> 14:41.286
(knocks on door)
Tanya Makin!

14:43.132 --> 14:45.384
— Police! Hands up!
— (gasps) Whoa! Okay!

14:46.928 --> 14:48.509
— (TAC officer) All clear.
— (Andy) Thank you.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.420
When's the last time you saw it?

14:51.474 --> 14:54.090
I parked it outside on the street
last night after my shift.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.804
I swear, I thought it was still outside.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.808
And where do you work?

14:56.854 --> 14:59.106
At the Pump & Grind coffee house
on College.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.649
Okay, you have no idea
who might've taken it?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.477
— I mean, did you lend it to anyone?
— No.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.233
— Husband?
— No.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.143
Yeah, I guess you're a bit young
to be married.

15:06.197 --> 15:09.405
A lot of boxes, Tanya.
You planning on going somewhere?

15:12.203 --> 15:14.865
My roommate left me a couple weeks ago
and stuck me with the rent.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.450
Look, I don't know
what's going on here, okay?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.740
I just know that you guys
are busting into my apartment,

15:18.793 --> 15:19.908
telling me that my car is gone.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.041
I would just really appreciate it

15:21.087 --> 15:22.918
if somebody would explain to me
what's going on.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.875
It's okay. It's okay.
(cell phone rings)

15:26.551 --> 15:27.791
(ring)
Excuse me.

15:27.844 --> 15:31.052
Yeah, Jerry, go.
No, she's clean.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.304
We found some evidence
of a crime in your trunk.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.885
What? What kind of crime?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.140
Well, that's still under investigation.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.722
No, no, no, no, no. My laptop
got lifted from work last week.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.352
That's still under investigation,

15:40.398 --> 15:41.888
but I didn't get a visit
from a SWAT team.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.273
Uh, Tanya, you know anybody
who works at Victoria Mercy?

15:44.318 --> 15:45.854
— What, the hospital?
— Yeah.

15:45.903 --> 15:46.892
No, why?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.528
Okay. Uh, we're good.
Thank you.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.610
Well, um, a detective will be in touch
with you about your car.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.819
Whoa. What, that's it?

15:52.869 --> 15:55.155
Well, for now, but, look,
in the meantime,

15:55.204 --> 15:57.536
if you think of anyone that matches
that description we gave you,

15:57.582 --> 15:59.163
caH,okay?
This is my direct line.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.747
(Andy) Hey, what's going on?
What'd Jerry say?

16:04.422 --> 16:07.914
Victoria Mercy's lab reported
three cadavers with missing heads.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.923
Cadavers? You think they go
with the heads we found?

16:11.345 --> 16:12.926
I can't believe ljust asked you that.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.054
Nothing gets by you,
does it, McNally?

16:15.099 --> 16:17.636
Oh, kinda like the bit about
being too young to be married?

16:17.685 --> 16:20.927
No. Nothing gets by me.
(slams door closed)

16:21.230 --> 16:23.516
(Traci) She says she can identify
James Cole's shooter——

16:23.566 --> 16:25.557
a junkie named
Michelle Turner, mid—20s.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.441
She even gave us
the last known address.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.852
And she saw Cole get shot?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.611
She says she's a neighbor.

16:30.656 --> 16:31.771
What's her name?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.440
(Chris) Uh, she wouldn't tell us.
She doesn't want to get involved.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.701
Okay, so she's willing to give up
the shooter by name

16:36.746 --> 16:37.781
with no evidence?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.905
Guess we brought you in
a little too soon.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.620
Yeah, that's, uh, that's fine.
Just try and figure out who she is

16:43.669 --> 16:45.921
and see if she has a beef
with this Michelle Turner, okay?

16:45.963 --> 16:46.952
— Will do.
— Okay.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.917
— Oh! And Detective Callaghan?
— Yeah.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.467
Uh, congratulations,

16:50.510 --> 16:51.920
you know, on you and Andy.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.254
We're all, uh...

16:53.721 --> 16:55.461
We're all really excited for...

16:56.390 --> 16:57.971
Thanks.

16:58.935 --> 16:59.970
(clears throat)

17:00.978 --> 17:02.593
(telephones ringing)

17:02.647 --> 17:04.228
(Jo) Hey.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.229
Thought you were staying home today,
getting some sleep.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.483
— Yeah, well, um... (sighs)
— Oh. Yeah. (chuckles)

17:09.529 --> 17:10.939
You don't sleep well during the day.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.697
Nash and Diaz, uh, may have
a witness in the Cole murder.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.028
— Oh, great. Anything solid?
— We'll see.

17:18.538 --> 17:22.907
That was an absolutely gorgeous ring
you gave McNally this morning.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.167
Or was that last night?
I'm really not clear on the details.

17:26.796 --> 17:27.956
(Jerry) Callaghan!

17:28.005 --> 17:29.120
Brother.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.540
True? False?
You locking it down with McNally?

17:32.593 --> 17:34.834
Yeah. Yeah, locking it down.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.344
— Great.
— Hey, how'd you get so lucky?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.756
What's this I hear on the wire
about three heads in a duffel bag?

17:39.809 --> 17:43.051
Oh, yeah, yeah. No. They——They were
stolen from the lab at the Old Vic.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.059
Hmm.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.766
Yeah, I got Sammy down there
right now

17:45.815 --> 17:47.305
with your fiancee.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.690
(chuckles) Yeah,
let's just call her McNally.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.815
Okay.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.064
So I guess we should probably
start talking bachelor party.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.732
(laughs) That's my cue.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.821
Congratulations, detective.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.702
(siren walls in distance)

18:05.418 --> 18:06.874
(Andy) Hey! E-121-A.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.205
Well... (sighs)

18:09.255 --> 18:11.462
These heads——You think
it's just some innocent prank?

18:11.507 --> 18:14.795
Try using the words "severed heads"
and "innocent" in the same sentence.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.380
— I really want to hear that one.
— Shut up. (chuckles)

18:16.429 --> 18:18.545
"E—110."
What, did we pass it?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.465
lt's E—121—A. Okay.
You go that way. I'll go this way.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.677
— You can give me a call.
— Okay.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.805
Excuse me, sir?

18:31.027 --> 18:32.858
Hey.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.234
(radio squelch)
Hey, Sam, I got him.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.110
Have you reached——
Stop!

18:35.156 --> 18:36.612
(beeps and buzzes)

18:38.993 --> 18:40.483
(grunting)

18:43.998 --> 18:46.330
(breathing hard) Put your hands up!
Put 'em up.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.410
(door closes)

18:48.085 --> 18:51.418
What do you want?
I'm busy... "McNally."

18:51.464 --> 18:53.500
| just want to talk to you
about the car accident this morning,

18:53.549 --> 18:55.710
about the car you stole.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.421
I didn't steal a car.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.676
Yeah, I think you did.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.427
Come on. Put your hands up.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.213
Why are you lying?
I didn't steal anything.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.178
Ohh. (radio squelch)
Sam, I got him in the lab.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.353
— Just come get over here right now——
— I gotta go.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.510
— No! Get over here!
— Help!

19:07.563 --> 19:10.225
Aah! N0! Aah!

19:15.154 --> 19:17.019
— (man) Help! McNally!
— (grunting)

19:17.073 --> 19:19.234
— (door handle rattles)
— Don't touch me!

19:23.079 --> 19:25.491
(man, raging) Aah! No!

19:25.539 --> 19:28.497
Aah! McNally! No!

19:28.542 --> 19:30.078
— (Andy) Ohh!
— (man grunts)

19:30.127 --> 19:32.960
Aah! Aah!

19:33.005 --> 19:34.916
Ohh! (groans)

19:36.592 --> 19:38.378
— You okay?
— Yeah, I'm okay. Just go. Go!

19:42.807 --> 19:45.799
(panﬂng)

19:49.105 --> 19:51.312
Ow. (panting)

19:53.192 --> 19:54.932
— Are you sure you're okay?
— Yeah, I'm okay.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.019
— What?
— He bit me.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.987
— it's fine. Seriously.
— Ow.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.452
— And you're sure?
— He didn't even break the skin.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.831
— Okay, but you start to transform...
(door closes)

20:10.876 --> 20:12.412
I ain't gonna think twice.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.576
(Pathologist) Daniel Baird——

20:13.629 --> 20:16.166
one of my research residents.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.043
Why would he be stealing
the heads off cadavers?

20:19.093 --> 20:21.209
I haven't the faintest idea.
It makes no sense to me.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.877
I mean, he had full access here.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.512
— He can get in and out anytime?
— Yeah, absolutely.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.139
When was the last time
you saw him?

20:27.184 --> 20:28.845
Oh, let's see, uh...

20:28.894 --> 20:30.600
he hasn't been in for three shifts,

20:30.646 --> 20:32.147
but that's not unusual.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.646
I mean, we are a hospital.
People do get sick.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.978
| just went three rounds with him
down the hall.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.689
Could he have a drug problem?

20:39.739 --> 20:43.197
If you're asking whether he had access
to the pharmacy, no.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.358
What about friends?
I mean——nice guy, social?

20:45.411 --> 20:46.446
(Pathologist)
What do you mean?

20:46.495 --> 20:47.996
She means, is he weird?

20:48.038 --> 20:51.530
I work 60 hours a week
down here by choice.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.495
I think I'm the wrong person to ask.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.251
Okay.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.047
— Trace.
— Mm?

21:00.092 --> 21:00.956
Guess what I found.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.625
A list of wedding halls
for Andy and Luke.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.135
No. I've got an ID
on our reluctant witness.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.466
— Go, Chris.
— Yeah.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.506
I checked the security cameras
in the lot out front.

21:08.559 --> 21:09.924
Guess who came here
in her own car.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.217
— Oh, no, she didn't.
— Yeah.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.261
Ran the plates.
She lives in Hamilton.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.179
Hamilton?
So she's no neighbor?

21:15.232 --> 21:18.019
No, not even close.
Her name's Cecile Edwards.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.400
— Edwards?
— Yeah.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.233
There's definitely a connection
between Cecile Edwards

21:23.282 --> 21:25.694
and Michelle Turner,
the woman she lD'd as the shooter.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.241
Cecile Edwards is her mother.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.126
Were you even gonna tell me?

21:38.172 --> 21:40.584
Jo, I do not need to ask
your permission to marry Andy.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.874
Well, you do when you give her my ring.

21:42.927 --> 21:47.341
It was never your ring.
You said no.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.596
Yeah, and yet you hung on to it
all these years.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.178
It's something
you were gonna give me.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.888
Something you're now giving——

21:53.521 --> 21:54.431
have given——

21:54.480 --> 21:56.095
to some doe—eyed little rookie.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.058
She found it.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.064
All right?

22:06.575 --> 22:09.783
She found it,
which is great by me.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.694
The only thing that mattered in that
was her answer,

22:11.747 --> 22:13.112
not where the ring came from.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.575
Of course it matters.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.493
(laughs to himself)

22:19.547 --> 22:21.503
You wanted different things,

22:22.550 --> 22:23.790
and l respected that,

22:25.970 --> 22:29.178
but you do not get to come in here now
and do this

22:29.223 --> 22:31.805
because I am happy
with someone who's not you.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.221
Okay.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.103
Okay. Clean slate.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.735
Is this the Michelle Turner?

22:45.781 --> 22:48.318
(Cecile) Mm—hmm. Yes.
That's——That's her.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.278
That's the girl that did the shooting.

22:50.327 --> 22:53.535
Uh, Mrs. Edwards,
w—we know that——

22:53.581 --> 22:55.537
Michelle Turner is your daughter.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.157
So?

22:59.086 --> 23:00.872
She still went out with that Cole boy,

23:01.797 --> 23:04.914
and he got her hooked on drugs,
and they fought all the time,

23:04.967 --> 23:08.334
and I'm sure——
I'm sure she killed him.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.129
Ma'am, uh, we checked
with Hamilton PD,

23:11.181 --> 23:14.469
and we know that you filed
a missing persons report

23:14.518 --> 23:15.974
18 months ago on Michelle.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.102
Is she still missing?

23:18.147 --> 23:19.808
Look, that report——

23:19.857 --> 23:24.146
lt sat on the desk inactive
for almost a year.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.103
She's 27 years old.

23:29.241 --> 23:34.201
She worked on the street,
and they tell me she has a high score.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.861
She's low priority.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.078
I just figured if——if I told you

23:39.126 --> 23:41.742
that she did something bad
like murdered,

23:41.795 --> 23:46.164
you would go out and look for her
like she was important.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.632
(sighs) So what does this mean?

23:52.681 --> 23:55.297
That nobody's gonna
do anything, right?

23:55.351 --> 23:56.966
Uh, I'm——

23:58.020 --> 24:00.853
I'm afraid if she's got nothing
to do with the case, then...

24:00.898 --> 24:02.354
I won't waste your time anymore.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.434
Ms. Edwards.

24:04.902 --> 24:07.735
We're gonna print out
your daughter's file, okay?

24:07.780 --> 24:08.860
You can read through it,

24:08.906 --> 24:10.862
and if there's anything
that you can think of,

24:10.908 --> 24:13.741
just go ahead and write it down.
I mean,

24:13.786 --> 24:15.322
maybe there's something
that we missed.

24:15.371 --> 24:18.534
(exhales deeply,
laughs to herself)

24:18.582 --> 24:19.822
Thank you.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.082
Okay. Have a seat.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.544
(jangles keys)

24:25.589 --> 24:27.830
What'd the super say?

24:27.883 --> 24:30.340
Quiet. Keeps to himself.
Pays his rent on time.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.672
TYpical psycho stuff.

24:37.685 --> 24:38.925
Daniel?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.388
It's the police.

24:41.939 --> 24:44.430
(flies buzzing)

24:45.484 --> 24:49.853
God. Looks like Dov and Chris's place.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.441
Well, Dov's half, anyway.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.481
(door creaks)

24:59.039 --> 25:01.781
Ooh. Except for maybe this.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.337
(Andy) And those.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.749
Uh, they definitely don't have those.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.542
Brains? That's gross.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.586
Ohh.

25:19.727 --> 25:20.716
Clozapine.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.179
What's Clozapine?

25:22.229 --> 25:23.435
Antipsychotics.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.222
So Daniel's schizophrenic?

25:26.275 --> 25:28.516
I guess so. These are dated
from a month ago.

25:28.569 --> 25:29.979
(pills rattle)
They're still full.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.065
So what's he want with brains?

25:32.114 --> 25:34.230
(sighs and chuckles) I don't know,

25:34.283 --> 25:36.444
and I doubt it would make much sense
to us, anyway,

25:36.493 --> 25:38.484
but, uh, I do suggest
we figure out where he is,

25:38.537 --> 25:41.529
before he decides to cut the head off
somebody who isn't already dead.

25:44.835 --> 25:47.668
50 bUCkS says there's something
happening inside that bag——

25:47.713 --> 25:49.669
spray paint, illegal fireworks.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.172
Those guys? No way.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.505
There's way too much apathy going on
over there for pyrotechnics.

25:55.554 --> 25:59.012
— Weed.
— (chuckles) We don't have cause.

25:59.058 --> 26:02.175
I can find cause.
Gail, I need to make an arrest, all right?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.216
No.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.601
You know, this power trip

26:04.646 --> 26:06.261
isn't gonna make me want you
as a roommate

26:06.315 --> 26:07.896
any more than I already don't.

26:07.941 --> 26:08.896
Whatever.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.228
I pay my share of the rent now.
Chris wants me there,

26:11.278 --> 26:13.018
so you're just gonna have to man up
and deal with it.

26:13.072 --> 26:16.189
Oh, Iwill.
Only 'cause I can wait you out.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.857
Wait. You think that Chris and l
aren't gonna last?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.321
Actually, I don't know how
you lasted this long.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.577
I mean, you guys have nothing
in common with each other.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.659
Chris is a totally good person.

26:24.708 --> 26:25.868
And I'm not?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.078
I don't know. You tell me.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.243
Why'd you volunteer to be
my partner today?

26:29.296 --> 26:32.254
To mess with me?
To kick me while I'm down?

26:33.634 --> 26:36.421
Dov, I volunteered to be
your partner today,

26:36.470 --> 26:38.176
because nobody else wanted you.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.963
Do you think you're
impressing the T.O.s

26:41.016 --> 26:43.052
with this whole
"dive in headfirst" thing?

26:43.102 --> 26:44.217
You're not.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.225
You're just proving you're not ready.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.858
(Andy) What exactly am I looking for?

26:53.904 --> 26:57.863
(Sam) For something with an address.
Anything——friends, family,

26:57.908 --> 26:59.990
something that gives us an idea
where he might hide out

27:00.035 --> 27:01.024
when he's not here.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.820
I got a Jim and Dina Baird.
Bend, Oregon.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.578
Long way from home.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.578
Yeah, with nobody to check up on him.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.799
— Hey, hey.
— Mm—hmm?

27:14.842 --> 27:15.831
Check this out.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.628
(click)

27:17.678 --> 27:19.259
Uh, hey.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.384
Uh, this is Daniel.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.887
Um...

27:22.933 --> 27:26.016
Yeah, this is one week
at half a dose,

27:26.061 --> 27:28.347
so... uh, things are good.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.638
Um, things are a little bit clearer,
less fog.

27:30.691 --> 27:31.931
GypeS)

27:31.984 --> 27:33.975
Hey, um...

27:34.027 --> 27:37.155
uh, nine days,
uh, off of medication,

27:37.197 --> 27:39.483
and, uh, I think things are good.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.569
(chuckles) I've just probably
been going to the coffee shop

27:41.618 --> 27:44.485
a little too much,
uh, which is——which is——

27:44.538 --> 27:46.153
which is understandable, so, uh...

27:46.206 --> 27:47.946
GypeS)

27:48.000 --> 27:49.456
Headaches are a problem.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.200
They're consistent,

27:51.253 --> 27:54.120
and appetite has pretty much gone.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.788
I need to, uh...

27:56.842 --> 27:58.878
not go down the road
of the D2 receptors.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.794
That's... not possible.

28:01.847 --> 28:02.927
GypeS)

28:04.975 --> 28:07.842
Aah! Aah!

28:08.520 --> 28:10.306
Aah!

28:10.355 --> 28:11.686
Jeez.

28:11.732 --> 28:12.972
GypeS)

28:14.109 --> 28:17.317
(pants) If you can complete the circles
in the right direction

28:17.362 --> 28:19.614
and you can complete...

28:19.656 --> 28:22.193
(sighs) the communication
between them all,

28:22.701 --> 28:23.656
that's...
(fingersnap)

28:24.328 --> 28:26.614
(sighs) that's when things
start to fire properly.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.073
Sounds like he's trying
to cure himself.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.704
— (Daniel) And if you don't have that...
— A transplant.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.916
...the brain doesn't function properly.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.044
(Daniel) I'm lucky.

28:36.089 --> 28:40.082
(Andy) Hey, remember Tanya saying
that her laptop was stolen?

28:40.719 --> 28:41.959
Well, the coffee house
where she works

28:42.012 --> 28:43.172
is between here and the hospital.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.053
(Andy) Whoa.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.510
Hey.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.224
(phone beeps)

28:58.737 --> 29:00.068
Hey, Tanya.
lt's Officer McNally.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.694
Give me a call as soon
as you get this, okay? l——l——

29:02.574 --> 29:04.656
Lock your doors
and don't go anywhere.

29:04.701 --> 29:05.690
We're on our way.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.245
Yeah, I was getting to that.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.873
(keys clatter)

29:38.777 --> 29:40.984
You know, it's really not that kid's fault.
(siren wailing)

29:41.029 --> 29:43.520
I mean, he's just trying to get better.
He can't control it.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.029
That kid stole heads.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.940
He was diagnosed,
prescribed medication.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.575
He chose to go off his medication.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.121
In my book, that makes him responsible.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.744
Yeah, but he didn't ask
for this to happen.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.576
McNally, things happen to us
all the time.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.116
It doesn't mean we can't choose
how we react.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.205
Is this you trying to be
subtle again?

29:58.547 --> 29:59.627
(cell phone ringing)

30:00.299 --> 30:01.254
Is that Tanya?

30:01.300 --> 30:02.961
No, it's Luke.

30:04.803 --> 30:05.838
(ring, beep)

30:07.097 --> 30:08.553
(voice mail)
Hey, you've reached Andy.

30:08.598 --> 30:11.180
Leave me a message after the beep.
(beep)

30:11.226 --> 30:13.217
Hey, it's me. Uh...

30:14.313 --> 30:15.223
I'm home early.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.688
I'll see you when you get here.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.817
(siren wailing)

30:23.822 --> 30:25.437
(dog barking)

30:27.868 --> 30:30.735
(Sam, lowered voice)
Shh, shh! The door's open.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.913
Police! We're coming in!

30:44.718 --> 30:47.209
Tanya! This is the police!

30:48.680 --> 30:49.965
Tanya, it's Officer McNally!

30:51.641 --> 30:54.132
Oh! Oh! Please, no!
Is he gone?! Is he gone?!

30:54.186 --> 30:55.096
(Sam) He's gone. He's gone.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.134
We're clear!

30:56.188 --> 30:59.396
— (Andy) Are you okay?
— (voice breaking) Yeah, I'm okay.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.435
(sniffles) | just came home,
and he was here.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.851
— He was here in my living room.
— Daniel Baird?

31:03.904 --> 31:06.441
Yeah. Yeah,
I recognized him from work.

31:06.490 --> 31:07.445
He comes in all the time.

31:07.491 --> 31:08.981
I mean, he's a little weird,

31:09.034 --> 31:10.774
but usually he's pretty sweet,
you know?

31:11.495 --> 31:14.578
He just kept saying that he——
that I didn't have to leave him,

31:14.623 --> 31:16.830
that he was gonna——
he just needed more time.

31:16.875 --> 31:17.864
Did he hurt you?

31:17.918 --> 31:20.534
No, I hit him over the head
with this——this lamp,

31:20.587 --> 31:23.044
and then——and then——
and then I heard your car,

31:23.090 --> 31:24.751
and I told him that the police
were coming,

31:24.800 --> 31:26.506
and then he took the phone
out of my hand, and he——

31:26.551 --> 31:29.008
and he chucked——oh, my God.
He chucked it against the wall.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.591
Okay. Just calm down.
Take a breath. You're safe now.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.755
Any idea where he went?

31:32.808 --> 31:34.298
No, I don't have any idea
where he went.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.637
I ran upstairs, and l locked myself
in the bathroom.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.309
He just kept screaming.

31:38.355 --> 31:41.347
He kept screaming that the police
were trying to poison my mind

31:41.400 --> 31:43.186
and that they didn't
want us to be together?!

31:44.403 --> 31:46.485
And you——
He even knew who you were.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.020
I mean, he kept screaming
your name, like,

31:48.073 --> 31:49.984
"McNally, McNally, McNally, McNally!"

31:50.033 --> 31:53.617
and, like, and that he was gonna find you
and he was gonna stop your lies.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.050
Hey.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.513
Hey.

32:19.354 --> 32:20.434
What's your name?

32:20.480 --> 32:21.720
Luke.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.938
Luke Callaghan.
What's yours?

32:23.984 --> 32:27.192
l'm Daniel. Daniel Baird.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.938
Does McNally live here?

32:32.325 --> 32:33.826
Andy McNally?

32:33.869 --> 32:35.530
She's not home right now, Daniel.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.903
What can I do for you?

32:38.748 --> 32:40.249
She's lying,

32:41.168 --> 32:42.248
and...

32:45.839 --> 32:47.295
she's ruining everything.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.422
Okay, let's talk about that, all right?

32:49.468 --> 32:51.254
I can fix it.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.507
Tanya doesn't have to know.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.642
Tanya? No, no. She doesn't.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.723
All right?
|——|'|| tell her that, Daniel.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.478
She doesn't have to know
anything, all right?

33:08.195 --> 33:09.355
You're police.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.232
Yeah.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.730
Daniel, I'm a detective.
l'm Luke Calla——

33:18.330 --> 33:20.116
(grunting, gasping)

33:43.813 --> 33:45.769
(groaning)

33:54.324 --> 33:57.316
(police radio chatter)

33:57.369 --> 33:59.860
(dispatcher) 1519, we've got
a noise complaint in your area.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.619
952 Armstrong.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.326
— May |?
— Yeah.

34:04.543 --> 34:07.376
Dispatch, Mark 1519.
We're on it.

34:26.356 --> 34:28.813
(gears shift, engine turns off)

34:32.487 --> 34:35.229
Hey, Dov. 952's over here.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.442
Excuse me, sir.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.947
(Gail) Oh, Dov. Seriously.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.028
Can I talk to you for a second?

34:40.036 --> 34:42.027
You seen anything unusual tonight?

34:42.080 --> 34:45.538
(sighs) Replace the superior gyrus.
4 00's cerebrospinal fluid.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.418
You been drinking, sir?

34:47.460 --> 34:51.328
Drinking? No. No.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.373
(police radio chatter)

34:54.426 --> 34:55.711
You're the police.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.795
What gave it away?

34:57.721 --> 34:59.086
Sir, I'm gonna need
to see some lD.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.932
(pats hip)

35:06.896 --> 35:08.978
(Velcro rips)

35:19.242 --> 35:21.198
(Andy) So the car's gonna
take you to the station,

35:21.244 --> 35:23.109
keep you safe
until we've located Daniel.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.996
Okay. Look, I don't understand.
Why me?

35:26.374 --> 35:29.207
Uh, you were nice to him
at the coffee shop.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.035
Maybe he thinks
he was in love with you.

35:32.922 --> 35:35.083
So wait. Wait. When he said
he needed more time,

35:35.133 --> 35:36.919
what did——what's he gonna do?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.050
(opens door)
He's trying to fix himself?

35:39.095 --> 35:40.551
Maybe that way you'll love him back.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.508
That's crazy.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.592
Yeah.

35:48.355 --> 35:49.720
(Dov) Do you need
some medical attention?

35:49.773 --> 35:51.513
(Daniel) You don't know what it's like
when you're out at night.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.348
(beep)

35:53.401 --> 35:54.982
(Dov) I need you to focus
and talk to me.

35:55.028 --> 35:56.108
Are you hurt?

35:56.154 --> 36:00.864
l... ljust——| gotta go.
I don't have a lot of time.

36:00.909 --> 36:04.276
Sir, I need you to calm down.
This will just take a minute.

36:05.413 --> 36:08.246
(rapid beeping)

36:08.291 --> 36:09.667
(receiver clicks)

36:10.460 --> 36:12.121
(lowered voice)
Uh, dispatch?

36:12.170 --> 36:16.083
What is she doing over there?
Who is she talking to?

36:16.132 --> 36:17.838
Mark 1519.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.921
(Gail) We have a 20
on EDP Daniel Baird.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.963
Armstrong,
between Dupont and Bloor.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.927
That's——That's our street.
That's where we live.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.884
(siren wails, car accelerates)

36:30.730 --> 36:31.845
I gotta go. I don't——

36:31.898 --> 36:33.399
I don't have a lot of time.
I need to finish it.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.147
Finish? Finish what, Daniel?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.024
(squelch) Uh, Officer Epstein?

36:37.070 --> 36:41.484
Subject is KTP——
51—50 with a 10—60. (squelch)

36:43.118 --> 36:44.449
(holster clanks) Daniel...

36:44.494 --> 36:46.780
I'm gonna need you to put
your hands above your head now.

36:46.830 --> 36:47.660
I gotta go.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.616
— I need to fix it.
— Whoa. Whoa!

36:48.665 --> 36:51.122
— Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Put the gun down!
— Whoa! Whoa! Put the gun down!

36:51.167 --> 36:53.032
(voice breaking) I need to fix it.
I need to fix it for her.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.121
— Put it down!
— Put... put it down!

36:54.170 --> 36:55.455
— I can really do it.
— Put the——

36:55.505 --> 36:56.540
I can really do it for her. Unh!

36:56.589 --> 36:59.672
(Gail) Stay down! Stay down!
Stay down!

36:59.718 --> 37:01.003
Noooooo!
(siren approaching)

37:01.052 --> 37:03.429
— I got him. We got him.
(clicks handcuffs)

37:03.471 --> 37:07.305
(Daniel raging, sobbing)

37:08.643 --> 37:11.134
(sighs) The guy had this.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.226
(Andy) Oh, my God.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.516
That's Luke's gun.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.899
(breathing hard)

37:30.457 --> 37:32.448
Luke!

37:32.500 --> 37:36.459
Luke! Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.540
Okay... It's me, Andy.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.921
He's down!

37:39.966 --> 37:41.752
Ohh.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.801
10—33. Officer down.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.802
926—A Armstrong.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.965
All right.
So, okay, he's breathing.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.849
Cloths. Get some cloths
from the kitchen.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.807
Cloths! Hey, McNally! Get some cloths
or towels or whatever...

37:54.856 --> 37:56.721
— (gasping) Okay. Okay.
— from the kitchen, all right?

37:56.775 --> 37:58.857
— (opens drawer, clatter)
— (Sam) He's still alive.

38:00.111 --> 38:04.445
10—33! Officer down, 926—A Armstrong!
We need a bus!

38:04.491 --> 38:06.197
All right. What do I do?
(hyperventilating)

38:06.242 --> 38:09.109
That's good. All right.
Just put——apply pressure there.

38:09.162 --> 38:11.198
That's it. Okay.
It's gonna be all right.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.327
— (voice breaks) Sam.
— Look at me, all right?

38:12.373 --> 38:13.874
(approaching sirens)
It's gonna be fine. He's still alive.

38:13.917 --> 38:15.248
Just stay with me, all right?

38:15.293 --> 38:17.375
(crying)

38:17.420 --> 38:19.206
(sirens wailing)

38:23.802 --> 38:26.134
(indistinct conversations)

38:26.179 --> 38:28.636
He's been in there
a really long time.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.468
He's in the best possible hands.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.474
(whispers) Yeah.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.976
Have you heard anything?

38:35.021 --> 38:36.477
Ohh.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.979
(sighs) No.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.265
We've got Daniel Baird sedated.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.400
Found this on him.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.395
Must've locked you up.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.360
Yeah, well, um...

38:48.409 --> 38:51.321
Luke put the house
in both of our names, so...

38:52.330 --> 38:53.570
How did he get in?

38:53.623 --> 38:55.614
Looks like he came in through
the back gate.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.783
— There was no lock, so...
— (sighs)

39:00.296 --> 39:01.376
(Frank) How is he?

39:01.422 --> 39:04.914
We got the bullets out,
but, uh, he lost a lot of blood.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.417
The next 48 hours are critical.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.459
Can I see him?

39:08.513 --> 39:10.003
Uh, look, l'm——l'm sorry.

39:10.056 --> 39:12.297
lCU is restricted.
Family only.

39:12.851 --> 39:16.014
l'm his fiancee.
I am his family.

39:17.313 --> 39:18.598
All right. Come on.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.659
(men speaking indistinctly)

39:36.708 --> 39:39.450
(door opens,
footsteps approach)

39:39.502 --> 39:41.208
— (man) Go away.
— (second man) Aah!

39:41.254 --> 39:44.041
— Sorry, boys.
— (men chuckle)

39:44.090 --> 39:45.500
You need this bathroom, too?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.965
| just want to see if you're okay.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.376
I'm fine.

39:50.430 --> 39:53.718
Dov... (sighs)
How did you know?

39:54.976 --> 39:56.591
l don't——| don't know.

39:57.687 --> 39:58.767
I just——

39:58.813 --> 40:01.600
Something seemed off,
so I dove in.

40:01.649 --> 40:04.356
It's the only way
I know how to do this job.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.610
(Sia's "I'm in Here" playing)

40:14.913 --> 40:16.244
I'm gonna be outside.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.366
J‘ I'm in here J‘

40:21.419 --> 40:22.784
(door opens)

40:22.837 --> 40:24.418
I spoke to my staff sergeant,

40:24.464 --> 40:26.921
and he said we could put out
another priority one bulletin

40:26.966 --> 40:27.955
on your daughter in the morning.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.499
Ohh. Thank you.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.133
I promise,
we won't forget about her.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.803
Then if you don't mind...

40:35.683 --> 40:36.968
can I go over it one more time?

40:37.018 --> 40:38.724
Go ahead.

40:39.979 --> 40:44.393
J‘ Can anybody help? J‘

40:44.442 --> 40:47.024
J‘ Ah, ah, ah J‘

40:47.070 --> 40:48.776
| just heard.

40:48.821 --> 40:52.313
J‘ Can you hear my call? J‘

40:52.367 --> 40:54.358
(sighs) Luke's out of surgery,
but they still don't know.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.325
I know.

40:56.371 --> 41:00.614
J‘ I've been waiting for you J‘

41:00.667 --> 41:02.453
(lowered voice)
So the eyewitness story was bogus?

41:02.502 --> 41:06.120
(lowered voice) She's just a mom trying
to do what she has to do for her kid.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.705
Doesn't always make sense.

41:09.884 --> 41:10.748
Sure it does.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.169
Family comes first.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.428
Can't argue with that.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.801
J‘ I'm crying out J‘

41:20.853 --> 41:22.514
Okay. I gotta go
to the hospital in a bit.

41:22.563 --> 41:26.147
You want me to, uh,
put a second pair of eyes on that?

41:26.192 --> 41:27.853
That'd be great.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.267
All right.

41:30.071 --> 41:33.529
J‘ Stuck inside these walls J‘

41:33.574 --> 41:36.702
J‘ Tell me there is hope J‘

41:36.744 --> 41:38.860
J‘ For meJ‘

41:40.206 --> 41:45.326
J‘ Is anybody out there listening? J‘

41:45.378 --> 41:48.836
J‘ Can you hear my call?

41:48.881 --> 41:52.339
J‘ Are you coming to get me now? J‘

41:52.385 --> 41:56.879
J‘ I've been waiting for J‘

41:56.931 --> 41:58.887
J‘ YOU to come rescue me J‘

41:58.933 --> 42:00.389
(monitor beeping steadily)

42:00.435 --> 42:03.848
J‘ I need you to hold J‘

42:03.896 --> 42:06.148
J‘ All of the sadness I cannot J‘

42:06.190 --> 42:08.476
(monitoring update beeps)

42:08.526 --> 42:09.686
(monitor beeping steadily)

42:09.736 --> 42:13.024
J‘ Live with inside of me J‘

42:13.072 --> 42:15.233
J‘ I'm in here J‘

42:19.912 --> 42:24.076
J‘ I'm in here J‘
