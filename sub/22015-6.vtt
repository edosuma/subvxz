00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.436
- In the criminal
justice system,

00:04.605 --> 00:06.407
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.609
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.642 --> 00:10.778
who investigate these vicious
felonies are members

00:10.811 --> 00:14.115
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.148 --> 00:17.118
These are their stories.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.287
[rock music]

00:19.320 --> 00:23.091
- * You can't break me down

00:23.124 --> 00:24.292
*

00:24.325 --> 00:29.130
* You can't pick me up

00:29.163 --> 00:34.635
* You can't leave me dying

00:34.668 --> 00:36.837
* When I'm out of luck

00:36.870 --> 00:39.807
- [screaming]

00:39.840 --> 00:41.175
Help!
Help!

00:41.209 --> 00:44.412
Help!
[screams]

00:44.445 --> 00:45.679
Mom, help!

00:45.713 --> 00:49.550
No!
Get off!

00:49.583 --> 00:54.155
[muffled screams]

00:56.724 --> 01:00.128
- Then Turtle decided
the hill wasn't so big

01:00.161 --> 01:03.764
and started into the sunrise.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.200
Okay.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.204
Good night, kiddo.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.478
You sleep tight.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.850
- Can I have Eddie,
just in case?

01:22.883 --> 01:24.585
- Yes.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.495
- This is Eddie.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.896
- Oh.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.599
Eddie the Elephant.
[laughs]

01:41.402 --> 01:44.238
Here you go.
Let's tuck him in, okay?

01:44.272 --> 01:46.207
- Good night, Eddie.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.775
- All right, sweetheart.

01:47.808 --> 01:51.345
I can't wait to learn about
all your favorite things.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.647
Sleep tight.
- Good night, grandma.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.458
- Do you like--
- So how long--

02:04.492 --> 02:06.394
Oh, sorry.
I interrupted.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.162
Go ahead.
- No, I'm sorry.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.364
You were saying?
- Are you enjoying New York?

02:10.398 --> 02:12.800
- It's interesting, I'm sure.
[phone vibrates]

02:12.833 --> 02:15.336
- Excuse me.
Benson.

02:17.238 --> 02:20.941
Okay.
Uh, all right.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.943
Yeah, I'll be right there.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.547
Okay.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.417
Sorry.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.919
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just a, uh...

02:31.952 --> 02:33.787
It's just a work thing.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.456
- Oh.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.258
Well, I'd--
I'd be happy to stay with Noah.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.727
- Uh, that's okay.
I'm already calling Lucy.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.195
Thank you, though.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.633
- I understand.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.369
- Rollins.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.803
- Thanks,
just as soon as you can.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.939
Yeah.
Dead teenage girl.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.674
Looks like an OD.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.809
- Heroin?
- That'd be a safe bet.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.211
We found this on her.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.413
No purse, no wallet,
no cell.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.382
- Was she raped?
- There's blood

03:01.415 --> 03:02.950
on her sweatpants,
and her face and arms

03:02.983 --> 03:04.352
speak for themselves.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.688
- Okay.

03:10.424 --> 03:14.262
Damn.
She looks like she's 15.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.837
[dramatic music]

03:23.871 --> 03:31.245
*

04:09.983 --> 04:11.852
with sexual assault,

04:11.885 --> 04:14.722
and the heroin that she shot up
with was laced with fentanyl.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.557
That's what killed her.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.326
- Well, a search of the nearby
trash didn't turn up her ID

04:18.359 --> 04:20.060
or her cell.
- Fingerprints?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.829
- No, not in the system.
Neither was her DNA.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.997
- I assume nobody filed
a missing persons report.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.733
- Nothing that was close.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.401
- The saddest thing
in the world.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.471
A dead Jane Doe.
- Yeah.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.972
- So she didn't have the cash.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.841
How did she pay
for these drugs?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.809
- A young girl like that's got
a lot more to offer than cash.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.978
Or some enterprising
scumsucker swoops in

04:38.011 --> 04:39.447
while she's OD'ing
and robs her.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.316
- Before or after
he rapes her?

04:42.350 --> 04:44.718
You know who sells this?

04:44.752 --> 04:46.019
- Not yet.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.322
[dramatic music]

04:48.356 --> 04:49.790
I don't miss narcotics.
What is this?

04:49.823 --> 04:51.625
Some kind of narco holiday
I don't know about?

04:51.659 --> 04:53.927
- Yeah,
we call it Tuesday.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.465
OD's are off the charts.
My brother's a cop out in Ohio.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.467
They're running out of room
to store the bodies.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.902
Here it is.
- Billy Lucas.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.637
I never heard of him.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.773
- One of the young turks.
Made a name for himself

05:05.806 --> 05:08.776
selling high-quality heroin
and stamping it with a bolt.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.644
- What, 'cause it hits you
like a bolt of lightning?

05:10.678 --> 05:13.080
- Yeah.
And screws you up.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.648
- So where can I find Billy?

05:14.682 --> 05:17.551
- Rikers.
Since January of last year.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.689
- Look, that's not the same.
- Wouldn't be the first time

05:21.722 --> 05:23.123
someone counterfeited
a hot seller.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.658
- So, where was Lucas dealing?

05:24.692 --> 05:26.560
- Harlem.
Where'd you find your vic?

05:26.594 --> 05:29.029
- Down in the East Village.
Who's selling down there?

05:29.062 --> 05:32.600
- Uh, Benjamin West,
AKA Jinky.

05:32.633 --> 05:36.136
George Ruiz.
And Andre Johnson,

05:36.169 --> 05:37.871
AKA Hackapulco.

05:37.905 --> 05:41.409
- Cross-check these guys
with Lucas' known associates.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.815
Looks like I'm taking
a trip to Hackapulco.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.820
- What up, G?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.054
- That's him.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.156
Burgundy bomber,
black sweatpants.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.725
- Copy that.

05:58.826 --> 06:01.862
[indistinct chatter]

06:11.972 --> 06:15.075
- Don't leave till we get
to know each other.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.977
- Get your hands
on the car.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.747
Any needles?
No?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.722
What do we got here?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.824
- Nothing.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.960
Not like I'm Facebook friends
with everybody I meet.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.896
How about those who buy
the crap you're selling?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.465
- How about the ones you raped?

06:37.498 --> 06:40.167
- Oh, hell no.
You got the wrong bro.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.869
And that little bit
you got me with?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.837
[laughs]
Man, I'll be ordering lunch

06:43.871 --> 06:45.439
from my favorite
gyro cart tomorrow.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.874
- Yeah?
Well, unless they change

06:46.907 --> 06:48.676
the penalty for rape,
you'll have to tell them

06:48.709 --> 06:50.077
you'll pick it up
in about 25 years, all right?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.945
- There's no way
I raped that ho.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.948
- Okay, so, tell them it'll
only be about three to fifteen.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.751
Because whatever was in
that crap you gave her,

06:57.785 --> 06:59.186
it killed her.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.490
- Look, I never sold
to the bitch.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.757
- Bitch?
Okay, are you trying

07:03.791 --> 07:05.659
to go to jail?
- All right,

07:05.693 --> 07:07.995
I never sold to the young lady.
- But you knew her.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.466
- She was with a dude
I did business with.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.901
Some white dude.
Had a weird

07:13.934 --> 07:17.805
white boy 'stache.
So, what now?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.745
Yeah, that's the dude.
You see?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.515
I'm a good citizen,
helping you out and all.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.182
So I can go now.
- While we appreciate

07:29.216 --> 07:32.252
how devastated you are that
your drugs are killing people,

07:32.285 --> 07:33.887
no.
No, you can't go.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.524
- Who's she?
- I'm the bitch

07:36.557 --> 07:37.858
that's gonna smack
your pretty face

07:37.891 --> 07:41.228
the next time
I hear you say, "ho."

07:41.261 --> 07:43.263
Swab him.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.799
Find Mr. 'Stache.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.570
- Oh, you're looking good,
Tommy,

07:49.603 --> 07:51.038
especially after such
a rough night.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.906
- Yeah, OD'ing can be
pretty hard on a body.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.009
Nothing like a shot of Narcan
to fix that, huh?

07:56.043 --> 07:57.611
Whoa.

07:57.645 --> 07:58.879
Just so you know,

07:58.912 --> 08:00.948
that girl you were
with last night,

08:00.981 --> 08:02.683
she wasn't that lucky.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.887
- Natalie.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.122
Is she okay?
- Actually, she's not.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.759
What went on last night?

08:11.792 --> 08:14.027
- I hadn't seen her in,
like, forever.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.563
And then she just showed up
here before closing.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.964
- How'd she seem?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.999
- Fine.
She just wanted to celebrate.

08:19.032 --> 08:22.035
- Did you celebrate
by sleeping with her?

08:22.069 --> 08:24.705
- Look, man.
I-I had a date.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.874
- So you left Natalie alone
to shoot up by herself?

08:26.907 --> 08:29.042
- Look, like I said,
I had someplace to be.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.578
- Natalie have a last name?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.012
- Look, I just know her
as Natalie.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.583
Okay, wait, no--
I know where she lives.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.685
- You don't know her last name,
but you know where she lives?

08:37.718 --> 08:42.055
We once had to...borrow
some of her parents'...stuff.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.160
- They're the police.
- What's going on?

08:47.194 --> 08:50.664
- How old is your daughter?
- Uh, Natalie's fifteen.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.999
Why?
- When--when is the last time

08:52.032 --> 08:53.200
you saw her?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.002
- Three, maybe four months ago.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.137
- Why didn't you file
a missing person's report?

08:57.170 --> 09:00.073
- Because she's not missing.
Uh, she's in rehab.

09:09.316 --> 09:09.850
.

09:09.883 --> 09:10.584
- Last thing she said
to me was,

09:11.719 --> 09:13.086
"I hate you."

09:13.120 --> 09:15.222
- They told us
to give her space.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.090
That when she got stronger--

09:17.124 --> 09:19.860
- I'm sure that you both did
everything that you could have

09:19.893 --> 09:21.995
to help her.
- Did we?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.998
She broke her ankle
playing soccer,

09:25.032 --> 09:26.800
and after the surgery,
they sent her home

09:26.834 --> 09:28.268
with oxycontin.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.839
She kept saying it hurt.
So they'd prescribe more.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.373
- The damn doctors
did this to her.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.276
- After they cut her off,
she moved on to heroin.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.114
- I'm so sorry.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.358
- You have kids?
- I have a son.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.064
- Hold him close.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.938
- I'm gonna--
I'm gonna open the blinds.

10:06.774 --> 10:07.875
- Maybe you should go outside.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.077
- No.
No, I'm her mom.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.279
I was there when she was born.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.849
It's what parents do.
We are in for all of it.

10:29.930 --> 10:35.435
- [gasps]
- [sobbing]

10:35.468 --> 10:38.138
- Jesus.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.341
- [sobbing]

10:50.751 --> 10:54.221
- Lux isn't short for "luxury."
It's Latin for "light."

10:54.254 --> 10:56.389
We help young women who are
toiling in the darkness

10:56.423 --> 10:58.926
to emerge into the sunlight.
- That's beautiful.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.028
Are you missing
one of those young women?

11:01.061 --> 11:02.930
- Natalie Curtis.
- Why didn't you file

11:02.963 --> 11:04.431
a missing persons report?

11:04.464 --> 11:06.266
- If you know someone
who will actually listen,

11:06.299 --> 11:09.202
by all means,
leave his number.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.205
We're a treatment facility
for troubled girls.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.942
We have runaways
four or five times a month.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.343
- So, you don't report them?

11:16.376 --> 11:18.445
- Officers stopped responding
years ago.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.714
Unless she's under 13,
the report goes into

11:20.748 --> 11:23.817
a stack of paper that collects
dust until someone sweeps it up

11:23.851 --> 11:25.786
and shovels it into
a long-term storage.

11:25.819 --> 11:26.987
- Why didn't you
call her parents?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.488
I assume they're
footing the bill.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.490
- Most of the girls realize
they have no place to go

11:30.523 --> 11:33.961
or any money to get them there,
and come back in 48 hours.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.029
- Natalie ever run before?
- No.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.431
- How did she get out of here?
- This isn't a prison.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.268
I made that mistake when
I first started this place.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.970
The security measures made
the girls feel like

11:43.003 --> 11:44.805
they were being punished.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.807
Now the girls are secured
until they get over the hump.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.742
And then they're on their own
within the structure,

11:48.776 --> 11:50.210
certainly.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.179
Our cameras caught Natalie
slipping out

11:52.212 --> 11:54.748
when staff was dealing
with an incoming client.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.049
- Okay, we're gonna
need that video.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.384
- Of course.
I assume you're here

11:57.417 --> 11:58.952
because you found her.
Is she all right?

11:58.986 --> 12:01.922
- No, she's not.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.292
- Overdose?
- Damn it,

12:05.325 --> 12:07.861
get your hands
off of me.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.362
- This way.
- [screams]

12:09.396 --> 12:14.001
Do not send your kids here.
- Kristi, calm down.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.870
- Herr Doctor.
- Okay, take it easy.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.471
Stop fighting.
Come on, come on.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.108
- Hands!
- Down.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.413
That's Kristi,
our newest arrival.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.115
She's only been here
a couple of days.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.783
Typically it takes
a couple of weeks

12:29.817 --> 12:31.351
to realize we're not the enemy.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.987
- Okay, did Natalie--Did she
ever have any visitors?

12:34.021 --> 12:36.123
- Other than her parents
during her first weeks here.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.558
Oh, please.
Send them my sympathy,

12:38.591 --> 12:42.029
would you?

12:42.062 --> 12:44.297
- Walk with me.
- Did anybody pick up Natalie

12:44.331 --> 12:46.900
outside?
- We have exterior cameras.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.568
You're welcome to those, too.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.905
Rosemary.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.373
- Rosemary Taylor,
our social worker

12:53.406 --> 12:55.909
and den mom.
These are NYPD detectives.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.111
Help them with
whatever they need.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.412
If you'll excuse me.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.315
- We're here
about Natalie Curtis.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.452
- Damn it.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.821
Sometimes it feels
like we're fighting a war

13:07.855 --> 13:10.523
that we just can't win.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.593
My aide waved the white flag
a few months back.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.064
If you know of anyone
who wants to see the worst

13:17.097 --> 13:18.465
humanity has to offer--

13:18.498 --> 13:20.600
- We've seen our share.
- Forgive me.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.069
I'm on my feet all day.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.470
- What can you tell us
about Natalie?

13:23.503 --> 13:29.142
- She is--was--uh...
Extraordinary.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.078
Her paintings
were like poetry.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.579
- But she didn't care much
for this place?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.481
- Not at first, no.
But she settled in.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.083
I actually thought
that she would be

13:36.116 --> 13:37.484
one of our success stories.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.552
But one thing I've learned
about addicts.

13:39.586 --> 13:43.290
They, uh--they lie to you
with a smile.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.893
- Ms. Taylor, um,
Natalie overdosed

13:45.926 --> 13:47.327
in the East Village.
- Hmm.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.162
- Wondering if she talked
to you about anybody

13:49.196 --> 13:50.563
she used to do drugs with.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.600
- Uh, I'm sorry.
I-I would love to help you,

13:53.633 --> 13:57.604
but we have a strict
confidentiality policy.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.540
I'm--I'm sure you understand.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.512
- Place felt like
if you walked in there

14:05.545 --> 14:07.447
with dirt on your shoes,
somebody would come

14:07.480 --> 14:10.884
up behind you with a broom
and a dust pan.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.921
Liv?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.289
Liv?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.592
- Sorry.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.262
Um, did we check with ViCAP?

14:22.295 --> 14:24.965
Uh, does the rape
fit a pattern?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.266
- Yeah, we checked,
but there's nothing.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.936
So, a teenage girl
breaks out of rehab,

14:28.969 --> 14:30.537
goes to the city,
gets high,

14:30.570 --> 14:33.673
she zonks out,
some guy passing by sees her.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.375
It's a needle
in a haystack.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.311
- How did she get from Lux
to the East Village?

14:38.345 --> 14:40.981
- I'll get the footage from
the trains, buses, and subways.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.415
- I'll check the security cams
around Lux.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.384
- Okay.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.187
- Hey.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.222
You doing all right?

14:49.256 --> 14:51.091
- Yeah.
You know, this, uh,

14:51.124 --> 14:54.561
this case just brings back...

14:54.594 --> 14:56.029
- Ellie.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.564
- I gotta get over it,
right?

14:57.597 --> 14:59.632
[phone vibrates]

14:59.666 --> 15:02.069
- Uh, Rollins.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.608
Okay, thanks.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.310
How long was Natalie
at Lux?

15:10.343 --> 15:12.412
- Um, six months.
Why?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.447
- Because she was
two months pregnant.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.416
And the DNA
from the paternity test

15:16.449 --> 15:19.086
matches the DNA
from the rape kit.

15:25.658 --> 15:25.993
.

15:26.026 --> 15:26.659
- Did Natalie have a boyfriend?

15:28.095 --> 15:29.196
- Life she led,
I assume she had many.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.497
- Jeez.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.067
- You think a friend
gave her the drugs?

15:34.101 --> 15:39.106
- Uh, there's actually
something else, Mrs. Curtis.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.573
I'm so sorry to tell you this,

15:40.607 --> 15:45.212
but Natalie was
two months pregnant.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.479
- Oh, my God.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.449
- No, that's not possible.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.551
Two months ago,
she was at Lux.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.426
It was supposed to be
the best facility in the state.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.395
- No.
No, all of the patients there

16:02.429 --> 16:04.731
are girls.
- Damn it, Sarah.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.700
One of those damn saviors
took advantage of her.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.137
And we paid them
a fortune to do it.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.375
- It's possible
that Natalie confided

16:15.408 --> 16:18.111
in one of the therapists
there at Lux.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.648
So in order for us
to access her records,

16:21.681 --> 16:24.517
we would need your permission.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.986
- Yeah, sure.
Anything.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.656
- I'm so sorry.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.492
- Those are warrants
for DNA samples

16:32.525 --> 16:34.161
of all your male employees.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.463
- I don't understand.
You saw the video.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.298
Natalie left on her own.
- The thing is,

16:38.331 --> 16:39.632
she was carrying
more than a jones.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.034
- She was pregnant.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.104
- And you think
it was someone here?

16:44.137 --> 16:46.273
I've spent a decade
building Lux.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.707
No detail was too small.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.442
There's no way whatever
happened, happened here.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.811
- You told us she didn't
have any visitors.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.314
- Everyone who works at Lux
is highly recommended.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.684
- Okay, so why don't we let
science eliminate them, then?

16:57.717 --> 17:00.253
- Sure.
- We need Natalie's files.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.655
- Now, that's a problem.
- We've got her parents' waiver

17:02.689 --> 17:04.624
of confidentiality.
- No, it's not that.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.593
Because Natalie's no longer
a current resident,

17:06.626 --> 17:10.430
her file is stored off-site.
- Wow, that was--

17:10.463 --> 17:11.764
That was quick.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.433
- There's a waiting list
to get in here.

17:13.466 --> 17:14.567
- It's good for you.
Not so good

17:14.601 --> 17:16.069
for the rest of the world.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.470
- While we're here,
we'd like to talk

17:17.504 --> 17:18.838
to some of your
other residents.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.573
- They're already dealing
with a lot.

17:20.607 --> 17:24.311
- We'll tread gently.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.079
- All right.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.518
- If my parents hadn't put me
in here a year ago,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.586
I'd be dead.
- Did you know Natalie?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.622
- Yeah.
Nothing worked with her.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.458
- How do you mean?
- Yoga, therapy--

17:38.491 --> 17:40.193
She hated it all.
- Hmm.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.462
- How long have you been here?
- Actual time,

17:42.495 --> 17:44.097
or what it feels like?

17:44.131 --> 17:45.465
- Actual time.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.234
- I don't know.
A few days.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.736
- And how are things?
- How do you think?

17:49.769 --> 17:51.604
My parents had me kidnapped
and brought here

17:51.638 --> 17:53.873
in the middle of the night.
- Okay.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.543
Have you ever been alone
with a male employee?

17:56.576 --> 17:59.212
- Does that turn you on,
Detective?

17:59.246 --> 18:02.515
- Stop it, Kristi.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.486
- No, I haven't been alone
with any of the men.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.488
- What do you know
about Natalie Curtis?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.757
- The girl who broke out?
- Yeah.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.660
- That she's lucky
she's not here.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.534
- That's a hell of
a welcoming committee.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.875
- There.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.347
- And the external camera
caught this.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.688
There's no defensive wounds
with no marks on her face.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.523
- So she was raped
after she left Lux.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.558
- Yeah.
- And I checked with Uber,

18:45.592 --> 18:47.727
Lyft, nothing.
The local cab companies

18:47.760 --> 18:50.663
have no record of any pick ups
anywhere near the facility.

18:50.697 --> 18:54.834
So--
[phone vibrates]

18:54.867 --> 18:56.903
- Benson.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.872
Uh-huh.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.410
Uh...

19:03.443 --> 19:05.678
Sure, um,
yeah.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.948
Just--just give me
a few minutes.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.419
Okay.
I'll be right back.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.753
Sheila.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.689
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.959
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.

19:19.992 --> 19:20.960
- Cappuccino, right?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.196
- [laughs]
Thank you.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.164
Thank you,
that's very nice.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.871
- Oh, um, here.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.244
- Um--
- It was Ellie's.

19:38.911 --> 19:42.582
She was a tomboy, really.
She loved playing catch

19:42.615 --> 19:44.951
with her dad.

19:44.984 --> 19:48.688
- Oh.
- I thought Noah might like it.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.224
- Wow, thank you.
That's incredible.

19:51.258 --> 19:56.296
I haven't actually told Noah
about--about Ellie yet.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.933
But--but thank you.
- Of course you haven't.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.769
- You know,
I'm sure he's gonna love it.

20:02.802 --> 20:06.273
[laughs]
- Yeah, she did.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.578
Do you--

20:11.611 --> 20:14.814
Do you mind if I...

20:14.847 --> 20:17.284
ask you something?

20:17.317 --> 20:18.385
- Of course.

20:23.590 --> 20:28.695
- Did Ellie...ever say
anything about me?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.764
Other than I was dead?

20:31.798 --> 20:34.801
- You know,
when people are struggling

20:34.834 --> 20:36.603
with addiction,
they say things

20:36.636 --> 20:37.904
that they don't mean.
She didn't--

20:37.937 --> 20:40.273
She didn't mean that.
- No, it's okay.

20:40.307 --> 20:46.045
You know, things weren't
always bad between us.

20:46.078 --> 20:50.917
I used to read to her every
night when she was little.

20:50.950 --> 20:55.054
"Tate the Turtle."
That was her favorite.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.791
- Noah's favorite book is,
uh, "Barnyard Dance."

20:58.825 --> 21:01.961
- Oh, they both like animals.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.433
She used to talk about
becoming a veterinarian.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.638
She'd gossip with me
about boys in her class.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.006
She never did like
the cheerleaders.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.942
[laughs]

21:15.975 --> 21:20.480
- Sheila, you don't
have to do this.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.483
You don't--you don't have
to prove to me that--

21:23.516 --> 21:24.951
that you were a good mother.

21:24.984 --> 21:28.087
- Yes, I do.
I know what people think

21:28.120 --> 21:29.722
when they see me.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.792
"What kind of mother was she?

21:32.825 --> 21:35.762
She let her daughter
become a junkie."

21:37.964 --> 21:42.068
But I tried.
Olivia, I tried.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.708
- You know, I know that
it's not a comfort,

21:48.741 --> 21:53.380
but, um,
I've seen this a lot.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.450
It can happen to anyone.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.885
- Even you?

22:01.954 --> 22:06.393
- I don't think that--
- I didn't, either.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.997
One minute, we're shopping
for prom dresses.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.132
And the next,
she's coming at me

22:13.165 --> 22:14.467
with a steak knife.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.536
- That wasn't Ellie, Sheila.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.339
Ellie was long gone by then.

22:26.946 --> 22:32.084
- I-I just wish--
I just wish that she had met

22:32.118 --> 22:37.424
someone like you...
earlier, before.

22:37.457 --> 22:41.494
I just want Noah to know
how much I love him.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.175
- Hey.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.177
- How is Sheila?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.779
- What?

22:59.812 --> 23:01.448
- I'm a detective.
You come in with a kid's

23:01.481 --> 23:04.484
old baseball glove.
- Oh.

23:04.517 --> 23:10.056
Rollins, do you think that I'm
too quick to judge people?

23:10.089 --> 23:12.124
- Hey, when someone butts
into your life like she did--

23:12.158 --> 23:14.961
- Well, turns out that
she's not the witch

23:14.994 --> 23:17.564
that I wanted her to be.

23:19.766 --> 23:24.437
- Um, none of the DNA from
the male workers at Lux

23:24.471 --> 23:27.874
matched the DNA from Natalie's
paternity or rape kit.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.009
I mean, there was only one
virgin birth, right?

23:30.042 --> 23:31.478
- You can't improve
on perfection, Rollins.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.945
Okay.
Here's what we got.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.482
Now, before Natalie
met Tom Higgins,

23:35.515 --> 23:37.083
she got off the L train
at 1st Avenue.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.851
- Hold on.
Lux is in Bronxville.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.219
What the hell was she
doing in Brooklyn?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.054
- Unfortunately,
there's no footage of her

23:42.088 --> 23:44.223
getting on the subway.
- Blow that up, will you?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.158
Look at that.
That's interesting.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.094
There's the bruising
on her face.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.762
- That means that she was raped
after she left Lux

23:49.796 --> 23:51.531
but before she shot up.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.833
- But her rapist impregnated
her while she was at Lux,

23:53.866 --> 23:55.702
so something is not right.

23:55.735 --> 23:58.771
- Lux isn't as squeaky clean
as the good doctor makes out.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.773
A civil suit was filed
against it four years ago.

24:00.807 --> 24:04.010
It settled out of court.
The plaintiff was Isla Danby.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.846
She lives in East Village.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.881
- There we go.
Talk to her.

24:13.085 --> 24:16.122
- Hello?
- We're almost done.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.825
I said we're almost done.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.760
Cuddling isn't illegal.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.994
- We just wanna talk.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.030
- Isla,
I paid for an hour.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.733
- I'll credit you a half
an hour next week.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.068
- People pay you
to cuddle with them?

24:29.101 --> 24:30.770
- It's a lonely city.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.705
You'd be surprised how many
people are desperate

24:32.739 --> 24:34.240
for human contact.

24:34.273 --> 24:37.176
What do you want?
- Lux Rehab.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.279
- Best rehab in the state.
Just ask them.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.148
- How long were you
in there for?

24:42.181 --> 24:45.051
- I did the whole tour.
A year with a two week

24:45.084 --> 24:47.153
side trip to Altbrook,
then right back to Lux

24:47.186 --> 24:50.256
with its tidy art rooms
and prison-like detox.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.924
- Well, it seems like you
kicked whatever habit

24:51.958 --> 24:54.160
you went in there for.
- Knock on wood.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.563
- So, why'd you sue Lux?

24:57.263 --> 24:59.599
- I mean, I'd like
to tell you that,

24:59.632 --> 25:01.634
but I can't.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.035
- Listen, a couple days ago,
a girl broke out

25:03.069 --> 25:04.637
and then she turned up dead.

25:04.671 --> 25:05.838
Now we think she might
have been raped

25:05.872 --> 25:09.542
while she was at Lux.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.010
- I signed a non-disclosure
agreement.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.845
They could take
my business away,

25:12.879 --> 25:16.215
my apartment.
I'm sorry.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.917
All I can say is,
I'm glad you're looking

25:17.950 --> 25:19.218
into those places.
[phone vibrates]

25:19.251 --> 25:20.953
- Carisi.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.254
What--No, no.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.657
We have a warrant
and a parental waiver.

25:26.325 --> 25:29.796
Lux is refusing to hand over
Natalie's records.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.097
- There's a shock.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.970
- What happened
to Natalie Curits

25:38.004 --> 25:39.972
is heartbreaking,
but her cause of death

25:40.006 --> 25:41.708
was a drug overdose
which occurred

25:41.741 --> 25:43.075
on the streets of Manhattan,

25:43.109 --> 25:44.811
not at Lux Residential
Treatment Center.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.345
There is no reason to move on--

25:46.378 --> 25:48.347
- We believe Natalie was raped
in the care of the defendant.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.717
- And my client turned over
everything it deemed relevant

25:50.750 --> 25:53.119
that wasn't protected by
doctor/patient confidentiality.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.054
- Her parents waived
any confidentiality.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.689
- They may be her parents,
but they are not

25:56.723 --> 25:59.225
her legal guardians
when it comes to Lux.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.894
This is the contract
Mr. and Mrs. Curtis signed

26:01.928 --> 26:02.895
when their daughter,
a minor,

26:02.929 --> 26:04.631
was admitted.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.365
As is standard with most
residential treatment centers,

26:06.398 --> 26:09.602
her parents transferred
their parental rights to Lux.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.272
- Death would void
that provision.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.341
- Not according
to that signed contract.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.877
- Private parties may
enter into contracts

26:17.910 --> 26:20.780
so long as they do not run
afoul of the principles

26:20.813 --> 26:24.016
of lack of capacity, duress,
undue influence,

26:24.050 --> 26:27.319
mistake, fraud,
or public policy,

26:27.353 --> 26:29.321
none of which is alleged
in the People's motion.

26:29.355 --> 26:32.191
Therefore, the People's request
for access to records

26:32.224 --> 26:35.061
relating to Natalie Curtis
is denied.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.900
- How do we appeal?
- We don't.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.170
Lux is bad.
There's 100 other

26:44.203 --> 26:46.005
vulnerable girls in there.
This isn't right.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.808
Sometimes on its way to "fair,"
the law misses "right".

26:48.841 --> 26:52.178
You wanna do something?
Figure out another way in.

26:58.851 --> 26:59.018
.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.219
- Opioids are the leading cause
of death in people under 50.

27:02.221 --> 27:06.192
In fact, opioid ODs have
shortened the life expectancy

27:06.225 --> 27:08.194
of Americans by 2 1/2 months.

27:08.227 --> 27:11.230
In the last year,
opioids killed more people

27:11.263 --> 27:12.999
than car crashes or guns.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.768
That's a tragedy,
but an even bigger one

27:15.802 --> 27:17.103
is that it's preventable.

27:19.772 --> 27:22.108
If I'd been carrying Narcan,
I might have saved

27:22.141 --> 27:26.045
this young lady.
My daughter.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.881
Thank you.

27:28.915 --> 27:31.784
[applause]

27:36.122 --> 27:37.890
- I'm sorry for your loss.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.959
- Ms. Butler?
Are you in the field?

27:39.992 --> 27:42.695
I don't remember
seeing you here.

27:42.729 --> 27:45.331
- Oh, well, um,
after--after Willie died,

27:45.364 --> 27:47.133
I knew I had to go
to social work.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.235
But after I got my license,
I got comfortable

27:49.268 --> 27:50.703
in a think tank,
you know?

27:50.737 --> 27:53.205
I'm--I'm considering
making a change.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.807
- Beware.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.108
You walk through the mud,
you get dirty.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.778
- Yeah, I know.
But at the end of the day,

27:58.811 --> 28:00.479
I wanna be able to point
to something and say

28:00.512 --> 28:02.381
that I made it a little better.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.251
- Maybe you should get
a firsthand look

28:05.284 --> 28:06.853
at what you'd be getting into.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.388
I've been looking for
an assistant at Lux.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.390
- I wouldn't want
to put you out.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.026
- Give it a try
for a day or two

28:14.060 --> 28:16.362
off the record,
and we'll see

28:16.395 --> 28:18.898
if you have the stomach for it.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.934
Okay.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.903
That's the tab
for the patient files.

28:23.936 --> 28:26.739
Oh, sometimes the software's
a little glitchy.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.841
[tapping]
There.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.010
- No!

28:31.043 --> 28:32.779
No!

28:32.812 --> 28:35.414
Kiss my ass, damn it.
I'm not gonna eat this puke!

28:35.447 --> 28:36.482
- Kristi,
you don't have

28:36.515 --> 28:38.017
to eat the oatmeal.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.786
But you--
- I won't eat anything.

28:39.819 --> 28:40.853
You don't think I know
what you're doing?

28:40.887 --> 28:42.088
I know what you're doing.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.757
No!
I have rights, damn it!

28:44.791 --> 28:47.026
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Screw you!

28:47.059 --> 28:49.028
[spits]

28:49.061 --> 28:50.462
Screw all of you!

28:51.798 --> 28:52.799
- It's okay.
You don't have

28:52.832 --> 28:54.066
to eat the oatmeal.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.501
What will you eat?
- How many times

28:55.534 --> 28:57.503
do I have to tell you?
I'm not hungry.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.405
- You're going through detox,
Kristi.

28:59.438 --> 29:00.907
Your body needs food.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.141
- Why can't you just
let me die?

29:02.174 --> 29:03.843
I hate my life.
- Listen to me.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.477
I know what a struggle it is.
Okay?

29:05.511 --> 29:07.046
But I promise you that soon

29:07.079 --> 29:08.314
you're gonna be
a whole new person.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.548
A different person, okay?

29:09.581 --> 29:12.819
So what about some toast?
- Hmm?

29:12.852 --> 29:15.521
- One slice of toast?
Come on.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.423
Please?
One toast.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.025
One slice.
And then you and I

29:19.058 --> 29:20.492
are gonna--
Okay.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.094
- Okay.
- You and I are gonna walk

29:22.128 --> 29:24.797
around the grounds,
and then we're gonna

29:24.831 --> 29:26.332
be outside and get
some fresh air.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.499
Won't that be good?

29:27.533 --> 29:29.401
Yeah, there you go.
Sit.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.237
Okay.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.541
Okay.
You're all right.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.977
I'll see you in a few minutes.
Okay?

29:38.577 --> 29:41.914
Good.
Thank you.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.516
- She spit in your face.
You didn't even blink.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.485
- I've had worse.
A lot of these girls

29:46.518 --> 29:48.220
are self medicating.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.957
ADHD, bipolar, depression,
and for the first time

29:50.990 --> 29:53.325
in their lives they don't have
drugs to numb the feelings.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.827
- Right.
- And Kristi,

29:54.861 --> 29:56.262
she's only been here
a couple days,

29:56.295 --> 29:59.198
so we don't even know
what her issues are.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.234
I'm, uh, I'm gonna
go wash my face.

30:02.268 --> 30:05.104
Could you print out the notes
from Kristi's therapy sessions?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.839
'Cause I wanna be prepared
when we talk.

30:06.873 --> 30:09.241
- Absolutely.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.981
[clears throat]

30:35.101 --> 30:36.568
- This is unbelievable.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.204
- There is something
going on there.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.440
- It's an illegal search.
- I know.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.142
- Do you know
who raped Natalie?

30:43.175 --> 30:44.911
- No, because her files
were transferred.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.445
- Don't tell me that
somebody else was raped.

30:46.478 --> 30:49.281
- Do the insurance
companies count?

30:49.315 --> 30:50.649
Look.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.552
This is Kristi Martin's
patient billing.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.621
It comes to over $100,000.

30:55.654 --> 30:57.656
- Yes,
private rehab is expensive.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.391
- Right, but that doesn't
include the cost

30:59.425 --> 31:01.260
of walking in the door.
This is just medical tests

31:01.293 --> 31:03.429
and procedures.
She's been in Lux

31:03.462 --> 31:05.164
for less than two weeks.

31:05.932 --> 31:09.001
$50,000 for
electroconvulsive therapy.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.502
- Which I know is bogus.
- Because?

31:10.536 --> 31:12.571
- Because at the time
of the supposed procedure,

31:12.604 --> 31:15.441
she was threatening the staff
with a dining room chair.

31:15.474 --> 31:18.177
These bills are bogus,
and the insurance companies

31:18.210 --> 31:20.612
will never know about it.
If they can lie about this,

31:20.646 --> 31:23.082
Lux can lie about anything.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.918
- Only, it's inadmissible.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.419
- [sighs]

31:27.453 --> 31:29.922
- Inevitable discovery.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.458
If we can prove that we would
have come up with this

31:32.491 --> 31:35.394
without your illegal search...

31:35.427 --> 31:38.965
What was the name of Rosemary's
assistant before you?

31:40.466 --> 31:41.934
- I put that all behind me.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.369
- Oh, yeah?
Why'd you leave?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.337
- 'Cause I like to smile
every now and then.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.073
That place...

31:47.106 --> 31:48.540
I don't know.
I'd rather work at a morgue.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.609
- I know it's tough there.
But what can you tell us

31:50.642 --> 31:52.311
about billing at Lux?

31:52.344 --> 31:54.446
Did you ever notice
anything strange?

31:54.480 --> 31:56.082
- Strange?
- Overbilling?

31:56.115 --> 31:57.616
Charging for tests
and procedures

31:57.649 --> 31:58.985
that were never done?

31:59.018 --> 32:00.252
- No.
Rosemary was about

32:00.286 --> 32:01.553
helping the girls.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.389
What Lux charged
wasn't her concern.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.557
- What can you tell us
about Natalie Curtis?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.126
- She was one of
our success stories.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.727
Last time I saw her,
she was on her way

32:08.760 --> 32:11.330
to the sober living house.

32:11.363 --> 32:14.000
She was a do-over.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.434
That's what we called the girls
who came back to Lux

32:15.467 --> 32:16.702
for a second or third go.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.104
- Where was she
coming back from?

32:18.137 --> 32:20.239
- Altbrook.
- Altbrook?

32:20.272 --> 32:23.475
- When was she at Altbrook?
- Two, maybe three months ago.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.111
Right before I gave notice.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.578
- Where is that?
- Greenpoint, Franklin Street.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.981
- Okay, that's Brooklyn.
- Thank you.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.687
- Welcome to Altbrook Palace.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.456
- Nice place.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.125
- Where do you live?
In a hole?

32:39.158 --> 32:40.726
What the hell?
It's one step

32:40.759 --> 32:42.528
before the real world.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.596
- So, uh...

32:44.630 --> 32:46.098
How long have you been here?

32:46.132 --> 32:48.700
- Going on four months.
Takes some of us

32:48.734 --> 32:50.502
a little longer to step back
into reality.

32:50.536 --> 32:53.139
- So you were here when
Natalie Curtis was here?

32:53.172 --> 32:55.274
- Natalie?
Yeah, yeah.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.644
She was less ready than I am.
If that's even possible.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.146
- You're saying she fell
off the wagon?

33:00.179 --> 33:02.281
- And landed with a splat.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.050
I felt sorry for her.
- How did she get

33:04.083 --> 33:05.084
drugs in here?
- It's not like

33:05.117 --> 33:06.352
we're in solitary.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.021
We leave every day for jobs,
whatever.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.257
Turns out there are a lot
of places to get in trouble

33:11.290 --> 33:12.658
in Brooklyn.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.726
- Hey, Debbie.
Debbie, hey.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.196
- Screw off.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.467
- Where's the counselor
in charge around here?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.435
- [moaning]

33:23.469 --> 33:24.770
- That would be him.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.811
- NYPD.
Get up, now.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.646
- Hey, honey,
are you okay?

33:34.680 --> 33:37.516
- I'm fine.
- How old are you?

33:37.549 --> 33:38.784
- I'm 16.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.253
- Didn't I say get up?

33:41.287 --> 33:43.089
- What'd I do?

33:43.122 --> 33:44.756
- It's called statutory rape,
Anthony.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.325
- What the hell are you
talking about?

33:46.358 --> 33:47.759
I'm 19, the girl's 16.
She consented.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.195
- [scoffs]

33:49.228 --> 33:50.796
- It's the Romeo
and Juliet law.

33:50.829 --> 33:51.797
- What are you, a lawyer?

33:51.830 --> 33:53.332
- I'm Romeo.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.201
- That girl would agree
to waterboarding

33:55.234 --> 33:58.337
if you offered her drugs.
- Paternity's back.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.206
Congratulations.
You're a winner.

34:00.239 --> 34:01.807
- Of what?
- Of a dead teenager

34:01.840 --> 34:03.575
and her two-month-old fetus.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.277
- You knocked up Natalie Curtis
when she was released

34:05.311 --> 34:06.845
to Altbrook.
- And then you raped her

34:06.878 --> 34:08.714
the night she died.
- I never raped anybody.

34:08.747 --> 34:11.217
- What do you call it when you
trade an addict drugs for sex?

34:11.250 --> 34:14.253
- It's not rape
when she's begging for it.

34:23.629 --> 34:23.762
.

34:23.795 --> 34:24.930
- I'm a medical professional.
I don't subject my patients

34:26.865 --> 34:28.467
to unnecessary tests.
- Kristi's insurance

34:28.500 --> 34:30.502
was billed for
electroconvulsive therapy.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.604
And Kristi doesn't remember--
- Maybe that's why

34:32.638 --> 34:35.507
she had ECT.
We pride ourselves

34:35.541 --> 34:37.776
on being the premiere treatment
facility in New York.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.711
I take accusations like that
very seriously.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.414
- Good, because that's
how we mean them.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.883
So we will be subpoenaing
your billing record.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.452
- And you'll see
that I run tests--

34:46.485 --> 34:48.420
- Dennis, you don't have
to say anything.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.256
- Let me talk.
So I run tests.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.790
The girls are never honest
about what they've

34:51.823 --> 34:55.361
been snorting or shooting,
so I test their blood

34:55.394 --> 34:57.729
and hair to make sure I can
help them detox properly.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.531
- Well, they really are
the perfect victims,

34:59.565 --> 35:01.167
aren't they?

35:01.200 --> 35:03.369
Girls struggling with
emotional problems,

35:03.402 --> 35:05.537
mental illness,
chemical addiction.

35:05.571 --> 35:10.409
Desperate parents willing
to pay just about anything

35:10.442 --> 35:13.179
to keep their babies alive.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.914
And if you're
actually successful,

35:15.947 --> 35:20.786
then your colleagues at
Altbrook get them high again.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.721
And then they ship them
back to you,

35:22.754 --> 35:26.658
and you can just start this
process all over again.

35:26.692 --> 35:30.229
- I have no idea what happens
at the sober living home.

35:30.262 --> 35:33.599
- Really?
Because I do.

35:33.632 --> 35:37.436
Ten girls in the last 12 months
have come back to you, Doctor.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.905
What did you think
was going on?

35:39.938 --> 35:43.642
You're preying
on vulnerable kids.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.178
But what the hell.
You made a lot of money, right?

35:46.212 --> 35:48.747
You got rich.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.916
You're a venal predator.

35:50.949 --> 35:53.519
And we're gonna prove it
in court.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.522
- Is that right?

35:56.555 --> 35:58.757
What's that trial
gonna look like?

35:58.790 --> 36:00.526
"Call your first witness,
counselor."

36:00.559 --> 36:01.827
"Oh, you can't put her
on the stand.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.529
"She's mentally unstable.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.697
"Your second witness,
she's no good, either.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.399
She's a junkie."

36:07.433 --> 36:09.601
Next, a liar.

36:09.635 --> 36:12.838
After that,
a thief.

36:16.275 --> 36:20.812
And for the big finale--
drumroll, please.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.450
A 15-year-old slut who trades
her body for drugs.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.719
What jury's gonna believe
anything that comes out

36:27.753 --> 36:28.787
of their mouths?

36:37.996 --> 36:39.698
- Tell me you found something
on Anthony.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.467
- Not a thing.
He's within four years

36:41.500 --> 36:43.269
of every girl he's slept with
at Altbrook.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.737
- So much for a rape charge.
- How is it consent

36:45.771 --> 36:48.840
when you're extorting sex from
a 15-year-old drug addict?

36:48.874 --> 36:53.412
- That is a question that the
legal arena has yet to answer.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.447
Good idea for a law review
article, though.

36:55.481 --> 36:58.584
You should give Carisi a couple
of months off.

36:58.617 --> 36:59.851
What are you,
a bat?

36:59.885 --> 37:01.453
- What?

37:01.487 --> 37:02.988
Anyway, I talked to everybody
I could find

37:03.021 --> 37:04.790
who spent time at Altbrook
in the past six months.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.493
Now, all of them denied
receiving anything

37:07.526 --> 37:08.860
in exchange for sex.

37:08.894 --> 37:12.498
- So we can't get Anthony
on rape, dealing,

37:12.531 --> 37:14.433
child endangerment,
or contributing

37:14.466 --> 37:16.335
to the delinquency of a minor.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.737
- They're recycling these girls
like they were empty Coke cans.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.706
Come on, counselor.
Pull one of those rabbits

37:20.739 --> 37:22.608
out of your hat.
- I could--

37:22.641 --> 37:25.043
I could, if we can establish
a connection between Lux

37:25.076 --> 37:26.578
and Altbrook.
- We checked

37:26.612 --> 37:28.347
the corporate records.
There's nothing.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.783
- No, when Carisi and I
interviewed the cuddle girl

37:31.817 --> 37:34.586
about her Lux lawsuit,
she said--

37:34.620 --> 37:36.888
she said that she was glad
that somebody was finally

37:36.922 --> 37:39.758
checking into those places.
I mean, plural.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.560
So she could have been talking
about Altbrook.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.495
- Somebody at Lux
must have a soul.

37:43.529 --> 37:44.996
- Yeah, there's one I know of.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.667
- I can't--I can't believe
you're a cop.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.869
- I know, but I had to figure
out what happened to Natalie.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.671
Right?
She deserves that much, right?

37:52.704 --> 37:54.373
- We didn't have anything
to do with her death.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.742
- Okay, when she came
back to Lux

37:56.775 --> 37:58.644
after her stint at Altbrook--

37:58.677 --> 38:00.912
- If your partner had paid
attention to my lecture,

38:00.946 --> 38:02.781
you would both know
that opioids have

38:02.814 --> 38:06.652
an 80% relapse rate.
- Especially when one

38:06.685 --> 38:08.854
of the counselors
is handing her pills.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.892
- No.
I don't--I don't believe that.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.528
- Rosemary, the fact is,
not everybody is sorry

38:16.562 --> 38:19.898
for your loss.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.933
- [sighs]

38:23.835 --> 38:25.671
My Annie...

38:26.972 --> 38:29.808
She fought tooth and nail
to get clean.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.844
But it was like
climbing a wall of ice.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.917
I remember people in my
building looking at me like,

38:38.950 --> 38:41.487
"How could you let that
happen to your own kid?"

38:45.591 --> 38:47.659
[sighs]

38:49.461 --> 38:52.097
Only the devil...

38:52.130 --> 38:55.967
Would offer drugs to girls
right out of rehab.

38:56.001 --> 39:01.640
- We think that Dr. Barkley
is connected to Altbrook.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.575
- I don't think so.
I mean,

39:03.609 --> 39:05.744
Altbrook was just one
of the sober houses

39:05.777 --> 39:08.947
that we recommended.
- Did anybody from Altbrook

39:08.980 --> 39:11.583
ever visit Dr. Barkley?

39:11.617 --> 39:13.585
- Only when they came
to pick up the girls

39:13.619 --> 39:14.886
to take them to Brooklyn.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.532
- That's it, our connection
between Altbrook and Lux.

39:26.565 --> 39:27.999
Anthony Parker.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.735
- Yeah, now we can finally
nail that bastard.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.537
- Barkley is the one
that put him in charge.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.038
- Lucky for him,
sober homes aren't regulated.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.974
- You're looking at $40 million
gross billing last year.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.043
- Obamacare classifies
addiction

39:38.076 --> 39:41.046
as an essential service
so millions more got coverage.

39:41.079 --> 39:46.585
Dr. Barkley stepped right in.
Quadrupled his billing.

39:46.618 --> 39:47.853
Barkley's about to face

39:47.886 --> 39:49.855
an unintended consequence
of his own:

39:49.888 --> 39:51.557
the New York State RICO
statute.

39:51.590 --> 39:52.758
-Racketeering?

39:52.791 --> 39:54.660
- Drug dealing.
Rape.

39:54.693 --> 39:57.195
Insurance fraud.
It sounds like a racket to me.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.430
[phone vibrating]
- Hmm.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.666
Yeah, Rollins.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.570
Sure, Rosemary.

40:04.603 --> 40:08.173
30 minutes, okay?

40:08.206 --> 40:09.875
Something's not right.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.682
Rosemary.
- Hello, Amanda.

40:18.484 --> 40:20.952
- Oh, my--

40:22.153 --> 40:23.154
- He's OD'ing.

40:23.188 --> 40:24.990
- Ironic, isn't it?

40:25.023 --> 40:26.892
- My God.
- This is Detective Carisi

40:26.925 --> 40:29.127
of the NYPD.
- This is the promised end.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.662
- I need a bus at 100 Prescott
Avenue in Bronxville.

40:30.696 --> 40:32.163
There's Narcan in the car.

40:32.197 --> 40:36.735
- He stole lives.
He destroyed people's families.

40:36.768 --> 40:40.606
Natalie's, God knows
how many others.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.075
It's fentanyl.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.082
All the Narcan in the world
won't save him.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.593
- [groans]

41:03.729 --> 41:05.597
- You can arrest me now.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.117
- Watch out,
Aaron Judge.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.621
- He plays outfield.
I play infield.

41:29.655 --> 41:32.023
- Not till you finish
your breakfast.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.491
[doorbell rings]

41:34.059 --> 41:35.260
- It's Saturday.
How come you have

41:35.293 --> 41:36.795
to work today?

41:36.828 --> 41:38.530
- Honey, it's just for
a few hours.

41:38.564 --> 41:41.166
I promise, okay?
- Hmm.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.271
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:46.304 --> 41:49.174
- Hi!
- Come on in.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.843
- Hi.
[laughs]

41:56.982 --> 41:58.750
- This town,
a good babysitter

41:58.784 --> 42:00.018
is hard to come by.

42:01.687 --> 42:04.990
- Grandma.

42:20.839 --> 42:21.006
.

42:21.039 --> 42:21.472
[dramatic music]

42:23.775 --> 42:30.949
*

42:49.635 --> 42:52.838
[wolf howling]
