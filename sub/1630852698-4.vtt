ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE IN KOREA

00:14.764 --> 00:15.849
Hello.

00:15.932 --> 00:19.102
This is Orangibberish,
who gets to the truth behind rumors.

00:19.185 --> 00:22.605
Today, I'll be uncovering the truth
behind the Hyosan zombie rumor.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.233
I'm on my way to see
if it really turned into Zombieland

00:25.316 --> 00:28.194
as they say online and on social media.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.030
-FINALLY
-HE'S REALLY GOING

00:30.113 --> 00:32.198
Damn. It's insane here already.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.283
Look.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.578
-WHAT'S WITH THE TRAFFIC?
-WHY ARE YOU GOING TO HYOSAN, SON?

00:40.707 --> 00:41.791
Do you see this?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.626
It's bumper to bumper

00:43.710 --> 00:45.754
with cars trying to get into Hyosan.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.005
There are so many cars.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.966
Hold on.
I'll have to get out and hike my way in.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.470
I came up the mountain
to avoid the roadblock.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.472
See that down there?

00:56.181 --> 00:57.891
That there is Hyosan.

00:57.974 --> 01:02.437
Okay. Let me show you the equipment

01:02.520 --> 01:04.105
that I've brought.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.566
First. A helmet.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.569
A hockey mask. Knee and elbow pads.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.029
These are shin guards.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.448
This is emergency food.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.992
First aid kit. And water.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.286
And most important of all, an axe.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.789
If something grabs me,
I'll chop their necks, and…

01:20.872 --> 01:21.831
I'm all set.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.667
Please subscribe and like, okay?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.920
-MY MOM TOLD ME TO STAY HOME
-LOOK AT YOU ALL GEARED UP

01:27.003 --> 01:27.962
Hold on.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.547
-RUN FASTER!
-IS THAT REALLY A ZOMBIE?

01:29.631 --> 01:30.632
I'm fucked.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.426
Damn it. These crazy assholes.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.470
-RUN, BROTHER!
-DAMN

01:36.638 --> 01:38.473
-IT SHOULD BE OVER SOON
-THIS FOOTAGE WILL HELP US

01:39.808 --> 01:42.268
-LOOK AT THAT ACTING
-THIS IS FUN

01:42.352 --> 01:44.187
Are they gone? You saw that, right?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.647
-TAKE OUT YOUR AXE!
-WATCH OUT BEHIND YOU

01:45.730 --> 01:48.817
Fuck. These bastards are so fast.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.777
-SHOW US THE STREET
-COME BACK

01:56.074 --> 01:58.243
-I DON'T THINK I CAN SLEEP TONIGHT
-GOODBYE

01:58.326 --> 02:01.538
You saw that, right? Fuck.
Tell me you saw it, assholes.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.999
-SO DAMN SCARY
-JUST RUN AWAY

02:05.083 --> 02:06.960
-IT'S SCARY
-WHERE ARE THE REAL ZOMBIES?

02:07.710 --> 02:11.005
-ZOMBIELAND! AWESOME!
-IS THAT A REAL ZOMBIE?

02:11.089 --> 02:12.966
-YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN A GUN
-ZOMBIE!

03:12.358 --> 03:13.359
Are you okay?

03:15.987 --> 03:17.030
Your hand.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.120
You're not okay.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.547
Gyeong-su?

03:34.631 --> 03:36.216
Gyeong-su. It's you, isn't it?

03:36.299 --> 03:37.675
It's me.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.928
Cheong-san's mom.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.056
Gyeong-su. Where's Cheong-san?

03:44.807 --> 03:46.559
I'm sorry to say this…

03:50.647 --> 03:51.940
but be strong.

03:52.815 --> 03:53.775
Don't comfort me.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.195
You're not good at it.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.323
No, I am.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.662
Still, don't.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.668
I didn't know…

04:15.213 --> 04:17.131
I-sak was such a precious friend.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.345
Thinking that she's gone

04:23.930 --> 04:26.099
made me feel
like I had lost my whole world.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.105
Gyeong-su…

04:35.358 --> 04:37.110
must be out there somewhere.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.653
Yes.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.827
Gyeong-su!

04:46.828 --> 04:49.622
Gyeong-su. I'm Cheong-san's mom.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.340
Gyeong-su.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.931
Cheong-san…

05:28.286 --> 05:29.954
I wonder if things are okay outside.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.875
Your dad's a firefighter,
so I'm sure he's fine.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.754
My mom and dad
should be at the restaurant.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.008
That's the most important thing
for my mom.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.803
She might be serving chicken
to zombies right now.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.933
I wish I could have her chicken right now.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.104
-You said it was salty.
-But it still tasted good.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.401
Let's have some

06:02.612 --> 06:04.614
once this is all over
and we get out of here.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.035
I didn't hear anything.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.456
I couldn't hear anything.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.584
-Like what?
-After Na-yeon went out…

07:03.214 --> 07:05.049
and Ms. Park went out after her.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.053
Ms. Park!

07:09.554 --> 07:11.264
I didn't hear anything after that.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.224
You mean, screaming?

07:14.600 --> 07:15.601
Yes.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.356
Maybe they didn't die, then.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.068
They wouldn't have been quiet
if zombies were biting them.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.446
They must be alive.

07:34.662 --> 07:35.788
Why won't you respond?

07:36.831 --> 07:39.667
No one's responding.
I'm always talking to myself.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.044
-I think you're right.
-Forget it.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.422
I didn't hear anything either.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.715
Me neither.

07:46.632 --> 07:50.928
I was scared because I didn't know
how I'd feel if I heard them screaming,

07:51.554 --> 07:52.805
but I didn't hear anything.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.058
Come to think of it, neither did I.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.270
Then I'm right. They're alive, right?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.398
Should she be?

08:03.941 --> 08:04.942
What do you mean?

08:08.404 --> 08:09.530
She's a murderer.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.617
She killed Gyeong-su
and walked out on her own.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.579
Is it right for her to be alive?
Aren't you all being pretentious?

08:16.662 --> 08:17.747
What about Ms. Park?

08:18.956 --> 08:20.374
Should she have died too?

08:20.458 --> 08:21.709
Is that our fault?

08:21.792 --> 08:24.504
Regardless, it happened because of us.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.421
What?

08:26.839 --> 08:27.882
What did we do?

08:28.841 --> 08:31.177
Na-yeon killed someone
and played the victim

08:31.260 --> 08:32.553
and left on her own.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.807
Because we didn't listen to her?

08:38.017 --> 08:40.228
If no one's on your side,
is it okay to kill?

08:42.021 --> 08:44.273
Ms. Park talked
as if we were in the wrong.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.611
We didn't tell Na-yeon to go out there.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.282
We didn't tell Ms. Park
to go out there either.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.078
Why should we feel bad?

09:01.123 --> 09:03.000
Fuck. What the hell did we do wrong?

09:23.813 --> 09:24.647
Hey.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.192
I'm not sure if I should say this--

09:28.276 --> 09:29.485
Then don't say it.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.617
Doesn't anyone else
need to go to the bathroom?

09:45.459 --> 09:46.752
Is it just me?

09:49.130 --> 09:50.131
Me too.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.509
We have to go, too,

09:54.135 --> 09:55.136
but we can't go out.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.029
See?

10:14.655 --> 10:16.407
I told you no one would come.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.911
No one cares about this school.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.081
If they did,
they would've saved us sooner.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.709
Would've saved us from being bullied.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.861
I wish the school would burn down.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.823
So that nothing remains.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.992
They'll come and save us.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.999
They have to.

11:12.922 --> 11:13.964
Otherwise…

11:16.384 --> 11:17.343
I don't know.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.972
I hope a fire really does break out…

11:25.184 --> 11:26.727
and kills everyone.

11:28.854 --> 11:29.730
Right?

11:32.608 --> 11:34.026
You want to die too, right?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.201
No.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.954
I know you actually want to live.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.543
I know that you're…

11:53.337 --> 11:54.672
dying to live.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.721
Why are you blaming me?
Su-hyeok is the one who brought it up.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.931
It's not a crime to need to poop.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.101
It's not a crime, but…

12:07.184 --> 12:09.395
But what? Don't you need to go?

12:10.187 --> 12:11.647
Yes, I do.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.359
-But I don't need to poop.
-Cheong-san, what about you?

12:18.446 --> 12:20.364
I don't need to poop either.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.367
Don't you need to go?

12:23.451 --> 12:25.202
Why are you asking me?

12:25.786 --> 12:27.246
Why are you snapping at me?

12:27.329 --> 12:30.374
What are we supposed to do?
We can't go out anyway.

12:34.879 --> 12:35.838
I have a good idea.

12:40.801 --> 12:41.635
First,

12:42.762 --> 12:44.430
boys and girls will take turns.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.848
Where?

12:46.724 --> 12:47.808
Here.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.269
He's lost his mind.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.938
-Cut it out.
-Why?

12:53.022 --> 12:54.899
Girls can wait in there,

12:54.982 --> 12:57.109
and the guys can pee out the window.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.320
What about poop?

13:00.738 --> 13:01.781
Poop. Well,

13:02.490 --> 13:05.117
you can pull down your pants
and hang out the window.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.535
Like this.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.496
See? Outside.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.957
Like you're taking a dump
at the edge of a cliff.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.626
What reaction is he hoping for?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.044
Stop being ridiculous.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.838
But someone has to hold you or you'd fall.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.423
How will you wipe?

13:21.008 --> 13:23.260
-We can wipe each other.
-What is he saying?

13:23.344 --> 13:24.220
What a nutjob.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.472
Let's just hold it in.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.266
If the rescuers come--

13:29.350 --> 13:31.185
It'll take a while for them to come.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.606
It may be the same outside of the school.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.734
I don't know how long we'll be here,

13:38.818 --> 13:40.277
but my dad said

13:40.361 --> 13:44.198
you have to separate the bathroom from
where you sleep if you're ever isolated.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.700
Where can we make a bathroom and how?

13:47.701 --> 13:48.994
Over there.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.167
Yes, sir.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.711
They're sending a chopper.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.548
We have to get to the roof
by 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.091
Wait.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.678
Go up to the roof?
When the infected are everywhere?

14:05.761 --> 14:06.637
Also,

14:07.304 --> 14:10.599
tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.?
Not 11:00 p.m. tonight?

14:10.683 --> 14:13.352
Yes, tomorrow.
We'll have to spend the night here.

14:14.728 --> 14:18.357
How can she sleep here? Radio in again.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.777
We'll have to stay here tonight,
so we'll create a temporary bathroom.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.320
-U-sin.
-Yes, sir.

14:32.037 --> 14:35.416
Prez and you guys,
look for something to cover the window.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.333
Okay.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.335
Cheong-san and Joon-yeong,

14:38.961 --> 14:42.089
make something that can absorb urine
and feces to use as a toilet.

14:44.842 --> 14:45.843
Cheong-san.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.597
The rest of you…

14:49.680 --> 14:50.514
A screen?

14:50.598 --> 14:52.182
-A screen?
-To block the view.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.022
MUSIC 3

15:03.777 --> 15:04.778
Come with me.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.488
The bathroom is over there.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.671
Put this in here.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.383
Why don't we put this
on top of the basket?

15:26.467 --> 15:27.384
Oh, okay.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.555
Okay. We'll use this as a toilet

15:31.639 --> 15:33.557
as it will absorb urine and feces.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.395
Put this there too.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.608
Dae-su's butt is big, so let's…

15:43.901 --> 15:46.320
Why don't we tape CDs up there?

15:48.238 --> 15:49.782
-Tape.
-Is there more tape?

16:01.752 --> 16:04.964
Have they made the toilet yet?

16:05.047 --> 16:06.340
What's taking them so long?

16:09.969 --> 16:10.844
That's good.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.429
This should be good enough.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.600
How can we poop on this?

16:16.684 --> 16:19.728
Use the cover for poop
and remove it to pee.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.646
Get out.

16:20.729 --> 16:21.772
-Oh.
-Out.

16:21.855 --> 16:22.856
How do we use that?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.108
-Get out.
-Don't push me!

16:24.191 --> 16:25.317
Get out!

16:32.533 --> 16:35.452
At least there are cops
and soldiers out there.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.580
But in the movies,

16:39.415 --> 16:42.167
cops and soldiers are helpless too.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.337
Still, they always save people in the end.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.385
-Take the toilet paper.
-I need to pee.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.555
Damn it.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.557
Just stay inside.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.558
Does it smell?

16:58.976 --> 16:59.935
-Shit.
-What?

17:00.602 --> 17:03.063
Stop overreacting. It doesn't smell.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.898
Sit somewhere else.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.860
There's nobody out there.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.946
There are no lights on
in the stores and apartments.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.282
They all either fled or died.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.658
What are you saying?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.618
I'm saying no one will come to save us.

17:18.245 --> 17:20.497
Don't be so pessimistic.

17:20.581 --> 17:21.582
Don't you know my mom?

17:22.166 --> 17:25.586
She would've torn the school apart
looking for me, but she isn't here yet.

17:25.669 --> 17:26.795
What do you want to do?

17:27.963 --> 17:30.716
I'm just pointing out the facts.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.259
We all know no one's coming.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.304
Let's discuss what we're going to do.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.181
We have to wait to be rescued.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.225
We shouldn't leave safety
and go somewhere dangerous.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.144
What if no one ever comes?

17:44.229 --> 17:45.689
We haven't waited that long yet.

17:46.356 --> 17:49.693
Then how much longer?
Do you want to wait until we die?

17:49.777 --> 17:50.652
No.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.447
I'm saying let's wait
for as long as we can.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.824
We can't go out right now anyway.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.118
It's probably because it's nighttime.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.996
I'm sure somebody will come
in the morning.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.040
There are a lot of choppers flying around.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.460
Let's wait until morning.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.979
What are you saying?

18:26.063 --> 18:28.148
You'll leave first for a personal matter?

18:29.316 --> 18:32.194
How could a firefighter say that
during a disaster?

18:32.277 --> 18:36.031
I'll accept any punishment later.
I'll resign if that's what they want.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.908
Listen.

18:37.991 --> 18:41.120
You'll leave all these people
and go by yourself?

18:41.203 --> 18:44.498
You'll abandon your sick colleague
and leave a new kid in charge?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.042
Kid? He is not a kid.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.752
He's a firefighter.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.429
Fine. That was a slip of the tongue.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.766
My apologies if I offended you.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.894
But this isn't just about you.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.314
My daughter is at school,

19:11.024 --> 19:12.025
but I can't reach her.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.028
I know she's waiting for me.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.783
I need to go. I'm sorry.

19:19.867 --> 19:20.701
Wait.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.244
I want to tell you something.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.295
His home is right over there.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.340
If he says he needs to go save his mother,

19:36.049 --> 19:37.217
should I let him?

19:40.137 --> 19:42.014
She lives over there.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.558
She has a husband and children.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.895
Would it be right
to let her go if she wants?

19:50.439 --> 19:52.566
Knowing they'll all die if they go out?

19:56.445 --> 19:57.696
I have to go, even if I die.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.949
That's why I'm saying this.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.246
You're a firefighter.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.457
And I'm a politician.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.128
Do you know
when it's the hardest for people like us?

20:14.713 --> 20:15.881
Right now.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.176
Because we have to save the most people,

20:20.093 --> 20:22.346
not the people most precious to us.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.919
Fuck, that's perfect.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.089
I'll get away on that bike.

21:29.496 --> 21:30.914
Fuck!

22:37.731 --> 22:39.775
Damn it. Wash your hands.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.989
Do you know where the juniors are?

22:46.865 --> 22:47.949
I don't know.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.787
They're all zombies. It's not like
they'd stay with their classmates.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.707
Stop that. You're driving me crazy.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.170
It's dark out now, right?

23:00.253 --> 23:01.213
Let's go.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.841
Let's just leave tomorrow.

23:04.925 --> 23:09.137
It's too dark to see anything.
We won't see the zombies coming.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.099
You said we should go at night
so the zombies don't see us.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.268
People can change their minds.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.312
Shut it and stand up.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.356
No, I'm not going.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.482
Damn it.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.610
Forget it, then.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.946
Hey. Grab your bow and follow me.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.156
Shut up. Don't do anything.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.909
That bitch.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.537
Spoken like an athlete.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.374
-What?
-Doing nothing is your specialty.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.669
You do nothing but shoot arrows,
and you go to college and make money.

23:40.752 --> 23:44.589
You have an easy life,
so you sit on your fucking ass and wait.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.800
Who says shooting arrows
gets you into college?

23:46.883 --> 23:47.926
Doesn't it?

23:48.009 --> 23:50.095
Stop making it obvious
you're stupid and stay down.

23:50.178 --> 23:51.263
You know nothing.

23:51.346 --> 23:52.389
You bitch.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.057
Hey.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.184
What did you say?

23:56.268 --> 23:57.352
Hey.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.397
How did you know I was stupid?

24:01.148 --> 24:02.816
Tell me. Is it on Facebook?

24:03.400 --> 24:05.610
Stop it. Let it go.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.362
Why the hell should she let it go?

24:07.863 --> 24:09.156
Ha-ri, don't hold back.

24:12.492 --> 24:13.994
You bitch.

24:16.079 --> 24:17.205
You little--

24:17.706 --> 24:19.040
Let go of me!

24:21.334 --> 24:22.627
-Come at me.
-Stop it.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.671
-Come at me, bitch.
-That's enough.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.631
-Come at me! Let go!
-Stop it.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.632
-Stop it!
-You bitch!

24:27.716 --> 24:29.092
-Let go!
-Do you want to die?

24:29.176 --> 24:30.177
Cut it out!

24:30.260 --> 24:31.845
-Hey.
-You said not to hold back!

24:31.928 --> 24:33.138
Are you touching my boobs?

24:34.723 --> 24:35.640
-Get lost.
-Move.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.142
Get out of the way!

24:37.225 --> 24:38.810
-Stop it!
-Who do you think--

24:38.894 --> 24:39.853
People.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.396
-ANYONE ALIVE?
-ANYBODY THERE?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.982
This is pure hell.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.359
The cops won't pick up.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.195
-IT'S SCARY
-LOOK AT THE VIEWS

24:48.278 --> 24:50.989
And there are no first responders.
Damn it!

24:51.072 --> 24:53.366
-LOOK AT HIS FACE LOL
-YOU REALLY WENT?

24:53.450 --> 24:56.620
I'm going to hide and wait to be rescued.

24:57.537 --> 25:01.958
Please subscribe
and like my channel, orangekay?

25:02.584 --> 25:05.837
Fuck. Don't you think I deserve a like?

25:06.588 --> 25:09.049
-IS THIS REAL?
-I RESPECT YOU, BROTHER

25:09.132 --> 25:11.801
Okay. I'm going to go now.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.639
-IS IT A VIRUS?
-WHERE'S YOUR BADASS AXE?

25:15.722 --> 25:19.100
What the hell?
What asshole threw away garbage here?

25:19.184 --> 25:21.895
-MY CONDOLENCES
-GARBAGE ASSHOLE LOL

25:21.978 --> 25:24.981
-LET'S NOT GO THERE
-SURE THERE'S NO ZOMBIES?

25:33.073 --> 25:34.866
Look, everyone.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.243
-I CAN'T TURN THIS OFF
-DON'T GO FURTHER

25:36.326 --> 25:37.410
It's clean.

25:38.119 --> 25:39.371
I think it's safe.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.081
-MY HEART'S RACING
-I HATE ZOMBIES

25:41.164 --> 25:42.415
I'll go in now.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.669
-IT'LL BE FULL OF ZOMBIES
-IS THIS REALLY SCARY?

25:45.752 --> 25:48.421
-YOU'RE WORKING HARD
-SHOULD'VE BROUGHT A GUN

25:48.505 --> 25:51.424
-WHY'D YOU GO TO HELL?
-STRAIGHT TO HELL

25:51.508 --> 25:54.427
-YOU SHOULD HIDE
-STOP GOING

25:54.511 --> 25:57.430
-BE CAREFUL
-WHAT IF THEY'RE IN THERE?

25:57.514 --> 26:00.517
-IT'S EMPTY, SPEND THE NIGHT
-DON'T MAKE A SOUND!

26:00.600 --> 26:03.353
It looks like there's no one here.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.439
-I'M SCARED…
-SAFETY FIRST!

26:06.523 --> 26:10.443
-IT'S TOO DARK…
-IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO RUN…

26:10.527 --> 26:11.403
Hold on.

26:12.904 --> 26:13.822
What is that?

26:13.905 --> 26:15.448
-THANKS FOR EVERYTHING
-BYE BYE

26:15.532 --> 26:18.535
-I HEAR SOMETHING
-WHAT IS IT?

26:18.618 --> 26:20.245
-ALL THIS JUST FOR LIKES
-WE'RE WATCHING SOMETHING DIE

26:20.328 --> 26:21.538
Damn it.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.498
-YOU'RE INSANE
-CUTE ZOMBIES LOL

26:23.582 --> 26:26.167
-RUN! RUN!
-I WANT TO GO THERE TOO

26:27.168 --> 26:28.169
This is bad.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.133
-SO SCARY
-IT'S ALL FAKE ANYWAY LOL

26:33.216 --> 26:34.926
-IS THAT REAL?
-KEEP STREAMING!

26:35.010 --> 26:37.679
Do you see that? Damn it. Where do I go?

26:42.267 --> 26:43.727
-IS THIS FOR REAL?
-DAMN

26:47.856 --> 26:49.024
Damn it.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.152
Seriously?

26:59.701 --> 27:00.577
Do you know

27:01.328 --> 27:03.580
what's going on out there?

27:07.751 --> 27:10.420
The strong are ripping apart the weak.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.297
It happens all the time.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.593
Are you crazy?

27:16.676 --> 27:18.053
The world is crazy.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.096
Why did you do this?

27:22.599 --> 27:24.392
I tried to tell everyone,
but no one listened.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.618
My son was bullied for a very long time.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.854
I only found out
after he tried to kill himself.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.483
I found out too late,

28:14.651 --> 28:16.277
but I thought I could fix it.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.780
SCHOOL VIOLENCE RESOLUTION COMMITTEE

28:18.863 --> 28:19.823
We were just…

28:20.490 --> 28:21.866
Well, we…

28:23.535 --> 28:25.036
We were only fooling around.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.795
Come on, guys.
We were just messing around.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.549
That's what we do when we hang out, right?

28:40.301 --> 28:41.261
Is that right?

28:48.226 --> 28:49.102
Eun-ji?

28:57.819 --> 28:58.695
Yes.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.578
I'm sure you know this
since you work at the school,

29:06.661 --> 29:09.164
but it's difficult to prove
what happened among kids,

29:09.247 --> 29:10.957
and it's difficult to punish them.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.792
They won't go to prison.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.211
The kids were just fooling around.

29:15.295 --> 29:18.798
How could you go to the police?
The school punished them. That's enough.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.134
Is writing apologies
considered "punishment"?

29:21.217 --> 29:22.719
They're students.

29:22.802 --> 29:25.805
They apologized and promised
not to do it again. Isn't that enough?

29:25.889 --> 29:27.515
We have evaluations coming up.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.018
Why make an issue of it
and blow it out of proportion?

29:30.769 --> 29:31.895
You're right.

29:31.978 --> 29:35.190
You were kicked out
of a pharmaceutical company

29:35.273 --> 29:36.858
and were a contract teacher.

29:36.941 --> 29:40.028
But our principal took you in
as a permanent teacher.

29:40.111 --> 29:43.573
You should think of the school too.

29:43.656 --> 29:45.283
That's how they always were.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.662
We transferred him immediately.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.291
But they kept finding him
and harassing him.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.544
It was fun for them.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.506
Like playing with a toy.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.966
Smile for the camera. Smile.

30:02.759 --> 30:03.593
Look at him.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.020
Dad.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.860
Just fight back instead.

30:23.488 --> 30:26.616
Fight as if your life depended on it!

30:29.452 --> 30:30.703
I'm sorry, Dad.

30:31.871 --> 30:33.373
I just want to die.

30:36.751 --> 30:38.461
I think that would be easier.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.631
That's when I realized it.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.010
We live in a system of violence.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.764
A nobody like me…

30:52.809 --> 30:54.352
can't change the system.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.449
That's why I decided to change my son.

31:11.077 --> 31:12.745
I just hoped he wouldn't die.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.207
I didn't want him
to try and commit suicide again.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.751
Please stop!

31:20.962 --> 31:22.046
You…

31:26.593 --> 31:28.052
created a monster.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.763
That's how desperate I was to save him.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.641
Rather than die as a human,

31:34.517 --> 31:36.561
I wanted him to survive as a monster.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.773
Don't you realize
that monster is killing everyone?

31:40.857 --> 31:43.818
Who cares if they all die?
They're all accomplices.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.361
You crazy bastard.

31:46.112 --> 31:47.864
Who made the world like this?

31:47.947 --> 31:50.533
I warned you countless times
that ignoring minor violence

31:50.617 --> 31:53.161
would result in violence
taking over the world.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.412
But no one listened.

31:55.121 --> 31:56.664
"It happens."

31:56.748 --> 32:00.293
"Kids fight. They were bullied
because they deserved it."

32:00.877 --> 32:03.254
Those who thought that and shunned them

32:03.338 --> 32:05.340
made this world what it is!

32:18.686 --> 32:22.190
No. You're the one who made this hellhole.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.692
As a cop, I'm partly responsible.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.779
Those who are out there dying
without knowing why?

32:27.862 --> 32:29.989
Sure. They may be partly responsible.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.743
But there are things
you must pay with death

32:33.826 --> 32:35.954
and things we must amend
while still alive.

32:36.037 --> 32:39.332
What you wanted was
for the world to change.

32:41.376 --> 32:44.921
Not for everyone to die like this, right?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.679
Day 39 of infection.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.515
I've tested several sedatives.

32:55.598 --> 32:56.975
The most effective…

33:06.567 --> 33:07.694
Where's the cure?

33:09.320 --> 33:11.406
There must be a form of treatment.

33:13.866 --> 33:14.784
There isn't.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.629
Let's go. We've been ordered to evacuate.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.480
What are you looking at, asshole? Get in.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.607
Shove them in.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.192
Yes, sir. Come on.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.362
Move quickly. Go.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.064
Hey. What's wrong?

34:26.147 --> 34:27.231
Help…

34:34.405 --> 34:35.990
What the hell?

35:23.412 --> 35:25.832
This is the closest they are
to following their raw instincts.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.585
This is just one side of human nature.

35:31.587 --> 35:33.798
Perhaps it's best
to accept them for what they are

35:35.049 --> 35:37.802
and give up on trying to cure them.

36:05.955 --> 36:06.831
Mr. Lee!

36:16.299 --> 36:17.884
My laptop is in the school science lab.

36:17.967 --> 36:18.801
Let's go.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.554
The solution is in there.
That's the only way.

36:21.637 --> 36:24.515
Fine, so let's get the laptop! Damn it.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.561
Lee Byeong-chan!

36:30.479 --> 36:32.773
Go! Get out of here!

36:33.649 --> 36:35.234
Hurry!

37:07.600 --> 37:09.560
Fuck. That was close.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.291
What the hell?

37:32.792 --> 37:35.253
Wait!

37:35.336 --> 37:36.587
Help me.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.964
I'm stuck.

37:39.548 --> 37:40.466
Come on.

38:00.403 --> 38:03.781
The standards of being human
emasculate human nature.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.575
How are we different from a seeing eye dog

38:06.659 --> 38:08.786
whose instincts to run
and bark are stripped?

38:09.954 --> 38:13.165
Must all dogs abandon their instincts
and become seeing eye dogs?

38:13.833 --> 38:16.836
Must everyone abandon their instincts
to become truly human?

38:40.109 --> 38:41.485
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.280
We're going to
the Disaster and Safety Management.

38:44.363 --> 38:47.783
We have to tell them to get the laptop
from the Hyosan High science lab.

38:47.867 --> 38:51.787
The solution to this disaster is in there.
Understand?

38:51.871 --> 38:53.831
Hyosan High. Science lab. Laptop.

38:54.707 --> 38:55.666
Why are you telling me?

38:55.750 --> 38:59.003
If I die, you have to stay alive
and tell them, you idiot.

38:59.086 --> 38:59.962
Me?

39:00.046 --> 39:01.505
You dumbass.

39:01.589 --> 39:02.757
Let's go.

39:04.759 --> 39:05.718
Where are you going?

39:05.801 --> 39:08.429
The Disaster and Safety Management.
I told you two seconds ago.

39:08.512 --> 39:09.680
Get with the program.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.933
-Where?
-Disaster and Safety Management.

39:13.017 --> 39:16.062
-And tell them what?
-Hyosan High, science lab, laptop.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.355
-That's right.
-Okay.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.482
-Are you ready?
-No.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.317
Let's go.

39:30.242 --> 39:31.243
Follow me.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.353
It's cold.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.560
No one came.

40:52.324 --> 40:53.576
This is driving me crazy.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.996
No cops and no cigarettes.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.498
Nothing.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.835
Really? Nobody came?

41:02.918 --> 41:03.961
Let me down.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.839
-My back.
-Damn.

41:12.052 --> 41:13.762
Hey. What do you want to do?

41:15.014 --> 41:17.725
We need to leave.
No one's coming to save us.

41:20.561 --> 41:23.481
All the zombies will see us right now.

41:23.564 --> 41:24.899
Let's go at night.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.984
Okay. You can stay right here.

41:28.527 --> 41:30.988
Let's go out back
and leave through the back gate.

41:31.071 --> 41:32.364
That's the fastest route.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.658
-I'm going to the second floor first.
-Why?

41:35.451 --> 41:38.579
My brother's a junior.
I need to check if he's there.

41:39.622 --> 41:43.792
Hey. Would a zombie sit
and wait at his desk in his classroom?

41:45.461 --> 41:46.879
Did you see him turn?

41:46.962 --> 41:48.464
He may have.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.216
There's no guarantee that he didn't.

41:50.758 --> 41:51.675
You little…

41:51.759 --> 41:53.511
Why are you guys arguing?

41:53.594 --> 41:54.887
Just fight some more.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.057
Sorry.

42:01.977 --> 42:03.395
Come with me if you want.

42:08.734 --> 42:11.695
She's so cool. Damn it.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.364
So annoying.

42:17.576 --> 42:18.452
Wait for me.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.955
They'll come for us eventually.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.498
How long do we wait?

42:23.332 --> 42:24.291
Until they come.

42:25.042 --> 42:26.919
We don't even know if they're coming.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.880
So? You want to go out there?

42:29.964 --> 42:33.467
But even if they come, they can't find us
if they don't know we're here.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.262
-We can put up a signal for help.
-How?

42:36.345 --> 42:40.182
My dad taught me a signal
that's used internationally.

42:40.683 --> 42:41.892
What is it?

42:42.893 --> 42:44.979
It's Cheong-san. See you later.

42:45.062 --> 42:46.772
Eat another bite.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.524
Hey!

42:48.607 --> 42:52.194
It was red and blue arranged together

42:53.028 --> 42:58.325
to create some sort of a pattern.

43:05.082 --> 43:07.293
Should we just write "SOS"
on the curtains?

43:07.376 --> 43:09.044
Yes, let's do that.

43:12.923 --> 43:15.926
We can't last long anyway.
Three minutes of no oxygen,

43:16.010 --> 43:17.970
three days of no water,
three weeks of no food.

43:18.053 --> 43:19.221
What's that?

43:19.305 --> 43:21.223
How long a person can survive.

43:21.307 --> 43:24.727
It's only been a day.
We have to try the best we can.

43:26.979 --> 43:28.939
We'll show signs of dehydration
after today.

43:29.023 --> 43:32.192
-We won't be able to move by tomorrow.
-What are you getting at?

43:33.235 --> 43:34.695
Are you saying we should go?

43:36.238 --> 43:40.075
Or are you saying we'll die anyway,
so we shouldn't bother doing anything?

43:46.999 --> 43:47.958
I don't know.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.752
Then don't say anything.

43:52.254 --> 43:57.426
I think Prez means
we should think about all of our options.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.011
Right?

43:59.928 --> 44:01.221
-No.
-No?

44:02.598 --> 44:04.058
I mean, we know nothing.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.894
We need to know more
to think and make plans--

44:06.977 --> 44:08.145
What do you mean?

44:08.228 --> 44:09.438
What she means--

44:09.521 --> 44:12.399
You don't know what she's saying either.

44:13.442 --> 44:14.318
Right.

44:16.904 --> 44:19.573
Are you saying we need to grasp
the situation before taking action?

44:20.699 --> 44:22.660
Yes, something like that.

44:22.743 --> 44:24.244
I agree.

44:25.162 --> 44:28.290
We need to know more to decide
whether to wait, run, or go out.

44:28.374 --> 44:31.418
How can we do that right now?

44:31.502 --> 44:33.754
We can go online if we have a phone.

44:35.255 --> 44:36.590
But we don't have one.

44:37.466 --> 44:38.509
In the teachers' office.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.639
Why are you telling me that now?

44:43.722 --> 44:44.598
Sorry.

44:45.307 --> 44:48.394
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
What can I do about it now?

44:52.773 --> 44:53.857
What time is it?

44:56.902 --> 44:57.736
It's 9:00 a.m.

44:58.821 --> 45:02.157
Hyosan High. Mo Eun-ji.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.827
Nude. Kim Cheol-su.

45:04.910 --> 45:05.869
SCHEDULE SETTINGS

45:05.953 --> 45:07.913
Schedule post…

45:07.996 --> 45:09.123
PROCESSING

45:09.206 --> 45:10.666
…for 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.210
Bring the money by 9:00 a.m.

45:13.877 --> 45:17.005
If you don't,
it'll be uploaded automatically.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.886
I just had to give him the money.

45:23.595 --> 45:26.056
But I couldn't because of the zombies.

45:26.140 --> 45:29.518
I was going to ask the rescuers
to find his phone if they came, but…

45:29.601 --> 45:31.061
It's past 9:00 a.m., right?

45:31.145 --> 45:32.730
How would I know? I don't have my phone.

45:33.564 --> 45:34.606
No.

45:35.399 --> 45:36.567
It can't be 9:00 a.m. yet.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.945
If that gets posted online, I'll…

45:45.451 --> 45:47.536
What's wrong? Where are you going?

45:48.203 --> 45:50.789
-Let go. I should've died yesterday.
-Don't say that.

45:51.290 --> 45:52.833
Please stop it!

45:52.916 --> 45:55.169
Whether or not you die,
the video will be posted.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.045
What will it change?

46:04.261 --> 46:05.137
You're right.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.974
Even if I die, everyone will see my body.

46:10.100 --> 46:11.059
Everyone will watch,

46:12.019 --> 46:12.978
and my mom…

46:13.812 --> 46:14.730
It'll be okay.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.983
We did nothing wrong.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.818
We were victims.

46:22.696 --> 46:23.614
I'm going.

46:24.573 --> 46:25.824
Where?

46:25.908 --> 46:27.534
-To get his phone.
-Are you insane?

46:30.037 --> 46:31.371
Will you come with me?

46:31.455 --> 46:33.707
-You filmed me.
-But…

46:33.791 --> 46:35.751
I had no choice. They made me do it.

46:35.834 --> 46:38.796
It's the same as committing murder
because you had no choice.

46:40.589 --> 46:41.757
Still,

46:43.425 --> 46:45.594
we'll die if we go.

46:45.677 --> 46:46.887
That's so you.

46:47.554 --> 46:49.598
You don't have
the courage to live or to die.

46:50.265 --> 46:52.226
You're a fucking coward, asshole.

47:19.586 --> 47:20.462
Cheong-san.

47:22.172 --> 47:24.007
Stop being so stubborn.

47:25.384 --> 47:28.262
The teachers' office is two rooms across
and one floor down.

47:28.345 --> 47:29.471
Don't go.

47:29.555 --> 47:31.849
I'll come back
if I can't make it all the way.

47:32.683 --> 47:35.018
-Don't worry.
-I'm not worried about you.

47:35.519 --> 47:36.895
I'm angry.

47:37.437 --> 47:40.023
Sure. Why would you worry about me?

47:45.028 --> 47:46.029
Damn it.

47:49.324 --> 47:50.826
Su-hyeok.

47:50.909 --> 47:51.827
I'll be back.

47:57.416 --> 47:58.542
Careful, Cheong-san.

48:01.253 --> 48:03.714
Bare-su is a man of loyalty.

48:03.797 --> 48:05.215
-You too?
-I'm going too.

48:05.299 --> 48:07.384
-Stop it. Come down.
-Why?

48:07.467 --> 48:09.511
You can't go out there
with that body, fatso.

48:10.220 --> 48:11.430
What's wrong with my body?

48:12.139 --> 48:13.098
What do you think?

48:25.068 --> 48:26.278
Why do you keep following me?

48:27.613 --> 48:28.572
Who else do you have?

48:30.657 --> 48:31.950
Stay close.

48:36.496 --> 48:37.372
Careful.

48:48.258 --> 48:49.635
Can we go in?

48:50.719 --> 48:51.553
Come back.

49:03.523 --> 49:04.775
What are you going to do?

49:08.862 --> 49:10.280
Let's hang by our hands and go.

49:12.908 --> 49:14.534
No, I mean…

49:16.328 --> 49:18.455
I heard that On-jo told you she likes you.

49:19.456 --> 49:22.334
-Are you going to go out with her?
-Is that important right now?

49:24.503 --> 49:27.673
I'm not asking because it's important.
I'm just curious.

49:29.675 --> 49:30.509
Why?

49:31.760 --> 49:33.345
-Should I go out with her?
-Hey.

49:34.096 --> 49:35.514
Why are you asking me?

49:36.139 --> 49:37.099
Do as you wish.

49:38.141 --> 49:39.351
What do you think?

49:41.478 --> 49:42.479
Go.

49:46.483 --> 49:47.317
Go.

49:47.401 --> 49:48.276
You go.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.115
Be careful.

50:40.704 --> 50:43.290
Why are you doing this to me?

50:46.418 --> 50:47.335
What is it?

52:24.474 --> 52:25.642
What is that?

52:26.601 --> 52:28.937
I don't know. Let's go see.

52:42.117 --> 52:43.326
I'll destroy them all.

52:44.202 --> 52:45.036
All of them.

52:50.625 --> 52:51.960
What the hell?

53:12.689 --> 53:13.899
GWI-NAM
UPLOAD

53:19.154 --> 53:19.988
That bastard.

54:01.780 --> 54:03.406
I'll kill you!

54:05.951 --> 54:07.744
Give it to me, fucker! I'll kill you!

54:13.250 --> 54:14.459
Cheong-san.

54:18.755 --> 54:19.923
Damn it.

54:36.439 --> 54:37.732
Go first. I'll catch up.

54:47.575 --> 54:48.868
Damn it.

54:56.710 --> 54:57.585
Hey.

54:58.211 --> 54:59.129
Wake up.

55:01.798 --> 55:03.091
You're Yoon Gwi-nam, right?

55:03.174 --> 55:04.509
What? Why?

55:05.635 --> 55:07.220
How is it outside? The same?

55:12.017 --> 55:12.934
I don't know.

55:14.769 --> 55:16.229
You know how to drive, right?

55:17.147 --> 55:19.024
-No.
-Yeah, right.

55:19.107 --> 55:21.568
You guys drove your dad's car
and crashed it last year.

55:21.651 --> 55:23.361
Do you know what a headache
that was for me?

55:24.571 --> 55:25.572
But why do you ask?

55:29.117 --> 55:31.870
My car is in the parking lot.
The plate number is 7340.

55:34.622 --> 55:36.458
Bring it here.

55:41.546 --> 55:42.505
Me?

55:43.089 --> 55:45.717
Go through the window
of the night duty room to the lot.

55:46.634 --> 55:47.677
I don't want to.

55:49.137 --> 55:51.389
You punk. Listen to your principal!

55:51.473 --> 55:52.891
I said I don't want to.

55:56.853 --> 55:58.355
-Give me that.
-Let go. You punk.

55:58.438 --> 56:00.648
Fuck! I said to let go.

56:01.316 --> 56:02.400
Damn it.

56:04.778 --> 56:06.196
Fine. Just go.

56:06.279 --> 56:07.113
Come with me.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.074
Why should I? Go.

56:09.157 --> 56:10.867
Come with me to the car.

56:10.950 --> 56:14.788
I wanted a shield anyway.

56:14.871 --> 56:16.748
What's wrong with you? Stay away.

56:18.750 --> 56:20.502
God.

56:22.420 --> 56:24.214
Look, Mr. Principal.

56:25.131 --> 56:26.508
If this were a game,

56:27.008 --> 56:30.887
I'd be… taking down the final boss,

56:31.930 --> 56:32.972
sir.

56:58.248 --> 56:59.124
Is that okay?

56:59.207 --> 57:00.208
Yes.

57:01.501 --> 57:04.587
Okay. We'll go to the rooftop now.

57:05.380 --> 57:07.674
Please work together as we practiced.

57:11.094 --> 57:12.387
Hurry!

57:12.971 --> 57:15.014
-How much longer?
-A little more.

57:15.098 --> 57:16.099
Hold on!

57:17.392 --> 57:20.270
-I'll do it. Block them with the desk.
-Yes, sir!

57:20.353 --> 57:22.147
-Come with me.
-Okay!

57:27.777 --> 57:30.155
Okay, come one by one.

57:31.156 --> 57:33.074
Ma'am, go first.

57:33.158 --> 57:34.784
-You go first.
-You first!

57:34.868 --> 57:37.287
-Anybody! Come!
-Go! Hurry!

57:39.080 --> 57:40.874
Go! Hurry! Go!

57:45.003 --> 57:48.423
Okay. Run here together on my signal.

57:48.506 --> 57:50.967
Three! Two! One!

57:51.676 --> 57:52.927
Now!

57:55.847 --> 57:56.723
Get back!

58:07.025 --> 58:08.651
Charge!

58:13.323 --> 58:14.741
Hurry!

58:17.619 --> 58:19.204
-Back up!
-Yes, sir!

58:25.752 --> 58:26.753
I've got it!

58:32.425 --> 58:33.551
What now?

58:33.635 --> 58:34.594
Hello…

58:38.264 --> 58:39.641
Close the door!

58:43.102 --> 58:44.103
Captain, downstairs!

58:57.700 --> 58:58.868
Captain, here too!

59:11.214 --> 59:12.173
Upstairs…

59:12.257 --> 59:13.550
Go up first.

59:13.633 --> 59:14.467
We can't.

59:15.468 --> 59:17.262
The door to the rooftop is locked.

59:17.345 --> 59:18.388
What?

59:18.471 --> 59:20.098
The door is locked!

59:21.307 --> 59:23.726
-U-sin, do you have the tools?
-Yes, I do.

59:24.477 --> 59:26.187
-Go upstairs.
-What about the door?

59:26.896 --> 59:28.106
Hurry!

59:29.065 --> 59:30.650
Go up now!

59:31.609 --> 59:32.569
Hurry.

59:50.128 --> 59:52.088
-Get out of the way.
-Step aside.

1:00:04.058 --> 1:00:05.184
Help him!

1:00:08.313 --> 1:00:09.314
A little more!

1:00:15.737 --> 1:00:18.239
-Okay. One more time.
-Okay. One, two, three.

1:00:56.903 --> 1:00:58.821
-Hurry, ma'am.
-After you, ma'am.

1:00:59.572 --> 1:01:00.657
All right, let's go.

1:01:42.615 --> 1:01:44.075
Damn it.

1:01:44.575 --> 1:01:45.910
Hurry up!

1:01:49.664 --> 1:01:50.707
What happened?

1:01:51.916 --> 1:01:53.167
Careful. Hold on.

1:02:17.692 --> 1:02:19.360
You all did great.

1:02:20.653 --> 1:02:21.571
Is anyone hurt?

1:03:11.746 --> 1:03:14.749
-Sir.
-What are you doing? Grab this psycho!

1:03:15.333 --> 1:03:16.459
Hey, Gwi-nam.

1:03:16.542 --> 1:03:17.543
Cheong-san.

1:03:17.627 --> 1:03:19.295
Come here and tie his arms.

1:03:19.796 --> 1:03:21.339
He won't stay still.

1:03:21.923 --> 1:03:23.674
Hey. What are you doing?

1:03:24.967 --> 1:03:26.427
Come and tie him up.

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:29.138
You're finished.
You're expelled! Untie me!

1:03:31.015 --> 1:03:31.974
Gwi-nam!

1:03:32.058 --> 1:03:33.267
Don't do that.

1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:38.606
Don't do what? This principal bastard

1:03:40.233 --> 1:03:41.400
tried to kill me.

1:03:44.779 --> 1:03:47.532
He told me to go out and get his car.

1:03:48.115 --> 1:03:49.033
Is that okay?

1:03:50.451 --> 1:03:52.203
-Hey.
-That's it. Good job.

1:03:52.829 --> 1:03:53.996
I'm filming everything.

1:03:55.164 --> 1:03:57.124
Let him go
or I'll send this to the police.

1:03:57.208 --> 1:03:59.794
I'm going to kill you.

1:03:59.877 --> 1:04:02.046
Please stop acting like human trash.

1:04:03.422 --> 1:04:05.383
No one respects you
just because you act tough.

1:04:05.466 --> 1:04:07.343
I'm the head boss of this school now.

1:04:08.261 --> 1:04:09.095
Don't you get it?

1:04:09.178 --> 1:04:10.555
My ass, you are.

1:04:11.556 --> 1:04:15.393
You're just a loser scumbag
who'll spend his entire life

1:04:16.310 --> 1:04:17.562
serving bullies.

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:26.863
Say that again.

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:39.917
You fucking…

1:04:43.170 --> 1:04:45.256
Am I still a loser?

1:04:46.382 --> 1:04:47.383
Am I?

1:04:48.134 --> 1:04:51.178
Everyone who doesn't listen to me dies.
Give me the phone.

1:04:51.762 --> 1:04:53.514
-You just killed--
-Give me the phone!

1:05:06.986 --> 1:05:07.862
Damn it!

1:09:19.697 --> 1:09:22.366
