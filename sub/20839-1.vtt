WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:03.836
This is the test.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.089
It's a bit low.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.427
Let's try again.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.472
Looks a bit better.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.226
Okay, is this thing on?

00:22.481 --> 00:24.316
What now?

00:25.651 --> 00:26.485
Hey, guys.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.529
What are you doing?

00:30.364 --> 00:31.865
I wanna try it, daddy.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.576
I wanna try to do it to you.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.411
So it's recording
the whole thing.

00:36.495 --> 00:39.623
Video is movement,
as opposed to still.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.750
So you can do cool dancing.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.210
[kid laughing]

00:43.335 --> 00:44.169
[Jesse] Did it.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.087
[Andy] You got one?

00:45.212 --> 00:49.925
-Let's take a look.
-[laughs]

00:57.182 --> 00:58.767
[Vashti] Here comes Indi.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.186
[Andy] Aw, you're big,
aren't you?

01:01.270 --> 01:02.437
[Vashti] Ready, Jesse?

01:02.521 --> 01:04.022
Wow, through his legs.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.066
Okay, hang on. Whoo!

01:06.567 --> 01:08.986
[Jesse] Dad, dad like this?

01:09.945 --> 01:11.697
Dad, dad like this?

01:11.780 --> 01:12.698
[Andy] Yeah.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.199
[Indigo] Hi, daddy.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.042
[Vashti] So what have
you got there, Andy pants?

01:24.126 --> 01:25.252
So this just arrived.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.170
Sharp.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.755
That's real metal.

01:30.507 --> 01:33.635
[Vashti] That was daddy's
sword in <i>Spartacus,</i> Jesse.

01:33.719 --> 01:34.553
Can I hold it?

01:34.636 --> 01:36.305
And look,
they've put my name on it.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.681
[Vashti] <i>Spartacus</i> being
the start

01:37.764 --> 01:40.100
of this crazy old journey.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.102
[Jesse] Whoa, this is heavy.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.270
[Andy] It's really heavy.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.147
[Indigo] Heavy, heavy.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.649
[Vashti] So here we
have my beautiful husband

01:47.733 --> 01:50.235
who has just finished
his bone marry biopsy.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.320
Was I? I must've been out.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.946
-[Vashti] Yeah.
-I don't remember much.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.199
But the cancer is back.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.077
And, I guess where we're at is

01:59.161 --> 02:03.332
at a point of learning to
live with cancer again,

02:03.415 --> 02:06.585
and all the repercussions
and fears

02:06.668 --> 02:08.044
and everything
that go with that.

02:08.127 --> 02:11.006
[Andy] And that's why we need
to take it day by day,

02:11.465 --> 02:13.216
beat this disease and...

02:17.512 --> 02:18.972
Live happily ever after.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.062
[indistinct audio]

02:27.564 --> 02:30.859
We have a way
in our lives and world

02:30.942 --> 02:33.236
where if we really focus
on something

02:33.320 --> 02:34.863
and we really want
to make something happen,

02:34.946 --> 02:36.657
we put absolutely everything
into it.

02:36.740 --> 02:37.574
Yummy.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.992
So there's a ham that's
slightly overcooked.

02:39.284 --> 02:42.454
[Vashti]
<i>Even if it takes years, </i>
<i>we are capable,</i>

02:42.746 --> 02:45.165
together, Andy and I, of making

02:45.290 --> 02:46.625
<i>extraordinary things happen.</i>

02:48.085 --> 02:49.461
[chattering]

02:50.212 --> 02:51.963
[Andy]
<i>Vashti and I have always had</i>

02:52.339 --> 02:55.384
<i>an amazing relationship,</i>
<i>and we've achieved some</i>

02:55.467 --> 02:58.762
<i>quite remarkable </i>
<i>things together </i>
<i>in a relatively short time.</i>

03:00.972 --> 03:03.475
<i>Because we believe that</i>
<i>all that is attainable.</i>

03:06.937 --> 03:09.689
<i>And it's such </i>
<i>a powerful place to be</i>

03:09.773 --> 03:11.066
<i>when you can think like that.</i>

03:11.775 --> 03:14.027
It creates a space for you
to be clear

03:14.111 --> 03:18.407
and to run your life with your
intuition and not with fear.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.367
[laughing]

03:22.953 --> 03:25.497
Our life
has never been ordinary.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.957
Thank god, you know?

03:27.165 --> 03:30.377
And we have a commitment that
we have an extraordinary life.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.462
Look at that face.
You see that face?

03:32.546 --> 03:33.797
[Vashti] <i>But it doesn't matter</i>

03:33.964 --> 03:36.258
<i>if we are successful or not.</i>

03:37.509 --> 03:41.304
<i>It's about the journey</i>
<i>and if you commit to it,</i>

03:41.388 --> 03:43.473
<i>something extraordinary </i>
<i>will come of it.</i>

03:44.099 --> 03:46.810
[Vashti]
Hey, Indi, how old are you
going to be on your birthday?

03:47.269 --> 03:48.979
-Three.
-[Vashti] Three?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.397
With five fingers. [laughs]

03:51.231 --> 03:52.274
[Andy]
How old are you going to be?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.402
-Six.
-[Vashti] Holy Mackerel, six.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.737
-[Andy] Sixteen?
-No, six.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.739
[Vashti] And how old are
you going to be, old bugger?

03:58.989 --> 04:02.200
-[Andy] I'm going to be 80.
-No, 40.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.245
[Andy] 39, I'm going to be
this year.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.164
-[Vashti] What a year.
-What a year.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.999
-[Vashti] The year.
-I shall remember it.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.584
-[Vashti laughs]
-Time.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.010
[woman 1] Okay.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.306
[woman 2] It's still running?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.265
[woman 1] Yup.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.394
[man] Take five-three.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.812
Thank you.

04:30.896 --> 04:33.440
[Andy] <i>I've spent the last</i>
<i>eight years</i>

04:33.815 --> 04:35.609
<i>trying to make it as an actor,</i>

04:37.027 --> 04:38.695
<i>and I pushed hard to get there.</i>

04:41.198 --> 04:43.784
<i>And it was the end </i>
<i>of a long campaign</i>

04:43.992 --> 04:49.122
<i>when I auditioned for the lead</i>
<i>of a huge American TV series.</i>

04:50.791 --> 04:52.209
[Vashti] <i>At one point </i>
<i>in that journey,</i>

04:52.292 --> 04:54.628
Andy had gone out for
<i>Spartacus</i> and he was in LA.

04:55.295 --> 04:59.090
Whatever happens to me,
my men, their families,

04:59.174 --> 05:01.384
happen because we choose it.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.346
We decide our destiny.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.265
Not the Romans.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.143
And I remember that
day I wore a little note

05:10.268 --> 05:12.813
in both cups of my bra,
'cause I had boobs then,

05:12.979 --> 05:15.232
saying, "Andy is Spartacus.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.150
Andy is Spartacus."

05:17.317 --> 05:18.777
I kept sending him emails
saying,

05:18.860 --> 05:20.779
"How fantastic.
You've got Spartacus."

05:20.862 --> 05:21.822
Before he even got it.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.158
We made it happen,
and that's how we roll.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.202
[woman] Why are you here?
What's happening?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.119
What's going on?

05:28.203 --> 05:29.412
Well, this is, this is real.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.039
That's real sweat.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.417
This is Gladiator Boot Camp.

05:36.294 --> 05:40.632
I started yesterday and
my buttocks are killing me.

05:45.136 --> 05:48.306
<i>I turn up one day going, "</i>
<i>This is actually </i>
<i>bit terrifying now </i>

05:48.390 --> 05:50.642
<i>because this is what</i>

05:50.725 --> 05:52.352
<i>and it's here </i>
<i>and I have to deliver."</i>

05:52.644 --> 05:53.687
[director] Action.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.147
[Vashti] <i>Andy literally</i>
<i>arrived back from LA</i>

05:56.439 --> 05:58.525
<i>and went straight off </i>
<i>to start shooting</i>

05:58.608 --> 06:00.694
<i>in New Zealand and</i>
<i>suddenly becoming Spartacus</i>

06:00.986 --> 06:05.240
<i>and cutting a six pack and</i>
<i>glutes and pecks of steel.</i>

06:05.323 --> 06:06.366
[director] Action.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.244
[Andy] <i>I mean, I was exhausted,</i>

06:09.327 --> 06:11.496
<i>but I'm pretty sure </i>
<i>anyone would've been.</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:14.499
It's one of the most extreme
things I've ever gone through.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.379
[upbeat music playing]

06:22.674 --> 06:24.634
I keep pace with
the mighty Spartacus.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.345
[Andy] <i>I think Spartacus </i>
<i>is a unique show.</i>

06:27.429 --> 06:28.972
<i>I mean, you're walking</i>
<i>around in your underwear.</i>

06:29.055 --> 06:32.100
<i>You have to train </i>
<i>your arse off</i>
<i>just to look the part,</i>

06:32.183 --> 06:34.477
<i>let alone doing your</i>
<i>own fight choreography</i>

06:34.936 --> 06:36.646
<i>and the long film days.</i>

06:38.857 --> 06:39.858
Spartacus!

06:47.657 --> 06:49.075
That is not my name.

06:51.703 --> 06:56.041
[Andy]
<i>And of course, the action is</i>
<i>a big component of this show.</i>

06:56.333 --> 06:58.501
<i>But it's just there to</i>
<i>highlight the drama.</i>

07:01.254 --> 07:04.382
<i>The story is about an everyman</i>
<i>who finds himself</i>

07:04.674 --> 07:07.927
<i>captured by the supposedly</i>
<i>civilized Romans,</i>

07:08.470 --> 07:11.056
<i>and is forced to fight</i>
<i>for his own survival.</i>

Begin.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.143
[crowd cheering]

07:15.560 --> 07:16.561
[Spartacus screaming]

07:21.066 --> 07:22.317
[groaning]

07:23.443 --> 07:25.195
[Andy] <i>And I think</i>
<i>as the show continues,</i>

07:26.071 --> 07:28.782
<i>his passion to help</i>
<i>liberate all the people</i>

07:28.865 --> 07:31.993
<i>trapped by circumstances </i>
<i>of which they had no control</i>

07:32.494 --> 07:35.497
<i>becomes something that he can</i>
<i>really put his energy into.</i>

07:37.958 --> 07:39.250
How much longer?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.380
How much blood
until we're free?

07:43.755 --> 07:44.589
Soon.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.592
I promise you.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.389
<i>He just can't sit back</i>
<i>and take the abuse.</i>

07:52.472 --> 07:55.266
<i>He will make a stand for</i>
<i>everyone and everything.</i>

07:57.394 --> 07:59.980
<i>However many times </i>
<i>they knock him down,</i>

08:02.065 --> 08:04.985
<i>while there is still blood</i>
<i>pumping through his veins,</i>

08:05.110 --> 08:07.696
<i>he will get up and fight </i>
<i>and fight</i>

08:07.821 --> 08:09.823
<i>and never, never, ever stop.</i>

08:18.373 --> 08:19.791
<i>And there's certainly </i>
<i>parts of me</i>

08:19.874 --> 08:21.626
<i>that I can identify with that.</i>

08:22.752 --> 08:26.798
<i>So it's really my dream role</i>
<i>to be the title character</i>

08:26.881 --> 08:29.634
<i>and to collaborate with</i>
<i>all these amazing people.</i>

08:30.552 --> 08:31.845
How white your teeth are.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.015
Amazing.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.599
-Got the gladiator smile.
-[Andy] It's 73 B.C.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.101
It's the gladiator smile.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.981
[Andy] <i>And to have a show so</i>
<i>well-received and successful,</i>

08:43.063 --> 08:45.483
<i>I sort of had everything </i>
<i>at my feet.</i>

08:47.152 --> 08:50.822
[crowd cheering and applauding]

08:56.244 --> 09:00.165
I am Spartacus.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.594
Season one of <i>Spartacus</i>
finished,

09:13.386 --> 09:16.931
and I was in a lot of, a lot
of pain at the end of that,

09:17.015 --> 09:19.142
and wasn't sure what it was
and it wasn't going away.

09:19.350 --> 09:23.396
I got a call saying,
"Hon, I'm in trouble."

09:23.480 --> 09:24.606
And I said, "What do you mean?

09:24.689 --> 09:26.483
You've just gone to
see a sport's doctor."

09:26.816 --> 09:29.152
And he said,
"I think I've got cancer."

09:29.569 --> 09:32.238
And I threw myself in
a taxi and raced across

09:32.489 --> 09:37.494
Sydney to look at a huge X-ray,
a basic one, nonetheless,

09:37.952 --> 09:41.331
of my husband's body with
black patches everywhere.

09:41.539 --> 09:45.293
I ended up being diagnosed
with Non-hodgkin's Lymphoma,

09:45.376 --> 09:48.213
and it was pretty extreme.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.964
It was stage four at the time,

09:50.590 --> 09:54.677
and so everything went on hold
with a view to coming back.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.265
My oncologist was saying,

10:00.266 --> 10:01.601
"You know,
if you want to get cancer,

10:01.684 --> 10:04.062
this is the one you want.
It's 80% treatable.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.231
You're young and healthy.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.732
You'll just breeze
through the treatment."

10:08.024 --> 10:11.820
And so, I never, ever,
ever was scared of it.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.824
[Vashti]
<i>The whole treatment, </i>
<i>Andy had to go through </i>

10:15.907 --> 10:17.450
<i>the chemotherapy,</i>
<i>but he did it</i>

10:17.534 --> 10:20.370
<i>extraordinarily gracefully,</i>
<i>humbly,</i>

10:20.453 --> 10:24.082
<i>and he gave everything to</i>
<i>how he could heal himself.</i>

10:24.249 --> 10:26.960
<i>I really fell in love with</i>
<i>him even more through that.</i>

10:31.297 --> 10:34.801
I went into remission,
which was great.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.220
Everything got back on track

10:37.303 --> 10:39.973
and I galloped
to the next season, season two.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.686
[audience applauding
and cheering]

10:47.105 --> 10:48.481
[woman] Come on, Andy!

10:52.861 --> 10:54.237
The champion of Capua,

10:54.320 --> 10:56.447
the bringer of rain,
Andy Whitfield.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.745
You know, I'd like to have
this opportunity as well

11:02.829 --> 11:05.331
just to thank some of the
messages I got from the fans.

11:05.415 --> 11:08.293
It was, it was kind of, you
know, profound

11:08.376 --> 11:12.380
and moving to get such a
connection from complete
strangers.

11:12.463 --> 11:13.339
So, thank you.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.757
You gave me a great lift
when I needed it.

11:14.841 --> 11:15.717
Thanks.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.177
<i>Since then, I had to</i>
<i>have an insurance scan</i>

11:18.261 --> 11:20.054
for season two to go
back to shoot, you know,

11:20.680 --> 11:23.349
just to make sure I was still
okay, still in remission.

11:25.935 --> 11:30.106
<i>And they found a resilient</i>
<i>little subset of cells</i>

11:31.149 --> 11:33.735
and they said, "You
know, if you do nothing,

11:33.818 --> 11:35.528
you'll be dead within
three to six months."

11:40.450 --> 11:41.743
It just doesn't add up to me.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.120
You know, when I asked the
oncologist

11:44.203 --> 11:47.290
what causes the disease
I have...

11:48.207 --> 11:49.042
No idea.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.252
No idea.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.962
I mean,
how do you fix something

11:53.046 --> 11:54.172
if you don't know the cause?

11:54.255 --> 11:57.592
You can patch it up, but does
it take away the conditions

11:57.675 --> 12:00.094
that created it and maintained
it in the first place?

12:00.929 --> 12:03.598
And so I've just become
fascinated

12:03.681 --> 12:05.475
with that question
right now, and...

12:08.770 --> 12:10.980
I think there's a whole
world out there to...

12:13.274 --> 12:15.151
to look at, to try and
answer that question.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.198
What I want for us now
is to be really clear

12:20.281 --> 12:22.700
about what we want from
this journey and that is...

12:26.204 --> 12:28.039
to just learn from each other,

12:28.414 --> 12:31.125
grow from it, and not be
frightened by it.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.882
In my heart,
I am convinced that...

12:39.550 --> 12:40.927
this is all meant to be.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.596
I'm supposed to be right
here, right now, and...

12:47.058 --> 12:51.020
I'm open to the journey
and to the discoveries

12:51.104 --> 12:54.482
and to the adventure
of all of this.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.821
<i>Be here now </i>
<i>is all about being present</i>

12:59.904 --> 13:02.073
<i>and not fearing </i>
<i>what you don't know.</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:07.537
And so I feel really passionate
and inspired to do this

13:07.996 --> 13:10.456
even though I have no idea
how it's going to turn out.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.754
[soothing music]

13:31.853 --> 13:34.272
It's the weekend,
and it's the day after

13:34.355 --> 13:37.025
we've just found out
that Andy's got...

13:38.693 --> 13:42.572
the lymphoma's come back.

13:43.698 --> 13:47.368
And I've had all sorts of
fucking

13:47.452 --> 13:49.871
scary information about
what that means.

13:51.164 --> 13:57.462
I think I'm just so numb
from too much information

13:59.338 --> 14:01.340
that I just don't know
how I feel right now.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.440
[Vashti] <i>Let's go in with the</i>
<i>context of just hearing</i>

14:17.523 --> 14:21.110
<i>about a second opinion </i>
<i>and make sure</i>

14:21.194 --> 14:22.987
<i>that the treatment will</i>
<i>actually have some effect </i>

14:23.071 --> 14:24.864
<i>on overpowering </i>
<i>the cancer.</i>

14:31.913 --> 14:33.414
To me, it's very simple.

14:33.498 --> 14:37.835
The best chance
of long term survival,

14:38.294 --> 14:41.005
long term remission,
living happily ever after,

14:41.506 --> 14:44.801
is to have some
reinduction therapy

14:45.301 --> 14:47.303
and then get your stem cells
collected,

14:47.387 --> 14:48.846
and then have a stem cell
transplant.

14:48.930 --> 14:53.142
And can you explain to
me what the principle is?

14:53.559 --> 14:56.729
Phase A: two cycles of
reinduction chemotherapy.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.856
-Each take about four weeks.
-[Andy] Yeah.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.026
During one or both of those,
we'll collect stem cells.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.363
Then, we'll do phase B,
which is

15:05.446 --> 15:07.865
the big dose of chemotherapy,
the biggest hammer

15:08.116 --> 15:09.659
to knock the disease out.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.496
Then, we'll look at
your own bone marrow.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.331
But as soon as we've
done the chemotherapy,

15:15.415 --> 15:19.043
we rescue your bone marrow
with the stem cell transplant.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.461
Okay.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.880
You have to be convinced that
this is the right treatment

15:22.964 --> 15:24.132
and then get on and do it.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.049
Sure.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.968
But it doesn't mean
do it tomorrow.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.719
We have a little bit of time.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.721
Right, okay.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.598
[shaky voice]
I'm going to cry.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.225
I just feel so relieved,

15:34.308 --> 15:37.979
just speaking to someone
who's speaking about it

15:38.062 --> 15:40.231
without this like, "You don't
do this.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.316
You're going to die and
you can't see your kids."

15:43.651 --> 15:45.945
It just feels really good
to hear it said

15:46.028 --> 15:49.615
with such grace and I
know nothing's a certain,

15:49.699 --> 15:52.869
but it just feels
strangely more supportive.

15:53.953 --> 15:54.787
Sort of.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.835
Sorry, I'm fine.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.211
[Andy] Do you have this effect
on everyone?

16:02.295 --> 16:04.088
[John] Yeah, I always make
women cry.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.339
[all laughing]

16:07.508 --> 16:10.511
[slow guitar music]

16:15.266 --> 16:18.853
<i>My oncologist said, "Let's</i>
<i>do some rounds of chemo,</i>

16:18.936 --> 16:22.190
<i>get it in remission, do</i>
<i>the stem cell transplant,</i>

16:23.566 --> 16:25.568
<i>and hopefully live happily</i>
<i>ever after."</i>

16:28.488 --> 16:33.075
I've just been liberated
and so free all day,

16:33.910 --> 16:38.831
and I guess now the night's
coming, and I'm tired.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.124
I've been up since
four this morning.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.630
And I'm starting
to panic, again.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.466
And...

16:51.010 --> 16:51.844
Yeah.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.982
<i>When I was first</i>
<i>diagnosed, I got treatment.</i>

17:05.066 --> 17:07.443
<i>I had chemotherapy </i>
<i>and at the time,</i>

17:07.527 --> 17:09.779
<i>my oncologist was saying, </i>
<i>"80% of people</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:11.614
<i>who go through this </i>
<i>go into remission."</i>

17:11.864 --> 17:13.324
-You gonna race with us?
-[Indigo] Yeah.

17:13.491 --> 17:14.325
Okay.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.077
[Jesse] On your marks,
get set...

17:16.285 --> 17:17.161
[both] Go!

17:18.621 --> 17:20.414
Go, Indi! Get him.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.376
<i>But in my case,</i>
<i>it wasn't successful,</i>

17:23.459 --> 17:24.794
<i>and what they're saying now </i>
<i>is that</i>

17:24.877 --> 17:27.296
<i>there is a second level</i>
<i>of treatment.</i>

17:30.216 --> 17:32.593
<i>But only 25% of the people</i>
<i>that go through</i>

17:32.677 --> 17:36.097
<i>the best that the world</i>
<i>has to offer make it.</i>

17:38.349 --> 17:41.310
<i>It's suddenly a different</i>
<i>level of things at stake.</i>

17:44.397 --> 17:46.649
<i>Where I'm at right now</i>
<i>is trying to understand</i>

17:46.732 --> 17:49.944
<i>the current approach and</i>
<i>is it the best way to go.</i>

17:51.612 --> 17:52.697
They did a biopsy
and they found

17:52.780 --> 17:55.950
-a subset of resilient cells.
-[therapist] Yup.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.910
And so they're kind of saying,

17:57.994 --> 17:59.537
"You have to go onto
the next level of treatment."

17:59.620 --> 18:00.538
[therapist] Which is?

18:00.621 --> 18:02.248
[Andy] Much more intense chemo.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.207
Okay.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.501
[Andy] <i>It's my responsibility</i>
<i>to pursue</i>

18:05.585 --> 18:08.421
<i>whatever I need to do</i>
<i>to get my health back</i>

18:09.046 --> 18:13.551
<i>whether it's through</i>
<i>chemotherapy</i>
<i>or alternative treatment.</i>

18:14.885 --> 18:17.471
<i>And then there's the</i>
<i>whole psychological side</i>

18:17.555 --> 18:18.848
<i>of all that has to do with it.</i>

18:19.515 --> 18:23.811
I'd like you to think back
to a time when something...

18:26.981 --> 18:28.274
really got your attention.

18:29.609 --> 18:33.404
[Andy] <i>I think having </i>
<i>a positive outlook</i>

18:33.487 --> 18:35.156
<i>in your own treatment </i>
<i>has gotta help,</i>

18:36.198 --> 18:40.161
<i>even if it's a 1% improvement</i>
<i>in your prognosis.</i>

18:41.370 --> 18:42.663
Tell me what you're noticing

18:42.747 --> 18:44.749
right now about the sensation.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.834
It's like a stadium.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.754
Okay, what do you notice
about the energy
of the stadium?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.631
Everyone is cheering.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.759
And have you noticed
who they're cheering for?

18:57.720 --> 18:58.763
Yeah.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.850
And just allow that to
completely fill your body,

19:04.143 --> 19:07.938
bathing in that feeling
of being supported.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.779
Daddy's here!

19:17.782 --> 19:20.951
Dad, do you want me to do
one of your rolls in <i>Spartacus?</i>

19:21.035 --> 19:21.952
[Andy] Yeah.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.792
[Vashti] <i>We're in a real</i>
<i>crossroads about what to do.</i>

19:27.875 --> 19:28.709
Daddy.

19:28.793 --> 19:29.960
Can I have a kiss?

19:30.503 --> 19:31.504
Can I have a kiss?

19:33.339 --> 19:36.634
Andy is literally on hoof
running from...

19:36.717 --> 19:40.763
one inquiry to another,
from Ayurvedic medicine

19:40.846 --> 19:43.140
<i>to acupuncture, all of</i>
<i>which if it were me,</i>

19:43.224 --> 19:44.558
<i>I would be doing too.</i>

19:45.559 --> 19:48.729
<i>And, I am in no way pushing</i>
<i>him to do chemotherapy.</i>

19:49.146 --> 19:51.232
<i>But you just want to do </i>
<i>what you think</i>

19:51.315 --> 19:53.192
<i>will fix the situation.</i>

19:55.236 --> 19:58.572
And I've caught myself doing
that with such surprise
recently,

19:58.781 --> 20:01.784
like wanting Andy
to just get well,

20:01.867 --> 20:04.078
just do the quick thing
so we can get on.

20:07.873 --> 20:11.001
[Andy] <i>I've read plenty of</i>
<i>anecdotal stuff about people</i>

20:11.085 --> 20:14.255
doing this whole Ayurvedic
treatment to manifest health.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.758
You know, I'm obviously being
advised to do chemotherapy.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.971
They've said, "We'll book
you for the 3rd of November."

20:22.430 --> 20:24.390
And I think three weeks,
I could go to India.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.977
I could, you know, I could go
and see what that does first.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.730
I can't see how that could be
a process

20:30.813 --> 20:33.107
that wouldn't assist
and even allow your body

20:33.190 --> 20:36.026
to get strong so that
should you have to go down

20:36.110 --> 20:38.821
that chemotherapy path,
you're going to be in an

20:38.904 --> 20:41.741
even better position to be
able to manage that process.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.788
I feel like I'm on a path
and if I choose one way,

20:48.247 --> 20:49.957
I'll be fine. I will.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.626
If I go chemotherapy, I'll get
through. I'll be in the 25%.

20:52.710 --> 20:53.878
-Yeah.
-I don't doubt that.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.129
But.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.883
But there's this whole other

20:58.966 --> 21:03.137
path here that
I really believe in.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.138
Yeah.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.348
I believe in this more
than I do this right now.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.685
And maybe that's what's
the problem for me.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.062
Can I just say
I do support that.

21:12.146 --> 21:15.566
-I second you doing that 100%.
-Well, I do need.

21:15.649 --> 21:18.861
I just need some support
on it from the people
around me

21:18.944 --> 21:20.279
because I just feel like I'm...

21:21.197 --> 21:23.991
I'm doing it on my own
and people think I'm mad.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.659
[Vashti] Who thinks you're mad?

21:25.743 --> 21:26.660
You do.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.746
[Vashti] I don't think, I've
never said I think I'm mad.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.915
-No, but.
-So here's the thing.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.669
Sometimes what you're getting
is this unprocessed me,

21:35.753 --> 21:37.880
you know, like I might,
like last night

21:37.963 --> 21:40.257
I dreamt about this,
I dreamt about it.

21:40.341 --> 21:41.801
Because it's my girlfriend's
anniversary

21:41.884 --> 21:44.303
of dying three years ago
from cancer. [shaky voice]

21:44.512 --> 21:47.598
Last night, I dreamt that
you, we just didn't have time,

21:47.681 --> 21:49.600
and we'd left it too late.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.268
And you went in for chemo
and they said,

21:51.352 --> 21:54.104
"I'm sorry, we can't do it
because it's everywhere.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.773
It's too late."

21:56.065 --> 21:57.733
And I just remember thinking,

21:58.067 --> 21:59.819
"If we'd just been open
to everything

21:59.902 --> 22:03.531
and tried everything,
Jesse would have a dad."

22:04.448 --> 22:07.493
And that was my dream
and it's terrifying.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.912
-So I wake up.
-You go off and meditate.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.288
I go down, make lunches,

22:11.372 --> 22:13.123
have the gorgeous little
people screaming at me,

22:13.207 --> 22:15.459
yelling at me, and what's
still going on in my head.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.669
[Indigo shouting]

22:17.002 --> 22:21.173
Is that we didn't have time,
and then you're saying,

22:21.257 --> 22:23.926
"You're not supporting me" and
I'm trying to process that,

22:24.009 --> 22:26.053
get that silly thought out of
my head

22:26.136 --> 22:27.680
because I don't believe it
anyway,

22:27.888 --> 22:30.891
but it's in my whole
body, to then support you

22:30.975 --> 22:33.727
going off and doing some
more exploratory work,

22:34.645 --> 22:37.481
you know, when I know that...

22:39.191 --> 22:41.485
all day I'm going
to be feeling strange.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.955
[crying] As a mother
with two children,

22:53.038 --> 22:55.583
there's a protective
streak in you that goes,

22:56.584 --> 22:59.086
"What if he did die?"

23:00.254 --> 23:02.339
And that's an awful thing
and something I can't

23:02.423 --> 23:06.552
explain to Andy, but it's
in me as the possible...

23:07.094 --> 23:10.931
parent who would be supporting
these two little people.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.768
And I think it would break
Andy's heart to hear that

23:14.852 --> 23:18.647
I'm even considering that as
an option, but I can't help it.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.360
Does that make any sense
to you?

23:24.194 --> 23:25.112
[Andy] It does.

23:25.613 --> 23:26.864
[Vashti] What's going on
for you?

23:28.741 --> 23:30.326
Well, I knew all that was
going on.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.786
I know all that's going on,
hon. I'm your husband.

23:33.329 --> 23:36.540
I know you more than anyone.

23:38.417 --> 23:42.463
And I guess how I'm
getting through it is to,

23:44.298 --> 23:47.801
it's a trust thing.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.721
I'm just trusting, and...

23:52.222 --> 23:54.600
you know, in that space,
then anything is possible.

23:58.145 --> 24:01.649
And I just, it's hard
and unreasonable

24:01.732 --> 24:06.487
to ask anyone else to
trust as much as I do.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.783
I feel like there's
a lack of trust

24:10.866 --> 24:13.619
or something in me
and I'm not clear

24:13.702 --> 24:16.080
on what that is,
but it has me conflicted

24:16.163 --> 24:18.999
in how to support him
even though in my heart

24:19.083 --> 24:22.169
I know I support him fully
in whatever he chooses to do.

24:25.005 --> 24:28.384
I do trust that whatever
you do is the right thing

24:28.467 --> 24:30.761
and you just have to know I
support it whatever it is.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.264
As long as it doesn't harm
anybody else, I support it,

24:34.348 --> 24:35.891
and you just need to know that.

24:35.974 --> 24:36.809
[Andy] <i> Alright.</i>

24:36.892 --> 24:38.644
[screaming] Hey.

24:57.079 --> 25:00.916
<i>In something that's so</i>
<i>powerless and horrific </i>
<i>as cancer,</i>

25:00.999 --> 25:02.501
<i>you didn't choose to have it</i>

25:02.584 --> 25:04.294
<i>and there's no </i>
<i>getting out of it.</i>

25:04.378 --> 25:06.422
<i>There's no, like, "I just</i>
<i>don't want to do this anymore."</i>

25:11.844 --> 25:14.471
<i>And at the same time,</i>
<i>there's no one going,</i>

25:14.555 --> 25:15.848
"Let's just do this.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.141
<i>It's gonna kill cancer.</i>

25:17.433 --> 25:18.642
<i>It's gonna be okay."</i>

25:20.811 --> 25:22.688
<i>By the end of the day,</i>
<i>you've gotta make a call.</i>

25:24.231 --> 25:27.609
<i>And it's a big call to put</i>
<i>your faith in one camp.</i>

25:29.987 --> 25:31.071
<i>What if they're wrong?</i>

25:34.575 --> 25:36.744
<i>I think the way you navigate</i>
<i>through</i>

25:36.827 --> 25:38.912
<i>is to use your intuition.</i>

25:42.875 --> 25:44.042
<i>And then you have to dig deep</i>

25:44.126 --> 25:46.754
<i>and trust that the future is</i>
<i>bright.</i>

26:03.520 --> 26:06.190
So, I just had a profound...

26:09.443 --> 26:10.986
insight, feeling...

26:14.448 --> 26:15.783
and I'm going to India.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.244
Okay, so here we are.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.537
Where are we?

26:20.996 --> 26:25.584
Now, I'm gonna go all the
way on a plane to Delhi.

26:26.502 --> 26:29.213
[Vashti] And maybe show
Jesse where Grandpa Bob

26:29.296 --> 26:31.632
is coming from because Grandpa
Bob is going to visit Daddy.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.467
My dad, your granddad, is
coming from

26:33.550 --> 26:36.512
a little island in Wales,
there, straight to Delhi.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.430
[Jesse] Where does it say
Delhi?

26:38.514 --> 26:39.598
Right here.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.141
So, that's where
I'm going today.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.646
-Are you going to be okay?
-[Vashti] Love you.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.814
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Andy] Love you too.

26:46.897 --> 26:48.482
-I'm going to be fine.
-See you in three weeks.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.441
[Vashti] You will.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.628
Welcome to India. [laughs]

27:14.550 --> 27:15.634
<i>It's like a different planet.</i>

27:16.218 --> 27:18.595
<i>It's magical, beautiful,</i>
<i>colorful chaos.</i>

27:21.223 --> 27:24.226
[slow guitar music]

27:45.080 --> 27:45.956
I'm here.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.542
I start treatment tomorrow.
It feels amazing.

27:51.545 --> 27:52.713
There's nothing to fear.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.936
<i>I've had a bit of a battering</i>
<i>this year.</i>

28:09.104 --> 28:10.939
<i>I've had six rounds of chemo,</i>

28:11.315 --> 28:14.484
<i>and it's such a poisonous</i>
<i>treatment</i>

28:14.568 --> 28:16.445
<i>that kills your good cells </i>
<i>as well as,</i>

28:16.528 --> 28:17.738
<i>hopefully, the bad ones.</i>

28:20.490 --> 28:23.577
<i>So it's time to do something</i>
<i>cleansing.</i>

28:27.748 --> 28:29.791
<i>This is all kind of </i>
<i>5,000 year old,</i>

28:29.875 --> 28:33.420
<i>no side effects, slightly</i>
<i>magical medicine.</i>

28:36.590 --> 28:37.633
I'm losing some.

28:41.303 --> 28:45.515
<i>It's a perfectly natural way </i>
<i>of purifying the body, </i>

28:46.767 --> 28:49.311
<i>to help rebalance your system.</i>

28:53.690 --> 28:57.361
<i>And for me, that's a more of</i>
<i>inspiring form of treatment.</i>

29:07.454 --> 29:08.997
I'm very lucky to be here.

29:14.211 --> 29:15.128
My dad's coming soon.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.007
<i>I'm really </i>
<i>looking forward to it.</i>

29:24.513 --> 29:25.806
Welcome to India.

29:25.973 --> 29:26.974
How are you?

29:29.101 --> 29:30.519
What a journey.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.854
-How are you?
-I'm fine, you?

29:33.272 --> 29:34.606
-Good to see you.
-Looking good.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.900
I feel good, I feel good.

29:40.153 --> 29:43.156
[upbeat drum music]

29:57.838 --> 30:00.674
[Rob] <i>When I first heard </i>
<i>the path Andrew was taking,</i>

30:00.757 --> 30:05.887
<i>I was a little concerned</i>
<i>because I have a conditioned</i>
<i>prejudice</i>

30:05.971 --> 30:10.267
<i>that western approach is maybe</i>
<i>the only way that is available.</i>

30:12.477 --> 30:14.104
<i>But this is </i>
<i>what he wanted to do.</i>

30:15.939 --> 30:17.399
I think that's the one. Yes.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.652
[Rob] <i>And I hope that</i>
<i>he will come away feeling</i>

30:20.736 --> 30:25.282
<i>quite relaxed and ready for</i>
<i>the next step in the journey.</i>

30:47.679 --> 30:50.849
Today I'm going to see
the Indian astrologer

30:50.932 --> 30:54.102
and he's going to, he's
going to look at my life.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.606
<i>I just have to tell them </i>
<i>where I was born</i>

30:57.689 --> 30:59.274
<i>and at what time and what date,</i>

30:59.691 --> 31:02.944
<i>and then they can calculate</i>
<i>my journey.</i>

31:05.655 --> 31:07.574
-This is your horoscope.
-Okay.

31:07.824 --> 31:11.203
Your ascendant is Capricorn.

31:11.912 --> 31:16.083
According to medical astrology,
you were born in Capricorn.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.000
[Andy] Okay.

31:17.084 --> 31:20.003
[Pandit] And your moon sign
is Virgo.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.632
-Gemini sign.
-[Andy] Gemini?

31:23.715 --> 31:25.634
Yes, Gemini, Virgo.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.344
-[Andy] My wife is Gemini.
-Then good.

31:27.636 --> 31:28.887
She is very good for you.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.348
Gemini, Virgo, Taurus.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.392
-My son is Taurus.
-Very good.

31:33.725 --> 31:37.979
Your path is exalted in the
ascendant.

31:38.397 --> 31:43.276
It means you are a very
courageous and bold person

31:46.780 --> 31:49.408
and now I will tell about
the sixth house,

31:49.533 --> 31:50.951
about your health.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.665
The lord of sixth house,
Mercury,

31:57.457 --> 32:00.293
in tenth house
with Sun and Venus.

32:01.545 --> 32:05.382
The sun, the planet is
weak in your horoscope.

32:06.508 --> 32:10.011
It shows little difficult time
for health.

32:12.222 --> 32:14.850
This is, it looks a little bit
serious.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.018
Wow.

32:19.146 --> 32:22.899
That may create short life.

32:29.739 --> 32:32.159
[Andy sighs]

32:33.452 --> 32:36.872
In my opinion,
I think you will overcome.

32:42.919 --> 32:43.879
Good.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.424
There is more support from
the planet, and if you pass

32:47.507 --> 32:51.678
these two years, then you
will have lot of good things.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.726
-Okay.
-[Pandit] Any question?

32:57.809 --> 33:02.606
I have a question around,
because in Australia,

33:02.939 --> 33:05.525
they do chemotherapy.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.444
Yes, you have to do little bit

33:07.527 --> 33:09.821
this kind of treatment,
chemotherapy.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.160
Thank you.

33:15.243 --> 33:18.288
I think, yes, in my opinion,
this shows

33:18.371 --> 33:20.790
some difficult time for
you, but you will overcome

33:20.874 --> 33:22.709
because there
is nature support.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.462
-Ah, I'll take that.
-That shows you long life.

33:25.545 --> 33:26.963
-I'll take that.
-Somehow.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.092
He thinks I'll be okay.
Oh, god.

33:32.636 --> 33:33.470
But...

33:55.534 --> 33:56.576
He says maybe...

33:59.829 --> 34:03.625
two or three years of...
you know, a struggle.

34:07.796 --> 34:08.838
[sighs]

34:12.342 --> 34:13.176
Wow.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.440
<i>I already knew that the</i>
<i>next year was going to be</i>

34:28.525 --> 34:31.235
<i>kind of tough with treatment</i>
<i>and recovery.</i>

34:31.402 --> 34:33.612
And I guess the whole point of
the chart

34:33.697 --> 34:35.322
in astrology is to...

34:36.992 --> 34:39.494
to avoid the danger
that's not yet come.

34:39.578 --> 34:40.704
That's what they keep saying.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.789
"To avoid the danger
that has not yet come."

34:53.257 --> 34:55.217
<i>People have always been</i>
<i>talking to me about</i>

34:55.302 --> 34:56.886
<i>don't paddle upstream,</i>

34:58.263 --> 34:59.806
<i>you know? Go with the flow.</i>

35:00.015 --> 35:01.516
<i>And I was like, </i>
<i>"I totally get that."</i>

35:01.600 --> 35:04.227
<i>But it wasn't until I was</i>
<i>actually in the Ganges</i>

35:04.853 --> 35:06.062
<i>that I sort of went...</i>

35:08.189 --> 35:10.108
<i>"Of course.</i>
<i>It's going that way, anyway.</i>

35:10.191 --> 35:11.276
<i>Go with it."</i>

35:13.987 --> 35:17.324
<i>And if there's a rock, </i>
<i>paddle around it.</i>

35:19.075 --> 35:21.244
<i>As it comes up, </i>
<i>you can see the danger</i>

35:21.328 --> 35:23.121
<i>and you can navigate around it.</i>

35:23.622 --> 35:26.082
<i>And so it was a really nice</i>
<i>thing to go,</i>

35:26.666 --> 35:28.209
<i>"I'm just going to go </i>
<i>with the flow."</i>

35:31.212 --> 35:33.632
<i>You can't be questioning why.</i>

35:33.798 --> 35:37.177
<i>Just accept the things you</i>
<i>can't change</i>

35:37.260 --> 35:39.929
<i>and do something about </i>
<i>the things you can.</i>

[soft piano music]

[Rob] <i>The whole experience </i>
<i>from my point of view</i>

35:56.112 --> 35:57.364
<i>was quite surprising.</i>

35:57.656 --> 36:00.909
I feel, personally,
so much better

36:00.992 --> 36:02.994
than when I came
that I have to believe

36:03.078 --> 36:05.622
that it's done the same
for him.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.587
[Andy] <i>I didn't want to do</i>
<i>chemotherapy for a long time.</i>

36:12.671 --> 36:13.797
See you soon.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.675
<i>But my destiny has assured</i>
<i>whatever I do.</i>

36:16.758 --> 36:19.135
<i>I'll do the chemotherapy</i>
<i>to kill the cancer</i>

36:19.386 --> 36:20.762
<i>and I will use </i>
<i>everything I've learned</i>

36:20.845 --> 36:23.473
<i>along the way </i>
<i>to rebalance me</i>

36:23.807 --> 36:25.934
<i>and to help me </i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

36:28.019 --> 36:29.437
It'll be interesting to see
how it goes

36:29.521 --> 36:31.022
when I get home, back in...

36:34.776 --> 36:39.030
back in the mentalness
of the west.

36:55.296 --> 36:57.799
It's Friday, day one of chemo.

37:00.009 --> 37:01.678
I'm going to be here
for four days now.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.222
Well, five including
yesterday, last night.

37:05.682 --> 37:09.644
And I've just realized
there's been no joy

37:09.728 --> 37:13.064
until my gorgeous wife
arrives and we have a giggle.

37:14.149 --> 37:18.486
[Vashti] You can press up,
and down, and up and down.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.530
-How are your abs?
-Burning.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.323
[Vashti] You could have
a six pack

37:22.407 --> 37:24.242
by the end of your chemo.
[laughs]

37:24.951 --> 37:26.828
-Anyway.
-Where are we going?

37:26.911 --> 37:28.747
Just up here behind that
traffic light.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.130
Look at how many
holes I've got.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.758
I know, I just, looking
at your punctured,

37:39.841 --> 37:41.426
kind of pin cushioned arms.

37:42.135 --> 37:43.678
Ugh, I've got fucking holes
everywhere.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.807
Will you promise that you won't
wake me up every three hours

37:47.891 --> 37:50.101
and take my temperature
and blood pressure tonight?

37:50.435 --> 37:51.269
No.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.147
I will be expecting you to do
your husbandly duties, though.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.106
What's that?

37:55.398 --> 37:56.691
[laughs]

37:57.859 --> 37:59.986
It's those actions that you
have to do

38:00.069 --> 38:02.155
so that your wife doesn't
get herself a lover.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.240
Probably you just get a lover.

I'll be on my nausea pills.

[Vashti] Alright, darling.
Welcome home.

38:18.588 --> 38:19.506
[Andy] Home.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.553
Now you've got to be
gentle to daddy bear.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.306
Poor daddy.

38:31.518 --> 38:34.229
Listen, very gentle,
but big kisses for Daddy

38:34.312 --> 38:35.688

[Andy] Give me a cuddle.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.651
[Jesse] Can I see your arm?

38:39.734 --> 38:40.860
It's all gone, though.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.615
[Vashti] Come on, then.

38:45.698 --> 38:46.908
Let's go and get into bed.

[Indigo] Good night.

-Night, guys. Love you.
-Daddy will be sleeping now.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.424
It's good to have him home.

39:03.508 --> 39:07.387
But I do feel a tiny
sense of anxiety

39:07.470 --> 39:10.723
about the fact
that I am going to be

39:10.807 --> 39:14.227
looking after him and I don't
know how he's going to be.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.218
[exhales heavily]

39:52.724 --> 39:55.643
<i>I have no idea where</i>
<i>the last week has gone.</i>

40:00.189 --> 40:02.817
<i>I had some reaction to...</i>

40:03.359 --> 40:04.944
<i>one of the drugs.</i>

40:07.614 --> 40:09.699
<i>I literally lost my mind.</i>

40:13.286 --> 40:16.080
<i>I spent three or four days</i>
<i>just...</i>

40:17.540 --> 40:19.334
<i>talking myself off a roof.</i>

40:23.546 --> 40:26.007
<i>And I descended </i>
<i>into the darkest,</i>

40:27.342 --> 40:31.095
<i>most bleak depression,</i>

40:33.932 --> 40:36.684
<i>and I could not see </i>
<i>an end to it.</i>

He couldn't really share
a conversation properly,

40:52.367 --> 40:53.785
didn't know what he wanted
and he was actually,

40:53.868 --> 40:56.746
I don't know if he realized,
but really quite aggressive.

40:56.829 --> 40:57.830
And, uh.

40:57.914 --> 40:59.248
[Andy] I really don't remember
anything.

40:59.332 --> 41:02.126
Angry and said quite a
few strange things to me.

41:03.419 --> 41:07.090
When we spoke to the doctor,
he said it's a totally

41:07.507 --> 41:10.134
unknown, unheard of reaction

41:10.802 --> 41:13.846
and that there's no way
they could foresee it

41:13.930 --> 41:17.767
and so we're not going
to do it again.

41:17.850 --> 41:22.021
So we're going to go back
to the old mixture of chemo.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.944
You've got a brilliant knack
of phoning at the worst time.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.320
At the moment, I have to say.

41:31.030 --> 41:34.409
I tried to call you last
night several times.

41:35.159 --> 41:35.994
So...

41:37.078 --> 41:41.666
So it's been a weird couple
days and it feels like

41:41.749 --> 41:45.503
we're sort of seeing the light,
and yeah.

41:45.712 --> 41:49.549
So yeah, and I'm in
a sort of slightly

41:49.632 --> 41:52.010
peculiar resistant place,
at the moment, to it all.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.595
Well, I'm not. I'm not.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.723
And at the moment, I feel
like a fucking crap wife

41:56.806 --> 41:59.684
and a horrible mum
and a selfish person

41:59.767 --> 42:01.769
with horrible thoughts
going on in my head.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.604
Yeah.

42:04.647 --> 42:05.940
[crying]

42:07.025 --> 42:08.192
No, I don't want that.

42:08.276 --> 42:10.319
I don't, I never say,
"Why is this happening?"

42:10.403 --> 42:12.363
I just want more fucking time.

42:12.447 --> 42:15.742
I need some time
to take it all in.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.746
It's just been really full on.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.372
I'm very torn.

42:22.665 --> 42:23.666
So torn.

42:24.459 --> 42:26.794
It's very easy to go, "Fuck!

42:26.878 --> 42:30.548
I've got cancer,
I've got cancer!

42:30.631 --> 42:31.591
I could die."

42:31.674 --> 42:35.011
And why me and feeling angry

42:35.094 --> 42:38.848
and seeing people
everywhere going,

42:38.931 --> 42:41.184
"Why are they worried
about a pimple

42:41.267 --> 42:44.228
they've got on their face
or a poor guy's

42:44.312 --> 42:47.356
broken his leg and he won't
be a triathlete anymore,

42:49.650 --> 42:52.278
and I've got cancer."

42:55.364 --> 42:56.657
Anyway, I'm fine, Mum.

42:56.741 --> 42:57.742
Don't freak out.

42:57.825 --> 43:00.661
I just knew I'd fall
apart when I spoke to you.

43:02.622 --> 43:04.415
I love you too. [sobbing]

43:11.506 --> 43:14.258
My mum's coming from Wales.

43:16.969 --> 43:21.766
It'll be good to have her
here, have her around,

43:21.849 --> 43:23.601
and she's tough.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.103
She's tough, my mum.

43:26.187 --> 43:29.357
And it will take some pressure
off Vashti

43:29.440 --> 43:33.569
because I'm conscious that
Vashti's trying to manage

43:33.861 --> 43:35.530
the children and me.

43:37.198 --> 43:38.866
<i>Sometimes you just </i>
<i>need your mum.</i>

43:42.370 --> 43:45.289
[slow piano music]

44:22.034 --> 44:24.579
[Vashti] <i>I feel so torn </i>
<i>in so many different ways</i>

44:27.957 --> 44:30.459
because I'm trying to
look after my children,

44:30.751 --> 44:32.211
<i>give them the love </i>
<i>they need,</i>

44:34.964 --> 44:36.757
<i>and at the same time,</i>

44:36.966 --> 44:39.635
<i>I'm trying to support</i>
<i>Andy when he's feeling</i>

44:39.719 --> 44:43.306
<i>confused or completely lost.</i>

44:48.853 --> 44:52.106
<i>This has been a big smack</i>
<i>in the chops for both of us.</i>

44:54.025 --> 44:56.736
<i>We're just both in</i>
<i>transition of being ready</i>

44:56.819 --> 44:59.196
<i>for what this journey is</i>
<i>about, which is a lot more</i>

44:59.280 --> 45:01.240
<i>intense than we expected, </i>
<i>I think.</i>

45:07.455 --> 45:09.206
<i>But I'm really hoping </i>
<i>that will change</i>

45:09.290 --> 45:11.208
<i>when Andy's mum comes </i>
<i>to the rescue.</i>

45:15.338 --> 45:17.423
Hey, guys. Grandma is here.

45:17.506 --> 45:18.341
Grandma.

45:23.179 --> 45:24.472
Hi, dear.

45:26.349 --> 45:27.725
-Hi.
-How are you, Mum?

45:27.808 --> 45:29.977
-It's lovely to see you.
-You too.

45:30.978 --> 45:32.104
How are you?

45:32.188 --> 45:33.689
-How are you feeling today?
-I'm good, I'm doing well.

45:34.523 --> 45:35.441
Oh, good.

45:38.319 --> 45:40.029
So I understand
he feels better.

45:40.112 --> 45:41.697
Yeah, you're catching him like

45:41.781 --> 45:43.824
on the first really,
really good day.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.409
[Pat] <i>I hope that </i>
<i>while I'm here,</i>

45:45.868 --> 45:51.082
I can support Vashti, do
lots with the children

45:51.165 --> 45:53.334
who are a delight
and make you forget.

45:54.001 --> 45:56.671
I think these ones bend
the other way, don't they?

45:56.754 --> 45:57.838
They bend backwards.

45:57.922 --> 46:01.717
[Pat] <i>I hope I can, </i>
<i>in the smallest way, </i>
<i>make a difference.</i>

46:02.259 --> 46:03.761
You've got a genius child,
do you know?

46:03.844 --> 46:04.720
I know.

46:05.304 --> 46:08.599
Just support and love
and be there.

46:10.851 --> 46:13.229
What would you like done
with your hair today, love?

46:13.312 --> 46:15.564
Going somewhere nice
for the holidays?

46:15.731 --> 46:17.900
Something practical.

46:18.442 --> 46:20.695
Summery, cool and...

46:21.362 --> 46:22.196
And shorter.

46:22.321 --> 46:23.614
Stylish, please.

46:25.950 --> 46:28.035
I came over with slightly
mixed feelings

46:28.703 --> 46:32.665
because it wasn't
what you want.

46:33.249 --> 46:35.751
But it's a good time.

46:35.835 --> 46:37.086
I think if you have
to look at that

46:37.169 --> 46:39.088
and know that you're actually
going to get a lot out of it,

46:39.171 --> 46:42.508
and a special time.

46:50.725 --> 46:53.394
[playful music]

46:56.981 --> 46:58.733
[Jesse] I'm gonna decorate
the tree.

46:58.816 --> 46:59.650
[Andy] Show me.

46:59.734 --> 47:01.235
Do one. There you go.

47:04.613 --> 47:05.823
Well done, Indi.

47:08.617 --> 47:09.452
Hi.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.178
[Vashti] <i>Andy was booked in </i>
<i>to go in for chemo</i>

47:27.261 --> 47:31.223
<i>and he got there </i>
<i>and they decided</i>

47:31.307 --> 47:32.683
<i>that what they were going to do</i>

47:32.767 --> 47:36.937
<i>is run a scan to make sure</i>
<i>there were no surprises.</i>

47:38.230 --> 47:40.900
<i>The result was that </i>
<i>there was nothing new</i>

47:41.650 --> 47:46.614
and that the original
lymphoma had at least halved,

47:47.490 --> 47:49.617
which is a fantastic sign
because it means

47:49.700 --> 47:51.744
he's responding
to the treatment.

47:52.369 --> 47:54.080
Nearly, nearly, nearly.

47:54.914 --> 47:55.998
Run with the ball.

48:00.544 --> 48:04.215
I can't wait to go in
and get round two done

48:06.258 --> 48:09.970
because it's working
and as strange as it is,

48:10.638 --> 48:14.892
<i>to be in a ward 24/7,</i>
<i>hooked up to a machine,</i>

48:15.643 --> 48:19.814
<i>and I just went to get in,</i>
<i>get this cancer killed off.</i>

48:20.773 --> 48:21.941
[Vashti] Hi, boys.

48:23.192 --> 48:25.111
What are you doing here today,
Jesse?

48:25.194 --> 48:27.363
I got a new,
something to do today.

48:27.446 --> 48:28.781
[Vashti] Is that your new
cuddly toy?

48:29.073 --> 48:30.658
-Him?
-[Jesse] What have you got?

48:36.747 --> 48:39.875
<i>I came out of the second lot</i>
<i>of chemo.</i>

48:41.168 --> 48:42.294
<i>And it's not too bad.</i>

48:42.378 --> 48:44.922
Like I feel, I feel fine.

48:45.089 --> 48:48.259
And I, I look really well.

48:49.927 --> 48:51.595
Now, they'll collect
stem cells.

48:55.599 --> 48:56.517
Here it comes.

48:57.017 --> 48:58.394
<i>And sometime after Christmas,</i>

48:58.477 --> 49:02.940
<i>I'll go in and, hopefully,</i>
<i>I'm in remission.</i>

49:03.566 --> 49:06.861
<i>Assuming I am, I'll then do</i>
<i>the stem cell transplant.</i>

49:07.236 --> 49:09.405
<i>And then the stem cell</i>
<i>transplant wipes out</i>

49:09.488 --> 49:11.198
<i>any underlying disease.</i>

49:12.116 --> 49:13.450
<i>This is gonna be the end of it.</i>

49:23.294 --> 49:26.172
Now, I want to look at
all your gorgeous faces.

49:28.382 --> 49:29.884
[all] Cheers!

49:29.967 --> 49:30.885
Happy New Year.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.678
To another year of adventure.

49:33.888 --> 49:35.472
Come on, give me a kiss.

49:36.891 --> 49:39.101
And slightly less drama,
but drama of a different kind.

49:39.185 --> 49:41.604
-Yes.
-Maybe a thriller film drama.

49:41.687 --> 49:42.521
Maybe.

49:44.857 --> 49:46.192
[Vashti] Look at that.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.278
[Andy] <i>In some aspects, this</i>
<i>was the best year of my life.</i>

49:52.156 --> 49:54.867
<i>And for all the downsides </i>
<i>of treatment,</i>

49:54.950 --> 49:58.204
<i>there was all the joy of being</i>
<i>at home,</i>

49:59.872 --> 50:01.957
<i>and being with my kids </i>
<i>and my wife.</i>

50:04.376 --> 50:05.878
<i>With the turning </i>
<i>of the new year,</i>

50:05.961 --> 50:09.548
<i>I just get excited </i>
<i>about getting through</i>

50:09.632 --> 50:13.510
<i>treatment and surviving cancer.</i>

50:23.020 --> 50:24.396
[crowd chattering]

50:26.023 --> 50:27.316
[man] So are you
excited for the premiere?

50:27.399 --> 50:30.194
Yeah, I am.
I guess this is the first.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.654
I mean, we've all seen it
and we love it,

50:31.737 --> 50:33.530
so it's kind of nice
that we get a chance

50:33.614 --> 50:36.158
to finally share it
after all the hard work.

50:38.410 --> 50:41.830
<i>This time last year, </i>
<i>I was the lead</i>

50:41.914 --> 50:44.917
<i>of a big successful </i>
<i>American TV series.</i>

50:47.253 --> 50:50.381
<i>After much effort</i>
<i>and sacrifice,</i>

50:52.007 --> 50:54.218
<i>I finally got to</i>
<i>where I wanted to be.</i>

50:57.137 --> 51:00.891
I don't remember like a
career counselor going,

51:00.975 --> 51:03.852
"So what do, you know,
what is it you wanna do?"

51:04.895 --> 51:07.147
I don't remember any of that.
I just remember someone saying,

51:07.231 --> 51:08.691
"You need to go to university.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.026
"Pick something."

51:12.278 --> 51:15.239
And the guy across the
road was an engineer.

51:16.198 --> 51:18.701
<i>So I did engineering and</i>
<i>I did that for 15 years.</i>

51:21.370 --> 51:25.708
<i>And then one day, some</i>
<i>girl grabbed me in a cafe</i>

51:26.041 --> 51:28.085
<i>and she said, </i>
<i>"Who's your agent?"</i>

51:28.377 --> 51:30.254
<i>I was like, </i>
<i>"I don't have an agent."</i>

51:30.337 --> 51:31.964
<i>And she said, </i>
<i>"I'm a photographer.</i>

51:32.047 --> 51:33.924
<i>I want...</i>
<i>can I take your picture?"</i>

51:35.175 --> 51:38.429
<i>And that ended up in a magazine</i>
<i>and then I was a model.</i>

51:43.642 --> 51:45.269
[Vashti] <i>He kind of</i>
<i>stepped into modeling,</i>

51:45.352 --> 51:47.354
<i>was hugely successful </i>
<i>very quickly.</i>

51:48.647 --> 51:50.774
<i>And he was at one point</i>
<i>the highest used model</i>

51:50.858 --> 51:52.776
<i>for Australian TV commercials.</i>

51:58.449 --> 52:01.243
<i>And then little parts in</i>
<i>TV started showing up.</i>

52:06.665 --> 52:08.625
Excuse me, I'm looking for
Pam Horman.

52:08.709 --> 52:10.419
These are her boys.
They're here to see their dad.

52:10.794 --> 52:13.255
There wasn't enough work
to give up my engineering.

52:13.339 --> 52:14.798
<i>So I balanced it</i>
<i>for a couple of years.</i>

52:14.882 --> 52:16.008
[woman] Mr. Lee?

52:16.800 --> 52:19.219
I've got investors
arriving in half an hour

52:19.303 --> 52:21.430
and they're supposed to have
publicity material,

52:21.513 --> 52:24.350
which your secretarial services
was supposed to
have printed out.

52:24.433 --> 52:25.476
I see.

52:25.559 --> 52:27.269
Then I'd take a month off
and go to LA

52:27.353 --> 52:30.230
and try and get something big.

52:30.314 --> 52:31.523
Jane Porter.

52:31.899 --> 52:32.900
I am Tarzan.

52:34.193 --> 52:37.446
Do you think I'd go for
a skinny bitch like you?

52:37.863 --> 52:39.323
[director] And we're rolling.

52:39.448 --> 52:40.532
[woman] Reacts to camera?

52:41.617 --> 52:45.621
[Andy]
<i>And then Vashti fell pregnant</i>
<i>and I sort of realized,</i>

52:45.704 --> 52:47.748
"Oh, my god, I've got to
provide for everybody now."

52:47.831 --> 52:49.833
You know, like my wife's
not going to be working,

52:51.293 --> 52:53.587
and I just thought
I'm just gonna

52:53.670 --> 52:55.464
put acting on the back burner.

52:55.547 --> 52:58.050
And then literally the
next day, my agent rang

52:58.133 --> 52:59.468
<i>and said they've got </i>
<i>an audition.</i>

52:59.718 --> 53:02.012
[woman] I have no
desire to fight you, Gabriel.

53:02.221 --> 53:03.639
Shoot me if you must,
but I beg you,

53:03.722 --> 53:05.349
hear what I have to say first.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.017
You lie.

53:07.351 --> 53:09.061
I never trust your kind.

53:11.021 --> 53:12.189
[Andy] <i>They rang the next day</i>
<i>and said,</i>

53:12.272 --> 53:14.149
<i>"They've offered you </i>
<i>the lead role in this movie.</i>

53:14.566 --> 53:16.026
<i>But it's not paid."</i>

53:17.778 --> 53:20.239
And I was like, "Great."

53:21.490 --> 53:22.950
<i>"There's no way I can do it."</i>

53:25.828 --> 53:29.665
<i>And then Vashti said, "What</i>
<i>would you rather tell your son?</i>

53:29.748 --> 53:32.835
That you didn't do this thing
you've been trying to do

53:32.918 --> 53:35.295
for years because of money

53:36.422 --> 53:37.923
or that you just did it
anyway?"

53:38.841 --> 53:39.675
And...

53:41.468 --> 53:42.469
So I just did it.

53:42.553 --> 53:43.846
[Amitiel] Gabe?

53:44.805 --> 53:45.806
It's my fault.

53:47.975 --> 53:48.892
Gabe?

53:49.435 --> 53:51.895
You gotta talk to me.
Listen, you gotta talk to me.

53:51.979 --> 53:53.147
Gabe! Listen.

53:53.230 --> 53:54.106
No!

53:54.815 --> 53:56.817
-Look at you!
-You don't understand!

53:57.192 --> 54:00.028
[Andy] <i>From that, I got an</i>
<i>American agent and manager</i>

54:00.112 --> 54:04.867
and flew to America
and a year later
I had <i>Spartacus.</i>

54:10.497 --> 54:13.500
<i>Nine months filming </i>
<i>and a six-year deal.</i>

54:16.170 --> 54:18.088
<i>You know, I had offers, </i>
<i>film offers.</i>

54:19.047 --> 54:20.591
<i>Didn't have to </i>
<i>audition anymore</i>

54:21.800 --> 54:24.178
<i>I was planning </i>
<i>the next career move.</i>

54:24.970 --> 54:27.222
<i>All that effort </i>
<i>of trying to make it.</i>

54:27.598 --> 54:28.432
<i>I was set.</i>

54:37.232 --> 54:40.360
<i>And I've been kind of mourning</i>
<i>the loss of that victory,</i>

54:40.444 --> 54:43.489
<i>if you'd like, </i>
<i>because this lymphoma</i>

54:44.364 --> 54:45.908
<i>is still not in remission.</i>

54:51.288 --> 54:52.789
<i>My mind's going crazy.</i>

54:53.040 --> 54:55.959
I just don't know what my fate
is for the next little while.

54:59.338 --> 55:00.672
[sighs]

55:02.424 --> 55:03.425
I feel sick.

55:08.722 --> 55:12.392
I got you some DVDs
to choose from.

55:12.476 --> 55:17.147
Got <i>Mad Men 3, </i>
<i>Sunshine Cleaning,</i>

55:17.231 --> 55:18.982
which is a really cute
funny film.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.946
Had a PET scan yesterday
and that was to

55:24.279 --> 55:28.659
show that everything was in
remission and I could go on

55:28.742 --> 55:32.579
and do the next stage, which
was the bone marrow transplant.

55:33.539 --> 55:36.333
We got a call this morning
from the specialist's secretary

55:36.416 --> 55:37.960
saying, "You better come in.

55:38.794 --> 55:40.837
He wants to talk
about your results."

55:41.547 --> 55:42.673
Is that enough?

55:44.007 --> 55:45.384
-What, for a week?
-Yeah.

55:45.467 --> 55:46.301
Yeah.

55:46.385 --> 55:49.763
[Andy] <i>In a nutshell, all the</i>
<i>original lymphoma was gone,</i>

55:50.138 --> 55:53.016
<i>except this new area, which</i>
<i>was never there before.</i>

55:55.727 --> 55:59.773
I just don't know
what's ahead now.

56:00.983 --> 56:02.568
You know, is it
one round of chemo?

56:02.651 --> 56:05.821
Is it another round?
Is it, what is it?

56:06.655 --> 56:09.533
It's unusual for lymphoma
to respond

56:09.616 --> 56:12.327
in one part
and grow in another.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.163
<i>We've got to find a cunning</i>
<i>way of treating this.</i>

56:23.589 --> 56:27.509
[Andy]
<i>It wasn't until I got to</i>
<i>the ward that Professor Gibson</i>

56:27.593 --> 56:31.513
<i>said, "We need to knock this </i>
<i>on the head.</i>

56:34.391 --> 56:36.602
<i>This drug that we're</i>
<i>going to give you now</i>

56:38.270 --> 56:42.232
<i>specifically targets</i>
<i>really fast growing stuff.</i>

56:43.317 --> 56:44.651
<i>You're going to be here </i>
<i>for ten days.</i>

56:45.277 --> 56:47.237
<i>This is the big guns now.</i>

56:49.448 --> 56:51.908
<i>If you're not having response</i>
<i>to this kind of chemo,</i>

56:51.992 --> 56:53.952
<i>then nothing else is</i>
<i>really going to work."</i>

56:56.371 --> 56:58.248
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>anyone mentioned that.</i>

56:59.666 --> 57:02.127
<i>Before, it was an easy case </i>
<i>for him</i>

57:02.461 --> 57:06.048
<i>and now it feels like it's</i>
<i>getting more of his attention.</i>

57:17.935 --> 57:20.437
I'm having a high dose
chemo now.

57:21.313 --> 57:22.230
I'm really feeling it.

57:23.023 --> 57:24.691
I've already got some ulcers.

57:27.903 --> 57:30.781
I mean, whose mouth is that?

57:32.366 --> 57:33.909
I just don't recognize it.

57:35.118 --> 57:39.081
Gums are all receding
and kind of raw,

57:41.291 --> 57:45.295
and I guess my stomach,
as well, is trashed

57:45.379 --> 57:47.506
and I've got this rash.

57:47.756 --> 57:50.634
I can see it all over my body,

57:51.969 --> 57:54.554
which is kind of chemo heat.

57:56.264 --> 57:59.685
And, I just feel sorry
for my body, for my cells.

58:00.143 --> 58:01.937
They're taking
such a battering.

58:05.732 --> 58:08.568
<i>So hopefully this big hit</i>
<i>will get it under control</i>

58:09.111 --> 58:11.405
<i>and we'll get back on</i>
<i>track for the transplant.</i>

58:15.200 --> 58:19.413
Ah, I can smell some children.

58:19.788 --> 58:20.998
Oh!

58:22.624 --> 58:23.458
[Indigo] Daddy!

58:23.750 --> 58:24.668
Hello!

58:25.377 --> 58:27.963
[Vashti] Aw, is it your daddy?

58:28.296 --> 58:29.506
Hello, beautiful children.

58:29.589 --> 58:31.550
-That's you.
-That's me?

58:32.050 --> 58:34.052
[Vashti] Aw, it looks just
like you.

58:34.219 --> 58:35.971
I've got one hair left
on my chin.

58:36.179 --> 58:37.723
That is prefect, Indi.

58:37.806 --> 58:39.224
-Thank you.
-[Vashti] Well done.

58:39.307 --> 58:41.685
-That's beautiful.
-[Vashti] Hello, Jesse Red.

58:41.768 --> 58:43.020
Hello, can I have a cuddle?

58:43.854 --> 58:45.397
Daddy, daddy, daddy.

58:45.689 --> 58:47.649
Oh, I've missed you guys.

58:49.568 --> 58:50.652
What've you been up to?

58:50.736 --> 58:52.612
You been looking after everyone
for me?

58:53.864 --> 58:55.157
[Indigo] I missed you, daddy.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.658
I missed you, too.

58:58.368 --> 59:01.413
<i>I really should be </i>
<i>in remission by now,</i>

59:03.206 --> 59:06.376
<i>but treatment's dragged</i>
<i>on for nearly a year.</i>

59:07.127 --> 59:11.381
And that's sometimes
a bit of a heavy burden,

59:13.050 --> 59:14.009
for everyone.

59:14.968 --> 59:16.428
That's you fat.

59:16.511 --> 59:17.846
That's me fat?

59:18.722 --> 59:22.517
And I have no body, just a
fat head with arms and legs?

59:23.185 --> 59:24.227
It does look like me.

59:24.311 --> 59:26.229
You've got a body.

59:26.772 --> 59:27.981
Yeah, I have.

59:28.482 --> 59:31.401
<i>I don't know what effect</i>
<i>it's having on the children.</i>

59:32.360 --> 59:35.072
<i>But you know, I'm sort of</i>
<i>realizing more and more</i>

59:35.155 --> 59:37.657
that they're incredibly
perceptive kids anyway.

59:38.658 --> 59:41.536
And we sort of, I've been
broaching the subject of,

59:42.079 --> 59:44.289
I never actually
mentioned the word cancer.

59:44.623 --> 59:47.834
<i>I've said, "I have a</i>
<i>problem with my blood."</i>

59:47.918 --> 59:51.088
<i>Or "My blood needs</i>
<i>replacing" or "needs fixing."</i>

59:51.338 --> 59:54.341
You know, it's a sort
of semi-serious context,

59:54.424 --> 59:56.551
but, "hey don't worry,
I'm gonna be fine."

59:57.469 --> 59:59.387
Hey, Jesse Red,
what's happening?

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.473
How was your week?

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.142
Good.
Thank you very much.

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:05.519
How was yours?

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:07.646
Very good, thanks.

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:09.689
Thank you for asking.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:13.735
I think with kids, as long
as what they're seeing

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:15.612
matches
what they're being told,

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.615
it's kind of easy to
understand and go along with.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:19.825
Okay, I'm just going to shave.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.451
[Jesse] Okay.

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:25.831
[Indigo] What are you
doing with your hair?

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:27.290
He's just taking his hair

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:28.917
because the medicine's
making it come out.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.877
Look at that.
Nice big clump.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:32.963
[Indigo] It's coming off?

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.381
Yeah, I'm having a hair cut.

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.591
Do you want me to
cut your hair off, too?

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:37.509
[Indigo] No.

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:39.261
No, I'm only joking.

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:41.805
I asked Indi if I could
have her hair for a bit.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:42.931
[Vashti] No.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:46.935
[Andy] <i>We're all in it </i>
<i>together and getting</i>

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.562
<i>through it as a family.</i>

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.438
Go into bed.
Lie down.

01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:52.482
And you can hear the story.

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:56.653
[Andy] <i>And of course, </i>
<i>my mum's been</i>
<i>so brilliant and supportive.</i>

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:58.947
She's been here
for four months.

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:01.700
And, of course,
the treatment's

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:03.201
gone much longer
than we'd hope.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.495
So her trip's been extended.

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:07.372
So my dad's coming out
tomorrow.

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:10.125
Alright, I think it's time
to tuck you both in bed.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.668
I'm really looking
forward to seeing him.

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:14.171
I'm really excited
about having him around.

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:20.218
I need that please.

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:21.511
Do you think
you might need some more?

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:22.888
I need that please.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.016
Grandpa, grandpa!

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:29.644
[Andy] <i>It's another great gift</i>
<i>of this whole journey.</i>

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:31.354
Good to see you.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.356
How are you?

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.108
-I'm fine, I'm good.
-[Vashti] Hello.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.526
Let me be useful.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.736
She's the man of the house
these days.

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:39.154
I'm the man of the house
at the moment.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:50.749
[indistinct chattering]

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:01.885
Read me your email.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:03.678
-[Vashti] Are you sure?
-Yeah.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.055
"Hello, lovely folk.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.348
It's another spectacular,
hot, clear day

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:08.391
in Sydney, the kind
of day you English folk

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.435
are dreaming of,
but in all honesty,

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.811
we're longing for the autumn.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.897
Andy's doing really well
and in the midst

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.815
of an additional couple rounds
of chemo.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:18.401
He's sitting, strumming
on his beautiful guitar

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:20.946
with a big smile on his
face, which is partly to do

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:22.530
with the fact that
this morning he woke up

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:25.450
with a massive boner, the
first one for a wee while.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.410
So, in truth, we're both
smiling.

01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:28.787
That's all for now.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.163
Sending you lots of love.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.832
Keep the updates coming
and your lives rolling in

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:35.627
as it's nice to be connected
with people off this island."

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.796
Well, thank you for sharing
my morning boner with...

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:41.258
-Hundreds of friends.
-Millions.

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:44.886
Okay, that's sent.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:49.599
But I haven't sent out
updates for so long now

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:54.145
just because, I didn't have
anything to say,
in all honesty.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:56.523
I was just trying to process
everything.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.525
[Andy] What's different?

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:01.695
I just, I just think,
for me, it was like...

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.867
I just feel so much
calmer and more grounded.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.912
I just, I think readjusting
my perspective

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:15.542
and re-framing that life
right now is about this.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.044
Yeah, you seem a lot better.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:23.258
You seem so, more, more
grounded I guess.

01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:25.051
This is just what it is.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.431
Right here, right now is
today and enjoying today.

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:43.111
[Vashti] <i> I've just felt like </i>
<i>I'm trying to</i>

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:44.821
<i>speed track this treatment </i>
<i>so that we can</i>

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:46.448
<i>just get on with our lives.</i>

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:51.828
<i>But the most conflicting</i>
<i>thing is to fight against it.</i>

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:58.209
<i>And, ultimately, I just</i>
<i>have to be there for Andy,</i>

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:04.591
<i>which is why we chose to</i>
<i>walk the earth together.</i>

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.811
<i>When I first met Andy, </i>
<i>I was at university</i>

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:19.314
<i>and it was one of those</i>
<i>summers backpacking</i>

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:22.025
and lots of different
friends from different unis

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:23.318
kind of all got together.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:25.362
I was with a long-term
girlfriend and she said,

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:27.447
"Do you want to come on holiday
with a bunch of people?"

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:29.366
And Vashti was one of them.

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:34.537
And then, four years
later, I was walking down

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:39.250
an alleyway in East London
and this girl walks by

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:40.835
<i>and she shouted my name.</i>

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.213
[Vashti] <i>I couldn't </i>
<i>quite remember his name,</i>

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:44.923
and I went, "Um, Andy?"

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.300
And he looked around
and I went, "Vashti."

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.552
And we both were marveled
at the difference

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:50.470
in the way we looked.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.555
He was this
really handsome man.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:59.104
<i>He was fairly humble </i>
<i>and very gentle,</i>

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:00.855
<i>which is some of the things</i>

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:02.982
<i>I loved about him </i>
<i>on first meeting him.</i>

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:07.278
[Andy] <i>My first impression</i>
<i>of Vashti was powerful.</i>

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.407
<i>She was just this fearless,</i>
<i>atomic bomb.</i>

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.161
<i>And I guess </i>
<i>I was the other side.</i>

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:19.374
<i>I was quite, quite</i>
<i>quiet person growing up.</i>

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:23.044
<i>I was born in the '70s.</i>

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:25.463
<i>In the North of England.</i>

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:28.049
<i>It wasn't a world of</i>
<i>possibility and excess.</i>

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.969
<i>They'd had a grim old time.</i>

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:34.139
<i>And I just grew up on our</i>
<i>nation's values like that.</i>

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:37.684
<i>Life is tough and you can't</i>
<i>have your cake and eat it.</i>

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:42.897
[Vashti] <i>What stood</i>
<i>out is, you know, I'd see</i>

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.024
<i>these pictures of a</i>
<i>really happy little boy</i>

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.403
<i>and they was clearly quite</i>
<i>a close little family.</i>

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:55.869
<i>It just looks completely</i>
<i>different</i>

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.496
<i>to my upbringing </i>
<i>with hippy parents.</i>

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.793
<i>I was also born </i>
<i>in Wales also,</i>
<i>coincidentally.</i>

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.380
<i>But they decided </i>
<i>that they would drive</i>

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:11.092
<i>across land from England to</i>
<i>India with my sister and I.</i>

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:13.386
<i>So we traveled around</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:15.597
<i>We were in Afghanistan, </i>
<i>Iran, Pakistan</i>

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.475
<i>for quite a few years </i>
<i>of our junior lives.</i>

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.770
<i>So there's a fierce</i>
<i>independence that I was given</i>

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.856
<i>by their lust for adventure.</i>

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:35.158
<i>When I met Andy, I'd met</i>
<i>someone to walk beside</i>

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:36.993
<i>and that feeling</i>
<i>was overwhelming.</i>

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:44.417
<i>His humbleness and my kind</i>
<i>of "rah" brought a balance</i>

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:47.420
<i>to two people that benefited</i>
<i>from something else.</i>

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:53.927
And I think as we've
grown, there's been times

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.637
where we were reversed,
where I've been the one

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.183
that's been charging
hard and she's been able

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:04.646
to sort of sit still and find
new parts of herself in that.

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:10.985
[Vashti] <i>Andy taught me</i>
<i>to not have to be strong,</i>

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:16.074
<i>and I've become this softer,</i>
<i>more vulnerable person.</i>

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:23.831
<i>And so together, kind of like</i>
<i>a lioness and a butterfly,</i>

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:25.667
<i>teaching one to be strong </i>

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:29.087
<i>and one to be soft, </i>
<i>became this love affair.</i>

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:57.991
To the right.

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.370
And in.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:05.415
And forward.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.876
And folding forward.

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:15.258
Rolling on up
and through the center.

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:19.304
Through the nose, Ujjayi.

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:31.107
Let's do something else, Andy.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:51.627
[kids chattering]

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:01.929
Hi.

01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:05.308
What are you doing?

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:06.600
[Vashti] Oh, sorry.

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:09.687
[Andy] I think I heard
some Whitfield children.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:10.604
Daddy.

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:12.482
Daddy's under a pink blanket.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.734
What is that on your eyes?

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:16.319
[Vashti] Just give him five
minutes

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.529
and let daddy just come to.

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.782
What are you doing, daddy?

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:23.618
I'm doing a really
relaxing thing.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.580
Can I have a kiss?

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:49.435
I'm up on my own
in the middle of
the night in discomfort

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:53.981
and there's been a lot of this.

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:57.527
Um...

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:02.615
Kind of reminds me of
before I got diagnosed

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:06.703
lat year and just the constant

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.330
sleepless nights. And the pain.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.959
<i>This aching pain that just</i>
<i>won't go away</i>

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:16.504
<i>adds to the usual </i>
<i>pre-scan anxiety.</i>

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:37.775
What did you have to
catch up on?

01:10:37.859 --> 01:10:41.362
I had to catch up on the...
my homework.

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:43.448
You know the first page
I didn't do?

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:44.365
Yeah.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:50.663
[Vashti] <i>This is such </i>
<i>a roller coaster</i>
<i>of a week.</i>

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.373
What do you mean?
Oh, you got one?

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.542
Great, actually got it.

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:57.545
That one was Anakin in it.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.714
[Vashti] <i>And all we</i>
<i>can do is go with it.</i>

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:01.340
And Obi Wan Kenobi.

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:03.593
It's brand new.

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:06.220
[Vashti] <i>And I'm constantly </i>
<i>fighting to not</i>

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:08.890
<i>get caught </i>
<i>in the terror of it all.</i>

01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:12.310
<i>But I haven't got any answers</i>

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.103
<i>and I really haven't got any</i>
<i>space to process them.</i>

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:16.856
<i>Because I'm trying to process</i>
<i>what's coming next with Andy.</i>

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:25.323
-Babe?
-[Andy] <i>Terrible.</i>

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:27.575
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.787
<i>I feel so much pain.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:32.663
But, I've got Jesse.

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:33.956
Are you okay with Jesse?

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.833
[Andy] <i>I just want to go home.</i>

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.878
Alright, I'll be very quick.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:55.394
<i>Andy was really sleep</i>
<i>deprived and exhausted</i>

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:59.398
<i>and our oncologist basically</i>
<i>just stormed in there</i>

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:00.775
<i>like a bull in a China shop</i>
<i>with a bunch</i>

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:02.693
<i>of other registrars around him</i>

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:05.404
<i>and read Andy the Riot Act </i>
<i>on his chances</i>

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:07.365
<i>being slim and it could be</i>
<i>a choice</i>

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:09.492
<i>if he wanted to </i>
<i>just not go ahead.</i>

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:12.245
[Andy] <i>I said, "What's our</i>
<i>alternative?"</i>

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.372
<i>He says, "Well, you'll die</i>
<i>of lymphoma."</i>

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:17.834
<i>And I'm like, "What?</i>

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:19.418
<i>Then we'll keep going."</i>

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:27.134
I will support
whatever you choose.

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:29.512
If you choose that chemo
is the way.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.765
Well, you know, I've had
11 rounds of chemo, you know.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.934
I've had 11 rounds
of fucking chemo

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:38.604
over the last year.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:41.524
And perhaps that's too much?

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:48.072
And deja vu, here we are,

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.908
waiting for the phone to ring
to see what my fate...

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:55.997
is according to, you know,
my oncologist.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.918
<i>So it's kind of </i>
<i>make or break today.</i>

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.344
[phone ringing]

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:13.639
Here we go.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:14.557
John.

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:17.810
-[John] <i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, we're here.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:19.604
Sorry, I'm just putting
you on loud speaker.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:20.980
[John] <i>Okay.</i>

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:26.068
<i>Alright, um, nothing good, </i>
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:27.403
Okay.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.867
[John] <i>The PET scan</i>
<i>compared to the previous scan</i>

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:35.995
<i>showed that the mass </i>
<i>in the abdomen</i>

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:39.749
<i>was larger and more active.</i>

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.087
<i>This is clearly not the result</i>
<i>that any of us wanted.</i>

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:49.300
<i>This represents the</i>
<i>nasty aggressive nature</i>

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:50.843
<i>of your recurrent lymphoma</i>

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:55.640
<i>that is resistant to all of</i>
<i>the standard lymphoma drugs.</i>

01:13:56.265 --> 01:14:00.102
<i>And so maybe it's worthwhile</i>
<i>considering radiotherapy.</i>

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:03.064
Okay.

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:05.858
[sighs] Wow.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.906
[John] <i>We're really</i>
<i>in a very tight corner</i>

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:13.824
<i>with not too many other, um...</i>

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.536
<i>options...</i>

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:22.583
<i>Okay?</i>

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.168
-Okay.
-[Vashti] Thank you.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.171
So how do you feel, hon?

01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:29.799
You know, the good thing is
it's totally

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:31.634
unrelated to chemotherapy, so,

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:35.846
it's not like
if chemotherapy works,

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.556
radiation doesn't work,
you know?

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:40.351
Well, you know.
There's a couple of tracks.

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:42.144
You can go to a second opinion.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.522
You can go and find another
oncologist

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:46.857
who might want to try
a different mix.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.069
There's got to be other
alternative ways

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.238
of reducing your lymphoma.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:54.156
Sure, let's find out.

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:57.994
I love you.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:00.746
I love you, too,
and you look calm.

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:04.458
Yeah.
I guess for the last few days,

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:09.130
I've been facing
my own mortality.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:13.175
For the first time,
I've actually,

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:15.261
gone, "You know what?

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:18.305
I wonder what it'd be like
just to go, 'I might die?'"

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.434
Whereas before, it's
been like, "I don't care.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.894
Whatever you say,
I'm gonna make it."

01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:26.772
And it's been really liberating

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:29.692
to sort of sit,
actually sit in it and go,

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:32.069
"You know what?

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:33.237
I might only have
three months left.

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.032
I might, that might be my
journey."

01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:41.370
And I'm not actually
afraid of that.

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:43.831
And I guess that's why
I mentioned before

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.499
about there's a sort of,

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.918
it feels almost selfish
to think like that

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:52.173
because there are other
people at stake, you know?

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.050
There's my children
who need a father.

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:57.219
And my wife
who needs a husband,

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:01.766
although I don't do that much
right now.

01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:05.644
You do a good job.

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:08.689
And, I just don't know.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:11.150
I just think I've kind of
made some peace

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.735
over the last few days
with that,

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.573
which is sort of weird because

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:20.326
I don't know if that's a
good thing or a bad thing,

01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:21.911
but I certainly feel--

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:23.370
But don't you think you
should think about it?

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:24.455
I think
you should just feel it.

01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:26.624
I want you to do
what's in your heart

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:29.001
and not what your head tells
you to do.

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:31.837
Because I think
you're really clear on that

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:33.589
and perhaps you've
not listened to that

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:37.009
because you've been
so frightened and sick.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:43.182
And I just know
that whatever happens [weakly]

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.643
because I don't see you not
being there.

01:16:45.976 --> 01:16:49.021
The kids will honor
and respect the choices
you made

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:54.193
to be here and to
take them on that journey.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.324
I guess...

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:06.705
you'd do anything to be there
for your kids, you know?

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:07.957
And that's what
I still want to do.

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.807
Right now I just feel
overwhelmed.

01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:33.858
And I'm not sure
how it's all gonna work.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:34.900
I know it will.

01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:38.863
But I just feel ripped off
again, today.

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:43.951
I can't believe it.

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:44.952
I just don't get why...

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.081
why it isn't working.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.045
[exhales]

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:55.963
Holy shit.

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:58.841
This is huge.

01:18:00.968 --> 01:18:02.052
This is huge.

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.057
And terrifying.

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:13.397
I've gotta go.

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:28.871
How are you?

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:30.331
Good, how are you feeling?

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:35.502
I feel a bit wiped out
the last two or three days,

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:39.632
really lethargic and then...

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:43.677
I don't have my usual

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:48.432
self-motivating "oomph".

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:56.148
<i>Here I am, nine months later.</i>

01:18:56.774 --> 01:18:58.525
<i>Pretty fucked, pretty depleted.</i>

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.071
<i>I'm now in the minority group</i>

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:04.073
<i>where I'm not responding </i>
<i>to chemo.</i>

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.659
<i>And it's truly frightening.</i>

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:13.791
<i>I'm just trying to find some</i>
<i>serenity, and some calm in it.</i>

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:20.381
I know that, you know,
with fear and anger,

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:23.133
which is probably the same
thing, really,

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:25.886
they're all outward.

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:27.680
It's all depleting, you know.

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:31.433
When you invest in it, it's
all, it's kind of not helpful.

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.103
<i>And the opposite of that is</i>

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:38.274
<i>love, compassion, </i>
<i>and forgiveness.</i>

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:44.029
And if you can convert
into that,

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:46.198
that's an inward thing.

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.243
That's a...
that's a healing thing.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:53.831
And I guess it's part of my
evolution to get through this.

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:57.918
[Acupuncturist] Feel
some warmth there, Andy?

01:19:58.002 --> 01:19:59.169
Yeah, it feels great.

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:02.589
[Andy] <i>Because I think that</i>
<i>brings together the whole</i>

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:06.844
<i>psychological, emotional,</i>
<i>spiritual side of a person.</i>

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:12.057
<i>You know you shouldn't wait</i>
<i>to get cancer</i>

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:14.601
<i>before you start </i>
<i>to think that way.</i>

01:20:24.903 --> 01:20:26.071
Hi, how are you?

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:29.366
Professor Gibson spoke
to me on Tuesday afternoon.

01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:30.284
Yeah.

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:32.578
He talked to me about your
scan result

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:35.497
and asked me to see you think
about some radiotherapy.

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.541
-Have you seen
the scan results?
-Yeah.

01:20:37.624 --> 01:20:41.295
So this is your head,
your arm, and your spine.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:42.921
-This is your bladder.
-[Andy] Yeah.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:44.256
[Vashti] So that's not
the lymphoma?

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:46.550
No, the black part is uptick.

01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:51.013
So it's normal for your brain,
bladder.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:52.473
So this is the lumbar lymphoma.

01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:53.474
[Andy] Right.

01:20:54.141 --> 01:20:55.517
[Vashti] Right, so
the smaller black mass

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:56.769
in the middle is the lymphoma.

01:20:57.102 --> 01:20:58.312
-[Andy] Yeah.
-[Vashti] Yeah.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:01.315
How are you feeling in general?

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:06.737
I'm feeling a little better
from not doing chemotherapy.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:11.116
But there's pain, almost like
sciatica, but not shooting.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.951
And your legs
are feeling strong?

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:14.036
You don't feel weak?

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:17.748
When I walk, when I walk
for a while,

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.833
I get the sensation
that I need to

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:21.710
just stop walking
and crouch down.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:23.003
[Angela] Because of?

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:27.591
Because I feel a slight,
a building tension in there.

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:30.386
-In your back?
-Mmm.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:33.305
So giving you
radiotherapy alone

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.474
for lumbar lymphoma
that hasn't

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:39.061
responded to chemotherapy
is not enough.

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.021
It won't be for long time cure.

01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:43.857
They will assist you
with another pet scan...

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:51.573
[somber music]

01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:53.242
[sighs]

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:56.578
[Andy] <i>The pain is just</i>
<i>getting worse and worse.</i>

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.466
[Vashti] <i>We just have to battle</i>
<i>through this.</i>

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:12.052
<i>Zap the fuck out of it.</i>

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:15.264
<i>Get his pain under control</i>
<i>and we go somewhere</i>

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.015
<i>and start treatment </i>
<i>somewhere else.</i>

01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:22.479
And I don't believe
it's in Andy's

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:27.276
or my destiny for him
to leave this life

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.612
this early through lymphoma.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.489
I don't believe that, at all.

01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:35.159
It doesn't feel in my
gut but that's how it is.

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:44.168
Just think of Jesse and Indi.

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:45.377
You've got to get through this.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:46.462
You can do it.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:48.255
Five minutes.

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:52.176
Count it down, yeah.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:00.934
Try and breathe all the way
down to your little shaky toes.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:05.647
[Andy yelps]

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.274
You can do this, Andy.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:15.782
[Andy yelps]

01:23:16.283 --> 01:23:18.243
Breathe into your tummy,
sweetheart.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:21.413
[indistinct chattering]

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:26.001
You're doing a great job,
nearly there.

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:31.215
Think about little Jesse Red
in your head, see his face.

01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:35.302
You can move now, gorgeous.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:38.680
[woman] Alright,
excellent job.

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:42.768
Who was that?

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.102
That was Kelly.

01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:46.104
She snuck a kiss in.

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:47.523
[laughs] Couldn't help myself.

01:23:57.908 --> 01:24:00.327
[slow music]

01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:14.466
[Andy] <i>I've been doing</i>
<i>the radiation therapy</i>

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.677
<i>for about a week and a half.</i>

01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:20.389
Do you see me smiling?

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:24.226
<i>But, something's working</i>
<i>because...</i>

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:29.523
I've had remarkable,
remarkable pain relief.

01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:32.067
<i>You know, I'm looking more</i>
<i>normal now</i>

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:35.195
<i>and feeling better everyday</i>
<i>and my energy's coming back.</i>

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:44.871
I'm back in the normal grind
of life, which is nice.

01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:47.958
You know, I'm ready for work
and I've been wondering

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:49.418
when I can get back
to it.

01:24:51.712 --> 01:24:53.130
We're at Fox Studios.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:57.092
We both have an audition,
my friend Jai here,

01:24:58.594 --> 01:25:01.054
for the same movie,
for different characters.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:03.515
Did I have to learn? I was
supposed to learn the line,
wasn't it?

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:04.891
You were supposed
to learn the lines.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:06.852
-I think I've got those.
-You haven't.

01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:08.937
I'll be alright.
I'll get through it.

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:10.230
It's alright.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:12.065
[man] Rolling.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:17.279
But we all, all must
hold fast in our belief

01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:19.323
that the Lord's light
will burn eternal.

01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:26.955
<i>For the first time in a while,</i>
<i>I'm not putting everything</i>
<i>on hold</i>

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:28.832
<i>and going,</i>
<i>"Well, we can't be happy </i>

01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:31.168
<i>and we can't do stuff </i>
<i>until this is over."</i>

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.546
<i>Because, really, </i>
<i>the good stuff is</i>

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.632
<i>what's going on right now.</i>

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:40.886
Now we need daddy to eat
lots while he's hungry.

01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:46.016
Our highlight has been
how much time

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:48.810
my children got to spend
with their grandparents

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:50.646
and, you know, and
how close they are.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.773
[Rob] You shouldn't
be wasting the water.

01:25:54.524 --> 01:25:57.736
[Andy] <i>So, amazing, amazing,</i>
<i>they had that time together.</i>

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:02.074
<i>My mum was coming initially </i>

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.159
<i>because I was getting </i>
<i>a stem cell transplant</i>

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:06.745
and that's not
going to happen now.

01:26:07.621 --> 01:26:11.708
So, we were like, "Go home,
get grounded.

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:14.002
This thing is going to
go on for a little while.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:16.088
So you know,
let's all have a break."

01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:17.798
I'm going to miss you.

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:18.715
Oh, Mum.

01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:20.258
[crying]

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:21.843
Take care.

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:24.930
-You know where I am.
-I know.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:25.847
It's hard.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:27.557
We'll just carry on, you know?

01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:28.517
[Pat] Of course.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.434
Nothing's changed.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:30.644
[Pat] No, no it hasn't.

01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:31.978
It's just time for you
to have a break.

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:34.356
-Bye, gorgeous.
-Thanks, Dad.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:36.692
[Vashti] Thanks for
everything.

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:39.528
You've made this journey so
much easier. I mean it.

01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:41.905
Bye, Mum.
I love you.

01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:43.240
[Pat] I love you, too.

01:26:43.323 --> 01:26:44.866
Thanks for everything.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:45.867
[Pat] I haven't done anything.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.411
No, you have, Mum.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:50.414
I think, for them, it's
very difficult to go

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:54.126
because, you know,
it's not over.

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:55.669
It's not resolved.

01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:57.629
[Vashti] Say goodbye.

01:26:57.963 --> 01:27:00.799
<i>But as a family, we're much</i>
<i>clearer now</i>

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:04.428
<i>that we're going to have to</i>
<i>try to live with lymphoma.</i>

01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:12.269
[soothing guitar music]

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:26.408
Fuck, it's another
beautiful day.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.996
I didn't leave the house
for four days.

01:27:31.788 --> 01:27:33.123
It was just too hard.

01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:41.339
<i>Radiation treatment finished</i>
<i>about four weeks ago,</i>

01:27:42.132 --> 01:27:43.800
<i>and I was feeling amazing.</i>

01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:47.137
<i>And then I had pain for, </i>
<i>like, ten days.</i>

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:55.020
<i>I had a scan yesterday</i>
<i>and so we should find out</i>

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:58.106
<i>in the next hour how effective</i>
<i>the radiation treatment was.</i>

01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:08.867
So I've lost a few kilos.

01:28:11.328 --> 01:28:12.746
I'm 77 kilos now.

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:16.333
I got weighed yesterday
for my scan.

01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:20.962
What do you think she's
going to say, Vashti?

01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:22.923
The information is irrelevant.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.966
What you have to do,
whether it's in remission

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:27.427
or not in remission
is exactly the same.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:31.223
You have to go on
to heal and recover.

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:34.142
Come on, call.

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:41.525
[phone ringing]

01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:44.945
Hi, Angela, can you hear me?

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:47.155
[Angela] <i>Yes, </i>
<i>it's dropping off a bit.</i>

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:48.073
Okay.

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:49.115
[Angela] <i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:50.033
-Yes.
-We can hear you.

01:28:50.116 --> 01:28:51.117
[Angela] <i>How are you, Andy?</i>

01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:52.285
I'm good.

01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:54.830
My pain's much better today,
actually.

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:56.915
[Angela] <i> Right, I heard you</i>
<i>were in a bit of pain</i>

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:58.041
<i>when you came in.</i>

01:28:58.124 --> 01:29:03.880
Yeah, just that lying
flat, I can't really do.

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:06.883
[Angela] <i>Yes, I've got</i>
<i>your scan results here.</i>

01:29:06.967 --> 01:29:09.010
<i>Do you want me to go</i>
<i>through them with you?</i>

01:29:09.469 --> 01:29:10.929
-Yeah, yeah, do.
-Yeah.

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.347
Our intention, today, Angela,

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:15.433
is to get clearer,
get a snapshot

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:18.144
of where you guys
think we're at

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:22.399
and either draw a line
in the sand there

01:29:22.482 --> 01:29:25.151
and kind of go off and
deal with it ourselves

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:29.322
-and to hear what your
thoughts are on, you know...
-<i>Sure.</i>

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:32.534
...if there is any moving
forward with you guys.

01:29:33.577 --> 01:29:36.872
[Angela] <i>Well, the PET scan </i>
<i>is not good news at all.</i>

01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:43.253
<i>The big lump inside his</i>
<i>abdomen is still there</i>

01:29:44.004 --> 01:29:46.172
<i>where he had radiotherapy.</i>

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:47.632
<i>And, also, </i>
<i>it looks like there's</i>

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:49.801
<i>two new areas in the chest.</i>

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:53.555
Okay.

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:56.349
<i>So it's not good news.</i>

01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:58.435
<i>It's not a good picture at all.</i>

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:00.645
So what does that mean?

01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:01.813
Is that lymphoma?

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:03.023
<i>That's lymphoma.</i>

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:07.152
So...

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:10.238
<i>We are dealing with</i>
<i>a very difficult lymphoma.</i>

01:30:11.781 --> 01:30:15.952
<i>I think more radiotherapy is</i>
<i>unlikely to change the picture.</i>

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:25.962
[Vashti] Okay, Angela,
thank you.

01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:26.963
<i>Okay, alright.</i>

01:30:27.047 --> 01:30:28.340
[Vashti] Okay,
have a good day.

01:30:28.423 --> 01:30:29.257
<i>Bye.</i>

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.350
So how do you feel, honeybun?

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:41.645
Well...

01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:45.732
How do I feel?

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:48.568
Now my cancer has spread?

01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:58.119
I don't know.

01:31:00.747 --> 01:31:03.208
I mean, that was the
one thing I didn't want.

01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:08.046
I thought, "If it's the
same, then it's the same.

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.964
Nothing's got worse...

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:14.886
I'm in the same position.

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:17.055
I'll just go from here."

01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:20.934
But, for it to have spread
is really...

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.105
frightening.

01:31:27.691 --> 01:31:29.901
And they're saying I've got
three to six months to live.

01:31:31.778 --> 01:31:32.737
Three to six months.

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:34.364
[Vashti] But you know,
you had that six months ago

01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:35.532
and you're still here.

01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:38.493
I know, but at the time,
I was having chemo and radio

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:41.162
and stuff that was buying time.

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:43.039
But they're only words, honey.

01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:46.543
You know, before when
you were doing the show,

01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:48.878
when you were doing the
<i>Spartacus</i> show,

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:50.922
before the camera used to roll,

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:54.384
you used to do this thing
where, like,

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:58.471
you know you'd be getting
psyched up and you'd go
[grunts].

01:31:58.555 --> 01:32:01.015
Like I can't remember, you'd
always do the same thing

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:03.351
every time, like bit like
a tennis player

01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:05.061
or whatever
would do their thing.

01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:06.396
Like you'd always do it.

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:09.858
And it's time to do that
for this.

01:32:13.445 --> 01:32:14.654
Whatever the... you're right.

01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:16.948
I mean, it's hardly any
different from yesterday,
is it?

01:32:17.157 --> 01:32:18.158
[Vashti] Well, it's no
different.

01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:21.161
In fact, it's not as bad as
the day I was first diagnosed

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:24.831
a year and a half ago,
where I had stage four.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:28.293
Everywhere.

01:32:31.337 --> 01:32:33.047
You've got to get through it.

01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:34.257
You will get through it.

01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:37.135
But you have got to roll your
sleeves up.

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.638
They are a bunch of words.

01:32:41.097 --> 01:32:43.183
If you believe them
and put weight in them,

01:32:43.266 --> 01:32:44.684
they will become our reality.

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:46.269
Full stop.

01:32:50.023 --> 01:32:50.982
Wow.

01:32:51.858 --> 01:32:52.942
It's never dull.

01:32:56.988 --> 01:32:57.822
Wow.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.379
<i>From my oncologist's </i>
<i>point of view,</i>

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:14.756
<i>there's no treatment for me.</i>

01:33:15.757 --> 01:33:18.176
And in that has come
a sort of sense of...

01:33:23.973 --> 01:33:25.475
I guess, liberation.

01:33:25.558 --> 01:33:30.480
I feel like I'm excited
to be in control of it

01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:33.525
and I think that's the main
thing is control of it.

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:34.901
It's the thing I haven't had.

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:36.986
I felt powerless.

01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:40.156
I felt in a system that...

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:43.284
just grouped me
with other people

01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:44.828
and gave me the same cocktail

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:49.290
and hoped it would work
and I feel it's got to be

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:51.292
much more fine-tuned than that.

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:07.642
<i>The main thing </i>
<i>I'm looking for</i>

01:34:07.725 --> 01:34:12.188
<i>is inspiration and to be</i>
<i>with like-minded people</i>

01:34:12.272 --> 01:34:17.318
who have survived 10, 20, 30
40 years against the odds.

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:21.990
<i>So, it's about being </i>
<i>in this group</i>

01:34:22.073 --> 01:34:24.909
<i>over here where </i>
<i>everything's possible.</i>

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:30.373
<i>I have to find another way </i>
<i>to keep this lymphoma at bay </i>

01:34:30.456 --> 01:34:32.458
<i>or make it </i>
<i>so it doesn't affect me.</i>

01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:36.462
<i>It's up to me now.</i>

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.948
I'm packing up the apartment

01:35:04.032 --> 01:35:06.284
because we're moving house
on Friday.

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:12.665
What sparked that was that Andy
can no longer do the stairs.

01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:22.050
<i>And we have Andy's mum here</i>
<i>who arrived last Wednesday</i>

01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:27.555
to see us, stay with us,
see Andy, just be around.

01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:30.934
<i>And she's been amazing.</i>

01:35:31.017 --> 01:35:33.061
<i>There's no smiling through it</i>
<i>saying, "Everything's fine."</i>

01:35:33.144 --> 01:35:34.854
<i>You know, she's really present.</i>

01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:37.190
<i>And she gets </i>
<i>where the situation is at.</i>

01:35:38.441 --> 01:35:39.275
It's massive.

01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:41.027
That sofa could go in there.

01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:45.114
Anyway, we'll work
all that out later.

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:49.535
[Andy]
<i>I'm sort of juggling pain</i>
<i>and insanity at the moment,</i>

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:56.250
<i>and on top of that, my left</i>
<i>leg started to get numb.</i>

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:58.836
[Vashti] Are you going to
be okay getting down, honey?

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.380
Yeah, I'm just trying to
remember what

01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:04.425
they taught me so I don't
fall down the stairs.

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:05.885
[Vashti] <i>It's going to be </i>
<i>a real adjustment.</i>

01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:07.178
<i>And that's hard.</i>

01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:09.222
<i>It's really hard.</i>

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:15.186
You just go, "Will I ever get,
you know,

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:17.021
when will I get
my husband back?"

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.232
[weakly]
I don't know about that.

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:23.236
So, it's just adjusting to that

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:26.364
and holding a space
for that being possible

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:29.075
and then seeing the
breakdown, you know,

01:36:29.951 --> 01:36:33.371
quicken and accelerate
and just going,

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:35.081
"okay how do we stop
that acceleration?"

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:37.667
<i>So, I need to support him </i>

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:40.878
<i>to do something</i>
<i>to stop that acceleration.</i>

01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:43.381
But, I actually thought
it's a really nice space

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:46.009
to have kids playing around,
and you know.

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:50.138
I just get a sense that
something like cancer

01:36:50.221 --> 01:36:53.307
has a switch and...

01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:55.435
you can...

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:59.522
reverse it if you find
out where that switch is.

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:05.778
And I guess I'm in that
stage of exploration

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:08.656
of what or where
that switch is.

01:37:10.199 --> 01:37:13.453
But, damn, it would be
good to go to New Zealand

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.583
and have some acupuncture
and get some tangible,

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.919
you know, changes in my body.

01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:24.797
<i>So that's the plan.</i>

01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:36.517
The speed at which things
are moving or have changed.

01:37:39.812 --> 01:37:43.149
I guess it's brought
another level of...

01:37:45.443 --> 01:37:47.904
anxiety and I'm not
really sure where Vashti is

01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:51.157
with this because she's
doing an incredible job

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.658
of just getting on
with everything.

01:37:53.284 --> 01:37:55.161
[Jesse] <i> </i> I'm really
proud of you, daddy.

01:37:55.328 --> 01:37:56.496
Oh, my darling.

01:37:56.996 --> 01:37:58.081
I love you.

01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:00.166
[Vashti] Big give cuddles
to daddy bear.

01:38:00.249 --> 01:38:01.501
[Jesse] I wish
I could come with.

01:38:01.584 --> 01:38:02.668
[Vashti] Well, you know what?

01:38:02.752 --> 01:38:03.878
Another time.

01:38:04.962 --> 01:38:07.548
We've got to look after
the house, okay?

01:38:07.673 --> 01:38:09.801
[Andy] <i>I want to continue</i>
<i>this life</i>

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:11.969
<i>with seeing my children</i>
<i>grow up.</i>

01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:14.263
<i>But let's say I didn't make it.</i>

01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:17.225
<i>I know Vashti would</i>
<i>get through.</i>

01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:19.602
<i>You know, </i>
<i>she's bring up our kids</i>

01:38:19.769 --> 01:38:22.438
<i>and my kids would have</i>
<i>an extraordinary life.</i>

01:38:22.647 --> 01:38:24.607
I'll be at the end
of the phone, okay?

01:38:25.817 --> 01:38:26.818
I love you.

01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:28.194
[Andy] I love you too.

01:38:28.694 --> 01:38:30.571
[Vashti] Bye, bye.

01:38:31.781 --> 01:38:35.409
I don't regret, you know,
the way I've approached it.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.499
<i>You know at the end of</i>
<i>the day, life happens.</i>

01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:44.627
<i>Don't try to deny </i>
<i>that it's there.</i>

01:38:45.128 --> 01:38:46.295
<i>Experience it.</i>

01:38:47.964 --> 01:38:49.340
Brave daddy bear.

01:38:49.841 --> 01:38:51.843
Okay, let's get and get warm.

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:55.513
[Andy] <i> I just think </i>
<i>it's all a part </i>

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.765
<i>of some amazing journey, </i>
<i>you know?</i>

01:39:00.643 --> 01:39:02.145
<i>I don't know if I would</i>
<i>have ever looked at it</i>

01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:05.982
<i>that way had I not spent the</i>
<i>last 12 years with Vashti.</i>

01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:31.424
<i>When I said goodbye </i>
<i>to Andy in the cab,</i>

01:39:31.507 --> 01:39:34.260
I didn't think in less
than a week,

01:39:34.343 --> 01:39:36.095
I was going to be going up
to collect my husband

01:39:36.179 --> 01:39:39.849
who I felt had very,
very short time left.

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:43.269
[woman over PA] <i>Ladies and</i>
<i>gentlemen, we're about to land.</i>

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:44.854
<i>Please fasten your seat belts.</i>

01:39:46.564 --> 01:39:49.775
<i>When I got to New Zealand,</i>
<i>it was quite shocking.</i>

01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:53.613
He was so in and out of...

01:39:56.324 --> 01:39:57.158
lucidity.

01:39:59.202 --> 01:40:01.621
<i>And suddenly, </i>
<i>he did this snap</i>
<i>into focus,</i>

01:40:02.163 --> 01:40:03.539
<i>and he said, "I wanna go home."</i>

01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:08.127
Because somewhere in him,
he knew it was time to go,

01:40:08.336 --> 01:40:09.545
and he wanted to go home.

01:40:14.759 --> 01:40:16.552
<i>But the whole journey </i>
<i>I watched Andy</i>

01:40:16.636 --> 01:40:18.930
<i>because I wasn't sure</i>
<i>he was gonna make it.</i>

01:40:23.809 --> 01:40:26.729
<i>And in the morning, we</i>
<i>took him to the hospice.</i>

01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:31.901
<i>And when I started </i>
<i>to see Andy fading,</i>

01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:36.197
<i>I brought the kids in</i>
<i>and I said,</i>

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.116
<i>"The kids have come to</i>
<i>say goodbye now, darling."</i>

01:40:40.284 --> 01:40:41.911
And he said,
"I'm going to go soon

01:40:41.994 --> 01:40:43.329
and I have to go up to heaven

01:40:43.412 --> 01:40:46.123
because my body's
really broken."

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:47.792
And Indi went, "Why, daddy?"

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:50.544
And he said, "Because my body
is broken like a butterfly.

01:40:50.628 --> 01:40:54.298
When its wing is broken,
it really can't fly anymore.

01:40:54.382 --> 01:40:55.591
It has to go."

01:40:56.008 --> 01:40:57.260
And he said, "But don't worry
because

01:40:57.343 --> 01:40:59.595
I'm going to go up into
the sky and every time

01:40:59.679 --> 01:41:01.180
you need to see me,
I will be there.

01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:02.640
<i>Just look for me."</i>

01:41:04.767 --> 01:41:07.645
<i>And that was how he said</i>
<i>goodbye to the kids.</i> [crying]

01:41:13.693 --> 01:41:17.238
<i>And I laid down next to</i>
<i>him, and we just laid still</i>

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:20.283
and there was this moment
where I said to him,

01:41:21.659 --> 01:41:24.328
"I need you to know
how much I love you."

01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:28.457
And he kind of just sounded,
he made this funny noise.

01:41:28.541 --> 01:41:30.835
He just made this, like,
"I love you."

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:36.340
He sounded like Rocky after
just winning his fight.

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:38.009
But, I, you know, I got it.

01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:41.929
And it was amazing that
he, out of nowhere,

01:41:42.013 --> 01:41:44.432
was able to do that,
you know, just to honor.

01:41:45.224 --> 01:41:47.560
I didn't need to hear it,
I know it. I knew it.

01:41:51.314 --> 01:41:54.108
<i>He just took these </i>
<i>big deep breaths</i>

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:56.402
<i>and then he just died.</i>

01:42:03.868 --> 01:42:06.245
<i>It was a very beautiful,</i>
<i>peaceful moment.</i>

01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:11.542
<i>And I felt like he went to</i>

01:42:11.625 --> 01:42:13.753
<i>suddenly being really strong</i>
<i>again.</i>

01:42:19.008 --> 01:42:22.011
[soft violin music]

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.833
We opened our front door
in Sydney and...

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.293
it's got big
black and white tiles,

01:42:54.377 --> 01:42:58.881
and literally, laid out
perfectly in the center

01:42:59.215 --> 01:43:01.425
of the front door step
is this exquisite

01:43:01.509 --> 01:43:04.929
big black and white butterfly
and the kids are like,

01:43:05.054 --> 01:43:07.348
"Oh, my god,
there's a butterfly.

01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:09.100
Dad has come to visit us.

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:11.936
Look, it's just like dad,
it's got a broken wing."

01:43:13.813 --> 01:43:16.982
<i>It was a really extraordinary</i>
<i>experience just seeing</i>

01:43:17.066 --> 01:43:20.653
how my children had created
this really wonderful

01:43:20.736 --> 01:43:22.530
kind of symbol of their dad.

01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:27.952
<i>And so I see this little</i>
<i>man have this happen to him,</i>

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:31.247
<i>and this little girl</i>
<i>and I know that it can</i>

01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:35.668
only have them be more
extraordinary

01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:37.503
and I believe that 100%.

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:42.383
[kids playful]

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.219
How high can they go?

01:43:45.636 --> 01:43:48.973
And for me,
I lost my best friend

01:43:49.723 --> 01:43:55.396
and I lost my husband
of like 10 years,

01:43:55.479 --> 01:43:58.274
and my lover of 13 years,

01:43:59.525 --> 01:44:01.152
and it hurts like a fucker.

01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:04.613
But the reality is
that I got 13 years

01:44:04.697 --> 01:44:06.449
of the most extraordinary
relationship

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:09.243
and lived a crazy life
and beautiful life.

01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:14.665
I don't see how you can't
<i>turn something like this</i>

01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:17.501
<i>into something wonderful.</i>

01:44:19.545 --> 01:44:21.797
<i>Because what else </i>
<i>is there to do?</i>

01:44:26.844 --> 01:44:30.973
And he would be so proud
because it has all been

01:44:31.056 --> 01:44:33.267
initiated by him.

01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:38.981
<i>Andy just came to join us.</i>

01:44:40.566 --> 01:44:43.736
<i>The way that he chose </i>
<i>to live and...</i>

01:44:43.819 --> 01:44:47.323
<i>his quiet ambition for making</i>
<i>things happen in his life.</i>

01:44:48.824 --> 01:44:51.869
<i>It's really inspired me </i>
<i>to just be empowered </i>

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:54.330
<i>and try things</i>
<i>myself for the first time.</i>

01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:57.082
<i>And it feels kind of exciting.</i>

01:44:57.249 --> 01:44:58.250
Hoo! Hoo!

01:44:59.668 --> 01:45:01.337
Hello, little elves.

01:45:02.379 --> 01:45:06.091
<i>And, by the way, that's</i>
<i>how he ran his life.</i>

01:45:06.258 --> 01:45:07.468
<i>And he still died.</i>

01:45:08.052 --> 01:45:10.054
So, all this stuff
about being powerful

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:12.723
at manifestation and
making the most of life

01:45:12.806 --> 01:45:14.600
doesn't mean you're going
to get happily ever after.

01:45:14.683 --> 01:45:16.185
But, that's the whole point.

01:45:16.268 --> 01:45:18.979
It's like, you get
what you get
to make the most of it

01:45:19.188 --> 01:45:21.774
because it can
be something extraordinary.

01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:26.570
Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:30.991
<i>But, for now, we're just going</i>
<i>to focus on being here now,</i>

01:45:31.075 --> 01:45:35.079
<i>as cheesy as that sounds,</i>
<i>and living more fully.</i>

01:45:35.621 --> 01:45:38.165
