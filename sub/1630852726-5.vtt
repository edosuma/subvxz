WEBVTT

00:03.829 --> 00:06.006
How about this Jamaican resort?

00:06.049 --> 00:08.269
We can escape the chilly
Langley winter

00:08.312 --> 00:10.662
at a heavily guarded
manmade beach!

00:10.706 --> 00:11.794
Or we could check out

00:11.837 --> 00:13.056
Willie Nelson's Museum
in Nashville.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.624
Dude loves weed and headbands!

00:15.667 --> 00:18.061
I've heard your input,
and I propose we do...

00:18.105 --> 00:20.716
none of those things!

00:20.759 --> 00:22.761
You could've just
had me move that.

00:22.805 --> 00:26.113
The Smith clan shall vacation
in Rustic Pines!

00:29.116 --> 00:31.292
The quaint ski town?

00:31.335 --> 00:33.511
Where I used to go as a kid?

00:33.555 --> 00:36.166
I know that look on
everyone's face, Mr. S.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.428
They're about to yell,

00:37.472 --> 00:39.300
"Jeff, nobody has
any frickin' idea

00:39.343 --> 00:40.910
what you're talking about!"

00:40.953 --> 00:43.043
Picture it-- we'll wake up
with the sun,

00:43.086 --> 00:46.524
ski through peaceful woods,
a mountain breeze in our hair.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.483
Ahh.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.441
Then, we'll retire
to a tiny log cabin

00:50.485 --> 00:52.356
with no water or electricity

00:52.400 --> 00:54.880
and poop in an outhouse,
like God intended.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.578
Ugh!

00:56.621 --> 00:59.102
Honey, thumbs up
on the fun ski stuff,

00:59.146 --> 01:02.018
but thumbs down on the pooping
like an animal.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.541
How about a nice hotel?

01:03.585 --> 01:05.848
Vacations aren't about
fancy-pants hotels

01:05.891 --> 01:07.415
with robot toilets.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.199
They're about getting away
from it all.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.766
I'll give it a try, Stan.

01:10.809 --> 01:12.985
Go with the flow,
that's what I always say.

01:13.029 --> 01:15.205
I guess, but this
"go" seems like it flows

01:15.249 --> 01:16.554
somewhere shitty.

01:16.598 --> 01:19.731
Your father has a different
idea of "fun"

01:19.775 --> 01:22.082
because his family grew up...

01:22.125 --> 01:24.345
I don't want to say "poor"--

01:24.388 --> 01:27.174
but with less money than
a family needs to not be poor.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.437
Poor?
I don't think so.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.527
In fact, my pops even bought me
a fake ID at age 6

01:32.570 --> 01:34.006
so I could sell my blood.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.139
In conclusion, not poor.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.272
What are you guys up to?
Never mind, don't care.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.665
I'm turning my alcove
into a home office,

01:40.709 --> 01:43.842
and its gonna be siiick!

01:43.886 --> 01:45.192
But, seriously,
what are you guys up to?

01:45.235 --> 01:47.411
Can I do it, too?
Pleeeease?

01:49.805 --> 01:51.459
So, "maybe," then?

02:28.626 --> 02:31.586

02:31.629 --> 02:34.676
The answer is no because we
officially got away from that!

02:36.243 --> 02:38.723
Get a lung full of
this fresh mountain air.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.117
Huh. That actually
is kinda nice.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.423
I don't know.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.860
It all just smells
like squirrel farts to me.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.558
Shh!

02:47.602 --> 02:49.430
And if that's not
enough nature for you,

02:49.473 --> 02:52.041
the forecast calls
for an epic powder dump--

02:52.084 --> 02:53.521
a skier's paradise.

02:56.741 --> 03:00.876
Prepare for total relaxation
in 3, 2--

03:03.574 --> 03:06.534
- That was relaxing.
- I don't get it.

03:06.577 --> 03:07.796
There's never traffic
heading into

03:07.839 --> 03:09.624
this little
nothing of a town.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.669
Someone must've hit a moose
or froze to death

03:11.713 --> 03:13.541
in their car
or something else picturesque.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.459
Welcome to heaven.

03:18.502 --> 03:19.851
When I was a kid, we had a game

03:19.895 --> 03:21.897
to see who could touch
that sign first.

03:21.940 --> 03:22.985
And we're all playing it
right now!

03:23.899 --> 03:25.770
I win! Tee-hee!

03:27.076 --> 03:30.079
Log Cabin Sign Condos?

03:30.122 --> 03:32.690
Awesome!
Bet it has a pool!

03:32.734 --> 03:34.126
Bet it has one of
those little pools

03:34.170 --> 03:35.867
with super hot water!

03:35.911 --> 03:37.956
- You mean a hot tub?
- Maybe.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.871
You know, where you go
like this!

03:41.960 --> 03:44.963
- A soup bowl?
- No, that's hot tub, Mom.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.878
He always ends up
with some kind of GI issue.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.837
This place is terrible now!

03:48.880 --> 03:51.143
Stan, my dude, relax.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.929
You're not poor anymore.
You've earned a trip like this.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.452
We were never poor, you idiot!

03:55.496 --> 03:57.149
Oh, idiot, huh?

03:57.193 --> 03:59.195
Would an idiot-- Aah!

03:59.239 --> 04:01.763
I said, would an idiot--
Aah!

04:01.806 --> 04:04.069
Never mind.
I've ruined my quick comeback.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.291
We've been
in this line so long,

04:08.335 --> 04:10.598
I've named all the butts
in front of us.

04:10.641 --> 04:14.341
Droopy, Lumpy, Kinda Hot,
Mean Pumpkin.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.734
And the loudmouth of
the group, Fart Butt.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.520
Please tell me I'm either
Kinda Hot or Mean Pumpkin.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.392
Come on, be honest
with yourself.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.655
That chairlift line
is moving just fine!

04:24.699 --> 04:26.266
Oh, hey, guys, I found you!

04:26.309 --> 04:27.528
Ew, Stan,

04:27.571 --> 04:29.660
what are those
Fashion Don'ts on your feet?

04:29.704 --> 04:32.097
My dad had these
custom-made for me

04:32.141 --> 04:34.752
from our neighbor's
very expensive fence material.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.276
What's going on with your line?

04:36.319 --> 04:38.365
- Nobody's even wearing skis!
- Don't need 'em!

04:38.408 --> 04:40.845
My crew is all about
"après ski,"

04:40.889 --> 04:43.370
the party scene after skiing.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.503
Except we also do it before
skiing and instead of skiing.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.549
We're heading up
to a sick mountaintop club.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.072
I got you all express passes!

04:50.115 --> 04:52.030
Nobody wants your party passes.

04:52.074 --> 04:54.381
We're here to ski
and name butts,

04:54.424 --> 04:56.470
and we're all out of butts.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.036
- I'll take a pass!
- Oh, great.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.951
Fart Butt gets to go up.

04:59.995 --> 05:03.085
So, Fart Butt, is that short
for Fartholomew Buttons?

05:05.783 --> 05:08.569
The ultimate home office.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.527
Pens to sign
important documents,

05:10.571 --> 05:12.877
paperclips to clip
those documents together,

05:12.921 --> 05:16.316
and, of course,
a big-ass landline phone.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.450
No dial tone?

05:20.494 --> 05:23.105
Time to call tech support
and unleash hell!

05:26.761 --> 05:29.241
<i>TeleStar support,</i> <i>

05:29.285 --> 05:31.896

05:44.082 --> 05:46.128

05:53.178 --> 05:54.745

so let's make the best of--

06:57.678 --> 06:59.810
Whoo-hoo! Hey!

07:01.203 --> 07:02.900
Damn it, these morons
are everywhere!

07:02.944 --> 07:05.947
Here, Stan, the traditional
peace offering of my people.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.122
Join us.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.865
I pity you, Roger.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.084
Everyone in this family
but you is content

07:13.128 --> 07:14.738
to enjoy
the wonders of nature.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.610
Stan, get over here!

07:16.653 --> 07:20.440
The bartender lady will spray
beer right in your face!

07:20.483 --> 07:22.659
I'm invoking vacation
veto power.

07:22.703 --> 07:25.357
Everyone get down here
and back in your skis!

07:33.714 --> 07:35.542
Sorry, y'all!

07:35.585 --> 07:40.024
Scratchin' ain't so easy
with m-m-m-mittens!

07:43.550 --> 07:47.031
Dad, this trip
sucks a fat hog.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.207
Climbing garbage
to get our skis?

07:49.251 --> 07:50.644
Can we just go home?

07:50.687 --> 07:52.515
Hey, I'm doing this
for you guys.

07:52.559 --> 07:53.864
I thought we could get away

07:53.908 --> 07:55.692
and find a little
quiet solitude.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.697
And beautiful views...

08:04.266 --> 08:06.224
... and a mountain breeze...

08:07.095 --> 08:09.924
Aaaaaah!

08:09.967 --> 08:11.752
You read my mind, Steve!

08:11.795 --> 08:14.319
The rustic family ski trip
we've all been craving

08:14.363 --> 08:16.583
is right here-- at the dump!

08:16.626 --> 08:17.671
Aaaaah!

08:17.714 --> 08:19.150
Unh!

08:28.943 --> 08:30.771
Cold penis!

08:30.814 --> 08:33.687
Steve, the dump won't be
a safe place to ski

08:33.730 --> 08:35.993
until you clear
the household appliances!

08:36.037 --> 08:37.908
Sorry, I was busy
getting this used condom

08:37.952 --> 08:39.040
out of my hair.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.563
A valid excuse.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.173
Honey, how's
the bunny slope coming?

08:42.217 --> 08:44.219
I think I found
some medical waste.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.569
That's the spirit!
My turn!

08:46.613 --> 08:47.744
Wheeeeee!

08:52.444 --> 08:55.360
Whoa. Cabin 3!

08:55.404 --> 08:57.624
These must be the logs
from the torn-down cabins

08:57.667 --> 08:58.712
I used to stay in!

08:58.755 --> 09:00.148
That's nice, Stan.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.411
So, the kids and I
have been talking,

09:02.454 --> 09:05.066
and maybe it's time we--

09:05.109 --> 09:06.241
Are you crying?

09:08.417 --> 09:10.506
It's just,
I wanna thank you for

09:10.550 --> 09:13.378
letting me give you the vacation
I've always wanted to.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.816
I love you guys.
Sorry. You were saying?

09:15.859 --> 09:17.295
Um...

09:17.339 --> 09:20.951
I was saying we should
stay here and keep...

09:20.995 --> 09:23.214
- trashin' it up.
- Great idea!

09:23.258 --> 09:25.739
Let's all reconstruct Cabin 3!

09:25.782 --> 09:29.177
You know who else built a cabin?
Abraham Lincoln.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.265
He also got shot in the head,

09:30.308 --> 09:32.093
but not everyone
gets that lucky.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.387
Sometimes I miss Steve
when he's on vacation,

10:05.430 --> 10:07.650
so I just come over
and live here.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.479
I'm going
a little crazy myself.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.350
Yesterday I made
a love connection

10:12.394 --> 10:13.656
with a tech-support babe,

10:13.700 --> 10:16.528
but we got disconnected,
and I can't find her.

10:16.572 --> 10:19.793
Klaus, this is your lucky day.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.969
Years of looking for
my deadbeat dad made me

10:22.012 --> 10:24.101
an expert tracker.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.321
Tell me about your call.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.932
Well, I was mad about my phone,

10:28.976 --> 10:30.934
and she was upset
it was raining--

10:30.978 --> 10:34.590
Stop. It only rained in nine
American cities yesterday.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.113
You put on a pot of coffee,

10:36.157 --> 10:38.594
I'll scrub my search history
from Steve's computer.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.552
We've got a girl to find.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.467
Guys, I've been thinking.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.426
Spraying champagne
is played out.

10:44.469 --> 10:45.645
It's time to innovate.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.565
Ha! Look at those losers
skiing on trash at the dump.

11:00.485 --> 11:03.140
Oh, no! Stan is ruining
their vacation.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.272
I have to save them!

11:04.315 --> 11:05.882
I'm innovating, too!

11:05.926 --> 11:07.492
Who wants a champagne enema?!

11:07.536 --> 11:08.711
A little later.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.670
I have to save them
a little later.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.461
Guess who christened
the outhouse.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.463
It was me!
I destroyed it!

11:21.506 --> 11:23.683
Everything's destroyed
here, Dad. It's a dump.

11:24.771 --> 11:28.122
The powder dump begins.

11:28.949 --> 11:32.169
Tomorrow, we shall ski
upon pillows of fairy dust.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.562
We'll need plenty of rest,

11:33.605 --> 11:35.607
so it's time for everyone
to go to sleep.

11:35.651 --> 11:38.741
But it's so early!
Nobody's tired!

11:38.785 --> 11:41.048
Don't worry, I found
a gasoline-soaked rag

11:41.091 --> 11:42.310
we can all share.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.138
I'll use it first,
and when I pass out,

11:44.181 --> 11:46.401
you can remove it
from my face so I don't die.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.533
Then the next person
will take it, pass out,

11:48.577 --> 11:50.884
and so forth
in a round-robin system.

11:50.927 --> 11:53.190
But what about the last person?

11:59.849 --> 12:01.372
A big snowball?

12:01.416 --> 12:02.765
Wait.
There's something in here.

12:06.290 --> 12:09.380
<i>"Dearest Smiths,</i> <i>
I bring news of a better life</i>

12:09.424 --> 12:11.426
<i>just a few hundred feet</i> <i>
above you,</i>

12:11.469 --> 12:13.907
<i>where the champagne</i> <i>
flows like wine,</i>

12:13.950 --> 12:16.474
<i>and the wine</i> <i>
also flows like wine.</i>

12:16.518 --> 12:19.086
<i>There's a lotta booze up here</i> <i>
is what I'm saying.</i>

12:19.129 --> 12:20.522
<i>And I have a plan.</i>

12:24.221 --> 12:27.485
Did you get my big snowball note
about the plan?!

12:29.966 --> 12:32.752
The rain rules out everything
west of the Mississippi,

12:32.795 --> 12:35.972
and TeleStar has no offices
north of Philadelphia.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.018
You said Sara called
you "sugar."

12:38.061 --> 12:40.455
In a Southern accent--
the sweet kind,

12:40.498 --> 12:42.065
not the swamp-person kind.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.807
What else?
I need details, damn it!

12:44.851 --> 12:46.940
She was super into me,

12:46.983 --> 12:49.290
practically trying to bang me
over the phone--

12:49.333 --> 12:51.466
No made-up details.

12:51.509 --> 12:52.510
Sorry, you didn't specify.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.818
I heard a train whistle!

12:57.951 --> 13:01.345
That's an Amtrak Viewliner 3850.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.870
Says here, "Only one left
in circulation,

13:03.913 --> 13:06.394
runs daily from
DC to Blacksburg."

13:06.437 --> 13:08.570
And at the time you called Sara,

13:08.613 --> 13:11.181
it was cruisin'
right through Roanoke.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.664
My true love works in Roanoke!

13:15.707 --> 13:17.100
They've got the best
Jersey Mike's!

13:17.144 --> 13:18.667
It's a match made in heaven!

13:27.719 --> 13:29.852
Whoa. We're getting dusted
pretty good.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.419
I should make sure
they can breathe.

13:33.421 --> 13:35.815
This isn't Steve at all!

13:35.858 --> 13:37.338
It's a snowsteve!

13:37.381 --> 13:39.557
A steveman? A stevesnow?

13:40.994 --> 13:42.647
Hayley? Jeff?

13:44.388 --> 13:45.868
Francine, the kids snuck out

13:45.912 --> 13:48.218
and replaced themselves
with snowkids!

13:48.262 --> 13:50.525
Kidmen? Snowsnows?

13:50.568 --> 13:51.482
We gotta find them.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.935
One, two, three...

14:08.978 --> 14:10.371
shot ski!

14:12.373 --> 14:14.331
You've all betrayed me!

14:14.375 --> 14:17.334
My plan worked!
Stan's ready to join the fun!

14:17.378 --> 14:20.337
I dunno.
He's kinda got murder face.

14:20.381 --> 14:24.341
Roger I get, but the rest of you
are blood relatives.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.387
Well, technically,
only Steve and Hayley are,

14:26.430 --> 14:28.345
but Francine and me
do it all the time,

14:28.389 --> 14:30.260
and Jeff and I
became blood brothers

14:30.304 --> 14:32.132
after we found that dead body
by the train tracks.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.660
Sorry we left you, Dad.
It's just...

14:38.703 --> 14:40.749
How do I say this?

14:40.792 --> 14:43.056
Your trip sucks, and après ski
is way more fun.

14:43.099 --> 14:44.535
That's exactly
how you say it.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.711
We tried to be nice, honey,

14:46.755 --> 14:48.583
but just because
you grew up poor

14:48.626 --> 14:50.933
and had to pretend to like
terrible vacations

14:50.977 --> 14:52.804
doesn't mean we have to.

14:52.848 --> 14:55.198
For the last time,
we weren't poor!

14:55.242 --> 14:58.158
We all shared one fork
to save time doing dishes!

14:58.201 --> 14:59.420
And I don't need any of you!

14:59.463 --> 15:01.683
I can do a family trip
all by myself!

15:03.511 --> 15:04.904
Wow, it's coming down heavy.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.603
I can't see the trail.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.780
Oh, God, I've lost my way!
I'm gonna die out here!

15:11.823 --> 15:13.738
Wait. There's a light.
I'm saved!

15:13.782 --> 15:15.088
Lord, you saved me!

15:18.265 --> 15:19.483
What?

15:25.141 --> 15:27.927
Who needs a loving family
to enjoy things with?

15:31.408 --> 15:34.368
Those fools have no idea
what they're missing.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.543
Whee!

15:36.283 --> 15:37.980
Yeah!

15:38.024 --> 15:39.939
Yes! Me!

15:40.591 --> 15:41.853
Whoo!

15:42.550 --> 15:44.508
Wake up, party people!

15:44.552 --> 15:48.991
MC Avalanche is cookin' up
fat beats and salty meats

15:49.035 --> 15:53.691
for your boozy brunchy pleasure!

15:53.735 --> 15:56.259
Mimosa time, bitches!

15:57.086 --> 15:58.870
Poor Stan.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.264
Will you ever find what
you've been looking for?

16:01.308 --> 16:04.050
This is exactly what
I've been looking for!

16:04.093 --> 16:06.835
Yee-haw!

16:06.878 --> 16:09.055
Haw-- Haw!

16:11.144 --> 16:12.797
Oh, God, oh, God!

16:14.451 --> 16:17.367
I'm doing it!
I'm outrunning the avalanche!

16:21.458 --> 16:24.418
Stan got buried by
an avalanche at the dump!

16:25.593 --> 16:27.116
<i>M-m-m-mittens!</i>

16:29.292 --> 16:30.815
Oh, my God!

16:30.859 --> 16:32.730
Après ski crew,

16:32.774 --> 16:35.646
I call on you to help us
find our missing friend!

16:41.870 --> 16:44.090
- Nah.
- Nah?

16:44.133 --> 16:45.743
Yeah, nah.
We wanna keep partying.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.883
This is the address.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.145
You sure you wanna do this?

16:56.189 --> 16:58.495
I'm good at figuring out
where people are

16:58.539 --> 17:02.021
but not so good at figuring out
where they are emotionally.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.632
If it's meant to be,
it's meant to be.

17:19.081 --> 17:22.780
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

17:46.195 --> 17:49.068
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.428
Not much air left.

18:02.429 --> 18:03.952
Must take...

18:03.995 --> 18:06.128
smallest breaths possible...

18:06.172 --> 18:07.303
because running out of air...

18:08.565 --> 18:09.958
let's just say...

18:10.001 --> 18:12.091
isn't the best outcome...

18:12.134 --> 18:13.179
for ol' Stan Smith.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.141
This ski trip sucks!

18:19.185 --> 18:20.838
Why doesn't our cabin
have any heat?

18:20.882 --> 18:24.146
Because we're getting away
from it all, that's why!

18:25.452 --> 18:27.497
Can't we go
to the regular zoo?

18:27.541 --> 18:30.152
This is better
than the regular zoo.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.415
The animals are in
their natural habitat.

18:35.549 --> 18:38.029
Stan, go check if there's
anything left in that.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.165
This cruise sucks!

18:43.209 --> 18:44.645
Why can't we leave our room?

18:44.688 --> 18:47.778
Because it's not
a real cruise, Stan!

18:47.822 --> 18:49.650
We're very, very poor!

18:49.693 --> 18:52.131
How the hell does this imbecile
not get it by now?!

18:54.133 --> 18:57.048
My childhood family trips...

18:57.092 --> 18:59.138
actually sucked!

18:59.181 --> 19:01.096
And there's a chance...

19:01.140 --> 19:03.054
we were kinda...

19:03.098 --> 19:04.143
poor.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.584
Stop après skiing and help me
find my papa!

19:12.412 --> 19:16.981
Hey, gang! You guys love
partying, we wanna search!

19:17.025 --> 19:19.288
What if we combine
the two and do...

19:19.332 --> 19:20.507
a search party?

19:25.338 --> 19:28.210
Search partyyyyyyyyyy!

19:28.254 --> 19:29.994
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

19:30.038 --> 19:32.519
- Yeah!
- I'm gonna be a hero!

19:38.307 --> 19:41.571
Après Squad, fan out
and find Stan!

19:42.833 --> 19:45.271
Par-tay!

19:45.314 --> 19:47.186
Whoo, yeah!

19:47.229 --> 19:48.622
Let's find Dan!

19:49.927 --> 19:50.972
Whoo!

19:52.321 --> 19:54.497
Oh, Stan.

19:54.541 --> 19:57.065
You only wanted us
to have a fun trip.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.200
Look! Dad's crappy
old wooden ski!

20:07.206 --> 20:08.990
Breathe, Dad!

20:09.033 --> 20:10.774
Breathe your stupid
fresh mountain air!

20:15.388 --> 20:17.738
- Life!
- Thanks, guys.

20:17.781 --> 20:20.219
You know, while I was
trapped in there,

20:20.262 --> 20:22.656
I had a lot of time
to hallucinate.

20:22.699 --> 20:25.441
I've been forcing this
crappy trip on all of you.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.269
I'm a failure as a parent.

20:27.313 --> 20:28.749
I wouldn't say that.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.360
Sure, they only had fun
because you drove them away,

20:31.404 --> 20:32.970
but you still gave them

20:33.014 --> 20:35.321
a better vacation
than you had growing up.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.584
I did, didn't I?

20:37.627 --> 20:41.762
I broke the vicious cycle of
having to take crappy vacations.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.721
Let's après skiiiiii!

20:44.765 --> 20:46.680
Hit it, MC Avalanche!

20:47.594 --> 20:50.161
I don't
think he's able to.

20:50.205 --> 20:53.948
Oh. Then maybe call
an ambulance!

20:55.079 --> 20:56.690
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
