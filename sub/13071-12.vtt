* Previously on BrainDead... *

00:40.808 --> 00:43.311
(sniffs)

00:48.816 --> 00:50.518
I...

00:50.551 --> 00:51.819
what?

00:52.820 --> 00:54.522
I thought you'd be happy.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.689
I don't know what I am.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.325
(scoffs)

00:57.358 --> 00:58.792
So, the CIA briefed you?

00:58.826 --> 01:01.495
Yeah, Bob Isenstadt,
the director's director.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.497
And said there are bugs
in people's brains?
Yes,

01:03.531 --> 01:05.166
everything you said.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.635
The real CIA?

01:07.668 --> 01:09.670
You're disappointed,
aren't you?

01:09.703 --> 01:11.805
Y-You wanted it to
just be your thing or...
No.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.375
No.
Look, i-it's about bugs,
Laurel.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.145
You were right,
I was wrong. Okay?

01:17.178 --> 01:18.712
Why did he
tell you this?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.281
It's a security briefing.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.749
The same thing
the presidential candidates get.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.184
Well, I still
don't get it.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.219
He needs us to stand down.
He--

01:25.253 --> 01:27.188
What does that mean?

01:27.221 --> 01:28.822
He needs you to stop
getting in the way.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.524
Look, they have a handle
on this.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.859
They're lying.
Okay,

01:31.892 --> 01:33.227
come on, Laurel. Stop it.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.828
Look, not everything's
a conspiracy.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.265
What are they doing? If they
have a handle on it, what is it?

01:37.298 --> 01:39.500
They were about to take
Red Wheatus into custody,

01:39.533 --> 01:41.135
but you and your friends
got in their way.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.204
You were doing something
with Red last night

01:43.237 --> 01:45.639
and it-it kept them
from taking him in.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.308
Were you doing something
with Red last night?

01:49.710 --> 01:52.613
Then, come on, you need
to stand down.

01:52.646 --> 01:56.150
Let the professionals
do their job.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.218
GUSTAV:
Nope!

01:57.251 --> 01:58.586
Uh-uh. I don't believe it.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.453
ROCHELLE:
Wait,

01:59.487 --> 02:01.322
what did he say exactly?
LAUREL: He said

02:01.355 --> 02:03.557
the CIA is on top of it,
and we're getting in their way.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.194
That doesn't even
make any sense.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.628
How are we getting in their way?

02:07.661 --> 02:09.630
We warned Red by trying
to kill the bug in his head.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.432
But why can't they
arrest him anyway?

02:11.465 --> 02:13.501
Actually,

02:13.534 --> 02:15.336
that is a good point.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.471
Thank you.
I don't know.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.872
But this a good thing.
I mean, they know.

02:18.906 --> 02:19.873
They're pursuing it.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.242
Do you believe that?

02:21.275 --> 02:23.211
Well, what's the alternative?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.478
The CIA director is infected.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.914
What do we do?

02:26.947 --> 02:28.216
(sighs)

02:28.249 --> 02:29.583
We still need to get to Red.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.751
He's got the queen in his head.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.886
The injured queen.
You hit it.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.855
Yeah, but I don't think
that made a difference.
It might have.

02:34.888 --> 02:35.923
It might have.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.493
The CIA is worried.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.794
That's why they're
trying to stop us.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.530
We got too close.
Look,

02:42.563 --> 02:44.332
Red offered you money
for your documentary.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.634
Why don't you
meet with him

02:46.667 --> 02:48.536
to discuss it?
Right. And then,

02:48.569 --> 02:50.371
we can get him
to give up the queen again.

02:52.806 --> 02:57.211
Combined receipts
and expenditure accounts,

02:57.245 --> 02:59.480
uh, established to temporarily

02:59.513 --> 03:02.516
hold funds
which are later refunded

03:02.550 --> 03:04.518
or paid into another...

03:05.686 --> 03:07.255
(panting)

03:07.288 --> 03:08.256
Senator?

03:08.289 --> 03:09.257
(groans)

03:09.290 --> 03:10.558
What do you have?

03:10.591 --> 03:12.826
It's a swamp,
it's a language swamp.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.563
There's something
in the farming authorization,

03:15.596 --> 03:16.564
but I need time.
I don't have time.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.898
I need to argue right now.
Just give me a day.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.367
I'll have the thing
they're hiding.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.602
(gavel bangs)
I can't ask
for another day.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.272
This budget
is a dialectic work of art.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.607
Stop talking about art,
and just do it.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.542
ELLA:
Uh, Madam Chairwoman, I would
like to ask the committee

03:28.576 --> 03:30.644
if we could...
My apologies,

03:30.678 --> 03:32.946
Madam Chairman,
I have a quick issue.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.915
I-I was hoping to argue
for a vote.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.417
Just one quick thing, ma'am.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.720
Uh, today is the day
when we honor...

03:39.753 --> 03:43.324
Native American Iraqi War
veterans.

03:43.357 --> 03:46.394
And I would argue that we

03:46.427 --> 03:49.463
delay all budgetary business
for another day,

03:49.497 --> 03:51.499
a day when
we are not honoring

03:51.532 --> 03:54.001
Iraqi War veterans
who are Native American.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.002
Now, many of us

03:55.035 --> 03:56.904
have to rush to,

03:56.937 --> 03:59.039
uh, church services from here.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.641
Senator Wheatus.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.943
Yes?

04:02.976 --> 04:05.513
You have your hand up.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.716
(cameras click)

04:08.749 --> 04:09.717
Yes.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.586
I just want to say,

04:12.620 --> 04:16.290
I think we should vote today

04:16.324 --> 04:18.359
because...

04:20.994 --> 04:22.062
...you know.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.064
DIANE:
Uh,

04:24.097 --> 04:26.567
in the spirit of compassion

04:26.600 --> 04:29.870
and deference to
our wounded warriors

04:29.903 --> 04:32.473
of the Indian-- uh, uh,

04:32.506 --> 04:35.309
of the, uh, Native American,

04:35.343 --> 04:39.480
uh, persuasion, I suggest
that we delay

04:39.513 --> 04:41.014
until tomorrow.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.651
(groans)

04:45.886 --> 04:47.755
(sighs)

04:47.788 --> 04:50.858
(groaning)

04:50.891 --> 04:54.528
(whimpers)

05:01.369 --> 05:02.970
(grunts)

05:04.472 --> 05:06.407
Oh, my God.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.675
What was that?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.843
What was what?
Your performance.

05:09.877 --> 05:13.046
We've only got 12 days left.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.382
We don't have
a day to spare!

05:14.415 --> 05:15.649
Don't you think I knew that?

05:15.683 --> 05:16.950
You're weak.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.652
You're falling apart.

05:18.686 --> 05:19.787
Look at your queen.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.821
She's dying.

05:20.854 --> 05:21.855
Get out of here!

05:21.889 --> 05:24.057
You can't hack it anymore.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.058
(scoffs)

05:25.092 --> 05:26.093
I'm taking over.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.130
Over my dead body.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.932
This isn't about you and me.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.668
If we fight amongst ourselves,
they win.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.136
Exactly.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.472
So back the hell off!

05:38.506 --> 05:40.608
This should be fought
by the powerful.

05:40.641 --> 05:44.111
Not a man who can't get
five words out without crying!

05:44.144 --> 05:46.714
Get out. Get out!

05:50.050 --> 05:53.421
Don't worry.
She's not getting near you.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.588
Wait, wait.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.690
Where is footnote 289?

05:56.724 --> 05:57.691
Who's got it?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.860
2024 budget window.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.028
Defer for later pay.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.095
Oh, here, I've got it.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.631
Good. Good.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.899
What does it say?
Uh, "Full funding

06:05.933 --> 06:08.736
"for the LWCF programs
in the DOI and USDA,

06:08.769 --> 06:10.738
see footnote 345."

06:10.771 --> 06:12.973
Ha. They're hop-scotching us.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.943
That's when you know you are
on to something,

06:15.976 --> 06:17.578
when they force you to go

06:17.611 --> 06:18.812
from footnote to footnote!

06:18.846 --> 06:20.848
Who's got 345?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.683
Jake?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.051
What are you doing here?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.919
Thought I'd bring you something
from L.A.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.722
So, it's weird to think of you
with an office.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.191
Yeah, nothing like working
out of my kitchen in L.A.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.460
(both chuckle)

06:32.493 --> 06:33.561
So, champagne?

06:33.594 --> 06:34.628
You'll never guess what.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.996
What?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.130
We got funding.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.165
What?
For the Solomon Islands.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.633
We got the money to finish it.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.534
Wh-- are you kidding?

06:40.568 --> 06:42.135
I me-- how--
w-where did it come from?

06:42.169 --> 06:42.903
A foundation
against global warming.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.673
We can finally finish it.
(laughs)

06:47.641 --> 06:48.609
So, um,

06:48.642 --> 06:49.577
I worked up a new schedule.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.678
We need to commence
in the next three weeks.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.846
Uh, we want to be there
for the music festival, right?

06:52.880 --> 06:55.082
Right, right. So, how much
do we have to work with?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.817
You won't believe it.
They gave us more than we asked.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.752
$2 million.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.890
I know, $2 million.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.859
What foundation is this, Jake?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.795
Uh, The Ocean League?
They're legit.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.131
Did you go to them,
or did they come to you?

07:11.164 --> 07:12.199
Uh, a bit of both.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.601
They saw your
Kickstarter campaign

07:13.634 --> 07:15.168
and came to me.
Why, what's wrong?

07:15.202 --> 07:16.770
Are you saying we need
to start in three weeks,

07:16.804 --> 07:18.672
or are they saying it?
They are.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.773
They-they want to use it
as part of a series

07:19.807 --> 07:20.941
of global warming films,

07:20.974 --> 07:22.743
about the impact
on the most vulnerable.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.044
Why?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.078
They're trying to get rid of me.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.147
Uh, excuse me?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.750
Okay. Tell them
we'll take the money,

07:29.783 --> 07:31.519
but only if we can start
in six months.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.754
What?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.188
Why? Laurel,
this is your chance.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.490
This is what you
were always after.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.791
You can finally
finish it.

07:37.825 --> 07:38.826
I have an obligation here.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.628
Ah, come on. Here in D.C.?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.530
You kidding me? It's just
a bunch fat politicians

07:42.563 --> 07:43.564
talking to each other.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.699
Come on, the Solomon Islands?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.769
Thanks, Jake. I have to go.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.938
What? But why?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.945
The answer is no.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.948
I really need to get
a lock on that door.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.883
I don't care if you pay me
$2 million or $5 million,

08:02.916 --> 08:04.151
you can't get rid of me.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.919
Good to know.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.622
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

08:08.656 --> 08:09.623
The Ocean League?

08:09.657 --> 08:10.724
Are you kidding me?

08:10.758 --> 08:12.560
Do you mind?
I'm trying to nap!

08:12.593 --> 08:15.929
Is everything all right,
Senator?

08:15.963 --> 08:19.933
Oh, yeah, sure,
let's have everyone come on in.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.569
Let's-- let's all hold hands.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.704
Is everything okay?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.573
I don't know. Ask your boss.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.607
He wants me gone.

08:29.577 --> 08:33.781
(whimpering): I don't know
what she's talking about.

08:33.814 --> 08:37.284
(Melanesian Choir music plays)

08:55.936 --> 08:58.538
(Melanesian Choir music
continues)

09:19.993 --> 09:23.731
*

09:27.801 --> 09:29.770
What did she say?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.171
She wanted to meet.

09:31.204 --> 09:34.107
It's probably about Red,
our next attack.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.776
Yeah, probably.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.712
You want to go out?

09:38.746 --> 09:40.180
(laughs)

09:40.213 --> 09:41.715
What?

09:41.749 --> 09:44.017
Would you like to go
somewhere amusing?

09:44.051 --> 09:46.319
You live in
a basement apartment, Gustav.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.655
So it's about money?

09:47.688 --> 09:48.922
No, I...

09:48.956 --> 09:51.759
we are just very different.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.360
And I have a boyfriend.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.063
I haven't seen him.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.064
I don't share everything
with you.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.065
LAUREL:
Hi, guys.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.132
Thanks.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.668
Ah, no problem.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.670
Rochelle just kicked me
in the groin, but sure.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.671
What's up?

10:03.704 --> 10:04.738
Do you want me to come back?

10:04.772 --> 10:06.039
ROCHELLE:
No.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.641
What do you do with Red?

10:07.675 --> 10:08.876
Do we try to get
the queen out again?

10:08.909 --> 10:11.244
No. Um...

10:11.278 --> 10:12.646
I don't know.
Oh, God.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.847
Don't tell me you think
we should

10:13.881 --> 10:15.248
let the CIA handle this?

10:15.282 --> 10:16.717
No.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.386
But you do, though?
No,

10:19.419 --> 10:20.921
I just mean,

10:20.954 --> 10:22.022
what can we do?

10:22.055 --> 10:23.423
We've tried everything we could.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.658
When we didn't have
the medical facilities,

10:24.692 --> 10:25.859
we went to the CDC.
Yes,

10:25.893 --> 10:27.728
and look how that turned out.

10:27.761 --> 10:28.762
But still, what can we do?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.063
We kill Red.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.298
ROCHELLE:
Oh, my God, you're kidding.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.299
We wait until
he's heading home,

10:32.332 --> 10:33.767
and we run our car over him.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.268
ROCHELLE:
You don't have a car.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.204
Well ,then we run
your car over him.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.939
We have to kill
the bug in his head.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.741
Am I the only one
taking this seriously?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.743
Okay, I'm out.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.945
What?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.146
I'm done.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.348
Wait, what does that mean?

10:48.381 --> 10:50.083
It means...

10:50.117 --> 10:52.085
if we are facing
the end of the world,

10:52.119 --> 10:54.321
then we can't do it on our own.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.323
ROCHELLE: You think
we should rely on the CIA?
No.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.759
She means
she's done with us.
Oh, come on, Gustav.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.294
You're just as likely
to want to do this on your own

11:01.328 --> 11:03.697
because of your paranoia.
Is that what you think?

11:03.731 --> 11:05.699
I think we should just let...
No, I think you push things

11:05.733 --> 11:06.900
to support your paranoid view
of the world.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.136
Okay.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.038
Go to hell.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.873
Yeah, that's where
this was always headed.
Hey, guys...

11:12.906 --> 11:15.242
No, no, no, no, I am done.

11:15.275 --> 11:19.346
Yeah, good talking to you.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.251
Jake, hi.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.020
Tell the Ocean League,
we'll do it.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.872
I mean, look, I understand
trying to stop this budget

11:44.905 --> 11:47.474
if it's about this bigger
issue, this bug issue,

11:47.507 --> 11:49.777
and, yes, I still find
it odd to talk that way,

11:49.810 --> 11:51.311
but isn't your brother just
trying to stop this budget

11:51.344 --> 11:53.013
because he's a liberal?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.815
What?

11:54.848 --> 11:56.449
Isn't this just a liberal issue?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.418
I mean, no matter what's going
on, you and I still disagree.

11:58.451 --> 12:01.421
I'm sorry, I'm still having
trouble following.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.890
I'm a conservative.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.157
You're a liberal.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.794
Our priorities are... different.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.530
I got the money
for my documentary

12:10.563 --> 12:13.200
What documentary?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.435
No, I mean,
which of the documentaries?

12:15.468 --> 12:16.837
The yodeling one?

12:16.870 --> 12:18.038
Melanesian Choir.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.239
Great.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.875
Congratulations.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.877
I need to start in three weeks.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.080
So you're leaving?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.184
I just, I never finish anything.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.087
And I can't keep creating
excuses to not do what I love.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.023
So these bugs
are just an excuse?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.558
No, but the CIA is on it.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.193
And they briefed my brother
Mm.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.528
and said that I should
stop getting involved,

12:41.561 --> 12:43.797
that I'm not doing
anybody any good.

12:43.831 --> 12:47.134
So I-I need to take this chance.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.336
So you're leaving
in three weeks?

12:49.369 --> 12:51.104
Yeah.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.406
No, um...

12:53.440 --> 12:55.108
a week.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.010
Ah.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.279
(chuckles)

12:59.312 --> 13:01.815
I'll be back.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.483
And then...

13:03.516 --> 13:07.220
What?

13:07.254 --> 13:09.356
I don't know,
if-if you still...

13:09.389 --> 13:12.092
if we still like
each other, then...

13:12.125 --> 13:13.593
We'll...

13:13.626 --> 13:15.829
I don't know, we can-we can
move in together,

13:15.863 --> 13:18.531
or whatever,
whatever you want...

13:18.565 --> 13:20.267
(phone buzzing)

13:24.171 --> 13:26.006
It's the senator,
I have to get back.

13:26.039 --> 13:29.309
We'll talk later.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.284
RED (weakly):
Gareth?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.386
You're back.

13:39.419 --> 13:43.023
Senator?

13:43.056 --> 13:45.425
(groans softly)

13:45.458 --> 13:46.994
They're coming after me.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.228
Are you sick, sir?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.864
They-they smell weakness on me.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.100
They think they can
take me down.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.236
Just because I'm not feeling
too well.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.305
We need to get you to a doctor.
N-no!

13:58.338 --> 13:59.539
No doctors.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.642
I need you to save me, Gareth.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.311
Please.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.546
We used to be close.

14:06.579 --> 14:10.183
When I'd drop the ball,
you'd pick it up.

14:10.217 --> 14:13.153
W-What happened to those days?
Senator,

14:13.186 --> 14:14.854
I'm not sure I can help you.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.257
I need you now.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.892
More than ever.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.293
That's a strong grip.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.996
The committee meets again
this afternoon.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.498
And Ella is out for blood.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.568
You'll get me through, okay?

14:28.601 --> 14:31.371
Use your...
you'll write me a script.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.540
(chuckles)
Like you used to do.

14:33.573 --> 14:37.978
Yeah, and I want you right there
behind me the whole time,

14:38.011 --> 14:39.546
making me look good.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.514
We'll go full Strom Thurmond
on this. (chuckles)

14:41.548 --> 14:44.151
You know?
Senator...

14:44.184 --> 14:45.585
No, no, just-just promise.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.187
The people will know.
Promise me!

14:47.220 --> 14:50.223
Why are you doing this, Senator?

14:50.257 --> 14:51.424
What's the goal?

14:51.458 --> 14:52.993
Survival.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.528
Survival of who?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.132
Whom.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.572
LUKE:
You actually typed this?

15:05.605 --> 15:07.074
I thought that was the protocol.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.375
Since when did you worry
about protocol?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.643
I want to do this right.
Well, I appreciate that.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.045
So, you accept my resignation?

15:12.079 --> 15:13.446
No.
Luke...

15:13.480 --> 15:15.515
Look, you can't go now.
I don't belong here.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.051
Well, I beg to differ. Look
how much you've accomplished.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.452
I don't even know what
I'm doing half the time.

15:19.486 --> 15:20.653
Well, that's a lot better

15:20.687 --> 15:22.122
than most of the people
around here.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.524
Luke, I want to make my movie.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.159
Laurel...

15:32.765 --> 15:34.467
Let's just get
to the bottom of the budget.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.037
Then you can go.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.138
And when's that?

15:38.171 --> 15:38.972
Soon.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.573
Just don't leave me
in the lurch.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.710
(weakly): I believe, as all
conservatives believe,

15:43.743 --> 15:47.747
nay, as all Americans
believe,

15:47.780 --> 15:51.218
this budget is essential.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.586
Now, I argue

15:53.620 --> 15:56.723
that we c...
(garbled gibberish)

16:00.793 --> 16:06.099
That we should discontinue
debate and vote on this budget.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.002
'Cause the American people
are waiting

16:09.036 --> 16:12.272
for us to do our damn job.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.773
ELLA:
Madam Chairwoman,

16:13.806 --> 16:15.775
as per Article 1, section 5,

16:15.808 --> 16:18.578
clause 2 of the Constitution,

16:18.611 --> 16:21.248
I would ask that this committee
to dismiss Senator Wheatus

16:21.281 --> 16:23.116
from his committee
chair, due to his obvious

16:23.150 --> 16:26.153
health issues.
DIANE:
I would entertain a vote.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.787
At this point...
Uh, Madam.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.023
Madam Chairwoman, I object.

16:30.057 --> 16:33.393
I would like to remind you
that you intend to be

16:33.426 --> 16:36.663
absent from this committee

16:36.696 --> 16:41.268
in order to procure
a Chinese labia...

16:41.301 --> 16:43.803
I-in order to adopt
a Chinese baby.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.039
ELLA:
That is very different, Madam.

16:46.073 --> 16:49.042
Your absence has a finite date.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.611
Senator Wheatus's
sickness does not have

16:51.644 --> 16:55.148
the same start and stop date.
RED: Senator Pollack is correct.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.084
I am recovering.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.451
But only because I had...

16:58.485 --> 17:01.054
a proctology exam.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.589
(voice breaking):
This is an exam

17:02.622 --> 17:04.691
that I would encourage
all members

17:04.724 --> 17:06.159
to undertake.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.061
Come on, Red. You're sick.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.496
Stop pretending that you're not.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.065
I am no more sick

17:12.099 --> 17:14.334
than 65% of men my age.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.570
And I must ask
my esteemed colleague

17:17.604 --> 17:21.074
where is her compression?

17:21.108 --> 17:22.375
(whispers)
Compassion.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.510
Oh, my God.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.049
(Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro
playing)

17:37.557 --> 17:40.427
*

17:45.198 --> 17:46.699
What's up?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.335
What are you listening to?

17:48.368 --> 17:50.137
Figaro.
I just wanted
to remind you

17:50.170 --> 17:52.605
that if it weren't for
the Republicans, we could have

17:52.639 --> 17:54.574
Kaufmann, Bartoli
and Terfel here all the time.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.209
What do you need, Ella?

17:56.243 --> 17:58.411
There's a Republican senator...
I thought we were

17:58.445 --> 18:00.747
on the same side
as the Republicans these days.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.682
I thought so, too,
but do you want Trump

18:02.715 --> 18:04.251
for president?
Hillary's just as bad.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.652
Not for art subsidies.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.889
Red Wheatus has
a chief of staff.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.358
I need you to deal with him.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.460
He's been propping Red up.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.263
Okay.
What's his name?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.332
Yeah?

18:19.366 --> 18:20.333
Alcohol.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.669
(laughing):
I need alcohol.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.904
Are you losing it?
No, no.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.373
I'm finding it.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.276
Ah!

18:29.309 --> 18:30.543
Cooks.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.146
Champagne on a budget--
I love it.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.151
You're not
worried about glass?

18:38.185 --> 18:40.487
What are you talking about?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.255
In the champagne-- glass.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.524
Do you not worry?
Oh, no.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.626
Glass in the budget.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.528
What?

18:48.561 --> 18:50.763
Drink.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.701
Paragraph 1403, sub-paragraph
6, footnote 11: "A provision

18:54.734 --> 18:58.271
to purchase $108 million
worth of glass."

18:58.305 --> 18:59.406
Why?

18:59.439 --> 19:00.673
I don't know.
And this is for

19:00.707 --> 19:01.908
the internment camps
in the farm bill?

19:01.941 --> 19:04.277
Yes, apparently,
they tried to hide it

19:04.311 --> 19:06.513
under the rubric
of budgetary windows.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.182
But, epiphany,
it's a real window.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.386
Do internment camps have
many windows?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.688
No, the whole point
is not to have windows.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.724
That list of sites
for the camps,

19:17.757 --> 19:19.626
which one was closest,
do you remember?

19:19.659 --> 19:20.727
Of course I do.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.828
My memory is almost
photographic.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.197
Well, more like
an artist's rendering.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.465
Manassas, Virginia.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.599
It's about an hour from here.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.535
You want
to go on a field trip?

19:28.568 --> 19:30.503
To Manassas?
Yes.

19:30.537 --> 19:31.438
I have one week
left here.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.206
I want to make it count.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.246
STOCKWELL:
The problem is the credit
card function only gives you

19:39.279 --> 19:42.249
the option of a 20% or more tip.
What if I want to leave less?!

19:42.282 --> 19:44.917
It's the little indignities
of life!

19:47.387 --> 19:49.422
They're very clean.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.823
May I help you?

19:53.893 --> 19:55.828
Hi. My name's Laurel
Healy. This is...

19:55.862 --> 19:57.364
Hardy.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.798
We work for
Senator Healy.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.801
Hardy is the senator's...
chief of staff.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.570
Hello. How are you?

20:03.603 --> 20:05.805
Good. It's
about time somebody

20:05.838 --> 20:07.807
came out here
to check on things.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.710
This whole thing
is so messed up.
Well, you know,

20:10.743 --> 20:12.412
we're doing our best.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.414
Messed up how?
Well, the plumbing,

20:14.447 --> 20:17.417
for one thing. I keep telling
them it's not adequate.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.487
We got pipes for a sprinkler
system but no bathrooms.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.423
Very disappointing.
And I don't care
what else is going on.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.758
Where are people gonna do
their business?

20:25.792 --> 20:27.327
The plans say each building

20:27.360 --> 20:29.329
is supposed to hold 500 beds.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.631
FOREMAN:
Yeah, tell me about it.
I got 30 truckloads

20:31.664 --> 20:33.966
of potting soil
arriving on Thursday.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.003
We haven't even put up
all the glass roofs yet.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.950
They're not internment camps.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.653
There you are. I thought
I told you to stay at your desk.

20:53.686 --> 20:54.987
They're hothouses.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.823
They're not gonna
be filled with beds.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.858
They're flower beds,
to grow cherry blossoms.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.728
What are you talking about?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.796
That's how the bugs spread.
They're building hothouses

21:03.830 --> 21:05.298
all over the country
so they can take over.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.966
And they're using federal money.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.968
They need the cherry blossoms.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.438
Oh, God.
What? Luke,
you need to tell

21:11.471 --> 21:12.705
the CIA about this.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.441
They said they've
got it under control.
Yes.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.975
But do they know this?
Do they know it's not just D.C.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.744
It's in 80 towns
in every state?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.679
Laurel, you're leaving.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.013
Just leave it to them.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.482
Luke, tell them.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.717
This could be about America,
not just D.C.

21:24.751 --> 21:25.852
(knocking)

21:33.660 --> 21:35.362
Okay.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.363
Got it.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.864
Luke, tell them.

21:37.897 --> 21:38.898
I will.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.668
Go see your boyfriend.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.372
Hey.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.906
You been drinking?

21:46.939 --> 21:48.375
I have.
A bit.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.709
Little bit.

21:49.742 --> 21:50.877
This much.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.044
You want me
to get you an Uber?

21:52.078 --> 21:54.046
No.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.782
I needed to ask you something.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.750
Sure, what?

21:57.784 --> 21:59.386
It's gonna sound wrong.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.653
But you're leaving,

22:00.687 --> 22:02.689
so... it's okay.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.592
Okay.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.429
Marry me.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.966
Excuse me?

22:15.101 --> 22:17.404
Marry me.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.739
And...

22:19.772 --> 22:23.543
I'm going now.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.112
Bye.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.063
Senator, hello.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.432
They said
you wanted to see me?

22:45.465 --> 22:46.933
Yes, thank you
for making time.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.968
I have nothing
but time, Senator.
Good.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.538
Well, uh, this is
regarding our subject

22:51.571 --> 22:53.105
from the other day.
Yes?

22:53.139 --> 22:56.676
Uh, my sister has discovered
a plan to insert funding

22:56.709 --> 23:00.012
for 80 hothouses
in the federal farming bill.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.853
Well, it seems
they're transporting

23:06.886 --> 23:08.688
cherry blossoms
across state lines,

23:08.721 --> 23:11.057
and I was just making sure
you were aware of it.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.825
(chuckles)

23:12.859 --> 23:15.762
I thought I asked you and your
sister to stand down, Senator.

23:15.795 --> 23:16.796
Uh, yes.

23:16.829 --> 23:17.864
And we were,

23:17.897 --> 23:20.199
but this information came up

23:20.232 --> 23:21.367
and...

23:21.400 --> 23:24.136
Senator, you take your job
very seriously, I see that.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.172
I take my job
seriously, too.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.108
I would never pretend
to do your job.

23:29.141 --> 23:32.211
Please extend me
the same courtesy.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.880
Good seeing you.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.615
This is my job, Director.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.484
And this funding

23:37.517 --> 23:38.651
is in the farming bill.

23:38.685 --> 23:39.686
We're voting
on this bill today.

23:39.719 --> 23:40.887
We have it under control.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.055
So you knew about it?
We did.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.957
And thank you for coming in.

23:46.158 --> 23:49.028
One more thing, Director.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.865
Yes, Senator?

23:52.899 --> 23:55.702
Did you also know these bugs
are considering ways

23:55.735 --> 23:57.970
to infiltrate our water supply?

23:58.004 --> 24:01.508
Yes, Senator,
we're on top of that, too.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.043
Please.

24:04.076 --> 24:07.013
Allow us to do our job.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.015
(door opens)

24:09.048 --> 24:11.651
(door closes)

24:25.532 --> 24:27.534
(door opens)

24:28.234 --> 24:29.201
Hey.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.270
Hey.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.939
What's going on?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.040
Nothing.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.642
Just waiting for you.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.910
With my wedding photo
in your lap?

24:37.944 --> 24:39.512
Yeah.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.647
Hmm.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.181
That was a good day.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.050
(sighs)
It was.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.152
Did you tell
the CIA?

24:46.185 --> 24:47.920
Yep.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.055
And?

24:49.088 --> 24:52.559
The CIA is lying.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.527
They don't want me
to get involved.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.928
Why?

24:55.962 --> 24:57.564
Because they're afraid of what
I'll do with the budget.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.566
Why do you say that?

24:59.599 --> 25:01.568
Well, I-I told them
about the hothouses.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.969
They said they were
on top of it.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.004
Maybe they are. I mean,
maybe we should just let them...

25:05.037 --> 25:07.173
No, no, I made up
something, too.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.642
The bugs infecting
the water supply.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.144
They said they were
on top of that, also.

25:13.713 --> 25:16.282
What are you gonna do?

25:16.315 --> 25:18.618
Get mad.

25:18.651 --> 25:19.619
(quiet laugh)

25:19.652 --> 25:20.653
Does that help?

25:20.687 --> 25:21.954
It can.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.222
Who are you calling?

25:23.255 --> 25:24.557
Dad.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.058
Why?

25:26.092 --> 25:28.695
To get his advice.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.063
You can't.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.599
Why not?

25:37.704 --> 25:39.338
Luke, what's up?

25:39.371 --> 25:41.040
Let me see
your hand, Dad.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.074
What do you mean?

25:42.108 --> 25:43.275
Put your hand up.

25:43.309 --> 25:47.313
Why?
(laughs)

25:47.346 --> 25:49.782
It's getting
a little better.

25:49.816 --> 25:50.783
Stop it.

25:50.817 --> 25:51.951
Whoa, stop what?

25:51.984 --> 25:53.085
You're not sick.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.688
Stop it!

25:55.722 --> 25:58.758
Ah, the medication's
getting a lot better.

25:59.959 --> 26:03.329
What has your sister
been telling you?

26:03.362 --> 26:06.866
Fairy tales, Luke?

26:06.899 --> 26:08.234
You're the pragmatist.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.670
She's a dreamer.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.606
Bunch of sci-fi nonsense.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.007
Oh, my God.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.109
What?

26:17.143 --> 26:18.978
Talk to me.
I'm right here.
No.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.279
No...

26:20.312 --> 26:22.281
I'm on my own.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.127
You don't want me
as an enemy.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.829
I don't want it.

26:36.863 --> 26:39.899
But I guess it just is.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.233
(gavel bangs)

26:41.267 --> 26:44.236
DIANE:
The time allotted
for debate on this matter

26:44.270 --> 26:48.407
has come to an end, so if no one
has anything to add...

26:48.440 --> 26:50.743
Madam Chairwoman,
I'd like to say something.

26:50.777 --> 26:51.911
Oh, for God's sake.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.145
DIANE:
Senator Healy,

26:53.179 --> 26:55.114
I'll give you three minutes.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.216
(sighs)

26:59.786 --> 27:03.389
Now, we all know
this budget is being

27:03.422 --> 27:06.693
shoved down the American
people's throats in the hopes

27:06.726 --> 27:09.395
that if we look like we're
doing something, anything,

27:09.428 --> 27:11.931
no matter how ill-conceived,

27:11.964 --> 27:14.333
they'll shut up
and stop asking questions.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.704
But our job is
to ask questions.

27:17.737 --> 27:21.373
Questions like what are
these structures being built

27:21.407 --> 27:24.210
with money for farm subsidies?

27:24.243 --> 27:27.246
Why are they made with
tons of expensive glass?

27:27.279 --> 27:29.348
Now, how can we take a vote

27:29.381 --> 27:31.884
until we know the answer
to those questions?

27:31.918 --> 27:35.087
Now, I say we carve out
the farm provisions

27:35.121 --> 27:37.089
from the overall budget
and open them up

27:37.123 --> 27:39.125
for debate and amendment.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.761
This is just a delay tactic.
I'm trying to get at the truth!

27:41.794 --> 27:44.230
(gallery murmuring)

27:44.263 --> 27:48.034
Now, if Senator Wheatus
and Senator Pollack,

27:48.067 --> 27:50.102
who helped craft
this legislation,

27:50.136 --> 27:52.104
would like to explain
it to all of us,

27:52.138 --> 27:54.306
then I would be
happy to listen.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.875
RED:
Those buildings

27:55.908 --> 27:59.411

27:59.445 --> 28:02.148
"Secret."
Why secret?

28:02.181 --> 28:04.784
(gallery murmuring)

28:10.489 --> 28:12.124
Why not secret?

28:12.158 --> 28:13.893
DIANE:
I think,

28:13.926 --> 28:16.896
in light of Senator Healy's
concerns,

28:16.929 --> 28:18.430
we should consider

28:18.464 --> 28:23.069
carving out the section
concerning farm provisions.

I'm fine.
Oh, my God.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.172
Don't worry, it was
just a random mugging.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.306
With a knife?

30:07.339 --> 30:08.540
Yeah, he just
nicked the bone.

30:08.574 --> 30:09.575
What happened?

30:09.608 --> 30:10.943
I don't know.

30:10.977 --> 30:11.810
Some guy, some nut.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.445
I was working late
and he, you know?

30:13.479 --> 30:15.014
Tried to kill you.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.916
No.
I don't know.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.150
Well, did they catch him?

30:18.184 --> 30:19.385
No, he ran off.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.921

30:21.954 --> 30:23.622
My parents are coming in.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.958
Can you believe it?
That's just what I need.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.026
What can I do?
Nothing.

30:27.059 --> 30:27.994
I'm out of here
in a few hours.

30:28.027 --> 30:32.031
They don't like keeping
you in the hospital.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.599
I gave the police
my statement.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.334
Don't pity me, please.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.503
It'll only make it worse.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.105
I'm not pitying you.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.473
Just the last time
we talked,

30:41.507 --> 30:44.443
you... you asked me
to marry you.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.112
I was drinking.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.380
I was just joking.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.918
Oh.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.353
I didn't, I-I didn't know.

30:54.386 --> 30:57.389
No, I mean, it makes no sense
with everything and our jobs.

31:00.292 --> 31:04.230
When I got the call
I was worried.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.098
I thought you died.

31:06.132 --> 31:09.068
I have an extreme
sense of drama.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.971
A cop's last day
is the day he gets shot.

31:12.004 --> 31:16.542
The day you ask me to marry you
is the day you get stabbed.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.045
It was a joke.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.483
Come with me.

31:24.516 --> 31:25.952
What?

31:25.985 --> 31:27.053
To the Solomon Islands.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.187
Come with me.
Help me.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.922
Help you what?

31:29.956 --> 31:32.391
Make my documentary.

31:34.626 --> 31:35.995
What?

31:36.028 --> 31:37.997
In a grass hut,

31:38.030 --> 31:40.532
cooking you plantains
on an open fire?

31:40.566 --> 31:41.900
No.

31:43.102 --> 31:45.237
That wouldn't be bad, would it?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.045
I'm not doing that, Laurel.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.381
I can't be your...

31:57.316 --> 32:00.152
...kept man.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.920
I'm not that person.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.624
Then what do we do?

32:06.658 --> 32:08.995
We do what we need to do.

32:09.028 --> 32:12.464
I need to stay and...

32:14.200 --> 32:16.068
...you need to go.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.672
Senator Healy.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.509
Director Isenstadt, hello.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.177
What are you doing here?
Talking to you, Senator.

32:25.211 --> 32:28.147
The mountain is coming
to Muhammad.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.982
Ah, should the mountain
be worried or honored?

32:30.016 --> 32:32.284
Actually, you're Muhammad
in this equation.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.086
I'm the mountain.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.188
Well...

32:36.222 --> 32:37.589
would the mountain like to sit?

32:37.623 --> 32:38.590
Take a load off?

32:38.624 --> 32:40.592
What the hell are you doing?

32:40.626 --> 32:43.129
I told you
to stand down.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.463
I told you twice to stand down.

32:44.496 --> 32:45.531
Yes.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.033
And in what way have I not?

32:47.066 --> 32:48.400
That speech
you gave yesterday,

32:48.434 --> 32:51.037
that was designed to stop
this farm bill.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.171
Yes, it was.

32:52.204 --> 32:53.472
And why wouldn't I stop it?

32:53.505 --> 32:54.606
Because we
don't want these

32:54.640 --> 32:56.075
invading parasites to know

32:56.108 --> 32:57.543
that we're on to them.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.711
Huh.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.047
Director,

33:01.080 --> 33:03.149
I'm a duly elected

33:03.182 --> 33:05.051
member of
the United States Senate.

33:05.084 --> 33:09.288
Now, with all due respect, sir,
no one has ever voted for you.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.023
So, don't you
dare tell me

33:11.057 --> 33:12.224
how to serve my constituents.

33:12.258 --> 33:13.625
I gave a speech because I think

33:13.659 --> 33:14.793
this farm bill is a boondoggle.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.495
I continue
to think it is

33:16.528 --> 33:17.496
and I don't care what

33:17.529 --> 33:19.365
secret plans you have.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.267
They have to work around me.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.568
Do you understand?

33:22.601 --> 33:26.572
I understand that
we're at cross-purposes.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.807
You're leaking, sir.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.576
I haven't said a thing
to anyone.

33:30.609 --> 33:31.810
That's not how I work.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.112
No, you're...

33:33.145 --> 33:34.313
leaking.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.448
I have to go.

33:36.482 --> 33:37.516
Yes.

33:37.549 --> 33:38.717
You should.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.286
I have a vote I need to get to.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.688
I guess you're not interested

33:42.721 --> 33:44.423
in the directorate, after all.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.792
Well, that depends.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.160
Who will I be serving?

33:55.467 --> 33:56.535
What am I doing?

33:56.568 --> 33:58.304
You want the bill
to pass as is.

33:58.337 --> 34:01.307
Right, right, good.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.809
What... what happened
to your arm?

34:03.842 --> 34:05.211
Oh, this?

34:05.244 --> 34:06.212
A mugging last night.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.379
Don't worry, I'm okay.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.814
DIANE:
Okay, all those in favor

34:08.847 --> 34:10.449
of separating out
the farm bill?

34:12.884 --> 34:14.486
I count...

34:14.520 --> 34:16.255
seven for,

34:16.288 --> 34:17.389
eight against.

34:17.423 --> 34:21.227
Senator Healy,
your motion is denied.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.695
The budget will be voted for,

34:23.729 --> 34:25.197
in total, by the committee.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.499
There will be no bifurcation.

34:27.533 --> 34:28.634
God help us.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.670
Is there any new business?

34:33.272 --> 34:35.574
Yes, there is, Madam Chair.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.509
DIANE: Yes?

34:37.543 --> 34:40.446
Senator?

34:54.793 --> 34:55.861
DIANE:
Senator Healy?

34:55.894 --> 34:57.363
Do you have something

34:57.396 --> 34:58.730
you want to say?

34:58.764 --> 35:00.666
Yes, ma'am.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.468
I'm protesting.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.702
I'm not leaving here

35:03.735 --> 35:05.804
until we table the farm bill.

35:05.837 --> 35:06.872
This won't stand.

35:06.905 --> 35:07.906
This can't stand.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.475
It's over.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.577
You lost fair
and square, Luke.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.844
You can't just
sit there.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.380
Make me move.
You're all making

35:14.413 --> 35:15.647
fools of yourselves.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.883
This is grandstanding,

35:17.916 --> 35:19.318
Madam Chair.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.620
We've had our vote.

35:21.653 --> 35:25.724
This is what comes
from weakness.

35:25.757 --> 35:28.827
LUKE:
We will not be moved.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.630
We will not

35:31.663 --> 35:32.798
be moved!

35:32.831 --> 35:34.833
(applause)

35:37.703 --> 35:39.705
(groaning)

35:54.520 --> 35:55.821
(groans)

36:06.798 --> 36:08.600
ELLA:
Snorting seaweed
isn't going

36:08.634 --> 36:10.369
to make you
feel better.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.437
How do you know?

36:11.470 --> 36:12.671
I feel better already.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.640
You're sick.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.808
(grunting):
You came after
my chief of staff?

36:16.842 --> 36:18.344
Why wouldn't I?

36:18.377 --> 36:19.811
He was helping you.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.714
I think this is for
the best, don't you?

36:22.748 --> 36:24.316
Ending it.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.617
You're letting them win.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.653
(breathing heavily)

36:30.021 --> 36:31.457
(dial tone cuts off)

36:31.490 --> 36:33.759
I don't like guns,

36:33.792 --> 36:34.993
but Scarlett got this for me.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.228
Her brother's in the military.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.298
Violence begets violence.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.632
Tell her to come out.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.868
Tell who?

36:42.901 --> 36:44.570
Whom.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.272
Force the queen to come out.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.474
What queen?

36:48.507 --> 36:49.641
Don't you play with me.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.910
Shoot me then.
Do it.

36:51.943 --> 36:52.778
(gun clicks)

36:52.811 --> 36:54.413
(gasps)

36:54.446 --> 36:56.382
(groans)

36:56.415 --> 36:58.784
(both grunting)

37:00.786 --> 37:02.020
You know the problem

37:02.053 --> 37:04.022
with liberals?

37:04.055 --> 37:06.958
They don't know
where the safety is.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.026
We need to work together.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.262
(gunshot)

37:18.036 --> 37:19.671
Go for it.

37:31.917 --> 37:36.988
We will not move from this spot
until we are heard.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.890
This farm bill serves no one
but the senate.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.592
We want to be heard.

37:40.626 --> 37:41.960
We want
to be heard!

37:41.993 --> 37:43.595
SENATORS (chanting):
We want to be heard!

37:43.629 --> 37:45.431
We want
to be heard!

37:45.464 --> 37:48.367
We want to be heard!
We want to be heard!

37:48.400 --> 37:49.901
We want to be heard!

37:49.935 --> 37:51.437
We want
to be heard!

37:51.470 --> 37:53.872
We want to be heard!
We want to be heard!

37:53.905 --> 37:55.374
We want
to be heard!

37:55.407 --> 37:57.909
This is not the way to be heard,
Senators.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.512
This senate
will not devolve

38:00.546 --> 38:03.982
into chaos and childhood antics.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.385
It's not what
our forefathers intended.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.386
Then we need
to separate the vote.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.454
Let us vote on the farm bill.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.455
No, sir.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.989
This is how it works.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.791
Get the requisite number
of votes

38:12.824 --> 38:14.092
to press your issues
in committee...

38:14.125 --> 38:15.327
Why won't you let

38:15.361 --> 38:17.095
democracy run its course?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.797
This is democracy, sir.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.932
You are losing
based on the number

38:20.966 --> 38:22.534
of votes you have.

38:22.568 --> 38:25.804
I have won based on the number
of votes I have.

38:25.837 --> 38:29.074
What you are doing now
is-is trying to circumvent

38:29.107 --> 38:31.543
democracy by grandstanding...
No, no.

38:31.577 --> 38:34.413
We are staying here until you
return so that we can vote.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.414
Okay.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.082
Here's what I say we do.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.951
Let's move
to a closed door session.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.820
Oh, well, that won't
stop this sit-in.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.455
I don't need
to stop the sit-in.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.991
Do you need to stop a tree
falling in the forest

38:46.024 --> 38:46.992
if there's no one there?

38:47.025 --> 38:48.093
Oh, people know we're here.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.094
Yeah, well,

38:49.127 --> 38:50.095
I'm the majority chair.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.563
We will not

38:51.597 --> 38:52.964
be denied.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.467
We will not be denied!
We will not be denied!

38:55.501 --> 38:56.868
* We shall not be moved

38:56.902 --> 38:58.704
* We will stand
and fight together... *

38:58.737 --> 39:01.139
LUKE:
Closed door session
or open door session,

39:01.172 --> 39:02.741
you spoke of a tree
in the woods,

39:02.774 --> 39:03.975
Senator Wheatus.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.577
Well, there are a whole bunch
of trees

39:05.611 --> 39:06.845
sitting here with me today,

39:06.878 --> 39:09.047
and our roots go deep,

39:09.080 --> 39:12.584
they are strong,
and they will not be moved!

39:12.618 --> 39:15.086
What are you afraid of, Senator?

39:15.120 --> 39:17.423
RED:
No, sir, I am not afraid of you.

39:17.456 --> 39:18.724
LUKE:
Then let us vote.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.158
We want to vote.

39:20.191 --> 39:24.162
* Just like a tree
that's standing by the water *

39:24.195 --> 39:27.799
* We shall not be moved

39:27.833 --> 39:30.402
* We will stand
and fight together *

39:30.436 --> 39:33.672
* We shall not be moved...

39:33.705 --> 39:35.541
Our founding fathers

39:35.574 --> 39:37.943
would be proud.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.546
Now, this moment...

39:40.579 --> 39:42.848
is the beginning of true
participatory democracy.

39:42.881 --> 39:46.084
I will stand here
until hell freezes over.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.519
I will stan...

39:47.553 --> 39:48.920
(televisions beeping)

39:48.954 --> 39:50.922
(people groaning)

40:00.699 --> 40:03.001
* Not be moved

40:03.034 --> 40:05.036
* We will stand
and fight together... *

40:05.070 --> 40:06.672
LUKE:
What are you
afraid of, Senator?

40:06.705 --> 40:08.139
The public wants to see
what we're doing.

40:08.173 --> 40:10.041
* We will stand
and fight together... *

40:10.075 --> 40:12.210
Good luck with that.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.814
But go ahead, keep sitting in.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.849
(scoffing):
Let's see how well that works.

40:17.883 --> 40:21.086
* We shall not be moved.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.187
(phone buzzes)

40:31.597 --> 40:33.599
(chuckles)

40:35.867 --> 40:36.968
You recovered?

40:37.002 --> 40:39.938
Yeah, I got better,
a lot better.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.240
Tell your girlfriend
to come at me.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.810
My girlfriend's
headed out of town.

40:44.843 --> 40:46.978
No, no, she won't leave you.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.213
Why do you say that?

40:48.246 --> 40:50.081
Because I'm not an idiot.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.550
(chuckles)

40:51.583 --> 40:54.085
Oh, you are sweet, Gareth.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.756
That's one of the things

40:57.789 --> 40:59.925
I like about you.

40:59.958 --> 41:03.228
Oh, uh, thank you
for nurturing me

41:03.261 --> 41:04.830
in my time of need.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.231
LAUREL: Luke.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.867
* We will stand and fight
together... *

41:08.900 --> 41:10.235
I thought you
were heading out.

41:10.268 --> 41:13.071
I was, then I saw you
going all Berkeley here.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.606
Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.575
I realized I had to see
the end of this.

41:16.608 --> 41:17.576
Yeah, well, the end is in sight.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.277
We don't have video.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.279
Yes, you do.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.749
* We shall not be moved

41:26.117 --> 41:28.820
* We shall not,
we shall not be moved *

41:28.854 --> 41:29.855
What is that?

41:29.888 --> 41:31.857
What the hell
is that?!

41:31.890 --> 41:33.992
All we ask is that
our respected colleagues

41:34.025 --> 41:36.127
come back and allow us to vote.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.863
That's it.
Democracy.

41:37.896 --> 41:38.864
Gareth!

41:38.897 --> 41:40.198
Are you watching this?

41:41.667 --> 41:44.002
Yeah, it's Periscope.

41:44.035 --> 41:45.136
What is that?

41:45.170 --> 41:47.573
It's a live-streaming app.

41:47.606 --> 41:50.008
How do you turn it off?

41:50.041 --> 41:51.610
You don't, Senator.

41:52.644 --> 41:53.712
What the hell

41:53.745 --> 41:55.046
do you mean, you don't?

41:55.080 --> 41:57.616
* Stands by the water

41:57.649 --> 41:59.150
* We shall not be moved...

41:59.184 --> 42:01.787
So, when do you leave?

42:01.820 --> 42:05.924
* We shall not,
we shall not be moved... *

42:06.958 --> 42:08.159
I don't know.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.928
When the job is done, I guess.

42:10.962 --> 42:13.031
You seem oddly happy.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.065
I know.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.734
If the world is gonna end,

42:15.767 --> 42:17.268
I want to be here.

42:17.302 --> 42:18.570
I want to be part of it.

42:20.038 --> 42:24.275
* We shall not be moved...

42:24.309 --> 42:26.912
Okay, so, what do
we have to do?

42:26.945 --> 42:28.880
* We shall not be moved...

42:28.914 --> 42:29.981
I'll be back.

42:30.015 --> 42:31.216
* We shall not

42:31.249 --> 42:32.718
* We shall not be moved

42:32.751 --> 42:34.886
* Just like
a tree that's stand... *

42:34.920 --> 42:37.322
Don't do that.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.790
Laurel?

42:38.824 --> 42:39.791
What's up?

42:39.825 --> 42:41.660
Yeah, what's up, Laurel?

42:41.693 --> 42:43.028
Why aren't you
on your plane to...

42:43.061 --> 42:44.262
(sighs)

42:44.295 --> 42:46.231
...something mean
I'll think up later.

42:47.265 --> 42:48.934
I'm staying.

42:50.969 --> 42:54.205
What, what, are we supposed
to, like, thank you?

42:54.239 --> 42:55.273
No, you're supposed
to work with me.

42:55.306 --> 42:56.307
On what?

42:57.843 --> 43:00.145
I know what their plan is...

43:00.178 --> 43:01.913
and I think I know
how to stop it.
