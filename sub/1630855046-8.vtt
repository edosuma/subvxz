WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.426
<i>...in the depths of winter
cannot end on this autumn night.</i>

00:10.468 --> 00:13.513
<i>This victory alone
is not the change we seek.</i>

00:13.513 --> 00:16.516
<i>It is only the chance
for us to make that change.</i>

00:16.516 --> 00:20.311
<i>And that cannot happen
if we go back to the way things were.</i>

00:20.311 --> 00:22.480
<i>It can't happen without you...</i>

00:22.480 --> 00:23.606
Come closer.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.359
I didn't think you were serious
about the blanket.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.862
Yeah. You can't see my face.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.363
Deal or no deal?

00:30.363 --> 00:33.742
Deal, of course.
But I feel like we know each other now.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.996
Hey, man, we met on Yahoo Chess.
Like, you don't know me.

00:39.372 --> 00:43.001
We played a lot of games, though.
Tell me your name, at least.

00:43.001 --> 00:46.337
You agreed not to talk.
- Okay, okay. Sorry.

00:47.464 --> 00:51.134
Why don't you just hook up
with guys at bars and stuff?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.553
Look, are we doing this or not?

00:54.053 --> 00:56.598
- Do you have a condom?
Uh, yeah.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.018
One second.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.025
So is this like your thing?

01:07.025 --> 01:09.778
- Strangers? Older men?

01:09.778 --> 01:12.864
Well, they say explore in your 20s, right?

01:13.698 --> 01:16.326
- Make sure to spit on it first, okay?
- Yeah.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.870
<i>...individual liberty and national unity.</i>

01:18.870 --> 01:21.623
<i>- Those are values that we all share,</i>

01:21.623 --> 01:24.876
<i>and while the Democratic Party
has won a great victory tonight,</i>

01:24.876 --> 01:29.339
<i>we do so with a measure of humility
and determination to heal the divides...</i>

01:38.723 --> 01:42.977
<i>There will be setbacks and false starts...</i>

02:04.833 --> 02:07.585
He needs some time to cool down.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.505
He did have an emotional affair with Mia,
so it's--

02:10.505 --> 02:12.549
Just stop. You fucked it all up.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.470
I could tell George
that his own mother kept this from him.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.347
There she is. The real Amy.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.224
I wanna see my daughter.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.726
I don't like how he's handled this either.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.437
I can try to get him
to check out of the hotel.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.564
Oh, thanks.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.942
But you'll say you never
had physical relations with that boy.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.237
Uh, your boy is never gonna believe that.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.989
Joji only saw texts.

02:36.614 --> 02:37.991
I can bring him around.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.454
Fumi, why are you helping me?

02:43.454 --> 02:44.998
I'm a helpful person.

02:46.624 --> 02:50.211
You know, if we get divorced,

02:50.211 --> 02:52.714
he's gonna get half of everything.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.675
You're not gonna need me
for these shopping sprees anymore.

02:55.675 --> 03:00.305
I've heard you say my son is the anchor
you've been missing your whole life,

03:00.305 --> 03:01.639
and that may be true.

03:02.181 --> 03:06.519
But without you, he'd be sitting
at the bottom of the ocean,

03:06.519 --> 03:08.187
dull and gray.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.607
He's no artist.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.946
No way. That did not happen.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.657
What did you say?
Did Mr. Mackey believe you?

03:19.657 --> 03:22.744
<i>Yeah. But, Amy, I can't say
you're in the bathroom for every class.</i>

03:22.744 --> 03:25.496
- Sure, you can.
<i>- You're not coming to school?</i>

03:25.496 --> 03:29.375
It's the one time my mom's out of town.
I covered for you before.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.252
<i>What are you gonna do all day?</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:34.797
Buy clothes for UCSB.
God, I can't wait to get out of here.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.425
<i>Just go to Chico State with me,
and we can live together.</i>

03:38.426 --> 03:40.094
If I had parents like yours.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.805
I gotta get as far away
from here as I can.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.435
- Shit.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.853
What is he doing home?

03:50.813 --> 03:54.609
I told them I had a lunch meeting.
They didn't even ask who with.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.568
The idiots.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.863
- I could do such a better job.
Yeah, you would.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.157
They're not the smartest bosses.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.868
I'm just glad you finally had some time.

04:03.868 --> 04:07.830
Yeah, me too. One of these days,
I'll take you to a really nice restaurant.

04:07.830 --> 04:08.748
Dad?

04:09.666 --> 04:12.085
Okay.
- I love this one place downtown...

04:34.274 --> 04:35.275
Oh.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.110
- Amy.
- Hi, Mom.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.486
Oh, my gosh.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.571
- You drove so far.
- Yeah.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.782
- Um, is Dad home?
- Oh, yeah.

04:42.782 --> 04:43.950
He's in his room.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.451
I'll get him.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.369
Come in.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.541
Where's George and June?

04:51.541 --> 04:53.710
Uh, they're home.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.753
I felt like driving up by myself.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.213
Yeah.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.133
Is everything okay?

05:01.009 --> 05:03.386
- Everything's fine.
When's the last time we saw you?

05:03.386 --> 05:05.638
- Two years ago?
- Wait a minute.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.433
Are you guys making out
in front of the Louvre?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.476
It's been a fun couple of years.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.731
- Since when do you travel?
We went all over Europe together.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.983
If you had stayed in touch,
you'd know all this.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.278
Oh, my gosh, come on, you guys.
Come, let's eat, Amy.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.196
Yeah, okay.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.284
Ah...

05:28.077 --> 05:30.913
So you bought a vacation house, huh?

05:30.913 --> 05:33.291
Yeah, I did. It's really nice.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.128
Next time, buy one for me
and your mom, okay?

05:37.962 --> 05:40.381
Well, I paid off your mortgage, remember?

05:40.381 --> 05:44.385
Our friends' son moved them
into his house to be closer.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.179
Yeah, Dad, you'd hate that.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.265
He's just saying,
that's what other parents told us.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.184
We can't even see our own granddaughter.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.979
Well, considering how I turned out,
why would I want you guys around Junie?

05:55.730 --> 05:57.815
You act like we're so evil.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.484
What did we ever do, huh?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.986
We provided. We sacrificed.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.280
We moved here just for you.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.491
What do we get in return?

06:09.368 --> 06:10.953
You didn't even wanna have me.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.250
- Do you want more, Bruce?
- I should go to bed.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.340
We're proud for all of your success, okay?

06:22.924 --> 06:24.342
It was nice to see you.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.345
- Good night.
- Night, Dad.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.683
It's really good, Mom.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.018
- Eat more.
- Okay.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.981
I have no idea how
you've put up with him all these years.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.775
Your father, he's a good man.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.944
You focus on the negative.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.491
Mom, I drove all the way up here
to tell you something.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.742
- Hmm?
- Um...

06:51.828 --> 06:54.622
I don't mean to upset you,
but I saw something my senior year,

06:54.622 --> 06:57.333
- and I should have told you--
- Oh, my God. Just stop. Okay?

06:57.333 --> 07:00.711
You're not gonna tell me
anything I don't already know. Okay?

07:00.711 --> 07:03.339
What do you mean?
You and Dad already talked about it?

07:03.339 --> 07:05.633
No. We don't have to.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.802
And you and I don't have to either.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.264
See, this is the problem with our family.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.307
We never talked about anything openly.

07:13.307 --> 07:16.102
- And now--
- Amy, that's enough.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.896
- That's enough. Just stop, please?
- Okay, okay.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.315
I wish you'd talked to me, growing up.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.403
Why are you bringing this up now, huh?

07:25.403 --> 07:27.822
Are you and George having problem?

07:28.948 --> 07:30.616
This is about you and Dad.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.827
What's going on? Tell me.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.125
More and more when I look in the mirror,

07:40.585 --> 07:42.128
I see you and Dad...

07:45.214 --> 07:46.299
and I hate it.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.385
I know that sounds ungrateful,

07:49.385 --> 07:52.972
okay, and I don't know,
maybe you felt the same way

07:52.972 --> 07:54.765
about your parents too at some point.

07:55.266 --> 08:00.021
You know, just generations
of bad decisions sitting inside you.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.981
You'll realize this as you get older,

08:01.981 --> 08:05.067
but if you look back all the time,
you crash.

08:06.527 --> 08:09.572
Whatever's going on, put it behind you.

08:10.406 --> 08:11.824
George is good for you.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.618
For June too. Hmm?

08:19.415 --> 08:21.167
What are you even talking about?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.753
What is this charge?
I don't remember.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.214
Oh. You think I'm stupid?

08:26.714 --> 08:28.883
Let me see that.
Okay. Right here.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.009
Fifty dollars!

08:30.009 --> 08:32.386
That was for dinner
that you and I ate together!

08:32.386 --> 08:34.805
Oh, okay. Then what is this?

08:34.805 --> 08:36.974
Do you see this? And this?

08:36.974 --> 08:40.394
Do you know what those come from?
They're from me making money!

08:40.394 --> 08:42.813
Money for Amy! I didn't ask for this.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.898
Neither did I!

08:43.898 --> 08:47.151
But I told you,
having a child is expensive!

08:47.151 --> 08:50.279
What are you talking about?
We didn't have a choice!

09:20.142 --> 09:21.894
Did you see that?

09:22.436 --> 09:25.856
Amy, I'm always watching.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.317
Don't tell Mom and Dad, please.

09:28.317 --> 09:31.320
Oh, I would never tell your parents.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.948
I can't tell anyone your secrets.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.658
How come?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.705
Because no one would love you.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.421
Yay, we're home!

09:50.339 --> 09:52.133
- Hey.
Mommy!

09:52.133 --> 09:54.051
Junie, hey.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.513
I missed you so much.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.808
- Did you have fun at the hotel?
- Yep.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.644
The hotel had two pools.

10:03.644 --> 10:07.565
- Inside and outside.
Wow, wowie.

10:09.442 --> 10:13.362
Hey, Mama and Dada gotta have a talk.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.406
Why don't you and Fumi
take Luca for a walk?

10:15.406 --> 10:16.324
Okay.

10:18.784 --> 10:19.619
Okay.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.330
Come on, <i>oba-chan,</i> let's go.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.498
You two just--

10:25.041 --> 10:26.584
Just take your time.

10:34.008 --> 10:37.345
- She sure loves her pools, huh?
Yeah.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.639
She's just like you.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.018
My mom said that I should hear you out.

10:44.935 --> 10:48.272
She said that you were
just messing with that kid online.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.528
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

10:55.571 --> 10:59.283
I want to clear the air
and put this all behind us.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.793
George...

11:11.879 --> 11:13.130
I slept with him.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.179
I don't wanna hide things anymore.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.810
So I didn't have to sell the Tamago?

11:25.810 --> 11:28.437
No. But I'm gonna get it back.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.606
I will, I'm gonna talk to Jordan.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.401
I'm gonna come clean to Naomi
and the neighbor.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.611
I wanna make everything right.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.196
So you cheated on me

11:38.030 --> 11:40.199
because of your road rage?

11:41.033 --> 11:42.660
I mean, I guess when you...

11:43.953 --> 11:45.579
hear it all at once, yeah.

11:46.414 --> 11:51.085
You know, I actually felt better yesterday
when it was just the affair.

11:52.670 --> 11:56.799
I was mad,
but I thought we could talk it out.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.968
And, George, we--

12:00.219 --> 12:01.053
We--

12:02.430 --> 12:03.848
We can talk it out.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.687
It didn't feel this messy at the time.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.689
You let me be friends with him.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.401
You let me invite him to our home.

12:15.401 --> 12:19.238
This... deranged Korean handyman.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.824
He didn't seem that dangerous at the time.

12:21.824 --> 12:25.911
- I don't know how to explain it, but--
- My mom was hospitalized, Amy.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.497
And you still doubled down.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.501
You put June in danger.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.172
I--

12:37.840 --> 12:41.218
I don't understand
how you could hate this guy so much.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.762
- Are you obsessed with him?
- I don't know.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.184
I don't think it's him. It--

12:54.315 --> 12:57.318
You had so many opportunities to tell me.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.196
I know.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.034
I've been like this my entire life.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.705
I want to blame my parents...

13:12.708 --> 13:14.210
but I think it's just me.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.088
I feel like I married a stranger.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.634
George, I'm a bad person.

13:25.679 --> 13:30.142
I've tried to hide that from you,
because... you're not.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.105
You're as good as it gets.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.151
That's why I fell in love with you.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.666
I want a divorce.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.056
You can have the house.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.685
You can have everything.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.567
But please don't take Junie away from me.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.781
The lawyers will figure it out.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.892
Oh.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.519
Choo, choo, choo...

14:57.938 --> 14:59.732
She love the water.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.443
Good job, Amy.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.904
- Daddy's got you.
- Aw.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.823
We love you so much.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.587
Wow, our son does everything well.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.132
He's got a big pee-pee too.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.093
- Don't say things like that.
- Why not?

15:28.636 --> 15:29.637
Ah.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.807
Seriously, our Sung-Hyun seems blessed.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.062
We did good.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.569
Now, your insurance may
or may not cover the damages.

15:45.569 --> 15:49.073
Check with your policy provider.
I recommend you do that right away.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.451
I don't understand how this could happen.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.827
It's hard to say right now.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.830
But as we understand it,
nobody was home at the time of the fire,

15:56.830 --> 16:01.001
so if it was something like, say, arson,
most insurance policies won't cover that.

16:01.585 --> 16:05.422
Again, don't hesitate to ask
your insurance provider questions.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.757
Did you say arson?

16:06.757 --> 16:08.759
Now, I'm just citing that as an example.

16:08.759 --> 16:11.053
A lot of folks get blindsided
by their insurance,

16:11.053 --> 16:13.597
then unfairly blindside me
with their frustrations.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.975
I'll call you if I find anything.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.443
Fuck. I'm so fucking stupid, man.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.569
Yo, calm down.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.072
No, Amy-- Fucking Amy did this, bro.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.910
Why would you think that?
I didn't do anything to provoke her.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.328
No, it's my fault.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.998
What are you talking about?

16:39.957 --> 16:42.292
I was pissed off
about the whole road rage thing,

16:42.292 --> 16:43.752
so I fucking went to her place

16:43.752 --> 16:46.005
and I called her out
in front of her husband.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.633
Paul, why would you do that?

16:49.633 --> 16:51.552
You told me to not take shit.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.221
I have never said that!
When the fuck did I ever say that?

16:54.221 --> 16:56.306
I told you to tell me everything.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.018
How does she know about this house?

16:59.768 --> 17:01.895
I told her about it before we broke up.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.231
Oh, my God. Dude, what the...?

17:04.231 --> 17:07.026
- God, we were so close.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.945
God, I fucking hate her.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.071
Dude,

17:12.698 --> 17:14.491
if she really did this, man...

17:16.326 --> 17:17.244
it's over.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.372
It's over. There's no holding back.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.416
I'm going all out.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.047
<i>This is Amy Lau. Please leave a message.</i>

17:44.271 --> 17:47.816
Hey. I heard Holly thinks you're cool.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.278
- Cool?
- Yeah. That's a good thing.

17:51.862 --> 17:52.780
Say hi.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.825
You don't have to sit by yourself.

17:56.825 --> 17:57.868
Okay.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.761
Don't worry. Okay?

18:15.761 --> 18:18.555
It'll be okay.
I'm gonna call the insurance.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.058
They'll cover everything,
and we'll rebuild the house.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.812
How? We shouldn't have thought
everything would work out.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.605
Mom, don't say things like that.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.690
It's just a hiccup.
I'll figure it out.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.609
We should change our flight.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.195
Let's hurry back to Korea. I need to work.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.322
<i>Appa,</i> just stay.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.573
It's fine.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.868
Sung-Hyun, we're tired from jet lag.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.079
Let's go to your apartment.

18:45.040 --> 18:45.916
Okay.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.514
- What's up?
<i>Amy cheated on me.</i>

19:43.348 --> 19:46.185
What? No. Amy?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.854
<i>Yeah. With this beautiful younger man.</i>

19:48.854 --> 19:50.731
<i>He showed up to our house this morning.</i>

19:50.731 --> 19:53.901
<i>I had to take June to a hotel.
I haven't even talked to Amy about it.</i>

19:53.901 --> 19:58.906
Well, you gotta divorce her, right?
Take her for all she's worth?

19:58.906 --> 20:01.909
<i>What? That didn't even cross my mind.</i>

20:01.909 --> 20:03.827
<i>I can't imagine my life without her.</i>

20:05.662 --> 20:07.706
<i>Hello? Zane?</i>

20:14.171 --> 20:15.172
Veronica?

20:28.227 --> 20:31.772
- Fucker! Did you burn down my house?
- I don't know what you're talking about!

20:31.772 --> 20:34.066
I saw you!
Did you burn down my parents' house?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.652
- I was just passing through. Relax.
- Why were you there?

20:36.652 --> 20:38.320
- Huh?
- I was just curious, okay?

20:38.320 --> 20:40.572
I was passing through,
I swear on the Bible--

20:40.572 --> 20:42.616
Fuck you, you fucking liar!

20:42.616 --> 20:45.452
I've been charging
magazine subscriptions to your name.

20:45.452 --> 20:49.373
- I was just messing around. That's it.
- Don't you fucking lie to me, dude!

20:49.373 --> 20:51.375
All right, all right, all right!

20:51.375 --> 20:53.293
I was just messing around.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.545
Little pranks, that's it.

20:55.545 --> 20:56.922
I was just jealous.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.758
Jealous? Now I know you're fucking lying.

20:59.758 --> 21:04.221
Veronica always speaks
so highly of you, all right?

21:05.514 --> 21:07.224
She's never gotten over you.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.315
Well, you got her. You won.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.820
I overheard her saying that...

21:21.280 --> 21:23.490
you're the best she's ever had, so...

21:24.533 --> 21:26.994
Yeah, I was jealous, okay?

21:26.994 --> 21:28.620
But like a normal jealous,

21:28.620 --> 21:32.249
not like "burn down your house" jealous.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.543
I-- I swear.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.547
Why--?

21:40.090 --> 21:43.760
Why did you--? That--
What you did was not nice!

21:44.886 --> 21:46.638
It's not nice to do that!

21:46.638 --> 21:47.806
I know. I'm sorry.

21:53.228 --> 21:55.147
She won't even let me touch her.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.828
Okay, okay.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.248
There, there. It's okay.

22:16.209 --> 22:17.210
It's hard.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.007
It's not easy.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.511
<i>Mail comes in all shapes...</i>

22:26.511 --> 22:29.556
What if Danny
gets bullied again at a new school?

22:29.556 --> 22:33.101
He'll be fine.
He's so much happier with Paul around.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.145
I'm worried about the motel.

22:35.145 --> 22:38.065
What if Hurricane Harbor
steals our business?

22:38.065 --> 22:41.318
It'll be fine. We're so busy lately.

22:42.778 --> 22:46.031
What if you tell school I'm
sick, and I can help with Paul tomorrow?

22:46.031 --> 22:48.408
Danny, you have to go to school.

22:48.408 --> 22:51.203
Mom, it's one day.
Paul likes having me around.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.039
No, Danny. Go get your bath.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.124
Right now!

22:56.124 --> 22:57.292
Let's go, Paul.

22:58.627 --> 23:01.838
Paul, if you study really hard
and skip three grades,

23:01.838 --> 23:04.007
then we can go to school at the same time.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.593
That's the plan.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.262
I think it's a good plan.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.892
Yes?
<i>It took a couple days,</i>

23:13.892 --> 23:16.436
<i>but we're certain now
that this is what caused the fire.</i>

23:16.436 --> 23:18.605
<i>- We can send you the reports.</i>
- Okay.

23:18.605 --> 23:21.775
I thought-- No, no,
I thought you said it was arson.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.861
<i>Again, I was just giving you an example.</i>

23:24.861 --> 23:26.404
<i>We found faulty wiring.</i>

23:26.404 --> 23:30.909
<i>There's a 30-amp breaker in the house,
but there's 14-gauge wiring all over.</i>

23:31.409 --> 23:33.370
<i>An absolute moron installed this.</i>

23:33.370 --> 23:36.123
Okay, but maybe you should
keep investigating,

23:36.123 --> 23:38.667
because that was really quick, you know.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.503
<i>Trust me,
we did a very thorough investigation.</i>

23:41.503 --> 23:44.422
<i>Buddy, you should be glad it isn't arson.</i>

23:44.422 --> 23:46.925
<i>Now the construction company
is on the hook for this.</i>

23:47.592 --> 23:50.387
Yeah. No, I am. I'm glad.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.099
<i>If anything turns up that says otherwise,
I'll let you know.</i>

23:54.099 --> 23:56.685
<i>In the meantime,
get in touch with your claims adjuster,</i>

23:56.685 --> 23:58.770
<i>- and they'll get you sorted out. Okay?</i>
- Okay.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.981
<i>- Alrighty, take care.</i>
- Okay.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.295
Yo, you see Mom and Dad's text?

24:23.295 --> 24:24.713
They just boarded the plane.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.382
And Esther's been trying to reach you.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.260
You good?

24:35.682 --> 24:36.850
It was arson, man.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.063
Is that official?

24:43.940 --> 24:45.525
Yeah, I spoke to the investigator.

24:45.525 --> 24:49.821
He said he found a gasoline canister
and a glove nearby the house.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.157
Fuck.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.160
It was a woman's glove.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.078
It's Amy.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.294
- We're going to her place, fuck shit up.
- No, no, no, we're not.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.755
We'll just let the authorities
do their thing, man.

25:06.755 --> 25:07.797
Yo, the authorities?

25:07.797 --> 25:10.300
- They'll search her house.
- Are you fucking serious?

25:10.300 --> 25:12.677
She's got lawyers.
Nothing's gonna happen to her.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.304
She'll have to pay for damages.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.639
Or maybe jail time.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.225
But if we retaliate, we get in trouble.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.809
I'm looking out for us, man.

25:19.809 --> 25:22.520
- Can't be impulsive with this shit.
- Fuck!

25:23.813 --> 25:26.316
Yo, we were doing so well, man.
We fucking had it.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.318
- Yeah, I know.
- I ruined it all.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.527
What are you--? No.

25:29.527 --> 25:34.241
- I should've burned in the fucking house.
- What are you talking about? Yo, hey.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.575
Listen, you're great.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.827
All right? You're doing great.

25:39.454 --> 25:42.707
- Then why do I keep fucking everything up?
- You're not fucking up.

25:42.707 --> 25:43.833
Hey.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.544
We didn't fuck anything up, man, okay?

25:46.544 --> 25:47.587
We didn't.

25:50.548 --> 25:51.841
I appreciate you.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.594
I appreciate you too, man.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.352
Yo, I gotta mail a bunch of shit
to colleges for my applications.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.353
You got stamps?

26:03.353 --> 26:05.397
Think there's some in the office.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.316
So I talked to Veronica about UC Irvine.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.567
Hope that's cool.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.319
I don't care.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.573
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

26:16.616 --> 26:19.661
Yo, I hope I get in.
She said the business program's tight.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.578
Nice.

26:21.246 --> 26:24.124
Yo, I got my incorporation papers
all sorted out.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.126
At Cho Service Construction.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.335
Pretty good, right?

26:28.461 --> 26:29.671
It's kind of corny.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.172
No, it's good.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.132
It's catchy.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.427
So you really moving?

26:35.427 --> 26:36.344
Yeah.

26:36.344 --> 26:39.180
Yeah, I'm gonna post up in Beverly Hills.
Word of mouth.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.849
Bam, million dollar construction.

26:40.849 --> 26:45.854
Yo, maybe you stay with me
and commute to college.

26:46.688 --> 26:50.191
I'm good, man, I don't even know
where I'm gonna end up so--

26:50.191 --> 26:52.736
- Maybe go someplace close by.
- Dude, stop.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.279
I'm doing my own thing.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.869
Hey, can you get me
some light bulbs from downstairs?

27:00.869 --> 27:01.995
You go get it.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.964
<i>Here at Forsters,
we're proud to carry Kōyōhaus plants</i>

27:54.964 --> 27:56.674
<i>in all of our stores.</i>

27:56.674 --> 27:59.010
<i>Check out the new Kōyōhaus display</i>

27:59.010 --> 28:02.514
<i>between Aisle 6 and 7
in the home gardening section.</i>

28:03.723 --> 28:05.934
<i>See a sales associate for assistance.</i>

28:06.935 --> 28:10.772
<i>And don't forget to sign up

28:10.772 --> 28:12.148
<i>Have a great day.</i>

28:14.692 --> 28:16.945
June, why did you hit Luca?

28:17.570 --> 28:19.697
That's not okay. We don't do that.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.950
Where did Mommy go?

28:22.575 --> 28:26.204
Um, she had to leave, sweetie.

28:27.414 --> 28:30.458
You said I could see her after the hotel.

28:30.458 --> 28:33.586
I know we just got back, but Mommy's busy.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.380
Like she was with the deal.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.882
So she might be gone for a while.

28:39.259 --> 28:42.011
But you have me, okay?

28:42.011 --> 28:43.263
I hate you.

28:45.098 --> 28:45.932
June.

28:52.355 --> 28:55.275
Sweetie, we need to go in the car
right now, okay?

28:55.275 --> 28:58.111
- I don't wanna.
- We're gonna go for a drive.

28:58.111 --> 29:00.196
- Come on, Junie, let's go.
- I don't wanna go!

29:00.196 --> 29:01.197
Yo, George.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.159
Right here, man. Hey.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.286
Zane.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.288
What are you doing here?

29:08.288 --> 29:11.040
I was just in the area.
Thought I'd say hey.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.626
Our convo got cut off quick the other day.

29:14.836 --> 29:15.795
All good, man.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.964
Yeah. Ooh. Look at that puppy.

29:17.964 --> 29:21.009
Oh, man, the things
we've done to wolves, huh?

29:22.552 --> 29:24.345
Hey, now's not the best time--

29:24.345 --> 29:26.556
Hey, I brought you a Kōyōhaus plant.

29:27.474 --> 29:31.186
I realize it's like bringing Linkin Park
a copy of <i>Hybrid Theory</i> or something.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.103
Yeah.

29:33.271 --> 29:36.483
Um, no worries.
We were just about to head out.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.610
All good. I'll meet you out front.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.865
Junie, I'm gonna put you in the car,

29:43.865 --> 29:47.160
but I need you to stay inside
with Luca, okay?

29:47.160 --> 29:49.871
Just stay in there until I come back.
Can you do that?

29:49.871 --> 29:52.665
- Can we ask Zane for more Skittles?
- Not right now, Junie.

29:52.665 --> 29:54.626
- George!

29:54.626 --> 29:55.877
I'm up front now!

30:00.548 --> 30:02.550
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

30:11.810 --> 30:12.936
Hey, man.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.938
How you holding up?

30:14.938 --> 30:16.481
I'm doing better.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.398
Honestly.

30:17.398 --> 30:20.276
I've had some time to process everything.

30:20.276 --> 30:24.531
June's not feeling too well right now,
so I should probably get going.

30:24.531 --> 30:28.326
Hey, do you mind
if I use your bathroom real quick?

30:28.910 --> 30:31.996
I drank too much Gatorade.
That purple one's so good.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.666
I'll be real quick, then I'm gone.

30:41.798 --> 30:42.757
Of course.

30:42.757 --> 30:43.925
Yeah? Cool.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.468
Thanks, man. Ooh.

31:13.496 --> 31:16.165
This toilet's crazy.
It's opening its mouth and shit--

31:17.041 --> 31:18.251
You're under arrest.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.921
George, man, what's going on?

31:21.921 --> 31:23.965
I know everything, Danny.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.551
The police are on their way,

31:26.551 --> 31:29.762
so just put your hands above your head
and stay put.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.264
On their way for what?

31:31.264 --> 31:33.308
For not telling you my real name?

31:33.308 --> 31:36.060
How about attempted robbery?
Assaulting my mother?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.645
I had nothing to do with that.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.063
Property damage?

31:39.063 --> 31:40.356
Road rage?

31:40.356 --> 31:43.192
The police don't care
about any of that shit.

31:43.192 --> 31:46.613
Dude, just put the gun down
and think this through--

31:59.042 --> 31:59.876
George?

32:00.376 --> 32:01.836
Hey. Hey. George!

32:03.004 --> 32:03.922
George!

32:06.049 --> 32:07.050

32:07.050 --> 32:07.967
