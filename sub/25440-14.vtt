00:40.479 --> 00:42.557
<i>Previously,
on</i> "Tangled"...

00:43.219 --> 00:45.530
<i> It's my first
trip outside of Corona.</i>

00:45.616 --> 00:49.503
<i>It's like a whole new chapter
of our lives has just begun.</i>

00:49.635 --> 00:52.839
<i>Aren't you excited to see where
these rocks are taking us?</i>

00:52.925 --> 00:54.753
<i>My name is Adira,</i>

00:54.897 --> 00:57.596
and I am here to make sure
you get to the end

00:57.682 --> 00:59.784
of this journey
you're embarking on.

00:59.870 --> 01:01.589
<i>The Dark Kingdom.</i>

01:02.252 --> 01:05.143
This stone has
destroyed too many lives.

01:05.229 --> 01:06.799
It stops today!

01:06.885 --> 01:08.721
Your Majesty, please.

01:08.864 --> 01:11.596
You know the stone
cannot be destroyed.

01:11.682 --> 01:15.464
Our only hope is to keep
its power from the world.

01:15.777 --> 01:21.250
Anyone who seeks
out this opal, must be stopped.

01:21.448 --> 01:25.925
<i> Eons ago,
an evil warlock, Zhan Tiri,</i>

01:26.050 --> 01:28.760
<i>had a deep hatred for Corona.</i>

01:28.958 --> 01:31.633
<i> I want answers
more than anyone.</i>

01:32.047 --> 01:35.602
<i>I feel like whatever is waiting
for us at the end of this road,</i>

01:35.788 --> 01:38.438
<i>is only part of
why we're out here.</i>

01:42.133 --> 01:44.342
<i> The stone
and its destructive power</i>

01:44.505 --> 01:47.288
<i>must be kept secret
from the world.</i>

01:49.733 --> 01:52.929
It is the Brotherhood's duty
to keep that secret,

01:53.015 --> 01:56.088
it is King Edmund's
dying wish.

01:56.173 --> 01:57.655
There is another way!

01:57.808 --> 01:59.791
If we could go out
and find the sun drop...

01:59.937 --> 02:01.304
Enough!

02:02.345 --> 02:05.257
The sun drop is a myth,
sister.

02:09.417 --> 02:10.991
It's real, Hector,

02:11.093 --> 02:13.998
and its power could neutralize
the moon stone!

02:14.123 --> 02:17.042
Go, go, chase empty legends
like a fool,

02:17.101 --> 02:19.694
but just know,
if you come back,

02:19.780 --> 02:21.538
you ain't my fellow brethren.

02:21.624 --> 02:22.843
You're a traitor.

02:22.929 --> 02:26.171
Sun drop or not,
I'll end you.

02:37.660 --> 02:40.483
Okay, bank left!
Duck!

02:40.751 --> 02:42.434
Yeah! We lost her!

02:42.519 --> 02:44.570
How many times
do I have to tell you?

02:44.655 --> 02:46.429
Watch your flank!

02:46.567 --> 02:48.270
Ah, ha, ha!
Nice move!

02:48.356 --> 02:50.286
Thanks!
It's just like old times.

02:50.372 --> 02:53.153
Well, not quite like
old times.

02:55.841 --> 02:57.181
Whoo-hoo!

02:59.488 --> 03:01.458
Whoa!

03:02.444 --> 03:05.536
I've gotten pretty good at
horseback riding since Corona.

03:05.622 --> 03:07.239
Great.
Don't get cocky.

03:07.364 --> 03:10.088
I still got a trick
or two up my sleeve.

03:14.226 --> 03:16.169
Told you we had this.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.442
Oh, whoa!

03:21.075 --> 03:22.106
Phew.

03:22.192 --> 03:24.388
- Thanks, girl.
- <i>Make way!</i>

03:24.531 --> 03:27.122
Don't worry, boy.
You got this.

03:27.364 --> 03:30.884
Raps! Wait!
It's too wide! You could...

03:37.341 --> 03:38.743
..go splat.

03:38.997 --> 03:40.122
Ha!

03:40.208 --> 03:42.489
Best race ever!

03:43.827 --> 03:45.904
After being cramped
in that caravan

03:45.990 --> 03:47.170
for the last few months,

03:47.271 --> 03:49.472
it's so great to be out here
in the open,

03:49.558 --> 03:51.331
<i>just</i> the two of us.

03:51.417 --> 03:53.005
Yeah, it's great.

03:53.090 --> 03:55.276
But for the record,
this was a scouting trip.

03:55.362 --> 03:57.979
No one officially said
anything about it being a race.

03:58.213 --> 04:01.424
Cass,
don't be a sore loser.

04:01.565 --> 04:03.573
Hey, I am not
a sore loser.

04:03.659 --> 04:04.964
To be a sore loser,

04:05.050 --> 04:06.604
I'd have to have
lost something.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.338
There it is.

04:13.976 --> 04:15.714
The Great Tree.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.098
Oh... wow.

04:18.432 --> 04:21.142
You know, Adira said
the inside is hollowed out,

04:21.228 --> 04:23.768
and it's the fastest way
through those mountains.

04:24.008 --> 04:25.479
Ugh. Adira.

04:25.565 --> 04:26.939
Okay, it'll be dark soon.

04:27.024 --> 04:28.893
We should head
back to camp and

04:28.979 --> 04:30.395
set out here in the morning.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.444
You're right.
Race ya!

04:32.529 --> 04:33.987
And it's official this time!

04:34.073 --> 04:36.487
Oh, it is so on.

04:44.674 --> 04:45.946
Okay.

04:46.059 --> 04:48.829
The Great Tree is
just over that ridge.

04:48.915 --> 04:50.266
Ya know, I gotta say,

04:50.352 --> 04:51.774
when we aren't fighting
bad guys,

04:51.860 --> 04:53.719
running from fish people
or being turned into birds,

04:53.804 --> 04:55.654
life on the road
can be pretty peaceful.

04:55.739 --> 04:57.589
Scissors beats paper!

04:57.674 --> 04:59.657
Of course,
scissors beats paper.

04:59.742 --> 05:02.240
But this
isn't paper.

05:02.325 --> 05:04.142
This
is a karate chop.

05:04.227 --> 05:05.830
Used properly by
an experienced practitioner,

05:05.915 --> 05:09.633
it can be the sharpest, most precise
cutting weapon in the world.

05:09.756 --> 05:13.415
Hence, karate chop beats...
scissors.

05:13.516 --> 05:16.040
Guys! Guys! Guys!
What is going on?

05:16.190 --> 05:17.813
We wanna see
who's gonna clean our room

05:17.899 --> 05:19.430
by playing rock,
paper, scissors,

05:19.562 --> 05:21.321
but he keeps tryin'
to cheat!

05:21.407 --> 05:23.127
Cheat?

05:23.212 --> 05:25.211
How dare you, sir!

05:25.304 --> 05:26.376
He's lying, Eugene!

05:26.485 --> 05:27.532
Really?

05:27.946 --> 05:30.219
Scissors always beats paper!

05:31.133 --> 05:33.743
And karate chop
always beats scissors!

05:33.829 --> 05:35.399
Hey!

05:37.094 --> 05:39.664
I'm suddenly missing last night,
when it was just you and me.

05:41.295 --> 05:42.671
Speaking of last night,
Raps.

05:42.756 --> 05:43.993
That jump you and Max took...

05:44.079 --> 05:46.938
Oh, you mean the jump
that won us the race?

05:47.064 --> 05:49.020
It wasn't a race.

05:49.176 --> 05:50.785
But yeah,
that one.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.344
It was kinda reckless.

05:52.429 --> 05:54.805
Cass, you of all people
should know

05:54.915 --> 05:57.352
I can handle myself
pretty well out here.

05:57.446 --> 06:00.675
I don't need someone
to keep me safe.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.875
Have no fear, the peacekeeper
worked his magic...

06:17.961 --> 06:19.137
Aah!

06:22.901 --> 06:25.055
Why are we just
standing here?

06:25.363 --> 06:26.363
Run!

06:42.855 --> 06:45.330
Anyone want to take a guess
as to who rhino man is?

06:45.465 --> 06:47.379
I am happy
to hazard a guess.

06:47.464 --> 06:48.660
Anyone other than Shorty.

06:48.746 --> 06:50.621
Wow. A rhinoceros.

06:50.707 --> 06:52.817
Oh! I never thought
I'd actually see one.

06:52.902 --> 06:54.605
I gotta say,
if it weren't chasing us

06:54.691 --> 06:56.005
and our lives weren't on the line...

06:56.090 --> 06:57.709
Blondie, it is and they are!

06:57.794 --> 06:59.035
Uh, right!

07:03.414 --> 07:05.082
We can't outrun it!

07:07.450 --> 07:09.746
Maybe
we don't have to.

07:09.919 --> 07:11.789
I hope this works.
Ready?

07:11.874 --> 07:12.771
One...

07:12.856 --> 07:14.038
Two...

07:14.176 --> 07:15.960
Three!

07:16.045 --> 07:17.045
Yes!

07:19.119 --> 07:20.588
Come on, Max!

07:21.465 --> 07:24.592
Uh, Princess? Watch your flank.

07:26.537 --> 07:28.963
He's still after her.
We gotta get down there!

07:29.505 --> 07:31.133
Huh?

07:32.109 --> 07:34.093
Max, you keep up with the others.

07:34.178 --> 07:35.580
I'll take care of these...

07:35.665 --> 07:38.340
Ooh, I wanna call them
wolf-monkeys, right?

07:39.616 --> 07:40.618
Uh-oh.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.469
Weeeee!

07:43.554 --> 07:45.948
- Shorty!
- Giddy-up!

07:59.570 --> 08:01.806
None shall enter the Dark Kingdom!

08:01.891 --> 08:04.667
This brings back memories!

08:07.176 --> 08:08.378
Gotcha!

08:09.378 --> 08:11.885
Whoa!

08:14.507 --> 08:16.152
- Hello, Blondie.
- Hi.

08:19.422 --> 08:20.976
Little help out here?

08:32.883 --> 08:33.984
Adira.

08:34.110 --> 08:36.774
I see you've gotten yourself
into another situation

08:36.859 --> 08:38.804
from which
I must rescue you.

08:47.324 --> 08:49.744
Adira? Yo. How's my hair?

08:53.189 --> 08:55.713
You can't protect them,
Adira!

08:55.799 --> 08:57.028
You know this guy?!

08:57.113 --> 08:58.787
What does he want?

09:01.265 --> 09:03.245
Guys, don't mean to be
a backseat driver,

09:03.330 --> 09:05.540
but we're gonna run off the cliff!

09:06.270 --> 09:09.264
If we're gonna go, we're gonna go big.

09:09.502 --> 09:11.918
I need you
to dig deep

09:12.004 --> 09:14.045
and put some distance
between us and them.

09:14.185 --> 09:15.895
You can do it!

09:48.978 --> 09:51.496
Seriously, there had to be
an easier way

09:51.581 --> 09:53.576
for us to hang out together.
Am I right?

09:59.799 --> 10:01.095
Two years ago,

10:01.181 --> 10:02.837
I'd call fighting
jackal monsters

10:02.923 --> 10:04.528
on the back of
a speeding carriage

10:04.613 --> 10:06.806
whilst a rhinoceros chases
the woman I love

10:06.892 --> 10:08.566
absolutely bonkers.

10:08.743 --> 10:10.692
Now I call it Tuesday.

10:11.704 --> 10:13.185
Time to get some answers.

10:13.271 --> 10:14.962
You probably didn't hear me,

10:15.048 --> 10:16.736
but I'm the one
who told the princess

10:16.822 --> 10:18.018
to run the caravan off the cliff.

10:18.103 --> 10:20.058
So really, I saved us.

10:20.158 --> 10:21.894
Don't feel like
you have to thank me.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.767
But you can if you want.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.142
I get it, I get it. You got stuff to do.
You're welcome!

10:27.237 --> 10:28.431
Adira, wait.

10:28.817 --> 10:31.009
Who was that man
that attacked us?

10:31.103 --> 10:33.825
And don't give us any of your
cryptic runaround talk.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.861
His name is Hector.

10:35.993 --> 10:38.072
And I don't think
I appreciate your tone.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.650
Oh!

10:40.267 --> 10:42.439
I'm sorry I gave you
the impression I care about

10:42.525 --> 10:45.103
- the things you appreciate.
- All right, all right.

10:45.392 --> 10:46.751
Who is Hector?

10:46.837 --> 10:48.599
He's a member
of the Brotherhood,

10:48.861 --> 10:52.004
a group of warriors sworn
to keep any and all away

10:52.089 --> 10:53.344
from the Dark Kingdom.

10:53.429 --> 10:55.134
Dark Kingdom?

10:55.875 --> 10:57.481
That's where we're headed.

10:57.743 --> 11:00.251
How many are
in this brotherhood?

11:00.337 --> 11:01.384
Not many.

11:01.550 --> 11:03.622
But you've encountered one
before today.

11:03.707 --> 11:06.353
Quirin, father of Varian.

11:07.587 --> 11:11.689
But none of the brothers is as
dangerous or sadistic as Hector.

11:12.252 --> 11:15.915
And this is his domain...
The Great Tree.

11:16.338 --> 11:20.257
He's sworn to stay here to ensure
no one crosses these mountains.

11:20.443 --> 11:23.118
And how do you know
so much about all of this?

11:23.267 --> 11:25.842
Let's just say some of us
in the Brotherhood

11:26.025 --> 11:28.337
disagree
on a couple of things.

11:28.658 --> 11:32.430
All right, so we have to go
through crazy rhino guy's house

11:32.515 --> 11:34.132
to get to
this Dark Kingdom?

11:34.298 --> 11:36.787
Guys, we barely got away from
this Hector with our lives,

11:36.872 --> 11:38.767
and now we're going to
trust her

11:38.853 --> 11:40.533
and go through his home turf?

11:40.673 --> 11:41.725
I don't like it.

11:41.821 --> 11:44.868
Well, like it or not,
it's our only choice.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.927
Your call, Blondie.

11:53.236 --> 11:55.189
I'm going with Adira
on this.

11:58.775 --> 12:01.994
Guys, let's go through that tree.

12:04.884 --> 12:06.158
Fine.

12:19.001 --> 12:21.141
The Great Tree.

12:25.302 --> 12:27.752
It's beautiful.

12:27.837 --> 12:29.040
Yeah, it's great.

12:29.126 --> 12:30.532
But we need to keep moving

12:30.618 --> 12:32.344
if we want to stay
ahead of Hector.

12:35.829 --> 12:37.525
Whoa.

12:37.664 --> 12:38.954
Thanks, buddy.

12:42.606 --> 12:45.454
That was close.

12:46.868 --> 12:48.618
Guys, look!

12:51.995 --> 12:54.278
Uh, it looks like
the only way across

12:54.363 --> 12:55.700
is to go all the way up one road...

12:55.785 --> 12:57.785
And down the other.

12:57.918 --> 13:00.160
Then I guess that's what
we gotta do. Come on.

13:00.536 --> 13:01.739
This place gives me
the creeps.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.354
Ugh. Me too.

13:03.439 --> 13:06.168
That's probably because
this tree was once known

13:06.254 --> 13:09.074
as the Tree of Zhan Tiri.

13:10.713 --> 13:11.863
Wait, wait, wait.

13:11.949 --> 13:13.813
The ancient sorcerer
whose magic

13:13.899 --> 13:15.386
caused a deadly snowstorm

13:15.472 --> 13:17.268
that nearly destroyed
Corona?

13:17.353 --> 13:19.146
And let's not forget his little
art teacher buddy

13:19.231 --> 13:20.168
who turned you into a zombie.

13:20.254 --> 13:22.254
You might
have mentioned Zhan Tiri

13:22.340 --> 13:23.973
before you dragged us in
here.

13:24.059 --> 13:26.285
It's perfectly harmless now.

13:29.332 --> 13:30.918
Millennia ago,

13:31.064 --> 13:35.852
<i>this tree was once a sentient
being, a force for good.</i>

13:36.039 --> 13:39.168
<i>But it was corrupted
by the evil sorcerer</i>

13:39.254 --> 13:41.738
<i>to destroy any
who approached.</i>

13:42.211 --> 13:44.285
<i>It was Zhan Tiri's
stronghold.</i>

13:44.371 --> 13:46.935
<i>Inside it,
he was invincible.</i>

13:47.183 --> 13:48.528
<i>But Lord Demanitus...</i>

13:48.614 --> 13:53.449
<i>put a stop to the tree's magic
using an enchanted spear.</i>

13:59.563 --> 14:02.515
So you see,
you have nothing to fear.

14:02.765 --> 14:04.524
The evil magic is long gone.

14:04.688 --> 14:07.353
But more importantly,
you're with me.

14:07.454 --> 14:09.985
Well, it is a long way up.

14:10.251 --> 14:12.434
We'd better get a move on.

14:14.778 --> 14:16.781
Look, Adira,
you may have sold my friends

14:16.866 --> 14:19.345
on you being the wise,
but kooky, old mentor,

14:19.435 --> 14:22.199
but I'm not buying it.
I'm watching you.

14:22.284 --> 14:23.687
Well, if that's what
you want,

14:23.772 --> 14:25.103
be my guest.

14:25.422 --> 14:27.057
But as a servant
of the princess,

14:27.142 --> 14:29.868
isn't it your job
to watch her?

14:29.985 --> 14:31.220
I'm not a servant.

14:31.306 --> 14:34.853
Oh, I thought that's what
a lady-in-waiting was.

15:01.890 --> 15:05.254
Looks like our job
isn't done yet.

15:26.202 --> 15:27.522
You think Adira would like these?

15:27.608 --> 15:29.733
Um... Lance, buddy.

15:29.858 --> 15:31.905
About this whole
Adira thing...

15:32.184 --> 15:33.765
Let me see,
how do I put this?

15:34.089 --> 15:36.241
But have you considered
the possibility

15:36.327 --> 15:40.460
that maybe, big maybe,
Adira might not be into...

15:41.698 --> 15:42.858
..interested in you at all?

15:42.944 --> 15:45.421
Not interested?
Of course she is.

15:45.507 --> 15:47.749
Look at me.
What's not to love?

15:48.397 --> 15:49.827
Well, for one.

15:49.921 --> 15:52.702
You might want to
think about being a bit more...

15:52.954 --> 15:54.975
Uh, how do I say? Honest.

15:55.890 --> 15:57.366
Me? Not honest?

15:57.547 --> 16:00.319
Name one thing I've done that
hasn't been on the up and up.

16:00.405 --> 16:03.232
Well, you took the last apple
at breakfast and blamed Max,

16:03.318 --> 16:04.788
then you cheated
playing rock, paper, scissors,

16:04.873 --> 16:06.628
also you took credit
for saving the group

16:06.713 --> 16:09.007
from all of the things
we've already done right now

16:09.093 --> 16:10.249
because you're a big galoot.

16:10.335 --> 16:11.725
Of course
I'm not gonna seem honest

16:11.811 --> 16:13.960
if you point out
all the times I lie.

16:14.270 --> 16:15.429
Wait.

16:16.787 --> 16:18.593
Where are the others?

16:23.082 --> 16:24.800
Where is the war?

16:39.381 --> 16:41.904
It looks like
there's something up there.

16:52.443 --> 16:54.591
What is this place?

16:59.078 --> 17:00.773
Eugene, look at...

17:00.859 --> 17:03.265
Wait.
Where is Eugene and Lance?

17:03.351 --> 17:05.116
- Where's Max?
- Where's Pascal?

17:05.201 --> 17:06.789
Where's Shorty?

17:06.875 --> 17:09.858
Okay, uh...
We should circle back and...

17:16.509 --> 17:17.726
What does it mean?

17:17.836 --> 17:19.196
No one knows for sure.

17:19.281 --> 17:20.597
But many have perished

17:20.683 --> 17:22.460
trying to unravel
its mystery.

17:22.594 --> 17:24.608
Well, someone translated
some of it.

17:25.505 --> 17:29.828
"Flower gleam and glow,
let your powers shine..."

17:30.054 --> 17:32.945
It's the healing incantation
for the sun drop.

17:33.195 --> 17:35.664
This must be where
it came from.

17:39.999 --> 17:42.577
Blondie? Cass?

17:43.453 --> 17:45.609
Well, they have taken
the other path.

17:51.426 --> 17:54.367
Hey, you think
Adira would like this?

18:00.142 --> 18:02.064
Lance, would you just...

18:09.575 --> 18:11.220
Oh!
Oh! Gotcha!

18:12.361 --> 18:14.431
I an really sorry
that I called you dishonest.

18:14.537 --> 18:16.173
- Ah, forget it.
- I really am.

18:16.259 --> 18:17.856
- You were right.
- I think you're just perfect.

18:17.941 --> 18:20.595
Thanks buddy.
You're my best buddy, buddy.

It's another incantation.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.283
Another sun drop incantation?

20:56.369 --> 20:59.494
No, not the sun drop.

20:59.975 --> 21:01.493
The moon stone.

21:01.666 --> 21:03.908
The sun drop's power was
to heal.

21:04.095 --> 21:05.947

22:37.372 --> 22:40.764
I'd say we're about
to get eaten by a flower.

22:40.849 --> 22:43.630
You are spot-on. And it looks
like I'm going in headfirst.

22:43.747 --> 22:46.604
Well, I guess this is goodbye,
huh?

22:46.689 --> 22:47.958
I mean, if you gotta go,

22:48.083 --> 22:50.293
I couldn't think of a better
guy to go out with.

22:50.378 --> 22:52.380
Ha! Right back at ya,
buddy.

23:01.752 --> 23:03.793
Max, Pascal!

23:03.895 --> 23:05.316
Thank goodness
you guys are here.

23:05.402 --> 23:06.857
Yeah, I need help.

23:06.943 --> 23:09.442
Do you think Adira
would like these flowers?

23:09.528 --> 23:11.706
I mean, not the one
that's about to eat us.

24:04.533 --> 24:09.197
Whither and decay,
end this destiny.

24:09.437 --> 24:14.439
Break these earthly chains
and set the spirit free.

24:17.320 --> 24:21.773
Whither and decay,
end this destiny.

24:21.983 --> 24:24.384
Rapunzel, stop!

24:24.595 --> 24:26.228
Please.

24:28.312 --> 24:32.875
Whither and decay,
end this destiny.

24:33.882 --> 24:35.345
Rapunzel!

24:37.962 --> 24:39.297
Raps?

24:42.471 --> 24:43.681
Raps?

24:43.799 --> 24:45.626
No, no, no. Please.

24:49.811 --> 24:52.222
That was unexpected.

24:52.406 --> 24:55.011
Oh, you're okay.
I'm sorry, Raps.

24:55.230 --> 24:57.655
I'm supposed to protect you.

24:57.933 --> 24:59.753
It's okay, Cass.

24:59.948 --> 25:02.149
Thank you, Adira.

25:17.572 --> 25:21.001
Rapunzel, what's up?

25:43.465 --> 25:46.850
Whoo! Whoa.
It's a long way down.

25:46.935 --> 25:49.661
I guess this means
we're at the halfway point.

25:49.818 --> 25:52.269
I suggest we camp out here
for the night.

25:52.504 --> 25:55.645
No way. We are getting out of
this tree as soon as possible.

25:55.785 --> 25:57.840
I'm not sure that's your call, kid.

25:57.926 --> 26:02.059
Cass, we could use the rest.

26:02.325 --> 26:05.376
Rapunzel, this place almost
got us killed an hour ago.

26:05.470 --> 26:07.707
And thankfully,
I was there to prevent it.

26:07.793 --> 26:09.387
You stay out of this, Adira!

26:09.473 --> 26:10.996
I think you should
calm down.

26:11.082 --> 26:12.254
You know
what I think?

26:12.411 --> 26:13.742
I think you're playing us.

26:13.828 --> 26:15.598
I think you led us here
on purpose,

26:15.684 --> 26:17.825
and from some sick reason,
you wanted Rapunzel

26:17.911 --> 26:20.012
to find that
incantation and read it.

26:20.098 --> 26:22.947
Come on, Cass.
Listen to yourself.

26:23.071 --> 26:24.614
Rapunzel, I'm telling you
right now,

26:24.700 --> 26:25.841
we need to get out of this tree,

26:25.926 --> 26:28.082
but more importantly,
we need to lose Adira

26:28.168 --> 26:29.847
before she gets us all killed.

26:30.097 --> 26:32.428
I can't do that, Cass.

26:32.582 --> 26:34.417
What do you mean
you can't do that?

26:34.645 --> 26:35.723
Of course you can.

26:35.809 --> 26:38.106
Are you that obliviously naive
that you can't see...

26:38.192 --> 26:40.121
Enough, Cassandra!

26:45.814 --> 26:48.262
No one is getting rid of
anyone.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.059
Is that clear?

26:56.565 --> 26:58.512
Yes, Your Highness.

26:59.541 --> 27:01.621
I'll keep first watch.

27:11.239 --> 27:13.762
This is amazing.

27:14.161 --> 27:16.082
You haven't seen
anything yet, Your Highness.

27:16.173 --> 27:17.923
This is just the east wing.

27:18.009 --> 27:20.942
I still can't get over that library.

27:21.239 --> 27:23.481
Are you sure that
I can go anytime I want?

27:23.754 --> 27:27.082
You're the princess.
You can do whatever you want.

27:28.703 --> 27:31.309
Forgive me, Your Highness,
but I couldn't help but notice

27:31.394 --> 27:34.011
you tend to collect...
everything.

27:34.096 --> 27:35.465
I can't help it.

27:35.551 --> 27:37.286
It's all so new.

27:37.379 --> 27:40.807
That's why I got you something
you might find useful.

27:41.887 --> 27:44.878
Oh my gosh. Cassandra!

27:45.587 --> 27:47.762
Thank you! I love it.

27:47.848 --> 27:49.639
This is so thoughtful.

27:49.724 --> 27:52.797
Look at it. I can put
all kinds of things inside it.

27:52.882 --> 27:56.313
Books and fruit, and paint
supplies, seashells.

27:56.398 --> 27:59.270
Yeah, you can put
whatever you want in it.

27:59.597 --> 28:01.637
- Thank you so much.
- Oh!

28:01.832 --> 28:04.403
Okay. Huh, sure.

28:04.489 --> 28:05.974
And not just for this gift,

28:06.060 --> 28:09.184
but for everything you've
shown me these past few days.

28:09.301 --> 28:13.196
I am so, so lucky
to have someone like you

28:13.281 --> 28:16.533
that I can trust
and to help me adjust.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.456
I don't know what I would do
here without you.

28:19.770 --> 28:22.223
You're a good friend, Cassandra.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.783
Call me Cass,
Your Highness.

28:25.364 --> 28:28.889
Only if you call me Rapunzel,
Cass.

28:39.215 --> 28:40.711
I don't get it, Eugene.

28:40.796 --> 28:43.926
I have never seen Cass
act like this before.

28:44.145 --> 28:47.129
Yeah. Angry, brooding,
impatient, I'm stunned.

28:47.286 --> 28:48.803
You know what I mean.

28:48.903 --> 28:53.231
Ever since we left Corona,
she's been... different.

28:54.114 --> 28:57.512
Because she is.
We all are, Blondie.

28:57.725 --> 29:00.330
We've all had to make some
adjustments since leaving Corona.

29:00.415 --> 29:02.532
We're not the same people
we were six months ago

29:02.617 --> 29:05.207
and well, why would Cass
be any different?

29:05.310 --> 29:08.434
It's just that ever since
I've known Cass,

29:08.879 --> 29:11.418
it's like she seems so
together.

29:11.574 --> 29:13.594
You, of all people,
should know

29:13.680 --> 29:16.020
things aren't always
what they seem.

29:25.895 --> 29:29.393
So, earlier...
that got awkward, huh?

29:29.543 --> 29:31.332
Huh. Which part?

29:31.418 --> 29:34.559
I know.
It's been an unusual day.

29:34.675 --> 29:36.714
You know it's not just
about Adira, right?

29:36.886 --> 29:39.911
I mean, she's a jerk and I can't
stand her, but it's just...

29:40.056 --> 29:42.327
Since when did you stop
trusting my judgement?

29:42.481 --> 29:46.379
Cass, you are the closest thing

29:46.715 --> 29:49.110
that I will have
to a big sister.

29:49.211 --> 29:50.981
But I'm not
that naive girl

29:51.067 --> 29:52.649
fresh out of the tower
anymore.

29:52.734 --> 29:55.265
I am going to be
queen someday.

29:55.350 --> 29:58.569
And I can promise you,
I'm going to make decisions

29:58.654 --> 30:00.653
that you're going to
disagree with,

30:00.739 --> 30:03.145
and I need you
to be okay with that.

30:05.728 --> 30:07.989
Well, I better get some rest.

30:11.278 --> 30:13.434

Now I gotta finish you.

32:55.610 --> 32:57.177
Let her go, Hector.

32:58.844 --> 32:59.880
Heh.

33:16.518 --> 33:17.993
Adira!

33:18.079 --> 33:20.977
And just so
we won't be interrupted.

33:28.329 --> 33:29.499
Ah!

33:30.531 --> 33:31.892
Now then...

33:51.520 --> 33:54.558
It's sad to see the once mighty Adira

33:54.643 --> 33:57.585
waste her life on a fool's dream.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.468
Talk about wasting lives...

34:03.731 --> 34:06.303
You and the brothers
spent yours hiding something

34:06.388 --> 34:08.452
no one was even
looking for.

34:08.616 --> 34:12.202
The moon stone has the power
to destroy the world.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.411
Keeping its existence secret
was the king's wish.

34:15.545 --> 34:18.734
And to do anything
otherwise is treason!

34:31.926 --> 34:34.911
I've seen the sun drop's power
firsthand, Hector.

34:34.996 --> 34:38.286
And so will you when we return
to the Dark Kingdom.

34:38.420 --> 34:40.568
That'll never happen.

34:44.068 --> 34:46.233
I'm sorry it came to this, sister.

34:50.811 --> 34:52.186
And now...

34:54.681 --> 34:58.400
for the so called sun drop.

35:00.187 --> 35:01.915
Leave her alone.

35:05.867 --> 35:08.049
Brave child.

35:10.666 --> 35:13.015
Stupid, but brave.

35:13.100 --> 35:14.238
You want the sun drop?

35:14.323 --> 35:15.947
You gotta go through me first.

35:16.033 --> 35:17.047
'Kay.

35:19.540 --> 35:21.044
You wanna try that again?

35:21.129 --> 35:22.636
Well, come on.

35:27.883 --> 35:32.213
Tell me, lady-in-waiting...

35:34.522 --> 35:36.093
what are you waiting for?

35:36.316 --> 35:38.019
Funny you should ask.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.385
Cassandra!

36:10.673 --> 36:15.033
The heart
of Zhan Tiri's Tree.

36:17.197 --> 36:22.228
Forgive me for unleashing
the evil that sleeps within.

36:28.109 --> 36:31.345
For King Edmund.

36:56.604 --> 36:57.718
You hear that?

36:58.307 --> 37:01.632
Yeah, in my experience, growing
rumbles never lead to good things.

37:14.823 --> 37:22.041
All who enter the Great Tree of
Zhan Tiri shall be destroyed!

37:29.012 --> 37:31.018
The tree! It's alive.

37:31.104 --> 37:32.966
Do you remember when
being chased by a rhino

37:33.051 --> 37:35.791
was the weirdest thing
we had to do this weekend?

37:44.669 --> 37:45.905
Cass!

37:47.022 --> 37:48.024
Watch out.

37:50.275 --> 37:52.637
Gotta watch that flank.

38:21.622 --> 38:23.224
Cassandra!

38:25.292 --> 38:26.361
Hook!

38:28.196 --> 38:29.332
Eugene!

38:54.856 --> 38:55.917
Raps, wait.

38:56.003 --> 38:58.152
You can't do that
incantation again.

38:58.546 --> 39:00.910
I don't have a choice, Cass.

39:00.995 --> 39:03.410
Please, Raps.
That spear can kill it.

39:03.550 --> 39:06.527
Let me try and grab it. Trust me.

39:07.228 --> 39:08.844
Eugene.

39:08.999 --> 39:10.597
I have to do this.

39:10.683 --> 39:12.027
No!

39:14.843 --> 39:18.894
Whither and decay,
end this destiny.

39:19.128 --> 39:24.200
Break these earthly chains,
and set the spirit free.

39:30.292 --> 39:34.758
Whither and decay,
end this destiny.

39:35.062 --> 39:39.691
Break these earthly chains,
and set the spirit free.

39:39.868 --> 39:43.974
- Whither and decay, end this destiny.
- Rapunzel!

39:44.175 --> 39:48.392
Break these earthly chains... Lance, go!

39:48.477 --> 39:50.870
- But, Princess...
- Now!

40:00.155 --> 40:02.276
I got this, Cass. Go!

40:02.393 --> 40:03.973
You heard her.
Let's go.

40:04.058 --> 40:05.495
No. I'm not leaving her.

40:05.580 --> 40:07.526
Raps, please let go.

40:07.612 --> 40:09.999
Break these earthly chains...

40:10.214 --> 40:11.409
I can't!

40:11.732 --> 40:13.669
- And set the spirit free.
- What are you waiting for?

40:13.754 --> 40:16.136
I can't control it.

40:23.526 --> 40:25.302
Cass, no!

40:26.647 --> 40:29.349
I... I could have stopped it.

40:29.435 --> 40:31.286
You should have let me try.

40:31.653 --> 40:33.236
Listen.

40:33.427 --> 40:35.292
You're friend is right.

40:35.427 --> 40:37.427
Adira is lying to you.

40:37.959 --> 40:40.114
She... She might have you think

40:40.200 --> 40:42.298
she's helping you
to find your destiny,

40:42.383 --> 40:47.021
but if you go to the Dark Kingdom,
you're doomed.

40:49.913 --> 40:51.596
No!

40:51.939 --> 40:55.392
Rapunzel, stay on the path.

40:55.522 --> 40:58.538
All our destiny's lie
within you.

41:01.448 --> 41:02.651
Adira!

41:47.061 --> 41:49.146
Oh, Cass. Your hand.

41:49.231 --> 41:50.533
Are you okay?

41:50.618 --> 41:52.414
Yes, I'm fine.

41:52.670 --> 41:55.131
- Are you sure?
- I said I'm fine.

41:55.334 --> 41:56.872
But you're hurt.

41:57.529 --> 41:59.455
I know.

42:00.123 --> 42:02.240
But it won't happen again.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.873
So, what now?

42:23.420 --> 42:25.365
It's your call, Raps.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.686
This path has been laid out
for me.

42:37.461 --> 42:39.436
There is no turning back.

42:40.272 --> 42:42.943
I am going to the Dark Kingdom.
