WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.168
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:03.170 --> 00:05.304
- Whoo, girl.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.139
All is not lost.

00:07.141 --> 00:07.940
- No way.

00:07.942 --> 00:10.576
- You still have a chance
to return.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.578
- Wait, does this mean
I get to come back?

00:12.580 --> 00:16.148
- For your revenge.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.049
- What?

00:17.051 --> 00:20.419
- Alyssa Edwards,
sashay away.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.189
- I am sick
of hearing them say,

00:24.191 --> 00:25.524
you can wear shit
on stage,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.292
but it's okay
'cause you're Alyssa.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.027
It was sloppy.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.728
To me,
she was more concerned

00:29.730 --> 00:33.799
about throwing you two under
the bus during deliberations.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.101
- Oh, my God!

00:36.103 --> 00:37.836
- Trust the Duchess.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.539
It ain't over
just yet, baby.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.345
- Oh, my God!

00:46.347 --> 00:47.646
- Bitch!

00:47.648 --> 00:48.447
- What's going on here?

00:48.449 --> 00:52.284
- Do you remember when you were
in high school on the phone

00:52.286 --> 00:53.452
and you were like, girl,

00:53.454 --> 00:55.621
I can't stand her,
she is so fake.

00:55.623 --> 00:56.455
And then
your friend was like,

00:56.457 --> 00:59.224
well, Melissa, what
do you think about that?

00:59.226 --> 01:00.092
And they were on three-way.

01:00.094 --> 01:03.028
Phi Phi's crack was
that three-way phone call

01:03.030 --> 01:04.630
in high school cracked.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.366
(laughs)

01:07.368 --> 01:11.270
- (cheering)
- Oh, no, no, no!

01:12.039 --> 01:14.206
- Come on.

01:17.445 --> 01:20.779
(cheering)

01:20.781 --> 01:22.648
- Oh, the two-in-one look.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.483
- What's up, hookers?

01:25.820 --> 01:28.187
- Oh!
- Come on, Minj.

01:28.189 --> 01:31.190
- Aw!
- Whoo!

01:31.192 --> 01:35.094
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:36.497 --> 01:40.032
- I'm back, back, back,
back, back again.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.100
- Oh, my God.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.969
- So Phi Phi was just running
off at the mouth about Alyssa,

01:43.971 --> 01:45.838
and then all of a sudden,
there's Alyssa

01:45.840 --> 01:49.475
staring dead in her eyes,
and it's like...

01:51.512 --> 01:56.081
- Before we go on, Phi Phi
obviously has a lot to say.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.884
- I mean, if you want to act
all foolish

01:58.886 --> 02:00.018
in front of the cameras,
we could,

02:00.020 --> 02:03.355
but you said yourself
it's not personal, it's drag.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.089
These are my opinions.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.290
- So why couldn't you
say that to me, though?

02:05.292 --> 02:06.592
- I didn't need to.
I was sitting there--

02:06.594 --> 02:07.593
- You're that girl.
I knew you were.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.560
- You know what?
You're looking foolish

02:08.562 --> 02:10.796
by sitting there
and acting like a child.

02:10.798 --> 02:11.630
- So you know what?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.833
- So you can do that
and that'll be cute. I'm done.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.602
- Let me just respond
to this real quick.

02:16.604 --> 02:20.772
I ain't never been nobody
to not be 100 to the face.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.208
I didn't throw you or you
under the bus.

02:23.210 --> 02:26.111
Did I say everything I said
to you to y'all?

02:26.113 --> 02:27.246
Did I not over there?

02:27.248 --> 02:28.180
- You did, you did.
- Thank you.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.449
- All right. You can play
the victim, go ahead.

02:30.885 --> 02:31.884
- Being the victim
of what, girl?

02:31.886 --> 02:34.119
I just sat right there and heard
everything you had to say,

02:34.121 --> 02:36.355
and you didn't say
none of that to me.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.689
I was just in the room
with you.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.626
We grown folk, but okay.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.327
- I think it's funny
that you do want to come in

02:42.329 --> 02:44.329
and play the victim,
because you had no problem

02:44.331 --> 02:45.531
sending me home
last week, girl.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.365
- Oh, I'm nobody's victim.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.900
I had no problem
sending you home.

02:47.902 --> 02:49.401
I gave a reasoning
why I did, too.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.471
- But I felt like your reasoning
was bullshit.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.940
- I say consistency.
It was not personal.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.675
- I didn't say
it was personal.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.776
- That was
a really tough night,

02:57.778 --> 02:59.378
because I was expecting
to go home.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.080
- Yeah, well, and I wouldn't
have let you go home.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.282
- What?

03:03.284 --> 03:06.051
- I feel like
you deserved to stay.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.254
- Last week, the bottom two
were Ginger and Katya.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.455
So are you
basically saying

03:10.457 --> 03:14.059
you wanted me to choose
Katya to go home,

03:14.061 --> 03:15.460
and then you would
nominate yourself

03:15.462 --> 03:17.696
to go home instead of her?

03:17.698 --> 03:21.066
I smell a stunt.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.202
Ginger, she just came off
of winning.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.103
If it was a strategic way,

03:25.105 --> 03:27.439
I probably
would've sent her home.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.208
- Okay.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.910
- I just think my issue
has been standing there

03:31.912 --> 03:34.012
hearing that I throw
people under the bus.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.647
That's not me.
That's not my gig.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.349
Never has been.
Never will be.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.116
- I said I felt.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.218
Now, if you want
to sit there and talk shit

03:39.220 --> 03:42.454
about how I'm feeling, then that
just speaks on your character.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.223
I said I felt, coming
from sitting there--

03:44.225 --> 03:46.792
- Relax, Phi Phi, relax.
Take a deep breath, sweetie.

03:46.794 --> 03:47.960
- Don't try to play
the victim, boo.

03:47.962 --> 03:49.861
Alyssa's trying to play
this little victim card

03:49.863 --> 03:52.197
in front of everybody,
and I'm not buying that.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.999
Girl, you threw people
under the bus.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.400
You're just upset
that I called it out

03:55.402 --> 03:58.737
and you had to hear
that I called it out.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.672
- Everything I heard
and knew about her,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.307
I'm glad she validated it.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.609
- You can say
whatever you want,

04:03.611 --> 04:05.410
but you know what,
I played fair.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.579
I played who I thought Ru
was gonna go home,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.214
so do not get mad
because I said

04:09.216 --> 04:10.349
that I was gonna play it
that way.

04:10.351 --> 04:14.519
You choose to do what you want
with someone else's words

04:14.521 --> 04:15.821
and let them affect you,

04:15.823 --> 04:18.457
and that's exactly
what she's doing right now.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.158
You can't get upset
because you were eliminated

04:20.160 --> 04:25.364
and someone had their opinions
on why you should be gone.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.033
- Miss Phi Phi
is getting defensive.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.067
Here's my thing.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.702
I don't mind
all the theatrics,

04:30.704 --> 04:34.206
but if you gonna be loud
and rowdy-rowdy

04:34.208 --> 04:36.308
and think you're
a bawdy-bawdy bitch,

04:36.310 --> 04:38.443
stand up and be one.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.912
But, girl,
don't be weak sauce.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.750
- It's about to get
real interesting.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.721
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars"

04:49.723 --> 04:51.023
receives a one-year supply

04:51.025 --> 04:53.425
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

04:53.427 --> 04:56.528
a coveted spot in
the Drag Race Hall of Fame,

04:56.530 --> 04:59.531
and a cash prize
of $100,000.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.301
- ¶ Drag Race,
may the best woman ¶

05:02.303 --> 05:05.037
¶ Best woman win ¶

05:08.208 --> 05:11.910
- Back to the back, back,
back, back, back, back, back.

05:11.912 --> 05:12.711
I'm here!

05:12.713 --> 05:14.913
- Welcome back.
- Well, hello to you!

05:14.915 --> 05:17.382
- So we were the top five,

05:17.384 --> 05:20.819
and now we are
the top nine again.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.621
We don't know
how this is gonna go down.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.689
I don't know
what's going on.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.191
I'm just here to look
pretty, that's it.

05:26.794 --> 05:30.228
- Hello, hello, hello.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.831
Oh, my God.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.366
Welcome back, strangers.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.534
- Hey.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.470
- It's time
for the returning queens

05:38.472 --> 05:40.806
to get their revenge,

05:40.808 --> 05:45.177
and I can't wait to see
who gets the last laugh.

05:45.179 --> 05:45.711
- Oh, God.

05:45.713 --> 05:49.781
- Because for this week's
AllStar maxi challenge,

05:49.783 --> 05:53.418
you'll be doing
a stand-up comedy show,

05:53.420 --> 05:56.655
and you'll be doing it...

05:56.657 --> 05:57.723
in pairs.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.391
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.259
- The top two
returning queens

06:01.261 --> 06:03.495
will lip sync for $10,000

06:03.497 --> 06:09.234
and the power to give
one of the bottom queens

06:09.236 --> 06:11.269
the chop.

06:11.271 --> 06:13.405
But most importantly,

06:13.407 --> 06:16.908
get the right to return
to the competition.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.478
#RevengeOfTheQueens

06:19.480 --> 06:22.280
- I'm good with this.
I'm good.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.985
- And one other
small little detail.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.322
Tomorrow,
you'll be performing

06:30.324 --> 06:31.857
in front of a live audience

06:31.859 --> 06:35.827
packed with
Drag Race Aluminati.

06:35.829 --> 06:36.995
- Oh, ho!

06:36.997 --> 06:39.297
- You know,
the queens you beat out

06:39.299 --> 06:41.633
to make it here
on "AllStars."

06:41.635 --> 06:43.168
- Oh, God.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.237
If we don't get pelted
with rotten vegetables,

06:45.239 --> 06:47.172
they're just gonna be
sitting there stone-faced

06:47.174 --> 06:50.475
with their eyes crossed,
giving us the middle finger.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.978
- Now, the returning queens

06:52.980 --> 06:55.480
get to pick
their comedy partner

06:55.482 --> 06:58.083
from those
still in the competition,

06:58.085 --> 07:03.054
starting with
the last queen eliminated.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.089
Alyssa Edwards.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.959
- I need a redo,
so I pick Alaska.

07:07.961 --> 07:08.660
- Ooh.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.494
- Girl, I choose Alaska

07:09.496 --> 07:13.064
because I have something to
prove to her as a partner.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.599
I'm gonna make it count.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.500
- Ginger Minj.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.069
- I'm gonna pick my BFF,
Katya.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.206
- Oh, thank God.
(laughs)

07:21.208 --> 07:22.641
- Tatianna.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.677
- I think I'm gonna go
with Detox.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.580
I picked Detox
to be my partner

07:28.582 --> 07:32.250
because she's funny,
she's dirty,

07:32.252 --> 07:35.787
and she's not Phi Phi
or Roxxxy.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.688
Choices.

07:36.690 --> 07:40.425
- And Coco Montrese,
who do you choose?

07:40.427 --> 07:41.893
- I'm gonna go with Phi Phi.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.495
- Phi Phi.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.898
Roxxxy Andrews,
since no one picked you,

07:46.900 --> 07:52.904
you'll be working solo
as the emcee of the show.

07:52.906 --> 07:53.805
And if you win,

07:53.807 --> 07:58.710
you will have the power
to chop a bottom queen

07:58.712 --> 08:03.882
and decide which one
of the eliminated queens

08:03.884 --> 08:05.350
gets to return.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.418
- What shit!

08:06.420 --> 08:08.253
- Can we start over?
(laughs)

08:08.255 --> 08:11.189
- Gentlemen,
start your engines

08:11.191 --> 08:14.659
and may
the best AllStar win.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.497
- So we know
what my character is.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.065
I'm Ru's cousin
from the projects.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.168
- I think I'm just gonna do
my ghetto chola.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.569
- Okay, that'll work.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.271
- I'm not good at writing
standup comedy.

08:26.273 --> 08:29.908
But I was thinking, like, maybe
we could pick apart our flaws.

08:29.910 --> 08:30.642
- I'm fine with that.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.878
- And we can talk about
how I'm no longer orange.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.046
- Girl, and I went
from orange to fudge.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.083
- You went from orange
to fudge.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.751
(laughs)

08:40.754 --> 08:42.821
- And they think
you have many faces,

08:42.823 --> 08:45.156
that type of thing.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.458
- I'm gonna be honest
with you.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.893
I think it's only one person
in this room

08:47.895 --> 08:49.060
that feels that way
about me.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.462
and I think
that's bullshit.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.297
Like this beef with Alyssa.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.566
I didn't come here for that.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.369
I mean, I've worked so hard

08:57.371 --> 08:58.803
with how to control things,

08:58.805 --> 09:02.807
and I almost let someone bring
me back to that unhappy place.

09:02.809 --> 09:03.675
- Yeah, but this the thing.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.611
Focus on you, 'cause mama
got to go to work.

09:07.414 --> 09:11.049
I really don't want
to get into this conflict

09:11.051 --> 09:12.317
between Alyssa and Phi Phi

09:12.319 --> 09:14.719
'cause I'm trying
to get back in the game.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.022
Oh, these girls.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.790
Oh.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.559
- Coming up...

09:20.561 --> 09:22.227
- I'm so glad that I got
to you in time, though.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.862
- Girl, in time for what?

09:23.864 --> 09:25.964
- Oh.
Mama, did you forget?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.132
I have the audition today.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.634
- Time out.
You got to make it funny.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.270
- Bea and I met
at our friend Patty's

09:32.272 --> 09:35.073
Pooches with Prolapse
garden party.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.608
(bleep) were out.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.879
(RuPaul laughs)

09:41.748 --> 09:44.883
(RuPaul laughs)

09:45.152 --> 09:47.752
- So Ru tells us in our
maxi challenge this week,

09:47.754 --> 09:50.722
the girl that has been
eliminated who wins

09:50.724 --> 09:55.293
is going to be sending home
somebody who's already here.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.263
So it's their turn
to get their Ru-venge.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.167
- So the last time
we were paired together,

10:02.169 --> 10:06.638
you ended up being in
the bottom and going home.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.606
- You got me.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.307
- I don't know
who sent you home.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.010
Whoever did, I will never
forgive them.

10:12.012 --> 10:12.577
- No, girl.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.814
Even though Alaska chose me
to leave the competition...

10:15.816 --> 10:16.648
- Alyssa Edwards.

10:16.650 --> 10:20.318
- I still have so much
mad respect for her,

10:20.320 --> 10:22.921
and I feel like the respect
is mutual between us.

10:22.923 --> 10:27.025
- Okay, I think we need
to play to your strengths.

10:27.027 --> 10:27.425
- Yes.

10:27.427 --> 10:31.262
- Your strengths
are off-the-cuff buffoonery,

10:31.264 --> 10:32.697
responsive, like you're--
- (laughs)

10:32.699 --> 10:35.333
- Yes, exactly.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.636
- Let's do it.
- For this challenge,

10:37.638 --> 10:41.139
I really want Alyssa
to have the freedom

10:41.141 --> 10:47.145
to go off on Alyssa
Edwardian tangents,

10:47.147 --> 10:48.480
'cause that's when
she's really funny

10:48.482 --> 10:49.914
and that's when
she succeeds.

10:49.916 --> 10:53.051
- You make an outline,
I can go with it on the fly.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.320
Now, I'm gonna have
my cleft notes.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.621
- Cliff's notes.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.423
Like the person's name
is Cliff.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.557
- Cliff's?
Who told you that?

10:59.559 --> 11:02.627
- I read them.
They're books.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.830
- Yes, exactly.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.099
- (laughs)

11:08.101 --> 11:09.901
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:09.903 --> 11:10.602
- How are you feeling?

11:10.604 --> 11:13.271
- Hosting is what I do
and I can do my best...

11:13.273 --> 11:14.139
- Right.

11:14.141 --> 11:14.906
- On my own.
I don't want

11:14.908 --> 11:17.208
what happened last week,
as far as the teams,

11:17.210 --> 11:18.443
you know,
somebody outshining me.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.111
And I would really love
to win this

11:20.113 --> 11:21.513
just to prove it to myself.
- Yeah.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.916
- Winning at being pretty
in challenge, I get it.

11:24.918 --> 11:25.717
That's what I do.

11:25.719 --> 11:29.287
Being funny
and showing that I've grown

11:29.289 --> 11:30.188
would mean even more to me.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.057
- You know how to
fuckin do this shit.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.858
- Oh, girl.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.227
- Katya and Ginger Minj.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.696
- Hi.
- Don't walk that fast.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.296
I have asthma.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.499
- So today, we have a coaching
session with Ross Matthews

11:41.501 --> 11:45.537
and special guest Chelsea
Peretti, who is hilarious.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.037
I love her.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.105
- (Russian accent)
Good evening, everybody.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.541
My name is Ekatarina
Petrovisamochkiva.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.643
I flew here all the way
from Russia,

11:51.645 --> 11:55.613
and, boy, are my arms
covered in track marks.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.881
- (laughs)

11:56.883 --> 11:59.050
- And I flew here
in first class,

11:59.052 --> 11:59.751
because unlike some,

11:59.753 --> 12:02.787
I actually made it
to the top three of season 7.

12:02.789 --> 12:05.056
- All right, stop.
What is the idea?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.458
- So it's like
we're friends,

12:06.460 --> 12:09.594
but I'm like the Russian hooker
and she's the--

12:09.596 --> 12:10.395
- Southern country belle.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.697
We kind of based it
on the fact that

12:12.699 --> 12:14.265
a lot of fans
were saying to her,

12:14.267 --> 12:15.700
"Why are you friends
with Ginger"

12:15.702 --> 12:16.534
She's a bitch."

12:16.536 --> 12:17.335
- You should explain that.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.270
- Yeah, like people think
we wouldn't be friends

12:19.272 --> 12:20.672
'cause I'm a this
and I'm a that.

12:20.674 --> 12:22.841
So that'll really set
the stage of who you are.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.876
- As different
as those two things can be.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.112
- As different as
those things can be--

12:27.114 --> 12:28.580
- No, no,
I'm just saying like...

12:28.582 --> 12:30.348
(all laugh)

12:30.350 --> 12:31.116
- I am so grateful

12:31.118 --> 12:33.418
to be going into
this challenge with Katya.

12:33.420 --> 12:37.122
This is just the pairing
that I need

12:37.124 --> 12:39.791
for a successful week
for me.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.160
- My name
is Lydia Ladybits.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.461
- And I'm Beatrice Backdoor.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.263
- Bea and I met
at our friend Patty's

12:45.265 --> 12:48.733
Pooches with Prolapse
garden party last year.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.268
- Everyone was wearing
pink socks.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.504
- Mm-hmm, yes.
The assholes were out.

12:52.506 --> 12:55.573
(laughs) I took
the whole family to Key West.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.275
- Isn't that
the gayest place on Earth?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.477
- I got to learn a lot
about the Key West culture.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.813
- Like what?
- They love AIDS.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.248
- Wha--wha--what?

13:03.250 --> 13:06.451
- Lemonades, limeades,
orangeades.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.453
- Hearing aids?
- Of course.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.555
- Oh, okay.
- Maybe.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.257
- It's a risk.
- It is.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.858
There was a lot of crassness
going on here.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.560
- Yeah, I think
you should lean into

13:15.562 --> 13:16.594
the socialite thing
a little bit more.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.697
- Because if it's
the same note over and over

13:19.699 --> 13:21.800
of how can I
gross you out...

13:23.236 --> 13:24.936
- Okay. Choices.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.771
I've got a lot
on the line here.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.840
I don't want my failure
on Snatch Game

13:28.842 --> 13:32.544
to be my defining moment
in this competition.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.913
So we really have
to work this one out.

13:35.382 --> 13:38.316
- Girl, it's nothin' on,
goin' on out here, honey.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.351
- I'm so glad that I got
to you in time, though.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.620
- Girl, in time for what?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.422
- Oh, mama, did you forget?

13:44.424 --> 13:45.290
I have the audition today.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.659
I'm planning on leaving
this life behind me.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.327
- You should let me do
your makeup.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.562
- You'd do that for me?

13:50.564 --> 13:52.230
- Time out.
So that's great.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.465
- Okay.
- But you gotta make it funny.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.035
- Okay.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.070
- Let's just go with it.
- I can't go with it

13:59.072 --> 14:01.840
if I don't know where I'm going.
Um, okay.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.675
- Let's go with the original.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.343
- Whatever you say.
- Okay.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.212
How's that singing career
going?

14:07.214 --> 14:10.215
- (off-key) Mi, mi.

14:10.217 --> 14:14.786
¶ Jumping from car to car ¶

14:14.788 --> 14:16.254
- Whoa, whoa.
I think I got something.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.021
- Oh, what's this?

14:17.023 --> 14:20.692
- It's a key since
you can't seem to find one.

14:20.694 --> 14:21.826
- Oh.
- All right.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.461
That's good.
That's a joke.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.263
Oh, my God,
you need jokes.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.699
- I'm not Bianca del Rio,
you know.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.101
This stuff just doesn't
come out of my mouth.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.102
Somebody's gonna be leaving

14:31.104 --> 14:33.037
and somebody's
gonna be returning.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.873
There's a lot
of pressure now.

14:38.211 --> 14:38.676
Okay.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.479
- I could tell Phi Phi
ain't all there right now.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.081
And I think that fight
with Alyssa

14:43.083 --> 14:45.617
is still on Phi Phi's mind.

14:45.619 --> 14:46.551
Let it go.

14:46.553 --> 14:50.054
- Can we talk?
- Mm-hmm.

14:50.056 --> 14:50.922
- Like, what I said
last week,

14:50.924 --> 14:52.957
it was just how I was
feeling in that moment.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.259
- The only thing
that bothered me is, like,

14:54.261 --> 14:59.197
I've never been one to like
throw people under the bus.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.965
When, in fact,
people in your season,

15:00.967 --> 15:03.167
that's exactly what they said
you did the whole season.

15:03.169 --> 15:07.071
- No, actually, if you ask
everybody and they admit it,

15:07.073 --> 15:09.307
even Alaska, that Sharon
threw me under the bus.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.409
I didn't throw anybody
under the bus.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.310
- Here's my thing.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.946
If someone's gonna own up
to being the bitch role,

15:14.948 --> 15:16.114
just be unapologetic.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.582
- But that's not what
my intentions were.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.716
- But you were
the name-caller.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.751
You called me a victim.

15:19.753 --> 15:20.952
- Okay.
Well, from my side,

15:20.954 --> 15:21.786
that's what it looked like.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.155
And you know what, the costume
thing, let's be real.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.057
Have they not said
already before,

15:26.059 --> 15:27.058
like, it's okay
'cause it's you.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.193
You can fart on stage and
they're just gonna be like,

15:29.195 --> 15:30.895
oh, it's okay, it's you.

15:31.498 --> 15:32.697
- But let's be real.

15:32.699 --> 15:33.631
We all got different drags.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.066
Alaska's drag
wouldn't look good on me.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.601
- I'm not saying that,
but--

15:36.603 --> 15:37.568
- Your drag
wouldn't look good on me.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.170
- I feel like my words
are getting twisted.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.338
- No, I didn't--
- That's not what I mean.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.641
- I think Phi Phi
is so talented,

15:43.643 --> 15:46.210
but she is spending
so much time

15:46.212 --> 15:47.712
second-guessing
everything she does.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.281
Is it gonna be liked?
Is the fans gonna receive it?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.883
Is she getting
a redemption story?

15:51.885 --> 15:54.285
Girl, breathe and let it go,

15:54.287 --> 15:55.920
because all that matters

15:55.922 --> 15:59.557
is you just being you
and showing your creativity.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.292
Look,
we can squash it, girl.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.927
I love what you do,
so I'm like,

16:02.929 --> 16:06.064
I don't want to sit there
and fight with you.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.499
- Done.
Now give me a hug.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.301
This is stupid
and I'm glad it's squashed

16:10.303 --> 16:12.303
and I'm glad
that we were able to find,

16:12.305 --> 16:13.972
like, this happy medium.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.507
Like, we can agree
to disagree.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.277
Now get away
from my station.

16:19.279 --> 16:19.711
(laughs)

16:19.713 --> 16:23.848
- That was just like Obama
hugging Donald Trump.

16:23.850 --> 16:27.018
Uh-uh. I ain't buying it.

16:27.721 --> 16:28.453
- Coming up...

16:28.455 --> 16:29.921
- This one right here
has more fish

16:29.923 --> 16:31.956
than an all-you-can-eat
seafood buffet.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.925
- I'm sure you know
all about the buffet,

16:33.927 --> 16:37.762
you know,
because you're fat.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.098
(RuPaul laughs)

16:41.001 --> 16:43.901
(RuPaul laughs)

16:46.106 --> 16:50.641
- ¶ Cover girl, put the bass
in your walk ¶

16:53.613 --> 16:57.281
¶ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ¶

16:57.283 --> 17:01.452
¶ Head to toe,
let your whole body talk ¶

17:01.454 --> 17:03.254
¶ Cover girl ¶

17:03.256 --> 17:05.356
- Whoo!

17:05.358 --> 17:06.724
(applause)

17:06.726 --> 17:07.925
- Welcome to the main stage

17:07.927 --> 17:10.661
of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars."

17:10.663 --> 17:14.665
And tonight, the whole family
is back together.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.702
This week,
we challenged our AllStars

17:17.704 --> 17:22.040
to perform standup comedy
in front of an audience

17:22.042 --> 17:26.544
overflowing
with Drag Race royalty.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.479
And, tonight,
the returning queens

17:28.481 --> 17:33.718
have a chance to earn their way
back into the competition.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.521
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

17:36.523 --> 17:39.223
and may the best woman win.

17:39.225 --> 17:43.194
(cheers and applause)

17:48.301 --> 17:50.068
- Hi, everybody!

17:50.070 --> 17:52.837
Well, I'm gonna be
your hostess and emcee.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.073
I'm just gonna start off
with saying I'm sorry.

17:55.075 --> 17:58.643
So how many of y'all
saw season 5?

17:58.645 --> 17:59.744
Season 5
"RuPaul's Drag Race?"

17:59.746 --> 18:02.947
(cheer and applause)
You saw the roast?

18:02.949 --> 18:03.514
Yeah, I sucked.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.882
I sucked more than Michelle
Visage at a truck stop

18:04.884 --> 18:07.919
with a roll--with a--
with a glory hole, right?

18:08.455 --> 18:11.389
So listen, I'm here to,
you know, just struggling.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.291
Another thing I struggle with
is my weight.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.326
Anybody struggle
with weight?

18:15.328 --> 18:15.993
- Whoo!

18:15.995 --> 18:17.662
- Yeah, girl, I mean,
I just don't know

18:17.664 --> 18:19.764
how to get rid
of those extra pounds.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.731
And these damn airports.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.700
You know, the bags
can only be 50 pounds,

18:22.702 --> 18:27.038
and it costs a lot of money
to looks this cheap, you know.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.573
But I'm so excited.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.808
Are y'all ready
for some real comedy?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.343
- Yeah!
(cheers and applause)

18:32.345 --> 18:35.413
- 'Cause I'm dying up here,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.682
Now, I'm not the funniest.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.717
(all laugh)

18:39.719 --> 18:41.252
- You killed that one, sis.

18:41.254 --> 18:44.722
- First up out of the gate,
besides myself,

18:44.724 --> 18:45.590
is these two girls.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.559
One thing that they do love
is the color orange.

18:48.561 --> 18:53.164
Coco Montrese
and Phi Phi O'Hara!

18:53.166 --> 18:54.832
(cheers and applause)

18:54.834 --> 18:57.735
- Whoo. Hey, daddy.

18:57.737 --> 19:01.639
- Oh, my God, coquita!
There you are!

19:01.641 --> 19:04.542
How's everything out here
on the strip tonight?

19:04.544 --> 19:06.711
- Oh, girl, it ain't goin'
too good, honey.

19:06.713 --> 19:10.414
The last John I sat on,
whoo, I had Mexican food.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.250
It wasn't that good.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.317
- Oh, man,
I'm so sorry to hear that.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.586
But I have a little favor
to ask of you.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.487
- What you want, girl?

19:16.489 --> 19:17.688
- Think you could do
my makeup?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.023
- Sit down.
I got my good stuff.

19:19.025 --> 19:19.957
- Oh, my God,
I'm so excited.

19:19.959 --> 19:23.194
You know, every time I'm on like
your social medias and stuff...

19:23.196 --> 19:23.761
- Mm-hmm.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.530
- I'm always looking
at your pictures

19:25.532 --> 19:28.399
and I'm like, oh, my God,
no filters.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.066
- Mm-hmm.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.536
- Okay, well, first tell me,
what is the first step

19:31.538 --> 19:34.405
in this, you know,
coquita makeup tutorial?

19:34.407 --> 19:37.675
- First, you gotta take that bag
of cheesy chips, girl.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.910
- Okay, okay.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.845
- Crush it up real good.

19:40.847 --> 19:41.646
- Okay, okay.

19:41.648 --> 19:46.450
- Then you gotta--you--you gotta
just take it and beat that face.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.252
I mean, girl,
you got to beat it.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.488
Beat it
like you stole something.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.790
Girl, what's this audition
for anyway?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.725
- Oh, well, I'm gonna be
an actress.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.627
- Girl, I hope it's not
a musical.

19:56.629 --> 20:00.131
You know, any instrument
you play, you gotta blow.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.599
- Oh, that's not true, mama.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.367
I've been writing
a lot of stuff.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.337
(off-key)
¶ Jump in a car ¶

20:06.339 --> 20:07.171
¶ And jump out ¶

20:07.173 --> 20:10.174
¶ The cops will come and put
their hands on the hood ¶

20:10.176 --> 20:12.510
- Oh, oh, oh, girl,
hold on, hold on.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.678
Hold on, girl.
I got something for you.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.746
- What's this?
- I got you a key.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.347
- A key?

20:16.349 --> 20:19.650
- 'Cause you can't seem
to find one, girl.

20:19.652 --> 20:23.921
- Coco and Phi Phi are not
so much doing a comedy routine,

20:23.923 --> 20:27.758
but a live-action
off, off, off, off Broadway

20:27.760 --> 20:30.595
theater production
of Hookers at the Point.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.495
- Coming up...

20:31.497 --> 20:35.199
- Alyssa, describe
Michelle Visage in one word.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.467
Go.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.636
- Beast!

20:38.638 --> 20:41.906
(silence)

20:41.908 --> 20:44.242
(RuPaul laughs)

20:45.144 --> 20:48.846
(RuPaul laughs)

20:48.848 --> 20:50.081
- Hey there.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.451
What seems to be going on?

20:53.453 --> 20:54.352
- (laughs)

20:54.354 --> 20:56.220
- So Roxxxy
was bombing up here,

20:56.222 --> 20:57.288
so yeah, she asked me
to come

20:57.290 --> 20:58.256
and finish the show for her.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.391
You don't want to see
any more of her, right?

21:00.393 --> 21:01.959
My name is Tosha Salad.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.161
I was on Season 5
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

21:04.163 --> 21:07.298
Do you remember?
I am so excited to be here.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.134
I just got off
the best Italian vacation.

21:10.136 --> 21:13.371
I was over in the beautiful
Thousand Island

21:13.373 --> 21:15.473
on a beautiful ranch.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.874
And let me tell you,

21:16.876 --> 21:18.976
I flew in just to try
and save her ass.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.444
Are you ready
for some more comedy?

21:20.446 --> 21:22.813
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready?

21:22.815 --> 21:23.648
Ladies and gentleman,

21:23.650 --> 21:27.652
she is the blue cheese
to the other one's crumbles.

21:27.654 --> 21:28.286
Make some noise.

21:28.288 --> 21:32.723
This is Alyssa Edwards
and Alaska!

21:32.725 --> 21:37.094
(cheers and applause)

21:37.096 --> 21:40.131
- My name is Alaska,
just like the state.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.532
- My name is Alyssa Edwards,

21:41.534 --> 21:47.471
and this definitely
ain't nobody's secret

21:47.473 --> 21:50.641
that this gigarama
is completely full

21:50.643 --> 21:58.482
of buffoonery, wiggery
and straight-up tomfoolery.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.584
(laughter)

22:00.586 --> 22:02.887
- Totally.

22:02.889 --> 22:03.654
(laughter)

22:03.656 --> 22:09.460
Alyssa, we're in the company
of some amazing queens tonight.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.761
- Where?

22:10.763 --> 22:13.798
(laughter)

22:13.800 --> 22:16.567
- Ouch.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.869
Detox and Tatianna are here.

22:18.871 --> 22:22.673
- The Hills Have Eyes,
part 2, the remix.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.611
- Bam.

22:29.215 --> 22:34.218
Alyssa, describe Michelle Visage
in one word. Go.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.654
- Beast.

22:36.656 --> 22:39.623
(laughter)

22:43.863 --> 22:44.995
- Burn.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.865
(laughter)

22:47.867 --> 22:50.000
Alyssa, I want to thank you
so much

22:50.002 --> 22:51.235
for being
my partner tonight.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.904
Don't worry.
If drag doesn't work out,

22:53.906 --> 22:57.641
you'll always have
something to fall back on.

22:57.643 --> 22:58.776
Your back rolls.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.979
(cheers and applause)

23:03.983 --> 23:07.251
- These next two girls, let me
tell you, they are so nutty.

23:07.253 --> 23:08.953
Besides Wal-marts--
walnuts and almonds,

23:08.955 --> 23:10.955
these are my favorite nuts,
ladies and gentlemen.

23:10.957 --> 23:16.494
Make some noise. This is
Ginger Minj and Katya.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.363
(cheers and applause )

23:19.365 --> 23:21.432
- Hello.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.067
It's not the first time
she's gotten clap

23:23.069 --> 23:25.669
from a room full of people.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.705
Well, hey, y'all,
how are you?

23:27.707 --> 23:29.874
You know, I'm so excited
to be here tonight

23:29.876 --> 23:34.245
sharing this stage
with my BFF Katya.

23:34.247 --> 23:34.912
(cheers and applause )

23:34.914 --> 23:36.947
Now, I know most of you
might be sitting out there

23:36.949 --> 23:40.117
asking yourself, self--
that's what you say.

23:40.119 --> 23:44.455
You say, self, now how does
a delicate, petite,

23:44.457 --> 23:46.056
little cross-dresser
for Christ

23:46.058 --> 23:47.091
become best friends

23:47.093 --> 23:51.128
with a disease-riddled,
low-rent Russian whore?

23:51.130 --> 23:54.432
- You see, I spend most
of my time on my back,

23:54.434 --> 23:58.068
while she tries to find
someone to shave hers.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.672
- It's funny
'cause it's true.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.840
Seriously,
this one right here

24:02.842 --> 24:06.944
has more fish than an
all-you-can-eat seafood buffet.

24:06.946 --> 24:07.711
- That's funny, Ginger.

24:07.713 --> 24:10.214
I'm sure you know all about
the buffet, you know,

24:10.216 --> 24:12.883
because you're fat.

24:12.885 --> 24:13.384
- Shut up!

24:13.386 --> 24:16.620
I will turn you into
immigration, Balki, all right?

24:16.622 --> 24:19.790
- But through it all,
we have plunged head first

24:19.792 --> 24:21.759
into the most beautiful
friendship,

24:21.761 --> 24:23.961
and we have never
looked back.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.663
Mostly because
she doesn't have a neck

24:25.665 --> 24:27.364
and she can't really
turn her head.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.200
Thank you all so much.
Good night.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.067
- No, bitch, get back here.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.736
I got asthma,
but I will catch you!

24:33.806 --> 24:37.141
- Ladies and gentlemen, do I
look a little slimmer to you,

24:37.143 --> 24:38.776
like I lost some weight?

24:38.778 --> 24:40.211
Do you want to know
my secret?

24:40.213 --> 24:43.547
I started using
light dressing.

24:43.549 --> 24:44.548
Get it?

24:44.550 --> 24:46.717
- We got it, girl.

24:46.719 --> 24:47.618
We got it.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.187
- Okay. Next up, well,
one of these girls,

24:50.189 --> 24:54.525
she is so fishy, she is
the sardines in Caesar dressing.

24:54.527 --> 24:58.562
The other girl prefers
uncut carrots in her salad.

24:58.564 --> 25:02.600
Make some noise.
This is Detox and Tatianna!

25:02.602 --> 25:04.101
(cheers and applause)

25:04.103 --> 25:05.936
- Well, hey, hey.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.371
- Hello, hello.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.907
My name is Lady Ladybits.

25:09.909 --> 25:10.975
- And I'm Beatrice Backdoor.

25:10.977 --> 25:14.445
Thank y'all so much for coming
to tonight's event.

25:14.447 --> 25:17.348
It's a benefit for babies
battling bulimia.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.518
- And I already see
there's a bevy

25:20.520 --> 25:22.019
of beautiful bitter bitches

25:22.021 --> 25:24.054
already here
hitting the buffet.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.422
Bea and I met last year

25:25.424 --> 25:29.193
at Patty's Pooches
with Prolapse Garden Party.

25:29.195 --> 25:29.927
We did.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.096
- The rosebuds
were in full bloom.

25:32.098 --> 25:35.366
- We were out, literally.

25:35.368 --> 25:38.068
Especially this one's date.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.104
- Date? I came alone.

25:40.106 --> 25:43.340
- You came with
Carlos the gardener.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.376
- When?
- Well, what?

25:45.378 --> 25:48.279
You were blowing
saliva water balloons.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.115
I know you guys are here

25:51.117 --> 25:52.483
giving your time
and your money

25:52.485 --> 25:55.185
to this lovely benefit for
teeny tiny, teeny tiny tots.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.021
But I just want to know
when you're gonna have

25:57.023 --> 25:59.356
some teeny, tiny tots
of your own there, Bea.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.457
- I've always wanted some.

26:00.459 --> 26:02.459
My doctor keeps telling me
that my testi--

26:02.461 --> 26:05.829
that my ovaries
are just getting in the way.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.766
You know, I've always wanted
to tell you something.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.902
There's a secret behind the
woman that you see here today.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.104
- Oh, no, is there really?

26:14.106 --> 26:15.272
- Oh, this is hard for me.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.373
- It's okay, dear,
spit it out.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.474
No matter what
you're about to tell me,

26:17.476 --> 26:21.078
you will always be in my eyes
by best girlfriend.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.215
- You see... (lower voice)
I used to have braces.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.151
- Oh! Bea!

26:27.153 --> 26:28.719
You are incorrigible, Bea.

26:28.721 --> 26:31.655
We'll see you next year.
Oh, ho, no!

26:31.657 --> 26:34.959
That Sally Field, that cunt
lied to me about the Boniva.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.226
- Come on, Boniva.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.294
(cheers and applause)

26:37.296 --> 26:39.563
- Ladies and gentleman,
did you all enjoy the show?

26:39.565 --> 26:41.198
Say yeah.
- Yeah!

26:41.200 --> 26:43.534
- We want to thank you guys
for coming out tonight.

26:43.536 --> 26:44.802
And if you can't laugh
at yourself,

26:44.804 --> 26:47.404
how in the hell are you
gonna laugh at somebody else?

26:47.406 --> 26:48.672
Can I get an amen?

26:48.674 --> 26:49.573
- Amen!
- Amen!

26:49.575 --> 26:51.342
- Thank you. Good night.

26:51.344 --> 26:52.676
- Coming up...

26:52.678 --> 26:54.912
- Your punchlines were there
and you delivered them.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.614
- I didn't want it to end.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.083
- It was work.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.418
(RuPaul laughs)

27:02.355 --> 27:04.722
(RuPaul laughs)

27:04.724 --> 27:06.256
- Welcome, AllStars.

27:06.258 --> 27:09.159
It's time for
the judges' critiques

27:09.161 --> 27:12.596
starting with
Roxxxy Andrews.

27:12.598 --> 27:15.366
- During the show, I thought
your entrance was strong

27:15.368 --> 27:17.401
and then it was like someone
took the needle off the record.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.536
- With a roll--with a--
with a glory hole, right?

27:19.538 --> 27:21.905
- And some of the jokes
just didn't land.

27:21.907 --> 27:24.775
- Then you enlisted the help
of Tosha Salad,

27:24.777 --> 27:25.609
which you get kudos for,

27:25.611 --> 27:27.344
but you were the only one
who was solo.

27:27.346 --> 27:30.280
You really could've stolen
the show from everybody.

27:30.282 --> 27:34.351
- Up next, Coco Montrese
and Phi Phi O'Hara.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.420
- Coco, I think your makeup
looks fantastic.

27:36.422 --> 27:40.391
- And Phi Phi, I'd turn up for
anybody with a Shanaynay nail.

27:40.393 --> 27:41.458
(all laugh)

27:41.460 --> 27:44.795
- I will say you had
some funny jokes in there,

27:44.797 --> 27:47.598
but for me, it turned into,
like, a scene study

27:47.600 --> 27:49.767
instead of
a comedy routine.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.168
- Yeah, we wanted to go
a different route,

27:51.170 --> 27:54.438
like that "SNL" skit type of
thing instead of just standup.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.306
- I get it,
but it turned into

27:56.308 --> 27:58.809
more of like
an Afterschool Special.

27:58.811 --> 27:59.977
- Hmm, okay.

27:59.979 --> 28:04.114
- Up next, Alyssa Edwards
and Alaska.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.282
- I thought the two of you

28:05.284 --> 28:07.651
probably worked together
the best as a team.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.586
Alyssa, you are comedy gold.

28:09.588 --> 28:13.390
All you have to do is go...
and purse your lips

28:13.392 --> 28:14.391
and I'm entertained.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.759
- And Alaska, smartly,

28:15.761 --> 28:18.629
I think you didn't let
Alyssa steal the show.

28:18.631 --> 28:19.563
You know, you had me trained

28:19.565 --> 28:21.865
to look back to you
for that zinger.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.168
I mean, this is a show
I would've paid to see.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.837
- Up next, Ginger Minj
and Katya.

28:26.839 --> 28:30.541
- I liked your relationship
as partners.

28:30.543 --> 28:31.675
You had some good zingers.

28:31.677 --> 28:32.743
- But I think
you were so focused

28:32.745 --> 28:33.744
on the competition
part of it,

28:33.746 --> 28:36.180
I wish I would've seen
a little more joy.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.881
Just...it was work.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.351
- Katya, this jacket
is giving me everything

28:41.353 --> 28:43.320
that I could possibly need
from 1983.

28:43.322 --> 28:46.223
- It's giving me shingles.
(all laugh)

28:46.225 --> 28:47.558
- But there's no relationship
between the two of you.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.527
Even if there would've been
one piece of teal on Katya

28:50.529 --> 28:52.229
or one piece of black
on Ginger,

28:52.231 --> 28:54.565
something to sort of say,
like, hey, we're a team.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.534
- Up next,
Tatianna and Detox.

28:57.536 --> 28:58.502
- I would like to start
by saying

28:58.504 --> 29:01.872
you made my face hurt
from laughing and smiling,

29:01.874 --> 29:02.539
and that is a feat

29:02.541 --> 29:04.842
because I haven't felt
anything on my face in years.

29:04.844 --> 29:10.047
Tatianna, you gave us that ditzy
Stepford Wife fundraiser,

29:10.049 --> 29:10.748
which I loved.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.817
- And De, the character
of Lydia is so funny

29:13.819 --> 29:15.285
and you had so many jokes,

29:15.287 --> 29:16.420
but you almost
couldn't hear them

29:16.422 --> 29:18.322
because of the accent
you were putting on.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.790
- But your punchlines
were there.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.692
You believed them
and you delivered them.

29:21.694 --> 29:24.528
- The material,
the delivery, the wardrobe,

29:24.530 --> 29:26.296
I didn't want it to end.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.364
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.399
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

29:29.401 --> 29:34.972
Based on the judges critiques,
I've made some decisions.

29:35.975 --> 29:39.409
Alyssa Edwards and Alaska,

29:39.411 --> 29:41.745
Tatianna and Detox,

29:41.747 --> 29:46.049
you are the top AllStars
of the week.

29:46.051 --> 29:46.817
(applause)

29:46.819 --> 29:51.655
You've each won a couture gown
from S&L Designs,

29:51.657 --> 29:56.860
designed by Sasha Lauren
valued at $2,000.

29:58.764 --> 30:02.199
Katya, you are safe.

30:03.269 --> 30:08.305
That means Roxxxy Andrews
and Phi Phi O'Hara,

30:08.307 --> 30:12.709
you are the bottom two
of the week.

30:13.813 --> 30:17.181
Ginger Minj, Coco Montrese,

30:17.183 --> 30:20.784
I'm afraid we must
say goodbye once again.

30:20.786 --> 30:21.952
- When it hits me

30:21.954 --> 30:26.824
that I do not get to come back
to the competition, it hurts.

30:26.826 --> 30:29.159
It's not an easy pill
to swallow

30:29.161 --> 30:31.895
to be told thanks,
you did a great job.

30:31.897 --> 30:33.931
Now go home again.

30:33.933 --> 30:39.436
- Alyssa and Tatianna,
as the returning queens,

30:39.438 --> 30:41.438
you'll lip sync for $10,000,

30:41.440 --> 30:45.209
the power to eliminate
one of the bottom queens,

30:45.211 --> 30:49.179
and the right to return
to the competition.

30:49.582 --> 30:54.351
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

30:54.353 --> 30:58.422
the judges and I
will do some scrapbooking.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.857
Thank you, ladies.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.559
You may leave the stage.

31:03.796 --> 31:06.930
- So, girl, why don't you
go ahead and sell yourself.

31:06.932 --> 31:08.465
- I don't want
to sell myself.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.333
I really respect
the both of you,

31:09.335 --> 31:12.102
and if you win the lip sync,
choose how you feel fit.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.504
And if you win the lip sync,
choose how you feel fit.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.340
- Yeah. You'd rather have
your work speak for you.

31:16.342 --> 31:19.109
- I respect that.
I'm just saying, I'm gonna beg.

31:19.111 --> 31:22.579
I am not too proud to beg
for $100,000.

31:22.581 --> 31:23.347
I'm not that girl.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.248
- Okay.
Well, you know what?

31:24.250 --> 31:26.984
The girl that I am
is not gonna beg somebody.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.854
- I don't really get
why explaining to someone

31:30.856 --> 31:32.923
why you should stay
in this competition

31:32.925 --> 31:34.658
would be considered begging.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.194
You gotta let a bitch
know why you should stay.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.329
That's completely ego
talking.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.864
- Everybody knows,
obviously,

31:40.866 --> 31:43.433
I'll say whatever the fuck
I want to say.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.167
- You do, yeah.

31:44.169 --> 31:45.936
- And my real feelings
is I don't--

31:45.938 --> 31:47.638
I don't feel I need to beg.

31:48.073 --> 31:48.972
- I'm gonna be honest
with you.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.941
To me, if I was a fan,
you know what I would say?

31:50.943 --> 31:52.509
Is she fuckin
in it to win it?

31:52.511 --> 31:54.344
- If that's what
you're questioning, bitch,

31:54.346 --> 31:55.145
I want to be here.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.047
I don't feel I need
to kiss anybody's butt

31:57.049 --> 31:59.683
to stay here because
if you look me in the eyes,

31:59.685 --> 32:00.450
you would see that I have

32:00.452 --> 32:04.087
fire and passion
for this competition.

32:04.089 --> 32:04.922
- I want to tell you,
though,

32:04.924 --> 32:07.291
I know last week we were
heated with each other.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.026
- Yeah.
- I celebrate what you do.

32:09.028 --> 32:09.526
- Thank you.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.595
- And I wish you luck, girl.
May the best woman win.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.231
- True.
- Like Ru said, you know, no T.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.232
- Okay.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.167
- I'm not holding a grudge
against Phi Phi

32:17.169 --> 32:17.901
when I'm deliberating.

32:17.903 --> 32:20.237
I'm definitely gonna take
into consideration

32:20.239 --> 32:22.272
the consistency level,
the critiques,

32:22.274 --> 32:23.941
and how well
they sell theirself to me.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.509
Girl, I'm gonna keep it real
with you.

32:25.511 --> 32:29.479
Last night, when I walked from
that door to get that trophy,

32:29.481 --> 32:31.081
I didn't come here
for that trophy.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.950
You didn't either.

32:35.788 --> 32:38.755
Roxxxy, girl,
you can set over there

32:38.757 --> 32:39.756
and own that to this group.

32:39.758 --> 32:43.760
Just let's all stand up
and fight for it

32:43.762 --> 32:45.429
and say, I want to be here.

32:45.431 --> 32:45.963
- I do.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.798
- Do you want to be here,
Roxxxy, in the top three?

32:47.800 --> 32:50.801
- More than anything I can ever
explain to you right now.

32:50.803 --> 32:52.636
- Then I'm gonna
keep it real with you.

32:52.638 --> 32:53.437
You had the hardest job.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.905
You didn't even have
a second opinion

32:54.907 --> 32:57.341
to ask is this a good act.

32:58.911 --> 32:59.943
Here's the thing.

32:59.945 --> 33:01.478
They've both
been in the bottom.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.245
They've both won.

33:02.247 --> 33:05.148
Roxxxy's also won
one of the lip syncs.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.950
It's hard making
this deliberation.

33:06.952 --> 33:09.186
I have a connection
with both these two gals,

33:09.188 --> 33:10.921
and we've shared
this experience.

33:10.923 --> 33:13.256
We've traveled together,
we've performed together.

33:13.258 --> 33:16.159
But I understand
the responsibility

33:16.161 --> 33:17.995
of this competition.

33:19.898 --> 33:20.630
- So how's it going?

33:20.632 --> 33:22.632
How are you feeling?
- You know what?

33:22.634 --> 33:24.001
Alyssa and I had a talk,

33:24.003 --> 33:25.702
and she was like,
do you want to be here?

33:25.704 --> 33:26.803
And I was like, yes,
of course.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.038
Obviously I fuckin
want to be here.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.473
At the same time, like,
I don't want to beg.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.641
I was only in the bottom once,
and every week,

33:31.643 --> 33:33.643
I've been getting better
and better and better

33:33.645 --> 33:34.311
and I won last week.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.713
I think, honestly,
I fuckin killed it tonight.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.715
So I was like, all right,
we did it.

33:38.717 --> 33:39.783
- Yeah.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.051
- Well, I'm glad
you're in the top again.

33:41.053 --> 33:41.952
You guys
were funny up there.

33:41.954 --> 33:44.154
I was worried about
the Detox thing.

33:44.590 --> 33:45.689
I'm gonna be honest
with you.

33:45.691 --> 33:46.456
It was really hard to hear

33:46.458 --> 33:48.158
what Detox was saying
with the accent.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.827
- Well, what are you
trying to do there, girl?

33:50.829 --> 33:51.762
It was really good,

33:51.764 --> 33:55.332
but, like, you couldn't hear
anything that Detox was saying.

33:55.334 --> 33:58.001
But she told Detox
you were funny,

33:58.003 --> 34:00.504
but Tatianna
wasn't very funny.

34:00.506 --> 34:01.371
Ooh, bitch.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.975
Phi Phi is playing
a little motherfucking game.

34:04.977 --> 34:06.043
- You better be changing.

34:06.045 --> 34:06.943
- Oh, I will.
- Yeah.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.612
- Trust and believe.
- Do it.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.048
- Hey, I totally enjoy
Phi Phi.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.250
She's become
a really good friend.

34:13.252 --> 34:17.587
But if you're gonna play a game,
girl, play it right.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.424
- These pinking shears
are amazing.

34:20.426 --> 34:21.625
- Oh, my God,
that's gorgeous.

34:21.627 --> 34:25.495
- Does anybody have
another furry ball?

34:25.497 --> 34:27.397
- Not one that I can detach.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.765
- Eew.

34:28.767 --> 34:29.866
- Silence!

34:29.868 --> 34:32.602
Bring back my girls.

34:36.608 --> 34:37.808
- I'm real close
to just pulling

34:37.810 --> 34:40.977
an eeny, meeny, miney, moe,
to be honest with you.

34:42.381 --> 34:48.485
It really ended up being
a neck and neck decision for me.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.390
- I done weighed it all out

34:53.392 --> 34:54.958
and I know the decision
I'm gonna make

34:54.960 --> 34:57.294
and I'm gonna say bye.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.600
(RuPaul laughs)

35:04.436 --> 35:07.270
(RuPaul laughs)

35:10.809 --> 35:12.442
- Welcome back, ladies.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.712
Two top AllStars
stand before me.

35:15.714 --> 35:21.985
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me, win $10,000,

35:21.987 --> 35:29.259
and the power to give one of
the bottom queens the chop.

35:29.661 --> 35:33.964
But most importantly,
the winner will earn the right

35:33.966 --> 35:37.767
to return
to the competition.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.103
The time has come

35:40.105 --> 35:44.307
for you to not only
lip sync for your legacy,

35:44.309 --> 35:51.882
but to lip sync for your
(echoing) life.

35:51.884 --> 35:54.651
God, I love saying that.

35:55.187 --> 35:59.723
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

35:59.725 --> 36:04.461
- ¶ I've been looking for
a driver who's qualified ¶

36:04.463 --> 36:06.596
¶ So if you think
that you're the one ¶

36:06.598 --> 36:08.265
¶ Step into my ride ¶

36:08.267 --> 36:11.835
¶ I'm a fine-tuned
supersonic speed machine ¶

36:11.837 --> 36:15.539
¶ With a sunroof top
and a gangster lean ¶

36:15.541 --> 36:19.643
¶ My engine's ready
to explode, explode, explode ¶

36:19.645 --> 36:23.213
¶ So start me up
and watch me go, go, go, go ¶

36:23.215 --> 36:25.115
¶ Get you where
you wanna go ¶

36:25.117 --> 36:26.216
¶ If you know what I mean ¶

36:26.218 --> 36:29.986
¶ Got a ride that's smoother
than a limousine ¶

36:29.988 --> 36:32.122
¶ Can you handle
the curves? ¶

36:32.124 --> 36:33.490
¶ Can you run
all the lights? ¶

36:33.492 --> 36:37.160
¶ If you can, baby boy,
then we can go all night ¶

36:37.162 --> 36:41.064
¶ 'Cause I'm zero to 60
in 3.5 ¶

36:41.066 --> 36:43.366
¶ Baby, you got the keys ¶

36:43.368 --> 36:47.737
¶ Now shut up and drive,
drive, drive, drive ¶

36:47.739 --> 36:50.073
¶ 'Cause
you play that game ¶

36:50.075 --> 36:51.308
¶ Got what I got ¶

36:51.310 --> 36:54.844
¶ Baby, don't stop,
it's a sure shot ¶

36:54.846 --> 36:58.815
¶ So step inside
and ride, ride, ride, ride ¶

36:58.817 --> 37:00.317
¶ Ride, ride, ride, ride ¶

37:00.319 --> 37:02.152
¶ Ride, ride, ride, ride ¶

37:02.154 --> 37:04.254
¶ Ride, ride, ride, ride,
ride, ride ¶

37:04.256 --> 37:08.258
¶ So start me up
and watch me go, go, go, go ¶

37:08.260 --> 37:09.993
¶ Get you where
you wanna go ¶

37:09.995 --> 37:10.961
¶ If you know what I mean ¶

37:10.963 --> 37:14.965
¶ Got a ride that's smoother
than a limousine ¶

37:14.967 --> 37:19.002
¶ 'Cause I'm zero to 60
in 3.5 ¶

37:19.004 --> 37:21.671
¶ Baby, you got the keys ¶

37:21.673 --> 37:25.075
¶ Now shut up and drive,
drive, drive, drive ¶

37:25.077 --> 37:29.212
¶ Shut up and drive,
drive, drive, drive ¶

37:29.214 --> 37:33.383
¶ Shut up and drive,
drive, drive, drive ¶

37:35.654 --> 37:39.055
(applause)

37:41.526 --> 37:45.695
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.

37:47.332 --> 37:49.699
Tatianna...

37:49.701 --> 37:51.935
you're a winner, baby.

37:54.206 --> 37:56.906
- All those good feelings.
I'm feeling all of those.

38:02.814 --> 38:10.520
- And Alyssa Edwards,
you are also a winner, baby.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.924
- What?

38:16.328 --> 38:17.460
- Con-drag-ulations.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.629
You are both back
in the competition.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.431
- Oh, my God.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.098
- What?
- Yes.

38:22.100 --> 38:26.836
- I'm giving you each
a tip of $5,000.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.038
- Thank you.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.607
- And you both
earned the power

38:30.609 --> 38:36.446
to eliminate
one of the bottom two.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.382
- So you mean to tell me

38:39.384 --> 38:41.451
if one of them's
got my lipstick

38:41.453 --> 38:44.020
and one of them's
got Phi Phi's,

38:44.022 --> 38:45.855
we're both going home?

38:47.693 --> 38:48.158
Ooh.

38:48.160 --> 38:52.329
- With great power
comes great responsibility.

38:52.331 --> 38:58.101
Alyssa, which queen have
you chosen to get the chop?

38:58.103 --> 39:04.307
- I think you're both great
entertainers and competitors.

39:04.309 --> 39:06.309
However, tonight...

39:08.380 --> 39:10.447
I chose
Phi Phi O'Hara to go home.

39:13.018 --> 39:13.550
- Tatianna.

39:13.552 --> 39:17.487
- This was a really difficult
decision to make,

39:17.489 --> 39:21.991
but with that said,
I went with...

39:23.662 --> 39:25.128
Phi Phi O'Hara.

39:25.130 --> 39:29.199
- As it is written,
so it shall be done.

39:29.201 --> 39:32.969
Phi Phi O'Hara,
you are an AllStar.

39:32.971 --> 39:36.973
Now...sashay away.

39:38.510 --> 39:39.409
- I love you.

39:39.411 --> 39:42.345
- Fuck them bitches up.
(laughs)

39:42.347 --> 39:44.814
Thank you.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.182
- That's okay. No.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.952
Bye. Love you.

39:48.954 --> 39:52.021
Mwah, mwah.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.790
Mwah.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.594
Yes. Yeah, of course, yeah.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.028
- Phi Phi,
I tried to hug you, though.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.631
- You know what, it's
always okay to make mistakes,

40:01.633 --> 40:03.433
and just know that you
can always grow from them.

40:03.435 --> 40:06.569
It's never the end.
You can always start over.

40:06.571 --> 40:07.437
Love you all.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.973
Phi Phi O'Hara,
¶ jump in a car ¶

40:09.975 --> 40:13.309
(all laugh)

40:14.880 --> 40:18.248
Honestly, I don't feel
I deserve to be eliminated.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.349
Tatianna's decision, eh.

40:19.351 --> 40:22.585
She hasn't been here, so it
doesn't really surprise me.

40:22.587 --> 40:23.787
But, Alyssa, yeah.

40:23.789 --> 40:24.788
I mean,
it's kind of hypocritical.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.690
She always tells people
it's about consistency,

40:27.692 --> 40:28.992
and then you're
gonna get rid of me

40:28.994 --> 40:30.393
when I've only been
in the bottom once,

40:30.395 --> 40:31.194
Roxxxy, three times.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.495
But you know what,
let's be real.

40:32.497 --> 40:33.930
I fucking killed it.

40:33.932 --> 40:34.497
Do I get this?

40:34.499 --> 40:35.632
Like, could I
at least sell this thing

40:35.634 --> 40:38.802
for, like, $10,000?
(scoffs)

40:42.007 --> 40:44.441
- Con-drag-ulations,
AllStars.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.843
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

40:46.845 --> 40:49.779
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

40:49.781 --> 40:51.314
Can I get an amen in here?

40:51.316 --> 40:52.482
- Amen!
- Amen!

40:52.484 --> 40:53.216
- Amen!

40:53.218 --> 40:55.318
- Now let the music play.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.487
- ¶ Throw your hands up ¶

40:57.489 --> 40:59.122
¶ Time to get down ¶

40:59.124 --> 41:00.857
¶ Time to get down ¶

41:00.859 --> 41:03.293
¶ Down, down, down, down ¶

41:03.295 --> 41:05.462
¶ Throw your hands up ¶
