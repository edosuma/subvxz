WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:10.178
BOTH:
Welcome to Woodstone B and B.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.180
(floor creaking)

00:12.213 --> 00:13.281
Babe?

00:13.314 --> 00:15.116
(yelling)

00:16.350 --> 00:20.288
Jay? Jay?

00:20.321 --> 00:22.990
That not good.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.527
SAMANTHA:
Hey, sweetie,
how are you feeling?

00:26.560 --> 00:27.928
I'm okay, it's just
that I really

00:27.961 --> 00:30.464
hit my head hard, though.
Ouch.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.266
Do you think I can see 'em?

00:32.300 --> 00:33.867
See who?
The ghosts.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.369
I mean, when you hit your head,
you could see ghosts.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.372
Are there any ghosts
in here right now?
No.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.474
Okay, well, that's probably
why I'm not seeing any.

00:40.508 --> 00:41.842
So far, so good.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.577
The dream is still alive.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.912
I'm gonna go check downstairs.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.448
You should just
stay here, get some rest.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.749
Yeah, you're right.
(doorbell rings)

00:48.782 --> 00:50.418
Thanks, babe. Love you.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.019
Love you.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.889
(door opens, shuts)

01:01.061 --> 01:02.630
Flower?

01:04.265 --> 01:05.533
Hey, Thor?

01:05.566 --> 01:09.303
Isaac?
No Pants?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.640
Oh, my God.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.942
Pete.

01:14.975 --> 01:17.745
Jay. You can see me?!

01:17.778 --> 01:21.149
Gadzooks! Jay can see us!

01:21.182 --> 01:23.317
I don't believe it.
(stammers)

01:25.586 --> 01:26.954
Bring it in, big fella.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.589
No, no, no.
(groans)

01:28.622 --> 01:30.324
(laughs)

01:30.358 --> 01:32.293
What is happening?

01:32.326 --> 01:35.263
Hey, where's your arrow?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.665
Jay, why are you hugging
the delivery guy?

01:37.698 --> 01:39.600
Huh?

01:40.668 --> 01:42.403
Damn it.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.838
*

01:49.009 --> 01:51.779
(indistinct chatter)
(Samantha clears throat)

01:51.812 --> 01:54.415
As you all know,
our first guests--

01:54.448 --> 01:55.983
not including the ones
that left

01:56.016 --> 01:58.419
after the floor collapsed--
will be arriving at any moment.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.920
Please be young and hot.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.022
And we really need
this visit to go well.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.692
After the floor thing, the last
people gave us a scathing

02:04.725 --> 02:06.360
one-star review on Yelp.

02:06.394 --> 02:09.563
Which is a website where
customers can rate and review

02:09.597 --> 02:12.400
businesses like our B and B.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.568
The fates of industry
should not be decided

02:14.602 --> 02:15.703
by commoners.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.004
Sometimes you bite
into a sausage

02:17.037 --> 02:18.739
and you get a worker's thumb.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.409
Get on with your miserable day
and let the factory owners be.

02:21.442 --> 02:24.278
The point is, we need everyone
on their best behavior.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.181
Yeah, and that means
no ghost powers. Okay?

02:27.215 --> 02:29.383
Thorfinn, no futzing
with the electricity.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.751
(grunts)
And, guys,

02:30.784 --> 02:32.019
let's just stay out
of their room. Okay?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.287
It's not a peep show.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.588
Yeah,

02:34.622 --> 02:36.590
I'm looking at you,
No Pants.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.726
No, you're not, sweetie.
Damn it.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.027
It's cute how bad
he wants it.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.429
(chuckles)
Oh, come on.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.663
Why do you care if we go
in the guests' rooms?

02:42.696 --> 02:43.797
They won't know.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.333
Yeah, we've been
spying on Livings

02:45.366 --> 02:46.700
for hundreds of years.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.836
Until TV it was our only form
of entertainment.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.371
FLOWER:
Yeah, honestly, Sam,

02:50.404 --> 02:54.041
if we can't spy, why are we even
opening this B and B?

02:54.074 --> 02:57.211
Uh, to earn money
so we can eat.

02:57.245 --> 03:00.981
Oh, someone can consume food.
Must be nice.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.554
And I'm like, that ain't a
ruler, it's a bracelet, bro.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.722
(laughs) Yes.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.791
Oh, hey, Nigel.
What are y'all watching?

03:10.824 --> 03:15.729
A historical program entitled
How About Those '90s.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.931
(laughs)
Show's so fun,

03:17.965 --> 03:20.067
doesn't even feel
like learning.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.869
MAN (on TV):
How do I get myself an intern?

03:21.902 --> 03:24.772
Well, it's getting late.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.039
What? Oh, no,
but we're still

03:26.073 --> 03:27.775
at nineteen hundred
and ninety-four.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.009
We don't even know
if that O.J. fellow

03:29.042 --> 03:30.878
tracks down the real killers.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.681
Isaac, feel free to call
on me at the shed. Adieu.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.317
How about those '90s, huh?
(laughs)

03:36.350 --> 03:38.486
Is it just me, or does he
seem rather uncomfortable

03:38.519 --> 03:40.721
hanging out here at the mansion?
I must say,

03:40.754 --> 03:42.956
he did seem in
quite a hurry to leave.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.725
Yes, I wonder if
something's wrong.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.427
Well, have you talked
to him about it?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.195
(scoffs)
No.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.598
(chuckles) That sounds like
an unpleasant conversation.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.901
Indeed. Avoid relationship
conflict at all costs.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.035
Yes.
Bottle it up.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.170
Allow the resentment to fester

03:57.204 --> 03:59.307
until the hatred becomes
so ever-present

03:59.340 --> 04:01.074
you must turn to the
sweet, sweet milk

04:01.108 --> 04:03.043
of mother morphine
to numb the pain.

04:03.076 --> 04:07.247
Yeah, a short conversation
couldn't hurt.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.050
TREVOR:
Damn, did you get
a new perfume, Sam?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.819
It is working, girl.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.953
It was my late mother's.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.855
I only have a
little bit left,

04:14.888 --> 04:16.256
so I use it sparingly

04:16.290 --> 04:18.058
whenever I want to feel her
watch over me.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.960
Thank you for the
verbal cold shower.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.462
Sam, they're here.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.863
They're here!
Okay.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.998
(doorbell rings)
Welcome. Welcome.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.001
Welcome to the Woodstone
B and B.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.703
Oh, hi there.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.104
Gosh, this is beautiful.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.773
It's like I've died
and gone to heaven.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.342
Oh, if only it were
that simple.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.345
I'm Debbie, and this
is my husband Tom.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.813
Short for Thomas,
like the English muffins.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.349
No relation.
(both laugh)

04:41.382 --> 04:42.616
These two are brutal.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.017
(laughing):
English muffins.

04:44.051 --> 04:47.321
Well, I'm Sam, and
this is my husband Jay.

04:47.355 --> 04:51.058
And these are your
signature welcome cocktails.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.026
TOM:
Thank you very much.
Mm-hmm.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.695
Wow, that hits the spot.

04:54.728 --> 04:55.829
Very nice.
Mmm. Yummy.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.764
(laughs)
Bingo.
Mm-hmm.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.765
Well, I think you'll find

04:57.798 --> 04:58.999
that is just one of the many

04:59.032 --> 05:00.701
special touches that
sets Woodstone apart

05:00.734 --> 05:02.102
from the B and B herd.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.505
Oof.
Yeah, that was hard
to watch.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.440
I'll just, uh, show you
to your rooms.
Okay. Thank you.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.241
Okay.
Yep.
Enjoy your stay.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.143
Thanks a lot.
Right this way.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.879
DEBBIE:
Okay, right behind you.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.948
Well, they seem happy.
Lame but happy.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.750
(chuckles) Yeah,
I think that went really well.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.185
I'm not so sure, Sam.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.953
Let me tell you something
about your polite

05:19.987 --> 05:21.188
Midwesterners there.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.823
They can be very tricky.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.225
And this is 18 years in the
travel agency game talking.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.259
What are you talking about?

05:26.293 --> 05:27.495
They loved the house.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.996
They loved the cocktails.
But did they?

05:29.029 --> 05:32.966
They left them barely
touched right there.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.135
That's true.
Not even a second sip.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.438
This type of customer,
they're all smiles,

05:37.471 --> 05:39.239
but you never know what
they're really thinking.

05:39.272 --> 05:41.074
So you're saying they
kvell to your face

05:41.108 --> 05:42.676
but kvetch behind your back?

05:42.710 --> 05:45.679
Possibly. Based on
context clues, I think so.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.315
And I know, 'cause I was
the one they would complain to.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.118
I mean, you should have seen
the angry faxes I would get.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.854
"Hecks" and "darns"
flying all over the place.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.489
JAY:
Babe, great news.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.757
They love the room.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.427
But do they, Sam?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.961
Do they?

06:02.095 --> 06:04.432
ISAAC:
What do you say
we head up to the mansion?

06:04.465 --> 06:06.166
There's just not much
to do here.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.235
Not much to do? Hello?

06:08.268 --> 06:11.772
Have you not experienced
the drama of the ants?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.774
Now, those boys have pep.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.643
Yep, certainly can't deny
the pep.

06:15.676 --> 06:19.112
And yet, at the mansion,
we have the added benefit

06:19.146 --> 06:20.414
of watching television

06:20.448 --> 06:22.816
and not being watched
by your former lover.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.118
Just pretend
I'm not even here.

06:25.152 --> 06:28.556
Okay, it's just--

06:28.589 --> 06:31.425
Nigel, do you have a problem
with where I live?

06:31.459 --> 06:34.862
What? No.
I love the mansion.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.898
If I were forced
to pick nits,

06:37.931 --> 06:40.801
your friend Thorfinn
can be a bit much.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.037
Oh. Oh, this is
about Thorfinn.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.474
It's just, the yelling
and the jocularity.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.943
And he murder stories
and the endless cod anecdotes.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.980
Yes, no, I get it.
I get it, trust me. (laughs)

06:53.013 --> 06:54.548
You know what I'll do?
I'll just ask him, um,

06:54.582 --> 06:56.984
to rein in his energy a bit.
I'm sure he'll understand.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.285
(sighs)

06:58.318 --> 07:01.789
Oh, God, I was so nervous
to bring this up,

07:01.822 --> 07:03.356
but I'm so glad that I did.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.792
As am I.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.495
You know, I think we work
very well together.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.863
(scoffs)
Heard that before.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.799
Thank you.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.267
SAMANTHA:
I found Tom and Debbie's
Yelp profile.

07:14.301 --> 07:18.138
Geez, look at these reviews.
These people are vicious.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.173
"The only thing worse
than the day-old bread

07:20.207 --> 07:22.375
"at Linda's Shrimp Shack
was the foul smell

07:22.409 --> 07:25.012
coming from the kitchen.
Steer clear. One star."

07:25.045 --> 07:26.580
It's weird.
They seem so nice.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.549
Pete says it's common.
He dealt with this

07:28.582 --> 07:29.783
all the time back when
travel agents

07:29.817 --> 07:31.485
were still a thing.
Hurtful.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.954
Okay, well, there's
a couple good ones in here.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.489
So I guess we just got
to do our best

07:35.523 --> 07:37.758
and then we try to get
one of those.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.561
There is one
other possibility.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.629
We spy on them.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.663
Not for our
entertainment

07:42.696 --> 07:44.131
but to help you guys.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.099
See what they're really saying
behind closed doors.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.435
And doing behind closed doors.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.271
They're like 60.
I'm very bored.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.473
SAMANTHA:
I know we were
against it before,

07:53.507 --> 07:55.408
but it's not the worst idea.
What's happening?

07:55.442 --> 07:58.111
The ghosts are saying
they could spy on the guests.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.547
JAY:
No.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.148
But if Tom and Debbie
have complaints,

08:01.181 --> 08:03.216
then we can find out
and course-correct

08:03.250 --> 08:04.552
while they're still here.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.719
It's so creepy,

08:05.753 --> 08:09.990
not to mention
totally unethical.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.359
two-faced Duluthers,
you do what you gotta.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.393
Jay, think about it.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.461
People could think that

08:14.494 --> 08:15.729
our one bad review
was a fluke,

08:15.763 --> 08:18.498
but two bad reviews?
Our only reviews?

08:18.532 --> 08:19.867
Would you stay
at that B and B?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.769
We're not gonna have
two bad reviews.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.704
We're gonna crush this,

08:23.737 --> 08:25.673
without creepy ghost spying.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.974
No offense. Okay?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.642
Okay, you're right.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.578
Thank you.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.615
So you want to go
with our thing?

08:34.648 --> 08:35.883
Oh, hell yes.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.885
Yes!
(laughter)

08:43.190 --> 08:45.425
Thor? Thor, remember
when Nigel was over

08:45.458 --> 08:47.928
and we were watching that
television show earlier,

08:47.961 --> 08:49.229
How About Those '90s?

08:49.262 --> 08:51.298
(laughs)
Yes! Most interesting decade.

08:51.331 --> 08:56.203
Probably best '90s since 1190s,
though 1490s were pretty wild.

08:56.236 --> 09:00.473
Yes. Anyway, um, you were kind
of, like, doing this thing

09:00.507 --> 09:04.011
where you were talking over
people and hitting people

09:04.044 --> 09:05.779
and just being
very boisterous.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.015
And it was just
a little bit much.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.450
And, um, I was just
wondering if maybe you could

09:10.483 --> 09:12.019
tone it down a little?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.254
Where is all this
coming from?

09:14.287 --> 09:16.890
Isaac and Thor
always watch TV together.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.425
Never complain before.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.528
W-Well, if you must know,
it's coming from Nigel.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.664
And I would push back,
it's just that it's

09:23.697 --> 09:25.966
so new, and I do
enjoy his company.

09:25.999 --> 09:30.938
I see. So... Isaac
embarrassed of Thor.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.540
No, I'm just simply saying
that when Nigel's around,

09:33.573 --> 09:36.143
maybe you're around less.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.712
So mere presence
of Thor is problem.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.781
Yes. Well put.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.216
Fine! Thor won't be around.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.219
Thor go where he won't be
problem for you anymore.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.389
Where he won't be problem
for anyone!

09:49.422 --> 09:52.459
Okay, well, thank you
for hearing me.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.294
They call these sheets.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.830
They are as thin
as that toilet paper.

09:56.864 --> 10:00.033
Man, Debbie is really chafed
about that toilet paper.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.635
Literally.
(laughs)

10:01.669 --> 10:03.637
Knock, knock.
Room service.

10:03.671 --> 10:04.638
Hey.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.139
Jay's homemade cookies.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.607
So, how are you settling in?

10:07.641 --> 10:08.709
Everything okay
with the room?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.077
Oh, everything's perfect.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.611
Could not be better.
Yes.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.913
Lies.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.115
Thin sheets, hard
towels, cheap TP.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.350
Debbie's really chafed
about it. (laughs)

10:17.384 --> 10:18.752
Sam hadn't heard it yet.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.721
You know, are those
our summer sheets?

10:20.754 --> 10:22.189
Would you mind if I changed them

10:22.222 --> 10:23.623
for something
a little more plush?

10:23.657 --> 10:24.825
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.826
These are fine.

10:25.859 --> 10:26.860
He said he'd rather sleep

10:26.894 --> 10:28.128
on his boat tarp, Sam.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.163
No, I insist.
Let me change them.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.065
I slept
on a boat tarp once

10:32.099 --> 10:34.367
with several members
of Fleetwood Mac.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.437
Little uncomfortable
but super easy cleanup.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.841
NANCY:
Hey, guys.

10:40.874 --> 10:44.144
Oh, it's upstairs.
How lovely.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.314
Listen, you guys got to do
something about your boy Thor.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.784
He's totally depressed and he's
bumming out the whole basement.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.920
And we like to keep it light
down there.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.388
Wait, what's Thor
doing in the basement?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.257
He moved down there,
after Pantaloons here

10:57.290 --> 10:58.726
told him to get lost

10:58.759 --> 11:01.729
because his British boy toy
doesn't want Thor around.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.765
Isaac, is that so?
Is it telling the truth?

11:04.798 --> 11:07.768
No, I-I merely suggested
he tone down his energy a bit.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.369
I suppose, upon exit,

11:09.402 --> 11:11.338
he did cryptically promise
he'd not be around anymore,

11:11.371 --> 11:14.441
but I just thought
that was his Viking temper.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.243
Isaac, go apologize to Thor.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.279
No.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.781
No.

11:20.814 --> 11:24.051
I don't even know what
this thing is with Nigel yet,

11:24.084 --> 11:26.453
but whatever it is, I don't want
to ruin it before it starts.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.521
So I'm sorry
that Thor is unhappy,

11:28.555 --> 11:31.358
but when is it my chance
to be happy? Hmm?

11:31.391 --> 11:33.861
When is it
old Higgintoot's turn?

11:35.328 --> 11:37.497
Oh, God.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.832
(exhales)

11:38.866 --> 11:40.700
Thank you for coming.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.302
You're welcome.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.303
Leave.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.905
Okay. Oh.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.840
JAY:
What'd they think
of the cookies, huh?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.108
They said they loved them.

11:48.141 --> 11:51.144
Yes. Mwah. See? I told you
we'd crush it.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.780
Bad news, Sam.
They hated the cookies.

11:52.813 --> 11:56.383
Oh, although
I tried one myself

11:56.416 --> 11:57.484
and I had some thoughts.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.952
Tom didn't like
the salt on top.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.720
I wasn't sure about
the salt on top.

12:00.754 --> 12:04.691
But other than that, seriously,
babe, the cookies were perfect.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.459
Debbie's saying there's
too many chocolate chips.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.863
Although maybe there were
too many chocolate chips,

12:09.897 --> 12:11.664
now that I reflect
upon it further.

12:11.698 --> 12:12.966
(chuckles)
What's going on?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.135
You always loved my
chocolate chip cookies.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.504
Okay, I hadn't wanted
to hurt your feelings,

12:17.537 --> 12:21.775
but Tom and Debbie actually
did say something to me.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.143
What? Really?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.511
It was very out
of character,

12:24.544 --> 12:26.279
but it's growth for
them, which is good.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.315
Okay, well, I'm just
gonna talk to them.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.117
Wait, what? No-no.
Why?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.852
What is going on?

12:31.885 --> 12:33.653
Hmm?
First they love the cookies,

12:33.686 --> 12:37.257
now they don't, and now you
don't want me to talk to them?

12:37.290 --> 12:39.292
Oh, boy. He's putting it
together.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.829
Oh, my God, you did
have the ghosts spy.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.797
Busted.
Just a little bit.

12:43.831 --> 12:44.998
Unbelievable.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.466
Not a great turn
of events for Sam,

12:46.499 --> 12:49.402
but Jay's one hell
of a gumshoe.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.838
Okay, yes, I should
have told you.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.305
But honestly, it's working.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.342
I am able to respond in real
time to their every need.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.210
What did I miss?
Jay figured it out.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.147
Ooh, exciting.
Which one's Jay?
SAMANTHA: I get it.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.049
It's hard to hear criticism.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.151
But honestly, if Tom and Debbie
thought that I was

13:04.184 --> 13:07.888
doing something wrong,
I would love to know about it.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.722
Trevor, shh!
Wait, what?

13:09.756 --> 13:11.158
We didn't want to say
anything.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.426
We know you're not the
best at taking criticism.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.162
I can handle it.
JAY:
Oh.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.364
Do the ghosts have
some opportunities

13:17.397 --> 13:18.665
for you to improve?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.300
Debbie thinks
you're too chatty.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.869
Too chatty? That is...

13:23.136 --> 13:24.905
...very useful criticism.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.806
Thank you for letting me know.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.642
I will strive to improve
that area of my personality

13:29.676 --> 13:31.678
during the remainder
of their visit.

13:31.711 --> 13:35.082
Seems like she could've said
that in a lot less words.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.590
Well, I am ready
to strap on the old feedbag.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.692
(laughs) Something
smells delicious.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.527
Oh, I believe that is
Jay's famous duck.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.828
But before the main event,

13:48.862 --> 13:50.697
your farm-to-table
dinner starts with

13:50.730 --> 13:52.232
a wide assortment
of taste delights

13:52.265 --> 13:54.634
from across the Hudson.
Keep it brief, motormouth.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.236
I'll get your salads.
TOM:
Oh.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.404
(small chuckle)

13:57.437 --> 13:59.739
Odd woman.
Agreed.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.609
TV ANNOUNCER:
The year was 1996,

14:02.642 --> 14:04.912
and the Spice Girls
were everywhere.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.314
This new fab five
burst onto the scene

14:07.347 --> 14:09.616
with their message
of female empowerment

14:09.649 --> 14:11.851
and, above all,
loyalty to your friends.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.453
Hmm.
* If you wanna be my lover...

14:13.486 --> 14:15.022
Loyalty to friends.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.624
I guess the '90s were
a different time.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.427
* Friendship never ends...

14:20.460 --> 14:22.930
Damn these English bards.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.331
Catchy.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.067
* Taking is too easy,
but that's the... *

14:27.100 --> 14:28.969
Okay, so apparently
they're loving your bread rolls,

14:29.002 --> 14:31.304
but they think that I slouch
and do other stuff wrong.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.240
Hi, couple more action items.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.841
Uh, they do not like the
playlist, they think you hover,

14:34.874 --> 14:37.077
your voice is too high,
and the pattern

14:37.110 --> 14:38.878
in your grandmother's butter
dish is satanic.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.814
And now they hate my playlist,
they think that I tend to hover,

14:41.848 --> 14:43.951
that my voice is too high, and
apparently that the pattern

14:43.984 --> 14:46.419
on my grandmother's
butter dish is satanic.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.820
JAY:
I hate these people.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.723
Ugh... I better get
back out there.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.160
Oh, I don't like the look
of this fork.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.128
It's dingy, like the house.
Yeah, look at this.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.096
Here are your salads.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.764
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.332
Yummy.
I'm gonna switch
out the butter dish,

14:59.366 --> 15:01.601
'cause why not, right?
(laughs)
Okay.

15:01.634 --> 15:02.902
Is it too bright in here?

15:02.936 --> 15:05.805
No, not at all-- Thank you.
Thank you.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.807
Hmm. That's better.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.009
You're hovering, and somehow

15:09.042 --> 15:10.510
your voice has gotten
even higher.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.879
(deep voice):
I'll let you enjoy
your salads.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.681
Thank you.
Thank you.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.318
(snoring)

15:20.587 --> 15:22.122
Is he...

15:22.155 --> 15:23.856
Asleep? Yeah.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.226
The floor's pretty uneven,
so we tend to sleep standing up.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.896
Like livestock. You'll get used
to it after a few decades.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.131
NIGEL:
Why on earth have you

15:31.164 --> 15:33.633
dragged us down
to this miserable pit?

15:33.666 --> 15:35.002
Because I have something
to say to Thor,

15:35.035 --> 15:37.204
and I need you to hear it.
Thor?

15:37.237 --> 15:38.538
Isaac.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.241
I'm sorry.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.311
You are a good friend,
and I have treated you poorly,

15:44.344 --> 15:48.581
and I would like you
to come back upstairs.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.884
You... truly mean this?

15:51.918 --> 15:54.387
Thor not annoying?

15:54.421 --> 15:57.757
Well, those are two
different questions, but yes.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.958
No, I mean it.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.328
And, Nigel,
I care about you.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.563
But something I learned today
is that if you want to be

16:03.596 --> 16:06.799
my special companion, you got
to get with my Viking friend.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.169
Oh.
NIGEL: I see.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.504
I didn't realize
how much he meant to you.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.341
Yes. Neither did I.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.812
Thorfinn, forgive me.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.714
Perhaps I judged you
too hastily.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.551
Is okay.
Thorfinn acquired taste,

16:24.584 --> 16:26.653
like sour ram's testicle.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.091
God knows I'm not
everyone's cup of tea.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.660
I like sitting in a dirty shed
watching ants all day.

16:33.693 --> 16:34.694
THORFINN:
Wait.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.962
You like watching ants?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.465
Thor loves
watching ants, too!

16:38.498 --> 16:40.267
Basement ants best ants.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.568
Come. Yes.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.771
Oh! Now, these boys
have gumption.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.374
(laughs)
Thor and Nigel bonding.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.610
NIGEL:
You and Isaac should come to
the shed to watch our ants.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.080
ISAAC:
Oh, good, back to the shed.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.649
Jay, how are we coming
with that duck?

16:56.683 --> 16:58.017
Did you change
your sweater?

16:58.051 --> 16:59.686
Oh, yeah, apparently
Debbie thought I was looking

16:59.719 --> 17:02.522
a little washed out.
(chuckles)
Okay, here's a thought.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.824
Tom and Debbie suck.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.526
I agree with that.
Jay.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.794
I am sick of sitting here

17:07.827 --> 17:09.096
and listening to
them criticize

17:09.129 --> 17:11.264
the best person
that I know.
Aw.

17:11.298 --> 17:14.101
Sam, I think they're
crazy with this one,

17:14.134 --> 17:17.070
but they hate your perfume.
JAY:
What's wrong?

17:17.104 --> 17:19.172
They don't like my perfume.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.873
The perfume
your mom gave you?

17:20.907 --> 17:22.842
Yeah, it's okay.
It's a little old-fashioned.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.412
Nope. Uh-uh.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.648
Uh, Jay?

17:28.681 --> 17:29.716
Ooh, it's on.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.151
DEBBIE:
Oh, a visit from the chef.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.952
TOM:
Ah, is it time for our duck?

17:32.985 --> 17:35.388
Oh, if you think you're getting
even a nibble of my duck,

17:35.422 --> 17:36.989
you are sorely mistaken.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.426
Look, it's one thing to complain
about cookies and candles,

17:39.459 --> 17:41.728
but the fact that you could
find anything bad to say

17:41.761 --> 17:44.364
about my wonderful wife

17:44.397 --> 17:46.299
is bonkers.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.034
Yeah, she's a
little talkative,

17:48.067 --> 17:49.802
but I love every word.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.139
She's kind
and she's smart.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.141
And her voice is mellifluous.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.276
And she's got a great ass.

17:56.309 --> 18:00.313
And I know no one's debating
that, but I'm on a roll.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.814
And you know what else?

18:01.848 --> 18:03.583
Jay's cookies aren't too
salty, they're amazing.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.152
And he's got a great ass.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.419
And you might not be able
to see it in these pants,

18:06.453 --> 18:08.121
but if you put him in,
like, a soft jean

18:08.155 --> 18:10.757
or maybe a chino,
your jaw would drop.
Thank you.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.525
Well, this is not gonna
make for a good Yelp review,

18:12.559 --> 18:15.094
but God bless these crazy kids.
TOM: Wait.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.796
How do you know
we said any of that?

18:16.829 --> 18:20.333
Um, thin walls.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.734
Very thin.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.971
What-- You've been
eavesdropping on us.
Why?

18:25.004 --> 18:28.841
Because we're trying
to start a business

18:28.875 --> 18:30.477
and we read all your
vicious Yelp reviews,

18:30.510 --> 18:33.079
and we were just trying to do
something to make you happy.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.382
What do you mean you read
our Yelp reviews?
(chuckles)

18:35.415 --> 18:37.250
Those reviews are
anonymous.
That's right.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.487
No, we can see your
names and pictures.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.355
Uh, no.
No, no, no, no.

18:42.389 --> 18:46.293
No, that is what we see
on our computer.
Right.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.860
No, I can show you.

18:47.894 --> 18:52.332
Okay. Yeah.
Well, we'll look.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.901
(gasps)
This is not good.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.837
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
We went after everyone.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.407
They're all there.
Oh, no, we tore apart
your sister's Shrimp Shack.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.075
DEBBIE: This is a nightmare.
We have to move.
TOM: Oh. Oh, no.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.345
Wh-Where are you going, Tom?

19:05.378 --> 19:06.846
To unplug my laptop, Debbie.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.381
We got to get
those reviews off-line.

19:08.415 --> 19:12.519
Well, I don't think that's
how it works, Tom. Tom!

19:12.552 --> 19:15.822
PETE:
Yelp reviews may not be
anonymous, but you know what is?

19:15.855 --> 19:18.090
Conversations with your
trusted travel agent.

19:18.124 --> 19:21.394
Unless you tell me you murdered
someone. Or stole a robe.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.500
JAY:
Oh, babe.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.135
Tom and Debbie left us
a Yelp review.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.803
Oh, I'm so nervous.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.373
"There may be nicer
places to stay

19:33.406 --> 19:35.675
and softer sheets
to lay upon..."

19:35.708 --> 19:36.676
Let it go, Debbie.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.877
"... but the proprietors

19:37.910 --> 19:39.111
"of the charming
Woodstone B and B

19:39.145 --> 19:40.913
really care about
their guests."

19:40.947 --> 19:44.016
Oh. "Sam and Jay not only
anticipated our every need

19:44.050 --> 19:46.653
"but alerted us to the tragic
hacking of our Yelp account,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.020
"which led to the besmirching
of some of our

19:48.054 --> 19:50.657
"favorite institutions,
including the delicious

19:50.690 --> 19:52.625
and normal-smelling
Linda's Shrimp Shack."

19:52.659 --> 19:53.893
What is hacking?

19:53.926 --> 19:54.894
It means someone broke
into their account,

19:54.927 --> 19:56.162
but Tom and Debbie are lying.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.964
They're just doing
damage control.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.634
Babe, they left
us five stars!

20:01.668 --> 20:03.202
(cheering)

20:03.236 --> 20:05.071
"And this is our vow
to you, people of Yelp,

20:05.104 --> 20:07.407
we will not rest until we find
the real hackers."

20:07.440 --> 20:09.976
Oh, like O.J. with the
real killers. (laughs)

20:10.009 --> 20:11.177
I bet he found them.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.845
That fellow seemed
very determined.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.348
Well, seems like
it all worked out.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.250
Yeah, but I don't want
this to be an endorsement

20:17.284 --> 20:18.351
for you to keep using

20:18.385 --> 20:20.219
these ghosts
behind my back.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.589
It is the last time
I do that, I promise.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.590
Good.

20:23.623 --> 20:24.724
Unless, like,

20:24.757 --> 20:26.158
it's something
really important, right?

20:26.192 --> 20:29.195
Mm-hmm.
What's that?
