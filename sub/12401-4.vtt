 The afflictions of this world

01:42.369 --> 01:46.138
  became too much
  for Norville Grant to bear,

01:48.142 --> 01:50.642

      to leave them behind,

         not to wear it to work.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.036
       Could have been anywhere.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.739
           Where'd you find it?

10:40.741 --> 10:44.009
Someone turned it in
down at the station.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.045
It's good to know
we still got us some
honest folks out there.

a coincidence, you know,

11:56.883 --> 11:59.317
but given how small
this fucking town is,

11:59.319 --> 12:01.219

12:02.422 --> 12:04.355
        What are you doing here?

12:04.357 --> 12:07.459
Just some new business,
some old business.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.531
Speaking of which,
I saw Megan today.
She looked good.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.667
                 Aah!

12:15.669 --> 12:17.335

14:22.362 --> 14:24.529

       I got a new phone.
       Where are you?

14:27.367 --> 14:30.368
    I'm at the thrift store.
    What's wrong?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.004
 I ran into Donnie last night.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.974
     He said he saw you.
     Did something happen?

14:38.879 --> 14:40.378
             Megan?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.651
        I was at dinner
        and he, um...

14:48.088 --> 14:49.587
       Nothing happened.

     KYLE:
     What are we gonna do?

     Yes, you can.
                 Megan.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.896
      Aren't you in enough
      trouble as it is?

14:57.898 --> 15:01.332
 The last thing you need to do
 is get mixed up with him.

15:02.535 --> 15:06.905
   MEGAN:
   You didn't, did you? Kyle?

15:06.907 --> 15:08.606
      I can't do nothing,
      you know that.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.108

    Thanks for checking in,
    shithead, but I'm fine.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.219
          But, Megan--

15:21.221 --> 15:22.754
          I gotta go.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.622
             Hey.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.145
I went by the church.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.248
Florence said
you was out here.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.550
           That woman
           cannot keep a secret.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.187
You been out here all day?

15:58.058 --> 16:00.024
    I have a confession to make.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.995
       One of the things
       that sucks about this job

16:03.997 --> 16:06.297
       is that everybody
       wants something from you.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.133
       Every misery they suffer,

16:09.135 --> 16:10.835
            every dying grandma,

16:10.837 --> 16:13.471
    every cheating husband,

16:13.473 --> 16:15.707
     all gets dumped on me.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.743
Sometimes I just need a break.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.478
Don't we all.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.482
        Come on. Give me a hand.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.655
       You tracked me down,
       so what can I do for you?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.758
Well, how's it
you get your...

16:33.760 --> 16:36.494
I don't know what
you call 'em, cases, victims?

16:36.496 --> 16:39.530
Is it like, you got
a bat phone in the church
or something?

16:39.532 --> 16:40.832
                      (chuckles)

16:40.834 --> 16:42.967
             Itching for
             some action, right?

16:42.969 --> 16:45.003
            Well...

16:45.005 --> 16:47.105
people close to me
get hurt,

16:47.107 --> 16:49.774
and it's been going on
a long time,

16:49.776 --> 16:52.276
and I think it might
still be going on.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.345
I don't feel like
sitting on my ass anymore.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.980
          You weren't sitting on
          your ass last night.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.149
                 I heard you got
                 knocked on it.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.485
That's old business.
It's got nothing
to do with this.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.720
            The hell it doesn't.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.556
    You got a gift, son,
    and I wanna help you use it.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.157
  But you also got a reputation.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.660
         People gotta be willing
         to let you in the door.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.463
      You wanna fight the devil,
      start by cleaning your
      fucking act up.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.865
You talk to God
with that mouth?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.366
          Oh, he's heard
          a lot worse than that.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.271
        Have any plans
        for the rest of the day?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.442
             Come on. Let's go
             for a little drive.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.315
Forgetting something?

17:31.317 --> 17:33.317
                Oh, thanks, hon.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.055
      Forgetting something else?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.624
                           Damn.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.195
               I'll see you
               in a couple days.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.330
                You put that on.
          Yes, ma'am.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.766
         I don't want one them
         dumb crackers mistaking
         you for a deer.

17:48.768 --> 17:52.403
Those dumb crackers
are our good friends
and neighbors.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.344
               The exorcism
               is a last resort.

18:00.346 --> 18:04.882
   My goal is to not
   have to perform another one.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.618
         And this fruit cocktail
         is your secret weapon?

18:07.620 --> 18:09.587
More like a vaccine.

18:09.589 --> 18:13.925
Our job is to... is to help
people resist the dark forces.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.094
            Deny the devil
            a foot in that door.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.261
            Uh-huh.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.863
    You got a problem with that?
        (doorbell rings)

18:18.865 --> 18:22.066
I just don't see how that
fits in to what happened
with my mom.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.068
Or my wife,
or Joshua Austin.

18:24.070 --> 18:27.805
I mean, what did they
ever do to let the devil in?

18:29.809 --> 18:31.542
                WOMAN:
                Hello, Reverend.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.112
     Sophie, I didn't
     know you were in town.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.647
           Just for the weekend,
           to see Mama.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.116
                        Come in.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.625
    This is Kyle.
    He's helping me
    with the shut-ins today.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.127
               Nice to meet you,
               I'm Sophie.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.228
        Ma'am.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.896
          Mmm, please, no ma'am.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.397
        Oh.

18:53.399 --> 18:54.832
    And how is your mother?

18:54.834 --> 18:57.401
          Um... I'm not so sure.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.506
       Well, what is it?

19:01.508 --> 19:03.141
        Can I talk to you alone?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.490
        I can't do this anymore.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.827
    She used to be so sweet.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.463
   When the kids were little,
   she just doted on 'em.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.598
        They just loved
        to come visit their Oma.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.035
      But now...
      she's a cranky old bitch.

19:31.037 --> 19:34.272
Well, she always
has been a character.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.507
              No, she's changed.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.343
We all change, Sophie,
I mean, um...

19:43.216 --> 19:45.216
          (screaming)

19:47.187 --> 19:49.287
I still think of myself
as a 20-year-old buck,

19:49.289 --> 19:50.655
    and then I look
    at myself in the mirror,

19:50.657 --> 19:52.857
and I don't recognize that
old fart staring back at me.

19:52.859 --> 19:56.360
 No. It's the things she says.

19:56.362 --> 20:00.798
    It's the foul bile
    that comes out of her mouth.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.002
       She called my 13-year-old
       daughter a whore.

20:05.004 --> 20:08.472
        It's like the devil's
        got ahold of her tongue.
Somebody out there?

20:08.474 --> 20:10.241
Who is it?

20:13.346 --> 20:16.881
        (clock chiming)

20:21.921 --> 20:23.721
I'm with the reverend.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.523
              Well, get in here.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.058
             Ma'am.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.427
       We're dropping off
       your groceries.
       I'm Kyle Barnes.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.596
      I know who you are.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.735
    Pity about your mother.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.172
            Oh. Um... thank you.

20:41.174 --> 20:42.607
               It's a nice place
               you got here.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.408
          Used to be.

20:44.410 --> 20:48.980
      But everything goes
      to shit eventually.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.150
      Like your marriage.

20:55.188 --> 20:57.688
 Hard to keep
 a romance alive

20:57.690 --> 21:00.725
  once you start
  throwing punches, isn't it?

21:00.727 --> 21:01.926
             Okay.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.028
What about
the Austin boy?

21:04.030 --> 21:07.064
        I saw his face.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.867
     You, uh, you can't seem
     to help yourself.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.805
    I think I'm gonna go get
    the reverend for you.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.641
        What'd you see?

21:16.643 --> 21:17.775
                       What?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.744
         With the boy?

21:19.746 --> 21:21.812
   When you did that to him,

21:21.814 --> 21:23.547
        what'd you see?

21:31.157 --> 21:32.556
            (scoffs)

21:36.929 --> 21:38.329
       Here. Let me help.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.764
   (screams) Oh!

21:39.766 --> 21:41.132
                   Are you okay?

21:41.134 --> 21:43.401
  Don't touch me! Don't!
           All right, all right.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.669
What happened?
                           Mama?

21:44.671 --> 21:45.770
           She fell.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.072
    Oh...
     All right. Let me help you.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.407
          Come on. Take it easy.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.742
   All right, Mildred,
   I got you.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.177
     Oh.
         There you go.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.313
   (groaning)

21:56.582 --> 22:00.518
God bless your
kind soul, Reverend.

22:00.520 --> 22:04.021
You know I appreciate
your help so much.

22:08.194 --> 22:12.163
       But I'm not up
       for a visit today.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.839
What happened in there?

22:21.841 --> 22:24.775
         She was asking me
         questions about Joshua,

22:24.777 --> 22:26.477
               about what we saw
               that night.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.446
I'm not surprised.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.981
People are always
looking for lurid details.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.284
When she fell,
I went to help her,

22:33.286 --> 22:36.387
and when I touched her,
she reacted just like Joshua,

22:36.389 --> 22:38.322
and Blake.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.658
She's one of 'em,
isn't she?

22:40.660 --> 22:42.560
She's one of the ones
you exorcised.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.198
            About two years ago.

22:49.001 --> 22:52.036
    Took me almost a week
    to drive the demon from her.

22:52.038 --> 22:55.239
And? Was it like with Joshua?
Did you see it come out?

22:55.241 --> 22:57.975
      I told you,
      it's not always like that.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.577
Then how can you
be sure it's gone?

22:59.579 --> 23:02.079
            Because I have faith
            in the power of God
            over the devil.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.649
            Things change, Kyle.
            People get old.

23:05.651 --> 23:08.018
         Sometimes we lose
         something of ourselves.

23:08.020 --> 23:11.322
   But that lady's been sitting
   in the front pew of my church
   for the past two years,

23:11.324 --> 23:14.024
          singing hymns
          and praising the Lord.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.627
  I hope I'd know
  if I was preaching to a demon.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.300

25:36.302 --> 25:38.135
Yeah.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.971
   And every dinner out costs us
   a week of franks and beans.

to dream of having a hero
on a white stallion.
