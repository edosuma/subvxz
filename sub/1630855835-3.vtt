Holy crap, a vintage

01:08.235 --> 01:10.694
From the good old days
when potatoes were men

01:10.780 --> 01:11.820
And had penises.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.447
Peter, they never had penises.

"peppa pig" branded tea sets,

03:14.695 --> 03:15.903

03:15.988 --> 03:18.655
So I sold my tea set
at twice what I paid,

03:18.741 --> 03:19.948
Then I bought more
stuff to sell.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.034
Really? Was it worth that much?

03:22.161 --> 03:24.995
Oh, sweetie, people have no
clue what antiques are worth,

03:25.080 --> 03:26.496

03:26.582 --> 03:29.208
I actually got a booth at
the flea market next weekend.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.126
I have to say,
I'm weirdly impressed.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.587
Yes, who would've thought
a strange little guy like me

03:33.672 --> 03:37.123
Could get super into
tiny details of old furniture.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.634
Well, if you need
any help, I'm in.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.968
All right.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.345
-Is that...
-Yes, most antiques

03:41.430 --> 03:44.640

03:44.767 --> 03:46.683
Well, mostly syrup companies.

03:46.769 --> 03:47.976
Wow, that's very racist.

03:48.062 --> 03:51.063
Yep. Whole-blurry-shelf racist.

03:55.361 --> 03:57.402

04:04.870 --> 04:07.621
After this lesson,
I sit at panera bread

Nearest I can figure,
it's a loan

Brian, time to
teach you my techniques.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.974
Watch and learn.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.434
You have a good eye.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.936
I just sold a piece
by the same artist for 40.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.272
-(whispers): Lie.
-That's a little
out of my budget.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.442
Well, I'd like 30,
but I'd take 25.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.069
(sucks teeth) lowest I could
let it go for is 20.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.279
Would you take 11?

10:14.364 --> 10:16.281
Well the frame alone
is worth 30.

10:16.325 --> 10:17.699
Highest I can do is 12.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.992
Okay, but you got to pay me

10:19.077 --> 10:20.827
Before my wife gets back
from the bathroom.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.746
She's gonna kill me
over this price.

10:24.416 --> 10:27.208
That's the dance. Give it a try.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.836
Hi, there, uh,
how much for this vase?

10:29.921 --> 10:31.713
Five.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.048
What the hell was that?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.507
That's not the dance, man.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.468
You got to put your hands up
higher, move around a bit.

10:36.595 --> 10:37.969
My dance is the tango.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.512
You got to find yours. Go ahead.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.973
-Stewie, I'm not doing thi...
-Find your dance!

10:42.142 --> 10:43.516
A bolero man.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.810
Little dirty,
but nobody's gonna bleed.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.563
You feel that? That's the bluff.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.814
I thought it was "the dance."

10:49.900 --> 10:51.149
Right, but at some point,

10:51.234 --> 10:53.026
The dance becomes the bluff.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.944
Are you just making
all this up as you go?

10:55.030 --> 10:56.655
That's the dance, bri.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.866
All right, brian,
follow my lead.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.618
"van blunder" time.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.411
Ooh, how much for this?

11:03.497 --> 11:04.204
You're gonna hate me.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.830
So, everything you see here

11:05.957 --> 11:07.791
Is for sale, except that.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.084
I don't even know
how it got out here,

11:09.169 --> 11:10.669
It's supposed to be in the van.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.587
Well, I really like it.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.339
Brian, what did you do?

11:14.508 --> 11:17.092
Oh, boy. That was
a blunder on my part.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.719
That's a... That's a...
That's a pretty big blunder.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.471
But look how much she loves it.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.555
Do you love it?

11:22.641 --> 11:25.350
I do. I can give you $10.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.936
Well, I do want it to go
to someone who loves it.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.647
I'll tell you what,
give me 11, and it's a deal.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.357
What a blunder.

11:32.442 --> 11:36.194
This is awkward, but
y'alls horning in on my turf.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.406
See, "grandma's little loft"
is the king of knick-knacks.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.116
Now yous selling 'em.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.409
Ha. That's a laugh.

11:42.494 --> 11:43.868
We'd never sell knick-knacks.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.245
We're tchotchke guys.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.956
If yous calling that
vintage chatillon dial-face

11:47.999 --> 11:49.624
Hanging merchant's
scale a tchotchke,

11:49.751 --> 11:51.126
Y'alls sicker than I thought.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.752
Says the guy who has
his what's-its

11:52.879 --> 11:54.421
Mixed in with his who's-its.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.005
That's potpourri.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.217
Yous out of your league.
That's what's happening here.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.719
You hearing footsteps, gramps?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.429
Hows about a little contest?

12:02.514 --> 12:04.973
Whoever sells the most
by end of day tomorrow

12:05.100 --> 12:06.516
Is the flea market champ.

12:06.685 --> 12:10.478
The loser gets out
of the game. For good.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.980
Fine, you're on.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.773
And by the way,
there was a dead cricket

12:13.859 --> 12:15.191
In the teapot you sold me.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.194
-Oh, no.
-I know.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.658
The hair dye trail
ends right here.

12:25.871 --> 12:26.953
(doorbell rings)

12:27.038 --> 12:29.914
Wait, only one guy
would accept delivery

12:30.000 --> 12:32.250
Of so many hawaiian shirts.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.086
(snoring)

12:35.172 --> 12:37.172
(mustache barking)

12:38.008 --> 12:40.133
What is it, boy?

12:41.428 --> 12:44.596
Man, I love being paid
for reverse mortgages

12:44.681 --> 12:46.389
In hawaiian shirts.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.433
So, it looks like
there's a few more

12:48.518 --> 12:50.477
Disgruntled customers
down there.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.565
Well, that's a 'stache
from the past.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.692
This can't be good. Get in.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.820
Hey, nypd?

13:00.906 --> 13:03.740
Yeah, it's chief whatever-
my-character's-name-is

13:03.867 --> 13:04.866
From<i> blue bloods.</i>

13:04.993 --> 13:06.534
There's a couple of trespassers

13:06.661 --> 13:07.994
Outside my house.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.496
(police siren wails)

13:10.957 --> 13:13.166
You guys are under arrest.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.044
-Is this 'cause I rubbed
on a lady in the subway?
-No.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.087
-'cause I rubbed on
a lady on the bus?
-No.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.756
Do you do a lot of
rubbing on people?

13:19.883 --> 13:22.509
Hey, eight million people,
we all got to fit somewhere.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.476
(sighs)

13:31.603 --> 13:34.145
I'm sorry for dragging
you into this, mr. Mayor.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.773
Lois was right,
this was a stupid plan.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.441
Don't beat yourself up, hoss.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.859
When your cause is just,

13:39.945 --> 13:41.986
Any action you take
is honorable.

13:42.113 --> 13:45.824
Besides, fate has a funny way
of takin' care of folks.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.575
(snores)

13:52.165 --> 13:57.168
I'd be much obliged if you'd
go ahead and open up for me.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.254
How did you do that?

13:59.381 --> 14:00.797
Well, this ain't
the first schlage

14:00.882 --> 14:03.091
To which I've pitched woo.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.679
Oh, brian, look,

14:07.764 --> 14:09.013
It's this antique's last day

14:09.099 --> 14:10.557
Selling antiques.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.976
You alls can eat my dust.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.352
(coughing)

14:14.437 --> 14:17.105
Oh, we got quite
a showdown here today

14:17.190 --> 14:18.815
At flea market regionals, jim.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.942
"grandma's little loft"
has the experience,

14:20.986 --> 14:24.070
But don't count out "the brian,
the bitch, and the wardrobe."

14:24.197 --> 14:26.948
And the question we've been
hearing the most today:

14:27.033 --> 14:29.284
Why does a flea market
have announcers?

14:29.411 --> 14:31.202
Well, sometimes major
network announcers

14:31.329 --> 14:33.413
Have one too many
at a golf tournament

14:33.582 --> 14:34.706
And hit a guy in their car

14:34.833 --> 14:36.457
And then have to
work their way back.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.544
Hi, do you have any vintage
southwestern lifestyle stuff?

14:39.629 --> 14:41.588
Bro, it's 7:30 a.M.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.381
That stuff is long gone by 5:15.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.675
I's about to open
a storage container

14:45.760 --> 14:47.927
Fresh from tempe. Come on by.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.387
-What?
-How is that possible?

What a comeback.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.323
Boy, you said it.
I told espn I'd quit

Hey, before I go...

16:48.842 --> 16:50.675
Would y'all be willing to
sell your whole inventory

16:52.637 --> 16:54.262
-Would you do 11?
-No.

Said I could have another
plate of lasagna.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.832

Peter, I think you and I
might just have to

19:13.236 --> 19:15.069
Agree to disagree
when it comes to

19:15.196 --> 19:18.406
The financial propriety
of reverse mortgages.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.783
That said, I certainly
never meant

19:20.910 --> 19:22.451
To cause you any distress.

And wild, back in the day,

19:25.039 --> 19:26.831
I turned my back on you,

19:26.916 --> 19:29.542
And I turned my back
on my mustache.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.128
Think you can forgive me?

19:42.182 --> 19:43.806
To be any hard feelings,

19:43.892 --> 19:45.474
So I'm gonna write you a check

19:45.643 --> 19:48.311
For a little bit of

19:48.438 --> 19:50.813

How are you 78?

19:57.030 --> 19:58.404
This ought to take care of it.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.823
And hey, just to
make sure we're good,

20:00.909 --> 20:03.451
How'd you like
a line on the show?

20:03.536 --> 20:04.702
<i> Blue bloods.</i>

20:04.787 --> 20:07.496
It might not be just
saying the show.

20:07.582 --> 20:10.082
I understand.
Tom, would it be possible

20:10.168 --> 20:11.626
For me to get another
plate of lasagna?

20:11.753 --> 20:14.212
That's not my call, peter.
That's shannon's call.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.088
It's not shannon's call.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.223
Follow that car.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.849
First time in the big city?

20:26.976 --> 20:28.184
<i> Blue bloods.</i>

20:28.269 --> 20:29.977
That last line was improvised.
