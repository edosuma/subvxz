Shane Smith:
<i>This week on</i> Vice:

00:08.494 --> 00:11.695
<i>Modern science's quest
for longer lifespans.</i>

00:13.966 --> 00:16.367
Nir Barzilai:
<i>Aging can be manipulated.</i>

00:16.402 --> 00:19.735
It's science now,
not science fiction.

00:19.771 --> 00:21.504
Isobel Yeung: Man, you're
gonna come out of this

00:21.540 --> 00:22.972
charged like a superhuman.

00:23.007 --> 00:24.807
How long do you think
you're gonna live for?

00:24.842 --> 00:26.142
I'm happy with 100.

00:26.178 --> 00:30.213
Smith: <i>And then, the dawn of a new
age in artificial intelligence.</i>

00:30.248 --> 00:35.684
just human-like enough,
and almost repulsive in a way.

00:35.719 --> 00:38.320
These robots, they don't
have to learn by doing,

00:38.355 --> 00:40.522
they can learn by thinking.

00:47.398 --> 00:48.697
Yeung:
Go, go, go!

00:51.569 --> 00:53.067
Refugee:
We are not animals!

01:04.647 --> 01:05.913
Human life expectancy

01:05.948 --> 01:08.549
has been growing steadily
for over 100 years.

01:08.585 --> 01:10.783
<i>At the beginning
of the 20th century,</i>

01:10.819 --> 01:13.520
<i>on average, people
lived for 47 years,</i>

01:13.555 --> 01:15.322
<i>today, it's 79.</i>

01:15.357 --> 01:16.889
And it's believed
that the first person

01:16.925 --> 01:20.560
to live to 150
has already been born.

01:20.596 --> 01:24.331
So, we sent Isobel Yeung to learn about
advances in science and medicine

01:24.366 --> 01:28.500
that are poised to radically expand
our life expectancy even further.

Yeung: <i>In southern Japan,
living a long life</i>

01:55.194 --> 01:58.296
<i>is one of the greatest human achievements.</i>

02:00.766 --> 02:03.400
Yeung: We're just driving
through the streets of Okinawa,

02:03.435 --> 02:06.136
joining a Kajimaya celebration,
which is this lady... Hi!

02:06.171 --> 02:08.739
This lady turning 97.

02:08.774 --> 02:11.575
Okinawa actually has one of the
oldest populations in the world.

02:11.610 --> 02:14.578
When someone turns 97,
it's a sort of a turning point,

02:14.613 --> 02:16.413
when you return
to your innocence,

02:16.448 --> 02:19.982
and everyone seems
to be really happy.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.719
Yeung: <i>So many Okinawans
live past 100,</i>

02:23.755 --> 02:26.822
<i>that the entire island chain is known
as a "blue zone."</i>

02:28.793 --> 02:30.393
<i>Meaning, it's a
longevity hot spot,</i>

02:30.428 --> 02:32.795
<i>where the rate
of centenarians per capita</i>

02:32.830 --> 02:34.896
<i>is among the highest on Earth.</i>

02:35.899 --> 02:38.266
Yeung:
Aw, that's so cool!

02:38.302 --> 02:40.702
God, there's so many
old people in this town.

02:41.938 --> 02:43.938
Everyone's just trying
to get a glimpse of her,

02:43.973 --> 02:46.675
congratulate her,
get to shake hands with her.

02:46.710 --> 02:48.075
She's like a little local celeb.

02:58.321 --> 02:59.753
Yeung:
What's your secret?

03:07.330 --> 03:08.828
Yeung: <i>Okinawans
have far lower rates</i>

03:08.863 --> 03:12.298
<i>of cancer, heart disease
and dementia than Americans,</i>

03:12.334 --> 03:15.768
<i>and the reasons why
are no longer a mystery.</i>

03:15.804 --> 03:18.838
<i>For over 40 years,
Dr. Makoto Suzuki</i>

03:18.873 --> 03:20.506
<i>has been chronicling the details</i>

03:20.542 --> 03:23.008
<i>of the oldest lives in Okinawa.</i>

03:23.044 --> 03:24.677
These are all your studies?
Yeah.

03:27.113 --> 03:29.013
Wow.

03:29.049 --> 03:31.289
This guy looks pretty happy and healthy.

03:32.486 --> 03:33.518
Yeung:
Just 100.

03:33.554 --> 03:35.687
How old is this person?

03:37.424 --> 03:38.990
Gosh, she looks amazing.
Yeah.

03:39.025 --> 03:41.626
Who is the oldest person
you've studied? Uh...

03:43.229 --> 03:44.495
111?
Mmm.

03:44.530 --> 03:48.499
Why is Okinawa unique
in terms of its longevity?

04:39.682 --> 04:42.517
Yeung: <i>This Okinawan study
is part of an emerging field</i>

04:42.552 --> 04:45.152
<i>of longevity research
taking place worldwide</i>

04:45.187 --> 04:49.590
<i>in the hopes of unlocking the biological
mysteries of the longest lived.</i>

04:49.626 --> 04:52.726
<i>One of the most renowned is the
Institute for Aging Research</i>

04:52.761 --> 04:54.861
<i>at the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine,</i>

04:54.897 --> 04:57.030
<i>directed by
Dr. Nir Barzilai.</i>

04:57.065 --> 05:02.536
So, how do you plan to allow people
to live a long and healthy life?

05:02.571 --> 05:04.738
We have over 50 labs

05:04.773 --> 05:07.106
that are looking at
the biology of aging

05:07.142 --> 05:08.707
from several perspectives,

05:08.743 --> 05:12.144
and we're trying
to coordinate the efforts,

05:12.179 --> 05:15.614
that can allow us
to target the aging process

05:15.650 --> 05:18.517
and, kind of, slow it
as much as we can.

05:18.553 --> 05:21.854
Barzilai: In this lab,
they're focusing on

05:21.889 --> 05:24.489
how can we turn old cells

05:24.524 --> 05:27.258
into younger, functional cells.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.928
Yeung: <i>Besides cells,
Barzilai and his team</i>

05:29.963 --> 05:32.464
<i>are looking at ways
to hack our metabolisms</i>

05:32.499 --> 05:33.698
<i>and even DNA,</i>

05:33.733 --> 05:36.534
<i>in order to fend off
age-related illnesses.</i>

05:36.570 --> 05:40.705
<i>They've even begun preparing for the
first-ever human clinical trial</i>

05:40.740 --> 05:44.107
<i>of a drug that they believe
will slow the aging process.</i>

05:44.142 --> 05:49.212
Barzilai: Metformin is approved by
the FDA for treatment of diabetes.

05:49.247 --> 05:50.614
Why Metformin?

05:50.649 --> 05:53.784
Because people with diabetes
who take Metformin

05:53.819 --> 05:56.186
have much less
cardiovascular disease,

05:56.221 --> 05:57.888
much less cancers,

05:57.923 --> 05:59.822
much less cognitive decline,

05:59.858 --> 06:04.059
and significantly less mortality
than people without diabetes.

06:05.497 --> 06:09.331
Barzilai: <i>Metformin has
effects on processes like</i>

06:09.367 --> 06:11.200
inflammation,

06:11.235 --> 06:12.768
cellular survival,

06:12.804 --> 06:13.903
stress defense.

06:13.938 --> 06:17.772
What we're predicting,
we'll delay variety of diseases

06:17.808 --> 06:19.875
including mortality,
cardiovascular disease,

06:19.910 --> 06:24.312
Alzheimer's, cancer by
about 30% in this study,

06:24.347 --> 06:26.047
the way we planned it.

06:26.082 --> 06:27.749
Wow.

06:27.784 --> 06:28.850
That's huge.

06:28.886 --> 06:31.753
Yeung: <i>If Dr. Barzilai's
estimates are correct,</i>

06:31.788 --> 06:35.255
<i>average life spans could
jump by up to 25 years,</i>

06:35.290 --> 06:39.092
<i>but while Metformin goes through the
expensive FDA approval process,</i>

06:39.128 --> 06:42.897
<i>dozens of age-defying products
are already being sold.</i>

06:42.932 --> 06:44.498
<i>None of these are
defined as medicine,</i>

06:44.534 --> 06:47.501
<i>which enables them to skirt
the FDA's requirements.</i>

06:49.071 --> 06:52.238
<i>In that gray area,
between being medicinal or not,</i>

06:52.273 --> 06:54.473
<i>are stem cell clinics.</i>

07:03.351 --> 07:04.617
Dr. Halland Chen:
<i>Hi Isobel!</i>

07:04.653 --> 07:06.952
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Dr. Halland.

07:06.987 --> 07:08.486
Welcome to the clinic.

07:08.522 --> 07:10.923
I'll be with you
in just a moment.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.190
Yeung:
Thanks!

07:12.225 --> 07:14.459
Yeung: <i>Stem cell treatments
employ a controversial form</i>

07:14.494 --> 07:18.964
<i>of body hacking that many think
can help you stay forever young.</i>

07:18.999 --> 07:20.566
Small little pinch, okay?

07:20.601 --> 07:23.435
Chen: <i>We do regenerative
medicine here.</i>

07:23.470 --> 07:27.337
<i>We help people feel better by using
the body's own healing abilities.</i>

07:27.373 --> 07:29.907
Yeung: <i>Dr. Chen is
harvesting this woman's fat</i>

07:29.943 --> 07:33.110
<i>so he can collect the mysenchymal
stem cells inside it.</i>

07:33.145 --> 07:35.613
Chen: <i>The basic building block
of our body are stem cells.</i>

07:35.648 --> 07:40.684
<i>As we get older, the amount of viable
and healthy stem cells is less.</i>

07:40.719 --> 07:42.485
<i>We can now cell-shock cells,</i>

07:42.520 --> 07:44.988
<i>and so these stem cells actually
wake up to repair the body.</i>

07:45.023 --> 07:48.357
Yeung: <i>The fat solution is
then shaken up like a martini</i>

07:48.393 --> 07:49.693
<i>to prepare the stem cells,</i>

07:49.728 --> 07:51.227
<i>or as Dr. Chen calls them,</i>

07:51.262 --> 07:54.030
<i>medicinal signaling cells
for activation.</i>

07:54.066 --> 07:56.232
I think this is phenomenal.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.233
I'm very optimistic.

07:58.268 --> 08:00.569
Yeung: <i>This woman is receiving
stem cell treatment</i>

08:00.605 --> 08:02.237
<i>in her knees,
which are arthritic.</i>

08:02.272 --> 08:06.408
Chen: <i> What stem cells do is they basically
recruit other cells into the area.</i>

08:06.443 --> 08:08.143
<i>It's almost like
leaving a honing signal.</i>

08:08.178 --> 08:09.411
So, now the body says,

08:09.446 --> 08:12.848
"Hey! Oh, I'm injured. I
actually should start healing."

08:12.883 --> 08:15.049
Any better?

08:16.486 --> 08:18.853
Look at you go!

08:18.888 --> 08:22.056
Yeung: <i>The FDA has only approved
a few stem cell treatments</i>

08:22.092 --> 08:24.358
<i>because of the limited
clinical trial data.</i>

08:24.393 --> 08:28.830
<i>But Dr. Chen believes that stem cells
not only have orthopedic benefits,</i>

08:28.865 --> 08:31.465
<i>they also may extend our lives,</i>

08:31.501 --> 08:34.433
<i>and he's not just selling
the idea, he's living it.</i>

08:34.469 --> 08:36.035
So, right now,
I'm having my blood taken.

08:36.071 --> 08:38.337
That will then get
processed in a centrifuge,

08:38.373 --> 08:40.774
and then we're gonna
connect it into the IV.

08:40.808 --> 08:42.542
For me, it's for
systemic health.

08:42.577 --> 08:45.211
I feel like if you're constantly
in a state of healing,

08:45.247 --> 08:47.447
the likelihood of getting
sick is extremely low.

08:47.482 --> 08:50.916
I mean, I don't
really get sick at all.

08:50.952 --> 08:53.285
What we're producing is platelet-rich
plasma... Yeung: Mm-hmm.

08:53.320 --> 08:56.188
And that's pretty
commonly known as PRP.

08:56.223 --> 08:58.924
All the regenerative
elements are in there.

09:00.294 --> 09:01.894
Yeung: Okay, so what's
gonna happen here?

09:01.929 --> 09:05.164
He's going to just connect
me to the NAD solution,

09:05.199 --> 09:07.132
replenishing the
mitochondria function.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.432
Yeung: And you do
that simultaneously

09:08.468 --> 09:10.135
whilst you're putting
the plasma back into you?

09:10.170 --> 09:11.569
Correct, plus the laser.
Yeung: Okay.

09:11.604 --> 09:14.438
I'm putting a fiber-optic
cable in my vein.

09:14.474 --> 09:18.176
So, as my heart pumps the cells into the
blood, it passes through the laser,

09:18.211 --> 09:20.011
picking up energy,
its photo-chemistry.

09:20.047 --> 09:22.547
Yeung: How long do you think
you're gonna live for?

09:22.582 --> 09:24.648
I mean, I'm happy with 100.

09:24.684 --> 09:27.885
Yeung: <i>More than 500 of
these boutique-size clinics</i>

09:27.920 --> 09:32.156
<i>are currently operating in the US, without
the need for government approval.</i>

09:32.191 --> 09:34.825
<i>But dwarfing these businesses
are the longevity ventures</i>

09:34.860 --> 09:38.228
<i>being formed by today's
wealthiest tech entrepreneurs,</i>

09:38.263 --> 09:40.563
<i>who are pouring hundreds
of millions of dollars</i>

09:40.598 --> 09:42.799
<i>into disrupting
human life itself.</i>

09:42.834 --> 09:44.967
We don't have to die
a physical death.

09:45.003 --> 09:47.469
Our consciousness can continue
for a longer period of time.

09:47.505 --> 09:50.439
Perpetual life, that's
what we believe in.

09:50.474 --> 09:53.776
Yeung: <i>One of the largest
is run by Craig Venter,</i>

09:53.812 --> 09:56.445
<i>who lists mapping
the first human genome,</i>

09:56.480 --> 09:58.847
<i>and creating the first
forms of synthetic life</i>

09:58.882 --> 10:00.982
<i>as just some
of his achievements.</i>

10:01.018 --> 10:04.652
<i>He's now cofounded
the company Human Longevity.</i>

10:04.688 --> 10:08.423
I hear that you're known as the
Steve Jobs of the biotech world.

10:08.458 --> 10:11.492
That's a good positive one,
so I like that one.

10:13.163 --> 10:16.197
I describe it, I'm sort of the
orchestra conductor, you know.

10:16.232 --> 10:21.268
So, I have close to 600 scientists here
in the three different organizations.

10:21.303 --> 10:25.505
And in the biotech world, there's a
lot of researchers and scientists

10:25.541 --> 10:28.209
but you're an
entrepreneur, essentially.

10:28.244 --> 10:33.079
I think to be a good scientist today,
you have to be entrepreneurial.

10:33.115 --> 10:36.082
Especially in this field...

10:36.118 --> 10:38.118
where it costs so much.

10:38.153 --> 10:41.755
Yeung: <i>Venter has led multiple
biotech firms and foundations</i>

10:41.790 --> 10:43.857
<i>dedicated to the human genome,</i>

10:43.892 --> 10:45.458
<i>including Synthetic Genomics,</i>

10:45.493 --> 10:47.660
<i>and the J. Craig
Venter Institute.</i>

10:47.695 --> 10:50.896
<i>But at Human Longevity,
you can use all that research</i>

10:50.931 --> 10:53.031
<i>to map your own genome...</i>

10:53.067 --> 10:54.666
Good morning!
Good morning.

10:54.701 --> 10:57.102
<i>For the bargain price
of $25,000.</i>

10:57.138 --> 10:58.703
Computerized voice:
<i>Access granted.</i>

10:58.739 --> 11:01.974
Yeung: <i> Instead of simply getting your
blood, and your temperature taken,</i>

11:02.009 --> 11:04.643
<i>HLI's testing takes all day.</i>

11:04.678 --> 11:06.310
This is an electronic floor.

11:06.345 --> 11:08.345
It has thousands of censors,

11:08.381 --> 11:11.749
and this is gonna analyze
your movement, and your gait.

11:11.785 --> 11:14.351
So, I want you to count
out loud, backwards,

11:14.387 --> 11:17.454
by three's, and I want
you to start at 200.

11:17.490 --> 11:19.356
Yeung:
200, 197...

11:19.392 --> 11:21.425
194, 185...

11:21.460 --> 11:24.661
182.

11:24.696 --> 11:25.796
Finger tapping test.

11:25.831 --> 11:29.032
The objective is to tap
a key as quickly as possible.

11:33.172 --> 11:35.738
We actually need
to collect a stool sample.

11:35.774 --> 11:38.708
And you'll just slide
the sample across,

11:38.743 --> 11:40.209
rather than pushing it through...
Okay.

11:40.244 --> 11:42.577
Just slide it across.

11:43.915 --> 11:47.082
Venter: <i>We're used to thinking
of ourselves as intact.</i>

11:47.118 --> 11:51.386
So, it's a very different view
of ourselves. Yeung: Mm-hmm.

11:51.422 --> 11:54.690
Three, two, and one, holding.

11:54.725 --> 11:57.491
Venter:
<i>When we sequence your genome,</i>

11:57.527 --> 12:01.429
<i>we'll find around 8,000
extremely rare variants,</i>

12:01.464 --> 12:05.033
<i>and those are the things
more likely to be linked</i>

12:05.068 --> 12:07.101
to unique traits
or even diseases.

12:07.137 --> 12:08.970
Yeung:
<i>And what proportion of people</i>

12:09.005 --> 12:11.572
<i>who have been through the program
have something wrong with them?</i>

12:11.607 --> 12:15.475
We find in about
40 percent of people

12:15.510 --> 12:19.813
serious, potentially
life-threatening medical issues.

12:24.186 --> 12:27.154
MRI Technician: If you saw bright
spots pop up in these darker regions,

12:27.189 --> 12:28.889
then we would know
that there's a problem there.

12:28.924 --> 12:32.524
Okay, but these are
all normal-looking.

12:32.560 --> 12:37.363
No? Don't scare me! Don't do that! I don't mean
to scare you. I just... you know, I'm not...

12:37.398 --> 12:39.765
I'm not to interpret these,
that's for the radiologist.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.368
Yeung: <i>A few weeks later,
you're given a prognosis</i>

12:42.403 --> 12:44.636
<i>for not just your
present state of health,</i>

12:44.672 --> 12:45.771
<i>but your future as well.</i>

12:45.806 --> 12:48.806
This is the big day when
you get all your results back.

12:48.842 --> 12:50.742
I know, I'm a little bit
nervous to be honest.

12:50.777 --> 12:53.245
We made an avatar of you

12:53.280 --> 12:55.847
with our multiple camera system.
Awesome.

12:55.883 --> 12:58.149
So, overall it's good news.

12:58.185 --> 13:01.219
We didn't find
anything truly wrong.

13:01.255 --> 13:04.154
Now, we only found hints
of early disease.

13:04.190 --> 13:06.623
Slightly higher
than normal liver fat,

13:06.658 --> 13:07.892
insulin sensitivity,

13:07.927 --> 13:12.763
and a slight tendency for
metabolic syndrome and diabetes.

13:12.798 --> 13:15.099
Yeung: Does that mean this
should act as a warning

13:15.134 --> 13:17.667
in terms of my lifestyle?
Absolutely.

13:17.703 --> 13:20.137
You have control,
and that's what most people

13:20.172 --> 13:22.872
don't realize
this data gives you.

13:22.908 --> 13:26.075
Yeung: <i> While the data slapped me with
some long-term issues to mull over,</i>

13:26.111 --> 13:28.111
<i>the real breakthrough here,
is that it can be used</i>

13:28.146 --> 13:31.347
<i>to specifically isolate
and discover deadly diseases,</i>

13:31.383 --> 13:34.650
<i>which drastically lower humanity's
average life expectancy.</i>

13:34.685 --> 13:39.487
With cancer, we've been finding
that at stage zero, stage one,

13:39.523 --> 13:42.357
and early stage two,
where it's completely treatable.

13:42.393 --> 13:47.262
We've found several people that
have episodic atrial fibrillation,

13:47.298 --> 13:50.299
that is one of the major
causes of stroke.

13:50.334 --> 13:52.867
Just putting them
on anticoagulants

13:52.903 --> 13:55.569
can be lifesaving in that case.

13:55.604 --> 13:59.840
We need to have interventions
to overcome defects

13:59.875 --> 14:02.509
in our genetic code
that could lead to early death.

14:02.545 --> 14:05.479
Yeung: <i>But beyond early
detection is a bigger goal.</i>

14:05.514 --> 14:09.783
<i>Venter is coupling the data collected
from Health Nucleus participants</i>

14:09.819 --> 14:12.452
<i>with tens of thousands
of sequenced genomes</i>

14:12.487 --> 14:16.356
<i>to create the first predictive
model of health analysis.</i>

14:16.391 --> 14:18.825
Yeung:
<i>Why is data the answer here?</i>

14:18.860 --> 14:20.860
Venter: <i>The complexity
of the genome,</i>

14:20.895 --> 14:24.097
<i>6.4 billion letters
of genetic code,</i>

14:24.132 --> 14:27.867
<i>is enough on its own that you
need a lot of data to analyze it.</i>

14:27.902 --> 14:29.935
So, we use massive computing,

14:29.971 --> 14:31.870
but we also use
machine learning,

14:31.905 --> 14:33.973
<i>where tools in the computer</i>

14:34.008 --> 14:39.678
<i>can look at data and learn
faster than us mere mortals can.</i>

14:39.713 --> 14:42.181
We're starting to understand
the patterns in the code.

14:42.216 --> 14:47.952
Everyday, our system gets more
and more and more powerful.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.791
Barzilai: <i>I think we're
at the tipping point.</i>

14:53.826 --> 14:56.227
<i>Aging can be manipulated.</i>

14:56.262 --> 14:58.396
It's science now,
not science fiction.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.932
Does the answer
to longer life live within us?

15:01.968 --> 15:03.733
I think so.
I think there's

15:03.768 --> 15:06.436
a lot of things that we haven't
unlocked in human physiology.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.838
The next thing is
how do you activate it.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.573
We're learning things faster

15:10.609 --> 15:13.176
than we've ever learned
in the history of science now.

15:13.212 --> 15:16.980
Anybody that's born
in this next decade,

15:17.016 --> 15:20.849
has a greatly increased chance
of living into triple digits.

15:23.654 --> 15:25.721
Yeung: <i>Where do you think
this is all going?</i>

15:25.756 --> 15:27.623
Venter: <i>I think in two
to 300 hundred years,</i>

15:27.658 --> 15:31.927
there'll be extensive editing
of every human genome,

15:31.962 --> 15:34.696
everything will be based
on genetic predictions,

15:34.732 --> 15:37.532
<i>making people stronger, smarter,</i>

15:37.567 --> 15:39.100
<i>and healthier and living longer.</i>

15:44.207 --> 15:49.044
The world spent more than $71
billion on robotics in 2015,

15:49.079 --> 15:51.479
<i>and the market
for intelligent machines</i>

15:51.515 --> 15:53.781
<i>is expected to more
than triple by 2020.</i>

15:53.816 --> 15:57.651
<i>Now, robots can already
perform complex human tasks,</i>

15:57.686 --> 15:59.553
<i>but as Hamilton Morris
discovered,</i>

15:59.588 --> 16:02.789
their real value may lie in whether
they can become smart enough

16:02.824 --> 16:04.724
to actually think on their own.

16:21.209 --> 16:22.775
Morris:
I'm at IREX,

16:22.810 --> 16:27.180
the world's largest robotics
convention in Tokyo, Japan,

16:27.215 --> 16:32.184
riding on this robotic unicycle
through the exhibitions,

16:32.219 --> 16:36.254
which showcase every
imaginable variety of robot.

16:40.094 --> 16:43.395
<i>There are robotic snakes
for looking through drains.</i>

16:43.430 --> 16:46.063
<i>There's rescue robots,</i>

16:46.099 --> 16:47.231
<i>climbing robots,</i>

16:47.266 --> 16:50.701
<i>breast examination robots.</i>

16:53.706 --> 16:55.939
This body armor
connects me to the robot

16:55.975 --> 16:57.975
which mirrors all the movements.

16:58.010 --> 17:00.478
<i>I put my hand in
the robot's hand,</i>

17:00.513 --> 17:02.145
<i>and then held my own hand,</i>

17:02.180 --> 17:03.713
using my hand
to control the robot.

17:12.290 --> 17:15.558
Definitely has an uncanny
valley effect where it's

17:15.594 --> 17:18.194
just human-like enough

17:18.230 --> 17:21.630
and almost repulsive in a way.

17:23.567 --> 17:25.900
Morris: <i>Some of the
most popular robots</i>

17:25.935 --> 17:30.105
<i>were human-like machines built for
dangerous tasks in disaster recovery.</i>

17:44.587 --> 17:47.021
Morris: <i>Though impressive,
it was surprising how slow</i>

17:47.056 --> 17:50.525
<i>and limited these robots
were at moving like humans.</i>

17:54.062 --> 17:56.463
<i>I visited a robotics lab
in Tokyo</i>

17:56.498 --> 17:57.897
<i>to talk to Shigeo Hirose,</i>

17:57.932 --> 18:02.536
<i>a pioneer in robotics technology,
about why that's the case.</i>

18:02.571 --> 18:06.206
Morris: Why is that this
mechanical innovation moves slowly

18:06.241 --> 18:09.942
relative to the innovation
in software and electronics?

18:30.397 --> 18:33.264
Morris: <i>Essentially, for robots
to become more functional,</i>

18:33.300 --> 18:35.700
<i>they need bigger brains,
not better mechanics,</i>

18:35.735 --> 18:37.635
<i>and the key to unlocking
that brain power</i>

18:37.671 --> 18:41.606
<i>is developing artificial
intelligence, or AI.</i>

18:41.641 --> 18:45.609
<i>Even the tech giant Google is said
to be moving away from the physical</i>

18:45.644 --> 18:47.477
<i>and doubling down on AI.</i>

18:47.513 --> 18:51.881
<i>AI is the science of programming
computers to perceive their environment</i>

18:51.917 --> 18:55.952
<i>and make rational, cognitive decisions
in order to achieve a goal,</i>

18:55.987 --> 18:59.022
<i>and it's one of the most
rapidly progressing</i>

18:59.057 --> 19:01.657
<i>and sought after
technologies in the world.</i>

19:03.194 --> 19:04.993
<i>At Harvard's Center
for Brain Science,</i>

19:05.029 --> 19:07.530
<i>Dr. David Cox is hoping
to model AI</i>

19:07.565 --> 19:09.398
<i>off real biological functions</i>

19:09.434 --> 19:11.701
<i>by mapping the
brains of animals.</i>

19:11.736 --> 19:14.403
A major drive of the
experiments we're doing

19:14.439 --> 19:17.172
is to understand
how brains learn,

19:17.208 --> 19:18.707
and if we understand
how brains learn,

19:18.742 --> 19:20.442
we need to have
the brains be learning.

19:20.477 --> 19:23.578
Cox: <i>And we have rooms full
of these kinds of racks,</i>

19:23.614 --> 19:27.349
<i>and basically what this is, it's
like a video arcade for rats,</i>

19:27.384 --> 19:28.816
<i>and if you look inside,</i>

19:28.852 --> 19:31.319
<i>you can see there are different
little ports that they can lick.</i>

19:31.355 --> 19:34.256
<i>Basically, those are the buttons on
the game controller for the rats</i>

19:34.291 --> 19:37.458
<i>and there's a monitor
in the back of the rig,</i>

19:37.493 --> 19:39.893
and we can train the rats to
distinguish between different things.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.195
Morris:
<i>Once the rats are trained,</i>

19:42.231 --> 19:44.265
<i>Dr. Cox observes
the neuronal activity</i>

19:44.300 --> 19:47.167
<i>inside the rats' brains
while they're thinking.</i>

19:47.202 --> 19:50.738
We've injected a virus
into their brain

19:50.773 --> 19:52.672
that carries a genetically
engineered protein,

19:52.707 --> 19:54.374
which lights up
a little bit brighter

19:54.409 --> 19:57.243
when we shine a laser on it
when the cell is active.

19:57.279 --> 20:01.281
So, this is a way that we can
actually watch the animal think.

20:01.316 --> 20:03.616
Morris: <i>The most
intelligent rats' brains</i>

20:03.652 --> 20:07.287
<i>are divided into slices thousands
of times thinner than a human hair,</i>

20:07.322 --> 20:10.155
<i>and then imaged through
a powerful electron microscope,</i>

20:10.190 --> 20:12.291
<i>and then modeled in 3-D space.</i>

20:12.326 --> 20:15.294
So, what we're doing
is we're marrying behavior,

20:15.329 --> 20:17.796
<i>what the animal can do,
its actual...</i>

20:17.831 --> 20:20.064
<i>its learning,
and how its improving</i>

20:20.100 --> 20:21.833
<i>with the activity
of those neurons,</i>

20:21.868 --> 20:24.569
<i>and then marrying that
with their neuroanatomy.</i>

20:24.605 --> 20:27.171
<i>And from all of this
massive amount of data,</i>

20:27.206 --> 20:29.907
<i>we're gonna try
and really understand</i>

20:29.942 --> 20:34.978
<i>what kinds of algorithms might these
neuronal systems be computing.</i>

20:35.014 --> 20:37.682
<i>What allows biological systems
to do all of these things</i>

20:37.717 --> 20:42.186
<i>that we haven't yet figured out how
to make artificial systems do.</i>

20:42.221 --> 20:45.322
That's gonna unlock
a huge renaissance

20:45.357 --> 20:48.425
in practical robotics,
practical machine learning,

20:48.460 --> 20:50.727
computer vision,
things like that.

20:50.762 --> 20:54.297
Morris: <i> One of the major milestones
in creating human-level intelligence,</i>

20:54.333 --> 20:56.833
<i>is for machines
to attain self-awareness.</i>

20:56.868 --> 21:01.337
<i>Columbia University's Creative
Machines Lab may have already done it.</i>

21:01.372 --> 21:04.206
When you look at this robot,
you can see it has four legs,

21:04.241 --> 21:06.408
but the robot itself does not
know that it has four legs.

21:06.444 --> 21:10.846
All it knows is that it has a couple
of motors, a couple of sensors.

21:10.881 --> 21:12.381
So, if self-awareness works,

21:12.416 --> 21:17.652
this machine should
gradually learn what it is.

21:20.357 --> 21:23.524
Morris: <i>As the robot comes to
life, and takes its first steps,</i>

21:23.560 --> 21:26.060
<i>it tries to understand
what it is.</i>

21:27.430 --> 21:32.834
Lipson: We turn it on, and we
can watch what it thinks it is.

21:32.869 --> 21:35.301
We can actually
look at its memory,

21:35.337 --> 21:38.071
and understand how
it's modeling itself.

21:38.106 --> 21:41.408
Morris: Does it recognize that it
has four tentacles or eight joints?

21:41.443 --> 21:43.443
In the beginning,
it's completely wrong,

21:43.479 --> 21:46.312
<i>but the robot very quickly
knows that they're wrong,</i>

21:46.348 --> 21:49.483
<i>and it basically
hones its self-image</i>

21:49.518 --> 21:51.884
<i>to a point where it
pretty much matches</i>

21:51.919 --> 21:53.686
<i>its experiences in reality.</i>

21:53.721 --> 21:56.822
<i>Using that self-image,
it can learn how to walk</i>

21:56.858 --> 22:02.294
by playing out lots of forms
of locomotion in its mind.

22:02.329 --> 22:05.498
<i>These robots learn over time</i>

22:05.533 --> 22:07.466
<i>to simulate themselves</i>

22:07.502 --> 22:10.535
<i>in a future situation they
haven't actually experienced.</i>

22:10.570 --> 22:12.871
In other words, they don't
have to learn by doing,

22:12.906 --> 22:14.672
they can learn by thinking.

22:16.042 --> 22:18.543
Morris: <i>If these robots
are in the infancy of AI,</i>

22:18.578 --> 22:21.379
<i>their counterparts
at UC Berkeley</i>

22:21.415 --> 22:23.848
<i>are going to kindergarten.</i>

22:23.884 --> 22:25.016
I'm in the arms of BRETT,

22:25.051 --> 22:29.185
the Berkeley Robot for the
Elimination of Tedious Tasks.

22:32.591 --> 22:34.057
Morris:
<i>Using trial and error,</i>

22:34.092 --> 22:35.859
<i>BRETT learns how
to fold laundry,</i>

22:35.895 --> 22:37.193
<i>assemble LEGO blocks</i>

22:37.229 --> 22:38.629
<i>and fit pegs into holes.</i>

22:38.664 --> 22:39.863
Abhishek Gupta:
<i>It goes from scratch.</i>

22:39.899 --> 22:41.932
It has no notion
of how its arms move,

22:41.967 --> 22:44.434
no notion of anything
except for, like, a goal,

22:44.469 --> 22:46.368
and it does some
random set of actions,

22:46.404 --> 22:49.238
<i>and depending on whether
its doing good or bad,</i>

22:49.273 --> 22:51.874
<i>it evaluates that and
keeps updating its policy</i>

22:51.910 --> 22:54.343
<i>to do better and
better and better.</i>

22:54.378 --> 22:57.680
Morris: <i> And like a child, BRETT
can watch someone perform a task,</i>

22:57.715 --> 23:00.982
<i>like tying a knot,
and actually learn it.</i>

23:11.829 --> 23:15.864
Gupta: Now it has to use
both its hands.

23:22.905 --> 23:24.605
There we go.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.274
So, that's how it's
supposed to work, yeah.

23:27.309 --> 23:30.778
Morris: <i>To make robots
like BRETT even smarter,</i>

23:30.813 --> 23:33.280
<i>some AI developers
are using gaming principles</i>

23:33.315 --> 23:35.682
<i>to teach their Als
to strategize.</i>

23:35.717 --> 23:40.753
<i>In 2014, Google reportedly
spent more than $500 million</i>

23:40.789 --> 23:42.421
<i>to acquire DeepMind,</i>

23:42.457 --> 23:44.858
<i>one of the world's
leading AI developers,</i>

23:44.893 --> 23:46.092
<i>led by gaming prodigy</i>

23:46.127 --> 23:48.427
<i>Demis Hassabis.</i>

23:48.463 --> 23:51.630
What is the significance of
games in this sort of research?

23:51.665 --> 23:55.333
Games were invented to be a kind
of microcosm of aspects of life.

23:55.369 --> 23:58.269
They're, um, a very
efficient platform

23:58.305 --> 24:01.874
to sort of develop
AI algorithms and test them.

24:01.909 --> 24:04.510
They can have some of
the richness of the real world,

24:04.545 --> 24:06.177
but they are in
more constrained ways.

24:06.213 --> 24:10.180
Morris: <i> Advancements in computer science
have been tested with games before,</i>

24:10.216 --> 24:13.484
<i>like super-computer
Deep Blue's stunning defeat</i>

24:13.520 --> 24:17.354
<i>of world chess champion,
Garry Kasparov in 1997.</i>

24:17.390 --> 24:20.357
Announcer:
Whoa! Kasparov has resigned.

24:20.393 --> 24:22.226
That was something
well beyond my understanding.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.895
Morris: <i>Now DeepMind
has set out to beat</i>

24:24.930 --> 24:27.764
<i>the most complex
board game in the world.</i>

24:27.799 --> 24:30.901
<i>The ancient Chinese game of Go.</i>

24:30.936 --> 24:34.237
Can you talk a little bit about what makes
this a big deal, why it's important.

24:34.272 --> 24:38.074
There's more possible board positions in
Go than there are atoms in the universe.

24:38.109 --> 24:40.243
Hassabis:
<i>If you ask a great Go player,</i>

24:40.278 --> 24:42.177
<i>why they made a particular move,</i>

24:42.212 --> 24:44.813
<i>they'll often answer
that it just felt right.</i>

24:44.849 --> 24:47.182
<i>That's quite different to when
you ask a great chess player,</i>

24:47.217 --> 24:50.753
<i>they'll usually be able to tell you
precisely the calculations they made.</i>

24:50.788 --> 24:52.755
<i>GO's a lot more about feel.</i>

24:52.790 --> 24:55.624
<i>These great Go players use all
of their years of experience</i>

24:55.660 --> 24:59.460
<i>to just sort of come up with the
right pattern-matching move</i>

24:59.495 --> 25:00.929
<i>that fits for that position.</i>

25:00.964 --> 25:04.632
Morris: <i> In other words, it was
believed you need human intuition,</i>

25:04.668 --> 25:05.900
<i>or else you can't win.</i>

25:05.936 --> 25:10.438
<i>No AI program has ever defeated
a Go world champion before.</i>

25:12.976 --> 25:17.477
<i>To see if DeepMind successfully
built artificial human intuition,</i>

25:17.512 --> 25:20.948
<i>we traveled to South Korea, where
Google organized a Go tournament</i>

25:20.983 --> 25:22.816
<i>with a one-million
dollar prize,</i>

25:22.851 --> 25:25.586
<i>pitting one of the world's
top human players</i>

25:25.621 --> 25:27.320
<i>against AlphaGo.</i>

25:27.355 --> 25:31.458
That was Lee Sedol, who is the
current Go champion walking by.

25:31.493 --> 25:34.393
<i>This is the final game
of the Go championship.</i>

25:34.428 --> 25:37.930
This may be the biggest board
game competition in history,

25:37.966 --> 25:39.966
<i>because this is a human champion</i>

25:40.001 --> 25:42.902
<i>versus the most
sophisticated computer-based</i>

25:42.937 --> 25:45.838
Go playing system
that has ever been created.

25:51.311 --> 25:54.245
Morris: Lee Sedol has about ten
minutes left on the clock.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.548
The game is slowly
nearing its end.

26:02.656 --> 26:04.923
I wonder if we have
a resignation here?

26:04.958 --> 26:06.690
Announcer: It could be
that Lee Sedol's resigned.

26:06.726 --> 26:09.093
Announcer 2: Yeah. I'm getting
word Lee has resigned.

26:09.128 --> 26:10.928
Wow.

26:10.963 --> 26:14.131
Morris: It's over.
Lee Sedol has lost.

26:14.166 --> 26:17.668
AlphaGo won four
out of five games.

26:17.703 --> 26:20.938
It is the champion Go player.

26:20.973 --> 26:23.607
<i>AlphaGo's big win
reinforced the idea</i>

26:23.642 --> 26:27.143
<i>that we may be on the brink of
transformative artificial intelligence,</i>

26:27.178 --> 26:29.278
<i>but some of the world's
most renowned thinkers</i>

26:29.313 --> 26:33.016
<i>are warning that there's a high
risk of unintended consequences.</i>

26:33.051 --> 26:36.318
The development of full
artificial intelligence

26:36.354 --> 26:38.888
could spell the end
of the human race.

26:38.923 --> 26:41.690
Elon Musk: <i> With artificial intelligence,
we are summoning the demon.</i>

26:41.725 --> 26:43.558
He's the guy with the pentagram
and the holy water,

26:43.593 --> 26:45.727
and he's like, "Yeah, you sure
you can control the demon?"

26:45.763 --> 26:47.029
I don't think it's inherent

26:47.064 --> 26:49.665
that as we create
super intelligence,

26:49.700 --> 26:51.833
that it will,
necessarily, always have

26:51.869 --> 26:54.102
the same goals
in mind that we do.

26:54.138 --> 26:57.205
Morris: <i>Oxford philosopher
Nick Bostrom,</i>

26:57.240 --> 26:59.306
<i>believes that the benefits
of super intelligence</i>

26:59.341 --> 27:02.043
<i>must be reconciled
with these risks.</i>

27:02.078 --> 27:03.878
Think of all the things that...

27:03.913 --> 27:07.815
the human species might have been able
to achieve in the fullness of time.

27:07.850 --> 27:09.884
Bostrom: <i>Maybe you would
have a cure for aging.</i>

27:09.919 --> 27:11.485
<i>Maybe you would
have space colonization,</i>

27:11.520 --> 27:13.287
<i>all these kinds of
science fiction-like things,</i>

27:13.322 --> 27:14.488
<i>but all of those
things, I think,</i>

27:14.523 --> 27:18.158
<i>might happen very quickly
done on digital timescales.</i>

27:18.193 --> 27:20.259
In the long-term, I think
we have an additional

27:20.295 --> 27:22.495
and very different and
distinct and unique problem.

27:22.530 --> 27:26.232
Which is, how could you ensure
that this super-intelligent system

27:26.267 --> 27:28.768
<i>will actually do what
you intended for it to do?</i>

27:28.804 --> 27:32.771
How could you control an intelligence
vastly greater than your own?

27:32.807 --> 27:34.973
Morris:
<i>There's always this concern</i>

27:35.009 --> 27:37.710
<i>of some kind of telescoping,
singularity situation</i>

27:37.745 --> 27:40.012
where a sufficiently
intelligent computer

27:40.047 --> 27:42.347
is able to build more
intelligent computers,

27:42.382 --> 27:45.718
which leads to some
kind of spiraling effect.

27:45.753 --> 27:50.221
I think if you ask most
AI researchers or experts,

27:50.256 --> 27:51.896
they'll probably give you
the same answer:

27:51.925 --> 27:56.327
That a lot of these more science fiction
scenarios are just that, science fiction.

27:56.362 --> 27:58.395
Most technologies, they're
kind of inherently neutral,

27:58.431 --> 28:02.200
but it depends on how society
uses them and deploys them

28:02.235 --> 28:06.502
that ends up determining whether they
end up being for good or for bad.

28:06.538 --> 28:08.071
Morris: <i>As researchers
work to balance</i>

28:08.107 --> 28:10.306
<i>AI's risks and possibilities,</i>

28:10.342 --> 28:14.377
<i>much of the science fiction of the
past is becoming today's reality,</i>

28:14.412 --> 28:16.947
<i>and the world's of artificial
intelligence and robotics</i>

28:16.982 --> 28:20.083
<i>are on track to achieve breakthroughs
in technology and science,</i>

28:20.119 --> 28:22.985
<i>that have never been
possible for humans before.</i>

28:23.020 --> 28:24.787
What I think is
the most important thing is

28:24.822 --> 28:28.124
to use AI to advance
science and medicine.

28:28.159 --> 28:30.192
<i>Things like diseases,</i>

28:30.228 --> 28:34.864
<i>climate, even things like
particle physics, macroeconomics.</i>

28:34.899 --> 28:38.067
<i>These are all hugely complex systems
now that we're trying to deal with</i>

28:38.102 --> 28:41.069
and we're trying to get
an understanding of.

28:41.104 --> 28:43.671
<i>I kind of dream about the day
when AI's good enough</i>

28:43.706 --> 28:47.008
<i>that we can have this idea
of AI scientists that work,</i>

28:47.043 --> 28:49.310
<i>hand-in-hand,
with human experts</i>

28:49.345 --> 28:51.545
to allow us to make
breakthroughs

28:51.581 --> 28:54.182
much faster than we're able
to at the moment.

28:54.217 --> 28:55.483
And do you think
that will happen soon?

28:55.518 --> 28:58.752
I think that could happen in
the next 20 years. Yeah, sure.
