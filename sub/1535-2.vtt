WEBVTT

00:03.123 --> 00:06.158
I recently read
that during World War Two,

00:06.160 --> 00:08.544
Joseph Stalin had
a research program

00:08.546 --> 00:10.162
to create
supersoldiers

00:10.164 --> 00:13.732
by having women
impregnated by gorillas.

00:14.651 --> 00:17.169
What a sick use
of science.

00:17.171 --> 00:19.421
Hey, as long as
the baby's healthy.

00:20.974 --> 00:23.142
I wonder if Stalin considered
any other animals.

00:23.144 --> 00:25.177
Hippos are
the deadliest creature.

00:25.179 --> 00:28.263
A half-human, half-hippo soldier
would be pretty badass.

00:29.482 --> 00:31.433
Yes, but when they're
hungry-hungry,

00:31.435 --> 00:33.352
you can stop them
with marbles.

00:34.688 --> 00:35.771
Yeah, the correct animal

00:35.773 --> 00:38.407
for interspecies supersolider
is koala.

00:38.409 --> 00:42.911
You would wind up with an army
so cute it couldn't be attacked.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.832
But half-man, half-owl
could fly...

00:46.834 --> 00:50.419
The answer is cuddly soldiers
with big flat noses. Moving on.

00:51.538 --> 00:53.088
So, Penny, when's
the new job start?

00:53.090 --> 00:54.289
Next Monday.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.758
Did you get a chance
to look over

00:55.760 --> 00:56.709
the materials I gave you?

00:56.711 --> 00:57.876
Uh, not yet,
but I will.

00:57.878 --> 01:00.095
Great. When?

01:00.097 --> 01:02.214
I said I'll get to it.

01:05.852 --> 01:09.004
I'm sensing awkwardness,
am I right?

01:09.006 --> 01:10.973
Yes.

01:10.975 --> 01:13.142
Swish.

01:14.060 --> 01:16.061
I don't want to be pushy,

01:16.063 --> 01:18.814
but you've never done
pharmaceutical sales before.

01:18.816 --> 01:21.233
It seems like you could use
this time to get a head start.

01:21.235 --> 01:22.735
Well, the first few
weeks will be all training.

01:22.737 --> 01:25.404
They'll tell me everything
I need to know.

01:25.406 --> 01:26.955
But imagine how impressed
they'd be if you showed up

01:26.957 --> 01:28.374
already familiar
with the material.

01:28.376 --> 01:30.909
Okay, so what, you want me
to be like a teacher's pet?

01:30.911 --> 01:33.045
Couldn't hurt.

01:33.047 --> 01:33.912
Mm, I don't know.

01:33.914 --> 01:35.664
Who here has ever been hurt

01:35.666 --> 01:37.416
because they were
the teacher's pet?

01:41.554 --> 01:43.922
It was like the rest of
the class <i> wanted</i> Ms. McDonald

02:16.383 --> 02:17.350
Mrs. Davis.

02:17.352 --> 02:19.452
Guess who?

02:19.454 --> 02:20.720
Dr. Cooper.

02:20.722 --> 02:22.888
That's right, good job.

02:23.740 --> 02:25.391
Hello.

02:25.393 --> 02:27.560
Uh, you wanted
to see me?

02:27.562 --> 02:29.178
Yes. Uh, welcome back.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.613
Thank you.

02:30.615 --> 02:33.232
I assume you'd like
to reopen our dialogue

02:33.234 --> 02:36.068
about the university forcing me
to continue with string theory?

02:36.070 --> 02:37.720
You mean the dialogue that went,

02:37.722 --> 02:41.207
"Please?" "No." "Please?" "No."
"Please?" "No."

02:42.109 --> 02:44.210
That's the one.

02:45.512 --> 02:48.831
I believe you went last,
so, uh, please?

02:48.833 --> 02:52.585
Dr. Cooper, while you were away,
we came up with a solution

02:52.587 --> 02:55.004
that would allow you to change
your field of study.

02:55.006 --> 02:56.756
Wow.

02:56.758 --> 02:59.892
Pouting and running away
actually worked.

03:00.794 --> 03:02.728
Yeah, I must say,
that may not be a lesson

03:02.730 --> 03:04.096
you want to reinforce with me.

03:05.732 --> 03:07.767
So, um, what is the solution?

03:07.769 --> 03:09.435
Currently, you're being paid
under a grant

03:09.437 --> 03:11.404
to specifically research
string theory.

03:11.406 --> 03:13.356
If we promote you
to junior professor,

03:13.358 --> 03:15.074
you'll be able to choose

03:15.076 --> 03:16.959
whatever field of research
you'd like.

03:18.311 --> 03:22.181
But if I'm a professor,
then I'll have to teach a class.

03:22.183 --> 03:23.649
That is correct.

03:24.951 --> 03:29.622
So your solution is to
promote me and pay me more money

03:29.624 --> 03:31.507
so that I can impart
my knowledge

03:31.509 --> 03:33.542
to the next generation
of scientists?

03:33.544 --> 03:34.910
Yes.

03:36.196 --> 03:38.297
You people are sick.

03:41.768 --> 03:43.352
Hey.

03:43.354 --> 03:44.720
Ready to go to lunch?

03:44.722 --> 03:46.055
Just give me a minute.

03:46.057 --> 03:47.440
I'm stimulating the pleasure
cells of this starfish.

03:47.442 --> 03:48.641
I just need to turn it off.

03:48.643 --> 03:50.609
What happens
if you don't?

03:50.611 --> 03:51.961
Then I have to sit through lunch

03:51.963 --> 03:54.647
knowing this starfish is
having a better day than I am.

03:55.732 --> 03:58.117
Is Bernadette meeting us
at the restaurant?

03:58.119 --> 04:01.053
Uh, no. Actually,
I didn't invite her.

04:01.055 --> 04:02.154
How come?

04:02.156 --> 04:04.323
Well, ever since she helped me
get this job,

04:04.325 --> 04:05.791
she won't stop bugging me.

04:05.793 --> 04:08.461
Well, I think she just wants you
to do well,

04:08.463 --> 04:09.745
and she's worried that you won't

04:09.747 --> 04:14.083
'cause you were just
a stunningly poor waitress.

04:14.085 --> 04:15.384
That is not true.

04:15.386 --> 04:17.103
I'm still waiting
on my mini corndogs

04:17.105 --> 04:19.221
from two years ago.

04:19.223 --> 04:22.775
I told you,
they'll be right out.

04:23.543 --> 04:26.228
Okay, so no
Bernadette.

04:26.230 --> 04:28.814
Well, you saw her the
other night. Am I wrong?

04:28.816 --> 04:30.015
No, I just...

04:30.017 --> 04:32.902
I feel kind of uncomfortable
talking about her like this.

04:32.904 --> 04:35.905
Usually when someone's being
talked about behind their back,

04:35.907 --> 04:38.691
it's me and it's right
in front of my face.

04:38.693 --> 04:41.827
I-I'm sorry. I just need
a little break from her.

04:41.829 --> 04:43.863
I understand.

04:43.865 --> 04:47.867
You know, there is
some research that indicates

04:47.869 --> 04:51.036
that sharing negative attitudes
about a third party

04:51.038 --> 04:54.173
can be a powerful bonding force
between two friends.

04:55.592 --> 04:57.042
So, what are
you saying?

04:57.044 --> 04:59.762
I'm saying,
in the spirit of science,

04:59.764 --> 05:02.181
what is
that little skank's problem?

05:05.685 --> 05:07.803
So, I've been trying
to come up

05:07.805 --> 05:09.722
with a cute couple's nickname
for me and Emily.

05:09.724 --> 05:11.390
What do you
like better--

05:11.392 --> 05:14.693
Emippali...

05:14.695 --> 05:17.229
or Koothrapemily?

05:17.231 --> 05:20.933
Why is it your last name
and her first name?

05:20.935 --> 05:22.902
Oh, well,
her last name is Sweeney,

05:22.904 --> 05:27.239
and something just didn't seem
right about Koothrapeeney.

05:29.075 --> 05:31.827
Hey, how'd it go
with human resources?

05:31.829 --> 05:33.245
Awful.

05:33.247 --> 05:35.581
Yeah, they're allowing me
to move on from string theory,

05:35.583 --> 05:37.500
but they made me
a junior professor

05:37.502 --> 05:39.802
and are requiring me
to teach a class.

05:39.804 --> 05:42.588
I don't understand. Why is it
bad that you have to teach?

05:42.590 --> 05:45.057
What a stupid question.

05:45.892 --> 05:49.428
The kids are
gonna love him.

05:49.430 --> 05:51.397
I can't believe
I have to waste my time

05:51.399 --> 05:53.566
babysitting a bunch
of grad students

05:53.568 --> 05:57.570
who probably think dark matter
is what's in their diapers.

05:57.572 --> 05:59.104
This might not be that bad.

05:59.106 --> 06:01.273
Uh, you like telling people
they're wrong.

06:01.275 --> 06:02.608
Wrong!

06:04.027 --> 06:07.112
Just because I enjoyed that one
doesn't mean I always do.

06:07.864 --> 06:09.665
You enjoy giving
people grades.

06:09.667 --> 06:13.786
A valid point,
but unoriginal-- B-minus.

06:13.788 --> 06:15.955
And you love the sound
of your own voice.

06:15.957 --> 06:17.706
Yeah, well, of course I do.

06:17.708 --> 06:18.841
Listen to it.

06:18.843 --> 06:22.127
It's like an earful
of melted caramel.

06:22.129 --> 06:24.346
Look, most importantly,

06:24.348 --> 06:27.216
this will let you move on
and study dark matter.

06:28.335 --> 06:31.136
It is true that many of
my heroes have taken students

06:31.138 --> 06:32.438
under their wings:

06:32.440 --> 06:35.774
Feynman, Einstein, Professor X.

06:35.776 --> 06:38.227
Humorously,

06:38.229 --> 06:39.728
in the case of Professor X,

06:39.730 --> 06:42.147
some of his students
actually had wings.

06:42.149 --> 06:44.400
That's rich.

06:45.635 --> 06:47.553
I'll use that one
to lighten the mood

06:47.555 --> 06:50.656
after my entire class
fails the midterm.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.379
Measuring starfish
serotonin levels in response

06:57.381 --> 07:01.500
to one point two molar
stimulation of pleasure cells.

07:03.270 --> 07:06.205
You like that, don't you?

07:06.207 --> 07:07.973
That's right, say my name.

07:11.696 --> 07:13.762
Hey.

07:13.764 --> 07:15.514
Hey, what's going on?
Not much.

07:15.516 --> 07:16.932
You want to get a drink later?

07:16.934 --> 07:18.150
Just the two of us?

07:18.152 --> 07:19.152
No Penny?

07:19.153 --> 07:20.235
Not tonight.

07:20.237 --> 07:21.437
I'm a little frustrated
with her.

07:21.439 --> 07:23.322
Because you got her the job
and you think

07:23.324 --> 07:25.190
she should be working harder
to prepare for it?

07:25.192 --> 07:28.861
So it's not just me.
You see it, too!

07:30.363 --> 07:33.365
I do, I see it.

07:33.367 --> 07:34.984
It's driving me crazy.

07:34.986 --> 07:36.835
Just this afternoon,
I saw on Instagram

07:36.837 --> 07:39.254
that instead of studying,
she went out to lunch

07:39.256 --> 07:41.006
and got a manicure.

07:41.908 --> 07:44.543
That's outrageous!

07:44.545 --> 07:45.711
I know!

07:45.713 --> 07:47.046
If she doesn't do well,

07:47.048 --> 07:49.665
Th-this could reflect poorly
on you.

07:49.667 --> 07:53.068
Exactly. Does she not realize it
or does she not care?

07:53.070 --> 07:54.286
I don't know.

07:54.288 --> 07:56.689
The important thing is
I am here for you

07:56.691 --> 08:00.893
so we can mutually disparage
this unpleasing third party.

08:06.116 --> 08:08.751
Hey. We just wanted to see

08:08.753 --> 08:10.486
how your class was going.
Where is everybody?

08:10.488 --> 08:13.038
There is no class.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.291
Did you send everyone to
the principal's office already?

08:17.827 --> 08:19.578
No one signed up.

08:19.580 --> 08:21.296
Well, that's not your fault.

08:21.298 --> 08:24.633
I called the department
secretary to see what happened.

08:24.635 --> 08:28.637
Apparently, I have a reputation
for being obnoxious.

08:29.472 --> 08:32.024
What?

08:32.976 --> 08:35.044
Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.

08:35.046 --> 08:37.062
No, it's fine.

08:37.063 --> 08:41.400
Now I can devote all my time
to dark matter.

08:41.402 --> 08:44.403
Aw, you brought cookies
for everyone?

08:44.405 --> 08:45.771
Oh, yes. Fig Newtons.

08:45.773 --> 08:48.524
which scientist both helped

08:48.526 --> 08:51.944
to develop calculus and had
a famous cookie named after him?

08:51.946 --> 08:53.412
And then after
someone said "Newton,"

08:53.414 --> 08:55.781
I was going to tell them
they're wrong.

08:57.267 --> 09:00.452
The cookies are named
after a town in Massachusetts.

09:00.454 --> 09:03.255
And then I'd throw
the cookies away.

09:04.874 --> 09:06.875
Hey, what if I took your class?

09:07.711 --> 09:09.795
Why would you do that?

09:09.797 --> 09:11.797
Yeah, why would you do that?
What's wrong with you?

09:12.348 --> 09:14.683
I'm thinking about
getting my doctorate,

09:14.685 --> 09:16.351
and he wants to teach-- why not?

09:16.353 --> 09:18.020
Oh, Howard.

09:18.022 --> 09:20.139
I appreciate
the gesture,

09:20.141 --> 09:22.808
but this is
a graduate-level physics class.

09:24.110 --> 09:25.811
I don't think you'd understand

09:25.813 --> 09:28.864
a single thing
I was talking about.

09:29.816 --> 09:32.701
Ask why not again;
I've got an answer.

09:32.703 --> 09:36.455
Sheldon, I'm more than smart
enough to take your class.

09:38.541 --> 09:40.576
No.

09:42.078 --> 09:43.295
Yes.

09:44.798 --> 09:46.882
How would you determine
the ground state

09:46.884 --> 09:50.002
of a quantum system
with no exact solution?

09:50.004 --> 09:52.471
I would guess a wave-function
and then vary its parameters

09:52.473 --> 09:54.306
until I found
the lowest energy solution.

09:54.308 --> 09:56.475
Hmm.

09:57.477 --> 10:00.062
Do you know how to integrate
X squared times E

10:00.064 --> 10:02.264
to the minus X,
without looking it up?

10:03.516 --> 10:04.566
I'd use Feynman's trick--

10:04.568 --> 10:06.001
differentiate
under the integral sign.

10:06.003 --> 10:08.353
Okay.

10:09.189 --> 10:10.689
Um...

10:10.691 --> 10:13.075
What is the correct
interpretation

10:13.077 --> 10:14.576
of quantum mechanics?

10:14.578 --> 10:16.578
Since every interpretation gives
exactly the same answer

10:16.580 --> 10:18.530
to every measurement,
they are all equally correct.

10:18.532 --> 10:20.866
However, I know you believe in
the Many Worlds Interpretation,

10:20.868 --> 10:23.502
so I'll say that. Now do you
think I'm smart enough?

10:26.673 --> 10:28.423
No.

10:29.876 --> 10:31.627
Oh, come on.
You might've gone to school

10:31.629 --> 10:33.679
for a couple more years than me,
but guess what--

10:33.681 --> 10:35.714
engineers are just
as smart as physicists.

10:35.716 --> 10:38.217
You take that back!

10:41.137 --> 10:43.856
No.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.074

10:52.083 --> 10:53.533
So, after drinks
with Bernadette,

10:53.535 --> 10:56.536
I get home, and Penny calls
to complain about her.

10:56.538 --> 10:58.171
And then while
I'm talking to Penny,

10:58.173 --> 10:59.589
I get a text from Bernadette.

10:59.591 --> 11:02.542
Wh... I'm trying to prepare
my lesson plan for Howard.

11:02.544 --> 11:05.595
Why are you
telling me this?

11:05.597 --> 11:09.716
Because it's taken 15 years, but
high school is finally awesome!

11:11.636 --> 11:13.387
I love them both,

11:13.389 --> 11:17.274
but I'm in the center now,
and I love that even more.

11:17.276 --> 11:20.060
Amy, please. I am trying
to figure out a way

11:20.062 --> 11:24.064
to intellectually emasculate
a dear friend of mine.

11:24.066 --> 11:26.366
But I'm just...
Not now.

11:26.368 --> 11:28.034
You better watch
that attitude, buddy.

11:28.036 --> 11:31.204
You're dating the
popular girl now.

11:34.242 --> 11:36.042
Hmm. You're up late.

11:36.044 --> 11:38.745
Oh, I'm working on
my lesson plan for Wolowitz.

11:38.747 --> 11:40.630
He is going to be so lost.

11:41.749 --> 11:43.667
Look at this section over here.

11:43.669 --> 11:47.003
Even I don't really
understand it.

11:47.005 --> 11:49.973
Sheldon, why are you doing this?

11:49.975 --> 11:51.725
I'm a teacher, Leonard.

11:51.727 --> 11:53.059
It's my job.

11:53.061 --> 11:54.928
No, I-I mean,

11:54.930 --> 11:56.763
why are you going
to so much trouble

11:56.765 --> 11:58.565
to prove that you're smarter
than Wolowitz?

11:58.567 --> 12:01.685
Oh, it's no trouble;
it's actually a pleasure.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.654
You want to know what I think?

12:04.656 --> 12:07.741
I think the idea that someone
could be as smart as you,

12:07.743 --> 12:10.327
or even smarter,
scares the pants off you,

12:10.329 --> 12:11.995
and you can't deal with it.

12:13.831 --> 12:15.665
Interesting point.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.534
Wh... You're
suggesting

12:17.536 --> 12:20.203
that I have emotional issues
below my consciousness

12:20.205 --> 12:21.855
which drive my behavior,

12:21.857 --> 12:24.841
thus causing me to lash out
at anything or anyone

12:24.843 --> 12:27.410
that threatens
my intellectual superiority.

12:27.412 --> 12:30.046
Might be something
to think about.

12:30.932 --> 12:32.299
Leonard?

12:32.301 --> 12:33.884
Yeah.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.552
Howard's allergic to peanuts.

12:35.554 --> 12:37.637
How can I use that against him?

12:41.609 --> 12:42.943
Hey.

12:42.945 --> 12:46.897
Okay, now that everyone's here,
we can begin.

12:48.649 --> 12:51.468
Before we do,
I just talked to Leonard.

12:51.470 --> 12:52.736
And if you're gonna

12:52.738 --> 12:55.322
spend all your time
trying to belittle me

12:55.324 --> 12:58.208
by making this class
unnecessarily hard,

12:58.210 --> 13:00.160
then I'm out.

13:00.162 --> 13:01.578
But if you're interested
in making

13:01.580 --> 13:04.331
a sincere effort
to be a good teacher,

13:04.333 --> 13:07.133
then I'm willing
to give this a shot.

13:09.670 --> 13:12.222
I suppose that's a fair request.

13:12.224 --> 13:15.675
There's no reason we both can't
benefit from this experience.

13:15.677 --> 13:17.244
Okay.

13:17.246 --> 13:19.312
Okay.

13:19.314 --> 13:21.014
Well, then, uh,
first things first.

13:21.016 --> 13:24.768
Um, are you familiar with
the Brachistochrone problem?

13:24.770 --> 13:26.236
I am.
Good.

13:26.238 --> 13:28.822
And how it relates
to the calculus of variations?

13:28.824 --> 13:30.190
It's an inverted cycloid.

13:30.192 --> 13:31.358
Wonderful.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.660
Now, what about
Euler-Lagrange theorems?

13:33.662 --> 13:34.995
That's where I'm a little fuzzy.

13:34.997 --> 13:37.030
Ha! I knew it! All right.

13:38.499 --> 13:41.535
We have a lot of information
to cover before your first test.

13:41.537 --> 13:44.371
Which, by the way,
is in eight minutes.

13:44.373 --> 13:47.007
The good news is I'm
grading on a curve,

13:47.009 --> 13:49.709
so you're pretty much
guaranteed a C.

13:51.513 --> 13:53.430

14:00.722 --> 14:02.472
then I'm gonna be
a crappy student.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.190

14:10.566 --> 14:12.032
This is not <i> American Bandstand.</i>

14:12.034 --> 14:12.983
Okay.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.067
Now, where was I?

14:14.069 --> 14:15.018
Let's see.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.036
Oh, yes. Over here.

14:16.038 --> 14:17.237
You...

14:18.706 --> 14:20.156
What are you doing now?

14:20.158 --> 14:21.975
Making a straw.

14:21.977 --> 14:23.026
Why?

14:23.028 --> 14:26.379
So I can shoot you
with a spitball.

14:27.665 --> 14:30.417
You're not going to do that,
and I'll tell you why.

14:30.419 --> 14:32.586
This is an institution
of higher learning,

14:32.588 --> 14:34.254
I am your professor,

14:34.256 --> 14:36.222
and you're going to treat me
with the prop...

14:41.562 --> 14:44.848
You shot your spit in my mouth!

14:45.683 --> 14:47.434
Is that gonna be on the test?

14:47.436 --> 14:49.686
Because I don't think
I can do that again.

14:52.406 --> 14:54.357
Hey, girlfriend.

14:54.359 --> 14:57.611
Can I get a what what?

14:57.613 --> 14:59.579
What?

15:00.414 --> 15:01.748
Close enough.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.417
Um, I was just calling to see
what you were up tonight.

15:04.419 --> 15:06.536
Thought maybe we could hit up
Color Me Mine,

15:06.538 --> 15:09.873
maybe sneak in
some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.791
Uh, thanks, but I think
I'm gonna stay in

15:11.793 --> 15:13.627
and go over the stuff
Bernadette gave me.

15:13.629 --> 15:15.578
Oh. Oh, I hear you.

15:15.580 --> 15:18.164
Try and get that nag
off your back, right?

15:19.367 --> 15:20.734
I mean, you're not a bicycle;

15:20.736 --> 15:23.219
why's she riding you like that?

15:23.221 --> 15:25.338
No, I think she was
just trying to help.

15:25.340 --> 15:28.108
Plus, I really want to do well
at this job. So...

15:28.110 --> 15:29.743
Okay, good luck.
And call me later,

15:29.745 --> 15:32.612
you know, if you decide
she's a bitch or something.

15:37.735 --> 15:39.819
Hey, girlfriend.

15:39.821 --> 15:41.271
Hey, Amy.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.656
Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine.

15:42.658 --> 15:46.826
Maybe we sneak in some Pinot--
make it Color Me <i> Wine.</i>

15:46.828 --> 15:49.129
That sounds fun,
but I promised Penny

15:49.131 --> 15:50.497
I'd come by and help her study.

15:50.499 --> 15:53.299
Oh. Well, good luck
getting her to do that.

15:53.301 --> 15:55.969
She's probably off
getting another manicure.

15:55.971 --> 15:57.637
You remember when she did that?

15:57.639 --> 15:59.956
You remember?

15:59.958 --> 16:02.175
I was probably being
too hard on her.

16:02.177 --> 16:03.476
We talked, we're good.

16:03.478 --> 16:05.095
Oh. Great.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.613
I'm happy for you guys.

16:06.615 --> 16:08.398
You know, when the two of you
aren't getting along,

16:08.400 --> 16:11.484
it puts me in a really
weird position.

16:11.486 --> 16:13.670
Well, don't worry--
everything's back to normal.

16:13.672 --> 16:16.773
You mean, like, where she's nice
to your face? Okay got it. Bye.

16:20.745 --> 16:22.846
Hey, boyfriend.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.364
Can't talk. Spitball.

16:24.366 --> 16:26.166
Probably gonna die.

16:33.007 --> 16:34.340
Well?

16:34.342 --> 16:36.209
Sheldon, I-I promise.

16:36.211 --> 16:39.512
Your uvula does not have an STD.

16:41.265 --> 16:43.349
Are you sure?

16:43.351 --> 16:47.387
It just doesn't feel as
innocent as it used to.

16:49.190 --> 16:51.608
You reported me
to human resources?

16:51.610 --> 16:55.562
You violated the sanctity
of my mouth.

16:55.564 --> 16:58.865
Well, I dropped your class,
so I hope you're happy.

16:58.867 --> 17:01.534
I told you you weren't
smart enough to take it.

17:01.536 --> 17:02.485
I'm smart enough, Sheldon.

17:02.487 --> 17:03.570
Asking me a bunch of questions

17:03.572 --> 17:04.788
about a topic
I'm not familiar with

17:04.790 --> 17:05.739
doesn't prove anything.

17:05.741 --> 17:06.906
I could do the same to you.

17:06.907 --> 17:08.374
Yeah... Try me.

17:08.376 --> 17:10.960
Okay.

17:10.962 --> 17:14.580
You enjoy making fun
of engineering so much;

17:14.583 --> 17:17.666
how do you quantify
the strength of materials?

17:17.669 --> 17:19.285
Young's modulus.

17:19.287 --> 17:20.854
Is that right?

17:20.856 --> 17:23.123
Yeah.

17:24.458 --> 17:28.060
Okay, how do you prevent
eddy currents in a transformer?

17:28.063 --> 17:30.313
Laminate the core material.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.397
Come on, give
him a hard one.

17:31.399 --> 17:33.266
That <i>was</i> a hard one.

17:34.435 --> 17:36.102
All right.

17:36.104 --> 17:39.689
How does the flow rate in a pipe
depend on its diameter?

17:40.941 --> 17:43.910
You don't know, do you?

17:45.997 --> 17:47.413
What's the matter, smart guy?

17:47.415 --> 17:49.749
Don't know Poiseuille's law?

17:55.422 --> 17:58.792
Thank goodness I got it!

18:01.245 --> 18:03.930
Now I can quit
checking my stool.

18:07.802 --> 18:10.553
Okay, what are the
potential side effects

18:10.555 --> 18:12.655
for our erectile
dysfunction drug?

18:12.657 --> 18:15.141
Headaches, dizziness and nausea.

18:15.143 --> 18:16.276
Yes.

18:16.278 --> 18:17.610
Those are also the side effects

18:17.612 --> 18:19.779
of having a 75-year-old man
with an erection

18:19.781 --> 18:21.481
climb on top of you.

18:21.483 --> 18:23.483
Want to stop here?

18:23.485 --> 18:24.818
Uh, no.
I can keep going.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.019
Nah, you got this.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.487
Let's go for a drink.
I'll call Amy.

18:27.489 --> 18:30.523
Okay, good. She seemed like she
really wanted to go out tonight.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.417
Hey, girl.

18:49.868 --> 18:53.904
Okay, next question,
for the Butterfinger:

18:53.906 --> 18:56.590
how long is a galactic yea

18:56.592 --> 18:57.908
250 million years!

18:57.910 --> 18:58.492
Yes!

19:01.414 --> 19:05.749
Okay, this one is
for a Cadbury Creme Egg.

19:05.751 --> 19:07.585
It's not even Easter time.

19:07.587 --> 19:09.753
This is crazy!

19:10.922 --> 19:15.226
Which Archimedean solid
has 20 regular triangular faces,

19:15.228 --> 19:17.828
30 square faces,
12 pentagonal faces,

19:17.830 --> 19:21.549
60 vertices and 120 edges?

19:21.551 --> 19:23.934
The Rhombicosidodecahedron!

19:23.936 --> 19:24.518
Yes!

19:27.240 --> 19:28.939
We are so smart!

19:28.941 --> 19:30.658
Why didn't girls like us
in high school?

19:30.660 --> 19:32.787
Because we were awkward and
weird and couldn't play sports!

19:32.811 --> 19:33.942
Right again!
