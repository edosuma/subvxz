WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.838
(SINGING) It seems today that all you see

00:04.922 --> 00:08.133
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.217 --> 00:11.845
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.929 --> 00:14.932
On which we used to rely?

00:15.015 --> 00:18.143
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.227 --> 00:21.355
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

00:21.438 --> 00:23.065
All the things that make us

00:23.148 --> 00:24.775
Laugh and cry!

00:24.858 --> 00:29.821
He's a family guy!

00:35.244 --> 00:37.454
Hey, fellows,
you all set for some paintball?

00:37.538 --> 00:38.747
You bet!

00:39.498 --> 00:42.709
God, Joe! Finally!
Is your watch paralyzed, too?

00:42.793 --> 00:44.503
Guys, I don't think I can make it today.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.964
It's looking like Bonnie might go
into labor any minute.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.966
So I think I should stick close to home.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.592
It's your fault for knocking her up.

00:50.676 --> 00:51.844
That's why I always use a condom.

00:51.927 --> 00:55.222
(LAUGHING)

00:55.305 --> 00:58.350
Sorry. I'm sorry. I can't even
say that with a straight face.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.769
Sorry, fellows, have a good time.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.062
Man, I am so sick of this.

01:02.145 --> 01:06.942
Joe is just gonna keep bailing on us until
that baby comes out of Bonnie's butt.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.653
-Babies come out of the butt, right?
-(HESITANTLY) Yeah.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.405
Well, we are gonna do something about it.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.615
We are gonna figure out a way
to induce labor

01:13.699 --> 01:15.117
and make Bonnie have that baby.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.870
Yeah, the sooner that kid comes out,
the sooner we get Joe back.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.705
Yeah, we're not complete without Joe.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.999
You remember when he bailed on us
for that trip to the spa

01:22.082 --> 01:24.001
and we had to find
another handicapped guy?

01:24.585 --> 01:27.796
God, Seamus.
I've never seen you this naked.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.841
(EXCLAIMS) It's good
to let the old midsection breathe.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.926
What... How the hell are you alive?

01:36.805 --> 01:38.140
Hi, Peter, how are you?

01:38.265 --> 01:41.476
Never mind that, Bonnie,
I'm here to induce birth. Follow me.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.023
Now, I'm gonna put the TV remote
down by your feet,

01:46.106 --> 01:47.858
and I'm gonna turn on Two and a Half Men.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.693
If your baby isn't totally brain-dead,

01:49.818 --> 01:51.612
it'll come rushing out
to change the channel.

01:51.695 --> 01:55.199
And when he does, I'll grab his hand
and yank him out of there.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.576
-Peter, I don't think...
-Shh. It's starting.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.249
It's Friday night and I don't have a date.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.170
Well, then, let me get you a number
from my little black book.

02:08.545 --> 02:09.922
(CHORTLES)

02:11.465 --> 02:13.759
All right, that didn't work,
so it's time for Plan B.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.929
Guys, let's go down to The Clam
and drink beer and watch sports.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.055
-Definitely.
-All right.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.850
-You in, Joe?
-Yes, awesome! That would be splendid.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.685
Yeah, this isn't working out.
All right, sorry,

02:23.769 --> 02:25.687
we'll pay you for the full day,
but you can go home.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.649
Damn right,
you're paying for the full day!

02:29.066 --> 02:32.819
Guys, Bonnie's going into labor!
We gotta get her to the hospital.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.279
Quick, Peter, get the car!

02:34.363 --> 02:36.907
No way, I don't want
a pregnant mess in my backseat.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.451
Oh, come on.
You're the guy who soiled his pants

02:39.535 --> 02:41.537
while test-driving that sports car.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.080
(TIRES SCREECH)

02:43.163 --> 02:44.456
I don't want it.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.546
All right, Mrs. Swanson.
You're doing fine.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.674
Hey, Peter, don't you want to watch this?
It's a beautiful miracle of nature.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.758
I can't look.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.344
I didn't look when Lois gave birth
and I can't look now.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.055
You can just tell me what it looks like.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.266
You ever see a horse blink his eye?

03:02.599 --> 03:04.726
Okay, Mrs. Swanson, you're almost there.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.019
Push! Push!

03:06.103 --> 03:09.398
Get out of there! Get the hell
out of my wife, you little bastard!

03:09.648 --> 03:11.567
(SCREAMING)

03:11.817 --> 03:13.110
Okay, here we go.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.904
Hold on, the wheelchair is coming first.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.781
And here's the baby.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.701
(WAILING)

03:20.951 --> 03:24.830
Congratulations, Mrs. Swanson,
it's a beautiful baby girl.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.416
Oh, Bonnie, I'm so happy for you!

03:27.541 --> 03:28.750
DOCTOR: Oh, my God! She's dying!

03:28.876 --> 03:29.877
-What?
-What?

03:29.960 --> 03:33.046
Oh, sorry, I was watching
this Paula Poundstone comedy special.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.132
Here's your baby.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.425
She's beautiful.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.803
-(SNIFFLING) Isn't she, sweetheart?
-She sure is, Joe.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.724
It's hard to believe she's already 18.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.813
Aw, Susie's so cute!

03:49.897 --> 03:51.481
I can't wait to have a baby someday.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.318
Oh, Meg, we've talked about this.

03:54.401 --> 03:58.238
In order to make a baby,
a man has to be able to become aroused.

03:58.322 --> 04:01.700
-Sorry, Dad, I forgot.
-That's all right, sweetie.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.160
Now you run along and play in the mud.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.539
Attention, everyone, this is a twist tie.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.499
It comes with every loaf of bread.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.543
When we are done
selecting our piece of bread,

04:11.627 --> 04:13.462
we use the tie to preserve...

-You don't say.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.600
What, like, you think
you have a shot with her?

04:26.683 --> 04:30.020
Are you kidding? We'll go together
better than Hannity and Colmes.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.855
My problem with liberals, Alan,

04:31.939 --> 04:33.732
is that liberals hate America.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.817
Sean, I don't know if that's true.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.445
You just contradicted me!
You hate America!

04:38.529 --> 04:40.113
If I could just get a word in...

04:40.197 --> 04:42.950
You hate America! You like the terrorists!

04:43.033 --> 04:45.285
Well, I guess you're right again.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.208
-Bonnie, we got a problem.
-What's the matter, Joe?

04:51.333 --> 04:53.252
I'll tell you
while we're doing the diaper change.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.879
Here's the reality of the situation.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.798
I got our hospital bill this morning.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.425
-How bad is it?
-It's $20,000.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.428
Oh, my God! Where are we going to get
that kind of money?

05:03.512 --> 05:05.639
I don't know,
but we've got to figure that out soon.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.600
Well, I'm not worried, Joe,
you'll think of something.

05:08.684 --> 05:09.685
I gotta tell you,

05:09.810 --> 05:12.187
not being able to pay
my child's hospital bills

05:12.271 --> 05:14.273
somehow makes me feel like

05:14.356 --> 05:17.651
-less of a man.
-Oh, honey, that's silly.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.279
I'm gonna show you
what a man you really are.

Are You Smarter than a Hispanic Maid?

05:31.290 --> 05:32.374
Okay, Larry, now,

05:32.457 --> 05:34.960
how does a Hispanic maid
address her employer

05:35.043 --> 05:36.795
if his name is John Sullivan?

05:36.879 --> 05:39.923
Is it A, John? Or B, Mr. Sullivan?

05:40.007 --> 05:42.009
Uh, I'm gonna go with Mr. Sullivan.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.135
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

05:43.218 --> 05:45.137

05:45.220 --> 05:47.431
Consuela, what would you say?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.516
-Mr. John.
-That's correct.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.644
Now, bonus question, is Mr. John home?

05:52.728 --> 05:56.148
No, no, Mr. John no home.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.152
Joe? What the hell? Are you working here?

06:00.235 --> 06:01.778
I have to, Quagmire.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.448
The baby's hospital bill
drained all our savings,

06:04.531 --> 06:06.533
so I've had no choice
but to take this job.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.410
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.705
Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing
you got yourself some money issues.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.626
-Uh, yeah, kind of.
-Well, I might be able to help you out.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.045
-How much you need?
-Look, I'm a police officer.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.714
I can't afford to get mixed up
with a loan shark.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.549
Hey, you should listen to this guy, Joe.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.635
He's flipping a nickel
and chewing on a toothpick.

06:27.846 --> 06:31.475
Well, I do really need the money.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.560
And I don't have the credit
for a bank loan.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.646
Do it, Joe, 'cause if you gotta
work here any longer,

we need another loan shark.

was a really good idea.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.166
It's selling really well.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.835
That's because
it has my secret ingredient in it.

(SLURRING) You know what we should do?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.716
You know what we should do?
We should just...

08:27.799 --> 08:30.594
We should just get on our bikes
and just go.

Just go and start a business.

we've been out here all day

and we haven't managed to interest
a single woman in our massage parlor.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.324

08:52.407 --> 08:54.159
Excuse me, stressed-out lady.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.287
May I interest you in
a full-release relaxation massage?

08:57.371 --> 08:58.664
Oh, yeah, just what I need,

and our feelings are hurt.

So that's pretty much it,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Joe's getting desperate,
and we haven't raised nearly enough.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.225

09:18.433 --> 09:20.060
Of course, I could.

09:59.975 --> 10:03.562
Then you poke your head out of the door
with a C chord

10:03.687 --> 10:05.731
Everything looks okay out here

10:05.814 --> 10:08.066
Maybe I'll take a walk outside

10:08.192 --> 10:10.110
To the D chord

10:10.194 --> 10:12.321
Oh, walking around outside

10:12.404 --> 10:14.364
Look at all the stuff out here

10:14.489 --> 10:17.284
And then we go to an A minor

10:17.367 --> 10:19.578
Getting a little cloudy out here

10:19.661 --> 10:21.830
Looking like we might have some weather

10:21.914 --> 10:24.625
Then we go to E minor

10:24.708 --> 10:26.126
Oh, definitely got some weather

10:26.210 --> 10:29.254
Things are a little more complicated
than they seemed at first

10:29.338 --> 10:31.381
And then we go back to my house

10:31.465 --> 10:33.342
You sound like an unbelievable douche.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.677
Then Brian comes in

10:35.761 --> 10:38.013
And I change up the tempo

10:38.096 --> 10:41.767
Brian comes in and he changes the song

10:41.850 --> 10:45.229
Looking at me
like he thinks I'm a douchebag

10:45.312 --> 10:48.440
But he's gonna learn pretty fast
that he's wrong

10:48.524 --> 10:52.569
Hey, Brian
Why are you bringing me down, man?

10:52.653 --> 10:54.821
Why are you bringing me down?

10:54.905 --> 10:56.573
Don't bring me down

10:56.657 --> 10:58.367
Music and lyrics by Stewie Griffin.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.748
Hey, Swanson,
the boss is getting impatient.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.083
He wants his money.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.169
He says after we're done with you,
you're gonna be eating...

11:10.003 --> 11:12.548
Swanson TV... TV... Wait.

11:12.631 --> 11:13.799
-Wait, what did he say?
-What?

11:13.882 --> 11:15.384
What did the boss say?
He said something funny,

11:15.467 --> 11:17.344
and now I'm drawing a blank
on what it was.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.804
-Oh, you know what it was?
-What?

11:18.887 --> 11:20.013
You know what it was?

11:20.097 --> 11:23.767
"When we're done with him,
he's gonna be a Swanson TV Dinner."

11:23.851 --> 11:24.935
(CHUCKLING)

11:25.602 --> 11:27.104
That is pretty funny.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.358
Look what they did to me.
My legs are useless now.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.860
(MUFFLED LAUGHTER)

11:33.235 --> 11:35.070
And trust me, they'll be back.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.906
-Well, what are we gonna do?
-You know what, boys?

11:37.990 --> 11:40.534
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.662
If that stingy old Carter
won't give us the money we need,

11:43.745 --> 11:45.581
I say we take it from him.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.709
Guys, we are gonna plan a robbery.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.835
(DOORBELL RINGS)

11:52.087 --> 11:54.548
(DRUNKENLY) Hey, hey, that's the guy.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.217
That's the guy whose chin

11:57.301 --> 11:59.970
looks like a... Balls.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.566
All right, on a normal night
in the Pewterschmidt mansion,

12:12.649 --> 12:15.527
there might be as much as $6 million
in the vault alone.

12:15.611 --> 12:17.988
But this Saturday is
the Pewterschmidts' annual

12:18.071 --> 12:21.116
"Bring all your cash
and put it in our safe" party.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.786
Considering the guest list,
there could be as much as $40 million.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.872
But we only need $20,000.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.499
(SIGHS) All right, look,
I'll be honest with you.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.753
My father-in-law has treated me like crap
for almost 20 years,

12:32.836 --> 12:34.338
and it's time for a little payback.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.382
$40 million! That's $10 million each!

12:37.466 --> 12:39.760
I could afford to produce a movie
with B+ stars

12:39.885 --> 12:41.637
in a not-so-expensive location.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.139
ANNOUNCER: Jeff Bridges
and Laura Linney

12:44.223 --> 12:46.558
in Danger In Cincinnati.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.268
We've got 24 hours

12:48.352 --> 12:50.687
before those terrorists set off
that new type of bomb

12:50.771 --> 12:53.398
-that makes an invisible explosion.
-What are we gonna do?

12:53.524 --> 12:54.733
Let's get back to headquarters.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.027
-Should we take the helicopter?
-No, let's...

12:57.110 --> 12:58.654
Let's walk, it's a nice day.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.408
Oh, there's my laptop.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.702
-Do you mind? I want to check my e-mail.
-Go away!

13:05.786 --> 13:08.288
I'm editing this music video
I'm making for Susie.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.916
Oh, really? Music video?

13:11.041 --> 13:12.793
Working on a little video there?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.127
Little, uh...

13:14.211 --> 13:15.754
(VOICE RISING IN PITCH)
Little music video?

13:15.838 --> 13:19.216
Little compilation of visual images
to go with a song?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.635
Little four-minute movie
that tells the story...

13:21.760 --> 13:23.470
Yeah, that only works when I do it.

13:23.554 --> 13:24.721
There, all done.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.724
All right, Brian, get ready to feel.

13:50.789 --> 13:57.045
There's nothing there to hide

13:57.588 --> 14:00.716
Take me as I am

14:00.799 --> 14:04.511
Take my life

14:05.387 --> 14:08.390
I would give it all

14:08.473 --> 14:12.561
I would sacrifice

14:12.644 --> 14:18.525
Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for

14:19.610 --> 14:21.945
I can't help it

14:22.029 --> 14:26.366
There's nothing I want more

14:26.491 --> 14:30.162
You know it's true

14:30.245 --> 14:33.665
Everything I do

14:33.749 --> 14:38.003
I do it for you

14:38.086 --> 14:39.463
Oh, yeah

14:41.215 --> 14:44.635
There's no love

14:44.760 --> 14:48.347
Like your love

14:48.430 --> 14:51.975
And no other

14:52.059 --> 14:55.646
Could give more love

14:55.729 --> 14:59.316
There's nowhere

14:59.399 --> 15:02.945
Unless you're there

15:03.070 --> 15:06.657
All the time

15:06.740 --> 15:12.371
All the way

the story arc here.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.417
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

15:22.881 --> 15:25.717
Look into your heart, babe

15:42.067 --> 15:45.445
Oh, you can't tell me

15:45.529 --> 15:49.408
It's not worth trying for

15:50.242 --> 15:52.703
I can't help it

15:52.786 --> 15:56.957
There's nothing I want more

15:57.040 --> 16:01.503
Yeah, I would fight for you

16:01.628 --> 16:04.798
I'd lie for you

16:04.882 --> 16:08.051
Walk the wire for you

16:08.135 --> 16:13.765
Yeah, I'd die for you

Everything I do

16:22.482 --> 16:25.569
Oh

16:26.445 --> 16:32.201
I do it for you

16:34.286 --> 16:37.456
Don't worry, Brian. Those goose bumps
will go away in about 20 minutes.

16:37.539 --> 16:41.502
Stewie, that is the worst thing
I have ever seen, ever.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.921
And I've seen Peter
when he's frozen in sex-face.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.800
Peter, would you like more potatoes?

program my Zune?

17:53.365 --> 17:55.158

from out of this world

have to cut through it.

to talk some sense into you.

to go through with this?
