WEBVTT

00:03.697 --> 00:05.530
This part is really scary.

00:05.564 --> 00:08.399
Please. Vampires? What else ya got?

00:08.435 --> 00:10.535
Hey, guys.

00:10.570 --> 00:12.737
Sorry. I need serious help.

00:12.772 --> 00:14.739
Based on that look, I agree.

00:14.774 --> 00:17.842
I was hoping to go low-key
with my Easter bonnet this year.

00:17.877 --> 00:20.511
Is this too much?

00:20.547 --> 00:23.614
How does your neck even hold that up?

00:23.650 --> 00:25.750
We're not really
an Easter bonnet family.

00:25.785 --> 00:27.719
But we do all the other traditions.

00:27.754 --> 00:29.587
Candy baskets, egg hunts,

00:29.622 --> 00:31.422
big ham dinners, right?

00:31.458 --> 00:33.524
We do? All I remember

00:33.560 --> 00:35.593
is being off from school for a week,

00:35.628 --> 00:38.563
and going out to dinner,
but the taco place was closed.

00:38.598 --> 00:40.698
That's all you do?

00:40.734 --> 00:42.767
Finally!

00:42.802 --> 00:44.535
A day that's more fun at my house.

00:44.571 --> 00:46.471
Wow.

00:46.506 --> 00:48.806
We really let Easter slide.

00:51.544 --> 00:52.777
Family traditions are easy

00:52.812 --> 00:54.746
when you only have a couple of kids.

00:54.781 --> 00:56.781
But with seven,
it's hard enough for Mom and Dad

00:56.816 --> 00:58.783
to get us all to brush our teeth,

00:58.818 --> 01:01.486
let alone pull off
a big holiday celebration.

01:01.521 --> 01:03.521
<i>Check it out... the Easter baskets</i>

01:03.556 --> 01:05.522
<i>when there were only two kids,</i>

01:05.558 --> 01:06.858
<i>four kids,</i>

01:06.893 --> 01:08.793
<i>six kids,</i>

01:08.828 --> 01:10.561
<i>and by the last kid...</i>

01:12.565 --> 01:13.831
Oh. Must be Easter.

01:15.468 --> 01:18.803
I hate to inform you,
but we've lost Easter.

01:18.838 --> 01:20.872
This sounds important enough
to stop pretending

01:20.907 --> 01:23.441
like we know how to fold a fitted sheet.

01:23.476 --> 01:24.642
Go on.

01:24.677 --> 01:26.677
Easter has gone the way
of writing thank-you notes,

01:26.713 --> 01:29.881
washing our hands, or eating vegetables.

01:29.916 --> 01:32.550
At some point, it just got away from us.

01:32.585 --> 01:34.652
For your information,
I had a radish last night.

01:34.687 --> 01:36.821
It was an accident, but I ate it.

01:36.856 --> 01:39.891
It's been so long since we've
had a traditional Diaz Easter,

01:39.926 --> 01:42.460
Daphne can't even
remember what it's like.

01:42.495 --> 01:44.729
What? I could've sworn just last year,

01:44.764 --> 01:46.531
I put out six little Easter baskets.

01:46.566 --> 01:47.632
There's seven of us.

01:47.667 --> 01:48.900
Wow, it has been a while.

01:48.935 --> 01:51.636
Okay, so this year,

01:51.671 --> 01:53.805
when Easter rolls around,
we'll do it up big,

01:53.840 --> 01:55.473
with all the Diaz bells and whistles.

01:55.508 --> 01:57.642
Great, because Easter is tomorrow.

01:58.745 --> 02:00.812
Oh. Well, there's always next year.

02:00.847 --> 02:02.547
No, Tom, she's right.

02:02.582 --> 02:03.848
Without family traditions,

02:03.883 --> 02:05.783
we are just a bunch of people

02:05.819 --> 02:08.853
living together,
fighting over the remote.

02:08.888 --> 02:11.456
Grocery store, here I come.

02:12.859 --> 02:16.494
- Right after I re-wash this sheet.
- Yeah.

02:18.665 --> 02:22.567
It's the morning of
Daphne's first real Easter.

02:22.602 --> 02:24.569
Downstairs will be all decorated.

02:24.604 --> 02:26.838
Our table will have
Easter baskets for everyone.

02:26.873 --> 02:28.840
Even you. Well, maybe not you.

02:28.875 --> 02:31.742
We have a lot of people here.

02:32.779 --> 02:35.513
Daphne. It's Easter.

02:35.548 --> 02:37.815
Just slide the egg through the door.

02:37.851 --> 02:39.584
Deathne and I had a late night.

02:39.619 --> 02:42.587
Oh, we are way past napkin chocolate.

02:42.622 --> 02:43.754
Wake up, everyone.

02:43.790 --> 02:46.457
Diaz Easter is back!

02:54.501 --> 02:56.434
What am I looking at here?

02:56.469 --> 02:58.603
Apparently, a table full of lies.

02:58.638 --> 02:59.904
This is even worse than last year.

02:59.939 --> 03:01.873
Yeah, last year, we got to sleep in.

03:01.908 --> 03:03.674
There's supposed to be baskets.

03:03.710 --> 03:05.576
And not just one filled with laundry.

03:05.612 --> 03:06.844
Mom didn't put the baskets out,

03:06.880 --> 03:09.514
so the Easter bunny didn't come.

03:09.549 --> 03:11.449
Does this mean we're
off his list for good?

03:11.484 --> 03:12.650
I'm going back to bed.

03:12.685 --> 03:14.585
If a chocolate egg shows up,

03:14.621 --> 03:16.454
leave it at my door.

04:14.340 --> 04:16.613
Mom, what happened?

04:16.649 --> 04:18.783
We are on the verge of
losing the one holiday

04:18.810 --> 04:20.672
where you get to eat
chocolate for breakfast.

04:20.697 --> 04:24.021
Oh, I guess this cold
is worse than I thought.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.991
I slept straight through
putting out the Easter baskets.

04:27.026 --> 04:29.894
If only there was another
parent who could've stepped in.

04:29.929 --> 04:32.830
You guys have seen me
with the Christmas tree lights.

04:32.865 --> 04:35.599
Nobody wants me hanging Easter grass.

04:35.635 --> 04:36.934
You don't hang Easter grass.

04:36.969 --> 04:38.068
Ah. I rest my case.

04:38.104 --> 04:40.871
I'm sorry we let Daphne down.

04:40.907 --> 04:42.740
That's not true, Mom.

04:42.775 --> 04:44.909
You let down all of us.

04:44.944 --> 04:47.645
All right, there's
more to Easter than candy.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.680
Like, uh...

04:49.715 --> 04:51.749
- Oh, like, uh...
- Church?

04:51.784 --> 04:53.884
- Yeah.
- See? Tradition.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.886
All right, everyone get
in your Sunday best.

04:55.922 --> 05:00.691
- Can I go like this?
- Um...

05:00.726 --> 05:04.562
God may forgive you, but I won't.

05:04.597 --> 05:06.730
Snubbed by the Easter bunny.

05:06.766 --> 05:08.666
This is a new low.

05:08.701 --> 05:09.934
Okay, we had a misfire with the baskets,

05:09.969 --> 05:12.670
but there's a reason why
Easter's in spring.

05:12.705 --> 05:13.971
It's about new beginnings.

05:14.006 --> 05:15.806
And miracles.

05:15.842 --> 05:17.741
We're actually gonna need both.

05:17.777 --> 05:20.611
Wait until you taste
Mom's delicious ham dinner.

05:20.646 --> 05:22.012
It's ham-tastic.

05:22.048 --> 05:23.948
Hammer-iffic. Hammer time.

05:23.983 --> 05:25.616
I'll keep working on it.

05:25.651 --> 05:27.985
Mmm. I can almost smell that ham now.

05:28.020 --> 05:29.687
I smell something.

05:29.722 --> 05:31.689
Something awful.

05:33.726 --> 05:35.926
Maybe it's this rotten ham
rolling around on the floor.

05:37.997 --> 05:40.030
I'm gonna say
that's the leading candidate.

05:40.066 --> 05:44.668
Gross! The fact that none of
us even noticed this until now

05:44.704 --> 05:47.638
means we have to have a serious
conversation about this car.

05:47.673 --> 05:49.840
I would love to blame
that one on your mom,

05:49.876 --> 05:52.810
but my job was carrying in the bags.

05:52.845 --> 05:55.646
And I'm guessing this bread
with the footprint on it

05:55.681 --> 05:57.014
is on you, too.

05:57.049 --> 06:00.985
Be honest. Have you guys ever
celebrated Easter before?

06:08.060 --> 06:09.927
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Harley.

06:09.962 --> 06:11.929
- We're gonna squeeze in.
- Okay.

06:11.964 --> 06:14.632
Oh, sorry.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.600
We have a lot of people.

06:16.636 --> 06:19.003
Oh, was that your hair?
Sorry. Peace be with you.

06:23.876 --> 06:26.043
Sure, we missed the candy basket part,

06:26.078 --> 06:27.811
but get the "sit on a hard bench

06:27.847 --> 06:30.614
in uncomfortable clothes" part.

06:30.650 --> 06:33.617
Look at you, handling
your stable of children alone,

06:33.653 --> 06:35.653
when it's normally
so hard with two of you.

06:35.688 --> 06:38.822
You're in church, Tom. You're in church.

06:38.858 --> 06:41.792
Suzy came down with a little cold.

06:41.827 --> 06:43.961
Oh. So you're all carriers.

06:43.996 --> 06:46.897
Ellie, hands.

06:46.933 --> 06:49.900
Don't worry. I got it all under control.

06:49.936 --> 06:52.903
You won't even know the Diazes are here.

Hello.

07:10.990 --> 07:12.856
What are you...?

07:12.892 --> 07:14.892
If anything on that hat is candy,

07:14.927 --> 07:17.995
would you be willing to
trade it for a whole Easter ham?

07:18.030 --> 07:19.997
It's right in the car.
It's right in the car.

07:20.032 --> 07:21.632
A whole Easter ham.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.934
Would you be willing to trade?

07:23.970 --> 07:26.003
Bad news. Problem at the store.

07:26.038 --> 07:28.739
Ethan, I'll need some help. Come with.

07:28.774 --> 07:30.841
Yes! I mean...

07:30.876 --> 07:33.744
Aww. I'm gonna miss
all this great church.

07:33.779 --> 07:35.913
Seriously? In the middle of service?

07:35.948 --> 07:37.848
The deli fridge went kablooey.

07:37.883 --> 07:39.650
I can't have my car and my store

07:39.685 --> 07:40.784
smell like rotten ham.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.686
You guys can walk home from church.

07:42.722 --> 07:43.988
It's just a couple of blocks.

07:44.023 --> 07:46.790
You expect me to walk
home in these shoes?

07:46.826 --> 07:48.025
Would you rather help me
scrape out old shrimp

07:48.060 --> 07:49.927
from the deli fridge?

07:49.962 --> 07:52.863
I'm sorry. What? I stopped
listening at "help me."

07:58.637 --> 08:01.672
Was this the Easter magic
you were talking about?

08:01.707 --> 08:03.774
Okay, we're three men down for church.

08:03.809 --> 08:06.677
We still have more people here
than most families. Go, Diazes.

08:06.712 --> 08:08.645
Go, Diazes.

08:08.681 --> 08:10.014
If only they would.

08:10.049 --> 08:12.016
Solid church, everybody.

08:12.051 --> 08:14.685
Standing, sitting, all top notch.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.955
Harley, as someone who
shot up a lot of air balls,

08:17.990 --> 08:20.958
I can tell you we are nowhere
near the rim on this holiday.

08:20.993 --> 08:23.861
Not true. Daphne, what do
you say we head home,

08:23.896 --> 08:26.864
- and keep this Easter train rolling?
- I think this is my stop.

08:26.899 --> 08:29.700
- What?
- I'm the youngest.

08:29.735 --> 08:32.602
Last in line for everything.

08:32.638 --> 08:35.039
Toys, clothes, memories.

08:35.073 --> 08:37.808
It would've been nice
to get a Diaz Easter,

08:37.842 --> 08:40.677
but it's not gonna happen.

08:40.712 --> 08:42.880
Thanks for trying.

08:42.914 --> 08:46.617
I'm gonna see if anything
tasty fell off of Ellie's hat.

08:51.624 --> 08:54.792
Hey, we were able to do
church as a family.

08:54.827 --> 08:57.027
Well, except for Mom, Dad and Ethan.

08:57.063 --> 08:59.029
I'm going over to Phoebe's for dinner.

08:59.065 --> 09:00.798
They're having Chinese.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.766
Maybe I'll get a good Easter fortune.

09:02.802 --> 09:03.934
Can you bring me home an eggroll?

09:03.969 --> 09:05.969
At least it has the word "egg" in it.

09:06.005 --> 09:09.840
Guys, we can't give up on Easter.

09:09.875 --> 09:13.010
Not just for Daphne's sake;
because it's a slippery slope.

09:13.045 --> 09:15.846
Take the big fireworks display
Dad used to set off

09:15.881 --> 09:18.882
on Fourth of July. Do I need
to remind you of last year?

09:23.055 --> 09:24.988
When is it my turn?

09:27.726 --> 09:29.626
And do you two remember doing

09:29.662 --> 09:30.994
the annual Diaz St. Patrick's Day

09:31.030 --> 09:32.863
jig/corned beef eat-a-thon?

09:32.898 --> 09:34.832
- That was a thing?
- It was.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.800
It's like what happened
to Flag Day fajitas.

09:36.869 --> 09:39.036
What? We never...

09:39.071 --> 09:41.939
Hey, that one didn't even make it to me.

09:43.609 --> 09:45.676
We have to save Easter.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.811
If we don't, the next thing
on the chopping block

09:47.847 --> 09:49.913
is Christmas.

09:49.949 --> 09:51.915
The girl's right. We can't
let it get to that.

09:51.951 --> 09:54.885
If Mom and Dad can't do it,
we've gotta step up.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.887
You're right. You and I
will figure out dinner.

09:56.922 --> 10:00.023
I'm good at putting makeup on things.
I'll decorate the eggs.

10:00.059 --> 10:02.626
- We'll fill Easter baskets.
- That's a given.

10:02.661 --> 10:04.862
As a candy-related activity,
we pull rank here.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.931
Great. We're going to replace
those Easters

10:07.967 --> 10:10.667
Daphne can't remember
with ones she'll never forget.

10:10.703 --> 10:11.935
On three.

10:11.971 --> 10:15.639
One, two, three, Diaz Easter!

10:15.674 --> 10:17.007
- Sh!
- Sorry.

10:21.847 --> 10:25.716
Guys? Guys!

10:25.751 --> 10:28.685
I know I'm the youngest, but come on.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:38.822 --> 10:41.022
Please kneel.

10:42.803 --> 10:44.936
You may be seated.

10:44.961 --> 10:48.730
I like this. It's basically Simon Says.

10:48.765 --> 10:50.765
All rise.

10:52.669 --> 10:54.903
Hey. You get left behind, too?

10:54.938 --> 10:56.938
No. My mom's running the church dinner

10:56.973 --> 10:58.740
for the less fortunate,

10:58.775 --> 11:00.752
and she wants me to help organize it.

11:00.777 --> 11:03.378
I'm trying to put on my leader face.

11:04.614 --> 11:06.781
I recommend you keep trying.

11:06.817 --> 11:09.351
Ellie.

11:09.386 --> 11:11.486
Time to motivate some volunteers.

11:11.521 --> 11:12.754
I hope you're ready... Oh.

11:12.789 --> 11:15.390
Oh, it appears we have a stray Diaz.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.359
Were you left behind by accident,

11:17.394 --> 11:18.727
or on purpose?

11:18.762 --> 11:22.430
Has to be the first one.
I'm the best kid they got.

11:22.466 --> 11:25.433
I'll get a hold of your mother.

11:29.506 --> 11:30.772
Ugh. Sorry, Bethany.

11:30.807 --> 11:32.774
I'm too sick to listen to

11:32.809 --> 11:34.709
whatever you wanna complain about.

11:34.745 --> 11:36.778
Just an hour, and I'll be fine.

11:39.483 --> 11:42.484
All right, so I've got
the bread, the lettuce...

11:42.519 --> 11:44.719
Two seconds more than I thought I'd get.

11:46.656 --> 11:49.591
This is how I learned how to fix stuff.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.826
By watching my dad when I was a kid.

11:51.862 --> 11:54.562
Hey, you're not even paying attention.

11:54.598 --> 11:56.398
I am... to the internet.

11:56.433 --> 11:57.766
This do-it-yourself guy is working on

11:57.801 --> 11:59.701
the same fridge you have.

11:59.736 --> 12:02.537
Pfft. What does that guy know
that your old man doesn't?

12:04.374 --> 12:09.511
He knows that that thing
you connected here

12:09.546 --> 12:11.446
should be connected there.

12:15.452 --> 12:16.451
Mm-hmm.

12:17.721 --> 12:20.388
Whoa, that's amazing.

12:20.424 --> 12:22.657
What else can those internet guys do?

12:22.692 --> 12:26.394
Um, how about fixing an outboard
motor in five easy steps?

12:26.430 --> 12:28.430
Sweet, 'cause I got one in the back

12:28.465 --> 12:30.698
that I broke in one easy step.
I'll get my tools.

12:30.734 --> 12:32.567
That's the first step.

12:32.602 --> 12:33.802
Ooh, this guy is good.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.603
Yeah.

12:35.639 --> 12:38.440
Mrs. Peters is calling.

12:38.475 --> 12:40.442
Ooh, Bethany. Press "ignore."

12:40.477 --> 12:42.544
If only it were that easy in real life.

12:44.714 --> 12:46.748
You guys still doing Easter for Daphne?

12:46.783 --> 12:49.517
That's so nice.

12:49.553 --> 12:50.618
How can I help?

12:50.654 --> 12:52.487
You already have.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.656
Here's your credit card.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.824
I took it last night
for school supplies.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.726
I needed a new top for science class.

12:58.762 --> 13:00.428
This ham's good to go.

13:00.464 --> 13:02.397
It only touched the sidewalk once.

13:02.432 --> 13:06.301
Don't worry, Mom. We're here
to make your life easier.

13:06.336 --> 13:09.704
Oh, perfect. I can use this for my eggs.

13:09.739 --> 13:13.308
Who needs tea? Okay.

13:13.343 --> 13:14.442
Nap time.

13:19.349 --> 13:21.483
Mom!

13:22.752 --> 13:25.687
Easter bunny hit that store hard, Mom.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.323
The candy aisles were cleaned out.

13:28.358 --> 13:30.425
It was down to
cough drops and breath mints.

13:30.460 --> 13:32.760
Did you get them, 'cause I
could use a cough drop,

13:32.796 --> 13:35.363
and you guys could really
use a breath mint.

13:36.433 --> 13:38.533
But we still have one more option.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.602
If something works on one holiday,

13:40.637 --> 13:42.570
why not try it on the other?

13:47.444 --> 13:48.810
Trick or treaster!

13:48.845 --> 13:52.380
We'll take chocolate bunnies,
jelly beans, sugar packets.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.350
Really anything in the sugar pyramid.

14:00.390 --> 14:01.756
Well, I guess until your parents
realize you're missing,

14:01.791 --> 14:03.691
you're here with me.

14:03.727 --> 14:05.493
Honestly, it's the best thing that
could've ever happened to you.

14:05.529 --> 14:07.629
Can I get a bike then, Mommy?

14:07.664 --> 14:09.397
Ah, worth a shot.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.300
Ellie, your job is to make sure

14:12.335 --> 14:13.601
everything on this list gets done.

14:13.637 --> 14:15.737
- So put your leader face on.
- I was.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.507
This is it.

14:19.543 --> 14:21.643
Oh, boy.

14:21.678 --> 14:22.744
Just start getting the volunteers

14:22.779 --> 14:24.746
to put more chairs around the tables.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.682
And you just stay back and try
not to bite anyone's leg.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.589
Excuse me.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.758
Would you mind putting
more chairs around the table?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.360
Two would be great,
when you get a chance.

14:40.564 --> 14:43.498
Or we could start
with one and see how it goes.

14:43.533 --> 14:45.533
I don't think they wanna help.

14:45.569 --> 14:47.702
If you can't rally a bunch of priests,

14:47.737 --> 14:49.771
nuns and volunteers,

14:49.806 --> 14:51.739
that's a you problem.

14:51.775 --> 14:53.608
You're right.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.476
I've gotta be tougher.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.555
I'll give 'em a half
hour, then try again.

15:07.591 --> 15:09.591
Allow me.

15:11.695 --> 15:13.361
Yo, people. Listen up.

15:13.396 --> 15:14.696
We got work to do.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.734
How did you do that?

15:19.769 --> 15:21.769
Big family. You don't speak up,

15:21.805 --> 15:23.571
you don't eat.

15:23.607 --> 15:25.740
Maybe you should take this.

15:25.775 --> 15:27.508
I was taking it anyway.

15:32.716 --> 15:35.450
Okay, our Easter has started shaky,

15:35.485 --> 15:37.552
but shaky starts are also
a Diaz tradition.

15:37.587 --> 15:40.388
I have full faith we can pull this off,

15:40.423 --> 15:42.390
and give Daphne the perfect Easter.

15:42.425 --> 15:44.492
Because when you work
together as a family,

15:44.527 --> 15:47.495
you end up with
the sweet smell of success.

15:47.530 --> 15:50.665
Which really smells like that time

15:50.700 --> 15:53.668
Rachel tried to dry
rain boots in the microwave.

15:53.703 --> 15:56.337
Hey, Georgie, have you
checked on the ham lately?

16:00.777 --> 16:03.444
What happened?

16:05.415 --> 16:07.415
You forgot to take the plastic wrap off.

16:07.450 --> 16:09.717
The butcher said
just put it in the oven.

16:09.753 --> 16:11.286
- It's foolproof.
- It is.

16:11.321 --> 16:12.487
Proof that you're a fool.

16:12.522 --> 16:14.555
She's not.

16:14.591 --> 16:17.692
She is. We're back to no Easter dinner.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.663
Easter's starting to remind me
a lot of Fourth of July.

16:29.639 --> 16:33.441
You ever notice how Diaz Easter
sounds a lot like disaster?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.238
There goes Easter dinner.

16:42.263 --> 16:44.502
At least car ham's gonna
have a buddy in ham heaven.

16:44.538 --> 16:47.438
New plan. I'm gonna go to
the store and get another one.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.502
Georgie, you start peeling the potatoes.

16:49.527 --> 16:50.837
Okay.

16:50.838 --> 16:52.310
And take them out of the bag first.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.478
Okay, let's see.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.480
What's next?

17:29.516 --> 17:31.382
Ooh, looks like centerpieces.

17:31.418 --> 17:34.252
Okay. I need four people
on centerpieces.

17:34.287 --> 17:39.557
Mustache, mom jeans, beret,
cargo shorts. Hop to.

17:39.592 --> 17:43.461
I make a much better assistant to the
assistant than the actual assistant.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.464
Uh-huh. You wanna grab me
a hot chocolate, sweetie?

17:46.499 --> 17:47.699
Mm-hmm.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.569
It's amazing how much
candy people gave us.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.738
Do you think
trick of Tranksgiving will work?

17:53.773 --> 17:56.274
We did such a good job,

17:56.309 --> 17:59.310
I'll bet the Easter bunny will
bring us on staff next year.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.549
- Our baskets.
- Look!

18:06.386 --> 18:09.320
How dare he steal the candy
we suckered people out of?

18:09.356 --> 18:11.556
Get him!

18:13.493 --> 18:15.526
Did you fix the old register yet?

18:15.562 --> 18:17.428
I think so.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.297
The video's in French. I'm really hoping

18:19.332 --> 18:22.433
<i>ouvrir le tiroir</i> means
"open the drawer,"

18:22.469 --> 18:24.335
and not "explode in my face."

18:27.707 --> 18:29.507
Yes!

18:29.542 --> 18:31.576
I thought you were fixing
the electric saw.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.347
I searched for it, but got side
tracked learning the electric slide.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.350
That can't be a thing people do.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.688
Huh. It is.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.600
I'm not sure that's entirely safe.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.668
Do you want safe or fast?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.606
Yes. Crushed it.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.343
I can see why they recommend
taking the plastic off.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.345
Went through another box of...

19:09.549 --> 19:12.550
Uh-oh. Honey's not the only
thing glazing that ham.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.621
That raccoon was tougher than I thought.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.357
And not a quitter.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.691
He has my respect.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.493
We're still okay,

19:22.529 --> 19:24.495
as long as nobody minds
their candy covered in

19:24.531 --> 19:26.597
teeth marks and raccoon spit.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.338
You gotta be kidding me!
Where's the grass?

19:38.678 --> 19:42.380
Nature, why are you against us?

19:46.419 --> 19:49.487
Baskets came out great.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.457
How are things going in here?

19:52.492 --> 19:56.561
Guys. Reality check. Those are a mess.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.464
- So it's noticeable?
- I thought you had this.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.433
For once, an animal was
more destructive than us.

20:02.469 --> 20:05.570
- Rachel!
- Oops.

20:05.605 --> 20:09.273
You graffitied my ham.
What is wrong with you?

20:09.309 --> 20:10.741
Don't yell at me.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.643
At least all my eggs
are totally on point,

20:12.679 --> 20:14.378
Chef Boy-are-you-dumb.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.481
Oh, really?

20:18.318 --> 20:21.319
Whoops. Chef Boy-are-I-clumsy.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.422
Ooh, egg smashing.
Is this an Easter tradition?

20:24.457 --> 20:25.723
It is now!

20:30.697 --> 20:32.330
No!

20:36.436 --> 20:38.402
I guess I didn't boil all of them.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.372
What is going on?

20:42.442 --> 20:43.741
Not Easter.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.312
Well, it's over.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.315
Diaz Easter time of death: 3:46 p.m.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.417
You'll soon be followed by Halloween,

20:53.453 --> 20:56.354
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.623
We may as well just
throw our calendars out.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.758
Days will be meaningless.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.595
Honey, I'm sorry.

21:04.631 --> 21:08.266
I know you were trying to make
today special for Daphne.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.600
Wait.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.536
Where is Daphne?

21:16.309 --> 21:19.610
This is so easy.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.746
Don't get too cocky.
There's a spin coming up.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.682
One, two three...

21:32.392 --> 21:34.358
Oh, we're nailin' this.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.460
Hey, do you think there's a lot of work

21:36.496 --> 21:38.462
for father-son electric slide duos?

21:38.498 --> 21:40.765
There will be, son.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.601
There will be. And...

21:46.739 --> 21:49.640
Well, that explains why
Dad wasn't picking up his phone.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.410
Tom! Is Daphne with you?

21:52.445 --> 21:54.378
What? No. I thought she was with you.

21:54.414 --> 21:57.615
Everybody chill. Daphne's fine.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.351
Ellie just posted that Daphne was voted

22:00.386 --> 22:02.687
church volunteer of the month.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.523
I wanna say that clears up the mystery,

22:05.558 --> 22:07.425
but I'm not sure it does.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.298
There's my baby.

22:17.303 --> 22:18.636
We're really sorry we left
you at the church.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.638
And for all the other stuff we did today

22:20.673 --> 22:21.739
that you don't know about.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.342
I'm glad to see you,

22:24.377 --> 22:27.311
but all this baby stuff
is making me look weak.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.679
I am in charge of this whole section.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.715
In charge? What?

22:30.750 --> 22:33.451
She helped do all this.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.388
Daphne, I'm so impressed.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.290
I helped her help.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.361
We have people to feed,

22:43.396 --> 22:45.763
and I can use some more volunteers.

22:45.798 --> 22:49.333
Everyone, grab an apron.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.302
You heard the lady. Apron up.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.676
You're welcome for the free babysitting.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.544
The first six could use some work,

23:00.580 --> 23:02.279
but the little one has a chance.

23:02.315 --> 23:04.281
Thanks so much for looking out for her.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.718
Okay, now take your germs
away from the food

23:07.754 --> 23:10.388
before the less fortunate
become more less fortunate.

23:14.527 --> 23:17.294
I'm sorry Diaz Easter
wasn't what I promised.

23:17.330 --> 23:19.463
It wasn't.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.298
But it turns out,

23:21.334 --> 23:24.502
being the last kid
in a big family isn't all bad.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.704
It gave me the confidence to do this.

23:28.541 --> 23:31.542
And you're the first one
in on this new Diaz tradition.

23:31.577 --> 23:32.743
You should be proud.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.379
Thanks. You still owe me candy.
