00:49.482 --> 00:51.814
<i>Scorpion-class pulse warriors.</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:54.550
<i>Kamikaze bombardiers.</i>

00:54.754 --> 00:57.279
<i>Every day,
new Bugs show up on the battlefield.</i>

00:58.691 --> 01:00.249
Watch out! Get down, get down!

01:00.460 --> 01:02.428
<i>So many that some wonder:</i>

01:05.899 --> 01:06.888
GIQ on one.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.533
<i>Don't bet on it, citizen.</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:10.430
<i>Here at Oppenheimer
Proving Grounds...</i>

01:10.637 --> 01:13.970
<i>... federal scientists are cooking up
some nasty top-secret surprises...</i>

01:14.174 --> 01:15.835
<i>... of their own.</i>

01:22.549 --> 01:25.143
<i>But the newest weapon
in the Mobile Infantry's arsenal...</i>

01:25.351 --> 01:27.080
<i>... is the not-so-secret shovel.</i>

01:27.287 --> 01:29.152
<i>Greater Bug firepower
means trenches.</i>

01:29.355 --> 01:31.220
<i>And that means digging
here on Roku San...</i>

01:31.424 --> 01:33.051
<i>... this once peaceful farm planet...</i>

01:33.259 --> 01:36.092
<i>... that has become the new frontline
of the Second Bug War.</i>

01:36.296 --> 01:39.788
<i>There you go, trooper.
And put your back into it.</i>

01:42.302 --> 01:44.463
<i>If you're against the war,
you're against us.</i>

01:45.872 --> 01:47.703
<i>That's what a federal judge
said today...</i>

01:47.907 --> 01:50.671
<i>... when he declared that hanging
is absolutely good enough...</i>

01:50.877 --> 01:53.471
<i>... for anyone who threatens
the morale of the Federation.</i>

01:53.680 --> 01:55.910
- and death. Execute them all.

01:57.750 --> 02:01.811
This is a very simple ruling.
People need to watch what they say.

02:02.021 --> 02:04.751
<i>Admiral Enolo Phid,
division chief, Fleet Intelligence...</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:08.359
<i>... voiced another concern from her
headquarters at Terran Command.</i>

02:08.561 --> 02:12.122
The revival of religious worship here
and in the outer colonies...

02:12.332 --> 02:15.768
...will not be tolerated
if it leads to sedition...

02:15.969 --> 02:19.461
...or in any other way
destabilizes our war effort.

02:22.675 --> 02:25.405
<i>He's dark, he's handsome,
he's psychic.</i>

02:25.612 --> 02:28.274
<i>Courage, duty, honor</i>

02:28.481 --> 02:29.709
<i>Eagle high above</i>

02:29.916 --> 02:33.352
<i>He's General Omar Anoke,
the sky marshal everyone loves.</i>

02:33.553 --> 02:36.522
<i>And gives us strength
To go and win this war</i>

02:36.723 --> 02:38.156
<i>And at last night's war rally...</i>

02:38.358 --> 02:40.758
<i>... he thrilled audiences
all across the Federation...</i>

02:40.960 --> 02:44.396
<i>... with a pounding rendition
of his latest hit, "A Good Day to Die."</i>

02:44.597 --> 02:46.360
<i>We fight for what is right</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:50.136
<i>A noble sacrifice</i>

02:50.336 --> 02:52.804
<i>When duty calls, you pay the price</i>

02:53.006 --> 02:57.136
<i>For the Federation
I will give my life</i>

03:05.218 --> 03:08.483
<i>And hey, citizen, now you can
celebrate Sky Marshal Anoke...</i>

03:08.688 --> 03:11.020
<i>... and support our war effort
at the same time.</i>

03:11.224 --> 03:13.920
<i>Because it's always
a good day to buy.</i>

03:14.127 --> 03:17.119
<i>- I will give my life
- Courage, duty, honor</i>

03:17.330 --> 03:21.130
<i>For the Federation
I will give my life</i>

03:50.496 --> 03:52.555
Incoming!

04:07.213 --> 04:08.544
- Clear out!
- Run!

04:08.748 --> 04:09.737
Move, move, move!

04:30.770 --> 04:31.759
Can you walk, soldier?

04:31.971 --> 04:33.302
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

04:33.506 --> 04:36.669
Give us a hand. Pick up that arm
and find out who it belongs to.

04:36.876 --> 04:38.503
Yes, sir.

04:44.350 --> 04:48.013
Mop up, people.
We got brass up our ass in T-minus-2.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.416
Surprise inspection, sir? Tonight?

04:50.623 --> 04:53.285
The SM can drop in and count
the sheets any time he wants.

04:53.493 --> 04:56.018
The sky marshal's coming here?

04:56.229 --> 05:00.131
Ask him for an autograph, Lieutenant
Manion, and I will have you shot.

05:00.333 --> 05:04.201
No, sir. Of course not, sir.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.769
- Officer on deck.
- Carry on.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.837
Status?

05:14.247 --> 05:18.274
- Archie's testing the fence again, sir.
- Stupid Bugs.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.780
Pesky, not stupid, lieutenant.

05:20.987 --> 05:25.481
Keep it up, Archie.
I like my Bugs fried in the morning.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.794
Boat coming down, colonel.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.021
Look sharp, troopers.

05:45.545 --> 05:49.572
Sir, the sky marshal is the
Federation's top-secret top secret.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.215
So how'd you know
he was coming?

05:51.417 --> 05:53.510
Anoke's chief of staff
used to polish my brass.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.085
You know General Hauzer?

05:55.288 --> 05:58.416
Dix Hauzer was a dope lieutenant
just like you once upon a time.

05:58.624 --> 06:01.457
Made general in two years.
Some dope.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.459
Only took me eight years
to make colonel.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.737
Officer on deck.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.012
- John Rico.
- Good to see you, Dix.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.277
- How's it going?
- Good.

06:24.484 --> 06:27.385
I have to introduce you to someone.
I think I'm in love.

06:27.587 --> 06:28.952
Yeah? Who'd have you?

06:29.756 --> 06:31.781
Here he comes, everybody.
Let's go, come on.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.451
Officer on deck.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.461
Sorry to drop in unannounced,
colonel.

06:42.301 --> 06:45.202
And yet I sense you expect my visit.

06:49.609 --> 06:55.445
Get in tight on this, sergeant.
Johnny Rico, our hero of Planet P.

06:55.648 --> 06:56.706
I just did my part, sir.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.511
Oh, no.
Heroes inspire courage, sacrifice.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.210
- Sacrifice?
- Yes.

07:02.422 --> 07:06.620
By asking us
to be better than what we are.

07:08.528 --> 07:11.463
Tell me about Roku San, colonel.

07:11.664 --> 07:14.258
Will these farmers fight?

07:14.467 --> 07:17.527
They need us,
but they don't like us, sir.

07:17.737 --> 07:20.501
Hearts are more fickle than minds.

07:24.544 --> 07:25.670
Johnny Rico.

07:27.346 --> 07:28.438
Lola Beck?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.409
What are you doing here?

07:31.617 --> 07:32.675
I fly the SM.

07:33.219 --> 07:35.153
He gets the best.

07:35.354 --> 07:38.152
Well, you know me, Johnny.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.484
Yes, I know you.

07:43.529 --> 07:46.259
Captain Beck is the person
I was talking about earlier.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.460
You?

07:49.101 --> 07:50.625
And Lola?

07:55.908 --> 07:56.932
What's the joke?

07:58.444 --> 08:00.776
Captain Beck,
you should have informed me...

08:00.980 --> 08:03.107
...of your relationship
with Colonel Rico.

08:04.350 --> 08:08.013
You know what I do out of uniform
is off the clock, general.

08:08.521 --> 08:11.115
You three obviously
have much to discuss.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.951
Buy them both
a drink on me, colonel.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.353
Yes, sir.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.688
- Lieutenant Manion, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

08:17.897 --> 08:20.730
- Care to give me the post tour?
- Me?

08:23.035 --> 08:25.663
I have all your songs, sir.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.503
- Carry on, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.335
Follow me, sir.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.534
Come on, kids. We got orders.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.748
You boys are the biggest girls
I've ever known.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.524
What do you think of them?

08:51.731 --> 08:55.098
Bugs? I hate them, sir.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.394
Well, no one likes
what they can't understand.

08:59.005 --> 09:01.599
But just look at the imagination.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.169
The sheer virtuosity
of their creation.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.245
I hate to bother you, sir, but
could you please sign my helmet?

09:08.447 --> 09:10.415
Of course, trooper.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.787
- Thank you, sir.
- Anytime, son.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.216
All I know is...

09:17.423 --> 09:20.950
...there sure are a lot more of them
at the wire today, sir.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.354
A lot more.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.697
Well, maybe they heard
I was going to sing.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.138
- Officer on deck.
- Look sharp.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.272
At ease.

09:49.989 --> 09:50.978
Gentlemen.

09:55.027 --> 09:58.292
You got me confused
with someone who isn't a farmer.

09:58.731 --> 10:01.928
- How do I get me a hat like that?
- Join up, do your part.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.939
Farmers.

10:09.141 --> 10:12.076
- I'd like to ask you something.
- Sorry, chief.

10:13.145 --> 10:15.079
Already married.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.814
Buy them a drink on me, will you?
And bring us a bottle.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.350
Hose your cage, Harlan.

10:23.856 --> 10:27.519
These are the kind of people
who will lose this war for us.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.594
Why is it no one in the outer colonies
wants to fight?

10:31.163 --> 10:33.290
Roku San used to be a nice place.

10:33.499 --> 10:36.195
Now it's war, and they blame us.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.833
Archie's cooking tonight.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.529
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.572
- What are they thinking?
- Archie don't think.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.838
It's a good day to fry.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.249
- Ten-hut.
- At ease, troopers.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.150
Fascinating.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.258
They seem so excited tonight.

11:00.459 --> 11:03.223
You ought to hear them, sir.
They're howling out there.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.488
Well, put them on the line, soldier.

11:13.939 --> 11:16.305
What does it mean, sir?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.205
It means we're being tested,
lieutenant.

11:19.645 --> 11:23.081
Our loyalty, our intelligence...

11:23.282 --> 11:25.273
...our imagination.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.618
Excuse me, sir.
My brother really loves you.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.518
- Of course. What's his name?
- Kevin.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.886
- I'm sure he'll make a fine recruit.
- Thank you.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.994
- May I, sir?
- Of course you can, trooper.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.825
<i>Ask him for an autograph, Lieutenant
Manion, and I will have you shot.</i>

11:43.836 --> 11:44.860
Hey, where'd he go?

11:56.549 --> 11:57.709
To us.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.314
To us.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.756
To John, hero of Planet P.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.786
Lola, two ships
shot out from under you.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.460
I fly a goddamn desk.

12:13.933 --> 12:17.027
The battles I fight are with numbers.
That's what I do.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.364
That's what I know.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.063
And that's why I know...

12:22.274 --> 12:26.142
...that if everyone in here
doesn't step up, we're sunk.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.947
- To the Federation.
- The Federation.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.748
"To the Federation."

12:43.529 --> 12:45.394
So, Dix.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.122
Rico and I met...

12:47.333 --> 12:50.825
...when Johnny was a big war hero
and I was still a six.

12:51.036 --> 12:53.766
Bond tour. Ten planets, eight days.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.669
Do you remember Turtle Bay?

13:02.081 --> 13:03.514
So, Dix, how do you know Johnny?

13:03.716 --> 13:07.311
Well, he used to be my boss
at TCOM.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.788
Standard rotation.
Worst year of my life.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.480
Dix saved my ass every day.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.318
Hey, it's hanging time.

13:22.701 --> 13:26.364
<i>Appeals are exhausted.
Their families have said goodbye.</i>

13:26.572 --> 13:31.009
<i>All that remains is payment
for their crimes against you, citizen.</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:37.112
<i>The senior executive executioner
is taking his time.</i>

13:38.651 --> 13:40.175
<i>Sending a message, perhaps.</i>

13:40.686 --> 13:43.120
<i>One for all of us to contemplate
this evening.</i>

13:43.322 --> 13:47.486
<i>That our ideas,
no matter how pleasing...</i>

13:47.693 --> 13:49.285
<i>... are dangerous.</i>

13:49.495 --> 13:52.521
<i>That there are actions
and consequences.</i>

13:52.731 --> 13:54.995
<i>That no one really counts
very much...</i>

13:55.201 --> 13:58.193
<i>... unless we are part
of something bigger.</i>

14:24.363 --> 14:27.264
<i>There it is, justice.</i>

14:28.400 --> 14:31.164
You'll pay.
As God is my witness, you'll pay.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.201
- Back off.
- Hold on, hold on, wait, wait.

14:33.405 --> 14:34.963
Hey, fuck off, feddy.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.836
You guys fail to understand
a very clear lesson here.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.408
You got something to learn me?

14:39.612 --> 14:42.638
- Come on, Dix, let's get out of here.
- Colonel Rico, if you please.

14:42.848 --> 14:44.042
Yes, sir.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.378
MPs, now. I want them arrested.
Everyone. That's an order.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.551
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.055
You heard the general.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.886
My friends,
you're not bigger than the Federation.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.528
Watch what you say
and do what you're told.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.358
- Or you'll have us hung, is that it?
- It's up to you.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.529
Come on, Dix.
Let's get Lola out of here.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.971
I don't work for you anymore, John.
Stand down.

15:12.845 --> 15:17.441
Did you hear that, everybody?
Stand down. That's an order.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.414
From now on, I take my own lumps.

15:23.789 --> 15:24.915
I got this.

15:30.963 --> 15:33.591
Now you're in violation of Article 5.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.498
Article 8.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.232
- Had enough?
- Stand down, Rico.

15:44.743 --> 15:46.108
Stand down.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.285
That's Article 11.

15:55.154 --> 15:56.348
That's 11.

15:56.555 --> 15:59.251
Which makes you subject to...

16:04.330 --> 16:06.457
- Special Order 86.
- Look out!

16:12.004 --> 16:14.564
Colonel Rico, you're out of order.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.331
Begging the general's pardon, sir.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.711
I was trying to keep an old friend
from making an ass of himself.

16:19.912 --> 16:23.109
Friendship means nothing
next to duty, colonel.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.646
And you have forgotten yours.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.815
I thought we were here
to kill Bugs, sir.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.480
Not farmers.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.954
Arrest the farmers. Sedition.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.792
- And Colonel Rico too.
- All right, on your feet, asshole.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.195
- Failure to obey a superior officer.
- Hey, Dix, stop it.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.028
Johnny's right.

16:44.236 --> 16:45.225
Move it!

16:45.437 --> 16:47.132
Captain Beck.

16:48.574 --> 16:49.563
Return to your boat.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.305
Sergeant, you have your orders.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.070
Colonel, please come with me.

16:59.585 --> 17:02.213
<i>Electrical system malfunction.</i>

17:03.655 --> 17:04.679
Oh, no.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.031
Here they come,
they're on the wall.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.675
<i>- Rico.
- It's all down. Everything.</i>

17:27.880 --> 17:29.541
<i>The fence is down, sir.</i>

17:29.748 --> 17:32.740
- The fence?
- How could that have happened?

17:33.786 --> 17:35.447
<i>Fuck, here they come.</i>

17:37.890 --> 17:39.517
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

17:40.259 --> 17:42.386
<i>We need reinforcements.</i>

17:42.895 --> 17:45.193
<i>We need reinforcements now, sir!</i>

17:45.998 --> 17:49.490
- I'm on my way.
- Hold on. You are under arrest.

17:49.701 --> 17:52.135
- Is that your final word?
- No, that's an order.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.631
I'll see you at my court-martial.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.244
- Nice seeing you, Lola.
- Yeah.

18:02.948 --> 18:05.883
Make a hole, coming through.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.483
Heads up, colonel.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.818
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.497
Come on, you apes.
You wanna live forever?

18:21.700 --> 18:23.725
Move it. Come on.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.926
Keep it moving.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.504
Fall back.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.830
Defensive positions. Incoming.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.161
Let's go.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.871
Go. Go.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.843
Out of ammo, man. Out of ammo.

20:23.288 --> 20:24.619
No!

20:32.664 --> 20:36.532
- Bugs!
- Two lines! Front and back!

20:44.376 --> 20:45.365
Fire!

20:54.953 --> 20:56.818
Grenades!

20:57.022 --> 20:58.284
Fire!

21:00.759 --> 21:02.158
Forward!

21:27.653 --> 21:28.642
Colonel Rico, sir.

21:30.622 --> 21:34.080
- Situation, lieutenant.
- Totally ominously fucked up, sir.

21:34.559 --> 21:38.017
And I lost the sky marshal too, sir.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.225
Good. We'll all hang together.

21:42.434 --> 21:46.996
You know what to do.
Get in there and kill them all!

21:55.714 --> 21:57.341
- Where's forward command?
- It's Bugs.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.449
It's Bugs.
Bugs everywhere you go, sir.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.719
Sir, what are you doing here?

22:09.127 --> 22:12.119
Are you wounded? We have
to get you to the lander right now.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.060
I'm fine.

22:15.934 --> 22:19.665
Marines, gather around. We must get
the sky marshal to safety right now.

22:19.871 --> 22:23.238
Yes, sir. Formation.
This way, general.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.673
Archie.

22:34.152 --> 22:35.847
Clear.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.327
Keep moving.

22:57.776 --> 23:00.176
Archie. Get that paddock open.

23:01.913 --> 23:04.108
This is General Hauzer.
Open this door.

23:05.784 --> 23:06.773
Open the door.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.016
Sir.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.696
Get this door closed!

23:20.699 --> 23:23.224
Dr. Wiggs, over here.
Dr. Wiggs, we need you.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.834
Get him inside.

23:26.037 --> 23:29.473
- Corpsman, see to Sergeant Rye.
- Yes, sir.

23:32.177 --> 23:34.702
Fucking Bugs. I hate them!

23:34.913 --> 23:37.882
Dr. Wiggs. Front and center.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.881
- What's wrong with him?
- Careful.

23:44.856 --> 23:47.620
He's in shock. Are you all right, sir?

23:52.130 --> 23:54.030
Are you all right, sir?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.399
Sir?

23:58.336 --> 24:00.736
- I will be.
- Oh, good.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.135
Here we go. Careful.

24:04.342 --> 24:06.276
Captain Beck, when do we leave?

24:06.478 --> 24:09.072
How about T-minus-now, sir?

24:09.581 --> 24:13.813
Sir, requesting permission
to remain on Roku San, sir.

24:14.019 --> 24:17.250
- Trying to be a hero, Dix?
- Somebody's gotta stay and fight.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.980
Sir.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.156
Colonel Rico is in command.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.555
I was forced to relieve Colonel Rico.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.993
He's under arrest
for acts of insubordination.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.430
Serious charges.
I'm sorry for your friend.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.967
Perhaps your destiny
does lay here after all, Dix.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.530
Go find it.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.099
And good luck, soldier.

24:42.013 --> 24:43.446
Wait.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.976
Just think about this for a second.

24:46.184 --> 24:49.711
Because you're making a decision
for the both of us right now.

24:52.023 --> 24:53.513
I know.

24:55.794 --> 24:58.194
Dix, I love you.

24:59.397 --> 25:00.887
I love you.

25:07.439 --> 25:09.236
Blast off, Fleet.

25:23.121 --> 25:24.918
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

25:25.123 --> 25:26.556
This is General Hauzer.

25:26.758 --> 25:28.726
<i>I am assuming command
effective immediately.</i>

25:28.927 --> 25:29.916
Go to the bunker!

25:30.128 --> 25:34.030
<i>Repeat, I'm assuming command.
All unit commanders report.</i>

25:34.232 --> 25:36.723
<i>I want location and status. Now.</i>

25:36.935 --> 25:38.232
We lost G Trench, sir.

25:39.938 --> 25:42.771
Put that in a memo to
General Hauzer, will you, lieutenant?

25:42.974 --> 25:44.168
Yes, sir.

25:45.143 --> 25:48.670
This is Hauzer to all units.
I say again, I'm assuming command.

25:59.791 --> 26:02.123
They're pulling back, sir.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.029
- Get down!
- Hit the deck!

26:15.707 --> 26:16.935
Clear the deck.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.667
Skinner, Hightower, cover that hole.

26:19.878 --> 26:21.869
Prepare for attack!

26:24.616 --> 26:26.880
Bombardier!

26:48.640 --> 26:50.107
Scorp! It's a scorp!

26:50.308 --> 26:52.003
Scorpion.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.610
Scorpion! Oh, fuck! Scorpion!

27:01.853 --> 27:02.911
Fire, fire, fire!

27:20.639 --> 27:21.663
Grenades!

27:50.935 --> 27:53.426
Take us home, Captain Beck.

27:54.906 --> 27:56.498
Warp in five, number one.

27:56.708 --> 27:59.734
<i>Yes, ma'am.
What about General Hauzer, ma'am?</i>

27:59.944 --> 28:02.913
He wants combat.
Take us out on my mark.

28:03.114 --> 28:06.675
Five, four, three, two, one.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.586
The guy says, "Man,
then we can all get some sleep."

28:18.797 --> 28:21.197
Fucking Archie.
Can't believe I got bitten.

28:21.399 --> 28:23.162
Yeah, he got you.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.199
Officer on deck.

28:26.337 --> 28:28.202
At ease.

28:30.508 --> 28:31.873
Nice work out there, sergeant.

28:32.577 --> 28:35.045
Thank you, ma'am. SM all okay?

28:36.915 --> 28:38.644
Thanks to you boys.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.750
What do we say, marines?

28:42.020 --> 28:45.285
- Yeah.
- Carry on.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.054
Oh, boy.

28:51.863 --> 28:54.696
Chief Brittles, are we shipshape?

28:54.899 --> 28:57.527
You'd be the first to know, captain.

28:57.969 --> 29:00.028
Just saying hi, Bull.

29:08.713 --> 29:09.702
Excuse me, ma'am.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.747
If that's the SM's dinner,
after you, Holly.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.578
Thank you, ma'am.

29:14.786 --> 29:16.083
What's cooking, Jingo?

29:16.287 --> 29:18.847
You know,
the same old shit on a shingle.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.968
- Drink, captain?
- On duty, doc.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.696
Me too.

29:39.577 --> 29:42.671
Captain Beck.
Give a listen, will you?

29:43.648 --> 29:47.584
Today we have suffered grave defeat
at Roku San.

29:48.419 --> 29:53.652
But I am confident that there exists
balance in the cosmos and...

29:53.858 --> 29:55.120
Excuse me, sir.

29:58.863 --> 30:03.527
I am certain that there exists balance
in the cosmos.

30:03.735 --> 30:07.933
And where there is defeat,
we will make victory.

30:09.674 --> 30:10.868
What do you think?

30:11.075 --> 30:13.509
I have to address
the council tomorrow.

30:13.711 --> 30:16.202
Well, sir, everybody loves victory.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.942
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be getting back to the cockpit.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.953
Look, look, can't they manage
without you just for once?

30:26.157 --> 30:28.182
Let's stay and talk.

30:29.627 --> 30:31.993
Certainly, sir, I'd be happy to.

30:37.402 --> 30:38.733
Hold on.

30:40.638 --> 30:42.071
We're falling out of warp.

30:52.550 --> 30:53.983
Sir, for your own protection...

30:54.185 --> 30:56.745
...l'm gonna need to get you
to the marine lander.

30:57.822 --> 30:59.653
Holly, stay with us.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.925
- What just hit us?
- I think we just hit each other.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.626
Come on, Holly, let's move.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.732
- Marines, report to the rescue deck.
- I read you, Captain Beck.

31:13.938 --> 31:15.496
And we are on our way.

31:18.109 --> 31:19.508
Let's go.

31:25.283 --> 31:26.750
Come on.

31:29.153 --> 31:31.087
Marines. Right here, brothers.

31:31.589 --> 31:32.578
Let's go.

31:42.166 --> 31:43.599
Was that a reactor, chief?

31:43.801 --> 31:46.395
Secondary. Number one
will turn us into daylight.

31:46.971 --> 31:49.599
I'm okay. I'm okay.

31:49.807 --> 31:52.002
- Abandon ship, chief.
- Yes, ma'am.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.905
Sergeant Rye,
the SM goes with you.

31:54.112 --> 31:56.239
Yes, ma'am. Come with us now, sir.

31:56.447 --> 31:58.915
Captain Beck, I would prefer
that you stay at my side.

31:59.117 --> 32:01.745
Yes, sir. Crew chief,
get everyone else to the rescue pod.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.420
You got it.

32:04.889 --> 32:07.483
- We got a little problem in the galley.
- Jingo, jeez.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.455
Dumb ass.

32:11.796 --> 32:12.888
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.122
Go get the SM, Chick.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.391
Sir, this way.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.772
No! Damn it!

32:29.714 --> 32:33.309
- Marines, get to your lander.
- I will see you on the ground.

32:33.518 --> 32:36.180
Okay, people, let's move.
To the rescue pod, now.

32:36.387 --> 32:39.015
- Are we crashing?
- No, we're getting into the rescue pod.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.885
<i>The Roku San line,
key to the Federation's defense...</i>

33:13.091 --> 33:15.252
<i>... knows defeat in one night.</i>

33:15.460 --> 33:19.157
<i>How many dead? No man can say.</i>

33:19.364 --> 33:20.854
<i>Experts agree on one thing only:</i>

33:21.065 --> 33:23.556
<i>Blame falls squarely
on Colonel John Rico.</i>

33:24.969 --> 33:27.164
<i>Once heralded
as the hero of Planet P.</i>

33:27.372 --> 33:29.306
<i>Now disgraced
and awaiting court-martial...</i>

33:29.507 --> 33:33.409
<i>... from his cell at the Alamo Bay
Federal Detention Facility.</i>

33:34.679 --> 33:37.546
<i>Another day, another peace rally
in the outer colonies.</i>

33:37.749 --> 33:40.013
<i>The Federation
has taken advantage.</i>

33:40.218 --> 33:43.483
<i>But this time it's different,
because of Elmo Goniff.</i>

33:43.688 --> 33:44.814
Hey, I'm a citizen.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.923
<i>Decorated veteran turned pacifist...</i>

33:47.125 --> 33:49.787
<i>... and now the leader
of a growing coalition of citizens...</i>

33:49.994 --> 33:52.224
<i>... who question the Federation's
administration...</i>

33:52.430 --> 33:53.692
<i>... of the Arachnid conflict.</i>

33:53.898 --> 33:57.857
- and counting. Why?
I found my answers in faith.

33:58.069 --> 34:00.333
<i>And I have faith in God, not people.</i>

34:00.538 --> 34:04.372
<i>Peace at any price is a human right.</i>

34:04.575 --> 34:06.406
<i>And there are other costs too.</i>

34:06.611 --> 34:09.273
<i>Defeat at Roku San
has fueled the anti-war movement...</i>

34:09.480 --> 34:12.449
<i>... resulting in the deaths
of 144 outer-colony students...</i>

34:12.650 --> 34:14.413
<i>... and religious protesters.</i>

34:18.589 --> 34:21.683
<i>We break net now to take you live
to Terran Command...</i>

34:21.893 --> 34:24.885
<i>... where Sky Marshal Omar Anoke
will address the Federation...</i>

34:25.096 --> 34:26.620
<i>... on the Roku San crisis.</i>

34:28.800 --> 34:32.964
<i>My fellow citizens, I come
to you today with a heavy heart.</i>

34:33.804 --> 34:35.864
<i>Within the past 12 hours...</i>

34:36.074 --> 34:40.204
<i>... we have suffered
ignominious defeat at Roku San.</i>

34:40.411 --> 34:43.005
<i>Incompetence at the highest levels
of command...</i>

34:43.214 --> 34:46.877
...and betrayal...

34:47.085 --> 34:51.248
...by those who would protest,
question...

34:51.456 --> 34:54.755
...and commit acts
of civil disobedience.

34:55.293 --> 34:59.992
I assure you that those responsible
for the catastrophe at Roku San...

35:00.198 --> 35:04.532
...and all crimes against
the Federation, large and small...

35:04.735 --> 35:07.329
...will be punished.

35:09.373 --> 35:13.810
Ours is a war of human destiny...

35:14.278 --> 35:18.578
...that will end only in total victory.

35:24.355 --> 35:26.220
And we're out.

35:26.691 --> 35:30.127
Okay, let's wrap it up. Good.

35:32.530 --> 35:33.519
So?

35:37.301 --> 35:40.361
What's the matter, general?
You don't look very happy with me.

35:40.571 --> 35:42.869
We all understand
the need to maintain stability...

35:43.074 --> 35:44.666
...until we locate the sky marshal.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.002
I'm surprised to see you.

35:46.210 --> 35:49.373
I thought you'd take some time
to recover from your ordeal.

35:49.580 --> 35:53.277
The sky marshal would want me
in the office, admiral.

35:53.484 --> 35:54.508
Naturally.

36:46.337 --> 36:48.134
Excuse me, sir.

36:49.073 --> 36:50.563
Sorry, sir.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.477
- Lieutenant?
- Lamb.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.581
I know no one's supposed
to talk about it...

36:59.784 --> 37:01.752
...but I'm sorry
about the sky marshal, sir.

37:01.953 --> 37:05.889
That's classified, lieutenant.
Phid will have your head in a noose.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.952
But thanks.

37:16.767 --> 37:17.756
Something else?

37:17.969 --> 37:21.097
A distress call
came out of the AQZ yesterday.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.468
And how are you aware of this
and I'm not?

37:27.678 --> 37:30.272
The transmission came through
on my watch, sir.

37:32.950 --> 37:36.113
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.
Come in, Fleet.</i>

37:36.320 --> 37:38.686
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform,
this is Fleet Rescue, over.</i>

37:38.889 --> 37:42.222
<i>Requesting priority pickup
for sky marshal plus five.</i>

37:46.163 --> 37:48.028
What happened
when you kicked it upstairs?

37:48.232 --> 37:52.635
We were instructed to ignore it, sir,
and all future transmissions.

37:52.837 --> 37:55.601
And I'm supposed to
keep my mouth shut.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.499
That why you're here, lieutenant?

37:58.943 --> 38:02.606
They're out there all alone
and no one's doing anything about it.

38:03.547 --> 38:04.639
Sir.

38:06.984 --> 38:09.214
You were never here, lieutenant.

38:09.754 --> 38:12.689
No, sir. Never.

38:28.673 --> 38:32.541
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.
Come in, Fleet.</i>

38:35.946 --> 38:38.642
Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.181
Fleet Rescue, come in.

38:42.586 --> 38:44.645
They're gonna come and get us,
right, captain?

38:44.855 --> 38:46.720
I mean, like,
how long till they get here?

38:46.924 --> 38:48.016
Here you go, doc.

38:48.225 --> 38:52.059
I say again,
Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.

38:52.263 --> 38:54.026
Come in, Fleet.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.727
Is anyone out there?

39:01.739 --> 39:04.731
I don't think we're getting through.
Jingo, get out of there.

39:04.942 --> 39:08.275
Why? I like it in here. Okay.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.408
The solar cells need recharging.

39:14.585 --> 39:17.053
Don't have time
for a day at the beach.

39:27.932 --> 39:30.059
Bugs!

39:31.602 --> 39:32.728
One or 1000?

39:32.937 --> 39:34.871
Who's to say
there's not an army out there?

39:35.072 --> 39:37.302
- Oh, God.
- I didn't see anything.

39:37.508 --> 39:38.497
Probably a scout.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.734
We need to get off this beach
pronto, people.

39:40.945 --> 39:41.934
Leave the rescue pod?

39:42.146 --> 39:44.774
You want your back to the water
when these Bugs show up?

39:44.982 --> 39:46.415
Be my guest, doc.

39:47.585 --> 39:50.748
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.718
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done...

39:52.923 --> 39:53.912
Give it a break.

39:56.861 --> 39:58.351
Easy now, captain.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.531
You ain't sure,
and you're scaring us all to death.

40:02.299 --> 40:04.199
On Earth as it is in heaven.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.427
Give us this day our daily bread
and del...

40:07.571 --> 40:10.369
You are really getting on my nerves.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.039
You've got no cause to do that.

40:16.781 --> 40:19.716
Get your hand off me, crew chief.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.979
You're hurting him.

40:30.661 --> 40:32.754
Everyone's got a right
to think what they want.

40:32.963 --> 40:35.591
Sure, as long as they keep it
to themselves.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.769
Saddle up. We're moving out.

40:39.203 --> 40:42.172
Wait a second. When Fleet Rescue
comes looking for us...

40:42.373 --> 40:44.773
...this is the first place
they're gonna come, right?

40:44.975 --> 40:46.806
I expect they would, Bull.

40:47.011 --> 40:48.444
Then we should stay right here.

40:48.646 --> 40:51.638
And if the Bugs do attack,
we just fall right back to the pod.

40:52.249 --> 40:53.238
Smart thinking, Bull.

40:55.219 --> 40:57.312
You ever been in a swarm,
big man?

40:57.521 --> 40:59.921
Swarm? Oh, my God, no.

41:00.424 --> 41:02.449
They'll tear this pod apart
like a paper bag.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.690
Oh, God, save us.

41:04.895 --> 41:08.262
Now, gear up, we're moving out.
And that's an order.

41:10.100 --> 41:13.001
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

41:13.204 --> 41:16.696
- Can the God talk.
- You're wrong, Captain Beck.

41:16.907 --> 41:20.308
God is everywhere, surrounding us.

41:20.511 --> 41:21.500
Excuse me, sir?

41:21.712 --> 41:24.510
All of us search for God
in our own way...

41:24.715 --> 41:26.012
...whether we know it or not.

41:28.118 --> 41:30.450
Do you really believe that, sir?

41:30.654 --> 41:32.713
Yes, Holly, I do.

41:32.923 --> 41:37.383
I had no idea
that you were one of us.

41:38.128 --> 41:40.596
All right. Well, all of you guys
can go look for God.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.663
I'm heading
for the Fleet marine lander.

41:43.267 --> 41:45.758
They've got weapons,
maybe even a com that works.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.835
And it's only
about a hundred klicks away.

41:48.038 --> 41:50.131
Only a hundred klicks away.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.673
We ain't got rations for that.

41:52.877 --> 41:56.677
You're fat. You won't need any.
Let's move, people.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.795
<i>Colonel John Rico,
for incompetence of command...</i>

42:21.939 --> 42:24.601
<i>... assault on a superior officer,
and willful negligence...</i>

42:24.808 --> 42:28.574
<i>... resulting in the deaths of several
soldiers under your command...</i>

42:28.779 --> 42:32.374
<i>... you are sentenced to hang
by the neck until you are dead.</i>

42:37.588 --> 42:40.489
Do you have anything to say
before the sentence is carried out?

42:40.691 --> 42:42.249
Get on with it, will you?

42:46.664 --> 42:48.655
I'll see you in hell.

43:20.564 --> 43:22.759
What the hell is this?

43:26.370 --> 43:27.598
Your lucky day.

43:30.274 --> 43:32.333
Intelligence. Classified.

43:32.543 --> 43:35.603
You talk, and next time
it's your neck in the noose.

43:37.715 --> 43:38.773
Let's go, hero.

43:42.152 --> 43:44.746
You gonna hang me yourself, Dix?

43:44.955 --> 43:48.015
Maybe I got some better things
for you to do.

43:48.225 --> 43:50.625
You come here a lot,
don't you, Dix?

43:50.828 --> 43:53.319
Didn't know you were interested
in political prisoners.

43:53.530 --> 43:55.725
Not me.
I come with the sky marshal.

43:55.933 --> 43:58.766
- Interrogations.
- Anoke likes the personal touch, eh?

43:58.969 --> 44:01.802
Not like you think.
Not human prisoners.

44:02.006 --> 44:04.941
That first Brain, the one
you captured on P, we keep it here.

44:05.409 --> 44:08.776
- It's still alive?
- Alive and a lot bigger.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.106
No one really knows
how long they live.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.374
What's it good for?

44:13.584 --> 44:16.348
Anoke was fascinated by that thing.

44:17.021 --> 44:19.649
Why's my neck suddenly worth more
than a piece of rope?

44:19.857 --> 44:22.655
It's about the future
of the Federation, Johnny.

44:22.860 --> 44:25.624
- And Lola.
- What's that got to do with me?

44:25.829 --> 44:29.196
- You're the only one I can trust.
- Why's that, buddy?

44:29.400 --> 44:31.368
Because everyone thinks
you're dead.

45:18.949 --> 45:20.439
- Captain?
- I see them, Jingo.

45:21.418 --> 45:23.113
I count 16.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.582
Bugs? Where?

45:29.226 --> 45:31.285
- Oh, no.
- Why did they stop?

45:32.730 --> 45:33.719
Let's move.

45:38.902 --> 45:39.926
- Bull.
- What?

45:40.137 --> 45:42.833
- You with me.
- You got it.

45:48.011 --> 45:49.273
They're herding us.

45:49.913 --> 45:52.814
Why? They could have us easy.

45:53.016 --> 45:56.315
Perhaps we find ourselves
under the grace of a higher power.

45:57.121 --> 45:58.383
You really think so, sir?

45:58.956 --> 46:01.356
I know it in my heart, Holly.

46:17.174 --> 46:20.735
Do you really think we're protected
by some higher power?

46:20.944 --> 46:22.673
Singing can't hurt.

46:23.213 --> 46:27.809
Lifts the spirit and helps
pass the time, don't you think?

46:35.726 --> 46:38.354
I think we're not dead
and we should be.

46:38.996 --> 46:40.486
Yeah.

47:12.095 --> 47:13.084
<i>It's big. It's deadly.</i>

47:14.498 --> 47:17.558
<i>And everyone's got an opinion
about the new Q-bomb.</i>

47:17.768 --> 47:20.862
<i>Politicians and citizens alike
worry about the morality of a bomb...</i>

47:21.071 --> 47:24.199
<i>... rumored to be so powerful
it can crack a planet.</i>

47:24.408 --> 47:26.933
<i>Creation of a weapon
that can destroy the very planet...</i>

47:27.144 --> 47:31.308
<i>... on which I now stand is nothing
if not a dangerous precedent...</i>

47:31.515 --> 47:33.540
<i>... for the entire human race.</i>

47:33.750 --> 47:35.012
<i>What people fail to grasp...</i>

47:35.219 --> 47:37.449
<i>... is how many planets
there are in the universe.</i>

47:37.654 --> 47:40.714
<i>And that the universe itself
often destroys other planets.</i>

47:40.924 --> 47:44.325
<i>The Federation can't decide which
planet lives and which planet dies.</i>

47:44.528 --> 47:49.397
<i>The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.</i>

47:50.100 --> 47:53.558
<i>You think those dirty Bugs wouldn't
use a Q-bomb if they had one?</i>

47:53.770 --> 47:56.136
<i>But aren't we supposed to be
better than the Bugs?</i>

47:56.340 --> 47:59.741
<i>You said it, Mom.
That's controversy with a Q.</i>

48:06.550 --> 48:09.246
Yesterday I dropped troopers
into a combat zone.

48:09.453 --> 48:11.478
Today I'm flying
to the outer colonies.

48:11.688 --> 48:12.780
I'm Fleet.

48:12.990 --> 48:15.515
- I'm Fleet too.
- We're Fleet too.

48:19.062 --> 48:20.154
Me? Really?

48:20.364 --> 48:22.855
<i>If you have strong math skills,
high reflex index...</i>

48:23.066 --> 48:25.557
<i>... and an HED of 8. 1 or better,
we need you now.</i>

48:25.769 --> 48:26.895
<i>Sixteen? No problem.</i>

48:27.104 --> 48:29.402
<i>Start training today
for your future, citizen.</i>

48:29.606 --> 48:32.166
People say boys don't give good HED.
But I do.

48:32.376 --> 48:35.004
<i>When you go Fleet,
there's no telling where you'll end up.</i>

48:35.212 --> 48:36.509
You know, when I was young...

48:36.713 --> 48:40.240
...I dreamed
that one day I'd fly a starship...

48:40.450 --> 48:42.611
...or even visit Sanctuary.

48:42.819 --> 48:45.253
Fleet has taken me to the top.

48:45.455 --> 48:48.686
How high you fly is up to you
when you go Fleet.

48:48.892 --> 48:52.259
So why not do your part
and sign up today?

48:52.462 --> 48:54.396
See you in the cockpit.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.498
<i>Would you like to know more?</i>

49:11.248 --> 49:12.943
Well, John.

49:13.884 --> 49:16.352
Your first time at Sanctuary.

49:21.792 --> 49:24.693
- So this is the big wow.
- This is it.

49:26.797 --> 49:29.527
If the Bugs find this place,
they'll knock out the Fleet.

49:29.733 --> 49:33.999
No Fleet, you lose the outer colonies.
Mobile Infantry couldn't hold them.

49:34.204 --> 49:36.695
There goes the neighborhood.

49:36.907 --> 49:38.807
- Next stop, Earth.
- Yeah.

49:39.509 --> 49:42.103
Guess that makes Sanctuary
the biggest secret of the war.

49:42.312 --> 49:44.576
Not even the sky marshal
knows where it is.

49:45.749 --> 49:49.947
Only a handful of active-duty pilots
are entrusted with that information.

49:50.153 --> 49:51.677
Don't tell me.

49:52.289 --> 49:53.313
Lola's one of them.

49:55.892 --> 49:59.328
Yup, and if we don't find her,
we're sunk.

50:08.972 --> 50:11.202
I'm sending you
to the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...

50:11.408 --> 50:13.171
...as soon as you saddle up.

50:13.543 --> 50:15.306
What do we know about this planet?

50:15.512 --> 50:16.843
OM-1? Nothing.

50:17.047 --> 50:18.742
We don't even have
its exact position.

50:18.949 --> 50:21.179
What about the rescue call?
Wasn't there a beacon?

50:21.385 --> 50:23.717
Enolo Phid
doesn't want Anoke rescued.

50:23.920 --> 50:27.856
- I don't get it.
- Phid wants to be Anoke.

50:28.058 --> 50:30.618
I'm glad all I do is fight Bugs.

50:30.827 --> 50:32.920
So I'm gonna get the coordinates
and you go in.

50:33.130 --> 50:34.461
Roger that.

50:34.664 --> 50:36.757
But what makes you so sure
they're still alive?

50:36.967 --> 50:39.401
Well, Lola's hard to kill.

50:41.138 --> 50:42.730
If this mission is off the books...

50:42.939 --> 50:45.533
...how are you gonna get me
a regiment to invade the AQZ?

50:45.742 --> 50:49.143
A regiment? Not even close.

50:49.713 --> 50:51.704
- So how many troopers do I get?
- Seven.

50:51.915 --> 50:54.713
- What?
- That's including you.

50:56.453 --> 51:00.514
You're sending me into
the Bug house with a rifle squad?

51:01.658 --> 51:04.320
Why didn't you just
let them hang me, Dix?

51:04.995 --> 51:06.929
Maybe I should have.

51:09.066 --> 51:12.058
Don't worry,
I'm assembling your team now.

51:13.036 --> 51:17.029
It's my funeral. My pick of the team.

51:19.276 --> 51:20.470
Any way you want it.

51:31.054 --> 51:34.285
They aren't much to look at,
are they?

51:34.825 --> 51:38.261
Well, we didn't build them
to do pretty things.

51:49.973 --> 51:51.440
Hey, doc.

51:52.943 --> 51:56.606
- When did he get the religion?
- I wouldn't call it religion per se.

51:56.813 --> 51:59.873
- He's spiritual.
- That's different.

52:00.083 --> 52:03.211
Yeah, two months ago, I received
a call in the middle of the night.

52:03.420 --> 52:05.411
I hadn't seen him for a week.

52:05.622 --> 52:09.114
He told me he'd been in the desert
and that he'd been tested.

52:09.326 --> 52:11.351
He wasn't himself.

52:11.962 --> 52:12.951
Go on.

52:13.163 --> 52:15.563
Well, every man, even great men...

52:15.765 --> 52:19.360
...experience moments of doubt
when they're tired and afraid.

52:19.569 --> 52:21.036
Afraid of what?

52:21.238 --> 52:24.207
He told me that this was a war
that would never end.

52:24.667 --> 52:26.794
That if we stay this course...

52:27.003 --> 52:30.268
...the Bugs will and must
destroy the human race.

52:30.473 --> 52:32.805
So he's lost his nut.

52:34.778 --> 52:36.211
Extraordinary, 10 out of 10.

52:36.413 --> 52:38.847
He had an episode.
I gave him a sedative.

52:39.048 --> 52:41.881
The next day he told me not to worry,
that he'd talked to God.

52:43.420 --> 52:47.618
Doc, if I told you I was talking to God,
would you clear me for flight?

52:47.824 --> 52:49.519
I...

52:49.726 --> 52:52.854
Is the SM unfit for command?

52:53.763 --> 52:56.493
I find this a very
uncomfortable conversation, captain.

52:57.133 --> 52:59.658
If I need to assume command,
I'm gonna need your help...

52:59.869 --> 53:01.734
...because the others
won't understand.

53:03.873 --> 53:05.898
We could both hang.

53:10.146 --> 53:12.637
Is your loyalty to the SM
or the Federation?

53:29.933 --> 53:32.094
Don't blame the cook, folks.

53:33.236 --> 53:34.601
The SM goes first.

53:34.804 --> 53:36.795
Just water. Bull, you have mine.

53:37.006 --> 53:37.995
Are you sure, sir?

53:38.208 --> 53:40.506
Well, I'm sure
we'll need your strength.

53:40.710 --> 53:41.699
Thank you, sir.

53:43.880 --> 53:48.476
If you don't mind, can we maybe
say a prayer before we eat?

53:48.685 --> 53:50.118
Of course.

53:53.756 --> 53:55.417
Dr. Wiggs?

53:56.626 --> 53:59.026
Captain Beck, how about you?

54:00.630 --> 54:03.155
I'll be checking the perimeter, sir.

54:06.169 --> 54:10.333
We thank thee, Lord,
for the meal we're about to receive.

54:10.540 --> 54:13.873
Please bless us and keep us.

54:14.077 --> 54:18.070
Protect us from all evil
and guide us...

54:18.281 --> 54:20.306
...that we may know the way to you.

54:20.517 --> 54:21.506
Amen.

54:21.718 --> 54:23.208
- Amen.
- Amen.

54:36.633 --> 54:38.567
Can I ask you a question, sir?

54:38.768 --> 54:39.996
Of course, Bull.

54:40.203 --> 54:42.694
They are gonna come looking for us,
won't they, sir?

54:43.172 --> 54:44.230
Because of you.

54:44.707 --> 54:47.870
We are on a mission
of the greatest importance, Bull.

54:48.077 --> 54:50.443
Even if we do not now
understand our purpose.

54:51.047 --> 54:54.346
Yes, sir.
But we are gonna be rescued.

54:54.551 --> 54:56.610
I mean, you do know that,
don't you?

54:56.819 --> 54:58.719
Because you're psychic.

54:59.989 --> 55:05.723
I know how people around me feel,
and sometimes I can speak to them...

55:05.929 --> 55:08.420
...but no one can predict the future,
Bull.

55:29.252 --> 55:31.686
I have a question for you.

55:31.888 --> 55:32.877
For all of you.

55:37.160 --> 55:38.388
Do you have faith?

55:41.965 --> 55:42.954
I believe.

55:43.166 --> 55:46.101
I know you do, Holly.
Your faith is clear and serene.

55:49.372 --> 55:50.669
I wanna believe too, sir.

55:52.475 --> 55:53.942
I really do.

55:54.911 --> 55:57.573
Well, that's the start of it, Bull.

56:00.984 --> 56:03.680
Dr. Wiggs, how about you?

56:07.056 --> 56:09.354
I believe in you, sir.

56:11.694 --> 56:14.322
Well, careful now, Dr. Wiggs.

56:15.932 --> 56:18.492
See, I'm only a man.

56:21.204 --> 56:22.637
Earthquake.

56:24.574 --> 56:26.007
Incoming!

56:27.143 --> 56:28.838
Incoming!

57:20.196 --> 57:22.892
Help me! Bull!

57:23.099 --> 57:25.567
- Jingo, Jingo.
- Hold on.

57:26.903 --> 57:28.336
Hold on, Jingo.

57:32.942 --> 57:34.500
Come on, come on!

57:44.120 --> 57:45.087
Jesus.

57:55.264 --> 57:56.663
Where's Wiggs?

57:57.166 --> 57:59.327
Dr. Wiggs?

57:59.535 --> 58:01.400
Dr. Wiggs?

58:01.604 --> 58:02.935
Wiggs?

58:03.139 --> 58:04.731
Doc?

58:08.044 --> 58:10.035
Wiggs?

58:10.847 --> 58:12.280
Doc?

58:12.482 --> 58:14.313
Good to see you again, troopers.

58:14.517 --> 58:17.008
You are now all part
of a classified mission.

58:17.220 --> 58:20.678
Talk about it and they will hang you.
Get me?

58:20.890 --> 58:22.949
We get you, sir.

58:23.159 --> 58:26.026
What exactly
is the Marauder program, sir?

58:26.229 --> 58:31.257
- I'm not currently at liberty to say.
- Sir, is the mission survivable, sir?

58:32.935 --> 58:34.994
We'll find out, trooper.

58:35.204 --> 58:37.468
You know what I think, sir?

58:39.942 --> 58:43.537
- What's that, sergeant?
- I think it's a good day to die, sir.

58:43.746 --> 58:46.874
Outstanding.
Glad you feel that way.

58:47.083 --> 58:50.849
Because today, we're headed out
for the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

58:51.053 --> 58:55.319
- Saddle up, troopers.
- Sir, yes, sir.

59:02.899 --> 59:05.129
Hauzer for Lamb.

59:07.036 --> 59:09.800
<i>I'm sorry, general,
Lieutenant Lamb's been transferred.</i>

59:10.006 --> 59:10.995
Where?

59:12.341 --> 59:15.572
<i>I'm sorry, sir, I can't tell you that.</i>

59:31.227 --> 59:32.285
What?

59:36.132 --> 59:39.966
- Dix, come in.
- You are going to hang Lamb?

59:40.736 --> 59:44.001
Little redhead, sad eyes,
big mouth?

59:44.207 --> 59:45.504
Why?

59:45.708 --> 59:47.938
That is what happens
to traitors, Dix.

59:48.144 --> 59:50.635
Seems like you know
all about traitors, admiral.

59:50.847 --> 59:53.338
Maybe I'm looking at one right now.

59:54.450 --> 59:55.849
So you're gonna hang me too?

59:56.052 --> 59:58.247
Well, a lot of that
going around these days.

59:58.454 --> 01:00:00.684
What happens to you
when the council finds out...

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.051
...you suppressed
the sky marshal's rescue call?

01:00:03.259 --> 01:00:05.523
And exactly who would tell them
such a thing?

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:12.697
You give me the coordinates
for Planet OM-1, resign...

01:00:12.935 --> 01:00:14.903
...and I keep my mouth shut.

01:00:15.104 --> 01:00:16.662
I'm sorry, Dix.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.307
But very shortly,
Omar Anoke will be dead...

01:00:20.509 --> 01:00:22.534
...and honored as a hero
of the Federation...

01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:25.179
...and I will be
the next sky marshal.

01:00:27.316 --> 01:00:28.874
Over my dead body.

01:00:29.518 --> 01:00:32.248
That your last request, general?

01:00:48.905 --> 01:00:51.430
<i>Federal Council members
were called together today...</i>

01:00:51.641 --> 01:00:53.836
<i>... by Sky Marshal Anoke
for his weekly report.</i>

01:00:54.043 --> 01:00:56.034
How are you doing, sir?
Good to see you.

01:00:56.245 --> 01:01:00.238
<i>Then... disaster.</i>

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:04.884
<i>A bomb carried by a member of
the Goniff Peace Coalition explodes.</i>

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:06.512
<i>Among the missing:</i>

01:01:06.722 --> 01:01:11.056
<i>Sky Marshal Anoke and
his loyal aide, General Dix Hauzer.</i>

01:01:12.695 --> 01:01:16.290
Today, each and every one of us...

01:01:16.499 --> 01:01:19.297
...has been attacked by a man...

01:01:19.502 --> 01:01:22.062
...who would demand peace
at all costs.

01:01:22.705 --> 01:01:25.799
A man who calls himself a citizen.

01:01:26.008 --> 01:01:29.102
A man who is no better than a Bug.

01:01:29.312 --> 01:01:32.475
<i>- One more day of fighting...
- That man is Elmo Goniff...</i>

01:01:32.682 --> 01:01:35.446
<i>... self-proclaimed pacifist
turned terrorist.</i>

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:38.552
<i>And today, he and other members
of the Goniff Peace Coalition...</i>

01:01:38.754 --> 01:01:41.917
<i>... are wanted in connection
with the council bombing.</i>

01:01:42.124 --> 01:01:44.524
<i>And, hey, citizen, you can help.</i>

01:01:45.127 --> 01:01:48.358
<i>- Know your neighbors?
- Turn that f***ing thing off.</i>

01:01:48.564 --> 01:01:50.794
<i>- Take another look, citizen.
- Who, me?</i>

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.298
<i>You could be living next door
to a big, fat reward.</i>

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.163
<i>If you see something, say something.</i>

01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:02.038
We're in the
Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

01:02:02.244 --> 01:02:04.508
Do you know what that means?
This is a Bug planet.

01:02:04.714 --> 01:02:06.648
They could come for us
at any time, right?

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:10.114
- Upstairs, downstairs, you can't tell.
- Save your breath, Jingo.

01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:13.288
Yeah, but they could be under
our feet right now. You can't tell.

01:02:13.489 --> 01:02:15.787
- You don't know, right?
- Listen to me, okay?

01:02:15.992 --> 01:02:17.391
I'll tell you when to run.

01:02:17.593 --> 01:02:20.585
No, you can't tell me when to run,
because I'm a cook, okay?

01:02:20.796 --> 01:02:22.787
I take short orders, I'm not a...

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.300
Get your shit wired.

01:02:28.004 --> 01:02:28.993
You're a bitch.

01:02:36.746 --> 01:02:38.008
Let's move.

01:02:46.389 --> 01:02:50.382
- You're wasting water, Jingo.
- I hate you.

01:03:10.012 --> 01:03:12.879
- Oh, God.
- It's okay, Holly.

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:15.942
Oh, that's it, I'm out of here.

01:03:16.152 --> 01:03:18.086
Hold your ground, Jingo.
That's an order.

01:03:21.557 --> 01:03:23.752
Captain Beck, we need to talk.

01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:27.987
We're fucked.

01:03:28.197 --> 01:03:29.858
That's exactly
what I've been saying.

01:03:30.066 --> 01:03:32.227
You shouldn't talk like that.
That's blasphemy.

01:03:32.435 --> 01:03:35.962
You're a goddamn flight attendant,
so stow it.

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.708
We never should have left
the goddamn beach.

01:03:39.909 --> 01:03:41.274
This is all a big mistake.

01:03:42.711 --> 01:03:44.144
Now we got warriors...

01:03:45.881 --> 01:03:48.907
...fucking earthquakes,
and we even lost the doc.

01:03:49.118 --> 01:03:52.610
Did you forget that?
And it's your fault.

01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:55.753
You know,
if we'd stayed at the beach...

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:58.256
...then we could just be lying
in the sand.

01:03:58.461 --> 01:04:02.022
And if the Bugs did show up,
well, then we just jump in the water.

01:04:02.231 --> 01:04:05.928
I mean, Bugs don't swim, right?
Do they?

01:04:06.168 --> 01:04:08.136
- Jingo, behind you.
- Jingo, watch your back.

01:04:13.042 --> 01:04:14.771
Yeah. Very funny.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:19.136
You know what? Screw you guys.
I'm going back to the beach.

01:04:19.482 --> 01:04:20.471
- Jingo.
- Jingo.

01:04:35.965 --> 01:04:37.557
Jingo, don't.

01:04:37.766 --> 01:04:39.199
Hold on, Jingo.

01:04:42.805 --> 01:04:44.170
Damn it.

01:04:56.018 --> 01:04:57.747
Fucker.

01:04:59.655 --> 01:05:00.986
It's moving off.

01:05:01.724 --> 01:05:04.818
Hold your fire. Save the ammo.

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.961
- Jingo, get out of there, now.
- No way.

01:05:08.164 --> 01:05:10.132
We ought to get in there with him.
Let's go.

01:05:10.332 --> 01:05:14.166
Chief, those aren't rocks.
Get out of there now.

01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:18.773
- Come on, Holly, let's go. Sir, let's go.
- No, my friends.

01:05:18.974 --> 01:05:20.202
He belongs to God.

01:05:22.545 --> 01:05:23.876
What are you talking about?

01:05:49.538 --> 01:05:51.096
No.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.959
No, no.

01:06:13.162 --> 01:06:14.754
No.

01:06:26.442 --> 01:06:28.103
And where's your God now?

01:06:33.015 --> 01:06:34.209
Let's move.

01:06:34.416 --> 01:06:37.510
Even though you don't believe it,
captain, he is listening.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:41.884
- And soon, we will be delivered.
- Do you really believe that, sir?

01:06:43.492 --> 01:06:45.392
Yes, Holly.

01:06:46.862 --> 01:06:48.921
I do.

01:06:56.238 --> 01:06:57.398
How do you know?

01:06:57.606 --> 01:07:01.007
Because he talks to me even now,
Captain Beck.

01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:04.970
He talks to me even now.

01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:21.755
All right, listen up.
The hardware you'll be operating...

01:07:21.964 --> 01:07:24.455
...interfaces directly
with your nervous system.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:26.601
That's outstanding, sir.

01:07:27.736 --> 01:07:29.260
Please remove your clothing.

01:07:39.682 --> 01:07:41.843
What are you gonna do
if you don't buy the farm?

01:07:42.051 --> 01:07:44.849
I'm thinking R and R.
They might even let us go home.

01:07:45.054 --> 01:07:46.453
Home? What's that?

01:07:46.655 --> 01:07:50.523
Peace and quiet, family.
Remember?

01:07:50.726 --> 01:07:52.626
Yeah, that's all I want
when this is done.

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:56.631
Yeah, I just can't wait for it to be over
and start living again.

01:07:56.832 --> 01:07:58.390
Hasn't anybody told you,
sergeants?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.864
Mobile Infantry
is only good for dying.

01:08:01.437 --> 01:08:03.462
They need to come up
with a bigger weapon...

01:08:03.672 --> 01:08:06.038
...so they can finish this thing
and we can go home.

01:08:06.241 --> 01:08:09.802
Yeah. Bye-bye, Bugs.

01:08:10.012 --> 01:08:12.981
What will you do
when the war is over, sir?

01:08:13.182 --> 01:08:16.640
What are you people talking about?
This war is never gonna end.

01:08:34.803 --> 01:08:36.703
<i>Take your place, number two.</i>

01:08:43.746 --> 01:08:46.044
I guess that's why
his mama called him Slug.

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.979
Prepare for full-spectrum bioscan.

01:08:51.754 --> 01:08:53.721
<i>DDQ, five-by-five.</i>

01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.390
<i>Commencing Gamma Jetta Bonza.</i>

01:09:31.693 --> 01:09:35.857
Did you participate in Anoke's
interrogation of the Brain, general?

01:09:36.064 --> 01:09:37.053
No.

01:09:37.265 --> 01:09:39.461
So you don't know
about the side effects?

01:09:40.202 --> 01:09:42.295
What side effects?

01:09:43.138 --> 01:09:45.868
It seems anybody who spends
too much time around that Bug...

01:09:46.073 --> 01:09:50.408
...suffers deleterious effects,
both physical and psychological.

01:09:50.612 --> 01:09:53.376
- Not the sky marshal.
- So it seemed.

01:09:53.582 --> 01:09:56.449
Truth is, we didn't fully understand
the Brain's capabilities.

01:10:10.966 --> 01:10:14.333
- Sir.
- Welcome to Area 6, admiral.

01:10:15.437 --> 01:10:18.201
- Necessary personnel only.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:18.407 --> 01:10:21.934
<i>All unauthorized personnel,
exit Area 6 immediately.</i>

01:10:22.377 --> 01:10:25.642
<i>All unauthorized personnel,
exit Area 6 immediately.</i>

01:10:30.252 --> 01:10:33.449
So, general, how well
did you really know the sky marshal?

01:10:33.655 --> 01:10:36.089
I worked with him every day.

01:10:39.895 --> 01:10:41.954
So you knew he got religion.

01:10:42.731 --> 01:10:44.961
- What are you talking about?
- General.

01:10:45.167 --> 01:10:47.931
There's something
I think you should see.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.635
Run the Anoke file.

01:10:57.112 --> 01:11:00.172
This is surveillance footage of Anoke
with the Brain Bug.

01:11:00.415 --> 01:11:01.905
We just recently discovered it.

01:11:02.117 --> 01:11:06.076
He's psychically connected with it.
They communicate.

01:11:06.288 --> 01:11:08.483
<i>I understand.</i>

01:11:09.424 --> 01:11:11.688
<i>And I come here as your servant,
Behemecoytal.</i>

01:11:12.594 --> 01:11:16.553
- That thing has a name?
- Yeah. But that's not this Bug.

01:11:16.765 --> 01:11:19.996
Behemecoytal is likely some Bug
we've never encountered before.

01:11:20.202 --> 01:11:24.764
A superior arachnid intelligence
originating on the planet OM-1.

01:11:26.174 --> 01:11:27.163
OM-1?

01:11:27.376 --> 01:11:29.742
We believe this Brain
allowed itself to be captured.

01:11:29.978 --> 01:11:32.742
To provide intelligence
from the heart of the Federation.

01:11:32.948 --> 01:11:35.610
And Anoke used the Brain
to commune with this Behemecoytal.

01:11:35.817 --> 01:11:37.045
A Bug he regards as God.

01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:40.278
<i>Yes, Roku San will fall
as proof of my faith.</i>

01:11:40.489 --> 01:11:43.219
<i>Then we can discuss
the terms of peace.</i>

01:11:44.026 --> 01:11:46.426
Anoke's responsible for Roku San?

01:11:48.063 --> 01:11:50.224
He had the codes
to shut down the fences.

01:11:50.432 --> 01:11:53.595
He made a pact with the Bug
to render Roku San defenseless.

01:11:53.802 --> 01:11:57.533
And in light of his conversion...

01:11:58.006 --> 01:12:02.136
...he's become an asset to the Bugs
and a tremendous liability for us.

01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:10.885
- Making friends?
- You can't be friends with a Bug.

01:12:11.086 --> 01:12:13.020
That's why
we're gonna put this one down...

01:12:13.221 --> 01:12:15.621
...take it apart,
and find out what it knows.

01:12:23.165 --> 01:12:24.826
Close the containment.

01:13:13.015 --> 01:13:15.483
Admiral, you okay?

01:13:16.018 --> 01:13:17.781
Yeah.

01:13:19.287 --> 01:13:20.914
Yeah.

01:13:21.123 --> 01:13:22.852
Look at him.

01:13:23.058 --> 01:13:26.050
The most powerful man in the galaxy
finds God...

01:13:26.261 --> 01:13:28.229
...and what does he do?

01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:30.057
Exactly what he's told.

01:13:30.766 --> 01:13:32.393
He's a Bug.

01:13:32.601 --> 01:13:36.298
Doesn't think, doesn't protest,
doesn't rebel.

01:13:36.872 --> 01:13:39.705
That's the kind of attitude
that wins wars.

01:13:40.175 --> 01:13:42.143
You know, Dix...

01:13:42.644 --> 01:13:44.874
...I think these Bugs
are onto something.

01:13:50.018 --> 01:13:53.545
This could just be
the greatest weapon of them all.

01:13:59.895 --> 01:14:01.886
How does he do it?

01:14:02.097 --> 01:14:05.032
That's faith, Bull.
That's what it does for a man.

01:14:05.233 --> 01:14:06.825
Give it a break.

01:14:07.035 --> 01:14:09.595
Faith is more powerful
than a Q-bomb.

01:14:09.805 --> 01:14:11.272
Without it, you're nobody.

01:14:11.473 --> 01:14:14.874
That's why I'm not listening
to you anymore, captain.

01:14:16.344 --> 01:14:20.974
Holly, if we ever get out of this,
I was wondering if...

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:24.108
Well...

01:14:26.388 --> 01:14:29.118
What is it, Bull?

01:14:30.592 --> 01:14:32.856
Would you ever marry
an old monkey wrench like me?

01:14:33.562 --> 01:14:36.087
Only in a church, Bull.

01:14:36.298 --> 01:14:37.925
You mean it?

01:14:38.366 --> 01:14:41.563
You take God and you can take me.

01:14:45.407 --> 01:14:47.375
What we've come for.

01:14:47.909 --> 01:14:49.706
It's here.

01:14:54.716 --> 01:14:58.049
I never doubted it for a second, sir.

01:14:58.253 --> 01:15:01.120
If I didn't believe before, I do now.

01:15:01.323 --> 01:15:04.349
- Honey, everything's gonna be okay.
- All will be well, Bull.

01:15:05.227 --> 01:15:07.661
And you will know
the name of God.

01:15:07.863 --> 01:15:10.229
The one true God.

01:15:10.432 --> 01:15:11.729
Behemecoytal.

01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:15.060
Brain of Brains.

01:15:15.771 --> 01:15:19.104
- Beheme-what?
- Behemecoytal.

01:15:19.307 --> 01:15:22.799
He's here. He's everywhere.

01:15:23.678 --> 01:15:27.671
Come, and let us rest
and wait for his coming.

01:15:29.851 --> 01:15:33.116
They say God has many names,
but I've never heard that one before.

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:36.347
Well, honey, he's the sky marshal.
He knows a lot more than we do.

01:15:36.558 --> 01:15:37.923
He's talking about a Bug.

01:15:38.393 --> 01:15:40.122
He thinks God is a Bug?

01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:44.025
He's got religion. Their religion.

01:15:44.232 --> 01:15:47.030
- Bug religion?
- That's crazy.

01:15:47.235 --> 01:15:48.668
That's blasphemy.

01:15:49.738 --> 01:15:51.729
What do we do now?

01:15:52.641 --> 01:15:53.938
Maybe we should kill him.

01:15:55.177 --> 01:15:59.477
Why, because he's crazy?
Or he believes in God like you?

01:16:02.484 --> 01:16:05.351
It's the wrong God.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.361
- Guard the door.
- I'm no trooper.

01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:58.266
Greetings, citizen.

01:17:23.298 --> 01:17:25.232
Excuse me, sir.

01:17:37.579 --> 01:17:40.047
- What went wrong?
- An air leak.

01:17:40.248 --> 01:17:41.647
The ship landed itself.

01:17:43.318 --> 01:17:45.946
They were dead
before they hit the atmosphere.

01:18:05.507 --> 01:18:07.941
Sierra Mike Uniform
to Fleet Rescue.

01:18:08.443 --> 01:18:10.673
Come in, Fleet.

01:18:13.915 --> 01:18:16.816
Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.
Come in, Fleet.

01:18:17.018 --> 01:18:19.486
We could make orbit
if I can solve the O2 problem.

01:18:19.688 --> 01:18:21.849
Solve it, chief.

01:18:22.457 --> 01:18:24.925
Sierra Mike Uniform
to Fleet Rescue.

01:18:25.126 --> 01:18:26.616
Come in.

01:18:27.429 --> 01:18:31.263
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform,
this is Fleet Rescue, over.</i>

01:18:31.466 --> 01:18:34.697
We are requesting priority pickup
on Planet Oscar Mike-One...

01:18:34.903 --> 01:18:37.531
...for SM
and three additional survivors.

01:19:44.706 --> 01:19:45.730
Holly, don't move.

01:19:49.411 --> 01:19:51.174
Let's go, baby.

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.644
Go, baby.

01:20:07.128 --> 01:20:08.857
Bull.

01:20:17.338 --> 01:20:19.431
No!

01:20:19.874 --> 01:20:22.104
No!

01:20:22.977 --> 01:20:24.035
It's all around.

01:20:24.245 --> 01:20:27.305
- It's Behemecoytal.
- No, it's hell.

01:20:27.515 --> 01:20:29.813
- Come on, Holly.
- We're in hell!

01:20:30.018 --> 01:20:32.282
Clear the door, Holly.

01:20:37.425 --> 01:20:40.258
We may not be able to make orbit.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:55.441
- But we can sure get out of here.
- We must remain here, captain.

01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:57.167
No, sir, we are off this rock.

01:22:10.919 --> 01:22:14.082
Oh, great one. Lord.

01:22:14.722 --> 01:22:17.316
The day has arrived
that I stand before you.

01:22:17.525 --> 01:22:19.823
Let our communion begin.

01:22:23.932 --> 01:22:25.365
Yes.

01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:27.801
Yes.

01:22:28.036 --> 01:22:30.527
It's time to talk.

01:22:31.372 --> 01:22:32.703
Jingo, is that you?

01:22:33.408 --> 01:22:38.209
This one speaks for us
that we may talk to you as a man.

01:22:38.413 --> 01:22:42.406
That you may be comfortable
among your own kind.

01:22:43.218 --> 01:22:46.881
Among your trusted advisors
and servants...

01:22:47.088 --> 01:22:49.215
...whom we have made believers.

01:22:50.725 --> 01:22:52.625
Thank you, Lord.

01:22:53.228 --> 01:22:55.355
That you care for me so much...

01:22:55.563 --> 01:22:59.124
...fills me with love and joy
and confidence...

01:22:59.334 --> 01:23:03.668
...that we can and will create
a great new understanding.

01:23:03.871 --> 01:23:06.533
You will be one with us.

01:23:07.141 --> 01:23:08.938
So that I may come to know you.

01:23:09.143 --> 01:23:11.577
You will know what we know.

01:23:14.682 --> 01:23:18.982
And that you will come to know me,
and through me...

01:23:19.187 --> 01:23:21.951
...all of humankind.

01:23:22.624 --> 01:23:23.613
What are you doing?

01:23:23.825 --> 01:23:26.419
I am here to negotiate peace
with a being superior to us.

01:23:26.628 --> 01:23:28.789
- What, appeasement?
- No, Captain Beck.

01:23:28.997 --> 01:23:32.057
The survival of the human race.
We will all be saved.

01:23:36.471 --> 01:23:39.668
Forgive me.
My people have much to learn.

01:23:39.874 --> 01:23:45.813
- They are fearful and...
- As were you once, Anoke.

01:23:46.014 --> 01:23:47.606
I was weak.

01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:52.377
When you asked for the lives
of so many at Roku San, I doubted.

01:23:52.587 --> 01:23:55.112
But now I understand
that great achievement...

01:23:55.323 --> 01:23:57.791
...requires great sacrifice.

01:23:57.992 --> 01:23:59.789
You gave them Roku San.

01:24:01.963 --> 01:24:03.157
Traitor.

01:24:11.406 --> 01:24:14.000
Within that woman
you will find Sanctuary.

01:24:14.208 --> 01:24:17.700
I have given you the key that will end
this conflict once and for all...

01:24:17.912 --> 01:24:20.813
...so that your law may rule
and paradise follow...

01:24:21.015 --> 01:24:23.108
You're a liar. Seducer.

01:24:23.318 --> 01:24:25.946
He of a thousand names.

01:24:28.289 --> 01:24:31.087
Oh, great one, Lord...

01:24:31.292 --> 01:24:34.420
...would you please take
these women from me and kill them?

01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:38.198
And why do you wish this?

01:24:38.399 --> 01:24:40.594
I have made this great journey.

01:24:41.102 --> 01:24:43.366
I have evolved.

01:24:43.571 --> 01:24:45.163
I have sacrificed all...

01:24:45.373 --> 01:24:48.672
...so that I may create with you
a great peace.

01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:50.901
And they're fucking it up.

01:24:51.112 --> 01:24:55.811
We too seek peace,
but by different means.

01:24:56.017 --> 01:24:59.316
We seek knowledge.

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.715
Knowledge is the key
to understanding...

01:25:01.923 --> 01:25:03.584
...and to communication.

01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:06.555
And only by this way
can our species...

01:25:06.761 --> 01:25:11.698
...so different, live together
in harmony and mutual resp...

01:25:18.139 --> 01:25:21.074
You will become one with us...

01:25:21.275 --> 01:25:24.676
...and provide
the knowledge necessary...

01:25:24.879 --> 01:25:28.872
...to pacify the human species.

01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:33.643
Oh, Lord. Yes.

01:25:33.855 --> 01:25:38.383
Your plans,
the disposition of your armies...

01:25:39.026 --> 01:25:40.357
...your fleet.

01:25:40.862 --> 01:25:43.126
Yes, what's mine is yours.

01:25:54.409 --> 01:25:57.674
Take me unto you, oh, great one.

01:25:57.879 --> 01:25:59.403
Yes.

01:26:02.016 --> 01:26:03.608
Yes.

01:26:16.531 --> 01:26:17.725
Pray with me, Lola.

01:26:18.566 --> 01:26:19.794
What?

01:26:20.001 --> 01:26:25.667
Lord, please hear my prayer.
Deliver us from this evil place.

01:26:25.873 --> 01:26:30.572
- Come on, Lola, pray with me.
- It doesn't make any difference.

01:26:31.679 --> 01:26:35.115
Lord, send us an army of angels.

01:26:35.650 --> 01:26:39.746
And arm them with your fire
and your sword...

01:26:39.954 --> 01:26:42.115
...that they might smite
the evil around us.

01:26:45.059 --> 01:26:47.027
What is it, Lola?

01:26:48.429 --> 01:26:49.589
Lola, what is it?

01:26:51.165 --> 01:26:53.531
Come on, Lola,
don't you wanna live?

01:26:53.734 --> 01:26:54.723
Yes, I wanna live.

01:26:54.936 --> 01:26:57.564
Well, when you're all out of hope,
God is all you get.

01:26:57.772 --> 01:26:59.171
Now, say it.

01:26:59.373 --> 01:27:01.466
- Our father.
- Our father.

01:27:01.676 --> 01:27:04.543
- Who art in heaven.
- Who art in heaven.

01:27:04.745 --> 01:27:07.305
Hallowed be they name.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.219
- Thy kingdom come.
- Thy kingdom come.

01:27:21.429 --> 01:27:23.363
- Thy will be done.
- Thy will be done.

01:27:23.564 --> 01:27:26.226
- On Earth as it is in heaven.
- On Earth as it is in heaven.

01:27:44.585 --> 01:27:48.715
<i>All right, troopers, let's fix this hive.
Archies everywhere.</i>

01:27:53.361 --> 01:27:55.352
<i>As we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

01:27:55.563 --> 01:27:58.896
<i>- Searching for survivors.
- And lead us not into temptation.</i>

01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.931
<i>- Got them.
- And deliver us from evil.</i>

01:28:01.135 --> 01:28:02.363
Let's move in.

01:28:03.137 --> 01:28:05.071
<i>Rolling in.</i>

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.374
Rolling in.

01:28:14.715 --> 01:28:16.444
<i>We got visual.</i>

01:28:18.052 --> 01:28:20.077
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

01:28:27.395 --> 01:28:29.420
<i>Wait for my command.</i>

01:28:32.266 --> 01:28:35.030
<i>- We got visual, we got contact.
- Wait for it.</i>

01:28:36.237 --> 01:28:38.603
<i>Ready. Wait for it.</i>

01:28:40.975 --> 01:28:42.738
<i>We got contact.</i>

01:28:42.944 --> 01:28:44.241
I'm moving in for guns.

01:28:46.314 --> 01:28:48.282
<i>Keep your cool.</i>

01:28:49.483 --> 01:28:51.713
Hold that line, trooper.

01:28:55.289 --> 01:28:56.352
Say it again, Lola. Say it again.

01:28:57.625 --> 01:29:00.992
- Our father who art in heaven.
- Who art in heaven.

01:29:01.195 --> 01:29:03.663
- Hallowed by thy name.
- Hallowed by thy name.

01:29:08.035 --> 01:29:09.559
<i>Fire in the hole.</i>

01:29:11.839 --> 01:29:15.138
- On Earth as it is in heaven.
- On Earth as it is in heaven.

01:29:16.210 --> 01:29:17.734
<i>Open up.</i>

01:29:17.945 --> 01:29:19.173
Everything you got.

01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.280
<i>Initiate wide dispersal on my mark.</i>

01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:24.910
<i>- Three, two...
- And forgive us our trespasses.</i>

01:29:25.119 --> 01:29:26.848
<i>Fire!</i>

01:29:31.359 --> 01:29:33.657
<i>Weed them out. Nothing lives.</i>

01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:43.163
<i>Get some, get some, get some.</i>

01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:50.609
<i>Archie.</i>

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.270
<i>Dual target.</i>

01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:57.843
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:29:59.487 --> 01:30:02.285
All right, cook them.

01:30:48.335 --> 01:30:51.168
Come on, Lola, let's go home.

01:31:31.879 --> 01:31:33.744
You killed a lot of Bugs
down there, John.

01:31:33.948 --> 01:31:37.076
- Too bad the big one got away.
- Well, it's a big Bug.

01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:40.048
Our guys can't tell where
the Bug ends and the planet begins.

01:31:40.254 --> 01:31:42.654
Hard to imagine anything
could live through all that.

01:31:42.857 --> 01:31:46.054
- I did.
- You're hard to kill.

01:31:52.967 --> 01:31:55.299
<i>The Bug is big.</i>

01:31:55.603 --> 01:31:57.400
<i>We have lock.</i>

01:31:59.707 --> 01:32:01.607
Captain Beck.

01:32:01.809 --> 01:32:04.209
I've heard a lot about you.

01:32:04.712 --> 01:32:06.771
I'm hoping you'll take command
of my flagship.

01:32:06.981 --> 01:32:08.812
But when you've had
a little time off.

01:32:09.016 --> 01:32:10.142
Yes, ma'am.

01:32:11.352 --> 01:32:14.253
Congratulations, Colonel Rico.
Marauder is a big success.

01:32:14.455 --> 01:32:16.650
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, thank Dix.

01:32:16.857 --> 01:32:20.088
My new number two
doesn't always take no for an answer.

01:32:21.395 --> 01:32:25.331
I wasn't sure we should mix
business with pleasure.

01:32:31.305 --> 01:32:34.433
- Are we ready to deploy the Q-bomb?
- On your command.

01:32:34.642 --> 01:32:38.373
All right, people.
Let's go crack a planet.

01:32:44.084 --> 01:32:46.780
So they wanna make you
a general, John.

01:32:46.987 --> 01:32:49.353
Put you in charge
of the whole Marauder program.

01:32:52.226 --> 01:32:54.023
I'm only good for one thing, Dix.

01:32:54.228 --> 01:32:56.128
Give me a squad and let me fight.

01:32:56.630 --> 01:32:58.825
At least think about it.

01:33:00.267 --> 01:33:01.632
Maybe you two wanna be alone.

01:33:03.037 --> 01:33:04.265
I'll see you on the bounce.

01:33:09.844 --> 01:33:12.677
<i>Alpha Gamma Bonza. Now.</i>

01:33:13.881 --> 01:33:16.281
I wanted to ask you...

01:33:17.818 --> 01:33:19.809
Would you?

01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:24.020
I will.

01:33:24.491 --> 01:33:26.118
Really?

01:33:27.027 --> 01:33:30.190
- That's wonderful.
- But you need to know one thing.

01:33:30.397 --> 01:33:31.591
Yeah?

01:33:31.799 --> 01:33:34.768
Something happened to me
down there and...

01:33:34.969 --> 01:33:36.630
<i>Thirty seconds to impact.</i>

01:33:36.837 --> 01:33:40.170
- Something that I can't explain.
- What?

01:33:40.908 --> 01:33:44.810
But if you wanna marry me,
we have to do it in a church.

01:33:45.012 --> 01:33:47.503
<i>- What?
- Twenty seconds to impact.</i>

01:33:47.715 --> 01:33:51.617
I got religion, Dix. I got it bad.

01:33:51.819 --> 01:33:53.411
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

01:33:53.621 --> 01:33:57.819
Well, nobody's perfect.

01:33:58.325 --> 01:34:03.729
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:06.456
<i>We have detonation.</i>

01:34:20.948 --> 01:34:25.544
<i>Sure, he's gone,
but he left us with a song.</i>

01:34:34.228 --> 01:34:35.991
<i>Courage.</i>

01:34:37.197 --> 01:34:38.892
<i>Duty.</i>

01:34:40.367 --> 01:34:42.096
<i>Honor.</i>

01:34:47.308 --> 01:34:50.835
<i>Millions mourn the passing
of Sky Marshal Omar Anoke.</i>

01:34:51.045 --> 01:34:55.175
<i>Warrior, philosopher,
a hero of the Federation.</i>

01:35:09.196 --> 01:35:12.654
<i>Across the Federation,
federal experts agree that, A...</i>

01:35:12.866 --> 01:35:16.029
<i>... God exists after all,
B, he's on our side...</i>

01:35:16.236 --> 01:35:18.830
<i>... and, C, he wants us to win.</i>

01:35:19.039 --> 01:35:21.473
And there's even
more good news, believers.

01:35:21.675 --> 01:35:25.611
Because it's official. God's back.

01:35:25.813 --> 01:35:28.373
And he's a citizen too.

01:35:28.582 --> 01:35:31.244
<i>Bowing to a rise in popularity
all across the Federation...</i>

01:35:31.452 --> 01:35:34.910
<i>... Sky Marshal Phid declares
that while religion is acceptable...</i>

01:35:35.122 --> 01:35:37.147
<i>... peace is not.</i>

01:35:37.358 --> 01:35:40.350
<i>In related news,
peace terrorist Elmo Goniff...</i>

01:35:40.561 --> 01:35:43.962
<i>... and 51 of his closest friends
were hung this morning...</i>

01:35:44.164 --> 01:35:47.258
<i>... in what many believe to be
the all-time record for executions...</i>

01:35:47.468 --> 01:35:51.199
<i>... in a single day
since the 21 st century.</i>

01:35:51.405 --> 01:35:53.100
But they can't silence you.

01:35:53.307 --> 01:35:56.936
F*** the Federation and f*** all of you!
You will not take my voice!

01:35:57.144 --> 01:36:00.079
You will not take me!
You will not take away our power!

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.374
F*** you all! F*** you! F*** you all!

01:36:03.584 --> 01:36:04.778
F*** the Federation!

01:36:04.985 --> 01:36:07.351
<i>War heroes take time out
to tie the knot.</i>

01:36:09.056 --> 01:36:10.546
<i>Get back to work, troopers.</i>

01:36:10.758 --> 01:36:14.125
<i>Didn't anyone tell you?
There's a war on.</i>

01:36:14.995 --> 01:36:17.987
<i>So join up, do your part.</i>

01:36:18.198 --> 01:36:22.862
<i>There's a long war ahead,
and we need you.</i>

01:36:36.583 --> 01:36:38.380
Are you ready for Marauder?

01:36:38.585 --> 01:36:39.813
Join the Mobile Infantry...

01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.716
...and see if you've got what it takes
to be a citizen.

01:36:42.923 --> 01:36:45.653
See you on the bounce, trooper.

01:36:47.094 --> 01:36:49.507
<i>Service guarantees citizenship.</i>
