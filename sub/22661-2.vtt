00:03.271 --> 00:05.739
Gentlemen, I got a problem.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.309
I've gathered you here because I
need the smartest guys I know.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.112
My life is what it is,
so that's you.

00:12.446 --> 00:16.450
He's talking to you
guys, so step it up.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.752
Yesterday, I was the only one
home and the doorbell rings.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.321
It was Carl Tompkins.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.323
That son of a bitch.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.325
Who's Carl Tompkins?

00:24.358 --> 00:26.794
Pastor Carl? The guy who married
me and Andi at our wedding.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.130
That son of a bitch.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.099
Dad, will you listen, please?

00:31.132 --> 00:32.633
He gave me some very bad news.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.303
17 years ago, when I
married you and Andi,

00:35.336 --> 00:37.371
I had a nasty gambling problem.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.808
But I'm in a program now,
and I'm on the ninth step,

00:40.841 --> 00:43.177
which is making amends.

00:43.211 --> 00:46.447
Amends? That's never good.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.349
When I did your ceremony,
I was broke,

00:48.382 --> 00:50.451
so I hadn't renewed
my credentials.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.620
I forged your paperwork
and your marriage isn't legal.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.422
What?

00:54.455 --> 00:56.390
We're not legally married?

00:56.424 --> 00:58.159
But why would you
do the ceremony

00:58.192 --> 00:59.460
if you knew
it wasn't real?

00:59.493 --> 01:01.862
I just love
making people happy.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.398
Do I look happy now?

01:04.432 --> 01:06.700
So I was right--
he is a son of a bitch.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.237
Andi's not
gonna like this.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.604
But she's not
gonna blame Adam.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.573
It's not your fault the guy
had a gambling problem.

01:12.606 --> 01:16.510
See, this is
where it gets tricky.

01:16.544 --> 01:19.447
H-He's not the guy
Andi told me to hire.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.614
I picked him
'cause he was cheaper.

01:20.648 --> 01:23.451
Oh, Adam.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.619
What? Well, I had
to do something.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.322
Look, we agreed on a simple
courthouse ceremony,

01:28.356 --> 01:29.857
then the bride magazines
started showing up

01:29.890 --> 01:31.425
and everything got expensive.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.427
She wanted to move it
to the Bahamas.

01:33.461 --> 01:34.895
I had to show her a bunch
of shark attack videos

01:34.928 --> 01:37.165
just to keep it on the mainland.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.366
So you're not legally married?

01:38.399 --> 01:39.467
And it's your fault.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.634
And Andi doesn't know.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.770
That's pretty much it.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.738
Yeah, you're gonna need
smarter guys.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.143
*

01:58.452 --> 02:00.354
First of all, I am
really pumped to be included

02:00.388 --> 02:02.323
in this advice circle.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.524
We don't name our meetings,
Lowell.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.226
And if we did, it would
be something cool,

02:05.259 --> 02:07.695
like "war council."

02:07.728 --> 02:11.865
But a wedding is not something
to cut corners on.

02:11.899 --> 02:15.369
You blew it, bubba.
Sorry for the language.

02:15.403 --> 02:18.239
Money is for saving,
not spending.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.807
That's right, and you're
gonna need that money

02:19.840 --> 02:21.242
when the storm comes.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.244
And there is always
a storm coming.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.545
You taught us that, Pop.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.247
I'm never not afraid.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.283
Damn straight.
It keeps you frosty.
Mm-hmm.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.519
So how do I tell Andi
we're not legally married

02:31.552 --> 02:33.187
because I wanted to save
a few bucks?

02:33.221 --> 02:35.523
Now, keep in mind,
not being married might be

02:35.556 --> 02:37.725
a hot-button issue for her.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.861
Well, you could
soften her up with some romance.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.431
Ooh, take her to
a nice hotel for a weekend.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.665
I don't like the idea
of being locked

02:44.698 --> 02:47.368
in a tiny room with her
when she finds out.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.570
Whenever I've screwed
up with Marcy--

02:49.603 --> 02:52.540
and it has happened--

02:52.573 --> 02:54.375
I tell her I did
something much worse,

02:54.408 --> 02:55.909
and then when I tell
her the real thing,

02:55.943 --> 02:57.711
(exhales)
she's relieved.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.448
So what could I tell Andi
that's worse than this?

03:00.481 --> 03:01.849
Nothing.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.352
I was just saying, you know,

03:04.385 --> 03:05.919
if you'd done something
not so big,

03:05.953 --> 03:07.655
that would be the solution.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.492
This is the worst war council
I've ever been on.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.995
Son, you got to think
outside the box.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.798
Men have been screwing up with
women for thousands of years.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.233
They're on to us.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.835
You need something new.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.938
So your idea is:
come up with a good idea.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.641
That's right.
Run with that.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.644
Okay. Well, a lot of good
perspectives here.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.846
But the thing is, Andi
is the best, all right?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.648
I got a good one,
so I'm just gonna go home

03:34.682 --> 03:36.384
and tell her;
she'll understand.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.585
Attaboy.
Absolutely.
Good for you.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.556
He's not coming
back from this.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.657
He's a dead man.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.527
I should have told him
I loved him.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.732
Hey, sweetie.
Hey.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.667
You'll never guess what happened
at work today.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.668
I hope it was good.

03:54.702 --> 03:55.736
It's so good.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.738
Okay. I finally figured out

03:57.771 --> 04:00.674
who's been microwaving fish in
the break room. It was Karen.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.611
Yeah. We're gonna have
a whole meeting about it

04:03.644 --> 04:05.746
and everything.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.582
Yeah. Funny thing happened
to me today, too. Get this.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.684
Wait. Wait.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.720
Babe, what's this? They didn't
have the organic chicken?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.588
No, no, they did, but we'll
get to that in a minute.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.457
Yeah.
Okay, but, um,

04:16.490 --> 04:18.359
I thought we agreed we
were gonna go organic.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.493
Remember? We watched
that documentary.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.929
You cried a little.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.498
Then I saw how much
organic chicken costs,

04:24.532 --> 04:25.666
and I cried more.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.735
They just charge you
twice as much

04:27.768 --> 04:30.471
'cause they slap
a fancy label on it.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.906
Okay, Adam, we've
talked about this.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.508
Don't be cheap.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.945
Well-- I am not cheap,
I am frugal.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.780
Okay, see what you did there?

04:39.813 --> 04:42.583
You just took "cheap" and you
slapped a fancy label on it.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.486
Okay, this isn't a big deal,
it's just chicken,

04:45.519 --> 04:47.087
but I-I do need to...

04:47.120 --> 04:50.991
Okay, look, Adam, we both
know it's not just chicken.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.861
I mean, like, for example,
all of our napkins

04:53.894 --> 04:56.630
come from fast food places.

04:56.664 --> 05:00.668
You should never have
to pay for napkins.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.471
They're free everywhere.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.872
And when company comes over,

05:04.905 --> 05:07.708
we put out the good ones
from Arby's.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.680
Okay. Let's talk about
our coffee situation.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.449
These coffee pods
come 12 to a box,

05:15.483 --> 05:18.486
but somehow every box
seems to last us for a month.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.424
I did not know that
you noticed that.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.726
Oh, I did.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.461
Says right on it,

05:27.495 --> 05:30.097
"single use only."

05:32.466 --> 05:34.435
You've been double dripping,
haven't you?

05:35.469 --> 05:38.606
You're damn right I have.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.907
They would love for you to
only use each pod once.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.675
That's their whole scam.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.076
I bet you there's a
documentary about that.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.481
Okay, Adam, it's not a scam,
okay?

05:47.515 --> 05:48.749
I've been drinking brown water

05:48.782 --> 05:50.818
and falling asleep at 10:30
in the morning.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.153
Okay, you know
I love a bargain.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.657
But isn't it fun when you
find out and we have a laugh?

05:56.690 --> 05:57.791
Huh?

05:57.825 --> 05:59.126
Yeah, so fun.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.030
Hey, um, let me ask you
something.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.799
Last week, when you made
the reservation

06:05.833 --> 06:07.735
for our family trip
to Keystone Lake,

06:07.768 --> 06:10.838
um...

06:10.871 --> 06:13.841
you said that the hotel
right on the water was full,

06:13.874 --> 06:17.911
so that we had to stay at the
cheap one six blocks away.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.013
Yeah.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.015
Yeah. I-I-I-I told you that

06:22.049 --> 06:24.051
because that's what happened.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.755
And if I'm remembering
right, and I hope I am,

06:27.788 --> 06:30.758
I said there was a convention.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.093
Uh-huh. So if I call
the good hotel right now,

06:33.126 --> 06:34.728
they'll say they're booked.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.797
Oh, they absolutely will.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.099
They might not.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.568
I knew it.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.604
You know what?

06:43.637 --> 06:46.106
I can deal with
the napkins and the coffee,

06:46.139 --> 06:48.075
but you can't skimp
on the big stuff.

06:48.108 --> 06:51.745
The family stuff, that's what
makes me crazy, all right?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.781
I don't want to hear
about any more secret ways

06:53.814 --> 06:55.115
that you've been
cheaping out.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.486
Well, d-don't
worry, you won't.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.688
Okay, good.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.690
Hey, what did you want
to talk to me about?

07:02.723 --> 07:04.157
Nothing.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.896
Uh, well, I just wanted
to talk... in general.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.665
And we did.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.501
Great job.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.170
So I'm not telling her.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.808
I'm sorry it didn't go well,
but I'm thrilled to be back.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.010
I'm this close to
making us all T-shirts.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.978
What happened?
I didn't have time
to get the design right.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.647
Not you.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.181
What happened?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.851
Well, I was gonna tell her,
but inside of five minutes,

07:30.884 --> 07:34.722
she busted me on discount
chicken, reused coffee pods,

07:34.755 --> 07:36.857
and a secret budget hotel.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.660
It did not seem wise or healthy
for me to tell her

07:39.693 --> 07:41.862
I picked Pastor Carl
because he was cheaper.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.130
I mean, "frugaler."

07:43.163 --> 07:45.833
I once had a frugaler
at a Jewish wedding.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.935
It was delicious.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.804
So the problem isn't
that you're not married,

07:50.838 --> 07:53.574
it's that you're not married
because you were cheap.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.909
And she does not like that,
which is sad,

07:55.943 --> 07:58.211
because I think it's one
of my greatest qualities.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.246
Look,

07:59.279 --> 08:00.247
when it comes to money,

08:00.280 --> 08:01.782
I'm right and she's wrong,

08:01.815 --> 08:03.984
but this will prove
that I'm wrong.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.153
If it proves you're wrong,
doesn't that mean you're wrong?

08:07.020 --> 08:09.590
Clearly I'm wrong.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.759
It will upset the balance
of our whole marriage.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.927
I'll lose every
money argument forever.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.763
We'll just be sitting
in the poor house

08:15.796 --> 08:18.799
with our rich black coffee
and high-end napkins.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.601
So you're not gonna
tell her at all?

08:20.634 --> 08:21.802
You're just gonna
stay not married?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.771
I thought about that.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.939
I could tell her now, or...

08:25.973 --> 08:27.808
I could fix it
and tell her never.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.309
Huh? How about this?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.778
Andi's always talking about

08:30.811 --> 08:31.979
renewing our vows someday.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.781
Why can't that be now?

08:33.814 --> 08:36.316
And why can't that be done
by a real pastor?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.185
Then you'll be
legally married.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.953
I like it. It's got
Lowell's romance,

08:39.987 --> 08:41.555
it's got Dad's
outside the box,

08:41.589 --> 08:43.523
and it's kind
of shady, like me.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.902
What?

09:03.944 --> 09:07.881
You are so beautiful.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.917
Even when you're
about to spit.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.952
Mmm. Thanks, honey.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.024
You know, I was
just thinking,

09:17.057 --> 09:19.960
we haven't done something
really romantic in a long time.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.862
You know, to
celebrate our love.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.598
Aw, sweetie, you don't have
to do a whole song and dance.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.667
You know I'm always up
to roll around a little.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.302
We can do that,
too, but I'm talking

09:29.336 --> 09:31.905
about a spontaneous event.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.842
Like... (gasps)

09:39.847 --> 09:42.149
Ah, never mind,
it's too romantic.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.018
No. Whoa. What? What?
No, no, no.
It's too magical.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.854
(gasps)
Tell me.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.025
(sighs)

09:53.727 --> 09:55.996
What if we renewed our vows?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.397
(gasps)

09:57.430 --> 10:01.001
Oh, I've always
wanted to do that.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.870
Oh, but, I mean,
shouldn't we wait

10:02.903 --> 10:04.271
for a big anniversary?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.173
Like our 20th or our 30th?

10:06.206 --> 10:08.175
No, no, no. No, no, no.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.011
I-I-I, I think we
do it right now

10:11.044 --> 10:13.847
for our 17-and-a-half-ieth.

10:13.881 --> 10:14.948
Huh?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.984
No one will see that coming.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.852
What's gotten into you?

10:18.886 --> 10:21.088
Just a bunch of love.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.256
Huh? Think about it.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.292
The girls can wear
matching outfits.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.094
Teddy can wear suspenders.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.863
You love Teddy in suspenders.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.699
He looks so cute--

10:31.732 --> 10:33.433
like a tiny Southern lawyer.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.068
Yeah.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.305
Okay, let's do it.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.941
We're doing it.
(laughing):
Yeah. This is so exciting.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.044
(gasps)
Ooh. What about having
it in the Bahamas?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.278
Huh?
Uh... (chatters teeth)

10:45.312 --> 10:47.147
Oh.
Nah.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.949
Sharks. I forgot.
Mm-hmm.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.084
Yeah, but it's still
gonna be great.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.687
Yeah, yeah. Oh, and this
time, my dad won't be trying

10:53.721 --> 10:57.257
to talk me out of it as
I'm walking down the aisle.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.899
I did not know he did that.

11:05.933 --> 11:08.001
Huh. Look, but-- hey,
let's get married again.
Yay! (laughs)

11:15.075 --> 11:16.143
Okay, great,

11:16.176 --> 11:18.111
you guys are all set for
the renewal ceremony tonight.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.413
We look
like dweebs.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.150
Yes, you do. That's your wedding
present to your mother.

11:23.183 --> 11:27.687
These suspenders are pulling
my pants up too high.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.258
I feel like I'm
sitting on a rope.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.761
Go loosen 'em up a little.
I want grandkids.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.166
Okay, I'll take these
out to the backyard

11:39.199 --> 11:40.734
and arrange them
around the altar.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.269
Oh, and, Adam, I think

11:42.302 --> 11:44.437
what you're doing today
is incredibly romantic.

11:44.471 --> 11:48.008
(laughs)
That's a hint, Don.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.109
I'm all over it, baby.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.815
So in a few hours, you're
gonna make an honest woman

11:54.848 --> 11:56.249
out of Andi.
Yeah.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.951
She's very excited.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.153
Apparently, I'm the world's
greatest husband...

12:00.187 --> 12:02.856
based on her limited
information.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.058
But after tonight
we'll be back to being married,

12:05.092 --> 12:07.327
and I can pretend
this whole thing never happened.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.162
You seem
a little jumpy, son.

12:09.196 --> 12:12.232
I saw that look run past me
in Vietnam a lot.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.467
Yeah, I'm jumpy. I got

12:14.501 --> 12:17.137
a lot of balls in the air, a lot
of stories. It's complicated.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.239
Hey, listen, if you were
gonna tell her the truth,

12:19.272 --> 12:21.241
you should have done it
the day you found out.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.243
The cover-up is always worse
than the crime.

12:23.276 --> 12:28.181
Why didn't you say that when
we were having the war council?

12:28.215 --> 12:31.084
I just thought of it.
Oh.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.519
Don't give me
a bunch of beers

12:32.552 --> 12:35.022
and then ask me
serious questions.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.124
Well, you know what? Andi
will be home any minute

12:37.157 --> 12:39.059
from getting her hair done,
she'll see how beautiful

12:39.092 --> 12:40.327
everything looks out there,

12:40.360 --> 12:42.395
we'll tie the knot,
and I'll be home free.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.165
All right, I'm gonna
go get your mom.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.566
She's been up on blocks

12:46.599 --> 12:48.501
at the beauty shop
getting a full refurb.

12:48.535 --> 12:52.039
(knocking)
Oh, that'll be Lowell
with cake. Okay.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.207
Yeah.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.243
Who are you?
Pastor Carl.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.011
Son of a bitch.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.149
Pastor Carl, what
are you doing here?

13:02.182 --> 13:04.317
(scoffs)
I need to talk to Andi.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.519
Turns out, I got
to make amends to her, too.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.221
I got a meeting
in a few hours,

13:08.255 --> 13:10.223
and if I get Andi,
I can move on to step ten.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.325
Well, settle in to step
nine 'cause you're
not talking to her.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.526
You got to get out of here.
No, no.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.997
I'm not going anywhere
until I see Andi.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.232
Okay, uh, fine. Um...

13:19.266 --> 13:21.201
Tell me what you want to say
to her, and I'll text it to her.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.370
Then you can leave,
and I'll text you what she says.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.072
She'll probably say
something like, "I forgive you.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.374
Don't ever come to my house
again, and, you know..."

13:27.407 --> 13:29.242
No. Don't sit!

13:29.276 --> 13:31.311
I got bad knees from
standing at the craps table.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.316
Okay, fine. You know what?
I'll go get her.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.351
She's out in the driveway.
Yeah. Hey, is this champagne
for anybody?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.154
Yeah, anybody but you.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.455
So I just need you
to pretend

13:42.489 --> 13:44.357
to be my wife for,
like, five minutes.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.459
You have got to be kidding me.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.228
Do it for Andi, huh?

13:48.261 --> 13:49.629
How you would feel
if you found out

13:49.662 --> 13:51.364
you weren't really
married to Don?

13:51.398 --> 13:54.334
Yeah, that's not gonna
get you there.
Yeah, okay, okay,

13:54.367 --> 13:56.403
bad example. Look,
but I'm in a real spot here.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.505
This is my home.
I'd like to keep living here.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.173
Well, I don't know.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.076
Maybe I'll like
Andi's second husband better.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.611
Yeah, maybe he'll want
to play tennis with me.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.314
Oh.
Well, think about
Andi's feelings, okay?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.382
She loved our wedding.
It meant everything to her.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.919
If you could help me fix this
without her finding out,

14:11.952 --> 14:13.586
it would really spare her
a lot of heartache.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.423
Okay, I'll do it...
for Andi.
Okay.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.657
But I have one condition.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.960
Anything.
I'm taking voice lessons,

14:19.993 --> 14:21.661
and you're gonna let me sing
at the renewal ceremony.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.596
Whatever you want. Yeah.
How long you been taking

14:23.630 --> 14:25.165
voice lessons?
My first one is Tuesday.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.334
Oh.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.569
Okay.

14:29.602 --> 14:33.340
Here's my wife Andi, so you can
make your amends and move on.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.308
You looked a lot different
at the wedding.

14:35.342 --> 14:38.311
(mutters)
Well, you know, living
with me takes it toll.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.147
I'm not buying this.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.182
If that's really Andi, kiss her.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.385
Whoa. Hey, Padre,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.354
If you're looking for a
thrill, go to the library,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.456
get on their Wi-Fi,
like the rest of us.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.326
Don.
You're not
kissing my wife.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.464
Okay, fine.
She's not my wife.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.665
But you got to
get out of here.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.300
My real wife will
be here any minute.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.701
I'll tell you what-- I'll
give you a hundred dollars

15:01.734 --> 15:03.303
to just go back
to being a gambler.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.637
Remember how fun
that was, huh?

15:06.974 --> 15:09.276
Hey... honey.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.111
Oh, my God.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.412
Pastor Carl?
DON:
All right.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.215
Let's back it up.
This is gonna get bumpy.
Mm-hmm.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.950
I can't believe this.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.718
You got Pastor Carl
to do the renewal

15:18.751 --> 15:20.420
because he married us
the first time?

15:20.453 --> 15:22.155
You are

15:22.189 --> 15:23.957
full of surprises.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.126
(laughing):
I sure am, yeah.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.328
But, unfortunately,
Pastor Carl can't do it

15:28.361 --> 15:30.097
'cause he's,
uh... he's booked.

15:30.130 --> 15:34.101
Yeah, he just came by to give
us the bad news in person.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.169
Oh, that's such a shame.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.471
You know what?
I'll do it.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.073
I'll cancel
everything.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.474
You will?
Yeah.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.443
I just love making people happy!

15:43.476 --> 15:45.312
Yay!
Yay!

15:45.345 --> 15:47.147
ADAM:
Hey!

15:47.180 --> 15:50.017
But you said you didn't
have your license anymore.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.618
Well, who cares?
It's just a renewal.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.253
Yeah, let's get happy.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.754
ANDI: Yes!
ADAM: No! No! No! No!

15:54.787 --> 15:56.723
Andi, Pastor Carl can't do it.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.558
Well, why not?
He just said he could.
Yeah.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.460
But he isn't a
licensed pastor.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.496
And-and-and...

16:03.530 --> 16:07.434
And he wasn't when he
married us the first time.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.472
What?

16:12.505 --> 16:14.674
Oh. Uh, what does that mean?

16:14.707 --> 16:17.410
Okay, technically--
and this is really

16:17.444 --> 16:20.513
just a small clerical thing--

16:20.547 --> 16:23.216
we're not legally married.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.587
Amends made.
Good night.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.490
(door closes)

16:30.523 --> 16:33.526
Oh, my God, so that's why...

16:33.560 --> 16:35.562
She's putting
it together.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.697
Wait. What?!

16:37.730 --> 16:39.266
Nope. She lost it.
Oh.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.401
I-I'll walk her through it.
Oh.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.271
The renewal wasn't a renewal.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.539
He was trying to marry you
without you knowing

16:46.573 --> 16:48.608
because that guy
wasn't pasteurized.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.514
Okay, she's all caught up.
Back to you.

16:56.449 --> 17:00.253
But the good news is we're all
set to fix this today, okay?

17:00.287 --> 17:02.122
I got a real pastor coming over.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.691
I checked his papers and
everything, so what do you say?

17:04.724 --> 17:06.526
Let's get hitched.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.395
I don't think so.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.063
(to "Here Comes the Bride"):
* Da, da-da, da

17:10.097 --> 17:12.499
* Da, da...

17:12.532 --> 17:14.501
Oh, Adam.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.475
You're so beautiful.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.447
Remember when
that was fun?

17:27.480 --> 17:30.150
You know what?
It's all coming back to me now.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.619
I gave you the pastor
to hire for our wedding.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.787
Where did Pastor Carl
even come from?

17:34.821 --> 17:37.090
I mean, why didn't you just
hire my guy?

17:37.124 --> 17:39.626
My actual minister guy,
my not-addicted-to-gambling guy?

17:39.659 --> 17:42.195
I didn't know he was
addicted to gambling.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.663
I was just trying
to save a few bucks.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.199
Your guy was so expensive.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.803
I'm sorry.

17:50.837 --> 17:54.874
We're not married
because you're cheap?

17:54.907 --> 17:59.846
You know, some people say
that's one of my best qualities.

18:01.848 --> 18:06.253
You know, I can deal
with a discount chicken, okay?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.721
But this? I mean, come on, Adam,
we're not really married.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.624
I just know that there's always
a storm coming.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.626
I think the storm is here.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.828
I'm just saying,

18:15.862 --> 18:19.299
we have been through some times.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.635
You remember 2008? I didn't
build a house for ten months.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.338
We almost had
to move in with my parents.

18:25.372 --> 18:26.806
They had one bathroom, Andi.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.809
One bathroom, no fan,
just a book of matches.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.644
But we had

18:31.678 --> 18:34.514
our rainy day fund,
so we got to stay here.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.484
Okay, I get it.

18:37.517 --> 18:41.621
But our wedding, Adam?
You skimped on our wedding.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.924
I skimped on our wedding because
I cared about our marriage.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.694
Which doesn't
legally exist.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.629
I am working on that.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.265
I almost had it today.
I was this close!

19:01.208 --> 19:03.343
(clears throat)

19:03.376 --> 19:06.846
Look, when we were
first engaged,

19:06.879 --> 19:09.582
I didn't know
if the business was gonna work.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.451
I was freaking out.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.554
Well, why didn't
you just tell me that?

19:14.587 --> 19:16.656
Because I didn't
want you to worry.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.426
Andi, I wanted
to give you everything,

19:19.459 --> 19:22.595
but I didn't have... anything.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.565
All I had was you.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.567
(sighs)

19:27.600 --> 19:29.802
Well, now look
what you did.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.272
You gave me the feels.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.876
You know, if you marry me again,

19:36.909 --> 19:39.979
I promise that every time
I make coffee...

19:40.012 --> 19:41.748
You'll only use the
coffee pod once?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.516
No, I can't do that.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.620
But I will always
give you the first cup.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.759
I'll take it.
(laughs)

19:52.792 --> 19:54.594
Let's get married again
for the first time.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.696
Great! Yeah.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.665
I get another crack
at our wedding night.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.632
I know what you like now.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.977
Thanks for marrying me
today, Mrs. Burns.

20:11.010 --> 20:15.248
Turns out that was a real quick
fix down at the courthouse.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.749
Mm-hmm.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.485
If I just told you
in the beginning,

20:18.518 --> 20:20.920
I could have avoided
a lot of trouble.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.889
Well, you're right
about one thing.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.425
Our first wedding night
was pretty wild.

20:25.458 --> 20:29.262
Mm-hmm.
But... this one's
even better.

20:30.863 --> 20:34.000
Yeah, I see what you're going
for there, but no.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.602
(laughs)

20:35.635 --> 20:37.770
Well, you're a good man.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.039
It's not easy to find
a guy to marry you

20:40.072 --> 20:43.443
when you're in your 40s
and you got three kids.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.647
Whose feet stink?
