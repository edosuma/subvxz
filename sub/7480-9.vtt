00:01.002 --> 00:03.567
Previously on
<i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i>

00:03.569 --> 00:06.255
Meet CIA Operations
Officer Michael Saleh.

00:06.323 --> 00:07.487
<i>Michael and I</i>
<i>have been working undercover</i>

00:07.554 --> 00:10.081
<i>in Sudan on the CIA task force.</i>

00:10.149 --> 00:12.080
<i>How long does he have left?</i>

00:12.148 --> 00:14.144
NELL: <i>Depends on how much uranium</i>
<i>he's ingested.</i>

00:14.212 --> 00:15.277
He's returned to Sudan

00:15.345 --> 00:17.648
to continue his
work with the CIA.

00:17.716 --> 00:19.553
Then I'm going there,
too, Hetty.

00:32.558 --> 00:36.198
We know that you are an American
undercover agent.

00:36.266 --> 00:38.701
We know this as sure as
the sky is blue above

00:38.768 --> 00:40.270
and the earth
under our feet.

00:40.338 --> 00:41.703
I'm not...

00:41.771 --> 00:44.538
So now, you
tell me...

00:46.306 --> 00:48.772
is there anyone else
undercover here

00:48.840 --> 00:50.373
working with you?

00:52.044 --> 00:53.945
(flame whooshing)

00:54.012 --> 00:58.083
Just tell us, and this agony
will soon be over.

01:03.923 --> 01:05.757
He's unconscious again.

01:07.861 --> 01:09.529
Kill him.

01:11.465 --> 01:12.698
Wait.

01:12.766 --> 01:14.433
It's too dark
in here.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.435
Put the lights
on him.

01:21.309 --> 01:22.976
Oh, yes.

01:23.043 --> 01:24.310
Much better.

01:24.378 --> 01:25.745
Very good.

01:25.813 --> 01:27.647
Looks like a
Tarantino movie, huh?

01:27.714 --> 01:30.249
(laughter)

01:30.317 --> 01:33.184
Governor Khaled will
be very pleased.

01:33.252 --> 01:35.953

01:56.802 --> 01:59.882
Six days ago, Sam returned
to work with the CIA task force

01:59.884 --> 02:02.219
looking into the presence
of al-Qaeda in Sudan.

02:02.287 --> 02:03.888
Focus of his investigation

02:03.955 --> 02:06.590
was Sudanese ex-Governor
Tahir Khaled.

02:06.692 --> 02:08.324
It's believed
Khaled has been

02:08.393 --> 02:10.693
harboring al-Qaeda
operatives.

02:10.762 --> 02:12.230
Did the CIA request
our involvement?

02:12.297 --> 02:13.564
HETTY:
Two days ago,

02:13.631 --> 02:16.000
the CIA lost touch
with Agent Hanna

02:16.068 --> 02:18.970
and two of its own
agents in the region.

02:19.038 --> 02:22.507
CALLEN: Both CIA agents have now
been confirmed dead.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.876
They were tortured
before they were killed.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.978
And there is a third body.

02:27.046 --> 02:28.713
Nell, please read

02:28.781 --> 02:31.281
the CIA report
verbatim.

02:33.751 --> 02:37.553
At approximately 1730,
the remains of a black male,

02:37.621 --> 02:39.588
approximately
40 years of age,

02:39.656 --> 02:41.156
were found in a field

02:41.224 --> 02:43.692
20 kilometers
outside of Khartoum.

02:43.759 --> 02:45.093
The body
was badly burned,

02:45.161 --> 02:47.094
preventing immediate
identification.

02:47.162 --> 02:48.862
HETTY:
The body is a match

02:48.930 --> 02:52.066
for Sam in height and weight.

02:52.134 --> 02:53.367
What was Sam's cover?

02:53.435 --> 02:55.169
He was working part-time
for the ex-governor

02:55.237 --> 02:57.138
as a civilian
security consultant.

02:57.205 --> 02:59.374
For the past year,
every few weeks,

02:59.441 --> 03:02.377
he would fly in
and review security procedures,

03:02.444 --> 03:04.012
run background checks.

03:04.079 --> 03:05.713
Travel arrangements
to Khartoum are confirmed.

03:05.781 --> 03:07.182
They're ready when you are.

03:08.584 --> 03:10.017
Mr. Callen.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.188
It appears that
Agent Saleh is right.

03:14.256 --> 03:18.058
There is a leak
in the CIA's chain of command.

03:18.126 --> 03:20.126
I understand.

03:22.329 --> 03:24.964
Find that leak.

03:47.788 --> 03:49.789
(men speaking local language)

04:19.452 --> 04:21.454
(sighs)

04:26.227 --> 04:27.761
(phone rings)

04:27.828 --> 04:29.696
I'm sitting down.

04:29.764 --> 04:31.498
Bullet hole in Sam's calf?

04:31.566 --> 04:32.832
Nasty scar.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.233
I dug that bullet out myself.

04:34.301 --> 04:36.435
There's no sign of it
on the body.

04:36.503 --> 04:37.736
Thank God.

04:39.538 --> 04:41.540
(rapid clicking)

04:43.609 --> 04:45.877
It's Michael Saleh.

04:45.945 --> 04:47.779
He knew this might happen.

04:47.847 --> 04:50.014
Sam and Saleh
were on the same task force.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.650
In all likelihood, Sam's cover
has been blown as well.

04:52.718 --> 04:55.920
Let's hope you're wrong,
Mr. Callen.

05:07.633 --> 05:09.500
Khaled's got his whole circus.

05:09.568 --> 05:11.302
If Sam's been betrayed
like the others,

05:11.370 --> 05:12.837
he could have escaped.

05:12.905 --> 05:14.806
No, he would have tried
to contact us.

05:14.874 --> 05:16.674
And if he couldn't?

05:16.742 --> 05:18.509
He'd either in hiding
or he's on the run.

05:18.577 --> 05:22.046
If he's on the run, then we're
looking in the wrong place.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.916
Do we know who the tall guy
next to Khaled is?

05:24.984 --> 05:26.317
Yeah. His first name is Kadeen.

05:26.385 --> 05:28.086
He's one of
Khaled's enforcers.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.223
Oh, who's she, the wife?

05:32.291 --> 05:33.858
HETTY:
That's Khaled's sister.

05:33.926 --> 05:35.327
Her name is Jada.

05:35.394 --> 05:37.796
She's been Agent Hanna's
primary target

05:37.863 --> 05:40.031
to gather information.

05:40.099 --> 05:43.067
He has, uh, shall we say,
cultivated

05:43.135 --> 05:46.537
a great trust with her
over the past year.

05:46.605 --> 05:48.039
She may know
what happened to him.

05:48.107 --> 05:50.909
I'm going to stay with her.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.545
I may have just been made.

06:17.868 --> 06:19.735
(Callen grunts, woman gasps)

06:31.548 --> 06:33.683
(grunts)

06:40.291 --> 06:41.725
My name is Elmslie.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.126
May I?

06:50.168 --> 06:51.368
Global Criminal
Tribunal?

06:51.436 --> 06:53.337
From the Hague.
I'm an investigator.

06:53.405 --> 06:56.607
I work on the prosecution
of crimes against humanity--

06:56.675 --> 06:59.410
atrocities, genocide, torture.

06:59.477 --> 07:00.544
Why were you running?

07:00.612 --> 07:02.313
Khaled's begun hiring
American security.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.014
I-I thought that's
who you could be.

07:04.082 --> 07:05.382
How do you know I'm not?

07:05.450 --> 07:07.484
I'm still breathing.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.721
My guess is
CIA, NSA, DoD?

07:11.757 --> 07:13.324
I need you
to come with me.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.126
Let's go.

07:25.105 --> 07:26.706
(line ringing)

07:26.774 --> 07:29.876
I need to confirm the
identity of an Alex Elmslie.

07:29.944 --> 07:31.443
We'll authenticate.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.248
The Global Criminal Tribunal
is trying to indict

07:36.316 --> 07:38.250
ex-Governor Khaled
for crimes against humanity.

07:39.318 --> 07:41.152
We've been
surveilling him,

07:41.220 --> 07:43.521
trying to get witnesses
to testify to his atrocities.

07:43.589 --> 07:46.357
He's massacred
entire villages.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.392
Innocent Southern
Sudanese murdered.

07:50.963 --> 07:52.931
You're here looking
for dead undercover agents.

07:55.167 --> 07:56.801
What do you know about that?

07:56.869 --> 07:58.169
I know that they're all dead.

07:58.237 --> 08:00.806
You're looking
for three bodies.

08:00.874 --> 08:02.107
I'm looking for 1,000.

08:03.143 --> 08:04.677
NELL:
Alex Elmslie checks out.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.446
Looks like he's one
of the good guys.

08:06.514 --> 08:08.782
He's helped convict
a dozen criminals

08:08.850 --> 08:10.951
in the Global Criminal Tribunal.

08:12.387 --> 08:13.787
Okay.

08:22.663 --> 08:24.631
ELMSLIE: Why are you watching
Khaled's sister?

08:24.698 --> 08:27.501
She has no connection to any
of her brother's businesses.

08:27.568 --> 08:29.569
Let's help each other.

08:29.637 --> 08:32.706
I know more about Khaled
than any man on Earth.

08:36.645 --> 08:37.745
I got eyes on Sam.

08:37.813 --> 08:40.548
Thank you, Mr. Callen.

08:41.851 --> 08:43.351
(sighs)

08:48.492 --> 08:50.827
He's working for you?

08:59.568 --> 09:01.436
Khaled's sister
is Khaled's property.

09:03.305 --> 09:06.307
To take the fruit
without permission...

09:06.374 --> 09:09.276
Khaled has burned men alive
for less.

09:28.476 --> 09:30.089
We can't do this.

09:30.090 --> 09:32.024
Came here to talk.

09:32.092 --> 09:33.360
Really?

09:33.427 --> 09:35.362
Be honest with
yourself.

09:35.429 --> 09:38.365
You invite a woman
to a hotel room to talk?

09:38.432 --> 09:42.469
After all these months
of secret e-mails,

09:42.537 --> 09:47.607
our hands touching
as we walk together.

09:48.743 --> 09:51.144
Then let me speak
with your brother,

09:51.212 --> 09:53.213
ask him for permission
to be with you.

09:53.281 --> 09:54.982
I advise him
on his security.

09:55.050 --> 09:56.950
He trusts me
with his life.

09:57.018 --> 09:59.486
He would never allow
a Westerner and a Christian

09:59.554 --> 10:01.755
to be anywhere near his sister.

10:01.823 --> 10:03.390
He'd sooner kill me.

10:03.458 --> 10:04.892
Let me just try.

10:08.029 --> 10:11.131
He has already promised me
to another man.

10:11.199 --> 10:12.766
Why didn't you tell me?

10:12.834 --> 10:15.369
And lose your attention?

10:15.437 --> 10:17.704
I'd rather die.

10:19.841 --> 10:21.274
Do you not
understand?

10:21.375 --> 10:22.609
My parents
are dead.

10:22.677 --> 10:26.946
My brother, he can do
with me what he wants.

10:27.014 --> 10:29.148
This is our way.

10:29.216 --> 10:31.084
So what do we do?

10:31.151 --> 10:35.789
If all we have is just this once
to be together,

10:35.856 --> 10:38.524
now, here...

10:40.928 --> 10:43.129
...then let us have it.

10:44.631 --> 10:46.865
Let us have it, Sam.

10:49.068 --> 10:51.336
So... what did you find?

10:51.403 --> 10:52.570
Well, it's not easy.

10:52.638 --> 10:55.473
With three agents dead,
the CIA is locked down tight.

10:55.541 --> 10:58.610
However, through a political
contact of mine in Washington,

10:58.678 --> 11:00.879
I was able to find the name
of the operations manager

11:00.947 --> 11:03.048
that was running the task force
that Sam and Saleh

11:03.115 --> 11:04.716
and the other two agents
were working on.

11:04.784 --> 11:06.752
His name is Colin Rand.

11:06.820 --> 11:08.354
Now, Rand's cover business is

11:08.421 --> 11:10.656
an African import company here
in Los Angeles.

11:10.724 --> 11:12.325
It allows him to move freely

11:12.392 --> 11:14.961
between the U.S. and Africa
without suspicion.

11:15.028 --> 11:18.198
Looks like Rand has accumulated
a pretty large personal debt.

11:18.266 --> 11:20.701
Okay, I got it.
My buddy in LAPD said

11:20.769 --> 11:22.804
that Colin Rand was busted
for buying cocaine

11:22.872 --> 11:23.972
from a dealer in
North Hollywood.

11:24.039 --> 11:24.973
The charges were dropped

11:25.040 --> 11:26.307
and he doesn't know why.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.577
Could be part of his cover

11:28.644 --> 11:32.379
or it could be the CIA stepped
in and had his charges dropped.

11:32.447 --> 11:34.415
No one would suspect
a junkie as a CIA agent.

11:34.482 --> 11:36.283
On the other hand,
needing cash to buy drugs is

11:36.351 --> 11:38.485
a good motive for selling the
names of agents in the field.

11:38.552 --> 11:40.186
Yes, it is.

11:40.254 --> 11:42.855
I'll call Rand,
set up a meeting.

11:42.923 --> 11:43.856
You talk to him.

11:43.924 --> 11:46.124
Find out anything you can.

11:46.192 --> 11:47.793
And if we think it's him,

11:47.860 --> 11:49.727
we just let the CIA do
their own inquiry?

11:49.795 --> 11:53.364
We'll make those decisions
at the appropriate time.

11:53.432 --> 11:57.436
But make no mistake,
Agent Blye,

11:57.503 --> 12:00.738
we'll protect our agents
at all costs.

12:10.416 --> 12:12.249
This isn't a one-way street.

12:12.317 --> 12:13.751
We have resources
and information

12:13.819 --> 12:16.186
that could help
your investigation.

12:16.254 --> 12:18.456
I wish I could help you,
I really do.

12:18.523 --> 12:20.991
The bodies of the dead
have never been found...

12:21.059 --> 12:23.928
from the massacres...

12:23.995 --> 12:26.831
Khaled has disposed
of them somehow.

12:26.899 --> 12:28.732
No bodies, no case.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.601
He's a mass murderer.
Look, I am here

12:30.669 --> 12:32.337
to determine
if my agent is safe.

12:32.404 --> 12:34.739
If I could just have
five minutes with your man...

12:34.807 --> 12:36.541
If I find out that he's safe,
and I pull him out,

12:36.608 --> 12:38.009
we're not even having
this conversation!

12:38.077 --> 12:40.712
And if he stays in, it is only
because the Sudanese al-Qaeda

12:40.779 --> 12:43.448
attempted an attack on
the U.S. last week.

12:43.515 --> 12:45.517
Thousands of Sudanese
have died here:

12:45.584 --> 12:47.719
women...

12:47.787 --> 12:49.854
children.

12:59.999 --> 13:02.000
I think my guy
may have just been made.

13:13.780 --> 13:17.083
JADA: Tahir,
we are just shopping.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.156
No... Kadeen, Kadeen, can just
drive me back later.

13:23.224 --> 13:25.926
Tahir...

13:25.994 --> 13:27.328
Fine.

13:27.395 --> 13:29.764
I will be back
at the car in ten minutes.

13:33.635 --> 13:34.802
I think he suspects
something.

13:34.870 --> 13:36.937
(crying)

13:37.005 --> 13:39.306
- No.
- Shh.

13:39.374 --> 13:40.373
(knocking on door)

13:44.378 --> 13:45.878
They have the wrong room.

13:45.946 --> 13:47.546
I'll take care of it.

14:01.563 --> 14:05.133
Do not open this door
for anyone.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.469
- Understand?
- Mm-hmm.

14:15.977 --> 14:17.845
Welcome to Sudan.

14:17.912 --> 14:18.845
We got company.

14:18.913 --> 14:20.013
I saw Kadeen out front.

14:20.081 --> 14:21.515
We've got
to get you out of here.

14:23.918 --> 14:25.418
It's too late.

14:41.002 --> 14:42.570
Friend of yours?

14:42.638 --> 14:45.139
- I should be, after that.
- He's good.

14:46.308 --> 14:47.342
Anybody else see?

14:47.410 --> 14:50.279
He did.

15:18.357 --> 15:19.286
CALLEN:
He got away.

15:19.287 --> 15:20.387
SAM:
That's not good.

15:20.454 --> 15:21.754
That's not good at all.

15:21.822 --> 15:23.255
You got some
people worried.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.223
Ever were thinking about picking
up the phone, maybe an e-mail...

15:25.291 --> 15:27.559
- Hi, Mom I'm okay.
- Yeah, something like that.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.995
Things got a little hot.
I couldn't take any chances.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.465
You know I still
love you, right?

15:32.533 --> 15:34.166
We have to get out of here.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.536
Help us with the body.

15:36.604 --> 15:38.538
Come on.

15:40.808 --> 15:42.075
I'm Alex Elmslie.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.110
I'm from the Global Criminal
Tribunal.

15:44.178 --> 15:46.552
You're here about
the massacres, right?

15:46.577 --> 15:48.001
Yes. Would you be
willing to help?

15:48.002 --> 15:49.144
Elmslie, we'd love
to help,

15:49.145 --> 15:51.213
but we're not even gonna be here
in a couple of hours.

15:51.281 --> 15:52.618
American interests disappear,
so do the Americans.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.586
That's an old song.

15:53.654 --> 15:54.887
Three agents are dead.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.022
That's why I'm staying in.

15:57.557 --> 15:58.724
There's a leak.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.693
If Khaled knew about me,
I'd be dead already.

16:00.761 --> 16:02.194
Doesn't mean
it's not gonna happen.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.696
I'm staying in, G.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.167
Got a plan for Kadeen?

16:08.234 --> 16:09.267
Yeah. You help us.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.202
Quid pro quo.

16:10.269 --> 16:11.503
Anything.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.039
I want to take your picture
and show it to Khaled.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.595
Mr. Rand is not gonna be able
to see you today.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.630
That's unacceptable.
This is an urgent situation.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.266
DEEKS: Here's what
you can do for me.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.635
You can call your boss back
and tell him we're not leaving.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.637
Actually, you can tell him
we're coming in right now.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.071
That's even better.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.774
(doorknob rattles)

16:48.842 --> 16:52.010
Open the door.

16:52.078 --> 16:55.113
Open the door
before I blow it open.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.948
RAND (over intercom):
It's okay. Let 'em in.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.488
(lock buzzes, clicks)

17:03.556 --> 17:05.690
Two minutes.
Close the door.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.959
Here's what I can tell you.

17:08.026 --> 17:11.295
Hanna was one of four agents
on a long-term mission

17:11.363 --> 17:12.796
to embed themselves
in the company

17:12.864 --> 17:14.765
of Governor Tahir Khaled.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.635
We knew Khaled monitored
al-Qaeda's operations in Sudan

17:18.703 --> 17:20.036
for the northern government.

17:20.104 --> 17:21.904
If we had access to Khaled,

17:21.972 --> 17:24.807
we'd have access to the entire
terrorist network.

17:24.874 --> 17:26.407
Okay, tell us something
we don't know.

17:26.476 --> 17:28.109
My regional director,
Neil Vernon,

17:28.176 --> 17:30.512
has instructed me
not to speak to anyone.

17:30.579 --> 17:33.215
There's really nothing else
I can tell you.

17:33.282 --> 17:34.950
You see this thing?
I love these things.

17:35.018 --> 17:36.784
These masks you have.

17:36.852 --> 17:38.520
I think they're
so interesting.

17:38.587 --> 17:40.254
'Cause we all wear them
at some point.

17:40.322 --> 17:42.423
Don't you think?

17:42.490 --> 17:45.893
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.361
And neither do you.

17:47.428 --> 17:48.996
Agent Hanna's not just
a coworker,

17:49.063 --> 17:50.664
he's a man who would die for us.

17:50.732 --> 17:52.833
And there's nothing we wouldn't
do to keep him safe.

17:52.901 --> 17:54.302
Are you threatening me?

17:54.369 --> 17:56.271
No, it's really quite
simple: All you have to do

17:56.338 --> 17:58.640
is tell us what you know
about the breach in security.

17:58.708 --> 18:00.075
What breach in security?

18:00.143 --> 18:03.279
We're not here
to play CIA spy games.

18:03.347 --> 18:04.714
Agent Hanna is a friend of ours.

18:04.781 --> 18:06.149
Friend?!

18:06.217 --> 18:08.584
I've lost three veteran agents
within a week.

18:08.652 --> 18:11.788
Good men that I have worked
with for years.

18:11.856 --> 18:13.856
Your regional director, what did
you say his name was?

18:13.924 --> 18:16.692
Was it Vernon? Is that right?
Vernon?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.326
He know about your embarrassing
little cocaine bust?

18:18.394 --> 18:20.095
KENSI: Or your financial
difficulties, for that matter?

18:20.162 --> 18:21.196
And all it takes

18:21.263 --> 18:23.398
is one phone call to Langley.
Langley?

18:23.466 --> 18:25.500
You don't get it, do you?

18:25.567 --> 18:29.937
Vernon is the only agent
besides me who had access

18:30.005 --> 18:32.841
to the names of the men
on my task force.

18:32.909 --> 18:35.977
Ever try investigating
your boss?

18:36.045 --> 18:37.246
So you're saying
it's Vernon.

18:37.313 --> 18:39.247
Vernon's the leak.

18:39.315 --> 18:41.583
Does Vernon have Sam's name?

18:41.651 --> 18:42.918
No.

18:42.986 --> 18:46.722
Sam was the only task force
agent not from the CIA.

18:46.823 --> 18:48.758
So Vernon doesn't know
about Sam?

18:48.826 --> 18:51.261
Which explains why
his cover's still intact.

18:51.328 --> 18:52.695
Not for long.

18:52.763 --> 18:55.632
Vernon knows that there was
one agent outside the family.

18:55.699 --> 18:59.168
He believes that agent
could be the leak.

18:59.236 --> 19:02.105
He's ordered me to give him
Sam's name before the day's out.

19:02.172 --> 19:03.606
So don't do it.

19:03.674 --> 19:05.142
Three agents are dead.

19:05.209 --> 19:06.910
My career is over.

19:06.978 --> 19:09.246
By tomorrow, there's
gonna be somebody else

19:09.314 --> 19:10.747
sitting in this chair.

19:10.815 --> 19:14.351
They'll have access to every
communication, every file...

19:14.419 --> 19:16.554
Vernon is gonna get
Sam's name

19:16.622 --> 19:19.324
one way or another.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.572
SAM:
Governor Khaled.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.473
What is so urgent?

19:35.541 --> 19:37.642
I was walking
near the marketplace

19:37.709 --> 19:39.076
and saw Kadeen sitting
in a car

19:39.144 --> 19:40.378
talking to a white man.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.613
When I went to approach him,
he tried to shoot me.

19:46.617 --> 19:50.054
I killed him.
The white man escaped.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.089
I don't know who he was.

19:54.826 --> 19:57.428
This white man,
I've seen him before.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.400
Many people are not pleased with
my affiliation with al-Qaeda.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.603
Could be CIA or American
military intelligence.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.373
He must have
turned Kadeen.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.184
Forget this.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.156
Have you thought
about coming

20:25.224 --> 20:26.590
to work for me full-time?

20:26.658 --> 20:28.659
I have.
I'm still thinking.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.295
Is it about money?
We could talk about that.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.564
It's a big change for me,

20:32.631 --> 20:33.998
living full-time here in Africa.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.534
I have other commitments.

20:35.601 --> 20:36.769
Family?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.304
No.

20:38.372 --> 20:39.806
Business.

20:39.873 --> 20:41.341
MAN:
Give me a hand.

20:45.380 --> 20:46.280
What are they doing?

20:46.348 --> 20:49.484
They're destroying any evidence

20:49.552 --> 20:51.486
of my government's
involvement with al-Qaeda.

20:57.093 --> 21:00.162
Don't you need to keep track of
al-Qaeda's presence here?

21:00.230 --> 21:01.630
We do.

21:01.698 --> 21:03.198
But after finding
three undercover agents,

21:03.266 --> 21:04.533
and this man,

21:04.601 --> 21:08.670
it's too dangerous.

21:24.923 --> 21:27.524
Stop the car.
I want to walk here.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.101
Kadeen suspected.

21:38.168 --> 21:40.036
I have to assume that
there are others, too.

21:40.104 --> 21:42.372
I only took the job
so I could be near you.

21:42.439 --> 21:43.707
It was a mistake.

21:43.774 --> 21:45.975
When I first came out here,

21:46.043 --> 21:49.045
I was only supposed
to be here two days.

21:49.113 --> 21:50.079
Then I saw you.

21:50.147 --> 21:52.749
You were cooking.

21:52.816 --> 21:53.950
(chuckles)

21:54.017 --> 21:57.420
You kept coming into the kitchen
for more food.

21:57.487 --> 22:00.823
I had never seen one man
eat so much.

22:00.891 --> 22:03.693
I came back halfway
around the world every month,

22:03.761 --> 22:05.228
just to be near you.

22:07.264 --> 22:09.900
The only thing worse than
not being with you

22:09.968 --> 22:11.768
would be to see you dead.

22:11.836 --> 22:14.137
You could come
to America with me.

22:14.205 --> 22:15.906
He would never allow that.

22:15.974 --> 22:17.441
We wouldn't tell him,
we'd just go.

22:17.509 --> 22:19.276
I could arrange a plane.

22:19.344 --> 22:22.446
He would hunt us both down
and have us killed.

22:22.514 --> 22:24.883
He's not that kind of man;
I know him.

22:24.950 --> 22:27.552
I do not think you do.

22:27.620 --> 22:29.420
For months,
you have defended him.

22:29.488 --> 22:30.822
You're believing the propaganda.

22:30.890 --> 22:32.690
Why are you so blind?

22:33.993 --> 22:35.427
In the name of patriotism,

22:35.494 --> 22:38.663
my brother has killed hundreds,
if not thousands, of men.

22:38.731 --> 22:40.532
Where's the evidence?

22:44.537 --> 22:47.004
That is why I brought you here.

22:47.072 --> 22:52.977
Perhaps now you will see how
dangerous it really is for you.

22:53.044 --> 22:55.313
Look behind you.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.720
(shutter clicks quietly)

23:05.622 --> 23:08.291
ERIC:
Sam sent this photo.

23:08.359 --> 23:10.226
Significance?

23:10.294 --> 23:14.164
It's a field ten kilometers
from Khaled's farm.

23:14.232 --> 23:16.833
Let's bring it up
on satellite.

23:20.338 --> 23:23.507
Let's bring up a view
from two years ago.

23:27.612 --> 23:28.979
The hill didn't exist
two years ago.

23:29.047 --> 23:31.281
It was a creek bed.

23:31.349 --> 23:32.650
It's not a hill.

23:32.717 --> 23:35.152
It's a mass grave.

23:48.169 --> 23:49.636
(soldier shouts in Arabic)

24:03.518 --> 24:05.786
American?

24:13.149 --> 24:14.983
(gun cocking)
It's okay.

24:15.051 --> 24:16.251
Just wait here.

24:18.221 --> 24:20.955
(speaking Arabic)

24:24.026 --> 24:27.595
ELMSLIE: Don't worry,
They work for me.

24:27.662 --> 24:29.730
They're Southern Sudanese.

24:29.798 --> 24:32.499
They've all lost families
in the massacres.

24:32.567 --> 24:35.202
Thank you for what
you are doing.

24:35.269 --> 24:36.270
I haven't done anything.

24:36.337 --> 24:38.138
SAM: Khaled burned
all documents

24:38.206 --> 24:40.741
linking the Northern Sudanese
government to al-Qaeda.

24:42.344 --> 24:43.778
Mission over.

24:43.846 --> 24:45.179
You're pulling out?

24:45.247 --> 24:46.448
You have the mass graves.

24:46.516 --> 24:48.483
I think you can handle
it from here.

24:48.551 --> 24:49.718
I may be when we exhume
those graves,

24:49.786 --> 24:52.021
nothing links Khaled
to the bodies.

24:52.088 --> 24:53.856
I understand that,
and I'm sorry,

24:53.924 --> 24:58.060
but this is not a matter for NCIS.
We need a smoking gun.

24:58.128 --> 24:59.528
And we need to find out

24:59.596 --> 25:01.297
who leaked the identity
of our agents.

25:01.364 --> 25:03.732
Then I say we take you out
and we put someone else in.

25:03.799 --> 25:06.167
It'll take years before another
agent's in the position I'm in here.

25:06.235 --> 25:09.070
Which makes no difference
if you're dead.

25:09.137 --> 25:12.239
Look, from what I've seen
over the past year,

25:12.307 --> 25:14.775
his soldiers haven't taken any
actions that weren't videotaped.

25:14.842 --> 25:16.510
ELMSLIE: You think
there are tapes

25:16.577 --> 25:17.744
of the massacres?

25:17.812 --> 25:19.213
I'd bet money on it.

25:23.519 --> 25:25.854
(sighs)

25:32.997 --> 25:35.099
Tell me what you're looking for.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.568
Three of the worst massacres
occurred in the villages

25:37.636 --> 25:41.105
of Gafak, Shafas, and Karkedeh.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.307
You find video
of any one of those...

25:43.375 --> 25:45.209
and we've got him.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.777
Okay.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.582
Thank you.

25:53.284 --> 25:55.652
How are you going
to handle Jada?

25:55.720 --> 25:57.587
I'm going to protect her.

25:57.655 --> 25:59.089
I'm going to take her back

25:59.156 --> 26:01.057
to the United States.

26:01.125 --> 26:03.659
I need this.

26:11.267 --> 26:13.001
Thanks.

26:24.782 --> 26:26.316
(sighs)

26:26.384 --> 26:29.319
Rand's boss Neil Vernon
has had an outstanding career--

26:29.387 --> 26:30.721
no disciplinary action,

26:30.789 --> 26:33.090
nothing that says he would
sell field agents' names.

26:33.158 --> 26:35.459
I'm not convinced that
Rand is telling the truth.

26:35.526 --> 26:38.329
Okay, so one's a mess, one's
perfect-- who do we believe?

26:38.396 --> 26:40.163
I just got into
Rand's computer.

26:40.231 --> 26:42.165
Great. Okay, see if Rand
has anything about Sam.

26:42.233 --> 26:43.800
(typing)

26:43.868 --> 26:45.502
No.

26:45.570 --> 26:48.271
Check for a communication
to an I.P. address in Sudan.

26:52.109 --> 26:53.309
Nothing.

26:53.377 --> 26:56.112
Hmm, what about e-mails
that have been securely erased?

26:56.180 --> 26:57.380
Okay.

26:58.449 --> 27:00.450
All right, in the last month,

27:00.518 --> 27:02.420
there are six deleted
e-mails that are sent

27:02.487 --> 27:04.355
to the same
address in Sudan.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.157
These could be to his agents.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.492
Okay, there are some
encrypted files attached.

27:07.560 --> 27:08.626
Let me try
to open them.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.162
Nice. Who were they to?

27:12.198 --> 27:13.499
(sighs)

27:13.566 --> 27:15.768
I don't know who the recipient
is, but I could get

27:15.835 --> 27:17.803
into their computer, take a look
through their webcam.

27:17.871 --> 27:19.071
Do it.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.307
All right, is there
anything in the room

27:22.375 --> 27:24.509
to identify
whose computer this is?

27:24.576 --> 27:26.010
How about those photos
on the wall?

27:26.878 --> 27:28.245
That's Khaled.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.813
DEEKS: Then it's gotta be
Khaled's office.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.848
Rand had direct communication
with him.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.483
And here is what Rand sent him.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.055
Rand sent Khaled
the names of the agents.

27:39.122 --> 27:40.189
He's the leak.

27:40.257 --> 27:41.891
Let's go.

27:48.298 --> 27:52.068
I've been watching you
standing out here.

27:52.136 --> 27:54.303
I see your tears.

27:54.371 --> 27:56.138
Don't try to hide them.

27:56.206 --> 27:58.207
Tell me what is wrong.

28:01.745 --> 28:05.348
JADA: Just the moods of
a young woman, brother.

28:05.416 --> 28:08.217
My beautiful sister,

28:08.285 --> 28:11.954
I know you better than
any person on earth.

28:15.358 --> 28:17.493
You're lying to me.

28:17.561 --> 28:19.161
Is there something
I can do?

28:19.229 --> 28:21.030
Please...

28:21.098 --> 28:23.433
please, I do not want
to marry Samir.

28:26.471 --> 28:29.673
I am not having
that discussion again!

28:29.741 --> 28:34.846
I have decided, and it has been
negotiated with Samir's family!

28:34.913 --> 28:39.350
To not accept it is
to dishonor this family!

28:42.521 --> 28:44.589
I am sick of this talk.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.962
Come inside.

28:52.030 --> 28:54.031
Our guests are waiting.

28:59.204 --> 29:02.574
(sobbing softly)

29:08.948 --> 29:10.315
(sobbing)

29:10.383 --> 29:12.784
We could
leave tonight.

29:15.455 --> 29:18.690
He would follow us
to the ends of the world.

29:18.758 --> 29:22.827
He would have to kill me
to restore honor to our family.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.695
Then we need to
find something

29:24.763 --> 29:26.563
that either threatens your
brother or shames him,

29:26.631 --> 29:27.832
something that
we could take

29:27.899 --> 29:30.635
that would make him
afraid to come after us.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.807
The killing of
the Southern Sudanese.

29:35.874 --> 29:38.276
He videotaped them.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.679
He wouldn't want
the world to see those.

29:41.747 --> 29:44.982
If we had those videotapes,
he wouldn't follow us.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.483
Where are they?

29:49.354 --> 29:51.155
JADA: There are times that
I have hated my brother,

29:51.222 --> 29:54.091
but I could not
betray him like this.

29:54.158 --> 29:56.426
He is the only family
that I have.

29:56.494 --> 30:00.130
We wouldn't have to
turn the tapes over.

30:00.198 --> 30:01.932
Just us having them
would be enough

30:02.000 --> 30:03.501
to force him to
leave us alone.

30:03.569 --> 30:04.969
KHALED (in distance):
Jada, we're waiting!

30:05.037 --> 30:07.472
Listen, Jada.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.274
Maybe in a few years, we
can ask for his forgiveness

30:09.342 --> 30:10.476
and we can all be
together again.

30:10.544 --> 30:11.777
Shh.

30:11.845 --> 30:14.080
I'm sorry.

30:21.522 --> 30:24.190
Sam...

30:24.258 --> 30:28.193
in his office
is a large cabinet.

30:28.261 --> 30:30.362
It's a carved wooden box.

30:30.430 --> 30:31.930
They are in there.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.037
I love you.

30:39.105 --> 30:41.240
I love you, too.

30:59.461 --> 31:01.462
(door opens)

31:03.966 --> 31:05.133
(door closes)

31:05.200 --> 31:07.201
This way.
This way.

31:16.978 --> 31:18.846
Here we go.

31:23.085 --> 31:24.586
Rand's dead.

31:24.654 --> 31:25.721
Gunshot wounds.

31:25.788 --> 31:27.456
Are you sure
he's dead?

31:27.524 --> 31:28.958
Eric, I'm looking
right at the body.

31:29.025 --> 31:30.026
Well, that's
really weird.

31:30.093 --> 31:31.294
Why?

31:31.361 --> 31:33.063
Because there's another e-mail
being composed

31:33.131 --> 31:35.032
right this second from Rand

31:35.099 --> 31:36.967
to Khaled's compound.

31:37.035 --> 31:38.602
There's an encrypted attachment.

31:38.670 --> 31:40.704
Can you stop this
transmission?

31:40.772 --> 31:41.538
We're working on it.

31:41.606 --> 31:42.773
Get that attachment open,

31:42.840 --> 31:43.807
Mr. Beale.

31:43.875 --> 31:45.443
Deeks, Kensi, somebody is

31:45.510 --> 31:47.311
e-mailing Sudan
from Rand's computer.

31:47.379 --> 31:48.379
Eric.

31:48.446 --> 31:49.613
Got it. Here's
the attachment.

31:51.450 --> 31:53.384
Crash that network now.

31:53.452 --> 31:56.053
Whatever you have to do,
bring it down.

31:56.121 --> 31:58.657
Do not let that
e-mail get sent.

31:58.724 --> 32:01.493
It's part of the CIA's network;
it's not going to be easy.

32:01.561 --> 32:03.262
HETTY:
Deeks, Kensi, you have to get

32:03.330 --> 32:05.331
to Rand's computer now!

32:06.867 --> 32:08.468
Okay, I-I can't
do it that fast.

32:08.536 --> 32:10.137
I can't crash the
network in time.

32:10.205 --> 32:11.138
Agent Blye.

32:11.206 --> 32:12.973
Almost there.

32:43.005 --> 32:45.240

Make a move to send that,
you're dead.

32:55.453 --> 32:56.853
DEEKS:
No, no.

32:56.921 --> 32:57.721
Don't move.

33:21.547 --> 33:23.681
The Southerners

33:23.749 --> 33:25.984
Without our help,

33:27.052 --> 33:28.552
Yes.

33:28.620 --> 33:30.587
There is someone here
to see you.

33:30.655 --> 33:32.189
Why are you interrupting me?

33:32.257 --> 33:33.390
Who is it?

33:35.593 --> 33:36.960
I don't know you.
I'm sorry.

33:37.028 --> 33:38.195

33:41.532 --> 33:44.668

34:08.793 --> 34:10.427
(snaps fingers)

34:11.797 --> 34:13.797
Talk.

34:16.368 --> 34:18.902
Good boy.

34:18.971 --> 34:21.505
Search him.

34:28.380 --> 34:29.947
Here.

34:31.985 --> 34:34.119
You're a spy.

34:35.154 --> 34:36.788
(guns cocking)

34:36.856 --> 34:42.060
Find out who he works for,
then kill him.

(snaps fingers)

35:12.844 --> 35:14.044
(muffled grunt)

35:14.111 --> 35:15.712
How much do
you love him?

35:15.780 --> 35:17.080
(grunts)

35:17.148 --> 35:18.482
Three simple questions:

35:18.549 --> 35:21.452
your real name, the
organization that you work for,

35:21.519 --> 35:23.521
and who else is here.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.027
Brave?

35:29.095 --> 35:31.730
I've seen many brave ones.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.398
But eventually,
they are no different

35:33.466 --> 35:35.133
than the cowards.

35:35.201 --> 35:40.137
They all beg to die,
and they all tell me the truth.

35:40.205 --> 35:44.575
So you go ahead... be brave.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.044
(door opens)

35:49.214 --> 35:51.448
What do you want?

35:52.483 --> 35:54.151
Leave us.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.688
Leave us!

36:00.725 --> 36:02.893
I want to ask him
one question.

36:07.432 --> 36:10.234
He said that he loved me.

36:12.637 --> 36:15.405
Were you using me?

36:20.110 --> 36:22.278
Were you using me?

36:24.247 --> 36:25.914
No.

36:30.453 --> 36:32.721
Was he trying to escape?

36:32.789 --> 36:34.423
Yes.

36:34.491 --> 36:37.360
We believe he's working
for American intelligence,

36:37.427 --> 36:39.229
maybe CIA.

36:47.405 --> 36:49.106
(muffled grunting)

36:50.275 --> 36:53.577
He said that he would
take me to America.

36:53.645 --> 36:57.281
MAN: He's not going
to America now.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.625
Home of the brave.

37:12.630 --> 37:13.963
We will see.

37:14.031 --> 37:15.132
Pull his shirt up.

37:15.199 --> 37:17.134
(gunshot)

37:23.507 --> 37:25.141

37:29.913 --> 37:31.013

Cut me loose.

37:31.081 --> 37:33.149

37:36.887 --> 37:38.889
Come on.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.961
G, I'm coming out.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.029
Go!

37:49.535 --> 37:52.170
Get her out of here.

38:06.016 --> 38:07.049
Come on, get in the car!

38:07.117 --> 38:08.951
- We got one more!
- Wait! Don't go!

38:09.019 --> 38:10.753

38:11.855 --> 38:13.522
ELMSLIE:
Callen, get in the car!

38:15.425 --> 38:16.792
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

38:16.859 --> 38:18.327

Go, go, go!

38:18.395 --> 38:19.194

38:51.261 --> 38:53.630
I'm sorry.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.368
What is going on?

39:00.973 --> 39:02.674
You're on American soil now.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.676
You'll be taken
into custody.

39:06.679 --> 39:08.947
You'll be asked to testify
against your brother,

39:09.015 --> 39:13.652
both for NCIS and the Global
Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.591
What are you talking about?

39:19.659 --> 39:21.993
In exchange...

39:27.131 --> 39:31.067
You'll be given asylum
for your cooperation.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.070
This will be
a new beginning for you.

39:33.137 --> 39:36.140
You could even eventually
get U.S. citizenship.

39:40.947 --> 39:45.585
But... you will be with me
as you promised?

39:49.324 --> 39:51.258
You'll never see me again.

39:51.326 --> 39:53.327
(gasps)

40:01.203 --> 40:04.505
I will never testify
against my brother.

40:04.573 --> 40:07.808
Then you'll be sent back
to your country.

40:07.876 --> 40:10.878
But if I go back there now,
I will be killed!

40:14.383 --> 40:17.486
Was any of it real?

40:17.554 --> 40:21.858
All that time, those e-mails,
you were holding my hands.

40:24.329 --> 40:26.664
You were holding my hands.
