02:29.066 --> 02:30.776
- Oliver!
- Yeah.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.694
Can you get me
the big cutters?

02:32.694 --> 02:34.363
You got it.
Thanks.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.467
Man 1: Accessing
underground structure.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.886
Man 2: Feeds are live.
Woman 1: Got it.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.346
We're in.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.014
Wait until the asset
gives the all clear.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.516
Man 3: Copy.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.643
Man 4: Take some pictures.
Man 3: Roger.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.187
Man 1: Getting imagery now.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.814
And of the nuclear facility.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.150
Man 4: Look at that, they
got the whole thing underground.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.943
Even the chimneys are hidden.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.333
Come on Oliver,
let's wrap it up.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.087
Show me what you did!

04:14.087 --> 04:15.172
Hey!

04:16.256 --> 04:18.717
Hey, I'm talking to you.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.719
Show me what you did!

04:20.719 --> 04:22.137
Hey, hey!

04:22.137 --> 04:26.349
We're almost done here.
Almost done!

04:26.349 --> 04:30.145
He needs to show us,
what he was doing.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.524
You've seen our paperwork.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.194
Which is working on
the telephone lines...

04:37.194 --> 04:38.069
The internet...

04:38.069 --> 04:41.406
better connectivity
for the city of Qom.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.701
He's a Spy.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.869
A pig!

04:45.869 --> 04:47.329
No, no, no!

04:48.413 --> 04:50.665
He's just quiet,
he doesn't talk much.

04:53.710 --> 04:57.422
We call Quds Force.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.927
We were hired by your Government.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.595
By the Ayatollah.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.764
Hey, hey!

05:08.517 --> 05:10.769
Woman 1: Scan all frequencies.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.270
Any charter back to Tehran?

05:12.270 --> 05:14.272
Man 1: Negative,
no radio transmissions.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.442
It's okay.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.027
Just my phone.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.198
Look.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.451
See?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.080
Come here.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.420
Look, see? Come here.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.297
Now you got fast internet.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.800
Ey?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.595
Still want to call Quds Force?

05:47.931 --> 05:50.267
Come here. Come here.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.019
Come here, watch.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.104
Football.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.817
See?

05:58.817 --> 06:00.569
Man on phone: It's a goal!

06:02.028 --> 06:03.572
Yeah.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.865
Man on phone: It's a goal!
Incredible...

06:20.922 --> 06:22.132
Man 1: They just pulled
away from the sight.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.592
Man 4: Keep eyes
in the sky on them.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.143
You think they're onto us?

06:33.143 --> 06:35.145
We're not hanging
from a crane yet.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.609
Don't worry, our cover's tight,
we're good.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.569
I'm ready for
this one to be over.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.657
Woman 1: Watching right up.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.784
Man 1: UAVs and
drones on standby.

06:49.784 --> 06:50.994
Man 4: Maneuver's a go.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.078
Execute.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.457
Man 3: Breaching firewall.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.876
Woman 1: System running at 95%.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.587
Man 2: Confirm the alarms
are disabled in centrifuge room.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.422
Man 1: Confirming,
alarms disabled.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.052
Man 2: Eyes on guard,
still no movement.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.429
Man 5: The Trojan horse is
active, and we are undetected.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.889
Man 2: Copy, no detection.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.223
We're in the mainframe now.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.892
How much time?

07:13.892 --> 07:17.228
Ten hours until it
hits the centrifuges.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.480
Twelve until meltdown.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.690
Man 2: Continue
monitoring the CCTV.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.858
Man 3: Copy.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.486
Three, two, one.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.030
I'm Luna Cujai, and this
is your Middle East update

07:27.030 --> 07:28.615
broadcasting live from Oman.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.076
Tensions continue
after Iran's decision

07:31.076 --> 07:34.329
to abandon nuclear negotiations
with Western powers.

07:34.329 --> 07:37.248
Still no boots on the
ground, as promised by the US.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.877
Three, two, one.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.380
Still no boots on the ground,
as promised by the US

07:43.380 --> 07:45.298
and its allies,
after their withdrawal

07:45.298 --> 07:47.759
of conventional
forces in Afghanistan.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.095
Yet the shadow war wages on.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.098
Elite American and British
units continue to hunt down

07:53.098 --> 07:55.809
high value targets
in denied territories.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.270
In the last month alone, the
assassinations of two Iranian

07:59.270 --> 08:02.065
nuclear scientists
and a top Al-Qaeda leader...

08:19.165 --> 08:22.085
James, James, what do I do now?

08:22.085 --> 08:23.878
James on phone: Okay,
I'm sending the file.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.588
Open the key to
encrypt the connection

08:25.588 --> 08:27.006
point to point, we gotta hurry.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.351
Oh, my God!

08:39.644 --> 08:42.105
This exposes
their entire operations.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.982
James on phone: And that's
why we got to be careful okay.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.693
But no names, you hear me?
Okay? Protect the assets.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.070
Yes, I promise, I promise,
just, just the companies,

08:49.070 --> 08:50.905
the CIA is using for cover, right?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.907
James on phone: I just want
them to know I'm a patriot

08:52.907 --> 08:54.117
that I'm protecting my country,
that's why I'm doing this.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.618
Yeah.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.911
Wait, someone's coming, I
gotta go.

08:56.911 --> 08:57.996
James?

09:03.042 --> 09:05.170
Der Herald Newspaper,
how may I assist your call?

09:05.170 --> 09:07.088
Hi, this is Luna Cujai.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.174
Please connect me
to Hans Forzburg's office.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.967
Uh, yeah, yeah, tell
him it's an emergency.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.346
Luna, what have you got?
- Hello, Hans?

09:15.346 --> 09:17.015
My Pentagon source
just came through.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.349
Can we
verify the information?

09:18.349 --> 09:21.227
Yeah. The CIA's Black Ops.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.479
Hans on phone:
Jesus, are you sure?

09:22.479 --> 09:24.147
Luna on phone: Yeah, trust me.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.983
It'll be bigger than Snowden
and WikiLeaks combined.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.568
Fantastic work, Luna.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.944
You're exposing the Hypocrisy

09:29.944 --> 09:31.863
and we're going
front page with it.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.194
I'll call Langley,
make sure we're on.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.654
We better be.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.989
Some maintenance guy checks

10:55.989 --> 10:58.074
that junction box, we're fucked.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.450
Hello?
Hey, it's me.

11:40.450 --> 11:43.411
Huh, every time you call,
it's from a different number.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.789
Listen, I get in late
tomorrow night to Gatwick.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.250
I'll call you if my flight's
delayed, alright?

11:49.250 --> 11:51.711
And make sure you're
on the plane this time, Tom.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.296
'Cause Ida's already
told her friends that her

11:53.296 --> 11:55.006
fucking dad will be there
for her graduation.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.008
Alright, don't start, Cory.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.802
I mean you know,
the job dictates everything.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.180
Well, you know what, you
need to dictate it this time

12:02.180 --> 12:03.973
or you're gonna break her heart.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.853
And... I-- I also need
you to sign the papers.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.440
And, I suppose I could
finally move on.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.820
Are you seeing somebody?

12:17.820 --> 12:18.947
Yeah, I am.

12:18.947 --> 12:22.241
Is this serious?

12:22.241 --> 12:24.619
I just want to stop
living in this purgatory.

12:24.619 --> 12:27.246
You know what I mean,
look at your things.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.123
They're all over the flat.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.084
I'll do whatever
you need, alright?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.211
I just...

12:33.211 --> 12:35.338
I want you to be happy.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.882
Sure you're gonna go right
back there after the graduation.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.677
You'll never quit.
- I--

12:40.677 --> 12:42.762
Admit it.
- What do you want from me?

12:42.762 --> 12:46.015
I mean, I don't have anything
else on my resume, do I?

12:46.015 --> 12:47.558
You know you can teach.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.769
Teach?
Yeah, teach.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.854
Y-- you've got the degree.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.690
I'm not really that interested

12:53.690 --> 12:55.650
in sitting behind
a desk all day.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.159
I'm sorry, Cory.
Okay.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.704
About everything.
Just...

13:07.704 --> 13:09.580
Just please
be safe, will you?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.043
And please be on that flight.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.128
Okay.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.363
Next.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.325
Passport?

13:54.792 --> 13:58.629
Place your fingers on there.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.265
What is your business in the
Islamic Emirate?

14:09.265 --> 14:12.351
I'm working with the
Red Crescent...

14:12.351 --> 14:14.270
Drought relief.

14:33.539 --> 14:37.960
Do not take pictures.
You are to obey Sharia law

15:11.035 --> 15:12.161
Yeah.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.458
Hello?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.377
It is good to hear your voice.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.672
Any problems
getting in the country?

15:22.672 --> 15:25.591
No, they bought the cover story.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.386
And my fingerprints weren't
in the system, like you said.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.887
You know I got you back.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.973
But still,
you got to be careful.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.975
If they find out
who you really are...

15:33.975 --> 15:36.060
I know the risk, Roman.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.645
Trust me.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.856
But I said I will
do this job, and I will.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.858
I know you would.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.193
That's why I got
that info you wanted.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.071
Nahal Hosseini.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.531
I'll text you her number.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.616
Thank you, thanks.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.326
When does
your friends come here?

15:52.326 --> 15:54.704
Day after tomorrow.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.040
Roman, it's just
a translating job, right?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.792
Just translating, yes.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.045
Okay, I got to go.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.586
Man 4: Status?

16:43.586 --> 16:45.755
Man 2: Centrifuges
are at temperature, sir.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.465
Woman 1: Distributing
variable spin speed.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.633
It's moving up now.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.635
Man 2: Increasing to 70,000 rpm.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.803
- Do they know we're in?
- No, sir.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.138
We're still clean.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.473
Do it.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.016
Man 1: Is everyone
at their stations?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.143
Man 2: Increasing
speeds to 90,000 rpm.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.773
Woman 1: Tracking pressure
increase in reactive space.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.527
Man 3: Temperature
continuing to rise.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.154
Now at 800 degrees.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.908
Woman 1: They manually triggered
their emergency alarms.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.413
Man 3: They triggered
the halon gas system.

18:21.183 --> 18:25.146
Luckily most of the radiation...
is trapped underground.

18:25.146 --> 18:28.774
The Supreme Leader
thinks we look weak.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.069
Especially after Natanz.

18:32.069 --> 18:35.948
He wants a public execution for
the person responsible.

18:35.948 --> 18:40.036
Only the Americans or
Israelis, have this capability-

18:40.036 --> 18:42.455
Yes, the problem is
proving it.

18:50.504 --> 18:54.133
We're monitoring a journalist...

18:54.133 --> 18:57.887
She received classified files,

18:57.887 --> 19:01.182
on all CIA operations
in the Middle East.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.813
Do whatever it
takes Farzad.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.024
And do it quick.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.354
Alright, I'm off to the airport.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.398
- Anything from Roman?
- All clean.

19:50.398 --> 19:53.275
Alright, make
sure... clean out the house.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.611
Wipe down all
the hard drives, ey?

19:55.611 --> 19:57.363
- Full burn down.
- You got it.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.492
Say hello to the
free world for me.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.412
Take care.

20:21.512 --> 20:26.350
The Northern Alliance conducted
raids in Sherberghan.

20:26.350 --> 20:30.104
They're massing a small force
outside of Kunduz.

20:30.104 --> 20:34.024
We need more ammunition for
the M4's and rockets -

20:34.024 --> 20:37.653
How the fuck can you be
running out of ammunition?

20:37.653 --> 20:39.447
When the Americans
left you with it?

20:39.447 --> 20:43.284
That was a long time ago, Kahil,
we're also fighting Daesh.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.662
New ISISK fighters coming in
from the Gulf every single day.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.707
I want to talk about the killings...

20:49.707 --> 20:51.459
in Herat, the teachers.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.878
Reeducating the population...

20:53.878 --> 20:56.088
...in the old ways.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.924
Set forth by
Mullah Omar-

20:58.924 --> 21:00.885
Mullah Omar is dead.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.012
Done gone, now what?

21:03.012 --> 21:05.473
I know they don't understand
a word I'm saying right now.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.225
But you better.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.769
Can't have you pull
this crazy shit all over again.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.316
Chopping heads off.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.195
Beating women in public.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.489
Taking selfies.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.073
The world is watching.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.993
And you have to show
them that you are modernizing.

21:25.993 --> 21:29.663
Because I can't have
my leaders face sanctions.

21:29.663 --> 21:32.791
But what you're worried
about is the dangers

21:32.791 --> 21:34.710
of little girls going to school.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.213
I'm not worried about
little girls in schools.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.255
Then what're you worried about?

21:38.255 --> 21:40.925
Traitors, Kahil, traitors.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.552
You continue
this revenge shit.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.264
There will be no
sanctuary for you

21:47.264 --> 21:50.392
or anyone of
you anywhere in Pakistan.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.603
Because the
Americans will come again.

21:52.603 --> 21:56.398
And they will bomb
the fuck out of you, again.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.067
So you'll be running
around in circles.

22:08.077 --> 22:12.164
You've been given a gift
from God.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.876
You've slayed...
the American dragon.

22:15.876 --> 22:20.548
Now you must focus on reuniting
your People.

22:20.548 --> 22:25.803
So the Caliphate... like a seed
in the wind can spread.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.930
Very good.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.272
Remember who put
you in that chair, Rasoul.

22:36.272 --> 22:39.400
Who made you, who protected you

22:39.400 --> 22:41.986
when you were being fucked hard.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.332
<i>Salaam Alaikum.</i>

22:55.332 --> 22:57.126
How did the meeting go?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.587
Sir, they've all gone mad.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.714
Times have changed...

23:01.714 --> 23:04.466
and these guys are still living
in the past.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.343
As long as they keep their backs
to India.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.515
Did you see the news?

23:11.515 --> 23:15.477
Someone burned
down Iran's crown jewel.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.189
Be ready...
your country may need you.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.608
Yes, sir.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.714
<i>Male reporter: As the United
States, Israel</i>

23:43.714 --> 23:46.050

23:46.050 --> 23:47.676
any involvement in the sabotage

23:47.676 --> 23:50.054
of Iran's nuclear
reactor today near Kam

23:50.054 --> 23:52.389
there are still no suspects.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.851
Many are reminded of Stuxnet,
the malicious computer virus

23:55.851 --> 23:58.896
that caused the centrifuge
meltdown of their tanks facility

23:58.896 --> 24:01.440
that incident followed
on for many other incidents...

24:56.286 --> 24:57.871
<i>Mr. Cujai: Are you still

24:57.871 --> 25:01.542
No, Mr. Hans wants

Mr. Cujai: Oh, wait, so
you're going to Berlin?

25:04.253 --> 25:06.547
Yeah, I have
to supervise the edit.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.257
Well, Lilly and I are
sure proud of you.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.134
Mr. Cujai: You did it.
- Oh, thanks, love.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.802

Mr. Cujai: Yeah, she's been...

Mr. Cujai: What's going on?

25:23.439 --> 25:24.940

of these at the embassy.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.873
Yeah.

33:01.688 --> 33:04.065
Two days ago, an American
named James Vincent

33:04.065 --> 33:07.319
sent you information about
my country's nuclear program.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.697
And now one of our nuclear
plants has been sabotaged.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.410

Siblixt locations...

33:23.293 --> 33:26.796

in the nuclear

33:26.796 --> 33:28.548

33:29.925 --> 33:32.802
Any names at Siblixt? Please.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.805
We didn't get any names. We
didn't-- we didn't get any...

33:35.805 --> 33:39.434
- No-- no names. We don't--
- Give me some names.

33:39.434 --> 33:42.062
I'm telling you the truth.
We didn't get any names.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.527
Please believe me.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.404
Wait. Please believe me.

33:51.404 --> 33:54.241
Please.
You said I could go home.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.744
You will.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.246
As a martyr.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.792

34:03.792 --> 34:06.503
You said, I could go
home. Please.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.171

34:50.171 --> 34:51.256
Okay.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.976
Package arrived for you yesterday.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.013
What is your mission?

35:42.098 --> 35:44.392
Go to Landing Strip near Taybad.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.771
Taybad. Taybad is in Iran.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.357
We leave at sundown.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.942
What do you mean we?

35:54.611 --> 35:56.863
What, Roman didn't tell you?

35:56.863 --> 35:59.407
No, he just said
I'm supposed to pick you up

35:59.407 --> 36:03.119
and be your translator,
but here in Herat.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.295
Alright, call him.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.765

37:08.518 --> 37:10.603
Nahal dear,

37:12.605 --> 37:14.691
It's so good to see you.

37:14.691 --> 37:18.319
How's your family?
How's my Adela?

37:18.319 --> 37:20.029
They are fine.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.574
We're living outside of Baltimore.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.325
Why are you here?

37:24.325 --> 37:25.994
The Taliban are still
searching for us.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.580
Adela's sister Fatemah
went missing.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.249
I promised Adela I'd find her.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.377
She was teaching in Herat.

37:34.377 --> 37:37.005
I don't know what happened
to Fatemah.

37:37.005 --> 37:40.467
I only know that the female
teachers disappeared.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.345
There was never going to be a
place for us

37:44.345 --> 37:47.515
with the Taliban.

37:47.515 --> 37:53.313
Not as Judges, Teachers,
Translators or Doctors.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.732
I'll send a word, if I
hear anything about Fatemah.

37:55.732 --> 37:58.610
Thank you.

38:01.237 --> 38:06.743
Come with me...
There's a flight out.

38:06.743 --> 38:09.621
I can't leave.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.665
Too much was gained.

38:12.665 --> 38:15.043
We lost our freedom.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.420
We can't do it again.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.505
I'm sorry.

38:47.825 --> 38:50.703
Hello my dear son.

39:00.672 --> 39:04.342
Dear son,

39:04.342 --> 39:08.972
you are always in our hearts.

39:12.767 --> 39:16.479
I miss you so much.

39:28.324 --> 39:31.411
I wish I had died
and you were alive.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.636
C-I-A...

39:50.638 --> 39:52.682
Breaking news
from Der Herald newspaper

39:52.682 --> 39:55.643
exposing the CIA's
illegal black operations

39:55.643 --> 39:56.853
in the Middle East.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.354
They include the
sabotage of Iran's

39:58.354 --> 40:00.815

nuclear reactor near Qom.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.109

by a Pentagon

classified documents...

40:05.111 --> 40:07.572
Come on now, hurry,
pick up the phone.

40:07.572 --> 40:08.615

40:08.615 --> 40:10.116

40:10.116 --> 40:13.411
in an Iranian prison
awaiting public execution.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.623
Der Herold's editor-in-chief
Hans Forsberg...

40:16.623 --> 40:21.252
...said he felt compelled to
make sure

40:21.252 --> 40:25.381
Cujai's efforts were not in vain.

40:25.381 --> 40:29.052
Hence, the
releasing of her report.

40:29.052 --> 40:31.387
Focuses on CIA operatives
who posed

40:31.387 --> 40:33.222
as telecommunication contractors

40:33.222 --> 40:34.891
for a Swiss company called, Siblixt

40:34.891 --> 40:37.268
causing the meltdown
of Iran's reactor.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.604
The fallout from this disclosure
could be devastating

40:39.604 --> 40:41.022
for Western interests.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.317
Yo.
Put the news on.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.027
Any channel.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.655
Does it have anything to do with
the guy watching the safehouse?

40:48.655 --> 40:50.823
There was a breach
at the Pentagon.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.158
We're exposed.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.661
How bad?

40:54.661 --> 40:56.663
They got your picture
and your alias

40:56.663 --> 40:58.373
but not your real name.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.920
Can't get in touch
with Oliver, Tommy.

41:23.106 --> 41:24.232
What's the play?

41:24.232 --> 41:25.400
Well, mission's aborted.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.068
Let me get you out of there.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.569
Hang tight.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.500
Get in quick.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.547
My scout got me this.

41:59.392 --> 42:00.518
We found where he is... Herat.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.690
Put together an action team.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.233
I want to deliver him to the
Supreme Leader...

42:07.233 --> 42:08.568
Before sundown.

42:08.568 --> 42:10.611
Yes sir.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.241
Get me on the phone to
Agent Nazir.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.884
I need you in Herat.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.635
What's so
special about Herat?

42:34.635 --> 42:40.266
The spy who sabotaged the Iranians.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.852
Sir, I was spending my two days
of holiday -

42:42.852 --> 42:45.396
Leave now.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.658
I want you to capture him,

42:57.658 --> 43:02.121
before the Iranians.

43:02.121 --> 43:05.291
We'll sell him on the
open market.

43:08.044 --> 43:10.171
Roman, I've got
Chris Hoyt here with me.

43:10.171 --> 43:12.256
Head of our
special operations group.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.884
The deputy director
asked him to sit in.

43:14.884 --> 43:16.552
- More the merrier.
- The field asset.

43:16.552 --> 43:18.721
- Tell me about him. Who is he?
- Tom Harris.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.390
A lifer. A loan to us from MI6.

43:21.390 --> 43:24.227
Total chameleon. He's one of my
go to low-vis guys.

43:24.227 --> 43:27.563
And he's running with
a former Afghan translator

43:27.563 --> 43:29.315
that we flew in to assist.

43:29.315 --> 43:30.525
Sounds like the life
of the party.

43:30.525 --> 43:32.485
Are the Iranians
their only problem?

43:32.485 --> 43:33.820
Are you joking?

43:33.820 --> 43:35.321
I mean, Afghanistan right now

43:35.321 --> 43:36.948
is like Cold War Berlin.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.826
Yeah, Talibs, Paks, Indians,
Russians, Chinese,

43:39.826 --> 43:42.453
and then you got ISISK

43:42.453 --> 43:44.539
too backwards for even Al-Qaeda.

43:44.539 --> 43:46.290
Any of them catch my guy

43:46.290 --> 43:48.543
will sell him
to the highest bidder.

43:48.543 --> 43:51.712
Unfortunately, we're gonna have
to cut them loose.

43:51.712 --> 43:54.799
- We have no other options.
- Yes, we do. Chris, come on.

43:54.799 --> 43:58.094
You know that 22 SAS
is in country right now.

43:58.094 --> 44:00.263
Hunting Al-Qaeda's
second in command.

44:01.514 --> 44:03.099
He's right.

44:03.099 --> 44:05.434
The Brits' flight out leaves
in 30 hours.

44:08.855 --> 44:12.567
Okay, I'll have
the deputy director call MI6.

44:12.567 --> 44:14.819
I'm sure they'll be happy
to get their man back.

44:17.697 --> 44:19.574
I'm doing the burn run now.

44:19.574 --> 44:21.701
I'm sorry, Tommy.

44:21.701 --> 44:23.536
This is your only shot
of getting out.

44:23.536 --> 44:26.497
That's alright.
I know what I signed up for.

44:26.497 --> 44:30.126
If anyone can make it, it's you.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.879
Extraction point...

44:32.879 --> 44:36.465
is an old CIA base
in Kandahar province

44:36.465 --> 44:38.301
using a C-130.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.969
Less than a minute
on the ground.

44:39.969 --> 44:42.305
How far from Kandahar
are they?

44:42.305 --> 44:43.806
About 400 miles.

44:43.806 --> 44:46.976
But the distance
is not the main issue.

44:46.976 --> 44:48.686
It's what's in between.

44:52.315 --> 44:54.859
Let's grab him quick
and get back home.

44:54.859 --> 44:56.777
The Taliban are looking for any excuse

44:56.777 --> 44:59.572
to blame us for their failures.

44:59.572 --> 45:02.909
Avoid civilian casualties
at all costs.

45:02.909 --> 45:04.535
Understand?

45:08.122 --> 45:09.248
Alright.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.545
What are you doing?

45:15.504 --> 45:16.964
Cover's blown.

45:16.964 --> 45:19.175
- Get your stuff.
- How?

45:19.175 --> 45:20.843
Doesn't matter how.

45:20.843 --> 45:23.346
We'll leave for Kandahar
in 15 minutes.

45:23.346 --> 45:26.432
Kandahar? We were supposed
to leave from here tomorrow.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.518
Not anymore.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.317
Come on. Let's go.

46:01.384 --> 46:03.052
The honorable Kahil.

46:03.052 --> 46:04.762
Slumming it with us again.

46:04.762 --> 46:09.058
Rasoul, I need a crew for snatch
and drive in Gandhar.

46:09.058 --> 46:10.768
Use your red units.

46:10.768 --> 46:13.187
Not those guys who are always
high on bugs spray.

46:13.187 --> 46:16.232
I know who you want...

46:16.232 --> 46:17.817
But the Iranians have already paid,

46:17.817 --> 46:20.861
to cross the border.

46:20.861 --> 46:23.072
He's their target now.

46:23.072 --> 46:27.326
I'll double whatever they
paid you.

46:27.326 --> 46:29.453
I don't want money.

46:29.453 --> 46:31.998
Make me the head of
the military council.

46:31.998 --> 46:33.666
My Pakistani brother.

46:33.666 --> 46:34.375
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.211
Just make sure
your fucking crew is ready.

47:18.210 --> 47:19.712
Man 1: They're out
of the safe house.

47:19.712 --> 47:21.088
Man 2: Keep your eyes peeled
for hostiles.

47:21.088 --> 47:22.339
Woman 1: Roger that.
Man 4: Start the clock.

47:22.339 --> 47:23.841
Man 3: We engage if they make
contact?

47:23.841 --> 47:26.135
No way. We're not working
under title 50.

47:26.135 --> 47:27.636
No, we can only advise.

47:27.636 --> 47:29.972
They wonder why we can't win.

47:37.188 --> 47:38.189
We're green.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.690
Go.

47:51.035 --> 47:52.745
Keep your eye out for a hoopty.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.789
- For what?
- It's a shitty car.

47:54.789 --> 47:57.249
We got to ditch this one.

47:57.249 --> 47:59.418
You know, maybe
we should have split up.

47:59.418 --> 48:01.295
I mean,
I can hide here for a few days

48:01.295 --> 48:03.297
and then take a flight
from Herat to Pakistan.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.132
Yeah, good idea, Mo.

48:05.132 --> 48:08.302
And get some rest before they
snatch you at Herat airport.

48:08.302 --> 48:10.012
That way, you'll last longer

48:10.012 --> 48:12.098
when they start pulling
your fingernails off.

48:16.060 --> 48:18.312
There's the market there.

48:18.312 --> 48:20.106
Okay, let's go this way.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.570
They're in the market.

48:44.713 --> 48:45.881
Where is he going?

48:45.881 --> 48:48.008
I see two SUV's
approaching the market.

48:53.264 --> 48:54.390
Here.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.895
Take the bags off the back.

48:59.895 --> 49:01.856
Wait for my signal, okay?

49:01.856 --> 49:02.940
Okay.

49:51.530 --> 49:52.656
Oy, oy, oy!

50:02.999 --> 50:04.376
They changed vehicles!

50:04.376 --> 50:06.253
Nissan truck.

50:07.630 --> 50:08.964
Don't lose him.

50:08.964 --> 50:10.799
Man 1: They're switching into a
white Nissan pickup.

50:10.799 --> 50:12.092
Woman 1: White Nissan.

50:12.092 --> 50:13.469
Man 3: Someone try to get the plates.

50:15.679 --> 50:18.224
Still can't find them.

50:19.475 --> 50:22.561
Search the entire city.

50:40.579 --> 50:41.705
Shit.

50:42.581 --> 50:44.083
Man 3: Coming to traffic.

50:44.083 --> 50:45.542
Man 2: There are two vehicles emerging.

50:45.542 --> 50:46.627
Ah.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.547
What's the way through this?

50:50.547 --> 50:52.841
The only way to Kandahar
is the highway one.

50:52.841 --> 50:54.760
It's on the other side
of the town.

51:02.601 --> 51:05.604
Stay here, in case he tries
to escape.

51:19.451 --> 51:21.495
We've got company,
black motorcycle.

51:28.210 --> 51:30.296
We see him.

51:33.966 --> 51:35.801
Tell him to get away
from the truck, Mo.

51:43.309 --> 51:46.020
Fuck!

51:46.020 --> 51:48.188
Fuck! Fuckin' clutch.

51:51.525 --> 51:54.862
Oh my God, you idiot!

51:55.863 --> 51:56.572
Sorry.

51:56.572 --> 51:57.197
What the hell?

51:57.197 --> 51:57.740
I am sorry.

51:57.740 --> 51:58.615
Look what you did to my car.

52:01.368 --> 52:03.495
May your house fall down.

52:07.750 --> 52:09.335
Sorry, here, one minute.

52:10.919 --> 52:13.172
Police!

52:16.008 --> 52:18.427
Yeah, here, here, here,
sorry, I'm sorry, okay.

52:40.866 --> 52:43.494
Hurry! Block him!
Block his way, hurry!

52:55.506 --> 52:58.133
Tom! Tom, go!

53:11.730 --> 53:12.981
Get out!

53:40.509 --> 53:41.760
They're in a Nissan pickup.

53:41.760 --> 53:44.012
Find them!

53:44.012 --> 53:45.722
We have our scouts
searching now.

53:54.606 --> 53:56.483
Highway one is straight ahead.

54:02.448 --> 54:03.866
What are you doing?

54:06.493 --> 54:09.121
I'm telling you
we are going the wrong way.

54:09.121 --> 54:10.789
No, it's a detour.

54:19.381 --> 54:20.507
Get down!

54:36.607 --> 54:38.734
God, I like this guy.
He is good.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.039
They got away...

54:52.039 --> 54:54.374
heading east from
the warehouse area.

55:21.777 --> 55:23.862
Oh, shit.

55:23.862 --> 55:25.739
Check for a spare tire
in the back.

55:30.619 --> 55:32.162
Oh, my God. Yes.

55:33.956 --> 55:36.333
Okay, I'll pull security.
You change the tire.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.550
Mo, Hurry up.
We're exposed out here.

55:44.550 --> 55:45.592
Yeah.

55:46.176 --> 55:47.844
Come on.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.389
What piece of shit!

55:50.389 --> 55:52.391
You do it yourself!

55:57.604 --> 56:00.357
It's the adrenaline.
You're coming down.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.734
Try to drink some water.
- Who was the guy on the bike?

56:02.734 --> 56:06.280
I need you to focus, okay?
Just change the fucking tire!

56:07.114 --> 56:08.532
Well...

56:08.532 --> 56:10.867
Well, well, I know...

56:10.867 --> 56:13.120
I know when I'm being lied to.

56:13.996 --> 56:15.581
Mo, where are you going?

56:15.581 --> 56:19.167
I came here
to find my wife's sister.

56:19.167 --> 56:21.920
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

56:21.920 --> 56:24.339
- Your wife's sister?
- Yes. She was missing.

56:24.339 --> 56:27.009
I'm not leaving Herat
until I find her.

56:27.009 --> 56:30.137
Well, you're not gonna find her
if you're fucking dead.

56:30.137 --> 56:31.805
Good luck to you.

56:48.822 --> 56:50.282
- Mo?
- Huh?

56:50.282 --> 56:52.159
Call him to come out.

57:04.921 --> 57:07.257
Tom, Tom,
he's just a little boy.

57:14.056 --> 57:16.141
Tell him to drop it.

57:26.902 --> 57:28.487
Jesus.

57:38.830 --> 57:41.500
You won't make it
on your own, Mo.

57:41.500 --> 57:43.794
Then tell me
what's truly going on.

57:47.422 --> 57:49.341
This is my life in your hands.

57:51.510 --> 57:54.596
I burned their house down
in Iran.

57:54.596 --> 57:56.264
The nuclear reactor?

58:00.268 --> 58:03.063
Why can't CIA agents
just come and pick us up?

58:03.063 --> 58:05.774
We're cutouts
in an even bigger game.

58:05.774 --> 58:09.194
But what it means is
no one is coming to rescue us.

58:10.362 --> 58:11.488
Okay?

58:12.948 --> 58:16.284
So we just got to
get to Kandahar,

58:16.284 --> 58:17.828
and then we'll regroup,

58:22.541 --> 58:24.418
Okay?

58:24.418 --> 58:26.545
And then I'll help you
find your wife's sister.

58:28.422 --> 58:30.966
I'm sorry, Mo.

58:30.966 --> 58:33.051
I should have told you
the truth earlier.

59:18.722 --> 59:21.600
He went that way!

59:27.647 --> 59:30.609
Do you really think
we can make it to Kandahar?

59:30.609 --> 59:33.445
Not without help.

59:33.445 --> 59:36.198
There's someone I've worked with
before south of here.

59:37.324 --> 59:39.201
And maybe he has a helicopter.

59:41.036 --> 59:42.537
Let's go.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.357
Ismail on phone: <i>Asalamualaikum.</i>

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:13.068
Ismail, it's Roman.

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:14.611
Look, I need a favor.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:19.449
Iranian pigs go home!

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.661
Traitors!

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:26.498
The Taliban are letting us take
the body back to Tehran.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:34.005
Hi, my love.

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:35.382
When will you be
coming home?

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:38.009
I want to make us dinner.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:40.053
I'm going to be late.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.640
Is everything alright?

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:49.020
I'll be back as
soon as I can.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.523
Give Camila a kiss from Baba.

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:54.818
Okay.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:57.737
Stay safe Farzad.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.927
Do you know who I am?

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.847
I.S.I.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.724
What are
you doing out here?

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:27.726
Protecting the road
from Takfiris,

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:31.021
non-believers and enemies
of the Taliban.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.439
I can build IEDS,

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:37.402
fire rifles, AKs, M4s
and Sig Sauers.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:46.119
Have you read the Quran
for yourself?

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.498
No right?

01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:52.208
Then how can you know
what it means,

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:56.212
to be a true believer?

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:59.007
You might find it to be very different...

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:02.928
from what they're telling you
it says.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.186
Hey little one...

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:13.104
have you seen this man?

01:02:13.104 --> 01:02:14.439
Mm-hmm.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:16.608
Do you know where he was going?

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:20.362
Toward Delaram.

01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:21.696
Huh.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.450
Thank you.

How much longer
to your friend?

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:10.597
About another 20 miles or so.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:17.937
Do you hear this?

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:22.025
- Yeah.
- I-- I...

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:25.361
I think there is something wrong
with the tire again.

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:30.450
That's not our car.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.387
Take the shot!

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:58.311
Take the wheel, Mo!

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:06.444
- I can't see where I'm going!
- Just keep it straight!

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:08.905
We're taking fire.

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:52.157
Fire another shot!

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:01.416
Ah!

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.293
He's hit!

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.464
The engine's down!

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.175
Get ready to bail.

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:14.304
Let's go! Move, move!

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:26.941
Run, Mo!

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.196
Where?
Just run!

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.773
Land!

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.244
Split up... Flank their position.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.329
Copy.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.243
You'll always be...

01:09:35.963 --> 01:09:39.425
They'll circle back around.
Stay down, don't move.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:40.635
Alright.

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:16.587
There!

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:19.841
Kill him.

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:51.622
Oh, God,
forgive our living and our dead.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.999
Yeah, used me as bait.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.502
But it worked.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:08.055
- Looks like we're on foot.
- Huh.

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:12.393
We're-we're refueling the UAV.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:15.563
- Where are they now?
- We've lost 'em.

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:19.442
- Has Roman checked in?
- No. Why?

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:23.446
- Copy.
- Should I be worried?

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:27.325
If those were my guys,
I'd be blowing up your phone

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:28.451
every ten minutes.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.758
Are you sure you don't want me
to wait up for ya?

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.635
What are you gonna do
if we can't find you?

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:48.804
I'm practically the only
white dude left in this country.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:52.183
Can't be too hard to find.
Get home safe, brother.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:34.100
Are you ready...
to fight for Allah?

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.813
Ah.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:44.944
May the dust rise
and the apostles hear a cry.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.740
Let's do it.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.308
I have to pray.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:22.940
Ah.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:29.530
Ah. My knees are killing me.

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:32.325
Here. Ah.

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:33.909
Take this.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:48.841
Thank you.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:35.763
Thank you.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.985
Not exactly best way
to break a fast,

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:53.322
but it's all I've got.

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:07.878
Mm...

01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:17.555
Battle buddy?

01:15:22.977 --> 01:15:24.687
His name is Siddiqui.

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:30.609
He was my translator
through six tours.

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:35.906
For six fucking tours.

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:40.411
Tried to get him
to the, the US or London.

01:15:40.411 --> 01:15:42.872
Anywhere safe.

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:45.416
Then ISIS rode through Mosul...

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:47.626
and they hung him.

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:50.379
My pleader.

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:56.927
Yeah, we rely on you guys
for everything.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:02.725
I mean, the language,
the culture.

01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:08.731
You risk your lives for us...

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:13.110
and then we tell you exactly

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:16.363
what your country should look
like and how you should act.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.453
Half the time
we don't even say thank you.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:27.708
Oh, no, I'm glad you made it
to the States, Mo.

01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:30.669
Got your family out.

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:33.923
Not all of them made it.

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:40.221
My oldest son, Hamid,
was killed here.

01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:48.562
Are you married?

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.400
I was.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.821
- Do you have kids?
- I do.

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:59.615
I have a, a photo.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:11.919
Ida. She's, uh,
she's, uh, 17.

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:13.629
She's beautiful.

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:16.715
Ah. Thanks.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:23.931
I was supposed to be
at her graduation this weekend.

01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:26.809
You have to go home, Tom.

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:32.356
You have to go home
and hold her in your arms

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:35.693
before you even forget
what it feels like.

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:40.531
See, my, my Hamid is gone,

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:44.243
and all I have left
is just the picture.

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:50.791
You know, it's funny.

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:56.130
Here I am,
talking to a guy I barely know.

01:17:58.048 --> 01:18:02.970
Somehow, I, I'm more comfortable
with you than I am with family.

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:13.105

That's a flag of Tajik warlord.

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:55.916
I know.

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:02.881
Say we're friends
of Ismail Rabbani.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:04.842
We're asking Rabbani for help?

01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:07.302
Do it before they get
trigger-happy, Mo.

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.143
<i>Salam Alaikum.</i>

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.844
Ismail Rabbani.
Heh-heh.

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:34.515
My friend, your face
is all over the news.

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:36.809
Ah.
Good to see you.

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:42.648
Been too long.
This is, uh, Mohammed.

01:21:48.028 --> 01:21:49.863
<i>Asalamualaikum.</i>

01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:55.994
<i>Wa-alaikum-salam.</i>

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:03.836
So what brings you
to Farah?

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:05.504
We have to get to Kandahar.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:08.006
Oh, if you'd only
come by yesterday,

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:10.551
I would have flown you myself.

01:22:10.551 --> 01:22:12.177
Well, the Taliban
borrow my helicopter

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:14.138
for operation in the north. Hm.

01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:18.684
I can give you a truck.
I have plenty of those.

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:20.769
You will be there
in three hours.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.855
My brother.
We are about to eat.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.439
Are you hungry?

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:32.114
Our morning's work.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:40.497
Sure had some good times
together, huh,

01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:43.292
facing them Osama's boys.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:46.461
Yeah, we gave them a run for
their money. That's for sure.

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:49.298
Feels like a lifetime ago,
but don't worry,

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:52.050
soon we will be
all back at it again.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.094
The harder you try to stamp out
an ideology,

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:55.888
the stronger it becomes.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.145
No, thank you.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:04.479
Hm?

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.609
Hm. What is
with the good Muslim boy?

01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:15.073
Ah.

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:18.744
It must feel...
strange for you.

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.162
Like a lion tamer,

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:23.207
entering the cage,
without his whip.

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:26.001
Neither American, nor Afghan.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.586
You have no place.

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:33.342
I know who you really are.

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:34.885
Me?

01:23:35.886 --> 01:23:37.721
Enlighten me.

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.598
You are a traitor.

01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:47.231
Mo... what are you doing?

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:51.276
Your friend is a warlord
who razed Herat.

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:53.111
It was only business.

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:56.573
A higher bidder paid me for it.

01:23:56.573 --> 01:23:58.075
And I will do it again
just like I did

01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:00.911
for the Russians,
I did it for ISI.

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:04.581
I did it for Americans
and I will do it for Taliban.

01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:09.127
You killed
thousands. Women and children.

01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:11.713
One of them was my son.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:21.431
Your son?

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:29.731
I am... truly sorry.

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:31.024
Ismail, well--

01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:32.526
You want revenge?

01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:35.696
Is that what you want? Huh?

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:39.491
Is that it, revenge?
An eye for an eye?

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:42.828
Hm.

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:50.460
Here, take it. It is only fair.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.963
A violent act must be met
with another.

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:59.511
Go ahead. Take it.

01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:12.524
Ismail, come on.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.484
Stay out of it, Tom.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.697
Hm.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:21.825
Ever hear the story
of the Afghan man

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:24.161
who lived for 700 years?

01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:30.625
On his 700th birthday, the great
Amir, Dost Mohammad Khan,

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:32.419
threw him a, a lavish party.

01:25:32.419 --> 01:25:35.088
And after all the guests
had left,

01:25:35.088 --> 01:25:39.676
the Amir said in confidence,
"I am surrounded by enemies."

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:45.932
"What is your secret to be
living in such dangerous place

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:48.602
for a long time?"

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:51.021
And the man looked at him
and said...

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:56.693
"It is easy. Change sides."

01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:00.197
I know the story.

01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:06.536
And this way,

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:10.415
our country can never be as one.

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:18.256
God might not
forgive your sins...

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:26.264
...but I do.

01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:34.439
But I do.

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:35.899
Mo.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:38.944
Ismail.

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:49.663
Oh.

01:26:55.502 --> 01:26:59.673
I-- I'm so sorry, Mo.
I-- I had no idea.

01:26:59.673 --> 01:27:03.301
You called him your brother.
Do you know how insulting this?

01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:05.887
He killed my son
and thousands more

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:09.015
because of you and people
like you empowering him

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:11.226
without caring about my people!

01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:14.729
Shame on you.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.857
Shame on you.

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.818
For you.

01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:25.240
Look, we can refuse his help

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.535
and we just walk out of here.
You wanna do that, I'm in.

01:27:28.535 --> 01:27:31.413
Oh.

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.957
I just want to go.

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:38.003
I want to go to my family.
That's it.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:41.006
I just want to go home.

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:47.554
Mo, this is our best chance.

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:22.464
<i>Asalamualaikum.</i>

01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:55.830
<i>Behenchod.</i>

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:00.794
Hello?

01:29:00.794 --> 01:29:03.463
Our target is heading
to Kandahar.

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:07.008
His flight is leaving
in six hours.

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:12.973
He is traveling
in an old ANA truck.

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:14.891
I will catch
this spy for you.

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:17.352
Good.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:19.854
But after that
I want a transfer.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:22.399
I am sick of the desert...

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:25.402
This place
is like a rotting corpse.

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:27.946
Then where would you
like to go Kahil?

01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:30.323
London.

01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:34.286
Paris.

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:35.495
I don't know

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:38.707
Okay I promise...
that you will get all the

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:41.585
western "culture" you want.

01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:45.005
Only if you get
this job done for me.

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.515
Rasoul, it is me.

01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:14.451
Did you think that this will
ever end?

01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:21.666
Ancient wars were fought
for spoils.

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:25.670
Modern wars
aren't meant to be won.

01:30:32.135 --> 01:30:33.845
Tom!

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:07.587
Fucking Ismail.

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:13.760
You should have shot him.

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:49.546
The Paks can have your friend.

01:31:49.546 --> 01:31:52.298
Or the Iranians.

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:54.134
I don't care about him.

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:59.556
But you
will never leave here.

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:03.393
Traitor.

01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:06.354
You must pay for your sins.

01:32:07.397 --> 01:32:09.315
Rasoul.

01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:11.735
ISIS is attacking us!

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:25.457
Go! Go!

01:33:05.914 --> 01:33:07.540
Go there, go!

01:33:25.058 --> 01:33:27.852
ISIS fighters
are attacking us!

01:33:27.852 --> 01:33:29.395
ISIS are you sure?

01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:31.689
They have heavy weapons!

01:33:31.689 --> 01:33:33.775
I need air support now.

01:33:33.775 --> 01:33:34.651
You hear me!

01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:35.443
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Rasoul, don't be a bitch.

01:33:36.903 --> 01:33:38.071
Hold them off until I get there.

01:33:38.071 --> 01:33:39.030
I'm coming for the target.

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:40.323
Rasoul.

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:48.331
Pakistani asshole!

01:34:04.264 --> 01:34:05.431
Ah!

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.371
Hit the gate!

01:34:29.122 --> 01:34:30.373
Hit the gate!

01:34:58.568 --> 01:35:00.069
<i>Allahu-Akbar!</i>

01:35:20.924 --> 01:35:22.258
They broke through the gate!

01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:24.969
Everyone to the gate!

01:35:39.442 --> 01:35:40.818
Hello, Thomas.

01:35:40.818 --> 01:35:42.570
Oh, fuck you.

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.864
- It's not funny. Ah.
- You okay?

01:35:44.864 --> 01:35:46.991
What happened?
How did you get here, man?

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:48.534
Rode in with my Afghan.

01:35:48.534 --> 01:35:51.955
Special Forces buddies,
pretending to be ISIS.

01:35:51.955 --> 01:35:54.791
- Uh, pretty good, huh?
- Oh, fuck.

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:56.668
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
What about Mo?

01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:58.836
He's in here somewhere.

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:00.338
Let's go find him.

01:36:10.348 --> 01:36:11.599
Mo?

01:36:12.558 --> 01:36:13.768
Mo?

01:36:19.148 --> 01:36:21.526
Mo? Mo?

01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:23.528
Uh...

01:36:24.904 --> 01:36:27.365
Oh. Motherfucker!

01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:29.200
Roman, in here.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.704
You okay? I got you, Mo.
I got you. Jesus.

01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:34.497
I'm sorry, Mo.

01:36:34.497 --> 01:36:38.835
Come on. You get up.

01:36:38.835 --> 01:36:41.462
Out of here.
Out of here.

01:36:48.428 --> 01:36:50.096
That's not ISIS.

01:36:50.096 --> 01:36:51.139
What?

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:52.765
They're Afghan Commandos.

01:36:56.352 --> 01:36:58.062
Almost there. Hang on...

01:37:00.982 --> 01:37:03.443
Ah.

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:05.194
What about your SF guys?
Can we get them out?

01:37:08.614 --> 01:37:10.783
They are never gonna
stop fighting.

01:37:23.546 --> 01:37:26.591
We'll cut them off
at Maiwand.

01:37:26.591 --> 01:37:28.384
An old CIA base
is near there.

01:37:28.384 --> 01:37:30.553
The Brits have
an inbound plane.

01:37:30.553 --> 01:37:31.637
This is Agent Nazir.

01:37:31.637 --> 01:37:34.807
All Taliban Red
unit and Badri 313...

01:37:34.807 --> 01:37:38.853
Prepare to stage in Maiwand.

01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:42.940
Sir, there they are.

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.442
Woman 1: Moving in with Reaper.

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:46.903
Man 1: Confirming signal
from town's blue force.

01:38:10.426 --> 01:38:12.095
This guy doesn't quit.

01:38:13.346 --> 01:38:14.806
No, he doesn't.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.646
Stay close.

01:38:24.232 --> 01:38:25.817
Stay on the fence line.

01:38:25.817 --> 01:38:27.819
There's a perimeter gate
four klicks up.

01:38:47.088 --> 01:38:48.881
He's right on our ass.

01:39:00.226 --> 01:39:01.519
Ah!

01:39:25.209 --> 01:39:26.460
Ah!

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.925
Everybody okay? Mo, good?

01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:35.303
Ah, it's Roman. Oh, my God!

01:39:35.303 --> 01:39:36.888
- Shit.
- Ah.

01:39:36.888 --> 01:39:39.390
- Roman.
- He's bleeding very badly.

01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:41.392
Mo, find something
to pack him with. Quick.

01:39:41.392 --> 01:39:43.686
It's alright. It's alright.

01:39:47.106 --> 01:39:49.901
Roman, just hang on, okay?

01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:51.777
we're gonna make it
to the flight.

01:39:53.863 --> 01:39:55.531
- Roman!
- No, Roman!

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:01.996
Tom, we have to go back.

01:40:29.398 --> 01:40:31.067
Get the bike ready.

01:40:54.757 --> 01:41:00.346
There is no God...
except Allah.

01:41:02.348 --> 01:41:09.146
And... Muhammad is...

01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:15.319
...The messenger of Allah.

01:41:15.319 --> 01:41:19.282
The Gentle...

01:41:21.033 --> 01:41:26.080
The Merciful... The Kind...

01:41:35.298 --> 01:41:37.049
This is Agent Nazir.

01:41:37.049 --> 01:41:38.217
Mortar team on my signal.

01:41:53.858 --> 01:41:56.027
Fire at the Land Cruiser!

01:41:56.027 --> 01:41:58.279
Now! Now!

01:42:04.493 --> 01:42:05.995
Alright, Mo. Get ready.

01:42:07.371 --> 01:42:08.539
Ah.

01:42:13.502 --> 01:42:17.131
Hang on, Mo.
Almost there!

01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:20.384
- We are not gonna make it, Tom.
- We're gonna make it.

01:42:24.138 --> 01:42:26.057
Copy, Bravo Six.
Prepare for landing.

01:42:39.945 --> 01:42:43.491
Man 1: Multiple bogies emerging
from the north and east.

01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:44.992
RPG's spotted on the left window.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:46.494
Woman 1: ETA on the Brit slide
is one minute.

01:42:46.494 --> 01:42:48.204
Christ, they're gonna
block the gate.

01:42:48.204 --> 01:42:49.705
Tell the birds
to hold the plane.

01:42:49.705 --> 01:42:50.748
Copy.

01:42:57.004 --> 01:42:59.423
Roger, Bravo Six.
Move your best to hold.

01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:01.801
However, we have targeted civilian...

01:43:01.801 --> 01:43:03.135
Come, let's go, boys.

01:43:10.476 --> 01:43:12.061
I see the gate.

01:43:14.605 --> 01:43:16.482
Don't let them
enter the base.

01:43:46.095 --> 01:43:48.597
- Hm?
- Tom?

01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:49.974
Stop all fire.

01:43:49.974 --> 01:43:52.101
All Taliban forces
hold your position.

01:43:59.108 --> 01:44:02.945
The traget is mine.
I'm going in.

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:25.926
Stay here.

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.354
He is going to kill you.

01:44:39.356 --> 01:44:40.858
Then I won't be lying down.

01:45:20.064 --> 01:45:21.774
Fuck.

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:49.301
I've got you.

01:45:49.301 --> 01:45:51.595
I got you. Huh.

01:46:01.272 --> 01:46:02.982
Oh, shit.

01:46:03.607 --> 01:46:05.150
I'm sorry, Mo.

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:07.486
I let you down.

01:46:12.324 --> 01:46:13.826
God's plan.

01:46:14.493 --> 01:46:16.078
God's plan?

01:46:20.499 --> 01:46:23.627
Man 1: Counting up to 50-plus
bogies converging on the base.

01:46:24.837 --> 01:46:27.298
What's our Reaper armed with?

01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:29.216
Man 2: She'd be using
Hellfire, sir.

01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:33.846
Text the pilot. Do it now.

01:46:33.846 --> 01:46:36.348
What are you doing?

01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:38.225
We don't have the authority.

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:42.021
Fuck the authority.
They can fire me.

01:46:42.021 --> 01:46:44.481
I won't watch anymore of our men
die today.

01:46:47.359 --> 01:46:51.238
Tom...

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:52.948
it's been an honor.

01:46:54.783 --> 01:46:56.452
Be honest, mate.

01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:35.199
Let's go home, Mo.

01:47:36.408 --> 01:47:37.701
Let's go.

01:48:01.809 --> 01:48:04.103
Go! Quick.

01:48:28.961 --> 01:48:30.254
Come on.

01:48:32.381 --> 01:48:33.590
Ah. Ah.

01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:35.634
We got wounded! We got wounded!

01:48:35.634 --> 01:48:37.094
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep moving.

01:48:37.094 --> 01:48:38.804
- Get a medic on it.
- Go! Let's go!

01:48:38.804 --> 01:48:40.472
Let's go, let's go!
