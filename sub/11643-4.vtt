35:34.280 --> 35:36.919
What?

35:36.920 --> 35:39.519
Do I know you?

35:39.520 --> 35:43.519
I... I thought
you were someone else.

35:48.160 --> 35:52.159
What happened?

35:52.200 --> 35:56.199
We were doing our community
service...

35:57.880 --> 36:01.879
..and the probation worker
flipped out. Just...

36:04.000 --> 36:05.559
Just went crazy and then...

36:05.560 --> 36:09.559
Then he killed them.

36:13.080 --> 36:17.079
How come you survived?

36:17.160 --> 36:21.159
They said I was half dead
when they found me.

36:24.440 --> 36:28.439
I guess I'm just lucky.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.479
I didn't stop him.

36:32.480 --> 36:32.999
Argh!

36:33.000 --> 36:35.199
Argh!
What's that?

36:35.200 --> 36:37.159
Did you know them?

36:37.160 --> 36:40.159
I wasn't there.

36:40.160 --> 36:43.079
I wasn't there.

36:43.080 --> 36:47.079
I should've been caught.
I could've stopped this.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.359
I wasn't there.

36:51.360 --> 36:55.359
I wasn't there.

37:05.320 --> 37:09.319
# SKEPTA: Rolex Sweep

37:12.600 --> 37:16.039
# Do the Rolex sweep
Rolex sweep, Rolex sweep

37:16.040 --> 37:20.039
# Rolex sweep, Rolex sweep

37:20.200 --> 37:21.519
# I told her to drink up

37:21.520 --> 37:24.199
# Selecta, play the song
that I asked for

37:24.200 --> 37:25.479
# If you wanna link up... #

37:25.480 --> 37:26.919
Who sold it to you?

37:26.920 --> 37:29.679
It's only one wrap.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.719
Come on!

37:30.720 --> 37:32.639
I'm a good girl, really.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.799
You're not flirting
your way out of this.

37:34.800 --> 37:38.559
You either tell me who sold it to
you or you get done for possession.

37:38.560 --> 37:42.519
It's up to you.

37:42.520 --> 37:43.639
It's him.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.399
Guy in the black jacket.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.239
# Do the Rolex sweep

37:48.240 --> 37:50.799
# Do the Rolex sweep
C-C-Count with me... #

37:50.800 --> 37:54.799
Go on. Piss off!

37:55.480 --> 37:56.999
# Do the Rolex sweep

37:57.000 --> 37:58.919
# One, one, one, one

37:58.920 --> 38:00.919
# Two, two, two, two... #

38:00.920 --> 38:04.519
You got the money?

38:04.520 --> 38:06.439
# I told her to drink up

38:06.440 --> 38:09.479
# Selecta, play the song
that I asked for

38:09.480 --> 38:12.119
# If you wanna link up
you can meet me on the dance floor

38:12.120 --> 38:15.999
# 50 Cent can't dance like me
Soulja Boy can't dance like me

38:16.000 --> 38:17.679
# Michael Jackson can't dance like
me... #

38:17.680 --> 38:18.999
Hey!

38:19.000 --> 38:20.119
Police!

38:20.120 --> 38:23.079
SHOUTING

38:23.080 --> 38:26.599
Oh! Fuck!

38:26.600 --> 38:28.479
Hey! Hey!

38:28.480 --> 38:30.599
Oh! Fuck!

38:30.600 --> 38:33.799
Police! Open the door right now!

38:33.800 --> 38:36.399
BANGING AT DOOR

38:36.400 --> 38:38.639
You're only making this
worse for yourself!

38:38.640 --> 38:40.679
Open up! Fuck!

38:40.680 --> 38:42.199
TOILET FLUSHES

38:42.200 --> 38:44.079
You've got nowhere to go.

38:44.080 --> 38:48.079
Open up!

38:48.680 --> 38:50.359
Don't waste my time!

38:50.360 --> 38:51.759
Argh!

38:51.760 --> 38:55.759
Arms up.

38:59.760 --> 39:02.239
Looks like you forgot to flush one.

39:02.240 --> 39:06.239
I'm arresting you for possession.

39:07.480 --> 39:11.479
I saw you running last year.
They'll ban you for this.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.479
What's going to happen to her?

39:14.480 --> 39:18.479
She didn't have anything on her.
She's free to go. Come on.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.999
Curtis.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.359
(GASPS)

39:32.360 --> 39:36.359
ALARM BEEPS

40:15.800 --> 40:17.319
Hi.

40:17.320 --> 40:21.319
# THE SPECIALS:
A Message To You, Rudy

40:33.760 --> 40:35.999
Hi.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.999
# Stop your messin' around

40:40.800 --> 40:43.519
# Better think of your future... #

40:43.520 --> 40:44.519
It's good to see you.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.519
It's good to see you.
You saw me yesterday.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.039
What you doing?

41:00.040 --> 41:04.039
Trust me. We need to lock the door.

41:05.200 --> 41:08.239
MOANING AND PANTING

41:08.240 --> 41:11.279
(WHISTLES IDLY)

41:11.280 --> 41:13.919
LOUD MOANING

41:13.920 --> 41:17.919
BANGING ON DOOR

41:19.240 --> 41:23.239
PANTING

41:24.840 --> 41:26.599
Are you two shagging in there?

41:29.360 --> 41:30.879
Well, how long you gonna be?

41:30.880 --> 41:32.319
Will you piss off?

41:32.320 --> 41:33.959
CLASHING

41:33.960 --> 41:37.959
OK. Just give us a shout
when you're done.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.919
Does anyone actually know
what he got done for?

41:44.920 --> 41:46.359
Says it was for eating pick 'n' mix.

41:46.360 --> 41:49.559
Says it was for eating pick 'n' mix.
That's bullshit.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.079
Are you two, like, together?

41:51.080 --> 41:53.039
Yeah, I guess.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.319
It's weird, yeah.

41:54.320 --> 41:58.319
Cos of my bullshit power thing,
we don't actually have proper sex.

41:58.320 --> 42:01.959
We just stare at each other
and wank ourselves off.

42:01.960 --> 42:05.959
But it is really special.

42:12.920 --> 42:15.599
Come on, buddy. It's not gay
if I wank you off with the grabber.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.119
We're not touching.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.959
All you wanna do is get down to it,
but you can't.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.039
That's disgusting.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.599
That's disgusting.
It's not fucking disgusting. >

42:21.600 --> 42:25.599
Hi!

42:26.840 --> 42:29.159
What are you doing here?

42:29.160 --> 42:30.919
I was in the neighbourhood.

42:30.920 --> 42:34.159
I miss you
when you're stuck here all day.

42:34.160 --> 42:38.159
Are you just going to stand there
or are you going to do something
about it?

42:45.160 --> 42:49.159
Shit!

43:36.080 --> 43:40.079
Tony.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.639
Pervert!

43:46.640 --> 43:47.439
He's such a twat.

43:47.440 --> 43:48.599
He's such a twat.
He is a twat.

43:48.600 --> 43:49.999
We have outfoxed the fox,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.399
which makes us very bloody foxy.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.599
It's not easy being you, is it?

43:54.600 --> 43:56.039
Have you seen Curtis?

43:56.040 --> 43:57.559
Who are you?
I'm his girlfriend.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.079
Oh...

43:59.080 --> 44:01.319
I thought that was you.
Do you want a lift?

44:01.320 --> 44:03.239
Alisha, it isn't how it sounds.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.079
How long
have you been with her?

44:05.080 --> 44:07.079
Why don't you call round my house
and I'll cook dinner?

44:07.080 --> 44:08.599
Why don't you call round my house
and I'll cook dinner?
Are you asking me around for sex?

44:08.600 --> 44:10.719
Nathan's stealing a baby.
It's all right.

44:10.720 --> 44:11.719
Why would he take a baby?

44:11.720 --> 44:13.759
Why would he take a baby?
You're acting like a freak.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.639
What have I told you about
filming us on that thing?

44:15.640 --> 44:19.639
Well, look at you, using
your powers, being all superhero.

44:20.080 --> 44:24.079
They're the only friends I've got.
