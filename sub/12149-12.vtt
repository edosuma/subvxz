00:10.929 --> 00:12.230
You look nice.

00:15.130 --> 00:18.320
- And now I look like the Joker.
- Sorry.

00:19.329 --> 00:22.420
Hopefully, I'm too young
and carefree for a coronary.

00:22.929 --> 00:26.440
- Can't you hum when sneaking up on me?
- I don't hum.

00:27.129 --> 00:31.170
I'm confused here.
Why is Mrs. Bensen filed under "P"?

00:31.929 --> 00:34.600
It's not a "P," it's an "F."
Or is it an "R"?

00:35.530 --> 00:39.149
Can we be a little less
"Young and carefree" with the filing?

00:39.729 --> 00:41.939
Oh, it's an "F."  I remember now.

00:43.929 --> 00:47.189
All right, so why is
Mrs. Bensen filed under "F"?

00:47.530 --> 00:49.740
Because she is from France.

00:51.130 --> 00:54.179
- She was such a pain.
- Made me want to drink a lot.

00:54.729 --> 00:57.890
- Well, that's the French for you.
- Hello.

00:58.329 --> 01:02.090
I was just patrolling the area
with my new Bavarian fighting ax...

01:03.130 --> 01:06.180
...when I thought,
"Perhaps Cordelia's had a vision...

01:06.730 --> 01:08.590
...and needs help battling evil."

01:09.129 --> 01:11.129
We're evil-free at the moment.

01:12.129 --> 01:16.310
I also packed Word Puzzle 3-D
if you have the nerve to take me on.

01:17.530 --> 01:21.920
Wesley, I'd love to, but unlike you,
I'm not in my 80s quite yet.

01:22.930 --> 01:26.579
If shaking your booty at the latest
club is your idea of a life...

01:27.129 --> 01:28.390
...then call me--

01:28.930 --> 01:30.120
--sick with envy.

01:30.730 --> 01:33.010
Hi, I'm Sarina.  Nice ax.

01:33.730 --> 01:36.750
Oh, no, this old thing.  I--

01:38.530 --> 01:42.849
Wilson almost had phone sex with the
manager at Lounge La Brea to get us in.

01:43.930 --> 01:46.140
- How do I look?
- Like you always do.

01:46.329 --> 01:49.629
- Wilson's eyes will be glued on you.
- Who's Wilson?

01:50.530 --> 01:52.560
- Christopher.
- Christopher Wilson.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.480
- Wilson Christopher.
- The archaeologist from Brandeis?

01:57.129 --> 02:01.700
The photographer from L.A. Cordelia's
been seeing.  Third time's the charm.

02:02.530 --> 02:05.620
And that Hugh Grant thing
is starting to work for me.

02:07.329 --> 02:11.469
So you've been seeing someone.
How come I didn't know?

02:12.129 --> 02:16.060
I'm ashamed of you.  You'd embarrass
me by giving him the third degree.

02:16.930 --> 02:19.319
He could give me
the third degree anytime.

02:21.129 --> 02:22.669
You're a sucker for....

02:22.930 --> 02:27.139
- Cordelia, grab that file.  Sorry.
- Not to worry.  Whoopsie.

02:27.729 --> 02:30.750
Lounge La Brea.  Sounds like
that could be an evening...

02:31.930 --> 02:34.389
...with all sorts of evening-type--

02:34.930 --> 02:37.030
- I heard the bands--
- There are no bands.

02:37.330 --> 02:39.680
- Which I like.  If it's loud--
- Want to come?

02:40.330 --> 02:42.259
Oh, I think I may be busy.

02:46.930 --> 02:50.689
Besides, I don't lounge all that well.

02:52.930 --> 02:56.479
Good one!  Oh, yes.
No, he's no lounger, this one.

02:57.129 --> 02:58.919
The good ones are always gay.

02:59.530 --> 03:01.490
Cor, tick-tock.

03:01.930 --> 03:04.810
So that client I'm meeting,
what's he like again?

03:05.530 --> 03:09.430
Like a big baby hatching from
a big egg with really large hands...

03:09.729 --> 03:12.639
...in need of a manicure.
You're meeting him here.

03:18.129 --> 03:19.139
Okay.

03:19.930 --> 03:21.719
Are my girls ready to party?

03:23.530 --> 03:27.110
I don't suppose you need help
slaying the big baby creature?

03:27.729 --> 03:31.840
Not that an evening alone with a
word puzzle isn't plenty exhilarating.

03:32.530 --> 03:33.689
Right.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:58.930 --> 04:01.139
Don't move a muscle. Demon spawn!

04:02.530 --> 04:06.879
Cowards, don't make me thrash it out
of you.  Where do you lay your eggs?

04:07.930 --> 04:09.469
In the cellar?

04:09.729 --> 04:11.900
- Wesley.
- In the bedroom?

04:12.129 --> 04:16.029
That's right, termites lay their
eggs anywhere, such as next door.

04:23.529 --> 04:26.370
And we fight termites,
wherever they may roam.

04:29.529 --> 04:31.110
Sorry about the door.

05:29.490 --> 05:30.889
Look out, Wesley!

05:32.490 --> 05:33.569
Duck!

05:49.889 --> 05:51.569
You'll pay for that!

06:04.290 --> 06:05.829
- That was bracing.
- Yeah.

06:06.089 --> 06:09.949
Baby just hatched.  Wouldn't want
to run into him when he grows up...

06:10.889 --> 06:12.639
...and gets his driver's license.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.750
And thank you very much, Cordelia...

06:16.290 --> 06:18.500
...for sending us to the wrong house.

06:19.290 --> 06:22.310
Another five minutes, and
that thing would've been loose.

06:22.889 --> 06:25.870
- Well, it all worked out.
- This time.

06:26.490 --> 06:28.560
Maybe we should clean up--

06:30.089 --> 06:32.860
Think a Tahval demon
has a big security deposit?

06:33.089 --> 06:34.279
I'm sure of it.

06:34.889 --> 06:38.120
Well, it's not my place,
Cordelia works for you...

06:39.089 --> 06:41.160
...but she's not doing
her duty lately.

06:41.490 --> 06:44.899
She's dealing with a lot.
Doyle's death, visions, youth.

06:45.689 --> 06:48.319
- She's finding her way in the world.
- We're not in the world.

06:48.689 --> 06:51.879
- Demon hunters have a higher calling.
- You....

06:54.089 --> 06:55.810
I'm very fond of Cordelia.

06:55.889 --> 06:59.509
- But she's gad-abouting with doxies--
- I think they liked you.

07:00.089 --> 07:01.319
Really?

07:02.490 --> 07:06.250
I didn't mean "doxy" in the sexually
promiscuous sense, exactly.

07:07.290 --> 07:10.480
- You don't think the ax put them off?
- That was charming.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.379
- The fact they think we're gay?
- Adds mystery.

07:17.129 --> 07:18.000
- Here.
- Thanks.

07:18.329 --> 07:21.100
- Don't mention it.
- I won't.  But I'll tip for it.

07:21.930 --> 07:23.189
Jason, moola.

07:26.730 --> 07:27.670
Thanks.

07:27.930 --> 07:30.250
I'm not saying
it was worthy of a kiss.

07:33.930 --> 07:35.750
I'm bored.

07:35.730 --> 07:38.470
Emily, do you know
what it takes to get in here?

07:39.329 --> 07:42.139
- Still bored.
- Well, Cordy's not.

07:43.529 --> 07:47.360
So you left Sunnydale and came to L.A.
What was that like?

07:48.329 --> 07:50.120
Skydiving without a parachute.

07:50.730 --> 07:52.939
Except for the "smashing
your body to bits" part.

07:53.129 --> 07:57.060
No, it was like that too.  And the guy
who's supposed to be here...

07:57.930 --> 08:01.019
- The guy?
- ...with the bag of fame and fortune.

08:01.529 --> 08:03.779
- Oh, that guy.
- So, what happened to him?

08:04.529 --> 08:07.550
He comes and goes.
He's sort of fleeting that way.

08:08.129 --> 08:10.730
If you see him,
tell him to fleet my way.

08:12.930 --> 08:15.069
- Thank you.
- For what?

08:15.329 --> 08:17.259
For making me not hate dating.

08:21.329 --> 08:22.730
Sarina's really something.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.399
I'm gonna send her flowers.

08:27.930 --> 08:29.540
For introducing you to me.

08:30.329 --> 08:31.449
I knew that.

08:35.129 --> 08:37.620
God, for the first time I like L.A.

08:38.730 --> 08:41.990
In high school, I knew my place.
It was a haughty place.

08:42.330 --> 08:45.980
- Maybe I was a tad shallow.
- Nobody feels like they belong here.

08:46.529 --> 08:50.360
The point of L.A. is to make
you feel as insecure as possible.

08:51.929 --> 08:53.330
You don't feel that way.

08:54.330 --> 08:55.200
Sure I do.

08:55.529 --> 08:57.559
You're doing what you came to do.

08:57.929 --> 09:00.909
You're photographing all
these gorgeous, famous people.

09:01.529 --> 09:04.230
- Where's the insecure?
- In the pictures.

09:05.129 --> 09:08.850
Which are further proof that
everyone has a real life except me.

09:09.330 --> 09:13.720
I'm the guy behind the camera,
recording life, not living it...

09:14.730 --> 09:16.240
...each and every moment.

09:17.129 --> 09:20.179
- Like you.
- Wow, I'm living life?

09:20.730 --> 09:21.669
Look at me.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.179
Look at you.

09:32.129 --> 09:33.950
Well, here we are.

09:36.330 --> 09:39.419
Thank you for the club
and for driving me home...

09:40.529 --> 09:42.809
...and listening
to my entire life story.

09:42.929 --> 09:45.669
I may have left out
a few weeks in early 1987, but--

09:46.529 --> 09:49.480
I had a great time,
and you didn't talk too much.

09:50.129 --> 09:54.730
- I want to know everything about you.
- Me too.  I mean, about you, not--

09:56.129 --> 09:59.080
Because I already know about me--

10:05.129 --> 10:06.250
Call you tomorrow?

10:08.730 --> 10:11.429
- You don't have to--
- Call you?

10:12.330 --> 10:13.519
--go home.

10:14.730 --> 10:17.750
I mean, right away.
It's still early...

10:18.330 --> 10:19.940
...in Australia.

10:23.129 --> 10:24.210
Will you come in?

10:31.529 --> 10:32.649
Nice.

10:32.730 --> 10:36.029
Compared to my old apartment,
it's Buckingham Palace.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.440
You live alone, right?

10:39.929 --> 10:43.580
In the sense that I'm the only one
here that's actually alive.

10:44.129 --> 10:45.639
That was a yes, I think.

10:46.529 --> 10:48.600
Wiring.  Old buildings.

10:48.929 --> 10:52.830
Well, no worries.
Besides, I like looking at you.

10:56.129 --> 10:59.960
Look, the truth is that my dating game
skills are kind of rusty.

11:00.929 --> 11:05.320
You're the first person I've
had over in a long--  Well, ever.

11:06.330 --> 11:09.070
So I'm open to suggestions.

11:09.929 --> 11:11.049
Music?

11:12.330 --> 11:14.470
Right.  Music.

11:22.529 --> 11:24.740
Hey, that's some jaunty polka.

11:27.330 --> 11:29.429
Oh, I know, I know.  The wiring.

11:31.529 --> 11:33.600
- How about tea?
- That'd be great.

11:34.529 --> 11:35.539
Okay.

11:40.210 --> 11:42.240
All right, Dennis, knock it off!

11:42.610 --> 11:45.799
This is the one guy
I've actually liked in a long time...

11:46.809 --> 11:49.759
...and if you keep killing
the mood, I'll kill you!

11:51.610 --> 11:56.179
All right, empty threat, you being
a ghost and already dead and all.

11:57.610 --> 12:00.629
But I'll do something worse.

12:01.210 --> 12:03.350
I'll play Evita around the clock.

12:03.610 --> 12:07.370
- The one with Madonna!
- Who are you talking to?

12:08.409 --> 12:10.370
My ghost.  I have a ghost.

12:10.809 --> 12:11.820
He's jealous.

12:15.009 --> 12:19.330
Kidding.  The apartment's great,
but things are always breaking...

12:21.009 --> 12:24.909
...and I have no one to complain to.
So just to keep myself company...

12:25.809 --> 12:27.740
...I talk to myself.

13:09.610 --> 13:10.870
Wilson?

13:17.409 --> 13:19.620
Somebody's gonna be late for work.

13:43.529 --> 13:45.250
- What time is it?
- 12:15.

13:45.929 --> 13:48.769
I left two messages.
She should have called back.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.720
Maybe she unplugged her phone
or slept somewhere else.

13:53.129 --> 13:57.129
Well, I guess we should....
Break open her door and trespass.

13:57.929 --> 13:59.299
Cordelia?

14:00.929 --> 14:02.820
I'm getting a bad feeling here.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.960
- I thought it was just me.
- This isn't like her.

14:06.330 --> 14:10.899
Avoiding her responsibilities?
Lately, it seems quite like her.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.799
I'm sure it'll all work out once we--

14:18.330 --> 14:19.519
Mother of God.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.509
- Angel?
- It's all right.  We're here.

14:27.330 --> 14:31.899
I'm ready to wake up now.
I don't seem to be waking up.

14:32.730 --> 14:35.679
- Help me.
- We will. What do you remember?

14:37.529 --> 14:41.570
We went to the club.  Wilson and I
just sort of hid out on this couch...

14:42.330 --> 14:46.610
...and we talked and talked
and then he drove me home.

14:47.730 --> 14:49.269
And I asked him in.

14:50.129 --> 14:51.809
He was really nice.

14:54.929 --> 14:55.870
And we--

14:56.730 --> 14:57.850
You know.

14:58.529 --> 15:02.149
It was normal.  He was normal.
And it was safe.

15:02.730 --> 15:04.240
It was all really safe.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.059
It's okay.
Have you talked to Wilson?

15:09.330 --> 15:10.490
No.

15:12.330 --> 15:14.259
I haven't talked to anyone.

15:15.929 --> 15:17.539
What would I say to him?

15:18.330 --> 15:22.830
"I had a really great time.  I think
you left something at my place."

15:24.929 --> 15:26.440
This isn't right.

15:26.730 --> 15:29.470
What's happening to you,
he may have some answers.

15:30.929 --> 15:34.120
- I can't.
- Dial his number and I'll talk to him.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.639
Oh, God.  I'm being punished.

15:42.929 --> 15:46.190
You're certainly not
being punished.  This is--

15:47.730 --> 15:49.450
We'll get to the bottom of it.

15:50.129 --> 15:54.059
This number has been
disconnected,  there's no new number,

15:56.730 --> 15:59.990
He's not answering right now.
I want you to rest.

16:00.929 --> 16:02.720
We're gonna handle this.

16:05.129 --> 16:06.139
You're not alone.

16:06.929 --> 16:09.250
That's sort of the problem, isn't it?

16:15.330 --> 16:18.240
Could you just leave me alone for now?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.100
We'll be right outside.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.559
- Thanks.
- Any luck with your contact?

17:00.210 --> 17:01.860
His phones are disconnected...

17:02.009 --> 17:04.990
...no unlisted numbers,
forwarding addresses or record.

17:05.608 --> 17:06.839
That's something.

17:07.410 --> 17:10.150
I'm guessing it's some
procrea-parasitic demon.

17:11.009 --> 17:14.940
A demon who can only reproduce
by implanting a human with its seed.

17:15.210 --> 17:18.690
Yes, I've heard of such entities.
The human mothers--

17:19.410 --> 17:21.690
Rarely live.
Ones who do, wish they hadn't.

17:22.410 --> 17:24.509
She could give birth at any moment.

17:24.809 --> 17:27.789
- You'll have to see what's inside her.
- Pardon me?

17:28.410 --> 17:31.430
- Prenatal exam.
- Oh, of course.  What about you?

17:32.009 --> 17:33.690
I'm gonna find Daddy.

17:44.009 --> 17:45.759
- I didn't see you.
- I get that a lot.

17:46.410 --> 17:48.480
- What can I get you?
- I need some help.

17:48.809 --> 17:51.410
- I'm busy.
- I won't take much of your time.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.829
My friend Cordelia was here.
Big smile, really pretty?

17:56.009 --> 17:57.940
We get a lot of that in here.

18:04.410 --> 18:06.230
- What's this?
- Probably an insult.

18:06.809 --> 18:10.460
You're always serving jerks who
think they can buy anything, right?

18:11.009 --> 18:11.920
Yeah.

18:12.809 --> 18:16.140
One of those jerks hurt my friend.
I need to find him fast.

18:18.809 --> 18:21.130
- Who was it?
- Wilson Christopher.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.769
Where do he and his friends hang?

18:24.210 --> 18:26.670
- Wherever Sarina tells them to.
- Sarina.

18:27.210 --> 18:29.240
- Yeah. You know her?
- Yeah.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.839
They're a pack.
Guys with money, girls with pretty.

18:33.809 --> 18:37.430
The girls decide what club's hot,
and Sarina rules the girls.

18:38.009 --> 18:39.519
- Thanks.
- You the boyfriend?

18:40.410 --> 18:42.730
No.  I'm family.

18:47.009 --> 18:48.549
Do you know what it is?

18:50.009 --> 18:50.990
Boy or girl?

18:53.009 --> 18:54.519
Shouldn't be long.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.150
I told them it was rather urgent.

18:59.009 --> 19:02.519
- You're carrying low.  I bet it's--
- Shut up!  Don't touch me!

19:08.609 --> 19:11.170
You're, what,
eight and a half months along?

19:12.210 --> 19:13.819
Feels like only yesterday.

19:14.609 --> 19:17.589
You left a lot of blanks
on the information form.

19:18.210 --> 19:19.750
Who's your previous doctor?

19:20.009 --> 19:23.170
- You're the only doctor we've seen--
- In California.

19:23.609 --> 19:25.150
We just moved here from England.

19:26.609 --> 19:27.769
Lovely country.

19:28.410 --> 19:30.660
So, how are you feeling?

19:31.410 --> 19:33.829
I'm as big as a house,
everything hurts, I--

19:34.410 --> 19:37.319
That's all normal.
Once your little one comes out...

19:38.009 --> 19:39.829
...you'll feel a lot better.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.269
God, it's a nightmare.

19:43.410 --> 19:44.640
Hormones.

19:44.609 --> 19:49.180
Mrs. Penborn, why don't you lie back?
We'll see what's baking in the oven.

19:55.410 --> 19:59.059
Have you chosen a name yet?
It's the hardest part for many.

20:04.410 --> 20:07.220
- Looks like somebody is having twins.
- Twins?!

20:08.009 --> 20:09.940
No, there's a third heartbeat.

20:12.210 --> 20:14.670
- There is another one.
- Five.

20:15.210 --> 20:16.750
Six.

20:19.410 --> 20:20.950
Oh, my God.

20:23.009 --> 20:25.259
What is it? What's wrong?

20:26.009 --> 20:29.519
I'm sure it's nothing.
But I'd like to withdraw...

20:30.210 --> 20:34.710
...a little amniotic fluid just to
make sure everything is shipshape.

20:36.210 --> 20:39.440
So, nurse, if you would prep
Mrs. Penborn right away?

21:05.089 --> 21:08.140
- Sarina?
- Just leave it outside.

21:08.690 --> 21:12.339
Sarina, it's Angel,
Cordelia's friend.  Can I come in?

21:14.089 --> 21:15.279
Okay.

21:25.490 --> 21:26.650
Sarina?

21:42.890 --> 21:44.049
Sarina?

21:50.089 --> 21:52.259
The light hurts my eyes lately.

21:53.089 --> 21:56.210
- I know the feeling.
- I thought you were the liquor store.

21:57.289 --> 21:58.900
I'm almost dry.

22:02.690 --> 22:05.460
I know what you're thinking.
I shouldn't, right?

22:06.890 --> 22:08.500
It'll hurt the baby?

22:11.690 --> 22:12.849
I hope.

22:15.289 --> 22:18.519
There's a O.5% chance
of miscarriage from the procedure.

22:18.890 --> 22:21.519
- Now, it's a very small risk--
- I'll take it.

22:24.890 --> 22:28.750
You'll feel a pinch.  Count backwards
from five and we'll be done.

22:29.089 --> 22:31.299
Five, four...

22:32.690 --> 22:36.130
...three, two, one.

22:36.890 --> 22:38.150
One.

22:39.289 --> 22:40.549
One.

22:41.089 --> 22:42.420
One!

22:44.089 --> 22:44.960
All done.

22:45.890 --> 22:49.400
That wasn't too bad, was it?
Now, we'll just run a few tests--

22:50.089 --> 22:51.140
Dr. Wasserman?

22:56.089 --> 22:57.140
This is....

23:00.289 --> 23:01.730
Excuse me.

23:08.089 --> 23:09.740
You saw what's inside of me?

23:12.289 --> 23:16.119
- I think we should find Angel.
- Wesley, please just tell me!

23:17.690 --> 23:19.269
Do they look healthy?

23:25.170 --> 23:28.539
It's like it's not real.
But it is.  Right?

23:29.970 --> 23:31.549
It's really happening?

23:32.369 --> 23:34.970
It's real.  It's happening
to Cordelia too.

23:35.970 --> 23:37.480
Oh, God.

23:38.369 --> 23:41.069
I can't reach Jason.  He's gone.

23:41.970 --> 23:43.650
So is Wilson.

23:44.369 --> 23:47.880
- I didn't know this would happen.
- But you knew something.

23:48.569 --> 23:51.980
I knew the guys, Jason and Nick...

23:52.769 --> 23:56.950
...and then Wilson wanted
to meet Cordelia.  I don't know.

23:59.369 --> 24:01.970
I knew something wasn't right.
Their money....

24:04.769 --> 24:07.299
- What about their money?
- It's stupid.

24:08.369 --> 24:10.690
It kind of smelled.

24:13.769 --> 24:15.799
I mean, really smelled.

24:16.170 --> 24:20.740
Sometimes the guys were like jumpy.
But this town-- You know.

24:21.569 --> 24:25.609
Everything's fake.  Things are weird
and you stop asking questions.

24:28.769 --> 24:30.660
You sure this is happening?

24:32.369 --> 24:34.440
Do you have someone you can call?

24:35.369 --> 24:36.839
- Like who?
- Family.

24:38.970 --> 24:42.759
No.  No one.  The guys seemed
like they liked that.

24:43.769 --> 24:47.700
Wilson asked about Cordelia.  I said
she didn't have anyone either.

24:48.569 --> 24:50.359
Sarina, where can I find--

24:58.250 --> 25:01.230
It'll all work out.
Everything's going to be fine.

25:02.450 --> 25:05.190
- I know it will be.
- There's a brave girl.

25:06.049 --> 25:09.000
I'm sure Angel won't mind
if you rest in here.

25:10.250 --> 25:13.160
Just relax, get comfortable.

25:13.250 --> 25:17.430
Well, as comfortable
as is possible, at any rate.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.740
Should you need anything,
anything at all...

25:22.849 --> 25:24.809
- ...then I'll just--
- You're afraid.

25:27.650 --> 25:31.130
- What?
- You're afraid of what's inside of me.

25:31.849 --> 25:33.319
You think it's horrible.

25:34.250 --> 25:36.180
You think I won't be
able to handle it.

25:36.650 --> 25:38.970
That if I find out,
I'll do something bad.

25:40.250 --> 25:43.509
Cordelia, the truth is
I haven't yet formulated a theory.

25:44.450 --> 25:47.119
I need time to analyze
the ultrasound...

25:48.049 --> 25:50.190
...and weigh the data.
When there's anything--

25:51.049 --> 25:52.059
There's seven of them.

25:53.450 --> 25:55.589
There's seven of his children...

25:56.450 --> 25:57.710
...growing inside of me.

26:00.650 --> 26:02.119
They're talking to me.

26:03.049 --> 26:06.279
They're talking all at once.
I can't understand.

26:06.650 --> 26:09.250
I know how difficult
this must be for you--

26:10.250 --> 26:11.480
No!

26:12.049 --> 26:13.589
- You don't know.
- All right.

26:13.849 --> 26:17.039
You don't know what it's like
to be a partner in creation.

26:17.450 --> 26:18.500
I just meant--

26:20.450 --> 26:22.170
- Wesley.
- Yes?

26:25.849 --> 26:27.529
They're not human.

26:29.450 --> 26:33.519
- I imagine that's true.
- But, that could be okay, right?

26:35.450 --> 26:38.960
I mean, look at Angel.
He's not human.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.849
And Doyle, he wasn't either.

26:44.450 --> 26:45.779
I mean, not totally.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.089
He was good.

27:14.450 --> 27:16.839
- Any luck locating Wilson?
- Not yet.

27:17.450 --> 27:20.119
But I did find Sarina.
She's a victim too.

27:21.049 --> 27:24.099
As big as Cordelia.
Wilson's rich pals are in on it.

27:24.650 --> 27:27.700
- Who knows how many are pregnant?
- It's worse.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.970
The ultrasound results.

27:30.650 --> 27:33.740
Seven heartbeats, maybe more.
With multiple pregnancies--

27:34.250 --> 27:36.250
- Someone's raising an army.
- Of what?

27:36.650 --> 27:38.609
We need to find the demon fathers.

27:39.650 --> 27:43.160
Gun clubs?  Guns can kill them?
I say, that makes it easier.

27:43.849 --> 27:47.920
Sarina said they hang out at some
private gun club, Guns and Cigars.

27:48.650 --> 27:52.410
Find the species and we may find a way
to terminate this without hurting her.

27:54.049 --> 27:55.170
And if we can't?

27:57.049 --> 27:59.259
Find out what to do once they're born.

28:00.650 --> 28:02.930
Yes, well, it mustn't come to that.

28:03.650 --> 28:05.900
The odds of her even surviving are--

28:14.450 --> 28:18.490
I never realized just how disgusting
that was.  Get her back to bed.

28:19.250 --> 28:22.019
And maybe order her a pizza
or something.

28:23.450 --> 28:24.430
Good idea.

28:35.450 --> 28:36.779
I was hungry.

28:49.890 --> 28:53.329
Shouldn't sneak up like that in here.
Accidents happen.

28:54.089 --> 28:57.349
Speaking of accidents,
I'm a friend of Cordelia Chase.

28:58.289 --> 29:01.339
This is a private club.
Featured word:  "Private."

29:01.890 --> 29:05.579
You don't talk to me, I'll kick
your ass.  Featured word:  "Ass."

29:06.089 --> 29:10.339
Angel, right?  Her boss?
She told me all about you.

29:12.089 --> 29:14.299
Somehow, I doubt that.

29:18.690 --> 29:21.640
You're human.
Then you can't be the father.

29:22.289 --> 29:24.430
You and your friends are just a link.

29:24.690 --> 29:28.970
How does it work?  Those things come
to term, she'll die, you know that?

29:30.089 --> 29:34.059
- So?  I'm not telling you anything.
- I was so hoping you'd say that.

29:42.089 --> 29:46.549
Hey!  Someone's mommy
didn't teach him to play nice.

29:47.490 --> 29:50.230
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

29:58.890 --> 30:00.500
Yeesh.

30:08.490 --> 30:09.720
That's him, isn't it?

30:11.490 --> 30:14.400
I'd ask that you not overreact.

30:15.089 --> 30:17.480
Keep in mind that oft times...

30:17.490 --> 30:20.930
...these 16th-century engravers
tended to exaggerate.

30:25.289 --> 30:28.519
It seems dire, but now that
we've identified the species...

30:29.490 --> 30:32.650
...there's every chance we'll
stop what's happening to you.

30:33.690 --> 30:36.460
That's right.  We mustn't lose hope.

30:40.289 --> 30:41.829
You won't hurt my babies.

30:46.289 --> 30:48.569
No one's gonna hurt my babies.

30:51.690 --> 30:53.480
I'm getting the big picture.

30:54.089 --> 30:58.369
You proxy for Big Daddy Demon.  You
implant his life force in these women.

30:58.890 --> 31:02.329
He has trouble finding dates.
We just help him out a little.

31:03.089 --> 31:06.849
- Shut up, Jason.
- You get money and success in return.

31:07.289 --> 31:09.750
How else would losers
like you get ahead?

31:10.289 --> 31:13.029
You'd have to become surrogates
for a vile demon.

31:13.890 --> 31:15.849
Well, mostly, I do it for the sex.

31:16.289 --> 31:19.339
Welcome to L.A.  There are worse
things to be in business with.

31:19.890 --> 31:22.240
Where is this demon you worship?

31:22.890 --> 31:27.099
Even if we told, it wouldn't matter
since you're gonna have an accident.

31:37.289 --> 31:39.849
I really don't like it
when people shoot me.

32:09.089 --> 32:11.369
Now you'll tell me
what I need to know.

33:27.690 --> 33:30.150
- Hello?
- Yeah, Wesley, it's Angel.

33:30.690 --> 33:32.200
- Thank God.
- I found Wilson,

33:32.490 --> 33:35.089
What Cordelia's carrying,
he's not the father.

33:36.089 --> 33:39.279
I know.  It's a Hacksaw beast,
an inner-earth demon.

33:39.690 --> 33:41.579
Oh, this is all my fault,

33:42.690 --> 33:45.779
- How's that your fault?
- She ran off.  I tried to stop her.

33:46.289 --> 33:50.680
She became insanely protective
when I identified the father of her--

33:53.490 --> 33:57.670
- I fear she may have gone to meet it.
- She has.  Miliken Industrial Park.

33:58.890 --> 34:01.839
- That's where its shrine is.
- How does Cordelia know?

34:02.490 --> 34:05.539
She's telepathically controlled
by it through its unborn,

34:06.089 --> 34:07.769
A psychic umbilical cord,

34:07.890 --> 34:10.800
The Hacksaw's telepathy's
sustaining its unborn spawn.

34:11.489 --> 34:13.000
We have to cut the cord.

34:13.289 --> 34:16.768
We slay this demon and poof!
No more evil pregnancies.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.929
Good, we can end this
without harming the women.

34:21.690 --> 34:24.179
- There's just one tiny problem.
- What's that?

34:24.690 --> 34:27.780
I don't wish to use the words
"impossible to kill"...

34:28.289 --> 34:30.780
...but fire won't kill it,
decapitation won't...

34:33.090 --> 34:34.809
...and it's really huge.

34:37.289 --> 34:40.409
- Wesley, can you shoot straight?
- Beg your pardon?

35:19.090 --> 35:20.489
Cordelia.

35:24.489 --> 35:28.070
Come out of there this instant.
All of you, please.

35:28.690 --> 35:32.409
- We don't expect you to understand.
- I understand.

35:35.889 --> 35:37.849
You'll die unless you come with me.

35:38.889 --> 35:42.789
That's the vilest smell I've ever had
the displeasure of inhaling.

35:43.090 --> 35:45.929
- Don't make me come after you.
- We serve our master.

35:46.690 --> 35:48.230
Please come before--

36:06.489 --> 36:08.590
Who is the interloper?

36:09.489 --> 36:12.789
To think you could disturb
the birth of my children?

36:13.090 --> 36:14.739
Who are you?

36:15.489 --> 36:19.039
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,
rogue demon hunter.

36:19.690 --> 36:22.179
I'm here to fight you, sir,
to the death.

36:23.289 --> 36:25.110
Preferably yours.

36:26.289 --> 36:27.159
You?

36:27.489 --> 36:31.210
As a heathen you don't know the
biblical story of David and Goliath.

36:32.289 --> 36:35.659
I assure you it's particularly
relevant to this situation.

36:35.889 --> 36:39.789
You said you came here to do battle.
Then let's fight and be done.

36:40.690 --> 36:42.579
Yes, well...

36:43.690 --> 36:45.199
...as a point of courtesy...

36:45.489 --> 36:47.699
...I like to get to know
my opponents...

36:48.489 --> 36:50.809
...before I engage them
in mortal combat.

36:55.090 --> 36:56.599
Do you have any hobbies?

36:56.889 --> 36:59.280
Enough talk.  I'll come to you.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.599
Sorry I'm late to the baby shower.
Brought a gift.

38:08.889 --> 38:10.780
I really hate dating.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.809
I got magazines for
when she comes back.

38:21.929 --> 38:24.840
Excuse me, I did just neaten
this up for her.

38:27.329 --> 38:29.500
Cordelia.  Hi.  You look great.

38:30.929 --> 38:33.489
- Marvelous!
- You didn't have to come in so soon.

38:33.929 --> 38:37.340
If you need more time, he can manage.
I've helped out a bit--

38:39.329 --> 38:41.719
Someone forgot to close
the filter again.

38:42.329 --> 38:45.099
- If you're ready to come back....
- I'm fine.

38:45.929 --> 38:48.980
I had a great audition
for Max Crax, the crackers.

38:49.530 --> 38:52.369
Terrific.  Because a cracker's
something everyone can--

38:52.530 --> 38:53.400
- Eat.
- Eat.

38:53.730 --> 38:56.989
This producer is so nice.
He said I'm his first choice.

38:57.929 --> 38:59.510
We're having dinner tonight.

39:01.530 --> 39:02.400
Tonight?

39:05.130 --> 39:06.949
Best to get back on the horse.
If he seems--

39:06.929 --> 39:10.369
He is so sweet.  All I have to do
is let him impregnate me...

39:11.130 --> 39:13.300
...with his demon seed
and I've got the part.

39:16.530 --> 39:19.579
Guys, I appreciate all the concern,
but I'm okay.

39:20.130 --> 39:21.739
I got through the ordeal.

39:22.530 --> 39:26.079
I'm a lot stronger than those
loser demon surrogates thought.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.380
I'm starting to learn that.

39:29.130 --> 39:30.809
I learned something too.

39:32.130 --> 39:34.760
I learned men are evil.
Wait...

39:35.130 --> 39:36.000
...I knew that.

39:36.929 --> 39:39.420
I learned that L.A. is full of
self-serving phonies.

39:39.929 --> 39:42.210
No, had that one down too.

39:42.929 --> 39:44.789
- Sex is bad?
- We all knew that.

39:45.329 --> 39:47.789
Okay.  I learned that
I have two people...

39:48.329 --> 39:50.719
...I trust absolutely with my life.

39:53.130 --> 39:54.739
And that part's new.

40:01.530 --> 40:02.400
Some...

40:02.730 --> 40:04.030
...allergies.

40:05.305 --> 40:11.876
