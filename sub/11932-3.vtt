WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:05.919
We took the coastal road, then came in
on the bypass to avoid the traffic.

00:05.960 --> 00:09.720
Did it in record time.
Phwoar! Three days, door to door!

00:09.759 --> 00:13.640
Oh, I'm so excited to finally see
where you live.

00:17.199 --> 00:21.399
Well, it's certainly got character.
I did ask Grumio to tidy up.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.640
I didn't want to spoil the character.
I'll do it. I brought my pinny.

00:24.679 --> 00:27.760
And give me any dirty undies to
wash.  Oh, Mum, please.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.679
How much do you pay for this place?
Not much.  250 a month.

00:30.719 --> 00:34.079
250? You could rent a whole village
for that.

00:34.119 --> 00:37.039
Now, then! Pressie time.
Ooh!

00:37.079 --> 00:42.280
I've got tunics for everyone
and I've got a cardy for Stylax.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.719
Hat for Grumio.
Are all the presents knitted?

00:44.759 --> 00:47.799
There's damp here, look. You should
speak to your landlord.  Yeah.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.399
And a briefcase for you, Marcus. Yow!
This is wicked, Sylvia. Thank you.

00:53.439 --> 00:56.119
Ah! There. That's cosy, isn't it?

00:56.159 --> 00:58.280
Ooh! Right, I'll get started
on the kitchen.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.399
Oh, no, you don't do...
Are these clean or...?

01:00.439 --> 01:01.880
(SNIFFS)

01:01.920 --> 01:03.600
No.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.680
# When in Rome
Do as the Romans do

01:13.120 --> 01:15.560
# Far from home

01:15.599 --> 01:18.239
â™ª All I got is you... â™ª

01:23.920 --> 01:26.560
This is some sort of big Roman
palaver.

01:26.599 --> 01:29.840
Oh, how exciting. Tell me everything
you know.

01:29.879 --> 01:31.599
That's about it, actually.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.479
It's the parade of the Vestal
virgins.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.120
Not too late for you to join, eh,
Marcus?

01:36.159 --> 01:37.924
Hilarious, Dad.
Oh, stop it.

01:38.125 --> 01:41.719
I bet the girls are queuing up for him,
right, Marcus?

01:41.759 --> 01:43.599
Well, yeah, not exactly.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.479
So have you got a girlfriend, then?

01:45.520 --> 01:46.879
Er, well...

01:46.920 --> 01:50.200
He's got one. Lepidus, look - he's
got one.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.079
So who is she? When can we meet her?

01:53.079 --> 01:55.479
No, I don't... I don't have a
girlfriend. Sorry.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.120
Oh. You will one day, soldier.

01:58.159 --> 02:02.120
Another honey sandwich, Grumio?
Yeah. Keep them coming, Sylv.

02:02.159 --> 02:05.159
Eh, why didn't you tell her about
your girlfriend?  Why do you think?

02:05.200 --> 02:09.680
I can't expose Delphine to that shit
storm. What? Your parents are wicked.

02:09.719 --> 02:13.599
No. Mum would smother her with wool
and Delphine's so bloody fiery

02:13.639 --> 02:15.919
there'd be some terrible knitwear
inferno.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.479
Oh! Here come the virgins.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.639
Salve, ladies.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.199
What are you doing?
My sexy face.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.801
Not sure your sexy face
will work on this lot.

02:26.002 --> 02:27.879
My sexy face works on every lot.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.439
Hello!  Hi.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.520
As if. It was probably just a
twitch.

02:38.560 --> 02:42.079
Uh-uh. It was a cheeky little
wink from a smoking hot Vestal.

02:42.120 --> 02:46.439
She's not going to wink at shrub-haired
wally boy in his granddad's cardy.

02:46.479 --> 02:48.199
I know when I've been winked at,
mate.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.479
Now I just need to work out how to
get my winky into that winker.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.000
You keep your winky away from her.
She's a Vestal Virgin.

02:54.039 --> 02:55.920
Maybe I'm up for a bit of
vestiality.

02:55.960 --> 02:59.719
Oh, well, that's disgusting
and illegal.  Vestiality - with a V.

02:59.759 --> 03:03.240
Yes, that's illegal too. There are
half a million women in this city

03:03.280 --> 03:06.637
and only six of them with whom sexual
relations are specifically forbidden.

03:06.836 --> 03:07.879
Please just forget it.

03:07.919 --> 03:11.400
Nobody winks at Stylax Urastaques
and gets away with it.

03:11.439 --> 03:12.759
Nobody.

03:14.120 --> 03:18.719
20 sesterces for an apple? An apple?

03:18.759 --> 03:21.840
This city's out of control.
I don't know how you manage.

03:21.879 --> 03:24.360
Something usually turns up if you
know where to look.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.920
Grumio, I found a lump of cheese
under your bed.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.800
There you go.
It was wrapped in a soggy towel.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.520
Eh, eh, eh. What are you doing?

03:33.560 --> 03:36.199
I'm throwing it out. It's covered in
mould. Look.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.360
I'll have it. It's just a bit blue.
At least cut the blue bit off, then.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.240
Oh, dear.  Oh.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.240
(RETCHES)

03:54.280 --> 03:56.319
Oh! Hang about.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.840
Mmm.

04:01.599 --> 04:04.639
Marcus!
Delphine! Hey.

04:05.800 --> 04:10.280
Wow! You finally got a nice tunic.
It looks good on you.

04:10.319 --> 04:15.919
Oh. Yeah, it's... Erm... An original
piece by a rural artisan friend.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.040
Mm.  What are you doing here?
I came into town for a haircut.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.879
I thought we could have dinner.
Oh, yeah. It looks great.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.720
I've not had it yet, dickhead.
I meant afterwards.

04:24.759 --> 04:26.319
Sure, yes, sorry.

04:26.360 --> 04:30.560
Erm, I would love to but I'm really
not feeling well.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.560
Really? You look fine.

04:32.600 --> 04:37.360
I know. You'd have to feel my other
end. It's chock full of germs.

04:37.399 --> 04:38.639
OK. I'm not doing that.

04:38.680 --> 04:42.360
But I can tuck you in later on
if you want.  No, best not.

04:42.399 --> 04:47.040
The germs in question are all over
the flat and very contagious.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.120
I'll come to yours as soon as
they're gone,

04:49.159 --> 04:51.639
probably around eight o'clock
tomorrow night?

04:51.680 --> 04:55.959
That's very precise.
Well, I know my body.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.959
The blessings of Vesta.

05:06.759 --> 05:08.920
The blessings of Vesta.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.040
The blessings of Vesta.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.240
The blessings of... Oh, hi.

05:17.279 --> 05:21.240
Erm, I'm usually served by the young
sultry one,

05:21.279 --> 05:23.160
with the cheekbones and the...

05:23.199 --> 05:25.920
Ursula is busy now.
Oh, that's fine. I can wait.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.800
And it doesn't matter who serves you.
You get the same fire.

05:28.839 --> 05:30.680
Yeah, I know, I... I just prefer her
fire.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.120
It feels a bit hotter.

05:33.159 --> 05:35.480
Well... Thank you.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.120
Ahem.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.680
Hi. Ursula, is it? I'm Stylax.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.680
You might remember me from this
morning in the crowd. You winked.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.840
I think. Or blinked.

05:52.879 --> 05:55.519
Or... It was a twitch, wasn't it?

05:55.560 --> 05:58.040
Oh, I'm sorry. I just...

05:58.079 --> 06:01.639
Come back this evening.
I'll be guarding the flame.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.560
Alone.

06:04.959 --> 06:07.000
Mind your fingers, by the way.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.480
Oh!

06:14.360 --> 06:17.560
(FRENCH ACCENT) You bought this
here?  Yeah. And now it's all mouldy.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.360
I don't do refunds. I'm sorry.
No, I'm not complaining.

06:21.399 --> 06:24.319
The mould tastes bloody lovely.
Try it.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.519
It's surprisingly delicious, I
assure you.

06:33.319 --> 06:35.480
Oh, sh...  Stay with it.

06:35.519 --> 06:37.480
Stay with it.

06:37.519 --> 06:39.360
Ah?  Ah?

06:39.399 --> 06:42.040
Right, you see?
Ah! I love it.

06:42.079 --> 06:44.560
How did you make this?
Trade secret, I'm afraid.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.079
If you supply the cheese,
he can make plenty more -

06:47.120 --> 06:49.439
split the profits - what do you say?
OK.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.079
And how do we call it?
I'm calling it blue.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.759
Nah. I think we should call it bleu.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.879
Personally, I prefer blue.
I much prefer bleu.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.079
Mm. Blue.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.920
Ah. Bleu.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.079
Bleurgh it is, then.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.399
(CHUCKLES)

07:11.079 --> 07:12.309
Have a nice evening, guys.

07:12.509 --> 07:15.439
Are you not coming for dinner?
I'd love to but I've made plans.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.759
I'm going to the temple.
Temple? Really?

07:17.800 --> 07:20.759
I didn't know you'd found religion,
Stylax.  Neither did I.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.360
Well, that parade got me all fired up.
I think I'm going to check it out.

07:24.399 --> 07:26.959
Well, I'm very impressed.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.759
Oh, don't forget your cardy. Oh, yeah.
Wouldn't want to catch a cold.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.360
Mm.

07:33.399 --> 07:39.399
Oh. And to think that's the boy who
used to stick raisins up his willy.

07:39.439 --> 07:43.840
So, Ursula, what's it like,
being a Vestal Virgin?

07:43.879 --> 07:47.240
Total sack of shit, mate.
Every day the same.

07:47.279 --> 07:50.000
You get up, you watch the flame,
you tend the flame,

07:50.040 --> 07:51.360
you take the flame for a walk.

07:51.399 --> 07:54.319
Yeah, but you're really famous.
I mean, that must be wicked.

07:54.360 --> 07:58.480
Is it fuck?  No?  People think being
in the V's is all glamour, right?

07:58.519 --> 08:02.959
But it's like a prison. I've never
left Rome. I've never climbed a tree,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.600
never been out for a greasy kebab.

08:04.639 --> 08:06.759
No - you would regret a greasy
kebab.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.600
I would love to regret a greasy
kebab.

08:08.639 --> 08:10.759
So why did you join, then?
Same as everyone.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.120
I was eight years old. I liked the
hats.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.600
They are nice hats.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.800
So, you want to shag me in the
cloister or what?

08:19.839 --> 08:23.480
Er, I'm happy to do it in the
vagina, like normal.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.839
That room there.  Oh, right!

08:27.680 --> 08:28.959
Yes, please.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.759
Well, erm, I don't think we need
a starter.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.221
Shall we go straight to the mains?

08:34.422 --> 08:36.679
Let them have a starter if
they want one. We do, yeah.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.480
Can we have a table for two, please?

08:38.519 --> 08:42.600
Actually, I can't eat anything here.
Maybe let's go somewhere else.

08:42.639 --> 08:45.720
What?  Yeah. Somewhere a bit cheaper.
Eh, Dad? Oh, yes, all right.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.720
No, there's plenty you can eat.
You like chicken, you like lamb,

08:48.759 --> 08:51.360
fish if I take out the bones. You
might like lobster.

08:51.399 --> 08:55.000
He might not. He might prefer
the soup or the omelette or...

08:55.039 --> 08:56.960
Marcus what are you doing down
there?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.360
All right, Delphine?
No! Grumio!

08:59.399 --> 09:03.120
Hi, Grumio. Is that Marcus under
there by any chance?

09:03.159 --> 09:05.559
(SIMPERS) Er, found it.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.639
Found that pea I was looking for.

09:08.879 --> 09:11.559
Oh! Hi, Delphine.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.120
Fancy seeing you here.

09:13.159 --> 09:15.919
Feeling better, then?  Er, yes,
thanks.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.879
Er, turns out I don't know my body
after all. Hmm.

09:18.919 --> 09:21.159
So do you two know each other, then?

09:23.399 --> 09:26.720
Yes. Erm... Delphine's my

09:26.759 --> 09:29.559
girlfriend. What? You didn't have one
this morning.

09:29.600 --> 09:35.000
Busy afternoon. Er, no. We've actually
been together for a while.

09:35.039 --> 09:39.879
So why didn't you say anything?
And is this man involved?

09:39.919 --> 09:42.720
No. I... I don't know who that is.

09:42.759 --> 09:45.480
Oscar. Hi.  Hi.

09:45.519 --> 09:47.279
Oscar is my hairdresser.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.360
Seeing as you were ill, I was at a
loose end.

09:50.399 --> 09:53.000
Right. Your hair looks great, by the
way. Oh! Thanks.

09:53.039 --> 09:56.600
Well, why don't you join us? We'll
push the two tables together.

09:56.639 --> 10:01.440
Thank you but I think Marcus prefers
to keep things separate.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.039
# I'm in the mood for love

10:14.559 --> 10:17.720
Are you sure you're a virgin? Cos you
seem to know what you're doing. Sh!

10:22.399 --> 10:25.559
What was that?  Oh, nothing. The
flame just went out.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.120
What?

10:27.159 --> 10:30.840
The sacred flame went out.
Mm. Is that going to be a problem?

10:30.879 --> 10:34.480
The flame's gone out!
The sacred flame's gone out!

10:34.519 --> 10:36.720
(BELL RINGS)
The flame's gone out!

10:36.759 --> 10:38.360
The sacred flame's gone out!

10:38.399 --> 10:41.360
Er... What do we do now?

10:41.399 --> 10:43.000
The window. Quickly.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.480
Oh, shit - my cardy.  Leave it!
It was a present.

10:47.519 --> 10:49.600
Leave the fucking cardy!  OK.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.159
This way, centurion.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.679
Have you just got back?
Oh, hey.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.320
Er, what are you doing in here?
I gave my parents my bed.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.240
So how was temple? Yeah, good.

11:18.279 --> 11:20.159
Yeah. How was dinner?  Hideous.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.600
Delphine was eating in the same
bloody restaurant. Phoof!

11:24.879 --> 11:27.960
My bedroom's just over there.
Er, where's the toilet?  Here.

11:29.639 --> 11:32.320
Shit! So Delphine must have been
pretty angry, right?

11:32.360 --> 11:35.279
Is...? Who was that? That's
Ursula, yeah.  The Vestal Virgin?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.519
Well, she's technically just a
Vestal now.

11:37.559 --> 11:39.440
Ah! And why is she in our flat?

11:39.480 --> 11:42.398
Well, there was a kerfuffle with
some wine and the flame going out,

11:42.597 --> 11:43.879
which apparently is a no-no.

11:43.919 --> 11:47.039
You put out the sacred flame
and brought a Vestal to our flat?

11:47.080 --> 11:50.159
And lost the cardigan your mum gave
me. Bit of a triple whammy.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.799
Well, go back and get it, then,
before they trace it to us.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.799
What's all the shouting about?
Stylax humped a Vestal Virgin.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.600
She's technically just a Vestal now.

11:57.639 --> 11:59.639
Oh. Boom.  Yeah.

11:59.679 --> 12:02.519
No - not boom. Not boom at all.

12:02.559 --> 12:06.159
Your toilet's full of cheese.
Yeah, I know. Just work around it.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.919
Why is the toilet full of cheese?
I'm harvesting blue.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.360
What? Sorry. I should say,
I'm harvesting bleu.

12:14.399 --> 12:17.960
That's no clearer, Grumio. I'm making
mouldy cheese to sell down the market.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.105
Oh, good! So you're hiding
a runaway nun

12:20.304 --> 12:23.759
and you're cultivating putrid
cheese while my parents are here.

12:23.799 --> 12:25.596
Yeah. Anything else
you want to throw in?

12:25.796 --> 12:28.399
Smear the wall with faeces?
Fill the kitchen with snakes?

12:31.200 --> 12:35.279
Toast's done. I cut it into corners,
just how you like it.

12:35.320 --> 12:38.600
Old school.  I'm sure I've seen you
somewhere before, Ursula.

12:38.639 --> 12:40.720
Do you work in arable farming, by
any chance?

12:40.759 --> 12:44.759
Er, no, I'm in between jobs at the
moment.

12:44.799 --> 12:48.240
And where did you two meet?
Actually, we met at the temple.

12:48.279 --> 12:51.080
Oh, lovely! Have you been together
long?  No, not long.

12:51.120 --> 12:55.360
And you still introduce us and we're
not even your parents.

12:55.399 --> 12:58.679
Marcus doesn't even...  I said I was
sorry. It was so embarrassing.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.360
Honestly, that poor girl.
I know, Mum. I'm going to apologise.

13:02.399 --> 13:05.559
Good. Do you want me to come?
No! Of course not.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.320
I'm a grown-up man. I can deal with
it. Yes!

13:08.360 --> 13:10.279
Oh, you've got jam face.

13:14.440 --> 13:18.240
I'm sorry. It's not you, it's my
parents, honestly.

13:18.279 --> 13:22.759
Boff.  No, not boff. I was just
worried you wouldn't get on.

13:22.799 --> 13:25.080
Why wouldn't we get on?
Because they're annoying

13:25.120 --> 13:27.639
and you can be, well, quite...
Quite what?

13:27.679 --> 13:30.879
Quite fucking what?
Well, yeah, like this. Aggro.

13:30.919 --> 13:34.080
I thought you were apologising.
No, I am. I'm sorry.

13:34.120 --> 13:40.279
Look - I got you this. It's a hand-made
handbag from my artisan friend.

13:42.159 --> 13:44.919
Thank you. It's really nice.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.519
Hmm.

13:46.559 --> 13:49.440
Oh, you wrote me a note.
Oh! Erm...

13:49.480 --> 13:51.759
"For my little soldier."

13:51.799 --> 13:55.240
Yeah. That's my nickname for you.
No, it isn't.

13:55.279 --> 13:57.480
Just trying it out.

13:57.519 --> 14:00.200
"Love from Mum."

14:00.879 --> 14:04.840
Your nickname for me?
You're a cheap bastard, Marcus.

14:04.879 --> 14:06.919
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Look...

14:06.960 --> 14:09.960
I come from a long line of cheap
bastards.

14:20.279 --> 14:22.399
You all right, Landlady? What's
going on here?

14:22.440 --> 14:24.320
I'm just enjoying the show.

14:24.360 --> 14:29.159
Some Vestal slag was having a shag
and let the flame go out. Whorr!

14:29.200 --> 14:31.799
Yeah, I love all this celebrity sex
stuff, me.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.519
Do they who it was yet?
No, not yet, no.

14:34.559 --> 14:37.720
They're just getting the bricks
ready to wall 'em in with.  What?

14:37.759 --> 14:41.759
Wall them in? What does that mean? Well,
it's what it sounds like, numb-nuts.

14:41.799 --> 14:46.840
The pair of them, the perverts, gets
bricked up inside a wall until they die

14:46.879 --> 14:49.159
of hunger or thirst or both.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.440
Fucking brilliant.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.519
I've found his cardigan!
Ooh!

14:54.519 --> 14:56.399
She's found his cardy.

14:56.440 --> 15:00.039
Here - wall 'em in.
Wall 'em in!

15:00.080 --> 15:01.639
Wall 'em in.

15:01.679 --> 15:03.879
Wall 'em in!
Wall 'em in!

15:03.919 --> 15:06.720
Wall 'em in! Wall 'em in!

15:11.159 --> 15:12.960
Bingo.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.639
What's the matter,
my little soldier?

15:21.679 --> 15:25.120
You look ever so glum.
Oh, it's nothing.

15:25.159 --> 15:28.679
It's just that bloody bleu -
it's making me wince.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.720
Mm. It's more than just the bleu,
though, isn't it?

15:31.759 --> 15:34.320
There's something else.
Er...

15:34.360 --> 15:37.279
I think I've really pissed off
Delphine. Now, swearing.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.840
You can win her round
if you like her.

15:39.879 --> 15:43.000
Do you like her?
Well... I think...

15:43.039 --> 15:45.279
I think I might love her.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.000
But I've really fucked up.
Well, then - swearing again -

15:48.039 --> 15:49.519
what are we going to do about it?

15:49.559 --> 15:51.879
I don't know.

15:51.919 --> 15:53.399
What do you mean, "we"?

15:53.440 --> 15:56.080
Mum, please. This is not a good idea.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.519
Oh, because you're doing such a
marvellous job on your own? Fair point.

16:02.879 --> 16:06.360
Is this where she lives?
This isn't a normal house.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.519
Yeah, it's a sort of squat.

16:08.559 --> 16:13.000
Delphine, hello!
What a lovely squat.

16:13.039 --> 16:16.279
It's got such character.
Hello, Mrs Gallow.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.639
Call me Sylvia, please.
What do you want, Marcus?

16:19.679 --> 16:22.559
Now, it's not for me to meddle
but I want you to know

16:22.600 --> 16:27.000
that however badly he's behaved, he's
a good boy at heart and he means well.

16:27.039 --> 16:29.720
Mum. Well, you are. I want her to
know that.

16:29.759 --> 16:33.480
And do you know this good boy tried
to give me the bag you made him?

16:33.519 --> 16:37.159
What, the briefcase? Yeah, well,
it's more of a ladies' handbag, Mum.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.000
If you didn't like it, you should
have said.  Yeah, I'm sorry.

16:40.039 --> 16:43.120
It took me days to knit that. It's a
very complicated pattern.

16:45.240 --> 16:49.080
That aside, I still think you should
give him another chance, Delphine.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.919
To be honest, the only reason he's
being such an idiot

16:51.960 --> 16:54.399
is because he thinks he might love
you.  Oh, Mum!

16:54.440 --> 16:56.759
What are you doing? Well, you do. You
said you did.

16:56.799 --> 16:58.440
Well... Did you?

16:58.480 --> 17:02.519
Er... Go on - say it to her face.
Yeah, well, not now.

17:02.559 --> 17:04.358
Not with my mother here telling me
to.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.759
Oh, he's gone all shy. Look!

17:07.799 --> 17:10.720
You should probably take him home.
Yeah.

17:10.759 --> 17:12.559
Very nice to meet you all.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.880
Briefly.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.559
Come on.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.799
And...

17:23.519 --> 17:27.400
I don't know how to tell you this but
if they catch us, they're going to...

17:27.440 --> 17:29.680
wall us in.
Yeah, I know.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.519
You know? Why didn't you tell me?

17:32.559 --> 17:34.000
It didn't really come up, did it?

17:34.039 --> 17:35.386
You shouldn't sleep with a girl

17:35.586 --> 17:37.759
unless you're ready to deal
with the consequences.

17:37.799 --> 17:40.359
Oh, these are some spicy
consequences.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.200
Only because you put the flame out.
It's never happened before.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.759
What do you mean, before?
Ah! So you weren't a virgin.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.480
Did I seem like a virgin?  No. Not
really.

17:48.519 --> 17:50.799
Your title was a bit misleading.
Yeah, well.

17:50.839 --> 17:53.240
What shall we do?  Well, we need
to come up with a plan.

17:56.079 --> 17:57.340
Shall we have sex again?

17:57.540 --> 18:00.640
Er, not the sort of plan I was
thinking but, yeah, why not?

18:00.680 --> 18:03.839
The damage has been done. Yeah.
You can't get walled in twice, eh?

18:05.960 --> 18:07.920
Good boy. This way.

18:10.079 --> 18:13.599
So, how's it going with the bleu?
Oh, magnifique.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.079
It is maybe the best cheese
I've ever tasted.

18:16.119 --> 18:19.039
Well, I do my best.  But no-one will
buy it.

18:19.079 --> 18:22.240
What? Why not?
They say, "What is this bleu?

18:22.279 --> 18:25.319
I don't want to buy this stinky
cheese that's covered in mould."

18:25.359 --> 18:28.640
What about when they taste it?
They won't. They are too scared.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.480
So we're not going to make a packet?
Eh, Grumio,

18:31.519 --> 18:35.359
you cannot win the beauty contest
if no-one will look at your face.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.559
I'm not sure I'd win it, anyway.

18:37.599 --> 18:40.759
Now take it away, please. The smell
has been making me dizzy.

18:49.839 --> 18:52.200
Salve, Marcus.
All right, Landlord.

18:52.240 --> 18:56.920
Oh, you're the landlord? Lovely.
Sylvia Gallow, Marcus's mum.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.440
We're just visiting for the weekend.
Oh, are you, now?

18:59.480 --> 19:03.240
Staying here, are you? Yes. Actually, my
husband wanted to talk to you about rent.

19:03.279 --> 19:05.002
Well, exactly, cos guests is extra.

19:05.202 --> 19:07.960
I think he was after a discount.
I'll put it on the tab.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.839
(IMITATES HUNTING HORN)
Right! Let the hunt commence.

19:11.880 --> 19:16.440
What? What hunt? There's a reward for
this missing Vestal and her fella.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.799
I've rounded up a bit of a posse.
A Vestal's gone missing?

19:19.839 --> 19:22.200
Oh! But we saw them only yesterday.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.599
Popped her cherry then popped off,
apparently.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.519
Still, couldn't have gone far.
They're very eye-catching.

19:27.559 --> 19:29.920
Oh, well, good luck, then.
What do they look like?

19:29.960 --> 19:34.079
Well, she's a bit of a stunner
and he's an old gipper,

19:34.119 --> 19:36.480
judging by his dodgy cardigan that
he left behind.

19:36.519 --> 19:40.400
Ooh. Erm...
Yes, between extra rent and this reward,

19:40.440 --> 19:43.200
I think it's going to be a bumper
weekend for me.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.359
Come on, lads.
(CHEERING)

19:50.000 --> 19:54.359
I'm disappointed in you, Stylax. A
Vestal Virgin? I thought you'd grown up?

19:54.400 --> 19:56.920
And a bloody manhunt, Sylvia.
Don't forget the manhunt.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.720
This is very naughty, Stylax, even
for you.

19:59.759 --> 20:02.000
This is the naughtiest thing I've
done, to be fair.

20:02.039 --> 20:04.759
Why couldn't you just forget it?
This is a total disaster.

20:04.799 --> 20:06.960
Well, mostly for me.
I could get walled in.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.839
If they find her,
we'll all get walled in.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.880
Surely me and your mother won't get
walled in? What have we done?

20:11.920 --> 20:15.240
Let's just hide out here for a few
weeks until it blows over.

20:15.279 --> 20:18.119
Yes, like it. Let's chill out and
work our way through the bleu.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.640
I think I'd rather get walled in.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.200
We need to get her out of here.
I can't go out there!

20:23.240 --> 20:25.359
There's men with sniffer dogs
looking for me.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.440
Oh, bloody Nora.
Right, everybody, think.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.160
Lepidus, are you thinking?
I'm trying, dear. I'm trying.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.279
(KNOCKING)

20:36.039 --> 20:39.480
Fine. I forgive you.
Oh, great. Thank you. Do come in.

20:39.519 --> 20:44.640
But only because I like your mother.
Oh, well, I like you, too, Delphine.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.559
Ooh-lah-lah! What is that smell?

20:48.599 --> 20:51.240
It's bleu. You get used to it after
a couple of days.

20:51.279 --> 20:55.079
Ah. These are for you, Sylvia,
to say thank you for the bag.

20:55.119 --> 20:57.119
How lovely!

20:57.160 --> 21:00.480
Not that you'd be able to smell
anything with that cheese around.

21:00.519 --> 21:03.680
Oh! Amazing! I love you.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.880
Oh!  I've had an idea.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.759
Mum, Dad, I need to ask a bit of a
favour.

21:09.799 --> 21:12.079
Yes, anything, we'll do it.
How much will it cost?

21:16.640 --> 21:19.440
Er, sorry about this.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.359
Ach, it's better than being
walled in.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.440
Yeah, I guess you're sort of
cheesed in.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.799
So what are you going to do?
Dunno. Maybe do a bit of travelling.

21:27.839 --> 21:30.160
Finally eat that greasy kebab.
Oh!

21:31.200 --> 21:33.559
Shall I come with you?  No, it's all
right, babe.

21:33.599 --> 21:35.720
Once I'm out of the city, you're in
the clear.

21:35.759 --> 21:38.519
Oh, no, I meant more for sexy
reasons.  Oh.

21:38.559 --> 21:40.799
For a virgin, it was one hell of a
ride.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.160
Yeah, I can't breathe.
It's too cheesy.

21:51.359 --> 21:54.880
Well, it was so good to meet you,
Delphine - eventually.

21:54.920 --> 21:58.440
And do let me know your address,
sizes and favourite colour of wool.

22:06.119 --> 22:08.759
Hold it there, please. Just going to
check your cargo.

22:08.799 --> 22:11.839
Oh, yes, OK.
Good boy. Up you get.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.559
Phwarr. Bloody hell. Ugh!

22:14.599 --> 22:17.920
All right, that's clear. On you go.
Thank you very much.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.359
And we're in the clear.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.720
Salve, boys.
All right, Landlord.

22:24.759 --> 22:27.839
We got them - look.
Come on, then, you perverts.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.079
All right? Let's get 'em walled in.

22:31.119 --> 22:33.200
(CHEERING)

22:34.119 --> 22:36.799
# Uh-huh

22:37.839 --> 22:39.119
# Do it again

22:39.160 --> 22:42.160
# Ah

22:42.839 --> 22:44.240
# Hear me calling

22:44.279 --> 22:48.599
# I came, I saw, I conquered
I came, I saw, I conquered

22:48.640 --> 22:52.480
# I came, I saw, I conquered
Then I conquered you

22:52.519 --> 22:54.400
# You gotta believe me

22:54.440 --> 22:58.599
# I came, I saw, I conquered
I came, I saw, I conquered

22:58.640 --> 23:02.319
â™ª I came, I saw, I conquered
Then I conquered you. â™ª
