01:33.958 --> 01:35.000
Good night.

01:35.083 --> 01:35.916
Pump 1?

01:36.000 --> 01:36.833
Yes.

01:50.916 --> 01:51.916
Anything else?

01:57.166 --> 01:58.000
Goodnight.

03:00.916 --> 03:02.166
The road is long.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.541
But nobody said it was easy.

03:09.708 --> 03:13.166
At the end of this road
is everything that I need...

03:14.041 --> 03:15.666
When we don't have nothing...

03:16.208 --> 03:20.375
The littles someone gives...

03:23.500 --> 03:24.333
Peace.

03:25.625 --> 03:26.625
Freedom.

03:28.916 --> 03:29.916
Future.

03:33.583 --> 03:34.583
A life...

03:35.833 --> 03:37.208
A better life...

04:57.166 --> 04:58.208
Open the door.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.250
- Do you have a light?

06:00.541 --> 06:01.541
How's the family?

06:05.208 --> 06:07.291
I just saw your wife yesterday.

06:07.375 --> 06:08.375
What a lovely woman.

06:10.416 --> 06:12.083
Taking care of that
small, little house, hm.

06:18.875 --> 06:22.458
Are you not afraid to leave
her and that little girl alone

06:23.541 --> 06:25.500
for so many days?

06:25.583 --> 06:26.583
I would be.

06:37.416 --> 06:39.750
Keep calm, man, I like you.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.333
I like the man that puts
his family always first.

06:47.750 --> 06:48.750
I respect this.

06:57.916 --> 06:58.916
Well.

07:00.750 --> 07:01.750
This cargo is delivered.

07:03.916 --> 07:04.916
You did a good job.

07:08.666 --> 07:09.583
Antonio...

07:10.083 --> 07:11.083
Take your money.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.333
You can go now.

07:43.958 --> 07:44.958
Hey.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.333
Take the address
of the next cargo.

08:38.791 --> 08:40.166
Welcome...

08:41.207 --> 08:42.625
To your new life!

12:35.166 --> 12:36.708
Documents and passports!

12:38.458 --> 12:39.666
Why?

12:40.166 --> 12:41.375
Fast, I said!

12:42.916 --> 12:43.875
No!

13:21.416 --> 13:25.250
- Mama!

20:30.291 --> 20:31.125
Hello?

20:32.958 --> 20:35.666
- How are
you, my friend?

20:35.750 --> 20:39.583
You looked weird the
last time I saw you.

20:39.666 --> 20:40.500
Are you sick?

20:40.583 --> 20:42.333
- No.

20:42.416 --> 20:43.500
- If you're
not sick, Antonio

20:43.583 --> 20:44.416
we have a problem.

20:46.666 --> 20:49.916
I don't like when people
starts acting weird.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.291
I don't understand...

20:52.625 --> 20:55.541
- That you have
some fucking problem with me.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.625
Do you know what would
happen with me and Luisa

21:01.375 --> 21:03.458
if you stopped working for me?

21:04.791 --> 21:05.791
Just imagine.

21:07.625 --> 21:11.291
Your granddaughter and
your wife being fucked

21:11.375 --> 21:14.333
over and over and
fucking over again.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.041
Your wife, hm.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.125
She will like, yeah.

21:20.125 --> 21:24.291
Your granddaughter would grow
and become a fucking whore.

21:26.375 --> 21:27.833
Antonio, you
take everything so seriously.

21:27.916 --> 21:29.166
Antonio...

21:33.458 --> 21:36.291
I like you, I know
you are loyal.

21:38.708 --> 21:41.750
If you need something,
Antonio, just call me.

21:41.833 --> 21:42.666
I'm always here.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.166
Everywhere, Antonio, everywhere.

22:26.208 --> 22:27.208
- She'll be fine.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.083
Why didn't you helped her?

22:53.375 --> 22:54.625
Why?

22:57.250 --> 22:59.541
You know what
they will do to her.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.375
And none of you, whores,

23:05.458 --> 23:07.625
even tried to fight for her!

23:10.958 --> 23:12.833
All together
we could have fought!

23:13.083 --> 23:14.375
We could have run away!

23:14.458 --> 23:16.291
I'm disgusted with you!

23:16.541 --> 23:18.375
You worth nothing!

23:20.083 --> 23:21.291
Whores!

23:46.125 --> 23:47.875
Do you know how many people

23:49.625 --> 23:51.416
I saw dying in here?

23:53.125 --> 23:54.708
Too many.

23:56.958 --> 23:59.333
I've been here for months.

24:00.666 --> 24:04.166
Do you know how many people
were able to escape from here?

24:05.166 --> 24:06.250
None!

24:07.625 --> 24:09.541
You don't understand
where you are!

24:11.083 --> 24:13.416
It is better to stay here
than to die.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.250
They sent food and water.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.500
Drink!

25:16.416 --> 25:18.041
Why are we locked in here?

25:19.416 --> 25:20.250
I don't know.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.083
They didn't tell me....

26:03.416 --> 26:04.250
What happened?

26:05.291 --> 26:06.375
Is there any problem?

26:07.083 --> 26:07.916
It's nothing.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.291
I didn't noticed the time.

26:10.041 --> 26:10.875
Tell me, dear.

26:11.166 --> 26:12.458
I miss you.

26:13.208 --> 26:14.208
You're already in bed.

26:14.291 --> 26:15.125
I'm sorry.

26:15.208 --> 26:16.041
You scared me.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.458
I thought you had an accident.

26:19.000 --> 26:19.833
Talk to me.

26:19.916 --> 26:21.458
Don't leave me without
knowing what is happening.

26:23.875 --> 26:24.708
I'm sorry.

26:24.791 --> 26:25.875
Luisa, sorry for all of this.

26:26.208 --> 26:27.041
What?

26:27.125 --> 26:28.083
What are you talking about?

26:28.916 --> 26:29.750
What happened?

26:32.666 --> 26:33.500
Tell me!

26:35.916 --> 26:37.250
It's nothing, it's nothing...

26:38.791 --> 26:39.916
I'm tired.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.500
I just want to go home...

26:41.833 --> 26:43.291
I'm waiting for you...

26:44.833 --> 26:45.666
Luisa...

26:45.916 --> 26:46.750
What?

26:47.166 --> 26:49.041
Lock the doors and be careful.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.375
Don't talk with strangers.

26:53.125 --> 26:53.958
Come on...

26:54.041 --> 26:55.000
Don't worry.

26:55.083 --> 26:55.958
I...

26:56.041 --> 26:58.458
Don't like the idea
of leaving you and Mia alone.

26:59.750 --> 27:00.625
Okay, okay...

27:00.708 --> 27:03.125
Drive carefully and come home.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.166
Go...

27:06.625 --> 27:07.583
Go back to bed.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.416
I'll call you in the morning.

27:11.083 --> 27:11.916
Luisa...

27:16.416 --> 27:17.416
I love you.

27:18.625 --> 27:19.458
I know, I know...

27:21.041 --> 27:21.875
Come home.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.458
Don't scream!

28:07.291 --> 28:08.708
Don't scream, please!

28:09.750 --> 28:11.166
What have you done with me?

28:11.500 --> 28:13.083
Where are the others?

28:14.708 --> 28:16.208
They woke up first

28:16.291 --> 28:18.875
and were taken to good homes
where they will be well treated.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.666
They already have jobs.

28:22.125 --> 28:23.458
They got lucky.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.125
I don't believe you...

28:28.416 --> 28:30.333
You are confused, I understand...

28:31.375 --> 28:34.166
I just want you to know
it was all a misunderstanding.

28:35.958 --> 28:38.041
I'm here to help.

28:39.250 --> 28:40.833
You're one of them, right?

28:41.250 --> 28:42.833
Did you put something in the water?

28:46.375 --> 28:48.250
Why did you come to this country?

28:49.666 --> 28:51.541
To help someone, right?

28:53.791 --> 28:56.125
Thanks to these people
you'll have a job.

28:57.583 --> 28:59.125
You'll make money.

29:00.458 --> 29:02.333
When you pay what you owe

29:02.833 --> 29:04.458
you will be able to decide where to go.

29:06.833 --> 29:09.041
What have they done
with that little girl?

29:10.208 --> 29:11.666
She was taken to the hospital,

29:11.750 --> 29:12.583
of course.

29:14.958 --> 29:17.041
When she gets better,
you'll be able to visit her.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.958
Can I see her right now?

29:39.333 --> 29:40.541
Sure.

31:06.041 --> 31:07.041
- I like that one.

31:08.708 --> 31:09.708
I have a gift for her.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.500
Stay here.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.750
- No, no!

34:29.541 --> 34:30.750
Take your clothes off!

34:40.833 --> 34:41.791
Take your clothes off!

35:27.458 --> 35:29.500
If you do what I say

35:30.875 --> 35:32.375
everything will be all right.

35:33.416 --> 35:34.250
Come on.

35:35.541 --> 35:37.583
I know that you'll be a good girl.

35:46.833 --> 35:48.291
Get dressed!

36:00.791 --> 36:02.833
Prepare these two
to go to Spain

36:03.375 --> 36:04.625
and those to Amsterdam.

36:06.583 --> 36:07.500
You can go.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.375
Stop crying!

36:24.583 --> 36:26.583
You wanted to get
out of your countries?

36:28.208 --> 36:29.916
Well here you are.

36:31.916 --> 36:33.875
But you'll have to work
to pay for that.

36:37.041 --> 36:39.750
And despite it sounds poetic,

36:40.916 --> 36:42.791
right now you belong to me.

36:45.791 --> 36:48.500
In case, one of you
is thinking to escape...

36:50.208 --> 36:52.500
Or say something to the police...

36:53.583 --> 36:55.083
Remember that...

36:56.291 --> 36:58.250
I know where you came from.

36:59.416 --> 37:02.000
I know how many
brothers and sisters you have.

37:02.583 --> 37:05.041
I know where your parents work.

37:07.500 --> 37:11.625
And if suddenly you desire
to do something stupid like that...

37:14.541 --> 37:16.666
Remember they will suffer.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
- The
redhead, she won't make it.

41:27.250 --> 41:28.333
Get rid of her.

42:37.750 --> 42:39.416
Do you speak English?

43:07.833 --> 43:08.833
You're beautiful.

43:27.791 --> 43:28.791
Are you a virgin?

43:37.083 --> 43:38.000
What color are your eyes?

43:40.833 --> 43:42.166
Are they blue, are they green?

43:44.875 --> 43:45.875
- Green.

44:02.750 --> 44:04.375
- Do you know why you're here?

44:10.208 --> 44:14.208
Do you know what's
gonna happen to you?

44:18.041 --> 44:19.291
We're gonna give you

44:19.375 --> 44:23.041
to these ugly, fat,
disgusting, smelly guys

44:26.708 --> 44:27.625
where they gonna fuck you.

44:31.625 --> 44:37.625
And you have to pretend
like you love it.

44:42.750 --> 44:44.041
Sometimes it will hurt.

44:48.208 --> 44:54.208
And if you are a virgin,
sometimes you'll bleed.

44:56.250 --> 44:57.666
Sometimes a lot,
sometimes like little.

45:00.583 --> 45:02.458
Their dicks sometimes are
smaller than a fucking tampon.

45:07.583 --> 45:11.083
But each time, each
time you sleep with 'em

45:14.916 --> 45:15.916
you wanna die.

45:19.250 --> 45:26.250
You wish you will die each
time you lay down with them.

45:31.708 --> 45:35.041
But we're not gonna
let that happen to you.

45:35.125 --> 45:36.125
You know why?

45:39.458 --> 45:40.625
Because you need to pay us.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.291
You need to pay us what you owe.

45:47.625 --> 45:49.125
Or for we're gonna
kill your family.

45:55.333 --> 45:58.375
Oh you girls, you know it's.

45:58.458 --> 45:59.791
That's also gonna
be forgotten soon.

46:02.666 --> 46:05.625
You know, I barely, I
barely remember my family.

46:10.208 --> 46:14.458
I can't remember my mom at all.

46:17.375 --> 46:18.666
I can't remember her
voice, her smile.

46:21.375 --> 46:25.208
But you know, one thing I
remember about my family

46:27.916 --> 46:28.916
is my cat.

46:32.166 --> 46:33.333
That was the only
thing I ever loved.

46:37.166 --> 46:38.500
That's the only thing I
ever remember about family.

46:40.583 --> 46:42.333
Is a fucking cat.

46:49.500 --> 46:50.666
I don't think you're
a cat person.

46:53.875 --> 46:55.875
I think you're a dog person.

46:58.375 --> 46:59.708
Did you have a puppy?

47:06.041 --> 47:07.041
You know what?

47:12.708 --> 47:15.541
The only thing you're gonna
play doggie things right now

47:15.625 --> 47:17.291
it's gonna be doggie
motherfucking style.

47:19.291 --> 47:22.791
That's what you're
gonna be doing.

47:22.875 --> 47:27.333
And you're very pretty,
everybody will tell you that.

47:27.416 --> 47:29.708
Everybody will tell you,
like you were the best.

47:29.791 --> 47:31.291
You were the prettiest,
you've done everything right.

47:32.875 --> 47:33.875
But you know what?

47:36.083 --> 47:38.250
They told that to every
single one of us.

47:41.083 --> 47:42.250
And look what we are.

47:44.250 --> 47:47.250
All fucked up.

48:00.916 --> 48:01.916
She's ready.

48:46.458 --> 48:49.125
- Viktor drives, he
knows where's the hotel.

48:50.041 --> 48:51.041
I can't go.

51:30.458 --> 51:32.875
- Take the girl
with you, Room 306.

51:32.958 --> 51:34.583
I'll be waiting downstairs.

51:34.666 --> 51:36.166
The man will call me
when he's done with her.

51:55.833 --> 51:56.833
- Remember what I told you.

51:58.041 --> 51:59.041
Do whatever he wants.

52:01.166 --> 52:02.166
This is your life now.

53:13.750 --> 53:14.750
- Sit down.

53:19.750 --> 53:22.750
So fucking beautiful, shh.

53:29.666 --> 53:31.166
- Want to fuck with me?

53:31.250 --> 53:32.166
Oh yes, of course
you want to fuck.

53:33.416 --> 53:35.333
- Please stop.
- Shut up!

53:35.416 --> 53:37.083
- Please stop.
- Shut up!

53:37.166 --> 53:39.416
Shut up, quit that
bitch, shut up, shut up.

53:39.500 --> 53:42.833
- Please!
- Shut up.

53:42.916 --> 53:44.916
- Please.

53:52.291 --> 53:53.208
- Look at me.

53:56.625 --> 54:01.041
We're going to fuck.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
Look at here.

54:14.666 --> 54:15.666
- Fuck.

54:21.625 --> 54:22.625
- Hey!

54:23.791 --> 54:24.625
Sveta.

54:27.833 --> 54:29.416
- I'm not going back.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.000
- Get in the fucking car.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.666
- I'm not going back,
I'm not going back.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.500
- Bitch, get in.
Get in the car.

54:38.583 --> 54:40.583
I'm not going back.
Viktor is gonna kill us.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.250
I'm not going back.

54:43.333 --> 54:44.166
- Get out of here before
the cops show up.

54:44.250 --> 54:46.625
Get in the fucking car!

54:46.708 --> 54:49.708
- You don't know
me, you don't know me!

54:50.166 --> 54:51.250
Give my arm!

54:51.333 --> 54:53.166
You are hurting my fucking arm.

54:53.250 --> 54:54.250
- Get in the fucking car.

54:56.333 --> 54:59.125
- You don't know him
like I do, motherfucker.

54:59.208 --> 55:02.291
He's a slimy Russian fucker.

55:02.375 --> 55:03.583
And as soon as we get
there he's gonna kill us.

55:07.708 --> 55:09.625
- What the
fuck, get in the car.

55:12.500 --> 55:13.333
- Thank you, Madame.

55:13.416 --> 55:14.458
Peter, I'll meet you there.

55:51.416 --> 55:54.833
You have a new voice message
received today at 7 a.m.

55:55.666 --> 55:57.875
- Hope to see
you soon Antonio.

55:57.958 --> 55:59.666
Take care my friend.

56:00.666 --> 56:01.791
To listen...

56:20.000 --> 56:21.958
Keep calm,
little sister, keep calm.

56:26.208 --> 56:28.166
Stop dramatizing everything.

56:30.083 --> 56:32.541
This is all because of you.

56:33.916 --> 56:35.416
You act like an idiot.

56:37.291 --> 56:38.583
Keep focus.

56:38.666 --> 56:40.791
I'm sick of cleaning
up the shit you do.

56:41.208 --> 56:42.375
That I do?

56:59.958 --> 57:00.958
- Already here?

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
- We had a problem.

57:04.791 --> 57:06.458
The girl jumped from the window.

57:09.666 --> 57:10.666
- What?

57:31.833 --> 57:32.833
Sit down.

57:39.500 --> 57:40.500
You stay.

57:56.625 --> 57:57.625
- Say it again.

58:00.583 --> 58:01.583
- The girl.

58:04.125 --> 58:05.625
She jumped from
the hotel window.

58:07.708 --> 58:10.041
- Yes, she's dead.

58:12.041 --> 58:13.041
- Oh.

58:14.541 --> 58:15.541
- That's so nice.

58:18.208 --> 58:20.375
Thank you for coming and
tell this shitty story.

58:32.458 --> 58:35.125
Well, Sveta, what story
will you tell me?

58:40.000 --> 58:40.833
Sveta?

58:43.750 --> 58:44.625
- There's no story.

58:49.166 --> 58:51.375
- Are you afraid of me?
- No.

58:51.458 --> 58:54.333
No, the girl jumped
from the window.

58:54.416 --> 58:55.250
She's dead, she
committed suicide.

58:57.416 --> 58:59.000
- After all
this fucking time

58:59.083 --> 59:00.750
are you afraid of me?

59:01.666 --> 59:04.875
- No, I love you.

59:09.750 --> 59:11.750
Please, Viktor, please, I.

59:13.291 --> 59:18.291
- Today you learn something,
never accept apologies.

59:27.791 --> 59:28.708
Please don't kill me.

59:32.208 --> 59:36.625
- Sveta, I will not kill you.

59:36.708 --> 59:37.708
He will.

59:43.791 --> 59:46.291
Go kid, kill the bitch.

59:50.833 --> 59:51.666
Viktor...

59:55.833 --> 59:57.958
- Please, Viktor.

59:58.041 --> 59:59.541
- You kill her or you will die.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.208
- Please don't.
- Okay.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Lesson number two.

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:13.583
When a guy that has killed
someone in front of you

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:21.250
tell you to kill someone,
don't talk, just do it.

01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:26.333
So, how it's gonna be?

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:31.666
Come on kid, you
have two options.

01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:36.083
Kill her or have a
bullet in your head.

01:00:40.416 --> 01:00:42.625
- No please Viktor,
please, please.

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:44.708
Please, don't do
this, I love you.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:53.875
Look, I can't remember how
many cocks I've sucked.

01:00:53.958 --> 01:00:54.958
- Shut up.

01:00:57.541 --> 01:00:59.000
- There are countless
of dicks I have fucked.

01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:02.083
- Shut up, sh!

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:04.708
- Do you know what?

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:09.833
Fuck you, you were the wor--

01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:18.375
- Good job, kid.

01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:19.458
I'm proud.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:27.916
Go, call Mario.

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.250
Alanna, clean this.

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:07.625
You have a job to do.

01:02:09.208 --> 01:02:10.208
You have to get the cargo.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:12.125
Understand me?

01:02:14.458 --> 01:02:15.666
And I don't want more shit.

01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:19.125
Go.

01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:27.625
Mario, not you, you stay.

01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:33.125
I can only trust
you, understand me.

01:02:38.125 --> 01:02:39.125
Take care of my girls.

01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:27.791
- Sh.

01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:44.208
- Shh.

01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:48.625
- Ow, ow!

01:09:50.041 --> 01:09:50.875
Listen...

01:09:53.332 --> 01:09:54.833
I don't work more with the truck.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:56.583
It's over.

01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:58.500
I don't work for you anymore.

01:09:58.875 --> 01:09:59.708
It's over.

01:10:16.958 --> 01:10:18.375
Did you like the child?

01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:24.708
I also like children, Antonio...

01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:29.833
But do you know...

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:33.375
If I had a granddaughter like you have,

01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:36.458
I would think twice.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.625
- Antonio, I have
been good for you.

01:10:46.333 --> 01:10:48.333
But don't fuck with me.

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:51.291
Go to truck.

01:10:51.375 --> 01:10:52.375
Go home.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:55.666
Enjoy your fucking family.

01:10:58.291 --> 01:11:00.500
And when I send you a message...

01:11:01.666 --> 01:11:03.416
You'd better be available.

01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:57.125
- Shh!
- No.

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:01.208
- Calm down, calm
down, calm down.

01:13:01.291 --> 01:13:04.291
Shh, I'm not going to hurt you.

01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:06.458
I'm trying to help, okay?

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:13.625
See, they were
going to sell you.

01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:15.791
But I'm going to take
you to your family.

01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:18.458
Okay?

01:13:19.166 --> 01:13:21.708
It's okay.

01:13:21.791 --> 01:13:22.791
Look.

01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:35.916
Mario ran away.

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:43.500
That son of a bitch took one
of them and ran away.

01:14:46.416 --> 01:14:47.625
Go and find them.

01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:06.583
Did I say something
that is not clear?

01:15:09.666 --> 01:15:10.708
Stop looking at me.

01:15:13.125 --> 01:15:15.250
Do you want us
to have problems?

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:17.125
I told you

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:19.291
do everything you can

01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:20.250
to find them.

01:15:20.333 --> 01:15:21.333
Got it?

01:15:26.041 --> 01:15:27.041
Out!

01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:19.583
He was already dead
when we found him.

01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:23.875
And the girl?

01:17:24.958 --> 01:17:25.916
I don't know.

01:17:29.666 --> 01:17:31.625
If you weren't my sister,

01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:34.125
I would kill you.

01:17:35.666 --> 01:17:37.333
It was you who trusted Mario,

01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:39.916
don't blame me
for your mistakes, please.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.958
What were you doing
when all this happened?

01:17:48.541 --> 01:17:50.125
Do you really want to talk about it?

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.958
Right now I don't have time
for conversations.

01:17:55.083 --> 01:17:57.833
I want everyone out of here today.

01:18:55.666 --> 01:18:56.833
Grandma! Grandma!

01:18:57.458 --> 01:18:58.416
What happened?

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:36.833
Are you ready to leave?

01:19:49.041 --> 01:19:51.083
I have to do something first.

01:21:46.708 --> 01:21:48.416
Hail Mary full of grace,

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.583
The Lord is with you,

01:21:49.666 --> 01:21:51.458
blessed are you among women.

01:21:51.541 --> 01:21:54.458
And blessed is the fruit
of your womb, Jesus.

01:21:54.833 --> 01:21:56.375
Holly Mary mother of God,

01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:58.125
pray for us sinners,

01:21:58.375 --> 01:22:00.000
Now and at the hour of our death.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:00.916
Amen.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.250
Hail Mary full of grace,

01:22:02.333 --> 01:22:03.583
The Lord is with you,

01:22:03.666 --> 01:22:05.541
blessed are you among women.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.708
And blessed is the fruit
of your womb, Jesus.

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:10.333
Holly Mary mother of God,

01:22:10.416 --> 01:22:12.083
pray for us sinners,

01:22:12.416 --> 01:22:14.208
Now and at the hour of our death.

01:22:14.291 --> 01:22:15.125
Amen.

01:22:15.458 --> 01:22:17.250
Hail Mary full of grace,

01:22:17.541 --> 01:22:18.708
The Lord is with you...

01:22:24.458 --> 01:22:25.291
No.

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:26.208
Wait, wait, wait...

01:22:26.291 --> 01:22:27.291
Keep calm! Keep calm.

01:22:27.875 --> 01:22:28.791
Keep calm.

01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:29.708
Don't be afraid.

01:22:29.791 --> 01:22:30.625
No one's gonna hurt you...

01:22:30.708 --> 01:22:31.708
Keep calm. Keep calm.

01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:33.416
I'm releasing you.

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.083
Take it.

01:23:56.333 --> 01:23:57.875
Come on, eat the soup.

01:23:58.125 --> 01:23:59.208
It will be good for you.

01:24:00.208 --> 01:24:01.583
Why doesn't she speak?

01:24:02.125 --> 01:24:03.875
Because...

01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:05.833
She doesn't speak our language.

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:07.250
We probably were not going.

01:24:07.666 --> 01:24:08.500
Look...

01:24:08.583 --> 01:24:09.416
Do it like this...

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:11.583
Blow.

01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:21.958
It's hot.

01:24:23.083 --> 01:24:23.916
It was just made.

01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:27.250
Look...

01:24:27.333 --> 01:24:28.458
My name is Luisa.

01:24:28.541 --> 01:24:29.375
Luisa.

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:31.208
And this is Mia.

01:24:32.916 --> 01:24:33.833
And you?

01:24:33.916 --> 01:24:34.750
You?

01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:36.875
Viktoriya.

01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:38.375
Viktoriya.

01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:42.083
Her name is Viktoriya.

01:24:45.333 --> 01:24:46.708
We're gonna help you.

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.250
My husband will
help you get back home.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.041
He is a good man.

01:24:53.916 --> 01:24:54.750
You'll see.

01:25:02.375 --> 01:25:03.208
Listen, Mia...

01:25:05.708 --> 01:25:07.583
You're not going to tell
anyone that she's here.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.541
Don't tell anyone!

01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:10.958
Are you listening to Grandma?

01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:11.916
Yes.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.458
Otherwise we cannot help her.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.666
Now eat the soup.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.666
You're very quiet.

01:25:51.541 --> 01:25:52.916
Did something happen?

01:25:56.166 --> 01:25:57.791
I'm waiting for you to tell me...

01:25:59.916 --> 01:26:01.208
Tell you what?

01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:07.750
That you're planning
to runaway from the country...

01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:10.791
And leave me here.

01:26:15.375 --> 01:26:17.500
I'm not one of your whores.

01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:21.166
Alanna,

01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:24.791
of course not, you are my sister.

01:26:26.458 --> 01:26:28.250
We both know that's not true.

01:26:35.875 --> 01:26:37.416
You had a happy childhood.

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:38.666
You got everything.

01:26:42.333 --> 01:26:44.541
Your mother could not
have more children,

01:26:44.916 --> 01:26:46.458
and she wanted a daughter.

01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:54.208
My father loved you.

01:26:59.833 --> 01:27:02.583
Was that why he came
to my room every night

01:27:04.208 --> 01:27:05.583
and raped me?

01:27:11.208 --> 01:27:13.083
Yes, I know that you knew.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:16.833
You know...

01:27:19.416 --> 01:27:21.708
I thought I should be grateful,

01:27:24.333 --> 01:27:26.541
but I was a whore like the others.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.291
When he died...

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:36.291
I thought you looked
at me like a sister.

01:27:37.666 --> 01:27:39.583
But now I discovered

01:27:39.958 --> 01:27:42.666
that all those years you knew
what he was doing to me.

01:27:47.916 --> 01:27:48.750
Viktor.

01:27:52.833 --> 01:27:54.375
Did you jerk off thinking
about me?

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.250
Or were you masturbating

01:27:58.333 --> 01:28:00.375
while seeing the fotos?

01:30:23.833 --> 01:30:24.666
May I?

01:30:26.541 --> 01:30:27.875
I brought some tea...

01:30:28.666 --> 01:30:30.000
It will help you sleep.

01:30:31.333 --> 01:30:33.166
I also couldn't get to sleep.

01:30:45.291 --> 01:30:46.125
Look...

01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:48.291
This one...

01:30:48.666 --> 01:30:49.750
Is my daughter.

01:30:51.041 --> 01:30:51.875
This one...

01:30:52.541 --> 01:30:53.791
It's Mia's mother.

01:31:00.916 --> 01:31:03.166
She had to leave the country
in search of a better life.

01:31:06.166 --> 01:31:08.041
When I look at you,
I imagine that...

01:31:08.791 --> 01:31:11.125
If something like that
happened to my daughter...

01:31:13.541 --> 01:31:15.541
I don't know what.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.208
She's so far.

01:31:27.083 --> 01:31:29.083
I don't know
why I'm here talking...

01:31:29.541 --> 01:31:31.583
You don't understand anything
that I say, do you?

01:31:52.916 --> 01:31:54.000
Poor girl.

01:32:03.875 --> 01:32:05.250
Drink your tea, please.

01:32:05.958 --> 01:32:06.791
Drink.

01:32:40.833 --> 01:32:42.291
Where the fuck is Viktor?

01:32:44.541 --> 01:32:45.541
- He's gone.

01:34:42.916 --> 01:34:44.750
My God...

01:34:46.291 --> 01:34:47.583
Oh...

01:34:52.916 --> 01:34:53.875
So...

01:34:55.041 --> 01:34:56.208
Are you hungry?

01:34:56.833 --> 01:34:57.666
No.

01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:59.000
I can go make
something for you to eat,

01:34:59.083 --> 01:35:00.291
or there's leftovers in the fridge.

01:35:00.375 --> 01:35:01.291
It tastes good.

01:35:01.375 --> 01:35:02.208
I'm not hungry.

01:35:03.541 --> 01:35:04.916
I'm tired...

01:35:05.333 --> 01:35:06.166
Yes.

01:35:06.250 --> 01:35:07.083
From this work...

01:35:07.166 --> 01:35:08.125
To spend days and nights out.

01:35:11.291 --> 01:35:12.791
But you have to do it.

01:35:12.875 --> 01:35:13.708
Yeah...

01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:16.250
I know, but I'm going
to stop working on this truck.

01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:22.625
But then how do you make money?

01:35:23.583 --> 01:35:24.416
Don't know.

01:35:25.416 --> 01:35:26.250
We have to find...

01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:27.166
Grandpa!

01:35:27.250 --> 01:35:28.083
Oh Mia!

01:35:28.166 --> 01:35:29.000
Give...

01:35:29.083 --> 01:35:30.625
Grandpa a big hug.

01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:32.083
And a big kiss!

01:35:36.166 --> 01:35:37.125
Get in!

01:35:37.416 --> 01:35:38.375
Come here!

01:35:59.333 --> 01:36:01.791
Viktor disappeared.

01:36:01.875 --> 01:36:03.583
I think they are trying
to leave the country.

01:36:03.666 --> 01:36:04.500
We must move now.

01:36:18.916 --> 01:36:20.541
You don't know anything about her...

01:36:21.625 --> 01:36:22.666
So?

01:36:24.208 --> 01:36:25.250
Does it really matters?

01:36:26.583 --> 01:36:28.750
She got here.

01:36:31.625 --> 01:36:33.041
What was I supposed to do?

01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:37.000
Imagine if it was your daughter.

01:36:37.416 --> 01:36:38.500
But she's not.

01:36:42.291 --> 01:36:45.583
We shouldn't do to others
what we don't like others do to us.

01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:46.708
So I helped her.

01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:52.375
I'm sure she didn't do anything wrong.

01:36:52.458 --> 01:36:55.625
She arrived here completely lost and broken,
someone must have hurt her.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.583
One more reason
why she shouldn't be in our house.

01:37:02.291 --> 01:37:04.708
Luisa, you can't
save the whole world.

01:37:16.041 --> 01:37:17.375
Then tell me...

01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:19.583
What would you do?

01:37:22.208 --> 01:37:24.250
Welcome to this nocturnal broadcast.

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:26.583
Breaking news...

01:37:26.666 --> 01:37:30.666
A Human Trafficking Network
is in police radar.

01:37:33.375 --> 01:37:34.250
You know what?

01:37:34.875 --> 01:37:36.625
I'm going to bed, I'm tired.

01:37:48.625 --> 01:37:50.083
- It's a good
spot but we can't stay here.

01:37:50.166 --> 01:37:51.125
We have to move.

01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:27.583
- I've always wanted to do this.

01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:31.958
- Wake up, wake up.

01:39:32.041 --> 01:39:33.583
Look at me, wake up, wake up.

01:39:36.916 --> 01:39:39.083
Sh, look at me, look at me.

01:39:39.166 --> 01:39:41.666
I'm a cop, okay, I'm a cop.

01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:42.833
I know you've been
through a lot.

01:39:42.916 --> 01:39:44.166
You're hurt and you're tired.

01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:45.208
But you have to trust me.

01:39:45.291 --> 01:39:46.291
You have to stay here.

01:39:58.750 --> 01:40:02.000
You don't understand
anything I say, do you?

01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:04.750
Stay here, okay?

01:40:04.833 --> 01:40:05.833
Stay here.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.625
- How are you?
- Can't stay for too long.

01:40:39.708 --> 01:40:41.125
- Where's the girl?

01:40:41.208 --> 01:40:42.208
- She didn't stop crying.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.666
Things are getting
out of control.

01:41:03.666 --> 01:41:04.666
Good luck.

01:42:33.875 --> 01:42:35.250
You work for them!

01:42:45.416 --> 01:42:47.083
I don't understand what you're saying...

01:42:51.083 --> 01:42:52.750
But whatever it is...

01:42:56.416 --> 01:42:57.791
You're absolutely right.

01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:05.625
Because I am...

01:43:09.375 --> 01:43:10.583
A criminal...

01:43:15.333 --> 01:43:17.083
That helps to sell people.

01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:28.666
That Russian bastard...

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.125
Bribe me...

01:43:32.583 --> 01:43:33.416
Money...

01:43:35.041 --> 01:43:36.083
Money.

01:43:37.791 --> 01:43:38.833
And for money...

01:43:43.166 --> 01:43:45.041
I help to traffic...

01:43:48.166 --> 01:43:49.541
People and children...

01:43:50.458 --> 01:43:52.500
Innocents...

01:43:55.458 --> 01:43:56.708
Just like my granddaughter.

01:44:07.291 --> 01:44:09.208
I'm worse than Judas.

01:44:10.875 --> 01:44:12.333
Judas!

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.416
I have no forgiveness.

01:45:33.666 --> 01:45:34.875
Police, good afternoon...

01:45:34.958 --> 01:45:36.000
Nineteenth Police Squad.

01:45:36.083 --> 01:45:36.916
How can I help?

01:45:38.708 --> 01:45:39.541
Hello?

01:45:42.916 --> 01:45:43.750
Hello?

01:45:46.416 --> 01:45:48.208
I can hear that someone is on the phone.

01:45:51.041 --> 01:45:51.958
Do you need help?

01:47:21.541 --> 01:47:22.375
A life.

01:47:25.083 --> 01:47:26.166
A better life.

01:47:33.833 --> 01:47:35.708
It was the only thing
I ever wanted.

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:39.125
But I only found bad things.

01:47:42.083 --> 01:47:43.708
And I didn't deserve them.

01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:58.750
I survived.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.166
But I'm dead.

01:48:16.458 --> 01:48:18.833
All those who close their eyes...

01:48:19.458 --> 01:48:21.416
Are accomplices.

01:48:28.375 --> 01:48:29.958
None of them deserves forgiveness.

01:48:40.125 --> 01:48:42.166
I can't forget the faces of the people

01:48:42.250 --> 01:48:44.208
who traveled with me on that truck.

01:48:47.791 --> 01:48:50.041
Neither the cries
of the women in the house.

01:48:53.583 --> 01:48:55.500
I'll never be the same.

01:48:58.125 --> 01:48:59.250
But I'm alive.

01:49:03.875 --> 01:49:05.375
No matter what
the future has for me...

01:49:09.458 --> 01:49:10.833
I will never be broken.

01:49:19.625 --> 01:49:21.500
This is my cargo.
