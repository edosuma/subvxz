01:39.350 --> 01:43.263
Fair seat, bad hands,
mount not sufficiently schooled.

01:50.870 --> 01:52.383
Disqualified.

01:52.470 --> 01:55.348
Here comes the California cockerel
Ten pesos he clears 'em all.

01:55.430 --> 01:57.421
Cleanly? Taken.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.741
Grow wings, my friend.

02:09.949 --> 02:12.942
Ten pesos, if you please.

02:13.030 --> 02:17.501
Maybe you've forgotten that in California
they use horses for cradles.

02:19.390 --> 02:22.302
- Well done, señor. Excellent.
- And all I did was sit on his back.

02:22.390 --> 02:25.382
Three carrots after his oats tonight.

02:28.630 --> 02:32.828
- You go to an affair of the court?
- No, of the heart.

02:35.190 --> 02:39.103
- Something is wrong.
- The face, man. The face...

02:39.190 --> 02:40.908
Why the fine feathers?

02:40.990 --> 02:43.902
A señorita that would put St Anthony
on the griddle. We're to meet in...

02:43.990 --> 02:48.984
Have you forgotten that you cross swords
with Lieutenant Cortez at three o'clock?

02:49.070 --> 02:51.459
It slipped my mind.

02:53.630 --> 02:56.269
Why do I have to meet
every swordsman in Madrid?

02:56.350 --> 02:59.501
Everybody enjoys a certain amount of
fighting, but why do they all pick on me?

02:59.590 --> 03:03.629
Calm yourself. It's become a distinction
to assail a California cockerel.

03:03.710 --> 03:07.862
You pink them slightly in the arm or shoulder
and they boast of having met you.

03:09.270 --> 03:14.060
Cadet Vega, the commandant wishes
to see you in his office at once.

03:14.150 --> 03:18.666
Good. I can't possibly fight the fellow now.
Explain that to him, will you?

03:18.750 --> 03:21.742
And tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.

03:37.950 --> 03:41.386
Señores, your attention, please.

03:41.470 --> 03:44.303
I'm buying wine for all.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.621
Come on.
It's your last chance to fill up on me.

03:47.710 --> 03:50.144
Last chance?
What do you mean?

03:50.230 --> 03:55.463
My father has ordered me home.
I sail on the first ship from Lisbon.

03:55.550 --> 03:58.428
To California?
But what about your commission here?

03:58.510 --> 04:00.785
I'll have to give that up.

04:00.870 --> 04:04.465
What's it like in California?
Are the Indians troublesome?

04:04.550 --> 04:06.939
- Then who is there to fight?
- No one.

04:07.030 --> 04:11.069
Then what will you do with
this spur of yours, my cockerel?

04:13.710 --> 04:15.701
This...

04:20.350 --> 04:22.466
Leave it there.

04:22.550 --> 04:24.825
And when you see it,
think of me,

04:24.910 --> 04:31.065
in a land of gentle missions, happy peons,
sleepy caballeros, and everlasting boredom.

04:31.150 --> 04:33.141
Wine.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.105
A toast.

04:39.190 --> 04:42.262
To California,
where a man can only marry,

04:42.350 --> 04:45.387
raise fat children,
and watch his vineyards grow.

05:05.710 --> 05:11.068
- Are the vineyards bearing well this season?
- By some miracle the grapes remain sweet.

05:11.150 --> 05:16.144
- Why so gloomy, my friend?
- People can't sing with hatred in their hearts.

05:16.230 --> 05:21.350
- Hatred for whom?
- The alcalde. May his soul burn in hell.

05:21.430 --> 05:25.025
The alcalde?
A kinder, better man never lived.

05:25.110 --> 05:27.066
You don't know him.

05:27.150 --> 05:30.142
I should know him.
He's my father.

05:33.030 --> 05:37.706
I said it, and I won't deny it. I've taken
20 lashes before for a slip of the tongue.

05:39.670 --> 05:42.582
Row, row.
Get me to shore.

05:53.430 --> 05:57.548
- I'm honoured. How can I serve you?
- A glass of your best wine.

06:18.110 --> 06:22.262
- You are a stranger in these parts?
- No, not exactly.

06:22.350 --> 06:24.910
I was born and raised not far from here.

06:24.990 --> 06:27.788
I am the son of the alcalde.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.104
Where can I get a carriage
to drive me to Los Angeles?

06:46.190 --> 06:48.943
Well, wake up.
Didn't you hear me?

06:49.030 --> 06:51.021
This way.

06:53.910 --> 06:59.860
Pedro, here is a caballero who would
employ you. He is the son of the alcalde.

06:59.950 --> 07:03.625
I want to be driven to Los Angeles.
I have some boxes and a portmanteau.

07:04.150 --> 07:06.380
I'll pay you well.

07:06.470 --> 07:08.938
Stop staring at me.
Will you drive me or not?

07:10.550 --> 07:12.939
What's come over this country?
Have you all gone mad?

07:13.030 --> 07:16.989
Listen, you.
Find speech, or I'll cut out your tongue.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.949
Please. You are too late.
Your good father has already attended to that.

07:21.030 --> 07:22.509
My father?
What are you talking about?

07:22.590 --> 07:28.142
I'm sorry, but at a meeting of the peons,
this man spoke against the heavy taxes.

07:28.230 --> 07:33.827
The next day, the soldiers of His Excellency
cut out his tongue. I swear it is true.

08:30.790 --> 08:34.669
Therefore, until we receive
the reinforcements promised us...

08:45.670 --> 08:50.346
So people can still laugh in California.
I'd begun to think they'd lost the habit.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.990
- Your name?
- He claims to be the son of the alcalde.

08:53.070 --> 08:57.586
I claim nothing. I am Diego Vega,
son of His Excellency, Don Alejandro.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.901
And this, although I find it
greatly changed, is my home.

09:00.990 --> 09:04.346
Your pardon, Don Diego. I'd not heard
of your returning. Welcome to California.

09:04.430 --> 09:07.786
I'm Capitán Esteban Pasquale,
military aid to the alcalde.

09:07.870 --> 09:10.384
I'm honoured, but bewildered.

09:10.470 --> 09:14.258
Why has my father turned
his home into a barracks?

09:14.350 --> 09:20.107
Conditions have changed since you left.
Your father resigned. Age, you know.

09:20.190 --> 09:23.865
Since then, the peons have
become more industrious.

09:23.950 --> 09:27.784
As to the caballeros, they're
encouraged to think of their own affairs.

09:27.870 --> 09:29.747
We take care of the government.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.459
I see.

09:35.790 --> 09:39.783
- Tell me, who holds the office now?
- Don Luis Quintero. I'll take you to him.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.384
Thank you, but I should like to see
my family as quickly as possible.

09:42.470 --> 09:44.461
- Where are they living?
- At your old hacienda.

09:44.550 --> 09:47.667
But His Excellency'll never forgive me if I let
you go without a word of welcome from him.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.981
I'm quite sure
that you'll save me a reprimand.

09:51.070 --> 09:54.221
How could I refuse a man anything
with a naked sword in his hand?

09:54.310 --> 09:59.259
So a wit has come to Los Angeles.
Carry out your orders, Sergeant.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.619
Foolish habit of mine.

10:02.710 --> 10:06.419
Some men play with a glove,
or a monocle, or a snuffbox.

10:06.510 --> 10:10.469
Churchmen finger their beads.
I toy with a sword.

10:10.550 --> 10:13.018
Do you fancy the weapon?

10:13.110 --> 10:19.299
I know very little about it, my dear capitán.
Swordplay is such a violent business.

10:28.670 --> 10:32.822
So, this is the bird that killed
the black-breasted red?

10:32.910 --> 10:35.060
Was it a bloody battle?

10:35.150 --> 10:39.462
At the side of the pit,
all the people were covered with blood.

10:39.550 --> 10:43.259
Pity I missed it.
What are you asking for him?

10:43.350 --> 10:49.380
This is a noble bird. Well tested.
I'm asking 40 pesos for him.

10:49.470 --> 10:53.258
40 pesos? Esteban, this cheating dog
should have his taxes raised.

10:53.350 --> 10:56.706
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
The bird is yours, as a gift.

10:56.790 --> 11:01.739
- Not one centimo will he cost you.
- That's a better attitude. Much better.

11:01.830 --> 11:04.628
Turn him over to my handlers.

11:11.070 --> 11:14.301
And what caballero is this?
Or is he some young lord from Spain?

11:14.390 --> 11:16.824
A good guess, Excellency.
He's just from Spain.

11:16.910 --> 11:21.028
This is Don Diego Vega,
son of your respected predecessor.

11:21.110 --> 11:24.739
I thought such fabric came from Madrid.
Must have cost you plenty, eh?

11:24.830 --> 11:28.948
The caballero is here for words of welcome,
not to discuss the price of his clothes.

11:29.030 --> 11:31.305
Of course.
To be sure.

11:31.390 --> 11:36.180
Welcome back, young sir.
Regard this house as still your home.

11:36.270 --> 11:39.467
Luis, a ship has arrived from Spain.

11:39.550 --> 11:42.189
The shops will have something
worth looking at at last. I need...

11:42.270 --> 11:44.545
Money.
It's always money.

11:44.630 --> 11:46.985
I don't know this caballero.

11:47.070 --> 11:49.982
- He's just off your precious ship from Spain.
- How delightful.

11:50.070 --> 11:52.948
Will one of you ill-mannered boors
present him?

11:53.030 --> 11:55.419
Don Diego Vega.
Señora Inez de Quintero.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.978
My wife.

11:58.070 --> 12:00.300
Your Excellency is a very fortunate man.

12:00.390 --> 12:03.860
I'm not so sure.
She thinks pesos grow on mulberry trees.

12:03.950 --> 12:07.340
Your husband was also fascinated
by the caballero's clothes.

12:07.430 --> 12:10.024
Your pardon.
We're overwhelmed by the latest fashions.

12:10.110 --> 12:13.898
And no wonder.
What is there here to interest a woman?

12:14.830 --> 12:19.267
I long for the life you've been leading.
The gaiety and splendour of the court.

12:19.350 --> 12:24.549
- Patience, my love. You'll see it all someday.
- Doubtless, when I'm an old hag.

12:24.630 --> 12:27.781
That catastrophe could never overtake you.

12:27.870 --> 12:32.307
Did you hear? How easily
he makes pretty speeches.

12:32.390 --> 12:34.142
I regret that...

12:43.110 --> 12:45.988
You were saying?

12:46.070 --> 12:48.504
I was saying that I must tear myself away

12:48.590 --> 12:51.150
and make some speeches
to my father and mother.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.983
Don't leave me to these barbarians.

12:54.070 --> 12:57.460
Come to the shops with me
and help me make my selections.

12:57.550 --> 13:00.906
Oh, you tempt me.

13:02.350 --> 13:04.659
I love the shimmer of satin and silk,

13:04.750 --> 13:08.265
the matching of one delicate shade
against the other.

13:08.350 --> 13:11.387
Then there's the choosing
of scents and lotions -

13:11.470 --> 13:16.669
attar of rose, carnation,
crushed lily, and musk.

13:19.030 --> 13:23.785
- As for ornaments and jewels...
- But Don Diego must see his parents.

13:23.870 --> 13:27.545
Too true.
Duty rather than pleasure.

13:31.550 --> 13:34.144
I'll see you to the door.

13:43.430 --> 13:46.979
That's one little peacock
that won't give us any trouble.

13:47.070 --> 13:49.459
You think not?

13:51.110 --> 13:56.138
The capitán is jealous. The fop has
pricked the fencing master. Touché.

14:00.590 --> 14:04.378
I don't like such jests.
Your eye might fail you.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.665
It's possible.

14:20.590 --> 14:23.150
- Who was that?
- No one you know.

14:23.230 --> 14:28.509
- Someone new. Very charming.
- He must be, from the colour in your cheeks.

14:28.590 --> 14:32.026
At last, after all these months
in this dreary place,

14:32.110 --> 14:36.547
someone who knows the newest fashions,
the latest dances, how to flatter a woman.

14:36.630 --> 14:39.190
- When can I meet him?
- Listen to the child.

14:39.270 --> 14:44.060
You're much too young to cope with his sort.
Why do you allow her to wear that mantilla?

14:44.150 --> 14:46.380
It makes her look like a woman grown.

14:46.470 --> 14:49.746
I am a woman grown.
I'll be 18 my next birthday.

14:49.830 --> 14:53.584
Carmen Castellano
is a month younger and already wed.

14:53.670 --> 14:57.583
Her grandmother was a peon.
Such riffraff wed when they like.

14:57.670 --> 15:01.219
You have the blood
of the hidalgos in your veins.

15:01.310 --> 15:05.144
Keep it cool, my girl,
or I'll whisk you into a convent.

15:12.990 --> 15:16.221
I pity your poor mount, Sergeant.
Such a heavy whip.

15:16.310 --> 15:21.509
Do you think I'd strike a good mare with this?
It would ruin her, break her spirit.

15:23.350 --> 15:25.989
See? She didn't flick an ear.

15:26.070 --> 15:30.302
She knows. We are collecting
taxes from the peons today.

15:31.990 --> 15:35.187
And you use that little switch
on the taxpayers?

15:35.270 --> 15:37.500
Only when they are stubborn.

15:39.070 --> 15:43.348
When you come to collect my taxes,
I won't be stubborn, I promise you.

15:43.430 --> 15:44.829
Turn right in here.

15:55.270 --> 15:57.067
Mother.

15:58.670 --> 16:02.549
- My son. My baby.
- Mother.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.825
Hello, María.

16:05.990 --> 16:08.788
Good old Juan, fat as ever.

16:08.870 --> 16:11.464
Hello, Manuel. And José.
Where's Father?

16:11.550 --> 16:15.304
In the study with Fray Felipe.
Come, he's longing to see you.

16:15.390 --> 16:18.188
Take Don Diego's things to his room.

16:19.910 --> 16:22.743
I tell you,
these conditions are beyond bearing.

16:22.830 --> 16:26.823
This whole district, from the hills
of Verdugo to the shores of Del Rey,

16:26.910 --> 16:28.866
is a stench in the nostrils of heaven.

16:28.950 --> 16:31.384
- I know.
- You know, yes.

16:31.470 --> 16:34.860
- But what do you do about it? Nothing.
- What can...

16:36.550 --> 16:38.620
Father.

16:39.390 --> 16:41.460
My boy.

16:41.550 --> 16:43.666
Padre.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.980
Welcome back to your home and my heart.

16:46.070 --> 16:50.222
- I've missed your wise counsel.
- Not too greatly, I suspect.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.382
You remember Don Miguel and Don José?

16:54.030 --> 16:57.227
- Have you returned to steal more melons?
- Melons?

16:57.310 --> 17:00.427
This scamp and my scapegrace son
crept into my garden

17:00.510 --> 17:03.627
and gorged themselves
on my seed melons one year.

17:03.710 --> 17:08.989
But God punished us. We were visited
by the father of all bellyaches.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.540
But he's ripe for more
than boyish pranks now.

17:12.630 --> 17:16.781
- I feel good muscle here.
- Arms, muscle... You men.

17:16.869 --> 17:21.068
Is he without a face? Can't you see he's
even better-looking than when he left?

17:21.150 --> 17:23.823
You should have seen me when I approached
the Spanish throne for the first time.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.583
They said I looked like a frightened gopher.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.661
More like a young angel, I'm sure.

17:28.750 --> 17:33.870
An angel. That's what we need in California
now. An angel with a flaming sword.

17:33.950 --> 17:36.828
Please, don't start that.
He didn't come home to get himself killed.

17:36.910 --> 17:42.428
Hold your tongue. Go to your women.
Leave my son to me. Sit down, Diego.

17:45.590 --> 17:49.424
- What is all this, Father?
- Well, I am no longer alcalde.

17:49.510 --> 17:54.789
- In my place is a man...
- In his place sits a viper so foul and black...

17:54.870 --> 17:58.499
Ah, to be alone with him
for five little minutes.

17:58.590 --> 18:01.787
Long enough to tear
his windpipe out of his throat.

18:01.870 --> 18:04.179
God forgive me.

18:04.270 --> 18:07.979
- Why did you resign in the first place?
- I was forced out of office.

18:08.070 --> 18:10.345
They threatened
to burn the homes of the peons.

18:10.430 --> 18:14.628
- And now he sits here doing nothing, when...
- Enough, Felipe.

18:14.710 --> 18:17.827
The friar urges me
to lead the caballeros in a revolt

18:17.910 --> 18:20.982
which would surely fail
against a garrison of trained soldiers.

18:21.070 --> 18:24.142
Even if I thought it would succeed,
I'd refuse just the same.

18:24.230 --> 18:27.859
- But why?
- Because the law is the law.

18:27.950 --> 18:30.703
I will not rebel against the government
I served for 30 years.

18:30.790 --> 18:32.940
But that government is now vile and corrupt.

18:33.030 --> 18:37.182
I know, but two wrongs
don't make a right, and never will.

18:37.270 --> 18:41.707
- That is my feeling also.
- Sometimes, one must fight fire with fire.

18:41.790 --> 18:46.739
I am a Vega. I will not follow
the lawless footsteps of Luis Quintero.

18:46.830 --> 18:51.221
- Nor will my son.
- No, of course not.

18:51.310 --> 18:54.859
By the way, I went directly
from the ship to our old home.

18:54.950 --> 18:59.705
I met Señor Quintero and his charming wife.
I found them very pleasant and agreeable.

18:59.790 --> 19:03.385
Pleasant scorpions.
Agreeable rattlesnakes.

19:03.470 --> 19:07.429
Oh, Padre. The alcalde spoke
with great respect of you, Father.

19:08.750 --> 19:12.425
I must admit he hasn't
troubled me or my flocks so far.

19:14.270 --> 19:18.582
That being the case,
why get overly excited in this heat?

19:18.670 --> 19:21.787
I know I'm going to miss
the scented breezes of Spain.

19:21.870 --> 19:26.990
Then you believe we should not be moved
by injustice and cruelty until it touches us?

19:27.070 --> 19:31.985
But, my dear Padre, such things
exist in the world and always will.

19:32.070 --> 19:35.699
By the way, I took up sleight of hand
while I was in Madrid.

19:35.790 --> 19:39.180
It's all the rage just now.
Watch closely.

19:50.670 --> 19:53.582
To think that the boy that I helped to raise,

19:53.670 --> 19:59.347
the boy that I taught to hold a firm wrist
behind a true point, has turned into a puppy.

20:04.550 --> 20:09.670
How vexatious. Well, I must go
and remove the dust of travel.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.025
I'll see you later, Father.

22:13.630 --> 22:16.019
Stay where you are.

22:20.950 --> 22:24.579
Put this up.
Put it up. Be quick about it.

22:36.990 --> 22:39.379
Back to the barracks.

23:29.870 --> 23:34.944
I don't understand why you insist on
this stupid drive. And without an escort.

23:35.030 --> 23:39.228
- I have my reasons.
- Suppose you share them with me.

23:41.550 --> 23:46.544
Look... Gold. An agent of the Bank
of Madrid is meeting us in a quiet inn.

23:46.630 --> 23:49.269
This goes to Spain.
For us, my love.

23:49.350 --> 23:51.784
I see.
How stupid of me.

23:51.870 --> 23:55.579
- A military guard would...
- Let Esteban know about this transaction.

23:55.670 --> 23:59.379
- Of course, he would have claimed his share.
- I'm afraid so.

24:02.870 --> 24:05.464
Don't move if you want to live.

24:13.230 --> 24:16.347
- A bandit.
- I have distressing news for you.

24:16.430 --> 24:18.898
I had a small drinking bout
with the agent of the Bank of Madrid.

24:18.990 --> 24:21.550
While in his cups,
the fellow was somewhat indiscreet.

24:21.630 --> 24:25.543
A drunken man is untrustworthy.
I will act for him. Hand it over.

24:31.110 --> 24:33.988
- And that little trinket.
- You would rob a woman?

24:34.070 --> 24:36.504
- I can't afford gallantries.
- I refuse. You dare not take it.

24:36.590 --> 24:40.185
Quickly. I should hate
to mark such a lovely cheek.

24:42.150 --> 24:46.462
This time I take only your money.
Next time...

26:24.070 --> 26:29.303
What a nice, quiet study, Your Excellency.
I like a quiet room. Very quiet.

26:30.910 --> 26:33.299
What do you want?

26:35.150 --> 26:39.826
A little talk with you, that's all -
if we come to an understanding.

26:39.910 --> 26:44.586
Do you think the climate in Spain
will agree with you?

26:44.670 --> 26:46.786
Why do you ask?

26:46.870 --> 26:50.749
Because you're either going there or
to some place you might not like so well.

26:50.830 --> 26:53.219
Which will it be?

26:54.270 --> 26:57.342
- Spain.
- It's a very wise choice.

26:58.030 --> 27:01.579
Now to the matter of your successor.
What do you think of Don Alejandro Vega?

27:01.670 --> 27:03.820
He's had experience.

27:03.910 --> 27:06.788
- What does it matter to me?
- Nothing.

27:06.870 --> 27:09.259
But to the people of this district, a great deal.

27:09.350 --> 27:12.148
When you resign, you'll appoint
Don Alejandro as your successor.

27:12.230 --> 27:14.460
As you wish.

27:20.950 --> 27:25.307
This will remind you that
I have been here once, and can return.

27:25.870 --> 27:29.260
- Close your eyes.
- What are you going to do?

27:43.430 --> 27:48.185
- What's that?
- The point of my sword against your throat.

27:48.270 --> 27:50.784
Don't move until I take it away.

27:50.870 --> 27:54.863
- What if I faint?
- You won't.

28:05.230 --> 28:09.109
What's this?
Are you trying to commit suicide?

28:09.190 --> 28:12.626
Speak up.
What's the matter?

28:19.390 --> 28:22.939
- He was here.
- Who was here?

28:26.150 --> 28:27.947
Ridiculous.

28:28.030 --> 28:32.069
- Your fears have addled your brain.
- I tell you, he was here. In this very room.

28:41.230 --> 28:44.222
- Anybody pass by this way?
- No one.

28:47.390 --> 28:50.348
- Has anyone entered this room?
- His Excellency and yourself.

28:50.430 --> 28:53.422
- Anyone else?
- No.

28:55.030 --> 28:59.820
Do you need any more proof?
You must have fallen asleep and dreamed it.

28:59.910 --> 29:02.504
Did I dream that?

29:07.790 --> 29:14.582
Sergeant, turn out the guard. Zorro is
somewhere on the grounds. Find him.

29:15.590 --> 29:17.421
I still can't believe the fellow was here.

29:17.510 --> 29:20.661
If you'd sat here with a sword at your throat,
perhaps you'd believe it.

29:20.750 --> 29:23.025
- How on earth did he get in?
- That's what I'd like to know.

29:23.110 --> 29:26.739
- And it's your business to find out.
- What did he say?

29:26.830 --> 29:30.823
He wants me in Spain
and Vega in my place.

29:33.950 --> 29:38.387
Now we have something.
This Zorro is a caballero.

29:38.470 --> 29:40.984
A ordinary brigand wouldn't
concern himself with Vega.

29:41.070 --> 29:45.586
- It would serve you right if I did go to Spain.
- And give up 50,000 pesos a year?

29:45.670 --> 29:49.026
I can't collect it if I'm dead.
And you get a third for protecting me.

29:49.110 --> 29:52.307
But what protection! You can't keep
even keep one mad dog off my neck.

29:52.390 --> 29:54.540
Can't I?
I'll find him, I promise you.

29:54.630 --> 29:57.940
In the meantime, I'll put a solid wall
of men around this house night and day.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.942
- I can't afford to lose you, my dear Luis.
- No, You can't.

30:01.030 --> 30:03.021
Your pickings end
if anything happens to me.

30:03.110 --> 30:06.500
That's exactly what I meant, Excellency.

30:27.230 --> 30:32.179
Blessed Mother, send someone
to take me from this dreary place.

30:32.270 --> 30:34.659
Someone I can love and respect.

30:35.910 --> 30:43.100
Let him be kind and brave.
And handsome, please, dear Mother.

31:03.710 --> 31:07.544
Fray Ramón, I didn't see you when I came in.

31:07.630 --> 31:11.543
I'm not Fray Ramón.
I'm Fray Pablo, from the mission.

31:11.630 --> 31:14.667
I've just been spending
the evening with Fray Ramón.

31:14.750 --> 31:21.462
Father, I was asking the Holy Mother
to save me from a convent.

31:21.550 --> 31:26.260
- Is that a sin?
- The sin would be in sending you to one.

31:26.350 --> 31:31.378
- I don't understand.
- Well, a young girl with your...

31:32.510 --> 31:38.221
I just think that you would probably be
more useful outside a convent than in.

31:38.310 --> 31:43.145
- You mean in serving God?
- Yes, in a way.

31:43.230 --> 31:45.266
In what way?

31:47.270 --> 31:52.742
Well, the Church must have sons
and daughters, if she is to flourish.

31:52.830 --> 31:56.618
- Do you follow me?
- I think so.

31:56.710 --> 32:00.180
- You mean that I might marry and...
- Yes, exactly.

32:00.270 --> 32:04.468
Strong sons and fine daughters
to the glory of God.

32:04.550 --> 32:08.304
I was praying just now for a husband.

32:08.390 --> 32:11.382
You were? Fine.

32:11.470 --> 32:14.826
I mean, it's quite natural
at your age, my child.

32:14.910 --> 32:21.099
Yes, but it's not natural for a girl of my age
to long for a husband to rescue her.

32:21.190 --> 32:24.023
- From what?
- Father...

32:24.790 --> 32:29.784
Will you sit here and talk to me
for a little while? I'm troubled, deeply.

32:37.070 --> 32:41.268
I want to leave this lonely place.
I want to meet young people.

32:41.350 --> 32:45.025
Girls of my own age.
No one ever comes here.

32:45.110 --> 32:47.943
The caballeros avoid this place
like the pest house.

32:48.030 --> 32:52.581
- Why?
- They hate my Uncle Luis.

32:52.670 --> 32:56.106
You know, I feel that
there's something wrong about him.

32:56.190 --> 32:59.023
Decidedly wrong.
What do you think?

32:59.110 --> 33:03.388
If people hate him as you say,
you have your answer there.

33:03.470 --> 33:08.669
Then I was right. Perhaps I should be glad
my Aunt Inez is sending me to a convent.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.059
No, don't be glad about that.

33:11.150 --> 33:16.065
I mean, probably your aunt feels that
that atmosphere is better for a young girl,

33:16.150 --> 33:18.869
- but I'm convinced...
- Inez? Oh, no.

33:18.950 --> 33:21.225
No. That's not why she's sending me.

33:23.070 --> 33:29.589
María says she's jealous.
She says it's because I'm good-looking.

33:29.670 --> 33:36.064
- María has excellent eyesight.
- Thank you, Father, but are you sure?

33:36.150 --> 33:38.903
No one except María ever says I'm pretty.

33:39.830 --> 33:45.780
Pretty? Why, you are more radiant,
more lovely than a morning in June.

33:46.350 --> 33:48.910
You really think that?

33:48.990 --> 33:53.780
- With all my heart.
- I've never heard such words before.

33:53.870 --> 33:56.509
They make me almost lose my breath.

33:57.670 --> 34:01.379
You should hear such words
every hour of the day.

34:01.470 --> 34:04.667
You're not in the least like Fray Ramón.

34:05.790 --> 34:08.588
You talk so strangely.

34:29.670 --> 34:34.585
You're not a padre. You're an impostor.
You're wearing a sword.

34:36.710 --> 34:38.860
We've been looking everywhere for you.

34:38.949 --> 34:41.543
Zorro broke into the house
and threatened your uncle.

34:41.630 --> 34:43.621
They think he's still hiding
somewhere close by.

34:43.710 --> 34:47.146
Come along. Lock the doors
after we leave, Fray Ramón.

34:47.230 --> 34:50.222
The beast may try to rob the altar.

34:51.150 --> 34:53.539
Good night, Padre.

35:28.550 --> 35:31.348
Padre, you dropped something.

35:41.510 --> 35:43.546
There he is.

36:10.550 --> 36:12.347
There.

38:06.790 --> 38:09.384
Three pesos.

38:12.550 --> 38:14.745
Three pesos.

38:21.390 --> 38:23.984
Four pesos.

38:32.990 --> 38:36.949
- Nine pesos.
- I cannot pay so much.

38:37.030 --> 38:39.305
I swear, it will leave me without a centavo.

38:41.190 --> 38:44.626
- Nine pesos.
- But we will starve.

38:44.710 --> 38:48.544
- How can I feed my family?
- Nine pesos.

38:48.630 --> 38:51.667
Please, I beg of you.
My little girl...

38:59.310 --> 39:01.505
That's all.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.228
I'll relieve you of that, Sergeant.

39:17.510 --> 39:19.899
I'll take that.

39:22.550 --> 39:24.347
Get back.

39:30.950 --> 39:33.145
After him.

41:00.630 --> 41:04.145
Hear our prayer.

41:04.550 --> 41:08.907
And drive far away from it...

41:08.990 --> 41:13.063
all the snares of the enemy.

41:13.150 --> 41:18.747
And let thy holy angels dwell therein...

41:18.830 --> 41:21.742
to keep us at peace.

41:21.830 --> 41:25.027
And may thy blessings...

41:25.110 --> 41:28.819
be upon us always.

42:17.630 --> 42:19.780
Good evening, Padre.

42:19.870 --> 42:24.022
It was so dull at home, and I remembered
that you played a fair game of chess.

42:24.110 --> 42:28.626
So I took the liberty of riding over
and setting up the men.

42:30.430 --> 42:32.785
What's the meaning of this?
How dare you?

42:32.870 --> 42:35.543
We are after Zorro.
We saw him ride toward the mission.

42:35.630 --> 42:38.508
Good evening, Sergeant.

42:38.590 --> 42:43.425
- Zorro, you say? What's he done now?
- Enough to get himself hanged.

42:43.510 --> 42:46.820
- Have you seen him?
- I have only this moment left the chapel.

42:47.790 --> 42:52.102
- How long have you been here?
- Some little time. It seems like hours.

42:52.190 --> 42:55.500
I've been waiting to play chess
with the good padre.

42:55.590 --> 42:59.708
- It's a dull game, but what can one do?
- You have seen or heard nothing?

42:59.790 --> 43:03.146
Of Zorro? Heaven spare me.
My blood chills at the thought.

43:03.670 --> 43:06.264
Out of here.
Search the grounds.

43:09.190 --> 43:12.944
What's disturbing you, Padre?
Thoughts of that bandit?

43:13.030 --> 43:16.989
- Puppy.
- Oh, my dear Padre, really.

43:17.070 --> 43:21.541
When I think of what one man, single-handed,
has accomplished against these devils,

43:21.630 --> 43:27.865
and see you, the last of the Vegas, trembling
at the very mention of his name, I could...

43:27.950 --> 43:30.066
Can't you even listen to me?

43:30.150 --> 43:34.109
Ordinarily, I'd drink in
every word you say, but just now...

43:36.630 --> 43:38.063
Thank you, Mother.

43:38.790 --> 43:41.543
- Quick. Hide this plunder.
- Plunder?

43:41.630 --> 43:45.020
Don't stand there gaping at me
like a fish. Put it away.

43:53.350 --> 43:57.389
- What is this?
- It's some of the alcalde's gold.

43:57.470 --> 44:01.782
And this I took from his charming wife.
It's pretty, don't you think?

44:02.870 --> 44:05.259
You took it?

44:06.270 --> 44:09.262
Have you seen this one, Padre?

44:14.270 --> 44:18.786
So my old mentor has no more wit
than the rest of them, eh?

44:18.870 --> 44:21.942
Are you trying to make me
the receiver of stolen goods?

44:22.030 --> 44:24.703
No, the dispenser.

44:24.790 --> 44:28.783
This gold was wrung from the peons.
It's up to us to restore it to them.

44:33.790 --> 44:36.179
My boy.

44:36.270 --> 44:40.741
My boy.
My Diego.

44:43.870 --> 44:46.987
Then you will lead your people
against these scorpions?

44:47.070 --> 44:52.064
No, we'd be no match for their trained
troops. My father was right about that.

44:52.150 --> 44:55.984
You must have had the alcalde at your mercy
when you took the gold from him.

44:56.070 --> 44:59.824
I would have snuffed him out like a candle.
God forgive me.

44:59.910 --> 45:03.505
It would accomplish nothing.
Anotherjust like him would take his place.

45:03.590 --> 45:05.740
I see.

45:05.830 --> 45:11.780
I see everything.
Diego, don't deceive your father any longer.

45:11.870 --> 45:16.739
- It's not fair to him.
- I don't like doing it. Believe me.

45:16.830 --> 45:18.821
But I must.

45:18.910 --> 45:22.903
My father is such a stickler for law and order,
that I'm afraid he might spoil all the fun.

45:22.990 --> 45:26.141
But what do you hope to achieve
all alone, taking his money?

45:26.230 --> 45:27.663
Oh, no.

45:27.750 --> 45:34.064
But I may be able to persuade him
to resign and name my father in his place.

45:34.150 --> 45:38.143
- Amusing, don't you think?
- If you live.

46:02.590 --> 46:08.028
Doña Inez begs you to make yourself
comfortable. She'll be down shortly.

46:08.110 --> 46:10.305
What's this?

46:10.390 --> 46:16.260
- Don Diego Vega.
- Oh, yes. What can I do for you?

46:16.350 --> 46:20.389
Have you forgotten that you urged me
to regard this house as still my home?

46:20.470 --> 46:21.983
Did I?

46:22.070 --> 46:26.063
It's very good of you to remember the offer,
but didn't you have trouble getting in?

46:26.150 --> 46:30.223
Oh, no. I had a note from Doña Inez
asking me to ride with her this morning,

46:30.310 --> 46:33.302
and I just showed it to the sentries.

46:35.830 --> 46:38.264
Excellent.

46:38.350 --> 46:41.262
Come into my study till my wife appears.

46:41.350 --> 46:45.343
It's been Esteban's privilege
to ride with her each morning.

46:50.550 --> 46:55.704
Why is this house so closely guarded?
I swear I saw a full company around it.

46:55.790 --> 46:59.749
- I wish there were twice as many.
- Their clatter would drive me to distraction.

46:59.830 --> 47:04.950
I find it reassuring.
Let me show you something, young man.

47:07.510 --> 47:09.501
Look.

47:10.710 --> 47:12.507
The mark of Zorro.

47:12.590 --> 47:16.583
He came here one night.
He threatened my life and left that.

47:18.950 --> 47:21.339
I should be petrified.

47:22.430 --> 47:24.660
He's mad, of course.
Quite mad.

47:24.750 --> 47:28.140
- You think so?
- Of course.

47:28.230 --> 47:31.905
There was a case in Madrid, almost identical.

47:31.990 --> 47:35.699
This fellow's mark was a cross.
He was a madman.

47:35.790 --> 47:38.509
Cunning beyond belief.
They always are.

47:38.590 --> 47:43.345
He killed 40 people.
Slit their throats from ear to ear.

47:43.430 --> 47:47.025
Warned them first, you know, and then...

47:48.590 --> 47:52.026
It's a pity your sense of duty keeps you here.

47:52.110 --> 47:55.500
- Frightful risk.
- Sense of duty?

47:55.590 --> 47:57.581
Yes, of course.

47:57.670 --> 48:02.266
I'm so sorry to have kept you.
Esteban was surly about our little ride.

48:02.350 --> 48:07.299
- I'd promised the morning to him, it seems.
- Your invitation was a smile from heaven.

48:07.390 --> 48:12.066
- I was positively suffocating with boredom.
- Then let's fly. I'm dying for a canter.

48:12.150 --> 48:14.710
Goodbye, Luis.
Don't work too hard.

48:14.790 --> 48:17.384
Goodbye, Excellency.

48:27.150 --> 48:33.498
Esteban, Vegajust told me a horrible tale
about a madman in Madrid, like this Zorro.

48:33.590 --> 48:37.742
- He thinks I risk my life by staying here.
- Forget your fears. I have a plan.

48:37.830 --> 48:40.060
Yes?
What is it?

48:40.150 --> 48:45.941
Don Alejandro is the leader of the caballeros.
Zorro wants you to appoint him in your place.

48:46.030 --> 48:49.818
- What do you gather from that?
- Go on.

48:49.910 --> 48:53.380
Doesn't it suggest to you that Zorro
is the tool of Don Alejandro?

48:53.470 --> 48:58.339
- Perhaps, but how can we prove it?
- We can at least help the situation.

48:58.430 --> 49:01.388
- How?
- Form an alliance with Don Alejandro.

49:01.470 --> 49:04.780
That's impossible.
You know Vega's attitude.

49:04.870 --> 49:08.749
Perfectly, but Lolita should have a husband.

49:08.830 --> 49:12.061
What could be stronger
than a matrimonial alliance?

49:12.150 --> 49:15.347
Royal families keep
the peace of Europe in bridal beds.

49:15.430 --> 49:17.625
Diego and Lolita.

49:18.590 --> 49:20.785
Not bad.

49:21.990 --> 49:24.458
Not bad at all.

49:28.510 --> 49:34.904
Diego, talking with you is like
a drink of cool water in the desert.

49:36.150 --> 49:39.301
- Oh, it's a pity.
- What?

49:39.390 --> 49:44.942
- I mustn't make you discontented.
- Oh, please. Of what were you thinking?

49:45.030 --> 49:47.419
I was just thinking
how you're being wasted here.

49:47.510 --> 49:51.219
Your beauty, your gift for words,
your perfect poise.

49:51.310 --> 49:56.100
You were born for something higher
and more civilised than this provincial life.

49:56.190 --> 49:58.260
I know.

49:58.350 --> 50:00.864
- May I tell you something?
- Anything.

50:00.950 --> 50:05.944
Yes, of course I may.
I felt from the moment we met that we...

50:08.830 --> 50:13.665
Esteban is urging me to leave
my husband and go to Spain with him.

50:13.750 --> 50:16.662
- Oh, but my dear, no.
- But I'm dying here.

50:16.750 --> 50:19.469
Go to Spain, but not with Esteban.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.347
With whom, then?

50:24.030 --> 50:27.500
- With your husband.
- My husband?

50:27.590 --> 50:31.549
- Go to romantic, beautiful Spain with Luis?
- Let me explain.

50:31.630 --> 50:36.226
As the wife of the one-time alcalde
of Los Angeles, you'd be received at court.

50:36.310 --> 50:41.020
But as the companion of a second-rate
soldier of fortune, you'd be ostracised.

50:41.110 --> 50:44.864
I see.
But Luis at court, imagine.

50:44.950 --> 50:48.659
In Spain the husbands of adorable ladies
are merely background.

50:48.750 --> 50:51.947
- I'd be lost among so many.
- Not you.

50:52.030 --> 50:55.625
You'd need only one "friend"
to introduce you into the proper circles.

50:55.710 --> 50:58.508
But I have no such friend in Madrid.

50:58.590 --> 51:02.583
Who knows? I don't intend
to remain in California for ever.

51:12.590 --> 51:18.859
- What you suggest is utterly impossible.
- I'll give a dowry of 20,000 pesos. 25,000.

51:18.950 --> 51:22.022
Are you buying my son, Señor Quintero?

51:22.110 --> 51:25.705
- There's the practical side to consider.
- It doesn't enter into this.

51:25.790 --> 51:29.544
You come here on a friendly mission
with half a company of troops. Why?

51:29.630 --> 51:32.940
Not to threaten you, Don Alejandro.
It's because of this Zorro.

51:33.030 --> 51:37.626
Zorro is only a symptom. This district
is bleeding under your vile administration.

51:37.710 --> 51:40.270
I would never appear to condone it
by marriage between our families.

51:40.350 --> 51:44.787
In that case, the friendly attitude
I've taken towards you, will cease.

51:45.870 --> 51:48.179
What is all this turmoil about?

51:48.270 --> 51:52.582
His Excellency has offered a marriage
between his niece Lolita and you.

51:52.670 --> 51:54.865
His niece?
How flattering.

51:54.950 --> 51:58.022
But why should that cause
an argument on a hot day like this?

51:58.110 --> 52:00.578
- Do I have to explain?
- Your father resents my efforts

52:00.670 --> 52:04.219
to make the people of the district
more industrious than under his regime.

52:04.310 --> 52:07.985
Grinding them into poverty and despair
to line your own pockets is hardly...

52:08.070 --> 52:11.460
Oh, politics, politics.
What have they to do with my marriage?

52:11.550 --> 52:15.702
- You'd marry into the family of this...?
- How can I tell until I've seen her?

52:15.790 --> 52:19.578
- She may look like her uncle.
- Quite right. I...

52:19.670 --> 52:25.142
Oh, no. She's a sweet little dove. It would
desolate us to have her leave the nest.

52:25.230 --> 52:27.505
If she were Venus,
she'd still be his niece.

52:27.590 --> 52:31.503
But, after all,
I'm not marrying His Excellency.

52:34.790 --> 52:39.306
Don't you think the wishes of your father
in this sort of matter should be considered?

52:39.390 --> 52:44.589
I had no say in my father's marriage.
Why should he try to instruct me in mine?

52:44.670 --> 52:48.026
Exactly.
Will you dine with us tonight?

52:48.110 --> 52:51.705
- Charmed.
- We'll expect you at eight o'clock.

52:55.750 --> 52:58.628
Diego, what have you done?

52:58.710 --> 53:00.587
It will be all right.

53:00.670 --> 53:05.266
No matter what you think now,
please don't worry.

53:18.910 --> 53:23.142
This was your doing, you sly beast.
You gave Luis the idea of this marriage.

53:23.230 --> 53:28.179
Alliances for the good of the state have
been fashionable since the dawn of history.

53:29.030 --> 53:34.104
- María, my knees are shaking.
- Yes, that is natural.

53:34.190 --> 53:40.709
- Shall I bow, or give him my hand to kiss?
- Both. First the hand, then the bow.

53:41.390 --> 53:46.305
It's 20 minutes past the hour.
What can be keeping him?

53:48.550 --> 53:52.259
Well, well, well.
Here you are at last.

53:52.350 --> 53:55.626
I was afraid that you might have been
waylaid by that Zorro fellow.

53:55.710 --> 53:58.588
Oh, heaven spare me.

53:59.590 --> 54:05.460
- I am dazzled.
- And here is our little dove, Lolita.

54:09.110 --> 54:11.749
- I am honoured.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

54:11.830 --> 54:15.618
May I present Señora María de López?

54:18.750 --> 54:23.062
You'll forgive me for being late.
They heated the water for my bath too early.

54:23.150 --> 54:29.544
It was positively tepid. By the time
more was carried and properly scented...

54:29.630 --> 54:33.418
Life can be trying, don't you think?

54:33.510 --> 54:35.944
- Oh, please.
- Courage.

54:36.030 --> 54:40.945
Well, shall we dine?
Come, Diego.

54:42.430 --> 54:44.739
His bath was tepid.

54:44.830 --> 54:48.618
Poor Lolita. I'm afraid
her wedded life will be the same.

54:57.030 --> 55:02.263
- Please do that again.
- As you wish. Observe closely.

55:07.550 --> 55:09.939
- Amazing.
- Quite simple.

55:10.510 --> 55:13.502
- Have you seen this one?
- No.

55:34.990 --> 55:37.788
Now, observe very closely.

55:40.630 --> 55:43.986
- Frightfully amusing.
- Yes, I did this one for His Majesty.

55:44.070 --> 55:49.269
- It must be heavenly at court.
- It's the one bearable spot on earth.

55:49.350 --> 55:53.468
Speaking of that Zorro, Excellency,
could you provide me with an escort home?

55:53.550 --> 55:58.340
On the way here, I fancied that cutthroat
lurking in every shadow. I was unnerved.

55:58.430 --> 56:00.819
How distressing.

56:01.910 --> 56:06.779
- You don't approve of my request.
- You called her hero a cutthroat.

56:07.790 --> 56:10.623
Have you met the fellow?

56:10.710 --> 56:15.659
I've never so much as seen his face.
I happen to admire courage.

56:15.750 --> 56:19.789
Dashing about with a cutlass has been
out of fashion since the Middle Ages.

56:19.870 --> 56:25.740
It seems to be quite effective. He is like
a lion among a lot of frightened sheep.

56:25.830 --> 56:28.708
A madman, that's what he is.

56:28.790 --> 56:30.781
Undoubtedly.

56:33.790 --> 56:38.181
Capitán, you seem to regard
that poor fruit as an enemy.

56:39.510 --> 56:41.705
A rival.

56:43.350 --> 56:46.626
My dear Esteban is for ever
thrusting at this and that.

56:46.710 --> 56:49.827
He used to be
a fencing instructor in Barcelona.

56:49.910 --> 56:52.265
How exhausting.

56:52.350 --> 56:55.262
- I didn't find it so.
- Then why did you give it up?

56:55.350 --> 57:00.185
- Unfortunately, I killed a man of influence.
- A lady was involved, I believe.

57:01.190 --> 57:04.500
The gentleman's wife, no doubt?

57:04.590 --> 57:07.866
Just how did you mean that?

57:07.950 --> 57:11.022
I'd hoped to be amusing.
Have I failed?

57:11.110 --> 57:12.862
Somewhat.
With me.

57:15.990 --> 57:20.700
What are the new dance steps?
You know them all, I suppose.

57:20.790 --> 57:23.782
- I'm afraid so.
- I would so love to have you show me.

57:23.870 --> 57:25.861
Gladly.

57:29.110 --> 57:32.989
- Inez would enjoy it more.
- Nonsense, my child. Dance with him.

57:39.710 --> 57:41.462
Play "El Sombrero Blanco".

59:03.190 --> 59:06.785
I never dreamed dancing
could be so wonderful.

59:08.110 --> 59:11.466
I found it rather fatiguing.

59:11.550 --> 59:15.543
- If you'll excuse me, I wish to retire.
- So sorry.

59:22.190 --> 59:25.580
- What's got into the girl?
- Who knows?

59:28.110 --> 59:31.102
- Our little dove has flown.
- I don't like it.

59:34.630 --> 59:37.508
You can't be serious about this marriage.

59:37.590 --> 59:39.308
But, my dear, it's perfect.

59:39.390 --> 59:43.941
You and I could be seen together anywhere
in Madrid without any danger of gossip.

59:46.030 --> 59:50.228
- Excellency, your niece is charming.
- A sweet child.

59:50.310 --> 59:53.985
May I plead with you
for her hand in marriage?

59:54.070 --> 59:56.504
A refusal would crush me.

59:56.590 --> 01:00:01.948
She's yours, my dear Diego,
with all my blessings.

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:50.221
Who's there?

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:58.908
- I have a confession to make.
- Please go. You'll be caught.

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:01.709
I must talk to you.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.587
Now, look here, my girl.

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:08.628
What do you mean by running away from the
man to whom I've promised you in marriage?

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:11.861
- You've done that without asking me?
- Of course.

01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:16.740
What do you know about such things?
And it's time that you understood that...

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:18.946
- Who's that?
- No one.

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:24.948
Forgive me, my dear.
I've been an old fool.

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:32.505
You seem to know how to handle these
matters much better than your Uncle Luis.

01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:36.783
You?

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:39.464
Don't come in here.

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:44.104
I have something important to say to you
and I don't want to be interrupted.

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:48.627
You, pretending to be Zorro.
I don't care to hear anything you have to say.

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:51.508
So unlock that door and go.

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:04.745
I'm glad to see you took the advice
I gave you in the chapel.

01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:08.823
About not hiding such beauty in a convent.

01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:11.299
What did you say?

01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:16.469
You're more lovely,
more radiant than a morning in June.

01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:19.348
Surely I must be dreaming.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.265
- You are Zorro.
- Yes, Lolita.

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:29.265
In order to accomplish what I set out to do,
I've had to deceive people, including you.

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:31.739
Yes, I see.

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:36.260
I understand.
You don't have to explain.

01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:39.422
You came here to tell me that asking
to marry me was just part of the game.

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:45.301
Oh, no. That's the one real thing
about this whole masquerade.

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:49.183
- Go quickly.
- Ride with me tomorrow.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:50.942
Yes, but go.

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:57.779
Be careful.

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:04.262
- Open the door.
- Yes, I'm coming.

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:13.184
You seem upset, my dear.
Have you been crying?

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:17.661
- Yes, I have.
- I understand.

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:24.702
This marriage was your uncle's idea.
He's not your type, and far too sophisticated.

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:27.941
- You really think so?
- Beyond a question.

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:33.068
I saw how he affected you tonight.
My heart bled for you, my dear.

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:37.268
When you tell Luis you'll have none of
this marriage, you'll have my full support.

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:42.219
I hardly know what to say.
Uncle Luis has done so much for me.

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:47.343
Nonsense. He has no right
to expect you to spoil your life.

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:51.899
Any marriage is better than none, I suppose.

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:55.665
Perhaps I could learn to tolerate Diego.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:58.742
I do so want to please Uncle Luis.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.622
There's such a thing
as carrying gratitude too far.

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:07.386
We can't ask you to spend your life
with a man you think repulsive.

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:11.306
We'll talk of this again in the morning.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.188
Good night, my dear.

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:35.467
Past midnight.
He's not home yet.

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:40.419
- How can you read?
- It's the latest European styles.

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:44.662
- Bustles are coming in, it seems.
- Bustles! What is a bustle?

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:48.026
It's something to build you up here.

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:51.898
Our only son
in the clutches of those polecats,

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:56.108
and you sit there
planning to decorate your...

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:03.820
There you are. Why didn't you spend
the entire night with your delightful friends?

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:07.664
What have you done about that girl?
Well, how did you get out of it?

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:11.459
She's perfectly charming.
A lovely, unspoiled child.

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:15.941
- You'll be delighted with her, Father.
- I will be delighted? What have you done?

01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:20.865
I've just taken the first steps
toward making you a grandfather.

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:23.460
What?

01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:26.189
What a son you bore me.

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:35.062
An alliance with those terrible people.
Why did you do it?

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:38.062
- For the best reason in the world.
- What is that?

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:40.744
- Lolita Quintero.
- She attracts you?

01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:46.382
- It's more than that. From the day I first saw...
- I thought you hadn't met her until tonight.

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:50.509
I did catch a glimpse of her
some time ago, and...

01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:54.902
You're concealing something from us.
I'm sure of it.

01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:57.982
- It's time you went to bed.
- Very well.

01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:01.267
But, Diego, tell me as soon as you can.

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:03.545
I will, Mother.

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:17.064
- What's the meaning of that?
- Gonzales was collecting taxes.

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:20.028
A priest resisted.
The fool gave him ten lashes.

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.499
- Send Gonzales to me.
- I wish I could.

01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:26.378
- What's to prevent it?
- The total disappearance of Gonzales.

01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:29.382
- He's gone? Where?
- To Hades, I hope.

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.620
I'll collect the taxes
myself from now on.

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:43.144
That should teach them.

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:51.221
What's that?

01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:54.261
You...

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.346
- What's that?
- Sergeant Gonzales. I think he's dead.

01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:00.386
Dead, you say?

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.508
- He's alive.
- He's got a Z on his chest.

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:21.740
José.
How is the little one?

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:26.779
She is well again.
I brought this to give thanks to the church.

01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:31.068
Give thanks in your heart.
Buy milk for the child with this.

01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:34.745
No. This is for the church.

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:08.989
I come at precisely
the right moment, it seems.

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:16.586
- I'll take that.
- These are the funds of the mission.

01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:19.901
Not any longer.
Hand them over.

01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:24.580
- I refuse.
- In that case, I shall take them.

01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:40.578
You should have been a soldier
rather than a churchman.

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:56.341
No wonder you chose the Church.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.545
- Where did you get this?
- I'll tell you nothing.

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:06.859
Run me through and have done with it.

01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:15.386
No, my dear Padre.
We shall presently hang you.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:26.426
For the last time. If you marry that girl,
you leave this house for ever.

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:29.263
It might be rather amusing
to live with the Quinteros.

01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:32.023
If I'd only left him in Spain.

01:09:32.109 --> 01:09:35.500
Wait till you see her.
She's just like this blossom.

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:38.582
I'll never see her.
I promise you that.

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:45.779
- We are not at home.
- I'm at home to the señorita. Show her in.

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:49.340
- So you defy me, too?
- You're not being sensible.

01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:54.420
- Father, this is Lolita.
- I am honoured.

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:57.104
And my mother.

01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:02.820
Please forgive me, but would it be
possible to see you alone for a moment?

01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:06.220
Señorita, will you answer me one question?

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:09.268
- Certainly.
- Do you want to marry my son?

01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:13.824
- Why, yes.
- Why?

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.698
Well, I love him.

01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:26.501
You are right, my son.
She is like the flower.

01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:35.385
Something terrible has happened.
They've arrested Fray Felipe.

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:39.224
They say he is Zorro
and they are going to hang him.

01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:43.701
- Where is he now?
- At the barracks. What can you do?

01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:47.699
I don't know yet.

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:56.179
So far I've only frightened your uncle.
This may mean I'll have to do more than that.

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:59.387
Do you understand?

01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:03.622
If that becomes necessary,
will it make any difference between us?

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:25.788
Sentries!
There's someone in that chair. Seize him.

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:32.418
Diego, what are you doing here?
You frightened me half out of my wits.

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:34.387
This is too much, really.

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:37.860
It's distressing enough to call on
my betrothed and not find her at home.

01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:42.262
- Now to be manhandled by these ruffians.
- Leave us.

01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:48.345
Where is Lolita?

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:52.503
Oh, riding, driving, walking.
What does a young girl do?

01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:55.309
Am I to understand
that my betrothed is allowed to

01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:58.382
wander about the countryside
without a duenna?

01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:01.667
I protest, Your Excellency.
I protest strongly.

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:04.742
I can't discuss that now.

01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:07.788
Do you know Zorro
had a priest for an accomplice?

01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:12.022
We arrested him today.
And another horrible thing happened to me.

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:14.829
Sergeant Gonzales
was beaten half to death by Zorro.

01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:17.299
He shoved him over the wall
right before my eyes.

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:20.143
How frightful.

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:25.388
But after all, it was harder on Gonzales.

01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.506
This is no time forjesting.

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:31.139
Perhaps, that madman is lurking
on the grounds right now.

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:42.940
What shall I do?
I offer rewards and nothing happens.

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:48.229
He may change his mind about you.
Those creatures usually do, I believe.

01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:50.824
He may decide to
cut the throat of someone else.

01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:55.938
- Must you always talk of throat-cutting?
- How thoughtless of me.

01:12:56.030 --> 01:13:00.820
- What you need is a drop of brandy.
- Yes, brandy...

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:07.543
It's gone. I'm surrounded by idiots.
Stupid servants, stupid soldiers.

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:13.147
I admire you tremendously.
Your courage, your fortitude.

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:17.143
Why, a weaker man would forget
his civic duty and get away from all this.

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.619
- You rang, Your Excellency?
- Yes, brandy.

01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:25.579
- On the desk, Your Excellency.
- It's not on the desk. Bring some.

01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:30.664
A situation of this sort would wreck
my constitution in a week.

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:33.867
But then I haven't the iron nerve
of Your Excellency.

01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:38.978
Your Excellency, come quickly.
Something has happened in the cellar.

01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:43.788
Guards.
You, follow me.

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:52.260
Look.

01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:55.069
Look, Your Excellency.

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:06.788
Here in the cellar, right below my study.

01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:08.542
Here's his trail.

01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:16.579
It goes this way.

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:22.859
It ends here.

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:29.389
He couldn't have gone through the wall.

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:34.180
He's not human. He's...
Light my way out of here. Quick!

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:51.346
You were right.
I'll leave this cursed place.

01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:55.901
I'll do as he asks.
Pen, paper...

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:04.106
A man should consider his wife.

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:09.503
Inez has gone crazy over the idea of Madrid.

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:13.788
She's been at me
night and day to take her there.

01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:21.179
This should do it.
This should suit that maniac.

01:15:22.190 --> 01:15:25.182
There, look it over.

01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:32.423
That's very direct.
But you forgot to sign.

01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:35.388
- Sign what?
- My resignation.

01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:38.621
Zorro will kill me if I stay.

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:42.988
You may escape him, but I will surely
kill you if you write any more of these.

01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:47.063
But I'm in grave danger.
Diego here will bear me out.

01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:52.019
You're in even greater danger than he thinks.
So you tried to get gold out of the country?

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:57.548
If you ever again take one peso of mine,
I'll cut your throat from ear to ear.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:01.589
I must ask you to change the subject.
He objects to talk of throat-cutting.

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:05.379
Quiet, you popinjay.
I've no reason for letting you live either.

01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:10.260
What a pleasant coincidence.
I feel exactly the same way about you.

01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:14.584
You wouldn't care to translate
that feeling into action, would you?

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:17.787
I might be tempted, if I had a weapon.

01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:19.869
Would you?

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:23.422
Now, please, gentlemen.

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:28.186
- This is going much too far.
- It's only to serve you, Excellency.

01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:31.865
You have a champion, Luis.
And what a champion.

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:50.469
I'll make it short, and save you fatigue.

01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:07.907
- Sentries!
- No interference, Excellency, please.

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:10.868
We have a hero with us.

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:29.304
- Are you all right, Diego?
- Ask the capitán.

01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:32.225
Get out.

01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:01.824
The fencing master has met his equal.

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:05.342
Careful.

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:09.821
- Are you tiring, Diego?
- No, Excellency, I'll take you on in a moment.

01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:24.021
- It's a good effort, capitán.
- My next will be better, my fancy clown.

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:53.146
- The capitán's blade is not so firm.
- Still firm enough to run you through.

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:06.743
I needed that scratch to awaken me.

01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:31.461
He's dead.
Well, he's been troublesome lately.

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:35.383
And you killed him.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:39.258
A secret stairway from the cellar.
We just discovered it.

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:43.309
A secret stairway?
Leading here?

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:50.341
Good. Very good.

01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:53.627
Excellent.
You shall be rewarded.

01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:56.099
Sentries!

01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:01.461
Keep that man covered.

01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:04.348
Take him to the guardhouse
and lock him in the cell.

01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:09.704
- The strongest cell you have.
- Why arrest me, Excellency?

01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:15.142
For three reasons. First, you have
mud from the cellar on your boots.

01:20:15.230 --> 01:20:18.745
Second, that secret stairway
happens to be in your old home.

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:22.869
And third, you handle a sword
like a devil from hell.

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:26.943
And that's exactly
where you're going, Señor Zorro.

01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:34.019
That's a pretty way to treat
your future nephew, Uncle Luis.

01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:37.898
No more of your wit.
Take him away.

01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:43.301
You, Morales...

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:51.499
Send the officer of the day to me. I want
all caballeros and peons summoned here.

01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:58.627
All caballeros are requested to report
at the alcalde's residence immediately.

01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:02.464
- At this hour? Ridiculous.
- The alcalde's orders.

01:21:03.190 --> 01:21:06.785
Sergeant, assemble your men
for firing-squad duty.

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.102
- But why did they arrest Diego?
- I don't know.

01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:14.865
Luis won't tell me.
He must have lost his mind.

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.347
Come in.

01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:22.705
His Excellency requests you ladies
to stay in your rooms tonight.

01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:27.068
- Why?
- I cannot say. I was ordered to tell you.

01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:33.382
Firing squad, forward.

01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:44.138
- Good evening.
- Why are we meeting here, Señor Vega?

01:21:44.230 --> 01:21:45.868
What do you know, Alejandro?

01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:48.669
Nothing. I was forced
to come here like the rest of you.

01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:50.342
They must be up to something.

01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:58.786
Good evening, señores.
It's a pleasure to see you here.

01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:02.146
Get to the point. Why have you
dragged us out of our homes at this hour?

01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:07.350
To witness a delightful spectacle.
You will find it particularly interesting.

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:09.705
I'm executing a caballero at midnight.

01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:12.421
- What caballero?
- Who is it?

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:17.265
The man you selected from among you
to defy me, to threaten my life.

01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:21.582
I brought you here to see him die
as a lesson to the lot of you.

01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:26.426
I, for one, don't know
what you're talking about.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.226
You almost convince me.

01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:33.063
Too bad you're about to lose
the best actor among you.

01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:36.460
But in a few moments,
you'll see your precious Zorro shot.

01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:44.861
Observe very closely.
Watch the candle.

01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:49.381
Blow.

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:57.379
You should really see something worthwhile,
like changing a copper coin into solid gold.

01:22:57.470 --> 01:23:00.223
- Can you do that?
- The good padre here has seen me do it.

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:04.747
- Many times.
- It was a secret discovered by Merlin.

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:09.620
It's been handed down through a long line
of sorcerers to some of us living today.

01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:12.980
You can change a centavo into gold?

01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:17.266
- Easily.
- Please, do that for me.

01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:20.588
I am very weary.
I must seek repose.

01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:26.461
I have a wife and seven children,
and the little I earn isn't enough for them.

01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:29.781
Please, make gold for them
and I'll pray for you.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:34.309
If I must, I must.

01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:37.828
Now, hold the centavo in your closed fist.

01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:43.065
Tightly now.
Put your fist well through the bars.

01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:48.463
Cold iron will spoil everything.
I take your fist gently, like this.

01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:51.860
Open the door.
Be quick about it.

01:23:55.910 --> 01:24:00.188
Get in. Get down under there,
close to the wall.

01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:02.659
And not a sound.

01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:10.828
Close the door.

01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:13.344
Hide this in your robe.

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:15.944
Sit down.

01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:23.022
And now, you will behold the result
of your rebellious plans. Come in.

01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:34.738
Here is Zorro the fox, safely trapped.

01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:36.946
Diego!
What is this?

01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:40.820
What idiotic joke is this?

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:44.186
- As if you didn't know.
- Luis Quintero, you are a fool.

01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:47.899
Zorro is a man. This is my worthless,
trick-playing offspring.

01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:51.061
Have you seen this one, Father?

01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:59.540
Help!
Zorro is loose.

01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:14.138
- Señores, are you with me?
- I am with you.

01:26:24.190 --> 01:26:26.499
God, forgive me.

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.866
God, forgive me.

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:26.946
What a splendid audience you have.
Peons, caballeros, everyone.

01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:30.067
- It was thoughtful of you to have them here.
- Luis, what's happened?

01:27:30.150 --> 01:27:33.460
Good evening, ladies. You're just in time.
His Excellency is about to make an address.

01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:36.383
Address? What shall I say?

01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:40.179
You know.
The little matter of your resignation.

01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:44.343
Quiet!
Quiet for His Excellency.

01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:49.342
We're waiting. Go on.

01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:55.826
Good people of Los Angeles,

01:27:55.910 --> 01:28:01.746
owing to my ceaseless efforts
to improve conditions in the district...

01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:06.582
my health is endangered.

01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:13.303
I have therefore decided
to give up my office and go to Spain.

01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:21.788
To succeed me as alcalde of this district,
I am naming my illustrious predecessor,

01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:24.862
Don Alejandro Vega.

01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:39.660
And now, Your Excellency, I personally will
accompany you to the wharf at San Pedro.

01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:45.939
I wish to bless your voyage, and ask God
to reward you according to your merits.

01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:50.425
Spain...
Spain!

01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:54.901
Diego, when may we expect you
and our dear little Lolita in Madrid?

01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:59.666
- We'll follow the customs of California.
- What do you mean?

01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:04.665
We are going to marry, and raise fat children
and watch our vineyards grow.

01:29:45.710 --> 01:29:48.702
