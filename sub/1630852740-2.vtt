00:07.250 --> 00:09.189
DR. DUBROW:

00:08.050 --> 00:09.189
Tonight, an exotic dancer

00:10.119 --> 00:11.080
who knows what she wants.

00:12.019 --> 00:14.189
This body is silicone

00:12.019 --> 00:14.189
or go home.

00:14.199 --> 00:16.170
I did my breasts and I did 800,

00:16.179 --> 00:18.109
but I need hella more.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.160
Well, how can you

00:18.120 --> 00:20.160
get bigger than 800ccs?

00:20.170 --> 00:22.179
You can make them.

00:22.260 --> 00:25.120
DR. DUBROW: And these two

00:22.260 --> 00:25.120
patients require Paul and I

00:25.129 --> 00:27.100
to get innovative in surgery.

00:27.109 --> 00:30.129
My left side

00:27.109 --> 00:30.129
looks like a big bull shark

00:30.140 --> 00:32.140
took a big old bite

00:30.140 --> 00:32.140
right out of it.

00:32.149 --> 00:34.200
When I breathe...

00:32.149 --> 00:34.200
[inhales]

00:34.259 --> 00:36.090
everything collapses.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.049
I don't wanna have no nose.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.049
This is probably

00:38.060 --> 00:40.049
in the top three

00:40.060 --> 00:42.130
messed-up tip cartilages

00:40.060 --> 00:42.130
that I've seen.

00:42.140 --> 00:44.119
- Look at that.

00:42.140 --> 00:44.119
- You can't just lift up

00:44.130 --> 00:46.009
the piece of fat

00:44.130 --> 00:46.009
and move it over.

00:46.020 --> 00:49.020
It has to have

00:46.020 --> 00:49.020
its own blood supply.

00:49.030 --> 00:51.109
I hope it works,

00:49.030 --> 00:51.109
and if it does,

00:51.119 --> 00:53.090
I'm a ----ing genius.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.159
DR. NASSIF: And Terry has

00:53.100 --> 00:55.159
one of the best results

00:55.170 --> 00:57.030
- I've ever seen.

00:55.170 --> 00:57.030
- This is

00:57.039 --> 00:58.200
in the top two results.

00:58.270 --> 01:00.159
- Oh, my gosh.

00:58.270 --> 01:00.159
- Look at that.

My name's Donnie,

01:24.180 --> 01:27.000
I'm 27 years old,

01:27.010 --> 01:30.099
and my left side

01:27.010 --> 01:30.099
looks like a big bull shark

01:30.109 --> 01:33.140
came up and just took a big

01:30.109 --> 01:33.140
old bite right out of it.

01:33.150 --> 01:35.069
My side's acting up again.

01:35.079 --> 01:37.090
Right now you can see

01:35.079 --> 01:37.090
where it's red and stuff

01:37.099 --> 01:38.219
- from the belt buckle.

01:37.099 --> 01:38.219
- Yeah.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.140
It looks like

01:38.280 --> 01:40.140
it's getting worse, Donnie.

01:40.150 --> 01:42.189
It's pretty painful,

01:40.150 --> 01:42.189
especially after going on

01:42.200 --> 01:44.140
an 8-hour a day, you know,

01:44.150 --> 01:46.120
It's almost unbearable,

01:44.150 --> 01:46.120
you know what I mean?

01:46.129 --> 01:49.090
But, try to find a way to cope

01:46.129 --> 01:49.090
with it and deal with it.

01:49.099 --> 01:51.069
As long back as I can remember,

01:51.079 --> 01:53.140
I was always shirtless

01:51.079 --> 01:53.140
and loved to be outdoors.

01:53.150 --> 01:56.069
I was an outgoing guy,

01:53.150 --> 01:56.069
social butterfly,

01:56.079 --> 01:57.189
half-naked, almost famous,

01:57.200 --> 01:59.150
all the time everywhere I went.

01:59.159 --> 02:01.219
So I went from being shirtless

01:59.159 --> 02:01.219
everywhere I went

02:01.290 --> 02:04.230
to no longer

02:01.290 --> 02:04.230
even being willing

02:04.239 --> 02:07.180
to go anywhere public

02:04.239 --> 02:07.180
without a shirt on.

02:07.189 --> 02:09.060
Do you remember the accident?

02:09.069 --> 02:11.099
Yeah.

02:09.069 --> 02:11.099
It was the worst day of my life,

02:11.110 --> 02:13.110
you know what I mean?

02:11.110 --> 02:13.110
My life changed just like that.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.219
Just overcorrected

02:14.289 --> 02:16.229
when I noticed my car

02:14.289 --> 02:16.229
going off the road,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.170
and barrel-rolled, flipped,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.170
and, you know,

02:19.180 --> 02:21.129
I--I don't even know

02:19.180 --> 02:21.129
what tagged my side

02:21.139 --> 02:23.139
or what did the damage.

02:21.139 --> 02:23.139
It was bad.

02:23.150 --> 02:25.180
I don't really remember

02:23.150 --> 02:25.180
everything exactly,

02:25.189 --> 02:27.180
but I just remember

02:25.189 --> 02:27.180
when I looked down,

02:27.189 --> 02:31.099
it reminded me of, like,

02:27.189 --> 02:31.099
seeing diamonds sparkling.

02:31.110 --> 02:34.159
There was so much glass

02:31.110 --> 02:34.159
and debris stuck in my side,

02:34.170 --> 02:36.199
and the blood

02:34.170 --> 02:36.199
obviously going down.

02:36.210 --> 02:38.219
It was pretty traumatic.

02:36.210 --> 02:38.219
I was in the hospital

02:38.229 --> 02:42.210
for two weeks with two different

02:38.229 --> 02:42.210
emergency surgeries.

02:42.219 --> 02:45.240
And I was told the surgery

02:42.219 --> 02:45.240
went extremely well,

02:45.250 --> 02:48.229
but I was left with a huge

02:45.250 --> 02:48.229
gaping hole in my side,

02:49.009 --> 02:50.240
and the doctor said

02:49.009 --> 02:50.240
that's pretty much

02:51.009 --> 02:53.110
how it was gonna be

02:51.009 --> 02:53.110
for the rest of my life,

02:53.120 --> 02:55.219
and said, you know,

02:53.120 --> 02:55.219
it's--it's like a shark bite,

02:55.229 --> 02:58.050
and tried to make me

02:55.229 --> 02:58.050
feel better about it,

02:58.060 --> 03:01.210
but, I mean, I--I was

02:58.060 --> 03:01.210
just completely shocked,

03:01.219 --> 03:05.050
and it was hard for me

03:01.219 --> 03:05.050
to even believe

03:05.060 --> 03:07.169
that they could leave

03:05.060 --> 03:07.169
somebody like that.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.219
The first time I had

03:07.180 --> 03:10.219
started to hook up

03:10.229 --> 03:14.169
with a woman after my accident,

03:10.229 --> 03:14.169
I took my shirt off.

03:14.180 --> 03:16.079
She immediately made a comment

03:16.090 --> 03:18.170
that she needed to go grab

03:16.090 --> 03:18.170
something out of her car,

03:18.180 --> 03:20.180
and never ended up coming back.

03:20.189 --> 03:23.199
And from that moment on,

03:23.210 --> 03:27.150
I think was when I lost

03:23.210 --> 03:27.150
a lot of confidence.

03:27.159 --> 03:28.219
I was...

03:31.270 --> 03:34.219
I was just broken

03:31.270 --> 03:34.219
and, you know,

03:34.229 --> 03:37.129
like, I'm never gonna be able

03:34.229 --> 03:37.129
to get a girlfriend again

03:37.139 --> 03:40.060
after this, and, you know,

03:40.069 --> 03:42.250
never gonna be able to do

03:40.069 --> 03:42.250
the things that I liked,

03:43.020 --> 03:45.039
you know, never be able

03:43.020 --> 03:45.039
to ride at the desert

03:45.050 --> 03:46.250
with my shirt off again,

03:45.050 --> 03:46.250
or, you know,

03:47.020 --> 03:49.150
just never be able

03:47.020 --> 03:49.150
to be in public,

03:49.159 --> 03:53.139
around other people, and,

03:49.159 --> 03:53.139
you know, be accepted.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.189
You're seeing

03:53.150 --> 03:55.189
the doctor here soon, right?

03:55.199 --> 03:58.180
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna see

03:55.199 --> 03:58.180
Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif.

03:58.189 --> 04:00.270
Hopefully they'll have

03:58.189 --> 04:00.270
some good news for me, you know,

04:00.280 --> 04:02.189
hopefully have an idea

04:00.280 --> 04:02.189
or something

04:02.199 --> 04:03.240
that'll work to fix this.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.270
My brother has

04:03.250 --> 04:05.270
the biggest heart

04:05.280 --> 04:08.139
and he's the most

04:05.280 --> 04:08.139
compassionate person I know.

04:08.150 --> 04:10.139
As a sister,

04:08.150 --> 04:10.139
it really hurts me

04:10.150 --> 04:13.129
because I just wanna be able

04:10.150 --> 04:13.129
to fix it for him and I can't.

04:13.139 --> 04:15.139
Did he tell you

04:13.139 --> 04:15.139
the shark bite story?

04:15.150 --> 04:17.129
He did tell me

04:15.150 --> 04:17.129
the shark bite story.

04:17.139 --> 04:19.040
- Bull shark.

04:17.139 --> 04:19.040
- [laughter]

04:25.069 --> 04:27.160
♪ I can do it better ♪

04:27.170 --> 04:30.079
My name is Chanel Ayana

04:27.170 --> 04:30.079
and I'm 29 years old.

04:30.089 --> 04:31.189
And for this body,

04:31.199 --> 04:34.139
it's silicone or go home.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.279
I'm not messing with no saline.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.279
It's not my thing,

04:37.040 --> 04:39.090
I don't like it.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.090
It just doesn't feel good.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.250
They're not so squishy.

04:40.259 --> 04:44.100
When I was in high school,

04:40.259 --> 04:44.100
I was very, very skinny,

04:44.110 --> 04:46.100
and I wanted to have

04:46.110 --> 04:48.079
that Coke bottle shape

04:48.090 --> 04:49.240
like all the other women had.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.250
So, of course,

04:49.250 --> 04:52.250
that is what made me say,

04:52.259 --> 04:54.250
"Okay, I'm gonna be

04:52.259 --> 04:54.250
super popping.

04:54.259 --> 04:56.100
"I'm gonna get this money.

04:56.110 --> 04:58.209
I'm gonna get this body."

04:58.220 --> 05:01.139
And every day,

04:58.220 --> 05:01.139
I will be walking past

05:01.149 --> 05:03.100
this club and I'm like,

05:03.110 --> 05:05.139
"Dang, what's going on

05:03.110 --> 05:05.139
in there?"

05:05.149 --> 05:07.199
These girls

05:05.149 --> 05:07.199
that are always coming outside

05:07.209 --> 05:10.079
are getting in these Mercedes

05:07.209 --> 05:10.079
and these nice cars.

05:10.089 --> 05:12.250
So I called and they told me,

05:12.259 --> 05:14.189
they're like,

05:12.259 --> 05:14.189
"When you turn 18,

05:14.199 --> 05:16.139
"you can show us what you got

05:16.149 --> 05:18.199
and if we like you,

05:16.149 --> 05:18.199
we'll offer you a job."

05:18.209 --> 05:21.120
So I get to the club at 11:30,

05:21.129 --> 05:24.069
it's about to be my 18th

05:21.129 --> 05:24.069
birthday in half an hour,

05:24.079 --> 05:26.240
and soon as the clock

05:24.079 --> 05:26.240
struck 12:00 AM,

05:26.250 --> 05:30.120
I went and I did my thing,

05:26.250 --> 05:30.120
and I got hired.

05:30.129 --> 05:34.189
Ever since then,

05:30.129 --> 05:34.189
I've just been an exotic dancer.

05:34.199 --> 05:36.149
So I made

05:34.199 --> 05:36.149
all this money on stage.

05:36.159 --> 05:39.000
I'm like, "Whoa,

05:36.159 --> 05:39.000
I'm ready to cash out."

05:39.009 --> 05:40.290
[laughs]

05:41.060 --> 05:43.240
For plastic surgery,

05:41.060 --> 05:43.240
I've traveled around the world,

05:43.250 --> 05:45.199
I had three nose jobs,

05:45.209 --> 05:47.159
three breast augmentations.

05:47.170 --> 05:49.110
I got an areola reduction,

05:49.120 --> 05:51.000
buccal fat removal,

05:51.009 --> 05:53.199
fat transfer,

05:51.009 --> 05:53.199
which everybody calls a BBL.

05:53.209 --> 05:55.209
I get Botox every three months,

05:55.220 --> 05:58.269
I get my lips done

05:55.220 --> 05:58.269
every four months or so.

05:58.279 --> 06:01.240
But right now,

05:58.279 --> 06:01.240
I'm unhappy with my breasts.

06:01.250 --> 06:04.250
My areolas are, like,

06:01.250 --> 06:04.250
two different shapes.

06:04.259 --> 06:07.149
And I want

06:04.259 --> 06:07.149
bigger silicone implants.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.269
Being an exotic dancer,

06:07.160 --> 06:09.269
that's what they're looking for.

06:09.279 --> 06:12.000
The bigger the boobs,

06:09.279 --> 06:12.000
the bigger the bank.

06:12.069 --> 06:14.269
But they don't make

06:12.069 --> 06:14.269
silicone implants bigger

06:14.279 --> 06:18.009
than the ones

06:14.279 --> 06:18.009
that I already have, 800ccs.

06:18.019 --> 06:21.220
So Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow,

06:18.019 --> 06:21.220
I'm on my way.

06:21.230 --> 06:24.220
I need you guys to do

06:21.230 --> 06:24.220
what y'all do best

06:24.230 --> 06:29.189
and create

06:24.230 --> 06:29.189
these 1,500cc silicone implants.

06:29.199 --> 06:32.189
[music]

06:34.209 --> 06:36.259
You know what they say

06:34.209 --> 06:36.259
and I've said this before,

06:36.269 --> 06:38.129
a picture is worth

06:36.269 --> 06:38.129
a thousand words?

06:38.139 --> 06:40.100
Look at this picture.

06:40.110 --> 06:42.120
This is Donnie.

06:40.110 --> 06:42.120
And voila,

06:42.129 --> 06:44.259
that is Donnie's left flank.

06:44.269 --> 06:46.180
That looks

06:44.269 --> 06:46.180
like a freaking shark bite.

06:46.189 --> 06:48.159
How are you gonna navigate

06:46.189 --> 06:48.159
your social life

06:48.170 --> 06:50.139
- with that thing?

06:48.170 --> 06:50.139
- You can't.

06:50.149 --> 06:52.180
And so let's call Donnie

06:50.149 --> 06:52.180
and see if we can help him.

06:52.189 --> 06:54.019
Can you please send in Donnie?

06:54.029 --> 06:56.120
- Donnie.

06:54.029 --> 06:56.120
- Hi, guys.

06:56.129 --> 06:58.100
- How are you?

06:56.129 --> 06:58.100
- Nice to meet you, Donnie.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.079
Good. How are you doing?

06:58.110 --> 06:59.079
Nice to meet you.

07:00.079 --> 07:02.009
I want to be happy again,

07:00.079 --> 07:02.009
how I used to be.

07:02.079 --> 07:04.230
If anybody could do it,

07:02.079 --> 07:04.230
these doctors could do it,

07:04.240 --> 07:07.189
and I think they're probably

07:04.240 --> 07:07.189
the only attempt

07:07.199 --> 07:10.189
I have to try

07:07.199 --> 07:10.189
to get my life back.

07:10.199 --> 07:13.240
We just saw

07:10.199 --> 07:13.240
a very dramatic picture.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.170
He thought it was a shark bite.

07:15.180 --> 07:17.170
- There's a--there's a story...

07:15.180 --> 07:17.170
- Neither.

07:17.180 --> 07:19.189
...that says it is a shark bite,

07:17.180 --> 07:19.189
you know, in Florida,

07:19.199 --> 07:21.139
- with a bull shark.

07:19.199 --> 07:21.139
- What did happen?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.149
- Tell us about it.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.149
- I was on my way to work,

07:23.160 --> 07:25.199
and I was trying to open

07:23.160 --> 07:25.199
a coffee bottle,

07:25.209 --> 07:27.029
took my eyes off

07:25.209 --> 07:27.029
the road for a second,

07:27.089 --> 07:28.240
and I hit the side of a hill

07:28.250 --> 07:30.250
- and it barrel-rolled my car.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.250
- Oh.

07:30.259 --> 07:32.279
And I tried to go out

07:30.259 --> 07:32.279
the driver's side door,

07:32.290 --> 07:35.250
but it had been crushed

07:32.290 --> 07:35.250
in the accident,

07:35.259 --> 07:37.139
so I couldn't open the door.

07:37.149 --> 07:40.120
That's called

07:37.149 --> 07:40.120
passenger space intrusion,

07:40.129 --> 07:43.120
where the entire

07:40.129 --> 07:43.120
passenger space collapses

07:43.129 --> 07:46.019
onto the passenger,

07:43.129 --> 07:46.019
whether you're a driver or not.

07:46.029 --> 07:48.170
And it brings the metal,

07:48.180 --> 07:52.029
the glass in with it

07:48.180 --> 07:52.029
and makes contact with you.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.000
- Right.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.000
- And takes up your space,

07:54.009 --> 07:56.189
- and it destroyed your side.

07:54.009 --> 07:56.189
- Right. Yeah.

07:56.199 --> 07:58.009
- No head injury, nothing?

07:56.199 --> 07:58.009
- Nothing.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.259
I walked out of it with this.

07:59.269 --> 08:01.240
They said that they needed

07:59.269 --> 08:01.240
to do a skin graft.

08:01.250 --> 08:04.240
They took skin from my left

08:01.250 --> 08:04.240
thigh, shaved it right there--

08:04.250 --> 08:07.259
and then when I initially

08:04.250 --> 08:07.259
saw it, I just cried.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.250
- How many years ago was this?

08:07.269 --> 08:09.250
- It was eight years ago.

08:09.259 --> 08:11.199
- How old were you?

08:09.259 --> 08:11.199
- Nineteen.

08:11.209 --> 08:13.290
- [exhales]

08:11.209 --> 08:13.290
- It's been a long eight years

08:14.000 --> 08:16.019
since all this has happened.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.019
I mean,

08:16.029 --> 08:18.259
it--it took me

08:16.029 --> 08:18.259
I would say, a good five years,

08:18.269 --> 08:21.250
just to finally be able

08:18.269 --> 08:21.250
to talk about it,

08:21.259 --> 08:24.259
and to joke about it

08:21.259 --> 08:24.259
and laugh about it, you know,

08:24.269 --> 08:27.009
and to be comfortable

08:24.269 --> 08:27.009
with it, and...

08:27.019 --> 08:29.009
But are you really comfortable

08:27.019 --> 08:29.009
with it?

08:29.019 --> 08:31.220
No. The few times

08:29.019 --> 08:31.220
that I have gone anywhere

08:31.230 --> 08:34.240
without my shirt on,

08:31.230 --> 08:34.240
I felt like a caged animal

08:34.250 --> 08:38.029
or I felt like it--like I was on

08:34.250 --> 08:38.029
an exhibit somewhere, you know?

08:38.110 --> 08:40.259
People staring,

08:38.110 --> 08:40.259
looking at me like I'm an alien.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.169
So then

08:40.269 --> 08:42.169
what happened in regards

08:42.179 --> 08:45.000
to your social life

08:42.179 --> 08:45.000
and your confidence?

08:45.009 --> 08:47.200
Yeah.

08:45.009 --> 08:47.200
I mean, as far as, like,

08:47.210 --> 08:49.039
hanging out

08:47.210 --> 08:49.039
with women and stuff,

08:49.049 --> 08:51.190
that was the immediately

08:49.049 --> 08:51.190
big change.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.039
I couldn't handle it anymore.

08:53.049 --> 08:55.200
I might be alone

08:53.049 --> 08:55.200
for the rest of my life.

08:55.210 --> 08:58.269
My brother was

08:55.210 --> 08:58.269
very carefree and very happy.

08:58.279 --> 09:01.240
Since the accident,

08:58.279 --> 09:01.240
I see him hold back

09:01.250 --> 09:04.169
a little bit more

09:01.250 --> 09:04.169
and just not live life

09:04.179 --> 09:06.009
to the fullest like he used to.

09:06.019 --> 09:08.009
The accident

09:06.019 --> 09:08.009
was extremely hard.

09:08.019 --> 09:09.259
We almost did lose him

09:09.269 --> 09:13.029
and I do hope the doctors

09:13.039 --> 09:15.220
can fix his side

09:13.039 --> 09:15.220
and give him that life back.

09:15.230 --> 09:18.279
Well, it's a complicated

09:15.230 --> 09:18.279
problem that's--

09:18.289 --> 09:22.000
I'm sort of having difficulty

09:18.289 --> 09:22.000
wrapping my brain around.

09:22.009 --> 09:25.029
And even if you're able

09:22.009 --> 09:25.029
to fix the left side,

09:25.039 --> 09:27.049
what is it gonna look

09:25.039 --> 09:27.049
like relative to the right side?

09:27.059 --> 09:28.269
- Right. Exactly.

09:27.059 --> 09:28.269
- Do we need to do

09:28.279 --> 09:30.029
something to the right side?

09:30.039 --> 09:32.279
You just innately know--

09:32.289 --> 09:34.279
that this is

09:32.289 --> 09:34.279
a complicated problem.

09:34.289 --> 09:36.029
- Yeah.

09:39.129 --> 09:40.259
Some people,

09:39.129 --> 09:40.259
they might say,

09:40.269 --> 09:43.009
"Oh, ew, I don't like

09:40.269 --> 09:43.009
how that looks."

09:43.019 --> 09:45.149
But this body is paid in full

09:45.159 --> 09:47.200
and it brings in

09:45.159 --> 09:47.200
the profits, period.

09:47.210 --> 09:49.250
So when I went in

09:47.210 --> 09:49.250
for that next surgery...

09:49.259 --> 09:51.059
- The second was--

09:49.259 --> 09:51.059
- For the second one, I'm awake.

09:51.129 --> 09:53.029
He immediately gets the knife

09:53.039 --> 09:54.259
and starts cutting.

09:53.039 --> 09:54.259
I'm like,

09:54.269 --> 09:56.059
"Oh, I can feel that."

09:54.269 --> 09:56.059
And he's like, "Shut up,

09:56.129 --> 09:57.190
you cannot feel that."

09:57.200 --> 09:59.070
A doctor told you to shut up?

09:59.129 --> 10:00.220
Yes. Most definitely.

10:04.039 --> 10:06.049
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

10:07.029 --> 10:08.289
Donnie,

10:07.029 --> 10:08.289
let's look at this shark bite.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
So the question is,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
what's missing?

10:12.009 --> 10:15.179
So basically, you have

10:12.009 --> 10:15.179
some remnant of muscle here.

10:15.190 --> 10:18.070
You have nothing right here.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.070
It's pure skin graft on bone.

10:21.149 --> 10:24.179
You have some remnants

10:21.149 --> 10:24.179
of soft tissue here.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.019
Even if I could

10:24.190 --> 10:27.019
sort of make this look

10:27.029 --> 10:30.159
- normal or normal-ish...

10:27.029 --> 10:30.159
- Uh-huh.

10:30.169 --> 10:32.190
...is it gonna look

10:30.169 --> 10:32.190
like this side?

10:32.200 --> 10:36.000
Donnie's anatomical situation

10:32.200 --> 10:36.000
is actually very complex

10:36.009 --> 10:39.000
and I won't know

10:36.009 --> 10:39.000
what the anatomy is

10:39.009 --> 10:41.070
until I get in there,

10:39.009 --> 10:41.070
remove the skin graft,

10:41.129 --> 10:44.169
and figure out

10:41.129 --> 10:44.169
where the tissue is,

10:44.179 --> 10:47.190
what it's composed of

10:44.179 --> 10:47.190
and how to bring it together

10:47.200 --> 10:50.289
to give him a reasonable

10:47.200 --> 10:50.289
symmetrical result.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.230
The simplest option is just

10:51.000 --> 10:54.230
to take the skin graft off...

10:54.240 --> 10:56.200
- Mm-hmm.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.200
- ...and try to bring

10:56.210 --> 10:58.019
the skin edges together.

10:58.029 --> 11:00.220
Okay?

10:58.029 --> 11:00.220
But it'll be tight.

11:00.230 --> 11:02.220
You'll still have it

11:00.230 --> 11:02.220
go in a little bit...

11:02.230 --> 11:04.220
- Mm-hmm.

11:02.230 --> 11:04.220
- ...and it'll look

11:04.230 --> 11:06.169
very different

11:04.230 --> 11:06.169
than the other side.

11:06.179 --> 11:10.090
And then another option is to

11:10.179 --> 11:11.220
make an incision across

11:11.230 --> 11:13.080
your entire abdominal wall,

11:13.090 --> 11:15.210
extending into

11:13.090 --> 11:15.210
the unaffected right side.

11:15.220 --> 11:18.220
It'll have a better shot

11:15.220 --> 11:18.220
at matching the left side.

11:18.230 --> 11:21.269
- Right.

11:18.230 --> 11:21.269
- The advantage of that is

11:21.279 --> 11:23.200
you probably

11:21.279 --> 11:23.200
don't love this little...

11:23.210 --> 11:25.200
- Yeah. No, no.

11:23.210 --> 11:25.200
- ...extra lax tissue.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.190
- It's a tummy tuck on a guy.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.190
- Okay.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.210
The big downside

11:27.200 --> 11:29.210
is complications.

11:29.220 --> 11:31.210
I mean,

11:29.220 --> 11:31.210
there's a big difference

11:31.220 --> 11:33.289
between working

11:31.220 --> 11:33.289
on this smaller area,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.250
although substantial area,

11:35.259 --> 11:39.009
than lifting everything up,

11:39.019 --> 11:40.200
doing a full tummy tuck.

11:40.210 --> 11:42.259
But I'm willing to go after it

11:42.269 --> 11:44.230
if you're willing

11:42.269 --> 11:44.230
to go after it.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.019
If you wanna

11:44.240 --> 11:47.019
do the whole thing...

11:47.029 --> 11:48.289
- Yeah.

11:47.029 --> 11:48.289
- ...I'm there for you.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.090
- I'll do the whole thing.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.090
- I think the best option

11:51.149 --> 11:53.210
sounds like, you know,

11:51.149 --> 11:53.210
even though it's a bigger risk,

11:53.220 --> 11:55.240
probably do the whole thing

11:53.220 --> 11:55.240
and try to make it

11:55.250 --> 11:57.080
look as symmetric as we can.

11:57.090 --> 11:58.279
Well, with everything

11:57.090 --> 11:58.279
that I've been through,

11:58.289 --> 12:00.250
I think

11:58.289 --> 12:00.250
the excitement of

12:00.259 --> 12:03.070
what could possibly be

12:00.259 --> 12:03.070
in the future

12:03.080 --> 12:05.019
outweighs the negative.

12:05.029 --> 12:07.080
This could really be

12:05.029 --> 12:07.080
something great for me.

12:07.149 --> 12:08.240
- Let's do it.

12:07.149 --> 12:08.240
- Let's do this thing.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.009
- Let's do it.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.070
I was already getting bullied

12:32.000 --> 12:34.070
about my nose.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.090
I had a pretty

12:34.080 --> 12:37.090
good-sized hump here

12:37.159 --> 12:39.259
and I had a golf ball

12:37.159 --> 12:39.259
on the end of my nose.

12:39.269 --> 12:43.000
I was absolutely going

12:39.269 --> 12:43.000
to get a nose job when I was 18.

12:43.009 --> 12:44.279
But unfortunately,

12:43.009 --> 12:44.279
after two surgeries,

12:44.289 --> 12:47.100
my nose is hideous,

12:44.289 --> 12:47.100
and I can't breathe.

12:47.159 --> 12:49.029
It's frustrating,

12:47.159 --> 12:49.029
and it's overwhelming,

12:49.039 --> 12:51.269
and I'm--I'm

12:49.039 --> 12:51.269
fricking over it.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.049
[sniffles]

12:55.250 --> 12:58.049
- Babe?

12:55.250 --> 12:58.049
- [cries]

12:58.059 --> 13:00.100
- Are you doing all right?

12:58.059 --> 13:00.100
- Lisa: It's just a bad day.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.110
- Every day.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.110
- I understand

13:02.120 --> 13:04.080
that the cosmetic part is huge,

13:04.090 --> 13:06.080
but for me,

13:04.090 --> 13:06.080
seeing her struggle to breathe

13:06.090 --> 13:07.220
has been very difficult.

13:07.230 --> 13:09.039
She's been to a lot of doctors

13:09.049 --> 13:11.110
and it--it's painful,

13:09.049 --> 13:11.110
physically,

13:11.120 --> 13:13.279
and it--and it's painful,

13:11.120 --> 13:13.279
emotional for her.

13:13.289 --> 13:16.129
I just don't even know

13:13.289 --> 13:16.129
if Dr. Nassif can fix it.

13:16.139 --> 13:19.110
I mean, I don't know

13:16.139 --> 13:19.110
if it's too far gone for him

13:19.120 --> 13:23.100
or if I'm a lost cause.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.100
I don't know.

13:23.110 --> 13:26.100
I'm just ready

13:23.110 --> 13:26.100
to have a doctor

13:26.110 --> 13:29.029
that I feel confident with say,

13:26.110 --> 13:29.029
"We got this."

13:29.039 --> 13:30.120
Hello, how are you?

13:30.129 --> 13:32.009
- Dr. Nassif.

13:30.129 --> 13:32.009
- Yes. Terry Dubrow.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.039
He never introduces himself

13:32.019 --> 13:34.039
as Dr. Dubrow.

13:34.049 --> 13:35.120
- Because--

13:34.049 --> 13:35.120
- Well, he earned it,

13:35.179 --> 13:36.200
but he just--

13:35.179 --> 13:36.200
you know, he doesn't do it.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.019
Because, you know,

13:37.200 --> 13:40.019
Superman doesn't say, "Hi,

13:40.029 --> 13:42.090
- I have superpowers."

13:40.029 --> 13:42.090
- [laughs]

13:42.100 --> 13:45.039
So what age did you

13:42.100 --> 13:45.039
get your first nose surgery?

13:45.049 --> 13:47.080
When I was 18,

13:45.049 --> 13:47.080
so 28 years ago.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.230
What did your nose look like?

13:48.240 --> 13:51.090
So I had a nice

13:48.240 --> 13:51.090
little bump right here,

13:51.100 --> 13:53.049
and I had

13:51.100 --> 13:53.049
a golf ball on the end.

13:53.059 --> 13:54.269
- What happened?

13:53.059 --> 13:54.269
- So after the first surgery,

13:54.279 --> 13:56.129
the hump was gone,

13:56.190 --> 13:58.259
and a majority

13:56.190 --> 13:58.259
of this ball was gone.

13:58.269 --> 14:00.090
After the three months,

13:58.269 --> 14:00.090
when the swelling

14:00.100 --> 14:02.019
- goes down, basically.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.019
- Right.

14:02.029 --> 14:03.259
What did you

14:02.029 --> 14:03.259
actually start seeing?

14:03.269 --> 14:05.289
So this started to drop,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.070
and then there was something

14:06.000 --> 14:09.070
right here.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.120
We needed to wait

14:09.080 --> 14:11.120
till at least six months

14:11.129 --> 14:14.059
before he would go in

14:11.129 --> 14:14.059
and do any sort of a revision.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.279
So when I went in

14:14.070 --> 14:15.279
for that next surgery,

14:15.289 --> 14:17.139
he's like, "Okay,

14:15.289 --> 14:17.139
lay down on the table."

14:17.220 --> 14:19.049
- You're awake? You're awake?

14:17.220 --> 14:19.049
- And I'm--I'm like--

14:19.059 --> 14:20.259
- I was totally awake.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.259
- Were you awake

14:20.269 --> 14:22.009
- for the first one?

14:20.269 --> 14:22.009
- I was--I was not.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.019
- So the second was--

14:23.070 --> 14:24.019
- But the second one, I'm awake.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.250
Like, you're awake,

14:24.029 --> 14:25.250
just numb you up.

14:25.259 --> 14:28.009
As they're numbing,

14:25.259 --> 14:28.009
he immediately hands--

14:28.019 --> 14:30.120
gets the knife

14:28.019 --> 14:30.120
and starts cutting.

14:30.129 --> 14:31.289
And I'm like,

14:30.129 --> 14:31.289
"Oh, I can feel that."

14:32.000 --> 14:33.279
And he's like,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.279
"Shut up, you cannot feel that."

14:33.289 --> 14:35.269
- He said shut up?

14:33.289 --> 14:35.269
- He did.

14:35.279 --> 14:37.269
- He said the words "shut up"?

14:35.279 --> 14:37.269
- He did.

14:37.279 --> 14:39.029
- You're sure?

14:37.279 --> 14:39.029
- Yeah, oh, yeah. I'm positive.

14:39.039 --> 14:40.139
A doctor told you to shut up?

14:40.200 --> 14:42.059
- Lisa: Yes. Most definitely.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.059
- Wow.

14:42.070 --> 14:43.259
So how's your breathing?

14:42.070 --> 14:43.259
How's all that?

14:43.269 --> 14:46.250
My breathing is horrible.

14:43.269 --> 14:46.250
I have to wear nose strips

14:46.259 --> 14:48.100
- almost every night.

14:46.259 --> 14:48.100
- Oh, yeah.

14:48.110 --> 14:50.240
Why has it been 28 years?

14:48.110 --> 14:50.240
I mean, why now?

14:50.250 --> 14:52.019
All of a sudden

14:50.250 --> 14:52.019
you're showing up here.

14:52.029 --> 14:54.000
I was diagnosed with lupus.

14:54.009 --> 14:56.009
Thankfully, I'm in remission

14:54.009 --> 14:56.009
right now, so yeah.

14:56.019 --> 14:58.120
- Yeah. Great.

14:56.019 --> 14:58.120
- Next month will be a year.

14:58.129 --> 15:00.120
In the most basic terms,

15:00.129 --> 15:03.149
lupus is your own body

15:00.129 --> 15:03.149
attacking itself.

15:03.210 --> 15:06.159
If I don't do this now

15:03.210 --> 15:06.159
while my lupus

15:06.169 --> 15:08.090
is a little bit in remission,

15:08.100 --> 15:09.289
I'm gonna lose this window.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.149
It's good that you waited,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.149
especially

15:11.159 --> 15:13.100
- for the healing aspects of it.

15:11.159 --> 15:13.100
- Right.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.269
It's really important

15:13.110 --> 15:15.269
for Lisa to be in remission

15:15.279 --> 15:18.139
from lupus because

15:15.279 --> 15:18.139
if you cause it again--

15:18.149 --> 15:21.049
and maybe the insult

15:18.149 --> 15:21.049
from surgery may do that--

15:21.059 --> 15:23.059
you have

15:21.059 --> 15:23.059
this auto-inflammation,

15:23.070 --> 15:25.070
the body attacks itself.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.250
And that could one, cause her

15:26.259 --> 15:29.110
a complete systemic reaction

15:26.259 --> 15:29.110
to the lupus

15:29.120 --> 15:32.029
or somehow it can cause

15:29.120 --> 15:32.029
problems healing with the nose.

15:32.039 --> 15:33.139
Besides the breathing presently,

15:33.149 --> 15:36.090
does the cosmetic aspects

15:33.149 --> 15:36.090
do anything now to you?

15:36.100 --> 15:38.039
I don't want

15:36.100 --> 15:38.039
these humps here,

15:38.049 --> 15:41.009
especially this huge one.

15:41.019 --> 15:43.009
She'd like

15:41.019 --> 15:43.009
a symmetrical nose.

15:43.019 --> 15:45.019
Actually,

15:43.019 --> 15:45.019
I went to another consultation,

15:45.029 --> 15:46.149
a couple,

15:45.029 --> 15:46.149
and one of them told me

15:46.159 --> 15:48.019
I get one more chance.

15:48.029 --> 15:50.159
- Yeah.

15:48.029 --> 15:50.159
- And it--

15:50.169 --> 15:52.159
So the doctors said

15:50.169 --> 15:52.159
that you have one chance

15:52.220 --> 15:54.080
and that's it?

15:54.090 --> 15:56.029
They're worried

15:54.090 --> 15:56.029
about blood supply.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.090
I don't want to have no nose.

16:01.289 --> 16:03.149
I'm sorry to get into this,

16:03.220 --> 16:05.090
but I got to talk

16:03.220 --> 16:05.090
to you about the lupus.

16:05.100 --> 16:09.049
There's always that small chance

16:05.100 --> 16:09.049
that it could ignite.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.029
Now we're gonna elevate up

16:12.039 --> 16:14.000
the surrounding tissue

16:12.039 --> 16:14.000
to see what we have.

16:14.009 --> 16:15.129
Sometimes you have

16:14.009 --> 16:15.129
to make up procedures

16:15.139 --> 16:19.159
in plastic surgery based

16:15.139 --> 16:19.159
on well-founded principles.

16:19.169 --> 16:22.169
The big question is:

16:19.169 --> 16:22.169
will this fat survive?

16:26.059 --> 16:27.289
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

16:28.250 --> 16:29.279
I just hope

16:28.250 --> 16:29.279
that they can fix it.

16:30.279 --> 16:31.279
What if they can't fix it

16:30.279 --> 16:31.279
because I have lupus

16:32.269 --> 16:34.049
even though I'm in remission?

16:32.269 --> 16:34.049
It's scary,

16:35.120 --> 16:36.139
because with my nose collapsing

16:35.120 --> 16:36.139
the way that it does,

16:37.129 --> 16:39.049
I feel like if we don't do

16:37.129 --> 16:39.049
something soon,

16:39.059 --> 16:41.149
it's just only going

16:39.059 --> 16:41.149
to get worse.

16:41.159 --> 16:43.059
Lower your chin

16:41.159 --> 16:43.059
just a little bit.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.110
So right here,

16:43.070 --> 16:45.110
you're collapsed.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.169
So this is what we call

16:45.120 --> 16:47.169
the tip cartilage.

16:47.179 --> 16:48.279
- Mm-hmm.

16:47.179 --> 16:48.279
- And it's more prominent

16:48.289 --> 16:50.110
because you're caved in

16:48.289 --> 16:50.110
above it.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.080
And then you have really,

16:50.120 --> 16:52.080
really thin skin.

16:52.090 --> 16:53.179
- Yeah.

16:52.090 --> 16:53.179
- The cartilage there

16:53.269 --> 16:56.029
is deformed a little bit

16:53.269 --> 16:56.029
and she's also--

16:56.039 --> 16:57.190
her medial crural

16:56.039 --> 16:57.190
is hanging right here,

16:57.200 --> 16:59.019
because she's overprojected.

16:59.029 --> 17:01.100
Head back. Breathe in.

17:01.110 --> 17:03.149
Ooh, boy.

17:01.110 --> 17:03.149
That's a good party trick.

17:03.159 --> 17:06.099
So you--so you really have

17:03.159 --> 17:06.099
no support there at all.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.089
No.

17:08.099 --> 17:09.160
So you need structure.

17:09.170 --> 17:11.289
Looking at Lisa's nose,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.150
it's exactly what I thought

17:12.000 --> 17:14.150
from sitting across from her.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.069
Her nose is devastated.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.130
First of all, from

17:17.079 --> 17:19.130
the "functional" breathing side,

17:19.140 --> 17:21.180
we're gonna fix your septum

17:19.140 --> 17:21.180
and reconstruct

17:21.190 --> 17:24.089
and add support to what we call

17:21.190 --> 17:24.089
the external valve.

17:24.099 --> 17:26.170
- Right.

17:24.099 --> 17:26.170
- I'm sorry to get into this

17:26.180 --> 17:28.119
but I got to talk to you

17:26.180 --> 17:28.119
about the lupus.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.039
Right now,

17:28.130 --> 17:30.039
you're in remission.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.200
There's always that small chance

17:32.210 --> 17:35.160
that it could ignite

17:32.210 --> 17:35.160
just because of anesthesia

17:35.170 --> 17:38.000
or insulting your body

17:35.170 --> 17:38.000
and that could affect

17:38.009 --> 17:39.190
your healing

17:38.009 --> 17:39.190
and make you sick again.

17:39.269 --> 17:41.079
There's always

17:39.269 --> 17:41.079
that small chance.

17:41.089 --> 17:43.009
- Okay.

17:41.089 --> 17:43.009
- But of course,

17:43.019 --> 17:45.130
if anything like that happens,

17:43.019 --> 17:45.130
we will address it.

17:45.140 --> 17:47.069
I'm just over this sh--.

17:47.079 --> 17:48.200
Not being able to breathe.

17:48.210 --> 17:50.079
I'm tired of my health issues.

17:50.089 --> 17:52.180
I just want my nose back.

17:52.190 --> 17:54.180
So you have to let us know

17:52.190 --> 17:54.180
if you want to proceed.

17:54.190 --> 17:56.140
I do. Thank you.

17:56.150 --> 17:58.029
Get ready for this.

17:58.039 --> 17:59.089
- Thank you, guys.

17:58.039 --> 17:59.089

being an exotic dancer.

18:11.079 --> 18:13.000
and as a model

18:11.079 --> 18:13.000

18:13.009 --> 18:14.170
I'mma take this video.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.059

18:16.069 --> 18:17.150
- Right.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.009
I started doing Instagram

18:19.019 --> 18:20.180
before it was,

18:19.019 --> 18:20.180
like, the thing to do.

18:20.190 --> 18:22.119
Some people, they might say,

18:20.190 --> 18:22.119
"Oh, ew,

18:22.130 --> 18:23.180
I don't like how that looks."

18:23.190 --> 18:26.109

18:32.230 --> 18:34.109

18:32.230 --> 18:34.109
- Show me.

18:34.119 --> 18:35.210

There's this selfie

18:36.000 --> 18:38.039

18:38.049 --> 18:40.009
It's called--

18:38.049 --> 18:40.009
I call it the butt selfie.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.029
I mean, it's pretty

18:40.019 --> 18:42.029
self-explanatory.

18:42.039 --> 18:45.069
You put the phone on the floor

18:42.039 --> 18:45.069
and you stand over it.

18:45.079 --> 18:47.220
It gives, like, this crazy angle

18:47.230 --> 18:50.009
as if, like,

18:47.230 --> 18:50.009
someone's laying down

18:50.019 --> 18:53.180
and looking up and your butt

18:50.019 --> 18:53.180
is just massive. [laughs]

18:53.190 --> 18:56.019
Oh my God,

18:53.190 --> 18:56.019
this looks so good.

18:56.029 --> 18:57.140
And it gets a lot of views.

18:57.150 --> 19:00.019
Major. It goes viral.

19:00.029 --> 19:02.049
I feel like they don't even care

19:00.029 --> 19:02.049
about my face anymore.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.210
- No, they don't care.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.210
- I post a picture of my selfie.

19:03.220 --> 19:05.210
They're always like,

19:03.220 --> 19:05.210
"Bitch, show your ass again."

19:08.130 --> 19:09.200
- Like, it's good money.

19:08.130 --> 19:09.200
- Yeah, I always make a big bag

19:09.210 --> 19:11.150
when I'm making content

19:09.210 --> 19:11.150
with Chanel,

19:11.160 --> 19:13.059

19:11.160 --> 19:13.059
- And she's crazy

Yeah. Positive energy only.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.200
- Nervous?

19:34.210 --> 19:37.119
I chose

19:34.210 --> 19:37.119
the riskiest operation.

19:37.130 --> 19:40.119
And at first,

19:37.130 --> 19:40.119
it was an easy decision to make

19:40.130 --> 19:43.130
because I want the most symmetry

19:40.130 --> 19:43.130
that I can have.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.109
- How are you?

19:43.140 --> 19:45.109
- Good. How you doing?

19:45.119 --> 19:46.240
- Good to see you, my man.

19:45.119 --> 19:46.240
- Good to see you, too.

19:47.029 --> 19:48.230
But now that it's surgery day,

19:49.009 --> 19:51.029
I'm a little anxious

19:49.009 --> 19:51.029
and a little nervous

19:51.039 --> 19:53.190
and just really, really hoping

19:51.039 --> 19:53.190
that I made the right choice.

19:53.200 --> 19:57.049
So we have to take the skin off

19:53.200 --> 19:57.049
and we have to find something

19:57.059 --> 20:00.210
that will replace the muscle

19:57.059 --> 20:00.210
and the soft tissue.

20:00.220 --> 20:02.049
You know what

20:00.220 --> 20:02.049
you could do, too?

20:02.059 --> 20:03.069
- What?

20:02.059 --> 20:03.069
- Get a shark

20:03.079 --> 20:04.069
to come on the other side.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.180
DR. DUBROW: Today

20:10.240 --> 20:12.180
for Donnie's surgery,

20:12.190 --> 20:14.190
I will start

20:12.190 --> 20:14.190
by removing the skin graft

20:14.200 --> 20:16.099
from the lower left flank.

20:17.190 --> 20:18.230
Then I will elevate and

20:17.190 --> 20:18.230
inspect the surrounding tissue

20:19.250 --> 20:20.230
to see what I can use

20:19.250 --> 20:20.230
to fill in the defect.

20:22.109 --> 20:23.190
Next, I will bring

20:22.109 --> 20:23.190
the skin edges together

20:24.259 --> 20:25.289
and close the wound before

20:24.259 --> 20:25.289
turning him onto his back.

20:27.220 --> 20:29.230
Starting the tummy tuck,

20:27.220 --> 20:29.230
I'll make a horizontal incision

20:30.019 --> 20:32.230
across his lower abdomen,

20:30.019 --> 20:32.230
remove his excess skin

20:33.029 --> 20:35.200
and try to achieve symmetry

20:33.029 --> 20:35.200
with the right side.

20:35.210 --> 20:37.160
All right, so the first thing

20:35.210 --> 20:37.160
we're going to do

20:37.170 --> 20:39.079
is remove the skin graft.

20:39.089 --> 20:41.250
And the most difficult area

20:41.259 --> 20:43.269
is right on top of his bone.

20:43.279 --> 20:45.220
May be a little bit

20:43.279 --> 20:45.220
of a challenge

20:45.230 --> 20:48.089
to remove the skin graft

20:45.230 --> 20:48.089
without injuring

20:48.099 --> 20:51.180
the underlying tissue

20:48.099 --> 20:51.180
including the bone itself.

20:51.190 --> 20:55.109
The key is you got to make sure

20:51.190 --> 20:55.109
you get every cell of skin

20:55.119 --> 20:57.190
because if you leave

20:55.119 --> 20:57.190
any skin on the inside,

20:57.200 --> 21:01.220
the skin will make new skin

20:57.200 --> 21:01.220
and will form granulomas.

21:01.230 --> 21:04.079
So this is the entire

21:01.230 --> 21:04.079
skin graft, the whole thing.

21:04.089 --> 21:05.119
Here, would you take that?

21:05.130 --> 21:07.079
Okay, so here's the thing.

21:07.089 --> 21:08.269
Now we're gonna elevate up

21:08.279 --> 21:11.180
the surrounding tissue

21:08.279 --> 21:11.180
to see what we have.

21:11.190 --> 21:14.109
This is gonna be a difficult

21:11.190 --> 21:14.109
reconstructive problem

21:14.119 --> 21:17.109
because I don't have

21:14.119 --> 21:17.109
any muscle in the area.

21:17.119 --> 21:20.069
The muscle near the area

21:17.119 --> 21:20.069
that I have

21:20.079 --> 21:22.069
is not gonna move in very well.

21:22.079 --> 21:23.269
So the only thing I have left

21:22.079 --> 21:23.269
are the love handles.

21:24.059 --> 21:26.250
Hopefully, I could elevate

21:24.059 --> 21:26.250
the love handles

21:26.259 --> 21:29.230
in such a way that it'll

21:26.259 --> 21:29.230
fill out that defect

21:29.240 --> 21:31.160
and stay alive.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.230
Normally we tell them

21:31.170 --> 21:32.230
to lose weight

21:32.240 --> 21:34.079
before an operation like this,

21:34.089 --> 21:35.250
but it's good

21:34.089 --> 21:35.250
that he gained weight.

21:35.259 --> 21:38.180
Remember that expression

21:35.259 --> 21:38.180
more cushion for the pushin'?

21:38.190 --> 21:40.190
Well, in this case,

21:38.190 --> 21:40.190
it's more cushion

21:40.200 --> 21:42.079
for the concavity.

21:42.089 --> 21:44.250
The big question is:

21:42.089 --> 21:44.250
will this fat survive?

21:44.259 --> 21:46.200
Sometimes you have

21:44.259 --> 21:46.200
to make up procedures

21:46.210 --> 21:51.109
in plastic surgery based

21:46.210 --> 21:51.109
on well-founded principles.

21:51.119 --> 21:53.160
You can't just lift up the

21:51.119 --> 21:53.160
piece of fat and move it over.

21:53.170 --> 21:56.220
It has to have

21:53.170 --> 21:56.220
its own blood supply.

21:56.230 --> 21:58.259
This is the first time

21:56.230 --> 21:58.259
I've done what I would call

21:58.269 --> 22:02.069
a sliding fat flap advancement

22:02.079 --> 22:03.230
to the front part.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.140
I hope it works,

22:03.240 --> 22:06.140
and if it does,

22:06.150 --> 22:08.140
I'm a ----ing genius.

22:08.150 --> 22:10.200
We've got the defect

22:08.150 --> 22:10.200
and the hole filled in.

22:10.210 --> 22:15.180
We go and lay up the flap.

22:10.210 --> 22:15.180
We can now remove this tissue,

22:15.190 --> 22:19.099
go into the right flank

22:15.190 --> 22:19.099
and try to match the left flank.

22:19.109 --> 22:20.279
Now that the left side

22:19.109 --> 22:20.279
is completed,

22:20.289 --> 22:23.170
I still have

22:20.289 --> 22:23.170
to achieve symmetry,

22:23.180 --> 22:25.130
and that really depends

22:23.180 --> 22:25.130
upon my ability

22:25.140 --> 22:28.130
to manipulate the right side

22:28.140 --> 22:30.140
to make it look

22:28.140 --> 22:30.140
like the left side.

22:30.150 --> 22:31.279
All right, let's bring

22:30.150 --> 22:31.279
the belly button out.

22:32.069 --> 22:34.140
All right.

22:32.069 --> 22:34.140
So let's check this out.

22:34.150 --> 22:36.099
We have a nice flat abdomen.

22:36.109 --> 22:39.170
We have two small love handles

22:36.109 --> 22:39.170
that are symmetrical.

22:39.180 --> 22:41.170
We've got

22:39.180 --> 22:41.170
that entire skin graft

22:41.180 --> 22:44.140
and the concavity

22:41.180 --> 22:44.140
completely gone.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.250
And I would submit we have

22:45.160 --> 22:48.250
a normal-looking abdomen.

22:48.259 --> 22:50.099
- Huh?

22:48.259 --> 22:50.099
- Absolutely.

22:50.109 --> 22:51.269
Overall,

22:50.109 --> 22:51.269
I'm sort of cautiously

22:51.279 --> 22:55.269
optimistic/incredibly happy.

22:55.279 --> 22:59.170
And if it heals,

22:55.279 --> 22:59.170
it should be a massive home run

22:59.180 --> 23:02.000
and you can call me

22:59.180 --> 23:02.000
a shark hunter.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.230
All right.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.230
Let's close it.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.190
Paulina?

23:03.240 --> 23:05.190
It's one thing

23:05.200 --> 23:07.240
to name your son

23:05.200 --> 23:07.240
after you but your daughter?

23:07.250 --> 23:09.160
Why don't you wait

23:07.250 --> 23:09.160
until the baby comes out?

23:09.170 --> 23:11.069
If it has a hairy back, Paulina.

23:12.259 --> 23:14.240
My page got disabled.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.109

23:14.250 --> 23:16.109
- No.

- Don't lie, Chanel.

than most of our patients

of lupus.

Thank God she has been clear

23:50.160 --> 23:53.150
from lupus for over a year,

23:53.160 --> 23:55.269
so now is the right time

23:53.160 --> 23:55.269
to do the procedure.

24:06.289 --> 24:09.150
We'll use spreader grafts

24:06.289 --> 24:09.150
and alar batten grafts

24:09.160 --> 24:12.150
to open her airway and

24:09.160 --> 24:12.150
add structure to her nostrils.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.210
Next, we'll elevate

24:12.160 --> 24:14.210
her drooping columella.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.269
Lastly, we outfracture

24:14.220 --> 24:16.269
her turbinates

24:16.279 --> 24:18.019
to help her breathing.

24:18.029 --> 24:20.019
I'm starting my incision now.

24:20.029 --> 24:21.230
And we're starting

24:20.029 --> 24:21.230
the rib cartilage harvest

24:21.240 --> 24:24.000
at the same time.

24:24.009 --> 24:26.160
Let's see how thick

24:24.009 --> 24:26.160
we can keep this tip skin.

24:26.170 --> 24:28.029
The thicker we keep it,

24:28.039 --> 24:32.019
the better to the survival

24:28.039 --> 24:32.019
of the skin.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.250
All right. So that's good.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.250
That went pretty well.

24:35.259 --> 24:38.009
We got a nice

24:35.259 --> 24:38.009
big piece of rib.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.140
- That's huge.

24:39.150 --> 24:40.240
Build a whole new nose

24:39.150 --> 24:40.240
out of it.

24:40.250 --> 24:44.220
So the skin

24:40.250 --> 24:44.220
on the side of the nose

24:44.230 --> 24:48.200
is stuck to part

24:44.230 --> 24:48.200
of the cartilage here.

24:48.210 --> 24:52.009
Jesus.

24:48.210 --> 24:52.009
It looks like a gnarled mess

24:52.019 --> 24:53.180
of a bunch of cartilage.

24:52.019 --> 24:53.180
Look at that.

24:53.190 --> 24:55.009
Wow. Yeah, it really does.

24:55.019 --> 24:56.190
And then

24:55.019 --> 24:56.190
look at this right here.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.000
Getting into Lisa's nose

24:56.200 --> 24:59.000
is so difficult

24:59.009 --> 25:01.049
because I don't know

24:59.009 --> 25:01.049
what I'm looking at.

25:01.059 --> 25:03.200
Usually

25:01.059 --> 25:03.200
I can identify tip cartilage.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.039
In Lisa's case,

25:03.210 --> 25:06.039
her previous surgeries

25:06.049 --> 25:09.180
left her with gnarled, curled,

25:09.190 --> 25:12.220
narrow, overresected something.

25:12.230 --> 25:14.210
This is probably

25:12.230 --> 25:14.210
in the top three

25:14.220 --> 25:17.009
messed-up tip cartilages

25:14.220 --> 25:17.009
that I've seen.

25:17.019 --> 25:19.230
Look at that.

25:17.019 --> 25:19.230
That's all the cartilage.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.289
It's not usable.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.289
Ugh. Wow.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.019
This is all gonna have

25:23.000 --> 25:25.019
to be reconstructed.

25:25.029 --> 25:27.230
My hope for being able

25:25.029 --> 25:27.230
to salvage

25:27.240 --> 25:31.039
Lisa's natural cartilage

25:27.240 --> 25:31.039
is now gone.

25:31.049 --> 25:32.250
Here we go.

25:31.049 --> 25:32.250
Cutting off this whole

25:32.259 --> 25:34.220
beautiful piece of cartilage.

25:35.250 --> 25:37.180
Ugh. Oh, God.

25:37.190 --> 25:39.220
So what I'm gonna have to do,

25:39.230 --> 25:43.180
cut it out completely

25:39.230 --> 25:43.180
and take new rib cartilage

25:43.190 --> 25:45.170
and use that to reconstruct

25:43.190 --> 25:45.170
Lisa's tip.

25:45.180 --> 25:47.190
Spreader grafts are going in.

25:50.009 --> 25:52.269
I don't like that.

25:50.009 --> 25:52.269
I just don't like this.

25:52.279 --> 25:53.250
- This?

25:52.279 --> 25:53.250
- I just don't--yeah.

25:53.259 --> 25:55.029
This is what's--

25:55.039 --> 25:56.039
this is what's

25:55.039 --> 25:56.039
causing her problem.

25:56.049 --> 25:58.039
Yeah, this is a hard tip.

25:58.049 --> 26:02.160
When I see a patient

25:58.049 --> 26:02.160
that has extremely thin skin,

26:02.170 --> 26:04.029
if I put a piece of cartilage

26:02.170 --> 26:04.029
in there

26:04.039 --> 26:06.269
called an infratip graft,

26:04.039 --> 26:06.269
you're gonna see the edges.

26:06.279 --> 26:08.220
I'm gonna take a chance,

26:06.279 --> 26:08.220
then we'll put it

26:08.230 --> 26:10.269
in your diced cartilage

26:08.230 --> 26:10.269
glue graft.

26:10.279 --> 26:14.289
So this calls for what we call

26:10.279 --> 26:14.289
a diced cartilage glue graft.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.170
So I take the cartilage,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.170
dice it up,

26:16.180 --> 26:18.059
add something

26:16.180 --> 26:18.059
called fibrin glue

26:18.150 --> 26:20.039
and I can mold my own cartilage

26:20.049 --> 26:21.289
as it's chopped up

26:20.049 --> 26:21.289
into small pieces.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.069
That way, I can put it

26:22.000 --> 26:24.069
on the tip

26:24.160 --> 26:27.000
then close the skin

26:24.160 --> 26:27.000
and at least have the tip

26:27.009 --> 26:30.190
look more natural

26:27.009 --> 26:30.190
without any rough edges.

26:30.200 --> 26:33.039
- So much better.

26:30.200 --> 26:33.039
- I think it looks marvelous.

26:33.049 --> 26:35.190
Yeah, how does the airway

26:33.049 --> 26:35.190
look from below?

26:35.200 --> 26:36.269
- It's really good.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.269
- All right.

26:36.279 --> 26:38.210
Aggressive surgery,

26:38.220 --> 26:40.180
but we needed

26:38.220 --> 26:40.180
aggressive measures

26:40.190 --> 26:43.059
for aggressive findings

26:40.190 --> 26:43.059
like this, so...

26:43.069 --> 26:44.250
Thank you so much.

26:44.259 --> 26:48.160
[music]

26:50.000 --> 26:51.250
So, pregnant wife.

26:51.259 --> 26:54.000
Do we have a name

26:51.259 --> 26:54.000
or are we working on that?

26:54.009 --> 26:55.269
[sighs heavily]

26:55.279 --> 26:57.259
Paulina.

26:57.269 --> 26:58.250
Really?

26:58.259 --> 27:00.089
I have three boys, right?

27:00.099 --> 27:02.049
You know I've wanted

27:00.099 --> 27:02.049
to name one of them Paul.

27:02.059 --> 27:04.000
Paulina.

27:02.059 --> 27:04.000
It's one thing to name your son

27:04.009 --> 27:06.000
after you but your daughter?

27:06.009 --> 27:08.009
- Her family is saying no.

27:06.009 --> 27:08.009
- Not set in stone?

27:08.019 --> 27:08.279
You know, it's not set--

27:08.019 --> 27:08.279
you know, don't name her--

27:08.289 --> 27:10.180
What's second choice?

27:10.190 --> 27:11.289
- I don't know.

27:10.190 --> 27:11.289
- You must have two, three--

27:12.000 --> 27:13.230
Brittany's

27:12.000 --> 27:13.230
middle name is Nicole.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.049
Why do you have to name

27:13.240 --> 27:16.049
the child after yourselves?

27:16.059 --> 27:18.190
Why don't you wait

27:16.059 --> 27:18.190
until the baby comes out?

27:18.200 --> 27:20.009
And as you're pulling

27:18.200 --> 27:20.009
the baby out,

27:20.019 --> 27:22.099
if it has a hairy back,

27:20.019 --> 27:22.099
Paulina.

27:22.109 --> 27:24.289
[laughter]

27:25.000 --> 27:28.200
If I were Paul, I wouldn't

27:25.000 --> 27:28.200
name my daughter Paulina

27:28.210 --> 27:31.019
because it may increase

27:28.210 --> 27:31.019
the chances

27:31.029 --> 27:34.059
that she looks like him

27:31.029 --> 27:34.059
and not Brittany,

27:34.069 --> 27:35.259
and that's not good.

27:35.269 --> 27:39.220
You know people who have

27:35.269 --> 27:39.220
big social media followings?

27:39.230 --> 27:41.269
They're based on something,

27:39.230 --> 27:41.269
right?

27:41.279 --> 27:44.009
- Yes.

27:41.279 --> 27:44.009
- This person is named Chanel.

27:44.019 --> 27:46.289
Her entire social media presence

27:47.000 --> 27:49.089
is based on the plastic surgery

27:47.000 --> 27:49.089
that she's had.

27:49.190 --> 27:52.049
So here's her breasts.

27:52.059 --> 27:54.059
Irregular-shaped areolas.

27:54.069 --> 27:56.019
So she wants you

27:54.069 --> 27:56.019
to improve her breast area?

27:56.029 --> 27:57.220
I think

27:56.029 --> 27:57.220
it's mainly the breast.

27:57.230 --> 27:59.029
Can you please

27:57.230 --> 27:59.029
send in Chanel?

28:01.079 --> 28:03.079
- Chanel.

28:01.079 --> 28:03.079
- Oh my God.

28:03.089 --> 28:04.240
- How are you?

28:03.089 --> 28:04.240
- So excited.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.220
Nice to meet you.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.220
Dr. Nassif.

28:06.230 --> 28:09.220
I have so much faith

28:06.230 --> 28:09.220
in Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow.

28:09.230 --> 28:14.099
I need them to create these

28:09.230 --> 28:14.099
1,500cc silicone implants.

28:14.190 --> 28:16.279
All they need to do is,

28:14.190 --> 28:16.279
like, the research

28:16.289 --> 28:20.009
and a little study

28:16.289 --> 28:20.009
and it's done.

28:20.019 --> 28:21.089
Your main thing

28:20.019 --> 28:21.089
is Instagram, right?

28:21.099 --> 28:23.000
- Photos, right?

28:21.099 --> 28:23.000
- Yeah. Yes.

28:23.009 --> 28:24.019
I know it's engagement

28:23.009 --> 28:24.019
and followers.

28:24.029 --> 28:25.079
How many do you have?

28:25.089 --> 28:27.099
I had 1.2 million followers,

28:27.190 --> 28:29.210
- but my page got disabled.

28:27.190 --> 28:29.210
- Wow.

28:29.220 --> 28:32.220
- Uh-oh. Was there nudity?

28:29.220 --> 28:32.220
- No.

28:32.230 --> 28:34.210
Don't lie, Chanel.

28:32.230 --> 28:34.210
You're naughty.

28:34.220 --> 28:35.269
No, there's no nude.

28:34.220 --> 28:35.269
There's no nude.

28:35.279 --> 28:37.230
- There was some naughtiness?

28:35.279 --> 28:37.230
- Maybe--

28:37.240 --> 28:41.029
Just like a front view

28:37.240 --> 28:41.029
of her--kind of like her vaj.

28:41.039 --> 28:43.000
- That's--

28:41.039 --> 28:43.000
- Now we get it.

28:43.009 --> 28:45.000
It's a shame.

28:43.009 --> 28:45.000
A little bit of vaj

28:45.009 --> 28:50.029
can take you far

28:45.009 --> 28:50.029
or bring you back.

28:50.039 --> 28:52.059
So what is going on

28:50.039 --> 28:52.059
with your breasts?

28:52.069 --> 28:53.089
What's the first thing you have?

28:53.099 --> 28:54.049
Okay,

28:53.099 --> 28:54.049
from the very beginning

28:54.059 --> 28:55.210
was my first boob job

28:55.220 --> 28:57.130
when I was 19 in Beverly Hills.

28:57.220 --> 28:59.089
What size implants

28:57.220 --> 28:59.089
did you start with?

28:59.099 --> 29:01.089
- The 550.

28:59.099 --> 29:01.089
- Okay. Pretty big.

29:01.099 --> 29:03.119
- Pretty small.

29:01.099 --> 29:03.119
- Oh. Okay.

29:03.130 --> 29:05.289
Yeah. So then I got

29:03.130 --> 29:05.289
my second breast augmentation

29:06.000 --> 29:07.240
- in Bolivia.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.240
- Why?

29:07.250 --> 29:09.089
Why not? [laughs]

29:09.099 --> 29:11.240
No. Nothing wrong

29:09.099 --> 29:11.240
with Bolivia, but I mean, why--

29:11.250 --> 29:13.259
Because I just like

29:11.250 --> 29:13.259
to travel.

29:13.269 --> 29:17.019
- And what size did you put in?

29:13.269 --> 29:17.019
- I did 700.

29:17.029 --> 29:18.250
A hundred and fifty bigger?

29:18.259 --> 29:21.039
A hundred and fifty

29:18.259 --> 29:21.039
cc increase

29:21.049 --> 29:24.089
is like, you know,

29:21.049 --> 29:24.089
ten tablespoons.

29:24.099 --> 29:26.059
I know.

29:24.099 --> 29:26.059
I thought it would be major

29:26.069 --> 29:27.210
and it wasn't major.

29:27.220 --> 29:29.240
Who's flying to Bolivia

29:29.250 --> 29:32.289
for 10 tablespoons

29:29.250 --> 29:32.289
of silicone?

29:33.000 --> 29:37.039
It's like going from Los Angeles

29:33.000 --> 29:37.039
to New York for a cup of tea.

29:37.049 --> 29:41.240
After that, I did

29:37.049 --> 29:41.240
my breasts again and I did 800.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.220
- Where'd you do that?

29:41.250 --> 29:43.220
- In Columbia, so--

29:43.230 --> 29:45.049
So you went up

29:43.230 --> 29:45.049
a hundred ccs.

29:47.059 --> 29:50.250
I just had to see,

29:47.059 --> 29:50.250
like, maybe I'll be satisfied.

29:50.259 --> 29:52.069
- Were you?

29:50.259 --> 29:52.069
- No.

29:52.079 --> 29:53.230
- Okay.

29:52.079 --> 29:53.230
- [chuckles]

29:53.240 --> 29:56.019
And then just

29:53.240 --> 29:56.019
over the years,

29:56.029 --> 29:58.099
it just looks like my areolas

29:56.029 --> 29:58.099
are two different shapes,

29:58.109 --> 30:00.089
- which is so embarrassing.

29:58.109 --> 30:00.089
- Right.

30:00.099 --> 30:03.099
And I want them done again.

30:00.099 --> 30:03.099
I need hella more.

30:03.109 --> 30:05.279
Well, how can you

30:03.109 --> 30:05.279
get bigger than 800css?

30:05.289 --> 30:07.269
- You can make them.

30:05.289 --> 30:07.269
- Make big silicone implants?

30:07.279 --> 30:09.059
You guys do have connections.

30:09.069 --> 30:10.059
Yes. You guys have connections.

30:14.069 --> 30:17.109
So you can see,

30:14.069 --> 30:17.109
this is much smaller,

30:17.119 --> 30:19.059
the right side,

30:17.119 --> 30:19.059
but it's a little swollen.

30:19.069 --> 30:21.059
I'm nervous

30:19.069 --> 30:21.059
because I haven't seen

30:21.069 --> 30:23.130
my side yet

30:21.069 --> 30:23.130
and I'm most fearful

30:23.220 --> 30:25.269
that there's still gonna be

30:23.220 --> 30:25.269
an indention there.

30:27.230 --> 30:30.259
- How are you doing?

30:27.230 --> 30:30.259
- I'm hurting. Lupus.

30:30.269 --> 30:32.029
Oh, really?

30:37.109 --> 30:38.170
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

30:45.140 --> 30:46.089
Okay, so do me a favor.

30:45.140 --> 30:46.089
First thing I want you to do

30:47.049 --> 30:48.240
is put your hands

30:47.049 --> 30:48.240
on your hips and push.

30:48.250 --> 30:51.009
Okay.

30:48.250 --> 30:51.009
So you're under the muscle.

30:51.019 --> 30:52.150
Is that what you did

30:51.019 --> 30:52.150
on your Instagram post?

30:52.230 --> 30:54.140
Do you do--do you do that

30:52.230 --> 30:54.140
on your Instagram?

30:54.150 --> 30:56.109
No.

30:54.150 --> 30:56.109
I do it in the club though.

30:56.119 --> 30:58.059
All right.

30:56.119 --> 30:58.059
Well, the good news

30:58.069 --> 30:59.230
- is you're under the muscle.

30:58.069 --> 30:59.230
- Yeah.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.259
And that's where

30:59.240 --> 31:00.259
you wanna be

31:00.269 --> 31:02.109
to help

31:00.269 --> 31:02.109
to prevent hardening.

31:02.119 --> 31:03.279
- Mm-hmm.

31:02.119 --> 31:03.279
- And changes in the position,

31:03.289 --> 31:05.009
- so that's good.

31:03.289 --> 31:05.009
- Right.

31:05.019 --> 31:06.289
- But we do notice...

31:05.019 --> 31:06.289
- Mm-hmm.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.140
- ...a little dent in here.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.140
- It's like a little bubble.

31:08.230 --> 31:09.240
- Yeah.

31:08.230 --> 31:09.240
- It's weird.

31:09.250 --> 31:10.140
- You know what it is?

31:09.250 --> 31:10.140
- No.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.250
It's the implant.

31:11.259 --> 31:13.029
Can you hand me that implant?

31:13.039 --> 31:14.059
- Feel that.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.059
- Yes.

31:14.069 --> 31:15.039
It feels like--just like that.

31:15.049 --> 31:16.059
That's exactly what it is.

31:16.069 --> 31:17.160
It's a little bit

31:16.069 --> 31:17.160
thin there,

31:17.170 --> 31:19.160
so you can feel the implant

31:17.170 --> 31:19.160
through the skin.

31:19.250 --> 31:22.009
That's a pressure phenomenon.

31:22.019 --> 31:24.000
That's actually called

31:22.019 --> 31:24.000
pressure atrophy.

31:24.009 --> 31:27.069
The more it pushes,

31:24.009 --> 31:27.069
the thinner the tissue gets

31:27.079 --> 31:29.049
and at some point,

31:27.079 --> 31:29.049
if it's too big,

31:29.059 --> 31:32.130
it gets so thin that

31:29.059 --> 31:32.130
the implant can show through.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.289
- Yeah.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.289
- Can expose.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.109
The best thing is

31:34.000 --> 31:35.109
to take them out for a while,

31:35.119 --> 31:37.069
let them breathe

31:35.119 --> 31:37.069
and give it a rest.

31:37.079 --> 31:40.150
If you do that--

31:37.079 --> 31:40.150
wait, wait, wait. [laughs]

31:40.160 --> 31:42.000
You want me

31:40.160 --> 31:42.000
to be homeless?

31:42.009 --> 31:43.130
[laughter]

31:43.140 --> 31:45.089
No chance, right?

31:43.140 --> 31:45.089
Okay.

31:45.099 --> 31:47.019
I didn't expect that reaction

31:45.099 --> 31:47.019
by the way.

31:47.029 --> 31:49.130
Now, you're opposed to saline

31:47.029 --> 31:49.130
and you can't get--

31:49.140 --> 31:51.059
and forget about it,

31:51.069 --> 31:53.269
getting larger

31:51.069 --> 31:53.269
silicone implants.

31:53.279 --> 31:56.059
- You can't make them?

31:53.279 --> 31:56.059
- I don't make implants.

31:56.069 --> 31:57.119
I'm a plastic surgeon.

31:57.130 --> 31:58.079
I'm not the implant

31:57.130 --> 31:58.079
manufacturer.

31:59.029 --> 31:59.190
- You can't call.

31:59.029 --> 31:59.190
- They--they would--

31:59.200 --> 32:01.269
they would say yeah, no.

32:01.279 --> 32:04.059
Literally, there'd be

32:01.279 --> 32:04.059
two words: yeah, no.

32:04.069 --> 32:07.099
No implant manufacturers

32:04.069 --> 32:07.099
make implants

32:07.109 --> 32:09.079
greater than 800ccs.

32:09.089 --> 32:12.069
Although you can overfill

32:09.089 --> 32:12.069
a saline implant,

32:12.079 --> 32:14.150
if you go

32:12.079 --> 32:14.150
more than 10% over that,

32:14.240 --> 32:17.109
you lose the warranty

32:14.240 --> 32:17.109
and it's actually dangerous.

32:17.119 --> 32:21.140
Thankfully there's no

32:17.119 --> 32:21.140
black market silicone implants

32:21.150 --> 32:24.089
made over 800ccs,

32:21.150 --> 32:24.089
so we don't have to worry

32:24.099 --> 32:28.069
about that disaster

32:24.099 --> 32:28.069
happening any time soon.

32:28.079 --> 32:30.069
Okay.

32:28.079 --> 32:30.069
So when are they gonna make it?

32:30.079 --> 32:34.150
Never, because the FDA

32:30.079 --> 32:34.150
approves implants

32:34.160 --> 32:36.049
based on their safety profile.

32:36.059 --> 32:40.109
The other thing is

32:36.059 --> 32:40.109
your areolas are uneven.

32:40.119 --> 32:43.130
You can make them both smaller

32:40.119 --> 32:43.130
and more symmetrical.

32:43.140 --> 32:45.059
- Mm-hmm.

32:43.140 --> 32:45.059
- The problem with doing that

32:45.069 --> 32:48.119
is your breast

32:45.069 --> 32:48.119
implants are big.

32:48.130 --> 32:51.019
And if you shrink down

32:48.130 --> 32:51.019
the areola

32:51.029 --> 32:53.059
by cutting

32:51.029 --> 32:53.059
some areolar tissue out,

32:53.069 --> 32:54.289
it's gonna make everything

32:53.069 --> 32:54.289
tighter.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.019
- Mm-hmm.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.019
- And then you have

32:56.029 --> 32:58.000
such invisible incisions now

32:58.009 --> 33:00.049
that I couldn't even

32:58.009 --> 33:00.049
see them in the picture,

33:00.059 --> 33:04.190
what if they turn really

33:00.059 --> 33:04.190
visible, dark, ropey scars?

33:04.269 --> 33:06.170
What do you think?

33:06.259 --> 33:08.289
Since you already have

33:06.259 --> 33:08.289
some potential complication,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.049
- especially with that thinning.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.049
- Mm-hmm.

33:11.059 --> 33:13.019
You're gonna make

33:11.059 --> 33:13.019
that worse.

33:13.029 --> 33:14.269
- The risk is so much greater...

33:13.029 --> 33:14.269
- Mm-hmm.

33:14.279 --> 33:16.150
than the benefit from this.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.049
- So it's pretty risky.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.049
- Yeah.

33:19.059 --> 33:20.150
I kind of have

33:19.059 --> 33:20.150
to just accept it

33:20.160 --> 33:23.049
for what it is

33:20.160 --> 33:23.049
because at the end of the day,

33:23.059 --> 33:26.069
I have to be safe and I don't

33:23.059 --> 33:26.069
want anything to happen.

33:26.079 --> 33:29.059
So I'm gonna just deal with it.

33:29.069 --> 33:31.049
- I feel our job is done here.

33:29.069 --> 33:31.049
- Mm-hmm.

33:31.059 --> 33:32.089
- Yeah.

33:31.059 --> 33:32.089
- I think we've done a good job.

33:33.140 --> 33:35.109
Now, we can teach you guys

33:33.140 --> 33:35.109
how to do a proper selfie.

33:35.119 --> 33:37.000
- Oh.

33:35.119 --> 33:37.000
- Oh. Yeah.

33:37.009 --> 33:38.289
- Butt selfie.

33:37.009 --> 33:38.289
- A butt selfie?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.089
I--I gotta see his butt

33:39.000 --> 33:41.089
on Instagram?

33:41.099 --> 33:42.190
Ugh.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.180
- Ready?

33:42.200 --> 33:43.180
- Okay. Ready.

33:43.269 --> 33:46.119
Yeah. Yeah.

33:46.130 --> 33:49.099
You look like you're

33:46.130 --> 33:49.099
gonna take a poop. [laughs]

33:49.109 --> 33:51.009
Great, here.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.180
You know, what can I say?

33:54.269 --> 33:58.180
Every selfie that Terry takes

33:54.269 --> 33:58.180
is an ass selfie.

33:58.190 --> 34:00.200
Look at him.

33:58.190 --> 34:00.200
He looks like an ass.

34:09.170 --> 34:11.030
- Lisa.

34:09.170 --> 34:11.030
- How's it going?

34:11.039 --> 34:12.050
- Hello.

34:11.039 --> 34:12.050
- Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.

34:12.059 --> 34:14.010
- How are you?

34:12.059 --> 34:14.010
- How you doing?

34:14.019 --> 34:16.070
I'm hurting.

34:16.079 --> 34:17.119
What do you mean by that?

34:17.130 --> 34:19.190
Your whole body

34:17.130 --> 34:19.190
or just your rib?

34:19.280 --> 34:21.179
My whole body. Lupus.

34:21.190 --> 34:23.039
Oh, really?

34:23.050 --> 34:24.199
My cheeks

34:23.050 --> 34:24.199
were really bad last night.

34:24.289 --> 34:26.119
The lupus,

34:24.289 --> 34:26.119
what do you--what do you mean?

34:26.130 --> 34:27.170
Just a flare.

34:27.179 --> 34:29.139
I am a little concerned

34:29.150 --> 34:32.199
because Lisa

34:29.150 --> 34:32.199
is having a lupus flare-up.

34:32.210 --> 34:35.010
When that happens,

34:32.210 --> 34:35.010
it could actually knock down

34:35.019 --> 34:38.070
your immune system

34:35.019 --> 34:38.070
and make you not heal as well.

34:38.079 --> 34:40.059
So we have to keep

34:38.079 --> 34:40.059
a close eye on her.

34:40.070 --> 34:42.130
I know my body

34:40.070 --> 34:42.130
and what it will do is

34:42.139 --> 34:45.010
for a week or two,

34:42.139 --> 34:45.010
I might feel like crap

34:45.019 --> 34:47.179
but I'll start to get better.

34:45.019 --> 34:47.179
It's not a bad flare.

34:47.190 --> 34:48.219
- Okay.

34:47.190 --> 34:48.219
- If that makes sense.

34:48.230 --> 34:49.190
- It does.

34:48.230 --> 34:49.190
- Yeah.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.019
What I wanna do first

34:51.030 --> 34:52.030
is I'm gonna look

34:51.030 --> 34:52.030
at your nose.

34:52.039 --> 34:54.099
Uh-huh.

34:54.110 --> 34:55.179
- Ah.

34:55.190 --> 34:56.210
Ah. Ah.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.019
That's nice and pink, huh?

34:59.030 --> 35:00.210
It's very reassuring

34:59.030 --> 35:00.210
to see the reaction

35:01.000 --> 35:02.199
that Dr. Nassif gave.

35:02.210 --> 35:05.150
It makes me feel excited

35:02.210 --> 35:05.150
for Lisa.

35:05.159 --> 35:08.019
I think she's just

35:05.159 --> 35:08.019
gonna be a happier person.

35:08.030 --> 35:09.210
First of all,

35:08.030 --> 35:09.210
with your rib harvest,

35:09.219 --> 35:11.219
I think we set a world record.

35:11.230 --> 35:15.070
Dr. Peng got out

35:11.230 --> 35:15.070
a piece of rib this big.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.119
I needed a lot by the way.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.119
Going in,

35:17.130 --> 35:19.090
everything was scarred down.

35:17.130 --> 35:19.090
Your cartilage,

35:19.099 --> 35:21.190
whatever it was,

35:19.099 --> 35:21.190
was stuck to your skin.

35:21.199 --> 35:25.039
And this is not

35:21.199 --> 35:25.039
a common procedure,

35:25.050 --> 35:28.090
but I had to remove

35:25.050 --> 35:28.090
about three-quarters

35:28.099 --> 35:30.139
of your natural cartilage

35:28.099 --> 35:30.139
in your nose

35:30.150 --> 35:32.210
- because it just was no good.

35:30.150 --> 35:32.210
- Okay.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.019
So--so on a scale

35:33.000 --> 35:35.019
of one to ten,

35:35.030 --> 35:36.219
how bad was this--the surgery?

35:36.230 --> 35:38.030
Yours was about an eight for me.

35:38.039 --> 35:39.070
- Okay.

35:38.039 --> 35:39.070
- For him.

35:39.079 --> 35:40.239
It would be an 11

35:39.079 --> 35:40.239
for anyone else.

35:40.250 --> 35:41.230
Wow.

35:42.010 --> 35:43.119
I'm so grateful

35:43.130 --> 35:45.199
that I got Dr. Nassif

35:43.130 --> 35:45.199
to fix my nose.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.050
This is gonna be worth the pain

35:47.059 --> 35:48.099
and I'm just gonna

35:47.059 --> 35:48.099
keep the faith

35:48.110 --> 35:51.150
that it's gonna heal the way

35:48.110 --> 35:51.150
we all want it to heal.

35:51.159 --> 35:54.050
- Used a lot of rib.

35:51.159 --> 35:54.050
- That's a lot of rib, yeah.

35:54.059 --> 35:55.230
I mean, you had

35:54.059 --> 35:55.230
a lot of rib to spare.

35:55.239 --> 35:59.219
In fact,

35:55.239 --> 35:59.219
in your nose is a spare rib.

35:59.230 --> 36:01.090
- We had--we had to do it.

35:59.230 --> 36:01.090
- Oh. [laughs]

36:01.099 --> 36:04.039
You know,

36:01.099 --> 36:04.039
because this was very serious,

36:04.050 --> 36:04.260
so we had--we had to get

36:04.050 --> 36:04.260
a little something--

36:05.250 --> 36:06.150
Can I enjoy this?

36:05.250 --> 36:06.150
He's laughing.

36:06.159 --> 36:07.010
Can I enjoy this for a minute?

36:07.019 --> 36:09.030
- Yes.

36:07.019 --> 36:09.030
- [laughs]

36:14.079 --> 36:16.090
- Hi.

36:14.079 --> 36:16.090
- Hello.

36:16.099 --> 36:17.230
- Hi.

36:16.099 --> 36:17.230
- How's it going?

36:17.239 --> 36:19.230
Who cares how we're doing?

36:17.239 --> 36:19.230
How are you doing?

36:19.239 --> 36:21.210
Which by the way,

36:19.239 --> 36:21.210
his face looks pretty good.

36:21.219 --> 36:23.190
He doesn't have

36:21.219 --> 36:23.190
that [grunts] look.

36:23.199 --> 36:25.039
Yeah.

36:23.199 --> 36:25.039
Are you in much pain?

36:25.050 --> 36:27.050
Yeah, just on

36:25.050 --> 36:27.050
the right side, it's--

36:27.059 --> 36:28.210
The right side?

36:27.059 --> 36:28.210
Not the left side.

36:28.219 --> 36:29.250
- Not the left side.

36:28.219 --> 36:29.250
- Okay.

36:29.260 --> 36:31.190
I'm not at all surprised

36:29.260 --> 36:31.190
Donnie

36:31.199 --> 36:33.230
doesn't have

36:31.199 --> 36:33.230
very much pain

36:33.239 --> 36:36.150
in the more operated side

36:33.239 --> 36:36.150
because

36:36.159 --> 36:39.170
most of the sensory nerves

36:36.159 --> 36:39.170
have already been disrupted,

36:39.179 --> 36:44.079
it's numb,

36:39.179 --> 36:44.079
and it's the non-injured side

36:44.090 --> 36:46.230
with all those nerves intact

36:44.090 --> 36:46.230
that are predictably gonna have

36:46.239 --> 36:49.070
more post-operative

36:46.239 --> 36:49.070
discomfort and pain.

36:49.079 --> 36:51.260
So you can see

36:49.079 --> 36:51.260
this is much smaller,

36:52.050 --> 36:54.170
the right side,

36:52.050 --> 36:54.170
but it's a little swollen, okay?

36:54.179 --> 36:56.260
- But it looks good, right?

36:54.179 --> 36:56.260
- Right. Yeah.

36:56.269 --> 36:59.130
I'm nervous because

36:56.269 --> 36:59.130
I haven't seen my side yet

36:59.139 --> 37:01.199
and I don't

36:59.139 --> 37:01.199
anticipate perfection,

37:01.210 --> 37:03.219
but I'm most fearful that

37:03.230 --> 37:05.139
there's still gonna be

37:03.230 --> 37:05.139
an indention there,

37:05.150 --> 37:07.130
I'm still

37:05.150 --> 37:07.130
just gonna look different.

37:07.139 --> 37:09.250
- Check this out.

37:07.139 --> 37:09.250
- Oh, my gosh.

37:10.039 --> 37:12.070
Look at that.

37:12.079 --> 37:13.190
Oh my gosh, Dr. Dubrow.

37:15.260 --> 37:18.130
I have been waiting

37:18.139 --> 37:21.150

37:21.159 --> 37:24.130
I love my nose.

37:24.139 --> 37:26.079
I have a Dr. Nassif nose.

37:26.090 --> 37:28.130
With the hole in my side,

37:26.090 --> 37:28.130
it took away my confidence.

37:28.139 --> 37:29.269
It affected me at work.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.130
It took away my social aspect

37:29.280 --> 37:32.130
of life.

I'm speechless, really.

37:50.079 --> 37:54.170
Dr. Dubrow did amazing.

The instant smile

37:54.179 --> 37:57.230
on Donnie's face.

37:57.239 --> 38:01.159
Like, I have not seen

37:57.239 --> 38:01.159
that smile in so long.

38:01.170 --> 38:04.139
It's okay. Remember

38:01.170 --> 38:04.139
the shark bite, remember that?

38:04.150 --> 38:08.090
Oh my gosh.

38:04.150 --> 38:08.090
You are amazing.

38:08.099 --> 38:09.090
I'm sorry, what?

38:08.099 --> 38:09.090
What did you say?

38:09.099 --> 38:10.099
You're--

38:09.099 --> 38:10.099
you're amazing, man.

38:10.110 --> 38:12.250
- What?

- I--I cannot--

I cannot even

38:13.030 --> 38:14.260

38:15.039 --> 38:17.159
You really can't even tell

38:15.039 --> 38:17.159
that something was there before.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.059
Like, it's gone.

38:19.070 --> 38:21.119
I'm--I'm just shocked

38:19.070 --> 38:21.119
and at a loss of words.

38:21.130 --> 38:24.099
This is in

38:21.130 --> 38:24.099
the top two results so far.

38:24.110 --> 38:26.260
- It's good, right?

38:24.110 --> 38:26.260
- Of all the years, top two.

38:26.269 --> 38:28.199
I must say

38:26.269 --> 38:28.199
Terry really did knock it out

38:28.210 --> 38:30.059
of the park with Donnie.

38:30.070 --> 38:31.199
I mean,

38:30.070 --> 38:31.199
this is a new technique.

38:31.210 --> 38:34.090
I've never seen it before,

38:31.210 --> 38:34.090
very innovative.

38:34.099 --> 38:35.159
Well done, Terry.

38:35.170 --> 38:37.190
- I'm ecstatic right now.

38:35.170 --> 38:37.190
- Cool, right?

38:37.199 --> 38:39.130
I can't even--

38:37.199 --> 38:39.130

it's, like--it's amazing.

38:42.079 --> 38:44.079
This is--

38:42.079 --> 38:44.079
this is unbelievable to me.

38:44.090 --> 38:45.210
- Huh?

38:44.090 --> 38:45.210
- Thank you so much.

38:45.219 --> 38:46.260
- Pleasure seeing you guys.

38:45.219 --> 38:46.260
- You're so welcome.

38:46.269 --> 38:48.090
- We'll see you very soon, okay?

38:46.269 --> 38:48.090
- Yes.

38:48.099 --> 38:49.230
Appreciate both of you guys.

38:49.239 --> 38:52.179
A big piece of my life

38:49.239 --> 38:52.179
left with me eight years ago

38:52.190 --> 38:54.179
in that hospital room

38:52.190 --> 38:54.179
when they took my skin out.

38:54.190 --> 38:56.230
And now,

38:54.190 --> 38:56.230
I think it's gonna be back

38:56.239 --> 39:00.119
and I think I can get back

38:56.239 --> 39:00.119
to doing the outdoor activities

39:00.130 --> 39:02.239
that I love to do,

39:00.130 --> 39:02.239
and just really getting back

39:02.250 --> 39:04.280
to being the old me again.

39:05.070 --> 39:07.110
Oh my gosh.

39:05.070 --> 39:07.110
I just really can't take it.

39:07.119 --> 39:08.179
It's just too much.

39:12.239 --> 39:15.260
Right after my surgery,

39:12.239 --> 39:15.260
I had a really bad lupus flare.

39:15.269 --> 39:18.239
It was like every little nerve

39:15.269 --> 39:18.239
in my body was on fire,

39:18.250 --> 39:20.130
but I'm doing much better.

39:20.139 --> 39:22.090
Dr. Nassif was amazing

39:20.139 --> 39:22.090
through all of this,

39:22.099 --> 39:24.260
and for the first time,

39:22.099 --> 39:24.260
I love my nose.

39:25.050 --> 39:27.150
This really has been a journey

39:25.050 --> 39:27.150
of a lifetime.

39:27.159 --> 39:29.269
It started as a little kid

39:27.159 --> 39:29.269
being made fun of

39:30.059 --> 39:32.280
to having two horrible surgeries

39:33.070 --> 39:35.280
that over the years

39:33.070 --> 39:35.280
completely messed up my nose.

39:36.079 --> 39:38.139
I have been waiting

39:47.099 --> 39:49.150
Honestly,

39:47.099 --> 39:49.150

39:49.159 --> 39:53.130
could fix what I had

39:49.159 --> 39:53.130
and here we are.

39:53.139 --> 39:54.199
He fixed it.

39:54.210 --> 39:55.280
I mean,

39:54.210 --> 39:55.280
I have a perfect nose now.

39:55.289 --> 39:58.210
[laughs] I have

39:55.289 --> 39:58.210
a Dr. Nassif nose.

39:58.219 --> 40:00.090
That's right.

40:00.099 --> 40:01.269
That's pretty awesome.

40:00.099 --> 40:01.269
And I can breathe.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.190
Before my surgery

40:01.280 --> 40:03.190
with Dr. Nassif,

40:03.199 --> 40:05.210
my nose was lumpy, and bumpy,

40:05.219 --> 40:07.269
and it was collapsing

40:05.219 --> 40:07.269
and I could barely breathe.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.199
And now, my nose is smooth,

40:07.280 --> 40:10.199
and beautiful,

40:10.210 --> 40:12.239
and I've been able to trash

40:10.210 --> 40:12.239
everything I used to use

40:12.250 --> 40:16.179
to breathe

40:12.250 --> 40:16.179
because my airway is wide open.

40:16.190 --> 40:18.289
- No more nose strips.

40:16.190 --> 40:18.289
- Yeah.

40:19.070 --> 40:21.179
That's probably

40:19.070 --> 40:21.179
been one of the best parts.

40:21.190 --> 40:22.289
It's just time

40:21.190 --> 40:22.289
to move forward now.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.130

40:38.000 --> 40:39.260
I just remember

40:38.000 --> 40:39.260
all the times and trips

40:39.269 --> 40:42.280
and things we couldn't go do

40:39.269 --> 40:42.280
because I couldn't breathe,

40:42.289 --> 40:44.190
or I didn't feel good,

40:42.289 --> 40:44.190
or we couldn't come

40:44.199 --> 40:46.139
to the mountains

40:44.199 --> 40:46.139
because it would aggravate

40:46.150 --> 40:48.000
my nose even more.

spare ribs in my nose.

And then after the accident

41:26.130 --> 41:29.130
with the hole in my side,

41:29.139 --> 41:31.280
it took away my confidence.

41:51.219 --> 41:52.280
or just kind of thinking

41:52.289 --> 41:54.269
that I wasn't

41:52.289 --> 41:54.269
gonna do this anymore.

41:54.280 --> 41:57.250
Before my surgery, there was

41:54.280 --> 41:57.250
a big gaping hole in my side.

41:57.260 --> 42:00.210
But now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

41:57.260 --> 42:00.210
the hole is gone,

42:00.219 --> 42:02.289
I have symmetry,

42:00.219 --> 42:02.289
and I'm no longer in pain

42:03.000 --> 42:05.179
when my work belt rubs

42:03.000 --> 42:05.179
against my side or anything.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.019
There's no way

42:05.190 --> 42:07.019
you could possibly tell

42:07.030 --> 42:09.030
what my side looked like before.

42:09.110 --> 42:12.139
I'm back to dating again

42:09.110 --> 42:12.139
and it just feels amazing.

42:12.150 --> 42:14.280
Man, you guys have no idea,

42:12.150 --> 42:14.280
like, how good this feels.

42:14.289 --> 42:16.239
If we would've

42:14.289 --> 42:16.239
told you before

42:16.250 --> 42:17.199
that we were going

42:16.250 --> 42:17.199
to the beach,

42:18.110 --> 42:18.210
you probably wouldn't have come.

42:19.050 --> 42:20.010
There's no way.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.159
It's honestly, like,

42:21.000 --> 42:22.159
hard for me to believe

42:23.170 --> 42:24.260
where I was at before this

42:23.170 --> 42:24.260
and where I'm at now.

42:24.269 --> 42:26.130
I'm still taking it all in,

42:24.269 --> 42:26.130
I guess.

42:26.139 --> 42:27.190
- Yeah.

42:26.139 --> 42:27.190
- I think we're

42:27.199 --> 42:29.019
- taking it all in too.

42:27.199 --> 42:29.019
- Yeah.

42:29.030 --> 42:32.030
We actually have our son back.

42:32.110 --> 42:33.190
Yeah.

42:33.199 --> 42:34.250
It's amazing.

42:33.199 --> 42:34.250
I'm still in shock.

42:34.260 --> 42:37.179
Like, I'm not gonna lie,

42:34.260 --> 42:37.179
I did not think

42:37.190 --> 42:40.000
it was gonna look as good

42:37.190 --> 42:40.000
as it does.

42:40.010 --> 42:42.139
I never thought

42:40.010 --> 42:42.139
I was gonna get my brother back,

42:42.150 --> 42:47.230
and he's back

42:42.150 --> 42:47.230
and it's--it's genuinely

42:47.239 --> 42:51.000
so--so amazing to see.

42:51.010 --> 42:54.019
- Donnie!

42:51.010 --> 42:54.019
- Oh, my God!

42:54.030 --> 42:56.280
Go out there

42:54.030 --> 42:56.280
and show those sharks what's up.

42:56.289 --> 42:59.139
I can go fight one off

42:56.289 --> 42:59.139
real quick. Thanks, Gary.

42:59.150 --> 43:01.150
The shark bite story

42:59.150 --> 43:01.150
is long gone now.

43:03.179 --> 43:05.250
- Look at that thing.

43:03.179 --> 43:05.250
- [laughter]

43:08.039 --> 43:09.030
[squeals, laughs]

43:09.039 --> 43:11.159
He did it. He did it.

43:11.170 --> 43:12.159
Whoo!

43:12.170 --> 43:14.050
Yeah!

43:17.210 --> 43:21.139
I got six rounds of

43:17.210 --> 43:21.139
silicone injections in my arms

43:21.150 --> 43:24.210
and my ex actually broke up

43:21.150 --> 43:24.210
with me.

43:24.219 --> 43:26.280
He left me

43:24.219 --> 43:26.280
for getting plastic surgery.

43:26.289 --> 43:29.039
My tummy tuck

43:26.289 --> 43:29.039
didn't just destroy my stomach,

43:29.050 --> 43:30.210
it destroyed my marriage.

43:30.219 --> 43:32.199
You could put a fist

43:30.219 --> 43:32.199
in my stomach.

43:32.210 --> 43:34.230
I'm hoping there's

43:32.210 --> 43:34.230
a belly button sitting in there.

43:34.239 --> 43:36.059
Is there a belly button

43:34.239 --> 43:36.059
beneath this?

43:36.150 --> 43:37.159
Possibly.

43:37.170 --> 43:39.239
I can completely

43:37.170 --> 43:39.239
push my nose in.

43:39.250 --> 43:41.050
- [alarm chirping]

43:39.250 --> 43:41.050
- Fire alarm,

43:41.130 --> 43:43.039
we're going to have to extubate

43:41.130 --> 43:43.039
the patient.

43:43.050 --> 43:45.000
I'll leave them in.
