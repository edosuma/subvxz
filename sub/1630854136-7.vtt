WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:07.181
<i>In the nation's
largest city,</i>

00:07.181 --> 00:09.879
<i>the vicious and violent
members of the underworld</i>

00:09.879 --> 00:11.489
<i>are hunted by the detectives</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:14.710
<i>of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.</i>

00:14.710 --> 00:17.234
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:18.279 --> 00:19.976
We all know that
Henry's death...

00:21.456 --> 00:24.459
Paved the way for your
casino to move forward.

00:24.459 --> 00:25.938
Did you have anything
to do with this?

00:25.938 --> 00:27.244
I would never do anything

00:27.244 --> 00:28.985
that would jeopardize
your trust in me.

00:28.985 --> 00:31.944
You know how your husband and
his family run their business.

00:31.944 --> 00:35.209
Are you asking me to spy
on my family, take me down?

00:35.209 --> 00:36.949
To help you see things.

00:36.949 --> 00:40.605
I have some very important
information to share.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.309
Nervous?

00:48.309 --> 00:50.702
You kidding? I'm excited.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.227
Good. Me too.

00:56.665 --> 00:59.276
Oh, look, how beautiful.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.713
Not as beautiful as you.

01:01.713 --> 01:02.932
You know,
it just warms my heart

01:02.932 --> 01:04.107
to see two people in love.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.807
Looking for a special occasion?

01:08.807 --> 01:11.201
Uh, we're--
we're getting married.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.508
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.466
I'm Kevin, this is Amy.
What's your name?

01:15.466 --> 01:16.859
- I'm Jay.
- Jay.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.687
<i>Jay will be our
first point of contact.</i>

01:18.687 --> 01:22.256
Solid tip from a CI
puts Jay's store

01:22.256 --> 01:25.215
at ground zero of our operation
this afternoon.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.738
Means we need eyes
on the inside,

01:26.738 --> 01:29.219
and that'll come
from a young couple.

01:29.219 --> 01:30.568
<i>How'd you two meet?</i>

01:30.568 --> 01:33.354
Uh, I have this pug, Louie,
and I take him

01:33.354 --> 01:35.399
to the dog park every day.

01:35.399 --> 01:38.098
And Kevin was kind of
just always there.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.665
Only, um, he didn't have a dog.

01:40.665 --> 01:43.538
It actually took him a while

01:43.538 --> 01:46.889
to work up the courage
to ask me out.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.717
I guess I took pity on him.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.588
That's adorable.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.590
So is there anything in
particular you're looking for?

01:52.590 --> 01:54.375
<i>Person we're
really looking for</i>

01:54.375 --> 01:58.248
is Mikeal Abramov, Israeli
national, based in Europe.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.902
His international
crime syndicate

01:59.902 --> 02:02.731
has been on the NYPD's radar
for months.

02:02.731 --> 02:05.429
I'm talking drugs, guns,
human trafficking,

02:05.429 --> 02:08.824
all bankrolled by gold
he smuggles in from Sudan.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.435
Once he gets the gold to
the States, he melts it down,

02:11.435 --> 02:13.133
he makes jewelry out of it,

02:13.133 --> 02:14.743
and he sells it
to local businesses

02:14.743 --> 02:16.571
like Jay's
at 80¢ on the dollar.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.486
- So he's laundering the gold?
- Yeah.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.444
And then he takes that money
and he launders it

02:20.444 --> 02:21.619
through his other businesses.

02:21.619 --> 02:24.448
We shut off the
gold valve, the guns,

02:24.448 --> 02:26.972
drugs, human trafficking,
all dries up.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.148
When's the wedding?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.801
Oh, we're still deciding.

02:29.801 --> 02:33.283
Yeah, her, uh, her parents
don't want to contribute, so.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.200
Maybe if you would
ask for that raise,

02:37.200 --> 02:39.159
they wouldn't have
to contribute.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.336
You're really gonna
bring that up again, are you?

02:42.336 --> 02:43.511
That's really cute.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.599
They're having
their first fight.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.166
Wait till they have kids.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.255
<i>Leader, I got a subject
fitting the description</i>

02:48.255 --> 02:50.344
of a courier carrying a duffel.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.217
Yep, that's definitely her.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.045
I'm alerting
the happy couple.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.101
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

03:09.101 --> 03:10.277
Yeah.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.466
Jamie!

04:33.360 --> 04:34.448
Oh!

04:35.753 --> 04:37.799
Elliot?

04:37.799 --> 04:38.843
Tia.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.862
She called him Elliot, bro.

05:40.862 --> 05:43.473
- So maybe she's Vice.
- Nah.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.170
She reeks federal.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.347
Possibly a foreign agency.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.783
You're both wrong.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.220
Tia is actually Alice George,

05:51.220 --> 05:55.180
a CPA from Long Island,
unmarried and looking

05:55.180 --> 05:58.096
for her next adventure.

05:58.096 --> 06:00.838
So mystery solved.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.493
So she didn't tell you
she was coming to town?

06:03.493 --> 06:04.755
What, working the same case?

06:04.755 --> 06:06.453
I would have told you that,
but, you know.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.977
Undercover work,
that's her specialty, so.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.719
What was your relationship
like with her in Italy?

06:14.069 --> 06:16.680
Oh, I've never seen
that face before.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.857
Sorry about that.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.250
What did I miss?

06:21.250 --> 06:22.686
Detective Stabler was
telling me about the work

06:22.686 --> 06:24.514
you guys did together overseas.

06:24.514 --> 06:25.994
Oh, boy.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.083
I hope you didn't
tell her the truth.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.390
Agent Leonetti and I
worked a number

06:30.390 --> 06:32.522
of high profile
racketeering cases

06:32.522 --> 06:34.263
and we had some big busts.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.047
When I let him tag along.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.269
It's good
to see you again.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.227
It's nice to see you, Tia.

06:42.227 --> 06:45.796
Agent Leonetti, it's usual
courtesy for an outside agency

06:45.796 --> 06:48.538
to check in locally so that we
don't have confusion

06:48.538 --> 06:49.539
like we had earlier.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.149
I know, and I'm sorry.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.717
My office will transfer
the case files

06:53.717 --> 06:57.286
so you can see what we managed
to get on Abramov so far.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.809
I was just having
to move so fast

06:58.809 --> 07:00.420
after we learned
he was in town.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.205
Abramov is here?

07:03.205 --> 07:06.774
My ROS unit
received reliable intel

07:06.774 --> 07:09.037
that Abramov is coming
to town for 48 hours

07:09.037 --> 07:13.433
to reset some pipelines
and receive a big shipment.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.305
If we can catch him
with that gold,

07:16.305 --> 07:18.742
it's silly not to combine
resources on this, right?

07:18.742 --> 07:20.483
Sorry to interrupt.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.659
Jay's in the chair right now,
so whoever wants first crack.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.226
Thank you very much.
We'll be right there.

07:24.226 --> 07:25.749
You ready?

07:25.749 --> 07:27.751
Joint operation
with a foreign agent?

07:27.751 --> 07:29.100
There's gonna be rules.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.580
I have to get this
cleared first.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.147
She can watch.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.368
This is my case.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.631
Look, you're in New York.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.502
It's our case.

07:39.502 --> 07:43.593
But if you behave yourself,
I'll see if you can tag along.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.378
Hey, great job
in the store today.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.598
I do hope you and Jet make up.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.517
- Italian police.
- I knew it!

07:58.086 --> 08:01.568
Well, since you're the one
who set up the deal with him,

08:01.568 --> 08:02.917
anything you wanna tell me?

08:02.917 --> 08:05.136
Yes.
I'm going in there with you.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.225
No.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.618
Tia, you're not.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.491
Who is this new Elliot
following all these rules?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.797
This is not the cop I remember.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.973
Same cop, different rules.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.498
You're really gonna make me
watch?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.847
No.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.718
You can hold this too.

08:21.718 --> 08:25.026
Well, at least
put on a good show.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.158
Hey, Jay.

08:27.158 --> 08:28.508
<i>Should I get a lawyer?</i>

08:28.508 --> 08:30.161
<i>Are you asking my advice?</i>

08:30.161 --> 08:31.685
Have a seat.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.034
I've never been
arrested before.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.339
Really?

08:34.339 --> 08:35.906
Well, I got to tell you,
from where I'm standing,

08:35.906 --> 08:38.474
you seem to be holding up
pretty well.

08:38.474 --> 08:44.001
But if you want a lawyer,
then I'll get you a lawyer.

08:44.001 --> 08:46.003
I just hope he's not very good.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.788
<i>Why shouldn't
he be a good lawyer?</i>

08:47.788 --> 08:49.964
Well, if he's good,
he'll probably get you bail,

08:49.964 --> 08:52.401
and that's gonna
be awful for you.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.794
Why would that be awful?

08:55.970 --> 08:59.103
Well, Abramov has to know
you're in custody, right?

09:00.844 --> 09:03.325
The chance that no one
noticed the police foot chase

09:03.325 --> 09:05.501
in front of your store
in broad daylight,

09:05.501 --> 09:06.589
didn't alert him?

09:06.589 --> 09:08.069
Nah, he's got to know,

09:08.069 --> 09:09.636
especially with him
being in town.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.813
Abramov is here?

09:12.813 --> 09:16.381
Yeah, I mean, how do
you think he's gonna react?

09:16.381 --> 09:18.209
Gold is gone.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.472
We're not giving back
that money.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.300
You.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.521
<i>I just buy the jewelry
from his couriers.</i>

09:25.521 --> 09:27.479
I don't know where
it comes from.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.569
No, Jay.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.570
Let's not do that.

09:32.615 --> 09:35.966
Why do you think we were
in your store today?

09:35.966 --> 09:38.186
Because we got a court order
to tap your phones,

09:38.186 --> 09:42.059
and we had an informant,
former coworker.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.279
They told us everything
that you were doing.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.367
So.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.893
Was it Sarah? Janet?

09:49.893 --> 09:51.634
I'm not at liberty to say.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.941
But look, you're asking
my advice...

09:56.160 --> 09:57.161
Talk.

09:57.161 --> 09:58.641
Give me names.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.165
Or hope that if you get out,

10:01.165 --> 10:03.472
we get to Abramov
before he gets to you.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.176
So how'd I do?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.177
Who was it?

10:13.177 --> 10:14.439
Sarah or Janet?

10:14.439 --> 10:15.615
Neither.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.268
I didn't have an informant.

10:33.328 --> 10:34.982
Let's go, ladies!

10:34.982 --> 10:37.201
And no bathroom breaks today.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.913
Mikeal!

10:52.913 --> 10:54.131
I didn't know you were coming.

10:54.131 --> 10:56.699
Because I didn't
want you to know.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.658
Just like you didn't
want me to know

10:58.658 --> 11:01.878
you've been skimming
off the top here.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.141
What? No.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.535
I haven't been skimming. I--
- Hey, hey.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.971
I have my eyes here,

11:07.971 --> 11:11.235
and I make them
tell me everything, hmm?

11:11.235 --> 11:12.802
Now, listen.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.152
You've been a tremendous asset
for me this year,

11:15.152 --> 11:19.461
so perhaps you've always
deserved more.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.984
Huh?

11:20.984 --> 11:23.726
But if you really wanted
extra gold,

11:23.726 --> 11:27.034
all you had to do was ask, man.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.040
You can ask me now.

11:34.563 --> 11:38.567
It's okay, don't worry.
Just--just be polite.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.874
Huh?

11:40.874 --> 11:43.224
"Mikeal."

11:43.224 --> 11:45.443
Mikeal.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.837
"I would like..."

11:47.837 --> 11:51.449
I would like more.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.538
More what?

11:53.538 --> 11:54.670
Gold.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.063
Please.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.461
You see?

12:03.461 --> 12:05.594
It wasn't that hard, huh?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.901
Okay, give him what he wants.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.122
I didn't take anything.
I didn't take anything!

12:12.122 --> 12:14.472
I did--
- Come on! Move!

12:16.300 --> 12:18.215
Joy, right?

12:18.215 --> 12:20.000
Huh, right?

12:22.437 --> 12:24.308
Thank you, Joy.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.273
Thank you, Joy.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.462
Still in European time?

12:47.462 --> 12:50.247
I'm making coffee.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.683
Oh, great, yeah.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.598
Yeah, email it to me,
I'll look it over,

12:53.598 --> 12:55.731
and then we can meet up--

13:04.261 --> 13:06.133
Intelligence reports.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.482
Clock is ticking,
and I know you're

13:07.482 --> 13:08.918
a workaholic just like me.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.094
Come on in.

13:11.094 --> 13:14.271
Updated intel from the
contacts the jeweler gave us.

13:14.271 --> 13:15.838
Mm-kay.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.535
- Mm.
- What?

13:17.535 --> 13:19.363
- Nice place.
- Oh, you think?

13:19.363 --> 13:21.148
Yeah.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.845
Mom sleeps there.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.065
She's been on a month-long tour
staying with the grandkids,

13:25.065 --> 13:26.980
and that's Eli's old room.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.416
He's in college now.

13:28.416 --> 13:32.115
College.
- Oh, so you're a lonely bird.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.421
I'm an empty nester.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.554
I'm an empty nester, yes, I am.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.034
And, uh,
how are you adjusting?

13:38.034 --> 13:41.037
You know, I mean,
I don't miss him playing

13:41.037 --> 13:42.952
his music loud at 2:00 a.m.

13:44.649 --> 13:47.391
I meant since, uh, Kathy.

13:51.439 --> 13:54.834
I'm sorry I, uh,
I didn't hear in time and--

13:54.834 --> 13:56.009
I know.

13:56.009 --> 13:59.273
And you called,
and I got your messages.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.539
Sorry I didn't call back.
I just didn't have the words.

14:04.539 --> 14:05.888
I didn't know what to--

14:08.325 --> 14:09.892
Didn't know what to say.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.809
So thank you.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.726
You two were
special together.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.078
You're special.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.344
Want some coffee?

14:27.344 --> 14:29.433
Espresso.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.131
- Coffee.
- Cappuccino?

14:31.131 --> 14:33.350
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.787
So what's, uh,
what's the intel there?

14:35.787 --> 14:39.356
Ah, surveillance photos,
a couple of new addresses.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.490
Since we're in a
sharin' kind of mood,

14:42.490 --> 14:43.578
do you want to tell me
what you're really doing

14:43.578 --> 14:44.971
in the States?

14:50.237 --> 14:52.979
Look, I've been where you are.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.416
Obsessed with a case.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.896
So I know.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.855
I know.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.991
I had him.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.993
Abramov?

15:06.993 --> 15:08.385
Two years ago.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.737
An associate of his came
to see me with information.

15:12.737 --> 15:16.959
I offered protection
to have him testify,

15:16.959 --> 15:21.007
but before it got approved,
Abramov killed the man's

15:21.007 --> 15:25.315
wife and two children.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.802
After that,
the whole thing fell apart.

15:38.894 --> 15:41.201
It was my fault.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.985
No. No.

15:47.555 --> 15:51.863
We have 48 hours
to catch this monster,

15:51.863 --> 15:55.302
and I'm not leaving
without him.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.477
Okay.

15:58.435 --> 16:01.525
You had my back when I was over
there, I got your back now.

16:05.442 --> 16:06.574
Do you have a plan?

16:06.574 --> 16:08.968
Yes, I do.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.099
<i>No, you don't.</i>

16:10.099 --> 16:11.535
You didn't let me finish.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.233
Setting up a new connection
at Abramov's circle?

16:13.233 --> 16:14.756
No, that is too risky.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.410
Well, it's riskier
to just pick him up.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.194
We don't have anything to
charge him with that'll stick

16:18.194 --> 16:19.500
before he leaves the country.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.980
Either we turn someone
on the inside,

16:20.980 --> 16:23.373
or we catch him doing
something dirty.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.767
What do you propose?

16:25.767 --> 16:27.638
I've spent months
working my channels

16:27.638 --> 16:29.989
to get close to his operation,
so I know

16:29.989 --> 16:33.079
he always needs new buyers
for his supply chain.

16:33.079 --> 16:38.519
I set up a meet, we expose him,
we take him down, basta.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.260
Well, your face has been
all over the news

16:40.260 --> 16:43.002
after the Brotherhood trial,
so I can't send you inside.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.786
- All right, I mean...
- Send me.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.268
Send me.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.625
Can you wire him up,
set up surveillance?

16:57.625 --> 17:00.149
Whatever you need,
including online identity.

17:02.847 --> 17:05.372
Why haven't I heard back
from your office?

17:05.372 --> 17:07.635
Probably time zone difference.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.028
And I know they're swamped.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.078
If we're gonna do this,
we need all hands on deck,

17:16.078 --> 17:18.385
so get moving.
Where's Jamie?

17:18.385 --> 17:19.342
He's running
an errand for me.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.778
He'll be back in 30.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.701
Mrs. Silas.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.486
Detective Whalen.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.140
Excuse me?

17:34.140 --> 17:36.142
Detective Stabler
really wanted to come,

17:36.142 --> 17:39.841
but he got caught up in a case,
so he sent me to talk to you.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.582
Well, I was very clear
with him on the phone

17:41.582 --> 17:44.367
that I'm only interested in
his help because I'm sharing--

17:44.367 --> 17:46.282
Very sensitive information.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.110
Yeah, he told me everything.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.807
He also told me
to tell you that when

17:49.807 --> 17:52.288
you're talking with me,
you're talking to him.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.772
Well, then,
Detective Stabler,

17:57.772 --> 18:00.514
I will reach out
at a later date.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.516
And I'm very disappointed.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.692
It's about your husband, right?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.871
I got a little back story
before I came.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.700
Girl from Queens picks
herself up by the bootstraps,

18:12.700 --> 18:16.269
marries the most eligible
bachelor in New York,

18:16.269 --> 18:19.924
and suddenly realizes what
she's gotten herself into.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.927
Her penthouse becomes a prison.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.147
But it's Teddy who should
be behind bars, isn't it?

18:27.106 --> 18:29.717
Detective Stabler
tell you all that?

18:29.717 --> 18:31.110
Am I wrong? If

18:32.720 --> 18:35.026
I'm wrong, then I'm sorry,

18:35.026 --> 18:38.900
and I'll be happy to relay your
message back to the office.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.858
I have to be very careful.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.342
My husband is a dangerous man.

18:48.953 --> 18:52.131
He had something to do
with Henry's death, didn't he?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.698
Look, we can give you
protection if you need it--

18:54.698 --> 18:56.613
I can take care
of myself right now.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.312
Okay.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.931
Here's a thumb drive.
It explains everything--

19:09.931 --> 19:14.065
financing, mob connections,
the undocumented labor,

19:14.065 --> 19:16.155
all the way back to Macau.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.119
Oh, and you can tell
Detective Stabler

19:24.119 --> 19:26.208
I've been keeping my eyes open.

19:34.477 --> 19:37.088
So I'm Abramov now.

19:38.612 --> 19:39.961
Nice to meet you.

19:39.961 --> 19:42.616
My friend,
I am Christos Georgalas.

19:42.616 --> 19:43.965
The pleasure is mine.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.228
I measure a man
by what he drinks.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.229
What are you having?

19:47.229 --> 19:48.665
I'm your guest.

19:48.665 --> 19:51.146
Whatever suits you.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.800
I'm almost done setting up
your online profile,

19:52.800 --> 19:54.323
personal history, family,
that sort of thing.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.934
Do you want me
to text you the details?

19:56.934 --> 20:00.764
The point is, you knew
she was on a rogue mission.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.462
I knew she was following
a lead and late

20:02.462 --> 20:03.593
in reporting to her superior.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.334
She's a good cop.
I'll vouch for her.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.901
All right,
what's so special about her

20:06.901 --> 20:09.860
that you're willing
to put yourself on the line?

20:09.860 --> 20:11.949
There was a time in Italy
that I just

20:11.949 --> 20:13.168
didn't want to
do the job anymore.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.648
I was burnt out, and she just--

20:14.648 --> 20:16.650
she helped me get my mojo back.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.218
And we got close.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.132
Kathy loved her.
Hey, how'd it go?

20:21.132 --> 20:22.786
Great.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.353
Fill you in on that later.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.964
Great suit.
- Thanks. That's all Rocco.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.879
Hey, I got a wedding
coming up, can I get a card?

20:28.879 --> 20:30.141
I'm retired, kid.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.274
This is a favor to Elliot.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.407
Okay, we got ten.
You prepared?

20:34.407 --> 20:35.886
Don't I look it?

20:35.886 --> 20:37.714
The most important thing:
don't force the issue.

20:37.714 --> 20:40.021
He may already think
the police is on to him.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.762
All right,
we're gonna have ears on you

20:41.762 --> 20:43.503
the whole time,
but if something happens,

20:43.503 --> 20:45.853
what do you say?

20:45.853 --> 20:48.203
Would anyone like dessert?

20:51.815 --> 20:53.730
I forgot to say
I'm sorry, by the way.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.646
At the jewelry store.

20:56.646 --> 20:59.040
That thing I said about
your parents not paying.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.043
I was just trying
to ad-lib some character.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.219
- I didn't mind.
- Oh, yeah, you did.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.742
You did.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.004
Look, yesterday was awkward.

21:07.004 --> 21:10.747
Let's just admit it
and move on.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.059
My parents didn't pay
for my wedding.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.061
Just struck a nerve,
that's all.

21:21.758 --> 21:22.716
Wait, you're married?

21:22.716 --> 21:23.847
Was.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.722
I was 20.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.767
Huge mistake.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.729
My dad still won't talk to me.

21:40.255 --> 21:43.476
Anyway, we should probably,
um--

21:49.090 --> 21:51.614
My friend,
the beach is a paradise.

21:51.614 --> 21:54.400
When you come to Donousa,
you will be my guest.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.792
The fish, so fresh.

21:55.792 --> 21:56.967
The women--
- Even fresher?

21:56.967 --> 21:58.360
More delicious.

22:00.580 --> 22:01.798
L'chaim.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.111
So.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.594
You've been vouched for.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.117
Yeah.

22:16.117 --> 22:19.033
Your business, your father
and uncle started it, right?

22:19.033 --> 22:20.991
<i>That's right, yeah.</i>

22:20.991 --> 22:23.603
<i>And you,
London School of Economics,</i>

22:23.603 --> 22:27.868
six years in the Greek Army,
never been married.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.913
- Yeah.
- Christos, I do my homework.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.703
If I may, my father
used to say...

22:36.703 --> 22:38.182
Uh-huh.

22:38.182 --> 22:39.445
"In America, the streets
are paved with gold,

22:39.445 --> 22:41.316
but someone has to do
the paving."

22:41.316 --> 22:43.579
Yeah.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.233
Your father was a smart man.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.499
You okay?

22:50.499 --> 22:53.197
Isn't she just delicious?

22:53.197 --> 22:56.592
What is your name?

22:56.592 --> 22:59.160
It's Joy. Okay, Joy.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.770
Don't be late tomorrow.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.816
We have a lot to get done, okay?

23:05.819 --> 23:07.603
So--
- Oh!

23:07.603 --> 23:09.866
Look.

23:10.911 --> 23:13.261
Damn.

23:13.261 --> 23:16.525
Sorry, it's just, I told you,
it drives me crazy.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.399
Are we in business?

23:26.056 --> 23:27.536
Uh, maybe.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.062
Probably, yeah.

23:32.062 --> 23:34.543
I'll get back to you
about timing.

23:34.543 --> 23:37.198
Why wait?

23:37.198 --> 23:38.852
No time like the present.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.244
Pushing too hard.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.031
Yeah.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.688
But you will have to wait.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.437
Yeah.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.310
We'll be in touch.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.400
Absolutely.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.556
You almost got made in there.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.296
I had to take a chance.

24:32.296 --> 24:34.603
You said if we couldn't catch
Abramov doing something dirty,

24:34.603 --> 24:38.085
then we had to have someone
on the inside turn on him.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.565
But there's a girl in there.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.915
Has to be a part of his
jewelry-making operation.

24:41.915 --> 24:44.570
I get her to talk,
she's our way in.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.310
Why do you think
she's a part of the operation?

24:46.310 --> 24:47.703
Her hands were green.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.575
If you're iron deficient
and you work with gold,

24:49.575 --> 24:50.619
it stains the skin.

24:53.535 --> 24:56.146
Think you can get her
to talk?

24:56.146 --> 24:57.539
I think so.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.888
You have to.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.499
We have no other option.

25:04.459 --> 25:05.460
Go.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.429
Joy.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.301
Yes, I thought that was you.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.085
No. No, no, it's okay, please.

25:22.085 --> 25:24.610
No, don't be afraid.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.481
Can I ask you something?

25:29.092 --> 25:30.964
Do you like your job
at the restaurant?

25:32.487 --> 25:34.097
Because I get the sense
that you're a little uneasy

25:34.097 --> 25:35.534
about the whole thing.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.153
I can't talk.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.024
Why? Because of him?

25:48.024 --> 25:49.809
Abramov?

25:49.809 --> 25:52.289
If you're in any trouble,
I can help you.

25:52.289 --> 25:53.247
How?

25:55.858 --> 25:58.774
I'm here
with other officers as well.

25:58.774 --> 26:01.516
<i>We know about your boss
and how dangerous he is.</i>

26:03.474 --> 26:05.999
I saw him have a man killed.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.827
Who? Where?

26:07.827 --> 26:10.830
In the factory, where I work.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.614
I don't know his name.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.834
He was the one
who made us work all day.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.313
No food.

26:16.313 --> 26:18.533
Not even water.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.535
Can you tell me
about this factory?

26:22.363 --> 26:25.540
It's more than just
a jewelry-making factory.

26:25.540 --> 26:30.110
He smuggles girls in
to do the work.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.373
They abuse us.

26:32.373 --> 26:35.811
<i>He said if I tell them when
someone was stealing from him,</i>

26:35.811 --> 26:38.509
he would let me work
at the restaurant.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.642
Make extra money.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.645
I have a daughter back home.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.300
How many of you are there?

26:46.300 --> 26:49.825
12, sometimes more.

26:49.825 --> 26:52.088
Can you tell me
where this factory is?

26:52.088 --> 26:54.525
I can't.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.876
We're blindfolded
when they bring us.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.228
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

27:04.100 --> 27:05.232
Hi.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.537
Whoa, sorry, sorry, sorry.

27:06.537 --> 27:07.538
I didn't mean to startle you.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.802
I think I can help. Reyes?

27:09.802 --> 27:11.194
<i>Yeah, she's police,
don't worry.</i>

27:11.194 --> 27:12.848
It's okay.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.851
Joy, if you can tell me
every detail

27:15.851 --> 27:17.940
of that van ride
that you remember,

27:17.940 --> 27:21.988
like how long it was,
sounds you heard, smells,

27:21.988 --> 27:24.207
I think that I might
be able to help.

27:26.819 --> 27:30.997
Just--just start from
the very beginning, okay?

27:33.913 --> 27:37.568
They picked us up from JFK.

27:37.568 --> 27:40.876
<i>We drove for maybe one hour.</i>

27:40.876 --> 27:45.228
<i>We were driving slowly
for a long time.</i>

27:45.228 --> 27:47.274
<i>Maybe 10 miles an hour.</i>

27:50.364 --> 27:54.063
<i>When we got there,
I couldn't see anything.</i>

27:54.063 --> 27:56.675
<i>I could only hear
the sound of a foghorn.</i>

28:03.159 --> 28:05.509
<i>I see a sign on the building.</i>

28:05.509 --> 28:10.297
<i>The letters L-I-T-A-N.</i>

28:15.911 --> 28:17.957
There's a Metropolitan
Plastic within the radius.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.916
Last five letters--
- L-I-T-A-N. Yeah.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.744
All right,
let's see what's around it.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.267
What else?

28:24.267 --> 28:26.269
There's a property next to it
that's owned

28:26.269 --> 28:28.924
by a holding company,
Monte Cinto Holdings.

28:30.404 --> 28:31.753
Monte Cinto.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.886
ROS intelligence reports.

28:33.886 --> 28:36.889
They mine gold in China,
Russia, and Northeast Africa.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.325
It's a front company.

28:38.325 --> 28:39.848
Which means
that's probably where

28:39.848 --> 28:40.893
they're holding the girls.
- Jet.

28:40.893 --> 28:43.330
Get the address?
Already done.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.419
- That was impressive.
- Thank you.

28:45.419 --> 28:48.727
If you're ever thinking of
moving to Italy, come see me.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.587
Team 3, clear.

29:23.587 --> 29:26.503
- Any sign of the women?
- They must have been moved.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.679
<i>It looks like
they pulled out, Bell.</i>

29:28.679 --> 29:29.855
All right, all clear.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.422
All clear!

29:36.862 --> 29:38.428
You smell that?

29:53.879 --> 29:56.533
What do you got?

29:56.533 --> 29:57.926
Is that a...?

30:09.329 --> 30:10.417
Gold.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.166
There's too much
cross-contamination

30:20.166 --> 30:21.558
in this place.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.038
I mean, we're printing
around the furnace,

30:23.038 --> 30:25.649
see what we can find,
but they probably used gloves.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.564
All right.
Get back in here.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.349
I want you
off the streets for now.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.612
- We still don't have anything?
- Nope.

30:31.612 --> 30:34.571
All we can do is tie Abramov
to a building with a skull

30:34.571 --> 30:36.486
in the furnace,
which he's gonna claim

30:36.486 --> 30:38.053
he knows nothing about.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.577
A bigger problem is,
now he knows we're on to him,

30:40.577 --> 30:42.753
and he's gonna run.
<i>Caspita!</i>

30:42.753 --> 30:44.233
Okay, well, we're still
waiting on dental analysis,

30:44.233 --> 30:45.887
so we got that.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.019
What's up, Jet?

30:47.019 --> 30:48.890
Forensic analysis came in.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.110
Particles of gold dust
found in the factory

30:51.110 --> 30:52.589
and on the skull
of our John Doe

30:52.589 --> 30:55.201
traced back to a mine
in Abu Hamad, Sudan,

30:55.201 --> 30:56.419
which is in Northeast Africa,

30:56.419 --> 30:59.466
where Monte Cinto
has its gold mines.

30:59.466 --> 31:01.816
Well, we know Sudan's
in bed with Abramov.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.165
Maybe that's how
he's getting his gold

31:03.165 --> 31:04.558
into the States undetected.

31:04.558 --> 31:07.082
The only way to do that
is to control the flights

31:07.082 --> 31:08.344
from point to point.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.303
Yeah, government
security clearance.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.913
Or diplomatic immunity.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.001
Sudanese consulate?

31:13.001 --> 31:15.395
- I'll drive.
- No, no, I'll drive.

31:15.395 --> 31:16.700
This is New York,
you're gonna get us killed.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.267
No, no.
You drive too slow.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.834
Well, this time
I'll drive faster.

31:21.531 --> 31:23.620
If Abramov tries
to fly out on an A1,

31:23.620 --> 31:25.492
he'll be assigned
a diplomatic clearance number.

31:25.492 --> 31:27.059
But then the flight numbers
on the manifest

31:27.059 --> 31:28.190
become public record.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.452
No, If he thinks
we're on to him,

31:29.452 --> 31:30.932
he's gonna go underground.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.934
It doesn't matter.
We're closing in.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.109
We're gonna get him.

31:34.109 --> 31:36.459
I knew you'd never quit.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.244
What, going after Abramov?
Hell no.

31:38.244 --> 31:41.290
No, back in Italy, when you
said you were burned out,

31:41.290 --> 31:42.988
but you can never quit.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.033
You were born for this job.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.687
It's what I admire about you.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.083
I don't know
Mikeal Abramov at all.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.258
Why would I?

31:52.258 --> 31:53.346
Well,
maybe because he smuggles

31:53.346 --> 31:55.565
a lot of gold out
of your country

31:55.565 --> 31:57.350
with the help
of public officials.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.047
Traces of gold
from your region

31:59.047 --> 32:01.180
were found in a
murder scene with ties

32:01.180 --> 32:04.096
to a human trafficking ring
that Mr. Abramov runs.

32:04.096 --> 32:07.142
So you think
I have something to do with it.

32:07.142 --> 32:08.883
No, not you personally.

32:08.883 --> 32:11.364
But we have reason to believe
the embassy has been asked

32:11.364 --> 32:13.714
to help in Abramov's travel.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.150
Unknowingly, of course.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.804
Oh.

32:16.804 --> 32:19.502
So would you like
if I called my prime minister

32:19.502 --> 32:21.069
to ask if that's the case?

32:21.069 --> 32:23.028
If you think it would help.

32:27.554 --> 32:28.685
You went to Queens College?

32:28.685 --> 32:30.557
It's a good school.

32:30.557 --> 32:34.387
I just sent my kid off
to Colorado.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.911
What brought you
to New York originally?

32:36.911 --> 32:38.130
Opportunity.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.653
Yeah, well,
you're in the right place.

32:39.653 --> 32:40.871
Look where you are, right?

32:40.871 --> 32:43.265
In a position to help
people back home.

32:43.265 --> 32:44.745
That's why I do my job.

32:44.745 --> 32:47.400
I'm trying to help people.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.056
People that are hurt,
being exploited.

32:53.014 --> 32:55.625
Mr. Deng,
if we don't stop this man,

32:55.625 --> 32:59.194
a lot of people, especially
young women, will suffer.

33:06.201 --> 33:07.768
I understand.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.857
As I'm sure you also
understand the risk

33:09.857 --> 33:12.077
I will be taking
in providing you

33:12.077 --> 33:14.601
with very sensitive
government information.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.999
Which is why I will
have to ask you to leave.

33:27.266 --> 33:30.617
But if you don't mind,
I would like to exit first.

33:32.488 --> 33:35.709
So you can have time to discuss

33:35.709 --> 33:37.711
where you might
need to go next.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.149
Thank you for your help.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.199
It's a flight manifest.

33:47.199 --> 33:50.028
Abramov's flight
leaves in 45 minutes.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.072
Let's go.

33:53.509 --> 33:55.076
Five minutes out
from the airport, Sarge.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.251
Where are you?

33:56.251 --> 33:58.079
We should get there
at the same time.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.559
Where are we on backup?

33:59.559 --> 34:01.082
HIS and ESU are in transit.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.693
Looks like they're
about four minutes out.

34:06.827 --> 34:09.830
Yeah, we're landing
at about 1:00.

34:09.830 --> 34:13.138
No, because we are taking
off earlier, that's why.

34:17.968 --> 34:18.969
Hurry.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.234
You too.

34:22.234 --> 34:23.452
Yes, sir.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.638
There he is.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.858
We have to move.
Move, move, move, move.

34:55.919 --> 34:56.790
Hey!

34:56.790 --> 34:58.400
You said you'd be ready, huh?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.359
Come on.
We have to move quicker.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.714
Come on, we don't have time.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.069
Cops, cops! Get your guns!

35:24.209 --> 35:25.645
Police!

35:25.645 --> 35:27.516
- Show me your hands!
- Drop your weapon.

35:27.516 --> 35:28.952
Drop your weapon!

35:48.146 --> 35:49.451
Man down!

35:49.451 --> 35:51.018
Hey! Cover me!

35:55.240 --> 35:56.850
No! No, go inside.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.939
Start the engine. Go inside!

36:03.204 --> 36:04.249
Go, go, go.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.206
Take us out of here.

36:29.622 --> 36:32.015
Mikeal Abramov,
you're under arrest.

36:32.015 --> 36:33.452
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.454
If you give up that right,
anything you say can

36:35.454 --> 36:37.543
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.022
Turn around.

36:39.022 --> 36:41.590
You have the right
to an attorney.

36:41.590 --> 36:46.073
If you can't afford one,
one would be appointed for you.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.949
You haven't been
answering my texts.

37:35.949 --> 37:38.604
You know I do that
when I'm trying to think.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.999
And what was that precious
mind thinking about today?

37:44.653 --> 37:48.353
Huh?
- Going away somewhere.

37:48.353 --> 37:51.965
Paris, maybe. Someplace warm.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.401
I love that.

37:54.881 --> 37:58.450
Hey, maybe we can ask my dad
if we can borrow the jet.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.321
He's not gonna mind.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.979
What if we never came back?

38:07.546 --> 38:08.982
To New York?

38:08.982 --> 38:15.423
New York, the casino,
your father, all of it.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.648
- I'm serious.
- Yeah.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.040
We have the money.
We can start over--

38:24.040 --> 38:27.609
What's going on
with you right now?

38:29.959 --> 38:32.353
You never feel that way
sometimes?

38:32.353 --> 38:36.009
We are this close to opening
a billion dollar casino

38:36.009 --> 38:37.706
in the greatest city
in the world.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.839
No. No.

38:39.839 --> 38:42.668
No, I don't ever
feel that way at all.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.234
What, is it that time
of the month for you?

38:44.234 --> 38:45.627
Is that what this is?

38:48.456 --> 38:50.502
Why don't you just
take a warm bath

38:50.502 --> 38:51.894
and try to relax, all right?

38:51.894 --> 38:54.027
I know it's a lot
of pressure, but--

38:54.027 --> 38:56.377
You don't know the pressure
I'm dealing with.

39:13.699 --> 39:15.875
<i>♪ Looking back on it all</i>

39:18.486 --> 39:21.054
<i>♪ Those pockets
full of dreams ♪</i>

39:22.664 --> 39:24.405
<i>♪ I know we gave it
our best shot, baby ♪</i>

39:37.940 --> 39:39.899
Kind of late
for you, isn't it?

39:39.899 --> 39:42.162
<i>You never sleep
after a big bust.</i>

39:42.162 --> 39:44.512
<i>Too much adrenaline.</i>

39:44.512 --> 39:49.299
Yeah. Good work today.

39:49.299 --> 39:50.518
<i>You too.</i>

39:50.518 --> 39:53.782
<i>Felt good working
as a team again.</i>

39:53.782 --> 39:55.654
Yeah.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.351
So when do you leave?

39:57.351 --> 39:59.353
<i>Are you trying
to get rid of me already?</i>

39:59.353 --> 40:01.442
No, I'm--

40:01.442 --> 40:03.705
Just worried about you.

40:03.705 --> 40:05.751
And, I mean,
I know you got a lot

40:05.751 --> 40:07.796
waiting for you
when you go home.

40:07.796 --> 40:11.104
<i>Partly why I don't
want to go back.</i>

40:11.104 --> 40:12.497
What's the other part?

40:12.497 --> 40:14.020
<i>You.</i>

40:15.935 --> 40:19.982
<i>I mean, there's still
cleanup work to do here,</i>

40:19.982 --> 40:22.245
<i>so I figured
I should stick around.</i>

40:22.245 --> 40:26.032
<i>Make sure you don't
take credit for my work.</i>

40:26.032 --> 40:27.381
Exactly.

40:27.381 --> 40:28.600
<i>You at home right now?</i>

40:28.600 --> 40:33.169
<i>'Cause, uh, I could sure
use a drink.</i>

40:33.169 --> 40:35.171
Well, where you at?

40:35.171 --> 40:36.477
<i>I'm outside your door.</i>

40:59.500 --> 41:01.633
Elliot.

41:01.633 --> 41:04.026
Are you going to let me in?
