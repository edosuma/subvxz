WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:14.960
MADRID, SPAIN

00:18.800 --> 00:21.080
- Mom!
- I love you.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.000
- Give me a kiss.

00:23.080 --> 00:26.080
- Mommy, where are you going?
- Come on, a kiss.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.160
- What happened?

00:30.160 --> 00:32.519
Okay, I'll be back.
I'm going to get a Kinder egg.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.839
She's bringing an egg.

00:35.559 --> 00:37.160
I love you, sweetie.

00:41.199 --> 00:43.640
Mwah! Okay, I'll be back, okay?

00:44.520 --> 00:48.320
The Euro Cup is starting
and Portugal is going all in.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.280
- Good morning, Ms. Georgina.
- Good morning.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.680
Where are we going?

00:52.760 --> 00:54.680
We're going to Budapest, right?

00:54.760 --> 00:56.760
- You're ready, aren't you?
- So ready!

00:58.199 --> 01:01.239
Well, I'm Toni and, well,
I'm Gio's friend above all.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.519
She's a person I can trust 100%,

01:04.599 --> 01:07.800
even in the moments
that I needed her the most.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.200
So I consider her a great friend.

01:12.680 --> 01:16.479
Well, maybe I'll get a little cheeky
and tell your dad to keep the jersey.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.520
So he can give it to me.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.960
What do you think, Gio?

01:25.560 --> 01:27.800
- Okay then…
- I'm talking to Cris.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.080
I'm telling him
we're on the way to the airport.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.560
Tell him to ask Mbappé for his shirt
for Cris at the end of the match.

01:36.119 --> 01:37.479
Okay, once we get there.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.720
Otherwise, he forgets and gets angry
if I ask too many times.

01:41.160 --> 01:44.240
Before the Euro Cup,
Cristiano is super concentrated,

01:44.320 --> 01:45.320
super focused.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.080
Men in the back,
and women to the front.

02:01.039 --> 02:02.440
Well then, let's go, guys.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.160
We should make a bet.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.680
It's just that
I can't talk about today's bet.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.480
Why?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.040
Gio wants to go on a beach vacation.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.000
Nana and Miguel Paixão…

02:25.080 --> 02:29.080
Paixão is Cristiano's best friend.
He's like his brother.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.120
They met when they were 12 years old.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.080
They went
to the Sporting Academy together.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.239
He's a very important person
to Cristiano, and also to me,

02:37.320 --> 02:39.760
because he's always been good to me.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.560
- Has to…
- Let's see, it's that he's…

02:42.640 --> 02:45.920
- He's super.
- He's breaking the soccer standard.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.239
Because, normally,
you'd retire at 33, or at 30.

02:49.320 --> 02:54.000
Cristiano is 36,
but he's like a 24 or 25-year-old.

02:54.080 --> 02:58.480
In fact, too many young people
are not lucky enough to be in his shape.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.320
It's not luck, it's hard work.

03:02.239 --> 03:04.000
He has sacrificed his life a little bit.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.679
- Because after a game--
- Right.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.640
We're young, we have money, we could say,

03:09.280 --> 03:10.840
"Let's take the plane and go to London,

03:10.920 --> 03:13.920
or go to Paris
to a restaurant, or a concert."

03:14.640 --> 03:16.000
And we don't do it.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.440
We go home to our kids, eat and rest…

03:20.640 --> 03:23.360
Soccer takes away
a lot of your life, okay?

03:23.840 --> 03:26.239
People can say,
"Players earn a lot of money."

03:26.880 --> 03:30.840
But in reality, our life is
very restricted. Very restricted.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.200
And I put everything
to be at the top of my game,

03:34.280 --> 03:35.600
physically and mentally.

03:35.679 --> 03:37.480
So, I do a bit more.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.280
Not just on training days,
but for efficiency.

03:40.840 --> 03:44.799
I mean, not 24 hours,
but a lot of the time of the day.

03:46.399 --> 03:50.560
You spend a lot of hours a day
on your body, your mind…

03:51.600 --> 03:53.079
You commit yourself to your job.

03:55.519 --> 03:58.399
Then-- Oh, we have to talk
about something.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.679
- Do you remember--
- The wedding? The wedding.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.480
- No…

04:03.560 --> 04:04.399
The wedding--

04:04.480 --> 04:06.799
- There's so much planning…
- It's not up to me. I wish!

04:06.880 --> 04:07.720
…in a castle.

04:07.799 --> 04:10.799
Someone sent you a catalog
from a wedding planner business.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.760
To be honest, I don't think our situation
would change drastically

04:13.839 --> 04:15.959
because I feel really loved.

04:16.039 --> 04:18.680
I have what matters the most
with Cristiano.

04:18.760 --> 04:22.079
Our wonderful kids
and the love I get from him every day.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.479
It doesn't matter.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.840
No, I don't have space for any more rings.

04:25.920 --> 04:26.880
- For real.
- Yeah.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.000
Do you remember that year when I did this
and they said he had proposed to me?

04:31.080 --> 04:33.960
They're always joking about the wedding.
"When is the wedding?"

04:34.039 --> 04:37.960
Since Jennifer Lopez's song
"The Ring Or When" came out,

04:38.039 --> 04:39.560
they started singing it to me.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.440
And well, this is not up to me.

04:42.599 --> 04:45.360
I always tell her,
"When we get that click."

04:45.440 --> 04:49.280
Like everything with our life,
and she knows what I'm talking about.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.919
It could be in a year, or it could be
in six months or it could be in a month.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.120
I'm 1,000% sure that it'll happen.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.000
BUDAPEST, HUNGARY

05:02.360 --> 05:04.680
Whoo! It's hot!

05:06.320 --> 05:08.160
- How was the flight?
- Good, thank you.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.960
How's everything, Mom?

05:13.039 --> 05:15.000
- Remember?
- What a birthday present.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.080
Good, good. Very well.
We've arrived here in Hungary.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.200
Damn it!

05:34.120 --> 05:36.280
All my friends are football fanatics.

05:36.359 --> 05:38.520
And they live it intensely.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.960
Bring the pink suitcase.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.640
Crank up the air conditioner.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.400
- I could take a good nap.
- Yeah.

05:55.479 --> 05:56.840
- Yes?
- To sleep.

05:56.919 --> 05:59.359
Yes, ten minutes, right? Or five.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.520
My name is Julia.
I'm one of Georgina's friends.

06:02.599 --> 06:04.880
What time is it?
I don't even know the time.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.320
How long do we have?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.680
- It's 18:08.
- Oh, well…

06:08.760 --> 06:10.560
Since I don't see her very often,

06:10.640 --> 06:13.640
when I'm with her,
I try to make the best of it.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.000
Either going for a hamburger,

06:17.080 --> 06:22.039
or simply sitting on a sofa,
chatting and laughing at a bunch of stuff.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.880
- Start getting ready and then…
- Wake me up at five to 7:00.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.000
Better for us.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.039
We don't need much time.

06:29.799 --> 06:31.760
- But we are the most--
- I won't.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.120
Worst case scenario,
I'll take a French shower.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.320
The Polish one.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.160
- It's true.
- The Polish bath.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.720
The Polish bath is a bath
where you clean the…

06:40.799 --> 06:42.799
and the…

06:43.320 --> 06:45.240
- What was it? How was it?
- Elena, Polish bath?

06:45.320 --> 06:47.799
- How was the Polish bath?
- No, I'm taking a shower.

06:47.880 --> 06:48.720
It can be seen!

06:48.799 --> 06:50.640
The pussy, the bum and the armpit.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.680
People can go to the Internet
and search it.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.560
"What's that Polish bath thing?"

06:55.880 --> 06:57.840
Hon, what dress should I wear?

06:57.919 --> 06:59.840
This five-year-old dress I've never worn?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.120
You'll have to take Polish baths
every five minutes.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.560
- You'll sweat even from your liver.
- Yeah, right?

07:04.640 --> 07:07.479
No, don't think so.
I think I'll sweat more in this one.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.400
I mean, this one is corduroy,
at 37 degrees…

07:10.479 --> 07:12.720
- Hon, it's summer velvet.
- Is it velvet?

07:12.799 --> 07:14.039
Look, it's Lycra.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.239
- They are options.
- Or this one.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.080
But this might be too provocative.

07:18.919 --> 07:21.880
I brought a dress selection
and of course everyone said,

07:21.960 --> 07:23.840
"Wear that one. Wear the denim dress."

07:23.919 --> 07:27.680
And I thought, "If I was to wear
that super sexy dress,

07:27.760 --> 07:29.799
I'll be in the bleachers,
and it's been ages

07:29.880 --> 07:31.320
since I saw my partner."

07:31.400 --> 07:34.520
So I'm gonna distract him
and then it'll be my fault.

07:34.599 --> 07:37.479
Not to distract him,
just so you can look attractive.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.799
- Yes?
- We'd better not lose!

07:46.200 --> 07:48.200
In the bathroom, the makeup's there.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.520
Take out the Louis Vuitton if you want.

07:52.159 --> 07:53.840
And we are pretty much ready to go.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.200
Well, this dress…

07:59.280 --> 08:01.280
- Whose Mickey face mask is that?
- Mine.

08:01.359 --> 08:03.400
- Can I help you?
- How are you?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.840
I think we'll win,
and Cris will score goals.

08:17.799 --> 08:20.080
Not one. A few.

08:20.159 --> 08:23.239
Are they already here?
Are the boys warming up?

08:24.919 --> 08:26.280
What time are they arriving?

08:26.799 --> 08:28.719
- It will start in 20 minutes.
- Ah.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.799
<i>Whenever I enter the stadium</i>
<i>to see Cristiano's match,</i>

08:32.880 --> 08:35.199
<i>I always think, "God protect him,</i>

08:35.280 --> 08:38.000
<i>enlighten him, help him to win."</i>

08:41.199 --> 08:44.159
<i>Great atmosphere at</i>
<i>the Puskás arena with 60,000 spectators.</i>

08:44.240 --> 08:45.400
<i>The stars are coming out.</i>

08:45.480 --> 08:48.720
<i>Rui Patrício at the Portugal goal,</i>
<i>sidelines, Bernardo Silva,</i>

08:48.800 --> 08:50.640
<i>Diogo Jota playing as the number nine.</i>

08:50.720 --> 08:53.680
<i>The captain, with the number seven</i>
<i>on his back, Cristiano Ronaldo!</i>

08:53.760 --> 08:54.720
<i>Ronaldo!</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:08.000
Let's go!

09:08.079 --> 09:10.280
I feel like Portugal is my second home,

09:10.360 --> 09:13.199
and I feel loved
by all the Portuguese people.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.000
And I feel that it's my country too.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.640
I consider myself a citizen of the world,

09:18.720 --> 09:22.199
but above all, from Portugal,
Spain, and Argentina.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.079
<i> There it goes.</i>
<i>Cristiano Ronaldo has scored three goals</i>

09:25.160 --> 09:27.079
<i>and he's looking for his fourth</i>
<i>to be </i>Pichichi.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.800
<i>He wants 108.</i>

09:28.880 --> 09:32.440
<i>The crowd at the Puskás knows it.</i>
<i>There he goes, Cristiano, goal!</i>

09:35.839 --> 09:39.320
Cristiano is, without a doubt,
the best player in the world.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.880
I think it'll be hard to surpass him.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.880
<i> This is the end</i>
<i>of the game in Hungary.</i>

09:46.959 --> 09:48.640
<i>France two, Portugal two!</i>

09:49.920 --> 09:52.240
Well, at the end it was a draw.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.760
Wonderful result against France,
one of the strongest teams.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.720
Next stop, Sevilla.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.640
Belgium will face Portugal.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.640
Well, well, well.

10:17.440 --> 10:18.600
Ronaldo!

10:19.199 --> 10:23.199
Depending on the country and the stadium,
we have different types of entrances.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.320
In Hungary, we didn't have
a direct entrance.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.839
What happens is that you've got
Cristiano's partner and Cristiano's son.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.480
It becomes overwhelming.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.760
We lost them.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.240
Someone put out
their cigarette on me.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.760
- I know, sweetie.
- Ronaldo Júnior! Ronaldo!

10:43.839 --> 10:45.000
Cristiano!

10:45.079 --> 10:47.040
It's a continued avalanche,

10:47.640 --> 10:50.079
and sometimes, of course, you are afraid,

10:50.160 --> 10:53.360
because you don't know if it's a fan
who wants to take a picture,

10:53.440 --> 10:55.839
or a lunatic
who wants to hurt you, you know?

10:57.959 --> 10:59.560
Come, Cristiano.

11:01.760 --> 11:02.800
Where's Julia?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.320
Cristiano!

11:12.000 --> 11:13.480
Let's go, guys.

11:13.560 --> 11:17.280
I get really scared,
and even more so when I'm with my son.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.360
- Disoriented.
- They arrived?

11:22.560 --> 11:23.800
How ridiculous.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.800
Are you already on vacation?

11:27.880 --> 11:29.320
- Not yet, no.
- No?

11:29.400 --> 11:31.560
- No, we're going to Sevilla.
- Oh, Sevilla.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.280
- The next one.
- Oh!

11:33.360 --> 11:36.040
We bumped into Cora,
the wife of Benzema,

11:36.120 --> 11:38.839
Cristiano's teammate at Real Madrid.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.800
I remember meeting her in the box
after she'd just had the baby.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.880
- Cris, take a picture with him.
- I'll take a picture of you guys.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.680
The best picture ever.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.839
I loved bumping into her again
at the stadium.

11:54.719 --> 11:57.040
- This boy is so handsome.
- A little--

11:57.120 --> 11:59.320
I have two girlfriends for you.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.680
- Two.
- Of course.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.959
- Eva and Alana.
- At the same time.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.360
He does like this…

12:05.680 --> 12:08.520
Well, I told her
we'll set up a playdate with the kids,

12:08.600 --> 12:10.360
because she has a beautiful son…

12:10.440 --> 12:12.520
He has Alana's hair.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.240
And I know
my kids and him will get along.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.520
Let's go, come on.

12:22.719 --> 12:24.440
- Hi!
- Good evening.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.640
Thank you.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.600
Well, I have to say that seeing myself
in the dress and the videos,

12:32.680 --> 12:34.240
I look like a…

12:35.000 --> 12:36.520
A what? Just perfect?

12:36.599 --> 12:38.680
- A queen.
- You've seen what?

12:38.760 --> 12:41.520
- Oh!
- Hey, man!

12:42.839 --> 12:46.800
Cris always takes cares of me.
He compliments me all the time.

13:02.880 --> 13:03.880
And Gio asks me,

13:03.959 --> 13:06.520
"If I make him a heart sign,
would that be cheesy?"

13:06.599 --> 13:08.839
- And I was like…

13:09.680 --> 13:11.920
I wanted to make him a heart
during the anthem,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.640
because he waved to me.

13:13.719 --> 13:15.760
I was going to make the heart,
and I asked her,

13:15.839 --> 13:18.320
"Should I do it or is it a little cheesy?"

13:18.400 --> 13:20.760
And she says,
"It'll be cheesy, but do it."

13:20.839 --> 13:22.520
And I was like, "Okay."

13:22.599 --> 13:26.360
I was thinking how proud I am of Cris
before going to sleep.

13:26.959 --> 13:29.599
Aw…

13:31.360 --> 13:32.480
Get married.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.800
TURIN, ITALY

14:00.680 --> 14:04.079
Careful, careful.
If you shake it too hard, it will pop out.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.000
Hmm?

14:06.320 --> 14:08.079
Oh, what are they putting on Nikki?

14:09.560 --> 14:11.280
Alana, don't!

14:12.199 --> 14:14.440
When they're not in school,
I try to get a tutor

14:14.520 --> 14:17.079
to come in the mornings
to stimulate the kids,

14:17.160 --> 14:19.400
so I have some time to work out.

14:20.040 --> 14:23.280
A private tutor comes around
to help Júnior with his homework.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.640
Hang on.
Look, Alana, this one goes over here.

14:26.719 --> 14:29.280
And Mateo, can you pour it in here?

14:30.680 --> 14:33.640
Good. Pouring. Good!

14:33.719 --> 14:35.240
Well done.

14:35.839 --> 14:39.319
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Good morning.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.839
How are you this morning?

14:40.920 --> 14:43.760
- This is for Mommy.
- My kids are wonderful.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.160
Cris is like the eldest son of my dreams.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.439
The best companion I could ask for.

14:49.560 --> 14:50.839
My loves!

14:51.560 --> 14:54.240
- Take this! It's for you.
- Wow.

14:54.839 --> 14:57.880
My love! That's so pretty.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.160
- What do you have there? Let's see.
- No.

15:04.199 --> 15:08.079
Eva is more shy,
a lot more sensitive, and a mommy's girl.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.839
Mommy, I… I have something.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.680
I made myself a necklace to put with this.

15:15.199 --> 15:17.400
Mateo is very affectionate.

15:17.479 --> 15:19.439
He is great at sports.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.079
He's very sensitive and a good boy.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.959
He's such a good boy.

15:25.439 --> 15:29.319
- Look, the triangle.
- That's a perfect triangle. Show Mommy.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.319
- Show your perfect triangle.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.760
I made it.

15:32.839 --> 15:34.560
It's so pretty, Mateo.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.319
Mommy, you have…

15:36.400 --> 15:37.439
- It's a house!
- Yes!

15:37.520 --> 15:39.640
- But you have to share with Mom, Alana.
- No!

15:39.719 --> 15:42.880
No, be… because you don't let me--

15:42.959 --> 15:44.240
Your stuff that…

15:44.319 --> 15:47.400
- Yes, yes, you don't--
- That's a lie.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.719
Cris, doesn't Mommy share everything
with Alana?

15:50.800 --> 15:51.719
Yes.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.640
- No!
- Can I have some fruit?

15:54.719 --> 15:58.319
- Because you're bad. Really bad!
- Alana!

15:58.959 --> 16:00.719
Alana is very cheerful.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.479
She loves to stand out.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.640
She's very talkative.

16:03.719 --> 16:05.760
She was the first one
of the three to talk.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.040
And she's happy-go-lucky.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.839
She's a daddy's girl.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.199
She doesn't allow me to go near her dad.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.920
She won't let me give her dad a kiss.
She does everything with him.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.000
Let's say a proper goodbye to Nikki
and thank her.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.800
Say, "Thank you, Nikki, for everything."

16:22.439 --> 16:25.959
It sounds bad to say this,
but they are the perfect kids.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.599
I mean, they're dream kids.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.280
Let's say goodbye to Nikki

16:29.359 --> 16:31.839
because we're going on vacation
and won't see her.

16:32.439 --> 16:34.240
All summer.

16:34.319 --> 16:37.120
Since they were very little,
I'd inspire them.

16:37.959 --> 16:39.760
Let's ride the pony, kids!

16:39.839 --> 16:42.280
- Who dares to do it?
- Yes! Me!

16:42.359 --> 16:44.640
The only one
who hasn't ridden the pony is Cris.

16:44.719 --> 16:47.400
Yes, 'cause the pony will fall down.

16:49.560 --> 16:53.520
I want to instill in my kids
the same thing my mom instilled in me.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.680
Being in the countryside,
where they can find peace.

16:58.439 --> 16:59.640
I want them to connect,

17:00.319 --> 17:03.719
it's good for them to touch the dirt,
to touch the trees,

17:04.399 --> 17:08.560
to not always be stuck among buildings,
trips, cars, planes.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.119
Anyone can have that luxury.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.839
It's nature and it needs
to be looked after.

17:13.919 --> 17:15.720
We must know how to enjoy it.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.000
Hold on tight.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.560
Great, now let's get Eva on now.

17:19.640 --> 17:22.399
Mateo with the small one. The small pony.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.040
- Hold on here.
- No!

17:25.119 --> 17:26.560
You're coming with me.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.839
- Mateo!
- No!

17:27.919 --> 17:29.399
-  No!
- Love.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.880
No! No!

17:30.960 --> 17:35.640
Eva and Alana are super brave,
go-getters. Ready for the action.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.240
Mateo might be a bit fearful.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.000
I couldn't get him on the horse
until Mateo was one year old.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.600
- Touch its head.
- Hold on to the saddle tight.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.480
It's hair like Alana's.

17:46.560 --> 17:50.399
Almost curly, but not quite.
It's named Mateo, like you.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.159
Okay, let's go? Hold tight, Alana.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.040
- Firm grip. Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.520
Easy.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.800
Is it a male? Or… It's Lina and…

18:01.880 --> 18:03.159
- Yole.
- What's its name?

18:03.240 --> 18:04.960
Oh, two females.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.800
- Mateo.
- Mateo will ride eventually.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.720
He says he wants to go on Eva's.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.399
- Why don't we swap?
- Should we?

18:12.480 --> 18:14.120
- Okay, hold on.
- Okay.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.200
Go on.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.960
Let me see, Mateo.

18:19.159 --> 18:20.120
Let me.

18:26.159 --> 18:27.320
It has a lot of hair.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.880
Mateo and I said
that one has a lot of hair like you.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.159
You have a lot of hair.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.960
It's like me.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.520
Okay, let's go.
Alana, hold on to the saddle, love.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.840
I haven't gotten over my fear
of horseback riding.

18:42.919 --> 18:46.360
When the kids are on the pony,
a girl walks alongside them on their left,

18:46.440 --> 18:47.840
and I walk on their right.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.960
And the girls, who are fed up,
tell me, "Leave us."

18:51.040 --> 18:52.320
I don't want to.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.120
I want to be next to them.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.000
I have a lot of respect for horses,
because at the end, they are just animals.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.200
I've fallen from a horse.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.399
A horse bit me.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.960
And I can't leave my kids alone, for now.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.360
- And here, a horse bit my nail.
- Oh, no.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.159
I noticed--

19:08.240 --> 19:11.399
I didn't want to look at my finger.
It was bleeding.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.200
- Did it have blood?
- At least it was a gel nail.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.120
Yes.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.919
It was scary but it's perfect now.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.720
How's life like up there, Cris?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.360
Great. You can see all of Turin.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.280
- It's really high, isn't it?
- Yes.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.360
- Cris, tell her to trot a little bit.
- Yes? You are a gentleman.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.480
You just have to hold tight
with your legs.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.159
Come, Eva.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.880
He's going slow. I don't know.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.159
- Well done, Cris.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.679
I wish my kids lots of good health.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.040
That's something I always ask of God.

19:49.159 --> 19:52.480
The horse is calm.
Okay, okay, don't worry.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.000
- Perfect.
- Come on, trot.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.840
I wish them lots of happiness,
to fight,

20:01.919 --> 20:04.960
to be happy and, above all,
to be good people.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.480
Well now, what's left?

20:18.080 --> 20:20.120
We are going to see Eugenia.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.040
- You met her in San Remo, right?
- Yes, I did.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.600
My friend Julia and I are going to Milan
to meet with my friend, Eugenia.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.760
She's a jewelry designer.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.600
Is she going to give you
the Venice jewels?

20:33.679 --> 20:37.120
- Has she lent them to you?
- She'll show them to me. I'll wear them.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.960
As soon as we arrive,
go to Monte Napoleone

20:40.040 --> 20:41.800
and pick up something I ordered.

20:41.880 --> 20:42.760
Okay.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.640
I'll go to meet Eugenia, we'll chat a bit,
and then I'll pick you up.

20:47.720 --> 20:51.320
Julia's really fun.
She makes everything easier.

20:51.399 --> 20:55.240
She helps me to unplug from work,
she makes work feel like leisure.

20:55.919 --> 20:58.360
She makes it entertaining and happy.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.120
How do I know if I've won the lottery?

21:02.200 --> 21:05.200
Well, if you check your bank account
and see it has a one million euro--

21:05.280 --> 21:07.200
No, but here, look.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.000
I've played the lottery, the EuroMillions,

21:10.080 --> 21:11.480
everything I see on the screen.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.480
And also, I share it with my friends,

21:13.560 --> 21:17.320
the ones that have an account on the app,
and they always share tickets with me.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.760
Elena tells me, "When you share,
we always win something."

21:20.840 --> 21:23.880
True. And are you happy
when you get a few cents?

21:24.760 --> 21:27.600
I think someday I'll win. I have a hunch.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.080
MILAN, ITALY

21:40.960 --> 21:43.560
- Good morning, love.
- Good morning, love.

21:44.399 --> 21:46.679
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

21:47.600 --> 21:48.520
Very good.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.399
- You look very pretty.
- Good to see you again.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.120
Do you like what I'm wearing?

21:55.200 --> 21:57.000
- I like it more.
- It's your creation.

21:58.120 --> 22:02.840
I met Eugenia when I arrived in Turin,
when Cristiano started with Juventus.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.800
That summer, I was invited
to the Venice Film Festival.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.320
A few brands contacted me and Ramón.

22:10.399 --> 22:13.640
And I connected a lot
with Eugenia's jewelry.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.640
I really identified with her designs.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.159
Isn't it beautiful here?

22:19.240 --> 22:20.560
It's beautiful.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.560
The other time I was here,
it was very dark.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.520
It's a beautiful place to do a tango here.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.200
- Outdoors.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.960
The lady of the tangos.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.439
The lady of the tangos.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.360
And one day, I was shopping in Milan,

22:37.439 --> 22:41.640
and I told her, "Eugenia,
I'm in Milan and I'd love to see you."

22:41.720 --> 22:44.520
And well, we were eating,
and during that meal she tells me,

22:44.600 --> 22:47.880
"Gio, I've imagined you dancing a tango
in San Remo."

22:48.520 --> 22:51.679
And then you dreamt I was dancing tango
with your jewels, right?

22:52.840 --> 22:55.560
San Remo is so beautiful with the music.

22:55.640 --> 23:00.399
It would be really nice
if they did a tango show in San Remo.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.919
With dancing? That would be gorgeous.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.960
Or any dance really…
…since you're not a tango dancer.

23:08.040 --> 23:11.360
When you told me,
I said, "I don't dance tango."

23:11.439 --> 23:15.399
I was like, "How am I going to tango
if I'm a classical ballerina?"

23:15.480 --> 23:17.040
"I don't dance tango."

23:17.120 --> 23:18.840
"Gio, it's fine. Think about it."

23:18.919 --> 23:22.360
I knew San Remo was one of
the most important festivals in the world.

23:22.439 --> 23:26.120
I said, "How am I going to dance
in San Remo?" "I barely speak Italian."

23:26.200 --> 23:29.399
I had already said,
"Yes, yes, she dances the tango,"

23:29.480 --> 23:31.640
because I was convinced
that you danced tango.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.800
Then I said,
"No, she can't dance it."

23:33.880 --> 23:35.640
- Yes.
- You were great at learning.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.040
Tango, at the end,
you have to feel the dance.

23:38.679 --> 23:40.840
At the end, her dream came true.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.320
At the beginning,
I didn't think I could do it,

23:43.399 --> 23:46.520
but with passion, drive and zeal,
everything is possible.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.040
I made such an impact on the world.

24:18.720 --> 24:22.760
It's an unforgettable experience
and I'll be forever grateful.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.600
- Mm.
- One more time.

24:26.679 --> 24:28.640
- Yes, one more.
- It's beautiful.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.040
Mm!

24:34.360 --> 24:36.439
These jewels are like a dream.

24:37.560 --> 24:41.120
I love emeralds, sapphires, rubies.
I love diamonds.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.880
What's cheaper? Rubies or diamonds?

24:45.080 --> 24:48.919
No, when you get to this carat,
it's a diamond.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.240
More expensive?

24:51.560 --> 24:53.480
Sometimes it depends on…

24:53.560 --> 24:56.679
- But, yes, the diamond is more expensive.
- It's more expensive?

24:59.439 --> 25:01.320
That one is in yellow, in yellow?

25:01.399 --> 25:04.960
Hmm, yes, I did this
in three different types of gold.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.919
Because now this color is trendy.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.560
There is in this yellow color.
Then I also did the white.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.080
- Because I did all the colors.
- And it goes with this.

25:12.159 --> 25:13.399
- Too.
- Right?

25:13.480 --> 25:14.320
It does.

25:15.600 --> 25:16.880
The first jewels I got

25:16.960 --> 25:20.480
were heart-shaped diamond earrings
with a matching heart-shaped necklace,

25:20.560 --> 25:22.360
that Cris got me for Christmas.

25:25.280 --> 25:28.040
It's gorgeous.
It comes right out of the…

25:30.560 --> 25:31.800
It's beautiful.

25:32.399 --> 25:34.679
- It's so bright.
- This one? Yes.

25:38.199 --> 25:41.199
When Eugenia shows me her jewelry,
I go crazy.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.840
I'm like a little girl
in a toy store.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.880
I'm sure Arab countries
love this collection, right?

25:47.960 --> 25:49.280
- Yes.
- This collection.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.159
Beautiful. Wonderful.

25:59.679 --> 26:02.320
I can't hold back the urge
to try everything on.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.120
And for example if we go to Venice,
could I wear this collection?

26:06.199 --> 26:07.760
Yes, it's beautiful.

26:07.840 --> 26:11.520
Years ago, I loved window-shopping
on the Gold Mile.

26:12.320 --> 26:16.000
And I'd dream of wearing
all those jewels and those creations.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.679
Again, dreams come true.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.320
Shall we look in Cavalli
for some Cannes options?

26:33.399 --> 26:34.960
- Yes.
- For the super festival.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.080
I'll also get something for Cris
while I'm at it.

26:37.159 --> 26:39.439
Great. He'll love it. That's so sweet.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.960
We're going to Cavalli,
one of my favorite designers.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.360
I'm still looking for my dress for Cannes.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.520
- For the Cannes Festival.
- One for Cannes.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.080
This is one of them.

26:56.159 --> 26:58.120
And the other one,
it's in the dressing room.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.520
- For the back, this one is gorgeous.
- It's already there.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.840
- Oh, that's the dress.
- Exactly.

27:02.919 --> 27:05.240
This is the dress with the shoes.

27:08.520 --> 27:11.080
I only have one leg in
and it's already tight.

27:11.159 --> 27:15.600
Well, you can go
with one leg in and the other one out.

27:15.679 --> 27:18.520
- Done! Tuck your butt.
- No! No.

27:19.199 --> 27:23.040
You can have that wonderful butt
after so much training?

27:23.120 --> 27:26.080
- This won't fit.
- Of course.

27:26.159 --> 27:28.679
Because I can tuck my butt.
It's a tiny one.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.120
I just have a little fat.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.120
We chose some dresses
I loved from pictures.

27:33.199 --> 27:36.040
Unfortunately one of them
didn't get over my knees.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.760
We requested the other dress.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.840
- The other one?
- She's getting it.

27:39.919 --> 27:41.520
- Look at the material.
- Got it, great.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.360
- This one looks really weird, right?
- Too much, yes.

27:45.439 --> 27:47.360
- Too tight.
- Too tight.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.159
One second. Just a second.

27:51.399 --> 27:53.679
It doesn't fit.
Not even in the wrist.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.360
- Here you go.
- Very good. Thank you.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.640
Let me ask.
Could I have one size down?

28:01.720 --> 28:03.040
That could be possible.

28:03.120 --> 28:06.159
I really wanted to touch the textures,
the fabrics,

28:06.240 --> 28:07.800
try on everything.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.960
You want the seamstress
to take measurements,

28:12.040 --> 28:13.760
and we'll call for your Cannes event?

28:13.840 --> 28:15.120
It's up to you.

28:15.199 --> 28:18.880
The thing is, years have passed…
…and the years are adding up.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.199
Oh, time.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.800
- I know a lot about that--
- Years and food.

28:25.240 --> 28:27.240
No. I mean, you're beautiful.

28:27.320 --> 28:32.000
It just happened that these are
unique pieces and they were really small.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.439
Look, so he can match my outfit.
So we're twinning.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.640
- These are pretty. It'd be funny.
- It's cool.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.120
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, it's cool.

28:45.679 --> 28:46.720
Perfect.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.240
So, I bought the shirt
for Cristiano, and the dress for me,

28:50.320 --> 28:51.679
so we have matching outfits.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.280
- He wears short ones.
- Briefs? Slip?

28:55.080 --> 28:57.080
They'd have to be boxers, like these.

28:57.159 --> 28:59.639
- Otherwise, it'd have to be--
- I don't see that one.

29:00.240 --> 29:04.000
When she tells me,
"Let's go to a store just to look around."

29:04.080 --> 29:08.879
We end up with-- well,
<i>she</i> ends up with 350,000 bags.

29:09.959 --> 29:12.679
This is nice. I also like this one.

29:13.959 --> 29:16.879
This is a design
that's very popular now.

29:16.959 --> 29:19.959
- What about this one? I love it.
- To be at home, chilling…

29:20.040 --> 29:22.720
So, it's fun, because at the end,
you look around and say,

29:22.800 --> 29:25.679
"I like that."
"Oh, and that one for so-and-so."

29:26.679 --> 29:28.800
The seamstress is telling me
that this one,

29:28.879 --> 29:30.959
the original one…

29:32.720 --> 29:36.199
- It will be too exposed--
- This is going to be too… You know.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.399
A model's butt is not the same as mine.

29:38.959 --> 29:41.120
You know what happened? In Venice…

29:41.199 --> 29:42.879
- when I was younger--
- They did it for you.

29:42.959 --> 29:44.879
I was 22 or 23 years old.

29:44.959 --> 29:49.439
I said, "Yes, put me in a bodysuit,"
that showed my butt through black lace.

29:50.040 --> 29:54.720
Afterwards, I saw the pictures and I said,
"That's crude. I don't like it."

29:54.800 --> 29:57.080
"I can't go to a red carpet
showing my butt."

29:57.159 --> 29:58.159
Sure.

30:02.199 --> 30:05.040
- Wow, this one is so sexy,
- It is divine.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.120
But it is too open.

30:06.199 --> 30:08.360
- I like this skirt.
- Yes.

30:08.439 --> 30:10.639
I told the guy to get a shirt for…

30:10.720 --> 30:12.439
- This one.
- Perfect. Which one?

30:12.520 --> 30:14.040
With the print, right?

30:14.800 --> 30:16.520
I don't buy a lot of clothes.

30:17.159 --> 30:19.840
I buy a few pieces,
but they're good quality.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.600
Georgina, here's everything.

30:23.439 --> 30:25.720
Here you have the two swimsuits,
plus the perfume.

30:26.399 --> 30:27.919
Here is the shirt and the skirt.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.959
Ennio has told me this is all on us.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.600
- Yes.

30:33.439 --> 30:34.320
That's right.

30:34.879 --> 30:36.439
- Yes?
- That's right.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.080
- Yes, yes.
- Oh, thank you.

30:38.159 --> 30:41.760
- So this time, as I said, is on us.
- Goodness, thanks.

30:42.959 --> 30:45.879
I didn't know. Otherwise,
I wouldn't have gotten so much stuff.

30:45.959 --> 30:47.760
Goodness, this is embarrassing.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.199
- Thank you so much--
- It's a pleasure.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.639
I love everything.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.679
When I was about to pay,

30:54.760 --> 30:56.240
they told me it was on them.

30:57.199 --> 30:58.560
I couldn't believe it.

30:59.280 --> 31:02.480
And even when we have everything,
every little gift,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.120
any kind gesture is nice, isn't it?

31:05.679 --> 31:06.879
We love it.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.959
MADRID, SPAIN

31:24.800 --> 31:25.679
Good morning.

31:26.720 --> 31:30.240
Through the agency,
Ramón contacts the brands

31:30.320 --> 31:33.439
and the brands contact him
for me to be the star in their campaigns,

31:33.520 --> 31:34.760
and events…

31:35.919 --> 31:37.240
Did you buy oat milk?

31:37.320 --> 31:39.240
Yes, I've bought
every kind of milk.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.320
Oat, soy, and others
in case you change your mind.

31:41.399 --> 31:45.040
- Good, good, good. Amazing, Ramón.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.560
I'm getting chunky, uh?

31:50.639 --> 31:52.760
At least, it's not
a swimsuit photo shoot.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.520
- Damn!

32:00.480 --> 32:03.280
- This morning, "Mom, where are you going?"
- Poor little ones.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.080
Oh, and they run. Poor little ones.

32:05.159 --> 32:07.399
I'm a mom, mm…

32:08.240 --> 32:09.879
A very active mom.

32:10.439 --> 32:13.760
The whole day I'm with them,
so all the time they're saying,

32:13.840 --> 32:14.919
"Mom! Mom! Mom!"

32:16.600 --> 32:18.320
- They're missing you.
- Of course.

32:18.399 --> 32:21.000
They know that when Mom is home,
it's a party.

32:22.360 --> 32:25.679
When I set my mind to something,
I try to give it my all,

32:25.760 --> 32:26.800
for it to turn out well.

32:35.159 --> 32:36.560
I think I am a trendsetter.

32:36.639 --> 32:41.080
Often, colleagues of mine
who work in stores, or in fashion say,

32:41.159 --> 32:44.080
"Hey, Gio, you put this on Instagram,

32:44.159 --> 32:47.399
or you were in a magazine
with that bag, and it sold out."

32:48.320 --> 32:52.480
Or with dresses, sneakers,
shoes, jewelry… Yes.

33:00.639 --> 33:01.520
Welcome.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.639
Thank you.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.360
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hello.

33:12.439 --> 33:15.000
- How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.439
Some flowers for you.

33:17.719 --> 33:19.840
I'm happy to see you again…

33:19.919 --> 33:21.560
- I'm happier to see you.
- …in Madrid.

33:21.639 --> 33:23.120
Thank you very much for having me.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.919
I met Ali Karoui
for the first time in Cannes

33:27.000 --> 33:28.719
for the 2018 festival.

33:28.800 --> 33:29.800
I loved him.

33:30.320 --> 33:34.639
Since then, well, I've worn his dress
for Cristiano's award ceremony in Dubai.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.800
WHAT A DAY.

33:36.879 --> 33:39.760
CONGRATULATIONS MY LOVE
FOR THIS WELL-DESERVED AWARD.

33:40.919 --> 33:43.480
The thing is, this… mm…

33:44.280 --> 33:45.120
Yes.

33:45.199 --> 33:46.560
You are gorgeous as usual.

33:46.639 --> 33:47.480
She is.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.879
- I don't think so.
- You slay all the looks, don't worry.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.560
His designs work really well
for all body types.

33:53.639 --> 33:56.240
Very skinny, less skinny, chubbier…

33:56.320 --> 33:57.959
And they're suggestive.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.639
- Sofi.
- What's up?

33:59.719 --> 34:01.199
Let's bring the team together.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.760
- Nice seeing you.
- Me too.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.879
- After so many times.
- Yes.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.719
- I think a little corset, you know?
- Yes.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.759
Inside, yes, it could be nice.

34:12.839 --> 34:14.159
Like this, maybe.

34:14.239 --> 34:17.159
One corset like this.
We can do the skirt like this.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.400
- But without this.
- Yes.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.520
It's important
for the designer to know you

34:23.600 --> 34:26.159
so when you have to choose a dress,
you save time

34:26.239 --> 34:28.400
and get straight down to business.

34:30.280 --> 34:33.960
…but longer because… You remember.

34:34.040 --> 34:36.679
- The first problem.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.639
- Yes.
- Yes, it's like-- All this is…

34:40.719 --> 34:43.600
And all this, like… Everything.

34:43.679 --> 34:45.319
Like this. Like this.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.600
- Yes.
- So the corset's gonna be like this.

34:51.560 --> 34:55.360
It's insane. It's insane to see her
wear my dresses every time.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.080
She slays all the looks.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.880
She's just, uh…

34:59.520 --> 35:03.760
one of the women who…
who slays the red carpet every time.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.120
- Yes, and with the open back.
- Open.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.640
Open back.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.319
It's not super open.
It's like a high waist.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.720
- Like this.
- No, all open.

35:13.799 --> 35:15.080
- Don't worry.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.000
I like!

35:16.880 --> 35:19.560
He knows me. He knows what I like.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.160
He doesn't try to change me
and he makes me feel confident.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.120
The green one?

35:23.200 --> 35:26.040
The thing is,
he has designed a green dress…

35:26.960 --> 35:27.920
Like this…

35:29.319 --> 35:30.160
Very similar.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.480
And it was worn
by a Victoria's Secret angel.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:35.440 --> 35:38.680
It was very similar,
this color and this model to this dress.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.400
- Okay.
- We can change. Don't worry.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.080
That's why I want to wear something…

35:43.120 --> 35:45.839
On the red carpet,
you don't wear everyday clothes,

35:45.920 --> 35:48.400
but it doesn't need to be costumey either.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.839
- We are decided.
- I like it.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.480
I think so, right?

35:52.560 --> 35:53.799
Or green.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.280
- Green, yes.
- Green?

35:57.360 --> 35:58.600
- Now she wants--
- This one.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.480
Let's do gold and green

36:00.560 --> 36:03.440
because she might swap to gold
in five minutes.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.120
No, no, I think green.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.839
- Sure?
- Yes.

36:07.920 --> 36:08.960
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.319
- Make it sparkly.

36:11.400 --> 36:15.600

our vacations are kicking off in Majorca.

37:27.799 --> 37:30.839
During vacation, we try to do
what I can't do during the season.

Doing whatever I want to.
