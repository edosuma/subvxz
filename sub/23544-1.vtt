00:24.792 --> 00:29.073
What I wanted to do first
is to give you an image

00:29.097 --> 00:32.633
of what drives me
forward in fusion.

01:32.693 --> 01:36.306
Imagine you're reaching up
and you're grabbing the sun,

01:36.330 --> 01:39.309
something of the order of a
100 million degrees Celsius,

01:39.333 --> 01:41.469
and you want to put
the sun in a bottle.

01:48.642 --> 01:52.822
And we have ways of doing that.
We create a magnetic model.

01:52.846 --> 01:56.193
Compared to anything that mankind
has ever done in the past,

01:56.217 --> 01:59.929
be it walking on the moon,
be it decoding DNA,

01:59.953 --> 02:01.522
this is a great challenge.

02:03.391 --> 02:06.470
We, as humans, we're lazy.

02:06.494 --> 02:09.306
In the sense that if we
have a choice of going

02:09.330 --> 02:11.808
a very easy path or
very complicated path,

02:11.832 --> 02:13.343
we would always
go the easy path.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.911
And that's what we're
doing with energy.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.181
We're burning fossil fuels,

02:17.205 --> 02:19.516
coal, natural gas, crude oil,

02:19.540 --> 02:21.642
and that is changing
the environment.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.332
We're similar to, I hate
to say it, to yeast,

02:35.356 --> 02:37.534
where the yeast basically
multiply, multiply, multiply,

02:37.558 --> 02:40.537
eat up all of the
flour and the dough

02:40.561 --> 02:43.840
until basically they die off
from their own excrement,

02:43.864 --> 02:45.942
uh, because they've just eaten
up all their resources,

02:45.966 --> 02:48.602
and they've died from their own
pollution that they've created.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.597
We have to find a clean source

03:07.621 --> 03:09.799
that's going to be
available for lifetimes,

03:09.823 --> 03:12.436
and that's what fusion is.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.004
I really feel that if we don't
crack fusion, we are doomed,

03:15.028 --> 03:16.597
to be honest.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.763
What we're trying to
do here is to make

04:46.787 --> 04:48.565
a artificial star.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.067
Stars have some things
we don't have on Earth,

04:51.091 --> 04:52.793
size and mass.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.341
The Sun, for example, is a
very nice fusion reactor

04:57.365 --> 04:59.509
that enjoys considerable
public support,

04:59.533 --> 05:01.611
and it works on the
basis of gravity

05:01.635 --> 05:04.948
plus its magnetic field,
uh, to confine the plasma.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.617
Now, the sun is really big,

05:07.641 --> 05:10.019
800,000 miles, something
like, across.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.789
Uh, we clearly don't
want anything that big,

05:12.813 --> 05:15.616
so we have to rely on the
magnetic fields alone.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.964
That turns out to be doable,

05:20.988 --> 05:23.800
but technologically difficult
to do on a large scale.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.769
And so we've been
learning how to do this

05:25.793 --> 05:27.595
for about 40 or 50 years.

05:33.601 --> 05:37.080
What's amazing about work in
that era is we didn't know

05:37.104 --> 05:40.884
what the energy process
that drove stars was.

05:53.487 --> 05:56.132
Hans Bethe, the
nuclear physicist,

05:56.156 --> 05:57.734
uh, was at a seminar,

05:57.758 --> 06:00.504
and the next day he
was gonna give a talk

06:00.528 --> 06:03.807
where he talked about a fusion
fuel cycle for the stars.

06:03.831 --> 06:07.911
But he had a date that night, and
so they went out for a walk.

06:07.935 --> 06:11.515
And he came out with what has
to be the best line ever,

06:11.539 --> 06:13.883
which is, "Aren't the
starts beautiful tonight?

06:13.907 --> 06:16.844
And right now, I'm the only guy
in the world who knows why."

06:19.079 --> 06:20.156
In the sun's core,

06:20.180 --> 06:24.428
when these particles are
accelerated to high speeds

06:24.452 --> 06:25.729
and collide...

06:25.753 --> 06:27.421
they fuse.

06:33.661 --> 06:36.573
Fusion fuel is in,
essentially, infinite supply

06:36.597 --> 06:39.533
and is available to all
countries at negligible cost.

06:40.801 --> 06:45.815
The fuel, or fusion...
is in common water.

06:45.839 --> 06:49.553
Fusion will produce no noxious
chemical combustion products,

06:49.577 --> 06:53.523
and there will be absolutely no
chance of a runaway reaction.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.559
And fusion will not
involve materials

06:55.583 --> 06:58.662
that could be stolen or used
for clandestine purposes.

06:58.686 --> 07:01.731
When I came into this project
almost 20 years ago,

07:01.755 --> 07:04.534
there was a tremendous
amount of enthusiasm.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.894
Everyone was confident
of success.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.075
In the Zeta apparatus,

07:12.099 --> 07:14.177
we have produced temperatures

07:14.201 --> 07:16.045
which are about
one-third of those

07:16.069 --> 07:18.047
at the center of the sun.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.583
But this enthusiasm

07:19.607 --> 07:22.018
was a kind of
ignorant enthusiasm.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.054
As fusion researchers have
painfully discovered,

07:25.078 --> 07:26.723
it's just not that simple.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.592
After this initial enthusiasm,

07:28.616 --> 07:31.728
then came a decade of
caution and skepticism.

07:31.752 --> 07:35.231
And now, after 20 years,
we're back to enthusiasm.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.601
In the early 1980s,
we expect to create

07:37.625 --> 07:38.802
many thermal megawatts

07:38.826 --> 07:40.861
of fusion energy for
the first time.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.922
So the whole planet
needs a lot of energy.

07:58.946 --> 08:02.892
And so far, we've been running
mostly on fossil fuels.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.927
Been a good run.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.720
It got us to where we
are, but we have to stop.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.233
So we are trying different
types of energy now,

08:10.257 --> 08:11.267
alternative energy.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.003
But it proved quite
difficult to find something

08:14.027 --> 08:17.006
that's as convenient
and as cost-effective

08:17.030 --> 08:20.076
as oil, gas, and coal.

08:20.100 --> 08:24.581
Now, we know of two way of
making, er, nuclear energy:

08:24.605 --> 08:26.916
Fission and fusion.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.985
Now, in fission, you
take a big nucleus,

08:29.009 --> 08:32.020
you break it in part, in two,
and it makes lots of energy.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.924
This is how the nuclear
reactor today works.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.225
Works pretty good.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.927
And then there is fusion.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.730
Now, I like fusion.
Fusion's much better.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.600
So you take two small
nucleus, you put it together,

08:43.624 --> 08:44.834
and you make helium.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.170
And that's very nice.
Makes lots of energy.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.807
And if the whole planet would
run on fusion, it would run...

08:50.831 --> 08:52.576
We could extract the
fuel from the ocean,

08:52.600 --> 08:55.745
it would run for billions
and billions of years.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.182
Now, if fusion is so great,
why don't we have it.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.717
Where is it?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.318
Well, there's always
a bit of a catch.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.054
Fusion is really,
really hard to do.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.925
Physics-wise, fusion is
the, the fusion, ha-ha,

09:08.949 --> 09:09.726
of two nucleus.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.195
Usually, you use a
hydrogen nucleus

09:12.219 --> 09:13.797
or isotope of hydrogen.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.265
And when they touch each
other, they fuse together,

09:16.289 --> 09:17.500
and they make helium

09:17.524 --> 09:20.604
and release a lot of energy in
the form of a fast neutron.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.339
So this is the, the nuclear
reaction in the center.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.473
Now the problem is
those two nucleus,

09:24.497 --> 09:26.810
they're electrically charged,
they're both positive,

09:26.834 --> 09:28.311
so they don't want
to stick together.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.013
They go like this, whoo, shoo,

09:30.037 --> 09:31.280
and they never fuse.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.717
So in order to fuse, you have
to throw them at great speed.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.952
And speed in a gas
is the temperature.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.387
So you have to heat the gas
so the thermal agitation

09:38.411 --> 09:41.691
is fast enough so the nucleus
can touch each other.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.027
And that temperature is a
150 million degrees C.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.796
That's pretty hot. And this
is how the stars work.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.164
The-The stars are very hot

09:48.188 --> 09:51.067
and inside the star, there
is this fusion reaction.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.803
So on the Earth here,
we need to heat the gas

09:53.827 --> 09:55.304
to 150 million degrees C.

09:55.328 --> 09:59.108
And the other problem is a gas
that hot wants to cool down.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.744
So it cools down really quickly.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.379
So you put some energy
in there to heat it up,

10:03.403 --> 10:04.447
and then the heat escape.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.850
And when it's hot enough,
it makes some reaction,

10:06.874 --> 10:08.918
it makes some fusion,
it makes some energy.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.687
So the name of the
game is to try to get

10:10.711 --> 10:12.112
more energy out than you put in.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.788
The world's most
ambitious attempt

11:18.812 --> 11:21.090
to harvest fusion as
a source of power

11:21.114 --> 11:22.826
is taking shape in France.

11:22.850 --> 11:26.262
The project is costing
13 billion pounds

11:26.286 --> 11:29.198
and it's being backed by a
whole swathe of countries

11:29.222 --> 11:30.958
around the world.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.457
ITER's going to be built
from about a million pieces,

11:54.481 --> 11:55.892
so it's a real nightmare

11:55.916 --> 11:57.927
to know where pieces are
and don't lose them,

11:57.951 --> 11:59.495
know which piece goes where,

11:59.519 --> 12:01.721
wh-what is this piece
that I'm looking at.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.834
We build the tokamak
from the bottom up,

12:04.858 --> 12:06.469
so you can only build
it in a certain way.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.837
So if a certain
piece is missing,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.238
we'll have to wait for it.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.540
So it's key... At the
moment, what we're doing

12:11.564 --> 12:14.243
is a very large planning
effort with all the members

12:14.267 --> 12:17.046
to make sure that each
piece is delivered to us

12:17.070 --> 12:18.581
in good time and
at the right time.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.550
The parties all want to
learn all the technologies,

12:21.574 --> 12:24.387
which means you not giving
one component to a party,

12:24.411 --> 12:26.990
you're giving a piece of a
component, and the other party

12:27.014 --> 12:28.858
wants another piece
of the same component

12:28.882 --> 12:30.526
so that they all can
learn the technology.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.996
It is luckily not so that
we have seven pieces

12:33.020 --> 12:35.564
- of each component that it
will be too difficult...

12:35.588 --> 12:37.433
but we have sometimes
three or four pieces

12:37.457 --> 12:38.902
of each component,
and that means...

12:38.926 --> 12:41.337
We have to talk to our
partners, to the members,

12:41.361 --> 12:42.471
in all the... as you say,

12:42.495 --> 12:43.973
in all these countries
around the world,

12:43.997 --> 12:47.410
in Korea, in Japan, in
Russia, China, US, India.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.579
You have not one
guy to deal with.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.415
You have three or four
guys to deal with

12:52.439 --> 12:53.883
for the same component.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.919
We are pushing the
edge of technology

12:55.943 --> 12:58.888
and therefore, sometimes
we run into problems

12:58.912 --> 13:00.890
and we have to solve
these problems.

13:00.914 --> 13:04.928
Critics point out that the costs
have trebled in five years.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.163
They say the whole
project is a gamble

13:07.187 --> 13:08.397
that won't pay off.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.835
Will we be able, with
our complex structure,

13:11.859 --> 13:14.503
and the money we
have, to be in time?

13:14.527 --> 13:18.207
This is actually the most, uh,
difficult thing at the moment,

13:18.231 --> 13:19.366
to stay in time.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.545
What's slowly taking shape here

13:22.569 --> 13:24.247
in the southern
French countryside

13:24.271 --> 13:28.117
could provide the answer to
the world's energy crisis,

13:28.141 --> 13:31.220
or it might prove one of the
most expensive failures

13:31.244 --> 13:33.013
in scientific history.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.165
So I'm gonna try to
go through quickly.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.333
I wanna give you an idea
of the realistic schedule.

13:44.357 --> 13:48.037
I received an email this morning
of a new first plasma date,

13:48.061 --> 13:50.006
which is different from
the first plasma date

13:50.030 --> 13:51.941
that you will see, uh,

13:51.965 --> 13:54.010
or which was the first plasma
date of about two weeks ago,

13:54.034 --> 13:55.244
which is different
from what you'll see.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.347
So there's three iterations
behind the first plasma date.

13:58.371 --> 14:03.186
When ITER organization
came about in 2006,

14:03.210 --> 14:05.621
we said that we would be
producing the first plasma

14:05.645 --> 14:07.090
in 10 years.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.591
And if you guys do the
math real quickly,

14:08.615 --> 14:12.252
you realize that we're not ready
for first plasma next year.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.269
Not sure where I'm
gonna put this guy.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.205
It's a toad.

14:34.141 --> 14:37.653
- Where was that?
- He was inside the compost.

14:37.677 --> 14:41.190
So he digs underneath...
in the compost pile

14:41.214 --> 14:42.258
to stay warm.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.194
My problem is that I turn
the compost all the time,

14:45.218 --> 14:48.464
so I don't want him
to go in there again.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.023
I'm gonna put him
underneath here.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.137
Back when I started in fusion,

14:54.161 --> 14:58.107
back in the 19... mid-1980s,

14:58.131 --> 15:01.144
the idea was that fusion
was gonna be successful,

15:01.168 --> 15:04.413
and we would have
fusion on the grid

15:04.437 --> 15:06.649
in about 50 years.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.419
And now, it's, uh,
35 years into my...

15:10.443 --> 15:12.279
30 years into my career now.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.125
Up until about 2000,
the year 2000,

15:16.149 --> 15:18.094
we were just advancing
and advancing

15:18.118 --> 15:19.953
at really a fast rate.

15:20.687 --> 15:24.600
And now, the problem
is is that, uh,

15:24.624 --> 15:26.602
in order to make the next step,

15:26.626 --> 15:28.504
we just need to go
to a bigger machine

15:28.528 --> 15:30.406
and unfortunately,
bigger machines

15:30.430 --> 15:34.077
take longer to build,
are much more complex.

15:34.101 --> 15:39.215
I know that I will be retiring
before ITER's successful,

15:39.239 --> 15:42.385
so I'm like the guy
building a cathedral,

15:42.409 --> 15:45.588
who have... knows that he's
gonna be putting this brick on,

15:45.612 --> 15:46.755
this brick on, and
this brick on,

15:46.779 --> 15:48.457
and he's gonna be
spending his whole career

15:48.481 --> 15:49.558
putting bricks together,

15:49.582 --> 15:51.427
but he'll never see the
end piece, the cathedral,

15:51.451 --> 15:53.353
that will take hundreds
of years to build.

18:25.538 --> 18:29.152
My name is Evgeny Velikov,

18:29.176 --> 18:35.282
and now my main position
is honorary something.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.660
Are you optimistic,
Mister President.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.486
I'm always optimistic.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.431
I was gonna ask, do you want me to
explain the gyrotron real quick?

19:48.455 --> 19:50.590
Yeah, I can do it very
quickly and really cool.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.937
If you take... I don't
have a Coke bottle...

19:54.961 --> 19:56.972
If you take a Coke bottle
and you blow across

19:56.996 --> 19:58.574
the top of the Coke bottle...

19:58.598 --> 20:01.310
Do you mind... Can you get
me a Coke bottle downstairs?

20:01.334 --> 20:03.412
It's down over there.

20:03.436 --> 20:06.349
I have four minutes, no? How much?
Yes, four minutes.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.484
Four minutes? Is that okay?
It's downstairs.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.553
-Do you know where the
coffee machine is? -Yes.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.721
The gyrotron works pretty
much like a Coke bottle.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.258
Except instead of blowing across
the top of the Coke bottle

20:15.282 --> 20:16.459
and changing the resonance,

20:16.483 --> 20:19.995
uh, it-it... you-you
do a electron beam.

20:20.019 --> 20:23.299
You have basically a little...

20:23.323 --> 20:25.033
filament down here,
like in a light bulb.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.369
It heats up,

20:26.393 --> 20:29.305
and this beam of
electrons comes up,

20:29.329 --> 20:30.763
and you get a resonance.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.013
So just as you take your Coke bottle,
you blow across the top of it,

20:38.037 --> 20:40.883
and the wind is creating
a compression wave

20:40.907 --> 20:44.453
and making a resonance, making
the sound go up higher,

20:44.477 --> 20:47.290
this thing is passing
an electron beam,

20:47.314 --> 20:48.891
and it creates an
electromagnetic resonance.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.561
You can almost imagine it like
a bunch of little laser beams,

20:52.585 --> 20:57.400
that you combine them into
a single coherent beam,

20:57.424 --> 20:58.825
which is the gyrotron beam.

21:00.393 --> 21:03.739
And then once this
ignites the plasma,

21:03.763 --> 21:06.599
the plasma itself heats
it and keeps going.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.574
That makes sense, kind of.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.522
Oh, no, doesn't it have to
be a glass one? Oh, man!

21:19.546 --> 21:21.490
- Well...
- We lose the analogy.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.025
What do you do with the can?

21:23.049 --> 21:25.394
- No, not a can.
- A bottle, a bottle.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.562
Oh, you wanted a bottle?

21:26.586 --> 21:29.398
Yeah, because you can blow
across the top of the bottle

21:29.422 --> 21:30.499
to make it resonate.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.968
And you call yourself
a physicist.

21:42.369 --> 21:45.948
The greatest challenge is
to align these huge pieces

21:45.972 --> 21:49.518
to the millimeter tolerance,
to the accuracy that we need.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.619
It's really the magnets,

21:50.643 --> 21:53.346
the-the... what we call the
toroidal field magnets.

21:54.581 --> 21:57.426
These magnets make the main
magnetic field of ITER.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.695
They're the things that
hold this magnetic bottle,

21:59.719 --> 22:01.897
hold the plasma
inside the machine,

22:01.921 --> 22:02.998
and keep it away from the walls.

22:03.022 --> 22:06.101
And the accuracy that we
can install these magnets

22:06.125 --> 22:08.937
really is how smooth
the plasma will be

22:08.961 --> 22:10.373
and therefore how
well it performs.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.408
So the better we do
and the closer we get

22:12.432 --> 22:14.977
to the required position
for these magnets

22:15.001 --> 22:16.845
will really affect, for decades,

22:16.869 --> 22:18.146
the future performance of ITER.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.639
So that's a great
challenge for us.

23:50.830 --> 23:54.009
Well, you need some area,
of course, to absorb...

23:54.033 --> 23:55.968
- Yeah, yeah.
- The excess material.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.109
For sure.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.835
You cannot avoid that.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.820
I'm curing them. I'm
curing with my hand.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.879
Ahhh!

24:43.783 --> 24:46.294
It is not a work for
emotionally weak people,

24:46.318 --> 24:48.296
because you need to be
very strong and confident

24:48.320 --> 24:51.233
because otherwise... you
will never do anything.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.959
You'll just be so scared.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.579
Although ITER is called

25:03.603 --> 25:05.748
the largest scientific
enterprise,

25:05.772 --> 25:09.017
international collaboration
on Earth at the moment,

25:09.041 --> 25:10.218
nobody knows about us.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.755
ITER is, um...

25:12.779 --> 25:14.222
is working with public money,

25:14.246 --> 25:17.626
so the whole project
is jointly funded

25:17.650 --> 25:19.628
by all these nations
under the ITER roof,

25:19.652 --> 25:22.731
and so, in fact
it's the taxpayer

25:22.755 --> 25:24.266
who pays for what we do, right?

25:24.290 --> 25:27.069
So this is not a
private organization

25:27.093 --> 25:28.303
or a private enterprise.

25:28.327 --> 25:31.574
This is one of our
top benchmarks,

25:31.598 --> 25:33.776
that we develop this project

25:33.800 --> 25:37.846
and this fusion reactor for
the benefit of everything.

25:37.870 --> 25:41.183
And we want everybody
to share and to join in

25:41.207 --> 25:43.318
and to be proud of this, right?

25:43.342 --> 25:49.725
So transparency and having
an open-door policy

25:49.749 --> 25:53.119
is one of our top priorities
in ITER communications.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.633
A lot of people talk
about a magnetic model,

25:57.657 --> 25:59.735
and I don't feel there's
a good understanding

25:59.759 --> 26:01.804
of how the magnetic field ties

26:01.828 --> 26:04.039
-with this idea of trapping a particle.
-Mm-hmm.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.041
And then I want to go into
the challenge of ITER.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.077
The question is, well, how
come we're taking a long time?

26:09.101 --> 26:10.879
They made a study back in 1976

26:10.903 --> 26:13.749
that showed that depending
upon how you fund fusion,

26:13.773 --> 26:16.384
you can either get
a fusion device

26:16.408 --> 26:19.187
generating electricity
somewhere in the 1990s

26:19.211 --> 26:22.991
out to 2006 all depending upon
how much money you put in

26:23.015 --> 26:24.660
as a functional time.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.629
And then I'm going
to overlay this

26:26.653 --> 26:29.264
as what the US has
actually been funding.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.699
And the funding has gone up.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.868
It peaked around 1978

26:32.892 --> 26:36.963
and then has dropped well below,
based on today's dollars.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.174
It's very understandable,
very honest,

26:39.198 --> 26:42.978
but I won't do this because we
have the US here on Monday,

26:43.002 --> 26:44.980
uh, physically, and...

26:45.004 --> 26:46.048
it's a very touchy
thing in the US.

26:46.072 --> 26:49.251
Because here you're picking
out the US from the...

26:49.275 --> 26:50.318
We have to be careful we don't,

26:50.342 --> 26:53.388
in official presentation,
want to criticize, right?

26:53.412 --> 26:56.825
We can say it's difficult.
Right?

26:56.849 --> 27:00.328
Because, um, in the 70s,
the funding was wow.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.731
Everybody wanted
fusion to happen now.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.000
-Then everything dropped again.
Right? -Poof! Yeah.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.369
We survived. We managed to
survive, and we're here now

27:07.393 --> 27:10.038
building the world's
largest fusion device.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.775
But it's hard, and
it only happens,

27:12.799 --> 27:16.278
and we say we can deliver, uh,

27:16.302 --> 27:18.847
around the mid of the century...

27:18.871 --> 27:21.884
provided that we have
somebody sort of...

27:21.908 --> 27:24.228
-Funding us in the back.
- funding us in the back. Right?

27:48.134 --> 27:51.113
And so to me, before
we basically die

27:51.137 --> 27:53.982
in our excrement like
yeast molecules,

27:54.006 --> 27:57.085
we need to realize that we
need another energy source.

27:57.109 --> 27:59.454
We need to be... It may not
be for our generation.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.924
I mean, the good news
is we're, we're okay.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.392
But it's the next generation
or the generation after that

28:04.416 --> 28:05.527
or the generation after that.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.463
Yeah, I'm actually surprised
how low the funding is.

28:08.487 --> 28:11.800
Would you be able to have, er...

28:11.824 --> 28:15.738
better progress, faster progress
if you had better funding?

28:15.762 --> 28:17.806
I think so. There was a study
made in one country...

28:17.830 --> 28:19.407
I'm not gonna name
the country...

28:19.431 --> 28:20.909
Back in the 70s.

28:20.933 --> 28:24.747
And they said if you keep
the level of the order

28:24.771 --> 28:26.348
of, let's say, I
think it was about

28:26.372 --> 28:29.017
800 million euros per year,

28:29.041 --> 28:33.188
you would be able to achieve
an ITER-like machine,

28:33.212 --> 28:35.223
uh, within about 20 years.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.893
Then if you drop it down
to about 500 million,

28:37.917 --> 28:40.495
it would be extended
out to about 30 years.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.497
And there is a point
of no return,

28:42.521 --> 28:46.201
where basically if you
invested 300 million euros

28:46.225 --> 28:47.169
on a year-to-year basis,

28:47.193 --> 28:50.105
you would actually...
It would take infinity

28:50.129 --> 28:51.406
to achieve a reactor.

28:51.430 --> 28:55.143
Because there you had to keep
the supporting technology base,

28:55.167 --> 28:57.179
the administrative funds.

28:57.203 --> 29:01.149
If you go below 300 million,
you'll never get fusion.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.517
Well...

29:02.541 --> 29:04.052
that country has never invested

29:04.076 --> 29:06.088
more than something
like 200 million euros.

29:06.112 --> 29:09.024
The more money you put into
it, the faster the return.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.559
And-And we really have
been putting in peanuts.

29:11.583 --> 29:15.931
I don't think there's a
broad public acceptance

29:15.955 --> 29:19.567
of hydrogen fusion in the
United States at this stage.

29:19.591 --> 29:24.339
Uh, people back in the
US still in general

29:24.363 --> 29:25.874
don't understand the differences

29:25.898 --> 29:28.410
between uranium fission,

29:28.434 --> 29:32.347
which is the process that's been
used in nuclear power plants

29:32.371 --> 29:34.249
for over 40 years now,

29:34.273 --> 29:36.284
and hydrogen fusion,

29:36.308 --> 29:39.321
uh, which is believe is the
process of the future.

29:39.345 --> 29:43.025
You have to keep in mind a
couple of things, you know.

29:43.049 --> 29:46.561
First, this is one of the grand
challenges of engineering.

29:46.585 --> 29:51.033
And solving a grand
challenge on a fixed price

29:51.057 --> 29:54.336
is, is a challenge
in and of itself.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.271
Now, by the same token,

29:56.295 --> 30:00.876
you have to be very cost and
schedule conscience... conscious,

30:00.900 --> 30:04.012
because the sponsors of
this project have to,

30:04.036 --> 30:06.581
you know, continue to
maintain their sponsorship

30:06.605 --> 30:08.917
and believe strongly

30:08.941 --> 30:11.043
that the cost is worth
the investment.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.560
I actually got interested
in fusion as a child.

30:18.584 --> 30:22.030
Uh, my mom, when I was eight,

30:22.054 --> 30:24.599
got me what I think was
my first science book,

30:24.623 --> 30:26.568
which was about the sun.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.337
And I still remember
vividly this illustration

30:29.361 --> 30:34.209
of this hundreds of millions
of miles long coal train

30:34.233 --> 30:38.881
delivering all the coal
that equaled the energy

30:38.905 --> 30:42.484
that the sun's fusion
created in a single second.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.887
By the time I graduated,

30:44.911 --> 30:47.089
I actually didn't intend
to go into fusion

30:47.113 --> 30:52.227
because this was the high
point of the enthusiasm

30:52.251 --> 30:54.029
about the tokamak device,

30:54.053 --> 30:58.166
which is still the most
funded device in fusion.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.936
And I thought, "Well, I
guess this is solved,"

31:00.960 --> 31:03.071
and I got interested instead

31:03.095 --> 31:05.164
in astrophysics
and other things.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.643
But, um...

31:08.667 --> 31:10.946
pretty soon it
became clear, nope,

31:10.970 --> 31:12.404
it wasn't solved.

31:17.009 --> 31:20.422
The first error that was made
by the government programs

31:20.446 --> 31:22.624
back in the 1970s

31:22.648 --> 31:26.594
was to put all their eggs
in the tokamak basket.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.331
Now, 40 years later,

31:29.355 --> 31:34.102
people would have to say,
objectively we do not know

31:34.126 --> 31:39.107
which route will lead
to practical fusion,

31:39.131 --> 31:41.944
and we certainly don't
know which route will lead

31:41.968 --> 31:44.279
to the most economical fusion.

31:44.303 --> 31:49.384
What you have to do is take
a crash program approach,

31:49.408 --> 31:51.053
a broad-based approach

31:51.077 --> 31:54.189
in which, if there are 20
good ideas out there...

31:54.213 --> 31:56.624
And by good ideas,
I don't mean ideas

31:56.648 --> 31:58.726
that I think will work.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.464
I mean ideas that I
can't prove won't work.

32:02.488 --> 32:06.401
This is an important vital
question for humanity:

32:06.425 --> 32:10.238
What is an energy source that
can replace fossil fuels,

32:10.262 --> 32:14.676
that can be safe,
clean, unlimited,

32:14.700 --> 32:17.045
and more economical,

32:17.069 --> 32:19.338
cheaper than anything
we have today?

32:23.775 --> 32:25.520
I used to live on Bowen Island,

32:25.544 --> 32:26.721
so the commute was great.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.223
So I could get on my bike

32:28.247 --> 32:30.349
and it was, like, a 10
minute bike to the garage.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.530
The part will arrive, and I
would assemble all the parts,

32:35.554 --> 32:38.100
and I will actually do all
the experiments myself.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.735
There is only one guy here.
It's a one-guy show.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.195
So that was actually quite fun.
I enjoyed that.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.108
And then I would build
this machinery,

32:46.132 --> 32:49.077
and then I will fire it up, and
then I would get bad result,

32:49.101 --> 32:50.212
which is most of the
time you get that.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.614
And then I will tweak it and
adjust with a little click

32:52.638 --> 32:53.948
and some transfer somewhere.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.751
And then I started to get some
neutron coming out of this thing.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.245
So I was very excited
about my neutrons.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.290
Then, eventually, I went out

33:02.314 --> 33:04.250
and tried to raise more
money with that thing.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.199
The company got bigger
and more successful,

33:11.223 --> 33:13.992
but the fun went
downhill since then.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.585
Now, after my PhD,
sadly, I did not manage

33:30.609 --> 33:32.187
to find a job in fusion.

33:32.211 --> 33:35.290
So I got a job at a local
company doing laser printer,

33:35.314 --> 33:37.125
because I was kind
of good with lasers.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.661
Turns out that what
I was trying to do

33:39.685 --> 33:43.065
was trying to make printing so
cheap that we could cut the forest

33:43.089 --> 33:45.333
and jam you with
junk mail, you know.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.135
So that was not
very satisfactory.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.704
And I was looking at the energy
situation on the planet,

33:49.728 --> 33:51.005
and it was pretty bad.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.142
I think we're going 100 miles
an hour towards a brick wall,

33:54.166 --> 33:56.344
and nobody seems to be paying
much attention, you know.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.414
And it was actually on my birthday,
the 40-years-old birthday,

33:59.438 --> 34:02.184
and I decided I had a
terrible midlife crisis,

34:02.208 --> 34:04.319
and I say, okay,
I-I-I will change.

34:04.343 --> 34:07.455
I will not do this job
anymore, and I will do fusion.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.391
In the center of the machine,
there's a big sphere

34:10.416 --> 34:12.427
and in that sphere,
there is liquid metal.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.661
Now the liquid metal is
pumped by some pumps

34:14.686 --> 34:16.098
in those pipes over there,

34:16.121 --> 34:17.264
and it's made up to swirl.

34:17.289 --> 34:20.534
So the-the liquid is injected
near the edge like this,

34:20.559 --> 34:21.703
and it swirls around.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.804
And because it swirls around,
it appear in the center,

34:23.829 --> 34:26.474
like a centrifugal force
keep the liquid out

34:26.498 --> 34:29.210
and near the center... Up
near the center of the thing.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.746
So we fire those 14 pistons
all at the same time,

34:31.770 --> 34:33.181
and they're quite
well-synchronized.

34:33.205 --> 34:37.119
It's gonna go clonk,
clonk, clonk!

34:37.143 --> 34:39.721
And then the acoustic
waves squash the liquid,

34:39.745 --> 34:42.290
and it collapse the
vortex over the plasma.

34:42.313 --> 34:44.592
And the plasma, when you
compress it, will get hotter.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.728
And hopefully we will hit
150 million degrees C,

34:47.753 --> 34:48.896
which is the
temperature required

34:48.920 --> 34:50.732
to make the nucleus to fuse.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.400
It's piston, and it's rings.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.536
It's, uh, it's metal and pipes.
It's plumbing.

34:55.561 --> 34:58.273
Turning that into a power
plant will actually be

34:58.297 --> 35:00.475
not that complicated.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.544
I have, I have a saying
here at General Fusion

35:02.568 --> 35:05.880
I told all my engineer, "If you
can't find it at Home Depot,

35:05.904 --> 35:07.749
it doesn't go in the machine."

35:07.773 --> 35:09.617
So the tokamak and the
laser fusion have

35:09.641 --> 35:11.486
more chance of working
than what we do here,

35:11.510 --> 35:14.589
because the physics of
compressing the plasma

35:14.613 --> 35:16.358
with a magnetic field is new.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.826
However, their chance of
turning out a power plant

35:18.850 --> 35:20.895
that's cost effective is low,

35:20.919 --> 35:23.565
because their machine
is so complicated.

35:23.589 --> 35:26.234
I-I'm quite confident that
we can make this work,

35:26.258 --> 35:27.669
and I'm a little concerned

35:27.693 --> 35:30.662
that we might run out of money
before we make it work.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.782
We have everywhere problems.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.919
We have had problems
in the TF coils,

36:17.943 --> 36:19.887
uh, and it was solved.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.457
Uh, we-we could go
into the envelope

36:22.481 --> 36:24.692
with the help of Japan,
Europe, and so on.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.229
So, many things we could bring

36:27.253 --> 36:29.297
into a reasonable
envelope of schedule,

36:29.321 --> 36:31.266
but we cannot make miracles.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.302
Time lost is lost.
I cannot recover.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.438
It can only be
better from now on.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.640
The problem that I
don't understand is

36:38.664 --> 36:40.842
how are you gonna get
there 10 years from now?

36:40.866 --> 36:42.410
'Cause we heard this morning

36:42.434 --> 36:44.479
there's a problem with
the vacuum vessel,

36:44.503 --> 36:47.014
tooling issues, all
kind of things.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.552
I don't see what the plan is.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.255
But I thought you have
a much better plan,

36:53.279 --> 36:55.457
uh, when it comes to
the technologies,

36:55.481 --> 36:57.449
engineering the solutions.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.027
Whatever that is, I
mean, convince us

37:00.051 --> 37:02.530
that I think we can get
there within 10 years.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.966
This morning when
I asked the DG,

37:04.990 --> 37:08.303
what was the failure of
this whole problem was,

37:08.327 --> 37:09.871
and wasting 10 years,

37:09.895 --> 37:11.406
he said he was a manager.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.940
Right?

37:12.964 --> 37:15.301
Is there any change?
Doing anything?

38:17.429 --> 38:19.574
There's a lot depending
on ITER, right?

38:19.598 --> 38:24.612
So the whole fusion research
going on all around the world,

38:24.636 --> 38:27.949
whether it's in China,
in Europe, in the US,

38:27.973 --> 38:29.351
they all depend on ITER.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.653
So if ITER is closed down,

38:31.677 --> 38:34.356
a lot of people will not
only lose their jobs,

38:34.380 --> 38:38.626
but, um, fusion will be dead

38:38.650 --> 38:40.695
forever or at least for
a very, very long time.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.655
Nobody will ever bet on
fusion for a long time.

39:02.941 --> 39:06.745
So this is our facility where...

39:08.013 --> 39:13.351
You know, storage facility,
which is actually quite cheap.

39:14.085 --> 39:15.730
The key thing is,

39:15.754 --> 39:18.466
more money has to go
into fusion research.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.168
It has to go for
many other devices,

39:21.192 --> 39:23.562
obviously including our own.

39:27.833 --> 39:31.178
We and our neighbors are
shielded against the neutrons

39:31.202 --> 39:33.481
by three feet of concrete.

39:33.505 --> 39:36.951
It's also shielded
by this copper mesh

39:36.975 --> 39:39.987
that radio waves
can't get through.

39:40.011 --> 39:43.691
Now, the main bang trigger
is basically a big switch.

39:43.715 --> 39:47.895
When we're at full power,
all 12 will be hooked up.

39:47.919 --> 39:51.533
These instruments are
actually our thermometer.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.835
If you wonder how
can you measure

39:53.859 --> 39:57.505
one or two billion
degrees, this is it.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.508
Maybe there's some way you
could tape this so that

40:00.532 --> 40:02.677
- it's out of the line of sight.
- Okay.

40:02.701 --> 40:06.614
Even though we're a
very tiny group,

40:06.638 --> 40:09.551
science is a
collaborative effort,

40:09.575 --> 40:13.087
and we're collaborating through
the scientific literature

40:13.111 --> 40:14.913
with people all
around the world.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.161
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.830
You're on camera.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.032
This is an important
member of the team.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.869
This is Tom, who's
the landlord here.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.427
Hey, guys.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.140
People ask, "How can you succeed

40:33.164 --> 40:35.810
with so few resources?"

40:35.834 --> 40:38.646
You know, are you saying you're
a thousand times smarter?

40:38.670 --> 40:39.814
No.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.040
We're saying we've
got an easier route.

40:43.709 --> 40:44.986
A plasma,

40:45.010 --> 40:48.490
which is what most of the
universe consists of,

40:48.514 --> 40:51.225
is electrically
conducting matter,

40:51.249 --> 40:54.862
matter in which the
electrons are stripped away

40:54.886 --> 40:57.832
from the atoms and can
freely move about.

40:57.856 --> 41:00.835
What we today call
the "pinch effect"

41:00.859 --> 41:06.140
forms instabilities
within the plasma,

41:06.164 --> 41:07.809
basically pinching the plasma

41:07.833 --> 41:11.245
into a lot of
filamentary structures.

41:11.269 --> 41:17.852
The conventional attitude
towards the instabilities

41:17.876 --> 41:19.053
is to suppress them.

41:19.077 --> 41:23.481
As we put it, to make the plasma
sit still like a good dog.

41:24.783 --> 41:26.994
The problem with that is
the plasma doesn't want

41:27.018 --> 41:28.062
to sit still.

41:28.086 --> 41:32.133
And trying to confine the
plasma for long enough

41:32.157 --> 41:34.802
for the fusion reactions
to take place

41:34.826 --> 41:38.139
becomes sort of like
confining a can of worms

41:38.163 --> 41:39.698
without the can.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.846
What we do is to imitate nature.

41:44.870 --> 41:50.685
In nature, on a scale of...
solar flares,

41:50.709 --> 41:53.755
quasars, entire galaxies,

41:53.779 --> 41:57.859
these filaments organize and
structure the universe.

41:57.883 --> 41:59.551
What's your trigger pressure?

42:00.351 --> 42:02.053
It's 12.36.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.625
So when the machine fires,

42:07.258 --> 42:10.037
we get a ion beam

42:10.061 --> 42:12.063
that goes down this drift tube.

42:13.632 --> 42:15.577
Once the machine fires,

42:15.601 --> 42:17.745
then it's the job of
all our instruments

42:17.769 --> 42:19.781
to find out what
actually happened.

42:19.805 --> 42:21.539
Everybody ready?

42:22.207 --> 42:24.810
Power on. Charging.

42:26.678 --> 42:29.891
So what we do in
the plasma focus

42:29.915 --> 42:32.794
is we don't try and fight
these instabilities,

42:32.818 --> 42:36.063
we try to use them to
compress the plasma

42:36.087 --> 42:37.088
and to confine them.

42:38.356 --> 42:39.825
Twenty...

42:42.360 --> 42:43.729
thirty.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.097
Set. Fire.

42:48.299 --> 42:51.212
That means the device
can be much smaller.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.915
The energy can be much
more concentrated,

42:53.939 --> 42:56.174
and that makes the
device much cheaper.

42:57.709 --> 42:59.711
Now, that was a free fire.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.114
Didn't you hear that?

43:06.985 --> 43:08.896
I just want to make sure
it's not self-firing.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.365
There was a slight
ticking noise in there

43:11.389 --> 43:12.991
I couldn't identify.

43:15.193 --> 43:16.971
The scope still set?

43:16.995 --> 43:18.596
They're dry.

43:19.865 --> 43:21.142
Power on.

43:24.035 --> 43:25.136
Charging.

43:28.974 --> 43:30.208
Ten...

43:33.144 --> 43:34.212
twenty...

43:35.413 --> 43:36.815
thirty.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.226
Set. Fire.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.828
Nope.

43:40.852 --> 43:45.399
We know of no reason why this
is physically impossible.

43:45.423 --> 43:48.870
And more, no one has told us

43:48.894 --> 43:52.406
a reason why they think this
is physically impossible.

43:52.430 --> 43:54.909
And this project is a
very public project.

43:54.933 --> 43:57.936
We've published in
peer-reviewed papers...

43:59.070 --> 44:03.751
that are among the leading
journals in our field.

44:03.775 --> 44:05.753
We've gotten a lot
of press coverage.

44:05.777 --> 44:09.290
People have a lot of opportunity
to take potshots at us.

44:09.314 --> 44:12.426
Some people say this
is a long shot,

44:12.450 --> 44:14.762
this is way out.

44:14.786 --> 44:18.900
Well, ultimately, they're just
expressing their feeling.

44:18.924 --> 44:23.695
I do say that compared
with all the other...

44:25.163 --> 44:26.774
private fusion efforts...

44:26.798 --> 44:30.068
our results at present
are the best.

44:32.103 --> 44:35.941
So, here-here... Tom just
became our latest shareholder.

44:36.775 --> 44:39.077
Yeah.

44:42.981 --> 44:44.783
Okay...

44:56.361 --> 45:00.074
It's my pleasure to
welcome all of you.

45:00.098 --> 45:01.809
I introduce myself.

45:01.833 --> 45:05.947
I'm the director-general
of the ITER organization.

45:05.971 --> 45:08.816
It is really my
honor and pleasure

45:08.840 --> 45:13.888
to address you here
today in this role.

45:13.912 --> 45:19.150
This little project as you know
is a very promising project,

45:20.886 --> 45:25.023
which now gathers
seven large parties.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.534
All of them as you know,

45:27.558 --> 45:30.171
they're representing
over 85 percent

45:30.195 --> 45:33.775
of the gross national
product in the world,

45:33.799 --> 45:36.010
and all of them are
very keen to understand

45:36.034 --> 45:40.514
how they will get their energy
supply in the long term.

45:40.538 --> 45:44.185
All of you know that there
is renewable energies,

45:44.209 --> 45:48.522
and we are very keen to see
these renewable energies

45:48.546 --> 45:50.982
to move on, to progress.

45:52.083 --> 45:55.529
But for the time
being, it is clear

45:55.553 --> 45:57.531
that it will not be able

45:57.555 --> 46:00.401
to fulfill the
expectations of the world.

46:00.425 --> 46:02.193
Oh, sorry.

46:03.895 --> 46:06.097
I will... I will say stop.

46:07.332 --> 46:08.766
Hello?

46:24.549 --> 46:26.027
Sorry.

46:26.051 --> 46:28.295
We are always
interconnected, so...

46:28.319 --> 46:33.034
As you know, renewable
energy is good for...

46:33.058 --> 46:34.969
I think we all
have great respect

46:34.993 --> 46:36.570
for what he's trying to do here,

46:36.594 --> 46:37.638
what he has to do.

46:37.662 --> 46:40.298
We are all standing behind
him, to help him to...

46:41.532 --> 46:43.510
to get the big puzzle together.

46:43.534 --> 46:45.112
It's different, right?

46:45.136 --> 46:48.182
I mean, the first two
director-generals were Japanese

46:48.206 --> 46:50.885
and certainly, um,

46:50.909 --> 46:53.354
different cultures have
different approaches

46:53.378 --> 46:55.322
to... to work with,

46:55.346 --> 46:56.924
uh, different priorities,

46:56.948 --> 46:59.894
and Mr. Bigot is a European.

46:59.918 --> 47:02.163
So for us Europeans,
it's certainly easier,

47:02.187 --> 47:04.065
right, to understand
what he wants.

47:04.089 --> 47:07.434
But if it is possible
to demonstrate

47:07.458 --> 47:10.037
and it will work for, okay,

47:10.061 --> 47:12.039
thousand and thousand of euros,

47:12.063 --> 47:13.975
I'm ready to wait for 20 years.

47:13.999 --> 47:15.433
Is not my problem.

47:19.037 --> 47:21.048
No, no, no, you know,
the sun is not obsolete

47:21.072 --> 47:22.616
even after five
billion of years.

48:00.645 --> 48:02.489
Well, I think there is something

48:02.513 --> 48:03.991
inherently difficult
about fusion.

48:04.015 --> 48:06.393
That it is, uh, an
attempt to harness

48:06.417 --> 48:09.496
some of the most difficult-
to-harness forces in nature.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.232
You have to get something

48:11.256 --> 48:14.135
at tens or hundreds of
millions of degrees Kelvin

48:14.159 --> 48:16.938
into a tight package, and
nature resists that.

48:16.962 --> 48:18.605
So tha-that is inherently hard.

48:18.629 --> 48:21.399
But on top of that, um...

48:22.567 --> 48:24.678
there seem to be
political pressures

48:24.702 --> 48:28.015
trying to blow apart
any large project.

48:28.039 --> 48:31.052
That once you have to
gather many, many people

48:31.076 --> 48:35.957
from different countries
to combine resources,

48:35.981 --> 48:38.425
especially over
decades and decades,

48:38.449 --> 48:42.629
the different political
wills, the different goals,

48:42.653 --> 48:45.032
uh, all clash with each other

48:45.056 --> 48:47.601
and eventually you wind
up with infighting,

48:47.625 --> 48:49.270
with cost overruns,

48:49.294 --> 48:52.306
and things begin to fall
apart after several years.

48:52.330 --> 48:54.976
And this is what we saw
with ITER round one,

48:55.000 --> 48:56.710
and the same thing seems
to be happening again,

48:56.734 --> 48:58.403
uh, with round two.

49:09.414 --> 49:11.592
I am often asked the question,

49:11.616 --> 49:13.627
how do you maintain
a sense of urgency

49:13.651 --> 49:16.430
on a project that takes
20 years or more?

49:16.454 --> 49:21.202
Yeah? And so the answer
is that globally...

49:21.226 --> 49:23.204
'Cause for this crowd,
the Apollo Project

49:23.228 --> 49:25.206
is what they always
think about as the...

49:25.230 --> 49:29.010
That if we think about
how short for most of us

49:29.034 --> 49:31.145
20 years ago really seems and
all that has happened...

49:31.169 --> 49:34.181
The Secretary of Energy
was asked specifically

49:34.205 --> 49:37.218
to make a recommendation by
the second of May this year

49:37.242 --> 49:39.386
on that topic, a
progress report on ITER,

49:39.410 --> 49:41.788
and should the US stay
in or should they not.

49:41.812 --> 49:45.392
Yeah, I think that
it's quite clear

49:45.416 --> 49:48.262
that, uh, things are moving
in a positive direction,

49:48.286 --> 49:51.732
but we were digging out of
a fairly significant hole,

49:51.756 --> 49:54.468
and so progress was
really necessary.

49:54.492 --> 49:57.304
It's up to the American
Congress to make the decision,

49:57.328 --> 50:00.598
you know, if the
project will deliver.

50:11.509 --> 50:14.588
Sub-Committee on Energy
will come to order.

50:14.612 --> 50:18.059
And we wanna welcome you to
today's hearing entitled,

50:18.083 --> 50:21.128
"An Overview of Fusion
Energy Science."

50:21.152 --> 50:23.364
Is it ee-ter or eye-ter?

50:23.388 --> 50:25.299
- Ee-ter.
- Ee-ter. Hmm. Okay.

50:25.323 --> 50:27.801
Tokamak. I keep wanting
to say "Tomahawk,"

50:27.825 --> 50:29.403
and I know that's...

50:29.427 --> 50:30.771
that's not right.

50:30.795 --> 50:34.441
With the complexity of a multi-national
collaboration like ITER,

50:34.465 --> 50:38.579
this project has faced
more challenges than most.

50:38.603 --> 50:41.082
Fortunately, today, we have
the opportunity to hear

50:41.106 --> 50:43.350
from the director-general of
the ITER project directly,

50:43.374 --> 50:46.353
Dr. Bernard... Is it Bee-go?

50:46.377 --> 50:49.256
Uh, I do believe if we have
the proper management,

50:49.280 --> 50:51.825
we will be able to
deliver on time.

50:51.849 --> 50:53.694
We have spent how much money

50:53.718 --> 50:55.496
over the last ten years,
the United States?

50:55.520 --> 50:57.698
When the US signed
up for the project,

50:57.722 --> 50:59.366
you know, the
representation was made

50:59.390 --> 51:01.202
that this project
was ready to go

51:01.226 --> 51:02.769
to an extent that,
in retrospect,

51:02.793 --> 51:03.937
probably wasn't the case.

51:03.961 --> 51:08.575
When you think about what we
spent on imported oil alone...

51:08.599 --> 51:12.313
I just want to understand
the dimensions of the cliff

51:12.337 --> 51:14.815
that we're playing near when we
talk about the US pulling out.

51:14.839 --> 51:19.186
If you're gonna have to lay
odds on, on all the engineering

51:19.210 --> 51:21.488
and all these things
coming together,

51:21.512 --> 51:24.225
uh... what are your odds?

51:24.249 --> 51:27.728
I do believe this project
could be so beneficial

51:27.752 --> 51:30.764
to the world, that
it is really worth

51:30.788 --> 51:32.733
to try and to demonstrate.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.601
- And again...
- Let me mention this.

51:34.625 --> 51:38.172
There are a lot of wonderful
things we can do in this world.

51:38.196 --> 51:40.541
- I know.
- Wonderful things.

51:40.565 --> 51:41.875
- And...
- Including ITER.

51:41.899 --> 51:44.611
Yeah, um, okay. And ITER
may be one of them,

51:44.635 --> 51:48.615
but what we do is we judge
each one based on the cost

51:48.639 --> 51:51.618
and the chances of success.

51:51.642 --> 51:55.256
Because, in theory, it's such
a beautiful and simple idea.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.391
Yet, throughout,
people have found

51:57.415 --> 52:00.627
as soon as they get
around the next corner,

52:00.651 --> 52:02.763
there is yet another hurdle.

52:02.787 --> 52:05.699
Um, and nature seems
to have this way

52:05.723 --> 52:07.668
of throwing up, um,

52:07.692 --> 52:11.238
blockade after blockade
after blockade that makes

52:11.262 --> 52:14.632
scientists' optimism,
uh, look naive.

52:16.567 --> 52:19.446
My favorite fusion conman,

52:19.470 --> 52:22.440
uh, was Richter from Argentina.

52:25.776 --> 52:28.489
He was a German or
Austrian expat...

52:28.513 --> 52:30.924
We actually know very
little about him...

52:30.948 --> 52:33.960
Who moved to Argentina

52:33.984 --> 52:36.330
and managed to
convince Juan Peron

52:36.354 --> 52:37.831
that he had figured out a method

52:37.855 --> 52:40.801
of, uh, harnessing the sun

52:40.825 --> 52:42.427
and called it thermotron.

52:43.728 --> 52:46.631
And so they built this
secret lab on an island.

52:47.565 --> 52:52.313
And this crazy expat
was running around

52:52.337 --> 52:53.947
pouring gunpowder
in experiments,

52:53.971 --> 52:55.849
blowing doors off his lab,

52:55.873 --> 52:58.319
writing fusion on ticker
tapes everywhere,

52:58.343 --> 53:01.555
convincing everyone for a
matter of months and years

53:01.579 --> 53:04.782
that he has solved the
world's energy problems.

53:17.928 --> 53:20.807
Until he was finally found out
as a fraud and wound up in jail.

53:25.336 --> 53:28.014
One of the things that's
interesting about his story

53:28.038 --> 53:31.485
is that the physicists

53:31.509 --> 53:34.788
who first thought
about magnetic fusion

53:34.812 --> 53:35.989
were inspired by his story.

53:36.013 --> 53:40.827
They saw a front page
New York Times claim

53:40.851 --> 53:43.897
about fusion energy
in Argentina,

53:43.921 --> 53:45.599
and the scientists
here were thinking,

53:45.623 --> 53:47.358
how could that be done?

53:55.633 --> 53:58.345
My wife and I were planning
to leave for Aspen,

53:58.369 --> 53:59.646
and my father, he said,

53:59.670 --> 54:02.516
"Well, I understand the
Argentines have, uh,

54:02.540 --> 54:05.386
have gotten ahead of you
in the fusion program."

54:05.410 --> 54:08.522
He'd seen the New
York Times article

54:08.546 --> 54:12.326
that a fellow named Richter
had released fusion

54:12.350 --> 54:14.027
in a controlled
manner in Argentina,

54:14.051 --> 54:16.430
and Peron made quite
a thing of it.

54:16.454 --> 54:17.964
I read the New York
Times article.

54:17.988 --> 54:21.392
Then we got on a
train down to Aspen.

54:32.002 --> 54:35.682
It was during the intervals out
there, when we weren't skiing,

54:35.706 --> 54:37.484
I was thinking about this.

54:37.508 --> 54:41.388
How would one do it if
one were trying to?

54:41.412 --> 54:44.491
I worked out some of
the general ideas

54:44.515 --> 54:48.786
that I later developed
into the stellarator.

54:50.388 --> 54:53.033
So Spitzer came up
with this cool device

54:53.057 --> 54:54.568
called the stellarator.

54:54.592 --> 54:57.070
Stellarators are a
complicated machine,

54:57.094 --> 54:59.740
and they have worse
confinement in general.

54:59.764 --> 55:02.743
But there's no such thing as
disruption in a stellarator.

55:02.767 --> 55:05.746
And so stellarators
for the past decade

55:05.770 --> 55:07.548
have just been more
and more complicated.

55:07.572 --> 55:10.016
They look like squid fighting
each other at this point.

55:10.040 --> 55:13.820
You can specify what magnetic
field configuration you want.

55:13.844 --> 55:16.823
So then you give the computer
the job of iterating

55:16.847 --> 55:18.525
through a bunch of
possible different coils

55:18.549 --> 55:21.362
until it gets to the right
magnetic field configuration.

55:21.386 --> 55:23.830
And you end up with
something weird, like this.

55:23.854 --> 55:25.198
It's cool, right?

55:25.222 --> 55:28.426
All right, any other questions
before we move on to the tokamak?

55:29.494 --> 55:30.895
Okay, let's bust a move.

55:53.484 --> 55:56.029
So W7-X is a really
cool experiment.

55:56.053 --> 55:58.031
It's a stellarator which has

55:58.055 --> 55:59.633
a lot of advantages
over a tokamak.

55:59.657 --> 56:01.668
The biggest advantage is
that it can just run.

56:01.692 --> 56:05.739
It just... You know,
for hours hopefully.

56:05.763 --> 56:08.609
And once you can do that, you
can build a power plant.

56:08.633 --> 56:11.745
Um, and so tokamaks right
now have a problem

56:11.769 --> 56:14.080
where they just, they
can't run continuously,

56:14.104 --> 56:16.049
but this experiment is
designed to show that

56:16.073 --> 56:17.183
it can be done continuously

56:17.207 --> 56:20.887
at parameters that are good
enough for fusion, so...

56:20.911 --> 56:23.189
I came here, and I came to
know about stellarators

56:23.213 --> 56:25.158
and somewhere along
the line, I switched

56:25.182 --> 56:28.795
from believing in tokamaks
to more in stellarators,

56:28.819 --> 56:30.096
and I thought, yeah,

56:30.120 --> 56:31.989
maybe this is the future
of energy and fusion.

56:35.092 --> 56:38.171
This project would not
have been possible

56:38.195 --> 56:39.906
without the reunion of Germany.

56:39.930 --> 56:44.044
It is co-financed by
Europe to a big extent.

56:44.068 --> 56:47.213
But still the project
team is in our hands.

56:47.237 --> 56:50.517
We had to take care that
we have young people

56:50.541 --> 56:53.086
being able to do physics
now with the new machine

56:53.110 --> 56:56.590
and really to make this a team.

56:56.614 --> 57:01.595
Wendelstein is a highly
optimized stellerator device,

57:01.619 --> 57:02.963
three-dimensional design.

57:02.987 --> 57:05.065
It goes back about 20 years.

57:05.089 --> 57:09.002
And, um, to build this, to get
the support to build this,

57:09.026 --> 57:12.673
they had to build it in the
then-reuniting Germany.

57:12.697 --> 57:14.708
It's a crucial
part of the story.

57:14.732 --> 57:16.977
So they started a
completely new institute

57:17.001 --> 57:18.545
from nothing up here.

57:18.569 --> 57:22.849
And they had to go into building something
that had never been built before.

57:22.873 --> 57:27.187
Now, unsurprisingly, it
ended up being more complex

57:27.211 --> 57:29.980
and expensive and difficult
than they planned.

59:56.994 --> 59:59.372
Big emotion. Big
emotion, you know.

59:59.396 --> 01:00:01.908
I do believe it's
really a landmark

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:06.747
in the history of fusion to
see with these stellarators

01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:08.381
it works right away.

01:00:08.405 --> 01:00:09.716
Very good.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.918
She's a really great scientist,

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:15.355
and she know how to organize
the work of this people

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:17.423
to give good priorities,

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.793
and I really believe she deserve

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:21.962
full recognition for
her achievement.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.277
Well, this fusion business

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.780
has been going a little slower
than we were all hoping

01:00:39.804 --> 01:00:41.114
when we started this company.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.282
We started with great gusto,

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:44.317
"Yeah, we're gonna
whisk that up."

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:46.419
And then we ran
into difficulties,

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:49.055
so it's a little longer
than what we wanted.

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:51.291
So it's a little bit
more challenging.

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:55.095
But we-we're still optimistic
that we're doing good progress.

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.763
It's going a little
slower than I'd like,

01:00:56.787 --> 01:00:58.298
but it's-it's advancing forward.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.499
So we're not kind of stopped.

01:00:59.523 --> 01:01:03.369
So mood is okay, but now we're,
we're kind of gearing up

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:07.373
for a bit more of a long run
than a, than a quick success.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:09.209
We're certainly not
the startup anymore,

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:13.413
like we used to be a real
scruffy little startup,

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:15.882
but now we're getting
more people,

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:18.484
it's a bigger shop, and
been here for a few years.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.144
We have shown some result.

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:23.389
This is 1,500 microseconds.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:24.958
The compression time is only

01:01:24.982 --> 01:01:27.894
180 microseconds, a
little time here.

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:29.329
So the magnetic field is
going up and up and up.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:33.066
This is good. This is what we want
when you compress magnetic field.

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.468
But then again you see
all those oscillations,

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:38.171
both on the outside sensor
and the inside sensor

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.073
and then the plasma crash,

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:41.141
like it-it dies here.

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:43.944
What we want it to do is
to go up, up, up, up, up,

01:01:43.968 --> 01:01:45.979
probably to about
this height here.

01:01:52.777 --> 01:01:56.823
So, we're clamping
it now, um, Claude,

01:01:56.847 --> 01:01:59.259
so stop flowing. Stop flowing!

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:01.886
- Okay!
- Okay.

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:04.865
This is always a
stressful event,

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:06.332
because if we let air
into the chamber,

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:09.069
it's filled with moisture, and it
will ruin the quality of our vacuum.

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:10.895
It will take weeks and
weeks to recover.

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:14.999
Ooh, gosh.

01:02:23.507 --> 01:02:26.286
All right, go on, cut
the flow in... now.

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:28.254
Cut it now.

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:30.123
Very good. Thanks.

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:30.991
We did it.

01:02:31.015 --> 01:02:32.993
Five years ago when
we were staring up

01:02:33.017 --> 01:02:34.460
and building our first machines,

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.029
we were having things
blow up every day.

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:38.398
It was... People were scared.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.224
The siren really made
people frightened.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.206
There's no point building
the wrong thing though.

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:49.109
I got it. Yeah, absolutely.
I know. I know.

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:51.878
But the flip side of that
is that that can go on

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:53.914
- for a while, right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:56.817
I know you got a good handle
on it, but just I gotta ask.

01:02:56.841 --> 01:03:00.020
But-But I'm not against
actually restarting our...

01:03:00.044 --> 01:03:02.022
I... well...

01:03:02.046 --> 01:03:05.525
Because in my opinion, we should
try all the available targets.

01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:07.493
- Got it. However...
- Because you don't know

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:08.962
what the hell would work or not.

01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:10.396
It it decided that we
have a pot of work,

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.366
and we're trying to fill... we're
trying to put people in those pots.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:16.369
No, no, no. We don't have enough
people to fill in those pots,

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:19.172
so we wanted to get people
to put into those pots

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:20.874
but what we have done...

01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:23.443
- is make an extra pot.
- Is made a new pot.

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:26.446
- Be careful of that.
- Yes, I understand the problem.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:29.449
Good.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.051
I-I like... I'm a,

01:03:31.075 --> 01:03:33.586
I'm a practical physicist,

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:34.720
an experimental physicist.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:37.858
It is true that at work I
don't do the work anymore.

01:03:37.882 --> 01:03:40.093
Now, all my guy do the
work, and we just...

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:42.295
I push paper and answer emails.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:46.066
Sometime I go into the lab and turn
some screws just because I like it.

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:48.368
But yeah, this is one of
the hobby that I have.

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:57.610
I put my hat. That's
my mother hat.

01:03:57.634 --> 01:03:58.634
She knitted this one.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:03.974
Oh, long time ago. Must
be at least 30 years.

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:06.176
She passed away now.

01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:09.146
She won't knit me a new one.

01:04:59.964 --> 01:05:01.507
My name is Mark Uhran.

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:04.444
I was previously the director

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.412
of the International
Space Station division

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:09.582
at NASA headquarters,
and I spent 28 years

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:11.584
working on the space
station program,

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:14.687
and I now work for
the US ITER project.

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:19.159
What struck me the strongest
from the very first year

01:05:19.183 --> 01:05:20.626
as I began to meet the people

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.662
that were engaged
around the world

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:24.164
was how much this was like

01:05:24.188 --> 01:05:26.699
the International Space
Station program.

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:30.370
Uh, ITER, when I joined,
was right around the end

01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:33.173
of their final design phase.

01:05:33.197 --> 01:05:35.308
And today they're on the cusp

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:38.444
between final design
and construction.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.580
And the space station program

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:43.616
toward the end of the
final design phase

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.119
was really quite chaotic.

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:50.123
Uh, they had not yet
reached a point

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:53.193
where the
decision-making process

01:05:53.217 --> 01:05:55.095
was being done

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:58.498
in accordance with practices
of systems engineering.

01:05:58.522 --> 01:06:00.700
It took two to three years

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:02.335
to accomplish that turnaround,

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:07.140
because this was a project
that spanned five partners

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:09.775
and involved on the order of
five to ten thousand people

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:11.144
around the world.

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:13.413
Oh, it's like trying
to change the course

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:15.148
on a supertanker.

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:17.217
So when I joined
ITER four years ago,

01:06:17.241 --> 01:06:20.053
the process was
similarly chaotic

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:22.222
and certainly in need of

01:06:22.246 --> 01:06:25.658
a regimented and disciplined
systems engineering approach.

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:28.228
And over the past four years,

01:06:28.252 --> 01:06:30.487
I've seen progress
in that direction.

01:06:32.056 --> 01:06:35.601
This-This is a real test

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:36.636
of human civilization.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:40.364
And it's a test that we
can't afford to fail.

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:46.170
We have to prove that we
have the intelligence...

01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:48.572
to prevent our own extinction.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:25.938
To be able to work on
fusion, I think is for me

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:27.640
is a dream come true,

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:28.941
but it's not just us.

01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:30.443
It's actually you guys as well,

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.612
because your support,
or your taxes,

01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:34.647
are putting force to this,

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.283
to the dawn of the fusion age.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:40.286
And so, to a large extent,
I thank you guys,

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:42.287
one, for your
curiosity in coming,

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:44.424
but also for your
support for fusion.

01:09:44.448 --> 01:09:46.683
So, thank you.

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:50.395
- I'm Chuck Flanigan.
- Hi, Chuck.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.331
Hi.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.966
Back during the
engineering design phase,

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.369
I was the deputy manager
for the US team.

01:09:56.393 --> 01:09:58.504
- Oh, fantastic!
- That was a long time ago.

01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:01.407
I've been retired
since 95, so...

01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:03.576
The Munich television
people come out.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.279
They wanted to know, "How can
you be working on something

01:10:06.303 --> 01:10:08.681
that's going to last 50
years into the future?"

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:11.584
And Ken said, "Have you ever
been into the cathedral?"

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:12.918
Yeah, exactly.

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.687
Those people never saw
the final product.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.423
-No, no, they passed away,
but they also... -Good job.

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:20.426
- People like Spitzer, same way.
- Yeah. Right. Exactly.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.861
- Thank you. Also thank you...
- Yeah, thanks.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:25.355
For laying the foundation in the
road to get to where we are today.

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:32.705
I came on February 14, 19...
Uh, 2008.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:36.342
I left CRPP Lausanne,
Switzerland one day

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:38.286
and showed up here the
next day to start working.

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:41.881
This is cool.

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.373
I get to go on-site.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:48.988
I've never gone
beyond this point.

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:50.490
This is like Frodo, you know.

01:10:50.514 --> 01:10:52.358
I've never been... This
is like, you know,

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:53.759
a first step on the site.

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:55.385
This is cool, isn't it?

01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:01.825
Go this way?

01:11:05.529 --> 01:11:07.373
I look at this and I see...

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:10.510
what is gonna happen
in five, ten years.

01:11:10.534 --> 01:11:13.078
So even though I haven't
been down there,

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.339
I know what it is in my brain.

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:23.956
I can see the vessel.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.825
I can see inside the vessel.

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:28.828
I can see everything, but I
can't see the plasma side.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:31.788
That one, that one I'm
looking forward to seeing.

01:11:33.557 --> 01:11:34.334
Okay?

01:11:34.358 --> 01:11:36.436
Let's go. I wanna
get down there.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:37.694
You guys are holding me back.

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:43.700
This is pretty cool, when you
think also that we're, uh...

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.437
gonna be about 30
meters underground.

01:11:48.104 --> 01:11:49.949
It's weird to be here.

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:53.619
And to think that in about...

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:54.787
ten years' time, there's
going to be about

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:58.424
100 million degrees Celsius above...
sitting above us.

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:01.427
And another four and a half
meters up is the level 1,

01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:04.029
the ground floor... launchers.

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:05.898
The next level up, level 2,

01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:07.567
the diagnostics, the
heating systems,

01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:09.935
the ion cyclotron,
electron cyclotron.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:11.737
It's all there.

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.330
Just give it some time.
It will come.

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:25.064
I think that ITER
will probably work,

01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:28.801
and it will demonstrate
that fusion is doable.

01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:31.637
I think that as a project
it's very difficult

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:32.805
because it's international,

01:15:32.829 --> 01:15:36.175
so there's all sort of project
management issue there.

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.677
So they're gonna
blow their budget

01:15:37.701 --> 01:15:39.869
and their schedule big time.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:50.189
It's just become such a
Tower of Babel in there,

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:54.226
it will burn money at twice the
rate that you need to do it.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:56.228
But we'll, we'll
plow through it.

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.964
It will get built,
and it will work.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:01.266
And this will, in my
opinion, give a big shot

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:03.268
in the arm of fusion
because here is a machine

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:04.804
that showed it can be done.

01:16:04.828 --> 01:16:07.039
However, as a power plant,

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:08.741
I don't think it's
very practical.

01:16:08.765 --> 01:16:10.643
It's a machine
that's very complex,

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.077
very expensive,

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:14.880
a little unreliable, there's
those disruption in there

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:16.882
that happen that can
damage the machine.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:19.351
It's-It's difficult to conceive

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:21.654
that such a machine
can become a reliable

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.155
day-to-day power plant.

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.626
But, you know, it's-it's like
the Wright brothers, you know.

01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:28.694
Like that plane didn't have
to take a 100 passengers

01:16:28.718 --> 01:16:29.795
across the Atlantic,

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:33.165
but it evolved when somebody
showed that you can fly.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:35.901
After that, lots of
investment and money goes in.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.103
After that, the excitement
in fusion will go up,

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:39.071
because right now,

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:41.373
there's not much
excitement about fusion.

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:44.176
If you look at the
alternative energy concept,

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.845
you ever hear about fusion?

01:16:45.869 --> 01:16:49.982
Ah, windmill, solar, tide,
chicken shit, whatever,

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:51.675
but never fusion.

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:54.286
Uh, this is the
Port Mann Bridge.

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:55.688
It's brand new actually.

01:16:55.712 --> 01:16:57.389
It's one of those
cable-stayed ones.

01:16:57.413 --> 01:16:59.158
It's actually quite nice.

01:16:59.182 --> 01:17:02.786
A billion dollar... to
build such a thing.

all the fossil fuel

01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:15.031
and the pollution and
the global warming.
