00:01.084 --> 00:03.178
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor:</i>

00:03.337 --> 00:06.887
After three years of crazy,
I think we deserve one drink.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.184
Is divorce sex a thing?

00:09.301 --> 00:11.429
I didn't come to play backup to Wall.

00:11.595 --> 00:14.144
I came to take over.
It's him or me, Jelena.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.440
Anyone angry with his brother
is subject to judgment.

00:18.602 --> 00:22.106
- Shut your mouth.
- Be careful, or I deal with blowback.

00:22.272 --> 00:25.025
Jude, you and I came into this
with a plan. Trust it.

00:25.192 --> 00:28.787
You've had your fun coming at me.
Then you came at my mother.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.623
- I'm coming for you.
- Olivia had something on me.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.960
I came into this country illegally.
I never got papers.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.712
- We're gonna take Oscar down.
- Take Oscar down?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.924
I don't think my father
would like that very much.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.854
- Why are you targeting Oscar?
- Targeting?

01:02.020 --> 01:03.943
Jude, you're being dramatic.

01:05.649 --> 01:09.574
"We're still going to take Oscar down"
is just cocktail party conversation.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.329
Jude, right?

01:11.488 --> 01:14.082
I don't know what it is
you think you heard, but--

01:14.241 --> 01:18.417
I'm not doing this, I don't have to.
If you don't tell me, you can tell Oscar

01:18.579 --> 01:21.628
including that bit about
being in the country illegally.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.548
I think he's in his office right now.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.555
Fraud.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.184
We're investigating him for fraud.

01:34.344 --> 01:38.190
The new Hollywood Arena
is being built with dirty money

01:38.307 --> 01:40.810
and we've been looking into it.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.530
You're the dance director,
and you run the bar.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.065
What's it to you?

01:47.107 --> 01:50.907
The Devils doesn't just belong to him.
This is our home too.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.326
What proof do you have?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.417
Nothing yet.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.629
And we don't wanna lose
our jobs over it.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.792
Look, if we can forget it,
can you not say anything to Oscar?

02:05.459 --> 02:08.303
Of course not. Are you insane?
He's my father.

02:08.419 --> 02:12.470
- Who wasn't much of a father to you.
- That's one way of looking at it.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.263
The wrong way. It doesn't matter.
That's changing.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.266
You're not overwhelmed
with Devils pride.

02:20.599 --> 02:25.025
You're not forgetting anything. You have
something on Oscar, but not enough.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.655
- Not yet.
- Jude--

02:27.814 --> 02:31.284
You're not going to the cops.
You'll give what you have to me.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.286
Why? You'd just give it to Oscar.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.449
If you do,
you might just lose your job.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.661
If you don't, someone might be
deported and lose their kid.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.210
I was wrong. You are your father.

02:45.749 --> 02:49.379
- What's it gonna be?
- There's still a few things coming in.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.222
Gather it up.
And not a word to anyone

02:52.381 --> 02:54.475
or I start making phone calls.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.319
- We're here.
- Thank you.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.410
Hey, coach.
I tried calling you last night.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.204
- Missed you at the dinner.
- I wasn't able to...

03:24.371 --> 03:29.252
I had an emergency. He helped me out.
He's a star, this one.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.672
- Making sure everything's all right.
- Yep.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.430
Guess I better get inside.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.433
See you at the game?

03:46.601 --> 03:48.194
Wouldn't miss it.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.411
There you are.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.706
I assume you're headed
to the team breakfast too?

03:59.823 --> 04:01.245
I am.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.958
I don't have to say
that I'm still waiting for your answer.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.918
I don't have to say I don't rush.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.175
No, you're smart.
You weigh your options carefully,

04:10.333 --> 04:14.133
even when the choice, Terrence
or me, seems painfully obvious.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.053
Let me help speed things along.

04:17.214 --> 04:20.970
Recently, I found myself at the hub
of a whole bunch of key Devil plays.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.806
What's your point?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.895
My point is,

04:26.057 --> 04:30.563
if I wanted to, I could make playoffs
go in a really bad direction.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.657
I already have a championship ring.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.861
I could get over the loss.
Would Terrence?

04:38.195 --> 04:40.072
You'd throw an entire season?

04:40.238 --> 04:44.744
I know this sounds like hardball,
but really, it's flirtation.

04:44.910 --> 04:48.289
The Jelena Howard I know
gets off on a good power move.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.343
Telling Jude
there's things coming in

04:57.464 --> 04:59.967
bought us time,
but he's not gonna wait forever.

05:00.133 --> 05:04.388
What would we even give him?
Random numbers, random names?

05:04.554 --> 05:08.934
- We haven't been able to tie it together.
- And if we hand it over, we never will.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.068
I noticed you didn't tell him
about Mia.

05:15.065 --> 05:18.319
If I told him we were trying to
connect Oscar to Mia's death

05:18.485 --> 05:21.113
we'd be sitting
in Oscar's office right now.

05:21.404 --> 05:25.034
We need to find something in Oscar's
records that makes a connection.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.918
And fast.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.249
Hey, Ahsh.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.758
<i>Hey-</i>

05:36.419 --> 05:38.763
- What?
- Pete missed a dinner last night.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.300
A big one. No call, no nothing.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.053
Thanks.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.688
Three games.

05:51.393 --> 05:55.273
Three games separate
the top five teams in the West.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.607
At stake in today's game,

05:57.774 --> 06:01.369
home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs.

06:01.528 --> 06:05.658
We have some ground to make up after
those losses after the all-star break.

06:06.074 --> 06:10.170
I can't remember how many points
I scored with my first championship,

06:10.328 --> 06:15.835
how many assists.
What I do remember are my teammates.

06:16.001 --> 06:22.475
If you can buy in to the team,
if you can trust each other, we'll win.

06:22.632 --> 06:26.262
And that's what you'll remember.
And that's how they'll remember you.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.941
I'll remember how my team
cut me out of the plays.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.444
Now, you guys have 13 losses
all season here at home.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.080
- Thirteen. Our house.
- Something going on?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.832
- Sorry. No, nothing.
- With the Devils' sixth man

06:47.991 --> 06:50.119
- Everything's fine.
- cheering you on,

06:50.577 --> 06:52.955
that makes the job
a whole lot easier.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.015
- Hey.
- Ahsha, hey.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.597
How are you doing?
We haven't talked since...

07:07.218 --> 07:11.314
Right. Yeah, listen, I'm really sorry
about that scene in my office.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.692
I know how that must have looked.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.108
I was in a really crappy place.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.617
- "Was"?
- I'm better now.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.904
But thank you for staying with me.
That was...

07:25.070 --> 07:27.289
Well, thank you.

07:36.206 --> 07:39.176
Can I catch up to you?
There's someone I have to talk to.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.631
Sure.

07:54.307 --> 07:58.437
"Up the Rear"?
"Epic Saddlebag, Silky Summit"?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.697
Sound more like
porn titles than horses.

08:01.022 --> 08:04.902
Why don't you just choose them all?
That's what I do. $1000 on each horse.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.321
You don't understand
how betting works.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.742
You can never have enough people
eating their hearts out when you win.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.664
Two thousand on each horse.
He's buying.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.208
Kyle?

08:19.916 --> 08:24.888
- Donny. What are you doing here?
- Horrible gambling problem.

08:25.046 --> 08:28.721
Brett, make sure you have her back
in time for our date later.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.682
- Your date with Kyle?
- No, my date with you.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.438
Yes, with Kyle, of course.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.224
Oh, so that's why
I couldn't take you to dinner.

08:36.390 --> 08:40.395
I had a rough time scheduling my date
around Andrew's dinner too so...

08:40.562 --> 08:42.860
- All of you know each other?
- We're rich.

08:42.981 --> 08:47.111
I am not much of a dater. Crazy how
I'd cross paths with three people--

08:47.277 --> 08:49.746
Andrew has one hotel,
he's out of his league.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.242
- You've got no hotels.
- An airline trumps your little website.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.163
- Who invests in the Internet?
- Who goes on a date at a race track?

08:57.328 --> 09:00.707
Actually, we've been burning
through cash like nobody's business.

09:00.874 --> 09:04.629
- It's kind of hot.
- You want to burn through cash, Kyle?

09:04.794 --> 09:08.640
- Excuse me, our date isn't over.
- I don't think it ever began.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.348
- Where'd you get that suit?
- Where'd you get that accent?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.815
Come on in.

09:23.521 --> 09:28.277
- Hi. Do you have a second?
- Yeah, of course. Everything okay?

09:29.152 --> 09:32.747
I didn't want to make
a big scene at breakfast.

09:32.864 --> 09:36.459
The other morning in your office
wasn't a one-time thing.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.960
You missed practise.
You missed a coach's dinner.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.383
German told you.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.045
Ahsha, you shouldn't read
too much into what other people say.

09:47.212 --> 09:51.058
When you hugged me at breakfast,
I could smell alcohol on your breath.

09:54.094 --> 09:58.520
My mom may have stuck around
when you were drinking, but I won't.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.352
I didn't know you existed
for <i>22</i> years of my life

10:02.519 --> 10:04.772
partially because of your drinking,

10:04.938 --> 10:08.442
and I'll go another <i>22</i> years
without you if it continues.

10:09.818 --> 10:13.413
It's your choice. Me or alcohol.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.408
Ahsha, you're really

10:16.574 --> 10:18.292
worried about nothing.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.954
But if you feel that strongly,

10:21.538 --> 10:23.131
of course I choose you.

10:38.596 --> 10:44.069
- Have you taken me down yet?
- I was pissed. Still am.

10:44.227 --> 10:47.481
But I don't have any Jelena in me.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.066
Finally.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.865
Something we can both agree on.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.491
Looks like you're Care Bear after all.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.456
No, I'm still going for her.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.622
I've had a front-row seat
in the game of backstabbing.

11:03.746 --> 11:08.923
I know the steps.
Step one: Disarm the victim.

11:09.085 --> 11:12.680
Step two: Identify their weakness.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.302
Step three: Exploit it.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.976
Step four: Lean back and enjoy.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.616
L.A. 113, Indiana 114,
19 seconds left in the fourth quarter.

13:41.195 --> 13:44.039
Devils bring the ball up,
pass to Wall.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.748
Sees Zero calling for the ball.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.414
Time's running out,
three seconds left.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.886
Zero spins, he shoots, he makes it!

13:57.045 --> 13:58.888
- Wait, the refs wave it off.
- What?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.466
The shot went off after the buzzer.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.269
Come on. What was that?
Are you kidding me?

14:05.428 --> 14:07.806
It was close. No way.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.485
Game of seconds, huh?
Hesitate too long,

14:17.523 --> 14:19.025
youlose.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.428
I didn't want to start
our playoff run on the road.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.595
I don't want to go home.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.476
Not alone.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.811
Let's get out of here.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.448
You're panicking.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.789
You're panicking,
and it's at the worst possible time.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.080
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:13.246 --> 15:17.547
What happened with your girl?
You're spun out, bro.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.962
You keep thinking I'll let you down,
but I'm still right here.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.722
I never left.

15:27.468 --> 15:31.598
If we're gonna win this thing,
you're gonna need to trust me.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.815
You'll get it. Relax.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.617
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

15:44.235 --> 15:45.703
A little rent disagreement.

15:45.820 --> 15:49.745
My landlord thinks he's getting it
by the end of the day, and I disagree.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.377
Delicious.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.664
Champagne tastes better
on my private jet.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.128
- I'm listening.
- Oh, the places you'll go.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.966
I can do you here. I can do you there.
I can do you everywhere.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.468
You sound like a filthy Dr. Seuss.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.514
I hate to interrupt what is
the one laugh of your evening,

16:09.677 --> 16:12.647
- but our table is ready.
- I thought drinks were later.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.853
You said 8:00.

16:15.016 --> 16:19.396
If you two clowns will excuse us, Kyle
and I have a private concert to attend to.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.109
Brett, our date is tomorrow.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.571
No, you specifically said tonight,
and to meet you here.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.613
I did? I am so embarrassed.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.000
You're playing us
against each other for trinkets.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.333
- What? Never.
- No, no, no. I respect that.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.090
Okay, good.
That's exactly what I'm doing.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.501
I have the cash
to keep this going forever.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.512
But not the patience. So we do this:

16:44.670 --> 16:47.469
We meet tomorrow and present Kyle
with our best offer.

16:48.049 --> 16:51.895
Whoever she determines
gives the best gift gets bragging rights.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.350
- I'm in.
- You're on.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.399
Could I get another drink?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.104
- On me.
- This one's on me.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.734
Raquel.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.941
- We're working on it.
- I know.

17:47.108 --> 17:50.783
Listen, I was thinking.
You're in a tough spot, being illegal.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.156
I'm not illegal, I'm undocumented.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.165
Whatever.
It's got to be bad for you

17:55.324 --> 17:58.043
or Olivia wouldn't threaten you
with that letter.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.175
- So, what?
- I can protect you.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.257
Make sure Oscar only hears
Sloane's name.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.306
Why would you do that?

18:10.756 --> 18:14.477
Let's just say I have a soft spot
for single moms with young sons.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.268
I don't want to risk
separating you if I don't have to.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.398
I don't trust Sloane
will give me everything

18:22.560 --> 18:25.404
but you can make sure she does.
But you have to.

18:25.563 --> 18:30.160
Get every last bit to me, and you won't
have to worry about Miguel again.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.963
Callie Malina? She's the queen
of the L.A. meat market.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.299
You want a high-class girl,
she will rent you the best.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.548
The most important thing
to Jelena is her image.

18:52.715 --> 18:56.436
That's what I'm gonna take from her.
Just like she went after my mom's.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.896
I don't know
what business Jelena has,

18:59.055 --> 19:02.776
or why she appreciates her discretion,
and I don't care.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.436
Putting their names together
would hurt her.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.447
It would show the world
what a phoney she really is.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.028
What are you gonna do?

19:10.191 --> 19:12.694
Forward this to the L.A. Times.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.409
They'll know it came from you.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.247
Not if I send it from
a dummy e-mail account. See?

19:26.040 --> 19:29.169
Some things you do in anger
you can never take back.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.426
Once you hit "send,"
there's no undoing it.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.808
Exactly.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.398
- I got your message.
- Jude came to me.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.362
He offered me a deal.

19:52.525 --> 19:57.326
He said he'd only give you up if
I made sure he got everything we had.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.957
Well, that would be
an easy deal to take.

20:00.116 --> 20:03.746
I'm not taking it. I'm telling you this
because he brought up Olivia

20:03.911 --> 20:06.539
and how she was
blackmailing me with a letter.

20:06.664 --> 20:10.385
- He overheard us, we know that.
- I never said it was a letter.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.845
The only reason
he'd assume it was a letter--

20:13.003 --> 20:14.676
ls if he got one too.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.392
Jude's got his own secret.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.104
And we need to find out what it is.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.613
- Another Porsche?
- Nope.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.990
This one's yours.

20:37.153 --> 20:40.828
I thought you'd like the colour,
dark and tortured, just like you.

20:43.242 --> 20:48.123
Had a conversation with the agency,
talked to the partners. Made it official.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.463
My agent doesn't
tool around in a crap box.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.263
- Your agent?
- Goodbye junior agent,

20:56.380 --> 20:58.758
hello my main number-one guy.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.228
I don't... I don't know what to say.

21:10.561 --> 21:14.941
I'd never be here in L.A. with
the world at my feet if it wasn't for you.

21:15.149 --> 21:18.403
- Are you still Team Zero?
- Abso-freaking-lutely.

21:18.569 --> 21:19.912
Good.

21:20.070 --> 21:23.040
Now, drive me to the arena,
you lazy bitch.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.910
Raquel. Jude's done waiting.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.171
<i>I have to meet at the arena.
I don't know what to give him.</i>

22:10.329 --> 22:13.549
- Found something. I'm in his apartment.
- You're in his--?

22:14.416 --> 22:16.544
- What'd you find?
- A red envelope

22:16.710 --> 22:18.257
like the one Olivia sent me

22:18.420 --> 22:21.344
except his has a phone number in it,
with an extension.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.635
- <i>Whose?</i>
- I didn't recognise the number

22:23.801 --> 22:25.269
but I recognised the guy.

22:25.386 --> 22:28.139
He used to hang around Jesse.
He's a coke dealer.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.982
- If you find any--
- <i>I</i> looked.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.313
So far I haven't found anything.

22:32.476 --> 22:37.733
The dealer doesn't have a phone tree,
so I don't know what the pound-22's for.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.902
<i>Maybe this is enough
for Jude to back off.</i>

22:42.945 --> 22:44.572
I gotta go.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.999
Many people wanna know
what happened.

22:54.164 --> 22:58.169
- The e-mail. You confirm or deny it?
- Need some type of statement here.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.470
- Excuse me, Zero.
- Verify what you've said.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.227
Madam Callie Malina
didn't supply you with girls?

23:07.344 --> 23:10.314
- Where is this coming from?
- E-mail linked you to her.

23:10.472 --> 23:14.067
- When we showed it to her--
- I don't care what she or anyone says.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.278
- It's a mistake.
- Your sponsors react?

23:16.437 --> 23:19.281
There's nothing to react to.
Hand to God.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.317
What will you say to people
who say

23:21.483 --> 23:24.327
your Christian lifestyle
is a calculated lie?

23:24.486 --> 23:25.954
'ZZZ

23:30.284 --> 23:33.458
<i>The scandal broke
thanks to an anonymous e-mail.</i>

23:33.621 --> 23:37.501
Oh, I knew there was more to that dude
than hallelujahs and holy water.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.925
Now everyone else does too.
It is hysterical.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.473
I'm glad you feel that way.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.680
<i>- Hand to God.
- Derek.</i>

23:48.552 --> 23:50.225
I did something.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.099
What did you do?

23:57.019 --> 24:00.398
<i>- What's your answer?
- I don't have an answer.</i>

24:01.023 --> 24:03.651
You're the anonymous e-mail?
Are you serious?

24:03.817 --> 24:07.663
- I was aiming for Jelena. I missed.
- Wait, aiming for her?

24:07.947 --> 24:10.370
She had an e-mail
to the woman in her stuff.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.330
Ahsha, what are you doing?

24:12.493 --> 24:14.416
Jelena's came after me
since day one.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.956
And then she went after my mother.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.966
What?
The look you're giving me, what?

24:20.417 --> 24:22.044
It's just--

24:22.795 --> 24:26.015
This isn't you. It's her.

24:26.173 --> 24:30.019
I'm not Jelena.
I never meant for this to happen.

24:31.762 --> 24:33.730
It's a reporter. I gotta take this.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.766
- Derek.
- Hello.

24:35.933 --> 24:40.154
Extra <i>got this exclusive interview
with girlfriend Jelena Howard.</i>

24:40.312 --> 24:43.065
<i>You found out your boyfriend
sleeps with prostitutes.</i>

24:43.232 --> 24:45.200
<i>How does that make you feel?</i>

24:46.026 --> 24:49.656
<i>I feel awful. For him and for me.</i>

24:49.989 --> 24:54.335
Awful he had to do it and awful
I had to learn about it this way.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.962
How did you find out about it?

24:57.746 --> 25:01.171
I found Callie Malina's e-mail address
with Zero's things

25:01.792 --> 25:05.387
and I sent her what I thought was
a private e-mail last week

25:05.504 --> 25:09.134
looking for clarity,
and then this happened.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.431
What would you like to say to him?

25:11.969 --> 25:15.599
I'm not going to pass judgment on him
or attack him.

25:15.764 --> 25:19.109
Enough has been said,
and that's just not my style.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.321
I will say I'm hurt.

25:22.771 --> 25:27.402
Men who have power
think they can do whatever they want.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.947
But there is some behaviour
you cannot put up with.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.374
If that means I have to be alone,
so be it.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.870
You're so strong.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.831
How do you think
your e-mail got leaked?

25:40.998 --> 25:42.966
I don't know.

25:43.125 --> 25:46.550
And I can't imagine
what their agenda could be,

25:47.254 --> 25:50.133
but they obviously have a dark soul.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.180
<i>I'll pray for them.</i>

26:01.101 --> 26:04.480
I understand that, Oscar,
but Zero's problem is personal.

26:04.646 --> 26:07.741
I'm a coach, not a publicist.
I'm staying out of it.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.364
Okay.

26:18.327 --> 26:22.173
Why did we never do this before?
Just hang out, have fun?

26:23.916 --> 26:26.465
- You were always away.
- So were you.

26:27.836 --> 26:31.431
We spent more time on our careers
than we did on each other.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.183
On each other.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.852
You know what I meant.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.857
Well, maybe we can fix that.
Why don't you come with me?

26:41.725 --> 26:45.730
First playoff game's on the road.
Might be nice to have some company.

26:45.896 --> 26:49.366
- Do you want me to go with you?
- Would that be such a bad thing?

26:51.110 --> 26:52.862
Oh, we didn't order that.

26:53.695 --> 26:54.992
They did.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.449
- They're big fans.
- Of...?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.123
Ms. Davenport.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.796
Of course.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.048
Oh, Iwin.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.637
I told Ahsha I was not gonna drink.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.843
Okay. More for me, then.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.722
It's just champagne, though, right?

27:19.263 --> 27:20.856
Yeah.

27:21.014 --> 27:25.144
- Here's to hanging out and having fun.
- Cheers.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.687
Cheers.

27:32.901 --> 27:38.829
It's a Zac Posen that Zac Posen
hasn't even seen yet.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.253
Your move.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.878
That's cute. That's cute.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.419
Milady.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.883
- Is this real?
- What do you think?

28:00.304 --> 28:03.057
Donny, I don't know, darling.
What have you got?

28:03.849 --> 28:07.399
- It doesn't exactly fit in a box.
- Don't tell me it's love.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.814
You tell me. You're standing in it.

28:09.980 --> 28:13.405
This apartment. You own it.
I bought it for you.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.242
- Don't have to worry about rent.
- You've got to be kidding.

28:17.404 --> 28:21.375
- In addition to the dress, I've g0t--
- No. It was final and best.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.628
Kyle? Do we have a winner?

28:24.745 --> 28:27.089
That's what I thought. Pay up, boys.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.716
Wait, Donny, don't you
wanna celebrate with me?

28:29.875 --> 28:34.301
Next time. They're taking me to the
Polo Lounge so I can drink their tears.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.930
- It's about time you won one.
- Let's roll.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.115
I think we did meet your
biggest fans, no doubt about it.

28:53.273 --> 28:56.402
They knew every single line
from every movie you've done

28:56.860 --> 28:58.828
and I remember everything.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.793
I know how this looks, but don't worry.

29:11.959 --> 29:15.384
My PR team, they're getting in front
of this whole thing.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.178
So what, people know
that the God thing was an act?

29:19.341 --> 29:21.014
I'll get them back.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.646
People love a reformed sinner
if you cry hard enough.

29:24.805 --> 29:27.308
If that doesn't work,
win a championship.

29:28.016 --> 29:31.395
People forget. I'll be fine.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.405
We'll be fine.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.323
I don't know.

29:35.941 --> 29:39.821
That was pretty devastating.
I'm not sure you'll ever recover.

29:45.242 --> 29:46.619
You set me up.

29:48.328 --> 29:51.582
You asked me to choose. I chose.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.380
You didn't even know
if Terrence was an option.

29:58.964 --> 30:03.014
I'd rather have a 5 percent chance with
him than 100 percent chance with you.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.277
Looks like you'll be needing
that championship after all.

30:29.369 --> 30:32.248
Have the car ready in five. Thanks.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.505
I have a few things to pack.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.220
I'll meet you at the plane,
Mr. Davenport.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.048
You have what I want?

31:16.375 --> 31:17.672
I have something.

31:22.005 --> 31:25.475
- I went out of my way for you.
- I went out of my way for you.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.433
Over to Studio City,
through your living room window.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.602
You broke into my apartment?

31:30.764 --> 31:34.735
Would you have given me your coke
dealer's number if I asked you nicely?

31:36.228 --> 31:39.858
- I don't do coke.
- I believe you, actually.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.951
Olivia was blackmailing you
like she was blackmailing me.

31:43.110 --> 31:47.365
The coke dealer was half of it
and we both know the other half.

31:47.531 --> 31:50.660
How do you think Oscar would feel
knowing you brought that

31:50.784 --> 31:54.789
into his house?
Into the Devils' locker room?

31:55.247 --> 31:59.047
What's more important to you,
protecting Oscar or saving yourself?

32:02.087 --> 32:04.340
Not gonna let you
keep investigating Oscar.

32:04.464 --> 32:07.559
And we're not gonna let you
hang us out to dry with him.

32:07.717 --> 32:11.142
Fine. You back off, I back off.

32:11.763 --> 32:15.643
No Oscar, no cops.
No call to Immigration.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.158
Deal.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.620
Let's hope no one does
anything stupid.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.576
Let's hope.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.379
- We're backing off?
- Of course not.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.420
Which player is Jude dealing to?

32:44.087 --> 32:45.760
Pound-22.

32:47.048 --> 32:50.018
Number 22.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.142
Derek Roman.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.657
What are you doing here?

33:05.525 --> 33:07.573
I didn't want
that conversation we had

33:07.736 --> 33:10.990
to be the last conversation we had
before you left.

33:11.156 --> 33:14.126
It was weird.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.504
You feel weird about what you did?

33:17.871 --> 33:19.589
I'm not Jelena.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.970
- I don't want to be.
- You're not. You just gotta be careful.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.185
- I love you.
- I love you too.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.068
I saw the interview.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.032
It's crazy how
all of that stuff came out.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.701
Yeah, crazy.

33:57.077 --> 33:59.830
I didn't come here
to talk to you about that.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.416
I came to warn you.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.343
Watch your back with Zero.

34:10.005 --> 34:12.759
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.183
<i>Hey-</i>

34:21.518 --> 34:23.235
I'm sorry.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.148
We've been in this thing together
from the jump

34:26.815 --> 34:29.284
and I should have never
stopped trusting you.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.864
Welcome back.

34:43.665 --> 34:47.795
The flat tyre was impressive.
Did you wear a do-rag when you did it?

34:47.960 --> 34:52.011
- I knew you set me up.
- I knew you'd make it easy.

34:52.172 --> 34:54.801
All it took to light your fuse
was a poke at mom.

34:54.967 --> 34:58.268
That picture at the roast
wasn't about hurting my mother.

34:58.430 --> 35:02.025
- It was about setting me off.
- It couldn't have been more obvious.

35:02.142 --> 35:05.021
I might as well have
signed my name on that photo.

35:05.145 --> 35:08.866
You got so mad.
And you thought you were so clever.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.326
Ahsha's revenge.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.788
All you did was make people
love me more.

35:14.904 --> 35:17.578
Well, that and ruin a man's life.

35:17.824 --> 35:22.455
I'm not proud of what I did, but
I'm not going to let it mess with me.

35:22.621 --> 35:26.216
You think this was just
a game of psychological warfare?

35:26.625 --> 35:29.549
To get you down on yourself?

35:29.711 --> 35:32.385
I don't care if you can sleep at night.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.968
Then what was the point?

35:38.303 --> 35:41.557
It doesn't matter
what you change your e-mail to.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.397
Your IP address
will always give you away.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.114
You want what I have,

35:49.898 --> 35:52.822
but you can only get it
doing what I do.

35:53.193 --> 35:54.740
And I'll always do it better.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.206
If what happened to Zero was brutal

35:58.365 --> 36:03.417
wait till you see what happens to you
when everyone finds out what you did.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.921
Ahsha. I need to talk to you.

36:16.466 --> 36:20.767
Pete's still not here, his driver's been
driving around his place the past hour.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.681
He's not answering his phone.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.479
I'll go get him.

36:41.700 --> 36:46.627
She took my reputation,
all my sponsors.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.378
I'll figure something out. I'll fix it.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.760
It's beyond fixing.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.845
I've lost everything.

36:54.754 --> 36:58.008
Listen to me. Listen to me.

36:58.174 --> 37:02.304
I was Team Zero before,
and I'm Team Zero now.

37:02.470 --> 37:06.145
We're in this together, okay?
I would never leave you.

37:06.307 --> 37:08.105
No, you wouldn't.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.778
You never have.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.450
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Jude.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.781
Jude.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.541
Thank you.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.295
Pete.

37:35.003 --> 37:38.098
Pete. The plane's going to
leave without you.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.805
You need to get up
and get to the airport.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.060
Pete.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.403
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor:</i>

37:52.562 --> 37:55.281
- You're gay.
- What? I'm not gay.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.783
You kissed me.

37:56.941 --> 38:00.445
Your coach must appreciate you.
A shame he missed that last game.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.989
Who are you?

38:02.155 --> 38:04.658
You know I'm the one who made
Zero's life hell.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.206
- When will everyone else know?
- You rang?

38:07.368 --> 38:10.247
- I have a job you could help me with.
- I'm listening.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.541
How many times
I ask if you were okay?

38:12.665 --> 38:16.386
German's my go-to because
he didn't throw coke in my purse.
