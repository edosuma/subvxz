00:12.480 --> 00:15.380
Now, this is why it's great
we own a sandwich shop.

00:15.520 --> 00:20.350
Everybody in the school caf
always bows down to this bad boy.

00:20.490 --> 00:22.680
Are those mashed potatoes
on a sandwich?

00:22.820 --> 00:26.220
On a bed of chicken strips
with a peanut-butter blanket.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.690
- What'd you make?
- A sandwich, not a Dumpster.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.500
Tuna fish on wheat.

00:33.770 --> 00:36.670
Tuna fish on wheat?
That's gonna be our sandwich.

00:38.410 --> 00:40.430
Do you know what our song is?

00:40.980 --> 00:45.000
- Hey, there's my girlfriend.
- That sounds like a cute song.

00:45.150 --> 00:47.110
Justin?

00:49.020 --> 00:51.040
That's a nice-looking sandwich.
What do you call it?

00:51.550 --> 00:53.850
- To the Max.
- Okay. l'll take one of those.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.410
- Well--
- Sell it, dummy.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.850
You can make another one.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.320
That'll be $80.

01:01.260 --> 01:05.290
- What?
- Okay, for senior citizens, $4.

01:08.840 --> 01:11.100
Oh, l love your family's shop.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.470
Have you ever thought of maybe
blacking out the windows

01:13.610 --> 01:17.740
and painting the walls,
l don't know, black?

01:18.680 --> 01:21.710
Yeah, l think you're gonna be easy
to shop for.

01:22.580 --> 01:26.490
He's hanging out with that goth girl,
Morticia.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.820
lt's Miranda.
Look, Harper, as your best friend,

01:29.960 --> 01:33.360
l'm gonna give it to you straight.
l think he really likes this girl.

01:33.490 --> 01:36.260
Fine, but it's so totally obvious
that he's dating her

01:36.400 --> 01:38.800
because she looks like me.

01:39.630 --> 01:42.690
Yeah, you both have faces.

01:44.170 --> 01:48.200
Max, you're gonna be late for school.
Come on, get out of here.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.040
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

01:50.180 --> 01:53.540
Hey, excuse me.
Your son made me this sandwich.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.450
Oh, l'm sorry. Look, he's only 12.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.550
No, no, no. lt's terrific.

01:58.690 --> 02:02.710
l'm Jeff Malone, concessions manager
and backup announcer for Shea Stadium.

02:02.860 --> 02:05.590
We're considering local delis to provide
the official sandwich

02:05.730 --> 02:09.630
of the New York Mets,
Mets, Mets, Mets.

02:11.370 --> 02:14.030
l think you should submit this sandwich
for consideration.

02:14.670 --> 02:16.930
Theresa, honey.
This guy is from the New York Mets,

02:17.070 --> 02:19.800
and he wants to consider us
for their official sandwich.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.400
Which sandwich?

02:21.540 --> 02:24.070
The one your son made. To the Max.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.270
- That's not really--
- A bad idea.

02:26.410 --> 02:28.440
That's not a bad idea at all.

02:28.580 --> 02:31.520
To the Max
is one of our most popular creations.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.620
- Just get Max to make one for us later.
- Okay.

02:33.750 --> 02:39.690
Great. My sandwich associates from
the New York Mets, Mets, Mets, Mets.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.090
and l will be by on Saturday
for judging.

02:42.230 --> 02:45.790
Great. Lets go Mets, Mets, Mets.

02:50.710 --> 02:54.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.880
Unbelievable.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.640
l know. Your parents are so cool.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.040
Come on, buddy,
just picture the sandwich in your mind.

04:00.170 --> 04:02.230
Yeah, Maxy.
l've seen you make it before.

04:02.380 --> 04:03.640
What do you start off with?

04:03.780 --> 04:06.410
Yeah, l don't know.
l just throw stuff together.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.420
Okay, let me think.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.020
l started with licorice.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.090
Licorice on a sandwich?

04:13.220 --> 04:16.420
No, l ate some licorice,
and then l started my sandwich.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.190
- lt had ham.
- Okay.

04:20.329 --> 04:22.630
lt had bologna, yogurt.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.090
- Yogurt?
- Yogurt?

04:24.230 --> 04:25.860
On a sandwich? That's disgusting.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.160
That's the point.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.400
l just can't remember.

04:31.540 --> 04:33.940
What are we gonna do, Jerry?
The New York Mets, Mets, Mets

04:34.070 --> 04:36.200
want the sandwich that Max made.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.740
Well, maybe we can throw a bunch
of stuff together like he does,

04:39.880 --> 04:43.750
Max can taste it, tell us what's missing,
until we find the right combination.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.380
- What do you say, Max?
- Okay. Whatever it takes to help Dad.

04:47.520 --> 04:51.460
That's the spirit, son.
Let's go. Come on, grab a bun.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.760
- Weren't you scared?
- A little.

04:57.900 --> 05:02.060
Rook to queen bishop 4 is always a risk,
but that's just how l roll.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.300
- ls your hand sweaty too?
- Yeah.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.170
l have enormous glands.

05:07.310 --> 05:09.280
l don't mind.

05:09.740 --> 05:14.700
l don't get it. Justin's so full of life
and she's so full of Halloween.

05:16.220 --> 05:19.710
l don't know, Harper, maybe
on Halloween, she'll dress up as you.

05:20.350 --> 05:22.880
She could never pull this off.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.820
l make a lot of my own clothes.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.260
Oh, which reminds me,
l need some more egg cartons.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.730
ls your hand still sweaty?

05:32.230 --> 05:34.790
Yeah. But l like it.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.670
So l'll see you tomorrow?

05:38.810 --> 05:40.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.200
Tomorrow.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.040
What--?

05:51.990 --> 05:53.210
Shaking hands?

05:53.350 --> 05:54.980
Were you saying goodbye
or closing a deal?

05:55.120 --> 05:57.350
Why didn't you kiss her?

05:57.490 --> 05:58.720
lt's none of your business.

05:58.860 --> 06:02.230
Look, Justin, you know a lot of stuff
about stuff people really don't care about,

06:02.360 --> 06:04.420
which is great,
but l know about relationships.

06:04.570 --> 06:05.900
l know how girls think.

06:06.030 --> 06:09.970
So do l. They're right-brain dominant and
they have a slightly larger hypothalamus.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.370
There you go again,
knowing stuff people don't care about.

06:13.670 --> 06:16.910
Okay, okay. l'm saying
that l'd be open to suggestions.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.070
Good, because Miranda
really wants you to kiss her.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.650
l can tell because she brightens
from tragic to just gloomy

06:21.780 --> 06:23.340
when she's around you.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.150
- So?
- So if you don't do it soon,

06:26.290 --> 06:28.050
she's gonna think
you're really not into her.

06:28.190 --> 06:30.590
Then someone's gonna have to play
chess by themselves.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.590
l already do that.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.590
You ever think of this,
Miss Smarty-Pants?

06:35.730 --> 06:37.090
Maybe l don't wanna kiss her.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.900
Okay, l'll be spreading
that rumor around.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.500
Look.

06:45.740 --> 06:48.710
Okay, l know this is gonna be hard
to believe,

06:49.410 --> 06:51.840
but l've never kissed a girl.

06:52.010 --> 06:55.880
l find it hard to believe that you think
that l find that hard to believe.

06:56.580 --> 06:57.920
Hey, l'm on it.

06:58.050 --> 07:01.540
l thought if l picked a girl that l didn't like,
that it'd be less scary.

07:01.690 --> 07:03.710
That's why l picked Miranda.

07:03.860 --> 07:06.850
Now guess what?
l like her and l'm scared again.

07:07.430 --> 07:10.090
All right, this is what we're gonna do.
First of all, take out $5.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.960
- Why?
- l need $5. Second,

07:14.470 --> 07:18.130
tomorrow, when you walk her to school,
take her by that scary, abandoned house.

07:18.270 --> 07:19.830
Right, because she'll think l'm brave.

07:19.970 --> 07:21.840
No, you'll get scared
and she'll comfort you.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.910
- That's when you plant one on her.
- Okay, that's a great idea.

07:26.050 --> 07:27.780
Thanks.
Do you have five ones for this 5?

07:29.750 --> 07:32.120
Great, because my 5 was lonely.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.950
Does anybody see anything?

07:43.100 --> 07:45.900
Yeah, that little squiggly thing
in the back of your throat.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.970
We are looking for someone
at Shea Stadium making our sandwich,

07:51.110 --> 07:53.010
so we can see what's in our sandwich.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.540
Now, concentrate.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.970
lf l go back in time
and look into a crystal ball,

07:58.110 --> 08:00.210
will l see me looking
into this crystal ball?

08:00.350 --> 08:03.440
Okay, that is not concentrating.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.710
Now--

08:08.520 --> 08:11.050
Now that was cool.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.860
lt's irreplaceable.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.890
l-- What am l gonna do?

08:16.030 --> 08:17.730
l know.

08:18.370 --> 08:21.990
Okay. Here, Justin, here.

08:22.140 --> 08:24.000
Do this spell on the crystal ball.

08:24.140 --> 08:25.830
When l had my powers,
it was a lifesaver.

08:25.970 --> 08:29.030
Say, ''Mcreary-timereary.''

08:29.180 --> 08:31.170
- Why?
- Just say it.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.440
Oh, and do this:

08:37.520 --> 08:40.280
Mcreary-timereary

08:42.360 --> 08:45.290
Did we just go back in time?
l have got to learn that.

08:45.430 --> 08:46.860
- Mcreary-time--
- Oh, no, no, no.

08:46.990 --> 08:49.290
That spell is just for emergencies.

08:49.430 --> 08:51.300
lt rewinds time for a few seconds

08:51.430 --> 08:54.770
to give wizards a chance to correct
a dire mistake.

08:54.900 --> 08:55.990
No questions.

08:56.140 --> 08:59.200
- You mean like a do-over spell?
- Yes.

08:59.570 --> 09:02.300
But it's too dangerous.
Don't even think about it, all right?

09:02.440 --> 09:04.600
lt bends time and space,
and you're not ready for it.

09:04.750 --> 09:05.910
No more questions.

09:06.050 --> 09:07.980
Do people remember
there's been a do-over spell?

09:08.120 --> 09:09.780
Only people in the magical world.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.820
Regular people have déjà vu.
Stop asking questions.

09:13.350 --> 09:15.840
So that's where déjà vu comes from.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.580
- l said, no more questions.
- lt wasn't a question.

09:18.730 --> 09:20.890
Hey, l have one. What's déjà vu?

09:21.030 --> 09:24.230
Well, it's when you feel
like something's happened before.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.530
For example, Dad, do you have $5?

09:28.070 --> 09:29.590
- Why?
- Because l need $5.

09:29.740 --> 09:32.040
Déjà vu, huh, Justin?

09:37.610 --> 09:39.440
So how did the big first-kiss go?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.780
lt didn't happen.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.340
Why not?

09:43.650 --> 09:46.550
Because when l went to pick her up,
she didn't wanna go to a scary house.

09:46.690 --> 09:48.680
She wanted to go
through some dark alley instead.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.120
But a dark alley's even better
than a scary house.

09:51.260 --> 09:54.690
But you said scary house.
l was totally focused on the scary house.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.390
The point is she wanted you to kiss her.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.520
Why didn't you take my advice?
Lots of people do.

09:59.670 --> 10:02.360
l'm the one that told Vice Principal
Clements to fix his dead tooth.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.530
Now he's getting married.

10:04.670 --> 10:07.370
- Okay, l panicked.
- Panicked?

10:07.840 --> 10:09.570
Well, now you gotta kiss her quick,
or else

10:09.710 --> 10:11.940
all she'll think you guys will ever be
is just friends.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.550
That's never gonna happen.
She's into me and l'm into her.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.550
That could change in a hurry.
Plenty of other guys think she's pretty.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.020
No way. Everyone around here knows
we're kind of going out.

10:20.150 --> 10:21.950
- You know, people respect that.
- Oh, really?

10:22.090 --> 10:24.080
- Well, let's see about that. Hey, Matt?
- Hey.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.350
Miranda's pretty cute, right?

10:26.490 --> 10:29.430
Yeah. You know, l got a note from her
in seventh grade, said she liked me.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.230
Bet you she still does too want me.

10:33.670 --> 10:35.690
That's too bad.
l hear she's going out with Justin.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.930
- Who's Justin?
- l'm Justin.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.160
So?

10:39.310 --> 10:40.360
Okay. Thanks, Matt.

10:40.510 --> 10:42.130
No, thank you for the heads up
on Miranda.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.940
Yo, Miranda, wait up there a sec.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.570
What did you just do?

10:47.950 --> 10:50.940
l just proved that not only do l know girls,
but l also know guys.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.480
No, you got Matt to ask out my girlfriend.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.480
Wait, l can fix this.

10:58.630 --> 11:00.620
Here's a cute girl. Kiss her.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.350
This is my Spanish teacher.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.730
l think l just told her
my name is Library.

11:14.210 --> 11:17.440
Well, Mr. Library, you should check out
a book on kissing.

11:19.380 --> 11:21.370
Thanks a lot.

11:27.190 --> 11:29.820
Look, Justin, l'm really sorry,
but you have to admit,

11:29.960 --> 11:32.790
Miss Gonzalez is
a young-looking teacher.

11:33.630 --> 11:35.290
l don't care about Mrs. Gonzalez.

11:35.430 --> 11:37.450
l care about how
my girlfriend's going to the movies

11:37.600 --> 11:39.690
with a guy that my sister set her up with.

11:39.830 --> 11:43.290
Will you relax? lt'll all work out
because l know relationships.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.910
You keep saying you know things
and you don't.

11:47.910 --> 11:49.930
Hey, l was right about Miranda wanting
to kiss you,

11:50.080 --> 11:52.270
and l was right about Matt thinking
she was pretty.

11:52.410 --> 11:55.540
Okay, fine, you were right.
Feel better? Because l don't.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.410
Look, Justin, the only thing
getting in the way here is you.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.140
You know what, l know.

12:00.290 --> 12:01.910
l've had a ton of chances
to kiss Miranda.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.920
l'm just mad at you
because l'm mad at me.

12:04.060 --> 12:05.460
You are? Yeah, you are.

12:05.590 --> 12:07.650
And if Miranda's ready to kiss me,
you know what?

12:07.790 --> 12:10.190
l should be ready to kiss her.
And it's not too late.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.820
- Yeah, it's not too late.
- And this time, l'm gonna be ready.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.300
What are you doing?

12:23.440 --> 12:25.470
Starting my training montage.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.140
lt's close but this one
has too much teriyaki.

13:40.290 --> 13:42.380
Honey, we didn't put any teriyaki on it.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.550
Then it needs teriyaki.

13:46.060 --> 13:49.360
This one has too much cheese,
this one needs barbecue sauce,

13:49.500 --> 13:53.160
and this one tastes like armpit.
How do you even know that?

13:53.670 --> 13:54.960
Wrestling.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.770
Honey, calm down.
Max is doing the best he can.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.840
Right, l know. Okay.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.680
Buddy, l know you're trying
as hard as you can.

14:06.810 --> 14:10.270
lt's just, if we can become the official
sandwich of the New York Mets,

14:10.420 --> 14:12.040
our life will be gravy.

14:12.190 --> 14:14.090
That's what's missing, gravy.

14:14.220 --> 14:18.020
Gravy? Then what are we doing
standing around talking about it?

14:18.160 --> 14:21.720
Oh, come on, gravy. Come on, gravy.

14:22.130 --> 14:23.930
Come on.

14:25.830 --> 14:28.160
- That's it. To the Max.
- Yeah.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.100
To the Max.

14:32.410 --> 14:34.240
Tastes even better the second time.

14:36.710 --> 14:40.370
So heard you're going out
with a guy named Justin.

14:40.510 --> 14:43.040
- Right, Justin?
- l thought we were, but l don't know.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.080
That's cool. Yeah, totally.

14:47.150 --> 14:49.650
Do you play video games at all?
You know, with a v--?

14:50.160 --> 14:52.320
- Do you know who makes video games?
- No.

14:52.460 --> 14:54.760
Corporate America.
l hate corporate America.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.590
l'm starting a school club about it.
We're looking for sponsors.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.600
Hey, guys. Matt.

15:02.740 --> 15:04.640
Hey, Matt, why don't you go
get us some popcorn?

15:04.770 --> 15:07.170
Yeah, l'll buy. Here.

15:07.310 --> 15:10.040
Twenty bucks? Thanks, dude.

15:10.180 --> 15:14.770
l can go play some
''Nitro Burning Funny Cars.'' Oh, yeah.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.250
Why are you here with him?
We're kind of going out.

15:20.390 --> 15:24.480
l know we hold hands and stuff,
but you act like we're just friends.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.580
- She was right.
- Who was right?

15:27.730 --> 15:30.420
Me. l was so right.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.900
l told him if he didn't kiss you soon,
you were gonna think

15:33.030 --> 15:36.130
that he wasn't all that into you.
And that's what you were thinking, right?

15:37.440 --> 15:39.100
Alex, what are you doing here?

15:39.240 --> 15:42.610
Look, l felt bad, so l came down here
to make sure that you kiss her.

15:42.740 --> 15:46.300
- You were gonna kiss me?
- Well, it's not a surprise now, is it?

15:46.450 --> 15:49.710
Sorry. l'll be back here if you need me.

15:49.850 --> 15:52.820
All right, just for that,
l'm leaving my cell phone on.

15:54.890 --> 15:59.350
Oh, look at those lovebirds.
lt's so great when things work out.

15:59.490 --> 16:01.550
Harper. What are you doing here?

16:01.930 --> 16:05.060
l'm not Harper. l'm just a theater seat,

16:05.200 --> 16:07.260
keeping an eye on my boyfriend.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.830
You made an outfit
to match the theater seats?

16:10.300 --> 16:12.530
Don't be freaked out
if you can't see me.

16:14.710 --> 16:17.270
lt's time to go to work.

16:26.490 --> 16:27.920
You were gonna kiss me?

16:28.050 --> 16:30.350
Well, only if you wanted to kiss me.
Do you?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.190
Or is me asking
totally ruining the moment?

16:32.560 --> 16:34.080
Nope.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.700
- l'll go left, you go right.
- Then we'll both be going the same way.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.470
Oh, yeah. Let's both go left.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.810
Justin, l'm a little nervous.

16:52.950 --> 16:54.540
This is our first kiss.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.450
Don't worry, l'll guide you through it.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.890
Miranda, l'm so sorry.

17:06.030 --> 17:07.079
l'll get some napkins.

17:07.230 --> 17:09.160
Where are you going?
Why didn't you kiss her yet?

17:09.300 --> 17:11.730
l spilled soda all over her.
She's never gonna kiss me now.

17:11.869 --> 17:14.770
- Wait, do it over.
- What do you mean?

17:14.900 --> 17:17.339
The spell that Dad used
on the crystal ball.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.630
No way. Dad said
that's for emergency use only.

17:25.150 --> 17:26.839
Because you don't know
l'm your girlfriend,

17:26.980 --> 17:29.570
doesn't mean you can sneak around
behind my back.

17:32.290 --> 17:34.450
How does that do-over spell
sound now?

17:35.190 --> 17:37.820
- Like it should have already happened.
- Now we're talking.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.690
Mcreary-timereary

17:42.330 --> 17:45.200
Justin, l'm a little nervous.

17:45.330 --> 17:47.160
This is our first kiss.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.560
l know.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.230
l mean, let me move this.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.610
This is gonna be a long night.

18:05.990 --> 18:07.750
Mcreary-timereary

18:08.990 --> 18:10.290
And that's why it's called:

18:10.420 --> 18:11.790
- To the Max.
- Right?

18:12.260 --> 18:14.990
- Nothing like it in the city.
- Kind of a buffet on a bun.

18:15.130 --> 18:16.250
What did l tell you?

18:16.400 --> 18:21.490
ls this the sandwich
for the New York Mets, Mets, Mets, Mets

18:21.640 --> 18:23.100
or what?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.970
You're right. This is delicious.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.680
Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Russo,

18:30.810 --> 18:34.540
To the Max is now the official sandwich
of the New York--

18:35.950 --> 18:37.420
And that's why it's called:

18:37.550 --> 18:39.210
- To the Max.
- Right?

18:39.350 --> 18:41.410
Dad, what just happened?

18:41.550 --> 18:42.610
l don't know.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.610
Good, but kind of familiar.

18:45.760 --> 18:49.090
You're right. lt's tasty, but familiar.

18:49.230 --> 18:53.030
Familiar? lt's a sandwich with popcorn.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.470
And that's why it's called:

18:57.600 --> 19:00.130
- To the Max.
- Right?

19:00.270 --> 19:02.640
- Nothing really new here.
- You're right.

19:02.780 --> 19:04.180
A better name would be Déjà Vu,

19:04.310 --> 19:08.300
because somehow l feel like
l've tasted this before.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.480
lt's the do-over spell.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.380
- l swear l'm not doing it.
- l know.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.420
But l'm pretty sure l know who is.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.360
Mcreary-timereary

19:34.970 --> 19:36.870
Mcreary-timereary

19:46.320 --> 19:48.150
Gross.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.420
Justin, that's 1 7 do-overs already.
What's wrong?

19:51.560 --> 19:53.890
l'm nervous. l'll get it this time.

19:54.030 --> 19:56.020
Okay, fine. Mcreary-time--

19:56.160 --> 19:58.560
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.460
So how's the sandwich-tasting go?

20:00.600 --> 20:04.130
l don't know, it's still going on,
and on and on.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.270
Dad, what are you doing here?

20:07.410 --> 20:09.840
No, the question is,
what is Alex doing the do-over spell for?

20:09.980 --> 20:12.100
l specifically told you never to use it.

20:12.250 --> 20:15.210
Actually, it's my fault, Dad.
l'm here with Miranda and l'm--

20:15.350 --> 20:18.110
He's trying to have his first kiss
and he just can't get it right.

20:18.490 --> 20:21.350
First kiss?
l thought that happened years ago.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.650
- l'll just take Miranda home.
- Wait, Justin.

20:25.790 --> 20:29.090
- How many times did you use the spell?
- l don't know. Seventeen?

20:31.600 --> 20:36.540
Well, l guess if you break a rule 1 7 times,
an 18th doesn't make a difference.

20:36.670 --> 20:40.400
Justin, you think you can get it right
if we do it over one more time?

20:40.970 --> 20:42.340
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.970
- Alex, do your magic.
- Thanks, Dad.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.870
Mcreary-timereary

20:50.920 --> 20:54.440
So l guess we're not the official sandwich
of the New York Mets, huh?

20:54.590 --> 20:58.920
The last thing they said was,
after one bite, they were tired of eating it.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.550
lsn't that weird?

21:01.330 --> 21:03.320
Yeah, weird.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.900
Justin got his first kiss.
Don't make a big deal.

21:08.370 --> 21:10.270
Your first kiss?

21:10.400 --> 21:12.960
Oh, my baby, you're growing up.

21:13.110 --> 21:16.630
Come here, come here.
Let me give you your second one.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.180
Mom.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.940
Hey, how about you, Alex?
What was your first kiss like?

21:22.280 --> 21:24.980
Oh, you know, like everyone else's.

21:25.390 --> 21:28.180
You already had your first kiss
and l missed it?

21:28.320 --> 21:30.220
Oh, tell me, tell me everything.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.450
No, not everything. She's my little girl.

21:32.590 --> 21:35.490
What's his name? l'll make him cry.

21:35.630 --> 21:36.930
Jerry.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.260
Tell us about it, honey.

21:39.870 --> 21:43.800
lt was at this place with this guy.

21:43.940 --> 21:47.370
And it was very romantic.
Over Christmas vacation.

21:47.510 --> 21:50.070
We went to see Grandma and Grandpa
over Christmas.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.180
Hold on, she's lying.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.780
You haven't kissed anyone.
l totally have this over you.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.250
- No, you don't.
- You're right.

21:58.380 --> 22:01.180
So when l go to school and tell everyone
you haven't kissed anyone,

22:01.320 --> 22:02.580
no one will care.

22:08.130 --> 22:09.530
Yeah.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.290
Hey, Justin.

22:18.340 --> 22:21.000
Now you've got nothing over me.
