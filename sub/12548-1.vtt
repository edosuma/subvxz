(Motor whirring)

00:11.998 --> 00:14.100
Hospitality, this is Tango Five.

00:14.167 --> 00:16.035
We're four mikes out,
requesting hot extract.

00:16.102 --> 00:18.104
Hopper, stay with me.

00:21.541 --> 00:23.042
Hospitality, this is Tango Five.

00:23.109 --> 00:26.045
We're at the rendezvous. Over.

00:26.112 --> 00:28.281
Hospitality, this is Tango Five.

(Beeping stops)

00:50.000 --> 00:52.305
Helm, ready for dive. We're
not gonna be here long.

00:52.371 --> 00:53.706
Chief of the boat,

00:53.773 --> 00:55.521
you get those SEALs on
board as fast as you can.

00:55.641 --> 00:57.009
I have multiple contacts.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.219
Something big outside the lane.
Classifying now.

00:59.644 --> 01:02.247
Gentlemen, we have just surfaced
in the middle of a highway.

01:02.314 --> 01:03.882
Let me know if anything acts pissy.

01:03.949 --> 01:05.750
Lieutenant Shepard,

01:05.817 --> 01:07.452
I need three good ways out of here.

01:07.519 --> 01:08.687
Aye-aye, sir.

01:08.753 --> 01:09.654
Sir, big boy at sea

01:09.721 --> 01:11.056
is a Pakistani Zulfiquar class frigate

01:11.122 --> 01:13.158
turning on our position.

01:13.225 --> 01:15.193
Captain, the hatch is shut.
Straight board.

01:15.313 --> 01:16.995
Submerge the boat, lieutenant.

01:17.062 --> 01:18.663
Dive! Dive!

01:18.730 --> 01:20.699
Venting forward. Venting aft.

01:20.765 --> 01:24.436
Ahead two-thirds. Come to 2-7-5.

01:24.502 --> 01:26.438
Lieutenant Shepard, you have the conn.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.240
X.O., you're with me.

01:28.306 --> 01:29.708
Sir.

01:29.774 --> 01:30.642
Relax, lieutenant.

01:30.709 --> 01:32.277
We aren't actually at war.

01:32.344 --> 01:33.612
Just make him realize

01:33.678 --> 01:36.348
how incredibly dead he'd be if we were.

01:37.882 --> 01:40.018
(Man) Captain.

01:40.085 --> 01:42.220
X.O.

01:42.735 --> 01:43.954
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

01:44.074 --> 01:44.767
Thanks, chief.

01:44.887 --> 01:47.058
You bet, son.

01:48.660 --> 01:50.729
Careful with these boys.

01:50.795 --> 01:53.164
They're wound tight.

01:55.075 --> 01:57.389
Gil Langston, captain.
Thank you for the pickup.

01:57.509 --> 01:59.304
Anytime. How's your man?

01:59.371 --> 02:00.639
Needs a hospital.

02:00.705 --> 02:01.973
We're headed towards
the Eisenhower group

02:02.040 --> 02:03.275
to test a new piece of equipment.

02:03.341 --> 02:05.076
Five hours, we'll be in
range of the choppers.

02:05.143 --> 02:07.245
That's some serious heat
that came after you guys.

02:07.312 --> 02:10.482
Anything we should know?

02:10.548 --> 02:12.851
Once again, captain, thank
you for the pickup.

02:12.918 --> 02:15.887
(People speaking indistinctly)

02:15.954 --> 02:18.890
You had to ask, didn't you?

02:18.957 --> 02:20.725
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

02:20.792 --> 02:23.828
What the hell happened back there?

02:25.964 --> 02:27.332
Cortez, Reynolds,

02:27.399 --> 02:29.067
don't make me chase you down.

02:29.134 --> 02:31.703
(Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.)

02:31.770 --> 02:33.939
1400 hours, day 56 of the tour,

02:34.005 --> 02:36.541
this is a meeting to
allow you to inform me

02:36.608 --> 02:38.410
if any member of the crew
has acted towards you

02:38.476 --> 02:39.978
in a manner offensive to yourself

02:40.045 --> 02:41.646
or to the other female
members of your rack,

02:41.713 --> 02:43.648
or in a manner contrary... (Laughs)

02:43.715 --> 02:45.450
To the rules and regulations
of Navy policy.

02:45.517 --> 02:46.651
But how are you...

02:46.718 --> 02:48.119
how are you supposed
to do sensitivity duty

02:48.186 --> 02:49.654
and you all talking about "racks"?

02:49.721 --> 02:50.989
(Chuckles)

02:51.056 --> 02:53.291
Just answer the question, Cortez.

02:53.358 --> 02:56.328
No one has offended,
bothered, copped a feel,

02:56.448 --> 02:59.062
or otherwise molested
any member of my rack.

02:59.182 --> 03:00.722
Love these weekly chats, though.

03:00.842 --> 03:02.404
Welcome to the Navy, sailor.

03:03.777 --> 03:05.245
(Man) No, no, no, no, man, look.

03:05.312 --> 03:06.880
He's like, he's like...

03:06.947 --> 03:10.217
(Beatboxing)

03:10.283 --> 03:11.585
(Chuckles) Stupid.

03:11.652 --> 03:12.994
It's a feeling, V.
It's not intellectual.

03:12.995 --> 03:14.035
Stupid.

03:14.155 --> 03:15.990
No, I mean, look, you're...
you're from Arizona, right?

03:16.110 --> 03:17.567
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm not even being offensive,

03:17.698 --> 03:19.200
'cause I got a cousin from Tucson...
(Laughs)

03:19.267 --> 03:21.035
But it just means that you
have no idea what he's doing.

03:21.101 --> 03:21.791
I have no idea?

03:21.911 --> 03:23.521
No. You think he's all "ho
this" and "bitch that"...

03:23.541 --> 03:24.352
that's not what I said.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.906
And it's just not the case.
It's just not the...

03:25.973 --> 03:27.712
Really? Are you guys still at this?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.492
X.O., permission to shoot

03:29.612 --> 03:31.579
petty Officer Brannan in the head.

03:32.262 --> 03:33.815
Permission granted.

03:36.064 --> 03:37.499
Closest thing to an actual engagement

03:37.565 --> 03:39.401
we'll probably ever see,
and he gives her the conn?

03:39.467 --> 03:40.902
Just hands it over,

03:40.969 --> 03:42.837
like "Here you go, sweetheart.
You have fun with that."

03:42.904 --> 03:44.539
Yeah, nice being an admiral's kid.

03:44.606 --> 03:45.707
(Chuckles) Yeah.

03:45.774 --> 03:47.108
(Imitates female voice) "Oh, captain,

03:47.175 --> 03:48.977
are you really gonna let
me drive the boat?"

03:51.046 --> 03:52.414
Ma'am.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.149
(Man speaks indistinctly over P.A.)

03:54.215 --> 03:56.151
X.O., captain wants to see you

03:56.217 --> 03:57.752
in his quarters when you're done.

03:57.819 --> 04:00.522
Mm-hmm.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.624
(Equipment beeping, people
speaking indistinctly)

04:02.691 --> 04:04.761
X.O. on the conn.

04:04.881 --> 04:07.629
(Man) X.O. on the conn.

04:07.696 --> 04:09.864
(Lowered voice) Your
guys Lawrence and Stern,

04:09.931 --> 04:11.866
they're busting Grace's balls.

04:11.933 --> 04:13.501
(Chuckles)

04:13.568 --> 04:17.839
I wasn't aware of the
presence of those, sir.

04:17.906 --> 04:20.208
Consider it taken care of.

04:20.274 --> 04:22.577
Thank you.

04:22.644 --> 04:24.512
(Knock on door)

04:24.579 --> 04:26.581
Come in. (Door opens)

04:26.648 --> 04:27.749
(Man speaks indistinctly over P.A.)

04:27.816 --> 04:29.384
(Door closes)

04:29.451 --> 04:30.552
How's Jeffrey doing?

04:30.618 --> 04:32.654
You must be proud.

04:32.721 --> 04:34.489
Yeah, he says he's jealous of me,

04:34.556 --> 04:36.324
being surrounded by water.

04:36.391 --> 04:37.525
(Chuckles)

04:37.592 --> 04:39.478
Guess it's pretty dry where they are.

04:39.598 --> 04:41.396
Listen, Cameron's been
tracking the fleet.

04:41.463 --> 04:42.564
He's doing that thing that he does.

04:42.630 --> 04:43.647
What do you know about

04:43.767 --> 04:45.408
the Eisenhower group changing course?

04:48.069 --> 04:50.004
Here's the latest surface grab.

04:50.071 --> 04:52.440
D.C. is falling apart.

04:52.507 --> 04:54.209
(Woman) Four generals
resigned in protest,

04:54.275 --> 04:56.182
calling the president's
policies reckless

04:56.302 --> 04:57.479
and irresponsible.

04:57.545 --> 04:58.747
As the impeachment vote approaches,

04:58.813 --> 05:00.382
the embattled president...

05:00.448 --> 05:02.017
(TV beeps)

05:02.083 --> 05:05.954
Ronald Reagan fires all the
air traffic controllers.

05:06.021 --> 05:07.822
And his guys come to him, and they say,

05:07.889 --> 05:10.065
"Mr. President, why did you
go and do such a thing?

05:10.185 --> 05:12.861
Everyone's gonna think you're crazy."

05:12.927 --> 05:14.729
And Reagan...

05:14.796 --> 05:16.564
He points out the window
of the Oval Office

05:16.631 --> 05:17.499
toward Russia,

05:17.565 --> 05:19.768
and he says, "That's right.

05:19.834 --> 05:23.405
That's exactly what I need
that bastard to think."

05:23.471 --> 05:25.040
Uh, what are we celebrating?

05:25.106 --> 05:26.775
You see, everyone knew
Brezhnev was crazy.

05:26.841 --> 05:28.576
Hell, he invaded Afghanistan.

05:28.643 --> 05:31.813
The problem was, nobody
knew if Reagan was.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.249
And if there's one absolute truth

05:34.315 --> 05:36.584
to being the man with your
finger on the button,

05:36.651 --> 05:37.819
that's it.

05:37.886 --> 05:39.988
They have to think you're crazy.

05:40.055 --> 05:42.490
(Chuckles)
Here's to being 500 feet under

05:42.557 --> 05:44.492
and half a world away from it all.

05:44.559 --> 05:45.827
(Clinks)

05:45.894 --> 05:47.929
(Chuckles)

05:51.433 --> 05:54.069
Ahh.

06:00.608 --> 06:02.711
Will Frears is looking for a second

06:02.777 --> 06:05.714
at Naval Command, Virginia.

06:05.780 --> 06:07.382
I recommended you.

06:08.621 --> 06:10.618
You can take a week with
Christine once we get back

06:10.685 --> 06:12.053
and make the move.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.488
Marcus... (Chuckles)

06:13.555 --> 06:15.490
Whatever you think you owe me, Sam,

06:15.557 --> 06:18.026
you've paid a hundred times over.

06:18.093 --> 06:19.527
You have a wife.

06:19.594 --> 06:22.397
Go home. Take a desk.

06:22.464 --> 06:24.799
Start a family.

06:28.303 --> 06:30.304
(Door closes)

06:39.747 --> 06:41.148
Chief of the boat.

06:41.215 --> 06:42.983
Listen, Grace, um...

06:43.050 --> 06:45.185
Lawrence and Stern,

06:45.252 --> 06:48.188
they'll be pulling
latrine duty for a week.

06:48.255 --> 06:49.556
I just hope you understand,

06:49.623 --> 06:52.459
it's not about you being a woman.

06:52.526 --> 06:55.262
I just haven't earned their respect.

06:55.329 --> 06:56.931
Well...

06:56.997 --> 06:58.465
Two weeks latrine duty for both of them,

06:58.532 --> 07:01.402
and, C.O.B., you address
me by my rank or ma'am,

07:01.468 --> 07:03.203
not my first name.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.024
Lieutenant Shepard, position report.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.351
1,012 clicks south west
of Sri Lanka, sir.

07:17.418 --> 07:19.358
Crossing the equator in... (Beeping)

07:19.478 --> 07:20.882
Oh, crossing now, sir.

(Alarm blares)

08:32.923 --> 08:35.192
Sir, I have a decoded missile fire order

08:35.259 --> 08:37.628
from D.O.D. Emergency Antarctic Network.

08:37.693 --> 08:39.730
Antarctica?

08:45.168 --> 08:46.370
(Dial clicks)

08:57.080 --> 08:58.215
Authenticate the order.

08:58.282 --> 09:00.217
Fire order, authentication code

09:00.284 --> 09:03.827
Victor-Zulu-Zulu-Charlie,
Mike-Yankee-X-Ray-Whiskey...

09:03.947 --> 09:05.464
Zulu-Delta-Delta-Kilo.

09:05.584 --> 09:06.627
The order's authenticated.

09:06.747 --> 09:07.710
I concur.

09:07.830 --> 09:09.559
Sweet mother of God.

09:13.230 --> 09:15.165
They shouldn't be using
the Antarctica network.

09:15.232 --> 09:16.230
They would only do that if...

09:16.250 --> 09:18.344
If the main one was taken
out by a full strike.

09:22.516 --> 09:24.641
Weapons conn, we have an
authenticated fire order.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.240
Spin up missiles one through four.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.879
Weapons, this is the X.O.
I concur with the captain.

09:28.946 --> 09:31.415
(Beeping)
Helm, come to heading 0-2-0.

09:31.481 --> 09:33.050
Come to missile firing depth.

09:36.753 --> 09:38.455
(Man) Conn, weapons. Targets locked.

09:38.522 --> 09:40.657
Missiles spinning up.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.762
X.O...

09:45.829 --> 09:48.565
Insert your key into the firing station.

09:59.509 --> 10:02.479
We're both thinking it.
Go ahead and say it.

10:02.546 --> 10:05.749
Why the Antarctic Network?

10:05.816 --> 10:07.851
They'd only use it if D.C.
command was gone

10:07.918 --> 10:10.787
or it was rendered inoperable.

10:10.854 --> 10:12.923
Captain, let's just take a look.

10:20.464 --> 10:22.130
Communications, roll out the antenna.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.368
Get us something to look at.

10:25.636 --> 10:28.205
Sir, we're cleared to fire.

10:28.272 --> 10:29.373
Ever put on one of your favorite...

10:29.439 --> 10:30.941
launch, where she
was joined by some...

10:31.008 --> 10:33.377
(cheers and applause)

10:33.443 --> 10:34.912
Get me national command.

10:34.978 --> 10:36.862
(Chief) Sir, you break radio silence,

10:36.982 --> 10:39.216
we're in direct
contradiction to procedure.

10:39.283 --> 10:41.084
Noted.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.688
Get 'em on the horn, Chris.

10:44.755 --> 10:46.123
(Buzzer sounds)

10:46.189 --> 10:48.892
U.S.S. "Colorado" command,
this is National Command.

10:49.570 --> 10:52.496
This is captain Marcus Chaplin,
U.S.S. "Colorado."

10:52.562 --> 10:54.231
I have an authenticated fire order

10:54.298 --> 10:56.166
through the Antarctic secondary network.

10:56.233 --> 10:58.168
Requesting confirmation of the order

10:58.235 --> 10:59.970
through the standard E.A.M. Network.

11:00.037 --> 11:01.838
Captain, you have an
authenticated fire order.

11:01.905 --> 11:03.169
I'm aware of that.

11:03.289 --> 11:05.235
Now send it through the proper channel.

11:05.355 --> 11:07.411
Why aren't we firing?
It's a direct order, sir.

11:07.477 --> 11:09.713
Captain, are you refusing the order?

11:09.780 --> 11:11.515
Listen, whoever the hell you are,

11:11.582 --> 11:13.884
I don't have a declaration of war

11:13.951 --> 11:15.419
and I see no reason for this order

11:15.485 --> 11:17.387
to come through a secondary channel,

11:17.454 --> 11:19.932
which we all know was designed
only to be used in the event

11:20.052 --> 11:22.092
that D.C. command was wiped out.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.094
But I'm sitting here
watching "Hannah Montana,"

11:24.161 --> 11:28.065
so I'm not going to annihilate
4.3 million Pakistanis

11:28.131 --> 11:29.900
without hearing directly from someone

11:29.967 --> 11:32.069
whose authority I recognize.

11:32.135 --> 11:34.571
Get me someone I can talk to.

11:34.638 --> 11:36.006
"Colorado" out.

11:36.073 --> 11:37.207
(Beeps)

11:42.479 --> 11:43.814
(Door opens)

11:43.880 --> 11:45.914
(Woman) The U.S.S "Colorado"...

11:46.034 --> 11:48.514
Ohio class nuclear submarine,

11:48.634 --> 11:51.070
150 men on board.

11:51.137 --> 11:53.639
Actually, since last year,
nine enlisted women

11:53.706 --> 11:56.442
and two female officers as well.

11:56.509 --> 11:58.952
It makes its own air...

11:59.072 --> 12:01.180
power.

12:01.247 --> 12:04.850
It's got four mark 48 torpedo tubes,

12:04.917 --> 12:06.485
28 tomahawks,

12:06.552 --> 12:08.912
and 18 trident nuclear missiles,

12:09.032 --> 12:10.436
which can basically

12:10.707 --> 12:14.994
wipe out anything, anywhere, anytime.

12:17.732 --> 12:20.329
God, I love it when you
talk military hardware.

12:20.605 --> 12:21.973
Yeah, I know. I'm good, right?

12:22.040 --> 12:23.174
Mm-hmm.

12:23.241 --> 12:24.375
(Laughs) But see,

12:24.442 --> 12:26.310
the "Colorado" has the
same problem you do.

12:26.377 --> 12:27.478
Magnetism.

12:27.594 --> 12:28.961
(Both laugh)

12:29.081 --> 12:31.138
Big sexy boat like that,

12:31.157 --> 12:32.814
it has its own magnetic signature,

12:32.815 --> 12:36.861
which turns a $4-billion
sub into a sitting duck.

12:36.981 --> 12:39.506
Except now with the
prototype I've put on board,

12:39.573 --> 12:40.902
no signature.

12:42.676 --> 12:43.587
Ooh.

12:43.643 --> 12:47.059
The Navy is already
drooling over this thing.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.242
And after tomorrow's test,

12:48.243 --> 12:50.083
they're gonna want lots of them.

12:50.150 --> 12:53.587
That is where your senator comes in.

12:53.653 --> 12:55.522
Who can say no to you?

12:55.589 --> 12:56.890
(Laughs)

12:56.957 --> 12:58.091
Mm. Mm.

12:58.158 --> 12:59.626
(Cell phone chimes)

12:59.693 --> 13:02.544
Oh, don't you... (Muffled
voice) dare. No.

13:02.829 --> 13:04.165
No.

13:04.631 --> 13:05.848
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.300
(Normal voice) You can't be serious.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.639
What's "472 Chaplin"?
Is that an address?

13:09.703 --> 13:10.571
No.

13:10.596 --> 13:12.211
Tell me you don't have
another meeting tonight.

13:12.248 --> 13:15.570
No. Trust me, Robert, there
is nowhere I would rather be,

13:15.639 --> 13:18.073
and nothing and no one
I would rather be doing,

13:18.080 --> 13:19.156
but I've gotta go.

13:19.179 --> 13:21.381
(Mutters) Hey, this...

13:21.448 --> 13:22.496
(door opens)

13:22.522 --> 13:24.050
This is your apartment.

13:24.117 --> 13:25.869
(Door closes)

13:33.927 --> 13:36.363
(Buzzer sounds)

13:41.754 --> 13:43.343
Captain Marcus Chaplin.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.426
(Man) Captain, this is Deputy
Secretary of Defense William Curry.

13:46.546 --> 13:48.916
We met about a year ago at a CSG2 event.

13:48.935 --> 13:51.144
Do you recognize my voice?

13:51.211 --> 13:52.312
I do, sir.

13:53.252 --> 13:55.016
Although, why isn't
the secretary himself

13:55.029 --> 13:56.030
or the president on the line?

13:56.042 --> 13:58.470
Captain Marcus Chaplin, you
are relieved of your command

13:58.495 --> 14:00.823
under section 472 of the naval code.

14:01.011 --> 14:03.523
Please pass me to your first officer.

14:17.896 --> 14:20.307
This is "Colorado" X.O. Sam Kendal.

14:20.373 --> 14:21.712
Lieutenant Commander Kendal,

14:21.731 --> 14:24.377
as of this moment, you are
advanced to Captain of the Boat.

14:24.841 --> 14:27.981
You have an authorized
fire order, do you not?

14:32.486 --> 14:34.414
Affirmative, sir.

14:35.422 --> 14:37.924
Lieutenant Shepard, take the
firing key from Captain Chaplin

14:37.943 --> 14:40.627
and insert it into the firing computer.

15:13.845 --> 15:16.384
Mr. Curry, this is the
acting Captain Sam Kendal.

15:16.602 --> 15:20.800
Request that you send the order
via the regular E.A.M. channel, sir.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.472
Okay, Captain. Stand by.

15:23.865 --> 15:25.535
(Beeps) Line's dead, sir.

15:25.767 --> 15:27.512
(Langston) What the
hell's going on here?

15:28.401 --> 15:30.566
Why is the crew talking
about you refusing orders?

15:30.567 --> 15:33.062
Chief of the Boat, remove
these men from the conn.

15:34.940 --> 15:36.841
I'm not going anywhere
till I see those orders.

15:36.842 --> 15:38.419
You have no authority
here. This is my boat.

15:38.425 --> 15:40.412
So get your ass off this conn now.

15:40.433 --> 15:42.581
You heard the man.

15:42.648 --> 15:44.616
There's no way we're
not seeing that order.

15:44.683 --> 15:46.677
They are not your orders to see.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.954
I thought you SEAL boys
were supposed to be smart.

15:49.021 --> 15:50.913
Bullets and submarines
don't get along so well.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.134
That's okay, Captain. We don't miss.

15:53.254 --> 15:55.605
(Alarm blaring) Sir, I have inbound
cruise missile on our position!

15:55.661 --> 15:57.429
Oh, my God. 20 seconds out.

15:57.496 --> 15:58.914
(Chaplin) Emergency deep!

15:58.930 --> 16:01.805
All hands! Emergency deep!
Emergency deep!

16:01.817 --> 16:03.534
- (Chaplin) Right full rudder!
- Grab on to something.

16:03.535 --> 16:04.569
Ten seconds out.

16:04.636 --> 16:07.955
Point us at the bottom. Hold on!

16:08.173 --> 16:09.741
Here it comes!

16:09.808 --> 16:11.343
(Whistles)

16:11.410 --> 16:13.912
(Booms)

16:13.979 --> 16:17.115
(Indistinct shouting)

16:20.524 --> 16:21.826
Bring us up!

16:21.853 --> 16:23.697
Negative! Control
surfaces are nonresponsive.

16:23.710 --> 16:24.692
Rebooting the system.

16:24.698 --> 16:26.313
(Kendal) All hands, we
have water in the boat!

16:26.325 --> 16:27.714
Evacuate forward compartment.

16:27.745 --> 16:29.765
Seal auxiliary engine. Seal sick bay.

16:29.796 --> 16:32.164
Hey, sick bay? Hopper.

16:32.643 --> 16:33.940
Wait! Hold sick bay.
I'll do it on-site.

16:33.941 --> 16:35.237
We're back online.

16:35.256 --> 16:36.320
- Emergency blow.
- Blowing tanks.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.854
Bottom approaching!

16:38.923 --> 16:39.649
50 feet!

16:39.769 --> 16:42.173
40. 30. We're going in.

16:42.176 --> 16:43.928
All hands, brace for impact!

16:43.995 --> 16:46.898
(Rumbling)

16:46.965 --> 16:48.299
(Alarm blares)

16:48.366 --> 16:51.736
(Rumbling continues)

17:11.968 --> 17:14.527
(Grunting)

17:20.690 --> 17:24.031
(Metal creaking)

17:25.151 --> 17:26.358
(Both panting and grunting)

17:26.377 --> 17:27.935
What about an extraction team?

17:27.948 --> 17:31.470
Too deep! We're 1,500,
maybe 1,600 feet down!

17:31.520 --> 17:33.629
Hull's only rated to 1,300.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.762
(Creaking continues)

17:35.882 --> 17:37.419
We gotta leave right now!

17:37.420 --> 17:38.934
We're right behind you with Hopper.

17:38.940 --> 17:41.343
(Clanks) Ohh!

17:41.988 --> 17:43.564
Gil!

17:46.523 --> 17:48.225
(Creaking continues)

17:48.450 --> 17:51.265
Come on! Help me close this!

17:54.274 --> 17:57.529
(Both grunting)

17:59.698 --> 18:01.399
(Water rushing)

18:11.176 --> 18:13.712
(Squawks)

18:18.721 --> 18:20.986
(Woman) * I never felt like *

18:21.023 --> 18:24.151
♪ he could be my hero ♪

18:25.040 --> 18:26.691
(Women) * uh-huh *

18:26.758 --> 18:28.643
♪ he's the man for me ♪

18:28.644 --> 18:30.102
♪ he's the man for me ♪

18:30.165 --> 18:34.194
♪ oh, heaven help
me, we will be, yeah ♪

18:34.314 --> 18:37.622
(British accent) We're not having
a malfunction of our equipment here.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.284
No, excuse me.

18:39.293 --> 18:41.632
We're looking at a clear
missile signature.

18:42.073 --> 18:43.241
Yes, I understand. (Beeps)

18:43.247 --> 18:44.849
But we're a NATO early warning station.

18:44.855 --> 18:46.238
Your regulations require...

18:46.250 --> 18:47.670
(european accent) Look,
the acceleration here.

18:47.689 --> 18:48.778
That's an American tomahawk.

18:48.803 --> 18:49.954
It's a tomahawk.

18:50.582 --> 18:52.462
Yes, one of your missiles was in the air

18:52.463 --> 18:54.334
in the vicinity of India and Pakistan,

18:54.454 --> 18:57.275
which could lead to a nuclear
power shooting back at you,

18:57.319 --> 18:58.470
and that's...

18:58.590 --> 19:01.459
you know, not good.

19:01.526 --> 19:02.694
Understood.

19:02.761 --> 19:03.895
(Door opens)

19:04.129 --> 19:06.498
- Bastards.
- Focus on the target area.

19:06.519 --> 19:09.772
Go back into the record,
everything for the past hour.

19:10.602 --> 19:13.405
Give me something I can
take to NATO command.

19:13.471 --> 19:14.797
Julian,

19:14.803 --> 19:17.569
I know the rest of this island
pretty much kisses your ass,

19:17.587 --> 19:19.864
but you can't just waltz in here.

19:19.877 --> 19:21.178
There's no gate in this world,

19:21.234 --> 19:24.433
there's not something
somebody wants won't unlock it.

19:24.553 --> 19:27.719
- Happy birthday.
- (Laughs) Oh.

19:29.802 --> 19:30.916
Thank you.

19:31.990 --> 19:34.257
But now you need to go. Uh, how much?

19:34.377 --> 19:35.846
It's a gift, Sophie.

19:36.322 --> 19:38.487
Someday, you'll give me a gift.

19:41.299 --> 19:44.502
(Classical music playing)

19:47.472 --> 19:48.974
(Knock on door)

19:49.040 --> 19:52.043
(Music continues)

19:57.289 --> 19:59.518
(Sighs) Boat's damaged.

19:59.584 --> 20:01.261
We got casualties.

20:02.187 --> 20:03.232
We don't know who hit us

20:03.250 --> 20:04.996
or if they're waiting
up top for a second shot.

20:05.046 --> 20:06.673
We got 150 lives at stake here,

20:06.698 --> 20:08.894
and the man best equipped
to lead us out of this mess

20:09.427 --> 20:11.923
is sitting in his room
chilling out to Mozart.

20:13.231 --> 20:15.400
I need your help.

20:15.467 --> 20:16.984
They need your help.

20:18.530 --> 20:20.056
They have a captain.

20:20.672 --> 20:22.674
(Music continues)

20:22.741 --> 20:23.741
You.

20:24.476 --> 20:28.647
(Music continues)

20:38.023 --> 20:41.326
(Clattering)

20:41.393 --> 20:43.461
(Rumbling)

20:43.528 --> 20:45.664
(People speaking indistinctly)

20:45.730 --> 20:47.250
Captain on the conn.

20:47.275 --> 20:48.183
We're clear, sir.

20:48.245 --> 20:50.185
All ahead, dead crawl coming to 0-9-0.

20:50.203 --> 20:52.070
Thank you.

20:53.572 --> 20:54.909
Something else?

20:56.041 --> 20:58.175
Well, a lot of the
crew's been wondering...

20:58.610 --> 21:00.278
what happens next?

21:08.260 --> 21:10.112
This is... (Clears throat)

21:12.691 --> 21:14.192
this is the acting captain.

21:14.259 --> 21:17.088
The "Colorado" has been
returned to operational status.

21:17.929 --> 21:19.685
We lost 12 souls in the attack.

21:20.336 --> 21:22.307
There will be time to mourn them later.

21:25.470 --> 21:27.355
The officers of this vessel

21:27.368 --> 21:29.238
will eventually appear
before the proper authorities

21:29.241 --> 21:31.376
to explain our actions.

21:31.443 --> 21:33.153
Till then, let's get somewhere safe

21:33.154 --> 21:35.500
so we can all see our families again.

21:36.848 --> 21:39.073
Everybody do their job.

21:39.486 --> 21:40.986
Son of a bitch.

21:41.052 --> 21:43.255
I got a fix on the
boat who shot us, sir.

21:43.321 --> 21:44.604
It's the "Illinois."

21:44.804 --> 21:46.462
Our own people tried to sink us?

21:46.582 --> 21:48.583
What do you think happens
when you ignore orders?

21:48.626 --> 21:51.153
We didn't ignore anything.
We questioned.

21:51.696 --> 21:53.319
You don't hit your own people for that.

21:53.363 --> 21:56.659
This is insane. We can't hide
from the entire U.S. Navy forever.

21:56.660 --> 21:57.693
(Chief) The Lieutenant's right.

21:57.711 --> 21:59.294
We need to surface and
wave the white flag.

21:59.295 --> 22:01.673
And what if they use
that flag as a target?

22:01.740 --> 22:03.211
We don't know what their orders are.

22:03.267 --> 22:05.844
All we know is that there's
something seriously wrong in D.C.,

22:05.869 --> 22:07.045
so we're leaving this party.

22:07.052 --> 22:08.980
That's your damn plan?

22:09.047 --> 22:11.788
To run? To where? For how long?

22:11.801 --> 22:13.884
That's enough, C.O.B.!
Go make your rounds!

22:15.085 --> 22:16.837
Old Navy saying...

22:17.389 --> 22:19.824
"The stupid will be punished."

22:19.891 --> 22:22.961
Are you challenging my authority?

22:24.429 --> 22:26.364
I'll repeat the question.

22:26.431 --> 22:29.467
Do you acknowledge my authority or not?

22:31.803 --> 22:33.171
I do.

22:33.795 --> 22:36.291
(Footsteps approach) We get
shot by an American boat?

22:37.755 --> 22:39.844
The "Illinois." How did you know?

22:39.911 --> 22:42.781
Helm, come to 0-8-3.

22:46.251 --> 22:48.754
The captain was relieved of duty.

22:48.773 --> 22:49.887
Man your station, Lieutenant.

22:49.930 --> 22:51.476
Not on orders from you, no, sir.

22:51.488 --> 22:55.228
Chief of the Boat, remove
Lieutenant Cahill from the conn.

22:55.229 --> 22:56.747
Now!

23:07.293 --> 23:09.394
You all know this is wrong.

23:11.974 --> 23:14.076
Captain has the conn.

23:16.384 --> 23:17.918
Captain has the conn.

23:19.587 --> 23:21.959
Grace, I need you to plot a course.

23:23.091 --> 23:25.560
I think I found our oasis.

23:30.538 --> 23:32.033
Nice speech.

23:34.548 --> 23:37.101
(Woman) Well, anyway, Sam's
underwater for two more months.

23:37.401 --> 23:39.238
Why have I been taking business classes

23:39.239 --> 23:41.061
if I don't have the guts
to start a real business?

23:41.111 --> 23:42.500
(Knock on door) (Dog barks)

23:42.537 --> 23:44.102
Mom, I gotta go. Emma's coming over.

23:44.109 --> 23:46.347
We're going to talk
materials and pricing.

23:46.414 --> 23:49.284
(Telephone beeps) (Hinges squeak)

23:52.487 --> 23:53.506
No.

23:53.626 --> 23:56.171
(Man) Pentagon sources
say a Pakistani warship

23:56.190 --> 23:58.668
fired without warning at the Ohio class

23:58.699 --> 24:00.562
nuclear submarine U.S.S. "Colorado"

24:00.628 --> 24:02.616
as it was conducting...

24:07.496 --> 24:09.270
(Woman) Admiral Shepard.

24:09.337 --> 24:10.618
I think you'll want to talk to me.

24:10.619 --> 24:12.373
It's about the "Colorado," sir.

24:12.440 --> 24:13.782
Do I know you?

24:13.902 --> 24:16.395
Kylie Sinclair from Sinclair Dynatronic.

24:16.451 --> 24:18.613
We had a prototype on
board the "Colorado."

24:18.986 --> 24:20.882
I'm sorry about your daughter, sir.

24:20.949 --> 24:23.384
We've been attacked, we're at Defcon 2,

24:23.451 --> 24:25.711
and you want to talk about your toy?

24:25.831 --> 24:27.969
We both know the
Pakistanis didn't sink her.

24:28.020 --> 24:30.191
No matter what you're
telling the American people.

24:30.258 --> 24:30.992
What?

24:31.023 --> 24:34.413
It took me a year to get
my system on the "Colorado,"

24:34.414 --> 24:36.064
and I am not gonna wait another year.

24:36.130 --> 24:38.066
So if you want me to keep quiet,

24:38.132 --> 24:40.545
you put my equipment on
the next boat that goes out.

24:40.558 --> 24:42.428
You get the hell out of my face.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.013
A friend in Navy intelligence
sent me this text...

24:45.038 --> 24:46.458
"472 Chaplin"...

24:46.489 --> 24:47.913
five minutes before
the "Colorado" was hit.

24:47.914 --> 24:48.937
What friend?

24:48.944 --> 24:50.508
Naval command was processing

24:50.531 --> 24:53.361
a 472 protocol removal
of Captain Chaplin.

24:53.380 --> 24:56.020
You had a rogue captain
of a nuclear submarine.

24:56.140 --> 24:58.129
And with 18 tridents on board,

24:58.152 --> 25:00.375
no one was gonna take any chances.

25:00.412 --> 25:04.292
So you sank your own boat... sir.

25:04.359 --> 25:06.160
You son of a bitch.

25:06.227 --> 25:09.230
You sank your own daughter's boat.

25:13.968 --> 25:15.058
You didn't know?

25:15.440 --> 25:16.209
(Woman) Sir?

25:17.305 --> 25:19.207
We need to go now.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.333
(Blows air)

25:31.334 --> 25:31.870
(Sighs)

25:36.986 --> 25:39.896
(Woman) I know it's
selfish, but don't go.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.580
Go awol. (Chuckles)

25:41.630 --> 25:43.388
We'll go on the run together...

25:43.508 --> 25:46.348
town to town, hiding
out, living off the land.

25:47.043 --> 25:49.750
- What, like Bonnie and Clyde?
- Bonnie and Clyde...

25:50.557 --> 25:53.835
Minus all the bullets
at the end. (Chuckles)

25:53.955 --> 25:55.666
Right.

25:59.408 --> 26:01.645
I'll be back in four months.

26:08.417 --> 26:10.441
(Voice breaks) Oh, I love you.

26:14.690 --> 26:17.326
(Sighs)

26:23.596 --> 26:26.635
"We'll appear before the proper
authorities to explain our actions"?

26:26.702 --> 26:28.203
Then what?

26:28.789 --> 26:30.952
(Sighs) Depends who
really sent the order.

26:30.953 --> 26:32.220
Well, I've been down in the crew's mess,

26:32.287 --> 26:33.254
and they're all looking at me,

26:33.321 --> 26:34.489
and I don't know what to say to them.

26:34.556 --> 26:36.324
You don't say anything.

26:36.391 --> 26:39.528
You show them how to be strong.

26:46.601 --> 26:50.205
If you had told me to, I
would've turned that key.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.342
Thank you for not making me.

26:58.513 --> 27:00.248
Mmm-mmm.

27:00.315 --> 27:01.449
(Keyboard keys clicking)

27:01.516 --> 27:02.651
(Woman speaking indistinctly on TV)

27:02.717 --> 27:04.052
Better than sex.

27:04.119 --> 27:06.288
Well, you're having the
wrong kind of sex.

27:06.354 --> 27:07.489
(Chuckles)

27:07.556 --> 27:08.990
(Chuckles)

27:09.057 --> 27:10.759
(Man) In breaking news,
Pakistan has attacked and sunk

27:10.825 --> 27:12.427
an American nuclear submarine...

27:12.494 --> 27:13.594
Do you see this?

27:13.714 --> 27:15.764
They're lying. That was
the American tomahawk.

27:15.830 --> 27:17.165
(Buzzes)

27:17.232 --> 27:19.134
(Alarm beeping)

27:19.201 --> 27:20.802
Call command.

27:20.869 --> 27:23.075
Command, this is NATO listening
post, Sainte Marina.

27:23.195 --> 27:26.007
We're reporting two tracks
originating in the Indian Ocean.

27:26.074 --> 27:27.576
Are we shooting at Pakistan?

27:27.642 --> 27:28.743
(Beeping continues)

27:28.810 --> 27:30.812
It's real.

27:33.281 --> 27:34.916
Oh, God.

27:34.983 --> 27:38.987
(Beeping continues)

27:39.054 --> 27:40.422
Can't you do anything?

27:40.488 --> 27:42.123
(Voice breaks) No. It's too late.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.326
Oh... (Cries)

27:44.392 --> 27:45.961
(Beeping continues)

27:46.027 --> 27:48.630
Sir, major shock waves on low frequency.

27:48.697 --> 27:50.699
Those are nukes going off near Pakistan.

27:50.765 --> 27:52.167
Okay.

27:52.234 --> 27:54.002
The fight's started.

27:54.434 --> 27:55.868
It's not too late to get into it.

27:55.935 --> 27:59.005
Sir, assault teams are ready.

27:59.072 --> 28:01.474
Let's grab some sunlight, people.

28:16.422 --> 28:20.193
(Rumbling)

28:25.064 --> 28:28.635
(People shouting indistinctly)

28:39.679 --> 28:40.813
Come on. Get 'em out of the streets!

28:40.880 --> 28:42.048
Get back!

28:42.115 --> 28:43.316
Get back! Get back!

28:43.383 --> 28:46.386
(Indistinct shouting continues)

28:54.894 --> 28:56.310
You speak English?

28:56.558 --> 28:57.454
Where's the hospital?

28:57.574 --> 29:01.067
The hospital? It's over there.

29:01.134 --> 29:02.468
(Indistinct shouting continues)

29:02.588 --> 29:05.238
James, take care of Gil. We got Hopper.

29:05.305 --> 29:08.341
(Indistinct shouting continues)

29:10.443 --> 29:12.478
I need a place to keep my friend

29:12.545 --> 29:14.614
until I can get him home.

29:16.349 --> 29:19.552
(Motor whirring)

29:25.560 --> 29:28.294
$1,000 U.S. cover it?

29:28.361 --> 29:30.063
(Exhales)

29:30.129 --> 29:33.066
Rest is to start a tab.

29:33.132 --> 29:35.501
Best scotch you have.

29:38.204 --> 29:39.272
(Man speaks indistinctly)

29:39.339 --> 29:41.374
Get down! Get down! Get down!

29:41.441 --> 29:43.309
Get down!
(Man) Nothing over here!

29:43.376 --> 29:44.310
(Man) All right. We're clear.

29:44.377 --> 29:45.945
Clear!

29:46.012 --> 29:47.313
(Man) All clear!

29:47.380 --> 29:48.945
Who are you?

29:49.065 --> 29:50.283
Talk to me, Cameron.

29:50.350 --> 29:51.417
Same interface as the "Colorado,"

29:51.484 --> 29:52.585
same software.

29:52.652 --> 29:54.120
Good. Get us eyes and ears.

29:54.187 --> 29:56.556
- We're clear.
- I don't know where you think you are,

29:56.623 --> 29:58.258
but this station belongs to NATO.

29:58.324 --> 29:59.459
(Chaplin) No.

29:59.525 --> 30:02.362
This station and that
sub parked outside,

30:02.428 --> 30:04.256
they all belong to me now.

30:06.607 --> 30:08.169
(Telephone rings)

30:08.512 --> 30:10.420
Admiral Shepard's office.

30:14.264 --> 30:15.832
Arthur, it's Marcus.

30:15.899 --> 30:18.201
Grace is right here.

30:20.069 --> 30:21.905
Dad, it's me.

30:21.971 --> 30:24.140
(Cries)

30:26.109 --> 30:29.045
(Sniffles) I thought I'd lost you.

30:29.112 --> 30:30.246
Dad...

30:30.313 --> 30:33.716
You always told me, honor before all.

30:33.783 --> 30:35.785
So...

30:35.852 --> 30:39.556
when you learn what happened...

30:39.622 --> 30:41.891
I hope you're proud of us.

30:44.561 --> 30:47.831
Arthur, we got fire orders
on the Antarctic Network.

30:47.897 --> 30:49.966
When we asked for confirmation,
the "Illinois" shot us up,

30:50.033 --> 30:51.668
damn near killed us.

30:51.734 --> 30:53.470
The White House said
it was the Pakistanis.

30:53.536 --> 30:55.038
We're at war.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.272
(Door opens)

30:57.273 --> 31:00.076
Arthur, are you there?

31:11.321 --> 31:12.622
(Clicks)

31:14.858 --> 31:18.761
I couldn't help but
notice an increase in...

31:18.828 --> 31:21.030
tourists today.

31:21.097 --> 31:22.432
Afraid I need to ask you your intentions

31:22.499 --> 31:25.435
towards my beautiful little island.

31:25.502 --> 31:28.338
My only intention is to
get fall-down drunk.

31:28.404 --> 31:31.241
Although you may have noticed
the guy invading the place.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.209
And when does this man plan on leaving?

31:33.276 --> 31:35.378
Wild guess...

31:35.445 --> 31:37.881
up until about an hour ago,

31:37.947 --> 31:40.216
you ran things here...

31:40.283 --> 31:42.085
drugs, guns, girls.

31:42.152 --> 31:44.662
Whatever it is, it's no match

31:44.782 --> 31:46.923
for the boomer floating in your harbor.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.691
You're done, friend.

31:50.460 --> 31:52.395
Ahh.

31:54.197 --> 31:56.666
I understand there might be some, uh,

31:56.733 --> 31:59.369
cultural differences here,

31:59.435 --> 32:01.871
so I'll translate.

32:01.938 --> 32:04.240
When someone where I'm
from calls you "friend,"

32:04.307 --> 32:06.709
they don't consider you one.

32:08.645 --> 32:10.835
This is my island.

32:12.315 --> 32:13.841
If I allow your presence,

32:13.961 --> 32:16.186
it comes with certain
terms and conditions.

32:16.252 --> 32:18.221
Is that clear...

32:18.288 --> 32:19.823
friend?

32:21.658 --> 32:23.827
He's first.

32:24.546 --> 32:25.991
He's the only real
shooter in your bunch,

32:26.111 --> 32:27.597
so the first bullet's his.

32:27.664 --> 32:29.532
Big fella's probably gonna
need two in the chest

32:29.599 --> 32:31.167
to make sure his fat ass goes down,

32:31.234 --> 32:32.899
so two he gets.

32:33.473 --> 32:34.607
And while dopey over there

32:34.674 --> 32:36.009
fumbles for his gun in
his back waistband,

32:36.075 --> 32:38.344
grumpy gets one between
the eyes, and so does he.

32:38.411 --> 32:40.647
You, though...

32:40.713 --> 32:42.815
Snow White...

32:42.882 --> 32:45.051
You I'm gonna shoot
clean through the neck.

32:45.739 --> 32:48.341
And that way, as the blood is
gushing out your choking throat

32:48.408 --> 32:50.377
and you desperately
beg me for your life,

32:50.443 --> 32:54.014
you won't be able to make a sound.

32:55.228 --> 32:56.831
Or... (Chuckles)

32:57.102 --> 32:59.861
You could leave me in
peace to enjoy my drink.

33:07.794 --> 33:10.030
(Huffs)

33:10.096 --> 33:13.266
Americans...

33:13.333 --> 33:15.569
Such confidence.

33:23.944 --> 33:26.813
(Telephone rings)

33:28.215 --> 33:29.349
(Ring)

33:29.416 --> 33:30.251
(Answering machine clicks)

33:30.271 --> 33:32.883
(Woman) Hi, you've reached Christine
and Sam. Please leave a message.

33:33.003 --> 33:34.123
(Beeps)

33:34.337 --> 33:36.389
(Kendal) Christine?

33:36.456 --> 33:37.724
Are you there, baby? It's me.

33:37.791 --> 33:39.726
Sam?

33:39.793 --> 33:41.969
Oh, my God. Sam? Sam, is that you?

33:42.081 --> 33:44.283
It's me, baby. It's me. I'm okay.

33:44.350 --> 33:45.818
Listen to me. I don't
know what you've heard,

33:45.885 --> 33:46.919
but I can explain it all.

33:46.986 --> 33:48.287
I just need to get home first.

33:48.354 --> 33:50.656
You were right, baby. I
never should've left you.

33:50.723 --> 33:52.091
No, no, no, no.

33:52.158 --> 33:53.259
None of that matters.

33:53.326 --> 33:55.228
Just come home to me, baby. Please.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.796
I will.

33:56.863 --> 33:57.997
I'm gonna get back.

33:58.064 --> 33:59.765
I'm gonna make it up to you. I promise.

33:59.832 --> 34:01.367
Just...

34:01.434 --> 34:03.436
Please believe in me.

34:05.271 --> 34:07.340
Please remember how much I love you.

34:07.406 --> 34:09.065
I love you, too.

34:09.185 --> 34:11.978
Whatever they say about me, you d...

34:12.043 --> 34:13.713
Sam? Sam!

34:13.779 --> 34:15.547
- Is this normal?
- No.

34:15.614 --> 34:16.782
Where's the power?

34:16.849 --> 34:19.851
(Chains tinkling)

34:21.154 --> 34:23.956
(Man) All their systems are offline.

34:24.023 --> 34:25.992
It's myself, Seaman
Stern, and the C.O.B.

34:26.058 --> 34:28.327
Yes, sir. They are blind.

34:28.393 --> 34:30.763
I don't know for how much longer.

34:30.830 --> 34:31.964
No, no need, sir.

34:32.031 --> 34:33.498
It's our duty.

34:33.565 --> 34:34.699
Step back, Lawrence.

34:34.766 --> 34:36.068
Put the gun down, Sam.

34:41.107 --> 34:43.275
I swear, I'll shoot you both.

34:49.710 --> 34:51.212
You cut the power, you called command,

34:51.279 --> 34:52.813
and you told them we'd be blind.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.250
We're all dead anyway.

34:54.370 --> 34:56.351
You just don't know it yet.

34:56.417 --> 34:57.719
Now get on your knees.

34:58.841 --> 35:00.038
On your knees!

35:00.158 --> 35:01.889
I'm not gonna let you do this.

35:01.956 --> 35:03.224
Sorry, Sam.

35:03.291 --> 35:06.861
You've always put too much
faith in the old man.

35:06.928 --> 35:08.830
Oh!
(Sophie gasps)

35:15.003 --> 35:17.639
What the hell did you just do?

35:19.674 --> 35:20.720
(Exhales)

35:20.842 --> 35:21.976
(Electricity whirs)

35:22.043 --> 35:23.778
(Cameron) The power's back. Rebooting.

35:24.824 --> 35:26.111
What have we got, Cameron?

35:26.231 --> 35:27.248
Whoa.

35:27.315 --> 35:28.221
Two birds heading our way.

35:28.341 --> 35:30.018
B-1 bombers. 15 minutes out.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.387
Get everyone back to the sub. Now.

35:33.888 --> 35:35.790
Bombers seven minutes out. Closing.

35:35.857 --> 35:37.525
All crew accounted for except two.

35:37.592 --> 35:39.193
We're short Brannan and Cortez.

35:39.260 --> 35:40.562
Find them. Prepare to dive.

35:40.628 --> 35:42.539
Delay that. We're not
leaving crew behind.

35:42.659 --> 35:44.265
And hiding in the ocean
is not gonna stop them

35:44.332 --> 35:46.935
from bombing this town and
all the people in it.

35:47.001 --> 35:49.604
No. We need to change the game.

35:49.671 --> 35:51.306
(Switch clicks)

35:51.372 --> 35:52.740
Weapons, conn.

35:52.807 --> 35:55.076
Spin up missile one.

35:55.143 --> 35:56.010
(Man) Conn, weapons.

35:56.077 --> 35:57.445
Missile one is loaded and ready.

35:57.512 --> 35:58.947
Coordinates set, sir.

35:59.013 --> 36:01.549
(Keys jangle)

36:03.585 --> 36:07.055
On my mark. Three, two, one.

36:07.121 --> 36:10.358
(Alarm dings)

36:10.425 --> 36:13.428
(Rumbling)

36:15.830 --> 36:17.065
(Missile roaring)

36:17.131 --> 36:19.534
That's not good.

36:19.601 --> 36:21.869
(Roaring continues)

36:21.936 --> 36:24.038
Bombers four minutes out.

36:24.707 --> 36:27.610
This is captain Marcus Chaplin
of the U.S.S. "Colorado."

36:27.677 --> 36:30.064
You have two bombers bearing
down on our position.

36:30.392 --> 36:33.683
In response, we have a
bird in flight toward D.C.

36:33.749 --> 36:35.306
I'm sure you're reading it.

36:35.436 --> 36:38.138
This is Curry. You're bluffing, Marcus.

36:38.205 --> 36:40.407
Initiate missile destruct immediately

36:40.474 --> 36:43.110
by order of the President
of the United States.

36:43.177 --> 36:44.845
Negative.

36:44.912 --> 36:47.373
If those bombers aren't turned
around within two minutes,

36:47.622 --> 36:51.018
you have my word, that
missile will detonate.

36:51.085 --> 36:53.128
"Colorado" out.

36:59.328 --> 37:01.598
(Monitors beeping)

37:01.856 --> 37:03.090
(Cameron) Bombers one minute out.

37:03.157 --> 37:05.659
Still coming. They're
not turning around.

37:07.695 --> 37:09.330
(Chuckles)

37:12.600 --> 37:14.769
Attention all hands,
this is your captain.

37:14.835 --> 37:19.040
Despite our best efforts,
an attack is imminent.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.975
We won't survive it.

37:21.042 --> 37:22.576
It's been my honor

37:22.643 --> 37:24.699
to have served with each
and every one of you.

37:27.373 --> 37:29.597
There's no one else I'd
rather be with right now.

37:32.153 --> 37:34.043
(Cameron) Missile passing
over Indiana, sir.

37:34.584 --> 37:36.131
Prepare to destruct missile.

37:36.251 --> 37:38.626
(Clatters)

37:38.693 --> 37:41.529
(Cameron) Bombers 30 seconds out.

37:41.595 --> 37:43.764
Guess that desk job will have to wait.

37:45.733 --> 37:48.536
I wasn't built for desks anyway, sir.

37:48.602 --> 37:50.078
On my mark,

37:50.198 --> 37:51.872
initiate missile destruct sequence.

37:51.939 --> 37:53.142
Three, two...

37:53.262 --> 37:55.543
Wait! The bombers are turning back!

37:55.609 --> 37:57.044
(Pants)

38:08.685 --> 38:11.631
"Colorado," this is Curry.
Bombers have disengaged.

38:11.751 --> 38:13.523
Initiate missile destruct now.

38:13.985 --> 38:15.892
Too late. You missed the
deadline by 90 seconds.

38:16.023 --> 38:17.424
Captain, put your key in

38:17.491 --> 38:20.431
and initiate missile
destruct sequence now.

38:20.551 --> 38:22.921
If they don't think we'll
back up our threats,

38:23.041 --> 38:24.255
we'll be dead in a week,

38:24.322 --> 38:26.257
along with everyone else in this town.

38:26.324 --> 38:28.713
They need to understand,
I'm a man of my word.

38:28.833 --> 38:31.467
Marcus... please.

38:33.841 --> 38:35.961
Have I ever done anything
other than what was

38:36.081 --> 38:38.117
in the best interest of
this boat, this crew,

38:38.237 --> 38:39.348
and our nation?

38:43.250 --> 38:47.021
(Roaring)

38:48.389 --> 38:52.159
(Booms)

38:55.697 --> 38:57.165
(Beeps)

38:57.232 --> 39:00.035
We have a good detonation, 200
miles east of Washington.

39:01.198 --> 39:04.540
That distance, no one will be hurt.

39:04.606 --> 39:07.109
But I'd say we got their attention.

39:14.170 --> 39:15.905
I'm captain Marcus Chaplin

39:15.972 --> 39:18.608
of the U.S.S. "Colorado."

39:18.674 --> 39:20.710
A short time ago, my
submarine was ordered

39:20.830 --> 39:23.697
to fire four nuclear
I.C.B.M.s at Pakistan.

39:23.817 --> 39:25.985
These orders came through a secondary,

39:26.105 --> 39:27.884
less secure network.
(Door opens)

39:27.950 --> 39:29.842
With millions of lives at stake,

39:30.587 --> 39:32.756
I requested confirmation
of the order be sent

39:32.876 --> 39:34.415
through the normal and proper channel.

39:35.646 --> 39:38.839
In response, an American attack sub,

39:38.934 --> 39:40.870
the U.S.S. "Illinois," fired on us

39:40.936 --> 39:42.505
and left my crew for dead

39:42.571 --> 39:45.307
at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.

39:45.374 --> 39:47.676
You little bitch, Grace.

39:47.743 --> 39:50.880
It's "You little bitch, lieutenant."

39:51.339 --> 39:53.241
From our submarine, we have watched

39:53.308 --> 39:54.543
as the fabric of trust

39:54.609 --> 39:57.145
between government and its
people has been torn.

39:57.550 --> 39:59.519
And when this boat dared to question

39:59.585 --> 40:01.888
why a nation without the capability

40:02.008 --> 40:04.857
to directly harm the homeland
was to be destroyed,

40:04.924 --> 40:06.893
elements of that
government tried to kill

40:06.959 --> 40:10.129
the 150 volunteer sailors on my boat.

40:10.196 --> 40:11.931
(Man) Sir, the intel is wrong!

40:11.998 --> 40:13.981
We...

40:14.320 --> 40:17.236
We killed the wrong people.

40:17.921 --> 40:19.839
(Curtain rings clatter)

40:19.906 --> 40:22.742
And then these same elements
continued on their course...

40:22.808 --> 40:24.243
(Knock on door) A first strike...

40:24.310 --> 40:25.176
It's open.

40:25.296 --> 40:26.962
Unprovoked.

40:27.775 --> 40:31.250
We have all borne witness.

40:32.089 --> 40:34.437
We have commandeered the
NATO early warning station

40:34.557 --> 40:36.435
on the island of Sainte Marina.

40:36.923 --> 40:38.758
From this facility, we
can see the movements

40:38.824 --> 40:40.413
of all the world's militaries.

40:40.635 --> 40:43.604
We are in control.

40:43.671 --> 40:45.198
I am declaring

40:45.318 --> 40:47.253
a 200-mile no-man's-land
around this island,

40:47.320 --> 40:49.255
effective immediately.

40:49.322 --> 40:51.023
As for myself

40:51.090 --> 40:53.996
and the men and women
of the U.S.S. "Colorado"...

40:54.116 --> 40:55.928
You see that?

40:55.995 --> 40:57.296
We love our country.

40:57.363 --> 40:59.065
That was my fault.

40:59.132 --> 41:00.967
I made that happen.

41:01.033 --> 41:04.286
We would gladly die for
what it represents.

41:04.406 --> 41:05.872
(Voice breaks) It was me. It was me.

41:05.938 --> 41:07.740
It was me.

41:07.807 --> 41:10.109
What did I do?

41:10.176 --> 41:12.889
But we do not recognize or obey

41:13.009 --> 41:15.120
a government that tries
to murder its own.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.332
If the current United States executive

41:17.452 --> 41:19.996
or any other nation
violates this perimeter,

41:20.103 --> 41:22.839
we have 17 more nuclear missiles aboard,

41:22.906 --> 41:24.474
and we will not hesitate

41:24.541 --> 41:26.743
to unleash fiery hell down upon you.

41:26.810 --> 41:29.261
I give you my word.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.748
Test us,

41:31.815 --> 41:35.815
and we will all burn...

41:36.186 --> 41:40.095
together.

41:41.723 --> 41:43.405
You've been warned.

41:48.416 --> 41:49.617
Cut it.

41:51.119 --> 41:52.353
(Camera beeps)

41:56.530 --> 41:58.280
Just crazy enough, sir.

42:22.784 --> 42:24.376
Repair crews found it.

42:25.234 --> 42:27.131
She's not easy to lose, is she?

42:28.690 --> 42:30.725
Thank you.

42:33.828 --> 42:35.838
What happened to the
country I grew up in?

42:36.865 --> 42:39.300
They've made it all a mess.

42:41.920 --> 42:45.340
We could do better, right here.

42:45.406 --> 42:46.908
Start from scratch.

42:49.707 --> 42:51.976
Everything we did was to
stay alive long enough

42:52.096 --> 42:54.582
to get our names cleared
and to get home.

42:59.052 --> 43:00.835
Maybe this is home now.
