WEBVTT

00:29.029 --> 00:31.596
IT'S ALL THERE.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.817
TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND
THE JACK NAPIER PAINTING.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.775
YOUR PAINTING IS BEING
HELD BY THE COLLECTIVE,

00:36.819 --> 00:38.299
PRIVATE CLUB
OF CONNOISSEURS

00:38.342 --> 00:40.605
OF OUTLAWED ARTWORK
AND ANTIQUITIES.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.868
YOU WANT TO TIE
THE ROOM TOGETHER

00:42.912 --> 00:45.523
WITH A VINTAGE CANVAS
THAT TAKES YOU

00:45.567 --> 00:48.526
INSIDE THE MIND
OF PSYCHOTIC CRIMINALITY?

00:48.570 --> 00:50.137
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.486
I WANT AN INTRODUCTION.

00:51.529 --> 00:53.183
OH. THE TOP CROW?

00:53.227 --> 00:55.272
YOUR BIGGEST CLIENTS
ARE IN THE COLLECTIVE.

00:55.316 --> 00:56.665
THEY PAY YOUR BILLS.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.580
YOU WALK UP
TO THEIR DOORSTEP

00:58.623 --> 01:00.190
TRYING TO GRAB
THAT NAPIER,

01:00.234 --> 01:02.192
THEY'RE GONNA ASK YOU
FOR A REFUND. UNH!

01:16.772 --> 01:19.427
YOU'RE FROM CORYANA.

01:19.470 --> 01:22.517
YOU'RE GONNA TELL SAFIYAH
TO GIVE MY DAUGHTER BACK.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.692
UNH!

01:27.043 --> 01:28.479
AAH!

01:34.485 --> 01:36.835
I GOT A REPORT
OF A GUY LURKING
AROUND EAST END

01:36.879 --> 01:38.315
WITH A SPIKY POLE.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.578
IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU,
BATWOMAN.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.885
THAT SO? BECAUSE HE'S
HANGING OFF MY LINE,

01:42.928 --> 01:45.148
SO WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT KIND
OF FISH I CAUGHT?

01:45.192 --> 01:47.803
THERE'S AN ITEM
I'M LOOKING FOR.

01:47.846 --> 01:50.240
IT'S GONNA HELP ME
FIND MY DAUGHTER.

01:50.284 --> 01:53.156
THE WOMAN HOLDING
HER CAPTIVE DOESN'T
WANT ME TO FIND IT.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.680
SAFIYAH?
SHE SENT THIS GUY?

01:55.724 --> 01:58.596
WEAPON FITS THE M.O.
OF HER ASSASSINS,

01:58.640 --> 02:01.730
BUT I'LL CONFIRM
AFTER YOU HAND HIM
OVER NOW.

02:01.773 --> 02:04.124
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS
FROM CROWS,

02:04.167 --> 02:07.605
AND I GOT A BETTER SHOT
AT FINDING KATE KANE
BEFORE YOU DO.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.133
"ALL CROWS
ARE BASTARDS."

02:25.275 --> 02:27.277
VESPER: MORNING, GOTHAM.
GUESS THE EARLY BIRD

02:27.321 --> 02:29.149
GIVES US THE BIRD.

02:29.192 --> 02:31.325
ACROBATIC ART PRANKSTER
WOLF SPIDER WAS AT IT AGAIN,

02:31.368 --> 02:33.370
ROLLING HIS EYES
AT THE ENTIRE CITY

02:33.414 --> 02:35.981
FROM THE TOP
OF THE GOTHAM CENTURY SKYSCRAPER

02:36.025 --> 02:37.983
WITH AN IRIDESCENT EMOJI,

02:38.027 --> 02:40.029
MILLENNIAL HACKTIVISM
AT ITS FINEST

02:40.072 --> 02:43.554
AND ALMOST ENOUGH TO DISTRACT US
FROM AN EVEN JUICIER BAT STORY.

02:43.598 --> 02:46.253
ANOTHER SIGHTING OF BATWOMAN 2.0

02:46.296 --> 02:48.603
AND TOP CROW
JACOB KANE TOGETHER,

02:48.646 --> 02:50.692
THIS TIME WORKING
IN THE EAST END CRIME SCENE.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.521
ARE WE LOOKING AT GOTHAM'S
NEWEST POWER COUPLE?

02:53.564 --> 02:56.088
NO. JEEZ.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.873
I THOUGHT BATWOMAN
WAS COOL.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.789
HEY. WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.313
MAYBE BATWOMAN
WAS SAVING HIS ASS.

03:03.357 --> 03:04.706
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY

03:04.749 --> 03:07.404
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S
RECONNECTING.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.101
STILL SLEEPY.

03:09.145 --> 03:12.061
I WISH YOU COULD DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

03:12.104 --> 03:15.282
YOU CAN TAKE
THE DAY OFF.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.284
MMM. I CAN'T.

03:17.327 --> 03:22.114
AS CUTE AS I LOOK
IN YOUR RIDICULOUS ROBE,

03:22.158 --> 03:24.595
I SHOULD GET HOME
AND CHANGE FIRST.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.728
YOU WALK OF SHAMING
FOR ME?

03:26.771 --> 03:30.601
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

03:30.645 --> 03:34.257
SPEAKING
OF THE OLD DAYS,

03:34.301 --> 03:37.478
IT'S TIME YOU GOT
THAT APOLOGY I OWE YOU.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.396
MY PARTYING WAS
OUT OF CONTROL,

03:42.439 --> 03:44.833
AND YOU TOOK MY STASH
THINKING IT WOULD HELP ME,

03:44.876 --> 03:48.619
AND INSTEAD, IT GOT
YOUR ASS THROWN IN JAIL,

03:48.663 --> 03:50.708
AND I GET WHY YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME TO VISIT YOU.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.624
YOU SERVED 18 MONTHS
FOR ME, RY,

03:53.668 --> 03:55.670
AND IT'S TIME I START
PAYING YOU BACK.

04:00.675 --> 04:03.286
ONE FOR YOU,
ONE FOR ME?

04:06.028 --> 04:08.030
I LOVE IT,

04:08.073 --> 04:09.640
BUT WE'RE GOOD.

04:09.684 --> 04:11.251
YOU GOT YOUR LIFE
TOGETHER.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.861
THAT'S ALL I WANTED.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.692
OHH! HEY.
WHAT IS THIS?

04:17.735 --> 04:19.171
IT'S..
A WORK INJURY.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.870
YOU FALL
ON A CORKSCREW?

04:21.913 --> 04:23.654
RYAN, YOU NEED TO GET
THAT LOOKED AT.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.395
YEAH. I JUST GOT
THIS JOB.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.876
I DON'T NEED MY BOSS
THINKING I CAN'T HACK IT.

04:27.919 --> 04:30.922
YOU TEND BAR.
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.838
ALL THESE YEARS LATER
STILL WORRYING ABOUT ME.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.710
IT'S KIND OF CUTE.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.320
-YOU KNOW WHAT'S KIND OF CUTE?
-HMM?

04:37.364 --> 04:39.714
YOU...

04:39.757 --> 04:43.413
WITHOUT THAT NASTINESS
ON YOUR SHOULDER.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.937
YOU TAKE CARE
OF EVERYONE ELSE.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.331
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
FOR ONCE.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.728
MARY: GIVING YOU
AN ANTIBIOTIC.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.121
SO...IT'S JUST
AN INFECTION?

04:56.165 --> 04:57.819
WELL, IT MIGHT HAVE
TURNED NECROTIC

04:57.862 --> 05:01.997
IF YOU HAD WAITED
ANY LONGER.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.826
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
HAVING ANY OTHER SYMPTOMS

05:04.869 --> 05:07.045
THAT YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME ABOUT?

05:07.089 --> 05:08.569
NO. I...

05:08.612 --> 05:11.789
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE
TIRED THAN NORMAL.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.356
OK. OK.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.753
KATE WOULD POP
TWO OF THESE,

05:18.796 --> 05:20.320
AND SHE'D BE BACK
IN FIGHTING SHAPE.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.496
-OK. COOL.
-BUT IF YOU'RE HURT,

05:22.539 --> 05:24.454
YOU SHOULD SIT OUT
A FEW DAYS.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.977
RIGHT. DID KATE
EVER SIT OUT?

05:26.021 --> 05:27.762
KATE WAS NEVER SHOT
WITH ANYTHING

05:27.805 --> 05:30.330
THAT PIERCED
THROUGH THE BATSUIT,

05:30.373 --> 05:33.158
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
COMPARE YOURSELF
TO HER.

05:33.202 --> 05:36.553
WHAT'S MY CHOICE, HUH?
EVERYBODY ELSE IS.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.686
I KNOW YOU
DON'T HAVE A TWITTER,

05:38.729 --> 05:41.732
SO I ASSUME
YOU MEAN LUKE.

05:41.776 --> 05:44.735
JUST DON'T TELL HIM
ABOUT THIS, OK?

05:44.779 --> 05:46.781
I DON'T NEED ANOTHER REASON
FOR HIM NOT TO TRUST ME.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.392
HE'S BEEN QUESTIONING
EVERY DECISION I MAKE.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.046
NOT TO BACKSEAT DRIVE,
BUT AREN'T YOU

05:51.089 --> 05:53.135
PROFICIENT IN 6
DIFFERENT FORMS
OF MARTIAL ARTS?

05:53.178 --> 05:54.702
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF JUST LEAVING
HIM HERE?

05:54.745 --> 05:56.965
I TOLD HIM WE WANTED
THE LOCATION OF CORYANA.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.532
HE'LL GIVE IT UP.
TAKE IT FROM A FOSTER KID.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.490
IT IS AMAZING HOW WELL
YOU BEHAVE

06:00.534 --> 06:01.970
WHEN YOU ARE
LITERALLY STARVING.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.624
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO WAIT HIM OUT.

06:03.667 --> 06:06.061
IF ALICE FINDS OCEAN
BEFORE WE FIND CORYANA,

06:06.104 --> 06:07.454
SAFIYAH'S GONNA GIVE
KATE TO HER,

06:07.497 --> 06:08.846
AND ALICE IS GOING
TO KILL HER.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.500
OK. SO DO YOUR
HACKER THING

06:10.544 --> 06:12.110
AND GET SOME INFO
ON THE SPIKY POLE GUY

06:12.154 --> 06:13.590
TO SPEED THIS UP.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.768
I ALREADY TRIED.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.291
I TRACKED HIS
MOVEMENTS
AND CONFIRMED

06:19.335 --> 06:21.119
THAT HE WASN'T
AFTER JACOB KANE.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.686
HE WAS STALKING THE GUY
THAT HE KILLED IN THE ALLEY,

06:22.730 --> 06:24.514
BUT THE VICTIM WAS
AN INVESTMENT ANALYST

06:24.558 --> 06:26.037
AT GOTHAM CAPITAL
WITH NO RECORD.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.475
WHAT'S HE GOT TO DO
WITH CORYANA?

06:28.518 --> 06:30.172
SIR, I'M NOT DEFENDING
HER ACTIONS,

06:30.215 --> 06:32.827
BUT MY GUESS IS SHE'S
AFTER WHAT WE'RE AFTER--

06:32.870 --> 06:34.350
KATE'S LOCATION.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.265
LET HER KEEP
SAFIYAH'S THUG.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.398
WE GOT A NEW LEAD
ON THE NAPIER--

06:38.441 --> 06:40.574
EVAN BLAKE,
OLD FRIEND OF KATE'S

06:40.617 --> 06:42.097
AND A FIXTURE
ON THE GOTHAM ART SCENE.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.055
JUST FLEW BACK
FROM A TRIP TO BERLIN.

06:44.099 --> 06:46.057
HE WAS CAUGHT
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

06:46.101 --> 06:48.930
WITH PLUNDERED ARTIFACT
AND FORCED TO PAY RESTITUTION.

06:48.973 --> 06:52.020
IN OTHER WORDS,
A LIKELY MEMBER
OF THE COLLECTIVE

06:52.063 --> 06:53.978
WHO MIGHT COOPERATE.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.720
EVAN: COMMANDER,
YOU'RE UNDERSELLING
OUR ENTIRE ORIGIN STORY.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.679
KATIE KANE SAVED
MY LIFE.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.811
-REALLY?
-GOTHAM PREP.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.465
IT'S EIGHTH GRADE,
AND THE WINTER FORMAL

07:02.509 --> 07:04.336
IS A MULTIVERSE
SHATTERING CRISIS

07:04.380 --> 07:06.382
BECAUSE
I'M "STRAIGHT."

07:06.426 --> 07:07.862
KATE WAS WAY OUT
BY THEN,

07:07.905 --> 07:09.516
I HAD THIS
TRAGIC CRUSH,

07:09.559 --> 07:11.387
AND I ASKED HER
TO THE DANCE.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.389
I'M SURE SHE WANTED
TO ROLL HER EYES
SO HARD,

07:13.433 --> 07:15.739
BUT WITH THE GRACE
OF A SAINT,

07:15.783 --> 07:17.393
SHE SAID YES.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.873
THE ONLY TIME YOU'LL
EVER HEAR TEENAGE KATE

07:18.916 --> 07:20.396
DESCRIBED AS A SAINT.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.919
MY PARENTS TAKE ME
TO PICK HER UP,

07:21.963 --> 07:23.443
AND KATE IS
JAW-DROPPING

07:23.486 --> 07:26.271
IN THIS TAILORED
VELVET SUIT,

07:26.315 --> 07:28.317
JUST RADIATING
QUEER CONFIDENCE.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.841
I ON THE OTHER HAND
DISSOLVE INTO
A MONSOON OF TEARS.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.669
KATE RACES ME UP
TO HER BEDROOM,

07:32.713 --> 07:34.149
AND WE GO THROUGH
THE WHOLE THING.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.194
"I'M GAY."
"I KNOW."

07:36.238 --> 07:37.892
WE MAKE IT
TO THE DANCE,

07:37.935 --> 07:40.198
AND I CAME OUT
BY DEFAULT

07:40.242 --> 07:42.418
BECAUSE I WORE KATE'S
ALEXANDER McQUEEN

07:42.462 --> 07:44.159
OFF-THE-SHOULDER
MINI,

07:44.202 --> 07:46.509
WHICH BEGGED
A LOT OF QUESTIONS,

07:46.553 --> 07:49.381
BUT I WASN'T
AFRAID ANYMORE.

07:49.425 --> 07:52.036
I WAS GLOWING,

07:52.080 --> 07:55.997
AND THEN KATE
DITCHED ME TO MAKE OUT
WITH MAGGIE WATSON.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.260
SOUNDS LIKE OUR GIRL.

07:58.303 --> 08:01.742
SO YOU NEED MY HELP
WITH KATE'S DISAPPEARANCE.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.308
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.223
KATE WAS LOOKING
FOR A PIECE
OF ARTWORK,

08:05.267 --> 08:07.051
SOMETHING THAT MAY
HAVE GOTTEN HER

08:07.095 --> 08:08.749
ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF SOMEONE
VERY DANGEROUS.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.620
OUR THEORY IS
IF WE FIND THE ITEM

08:10.664 --> 08:12.230
IT WILL LEAD US
TO HER CAPTOR.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.494
WELL, YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT ART SNOB.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.235
I WAS SENIOR EDITOR
AT THE GOTHAM MUSEUM
OF ANTIQUITIES,

08:17.279 --> 08:19.324
I CURATE MY OWN
PRIVATE COLLECTIONS,

08:19.368 --> 08:22.023
I'VE GOT MY HANDS
IN A BIT OF EVERYTHING.

08:22.066 --> 08:25.156
YEAH. WE KNOW.
AGENT MOORE.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.898
KATE WAS LOOKING
FOR A CANVAS PAINTED
BY JACK NAPIER,

08:27.942 --> 08:29.421
ALIAS THE JOKER.

08:29.465 --> 08:30.901
YOU'RE AWARE
OF IT, YES?

08:30.945 --> 08:32.860
I KNOW THE LEGEND.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.905
PSYCHOTIC EVILDOER
BREAKS INTO HOME,

08:34.949 --> 08:37.299
SPLASHES HOMEOWNER'S
GUTS ALL OVER SOME
OLD PAINTING

08:37.342 --> 08:40.215
IN THE FOYER
AND CALLS IT
MODERN ART.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.825
IT'S A BIT ON THE NOSE
IF YOU ASK ME.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.219
NOT TO MENTION
ILLEGAL TO BUY,
SELL, OR POSSESS

08:44.262 --> 08:47.004
SINCE IT WAS STOLEN
FROM AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.745
I'M SORRY.
SHOULD THERE BE
A HARSH LIGHT

08:48.789 --> 08:51.226
SHINING IN MY EYES
RIGHT NOW?

08:51.269 --> 08:54.708
BECAUSE THE KATE
I KNEW NEVER GAVE
A CRAP ABOUT ART,

08:54.751 --> 08:56.623
AND I HAVEN'T SPOKEN
WITH HER IN YEARS.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.886
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE AFFILIATED

08:58.929 --> 09:01.366
WITH THE COLLECTIVE.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.716
HEH.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.108
WE'LL WORK TO GET YOU
FULL IMMUNITY

09:04.152 --> 09:05.719
IF YOU HELP US
MAKE CONTACT.

09:05.762 --> 09:08.417
IMMUNITY FROM WHAT,
MS. MOORE?

09:08.460 --> 09:09.940
I'M A PERFECT ANGEL.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.986
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HERE FRIEND.

09:12.029 --> 09:15.598
I LOVE KATIE,
BUT THIS FEELS LIKE ENTRAPMENT.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.687
IF YOU NEED TO CONTACT
ME AGAIN,

09:17.731 --> 09:19.733
I'LL REFER YOU
TO MY LAWYERS.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.916
I WANT ALL OUR TECH
INSIDE EVERY DEVICE
EVAN OWNS,

09:28.959 --> 09:31.919
ROUND-THE-CLOCK
REVOLVING TAILS.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.921
YES, SIR,
BUT THERE COULD BE

09:33.964 --> 09:36.140
AN EASIER WAY
TO LOCATE CORYANA--

09:36.184 --> 09:38.186
WITH BATWOMAN'S HELP.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.536
LET ME ASK HER
FOR ACCESS TO HER PRISONER.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.494
BATWOMAN
OR WHOEVER IT IS

09:42.538 --> 09:44.148
WHO STEPPED IN
FOR MY DAUGHTER,

09:44.192 --> 09:46.629
I AM NOT GONNA GROVEL
AT HER FEET.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.022
THEN LET ME DO IT
