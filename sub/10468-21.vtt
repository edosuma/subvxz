00:01.995 --> 00:03.895
Bailey: IT'S
THE ONLY SOLUTION, WILL.

00:03.915 --> 00:05.180
WELL, NOT TO ME.

00:05.180 --> 00:06.877
WHAT IF THE I.N.S. GUY
DROPS BY AGAIN?

00:06.877 --> 00:07.965
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT,
WILL.

00:07.965 --> 00:09.053
I CAN'T KEEP TELLING HIM
YOU'RE AT WORK

00:09.053 --> 00:10.924
OR VISITING YOUR PARENTS
OR SOMETHING.

00:10.924 --> 00:12.596
I MEAN, THAT'S THE STUFF
THEY LOOK FOR.

00:12.606 --> 00:14.136
YEAH. YOU'VE
GOT TO BE THERE.

00:14.156 --> 00:15.502
WILL, YOU'VE GOT
TO BE LIVING THERE.

00:15.502 --> 00:17.192
WELL, I LIKE
LIVING HERE.

00:17.192 --> 00:20.064
[SCOFFS]
YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

00:20.064 --> 00:22.744
WITH A WASHING
MACHINE THAT CLANKS

00:22.774 --> 00:25.198
AND ONE TINY LITTLE WINDOW
AND NO FRESH AIR?

00:25.208 --> 00:26.984
YEAH, BUT
I'M ALL SETTLED HERE.

00:26.984 --> 00:28.464
WHERE THE HELL
ARE MY PANTS?

00:28.464 --> 00:29.856
HERE.

00:31.293 --> 00:32.772
THANK YOU.

00:34.426 --> 00:36.428
WELL, IS IT
A PRIVACY ISSUE?

00:36.428 --> 00:37.995
ABOUT NOT HAVING
SEPARATE ROOMS?

00:37.995 --> 00:40.867
WELL, PRIVACY IS--
IS A FACTOR, YES. SO--

00:40.867 --> 00:42.608
Bailey: SO WE COULD TOTALLY
WORK THAT OUT.

00:42.608 --> 00:45.176
IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE MEREDITH COME
OVER OR WHATEVER,

00:45.176 --> 00:46.830
THEN HOLLY COULD
JUST SPEND THE NIGHT OVER HERE.

00:46.830 --> 00:48.527
OK, THAT'S ANOTHER THING.

00:48.527 --> 00:50.007
WHAT IS MEREDITH GONNA SAY
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT

00:50.007 --> 00:51.182
I'M MOVING IN
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN?

00:51.182 --> 00:53.097
Bailey: NOTHING. YOU JUST
EXPLAIN IT TO HER.

00:53.097 --> 00:54.098
I DON'T KNOW.

00:54.098 --> 00:55.491
IT JUST--IT FEELS...

00:55.491 --> 00:58.800
WILL, HANG ON.
I DON'T GET IT, MAN.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.191
I DON'T GET IT.

01:00.191 --> 01:02.628
HOLLY'S PLACE
IS SO MUCH NICER THAN THIS.

01:02.628 --> 01:04.065
IT'S CLOSER
TO WHERE YOU WORK,

01:04.065 --> 01:05.979
AND IT'S THE BEST WAY TO KEEP
THE I.N.S. HAPPY,

01:05.979 --> 01:07.285
WHICH YOU WERE
SO WORRIED ABOUT BEFORE.

01:07.285 --> 01:10.332

WHAT GIVES?

01:11.811 --> 01:13.770
I'LL THINK
ABOUT IT, OK?

01:57.535 --> 02:00.451
THAT REPORTER LADY HAS CALLED,
LIKE, 15 TIMES.

02:00.451 --> 02:02.801
IGNORE HER, CLAUD.
I'M NOT CALLING HER BACK.

02:02.801 --> 02:04.412
I CAN'T IGNORE HER.
EVERY TIME I PICK UP THE PHONE,

02:04.412 --> 02:05.848
SHE BEEPS IN.

02:05.848 --> 02:09.241
WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO TALK TO HER?

02:09.242 --> 02:12.202
SHE WANTS TO INTERVIEW ME
FOR SOME ONLINE MAGAZINE.

02:12.202 --> 02:13.856
SHE READ MY BOOK ONLINE,

02:13.856 --> 02:16.249
SHE THINKS I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO HER READERS.

02:16.249 --> 02:17.555
WELL, MAYBE YOU DO.

02:17.555 --> 02:20.689
CLAUD,
SHE THINKS I'M SOME PILLAR OF STRENGTH,

02:20.689 --> 02:21.994
BECAUSE I STOOD UP TO NED

02:21.994 --> 02:23.909
THAT I'M SOME ROLE MODEL.

02:23.909 --> 02:26.259
SO? YOU ARE, A LITTLE.

02:26.259 --> 02:27.826
CLAUDIA, LOOK AT ME.

02:27.826 --> 02:30.220
I HAVE BEEN MOPING AROUND
IN MY SWEATS FOR, LIKE, DAYS.

02:30.220 --> 02:33.049
BECAUSE WHY? WHY? BECAUSE ADAM IS GONE.

02:33.049 --> 02:35.952
BECAUSE MY MAN WENT AWAY.
I AM NOT A ROLE MODEL.

02:35.972 --> 02:37.469
JULIA,
I THOUGHT HALF THE POINT OF THIS BOOK

02:37.469 --> 02:38.620
WAS HELPING PEOPLE.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.622
LOOK, I KNOW, OK?

02:40.622 --> 02:43.320
I WILL CALL HER BACK EVENTUALLY,
JUST NOT NOW.

02:43.320 --> 02:45.714
I'M TOO BUSY BEING DISGUSTED WITH MYSELF

02:45.714 --> 02:46.845
TO BE STRONG FOR ANYONE ELSE.

02:46.845 --> 02:49.021
ANY IDEA HOW LONG THAT MIGHT TAKE?

02:49.021 --> 02:50.240
WHY?

02:50.240 --> 02:51.991
SHE HAS A DEADLINE IN 2 DAYS.

02:52.001 --> 02:53.069
SO?

02:53.069 --> 02:55.376
SO I, UH...

02:55.376 --> 02:57.636
KIND OF MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER.

02:57.686 --> 02:59.421
SHE'S COMING BY LATER TODAY.

02:59.501 --> 03:00.632
CLAUDIA!

03:00.632 --> 03:02.199
WHAT? YOU CAN CANCEL.

03:02.199 --> 03:04.157
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO CALL HER.

03:09.685 --> 03:12.427
SO, HON, FOR THE BABY'S ROOM,

03:12.427 --> 03:13.950
PRIMARY COLORS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

03:13.950 --> 03:15.560
THE MOST STIMULATING.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.563
BUT THEN THERE'S PATTERNS VERSUS SOLIDS,

03:18.563 --> 03:20.826
BRUSHED COTTON VERSUS CHENILLE.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.524
I DON'T KNOW.

03:22.524 --> 03:25.744

KIND OF YOUR SPECIALTY.

03:25.744 --> 03:27.964
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, SO I'M OFF.

03:27.964 --> 03:29.400
GONNA GO MEET MY FRIENDS FOR HAPPY HOUR,

03:29.400 --> 03:31.881
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BE OUT ALL NIGHT.

03:31.881 --> 03:33.883
ALL NIGHT, SO DON'T WAIT UP, OK?

03:33.883 --> 03:34.884
WE WON'T. WE WON'T.

03:34.884 --> 03:36.668
HAVE FUN. YEAH, HAVE FUN.

03:36.668 --> 03:38.148
YEAH, 'CAUSE I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW,

03:38.148 --> 03:39.715
THAT LUKE COULD BE FINDING US

03:39.715 --> 03:41.238
AN APARTMENT BACK IN DALLAS ANY DAY NOW,

03:41.238 --> 03:43.588
AND I'D HAVE TO GO STRAIGHT BACK THERE,
YOU KNOW, SO--

03:43.588 --> 03:45.373
SO THIS IS MY NIGHT TO GET CRAZY.

03:45.373 --> 03:46.983
SO I'M GONNA GO OUT AND CUT IT UP

03:48.332 --> 03:50.595

03:50.595 --> 03:52.945
WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE...

03:54.730 --> 03:57.298
OK. ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHY, OK?

03:57.298 --> 03:59.474
BECAUSE I COME BACK INTO TOWN

03:59.474 --> 04:01.084
AND I CALL DUSTY, RIGHT? AND SHE GOES,

04:01.084 --> 04:03.347
"OH, HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WIPEOUT?"

04:03.347 --> 04:04.566
OH, THAT STUFF'S GREAT.

04:04.566 --> 04:06.394
IT GETS RID OF THAT POOPY SMELL LIKE THAT.

04:06.394 --> 04:10.006
NO, IT'S A SONG, KIRSTEN.

04:10.006 --> 04:11.616
IT'S A DANCE REMIX.

04:11.616 --> 04:13.923
IT'S BEEN IN ALL THE CLUBS FOR,
LIKE, WEEKS.

04:13.923 --> 04:17.318
AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS A DIAPER PAIL DEODORIZER.

04:17.318 --> 04:18.928
OH.

04:18.928 --> 04:20.451
YEAH, SO, THE MISSION IS,

04:20.451 --> 04:22.018
IS THAT I'M GONNA GO OUT FOR ONE NIGHT

04:22.018 --> 04:24.673
AND I'M GONNA BE
MY OWN PERSON WITH HER OWN LIFE

04:24.673 --> 04:30.243
WITH SOMETHING ON HER MIND
BESIDES BABY, BABY, BABY.

04:30.243 --> 04:33.812
UM, SO, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING TONIGHT?

04:36.685 --> 04:37.903
SO I'LL SEE YOU GUYS TONIGHT, RIGHT?

04:37.903 --> 04:40.210
YEAH. TONIGHT?

04:40.210 --> 04:41.646
TONIGHT'S THE PREMIERE

04:41.646 --> 04:44.083
OF ROB MAGGIO'S ORCHESTRAL PIECE,
REMEMBER?

04:44.083 --> 04:46.085
OAKLAND EAST BAY SYMPHONY?

04:46.085 --> 04:48.131
THAT'S TONIGHT?

04:48.131 --> 04:49.393
WHY? YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

04:49.393 --> 04:51.352
NO. OF COURSE I WANT TO GO.

04:51.352 --> 04:56.182
I JUST HAVE THIS
MONSTER SHAKESPEARE PAPER TO WRITE.

05:00.273 --> 05:01.797
AFTER THE CONCERT.

05:01.797 --> 05:03.668
I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 7:00.

05:03.668 --> 05:05.183
OK.

05:14.984 --> 05:16.812
YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT SCHOOL AND SESSIONS,

05:16.812 --> 05:18.596
AND, YOU KNOW, HE STILL MANAGES

05:18.596 --> 05:20.598
TO GO OUT EVERY NIGHT.

05:20.598 --> 05:21.773
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

05:21.773 --> 05:23.514
I MEAN, COLLEGE,
THAT'S GOTTA BE EVEN HARDER.

05:23.514 --> 05:24.515
OH, I KNOW.

05:24.515 --> 05:27.213
THANK GOD FOR THE WEB, RIGHT?

05:27.213 --> 05:28.563
YOU MEAN FOR RESEARCH?

05:28.563 --> 05:30.478
I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

05:30.478 --> 05:32.958
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

05:32.958 --> 05:34.220
JUST THAT, UM,

05:34.220 --> 05:36.397
THE WEB HAS EVERYTHING YOU COULD NEED,

05:36.397 --> 05:38.616
EVEN MONSTER SHAKESPEARE PAPERS

05:38.616 --> 05:40.096
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO WRITE.

05:40.096 --> 05:41.402
I CAN'T DO THAT.

05:41.402 --> 05:42.446
WHY NOT?

05:42.446 --> 05:43.839
[SIGHS] GEE, I DON'T KNOW,

05:43.839 --> 05:45.362
BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL?

05:45.362 --> 05:47.712
BECAUSE IT'S CHEATING?

05:47.712 --> 05:49.627
I MEAN, NOT TO MENTION THE FACT

05:49.627 --> 05:50.889
THAT I WOULDN'T LEARN ANYTHING.

05:50.889 --> 05:53.414
LOOK, IT'S JUST LIKE RESEARCH.

05:53.414 --> 05:56.460
THE IDEAS ARE THERE, BUT YOU STILL GOTTA
PUT THEM IN YOUR OWN WORDS.

05:58.027 --> 06:01.247
BESIDES, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LEARN?

06:01.247 --> 06:03.641
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW EVERYTHING ALREADY.

06:07.645 --> 06:09.734
ACTUALLY, SIR,

06:09.734 --> 06:11.344
IS 9,000 PEOPLE.

06:11.344 --> 06:13.738
BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO MAKE YOU 9,001.

06:13.738 --> 06:16.219
SIR? HELLO?

06:16.219 --> 06:17.394
HE HUNG UP.

06:17.394 --> 06:19.178
THEY ALL DO. THAT'S MY JOB NOW,

06:19.178 --> 06:20.919
BEING A PROFESSIONAL
DISAPPOINTMENT TO PEOPLE.

06:20.919 --> 06:22.965
AND MY PARENTS SAID
I COULDN'T MAKE A LIVING THAT WAY.

06:22.965 --> 06:26.055
SO, YOU GOT THE TIME TO GRAB
A CUP OF COFFEE?

06:26.055 --> 06:29.101
UH, CAN'T.
GOTTA WORK. SORRY.

06:29.101 --> 06:31.190
WHAT'S UP?

06:31.190 --> 06:33.845
NOTHING MUCH.

06:33.845 --> 06:35.847
JUST WANTED TO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU.

06:35.847 --> 06:38.546
JUST ANSWERING PHONES,
DISAPPOINTING THE MASSES--

06:38.546 --> 06:40.373
WITH YOU AND HOLLY.

06:40.373 --> 06:43.028
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:43.028 --> 06:45.640
WILL...

06:45.640 --> 06:47.816
YOU MADE IT PAINFULLY CLEAR
THIS MORNING

06:47.816 --> 06:49.252
THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO MOVE IN WITH HER,

06:49.252 --> 06:51.167
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S
TONS OF REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD.

06:51.167 --> 06:54.649
AND SO I ASKED MYSELF
WHY THAT MIGHT BE,

06:54.649 --> 06:59.001
AND THE REASON SEEMS
PRETTY OBVIOUS.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.177
LOOK, WHATEVER
YOU'RE THINKING--

07:01.177 --> 07:03.832
YOU DON'T LIKE HER,
DO YOU?

07:03.832 --> 07:05.660
WHAT?

07:05.660 --> 07:06.791
IT'S OBVIOUS, WILL.

07:06.791 --> 07:08.445
YOU DON'T TALK
TO HER,

07:08.445 --> 07:09.838
YOU BARELY EVEN
LOOK AT HER.

07:09.838 --> 07:11.492
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE EVER
SINCE THE WEDDING,

07:11.492 --> 07:13.668
WHEREVER SHE IS,
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE.

07:13.668 --> 07:14.799
BAILEY,
BUT WAIT, THAT'S--

07:14.799 --> 07:16.453
BECAUSE
SHE LIKES YOU, MAN.

07:16.453 --> 07:18.020
SHE LIKES YOU
A LOT.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.066
SO SHE DID SOMETHING
THAT UPSET YOU--

07:21.066 --> 07:23.329
LISTEN, NO.
THAT'S NOT--

07:23.329 --> 07:25.897
I LIKE HER, TOO.
I--REALLY, I DO.

07:25.897 --> 07:27.943
YOU DO?
WELL, SO THEN,

07:27.943 --> 07:30.119
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:30.119 --> 07:32.687
LOOK, WHY CAN'T IT
JUST BE THE REASONS I GAVE YOU?

07:32.687 --> 07:35.167
BECAUSE WE'RE
FRIENDS HERE, WILL.

07:35.167 --> 07:39.041
YOU COULD TELL ME
THE TRUTH, IT'S OK.

07:41.173 --> 07:44.481
UNLESS--UNLESS
YOU THINK IT'S ME,

07:44.481 --> 07:45.830
LIKE I DON'T
WANT YOU THERE.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.310
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT,

07:47.310 --> 07:50.443
THEN YOU COULDN'T
BE FARTHER OFF BASE. HONEST.

07:50.443 --> 07:54.273
WILL,
WE LOVE YOU, MAN.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.624
COME ON,
WE WANT YOU AROUND.

07:56.624 --> 08:01.933
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING, OK?

08:01.933 --> 08:05.546
JUST AGREE YOU'LL
MOVE IN THERE.

08:07.156 --> 08:10.420
UNLESS--AM I WRONG?
IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?

08:11.508 --> 08:13.031
NO.

08:13.031 --> 08:14.685
NOTHING.

08:14.685 --> 08:16.252
OK.

08:18.515 --> 08:22.824
[MUSIC PLAYING]

08:28.133 --> 08:29.439
[BREATHLESS]
OH, MY GOD.

08:29.439 --> 08:31.049
ARE YOU
HAVING FUN YET?

08:31.049 --> 08:32.224
WHAT?

08:32.224 --> 08:33.530
ARE YOU HAVING FUN?

08:33.530 --> 08:36.054
OXYGEN, OXYGEN.
FUN?

08:36.054 --> 08:37.665
YOU WANTED TO COME OUT
AND CUT LOOSE

08:37.665 --> 08:38.840
AND TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME,

08:38.840 --> 08:39.884
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE HAVING--

08:39.884 --> 08:41.756
NO, I HATE THEM!

08:41.756 --> 08:44.019
I HATE THEM. THEY KEEP DANCING,
THEY KEEP DANCING,

08:44.019 --> 08:45.281
AND THEY
NEVER GET TIRED.

08:45.281 --> 08:47.065
WELL, IT'S 'CAUSE
THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS, DAPH.

08:47.065 --> 08:48.414
NO, THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE FACT

08:48.414 --> 08:49.415
THAT I'M NOT
STRIPPING ANYMORE.

08:49.415 --> 08:51.026
THIS HAS TO DO
WITH THIS HORMONE

08:51.026 --> 08:52.984
THAT JUST ENTERED
MY BLOODSTREAM

08:52.984 --> 08:54.072
WHEN I STARTED
BREAST-FEEDING.

08:54.072 --> 08:55.552
IT'S THE SAME HORMONE
MAKES ME, LIKE,

08:55.552 --> 08:58.163
SPARK TO TOPICS
LIKE SPIT-UP.

08:59.512 --> 09:00.818
[SIGHS] MAYBE I CAN
COUNTERACT THIS

09:00.818 --> 09:02.646

18:27.297 --> 18:29.865
TODD, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:29.865 --> 18:32.868
OH, I'M JUST LUCKY
IS ALL.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.394
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE--

18:37.394 --> 18:39.831
MAYBE I NEED THAT
STUDY BREAK AFTER ALL.

18:39.831 --> 18:41.703
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR REWRITE?

18:41.703 --> 18:43.705
WHAT ABOUT IT?

18:47.970 --> 18:51.365
SO, PROGRAM IS,

18:51.365 --> 18:53.715
YOU ENTERTAIN MARTINE
WHILE I WORK ON CHUCK.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.107
I MEAN, IT
SHOULD BE A BREEZE.

18:55.107 --> 18:57.327
AS LONG
AS I DON'T NOD OFF

18:57.327 --> 18:58.807
WHEN SHE STARTS
HER GARDENING TALK.

18:58.807 --> 19:01.723
HEY, COME ON,
YOU LOVE THAT STUFF.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.378
SHE TALKED YOU
INTO THAT HYDROGEN PLANT

19:04.378 --> 19:05.770
THAT YOU KILLED
THAT ONE TIME.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.032
HYDRANGEA.

19:07.032 --> 19:08.860
AND I DIDN'T KILL IT,
I DRIED IT,

19:08.860 --> 19:10.949
WHICH MAKES FOR
A VERY NICE DISPLAY

19:10.949 --> 19:12.777
FOR A FLOWERING--

19:12.777 --> 19:16.128
ANYWAY, THAT
WASN'T MY POINT.

19:16.128 --> 19:17.869
MY POINT WAS,

19:17.869 --> 19:19.393
MAYBE WE'D
HAVE A LOT MORE FUN

19:19.393 --> 19:22.831
IF WE JUST DIDN'T GO
TO SOME RESTAURANT, YOU KNOW?

19:22.831 --> 19:24.006
I MEAN, DAPHNE
AND HER FRIENDS,

19:24.006 --> 19:25.050
THEY'RE GOING
TO THIS OTHER THING,

19:25.050 --> 19:27.052
THIS CRAZY
ROCK THEATER THING.

19:27.052 --> 19:29.794
[SIGHS] KIRSTEN,
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.928
ROCK THEATER
WITH CHUCK AND MARTINE?

19:32.928 --> 19:36.105
OK, OK, YOU DON'T THINK THAT THEY
WOULD HAVE FUN,

19:36.105 --> 19:39.021
BUT I MEAN, YOU
MAY BE SURPRISED.

19:39.021 --> 19:41.110
MAYBE THEY'RE DREADING
THIS SIT-DOWN DINNER THING

19:41.110 --> 19:42.242
JUST AS MUCH AS WE ARE.

19:42.242 --> 19:44.635
BUT, KIRSTEN,
ROCK THEATER?

19:44.635 --> 19:46.942
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
YOU'D WANT TO DO THAT.

19:46.942 --> 19:49.423
LIKE I SAID,
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

19:49.423 --> 19:52.077
WELL, LISTEN, I MEAN,
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL,

19:52.077 --> 19:55.342
THEN GREAT.
YOU AND ME, WE'LL GO OUT

19:55.342 --> 19:57.082
AND GET CRAZY SOME NIGHT.

19:57.082 --> 20:00.260
YEAH, LIKE THAT'LL
EVER HAPPEN.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.652
IT WILL.

20:01.652 --> 20:04.264
JUST NOT TONIGHT.

20:06.527 --> 20:08.877
UH, JUST A MINUTE,
I'M COMING.

20:15.362 --> 20:16.363
HEY.

20:16.363 --> 20:17.494
HEY.

20:17.494 --> 20:20.062
I'M SORRY. DID--DID I GET
THE TIME WRONG?

20:20.062 --> 20:21.455
TIME? WHAT TIME IS IT?

20:21.455 --> 20:24.414
8:30. WELL, TOMORROW
IS MY DEADLINE, OR I WOULDN'T--

20:24.414 --> 20:26.155
OH, WOW,
IT'S 8:30 ALREADY?

20:26.155 --> 20:27.330
MMM.

20:27.330 --> 20:29.114
WOULD TOMORROW
MORNING BE BETTER?

20:29.114 --> 20:30.246
IT LOOKS LIKE
I JUST WOKE YOU UP.

20:30.246 --> 20:32.204
YEAH. YOU KNOW, UM,

20:32.204 --> 20:33.858
WOULD THAT BE OK?
TOMORROW?

20:33.858 --> 20:35.556
NO PROBLEM.
WHAT TIME?

20:35.556 --> 20:38.254
OH, UH,
TOMORROW IS WHAT?

20:38.254 --> 20:39.299
JULIA...

20:39.299 --> 20:40.952
WHAT'S IN THAT
LEFTOVER THAI FOOD?

20:43.564 --> 20:44.652
OH, SORRY.

20:44.652 --> 20:46.393
HI.

20:49.439 --> 20:51.833
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL CALL YOU.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.313
PHOEBE, WAIT.

20:59.493 --> 21:01.190
Holly: EVERYONE SEEMS
TO BE BLAMING THE MEDIA,

21:01.190 --> 21:03.148
BUT IT SAYS JUST AS MUCH
ABOUT THE WOMEN,

21:03.148 --> 21:06.891
PARADING AROUND ON TELEVISION LIKE
BEAUTY CONTESTANTS.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.023
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE ABOUT LOVE,

21:08.023 --> 21:10.068
NOT THE LOTTERY.

21:10.068 --> 21:11.461
I MEAN, MEREDITH,
DON'T YOU AGREE?

21:11.461 --> 21:12.723
YEAH.

21:12.723 --> 21:14.551
BUT--BUT HOW IS THAT
ANY DIFFERENT FROM REAL LIFE?

21:14.551 --> 21:16.727
PEOPLE MEET LIKE THAT
ALL THE TIME

21:16.727 --> 21:18.425
AT PARTIES
AND AT BARS...

21:18.425 --> 21:20.078
ON BLIND DATES.

21:20.078 --> 21:21.645
THAT'S HOW YOU GUYS MET,
ISN'T IT?

21:21.645 --> 21:22.864
YEAH.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.300
YEAH.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.084
SO YOU AGREED TO
GO OUT WITHOUT KNOWING EACH OTHER AT ALL?

21:26.084 --> 21:27.347
AND YOU HIT IT OFF.

21:27.347 --> 21:29.392
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE TOGETHER.

21:29.392 --> 21:30.741
RIGHT?

21:32.047 --> 21:33.527
RIGHT?

21:34.571 --> 21:35.746
I'M SORRY.

21:35.746 --> 21:39.446
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

21:39.446 --> 21:42.274
DID YOU TELL THEM
WE WERE STILL DATING?

21:42.274 --> 21:43.928
NO.

21:43.928 --> 21:48.063
NO, NOT--THEY JUST SAID
THEY WANTED TO SEE YOU,

21:48.063 --> 21:50.326
SO I--I SET IT UP.

21:53.547 --> 21:55.679
YEAH. SORRY.

21:55.679 --> 21:58.334
YOU--YOU JUST KEPT
SAYING "YOU GUYS"

21:58.334 --> 22:00.205
LIKE WE WERE
TOGETHER, AND--

22:00.205 --> 22:02.599
OH.

22:02.599 --> 22:06.342
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO STOP
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION.

22:06.342 --> 22:08.388
HA. IT'S OK.

22:08.388 --> 22:09.693
AHEM!

22:09.693 --> 22:13.697
YOU KNOW, I-I'M GOING
TO GO TO THE LADIES' ROOM.

22:13.697 --> 22:15.220
IT'S BACK THAT WAY.

22:17.875 --> 22:21.836
WILL, YOU AND
MEREDITH SPLIT UP?

22:22.924 --> 22:24.404
WHEN DID THAT
HAPPEN?

22:24.404 --> 22:25.535
I DON'T KNOW.

22:25.535 --> 22:27.189
A WEEK AGO MAYBE.

22:27.189 --> 22:29.191
YOU COULD'VE SAID NO
TO TONIGHT

22:29.191 --> 22:33.543
IF IT WAS GOING TO BE
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU.

22:33.543 --> 22:34.892
WHY?

22:34.892 --> 22:37.373
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE, WILL.

22:37.373 --> 22:40.245
OH, YOU DON'T.

22:40.245 --> 22:42.030
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

22:42.030 --> 22:45.555
LOOK, I DON'T BELONG HERE.

22:45.555 --> 22:47.601
OK? CAN WE JUST
ADMIT THAT, PLEASE?

22:47.601 --> 22:49.907
I MEAN, I DID THIS WHOLE
MARRYING HOLLY THING

22:49.907 --> 22:52.257
SO THAT SHE WOULD BE ABLE
TO STAY HERE WITH YOU,

22:52.257 --> 22:53.781
NOT WITH ME.

22:53.781 --> 22:55.826
WELL, NO ONE'S
SAYING--

22:55.826 --> 22:58.438
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD
TO MAKE ME FEEL COMFORTABLE HERE,

22:58.438 --> 23:00.265
BUT I'M REALLY NOT.

23:00.265 --> 23:02.006
WILL, HANG ON A SECOND.

23:02.006 --> 23:05.140
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:05.140 --> 23:07.621
THE ONLY THING WORSE
THAN BEING IN THIS POSITION

23:07.621 --> 23:10.450
IS PRETENDING
THAT I'M NOT, SO PLEASE.

23:12.060 --> 23:14.279
I'M GOING
TO GO GET MEREDITH.

23:14.279 --> 23:15.933
YOU GUYS JUST STAY HERE
AND HANG OUT WITH EACH OTHER,

23:15.933 --> 23:17.979
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.633
SO JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT.

23:35.475 --> 23:37.607
OH, MY GOD!

23:39.304 --> 23:41.959
NOW I KNOW WHAT DRACULA
MUST'VE FELT LIKE.

23:41.959 --> 23:44.614
I GUESS YOU GUYS
HAD FUN LAST NIGHT, HUH?

23:44.614 --> 23:46.703
YEAH. THANKS.

23:46.703 --> 23:48.052
A LITTLE
TOO MUCH FUN.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.490
OK, A LOT
TOO MUCH FUN.

23:50.490 --> 23:52.404
WHAT DID YOU GUYS
DO LAST NIGHT?

23:53.493 --> 23:55.843
OH, KIRSTEN!

23:55.843 --> 23:56.974
SORRY.

23:56.974 --> 23:58.846
WHAT, SOMETHING BAD
HAPPEN OR SOMETHING?

23:58.846 --> 24:00.108
NO, NOTHING BAD HAPPENED.

24:00.108 --> 24:01.109
NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL.

24:01.109 --> 24:03.415
A BIG GIANT NOTHING.

24:03.415 --> 24:05.461
DINNER WITH CLIENTS.

24:10.466 --> 24:13.077
AND SO
DID YOU GUYS DANCE?

24:13.077 --> 24:14.775
MM-HMM.

24:14.775 --> 24:15.776
STAYED OUT LATE?

24:15.776 --> 24:18.256
HMMM!

24:18.256 --> 24:21.433
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD
A COUPLE DRINKS.

24:21.433 --> 24:23.087
YOU MISSED NOTHING.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.132
I'M TELLING YOU.

24:24.132 --> 24:26.351
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN
FEELING ALL THIS TIME

24:26.351 --> 24:27.788
LIKE I WAS MISSING OUT.

24:27.788 --> 24:30.355
YOU KNOW, NOT BEING HERE
AND GETTING WILD WITH MY FRIENDS,

24:30.355 --> 24:34.142
BUT I REALLY
MISSED NOTHING.

24:34.142 --> 24:37.406
EXCEPT WATCHING THEM PICK UP ON GUYS
THEY REALLY DON'T LIKE

24:37.406 --> 24:39.756
AND PAYING WAY TOO MUCH
FOR DRINKS THAT I REALLY DON'T NEED

24:39.756 --> 24:45.457
AND COTTON MOUTH
AND JACK-HAMMER HEAD AND DRY HEAVES.

24:45.457 --> 24:46.850
UGH!

24:48.765 --> 24:53.378
I JUST NEED A HIT OFF THAT BEAUTIFUL
DAUGHTER OF MINE.

24:55.206 --> 24:56.512
HEY.

24:56.512 --> 24:58.558
WHAT IS
THAT FACE?

24:58.558 --> 25:01.517
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU HAD IT ONCE.

25:01.517 --> 25:04.085
AT LEAST YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE NOT MISSING.

25:59.096 --> 26:00.271
UH, PHOEBE?

26:00.271 --> 26:02.404
[KNOCKS ON DESK]

26:02.404 --> 26:03.623
EXCUSE ME.

26:03.623 --> 26:04.754
OH. HI.

26:04.754 --> 26:09.063
HI. YOU IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING?

26:09.933 --> 26:11.282
NO.

26:12.806 --> 26:14.677
WHAT'S UP?

26:14.677 --> 26:18.681
UH, LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
YOU MUST BE THINKING...

26:18.681 --> 26:19.987
ABOUT ME AND JUSTIN.

26:19.987 --> 26:22.990
UM, AND I JUST
WANTED TO MAKE SURE,

26:22.990 --> 26:24.905
IF PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO BE READING ABOUT ME,

26:24.905 --> 26:26.776
IF I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
SOME KIND OF EXAMPLE,

26:26.776 --> 26:30.040
I'D RATHER BE
A GOOD ONE, YOU KNOW.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.477
SEE, THE THING IS
IT--WHAT HAPPENED IS

26:32.477 --> 26:35.524
THAT JUSTIN
CAME OVER TO THE HOUSE,

26:35.524 --> 26:37.308
AND HE WAS
PRACTICALLY IN TEARS,

26:37.308 --> 26:40.529
AND--I KNOW-- MAYBE THAT SEEMS LAME
THAT I LET THAT--

26:40.529 --> 26:44.489
HA HA--AFFECT ME, BUT
HE WAS REALLY UPSET.

26:44.489 --> 26:47.275
HE WAS REALLY UPSET.
HE AND HIS WIFE, THEY TALKED,

26:47.275 --> 26:50.452
AND THEY REALIZED THEY MADE
THIS HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

26:50.452 --> 26:54.412
YEAH, THAT--THAT
SOUNDS SAD, BUT--

26:54.412 --> 26:56.458
NO. ACTUALLY, SEE,

26:56.458 --> 26:57.807
I LISTENED TO HIM,

26:57.807 --> 27:01.028
AND ALL OF THE STUFF
THAT I WAS ANGRY ABOUT--

27:01.028 --> 27:03.204
IT JUST
KIND OF FADED AWAY.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.554
AND I REALIZED
THAT MEANS SOMETHING.

27:05.554 --> 27:06.555
JULIA--

27:06.555 --> 27:09.689
AND I KNOW IT
SOUNDS CLICHE, BUT...

27:09.689 --> 27:12.822
ONE THING LED
TO ANOTHER AND, UH...

27:14.824 --> 27:17.044
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

27:17.044 --> 27:20.874
I MEAN, THIS ARTICLE
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

27:20.874 --> 27:22.136
NO, I KNOW THAT.

27:22.136 --> 27:25.182
I JUST--I--
I SAW YOUR EXPRESSION WHEN YOU LEFT,

27:25.182 --> 27:28.708
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT IT MUST LOOK LIKE.

27:28.708 --> 27:32.407
YOU KNOW, HOW--HOW WEAK
I MUST SEEM OR WHATEVER.

27:32.407 --> 27:34.191
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

27:34.191 --> 27:37.586
BUT IT'S JUST--

27:37.586 --> 27:40.197
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE SO SURE
ABOUT BEING WITH THIS GUY,

27:40.197 --> 27:44.158
THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO DO SO MUCH EXPLAINING?

27:47.248 --> 27:48.684
I'LL BE HONEST.

27:48.684 --> 27:51.208
I DREAD TEACHING THIS PLAY
EVERY YEAR.

27:51.208 --> 27:54.734
TEACHING ROMEO AND JULIET
TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

27:54.734 --> 27:57.258
ALWAYS SEEMS TO BRING OUT
THE WORST IN THEM.

27:57.258 --> 28:01.305
THE AMBITIOUS ONES
RENT THE LEO MOVIE,

28:01.305 --> 28:04.134
BUT MOST OF YOU
HAVEN'T EVEN READ IT,

28:04.134 --> 28:07.224
LET ALONE HAD AN ORIGINAL
THOUGHT TO CONTRIBUTE.

28:07.224 --> 28:09.226
CLAUDIA.

28:10.750 --> 28:12.403
THIS IS
COLLEGE LEVEL WRITING.

28:12.403 --> 28:14.579
YOU KNOW THAT,
DON'T YOU?

28:15.711 --> 28:17.060
IT IS?

28:19.019 --> 28:20.760
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

28:22.631 --> 28:24.764
NOW, AS FOR
THE REST OF YOU,

28:24.764 --> 28:28.245
THIS WEEK'S TEST IS ON
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.

28:28.245 --> 28:32.249
I SUGGEST YOU ACTUALLY
READ THIS ONE, PEOPLE.

28:38.952 --> 28:39.953
HEY.

28:39.953 --> 28:42.738
HEY!

28:42.738 --> 28:45.088
OH, SO, WHAT YOU THINK?

28:45.088 --> 28:46.133
OH, YOU WERE GREAT!

28:46.133 --> 28:47.787
IT WAS--YOU WERE SO...

28:47.787 --> 28:50.528
WOW! YOU HAD THAT AUDIENCE
IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.

28:50.528 --> 28:51.703
SO TO SPEAK.

28:51.703 --> 28:53.053
WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE?

28:53.053 --> 28:55.620
ALL THOSE GUYS CHEERING
AND YOU'RE JUST...

28:55.620 --> 28:56.970
DOING YOUR THING.

28:56.970 --> 29:00.800
IN COMPLETE CONTROL, LIKE
YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE THEM.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.671
OOH, I NOTICED THEM.

29:02.671 --> 29:05.805
THERE WAS ONE GUY IN THE CORNER
PUTTING ON A SHOW ALL OF HIS OWN.

29:07.110 --> 29:09.896
HEY. UM, ARE THOSE
YOUR COSTUMES?

29:09.896 --> 29:11.636
OH, YEAH. THEY'RE
MY OWN DESIGNS.

29:11.636 --> 29:13.638
I MAKE A LITTLE MONEY ON THE SIDE
SELLING THEM TO THE OTHER GIRLS.

29:13.638 --> 29:16.032
GO AHEAD. TAKE A LOOK.

29:16.032 --> 29:17.860
MAYBE YOU WANT
TO BUY ONE.

29:17.860 --> 29:19.557
PUT A LITTLE SPICE
IN YOUR MARRIAGE.

29:19.557 --> 29:20.863
HEY, KIRSTEN, HOW ABOUT
WE GET GOING, OK?

29:20.863 --> 29:22.604
DUSTY, IT WAS GREAT
SEEING YOU,

29:22.604 --> 29:24.954
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE SORT OF BRINGS
BACK ALL THE WRONG MEMORIES.

29:24.954 --> 29:26.564
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

29:26.564 --> 29:29.654
OR MAYBE YOU WANT
TO GIVE THE STAGE A TRY.

29:29.654 --> 29:32.614
OK, WHAT?
KIRSTEN DANCING?

29:32.614 --> 29:34.572
THE GIRL'S GOT SOME MOVES.
I'VE SEEN THEM.

29:34.572 --> 29:37.140
HA HA! OK, NO.
NO, WAIT, KIRSTEN,

29:37.140 --> 29:40.056
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
CONSIDERING THIS, ARE YOU?

29:42.102 --> 29:43.799
KIRSTEN.

29:43.799 --> 29:46.236
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
OK, THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

29:46.236 --> 29:50.284
ALL RIGHT, DUSTY, YOU WILL NOW HELP ME
TALK HER OUT OF THIS,

29:50.284 --> 29:52.155
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO DO THIS, DOES SHE?

29:52.155 --> 29:55.419
I DON'T KNOW.
DOES SHE?

30:00.947 --> 30:02.165
IT'S WEIRD.

30:02.165 --> 30:04.167
WE'VE BEEN APART
FOR SO LONG,

30:04.167 --> 30:06.517
AND THEN NOW,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

30:06.517 --> 30:08.171
TO BE BACK TOGETHER
JUST LIKE THAT, I--

30:08.171 --> 30:09.651
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.

30:09.651 --> 30:10.652
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:10.652 --> 30:12.959
I HAVE TO SAY
I FEEL GOOD.

30:12.959 --> 30:15.875
I MEAN,
IT FEELS RIGHT.

30:15.875 --> 30:17.050
YOU KNOW?

30:17.050 --> 30:20.792
DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU,
JUSTIN, AT ALL,

30:20.792 --> 30:23.752
JUST HOW EASY IT WAS?

30:23.752 --> 30:27.930
I MEAN, I--I SAW YOU AND
I FELL INTO BED WITH YOU.

30:27.930 --> 30:29.279
YEAH, SO?
I MEAN--

30:29.279 --> 30:30.628
WELL, DOESN'T THAT
SEEM STRANGE?

30:30.628 --> 30:33.457
I MEAN, NO DISCUSSION,
NO CONVERSATION.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.024
ABOUT WHAT?

30:35.024 --> 30:36.330
I DON'T KNOW.
ABOUT ALL OF THAT STUFF--

30:36.330 --> 30:38.288
LAURA, THE LAST
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

30:38.288 --> 30:39.376
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:39.376 --> 30:40.812
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
ALL NIGHT LONG.

30:40.812 --> 30:42.771
ABOUT YOUR SIDE,
NOT ABOUT MINE.

30:42.771 --> 30:45.121
OK, FINE.
MORE PAIN. GO AHEAD.

30:45.121 --> 30:47.210
NO, I'M--I'M
SERIOUS, JUSTIN.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.257
YOU PUT ME THROUGH HELL.

30:50.257 --> 30:52.389
YOU ASKED ME WHETHER I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD GET MARRIED,

30:52.389 --> 30:54.391
AND WHEN I FINALLY
DECIDED TO BE HONEST,

30:54.391 --> 30:55.915
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
GOING TO GET MARRIED ANYWAY.

30:55.915 --> 30:57.307
THEN YOU ASKED ME
TO BREAK UP YOUR WEDDING.

30:57.307 --> 31:00.006
OK. LOOK,
I TOLD YOU I WAS WRONG.

31:00.006 --> 31:03.574
I WAS CONFUSED,
AND I MADE A MISTAKE.

31:03.574 --> 31:06.403
LOOK, WHERE IS THIS
ALL COMING FROM?

31:06.403 --> 31:10.364
2 DAYS AGO, YOU WERE READY
TO LET ALL OF THIS GO.

31:10.364 --> 31:13.062
JUSTIN, LOOK
AT WHAT WE'RE DOING.

31:13.062 --> 31:16.761
WE'RE JUMPING INTO BED TOGETHER BECAUSE
WE'RE BOTH ON THE REBOUND,

31:16.761 --> 31:18.589
AND WE'RE AVOIDING THE PAIN.

31:18.589 --> 31:19.895
IT'S US, THOUGH.

31:19.895 --> 31:23.290
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
WE WANT TO BE TOGETHER, RIGHT?

31:23.290 --> 31:24.944
WANT TO BE OR NEED TO BE?

31:24.944 --> 31:27.337
WELL, WHO CARES?

31:27.337 --> 31:28.435
WELL, I DO.

31:28.465 --> 31:30.455
I DO, 'CAUSE
IT FEELS BAD, JUSTIN.

31:30.475 --> 31:31.907
IT FEELS WEAK.

31:31.907 --> 31:35.737
JULIA, WHY DO WE HAVE TO PICK
EVERYTHING APART?

31:35.737 --> 31:40.568
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE
TRYING TO TALK YOURSELF OUT OF THIS.

31:40.568 --> 31:43.832
YEAH, WELL, BETTER THAT
THAN ME TRYING TO TALK MYSELF INTO IT.

31:50.230 --> 31:52.319
[FOOTSTEPS]

31:57.977 --> 32:00.327
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

32:00.327 --> 32:01.850
HEY. NOT MUCH.

32:06.637 --> 32:07.987
HOLLY SAID YOU HADN'T
COME BY HER PLACE ALL DAY TODAY.

32:07.987 --> 32:10.467
NO. YOU KNOW,
MY STUFF IS ALL THERE,

32:10.467 --> 32:12.643
SO IF ONE OF THOSE AGENTS
COMES BY, SHE CAN CALL ME,

32:12.643 --> 32:14.645
AND I'LL TAKE A CAB AND SAY I WAS OVER
AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

32:14.645 --> 32:15.820
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS,
WILL.

32:15.820 --> 32:17.300
IT'S NOT
GOING TO WORK THAT WAY.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.041
LOOK, I DON'T
WANT TO BE THERE.

32:19.041 --> 32:20.869
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT WHY?

32:20.869 --> 32:22.218
WHY? WHAT IS
GOING ON WITH YOU?

32:22.218 --> 32:23.959
I TOLD YOU
10 TIMES NOW.

32:23.959 --> 32:25.178
YEAH, BUT
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

32:25.178 --> 32:26.657
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT.

32:26.657 --> 32:29.660
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,
WILL, AND HOLLY IS NUTS ABOUT YOU.

32:29.660 --> 32:30.661
YOU KNOW THAT.

32:30.661 --> 32:32.011
JUST STOP.

32:37.929 --> 32:39.496
WILL.

32:41.672 --> 32:45.285
I TRIED SO HARD TO STOP THIS FROM
HAPPENING, BAY, I DID.

32:45.285 --> 32:47.722
AT FIRST I TRIED
NOT TO FEEL IT,

32:47.722 --> 32:48.940
AND WHEN
THAT DIDN'T WORK,

32:48.940 --> 32:50.203
I TRIED NOT TO MOVE IN.

32:50.203 --> 32:52.814
I TRIED NOT TO BE
WHERE I'D HAVE TO BE TEMPTED.

32:52.814 --> 32:54.381
TEMPTED?
WHAT ARE YOU--

32:54.381 --> 32:55.817
LOOK, IT HAPPENS.

32:55.817 --> 32:57.993
OK? YOU MEET SOMEONE.
YOU SPEND TIME WITH SOMEONE.

32:57.993 --> 32:59.168
LOOK. HOLD ON.
YOU'RE LOSING ME HERE.

32:59.168 --> 33:00.474
AND I WOULD'VE
IGNORED IT.

33:00.474 --> 33:01.997
I WOULD'VE JUST LET IT
WEAR OFF, YOU KNOW,

33:01.997 --> 33:07.872
BUT WE'RE ALWAYS TOGETHER.
YOU KEEP PUSHING US BOTH TOGETHER.

33:07.872 --> 33:10.875
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE NOT SAYING--

33:16.229 --> 33:18.709
WILL.

33:18.709 --> 33:20.929
COME ON.

33:20.929 --> 33:23.540
I KNOW. I KNOW
IT'S MESSED UP, OK,

33:23.540 --> 33:25.542
BUT I DIDN'T
WANT IT TO HAPPEN.

33:25.542 --> 33:27.066
BUT IT
DID HAPPEN.

33:27.066 --> 33:30.199
DIDN'T IT?

33:30.199 --> 33:32.680
BAY, COME ON.
YOU THINK I CAN CONTROL THAT?

33:32.680 --> 33:34.725
OF COURSE,
YOU CAN, WILL.

33:34.725 --> 33:36.684
YOU DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

33:36.684 --> 33:38.381
YOU DON'T
EVEN CONSIDER IT.

33:38.381 --> 33:42.733
HOW?! WHEN MY JOB IS TO STUDY
THIS WOMAN LIKE HOMEWORK, HOW?!

33:42.733 --> 33:44.213
YOU FIND A WAY.

33:44.213 --> 33:47.434
IF YOU WANT TO BE
SOMEBODY'S FRIEND, WILL,

33:47.434 --> 33:49.740
YOU FIND A WAY.

33:59.054 --> 34:01.578
[WALKING
UP THE STAIRS]

34:06.279 --> 34:08.063
LET'S SEE.

34:08.063 --> 34:10.196
"CLIMAX FOR 2,

34:10.196 --> 34:12.850
BRUNETTE ON THE INSIDE."

34:12.850 --> 34:14.330
HERE IT IS.

34:14.330 --> 34:16.158
"I KNOW WHO I AM."

34:16.158 --> 34:21.163
OH. WELL, JUST, UM, SCAN IT AND
LOOK FOR MY NAME.

34:22.033 --> 34:23.861
HMMM, NOT PAGE ONE...

34:23.861 --> 34:27.300
NOT PAGE 2...

34:27.300 --> 34:29.824
NO. NOPE, NOWHERE.

34:29.824 --> 34:32.566
IT SEEMS TO BE
ALL ABOUT UTA PFLUG.

34:32.566 --> 34:33.958
WHO'S UTA PFLUG?

34:33.958 --> 34:35.656
A FEMALE BODY BUILDER.

34:35.656 --> 34:37.875
LOOKS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.094
OH, YEAH?

34:39.094 --> 34:41.923
WHAT DOES SHE
HAVE TO SAY?

34:41.923 --> 34:43.490
YADDA, YADDA, YADDA,
"MS. HEMISPHERE."

34:43.490 --> 34:45.144
OK. HERE.

34:45.144 --> 34:48.451
"I TOLD HIM I LOVED HIM,

34:48.451 --> 34:49.931
"BUT IF HE HAD TO BE
WITH MORE WOMEN THAN ME,

34:49.931 --> 34:51.324
"I WAS DRAWING THE LINE.

34:51.324 --> 34:52.760
THERE'D BE NO MORE MISTAKES."

34:52.760 --> 34:54.283
WAIT. "NO MORE"?

34:54.283 --> 34:57.112
SHE TOOK BACK THIS GUY
WHO CHEATED ON HER?

34:57.112 --> 34:58.635
YEAH, APPARENTLY.

34:58.635 --> 35:01.682
WHAT DOES THE MAGAZINE
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

35:03.336 --> 35:05.251
"UTA PFLUG BREAKS THE RULES.

35:05.251 --> 35:06.817
"SHE FORGIVES AND FORGETS,

"BUT SHE TEACHES US THERE'S MORE THAN
ONE KIND OF STRENGTH--

35:09.124 --> 35:10.604
"THE STRENGTH
TO REMAKE THE RULES

35:10.604 --> 35:12.780
WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO US."

35:12.780 --> 35:15.217
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I DID,
AND THEY CUT ME OUT OF THE ARTICLE.

35:17.437 --> 35:21.310
WHY IS IT STRONG FOR HER
AND WEAK FOR ME?

35:21.310 --> 35:24.400
OOH, YOU SHOULD
SEE THESE PECS.

35:27.664 --> 35:28.926

35:28.926 --> 35:30.754
IN HERE.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.497
HEY.

35:34.497 --> 35:35.498
HEY.

35:35.498 --> 35:38.458
WHAT'S UP?
YOU'RE IN BED READING?

35:38.458 --> 35:43.506
OH, YEAH. IT'S JUST BEEN
KIND OF A LONG DAY.

35:43.506 --> 35:46.161
OK.

35:48.859 --> 35:52.385
BUT, UM, I GOT THOSE TICKETS
TO THAT ROCK THEATER THING.

35:52.385 --> 35:54.822
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO GO OUT TONIGHT

35:54.822 --> 35:56.215
AND PAINT THE TOWN.

35:56.215 --> 36:00.088
HMM. WELL, WE COULD.

36:00.088 --> 36:02.046
KIRSTEN, THIS WAS
IMPORTANT TO YOU,

36:02.046 --> 36:03.570
TO GET
OUT OF THE HOUSE

36:03.570 --> 36:06.007
AND GET WILD
OR WHATEVER.

36:06.007 --> 36:07.704
I MEAN, YOU GOT ME
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

36:07.704 --> 36:13.014
I KNOW. I JUST-- WELL, I JUST SORT
OF CHANGED MY MIND.

36:14.407 --> 36:15.712
OK.

36:18.062 --> 36:20.761
SO WHAT DO YOU FEEL
LIKE DOING,

36:20.761 --> 36:22.066

36:34.340 --> 36:38.039
I'LL GO RUN THE TUB.

36:38.039 --> 36:39.301
OK.

36:45.873 --> 36:47.701
HOW ABOUT BUBBLES?

36:47.701 --> 36:49.050
SOUNDS GREAT.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.774
HEY.

37:17.774 --> 37:19.559

TO BE AT A SESSION?

37:25.695 --> 37:27.349
FRALEY SAID YOU CANCELED
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

37:27.349 --> 37:30.265
I MEAN, I THOUGHT SOMETHING
MIGHT BE WRONG.

37:30.265 --> 37:32.180
YOU CAME ALL THE WAY
OVER HERE?

37:32.180 --> 37:35.488
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:35.488 --> 37:38.012
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

37:38.012 --> 37:42.190
THIS IS GOING
TO SOUND SO STUPID.

37:42.190 --> 37:44.714
I FAILED MY MUCH ADO EXAM.

37:44.714 --> 37:45.933
WHAT?

37:45.933 --> 37:47.587
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY FAIL IT.

37:47.587 --> 37:50.372
I DIDN'T SHOW UP.

37:50.372 --> 37:53.375

FOR THE PAPER THAT I--

37:54.420 --> 37:55.551
ANYWAY...

37:55.551 --> 37:59.033
I CAN'T DO THIS
ANYMORE, TODD.

AND SESSIONS AND CONCERTS

38:03.864 --> 38:05.431
AND PARTIES
AND AFTER-PARTIES.

38:05.431 --> 38:08.129
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

38:08.129 --> 38:10.044
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT,

38:10.044 --> 38:14.701
BUT SOMEHOW YOU MANAGE
TO DO EVERYTHING AND BE EVERYWHERE.

38:14.701 --> 38:17.443
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S
LIKE PART OF ME IS SCARED

38:17.443 --> 38:20.837
THAT IF I DON'T KEEP UP
WITH YOU...

38:20.837 --> 38:22.491
I'LL BE LEFT BEHIND.

38:23.971 --> 38:26.539

THAT WOULD SOUND STUPID.

38:31.457 --> 38:35.286
SO I GUESS
YOU HAVE TO STUDY, HUH?

38:36.287 --> 38:37.593
YEAH.

38:42.990 --> 38:45.122
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:48.517 --> 38:51.259
I'M STUDYING, TOO.

38:51.259 --> 38:53.392
BUT, TODD,
WHAT ABOUT THE SESSION?

38:53.392 --> 38:55.437
YOU DON'T
WANT TO MISS IT.

38:55.437 --> 38:58.092
YOU KNOW, FOR
A REALLY SMART PERSON,

38:58.092 --> 39:00.834
YOU'RE NOT VERY SMART
SOMETIMES.

39:00.834 --> 39:02.052
WHAT?

39:02.052 --> 39:04.228
CLAUDIA, THE ONLY THING
I DON'T WANT TO MISS

39:04.228 --> 39:07.057
IS BEING WITH YOU.

39:08.755 --> 39:12.106
HOW COULD YOU
NOT KNOW THAT BY NOW?

39:21.202 --> 39:24.945
NO, IT'S THE 25-YARD LINE,
BUT YOU'RE CLOSE TO THE FIELD.

39:24.945 --> 39:27.774
NOW, I CAN GET YOU
NEAR THE 50-YARD LINE--

39:29.166 --> 39:31.734
LISTEN,
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

39:31.734 --> 39:32.996
THANKS.

39:33.910 --> 39:35.825
HEY.

39:35.825 --> 39:37.218
HI.

39:41.831 --> 39:44.791
HOLLY SAID YOU DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT.

39:44.791 --> 39:47.881
YEAH, WELL,
CONSIDERING...

39:47.881 --> 39:50.057
I SPENT THE NIGHT
WITH MY PARENTS.

39:50.057 --> 39:52.625
WILL--

39:52.625 --> 39:54.844
LISTEN.

39:54.844 --> 39:57.891
I FEEL
INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE.

39:57.891 --> 40:02.591
OK? FOR LYING, FOR TELLING YOU,
GOD, FOR LETTING IT HAPPEN.

40:02.591 --> 40:05.638
WILL, STOP. OK?

40:05.638 --> 40:07.988
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.424
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

40:09.424 --> 40:10.730
OK?

40:10.730 --> 40:13.733
I MEAN, HOW COULD I
NOT UNDERSTAND THIS?

40:13.733 --> 40:16.170
I'M CRAZY ABOUT HER.

40:16.170 --> 40:21.175
RIGHT? SO WHY WOULDN'T
ANYBODY ELSE BE?

40:22.219 --> 40:24.265
SO YOU'RE NOT MAD?

40:24.265 --> 40:27.311
NO, I'M NOT MAD.

40:27.311 --> 40:29.879
DOES SHE KNOW?

40:29.879 --> 40:31.228
UH-UH.

40:31.228 --> 40:33.753
NOW I HAVE TO TELL HER.

40:33.753 --> 40:35.537
WHY?

40:35.537 --> 40:39.933
WELL, SHE'S GOT TO KNOW WHY I'M SUDDENLY
NOT LIVING WITH HER ANYMORE.

40:39.933 --> 40:42.065
BUT YOU ARE.

40:42.936 --> 40:44.677
WHAT? EXCUSE ME?

40:44.677 --> 40:47.897
YOU ARE LIVING
WITH HER, WILL.

40:47.897 --> 40:49.246
YOU'RE MARRIED.

40:49.246 --> 40:52.032
YOU HAVE TO LIVE THERE.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

40:52.032 --> 40:55.383
BUT, BAILEY, I MEAN,
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL HERE.

40:55.383 --> 40:58.560
LOOK,
THAT'S...WHATEVER.

40:58.560 --> 40:59.822
I TRUST YOU.

40:59.822 --> 41:01.650
YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO ME.

41:01.650 --> 41:04.218
THE POINT IS
THIS IS PAINFUL FOR ME.

41:04.218 --> 41:05.872
WELL, WILL,
I UNDERSTAND THAT,

41:05.872 --> 41:08.701
BUT THERE'S--
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

41:08.701 --> 41:11.138
WHAT ARE YOU--

41:12.269 --> 41:13.619
WILL...

41:14.924 --> 41:18.362
YOU GOT MARRIED.

41:18.362 --> 41:20.103
YOU STOOD
IN FRONT OF A JUDGE

41:20.103 --> 41:21.627
AND GOT MARRIED.

41:21.627 --> 41:23.454
IF THEY FIND OUT
YOU LIED ABOUT THAT,

41:23.454 --> 41:25.065
THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW.
SHE COULD GET DEPORTED

41:25.065 --> 41:26.762
AND YOU COULD
GO TO JAIL.

41:26.762 --> 41:28.416
BUT THERE'S
GOT TO BE A WAY OUT.

41:28.416 --> 41:29.809
I MEAN, GIVEN
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

41:29.809 --> 41:31.114
I'M SORRY.

41:32.115 --> 41:33.943
THIS IS
HOW IT IS.

41:35.684 --> 41:38.513
WE HAVE TO LIVE
WITH THIS NOW.

41:39.732 --> 41:41.516
"WE"?

41:41.516 --> 41:43.474
I'M SORRY.

41:51.961 --> 41:53.354
HEY.

41:53.354 --> 41:55.008
HI. CAN I COME IN?

41:55.008 --> 41:56.531
YEAH, YEAH. COME IN.

41:58.533 --> 42:00.361
WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?

42:00.361 --> 42:01.971
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T--
I WAS AT THE GROCERY STORE,

42:01.971 --> 42:03.582
AND I HAD A CRAVING
FOR SOMETHING DESSERTY.

42:03.582 --> 42:04.670
IT'S, UH...

42:04.670 --> 42:07.586
MY FAVORITE--
TRIPLE FUDGE CHUNK.

42:08.891 --> 42:11.241
AND SO I WAS
STANDING IN LINE

42:11.241 --> 42:14.157
AND I WAS FEELING
REALLY GUILTY.

42:14.157 --> 42:15.506
AND THEN I THOUGHT,
WELL, WHY?

42:15.506 --> 42:17.552
I MEAN, IT'S JUST YOGURT--
PROTEIN, CALCIUM.

42:17.552 --> 42:19.032
IT'S ALMOST FAT-FREE,
AND THEN I REALIZED

42:19.032 --> 42:23.166
THE REASON WAS--
WAS THAT I REALLY WANTED IT.

42:23.166 --> 42:27.867
AND SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE,
BY GIVING INTO THAT, THAT I MUST BE WEAK.

42:27.867 --> 42:31.305
BUT MAYBE--MAYBE
I'VE GOT IT ALL BACKWARDS.

42:31.305 --> 42:33.437
I MEAN, MAYBE
BY TAKING WHAT YOU WANT,

42:33.437 --> 42:34.743
IT'S--IT'S BEING STRONG.

42:35.962 --> 42:37.441
YOU KNOW.

42:51.020 --> 42:54.545
YOU STILL HAVE THAT TV
UPSTAIRS IN YOUR BEDROOM?

42:55.546 --> 42:57.331
YES.

42:57.331 --> 42:59.333
THERE'S A REALLY FUNNY GAME SHOW ON
THAT'LL ROT YOUR BRAIN.

42:59.333 --> 43:01.335
WANT TO WATCH IT WITH ME?

43:01.335 --> 43:04.033
MMM. I'LL GO
GET SOME SPOONS.

43:04.033 --> 43:05.687
ACTUALLY
I HAVE SOME ALREADY.

43:05.687 --> 43:06.688
OH, YOU DO?
MM-HMM.

43:06.688 --> 43:08.951
DON'T!
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T.

43:08.951 --> 43:11.084
[GIGGLING AND SQUEALING]
