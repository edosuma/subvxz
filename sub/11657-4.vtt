00:59.967 --> 01:02.233
Oh, it's a mess.
This place is just a mess.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.433
Rose, what am I gonna do?
She's gonna be here any minute.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.166
This place is a pigsty!

01:06.233 --> 01:09.700
-Oh, Blanche, it looks gorgeous.
-Don't sit! I just fluffed!

01:09.767 --> 01:12.533
-Honey, dust the table.
-I just did.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.000
Well, do it again.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.767
God, I wish she wasn't coming.
I just hate her.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.967
I can't believe you hate
your sister.

01:20.033 --> 01:21.300
I despise her.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.600
Oh, I wish I'd gotten a decorator.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.133
Nancy Reagan's decorator.

01:26.867 --> 01:28.400
That'd kill my sister.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.000
She's your sister.
How can you hate your sister?

01:32.066 --> 01:33.066
Because she made me

01:33.133 --> 01:35.834
and my big sister Charmaine
miserable our entire lives.

01:36.767 --> 01:38.367
I never heard of such a thing.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.700
You never heard of anybody
hating their sister?

01:40.767 --> 01:41.800
Never.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.734
Maybe it's southern.

01:44.967 --> 01:46.800
Sleeping with your brothers
is southern.

01:49.166 --> 01:51.900
Dust, Rose, dust!
We're running out of time.

01:53.633 --> 01:58.834
Sophia... if you hated your sister,
would you clean the house?

01:58.900 --> 02:01.233
I'd put Vaseline
on the tips of her walker.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.467
(singsong)
Everybody, look what I have.

02:08.533 --> 02:10.166
-Where did you find...?
-Oh, no.

02:10.233 --> 02:12.233
-Ohh.
-Don't sit. Don't sit!

02:12.300 --> 02:15.967
-Oh, what is our name?
-This is Danny.

02:16.033 --> 02:18.066
Dorothy, what in the world is that?

02:18.133 --> 02:22.000
It's a flounder, Blanche.
What do you think it is?

02:22.066 --> 02:24.900
-What's that baby doing here?
-It's Lucy and Ted's baby.

02:24.967 --> 02:26.900
Ted had a little accident
waterskiing,

02:26.967 --> 02:29.567
and Lucy's taking him
to the hospital.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.834
Now, we cannot have a baby
in this house.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.100
-My sister's coming.
-Does she eat them?

02:36.600 --> 02:38.600
I have cleaned this house
from top to bottom.

02:38.667 --> 02:41.967
I have killed myself for two days.
Now, babies make a mess.

02:42.033 --> 02:45.233
In diapers. And unless
we use them as place mats,

02:45.300 --> 02:47.000
your sister will never know.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.266
Oh, lord.

02:48.333 --> 02:52.600
Boochie-boochie-boochie-boo.
Oochie-boochie-boo-boo...

02:52.667 --> 02:54.467
Finally, someone she can talk to.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.900
I just hope it doesn't make a fuss
when my sister's here.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.567
I thought you hate
this sister who's coming.

03:01.633 --> 03:02.734
I do.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.200
I'm gonna put him to bed.
Ma, the ba-bas.

03:06.033 --> 03:09.200
Why do you hate your sister?
That's what I wanna know.

03:09.266 --> 03:12.266
Because when she was born,
I ceased to exist.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.667
I never saw my mama
and daddy again.

03:14.734 --> 03:16.000
Where did they go?

03:17.333 --> 03:19.934
They never looked at me again, Rose.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.500
She was the adorable one,
the gorgeous one, the brilliant one.

03:24.567 --> 03:27.433
She sat in my daddy's lap
for 16 years.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.000
Oh, and she was hateful.
You know what she used to do?

03:30.066 --> 03:33.066
She used to bite herself on the arm
and then run crying to daddy

03:33.133 --> 03:35.000
that I had done it
and he'd punish me.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.533
Oh, she got me in trouble
all the time.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.734
Daddy used to call me the bad seed.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.867
-Once, she even electrocuted me.
-Oh, no!

03:44.934 --> 03:48.400
Oh, yes.
It was the day before Christmas,

03:48.467 --> 03:50.667
and we were playing,
and she jiggled the tree

03:50.734 --> 03:52.400
and the star fell off and broke.

03:52.467 --> 03:55.200
So she told me to pick it up
and put it on my finger.

03:55.266 --> 03:56.367
And I did.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.200
Then she plugged it in.

04:01.467 --> 04:03.033
And wham!

04:03.100 --> 04:06.066
My eyes bugged out,
my hair shot straight up.

04:06.533 --> 04:10.166
I did a crazy rubber dance
all over the room.

04:10.233 --> 04:12.500
I'm sure my heart even stopped
beating for a minute.

04:12.567 --> 04:13.834
Then she ran to daddy and told him

04:13.900 --> 04:16.467
that I had broken the star
and almost electrocuted her...

04:16.834 --> 04:19.166
and he sent me to my room
for all of Christmas eve...

04:20.000 --> 04:22.333
and told me that baby Jesus
was mad at me

04:22.400 --> 04:23.567
for ruining his birthday.

04:25.767 --> 04:29.533
-Oh, Blanche, that's horrible.
-And that's not the worst part.

04:29.967 --> 04:32.033
That darn electricity
straightened my hair.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.667
I used to have curly hair.

04:44.734 --> 04:46.900
That was a lovely lunch, Blanche,

04:46.967 --> 04:51.166
a lovely lunch in a lovely house
with your lovely friends.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.233
Stop making fun of me, Virginia.

04:53.300 --> 04:56.533
Making fun of you?
Honey, I was complimenting you.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.567
-I heard the way you said "lovely."
-How did I say "lovely"?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.633
Oh, you know very well
how you said "lovely."

05:01.700 --> 05:04.066
You said "lovely" the same way
you say "lovely" to a date

05:04.133 --> 05:06.066
who's just shown up
in a light-blue tuxedo.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.467
Here. Sit.

05:08.867 --> 05:12.400
Well, I meant lovely
no matter how it came out.

05:13.266 --> 05:16.433
I guess maybe I just didn't think
you'd recognize good taste.

05:16.934 --> 05:19.967
You know, this house was done
by Nancy Reagan's decorator.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.100
-Really?
-Yes.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.834
But never mind about that.
Let's talk about you.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.700
You look like you lost a little
weight, sugar.

05:29.767 --> 05:30.800
I have.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.166
You know, at your age,
when you lose weight,

05:33.233 --> 05:35.400
your skin just hangs there like...

05:38.800 --> 05:40.300
...like leaves on a willow.

05:41.100 --> 05:44.333
I haven't lost that much.
I don't think that's happened yet.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.800
Well, I don't know, but...

05:46.233 --> 05:48.633
if I were you,
I sure wouldn't wave goodbye.

05:51.567 --> 05:54.700
And if I were you, I sure wouldn't
jog without a muumuu.

05:54.767 --> 05:57.867
Is that so? Well, just let me tell
you something!

05:57.934 --> 06:01.567
Oh, Blanche, please.
Let's not do this. Let's grow up.

06:01.633 --> 06:05.200
For God's sake, we have done this
our whole lives long.

06:05.266 --> 06:08.734
-Let's call an end to it, ok?
-Sure, whatever.

06:11.133 --> 06:12.266
So...

06:13.533 --> 06:15.200
you thinking about
getting a face-lift?

06:18.133 --> 06:20.967
For your, uh... how do I put this
delicately?

06:21.467 --> 06:22.867
Turkey wattle or what?

06:27.166 --> 06:30.000
-(Danny crying)
-There, there.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.967
It's colic. My children had it.

06:33.033 --> 06:35.166
-You give them brandy.
-For colic?

06:35.233 --> 06:37.667
Yes. After dinner with a cigar.

06:39.967 --> 06:43.567
Rose, you give brandy for teething.
You rub it on their gums.

06:44.233 --> 06:47.033
Oh. I thought
I gave it to them for colic.

06:47.467 --> 06:48.667
In their bottles.

06:51.033 --> 06:52.800
Well, my babies were very happy.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.500
Put it in my bottle.
I'll be happy, too.

06:58.533 --> 07:01.667
Look at this - pop-ups.
Isn't that wonderful?

07:02.033 --> 07:04.934
Mm. Remember when we had to use
cotton and fish ointment?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.900
That's nothing. In Sicily,
we use a leaf and the river.

07:09.300 --> 07:13.333
-Ma, you never had a baby in Sicily.
-I was a baby in Sicily.

07:15.066 --> 07:17.367
Disposable bottles and formula.

07:17.433 --> 07:20.500
We had to sterilize our bottles
and make our formula.

07:20.567 --> 07:21.700
I nursed.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.233
Your brother was 12 when he stopped.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.300
He wanted to come home
from school at lunchtime.

07:33.033 --> 07:35.233
-I got nothing left up here.
-Oh, ma.

07:40.233 --> 07:41.400
Well, she's gone.

07:42.133 --> 07:45.533
That's it? That's why we couldn't
sit on the couch for two days?

07:45.600 --> 07:47.834
No. I have to have dinner
with her tonight.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.467
-Why is that baby still here?
-They're still at the hospital.

07:50.533 --> 07:52.433
It's taking a little longer
than they thought.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.300
Blanche, your sister
seemed very nice.

07:55.367 --> 07:57.333
She was nicer
than she's ever been.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.100
She was interested,
charming, caring, loving.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.967
Just couldn't have been
more wonderful.

08:03.367 --> 08:07.266
I just... wonder what she wants,
the conniving little witch.

08:11.934 --> 08:13.600
You're welcome, Maurice.

08:14.467 --> 08:17.367
-Let's make a toast.
-With water?

08:17.433 --> 08:19.533
-Well, I can't drink.
-You never could.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.700
One Jack Daniel's, and you'd disappear
with half a fraternity house.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.600
Blanche, we said
we weren't gonna do this.

08:26.667 --> 08:27.734
Well, what else can we do?

08:27.800 --> 08:30.400
We never held a real conversation
our entire lives.

08:30.967 --> 08:33.767
Well, then, it's time for us to start, ok?

08:33.834 --> 08:34.834
Fine with me.

08:35.734 --> 08:40.066
To us. To the beginning of a new
and wonderful relationship.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.200
To sisters.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.834
That's very sweet, Virginia.

08:44.367 --> 08:45.600
Now, what do you want?

08:48.600 --> 08:49.934
What is it with you?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.767
You just step on any kind
of tender moment.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.100
Oh, tender moment, my foot.

08:55.433 --> 08:58.333
All my life, you've taken everything
that ever meant anything to me.

08:58.767 --> 09:00.233
What did I take?

09:00.300 --> 09:03.200
A couple of cashmere sweaters
and a poodle skirt?

09:03.734 --> 09:06.166
You took my poodle skirt?
Was that you?

09:07.700 --> 09:11.367
-Blanche, that was over 40 years ago.
-Oh, shut up.

09:13.266 --> 09:16.367
I can't believe that you are
still crazy about that.

09:17.066 --> 09:18.100
It's not over that.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.967
-It's over Tom.
-Tom?

09:21.033 --> 09:24.734
Don't act so surprised, Virginia.
You knew I was dating him.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.000
Then I had to go to the country
to visit aunt Augusta,

09:27.066 --> 09:30.333
and when I got back,
I had poison ivy and you had Tom.

09:30.900 --> 09:33.934
I loved that boy. I wanted to marry him.
We were serious.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.600
-You only had two dates with him.
-I was fast.

09:40.166 --> 09:43.367
I swear, I didn't think
that you liked him at all.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.100
Then I had to be maid of honor
at your wedding.

09:46.467 --> 09:48.800
I had to stand there
and watch you marry Tom.

09:49.233 --> 09:51.066
And I had to wear that green dress...

09:51.333 --> 09:53.300
which you knew
was my most awful color.

09:53.367 --> 09:54.834
I looked just like a swamp frog.

09:57.266 --> 09:58.767
Everyone I ever loved, you took.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.300
Would it help you to know
that Tom fooled around?

10:03.367 --> 10:04.367
No.

10:05.066 --> 10:06.200
With who?

10:07.800 --> 10:09.033
Everyone.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.233
Huh. Serves you right.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.300
-Blanche!
-Well, it does.

10:13.367 --> 10:15.033
What goes around, comes around.

10:17.567 --> 10:20.133
Well, then, I must have been really bad.

10:20.900 --> 10:21.900
What do you mean?

10:23.300 --> 10:27.567
-Well, it's the reason I'm here.
-I knew it. I knew you had a reason.

10:27.967 --> 10:29.000
Better be a good one.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.166
I'm dying.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.300
What?

10:36.767 --> 10:37.900
I'm dying.

10:44.133 --> 10:47.467
Well... my God.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.033
That explains it, then.

10:53.066 --> 10:54.066
What?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.800
Why you're looking
so much older than I am.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.500
(crunching)

11:23.400 --> 11:26.166
Ma, could you eat a little more quietly,
please?

11:26.233 --> 11:28.633
These are Fritos.
You want me to swallow them whole?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.934
-Hi, everybody.
-(Dorothy) Hi, Blanche.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Oh, the baby gone?

11:34.066 --> 11:36.400
No. Rose is driving him around
to get him to sleep.

11:36.467 --> 11:38.800
-Why is he still here?
-Ted needs some minor surgery

11:38.867 --> 11:40.266
so they're still at the hospital.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.233
-What about Virginia?
-Well...

11:42.300 --> 11:44.967
-Shh-shh-shh-shh.
-(Dorothy) Is he asleep?

11:45.033 --> 11:46.700
-You need any help?
-No.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.834
-We're gonna have that baby till college.
-Shh.

11:50.533 --> 11:51.767
So, how was dinner?

11:52.467 --> 11:54.567
-I'm still in shock.
-What happened?

11:55.734 --> 11:57.900
-I just can't believe it.
-What?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.700
You just never think you're gonna
hear that.

11:59.767 --> 12:01.233
Blanche, tell me.

12:02.066 --> 12:03.066
She's dying.

12:04.133 --> 12:05.133
What?

12:06.133 --> 12:08.533
-My sister's dying.
-What?

12:08.600 --> 12:09.767
Dying. She's dying.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.500
Oh, my God, Blanche!

12:13.400 --> 12:16.033
Oh, honey, I didn't even know
you were sick.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.867
-Not Blanche. Her sister.
-Oh, thank God.

12:22.266 --> 12:23.667
Oh!

12:26.100 --> 12:28.767
And she came here to tell you. Is that it?

12:28.834 --> 12:30.767
No, please. She could've done that
over the phone.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.333
No, it was like I said.
She wanted something.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.800
Oh, please. Enough already!

12:33.867 --> 12:36.767
I mean, the woman is dying. What
could she possibly want from you?

12:37.834 --> 12:39.066
My kidney.

12:49.667 --> 12:50.734
Your kidney?

12:51.767 --> 12:52.867
My kidney.

12:53.500 --> 12:57.166
-Why would she need a kidney?
-To feed the cat, Rose!

13:04.033 --> 13:09.100
She's going into renal failure,
so a transplant is her best hope.

13:09.166 --> 13:11.633
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

13:12.066 --> 13:14.133
What happens if she doesn't
get your kidney?

13:14.200 --> 13:15.400
She'll die.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.166
You hold her life in your hands?
What are you gonna do?

13:19.233 --> 13:20.433
I don't know.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.000
I'm glad you're not my sister.

13:29.367 --> 13:32.166
-I need something to eat.
-Well, didn't you just have dinner?

13:32.233 --> 13:34.667
Oh, I couldn't eat.
I was just too stunned.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.767
-What are you gonna do, Blanche?
-Oh, I don't know.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.834
I mean, it's not as if
she were my daughter.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.467
She's my sister, my sister that I hate.

13:44.533 --> 13:47.533
I wish I could give her my kidneys,
let her get up all night.

13:51.867 --> 13:53.367
And what if I give her my kidney,

13:53.433 --> 13:56.066
and then the one good kidney
I have left stops working?

13:56.133 --> 13:58.066
What do I do then,
ask for my kidney back?

13:58.133 --> 13:59.767
You'd be an Indian giver.

14:03.266 --> 14:05.033
I need both my kidneys.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.066
You know what'll happen
if I give her one?

14:07.133 --> 14:10.066
My ankles will swell,
my eyes will puff up.

14:10.133 --> 14:12.000
I'll look just like
the Pillsbury doughboy.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.867
Blanche, that does not happen.
You can live just fine with one kidney.

14:18.934 --> 14:20.867
I can't eat this food.
I'm going to bed.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.066
I'll just think about it tomorrow.

14:24.867 --> 14:28.233
All I know is, girls,
I'm in a no-win situation here.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.333
I lose a sister or a kidney.

14:30.967 --> 14:33.233
Either way, no matter what I do,
I'm gonna lose something.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.033
What would you do?

14:39.867 --> 14:42.533
Well... for my children,
I wouldn't even have to think.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.266
I mean, I'd give them both my kidneys.
I'd cut 'em out myself.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.934
Me too. I'd give them my heart.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.867
I'd give to all my children, except Phil.

14:53.533 --> 14:54.967
Why not Phil?

14:55.033 --> 14:56.767
Because he never calls,
he never writes.

14:56.834 --> 14:57.967
I only hear from him at Christmas

14:58.033 --> 15:00.433
when he sends me a cheddar cheese
nativity scene.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.200
I'm Catholic.

15:06.266 --> 15:08.667
I can't spread a wise man
on a Ritz cracker.

15:21.867 --> 15:25.166
If I still had my dog, Fluffy,
I'd give to him.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.367
-You'd give what to Fluffy?
-My kidney.

15:28.433 --> 15:30.934
Oh, come on, Rose.
You'd give a kidney to a dog?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.100
Absolutely.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.066
So he could wiz on your rug?

15:38.734 --> 15:42.567
I would give to him because of
everything he gave to me.

15:42.633 --> 15:45.800
He was loving,
he was loyal, he was fun.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.934
He never left my side.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.500
I wish my ex had been like Fluffy.

15:51.867 --> 15:56.000
-Would have solved a lot of problems.
-You could have had him fixed.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.533
Oh, poor Blanche.

16:10.967 --> 16:14.400
Blanche, I know you need
some time to think it over.

16:14.467 --> 16:15.867
You're damn right I do.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.333
We're talking about a vital organ
in my body here.

16:18.900 --> 16:19.900
I know.

16:20.633 --> 16:23.467
-You gonna give it to her or not?
-Sophia.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.100
What does it mean,
a little less bourbon?

16:26.934 --> 16:30.200
It's a big decision, Sophia.
She's got to think about it.

16:30.266 --> 16:31.367
She's family.

16:31.433 --> 16:34.066
If you can't count on family,
who the hell can you count on?

16:36.867 --> 16:38.033
She's Italian.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.400
I'll understand, you know,
if you decide not to.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.100
Well, how come you
didn't ask Charmaine for her kidney?

16:50.166 --> 16:51.767
You were always closer to Charmaine.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.467
Charmaine's kidneys are attached to
each other.

16:54.533 --> 16:55.967
What do you mean, attached?

16:56.033 --> 16:57.233
Well, the two are joined.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.266
It's like having one big kidney
and you can't separate 'em.

17:01.033 --> 17:02.333
Leave it to Charmaine.

17:03.333 --> 17:06.900
I know. She never could help mama
because she had heart flutters,

17:06.967 --> 17:10.934
and she never could take gym class,
no, because she had a tipped uterus,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.667
and she never did any housework
because she had a spastic colon.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.033
Now, she has attached kidneys.

17:19.467 --> 17:21.166
That girl is some kind of mutant.

17:24.533 --> 17:25.834
I'd give you one of my kidneys,

17:25.900 --> 17:28.467
but I'm sure you'd rather have one
you can control.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.200
-(Virginia) Thank you, Sophia.
-Welcome.

17:40.633 --> 17:44.133
55Look, if you decide not to,
I'll understand. I swear.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.567
Sure. You'll be dead...

17:46.467 --> 17:48.266
and everybody will say,
"Blanche killed her."

17:50.600 --> 17:52.800
What I'm trying to say...

17:53.867 --> 17:56.467
is it's a terrible choice I've given you.

17:56.533 --> 18:00.100
I don't even know what I would do
under the same circumstances.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.734
Are you saying you don't know
if you'd give me a kidney?

18:05.500 --> 18:06.667
No, I don't.

18:07.734 --> 18:10.266
Well, I'm not surprised.
You never even lent me a Kleenex.

18:12.066 --> 18:14.934
Besides, I'm a size eight.
Your kidney wouldn't fit me.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.133
There's not room in my body
for your kidney.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.100
Well, I guess I'd better be going, and...

18:23.700 --> 18:25.700
if you decide to go ahead with it...

18:26.500 --> 18:28.700
I'll see you in Atlanta in a few days.

18:31.166 --> 18:33.567
-Are you scared?
-Terrified.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.066
I guess anybody would be.

18:36.767 --> 18:37.767
I guess.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.734
Blanche... whatever happens...

18:47.400 --> 18:48.500
(sighs)

18:52.300 --> 18:54.000
(kisses) I love you.

19:12.233 --> 19:13.934
Thank you. Bye.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.567
The doctor says it's the first time
he's ever been called

19:17.633 --> 19:19.500
because a baby was sleeping
in the day.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.633
And then I think he called me an idiot.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.066
He is sleeping in the day

19:24.133 --> 19:27.100
because he has four women
who won't let him sleep at night.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.200
Now, who went in there last night?
Was it you?

19:29.533 --> 19:31.667
-Well, I went in once.
-Why?

19:31.734 --> 19:34.000
I'd been working.
I hadn't seen him all day.

19:34.066 --> 19:36.300
-And was he sleeping?
-At first.

19:38.900 --> 19:42.000
This has got to stop.
No wonder that baby didn't sleep.

19:42.066 --> 19:44.834
He wasn't the only one
who was up all night.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.433
-You were, too?
-Yes. I had time to do a lot of thinking.

19:48.867 --> 19:49.900
And?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.066
And of course I'm gonna do it.

19:53.133 --> 19:55.834
Aw, Blanche, you're a brave lady.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.133
-Oh, you really are, honey.
-No, I have to.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.433
I don't want my sister to die.
I want her to live.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.834
And not just for her, for me.

20:04.567 --> 20:06.500
I wanna get to know her like a grownup.

20:07.066 --> 20:11.100
Well, I want us to have a chance
to be friends, sisters.

20:11.934 --> 20:13.934
After all, she's the only family I have.

20:14.767 --> 20:19.266
-I thought you had a sister Charmaine.
-Oh, you can't count her!

20:20.533 --> 20:23.066
Why, she's an awful, selfish,
neurotic woman

20:23.133 --> 20:25.867
who made me and Virginia
miserable our entire lives.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.400
I gotta go pack.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.633
-I hate to give him back.
-Goodbye, Danny.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.100
Goodbye, pussycat.
Goodbye, little fella.

20:38.166 --> 20:40.900
What are you carrying on?
It's like talking to a salami.

20:42.633 --> 20:44.967
Well, he has to leave.
I'll be right back.

20:45.033 --> 20:47.900
-Say bye-zee-bye!
-Bye, darling.

20:48.467 --> 20:49.767
You be good now.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.333
(sighs)

20:53.300 --> 20:56.800
I'm worried about Blanche.
I wish she had let one of us go with her.

20:56.867 --> 20:58.433
Not me. I hate hospitals.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.667
My friend Manny Fishbein
went into the hospital a healthy guy.

21:01.734 --> 21:04.767
Then boom, boom, dead,
just like that, in his sleep.

21:04.834 --> 21:08.100
98 years old. No apparent cause.

21:10.033 --> 21:12.967
I don't like hospitals, either.
They're full of germs.

21:13.266 --> 21:15.066
I always hold my breath
in the elevators

21:15.133 --> 21:18.333
'cause there are sick people in the
elevators and it's such a small space.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.233
Once, I had to go
to the eighth floor in a hospital,

21:21.300 --> 21:23.800
and the elevator stopped
on every floor,

21:23.867 --> 21:26.000
and I had to hold my breath
all that time.

21:26.333 --> 21:29.333
And I finally fainted
and I hit my head

21:29.400 --> 21:31.700
and then I had to stay there
because I had a concussion,

21:31.767 --> 21:34.600
and I had to hold my breath
all the way down in the elevator

21:34.667 --> 21:35.700
to the emergency room.

21:35.767 --> 21:37.800
Then I had to hold my breath
in the X-ray,

21:37.867 --> 21:39.800
where they ask you
to hold your breath anyway.

21:39.867 --> 21:42.233
-And then after...
-I have great news.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.934
Rose, excuse me. We'll get back to your
fascinating hospital story later.

21:48.233 --> 21:51.633
Ted and Lucy said that we could have
the baby again next month

21:51.700 --> 21:55.767
-when they go away for a weekend.
-Oh, that's wonderful. Oh, I'm so excited.

21:56.367 --> 21:57.700
Hello, everybody.

21:57.767 --> 22:00.800
(Dorothy) Blanche, what are you
doing here? Is something wrong?

22:00.867 --> 22:03.433
I mean, we didn't
expect you back so soon.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.867
No, the best possible thing
has happened.

22:05.934 --> 22:09.066
I still have both my kidneys,
and my sister's fine.

22:09.567 --> 22:11.600
Blanche, how is that possible?

22:11.667 --> 22:15.367
They couldn't use my kidney.
My blood vessels were too small.

22:15.967 --> 22:18.633
Of course, they're too small.
I've always been very petite.

22:20.133 --> 22:21.800
Blanche, Virginia?

22:21.867 --> 22:23.667
Oh, well the most wonderful
thing happened.

22:23.734 --> 22:26.667
They found a donor,
an excellent match.

22:26.734 --> 22:29.467
She was a retired
Mormon schoolteacher.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.600
Virginia's so lucky!

22:36.667 --> 22:40.967
Oh, I'll say.
That kidney was showroom-new.

22:42.533 --> 22:45.400
Why, the wildest thing that ever
passed through there was oval tine.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
But the best part of it was that hunk of a
doctor who examined me,

22:54.066 --> 22:55.900
he's gonna be in Florida
in a few weeks.

22:57.100 --> 23:01.033
-Wherever she goes, she finds a man!
-So do hookers.

23:07.300 --> 23:11.767
But the most wonderful thing
about all this is Virginia and me.

23:12.367 --> 23:16.433
All that time we wasted hating each other
from when we were kids.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.633
Now we're getting to know each other
and I just love her.

23:19.700 --> 23:22.233
I finally have a sister to love.

23:23.266 --> 23:24.333
Isn't it funny?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.333
Sometimes you have to
almost lose somebody

23:27.400 --> 23:30.633
before you realize how much
they really mean to you.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.800
Let's go out and celebrate life.

23:33.867 --> 23:35.667
Let's go out and do something crazy!

23:35.734 --> 23:38.367
Let's fly to Freeport
and gamble all night.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.934
Ma, we can't afford it.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.333
Let's drive to Disney world
and ride the teacups!

23:44.400 --> 23:46.667
Oh, too wild, Rose.

23:48.133 --> 23:51.000
Hey, I know a bar over in Cocoa Beach

23:51.066 --> 23:53.767
where you can pick up
over-the-hill astronauts.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.200
Ow!

23:58.734 --> 24:02.800
Or... there's some rocky road
in the freezer.

24:02.867 --> 24:04.967
-Hey, great!
-You're talking!
