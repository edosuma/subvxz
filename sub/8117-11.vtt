WEBVTT

00:25.793 --> 00:28.762
Lucas.
There you are.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.632
Everything's coming together
right on schedule.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.034
Mining rigs were just delivered.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.136
Being loaded in now.
Good.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.904
No point in
any of this

00:36.937 --> 00:39.407
without those diggers.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.343
Been meaning to ask
since you got back.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.346
What, um... what
happened to your...?

00:46.514 --> 00:48.249
Nykoraptor.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.651
Another couple of inches,
it would've had my jugular.

00:50.684 --> 00:55.423
I would've been lunch, and
you'd be a much poorer man.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.761
Let's not count our money yet.

01:00.794 --> 01:05.199
A lot still has to go right before
we even get to Terra Nova.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.101
With the 11th Pilgrimage
leaving tomorrow,

01:07.135 --> 01:09.170
security in Hope Plaza's

01:09.203 --> 01:11.105
gonna be extra
tight. We'll get there.

01:11.139 --> 01:14.508
We have the best army
money can buy.

01:34.228 --> 01:37.798
Adjust that vantage point!
You got a blind spot!

01:37.831 --> 01:39.267
What's the
perimeter status?

01:39.300 --> 01:41.635
North and South
Quadrants are secure, sir.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.671
How many men we got
in the tree line? 30, sir.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.273
That's almost a third
of our force.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.716
Pull a dozen, send them
back to the colony.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.210
Don't want to spread
ourselves too thin. Yes, sir.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.644
Doc, how are
the med tents coming?

01:50.678 --> 01:53.080
Yeah, we're gonna set up
further back in the clearing.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.449
We have CO2 infusers
if we get pilgrims...

01:55.483 --> 01:58.586
and a mobile trauma unit
in case we get casualties.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.757
Just be ready to fall
back to the colony

02:03.791 --> 02:05.893
if, uh, things go sideways.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.231
Dunham.

02:10.264 --> 02:13.000
Remember, they can only
come through two at a time,

02:13.033 --> 02:14.568
three at the most,
so we use

02:14.602 --> 02:17.305
the choke point to our
advantage, yes? Yes, sir.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.308
Why not just shut
this whole thing down

02:20.341 --> 02:21.651
and stop anyone
from coming through?

02:21.675 --> 02:24.345
Um, because the terminus
only anchors our end here.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.080
Even if we shut it down,
the time fracture would open...

02:27.114 --> 02:28.482
somewhere else...

02:28.516 --> 02:31.118
within about three klicks.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.586
This is our best
shot at them.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.455
At least we know where
they're coming through.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.392
When Hope Plaza fires up that
particle accelerator tomorrow,

02:38.426 --> 02:40.294
we're either getting
a hundred colonists

02:40.328 --> 02:42.263
looking for a new lease on life

02:42.296 --> 02:45.599
or an army bent
on destroying our home.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.934
Either way...

02:46.967 --> 02:49.403
let's be ready.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.030
I really think we'll be fine.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.300
I mean, a defensible
location is key.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.502
It forces the enemy
to play offense,

03:21.535 --> 03:24.372
which everybody knows is
the more difficult position.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.140
Mark gave me a book
on military strategy.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.710
Romantic.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.312
If there's a war,

03:31.345 --> 03:32.346
can I shoot

03:32.380 --> 03:34.682
with the sonic cannon?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.518
No, you cannot.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.186
Hopefully,

03:39.219 --> 03:41.389
there's not gonna be
a war. God willing.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.957
We won't know anything
for sure until tomorrow.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.226
Besides,

03:46.260 --> 03:48.061
this family's been
through a lot together

03:48.095 --> 03:49.062
we'll get through
this, too.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.030
All Shannons agree?

03:50.063 --> 03:50.898
Yes!
Yup!

03:50.931 --> 03:52.600
Yup!

03:56.970 --> 03:58.772
Hey, Dad?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.975
Is there any way I can come
out there with you tomorrow,

04:02.009 --> 04:03.277
in case Kara
does come through?

04:03.311 --> 04:04.678
No, I'm sorry
it's too dangerous.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.315
And I need you here to
look after your sisters.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.017
But if Kara comes
through the portal...

04:10.050 --> 04:12.520
I'll watch out for her.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.356
Promise.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.474
Be careful out there.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.609
I will.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.347
We're moving out.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.449
Got to go.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.361
I love you.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.197
I love you, too.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.701
All right, well, don't forget,

05:00.734 --> 05:02.479
anything happens to the
colony while I'm gone,

05:02.503 --> 05:04.037
it's coming right
out of your paycheck.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.239
I want to be out there
with you. Nah, nah.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.409
I need to keep you
safe and sound. Wash,

05:08.442 --> 05:11.078
who'd stitch me up?
All right, can the chatter.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.448
Do you have to go?

05:14.482 --> 05:17.385
Darling, we'll be back
before you know it, okay?

05:17.418 --> 05:20.153
Listen, if the fighting
makes its way back

05:20.187 --> 05:22.656
to the colony,
you hide, got it?

05:22.690 --> 05:25.225
You take Maddy and Zoe and
hide until we come find you.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.727
- Got it.
- All right.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.928
Bye.
Bye.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.899
Patrol out!

05:45.979 --> 05:48.882
It's gonna be okay, Zoe.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.734
Everybody in position.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.170
Nobody fires
without my order.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.007
Here we go.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.744
Sir, we got
a tight-beam com-link.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.646
It's them.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.982
Taylor, do you read?

06:22.015 --> 06:24.752
Go ahead, 2149.

06:24.785 --> 06:29.623
Terra Nova, this is Hope Plaza.
Do you read? Over.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.792
Hope Plaza, this is Taylor.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.994
Read you loud and clear. Over.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.429
Commander Taylor,

06:35.463 --> 06:38.065
are you ready to receive
the 11th Pilgrimage?

06:38.098 --> 06:39.867
What do you think?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.669
I think they're
following protocol,

06:41.702 --> 06:45.138
which is exactly what I would do
if I were planning an attack.

06:47.841 --> 06:51.278
Hope Plaza, we are ready
to receive.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.880
Commencing portal transfer.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.127
Stand right there.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.063
Hold your fire.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.267
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

07:14.301 --> 07:16.804
Peter?

07:16.837 --> 07:20.007
All right, the first three
pilgrims check out so far.

07:20.040 --> 07:24.144
Stand by. Maintain
your positions.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.714
Move those kids out.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.784
Move 'em through.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.100
I got this one.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.037
Kara.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.905
Mr. Shannon!

07:58.512 --> 07:59.980
Please,

08:00.013 --> 08:01.148
help me.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.816
Bomb!

09:56.964 --> 09:58.799
Elisabeth?

09:59.266 --> 10:01.334
Elisabeth...

11:05.565 --> 11:07.167
You can't be up here.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.468
Taylor.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.303
Get back now!

11:25.185 --> 11:28.588
You need to leave, and
you need to leave now.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.489
It's okay,
he's with me.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.523
It's okay.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.159
Elisabeth.
Yeah, it's me.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.203
He's just disoriented, okay?
He doesn't mean any harm.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.529
Come on.

11:37.597 --> 11:38.932
What happened?

11:38.966 --> 11:40.543
I'll explain everything
when I get you inside.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.969
Where are the kids?

11:42.002 --> 11:44.772
It's okay, they're at
home, they're safe.

11:45.438 --> 11:49.276
There, that
should help.

11:50.577 --> 11:53.080
Can you hear me now?

11:53.814 --> 11:58.051
Elisabeth,
what's going on?

11:58.085 --> 12:01.955
The last thing I remember
was the explosion.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.324
That was three
days ago, Jim.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.764
Why did they
set it off?

12:10.798 --> 12:14.835
Were they trying
to untether the fracture?

12:14.868 --> 12:17.370
It reopened closer
to the colony.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.107
Their army came through and
headed straight for the gates.

12:20.140 --> 12:23.643
There was no way Taylor
could make it back in time.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.679
But there were
soldiers here, Washington.

12:26.713 --> 12:30.150
Yeah, she held them
off as best she could.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.855
26 people were killed before
she finally surrendered.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.659
What about Taylor?

12:39.692 --> 12:41.962
Nobody's heard
from him.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.597
Dr. Shannon!

12:44.631 --> 12:47.100
Bed Six
is bleeding out.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.970
Go see the kids.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.479
Daddy, you're okay,
you're okay.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.247
Of course I'm okay.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.714
You didn't think
a little explosion

13:01.748 --> 13:03.616
would stop
your old dad, did you?

13:03.650 --> 13:05.618
I'm so glad
you're home.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.320
Oh, my girls.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.355
Me, too.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.958
Hey, where's Josh?

13:18.431 --> 13:20.433
Dad.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.906
Kara.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.983
It's my fault for trying
to get her here.

13:37.617 --> 13:41.989
If I had just left everything
alone, she'd still be alive.

13:51.731 --> 13:54.534
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.536
I'm so sorry.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.784
Zoe's finally asleep.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.287
Where is my gun?

14:14.321 --> 14:16.332
First thing they did
was confiscate all the weapons.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.960
I'm surprised they left
us with a bread knife.

14:24.597 --> 14:25.865
It's the search lights.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.435
They start
at nightfall.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.636
Curfew is from 8:00.

14:29.669 --> 14:30.637
It's like being back

14:30.670 --> 14:32.973
in Golad Prison.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.418
Why go to the trouble
of keeping us all here?

14:35.442 --> 14:38.378
Why didn't they just clear
the colony out?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.247
We're hostages.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.049
Taylor won't try
and retake the colony

14:42.082 --> 14:43.917
if there are still
civilians inside.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.719
Is anyone fighting back?

14:46.753 --> 14:48.121
Less and less.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.290
We're outnumbered.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.126
And anyone
who does try to resist...

14:53.160 --> 14:55.428
Sent straight to the brig

14:55.462 --> 14:56.263
or worse.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.564
Is that where Washington is?

14:57.597 --> 15:00.767
No, they keep a close
eye on her, though.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.470
I think they like to have her
out where people can see her.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.539
Reminds us that
they're in charge.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.810
Yeah.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.579
I got to go talk to Wash.

15:17.184 --> 15:19.152
Here we are, gents.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.288
That'll be 18 Terras.

15:22.322 --> 15:26.493
Uh, on second thought,
this round's on the house.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.495
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.030
Drink up, boys,

15:30.063 --> 15:31.498
we got
thirsty work

15:31.531 --> 15:33.300
ahead of us.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.142
Wash?

15:44.244 --> 15:47.947
Shannon... you're awake.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.085
They told me it didn't
look good for you.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.087
It's okay now.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.724
Listen, I need to know
what's going on here.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.892
Who the hell are
these people?

15:59.926 --> 16:03.030
They're the Phoenix Group.

16:03.063 --> 16:07.700
They're private military,
killers for hire.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.738
Who hired 'em?

16:12.605 --> 16:16.376
Whoever Lucas
is working for in 2149.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.246
All I know is, they
must have deep pockets

16:19.279 --> 16:22.115
to mount an
operation this big.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.452
We fought 'em best
that we could,

16:25.485 --> 16:28.421
but once they started
shelling the colony

16:28.455 --> 16:32.425
and killing
innocent people,

16:32.459 --> 16:34.461
there's nothing
I could do.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.600
Except raise
the white flag.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.971
Okay, so...

16:45.004 --> 16:46.573
what's the plan?

16:46.606 --> 16:48.575
Do I look like someone
who has a plan

16:48.608 --> 16:50.243
to you?
No.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.954
You look like someone
who's punishing herself

16:51.978 --> 16:53.180
for doing
what she had

16:53.213 --> 16:55.482
to do to save
innocent lives.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.420
You got a way
to contact Taylor?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.489
No.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.192
They got this
colony locked down.

17:05.224 --> 17:09.462
Nothing gets in or out
without them knowing about it.

17:09.496 --> 17:13.233
They came here to
strip-mine the place,

17:13.266 --> 17:16.368
but how are they gonna
ship anything back to 2149

17:16.403 --> 17:19.306
when they blew up the terminus?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.407
They brought a new one
back with them

17:21.441 --> 17:23.576
to make the fracture
go both ways.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.712
Lucky for us,

17:25.744 --> 17:29.849
they had a run-in
with a pack of Carnos, that

17:29.882 --> 17:31.918
snapped the thing in half.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.886
Chalk one up
for the Cretaceous.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.822
Yeah, well, don't
get too excited.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.158
They're fixing it.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.561
And when I say "they,"

17:41.594 --> 17:43.163
I mean Malcolm.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.399
Listen...

17:46.433 --> 17:49.702
These guys think
it's all over.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.671
But we can still fight them.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.109
What do you have in mind?

17:56.143 --> 17:57.777
Oh, we hurt 'em.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.381
And we keep on hurting
them till they're gone.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.616
See, I like the sound of that.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.293
Where's Jim Shannon?

18:18.965 --> 18:21.801
Nurse... this is
Jim Shannon's bed.

18:21.834 --> 18:22.735
What happened to him?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.237
Did he not pull through?

18:24.271 --> 18:26.706
He was stable last time
I checked in on him.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.792
Jim. You're awake.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.027
Yeah. So I keep hearing.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.463
This all feels
like a bad dream.

18:50.497 --> 18:51.764
What are you doing here?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.842
Do they know you're up and
about? You mean Lucas and Mira?

18:53.866 --> 18:56.836
Yeah, I mean... You were
Taylor's right hand.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.037
They'll be looking for you.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.473
Why are you working
for them, Malcolm?

19:02.008 --> 19:05.111
Why am I...?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.180
I've been pressed into service.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.948
You'll notice my
assistant McCormick

19:08.981 --> 19:10.350
isn't in the lab with me.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.920
See that window?
That's where they put his head

19:13.953 --> 19:15.288
when I refused to help.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.357
Then they let him
bleed out on the floor.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.263
Malcolm.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.632
I'm sorry about McCormick.

19:25.665 --> 19:29.669
But if you fix that terminus,
they'll start shipments to 2149.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.671
They get a taste of what
Terra Nova has to offer,

19:31.704 --> 19:33.440
they'll send more men,
and more equipment,

19:33.473 --> 19:35.675
and we won't stand a
chance. Yeah, I know, I know.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.377
That's why I'm working
as slowly as I can.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.012
Fortunately for us,
as brilliant a physicist

19:40.046 --> 19:41.614
as Lucas is, he's no engineer,

19:41.648 --> 19:43.883
so he hasn't...
quite caught on yet.

19:43.916 --> 19:47.854
That's good. Well, keep...
I don't know, dragging it out.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.290
Hopefully it'll buy us
some time to find Taylor.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.725
Did you hear...?

19:55.995 --> 19:57.564
We've got a problem.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.532
Shannon's Taylor's go-to.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.068
He's smart, capable...
he's dangerous.

20:02.101 --> 20:03.612
And he might just know
where Taylor is.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.938
By all means,
we should talk to him.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.844
Shannon.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.014
Shannon!

20:15.047 --> 20:16.749
Hey! We're talking to you.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.851
He can't hear you.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.321
The blast took
most of his hearing.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.924
Hey, Jim?

20:24.957 --> 20:28.027
It's okay.
Here they are.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.929
I've adjusted them for you.

20:29.962 --> 20:33.300
Now remember, stay off
your feet as much as you can.

20:36.303 --> 20:38.471
Where's my father?

20:41.308 --> 20:44.010
Where's... Taylor?

20:44.043 --> 20:45.978
Taylor?

20:47.213 --> 20:48.848
Lucas Taylor.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.620
I know who you are.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.854
I know who you are!

20:54.887 --> 20:57.524
Apparently the, uh, concussion
caused a sub-cranial swelling.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.426
I don't think he
even knows where he is.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.828
Yeah, he's not going to
help us find my father.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.497
Malcolm! I want an update
on how the terminus is coming.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.998
Step it up, or the next head

21:06.032 --> 21:07.934
through a window
is yours.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.268
Hey. Jim?

21:09.302 --> 21:10.102
Go home.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.472
Be with your family.

21:48.174 --> 21:50.510
Little early, isn't it?

21:53.646 --> 21:56.048
Any luck getting
a signal to Hope Plaza?

21:56.082 --> 21:57.384
Just got off with our employers.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.386
Things couldn't be going
better on their end.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.454
As far as the general
public's concerned,

22:01.488 --> 22:03.231
there was a containment
breach at Hope Plaza,

22:03.255 --> 22:05.458
and the place
had to be evacuated.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.027
The media's reporting
it'll take years

22:08.060 --> 22:09.161
to clean up the radiation.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.039
Which means, as soon as
the terminus is up and running,

22:11.063 --> 22:13.342
we can start shipping everything
we mine through Hope Plaza,

22:13.366 --> 22:15.368
and no one will ever
be the wiser.

22:15.402 --> 22:19.171
Our employers did have
one request...

22:19.205 --> 22:21.273
Of you, as a matter of fact.

22:21.307 --> 22:25.445
I take it you're familiar with
an area called the Badlands?

22:25.478 --> 22:27.246
They'd like you to
take a little trip.

22:27.279 --> 22:30.116
What for?
There's nothing out there.

22:30.149 --> 22:33.152
Ours is not
to question why.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.188
Oh, if you'll excuse me.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.124
You can go.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.329
You wanted to see me?

22:43.362 --> 22:46.298
You betrayed me
to my father.

22:46.332 --> 22:47.967
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.902
I did, didn't I?

22:53.440 --> 22:57.143
I should make
an example of you, but...

22:58.010 --> 23:02.882
I've decided to forgive you
instead, because...

23:02.915 --> 23:04.684
I understand.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.454
He's like a father
to you, isn't he?

23:10.790 --> 23:11.824
Yeah, you could say that.

23:11.858 --> 23:14.427
Well, you know what
that makes us, then...

23:14.461 --> 23:17.864
Brother and sister.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.869
And how could I ever
hurt my sister?

23:26.673 --> 23:29.041
Don't betray me again.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.613
Next time, I won't be
so forgiving.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.622
All right, move!

23:47.694 --> 23:49.796
I hate them.
I hate all of them.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.397
Shh! Easy.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.899
Take it easy.

23:54.634 --> 23:55.735
We've got to do something.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.208
We've gotta find
a way to fight back.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.908
Oh, you want to help?

24:01.941 --> 24:04.376
Go ask Boylan for
your job back.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.612
Why?

24:05.645 --> 24:09.849
A lot of these Phoenix guys
hang out at his place.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.719
Drunken soldiers
talking shop.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.187
You never know what
you might overhear.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.775
Okay, judging by the
number of entry wounds,

24:35.808 --> 24:37.644
this should be
the last bullet.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.951
Looks intact.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.087
Can I go ahead and
close him up, then?

24:52.024 --> 24:53.960
Dr. Shannon?

24:54.961 --> 24:56.195
So what am I looking
at here?

24:56.228 --> 24:58.206
I pulled a couple of bullets
from a Phoenix soldier

24:58.230 --> 25:00.600
they brought in after
a skirmish with Taylor's men.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.102
Look, I noticed this.

25:07.807 --> 25:10.910
That isn't a serial number.
Someone did that by hand.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.945
Yeah, so I went back
and I checked

25:12.979 --> 25:13.946
all the other bullets
we retrieved,

25:13.980 --> 25:15.357
and they've all got
the same number,

25:15.381 --> 25:16.749
hand-etched in the metal.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.624
Taylor, you sneaky bastard.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.258
You finally checked in.

25:27.894 --> 25:31.130
They're map coordinates.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.699
A rendezvous point.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.136
Except now, I gotta figure out
a way past those guards

25:37.169 --> 25:39.138
and get outside the gates.

25:41.741 --> 25:45.144
Hey, what...!
That's-that's my rover!

25:45.177 --> 25:46.177
And that's my army.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.048
All right!

25:49.081 --> 25:50.717
See this bug bite?

25:50.750 --> 25:53.019
Yeah, I can't even
begin to describe

25:53.052 --> 25:54.921
the insect that
did this to me.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.323
Some kind of winged
spider-snake.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.635
What about the pyro-sonic?
Is it loaded up and ready to go?

25:59.659 --> 26:00.893
Yes, sir.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.995
Now, careful with it.
It's the only one we've got.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.239
Damn thing growled
at me, Lucas.

26:04.263 --> 26:07.233
Pretty sure bugs aren't
supposed to growl.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.266
Let's go!

26:23.182 --> 26:24.984
Why are we stopped?

26:29.288 --> 26:30.322
Hey, move out of the way.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.191
The damn motor's dead again.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.259
Third time this month.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.293
You have to move now!

26:34.326 --> 26:35.337
Hey, what the hell
you doing?

26:35.361 --> 26:36.829
Come on!
What are you thinking?

26:36.863 --> 26:37.964
The guy's in a wheelchair!

26:37.997 --> 26:39.699
Cut him a break,
why don't you?

26:39.732 --> 26:41.033
Move out of the way.

26:41.067 --> 26:43.903
Hey, mister, what... have
you got anything

26:43.936 --> 26:45.981
compassionate about you?
This guy is in a wheelchair.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.174
Stand back.
All right.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.809
That's cool...

27:31.183 --> 27:33.219
Dr. Taylor.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.254
Mr. Weaver.

27:39.225 --> 27:42.061
So what are we looking at here?

27:42.094 --> 27:44.096
'Cause all I can see
is a bunch of trees.

27:44.130 --> 27:47.566
This whole valley is rich
with meteoric ore.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.702
There are impact craters
everywhere.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.279
Just can't see 'em
because of the canopy.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.972
How much is out there?

27:53.005 --> 27:54.406
Couple hundred
thousand tons.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.908
- Easy.
- See, Weaver?

27:55.942 --> 27:57.777
Told you, you were
going to be a rich man.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.846
My own dome.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.981
That's what I'm going
to do with my share.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.750
Buy my very own dome.

28:06.285 --> 28:07.920
Huh. Look at that thing.

28:07.954 --> 28:10.389
Of course, the only problem
we have is the wildlife.

28:10.422 --> 28:13.993
It's not safe to get started
until we clear them out.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.362
After what those Carnos
did to the terminus,

28:16.395 --> 28:17.764
can't be too careful.

28:33.579 --> 28:36.448
There.
One less problem.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.685
That was a brachiosaurus.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.552
They're harmless.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.621
Whatever.
What's the plan?

28:42.654 --> 28:44.857
Plant the charge
about ten klicks in.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.926
Detonate from this ridge.

28:46.959 --> 28:50.096
And boom, the blast will strip
the entire valley

28:50.129 --> 28:51.898
of all foliage and wildlife,

28:51.931 --> 28:53.232
so we can mine it unobstructed.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.635
Today is just a hint
of what's to come.

28:56.668 --> 29:00.672
With just ten pyro-sonics, we
can strip half the continent.

29:00.706 --> 29:02.041
That's what I like to hear.

29:02.074 --> 29:05.344
Be one hell of a barbecue
down there, huh?

29:24.897 --> 29:26.298
Mr. Shannon!

29:26.332 --> 29:28.000
Reynolds.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.936
We've been keeping
an eye on this spot for days,

29:29.969 --> 29:32.038
hoping that someone
would get our message.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.340
How's Maddy? She okay?

29:34.373 --> 29:35.641
The whole family's safe.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.674
Give me your comm, 'cause
I need to talk to Taylor.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.380
We got a situation.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.261
You say they've got some kind
of a pyro-sonic charge.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.495
They're planning to
detonate it

29:56.528 --> 29:57.873
from a ridge just south
of Triple Junction.

29:57.897 --> 29:58.898
Excuse me, sir.

29:58.931 --> 29:59.798
Talk to me, Reilly.

29:59.832 --> 30:01.167
If there's using
a remote trigger,

30:01.200 --> 30:03.311
that means we can trace the
signal straight to the charge.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.203
If we get you there,

30:04.236 --> 30:06.005
can you defuse
the damn thing?

30:06.038 --> 30:07.139
Sooner the better.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.307
All right,
let's go, people.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.342
Hey, I'm glad to see
you're in one piece.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.811
Likewise.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.421
All right, it's armed.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.491
I'll let her rip, once we've
cleared the blast radius.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.493
Very good.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.361
All right, let's go!

30:32.031 --> 30:34.200
Yeah, we're
heading back now.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.302
Copy that.
Standing by.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.577
All right, let's get this done.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.380
If they get up to that ridge,
they're gonna set this sucker off.

30:48.414 --> 30:49.015
Reilly...

30:49.048 --> 30:50.282
I'm on it, sir.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.427
Never seen a decompiler
like this one before.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.130
Must be Russo-Chinese.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.665
Not a lot of time for
a learning curve here, Reilly.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.533
Can you do it?

31:07.566 --> 31:09.201
Of course, sir.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.612
Lucas, come in.
It's Weaver.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.114
Go ahead.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.050
Infra-red shows
movement near the charge.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.485
Please tell me
you're still down there.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.319
It's my father.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.321
I knew it.
Blow it, Weaver! Set it off!

31:29.355 --> 31:31.099
Whoa! Hang on!
We're still in the blast zone!

31:31.123 --> 31:33.459
Weaver, hold on.
How much farther?

31:33.492 --> 31:35.794
Another... three klicks.

31:35.827 --> 31:38.397
What's that?

31:38.430 --> 31:39.298
It's all right.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.133
Just letting me know
it's powering up.

31:41.167 --> 31:42.901
Getting ready
to explode.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.070
Drive faster.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.175
And how long before
it's... you know...

31:49.208 --> 31:50.276
not ready to explode?

31:50.309 --> 31:52.211
Corporal?

31:52.244 --> 31:54.981
If everyone could just
shut up for a second.

31:55.681 --> 31:56.582
Sir.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.126
Reynolds,
they're approaching the ridge.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.351
Copy that.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.420
They're almost clear
of the blast zone, sir.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.621
Fire up the Rhino.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.556
One way or the other,
we're leaving in a hurry.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.069
All right, we're
almost clear, Weaver.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.394
Just blow the damn thing.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.434
Just a few more seconds.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.712
Done.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.351
What the hell happened?

32:32.384 --> 32:35.054
Either this
detonator's broken,

32:35.087 --> 32:37.023
or your father defused
the bomb.

32:38.557 --> 32:41.060
Good job, Corporal.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.466
Secure the pyro-sonic
and let's go.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.709
Incoming!

33:16.128 --> 33:17.896
Everybody all right
back there?

33:17.929 --> 33:18.930
Yes, sir.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.432
All good, sir.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.707
Son of a bitch!

33:34.713 --> 33:37.849
We lost 26
before the colony fell.

33:37.883 --> 33:41.019
26 dead?

33:41.053 --> 33:43.322
We lost two our
first night here

33:43.355 --> 33:46.225
before we had a chance
to secure the perimeter.

33:46.258 --> 33:49.595
Carnotaurs... they got
Bailey and Gonzalez.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.163
He was 22 years old.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.865
Good kid.
Good soldier.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.201
As I understand it,

33:55.234 --> 33:58.804
Gonzalez was engaged
to be married.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.272
How's Wash holding up?

34:00.306 --> 34:02.141
She's been better.

34:02.174 --> 34:05.211
She, uh, she feels like
she let you down.

34:05.244 --> 34:10.248
Nah. She made the only decision
she could

34:10.282 --> 34:11.750
surrender the colony.

34:11.783 --> 34:12.684
Tell her I said so.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.120
I will.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.155
You should be getting back
before they miss you.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.657
Take this.

34:18.690 --> 34:19.625
Stay in touch.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.592
I got it on
a rotating frequency.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.763
There's no way they can
lock in on it.

34:24.795 --> 34:28.266
So, uh, what now,
Commander?

34:30.469 --> 34:32.638
We just keep on
hitting 'em.

34:32.670 --> 34:36.141
We won this round,
but this ain't over.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.244
Not by a long shot.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.822
Train station...

34:51.857 --> 34:52.924
Found him
wandering around

34:52.958 --> 34:54.101
the wrong side
of the perimeter.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.128
Where's the train station?
It's okay, Dad.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.572
It's not there anymore.
Let me help you.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.532
Next time, keep an eye on him
or he comes home in a body bag.

35:00.566 --> 35:03.369
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

35:09.541 --> 35:10.676
You okay?

35:10.709 --> 35:13.879
That was too close.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.086
I'm the one
who found you.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.223
After the explosion,
I mean.

35:24.256 --> 35:27.459
You were lying so still. I...

35:35.767 --> 35:37.369
I haven't been that scared

35:37.403 --> 35:39.671
since the day we first came
to Terra Nova

35:39.705 --> 35:43.475
and they pulled you
aside at Hope Plaza.

35:45.944 --> 35:49.481
Jim, I was so sure I was never
going to see you again.

35:49.515 --> 35:52.684
But you did see me again.

35:52.718 --> 35:56.488
'Cause no matter how bad
things get...

35:58.690 --> 36:00.759
you can always count on me
showing up...

36:00.792 --> 36:02.428
right here every time.

36:02.461 --> 36:06.031
'Cause I make it my
mission in life

36:06.064 --> 36:09.935
to always find my way
back to you.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.926
Not again.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.194
Evening patrol,
three dead, four wounded.

37:43.228 --> 37:44.730
How many of theirs
did we get?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.465
None, sir.
They saw us coming.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.269
Someone's helping my father.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.873
Shannon,

37:54.906 --> 37:56.975
table four needs a refill.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.918
Another Shannon, huh?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.820
You seem to be everywhere.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.960
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

38:14.993 --> 38:16.795
You look sad.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.229
You didn't, um,

38:18.263 --> 38:20.065
you didn't lose a friend
in all this,

38:20.098 --> 38:22.167
did you?

38:22.200 --> 38:24.302
Buck up, kid.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.440
Here's a terra.

38:28.474 --> 38:29.908
Buy yourself a new friend.

38:32.243 --> 38:33.412
There she is!

38:33.445 --> 38:34.680
My beautiful sister!

38:34.713 --> 38:35.914
Join me.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.920
Do you mind?
Three's a crowd.

38:47.192 --> 38:49.160
Hi.

38:49.194 --> 38:53.599
So, I asked you here 'cause

38:53.632 --> 38:56.134
I'm curious
about something...

38:56.167 --> 38:59.571
our father.

38:59.605 --> 39:03.108
What did he say when
he found out that you

39:03.141 --> 39:04.776
were spying for Mira

39:04.810 --> 39:07.546
in exchange for
your mother's life?

39:07.579 --> 39:09.548
Did he forgive you?

39:11.583 --> 39:14.820
Not that it's any
of your business,

39:14.853 --> 39:17.556
but he hasn't said
a word to me.

39:20.726 --> 39:23.795
I can imagine how much
that must hurt you.

39:25.130 --> 39:29.267
Oh, he just needs time.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.470
Sooner or later
I know we'll talk.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.539
I wouldn't be so sure.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.444
I've been waiting my whole
life for him to forgive me.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.479
Forgive you for what?

39:42.280 --> 39:44.983
For being born, dear sister.

39:46.017 --> 39:50.589
For the unforgivable
act of being born.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.171
Please don't do that.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.940
You are so beautiful.

40:08.974 --> 40:11.977
Okay.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.012
Please let go.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.515
Stop it!

40:18.083 --> 40:19.417
Excuse me.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.160
Come on!

40:33.031 --> 40:34.666
Hold him up.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.136
Lucas, Lucas, no, no!

40:42.373 --> 40:43.875
So I think I've figured out

40:43.909 --> 40:45.787
what's up with all the activity
around the perimeter fence.

40:45.811 --> 40:48.714
They've installed some kind
of new detection grid.

40:48.747 --> 40:52.884
So we're gonna need a Phoenix
access card to disable it.

40:52.918 --> 40:53.918
Mr. Shannon!

40:55.420 --> 40:56.655
It's Josh.

41:04.730 --> 41:05.997
All right, all right!

41:06.031 --> 41:07.098
Enough.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.204
I got to say...

41:14.573 --> 41:16.307
I'm a little hurt.

41:16.341 --> 41:18.076
I've been nothing

41:18.109 --> 41:21.179
if not generous in my treatment
of you people.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.848
You brought this
on yourself.

41:22.881 --> 41:24.215
And now
I'm gonna have

41:24.249 --> 41:26.184
to make an example of you.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.896
Search him.

42:15.466 --> 42:17.869
I have to say,
Sheriff,

42:17.903 --> 42:22.073
the limp, very convincing.

42:22.107 --> 42:23.875
My father would have
been impressed.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.445
You, uh,

42:27.478 --> 42:28.980
did you have a good
laugh about it

42:29.014 --> 42:30.548
the last time
you saw him?

42:30.582 --> 42:33.785
I don't know
what you're talking about.

42:33.819 --> 42:35.821
No?

42:40.225 --> 42:42.560
Transponder.

42:46.732 --> 42:49.434
So that's how
my father always knew

42:49.467 --> 42:51.102
when and where
to hit us.

42:51.136 --> 42:53.872
Planting these on our
vehicles, Shannon?

42:53.905 --> 42:55.641
Clever.

42:58.543 --> 43:00.345
Where's my father?

43:04.750 --> 43:07.118
Where is he?!

43:15.293 --> 43:17.328
Maybe I can...

43:18.296 --> 43:20.666
help you remember.

43:23.334 --> 43:25.070
Take him to the brig.

43:30.809 --> 43:32.610
Both of them.
