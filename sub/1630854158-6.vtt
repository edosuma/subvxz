11:53.196 --> 11:56.289
<i> The super-killer murders</i>
<i> by writing names</i>

11:56.291 --> 11:59.884
<i> on some kind of</i>
<i> supernatural book,</i>

11:59.886 --> 12:01.886
<i> or perhaps tome.</i>

12:01.888 --> 12:04.948
What the wh-- How?

12:04.950 --> 12:06.891
Well, I know I'll sleep easier

12:06.893 --> 12:09.561
once they catch
this super-killer.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.880
Wait, I know. I'll kill L.

12:12.882 --> 12:14.791
Oh, but I thought
you only killed

12:14.793 --> 12:16.292
to save the planet.

12:16.294 --> 12:19.963
Killing L will only
save yourself from jail.

12:19.965 --> 12:24.108
I don't have time to explain why
what I do is good and pure.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.803
L, punched to death

12:26.805 --> 12:29.806
by kangaroo.

12:29.808 --> 12:31.307
(scoffs)
It's not gonna work

12:31.309 --> 12:33.493
unless you have his whole name.

12:33.495 --> 12:37.922
(groans)
How can I find out L's name?

12:37.924 --> 12:41.575
Wait a minute,
I recognize that L.

12:41.577 --> 12:44.504
I know who you are.

12:44.506 --> 12:48.099
It's not L, it's EL,

12:48.101 --> 12:51.010
as in El Barto.

12:51.012 --> 12:53.271
BART:
Took you long enough.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.590
How did you figure out
how I killed all those people?

12:56.592 --> 12:58.518
I found out about
your stupid book

12:58.520 --> 13:02.263
by reading an even stupider
book; your diary.

13:02.265 --> 13:05.174
Your little murder spree
was a welcome break from,

13:05.176 --> 13:07.360
"Janey is so mean to me."

13:07.362 --> 13:09.937
I'm not a murderer.
I'm justice

13:09.939 --> 13:11.956
It was a justice spree.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.125
I'm saving the world.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.443
And I can't let you
stop me. I can't.

13:16.445 --> 13:19.798
Lisa, you're actually
gonna kill me?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.490
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

13:21.492 --> 13:23.876
I almost killed
my own brother.

13:23.878 --> 13:25.953
The<i> Death Tome</i> corrupted me.

13:25.955 --> 13:28.698
The stain on my soul
will never be...

13:28.700 --> 13:30.809
Oh, so now you're trying
to bore me to death?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.293
(Lisa grunts)

13:32.295 --> 13:34.813
-Crushed by...

13:59.230 --> 14:01.564
Well, you are a god of death.

14:01.566 --> 14:02.990
You could kill Janey.

14:02.992 --> 14:04.901
Would that make you
feel better?

14:04.903 --> 14:06.660
LISA:
No.

14:06.662 --> 14:08.429
Maybe.

14:13.428 --> 14:16.688
This is the snack holder,
where I can put my beverage,

14:16.690 --> 14:18.598

14:18.600 --> 14:21.693

of possums in here.

14:27.759 --> 14:29.701
-I call the big one Bitey.
-I call the big one Bitey.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.018
-Ha!
-Yes!

14:31.020 --> 14:32.929
(chuckles)
We all call him Bitey.

14:32.931 --> 14:36.099
Dude, dude, what if
Homer was drunk during Monorail?

14:36.101 --> 14:38.025
Yeah. Come here, dude.

Look, we've got a bus full
of Australian superfans coming.

Let's just wipe his brain, okay?

16:20.981 --> 16:22.538

16:22.540 --> 16:25.132
Look, Monorail Homer,
your programming

16:25.134 --> 16:27.819

hurt a human, okay?

16:27.821 --> 16:31.638

So, we've got to wake up
the rest of the family

17:38.132 --> 17:39.298

17:39.300 --> 17:42.226

17:42.228 --> 17:44.470
We can get out
through the main entrance,

17:44.472 --> 17:46.564
but we'll have to make it
across the park

17:46.566 --> 17:47.899
without being detected.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.883
Should we wake up
a Grampa robot?

17:49.885 --> 17:51.644
No time.
