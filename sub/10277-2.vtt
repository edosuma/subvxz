WEBVTT

00:04.971 --> 00:06.198
Previously on E.R.

00:06.199 --> 00:07.249
And if it is positive?

00:07.250 --> 00:10.409
Then we need a foster family willing
to take on a child of color with HIV.

00:10.410 --> 00:14.743
Not only is Dr Anspaugh quitting. Dr Romano
is the front-runner to take his place.

00:14.744 --> 00:16.684
You'd support him as chief of staff?

00:16.685 --> 00:19.084
I think It's only fair that we give him
all the support that we can.

00:19.582 --> 00:21.189
I thought maybe we'd get a drink
or something.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.423
We're here to talk about
your child's needs.

00:23.424 --> 00:24.529
He needs to be with his mother.

00:24.530 --> 00:26.202
He needs to be with his father.

00:26.203 --> 00:28.336
They are not sure if I'm a good doctor.

00:28.371 --> 00:31.727
I've just been appointed the new
permanent chief of the Emergency Department.

00:31.728 --> 00:33.034
Will you marry me?

00:33.135 --> 00:34.894
Dr. Greene's mother has died.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.222
6x02 "LAST RITES"

00:47.875 --> 00:50.266
41-year-old male. Grand mal seizure.

00:50.344 --> 00:53.531
- Any history?
- He's post ictal.

00:53.797 --> 00:56.288
- What's open?
- Curtain 3. I think.

00:56.508 --> 00:57.538
Coming through!

00:57.717 --> 00:59.507
- Can I help you?
- No.

00:59.718 --> 01:03.668
- Draw 10 of Ativan. Give 2 now.
- Need a Dilantin level.

01:04.763 --> 01:07.634
Did you mess with my IV?
Look at it.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.428
I didn't touch it.

01:09.644 --> 01:13.557
If the bag is empty,
you ask them to change it.

01:15.856 --> 01:18.063
Did you see my wallet?

01:18.234 --> 01:20.310
Mr. Parker, stop worrying.

01:20.735 --> 01:23.404
Four units of packed cells, chest film.

01:23.571 --> 01:25.149
- Where's Benton?
- Coming.

01:25.365 --> 01:28.282
We need him.
We need a Foley and an NG.

01:33.872 --> 01:35.994
Okay, lift your tongue.

01:37.416 --> 01:38.744
That should help.

01:38.958 --> 01:42.162
I'm in. Set me up for a chest tube.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

01:52.720 --> 01:54.593
What time are you off?

01:56.098 --> 01:58.588
Hey, what are you doing here?
It's almost midnight.

01:58.809 --> 02:01.381
What time are you off?

02:02.895 --> 02:04.093
Now.

02:07.566 --> 02:10.815
- I'm going now.
- Thank you, Mrs. Anderson.

02:11.026 --> 02:13.327
I put the nice tablecloth in the washer.

02:13.362 --> 02:14.939
And you should tumble dry it on low.

02:15.281 --> 02:18.446
And if you need anything yo call me,
because my number's there on the fridge.

02:18.616 --> 02:19.945
I will.

02:20.118 --> 02:21.492
And, Mark...

02:22.119 --> 02:23.779
...I'm really sorry.

02:24.038 --> 02:27.157
- She was a lovely woman.
- Yeah. I know.

02:27.832 --> 02:30.453
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

02:56.856 --> 03:00.306
You're not afraid about
waking up the neighbors?

03:00.484 --> 03:02.772
Harold's deaf as a post.

03:02.986 --> 03:05.691
- They all leave?
- Yeah.

03:06.030 --> 03:07.275
Good.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.648
What are you making?

03:09.824 --> 03:13.408
I promised your mother
I'd build her a linen chest.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.694
Okay.

03:17.747 --> 03:18.992
Good night.

03:24.962 --> 03:27.583
That was a good speech you gave today.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.664
Those things you said
about your mother.

03:37.306 --> 03:39.097
I had good material.

03:42.977 --> 03:45.053
The color guard was nice, Dad.

03:50.900 --> 03:51.930
You okay?

03:52.527 --> 03:54.982
Depends what "okay" means.

03:56.071 --> 03:59.486
You want me to stick around
a little longer? A few days?

03:59.698 --> 04:01.856
Rachel loves San Diego.

04:07.663 --> 04:09.123
Dad?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.664
It doesn't seem real, Mark.

04:15.212 --> 04:17.833
I buried my wife today.

05:13.759 --> 05:15.503
Fun stuff, huh?

05:15.970 --> 05:17.380
So, you get a look at the bastards?

05:17.554 --> 05:19.593
Skaters all look the same.

05:19.764 --> 05:22.517
- Dr. Malucci?
- It's Dr. Dave to you, Lucy.

05:22.725 --> 05:23.757
No new fractures.

05:23.935 --> 05:26.223
Jeez, it certainly look like you
banged up your chin before.

05:26.437 --> 05:29.806
They don't like how I dress. Last time
they slammed my head in a car door.

05:29.841 --> 05:30.863
Like they're the height of fashion.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.264
Hasn't your principal
done anything about this?

05:33.442 --> 05:34.852
Where did you go to school?

05:35.068 --> 05:37.559
Ok buddy, I'll come back and stitch you up.

05:37.779 --> 05:41.777
Mr. Zito, the COPD'er, is retaining.
Can I decrease his O-2?

05:41.950 --> 05:43.740
- Sure. Why not?
- Two liters?

05:43.951 --> 05:47.154
Dave? Excuse me.
Did you call Plastics on that lip?

05:47.371 --> 05:50.407
- Oh, no I got it.
- If it's through-and-through...

05:50.623 --> 05:53.457
- ... we usually call Plastics.
- He already has a scar-

05:53.625 --> 05:56.413
- All the more reason.
- Two liters, okay?

05:56.628 --> 05:58.953
- What?
- Should I decrease his O-2?

05:59.172 --> 06:03.168
Uh, I don't know. Crank it down.
If he turns blue, crank it back up.

06:03.383 --> 06:05.257
- You're kidding, right?
- No, purple ain't good.

06:05.469 --> 06:08.138
Just keep his pulse ox above 90.

06:09.263 --> 06:11.837
Hey, it's Jackie Joyner.

06:12.058 --> 06:15.011
- Hi Jackie, nice spandex.
- Get a life.

06:16.144 --> 06:18.550
- That's good.
- She's hot for me.

06:18.770 --> 06:21.855
- You've been here three days.
- Doesn't take long, bro.

06:22.066 --> 06:25.897
- Your drunk is back.
- I discharged you two hours ago.

06:26.111 --> 06:27.688
You got to know when to hold them.

06:27.903 --> 06:30.180
- He was passed out.
- When did he have time?

06:30.215 --> 06:32.486
You haven't met Vodka Joe?
Some days he's in three times.

06:32.487 --> 06:34.184
You got to know it was her fault.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.583
Should've left his IV in.

06:35.618 --> 06:37.025
Nice of you to bring him back, officer.

06:37.203 --> 06:39.326
Just doing my duty, ma'am.

06:39.538 --> 06:41.032
- You got this?
- Got it.

06:41.206 --> 06:42.534
Thank you.

06:42.957 --> 06:46.408
Hey, sweetheart.
You wanna meet up with a gambler?

06:46.627 --> 06:48.619
Watch it, cowboy. That's my fiancée.

06:48.796 --> 06:49.827
- Reggie-
- What?

06:50.005 --> 06:51.167
Fiancée. You guys engaged?

06:51.381 --> 06:52.757
- Not exactly.
- Pretty much.

06:52.966 --> 06:53.997
Know when to run!

06:54.175 --> 06:56.665
I want to commend
the Surgical Service on their...

06:56.886 --> 07:00.253
timely response and clinical competence.
We had excellent outcomes...

07:00.471 --> 07:01.930
...with no significant delays.

07:02.140 --> 07:06.053
- Can you cover for me?
- I have outpatient clinic.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.099
Yeah, but it's important.

07:08.853 --> 07:10.763
You have something to add, Dr. Benton?

07:12.398 --> 07:13.430
No.

07:14.358 --> 07:17.395
Then please give us the courtesy
of your full attention.

07:19.113 --> 07:23.572
As a final note, you should all offer
Dr. Corday your congratulations...

07:23.907 --> 07:25.600
since most of you will be working with her...

07:25.637 --> 07:27.905
in her new position
as associate chief of surgery.

07:28.078 --> 07:30.400
All departmental concerns
can be funneled through her office...

07:30.494 --> 07:34.112
including O.R schedules, research funding,

07:34.147 --> 07:37.292
committee assignments, etcetera.

07:37.461 --> 07:39.453
Thank you. And have a good day.

07:43.049 --> 07:44.211
Melanoma?

07:44.425 --> 07:48.172
Started as a small mole on her back,
but it was Stage Four.

07:48.386 --> 07:50.129
Metastasized all over.

07:50.346 --> 07:52.588
Liver, lungs, then her brain.

07:52.765 --> 07:56.429
- She failed chemo?
- Six cycles. Then immunotherapy.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.260
Pulse ox 89 on two liters.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.141
There's fluid in her lungs.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.596
Last time it was this bad
they had to drain it.

08:03.773 --> 08:06.609
- Has she had a seizure recently?
- No. Why?

08:06.777 --> 08:09.067
Might explain her
altered mental status.

08:09.145 --> 08:10.788
She's been out of it for the last month.

08:10.816 --> 08:14.189
Her oncologist feels it's due
to the brain mets or liver failure.

08:14.407 --> 08:15.438
I see.

08:15.617 --> 08:18.403
Let's get a chest x-ray,
CBC, PT, PTT.

08:19.953 --> 08:23.951
Look, you should know something.
She doesn't want to go back to the ICU.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.759
She has a "do not resuscitate" order?

08:25.837 --> 08:28.619
I just brought her in because her breathing
and pain seemed to worsen.

08:28.794 --> 08:32.578
- I thought you'd make her comfortable.
- Well, that we can do.

08:32.798 --> 08:36.629
- Oh, Mark. When did you get back?
- Late last night.

08:36.801 --> 08:39.505
- Plane was delayed four hours in San Diego..
- How did it go?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.794
- All right.
- Rough, huh?

08:42.013 --> 08:45.262
- Wow, you grew in a week!
- Thanks, Mark.

08:45.432 --> 08:46.464
Dr. Carter.

08:46.642 --> 08:50.556
- Dr. Greene. Sorry about your mom.
- Thanks. What do you got?

08:50.771 --> 08:53.723
20-year-old girl, end-stage melanoma.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.472
Mark, coffee later?

08:55.482 --> 08:57.973
- You on all day?
- Yeah. I just started.

08:58.152 --> 09:01.816
She's DNR. Her Father just brought her in
because she's altered and in pain.

09:01.988 --> 09:03.102
What's this all about?

09:03.280 --> 09:05.653
What? Oh, that's Dr. Weaver's
new charting system.

09:05.866 --> 09:07.493
What was wrong with the old one?

09:07.568 --> 09:10.821
Actually is kind of cool. See, there's
a separate form for each chief complaint.

09:10.994 --> 09:14.411
- Multiple-choice medicine?
- Yeah, sort of.

09:14.624 --> 09:17.873
Anyway, I was thinking about doing a
toraxentesis or tapping her belly.

09:18.084 --> 09:19.827
- Get a chest x-ray?
- Yeah. They're shooting now.

09:20.044 --> 09:22.366
Right, I'd pull up the old ones
for comparison.

09:22.438 --> 09:24.001
Mark. Welcome back.

09:24.215 --> 09:26.586
Thanks, Kerry. Nice checklist.

09:26.758 --> 09:27.837
Yeah, is great. The T-system.

09:28.051 --> 09:31.004
- I'll train you on it later.
- Can't wait.

09:37.100 --> 09:41.297
Lizzie. It took you 20 minutes
to come and see me.

09:41.312 --> 09:44.182
I'm shocked.
I thought it would be 10, tops.

09:44.398 --> 09:45.441
What's all this about, Robert?

09:45.517 --> 09:48.374
What? No "Thank you I'm honored"
no "I hope I don't dissapoint?

09:48.392 --> 09:49.624
Everyone thinks you're serious.

09:49.716 --> 09:51.628
That's because I am serious, Lizzie.
You know me.

09:51.696 --> 09:53.867
I'm bound to ruffle a few feathers
in this new job.

09:53.939 --> 09:56.778
I need you to smooth things over for me.
Walk with me at the head.

09:56.991 --> 10:00.030
If you wanted to offer me a position
why didn't you ask me privately?

10:00.119 --> 10:02.076
Oh, where's the fun on that.
Besides, I knew you'd take it.

10:02.288 --> 10:05.870
- I haven't taken it.
- Oh, is that a "no"?

10:06.041 --> 10:09.117
I didn't think so. As much as you may view
me as a loathsome toad...

10:09.209 --> 10:12.829
I know your pragmatic and more predictable
your ambitious nature will prevail.

10:12.864 --> 10:14.320
You'll leapfrog five or six years.

10:14.339 --> 10:18.171
- That's not the point.
- The point is, I'm handing it to you.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.550
A fast-track career.
Independence in the O.R.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.419
With the minor annoyance of course
of having to report to me.

10:25.539 --> 10:28.131
I don't view you as a loathsome toad,
Robert.

10:28.350 --> 10:30.591
Well, I can't tell you how happy I am
to hear that, Elisabeth.

10:36.982 --> 10:38.642
There's a smile.

10:39.818 --> 10:41.561
Oh, he's a cutie, huh?

10:41.778 --> 10:45.727
- You're gonna break some hearts.
- Time for his cocktail.

10:45.948 --> 10:49.398
- Any side effects?
- No. He's a trooper.

10:49.576 --> 10:53.276
The pneumonia's cleared up.
He's eating solids.

10:53.496 --> 10:56.698
- Normal white count?
- Yeah, 10,000.

10:58.876 --> 11:03.418
All done. Such a good boy.
I'm gonna miss you.

11:04.504 --> 11:06.247
Is he being discharged?

11:06.464 --> 11:07.924
DCFS is coming.

11:08.091 --> 11:09.586
They found a foster family.

11:09.801 --> 11:12.920
No, he's going to
an Emergency Intake Center.

11:13.095 --> 11:16.927
- He needs one-on-one nurturing.
- Intake's temporary.

11:17.349 --> 11:19.008
I'm sure they'll find someone.

11:19.225 --> 11:22.593
Someone who'll want to adopt an HIV baby?
Her mother is not going to pull through

11:23.103 --> 11:25.179
The mother died yesterday.

11:26.648 --> 11:29.352
- TM's are clear.
- You talk funny.

11:29.567 --> 11:32.770
- Hunter!
- Thank you. Say "ahh."

11:32.987 --> 11:34.979
That's cause he's from very far way.

11:35.197 --> 11:39.028
- How far?
- So far that it's dark there already.

11:39.241 --> 11:43.571
Throat's red, all right. Probably an
upper respiratory infection.

11:43.828 --> 11:48.122
- So he'll need antibiotics?
- No. Just give him lots of fluids.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.743
- Okay.
- I'll come back soon, okay?

11:52.627 --> 11:55.414
- We should do a rapid strep.
- You got it.

11:55.629 --> 11:57.504
- Where are you from?
- Croatia.

11:57.715 --> 11:59.375
Oh. Wow!

12:00.133 --> 12:04.297
- Here's a prescription just in case.
- Great. You forgot Tylenol.

12:04.638 --> 12:06.879
The docs give us an order for fever.

12:07.056 --> 12:08.883
Fevers have a purpose.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.175
They tell us when someone's sick.

12:11.435 --> 12:13.925
It's the body's way to fight infection.

12:14.104 --> 12:15.135
That's good, no?

12:16.022 --> 12:19.638
- I suppose.
- So why stop it?

12:19.857 --> 12:21.482
Make the kid feel better?

12:24.320 --> 12:25.482
Okay.

12:27.655 --> 12:30.325
Got an LOL in 3. Needs a nurse.

12:30.534 --> 12:33.487
Not much I can do for her.
How you doing?

12:33.994 --> 12:37.271
I told the mediator I'm not trying
to take Reece from Carla.

12:37.406 --> 12:39.217
But I can't let her take him.

12:39.252 --> 12:41.032
Do you think she's doing this to hurt you?

12:41.109 --> 12:42.740
She doesn't care.

12:42.961 --> 12:45.368
Do you care about her situation?

12:46.672 --> 12:51.132
- What is it?
- I've never talked to a therapist.

12:52.176 --> 12:55.592
Dr. Benton, I'm not here
to psychoanalyze you.

12:55.804 --> 12:58.591
I need to assess the family
for the court.

12:58.807 --> 13:01.973
We both love our son.
But she wants him...

13:02.185 --> 13:04.307
...for her new husband's career.

13:04.520 --> 13:08.564
- How do you feel about Roger?
- He's a decent guy, I guess.

13:08.773 --> 13:10.054
- Good to Reece?
- Yes.

13:10.275 --> 13:12.730
- Loves him?
- Why are we talking about Roger. Who cares?

13:12.944 --> 13:18.282
- This is about me, Reece and Carla.
- Like it or not, he factors into this.

13:18.574 --> 13:22.356
How do you thing you'd deal with it if Carla
was able to take Reece out of the country?

13:22.576 --> 13:25.410
- That's not gonna happen.
- If it did?

13:29.415 --> 13:33.708
The two most recent chest films
are June 28th and July 17th.

13:33.877 --> 13:36.119
I'll take the folder.
Congratulations!

13:36.338 --> 13:38.460
- You're in the loop.
- So it's true.

13:38.673 --> 13:40.878
- I have a patient.
- Aye, aye, chief.

13:41.091 --> 13:42.205
Please.

13:42.426 --> 13:43.624
Here you go.

13:52.351 --> 13:53.893
Vanessa?

13:56.895 --> 13:59.517
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

14:00.441 --> 14:04.023
You're in the hospital.
The nursing home sent you over.

14:06.653 --> 14:08.279
One of the nurses brought this.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.854
She said you always have it.

14:11.074 --> 14:13.743
- Maggie.
- I think so.

14:16.954 --> 14:19.326
I wish I kept a journal.

14:19.539 --> 14:22.872
It's not mine. Paul kept it.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.242
I just like it near me.

14:26.753 --> 14:29.374
Is that the sacred heart?

14:30.548 --> 14:35.423
- You're Catholic.
- Eastern Orthodox. Sort of.

14:35.636 --> 14:37.961
I hope it works out for you.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.923
I'm sorry?

14:40.099 --> 14:44.593
In the end it doesn't help much.
It didn't help Paul.

14:44.810 --> 14:49.187
Hard to believe in a God
that does that to a man like him.

14:50.815 --> 14:52.439
Too bad.

14:53.776 --> 14:56.527
Heaven sounds good right now.

14:59.614 --> 15:03.112
- Would you like to talk to a priest?
- Oh, God, no.

15:03.325 --> 15:05.733
- We have them on call.
- Don't trouble yourself.

15:05.953 --> 15:09.403
- It's really no bother.
- Really, don't.

15:11.582 --> 15:13.622
- Bob. Hi.
- Hi.

15:13.793 --> 15:16.745
- Did you get my page?
- No, sorry. What's up?

15:16.961 --> 15:19.203
You're discharging the Ortega baby?

15:19.380 --> 15:20.410
I couldn't find anybody.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.505
- I'll take him.
- What?

15:22.716 --> 15:26.048
- I'll take him home.
- You're a licensed foster parent?

15:26.260 --> 15:27.340
No, but I can become one.

15:28.736 --> 15:30.761
That's nice of you, but I'm affraid
is not very realistic.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.973
- Why not?
- You have to be screened and trained.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.261
I can do all of that and take care
of him in the mean time.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.476
It has to be better than Intake.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.936
- He needs a mom.
- You have children?

15:43.233 --> 15:45.806
- No. I can focus on him.
- Support system?

15:45.985 --> 15:49.568
- I can do it.
- I don't know. It's not policy.

15:50.197 --> 15:51.987
Maybe it'll be a good solution...

15:52.156 --> 15:54.482
until I find a foster parent.

15:54.659 --> 15:59.119
- Or until I get licensed.
- Let me look into it. No promises.

16:03.791 --> 16:05.202
Hey, Reece.

16:05.418 --> 16:08.038
How are you doing? Hey, Carla.

16:08.253 --> 16:10.126
- Peter.
- Ms. Simmons?

16:10.339 --> 16:12.414
- I'm Debra Wexler.
- Hi.

16:12.632 --> 16:14.541
Whenever you're ready.

16:14.759 --> 16:17.711
Go ahead. It's pretty painless.

16:17.927 --> 16:21.261
Go ahead, Reece. Go to Mommy.
Go ahead.

16:22.223 --> 16:25.307
Oh, I know. It's okay.
Hey, man. It's okay.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.933
Hey, Reece, I'll see you later, huh?

16:29.146 --> 16:32.977
I'll see you later. I love you.
I know. I love you.

16:41.572 --> 16:45.024
Loculated fluid around the lungs
and lots of mets.

16:45.243 --> 16:46.902
Is this going to help?

16:47.744 --> 16:49.783
Her belly was pretty tense.

16:49.995 --> 16:54.207
It'll relieve some pain
and take pressure off the diaphragm.

16:54.375 --> 16:56.746
She'll still have trouble breathing.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.451
- It's three liters.
- Okay.

16:59.671 --> 17:01.710
I'll take this to the lab.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.089
Is there a pay phone?
I'll call her mother.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.843
Sure. I'll take you.

17:10.680 --> 17:15.387
I'll be right back, okay?
I'll be right back. Okay.

17:24.358 --> 17:25.602
You didn't call.

17:28.861 --> 17:31.148
Sorry, I got in late.

17:32.490 --> 17:35.110
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:35.575 --> 17:38.528
- How's your dad?
- We'll see.

17:39.911 --> 17:43.861
He was shaken up. But I don't know.

17:44.582 --> 17:45.993
Numb.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.078
Mom was okay.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.003
And then, boom.
Heart attack.

17:54.590 --> 17:58.006
It's gonna take a while
for it to sink in for him.

17:59.094 --> 18:00.375
And you?

18:03.013 --> 18:04.756
I don't know.

18:06.725 --> 18:09.761
I did hear a vicious rumor about you.

18:09.936 --> 18:11.962
Really? Which one?

18:11.979 --> 18:14.814
It was actually
more of an announcement.

18:15.024 --> 18:17.395
It was a shock to me as anyone.

18:17.609 --> 18:18.889
What is he up to?

18:19.110 --> 18:24.401
- Robert has to be dramatic.
- Yeah, but why'd he pick you?

18:24.948 --> 18:28.945
I don't know. Perhaps he thinks
I'm a talented surgeon.

18:29.620 --> 18:32.075
That's not what I meant.

18:33.914 --> 18:37.364
- You won't take it, will you?
- I was considering it.

18:38.877 --> 18:40.288
- What?
- Nothing.

18:41.629 --> 18:43.585
So, I'm going to have to deal with Romano.

18:43.797 --> 18:47.795
He's a small price to pay
for such an advancement.

18:48.010 --> 18:50.629
- If you say so.
- Stop it.

18:50.803 --> 18:53.922
If you feel the need to express
an opinion at least articulate it.

18:54.140 --> 18:56.890
Fine. You can't trust that guy.

18:57.475 --> 19:00.144
He screwed you in the past.
He's not going to hesitate to do it again.

19:00.310 --> 19:04.604
- But I think you know that.
- Yes and it's my problem, isn't it?

19:05.273 --> 19:07.064
I think it will be.

19:11.821 --> 19:15.319
You're on soup and milk shakes for a couple
of days. Stitches come out in five.

19:15.532 --> 19:17.909
- When can I get this pierced?
- Are you gonna put that think back in?

19:17.944 --> 19:20.937
- Screw them. I won't let those losers win.
- Good for you.

19:20.953 --> 19:21.984
I'll see you next time, then.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.699
- Got ahold of Plastics?
- Nice job, huh?

19:24.914 --> 19:28.496
- Did you even call them?
- They tried to recruit me.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.829
I need two milligrams
of morphine for Mrs. Braga.

19:32.003 --> 19:33.663
- Braga?
- Your LOL.

19:33.838 --> 19:35.036
Oh, yeah. Sure.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.422
- Don't you want to see her?
- I trust you.

19:38.634 --> 19:40.839
- That roach coach out there?
- Yeah.

19:41.052 --> 19:43.674
I sent up peritoneal fluid.

19:43.847 --> 19:45.922
Patient name: Stehly. S-T-E-H-L-Y.

19:46.140 --> 19:49.425
Medical record number 452986.

19:51.812 --> 19:53.436
Okay, thank you.

19:53.647 --> 19:55.105
- Hi.
- How are you?

19:55.856 --> 19:57.683
- How are you?
- I'm famished.

19:57.857 --> 20:01.061
I was in the area,
so I stopped by for lunch.

20:01.278 --> 20:03.234
In the neighborhood?

20:03.530 --> 20:06.944
Yeah. I had a meeting
in the Hancock Building.

20:08.784 --> 20:12.282
- So can you slip away?
- I don't know.

20:12.870 --> 20:15.491
Whose rig is that?
Yo, Betsy, whose rig?

20:15.705 --> 20:16.737
What are you screaming about?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.539
Where are the paramedics of that rig?

20:18.708 --> 20:20.451
I don't know. Cafeteria?

20:20.668 --> 20:21.699
What's up?

20:21.877 --> 20:23.999
Call 911! Construction accident!

20:24.212 --> 20:26.288
Well, hang on a second! Hold on!

20:26.506 --> 20:28.000
- You're busy.
- Tonight?

20:28.216 --> 20:29.709
Tonight's a given.

20:32.219 --> 20:34.212
- What's up?
- His friend's trapped.

20:34.388 --> 20:37.388
- What happened?
- We can't get him out.

20:37.556 --> 20:39.217
- He ran here.
- A block away.

20:39.392 --> 20:42.061
- Is he conscious, breathing?
- I don't know!

20:42.228 --> 20:44.469
- Are you coming?
- Hold on.

20:47.645 --> 20:49.934
We have a construction accident...

20:50.106 --> 20:51.980
on the 1200 block of Clybourn.

20:52.192 --> 20:57.103
- We need you there code three.
- Come on, man. We don't have time.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.232
Docs responding.

20:59.574 --> 21:03.026
- If he's breathing, don't touch him.
- Yes, Mom.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.908
- Right there!
- How'd it happen?

21:09.084 --> 21:13.793
The choker must have slipped.
It swung right into him!

21:14.006 --> 21:15.880
Be careful!
Don't burn him!

21:16.092 --> 21:18.926
- I almost got it!
- Anybody call 911?

21:19.094 --> 21:22.630
- Ain't you the 911 guy?
- You get the real deal.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.303
Go and make sure Gordy called!
Go now!

21:25.518 --> 21:28.435
Sir?
Sir, can you tell me your name?

21:28.645 --> 21:32.015
- Joe. Joe Sanders.
- Mr. Sanders!

21:32.033 --> 21:35.816
Carotid pulse weak and thready.
Mr. Sanders!

21:36.028 --> 21:38.946
- His leg is crushed.
- His chest isn't moving.

21:39.115 --> 21:41.025
- Tube him.
- We gotta get in.

21:41.325 --> 21:43.614
- You can reach him?
- Yeah, but I can't see what I'm doing.

21:43.953 --> 21:46.031
We gotta do it.

21:46.066 --> 21:47.407
You ever done a blind intervention before?

21:47.624 --> 21:50.197
- No, but we gotta do it.
- I'll do it.

21:50.418 --> 21:52.624
- Come on.
- It's not a teaching case.

21:52.837 --> 21:55.328
- Be my eyes.
- I'll talk you through it.

21:55.716 --> 21:59.166
- Watch it! Something's loose!
- All right, where am I?

21:59.468 --> 22:01.508
Move to the left. No, wrong way.

22:01.721 --> 22:05.054
- My left or your left?
- My left, your right.

22:05.266 --> 22:06.430
Okay.

22:06.976 --> 22:10.676
That's his cheek. You gotta move over.
That's his ear.

22:11.607 --> 22:15.105
Move up. There you go.
Open it. Bingo!

22:15.317 --> 22:17.524
- You got it?
- Hold on.

22:17.737 --> 22:21.273
- Have you done this before?
- Once. On a cadaver.

22:22.326 --> 22:26.573
All right. There's the epiglottis.
I'm in the vallecula.

22:27.205 --> 22:30.990
- All right.
- Put it down the right pipe.

22:32.711 --> 22:35.998
I hear the EMS boys.
Too little, too late.

22:37.716 --> 22:38.747
I'm in!

22:47.393 --> 22:51.260
Amy, you need to keep
that mask on, okay?

22:51.480 --> 22:52.855
Amy.

22:56.194 --> 22:58.067
I can't breathe.

22:59.529 --> 23:02.780
My name is Dr. Greene.
You're in the hospital.

23:03.075 --> 23:06.491
Your father brought you here.
Okay?

23:07.580 --> 23:11.364
I need you to keep
that mask on, okay?

23:11.793 --> 23:13.121
Help me.

23:18.674 --> 23:23.751
Amy, I can give you some morphine
to make you more comfortable.

23:24.387 --> 23:25.420
Not today.

23:26.099 --> 23:27.130
What?

23:28.392 --> 23:30.883
I don't want to die today.

23:37.402 --> 23:42.693
Do you want me to put you
on a ventilator to help you breathe?

23:45.910 --> 23:49.778
There's a good chance
you'll never come off of it.

23:52.001 --> 23:56.459
I don't want to die.

24:00.675 --> 24:01.707
Lydia.

24:03.595 --> 24:07.890
I need rapid induction.
15 milligrams etomidate.

24:08.099 --> 24:11.968
-100 of sux.
- You're gonna intubate? She's a DNR.

24:12.979 --> 24:17.273
Not anymore. Let's go.

24:19.412 --> 24:22.366
She was on a vent
for two weeks in that ICU.

24:22.401 --> 24:25.581
She needed over eight units of blood!
She's had enough!

24:25.754 --> 24:29.177
Listen, this is what she wanted.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.333
She signed a DNR!

24:30.511 --> 24:31.675
Coming through!

24:31.848 --> 24:34.848
Altered mental status.
Crush injury to the leg.

24:35.059 --> 24:36.554
Why'd she tell you?

24:36.771 --> 24:38.313
Where's Dr. Benton?

24:38.523 --> 24:40.730
Why didn't you use a Sager splint?

24:40.943 --> 24:43.898
He was hypotensive.
We needed to get him here.

24:44.114 --> 24:46.273
- You were there?
- We intubated him.

24:46.617 --> 24:48.778
- He wasn't breathing.
- One, two, three.

24:49.414 --> 24:50.612
What do we got?

24:50.789 --> 24:52.783
Crane operator plowed into him.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.249
Multiple trauma. Crushed femur.

24:55.463 --> 24:58.087
- Why wasn't he put in traction?
- He was crashing. Waste of time.

24:58.301 --> 24:59.843
- You got it from here, Peter?
- Yeah, go.

25:00.052 --> 25:04.302
I'm her father. How many times
do I need to tell you this?

25:04.518 --> 25:06.725
She doesn't want this.
We decided.

25:06.938 --> 25:09.394
Excuse me. I'm chief of emergency.

25:09.566 --> 25:10.597
I've got it, Kerry.

25:10.817 --> 25:13.358
- You his supervisor?
- What's the problem?

25:13.573 --> 25:18.319
My daughter is dying of cancer.
She has a "do not resuscitate" order.

25:18.495 --> 25:19.741
And when I left the room...

25:19.742 --> 25:20.988
he put her on a ventilator...

25:21.166 --> 25:22.282
and now he won't take her off.

25:22.502 --> 25:24.910
- She asked me to.
- She wouldn't do that!

25:25.839 --> 25:27.998
- You have the papers with you?
- I'll get them.

25:29.011 --> 25:34.256
You should. Now that your daughter's
intubated, it gets a little complicated.

25:34.602 --> 25:35.764
What do you mean?

25:35.978 --> 25:39.396
We shouldn't extubate her
until she's breathing on her own.

25:43.156 --> 25:44.614
BP's 90/60! Pulse, 110!

25:44.782 --> 25:46.859
He's bleeding. Let's go!

25:47.077 --> 25:49.486
- Let the doctor take it.
- I am a doctor.

25:49.706 --> 25:53.457
- Who thinks he's a paramedic.
- Dave Malucci, new second year Resident.

25:53.962 --> 25:56.086
- Good breath sounds.
- DPL let's go.

25:56.299 --> 25:58.127
Hold on, Dr. Dave!

25:58.344 --> 26:00.800
Let's get a trauma panel.
Lateral C-spine, chest and pelvis.

26:00.972 --> 26:02.004
Left femur. Let's go.

26:02.223 --> 26:04.632
- Who is this guy?
- Surgical trauma fellow. Call him doctor.

26:04.852 --> 26:08.010
Let's get four units, let's get
a pressure dressing on it.

26:08.045 --> 26:09.692
Put him in traction. And set me up for DPL.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.081
- Didn't I just said that.
- All right, get out of here!

26:12.343 --> 26:15.214
- I said out
- What did I do? Wait. I don't understand.

26:15.430 --> 26:18.005
It that... come on, I'm not leaving.
This is our patient.

26:18.226 --> 26:20.598
You wanna be the hero in the field,
you got to drop them off at the door!

26:20.812 --> 26:22.555
- Shut up!
- Carter. Now!

26:26.277 --> 26:27.978
Ok. Let's get a new kit.

26:28.013 --> 26:30.656
- You okay, Carol?
- Yeah. Fine.

26:31.366 --> 26:33.442
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

26:34.829 --> 26:37.072
I can't believe you did this.

26:40.043 --> 26:42.666
- Mark, what are you doing?
- It's not your problem.

26:42.839 --> 26:45.413
Yes, it is my problem.
I'm head of the department.

26:45.592 --> 26:47.501
By title, remember? You said that yourself.

26:47.677 --> 26:51.012
Don't ever steal my gear again!

26:51.182 --> 26:52.214
He wasn't breathing!

26:52.434 --> 26:54.890
- Did they teach you the importance of-?
- Relax!

26:55.104 --> 26:58.437
We couldn't find you
and it was down the street.

26:58.649 --> 27:01.402
What if we were called to another site
and we didn't have our equipment.

27:01.470 --> 27:03.096
Why don't you go in there
and rip it out of her throat?

27:03.131 --> 27:06.237
Let's break it up.
This isn't the right time or place.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.194
- Wanna take it outside?
- Oh yeah, I'll take outside.

27:08.411 --> 27:11.399
Oh, come on. Nobody's taking anything
anywhere. Go back to work.

27:11.615 --> 27:15.793
- Why? I got doctors to do it for me.
- Go back to work. Get out of here.

27:21.118 --> 27:24.004
You two, hold on!
Hold on! Get back here!

27:24.806 --> 27:25.965
Can we tell you what happened?

27:26.048 --> 27:28.458
I heard what happened.
Do you have a brain between you?

27:28.527 --> 27:31.430
- Dr Weaver, we called them-
- No! No! I talk, you listen!

27:31.648 --> 27:34.020
You work in this hospital,
not in the street.

27:34.234 --> 27:37.319
You are not trained for it.
You are not covered for it.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.848
And you have patients here
who need your attention.

27:39.883 --> 27:40.854
One of them might have coded.

27:41.076 --> 27:44.944
Or we might have been hit with other traumas
while you where out playing paramedics.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.444
Were you?

27:46.666 --> 27:49.434
Don't even start, Dr. Malucci.

27:49.469 --> 27:52.281
I'm only cutting this much slack
because you're new here.

27:52.316 --> 27:54.348
And you Carter, you should know better.

27:54.383 --> 27:58.797
You're emergency Residents,
not paramedics. Is that understood?

27:59.272 --> 28:01.561
Is it understood?

28:05.773 --> 28:08.892
That was great, Dave. Thanks.
I appreciate that.

28:10.402 --> 28:13.855
We document all consents
in the chart.

28:14.158 --> 28:15.189
Is there a problem?

28:15.268 --> 28:17.407
You didn't tell me
you tested the baby for HIV.

28:17.619 --> 28:20.111
- I told you he was positive.
- I thought you were assuming.

28:20.289 --> 28:22.996
I didn't know you tested him without
the mother's consent.

28:23.628 --> 28:26.830
The mother was comatose. We had
to get him started in the antiviral drugs.

28:27.047 --> 28:28.328
Who authorized it?

28:28.549 --> 28:32.964
I did. I was looking out for the baby.
We gained 10 days of treatment.

28:33.139 --> 28:34.846
You broke the law.

28:36.016 --> 28:38.244
Will this affect your decision
about foster care?

28:38.279 --> 28:40.146
- I'll have to explain this.
- Will it?

28:40.481 --> 28:43.232
No. You obviously care about the child.

28:43.609 --> 28:44.724
But?

28:47.406 --> 28:50.158
- It's not gonna work.
- Why not?

28:50.410 --> 28:54.907
The director won't approve.
I'm sorry, Jeanie. I said I'd look into it.

28:55.457 --> 28:56.489
I did.

29:00.963 --> 29:02.624
Is it because I'm black?

29:04.677 --> 29:07.844
- What?
- I'm black. The baby's Hispanic.

29:09.516 --> 29:11.972
- What do you take me for?
- I'm not really sure.

29:12.186 --> 29:14.938
Because you'd rather
put him in a facility.

29:15.106 --> 29:20.018
- You're not qualified. It's simple.
- Is it because of my HIV status?

29:21.322 --> 29:22.864
It doesn't help.

29:23.324 --> 29:26.991
Look, I'm healthy. There's no reason to
think that I won't continue to be healthy.

29:27.205 --> 29:29.363
What about when the child is 5?
When he's 10?

29:29.540 --> 29:30.703
Can you say that then?

29:30.917 --> 29:32.245
Can anyone say that?

29:32.418 --> 29:34.875
Look, I don't know how to tell you no
any other way.

29:35.298 --> 29:38.115
I know his needs. I'd be better-

29:38.184 --> 29:39.795
It's no, Miss Boulet.

29:40.970 --> 29:42.716
The answer is no.

29:43.307 --> 29:46.842
Lavage is negative.
Lost a few liters from the popliteal artery.

29:47.061 --> 29:48.426
What's the tibia look like?

29:48.461 --> 29:51.560
Fracture in 20 pieces. It's a mess.

29:51.776 --> 29:54.693
- Where are you going?
- Shirley cleared O.R. 1.

29:54.904 --> 29:57.858
Thanks for buffing him up, Peter.
But Lizzie can take it from here.

29:58.074 --> 29:59.268
Yes, but he's a trauma patient.

29:59.337 --> 30:02.403
Indeed he is and this trauma fellowship
of yours is through the ER, correct?

30:02.581 --> 30:04.952
- Yeah? So?
- So that's an O.R. That's for surgeons.

30:05.124 --> 30:07.747
Yeah but I've been operating the last
three weeks as a trauma fellow.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.207
Yes I know. But now as chieff of staff
I have to be concerned with credentials.

30:12.842 --> 30:14.502
You chose this. Not me.

30:14.719 --> 30:15.887
Elizabeth, I leave up to you.

30:15.922 --> 30:18.548
Under no circumstances is that man
to go into that operating room.

30:18.767 --> 30:21.009
Call security if you have to
and enjoy your first solo surgery.

30:21.619 --> 30:22.549
Solo?

30:22.628 --> 30:25.614
Yes, an associate chief
can operate by herself.

30:25.789 --> 30:27.366
Dr. Benton.

30:28.748 --> 30:29.779
Peter?

30:38.836 --> 30:41.504
Hey, you okay?

30:41.670 --> 30:43.543
This case.

30:43.655 --> 30:45.331
Dying girl.

30:45.613 --> 30:49.128
Dad's called a lawyer. Weaver-

30:49.548 --> 30:51.090
Forget it.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.633
Mark, maybe you should
take a few days off.

30:54.742 --> 30:56.549
I just had a week off.

30:56.660 --> 31:01.218
That wasn't a vacation, Mark.
Losing a parent is stressful.

31:01.479 --> 31:03.275
I gotta get back to work.

31:08.159 --> 31:10.366
Why isn't he here?

31:11.121 --> 31:12.616
Vanessa?

31:13.417 --> 31:14.958
I'm sorry?

31:15.335 --> 31:16.912
Is who coming?

31:17.128 --> 31:19.335
- The priest?
- Why isn't he here?

31:20.841 --> 31:24.341
- No. You told me not to.
- I don't want to go alone.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.006
Okay. Okay. He'll be here.

31:27.224 --> 31:31.971
Jeanie, I didn't know you were
considering becoming a foster parent.

31:32.189 --> 31:35.688
Robert Martin called me
asking for a referral.

31:35.859 --> 31:37.770
Yeah. Unfortunately it's not gonna work out.

31:37.946 --> 31:39.025
Why not?

31:39.198 --> 31:43.029
I didn't get a clear answer. I guess
too many things stacked against me.

31:43.243 --> 31:45.914
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. Thanks, Kerry.

31:46.122 --> 31:48.696
Some things aren't meant to be.
See you tomorrow.

31:49.752 --> 31:52.831
Next time wait till they stop
swinging at the piñata...

31:52.918 --> 31:54.875
before you dive for the candy.

31:55.092 --> 31:57.085
Excuse me. Mark.

31:57.553 --> 32:00.589
Mr. Stehly's making a lot of noise.

32:00.806 --> 32:03.761
I need a detailed record
about his daughter.

32:03.977 --> 32:06.516
Your new charting system should help.

32:06.897 --> 32:10.433
This is serious, Mark.
You know the position we're in?

32:10.652 --> 32:14.235
I followed my patient's wishes.
She's over 18.

32:14.615 --> 32:18.066
She signed a DNR and gave
her father power of attorney.

32:18.243 --> 32:20.700
- She has rights.
- She's throwing PVCs.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.071
- How many?
- 10 to 12.

32:22.291 --> 32:23.306
Give her lidocaine?

32:23.384 --> 32:26.254
Not yet. I wanted to make sure.
So she's no longer DNR?

32:26.963 --> 32:29.208
- If she codes?
- Resuscitate her.

32:29.243 --> 32:31.387
- No, don't!
- Kerry, she's my patient!

32:31.422 --> 32:33.751
You can't ignore a standing DNR!

32:34.013 --> 32:35.508
- She revoked it!
- She can't!

32:35.724 --> 32:37.598
Not with altered mental status!

32:37.768 --> 32:40.757
Did you see her CT?
That girl has mets all over her brain.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.730
She's on morphine. Probably hypopsic.

32:42.765 --> 32:45.858
I talked to her.
She was conscious and alert.

32:46.111 --> 32:48.863
- I didn't see that.
- You have to trust me.

32:51.702 --> 32:54.572
I'm not sure you're being objective.

32:54.830 --> 32:57.072
- Kerry...
- I should take over.

32:57.291 --> 32:59.998
- I've got it covered.
- Mark, I'm taking this patient.

33:00.796 --> 33:02.254
You're gonna have to fire me first.

33:03.632 --> 33:06.206
So, what do I do if she codes?

33:06.427 --> 33:09.383
Nothing, Carter. You do nothing.

33:12.409 --> 33:15.179
If she codes, call me, Carter.

33:18.443 --> 33:21.645
Randy, are you sure this list is right?
I paged Father Erps twice.

33:21.821 --> 33:25.322
Oh, I think he's on sabbatical in Brasil.
There's a junior Jesuit substituting for him.

33:25.534 --> 33:27.741
- Where's his number?
- I don't know. It's around here somewhere.

33:27.954 --> 33:31.572
Find it! Randy. She doesn't have much time.
Lucy, where's Malucci?

33:31.791 --> 33:33.666
- Think him first as Dr. Dave.
- Whatever, where is he?

33:33.836 --> 33:37.669
I don't know. Try the Coast Guard.
Maybe he's out doing search and rescue.

33:37.923 --> 33:38.955
What's wrong?

33:39.133 --> 33:41.708
This woman's BP is down to 60 palp.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.631
Her kidneys have shut down.

33:43.848 --> 33:45.841
- I got it.
- Really? Thank you.

33:46.059 --> 33:48.181
- Carol, have you seen Mark?
- He was here.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.353
- Is he still on?
- I think so.

33:50.564 --> 33:53.732
Elizabeth.
I hear you laid up today in the O.R.

33:54.069 --> 33:58.363
- "Laid up"?
- Golf term. You played it safe.

33:58.657 --> 33:59.589
That's not a criticism.

33:59.667 --> 34:02.359
We all get more conservative
when we are in the driver seat.

34:02.787 --> 34:05.872
- Welcome to the big leagues.
- Listen, Robert, about Peter-

34:06.083 --> 34:08.705
Peter.
Aren't you tired of that subject?

34:08.878 --> 34:12.202
He acepted this fellowship in the asumption
he'd would be operating on his trauma patients

34:12.237 --> 34:13.177
He's board eligible-

34:13.212 --> 34:17.165
- I know, I'm just messing with him.
- So you'll let him operate?

34:18.047 --> 34:19.839
For you, Lizzie, anything.

34:19.975 --> 34:23.188
Only on trauma. Not elective cases.
And not general surgery.

34:23.223 --> 34:24.043
Naturally.

34:24.063 --> 34:27.230
- And I want you to police him.
- Fine.

34:27.400 --> 34:31.150
So, is that an official acceptance
of my offer?

34:31.447 --> 34:34.567
- I suppose it is.
- Wise choice. See you tomorrow.

34:34.742 --> 34:37.275
Here's a termination list.

34:37.310 --> 34:39.181
We need to cut some dead weight.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.406
It'll sound better coming from you.

34:43.619 --> 34:46.172
- Dr. Corday.
- Carter, have you seen Mark?

34:46.382 --> 34:47.960
He's around here some place.

34:48.134 --> 34:51.088
I think you saw a patient of mine
in radiology today. Nichols?

34:51.304 --> 34:53.983
- Your patient?
- Yeah. Came in last week.

34:54.056 --> 34:57.818
Fender bender. Had some
minor cervical tenderness.

34:57.853 --> 34:58.868
Did I miss something?

34:59.230 --> 35:03.016
No, it's nothing to do with an accident.
She came for a second opinion.

35:03.445 --> 35:06.031
On- On what?

35:06.340 --> 35:08.196
Infiltrating duct cell carcinoma.

35:10.661 --> 35:12.456
Breast cancer.

35:12.530 --> 35:14.454
So she's looking at surgery?

35:14.625 --> 35:17.661
Has to have a mastectomy, I'm afraid.

35:17.877 --> 35:20.168
Carter! This girl's in V-tach!

35:20.381 --> 35:22.173
- Trauma 1!
- Need some help?

35:22.342 --> 35:24.300
No. No, I got it.

35:24.929 --> 35:26.802
- She have a pulse?
- A weak one.

35:26.972 --> 35:30.425
- What's her BP?
-60 palp. Paddles are ready.

35:31.937 --> 35:33.479
Dr. Carter?

35:33.814 --> 35:36.851
Get Dr. Greene.
Let's open up the pads.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.607
- No need. She's a DNR.
- Dr. Weaver-

35:39.863 --> 35:43.528
I understand that you're
in an awkward position.

35:43.826 --> 35:47.196
- You're gonna let her arrest?
- I'll take it from here.

35:47.706 --> 35:52.203
- How about a chemical code?
- This woman is not to be resuscitated.

35:52.962 --> 35:54.955
Just an amp of lidocaine.

35:55.132 --> 35:57.670
She has no chance of a recovery.

35:57.885 --> 36:02.512
She wanted this. Her family wants it.
Don't touch her.

36:17.326 --> 36:20.777
- I know.
- But I want to believe.

36:20.954 --> 36:22.386
Now you can.

36:24.835 --> 36:26.875
He forgives me?

36:27.254 --> 36:29.211
He forgives you.

36:31.926 --> 36:34.549
Can you bless me, Father?

37:10.515 --> 37:12.009
Where is she?

37:12.225 --> 37:13.255
V- fib.

37:13.434 --> 37:15.977
Damn you, Kerry. Carter, start CPR!

37:17.231 --> 37:19.323
Charge to 200.

37:20.777 --> 37:23.751
Haleh, charge to 200 now.

37:27.660 --> 37:29.786
Kerry, you're chief.
You need to make a decision.

37:29.863 --> 37:31.955
We do this, or I go.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.049
- Ready.
- Clear!

37:55.653 --> 37:56.982
Clear!

37:58.280 --> 37:59.823
-300.
- Charging.

38:00.032 --> 38:01.824
How far are you gonna go?

38:02.076 --> 38:04.486
She wanted a ventilator. Not this.

38:04.789 --> 38:05.952
Clear!

38:09.502 --> 38:10.533
Clear!

38:16.177 --> 38:17.292
Still in V-fib.

38:17.470 --> 38:19.879
One more time. 360. 100 of lidocaine.

38:20.099 --> 38:23.516
Did she say she wanted you pounding
on her chest, shocking her heart?

38:23.687 --> 38:26.438
Shut up, Kerry!
Or get out of here!

38:29.610 --> 38:30.891
Clear!

38:47.507 --> 38:48.538
Asystole.

38:55.642 --> 38:57.385
You want atropine?

38:59.396 --> 39:01.223
You want atropine?

39:02.150 --> 39:03.893
No. It's over.

39:06.864 --> 39:10.198
Time of death, 20:34.

39:25.971 --> 39:27.714
Mark, I-

39:38.026 --> 39:39.307
- Hey there.
- Hi.

39:39.528 --> 39:43.942
- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk. I've been thinking-

39:44.159 --> 39:47.362
No, listen.
That day when you proposed to me...

39:47.579 --> 39:49.121
...most of me wanted to scream "Yes!"

39:49.289 --> 39:51.960
and run to the courthouse
and do it right then.

39:52.169 --> 39:55.419
- Most of you?
- But the rest of me was scared.

39:55.630 --> 39:58.236
I knew that I loved you.

39:58.535 --> 40:01.720
I've just been with this little baby
who needed a mother.

40:01.931 --> 40:04.255
I knew instantly that I wanted
to be that mother.

40:07.479 --> 40:09.886
I didn't want to say yes
for the wrong reason.

40:11.191 --> 40:13.033
I see.

40:13.861 --> 40:16.373
They told me that I can't have him.

40:16.408 --> 40:17.354
Baby, I'm sorry.

40:17.574 --> 40:22.736
It's okay. It's okay, because I know
that I really do want to marry you.

40:23.123 --> 40:24.997
I know that now.

40:27.253 --> 40:30.705
- Do you still want to marry me?
- Yes.

40:31.591 --> 40:33.403
Isn't it a sin to fake a sacrament?

40:33.484 --> 40:36.219
It was a blessing.
Anyone can give a blessing.

40:36.430 --> 40:38.024
Not posing as a priest.

40:38.140 --> 40:41.345
It was her faith.
That's what's important.

40:41.561 --> 40:45.013
- So how did you know what to say?
- I faked it.

40:46.192 --> 40:49.478
I know a little bit of Latin,
a little bit of Croatian.

40:49.696 --> 40:51.357
You faked it well.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.445
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

40:58.665 --> 41:02.533
It's just they're active,
moving around down there.

41:03.547 --> 41:04.957
May I?

41:49.768 --> 41:51.393
What?

42:01.033 --> 42:02.064
You know.

42:04.996 --> 42:06.788
Don't you?

42:10.794 --> 42:12.123
Yes.

42:43.334 --> 42:45.373
You should just leave now.

42:47.380 --> 42:48.811
Elaine.

43:00.355 --> 43:03.142
Peter. Peter!

43:03.942 --> 43:06.434
Did you hire a private investigator?

43:06.946 --> 43:08.322
What?

43:10.324 --> 43:13.082
Some guy talked to Dafina...

43:13.117 --> 43:15.010
and asked her if I've ever done drugs.

43:15.039 --> 43:17.375
Oh Carla, look, the only person I hired
was my lawyer.

43:17.410 --> 43:19.618
Well, did he get this guy to start
asking questions about me?

43:19.836 --> 43:21.034
No!

43:22.756 --> 43:26.969
- I don't know.
- Why are you doing this?

43:27.179 --> 43:29.848
- Why am I doing this?
- Restraining orders and lawyers-

43:30.307 --> 43:33.392
Carla, I only have one son.
Roger can get another job.

43:33.853 --> 43:36.035
This is a great opportunity for us, Peter!

43:36.039 --> 43:37.470
What about Reece?

43:37.532 --> 43:39.810
You ever think about that? I mean,
you want to take him away from his father?

43:40.069 --> 43:42.458
You may not even be his father!

43:44.775 --> 43:46.072
What?

43:46.075 --> 43:49.576
He might not be yours. There was
somebody else. It was just casual.

43:49.789 --> 43:51.866
And then there was you.

43:53.355 --> 43:56.931
I did it for Reece!
He needed a father! Roger can be-

43:57.006 --> 43:59.545
Look, Reece is my son, Carla!

44:07.936 --> 44:10.161
Reece is my son.
