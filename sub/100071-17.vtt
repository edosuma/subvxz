Come on, Maggie.

00:09.109 --> 00:12.012
(panting)
Hi. Sorry we're late.

00:12.079 --> 00:14.715
This is Maggie.
We're here for our first day.

00:14.781 --> 00:18.185
Hello, Maggie.
And who will be picking her up?

00:18.252 --> 00:21.054
W‐‐ A‐After she falls down?

00:21.121 --> 00:23.056
No, at the end of the day.

00:23.123 --> 00:24.925
Wait, I don't stay with her?

00:24.992 --> 00:27.294
Research shows
pre‐toddlers learn best

00:29.296 --> 00:32.065
Unless you <i>want</i> to stunt
her growth, which is great.

00:32.132 --> 00:34.234
(quietly):
We're not supposed to judge.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.236
No, no, it's not that.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.739
I just don't want Maggie
to feel abandoned.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.575
(giggling)

00:41.642 --> 00:43.577
So, we'll see you at 4:00.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.079
Oh. Okay, then.

00:46.146 --> 00:50.150
Hmm. Now what will I do
with the rest of my day?

00:50.217 --> 00:53.420
I know.
I'll ask my favorite mommy blog.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.156
Hmm. Hmm.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.425
Now turn that resistance
all the way up!

00:58.492 --> 01:02.062
Come on! I want to see
you bitches suffer!

01:02.129 --> 01:04.097
(cheering)

01:04.164 --> 01:05.933
(quietly): Am I the only one
who heard that?

01:05.999 --> 01:07.267
I love it.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.937
It's like being coached
by the voice inside my head.

01:10.003 --> 01:13.574
Spin yourselves to death,
you land manatees!

(groans) Mm.

01:18.845 --> 01:20.013

01:20.080 --> 01:24.017
Paint harder,

01:26.186 --> 01:29.089
"Sex‐prise

Mm... Hmm?

01:30.257 --> 01:31.792
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

01:31.858 --> 01:36.430
Maybe you could give <i>me</i>
a safety inspection.

01:36.496 --> 01:39.032
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.301
I'm so sex‐prised!

01:41.368 --> 01:44.037
(quietly): There's security
cameras everywhere,

01:44.104 --> 01:46.807

Oh!

01:50.210 --> 01:53.246
Thanks, Jerry!
Nice. Real cool.

01:53.313 --> 01:57.384
(sighs)
<i>Now</i> how do I fill the day? Hmm.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.052
What's Well Plus Good?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.420
It's pronounced "Well and Good."

02:00.487 --> 02:03.190
Ugh, why is everyone
talking to me?

02:03.256 --> 02:05.192
Well, if all these people
want to work here,

02:05.258 --> 02:07.260
maybe <i>I</i> want to work here.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.931
All right, go to tablet seven

02:10.998 --> 02:13.600
to take your pre‐application
ethics assessment.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.035
Cool hair, by the way.

02:15.102 --> 02:18.105
<i>You</i> think that my hair is coo?

02:18.171 --> 02:20.874
(chuckles)
Well, thank you, Lauren.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.877
Oh, by the way,
your name tag is upside down.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.445
Mm, thank you.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.681
You're the only person
to mention that.

02:34.755 --> 02:39.226
Ooh, major mom vibes.
She's perfect.

"I always never lie."

02:42.295 --> 02:46.099
Hmm. Two.
"I <i>sometimes</i> always never lie."

02:46.166 --> 02:49.870
"If I never found a wallet,
I would always give it back."

02:49.936 --> 02:52.105
What color is the wallet?

02:52.172 --> 02:55.075
Marge Simpson.
There was never a test.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.044
Except there always was.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.880
‐There wasn't?
‐And you passed.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.315
Welcome to
the Well and Good family.

03:02.382 --> 03:05.152

Your résumés will be deleted.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.387

03:07.454 --> 03:09.856
I'm the only one you hired?

03:09.923 --> 03:12.726
You're the only one
we partnered with.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.960
Hmm.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.731
Okay, so I work here now.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.700
I never asked what we sell.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.068
I can figure this out.

03:21.134 --> 03:25.706
Hmm. Candy? Bath bombs?
Blowtorches?

03:25.772 --> 03:28.108
$30 bottles of soda?

03:28.175 --> 03:29.376
Uh, excuse me.

03:29.443 --> 03:32.212
Uh, do you recommend
the tincture or the oil?

03:32.279 --> 03:35.549
I‐‐ The‐the tincture
is more expensive, I guess.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.718
Look, this is about <i>you.</i>

03:37.784 --> 03:40.587
And taking care of you.
I think.

03:40.654 --> 03:44.224
So you have
to put yourself... first?

03:44.291 --> 03:47.060
Well, your no‐frills,
fumbling sales pitch

03:47.127 --> 03:50.030
has won me over.
I'll take both. Yes...

03:50.097 --> 03:53.266
Wow, girl, you just made
a hundred‐dollar sale.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.102
You're gonna fit in great here.

03:55.168 --> 03:58.305
Thing is, what does <i>here</i> sell?

03:58.371 --> 04:00.307
Is this what RadioShack is now?

04:00.373 --> 04:03.076
Mm, no. We're a high‐end
cannabis boutique.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.145
You sell pot?!

04:05.212 --> 04:06.646
Technically, I check I. D. s.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.215
<i>You</i> sell pot.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.384
(gasps)

04:11.451 --> 04:13.153
I'm a drugs dealer!

04:13.220 --> 04:15.922
Mm, cannabis is legal
in this state now.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.657
Well, so is water‐skiing,

04:17.724 --> 04:19.826
but that doesn't mean
I have to sell it!

04:19.893 --> 04:21.661
I'm sorry.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.064
Marge, don't leave, seriously.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.599
Like, I'm asking.

04:25.665 --> 04:30.070
Drederick Tatum! (gasps)
I own your countertop grill.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.005
Oh, take care not to use
metal utensils

04:32.072 --> 04:33.440
on the non‐stick surfaces.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.109
But anyway, after
my boxing career ended,

04:36.176 --> 04:37.444
I was in a lot of pain.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.179
Specifically,
in my punching hands

04:39.246 --> 04:40.614
and my blocking face.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.183
But following a regimen
of CBD oil

04:43.250 --> 04:45.685
and medicinal hits
from a Pikachu bong,

04:45.752 --> 04:47.954
I was able to enjoy life again.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.224
Which inspired me to create
Well and Good Healing Emporiums.

04:51.291 --> 04:55.195
But pot is for Cheeches...
and Chongs.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.630
Marge, it's not about
getting high.

04:56.696 --> 04:58.031
It's about wellness.

04:58.098 --> 05:01.001
And that's why I've hand‐picked
the perfect team here.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.402
I'm an expert in cannabinoids

05:02.469 --> 05:04.404
and cutting‐edge
delivery systems,

05:04.471 --> 05:07.007
aka infusers, decarboxylators,

05:07.073 --> 05:09.309
transdermals
and pet suppositories.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.244
And I'm super hot.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.979
And what do you need <i>me</i> for?

05:13.046 --> 05:14.648
Marge, people know
you want to help them,

05:14.714 --> 05:16.049
that it's safe here.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.051
Not some place
for Cheeches and Chongs,

05:18.118 --> 05:19.486
as you so recently put it.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.856
Uh, I'm sorry.
I don't think this is really me.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.492
‐Good luck with your lifestyle.
‐Uh...

05:25.559 --> 05:28.895
Oh, it's a shame there's no drug
for hurt feelings.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.964
Oh, wait, there totally is.

05:32.465 --> 05:36.069
(all munching)

05:36.136 --> 05:38.705
You know, in some families,

05:38.772 --> 05:40.841
they go around the table
and everyone says

05:40.907 --> 05:42.876
one thing they learned that day.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.745
Okay. I learned <i>that.</i>

05:45.812 --> 05:48.515
Well, <i>I</i> learned that
the former heavyweight champion

05:48.582 --> 05:51.084
of the world
owns a marijuana store.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.353
And he offered me a job,
which I turned down.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.554
Wait, what?

05:54.621 --> 05:56.890
I mean, the people
were really cool,

05:56.957 --> 05:58.558
and they thought <i>I</i> was cool,

05:58.625 --> 06:00.994
which made me feel "stoked."

06:01.061 --> 06:05.065
(sighs) But I'm not going to be
a reefer saleslady.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.033
Well, I guess there's nothing
wrong with it.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.836
Cannabis is legal in this state.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.504
Yeah, it's basically
the same thing

06:11.571 --> 06:13.006
as working in a liquor store.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.675
You can work in a liquor store?

06:15.742 --> 06:18.078
‐(gasps) Mmm...
‐Stay with us, big guy.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.379
Mm...

06:19.446 --> 06:22.015
Wow. I thought you'd be
opposed to it.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.017
People are stressed out
these days.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.187
Scurvy is back,
there's, like, 60 wars going on.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.757
Whales are eating
our precious ocean plastic.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.360
Maybe people want
to smoke a doob for that.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.096
Oh, yeah, everyone's
selling crap to stoners now.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.598
Have you seen the new
Krusty Burger commercial?

06:38.665 --> 06:41.234
<i>(sitar music playing)</i>

06:41.301 --> 06:44.604

<i>wink, wink‐‐</i>
<i>you crave weird.</i>

06:48.008 --> 06:50.110
<i>A deep‐fried rib‐wich</i>

06:50.176 --> 06:52.012
<i>served on a warm doughnut.</i>

06:52.078 --> 06:54.781
<i>Or a spaghetti‐filled</i>
<i>grilled cheese sandwich</i>

06:54.848 --> 06:57.117
<i>drizzled with ranch pudding.</i>

06:57.183 --> 07:02.022
<i>Krusty's Munchie Mouthfuls.</i>
<i>It's high time you tried it.</i>

07:06.026 --> 07:07.027
<i>Get it?</i>

07:07.093 --> 07:09.396
(chuckles)
I get it.

07:09.462 --> 07:13.033
Well, Mr. Tatum
did personally choose me.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.801
He said I was helpful.

07:14.868 --> 07:18.004
Honey, you're the most
helpful person I've ever met.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.907
Now go sell the safe
legal drugs

07:20.974 --> 07:24.177
our kids should never, ever use!

07:24.244 --> 07:25.812
‐Especially Bart!
‐Uh...?

07:30.283 --> 07:32.585
(humming)

07:32.652 --> 07:34.020
Is this an Apple store?

07:34.087 --> 07:36.022
Everyone keeps asking that.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.491
I dropped my phone
because of my arthritis.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.026
We can't fix your phone,

07:40.093 --> 07:42.829
but I can sure help
with that arthritis.

07:42.896 --> 07:46.866
Try this amazing
pain‐relieving lotion.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.002
Oh. It tingles.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.671
Not like Jergens.
I hate Jergens!

07:51.738 --> 07:55.842
You seem stressed. Hmm.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.511
Why not try some yummy gummies?

07:58.578 --> 08:00.046
(laughing)

08:00.113 --> 08:04.117
Marge, thank you.
When Mother's happy, I'm happy.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.019
Or at least,
much less miserable.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.488
This big shot here
is the principal

All right,
pump the brakes, Jhorts.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.143
Got to ask
a few questions first.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.879
Now, do you want a body high

Okay, almost there.
Almost there. Now listen.

Nothing makes sense anymore!

(scoffs) It doesn't make my hair
smell like anything!

09:22.529 --> 09:26.032
(sighs) I dreamed my whole life
of legalized weed.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.134
Turns out it's a real buzzkill.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.569
Ain't that the truth?

09:29.636 --> 09:30.970
Times have changed.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.207
The romance of alcohol
is fading into the past.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.544
Stoners will never know the joy
of sitting on the toilet

09:37.610 --> 09:39.412
and barfing into
your own underwear.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.482
Or picking a fight with a guy
twice your size

09:42.549 --> 09:45.051
because his leg
touched your car.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.053
Yeah. I miss the old days, too.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.890
When buying pot was...
(sniffles) scuzzy.

09:50.957 --> 09:54.160
I'd pay anything
to turn back that clock.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.595
