WEBVTT

00:03.770 --> 00:05.340
Max, we're back!

00:05.408 --> 00:08.741
Oh that sucks. This place didn't
burn down while we were gone

00:08.742 --> 00:11.445
like I had hoped.

00:11.446 --> 00:15.349
The night is young, and I have
a Roman candle in my pocket.

00:15.350 --> 00:17.451
Hi, welcome to the Williamsburg diner.

00:17.452 --> 00:18.585
Table for two?

00:18.586 --> 00:20.220
Don't be silly, Earl.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.755
It's us, Max and Caroline.

00:21.756 --> 00:24.590
And I'm Earl. Smoking or nonsmoking?

00:25.959 --> 00:27.895
Glad to have you back.

00:27.896 --> 00:29.329
Max and Caroline!

00:29.330 --> 00:31.331
You're back from your road trip.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.268
And right on time for yesterday's shift.

00:34.269 --> 00:36.136
We're also not working today.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.470
Tomorrow's not great either.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.341
Ugh, thank God you're back.

00:41.342 --> 00:45.279
Besides Han, there hasn't been
a girl in here in days, and...

00:45.280 --> 00:47.714
she's not my type.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.715
What is your type?

00:48.716 --> 00:50.883
Hepatitis A, B, or C?

00:52.219 --> 00:55.188
So what did you bring us?

00:55.189 --> 00:57.391
Uh, you guys don't understand.

00:57.392 --> 00:59.159
We got kicked off a riverboat,

00:59.160 --> 01:00.661
almost crashed a plane,

01:00.662 --> 01:02.563
and lost everything we own.

01:02.564 --> 01:04.631
Honestly, it's a miracle we're alive.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.966
So... no gifts?

01:12.507 --> 01:18.711
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

01:24.655 --> 01:25.798
Let's get to the dessert bar

01:25.799 --> 01:27.223
so we can see the work they did.

01:27.224 --> 01:28.658
Also so people don't think

01:28.659 --> 01:30.226
we're customers here.

01:30.227 --> 01:31.928
I'm excited to see it too,

01:31.929 --> 01:33.930
and now that Randy
and I are really over,

01:33.931 --> 01:37.167
I promise to give the
dessert bar my full 5%.

01:37.168 --> 01:39.602
Make it 6%.

01:39.603 --> 01:41.437
I mean, what else am I gonna do, hmm?

01:42.672 --> 01:43.772
Stop.

01:45.742 --> 01:47.577
Oleg, stop blocking the door.

01:47.578 --> 01:48.912
We're not on a date with you.

01:48.913 --> 01:50.947
We want to see the dessert bar.

01:50.948 --> 01:51.948
Eh, sure,

01:51.949 --> 01:53.616
but before you go in there,

01:53.617 --> 01:55.151
do you want to see a cute picture

01:55.152 --> 01:57.087
of me, Sophie, and baby Barbara?

01:57.088 --> 01:58.755
Sure.

02:01.624 --> 02:03.625
You didn't say it was in the bathtub.

02:05.362 --> 02:06.996
Well, now that you're annoyed

02:06.997 --> 02:08.431
and hopefully a little impressed...

02:08.431 --> 02:09.431
Mm-mm.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.433
I can tell you

02:10.434 --> 02:11.657
I had to fire your contractor.

02:11.658 --> 02:12.802
What?

02:12.803 --> 02:14.170
I thought I could do a better job.

02:14.171 --> 02:15.471
- What?
- I couldn't.

02:17.374 --> 02:19.109
I can't believe Oleg!

02:19.110 --> 02:21.013
How the hell could he
let a complete stranger...

02:22.780 --> 02:25.048
Do such an amazing job?

02:25.049 --> 02:26.683
Wow.

02:26.684 --> 02:28.585
Wait, we're still killing
Oleg, though, right?

02:28.586 --> 02:30.719
'Cause the wheels are already in motion.

02:32.222 --> 02:33.823
Oh, my God, look at the doors.

02:33.824 --> 02:35.558
And the molding?

02:35.559 --> 02:37.994
And the sconces?

02:37.995 --> 02:39.763
I don't remember what an orgasm is like,

02:39.764 --> 02:41.831
but I think I might be having one.

02:41.832 --> 02:43.166
Hey, girls.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.934
Welcome home.

02:44.935 --> 02:48.638
Baby Barbara thought you were dead.

02:48.639 --> 02:51.007
Isn't that funny?

02:51.008 --> 02:54.176
Not "Vince Vaughn doing
drama" funny, but what is?

02:55.545 --> 02:58.715
Wow, Barbara got so
big while we were gone.

02:58.716 --> 03:01.785
Oh, shh!

03:01.786 --> 03:03.489
You got to give her a
break, 'cause she got

03:03.490 --> 03:06.489
her Uncle Fatso's genes.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.691
By the way, Sophie, thank
you for watching our horse

03:08.692 --> 03:09.793
while we were gone.

03:09.794 --> 03:11.361
He's my favorite roommate.

03:11.362 --> 03:12.629
Aww, well, you know what,

03:12.630 --> 03:14.197
that's what friends are for.

03:14.198 --> 03:16.466
And I'm sure you would
do the same for me

03:16.467 --> 03:18.234
if I needed a favor.

03:18.235 --> 03:20.870
- Of course we would.
- Good, 'cause I need a favor.

03:20.871 --> 03:22.405
Yeah, see,

03:22.406 --> 03:25.408
I joined this mommy
support group, you know,

03:25.409 --> 03:28.311
to make sure that I'm
holding the baby up right,

03:28.312 --> 03:29.979
or you know,

03:29.980 --> 03:31.815
that I don't get too jealous

03:31.816 --> 03:33.916
when people compliment her.

03:35.151 --> 03:37.754
The standard mom stuff.

03:37.755 --> 03:39.255
So what's the favor?

03:39.256 --> 03:41.357
I'll do anything up to a Class B felony.

03:41.358 --> 03:42.759
I still have one strike left.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.161
Well, I'm hosting,

03:45.162 --> 03:47.831
and there are gonna be a
lot of sloppy babies there,

03:47.832 --> 03:51.768
so I'm looking for a real dump.

03:51.769 --> 03:54.571
Can I use your place?

03:54.572 --> 03:56.272
- Aww.
- Sophie, I don't think...

03:56.273 --> 03:58.408
Thank you, girls.

03:58.409 --> 03:59.943
Yeah, you're the best,

03:59.944 --> 04:03.545
no matter what baby
Barbara tells her friends.

04:06.182 --> 04:08.585
I thought Barbara liked me.

04:08.586 --> 04:10.285
I'm gonna text her.

04:13.590 --> 04:15.024
Oh, hey. I'm Bobby.

04:15.025 --> 04:16.392
I did the work on your bar.

04:16.392 --> 04:18.962
You must be Max and Caroline.

04:18.963 --> 04:22.130
I'm Maroline, and this is Cax.

04:23.601 --> 04:25.344
- I mean...
- Yeah, let's just move past it.

04:25.345 --> 04:27.136
Uh, we're who you said.

04:27.137 --> 04:28.404
Well, I hope you like it.

04:28.405 --> 04:29.405
The only guidance I got

04:29.406 --> 04:30.540
was from your friend Oleg,

04:30.541 --> 04:32.442
who just kept saying "sluttier."

04:32.443 --> 04:35.110
And then he showed me a
picture of him in the bathtub.

04:36.646 --> 04:38.982
You did an amazing job.

04:38.983 --> 04:40.917
I mean, what you did with those knobs.

04:40.918 --> 04:43.453
Polished brass.

04:43.454 --> 04:46.222
Looks like you want to polish his brass.

04:46.223 --> 04:48.791
And how do you like the
satin on the sconces?

04:48.792 --> 04:50.727
Oh, my God.

04:50.728 --> 04:52.495
My knees are wiggling.

04:52.496 --> 04:53.963
You like that?

04:53.964 --> 04:56.432
- And the finish on the molding?
- Oh, love it!

04:56.433 --> 04:58.800
I think she's about to
finish on the molding.

05:00.670 --> 05:02.815
You're the only man
who knew what I wanted

05:02.816 --> 05:04.450
without me having to
tell him three times

05:04.451 --> 05:06.219
and then give up.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.320
Hey, great.

05:07.321 --> 05:08.624
I'll tell the boss you liked it.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.556
"Bobby, you did it again."

05:10.557 --> 05:12.020
In case you missed it, I'm the boss.

05:14.027 --> 05:15.314
See, 'cause he's the boss,

05:15.315 --> 05:17.616
so he was telling himself.

05:17.617 --> 05:20.252
It's too many levels for her.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.220
Hey, um, listen, I
should probably get going,

05:22.221 --> 05:24.489
but if you need anything else,

05:24.490 --> 05:25.657
you can call me.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.160
Or my boss. Anytime.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.630
Well, I might just
have to call you both.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.164
Ciao!

05:34.766 --> 05:37.336
"Ciao"?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.404
Unless you're gonna
say "mein" after that,

05:39.405 --> 05:41.173
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.941
He's really cute.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.743
Oh, you think so?

05:44.744 --> 05:46.445
You were playing it
pretty cool, Maroline.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.753
Ooh, oops.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.188
Oh, don't worry,

05:56.189 --> 05:57.589
you can ruin everything in here.

05:57.590 --> 05:58.757
I don't care.

06:00.860 --> 06:01.927
I do.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.596
I just scrubbed the couch.

06:04.597 --> 06:07.833
How much longer do we
have to stay in here?

06:07.834 --> 06:10.969
Caroline's talking about
a third grade field trip.

06:10.970 --> 06:14.373
I got lost in Toronto.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.141
Girls, ignore them.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.976
Society does.

06:17.977 --> 06:19.011
Yeah.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.847
Uh, so where are your babies?

06:21.848 --> 06:23.115
Out parking the car?

06:24.884 --> 06:27.719
See, I don't let Barbara drive yet.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.487
Should I?

06:30.856 --> 06:33.125
We don't bring 'em to the meetings.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.493
They ruin everything.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.994
Starting with our vaginas.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.462
Oh, yeah,

06:37.463 --> 06:38.630
my husband ruined mine

06:38.631 --> 06:39.731
on my first date.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.303
See... well, see, I thought

06:45.304 --> 06:47.639
that a mother's group, you know, you...

06:47.640 --> 06:49.241
you talk about your babies.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.710
Wouldn't they love that?

06:51.711 --> 06:53.345
No, this is for us to...

06:53.346 --> 06:55.881
to trade pills and get trashed

06:55.882 --> 06:58.917
and fantasize about Gone
Girl-ing our husbands.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.988
Oh, my God, I'm doing everything wrong.

07:02.989 --> 07:06.591
Yeah, just like the '84
Olympics all over again.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.227
What's up, sluts?

07:11.329 --> 07:13.065
Ugh, there's a baby here?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.199
If I weren't already stoned,

07:14.200 --> 07:17.235
I'd drive somewhere else.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.171
My bad.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.405
Yeah, see,

07:20.406 --> 07:22.274
I thought we were gonna

07:22.275 --> 07:24.209
compare notes on bedtimes

07:24.210 --> 07:26.244
and how asleep a baby has to be

07:26.245 --> 07:28.113
to have sex in front of it.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.516
You have sex with your trainer too?

07:31.517 --> 07:33.702
Should I?

07:41.208 --> 07:43.410
Seeing what you girls
did to the dessert bar

07:43.411 --> 07:46.680
inspired me to make some
improvements around here.

07:46.681 --> 07:47.881
Don't tell me you found a way

07:47.882 --> 07:49.683
to unstick the menus from the tables.

07:49.684 --> 07:52.919
Whoa, one step at a time.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.122
I did give this place more of a facelift

07:55.123 --> 07:58.091
than Brad Pitt in preparation
for the movie Allied.

07:58.092 --> 08:00.927
Yeah, Han, this place
looks exactly the same.

08:00.928 --> 08:03.663
My suicide note is still
scrawled on the wall.

08:03.664 --> 08:07.334
Yeah, it looks like the
same old post office to me.

08:07.335 --> 08:09.602
It's not a freakin' post office!

08:12.005 --> 08:14.241
Max, we should really get
over to the dessert bar.

08:14.242 --> 08:17.277
Bobby's on his way to look
at those gorgeous sconces

08:17.278 --> 08:19.045
I am very unhappy with.

08:19.046 --> 08:21.014
Why do you have to use the dessert bar

08:21.015 --> 08:22.382
as an excuse to see him?

08:22.383 --> 08:23.983
If you like him, why don't you just say,

08:24.007 --> 08:26.119
"Hey, you're cute.
Want to see my horse?"

08:26.120 --> 08:29.556
Because a lady waits for a gentleman

08:29.557 --> 08:31.224
to ask to see her horse.

08:31.225 --> 08:33.226
I don't know what ladies
you're hanging out with.

08:33.227 --> 08:35.028
Apparently none.

08:35.029 --> 08:36.897
Ooh!

08:36.898 --> 08:38.131
Bobby's at the dessert bar.

08:38.131 --> 08:39.466
Let me just change into something

08:39.467 --> 08:40.734
a little more comfortable.

08:40.735 --> 08:42.936
Why are you making this so complicated?

08:42.937 --> 08:44.805
Why don't you just
say, "Let's get drinks

08:44.806 --> 08:46.472
to make the sex less awkward?"

08:49.276 --> 08:51.176
Or you could do that.

08:54.548 --> 08:58.952
Oh, hi, Bobby, I forgot
you were stopping by.

08:58.953 --> 09:02.722
She thought she was hosting
Wheel of Fortune in here.

09:02.723 --> 09:05.058
I'd buy a vowel from her.

09:05.059 --> 09:07.626
Well, it would be two As.

09:09.162 --> 09:10.497
Uh...

09:10.498 --> 09:12.232
oh, uh, what did you want to show me?

09:12.233 --> 09:14.935
Apparently a little side boob.

09:14.936 --> 09:16.069
This sconce.

09:16.070 --> 09:17.671
I noticed that if I put

09:17.672 --> 09:20.140
all the force of my body against it,

09:20.141 --> 09:21.174
it moves a little.

09:21.175 --> 09:23.276
See?

09:26.079 --> 09:27.447
Ugh, I...

09:27.448 --> 09:28.815
I must have jammed it into place

09:28.816 --> 09:30.817
while I was testing its virility.

09:30.818 --> 09:32.619
I mean, stability.

09:32.620 --> 09:34.687
Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh.

09:37.123 --> 09:39.659
See? Told you it was loose.

09:39.660 --> 09:41.795
I guess I have stick
around as long as it takes

09:41.796 --> 09:43.196
until it's fixed.

09:43.197 --> 09:46.600
Oh, good, because I wouldn't feel safe

09:46.601 --> 09:49.870
pulling aggressively on
anything until you do.

09:49.871 --> 09:51.504
Caroline!

09:51.505 --> 09:53.206
We got to get to the hospital.

09:53.207 --> 09:54.641
Oh, no, I'm fine.

09:54.642 --> 09:55.942
Bobby caught me.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.712
Not for you, Vanna Very White.

09:58.713 --> 10:01.314
I just got a call saying Randy
was in an accident in Manhattan.

10:01.315 --> 10:02.738
He must have been coming to see me.

10:02.739 --> 10:04.317
Just when I thought it was over,

10:04.318 --> 10:07.988
he ropes me back in with a
life-threatening emergency.

10:07.989 --> 10:09.322
How bad is he?

10:09.323 --> 10:11.191
Because these sconces

10:11.192 --> 10:13.526
won't be able to wear
this dress again tomorrow.

10:13.527 --> 10:15.629
All I know is that it's
serious, and they called me

10:15.630 --> 10:17.464
'cause I'm the emergency
contact on his phone.

10:17.465 --> 10:19.799
Okay. I'll be back as fast as I can.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.868
I'll work as slow as I can.

10:21.869 --> 10:24.170
I won't tell your
boss... 'cause he's the...

10:24.171 --> 10:25.504
I get it. Let's go.

10:28.241 --> 10:30.010
Oh, he's still alive.

10:30.011 --> 10:31.711
Oh, thank God his face isn't hurt.

10:31.712 --> 10:33.847
And... one, two, three, four, five, six.

10:33.848 --> 10:35.181
Yep, they're all there.

10:35.182 --> 10:37.751
Why is his shirt always off?

10:37.752 --> 10:40.754
He's like Kirsten Dunst
in a dramatic role.

10:40.755 --> 10:43.256
Well, I had to take his
shirt off, because...

10:43.257 --> 10:46.059
well, 'cause you know, he broke his leg.

10:46.060 --> 10:47.861
This is a private room.

10:47.862 --> 10:49.095
You ladies can't be in here.

10:49.096 --> 10:51.331
I'm his emergency contact, Max.

10:51.332 --> 10:53.366
I'll take the rest of his
clothing off from here.

10:53.367 --> 10:54.935
And can you get me a straw

10:54.936 --> 10:57.904
so we can share this
morphine drip Mai tai style?

10:57.905 --> 10:59.205
You girls have two minutes,

10:59.206 --> 11:00.840
and remember, this is a hospital,

11:00.841 --> 11:02.709
so no messing around.

11:02.710 --> 11:04.309
Ooh, that's my coconut oil.

11:06.379 --> 11:07.614
Coconut oil?

11:07.615 --> 11:09.249
Great, now he's edible.

11:09.250 --> 11:10.984
Oh, my God, Max.

11:10.985 --> 11:14.421
This is very An Affair to Remember.

11:14.422 --> 11:16.756
I'm more of a Quickie
to Forget kind of girl.

11:16.757 --> 11:20.193
No, that Randy came all the
way to New York to see you

11:20.194 --> 11:21.928
and then got into a tragic accident

11:21.929 --> 11:24.597
and now here you are at his bedside.

11:24.598 --> 11:27.467
Max, I don't want to
get ahead of myself,

11:27.468 --> 11:29.636
but we might both have boyfriends.

11:29.637 --> 11:34.374
Double date dance?

11:34.375 --> 11:36.042
Max?

11:36.043 --> 11:38.979
What are you doing here?

11:38.980 --> 11:40.580
Where's my shirt?

11:40.581 --> 11:42.983
When did Caroline start
hosting Wheel of Fortune?

11:42.984 --> 11:45.285
Ah, that's what I said!

11:45.286 --> 11:46.987
Um, I got the call that you were hurt,

11:46.988 --> 11:48.054
so I came right over,

11:48.055 --> 11:49.055
and as for your shirt,

11:49.056 --> 11:50.423
I think the nurses

11:50.424 --> 11:53.226
are making a pillow husband out of it.

11:53.227 --> 11:55.295
Hi, Randy, sorry you broke your leg,

11:55.296 --> 11:56.329
but great news.

11:56.330 --> 11:58.431
I like someone.

11:58.432 --> 11:59.632
Oh, that's right.

11:59.633 --> 12:01.801
You're still my emergency contact.

12:01.802 --> 12:03.003
I'm sorry.

12:03.004 --> 12:06.006
I never switched it back to my trainer.

12:06.007 --> 12:08.775
What happened? Was it
a runaway hot dog cart?

12:08.776 --> 12:10.677
Because that is my worst nightmare...

12:10.678 --> 12:14.180
besides having my credit
card declined at Kohl's.

12:14.181 --> 12:17.017
But I lived through it.

12:17.018 --> 12:20.420
I got hit by a cab on my way to JFK.

12:20.421 --> 12:21.604
You mean you got hit by a cab

12:21.605 --> 12:23.623
on your way from JFK.

12:23.624 --> 12:25.358
You were in New York to see me, right?

12:25.359 --> 12:27.360
Track me down, beg me to take you back,

12:27.361 --> 12:29.696
pull my hair a little?

12:29.697 --> 12:31.498
No, I was... I was leaving.

12:31.499 --> 12:32.966
Leaving? But you hadn't...

12:32.967 --> 12:33.967
Do you know what?

12:33.968 --> 12:35.168
The accident must have

12:35.169 --> 12:38.138
given him that "to-and-from-lexia."

12:38.139 --> 12:39.839
I think Whoopi Goldberg has it.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.509
Time's up, ladies. Patient
needs a sponge bath.

12:42.510 --> 12:44.778
He's got coconut oil all over him.

12:44.779 --> 12:46.046
Hey, Max, wait.

12:46.047 --> 12:48.181
She just got here. Didn't she?

12:48.182 --> 12:50.884
Told ya. He's got that
"come-and-go-heimers."

12:50.885 --> 12:52.452
Whoopi writes all about it in her book.

12:52.453 --> 12:54.753
It's very hard to follow.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:06.277 --> 13:08.612
Max, these are like pajamas

13:08.613 --> 13:10.380
for couples who don't care anymore.

13:11.782 --> 13:13.717
Speak for yourself.

13:13.718 --> 13:16.620
These puppies care a lot.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.555
Oh, good, they're all gone.

13:18.556 --> 13:21.492
They left me zero room to sign his cast.

13:21.493 --> 13:22.996
I want to get back to the dessert bar

13:22.997 --> 13:24.295
while Bobby's still there

13:24.296 --> 13:26.563
and possibly working up a little sweat.

13:26.564 --> 13:28.332
Go ahead. I'll punch you out.

13:28.333 --> 13:29.700
But if you keep leaving early,

13:29.701 --> 13:31.244
they're gonna make you work Christmas.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.903
Nurse, we need all hands on deck.

13:32.904 --> 13:34.238
We've got a 41 in here,

13:34.239 --> 13:36.040
and he's a squirter.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.107
You... you're up, girl.
I had the last one.

13:45.983 --> 13:47.985
"Dear Randy, Nice ass.

13:47.986 --> 13:49.119
Nurse Barb."

13:49.120 --> 13:51.354
Well, that is good.

13:55.759 --> 13:57.160
Max.

13:59.263 --> 14:00.898
I didn't wake you, did I?

14:00.899 --> 14:03.367
But now that you're up,
why are you in New York?

14:03.368 --> 14:05.803
You said you were on
your way to the airport

14:05.804 --> 14:06.837
when you got hurt?

14:06.838 --> 14:09.239
I was.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.575
So you weren't here to see me.

14:11.576 --> 14:14.511
No, I was trying not to see you.

14:14.512 --> 14:16.180
Wow.

14:16.181 --> 14:17.181
I'm leaving.

14:17.182 --> 14:18.582
Max.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.851
Ow.

14:20.852 --> 14:22.486
You broke up with me.

14:22.487 --> 14:25.322
That time over the phone?

14:25.323 --> 14:27.791
You took that seriously? That's insane.

14:27.792 --> 14:31.495
The "This is a cry for
attention" was implied.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.565
What I heard was, "This
isn't enough for me,"

14:34.566 --> 14:36.589
and since we can't make
it work, it just... it's...

14:36.590 --> 14:37.968
it's too hard for me to see you.

14:37.969 --> 14:39.552
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard what you said

14:39.553 --> 14:41.372
on the movie set.

14:41.373 --> 14:42.840
In Texas?

14:42.841 --> 14:44.775
How'd you hear what I said on set?

14:44.776 --> 14:46.443
I was a zombie extra.

14:46.444 --> 14:48.712
Grow up.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.147
That was you.

14:50.148 --> 14:52.116
Everyone said I was
crazy because I thought

14:52.117 --> 14:54.018
I saw you and Caroline on set.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.687
My therapist put me on antidepressants.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.255
Yeah, well, joke's on them,

14:58.256 --> 14:59.799
'cause it really was me hanging there.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.191
Max, that's crazy.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.975
Why didn't you say
something when you saw me?

15:02.976 --> 15:04.795
Because you said you
were in a good place

15:04.796 --> 15:07.097
and you want to move
on, blah, blah, blah.

15:07.098 --> 15:08.766
And I don't want to hurt you anymore.

15:08.767 --> 15:11.568
But now I want to break your other leg.

15:11.569 --> 15:12.836
Max, look at us.

15:12.837 --> 15:15.172
I ran to the airport
and got hit by a cab

15:15.173 --> 15:16.340
trying to get out of here

15:16.341 --> 15:18.275
because I was tempted to see you.

15:18.276 --> 15:22.679
And you broke into a
hospital not to steal drugs.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.215
Maybe this relationship is bad for us.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.685
There's just so much squirting!

15:28.686 --> 15:31.454
Definitely for Caroline.

15:35.292 --> 15:36.393
I miss you.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.128
I miss you too.

15:38.129 --> 15:41.432
Then let's stop being crazy.

15:41.433 --> 15:42.533
Move to LA.

15:42.534 --> 15:45.369
You know, six years ago,

15:45.370 --> 15:47.237
I would've done that in a heartbeat.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.540
I would've thrown my bubblegum cigs

15:49.541 --> 15:51.308
and my nunchucks in a Safeway bag

15:51.309 --> 15:53.610
and been your lady.

15:53.611 --> 15:56.046
But it's different now. I'm different.

15:56.047 --> 15:57.281
I care about something,

15:57.282 --> 16:01.752
and I have people who count on me.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.654
I've built a life here.

16:03.655 --> 16:04.754
Damn it.

16:06.390 --> 16:09.992
Max, you know I can't
leave my firm in LA.

16:11.728 --> 16:15.399
So what happens now?

16:15.400 --> 16:16.666
I think we kiss good-bye.

16:20.871 --> 16:23.207
Mm-mm.

16:23.208 --> 16:25.476
Hmm, I think that might set us back.

16:25.477 --> 16:27.611
I mean, you're already in a bed,

16:27.612 --> 16:29.035
and these pants come off real easy.

16:29.036 --> 16:30.214
I think you know that.

16:30.215 --> 16:32.483
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

16:32.484 --> 16:35.886
How about a hug?

16:35.887 --> 16:37.855
Hmm.

16:37.856 --> 16:40.491
You really trust yourself
against the girls?

16:40.492 --> 16:43.994
Not even remotely.

16:43.995 --> 16:45.095
How about a handshake?

16:45.096 --> 16:47.197
There's nothing less sexual.

16:47.198 --> 16:49.299
Okay, but two pumps and we're out.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.601
I can't not make it sexual.

16:57.341 --> 17:00.277
You smell nice.

17:00.278 --> 17:02.211
I've got a lot of jerky in my pocket.

17:05.148 --> 17:06.282
Good news is,

17:06.284 --> 17:08.719
I saved a man's life.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.387
Bad news is,

17:10.387 --> 17:12.221
I left a ring inside him.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.462
Here's your flan-tini

17:18.463 --> 17:21.230
and a side of a bottle of tequila.

17:22.665 --> 17:24.501
Why are you so sad, Caroline?

17:24.502 --> 17:28.438
I mean, she doesn't have kids.

17:28.439 --> 17:30.007
Well, I did like this guy Bobby,

17:30.008 --> 17:31.842
but then I had to go
with Max to see Randy,

17:31.843 --> 17:33.710
and I got squirted on,

17:33.711 --> 17:35.879
and I didn't get back in
time to see him and possibly

17:35.880 --> 17:38.081
missed a chance at a
lifetime of happiness.

17:38.082 --> 17:39.715
Too much talking from the waitress.

17:43.221 --> 17:44.388
Uh, ladies,

17:44.389 --> 17:45.889
are all of the daddies

17:45.890 --> 17:47.658
still in the picture?

17:47.659 --> 17:49.893
'Cause I can't shimmy down a fire escape

17:49.894 --> 17:51.728
like I used to.

17:51.729 --> 17:53.130
That's so funny.

17:53.131 --> 17:55.165
If my doorman drops out of the rotation,

17:55.166 --> 17:56.433
I'll give you a call.

17:56.434 --> 17:59.903
Uh, let me give you my beeper number.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.772
Yep!

18:01.773 --> 18:05.475
I'm really having a
blast with my mom friends.

18:05.476 --> 18:09.980
Do you have an aspirin,
or a sledgehammer?

18:09.981 --> 18:11.804
Why do you want to hang
out with these ladies?

18:11.805 --> 18:12.783
They're mean.

18:12.784 --> 18:14.451
One of them tried to trip me.

18:14.452 --> 18:17.721
Yeah, that was me.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.790
Yeah, I... I was trying to impress them.

18:19.791 --> 18:22.059
Sophie, I wished my mom
cared enough about me

18:22.060 --> 18:23.627
to curl my baby eyelashes

18:23.628 --> 18:25.095
like you do for Barbara.

18:25.096 --> 18:26.563
Or just to intervene

18:26.564 --> 18:28.932
when a neighborhood dog took me away.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.267
Sophie,

18:30.268 --> 18:31.902
your text wasn't clear.

18:31.903 --> 18:35.072
Should Barbara wear the
leopard onesie with the jean hat

18:35.073 --> 18:37.507
or the jean onesie with the leopard hat?

18:37.508 --> 18:40.544
Also, I can't find any of her toe rings.

18:40.545 --> 18:43.614
Sophie, are you secretly
caring for your baby

18:43.615 --> 18:46.316
while we're having mom's group?

18:46.317 --> 18:47.317
You know what?

18:47.318 --> 18:48.919
Fine.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.320
Fine, I love my kid.

18:50.321 --> 18:52.322
Well, why don't you marry her?

18:52.323 --> 18:54.925
Should I?

18:54.926 --> 18:56.093
No.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.861
No, 'cause I'm a good mom,

18:57.862 --> 19:00.998
and a good mom doesn't marry her baby!

19:00.999 --> 19:03.600
At least not in this country.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.167
Let's go, baby.

19:09.673 --> 19:13.443
Well, Meghan's dog walker gave
her some cat tranquilizers.

19:13.444 --> 19:17.314
Why don't we go try those
in the Target parking lot?

19:17.315 --> 19:19.216
Ugh, I can't wait to be a mom

19:19.217 --> 19:22.486
so I can get the good cat tranqs.

19:22.487 --> 19:26.423
You know they didn't pay, right?

19:26.424 --> 19:28.659
Hey, uh...

19:28.660 --> 19:31.328
sorry to barge in, but I
can't stop thinking about...

19:31.329 --> 19:32.795
Her boo-tay?

19:34.364 --> 19:37.668
Uh, well, that table is really unsteady.

19:37.669 --> 19:38.769
If my boss knew,

19:38.770 --> 19:39.970
I'd be furious.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.738
I know, right?

19:41.739 --> 19:43.140
I thought it was just me,

19:43.141 --> 19:44.941
but I mean, look at it, I...

19:44.942 --> 19:46.009
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.277
I mean...

19:48.613 --> 19:50.147
Rock steady.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.382
Perfect, actually.

19:52.383 --> 19:54.985
Damn it.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.209
You can't think of anything
else that needs to be fixed?

19:57.210 --> 19:58.822
No, and it's really annoying.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.390
You know what else is annoying?

20:00.391 --> 20:03.193
You two not jammin'.

20:03.194 --> 20:06.096
You like each other. What's the problem?

20:06.097 --> 20:07.397
- So you like me?
- Yeah.

20:07.398 --> 20:08.899
- Okay, so I should call...
- Yes.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.901
Good, 'cause I was this
close to calling my cousins

20:10.902 --> 20:13.337
to come in and tear this place apart.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.005
- I'm gonna call you.
- Ciao mein.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.138
- What?
- Nothing.

20:19.242 --> 20:21.178
Wow, look at you.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.779
I'm gonna have to put the brakes on that

20:22.803 --> 20:24.448
40-Year-Old-Virgin sequel.

20:24.449 --> 20:27.017
I'm sorry I'm happy
when you're not happy.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.352
I am happy...

20:28.353 --> 20:29.920
for you.

20:29.921 --> 20:31.864
I know you said you didn't
want to talk about it,

20:31.865 --> 20:33.824
but why don't you just
go to LA to be with Randy?

20:35.727 --> 20:37.627
I can't go to LA.

20:37.628 --> 20:40.430
I mean, there's too much stuff here

20:40.431 --> 20:42.199
they don't have there, like...

20:42.200 --> 20:43.900
the Statue of Liberty.

20:43.901 --> 20:45.068
You know she's my girl.

20:45.069 --> 20:47.571
You never want to go.

20:47.572 --> 20:48.939
And she invited us when she said,

20:48.940 --> 20:50.841
"Bring us your poor."

20:50.842 --> 20:53.343
Plus, where would I
find weed in California?

20:53.344 --> 20:55.544
I mean, the list goes on and on.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.815
I wouldn't leave you either.
