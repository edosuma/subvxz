WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.704
[siren blaring]

00:03.737 --> 00:04.572
- I NEED YOU TO MOVE, JOHN.
WE'RE LOSING HIM.

00:04.605 --> 00:05.539
- SH--. TWO MINUTES AWAY.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.208
- ALMOST NO PULSE.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.709
- COME ON, SIR.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.344
HEY, I THINK HE'S TRYING
TO SAY SOMETHING.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.312
HE'S TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING.
- HE'S IN V-FIB.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.547
WE GOTTA SHOCK HIM.

00:13.581 --> 00:14.982
- I-I LOVE--
- HE'S TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.384
WHAT IS IT, SIR?
COME ON, SIR.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.351
- GET READY TO CLEAR, BRI.
- WHAT IS IT?

00:17.385 --> 00:19.487
- TA CAFFERIN...

00:19.520 --> 00:21.489
- BRI?

00:21.522 --> 00:24.092
- [mumbling]
I LOVE HER.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.259
- CLEAR.

00:25.293 --> 00:29.363
[flatlining]

00:29.397 --> 00:31.265
CLEAR.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.433
[flatlining]

00:32.466 --> 00:34.202
CLEAR.

00:34.235 --> 00:37.371
- SH--.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.906
HE CLEARLY SAID,
"TELL CATHERINE I LOVE HER."

00:38.939 --> 00:40.241
- I HEARD,
"CATHETER'S BROKEN."

00:40.274 --> 00:41.842
- CATHETER?
YOU WERE TOO FAR AWAY.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.077
- I WAS RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.
- WHAT'D YOU HEAR?

00:43.111 --> 00:44.112
- "THE CATHOLIC POKER."

00:44.145 --> 00:45.579
- WHAT THE HECK
WOULD THAT MEAN?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.047
- MAYBE SOME PRIEST
HAD A HARD-ON FOR HIM.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.782
PEOPLE SAY STRANGE SH--
WHEN THEY KICK, BRIAN.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.451
WE HAD A GIANT BROTHER
GO ON US FOUR MONTHS AGO.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.420
SAME DEAL,
HEART ATTACK, 52,

00:52.453 --> 00:53.921
BUILT LIKE A BRICK SH--HOUSE,

00:53.954 --> 00:56.724
EX-HEAVYWEIGHT BOXER,
NECK THE SIZE OF AN SUV.

00:56.757 --> 00:57.525
- HE CALLS ME CLOSE,
I LEAN IN.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.127
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.361
"HANNAH MONTANA."

01:00.394 --> 01:01.695
- HAD AN OLD LADY
LAST SUMMER.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.864
96-YEAR-OLD
GREAT GRANDMOTHER,

01:03.897 --> 01:06.267
WHITE, JEWISH,
SURVIVED AUSCHWITZ.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.268
YOU KNOW WHAT
HER LAST WORDS WERE?

01:07.301 --> 01:08.802
"SALSA."

01:08.836 --> 01:10.738
- I HOPE MY DYING WORDS
ARE HAPPY.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.373
- I HOPE MY DYING WORDS ARE
"THAT WAS THE BEST

01:12.406 --> 01:13.607
"BLOW JOB EVER.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.042
THANK YOU,
NEIL PATRICK HARRIS."

01:15.075 --> 01:16.610
- HE WAS WEARING
A WEDDING RING.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.279
I OWE IT TO HIS WIFE
TO TELL HER THAT

01:18.312 --> 01:20.080
HIS DYING BREATH,
THE LAST WORDS

01:20.114 --> 01:21.415
HE EVER SPOKE
ON PLANET EARTH,

01:21.449 --> 01:23.817
INVOLVED HIS ETERNAL LOVE
FOR HER.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.386
- BRIAN, WE HAVEN'T
EVEN ESTABLISHED

01:25.419 --> 01:27.155
THAT HE SAID THE WORD
"CATHERINE."

01:27.188 --> 01:28.556
AND EVEN IF HE DID,
HE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT

01:28.589 --> 01:30.391
HIS CAMARO OR HIS DICK.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.892
- WHO NAMES
THEIR DICK CATHERINE?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.494
- A GUY WHO DRIVES A CAMARO.
- OKAY.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.296
- I'M SORRY, MRS. HARRIS,

01:35.329 --> 01:37.465
BUT WE DID
ALL THAT WE COULD DO.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.733
- OH.
[crying]

01:39.767 --> 01:41.335
- HARRIS?
THAT'S HER.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.736
THAT'S CATHERINE,
THE GUY'S WIFE.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.138
- BRIAN, DO NOT
GET INVOLVED.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.306
- BRIAN, SOMETIMES
WE SAVE LIVES.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.607
SOMETIMES WE CAN'T.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.108
BUT WE DO NOT
CROSS THE LINE

01:48.142 --> 01:49.677
WHEN IT COMES TO A FAMILY
IN THEIR GRIEF.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.113
- HE LOVED HER.
I OWE IT TO HIM.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.949
IT IS MY MORAL OBLIGATION.

02:00.321 --> 02:04.692
I-I WORKED ON
TRYING TO SAVE MR. HARRIS.

02:04.725 --> 02:08.329
AND HE HAD SOME IMPORTANT

02:08.362 --> 02:10.364
PARTING WORDS
FOR HIS WIFE.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.099
- OH, MY GOD.
- YES.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.436
IT WAS VERY TOUCHING.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.738
HE SAID, "TELL C--

02:19.240 --> 02:24.912
AGNES I SAID HI."

02:27.248 --> 02:29.149
- CAHAGNES?

02:29.183 --> 02:31.552
- HE HAD SOME
TRACHEAL BLOCKAGE.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.986
- IT'S, LIKE, A THROAT THING.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.355
[coughs] CAHAGNES.
IT'S VERY COMMON.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.623
- OH.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.292
WELL, WHY WOULD HE
JUST SAY HI?

02:38.326 --> 02:40.027
- MA'AM, DID YOUR--
DID YOUR HUSBAND--

02:40.060 --> 02:42.830
DID HE DRIVE A CAMARO?

02:42.863 --> 02:44.498
- I'M SORRY,
MA'AM, HE'S NEW.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.799
WHAT YOUR HUSBAND SAID WAS,

02:45.833 --> 02:47.067
"TELL AGNES
THAT I LOVE HER."

02:47.100 --> 02:48.402
- "SHE MADE LIFE
WORTH LIVING."

02:48.436 --> 02:50.170
- AND THEN HE SMILED.
- PASSED ON.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.306
- OH, MY GOD.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.174
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.577
- YES, IT WAS.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.413
- WE'RE SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.518
- WE GOT TO GO.

03:04.552 --> 03:07.221
[funky music]

03:07.255 --> 03:10.491
*

03:10.524 --> 03:11.992
- I DON'T TELL LIES.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.594
I LIVE MY LIFE ACCORDING
TO A MORAL COMPASS.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.062
DON'T YOU GUYS?

03:15.095 --> 03:16.230
- NO, I DON'T HAVE
A MORAL COMPASS.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.698
I GOT A MORAL GPS, OKAY?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.099
IT OFFERS UP THREE ROUTES

03:19.132 --> 03:20.568
IN ALMOST
ANY GIVEN SITUATION:

03:20.601 --> 03:22.336
A WHITE LIE,
AN OFF-WHITE LIE,

03:22.370 --> 03:25.172
AND THE LONG, LONELY ROUTE
OF TRUTH AND HONESTY

03:25.205 --> 03:26.607
THAT SKIPS ALL TOLL ROADS

03:26.640 --> 03:28.208
AND USUALLY ENDS
IN COMPLETE DISASTER,

03:28.242 --> 03:30.043
WHICH IS WHY
I RARELY TAKE IT.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.379
- MY PENIS IS MY COMPASS.
- AND IT ONLY POINTS

03:31.412 --> 03:33.046
IN ONE DIRECTION: THERESA.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.048
- YOU JUST MADE MY COMPASS
SEEM A LOT LESS COOL.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.884
- I THINK WE SHOULD LOCATE
THIS CATHERINE LADY.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.519
- MY DICK SAYS
WE SHOULD LOCATE LUNCH.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.354
- SHE WAS THE LOVE
OF HIS LIFE, JOHNNY.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.390
- NO, HIS WIFE WAS.
WE JUST TOLD HER SO.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.591
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
LOOK UP

03:43.624 --> 03:45.092
EVERY CATHERINE IN CHICAGO?
BESIDES,

03:45.125 --> 03:46.427
IS CATHERINE WITH A "C"?
KATHERINE WITH A "K"?

03:46.460 --> 03:47.795
- AND YOU KNOW THERE'S
A BLACK GIRL

03:47.828 --> 03:48.729
OUT THERE SPELLING IT
WITH A "Q".

03:48.762 --> 03:49.563
- OH, WE DO LOVE OUR Qs,

03:49.597 --> 03:50.698
EXCEPT FOR KWANZAA.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.132
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HELL

03:52.165 --> 03:53.401
WE DROPPED THE BALL
ON THAT ONE.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.136
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
[shushes]

03:56.169 --> 03:57.405
I GUESS WE'RE GETTING MEXICAN.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.708
- [laughs]

04:00.741 --> 04:01.909
KNOW WHAT'S
EVEN MORE DISTURBING

04:01.942 --> 04:03.644
THAN BRIAN'S MORAL COMPASS?

04:03.677 --> 04:04.812
- THAT JOHNNY'S PENIS
KNOWS WHERE TO GET

04:04.845 --> 04:06.714
THE BEST CARNITAS IN TOWN?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.549
THESE ARE AMAZING.
- MM-HMM.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.484
- THANK YOU, GOOD SIR.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.886
- AND NOW YOU'RE MAKING HIM
FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.254
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
THE FACT THAT

04:14.288 --> 04:15.723
A DEAD RINGER, JOHNNY--
AND I DO MEAN DEAD--

04:15.756 --> 04:17.090
FOR YOUR FATHER PASSED AWAY
IN THE RIG,

04:17.124 --> 04:18.826
AND YOU SEEM COMPLETELY
UNAFFECTED BY IT.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.394
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:20.428 --> 04:21.929
- BIG STRONG IRISH GUY.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.966
65 YEARS OLD.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.469
- WAIT.
- WHITE HAIR, BLUE EYES.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.604
- OH, MY GOD.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.240
- EVEN HAD THE SAME COLOGNE--
OLD SPICE.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.209
- IT'S A MASCULINE SCENT.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.847
- HOLY SH--.
THAT'S AWESOME.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.449
- WHY IS IT AWESOME?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.684
- UM, MY DAD LEFT MY MOM

04:43.717 --> 04:46.420
FOR A STRIPPER NAMED COCO
WHEN I WAS 13.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.855
THE FACT THAT
HIS DOPPELGANGER

04:47.888 --> 04:49.323
BIT THE DUST
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME

04:49.357 --> 04:51.024
AND I DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH,
THAT MEANS

04:51.058 --> 04:52.460
IT'S LIKE HE'S COMPLETELY
OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.495
THE GUY LOOKED AND SMELLED

04:54.528 --> 04:56.296
AND EVEN DRESSED
JUST LIKE MY OLD MAN,

04:56.330 --> 04:57.831
AND I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.333
IT'S LIKE THE GUY
DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.701
[giggles]
GO HIGH, BRO.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.769
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED

05:01.802 --> 05:02.836
TO YOUR FATHER, JOHN?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.137
- UH, I DON'T REMEMBER.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.306
- SEVEN YEARS, JOHN.
I KEPT TRACK.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.941
- SEVEN YEARS.
- MM-HMM.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.610
- WOW. GIVE ME SOME, BRIAN.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.812
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS, JOHNNY.
- WHAT?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.947
- IF THAT HAD BEEN YOUR DAD
WHO DROPPED DEAD TODAY,

05:13.981 --> 05:15.649
YOU WOULD HAVE MILES
AND MILES

05:15.683 --> 05:17.485
OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES WITH IT.
- N--

05:17.518 --> 05:19.019
- AND THEY WOULD HAUNT YOU--
AND ME,

05:19.052 --> 05:20.721
AS THE GUY WHO'S GOT TO LISTEN
TO YOU BITCH--

05:20.754 --> 05:22.055
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.691
- THIS IS SAD.
THIS IS REALLY SAD.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.193
IT'S LIKE A DEPRESSING
GUS VAN SANT MOVIE

05:26.226 --> 05:29.630
WHEN IT COULD BE
A ROB LOWE HALLMARK SPECIAL.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.299
- ROB LOWE?

05:32.332 --> 05:38.005
- YOU GUYS NEVER SAW
THE CHRISTMAS SHOES?

05:38.038 --> 05:40.641
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S SO GOOD.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.844
SOMETIMES, I EVEN WATCH IT
IN THE SUMMER.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.579
- YOU NEED
TO CALM HIM, JOHN.

05:45.613 --> 05:46.580
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO REACH HIM.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.815
- I'M SURE YOUR MOTHER DOES.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.417
- HOW CAN YOU HATE
YOUR OWN FATHER?

05:49.450 --> 05:50.918
- I DON'T HATE HIM.
I DON'T LOVE HIM.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.587
I HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR HIM
WHATSOEVER.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.922
- BULLSH--.
YOU TOOK ALL YOUR ANGER

05:54.955 --> 05:55.989
AND RESENTMENT FOR HIM,
AND YOU TURN 'EM

05:56.023 --> 05:57.758
INTO A MESS
OF COMMITMENT PROBLEMS

05:57.791 --> 05:59.493
THAT IS SCREWING UP YOUR DEAL
WITH THERESA.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.529
- STOP.
- THE COMPASS IN YOUR CROTCH

06:01.562 --> 06:02.730
KNOWS SHE'S THE HOTTEST CHICK
YOU'LL EVER BE WITH,

06:02.763 --> 06:04.364
BUT YOUR FEARS
ABOUT YOUR FATHER

06:04.398 --> 06:07.000
HAVE INFECTED
YOUR THICK IRISH BRAIN.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.736
FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY
OF CIVILIZATION

06:08.769 --> 06:11.104
A MAN'S COCK IS ACTUALLY
SMARTER THAN HE IS.

06:11.138 --> 06:14.374
LOOK UP YOUR DAD,
AND FACE HOW YOU FEEL.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.275
- YOU KNOW WHAT, HANK?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.444
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.011
I SHOULD LOOK HIM UP,

06:18.045 --> 06:20.213
TO THANK HIM.

06:20.247 --> 06:24.885
BECAUSE HIM ABANDONING
MY MOM AND I FOR COCO,

06:24.918 --> 06:26.687
BEST THING THAT
EVER HAPPENED TO US.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.357
WE BONDED, LIKE TWO PEAS
IN A POD.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.725
I MEAN, SURE THERE
WAS SOME DOWNSIDES,

06:31.759 --> 06:33.427
LIKE I WAS NEVER ALLOWED

06:33.461 --> 06:37.297
TO HAVE COCOA PUFFS
IN THE HOUSE.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.100
BUT THAT WAS MORE
THAN MADE UP FOR

06:40.133 --> 06:42.970
BY HER TEACHING ME
HOW TO SHAVE,

06:43.003 --> 06:45.706
AND HOW TO DRIVE,

06:45.739 --> 06:46.807
AND HOW TO HIT A CURVEBALL.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.309
I MEAN, WE WERE
ALWAYS TOGETHER.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.578
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE YOUR MOM

06:50.611 --> 06:51.645
TAKE YOU TO A BULLS GAME?

06:51.679 --> 06:54.114
NO, YOU DON'T.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.584
I BET YOU NEVER
WENT TO A BEARS GAME

06:56.617 --> 06:59.553
WITH YOUR MOM, AND HAD HER
MAKE YOU WEAR MITTENS...

06:59.587 --> 07:01.822
[knocks]

07:01.855 --> 07:05.559
WHEN YOU'RE 14.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.160
I BET YOU NEVER
SAT WITH YOUR MOM

07:07.194 --> 07:09.630
AT A BLACKHAWKS GAME,
AND SAW SOME FRIENDS

07:09.663 --> 07:12.299
FROM SCHOOL WATCHING
WHILE SHE TOOK HER SALIVA

07:12.332 --> 07:14.602
AND SLICKED BACK
YOUR HAIR.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.336
ONLY YOU CAN'T
TELL HER TO STOP,

07:16.369 --> 07:17.571
'CAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
IF YOU HURT HER FEELINGS,

07:17.605 --> 07:18.739
SHE'S GONNA
ABANDON YOU TOO.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.608
SH--. MY COCK IS SMARTER
THAN I AM.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.744
AND I GOTTA DEAL WITH
FINDING MY GODDAMN DAD.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.814
MOTHER--
[growls]

07:31.552 --> 07:32.853
- I'M TELLIN' YA,
THIS IS ALL COVERED

07:32.886 --> 07:34.822
IN THE CHRISTMAS SHOES.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.661
[doorbell buzzes]

07:40.694 --> 07:42.630
- WHO IS IT?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.464
- T?
- HEY.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.133
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.868
- PICKING YOUR MOM UP
FOR YOGA.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.437
- MY MOM DOES YOGA?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.606
- YEAH.

07:52.640 --> 07:56.510
- UM, IS SHE WEARING
YOGA PANTS?

07:56.544 --> 07:59.312
- NO, SHE'S NAKED.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.949
- I DON'T WANNA SEE
MY MOM'S ASS IN YOGA PANTS,

08:01.982 --> 08:02.883
SO MAKE SURE
SHE'S SITTING DOWN

08:02.916 --> 08:04.451
WHEN I GET UP THERE.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.986
- I'M A SEXUAL BEING,
JOHNNY.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.422
- MOM, THAT'S THE--
[buzz]

08:11.491 --> 08:13.060
- HEY.
BY THE WAY,

08:13.093 --> 08:15.295
THERESA SAYS I LOOK GREAT
IN THESE YOGA PANTS.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.865
WHAT WAS THE WORD YOU USED?
- LUSCIOUS.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.867
- MY ASS LOOKS LUSCIOUS.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.034
- AND I HAVE NO DOUBT.
IT'S JUST THAT

08:21.068 --> 08:22.970
IF I SEE YOUR ASS
IN YOGA PANTS,

08:23.003 --> 08:24.572
ANY TIME I SEE ANOTHER GIRL'S
ASS IN YOGA PANTS,

08:24.605 --> 08:26.707
I'M GONNA BE THINKING
ABOUT YOUR ASS.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.142
AND THAT'S NOT REALLY
WHAT A SON

08:29.176 --> 08:31.311
WANTS TO BE THINKING
ABOUT HIS MOTHER.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.715
AND IT WOULD BASICALLY
RUIN YOGA PANTS FOR ME.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.149
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.718
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.052
YOU BROKE UP WITH HER,
I DIDN'T.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.353
- YEAH. I JUST THOUGHT
YOGA WOULD BE

08:40.387 --> 08:42.155
A GREAT STRESS RELIEVER
FOR YOUR MOM,

08:42.189 --> 08:43.691
AND A GOOD WAY FOR HER
TO MEET GUYS.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.593
- OH, TELL HIM
ABOUT PIETRO.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.027
- I DON'T NEED
TO HEAR ABOUT PIETRO.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.662
- HE'S THE HOT BOX YOGI.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.764
- A VERY YOUNG INSTRUCTOR,
OF SPANISH DESCENT,

08:50.798 --> 08:52.766
THAT HAS A THING
FOR YOUR MOM.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.267
- I LOVE THE HOT BOX.
- MM-HMM.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.003
- EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT
WE HAVE A HOT BOX SESSION.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.071
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT
LUSCIOUS ASS IN YOGA PANTS?

08:58.105 --> 08:59.940
YOU SHOULD SEE PIETRO

08:59.973 --> 09:01.074
LEAD THE THURSDAY
HOT BOX SESSION.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.710
- MA, STOP SAYING THE WORDS

09:02.743 --> 09:04.612
"HOT" AND "BOX"
TOGETHER, PLEASE.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.780
AND I DON'T WANNA HEAR ABOUT
MY MA AND MY GIRLFRIEND

09:06.814 --> 09:09.349
TROLLING YOGA CLASSES
FOR SKINNY SPANISH GIGOLOS.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.753
- OH, OH, FIRST OF ALL,
MOM AND EX-GIRLFRIEND.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.121
AND WE ARE NOT TROLLING.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.123
THOSE YOGIS
ARE COMING ON TO US.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.958
- MM-HMM.
- AND I AM SEXUAL BEING

09:17.991 --> 09:20.260
IN MY SEXUAL PRIME, AND
I WILL SAY "HOT" AND "BOX"

09:20.293 --> 09:21.862
TOGETHER IN THE SAME SENTENCE
WHENEVER I WANT.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.965
HOT BOX.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.541
[both exhale]

09:34.574 --> 09:35.809
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
ANYWAY?

09:35.843 --> 09:36.977
- I WANNA GET
DAD'S INFORMATION.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.111
I WANNA RECONNECT.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.981
- WHAT? WHAT FOR?

09:41.014 --> 09:44.084
- I-I HAVE SOME UNRESOLVED
FEELINGS ABOUT HIM.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.819
- WHAT IS WITH YOU
AND THE FEELINGS?

09:45.853 --> 09:47.888
ALWAYS WITH THE FEELINGS.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.222
I MEAN, YOU WANNA
WORRY ABOUT FEELINGS?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.991
WORRY ABOUT
THERESA'S FEELINGS.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.960
HOW ABOUT WORRY
ABOUT THERESA'S ASS?

09:52.993 --> 09:55.996
HER ASS, IN THOSE PANTS,
IS A PENIS MAGNET.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.231
YOU SHOULD SEE HOW THE GUYS
OGLE HER AT THE GYM.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.667
THE OTHER NIGHT
I COUNTED FIVE ERECTIONS.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.969
- WHAT? WHY ARE YOU
COUNTING ERECTIONS?

10:02.002 --> 10:04.738
- THEY WERE POINTED
RIGHT AT ME.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.073
IT FELT LIKE I WAS
DOING A PRESS CONFERENCE.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.908
- OH.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.977
- YOU DON'T HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HIS DAD ANYMORE?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.411
- YEAH, SURE I DO.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.113
HE SHOULD DIE
IN A FIERY CAR CRASH.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.581
- THIS IS A MAN
YOU USED TO LOVE.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.317
- LOVE'S FICKLE.
REVENGE IS FOREVER.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.319
I'M OLD-SCHOOL IRISH,
THERESA.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.121
IN THE DOOLEY TRIBE,
WE HOLD TWO THINGS VERY CLOSE:

10:21.154 --> 10:23.590
GRUDGES AND WHISKEY.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.825
AND I DON'T LIKE WHISKEY.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.426
- [laughs]

10:26.459 --> 10:28.595
- OH, MY HAMMIES
FEEL SO SUPPLE NOW.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.163
- [grunts]
OH.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.765
- MOM, DO YOU HAVE
DAD'S NUMBER OR NOT?

10:31.799 --> 10:32.766
- IF I DID,
HE'D BE DEAD ALREADY.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.501
- I HAVE IT.

10:34.534 --> 10:37.570
- YOU NEVER EVEN
MET THE MAN.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.508
- I AM REALLY
OLD SCHOOL IRISH.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.311
IN THE KELLY CLAN,
WE BELIEVE THAT DIVORCE,

10:44.344 --> 10:45.846
NO OFFENSE, IS FOR PUSSIES.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.047
AND THE BEST WAY
TO KEEP A GRUDGE

10:47.080 --> 10:48.816
IS UNDER THE SAME ROOF.

10:48.849 --> 10:49.883
I FIGURED
IF OUR RELATIONSHIP

10:49.917 --> 10:51.218
WASN'T GONNA WORK OUT,

10:51.251 --> 10:52.119
BECAUSE OF YOUR
COMMITMENT ISSUES,

10:52.152 --> 10:53.854
THEN ONE OF US
WAS GONNA BE

10:53.887 --> 10:56.289
WANTING SOME ANSWERS
OUT OF YOUR OLD MAN.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.059
SO I'VE BEEN KEEPING AN EYE
ON HIS INFORMATION.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.894
DON'T CALL HIM FIRST.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.796
HE MAY WEASEL OUT
OF MEETING WITH YOU.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.465
DO WHAT WE DO--
AMBUSH HIM.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.134
- WHEN YOU SAY "WE,"
YOU MEAN THE COPS

11:07.167 --> 11:08.736
OR THE KELLY CLAN?

11:08.769 --> 11:09.903
- BOTH.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.204
- [laughs]

11:11.238 --> 11:13.540
WHOA.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.747
- FRANCIS HARDING HARRIS.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.214
ATTENDED BROTHER RICE
HIGH SCHOOL,

11:21.248 --> 11:23.483
GRADUATING CLASS OF 1969.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.418
I GOOGLED HIM,
CROSS-REFERENCED THE INFO

11:25.452 --> 11:27.320
FROM HIS OBITUARY,
AND FOUND HIS HIGH SCHOOL'S

11:27.354 --> 11:30.023
WEBSITE, AND HIS GRADUATING
CLASS' FACEBOOK PAGE.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.492
THEY'RE ABOUT READY
TO HAVE THEIR 45TH REUNION,

11:32.525 --> 11:35.195
AND JUST POSTED PHOTOS
FROM THEIR '69 YEARBOOK ONLINE.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.997
BAM!

11:37.030 --> 11:40.167
FRANK HARRIS AND
CATHERINE O'CONNELL--

11:40.200 --> 11:41.835
KING AND QUEEN OF
THE BROTHER RICE

11:41.869 --> 11:43.737
1969 SENIOR PROM.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.839
AND I HAVE A MAILING ADDRESS
FOR HER.

11:45.873 --> 11:49.376
- BRIAN--
- CSI: CHICAGO ON YOU, BABY!

11:49.409 --> 11:52.679
THE LOST VALENTINE, HANK.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.915
JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT,
BETTY WHITE,

11:54.948 --> 11:58.185
THE SAME EXACT THEME:
CLOSURE.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.853
THIS WOULD ALL
BE SO MUCH EASIER

11:59.887 --> 12:01.621
IF YOU'D JUST WATCH
THE HALLMARK CHANNEL, HANK.

12:01.654 --> 12:02.790
- HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN A BLACK MAN

12:02.823 --> 12:04.191
WATCH THE HALLMARK CHANNEL?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.625
- NO.
- AND YOU NEVER WILL.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.194
LOOK. THIS IS AGAINST
COMPANY POLICY

12:07.227 --> 12:09.029
AND ALL COMMON SENSE.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.563
WHAT IF SHE'S DEAD?

12:10.597 --> 12:12.632
- THEN MY MORAL COMPASS
CAN GO BACK TO WORRYING

12:12.665 --> 12:14.935
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE
AND THE CANADIAN SEA OTTER.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.469
THEY'RE SMALL,
THEY'RE FURRY,

12:16.503 --> 12:18.772
AND THEY'RE RUNNING OUT
OF CLAMS, HANK.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.207
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT
SHE WAS THE LOVE

12:20.240 --> 12:22.309
OF FRANK'S LIFE,
BUT WHAT IF FRANK

12:22.342 --> 12:24.377
WAS THE LOVE OF HERS?

12:24.411 --> 12:25.245
- OH, WELL, WHAT IF
SHE'S MARRIED,

12:25.278 --> 12:26.646
AND THE CURRENT HUSBAND

12:26.679 --> 12:28.215
IS AN INSANELY JEALOUS
EX-MARINE?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.716
WHAT IF SHE HAS
A DOBERMAN PINSCHER

12:29.749 --> 12:31.785
WHO HATES EVERYONE
EXCEPT HER?

12:31.819 --> 12:33.220
THIS COULD BE A MISTAKE
SO ENORMOUS,

12:33.253 --> 12:34.654
IT COMES BACK TO BITE YOU
IN THE ASS,

12:34.687 --> 12:38.591
LITERALLY,
AS YOU'RE MAKING IT.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.260
AND I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.829
LET'S GO.
- GOOD. THE SUBARU'S RUNNING.

12:41.862 --> 12:42.762
LET'S GO!

12:54.808 --> 12:56.243
- HEY, KID,
HOW THE HELL ARE YA?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.011
HOLY SH--, AM I GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.780
COME ON.
YOU WANNA HELP DADDY?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.089
GRAB AN END OF THIS,
HELP ME DRAG IT INSIDE.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.357
I WAS GONNA
GET A COUPLE GUYS

13:10.390 --> 13:12.092
FROM THE OLD FIREHOUSE,
BUT YOU'RE HERE.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.293
THIS'LL SAVE ME SOME TIME.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.428
- UH--
- HOW'S IT HANGIN'?

13:15.462 --> 13:18.866
- HOW'S IT HANGING?

13:18.899 --> 13:21.935
UM, OKAY.
- OH, I GET IT.

13:21.969 --> 13:22.836
YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.204
[grunts]

13:24.237 --> 13:26.306
- YOU MEAN I SHOULDN'T BE?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.141
- HEY, WHO TOLD WHO

13:28.175 --> 13:29.609
TO STAY THE HELL AWAY
FROM WHO, HUH?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.279
NOT ME. YOU SAID
I RUINED YOUR LIFE,

13:32.312 --> 13:33.346
SO I STAYED OUT OF IT.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.148
NOW YOU'RE PISSED
ABOUT IT?

13:35.182 --> 13:38.385
NOT MY PROBLEM.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.987
LISTEN.
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.855
- SHE STILL HATES YOU.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.190
- OH, CALL THE GODDAMN PAPERS.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.191
OF COURSE SHE HATES ME.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.692
SHE ALWAYS HATED ME.

13:45.725 --> 13:48.061
SHE HATED ME THE ENTIRE TIME
WE WERE MARRIED.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.129
- SHE DID?
- YEAH.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.898
SHE NEVER TOLD YOU THAT?

13:50.931 --> 13:52.966
- NO.
- OH.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.701
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "OH"?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.403
- UH, NOTHING, COME ON.
YOU'RE ALMOST UP THERE.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.404
THAT'S A BOY, KEEP GOING.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.007
THAT'S IT.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.412
- ARE YOU CATHERINE?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.180
CATHERINE O'CONNELL?

14:07.214 --> 14:09.149
- YES, WHY?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.218
- MY NAME IS BRIAN.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.053
HELLO.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.388
UH, I HAVE A MESSAGE
FOR YOU.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.590
- A MESSAGE FROM WHO?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.359
- FRANK HARRIS,
CLASS OF 19--

14:19.392 --> 14:21.428
- SAL!
GOD DAMN IT.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.364
FRANK'S HERE.
GET THE HELL OFF MY PORCH.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.833
- WHERE IS HE, HUH?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.068
- THIS IS A VIOLATION
OF THE RESTRAINING ORDER.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.937
- HEY, PLEASE,
WOULD YOU JUST--

14:29.970 --> 14:31.504
- OH, YOU'RE DOING GOOD, KID,
KEEP IT UP.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.574
- ASSHOLE, WHERE IS FRANK?
- CHECK THE BUSHES!

14:34.607 --> 14:36.209
- HE'S DEAD. HE'S DEAD.
FRANK IS DEAD.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.612
- HE'S DEAD?
- HE DIED OF A HEART ATTACK,

14:39.646 --> 14:40.914
IN THE BACK
OF OUR AMBULANCE.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.083
WE ARE EMTs.

14:43.116 --> 14:46.453
HIS FINAL WORDS,
WITH HIS FINAL BREATH,

14:46.486 --> 14:51.058
WERE, "TELL CATHERINE
THAT I LOVE HER."

14:51.091 --> 14:52.625
- [exhales]

14:52.659 --> 14:54.027
I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER
SEE THE DAY.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.528
THANK GOD.
- AHH.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.130
DO WE HAVE ANY CHAMPAGNE?
- YEAH.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.198
THERE'S A BOTTLE
IN THE FRIDGE

14:58.231 --> 14:59.466
LEFT OVER FROM NEW YEAR'S.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.735
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR TELLING US.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.110
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
WATCH THE WALLPAPER.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.711
THAT'S HAND-PAINTED SILK.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.446
IT COST ME A GODDAMN
ARM AND A LEG.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.781
COCO PICKED IT OUT
AT SOME PLACE

15:14.814 --> 15:17.084
NAMED GRIFFIN AND WONG.
IMAGINE THAT.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.986
A MICK AND CHINK
SELLING WALLPAPER TOGETHER?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.988
- YOU CAN'T SAY CHINK.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.256
YOU CAN'T SAY CHINK,
'MO, RETARD.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.591
WE GOT ALL THREE
DOWN AT THE FIREHOUSE.

15:24.624 --> 15:25.825
I CAN'T CALL 'EM THAT
NO MORE.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.060
- YOU HAVE
A RETARDED FIRE FIGHTER?

15:27.094 --> 15:28.561
- SEE, YOU JUST SAID IT.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.997
COME ON. LET'S GET
THIS COUCH UPSTAIRS.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.264
- N--I DIDN'T--
[sighs]

15:31.298 --> 15:32.332
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO MOVE A COUCH.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.434
- I KNOW. YOU CAME HERE

15:34.467 --> 15:36.903
TO TELL ME
TO KISS YOUR ASS.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.338
WELL, DO ME A FAVOR.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.440
LET'S GET THE COUCH
UPSTAIRS FIRST,

15:40.473 --> 15:42.609
BEFORE YOU TELL ME.
HOW'S THAT?

15:42.642 --> 15:44.677
- I CAME HERE
SO YOU COULD TELL ME

15:44.711 --> 15:46.980
WHY YOU LEFT ME AND MOM
HIGH AND DRY,

15:47.014 --> 15:48.615
AND ME WITHOUT A DAD,

15:48.648 --> 15:50.017
SO YOU COULD
SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.985
- SORRY FOR WHAT?
I PAID ALL THE BILLS.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.320
WILL YOU PULL,
FOR CHRIST SAKES?

15:53.353 --> 15:54.454
YOU GOT THE EASY PART.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.256
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS STEER.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.790
- LOOK.
- [grunts]

15:57.824 --> 16:00.460
- YESTERDAY, WE HAD A GUY
DROP DEAD ON US,

16:00.493 --> 16:03.463
MASSIVE HEART ATTACK.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.166
WE BROUGHT HIM BACK,
BUT THEN WE LOST HIM.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.668
SPITTING IMAGE OF YOU.
- YEAH, SO?

16:08.701 --> 16:13.106
- SO, BEFORE HE GOES,
HE HAS A FEW WORDS.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.176
- YEAH?
- YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS?

16:16.209 --> 16:18.045
- JESUS CHRIST.
IF I KNEW

16:18.078 --> 16:19.379
WHAT HE SAYS,
I'D BE A PSYCHIC.

16:19.412 --> 16:24.051
- HE SAYS...

16:24.084 --> 16:26.886
"TELL MY SON I'M SORRY."

16:31.024 --> 16:32.325
- MY LEFT NUT.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.726
NICE TRY.
NOW GET MOVIN'.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.994
- ALL RIGHT,
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.

16:35.028 --> 16:38.631
BUT JUST, LIKE,
SEEING HIM LAYING THERE,

16:38.665 --> 16:41.168
SEEING HIM DIE,

16:41.201 --> 16:42.502
IT GOT ME WONDERING
WHAT I WOULD,

16:42.535 --> 16:44.237
HOW I WOULD FEEL,
IF IT WAS MY DAD--

16:44.271 --> 16:46.339
IF IT WAS YOU.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.278
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.081
WELL, NOT RIGHT AWAY,

16:54.114 --> 16:55.315
BUT AFTER A COUPLE HOURS,
YEAH.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.516
- A COUPLE OF HOURS?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.085
YOU HATE ME THAT MUCH?

16:58.118 --> 17:00.053
AH, GO TO HELL,
KID, COME ON.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.254
- NO, WAIT--
NO, YOU DISAPPEARED

17:01.288 --> 17:04.091
ON ME WHEN I WAS 13.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.492
HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE,

17:05.525 --> 17:06.826
YOU NEVER CAME TO
ANY OF MY GAMES.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.195
AND THEN YOU SHOW UP
SEVEN YEARS LATER,

17:08.228 --> 17:09.862
GOD KNOWS WHY.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.398
- I SHOWED UP TO RECONNECT,
NUMB NUTS.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.433
ONLY TO HAVE YOU
TELL ME TO DISAPPEAR.

17:13.466 --> 17:14.901
IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY TIME

17:14.934 --> 17:16.569
I EVER DID
THE RIGHT THING BY YOU,

17:16.603 --> 17:17.670
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.572
NOW WILL YOU STOP
BEING SUCH A PUSSY

17:19.606 --> 17:22.575
AND GET THIS COUCH
UP THESE FREAKIN' STAIRS?

17:22.609 --> 17:25.245
- NAH.
- HEY!

17:25.278 --> 17:26.546
- I'M NOT DOING THIS.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.780
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA DO IT,
MISTER.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.582
PICK UP THAT GODDAMN COUCH
RIGHT NOW.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.418
- HOW ABOUT THIS?
- HEY!

17:31.451 --> 17:32.585
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:32.619 --> 17:34.254
- WHO'S THE PUSSY NOW,
OLD MAN?

17:34.287 --> 17:35.422
- I'LL KILL YOU,
YOU LITTLE PRICK.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.623
- OH!
- HEY!

17:36.656 --> 17:38.391
- OH!
- HEY!

17:38.425 --> 17:39.592
- WHAT, ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THIS WALLPAPER?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.261
HOW ABOUT THIS?
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

17:41.294 --> 17:42.795
- [laughs]

17:42.829 --> 17:44.131
- WHAT DID YOUR MOTHER
DO TO YOU?

17:44.164 --> 17:47.134
- [laughs]
- [screams]

17:52.672 --> 17:54.474
- OH, MY GOD.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.476
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.478
HOLY SH--.
D-DAD?

17:58.511 --> 18:01.281
DAD, HEY, YOU OKAY?

18:01.314 --> 18:03.082
YOU OKAY?
HEY, WAKE UP.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.152
HELLO. OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD, DAD.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.053
OH, I'M SORRY.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.555
I'M SO SORRY, DAD.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.591
- HA, HA.
YOU DO LOVE ME.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.226
[chuckles]

18:13.260 --> 18:14.727
- YOU'RE OKAY?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.429
- OF COURSE I'M OKAY,
YOU DAMN FOOL.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.299
I'VE TAKEN FALLS LIKE THAT
ALL MY LIFE ON THE JOB.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.302
AND YOU ARE JUST LIKE ME.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.836
- BULLSH--.
- OH, NO?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.338
YOU WONDERED WHAT YOU'D DO
IF YOU SAW ME

18:25.372 --> 18:26.673
LYING ON THE FLOOR, DYING.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.641
WELL, NOW WE KNOW.
YOU'D SAVE ME.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.810
JUST LIKE YOU TRIED TO SAVE
THAT GUY AT WORK.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.813
BECAUSE YOU'RE DEDICATED
TO THE JOB, JUST LIKE ME.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.782
PLUS, YOU SAID
YOU WERE SORRY.

18:35.815 --> 18:40.287
AND I ACCEPT THAT AS A BLANKET
APOLOGY FOR EVERYTHING.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.290
- HEY.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.226
- AH, WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
WRECK THIS ROOM TOO?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.598
YOUR MOM DIDN'T
WANT ME AROUND,

18:51.631 --> 18:54.167
SO I HAD TO TAKE
LONG LENS SHOTS.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.768
- WHAT, YOU'RE STALKING ME?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.437
- KIND OF HARD
TO PROVE IN COURT

18:57.470 --> 18:59.172
WHEN IT'S
A BLOOD RELATIVE, KID.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.540
LISTEN.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.275
I DIDN'T LEAVE YOU.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.676
YOUR MOM LEFT ME.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.144
I KNOW IT LOOKED LIKE
I LEFT,

19:05.178 --> 19:07.614
BECAUSE YOU GUYS
KEPT THE HOUSE.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.650
BUT SHE HATED ME,
AND I HATED HER.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.852
THE MARRIAGE WASN'T WORKING,

19:12.885 --> 19:14.487
BUT WE DECIDED
TO STICK IT OUT

19:14.521 --> 19:16.656
TILL YOU WENT TO COLLEGE.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.857
AND THEN ONE DAY
SHE TOLD ME

19:17.890 --> 19:22.028
TO JUST TAKE A HIKE,
SO I DID.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.764
I DIDN'T MEET COCO
TILL AFTER I MOVED OUT.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.303
THAT WAS AN AMAZING SAVE.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.639
[door opens]

19:32.672 --> 19:35.174
- WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?

19:35.208 --> 19:36.709
- OHH. HI, HONEY.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.312
JOHNNY CAME BY
AND WE DID A LITTLE, UH--

19:39.346 --> 19:40.713
- WE WERE CATCHIN' UP.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.749
- YEAH, WE GOT
ALL CAUGHT UP.

19:42.782 --> 19:46.586
- OH, MY GOD.
MY WALLPAPER!

19:46.619 --> 19:47.720
OH, BABY.

19:47.754 --> 19:52.492
- WHAT AN ASS ON HER, HUH?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.561
- I--

19:54.594 --> 19:56.596
- YEAH, IT WAS MY IDEA.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.365
YEAH, I ASKED HIM TO LEAVE.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.567
WE WERE A TERRIBLE MATCH.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.035
OF COURSE,
THEN I GOT JEALOUS.

20:03.069 --> 20:06.172
I RESENTED THAT
HE MET THIS YOUNG GIRL

20:06.205 --> 20:08.775
AND, YOU KNOW,
MOVED ON SO QUICK.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.744
BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN
IN MY LIFE--

20:11.778 --> 20:15.548
YOU.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.117
- AW.
- AW.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.954
- YOUR WORLD BECAME MY WORLD.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.190
YOU KNOW, DRIVING YOU BACK
AND FORTH TO BASEBALL GAMES

20:24.223 --> 20:28.728
AND BATTING PRACTICE,
BATTING CAGES.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.431
BASEBALL, BASEBALL,
BASEBALL.

20:31.464 --> 20:35.568
THAT WAS YOUR LIFE,
SO IT BECAME MINE.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.604
- YOU'RE A DEVOTED MOM.
THANK YOU.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.673
- YOU'RE WELCOME, HONEY.

20:44.777 --> 20:48.581
AND THAT'S WHY I SLEPT
WITH YOUR LITTLE LEAGUE COACH...

20:50.950 --> 20:52.552
AND YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COACH
AND THE HEAD COUNSELOR

20:52.585 --> 20:53.986
AT THE RON SANTO
BASEBALL CAMP.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.555
THERE, I FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER.

20:55.588 --> 20:59.626
- IS THAT WHY I WON
MOST IMPROVED AT CAMP?

20:59.659 --> 21:00.760
- NO, THAT WAS THE WEEK
YOU LEARNED

21:00.793 --> 21:03.930
TO HIT THE CURVEBALL.
- RIGHT.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.466
SO ARE YOU GONNA
LET THIS GRUDGE GO, OR WHAT?

21:06.499 --> 21:07.900
- [deep breath]

21:07.934 --> 21:10.637
FINE.

21:10.670 --> 21:14.774
I DON'T WANT HIM TO DIE
IN A FIERY CAR CRASH.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.643
BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF SKIN CANCER

21:16.676 --> 21:18.645
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?

21:18.678 --> 21:22.315
YOU KNOW, A TINY LITTLE
MELANOMA ON HIS NOSE.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.683
I GOTTA GO TO YOGA.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.319
MM. I GOTTA PUT ON
MY SPECIAL PANTS,

21:26.353 --> 21:27.687
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA LEAVE.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.589
- NO, IT'S COOL.
I'LL WAIT AND DRIVE YOU.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.491
I SAW COCO
IN HER YOGA PANTS TODAY,

21:31.524 --> 21:34.627
AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH
RUINED FOR ME FOREVER, SO--

21:34.661 --> 21:36.563
- HOW'D SHE LOOK?

21:38.665 --> 21:40.066
- FAT.
