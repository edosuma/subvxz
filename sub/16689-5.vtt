WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:04.170
TONIGHT ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,

00:04.203 --> 00:06.238
GORDON RIDES INTO TUCKAHOE,
NEW YORK

00:06.272 --> 00:07.273
AND FINDS A HANDYMAN...

00:07.306 --> 00:08.441
AH!

00:08.474 --> 00:10.142
WITH A DREAM THAT'S BECOME
A NIGHTMARE.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.311
IT'S THE
TABLE!

00:12.345 --> 00:14.914
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE OWNER
IS LACKING CONFIDENCE.

00:14.947 --> 00:16.515
I DON'T BELIEVE
THERE'S A BETTER OPERATOR

00:16.549 --> 00:17.850
OR RESTAURATEUR
THAN ME.

00:17.883 --> 00:19.251
READ THE  TICKET!

00:19.285 --> 00:20.653
THE RATHER ODD MENU

00:20.686 --> 00:22.088
HAS TURNED CUSTOMERS OFF.

00:22.121 --> 00:23.956
LOOK LIKE IT'D COME OUT
OF A BABY'S DIAPER.

00:23.990 --> 00:25.458
RIGHT. THAT SITS ON TOP.

00:25.491 --> 00:27.193
THE CHEF HAS LOST HIS WAY.

00:27.226 --> 00:28.828
DO I STILL HAVE PASSION
FOR FOOD?

00:28.861 --> 00:29.895
PLEASE HELP ME!

00:29.929 --> 00:30.000
NO.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.364
NO.

00:31.397 --> 00:33.332
AND IF GORDON CAN'T
GET THROUGH

00:33.366 --> 00:34.767
TO THIS CONTROL FREAK OWNER...

00:34.800 --> 00:36.669
YOU'RE A FAKE.
YOU'REA FAKE.

00:36.702 --> 00:38.771
THIS RESTAURANT WILL HAVE
NO CHOICE BUT TO CLOSE.

00:38.804 --> 00:41.040
'CAUSE WITH  PLATE
OF FOOD WE SEND,

00:41.073 --> 00:42.575
WE'RE NARROWING THE CHANCES
OF THIS PLACE

00:42.608 --> 00:43.976
BECOMING SUCCESSFUL.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.244
CAN GORDON RESTORE ORDER

00:45.277 --> 00:46.646
TO THE OLDE STONE MILL?

00:46.679 --> 00:49.882
I'M NOT TOO SURE
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY HUNGRY

00:49.915 --> 00:51.917
FOR THE CHANGE--
YOU KNOW THAT?

00:51.951 --> 00:53.619
OR HAVE THEY GROWN ACCUSTOMED
TO CHAOS?

00:53.653 --> 00:55.021
ARE WE SCARED
ABOUT BEING BUSY?

00:55.054 --> 00:56.455
YES.
WHAT?

00:56.489 --> 00:58.991
TONIGHT ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

01:02.028 --> 01:09.168
&#9834

01:19.645 --> 01:21.080
TUCKAHOE, NEW YORK.

01:21.113 --> 01:22.615
A WEALTHY OLD COMMUTER TOWN

01:22.648 --> 01:25.751
45 MINUTES NORTH
OF MANHATTAN

01:25.785 --> 01:28.554
AND HOME TO THE OLDE STONE MILL
RESTAURANT AND BAR.

01:28.587 --> 01:30.000
BUT NOW THE OLDE STONE MILL
IS IN DANGER

01:30.000 --> 01:30.790
BUT NOW THE OLDE STONE MILL
IS IN DANGER

01:30.823 --> 01:32.725
OF GRINDING TO A HALT
FOR GOOD.

01:32.758 --> 01:34.093
OKAY.

01:34.126 --> 01:36.162
SIX YEARS AGO,
I TOOK THIS PLACE

01:36.195 --> 01:39.732
AND I BEGAN MY QUEST
TO CONVERT THIS OLDE MILL

01:39.765 --> 01:41.600
INTO A RESTAURANT.

01:41.634 --> 01:43.335
AND HERE WE ARE.

01:43.369 --> 01:44.470
OPEN FOUR YEARS NOW.

01:44.503 --> 01:46.539
THEN WE TOOK A RISK.

01:46.572 --> 01:48.274
THERE'S NO INVESTORS HERE.

01:48.307 --> 01:49.742
YOU KNOW, WE BUILT IT OUT.

01:49.775 --> 01:52.178
I DID EVERYTHING IN HERE
MYSELF.

01:52.211 --> 01:53.779
IS THIS THE RIGHT SPOT?

01:53.813 --> 01:56.882
ALL THE WOODWORK,
THE CARPENTRY, THE PLUMBING.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.651
THE ONLY THING I REALLY
DIDN'T GET INVOLVED IN

01:58.684 --> 02:00.000
WAS THE ELECTRICAL WORK.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.419
WAS THE ELECTRICAL WORK.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.755
AH!

02:02.788 --> 02:04.023
OKAY.

02:04.056 --> 02:05.791
I DON'T BELIEVE
THERE'S A BETTER OPERATOR

02:05.825 --> 02:07.827
OR RESTAURATEUR
THAN ME.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.729
BUT NO ONE'S COMING IN...

02:09.762 --> 02:11.030
OR TRYING TO COME IN.

02:11.063 --> 02:12.565
EMBARRASSED THAT I CAN'T
GO OUT

02:12.598 --> 02:14.400
WITH THE SIDES THAT I NEED
FOR A TABLE.

02:14.433 --> 02:17.002
MY BOSS, DEAN,
HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS

02:17.036 --> 02:18.938
'CAUSE HE HAS COME IN
AND SCREAMED AT ME.

02:18.971 --> 02:20.840
- COME ON, MAN.
- READ THE  TICKETS.

02:20.873 --> 02:23.442
IT'S HORRIBLE.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.010
WHAT THE?

02:25.044 --> 02:28.581
DO I STILL HAVE PASSION
FOR FOOD?

02:28.614 --> 02:30.000
NO.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.082
NO.

02:30.116 --> 02:32.485
AND IT SHOWS.

02:32.518 --> 02:33.886
THERE WERE DAYS
I JUST COULDN'T THINK

02:33.919 --> 02:36.756
OF EATING THE FOOD.

02:36.789 --> 02:39.225
I EAT MY FOOD
AND MY FAMILY EATS MY FOOD

02:39.258 --> 02:41.994
AND I THINK IT'S GOOD.

02:42.027 --> 02:43.696
WE DON'T HAVE
A VERY YOUNG CROWD.

02:43.729 --> 02:45.064
THERE IS A ASSISTED
LIVING FACILITY

02:45.097 --> 02:46.799
RIGHT BEHIND US.

02:46.832 --> 02:50.469
AND WE DO HAVE A LOT
OF THE BLUE HEADS COME IN.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.571
THAT'S--THAT'S--THAT'S
THE CUSTOMER BASE.

02:54.473 --> 02:56.108
SERVICE, PLEASE.

02:56.142 --> 02:58.110
WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THE SERVICE

02:58.144 --> 03:00.000
BECAUSE IT IS VERY HARD
TO GET PEOPLE TO WORK HERE.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.012
BECAUSE IT IS VERY HARD
TO GET PEOPLE TO WORK HERE.

03:00.045 --> 03:01.847
CAN I GET SOMEONE HERE
TO CLEAN THIS SINK?

03:01.881 --> 03:04.150
MISSING A DISH HERE.
MISSING A KNIFE.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.718
LITTLE PIECE OF GLASS
ON THE TABLE.

03:05.751 --> 03:07.553
NEVER HURT ANYONE,
RIGHT?

03:07.586 --> 03:09.388
I HAVE A REOCCURRING
NIGHTMARE

03:09.421 --> 03:10.923
THAT I'VE HAD
FROM DAY ONE.

03:10.956 --> 03:13.392
WHAT HAPPENS IF I OPEN UP,

03:13.425 --> 03:14.994
STAFFED UP, FOOD READY,

03:15.027 --> 03:16.695
AND NO ONE DECIDES
TO COME HERE?

03:17.897 --> 03:19.899
WELL, IT HAPPENED
THIS YEAR.

03:19.932 --> 03:22.568
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T HAVE ANSWERS FOR THAT.

03:22.601 --> 03:23.969
I WISH I DID.

03:24.003 --> 03:25.905
WHEN YOU'RE MAKING NO MONEY,

03:25.938 --> 03:27.540
IT'S VERY HARD
TO CONVINCE YOU

03:27.573 --> 03:28.707
THAT TOMORROW IS GONNA BE
A BETTER DAY

03:28.741 --> 03:30.000
WHEN YOU HAVE BILLS
TO PAY.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.509
WHEN YOU HAVE BILLS
TO PAY.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.678
IT'S NOT THAT NICE
WHEN IT'S SLOW.

03:32.711 --> 03:34.713
A SLOW NIGHT
IS A LOT OF SAD FACES.

03:34.747 --> 03:36.782
YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.351
WELL, HE'S RIGHT.
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.886
LET EVERYBODY EARN MONEY

03:40.920 --> 03:42.621
AND LET DEAN TAKE IT
IN THE  AS ALWAYS.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.623
WHY AREN'T MORE PEOPLE
COMING HERE?

03:44.657 --> 03:46.325
I DON'T KNOW.

03:46.358 --> 03:47.993
I REALLY, REALLY DON'T KNOW.

03:48.027 --> 03:50.162
BEING BEHIND ON MY MORTGAGE

03:50.196 --> 03:52.398
AND THE THOUGHT OF THEM
FORECLOSING ON MY HOUSE,

03:52.431 --> 03:53.799
I JUST COUL--
I COULDN'T TAKE IT.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.067
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.669
HI, HONEY.
HI, BABE.

03:56.702 --> 03:57.837
I NEED MONEY
FOR DRY CLEANING.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.000
MONEY.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.239
MONEY.

04:00.272 --> 04:02.541
WHAT ABOUT THESE PEOPLE?
THINK THEY NEED MONEY?

04:03.709 --> 04:05.611
I THINK MY WIFE
MIGHT KNOW

04:05.644 --> 04:07.213
THESE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS

04:07.246 --> 04:09.181
HAVE BEEN THE WORST EVER
FOR ME.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.683
I'M GONNA BE UP HERE

04:10.716 --> 04:12.785
AND SEE WHO
THE LUCKY PEOPLE ARE

04:12.818 --> 04:14.420
THAT ARE GONNA
GET PAID TODAY.

04:14.453 --> 04:15.721
THIS RESTAURANT
ISN'T JUST A RESTAURANT.

04:15.754 --> 04:17.556
IT'S OUR LIFE.
IT'S OUR FUTURE.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.124
IT'S OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE.

04:39.411 --> 04:42.248
BEAUTIFUL.

04:42.281 --> 04:45.017
THANK YOU. BYE.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.759
ALMOST DROVE BY THIS PLACE.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.261
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING.

04:55.294 --> 04:57.563
WHAT SCARES ME
IS WHY NO ONE'S EATING HERE.

04:57.596 --> 04:59.465
I'M ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

04:59.498 --> 05:00.000
OH DEAR.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.066
OH DEAR.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.268
GORDON!

05:02.301 --> 05:03.936
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M DEAN MARRAZZO.

05:03.969 --> 05:05.437
NICE TO SEE YOU.
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.473
GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

05:07.506 --> 05:09.508
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,
THE GUY'S A WINNER.

05:09.541 --> 05:11.477
HIS MICHELIN STARS
ARE LIKE WORLD SERIES RINGS.

05:11.510 --> 05:12.611
HE'S GOT THEM.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.213
TOM.
TOM, HOW ARE YOU?

05:14.246 --> 05:15.748
NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:15.781 --> 05:17.349
THIS IS THE BARMAN, YES?

05:17.383 --> 05:18.884
THIS IS THE CHIEF COOK
AND BOTTLE WASHER HERE.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.286
OKAY. FANTASTIC.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.221
I KNOW HIS CREDENTIALS.
I KNOW HOW GOOD HE IS.

05:22.254 --> 05:23.989
I'M STARVING.
OH, OKAY.

05:24.023 --> 05:27.026
I DO BELIEVE GORDON
COULD HELP THE RESTAURANT.

05:27.059 --> 05:29.128
BUT HOW MUCH SO,
I DON'T KNOW.

05:29.161 --> 05:30.000
JEANIE, THIS IS
GORDON RAMSAY.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.096
JEANIE, THIS IS
GORDON RAMSAY.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.432
WHEN HE APPROACHED ME
AND PUT OUT HIS HAND,

05:33.465 --> 05:35.601
SAID HELLO TO ME,
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

05:35.634 --> 05:36.702
I LIKE BLOND MEN.

05:36.735 --> 05:37.903
SO HE WAS ADORABLE.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.605
JEAN. NICE TO SEE YOU.

05:39.638 --> 05:41.740
I FELT
A VERY WARM FEELING.

05:41.774 --> 05:43.008
SO GLAMOROUS.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.877
GORDON WOULD BE A PLUS
IN MY LIFE.

05:46.312 --> 05:47.646
THIS IS OUR MENU.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.981
JUST HAS A LITTLE HISTORY
ON ONE SIDE

05:49.014 --> 05:50.282
AND OUR MENU
ON THE OTHER.

05:50.316 --> 05:50.950
THANK YOU.
YOU GOT IT.

05:50.983 --> 05:52.418
HMM.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.324
LOVELY.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.000
I'LL START OFF
WITH CRAB CAKE.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.659
I'LL START OFF
WITH CRAB CAKE.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.328
I'D LIKE TO SEE, UH,
SHRIMP, PLEASE.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.429
I'LL HAVE THE CHOPPED
SALAD, PLEASE.

06:03.462 --> 06:05.230
THANK YOU.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.865
AND THEN FOR, UH,
MAIN COURSE,

06:06.899 --> 06:08.000
RISOTTO.

06:08.033 --> 06:09.335
AND THEN I'LL GO

06:09.368 --> 06:10.803
FOR THE TILAPIA
EN PAPILLOT.
TILAPIA.

06:10.836 --> 06:14.306
MICHAEL.
YOU DO THINGS YOUR WAY.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.841
I AM VERY NERVOUS.

06:15.874 --> 06:17.710
HE'S GONNA COME IN HERE,
I'M GONNA COOK FOR HIM,

06:17.743 --> 06:18.811
AND HE'S GONNA SAY "EGH."

06:18.844 --> 06:20.145
ARE YOU, UH,

06:20.179 --> 06:21.246
CHEWING GUM?

06:21.280 --> 06:22.247
YES, SIR.

06:22.281 --> 06:23.549
YOU ARE.
IS THAT NORMAL?

06:25.084 --> 06:26.118
I SUPPOSE.

06:26.151 --> 06:27.553
REALLY?

06:30.489 --> 06:31.957
APART FROM BEING SLOW,

06:31.991 --> 06:33.892
THE WAITERS THINK
IT'S NORMAL TO CHEW GUM.

06:33.926 --> 06:35.627
HEY.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.196
COME ON, LET'S GO.

06:37.229 --> 06:38.630
SEND IT OUT.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.165
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY
OF HIS CALIBER COME IN,

06:40.199 --> 06:41.734
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GONNA DO.

06:41.767 --> 06:44.403
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GONNA SAY.

06:44.436 --> 06:46.505
COOL. THANK YOU.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.545
IT TASTES REALLY STRANGE.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.214
I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER
ON IT.

06:55.247 --> 06:56.949
SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD
IN THERE.

06:56.982 --> 06:59.151
IT'S LIKE A SOUR MAYONNAISE
FLAVOR.

06:59.184 --> 07:00.000
I'M HOPING THAT HE LIKES

07:00.000 --> 07:01.587
I'M HOPING THAT HE LIKES

07:01.620 --> 07:03.355
ONE OF THE DISHES
THAT HE ORDERED.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.758
TWO OF THE DISHES.
MAYBE ALL OF THE DISHES.

07:05.791 --> 07:07.793
BLOODY HELL.

07:11.864 --> 07:14.433
WRAPPED IN PHYLLO PASTE,
DEEP FAT FRIED.

07:14.466 --> 07:16.368
I'VE EATEN SOME PRAWNS
IN MY LIFE, BUT  ME,

07:16.402 --> 07:18.037
THAT'S A FIRST.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.405
BLOODY HELL.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.808
IS THIS A POPULAR DISH
ON THE MENU?

07:22.841 --> 07:23.942
YES.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.111
WOW.

07:26.145 --> 07:28.280
SO FAR, I DON'T THINK
HE'S LIKED THE FOOD.

07:34.053 --> 07:36.555
WHAT IS THAT?
CHOPPED SALAD.

07:36.588 --> 07:38.424
OH CHOPPED SALAD.
SORRY. 'SCUSE ME.

07:38.457 --> 07:39.458
LOOK AT THAT.

07:39.491 --> 07:41.193
WHAT'S THAT SQUASHED INTO?

07:41.226 --> 07:43.862
LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN SQUASHED
INTO AN ICE CREAM CONE.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.497
OKAY.
THAT'S IT THERE.

07:45.531 --> 07:48.300
RIGHT. THAT SITS ON TOP.

07:48.333 --> 07:49.501
WAS THE CHEF
A MECHANIC?

07:49.535 --> 07:51.336
NO.
NO.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.138
ASIDE FROM ITS APPEARANCE,

07:53.172 --> 07:56.075
PEOPLE ACTUALLY
ENJOY IT.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.776
YOU KNOW, THIS IS MY HOUSE.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.945
HE WAS IN MY HOUSE
AND HE WAS EMBARRASSING ME.

08:03.082 --> 08:04.149
OKAY.

08:09.688 --> 08:12.391
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME EAT
ANY MORE OF THIS.

08:12.424 --> 08:15.094
TAKE THIS OUT WHILE THIS IS
STILL PUFFY, PLEASE.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.796
LOVELY. THANK YOU.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.500
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S
HAD A  IN THE BAG

08:21.533 --> 08:23.235
AND STUCK IT IN THE OVEN.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.005
DEAR.

08:27.039 --> 08:29.141
DISAPPOINTMENT WAS WRITTEN
ALL OVER HIS FACE.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.078
HE DOESN'T LIKE
ANY OF THE FOOD SO FAR.

08:33.112 --> 08:34.513
IT'S GROSS.

08:34.546 --> 08:36.081
PRETTY GROSS.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.250
BASICALLY TOLD ME EVERYTHING
WE'RE SERVING IS.

08:38.283 --> 08:39.718
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT HIM
TO SAY?

08:39.751 --> 08:41.019
EVERYTHING WAS GREAT?

08:41.053 --> 08:42.554
EVERY SINGLE DISH
HE HAD SUCKED.

08:42.588 --> 08:44.690
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HELP
BUT GET DEFENSIVE.

08:44.723 --> 08:46.859
RISOTTO.

08:46.892 --> 08:48.894
THE CHEF LIKES
ALL THIS LITTLE MACHE,

08:48.927 --> 08:50.262
LAMB'S LETTUCE.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.733
SADLY, IT'S HOT
AND DISGUSTING.

08:54.766 --> 08:57.202
THE RICE JUST...
PUREES IN YOUR MOUTH.

08:57.236 --> 09:00.000
IT LIKE SORTS OF STICKS
TO THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.939
IT LIKE SORTS OF STICKS
TO THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH.

09:00.973 --> 09:02.307
WHEN A RESTAURANT
CAN'T EVEN COOK

09:02.341 --> 09:03.575
A SIMPLE MUSHROOM RISOTTO,

09:03.609 --> 09:04.977
IT'S A BIG WORRY.

09:05.010 --> 09:07.713
GORDON DIDN'T LIKE
THE FOOD.

09:07.746 --> 09:09.448
DIDN'T SEEM
TO LIKE ANYTHING.

09:09.481 --> 09:11.884
SO NOBODY'S FEELING
TOO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

09:11.917 --> 09:13.685
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
A RESTAURATEUR,

09:13.719 --> 09:15.621
AT LEAST KNOW
WHAT YOUR FOOD TASTES LIKE.

09:15.654 --> 09:17.556
I DON'T THINK THIS GUY'S
GOT A  CLUE

09:17.589 --> 09:18.757
WHAT HIS FOOD TASTES LIKE.

09:18.790 --> 09:21.093
OKAY. TAKE A SEAT.

09:21.126 --> 09:22.394
SIT DOWN.
SURE.

09:22.427 --> 09:24.029
RIGHT. UM, THAT WAS
INTERESTING.

09:24.062 --> 09:26.431
UM, INTERESTING,
BUT BITTERLY DISAPPOINTING.

09:26.465 --> 09:27.699
IS THAT CANNED CRAB?

09:27.733 --> 09:28.967
THAT'S NOT FRESH
CRAB MEAT, IS IT?

09:29.001 --> 09:30.000
THAT'S CANNED CRAB.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.669
THAT'S CANNED CRAB.

09:30.702 --> 09:33.005
WHEN I ASKED VERY POLITELY
"IS THE CRAB MEAT FRESH?",

09:33.038 --> 09:35.174
THE WAITER TOLD ME,
"YES, OF COURSE IT IS."

09:35.207 --> 09:37.009
THE WAITER TOLD YOU
THAT WAS FRESH CRAB MEAT?

09:37.042 --> 09:38.010
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I ORDERED IT.

09:38.043 --> 09:38.977
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.145
FIRST ONE
WAS STONE COLD.

09:41.313 --> 09:44.483
HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THERE
AND EAT THAT FOR ME.

09:44.516 --> 09:46.552
LOOKING AT IT,

09:46.585 --> 09:49.788
IT LOOKED LIKE IT'D COME OUT
OF A BABY'S DIAPER, HUH?

09:49.821 --> 09:52.457
NO ONE'S GONNA COME BACK
FOR THAT.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.626
THAT IS A CHOPPED SALAD.
I MEAN, IT'S HIDEOUS.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.396
HAVE A TASTE OF THAT.

09:57.429 --> 09:59.798
MY EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
COULD COOK BETTER THAN THAT.

09:59.831 --> 10:00.000
PROBABLY FROM ANYONE ELSE,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.200
PROBABLY FROM ANYONE ELSE,

10:01.233 --> 10:02.434
I WOULD'VE
THREW THE TABLE OVER

10:02.467 --> 10:04.570
AND THREW THEM OUT.

10:04.603 --> 10:06.405
HONESTLY, YOUR FOOD'S CRAP.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.410
HE'S A LITTLE HARSH.

10:11.443 --> 10:13.946
AND HE GOT TO BE A LITTLE
ABUSIVE ON THE FOOD.

10:15.113 --> 10:16.582
OH.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.984
WHAT THE HELL
DID WE GET INTO?

10:19.017 --> 10:21.486
IF YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE

10:21.520 --> 10:24.623
RUNNING THIS BUSINESS
SERVING THAT ,

10:24.656 --> 10:26.458
YOU MAY AS WELL
TURN THIS PLACE INTO A MUSEUM.

10:26.491 --> 10:27.659
NO ONE'S GONNA COME BACK
FOR THIS.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.561
I WAS PISSED.

10:29.595 --> 10:30.000
REAL PISSED.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.963
REAL PISSED.

10:30.996 --> 10:32.531
I WANTED TO TAKE THE PLATE

10:32.564 --> 10:34.399
AND SMASH IT ON TOP
OF THE CHEF'S HEAD.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.774
COMING UP, GORDON BURSTS
DEAN'S BUBBLE.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.611
I'M NOT TOO SURE
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY HUNGRY

10:45.644 --> 10:46.845
FOR THE CHANGE.

10:46.878 --> 10:48.614
THIS OWNER BOILS OVER.

10:48.647 --> 10:51.083
GET PAID TO DO IS STAND HERE
NEXT TO PEOPLE

10:51.116 --> 10:53.051
AND GIVE THEM A GOOD
EXPERIENCE.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.454
AND LATER, MICHAEL SNAPS.

10:55.487 --> 10:57.489
IT'S BEEN AN HOUR
AND I GOT NOTHING.

10:57.522 --> 10:59.558
THIS IS THE COPY.
YOU GOTTA HAVE THE OTHER HALF.

10:59.591 --> 11:00.000
THIS GOES FROM THE SALAD.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.926
THIS GOES FROM THE SALAD.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.461
THAT'S COMING UP

11:02.494 --> 11:03.662
ONKITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

11:09.033 --> 11:11.435
IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND
ALL THE ISSUES

11:11.469 --> 11:13.437
OF THE OLDE STONE MILL,

11:13.471 --> 11:15.873
IT'S TIME TO GET TIGHT-LIPPED
DEAN TO OPEN UP.

11:15.907 --> 11:18.309
UM, THESE QUESTIONS
MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE, DEAN,

11:18.342 --> 11:21.779
BUT UNLESS I UNDERSTAND
THE FULL SCENARIO,

11:21.813 --> 11:24.015
THEN I CAN'T GET THIS PLACE
BACK ON LINE.

11:24.048 --> 11:26.150
ONE THING I'D LIKE TO KNOW

11:26.184 --> 11:28.519
IS THE FINANCIAL...

11:28.553 --> 11:30.121
SITUATION.

11:30.154 --> 11:33.958
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE CURRENT
FINANCIAL SITUATION, BARBARA?

11:33.991 --> 11:35.565
UM, HE KIND OF KEEPS ME
IN THE DARK A LITTLE BIT.

11:35.565 --> 11:36.961
UM, HE KIND OF KEEPS ME
IN THE DARK A LITTLE BIT.

11:36.994 --> 11:38.763
I DON'T WANT HER
TO WORRY.

11:38.796 --> 11:40.498
THERE'S NO REASON FOR HER
TO SHARE

11:40.531 --> 11:42.667
THESE ANXIETY AND NERVES
THAT I HAVE.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.468
TOTALLY UNNECESSARY.

11:46.871 --> 11:48.306
I TRY NOT TO BRING IT UP.

11:50.908 --> 11:52.743
IT'S ALWAYS EASIER
JUST TO KINDA

11:52.777 --> 11:54.478
NOT THINK ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

11:54.512 --> 11:56.414
AND THAT'S PROBABLY
ONE OF THE REASONS

11:56.447 --> 11:59.483
WHY I DON'T COME DOWN VERY OFTEN
TO THE RESTAURANT.

11:59.517 --> 12:02.553
BECAUSE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW
CAN'T HURT YOU.

12:02.587 --> 12:04.555
I JUST CHOOSE NOT TO DEAL
WITH IT RIGHT NOW.

12:04.589 --> 12:05.565
I LET HIM DEAL WITH IT.

12:05.565 --> 12:06.457
I LET HIM DEAL WITH IT.

12:09.894 --> 12:11.796
I MEAN, THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
YOU'RE LOSING MONEY.

12:11.829 --> 12:12.930
CORRECT. EVERY WEEK.

12:12.964 --> 12:14.665
EVERY WEEK.
YES.

12:14.699 --> 12:19.770
IF WE HAD
TO CLOSE TONIGHT...

12:19.804 --> 12:21.205
JUST SWITCH EVERYTHING OFF,

12:21.239 --> 12:23.107
WHAT WOULD WE OWE?

12:26.444 --> 12:28.646
HALF A MILLION.
HALF A MILLION.

12:28.679 --> 12:30.748
YEAH.

12:30.781 --> 12:32.817
IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD
FOR OUR MARRIAGE,

12:32.850 --> 12:34.919
I DON'T THINK, IF HE WOULD RISK,
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING

12:34.952 --> 12:35.565
THAT WE POSSIBLY HAD
IN THE WORLD.

12:35.565 --> 12:36.554
THAT WE POSSIBLY HAD
IN THE WORLD.

12:36.587 --> 12:40.258
GOT MONEY TIED UP
IN THE HOME?

12:40.291 --> 12:42.260
OH YEAH. OH SURE.
MORTGAGE-WISE?

12:42.293 --> 12:43.895
A MORTGAGE.
A SECOND MORTGAGE.

12:43.928 --> 12:45.296
AND A HOME EQUITY LINE.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.564
GOD. SO THAT'S BACKED UP
BIG TIME.

12:46.597 --> 12:47.832
YEAH.

12:47.865 --> 12:49.834
HOW DO YOU MANAGE
IN TERMS

12:49.867 --> 12:51.836
OF GETTING THROUGH
MONTH TO MONTH IN TERMS

12:51.869 --> 12:54.005
OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS,
SUPPLIES,

12:54.038 --> 12:55.506
SALARIES, YOUR SALARY?

12:55.539 --> 12:57.074
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

12:57.108 --> 12:58.476
IT'S--IT'S--YOU KNOW,
I'M IN HELL RIGHT NOW.

13:00.578 --> 13:02.446
PLEASE DON'T GET UPSET.
I KNOW. I WON'T.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.915
NO, IT'S JUST--

13:03.948 --> 13:05.549
IT'S CRUCIAL FOR ME
TO UNDERSTAND

13:05.583 --> 13:06.918
EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE.
NO, I KNOW.

13:06.951 --> 13:08.953
I'VE GOTTA BE
REALLY FRANK AND HONEST.

13:18.429 --> 13:20.398
NOTHING IS MORE TELLING
TO GORDON

13:20.431 --> 13:22.199
THAN OBSERVING A FULL
DINNER SERVICE.

13:22.233 --> 13:24.068
FORTUNATELY,
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT,

13:24.101 --> 13:26.537
THE ONE NIGHT THE RESTAURANT
IS BUSY.

13:26.570 --> 13:27.638
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

13:27.672 --> 13:29.040
WELL, ENJOY YOUR DINNER.

13:29.073 --> 13:30.474
HI, FOLKS.
HOW ARE YOU?

13:30.508 --> 13:31.676
I KNOW YOU'LL BE HAPPY
WITH THAT.

13:31.709 --> 13:32.977
AND CAN'T GO WRONG.

13:33.010 --> 13:34.779
TONIGHT, I'M ON THE EDGE

13:34.812 --> 13:35.565
'CAUSE NOW THE FEAR OF FAILURE'S
SETTING IN.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.214
'CAUSE NOW THE FEAR OF FAILURE'S
SETTING IN.

13:41.419 --> 13:42.920
AS ORDERS BEGIN TO ARRIVE

13:42.954 --> 13:44.555
IN THE KITCHEN...

13:44.588 --> 13:46.290
FRIED CALAMARI.
CHOPPED SALAD.

13:46.324 --> 13:48.059
CRAB CAKES.
ONE PRIME RIB, MEDIUM RARE.

13:48.092 --> 13:49.760
TWO CASHEW CHICKEN.

13:49.794 --> 13:51.996
CHEF MICHAEL
IS CLEARLY FRUSTRATED.

13:52.029 --> 13:53.798
YOU SEE ANYBODY RUN A LINE
BY THEMSELVES BEFORE?

13:53.831 --> 13:56.133
NOT LIKE THIS BEFORE, NO.

13:56.167 --> 13:58.135
IT'S JUST ME
AND YOU HAVE TO GET IT DONE.

13:58.169 --> 13:59.637
YOU GET IT DONE.

14:03.074 --> 14:05.309
MICHAEL WORKS MORE
THAN IS EXPECTED

14:05.343 --> 14:05.565
OF A NORMAL CHEF.

14:05.565 --> 14:06.410
OF A NORMAL CHEF.

14:06.444 --> 14:08.446
HE DOES ABOVE AND BEYOND.

14:08.479 --> 14:10.481
AS CHEF MICHAEL CONTINUES
TO FIGHT THE BATTLES ALONE

14:10.514 --> 14:11.949
IN THE KITCHEN...

14:11.983 --> 14:13.451
NICE TO MEET YOU, LISA.

14:13.484 --> 14:15.052
OWNER DEAN AND MANAGER TOM

14:15.086 --> 14:16.587
ARE IN THEIR OWN WORLD
IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

14:19.223 --> 14:21.058
HI, HOW ARE YOU?
PERFECT.

14:21.092 --> 14:22.727
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
A BEER WITH YOU.
OH, REALLY?

14:22.760 --> 14:23.761
CHEERS.
CHEERS.

14:25.062 --> 14:26.364
SAY THE TRUTH.

14:26.397 --> 14:27.865
THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE THIS
IN PENNSYLVANIA.

14:27.898 --> 14:29.800
THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE HOME.

14:32.003 --> 14:34.038
AS THE MANAGER HERE,
I DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

14:34.071 --> 14:35.565
TO KEEP THE PLACE RUNNING
AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE.

14:35.565 --> 14:36.741
TO KEEP THE PLACE RUNNING
AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE.

14:49.553 --> 14:51.655
AN HOUR INTO DINNER SERVICE

14:51.689 --> 14:54.125
AND THE OVERLY
EMBELLISHED DISHES

14:54.158 --> 14:56.827
FINALLY EMERGE
FROM THE KITCHEN.

14:56.861 --> 15:00.097
MIKE TRIES TO PRESENTATE
THE FOOD REAL NICE.

15:00.131 --> 15:01.799
WHAT'S THIS CRACK HERE
WITH CALAMARI

15:01.832 --> 15:03.134
IN A MARTINI GLASS?

15:03.167 --> 15:04.668
THEY'RE JUST TRYING
DIFFERENT PRESENTATION

15:04.702 --> 15:05.565
BECAUSE THE DISHES
WE HAVE SUCK.

15:05.565 --> 15:09.707
BECAUSE THE DISHES
WE HAVE SUCK.

15:09.740 --> 15:12.209
SUCK? I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D BE SO  POLITE.

15:13.677 --> 15:16.080
HOLY MACKEREL.

15:16.113 --> 15:18.149
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

15:18.182 --> 15:20.518
AND NEITHER GORDON
OR THE CUSTOMERS

15:20.551 --> 15:21.752
ARE IMPRESSED.

15:25.089 --> 15:26.957
IS IT COLD?

15:26.991 --> 15:28.626
IS THERE ENOUGH SAUCE
ON THESE CASHEW CHICKENS?

15:28.659 --> 15:30.961
YES, THERE IS.

15:30.995 --> 15:33.130
WHEN IT JUST BECOMES A JOB.

15:33.164 --> 15:34.532
NOT THAT YOU DON'T CARE,

15:34.565 --> 15:35.565
NOT THAT YOU DON'T PUT
ANY EFFORT,

15:35.565 --> 15:36.100
NOT THAT YOU DON'T PUT
ANY EFFORT,

15:36.133 --> 15:37.401
BUT IT'S JUST THE SAME
EVERY DAY.

15:37.435 --> 15:39.804
BY THE WAY,
THE PAPER'S EDIBLE.

15:39.837 --> 15:42.406
I'VE NEVER HAD MY DINNER
SERVED TO ME

15:42.440 --> 15:43.707
IN A BROWN PAPER BAGGY.

15:47.344 --> 15:48.846
IN YOUR BUSINESS
RIGHT NOW,

15:48.879 --> 15:50.247
I WISH THAT WAS
THE ONLY PROBLEM,

15:50.281 --> 15:52.316
A  FRENCH FRY.

16:01.058 --> 16:04.228
WITH FOOD NOW BEING SENT
BACK TO THE KITCHEN,

16:04.261 --> 16:05.565
ALREADY BEHIND, MICHAEL IS NOW
TOTALLY OVERWHELMED.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.331
ALREADY BEHIND, MICHAEL IS NOW
TOTALLY OVERWHELMED.

16:07.364 --> 16:09.533
I NEED A RISOTTO AND A TILAPIA
AND THAT'S DONE.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.202
AND DEAN IS NOT HELPING
THE PROBLEMS,

16:11.235 --> 16:12.770
BUT ADDING TO THEM.

16:12.803 --> 16:15.573
I GOT BACKED UP 'CAUSE IT WAS
TOO MUCH AT ONCE.

16:15.606 --> 16:16.841
OH MY GOD.
OVERCOOKED.

16:16.874 --> 16:18.008
COME ON. COME ON.

16:21.212 --> 16:23.848
- IT'S OVERCOOKED.
- DAMN IT.

16:23.881 --> 16:25.516
GOT ME VERY FRUSTRATED.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.984
WE LET THE CUSTOMER WAIT.

16:27.017 --> 16:28.752
IF HE WAITS 20 MINUTES
AND HE'S HAPPY

16:28.786 --> 16:33.057
OR HE WAITS 20 MINUTES,
GETS CRAP, WHAT'S WORSE?

16:33.090 --> 16:35.092
PLEASE SEND IT OUT
RIGHT NOW.

16:35.126 --> 16:35.565
MICHAEL.
YES, SIR.

16:35.565 --> 16:36.460
MICHAEL.
YES, SIR.

16:36.494 --> 16:37.828
ARE YOU HAPPY
WITH THAT RISOTTO?

16:37.862 --> 16:39.630
NOT REALLY, CHEF.
NO.

16:39.663 --> 16:41.198
MICHAEL, IF YOU'RE
NOT HAPPY WITH IT,

16:41.232 --> 16:42.533
WHY'D YOU SERVE IT,
MY MAN?

16:42.566 --> 16:44.101
CHEF TO CHEF NOW.
WHY?

16:44.135 --> 16:45.769
FORGET--FORGET--FORGET DEAN
FOR A SECOND.

16:45.803 --> 16:47.938
WHERE'S THE TILAPIA?

16:47.972 --> 16:49.507
IT'S IN THE OVEN.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.576
DEAN, HE'S THE OWNER.
ULTIMATELY, IT'S HIS DECISION.

16:52.610 --> 16:54.812
HEY.
YEAH.

17:14.498 --> 17:16.000
DOES IT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER

17:16.033 --> 17:17.301
IF WE RUSHED IT
TO THE TABLE?

17:17.334 --> 17:18.636
NO.

17:18.669 --> 17:20.704
I'M TRYING TO ASK
CHEF ABOUT SOME FORM OF STANDARD

17:20.738 --> 17:23.040
AND YOU'RE JUST SAYING
GET THE  FOOD

17:23.073 --> 17:24.742
OUT OF THERE.
BECAUSE THE LADY ASKED ME
THREE TIMES FOR HER FOOD.

17:24.775 --> 17:27.545
I'M AMAZED, YOU KNOW THAT,
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

17:27.578 --> 17:29.079
I DON'T KNOW--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT

17:29.113 --> 17:30.514
YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU.

17:34.118 --> 17:35.565
BUT IT'S DONE.
IT'S DONE, GORDON.

17:35.565 --> 17:35.686
BUT IT'S DONE.
IT'S DONE, GORDON.

17:35.719 --> 17:36.954
IT'S DONE.

17:36.987 --> 17:39.256
I LOVE THE FACADE
YOU PUT ACROSS IT.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.658
IT'S NOT A FACADE.
YES, IT IS.

17:40.691 --> 17:41.725
NO, IT'S NOT.

17:51.368 --> 17:53.304
THANK YOU.

18:06.450 --> 18:09.286
DEAN'S WILLINGNESS TO SEND OUT
SUB-STANDARD RISOTTO

18:09.320 --> 18:12.656
TYPIFIES WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE OLDE STONE MILL.

18:12.690 --> 18:15.392
IN ADDITION, A GREAT DEAL
OF DEAN'S ENERGY

18:15.426 --> 18:17.628
HAS GONE INTO BEAUTIFYING
THE RESTAURANT,

18:17.661 --> 18:21.065
BUT THE MENU
HAS BEEN NEGLECTED.

18:21.098 --> 18:25.469
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
THE REAL REASON WHY I'M HERE.

18:25.502 --> 18:28.138
THE INCONSISTENCY
OF THE FOOD IS OBVIOUS.

18:28.172 --> 18:30.608
THE FOOD NEEDS
SOME SERIOUS ATTENTION.

18:30.641 --> 18:34.078
AND YET NO ONE SEEMS
TO ADDRESS IT.

18:34.111 --> 18:35.565
I ASKED MICHAEL "ARE YOU HAPPY
WITH THE RISOTTO?"

18:35.565 --> 18:37.481
I ASKED MICHAEL "ARE YOU HAPPY
WITH THE RISOTTO?"

18:37.514 --> 18:38.916
HE SAID, "NO."

18:38.949 --> 18:40.784
AND YOU SAID, NO,
GOTTA SERVE, I GOTTA SERVE IT.

18:40.818 --> 18:42.720
THEY'VE BEEN WAITING
50 MINUTES.

18:42.753 --> 18:44.221
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
DAMAGE YOU'RE CAUSING?

18:44.255 --> 18:46.323
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

18:46.357 --> 18:47.791
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT I WANT.

18:47.825 --> 18:49.593
IT'S JUST WHAT I'M--
I'M MIFFED.

18:49.627 --> 18:51.695
I'M NOT TOO SURE
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY HUNGRY

18:51.729 --> 18:54.832
FOR THE CHANGE--
YOU KNOW THAT?

18:54.865 --> 18:56.934
IT'S ONE THING
TO BELIEVE IN A DREAM,

18:56.967 --> 18:59.803
BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING
TO ACTUALLY BE IN A DREAM WORLD.

18:59.837 --> 19:02.806
FOR EVERY PLATE OF FOOD
WE SEND,

19:02.840 --> 19:04.308
WE'RE NARROWING THE CHANCES

19:04.341 --> 19:05.565
OF THIS PLACE
BECOMING SUCCESSFUL.

19:05.565 --> 19:06.677
OF THIS PLACE
BECOMING SUCCESSFUL.

19:06.710 --> 19:10.481
AND I THINK YOU'VE BULLIED THEM
INTO MAKING SURE

19:10.514 --> 19:13.317
THAT THEY GET BRAINWASHED
TO HOW YOU THINK.

19:14.685 --> 19:16.420
BUT LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:16.453 --> 19:18.656
WHAT YOU THINK IS WRONG.

19:18.689 --> 19:21.158
IT'S TOUGH TO GET POKED AT
ALL DAY.

19:21.191 --> 19:23.294
I FEEL LIKE POKING BACK
RIGHT NOW.

19:24.628 --> 19:26.797
I'M TRYING TO GET THROUGH
TO YOU.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.465
'CAUSE IF I CAN'T
GET THROUGH TO YOU,

19:28.499 --> 19:30.467
I'VE GOT NO CHANCE.

19:30.501 --> 19:32.436
I THINK YOU'RE TREATING THIS
LIKE A GAME.

19:32.469 --> 19:34.371
HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME
OF NOT HAVING A COMMITMENT.

19:34.405 --> 19:35.565
DARE YOU? I DON'T DARE YOU.
I'M TELLING YOU.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.340
DARE YOU? I DON'T DARE YOU.
I'M TELLING YOU.

19:36.373 --> 19:38.142
YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME ANYTHING.

19:38.175 --> 19:39.476
THIS IS YOUR OWN FIGMENT
OF YOUR IMAGINATION

19:39.510 --> 19:40.911
THAT I DON'T HAVE A COMMITMENT
TO THIS PLACE.

19:40.944 --> 19:42.379
DEAN'S A FIGHTER.

19:42.413 --> 19:44.014
HE'S NOT GONNA BACK DOWN
FROM A CHALLENGE.

19:44.048 --> 19:45.282
YOU JUST GIVE ME
TWO MINUTES.

19:45.316 --> 19:46.383
YOU GUYS,
DO YOU MIND?

19:46.417 --> 19:48.018
YOU FLOAT ON THE CUSTOMERS

19:48.052 --> 19:49.520
COMING 'ROUND AND BLOWING SMOKE
UP YOUR.

19:49.553 --> 19:50.888
THAT'S RIGHT, I DO.

19:50.921 --> 19:52.656
WHEN I ASK PEOPLE
HOW THEIR FOOD IS

19:52.690 --> 19:54.491
AND THEY TELL ME IT'S GOOD,
IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

19:54.525 --> 19:56.093
I DON'T HOVER AROUND
MY CUSTOMERS KISSING--

19:56.126 --> 19:57.194
HOW WAS IT?
PLEASE TELL ME.

19:57.227 --> 19:58.462
YOU DON'T GO TO A TABLE

19:58.495 --> 19:59.930
ASK PEOPLE
HOW THEIR MEAL WAS?

19:59.963 --> 20:01.265
OH NO, YOU PROBABLY
PAY TEN PEOPLE.

20:01.298 --> 20:02.900
NO, I LISTEN TO THE PHONE
EVERY MORNING

20:02.933 --> 20:04.335
TO SEE HOW
FULLY BOOKED I AM.

20:04.368 --> 20:05.565
THIS IS WHAT I GET PAID
TO DO.

20:05.565 --> 20:05.803
THIS IS WHAT I GET PAID
TO DO.

20:05.836 --> 20:07.271
TO STAND IN HERE
AND WATCH PEOPLE.

20:07.304 --> 20:08.872
THAT'S WHAT I GET PAID
TO DO.

20:08.906 --> 20:10.407
TO STAND HERE NEXT TO PEOPLE
AND GIVE THEM

20:10.441 --> 20:11.642
A GOOD  EXPERIENCE.

20:11.675 --> 20:12.976
THAT'S WHAT I GET PAID FOR.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.712
AND WATCH THIS
COME OUT.

20:14.745 --> 20:16.547
NO, THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
AND YOU FEEL GOOD
ABOUT IT.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.182
NO, I DON'T FEEL GOOD
ABOUT IT.
THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

20:18.215 --> 20:19.683
- I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.
-  YOU  DO.

20:19.717 --> 20:20.818
IT'S WHAT I GOTTA DO.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

20:20.851 --> 20:21.919
YOU'RE A FAKE.

20:21.952 --> 20:24.321
YOU.
YOU'RE A FAKE.

20:24.355 --> 20:25.756
YOU'RE A  FAKE.

20:27.399 --> 20:27.956
IS THAT HOW YOU'RE
GONNA ACT?

20:27.956 --> 20:31.562
WALK AWAY? CAN YOU NOT FACE IT
LIKE A  MAN?

20:39.357 --> 20:41.259
IT'S WHAT I GOTTA DO.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

20:41.292 --> 20:42.360
YOU'RE A FAKE.

20:42.393 --> 20:44.829
YOU.
YOU'RE A FAKE.

20:44.862 --> 20:46.231
YOU'RE A  FAKE.

20:46.264 --> 20:47.966
OH, YOU'RE FULL OF

20:47.999 --> 20:49.801
IS THAT HOW YOU'RE
GONNA ACT?

20:49.834 --> 20:51.202
WALK AWAY? CAN YOU NOT FACE IT
LIKE A  MAN?

20:51.236 --> 20:53.004
I FACE EVERYTHING
LIKE A MAN.

20:53.037 --> 20:54.205
YOU DO.
I DON'T SHY AWAY
FROM NOTHING.

20:54.239 --> 20:55.373
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOTHING.

20:55.406 --> 20:58.910
NOTHING.
NOT YOU. NOTHING.

21:00.311 --> 21:02.146
I HAVE A COMMITMENT
TO THIS PLACE THAT YOU'LL

21:02.180 --> 21:02.647
PROBABLY NEVER HAVE
AT ANY PLACE

21:02.680 --> 21:03.381
IN YOUR LIFE EVER.

21:03.414 --> 21:04.682
WHAT?

21:04.716 --> 21:04.767
DID I STUTTER?

21:04.767 --> 21:06.851
DID I STUTTER?

21:06.884 --> 21:08.853
I JUST TOLD YOU
HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS PLACE.

21:08.886 --> 21:10.488
I'M NOT GONNA
TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE ME.

21:10.521 --> 21:11.923
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

21:11.956 --> 21:13.524
YOU DON'T LIKE THE TRUTH,
DO YOU?

21:13.558 --> 21:15.426
NO ONE'S TOLD YOU.
NO, I DO LIKE THE TRUTH.

21:15.460 --> 21:17.128
I HEAR THE TRUTH--
NO ONE'S BURST
THIS ing BUBBLE.

21:17.161 --> 21:18.396
OF MY LIFE MORE THAN YOU'LL
EVER HEAR THE TRUTH.

21:18.429 --> 21:20.398
THAT'S.
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

21:20.431 --> 21:21.766
YOU TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR HAIR,
YOUR TROUSERS, YOUR SHIRT.

21:21.799 --> 21:23.434
YOU'RE WELL GROOMED.

21:23.468 --> 21:25.069
I JUST WANT YOU
TO TAKE PRIDE

21:25.103 --> 21:26.604
IN WHAT THE
YOU DO IN A BUSINESS.

21:26.638 --> 21:27.805
AND IF YOU APPLY
WHAT YOU'VE APPLIED TO YOURSELF

21:27.839 --> 21:29.274
EACH AND EVERY DAY,

21:29.307 --> 21:31.009
YOU WON'T BE SERVING
THAT.

21:31.042 --> 21:33.811
RIGHT NOW, WE GOT
SOME ISSUES IN HERE.

21:33.845 --> 21:34.767
AND UNLESS YOU'RE PREPARED
TO CHANGE,

21:34.767 --> 21:35.847
AND UNLESS YOU'RE PREPARED
TO CHANGE,

21:35.880 --> 21:38.816
THIS PLACE
HAS GOT NO CHANCE.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.251
AND YOU'VE HAD IT ALL
YOUR OWN  WAY

21:40.285 --> 21:42.487
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.156
AND IT'S NOT GONNA CONTINUE
BEING LIKE THAT.

21:47.425 --> 21:49.527
ONE THING HAS
TO CHANGE INSTANTLY...

21:49.560 --> 21:50.795
YOU.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.903
IRONICALLY, IT'S DEAN'S FEAR
OF FAILURE

21:58.936 --> 22:00.538
THAT IS PREVENTING HIM
FROM MAKING

22:00.571 --> 22:03.841
THE NECESSARY CHANGES
FOR SUCCESS.

22:03.875 --> 22:04.767
BUT BEFORE GORDON CAN PUT
HIS PLAN FOR CHANGE

22:04.767 --> 22:05.476
BUT BEFORE GORDON CAN PUT
HIS PLAN FOR CHANGE

22:05.510 --> 22:07.312
INTO ACTION,

22:07.345 --> 22:09.380
HE DECIDES TO EXPLORE
THE LOCAL COMPETITION.

22:09.414 --> 22:10.848
ITALIAN.

22:10.882 --> 22:12.483
CHINESE RESTAURANT.

22:12.517 --> 22:14.786
NEXT DOOR TO A PIZZERIA.

22:14.819 --> 22:16.988
AN AMERICAN BISTRO.

22:17.021 --> 22:19.057
NOW WAIT. ANOTHER ITALIAN.

22:19.090 --> 22:21.225
RESTAURANTS EVERYWHERE.

22:21.259 --> 22:23.461
ANOTHER ITALIAN.

22:27.598 --> 22:28.599
HOW ARE YOU?

22:28.633 --> 22:30.301
VERY GOOD.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

22:30.335 --> 22:31.869
YOU TOO.
AND WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
LITTLE SHOP.

22:31.903 --> 22:32.704
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BUSY LITTLE PLACE?

22:32.737 --> 22:34.105
VERY BUSY.
FANTASTIC.

22:34.138 --> 22:34.767
SO THEY'RE GREAT
MEAT EATERS HERE.

22:34.767 --> 22:35.673
SO THEY'RE GREAT
MEAT EATERS HERE.

22:35.707 --> 22:37.175
YES, THEY ARE.
THEY LOVE THEIR STEAKS.

22:37.208 --> 22:39.077
AND THEY LIKE 'EM THICK.
BEEN UP AND DOWN THE STREET.

22:39.110 --> 22:40.645
THERE'S NOT ONE STEAK HOUSE
ANYWHERE.

22:40.678 --> 22:41.946
NO, THERE ISN'T.

22:41.979 --> 22:43.214
WHY HAS NO ONE
EVER OPENED ONE HERE?

22:43.247 --> 22:44.649
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

22:44.682 --> 22:46.050
BUT IF THERE WAS
A STEAK HOUSE LOCALLY,

22:46.084 --> 22:47.085
YOU COULD SUPPLY IT.

22:47.118 --> 22:49.020
IT WOULD BE
A PLEASANT CHANGE.

22:49.053 --> 22:50.588
WELL, LISTEN.
THANK YOU.

22:50.621 --> 22:51.689
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.

22:51.723 --> 22:52.990
CHEF--CHEF,
THANK YOU AGAIN.

22:53.024 --> 22:54.092
TAKE CARE.
OKAY.

23:00.264 --> 23:02.300
NOW ARMED WITH LOCAL KNOWLEDGE,

23:02.333 --> 23:04.767
GORDON KNOWS THAT TO TURN
THIS RESTAURANT AROUND,

23:04.767 --> 23:05.236
GORDON KNOWS THAT TO TURN
THIS RESTAURANT AROUND,

23:05.269 --> 23:07.739
HE MUST GET THE CHEF
BACK ON TRACK.

23:07.772 --> 23:10.775
MICHAEL, THIS RESTAURANT
NEEDS TO BE KNOWN FOR SOMETHING.

23:12.143 --> 23:14.078
FIRST BIG CHANGE.

23:14.112 --> 23:15.246
PRIME RIB.
PRIME RIB.

23:15.279 --> 23:16.948
ON THE BONE.
OKAY.

23:16.981 --> 23:19.317
THIS IS A SPECIAL
TO GET THIS PLACE

23:19.350 --> 23:20.952
IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION.
OKAY.

23:20.985 --> 23:22.286
TO MAKE
YOUR LIFE EASIER,

23:22.320 --> 23:23.855
AND TO MAKE SERVICE
QUICKER.

23:23.888 --> 23:25.256
I AM VERY NERVOUS.

23:25.289 --> 23:26.691
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
THAT YOU GET TO COOK

23:26.724 --> 23:27.825
WITH A WORLD-CLASS CHEF.

23:27.859 --> 23:29.193
YOU KNOW HOW TO SLICE IT
FROM THERE, DON'T YOU?

23:29.227 --> 23:31.329
DOWN AND ALL UP.
YEAH. EXACTLY.

23:31.362 --> 23:33.030
GO AHEAD AND PUT
THAT BEEF IN, YEAH?

23:33.064 --> 23:34.565
I'M EXCITED TO LEARN
THOSE NEW DISHES

23:34.599 --> 23:34.767
AND THEN AFTER TIME
JUST PUT MY OWN SPIN ON 'EM

23:34.767 --> 23:37.668
AND THEN AFTER TIME
JUST PUT MY OWN SPIN ON 'EM

23:37.702 --> 23:39.137
AND HOPE
HE DOESN'T COME BACK

23:39.170 --> 23:40.338
AND THROW ME UNDER
THE BUS.

23:40.371 --> 23:41.406
THE IDEA
BEHIND A CHOPPED SALAD

23:41.439 --> 23:42.507
IS HAVING THAT LITTLE BIT

23:42.540 --> 23:43.641
OF CRUNCH THERE, YEAH?

23:43.674 --> 23:45.209
ROMAINE. SHREDDED.

23:45.243 --> 23:47.145
A FEW CHIVES.
LITTLE BIT OF BACON IN THERE.

23:47.178 --> 23:49.080
HALF DRESS SO IT STAYS
NICE AND CRUNCHY.

23:49.113 --> 23:50.782
LITTLE SEASONING
ON THE AVOCADO.

23:50.815 --> 23:52.216
YOUR TOMATO.
CHOPPED EGG. A FEW CHIVES.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.418
YEAH.

23:55.586 --> 23:57.688
WEE. MELTDOWN.

23:57.722 --> 24:00.158
OKAY? YES?

24:00.191 --> 24:02.026
OH, JUST THINK
OF THE COMPLAINTS.

24:02.059 --> 24:03.694
WHAT? YOU'RE NOT STUFFING
MY SALAD IN A FUNNEL?

24:03.728 --> 24:04.767
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE NOT SERVING ME

24:04.767 --> 24:05.029
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE NOT SERVING ME

24:05.062 --> 24:06.164
A FUNNEL SALAD?

24:06.197 --> 24:08.032
MIKE, YOU ALL RIGHT
WITH THIS?

24:08.065 --> 24:09.600
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

24:09.634 --> 24:10.802
I LAUGHED MY ASS OFF.

24:10.835 --> 24:12.236
WHEN HE BURNED THOSE FUNNELS

24:12.270 --> 24:13.438
WITH THE CREME BRULEE TORCH,
I LAUGHED.

24:13.471 --> 24:14.806
AND I UNDERSTOOD HIS POINT.

24:14.839 --> 24:16.674
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH A SIMPLE SALAD.

24:16.707 --> 24:18.276
DON'T TRY AND MAKE IT
ANYTHING THAT IT'S NOT.

24:18.309 --> 24:21.112
IF THEY COME AND ASK ME
FOR THEIR SALAD

24:21.145 --> 24:22.780
TO BE STUCK
INSIDE A FUNNEL,

24:22.814 --> 24:24.649
I WILL PERSONALLY LIFT THEM

24:24.682 --> 24:26.684
AND PUT THEM NEXT DOOR
IN THE RETIREMENT HOME.

24:26.717 --> 24:28.152
OKAY?

24:28.186 --> 24:29.720
LAST OF THE  FUNNEL.

24:31.155 --> 24:33.558
WITH THE CHEF RE-ENERGIZED,

24:33.591 --> 24:34.767
GORDON TURNS HIS ATTENTION
TO THE OWNER AND HIS TEAM.

24:34.767 --> 24:36.794
GORDON TURNS HIS ATTENTION
TO THE OWNER AND HIS TEAM.

24:36.828 --> 24:39.831
DEAN HAS ALWAYS HAD
THE DESIRE TO SUCCEED.

24:39.864 --> 24:42.500
NOW CHEF RAMSAY IS ABOUT
TO TELL HIM HOW TO DO IT.

24:42.533 --> 24:44.569
OKAY, I'VE DONE
MY HOMEWORK.

24:44.602 --> 24:46.304
I'VE BEEN OUT AND ABOUT
AND I'VE.

24:46.337 --> 24:47.805
I'VE STUDIED HARD.

24:47.839 --> 24:49.574
WHAT ISN'T IN THE TOWN?

24:53.711 --> 24:55.179
THERE'S NOT ONE GOOD
STEAK HOUSE

24:55.213 --> 24:57.014
ANYWHERE IN THIS TOWN.

24:58.049 --> 25:00.885
THIS PLACE HAS GOT
EVERY CHANCE

25:00.918 --> 25:03.521
OF BECOMING A PHENOMENAL
STEAK HOUSE.

25:03.554 --> 25:04.767
CHEF GORDON'S IDEA
OF A STEAK HOUSE

25:04.767 --> 25:05.590
CHEF GORDON'S IDEA
OF A STEAK HOUSE

25:05.623 --> 25:07.358
WOULD REALLY WORK HERE.

25:07.391 --> 25:09.861
HE'S 100% RIGHT THAT THERE IS
NOTHING ELSE IN THE AREA.

25:09.894 --> 25:11.596
GIVE THE LOCALS
WHAT THEY WANT

25:11.629 --> 25:14.432
AND GET THEM COMING
TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

25:14.465 --> 25:16.267
AND MAKE MONEY!

25:16.300 --> 25:17.768
I'M LISTENING TO GORDON.

25:17.802 --> 25:19.136
I'M LISTENING TO EVERYTHING
HE SAID.

25:19.170 --> 25:20.638
AND HE'S MAKING
ALL THESE CHANGES.

25:20.671 --> 25:22.340
BUT WHEN THE CHANGES
ARE DONE,

25:22.373 --> 25:24.041
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GONNA
GET PEOPLE

25:24.075 --> 25:25.376
THROUGH THE DOOR.

25:25.409 --> 25:28.012
THIS PLACE OOZES STEAK HOUSE.

25:28.045 --> 25:29.680
I CANNOT TELL YOU.

25:29.714 --> 25:32.383
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

25:33.951 --> 25:34.767
HOW DO YOU SIT?

25:34.767 --> 25:35.786
HOW DO YOU SIT?

25:37.989 --> 25:39.757
I CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE
MANY CHANGES

25:39.790 --> 25:41.492
'CAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD
TO ALIENATE OR LOSE

25:41.526 --> 25:43.160
WHAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW.

25:43.194 --> 25:45.062
I'M FUMING.

25:45.096 --> 25:46.330
DEAN.

25:46.364 --> 25:47.565
GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT
OF MANHOOD.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.001
I'M NOT INSANE.

25:50.034 --> 25:52.203
I HAD A VISION.

25:52.236 --> 25:55.773
YOU COOKED A SIMPLE
PRIME RIB.

25:55.806 --> 25:57.241
THAT WAS YOUR RESURRECTION
OF THE PLACE

25:57.275 --> 25:58.442
WAS A SIMPLE PRIME RIB?

25:58.476 --> 26:01.078
HEY, I'VE GOT TWELVE
SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANTS,

26:01.112 --> 26:02.847
HIGHLY PROFITABLE,

26:02.880 --> 26:04.549
AND YOU, MY MAN, MISSED OUT
ON THE  TRUTH.

26:04.582 --> 26:04.767
WHEN YOU CHANGE CONCEPTS...

26:04.767 --> 26:07.051
WHEN YOU CHANGE CONCEPTS...

26:07.084 --> 26:10.288
WHEN YOU CHANGE DIRECTIONS
SO RADICALLY,

26:10.321 --> 26:12.089
I THINK THAT'S A SIGN
OF WEAKNESS.

26:13.791 --> 26:15.393
TOMORROW, WE'RE CHANGING
THE MENU.

26:15.426 --> 26:16.928
WE'RE GONNA RELAUNCH
THE RESTAURANT.

26:16.961 --> 26:18.596
YOU'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS
THINKING TO DO.

26:19.139 --> 26:19.536
GOOD NIGHT.

26:31.607 --> 26:33.443
IT'S DAY FOUR, RELAUNCH DAY.

26:33.476 --> 26:35.278
AND TIME FOR DEAN
TO EMBRACE THE CHANGES

26:35.311 --> 26:37.680
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY SAVE
HIS RESTAURANT.

26:37.714 --> 26:39.983
GORDON SECRETLY HAS BROUGHT IN
HIS DESIGN TEAM,

26:40.016 --> 26:41.484
WHO WORKED
THROUGH THE NIGHT

26:41.517 --> 26:42.986
TO SPRUCE UP
THE OLDE STONE MILL.

26:43.019 --> 26:45.254
YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST
ARRIVED HERE, YEAH?

26:45.288 --> 26:47.190
I DROVE BY THIS BEAUTIFUL
BUILDING

26:47.223 --> 26:48.524
WITHOUT ACTUALLY REALIZING

26:48.558 --> 26:49.726
IT WAS A RESTAURANT.

26:53.162 --> 26:54.197
NO SIGN.

26:54.230 --> 26:55.264
NO.
NOTHING.

26:55.298 --> 26:56.933
LET'S HAVE A LOOK. YES?

26:56.966 --> 26:58.954
ONE, TWO, THREE.

26:58.954 --> 26:59.235
ONE, TWO, THREE.

26:59.268 --> 27:00.636
UP. LOOK AT IT.

27:00.670 --> 27:02.939
BEAUTIFUL.
NATURAL STONE.

27:02.972 --> 27:05.008
THE OLDE STONE MILL
STEAK HOUSE.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.175
NOW WE KNOW
WHAT THE PLACE IS

27:06.209 --> 27:07.110
WHEN WE DRIVE BY.

27:09.012 --> 27:10.413
WHEN THEY UNVEILED THE SIGN,

27:10.446 --> 27:12.448
IT WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY
BEAUTIFUL.

27:12.482 --> 27:13.783
I WAS BREATH-TAKEN.

27:13.816 --> 27:14.851
DEAN,
DO YOU LIKE IT?
I LOVE IT.

27:14.884 --> 27:15.918
HUH?
IT'S GREAT.

27:15.952 --> 27:16.919
VERY NICE.

27:16.953 --> 27:17.987
LOOK NEXT TO IT.

27:18.021 --> 27:19.188
STEAK HOUSE.

27:19.222 --> 27:22.191
WHY DIDN'T I GO
CALL THE SIGN GUY,

27:22.225 --> 27:23.893
WORK OUT A BARTER
WITH HIM,

27:23.926 --> 27:25.228
DO A TRADE, DO SOMETHING,
AND GET THE SIGN?

27:25.261 --> 27:26.829
I COULD HAVE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

27:26.863 --> 27:28.954
RIGHT, LET'S GO INSIDE.
THERE'S MORE.

27:28.954 --> 27:29.165
RIGHT, LET'S GO INSIDE.
THERE'S MORE.

27:29.198 --> 27:30.666
HISTORY.

27:30.700 --> 27:32.402
THIS IS ALL THE STUFF
THAT'S BEEN UPSTAIRS

27:32.435 --> 27:33.936
THAT YOU'VE
BEEN KEPT AWAY.

27:33.970 --> 27:35.505
SO WHEN CUSTOMERS
ARE WAITING,

27:35.538 --> 27:38.207
THEY CAN GET AN INSIGHT
TO WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.709
I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

27:39.742 --> 27:40.977
FROM THE FIRST MINUTE
THEY WALK IN HERE

27:41.010 --> 27:42.211
THAT YOUR HEART IS IN HERE.

27:42.245 --> 27:44.747
I WAS A LITTLE INTIMIDATED
WHEN I FIRST WALKED IN

27:44.781 --> 27:46.916
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT.

27:46.949 --> 27:49.519
EVERY NOOK, EVERY BLOODY
PIECE OF STONE.

27:49.552 --> 27:51.387
LOOK,
THE HISTORY'S THERE.
YEAH, MAN.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.022
GORDON PUTTING UP
THESE PICTURES

27:53.056 --> 27:54.057
OF ME BUILDING THE PLACE
BLEW ME AWAY.

27:54.090 --> 27:56.626
OKAY. THERE'S MORE.
COME THROUGH.

27:56.659 --> 27:58.861
BEAUTIFUL.

27:58.895 --> 27:58.954
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

27:58.954 --> 28:00.897
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.899
OH MY GOODNESS.

28:05.868 --> 28:08.938
WOW. NOW EVERYBODY
CAN SEE EVERYBODY.

28:08.971 --> 28:10.940
- WOW.
- OH, IT'S LOVELY.

28:10.973 --> 28:13.810
IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.
I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS.

28:13.843 --> 28:15.745
IT'S OPEN.
IT'S CLASSIC.

28:15.778 --> 28:18.848
WE'VE GOT NEW PLATES,
NEW LINEN, NEW TABLEWARE.

28:18.881 --> 28:20.316
BARBARA,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:20.349 --> 28:21.551
I GOT RID
OF THE DARK COLORS.

28:21.584 --> 28:24.420
TOO DEPRESSING.
TOO DEPRESSING.

28:24.454 --> 28:25.955
THE CANDLES
ON ALL THE TABLES.

28:25.988 --> 28:27.623
THE FRESH FLOWERS.

28:27.657 --> 28:28.954
IT'S JUST BRIGHT.
IT'S CHEERY.

28:28.954 --> 28:30.293
IT'S JUST BRIGHT.
IT'S CHEERY.

28:30.326 --> 28:31.427
IT'S A PLACE
YOU WANT TO BE.

28:31.461 --> 28:33.796
I'M SPEECHLESS.

28:33.830 --> 28:35.031
I'M SPEECHLESS.

28:35.064 --> 28:37.333
THE SAME RESTAURANT.

28:37.366 --> 28:38.968
THE SAME PEOPLE.

28:39.001 --> 28:40.570
BUT SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT.

28:40.603 --> 28:44.040
WE HAVE
GORDON RAMSAY'S TOUCH.

28:44.073 --> 28:45.308
SMELL.

28:45.341 --> 28:47.443
MM. MM.

28:47.477 --> 28:48.478
LET'S SEE IF IT WORKS.

28:48.511 --> 28:49.645
IT HAS TO WORK.

28:49.679 --> 28:50.847
IT'S THERE NOW.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.049
THERE'S NO
EXCUSE.

28:53.082 --> 28:54.617
WE'VE GOT RID
OF THE CLUTTER.

28:54.650 --> 28:55.618
LOOK AT IT.
LOOKS GREAT.

28:55.651 --> 28:56.953
HUH?
LOOKS GREAT.

28:56.986 --> 28:58.154
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT.

28:58.187 --> 28:58.954
I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS

28:58.954 --> 28:59.555
I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS

28:59.589 --> 29:01.290
INVOLVED ANY KIND
OF A MAKEOVER OF ANY SORT.

29:01.324 --> 29:04.460
BUT, UM, I'M MAN ENOUGH
TO ADMIT THAT IT'S GREAT.

29:04.494 --> 29:07.730
EVEN THOUGH THE IMPROVEMENTS
TO THE DECOR

29:07.763 --> 29:09.499
ARE WELL-RECEIVED,

29:09.532 --> 29:11.400
THAT WAS AN EASY CHANGE
TO ACCEPT.

29:11.434 --> 29:13.269
NOW FOR THE HARD ONE.

29:13.302 --> 29:14.937
THE NEW STEAK HOUSE MENU.

29:14.971 --> 29:16.506
OKAY. LET'S, UH,
LET'S GO THROUGH THE FOOD

29:16.539 --> 29:17.306
VERY, VERY QUICKLY, YES?

29:17.340 --> 29:18.541
MENU.

29:18.574 --> 29:20.576
LET'S START OFF
WITH THE, UH, MEATS.

29:20.610 --> 29:22.278
THAT'S THE PORTERHOUSE
STEAK FOR TWO.

29:22.311 --> 29:24.080
GOT THE MOST AMAZING
RIB EYE.

29:24.113 --> 29:25.848
NEXT TO THAT, YOU'VE GOT
THE NEW YORK STRIP,

29:25.882 --> 29:27.950
THE MOST POPULAR STEAK
ACROSS AMERICA.

29:27.984 --> 29:28.954
I EXPECTED A BLEND

29:28.954 --> 29:29.418
I EXPECTED A BLEND

29:29.452 --> 29:31.587
OF THE OLD AND NEW.

29:31.621 --> 29:33.923
BUT CHANGING THE MENU COMPLETELY
SURPRISED ME THE MOST.

29:33.956 --> 29:35.525
HALIBUT HAS A REALLY NICE,

29:35.558 --> 29:36.959
SORT OF RUSTIC,

29:36.993 --> 29:38.161
MEATY FLAVOR.

29:38.194 --> 29:39.795
YEAH,
IT'S A VERY ROBUST FISH.

29:39.829 --> 29:41.397
BUT PAN SEARED,
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

29:41.430 --> 29:42.598
AND THEN THE CRISPY-SKIN
SALMON.

29:42.632 --> 29:44.066
SPAGHETTI SQUASH,
CONFIT SHALLOT.

29:44.100 --> 29:45.268
AND A REALLY NICE
CRISPY SKIN, YES?

29:45.301 --> 29:47.470
OKAY, THE APPETIZERS.

29:47.503 --> 29:49.539
STEAMED MUSSELS.
NICE BIG BOWL.

29:49.572 --> 29:51.040
AND THEN THE CREAMED CORN.

29:51.073 --> 29:52.508
EVERY STEAK HOUSE
ACROSS THE STATES

29:52.542 --> 29:53.342
HAS GOT CREAMED CORN
ON THERE.

29:53.376 --> 29:54.510
AND THEN MY FAVORITE,

29:54.544 --> 29:56.379
THE OLDE STONE MILL
CHOPPED SALAD.

29:56.412 --> 29:58.648
SADLY, NO FUNNEL.

29:58.681 --> 29:58.954
THIS IS GONNA BE A CHALLENGE.

29:58.954 --> 30:00.416
THIS IS GONNA BE A CHALLENGE.

30:00.449 --> 30:02.385
BUT, UH, IT'S VERY EXCITING
TO HAVE A NEW MENU.

30:02.418 --> 30:05.021
WITH TWO HOURS TO GO
BEFORE THE DOORS OPEN,

30:05.054 --> 30:07.423
GORDON WANTS TO MAKE SURE
THE RESTAURANT FEELS

30:07.456 --> 30:09.025
LIKE THE STEAK HOUSE
IN TOWN.

30:09.058 --> 30:11.961
AND BEFORE ANYONE
EATS ANY FOOD,

30:11.994 --> 30:13.863
IT WILL BE UP TO THE FRONT
OF THE HOUSE STAFF.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.031
THIS IS NOW A STEAK HOUSE.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.532
WE'RE GONNA CONFIRM IT.

30:16.566 --> 30:17.800
EACH AND EVERY TABLE
THAT ARRIVES THIS EVENING,

30:17.833 --> 30:18.935
A QUICK PRESENTATION.

30:18.968 --> 30:21.704
BINGO.
TOM, SELL IT TO ME.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.739
MY WORRIES ARE

30:23.773 --> 30:26.175
THAT THE FOOD'S CHANGED,
THE AESTHETICS HAVE CHANGED,

30:26.209 --> 30:28.644
BUT I STILL HAVE
MY DYSFUNCTIONAL STAFF.

30:28.678 --> 30:28.954
HELLO.

30:28.954 --> 30:29.845
HELLO.

30:29.879 --> 30:32.281
WELCOME TO THE OLDE STONE MILL
STEAK HOUSE.

30:32.315 --> 30:34.083
HERE ARE THE STEAKS
WE HAVE THIS EVENING.

30:34.116 --> 30:36.385
THIS IS OUR...

30:38.688 --> 30:41.757
OUR 21-DAY-AGED...

30:41.791 --> 30:43.459
ME.

30:43.492 --> 30:44.694
LET'S GO.

30:44.727 --> 30:47.196
WE HAVE A...

30:47.230 --> 30:49.031
I'M COMPLETELY OUT
OF MY COMFORT ZONE.

30:49.065 --> 30:51.234
YOU CAN'T EXPECT
TO WIN THE GOLD MEDAL

30:51.267 --> 30:52.335
IN A WEEK.

30:52.368 --> 30:55.738
AND ON THE TOP,
A KOBE STRIP.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.974
A KOBE STRIP.

30:58.007 --> 30:58.954
SOUNDS LIKE A
JAPANESE LAP DANCING BAR.

30:58.954 --> 31:00.243
SOUNDS LIKE A
JAPANESE LAP DANCING BAR.

31:00.276 --> 31:03.246
IT'S STILL THE SAME
MEDIOCRE CREW IN THERE.

31:06.749 --> 31:08.884
GORDON HAS INTRODUCED
A LOT OF CHANGES

31:08.918 --> 31:11.487
TO THE OLDE STONE MILL
IN JUST A FEW DAYS.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.456
AND WITH THEIR HEADS
STILL REELING,

31:13.489 --> 31:15.291
IT'S TIME FOR DEAN
AND HIS STAFF

31:15.324 --> 31:16.626
TO RISE TO THE OCCASION.

31:16.659 --> 31:18.394
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?

31:18.427 --> 31:20.062
WE'RE EXCITED
ABOUT TONIGHT.

31:20.096 --> 31:21.430
WE'RE HOPING
THIS GOES OVER WELL FOR US.

31:21.464 --> 31:23.165
CAN I TAKE YOUR COAT?

31:25.534 --> 31:27.103
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE NEW LOOK?

31:27.136 --> 31:28.537
GORGEOUS.
I LOVE IT.

31:28.571 --> 31:28.954
IT'S A NEW START.
I'M EXHAUSTED.

31:28.954 --> 31:30.006
IT'S A NEW START.
I'M EXHAUSTED.

31:30.039 --> 31:32.708
I'M EMACIATED.
I'M TIRED. I'M ANXIOUS.

31:36.612 --> 31:38.180
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS
GOING INTO IT.

31:38.214 --> 31:38.981
NOT KNOWING OUR MENU
AT ALL.

31:39.015 --> 31:40.816
ONLY SEEING IT MAYBE, UH,

31:40.850 --> 31:42.585
TWO HOURS BEFORE
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO START.

31:42.618 --> 31:44.553
NOT BEING READY
IS ALWAYS A FEAR.

31:44.587 --> 31:47.256
OKAY. THIS ISTHE BIG NIGHT.

31:47.290 --> 31:48.991
WE'VE PUT A PLAN
TOGETHER.

31:49.025 --> 31:51.661
AND NOW THEY HAVE
TO SERIOUSLY EXECUTE IT.

31:51.694 --> 31:53.195
KOBE BEEF, MEDIUM RARE.

31:53.229 --> 31:55.197
I-I-I'M STUCK.

31:55.231 --> 31:57.733
I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE ALL THE MENUS ARE.

31:57.767 --> 31:58.954
IF PEOPLE
DROP THE BALL TONIGHT,

31:58.954 --> 32:00.136
IF PEOPLE
DROP THE BALL TONIGHT,

32:00.169 --> 32:02.371
YOU WON'T SEE THEM HERE
TOMORROW.

32:09.506 --> 32:11.642
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT
OF THE BIG RELAUNCH.

32:11.675 --> 32:12.943
GORDON RAMSAY'S PLAN
FOR A STEAK HOUSE

32:12.977 --> 32:14.778
TO FILL THE VOID
IN THIS TOWN

32:14.812 --> 32:16.280
HAS GENERATED SOME BUZZ.

32:17.348 --> 32:19.016
AND THE RESTAURANT
IS FULLY BOOKED.

32:19.049 --> 32:20.484
NOW IT'S UP TO DEAN
AND HIS STAFF

32:20.517 --> 32:22.686
TO START BUILDING
A NEW REPUTATION

32:22.720 --> 32:24.355
FOR THE OLDE STONE MILL.

32:24.388 --> 32:26.590
EVERYBODY IS ON THEIR
TIPPY TOES.

32:26.624 --> 32:29.126
THE MAYOR. NOW WHERE
DOES THE BIG SHOT GO?

32:29.159 --> 32:31.028
TONIGHT WILL CERTAINLY
BE AN INDICATION

32:31.061 --> 32:34.498
OF THE PROBABILITY
OF SUCCESS FOR THIS PLACE.

32:34.531 --> 32:36.258
HELLO.
MR. MAYOR.

32:36.258 --> 32:37.134
HELLO.
MR. MAYOR.

32:37.167 --> 32:39.737
LONG TIME NO SEE.

32:39.770 --> 32:42.573
I WAS A LITTLE INTIMIDATED
WHEN HE FIRST WALKED IN

32:42.606 --> 32:44.575
BECAUSE HE'S IMPORTANT TO ME
TO BE HERE.

32:44.608 --> 32:46.377
TAKE YOUR COAT.
OH, THANKS.

32:46.410 --> 32:47.978
WHEN THIS PLACE IS FULL
AND THE MAYOR'S HERE,

32:48.012 --> 32:49.847
IF YOU'RE NOT READY, UM,

32:49.880 --> 32:51.115
I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD
YOU ARE.

32:51.148 --> 32:52.349
OH, COME ON.

32:52.383 --> 32:53.851
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

32:53.884 --> 32:55.986
MAYOR.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.757
WITH THE CUSTOMERS
AND SPECIAL GUESTS

32:59.790 --> 33:01.225
TAKING THEIR SEATS,

33:01.258 --> 33:02.893
THE SERVERS ARE BUSY
MAKING THEIR ROUNDS

33:02.926 --> 33:04.595
WITH THE NEW MENU.

33:05.596 --> 33:06.258
THE KOBE BEEF.
MEDIUM WELL.

33:06.258 --> 33:07.431
THE KOBE BEEF.
MEDIUM WELL.

33:09.833 --> 33:11.635
AND IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT THE PRESSURE

33:11.669 --> 33:13.871
OF THE RE-LAUNCH
IS ALREADY GETTING TO TOM.

33:13.904 --> 33:16.140
NEW YORK STRIP.
I'M SORRY. THE NEW YORK STRIP.

33:16.173 --> 33:18.275
THE RIB EYE.
AND OUR KOBE BEEF SPECIAL.

33:18.308 --> 33:20.544
OKAY.

33:23.213 --> 33:24.848
IT WAS CRAZY.

33:24.882 --> 33:26.817
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE SITUATION
IS CRAZY

33:26.850 --> 33:28.419
AND THE WHOLE NIGHT OBVIOUSLY
FROM THE BEGINNING

33:28.452 --> 33:29.720
IS GONNA BE CRAZY.

33:33.057 --> 33:34.024
GET SOME NAPKINS.

33:34.058 --> 33:35.759
ME.

33:35.793 --> 33:36.258
I'M DONE.
NO, TOM, YOU'RE NOT.

33:36.258 --> 33:37.828
I'M DONE.
NO, TOM, YOU'RE NOT.

33:37.861 --> 33:39.697
I'M  DONE.
NO, TOM.

33:41.665 --> 33:42.900
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH--

33:42.933 --> 33:44.468
THE CHANGE IS SO QUICK.

33:44.501 --> 33:46.136
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE READY
FOR IT.

33:51.875 --> 33:54.411
WHILE TOM TRIES
TO PULL HIMSELF TOGETHER...

33:56.313 --> 33:58.282
AND COME BACK
AS THE  MANAGER, TOM.

33:58.315 --> 33:59.616
OKAY.
OKAY?

34:01.452 --> 34:03.754
THE FIRST WAVE OF ORDERS
HITS THE KITCHEN.

34:03.787 --> 34:05.322
OKAY, MICHAEL.
WATCH YOUR TEMPERATURE, YEAH?

34:05.355 --> 34:06.258
I DON'T WANT THE STEAKS
COMING BACK, OKAY?

34:06.258 --> 34:07.524
I DON'T WANT THE STEAKS
COMING BACK, OKAY?

34:07.558 --> 34:08.459
YES, CHEF.

34:08.492 --> 34:09.460
GOOD.

34:09.493 --> 34:10.627
EIGHT?

34:10.661 --> 34:12.129
PARTY OF EIGHT?
WHO'S EIGHT?

34:12.162 --> 34:13.397
WHATEVER EIGHT--
EIGHT COMES IN.

34:13.430 --> 34:14.998
THERE'S PLENTY
OF PRESSURE.

34:15.032 --> 34:17.101
A COUPLE OF TIMES,
I LOST MY COMPOSURE.

34:17.134 --> 34:18.836
LET'S GO.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.041
AND WHEN TOM DOES RETURN,

34:24.074 --> 34:25.709
HE BEGINS TO FEEL
THE HEAT ONCE AGAIN.

34:25.743 --> 34:27.511
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

34:30.214 --> 34:31.515
YES.

34:40.457 --> 34:42.126
I'LL DRIVE IF YOU'VE HAD
TOO MUCH.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.494
DON'T YOU WORRY.

34:45.262 --> 34:47.631
I'VE GOT TO TALK
TO YOU QUICKLY NOW.

34:47.664 --> 34:50.501
RIGHT. YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND
LIKE A.

34:50.534 --> 34:52.703
YEAH? YOU'RE
SWEATING LIKE A PIG.

34:52.736 --> 34:54.271
GET IN THE BATHROOM
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

34:54.304 --> 34:55.839
WHEN TOM CAME BACK,

34:55.873 --> 34:57.074
YOU COULD SEE
HE WAS JUST TOTALLY DISOR--

34:57.107 --> 34:58.609
LIKE DISARRANGED.

34:58.642 --> 35:01.645
YOU KNOW, HE WAS NERVOUS.
HE WAS NERVOUS.

35:01.678 --> 35:04.648
GOD, HE STINKS.

35:04.681 --> 35:06.258
IT'S 45 MINUTES
INTO DINNER SERVICE.

35:06.258 --> 35:08.485
IT'S 45 MINUTES
INTO DINNER SERVICE.

35:08.519 --> 35:11.221
AND THOUGH ALL APPEARS
TO BE GOING WELL...

35:13.457 --> 35:15.926
ONLY A FEW CUSTOMERS
HAVE BEEN SERVED.

35:15.959 --> 35:18.996
AND THE MAYOR IS NOT
ONE OF THEM.

35:19.029 --> 35:20.297
THEY GOT A MELTDOWN
IN THERE.

35:20.330 --> 35:21.899
AND THE, UH, MAYOR, YEAH?

35:21.932 --> 35:23.400
WE CAN'T KEEP HIM WAITING,
YEAH?

35:25.469 --> 35:27.171
WHAT TABLE NUMBER'S THAT?
UH, THAT'S 12.

35:27.204 --> 35:28.839
MAKE SURE HE KNOWS.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

35:28.872 --> 35:31.241
I NEED
THE MAYOR'S TABLE, MAN.

35:31.275 --> 35:33.410
I'M NOT GETTING TICKETS
THROUGH THIS PRINTER RIGHT NOW.

35:33.443 --> 35:35.179
WHY?
I DON'T KNOW.

35:35.212 --> 35:36.258
THIS PRINTER RIGHT HERE
IS NOT WORKING?

35:36.258 --> 35:37.281
THIS PRINTER RIGHT HERE
IS NOT WORKING?

35:37.314 --> 35:39.683
I'M NOT GETTING TICKETS
THROUGH THIS COMPUTER.

35:39.716 --> 35:41.251
IT'S GOING TO
ME UP.

35:45.556 --> 35:46.690
OH BOY.

35:46.723 --> 35:48.091
IT WAS A DISASTER.

35:48.125 --> 35:49.960
I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN
TO DEAN ABOUT THAT.

35:49.993 --> 35:51.795
AND I FINALLY SCREAMED,
CURSED, AND YELLED,

35:51.829 --> 35:53.130
"GET SOMEONE IN HERE
TO FIX THIS NOW

35:53.163 --> 35:54.598
OR WE'RE."

35:54.631 --> 35:56.400
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT NO ONE'S
COMING IN HERE

35:56.433 --> 35:58.335
TO FIX THIS
COMPUTER.

35:58.368 --> 35:59.803
BUT IF NOBODY WANTS
TO HEAR IT,

35:59.837 --> 36:00.671
NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR IT.

36:00.704 --> 36:02.673
HOW ABOUT THOSE STEAKS?

36:02.706 --> 36:04.575
HOW ABOUT THOSE STEAKS?

36:04.608 --> 36:06.258
HE'S  STANDING THERE
WITH HIS FINGER UP.

36:06.258 --> 36:06.643
HE'S  STANDING THERE
WITH HIS FINGER UP.

36:06.677 --> 36:08.245
I DON'T KNOW
IF DEAN UNDERSTANDS

36:08.278 --> 36:10.047
THAT WE'RE
THE WHOLE NIGHT

36:10.080 --> 36:11.215
AND YOU'LL BE DONE.

36:11.248 --> 36:13.350
OH GOD.

36:13.383 --> 36:14.885
NOW WE'RE SERIOUSLY
IN THE.

36:14.918 --> 36:16.186
ALL THE ORDERS
ARE BACKED UP.

36:16.220 --> 36:17.287
TABLES ARE WAITING.
TOM'S SWITCHED OFF.

36:17.321 --> 36:18.622
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

36:18.655 --> 36:21.658
WE'VE KEPT THE MAYOR WAITING
45 MINUTES.

36:21.692 --> 36:23.260
OF ALL THE PEOPLE
TO KEEP WAITING,

36:23.293 --> 36:24.595
NOT THE ING MAYOR.

36:26.129 --> 36:28.565
NOW MORE THAN AN HOUR
AND 15 MINUTES

36:28.599 --> 36:30.801
INTO SERVICE,
AND HUNGRY CUSTOMERS

36:30.834 --> 36:32.903
ARE GETTING RESTLESS.

36:46.283 --> 36:47.584
OKAY, MICHAEL.

36:49.019 --> 36:51.488
SOMEONE HAS TO FIX
THIS COMPUTER

36:51.521 --> 36:52.623
'CAUSE I'M NOT GETTING
TICKETS.

36:54.291 --> 36:55.659
UNBELIEVABLE.

36:55.692 --> 36:57.194
GET ME  DEAN, YEAH?

36:57.227 --> 36:59.096
PLEASE.
STRAIGHT AWAY, YES?

36:59.129 --> 37:01.231
DEAN, YOU HAVE TO GO
IN THE KITCHEN.

37:01.265 --> 37:02.766
I NEED THE MAYOR'S TABLE,
MAN.

37:02.799 --> 37:04.268
I DON'T KNOW--

37:04.301 --> 37:06.103
IT'S A  HOUR.

37:11.041 --> 37:12.843
IT'S NOT EASY GETTING KICKED
IN THE  EVERY DAY

37:12.876 --> 37:14.544
AND BEING TOLD
THAT YOU SUCK.

37:14.578 --> 37:16.380
I'M  EMBARRASSED,

37:18.916 --> 37:20.717

37:20.751 --> 37:22.219
WHY AREN'T I GETTING

37:22.252 --> 37:24.354
PLEASE HELP ME!

37:24.388 --> 37:27.257
I DON'T HAVE THE TICKET

THIS IS THE COPY.

37:28.725 --> 37:29.593
YOU GOTTA HAVE
THE OTHER HALF.

37:29.626 --> 37:30.928
THIS IS NOT MY TICKET.

37:30.961 --> 37:32.462
THIS COMES FROM
THE SALAD PRINTER.

37:32.496 --> 37:34.164
IT'S BEEN AN HOUR

37:59.889 --> 38:01.290
THIS COMES FROM
THE SALAD PRINTER.

38:01.323 --> 38:02.324

38:20.401 --> 38:21.177
MIKE. MIKE.

38:21.210 --> 38:23.579
JUST COME AROUND FOR TWO
SECONDS, PLEASE, YES?

38:23.612 --> 38:25.281
WITH DINNER SERVICE
ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER,

38:25.314 --> 38:28.417
GORDON LAYS IT ON THE LINE
FOR DEAN AND HIS STAFF.

38:28.451 --> 38:30.086
LET'S REGROUP
A LITTLE BIT, YEAH?

38:30.119 --> 38:31.253
LET ME JUST TELL YOU
THE SITUATION.

38:31.287 --> 38:32.988
SERVICE IS GONE.
WE'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

38:33.022 --> 38:34.123
LET'S GET THIS THING

38:34.156 --> 38:35.424
BACK ON LINE.

38:35.458 --> 38:37.059
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE
DECISIONS,

38:37.093 --> 38:38.861
ESPECIALLY AT THIS
CRITICAL MOMENT.

38:38.894 --> 38:41.263
THIS IS WHERE I NEED YOU NOW
TO FIGHT BACK.

38:41.297 --> 38:43.499
THIS IS GONNA MAKE
OR BREAK THIS PLACE.

38:43.532 --> 38:46.502
I WAS REALLY, REALLY
PISSED OFF.

38:46.535 --> 38:47.737
BUT RIGHT NOW

38:47.770 --> 38:49.405
FOR THE SAKE
OF THE SUCCESS HERE,

38:49.438 --> 38:50.401
I HAVE TO JUST
GET THROUGH IT.

38:50.401 --> 38:51.307
I HAVE TO JUST
GET THROUGH IT.

38:51.340 --> 38:52.608
LET'S GET SOME APPETIZERS.

38:52.641 --> 38:54.110
I'LL PUMP THOSE OUT
REAL FAST.

38:54.143 --> 38:55.411
AND THEN WE'LL GET YOU
IN THERE FOR YOUR ENTREE.

38:55.444 --> 38:56.879
YOU KNOW WHAT, I WILL
BE RIGHT BACK

38:56.912 --> 38:58.681
AND I WILL WRAP THOSE
UP FOR YOU.

38:58.714 --> 39:00.382
YOU KNOW,
AT THIS POINT NOW,

39:00.416 --> 39:01.584
LET'S WORK TOGETHER,
LET'S CORRECT IT.

39:01.617 --> 39:03.285
LET'S TRY TO CORRECT IT.

39:03.319 --> 39:04.820
SORRY FOR THE DELAY.
GIVE 'EM A STEAK KNIFE, PLEASE.

39:12.828 --> 39:13.863
GOOD DEAL.

39:13.896 --> 39:16.265
TWO MEDIUM RARE.
TWO MEDIUM.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.136
GIVE ME THAT.
IT'S 34.

39:20.169 --> 39:20.401
WELL, BON APPETIT.

39:20.401 --> 39:21.570
WELL, BON APPETIT.

39:21.604 --> 39:24.039
I CERTAINLY HOPE
IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT.

39:24.073 --> 39:25.107
EXCELLENT.

39:27.977 --> 39:30.613
AND THANKFULLY,
DEAN GETS EVERYONE FOCUSED.

39:30.646 --> 39:33.149
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.

39:33.182 --> 39:34.984
AND THE NIGHT AT LEAST FINISHES
SUCCESSFULLY.

39:35.017 --> 39:36.252
MORE WINE.

39:40.291 --> 39:42.727
THE NEXT DAY,
GORDON WANTS TO MAKE SURE

39:42.760 --> 39:44.228
THAT DEAN'S FEAR
OF FAILURE

39:44.262 --> 39:45.563
WOULD NO LONGER
STAND IN THE WAY

39:45.596 --> 39:47.298
OF HIS POTENTIAL SUCCESS.

39:47.331 --> 39:48.933
WHAT REALLY PISSES YOU OFF
THE MOST?

39:48.966 --> 39:50.334
WHAT IS IT?

39:50.368 --> 39:50.401
I KNOW THIS PLACE
COULD BE A RAVING SUCCESS.

39:50.401 --> 39:52.970
I KNOW THIS PLACE
COULD BE A RAVING SUCCESS.

39:53.004 --> 39:54.438
AND I'M NOT BEING BLIND.

39:54.472 --> 39:55.940
AND I'M NOT IN A
DREAM WORLD.

39:55.973 --> 39:57.341
THE FASCINATING THING
ABOUT YOU, DEAN,

39:57.375 --> 40:00.444
IS THAT YOU'RE--
YOU'RE SCARED OF FAILURE.

40:00.478 --> 40:03.414
WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES
AND THEN WE'LL TALK.

40:03.447 --> 40:05.583
I'VE FAILED BEFORE
IN BUSINESS.

40:05.616 --> 40:06.717
WHEN?

40:06.751 --> 40:08.419
I OPENED A RESTAURANT
IN MY HOME TOWN

40:08.452 --> 40:10.021
THINKING
I WAS THE DOG'S BOLLOCKS.

40:10.054 --> 40:11.489
AND IT MADE ME
THE PERSON I AM TODAY.

40:11.522 --> 40:13.925
HAVING BOTH SUCCESS
AND FAILURE.

40:13.958 --> 40:15.493
DON'T BE SCARED.

40:15.526 --> 40:17.728
YOU CAN'T KEEP ON
SIDESTEPPING PROBLEMS.

40:17.762 --> 40:20.401
I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT HE'S DOING IT

40:20.401 --> 40:20.531
I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT HE'S DOING IT

40:20.565 --> 40:21.566
FOR MY CAREER NOW.

40:21.599 --> 40:23.201
I REALLY BELIEVE HIM.

40:23.234 --> 40:27.305
PERHAPS DEEP DOWN I KNEW
THAT I NEEDED TO CHANGE.

40:27.338 --> 40:30.708
AND I CAN'T OVERLOOK
THINGS ANYMORE.

40:30.741 --> 40:32.310
YOU CAN'T TIPTOE OVER IT.

40:32.343 --> 40:35.012
THIS IS YOUR BUSINESS.

40:35.046 --> 40:36.614
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:36.647 --> 40:39.050
I GOTTA IMPLEMENT CHANGES
TO MAKE THIS WORK THIS TIME.

40:39.083 --> 40:41.252
I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

40:42.453 --> 40:44.222
WITH A FRESH, NEW,

40:44.255 --> 40:45.957
OPEN-MINDED ATTITUDE,

40:45.990 --> 40:47.725
DEAN MASTERFULLY
TOOK CONTROL

40:47.758 --> 40:49.594
OF THE FRONT
OF THE HOUSE...

40:49.627 --> 40:50.401
THERE WE GO.
WHO ELSE IS HAVING
THE FILET MIGNON?

40:50.401 --> 40:51.229
THERE WE GO.
WHO ELSE IS HAVING
THE FILET MIGNON?

40:51.262 --> 40:52.563
AND THE BACK
OF THE HOUSE.

40:52.597 --> 40:54.065
THAT PRIME RIB
LOOKS TO DIE FOR RIGHT THERE.

40:54.098 --> 40:56.267
THIS IS THE STEAK
FOR REAL STEAK EATERS.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.603
TOM STARTED TO GAIN
THE CONFIDENCE HE NEEDS

40:58.636 --> 40:59.904
IN HIS ROLE AS MANAGER.

40:59.937 --> 41:01.038
DID THEY GET
YOUR DRINKS YET?

41:01.072 --> 41:02.106
