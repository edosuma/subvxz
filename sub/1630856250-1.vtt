<i>You get used to it.</i>

00:16.767 --> 00:18.144
So far, a run on his prints
has been clean,

00:18.144 --> 00:19.645
but something could
still turn up.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.063

<i>No online profile at all.</i>

00:24.650 --> 00:25.860

exists is the fact

00:25.860 --> 00:27.611

00:27.611 --> 00:29.989

You're a thrift store.

You buying anything?

02:50.796 --> 02:52.214

03:12.776 --> 03:14.069

- 'Cause it's Doug's job.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.806
Keep taking out money.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.891

04:25.891 --> 04:27.726
Yes.

04:27.726 --> 04:31.730

you've been carjacked, right?

04:31.730 --> 04:33.691

Hi.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.314
- Want to see your mom?
- It's okay.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.941
It's okay.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.235
Come here. It's okay.
I mean, I'm here.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.862
Oh, baby.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.864
That guy will be out
for a while.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.574
Go in the bank, call the cops,
give them these.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.745
- Gun's in the car.
- Wait.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.496
Who are you?

05:29.496 --> 05:32.416
Someone who prefers
not getting involved.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.398
Here's $30.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.609
Need a new jacket.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.235
What's wrong with the one
you just bought?

06:00.235 --> 06:01.653
It has blood on it.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.199
Can I use your phone?

06:05.199 --> 06:07.826
I just got a message
from a friend.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.592
"Tammi Cates"?

06:23.592 --> 06:25.928
Let me guess. Bank teller,

06:25.928 --> 06:28.388
diner waitress,
thrift shop cashier?

06:28.388 --> 06:31.517
Third one. I got your message.

06:31.517 --> 06:34.269
110th. 10-30.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.646
A distress call.

06:35.646 --> 06:36.980
Distress call and airfare.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.398
I need you to come
to New York ASAP.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.526
<i>Why?</i>

06:41.693 --> 06:43.529
Calvin Franz was murdered.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.203
I'll let you know when I land.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.890
Major Reacher.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.725
Hello, sir.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.853
Just Reacher.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.479
I didn't tell you
to bring anything.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.815
Oh, um, just
some office supplies,

07:19.815 --> 07:21.900
in case there was any start-up
paperwork needed to be done.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.652
- I hate paperwork.
- That's okay,

07:23.652 --> 07:25.487
I don't mind doing any clerical
there might be, sir.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.823
- Reacher.
- Uh, r-right. Reacher.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.450
Um, I hope you don't
mind my asking,

07:30.450 --> 07:32.411
what exactly am I doing here?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.037
- Want out already, Franz?
- No, sir.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.747
Um, Reacher. Uh, no.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.667
I-I don't.
I'm just curious is all.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.377
Saw you a few weeks ago
by your barracks.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.337
Stopped a couple soldiers
from beating the hell

07:42.337 --> 07:44.173
of each other over a stolen
care package from home.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.300
Last cookie in the box, actually.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.509
One cookie?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.428
- Yeah.
- Even dumber.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.347
Bottom line, you negotiated
a fair settlement,

07:52.347 --> 07:55.851
cracked a few jokes,
de-escalated the conflict.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.603
Got a decent head on you.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.021
Might come in handy.

08:10.574 --> 08:13.285
Okay, I got to ask,
what the hell kind of unit

08:13.285 --> 08:15.704
did Major Reacher
put together here, huh?

08:15.704 --> 08:19.583
We got a bean counter
from Accounting Services,

08:19.583 --> 08:22.169
a gas jockey from bulk fuel,

08:22.169 --> 08:24.171
we got Dave Matthews,

08:24.171 --> 08:26.506
Grandpa Moses and, uh,

08:26.506 --> 08:29.676
a couple of guys from, uh...
where y'all from?

08:29.676 --> 08:31.511
I've seen you
in Requisitions, right?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.555
We've got names.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.057
Sanchez and Orozco.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.391
Which one's Orozco?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.940
And who are you, besides
a guy who talks too much?

08:42.940 --> 08:45.359
David O'Donnell.

08:45.359 --> 08:48.820
And no offense, Pops,
but, uh, why are you here?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.280
Isn't there a CBS drama
you're missing?

08:50.280 --> 08:52.366
Lowrey won the Army
Marksmanship competition

08:52.366 --> 08:55.077
six times,
both pistol and rifle class.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.828
I've got a rule.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.789
Plans go to hell
soon as first shot's been fired,

08:58.789 --> 09:01.166
so your first shot
better be your best shot.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.584
I'm the only non-Marine to win

09:02.584 --> 09:05.003
the USMC 1,000 Yard
Invitational, and I still know

09:05.003 --> 09:06.922
Lowrey gives us
our best first shot.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.341
You think this unit's gonna
come under a lot of fire?

09:09.341 --> 09:10.801
Maybe.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.135
Then why'd you
grab a bunch of people

09:12.135 --> 09:14.096
with no police experience,
Major Reacher?

09:14.096 --> 09:16.682
- Reacher.
- Reacher.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.351
Sorry.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.978
Army wanted a unit
for particularly

09:20.978 --> 09:22.896
complex matters when they arose.

09:22.896 --> 09:27.401
To do that, I need special
investigators, not generic MPs.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.778
If we're so special, why did
they stick us in this dump?

09:29.778 --> 09:31.655
I mean, what is up
with this place?

09:31.655 --> 09:33.615
Few years ago,
Uncle Sam made an auction bid

09:33.615 --> 09:35.450
for some land down the road.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.411
Entered the address backwards
and became the proud owners

09:37.411 --> 09:38.745
of this building
and the contents

09:38.745 --> 09:42.332
of the now-defunct
Callahan Insurance Agency.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.210
But you're right.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.504
Place could work
a little better.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.339
Straighten up these boxes,
move these old tanker desks

09:49.339 --> 09:52.301
to the middle
of the room.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.059
Let's go. You don't have
to call me "Major,"

10:01.059 --> 10:03.061
but you do have to move
your ass when I say so.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.563
Get to it.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.361
Go backwards.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.654
Okay, you want me
to go backwards?

10:12.654 --> 10:14.031
- I'm going backwards.
- Go back.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.949
Lift
with your legs, man!

10:15.949 --> 10:17.659
- No one lifts with their legs.
- On three. One, two, three, go.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.202
You're doing it wrong.

10:19.202 --> 10:22.372
I'm doing it
exactly how you told me to.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.666
You think we're actually gonna
be able to work together?

10:26.251 --> 10:28.670
No idea.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.756
But I could use a beer.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.717
Tell them I'm buying.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.844
Thanks for ordering.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.679
Still steam coming off the cup.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.641
Tracked the plane online,
saw it landed early,

11:22.641 --> 11:24.935
you don't check bags
and I adjusted for traffic.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.853
Had the coffee poured

11:26.853 --> 11:28.522

11:35.320 --> 11:38.240
I'm a PI. I can get things.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.785
Been a minute since Margrave.

11:41.785 --> 11:45.622
Been two years,

11:45.622 --> 11:47.207
You look good.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.126
I look the same.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.962
You looked good two years,
seven months,

11:51.962 --> 11:54.381
19 days ago, so, yeah.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.716
You look the same.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.636
You look... road-worn.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.471
Yep.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.307
So, Franz.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.560
Give me the Cliff Notes.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.353
Went missing after leaving
his home in Brooklyn

12:08.353 --> 12:09.980
about a week or so ago.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.399
Body was found
in the Catskill Mountains.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.401
Whole force up there
is, like, 20 cops.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.902
And since Franz disappeared
in the city,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.529
NYPD's taking the lead.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.780
How'd you find out?

12:18.780 --> 12:20.449
Got a call from Angela.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.577
Franzy's widow.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.787
- Franz was married?
- Yeah.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.998
Fun wedding. Chocolate fountain.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.500
He had a son, too.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.464
What? Life moves on
when you're away, big fella.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.510
- What else?
- Franz left me a few messages

12:40.510 --> 12:42.262
in the days before
his disappearance.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.930
Said he wanted to bounce
some stuff off of me

12:43.930 --> 12:45.724
about a case
he was chasing down.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.434
I was so tied up
with my own work,

12:47.434 --> 12:50.437
I kept meaning
to get back to him, but...

12:50.437 --> 12:51.938
before I could,
Angela reached out

12:51.938 --> 12:53.732
and told me he'd been murdered.

12:55.484 --> 12:56.902
It's not your fault.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.490
- I know.
- He wasn't just murdered.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.074
He was tortured.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.576
Nothing but mucus
in his stomach.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.786
Dehydrated. No food, no water.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.079
Chucked out of a plane.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.790
They didn't throw him
from a plane.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.459
He was found in the middle
of nowhere with injuries

13:12.459 --> 13:14.461
consistent with a fall
from 3,000 feet.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.630
An airplane has
a stall speed of what?

13:16.630 --> 13:18.965
80 miles an hour? 100, tops?

13:18.965 --> 13:20.550
They would've shoved him out
of the door's plane horizontally

13:20.550 --> 13:21.760
into the slipstream.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.345
He'd bang into the wing
or tail.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.597
There'd be perimortem injuries
and there aren't.

13:25.597 --> 13:28.725
He was thrown from a helicopter.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.852
His broken legs weren't
from the fall, anyway.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.271
Because?

13:33.271 --> 13:35.106
Look at his blood work.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.859
Full of free histamines.
Massive pain reaction.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.277
You don't get these kind
of levels from injuries

13:39.277 --> 13:40.695
sustained at the time of death.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.781
Broken legs were a few days old.

13:42.781 --> 13:46.076
That's why ferrous oxide powder
was found in his pants fabric.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.954
He was hit
with a rusty iron bar.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.749
- Must've hurt like hell.
- Yep.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.085
He was tortured for either
revenge or information.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.878
When they were done with him,
they dumped him from the sky

13:56.878 --> 13:58.421
to avoid ballistics.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.632
Couple of college kids
wandered off their hiking trail,

14:00.632 --> 14:02.259
saw the body.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.594
If not for them, who knows
when he would've been found?

14:08.640 --> 14:10.725
So, next steps?

14:13.270 --> 14:15.021
If he was calling you for help,
he may have been trying

14:15.021 --> 14:16.648
to get in touch
with the rest of the unit.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.024
Probably failed.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.442
I called O'Donnell, Dixon,

14:19.442 --> 14:21.528
Sanchez and Orozco.
No one's answering.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.780
No listed number for Swan.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.824
Even my office can't find it.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.993
Always a private guy.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.452
What about Lowrey?

14:29.452 --> 14:31.997
Killed two years ago
in a car accident in Montana.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.999
Funeral was sad, but...

14:33.999 --> 14:37.085
it was good
to see the gang again.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.046
Guess life ends
when you're away, too.

14:40.046 --> 14:43.133
Franz's wedding,
Lowrey's funeral.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.551
No one told me.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.094
No phone, no address.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.220
You could've sent me
an emergency

14:47.220 --> 14:48.805
ATM message like today.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.016
First off,
I just thought of that.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.643
Second, it wasn't
really an emergency.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.021
The emergency was the moment
the pickup hit Lowrey.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.064
And be honest,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.649
would you really have travelled
all the way to Montana

14:59.649 --> 15:02.319
from Texas or Maine
or wherever you were at the time

15:02.319 --> 15:04.321
just to look at a body in a box?

15:04.321 --> 15:05.947
No.

15:08.992 --> 15:12.621
So I'll ask again. Next steps?

15:14.122 --> 15:15.665
You really want
to let some other cops

15:15.665 --> 15:17.751
handle our dead friend's case?

15:20.462 --> 15:22.088
That's what I thought.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.926
Let's go see Franzy's widow.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.545
She just met up
with the big one.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.551
<i>You've reached
David O'Donnell.</i>

16:08.551 --> 16:11.304
<i>I'm not around; leave a message.
I'll call you back.</i>

16:11.304 --> 16:14.724
O'Donnell. This is Reacher
with another 10-30.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.519
Neagley and I are staying
at the Vale Hotel in Brooklyn.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.521
Get off your ass
and call us back.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.233
So, we can't call Swan.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.276
O'Donnell, Sanchez and Orozco
still don't answer.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.028
And the receptionist
at Dixon's office says

16:27.028 --> 16:29.948
she can't say where Dixon is
or when she'll return.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.158
Probably an undercover job.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.411
Maybe.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.705
Or maybe they're all
in trouble, too.

16:44.379 --> 16:47.382
<i>♪ I'd like a banana,
I'd like a banana ♪</i>

16:49.926 --> 16:51.803
<i>♪ I'd like a banana ♪</i>

16:52.804 --> 16:55.390
<i>♪ Bananas...</i>

16:55.390 --> 16:57.517
Mikey.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.353
Go find your crayons
and do some coloring time, okay?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.771
<i>♪ We just ran out of bananas...</i>

17:01.771 --> 17:02.981
Please sit.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.232
<i>♪ We just ran out of bananas ♪</i>

17:04.232 --> 17:06.317
<i>♪ Bananas ♪</i>

17:08.987 --> 17:11.322
Sorry it took me
so long to disengage.

17:11.322 --> 17:14.826
It's just hard to get
my sister off the phone.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.537
She calls every hour.
My own personal suicide watch.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.626
Sorry. That was, uh, morbid.

17:23.626 --> 17:24.836
I shouldn't have said that.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.045
After what
you've been through,

17:26.045 --> 17:27.964
you can say whatever you want.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.263
Can't believe how much
your son looks like Franzy.

17:37.599 --> 17:40.351
I called him Franzy, too.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.979
Which one of you gave him
that name again? I forgot.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.773
O'Donnell.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.900
Right. David O'Donnell.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.860
And he used to call you
The Big Guy.

17:48.860 --> 17:52.822
My God, did Calvin ever tell me
stories about you all.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.576
I know he loved me and Mikey
more than anything,

17:56.576 --> 17:59.537
but from the way he talked,
I don't think he ever

17:59.537 --> 18:03.041
had any more fun than his years
spent with the 110th.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.459
I don't know
about that.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.294
Ever since you guys
got together,

18:06.294 --> 18:09.005
whenever I talked to him,
he seemed joyful.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.217
Happier than I ever knew him.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.683
Thank you f-for saying that.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.066
I know the police have already
asked you a million questions,

18:28.066 --> 18:30.235
but do you think you could
walk us through the time line?

18:31.319 --> 18:34.447
Sure.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.992
I was away with Mikey in Provo,

18:37.992 --> 18:40.245
helping my sister with our mom.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.205
Early-onset dementia.

18:42.205 --> 18:45.458
I tried Calvin for a few days,
and no return calls.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.836
It's not like him,
so I started to worry.

18:47.836 --> 18:50.046
Called NYPD, they just said
he could've been out

18:50.046 --> 18:52.257
on a case because he was a PI

18:52.257 --> 18:54.384
or maybe he was out partying

18:54.384 --> 18:56.511
because his wife and kid
were out of town.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.763
Do you think
that's what he was doing?

18:58.763 --> 19:00.598
Out partying
with the wrong crowd?

19:04.060 --> 19:08.147
Cal would call if he was gonna
be ten minutes late for dinner.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.526
And he didn't party
with anybody.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.363
So I got so worried,

19:15.363 --> 19:18.199
I came back early
to find our home ransacked.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.617
Nothing was taken.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.620
The cops have no idea
who did it.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.206
Were you aware of any cases
Franz may have been working on?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.750
He never brought work home.

19:27.750 --> 19:31.004
He said when he was here,

19:31.004 --> 19:33.840
he wanted to be 100% present

19:33.840 --> 19:37.135
for me, and Mikey.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.223
I'm sorry. I want to help.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.892
It's just so hard.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.729
Every day hurts.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.981
Just a few more questions.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.316
Promise.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.444
Okay.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.488
What was his client base like?

19:58.615 --> 20:01.743
Wall Street types.
CEOs, the hedge fund crowd.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.287
Any of them particularly rough?

20:04.287 --> 20:05.997
Causing him problems?
Stressing him out?

20:05.997 --> 20:09.459
No. Not at all.
Once Mikey came along,

20:09.459 --> 20:11.669
he stopped doing
the dangerous jobs.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.172
Or so I thought.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.800
Were any other members of
the 110th working with him?

20:17.800 --> 20:20.386
I don't know. Maybe there's
something in his office.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.935
Sign on the door is Three Rivers
Consulting and Associates.

20:26.935 --> 20:30.480
It's 103 Flatbush.
It was trashed, too.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.981
The cops couldn't find
anything there,

20:31.981 --> 20:36.152
but from what Franzy
always told me,

20:36.152 --> 20:38.821
the Special Investigators
weren't any old group of cops.

20:39.864 --> 20:44.494
You do not mess with
the Special Investigators.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.545
Your daddy teach you that?

21:00.551 --> 21:04.889
Do you want to know how your dad
became a Special Investigator?

21:06.641 --> 21:09.602
He stopped a fight
between two huge soldiers

21:09.602 --> 21:11.771
because one of them thought
the other had stolen

21:11.771 --> 21:14.440
the last homemade cookie
sent to him from his mom.

21:16.275 --> 21:21.030
Your dad got them to shake hands
and be friends again.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.786
And this guy, right here,

21:26.786 --> 21:30.456
he wanted your dad to be
part of the 110th because...

21:31.958 --> 21:35.378
...he saw a man who stayed cool
when things got heated.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.844
That's how we became friends
with your dad.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.355
Okay.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.623
You know Franz ate the cookie.

22:12.623 --> 22:15.293
- Thought it was for everyone?
- Yup.

22:15.293 --> 22:17.128
I'm pretty sure that black sedan
halfway down the street

22:17.128 --> 22:19.088
was outside the diner, too.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.717
There's a black sedan on every
street in America. Get in.

22:33.436 --> 22:34.395
<i>Did the manager talk?</i>

22:34.395 --> 22:36.522
Nah, I paid off the concierge.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.317
He ID'd Neagley as checking in
under the name Sarah Conner

22:39.317 --> 22:41.486
and, uh, paying
for an adjoining room

22:41.486 --> 22:43.946
using the name Starlin Castro.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.573
That must be for the Hulk.

22:45.573 --> 22:49.577
Starlin Castro played for the
Yankees, six or seven years ago.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.537
<i>And who's
Sarah Conner?</i>

22:51.537 --> 22:54.415
I don't give a shit.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.417
Just keep an eye
on that hotel...

22:56.417 --> 22:57.919
and them.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.837
<i>Copy that.</i>

23:13.017 --> 23:15.269
Pretty modest for
a guy with Wall Street business.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.646
Unpretentious.

23:16.646 --> 23:19.941
Close to home so he can
spend more time with his family.

23:19.941 --> 23:22.527
Exact kind of place
Franzy would choose.

23:29.283 --> 23:31.828
Angela wasn't kidding
when she said trashed.

23:31.828 --> 23:34.372
They probably didn't
find anything.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.583
How do you know that?

23:37.583 --> 23:38.960
You don't go to this length
if you found

23:38.960 --> 23:40.962
what you needed right away.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.215
And they left pissed.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.592
They weren't looking
for anything

23:46.592 --> 23:47.718
behind this glass window,

23:47.718 --> 23:48.719
but they put that phone
through it.

23:48.719 --> 23:50.513
That's an act of frustration

23:50.513 --> 23:52.306
by someone who didn't find
what they wanted.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.559
Whatever they wanted was small.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.645
You don't snap chair legs
in half to see

23:57.645 --> 23:59.021
if they've been hollowed out
unless you're looking

23:59.021 --> 24:01.274
for something
that can fit in there.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.696
Hey.

24:08.406 --> 24:09.782
Check this out.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.664
Seems like yesterday.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.179
Keychain?

24:39.395 --> 24:42.148
Franz was sharp, right?

24:42.148 --> 24:43.482
Very sharp.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.650
So if he was dealing
with something

24:44.650 --> 24:46.152
that could get him killed,

24:46.152 --> 24:48.112
he'd have to put it in a place
that was very secure,

24:48.112 --> 24:49.739
but readily available.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.074
Somewhere in plain sight
that we see every day,

24:52.074 --> 24:54.410
but a place
no one would suspect.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.536
Okay.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.538
So what's a place
that's readily available

24:57.538 --> 25:00.875
that we entrust every day
with very important items?

25:01.876 --> 25:04.295
This is a mailbox key.

25:05.630 --> 25:08.883
I ever tell you
you're smart, Neagley?

25:08.883 --> 25:11.010
Not nearly enough.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.274
Shit. It's after 5:00.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.945
10,000 combinations
if it's a four-number code.

25:28.945 --> 25:31.155
- No point in trying.
- Good.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.698
Hate guessing passwords.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.617
We'll have
to come back tomorrow.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.037
So, what do we do now?

25:40.122 --> 25:42.458
Gin.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.502
I don't even know why I play.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.295
'Cause you hold out
hope you'll beat me.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.713
I won a few hands.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.842
If you let me win,
I'm gonna be pissed.

25:51.842 --> 25:55.346
I don't let you win.

25:55.346 --> 25:56.597
I pace myself.

25:56.597 --> 26:00.184
Not in your professional life.

26:00.184 --> 26:02.061
Don't follow.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.439
Rental car's a Range Rover,

26:05.439 --> 26:07.525
killer hotel rooms,

26:07.525 --> 26:09.402
sent me airfare
like it was nothing.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.737
You're doing well.

26:11.737 --> 26:15.866
Clearly not pacing yourself
in your professional life.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.080
Not to brag,
but the term "wunderkind"

26:21.080 --> 26:22.915
has been tossed
around the office.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.584
Two promotions
in the past two years.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.878
They're opening a satellite
office in St. Louis.

26:27.878 --> 26:30.506
Offered me director
if I wanted it.

26:30.506 --> 26:33.467
But I like being
in the field too much.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.011
Doing what?

26:35.011 --> 26:37.888
Mostly investigative work
for high-income individuals.

26:37.888 --> 26:42.351
Government entities, family
offices, that kind of thing.

26:42.351 --> 26:45.438
Once in a while
we do a pro bono case.

26:45.438 --> 26:48.858
Missing kids, stolen artwork...

26:48.858 --> 26:52.111
So, it's not just
about the money.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.487
It feels good.

26:53.487 --> 26:56.449
What about you?

26:56.449 --> 26:59.160
Saw a minor league game
in Sioux Falls a while back.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.537
Riveting.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.916
See it with anyone else?

27:07.251 --> 27:09.211
No.

27:11.005 --> 27:12.465
Did you, uh...

27:12.465 --> 27:15.301
talk to anyone at the game?

27:16.427 --> 27:18.054
I ordered a beer.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.098
Okay.

27:22.558 --> 27:25.978
Speaking of talking to people,

27:25.978 --> 27:28.481
when you went out to get gas,
I tried everyone again.

27:29.857 --> 27:32.193
Radio silence.

27:32.193 --> 27:33.486
Who'd you call the most?

27:33.486 --> 27:36.530
Sanchez? Orozco? O'Donnell?

27:36.530 --> 27:38.574
Or... Dixon?

27:38.574 --> 27:41.327
She has an answering service.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.453
Instead of leaving a voice mail,

27:42.453 --> 27:43.788
there's someone
to actually talk to.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.498
Right.
'Cause we just established

27:45.498 --> 27:47.625
how much you like
talking to people.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.169
Shut up.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.922
It's okay.

27:52.922 --> 27:55.591
It was always obvious you guys
had a thing for each other.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.802
Did you ever sleep together?

27:57.802 --> 27:58.928
No.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.471
Why not?

28:00.471 --> 28:01.764
Wouldn't have been appropriate.

28:01.764 --> 28:03.099
You were the same rank.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.059
I ran the team.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.603
Not appropriate.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.963
I get my pension deposit
in about a week.

28:33.963 --> 28:36.549
Not necessary.
I wouldn't have my career

28:36.549 --> 28:39.051
if I hadn't matriculated
at the School of Reacher.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.803
Consider it past-due tuition.

28:40.803 --> 28:43.305
Something tells me you would've
figured it out without me.

28:43.305 --> 28:45.057
Besides, it's a little weird

28:45.057 --> 28:47.017

28:47.017 --> 28:49.854
I'll get us square.

- Night, Reacher.

35:59.950 --> 36:02.536
Angela has no idea which
PO Box belonged to Calvin

36:02.536 --> 36:04.454
and the post office won't
give her that information

36:04.454 --> 36:06.039
until the estate
has been settled

36:06.039 --> 36:09.251
because the box was
in his company's name.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.003
Should we check his office
again for mail?

36:11.003 --> 36:14.089
We were thorough. Nothing in
there with a box number on it.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.383
We can't just go in there
and start trying boxes.

36:16.383 --> 36:17.968
They'll call the cops
and we'll wind up

36:17.968 --> 36:19.636
with federal
mail tampering charges.

36:19.636 --> 36:20.971
Then let's think this through.

36:20.971 --> 36:23.682
Like 89% of the world,
Franz is right-handed,

36:23.682 --> 36:25.559
so he probably asked for a box
on the right when you enter.

36:25.559 --> 36:27.895
Humans favor
their dominant side.

36:27.895 --> 36:29.354
He gets public records
sent to him,

36:29.354 --> 36:32.858
surveillance photos, so he's
gonna need one of the big boxes.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.943
I'll start with them, see
which one's packed with mail

36:34.943 --> 36:38.030
since Franz hasn't made
a pickup in a while.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.573
I just need a distraction.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.492
Copy that.

36:51.919 --> 36:55.339
Hey, how goes it... Albert?

36:55.339 --> 36:57.507

36:57.507 --> 37:01.011

37:01.011 --> 37:02.512

- Which run?

37:02.512 --> 37:04.514
We've got, uh, Desert Flowers,

37:04.514 --> 37:07.142
uh, State Birds
and the World of Anime.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.810
- All of 'em.
- Oh.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.103
I've got a bunch of Susan Bs
jingling in my pocket

37:10.103 --> 37:12.439
and I'm ready to spend 'em.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.316
Um, okay.

37:14.316 --> 37:18.987
There's at least two dozen
of these, uh, cartoons.

37:18.987 --> 37:22.616
If you're not familiar with
anime, I believe it's Japanese.

37:22.616 --> 37:23.825
You don't say.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.411
Oh, and uh...

37:26.411 --> 37:28.580
the State Birds are spectacular.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.750

37:41.718 --> 37:42.844

37:46.807 --> 37:48.475

37:48.475 --> 37:52.562
Yeah, I just... can't remember

37:52.562 --> 37:55.273

37:55.273 --> 37:57.484

- Sir, can I help you?

37:57.484 --> 37:59.569

- Sir.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.154

38:01.154 --> 38:02.614
No, sir, I'm gonna need some ID
that ties you to that box.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.449
You know what?
I'll take all of them.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.617
How about that?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.202
Here we go.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.121
No problem.

38:09.121 --> 38:11.415
Just got my boxes confused.

38:11.415 --> 38:13.709

hunch worked.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.857

38:36.857 --> 38:38.025
Not nearly enough.

38:38.025 --> 38:40.110

38:46.450 --> 38:48.660

My laptop has a different port.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.120

38:50.120 --> 38:51.496
Do me a favor.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.915
Order up a ride on
one of those phone app things.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.709
I need to borrow your car.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.171
You know Franz was killed
over this hard drive

38:59.171 --> 39:00.839
and now you want
to go get a gun.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.883
Yup.

39:02.883 --> 39:05.302
But first...

39:05.302 --> 39:07.846
I need to go to church.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.815
Excuse me.

39:18.815 --> 39:21.318
I was wondering if
I could ask for some help.

39:21.318 --> 39:24.112
Well, that is what we give here.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.822
I'm looking for my cousin.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.240
He has a really bad drug problem

39:27.240 --> 39:28.492
and a family friend
said they saw him

39:28.492 --> 39:30.077
living on the street
around here.

39:30.077 --> 39:31.495
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:31.495 --> 39:33.246
Well, thank you.

39:33.246 --> 39:35.082
I promised my aunt
I wouldn't come back home

39:35.082 --> 39:36.291
without her son.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.751
I don't know where
to even begin looking.

39:37.751 --> 39:39.961
And I thought maybe the church

39:39.961 --> 39:41.922
has a support group
or something, and...

39:41.922 --> 39:44.174
through that, maybe
you'd have some idea

39:44.174 --> 39:45.550
where Jimmy was scoring?

39:46.968 --> 39:48.303
The devil did his best work

39:48.303 --> 39:50.597
when he created
that poison, didn't he?

39:50.597 --> 39:52.057
Sure did.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.684
Almost everyone who comes in
to our outreach program

39:54.684 --> 39:57.270
gets their fix
from the same place:

39:57.270 --> 40:00.482
Dumont, just east of Rockaway.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.235
But you've got to have
a death wish

40:03.235 --> 40:04.694
to walk in there alone, son.

40:06.363 --> 40:07.739
I'll be fine, Father.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.743
I have righteousness on my side.

40:14.955 --> 40:17.415
<i>♪ She cried

40:17.415 --> 40:20.293
Little extra taste?
I'll get you back tomorrow?

40:20.293 --> 40:22.212
This ain't no
furniture warehouse, man.

40:22.212 --> 40:24.798
I don't do no credit.
Get the fuck out of here

40:24.798 --> 40:26.383
before I decide
to get off my couch, man.

40:26.383 --> 40:30.595

41:09.676 --> 41:12.888
I'll be taking this.

41:12.888 --> 41:15.390

Money in the bag?

41:55.931 --> 41:57.349
Help yourself.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.935
Six-figure instruments
are in the front.

41:59.935 --> 42:02.062
First time I heard
about bearer bonds

42:02.062 --> 42:03.772
was <i>Beverly Hills Cop.</i>

42:03.772 --> 42:05.815
I didn't know if they were real
or Hollywood bullshit.

42:06.942 --> 42:08.652
You could shine
a lighthouse on 'em, man.

42:08.652 --> 42:10.195
Watermarks are flawless.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.197
No one'll really know
who you really are.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.158
But you know.

42:37.806 --> 42:39.766
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:39.766 --> 42:41.268
- Just getting back?
- Yeah.

42:41.268 --> 42:44.187
Had to go to three stores
to get what I needed. You?

42:44.187 --> 42:46.147
Got everything I needed
in one place.

42:46.147 --> 42:47.315
Bet you did.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.985
Oh, shit.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.987
See you're still
using brass knuckles.

43:33.987 --> 43:35.196
No more switchblade?

43:35.196 --> 43:36.865
Look down.

43:38.533 --> 43:39.784
Hey, O'Donnell.

43:42.329 --> 43:43.413
Hey, Neagley.

43:44.914 --> 43:47.250
Don't blame me
for this shithole.

43:47.250 --> 43:48.626
I found it like this.

43:51.254 --> 43:55.592
I was with my family.
It was, uh, Unplugged Week.

43:55.592 --> 43:57.302
That sounds awful.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.262
No shit.

43:59.262 --> 44:01.014
Once a year, my wife
makes us get a cabin

44:01.014 --> 44:02.599
in the middle of nowhere,

44:02.599 --> 44:05.560
no cell phones,
no devices, no TVs.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.313
Less screens, more greens.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.774
Good in theory,
till by the third day

44:10.774 --> 44:12.150
my devil children want
to kill each other.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.611
So, I got home,
checked the voice mail,

44:14.611 --> 44:15.695
got here as quick as I could.

44:17.405 --> 44:20.617
Assholes snapped
my toothbrush in half.

44:20.617 --> 44:22.035
Now I own nothing.

44:22.035 --> 44:23.453
Glad to see you haven't changed.

44:23.453 --> 44:26.414
You have. Family vacations.

44:26.414 --> 44:28.375
Wife telling you what to do.

44:28.375 --> 44:30.377
Not the oversexed degenerate
I remember.

44:31.586 --> 44:32.796
I've been domesticated.

44:32.796 --> 44:34.756
Apparently.

44:37.634 --> 44:41.137
Got to say, pretty pissed
about this whole Franzy thing.

44:44.057 --> 44:45.475
Kind of loved that kid.

44:45.475 --> 44:46.935
So...

44:48.019 --> 44:50.313
...who we killing over it?

44:53.817 --> 44:56.194
When are you due
back on the catwalk?

44:56.194 --> 44:57.987
God, you must've been
mortified when you saw

44:57.987 --> 44:59.531
you were wearing the same
clothes as the homeless guy

44:59.531 --> 45:01.074
taking a shit
in a coffee can out back.

45:01.074 --> 45:03.159
Shit. Password protected.

45:03.159 --> 45:04.494
Hate guessing passwords.

45:04.494 --> 45:05.995
About to hate it more.

45:05.995 --> 45:07.831
Franz set it up so we get
three guesses in two minutes

45:07.831 --> 45:09.124
or the drive's erased.

45:09.124 --> 45:11.126
And it auto-launched
once it recognized a new device.

45:11.126 --> 45:12.794
- You got to be shitting me.
- Nope.

45:12.794 --> 45:14.629
Okay, so we got to break Franzy
down like we'd profile a perp.

45:14.629 --> 45:16.756
Passwords come from deep down.

45:16.756 --> 45:18.174
What was Franzy's thing?
What was he known for?

45:18.174 --> 45:19.467
Being smart.

45:19.467 --> 45:21.886
Yeah, but we
were all pretty smart.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.972
Pittsburgh? That's all
the guy talked about.

45:23.972 --> 45:26.141
Pirates, Steelers,
that, uh, that sandwich place

45:26.141 --> 45:27.225
where they put the fries on top.

45:27.225 --> 45:28.309
- Primanti Brothers.
- That was it.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.603
Yeah, but not Pittsburgh
in and of itself.

45:30.603 --> 45:32.272
It was his loyalty to it.

45:32.272 --> 45:33.606
Franz was a loyal guy.

45:33.606 --> 45:35.150
Still loved the 110th
after all these years,

45:35.150 --> 45:36.609
taught his kid our slogan.

45:36.609 --> 45:38.236
Do you remember
when he used to claim

45:38.236 --> 45:40.238
that the Pirates of '79 were
better than the Yankees of '78?

45:40.238 --> 45:42.490
I mean, the little shit wasn't
even alive when those teams

45:42.490 --> 45:43.783
played and he'd still
argue his ass off.

45:43.783 --> 45:45.326
Okay, but loyalty
is a byproduct.

45:45.326 --> 45:46.744
Where does it come from?

45:46.744 --> 45:49.956
Hero worship. Respect.
If Franz respected someone,

45:49.956 --> 45:51.124
he couldn't be dissuaded.

45:51.124 --> 45:52.584
Pirates were
the greatest team ever.

45:52.584 --> 45:54.377
Miles Davis was
the greatest musician ever.

45:54.377 --> 45:55.837
Franz was loyal
to what he respected.

45:55.837 --> 45:58.047
That's it. You got it.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.592
Roberto Clemente.

46:00.592 --> 46:02.260
He'd only use the last name.

46:03.636 --> 46:04.596
Wait!

46:04.596 --> 46:06.097
What about Willie Stargell?

46:06.097 --> 46:08.099
Did Willie Stargell
die in a plane crash

46:08.099 --> 46:10.226
delivering supplies
to earthquake victims?

46:10.226 --> 46:11.811
It's Clemente.

46:11.811 --> 46:14.105
No, it isn't.

46:14.105 --> 46:16.065
Who would use
a device like this?

46:16.065 --> 46:18.318
Franz. For this very reason.

46:18.318 --> 46:20.570
I'm gonna try Miles Davis.
Franz worshipped the guy.

46:20.570 --> 46:22.447
Good a guess as any.
Go for it.

46:22.447 --> 46:23.823
Nope.

46:23.823 --> 46:24.991
Shit.

46:24.991 --> 46:26.284
This is why I hate
guessing passwords.

46:27.577 --> 46:29.329
Oh, this makes me sick
to even suggest this,

46:29.329 --> 46:31.456
and outside of this room
I'll deny ever saying it,

46:31.456 --> 46:33.625
but who did Franz respect
more than anyone?

46:33.625 --> 46:35.126
Any ballplayer, any artist?

46:35.126 --> 46:37.003
Who did he hero worship?

46:37.003 --> 46:38.796
Get the hell out of here.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.673
A few weeks into the 110th,
the kid started cutting

46:40.673 --> 46:42.133
his hair like you,
talking like you,

46:42.133 --> 46:44.135
following you around.
He wanted to be you, Reacher.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.429
You better punch that.
We're running out of time.

46:51.684 --> 46:53.728
Son of a bitch.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.360
Don't go getting a big head.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.120
Hello.

47:13.623 --> 47:14.791
Would you like this?

47:19.796 --> 47:22.173
Now, do you know why
I love comic books so much?

47:23.716 --> 47:25.718
Because the good guys
always win.

47:25.718 --> 47:28.137
Mr. McBride?

47:28.137 --> 47:29.347
You're booked for
your flight to Denver.

47:29.347 --> 47:30.515
Enjoy your trip.

47:30.515 --> 47:32.725
Thank you. I certainly will.

47:43.820 --> 47:46.197
Andrew McBride. Alan Mason.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.366
Alejandro Mendez.
Alexander Markopoulos.

47:48.366 --> 47:51.661
Just a list of names, all
starting with the initials A.M.

47:51.661 --> 47:53.496
All aliases.

47:53.496 --> 47:54.956
You keep the same initials
so your signature

47:54.956 --> 47:56.374
never has to change.

47:56.374 --> 47:57.875
Just an A and an M
with a squiggle after it,

47:57.875 --> 47:59.294
no matter which pseudonym
you're using.

47:59.294 --> 48:00.712
Well, at least
you can read yours.

48:00.712 --> 48:03.172
I've just got page after page
of random numbers.

48:03.172 --> 48:04.716
No order. No meaning. Nothing.

48:04.716 --> 48:07.594
At least to us. For now.

48:07.594 --> 48:09.137
Well, whatever this shit is,

48:09.137 --> 48:10.972
it was enough to get Franz
killed, your rooms trashed,

48:10.972 --> 48:13.349
and God knows whatever else
we don't know about.

48:14.559 --> 48:17.353
These guys aren't shy
about getting aggressive.

48:17.353 --> 48:18.646
We need more manpower.

48:18.646 --> 48:20.481
Hate to say it, but he's right.

48:21.733 --> 48:23.109
None of the 110th are reachable.

48:23.109 --> 48:24.736
Well,
we send a Christmas card

48:24.736 --> 48:26.362
to Swan every year.

48:26.362 --> 48:28.323
I think he lives in Queens now.

48:28.323 --> 48:31.117
I'll have Lilly check
our holiday mailer list.

48:34.996 --> 48:35.913
What?

48:35.913 --> 48:38.541
You really are domesticated.

48:49.636 --> 48:51.888
No noise coming from inside.

48:51.888 --> 48:54.182
A little New York
background music?

48:57.226 --> 49:01.397
Yo, Carlo! Your mom says
you got to be home for dinner!

49:08.112 --> 49:10.573
Oh. You smell that?

49:12.116 --> 49:14.369
I'll take the upstairs.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.767
In here.

49:49.278 --> 49:51.781
Collar says Maisi.

49:55.535 --> 49:58.329
Drank the toilet bowl dry.

49:58.329 --> 50:01.624
Dehydration.
That's a tough way to die.

50:01.624 --> 50:03.835
Swan would never
let a dog die of thirst.

50:03.835 --> 50:05.086
The only way
he doesn't come home

50:05.086 --> 50:07.714
is if he couldn't come home.

50:07.714 --> 50:09.424
Swan's dead.

50:11.592 --> 50:15.179
Franzy, now Swan...

50:15.179 --> 50:17.432
We can't get ahold of
the other team members, either.

50:19.851 --> 50:21.561
Boss?

50:22.854 --> 50:25.022
What are you thinking?

50:27.692 --> 50:29.026
Major?

50:29.026 --> 50:31.154
I'm thinking
there's someone hellbent

50:31.154 --> 50:33.698
on taking out
the Special Investigators.

50:33.698 --> 50:36.284
And they're coming after us.

50:40.496 --> 50:42.623
