"Rush Hour"
Closed Captioned

00:02.169 --> 00:03.504
Previously on 90210:

00:03.545 --> 00:04.880
NAOMI:
This is the place!

00:04.922 --> 00:07.466
I'm sorry, it's too late.
An offer's been made.
I'm buying this house.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.426
What do you say to an extra
half a million dollars?
What?!

00:09.468 --> 00:12.179
Hey, congratulations.
You got yourself a deal.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.223
Will you marry me?

00:15.265 --> 00:16.558
No.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.561
This is a private party.
No hillbillies allowed.
My new roommate invited me.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.147
(over bullhorn):
Police. Nobody move.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.066
No, you want to hide pot
from the cops. You don't want
to throw it in the... fire.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.443
OFFICER:
Whose narcotics are these?

00:26.485 --> 00:28.278
No, they're not.
They're yours.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.739
It's my senior year in high
school. I told Mom a million
times how

00:30.781 --> 00:33.534
important that is to me. Maybe
she'll let me stay with you.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.244
Pull this crap again, and I
will put you on a plane to
Switzerland so fast...

00:36.286 --> 00:38.831
I hate both of you!

00:38.873 --> 00:41.208
Leila!
She ran away.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.668
Spent all summer on
a fishing boat.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.294
This is the first real
money I ever made.

00:44.336 --> 00:45.880
Where's my check-- where's my
check?

00:45.921 --> 00:48.215
Morning, boss.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.424
(sighs)

00:49.466 --> 00:52.093
♪ ♪

01:02.813 --> 01:07.108
(chanting)

01:07.150 --> 01:08.068
Wow.

01:08.109 --> 01:11.030
C.U. really takes this Pledge
Week stuff seriously.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.781
Who would volunteer to humiliate
themselves like that?

01:12.823 --> 01:15.993
Hey, Naomi Clark, you suck!

01:16.035 --> 01:18.119
(laughter)

01:20.330 --> 01:22.332
(gasps)

01:22.374 --> 01:24.668
Trust me--

01:24.710 --> 01:26.169
swallowing a tank
full of goldfish

01:26.211 --> 01:28.839
is much better than being the
most hated girl on campus.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.674
You got to admit,
you kind of earned it.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.593
I mean, your party got
busted by the cops,

01:32.634 --> 01:34.553
the dean banned all student
social events for the next month

01:34.595 --> 01:37.431
and the football captain
tested positive for pot

01:37.472 --> 01:40.559
because of the contact high
he got from your bonfire.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.020
Football season's
basically over.

01:43.062 --> 01:46.774
You know what we need to do?
Join a sorority.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.985
Yeah, why start college with
one ounce of dignity left?

01:50.027 --> 01:53.822
It will be fun. It will
position us socially.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.033
I've always wanted to join
a sorority.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.326
It's like a sisterhood
for life.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.912
Yeah, a sisterhood with

01:59.954 --> 02:01.956
a bunch of people I don't
know or care about.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.416
Okay, do you know who
the cute frat boys date?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.251
Cute girls who are
in sororities.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.461
Do not be such a snob.

02:08.502 --> 02:11.423
I have a feeling I'm really
going to regret this, Naomi,

02:11.465 --> 02:14.217
but, fine, which
one do we join?

02:14.259 --> 02:16.344
Oh, we're going
straight to the top.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.430
Kappa Lambda Eta.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.933
They're known for the hottest
girls, wildest parties.

02:20.975 --> 02:24.812
It is the best house on campus,
and it is where we belong.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.115
(sighs)

02:36.156 --> 02:38.366
Hey, Dixon, I was going to make
pancakes, but you guys

02:38.408 --> 02:40.744
don't have any
eggs or milk

02:40.786 --> 02:42.496
or pancake mix.
Seriously, Ade...

02:42.537 --> 02:45.540
I know what you're going
to say, but it's no trouble.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.044
(whistling "Dixie")

02:49.086 --> 02:52.006
Oh, hell no. You better not
be whistling "Dixie."

02:53.882 --> 02:55.300
Hey!
Good morning.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.594
Hey, last night was,
uh, was fun.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.763
Yeah.
But I actually got
to head to class.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.599
But, hey, don't feel like
you got to rush out of here.
Really?

03:02.641 --> 03:04.559
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.811
Uh...

03:07.646 --> 03:09.356
Bye.

03:09.397 --> 03:12.526
I guess I'm going to go
hop in the shower.
Yeah.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.194
Dixon?

03:16.905 --> 03:17.865
(laughs)

03:17.906 --> 03:19.533
Dead man walking.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.493
What the hell
happened last night?

03:21.535 --> 03:22.995
You mean before or after

03:23.037 --> 03:24.913
your humiliating proposal
to my sister?

03:24.955 --> 03:27.332
That's... After.
I left you
drowning your sorrows,

03:27.374 --> 03:29.084
at that old beach bar. Why?

03:29.126 --> 03:33.172
Oh, I don't know-- I think
I bought the place.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.006
Are you serious?

03:34.048 --> 03:36.591
Yeah.
(laughing)

03:36.633 --> 03:38.593
This is hilarious.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.221
No, this is not hilarious.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.182
We got to find that old man
and get my money back.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.934
Dude, as much
as I would love to,

03:45.976 --> 03:48.478
I... I can't.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.690
DJ 526 just hooked me up
with this big meeting.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.525
Juice Randall.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.945
You don't know who
Juice Randall is?

03:56.987 --> 03:58.321
Been on a boat all summer.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.533
Was that boat in a cave,
on another planet,

04:01.575 --> 04:03.702
in a black hole somewhere?
Dude, he's only

04:03.744 --> 04:05.662
one of the hugest producers
on the East Coast.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.873
Look, I got to finish these
tracks for Juice,

04:07.915 --> 04:10.667
just to prove that I didn't give
up going to college for nothing.

04:10.709 --> 04:11.835
Yeah, you know what,
you're right.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.212
That's as important as me

04:13.253 --> 04:14.796
losing $25,000!

04:14.838 --> 04:16.839
(sighs)

04:16.882 --> 04:18.716
This money is all I have, man.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.594
I got to get it back,
or else I'm going to be

04:20.635 --> 04:22.429
sleeping on your couch
for the rest of my life

04:22.470 --> 04:25.891
and you're never going to
get those tracks done.
Okay, all right.

04:25.933 --> 04:26.683
Fine.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.475
We can go get it.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.644
But after that, I have
to get this music done.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.645
No more distractions.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.399
Hey, Liam.
Hey.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.198
Was that real,
or am I still drunk?

04:41.240 --> 04:43.658
NAVID:
Hey, Mom, what's up?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.452
Hey, honey, I need
to talk to Leila.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.997
Oh, you want to-- you want to
speak to Leila? Uh...

04:49.039 --> 04:51.125
Well, Mom, uh, the truth is...
(banging)

04:51.166 --> 04:54.002
Leila is...

04:54.044 --> 04:56.004
in the shower.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.547
Yeah, I'll tell her you called.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.382
Okay. Make sure she calls me.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.970
Okay. I love you, too.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.306
Great. Now I'm lying
to my parents.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.267
How am I going to tell them
that I lost their daughter?

05:08.308 --> 05:11.019
Technically you didn't lose her.
She ran away.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.020
How is that better?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.021
Check this out.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.355
This is Leila's
Twitter feed.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.275
She's updated it five times
in the last hour

05:16.316 --> 05:18.485
so wherever she is, I think
she's probably fine.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.861
Unless, of course,
you consider tweeting

05:19.903 --> 05:22.114
"hashtag I heart Bieber"
a problem.

05:22.156 --> 05:25.366
No, you're right.
She's probably fine.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.202
She is fine. Trust me.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.454
I used to pull this move on
Kelly all the time.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.747
So we're just supposed
to go on with our lives?

05:30.789 --> 05:32.415
We're not going
to go looking for her?

05:32.457 --> 05:33.583
Um, I'm not going
to look for her,

05:33.625 --> 05:35.961
you know,
'cause she's not missing.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.588
So...
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

05:38.630 --> 05:41.091
Uh, I'm going to go
cover for you at the office.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.177
So you can stay here and focus
all of your energies

05:43.218 --> 05:45.262
on the rescue effort.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.888
Good luck.

05:46.930 --> 05:47.388
I believe in you.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.937
Look, give him his money back
or we'll tell the cops

05:53.979 --> 05:56.273
that you've been
serving underage kids.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.066
Oh, okay, take
it easy.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.444
He can have
his money back.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.070
Really?

06:02.112 --> 06:03.905
Look, I'm not trying
to screw anybody.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.115
I'm just kind of surprised.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.284
You were so set on
buying this place.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.618
I've seen guys crying
in their beer,

06:08.660 --> 06:10.369
but never like
that before.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.371
Oh, you were talking
about your summer

06:12.413 --> 06:13.581
and going on
about some girl--

06:13.623 --> 06:15.083
I think you said
her name was Jane.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.710
Jane?

06:16.751 --> 06:18.461
(laughing)
Jane? No, I think
you meant Annie.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.047
Dude, how drunk were
you last night?

06:20.088 --> 06:20.630
I don't know, man.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.800
You kept saying buying
this place would help
you move on from your past

06:23.842 --> 06:25.927
and make sure you
never went back.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.428
You know, um, I don't think
my friend

06:27.470 --> 06:29.639
was in his right mind
last night.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.098
So, uh,

06:30.140 --> 06:32.100
you know, just-just give us
the money back

06:32.142 --> 06:34.519
and we'll be on our way.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.854
I'll get him his check.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.070
Wait.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.742
Keep the check.

06:48.783 --> 06:49.159
I want the bar.

06:51.786 --> 06:52.996
Uh... (nervous chuckle)

06:53.038 --> 06:56.041
Um, Liam, one minute you're
proposing to Annie,

06:56.083 --> 06:59.127
the next you're buying a bar?

06:59.169 --> 07:00.379
When are you going to tell me
what's really going on?

07:00.419 --> 07:02.839
Nothing's going on.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.799
Liam, seriously.

07:04.841 --> 07:08.178
What happened this summer, man?

07:08.220 --> 07:10.305
Summer's over.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.390
I'm keeping the bar.

07:31.368 --> 07:34.246
So as a member
of Tau Pi Nu,

07:34.288 --> 07:35.872
you got any advice
for a pledge?

07:35.914 --> 07:37.665
Yeah, don't fall asleep.

07:37.707 --> 07:41.002
I made that mistake. My frat
brothers nailed my face
with permanent marker.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.045
Lovely.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.797
Here you go.
That'll be $6.80.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.215
Thanks.
Oh, I got it.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.888
Actually, I don't got it.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.181
I forgot my wallet.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.308
Don't worry about it.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.310
Here you go.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.353
Are you sure?
I feel like an idiot.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.938
Oh, please. You're giving me

07:59.980 --> 08:02.523
all this vital knowledge.
It's the least I can do.

08:02.565 --> 08:06.736
Okay, in that case, let me
tell you how I got revenge

08:06.778 --> 08:08.196
for that little
marker incident.
Oh.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.576
You're here... still.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.330
Hey, what's that smell?

08:16.371 --> 08:17.456
Potpourri.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.540
I bought a few things.

08:19.582 --> 08:23.044
I mean, this place is nice,
but it needed a woman's touch.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.504
Don't you think?

08:24.545 --> 08:26.340
No.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.467
I-I mean, I mean...

08:28.508 --> 08:30.469
no, I didn't, until now.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.971
Is Dixon even around?

08:33.013 --> 08:36.015
I don't...
Dixon, you home?

08:36.057 --> 08:38.309
(stammers) Navid, hey.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.644
Hey.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.772
Um, Dixon's gone.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.815
(softly):
At least somebody is.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.901
Uh, okay. Well,
can you tell Dixon,

08:46.943 --> 08:48.862
I just... I just
came by to hang out?

08:48.903 --> 08:50.822
And, uh, maybe hit
the mall or the beach.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.033
Wait, the mall?

08:53.074 --> 08:55.660
Do you plan on going to the food
court and reading comic books?

08:55.702 --> 08:58.246
Uh... I'm looking
for Leila.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.498
She's missing.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.249
Oh, no. What happened?

09:01.291 --> 09:03.668
We had a fight about her
bringing you to Naomi's party,

09:03.710 --> 09:06.129
and, uh, she ran away.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.798
I-I should have known better
than to go to that party.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.925
I feel terrible.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.261
I really wish that I could
help you find her.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.182
Call her friends.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.184
Um, remember Jenny,

09:19.226 --> 09:20.560
with the freckles?

09:20.601 --> 09:21.728
She and Leila were pretty close.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.937
Jenny, yeah, yeah.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.856
That's a good idea.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.151
Thanks for your help.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.778
Of course.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.953
NAOMI:
Here we are.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.123
So do you think the
flowers are a bit much?

09:42.165 --> 09:43.750
We have to look classy

09:43.791 --> 09:45.793
if we want to get
a bid from Kappa.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.838
Freshly picked from
Mrs. Rosen's garden.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.840
You know that it is possible
she wasn't the neighbor

09:50.882 --> 09:53.093
that called the cops?
Oh, it was her.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.763
Underneath that lovely
housecoat is a total bitch.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.348
How was your date
with Jeremy?

09:58.390 --> 10:00.725
It wasn't a date.
We just got coffee.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.143
He didn't buy you dinner?

10:02.185 --> 10:05.063
No. Actually I paid.
He forgot his wallet.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.567
(clearing throat)
Gold digger alert.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.485
First you're buying
their coffee--

10:10.527 --> 10:12.195
then you're charging their
Porsche to your black card.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.573
Trust me, when you're loaded,

10:14.614 --> 10:16.116
boys just come out
of the woodwork.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.535
Thanks for putting
that in my head.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.788
Would you look at
some of these gals?

10:21.829 --> 10:24.124
We're so in.
Let's divide and conquer.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.750
What? No, I...

10:25.792 --> 10:27.210
I prefer strength in numbers.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.920
Sorry.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.507
Hi. I'm Bree.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.633
Hi.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.884
I love your dress.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.219
Well, thank you.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.887
Yeah. Why don't I
show you around?

10:37.929 --> 10:39.097
Okay.
Awesome.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.225
Ladies.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.935
Naomi Clark.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.437
Aren't you the girl who threw

10:45.479 --> 10:47.522
that party last night?

10:47.564 --> 10:49.941
You know what they say--
go big or go home.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.943
Good idea.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.237
Girls.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.239
Show a little
hospitality.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.199
Remember our motto--
"Sisterhood above all else."

10:58.241 --> 10:59.534
After what she did?

10:59.576 --> 11:03.163
Margo, I think your unibrow's
growing back.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.082
Did you forget you tweezers in
Shaker Heights?

11:08.335 --> 11:11.045
I am so sorry about that.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.880
They get so aggressive
on Bid Night.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.008
I try to tell them
to eat less red meat.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.551
(both laugh)

11:16.593 --> 11:18.136
Hi, I'm Holly.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.262
Hi. Naomi...

11:19.304 --> 11:20.888
Clark. I know.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.932
I suppose everyone knows.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.559
Yes, but don't worry about it.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.102
Aside from the drug bust,

11:26.144 --> 11:27.854
your party sounds like
it was pretty legendary.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.981
The kind of party
a Kappa would throw.
Really?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.859
Definitely. And if it
makes you feel any better,

11:32.900 --> 11:35.320
I had a pretty rough
week my freshman year, too.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.572
I drank too much and threw
up at the football game.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.907
They caught the whole thing on
the Jumbotron, then played

11:39.949 --> 11:42.076
it backwards so the vomit was
going back into my mouth.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.829
Oh, my...
That took a couple
weeks to live down.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.499
But thank God college isn't
anything like high school.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.042
This stuff doesn't
follow you around forever.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.335
Thank you.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.545
No problem.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.796
(sighs)
So...

11:53.838 --> 11:56.675
what does a girl have to do to
get a bid around here?

11:56.715 --> 11:59.760
Uh, well, it helps
if you suck up

11:59.802 --> 12:01.054
to the sorority president...

12:01.095 --> 12:02.847
Okay.
...moi.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.849
(laughs)
Okay.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.227
You know what? Every year

12:07.268 --> 12:08.603
I take a pledge
under my wing

12:08.645 --> 12:10.897
and I make her
my Little Sister.

12:10.938 --> 12:14.025
What do you say?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.652
I say yes.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.029
Great.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.947
Welcome to Kappa.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.621
LIAM:
Sure, it looks bad now,

12:26.663 --> 12:28.707
but with a little work,
it could be great.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.542
Just gotta figure out
where to start.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.587
Yeah, how about starting
with a tetanus shot?

12:33.628 --> 12:35.838
I'm serious. I'm gonna, uh...

12:35.880 --> 12:38.007
get some old
surfboards to hang up here.

12:38.049 --> 12:38.883
Maybe build a stage over here.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.427
Get some live bands
to play.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.760
Yeah, that's good
for you.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.304
Still sounds like a lot of work.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.056
Oh, hey, speaking of,
aren't you working on

12:45.098 --> 12:46.849
those tracks
for Juice or Fruit...?

12:46.891 --> 12:47.975
Randall.
Yeah.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.894
(laughs) Yeah, but
it's impossible

12:49.936 --> 12:51.854
to get any work done with
Adrianna still there, so...

12:51.896 --> 12:53.814
Ooh. Maybe I could help.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.774
You know,
I can beatbox, right?
No.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.652
(beatboxing)
Stop. No, no.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.739
No, no, no. Stop,
stop, stop, stop!

13:00.779 --> 13:02.532
I'm gonna get
some surfboards.
Cool.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.701
(laughs)

13:04.743 --> 13:06.411
(coughs)

13:06.453 --> 13:07.870
Excuse me.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.330
I'm looking for Liam Court.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.750
Um, actually,
he'll be right back.

13:11.790 --> 13:12.833
Hi, I'm Dixon.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.001
My name's Jane.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.795
So, there actually is a Jane.

13:16.837 --> 13:17.796
How do you know Liam?

13:17.838 --> 13:19.215
We were friends in Alaska.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.138
What are you doing here?

13:26.306 --> 13:29.559
I wanted to see you.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.269
Uh, I'll let you two catch up.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.771
Great to meet you.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.649
Nice to meet you.

13:35.690 --> 13:38.693
So, I talked
to your boat captain.

13:38.735 --> 13:42.155
Jane, why are you here?

13:42.196 --> 13:43.406
You left without saying
good-bye.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.867
You disappeared.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.286
I was worried.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.538
Worried enough
to come 2,000 miles?

13:53.874 --> 13:55.918
You and Jim were so close.

13:55.960 --> 14:00.340
You're the only person besides
me who really knew him.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.591
And you're the only one

14:01.633 --> 14:05.386
who really understands
the loss I feel.

14:05.428 --> 14:09.182
What you and I are feeling is...
is not the same thing.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.018
Liam, please talk to me.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.359
There's something
I never told you

14:19.400 --> 14:21.319
about that night on the boat.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.195
I was supposed
to be working,

14:22.236 --> 14:24.656
but I was sick,

14:24.698 --> 14:27.408
so Jim offered
to cover for me.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.452
That's when the accident
happened.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.540
The siren woke me up.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.667
And when I got up top,
that's when they...

14:35.709 --> 14:38.628
that's when they told me
he was gone.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.174
See, that should have been me.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.845
Jim took my place that night.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.890
Your husband is dead
because of me.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.480
Hey.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.064
Any word on Leila?

14:58.105 --> 15:00.066
No.

15:00.107 --> 15:03.027
Well, like you said, uh,
she'll turn up eventually.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.529
Actually, she stopped
updating her Twitter feed

15:04.571 --> 15:05.697
a few hours ago.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.408
Uh, not that I'm
worried, but...
Okay.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.868
...she's showing a lot more
willpower than I ever did,

15:09.909 --> 15:13.663
So I-I'm texting her every 30
seconds till I flush her out.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.958
(text alert sounds)
It's a... it's a
text from Leila.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.293
Oh, thank God.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.795
Worked like a charm.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.297
It's a video.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.050
Navid, they want $50,000.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.177
And they said
get the money ready

15:28.219 --> 15:30.430
and-and don't go to the police.

15:30.471 --> 15:34.975
(sobbing): Please help me!
I'm really scared!

15:41.608 --> 15:43.025
NAVID: God, I don't even know
where the hell

15:43.067 --> 15:45.986
I'm gonna get $50,000.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.988
I mean, things are tight
at the studio.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.073
We can't call the cops.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.118
I mean, they said don't call
the cops, so what do we do?

15:52.159 --> 15:53.286
Do we call the cops?

15:53.327 --> 15:54.746
Calm down, all right?

15:54.788 --> 15:56.247
Don't you think this is
a little weird?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.540
Compared to what?

15:57.582 --> 15:59.751
Compared to the kidnappings
I'm used to dealing with?

15:59.793 --> 16:01.795
Come look at this video.

16:01.836 --> 16:05.339
Leila, she's got an empty yogurt
cup in the trash beside her.

16:05.381 --> 16:05.965
Wherever she is,

16:06.006 --> 16:08.468
she's not exactly being
tortured, you know?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.887
And everybody knows
that Shirazis are loaded.

16:10.929 --> 16:13.306
These guys ask for 50 grand?
I'm not buying it.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.266
Why, because that would mean you
were wrong,

16:15.308 --> 16:17.644
that we should've been looking
for her hours ago?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.938
Okay, you're right, you know?
I should not have looked

16:19.979 --> 16:21.689
at this and taken it so lightly,

16:21.731 --> 16:24.442
but let's just stay calm and
we're gonna look at the facts.

16:24.484 --> 16:28.321
The facts are, Silver,
my sister's been kidnapped!

16:28.362 --> 16:28.947
You know, I can't
believe

16:28.988 --> 16:30.907
you're still not
taking this seriously.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.827
Even Adrianna
offered to help!

16:33.868 --> 16:35.745
Wait. What?

16:35.787 --> 16:37.330
When did you talk to Adrianna?

16:37.371 --> 16:40.374
She was at Dixon's when
I went looking for help.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.001
Ade didn't blow it off.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.962
No, at least she cares.
Ever since my sister's

16:44.003 --> 16:46.339
been missing, you've been
acting like it's no big deal.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.550
Maybe you'd get it if your
family was ever around.

16:49.592 --> 16:50.885
Yeah, maybe I would.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.391
(box thuds)

16:57.433 --> 17:00.144
(door opens, closes)

17:00.186 --> 17:03.857
Congratulations, ladies, you are
now probationary members.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.108
In order to become
full-fledged Kappas,

17:06.150 --> 17:09.028
you have to pass
the three Trials of Fire.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.113
That doesn't sound
so good.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.031
It weeds out the losers.
Just go with it.

17:15.993 --> 17:16.786
Okay.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.623
(laughs) Very good.

17:20.665 --> 17:21.708
Very nice!

17:21.749 --> 17:24.002
Ew! Okay, I'm done.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.252
Nice. You really
sold that one.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.256
Well, he's my favorite
president.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.301
Well, that is the completion
of trial number one.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.135
That was pretty easy.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.763
Well, we're gonna be sisters
for life.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.932
I don't want you
to hate my guts.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.559
Here, I brought
you mouthwash.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.060
Oh, thank you.
(both laugh)

17:42.937 --> 17:46.983
All right, Little Sister,
here is your first trial.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.445
No problem.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.239
♪ ♪

18:02.749 --> 18:04.751

18:12.550 --> 18:13.843

Really... funny.

No problem.

There you are.

What do you want?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.916
I need your help.

18:44.958 --> 18:45.959
I'm pledging
Kappa.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.001
Of course you are.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.210
Yeah, you'll
fit in great

18:48.252 --> 18:49.754
with the rest of them
stuck-up princesses.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.755
Thank you.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.715
My second Trial of
Fire is to have

18:52.757 --> 18:54.842
a candlelit,
gourmet meal with
a farm animal.

18:54.884 --> 18:55.969
And since I loathe
the thought

18:56.010 --> 18:58.220
of having dinner with you,
I need your pig.

18:58.262 --> 19:01.265
Ah, now why would I let you
borrow Faulkner?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.142
'Cause it was your stupid pot
that got me in trouble

19:03.183 --> 19:04.811
in the first place.
You owe me.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.396
Fine, fine.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.273
But he's at a farm in Topanga

19:09.315 --> 19:11.025
because my place isn't big
enough.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.820
Just tell them I sent you,
all right? Good.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.113
Thank you.
Hey, you know,

19:15.154 --> 19:17.364
maybe your parents aren't
directly related.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.660
They're just second cousins
or something.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.750
Hey, uh, if you want Faulkner
to behave,

19:27.792 --> 19:30.628
try playing some opera, okay?

19:30.670 --> 19:31.545
He loves Rossini.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.714
Rossini. Got it.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.934
Hey, Dix, Dix, man, I got...

19:47.353 --> 19:49.188
What the hell was that?!

19:49.229 --> 19:51.524
Um, Adrianna.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.900
Is she still here?
Yeah. She moved

19:52.942 --> 19:54.610
some of the furniture.
Better feng shui.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.362
You should see what
she's doing with your room.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.280
Dude, when are you gonna tell
her to leave?
Me?

19:58.322 --> 20:00.449
Yes, you.
Why would I do that?

20:00.491 --> 20:02.618
Because, man, she came here
to see you in the first place.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.996
It was all you, buddy.
Okay, time-out.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.164
Okay, if we're gonna be
roommates,

20:06.205 --> 20:07.748
there's gonna have
to be some rules.

20:07.790 --> 20:11.627
Like number one, keep your
smelly cowboy boots

20:11.669 --> 20:14.547
away from
anywhere there's food, okay?

20:14.588 --> 20:17.383
Number two, don't be singing
your ballads of the Confederacy

20:17.424 --> 20:18.885
in the bathroom. It's not cool.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.971
And three, don't have sex with
random girls who show up

20:22.013 --> 20:23.597
at the door in
the middle of the night.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.641
We didn't actually
have sex, okay?

20:25.683 --> 20:26.976
We just made out a little
and fell asleep.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.477
That's all.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.813
Man, who peed in your grits
this morning?

20:30.855 --> 20:33.774
(chuckles) Uh, nobody.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.568
I'm sorry, man.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.945
I'm just stressed out about this
meeting with Juice.

20:37.987 --> 20:41.032
And I just got some bad news
about my friend Liam's bar.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.034
It turns out you actually got
to be 21 to sell liquor.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.995
So now I got to go down there
and tell him that we might have

20:46.037 --> 20:49.415
to turn the bar into
a Chuck E. Cheese.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.626
Well, hey, uh, your buddy's
not 21, but I am.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.753
I'll sign his license.

20:55.796 --> 20:56.839
Really?
Really.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.257
What's in it for you?

20:58.298 --> 21:00.300
I get all the free beer
I can drink.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.638
And you get to tell Adrianna
to get out of our house, okay?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.557
'Cause, hey,

21:06.599 --> 21:11.104
I got twins coming over later.

21:11.145 --> 21:14.190
NAOMI:
Come on. Come on. There we go.

21:14.232 --> 21:19.528
Come on, okay, okay,
yes, good boy.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.322
Come on, come on. No-no-no.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.366
No, I don't want you
here anymore than you
want to be here.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.035
Aw, you are just
like your daddy, aren't you?

21:26.077 --> 21:28.621
Not on my tile! Oh!

21:28.662 --> 21:31.082
Austin!

21:31.124 --> 21:34.127
Come on! Okay. Oh...
(Faulkner grunting)

21:40.549 --> 21:41.968
All right, Faulkner.

21:43.469 --> 21:44.762
Good pig.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.181
You like opera.

21:47.223 --> 21:48.933
Rossini, I believe it is.

21:50.392 --> 21:53.687
("William Tell Overture" plays)
(squealing)

21:53.729 --> 21:55.606
Oh, no, no, no, no!

21:55.648 --> 21:57.483
No, Faulkner!

21:58.818 --> 22:00.153
No, no!

22:00.194 --> 22:03.114
Stop! Wait! No! No!

22:12.706 --> 22:14.250
Don't get any ideas.

22:14.292 --> 22:17.086
I'm here for Navid.
It's about Leila.

22:17.128 --> 22:17.920
Is she still missing?

22:17.962 --> 22:19.588
Apparently, she's
been kidnapped.

22:19.630 --> 22:20.631
What?
Not that I believe that

22:20.673 --> 22:22.175
for a minute.

22:22.216 --> 22:25.803
But you seem to know
crazy, psycho behavior
better than I do.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.346
And you know who she
hangs out with, so...

22:28.388 --> 22:30.975
Maybe you can figure
out where she is.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.350
LEILA:
Navid.

22:32.392 --> 22:35.813
They want $50,000.
They say get the money ready,

22:35.855 --> 22:37.397
and don't go to the police...

22:39.441 --> 22:42.236
There's a reflection
in that glass table.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.656
Looks like a blue sky,
with, white puffy clouds.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.616
Do you remember that old
nail salon on Sunset

22:47.658 --> 22:49.785
that we used to go
to after school?

22:49.827 --> 22:51.996
What was it called?

22:52.038 --> 22:53.413
Marcy's.
Yeah.

22:53.455 --> 22:57.459
Yeah, we spent hours there.

22:57.501 --> 22:57.835
And the walls were
painted just like that,

22:57.877 --> 22:59.962
and I took Leila
there a few times.

23:00.004 --> 23:02.048
Oh, wait... they
went out of business.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.008
They went out of
business? No way.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.135
I know. Best French tips ever.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.678
For sure.
They were amazing.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.104
Silver, wait.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.523
What you said the other night,

23:19.565 --> 23:21.942
about feeling like you
wanted to end it all...

23:21.984 --> 23:25.988
I never knew that things
got that bad for you.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.491
And I can understand if
you can never forgive me.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.285
I'm glad you understand that.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.954
But if it is
any consolation,

23:33.996 --> 23:35.331
I felt so guilty

23:35.373 --> 23:37.666
about the things that I did,

23:37.708 --> 23:38.792
that I thought about it, too.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.840
Even if that's true,

23:44.882 --> 23:46.884
how am I supposed

I told Dixon

29:47.786 --> 29:50.122

29:50.163 --> 29:51.039
Thanks, anyway.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.501
Wait.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.462
I'm sorry.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.837

30:07.889 --> 30:08.890
Thanks.

30:12.102 --> 30:12.936
Let me ask you something.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.647
Why would you want to be
around a bunch of people

30:14.688 --> 30:17.399
who know you anyway?

30:17.441 --> 30:19.359
People who always...

30:19.401 --> 30:20.778
(sighs)

30:20.819 --> 30:24.114
...remind you of what you did.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.449
I don't know.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.992
I mean, I spent
the whole summer

30:27.033 --> 30:29.453
trying to forget
about what happened.

30:29.495 --> 30:30.412
I even went to Africa.

30:31.664 --> 30:33.165
And then I realized that I

30:33.206 --> 30:35.250
was really just running away.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.628
So I decided to stop
running and face my guilt.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.465
That probably doesn't
make any sense to you.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.554
ANNIE:
I had to make out
with Abe Lincoln,

30:47.596 --> 30:50.265
and then I had to
perform the Jabberwocky

30:50.307 --> 30:52.518
for a bunch of frat guys who
wouldn't stop laughing at me.

30:52.559 --> 30:55.521
And now you have to kiss me
when the bell tower rings.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.981
I don't know how stoked
I am that kissing me

30:58.023 --> 31:00.526
is your third
Trial of Fire.
(giggles)

31:00.567 --> 31:04.446
Okay, that's, uh, $7.75.
Thank you.

31:04.488 --> 31:05.322
Thank you.
Oh!

31:05.364 --> 31:06.699
And, by the way,
this is for last time.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.575
You really didn't have to.
No, I insist.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.494
See, I really do
carry a wallet like

31:10.536 --> 31:12.621
a respectable person.
Hm, good to know.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.707
Now I can tell my friend that
you're not a gold-digger.

31:14.748 --> 31:17.042
What's that all about?

31:17.083 --> 31:19.085
Nothing. I shouldn't
have said anything.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.547
Well, that would imply that
there's some gold to dig.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.006
Maybe I hit the jackpot.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.591
You have a rich uncle
or something?

31:24.633 --> 31:26.426
No. Not quite.

31:26.468 --> 31:29.221
Uh, she was a friend,
actually. Marla.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.348
She left me some
money when she passed.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.225
Oh, well, you guys must
have been really close.

31:33.266 --> 31:36.061
Yeah, we were.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.856
We actually didn't know
each other for that long.

31:38.897 --> 31:42.484
But when I met her, I found out
that she had Alzheimer's,

31:42.526 --> 31:46.196
and she was contemplating
committing suicide.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.281
So I wanted to show her

31:48.323 --> 31:50.409
why life was worth living.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.036
I thought I had gotten
through to her, but...

31:53.078 --> 31:54.621
she did it anyway.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.373
Annie, you can't blame yourself.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.584
It sounds like there was
way more going on than,

31:58.625 --> 31:59.668
than you could have ever known.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.879
Thanks.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.631
Feels good to just...
say it out loud sometimes.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.676
I'm glad you told me.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.304
(bell rings)

32:11.346 --> 32:15.058
Well, that is our cue.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.525
I'm officially a Kappa!
(chuckles)

32:23.567 --> 32:27.112
And by the way, you are a much
better kisser than Abe Lincoln.

32:27.153 --> 32:28.029
Thank you very much.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.367
♪ ♪

32:37.539 --> 32:39.416
She's gone?
She's gone.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.502
She's gone! She's gone!
Thank God.

32:42.544 --> 32:43.545
(laughing)

32:43.587 --> 32:44.546
I love you, man.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.005
I owe you one.

32:46.047 --> 32:49.635
Hey, it's okay. I just...
I just have to get busy.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.010
I have this meeting with
Juice Randall tomorrow

32:51.052 --> 32:52.554
and I only have two tracks done.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.390
I been staring at this freaking
computer program for hours.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.726
I'm gonna have to
pull an all-nighter,

32:57.768 --> 32:58.977
and I'm already
losing energy.

32:59.018 --> 33:00.437
Oh, yeah?

33:00.479 --> 33:02.856
That's no problem, man.
I can help you with that.

33:02.898 --> 33:06.276
I got my, uh, ADHD medication
in here somewhere.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.653
Here you go.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.071
I've been prescribed
it since I was a kid.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.365
You know, I just use it
to study now, but, uh,

33:12.407 --> 33:13.659
that'll keep you
alert and focused.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.743
Gee, thanks.

33:14.785 --> 33:18.538
Uh, but you know what,
I'm actually, uh, taking

33:18.580 --> 33:20.707
this other drug right now;
it's called enthusiasm.

33:20.749 --> 33:21.834
(chuckles)

33:21.875 --> 33:24.252
Suit yourself.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.545
Good luck.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.599
COACH:
Keep it tight!

33:37.641 --> 33:39.476
Keep it tight, guys!

33:39.518 --> 33:40.769
Let's go again.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.064
Since your QB's been
smoking doobies,

33:45.106 --> 33:47.192
you guys are gonna
have to work twice as hard

33:47.233 --> 33:48.485
to beat
the Bradleyville Panthers

33:48.527 --> 33:50.278
on Friday night.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.537
Condors suck!

33:58.578 --> 33:59.746
The Condors suck!

33:59.788 --> 34:00.789
It's the Panthers mascot.

34:00.831 --> 34:01.707
Condors suck!

34:01.748 --> 34:02.916
(players booing)

34:02.958 --> 34:04.835
The Condors suck!

34:04.877 --> 34:07.713
(screams)

34:07.754 --> 34:10.007
(gasping)

34:10.047 --> 34:12.592
That's the girl
that got me busted for pot.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.469
Let's get her!
Did I say the Condors?

34:14.511 --> 34:16.054
I meant the Panthers. They're
the worst football team ever.

34:16.094 --> 34:17.054
Everyone knows that.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.348
Oh, my God!

34:18.389 --> 34:21.100
HOLLY:
Bree, do you testify

34:21.141 --> 34:23.436
that Annie Wilson has completed
the three Trials of Fire?

34:23.478 --> 34:25.230
I so testify.

34:25.271 --> 34:28.859
Annie, with the lighting
of this candle,

34:28.900 --> 34:32.029
I welcome you into
Kappa Lambda Eta.

34:33.279 --> 34:36.574
May the light of sisterhood

34:36.616 --> 34:37.951
burn for all eternity.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.619
(chuckles)

34:39.661 --> 34:41.286
That concludes
our ceremony.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.873
But Naomi's not here.

34:42.915 --> 34:43.873
I know.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.208
I'm really disappointed.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.918
I had really high
hopes for her,

34:46.960 --> 34:48.168
but she didn't complete
her third trial.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.215
Yes, I did.
(panting)

34:52.257 --> 34:53.592
I did it.

34:53.632 --> 34:55.052
And I got it all on video.

34:56.844 --> 34:57.971
I'm in.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.138
I'm sorry, but you're not.

35:02.059 --> 35:03.142
What do you mean?

35:03.184 --> 35:05.186
(sighs)

35:05.228 --> 35:07.773
See, we've needed a
bigger house for years.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.274
We begged our parents
for donations,

35:09.315 --> 35:12.945
we sucked up to the alumni, we
finally got the national council

35:12.986 --> 35:14.738
to give us the
rest of the money,

35:14.780 --> 35:16.949
and the perfect house
came on the market.

35:16.990 --> 35:20.827
It was all ours, and then
you came along and stole it.

35:20.869 --> 35:21.828
You were the other bidder?

35:21.870 --> 35:24.247
You had the audacity
to throw a huge party

35:24.289 --> 35:25.874
the night we should've
been moving in.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.584
So you were the one
who called the cops.
Guilty.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.836
And you had me going through
hell, even though I never had

35:29.878 --> 35:31.755
a chance to get into Kappa?

35:31.797 --> 35:32.672
Yeah.

35:32.714 --> 35:33.757
You bitch.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.092
It was fun.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.218
Don't take it so hard, Naomi.

35:37.260 --> 35:40.305
Your house was perfect
for Kappa, but you never were.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.737
LEILA (sobbing):
I hate you!
Leila...

35:55.779 --> 35:59.532
"Back off, bro, before
I blind you with that needle."

35:59.574 --> 36:00.700
Got to say,

36:00.742 --> 36:02.619
kind of hot.

36:03.870 --> 36:04.997
I'm sorry, Silver.

36:05.038 --> 36:08.166
I was upset,
but I shouldn't have,

36:08.207 --> 36:09.709
shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

36:09.751 --> 36:12.462
I was upset, too.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.464
I could've been,
and I should've been,

36:14.506 --> 36:17.467
way more understanding.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.012
Can't believe you went
and talked to Ade.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.513
Yeah, well,

36:21.554 --> 36:23.306
maybe you were right.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.311
I've never really been
close with my family.

36:28.353 --> 36:31.940
My friends, they've always
been my-my family.

36:31.982 --> 36:34.526
And it was one thing
to lose Adrianna,

36:34.567 --> 36:39.698
but I... I can't stand
the thought of losing you, too.

36:39.739 --> 36:40.699
That's not gonna happen.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.119
LEILA:
I hate you, Navid!

36:44.161 --> 36:46.496
(pounding)

36:46.538 --> 36:48.665
Okay, well, I guess
she, uh, she found out

36:48.707 --> 36:50.083
that we nailed
the window shut.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.250
What are we
gonna do?

36:51.292 --> 36:52.418
(laughs)

36:52.460 --> 36:53.920
We can't keep her
locked up forever.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.172
Well...

36:55.213 --> 36:56.840
How am I gonna keep her
away from that guy?

36:56.882 --> 36:57.883
You're not.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.551
Look...

37:01.720 --> 37:03.930
She's your sister, you want
to protect her, I get it.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.892
But trying to come between
a teenage girl

37:06.933 --> 37:09.394
and the guy that she loves,
it's a no-win situation.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.437
Okay?

37:13.439 --> 37:14.566
Okay.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.409
(sighs)

37:30.331 --> 37:31.208
(keyboard plays)

37:31.249 --> 37:34.086
(groans)

37:34.127 --> 37:35.879
I'm so screwed.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.425
(sighs)

38:08.203 --> 38:09.370
Hey, hey.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.455
Excuse me. Hi.

38:10.496 --> 38:12.498
Uh, do you know if
Jeremy's around anywhere?

38:12.540 --> 38:13.875
Who's Jeremy?

38:13.917 --> 38:15.460
He's in Tau. He's one
of your brothers.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.170
There's no Jeremy in Tau.

38:17.212 --> 38:20.215
Oh. Uh, well, maybe I have
the wrong frat then.

38:20.257 --> 38:22.008
Thanks.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.344
Hey, cutie patootie.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.097
Hey. How's it going?

38:27.139 --> 38:28.640
Hmm, well, I spent
the entire morning

38:28.681 --> 38:30.058
apologizing to
Old Mrs. Rosen.

38:30.100 --> 38:33.019
Now I can get back to
doing what I do best.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.230
I'm planning revenge
on that bitch Holly.

38:35.272 --> 38:37.107
Oh. Yeah.

38:37.149 --> 38:38.316
About that.

38:38.357 --> 38:39.651
What she did was awful.

38:39.692 --> 38:40.652
I'm gonna go
drop out of Kappa.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.570
No. No, no, you're not.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.156
If I'm gonna destroy her,

38:44.197 --> 38:46.783
which I am,
I need someone on the inside.

38:46.825 --> 38:47.993
(cell phone ringing)

38:48.034 --> 38:48.910
I'm serious.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.036
I know you are.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.246
Oh, it's my lawyer.

38:51.288 --> 38:52.914
Hello.

38:52.956 --> 38:55.667
Oh okay, I'm on my way.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.002
Marla's family
wants to see me.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.837
Good. Go get your money!

38:58.878 --> 38:59.671
(laughs)

38:59.712 --> 39:01.422
I am so sad and lonely

39:01.464 --> 39:02.799
being the only one who's loaded.

39:09.639 --> 39:10.974
What do you want?

39:11.016 --> 39:11.975
Leave my sister alone.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.393
Why should I?

39:14.435 --> 39:15.020
We're in love.

39:15.061 --> 39:18.064
I'll have you arrested
for statutory rape.

39:18.106 --> 39:21.693
Oh, and I'm guessing a guy like
you already has a record. Right?

39:21.734 --> 39:22.861
Go for it.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.321
By the time
you do though,

39:24.362 --> 39:28.116
me and your sister
will be long gone.

39:28.158 --> 39:31.119
You will never
see her again.

39:31.161 --> 39:34.080
Look, buddy...

39:34.122 --> 39:38.043
I know you don't
love my sister, okay?

39:38.084 --> 39:39.961
What is it you really want?

39:40.003 --> 39:42.255
I would've settled
for 50 grand.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.925
But now that I know how
much you love your sister,

39:45.967 --> 39:47.844
I want 75.

39:55.852 --> 39:57.645
Hi.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.358
Jeremy?

40:03.735 --> 40:05.862
What are you doing here?

40:05.904 --> 40:07.405
I'm here to protect my family.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.656
Your family?

40:08.698 --> 40:10.367
You knew my grandmother
was suicidal

40:10.408 --> 40:12.035
and you didn't tell anyone.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.703
You're responsible
for her death,

40:13.745 --> 40:14.371
and I'm gonna make sure

40:14.412 --> 40:17.498
you don't get a penny
of the inheritance.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.298
So we're clear,
this is a loan.

40:25.340 --> 40:26.841
We're not going into
business together.

40:26.883 --> 40:27.884
Of course not.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.220
It's a loan.

40:30.262 --> 40:31.221
Thank you.

40:31.263 --> 40:33.265
To be honest,
after some of the things

40:33.306 --> 40:37.394
I said to you the other day,
I thought you might say no.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.353
We're family, Navid.

40:40.605 --> 40:42.607
And family should never say no.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.620
What are you

40:55.661 --> 40:59.124
You made it pretty clear you
never wanted to see me again.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.167
Yeah, I just needed
to tell you the truth.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.338
You are a reminder of

41:05.380 --> 41:09.467
But not just the accident.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.969
I was supposed
to be comforting

41:11.010 --> 41:14.139
my friend's wife...

41:14.180 --> 41:14.513
(sighs)

41:14.555 --> 41:17.350
Instead, I started
falling for her.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.768
God, I've been hating
myself ever since

41:18.810 --> 41:22.230
And I know that we can never
be together, and I just...
