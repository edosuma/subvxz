Hey, who's ready
for family movie night?

00:07.900 --> 00:09.008
Seriously? This is how
we're gonna spend

00:09.084 --> 00:10.825
our weekends from now on?

00:10.903 --> 00:13.904
Yep, this is
what ordinary families do,

00:13.906 --> 00:15.405
and now that we're
"The Mayhems,"

00:15.407 --> 00:17.241
we are an ordinary family.

00:17.243 --> 00:19.509
[all scream]

00:20.504 --> 00:21.511

a rat problem.

Oh, look, everybody.
It's our landlady Celia

00:39.265 --> 00:40.688

00:40.766 --> 00:43.867
[all] Hello, landlady Celia
and her granddaughter Hartley.

00:46.196 --> 00:47.537
Your first months
rent is ten bucks short.

00:49.124 --> 00:51.275
Oh, sorry about that.
Can you break a twenty?

00:51.277 --> 00:51.958
Nope.

00:54.704 --> 00:58.557
You look really familiar.
Do I know you from somewhere?

00:58.634 --> 00:58.724
[nervous chuckle]
No, I don't think so.

01:00.544 --> 01:05.472
-Well, we were just about to
start family movie night.
-Great.

01:05.549 --> 01:07.808
What are we watching?
I love a good war movie.

01:11.054 --> 01:12.720
Uh, on second thought,
we really should get some rest.

01:12.798 --> 01:15.065
We're still adjusting to the
time difference here in Texas.

01:16.393 --> 01:18.911
[all yawn]

01:18.987 --> 01:19.694
Remind me where
you're from again.

01:21.323 --> 01:22.030
[all] Tallahassee.
Delaware. Taiwan. Boston.

01:25.160 --> 01:28.328
We never... stay in
the same place too long.

01:28.405 --> 01:30.071
Well, that's a red flag.

01:30.149 --> 01:31.414
I'll take next month's
rent, too.

01:33.910 --> 01:35.986
You are gonna love Texas.

01:35.988 --> 01:37.712
-Everyone's super friendly.
-I can tell.

01:40.159 --> 01:41.992
What brought you here anyway?

01:41.994 --> 01:43.936
Oh, you know,
we just needed a change.

-Yeah,

01:56.024 --> 01:57.432
for someone who put it up
with their eyes closed.

01:57.509 --> 01:58.342
it's as straight as it's
gonna get.

01:58.344 --> 01:59.785
All right!

01:59.862 --> 02:01.695
Mom should be here soon

02:01.771 --> 02:02.788
and this promotion
is a big deal

02:02.865 --> 02:05.515
for our entire
supervillain family.

02:05.517 --> 02:06.366
What I'm trying to say is

02:07.019 --> 02:09.019
Ka-ching!

02:09.021 --> 02:09.628
Daddy's gonna buy
a getaway boat.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.541
Hey, what's wrong with you?

02:14.618 --> 02:16.451
I've been 13 for a month now

02:16.528 --> 02:17.544
and I still don't have my power.

02:17.621 --> 02:19.029
I mean, I don't even have
a villain name.

02:19.031 --> 02:21.131
My whole life, you guys
have called me "Number Three."

02:23.369 --> 02:24.718
Well, if it
makes you feel any better,

02:24.794 --> 02:25.886
we also call you other things.

02:25.962 --> 02:27.387
[laughs]

02:27.464 --> 02:29.873
Don't worry,
you'll get your power

02:29.875 --> 02:31.208
unless you're
some freak of nature.

02:31.210 --> 02:34.319
In which case, we'll still
tell you we love you.

02:34.396 --> 02:35.545
We'll just be
laughing behind your back.

What's wrong, honey?
Don't like the banner?

02:46.225 --> 02:47.833
I busted my butt

02:47.910 --> 02:50.560
to be Chief Commander
of the League of Villains

02:50.562 --> 02:54.656
and instead, Onyx promotes that
half-lizard freak Slither!

02:54.733 --> 02:56.008
Oh, I like her! She's--

02:56.084 --> 02:57.584
not nearly as good
at her job as you are!

03:00.239 --> 03:02.181
Don't worry, Mom, you'll get
'em next time!

03:02.257 --> 03:04.257
Oh, there won't be a next time.

03:04.334 --> 03:07.411
Because I'm gonna tell Onyx
that this family

03:07.413 --> 03:08.412
is<i>  done</i>  being villains!

03:08.414 --> 03:09.021
[all] What?!

03:10.582 --> 03:13.433
-Well, we have to get together
another night.
-Bye!

-Thank you for coming.
-Bye!

03:19.349 --> 03:20.607
Don't worry, Mom.

03:20.684 --> 03:22.534
Okay, I'm gonna fix this.

03:22.611 --> 03:23.276
I'm gonna find a way to get
our lives back.

03:23.353 --> 03:24.703
It's too late.

03:24.780 --> 03:28.856
All that's left now is to
settle into our mediocre lives

03:28.934 --> 03:30.267
here in the middle of nowhere

03:30.269 --> 03:32.878
and hope Onyx
and the other villains
don't find us.

03:32.955 --> 03:35.196
Don't forget about
the authorities.

03:35.274 --> 03:37.031
Or the superheroes.
They'd love to take us down.

03:37.109 --> 03:39.276
Yeah, what's their problem
with us anyway?

03:39.278 --> 03:41.127
I mean, aside from
wanting to take over the world

03:41.204 --> 03:42.888
and annihilate anyone
in our path...

03:42.965 --> 03:43.546

This is the fourth "F"
he's given me in two weeks!

Uh, well, maybe it's because

04:33.332 --> 04:34.273

to every question is:

"Can't read girl's test

help you here.

05:25.050 --> 05:26.658
To become a better person,

05:26.735 --> 05:27.567
you have to step out
of your comfort zone

05:27.644 --> 05:29.903
and do things you've never done.

05:29.979 --> 05:31.571
Like make a friend.

would I be friends with here?

No, no way. Not Hartley.

She's everything I despise.

05:46.071 --> 05:48.013
Exactly.

05:48.090 --> 05:49.589

challenge yourself

05:49.666 --> 05:50.682
to suppress
your bad instincts,

05:50.759 --> 05:52.166
which is why you should

05:52.244 --> 05:54.094
hang out with her after school.

never going to happen.

I mean, we live so close,

06:24.626 --> 06:26.459
we could hang out all the time.

06:26.536 --> 06:28.035
I'll see you at your house
after school...

06:28.113 --> 06:29.796

I never take you anywhere.

07:03.982 --> 07:07.484
Fine, I'll put it in the
secret lair in the basement.

07:07.486 --> 07:09.002
We don't have a basement.

07:09.078 --> 07:09.752
We do now.

07:13.341 --> 07:15.434
[gasps]

07:15.510 --> 07:18.178
Oh, can we just move down here
and not tell the kids?

07:18.254 --> 07:20.180
I was gonna move
down there and not tell you.

07:21.683 --> 07:24.276
Hey, how about I lock you
down there and I tell no one?

07:27.172 --> 07:27.937
Ooh.

07:29.933 --> 07:32.008
Did you buy a water cooler?

07:32.010 --> 07:33.343
No, I just assumed
you bought it.

07:33.345 --> 07:34.027

07:36.198 --> 07:38.439
Surprise!
I finally got my power.

07:38.517 --> 07:40.625

07:40.702 --> 07:42.535
Oh, I was more
excited about the water cooler.

07:45.023 --> 07:46.798
Wow, a shapeshifter
just like his grandpa,

07:46.875 --> 07:48.950
may he rest in peace.

07:49.027 --> 07:50.802
I mean, if he is dead.

07:50.879 --> 07:52.378
I'm pretty sure
he just shape-shifted

07:52.455 --> 07:52.712
into a coffin to avoid
grandma's nagging.

07:54.382 --> 07:56.475
And congrats, Colb.

07:56.551 --> 07:59.202
But remember, no using your
power outside the house ever.

07:59.204 --> 08:01.538
Well, I was hoping
we could use it

08:01.540 --> 08:03.223
to scare the pants
off the locals

08:03.299 --> 08:05.600
If we did that,
we'd be terrible role models.

I'm in.

be here any minute.

Oh, Jake,
this is a waste of time.

08:16.404 --> 08:18.388
I don't want friends.

you kicked your butt?

the whole world saw it.

08:27.899 --> 08:28.656
There's even a meme.

08:28.734 --> 08:29.415
What?!

08:31.920 --> 08:33.753
Who would even make
something like that?

08:33.830 --> 08:35.997
I did.

09:46.995 --> 09:49.329
<i>  I just want what</i>
<i>  every other girl wants.</i>

09:49.405 --> 09:50.830
<i>  Good friends,</i>
<i>  social media likes,</i>

09:50.907 --> 09:52.482
<i>  and for all of you</i>

09:52.484 --> 09:55.501
<i> to buy my new Starling light-up</i>
<i> high tops, in stores now.</i>

09:57.172 --> 09:59.264
Isn't she amazing?

09:59.341 --> 10:02.008
Not even Havoc's Sonic Scream
could take her down.

10:02.085 --> 10:03.827
Starling totally
kicked her butt.

10:03.829 --> 10:05.178
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
she didn't.

10:05.254 --> 10:08.348
-I'm pretty sure she did.
-I'm pretty sure she didn't.

10:08.424 --> 10:08.440
I'm pretty sure...

10:10.001 --> 10:12.593
I'm pretty sure you should
quit now before this gets ugly.

10:12.671 --> 10:13.928
Okay, Amy, why don't we go
make some popcorn?

10:14.005 --> 10:14.270
Oh, I'm gonna make
something pop.

10:16.191 --> 10:18.432
Amy, breathe,
Hartley is challenging you

10:18.510 --> 10:19.843
not to use your
villain instincts,

10:19.845 --> 10:20.443
and you're doing great.

10:22.530 --> 10:25.515
Ah! No. Give...

10:25.517 --> 10:26.607
me... the fork.

10:26.685 --> 10:28.034
Give me the fork!

10:32.207 --> 10:34.782
Uh, wait, didn't there used
to be a microwave over there?

10:34.860 --> 10:37.026
Oh yeah, Dad turned it
into that device

10:37.028 --> 10:37.802
that can zap people
into another dimension.

10:40.031 --> 10:41.973
Like really annoying
perky people.

10:42.050 --> 10:44.976
Amy, Amy!
Come back, Get back here.

10:45.053 --> 10:46.386
You've gotta see this
view of Havoc

10:46.462 --> 10:47.887
after Starling
kicked her butt.

10:47.964 --> 10:48.971
I saw the meme!

10:50.633 --> 10:51.933
Not this one. I just made it.

10:54.229 --> 10:55.654
-That's it!
-Amy, no!

10:55.730 --> 10:56.437
[grunts]

10:59.401 --> 11:02.218
[blows raspberry]

11:02.220 --> 11:04.812
Wow, Jake,
for a good person,

11:04.890 --> 11:05.830
you just did a really bad thing.
[chuckles]

11:09.318 --> 11:11.819
¶

11:11.897 --> 11:13.505
I just sent our neighbor
to another dimension.

11:13.581 --> 11:15.322
What are we gonna do?

11:15.400 --> 11:16.007
I say we rifle
through her closet.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.679
Hey! Say hello to our new dog.

11:20.755 --> 11:21.671
We figured he'd help us
to blend in.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.575
-Go ahead, pet him.
-I'm good.

11:25.577 --> 11:26.851
Oh, come on, pet him.

11:26.928 --> 11:28.344
-I don't wanna pet him.
-Will you just pet the dog?!

11:29.915 --> 11:30.596
Fine.

11:33.084 --> 11:35.176
Aw, he's gonna cute.
Who's a good boy?

11:35.253 --> 11:36.519
Who's a good boy--?
Ahhh!

11:37.923 --> 11:38.697
[all laugh]

11:40.683 --> 11:41.941
I love scaring children.

11:43.445 --> 11:44.852
I got my power.

11:44.930 --> 11:48.522
Oh, we've been using it to
mess with people all day.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.616
Oh, oh, and if you see
a news story

11:50.693 --> 11:52.359
about a bull
driving a golf cart,

11:52.437 --> 11:53.211
that was me!

11:56.866 --> 11:58.775
What is wrong with you people?

11:58.777 --> 11:59.041
We're supposed
to be blending in.

12:00.979 --> 12:02.703
He is right.

12:02.781 --> 12:04.705
Shame on you
for doing something

12:04.783 --> 12:04.881
that could expose our secret.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.392
Hey, Jake, what do you do today?

12:09.545 --> 12:12.213
Uh... Dad,

12:12.290 --> 12:13.973
we may have used your device

12:14.050 --> 12:16.559
to send Hartley
to another dimension.

12:18.129 --> 12:20.888
Oh, "we"? No, no.
That was all you.

12:20.966 --> 12:22.148
And it was delightful.

12:23.301 --> 12:24.892
[knocking on door]

12:24.970 --> 12:26.302
[Celia]
Hartley, you in there?

12:26.304 --> 12:27.236
It's Celia.
What are we gonna do?

12:30.399 --> 12:33.659
Really?! Way to have our backs.

12:33.736 --> 12:34.919
Shh. If we're quiet,
she'll go away.

12:39.909 --> 12:41.426
Oh, look. She has a key.

12:44.656 --> 12:46.747
Uh, hey, Celia.
We were just playing a game

12:46.825 --> 12:50.176
Uh, "Who could go the longest
without answering the door."

12:50.253 --> 12:51.010
That's a stupid game.

12:53.331 --> 12:54.998
Where's Hartley?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.423
She said she
was coming here,

12:56.501 --> 12:57.850
but she's not
answering her phone.

12:57.927 --> 13:01.020
Hartley--
I--I haven't seen Hartley,

13:01.097 --> 13:02.447
Amy, have you seen Hartley?

13:02.524 --> 13:03.523
Oh, come on!

13:07.270 --> 13:08.402
Okay.

13:21.117 --> 13:23.584
Wow, now this is what
I call a secret lair.

13:25.196 --> 13:29.140
-Were you ever tell
us about this place?
-Nope.

13:29.217 --> 13:31.384
But at least now we can all
use it as an escape from Jake.

13:31.460 --> 13:32.134
-There you are.
-[all groan]

13:34.297 --> 13:35.888
-Did you get rid of Celia?
-No.

13:35.965 --> 13:38.041
And if she finds
out Hartley's missing,

13:38.043 --> 13:39.133
she's gonna call the police

13:39.210 --> 13:40.043
and they're gonna start
asking questions

13:40.045 --> 13:42.803
and we'll be on the run again

13:42.881 --> 13:43.896
and I have a really big
Spanish test tomorrow

13:43.973 --> 13:45.639
that I wanna do
<i>  muy bueno</i>  on

13:45.717 --> 13:47.050
And that, kids,
is why we call Jake

13:47.052 --> 13:47.826
the dented can of the family.

13:50.055 --> 13:53.665
All right, look, this device
can only send people

13:53.741 --> 13:55.482
to another dimension,
but it's possible

13:55.560 --> 13:56.334
I could make a similar
device to send Hartley

13:56.411 --> 13:58.244
from the other dimension
to here.

13:58.321 --> 13:59.671
I would just need some time.

13:59.747 --> 14:00.746
Well, how do we stall Celia?

14:02.067 --> 14:03.675
Ooh. I have an idea.

14:06.071 --> 14:07.587
Stop sulking, Colby.

14:07.663 --> 14:10.506
At least you get to
use your shapeshifting power.

14:16.915 --> 14:18.356
I will never
forgive you for this.

14:20.009 --> 14:21.350
Yeah, yeah, add it to the list.
Come on.

14:27.592 --> 14:28.107
What's up, Celia?

14:29.777 --> 14:31.685
Excuse me?

14:31.763 --> 14:33.204
Where have you been?

14:33.281 --> 14:35.707
We're late for
your dentist appointment.

14:35.783 --> 14:36.766
[both]
Dentist appointment?

14:36.768 --> 14:38.543
She hates the dentist.

14:38.620 --> 14:39.377
Always trying to get out of it.
Let's go.

14:48.204 --> 14:49.445
Hartley, come on.

14:49.447 --> 14:50.613
Don't leave. No, stay.

14:50.615 --> 14:51.964
What are you doing?

14:52.041 --> 14:52.465
What are you doing?

14:54.619 --> 14:55.551
Hartley, get in the car.

14:57.288 --> 14:58.804
Wait!

14:58.881 --> 15:00.640
[stammers]
You can't go yet

15:00.716 --> 15:02.058
because there's
a problem in the house.

15:03.795 --> 15:04.727
The lights keep flickering.

15:06.055 --> 15:06.738
Not since I've been here.

15:08.133 --> 15:09.065
[electricity crackling]

15:11.653 --> 15:13.894
Aye, that's dangerous.

15:13.972 --> 15:15.413
Ooh. You should probably
fix that now.

15:17.492 --> 15:19.408
Hartley, go get my tool belt.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.424
Okay, the new device
is finished.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.834
Now we just have to
figure out

15:28.911 --> 15:29.585
which one of us
is going in to get her.

15:33.825 --> 15:36.159
Me? Why me?

15:36.161 --> 15:38.327
Come on! It'll be like
our villain days.

15:38.329 --> 15:39.829
I always pushed you first.

15:39.831 --> 15:41.422
You remember the volcano?

15:41.499 --> 15:42.848
You screamed
all the way down.

15:42.925 --> 15:45.610
Yeah it was a volcano.

15:45.687 --> 15:46.669
-That was the dumbest idea for
-Oh, come on...

15:46.671 --> 15:47.779
a Christmas card we've ever had.

15:47.855 --> 15:49.505
Ahh! I'll go!

15:49.507 --> 15:51.857
Even another dimension has
to be better than this place.

15:55.196 --> 15:57.438
Uh, Dad,
these devices are identical.

15:57.515 --> 15:58.790
Yup, I'm that good.

16:01.610 --> 16:02.702
So which is the new one?

16:07.192 --> 16:08.782
-You don't know?
-Of course, I know.

16:08.860 --> 16:09.542
That one.

16:10.862 --> 16:12.862
Are you sure?

16:12.864 --> 16:13.921
Yes, here. I'll approve it.

16:17.126 --> 16:18.551
Hop through the portal.

16:18.627 --> 16:19.719
Once you're in there,
count to two,

16:19.795 --> 16:22.371
hit the button,
you'll pop right back out.

16:22.373 --> 16:23.097
Okay, if you say so.

16:27.970 --> 16:30.229
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi...

16:33.885 --> 16:34.734
I really thought
that was the right one.

16:39.224 --> 16:40.164
Unbelievable.

16:40.241 --> 16:42.149
Oh, who am I kidding?

16:42.227 --> 16:43.075
It's my dad. Totally believable.

16:44.395 --> 16:45.077
Amy!

16:46.397 --> 16:48.339
What's going on?

16:48.416 --> 16:50.657
What is this place
and how did I get here?

16:50.735 --> 16:52.568
[laughs] Funny story.

16:52.570 --> 16:55.087
My dad's a scientist
and he created this device.

16:55.164 --> 16:56.589
It can send people
to another dimension,

16:56.665 --> 16:57.998
but it sent you here,
so I came to save you.

16:58.076 --> 16:59.500
but my dad gave me
the wrong device

16:59.577 --> 17:02.020
so now we're both stuck here
until he comes and saves us.

17:02.096 --> 17:03.354
[gasps] Whew! Is that an
inter-dimensional sunrise?

17:03.431 --> 17:03.846
Pretty, let's watch it.

17:06.434 --> 17:08.584
Amy, I don't want to be here.

17:08.586 --> 17:09.935
This place is creepy.

17:11.256 --> 17:13.013
Oh, it's not that bad.

17:13.091 --> 17:14.607
Aside from those giant
rocks flying towards us.

17:14.683 --> 17:15.316
Get down!

17:18.521 --> 17:20.613
Okay, now I really want
out of here.

17:20.689 --> 17:23.324
Don't worry, I'm sure
my dad will be here any minute.

17:25.286 --> 17:26.602
One of us has to
go in there and save them.

17:26.604 --> 17:27.328
I know, I know.

17:29.031 --> 17:29.663
You hungry?

17:33.202 --> 17:34.335
What is up with these rocks?

17:35.780 --> 17:36.629
Look out!

17:38.541 --> 17:39.465
-[gasps]
-That was close.

17:42.453 --> 17:43.135
Uh-oh.

17:45.139 --> 17:46.898
-Hartley, I can explain!
-That was a Sonic Blast.

17:48.217 --> 17:49.141
I knew you looked familiar.

17:50.795 --> 17:52.570
You're Havoc!

17:52.647 --> 17:53.905
Yeah, well,
that pretty much sums it up.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.058
That means your dad
isn't just some scientist,

17:58.136 --> 18:00.244
he's Craniac!

18:00.321 --> 18:02.080
You and your
entire villain family

18:02.156 --> 18:03.364
have been hiding out
of my grandma's house.

18:06.311 --> 18:06.367
What was that?

18:07.995 --> 18:10.329
I think I just figured out why
these rocks are flying around

18:10.406 --> 18:12.906
When we got zapped here,
it created a rift

18:12.984 --> 18:14.483
in the dimensional continuum

18:14.485 --> 18:15.501
and it's sucking everything in.

18:16.671 --> 18:18.412
What does that mean?

18:18.489 --> 18:19.913
Let's just say
it looks like you've

18:19.991 --> 18:20.923
attended your last
Sunshine Club meeting.

18:26.164 --> 18:28.272
[suspenseful music]

18:32.186 --> 18:34.094
Great, so not only did you
lie to me

18:34.172 --> 18:36.096
and sent me to
another dimension,

18:36.174 --> 18:38.098
now you're gonna get
me sucked into a black hole.

18:38.176 --> 18:40.451
-Oh, Hartley, so dramatic.
-[scoffs]

18:42.029 --> 18:43.788
I have every right to be.

18:43.865 --> 18:45.181
How could you not
tell me you're a villain?

18:45.183 --> 18:47.125
Well, aside from the
fact that we're on the run,

18:47.201 --> 18:50.519
it's not really the kind
of thing to share with people.

18:50.521 --> 18:51.370
You could have told me.

18:53.115 --> 18:54.857
I thought you
wanted to be my friend.

18:54.859 --> 18:56.876
Why would you betray me?

18:56.952 --> 18:57.635
Because I'm a villain.

18:59.530 --> 19:00.972
Maybe Amy on the outside,
but on the inside,

19:01.048 --> 19:01.881
I'm still Havoc.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.426
And the only person
I have ever cared about is me.

19:08.297 --> 19:10.306
Well, and my family.
That's why we're on the run.

19:11.709 --> 19:12.433
What do you mean?

19:13.878 --> 19:16.154
I guess since we're
about to be

19:16.230 --> 19:17.062
sucked into the sky,
I can tell you.

19:19.217 --> 19:20.883
Well, there won't be
a next time

19:20.885 --> 19:22.051
because I am
going to tell Onyx

19:22.053 --> 19:25.054
that this family
is done being villains.

19:25.056 --> 19:26.071
[all] What?

19:26.148 --> 19:28.666
No way,
we can't stop being villains.

19:28.743 --> 19:29.742
It's who we are.

19:29.818 --> 19:30.576
I'll talk to Onyx.

19:31.987 --> 19:33.078
¶

19:34.399 --> 19:36.507
-[Onyx] No.
-But my mom worked really hard.

19:36.584 --> 19:42.496
Your mother isn't worthy
of leading my evil legions.

19:42.573 --> 19:45.591
She can't even
lead her own family.

19:45.668 --> 19:48.244
That's why you were
defeated by Starling.

19:48.246 --> 19:49.687
You're all weak.

19:50.748 --> 19:52.748
I don't care who you are.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.692
No one calls my family weak.

19:55.770 --> 19:57.269
[screeching]

20:00.775 --> 20:02.425
[snarls]

20:02.427 --> 20:04.518
How dare you?

20:04.595 --> 20:05.778
[grunts]

20:07.098 --> 20:09.615
Destroy her and her family.

20:13.438 --> 20:14.620
-How did it go?
-Not good.

20:14.697 --> 20:16.047
Run!

20:16.123 --> 20:18.457
[all scream]

20:23.114 --> 20:25.706
-Wow.
-Yeah.

20:25.783 --> 20:27.541
I should have
just kept my mouth shut

20:27.618 --> 20:28.559
and none of this
would have happened.

20:28.636 --> 20:30.803
No! Standing up for your family

20:30.879 --> 20:33.064
is always the right thing to do.

20:33.140 --> 20:35.791
You know, you may be
Amy on the outside,

20:35.793 --> 20:38.461
but after hearing that,

20:38.463 --> 20:40.396
I actually gotta respect
the Havoc on the inside.

20:41.466 --> 20:42.073
Thanks.

20:48.097 --> 20:50.990
This is bad.
I wish Starling was here.

20:51.066 --> 20:52.533
-To save us?
-No, so she gets sucked in, too.

20:57.906 --> 20:58.580
[gasps] Look, it's Jake!

21:02.153 --> 21:04.336
Finally. You didn't
want to come, did you?

21:04.413 --> 21:04.837
Of course, not.
Dad pushed me in.

21:06.324 --> 21:06.839
Behind you!

21:12.254 --> 21:14.179
Well, way to go, Jake.

21:14.256 --> 21:15.606
Now she knows our secret.

21:22.690 --> 21:24.023
Found your tool belt, Grandma.

21:24.099 --> 21:25.274
I also found your crossbow?

21:27.345 --> 21:28.677
What's a woman your age
doing with a crossbow?

21:28.679 --> 21:30.904
You keep talking about
my age and you'll find out.

21:33.184 --> 21:33.958
I'll go check the fuse box.

21:35.686 --> 21:36.127
-No, no!
-Hartley, wait!

21:36.203 --> 21:37.128
Grandma!

21:37.204 --> 21:37.911
Hartley?

21:38.947 --> 21:40.022
Hartley?

21:40.024 --> 21:41.357
No, um...

21:41.359 --> 21:44.135
Flickering lights must have
messed with your eyes.

21:44.211 --> 21:45.303
That's...

21:45.379 --> 21:47.805
[electricity buzzes]

21:50.551 --> 21:51.717
Colby.

21:51.794 --> 21:52.476
Sup, Celia?

21:54.872 --> 21:56.972
Grandma! You will never
believe what just--

22:01.212 --> 22:02.394
You know what?
Never mind. I missed you.

22:04.473 --> 22:05.881
Miss me? You've been
here the whole time.

22:05.883 --> 22:06.157
I have?

22:07.552 --> 22:11.403
Here she goes again,
pretending she bumped her head

22:11.480 --> 22:12.330
so she doesn't have
to go to the dentist.

22:13.891 --> 22:16.000
Well, speaking of which,

22:16.077 --> 22:17.984
you should go.

22:18.062 --> 22:19.395
Well, what about
the flickering lights?

22:19.397 --> 22:20.896
I've grown used to it.

22:20.898 --> 22:21.455
Kind of like a disco.
[laughs]

22:23.918 --> 22:25.250
Hey! Wait.

22:27.738 --> 22:29.663
You didn't tell her
what happened.

22:29.740 --> 22:30.422
And risk her knowing the truth?

22:32.259 --> 22:32.966
I couldn't do that
to my friend.

22:34.579 --> 22:37.021
Look, you may be villains,

22:37.098 --> 22:38.522
but everyone deserves
a chance to be better.

22:40.251 --> 22:40.691
Your secret's safe with me.

22:42.753 --> 22:45.178
By the way, Jake,
you're in the clear.

22:45.256 --> 22:45.646
Amy's the one
who told me your secret.

22:46.849 --> 22:48.699
Gotta stay honest. See ya.

22:50.928 --> 22:52.027
You told her our secret?!

22:53.097 --> 22:54.930
[laughs]

22:54.932 --> 22:56.523
Who's the dented can now?

22:56.601 --> 22:57.324
[all] Still you.

23:02.773 --> 23:04.215
-What a day, huh?
-It certainly was.

23:05.793 --> 23:08.168
Are your parents still freaked
out that I know the secret?

23:14.042 --> 23:14.725
A little.

23:17.121 --> 23:19.546
It's crazy to think that if we
didn't go to another dimension,

23:19.624 --> 23:20.139
I might never know the truth.

23:21.626 --> 23:23.642
But now that I do,

23:23.719 --> 23:26.237
I guess we're
officially friends.

23:26.313 --> 23:28.814
Yeah. I guess we are.
Just don't tell Jake.

23:30.225 --> 23:30.908
I can't give him that victory.

23:32.895 --> 23:34.912
Okay.

23:34.989 --> 23:37.306
I know your life
is upside down right now,

23:37.308 --> 23:39.917
now, but maybe I can help
you just a little.

23:39.994 --> 23:41.577
You know, teach you not
to always be so bad.

23:43.071 --> 23:46.907
I couldn't be called that
as long as I can teach you

23:46.984 --> 23:47.374
not to always be so nice.

23:48.319 --> 23:49.710
I mean, you're a total doormat.

23:51.505 --> 23:52.463
And you're a sociopath.

23:55.159 --> 23:55.883
Then this should work out well.

23:57.178 --> 24:32.503
[both laugh]
