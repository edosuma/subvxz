WEBVTT

00:02.508 --> 00:04.276
- So...
- What?

00:05.953 --> 00:08.414
- What, Eddie?
- Did the dog eat my toe?

00:08.480 --> 00:11.161
No, the dog's not here.

00:12.151 --> 00:15.994
Good. That would have been fucked up.

00:16.018 --> 00:17.988
- You got a place where he can lie down?
- Couch.

00:18.013 --> 00:19.709
No. Goods wants you to
take him to your place.

00:19.734 --> 00:21.760
My place. So, wh... I'm a nurse now?

00:21.785 --> 00:24.447
I'm sorry, do you want to go up there
and wake him up and ask him yourself?

00:24.530 --> 00:26.265
- Go right ahead.
- All right.

00:26.332 --> 00:27.499
I'll be Nurse Jackie.

00:27.566 --> 00:28.835
Is it okay to put him in a car?

00:28.901 --> 00:30.903
Uh, he really shouldn't be moved.

00:33.072 --> 00:35.662
I guess it's okay if he
doesn't put any weight on it,

00:35.687 --> 00:36.701
and he doesn't hit it.

00:36.726 --> 00:39.407
- We got a shit load of stairs.
- For Christ's sake, Dennis.

00:39.432 --> 00:40.876
I'll carry him if you won't.

00:40.901 --> 00:41.980
No, I'm just sayin'.

00:42.005 --> 00:44.400
Better move him now before
the pain killers wear off.

00:44.425 --> 00:45.726
All right.

00:45.751 --> 00:48.617
Eddie, listen. You
gotta get goin', buddy.

00:48.642 --> 00:50.311
Come on, come on.

00:50.997 --> 00:52.531
Lean forward, man.

00:52.556 --> 00:56.055
Hey, uh, any idea how much this
is gonna take off what I owe Vince?

00:56.095 --> 00:58.003
I don't know, you're gonna
have to ask Vince, man.

00:58.028 --> 00:59.884
Yeah, I'll call him later.

00:59.909 --> 01:02.299
Just tell him I did a good job, okay?

01:03.617 --> 01:06.597
Uh, I... I'll bring the
car up front. Where is it?

01:06.622 --> 01:09.263
It's on... it's on Mott.

01:11.611 --> 01:13.201
Come on, lean over.

01:19.207 --> 01:20.715
What... what are you doing?

01:20.740 --> 01:22.074
What I should have done four days ago.

01:22.096 --> 01:23.764
What, burn down the building
with your brother inside?

01:23.831 --> 01:25.132
Diversion, next door.

01:25.199 --> 01:27.201
When the people come out,

01:27.267 --> 01:29.069
you'll shoot Vincent, anyone
that comes in your way.

01:29.136 --> 01:30.487
Ding, dong, the dick is dead.

01:30.512 --> 01:32.707
Yeah, but his monkeys are loyal, Marius.

01:32.773 --> 01:34.141
You'd be bleeding out
before you know it.

01:34.208 --> 01:35.876
He'll scope this out the
minute he smells smoke.

01:35.943 --> 01:37.778
- I'm not gonna stand around...
- Ugh!

01:37.845 --> 01:40.781
while that asshole
tears my brother apart.

01:40.806 --> 01:43.575
You want to help Eddie?
Get the fucking money.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.352
There is no money!

01:45.419 --> 01:46.887
The safe is empty!

01:50.980 --> 01:53.783
Now would be a good time to get goin'.

01:55.361 --> 01:57.732
Have you ever known
money to just disappear?

01:57.798 --> 01:59.734
It leaves a trace.

02:14.882 --> 02:16.416
How's he doin' in there?

02:16.483 --> 02:19.186
He's in shock.

02:19.253 --> 02:20.855
Listen, they're moving him to Richard's.

02:20.921 --> 02:23.292
Better cool off before they come.

02:28.462 --> 02:29.679
Hey.

02:32.132 --> 02:33.868
Go. Go!

02:33.942 --> 02:35.677
Don't touch the ground.

02:36.245 --> 02:37.400
Where's my car?

02:37.425 --> 02:38.806
I... I'm sorry, did you say...

02:38.864 --> 02:40.777
- Mulberry or Mott?
- I said it's on Mott.

02:40.802 --> 02:42.704
- Sorry.
- It's right around the corner.

02:54.388 --> 02:55.790
Get the money.

02:55.823 --> 02:57.191
I'll talk to Marjorie.

03:43.904 --> 03:48.688
Last night, I finally
told Pete what happened.

03:49.844 --> 03:52.112
Why we left.

03:52.179 --> 03:54.751
The look on his face,

03:55.315 --> 03:58.853
Lila, I don't believe
I've hurt that much

03:58.886 --> 04:03.560
since Mom told me how he
was on his 11th birthday.

04:04.491 --> 04:06.293
His 11th birthday?

04:13.615 --> 04:15.469
It's fine, it's... it's not...

04:15.535 --> 04:18.471
Hey, Pete. What are
you up to this morning?

04:18.538 --> 04:20.507
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no.

04:20.574 --> 04:22.442
Pete... Pete can't help you.

04:22.509 --> 04:25.412
- Why?
- He's manning the store with me.

04:25.479 --> 04:27.014
Do what?

04:27.081 --> 04:29.016
Julia wants somebody to go
with her to the doctor's.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.150
Jacob's getting a shot.

04:30.217 --> 04:31.885
Oh, he doesn't like the doctor?

04:31.886 --> 04:34.088
Oh, the little guy's fine, it's Julia.

04:34.154 --> 04:36.890
When she was four, she ran
from Dr. Rosen's office,

04:36.891 --> 04:38.725
Lila found her three blocks away.

04:38.792 --> 04:40.727
Taylor, have I told you lately

04:40.794 --> 04:42.897
just how much I look up to you?

04:42.963 --> 04:44.431
I wish I could help you, sis.

04:44.498 --> 04:46.433
It's always fun seeing
you in the waiting room

04:46.500 --> 04:48.268
sweating and shaking.

04:48.335 --> 04:49.703
I'll do it.

04:49.769 --> 04:52.529
What? You have school and you
don't even know what it is.

04:52.554 --> 04:56.090
Hey, family comes first. Whatever it is.

04:56.115 --> 04:58.117
Yeah, nice try.

04:58.578 --> 05:00.114
I have to check on a client.

05:00.180 --> 05:01.681
Think of it as a growth opportunity,

05:01.748 --> 05:03.984
facing your fears, and whatnot.

05:09.756 --> 05:10.925
Excuse me.

05:15.129 --> 05:16.931
I got the okay to fix my car.

05:16.997 --> 05:19.273
I'm gonna do the light at lunch.

05:21.601 --> 05:23.937
Well, I'm glad to hear
that your car is okay,

05:23.938 --> 05:25.331
but, uh...

05:26.941 --> 05:28.976
I'm wondering about you. Are you...

05:29.043 --> 05:30.777
are you suspended?

05:30.844 --> 05:32.146
Not so far.

05:32.212 --> 05:34.348
They got me ridin' the desk, though.

05:34.414 --> 05:37.817
And the detective exam is out
of the question this cycle.

05:37.952 --> 05:39.186
So, uh...

05:42.348 --> 05:44.191
Why do you look like
you've been in a fight?

05:44.258 --> 05:45.993
- We were wrestling and...
- Okay.

05:47.327 --> 05:49.196
We were playing football, and then it...

05:49.263 --> 05:51.109
And then it turned into wrestling.

05:51.134 --> 05:52.599
Only because you said I didn't tag you,

05:52.666 --> 05:55.444
and I... I, clearly, I did.

05:55.469 --> 05:57.371
Yeah, but who's... who's the
one who got the worst of it?

05:57.437 --> 05:58.572
Not me.

06:00.975 --> 06:02.842
I just can't wait until
at least one of you

06:02.867 --> 06:05.870
acts like you're not 12 years old.

06:08.715 --> 06:10.250
Yeah, I don't...

06:10.317 --> 06:12.252
I don't think she bought that.

06:12.319 --> 06:13.420
No way in hell she's gonna believe

06:13.487 --> 06:15.655
you got the better of me.

06:16.690 --> 06:18.636
Hey, uh, Jules.

06:19.593 --> 06:21.195
Do you, um...

06:21.261 --> 06:24.764
do you remember what happened
on Pete's 11th birthday?

06:24.831 --> 06:26.166
Where'd that come from?

06:26.233 --> 06:28.502
I've been reading the
letters that you gave me.

06:28.576 --> 06:32.647
Pete's mom said something
happened on his 11th birthday.

06:32.706 --> 06:34.608
It was a long time ago.

06:34.674 --> 06:36.476
One bit of good news.

06:36.543 --> 06:38.378
- The guy, the asshole who hit me...
- Yeah, yeah.

06:38.445 --> 06:39.913
- He's got a record.
- Uh-huh.

06:40.014 --> 06:41.548
I don't.

06:41.615 --> 06:43.183
You?

06:43.250 --> 06:44.918
Me?

06:45.019 --> 06:46.353
Look, I haven't seen you in 20 years,

06:46.420 --> 06:48.688
you could be out there, I don't know...

06:48.755 --> 06:50.657
robbin' banks.

06:50.724 --> 06:52.326
Not recently. No.

06:52.392 --> 06:54.461
Good. Good, in case you have to testify.

06:54.528 --> 06:55.628
Okay.

06:55.653 --> 06:58.043
And I don't want to sound like
I'm intimidating the witness,

06:58.068 --> 07:00.334
but if you say anything
other than he attacked me,

07:00.400 --> 07:03.437
- I'll fuckin' kill you.
- I know.

07:05.372 --> 07:07.411
Office has been draggin',
askin' about the video,

07:07.436 --> 07:08.675
so I'm gonna go by the bar after work,

07:08.742 --> 07:11.246
see if the city security
cameras got what happened.

07:11.271 --> 07:14.481
If I can get a video of
that fuck stabbin' my tire,

07:14.548 --> 07:16.383
- it'd be a big help.
- Yeah, it sure would.

07:16.450 --> 07:19.275
I remember one birthday,
there were tears.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.454
Of course, I wasn't there,

07:20.520 --> 07:22.822
- being the little kid they ignored.
- Was Taylor?

07:22.889 --> 07:25.659
Probably, but why
don't you just ask Pete?

07:25.725 --> 07:26.726
- Hey, Pete.
- No!

07:26.793 --> 07:27.827
Carly has something to ask you.

07:27.894 --> 07:29.496
I... I'm working on a surprise.

07:29.563 --> 07:32.065
- Yeah.
- Uh...

07:33.067 --> 07:35.602
I, uh... I was just gonna ask if, um...

07:35.669 --> 07:37.537
you could buy me some beer for a party.

07:40.998 --> 07:42.500
I'm joking.

07:42.542 --> 07:44.144
Jesus.

07:44.211 --> 07:45.745
Yeah, we need hard liquor.

07:48.597 --> 07:49.803
No.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.503
Hey. You lookin' for Marius?

08:09.569 --> 08:12.406
- I am.
- Brendon, remember?

08:14.741 --> 08:15.842
Is he still sick?

08:15.909 --> 08:17.311
Uh, no, he's, uh,

08:17.377 --> 08:20.180
he's in Poughkeepsie
at the builder's market.

08:20.247 --> 08:21.948
Waitin' on a shipment of tie backing.

08:22.407 --> 08:23.883
So, when will he be back?

08:24.202 --> 08:25.588
Uh, see, that's the thing.

08:25.613 --> 08:27.221
They said it was gonna
be ready this morning,

08:27.287 --> 08:29.080
now they're not until after lunch,

08:29.105 --> 08:32.792
so I would say he would
be here by around 3:00.

08:35.129 --> 08:37.131
I can't wait that long.

08:37.197 --> 08:38.365
Okay.

09:00.154 --> 09:01.288
Hey.

09:01.355 --> 09:03.357
- Hey, honey.
- What's up?

09:03.423 --> 09:07.294
So you know, I just covered
for your old boyfriend again.

09:07.996 --> 09:11.355
For the last fucking time. Okay?

09:17.671 --> 09:18.638
Asshole.

09:19.873 --> 09:22.176
Can you have it towed?

09:22.242 --> 09:24.244
The second the hour is up.

09:31.668 --> 09:33.370
Pete, get the lights.

09:50.704 --> 09:55.008
Uh, Pete and I lost a client yesterday.

09:55.209 --> 09:58.573
We wanted to make sure her
collateral was, um, secure,

09:58.598 --> 10:00.079
and I couldn't open the safe.

10:00.146 --> 10:02.115
Oh, I changed the
combination. Didn't I tell you?

10:02.140 --> 10:03.957
- No, you didn't.
- I'm sure I did.

10:03.982 --> 10:06.908
No. No. Why'd you have it changed?

10:06.933 --> 10:08.601
You worried about the Dockery bail?

10:08.668 --> 10:10.703
No, it's just good to
change it every now and then.

10:10.770 --> 10:13.205
Well, as long as the Dockery
money is safe, I don't give a shit.

10:13.272 --> 10:14.874
It's safe.

10:19.979 --> 10:23.382
I just don't understand why
you would change the combo,

10:23.450 --> 10:24.717
and not tell me about it.

10:24.742 --> 10:27.244
Apparently, you do give a shit.

10:27.269 --> 10:28.804
Pete, son,

10:28.955 --> 10:30.490
I think you should step outside,

10:30.557 --> 10:32.291
your grandmother and I
are gonna have a fight.

10:32.358 --> 10:34.427
You don't need to go anywhere,
we're not gonna have a fight.

10:34.494 --> 10:35.895
No, trust me on this.

10:39.952 --> 10:41.568
When did you have it changed?

10:41.634 --> 10:42.869
Six weeks ago.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.103
Why are you getting so upset...

10:58.941 --> 11:01.510
- Is that you?
- Sure is.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.082
And listen, if you're
tryin' to bail somebody out,

11:04.107 --> 11:05.948
don't bother with these
Bernhardt schmucks.

11:06.014 --> 11:09.385
To be honest, I'm surprised
they're still in business.

11:09.452 --> 11:12.788
Just call the number at
the bottom of our sign.

11:12.855 --> 11:15.800
Better yet, why don't I take you
around the corner to our shop.

11:15.825 --> 11:18.461
Hey, asshole, why don't
you move your goddamn truck.

11:18.527 --> 11:20.363
I'm talkin' to a customer, old man.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.679
It's not a customer, you idiot.

11:22.704 --> 11:23.999
That's my grandson.

11:24.066 --> 11:26.560
Wh... what?

11:26.585 --> 11:28.282
Pete?

11:29.137 --> 11:31.740
Pete Murphy? I can't believe it.

11:31.807 --> 11:34.009
- Yeah, just got back.
- No, no, no.

11:34.076 --> 11:36.445
I literally cannot believe it.

11:36.512 --> 11:38.280
Given what a little
fuckin' thug you were,

11:38.381 --> 11:41.469
I'm amazed you're not
in prison suckin' dick,

11:41.494 --> 11:43.456
because, let's be honest,
you developed a taste for it.

11:43.481 --> 11:44.937
Look, why don't you get
the fuck out of here.

11:44.962 --> 11:47.632
- I'll see you later, Pete.
- Get the fuck out of here.

11:47.657 --> 11:50.559
- Good guy!
- You shoulda picked a better photo.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.528
You can see your lazy eye.

11:54.262 --> 11:56.298
What the hell was that?

11:56.399 --> 11:58.300
Don't you remember him? That's Shawn.

11:58.401 --> 12:01.269
He's the kid that you
and Taylor made cry.

12:01.294 --> 12:03.629
Yeah. He's turned into a real prick.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.442
Real prick that's runnin'
us out of business.

12:15.008 --> 12:17.921
While Otto's off having
his hissy fit in private,

12:17.946 --> 12:20.288
I'm gonna go grab a taxi for my rounds.

12:20.313 --> 12:21.580
You man the fort.

12:21.757 --> 12:24.226
And if anything comes in you
can't handle, give me a call.

12:24.292 --> 12:25.661
I'll be back after lunch.

12:28.631 --> 12:30.776
Ever think about getting married,

12:30.801 --> 12:32.510
resist the temptation.

12:45.481 --> 12:47.082
Oh, perfect, I need an old book.

12:47.149 --> 12:48.316
You want anything?

12:48.341 --> 12:50.436
What, they got Manga?

12:50.786 --> 12:54.490
The Japanese comic books that no
grown man should expect to read

12:54.557 --> 12:56.191
without looking like a creep?

12:56.216 --> 12:58.160
I'll wait out here.

13:02.108 --> 13:03.963
I'll be right there.

13:09.237 --> 13:11.540
Can I help you find something?

13:11.607 --> 13:14.411
Yeah, I'm looking for a book.

13:17.705 --> 13:21.522
I don't know the author or the title.

13:21.605 --> 13:23.474
Do you know the genre?

13:23.944 --> 13:25.912
Just know it's about revenge.

13:27.636 --> 13:31.226
Right. Well, um...

13:31.293 --> 13:33.195
let's see what we can find.

13:42.905 --> 13:43.839
Yeah.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.874
Your P.O. went to the job site,

13:45.941 --> 13:47.510
and Brendon covered for you.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.211
Katie, Katie, I'm so sorry.

13:49.277 --> 13:51.714
- Thank you so much.
- No, no, no. No.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.949
See, I... I don't think
you're picking up on my tone.

13:54.016 --> 13:55.918
Okay? This shit has got to stop.

13:55.984 --> 13:57.920
Katie, it's four more days, okay?

13:57.986 --> 14:00.255
What the fuck was I thinking?

14:00.322 --> 14:03.258
Gas pedal's on the right, you idiot!

14:03.325 --> 14:06.695
- Look, by this time next week...
- You'll be what,

14:06.720 --> 14:08.427
gone from my life for good?

14:08.452 --> 14:10.666
You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:10.733 --> 14:13.368
No. No, you're not.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.871
Jesus, I forgot how
much I hate this shit.

14:15.938 --> 14:16.939
Oh, really?

14:17.005 --> 14:18.741
What's that supposed to mean?

14:18.807 --> 14:20.208
Well, it just seems to me like yesterday

14:20.275 --> 14:21.409
you were enjoying yourself.

14:21.544 --> 14:24.331
Yeah. 'Cause you were gonna pay me.

14:24.356 --> 14:25.981
Oh, really, is that all it is?

14:26.048 --> 14:27.950
You think I miss being in the game.

14:28.016 --> 14:30.352
Katie, you're so good
at it, I mean, come on.

14:30.418 --> 14:32.821
No, I do miss it. I do.

14:32.888 --> 14:35.057
Like an alcoholic misses a drink.

14:35.123 --> 14:36.825
Remembering the fun, forgetting it'll

14:36.892 --> 14:38.561
fucking kill you.

14:39.653 --> 14:40.896
Tough break.

14:43.025 --> 14:45.260
That's the problem with
following somebody who knows you,

14:45.285 --> 14:47.002
you can't get too close.

14:47.069 --> 14:49.471
Hell are you doin'
tailing your grandmother?

14:49.572 --> 14:51.840
- I could say the same thing for you.
- I say none of your business.

14:51.907 --> 14:54.710
No, I'm not just talking
about today, Otto.

14:54.777 --> 14:57.079
Two days ago, I was on
the rounds with Audrey,

14:57.145 --> 14:58.488
and I clocked you.

14:58.513 --> 15:00.314
- She spot me?
- She didn't say.

15:00.339 --> 15:02.074
I don't know.

15:02.284 --> 15:03.852
Otto.

15:03.919 --> 15:06.454
Otto, you want to tell
me what's goin' on here?

15:06.589 --> 15:07.990
No.

15:08.056 --> 15:09.391
No, I don't. I'm still gonna stick with

15:09.457 --> 15:11.226
it's none of your goddamn business.

15:11.293 --> 15:14.296
- And you don't have that option.
- All that money.

15:14.362 --> 15:17.800
She's saying it's there,
we both know it's not.

15:17.866 --> 15:19.835
It just... it just makes me think that

15:19.902 --> 15:22.971
my grandma's in some kind of trouble.

15:23.038 --> 15:24.840
And I'm just tryin'
to find out what kind.

15:24.907 --> 15:26.608
Does she know anybody in there?

15:26.609 --> 15:28.944
Not that I know of.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.646
Sometimes somebody knows
they're being followed,

15:30.713 --> 15:33.115
the go into a building
so they can skip out back.

15:33.181 --> 15:36.619
Leaving whosever tailing them
out front thumb up their ass.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.201
Come on, get in the truck.

15:38.226 --> 15:39.796
Come on!

15:41.023 --> 15:43.759
And I'm telling you I can't.

15:43.826 --> 15:46.261
I can take him back.
You can stay out here.

15:46.328 --> 15:47.996
I don't want him to be alone.

15:49.798 --> 15:51.977
Is there anyone you can call?

15:52.002 --> 15:53.371
Uh...

16:03.435 --> 16:04.713
What is it?

16:04.780 --> 16:05.948
What's what?

16:08.214 --> 16:09.642
- Come on.
- What?

16:09.667 --> 16:11.134
What is it?

16:17.633 --> 16:20.729
He tipped me. He fuckin' tipped me.

16:20.796 --> 16:22.495
Oh, you're still
whining about Mukherjee?

16:22.520 --> 16:23.923
Yes.

16:23.966 --> 16:25.698
What is it about him
that you hate so much?

16:25.723 --> 16:27.150
Huh.

16:27.992 --> 16:32.074
You know how he... he
always goes on about

16:32.140 --> 16:37.279
he came from nothin', and he
built an empire. It's bullshit.

16:37.345 --> 16:40.582
His father owned half the
communications in India.

16:40.683 --> 16:42.017
Half.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.888
Gave him the contracts to
Mumbai when he turned 18.

16:45.954 --> 16:49.291
The very definition of born on
third, thinks he hit a triple.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.863
Had silver spoons comin'
out of every orifice.

16:58.566 --> 17:00.235
I came from dirt.

17:03.205 --> 17:05.373
I put my 20 in on the force.

17:07.409 --> 17:09.044
Saved every penny.

17:11.127 --> 17:13.295
And I built this.

17:13.882 --> 17:17.152
I did this. This. This is mine.

17:20.222 --> 17:21.388
Okay.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.597
What? What's that now?

17:25.894 --> 17:29.197
I mean... I mean, I thought you were
gonna say that you hated Mukherjee

17:29.256 --> 17:31.458
because he cheated and we know
how you feel about cheaters.

17:31.533 --> 17:33.401
Wait, what? You think he's cheating?

17:33.468 --> 17:35.871
- I thought you did.
- Why would I think he's cheating?

17:35.938 --> 17:38.073
Well, the whole thing
that happened last night.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.242
I thought Hector saw
Mukherjee do something.

17:40.308 --> 17:42.978
Hector saw Mukherjee being
an asshole, that's all.

17:51.842 --> 17:54.056
He doesn't win that much.

17:55.350 --> 17:57.059
Well, not every night.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.830
But over time, he's
been ahead, way ahead.

18:06.039 --> 18:07.402
You see something?

18:07.469 --> 18:09.437
No, I wasn't at the table.

18:27.790 --> 18:30.525
Hi, this is just gonna take a second.

18:30.592 --> 18:32.194
You're gonna be okay.

18:32.260 --> 18:33.295
It's gonna be okay.

18:35.357 --> 18:37.132
Thanks for coming, but just
so we're absolutely clear...

18:37.199 --> 18:39.434
Yeah, I was your last choice. I got it.

18:39.501 --> 18:41.269
- Mm-hm.
- Nevertheless, I'm here.

18:43.976 --> 18:46.508
- And I will be in the hall.
- Okay.

18:49.177 --> 18:52.514
Okay, little man. It's
just gonna sting a little.

18:52.580 --> 18:55.117
- Then you're getting a lollypop.
- A sticker.

18:55.183 --> 18:57.452
You don't have lollypops?

18:57.519 --> 18:59.912
Got a whole bunch of stickers
for you to choose from.

18:59.937 --> 19:02.801
The dentist down the hall is
on a crusade, no lollypops.

19:02.826 --> 19:04.985
Yeah, 'cause that's the
cause of childhood obesity.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.228
Here we go.

19:18.941 --> 19:22.108
Sam was our skip tracer
until six weeks ago.

19:22.133 --> 19:23.987
Then he went to work for those assholes.

19:24.027 --> 19:25.562
It was also six weeks ago

19:25.613 --> 19:28.350
that your grandmother changed
the combination on the safe.

19:30.953 --> 19:32.187
You think he took the money?

19:32.254 --> 19:34.857
I don't think it was a coincidence.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.758
I overheard Audrey talking to him,

19:36.859 --> 19:39.461
sayin' that he owed her.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.498
Why doesn't she just go to the cops?

19:43.565 --> 19:45.767
Let's just say...

19:45.868 --> 19:49.771
the Dockery money is
not entirely kosher.

19:49.872 --> 19:54.009
We're supposed to report it
if we get cash as collateral.

19:54.076 --> 19:56.945
It's not the kind of
money that can be reported.

20:01.090 --> 20:02.792
- Shit.
- What?

20:03.503 --> 20:06.889
Bixby. He's a skip tracer.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.891
He's dumb as a knuckle, but he's...

20:08.957 --> 20:10.325
he's ferocious.

20:10.392 --> 20:13.328
Never leaves Sam's side
and that's a problem.

20:13.395 --> 20:15.830
I hate the way Sam walks.

20:15.898 --> 20:18.333
I want a piano to fall on him.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.936
- Who's that?
- That's Tony.

20:21.003 --> 20:22.404
He owns the joint.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.039
Good manicotti.

20:24.106 --> 20:26.341
Lasagna's made from frozen.

20:26.408 --> 20:28.610
That Grand Am, is that Sam's car?

20:28.676 --> 20:30.445
Yeah. Why?

20:30.512 --> 20:33.115
Uh, no, I'm just tryin' to
get a feel for, you know...

20:33.181 --> 20:34.516
Feel for who he is.

20:37.419 --> 20:39.654
He's got a nice watch.

20:39.721 --> 20:41.789
Oh, yeah.

20:41.856 --> 20:44.526
He never shuts up about that damn Rolex.

20:46.895 --> 20:48.763
- Hey, Grandpa.
- What?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.365
I got an idea.

20:55.938 --> 20:58.440
Hey, have that done by
the time I get back, okay?

21:12.754 --> 21:13.821
How you doin'?

21:13.956 --> 21:15.123
You got any Rolex?

21:15.190 --> 21:17.052
You gotta go to a store for that.

21:17.077 --> 21:21.129
Listen, my nephew, uh,
just graduated from college.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.330
I gotta get him a watch.

21:22.397 --> 21:24.299
Long story short, he's an asshole,

21:24.366 --> 21:26.268
so I don't want to get him a good Rolex.

21:26.334 --> 21:28.970
I don't even want to get him a
real Rolex, if you know what I mean.

21:28.971 --> 21:30.738
- You a cop?
- Am I a what?

21:30.805 --> 21:32.274
No. I'm not a cop.

21:32.340 --> 21:33.976
'Cause you know you
gotta say if you are.

21:34.009 --> 21:36.257
I'm pretty sure that's only for hookers.

21:36.781 --> 21:38.622
But no, I'm not a cop.

21:44.465 --> 21:46.454
I'll take the oyster.

21:46.521 --> 21:48.390
Hey, thanks.

21:48.456 --> 21:50.392
- For what?
- Showing up.

21:50.458 --> 21:51.626
You know, and paying for his daycare,

21:51.693 --> 21:53.828
and most of all for fainting.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.531
So good.

21:56.598 --> 21:57.865
You know, Google says that's called

21:58.000 --> 21:59.734
the parasympathetic response,

21:59.801 --> 22:01.336
and it is entirely involuntary.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.739
Wait, wait, you already knew about this?

22:04.806 --> 22:06.408
Well, I mean...

22:06.474 --> 22:08.581
I mean, I honestly didn't
think there'd be blood.

22:08.606 --> 22:10.012
That nurse is a butcher.

22:10.045 --> 22:11.679
I'm sorry, you knew this could happen,

22:11.746 --> 22:12.990
and you came anyway?

22:13.015 --> 22:14.116
Yeah, he's my kid.

22:14.182 --> 22:15.817
Oh, my God, you are such an idiot.

22:15.883 --> 22:18.342
- Okay, well, it's been nice...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:18.367 --> 22:19.549
Listen, I have a present for you.

22:19.574 --> 22:22.144
It's just like... kind of like
a-a-a little thank you thing.

22:22.169 --> 22:24.492
It's just, uh... let's
see if it happens again.

22:24.559 --> 22:26.528
Please? I missed it the first time.

22:26.594 --> 22:28.556
Ha, ha. You got a thing with the old...

22:28.581 --> 22:30.279
This is a pin and I'm holding it.

22:30.304 --> 22:31.699
- So, it's...
- This is not that...

22:31.766 --> 22:33.301
- No, come on, this is for science.
- It's not funny.

22:33.368 --> 22:35.037
- Oh, fuck science.
- It's for science.

22:42.377 --> 22:44.046
- Here for lunch?
- Yeah, just one.

22:44.079 --> 22:45.280
This way.

22:49.176 --> 22:51.745
The, uh... the lady at the
convention gave this place

22:51.819 --> 22:52.978
a very high recommendation.

22:53.003 --> 22:54.556
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

22:54.622 --> 22:56.180
Your server will be
right with you, okay?

22:56.205 --> 22:57.465
Sure. Okay.

23:07.114 --> 23:09.061
What did you do this time?

23:10.072 --> 23:11.239
Au contraire.

23:11.306 --> 23:14.331
This time I'm here of my own volition.

23:14.942 --> 23:18.180
When you use big words, I know
that you want something from me.

23:21.822 --> 23:24.224
Okay, I... I do want something from you,

23:24.249 --> 23:27.419
but it's not for me.

23:27.582 --> 23:29.050
It's for Pete.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.458
You know, I was thinking about

23:30.525 --> 23:33.261
all of the celebrations that he missed,

23:33.328 --> 23:35.926
and I thought we should
have a party for him.

23:35.951 --> 23:37.632
You know, for all his birthdays.

23:37.699 --> 23:39.601
You want me to dress up like a clown?

23:41.803 --> 23:43.738
There's a clear opportunity
for a joke there,

23:43.805 --> 23:46.641
but I'm going to demonstrate
my maturity by letting it pass.

23:46.708 --> 23:49.844
Oh, so you must not be
high. Congratulations.

23:49.979 --> 23:51.413
Look, how long is this gonna take?

23:51.479 --> 23:52.747
I need to get some work one.

23:52.814 --> 23:54.616
The only hitch is that...

23:54.682 --> 23:58.353
birthdays might be kind
of a sore spot for Pete.

23:58.420 --> 24:01.623
I was reading in these old
letters that Julia gave me

24:01.689 --> 24:03.525
about his 11th birthday.

24:03.591 --> 24:08.396
Sounded like a disaster, but
there was nothing specific.

24:08.423 --> 24:10.697
Do you remember what happened?

24:10.784 --> 24:12.451
I...

24:12.848 --> 24:14.958
I'm not... I'm not really good a this.

24:14.983 --> 24:16.552
Did you ask Grandpa?

24:17.506 --> 24:18.987
No.

24:19.341 --> 24:20.542
You don't remember?

24:20.608 --> 24:22.210
When you were a kid,
all the videos he took.

24:22.277 --> 24:25.357
He videoed, like, every
birthday since we were born.

24:30.563 --> 24:31.786
Is there a problem?

24:31.853 --> 24:33.488
Yeah, uh, I'm an idiot.

24:33.555 --> 24:36.023
I... I left my wallet on
the night stand at the hotel.

24:36.236 --> 24:38.052
I'm so sorry. I don't know what to do.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.806
Just call someone and
have them run it over.

24:39.831 --> 24:40.908
I don't... I'm here by myself.

24:40.933 --> 24:43.134
I'm here for the podiatrist convention.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.967
I mean, I could, you
know, what about this?

24:46.033 --> 24:47.769
I could, uh...

24:47.835 --> 24:51.773
Why don't you keep my
watch until I come back?

24:51.839 --> 24:54.075
- How much is it worth?
- I don't know, it was a gift,

24:54.176 --> 24:56.177
but, uh, it's a Rolex.

24:56.202 --> 24:58.513
Yeah, I think it's worth a
little bit more than the, uh...

24:58.580 --> 25:00.849
than the mean, no offense.

25:01.286 --> 25:03.055
All right, hurry.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.828
Thank you.

25:04.853 --> 25:06.488
Thank you.

25:06.788 --> 25:08.089
- I'll be right back.
- Hurry.

25:08.190 --> 25:09.624
Okay, okay.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.882
Who's your second?

25:18.734 --> 25:21.112
- What?
- Your partner.

25:22.109 --> 25:23.110
I don't know what you're...

25:23.135 --> 25:24.902
Come on, you're running a
fiddle con with the watch.

25:24.927 --> 25:26.241
I'm just wondering who got to spook Ben,

25:26.308 --> 25:28.676
say it's worth 50 grand?

25:28.735 --> 25:30.337
I don't know what
you're sayin', I don't...

25:30.412 --> 25:34.549
Look, Pete, I know who you are.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.050
Wait, how do you know my name?

25:36.117 --> 25:38.386
How is not important.
What's important is

25:38.453 --> 25:40.222
I know you and you don't know me,

25:40.288 --> 25:42.457
which means you're not
well suited for the life.

25:42.524 --> 25:44.226
So here's how it's gonna go.

25:44.292 --> 25:47.429
Go back in there, you
pay Tony for your meal,

25:47.495 --> 25:49.431
and you give him 100 besides.

25:49.497 --> 25:52.734
Or Bixby's gonna hold
you while I call the cops.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.952
What say you, Pete?

25:55.303 --> 25:56.610
You know what I say?

25:56.635 --> 25:57.872
I am gonna go back in there.

25:57.939 --> 25:59.758
I'm gonna go back in
there and call the police,

25:59.783 --> 26:02.652
because this is bullshit. This is...

26:02.677 --> 26:04.812
Hey. Hey, get him, he got my watch.

26:04.837 --> 26:07.105
Got my fuckin' watch!

26:09.116 --> 26:10.652
Move!

26:10.718 --> 26:12.792
Move!

26:12.817 --> 26:14.152
Move!

26:19.694 --> 26:21.329
Raise a fuss and I'll brain ya.

26:26.424 --> 26:27.825
Move!

26:27.850 --> 26:29.852
Okay. Okay. Okay.

26:29.885 --> 26:32.682
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay.

26:32.707 --> 26:35.109
- The watch.
- Okay. Yeah. Here you go.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.544
Okay.

26:38.882 --> 26:40.435
Met your grandson.

26:40.460 --> 26:42.283
Charming young man.

26:42.284 --> 26:44.352
At first I thought he
was running a short con,

26:44.419 --> 26:47.288
and then I thought he was
doing that as a distraction

26:47.289 --> 26:48.456
so he could lift my watch.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.592
Now I see he was just
wanting to make sure

26:50.658 --> 26:52.630
you and me got some alone time.

26:52.655 --> 26:53.685
That what you wanted?

26:53.710 --> 26:56.931
I want the 150k you stole from our safe.

26:56.998 --> 26:58.800
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:00.149 --> 27:01.403
You can break everything in here,

27:01.469 --> 27:02.804
I don't have your...

27:04.739 --> 27:07.643
Okay. Okay, okay! Jesus.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.638
I'm... I'll get it.

27:09.663 --> 27:10.878
I'm gettin' it.

27:15.688 --> 27:17.319
You have your hand on a gun?

27:17.352 --> 27:18.920
Two guns.

27:18.986 --> 27:20.609
Okay.

27:21.356 --> 27:22.457
Let's see if you can clear 'em

27:22.524 --> 27:24.325
before I cave in the side of your head.

27:24.326 --> 27:26.399
I can shoot right through the counter.

27:26.424 --> 27:27.729
Then do it.

27:29.697 --> 27:31.966
I don't have your money, Otto.

27:32.033 --> 27:33.335
Why should I believe you?

27:33.368 --> 27:35.337
'Cause you saved my fucking life.

27:35.370 --> 27:37.605
Which time? In the A Shau Valley,

27:37.672 --> 27:39.774
or 20 years ago when you
came lookin' for work?

27:39.841 --> 27:41.743
- The A Shau.
- Nice way you repay me,

27:41.809 --> 27:43.611
jumpin' ship to work for these assholes.

27:43.678 --> 27:46.347
I gave you 20 years of solid effort.

27:46.348 --> 27:47.515
That's not enough?

27:48.984 --> 27:51.287
They made me a better offer.

27:51.553 --> 27:53.455
Besides, the way the
business is going...

27:53.521 --> 27:55.657
It was a strategic decision?

27:56.716 --> 27:58.718
I get no weekends.

27:59.126 --> 28:04.287
I get higher pay, and I get
Bixby to do the rough stuff.

28:04.312 --> 28:08.828
I'm too old to take a bull...
or a baseball bat to the head.

28:09.170 --> 28:10.972
You know the story of this bat?

28:12.874 --> 28:16.010
Is it funny? I like funny stories.

28:16.077 --> 28:18.613
I think it's funny.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.616
I got this bat 30 years ago
before you came to join us.

28:21.683 --> 28:25.506
It was this French Canadian,
a defenseman for the Whalers.

28:25.531 --> 28:28.456
He was a goon, got into a
bar fight here in Bridgeport,

28:28.523 --> 28:29.891
so we bonded him out.

28:29.957 --> 28:33.127
For collateral, he brought
us his Stanley Cup ring

28:33.194 --> 28:35.397
from a stint with the Oilers.

28:35.732 --> 28:37.200
Never saw one before.

28:37.225 --> 28:39.423
Anyway, I was sure he'd
show up for his arraignment

28:39.448 --> 28:43.137
because... hell, it's a
Stanley Cup ring, right?

28:43.204 --> 28:44.472
But he ran.

28:44.539 --> 28:45.940
So I went after him.

28:46.007 --> 28:49.176
I went after him all the
way across the border into...

28:49.243 --> 28:51.513
Pay the fuck attention!

28:51.579 --> 28:53.715
I'm listening.

28:53.781 --> 28:56.250
I find him at his sister's house.

28:56.275 --> 28:58.140
And he comes at me with a hockey stick,

28:58.165 --> 29:00.922
and I see this bat and I grab it.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.557
I do the math.

29:02.624 --> 29:04.291
He's got a lot more
reach with a hockey stick

29:04.426 --> 29:05.560
than I do with this bat.

29:05.627 --> 29:08.429
So, huh, here's the funny part.

29:08.430 --> 29:10.798
You know what I did? I threw it at him.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.638
Are you fucking my wife?

29:19.943 --> 29:21.509
Is that why you're here?

29:21.576 --> 29:24.979
No, I'm not fucking your wife, Otto.

29:25.046 --> 29:26.681
And if you want to
know where the money is,

29:26.748 --> 29:28.483
you'd better ask her.

29:30.351 --> 29:34.843
I... I've been worried about
Audrey this past while, too.

29:34.868 --> 29:37.058
Something's wrong.

29:37.422 --> 29:38.858
If you need me to help...

29:38.924 --> 29:42.294
I need you to fuck
the fuck off, you fuck.

29:43.028 --> 29:46.031
She's my wife. I'll take care of it.

29:49.401 --> 29:53.511
Well, tell your grandson to
go pay Tony for his lunch.

29:53.536 --> 29:54.504
And here.

29:57.709 --> 29:59.979
Give him back his shitty watch.

30:01.516 --> 30:04.719
You can keep the bat. I bought
it at Herb's 10 minutes ago.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.312
Did he have the money?

30:14.267 --> 30:15.435
No.

30:55.167 --> 30:58.003
Hey, there he is.

30:59.939 --> 31:02.207
Easy, easy does it. Easy does it.

31:02.274 --> 31:04.543
I'm gonna get you.

31:07.474 --> 31:12.287
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

31:12.351 --> 31:17.082
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

31:17.107 --> 31:21.876
♪ Happy birthday, dear Pete ♪

31:21.901 --> 31:27.840
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

31:39.697 --> 31:41.231
Thanks.

31:41.256 --> 31:42.990
- Why the watch?
- What?

31:43.015 --> 31:44.617
Well,

31:44.896 --> 31:47.152
the way you separated
Sam from his muscle,

31:47.219 --> 31:49.288
any number of ways you
could have done that,

31:49.354 --> 31:52.666
but you chose to run a fiddle
con on him with the watch.

31:52.691 --> 31:56.695
Well, I knew Sam would...
wouldn't run, but Bixby would.

31:57.114 --> 31:59.116
But you knew how to lift the watch?

31:59.141 --> 32:00.900
I saw it on You Tube.

32:00.966 --> 32:02.333
So you don't know any cons?

32:02.358 --> 32:05.037
- What?
- Con artists.

32:05.104 --> 32:06.438
What are you getting at?

32:06.505 --> 32:08.908
I just was wondering if
it had something to do with

32:08.974 --> 32:10.575
why you haven't seen your
mother in three years.

32:10.642 --> 32:13.789
You don't know? I thought maybe you
would have been in touch with her.

32:13.814 --> 32:15.914
No, I wish. I wish.

32:15.915 --> 32:19.118
After you and your mom left,
Lila and Maggie wrote letters

32:19.184 --> 32:20.385
back and forth for a couple of months,

32:20.452 --> 32:22.387
and then your grandmother did, uh...

32:22.454 --> 32:23.722
well, you know what she did,

32:23.788 --> 32:25.678
and that was the end of the letters.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.218
I'm glad you're back, Pete.

32:28.243 --> 32:30.398
I am glad you're back.

32:30.465 --> 32:32.834
I never could have done what I did today

32:32.835 --> 32:35.417
with Taylor and Julia.

32:35.442 --> 32:37.405
And it really felt good.

32:37.472 --> 32:40.842
Gettin' a jump on Sam,
throwin' the bat at him.

32:42.109 --> 32:45.271
I felt like I was 30 again.

32:45.628 --> 32:47.475
Okay, 50.

32:49.337 --> 32:52.429
Anyway, it was really
good to be able to...

32:52.454 --> 32:54.256
feel like I could do something.

32:54.322 --> 32:56.567
- Is Grandma gonna be okay?
- Huh?

32:56.615 --> 32:59.907
Otto, the money in the safe.

32:59.932 --> 33:02.097
- When's the trial?
- Starts tomorrow.

33:02.351 --> 33:03.899
- Starts tomorrow.
- Yeah.

33:03.966 --> 33:06.401
- Start... How long does it go for?
- Couple of weeks.

33:06.468 --> 33:08.870
So, when it's over with,
what are you... what happens?

33:08.871 --> 33:10.372
You don't have to worry about that.

33:10.438 --> 33:12.640
I... look, I don't know much
about the bail bond business,

33:12.707 --> 33:16.044
but I'm thinkin' she could probably
go to jail for something like this.

33:16.111 --> 33:17.612
Your grandmother's not gonna go to jail,

33:17.679 --> 33:18.880
I will take care of it.

33:18.881 --> 33:20.582
Do you have any idea where the money is?

33:20.648 --> 33:24.152
- You have any clue?
- Hey, hey, Nancy Drew, let it go, huh?

33:24.219 --> 33:27.222
I will talk to your
grandmother about it tomorrow.

33:27.289 --> 33:29.357
I will talk to her
about it in the morning.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.959
Not tonight.

33:31.026 --> 33:33.328
Tonight, I am gonna be shit-faced.

33:37.381 --> 33:39.216
Ahhh.

33:43.405 --> 33:45.007
What did you do three years ago?

33:45.073 --> 33:47.309
Why do you keep asking
me about three years ago?

33:47.375 --> 33:49.244
Well, when you showed
up, we were on the porch,

33:49.311 --> 33:52.147
and you said you did
something three years ago,

33:52.214 --> 33:53.415
and your mother hasn't forgiven you.

33:53.481 --> 33:55.918
That's between me, my mother and, uh...

33:55.984 --> 33:57.986
I know, I don't want the details.

33:58.053 --> 34:00.239
I just want to know...

34:01.215 --> 34:03.091
How does this sit with you now,

34:03.158 --> 34:05.827
you feel okay about
it, you feel lousy...

34:05.928 --> 34:07.262
Well, it's stupid, that's all.

34:07.329 --> 34:08.295
It was stupid.

34:15.980 --> 34:18.882
I still think of you as a little kid.

34:18.908 --> 34:21.945
I know. I know. You're a grown man.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.918
Something I... I-I-I've
seen something...

34:29.944 --> 34:32.005
in the work.

34:33.021 --> 34:35.507
You bond a guy out...

34:35.533 --> 34:39.090
on a domestic, and, uh...

34:40.925 --> 34:43.405
Maybe he beats his wife.

34:44.299 --> 34:47.505
He's afraid that she's cheating on him.

34:47.610 --> 34:51.522
Thing is, she almost never is.

34:52.020 --> 34:53.789
But the guy,

34:54.476 --> 34:56.827
a couple of girls on the side,

34:58.668 --> 35:03.968
cheaters always think
they're being cheated.

35:04.503 --> 35:05.929
What?

35:06.755 --> 35:11.683
That's why I suspected
Sam and your grandmother.

35:12.229 --> 35:15.374
'Cause of something I did 13 years ago.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.319
When I was stupid.

35:42.915 --> 35:44.759
- Hi.
- Can you talk?

35:44.826 --> 35:45.927
I can.

35:46.028 --> 35:47.395
Thanks for getting my phone back to me,

35:47.462 --> 35:49.297
though I wish you'd done it in person.

35:49.364 --> 35:51.566
Didn't think that'd be too smart.

35:51.633 --> 35:53.501
Anybody at the station see you with it?

35:53.568 --> 35:56.671
Uh, my cousin, but he doesn't know you,

35:56.738 --> 35:58.040
or your phone.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.374
Can I see you tonight?

36:00.509 --> 36:01.677
I can't.

36:01.702 --> 36:03.069
Studying for the detective's?

36:03.478 --> 36:07.182
Uh, yeah, yeah. Besides, I'm...

36:07.249 --> 36:09.151
I'm looking at you right now.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.371
Are you following me?

36:12.396 --> 36:14.732
You gonna pull me over, officer?

36:14.757 --> 36:16.645
I'm looking at one of your billboards.

36:17.792 --> 36:20.061
I wish I had never agreed to do that.

36:20.462 --> 36:25.467
No. No, you look... God, you look great.

36:25.533 --> 36:27.635
You must be in a pretty
sketchy part of town

36:27.702 --> 36:29.071
to be seeing one of those.

36:29.137 --> 36:31.706
Are you studying for
the exam in a strip club?

36:31.773 --> 36:35.143
Nah, I... I, you know, I stopped
by Bruno's on the way home

36:35.210 --> 36:37.112
to get a drink.

36:37.179 --> 36:39.169
Sure we can't get together?

36:39.287 --> 36:40.454
Shawn's in Hartford.

36:40.479 --> 36:42.125
He opening up a new office?

36:42.150 --> 36:43.985
I have no idea.

36:44.086 --> 36:46.221
He said he won't be home until late.

36:47.822 --> 36:51.061
God, I wish I could.

36:51.426 --> 36:53.161
You're all I think about.

36:53.228 --> 36:55.097
You are all I think about, too.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.099
Drive safe, okay?

37:14.840 --> 37:16.141
You got a second?

37:16.166 --> 37:19.002
What, to teach you
how to pickpocket? No.

37:19.223 --> 37:23.855
You suck, but that's not actually
what I wanted to talk about.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.281
What is it?

37:25.993 --> 37:28.130
I need to talk about my period.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.622
That's funny.

37:35.647 --> 37:38.371
Uh, yeah, no, I actually, um...

37:38.404 --> 37:40.220
I've been reading these old letters

37:40.245 --> 37:43.414
between our mothers
after you guys took off.

37:45.988 --> 37:48.157
Really.

37:48.485 --> 37:49.653
Well, I'd like to see those.

37:49.678 --> 37:52.247
Yeah, they're amazing.

37:52.272 --> 37:54.507
No one in this family
ever wants to talk about

37:54.656 --> 37:56.428
the two dead plants in the room,

37:56.453 --> 37:58.059
AKA, my parents,

37:58.160 --> 38:00.562
so these letters are about all I've got.

38:00.628 --> 38:03.631
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I read in this one this thing,

38:03.698 --> 38:06.468
and I... I just want
to know if it's true.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.835
Yeah, you know, I don't really

38:07.902 --> 38:09.604
remember much from back then.

38:12.684 --> 38:14.909
Your 11th birthday.

38:14.976 --> 38:17.885
Our moms got really drunk...

38:17.910 --> 38:20.906
making the cake, and...

38:20.948 --> 38:24.135
When they brought it out,
apparently, my mom just, like,

38:24.160 --> 38:27.124
fell and went face first into the cake.

38:27.149 --> 38:31.120
And it just became this,
like, big food fight, and...

38:31.145 --> 38:34.296
Even Otto and Audrey joined in.

38:34.362 --> 38:35.630
Do you remember that?

38:37.667 --> 38:39.636
How could I forget?

38:39.815 --> 38:41.217
Memories of my mother being drunk

38:41.242 --> 38:42.543
are always the greatest.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.180
Thanks for reminding me.

39:00.310 --> 39:01.378
Wait a second.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.097
What do you want?

39:10.122 --> 39:13.874
Your husband and grandson
paid me a visit today.

39:13.899 --> 39:16.371
- What?
- Otto was asking about

39:16.438 --> 39:20.242
$150,000 that had gone
missing from your safe.

39:20.308 --> 39:21.943
Oh, fuck.

39:24.640 --> 39:27.310
You want to tell me what's going on?

39:30.424 --> 39:33.321
I think the real reason Otto came by

39:33.388 --> 39:35.757
was to ask if you and I were banging.

39:40.262 --> 39:41.563
What'd you say?

39:42.764 --> 39:44.862
What do you think I said?

39:46.283 --> 39:48.941
Oh, another thing.

39:49.933 --> 39:51.806
Your grandson's a crook.

39:51.873 --> 39:53.182
Why?

39:53.207 --> 39:56.711
Well, I thought he was
runnin' a short con badly,

39:56.778 --> 40:00.756
but it turns out he was runnin'
a distraction quite well.

40:00.781 --> 40:03.217
It doesn't mean he's a crook.

40:03.242 --> 40:05.728
Otto probably told him what to do.

40:05.753 --> 40:08.523
Otto teach him how to lift my watch?

40:38.453 --> 40:40.888
Sometimes somebody knows
they're being followed,

40:40.955 --> 40:43.658
they hop into a building
so they can skip out back,

40:43.725 --> 40:46.694
leaving the one who's
tailing them out front.

40:46.719 --> 40:48.788
With their thumb up their ass.

41:02.784 --> 41:03.852
How you doin'?

41:03.877 --> 41:05.179
Closing.

41:05.525 --> 41:07.327
Just had a quick question.

41:07.352 --> 41:09.521
Did a woman come in here today

41:09.546 --> 41:11.252
before lunch with a shopping bag?

41:11.353 --> 41:12.920
Closing. Out.

41:12.987 --> 41:15.723
- What if I was a customer?
- Are you?

41:15.790 --> 41:17.592
No, you are man with question.

41:18.826 --> 41:20.027
Hey, let me ask you something.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.366
How much would you give me for this?

41:27.402 --> 41:28.803
Okay.

41:28.870 --> 41:30.574
Oyster.

41:31.027 --> 41:33.207
It's worth 27.

41:33.274 --> 41:36.611
I could give you 20 if it
wasn't piece of shit fake.

41:36.678 --> 41:38.310
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

41:38.335 --> 41:39.847
That's me making jokes.

41:39.914 --> 41:42.295
Yeah, that's a fake? Are you sure?

41:42.320 --> 41:45.720
40 years I look at Rolex
on wrist of middle age man

41:45.787 --> 41:48.490
caught fucking waitress,
getting divorced,

41:48.556 --> 41:50.592
needs money to hide from wife.

41:50.658 --> 41:52.093
I know this shit backwards.

41:52.159 --> 41:53.461
Damnit.

41:53.528 --> 41:55.229
- How much you pay?
- Well, I didn't.

41:55.296 --> 41:57.855
I made a deal, but I thought I was
getting the better end of the deal.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.734
- Heh.
- That's the worst, isn't it?

41:59.801 --> 42:01.403
When you think you're the one playing,

42:01.469 --> 42:03.474
but you're actually
the one being played.

42:04.406 --> 42:06.596
How can you tell it's fake?

42:06.621 --> 42:08.223
There are ways.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.001
So, okay, for instance,

42:11.263 --> 42:13.681
that oyster there, is that real?

42:13.748 --> 42:15.247
Is real.

42:15.917 --> 42:18.453
- Are you sure?
- Fuck yes, I'm sure.

42:20.321 --> 42:23.358
Old days, you check weight.

42:23.383 --> 42:25.018
Fakes better now.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.313
The weight is good. Here.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.697
See? The same.

42:29.764 --> 42:31.457
Now, look at second hand.

42:31.482 --> 42:33.726
Rolex second hand moves smooth.

42:33.751 --> 42:36.019
Yours, little jerks.

42:36.044 --> 42:37.578
Coarse movement.

42:37.927 --> 42:40.029
Son of a bitch.

42:40.054 --> 42:41.643
I never would have noticed that.

42:41.709 --> 42:43.992
Put it down. Put fake away.

42:44.678 --> 42:47.146
Let me ask you about
that woman now, all right?

42:47.171 --> 42:48.450
Make it quick.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.552
My grandma, she's in a home.

42:50.618 --> 42:52.353
She says the nurse has
been stealing from her.

42:52.454 --> 42:55.289
She said she took something
and-and put it in a shopping bag,

42:55.356 --> 42:56.726
went off and pawned it.

42:56.751 --> 42:57.992
Pawned what?

42:58.059 --> 43:01.596
That's the thing. From one
minute, it's silverware,

43:01.663 --> 43:02.964
the next minute it... it's jewelry.

43:03.030 --> 43:05.500
I don't... her mind,
she... she goes in and out.

43:05.567 --> 43:06.768
As far as I know, it's bullshit,

43:06.834 --> 43:08.770
but, you know, I gotta check.

43:08.836 --> 43:11.473
No nurse today. Today,
regular customers.

43:11.877 --> 43:14.275
Well, there it is, she
lost her marbles then.

43:19.202 --> 43:20.838
That's not what you think.

43:20.956 --> 43:23.951
You like big dicks. So what?

43:24.018 --> 43:26.621
I don't like big dicks.
I don't like big dicks,

43:26.688 --> 43:29.410
that a sculpture of the
ancient Egyptian god Minh.

43:29.435 --> 43:31.991
- That's what I traded for the watch.
- A fake statue.

43:32.016 --> 43:34.018
Yeah, made in Chong
King three weeks ago.

43:34.061 --> 43:35.663
So you both get shit.

43:35.730 --> 43:37.364
Yeah, but I thought I was better.

43:37.499 --> 43:38.966
I was sure I was getting a real Rolex.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.668
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give me that.

43:40.735 --> 43:43.505
I don't want ancient Egypt
dick fingers touching that.

43:43.571 --> 43:46.040
Oh. Hey, what's your name?

43:46.107 --> 43:47.074
Gregor.

43:47.141 --> 43:49.043
Okay. All right. See ya.

43:49.110 --> 43:50.912
See you.

43:56.519 --> 43:59.353
So I look to my right, I see the clock.

43:59.420 --> 44:01.055
And the clock means?

44:01.122 --> 44:04.695
It means somebody's
running a con on Audrey.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.458
- You sure?
- Look I've run this con before.

44:07.483 --> 44:10.131
This is the part where
you milk the mark dry.

44:10.197 --> 44:11.999
You sure you're not just
seeing what you want to see?

44:12.066 --> 44:14.830
No, if it was just $150,000
gone missing from a safe,

44:14.855 --> 44:16.738
that'd be one thing, but she
pawned a piece of collateral.

44:16.804 --> 44:18.740
That's completely illegal.

44:18.806 --> 44:20.875
No, she... she's desperate.

44:20.942 --> 44:22.944
Well, you said they're on hard times.

44:23.010 --> 44:24.646
Hard times, you sell the farm.

44:24.712 --> 44:26.280
That's what you do with hard times.

44:26.347 --> 44:27.841
No, somebody's squeezing her.

44:27.866 --> 44:29.016
I just have to find out who,

44:29.083 --> 44:30.752
and then that's where
the money's gonna be.

44:30.795 --> 44:32.682
Do you have time to find out?

44:32.707 --> 44:34.556
In three days, Vince takes a finger.

44:34.622 --> 44:36.223
Okay, that's really helpful.

44:38.401 --> 44:39.668
Anyways,

44:39.894 --> 44:41.596
I saw Karolina again.

44:41.663 --> 44:43.931
- Yeah, I know, she came by.
- What'd she say?

44:43.998 --> 44:46.067
She said she stopped you
from getting yourself killed.

44:46.133 --> 44:47.234
Is she in?

44:47.301 --> 44:49.103
She's already started.

44:57.712 --> 45:00.074
Vince, if I saw anything,
I would tell you, I swear.

45:00.099 --> 45:01.583
Calm down, Tate.

45:01.649 --> 45:03.677
I'm not accusing you of anything.

45:03.702 --> 45:05.119
Been watching the hands?

45:05.186 --> 45:07.254
Watch all their hands like you told us.

45:07.575 --> 45:12.253
All right, so when you're watching
Ivy's hand or Hector's hand,

45:12.539 --> 45:14.596
who's watching our
little Indian friend here?

45:14.662 --> 45:16.731
He could be up to something, right?

45:16.798 --> 45:18.499
I... I mean, it's possible.

45:18.600 --> 45:21.435
I can watch closer next time.

45:21.502 --> 45:22.637
Really focus on this guy.

45:22.704 --> 45:24.238
All right.

45:25.372 --> 45:27.663
Tate, it goes without saying,

45:27.688 --> 45:29.310
you don't say anything to anybody, yeah?

45:29.677 --> 45:31.546
Of course not. Of course.

45:36.250 --> 45:40.121
Maybe we can get somebody
from the outside from a casino.

45:40.187 --> 45:41.288
That can spot cheats.

45:41.355 --> 45:44.650
Hm, what's he gonna wear, Eddie mask?

45:45.259 --> 45:47.261
Mr. Fuckerjee will sense
that something is up

45:47.328 --> 45:50.270
if he sees a new face watching over him.

45:50.497 --> 45:52.734
No, it's too bad.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.636
What's too bad?

45:54.710 --> 45:58.163
The only way to find out
if Mukherjee isn't cheating.

45:58.188 --> 45:59.923
Hm.

46:00.639 --> 46:02.109
You know what I thought
you were gonna say?

46:02.176 --> 46:05.362
- No.
- It's too bad that I can't use Eddie.

46:14.956 --> 46:17.825
You played for the Roughriders,

46:17.892 --> 46:20.194
and the Roughriders?

46:20.261 --> 46:23.364
They got two teams with the same name?

46:23.430 --> 46:25.328
It's Canada.

46:25.867 --> 46:27.702
I think they changed
one a few years back.

46:27.769 --> 46:30.437
Canada, huh?

46:30.504 --> 46:31.773
Must have been cold.

46:31.839 --> 46:34.175
Not during the season.

46:34.241 --> 46:36.343
Besides, I played four
years at Wisconsin,

46:36.410 --> 46:38.312
and that shit was cold.

46:38.379 --> 46:41.079
Walking to class in January.

46:41.104 --> 46:42.684
It's ugly.

46:47.321 --> 46:49.023
Taking this well.

46:49.090 --> 46:51.726
Getting my toe chopped off?

46:53.795 --> 46:57.932
If I'm not mistaken, I'm
pretty sure I screamed

46:57.999 --> 47:00.735
like a guy getting his
fucking toe chopped off.

47:00.802 --> 47:02.837
I mean after.

47:02.904 --> 47:04.605
After, I was on fuckin' Jupiter

47:04.706 --> 47:07.290
with all the pain meds you guys gave me.

47:07.712 --> 47:09.210
I thought your dog ate my toe.

47:09.276 --> 47:11.712
Okay then, since.

47:11.713 --> 47:13.748
You haven't bitched and moaned too much.

47:14.092 --> 47:16.127
Would it get my toe back?

47:25.492 --> 47:26.593
Yep.

47:26.728 --> 47:29.330
Yeah. Bring Eddie by tomorrow.

47:29.396 --> 47:30.732
Okay.

47:30.765 --> 47:33.534
And, uh, in the
meantime, treat him nice.

47:33.600 --> 47:34.969
Get him some ice cream,

47:35.036 --> 47:37.071
or a steak. Whatever he wants.

47:37.138 --> 47:39.756
Hookers and blow, anything.

47:47.639 --> 47:52.544
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

47:52.619 --> 47:57.191
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

47:57.266 --> 48:02.237

48:02.288 --> 48:07.060

48:07.134 --> 48:09.419
Ah, come on, Pete.

48:09.444 --> 48:10.629

48:10.654 --> 48:13.424
- Come on.
- Don't tell us what it is.

48:13.449 --> 48:16.377
Make a wish, Petey.

48:16.443 --> 48:17.845
Isn't it pretty?

48:17.912 --> 48:20.614
Eleven years old.

48:20.681 --> 48:22.917
Where's my mom?

48:22.984 --> 48:25.611
Oh, come on, make a wish.

48:26.520 --> 48:28.055
Pete, make a wish.

48:30.557 --> 48:33.995
Honey, turn it off. Turn it off.

48:53.047 --> 48:54.299
Who the hell are you?
nd of the deal.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.734
- Heh.
- That's the worst, isn't it?

41:59.801 --> 42:01.403
When you think you're the one playing,

42:01.469 --> 42:03.474
but you're actually
the one being played.

42:04.406 --> 42:06.596
How can you tell it's fake?

42:06.621 --> 42:08.223
There are ways.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.001
So, okay, for instance,

42:11.263 --> 42:13.681
that oyster there, is that real?

42:13.748 --> 42:15.247
Is real.

42:15.917 --> 42:18.453
- Are you sure?
- Fuck yes, I'm sure.

42:20.321 --> 42:23.358
Old days, you check weight.

42:23.383 --> 42:25.018
Fakes better now.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.313
The weight is good. Here.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.697
See? The same.

42:29.764 --> 42:31.457
Now, look at second hand.

42:31.482 --> 42:33.726
Rolex second hand moves smooth.

42:33.751 --> 42:36.019
Yours, little jerks.

42:36.044 --> 42:37.578
Coarse movement.

42:37.927 --> 42:40.029
Son of a bitch.

42:40.054 --> 42:41.643
I never would have noticed that.

42:41.709 --> 42:43.992
Put it down. Put fake away.

42:44.678 --> 42:47.146
Let me ask you about
that woman now, all right?

42:47.171 --> 42:48.450
Make it quick.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.552
My grandma, she's in a home.

42:50.618 --> 42:52.353
She says the nurse has
been stealing from her.

42:52.454 --> 42:55.289
She said she took something
and-and put it in a shopping bag,

42:55.356 --> 42:56.726
went off and pawned it.

42:56.751 --> 42:57.992
Pawned what?

42:58.059 --> 43:01.596
That's the thing. From one
minute, it's silverware,

43:01.663 --> 43:02.964
the next minute it... it's jewelry.

43:03.030 --> 43:05.500
I don't... her mind,
she... she goes in and out.

43:05.567 --> 43:06.768
As far as I know, it's bullshit,

43:06.834 --> 43:08.770
but, you know, I gotta check.

43:08.836 --> 43:11.473
No nurse today. Today,
regular customers.

43:11.877 --> 43:14.275
Well, there it is, she
lost her marbles then.

43:19.202 --> 43:20.838
That's not what you think.

43:20.956 --> 43:23.951
You like big dicks. So what?

43:24.018 --> 43:26.621
I don't like big dicks.
I don't like big dicks,

43:26.688 --> 43:29.410
that a sculpture of the
ancient Egyptian god Minh.

43:29.435 --> 43:31.991
- That's what I traded for the watch.
- A fake statue.

43:32.016 --> 43:34.018
Yeah, made in Chong
King three weeks ago.

43:34.061 --> 43:35.663
So you both get shit.

43:35.730 --> 43:37.364
Yeah, but I thought I was better.

43:37.499 --> 43:38.966
I was sure I was getting a real Rolex.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.668
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give me that.

43:40.735 --> 43:43.505
I don't want ancient Egypt
dick fingers touching that.

43:43.571 --> 43:46.040
Oh. Hey, what's your name?

43:46.107 --> 43:47.074
Gregor.

43:47.141 --> 43:49.043
Okay. All right. See ya.

43:49.110 --> 43:50.912
See you.

43:56.519 --> 43:59.353
So I look to my right, I see the clock.

43:59.420 --> 44:01.055
And the clock means?

44:01.122 --> 44:04.695
It means somebody's
running a con on Audrey.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.458
- You sure?
- Look I've run this con before.

44:07.483 --> 44:10.131
This is the part where
you milk the mark dry.

44:10.197 --> 44:11.999
You sure you're not just
seeing what you want to see?

44:12.066 --> 44:14.830
No, if it was just $150,000
gone missing from a safe,

44:14.855 --> 44:16.738
that'd be one thing, but she
pawned a piece of collateral.

44:16.804 --> 44:18.740
That's completely illegal.

44:18.806 --> 44:20.875
No, she... she's desperate.

44:20.942 --> 44:22.944
Well,

44:23.305 --> 44:29.240
