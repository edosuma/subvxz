<i>It could be tomorrow

01:14.533 --> 01:18.163
<i>When the sky takes the soul

01:18.328 --> 01:21.878

01:45.522 --> 01:49.197
<i>When my spirit just drives away</i>

01:49.359 --> 01:52.738
<i>With a faith of a bit of luck</i>

01:52.904 --> 01:56.499
<i>Or a half-tonne bomb
In the back of the truck</i>

01:58.994 --> 02:01.463
I think we just
went over something.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.875
There's something
caught in the tracks.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.884
What's going on?

02:06.043 --> 02:08.466
I think the lead vehicle's
got a mechanical.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.306
See if you can reach it.

02:18.472 --> 02:22.352

<i>When I'm on my knees
To the gates I'll stumble</i>

02:29.650 --> 02:33.780
<i>And plead my case
In a style that's humble</i>

Smell that, Davy?
That's the future.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.739
That's the brewery.
- What's up wi' you?

03:57.904 --> 04:01.408
It always feels weird coming back,
especially without Ronnie.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.794
We'll see Ronnie soon enough.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.922
We're home, Davy.
We've gotta enjoy it.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.542
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do now that we're out?

04:10.709 --> 04:13.883
Aye, loads.
Most of it involves your sister.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.390
- Ally, don't go getting carried away.
- I'm not getting carried away.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.471
You can't just expect her
to drop everything.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.638
- That's exactly what I expect her to do.
- Hey, right?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.777
- Something smells good.
- Did you get bread?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.312
Yeah.

04:41.740 --> 04:46.371
<i>I'm on my way

<i>I'm on my way

<i>I'm on my way</i>
<i>to what I want from this world</i>

04:59.049 --> 05:02.223
<i>And years from now
I'll make it to the next world</i>

05:02.385 --> 05:05.639
<i>And everything
that I receive up yonder</i>

05:05.806 --> 05:09.481
<i>Is what she gave to me
the day I wandered</i>

05:09.643 --> 05:14.023
<i>I took a right
I took a right a-turning yesterday</i>

05:14.189 --> 05:16.112
<i>- Uh-huh
- Uh-huh</i>

05:16.274 --> 05:20.780
<i>I took a right

05:20.946 --> 05:22.869
<i>Yay, yay, yay, yeah</i>

05:23.031 --> 05:26.706
<i>We took the road
that brought us to our home town</i>

05:26.868 --> 05:29.872
<i>We took the train
to streets that we could walk down</i>

05:30.038 --> 05:33.212
<i>We walked the streets
to find the one we've looked for</i>

05:33.375 --> 05:37.255
<i>We climbed the stairs
that led us to the front door</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:41.800
<i>And now that I don't
want for anything</i>

05:43.844 --> 05:46.723
<i>I'd have Al Jolson sing...</i>

05:46.888 --> 05:50.142
<i>'...I'm sitting on
top of the world!'</i>

05:52.978 --> 05:55.026
- Mum, have you seen my keys?
- No.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.862
- There's soup there. You want some?
- I haven't got time.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.867
You cannae go to work
on an empty stomach, Liz.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.745
- Mum, I'm late.
- Try getting up a bit earlier.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.202
- Can you not, Dad?
- Here.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.044
<i>I'm sitting on top of the world</i>

06:10.203 --> 06:13.298
- Oh, my God!
- Davy.

06:13.456 --> 06:17.461
What were you doing?
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.213
Are you good?

06:20.964 --> 06:23.262
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.178
They let us go early.
We thought we'd surprise you.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.143
- I was worried you'd be working.
- I am. I'm just out the door.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.274
I'm on lates this week.
Sorry.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.143
Hey, son.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.864
- Good to see you.
- You too, son, you too.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.405
- You hungry?
- Aye.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.741
- Sit down.
- Welcome home, Davy.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.531
- Thank you.
- Walk me to my bus.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.495
- OK.
- Come on.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.376
- I'll see you later, Mrs Henshaw.
- See you later, Ally.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.583
Good to have you both back.
Come here.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.215
Oh, Mum.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.674
So, you can let your
hair grow again.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.680
- I suppose I could, aye.
- There's nothing stopping you now.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.341
The world's your oyster.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.101
I hate oysters.
It's just snot in a shell.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.184
Right, I've got to go.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.934
See you.

07:21.274 --> 07:26.030
I'm not ready.
I had everything planned for the morn.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.539
Ma, it's all right.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.368
I even got this to put up.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.924
Steak pie.
I got a steak pie.

07:38.083 --> 07:41.303
It's still in the freezer.
It's never gonna defrost in time.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.182
I was sorry to hear about Ronnie.

07:50.345 --> 07:54.020
Could have been me, Dad.
Maybe should have been.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.899
It was my squad.
It was my responsibility.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.941
It was a roadside bomb. There was
nothing you could do about that.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.739
It's good to have you home.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.285
Look at you, my wee brother,
the war hero.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.754
Is this all right?
You did say.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.833
I'm gonna get back to work.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.088
- See you later.
- Great.

08:26.631 --> 08:30.352
We'll put wee Lewis in with Carol Ann.
You can share with Brendan.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.313
Don't worry. It won't be for long.
- Kids'll love it, won't youse?

08:33.339 --> 08:34.039
Yep.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.157
Having your Uncle Ally
to stay for a wee while.

08:37.183 --> 08:37.926
Yeah.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.982
- Are you a soldier?
- I am, yes.

08:41.145 --> 08:44.525
- You look fabulous.
- That's very kind of you. Thanks.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.943
You're welcome.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.576
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

08:49.738 --> 08:53.743
All right, grumpy.
Well, Ally and Davy turned up.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.127
- Really?
- Yeah. They got away early.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.793
Ally's just got back after
six months and you're here?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.674
Well, it's my job.
You'd do the same.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.177
Yeah, chance'd be a fine thing.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.386
- You still coming to Francine's do?
- Yeah, you know I am.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.176
Good. Very good.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.520
- Don't start.
- What?

09:14.679 --> 09:16.977
- Trying to set me up again.
- Come on. He wasn't that bad.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.610
Yeah, he was. He was weird.
He was a Scientologist.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.022
Well, I thought that meant
he worked in a lab.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.031
Came from one more like.

09:29.944 --> 09:33.073
- Ally, did you ever shoot anybody?
- What?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.832
Did you ever shoot anybody, Ally?

09:39.162 --> 09:40.755
Am I on the top bunk?

09:40.914 --> 09:44.714
I'm afraid you're on the bottom bunk.
I'm no use for it.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.050
OK.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.690
- Hiya, Harry.
- Oh, Jean.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.226
Big day today,
what with Davy coming back.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.737
He's already here. My boy's home.
He got away early.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.866
- That's lovely. You must be pleased.
- Aye.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.493
Right.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.531
Oh, Jean, maybe we could
meet at lunch, have a wee...

10:13.696 --> 10:16.370
- See you, Harry.
- ...celebration.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.332
- Morning, girls.
- Jean.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.917
I've got some great news.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.048
Straight through
to the Scottish Colourists.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.736
I'm sure your brother's lovely.
I'm just not up for small talk.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.156
I wouldn't worry about it.
He's not very chatty either.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.575
I've had a crap day and all I want
is a drink and a laugh.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.369
Yeah, and a drink and a laugh
is all it is.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.547
Now, you can talk or not.
He's not gonna be listening.

11:45.705 --> 11:49.209
He's just gonna be
staring at your tits.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.636
I'm not staying long.
One drink then I'm off.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.799
Well, don't tell me.
Tell your sister.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.763
She wants you to meet her pal.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.599
Another nutcase
from the nurses' home?

11:59.761 --> 12:02.640
- This one's different apparently.
- Different? How?

12:02.805 --> 12:07.606
Well, she's good-looking.
She stays out in Morningside.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
She's English.

12:12.023 --> 12:14.321
English?

12:16.319 --> 12:17.992
That's for you.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.202
You celebrating something?

12:20.365 --> 12:22.584
No, just fancy getting drunk.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.963
The thing with tequila, it's not what
you forget, it's what you remember.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.544
- Francine.
- No wonder you're still single.

12:29.707 --> 12:33.052
- Fran.
- Oh, thanks. Cheers, my dears.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.464
- You in?
- I'm in.

12:35.630 --> 12:36.973
Good.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.477
That's boggin'.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.014
Right, Lizzie, up.
Tell us one of your stories.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.023
- OK.
- Drunken storytelling?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.604
- No one's safe.
- OK.

12:48.309 --> 12:53.691
<i>This is the
story of our first teacher</i>

12:53.856 --> 12:55.403
You remember?

12:55.566 --> 12:58.115
<i>Shetland made her jumpers</i>

12:58.278 --> 13:02.909
<i>And the devil made her features</i>

13:04.409 --> 13:07.504
<i>Threw up her hands
when our mums said our names</i>

13:07.662 --> 13:10.586
- I've never seen her do this ever.
- You've never seen her do this?

13:11.332 --> 13:17.430
<i>Embroidered all her stories
with slanderous claims</i>

13:17.630 --> 13:19.132
Whoa!

<i>This is the story of
losing my virginity</i>

13:41.863 --> 13:45.037

14:16.814 --> 14:19.693
<i>They didn't leave the impression
that some people say</i>

14:25.323 --> 14:27.792
- Get over it, Liz.
- Yvonne, you get up. It's your turn.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.499
- I can't. What am I gonna say?
- You'll be fine.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.084
Just tell us anything.
Come on, everybody gets a turn.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.120
Francine, what are you doing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:52.285 --> 15:54.208
Don't let her do that to you.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.590
<i>It's over and done with
It's over and done with</i>

15:57.748 --> 16:00.752

<i>It's over and done with

16:19.770 --> 16:21.113
- Come on.
- What, you serious?

16:21.272 --> 16:23.445
Well, it's better
than the bottom bunk.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.165
The tequila helping?

16:32.533 --> 16:33.705
No, not really.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.249
OK.

16:46.589 --> 16:50.264
I used to come up here a lot.
It works every time.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.600
- How many girls is that, then?
- No, I mean it clears your head.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.516
All right, so it's not
some weird pick-up technique.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.650
What, midnight hill climbing?

16:58.809 --> 17:01.062
Do you think that would work?

17:01.229 --> 17:03.106
- No.
- No.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.489
Well, you're here.

17:04.648 --> 17:08.449
Must be the accent.
Sucker for a bit of the brogue.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.454
Och aye? What accent's that, then?

17:13.991 --> 17:15.789
Yeah, it's how I ended
up in Edinburgh.

17:15.952 --> 17:19.126
Met a guy who could roll his Rs,
followed him north.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.883
- What, you came all this way for love?
- I'd like to think so.

17:23.751 --> 17:27.381
It didn't last, though.
Nearly put me off Scottish men for good.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.639
How?

17:28.798 --> 17:31.972
Well, if you asked him
what he felt about us,

17:32.134 --> 17:34.512
then he literally
couldn't string two words together.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.102
But if you drove through
somewhere like Glen Coe,

17:37.265 --> 17:40.610
then he was singing folk songs
and crying like a baby.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.362
Aye, that's fair enough.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.946
I can understand why that would
ruin our reputation for you.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.907
Yeah. I used to think it was
something in the water up here.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.743
- Or the beer.
- It's not the beer.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.038
No, it starts way before
you reach drinking age.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.453
Yeah?

17:58.619 --> 18:01.418
It's somewhere in between
puberty and the pub.

18:04.500 --> 18:10.473
<i>When the inspiration
is above our station</i>

18:10.631 --> 18:16.434
<i>Thoughts are melancholy
and we let them pass</i>

18:18.097 --> 18:24.275
<i>We tend to view this nation
through the condensation</i>

18:24.437 --> 18:29.193
<i>On a dirty glass</i>

18:31.360 --> 18:37.242
<i>If misty eyes can witness</i>

18:37.408 --> 18:40.287
<i>Love and affection</i>

18:40.453 --> 18:43.377
<i>Love and affection</i>

18:43.539 --> 18:49.217
<i>Why does the heart still resist?</i>

18:49.378 --> 18:51.927
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

18:52.089 --> 18:56.094
<i>I've got eyes of misty blue</i>

18:58.429 --> 19:01.353
<i>All the things I want to do</i>

19:01.515 --> 19:07.568
<i>Are all I've ever wanted to</i>

20:31.522 --> 20:35.823
I was going through some
of Mum's stuff and I found this.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.779
Thought you might like it.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.079
I remember when this was taken.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.370
She left a few days after.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.538
I know.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.256
She got on the train.
I never saw her again.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.671
Never heard from her.
She didn't write.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.684
Didn't tell me about you.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.313
Well, she said it wasn't meant to be
between you two.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.812
I'm sorry.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.854
I promise you, I do not wanna
cause you any trouble.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.773
It's complicated, you know.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.408
- 24 years ago.
- Yeah.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.569
A long time.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.695
Whenever you're ready, madam.

21:21.721 --> 21:22.686
Thank you.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.871
There's room in the car if you'd
like to come to the cemetery.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.082
It wouldn't be a good idea.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.929
Well, I am around for a while,
if you fancy a coffee?

21:39.006 --> 21:41.680
Only if you want to.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.844
It was good to meet you.

22:00.236 --> 22:04.286
I'd just like to ask you a couple
of questions about your kitchen.

22:04.448 --> 22:08.043
I'm sorry. Apologies, ma'am.
My name's Davy Henshaw.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.539
I would like to speak to you
about kitchen appliances.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.777
You all right, mate?

22:41.944 --> 22:45.039
- Good you see you, mate.
- It's good to see you.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.451
- Where's Ally?
- He couldn't make it.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.666
His sister's got him watching
the kids after school or something.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.457
It's all right.
You don't have to cover for him.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.876
You know Ally. He took it hard.

22:57.042 --> 23:01.138
No. No. That's all the more reason
for him to come and say hello, then.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.846
- Aye.
- Some people can't handle it.

23:04.758 --> 23:08.558
My wee mum's OK, but my dad,
he just bangs on about the weather.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.433
What about you?
What are you doing with yourself?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.477
- Are you working?
- Aye, in a call centre.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.987
Bloody hell, man.
And I thought I had it bad.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.275
- It's just temporary.
- I thought you'd be army for life.

23:21.442 --> 23:22.989
It suited you, big guy.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.491
So, how's Rona?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.284
She's a woman.
Who knows?

23:32.161 --> 23:33.959
I suppose she's just
trying to be brave.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.964
I preferred it when she
used to just shout at me.

23:36.123 --> 23:40.970
- Is there anything I can do?
- You came, Davy. That's plenty.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.215
What you doing?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.510
It's this silver wedding
anniversary list.

23:47.676 --> 23:50.179
It's a wonder Mum's
put up with you that long.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.893
I was a catch, I'll let you know.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.479
Lucky she didn't
throw you back, then.

23:54.642 --> 23:57.486
No, it wasn't luck.
We just clicked.

23:57.645 --> 24:00.148
- We knew.
- How?

24:00.314 --> 24:03.409
How d'you know there wasn't
someone else out there for you?

24:05.778 --> 24:09.453
There was nobody else
out there for me, just your mum.

24:11.325 --> 24:14.829
My dad, all about the dreams
and the romance.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.963
I had my dreams.
I wanted your Mum,

24:17.122 --> 24:19.170
I wanted kids,
I wanted Hibs to win the league.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.882
- Is that all?
- Two out of three, not bad.

24:23.921 --> 24:27.471
Right, I'm off.
See you later.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.180
- Have a good night.
- See you, love.

24:29.343 --> 24:33.519
- Don't forget your keys this time.
- Thanks, Dad. I'm not five anymore.

24:36.809 --> 24:40.689
Davy's out tonight too.
Got the house to ourselves.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.448
Come on, give us a cuddle.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.790
I'm just thinking about
Mum and Dad's anniversary party.

24:54.952 --> 24:58.877
You know, 25 years. Makes your head
spin a wee bit, doesn't it?

24:59.039 --> 25:00.586
Yeah.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.132
I've been thinking about
that kind of stuff myself.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.296
You know, the future, 25 years.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.097
You can actually see yourself
that far ahead?

25:11.260 --> 25:13.479
Aye.

25:13.637 --> 25:16.891
- Doing what?
- Well, all the usual stuff.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.980
Working hard, bringing up a family.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.487
Going to see Hibs.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.148
Is that not what everybody wants?

25:24.314 --> 25:26.316
You sound like my dad.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.904
What's wrong with that?

25:33.157 --> 25:35.159
We're doing OK, aren't we?

25:36.952 --> 25:39.455
What?

25:39.621 --> 25:41.623
What you on about?

25:43.042 --> 25:45.044
'Course we are.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.422
Daft.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.388
I'd better go.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.775
<i>Please don't go</i>

25:59.933 --> 26:02.686
<i>Rushing by</i>

26:23.082 --> 26:25.835
<i>When you're with me</i>

26:26.001 --> 26:28.754
<i>You can tell it to the birds</i>

26:28.921 --> 26:32.221
<i>I'll tell the bees</i>

26:35.010 --> 26:40.392
<i>I can't do any more</i>

26:40.557 --> 26:46.109
<i>To get inside your door</i>

26:46.271 --> 26:52.324
<i>And I can't do any more</i>

26:52.486 --> 26:57.617
<i>Please let me inside your door</i>

26:57.783 --> 27:00.957

27:38.907 --> 27:40.909
Good night, Ally.

27:44.538 --> 27:47.337
<i>Please don't go</i>

27:47.499 --> 27:50.173
<i>Rushing by</i>

27:50.335 --> 27:54.385

27:58.302 --> 28:04.230
<i>Stay and make my heart ﬂy</i>

28:05.601 --> 28:06.693
Give me a ring.

28:06.852 --> 28:13.701
<i>Stay and make my heart ﬂy</i>

28:26.079 --> 28:27.922
I should get my bus.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.675
- We could get a cab.
- I can't afford a cab.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.929
- We could split it.
- That's noble of you.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.431
- I just wanna see you home safe.
- I have to get up early.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.728
If we leave now,
you'll still get five hours.

28:38.754 --> 28:39.869
Don't you mean six?

28:42.179 --> 28:44.853
Five and a half, final offer.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.643
Stay

28:47.809 --> 28:51.859
<i>And make my heart ﬂy</i>

28:52.022 --> 28:56.152
<i>Make my heart ﬂy</i>

28:57.319 --> 28:59.321
Better get you home safe, then.

29:04.701 --> 29:07.375
- Morningside, please, mate.
- Morningside it is.

29:07.537 --> 29:10.837
- Have you had a nice night, folks?
- We've had a lovely night.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.252
It's about to get a
whole lot better.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.420
Now, five and half hours.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.885
- Have you ever stayed up all night?
- No.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.050
No? Why not try it?

29:38.360 --> 29:39.907
All right, trouble?

29:40.070 --> 29:42.072
Yeah.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.377
Are you OK?

29:48.578 --> 29:50.580
I'm out with Mum today.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.841
- Yeah?
- And your lassie.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.515
It's your big night.
You want to look good.

29:59.673 --> 30:02.392
I'm just not sure
this place is me.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.428
Well, where do you want to go?

30:04.594 --> 30:07.017
I don't know.
Where do you normally go, Yvonne?

30:07.180 --> 30:09.683
- Glasgow.
- That's a bit desperate.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.478
It's a wonder you ever go anywhere.

30:13.645 --> 30:17.400
- I've been to plenty places.
- What, like Spain?

30:17.566 --> 30:20.365
Have you ever fancied seeing
somewhere a bit more exciting?

30:20.527 --> 30:23.280
What, like Glasgow?

30:23.447 --> 30:27.418
No, like China, or Brazil.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.874
I nearly went to India once.

30:30.037 --> 30:32.506
- Really?
- Yep.

30:32.664 --> 30:36.385
Couple of lasses I knew from art school
bought themselves a camper van.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.968
They were gonna drive there,
down through Europe,

30:40.130 --> 30:45.637
then Turkey, into Iran,
Afghanistan, Pakistan.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.601
They wanted me to go with them.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.858
So why didn't you?
It would have been amazing.

30:51.016 --> 30:54.020
Yeah, I thought about it.
I think I would have gone.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.405
But I'd just met your dad.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.237
You gave up the world for him.
That's so romantic.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.322
Bloody tragic if you ask me.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.162
Nobody's asking you.

31:05.030 --> 31:08.330
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go to Top Shop.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.588
- You all right?
- Yeah.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.222
Thanks for coming.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.704
- All right?
- Where have you been?

31:45.862 --> 31:49.116
I was in town. There was
something I had to pick up.

31:55.956 --> 31:58.709
- What's that?
- What?

31:59.418 --> 32:02.968
Davy.
I'm gonna propose to Liz.

32:06.675 --> 32:07.927
Bloody hell.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.471
I thought I'd do it
at your folks' silver wedding do.

32:10.637 --> 32:13.436
- Kind of appropriate, is it not?
- Yeah.

32:15.392 --> 32:17.065
Why not? Just go for it.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.198
- Bro.
- My man.

32:23.859 --> 32:27.739
Congratulations. Are you going down
on one knee? What you gonna say?

32:27.904 --> 32:31.784
Well, I hadn't thought about it.
I mean, something like...

32:31.950 --> 32:33.873
- 'You know how I feel about you.'
- Aye.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.753
'Do you wanna marry me?'

32:37.622 --> 32:40.171
- You cannae say that.
- Why no, Bronco.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.051
- You gotta keep it simple.
- There's simple.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.054
- But that's just brutal.
- What are you talking about?

32:46.756 --> 32:48.224
You gotta dress it up, man.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.977
- Aye, you lay the ground a bit.
- What?

32:51.136 --> 32:53.059
Look, I'm you, right?

32:53.221 --> 32:55.349
- Davy's your missus.
- What?

32:55.515 --> 32:57.017
Aye.

32:57.184 --> 33:01.985
<i>We've been going together</i>

33:03.273 --> 33:06.026
<i>Too long to be vague</i>

33:06.193 --> 33:10.369
<i>- When there's something to say</i>
- Whoa, whoa. All right.

33:10.530 --> 33:13.409
<i>If it's not now</i>

33:13.575 --> 33:15.873
<i>Then it's never</i>

33:16.036 --> 33:17.083
No way. I won't.

33:17.245 --> 33:20.124
<i>So I'll say it straight out</i>

33:20.290 --> 33:24.261
<i>'Cause I have no doubt</i>

33:24.419 --> 33:27.673
- Hey?
<i>- No doubt</i>

33:27.839 --> 33:30.012
<i>Let's get married</i>

33:30.175 --> 33:31.552
<i>I love you</i>

33:31.718 --> 33:34.813
<i>And I wanna stay with you</i>

33:34.971 --> 33:36.018
<i>Let's get married</i>

33:36.181 --> 33:40.687
<i>Have kids, grow old
and grey with you</i>

33:40.852 --> 33:43.480
<i>- Let's get married
- You make each other happy</i>

33:43.647 --> 33:46.571
<i>Oh, but you make each other blue</i>

33:46.733 --> 33:49.907
<i>- Let's get married
- It's just a piece of paper</i>

33:50.070 --> 33:53.040
<i>But it says 'I love you'</i>

33:53.198 --> 33:54.745
<i>For the good times</i>

33:54.908 --> 33:59.334
<i>For the days when we can do no wrong</i>

33:59.496 --> 34:00.918
<i>For the bad times</i>

34:01.081 --> 34:05.552
<i>For the moments
when we think we can't go on</i>

34:05.710 --> 34:06.836
<i>For the family</i>

34:07.003 --> 34:11.759
<i>For the lives of the children
that we've planned</i>

34:11.925 --> 34:14.599
<i>- Let's get married
- Come on, darling</i>

34:14.761 --> 34:15.933
<i>Please take my hand</i>

34:18.348 --> 34:21.226
<i>Oh, and I'll be the one</i>

34:21.393 --> 34:24.397
<i>Who's by your side</i>

34:24.563 --> 34:27.533
<i>Yeah, and I'll be the one</i>

34:27.690 --> 34:30.786
<i>Still taking pride</i>

34:30.944 --> 34:36.074
<i>When you're old if they ask me
How do I define success?</i>

34:36.241 --> 34:39.791
<i>Well, I'll say you find a woman
and you fall in love</i>

34:39.953 --> 34:43.172
<i>And you ask her and she says yes</i>

34:43.331 --> 34:46.335
<i>You ask her and she says yes</i>

34:46.501 --> 34:47.969
<i>Let's get married</i>

34:48.128 --> 34:49.344
<i>I love you</i>

34:49.504 --> 34:52.553
<i>And I wanna stay with you</i>

34:52.716 --> 34:54.342
<i>Let's get married</i>

34:54.509 --> 34:55.761
<i>Have kids</i>

34:55.927 --> 34:58.646
<i>Grow old and grey with you</i>

34:58.805 --> 34:59.977
<i>Let's get married</i>

35:00.140 --> 35:02.063
<i>Hold hands</i>

35:02.225 --> 35:05.024
<i>When we walk in the park</i>

35:05.186 --> 35:08.656
<i>- Let's get married
- All right, you can have a cat</i>

35:08.815 --> 35:11.113
<i>Just as long as it barks</i>

35:11.276 --> 35:12.653
<i>For the good times</i>

35:12.819 --> 35:17.325
<i>For the days when we can do no wrong</i>

35:17.490 --> 35:18.912
<i>For the bad times</i>

35:19.075 --> 35:23.501
<i>For the moments
when we think we can't go on</i>

35:23.663 --> 35:25.757
<i>For the family</i>

35:25.915 --> 35:29.294
<i>For the lives of the children
that we've planned</i>

35:29.461 --> 35:32.180
<i>- Let's get married
- Come on, darling</i>

35:32.339 --> 35:33.761
<i>Please take my hand</i>

35:33.923 --> 35:35.175
<i>Come on, darling</i>

35:35.342 --> 35:36.389
<i>Please take my hand</i>

35:36.551 --> 35:40.055
<i>Come on, darling
Please take my hand</i>

35:40.221 --> 35:43.065
<i>Come on, darling
Please take my hand</i>

35:43.224 --> 35:46.148
<i>Come on, darling
Please take my hand</i>

35:46.311 --> 35:49.281
<i>Come on, darling
Please take my hand</i>

35:49.439 --> 35:52.488
<i>Come on, darling
Please take my hand</i>

35:52.651 --> 35:55.495
<i>Come on, darling
Please take my hand</i>

35:55.654 --> 35:59.079
<i>Come on, darling
Please take my hand</i>

35:59.240 --> 36:01.368
Whoa!

36:02.452 --> 36:04.454
All right, drinks are on the house.

36:12.671 --> 36:16.392
<i>When I was a younger man</i>

36:19.928 --> 36:23.273
<i>When I was a silly boy</i>

36:25.725 --> 36:28.569
<i>I didn't need a thing</i>

36:28.728 --> 36:31.698
<i>I was strong as anything</i>

36:31.856 --> 36:36.578
<i>I viewed solitude as a joy</i>

36:39.614 --> 36:42.834
<i>I wanna spend my life with you</i>

36:46.746 --> 36:50.125
<i>Don't wanna live all alone</i>

36:53.586 --> 36:58.843
<i>I can't conceive
of the years left to me</i>

37:01.010 --> 37:04.014
<i>Without you in our home</i>

37:15.859 --> 37:19.454
I wanna thank everybody
for coming here today.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.330
I know some of you
have travelled far

37:21.489 --> 37:24.618
and we really appreciate the effort
you've made to get here.

37:26.828 --> 37:29.672
I think we all know
who we're here to celebrate.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.674
My beautiful wife, Jean.

37:40.300 --> 37:44.931
25 years ago
a priest asked her that question,

37:45.096 --> 37:48.020
and Jean had her answer ready.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.230
After 25 years of marriage,

37:50.393 --> 37:53.067
I can assure you
she always has an answer ready.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.153
He's a bit slow. He'll learn.

38:02.197 --> 38:05.792
But I really do wanna thank her

38:05.950 --> 38:09.500
for taking a chance on me
all those years ago.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.754
<i>I've never been lucky
with girls, I confess</i>

38:13.917 --> 38:17.217
<i>Don't know who to blame
for my lack of success</i>

38:17.378 --> 38:21.133
<i>'Cause even the ones
at the back of a bus</i>

38:21.299 --> 38:23.643
<i>There was always a risk
of a slap in the pus</i>

38:25.553 --> 38:27.555
<i>But...</i>

38:28.807 --> 38:31.651
<i>Jean, Oh, Jean</i>

38:31.810 --> 38:34.939
<i>You let me get lucky wi' you</i>

38:36.356 --> 38:40.111
<i>Jean, Oh, Jean</i>

38:40.276 --> 38:42.904
<i>You let me get lucky with you</i>

38:44.113 --> 38:47.708
<i>First time I met her
it did cross my mind</i>

38:47.867 --> 38:51.667
<i>Next time I saw her
I hadnae the time</i>

38:51.830 --> 38:55.255
<i>Third time I saw her
I thought that I should</i>

38:55.416 --> 38:58.044
<i>Fourth time I met her
I knew that I would</i>

38:58.670 --> 39:02.766
<i>'Cause, Jean, Oh, Jean</i>

39:02.924 --> 39:05.768
<i>You let me get lucky wi' you</i>

39:06.761 --> 39:10.015
<i>'Cause, Jean, Oh, Jean</i>

39:10.557 --> 39:13.686
<i>You let me get lucky with you</i>

39:14.602 --> 39:18.402
<i>I love her, I love her, I love her</i>

39:18.565 --> 39:22.035
<i>Love her, I love her, I love her</i>

39:22.193 --> 39:26.039
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

39:26.197 --> 39:29.576
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

39:29.742 --> 39:33.497
<i>He wants you forever
He wants you for good</i>

39:33.663 --> 39:37.668
<i>So he's gonna treat you
the way that he should</i>

39:37.834 --> 39:41.384
<i>For your soul and body
My heart's gonnae pound</i>

39:41.546 --> 39:45.267
<i>Even after the day
that I'm laid in the ground</i>

39:45.425 --> 39:48.850
<i>'Cause, Jean, Oh, Jean</i>

39:49.012 --> 39:52.437
<i>You let me get lucky wi' you</i>

39:52.599 --> 39:56.399
<i>Jean, Oh, Jean</i>

39:56.561 --> 40:00.236
<i>You let me get lucky with you</i>

40:00.398 --> 40:04.119
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

40:04.277 --> 40:07.577
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

40:07.739 --> 40:11.414
<i>Jean, Oh, Jean</i>

40:11.576 --> 40:14.921
<i>You let him get lucky with you</i>

40:15.955 --> 40:19.129
<i>- Jean, Oh, Jean
- Oh, Jean!</i>

40:19.292 --> 40:22.011
<i>You let him get lucky with you</i>

40:24.213 --> 40:27.467
<i>- Jean, Oh, Jean</i>
- Dad!

40:27.634 --> 40:30.103
<i>You let him get lucky with you</i>

40:31.304 --> 40:34.399
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

40:34.557 --> 40:39.188
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

40:39.354 --> 40:41.903
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

40:42.732 --> 40:46.703
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

40:48.905 --> 40:50.452
Could you borrow me a tenner?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.918
Your dad'll have it.

41:03.336 --> 41:06.556
- There you go.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.137
Come on, Ally. Come on.

41:09.300 --> 41:13.100
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

41:13.262 --> 41:15.936
<i>He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her</i>

42:24.459 --> 42:26.211
It was one night.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.379
It wasn't meant to happen.

42:29.130 --> 42:32.634
She was going away.
We were just saying goodbye.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.928
You wanted to give her
something to remember you by.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.096
It wasn't like that.

42:37.889 --> 42:39.857
- Did you know?
- Know what?

42:40.016 --> 42:42.018
- About this girl?
- No. No.

42:42.185 --> 42:44.483
I knew nothing until that arrived.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.946
It's 25 years ago, Jean.

42:49.108 --> 42:52.578
We were married, Rab.
We'd made our vows.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.782
What can I say?

42:56.949 --> 42:58.292
What can I do?
Tell me.

42:59.786 --> 43:01.788
I want you to get out of my sight.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.548
I don't wanna look at you.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.556
25 years, Rab.

43:18.763 --> 43:21.516
25 years of what?

43:54.298 --> 43:57.302
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
your attention for a minute, please?

43:57.468 --> 44:00.597
- Oh, my God. What's he doing?
- Thank you.

44:01.556 --> 44:06.528
Now, we all know who we're here
to celebrate tonight. Rab and Jean.

44:10.398 --> 44:12.947
I don't know
where they've gone.

44:16.404 --> 44:19.374
But I'd like to do
some celebrating of my own.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.582
So I need to ask someone a question.

44:44.640 --> 44:49.020
Liz, I don't know what
the next 25 years is gonna bring us,

44:50.354 --> 44:54.734
but I do know I want
to spend 'em with you.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.383
Liz Henshaw,

45:14.545 --> 45:18.220
will you do me the honour
of becoming my wife?

45:33.773 --> 45:35.400
I can't.

45:35.566 --> 45:40.743
I can't. Ally, I can't.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

45:45.326 --> 45:46.794
I'd better go after her.

45:50.831 --> 45:53.584
Wee man, I hope you kept
the receipt for that.

45:56.545 --> 45:58.673
It's just a joke.
It's a joke, man.

46:07.390 --> 46:08.733
It was just a joke, man.

46:10.142 --> 46:13.021
- What did you say to me?
- What?

46:13.187 --> 46:14.734
Who are you?

46:23.114 --> 46:26.334
- Calm down. Control yourself.
- I'm not taking that from anybody.

46:26.492 --> 46:29.291
- Just leave it. Back off.
- Leave me alone, Davy.

46:29.453 --> 46:31.547
Hey, you, think you're
a big man, do you?

46:32.540 --> 46:36.670
Do you want me to kill you?
Do you want me to break you pal?

46:36.836 --> 46:39.464
Hit me again
and find out what happens.

46:50.975 --> 46:53.945
- Yvonne. Yvonne.
- Let's go.

46:54.103 --> 46:56.822
- Who are you?
- You saw what happened.

46:56.981 --> 47:00.110
- Liz. Lizzie.
- You cannae do that, Ally.

47:00.276 --> 47:01.448
You should have warned me.

47:01.610 --> 47:03.453
Would that have stopped you
walking out on me?

47:03.612 --> 47:06.161
- What was I supposed to do?
- You were supposed to say yes.

47:06.324 --> 47:10.374
Come on. Come on.
We're going home. Come on.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.884
I'll put the kettle on.

48:16.352 --> 48:17.899
You not going to work?

48:18.938 --> 48:22.738
You sick or something?
I could skip school.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.904
We could play the Xbox
or go down to the park if you want.

48:28.823 --> 48:30.166
See you later, then, Ally.

48:31.700 --> 48:33.702
See you.

48:40.418 --> 48:42.546
You should have said.
I would have done the shopping.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.256
It's done now.

48:46.715 --> 48:47.967
How was work?

48:54.140 --> 48:55.687
You want a cup of tea?

48:55.850 --> 48:57.773
Stop acting as if
nothing's happened.

49:02.606 --> 49:05.735
What do you want me to say?

49:05.901 --> 49:09.576
I made a mistake.
It was a long time ago.

49:09.738 --> 49:11.832
Do you think there's an expiry date
on these things,

49:11.991 --> 49:13.993
that after a while
you can't be held responsible?

49:14.160 --> 49:17.755
No, what I'm saying is
we've been through a lot in that time

49:17.913 --> 49:21.508
and I think that you should
remember some of that stuff.

49:21.667 --> 49:23.590
That makes it worse,

49:23.752 --> 49:26.551
knowing that this thing's
been there all that time,

49:26.714 --> 49:29.467
like a wee tumour
poisoning everything.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.235
Why do we stay together?

49:45.107 --> 49:47.610
What do you mean?

49:47.776 --> 49:49.744
What if it's just habit?

49:49.904 --> 49:52.953
What if it's 'cause we're
too frightened to do anything else?

49:53.115 --> 49:54.583
No, you don't believe that.

49:54.742 --> 49:56.870
I don't know anymore.

50:00.539 --> 50:02.462
We'll get through this.

50:02.625 --> 50:05.219
I promise you, we will
get through it. We'll sort it.

50:05.377 --> 50:08.051
I don't want you to see her again.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.597
- You mean Eilidh.
- I don't want to hear her name.

50:13.385 --> 50:16.980
I don't want to have to think
about her or her mother.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.475
Even

50:19.642 --> 50:22.111
- She's my daughter.
- Don't you dare.

50:22.269 --> 50:25.364
This is my family.
She's not part of it.

50:25.523 --> 50:28.697
- I will not allow it.
- You want me just to cut her off?

50:30.319 --> 50:32.947
You hardly know her.

50:34.907 --> 50:38.332
No. No, I can't do that.
It's not her fault.

50:41.455 --> 50:43.753
Then she's all you'll be left with.

50:55.553 --> 51:00.434
<i>I like the smell of perfume</i>

51:01.350 --> 51:06.277
<i>I love the taste of booze</i>

51:07.231 --> 51:11.862
<i>But I hate my love for you</i>

51:13.028 --> 51:17.659
<i>Yeah, I hate my love for you</i>

51:19.159 --> 51:23.505
<i>I like Johnny Cash</i>

51:24.707 --> 51:29.338
<i>Singing 'A Boy Named Sue'</i>

51:30.546 --> 51:35.017
<i>But I hate my love for you</i>

51:36.385 --> 51:41.391
<i>Yeah, I hate my love for you</i>

51:42.683 --> 51:47.735
<i>Yeah, I hate my love for you</i>

51:49.315 --> 51:51.317
<i>Most of all</i>

52:19.595 --> 52:22.144
You should have warned me.
You should have said something.

52:22.306 --> 52:24.308
I did.

52:24.475 --> 52:27.194
All that stuff about the future?
We spoke about it.

52:27.353 --> 52:29.230
And I told you that it scared me.

52:30.731 --> 52:32.733
I thought it was what you wanted.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.986
Why would you think that?

52:36.612 --> 52:39.206
Because you said
it's what everybody wanted.

52:39.365 --> 52:41.834
For God's sake, Ally.

52:44.036 --> 52:46.664
We have a great time together.
I love being with you.

52:46.830 --> 52:48.832
You're my best pal.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.006
That doesn't mean
I'm ready to march down the aisle.

52:52.169 --> 52:55.093
You've gotta settle down sometime.

52:55.255 --> 52:57.257
I don't want to settle.

52:59.218 --> 53:03.098
- You don't wanna settle for me.
- That's not what I meant.

53:03.889 --> 53:08.110
So what do you want? What is it
that you want that's so much better?

53:12.356 --> 53:14.358
I want the world.

53:15.567 --> 53:19.288
Ally, you know,
I want sunshine and skyscrapers.

53:20.280 --> 53:24.035
Languages I don't understand.
Music I've never heard before.

53:27.788 --> 53:29.790
It sounds like a travel brochure.

53:31.917 --> 53:35.091
- Don't laugh at me.
- It hurts, doesn't it?

53:40.968 --> 53:43.062
I'll talk to you later, OK?

53:44.680 --> 53:46.682
No.

53:49.101 --> 53:51.399
What else have we
got to talk about?

53:55.315 --> 53:57.317
You don't mean that.

53:58.402 --> 54:01.076
I don't want to be your pal, Liz.

54:13.208 --> 54:15.802
Yvonne, we need to talk.

54:17.004 --> 54:19.632
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Then listen.

54:19.798 --> 54:22.847
I know it looked bad
and it was bad.

54:23.010 --> 54:25.854
- But it's not what you think.
- Leave me alone, Davy.

54:26.013 --> 54:27.890
You're jumping to conclusions
and I understand why.

54:28.056 --> 54:29.729
But I promise you,
I would never hurt you.

54:29.892 --> 54:33.817
<i>Thought that I'd be happy
Gonna be so happy</i>

54:33.979 --> 54:37.859
<i>Living life alone
and never sharing anything</i>

54:38.025 --> 54:41.575
<i>Thought that I was finished
Thought that I was complete</i>

54:41.737 --> 54:45.116
<i>Thought that I was whole
instead of being half of something</i>

54:45.282 --> 54:49.037
<i>Thought that I was growing
Growing older, wiser</i>

54:49.203 --> 54:52.628
<i>Understanding why this world
held nothing for my spirit</i>

54:52.790 --> 54:56.215
<i>Thought that I was destined
Destined to be nothing</i>

54:56.376 --> 55:00.677
<i>Destined to be nothing in this world
and then I met you</i>

55:00.839 --> 55:02.933
<i>I met you</i>

55:04.218 --> 55:07.438
<i>I met you</i>

55:08.222 --> 55:10.691
<i>I met you</i>

55:11.975 --> 55:14.945
<i>I met you</i>

55:16.188 --> 55:19.567
- Maybe I just expect too much.
- Maybe you just expect the worst.

55:19.733 --> 55:22.577
- You scared me.
- I know. I'm sorry.

55:22.736 --> 55:26.786
<i>- Thought the book was written
- Thought the game had ended</i>

55:26.949 --> 55:30.624
<i>Thought the song was sung
and I could never sing another</i>

55:30.786 --> 55:34.290
<i>Thought I knew this city
Thought I knew all about it</i>

55:34.456 --> 55:38.177
<i>And then one night I went to
Morningside and you were waiting</i>

55:38.335 --> 55:41.134
<i>I met you</i>

55:42.130 --> 55:44.849
<i>I met you</i>

55:45.968 --> 55:48.596
<i>I met you</i>

55:49.721 --> 55:52.816
<i>I met you</i>

55:53.559 --> 55:56.813
<i>I met you</i>

55:56.979 --> 56:00.825
<i>I met you</i>

56:00.983 --> 56:04.237
<i>I met you</i>

56:04.403 --> 56:07.782
<i>I met you</i>

56:22.296 --> 56:25.641
Have you chucked that job
at the call centre, then?

56:26.925 --> 56:30.099
Thing is, Ally, you need to have
a think about what you're doing,

56:30.262 --> 56:32.014
where you're going.

56:32.180 --> 56:35.354
- You can't stay here.
- I'll sort something out.

56:35.517 --> 56:37.645
It's not fair on the wee ones.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.563
- They need their space.
- Chrissie!

56:44.276 --> 56:46.574
I'll sort something out.

56:47.779 --> 56:49.873
How are you doing, sweetheart?

56:52.242 --> 56:53.960
He doesn't wanna see me any more.

56:54.119 --> 56:56.121
He's just hurting, Lizzie.

56:57.289 --> 57:00.418
- It's not your fault.
- I'm the one who turned him down.

57:00.584 --> 57:03.508
You've gotta make your own mind
up about what's right for you.

57:03.670 --> 57:06.298
Anybody that cares
about you will understand.

57:07.090 --> 57:08.717
But what if...

57:10.469 --> 57:13.473
What if what you want's
gonna hurt other people?

57:13.639 --> 57:16.643
You cannae go along
with something for their sake.

57:16.808 --> 57:19.186
It'll only make things
worse in the end.

57:30.697 --> 57:32.290
I found this website.

57:32.449 --> 57:37.501
It's a recruitment agency
for health care workers.

57:37.663 --> 57:42.510
So I put my details in
and they came back with an offer.

57:45.295 --> 57:48.219
- Florida?
- Yeah.

57:49.216 --> 57:51.139
And you never said anything.

57:52.719 --> 57:55.393
Well, you said
I should make up my own mind.

58:00.060 --> 58:03.690
Come here.
That's great, your news, darling.

58:05.565 --> 58:07.567
Thanks, Mum.

58:26.294 --> 58:29.514
Yeah, I'm looking forward
to working with you, mate.

58:29.673 --> 58:31.095
So long as you're up for a laugh.

58:54.614 --> 58:56.662
Thank you.

58:56.825 --> 58:58.748
- Hiya.
- Your name?

58:58.910 --> 59:01.413
- If you make it out to Rab.
- Rab.

59:01.580 --> 59:03.753
No. Robert.

59:03.915 --> 59:05.963
- Robert.
- Yeah.

59:06.126 --> 59:09.505
- OK.
- Can I ask you a personal question?

59:09.671 --> 59:12.390
If you were to fall
out with your partner

59:12.549 --> 59:16.304
and you wanted to cook something
really special to win them over,

59:16.470 --> 59:19.394
anything in this book
you'd recommend?

59:19.556 --> 59:24.232
Are we talking simple but sweet
or seriously impressive?

59:24.394 --> 59:27.147
I was hoping for bloody miraculous.

59:30.817 --> 59:34.617
Escallops of veal and Marsala.
It's a classic.

59:36.364 --> 59:37.741
Veal?

59:38.658 --> 59:39.659
Veal.

59:42.079 --> 59:44.081
Veal?

59:46.416 --> 59:47.417
OK.

59:51.004 --> 59:52.221
You forgot your book.

59:54.049 --> 59:56.268
Are you kidding me?
17 quid?

59:56.426 --> 59:59.100
I could fly to Italy for 17 quid.

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:03.730
It's like he's been
lying to me all this time.

01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:06.270
- Have you thrown him out?
- He's on the couch.

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:09.356
Should be in a kennel if you ask me.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:12.197
And Liz is moving halfway
round the world for a new job.

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.202
- Where's she going?
- Florida.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:18.332
Florida? I'd love to go there.

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.959
My family's falling apart.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:23.120
I feel like it's my fault.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:26.707
Jean, I'm sorry,
I couldn't help overhearing.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:28.591
Harry, I'm just being stupid.

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:32.095
Aye, you are being stupid if
you think any of this is your fault.

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:36.971
Come here. Come on. Come on.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:41.105
- It can happen in any family.
- Come on. Come on.

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:44.437
Mary Queen of Scots,
born 1542, died 1587.

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:46.818
Her third husband
murdered her second husband,

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:50.902
her cousin tried her for treason
and her son stole her throne.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:54.944
It's true. If she was alive today,
she'd be on the Jeremy Kyle Show.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.408
So you listen to me, Jean Henshaw.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.074
Whatever happened is not your fault.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.040
You have done nothing but work yourself
into the ground for your family.

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:07.627
<i>You've been letdown,
messed around</i>

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:09.962
<i>Told to get your feet
back on the ground</i>

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.547
<i>When you should have been loved</i>

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.337
<i>- Should have been loved
- Loved, loved</i>

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:16.507
<i>- You should have been loved
- Should have been loved</i>

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:20.098
<i>You've been ripped off, written off</i>

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.354
<i>Told an act of kindness
makes you soft</i>

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.014
<i>When you should have been loved</i>

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.433
<i>- Should have been loved
- Loved, loved</i>

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.694
<i>- You should have been loved
- Should have been loved</i>

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:35.906
<i>But all your detractors
underestimated you</i>

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:39.913
<i>'Cause they don't know you like I do</i>

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:44.452
<i>Aye, it's been rough
You've put up with stuff</i>

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:47.041
<i>Times when we thought
you'd had enough</i>

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:48.626
<i>When you should have been loved</i>

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:50.210
<i>- Should have been loved
- Loved, loved</i>

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:53.297
<i>- You should have been loved
- Should have been loved</i>

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.805
<i>And anything new
you tried to do</i>

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:59.057
<i>Got you treated
like a jumper in a queue</i>

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.934
<i>When you should have been loved</i>

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:02.469
<i>- Should have been loved
- Loved, loved</i>

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:05.310
<i>- You should have been loved
- Should have been loved</i>

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:10.148
<i>But when there was pity</i>

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.358
<i>And when there was wealth</i>

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:17.989
<i>You wasted neither on yourself</i>

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:27.453
<i>- Should have been loved
- Should have been loved</i>

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:29.041
<i>Should have been loved</i>

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.797
<i>Should have been loved</i>

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.510
<i>- Should have been loved
- Should have been loved</i>

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.767
Ooh, my back!

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:49.855
<i>Whoa, your detractors
underestimated you</i>

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:54.897
<i>'Cause they don't
know you like we do</i>

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:58.658
<i>I've been let down, messed around</i>

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:00.911
<i>Told to get my feet
back on the ground</i>

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:04.073
<i>When I should have been
loved, loved, loved</i>

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:06.082
<i>I should have been loved</i>

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:11.539
<i>Should have been loved
Should have been loved</i>

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.549
<i>Should have been loved
Should have been loved</i>

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:17.587
<i>Should have been loved
Should have been loved</i>

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:20.505
<i>Should have been loved
Should have been loved</i>

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:25.219
<i>Should have been loved</i>

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.807
Bloody veal.
18 quid.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.312
18 quid.

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:55.632
Are you all right?

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.258
Yeah.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.670
You are gonna have to speak to him,
you know.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:02.305
I know.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.265
I'm scared, Rab.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:52.939
You're scaring me.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:02.445
At least you're not complaining
about me holding your hand.

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:04.735
You never liked that, did you?

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.869
Shoved them in your pockets

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:09.702
rather than walk down the street
like this.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:15.704
But I rumbled you.
Years ago.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.257
When my dad died.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.965
You held my hand then.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:24.129
You held onto it.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:29.134
Tight.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:39.354
<i>My heart was broken</i>

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:45.234
<i>My heart was broken</i>

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.862
<i>Sorrow</i>

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.449
<i>Sorrow</i>

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:56.043
<i>Sorrow</i>

01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:59.839
<i>Sorrow</i>

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:04.629
<i>My heart was broken</i>

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:08.924
<i>My heart was broken</i>

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.058
<i>You saw it</i>

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:13.595
<i>You claimed it</i>

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:15.229
<i>You touched it</i>

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:18.141
<i>You saved it</i>

01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:21.690
<i>While I'm worth</i>

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:27.155
<i>My room on this earth</i>

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:33.620
<i>I will be with you</i>

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:40.793
<i>While the chief</i>

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:45.051
<i>Puts sunshine on Leith</i>

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:49.840
<i>I thank him for his work</i>

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.475
<i>And your birth</i>

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:57.310
<i>And my birth</i>

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:59.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:21.588
<i>My heart was broken</i>

01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:26.092
<i>My heart was broken</i>

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:28.299
<i>Sorrow</i>

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.555
<i>Sorrow</i>

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.932
<i>Sorrow</i>

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.968
<i>Sorrow</i>

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:39.514
<i>My heart was broken</i>

01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:43.902
<i>My heart was broken</i>

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.062
<i>You saw it</i>

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:48.448
<i>You claimed it</i>

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:51.029
<i>You touched it</i>

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:53.695
<i>You saved it</i>

01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:57.161
<i>While I'm worth</i>

01:07:57.323 --> 01:08:00.873
<i>My room on this earth</i>

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:08.294
<i>I will be with you</i>

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:14.306
<i>While the chief</i>

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:18.845
<i>Puts sunshine on Leith</i>

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:23.809
<i>I thank him for his work</i>

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:25.568
<i>And your birth</i>

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:28.947
<i>And my birth</i>

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:11.363
The tests suggest the damage
isn't as extensive as we feared.

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:13.899
He was lucky.
I've given him a sedative.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.363
He'll be out for some time.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:18.029
You should think
about getting some rest yourselves.

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:19.913
I'm not leaving him.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:22.496
Mum, he's out of danger.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.287
The doctor's right, OK?
I'm taking you home to get some rest.

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:27.421
I'm not leaving him here on his own.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.548
I'll stay. You go home.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.926
I'll call you when he wakes up.

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:33.758
Are you sure?

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:36.631
All right.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:04.329
Hiya, Dad.

01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:06.415
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:08.955
How are you feeling today?

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:12.217
- Yeah, I'm OK.
- Yeah? Good.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:16.300
Except for Miami.
Passport, visa, suntan lotion.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.930
I'm not going, Dad.

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:19.716
What, because of me?

01:10:20.842 --> 01:10:22.515
No.

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:26.352
How do you think I'm gonna feel if I
thought you didn't go because of me?

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:29.066
Come on.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.569
I wanna be lying
here thinking of you

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:34.698
driving the wrong side of the road,
your Cadillac,

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:36.858
checking your swimming
pool for crocodiles.

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:38.150
Alligators, Dad.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.237
Whatever.

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:45.032
You have to go.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.543
I can't, Dad.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:50.455
I remember when you were little

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:52.919
and we used to go
on those crazy summer holidays.

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:56.461
You were the adventurous one.
You were all over the place.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.504
More than Davy,
and that's saying something.

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.969
But abroad, Dad,
it's different.

01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:03.134
Hey, you're a Scot.
We have to travel to get work.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:05.804
- Always have and we always will.
- You never moved.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:08.689
Glasgow to Edinburgh,
if you don't mind.

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:10.441
Had a nosebleed at
Waverley Station.

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:16.026
I don't want you spending
the rest of your life wondering.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.985
You have to go out there.
You have to grab it.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:24.034
OK, look, I'm gonna go.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.620
- Let you get some...
- No, no, no. No, no.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:29.827
You have to promise me first.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.290
Promise me you'll go.

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:41.092
I don't want you just
staying for me.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.257
Promise me you'll go.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.142
OK.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.937
OK what?
Is that a promise?

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.856
- OK, I promise.
- Yeah? Big promise?

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:01.742
Big grown-up, cross
your heart, hope to die,

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:04.245
spit on your mother's
grave kind of promise?

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.246
Yeah, I promise.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.202
Gotta go, OK?

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.503
Thanks, Dad.

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:36.815
So where have you been, man?
Been looking for you.

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:38.446
I wanted space.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:43.568
Look, Ally, I'm sorry. I wish
it could have worked out better.

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.412
I hear she's going away.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:51.243
Makes sense, I suppose.

01:12:51.409 --> 01:12:55.459
I know it feels like
the end of the world, but it's not.

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.419
Things move on. You'll get over it.

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:05.924
So Davy's got it all sussed, has he?

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.092
Davy and Yvonne.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.811
What happens when
you make a mistake?

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.974
Maybe you say the wrong thing,
ask the wrong question.

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:17.189
You wait and see
how quickly she dumps you then.

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:18.443
I'm just trying to help.

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:20.276
I don't remember asking
for your help.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:23.984
So what are you gonna do?

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:26.744
Well, there's nothing
for me here now, so...

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:30.203
- Where are you gonna go?
- Where do you think I'm going?

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:32.207
I've joined up again.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:36.121
Ally, you know what it's like out there.
You know what can happen.

01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:38.836
- It's not that bad.
- We nearly died, Ally. It's crazy.

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:41.376
So it's not what
we're supposed to be doing?

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:44.421
Looking for some sort of adventure,
something new, something else?

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.806
- Not settling for what we've got?
- What about Ronnie?

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:48.386
Think he'd settle for what he's got?

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.176
- Ronnie was unlucky.
- You need to think about this.

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:51.390
- I have.
- Think again.

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:55.273
- Stop telling me what to do.
- Why would you want to go back?

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.433
Because they wanted me!

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.410
- Ally, I'm begging You-
- Davy.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.570
I get it.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:12.990
You need to let me do this.

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:23.043
Keep your head down.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.557
Don't do anything stupid.
D'you hear?

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.469
Hey.

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.480
I'll be fine.

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:48.200
I'll be fine.

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:52.868
Hi, Rab. Jean dropped this off
earlier for you when you were asleep.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.282
I thought I'd pop it in.

01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:26.530
Where's that?

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:29.283
That's Ullapool, I think.
Have you been up there?

01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:32.742
No, I've been meaning to.
It looks so beautiful.

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:36.578
Lizzie.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:44.332
- We're all gonna miss her.
- Yeah.

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:47.877
As if my heart
wasn't breaking enough.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.006
The joys of parenthood.

01:15:57.428 --> 01:16:01.649
You'll want to go shopping when you
get there. You don't need all this.

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:12.276
Tell me about the hospital again.

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:16.030
Well, it's a teaching hospital,

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:18.666
so I could choose a specialism

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:21.543
and do a masters if I want.

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:24.956
Well, you'd better.
What will you go for?

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:30.011
- Nurse practitioner?
- That's nearly a doctor, isn't it?

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:32.839
Not quite.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:38.390
Well, that's what I'll be telling people
when I'm bragging about you.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:42.356
You'll be fine, Lizzie.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.018
You'll be fine.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:49.109
Go on, try that now.

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:03.954
<i>When you go will you send back</i>

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.670
<i>A letter from America?</i>

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:12.133
<i>Take a look up the rail track</i>

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:15.844
<i>From Miami to Canada</i>

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:20.595
<i>Broke off from my work the other day</i>

01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:25.392
<i>I spent the evening thinking about
all the blood that ﬂowed away</i>

01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:29.028
<i>Across the ocean
to the second chance</i>

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:35.284
<i>I wonder how it got on
when it reached the promised land</i>

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:40.373
<i>When you go will you send back</i>

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:43.956
<i>A letter from America?</i>

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:48.589
<i>Take a look up the rail track</i>

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:52.251
<i>From Miami to Canada</i>

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:57.006
<i>I've looked at the ocean
Tried hard to imagine</i>

01:17:57.173 --> 01:18:01.644
<i>The way they felt the day they sailed
from Wester Ross to Nova Scotia</i>

01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:04.806
<i>We should have held you
We should have told you</i>

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:07.316
<i>But you know our sense of timing</i>

01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:10.523
<i>We always wait too long</i>

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:16.109
<i>When you go will you send back</i>

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.905
<i>A letter from America?</i>

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:23.290
<i>Take a look up the rail track</i>

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:28.163
<i>From Miami to Canada</i>

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:36.921
<i>Lochaber no more
Sutherland no more</i>

01:18:37.087 --> 01:18:40.182
<i>Lewis no more
Skye no more</i>

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:45.100
<i>Lochaber no more
Sutherland no more</i>

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:49.438
<i>Lewis no more
Skye no more</i>

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.275
<i>Lochaber no more
Sutherland no more</i>

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:57.692
<i>Lewis no more
Skye no more</i>

01:18:57.858 --> 01:19:01.283
<i>I wonder, my blood
Will you ever return</i>

01:19:01.445 --> 01:19:05.825
<i>To help us kick the life back
to a dying mutual friend</i>

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:09.586
<i>Do we not love her?
Do we not say we love her?</i>

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:16.048
<i>Do we have to roam the world
to prove how much it hurts?</i>

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:20.465
<i>When you go
will you send back</i>

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:24.306
<i>A letter from America?</i>

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:28.564
<i>Take a look up the rail track</i>

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:33.148
<i>From Miami to Canada</i>

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:37.065
<i>Bathgate no more
Linwood no more</i>

01:19:37.231 --> 01:19:40.986
<i>Methil no more
Irvine no more</i>

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:45.076
Bathgate no
more Linwood no more

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:48.994
<i>Methil no more
Irvine no more</i>

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:53.130
<i>Bathgate no more
Linwood no more</i>

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:57.886
<i>Methil no more
Irvine no more</i>

01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:02.469
<i>Bathgate no more
Linwood no more</i>

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:08.809
<i>Methil no more
Irvine no more</i>

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.643
<i>Across the ocean</i>

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.562
<i>To the second chance</i>

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:19.653
<i>I wonder how it got on</i>

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:24.491
<i>When it reached the
promised land</i>

01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:34.456
Everything with your dad
makes you think a bit, doesn't it?

01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:37.875
If the same thing happened to my mum,
I'd wanna be there for her too.

01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:40.044
Of course.

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:43.589
Even if it meant me going home?

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:47.472
Nothing has happened to your mum.

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:52.641
- Has it?
- No, but it could.

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:54.774
What if I had to go?

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:58.487
Well, then, I'd understand.

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:03.450
I thought you might be a little bit
more concerned than that.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:08.827
- Well, course I'd be concerned.
- Well, good.

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:11.617
That's a slight improvement
on 'I'd understand'.

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:14.128
What's the problem here?

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:17.540
- This is all hypothetical.
- But this isn't, us. This is real.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:21.051
- I thought this was about your mum.
- No, Davy, this is about me and you.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:23.212
If something happens,
I wanna know if you'd come with me.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:26.098
- To England?
- Does it matter where?

01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:28.304
Well, aye, if it's England.

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:29.889
What?

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:35.600
Look, my family's here.
I can't just abandon them.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.484
You ran off to the
army quick enough.

01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:40.613
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, right, so I'm being ridiculous.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:42.364
- Aren't you?
- OK, fine.

01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:45.072
Tell me, if I went,
would you come with me?

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.783
Or what? That's us finished?

01:21:47.945 --> 01:21:50.289
- It's not an ultimatum.
- Well, it sounds like it.

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:53.621
- Well, answer the question, then!
- No.

01:21:57.496 --> 01:22:01.217
- I think you'd better go, then.
- Fine, I will.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.776
Ally?

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.067
Hi, Ma.
How you doing?

01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:03.190
Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:07.950
Yeah, no, I just...
I thought I'd ask how you'd feel

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.486
about me maybe coming
home for a bit.

01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:15.287
Well, I don't really know yet.
Maybe quite a while.

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:17.918
Or for good.
Not sure.

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:23.791
So am I back on the couch?

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:26.176
You broke your vows, Rab.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:29.259
I cannae pretend it didn't happen.

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:32.265
I cannae act like
I'm not hurt by it.

01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:37.429
But I'll live with it.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:40.432
Thank you.

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:43.310
I'm not gonna stop seeing Eilidh.

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:46.234
With Liz and Davy,
you made me promise

01:23:46.396 --> 01:23:49.275
that I would be as good
a father as I could be.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:53.238
And I tried. I'm still trying.

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:56.532
But you just can't turn
that off like it's a tap.

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:01.791
I need to try for her.
I need to see her.

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.167
What are you thinking?

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.924
I think you're stubborn.

01:24:10.087 --> 01:24:12.215
Infuriating.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.224
And utterly predictable.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:18.308
So are we going home
together or what?

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.432
Why don't you ask the driver?

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:34.827
Hi.

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:37.664
Hiya.

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:43.791
How are you feeling?

01:24:43.954 --> 01:24:46.377
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.883
Good.

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:49.418
Right.

01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:53.679
Car's just outside.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:09.150
Dad wants a cup of tea.
I'll make it.

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:12.491
You all right?

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:14.651
Aye, fine.

01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:19.281
Do you wanna make it work?

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:22.327
- Eh?
- You and Yvonne.

01:25:22.492 --> 01:25:24.369
Do you really wanna make it work?

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:28.332
- Aye, I do, but...
- No buts, Davy.

01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:32.344
If you love her,
just go and get her.

01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:58.120
- Where are you going?
- I need to speak to Yvonne.

01:25:58.278 --> 01:26:00.701
She's gone.
You're too late.

01:26:00.864 --> 01:26:04.243
What do you mean?
Where's she gone?

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:07.413
- I don't know if I'm allowed to say.
- Francine.

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:09.581
- Well, I...
- Where's she gone?

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:13.256
She's gone to get the train home,
to England.

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.420
She was really upset.

01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:22.265
What? I had to tell him.
They're in love.

01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:51.456
Sorry.

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:24.581
Yvonne!

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.586
Yvonne, wait, please. Yvonne.

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:30.997
- What do you want?
- I need to ask you a question.

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:33.336
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- I need to know something.

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:35.466
I'm gonna be late
for my train, Davy.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.252
Do you want to make this work?

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:40.798
- What?
- You and me, I mean.

01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:43.308
- Do you want to make this work?
- Look, Davy...

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:46.971
I don't know how things'll work out,
Yvonne, and I can live with that.

01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:49.606
But if you're not ready
to take that chance...

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:53.565
Me? What do you mean,
if I'm not ready?

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:56.571
- So you are ready?
- No, not any more.

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:58.198
- But you just said...
- I was ready.

01:27:58.356 --> 01:28:01.109
And then you made your
position perfectly clear.

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:04.997
But, I thought you were
looking for an excuse to end it.

01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:06.907
I was looking for a reason
to keep going.

01:28:07.073 --> 01:28:12.079
- Why didn't you say that?
- I did. I asked you and you said no.

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.668
- That wasn't the question.
- Yes, it was.

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:16.299
Was it?

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:23.299
Look, look, ask me again,
but this time

01:28:23.465 --> 01:28:25.718
please keep it simple.

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:37.817
Your family, your home, they're
important to you, I get that, but...

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.481
I don't know where I fit in.

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:40.991
You're a part of all
of that now.

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:43.277
What if I have to leave
and you have to choose?

01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:45.161
I don't wanna be the one
who loses out.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.542
Well, then, tell me honestly,
do you want to make this work?

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.715
Do you think I'd be
standing here if I didn't?

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:04.968
Is that a yes?

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:09.140
Yes.

01:29:16.935 --> 01:29:19.029
So?

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.189
So?

01:29:23.441 --> 01:29:25.443
Right.

01:29:26.486 --> 01:29:30.036
If you have to go back to England,
I'll come with you.

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:32.451
- Really?
- Really.

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.619
I don't mind.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:40.505
Actually, it's not true.
I would mind.

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:42.669
But I'd still come.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:49.301
<i>When I wake up
Well, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:53.722
<i>I'm gonna be the one
who wakes up next to you</i>

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:58.269
<i>When I go out
Well, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:29:58.435 --> 01:30:03.407
<i>I'm gonna be the one
who goes along with you</i>

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:07.320
<i>If I get drunk
Well, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:12.332
<i>I'm gonna be the one
who gets drunk next to you</i>

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:18.543
<i>And if I haver
Hey, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:30:18.705 --> 01:30:22.209
<i>I'm gonna be the man
who's havering to you</i>

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:27.013
<i>If I'm working
Yeah, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:32.053
<i>I'm gonna be the one
who's working hard for you</i>

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:36.974
<i>And when the money
comes in for the work I do</i>

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:41.145
<i>I'll pass almost
every penny on to you</i>

01:30:42.395 --> 01:30:46.320
<i>And if I grow old
Well, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:52.035
<i>I'm gonna be the one
who's growing old with you</i>

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:56.577
<i>And when I come home
Well, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:30:56.743 --> 01:31:02.295
<i>I'm gonna be the one
who comes back home to you</i>

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:06.257
<i>When I'm lonely
Well, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:31:06.419 --> 01:31:10.515
<i>I'm gonna be the one
who's lonely without you</i>

01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:16.313
<i>And when I'm dreaming
Well, I know I'm gonna dream</i>

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:21.102
<i>I'm gonna dream
about the time I had with you</i>

01:31:21.267 --> 01:31:25.738
<i>And when I go out
Well, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:30.152
<i>I'm gonna be the one
who's thinking about you</i>

01:31:31.111 --> 01:31:35.412
<i>When I come home
Yes, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:40.454
<i>I'm gonna be
The one who comes back home to you</i>

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:47.048
<i>I'm gonna be the one
who's coming home to you</i>

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:52.678
<i>And I would walk 500 miles</i>

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:55.720
<i>And I would walk 500 more</i>

01:31:55.885 --> 01:32:00.686
<i>Just to be the man
who walks a thousand miles</i>

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:03.819
<i>To fall down at your door</i>

01:32:03.977 --> 01:32:06.981
<i>And I would walk 500 miles</i>

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:10.617
<i>And I would walk 500 more</i>

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:15.076
<i>Just to be the one

<i>To fall down at your door</i>

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:24.293
- Come on, hen, up here.
- Come on, follow us.

01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:25.673
- Come on.
- This way.

01:32:25.832 --> 01:32:28.676
- Be cool.
- Come on, girls! Get up!

01:32:28.835 --> 01:32:30.883
Come on.

01:32:33.923 --> 01:32:37.177
<i>And I would walk 500 miles</i>

01:32:37.343 --> 01:32:40.768
