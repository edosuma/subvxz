We're only going
to catch a few sets.

{\an5}So, why's your mom
so worried about you
all of a sudden?

01:39.557 --> 01:40.850
No reason.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.404
Hmm, for the fiesta.

Yes. Perfect.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.863
Oh, man!

06:50.993 --> 06:52.870
Whassup, Twist?

06:52.954 --> 06:54.163
What happened to you?

06:54.247 --> 06:55.706
I kind of just felt
like being alone.

06:55.790 --> 07:00.253
But Sammy was going to show us
his idea for the fiesta.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.630
Okay.
Guess what sound I'm making?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.094
{\an1}Well?

07:08.177 --> 07:10.638
{\an5}It's the sound
of you beefing it
in the half pipe?

07:10.721 --> 07:11.848
No, it's a battle.

07:11.931 --> 07:16.477
I'm doing a sound interpretation
of Cinco de Mayo.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.648
The fifth of May was the day
a small band of Mexicans

07:20.731 --> 07:23.860
defeated a large contingent
of the French army

07:23.943 --> 07:29.115
so the French wouldn't install
an emperor over them.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.622
Great, Sammy.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.874
Yeah, real cool.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.250
(<i> squeaking</i> ):
Why does everything

07:39.333 --> 07:42.545
have to be Cinco de Mayo,
Cinco de Mayo?

07:42.628 --> 07:45.715
{\an1}Twister, will you just tell us
what's wrong, already?

07:45.798 --> 07:47.049
Yeah. What's up with
your voice, dude?

07:47.133 --> 07:49.010
I cracked it.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.262
<i>Cracked</i> it?

07:51.345 --> 07:54.223
I don't think
that's possible, Twist.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.225
Well, I did.
I cracked it really bad

07:56.309 --> 07:58.936
and I keep doing all the things
Lars told me to

07:59.020 --> 08:00.479
and nothing makes it better.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.232
You listened to Lars?
That's crazy.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.192
Totally nuts.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.776
Definitely
not recommended.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.488
I'm just going to tell my
parents I can't sing anymore.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.782
I hope there's room
in your house

08:11.866 --> 08:14.493
'cause they're going
to kick me out for sure.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.168
Mom?

08:22.251 --> 08:24.921
I know you're going to be
really disappointed

08:25.004 --> 08:26.422
but I can't sing at the fiesta.

08:26.505 --> 08:29.467
{\an1}What are you talking
about,<i> mi hijo?</i>

08:29.550 --> 08:32.678
{\an5}(<i> squeaking</i> ):
I stayed out surfing
like you told me not to

08:32.761 --> 08:34.429
and I don't feel so good.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.601
Do you have a cold?
Sore throat? Fever?

08:38.683 --> 08:42.855
Worse than that--
I cracked my voice.

08:42.938 --> 08:47.235
Who filled your head with this
"cracking your voice" nonsense?

08:47.318 --> 08:47.610
Lars?

08:50.029 --> 08:52.448
Well, you can forget
about everything he said.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.367
You're getting older,
that's all.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.701
Your voice is changing.

08:55.785 --> 08:59.497
Maurice Rodriguez,
you are becoming a man.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.665
To heck with the concert.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.960
You have other things
to think about now.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.002
I do?

09:05.086 --> 09:06.295
Like what?

09:06.379 --> 09:09.548
Well, girls, for instance.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.967
(<i> both laughing</i> )

09:20.726 --> 09:22.645
(<i> kids shrieking</i> )

09:24.522 --> 09:25.606

09:29.902 --> 09:33.322
Coconut enchiladas,
pineapple tacos.

09:35.574 --> 09:39.537
Step right up and take a whack
at Emperor Maximilian

09:39.620 --> 09:40.705

09:45.751 --> 09:50.423
Poor Lars, getting whomped
by all the widdle kiddies.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.591
Maybe we could go
back and give him

09:52.675 --> 09:55.177
a Cinco de Mayo
noogie, huh, Twist?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.804
Oh, yeah, yeah, huh.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.472
Twister, what are you
so bummed about?

09:58.556 --> 10:01.100
Yeah, your folks
let you off.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.852
No concert, dude.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.604
And I get to do my sound
interpretation instead.

10:05.688 --> 10:09.984
{\an1}I know you guys think
singing is lame, but...

10:10.067 --> 10:11.819
I kind of wanted
to do it anyway.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.655
I mean, how can I be
turning into a man

10:14.739 --> 10:16.699
when I can't even do
a little concert?

10:16.782 --> 10:19.577
(<i> mimicking</i> ):
A concert?

10:19.660 --> 10:21.787
{\an3}(<i> laughs</i> )

10:21.871 --> 10:25.207
{\an1}If that's how you feel, maybe
you should still do the concert.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.918
But how can I
with my voice like this?

10:28.002 --> 10:30.504
{\an5}So what, bro?
Who cares if it
cracks a little?

10:30.588 --> 10:32.673
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

10:32.757 --> 10:37.553
And now, Twister Rodriguez
and Violet Stimpleton.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.722
Twister?
But I thought...

10:39.805 --> 10:42.767

11:09.251 --> 11:13.589
{\an5}Now, that's just about
the finest sound
I have ever heard.

11:21.597 --> 11:27.019
(<i> all singing in Spanish</i> )

11:28.813 --> 11:30.064

this way.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.108
Thanks, Squid.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.318
I couldn't have done
it without you guys.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.654
(<i> voice cracks</i> ):
No sweat, dude.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.947
Huh?

11:39.365 --> 11:40.616
(<i> all imitate voice cracking</i> )

11:40.699 --> 11:43.452
What's the matter,
voice changing?

11:43.536 --> 11:44.745
(<i> laughing</i> )

12:14.108 --> 12:16.068
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

12:22.450 --> 12:24.034
Huh?

12:24.118 --> 12:26.579
Aaah!

12:29.290 --> 12:30.958
Freeze, criminal!

12:31.041 --> 12:32.918
{\an1}You are in direct violation
of code niner eight six

12:33.002 --> 12:36.881
{\an1}dash four zero three:
no surfing in the swimming area.

12:36.964 --> 12:37.798
{\an3}Sir...

12:37.882 --> 12:41.260
There's nobody out here but us.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.679
{\an1}Entirely beside
the point, Rocket.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.973
{\an1}As of now,
you are all beached.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.601
How about you let us off
with just a warning?

12:48.684 --> 12:49.810
{\an1}Negative!

12:49.894 --> 12:52.313
Warnings are for fires,
floods and aerosol cans!

12:52.396 --> 12:54.231
But you always
give us a warning.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.441
Not today.

12:55.524 --> 12:56.734
It's inspection day,

12:56.817 --> 12:59.320
and I don't want my mentor,
Major Mad Dog Madison,

12:59.403 --> 13:01.197
to find you hoodlums
violating beach regulations.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.532
{\an1}Now, go!

13:12.208 --> 13:14.293
What's this?

13:14.376 --> 13:16.295
No swimming,
no surfing.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.422
No littering,
no fishing.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.883
No eating lunch on the roof.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.134
Man, what's next?

13:22.218 --> 13:24.386
No standing in
front of the sign!

13:24.470 --> 13:25.554
That's what's next.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.139
(<i> helicopter whirring</i> )

13:35.064 --> 13:35.564
Man.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.234
This looks way bad.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.735
Major Madison, sir.
Welcome to Ocean Shores.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.321
I think you'll
find everything

13:42.404 --> 13:43.405
in perfect order, sir.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.448
I have a full report

13:44.532 --> 13:45.366
on all beach activities,
complete with--

13:45.449 --> 13:47.493
Oh, please, Ryan.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.870
{\an1}Give the big,
bad lifeguard thing a rest.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.247
Recycle that, please.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.624
{\an1}Lifeguarding isn't
about guarding rules.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.126
It's about guarding life.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.753
Ah...

13:57.836 --> 13:58.921
{\an1}sea grass.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.090
(<i> sniffing</i> )

14:01.173 --> 14:02.967
The ocean's potpourri.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.134
Pope-a-who?

14:04.218 --> 14:05.594
People need freedom, Ryan.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.762
Freedom to be themselves.

14:06.845 --> 14:07.763
Freedom to look
in the mirror each day

14:07.846 --> 14:11.767
and say, "Hello,
new best friend."

14:11.850 --> 14:13.894
But Major Madison,
didn't you always say

14:13.978 --> 14:17.231
that a beach without rules is
just a sandbox for unruly fools?

14:17.314 --> 14:19.275
{\an1}That was before
my doctor told me

14:19.358 --> 14:21.235
{\an1}I needed to relax
and enjoy life

14:21.318 --> 14:23.821
{\an1}or I wouldn't get
to relax and enjoy life.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.865
And call me Sparkles.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.117
Sparkles?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.577
It's my new earth name.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.413
{\an1}Starting tomorrow,
you will learn the new way:

14:32.496 --> 14:36.250
{\an1}no rules, no regulations--
only freedom

14:36.333 --> 14:38.127
and complete harmony.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.088
Careful, Tice!

14:41.171 --> 14:43.966
My herbal tea's in there.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.097
No rules.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.684
Have you ever read two more
awesome words in your life?

14:53.767 --> 14:55.144
I haven't
been this stoked

14:55.227 --> 14:57.688
since Raymundo started
serving chili fries.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.356
Hi, I'm Tice.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.734
I'm my new best friend,
and I'd like to be yours.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.861
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay more pleasant

15:03.944 --> 15:05.821
please do not hesitate
to ask.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.197
(<i> all laughing</i> )

15:07.281 --> 15:09.658
Could you put sunscreen
on my back?

15:09.742 --> 15:12.119
There's a place
I can't reach.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.830
{\an1}One more crack like that,
Rodriguez, and I...

15:14.913 --> 15:17.666
Remember, Ryan, invading
someone's personal space

15:17.750 --> 15:18.834
is what I call

15:18.917 --> 15:20.127
a boo-boo big time.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.838
Now, you apologize
to this young man.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.758
S... Sorry.

15:25.841 --> 15:26.300
Live free, kids.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.844
Enjoy your day.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.346
That's an order.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.847
I think you need

15:31.930 --> 15:32.931
a Brazilian mud facial.

15:40.147 --> 15:43.525
{\an1}We are officially
rule-free!

15:43.609 --> 15:48.030
No rules, no worries!

15:49.698 --> 15:53.035
(<i> yelling</i> )

15:53.118 --> 15:54.828
Oh...

15:54.912 --> 15:55.287
Out of the way, goof.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.873
Whoa!

15:57.956 --> 15:59.375
(<i> engine revving</i> )

15:59.458 --> 16:00.167
What's the problem?

16:00.250 --> 16:02.544
{\an1}Swimmers
in the surfing zone.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.712
If memory serves,

16:03.796 --> 16:06.340
this is a violation
of code nine eight six.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.549
Sorry.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.801
"No rules"<i> means</i> no rules.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.803
{\an5}What?! Come on!

16:08.884 --> 16:10.803
What?! Come on!

16:10.886 --> 16:13.389
{\an5}We can't surf!

16:10.886 --> 16:13.389
We can't surf!

16:28.153 --> 16:30.739
Harmony... peace...

16:30.823 --> 16:32.741
I... my new best friend.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.452
I'm... I'm my new... I...

16:35.536 --> 16:36.745
(<i> yelling</i> ):
All right, let's go!

16:36.829 --> 16:39.248
Anybody not on a surfboard

16:39.331 --> 16:40.916
is ordered to clear
this area immediately!

16:40.999 --> 16:44.962
{\an1}Now, clear my grid square,
go, go, go!

16:45.045 --> 16:48.048
Stop, in the
name of life, Ryan!

16:48.132 --> 16:52.219
But, Major...
I mean, Sparkle, sir,

16:52.302 --> 16:54.722
how are we supposed to surf
with all these swimmers around?

16:54.805 --> 16:57.891
Talk it out amongst yourselves.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.017
Get to know each other.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.728
Commune,
exchange recipes.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.146
Right, Ryan?

17:02.229 --> 17:03.480
Yes, sir!

17:03.564 --> 17:06.817
Now, how about we go
and look for some puka shells?

17:06.900 --> 17:08.234
Make you a necklace.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.154
(<i> loud whooshing</i> )

17:11.821 --> 17:13.906
Ow!

17:13.991 --> 17:15.784
Twister:
Man, this reeks!

17:15.867 --> 17:18.704
How can we surf with all
these shoobies around?

17:18.787 --> 17:21.665
Well, we could give Major
Madison's approach a try.

17:21.749 --> 17:22.790
Exchange recipes?

17:22.875 --> 17:26.252
No! Work it out
among ourselves.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.337
{\an1}Excuse me.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.799
{\an1}This area is usually reserved
for surfers

17:30.883 --> 17:34.303
so could you clear out for those
of us who prefer to surf?

17:34.386 --> 17:37.181
(<i> cheerful yelling</i> )

17:37.264 --> 17:38.515
Nice try, Reg.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.976
{\an1}We'll let the master
handle this.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.144
Shark!

17:42.227 --> 17:45.063
(<i> panicked screaming</i> )

17:53.864 --> 17:54.281
Wh-Whoa!

17:58.285 --> 18:00.329
Take off, bro!

18:00.412 --> 18:01.663
This turf is <i> mine!</i>

18:01.747 --> 18:02.748
Yeah, that's right.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.334
So go down there, hey.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.253
{\an5}You can't claim
an area of the
ocean for yourself.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.422
We got no rules, remember?

18:10.506 --> 18:14.843
That means there's no rule
against ruling, and <i> I</i> rule.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.053
Look, let's just go

18:16.136 --> 18:18.347
to the south side
of the pier, okay?

18:18.430 --> 18:20.349
There's usually
no swimmers around there,

18:20.432 --> 18:21.975
{\an3}and we can surf
all we want.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.186
See you later, losers!

18:24.269 --> 18:25.270
(<i> laughter</i> )

18:36.949 --> 18:38.492
(<i> grunts</i> )

18:38.575 --> 18:41.161
Hey. I think
I got something.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.371
Yeah!

18:42.454 --> 18:45.457
Hey, no fishing
on the south side of the pier.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.000
{\an3}Yeah?

18:47.084 --> 18:48.210
Read the sign.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.462
Otto:
"Fish wherever you want.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.381
"Be free! Live free!

18:52.464 --> 18:54.716
Signed, Sparkles"?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.260
(<i> slurping</i> )

18:59.388 --> 19:01.056
(<i> groans</i> )

19:01.139 --> 19:04.143
I am my new best friend,
and I want to be yours.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.687
Would anyone care
for a spritz?

19:06.770 --> 19:09.731
{\an1}Tice, listen,
this "no rules" thing

19:09.815 --> 19:10.816
is a total bust.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.068
{\an1}You got to do something
about Major Mushhead.

19:13.151 --> 19:14.111
I am my new best friend,

19:14.194 --> 19:16.905
and I want to be yours
and his...

19:16.989 --> 19:18.907
{\an1}This is worse
than we thought.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.451
{\an1}We got to get Tice back,
or we're doomed.

19:21.535 --> 19:22.786
You're telling me.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.663
Without rules,
a kid could get hurt out here.

19:24.746 --> 19:25.831
That's it!

19:25.914 --> 19:27.416
We need to show Sparkles

19:27.499 --> 19:31.587
what really happens
when you don't enforce rules,

19:31.670 --> 19:33.422
and I think I know just how.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.925
(<i> rhythmic chanting</i> )

19:37.009 --> 19:39.469
{\an3}(<i> painful</i>
<i>moaning</i> )

19:41.889 --> 19:43.390
Whoa!
What happened?!

19:43.473 --> 19:44.600
What's the matter
with your essence, son?

19:44.683 --> 19:47.603
He got hit by a surfer
while he was swimming.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.146
What?! You're supposed
to work things out.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.940
(<i> softly</i> ):
Exercise your freedom.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.317
We did!

19:53.400 --> 19:55.360
I exercised my freedom to swim

19:55.444 --> 19:58.614
and he exercised his freedom
to run me over

19:58.697 --> 20:00.240
but I don't blame him.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.544
(<i> whistling</i> )

20:14.129 --> 20:16.673
(<i> metal clanging</i> )

20:16.757 --> 20:17.883
Goodnight, nirvana!

20:17.966 --> 20:19.801
The riptide warning flag!

20:23.972 --> 20:25.015
Don't they know

20:25.098 --> 20:27.726
their entire life force
could be in danger?

20:27.809 --> 20:29.102
{\an1}Sure.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.812
Guess they're exercising
their freedom

20:30.896 --> 20:33.106
to ignore it
and have a good time.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.149
But they... but...

20:34.232 --> 20:36.902
(<i> loud rock music plays</i> )

I'm... I-I am... I...

21:07.849 --> 21:10.727
Ryan!

21:11.144 --> 21:11.979
{\an1}Yes, sir?

21:12.062 --> 21:15.482
Restore order at once!

21:15.565 --> 21:17.442
But what about the new way?

21:17.526 --> 21:19.361
Rules <i> are</i> the way, Ryan!

21:19.444 --> 21:20.529
My doctor was
full of patooey!

21:20.612 --> 21:23.532
Never take life advice
from a chiropractor!

21:23.615 --> 21:26.410
{\an1}They don't know a thing
about discipline and order!

21:26.493 --> 21:28.495
{\an1}(<i> yelling</i> ):
Yes, sir!

21:29.621 --> 21:35.043
Red flag flying!
Get out of the water <i> now!</i>

21:35.127 --> 21:38.046
You are violating
code six three four two niner!

21:38.130 --> 21:40.382
{\an3}Move it!
Move it!

21:41.591 --> 21:43.385
Hey, Sparkles

21:43.468 --> 21:45.554
why don't you keep
that maniac on a leash?

21:45.637 --> 21:47.055
Perhaps you
haven't heard!

21:47.139 --> 21:48.223
I'm back in command

21:48.307 --> 21:50.058
and this LZ
belongs to me!

21:50.142 --> 21:53.937
Oh, I, uh, I-I think
I hear my mommy calling me.

21:54.021 --> 21:54.980
Good work, Ryan.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.482
{\an1}I'm going to give Ocean Shores
an "A-plus."

21:57.566 --> 21:58.400
You are hereby

21:58.483 --> 22:00.068
reinstated to your command.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.238
Carry on, lifeguard.

22:03.321 --> 22:05.323
Sir, yes, sir!

22:22.758 --> 22:24.926
You kids are breaking
rule number two six four five.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.137
Which one it that?

22:27.220 --> 22:29.431
Letting a beautiful
day slip away.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.266
{\an5}All right!

22:29.514 --> 22:31.266
Yeah!

22:31.349 --> 22:35.437
{\an1}No walking on the sand!
That means you!

22:35.520 --> 22:36.855
Pull in that fishing rod!

22:36.938 --> 22:38.273
Where's your sunscreen?!

22:38.356 --> 22:40.150
Don't you eyeball me, shoobie!

22:40.233 --> 22:42.778
I want to see nothing but
pinfeathers and flapping wings!

22:42.861 --> 22:46.281
Now move! You seagulls
will clear out now! Move it!

22:46.365 --> 22:48.366
I guess having rules
isn't totally lame.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.326
Guess not.
