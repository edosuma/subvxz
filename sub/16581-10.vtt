WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:04.369
J‘J‘J‘J‘

00:15.433 --> 00:16.548
[sighs]

00:20.104 --> 00:21.640
lshouldn't be here.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.055
| just went along with it

00:24.275 --> 00:26.186
'cause, uh, I didn't want
to cause any more of a scene.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.315
You're right.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.353
No, Mathias had no right
to arrest you off the Res.

00:30.573 --> 00:31.483
That's the good news.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.280
The bad news is, uh...

00:33.493 --> 00:36.860
well, I guess...
everything else.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.076
Right.

00:38.748 --> 00:39.863
So, I'm free to go?

00:40.458 --> 00:41.914
Uh, yes and no.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.745
I mean, yes, you can go,
but Mr. Standing Bear

00:43.920 --> 00:47.128
can still press assault charges
against you in the county.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.706
So I think it might
be worth our while

00:49.884 --> 00:53.251
to try and get this resolved
right here and right now.

00:55.014 --> 00:55.844
Okay.

00:56.057 --> 00:57.718
Just couldn't let
a news cycle go by

00:57.934 --> 00:59.925
without trying to
dominate it, could you?

01:01.938 --> 01:03.394
What the hell happened?

01:05.650 --> 01:07.481
He accused me
of being Hector.

01:08.027 --> 01:10.234
-How does he know?
-Honestly...

01:11.614 --> 01:14.822
I do not know howl have managed
to keep it hidden for this long.

01:15.952 --> 01:17.158
Does he have proof?

01:18.871 --> 01:20.486
He knows he shot me,
but he was trying

01:20.706 --> 01:22.617
to get my shirt off
to see the scar,

01:22.833 --> 01:25.324
so obviously, he does not have
concrete evidence.

01:25.545 --> 01:27.501
Yeah, but he knows
where to find it.

01:30.049 --> 01:31.004
What do you mean?

01:31.217 --> 01:32.798
He was with me
when I collected samples

01:33.010 --> 01:34.716
of your blood
out where you were shot.

01:35.221 --> 01:36.256
[sighs]

01:37.682 --> 01:38.762
Could he get a warrant

01:38.975 --> 01:40.306
and make you turn
it over to him?

01:41.435 --> 01:42.845
This is bad.

01:43.062 --> 01:46.350
A massive public bar brawl.

01:46.524 --> 01:49.061
-Were you drinking?
-A little.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.733
Do you have a history
with this other guy?

01:50.945 --> 01:52.856
Henry?
He's my best friend.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.733
Oh, of course he is.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.447
But he's been lying to me.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.618
Turns out he's been secretly
running around as Hector.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.570
I'm the one who should
be pressing charges here.

02:02.790 --> 02:06.703
Wait. Hector is that violent
reservation vigilante?

02:06.919 --> 02:07.783
Yeah.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.374
Okay, you cannot
let that get out.

02:14.844 --> 02:16.755
-Why not?
-You're already accused

02:16.971 --> 02:19.758
of having a torrid relationship
with your pretty deputy

02:19.974 --> 02:21.054
who breaks the law for you.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.882
Now your best friend
is a vigilante.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.432
Let's try and imagine

02:24.604 --> 02:26.765
how Tucker Baggett
might spin that.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.142
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing?

02:30.568 --> 02:32.274
I think you and | just had
a breakthrough.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.314
Can you get rid
of the evidence?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.562
Not without breaking
another law.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.484
[sighs]

02:43.456 --> 02:45.162
So, what do we do?

02:45.374 --> 02:46.875
Walt threw the
first punch, right?

02:47.043 --> 02:49.580
He doesn't need any more
legal trouble right now.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.286
Maybe if you threaten to press
charges, he'll back down.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.090
He does not seem to be
in a backing-down sort of mood.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.385
Do you think
he'll send you back to prison?

03:00.306 --> 03:01.421
[Wait] I don't know.

03:01.641 --> 03:03.552
I don't know
if he's gonna press charges.

03:03.768 --> 03:05.975
I don't know much about
what he's thinking these days.

03:06.187 --> 03:09.099
Well, I guess
I'd better go find out.

03:09.732 --> 03:12.348
And whatever deal I can make
to get you out of this,

03:12.568 --> 03:14.183
ifl can get you out
of this,

03:14.362 --> 03:15.693
you will promise
to abide by it.

03:15.905 --> 03:16.815
Okay?

03:19.283 --> 03:20.739
[sighs]

03:21.202 --> 03:22.032
Okay?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.368
You know,
you can't hold my client.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.332
You know your sheriff
can't assault people

03:30.544 --> 03:31.829
without consequences.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.332
Does this mean
Henry's gonna press charges?

03:38.427 --> 03:40.042
Not if the sheriff
is willing to drop

03:40.262 --> 03:42.093
this whole
Hector business.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.640
I think we can live
with that.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.931
Okay, then.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.645
So, that's it?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.311
I guess that's it.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.110
[door closes]

04:11.752 --> 04:13.868
J‘J‘J‘J‘

04:44.744 --> 04:46.029
Okay, if you've been
interviewing my client

04:46.203 --> 04:47.909
the whole time that
you've kept me waiting in here,

04:48.080 --> 04:49.661
I won't just have
his statement thrown out.

04:49.874 --> 04:51.330
I will bring suit
against your department.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.659
Relax. Darius Burns
isn't talking to anybody.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.164
Sorry to make you wait.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.495
It wasn't intentional.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.376
Come on, I'm not stupid.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.801
l was pulled away
by a pretty unusual situation.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.048
Which was what?

05:07.600 --> 05:08.760
Ask your dad.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.434
What exactly are the charges

05:12.605 --> 05:13.765
that are being brought
against my client?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.482
We suspect him
of being involved

05:15.691 --> 05:17.306
with the disappearance
of Malachi Strand.

05:17.485 --> 05:20.192
You suspect him
of being involved.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.273
That's nowhere near sufficient
for you to hold him.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.442
Cady, I know
all of the arguments

05:24.658 --> 05:27.786
about every individual being
entitled to a good defense,

05:28.204 --> 05:31.037
but trust me on this--

05:31.248 --> 05:32.954
You do not want
to take Darius on as a client.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.456
He's a bad guy.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.044
You really don't know
all the arguments

05:36.253 --> 05:38.505
about everybody being entitled
to a good defense.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.839
So release him, okay?
Now.

05:42.718 --> 05:45.551
You came to me a while back
wanting to help our community.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.461
-Yeah, I remember.
-[Mathias] Do you?

05:47.640 --> 05:51.224
'Cause helping Darius Burns--
That's not gonna help anybody.

05:54.980 --> 05:59.440
J‘J‘J‘J‘

05:59.652 --> 06:01.438
[sighs]

06:10.621 --> 06:12.953
And here I was worried
I was gonna wake you up.

06:14.875 --> 06:15.830
[grunts]

06:18.254 --> 06:19.243
[sighs]

06:20.714 --> 06:22.045
Donna, what are you
doing here?

06:22.758 --> 06:24.339
What happened
to your face?

06:29.139 --> 06:30.640
I lost my temper.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.219
That's all
you're gonna say?

06:36.188 --> 06:37.724
I'll tell you the rest
some other time.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.772
Better question is, uh,

06:40.985 --> 06:41.895
what are you doing here
so early?

06:43.028 --> 06:44.529
Well, l-l tried
to reach you,

06:44.738 --> 06:46.444
and when I couldn't,
I just came out

06:46.657 --> 06:53.620
'cause I, uh-- I need to talk
to you about this.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.076
Tucker Baggett.

06:57.293 --> 06:59.875
-What did he send you?
-He sent me a subpoena.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.001
He wants to depose me
in your civil suit,

07:02.214 --> 07:04.170
and l have no idea why.

07:07.761 --> 07:12.130
Tucker, um, probably found out
about something

07:12.349 --> 07:15.716
that, um, Vic and I did
while you were missing.

07:17.021 --> 07:19.637
[sighs]
W-W-Well, what exactly?

07:21.567 --> 07:23.273
We took some
of your patient files

07:24.069 --> 07:27.232
without, you know,
permission.

07:29.450 --> 07:33.068
Oh. Well, I can see
why that would be a problem.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.238
If we hadn't have done it,
we might not have found you.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.245
No, I know. I know.
ljust, um--

07:40.461 --> 07:41.746
I kind of wish
you hadn't told me

07:41.921 --> 07:44.754
because now I either
have to lie under oath

07:44.924 --> 07:46.585
-or just--
-You don't have to lie
for me.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.375
Well, thank you.
I...

07:50.763 --> 07:52.924
Look, you know what?
H can just drag my feet

07:53.140 --> 07:54.050
and try to put
the deposition off.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.381
-No.
-lt's...

07:56.185 --> 08:00.144
No, I'd rather know how bad
things are sooner than later.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.812
Was your life this chaotic
before we started dating?

08:18.457 --> 08:20.493
[fanfare plays]

08:20.709 --> 08:22.370
[Chip] Sheriff's deputies
in Sublette County

08:22.586 --> 08:24.827
exchanged gunfire
with a bank robber yesterday

08:25.047 --> 08:27.754
who matches the description
of a multi-state bank robber,

08:27.967 --> 08:29.207
Cowboy Bill.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.045
And in Durant, reporters

08:33.138 --> 08:35.675
were shocked to find a verdict
handed down this morning

08:35.891 --> 08:39.224
after the jury deliberated
for only two hours yesterday.

08:40.062 --> 08:43.225
The verdict --
guilty on all charges.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.852
I'm Chip Kendall.
We 'Il be back after this.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.150
[Ruby]
Morning, Walter.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.273
The mayor called for you
yesterday,

08:54.493 --> 08:56.734
as did Donna--
a couple times.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.660
I already talked to Donna
this morning.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.999
Hey, Sheriff.
Did you hear the good news?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.124
No.
I don't think I did.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.251
So, what's the
good news, Ferg?

09:06.922 --> 09:08.787
Chance Gilbert
was found guilty.

09:09.008 --> 09:11.545
The jury only deliberated
for two hours.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.137
I don't understand.
The trial's over?

09:17.349 --> 09:18.850
I never even testified.

09:19.435 --> 09:20.515
Yeah, I mean,
I guess A.D.A. Holder

09:20.728 --> 09:22.719
just decided that she didn't
need your testimony.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.144
You mean she didn't want it.

09:24.690 --> 09:25.896
Who cares? Right?

09:26.108 --> 09:28.474
I mean, Chance is going away
for 20 to life,

09:28.694 --> 09:30.685
which is certainly good
for your lawsuit.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.477
I mean, think about it.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.907
I mean, the accusations
that he made against you, Walt--

09:37.119 --> 09:40.031
Now they're just officially
the ravings of a psycho.

09:40.706 --> 09:43.072
Which means we can start
focusing on finding Malachi

09:43.292 --> 09:44.782
and tracking down
the new Hector.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.791
I started pulling files
on reported sightings.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.623
There's no need for that.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.750
-Oh. Did you already do it?
-[Wa|t] No.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.336
I had a little time
to think. Um...

09:54.261 --> 09:55.876
I feel I may have, uh,
jumped the gun

09:56.096 --> 09:57.927
with this whole
Hector theory.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.676
Seriously? Because yesterday
you thought

09:59.892 --> 10:01.632
that Hector was our best suspect
in Malachi's disappearance.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.889
I know.
But today I'm rethinking that.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.934
Truth is nobody's even
reported Malachi missing.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.641
Um, I think I maybe
just needed

10:10.861 --> 10:12.897
a distraction
from Barlow's lawsuit.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.978
Okay, well,
Malachi or no Malachi,

10:15.199 --> 10:17.155
these Hector attacks
are connected.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.493
Why don't we just look
into that?

10:18.702 --> 10:20.238
'Cause I said not to.

10:21.455 --> 10:25.664
Walt, you got a call
from the Tri-County Jail.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.085
-Who is it?
-|t's Chance Gilbert.

10:32.508 --> 10:35.295
He wants to talk to you
in person.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.446
Hey.
Thanks, Frank.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.775
I like this new security guard
better than the last one.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.701
Yeah, I don't think Eamonn
will be back.

11:03.914 --> 11:07.406
My, uh, period of détente
with the sheriff's office

11:07.626 --> 11:09.537
was breathtakingly brief.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.702
What can I do
for you, man?

11:12.714 --> 11:13.794
Level with me.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.213
Well, now, that's all
I've ever done.

11:20.973 --> 11:23.134
After we left Malachi
out at that cliff,

11:23.892 --> 11:25.553
did you go back
and kill him?

11:28.856 --> 11:30.972
You've been talking
to your friend, the sheriff.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.481
lam not certain
he is still my friend,

11:33.694 --> 11:35.525
but you have not answered
my question.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.905
The answer is no.
I did not kill Malachi.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.241
And I didn't send anyone else
to do it, either.

11:44.288 --> 11:46.074
And while I'm used
to Walt Longmire

11:46.290 --> 11:47.405
imagining
that I'm at the heart

11:47.624 --> 11:49.615
of all sorts
of elaborate conspiracies,

11:49.835 --> 11:51.871
I'm kind of
surprised at you, Henry,

11:52.504 --> 11:54.881
especially after I helped you
get your bar back.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.591
And lam grateful for that.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.179
But some of the details of this
situation do not make sense.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.095
[sighs]

12:08.312 --> 12:10.724
Like "Hector lives"

12:10.939 --> 12:14.306
being spelled out in stones
out where we banished Malachi.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.476
-Yes.
-Has it occurred to you

12:17.696 --> 12:20.028
that Malachi might have
done that himself

12:20.240 --> 12:24.358
to make it look like Hector
did something bad to him?

12:24.578 --> 12:26.534
Why would Malachi
fake his own disappearance

12:26.747 --> 12:29.113
-and try to pin it on Hector?
-To make people believe

12:29.333 --> 12:33.576
that he is gone
and no longer a threat.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.456
J‘J‘J‘J‘

12:35.672 --> 12:37.458
Which makes him
more of a threat than ever.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.513
You might want to invest
in a couple of these guys.

12:56.318 --> 12:57.649
[buzzer]

13:06.119 --> 13:10.078
Permission to remove
these shackles, Sheriff.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.327
We really don't recommend
removing these chains, Sheriff.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.501
[sighs]
It's fine.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.261
[chains clacking]

13:26.640 --> 13:27.971
We'll be right outside.

13:28.850 --> 13:29.805
Thanks.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.685
Thank you for coming,
Sheriff.
[door closes]

13:37.901 --> 13:39.277
Tell me why I'm
here, Chance.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.436
Well, you heard
the verdict?

13:43.657 --> 13:44.942
ldid.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.443
It sounded fair to me.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.070
20 years to life?

13:48.245 --> 13:50.156
That's what the
statute calls for.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.112
But for me,
20 years is life.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.324
That's all
I might have left.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.330
Well, you should have made
better choices.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.417
That's why you're here.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.966
I want you to do
something for me.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.545
Why would I do
anything for you?

14:09.599 --> 14:13.057
Because you were born
in the wrong time, just like me.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.806
[chuckles]
Yeah,

14:15.022 --> 14:17.980
we should have lived
like two centuries ago, right?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.568
[chuckles]
When freedom and liberty

14:20.777 --> 14:26.363
weren't platitudes trotted out
by some corrupt politicians.

14:27.326 --> 14:29.032
I'm not like you, Chance.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.951
Of course you are.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.454
We fought a duel,
like men of honor.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.409
Yes, you were Hamilton.
I was Jefferson.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.413
Jefferson never
fought a duel.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.917
That was Aaron Burr.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.419
But the point remains.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.011
You and l, we understand

14:47.220 --> 14:52.510
that "live free or die"
is not a bumper sticker.

14:53.018 --> 14:57.887
It's a choice that we
got to make every day.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.188
You pretend
you don't understand me,

15:00.400 --> 15:03.688
but that home of yours,
that remote cabin--

15:04.488 --> 15:05.944
You wouldn't live there

15:06.156 --> 15:09.774
if you didn't miss the way
this country used to be.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.699
What exactly do you want me
to do for you?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.499
I want you to get me
transferred.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.414
To where?

15:23.632 --> 15:24.747
Death row.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.417
Well, I don't have
that authority.

15:30.389 --> 15:31.845
Come on, Sheriff.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.506
I need you
to do this for me.

15:35.560 --> 15:39.394
To be confined,
deprived of my freedom...

15:41.149 --> 15:44.357
unable to feel the soil
between my fingers,

15:44.569 --> 15:47.857
under my nails [inhales]

15:48.073 --> 15:51.110
or to smell a
rainstorm approaching...

15:52.077 --> 15:53.283
that's not living.

15:54.246 --> 15:58.489
That's the very definition
of cruel, unusual punishment.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.958
I can't, Sheriff.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.910
I can't live like this.

16:05.841 --> 16:10.426
So if you can't live free,
you choose to die.

16:12.556 --> 16:15.719
Well, that seems a little
extreme, even for you.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.097
Desperate men
do desperate things.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.027
The idea of living
my life behind bars

16:34.161 --> 16:36.072
even one year of my life...

16:37.330 --> 16:39.321
I don't think
I could face that.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.156
That would be pure hell.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.581
And given
what you did to Vic...

16:46.756 --> 16:49.213
...it's exactly
what you deserve.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.547
-Guard.
-No, Sheriff.

16:56.766 --> 16:57.892
-Ready.
-[buzzer]

16:58.101 --> 17:00.057
Don't, Sheriff.
Sheriff, don't.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.760
Sheriff,
I need your help!

17:02.522 --> 17:04.433
Sheriff! Please!

17:04.649 --> 17:06.856
-[screams]
-[buzzer]

17:08.236 --> 17:10.773
Sheriff, don't walk
out of here! Please!

17:11.448 --> 17:13.029
I'll see you in 20 years.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.400
[handcuffs click]

17:16.620 --> 17:18.702
Bastard!
[grunts]

17:23.168 --> 17:25.875
[footsteps approaching]
[QaSpS]

17:32.344 --> 17:34.551
Oh. Hey, Walt.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.719
You just getting back
from Tri-County?

17:37.641 --> 17:38.255
Yeah.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.601
So, what did Chance want?

17:50.820 --> 17:51.900
Uh...

17:54.407 --> 17:55.237
Mercy.

17:57.202 --> 18:00.319
He wanted me to help get him
moved to death row.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.663
What, he wants the death
penaHy?

18:03.875 --> 18:06.116
Captivity for him
is like torture.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.292
He'd-- He'd rather die.

18:10.006 --> 18:10.995
Wow.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.874
Are you gonna help him?

18:14.386 --> 18:15.296
No.

18:16.221 --> 18:18.553
The judge has already
handed down his sentence.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.510
It's done. It's not for me
to interfere with the law.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.389
That kind of behavior's been
getting me into trouble.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.855
Yeah, right.
[knock on door]

18:30.068 --> 18:33.902
Walt? The mayor is
here to see you.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.194
Sawyer?

18:36.408 --> 18:37.614
What's he want?

18:38.535 --> 18:39.775
To see you.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.622
[clears throat]

18:52.716 --> 18:55.082
You know, I tried playing
football when l was a freshman.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.715
-Fancied myself a linebacker.
-How'd that work out?

18:58.930 --> 19:01.637
Well, I got my bell rung
just about every play for a year

19:01.850 --> 19:03.932
before I realized
debate was more my speed.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.009
[chuckles]

19:06.229 --> 19:07.435
After every game, my dad

19:07.606 --> 19:09.221
would buy me
one of these milkshakes

19:09.566 --> 19:12.228
just to make me feel better
about getting my butt kicked.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.356
So, what are you trying
to make me feel better about?

19:15.905 --> 19:17.987
Well, can't get anything
past you.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.575
That's my job.

19:19.784 --> 19:20.614
Right.

19:21.536 --> 19:24.278
-So, you know I'm up
for re-election soon.
-I do.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.237
And you know better
than anybody

19:26.458 --> 19:27.948
what a pain in the ass
that can be,

19:28.168 --> 19:29.704
especially these days.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.534
It's a bad time
to be an incumbent.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.495
How you doing, Bruce?
Good to see you.

19:34.299 --> 19:38.417
Sawyer, why did you buy me
a milkshake?

19:40.639 --> 19:43.221
This morning, | directed
the county commissioners

19:43.433 --> 19:44.798
to submit a request
to the governor

19:45.018 --> 19:47.384
to have you temporarily
removed from office.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.520
Sawyer, what the hell
are you talking about?

19:50.732 --> 19:52.768
It's only temporary.
All right?

19:52.984 --> 19:56.397
Just while this wrongful death
lawsuit plays itself out.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.070
But between that and all the
stuff in the papers recently,

19:59.240 --> 20:00.650
you've become
the most visible way

20:00.867 --> 20:03.233
for me to lay out my
anti-corruption platform.

20:03.787 --> 20:04.993
Anti-corruption?

20:06.081 --> 20:07.912
Sawyer, you know me
better than that.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.323
I've been doing this job
for years.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.999
Nobody's ever accused me
of anything

20:12.212 --> 20:14.043
except being a bad
public speaker.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.756
Walt,
this isn't personal.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.711
I think the world of you.
You know that.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.627
But we're public figures,
and your public reputation,

20:21.846 --> 20:24.007
well, it's--
it's not what it used to be.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.014
Look, I've had a bad
couple of weeks,

20:26.226 --> 20:29.263
but once I get a chance
to make my case--

20:32.774 --> 20:34.605
But I got to play the odds
right now.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.689
And when that FBI evidence comes
out, you're gonna be toxic.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.360
What FBI evidence?

20:44.536 --> 20:46.993
Did Tucker Baggett tell you
something about my case?

20:47.163 --> 20:49.620
Look, I've already said
more than I should.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.664
You tell me what the hell
Baggett told you, Sawyer!

20:51.876 --> 20:53.741
Don't you snap at me, Walt.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.081
Now, I could have blindsided you
with this, but I didn't.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.503
I'm slow-walking
this process

20:57.716 --> 20:59.126
through the
county commissioners.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.503
And I could have gone
to the governor himself.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.336
I'm doing that out of
the respect I have for you.

21:04.556 --> 21:07.423
The least you could do is
show me some respect in return.

21:12.397 --> 21:15.355
J‘J‘J‘J‘

21:26.619 --> 21:28.120
What's all this?

21:33.209 --> 21:35.120
This is where I meditate.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.628
To what do I owe the honor?

21:39.799 --> 21:42.586
Well, um, I wanted to tell you
that I reached out to the people

21:42.761 --> 21:44.717
that you recommended
for the jobs

21:44.929 --> 21:47.636
and that they're all gonna start
in the next week or two.

21:47.849 --> 21:48.929
Great.
That's great.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.848
-Thank you for doing that.
-Mm-hmm.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.096
I also wanted to ask
your blessing

21:53.313 --> 21:54.849
to add one more name
to the list.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.680
You found somebody
with legal experience?

21:57.901 --> 22:02.645
No, no, but...
she shows real initiative.

22:03.865 --> 22:04.695
Okay.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.744
I'll add one more employee
to the budget.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.284
Thank you.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.292
Was there something else?

22:20.757 --> 22:21.542
No.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.591
Well, actually, uh...

22:30.683 --> 22:32.674
Actually, it's--
it's my dad.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.430
What about him?

22:35.939 --> 22:37.395
I'm worried about him...

22:38.399 --> 22:39.184
and you.

22:41.402 --> 22:42.437
Well, you know.

22:44.656 --> 22:48.524
Your dad and I
have always been

22:48.743 --> 22:51.985
on opposite sides
of pretty much everything.

22:52.163 --> 22:53.152
Yeah, I know.

22:55.667 --> 22:56.907
I love my dad.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.960
But I don't always
agree with him.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.287
And N don't
want you to think

23:02.507 --> 23:06.170
that H share
his feelings about you.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.297
Well, I don't.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.797
You say that now.

23:13.226 --> 23:16.309
But he's acting...
differently.

23:17.105 --> 23:21.269
He's really fixated on you
in an unhealthy way.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.692
And maybe I'm overreacting,
but I-I...

23:25.822 --> 23:28.609
I'm worried that things
between the two of you

23:28.825 --> 23:30.440
are only
going to get worse.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.241
I appreciate the warning.

23:33.955 --> 23:36.697
But as you can see,
I've, uh--

23:36.916 --> 23:39.157
I've taken steps
to make sure I'm safe.

23:42.255 --> 23:45.292
These guards are here
to protect you from my dad?

23:46.551 --> 23:48.041
Cady.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.797
[breathes deeply]

23:50.013 --> 23:55.599
Nobody knows what threats
the world holds for them.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.429
You can't know.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.387
All you can do
is surround yourself

24:00.607 --> 24:03.895
with people you trust
to look after you.

24:05.403 --> 24:07.268
And the fact
that you're here

24:07.488 --> 24:09.695
tells me that you're one
of those people.

24:11.284 --> 24:14.276
J‘J‘J‘J‘

24:16.456 --> 24:17.946
[buzzer]

24:20.126 --> 24:20.956
Thanks.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.501
[laughs]

24:24.714 --> 24:27.251
When they told me
I had a visitor,

24:27.467 --> 24:30.959
I never thought
it would be Victoria Moretti.

24:31.679 --> 24:34.136
Permission to remove
my shackles?

24:34.349 --> 24:35.589
No.

24:35.808 --> 24:39.300
Oh, so you came here
just to spit on me, right?

24:39.520 --> 24:42.387
I'm sure it makes you happy
to see me humiliated,

24:42.607 --> 24:43.847
chained up like an animal.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.065
Yeah, it does.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.734
That's not why
I'm here, though.

24:50.698 --> 24:53.235
No?
So do tell.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.693
Walt told me
what you asked him.

24:57.914 --> 25:00.030
He also said
he told you no.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.246
I'm a little bit more
supportive of the idea.

25:05.755 --> 25:07.746
Then you and I need privacy.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.711
Can you give us a minute?

25:15.223 --> 25:16.633
[buzzer]

25:21.437 --> 25:23.018
All right, let me guess.

25:23.231 --> 25:28.191
The sheriff won't risk
helping me out himself,

25:28.361 --> 25:30.352
but he's willing to send
his little plaything

25:30.571 --> 25:31.651
to do it for him.

25:32.532 --> 25:33.897
Walt doesn't know I'm here.

25:35.410 --> 25:36.775
Nor would he approve.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.361
I don't understand.
You-- You want to help me?

25:40.915 --> 25:43.247
I don't want to help you.
I want you to die.

25:44.127 --> 25:46.038
I want to wipe you
off the face of this earth

25:46.254 --> 25:48.085
so I never have to think
about you again.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.880
Tomato, to-mah-to.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.670
How do I get you moved
to death row?

25:53.886 --> 26:00.052
Well, you can add murder
to my record.

26:01.019 --> 26:01.724
How?

26:03.021 --> 26:06.605
The federal census worker
you found in my freezer--

26:06.816 --> 26:07.646
I killed him.

26:07.859 --> 26:10.225
Yeah.
[clicks tongue]

26:10.403 --> 26:13.190
I can tell you exactly
where to find the gun.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.615
It'll have my
DNA on it, for sure.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.067
Then why don't
you just confess?

26:19.287 --> 26:22.120
Well, I've tried.
Nobody believes me.

26:22.749 --> 26:26.241
They think I'm just trying to
get myself over to death row.

26:26.669 --> 26:27.749
You are.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.328
Hence my problem.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.338
So, get your crazy wife
to do it.

26:33.551 --> 26:38.090
She's not my wife,
but she was my brother's wife.

26:38.306 --> 26:42.140
And neither she or any other
member of my extended family

26:42.351 --> 26:45.684
is willing to do anything
to shorten my life.

26:45.897 --> 26:50.607
They'll hold onto this misguided
hope that I'll be set free.

26:53.196 --> 26:56.404
You see, it can't be anybody
who loves me.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.857
It's got to be someone
who hates me.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.244
Well, you found her.

27:07.877 --> 27:08.866
[door closes]

27:55.842 --> 27:56.752
Hey, Ferg.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.835
Um, could I borrow your car?

28:00.429 --> 28:01.714
The Charger? Sure.

28:01.931 --> 28:04.297
Uh, no.
The Trans Am.

28:06.853 --> 28:07.683
Okay.

28:08.437 --> 28:09.142
Thanks.

28:09.772 --> 28:10.761
Ferg.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.306
I need you to find
someone for me.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.187
Sure. Who?

28:15.361 --> 28:16.271
Monte.

28:17.822 --> 28:19.028
What for?

28:21.701 --> 28:22.656
Good talk!

28:27.373 --> 28:28.579
Here you go.

28:28.791 --> 28:31.077
I think it's got like
a quarter tank of gas in it.

28:31.294 --> 28:32.875
Great. I'll have it
back to you tonight.

28:33.087 --> 28:33.872
[keys thud]

28:37.925 --> 28:39.836
[knock on door, door opens]

28:40.052 --> 28:41.178
Walt?

28:45.224 --> 28:46.088
Are you okay?

28:47.643 --> 28:48.894
[door closes]

28:50.396 --> 28:51.306
No.

28:53.316 --> 28:54.396
What happened?

28:55.860 --> 28:57.566
They're coming after
my job.

28:58.362 --> 28:59.693
Who's "they"?

28:59.906 --> 29:02.147
The mayor,
the county commissioners.

29:02.366 --> 29:05.108
They're petitioning
the governor

29:05.328 --> 29:08.570
to have me
temporarily suspended.

29:10.625 --> 29:14.368
And then, uh,
if I lose my case...

29:14.587 --> 29:17.750
-You won't.
-Well, if I lose my case,

29:18.633 --> 29:21.420
the suspension, uh,
becomes permanent.

29:22.386 --> 29:23.341
I'll be out.

29:24.305 --> 29:25.670
And it's my own fault.

29:28.226 --> 29:29.306
I thought it was enough

29:29.518 --> 29:35.479
just to try to...
do the right thing.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.485
Walt, you told me before

29:39.820 --> 29:42.106
that the truth has got to count
for something.

29:43.908 --> 29:46.194
And as bad as things looked
a couple days ago,

29:46.410 --> 29:48.617
Chance Gilbert
was found guilty.

29:48.829 --> 29:50.444
People can still tell
the difference

29:50.665 --> 29:53.498
between a good person
and a bad person.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.126
So no matter how much bullshit
they spin about you in court,

29:57.338 --> 30:01.172
people look at you, and they can
just tell, all right?

30:02.843 --> 30:05.095
They can tell
that you're a good person.

30:11.602 --> 30:14.594
I want you to step away
from all this, Vic.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.013
It's gotten political.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.313
There's no need for you
to be tarred

30:18.484 --> 30:19.940
with the same brush as me.

30:21.279 --> 30:22.564
So, what, you--

30:24.448 --> 30:26.154
You just want me
to let you crash and burn

30:26.325 --> 30:29.362
-and save myself?
-Yeah.

30:31.038 --> 30:31.743
Yeah.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.579
Even if you were guilty...

30:40.881 --> 30:42.417
...I couldn't do that.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.011
[lock disengages]

31:03.571 --> 31:04.230
Hey, Cady.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.279
Mandy.
H-How did you get in?

31:07.491 --> 31:08.867
-Keys.
-How did you--

31:09.076 --> 31:10.236
I had some made
at the hardware store.

31:10.453 --> 31:11.568
You needed spares.

31:12.413 --> 31:13.368
-Mandy.
-I know.

31:13.581 --> 31:15.196
I should have told you
I was doing that.

31:15.416 --> 31:17.156
Yeah, you absolutely
should have.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.116
And what's more
is that you keep showing up here

31:19.337 --> 31:20.827
every day without being asked,

31:21.005 --> 31:22.791
and it's just--
It's not okay.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.667
Sorry.
|-| thought I was helping.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.253
No, you are.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.885
What's not okay
is that I'm not paying you.

31:33.642 --> 31:38.306
Mandy, I-I want to hire you
full time, with benefits.

31:39.899 --> 31:40.854
Why?

31:41.067 --> 31:44.776
Because you--
you might be a little raw,

31:45.488 --> 31:48.651
but you're dedicated,
and you've shown initiative.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.361
And you're obviously gonna show
up here every day anyway,

31:51.577 --> 31:53.442
so why not just
make it official?

31:56.248 --> 31:57.078
How much?

31:57.541 --> 31:58.951
I'm not gonna work
for minimum wage.

31:59.168 --> 32:00.499
I wouldn't let anyone.

32:01.212 --> 32:03.578
Let's start with 25 a year
and see how it goes.

32:04.382 --> 32:05.997
$25,000?

32:06.217 --> 32:07.206
Yeah.

32:08.761 --> 32:11.127
I got to-- I got to put
these away.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.510
[chuckles]

33:34.305 --> 33:35.511
[grunts]

33:45.399 --> 33:46.730
Okay. Eight.

33:46.942 --> 33:50.526
One, two, three, four,

33:50.738 --> 33:55.482
five, six, seven, eight.

34:35.366 --> 34:38.324
Hey! [grunts]
That is not yours!

34:41.121 --> 34:44.158
[wheezing]

34:46.418 --> 34:47.578
I've been following you,

34:47.795 --> 34:49.877
so I know your
boyfriend, the sheriff,

34:50.089 --> 34:51.875
isn't here to help you
this time.

34:58.847 --> 34:59.632
Ohh!

35:01.559 --> 35:03.641
[coughing]

35:14.822 --> 35:15.652
Shit.

35:15.864 --> 35:19.106
[panting]

35:20.452 --> 35:24.570
So, what did Tucker Baggett
ask you?

35:25.207 --> 35:27.368
Well, he did not ask me
any questions

35:27.585 --> 35:29.917
about the illegal theft
of patient files.

35:30.129 --> 35:31.539
-Thanks.
-Okay.

35:31.755 --> 35:32.744
Mmm.

35:33.757 --> 35:34.746
That's good.

35:35.551 --> 35:38.668
He was, however, quite
interested in other subjects.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.013
Such as?

35:40.514 --> 35:41.754
Such as how long

35:41.974 --> 35:44.966
after you had cleared me
as a suspected drug dealer

35:45.185 --> 35:47.221
did you and I start dating?

35:48.230 --> 35:50.972
Yeah. The predatory sheriff

35:51.191 --> 35:53.443
let you off in
exchange for sexual favors.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.028
More or less, yeah.

35:57.865 --> 36:01.323
He also asked me
if you and I were dating

36:02.745 --> 36:05.361
at the same time
that your deputy

36:05.581 --> 36:07.697
was seen kissing you
in the hospital.

36:08.459 --> 36:09.494
Oh.

36:09.710 --> 36:12.372
Walt, it's okay.
Really.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.670
I mean, I always knew
that she had a thing for you,

36:14.840 --> 36:17.707
but I'm just--
I'm really sorry

36:17.885 --> 36:19.796
that I couldn't
be more helpful,

36:20.012 --> 36:21.468
because I feel like

36:21.680 --> 36:23.056
I fell into every one
of his traps.

36:23.974 --> 36:24.679
I'm sorry.

36:24.892 --> 36:29.056
You know, um, it doesn't
matter what you said.

36:29.271 --> 36:30.886
The deeper I get
into this thing,

36:31.106 --> 36:32.767
the less the truth
seems to matter.

36:33.776 --> 36:37.769
Well, truth is
subjective, isn't it?

36:37.988 --> 36:40.229
No.
No, it's not.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.942
You don't think it shifts
depending on your perspective

36:45.120 --> 36:47.156
or your memory
or others' memories?

36:47.623 --> 36:49.739
People can play games
with it if they want,

36:49.958 --> 36:53.086
but the truth is the truth.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.870
You know what?
That's a great idea.

36:56.090 --> 36:57.330
We should play a game.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.800
We should play
Truth or Dare.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.546
Oh, come on. We already tried
making out in your car.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.676
This is just a natural
progression from that.

37:05.015 --> 37:06.516
Tell you what.
You go first.

37:06.684 --> 37:08.015
Truth or dare?

37:08.894 --> 37:11.886
Fine. Truth.

37:14.483 --> 37:17.941
Who's the better kisser--
Vic or me?

37:21.907 --> 37:23.818
[laughing] Oh, my God.

37:24.451 --> 37:25.782
You could--
You had to take a drink?

37:25.994 --> 37:27.279
You couldn't answer
the question?

37:27.496 --> 37:29.703
-No, I was just thirsty.
-Oh, uh-huh.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.746
And now you're trying to cover
it up with a terrible lie.

37:31.959 --> 37:32.948
You're terrible at lying.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.250
-l'm not lying. ljust...
-Mm-hmm.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.327
-That was a drink to have a drink.
-Okay, great.
It's my turn. My turn.

37:37.548 --> 37:38.537
I choose truth.

37:39.925 --> 37:40.789
Okay.

37:43.137 --> 37:47.847
Who's the better kisser--
me or your ex-husband?

37:51.353 --> 37:53.765
-Yeah, okay.
-Yeah.
Go ahead and take a drink.

37:53.981 --> 37:56.313
[both laugh]

37:56.483 --> 37:58.144
You were right.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.021
This is a really fun game.

38:00.863 --> 38:02.148
I'm sorry.

38:02.322 --> 38:04.984
-[chuckles]
-I guess it's just sort of an--

38:05.200 --> 38:07.942
an awkward way to force
a conversation that--

38:08.120 --> 38:09.155
I don't know.

38:09.371 --> 38:10.747
Well, there's no need
to force it.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.948
You got something to say,
just go on ahead.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.170
All right.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.417
-Ahh.
-Ahh.

38:25.888 --> 38:27.799
What are we
doing here, Walt?

38:29.975 --> 38:32.011
Well, we're, uh,
examining

38:32.227 --> 38:36.266
the slippery subjectivity
of truth.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.932
I meant this.
You and me.

38:40.152 --> 38:44.486
You know, we're not really
a thing, are we, but...

38:44.698 --> 38:46.905
Well, it's definitely a thing.
It's just...

38:51.455 --> 38:53.867
Maybe it's not the kind of thing
we want it to be.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.752
I know I really like you.

38:59.421 --> 39:00.456
I know.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.213
[both chuckle]

39:03.425 --> 39:06.007
But I do think it's time
to shit or get off the pot.

39:06.220 --> 39:06.959
Yeah.

39:08.055 --> 39:11.218
-I'd go with "fish or cut bait."
-[chuckles]

39:11.433 --> 39:14.516
Yeah, well, neither is exactly
dripping with romance, is it?

39:19.316 --> 39:24.527
Well, I was, um-- I was talking
to a guy earlier today,

39:24.738 --> 39:28.401
and he said, uh,

39:28.617 --> 39:31.609
that both he and I
were born in the wrong time.

39:32.913 --> 39:34.574
lthink, um...

39:37.334 --> 39:42.294
...you and I might have just met
each other at the wrong time.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.754
Mm.

39:48.512 --> 39:49.627
[breathes deeply]

40:04.653 --> 40:05.813
[Travis] Vic?

40:06.280 --> 40:07.941
Hey, uh, Vic?

40:09.908 --> 40:11.614
Travis,
what are you doing here?

40:11.827 --> 40:12.987
Uh, moving in.

40:13.954 --> 40:16.161
Oh, my God. You look terrible.
Are-- Are you okay?

40:16.373 --> 40:17.613
Well, physically.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.414
I mean, obviously,
you're still hot, but--

40:19.626 --> 40:21.412
-Hey, you can't move in
next door.
-Don't worry. I'm not.

40:21.628 --> 40:23.289
I rented the place,
uh, three slips down.

40:23.505 --> 40:24.711
I know you need
your privacy,

40:24.882 --> 40:27.043
and you won't see me
unless you need help.

40:27.676 --> 40:28.335
Okay.

40:29.511 --> 40:31.126
I can't deal with this
right now.

40:31.847 --> 40:33.803
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.971
-What the hell happened?
-Nothing.
I got in a little scrape.

40:38.186 --> 40:39.847
You're holding your stomach.
Did you get hit?

40:40.814 --> 40:42.054
[stammers] Sort of.

40:42.274 --> 40:43.389
-All right, show me.
-Travis, stop.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.349
-You stop.
-Stop.

40:45.569 --> 40:46.979
Look!
You got a bruise here!

40:47.195 --> 40:49.026
-Okay.
-Did someone punch you
in the stomach?

40:49.239 --> 40:50.319
No.

40:50.532 --> 40:51.647
Okay?

40:52.409 --> 40:53.740
I got kicked.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.863
Oh, God.
Um, all right.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.660
Uh, we got to get you
to the hospital right now.

40:57.873 --> 41:00.740
-|'m driving.
-Okay, all right.
I am fine, all right?

41:00.959 --> 41:02.119
It's just a little red.

41:02.586 --> 41:04.247
What if you're having
a miscarriage?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.041
I think I would know.

41:07.257 --> 41:08.087
How?

41:08.967 --> 41:10.753
I-I don't know, all right?

41:10.969 --> 41:12.550
But this-- this is all sorts

41:12.721 --> 41:16.384
of crazy amounts
of inappropriate, okay?

41:16.600 --> 41:19.467
You can't--
You can't move in next door.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.636
And I don't need you
taking me to the hospital.

41:22.522 --> 41:24.353
ljust need
to get some sleep.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.148
-Fine.
-[sighs]

41:28.195 --> 41:29.810
You go to sleep, but I'm taking
you to the hospital

41:30.030 --> 41:31.190
first thing in the morning.

41:34.993 --> 41:35.857
Good night.

41:37.996 --> 41:38.906
[door closes]

42:05.315 --> 42:06.771
Any sign of Malachi?

42:07.401 --> 42:08.356
[Henry] No.

42:09.736 --> 42:11.237
But I think
our Malachi problem

42:11.405 --> 42:14.647
is not quite the Malachi problem
we have been imagining.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.572
Meaning?

42:16.785 --> 42:18.491
I believe he's alive.

42:19.371 --> 42:20.531
Well, if that's true,

42:20.747 --> 42:22.408
we don't have
a Malachi problem at all.

42:22.624 --> 42:24.489
But we do.
I think Malachi is the one

42:24.710 --> 42:26.996
who wrote "Hector lives"
in rocks.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.870
He's the one who's trying
to frame Hector.

42:30.340 --> 42:32.717
Who Walt now
suspects is you.

42:33.051 --> 42:33.915
Yes.

42:35.804 --> 42:38.796
And Walt knows
the combination to my safe.

42:39.599 --> 42:42.511
And if he searched my place,
he would find this.

42:44.646 --> 42:47.183
I know that we
have a deal, Mathias,

42:47.399 --> 42:50.732
but Hector needs to lay low
for a while.

42:50.944 --> 42:52.980
And we need to return that
to the wall.

42:54.406 --> 42:55.942
Aren't you forgetting
something?

42:57.409 --> 42:58.444
Probably.

42:58.660 --> 43:00.241
Hector has a bounty
on his head.

43:00.871 --> 43:02.657
Last time I went
to find Hector,

43:02.873 --> 43:04.989
I went looking for him
out at that wall.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.415
What makes you think
some greedy bounty hunter

43:07.627 --> 43:09.037
isn't lurking out there
right now?

43:09.254 --> 43:11.961
Well, like I said,
I cannot keep it any longer.

43:15.927 --> 43:18.543
I think you've lived up
to the terms of our deal.

43:18.722 --> 43:20.303
It's time to move on.

43:20.515 --> 43:21.721
Hector's dead.

43:22.642 --> 43:24.928
-Are you sure?
-For now.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.890
Hector's come back
from the dead before.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.188
Who's to say
he won't come back again?

43:34.780 --> 43:36.862
Get some sleep,
Standing Bear.

43:37.074 --> 43:38.314
You look like shit.

43:39.159 --> 43:40.820
[vehicle door opens, closes]

43:41.036 --> 43:42.992
[engine starts]

43:57.010 --> 43:58.420
Ferg, have you
heard from Vic?

43:59.221 --> 44:00.051
No.

44:06.561 --> 44:08.301
Did you ever find Monte?

44:08.897 --> 44:10.933
Yeah. I got his
address right here.

44:15.529 --> 44:16.735
[sighs]

44:18.031 --> 44:19.612
All right, well, uh...

44:20.700 --> 44:23.942
l have a little project
that I could use a hand with.

44:24.412 --> 44:27.495
-Okay.
-Well, before you say yes,

44:27.707 --> 44:33.543
you should know that it's not,
strictly speaking, uh, legal.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.511
Hey.

44:43.682 --> 44:45.798
Did you, uh, give
the D.A.'s office the gun?

44:46.017 --> 44:48.633
Yeah. So assuming the DNA
and the fingerprints match,

44:48.854 --> 44:49.934
the prosecutor thinks
it should be easy

44:50.147 --> 44:51.762
to get Chance
convicted of murder.

44:51.982 --> 44:54.849
-Cool. Oh, hey.
-Travis, I'm not an invalid.

44:55.861 --> 44:56.600
You're welcome.

44:57.362 --> 44:59.603
Now off to Urgent Care.

44:59.823 --> 45:01.654
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Travis, no.

45:01.867 --> 45:03.732
I feel totally fine.
Just take me back to work.

45:04.244 --> 45:05.780
There's nothing weak
about taking care of yourself,

45:05.996 --> 45:08.783
especially when you're,
you know, with child.

45:08.999 --> 45:11.866
Ew. Just say, like, "preggers"
or "knocked up" or something.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.579
Call it whatever you want.

45:13.795 --> 45:15.751
We're going
to the baby doctor now.

45:16.798 --> 45:18.083
[sighs]

45:24.931 --> 45:26.637
[glass shattering]

45:57.214 --> 46:00.456
[engine idling]

46:05.347 --> 46:08.430
[siren wailing]

46:08.600 --> 46:09.715
[siren chirping]

46:22.072 --> 46:24.984
Sir, I need to see your license
and registration, please.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.656
Ferguson, what's up?

46:27.661 --> 46:29.071
You messing with me?

46:33.541 --> 46:35.406
You just rolled through
that stop sign.

46:35.794 --> 46:39.332
License and registration--
now.

46:39.547 --> 46:41.333
My house is right here.

46:42.008 --> 46:44.294
You know, most accidents
occur a mile from home.

46:47.514 --> 46:48.594
[scoffs]

46:56.147 --> 46:57.478
I get it.
A little payback

46:57.691 --> 46:59.727
for coming down
on the sheriff, right?

46:59.943 --> 47:03.811
Just doing my job...
Montgomery.

47:06.658 --> 47:08.114
Step out of the car,
please.

47:17.794 --> 47:19.910
Man, you'd think by now
you all would realize

47:20.130 --> 47:22.462
that there's consequences
for abusing your power.

47:28.221 --> 47:30.007
Do you seriously think
that I won't file a complaint?

47:30.223 --> 47:31.178
I'll tell you what.

47:32.392 --> 47:33.882
You hold back
on that complaint,

47:34.644 --> 47:35.975
I'll let you off
with just a warning.

47:36.187 --> 47:37.438
[scoffs]

47:37.605 --> 47:39.596
You'd rather have
the moving violation?

47:41.067 --> 47:42.978
I mean,
I'm good either way.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.036
[Dr. Susman] This is gonna feel
a little cold.

47:56.249 --> 47:58.615
[Travis] I keep, uh, telling her
she can't get in fights anymore

47:58.835 --> 48:00.951
now that she's pregnant,
but she won't listen.

48:01.171 --> 48:03.457
That is not true.
You told me after the fact.

48:03.673 --> 48:05.413
And it's not like I went out
looking for a fight, Travis.

48:05.633 --> 48:08.170
-Tell her I'm right, doc.
-|t's never good to fight.

48:08.386 --> 48:10.843
-See? Told you.
-All right, okay.
You need to leave.

48:11.056 --> 48:11.966
-What?
-Because you're annoying

48:12.182 --> 48:13.547
the shit out of me, and aren't I

48:13.725 --> 48:14.680
supposed to be avoiding
unnecessary stress

48:14.893 --> 48:16.349
now that I'm pregnant?

48:16.519 --> 48:17.634
Do the two of you need
a minute to yourselves?

48:17.854 --> 48:19.685
-No. Not really.
-No. No, we're fine.

48:19.898 --> 48:21.980
Um, |'||-- I'll be quiet.
I promise.

48:22.192 --> 48:25.810
Uh, just, you know,
do your thing. [clears throat]

48:27.530 --> 48:28.315
What?

48:32.369 --> 48:34.735
[heart beating]

48:34.954 --> 48:38.082
Oh, my God.
What-- What is that?

48:38.291 --> 48:41.124
-|s that bad?
-No.

48:42.379 --> 48:43.710
It's a heartbeat.

48:43.880 --> 48:45.381
[chuckles]

48:45.590 --> 48:47.455
[sighs]

48:58.770 --> 49:01.603
[door opens]
[Mandy] Dude.

49:01.815 --> 49:03.521
My aunt is so psyched
that you gave me this job

49:03.733 --> 49:05.314
that she wants
to adopt you.

49:05.527 --> 49:07.142
-You know what time it is?
-No.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.526
It's 11:00.

49:09.239 --> 49:11.025
You're supposed to
be here at 9:00.

49:12.117 --> 49:14.449
Cool.
So,youin?

49:14.661 --> 49:16.526
-Am I in for what?
-I told you.

49:16.746 --> 49:19.783
My aunt wants to adopt you,
like, into the tribe.

49:21.167 --> 49:23.749
We're putting together a sweat.
You know -- like a ceremony.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.785
And we're getting a friend
who's a medicine man.

49:25.964 --> 49:27.204
The whole deal.

49:27.715 --> 49:28.750
A sweat?

49:29.134 --> 49:30.169
Mm-hmm.

49:30.635 --> 49:31.795
Wow.

49:32.011 --> 49:33.091
Thafs”.

49:34.472 --> 49:35.712
I'm really touched.

49:39.602 --> 49:41.308
I'm a little surprised,
though.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.470
You have been doing a lot
for this tribe.

49:43.690 --> 49:45.931
No, I'm--
I'm surprised by you.

49:46.151 --> 49:49.609
I-I didn't realize
that you were so spiritually--

49:49.821 --> 49:53.860
No. But sometimes the experience
is better than peyote.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.331
Okay,
this is kind of scary.

50:03.543 --> 50:05.158
It's two signs
of the apocalypse.

50:05.378 --> 50:07.790
You're here, and you're
using a computer.

50:08.381 --> 50:09.370
If you pull out a cellphone,

50:09.591 --> 50:10.751
I think we're gonna get hit
by a meteor.

50:10.967 --> 50:12.252
What's up, Dave?

50:12.469 --> 50:14.630
[sighs]
We need to talk.

50:15.263 --> 50:16.252
Strategy.

50:18.892 --> 50:19.597
Okay.

50:20.602 --> 50:22.058
I'm worried about
our character witnesses.

50:22.270 --> 50:25.603
lfeel like...
we don't have any.

50:25.815 --> 50:27.430
You don't want to put Vic
on the stand?

50:27.650 --> 50:29.515
Even though Chance Gilbert
was convicted,

50:29.736 --> 50:30.896
I worry there will still be

50:31.112 --> 50:33.353
a residual stench
of sex scandal with her.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.031
I see.

50:37.202 --> 50:39.443
But we haven't talked about
people outside your department.

50:39.662 --> 50:42.153
You-- You've been doing this
a while.

50:42.373 --> 50:44.455
How's your relationship
with the mayor?
[chuckles]

50:45.168 --> 50:46.248
It's been better.

50:47.670 --> 50:49.080
Well, then I think
we're just gonna have to go

50:49.297 --> 50:52.630
with focusing
on a truth defense.

50:52.800 --> 50:53.755
You're kidding me.

50:53.968 --> 50:55.879
The truth is plan "B"?

50:56.095 --> 50:57.596
Sadly.

50:57.764 --> 51:02.007
But you have an honest face,
so who knows?

51:02.227 --> 51:07.062
We will work hard to win,
but we have to plan to lose.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.605
So, plan "B" is truth.

51:09.817 --> 51:12.274
Plan "C" is, we lose?

51:13.279 --> 51:14.394
We might.

51:15.114 --> 51:16.069
And there's a lot at stake,

51:16.241 --> 51:19.028
so I want to talk
about protecting your assets.

51:20.078 --> 51:21.363
How do I do that?

51:21.579 --> 51:23.035
Basically hide your money.

51:23.248 --> 51:26.661
Give it to other people,
like your daughter.

51:27.460 --> 51:30.918
This is an accountant
I trust.

51:31.130 --> 51:33.257
Just sit down with him.

51:33.466 --> 51:34.706
He'll help you out.

51:35.468 --> 51:37.333
And that way,
I'll maintain total deniability

51:37.554 --> 51:39.010
in the penalty phase,

51:39.222 --> 51:41.213
you know,
should there be one.

51:50.567 --> 51:54.685
Seriously, Walt, call him.

52:03.204 --> 52:04.034
Walter.

52:05.039 --> 52:07.951
This came for you.
No return address.

52:09.210 --> 52:10.325
-Thanks, Ruby.
-Mm-hmm.

53:01.220 --> 53:04.212
J‘J‘J‘J‘

53:18.613 --> 53:20.023
[door opens]

53:20.239 --> 53:22.230
-Mr. Mayor.
-Hey! Jacob!

53:22.450 --> 53:23.940
-You wanted to see me.
-Come on in.

53:24.160 --> 53:25.445
-Can I get you something?
A water?
-No, I'm good.

53:25.662 --> 53:27.448
ExceHent
Sit down.

53:33.211 --> 53:35.748
You know,
in all my years,

53:35.922 --> 53:38.208
I've never been invited
to the mayor's office.

53:38.883 --> 53:40.384
The sheriff's office
a few times,

53:40.593 --> 53:42.709
but never the mayor.

53:42.929 --> 53:45.136
Well, times have changed.

53:46.432 --> 53:48.718
-Have they?
-They're about to.

53:48.935 --> 53:51.472
-You know I'm up
for re-election soon.
-Mm.

53:51.646 --> 53:54.388
And you're not going
to be unopposed this time,

53:54.607 --> 53:55.687
I understand.

53:55.900 --> 53:58.141
That's why I need your support
now more than ever.

53:58.319 --> 54:01.903
-Me?
-Jacob, your casino
might not be in my town,

54:02.115 --> 54:04.106
but it is not lost on me
the importance

54:04.283 --> 54:06.239
it has on the economy
of this county.

54:06.452 --> 54:08.192
So, what are you offering me?

54:08.413 --> 54:11.496
[chuckles]
You get right to the point.

54:11.708 --> 54:14.450
When dealing with the big chiefs
of the white men,

54:14.669 --> 54:15.784
I've learned it's best

54:15.962 --> 54:18.078
to cut through
the bullshit early,

54:18.297 --> 54:20.253
or you're likely
to drown in it.

54:21.050 --> 54:23.666
-Touché.
-Seriously, Sawyer,

54:23.886 --> 54:26.844
why should I throw
my money, my publicity machine,

54:27.056 --> 54:30.799
and my sizeable off-Res
native constituency your way?

54:31.018 --> 54:34.055
Because I'm going to solve
your biggest problem for you.

54:34.897 --> 54:38.185
Ooh.
That's intriguing.

54:38.776 --> 54:41.358
And what, in your mind,
is my biggest problem?

54:42.113 --> 54:44.104
Sheriff Walt Longmire.

54:45.491 --> 54:47.106
He's been standing in the way
of everything

54:47.326 --> 54:49.863
we've been trying to do in this
county for years.

54:50.079 --> 54:52.411
His squeaky-clean,
aw-shucks image

54:52.623 --> 54:54.614
has made him
impossible to go after.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.871
But that was before
the civil suit.

54:59.964 --> 55:01.704
I can take him down now.

55:08.931 --> 55:12.799
[rock music plays]
Oh, no.

55:13.019 --> 55:14.509
Oh, no.

55:16.981 --> 55:17.936
Are you okay?

55:18.149 --> 55:21.562
No. | just went to the restroom,
and now my coat's gone.

55:21.778 --> 55:23.564
Are you sure? Maybe you were
sitting somewhere else.

55:23.780 --> 55:24.895
No.
My coat was right here,

55:25.114 --> 55:26.695
and the car keys were
in the pocket.

55:26.908 --> 55:28.523
I have to get home.

55:28.743 --> 55:31.029
My baby had an accident.
The sitter just called.

55:31.204 --> 55:32.284
I have to get home.

55:32.497 --> 55:34.078
-What is your name?
-Anne.

55:34.290 --> 55:36.121
Anne, everything is going
to be okay.

55:36.334 --> 55:38.916
But I just tried calling her
back, and she won't answer.

55:39.128 --> 55:41.540
I don't know
if her phone died or what.

55:41.756 --> 55:42.666
Anne...

55:45.259 --> 55:46.374
I will drive you home.

55:46.594 --> 55:47.583
Just tell me the way.

55:47.762 --> 55:48.842
Oh, my God.

55:49.055 --> 55:50.420
Thank you so much.

57:47.757 --> 57:50.794
[Anne] That's it,
but why aren't the lights on?

57:51.010 --> 57:53.046
Something's wrong.
I knew it.

57:53.262 --> 57:55.048
Do you want me to come inside
with you?

57:55.264 --> 57:57.175
Yeah. Okay.

57:57.391 --> 57:58.801
Yeah, thanks.

58:03.773 --> 58:06.560
Oh, my God. Do you think
that they went to the hospital?

58:17.495 --> 58:19.577
Nope. False alarm.

58:19.789 --> 58:21.279
Everything's cool.

58:26.128 --> 58:27.709
[Malachi]
Hello, Hank.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.336
I see you met
my granddaughter.

58:30.466 --> 58:31.751
I'm gonna go watch TV.

58:31.926 --> 58:33.666
I'll be in the back
if you need me, Grandpa.

58:54.156 --> 58:58.195
Cady, your work brings a balance
and an order to this community.

58:58.744 --> 59:01.156
You have spilled blood
to protect a Cheyenne.

59:01.372 --> 59:04.330
Acts and actions speak louder
than your blood origin.

59:05.876 --> 59:07.457
Blood doesn't make family.

59:08.129 --> 59:09.460
Tribe makes family.

59:10.548 --> 59:12.504
From now on, you don't call
each other "friend."

59:13.134 --> 59:14.624
You call each other
"sister."

59:15.845 --> 59:17.927
What belongs to one
belongs to the other.

59:18.139 --> 59:20.551
[drum beating]

59:20.766 --> 59:23.633
[ceremonial chanting]

1:00:07.021 --> 1:00:08.136
Well, hey, there, Walt.

1:00:09.315 --> 1:00:12.478
You want to tell me what you
and me are doing out here

1:00:12.693 --> 1:00:14.524
without your counsel
present?

1:00:15.279 --> 1:00:17.190
It's highly unorthodox.

1:00:17.406 --> 1:00:19.613
Well, him not being here
is kind of the point.

1:00:19.825 --> 1:00:20.940
Mm-hmm.

1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:23.651
I wanted to talk to you
man to man

1:00:24.997 --> 1:00:26.203
about what happened here.

1:00:27.708 --> 1:00:28.993
You mean your version.

1:00:30.169 --> 1:00:32.160
I'm the only one
knows the real version.

1:00:35.007 --> 1:00:37.043
Right, that's because
you're withholding evidence.

1:00:38.177 --> 1:00:40.008
You haven't shared
everything you have with us,

1:00:40.221 --> 1:00:42.837
which is, of course,
totally illegal.

1:00:44.266 --> 1:00:46.097
Now, I hardly think
you're the one

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:48.266
to be lecturing me
on the law.

1:00:48.479 --> 1:00:51.437
-And yet it seems
like I have to.
-Mm.

1:00:51.649 --> 1:00:53.981
If you try and use
that FBI evidence

1:00:54.193 --> 1:00:55.899
that you have
without disclosing it,

1:00:56.737 --> 1:00:59.069
Dave Milgrom
will have it thrown out.

1:00:59.740 --> 1:01:01.025
It doesn't matter, anyway,

1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:02.815
'cause you're misinterpreting
what you have.

1:01:03.744 --> 1:01:04.984
Am I?

1:01:05.162 --> 1:01:06.242
You have testimony

1:01:06.455 --> 1:01:08.446
that the FBI suppressed
phone records,

1:01:08.666 --> 1:01:13.205
specifically a phone call
from my house to Barlow's house

1:01:13.420 --> 1:01:14.500
two hours before I shot him.

1:01:16.257 --> 1:01:17.918
How did you come by
that information?

1:01:18.801 --> 1:01:21.668
-Police work.
-[chuckles]

1:01:21.887 --> 1:01:24.424
But I'm trying to save you
the time and expense

1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:25.846
of taking that
all the way to trial.

1:01:26.058 --> 1:01:28.140
It's not the smoking gun
you think it is.

1:01:28.352 --> 1:01:31.014
I didn't call Barlow
and invite him out here.

1:01:31.230 --> 1:01:32.970
He rode out here
on his own.

1:01:33.190 --> 1:01:34.646
He called his own house,

1:01:34.859 --> 1:01:38.067
and he knowingly pulled
an unloaded gun on me.

1:01:39.947 --> 1:01:42.063
He was trying to frame me
for murder.

1:01:42.241 --> 1:01:44.402
Really, it was just
suicide by cop.

1:01:44.618 --> 1:01:48.531
The phone call
was five seconds, Tucker.

1:01:48.747 --> 1:01:49.907
That's hardly enough time

1:01:50.082 --> 1:01:51.538
for him and l
to make arrangements.

1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:56.042
So, you think this whole thing
was a setup?

1:01:57.131 --> 1:01:59.998
Just Barlow trying to take
one last swipe at you

1:02:00.217 --> 1:02:01.377
from beyond the grave?

1:02:02.178 --> 1:02:02.883
Yep.

1:02:03.721 --> 1:02:05.086
Damn, Walt.

1:02:07.808 --> 1:02:08.968
I believe you.

1:02:11.353 --> 1:02:13.765
Barlow Connally
was a son of a bitch.

1:02:15.733 --> 1:02:21.478
But... that son of a bitch
happened to be my best friend.

1:02:21.697 --> 1:02:24.814
And do you know what he did
the day before he died?

1:02:25.034 --> 1:02:28.071
He had some papers drawn up
making me, Tucker Baggett,

1:02:28.245 --> 1:02:30.827
C.E.O.
of Connally Enterprises

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:33.122
should anything
ever happen to him.

1:02:33.959 --> 1:02:36.211
That is a true friend.

1:02:37.129 --> 1:02:38.209
And now you're standing

1:02:38.422 --> 1:02:40.413
right in the way
of our big plan.

1:02:41.175 --> 1:02:42.415
What plan?

1:02:42.635 --> 1:02:45.627
A world-class golf resort
and residential community

1:02:45.804 --> 1:02:48.887
in the most pristine place
on God's green earth--

1:02:49.099 --> 1:02:49.884
right here!

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:52.011
[laughs]

1:02:54.313 --> 1:02:55.223
Here?

1:02:56.315 --> 1:02:58.806
[laughs]

1:02:59.026 --> 1:03:01.233
That's never gonna happen.

1:03:01.403 --> 1:03:03.735
You get this land
over my dead body.

1:03:03.948 --> 1:03:05.654
[chuckles] Nah.

1:03:05.866 --> 1:03:08.278
I'll get it over cocktails
with a Realtor.

1:03:08.494 --> 1:03:11.611
You see, Wait,
I know how much money you have.

1:03:11.830 --> 1:03:14.742
And if the judge gives me
half of what I'm asking,

1:03:14.959 --> 1:03:17.041
you're gonna have to sell
this whole property

1:03:17.253 --> 1:03:18.834
just to cover the judgment.

1:03:19.713 --> 1:03:21.578
Just think about it, Walt.

1:03:21.799 --> 1:03:24.541
36 holes
of championship golf.

1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:27.342
200 single-family parcels,

1:03:27.554 --> 1:03:30.296
each with over an acre
of their own land.

1:03:30.516 --> 1:03:32.427
And a blue ribbon
trout stream

1:03:32.601 --> 1:03:33.841
running right through
the middle of it.

1:03:34.061 --> 1:03:35.722
Why, hell, Walt,

1:03:36.397 --> 1:03:38.103
it's the stuff
dreams are made of.

1:03:38.315 --> 1:03:39.304
[chuckles]

1:03:40.734 --> 1:03:42.110
Barlow, it's Walt.

1:03:42.319 --> 1:03:44.230
I need to talk with you.
My place.

1:03:49.118 --> 1:03:50.198
Fourseconds.

1:03:54.665 --> 1:03:56.496
Good luck with the truth.

1:04:07.303 --> 1:04:10.841
[vehicle door opens, closes]

1:04:11.056 --> 1:04:13.513
[engine starts]

1:04:22.401 --> 1:04:25.063
Wakey, wakey, Hank.

1:04:26.447 --> 1:04:30.360
Hey, do me a favor
and give these straps a tug.

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:33.108
I'd like to make sure
they're good and tight.

1:04:34.788 --> 1:04:36.073
[breathing heavily]

1:04:36.290 --> 1:04:37.780
Where are we?

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:39.831
This here's
the Crow reservation.

1:04:40.753 --> 1:04:42.163
Got any friends here?

1:04:42.379 --> 1:04:43.755
Huh?

1:04:43.922 --> 1:04:46.004
No, I don't
suppose you do.

1:04:47.051 --> 1:04:48.040
Go to hell.

1:04:48.260 --> 1:04:50.592
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

1:04:51.430 --> 1:04:54.092
You don't get
to send me away, Hank.

1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:59.051
You recognize these stakes?

1:04:59.271 --> 1:05:00.727
They're Nighthorse's.

1:05:01.732 --> 1:05:04.314
Part of a-- a ritual of his

1:05:04.526 --> 1:05:07.063
where he summons up
the Dog Soldiers.

1:05:07.279 --> 1:05:09.065
You know, the old warriors

1:05:09.239 --> 1:05:10.854
used to stake themselves
to the earth

1:05:11.075 --> 1:05:13.908
and stand their ground
to the death.

1:05:14.119 --> 1:05:19.864
Well, Nighthorse--
He's not really a Dog Soldier.

1:05:20.042 --> 1:05:24.081
He's basically
a white man playacting...

1:05:25.339 --> 1:05:27.125
just like you.

1:05:28.133 --> 1:05:32.376
So I'm gonna give you a chance
to experience the real thing--

1:05:33.263 --> 1:05:35.845
to stand your ground
till death.

1:05:36.058 --> 1:05:41.644
-[spits]
-Uaughs]

1:05:41.855 --> 1:05:45.473
Oh, a couple hours
of this sun beating down on you,

1:05:45.692 --> 1:05:48.525
and you're gonna wish
you had this spit back.
