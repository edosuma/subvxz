In this land of ours,
there are many great pits,

but none more bottomless
than the Bottomless Pit,

00:11.345 --> 00:13.393
which as you can see here,
is bottomless.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.976

Grunkle Stan, do I really have to be
the one to point out

00:54.805 --> 00:57.684
that a bottomless pit is,
by definition, impossible?

20:28.686 --> 20:29.858
What? Author?

20:30.062 --> 20:33.657
(CHUCKLING) Writers!
Masters of fiction. Goodnight, Officers!

20:33.899 --> 20:34.821
(SIGHS)

20:35.025 --> 20:36.277
Hey, you all right?

20:36.444 --> 20:37.946
I can't believe I lied.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.532
Mabel, it was for the greater good.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.458
Yeah. The greater good.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.126
STAN: Hello, police station?

20:44.535 --> 20:49.086
Yeah, I forgot to tell 'em
about my tax fraud. No, tax fraud.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.422
- DIPPER: Get 'em out!
- What's gotten into you kids?

20:53.169 --> 20:55.718
We have to find a place
to get rid of these.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.136
(GRUNTING)

20:59.884 --> 21:03.184
And I never saw that box
full of magical teeth again.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.014
Oh, wait! There it is.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.062
(ALL GROAN)

21:07.808 --> 21:09.025
Oh, sweet! My shoes!

21:09.894 --> 21:12.647
I liked the part with the bear.
The rest seemed pretty far-fetched.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.983
Mabel, we already know that story.
We just lived through it.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.034
So if we're living through
that story right now,

21:17.234 --> 21:18.281
then how does it end?

21:18.486 --> 21:20.079
Guys, do you see that?

21:23.073 --> 21:23.995
Oh, what is that?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.793
- Oh, no!
- Where are we going?

21:25.993 --> 21:28.462
- That doesn't look good.
-(ALL SCREAMING)

21:31.248 --> 21:32.340
(BLEATING)

21:32.541 --> 21:33.918
(SCREAMING)

21:34.376 --> 21:36.504
(GROANING) Where are we?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.760
(GASPING) Look! The Shack!

21:38.923 --> 21:43.019
Which means we came
right back out the top!

21:44.094 --> 21:45.767
And I don't think any time has passed.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.939
It must be some kind of worm-hole.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.393
Yeah, dude, that sounds
sciency enough to be true.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.438
(STAMMERS) But that's impossible!
No one will believe us!

21:53.646 --> 21:56.900
Maybe this is one story
we should keep to ourselves.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.279
ALL: Agreed.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.237
-(wool> CREAKING)
-(STAN SCREAMING)

22:02.488 --> 22:03.455
He'll be fine.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.595
(SIGHS)

22:31.016 --> 22:32.017
This is stupid.
