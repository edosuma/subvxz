All right, I got all
the names of the firefighters

36:48.510 --> 36:50.120
who went into the Reserve.

36:50.164 --> 36:51.731
Fire captain
swore them to secrecy.

36:51.774 --> 36:52.993
Nobody saw anything.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.212
Now we know
what the president

36:54.255 --> 36:56.214
was doing with that clay mine.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.477
This has to be kept quiet.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.348
How long's
it gonna stay that way?

37:00.392 --> 37:02.307
Biggest bank heist in history?

37:02.350 --> 37:03.699
And where the hell
is all that gold?

37:03.743 --> 37:06.528
Anywhere, but we are now
part of a very select

37:06.572 --> 37:09.401
group of people who suspects
who really took it.

37:09.444 --> 37:12.795
Can't prove it, though, because
he used Swanstrom's name.

37:12.839 --> 37:15.102
Elena was right again.

37:15.145 --> 37:19.019
Val, knowing what we know,
are we...

37:19.062 --> 37:20.977
In danger?

37:21.021 --> 37:25.634
For now, we tell no one what
we know about the president.

37:25.678 --> 37:29.247
Even if we did,
who would believe us?

37:29.290 --> 37:31.074
We'd sound as crazy
as the Serial Skeptic.

37:31.118 --> 37:33.251
Agent Turner.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.600
Speak of the devil.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.950
Elena do this?

37:36.993 --> 37:38.081
What was it this time?

37:38.125 --> 37:40.345
Nothing.
False alarm.

No, come on.
I'll call it an anonymous tip.

I'm not sure you have

- Located.
