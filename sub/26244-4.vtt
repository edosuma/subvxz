tend to sweat when I'm nervous,

14:45.843 --> 14:46.969
Hilda?

-What the...?
-[herd mooing]

15:02.526 --> 15:05.321
Yeehaw! Ha ha!

15:06.363 --> 15:08.282
[vittra grunting] Ha ha!

15:08.365 --> 15:10.910
Nyah, nyah! [laughing]

15:16.790 --> 15:17.833
[door slams]

15:24.214 --> 15:25.633
Whoops.

Oh!

15:42.858 --> 15:44.652
[both groan]

15:46.153 --> 15:48.280
Look, we could do this forever.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.908
Or we could cut a deal.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.910
-I'm listening.
-[sighs]

15:58.290 --> 15:59.375
[sipping]

16:00.334 --> 16:07.091
I'll help you find that irritating girl
if you return my friends. Huh?

16:09.760 --> 16:13.472
Deal, but we'll have to hurry.
Your friends are scheduled for mulching.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.225
[coughing] Mulching?!

16:16.308 --> 16:18.894
-Hey, mister.
-Shut up, little kid!

16:18.978 --> 16:21.647
-I found something weird.
-Okay.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.567
[Frida grunting]

16:26.402 --> 16:27.236
Frida!

16:28.070 --> 16:29.863
[Frida grunting]

16:29.947 --> 16:31.907
[both grunt]

16:32.408 --> 16:33.951
You really wedged yourself in.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.079
Well, that's what you get
for using an old rabbit hole

16:37.162 --> 16:39.707
instead of a proper vittra tunnel.

16:40.290 --> 16:43.043
[Frida] It's not always easy
to tell the difference.

16:43.127 --> 16:46.171
Well, then I guess you're not
as smart as you think you are.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.173
[Frida gasps] You're very rude!

16:48.257 --> 16:51.719
And you have all the charm
of a rock-chewing slug!

16:53.762 --> 16:55.014
[burps]

16:55.097 --> 16:56.348
That's enough!

16:57.016 --> 16:59.059
[both grunting]

17:00.644 --> 17:02.187
[panting]

17:02.271 --> 17:04.189
I could use a hand, you know.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.607
[all grunting]

17:05.691 --> 17:09.528
Come on. And pull!

17:09.611 --> 17:11.071

17:11.155 --> 17:12.114
Ooh!

17:12.197 --> 17:13.282
[pants, gasps]

17:13.365 --> 17:14.992
You have no right to wear that!

17:15.075 --> 17:18.787
Oh, I'll wear it
until I get my friends back!

17:18.871 --> 17:22.041
-What?
-Come on, guys, we have to hurry!

17:22.833 --> 17:23.876
Bye, mister.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.672
-[Hilda] David!
-[Twig grunts, growling]

17:28.756 --> 17:31.383
[David grunting]

17:32.051 --> 17:34.511
[girls panting]

17:34.595 --> 17:35.888
Hey, boy!

17:35.971 --> 17:38.348
I can't believe you found her.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.350
He helped me.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.103
Hey, we made a deal!

17:43.187 --> 17:46.607
[sighs] And now we're going to fail
the badge challenge, thanks to your deal.

17:46.690 --> 17:51.945
Yeah, but it kind of saved you
from being stuck underground forever.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.573
O-- Okay, that's a fair point.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.366
[exhales]

17:56.909 --> 17:59.328
Thank you for coming after me.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.788
That was really brave.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.916
It's just this wasn't
part of my action plan.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.169
-So I freaked a little.
-[vittra] Or a lot!

18:08.045 --> 18:12.966
-So, what's your action plan?
-It's pretty simple, really.

18:13.509 --> 18:17.554
Save the vittra from the Big Chipper,
come back here, stick 'em in the ground.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.390
-All by yourself?
-Sure.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.142
-No.
-No?

18:22.226 --> 18:23.769
Not all by yourself.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.855
-David and I are coming with you.
-We are?

18:26.939 --> 18:28.649
And I'm coming, too.

18:28.732 --> 18:29.817
[whistles]

18:29.900 --> 18:31.568
[mooing]

18:31.652 --> 18:33.070
That's the spirit! [laughs]

18:33.153 --> 18:36.573
-See? We're all in this together.
-Ugh! Not really.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.243
I'm in it to make sure
you lot don't mess it up.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.411
-Giddyup! Hyah!
-[moos]

18:42.746 --> 18:44.498
Let's just go.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.047
Oh, we're too late!

18:52.131 --> 18:53.841
It's closed for the night.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.051
Maybe we could come back tomorrow.

18:56.135 --> 18:56.969
Look!

19:00.305 --> 19:03.684
[all snoring]

19:04.268 --> 19:07.813
-It's now or never.
-She's right. Come on, David.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.064
[both grunting]

19:09.148 --> 19:11.525
I'm not a fan of heights.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.820
[sighs] Sometimes under
is better than over, you know.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.822
-[bellows]
-Heeyah!

19:16.905 --> 19:17.781
Careful!

19:18.949 --> 19:20.909
[both grunting, panting]

19:20.993 --> 19:21.827
Come on!

19:25.622 --> 19:27.040
[vittra shouting]

19:27.124 --> 19:28.041
Ha!

19:32.004 --> 19:33.672
[panting]

19:34.381 --> 19:35.716
Frida, catch!

19:35.799 --> 19:37.467
[gasps, grunting]

19:39.469 --> 19:41.638
[music playing on TV]

19:44.224 --> 19:46.727
Ooh, at the top!
Georgie-boy!

19:46.810 --> 19:48.395
He's the last one.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.695
[panting]

19:58.363 --> 19:59.239
Got you!

19:59.323 --> 20:00.949
Whoa!

20:02.701 --> 20:04.745
-Hilda!
-Georgie-boy!

20:04.828 --> 20:06.079
I can't look.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.165
Yes, you can! Push!

20:08.790 --> 20:12.044
[music playing on TV]

20:12.127 --> 20:13.462
[grunting]

20:15.088 --> 20:17.633
It's okay, Hilda!
We've got you!

20:18.217 --> 20:22.179
Then we're coming down!

20:22.262 --> 20:23.305
[grunts]

20:23.388 --> 20:25.307
Hilda, are you okay?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.310
Whoa!

20:28.393 --> 20:32.022
[chuckles] A traumatic fall for sure,
but I'm fine.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.234
[chuckles] That has to be worth
at least a hundred points

20:35.317 --> 20:37.194
for the Catch Your Falling Friend badge.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.403
Really?

20:39.029 --> 20:41.073
No. There's no badge for that.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.991
Well, there should be.

20:53.710 --> 20:57.547
I can't believe your friends
slept through all of this.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.343
Ha! There's not much
that can wake a hibernating vittra...

21:01.426 --> 21:03.845
except pounding a stake in its head.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.973
[chuckles] Yeah, sorry about that.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.725
You have to admit, above-grounders
aren't as bad as you thought.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.311
You pulled up my friends
in the first place,

21:11.395 --> 21:14.439
so don't expect a prize
just for bringing them back!

21:15.565 --> 21:16.400
[sighs]

21:17.776 --> 21:19.569
But a deal's a deal.

21:21.822 --> 21:22.656
Here.

[Frida] <i>David, Hilda, and I</i>
