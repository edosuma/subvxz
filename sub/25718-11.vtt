WEBVTT

00:46.463 --> 00:47.422
Do you...

00:48.715 --> 00:50.383
have a crush on him too?

00:54.137 --> 00:55.555
No way. Do you?

00:56.973 --> 01:00.518
<i>What's the problem?</i>
<i>Am I not allowed to like him or what?</i>

01:02.812 --> 01:05.607
You won't need my help.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.068
You're bright,

01:08.151 --> 01:10.028
active, and pretty.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.112
You're pretty too.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.281
What?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.116
You guys going out?

01:15.200 --> 01:17.035
Why do you think so?

01:17.619 --> 01:21.331
You're popular among guys as well
because you're pretty.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.586
I think...

01:27.754 --> 01:30.256
it's a blessing to be pretty,
don't you think?

01:31.174 --> 01:32.675
People naturally like you.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.012
That must be
why those who aren't blessed

01:36.096 --> 01:39.682
get plastic surgery
to enjoy that kind of benefit.

01:41.851 --> 01:44.104
It eventually harms the ones
who were born pretty.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.648
Harm?

01:47.899 --> 01:52.987
I mean, pretty faces become less rare
because of plastic surgery.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.249
I thought that I was mistaken...

02:06.459 --> 02:09.838
and that I was at fault for judging you
in a bad way.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.215
But I wasn't mistaken.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.929
You've hated me...

02:19.222 --> 02:20.390
from the beginning.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.195
Don't get me wrong.

02:35.446 --> 02:39.367
There are just so many pretty girls
these days.That was my point.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.453
I'm sorry if I offended you.

02:44.330 --> 02:48.418
I'm well aware that you had to get
plastic surgery out of despair.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.173
I really wasn't talking about you.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.051
<i>That's a lie.</i>

02:58.928 --> 03:00.388
<i>In any case, what you mean is</i>

03:01.014 --> 03:03.474
<i>that you don't like girls</i>
<i>who got plastic surgery.</i>

03:08.438 --> 03:09.731
That's ridiculous.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.608
She wasn't talking about you?

03:12.650 --> 03:15.987
She can hate me. What bothers me is
how she thinks that I'm dumb.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.616
I told you that girl is weird.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.117
Park Yong-cheol too.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.536
She definitely has it out for you.

03:24.495 --> 03:25.872
Hey, you won't be helping her

03:25.955 --> 03:28.458
so that she can date Kyung-seok, right?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.961
No, I'm not. I told her I won't help her.

03:34.505 --> 03:35.632
What should I do?

03:36.299 --> 03:38.384
Chan-woo found out
that we're going out.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.385
What?

03:40.428 --> 03:42.055
-How did that happen?
-What?

03:42.430 --> 03:43.306
Seeing someone?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.350
Actually...

03:48.853 --> 03:51.314
-Hello.
-Hi, Mi-rae.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.070
So who's the guy you're seeing?

03:57.153 --> 03:58.780
Hey, why are you so slow-witted?

03:58.863 --> 03:59.948
What's wrong?

04:02.909 --> 04:04.744
Why Kim Chan-woo of all people?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.330
This smell.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.291
I can smell Tae-young's girlfriend
somewhere in this room.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.709
It's not funny.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.003
Tae-hee, is it true?

04:14.087 --> 04:17.464
Were you really doing this with Tae-young?

04:18.757 --> 04:21.261
Come on.
Are you in an improper relationship?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.972
Why hide it?
Everyone will congratulate you guys.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.098
Look at us now.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.683
Is this how you congratulate?

04:29.894 --> 04:31.688
I guess that's Tae-young's type.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.691
Because he's skinny,
he want a girlfriend who's like...

04:34.774 --> 04:35.692
Stop it.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.571
-What did you just say?
-What did I say?

04:41.072 --> 04:42.740
Didn't you hear about the festival?

04:43.324 --> 04:45.660
We won't let it slide
if you mock someone's looks ever again.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.662
I didn't say anything.
What did I say?

04:47.745 --> 04:50.039
-Well, I'm not sure.
-We heard it.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.749
I could hear it from here.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.128
Your hearing is too good.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.048
I'll keep my voice down.
Let's talk quietly.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.259
That scumbag deserves no respect.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.261
What?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.430
-Hey.
-What?

05:05.513 --> 05:07.140
How dare you, to a senior?

05:12.520 --> 05:13.980
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.151
Apologize to her.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.157
Hey, come on.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.326
What did you say?

05:26.409 --> 05:31.205
You should apologize for offending juniors
instead of being obscure about it.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.849
<i>If I tell people that I like someone,</i>

05:51.726 --> 05:53.811
<i>and if that someone was Kyung-seok...</i>

05:55.188 --> 05:56.022
No.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.566
They'll definitely make fun of me.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.032
You must've been hungry.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.326
I'll give you more next time.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.670
JANG WON-HO

06:29.097 --> 06:30.431
Sua.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.308
I'm sorry...

06:33.559 --> 06:35.895
about the report and your photo.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.355
No, it's okay.

06:37.688 --> 06:41.317
I felt bad about having reacted
so sensitively toward you.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.113
-I'm sorry too.
-You're so nice.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.324
You're nicer for apologizing to me
about something like that.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.867
The weather's nice today.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.369
I brought my camera.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.330
-Do you want me to take a photo of you?
-Sure.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.293
Please call me right away
If you see her.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.586
Okay, sir.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.171
Have a good day.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.930
JUNG YOUNG-MO

07:13.224 --> 07:15.268
You look just like Kyung-seok.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.522
Hey, don't you feel sad
about wearing the exact same outfit?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.942
This is too expensive for me
to feel that way.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.781
And, why is that important?
What matters is that Sua's no longer mad.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.125
Hey, Won-ho.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.086
Yes?

07:43.129 --> 07:46.466
-Where did you get that shirt?
-Where do you think? I bought it.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.810
Is that a fake?

08:06.068 --> 08:07.111
It's the real deal.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.988
It's from the 2018 S/S collection.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.659
I'll send it to you
as soon as you wire me the money.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.328
Okay.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.014
INCOMING CALL
KYUNG-SEOK

08:39.434 --> 08:40.269
Hello?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.729
Did you sell my clothes?

08:41.812 --> 08:43.813
Yes, I needed some money.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.316
But how did you find out?

08:45.399 --> 08:47.860
Money? Is there something going on?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.119
That was quite impressive.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.540
Why didn't you behave that way before?

09:04.293 --> 09:05.711
Thank you earlier.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.047
I know I'm always mean to you.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.466
No, it's because
Chan-woo crossed the line.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.053
I mistreated you a lot, right?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.097
-No.
-Don't lie.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.348
You never did.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.935
-I always criticize and ignore you.
-I can already think of so many things.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.188
Just eat your food.

09:38.619 --> 09:39.453
Ye-na.

09:39.829 --> 09:40.663
Yes?

09:42.873 --> 09:44.375
You know I like you, right?

09:52.842 --> 09:55.469
It would've been nice
if I told you a bit earlier.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.182
I'm joining the army.

10:01.100 --> 10:01.976
What?

10:05.229 --> 10:07.607
-When?
-As soon as we're done with the finals.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.485
Hey.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.572
I wanted to tell you

10:16.073 --> 10:19.201
how I felt before I actually left.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.371
I...

10:24.373 --> 10:25.541
liked you...

10:26.584 --> 10:27.793
a lot.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.925
Hey.

10:35.009 --> 10:35.843
What?

10:37.428 --> 10:39.555
Why are you telling me that now?

10:40.806 --> 10:43.225
Why are you reacting this way?

10:43.309 --> 10:44.852
My gosh.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.150
-This is so annoying.
-Hey.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.278
Ye-na, what... What's wrong?

10:54.362 --> 10:56.739
That's what I should ask.
What's wrong with you?

10:56.822 --> 10:58.783
Why is she crying
over a guy like him?

10:59.283 --> 11:00.660
He must be really rich.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.579
Okay, don't cry.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.499
What's wrong?

11:06.582 --> 11:08.584
<i>When people refer to a beautiful couple,</i>

11:09.210 --> 11:11.754
<i>which means "like attracts like"...</i>

11:13.172 --> 11:14.590
<i>Kyung-seok is handsome.</i>

11:15.800 --> 11:17.426
<i>But I'm not pretty.</i>

11:19.804 --> 11:21.222
<i>We don't look good together.</i>

11:30.648 --> 11:31.482
Did you eat?

11:32.316 --> 11:33.317
Yes.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.908
<i>Sua looks much better with Kyung-seok</i>
<i>than me.</i>

11:48.958 --> 11:51.585
Kyung-seok takes this class.
Why isn't he coming?

12:28.539 --> 12:29.749
Kyung-seok, is that you?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.209
Yes.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.254
How could you?

12:35.337 --> 12:36.505
What?

12:42.887 --> 12:45.514
-Pack your things.
-Why? You moved out as well.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.849
I said, pack your things.

12:52.563 --> 12:56.525
It'll take some time to do a joint program
with your school and provide internships.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.195
Meanwhile, we suggested to Professor Park

12:59.278 --> 13:02.072
that we could pick a few students
who are interested

13:02.156 --> 13:04.909
and let them take a tour
around our laboratory.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.368
That'd be great.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.662
It's good for students
to experience things.

13:09.413 --> 13:12.500
They won't be able to learn much
in a short period of time,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.960
but it's always better to see things
in person.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.302
-I'm not going to go home.
-Go.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.345
-No.
-I said, go.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.806
No, I'm never going to go home.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.725
-Are you going to live there forever?
-Of course not. Am I dumb?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.227
Then why did you move out?

13:32.728 --> 13:35.523
You're so mean and selfish.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.317
You left home as soon as you found out,
so why can't I?

13:38.776 --> 13:41.070
Do I need to stay home
because I'm younger?

13:41.153 --> 13:43.697
Why didn't you tell me anything?

13:44.198 --> 13:45.157
I hate all of you.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.285
I hate Dad, I hate you,

13:49.620 --> 13:50.746
I hate that woman,

13:51.956 --> 13:53.123
and I also hate myself.

13:53.791 --> 13:54.708
I hate everyone.

13:56.293 --> 13:57.711
What am I supposed to do now?

14:05.010 --> 14:06.971
I'm the only one who didn't know anything.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.974
I said so many mean things to her.

14:12.977 --> 14:13.894
Let's go.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.774
I said, I'm not going to go.
I don't want to see Dad.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.568
I'm not taking you there.

14:21.986 --> 14:22.987
Then where?

14:25.281 --> 14:28.742
She'll probably cry out of happiness
if I tell her that you're coming.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.292
I'm sorry that we can't accept
that many students.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.334
No, it's okay.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.336
Some applied for other activities,

14:39.420 --> 14:42.089
and some are going abroad,
so there won't be a lot.

14:42.172 --> 14:43.966
Ms. Na, wait. Ms. Na.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.263
I guess it's nothing bad.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.473
How do you know that?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.601
No one runs like that if it's bad news.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.519
It's normally the excitement.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.689
-Let's go.
-Okay.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.443
A dinner meeting with Ms. Yoon
of Korea Cosmetics...

15:02.526 --> 15:03.527
Cancel it.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.196
-What about Director Shin...
-Cancel it.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.616
-Then...
-Just cancel everything.

15:09.199 --> 15:12.119
No, I mean, where should I drive you?

15:12.202 --> 15:13.329
To my house.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.331
To your house?

15:38.270 --> 15:39.563
I'll just go.

15:40.522 --> 15:41.732
Why are you so stubborn?

15:41.815 --> 15:43.651
This isn't right. It's too late--

15:43.734 --> 15:45.653
It's not late at all.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.573
We can make things work from now on.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.744
-She might hate me.
-Why would she?

15:56.163 --> 15:57.998
I don't know. She might hate me.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.833
Do you know what I said to her?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.336
-I--
-Why would I hate you?

16:30.155 --> 16:32.825
Thank you for coming.

17:00.978 --> 17:01.979
Excuse me.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.315
Do you know a freshman named Do Kyung-hee?

17:09.278 --> 17:10.654
What's wrong?

17:10.738 --> 17:13.574
Help, there's a pervert here.

17:13.656 --> 17:14.950
-Help.
-What, me?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.247
Stop right there.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.759
Where did he go?

17:44.980 --> 17:45.814
Hello?

17:47.691 --> 17:48.609
Oh, yes.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.446
Thank you so much.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.747
Here.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.299
You can stay here.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.551
Tell me if you need anything.

18:16.887 --> 18:17.805
You must be tired.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.932
Do you want to wash up?

18:20.641 --> 18:21.892
Yes.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.709
<i>Actually, I like Kyung-seok.</i>

18:49.419 --> 18:50.587
<i>Can you help me out?</i>

19:04.935 --> 19:05.769
You look dazed.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.064
I'm not.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.157
<i>What are you doing?</i>

19:18.240 --> 19:19.241
WOO-YOUNG

19:19.366 --> 19:20.242
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:20.325 --> 19:21.201
<i>Nothing much.</i>

19:21.451 --> 19:22.995
OH HYUN-JUNG

19:23.078 --> 19:24.163
<i>How about we gather up today?</i>

19:24.246 --> 19:25.581
HOW ABOUT WE GATHER UP?

19:25.706 --> 19:26.540
<i>I'm in.</i>

19:26.790 --> 19:28.750
OH HYUN-JUNG

19:28.834 --> 19:30.085
<i>How about Mi-rae and Kyung-seok?</i>

19:30.169 --> 19:32.462
HOW ABOUT MI-RAE AND KYUNG-SEOK?

19:42.890 --> 19:45.475
From its interior design
to every single prop...

19:45.976 --> 19:47.060
GROUP CHAT

19:47.144 --> 19:48.687
...I feel so heartbroken.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.901
Kyung-seok, are you listening?

19:54.401 --> 19:56.695
-No.
-Cold-hearted punk.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.990
Right, you wouldn't know how I feel.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.367
I decorated each and every thing
at the bar,

20:02.451 --> 20:05.996
and I have to say goodbye to it,
but you wouldn't know how that feels.

20:06.079 --> 20:08.749
So why did you call me
instead of someone who'd understand?

20:10.209 --> 20:14.796
Try to feel pity on me for having
no one else but you to have a drink with.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.098
What are you going to do?

20:26.975 --> 20:28.185
I don't know.

20:28.769 --> 20:32.773
<i>Choose one: fried chicken and beer,</i>
<i>movie, a karaoke, or indoor baseball?</i>

20:32.856 --> 20:33.815
<i>Indoor baseball?</i>

20:34.233 --> 20:36.401
<i>Sounds good.</i>
<i>I'll be able to blow off steam.</i>

20:37.361 --> 20:39.738
<i>-How about we do it then?</i>
<i>-Deal.</i>

20:39.947 --> 20:42.032
<i>We'll go near your house right now.</i>

20:42.115 --> 20:44.201
WE'LL GO NEAR YOUR HOUSE RIGHT NOW!

20:44.660 --> 20:46.078
Let's go, Mi-rae.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.586
What are you doing? Get ready.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.848
Even my mom can't go against
my dad's will.

21:06.932 --> 21:10.602
He says he'll get divorced
if she gives me money.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.271
Then work part-time.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.856
Should I work here?

21:16.984 --> 21:19.319
You should move in sooner or later.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.530
Or get some financial help.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.908
You can't earn your tuition
only by working part-time.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.453
If I can't, I should take a break.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.164
It's good to be realistic,

21:31.915 --> 21:34.501
but you should give her a chance
to be your mother.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.010
And be good to Mi-rae.

21:44.594 --> 21:45.804
Why are you bringing her up here?

21:45.887 --> 21:49.266
If it hadn't been for her, you would not
have been able to meet her.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.482
Hold on.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.654
What was that smile just now?

22:03.363 --> 22:04.239
What do you mean?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.658
I'm sure there's something.

22:07.242 --> 22:10.162
You know, I'm quick-witted.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.914
In that sense, let me go to the toilet.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.377
Gosh.

22:18.837 --> 22:19.921
Hello.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.259
Hello.

22:27.637 --> 22:28.889
Indoor baseball?

22:38.398 --> 22:40.817
Let's see. It's Hyun Jung's.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.028
It's Mi-rae's.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.697
Isn't this for elementary school students?

22:49.701 --> 22:52.412
Just hold wherever feels comfortable.

22:52.996 --> 22:57.709
Instead of trying to swing it hard, just
try to hit the ball when it approaches.

22:58.418 --> 22:59.503
Stand in position.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.256
Hold the bat.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.300
Then swing.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.137
DO KYUNG-SEOK

23:09.221 --> 23:10.180
You're good.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.773
Finish it up. Let's go out.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.108
Why?

23:21.858 --> 23:23.276
I have somewhere to be.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.073
You want to go home
when your friend is lost in grief?

23:28.156 --> 23:29.074
Yes.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.661
You'll abandon me here and leave?

23:32.744 --> 23:33.954
Finish your drink.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.583
It's Jung-boon.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.298
What are you doing here?

23:46.133 --> 23:47.134
I feel bad.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.345
There are a lot of people who care for me.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.306
Are you consoling him?

23:53.974 --> 23:56.893
I'll leave him to you.
I only have this. Bye.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.771
No, you don't have to leave us alone.
Kyung-seok.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.523
Kyung-seok.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.485
Were you smooching off
of your younger friend?

24:07.154 --> 24:09.948
-Jung-boon.
-Wait a second.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.033
Who's that?

24:12.117 --> 24:13.827
-It's my boyfriend.
-What?

24:13.910 --> 24:16.788
I mean, my male friend.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.248
Oh, okay.

24:18.748 --> 24:21.710
Why? Who are you to get surprised by that?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.628
When did I do that?

24:37.601 --> 24:39.352
Woo-young is very good at this.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.104
I'm no match for him.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.189
Totally.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.941
Hey, isn't it nice to be out?

24:45.358 --> 24:47.569
Isn't it? Aren't you happy?

24:47.777 --> 24:50.530
Alright, it's your turn now.
Go and do a good job.

24:50.655 --> 24:51.656
Okay.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.117
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.417
What do you think? Aren't I pretty good?

25:03.293 --> 25:05.003
I didn't know you could show off.

25:05.712 --> 25:08.089
Gosh, is this fair?
Shall I only use one arm?

25:08.173 --> 25:09.883
You never know though.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.323
Hello.

25:53.468 --> 25:56.179
Excuse me.
Are you a celebrity by any chance?

25:56.263 --> 25:57.430
No, I'm not.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.766
And you're this handsome?

25:59.975 --> 26:01.518
Oh, my goodness.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.604
Wait. Just a second, please.

26:05.146 --> 26:08.525
I'm the owner of Charbain Beaute, Jeno.

26:09.150 --> 26:09.985
Visit my salon.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.905
If you model for us, I'll give you
a free haircut with 200,000 won.

26:14.531 --> 26:15.490
Here.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.785
Here's the address and my number.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.538
Could I get your number by any chance?

26:22.539 --> 26:23.415
No.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.459
Oh, wait!
I'll pay you 250,000 won, then.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.588
How about 300,000 won?

26:30.839 --> 26:32.048
Hey!

26:46.605 --> 26:48.690
My gosh, Mi-rae has great posture.

26:52.736 --> 26:53.945
This is too fast.

26:54.654 --> 26:57.407
You can do it, Mi-rae.
Go for it! You got this.

26:57.490 --> 26:58.325
Go for it.

27:11.087 --> 27:13.340
What just happened? Did you see that?

27:15.258 --> 27:17.636
What's going on here?
I might win at this rate.

27:23.183 --> 27:26.811
INDOOR BATTING CAGE

27:29.481 --> 27:31.483
-Great. Nicely done.
-What is happening?

27:31.566 --> 27:34.235
I've caught up with you. It's a tie!

27:34.319 --> 27:35.779
She's never done this before?

27:35.862 --> 27:38.198
I told you that she's very athletic.

27:50.168 --> 27:52.253
-My gosh, how can she be so good?
-Oh, my.

27:52.545 --> 27:53.838
Amazing.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.132
My goodness.

27:56.716 --> 27:59.302
-I'm so impressed.
-I won!

28:10.313 --> 28:11.731
Hey, we couldn't get a hold of you.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.235
-How did you know?
-You said you were coming here.

28:15.318 --> 28:16.820
Oh, I'm glad you came.

28:16.903 --> 28:20.448
How about we split up into two teams?
The team that loses has to pay for this.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.533
Sure.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.284
You're good at baseball?

28:23.368 --> 28:25.370
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't good.

28:38.508 --> 28:39.592
Why didn't you answer my call?

28:43.054 --> 28:44.681
I didn't know you called.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.728
Good luck!

29:52.665 --> 29:53.541
He's good.

30:05.845 --> 30:08.556
Gosh, how can he hit two home runs
right off the bat?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.183
He's really good.

30:10.266 --> 30:13.019
Let's play one more time.
Shall we do it together?

30:19.108 --> 30:19.943
How much is it?

30:20.026 --> 30:21.361
-It's 56,000 won.
-Okay.

30:21.444 --> 30:22.737
-We'll pay.
-No, it's OK.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.114
I was going to pay.
<i>I</i> asked you to meet up.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.283
But still... Then let's split it.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.160
No, it's really okay.

30:30.787 --> 30:31.913
I'll pay with this.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.166
You're frugal, but you can be generous.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.544
Thank you. We had a great time.

30:37.752 --> 30:38.711
You're welcome.

30:42.298 --> 30:43.633
-Discard the receipt.
-Yes.

30:43.716 --> 30:44.634
-Let's go.
-Thanks.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.094
Goodbye.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.720
-Bye.
-Bye.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.061
Kyung-seok, is there anything
you can't do?

30:55.603 --> 30:58.273
Being so perfect could be impersonal.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.232
Aren't I right?

31:00.400 --> 31:01.234
Yes, that's right.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.156
I'm sure he has at least one shortcoming.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.534
Hey, are you good at soccer too?

31:10.660 --> 31:12.662
He obviously is.
See? he's not answering.

31:13.496 --> 31:14.622
No, not really.

31:19.752 --> 31:22.881
Mi-rae, why are you quiet?
Did all the batting tire you out?

31:24.549 --> 31:26.926
Oh, she's actually quite competitive.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.012
She's probably upset
because she lost.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.348
Is she right?

31:37.270 --> 31:40.189
You played it too seriously.
She was so stoked earlier.

31:43.109 --> 31:43.943
Mi-rae.

31:44.986 --> 31:45.987
Are you really upset

31:47.113 --> 31:48.281
because I beat you?

31:50.491 --> 31:53.870
Yes, I was having so much fun.
What is this now?

31:56.164 --> 31:57.415
Mi-rae, Mi-rae...

32:00.710 --> 32:03.046
Gosh, she's just fooling you guys.

32:03.129 --> 32:05.131
You couldn't tell
because it was so real.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.925
Woo-young, I'll be off, then.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.092
I'll see you later.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.594
Mi-rae, wait up.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.600
She must be really upset.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.728
Did you do something to upset her?

32:23.566 --> 32:26.653
You experienced being broke
and getting dumped by a girl.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.614
Everyone goes through that.
That's how you really grow up.

32:29.697 --> 32:33.618
You're all grown up now.
You can live on your own now.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.928
You said Kyung-seok isn't your type.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.097
Yes, what about it?

32:56.808 --> 32:57.934
I should wash these.

32:58.101 --> 33:00.103
Why are you doing that
to Kyung-seok?

33:01.104 --> 33:02.230
What did I do?

33:03.189 --> 33:05.942
Like you said, I was just annoyed
because he beat me.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.487
I'm not an idiot.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.325
You have feelings for Kyung-seok,
don't you?

33:19.622 --> 33:20.456
Hey.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.086
Be honest, will you?

33:35.930 --> 33:37.056
You see,

33:38.016 --> 33:39.892
I hate being talked about.

33:40.518 --> 33:41.436
I hate it so much.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.690
Because it's never been about
anything good.

33:48.109 --> 33:51.821
"A plastic surgery monster
has a crush on that handsome guy."

33:53.072 --> 33:55.199
I can't put up with all the gossiping.

33:56.909 --> 33:58.536
I just want to live a quiet life.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.344
Kyung-hee moved into my mom's.

34:17.346 --> 34:18.222
I see.

34:19.681 --> 34:20.558
Hey.

34:24.145 --> 34:24.978
Why are you angry?

34:25.563 --> 34:27.732
What? I'm not angry.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.984
-Then what's wrong?
-Then what?

34:30.109 --> 34:34.781
Was I supposed to get all excited
and say how happy she must be?

34:39.577 --> 34:40.828
Hey, guys.

34:48.835 --> 34:50.420
I did an interview yesterday,
and I passed.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.090
I heard you introduced her.

34:54.884 --> 34:56.886
Look at these two beautiful ladies.

34:56.969 --> 34:59.013
We won't need to decorate the interior.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.016
They're not materials.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.229
What are you saying?

35:06.896 --> 35:07.855
Sua, let's go.

35:08.773 --> 35:09.732
I'll see you later.

35:16.906 --> 35:21.202
YOUNGLIM INDUSTRIALS

35:25.414 --> 35:26.916
Did something happen with her?

35:26.999 --> 35:28.042
No.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.088
Did she say something about us?

35:33.214 --> 35:34.215
No.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.635
I guess she did say something.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.890
<i>Why is he so quick-witted?</i>

35:46.102 --> 35:48.980
<i>Can you let me eat with Kyung-seok</i>
<i>in private later?</i>

Hello. Thank you.

Hello. Hi.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.357
Hello.

36:33.816 --> 36:34.942
Hi.

36:37.153 --> 36:39.030
I didn't tell you this yesterday

36:39.113 --> 36:41.741
because you might get angry
and not be able to sleep.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.868
But Kyung-hee moved into Ms. Na's place.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.704
Why are you telling me that now?

36:47.163 --> 36:49.916
-I would've slept better if you told me.
-Pardon?

36:51.667 --> 36:53.419
It's safer for her to be there.

36:56.964 --> 37:00.176
Yes, you're right. It is safer there.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.389
Did you sleep well?

37:06.307 --> 37:07.558
Come sit down.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.352
Okay.

37:15.858 --> 37:17.485
I haven't cooked in a while.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.862
Did I cook too much stuff?

37:21.447 --> 37:22.406
No.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.161
Thank you for the meal.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.634
It doesn't taste good, does it?

37:43.844 --> 37:44.679
It tastes okay.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.849
You don't have to lie.
It's obvious that I can't cook.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.894
I can't really taste food,

37:52.812 --> 37:54.855
so I rarely cook for myself.

37:55.439 --> 37:58.276
But I tried my best
by searching for recipes online.

38:03.197 --> 38:05.658
It's okay.
You don't need to force feed yourself.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.370
It doesn't taste so bad.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.209
And this tastes better.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.222
What should we eat?

38:28.723 --> 38:32.310
There's a nice pork cutlet place nearby,
and a cold noodles and dumplings place.

38:32.935 --> 38:34.270
Sua, what do you prefer?

38:34.770 --> 38:35.855
I want...

38:36.480 --> 38:37.606
Hey, Hae-sung.

38:39.275 --> 38:42.486
Can you work during lunchtime?
We have more customers than usual.

38:43.112 --> 38:43.946
Sure.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.824
I'd like one more volunteer.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.170
I can eat lunch later.

38:59.253 --> 39:01.797
Okay. Thank you. Let's go.

39:13.976 --> 39:16.020
I'm going to order pork cutlet.
You?

39:16.896 --> 39:18.147
Me too.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.941
-Two pork cutlets, please.
-Okay.

39:24.779 --> 39:28.199
I really like the working environment.
The people are nice as well.

39:28.783 --> 39:29.867
Why did you come here?

39:30.993 --> 39:34.663
I heard you guys are working together,
so I figured it'd be nice to join.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.125
Why are you so interested in us?

39:40.378 --> 39:43.297
-What do you mean?
-I know you're not that slow-witted.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.508
What?

39:46.092 --> 39:47.676
As for this product,

39:47.843 --> 39:51.222
the sink is facing the living room,
not the wall.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.891
So it enables you to talk to your kids

39:53.974 --> 39:57.520
or watch TV as you do the dishes.

39:57.770 --> 39:58.979
And on both sides...

39:59.480 --> 40:01.816
I know you didn't really like me at first.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.944
But we resolved our misunderstanding,

40:05.152 --> 40:07.738
so I thought we were slowly becoming
close friends.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.198
You didn't?

40:09.949 --> 40:10.825
That's enough.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.912
I want to be good friends with you.

40:14.995 --> 40:16.455
You don't like me.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.002
What do you want?

40:23.462 --> 40:25.297
I don't understand.

40:27.508 --> 40:28.968
Are you pretending again?

40:29.552 --> 40:30.469
Kyung-seok.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.098
Why do you always think of me
so negatively?

40:34.181 --> 40:36.100
Because that's how I perceive you.

40:37.351 --> 40:38.602
That's sad.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.774
I only did that
because I really wanted to be your friend.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.945
But I guess you think I'm pretentious
and a liar.

40:50.030 --> 40:54.410
If you're annoyed because it feels
as if I'm clinging onto you,

40:55.578 --> 40:56.579
I get it.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.416
I'll quit the job after today.

41:07.631 --> 41:08.716
Enjoy your meal.

41:23.939 --> 41:24.899
Mi-rae.

41:25.566 --> 41:28.152
-What's your relationship with Kyung-seok?
-Pardon?

41:28.235 --> 41:30.613
I mean, you look really close.

41:32.448 --> 41:33.491
We're just friends.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.576
Then is Sua his girlfriend?

41:36.452 --> 41:37.286
No.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.538
Are you dating anyone?

41:40.789 --> 41:41.665
No.

41:44.126 --> 41:45.377
Eat up.

41:49.423 --> 41:53.385
<i>The seventh local election will soon</i>
<i>come to an end at 6:00 p.m.</i>

41:53.469 --> 41:55.804
-Did you vote?
-Yes.

41:55.888 --> 41:59.225
Many young people participate actively
in voting these days.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.518
It's a good thing.

42:00.601 --> 42:01.852
<i>...the current status.</i>

42:01.936 --> 42:03.812
I wonder who'll win for Gangnam-gu.

42:03.896 --> 42:06.065
<i>Let's look into the overall voting rate.</i>

42:06.148 --> 42:08.192
Everyone's so crazy about Gangnam.

42:08.275 --> 42:11.362
Gangnam should always set a good example
for everything.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.906
People call my daughter "Gangnam Beauty."

42:14.448 --> 42:16.909
And that makes me more interested
in Gangnam.

42:16.992 --> 42:19.703
<i>Now, let's move</i>
<i>onto the local voting rates.</i>

42:19.787 --> 42:21.413
She's my daughter.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.165
<i>Let's check out the district</i>
<i>with the highest voting rate.</i>

42:23.249 --> 42:26.835
<i>Daejeon City has a voting rate</i>
<i>of 64 percent. It exceeded 60 percent.</i>

42:28.504 --> 42:30.965
<i>That's the estimated amount of votes.</i>

42:31.048 --> 42:34.760
<i>Now, let's move onto the traffic.</i>

42:34.843 --> 42:36.512
<i>In the morning, it will...</i>

42:42.810 --> 42:44.770
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

42:49.275 --> 42:50.276
Excuse me.

42:51.527 --> 42:52.444
Yes.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.739
I want a Gangnam-style haircut.

42:57.074 --> 42:58.867
What are you talking about?

42:59.368 --> 43:00.744
What kind of style is that?

43:01.036 --> 43:03.372
You're the hairdresser,
so you should know.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.458
But why, all of a sudden?

43:06.959 --> 43:08.502
Has something gotten into you?

43:09.795 --> 43:11.880
Well, to be honest, yes.

43:12.881 --> 43:16.844
People call Mi-rae "Gangnam Beauty".

43:17.386 --> 43:20.431
And I kind of want people
to think she takes after me.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.975
She's tall and slim just like you.

43:23.183 --> 43:25.603
Bring her sometime.
Let me see how much she's changed.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.607
Okay, I'll bring her over next time.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.991
It must be tiring to be so good-looking.

43:39.700 --> 43:42.870
It seems like Sua has a thing for you.

43:43.537 --> 43:45.789
But do you prefer girls like Mi-rae
than Sua?

43:46.999 --> 43:50.294
I'd definitely choose Sua over Mi-rae.

43:54.089 --> 43:57.217
But then again,
some people care more about the physique.

43:57.801 --> 44:01.263
If a girl had Sua's face
and Mi-rae's body, she'd be perfect.

44:14.526 --> 44:16.236
I didn't eat with Kyung-seok.

44:17.279 --> 44:18.113
What?

44:18.197 --> 44:21.116
He must've felt uncomfortable
to eat with me without you.

44:34.296 --> 44:35.547
<i>By the way,</i>

44:36.882 --> 44:38.467
I'm curious about something.

44:40.969 --> 44:43.555
She seems to have done
all the plastic surgeries.

44:43.889 --> 44:44.848
Her boobs are fake too?

44:45.557 --> 44:48.060
You can't really tell
just by looking them.

44:53.065 --> 44:54.358
Hey.

44:54.817 --> 44:55.984
Are you crazy?

44:58.946 --> 45:00.114
Have you gone insane?

45:07.121 --> 45:07.955
Scumbag.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.915
What's wrong with what I asked?

45:10.416 --> 45:12.835
What's wrong with talking about the truth?

45:12.918 --> 45:14.503
Let me go.

45:22.636 --> 45:23.762
Be quiet.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.685
Kyung-seok, don't.

45:29.935 --> 45:33.439
And I'm not interested in someone
who looks so cheap.

45:36.775 --> 45:38.193
-Kyung-seok.
-Gosh.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.236
Goodness.

45:40.112 --> 45:41.238
Kyung-seok.

45:43.031 --> 45:45.325
-Kyung-seok.
-K... Kyung-seok.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.035
-You punk.
-Kyung-seok.

45:47.119 --> 45:49.413
-Kyung-seok.
-What's wrong with you?

45:49.997 --> 45:51.665
This punk hit me first.

45:51.915 --> 45:53.667
I got beaten up by him.

45:54.001 --> 45:57.504
If you have hit back at least once,
you're both to blame.

45:58.547 --> 46:02.217
You all seem like students,
so talk it out and make up--

46:02.301 --> 46:04.094
I said I wouldn't...

46:05.429 --> 46:08.599
unless he bows his head and apologizes.

46:09.266 --> 46:12.478
Unless he bows and apologizes sincerely,

46:12.936 --> 46:14.229
I'll sue him.

46:14.313 --> 46:17.649
It seems like you've hit him a lot more.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.610
Why don't you apologize
and settle it out?

46:26.325 --> 46:27.242
I'm sorry.

46:30.204 --> 46:32.581
I should've killed him
so that he couldn't even talk.

46:35.209 --> 46:37.377
Has he gone crazy or what?

46:37.461 --> 46:38.921
-Sit down.
-Hey.

46:39.338 --> 46:41.465
Do you want to be an ex-convict?

46:46.178 --> 46:47.054
You jerk.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.432
Shouldn't you be apologizing to me?

46:51.183 --> 46:55.020
If you have at least
the slightest sense of guilt, let him go.

46:58.732 --> 47:00.943
-I don't want to.
-What?

47:02.152 --> 47:04.696
I was going to tell you,

47:05.280 --> 47:07.533
but he tried to hit on me too.

47:08.992 --> 47:11.745
Don't worry.
The company will take care of this matter.

47:12.371 --> 47:13.288
Go back to work.

47:13.705 --> 47:14.581
Okay.

47:16.166 --> 47:18.168
I should've fired him sooner.

47:23.215 --> 47:26.134
Yes, I thought the room could use
a bit more decoration.

47:27.219 --> 47:29.012
Tell me if there's a specific design
in mind.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.558
Okay, bye.

47:43.735 --> 47:49.408
NA HYE-SUNG APPOINTED
AS THE CEO OF KELLUN

47:50.951 --> 47:54.580
-Are you looking for something?
-I'm just looking around.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.833
Take a look around
and tell me if you need me.

48:04.089 --> 48:06.091
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

48:06.675 --> 48:09.219
Doesn't a guy named Do Kyung-seok
work here?

48:09.303 --> 48:10.971
Kyung-seok?

48:11.722 --> 48:15.767
Yes, but he's not here right now.
What's the matter?

48:17.311 --> 48:19.605
I'm his mom. Did he go somewhere?

48:19.688 --> 48:21.607
Oh, hello.

48:22.107 --> 48:24.985
I'm Hyun Sua, his friend in college.

48:25.068 --> 48:27.571
Is that right?

48:28.572 --> 48:31.241
But he's...

48:33.285 --> 48:35.370
Why? Did something happen?

48:36.496 --> 48:37.497
Yes.

48:38.624 --> 48:41.793
He was taken to a police station
because he got into a fight.

48:41.877 --> 48:42.836
What?

48:43.629 --> 48:45.088
Why would he?

48:45.672 --> 48:47.132
Whom did he fight with?

48:48.175 --> 48:49.927
With another part-timer here,

48:51.136 --> 48:54.598
he got into a fight
because of a girl named Kang Mi-rae.

48:54.681 --> 48:55.766
Mi-rae?

48:56.433 --> 48:57.809
Do you know her?

48:58.685 --> 48:59.686
Yes.

49:00.228 --> 49:02.564
She lives in Kyung-seok's neighborhood.

49:05.359 --> 49:06.318
I see.

49:07.319 --> 49:09.404
<i>How impressive, Mi-rae.</i>

49:09.863 --> 49:12.449
Do you know which police station it is?

49:13.575 --> 49:14.868
Please give me a minute.

49:20.332 --> 49:21.541
Good.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.544
I've hurt you with words,
so I'll apologize the same way.

49:24.628 --> 49:27.756
Mi-rae, I'm sorry, satisfied?

49:27.839 --> 49:30.175
That's not the attitude
of someone apologizing.

49:30.258 --> 49:32.511
This punk hit me, so he should kneel down.

49:33.303 --> 49:35.430
Or let me punch him 10 times.

49:35.514 --> 49:38.475
All right. Do as you want
because I'll go by the law too.

49:38.558 --> 49:39.476
What?

49:42.771 --> 49:45.065
Hello, sir. This is Mi-rae.

49:46.316 --> 49:49.987
I'm still at the police station,
but I have a favor to ask you.

49:51.822 --> 49:52.739
What?

49:56.201 --> 49:57.369
I see.

49:58.370 --> 50:00.247
Okay, thank you.

50:03.875 --> 50:05.252
He said you're fired.

50:06.795 --> 50:11.925
The manager says he'll testify
how you sexually harassed me if he has to.

50:12.509 --> 50:14.886
Should I file a lawsuit?

50:14.970 --> 50:16.054
No.

50:16.513 --> 50:17.723
Hold on.

50:18.390 --> 50:20.183
What are you going to do?

50:23.228 --> 50:24.479
Kyung-seok.

50:30.569 --> 50:31.945
Do you hit people?

50:34.740 --> 50:35.741
Ms. Na.

50:37.284 --> 50:38.744
I came from the store.

50:40.245 --> 50:43.457
How could you not even call me
in this kind of situation?

50:49.921 --> 50:52.382
<i>Next is the exit poll in Daejin.</i>

50:53.008 --> 50:56.219
<i>66.7 percent for candidate number one,</i>
<i>Do Sang-won.</i>

50:56.803 --> 51:00.057
-Yes!
<i>-23.2 percent for...</i>

51:00.140 --> 51:03.018
Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang-won.

51:03.101 --> 51:06.313
Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang-won.

51:06.396 --> 51:07.898
-Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
-Thank you.

51:07.981 --> 51:10.150
Now, take some rest in your house.

51:10.233 --> 51:11.193
All right.

51:11.860 --> 51:14.571
I was worried
your children might cause trouble,

51:14.654 --> 51:18.200
-but I'm glad they didn't.
-I didn't raise them like that.

51:18.283 --> 51:19.868
They wouldn't cause trouble.

51:19.951 --> 51:21.244
Sure thing.

51:21.328 --> 51:22.913
-See you.
-Do Sang-won.

51:22.996 --> 51:28.919
Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang-won.

51:29.002 --> 51:30.420
Mayor of Daejin...

51:33.048 --> 51:34.299
He did deserve a beating.

51:35.133 --> 51:40.597
Still, you shouldn't punish him
in a way which could harm you as well.

51:40.680 --> 51:43.266
Mi-rae must've gotten hurt a lot.

51:44.351 --> 51:45.352
Are you okay?

51:46.144 --> 51:47.062
Yes?

51:48.146 --> 51:49.022
Yes.

51:49.106 --> 51:50.649
You must've been startled.

51:57.405 --> 52:02.536
I thought I'd be okay if I thought I was.

52:06.498 --> 52:08.250
I guess I wasn't okay.

52:16.842 --> 52:17.759
Mi-rae.

52:18.510 --> 52:20.762
You haven't done anything wrong today.

52:21.304 --> 52:23.348
People like him have wrong thoughts.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.062
Right.

52:34.025 --> 52:36.069
Please excuse me now.

52:38.905 --> 52:40.115
I'm okay.

52:45.162 --> 52:46.413
Don't go alone.

52:48.248 --> 52:49.583
Let's eat and go together.

52:51.042 --> 52:52.294
Right, Mi-rae.

52:52.627 --> 52:53.795
Go home together.

52:58.633 --> 52:59.467
Let's go.

53:09.769 --> 53:10.812
Hey, Kyung-hee.

53:11.730 --> 53:14.649
It looks like you'll have to have dinner
alone. I'm sorry.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.444
There's some fried rice in the fridge.

53:18.945 --> 53:20.030
I'm sorry.

53:21.406 --> 53:22.782
WHERE DID DOVELY GO?

53:22.866 --> 53:24.201
WILL SHE FINALLY SHOW HER FACE?

53:24.284 --> 53:25.327
Ta-da.

53:25.410 --> 53:26.828
SHE IS SO CUTE!

53:26.912 --> 53:28.413
SHE HAS IT ALL

53:28.496 --> 53:29.831
DO NOT WEAR THE MASK FROM NOW ON.

53:29.915 --> 53:30.957
Yes, that's right.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.710
Because I don't have my mask today.

53:34.836 --> 53:37.047
And I won't be eating in my room today.

53:37.631 --> 53:41.468
I'm outside now and I'll host my show
while enjoying this night view here.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.511
What's for dinner today?

53:43.595 --> 53:45.013
HAVE YOU MOVED?

53:45.096 --> 53:46.181
I'll have fried rice.

53:46.264 --> 53:47.891
IT LOOKS LIKE A DIFFERENT SHOW.

53:47.974 --> 53:49.643
IS THAT A SPECIAL ONE?

53:49.726 --> 53:51.144
This fried rice <i>is </i>special.

53:51.686 --> 53:52.979
My mom made it.

53:55.774 --> 53:57.067
Then I'll dig in now.

53:57.943 --> 53:59.653
I'll take a big spoonful...

53:59.736 --> 54:01.529
IS THERE LOBSTER IN IT?

54:01.613 --> 54:03.490
YOUR MOM NEVER COOKED IT FOR YOU?

54:03.573 --> 54:05.283
WHY WOULD SHE COOK IN A RICH FAMILY?

54:05.367 --> 54:07.077
My first time tasting my mom's fried rice.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.662
MOM'S FRIED RICE IS THE BEST.

54:08.745 --> 54:09.829
I'd rate this...

54:09.913 --> 54:11.206
I WANT TO SEE HER MOM.

54:11.289 --> 54:12.666
FROZEN FRIED RICE IS THE BEST.

54:12.749 --> 54:13.667
100 out of 100.

54:13.750 --> 54:15.335
SHE IS SO LOVELY WHEN SHE EATS.

54:16.836 --> 54:19.881
There's a lot of meat in it.

54:20.966 --> 54:22.467
There are raisins too.

55:54.768 --> 55:55.977
Thank you for the dinner.

55:57.437 --> 55:59.606
Mi-rae, could you wait for us in the car?

56:00.190 --> 56:02.317
I have to talk to him about something.

56:03.151 --> 56:03.985
Sure.

56:12.077 --> 56:13.661
You got yourself in trouble,

56:14.245 --> 56:16.956
but I could act as your guardian
for the first time.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.042
It doesn't feel that bad.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.463
From now on, call me if anything happens.

56:23.922 --> 56:26.049
-Okay.
-And...

56:27.300 --> 56:28.843
About your tuition...

56:30.095 --> 56:31.679
Could I take care of it for you?

56:33.181 --> 56:35.016
It's not like I'm a stranger to you.

56:35.100 --> 56:36.142
I'm...

56:37.727 --> 56:38.937
your mom after all.

56:39.771 --> 56:41.606
I hope you let me pay it.

56:47.445 --> 56:48.279
Okay.

56:49.614 --> 56:50.573
Really?

56:52.033 --> 56:54.536
I was so anxious,
thinking you'd say no.

57:00.458 --> 57:02.710
-Thanks.
-For what?

57:03.753 --> 57:04.712
I'll...

57:06.256 --> 57:07.090
pay you back.

57:18.476 --> 57:19.310
Thanks for today.

57:20.311 --> 57:23.815
But from now on,
don't punch people because of me.

57:25.817 --> 57:26.943
Don't worry.

57:30.488 --> 57:32.073
I'm not mad at you.

57:37.162 --> 57:39.956
I'm just frustrated
that all I can do is punch people.

57:40.039 --> 57:42.333
Those jerks should not gossip about you.

57:47.130 --> 57:48.256
You must still be all shaken up.

57:49.632 --> 57:50.675
You should go in.

57:54.095 --> 57:55.263
Okay, thanks.

57:56.764 --> 57:58.850
You should get going. I'll head in, then.

58:04.230 --> 58:05.440
Mi-rae.

58:20.580 --> 58:21.539
If...

58:24.792 --> 58:26.878
something like that happens to you again,

58:30.381 --> 58:32.175
I'll get involved without punching.

58:35.720 --> 58:36.971
That will be okay, right?

58:42.602 --> 58:44.687
If you keep saying things like that,

58:46.981 --> 58:48.650
I'll get the wrong idea.

58:50.985 --> 58:52.070
About what?

58:53.780 --> 58:55.740
Just like how I'm feeling, you might...

59:03.164 --> 59:04.207
Never mind.

59:05.083 --> 59:07.043
Get going. I'm going to head in.

59:19.264 --> 59:20.098
Do you have...

59:25.436 --> 59:26.771
any feelings for me?

59:28.022 --> 59:28.856
What?

59:58.052 --> 59:59.596
Are you free on Wednesday?

59:59.679 --> 1:00:01.306
Just the two of us.
I have something to tell you.

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:04.017
If you think that we can go back
to how we were before,

1:00:04.100 --> 1:00:06.686
-I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
-Anything bothering you?

1:00:06.769 --> 1:00:08.354
I think I'm just scared.

1:00:08.438 --> 1:00:12.233
He's way too good for me.
He's too perfect.

1:00:12.317 --> 1:00:14.569
Hey, I told you that enough is enough.

1:00:15.486 --> 1:00:16.988
Why must you mess everything up?

1:00:17.572 --> 1:00:18.823
You still don't feel anything?

1:00:18.906 --> 1:00:21.200
If you're having a hard time
because of me,

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:22.994
I shouldn't do it.

1:00:23.077 --> 1:00:25.288
But I'll wait for you.
