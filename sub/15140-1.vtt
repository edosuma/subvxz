[applause]

00:04.537 --> 00:09.642
[singing America the Beautiful
in French]

00:17.650 --> 00:21.154
[whispering, indistinct]

00:23.022 --> 00:25.258
[whispering, indistinct]

00:38.771 --> 00:41.407
What's going on?

00:43.176 --> 00:45.645
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.481
We weren't given any warning
of their arrival.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.949
OK.

00:50.016 --> 00:53.019
We felt it best that we come here
and tell you personally.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.755
This came on us like a sneak attack.

00:55.822 --> 00:58.524
- Safe to join?
- Just give us another second, Rod.

00:58.591 --> 00:59.926
He's my chief of staff, Jim.

01:00.893 --> 01:03.596
The president has
a bleeding aneurysm in his brain.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.470
- How bad?
- Bad.

01:10.536 --> 01:13.273
It caused a massive stroke.
When should we get word?

01:13.339 --> 01:16.142
Two hours. Maybe three.
Surgery seems to be going well.

01:16.209 --> 01:18.444
It is, nonetheless, major surgery.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.947
He'll be incapacitated
for we don't know how long.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.782
It'll be months of rehabilitation.

01:22.849 --> 01:26.119
The doc explained these
things come out of nowhere.

01:26.185 --> 01:28.988
Usually there's no symptoms
until the thing ruptures.

01:29.055 --> 01:31.924
You get headaches,
blurry vision, episodes of confusion.

01:31.991 --> 01:34.360
He's not gonna be in condition
to stay in office.

01:34.427 --> 01:39.098
The 25th Amendment would kick in. The
vice president assumes the presidency.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.403
OK. Um...

01:43.469 --> 01:47.140
Melanie, um... what happens now?
Do I take the oath or...?

01:51.744 --> 01:52.745
What?

01:53.513 --> 01:55.014
We need you to resign, Mac.

01:55.081 --> 01:58.518
You see, if you resign,
Nathan Templeton could move into office.

01:58.584 --> 02:00.987
Oh, I know it'd move
Nathan Templeton into office.

02:01.054 --> 02:04.223
Why would I want to move
this speaker of the house into office?

02:04.290 --> 02:07.894
You are an Independent. We need
a Republican head of the administration.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.263
Bridges picked Mac to succeed him if...

02:10.330 --> 02:14.000
Just... This is coming
from the president?

02:14.067 --> 02:15.668
This is the president's intent.

02:15.735 --> 02:19.339
I have no idea what that means. Did
the president tell you this directly?

02:19.405 --> 02:22.075
He was being wheeled into brain surgery.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.643
We got hell on earth afoot.

02:23.710 --> 02:27.547
We got Korea, Syria, Iran. Things are
too unstable. We don't need the world...

02:27.613 --> 02:30.683
...to see a soft, indecisive woman
commanding the troops,

02:30.750 --> 02:33.086
as opposed
to Nathan "Bloody Hell" Templeton?

02:36.622 --> 02:39.559
Madam Vice President,
I must insist that you consider...

02:39.625 --> 02:42.595
Jim, you're not in a position
to insist how I take my coffee.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.872
That said... how would this work?

02:52.939 --> 02:55.608
- I resign...
- No, no. You don't have to.

02:55.675 --> 02:59.612
Tell them that you could not
follow the ideals of this president.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.381
Then what?

03:01.447 --> 03:05.451
I... make a deal with Random House
to write a book?

03:08.454 --> 03:10.423
Air Force Two
can be wheels up in an hour.

03:10.490 --> 03:14.160
OK, when we're in the air,
I want to speak to the chairman.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.329
Chairman?

03:16.396 --> 03:17.663
Of the Joint Chiefs?

03:17.730 --> 03:21.467
Yes, Jim. Of the Joint Chiefs.

03:28.474 --> 03:31.811
[singing America the Beautiful

03:33.179 --> 03:35.448
[shouting in French]

04:12.018 --> 04:13.786
Mackenzie, call's ready.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.455
Good. What have you heard?

04:15.521 --> 04:18.357
The president is still in surgery
but they are confident.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.392
- There's been nothing on the news.
- No.

04:20.459 --> 04:24.230
Media's in the dark. It's a good lid.
I had OMB send some bill summaries.

04:24.297 --> 04:27.366
You know, we have to reschedule
with the French. I got no...

04:27.433 --> 04:30.603
I know how important this is to you.
But you saw, right?

04:30.670 --> 04:32.805
The French are not
gonna help us in Nigeria.

04:32.872 --> 04:36.509
If you assume the presidency, this
can't be the first thing you jump into.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.177
If I have to assume office,

04:38.244 --> 04:41.481
the Nigerians are gonna move up
the execution of Oria Madula.

04:41.547 --> 04:45.218
They will bury this woman in sand
up to her neck and stone her to death.

04:45.284 --> 04:47.920
That can't be the first result
of my presidency.

04:48.012 --> 04:50.681
Uh, the twins.
The Secret Service is getting them home?

04:50.723 --> 04:52.558
- Yeah.
- [whistle blows]

04:52.625 --> 04:55.127
[man shouting]

04:57.663 --> 05:00.233
[man] Here he is.
Got him right here. Horace!

05:02.602 --> 05:04.637
- What's up, Ted?
- We gotta go.

05:04.704 --> 05:07.206
- I have a few sprints left.
- No. We don't have time.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.308
- We gotta get you home.
- What's going on?

05:09.375 --> 05:11.844
We have instructions
to get you to the residence.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.747
- [woman] Becca?
- Oh, Joan!

05:14.814 --> 05:16.415
I got her.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.284
- We were just...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.886
I'll call you.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.555
Let's go.

05:23.422 --> 05:25.191
Bye.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.927
- We're coming out.
- [man on walkie-talkie] Copy that.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.732
- [man] Madam Vice President?
- [Jim] Got the JCS on line three.

05:32.798 --> 05:35.768
Thank you. Would you
bring up the carriers, please?

05:36.936 --> 05:39.805
General Pollack,
this is the vice president.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.107
- Yes, ma'am.
- General,

05:41.173 --> 05:43.809
uh, you're aware
of the president's condition?

05:43.876 --> 05:45.211
Yes, ma'am. How's he doing?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.313
We're, uh... we're hoping for the best.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.449
But should things become more...

05:50.516 --> 05:54.320
...serious or should news
of the president's condition get out,

05:54.387 --> 05:56.322
we would move to a higher DEFCON.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.557
That's SOP.

05:57.623 --> 06:01.160
OK, um, I'd like to elevate
our readiness posture now.

06:01.227 --> 06:02.728
- Let's not wait.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.297
May I ask what you're doing?

06:04.363 --> 06:07.800
Uh, also, let's get
our carriers to our hot spots.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.736
I see that the Truman is in the Med?

06:10.803 --> 06:13.406
Annual NATO friendship maneuvers.

06:13.472 --> 06:16.809
Hmm. Well, give our regrets to NATO
and move her over to Gaza.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.279
I want the Kitty Hawk…
sitting on Pyongyang.

06:20.346 --> 06:24.450
And, um... the Tarawa, does
the Tarawa have extraction teams?

06:24.517 --> 06:26.085
United States Marine Corps.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.488
Good. That's all for now, general.
I'll leave you to your work.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.590
Yes, ma'am.

06:30.656 --> 06:34.260
What do I tell the president when he
asks why you put our Navy on high alert?

06:34.327 --> 06:36.896
He won't ask. He'll know.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.975
Madam Vice President, we need
to discuss the remarks Kelly wrote

06:49.041 --> 06:51.377
for the DAR event this evening
when we get back.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.813
Give it to me.
I'll take a look. Gentlemen.

06:53.879 --> 06:56.682
- Don't forget about the EPA speech.
- OK. Thanks.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.852
Rod. This is not going to stand.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.320
What are you talking about?

07:01.387 --> 07:04.957
I don't know if this is some last
hurrah crap. But what is she thinking?

07:05.024 --> 07:08.127
Taking over the military like that.
It's like a coup d'état!

07:08.194 --> 07:12.031
I know what you're going through, but
you need to choose your tone carefully.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.267
It's my job to protect the vital
interests of the vice president

07:15.334 --> 07:19.071
and the United States,
and in this case they are the same.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.875
Clear out of your office, Jim.

07:23.809 --> 07:26.379
[boy] You're next in line.
That's the rule.

07:26.445 --> 07:30.316
- That's the Constitution.
- It's more complicated than that.

07:30.383 --> 07:33.419
Are you going to get a chance
to speak to the president?

07:33.486 --> 07:35.855
When he gets out of recovery.

07:36.622 --> 07:40.259
I, uh... think I know your opinion.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.962
Don't worry, Mom. I'll be dutiful.

07:43.029 --> 07:46.465
I don't want you to be dutiful.
I just don't want you to be a hypocrite.

07:47.533 --> 07:51.303
I just think that the people voted
for what President Bridges believes in.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.172
You mean what you believe in.

07:54.573 --> 07:56.442
[sighs] I just...

07:56.509 --> 07:59.845
You know, if you can't deliver,
then maybe you should step aside.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.088
What about you?
What do you think?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.990
Will they put your face on money?

08:12.324 --> 08:16.262
Um… you know what? They already
have faces on all the money.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.898
But maybe if I do a really good job,

08:18.964 --> 08:22.134
they'll make, like,
a 15-dollar bill, just for me.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.104
Staff's assembled, ma'am.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.974
Thank you. Now remember,
this is a really big secret, so…

08:31.977 --> 08:33.879
OK. See you, guys.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.850
- [man 1] Good afternoon.
- [man 2] Ma'am.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.485
Thank you for coming.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.120
Madam Vice President.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.054
Let's go talk it out.

08:43.121 --> 08:44.690
[clock chimes]

08:44.757 --> 08:47.560
We should probably get
an NSC brief. First thing.

08:47.626 --> 08:49.195
Should Templeton be in on that?

08:49.261 --> 08:51.831
No, no. Right now,
we keep Templeton out of the mix.

08:51.897 --> 08:53.766
We really need to talk about Nigeria.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.236
If you become president, you're
damned if you do, damned if you don't.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.672
If you continue to try
to get Oria Madula out,

08:59.739 --> 09:02.308
you're focusing foreign policy
on just one person.

09:02.374 --> 09:05.578
If she doesn't... Ma'am,
if you don't help, she will be executed.

09:05.644 --> 09:06.746
[telephone rings]

09:06.812 --> 09:09.648
[Rebecca] Hey.
Someone wants to say good night.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.250
Oh.

09:12.251 --> 09:14.754
- Good night, baby girl.
- Good night.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.456
- Hey.
- Good night, Daddy.

09:17.523 --> 09:18.924
- Good night.
- I love you.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.926
OK. I love you. We'll get right on...

09:20.993 --> 09:23.496
Guys, I'm going to take
that NSC meeting by myself.

09:24.563 --> 09:26.398
Mac...

09:26.465 --> 09:27.900
...the president's awake.

09:29.168 --> 09:30.536
He wants to see you.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.910
[elevator bell rings]

09:39.645 --> 09:41.747
How is he?

09:41.814 --> 09:45.551
He seems OK.
Surprisingly lucid, considering.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.463
- I love this man.
- I know.

10:03.102 --> 10:06.105
Hey, boss. How are you feeling?

10:06.739 --> 10:09.041
Like crap.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.876
Anything I can do?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.478
Well,

10:12.545 --> 10:16.949
doctors say I'll be a year
in rehab just to talk straight.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.753
Uh.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.656
Finally took God to nail me.

10:26.425 --> 10:30.963
I hear you reorganized
the Sixth Fleet while I was napping.

10:31.030 --> 10:34.867
I was bored. I'd already read
all the magazines on the plane.

10:36.735 --> 10:39.238
You're gonna pluck her out, huh?

10:39.305 --> 10:41.807
- If I have the opportunity.
- It's a mistake.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.645
You gave Jim Gardner a coronary.

10:49.915 --> 10:51.584
[sighs]

10:54.420 --> 10:56.188
Mac…

10:58.490 --> 11:01.927
I want you to hear this from me.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.129
I want...

11:06.031 --> 11:09.602
I need you to resign.

11:16.308 --> 11:19.411
Sir, would you really rather have
Nathan Templeton?

11:19.478 --> 11:23.716
You and I, Mac,
we just see a different America.

11:24.550 --> 11:25.818
[exhales]

11:25.885 --> 11:28.954
Templeton's an SOB and a liar
and he cheats at poker.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.523
But he shares my vision...

11:32.291 --> 11:34.460
...supports my will.

11:35.661 --> 11:38.063
You tell me...

11:38.130 --> 11:39.732
...in your heart...

11:39.798 --> 11:42.668
...that you'd do the same.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.876
I will not resign...

11:51.777 --> 11:53.913
...until you do.

12:09.828 --> 12:11.463
[siren wails]

12:13.465 --> 12:15.434
Well, chancellor,

12:15.501 --> 12:17.036
I come here, hat in hand.

12:17.102 --> 12:20.673
You know, it's university policy
not to endorse any candidate.

12:20.739 --> 12:25.344
- I don't place stock in endorsements.
- You're probably right about that.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.781
You've done a hell of a job
here at the University of Richmond.

12:28.847 --> 12:30.950
I mean, your leadership's unquestioned.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.185
Your research
that's coming out of here...

12:33.252 --> 12:36.088
How many Nobel Prizes
do you have now?

12:36.155 --> 12:40.292
And your expertise in Middle Eastern
politics, it's impeccable.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.328
Thank you.

12:42.394 --> 12:46.432
Well, hell, Mackenzie, I'm just
gonna come straight out and ask you.

12:46.498 --> 12:48.367
I want you to be my running mate.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.704
Surprised?

12:51.770 --> 12:54.506
Did you just ask me
to be your vice president?

12:54.573 --> 12:56.008
Mm-hm.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.510
Then yes, I'm surprised.

12:58.577 --> 13:00.679
Well...

13:00.746 --> 13:02.481
...here I am, champ.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.351
Asking you to join my team.

13:05.417 --> 13:08.420
To become the first
woman vice president.

13:09.254 --> 13:11.757
- And the first Independent.
- I know, I know.

13:11.824 --> 13:15.627
You walked away from Congress because
you didn't want to play the "yes" game.

13:15.694 --> 13:17.029
I... I respect that.

13:17.096 --> 13:20.599
Look, I had four years in Congress.
Four years.

13:20.666 --> 13:24.103
The press is gonna devour me
over my lack of experience.

13:24.169 --> 13:27.673
We've had experience in the White House.
What's it gotten us?

13:27.740 --> 13:31.310
Watergate, Vietnam,
Iran-gate, WMD-gate.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.645
I want somebody
who hasn't learned the game

13:33.712 --> 13:36.548
of survival by deception.

13:36.615 --> 13:38.751
I want intellect. I want…

13:38.817 --> 13:42.588
You want someone who can help with
a 40 percent approval rating with women.

13:42.654 --> 13:44.490
Hell, Mackenzie.

13:44.556 --> 13:48.360
If my raw need for power is what
opens the door for a woman, so what?

13:49.628 --> 13:51.030
And as for the media,

13:51.096 --> 13:54.900
kiddo, you're gonna be a star.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.869
[door opens]

13:56.935 --> 13:58.203
Hey.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.608
- Hey, Kelly.
- Sorry to rouse you, Kelly.

14:03.075 --> 14:04.877
Sure.

14:06.211 --> 14:09.982
- [siren wails]
- What's going on?

14:10.783 --> 14:13.719
The president has had a stroke.
From a bleeding aneurysm.

14:13.786 --> 14:17.056
He's not gonna be able
to remain in office.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.224
I need you to write
a resignation speech.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.894
Uh... wouldn't the president
want Kevin to write it?

14:22.728 --> 14:24.329
It's not for him. It's for me.

14:26.465 --> 14:29.001
The Oval Office should now be filled

14:29.068 --> 14:31.870
by someone who shares
the vision of President Bridges...

14:31.937 --> 14:33.572
As in Nathan Templeton? Come on.

14:33.639 --> 14:36.308
This guy makes Genghis Khan
look like Mahatma Gandhi.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.977
- Not like I haven't thought about this.
- Ma'am.

14:39.711 --> 14:42.081
Just take out your pen and write.

14:42.147 --> 14:44.583
"The desire to see a woman
in presidential office

14:44.650 --> 14:47.386
- cannot be as important as..."
- Return of book burning,

14:47.453 --> 14:50.689
creationism in the classroom,
invading every little country...

14:50.756 --> 14:55.027
- Shut up. We have to get this done.
- We don't have to get this done.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.830
We should be in there
talking some sense into her.

14:57.896 --> 15:00.599
Templeton cannot be our president.
Not on my watch.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.000
Your watch?

15:05.737 --> 15:07.306
Kelly.

15:07.372 --> 15:10.542
A female... president.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.382
Can't you smell the history?

15:17.449 --> 15:19.218
It's not my job to smell history.

15:20.285 --> 15:22.955
Why do you think we're here?

15:23.021 --> 15:24.857
For moments like this.

15:24.923 --> 15:29.261
We're here because though
she may be great, she isn't perfect.

15:30.762 --> 15:34.032
She is making a horrible decision.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.701
But she's made it.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.573
You sure about this?

15:41.640 --> 15:43.308
Of course not.

15:44.743 --> 15:46.979
He asked me to resign.

15:47.045 --> 15:48.981
If you could have just heard him...

15:49.047 --> 15:51.350
I wasn't there. And that's the point.

15:51.416 --> 15:53.986
So I can... I can look
at this thing objectively.

15:55.821 --> 15:58.123
Look, this is what we do.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.058
We do the right thing.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.661
You have a country
full of people who believe in you.

16:02.728 --> 16:06.131
Well, I have a president who doesn't,

16:06.198 --> 16:08.000
a cabinet who doesn't.

16:08.066 --> 16:12.004
I have a daughter who'd rather see Pat
Buchanan in office than her old lady.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.975
[beeping]

16:17.042 --> 16:18.777
[flatline tone]

16:18.844 --> 16:20.612
[woman] Flatline!

16:20.679 --> 16:22.080
[man] Clear!

16:22.147 --> 16:24.349
- No response!
- Charging.

16:24.416 --> 16:26.618
Clear!

16:27.452 --> 16:29.588
[man] Go to 300!

16:31.023 --> 16:32.791
[woman] No rhythm!

16:32.858 --> 16:35.427
[man] Charge… clear!

16:35.494 --> 16:37.729
No response! 400!

16:37.796 --> 16:39.431
Stay with us, sir!

16:40.699 --> 16:42.668
Clear!

16:42.734 --> 16:45.771
[woman] I can't get a reading!
Still not responding.

16:45.837 --> 16:49.141
Oh, Jim, I‘m so sorry.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.010
There was a massive
bleeding into his brain.

16:52.077 --> 16:56.248
The doctor said there was
a good chance this might happen.

16:56.315 --> 17:00.252
- Mr. Chief Justice.
- Madam Vice President.

17:00.319 --> 17:03.889
Mr. Chief Justice,
we'll be meeting in the study.

17:03.906 --> 17:05.941
Mr. Templeton.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.964
I'm devastated.

17:13.531 --> 17:17.603
Well, at this point, you are technically
the president of the United States.

17:17.669 --> 17:20.239
Unless, of course,
you should choose to resign.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.007
That why you're here, Nathan?

17:22.708 --> 17:26.877
Ready to take the oath as soon
as I do the right thing and step aside?

17:27.813 --> 17:30.315
Would you all give me
a few minutes with Ms. Allen?

17:37.723 --> 17:40.125
It's going fast, isn't it?

17:40.192 --> 17:41.860
That's what I resent.

17:41.927 --> 17:45.731
I resent that I don't have time
to mourn my friend.

17:45.797 --> 17:49.201
Ship of state just sails on regardless.

17:50.269 --> 17:54.306
They told me that
he asked you to step down.

17:54.373 --> 17:55.974
And I think you should.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.609
I'm sure that you do.

17:57.676 --> 18:00.879
You know, I'm not telling you
to do it out of respect for his wishes,

18:00.946 --> 18:05.083
and certainly not because
of anything I might want for myself.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.786
The world's in turmoil, Mac.
It could go any which way.

18:07.853 --> 18:11.556
This is not the time for social advances

18:11.623 --> 18:13.525
made for the sake of social advances.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.061
Meaning a woman in the Oval Office.

18:16.128 --> 18:19.031
No. Meaning a woman
as the leader of the free world.

18:19.097 --> 18:23.869
How many Islamic states would follow
the edicts of a woman? Very few, I fear.

18:23.935 --> 18:26.471
Well, not only that, Nathan,
but we have that whole

18:26.538 --> 18:29.908
"once a month, will she
or won't she press the button" thing.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.146
Well,

18:34.212 --> 18:37.249
a couple years, you're not
gonna have to worry about that.

18:38.016 --> 18:41.620
You know that your vice-presidency
was never ever intended

18:41.687 --> 18:44.489
to be a presidency.
It was done as a stunt.

18:44.556 --> 18:48.193
I mean, you can see that.
You're a female. You're an Independent.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.696
- You're a teacher.
- University chancellor.

18:50.762 --> 18:53.198
Hey. A philosopher queen.

18:53.265 --> 18:57.369
But the point is, it was all done
as pure theater,

18:57.436 --> 18:58.837
and you got great reviews.

18:58.904 --> 19:02.407
But now you should get off the stage
while the audience still loves you,

19:02.474 --> 19:05.877
before they figure out that your
vice-presidency was a lot of nothing.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.914
Because when they get a look
at that “go away” mission

19:08.980 --> 19:12.451
he sent you on to Al... Nigeria
for what's her name?

19:12.517 --> 19:15.554
- The adulteress?
- Oria Madula.

19:15.620 --> 19:18.790
Yeah. It was supposed
to be another piece of theater.

19:18.857 --> 19:22.627
But then you up and went to France
and asked them for assistance. France?

19:22.694 --> 19:26.998
You asked guys who can't get elected
without the Muslim vote

19:27.065 --> 19:31.636
to intercede in the verdict of Nigerian
sharia court? Come on, Mac.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.573
Ugh! We're gonna end up
looking silly and ineffectual

19:34.639 --> 19:37.042
because you're never
gonna be able to save her

19:37.109 --> 19:39.544
and we're gonna lose face,
and for whom?

19:39.611 --> 19:42.314
A lady who couldn't
keep her legs together.

19:52.591 --> 19:53.692
Nate.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.928
I'm gonna go out there,

19:56.995 --> 19:59.331
and I'm gonna take the oath of office.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.466
I'm gonna run this government.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.903
If some Islamic nations
can't tolerate a female president,

20:04.970 --> 20:06.972
it will be more their problem than mine.

20:07.773 --> 20:12.444
Why? Why do you want to be president?

20:12.511 --> 20:14.045
Same reason Teddy Bridges did.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.581
I believe the people
of America deserve to have...

20:16.648 --> 20:18.083
No.

20:19.050 --> 20:22.921
In this room, where it's just you
and me, just the two of us,

20:22.988 --> 20:26.391
the answer that you should be giving
me is that you want to be president

20:26.458 --> 20:28.093
because you want the power.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.362
You want the power
to control the universe.

20:30.429 --> 20:33.665
- That's not me.
- Well, that's the problem.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.001
That's what I'm telling you.

20:36.067 --> 20:39.171
People who don't want power
have no idea what to do with it.

20:39.237 --> 20:41.840
They have no idea
how to use it when they have it.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.476
Mr. Speaker, I would
very much like an invitation

20:44.543 --> 20:47.379
to address a joint session
of Congress tomorrow night.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.215
- Before the funeral?
- Before the markets open.

20:50.282 --> 20:53.685
We want to convince the world
there's no crisis of leadership. Right?

20:53.752 --> 20:55.687
Do you have a Bible handy?

20:55.754 --> 20:57.689
Becca, what about
that one in your room?

20:57.756 --> 20:59.458
Here.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.760
Use mine.

21:10.635 --> 21:13.205
[man] I, Mackenzie Spencer Allen...

21:13.271 --> 21:15.006
I, Mackenzie S. Allen…

21:15.073 --> 21:17.042
...do solemnly swear...

21:17.108 --> 21:19.044
...do solemnly swear…

21:19.110 --> 21:21.246
…that I will faithfully
execute the office

21:21.313 --> 21:23.281
of president of the United States.

21:23.348 --> 21:25.517
…that I will faithfully
execute the office

21:25.584 --> 21:27.919
of president of the United States.

21:30.655 --> 21:35.227
[man 1] This is an electrifying
and historic moment, Mackenzie Allen…

21:35.293 --> 21:38.563
[woman] She was wearing a navy
sleeveless suit when she took the...

21:38.630 --> 21:41.733
[man 2] The late president's condition
was kept from the nation

21:41.800 --> 21:43.101
up until two hours ago…

21:43.168 --> 21:46.438
[man 3] Allen was sworn in in a
private ceremony just a few hours ago…

21:46.505 --> 21:48.840
[woman] ...the first female
in the Oval Office,

21:48.907 --> 21:52.010
but indeed the first Independent
president to take the office.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.446
Madam President,
both staffs have assembled.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.648
Kelly, we have
the Roosevelt ready for you.

21:56.715 --> 21:59.451
The DOD and Protocol
are making funeral arrangements.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.820
I reviewed the NSC report this morning.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.388
Not much to worry about. Sir.

22:03.455 --> 22:07.125
Kelly we have everything ready
for you in here. Coffee?

22:08.426 --> 22:11.329
- Morning.
- Morning. Madam President.

22:11.396 --> 22:14.366
Just make sure that everybody...

22:14.432 --> 22:17.102
[talking continues]

22:27.812 --> 22:32.517
[Jim] I, um... I haven't had time
to type up my letter of resignation yet.

22:32.584 --> 22:35.120
But it is forthcoming.
Meanwhile, anything I can...

22:35.186 --> 22:38.990
Listen, you've...
You've done a damn good job here.

22:39.057 --> 22:41.560
We're gonna need you
during the transition phase.

22:41.626 --> 22:45.297
I was hoping that you could help us
set up meetings with the dignitaries.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.332
- You should sit in.
- Whatever you need.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.234
I've assembled the cabinet for you.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.469
OK. Give me ten minutes.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.538
I'll see you in ten minutes.

22:58.276 --> 23:01.413
- How do you feel?
- Sad.

23:02.047 --> 23:05.350
Yeah. I know.

23:05.417 --> 23:06.818
Hmm.

23:06.885 --> 23:10.221
The truth is, I know I can do this.

23:10.288 --> 23:11.623
Yes, you can.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.959
That doesn't mean I'm prepared.

23:14.025 --> 23:16.428
I was never on the inside.

23:16.494 --> 23:18.330
I wasn't Gore. I wasn't Cheney.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.833
OK, that's right.
You're not one of those guys.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.837
You're Mackenzie Allen. You're
the president of the United States.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.173
You represent
this nation's strength, OK?

23:28.239 --> 23:31.876
And that's how we have
to go into that cabinet meeting.

23:31.943 --> 23:36.047
You talk about... about solidarity,
about President Bridges,

23:36.114 --> 23:39.384
about how he would have wanted
to have kept the administration,

23:39.451 --> 23:41.186
you know, together.

23:41.252 --> 23:42.654
- [knocking]
- Come on in.

23:42.721 --> 23:45.223
- And let's keep it on track.
- Madam President?

23:49.628 --> 23:52.764
I can clear the desk off for you
when you're not here.

23:54.599 --> 23:55.634
Thank you, Ruth.

23:56.635 --> 24:00.505
Sir, you are to meet with Nora Woodruff
in the Vermeil in ten.

24:00.572 --> 24:03.408
- Who's Nora Woodruff?
- The first lady's chief of staff.

24:03.475 --> 24:05.844
That can wait.
I've got to see the president...

24:05.910 --> 24:07.646
You know, I'm OK, Rod.

24:08.680 --> 24:09.714
You sure?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.988
Sir, you can use that door to get...

24:17.055 --> 24:18.723
Thank you, Ruth.

24:22.260 --> 24:25.764
Ruth, I would like to talk
to you later about staying,

24:25.830 --> 24:27.332
integrating my staff with...

24:27.399 --> 24:30.268
I would understand if you
wanted to bring Ms. Rogers over.

24:30.335 --> 24:32.937
She should stay
in the vice president's office.

24:33.004 --> 24:34.773
I'd like you here, if you don't mind.

24:34.839 --> 24:36.207
Well, ma'am...

24:36.274 --> 24:38.910
...yes, I do.

24:39.778 --> 24:40.845
Oh.

24:40.912 --> 24:43.481
I don't mean to apply
any more pressure to you.

24:43.548 --> 24:44.949
It must be...

24:45.016 --> 24:48.219
My God, I can't imagine
what it must be like for you.

24:48.286 --> 24:52.023
But I have been with him
for more than a decade.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.893
And I know that he did not want
you behind that desk. And so…

24:54.959 --> 24:59.164
Why don't you give it a few days,
Ruth? See, you know, how it goes.

24:59.964 --> 25:01.366
I wish you success, ma'am.

25:02.233 --> 25:04.803
I really do.
Because I wish this country success.

25:04.869 --> 25:07.038
But... staying here,

25:07.105 --> 25:10.141
it would just make me feel…

25:11.810 --> 25:14.846
- Say it, whatever it is.
- It would make me feel cheap.

25:17.048 --> 25:19.984
You're gonna put the time in
to training Ms. Rogers?

25:20.051 --> 25:21.786
- Of course.
- Great.

25:21.853 --> 25:25.390
Would you set some time aside for
calls to Congressional leaders for me?

25:25.457 --> 25:27.859
- Of course, ma'am.
- Thank you.

25:53.318 --> 25:54.986
- Soon enough.
- What?

25:55.053 --> 25:57.188
Your painting will be up there
soon enough.

25:57.255 --> 26:00.458
I'm Nora Woodruff.
I run the first lady's staff.

26:00.525 --> 26:03.027
- And also the Office of Protocol.
- Oh.

26:03.094 --> 26:05.363
It's just awful about the president.
Isn't it?

26:05.430 --> 26:07.732
But the first lady came to me...

26:07.799 --> 26:09.734
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bridges came to me,

26:09.801 --> 26:12.070
and she told me that
the nation needs to move on

26:12.137 --> 26:14.172
and that I should get
with you right away.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.441
- Good.
- May I show you to your office?

26:16.508 --> 26:19.444
- Uh...
- This way.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.246
[indistinct chatter]

26:21.312 --> 26:22.847
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:22.914 --> 26:25.784
- the president of the United States.
- Good morning.

26:26.551 --> 26:28.153
Please, take your seats.

26:28.219 --> 26:30.321
Ma'am, you need to look at this.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.029
I'm sorry, uh, I'd like
this meeting to be closed

26:38.096 --> 26:40.965
to everyone but cabinet members.

26:44.235 --> 26:47.772
- General, if you would please stay.
- Yes, ma'am.

26:55.346 --> 26:58.383
It seems that our
secretary of labor has resigned.

26:58.449 --> 27:00.218
Effective immediately.

27:01.219 --> 27:03.888
Is there anyone else?

27:04.455 --> 27:05.456
Anyone?

27:06.658 --> 27:07.659
I'm here.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.163
I can accept resignations,
live and in person.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.404
We all have something in common.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.439
That's President Teddy Bridges.

27:21.506 --> 27:26.144
He picked all of us
to be a team. All of us.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.948
Now we can remain a team.
But it's up to you.

27:30.014 --> 27:32.317
Because I do not intend
to make any changes.

27:33.551 --> 27:35.053
So I ask again,

27:35.119 --> 27:38.122
and please, follow the courage
of your convictions.

27:39.324 --> 27:42.427
If you want out, you tell me now.

27:46.231 --> 27:47.232
OK.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.834
Oh. It's, uh...

27:51.135 --> 27:53.137
...very, uh, pink.

27:54.239 --> 27:56.274
- Yes.
- Mm-hm.

27:56.341 --> 28:00.278
Well, Mrs. Clinton
had her office in the West Wing.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.680
That didn't go over very well.

28:02.747 --> 28:06.718
I think staying here like a traditional
first lady is a splendid idea.

28:06.784 --> 28:09.254
Well, this'll...
This'll be fine, I suppose.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.388
Good.

28:10.455 --> 28:13.825
After the funeral we'll discuss
what kind of staff you'll be needing.

28:13.892 --> 28:16.127
Do you think it'll be more than 20?

28:16.194 --> 28:19.397
Mrs. Clinton had 20.

28:19.464 --> 28:21.399
That didn't go over very well.

28:21.466 --> 28:25.103
Folks on the Hill thought it was,
you know, a waste of tax dollars.

28:25.169 --> 28:29.240
I think that we should maybe wait until
the president has delivered her speech.

28:29.307 --> 28:32.310
Oh, is she giving a speech?

28:32.377 --> 28:34.779
Yes, uh, to the Congress.

28:34.846 --> 28:37.248
- We're working on it, so...
- Really?

28:37.315 --> 28:40.585
Are you going to be involving
yourself in matters like that?

28:41.920 --> 28:45.490
I need to see the Nigerian ambassador
with the JCS.

28:45.556 --> 28:47.926
- When? Today?
- Today. As soon as possible.

28:47.992 --> 28:49.294
The Nigerians need to know

28:49.360 --> 28:52.330
that I continue to take the release
of Oria Madula seriously.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.533
That this was not some “go away”
mission for the vice president.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.536
Oh, I asked the Army
chief of staff a few weeks ago

28:58.603 --> 29:00.638
to work up an extraction plan
for Madula.

29:00.705 --> 29:02.840
I'd like to see that.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.276
- OK?
- Done.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.012
[sighs]

29:08.079 --> 29:09.914
Are you OK?

29:09.981 --> 29:11.649
Yeah.

29:12.884 --> 29:15.920
What I said in there,
that applies to you as well.

29:16.788 --> 29:17.855
I don't follow.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.591
I want you to be my chief of staff.

29:23.127 --> 29:25.563
I know. It's the last thing
you expected to hear.

29:25.630 --> 29:29.467
But you've run this place for over
two years. You know what you're doing.

29:30.702 --> 29:33.571
These are emotional times for all of us.

29:34.405 --> 29:35.873
I need your wisdom.

29:37.875 --> 29:39.410
I know we don't agree on a lot,

29:39.477 --> 29:43.948
but... I promise you,
I will listen to you.

29:45.483 --> 29:48.353
This is... rather unexpected.

29:48.419 --> 29:50.488
[exhales] What isn't these days?

29:50.555 --> 29:53.591
Have you talked to your husband
about this? What does Rod...?

29:53.658 --> 29:56.027
Um, I'll find the appropriate time
to tell him.

29:56.094 --> 29:57.595
Do you want me to talk to him?

29:57.662 --> 30:00.298
Oh, God, no. No. You can't imagine...

30:00.365 --> 30:03.434
Um... No. He'll be disappointed.

30:03.501 --> 30:06.404
But, uh, he knows that,
as the first female president,

30:06.471 --> 30:10.274
I can't have it seem like
my husband is running the country.

30:11.342 --> 30:14.479
I'm sure he's gonna have
his hands full with his new duties.

30:14.545 --> 30:17.815
[Nora] Attention, everyone,
can you stop the work for a moment.

30:17.882 --> 30:21.119
Just wanna make some introductions.
This is Mark. He's our primary.

30:21.185 --> 30:22.854
- Hi, Mark.
- It's a pleasure, sir.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.523
Mark, I'm sure you have a lot
of questions for FLOTUS.

30:25.590 --> 30:28.426
- First gentleman.
- So sad about the president.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.927
Yes, very.

30:29.994 --> 30:33.731
I assume we will be meeting daily
to discuss the menu?

30:33.798 --> 30:36.167
Uh, well, uh, that's not
really my style, Mark.

30:36.234 --> 30:39.237
Actually, the first lady does
have quite a bit of involvement

30:39.303 --> 30:41.139
in the meal preparation.

30:41.205 --> 30:43.841
There was Mrs. Clinton,
of course, she shunned that,

30:43.908 --> 30:45.977
made the staff guess.
Didn't go over well.

30:46.044 --> 30:48.913
Tonight, um, before the speech,
something light perhaps.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.482
- A salad, I suppose.
- That'd be fine.

30:51.549 --> 30:55.386
And what salad dressing
does the president prefer?

30:55.453 --> 30:57.555
[sighs] Man.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.127
Hello, Mac.

31:04.062 --> 31:07.732
Grace. I'm so sorry.

31:09.434 --> 31:13.171
He was gorging on the
great generals of World War II.

31:15.973 --> 31:17.375
[exhales]

31:17.975 --> 31:21.345
It happened just... like that.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.683
He was going to ask you to resign.

31:27.018 --> 31:28.453
He did.

31:30.621 --> 31:32.457
And yet, here you stand,

31:32.523 --> 31:35.426
ready to address the nation
in 90 minutes as its president.

31:39.230 --> 31:43.000
Well, I hope it's the best damn speech
those little bastards ever heard.

31:47.004 --> 31:49.907
You honor him, Mac.
Honor him well.

31:49.974 --> 31:51.375
You bet I will.

31:54.312 --> 31:58.616
So, what happens now?
I guess I move out, right?

32:02.453 --> 32:05.990
You know, we've never
actually owned a home.

32:06.057 --> 32:07.758
Hmm.

32:07.825 --> 32:11.028
We moved into the governor's mansion
when he was 30.

32:11.095 --> 32:14.999
We were there for 16 years. Then
the Observatory for four and now here.

32:16.434 --> 32:20.104
Hmm. Well, you take
all the time you need.

32:20.171 --> 32:21.839
Obviously, you and Tommy.

32:23.474 --> 32:27.078
Mac, you're the first female president.

32:27.145 --> 32:30.848
If Moses had been a woman,
leading the Jews in the desert,

32:30.915 --> 32:33.251
she'd have stopped
and asked for directions.

32:33.317 --> 32:36.420
They'd have been in Israel in a week.

32:37.688 --> 32:39.924
- Manute.
- Madam President.

32:39.991 --> 32:41.325
- Jim.
- Manute.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.861
Allow me to express
our sincere condolences.

32:43.928 --> 32:46.664
Thank you. I don't have much time.

32:46.731 --> 32:50.368
We must continue to insist
that the United States does not...

32:50.434 --> 32:52.036
...interfere...

32:52.103 --> 32:53.704
Sorry, what was that?

32:56.440 --> 32:58.042
Gentlemen.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.845
- General Pollack.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:00.912 --> 33:04.849
Explain to the ambassador the means
by which we will extricate Oria Madula.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.050
Yes, ma'am.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.319
Last night, on President Allen's orders,

33:08.386 --> 33:10.321
we moved the USS Tarawa.

33:10.388 --> 33:13.624
She's the flagship of the
Amphibious Readiness Group.

33:13.691 --> 33:16.527
In half an hour we'll be able
to send an advance team

33:16.594 --> 33:19.030
of six Cobras to soften your defenses,

33:19.096 --> 33:22.533
which will be followed
by a Huey command helicopter.

33:22.600 --> 33:26.337
After that, we will
send in two CH-46 helicopters

33:26.404 --> 33:28.406
with an extraction team.

33:28.472 --> 33:33.110
We'll remove Oria Madula
and fly her to free soil.

33:34.011 --> 33:37.648
By the way,
we're pretty good at this sort of thing.

33:37.715 --> 33:40.618
There should be... limited loss of life.

33:43.321 --> 33:47.225
I don't believe the USA
would take such unilateral action.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.162
You're a good guy. You really are.

33:51.229 --> 33:53.864
But I can't take a chance
that my becoming president

33:53.931 --> 33:56.000
will speed Oria Madula's execution.

33:57.235 --> 33:59.804
And if you think
that I am gonna stand by

33:59.870 --> 34:02.306
and watch a young woman be executed,

34:02.373 --> 34:06.811
tortured, for having sex,
you are sorely mistaken.

34:12.917 --> 34:14.652
I will call the prime minister.

34:25.463 --> 34:28.699
All right.
I'll tell you what I resent, OK?

34:28.766 --> 34:29.867
OK.

34:30.768 --> 34:34.505
I, uh, resent that...
you knew this all along,

34:34.572 --> 34:36.540
- and that you let me...
- No...

34:36.607 --> 34:38.743
No, no let me finish.

34:38.809 --> 34:40.610
That you were gonna do this all along

34:40.678 --> 34:44.547
and you let me behave
like an ass in front of Jim.

34:44.614 --> 34:48.018
I mean, thanking him
for his service to this country.

34:50.554 --> 34:51.989
I'm so humiliated.

34:52.922 --> 34:55.126
- Rod, come on. You don't...
- "Come on"?

34:55.192 --> 34:56.860
Honey, honey. Listen. Listen.

34:56.927 --> 35:01.165
The only way this has ever worked
is when we've walked side by side.

35:01.232 --> 35:04.302
- And I want to be there for you.
- You will be.

35:04.368 --> 35:06.404
As chief of staff.

35:06.470 --> 35:10.007
You are the most important man
in my life. I swear to you…

35:10.074 --> 35:13.311
It's OK. It's OK.

35:13.377 --> 35:16.147
We gotta go. We do.

35:21.252 --> 35:23.154
[rock music on TV]

35:23.220 --> 35:25.022
Hey.

35:25.089 --> 35:29.060
- We're leaving in, like, ten minutes.
- Yeah, I know. Uh... I'm not going.

35:29.927 --> 35:32.563
- You're joking, right?
- No, I'm not feeling well.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.865
What are you doing?

35:34.932 --> 35:37.568
I just told you, OK?
I'm not feeling well.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.503
- [mutes TV]
- Hey.

35:39.570 --> 35:42.873
Look, I know girls and their moms
are supposed to have their troubles.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.942
If you don't go, you guys won't recover.

35:45.009 --> 35:46.277
- You know what?
- What?

35:46.344 --> 35:48.145
I just don't wanna go, OK?

35:48.212 --> 35:51.349
Mom says not to be a hypocrite.
All right. Fine. I won't be.

35:51.415 --> 35:54.585
Hey, look. You get to be
John-John and I'll be Patti Davis.

35:56.187 --> 35:59.090
If you don't come,
that's all that‘s gonna be on her mind.

35:59.156 --> 36:01.525
Do you want to be responsible for that?

36:01.592 --> 36:03.928
Have a sense of history.

36:05.930 --> 36:09.233
[departing footsteps, door closes]

36:09.300 --> 36:12.103
[sirens wail]

36:13.471 --> 36:16.907
[Mac] The word “legacy”
would work better than “foundation.”

36:16.974 --> 36:18.976
- I don't see why not.
- [telephone rings]

36:22.446 --> 36:24.582
- [girl] Mommy? When you were young,
- Yeah?

36:24.648 --> 36:26.484
did you ever get a time out?

36:26.550 --> 36:28.986
Only about a hundred million times.

36:29.053 --> 36:30.788
OK, that's real good.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.257
- We've got Kharkov scheduled.
- OK, good.

36:33.324 --> 36:37.094
- What'd you get a time out for?
- Honey, Mommy's got to concentrate now.

36:37.161 --> 36:40.398
- She's got an important speech to give.
- Interrupting my parents.

36:41.365 --> 36:43.467
- Amy! Dammit!
- Sorry.

36:44.668 --> 36:47.304
- Here. Here.
- I'm sorry.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.140
You have got to be much more careful.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.342
- [Amy] I didn't mean it.
- It's OK, baby.

36:53.110 --> 36:54.445
[Rod] Unbelievable.

36:54.512 --> 36:57.481
Did you get wet too? It's all right.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.850
[Rod] No. You're not
gonna be able to wear that.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.852
Ma'am.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.589
- Wear this.
- [Mac] Yes.

37:05.656 --> 37:08.459
- [Mac] Thank you.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.916

from President Allen's first…

37:31.982 --> 37:35.386
[speakers in various languages]

37:35.453 --> 37:37.021
Ready, ma'am.

37:38.556 --> 37:40.858
Go to Kelly, baby.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.726
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi, sweetie.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.295
[Rod] Mackenzie.

37:44.361 --> 37:46.530
- So, do you hate me?
- No.

37:47.264 --> 37:48.399
I love you.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.504
Go win the country.

37:54.905 --> 37:56.307
[Mac chuckles]

38:07.084 --> 38:11.689
Mr. Speaker,
the president of the United States!

38:52.429 --> 38:54.632
Ladies and Gentleman of this Congress,

38:54.698 --> 38:58.769
honorable justices of the Supreme Court,
members of my cabinet,

38:58.836 --> 39:01.872
distinguished guests,
to the American people

39:01.939 --> 39:04.775
and to our friends around
the world who are watching now:

39:04.842 --> 39:08.279
Let me offer the clarity
of my conviction.

39:08.345 --> 39:09.980
The White House…

39:29.433 --> 39:32.903
The White House
was where President Bridges lived,

39:32.970 --> 39:35.839
but it was not his home,
nor is it my home now.

39:35.906 --> 39:38.842
It is the home of the presidency.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.811
The home of American democracy.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.949
And though President Bridges'
agenda must be respected,

39:45.015 --> 39:49.653
my task is not
to fulfill the legacy of a man.

39:49.720 --> 39:54.158
I have been entrusted
with continuing the legacy of a nation,

39:54.224 --> 39:56.527
and what is best in it.

39:56.594 --> 39:59.630
A nation whose magnificent
and righteous history

39:59.697 --> 40:01.665
will govern its future.

40:03.167 --> 40:06.270
A cloud hangs over us.
It's a cloud of mourning,

40:06.337 --> 40:07.905
of uncertainty.

40:07.972 --> 40:11.041
And though that cloud
may cover the sun temporarily,

40:11.108 --> 40:13.377
it cannot extinguish it.

40:13.444 --> 40:18.349
That sun,
like our freedom and democracy,

40:18.415 --> 40:20.417
will not go away.

40:20.484 --> 40:25.022
Resilience is what
defines our character.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.725
And the character
of any nation is judged

40:27.791 --> 40:30.861
not by its leaders, but by its people.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.931
The people, like that sun,

40:33.998 --> 40:35.933
are what is constant.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.503
And so I say
to the people of this nation,

40:39.570 --> 40:42.940
I am humbled by your greatness.

40:43.007 --> 40:45.509
I am humbled by the history
being made here today,

40:45.576 --> 40:48.112
humbled by the notion

40:48.178 --> 40:51.682
that I am the first woman
to hold this office.

40:51.749 --> 40:56.320
I'm humbled by the
responsibilities that rest with me.

40:57.421 --> 41:00.658
I promise to vigorously
defend our Constitution.

41:01.358 --> 41:03.994
I will recognize, as Harry Truman said,

41:04.061 --> 41:07.097
that the responsibility of a great state

41:07.164 --> 41:10.701
is to serve the world,
not to dominate it.

41:10.768 --> 41:13.671
And it is clear that
human rights is not an issue

41:13.737 --> 41:18.942
for just the free world,
but it is, nonetheless,

41:19.009 --> 41:22.513
the responsibility of a free people.

41:24.748 --> 41:27.951
God knows you and I have
shed tears these past days.

41:28.018 --> 41:31.722
And more tears are to come.

41:31.789 --> 41:34.425
But soon, we must return to the future.

41:34.491 --> 41:37.561
And I will do my best to take you there.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.431
I am with you.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.035
I ask this Congress,

41:45.769 --> 41:48.706
I ask the Court, I ask my cabinet,

41:48.772 --> 41:53.777
I ask the people of the United States
to stand with me now, unwavering.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.280
For in this house united,

41:56.346 --> 41:59.583
we will demonstrate
our sovereignty of greatness.

42:02.252 --> 42:04.321
God bless Theodore Roosevelt Bridges.

42:04.388 --> 42:08.892
May his soul rest...
with the greatest of men.

42:09.860 --> 42:13.430
And God bless the
United States of America. Thank you.

42:27.945 --> 42:29.413
Whoo!

42:32.416 --> 42:34.585
I'll always be right behind you.
