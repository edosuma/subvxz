Announcer:
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.106 --> 00:04.075
‐ Crawfish.
‐ ( exhales sharply )

00:04.075 --> 00:05.410
You gotta work quick, guys.

00:05.410 --> 00:08.951
<i>...a Gordon Ramsay</i>
<i>skills test left Jenny...</i>

00:08.951 --> 00:10.655
‐ Ouch!
‐ ... <i>In a pinch...</i>

00:10.655 --> 00:13.493
What happened there?
That's really murky.

00:13.493 --> 00:18.103
<i>...ending her time</i>
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

00:18.103 --> 00:20.040
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:20.040 --> 00:24.482
Two world‐renowned chefs
are gonna cook alongside you.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.452
‐ <i>...the home cooks...</i>
‐ Please welcome...

00:26.452 --> 00:29.325
‐ <i>...meet their match.</i>
‐ We're completely screwed.

00:29.325 --> 00:32.131
‐ <i>And when the top ten</i>
<i>pair up...</i>
‐ Whoo.

00:32.131 --> 00:35.905
‐ <i>...teammates become enemies.</i>
‐ I don't like these blobs.
Very distasteful.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.642
( bleep ) I got this.
Don't worry about this.

00:37.642 --> 00:39.746
<i>Leading to a performance</i>
<i>so shocking...</i>

00:39.746 --> 00:41.984
‐ Christina:
That's embarrassing.
‐ <i>...two...</i>

00:41.984 --> 00:43.821
‐ It's kind of boring.
‐ <i>...could be going home.</i>

00:43.821 --> 00:45.324
Disgusting.

00:55.344 --> 00:57.749
‐ Christina: <i>All right.</i>
‐ Gordon: <i>Welcome back.</i>

00:57.749 --> 00:59.018
‐ Whoo!
‐ Yes, yes.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.855
‐ Line up, please.
‐ Top ten.

01:00.855 --> 01:04.796
I'm part of the top ten.
I've had a target on my back
since the beginning.

01:04.796 --> 01:08.169
There's a lot of people
that certainly don't believe
that I should be here.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.476
<i>Maybe I've ruffled</i>
<i>a few feathers along the way,</i>
<i>but I'm here to win.</i>

01:11.476 --> 01:15.718
And I can become
America's next MasterChef.

01:15.718 --> 01:18.891
Let's be honest.
We all know that a team
challenge can bring out the best

01:18.891 --> 01:21.262
<i>or worst in people, right?</i>

01:21.262 --> 01:26.607
‐ All: Yes, Chef.
‐ Well, tonight we are putting
your fate in your own hands.

01:26.607 --> 01:31.950
‐ Oh.
‐ Because you will be working
in pairs of your own choosing.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.055
( laughter )

01:34.055 --> 01:35.692
‐ Knew it!
‐ Oh, my God.

01:35.692 --> 01:38.196
On the count of three,
I want you to find that partner.

01:38.196 --> 01:40.367
One, two, three.

01:41.870 --> 01:43.941
I'm looking around the room
and I'm looking at people

01:43.941 --> 01:46.446
and I'm like,
"Okay, I'm gonna stand here.

01:46.446 --> 01:47.882
Let's wait and see
who chooses me."

01:47.882 --> 01:51.155
‐ I'm not moving.
‐ And then Cate chooses me.

01:51.155 --> 01:53.159
She's like brushing my arm,
tugging me over,

01:53.159 --> 01:57.602
and I'm like, I'm happy.
Cate's won a couple of times.
This is awesomesauce.

01:57.602 --> 01:59.405
‐ Do you want
to be my partner? Okay.
‐ Yes.

01:59.405 --> 02:00.908
A lot of people
were getting taken.

02:00.908 --> 02:02.344
I'm seeing Jeff over there
standing by himself.

02:02.344 --> 02:04.716
‐ Right here.
‐ All right, let's do this.

02:04.716 --> 02:06.385
Jeff was probably
my last choice.

02:06.385 --> 02:09.860
But us together, there's a huge
opportunity to win.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.597
‐ Dino and Jeff.
‐ ( laughter )

02:11.597 --> 02:14.435
Opposites attract, I guess.
I don't know.

02:14.435 --> 02:18.577
We're either going
to be very successful
or completely screwed.

02:18.577 --> 02:20.413
Since you're working
in teams of two,

02:20.413 --> 02:22.952
<i>we thought it would</i>
<i>be appropriate for you</i>
<i>to work</i>

02:22.952 --> 02:28.631
with two of the most versatile
and popular ingredients
in the entire world.

02:28.631 --> 02:31.402
‐ Chicken.
‐ Ahh!

02:31.402 --> 02:33.908
And... potatoes.

02:33.908 --> 02:36.245
‐ Yes.
‐ I love chicken
and potatoes.

02:36.245 --> 02:38.349
<i>But they are so common,</i>

02:38.349 --> 02:40.588
<i>you have to really think</i>
<i>about how to elevate that.</i>

02:40.588 --> 02:43.259
<i>I'm really looking</i>
<i>to Gabriel's youthful ideas</i>

02:43.259 --> 02:47.301
to help take
this old lady's flavor palette
up a little bit higher.

02:47.301 --> 02:50.440
And in this challenge,
there's even more a stake, guys.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.444
Tonight's winning dish
will be featured

02:52.444 --> 02:55.150
‐ in "Family Circle"
magazine.
‐ Wow.

02:55.150 --> 02:57.454
Aarón:
<i>"Family Circle"</i>
<i>is America's best‐selling</i>

02:57.454 --> 03:02.064
food and family magazine,
reaching more than 16 million
readers each month.

03:02.064 --> 03:04.001
Christina:
<i>The winning team's dish</i>
<i>will be featured</i>

03:04.001 --> 03:07.007
in "Family Circle's"
October issue.

03:07.007 --> 03:09.646
And both home cooks
on tonight's winning team

03:09.646 --> 03:11.349
will receive a five year
subscription

03:11.349 --> 03:12.451
to "Family Circle"
magazine.

03:12.451 --> 03:14.789
‐ Oh, wow.
‐ That's awesome.

03:14.789 --> 03:18.329
There's one last thing.

03:18.329 --> 03:21.703
Tonight, two
world‐renowned chefs

03:21.703 --> 03:24.108
are gonna cook
as a team alongside you.

03:24.108 --> 03:26.813
‐ Oh!
‐ What?

03:26.813 --> 03:30.655
Two award‐winning chefs
that are so in demand,

03:30.655 --> 03:33.694
I personally phoned them
and begged them

03:33.694 --> 03:35.196
to join us
in the MasterChef
kitchen tonight.

03:35.196 --> 03:39.673
‐ Oh.
‐ Please turn around
and welcome...

03:39.673 --> 03:43.012
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Who is it? I'm so nervous.
I'm so excited.

03:47.154 --> 03:50.493
Gordon:
<i>Aarón Sánchez</i>
<i>and Christina Tosi.</i>

03:50.493 --> 03:52.665
( laughter, applause )

03:52.665 --> 03:55.437
( cheering )

03:55.437 --> 03:58.209
I'm so happy it's Chef Christina
and Chef Aarón.

03:58.209 --> 04:02.284
The fact that they
will be cooking alongside us
in the MasterChef kitchen

04:02.284 --> 04:05.023
is great motivation
to get our game together

04:05.023 --> 04:06.693
and step it up
to the next level.

04:06.693 --> 04:08.697
‐ You're going down.
‐ ( laughter )

04:10.801 --> 04:12.337
‐ Wow.
‐ Right, all of you,

04:12.337 --> 04:15.978
you'll have 60 minutes
to make us one stunning

04:15.978 --> 04:18.851
restaurant‐worthy
chicken and potato dish.

04:18.851 --> 04:21.723
Your 60 minutes starts now.

04:21.723 --> 04:24.662
‐ ( screaming, laughter )
‐ There you go, Jason.

04:24.662 --> 04:27.200
‐ Go, Gabe, go, go, go.
‐ All right, so what are we
gonna do?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.171
So I'm thinking we make
a beautiful filling.

04:29.171 --> 04:31.008
‐ Definitely some chicken stock.
‐ Absolutely.

04:31.008 --> 04:33.346
What are you thinking
with the potatoes? French fries?

04:33.346 --> 04:35.551
‐ Puree? No, We can't
do French fries.
‐ Come on now.

04:35.551 --> 04:38.524
‐ That's not elevated.
‐ Ooh, kimchee.

04:38.524 --> 04:40.895
Caitlin and I have pretty
different flavor palettes,

04:40.895 --> 04:44.602
and I'm worried about having
both of our voices heard
on that dish.

04:44.602 --> 04:46.773
I really want to make
that chicken karaage.

04:46.773 --> 04:48.977
<i>We just need to figure out</i>
<i>how to combine</i>

04:48.977 --> 04:51.215
the Japanese flavors
that I want to do

04:51.215 --> 04:53.152
and Caitlin's Pittsburgh
background.

04:53.152 --> 04:55.223
‐ Well done.
‐ Let's go, let's go.

04:55.223 --> 04:57.327
‐ 55 minutes remaining.
‐ Ugh.

04:57.327 --> 05:02.237
Gordon:
Now stop the clock.

05:02.237 --> 05:04.374
One more small detail
that you should all know.

05:04.374 --> 05:06.513
Uh‐oh.

05:06.513 --> 05:09.686
When your 60 minutes are up,
one losing team

05:09.686 --> 05:13.192
<i>will go head‐to‐head</i>
<i>in an extremely difficult</i>
<i>pressure test.</i>

05:13.192 --> 05:14.762
Oh!

05:14.762 --> 05:20.039
Take a long, hard look
at your teammate

05:20.039 --> 05:23.614
because that person who begins
the night as your ally

05:23.614 --> 05:28.557
could quickly become
your enemy tonight.

05:28.557 --> 05:32.899
55 minutes remaining, guys.
Your time starts now.

05:32.899 --> 05:33.901
‐ There you go.
‐ All right.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.806
You get started
on that stock.

05:36.806 --> 05:38.610
And so you're not starting?

05:38.610 --> 05:40.581
‐ Nope, not at all.
‐ I think we have a solid plan.

05:40.581 --> 05:43.654
And to be honest,
we don't need 60 minutes.
30 minutes in, boom.

05:43.654 --> 05:45.591
Press this down and get as much
skin on there as possible.

05:45.591 --> 05:47.795
I know how
to cook chicken, baby.

05:47.795 --> 05:49.498
Gordon:
<i>60 minutes,</i>
<i>chicken and potatoes.</i>

05:49.498 --> 05:52.304
Let's go look at the first team,
Gabriel and Yachecia.

05:52.304 --> 05:55.544
The youngest and the oldest
home cook in this kitchen.

05:55.544 --> 05:57.113
<i>They both have</i>
<i>a calm about them.</i>

05:57.113 --> 05:59.619
They're both relatively
low‐to‐no drama.

05:59.619 --> 06:01.756
<i>I think they're both</i>
<i>ideal teammates.</i>

06:01.756 --> 06:04.261
It's got, like,
a nice pea essence to it.

06:04.261 --> 06:05.564
‐ You like?
‐ Yes.

06:05.564 --> 06:07.467
Gordon:
Now Caitlin and Adam.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.240
I think they're gonna have
two different ideas in the
concept of the dish.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.845
She's a great student,
he's not necessarily
a great student.

06:12.845 --> 06:16.418
‐ He gets over‐confident.
‐ Do you want to start clearing
a spot for the deep fryer?

06:16.418 --> 06:17.922
‐ I'll do it in the wok.
‐ You're not gonna use
the deep fryer?

06:17.922 --> 06:19.091
Yeah.
I do it in the wok.

06:19.091 --> 06:21.161
Okay, and you do this
all the time at home?

06:21.161 --> 06:22.464
‐ Yeah, all the time.
‐ Okay.

06:22.464 --> 06:24.434
I mean, how about
Jason and Daniel?

06:24.434 --> 06:28.309
Jason's culinary perspective,
the way he thinks about food
and shapes the dish,

06:28.309 --> 06:30.948
is gonna be pretty dominant
compared to Daniel's,

06:30.948 --> 06:33.286
and I worry that Daniel's
gonna take a little bit
too much of a backseat.

06:33.286 --> 06:37.160
‐ I'm putting just a little
shaoxing, just a little bit.
‐ Yeah.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.366
Cate and Eboni, Team Chicago
is definitely in the house.

06:40.366 --> 06:44.474
Two strong ladies,
the both have particular
perspectives with food.

06:44.474 --> 06:47.648
I think they have the potential
of butting heads big time.

06:47.648 --> 06:50.186
Salt and
a little bit of dill.
Cook that down.

06:50.186 --> 06:51.856
I'm gonna pour the broth
in there, get it going,
and then I'm gonna‐‐

06:51.856 --> 06:53.994
‐ Take the dill out.
‐ Take it‐‐ no,
it's gonna taste good.

06:53.994 --> 06:58.870
Now the most bizarre
team pairing tonight,
Jeff and Dino.

06:58.870 --> 07:02.878
A disaster. I can't think
of an oil and water scenario
more than these two.

07:02.878 --> 07:05.884
‐ We need to garnish it
with this.
‐ I don't think so.

07:08.289 --> 07:11.028
I'm working on that pesto.
I need you to taste this

07:11.028 --> 07:13.332
so you can tell me
if it's the best‐o.

07:13.332 --> 07:16.004
Gordon:
40 minutes remaining.

07:16.004 --> 07:17.808
Today we're doing a roulade
of the chicken thigh,

07:17.808 --> 07:20.748
a cold snap pea coulis,
and then we're gonna do
a little potato gratin.

07:20.748 --> 07:22.417
Then we're gonna finish off
with a little bit
of microgreens,

07:22.417 --> 07:25.022
crispy chicken skin.
I think we're good together.

07:25.022 --> 07:26.893
We both communicate very well.
We're both good voices
in the kitchen,

07:26.893 --> 07:29.164
so I think this is
a really good dynamic.

07:29.164 --> 07:33.038
The old with the young,
the old can teach the young,
the young can teach the old.

07:33.038 --> 07:36.579
Today we are making
a pan‐seared chicken thigh

07:36.579 --> 07:39.050
with some sautéed mushrooms,
and a little bit of cream,

07:39.050 --> 07:41.422
paired with a gratin
of the potato.

07:41.422 --> 07:43.259
I think we have
delicious items
on the plate.

07:43.259 --> 07:45.864
We just need to make sure
that everything comes together
at the right time.

07:45.864 --> 07:49.037
Cut a little bit off,
but make sure you leave enough
so it's crispy.

07:49.037 --> 07:51.709
All right.
Team Chicago.

07:51.709 --> 07:53.078
How is this dish
coming together?

07:53.078 --> 07:55.416
We're doing a French chicken
leg, an apple puree,

07:55.416 --> 07:59.491
fondant potatoes, and crispy
pancetta as a garnish.

07:59.491 --> 08:01.395
Now if the dish
doesn't go well tonight?

08:01.395 --> 08:03.834
Cate knows she gotta go home.
I'm gonna have to kick her ass.
Sorry.

08:03.834 --> 08:05.436
Really? I thought
you guys were friends.

08:05.436 --> 08:07.006
We are, but you know,
we're competitive.

08:07.006 --> 08:09.344
We're working well together,
and we're gonna work our ass off

08:09.344 --> 08:10.614
so that we don't have to go
up against each other.

08:10.614 --> 08:12.852
‐ Exactly.
‐ I love it. Good luck.

08:15.691 --> 08:18.262
Right. Dino, tell me
about the dish, please.
What are we doing?

08:18.262 --> 08:21.870
We are doing a chicken leg
pine‐crusted lollipop

08:21.870 --> 08:24.809
with a cremini mushroom pesto.
It's sort of a Sicilian thing.

08:24.809 --> 08:27.882
Well, that's not just it.
We're gonna do a nice
potato cannelloni

08:27.882 --> 08:30.721
that's gonna be stuffed
with a chicken potato
and cheese mousse.

08:30.721 --> 08:32.625
Cremini mushroom pesto,
cheese mousse.

08:32.625 --> 08:34.461
There's a lot going
on there, guys, yeah?

08:34.461 --> 08:36.131
Oh, but they're all connected.
They're all Italian,
they're all Irish.

08:36.131 --> 08:37.902
We got his mashed potatoes
over here.

08:37.902 --> 08:40.239
It sounds the most ambitious
dish I've heard so far
in this competition.

08:40.239 --> 08:41.509
Let's hope you
can pull it off.
Good luck.

08:41.509 --> 08:43.445
Thank you, Chef.

08:45.584 --> 08:47.655
We are halfway, guys.
30 minutes gone,

08:47.655 --> 08:50.092
30 minutes remaining.

08:51.829 --> 08:54.100
All right, get in there.
I'll head in here.

08:55.303 --> 08:56.471
Adam, tell me
about the dish.

08:56.471 --> 08:59.177
The dish is Japanese
fried chicken

08:59.177 --> 09:03.553
with a, um, miso, um,
miso parsnip‐‐ miso, um‐‐

09:03.553 --> 09:06.659
Yeah, so miso.
Me so ( bleep ) confused.

09:06.659 --> 09:09.732
‐ ( laughing )
‐ Deep fried chicken elevated?

09:09.732 --> 09:12.605
Me so ready to go
( bleep ) home.

09:12.605 --> 09:16.746
Seriously? Deep fried
Japanese ( bleep ) chicken.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.500
Deep fried chicken elevated?
Me so confused.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.039
Me so ready to go
( bleep ) home.

09:30.039 --> 09:33.780
I knew in my gut that fried
chicken was not the way to go.

09:33.780 --> 09:36.719
And now that this
isn't panning out,
I am kicking myself.

09:36.719 --> 09:38.957
I just don't see much
going on.

09:38.957 --> 09:42.296
There's only 15 minutes left.
If we can't elevate this dish,

09:42.296 --> 09:44.502
Adam and I are going
head‐to‐head for elimination.

09:44.502 --> 09:47.306
I said elevate it.
That is not elevated.

09:47.306 --> 09:48.977
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

09:48.977 --> 09:50.847
We just don't have
a lot of time here,

09:50.847 --> 09:52.718
so let's just go
with what we've got.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.487
Sell it.

09:54.487 --> 09:57.561
All right, so I've got
your farce going now.

09:57.561 --> 10:00.499
I've got the mushrooms ready.
I'll put those potatoes
in the oven.

10:00.499 --> 10:02.403
‐ Yep.
‐ And we'll meet
in the middle.

10:02.403 --> 10:04.542
‐ Right. Christina,
how's it going?
‐ Great.

10:04.542 --> 10:05.577
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

10:05.577 --> 10:07.280
All right, so,
chicken roulade.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.717
We've got this
beautiful farce corn,

10:08.717 --> 10:11.789
roasted poblano peppers,
onions, a little cotija cheese

10:11.789 --> 10:14.027
‐ so it's oozy and gooey
and comforting.
‐ Nice. What's that there?

10:14.027 --> 10:17.366
This is for garnish.
It's really thinly sliced
Yukon gold potatoes,

10:17.366 --> 10:19.538
a little bit of butter
on these petals,

10:19.538 --> 10:21.876
some micro cilantro,
some beautiful microgreens.

10:21.876 --> 10:23.780
And how are you
gonna cook this
in under 30 minutes?

10:23.780 --> 10:27.253
You know what? With speed
and grace and technique.

10:27.253 --> 10:29.725
‐ Who's in charge, Christina?
‐ I'm in charge.

10:29.725 --> 10:31.094
You're in charge.
Who's in charge, Aarón?

10:31.094 --> 10:32.664
Christina's in charge,
of course.

10:32.664 --> 10:35.737
‐ Women rule the world.
‐ Eight minutes to go.

10:35.737 --> 10:36.906
Good man.

10:40.246 --> 10:41.849
Come on, Cate,
check that chicken.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.653
Gordon:
Two minutes to go.

10:43.653 --> 10:46.091
You've got
to start plating, guys.

10:46.091 --> 10:48.596
Remember, big advantage
for the winning team.

10:48.596 --> 10:52.003
For the losing team tonight,
a head‐to‐head battle

10:52.003 --> 10:54.140
with the person
you've just cooked with.

10:54.140 --> 10:55.677
‐ Sugar just broke my sauce.
‐ ( bleep ) get it back
together.

10:55.677 --> 10:56.979
If it doesn't work,
we have to nix it.

10:56.979 --> 10:58.182
I don't like these blobs.

10:58.182 --> 11:00.386
I think that's just
very distasteful.

11:00.386 --> 11:03.458
Gordon:
<i>60 seconds remaining.</i>
<i>Come on, guys. Speed up.</i>

11:03.458 --> 11:05.730
‐ It's almost like a gel now.
‐ It's too gelled?

11:05.730 --> 11:07.433
‐ Yeah.
‐ Wipe it off.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.937
‐ Gordon: Ten, nine...
‐ Get the sauce, get the sauce.

11:08.937 --> 11:11.976
‐ Fill it now, fill it now.
‐ Gordon: ...eight, seven, six,

11:11.976 --> 11:13.278
‐ five, four, three...
‐ Chicken, chicken, chicken.

11:13.278 --> 11:17.086
‐ Come on, come on.
‐ Gordon: Three, two, one.

11:17.086 --> 11:20.459
And stop.
Hands in the air.

11:20.459 --> 11:22.096
Good job, Adam.
I really think it's good.

11:22.096 --> 11:24.300
Our dish looks
( bleep ) horrible.

11:24.300 --> 11:27.440
Calm down.

11:27.440 --> 11:31.381
Great job.
Right, Christina and Aarón.

11:31.381 --> 11:34.387
Cannot wait to taste
your dish. Let's go.

11:36.893 --> 11:39.497
First of all,
it looks incredible.
That is a showstopper.

11:39.497 --> 11:42.671
‐ Describe your dish, please.
‐ Well, we have a mushroom

11:42.671 --> 11:46.579
<i>and roasted corn‐stuffed</i>
<i>chicken thigh and leg</i>

11:46.579 --> 11:48.516
<i>with a pasilla reduction.</i>

11:48.516 --> 11:51.522
Christina: <i>Roasted mushrooms</i>
<i>and potato glassed chips.</i>

11:54.561 --> 11:55.563
Wow.

12:02.310 --> 12:03.813
What's the heat
inside the chicken?

12:03.813 --> 12:07.888
‐ It's a little
roasted poblano.
‐ Mm, wow.

12:07.888 --> 12:09.123
Only one thing to say.

12:09.123 --> 12:11.494
Congratulations.
The winner is...

12:11.494 --> 12:13.900
( laughter )

12:13.900 --> 12:17.975
That is how a MasterChef
executes chicken and potatoes.

12:17.975 --> 12:20.179
Great job, both of you.
Amazing.

12:20.179 --> 12:21.582
‐ Beautiful.
‐ Good job.

12:21.582 --> 12:26.224
Are you serious?
They did all this
in 30 minutes?

12:26.224 --> 12:30.499
This is why Chef Aarón and
Chef Christina are at the top.

12:30.499 --> 12:34.575
We now need to taste
everything that you did.

12:34.575 --> 12:37.013
First up, Eboni and Cate,
please. Let's go.

12:37.013 --> 12:40.185
Eboni and I brought ourselves
together on this plate,

12:40.185 --> 12:43.125
and then elevated it
to a MasterChef level.

12:43.125 --> 12:46.632
<i>We're just hoping</i>
<i>that the judges see</i>
<i>and taste that.</i>

12:46.632 --> 12:48.870
I thought Aarón and Christina
blew it out of the park,

12:48.870 --> 12:52.410
but that looks incredible.
Cate, describe the dish, please.

12:52.410 --> 12:56.719
Cate:
<i>We have a French pan‐seared</i>
<i>chicken leg</i>

12:56.719 --> 12:59.892
<i>with some fondant potatoes</i>
<i>cooked in duck fat.</i>

12:59.892 --> 13:02.731
<i>a Granny Smith apple puree,</i>
<i>crispy pancetta,</i>

13:02.731 --> 13:04.333
<i>and then a beautiful</i>
<i>honey sauce.</i>

13:04.333 --> 13:06.705
Cooking potatoes
in duck fat?
Come on.

13:06.705 --> 13:09.343
That's right in
the chef's wheelhouse.

13:09.343 --> 13:11.181
Let's get in there.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.051
Chicken is cooked
beautifully.

13:13.051 --> 13:15.422
‐ It's moist...
and it's just glistening.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

13:15.422 --> 13:19.063
So why the sweetness as well
with the chicken?

13:19.063 --> 13:20.767
My children aren't
really big on meat.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.271
If you give them
something sweet,
they kinda pair well together,

13:23.271 --> 13:24.942
and then we just had
to elevate it.

13:24.942 --> 13:26.111
Listen, here's the thing.
It's delicious.

13:26.111 --> 13:27.647
‐ Let's get that right.
‐ Thank you.

13:27.647 --> 13:29.551
And I love the idea of what
you've done with the fondant.

13:29.551 --> 13:31.387
It's just an extraordinary
flavor 'cause it just melts
in your mouth.

13:31.387 --> 13:33.559
What would I change?
Less color on the chicken.

13:33.559 --> 13:35.229
‐ <i>A little bit more</i>
<i>delicate with that.</i>
‐ Cate: <i>Okay, yeah.</i>

13:35.229 --> 13:38.569
But you've taken
this cheap drum
and you've elevated it.

13:38.569 --> 13:41.241
That is definitely
MasterChef worthy.
Great job. Well done.

13:41.241 --> 13:43.245
Both: Thank you.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.355
So I like the apple
component.

13:48.355 --> 13:49.858
I think that's really
well thought of.

13:49.858 --> 13:52.196
<i>I like the little pieces</i>
<i>of bacon studded through that</i>

13:52.196 --> 13:55.803
'cause it's a nice break
from the sweetness of the sauce
and also the puree.

13:55.803 --> 13:57.607
And what I find most impressive
about this dish

13:57.607 --> 14:00.379
<i>is that there's something</i>
<i>very barbecue about this.</i>

14:00.379 --> 14:04.120
You really did create
that flavor and that feel
in a very short period of time.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.823
‐ Good stuff, ladies.
‐ Both: Thank you.

14:05.823 --> 14:07.761
‐ Nice job.
‐ Nice job, ladies.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.430
Both: Thank you.

14:14.608 --> 14:15.777
Christina:
<i>All right, Daniel, Jason.</i>

14:21.655 --> 14:24.093
What did you make
for us tonight?

14:24.093 --> 14:25.930
Daniel:
<i>We have a crispy chicken thigh.</i>

14:25.930 --> 14:27.266
<i>finished in a butter base.</i>

14:27.266 --> 14:29.938
<i>over a bed of sautéed spinach,</i>
<i>leeks,</i>

14:29.938 --> 14:31.542
<i>and hen‐of‐the‐wood</i>
<i>mushrooms</i>

14:31.542 --> 14:35.449
<i>with a light Asian velouté,</i>
<i>and creamy potato gratin.</i>

14:35.449 --> 14:38.623
Remind me how you guys ended up
working together on a team.

14:38.623 --> 14:40.627
Daniel has a great palette
background.

14:40.627 --> 14:42.363
We're from the same
Boston area.

14:42.363 --> 14:44.133
We could kinda talk
ideas out,

14:44.133 --> 14:46.739
bring lots of different
techniques and have
a cohesive plate.

14:49.243 --> 14:52.316
It's light.
I like the color
of the dish.

14:52.316 --> 14:54.153
I think that the seasoned
breadcrumbs was super smart.

14:54.153 --> 14:55.857
I don't love the plating.

14:55.857 --> 14:58.663
‐ The chicken feels very small
compared to the gratin.
‐ Okay.

14:58.663 --> 15:00.667
I would have loved
a little bit more seasoning.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.508
When you go to make a gratin,
you really gotta make sure
you over‐season that liquid.

15:04.508 --> 15:07.881
'cause you'd be amazed
how much seasoning the potatoes
in a gratin need.

15:07.881 --> 15:09.685
I think it's
a pretty good effort.

15:09.685 --> 15:11.689
Both: Thank you, Chef.

15:14.293 --> 15:17.567
Next up, Gabriel, Yachecia,
please, let's go.

15:22.409 --> 15:25.850
Those aren't good faces.

15:25.850 --> 15:28.856
Uh, did the chicken take off?

15:28.856 --> 15:31.562
‐ Both: No, Chef.
‐ Describe the morsel.

15:31.562 --> 15:35.335
‐ It is a chicken roulade
with Swiss chard‐‐
‐ A chicken roulade?

15:35.335 --> 15:37.373
Where is that?
Underneath?

15:37.373 --> 15:41.180
'Cause I feel like it's been
planted in my daughter's
doll's house.

15:41.180 --> 15:43.753
A chicken roulade it's not.

15:43.753 --> 15:47.527
Where's the roulade,
and where's the chicken?

15:55.442 --> 15:58.281
A chicken roulade it's not.

16:00.753 --> 16:02.489
Where's the roulade,
and where's the chicken?

16:05.730 --> 16:09.236
‐ Did you see Aarón's roulade?
‐ Both: Yes, Chef.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.675
That's what you call
a roulade.

16:11.675 --> 16:13.244
Describe the dish,
Gabriel.

16:13.244 --> 16:15.081
Gabriel:
<i>It's a stuffed chicken thigh</i>

16:15.081 --> 16:18.455
<i>with some greens,</i>
<i>potatoes gratin,</i>
<i>and a red wine sauce.</i>

16:18.455 --> 16:21.695
A red wine what?
What is the red wine?

16:21.695 --> 16:26.204
It broke completely.
It was very, very acidic
and we tried to fix it.

16:26.204 --> 16:29.076
So, chicken roulade?

16:29.076 --> 16:31.080
Holy ( bleep ).

16:34.053 --> 16:37.226
‐ Who cooked this little
dollop of a potato?
‐ I did, Chef.

16:37.226 --> 16:39.998
I mean, that's the only visual
impact on the plate that looks
beautiful.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.133
How long did you
cook them for?

16:41.133 --> 16:43.839
I cooked them in the oven
for about 35 minutes.

16:43.839 --> 16:47.847
Wow.
The potato is delicious.

16:47.847 --> 16:50.653
Roulade is a disaster.
The sauce is dreadful.

16:50.653 --> 16:53.592
Crispy skin is just bizarre.

16:53.592 --> 16:57.032
But the potatoes
are to die for,
so I'm pissed off.

16:57.032 --> 16:58.368
You didn't listen
to each other.

16:58.368 --> 17:00.171
You weren't playing
to your strengths.

17:00.171 --> 17:03.444
I think equally, on your own,
both of you could have done
a better job.

17:03.444 --> 17:04.781
I agree.

17:06.885 --> 17:09.456
I am totally embarrassed.

17:09.456 --> 17:12.964
<i>This is the worst thing</i>
<i>that I have ever presented.</i>

17:12.964 --> 17:16.404
In my mind,
I already have a black apron on

17:16.404 --> 17:19.578
<i>and preparing for my third</i>
<i>head‐to‐head challenge.</i>

17:22.584 --> 17:23.953
Dino and Jeff, please.

17:26.424 --> 17:28.328
Jeff:
<i>I'm extremely proud</i>
<i>right now.</i>

17:28.328 --> 17:31.835
I mean, Dino and I set aside
our egos, our tension,

17:31.835 --> 17:36.277
maybe our animosity
against each other,
and focused in on winning.

17:36.277 --> 17:39.618
I'm totally hoping
that the judges see that
and recognize it

17:39.618 --> 17:42.189
<i>and more importantly,</i>
<i>appreciate that.</i>

17:42.189 --> 17:43.859
Describe the dish,
please.

17:43.859 --> 17:47.466
So what we have here is
a pine nut Italian herb‐crusted

17:47.466 --> 17:50.472
<i>chicken leg parmesan</i>
<i>lollipop.</i>

17:50.472 --> 17:53.144
<i>Underneath that,</i>
<i>we have a lemon garlic pesto.</i>

17:53.144 --> 17:55.650
And then what we have here
is a potato cannelloni

17:55.650 --> 17:57.720
<i>that's stuffed with a chicken</i>
<i>and potato mousse,</i>

17:57.720 --> 18:00.726
<i>with a nice little parm crisp</i>
<i>for some height.</i>

18:02.764 --> 18:05.603
Oh, man.
Look at that.

18:05.603 --> 18:07.507
That looks perfect.

18:07.507 --> 18:08.842
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Nice job.

18:08.842 --> 18:10.345
Thank you.

18:10.345 --> 18:11.948
‐ Nice.
‐ Ooh!

18:11.948 --> 18:14.286
That's glistening.
Did you guys work
together well?

18:14.286 --> 18:15.690
‐ Yes, we did.
‐ Without a doubt.

18:15.690 --> 18:17.292
Dino:
I was very nervous
about having to work with him,

18:17.292 --> 18:18.796
but then at the end of the day,
we just stopped and said,

18:18.796 --> 18:21.067
"Okay, you know,
it doesn't matter who has
the bigger balls."

18:21.067 --> 18:22.202
We really want to win
this thing.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.373
‐ And it shows on the plate.
‐ Thank you.

18:24.373 --> 18:26.477
'Cause that chicken
is dynamite.

18:26.477 --> 18:28.749
‐ Thank you.
‐ I love the texture

18:28.749 --> 18:30.418
and the herbaceous punch
from the crust.

18:30.418 --> 18:32.022
For me,
this is a little strange.

18:32.022 --> 18:35.730
‐ Okay.
‐ Puree and chicken,
making a mousse out of it?

18:35.730 --> 18:38.334
That's asking a lot,
but I can look at this dish

18:38.334 --> 18:40.873
and say chicken and potatoes
were the star.

18:40.873 --> 18:42.710
‐ Excellent job.
‐ Thank you very much.

18:42.710 --> 18:44.881
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Nice job.

18:44.881 --> 18:47.854
Looks like me and Jeff...
( chuckles )

18:47.854 --> 18:50.559
can kick a lot more ass
than anyone here expected.

18:50.559 --> 18:54.466
I think people are
really going to regret
their underestimation of us.

18:56.738 --> 19:00.278
Next up, please,
Caitlin and Adam.

19:00.278 --> 19:04.153
This was a hard challenge.
I thought being put in teams
of two was gonna be simple.

19:04.153 --> 19:06.223
It's only two voices
to put forward on a plate.

19:06.223 --> 19:09.831
<i>But, man, it really proved</i>
<i>challenging to marry</i>

19:09.831 --> 19:12.870
Adam's Japanese inspiration
with what I know.

19:12.870 --> 19:14.406
What did you make
for us tonight?

19:14.406 --> 19:17.345
Adam:
<i>We made a Japanese</i>
<i>fried chicken with miso,</i>

19:17.345 --> 19:20.719
<i>a potato puree,</i>
<i>and a sake slaw.</i>

19:20.719 --> 19:22.690
Did you guys taste
all the elements together?

19:22.690 --> 19:26.430
‐ Not all of them together.
‐ Mm, wrong answer.

19:26.430 --> 19:29.637
So you're gonna combine
something that you haven't
tasted together yet?

19:29.637 --> 19:31.641
How did you make it
this far?

19:37.219 --> 19:40.258
I can see that you're clearly
trying to raise the bar
in terms of plating.

19:40.258 --> 19:42.462
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Because you thought about
the color of the plate.

19:42.462 --> 19:45.736
‐ Caitlin: Absolutely.
‐ You thought about how you
were gonna lay the food out.

19:45.736 --> 19:47.239
But it's clear
that you didn't taste

19:47.239 --> 19:48.775
the elements
of the dish together

19:48.775 --> 19:51.781
because really
the only thing
you can taste

19:51.781 --> 19:56.423
is this sort of miso glue
that is the puree on the plate.

19:56.423 --> 19:59.263
The chicken is just
kinda nothing for me.

19:59.263 --> 20:02.435
And to be honest,
I'm thinking, "Okay,
so in 60 minutes,

20:02.435 --> 20:05.108
Adam made
fried chicken nuggets,

20:05.108 --> 20:09.517
and in 60 minutes,
Caitlin made a potato puree,

20:09.517 --> 20:11.721
fried some Brussels sprouts
and made slaw."

20:11.721 --> 20:15.663
‐ That's embarrassing.
‐ Yeah.

20:15.663 --> 20:17.165
( whispers )
I think we're okay.

20:19.336 --> 20:21.975
( exhales sharply )
Uh, wow.

20:21.975 --> 20:25.248
This Japanese?
It's a chicken nugget.

20:25.248 --> 20:29.189
Come on.
I'm more ( bleep )
Japanese than this.

20:29.189 --> 20:35.068
And then the pomegranates.
It's like you guys couldn't
stop yourselves.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.339
I mean, I swear to God.

20:37.339 --> 20:39.376
I've seen what
you've both done
in this competition,

20:39.376 --> 20:40.579
and you've had
moments of brilliance,

20:40.579 --> 20:43.384
but tonight,
you just accepted ( bleep ),

20:43.384 --> 20:44.687
and look at the result.

20:44.687 --> 20:46.357
A soggy, disgusting nugget

20:46.357 --> 20:48.695
sat on a bed
of unwanted slaw

20:48.695 --> 20:51.066
over a gummy ( bleep ) puree

20:51.066 --> 20:54.072
that I'd give my granddad
to paste his ( bleep ) house,
put up new wallpaper.

20:54.072 --> 20:57.412
Not to eat.
Disgusting.

21:00.919 --> 21:02.723
Taste your food.

21:02.723 --> 21:06.898
I feel like I'm being lost
in translation in this kitchen.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.403
Best teams are the ones
where it's not about friendship.

21:09.403 --> 21:11.407
‐ It's about getting to the top.
‐ Absolutely.

21:11.407 --> 21:13.678
Adam:
<i>This dish was really</i>
<i>my brainchild.</i>

21:13.678 --> 21:17.018
<i>And I'm having a really hard</i>
<i>time trying to prove</i>

21:17.018 --> 21:18.622
that I belong
in this competition.

21:22.395 --> 21:25.435
There was one team
that really impressed us.

21:25.435 --> 21:28.708
<i>Both of their voices</i>
<i>were on the dish.</i>

21:28.708 --> 21:30.044
The ideas
were well executed.

21:30.044 --> 21:32.917
And the flavors
were spot on.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.221
The team with the best
chicken and potato dish,

21:35.221 --> 21:40.098
the two home cooks that will
share their recipe with America

21:40.098 --> 21:43.170
on the pages
of "Family Circle" magazine,

21:43.170 --> 21:46.778
that dish belonged to...

21:48.247 --> 21:50.853
‐ Eboni and Cate.
‐ ( both cheering )

21:50.853 --> 21:53.825
Congratulations.

21:53.825 --> 21:56.330
( screaming )

21:56.330 --> 21:59.537
Head up to the balcony.
Congratulations.

21:59.537 --> 22:02.142
Eboni:
<i>My recipe is gonna be in</i>
<i>"Family Circle" magazine.</i>

22:02.142 --> 22:04.981
This is huge.
My kids are gonna be
so proud of me.

22:04.981 --> 22:07.620
They can brag, "My mommy's in
'Family Circle' magazine."

22:07.620 --> 22:10.592
Yes, I am.
I deserve this one.

22:10.592 --> 22:13.264
And I'm so glad I got it.

22:13.264 --> 22:15.067
We killed it.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.973
There are two other teams
tonight that did just enough,

22:17.973 --> 22:20.979
created delicious flavors,
to stay in this competition.

22:24.286 --> 22:26.791
Dino and Jeff
and Daniel and Jason.

22:26.791 --> 22:28.929
‐ <i>Please head up</i>
<i>to the balcony.</i>
‐ Thank you, Chef.

22:28.929 --> 22:32.435
‐ Whoo! Good job.
‐ Good job, you guys.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.372
Magazine writers.

22:35.642 --> 22:38.949
Now it comes down
to you two teams.

22:38.949 --> 22:43.457
Both teams
had the worst dishes.

22:43.457 --> 22:46.296
The final team

22:46.296 --> 22:48.868
that will be safe
from elimination tonight...

22:51.240 --> 22:52.643
is...

23:05.468 --> 23:07.138
The final team

23:07.138 --> 23:09.175
that will be safe
from elimination tonight...

23:10.512 --> 23:11.981
is...

23:11.981 --> 23:13.284
Adam and Caitlin.

23:16.456 --> 23:18.828
It's not you.

23:18.828 --> 23:21.500
And you know it.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.372
Gabriel and Yachecia,
you did just enough.

23:24.372 --> 23:27.412
The saving grace
were those potatoes.

23:27.412 --> 23:30.017
Now both of you,
piss off.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.019
Yes, Chef.

23:31.019 --> 23:32.990
( weak applause )

23:34.727 --> 23:36.531
I've worked
so hard to improve,

23:36.531 --> 23:38.500
<i>and to be</i>
<i>back in this spot,</i>

23:38.500 --> 23:40.338
<i>it's like back</i>
<i>at square one.</i>

23:40.338 --> 23:41.908
<i>I want to show everyone</i>
<i>on the balcony</i>

23:41.908 --> 23:44.179
<i>and I want to show the judges</i>
<i>that I do deserve to be here.</i>

23:44.179 --> 23:46.350
<i>My only choice</i>
<i>is to send Adam home.</i>

23:49.189 --> 23:51.460
Earlier tonight,
Christina and Aarón

23:51.460 --> 23:54.800
showed you what they can do
with chicken and potatoes.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.539
Now it's my way
or the highway.

23:57.539 --> 23:59.977
Tonight,
you'll be making...

24:01.614 --> 24:02.916
‐ ( gasps )
‐ Wow.

24:02.916 --> 24:05.522
my signature
chicken and potato dish.
Look at it.

24:05.522 --> 24:09.663
<i>A stunning</i>
<i>poached and then seared</i>
<i>chicken supreme,</i>

24:09.663 --> 24:13.404
<i>served with crispy</i>
<i>truffle croquettes</i>

24:13.404 --> 24:15.842
<i>on a bed of delicious</i>
<i>wilted spinach</i>

24:15.842 --> 24:18.681
<i>with caramelized,</i>
<i>charred endive,</i>

24:18.681 --> 24:23.758
<i>glazed with an incredible,</i>
<i>light chicken truffle jus.</i>

24:23.758 --> 24:26.029
And now, your fate
in this competition

24:26.029 --> 24:29.102
depends on you both
replicating this dish

24:29.102 --> 24:31.373
exactly to my standards,

24:31.373 --> 24:35.916
or for one of you,
this journey ends.

24:35.916 --> 24:38.053
Please, step up
and try the dish.

24:39.924 --> 24:43.096
I've never made anything
this elevated in my life.

24:43.096 --> 24:44.967
Christina:
Take a look, have a taste.

24:44.967 --> 24:47.138
Adam:
<i>There is so much</i>
<i>going on on this plate.</i>

24:47.138 --> 24:49.743
<i>All the truffles,</i>
<i>all the coquettes,</i>

24:49.743 --> 24:52.348
<i>this rich and</i>
<i>juicy chicken.</i>

24:52.348 --> 24:54.319
Christina:
Look at that dish carefully.

24:54.319 --> 24:55.822
Adam:
<i>As I'm keeping track</i>

24:55.822 --> 24:57.626
<i>of everything</i>
<i>that I have to do,</i>

24:57.626 --> 25:00.932
I'm starting to get
ridiculously intimidated.

25:00.932 --> 25:03.070
‐ Any questions?
‐ Caitlin: For the
mashed potatoes,

25:03.070 --> 25:05.441
‐ is it better
to pipe them cold?
‐ Good question.

25:05.441 --> 25:08.046
Cool it down first,
but before you cool
it down, taste it.

25:08.046 --> 25:09.717
It's so much better to perfect
the seasoning when it's warm

25:09.717 --> 25:11.621
rather than trying
to season something
when it's cold.

25:11.621 --> 25:14.225
Adam, Caitlin,
please both of you,
head to your stations.

25:14.225 --> 25:16.564
Caitlin:
<i>Every element</i>
<i>in this chicken supreme dish</i>

25:16.564 --> 25:19.135
<i>has been mastered</i>
<i>by Chef Ramsay.</i>

25:19.135 --> 25:21.139
Not in a day,
not in 60 minutes,

25:21.139 --> 25:22.776
<i>over years of hard work.</i>

25:22.776 --> 25:24.145
<i>This'll be</i>
<i>the most important dish</i>

25:24.145 --> 25:25.815
<i>I've cooked</i>
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

25:27.451 --> 25:30.090
Aarón:
<i>At your stations,</i>
<i>you have everything you need</i>

25:30.090 --> 25:33.598
<i>to replicate Gordon's</i>
<i>chicken and potato dish.</i>

25:33.598 --> 25:37.471
You have 45 minutes to execute
this dish flawlessly.

25:37.471 --> 25:39.342
‐ Both: Yes, Chef.
‐ Gordon: Right.

25:39.342 --> 25:41.847
Caitlin, Adam,
both of you, good luck.

25:41.847 --> 25:44.218
Your 45 minutes...

25:44.218 --> 25:45.789
starts... now.

25:46.791 --> 25:48.695
‐ ( applause )
‐ Let's go.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.472
I definitely don't think
I'm going home tonight.

25:54.472 --> 25:57.144
I've had to fight my way
out of this position
multiple times before,

25:57.144 --> 26:00.017
and I don't think
Adam is as comfortable
with some of the basics

26:00.017 --> 26:02.121
so if you can't poach
chicken or mashed potato

26:02.121 --> 26:03.825
how can you make
Gordon Ramsey's chicken supreme?

26:03.825 --> 26:05.094
Yeah, girl.

26:06.597 --> 26:08.266
I'm feeling good right now.
You know, we failed as a team,

26:08.266 --> 26:09.803
but I'm gonna persevere
as an individual.

26:09.803 --> 26:11.272
Going up against
the queen of second chances

26:11.272 --> 26:13.276
but, uh,
even the mighty fall.

26:13.276 --> 26:16.651
If I execute really well,
I think I can do it.

26:16.651 --> 26:19.188
Now guys,
this dish is tricky.

26:19.188 --> 26:21.527
Whoever makes it out alive
will absolutely deserve

26:21.527 --> 26:23.330
‐ to be in the top nine.
‐ Gordon: Very tricky.

26:23.330 --> 26:26.169
The A to Z, in a nutshell
is get the potatoes on first.

26:26.169 --> 26:29.375
The base of the croquettes,
nice, light, airy, truffle
mashed potatoes,

26:29.375 --> 26:32.314
rolled into a cylinder,
lightly panko bread crumbed,

26:32.314 --> 26:34.085
and they get fried
at the last minute.

26:34.085 --> 26:36.824
But tonight, it's all
about that chicken breast.

26:36.824 --> 26:39.095
Poach it with the skin on,
and keep it nice and moist.

26:39.095 --> 26:42.168
With five minutes to go,
take it out, remove the skin,

26:42.168 --> 26:44.506
and then lightly sear it
by basting it

26:44.506 --> 26:46.342
with a little touch
of truffle butter.

26:46.342 --> 26:48.881
It's all
about the timing.

26:48.881 --> 26:50.752
Yes.
Good dry potatoes.

26:50.752 --> 26:53.591
Christina:
Just 30 minutes to go,

26:53.591 --> 26:56.697
and for one of you,
your last 30 minutes
in this kitchen.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.845
Right, Caitlin,
how you feeling?

27:03.845 --> 27:06.584
Doing well, Chef.
Got the potatoes
boiling now.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.554
Gonna be poaching
my chicken here
in a minute.

27:08.554 --> 27:10.859
What do you think's
the most technical element
to nail on that dish?

27:10.859 --> 27:12.529
I think
the cook of the chicken

27:12.529 --> 27:13.698
is gonna be
the biggest challenge.

27:13.698 --> 27:15.668
I want to make sure
it's not overdone,

27:15.668 --> 27:17.672
especially the chicken breast,
because there's no fat.

27:17.672 --> 27:19.075
I don't want it
to be dry and stringy.

27:19.075 --> 27:20.678
<i>No. Now, you're</i>
<i>a professional dancer.</i>

27:20.678 --> 27:22.281
So you've had hundreds
of knockbacks.

27:22.281 --> 27:25.454
So how do you
bring that element
in to this challenge now

27:25.454 --> 27:26.590
to stay on top of it?

27:26.590 --> 27:28.026
You know, I've been
dancing since I was two,

27:28.026 --> 27:29.930
and my entire life
I've fostered

27:29.930 --> 27:31.634
this really deep
sense of confidence,

27:31.634 --> 27:33.538
so if I'm gonna survive
in this competition,

27:33.538 --> 27:35.274
I need to bring
that confidence
to my cooking.

27:35.274 --> 27:36.644
‐ Can you beat him tonight?
‐ Yeah, absolutely,

27:36.644 --> 27:38.046
I can beat him tonight.
It's not a question.

27:38.046 --> 27:40.050
Just under
30 minutes to nail it.
Good luck.

27:40.050 --> 27:41.286
Thank you, Chef.

27:41.286 --> 27:42.388
Cate: Good luck, you guys,
keep it up.

27:42.388 --> 27:45.060
Work smart, guys.
Work smart.

27:45.060 --> 27:46.396
‐ All right, Adam.
‐ Yes, Chef.

27:46.396 --> 27:48.333
Tonight is
your night to prove

27:48.333 --> 27:50.237
that you are the best student
in this kitchen,

27:50.237 --> 27:51.406
better than Caitlin.

27:51.406 --> 27:53.343
My head is
in the game right now.

27:53.343 --> 27:56.082
I really know that I need
to get this croquette

27:56.082 --> 27:57.986
really well seasoned
with truffle butter.

27:57.986 --> 28:01.459
I'm focusing completely
on getting the replication
exactly right.

28:01.459 --> 28:02.929
Okay. Talk to me
about that chicken breast.

28:02.929 --> 28:04.800
Uh, that chicken breast
is now poaching

28:04.800 --> 28:06.937
in chicken stock,
garlic and thyme.

28:06.937 --> 28:08.206
Now are you
just poaching it?

28:08.206 --> 28:09.643
Is there another element
that you're cooking it‐‐

28:09.643 --> 28:12.047
I'm poaching it,
and then I'm gonna
pan fry it,

28:12.047 --> 28:13.951
‐ and baste it with butter.
‐ Okay.

28:13.951 --> 28:15.622
‐ You're an Ivy League
student.
‐ That's right.

28:15.622 --> 28:17.458
‐ Show it to us
on that plate tonight.
‐ Yes, Chef.

28:17.458 --> 28:18.728
‐ Let's go.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

28:18.728 --> 28:20.163
( cheering )

28:20.163 --> 28:21.499
Eboni:
Come on, y'all can do this.

28:22.636 --> 28:25.474
Less than ten minutes
to go, guys.

28:25.474 --> 28:27.779
This is where it all
starts to come together.

28:29.983 --> 28:31.820
Wow, this is intense.

28:31.820 --> 28:33.089
I mean, I've never
seen them focused

28:33.089 --> 28:34.492
as much as they are
right now.

28:34.492 --> 28:36.095
Which home cook has it?

28:36.095 --> 28:38.166
I think Caitlin
is running behind,

28:38.166 --> 28:40.337
but she handles pressure
better than Adam,

28:40.337 --> 28:42.441
so right now,
my money is on Caitlin.

28:42.441 --> 28:43.678
For me,
it has to be Adam.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.380
He's well ahead
of the game.

28:45.380 --> 28:47.652
He's gonna make
a quick little vinaigrette,
it looks like.

28:47.652 --> 28:48.821
He's on it.

28:53.564 --> 28:55.300
Cate: If I was Adam,
I would be wrapping
that chicken

28:55.300 --> 28:57.806
in plastic wrap right now
to not let it dry out.

28:58.975 --> 29:02.247
Adam's chicken is out
on top of his board.

29:02.247 --> 29:03.985
‐ Aarón: Oh, God.
‐ Christina: That poached
chicken breast

29:03.985 --> 29:07.257
is gonna cool down,
even if he goes
into searing it,

29:07.257 --> 29:09.128
we're gonna get raw chicken
or dry chicken.

29:10.865 --> 29:12.669
Three minutes to go.

29:14.973 --> 29:16.142
( bleep )

29:17.311 --> 29:18.380
‐ Ooh.
‐ No!

29:18.380 --> 29:20.785
Her chicken's still
a little under.

29:20.785 --> 29:24.993
I see pink fleshy chicken
in the thickest part
of my breast.

29:24.993 --> 29:26.295
( bleep )

29:28.968 --> 29:30.538
I think Caitlin's
chicken's raw, guys.

29:30.538 --> 29:33.309
‐ Ooh.
‐ She's putting chicken
back in the pan after slicing.

29:33.309 --> 29:34.513
( groans )

29:34.513 --> 29:37.351
Two minutes to go!
Come on, guys!

29:37.351 --> 29:39.656
I'm screwed.
There's no way

29:39.656 --> 29:41.392
I'm getting this chicken cooked
with two minutes left.

29:41.392 --> 29:45.067
She could be going home
minutes from now.

29:45.067 --> 29:47.371
Oh, my God.

29:52.882 --> 29:55.053
Two minutes to go.
Come on, guys.

29:55.053 --> 29:56.924
( bleep )

29:56.924 --> 29:59.361
‐ I think Caitlin's
chicken's raw, guys.
‐ Ooh.

29:59.361 --> 30:01.633
<i>She's put her chicken</i>
<i>back in the pan after slicing.</i>

30:01.633 --> 30:03.036
Gordon: <i>Wow.</i>

30:03.036 --> 30:04.706
Here's how you can
bring Caitlin's
chicken back.

30:04.706 --> 30:06.877
Get it into a pan
and start basting it
with that truffle butter.

30:06.877 --> 30:08.881
There she goes,
she's doing it.
She's doing it.

30:11.787 --> 30:13.389
I think she can pull it back.
She has her spinach,

30:13.389 --> 30:15.260
she has all
the other components
ready to go.

30:15.260 --> 30:16.663
Gordon:
Last minute, guys!
Come on!

30:16.663 --> 30:18.266
Watch your endive!

30:19.401 --> 30:21.907
‐ ( gasps )
‐ Uh‐oh.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.944
Christina:
Caitlin's burnt all
of her endives.

30:23.944 --> 30:25.915
She's gotta
start them over.

30:25.915 --> 30:27.585
She's falling apart.

30:27.585 --> 30:28.921
Jeff:
Come on, Adam.
Don't give up now.

30:28.921 --> 30:31.660
‐ Eboni: Nice, Adam.
‐ Yachecia: Beautiful.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.931
Watch those pans.

30:33.931 --> 30:35.267
Yachecia:
Baste the chicken!

30:35.267 --> 30:36.603
Make sure you got
all the elements
on the plate.

30:36.603 --> 30:39.609
‐ Do not panic.
‐ Focus, focus!

30:39.609 --> 30:42.615
‐ Aarón: Come on, guys.
‐ 15 seconds to go!

30:42.615 --> 30:44.351
Get everything
on the plate, let's go.

30:44.351 --> 30:45.788
‐ You gotta move!
‐ Do it!

30:45.788 --> 30:46.957
‐ Don't forget the truffles.
‐ Come on, guys.

30:46.957 --> 30:48.126
Ten...

30:48.126 --> 30:51.065
All:
Nine, eight, seven,

30:51.065 --> 30:54.138
six, five, four,

30:54.138 --> 30:56.810
three, two, one.

30:56.810 --> 30:59.081
‐ Gordon: And stop!
‐ ( cheering )

31:00.585 --> 31:02.789
Yeah!

31:02.789 --> 31:05.093
Christina:
Time to see
which one of you

31:05.093 --> 31:08.701
was best able to replicate
Gordon's dish.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.105
Please bring your dishes
to the front.

31:13.209 --> 31:15.781
‐ Jeff: Caitlin, beautiful.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

31:15.781 --> 31:17.284
Jeff:
Nice job, Adam.

31:17.284 --> 31:19.488
Daniel:
Both of you guys, nice job.

31:19.488 --> 31:21.459
Yachecia:
<i>Adam's plate is beautiful.</i>

31:21.459 --> 31:24.966
This is the Adam
I have been looking for
in this competition,

31:24.966 --> 31:26.903
<i>and I expected</i>
<i>no less from Caitlin.</i>

31:26.903 --> 31:29.676
<i>Caitlin is a rock star</i>
<i>in these challenges.</i>

31:29.676 --> 31:32.080
I think this is
gonna be a very tough call.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.552
Right. Caitlin,
let's start with you.

31:34.552 --> 31:36.255
So, you did
something earlier.

31:36.255 --> 31:38.827
You sliced your chicken,
and it was undercooked.

31:38.827 --> 31:41.566
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ And with less
than two minutes to go,

31:41.566 --> 31:44.104
you did the smartest thing.
You put it back in the pan.

31:44.104 --> 31:46.510
Caitlin:
<i>I think where I fell short</i>
<i>is just that my chicken breast</i>

31:46.510 --> 31:48.547
<i>is very thick</i>
<i>at its deepest part.</i>

31:48.547 --> 31:50.851
<i>I needed to baste it</i>
<i>in the pan longer,</i>

31:50.851 --> 31:53.256
<i>but with time ticking,</i>
<i>I also wanted the meat</i>

31:53.256 --> 31:54.626
<i>to have plenty</i>
<i>of time to rest.</i>

31:54.626 --> 31:55.695
Hopefully I made up
for it later

31:55.695 --> 31:58.032
by basting
in that truffle butter.

31:58.032 --> 31:59.869
Right, let's get in there.
Croquettes,

31:59.869 --> 32:01.807
they look slightly
too big,

32:01.807 --> 32:04.879
but just by putting my knife
and my fork through,

32:04.879 --> 32:06.817
‐ it's fluffy in the center,
which is good.
‐ Awesome.

32:06.817 --> 32:07.819
How long did
you cook them for?

32:07.819 --> 32:09.321
I think a couple
of minutes.

32:09.321 --> 32:11.158
I was really
just judging by color.

32:13.229 --> 32:16.202
It's delicious,
and just the right amount
of balance with truffle oil.

32:16.202 --> 32:17.505
Thank you, Chef.

32:17.505 --> 32:19.943
Chicken, how long did you
poach the breast for?

32:19.943 --> 32:22.013
Just short of 12 minutes.

32:26.188 --> 32:28.059
‐ Chicken's cooked beautifully.
‐ Caitlin: Oh.

32:28.059 --> 32:29.562
Nice job, Caitlin.

32:29.562 --> 32:31.298
Whew!

32:31.298 --> 32:33.737
Gordon:
Every slice
is glistening.

32:33.737 --> 32:35.306
With a layer
of truffle on there.

32:38.881 --> 32:42.755
It's moist.
It's incredibly
soft and tender.

32:42.755 --> 32:44.626
Thank you, Chef.

32:44.626 --> 32:47.130
Endive has gone
past that caramelization

32:47.130 --> 32:48.433
and is just on
the verge of burning,

32:48.433 --> 32:50.136
but, flavors are there.

32:50.136 --> 32:53.142
Here's the thing:
it took me years
to perfect this dish.

32:53.142 --> 32:55.581
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ You've just pulled it off
in 45 minutes.

32:55.581 --> 32:57.083
‐ Good job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

32:58.587 --> 32:59.989
Aarón: Are you happy
with the caramelization

32:59.989 --> 33:01.258
on the actual
chicken breast?

33:01.258 --> 33:03.095
I'm very happy
with the caramelization.

33:03.095 --> 33:05.801
I think actually the chicken
took on the most flavor

33:05.801 --> 33:07.538
and color in those
last few minutes,

33:07.538 --> 33:09.576
so it was
a happy accident, I guess.

33:09.576 --> 33:11.580
Good cooking
shouldn't be an accident.

33:11.580 --> 33:12.982
‐ Right?
‐ I agree.

33:12.982 --> 33:15.119
You know, for me,
the spinach kind of
got lost.

33:15.119 --> 33:16.422
I don't think
you had enough of it.

33:16.422 --> 33:17.992
I love the flavor
of the croquette,

33:17.992 --> 33:19.562
but it's
a little bit clunky.

33:19.562 --> 33:22.668
The sauce
is really lovely.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.004
<i>I wish you would have</i>
<i>reduced it down</i>

33:24.004 --> 33:25.908
<i>with a couple of nice</i>
<i>slices of that truffle</i>

33:25.908 --> 33:28.145
and really kind of
permeate inside that sauce,

33:28.145 --> 33:30.250
but the sauce
is proper consistency.

33:30.250 --> 33:32.354
I dig the endive
and the chicken is moist.

33:32.354 --> 33:33.757
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

33:33.757 --> 33:35.828
( cheers, applause )

33:38.700 --> 33:41.038
Adam, okay.

33:41.038 --> 33:43.109
Tonight you cooked
with emotion.

33:43.109 --> 33:44.478
<i>Watching you,</i>
<i>something really clicked</i>

33:44.478 --> 33:47.017
<i>that is like,</i>
<i>"He really wants this."</i>

33:47.017 --> 33:50.891
Why now after weeks and weeks
in this competition?

33:50.891 --> 33:53.229
Um, this is the first time
that I've let go

33:53.229 --> 33:56.468
and just cooked
because I love cooking.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.408
You know, my parents,
they're both doctors,

33:59.408 --> 34:01.813
<i>but for me,</i>
<i>my dream is cooking,</i>

34:01.813 --> 34:04.752
and as long
as I reach my potential,
no matter what it is,

34:04.752 --> 34:06.856
it will be worth it,
and I think this is

34:06.856 --> 34:10.129
<i>the most beautiful thing</i>
<i>I've ever made.</i>

34:10.129 --> 34:11.600
Cooking's a passion,

34:11.600 --> 34:13.135
and I think
these last 45 minutes

34:13.135 --> 34:14.872
has just confirmed that.

34:14.872 --> 34:17.477
There's not many young,
21‐year‐old cooks

34:17.477 --> 34:19.782
professionally tonight
in this country,

34:19.782 --> 34:21.653
that can cook at the speed
that you just did

34:21.653 --> 34:23.222
and produce
what you've just done.

34:23.222 --> 34:26.495
Whatever the result,
that's been your best
performance.

34:26.495 --> 34:28.399
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Good job.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.470
( applause )

34:30.470 --> 34:33.543
Now, the croquettes
look incredible.

34:33.543 --> 34:35.714
‐ Adam: Thank you.
‐ Gordon: As good as mine.

34:35.714 --> 34:38.720
Beautifully colored,
cylinder perfectly done.

34:38.720 --> 34:39.756
Can you guys see that
up in the balcony?

34:39.756 --> 34:41.225
‐ Yes.
‐ Yes, we can.

34:41.225 --> 34:43.496
Incredible. What did you
season the potatoes with?

34:43.496 --> 34:45.701
The potatoes seasoned
with a little white pepper,

34:45.701 --> 34:48.707
salt, and truffle butter.

34:50.844 --> 34:53.182
Delicious.
Delicious.

34:53.182 --> 34:56.856
Chicken looks beautiful.

34:56.856 --> 34:57.925
How long did you
poach it for?

34:57.925 --> 35:00.263
Uh, 17 minutes, about.

35:12.153 --> 35:15.193
Adam, chicken
looks beautiful.

35:15.193 --> 35:16.730
How long did you
poach it for?

35:16.730 --> 35:18.900
Uh, 17 minutes, about.

35:29.387 --> 35:30.524
You tell me.

35:31.926 --> 35:33.530
What's wrong with it?

35:37.605 --> 35:39.040
It's raw
in the middle, Chef.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.711
( all groaning quietly )

35:42.815 --> 35:46.623
Oh, Adam.
Damn, damn, damn,
damn, damn.

35:46.623 --> 35:49.562
Oh, dear.
Let's go to the end here.

35:55.273 --> 35:57.812
How ironic for me
to see you perform

35:57.812 --> 36:00.316
the best you've ever cooked
in this competition,

36:00.316 --> 36:05.561
nail a dish, and then
we get into the chicken
and it's under.

36:05.561 --> 36:08.032
The dish is
absolutely incredible.

36:08.032 --> 36:10.537
<i>The croquettes are light,</i>
<i>fluffy, crisp on the outside.</i>

36:10.537 --> 36:14.110
The actual flavors
are mind‐blowing.

36:14.110 --> 36:16.783
But what pains me

36:16.783 --> 36:18.285
you're 90 seconds short

36:18.285 --> 36:21.491
of having that chicken
cooked to perfection.

36:21.491 --> 36:24.264
I know how
talented you are,
you just proved that.

36:24.264 --> 36:26.501
But brilliant effort,
young man.

36:26.501 --> 36:28.405
Remember that.

36:28.405 --> 36:30.076
Cate:
It's okay, Adam.
You still did a great job.

36:30.076 --> 36:32.447
Jeff:
Take a deep breath, Adam.
Take a deep breath.

36:32.447 --> 36:34.752
‐ ( Adam sniffling )
‐ Eboni: It's okay, Adam.

36:39.361 --> 36:41.298
( whispering )
You did a great job, Adam.

36:44.605 --> 36:46.441
Damn.
It's raw.

36:50.651 --> 36:52.453
It's not over.

36:52.453 --> 36:55.026
<i>You made</i>
<i>a beautiful dish.</i>

36:55.026 --> 36:57.698
You took the feedback
that we've been giving you,

36:57.698 --> 37:00.504
and I saw you apply it
into every single thing
that you did,

37:00.504 --> 37:03.175
and I could not
have been more proud.

37:03.175 --> 37:06.081
Let's have a bite.
Potato croquettes,
gorgeous.

37:06.081 --> 37:07.818
Picture perfect.

37:10.524 --> 37:12.795
One thing I saw you do
that I didn't see Caitlin do

37:12.795 --> 37:15.099
you made that little
lemon vinaigrette at the end,

37:15.099 --> 37:17.370
and then you just
draped it over the chicken.

37:17.370 --> 37:18.940
‐ Why?
‐ I know lemon and chicken

37:18.940 --> 37:21.011
goes really,
really well together,

37:21.011 --> 37:23.783
and lemon also
tenderizes chicken.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.889
And so I wanted
the chicken to be‐‐
to be perfect,

37:26.889 --> 37:31.131
and so I did
everything I could.

37:31.131 --> 37:33.168
Christina:
Okay.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.907
You had so many
successful things
on your dish.

37:35.907 --> 37:38.913
The chicken is undercooked.
The sauce, too thick.

37:38.913 --> 37:40.016
Yes.

37:40.016 --> 37:42.688
But the things
that you nailed,
you nailed.

37:42.688 --> 37:46.028
The way that you
worked tonight,
nailed.

37:46.028 --> 37:47.998
Great deal of respect.
Nice job.

37:47.998 --> 37:49.000
Thanks so much, Chef.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.672
( applause )

37:54.344 --> 37:59.588
So many things right.
Guys, he was moving
like a MasterChef tonight.

37:59.588 --> 38:02.460
‐ but that chicken...
‐ Adam: <i>My dish looks beautiful,</i>

38:02.460 --> 38:04.565
but it has
the greatest error

38:04.565 --> 38:05.834
that any cook can make.

38:05.834 --> 38:08.338
Can we forgive
the cook on the chicken?

38:08.338 --> 38:09.909
I mean, he put
brilliance on the plate.

38:09.909 --> 38:13.182
Adam:
<i>The rest of the dish</i>
<i>was executed perfectly.</i>

38:13.182 --> 38:15.987
The heroes were
chicken and potatoes,

38:15.987 --> 38:17.691
‐ and potatoes he nailed.
‐ Yeah.

38:17.691 --> 38:20.229
Adam:
<i>I gave this my all,</i>

38:20.229 --> 38:24.003
and I just hope
that my all is enough
to keep me in.

38:31.619 --> 38:35.727
Home cooks,
we are so proud
of both of you.

38:35.727 --> 38:38.398
Tonight, one of you
makes the top nine,

38:38.398 --> 38:41.806
and one of you,
sadly, is going home.

38:44.979 --> 38:49.655
We probably don't need
to make it any more painful

38:49.655 --> 38:52.995
for the individual
that made

38:52.995 --> 38:56.067
one unacceptable error.

38:56.067 --> 38:59.107
I'm just gonna ask
that individual

38:59.107 --> 39:00.276
to do
the respectful thing

39:00.276 --> 39:04.350
and to say goodbye
and untie their apron.

39:09.093 --> 39:10.697
No.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.074
( sighs )

39:16.074 --> 39:18.813
Caitlin, say goodbye to Adam,
head on upstairs.

39:19.882 --> 39:22.386
‐ Thank you, Adam.
‐ Thank you.

39:23.623 --> 39:25.660
Adam:
You brought it
out of me.

39:27.230 --> 39:29.602
Good job, Adam!

39:29.602 --> 39:32.908
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Chin up! Chin up, brother.

39:32.908 --> 39:34.845
What a battle.
Honestly,

39:34.845 --> 39:37.350
<i>it feels amazing</i>
<i>to come out on top,</i>

39:37.350 --> 39:39.320
<i>but Adam did not go down</i>
<i>without a fight,</i>

39:39.320 --> 39:40.824
<i>and I'm bringing</i>
<i>that fight and that fire</i>

39:40.824 --> 39:43.128
to everything I do
going forward.

39:44.765 --> 39:45.767
Good job.

39:46.869 --> 39:48.873
Gordon:
Right, young man,

39:48.873 --> 39:51.111
that was the most incredible
45‐minute cook‐off

39:51.111 --> 39:52.380
we've ever seen.

39:52.380 --> 39:54.885
What's happened
is that it's confirmed

39:54.885 --> 39:58.726
that you are
a very passionate,
determined,

39:58.726 --> 40:00.630
amazing cook.

40:00.630 --> 40:03.468
You do have a future
in this industry.

40:04.972 --> 40:06.141
How are you feeling?

40:06.141 --> 40:08.378
My experience
in the MasterChef kitchen

40:08.378 --> 40:12.153
has unleashed
and awakened me.

40:12.153 --> 40:15.392
Cooking here,
in front of you,
with all my competitors

40:15.392 --> 40:18.031
has changed my life.

40:18.031 --> 40:20.670
My life is
on a radically
different path now

40:20.670 --> 40:22.541
than it was months ago.

40:22.541 --> 40:26.047
And I'm gonna be
holding this with me
forever.

40:26.047 --> 40:27.551
( sighs )

40:27.551 --> 40:29.354
Don't you dare
walk out of this kitchen

40:29.354 --> 40:32.794
and be anything less
than what you just were
in those last 45 minutes.

40:32.794 --> 40:34.698
Come and say goodbye.

40:34.698 --> 40:37.236
‐ Come on.
‐ ( applause )

40:37.236 --> 40:38.706
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ Well done. Well done.

40:38.706 --> 40:41.211
‐ Adam: <i>I'm sad to go...</i>
‐ Be proud of yourself, huh?

40:41.211 --> 40:43.716
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ <i>but the fact that</i>
<i>I made it to top ten</i>

40:43.716 --> 40:45.219
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen</i>

40:45.219 --> 40:47.223
is so life‐affirming.

40:47.223 --> 40:50.730
Tell your parents
that you're gonna be cooking
for the rest of your life.

40:50.730 --> 40:51.799
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Take care, buddy.

40:51.799 --> 40:53.235
‐ We love you, Adam.
‐ Love you, Adam.

40:53.235 --> 40:55.607
Adam:
<i>As hard as it was</i>
<i>to leave Harvard,</i>

40:55.607 --> 40:58.345
<i>coming here</i>
<i>to the MasterChef kitchen,</i>

40:58.345 --> 40:59.815
totally worth it.

41:02.319 --> 41:04.858
‐ Take care.
‐ Adam: <i>I don't have</i>
<i>to worry about</i>

41:04.858 --> 41:06.629
pursuing
investment banking,

41:06.629 --> 41:08.265
or pursuing
a law degree.

41:08.265 --> 41:13.208
I know what I'm going
to be doing for the rest
of my life.

41:13.208 --> 41:15.446
‐ Bye, Adam.
‐ Bye, Adam.

41:20.389 --> 41:22.326
Announcer:
<i>Next week...</i>

41:22.326 --> 41:23.963
‐ Switch!
‐ Oh, God!

41:23.963 --> 41:25.299
‐ Go, go!
‐ Boom.

41:25.299 --> 41:26.569
<i>...it's a tag team challenge...</i>

41:26.569 --> 41:27.838
Speed up, let's go.

41:27.838 --> 41:29.608
‐ Get those taquitos going.
‐ Shred, shred, shred!

41:29.608 --> 41:31.077
<i>...from south of the border.</i>

41:31.077 --> 41:32.179
Get 'em in the fryer.
Let's go!

41:32.179 --> 41:34.417
‐ Come on!
‐ <i>And the top nine...</i>

41:34.417 --> 41:36.354
Does it need a flip?
Does it need a flip?

41:36.354 --> 41:37.824
‐ <i>...feel the heat...</i>
‐ Whoo!

41:37.824 --> 41:39.427
‐ Damn it!
‐ <i>...like never before.</i>

41:39.427 --> 41:40.997
‐ Oh!
‐ Use a fork, use a fork.

41:40.997 --> 41:42.333
Let me do this ( bleep ),
all right?

41:42.333 --> 41:43.836
Get it in the pan.
You don't have time for that.

41:43.836 --> 41:45.472
Stop sounding stupid!

41:45.472 --> 41:47.142
‐ Oh, my God!
‐ Wake up!

41:47.142 --> 41:48.613
This is horrible.
