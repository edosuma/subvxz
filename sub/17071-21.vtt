"He's too young."

18:58.070 --> 18:59.606
But Mommy was like,

18:59.639 --> 19:01.508
"Young talent is good
for society."

19:01.541 --> 19:05.845
And the teacher was all,
"Ah! You convinced me!"

19:05.878 --> 19:07.314
Guess he does
still need you.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.483
Mommy was using debate tricks
there's not even names for.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.319
Then the class asked
if she could be our teacher,

19:12.352 --> 19:14.221
and she said,
"I hate teachers."

19:14.254 --> 19:15.222
Everyone loved her.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.357
She was like a superhero.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.563
Oh, my God, Eddie.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.065
The perfect superheroes are
right in front of us.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.102
Oh, damn.

Here is your debate team
exemption form,

19:34.241 --> 19:35.842
signed by your teacher.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.410
I'll put it
in your binder.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.379
No.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.913
It belongs in yours.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.258
Here you go.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.460
**

19:59.532 --> 20:01.501
Waste of time.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.769
This is junk.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.205
Let's see this now.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.012
Oh!

20:13.045 --> 20:16.883
By the golden hammer of Thor!

20:16.916 --> 20:18.751
Look at this!

20:18.785 --> 20:19.719
Wow.

looking for!
