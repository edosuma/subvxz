00:11.720 --> 00:13.513
<i>In the life of a teenage girl,</i>

00:13.596 --> 00:16.599
<i>there is no greater hell</i>
<i>than waiting for a boy to text you.</i>

00:16.683 --> 00:18.101
Come on. Come on.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.395
<i>Hey, is my phone working?</i>

00:23.398 --> 00:24.274
Ugh!

00:24.357 --> 00:27.610
<i>Especially when there were</i>
<i>so many reasons why he should text.</i>

00:28.194 --> 00:29.988
<i>Like you'd been cute together.</i>

00:30.071 --> 00:31.573
<i>You had great chemistry.</i>

00:32.073 --> 00:33.158
<i>Also, there was this.</i>

00:33.241 --> 00:34.451
Well, um…

00:34.534 --> 00:36.077
Can I text you sometime?

00:36.745 --> 00:40.665
<i>So for that little punk</i>
<i>to send nothing was pretty frickin' rude.</i>

00:46.296 --> 00:50.341
<i>Teenage boys, however,</i>
<i>aren't really known for their manners.</i>

00:50.425 --> 00:53.845
<i>So sadly, it looks like Devi</i>
<i>was being straight-up ghosted.</i>

00:53.928 --> 00:55.722
<i> Or was she?</i>

00:57.015 --> 00:58.516
<i>Yes. Yes, she was.</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:02.937
<i>Come on, stupid wildfire,</i>
<i>read the room.</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:12.614
Mmm… I don't know, guys. I don't think
I'm gonna hear back from him.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.200
Unless my phone isn't working.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.118
-It's working.
-It's definitely working.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.495
Right. Yep.

01:18.578 --> 01:23.166
Man. I thought we had a spark,
but I guess I was wrong.

01:23.249 --> 01:27.796
I mean, Des was a Palisades ten
with a legit social life, and I'm like a--

01:27.879 --> 01:31.216
-Sherman Oaks eight with two friends.
-I did not need that chime in, Fab.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.133
Sorry.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.011
At least I got to flirt a little.
It's been a while since I did that.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.971
Maybe that's the problem.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.808
Maybe your vibe's gotten dusty,

01:39.891 --> 01:41.768
like when you don't drive a car
for a few months.

01:41.851 --> 01:42.769
What are you talkin' about?

01:42.852 --> 01:45.480
People can tell when someone
hasn't hooked up in a while.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.107
Your aura gets all cobwebby,

01:47.190 --> 01:49.776
and you turn invisible
to potential lovers.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.736
Take Mrs. Paloma for example.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.031
Shit. I didn't even see her there.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.450
Like I said, totally invisible.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.202
I can hear you guys.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.871
And for your information,
I am very happily married,

02:01.955 --> 02:04.040
even though we sleep in separate bedrooms.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.792
-Sorry, Mrs. Paloma.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.171
Anyway, I think I've made my point.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.464
Yep. So, what do I do?

02:11.548 --> 02:13.967
You just have to kiss someone,
like, anyone.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.887
Morning. Picking up
on some juicy girl talk. What did I miss?

02:17.971 --> 02:21.099
Just talking about how weird stuff gets
when you haven't kissed in a long time.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.185
Oh. Right.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.646
In Devi's life. Not in anyone else's life.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.442
So, how do I kiss someone?

02:31.526 --> 02:34.154
You should do it
at the drama club's coffeehouse tonight.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.239
It's the sexiest night of the year.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.782
We all dress kind of French,

02:37.866 --> 02:39.909
and the maintenance staff
turns the lights down low,

02:39.993 --> 02:42.495
and everyone sneaks off
into the classrooms to make out.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.706
Also, it's for charity.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.375
We're raising money
to help climate refugees learn improv.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.087
Yes, and the ocean's dying.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.047
<i>Maybe Eleanor was right.</i>

02:53.131 --> 02:55.216
<i>Maybe Des hadn't texted Devi</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:58.011
<i>because her vibes</i>
<i>were covered in dust bunnies.</i>

02:58.094 --> 03:01.848
<i>Perhaps mouth-to-mouth resuscitation</i>
<i>was just what she needed.</i>

03:01.931 --> 03:05.059
Yep. Let's do this. I'm gonna kiss someone
at the coffeehouse.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.899
Okay, Mr. Hall-Yoshida.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.860
Did you have a chance to make that list
of colleges you want to apply to?

03:13.943 --> 03:15.570
Where is Ms. Warner?

03:15.653 --> 03:18.489
Our college counselor
is hiking the Pacific Crest Trail

03:18.573 --> 03:19.824
after a bad breakup.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.993
So I will be
temporarily filling in for her

03:22.076 --> 03:25.079
because I definitely have the time
to work an extra job.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.249
-Okay. Well, these are my top choices.
-Oh.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.169
This is a good mix
of safeties and targets.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.880
Mmm, some are a bit out of reach.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.590
But my grades are good now.

03:35.673 --> 03:38.593
You know, colleges are looking
for well-rounded students.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.720
Grades aside,
with you not swimming anymore,

03:40.803 --> 03:42.222
you don't have any extracurriculars.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.015
Trent and I tried to start
a beer pong team,

03:44.098 --> 03:45.266
but you said it was illegal.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.144
I stand by that.
Are there any clubs you can join?

03:48.853 --> 03:51.648
I don't--
Clubs are kind of for dorks.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.484
-Okay. What about community service?
-Mmm…

03:54.567 --> 03:58.363
FYI, if you say community service
is for dorks, that makes you a bad person.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.156
Fine. What do you want me to do?

04:00.240 --> 04:03.076
Like, clean up a beach
or sing to an old person.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.536
In the interest of time,
maybe start with something here.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.081
The drama club is hosting
a charity coffeehouse tonight.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.625
-Why not volunteer for that?
-All right.

04:13.294 --> 04:17.131
So, does that mean I have to,
like, talk to the drama club kids?

04:21.094 --> 04:23.972
Okay. See you later, Mom.
Gotta go to a quick charity thing so--

04:24.055 --> 04:27.684
Dressed like a streetwalker?
Nope. No, no, no. Stay right there.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.060
-Put this on.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.063
This is <i>Pati's</i> Costco sweater.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.899
The pockets are filled
with used sample cups.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.862
Oh, are you moving out tonight?
We just started being nice to each other.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.783
-I've always been nice to you.
-Which is what makes this so much harder.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.327
-Come here.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.415
Okay, you'll have to give me
a copy of your key, so I can visit you

04:50.498 --> 04:53.042
and have my friends over
whenever you're at work.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.210
To study.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.130
If you'd like to study, Devi,
you can do it in this beautiful home

04:57.213 --> 04:59.299
I've worked my entire life
to provide for you.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.925
Okay, fine. Jeez, Mom.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.262
I'll miss you, Kamala. Bye.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.392
Kamala, come on.
This is really, really unnecessary.

05:09.475 --> 05:14.397
Your grandmother's-- She's stubborn,
but she will soften over time.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.317
Twenty years later, do you see
how much eye contact she makes with me?

05:17.400 --> 05:21.821
I understand, but I need to figure out
what's happening with Manish on my own.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.531
You can figure it out here.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.784
Just keep it really, really, really secret
until your grandmother dies.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.412
That probably isn't that far away.
Her mother only lived till--

05:30.079 --> 05:33.249
Oh, yeah, right.
Her mother's still alive. She's 104.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.502
Listen, I know that <i>Pati </i>might be
the initial reason for my move,

05:36.586 --> 05:38.713
but I'm actually excited
to live on my own.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.090
Well, if I can't talk you out of it…

05:41.174 --> 05:43.051
…at least let me help you move.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.931
<i>Devi arrived</i>
<i>at Eleanor's coffeehouse</i>

05:49.015 --> 05:51.017
<i>very clear on the mission at hand.</i>

05:51.559 --> 05:55.730
<i>She was gonna find a cute boy</i>
<i>and suck the face right off of him.</i>

05:55.813 --> 05:57.106
<i>Consensually, of course.</i>

05:57.190 --> 05:58.441
Hi!

05:58.524 --> 06:01.277
Dang, dude. The student lounge
is looking straight up <i>romantique</i>.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.570
I know, right?

06:02.653 --> 06:06.407
It was inspired by an erotic dream I had
about the <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.451
So, how do I do this kiss thing?

06:08.534 --> 06:12.205
I mean, I can't just go up to someone
and be like, "Nice mouth. Can I kiss it?"

06:12.288 --> 06:13.706
Wait. Can I? Was that cool?

06:13.790 --> 06:17.543
Do whatever feels natural, but also do it
while you're waiting tables.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.878
-What?
-Sorry.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.755
When it was time to assign jobs,

06:20.838 --> 06:24.550
none of the drama club kids
wanted to do anything but perform.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.886
So I had to ask
all our friends to work here.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.388
Oh, okay.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.431
Thank you.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.814
Hey, can I get you guys something?

06:37.897 --> 06:41.984
I know looking at you makes me thirsty
for a tall drink of water.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.570
Good God, Devi,
that was pathetic.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.281
Are you the charity
we're raising money for tonight?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.495
What the hell? You just cockblocked me.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.164
-You can't cockblock someone--
-Fine, you clam jammed me.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.916
<i> Never heard that one before.</i>

06:56.999 --> 06:59.502
What are you doing
aside from embarrassing yourself?

06:59.585 --> 07:01.546
Well, if you must know,

07:01.629 --> 07:05.883
Eleanor says I need to kiss someone
to make my sexual vibes less dusty.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.678
Mmm, yeah, I guess it has been
a while for you, huh?

07:08.761 --> 07:09.679
You're one to talk.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.640
How many people have you kissed
since Aneesa dumped your ass?

07:12.723 --> 07:13.933
Your dad doesn't count.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.726
Maybe I haven't hooked up in a while,

07:15.810 --> 07:18.312
but by choice,
not by circumstance like you.

07:18.396 --> 07:22.400
Mmm. Well, I bet
that I kiss someone tonight and you don't.

07:22.900 --> 07:26.404
Mmm, Devi. Sweet, simple, stupid Devi.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.948
Your mouth is writing a check
that your lips can't cash.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.325
But these babies are the whole damn bank.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.704
-You suck.
-Yeah, someone's face!

07:35.455 --> 07:37.415
Yeah. That was good.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.960
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.838
Paxton? What are you doing here?

07:43.921 --> 07:46.757
I told Eddie Tan I'm not interested
in getting <i>She's All That</i>-ed.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.844
What? No, I'm volunteering.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.263
Eleanor said I should
help you out back here in the…

07:53.139 --> 07:54.182
kitchen.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.808
Oh, well, okay.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.311
When someone orders coffee,
we pour some coffee into a cup.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.687
And when someone orders a cookie,

07:59.770 --> 08:01.481
we give them one
out of this Entenmann's box.

08:01.564 --> 08:06.068
Doesn't seem like you need two people
to do that, so I'll just chill over here.

08:06.944 --> 08:07.778
Thanks.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.908
Hey. Can I get two coffees for my table?

08:11.991 --> 08:12.950
Coming right up.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.787
So, how's the table waiting going?

08:16.871 --> 08:18.706
It's good.

08:18.789 --> 08:22.001
-How's the coffee pouring going?
-Good.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.754
Good. Okay.

08:25.963 --> 08:29.217
-Um, see you in a bit.
-Bye.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.847
-So you guys hooking up?
-What?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.182
No.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.936
Definitely not.
It's crazy you would say that.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.687
All right. Guess I was wrong.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.649
Yeah, you are wrong
because Aneesa and I are just friends.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.650
Okay.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.319
But just out of curiosity though,

08:48.402 --> 08:50.112
what would make you think
we were hooking up?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.990
I don't know. It seemed like you guys
were into each other.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.409
Really? She seemed
like she was into me too?

08:55.493 --> 08:56.536
What's happening here?

08:57.119 --> 09:00.039
Okay, so Aneesa and I did kiss.

09:00.122 --> 09:03.209
Like a million months ago.
But you can't tell anyone.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.544
Who would I tell?

09:05.461 --> 09:08.339
I don't know anyone
who would care about that information.

09:08.422 --> 09:12.260
I haven't even told Devi or Eleanor
because I don't want to out Aneesa,

09:12.343 --> 09:14.637
and I don't want to make
our friend group weird…

09:14.720 --> 09:17.890
…but you're the first person
to notice something. So what do you think?

09:17.974 --> 09:19.308
Why haven't you guys kissed again?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.603
I don't know. It's like
we've been hanging out all the time,

09:22.687 --> 09:24.939
and there's this weird tension between us,

09:25.022 --> 09:27.149
but neither one of us
will make the first move.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.943
So just make the first move then.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.904
I don't really know how to do that.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.657
I do.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.251
All right, David.
You picked out your victim yet?

09:45.334 --> 09:48.588
I've got my sights set
on flannel and denim at table three.

09:49.297 --> 09:53.175
Mmm, Damian and Lucas?
They're together. As in boyfriends.

09:54.385 --> 09:57.013
What about the third one?
He seems kind of straight.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.472
He's wearing a feather boa.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.725
I did not see that.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.393
David, let me save you some time.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.396
Most guys at drama club events are
either dragged here by their girlfriends

10:05.479 --> 10:07.106
or are looking for boyfriends.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.775
The only exception I see
is Alejandro over there.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.032
Damn it.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.241
If you want to call it quits,

10:17.325 --> 10:19.744
we can save you further embarrassment
and just say that I won.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.413
You didn't win.
You're doing just as badly as I am.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.415
That's because I haven't even tried yet.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.375
Drama club may not have
a lot of options for you,

10:26.459 --> 10:28.711
but I am swimming in possibilities.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.713
No one's hornier than a theater girl.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.758
Uh, look at them.
That whole table's wearing corsets.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.092
Whoa.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.762
All I have to do
to attract them is just pull up my hoodie

10:37.845 --> 10:39.305
and look a little tortured.

10:39.388 --> 10:42.099
Okay. Hey, give my gender a little credit.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.436
Ben, right? You seem like
you're really going through something.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.354
If you want to talk,

10:46.437 --> 10:49.815
my friends and I are just over there
practicing our British accents.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.987
Oh my God. Fine. You win.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.114
Go on over there and smooch away.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.450
Nah, I'm… I'm gonna wait.

10:59.533 --> 11:03.496
You know. Weigh my options.
You always throw out the first pancake.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.331
You are so cocky.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.624
This sucks.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.418
Tonight was supposed to be
my reintroduction into sexy society,

11:09.502 --> 11:13.255
but how am I supposed to break
my dry spell if I can't find anyone to--

11:17.635 --> 11:19.887
<i>What you are witnessing right now</i>

11:19.970 --> 11:22.598
<i>is a fairly common phenomenon</i>

11:22.682 --> 11:25.184
<i>that happens to almost every teen girl.</i>

11:25.267 --> 11:28.062
<i>It is the moment when an unremarkable dork</i>

11:28.145 --> 11:32.775
<i>is given a guitar and suddenly becomes</i>
<i>the hottest man in the world.</i>

11:32.858 --> 11:37.655
<i>Scientists call it the Ed Sheeran effect.</i>
<i>There is no known cure.</i>

11:37.738 --> 11:39.073
I know who I'm gonna kiss.

11:40.866 --> 11:45.329
Kamala, look at this place.
It's so soulless and bland.

11:45.413 --> 11:49.250
I was hoping for something a little bit
more funky eclectic like an Ace Hotel,

11:49.333 --> 11:52.294
but this is one of the only options
that came pre-furnished.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.046
You know what else is pre-furnished?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.965
My house and the room
you live in for free.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.342
-Auntie.
-What?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.511
Did you even take a look at the bathroom?

12:00.594 --> 12:02.805
It's carpeted.
It's really not very sanitary.

12:02.888 --> 12:06.183
If the worst part about this place is
that it's carpeted, I think I can deal.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.645
Hi, are you new here? I'm Kayley.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.439
-I live next door.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.734
Hello, I'm Kamala.
I'm so excited to be your neighbor.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.778
Maybe I'll come over and borrow
a cup of sugar from you sometime.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.531
I'm not allowed to have carbs.
Are you her momager?

12:20.614 --> 12:24.910
What is that? And…
And why are there so many children here?

12:24.994 --> 12:28.247
Everyone who lives at the Pinewoods
is either an aspiring child actor

12:28.330 --> 12:29.707
or a parent who has quit their job

12:29.790 --> 12:32.001
so that their child can provide
for the family instead.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.919
Mom, you don't sound
like a cop at all.

12:34.003 --> 12:37.173
How am I supposed to nail this audition
when you're giving me nothing?

12:37.256 --> 12:38.674
That's Cecilia.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.011
She's so talented, but her mom can be
a real dumb bitch sometimes.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.472
Okay, children. Thank you very much.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.475
Back to your parents
or whoever your legal guardians may be.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.310
-Come on, guys.
-Thank you very much.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.686
Thanks for visiting.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.815
You cannot live here.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.657
Hey! Great string work, Alejandro.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.785
I should know. I'm a harpist.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.204
Wow, the… the harp is very complicated.

13:08.287 --> 13:13.626
Yeah, it is. And I thought I should
let you know that I'm down to pluck.

13:13.709 --> 13:17.296
<i>I feel embarrassed for her,</i>
<i>but it does seem to be working on him.</i>

13:24.470 --> 13:26.305
Hey, want to take a walk with me?

13:26.388 --> 13:29.266
I am indeed most charmed, Mr. Gross.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.393
Right.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.274
All right.
What if you just asked her on a date?

13:37.358 --> 13:40.069
-Show me how you'd do that.
-Yep, yep, yep. Okay.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.116
Hey, Aneesa, would you like to go
to a restaurant, just the two of us?

13:47.284 --> 13:52.581
Or, uh, we can invite all of our friends,
or whatever you want to do.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.292
-Okay.
-Was it bad?

13:55.376 --> 13:56.210
Yeah.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.212
Because I mention
inviting our friend group?

13:58.295 --> 14:00.381
No. What you say doesn't matter.

14:00.464 --> 14:03.592
-How you say it is everything.
-Hmm.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.052
Watch.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.098
Hey, Aneesa.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.602
You wanna go out to a restaurant,
just the two of us?

14:14.311 --> 14:16.772
Or we can invite all of our friends.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.694
Whatever you want.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.490
Oh my God. I don't even like men,
and that worked for me.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.410
I know. Just use a lot of eye contact.

14:29.493 --> 14:33.497
Phoebe is a lucky girl.
Do you talk to her like this all the time?

14:33.581 --> 14:34.623
Um…

14:35.291 --> 14:38.961
Yeah. I mean, we don't really talk
all that much.

14:39.044 --> 14:39.879
We mostly…

14:40.421 --> 14:41.422
You know?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.757
But, um, maybe?

14:43.841 --> 14:45.175
Oh. Um…

14:45.259 --> 14:49.013
Sorry. That made my relationship
sound bad, but it's not.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.224
It's actually exactly
what I want right now.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.353
-To have a girlfriend you don't talk to?
-No, we do talk.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.438
I just mean,

14:58.230 --> 14:59.523
you know, simplicity.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.985
Like, I know she's your good friend,

15:03.068 --> 15:06.989
but Devi is really complicated.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.657
That is not untrue.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.243
Stuff with her was always so confusing.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.954
I just feel like it's my last year
of high school,

15:14.038 --> 15:19.501
and I want something that's easy,
and fun, and doesn't make my brain hurt.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.255
Well, then I hope Phoebe
is exactly what you're looking for.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.340
She is.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.257
Cool.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.843
Um, thank you for the tips.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.764
And may I say,
I am frightened by the powers you possess.

15:31.847 --> 15:32.765
Whew!

15:35.434 --> 15:38.479
So, unfortunately, my niece
can no longer take the apartment.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.772
So just give her deposit back.

15:39.855 --> 15:43.025
We'll be on our way,
and this gorgeous room will be available

15:43.108 --> 15:46.487
for whatever talented child
comes across it next.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.947
Why would you wanna leave? Okay?

15:48.030 --> 15:51.158
Some casting execs are coming by next week
to scout for <i>Young Sheldon's</i> new bully.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.911
Sir, I am not a child performer.

15:53.994 --> 15:54.954
I am an adult.

15:55.037 --> 15:58.040
Well, the Pinewoods has plenty
of adult performers as well, okay?

15:58.123 --> 16:01.293
But if you're gonna film in the room,
I do ask that you put down a tarp.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.252
Oh God.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.214
She is not staying. Just give us
the paperwork so we can leave.

16:05.297 --> 16:09.760
All right. You can get out of your lease.
But I'm keeping the deposit.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.221
No, no, no, no.
That was my first month, last month,

16:12.304 --> 16:13.555
and three months in the middle.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.058
-That's… That's all my money.
-That's all your money.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.644
Well, you should consider
being an adult performer then.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.108
Ow. Did you just bite my tongue?

16:24.191 --> 16:28.696
Yeah, I'm a little bit wicked.
Are you scared?

16:28.779 --> 16:30.280
I can safely say I am.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.283
Stella! You're on next.

16:34.410 --> 16:38.497
My art calls. Maybe I'll see you later,
and I can bite something else.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.083
No, thank you.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.422
For the record,
I was not into any of that.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.424
No judgment here. You do you.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.927
Wait, Aneesa. Look, I know
that we haven't talked much in a while,

16:52.011 --> 16:55.264
and this is certainly
a bizarre interaction to get us chatting,

16:55.347 --> 16:56.890
but I owe you an apology.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.893
Fabiola told me I was a real douchebag
to you when we were together--

16:59.977 --> 17:01.437
Fabiola said that to you?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.523
Yeah. Right after she made me barf.
Don't worry about it.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.984
Anyways, I'm really sorry.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.194
I appreciate the apology.

17:09.278 --> 17:13.032
It must have been hard to say
with your tongue all bitten up.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.660
-So, uh, you and Stella pretty serious?

17:16.744 --> 17:19.538
-Do I hear wedding bells?
-No, I don't think so.

17:19.621 --> 17:23.417
Plus, I think she's already in
a committed relationship with the night.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.794
-What about you? Are you seeing anyone?

17:25.878 --> 17:28.172
Nah, not really.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.008
I mean, there might be someone.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.509
Oh, really? Who?

17:32.593 --> 17:33.886
Just a friend.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.055
I really liked your song.
It was really nice.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.264
Thank you.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.932
Let me give you some advice.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.726
Do not fall for a friend.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.603
Even if it feels
like a good idea at the time,

17:42.686 --> 17:45.105
you are just setting yourself up
to be miserable.

17:48.442 --> 17:52.613
Ben, you're in no position to give me
romantic advice about anything, okay?

17:52.696 --> 17:56.617
-Okay. I was just trying to help.
-You did. You showed me what <i>not</i> to do.

18:00.829 --> 18:04.083
<i>Devi had stolen away</i>
<i>with her angel-voiced crooner,</i>

18:04.166 --> 18:06.960
<i>and now there was</i>
<i>only one thing left to do.</i>

18:07.044 --> 18:09.254
There's something about tonight,
don't you think?

18:09.338 --> 18:12.174
Maybe it's the smell of Sumatra dark roast

18:12.257 --> 18:13.675
or just the electricity.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.469
Can I kiss you?

18:16.220 --> 18:17.304
I would love that.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.815
<i>Yikes. Those lights</i>
<i>are certainly illuminating.</i>

18:27.898 --> 18:29.733
Okay, that's it.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.236
Everyone stop making out.
The coffeehouse is closed.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.322
This is a school.
Not the red-light district.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.616
Ugh.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.410
Oh, yeah, that pairing makes sense to me.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.790
So, do you want to be my girlfriend now?

18:44.873 --> 18:47.501
Full disclosure,
I do not believe in monogamy.

18:47.584 --> 18:51.338
And I'm already in serious relationships
with several avatars in the virtual world.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.967
Alejandro, let's not spoil tonight

18:55.050 --> 18:57.386
by trying
to shackle ourselves with commitment.

18:58.595 --> 19:02.683
Time to go, you little perverts.
Don't make me turn the sprinklers on.

19:03.892 --> 19:07.104
Paxton, hey,
how'd your first community service go?

19:07.187 --> 19:09.148
Hopefully,
it won't be your last, right?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.983
No, it won't be my last.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.235
-Hi, you wanna head out with me?
-Yeah.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.738
-I actually liked helping out.
-That's fantastic.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.867
It's good to know tonight broadened
at least one student's horizons

19:19.950 --> 19:22.035
and wasn't just some
school-sanctioned orgy.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.748
Were y'all fooling around in the chem lab?

19:26.832 --> 19:28.667
Come on now, that's just nasty.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.840
Hey, having a good night?

19:34.923 --> 19:37.009
Yeah, I actually am.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.051
Looks like it.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.845
Every time I see you these days,

19:39.928 --> 19:41.763
you're like chillin'
with a different dude.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.182
Are you, like, a player now?

19:43.265 --> 19:47.144
Basically. Oh, are you worried
that I'm going to steal your thunder?

19:47.227 --> 19:49.188
Mmm, little bit. Little bit.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.397
Mmm.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.984
So look, I'm sorry
about the last time we spoke,

19:54.067 --> 19:56.737
that I thought you would care
about me being with Phoebe.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.740
You've obviously way moved on.

20:00.657 --> 20:05.245
Yeah. Wait, I am so sorry.
What's your name again? Paxil?

20:05.329 --> 20:07.414
-Damn, she's cold.
-Mm-hmm.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.583
All right.
I'll see you around, heartbreaker.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.629
<i>And with that,</i>
<i>Devi knew for certain</i>

20:13.712 --> 20:15.631
<i>her vibes had already changed.</i>

20:17.424 --> 20:18.592
I'm trapped here.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.220
I can't lose that money.
I'm such an idiot.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.346
You're not an idiot.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.806
I just wanted to prove
that I could be independent,

20:24.890 --> 20:27.768
and now I'm stuck living here
at this creepy Hollywood orphanage.

20:27.851 --> 20:31.355
Maybe <i>Pati</i> was right.
Maybe I can't make decisions for myself.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.148
What if I'm wrong about Manish too?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.233
Kamala.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.027
You're a brilliant young woman

20:37.110 --> 20:39.488
who is perfectly capable
of making decisions for yourself.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.990
Sure, this apartment is far from perfect,

20:42.074 --> 20:44.409
and your neighbors remind me
of the children in horror films.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.663
I think they are the children
in horror films. Like, literally.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.583
But you're right.
You need to stand on your own.

20:52.292 --> 20:55.504
Have I ever told you about
the first apartment Mohan and I lived in?

20:55.587 --> 20:57.631
Our toilet was next to the refrigerator,

20:57.714 --> 20:59.800
and our upstairs neighbor
was the 210 Freeway.

20:59.883 --> 21:04.388
Wow, that explains why you need
such a loud alarm to wake you up.

21:05.722 --> 21:06.682
You can do this.

21:07.766 --> 21:08.850
You mean stay here?

21:08.934 --> 21:11.395
Mm-hmm. I think it'll be good for you.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.106
At the very least, it'll be a fun tale
to one day tell your children.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.315
And…

21:17.025 --> 21:20.821
you can always come home for dinner
whenever you need to get away.

21:22.155 --> 21:25.659
Hey. If you're interested,
Cecilia stole one of her mom's beers,

21:25.742 --> 21:28.745
and we're gonna drink it in the hot tub
with the boy band from 5C.

21:29.579 --> 21:30.998
Can I come home for dinner tonight?

21:31.790 --> 21:33.125
Yes, I think you should.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.677
Aneesa, I need to tell you something.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.389
Should we like date?

21:47.973 --> 21:49.766
I think we like each other, right?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.936
Should we be more than friends?

21:54.646 --> 21:56.815
Yeah. I-I'm down for that.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.859
Really?

22:00.736 --> 22:01.570
Cool.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.327
Wow, eye contact is for real.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.749
So, do I look
a little less invisible to you now?

22:15.125 --> 22:17.919
No way. You kissed someone? Who?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.087
It doesn't matter.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.923
All that matters is that I'm back
to being a person who bangs.

22:22.007 --> 22:22.841
Lips onto lips.

22:22.924 --> 22:26.511
Yay. OMG, tonight was amazing,

22:26.595 --> 22:29.598
and maybe you were off
with your mystery man,

22:29.681 --> 22:33.393
but did you notice how many girls
were, like, fawning over Alejandro?

22:33.477 --> 22:34.853
I mean, he's a beautiful singer,

22:34.936 --> 22:37.230
but I really hope
no one hooked up with him

22:37.314 --> 22:39.900
because he had, like, a super bad cold.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.777
All day. Like ultra-phlegmy.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.322
Hey.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.783
Oh.

22:48.658 --> 22:49.493
How'd it go?

22:49.576 --> 22:50.827
Pretty great.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.747
You're looking at someone
who's done some kissing this evening.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.540
Mmm. Well, so are you.

22:55.624 --> 22:56.625
Oh.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.086
<i>Devi,</i>
<i>you seem a little jealous there.</i>

23:00.003 --> 23:02.255
-Was it drama girl?
-Yep.

23:02.339 --> 23:06.218
Well, look at us.
Two people sucking faces and taking names.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.678
Yeah. I guess so.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.140
All right, I should go. Good night, Ben.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.308
Good night, Devi.
