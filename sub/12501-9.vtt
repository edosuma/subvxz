00:02.510 --> 00:04.111
Woody, I have the
results of your colonoscopy.

00:04.180 --> 00:07.081
Be honest, doc.
Do I have the ass cancer?

00:07.149 --> 00:09.349
I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Woody.

00:09.418 --> 00:13.067
- I found something alarming in there.
- No!

00:13.723 --> 00:17.941
- Oh, yeah, I accidentally sat on that.
- Really? These too?

00:18.027 --> 00:19.977
Looks like somebody fell
ass-first into a yard sale.

00:20.062 --> 00:24.198
I just like to be organized.
I call it bung-shui.

00:24.266 --> 00:26.176
Besides some mild
tearing and what I swear

00:26.177 --> 00:28.086
was an oompa loompa that
I was never quite able

00:28.087 --> 00:29.103
to get a hold of, you're all clear.

00:29.171 --> 00:31.338
Great. Now, if you'll kindly

00:31.407 --> 00:33.640
return those things to
my ass, I'll be on my way.

00:33.709 --> 00:35.008
Oh, Woody, you're
still under the influence

00:35.077 --> 00:37.778
of the anesthetic. I can't
let you drive yourself home.

00:37.847 --> 00:39.413
I gave you a bunch
of emergency contacts.

00:39.482 --> 00:42.549
- Didn't you call 'em?
- Yes. I got four wrong numbers,

00:42.618 --> 00:44.151
three hang-ups, and
a "[bleep] my mother."

00:44.220 --> 00:46.220
She's been dead for three years,
so that would be difficult,

00:46.288 --> 00:49.757
- but not impossible.
- Okay. So what does this mean?

00:49.825 --> 00:51.625
Medically speaking?
Well, you have no friends.

00:51.694 --> 00:53.627
And since there's no
one here to pick you up,

00:53.696 --> 00:54.645
I'm going to have to put you down.

00:54.730 --> 00:56.930
Wait, wait!
Can't I just call a cab?

00:56.982 --> 00:58.649
Hmm, I never thought of that.

00:58.734 --> 01:01.235
Guess I didn't need to put all
those people down after all.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.669
Boy, is my face red.

01:02.738 --> 01:04.438
Kidding! I can't feel emotion.

01:04.507 --> 01:06.173
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

01:06.242 --> 01:08.342
Tommy! Shut up and
play your trombone!

Wow, your chest hair
really does look like

01:26.152 --> 01:28.586
- burnt taco meat.
- I told you.

01:28.654 --> 01:30.154
My pubies looks like cheese curls.

01:30.239 --> 01:34.208
Oh, wait, these are cheese curls!

01:34.293 --> 01:35.292
Oh, wait. They're not.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.661
Ugh!
You guys are making me hungry.

01:38.247 --> 01:42.166
Hi, I'm looking for the
"hairy, horny, hung virgin."

01:42.251 --> 01:44.051
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh,
boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

01:44.136 --> 01:45.669
Shut up, Connie.
She's here for me.

01:45.888 --> 01:48.739
You're a bear? You never
mentioned that you were a bear.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.407
- You lied to me?
- Lied?

01:50.476 --> 01:52.209
You answered an ad on craigslist.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.043
You're lucky I'm not murdering you.

01:53.112 --> 01:57.982
- Well, we're not having sex.
- Murder it is.

01:58.050 --> 02:01.018
Malloy can't get laid!

02:01.070 --> 02:03.687
Steve has rabies!

02:03.773 --> 02:05.022
No, I...

02:05.074 --> 02:07.691
Wait a second, that's weird.

02:07.777 --> 02:08.859
Malloy, bite him again.

02:08.945 --> 02:10.661
- But harder this time.
- What?

02:12.164 --> 02:15.065
Yay! Let's eat each other!
Dibs on Ethel.

02:15.134 --> 02:18.085
Hmm, fascinating.

02:19.205 --> 02:22.089
Malloy, you have four incisors.

02:22.174 --> 02:24.208
And you have dick on your breath.

02:24.293 --> 02:27.055
- Do you know what that means?
- Your dad's in town?

02:27.090 --> 02:29.930
No, it means you're
a rare breed of bear.

02:30.016 --> 02:30.915
You may even be the last one alive.

02:30.983 --> 02:33.673
<i>Ursus loquacious.</i>

02:33.708 --> 02:35.986
Ursus Loquacious?
He plays for the Falcons.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.555
Ah! Why the hell

02:37.640 --> 02:39.723
did you all give me
fake contact numbers?

02:39.775 --> 02:41.058
Some friends you are.

02:41.110 --> 02:43.671
- Friends? We don't even like you.
- Huh? Why?

02:43.706 --> 02:47.898
- Simple. You're an asshole.
- That's not true, bitch. Ow!

02:47.950 --> 02:50.401
Woody, can I get a new uniform?

02:50.453 --> 02:52.922
- I outgrew another one.
- [bleep] you, lard ass.

02:52.957 --> 02:54.262
I'm not buying you another uniform!

02:54.297 --> 02:55.906
Lose some weight or better
yet, blow your brains out,

02:55.992 --> 02:57.541
you fat tub of monkey shit!

02:57.577 --> 03:00.461
Honestly now, you guys
really think I'm an asshole?

03:02.248 --> 03:04.815
Oh, I can't believe
I don't have any friends.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.483
Nobody gets me.

03:06.552 --> 03:07.918
<i>Both: One shot of Goldschlager.</i>

03:07.970 --> 03:11.889
I thought I was the only
one who enjoyed Goldschlager.

03:11.924 --> 03:14.425
You kidding? This is the finest
gold-flecked schnapps

03:14.510 --> 03:16.143
that money can buy
for under $12 a bottle.

03:16.228 --> 03:19.396
One night, I drank
so much of this stuff,

03:19.432 --> 03:24.268
I panned my diarrhea and I made $80.

03:24.337 --> 03:27.705
That might be the most
awesome thing I've ever heard.

03:27.773 --> 03:29.506
Mayor Todd Ford.

03:29.575 --> 03:33.027
- The crackhead mayor of Hazelhurst?
- Ah, don't believe the media.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.412
They just gave me that nickname

03:35.481 --> 03:39.216
- because I smoke crack all the time.
- Woody Johnson.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.218
The whore-punching
head ranger of Brickleberry?

03:41.287 --> 03:45.348
And they say you can't
give yourself a nickname.

03:45.369 --> 03:48.844
Barkeep, another round!

03:49.228 --> 03:53.464
My friend said he
wanted another drink!

03:53.516 --> 03:56.166
Oh, shit! You better chill out
before he calls the cops!

03:56.235 --> 04:01.021
I'm mayor.
The cops work for me.

04:01.107 --> 04:01.939
Drinks are on the house!

04:04.143 --> 04:07.645
To the start of a
beautiful friendship!

04:19.492 --> 04:21.875
Yeah!

04:24.830 --> 04:26.747
<i>Help! Help!</i>

04:38.094 --> 04:40.177
Malloy, I have amazing news.

04:40.262 --> 04:42.230
- I did some research and found out...
- You're not actually

04:42.231 --> 04:42.980
the last of your species.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.015
Turns out there's one
more, and it's a female!

04:45.084 --> 04:48.736
- Way to step on my dick, Connie.
- Sorry.

04:48.737 --> 04:51.013
I'm having the bear flown
into the Brickleberry wildlife

04:51.014 --> 04:53.290
sanctuary so you
can continue the species.

04:53.359 --> 04:54.792
Let me check to see if I give a shit.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.720
- I don't.
- You know what this means?

04:57.029 --> 04:58.829
- It means...
- You get to have sex with her!

04:58.898 --> 05:01.031
And not just once, as
much as you possibly can.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.301
- God dammit, Connie!
- Sorry!

05:04.370 --> 05:06.070
Interesting.
Tell me more about this

05:06.138 --> 05:09.573
"having sex as much as I possibly can."

05:09.642 --> 05:11.575
All right. Oh, but
first there's a complex

05:11.644 --> 05:13.043
mating ritual that you're
gonna have to learn.

05:13.112 --> 05:15.546
Okay, now,
you circle around her seven

05:15.547 --> 05:17.981
times, and her labia
will become engorged.

05:18.050 --> 05:21.885
- Check.
- This is the worst furry party, ever.

05:21.954 --> 05:23.521
And then you begin to growl and

05:23.522 --> 05:25.089
cup the buttocks of the female...

05:28.094 --> 05:31.261
I think I just lost my
deposit on this bear suit.

05:32.448 --> 05:36.383
I don't get it, Denzel.
How do you stay so thin?

05:36.452 --> 05:38.452
I burn a lot of calories having sex.

05:38.521 --> 05:41.889
- Does it work if it's with yourself?
- No.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.676
I don't have friends
'cause I'm an asshole, huh?

05:45.761 --> 05:47.845
See what you know, I made a friend

05:47.846 --> 05:49.930
who's a bigger asshole than me!

05:50.016 --> 05:52.399
- Daniel Tosh?
- Who? Never heard of him.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.985
No, my B.F.F. is the
coolest guy on the planet:

05:55.071 --> 05:56.737
Mayor Todd Ford.

05:56.772 --> 05:59.106
Really, Woody?
He's a corrupt drug addict.

05:59.191 --> 06:03.243
- He's not a drug addict.
- I got the drugs!

06:03.312 --> 06:04.511
Whoo!
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!

06:04.580 --> 06:06.594
We've gotta keep this
meth off the street.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.544
I'm all right.

06:16.092 --> 06:20.761
He's fine, I had to do
this three times last night.

06:22.765 --> 06:25.633
I feel awesome!
Did I die again?

06:25.685 --> 06:28.135
"Did I die again?"
I love this guy!

06:28.187 --> 06:29.470
Makes me want to be mayor.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.638
So, what are we doing tonight?

06:30.690 --> 06:33.357
Ooh, yeah, me and some
high-powered friends

06:33.442 --> 06:35.643
are playing poker, but
it might be a little

06:35.695 --> 06:36.810
too high-stakes for you.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.713
You kidding?
High-stakes is my middle name.

06:39.782 --> 06:41.849
All right, Woody, if you insist!

06:41.917 --> 06:43.701
We're going to party tonight!

06:43.786 --> 06:44.952
<i>Both: Oh yeah! Yeah!</i>

06:44.987 --> 06:46.468
<i>- Whoo!
- Yeah...</i>

06:48.991 --> 06:51.326
Now remember, the continuation of

06:51.327 --> 06:53.661
your entire species depends on this.

06:53.713 --> 06:56.330
Here we go.
Let the banging begin.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.734
Hello.

07:00.803 --> 07:04.338
Nope. No way.
I am not [bleep]ing that.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.223
You can't leave.
Your species depends on

07:06.308 --> 07:07.725
the two of you mating.

07:07.810 --> 07:09.727
Yeah, Malloy, she's not that bad.

07:09.812 --> 07:11.512
Oh yeah, she looks like a movie star.

07:11.597 --> 07:17.618
Steve Buscemi's eyes and
the teeth of... Steve Buscemi.

07:19.555 --> 07:21.989
God dammit! I fold.

07:22.058 --> 07:23.691
Ha! Ha! Ooh yeah!

07:23.759 --> 07:26.560
I haven't seen this
many unnecessary folds

07:26.629 --> 07:28.929
since I binge-watched
season one of Girls.

07:28.998 --> 07:30.731
Ha ha!

07:30.800 --> 07:32.566
So, you're a bit of a hunter, eh, Ford?

07:32.635 --> 07:35.253
I do love big game hunting. It's too bad

07:35.254 --> 07:37.871
there's no good place
to do it around here.

07:37.940 --> 07:40.974
Yeah, [bleep]ing Obama, putting
all the good animals in Africa.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.042
Anyway, thanks for
inviting me and letting me

07:42.111 --> 07:44.211
take all your money, fellas.

07:44.263 --> 07:48.298
And you, Bruce Jenner.
You are either a very ugly man,

07:48.384 --> 07:51.785
- or a very attractive woman.
- Thank you.

07:51.854 --> 07:54.755
Actually, Bruce lost
a lot of poker games.

07:54.824 --> 07:57.458
The first bet was "wear
this dress," and then it was

07:57.526 --> 08:00.994
"take these estrogen pills,"
and so on and so on.

08:01.063 --> 08:04.565
Would you care to make this hand
a little more interesting, Woody?

08:06.108 --> 08:09.910
Yes! Yes! I mean...
Eh, maybe.

08:09.979 --> 08:11.178
What do you have in mind?

08:11.247 --> 08:13.080
Well, I know your
dream job is to be mayor.

08:13.149 --> 08:17.117
How about, if you win,
you get to be mayor.

08:17.186 --> 08:20.254
If I win,
I get control of Brickleberry.

08:20.323 --> 08:22.423
Oh, I don't know.

08:22.491 --> 08:25.092
What's the matter, Woody?
Got no balls?

08:25.161 --> 08:28.228
You want to borrow mine?
They're in a dumpster in Glendale.

08:28.297 --> 08:30.497
So, Woody, are you
going to take the bet,

08:30.566 --> 08:33.167
or are you not man
enough to be my friend?

08:33.235 --> 08:36.470
All right, I'm in!
Four aces.

08:36.539 --> 08:38.839
That's an impressive hand.
But does it beat my...

08:38.908 --> 08:42.659
- straight flush?!
- Oh, shit.

08:42.745 --> 08:44.878
I lost the park to a straight flush!

08:44.947 --> 08:48.449
Cry me a river.
I lost my dick to a pair of queens!

08:48.534 --> 08:51.159
Hello!
We have names, you know.

08:55.699 --> 08:57.365
One. Whew!

08:57.450 --> 09:00.902
Okay, I jumped the rope,
I did half a sit-up.

09:00.971 --> 09:02.103
Why can't I lose weight?

09:02.172 --> 09:03.671
All I've been eating
are these rice cakes.

09:03.740 --> 09:06.497
Those are rice
krispie treats, dumbass.

09:06.498 --> 09:07.600
Morning, rangers!

09:07.677 --> 09:10.889
So, I got a little
overextended last night and, uh,

09:10.924 --> 09:12.881
lost the park to the
mayor in a poker game.

09:12.966 --> 09:14.599
- Moving on.
- You what?!

09:14.684 --> 09:17.051
Don't judge me. I had four aces.

09:17.103 --> 09:19.270
All of you would've done
exactly the same thing,

09:19.356 --> 09:20.471
so this is as much your
fault as it is mine.

09:20.557 --> 09:23.925
See, Woody, this is
why no one likes you.

09:23.994 --> 09:26.494
You think that's why
no one likes him? Ha!

09:26.563 --> 09:28.813
Oh, don't worry about it.
The park will be fine.

09:28.899 --> 09:30.231
Nothing's going to change.

09:46.216 --> 09:49.468
It's going to be so much more convenient

09:49.469 --> 09:52.720
to hunt them all in our own backyard.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.613
Well, this is great.
All these wild animals

10:01.614 --> 10:04.499
are going to be a huge
draw for the tourists.

10:04.661 --> 10:07.852
Uh, Woody, the animals
are eating the tourists.

10:09.906 --> 10:12.011
I just thought of a great
way for you to lose weight.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.984
- Really?
- It's called running as fast

10:13.985 --> 10:15.526
as you mother[bleep]ing can!

10:19.616 --> 10:21.616
Worst case scenario,
they rip your leg off.

10:21.701 --> 10:23.334
That's still losin' weight!

10:23.420 --> 10:25.086
<i>Thanks, buddy!</i>

10:25.121 --> 10:27.121
Woody, what are you
going to do about this?

10:27.190 --> 10:30.110
Hmm, would you accept
"[bleep] you" as an answer?

10:30.109 --> 10:33.181
- No?
- Fine! I'll go talk to the mayor.

10:36.933 --> 10:39.350
Oh, no, Bobby.
Rhinoceroseses!

10:39.436 --> 10:41.469
I told you we shouldn't
have played Jumanji!

10:44.858 --> 10:46.140
Listen, Fordles, can we talk?

10:46.192 --> 10:49.377
Uh, some of the other
rangers... not me, of course...

10:49.446 --> 10:51.346
think the animals you flew into the park

10:51.414 --> 10:54.478
are destroying the place.
Crazy, right?

10:54.513 --> 10:57.685
Tell them I'm calling the
shots at Brickleberry now.

10:57.754 --> 11:02.741
If it gets destroyed, so be it,
as long as I get to hunt down

11:02.776 --> 11:07.662
and kill those animals
the only way a man should...

11:07.747 --> 11:11.499
High on crack!

11:11.584 --> 11:13.775
Yeah, but why do you have
to do it at Brickleberry?

11:13.810 --> 11:16.971
Well, it beats going to Africa.
I hate flying.

11:17.007 --> 11:19.223
And skinny kids with
fat bellies scare me.

11:19.309 --> 11:20.258
I know, right?

11:20.343 --> 11:22.910
Pick a body type, you
fat skinny bastards.

11:22.979 --> 11:25.747
I'm just lucky you picked
up those two aces on the draw.

11:25.815 --> 11:29.100
Yeah, if only I'd...
how'd you know I picked up

11:29.185 --> 11:31.069
two aces on the draw?

11:31.154 --> 11:32.898
Wait a second. You cheated!

11:32.933 --> 11:36.858
Oh, no. A politician who cheats?
What's next?

11:36.926 --> 11:40.549
An eskimo that [bleeps] coconuts?

11:40.964 --> 11:45.834
- Sorry, I'm very high.
- But... But we're best friends.

11:45.869 --> 11:48.903
We're not friends!
You're an asshole!

11:48.972 --> 11:52.974
I played you like a bitch just
to get my hands on that park.

11:53.043 --> 11:54.275
This means war!

11:54.344 --> 11:56.844
You are now a sworn
enemy of Woody Johnson.

11:56.913 --> 11:59.480
Unless you want to start over
and try to be friends again?

11:59.549 --> 12:03.952
- No, I don't.
- Jesus, who wrote this shit?

12:04.220 --> 12:09.058
- And then, he could [bleep] a coconut!
- Hello, Emmy!

12:10.143 --> 12:12.977
- Come on out, Mallory.
- Don't be shy.

12:13.063 --> 12:15.063
I know what it's
like to be the ugly one.

12:15.115 --> 12:16.197
But it gets better.

12:16.232 --> 12:18.933
It doesn't get any better.

12:24.074 --> 12:25.406
I can work with this.

12:48.398 --> 12:50.598
Ethel, Connie, gotta say, nice work.

12:50.650 --> 12:52.100
I actually have half a chub here.

12:52.152 --> 12:56.521
So, Mallory, you've been quiet.
Tell me something about yourself.

12:56.606 --> 12:58.439
Be yourself, Mallory.

12:58.525 --> 13:00.992
Wanna take this
train to [bleep] town?

13:01.077 --> 13:03.749
- I'm sorry?
- Can I taste yo juice?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.530
I'm not even sure
what we're talking about.

13:05.615 --> 13:07.949
I want to punch you in the b-hole.

13:08.001 --> 13:11.619
All right. And the word
of the day is "extinction."

13:11.704 --> 13:15.338
Hang me upside down
and speed bag my tits!

13:16.876 --> 13:18.926
Oh, my best friend betrayed
me, and I have no way

13:18.962 --> 13:21.129
of getting my park back.

13:21.214 --> 13:23.765
- What do I do, Malloy?
- I got my own problems.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.684
Some cock-eyed woodchuck wants
me to punch her in the b-hole.

13:26.770 --> 13:28.352
No wonder I'm the last of my species.

13:28.438 --> 13:29.971
That's it!
You're a genius, Malloy.

13:30.039 --> 13:32.707
No, but I still
make Steve look dumber

13:32.776 --> 13:34.175
than a sack of dry shit.

13:36.446 --> 13:38.000
"Sack."

13:38.698 --> 13:40.314
Malloy, why'd you run off?

13:40.400 --> 13:42.150
I thought you and Mallory
had a real moment there.

13:42.235 --> 13:43.551
What moment was that?

13:43.620 --> 13:45.720
When she asked me to
fist fight her lady lips?

13:45.789 --> 13:49.624
Yeah, that was [bleep] hot.
Mmm.

13:49.659 --> 13:52.043
Malloy, you have a responsibility
to continue your kind.

13:52.128 --> 13:55.329
- You have to have sex with her.
- I'd rather die.

13:55.381 --> 13:57.248
Then you leave me no choice.

13:57.333 --> 14:01.052
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! I wasn't serious!

14:01.137 --> 14:05.640
Aw, what a cute little coma.
What are you doing?

14:05.708 --> 14:08.709
I was able to extract an
egg from Mallory last night.

14:08.778 --> 14:11.679
Now I just need to get Malloy's
sperm and I can fertilize it.

14:11.748 --> 14:14.266
It's okay, Ethel. Just
close your eyes and pretend

14:14.267 --> 14:16.784
you're tugging your way out
of another speeding ticket.

14:19.622 --> 14:22.623
- Connie, I got the semen!
- Yeah, it's about time.

14:22.692 --> 14:24.826
I got tired of watching after two hours.

14:24.894 --> 14:27.428
Yeah, whiskey dick's nothing
compared to tranq spank.

14:27.497 --> 14:29.030
Pretty sure I have carpal tunnel now,

14:29.098 --> 14:30.832
but you know what, it was worth it.

14:36.439 --> 14:38.539
Steve! You gained ten pounds!

14:38.608 --> 14:41.209
Damn it!
I'll never fit in this uniform.

14:41.277 --> 14:42.891
Looks like diet and
exercise aren't your thing.

14:42.926 --> 14:44.434
We need to try something new.

14:44.469 --> 14:47.548
But I've tried everything.
Not even liposuction worked!

14:49.452 --> 14:53.137
I can't believe you were going
to throw this out. It's delicious!

14:55.525 --> 14:56.524
Where are you taking me?

14:56.559 --> 14:58.860
I was having the best tug job dream.

14:58.895 --> 15:02.063
You're going to help me
save this park. Now be quiet.

15:05.268 --> 15:08.486
Well, mayor, I guess you
really tickled his ivories.

15:08.571 --> 15:09.987
What do you want, Woody?

15:10.073 --> 15:12.073
Well, I thought you might be
interested in a little wager,

15:12.125 --> 15:15.076
since you call yourself a betting man.

15:15.161 --> 15:17.211
What could you
possibly have that I want?

15:17.280 --> 15:19.914
I've already taken everything from you.

15:19.966 --> 15:22.016
Oh, not everything.
Look at these gums.

15:22.085 --> 15:27.089
- What is this, roots?
- Oh my god! Ursus loquacious!

15:27.090 --> 15:32.627
The rarest animal on the
planet, the holy grail.

15:32.695 --> 15:34.979
Here's the bet.
I'll let you hunt Malloy...

15:35.064 --> 15:37.598
- What?!
- but only for one hour.

15:37.684 --> 15:39.767
If you can't kill him,
I get my park back.

15:39.819 --> 15:41.936
Can we think of a plan
that doesn't involve my death?

15:42.021 --> 15:43.404
Nah, too much trouble.

15:43.473 --> 15:46.941
- The hunt starts at noon tomorrow.
- You got a deal.

15:47.026 --> 15:49.277
Get ready to mount that rhino.

15:49.362 --> 15:53.963
Get in line. Oh, I like
these exotic women.

15:57.022 --> 16:01.658
Ugh!
This diet is making me hungry.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.730
I don't know who See-mon is,
but I'm eating his yogurt.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.799
Mmm-mmm!

16:08.867 --> 16:10.917
It's got a kick to it!

16:11.003 --> 16:11.835
Steve, what the
[bleep] are you doing?

16:11.870 --> 16:15.272
I know!
I'm cheating on my diet.

16:15.341 --> 16:18.508
Cheating on your diet?
You eating bear jizz!

16:18.577 --> 16:20.711
Oh, my god!

16:20.879 --> 16:22.746
Oh, my god!

16:23.688 --> 16:27.150
Why would See-mon write his
name on a cup of bear jizz?

16:31.357 --> 16:33.256
Steve, do you feel okay?

16:33.325 --> 16:36.126
Uh, just got a hold
of some bad yogurt.

16:36.195 --> 16:37.494
I'm trying not to think about it.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.039
Wanna split my tapioca pudding?

16:40.934 --> 16:42.631
You could've just said "no."

16:42.901 --> 16:46.870
So Woody's big plan
is to sacrifice "my life"

16:46.905 --> 16:48.655
to get his stupid park back.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.074
Cubsy wubs, there's no way
daddy's gonna let you die.

16:51.143 --> 16:52.209
I've got it all planned out.

16:52.277 --> 16:55.412
What? My funeral?
Eat my jizz, Woody.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.247
Shut up!

16:57.333 --> 16:59.800
First, I'm going use bear
tracks to lure Mayor Ford

16:59.885 --> 17:02.636
to the Brickleberry briar
patch where stage one

17:02.721 --> 17:04.421
of my plot begins...

17:04.473 --> 17:08.558
<i>and that brings us to
little ol' stage 238:</i>

17:08.594 --> 17:12.979
Batman'll come swinging in
and say... "Justice!"

17:13.065 --> 17:16.066
So as long as we do this all
before noon, you'll be fine.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.234
Uh, it's 12:45.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.538
You see, that's why I need
an alarm clock in my ass!

17:21.607 --> 17:23.941
Wow, Malloy!
I didn't know you were in

17:23.942 --> 17:25.909
- the triple nipple club too.
- Oh, crap! Move!

17:29.181 --> 17:31.582
I'm outta here.
Great plan, Woody.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.817
Where are you going?
It's dangerous out there.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.452
It's dangerous in here.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.522
And if I'm gonna die, I'm
not gonna die a virgin.

17:38.591 --> 17:42.613
Hey! Someone spilled bleach
in my warm salted mayonnaise.

17:42.653 --> 17:45.684
- You smell it, Steve?
- That's so specifi...

17:47.492 --> 17:49.266
<i>Run!</i>

17:50.903 --> 17:53.412
There's not much time.
We have to make love.

17:53.413 --> 17:55.032
Shit, yeah, we do.

17:55.067 --> 17:59.105
Oh, it's time to serve up
some panny pudding.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.311
No.

18:01.380 --> 18:05.440
Oh, hell, you gonna tape me
up before you split these guts?

18:05.475 --> 18:08.214
That gets my ovaries clapping and

18:08.215 --> 18:10.954
my bung hole flapping 'cause...

18:11.006 --> 18:13.524
All right.
Let's get this over with.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.759
Come out, little bear.
This won't hurt much.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.695
It's just a little genocide.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.301
I've got you now.

18:24.386 --> 18:26.870
Nothing like killing an
animal at his moment of climax.

18:26.939 --> 18:32.476
Don't you shoot my bear!

18:32.528 --> 18:35.946
Noooo!

18:35.981 --> 18:38.198
I wish I knew what it
was like to lose a child.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.785
- Khloe?
- Yeah, Khloe. I hate that hairy ape.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.201
Malloy, you were my best friend.
I loved you.

18:48.287 --> 18:50.342
Why did I try to
find a new friend when

18:50.343 --> 18:52.398
my true friend was
right here, and now my

18:52.399 --> 18:54.925
fake friend killed my only friend?

18:56.043 --> 18:57.844
Jesus, you're a pussy.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.380
But if you're here
calling me a pussy...

19:00.449 --> 19:02.582
Who is...
What is...?

19:02.901 --> 19:06.803
Ew, god dammit, that's ugly.
Why the hell is she wearing a strap-on?

19:06.872 --> 19:10.440
Had to save my ass
by giving up my ass.

19:10.509 --> 19:12.979
Yeah, I'm the only
kinky freak around here.

19:13.014 --> 19:16.779
1:00 on the dot.
You lose, Woody.

19:16.814 --> 19:19.249
The deal was you had to
kill Malloy within one hour.

19:19.318 --> 19:22.019
You killed another bear
who was way too ugly

19:22.020 --> 19:24.721
- to live anyway.
- I'll give you this much, Woody.

19:24.790 --> 19:27.290
You sure know how to get lucky.

19:27.359 --> 19:32.329
- The park is yours.
- I beat you, you son of a bitch!

19:32.414 --> 19:33.830
Hey, Woody.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.833
Well look who finally
decided to show up... Batman.

19:36.885 --> 19:41.338
- You do know that's not Batman, right?
- I think I know Batman.

19:41.423 --> 19:44.307
He's been sneaking in my
window and fingering my bat cave

19:44.343 --> 19:47.143
- ever since I was a little boy.
- Hmph.

19:48.947 --> 19:51.715
Today I learned a valuable
lesson about friendship.

19:51.783 --> 19:53.950
It is better not to have any friends,

19:54.019 --> 19:56.152
so I'm just going to
continue being an asshole.

19:56.221 --> 19:58.588
Oh, and I also learned that
some guy dressed in a Batman suit

19:58.657 --> 20:01.758
- molested me as a child.
- Now that Mallory's gone,

20:01.827 --> 20:03.360
I'm pretty excited to be
the last of my species.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.128
People will pay big money to see me!

20:05.197 --> 20:08.256
Well, you're not
exactly the last, Malloy.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.784
Thanks to the artificial
bear womb I got on Skymall,

20:10.869 --> 20:13.086
Malloy's child will be born any second.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.572
Ooh, I'm going to be a grandfather!

20:15.640 --> 20:18.875
Uh, Woody, can I get
a smaller ranger uniform?

20:18.960 --> 20:20.844
This one doesn't fit me anymore.

20:20.879 --> 20:23.540
Oh, Jesus. What the
hell happened to you?

20:23.575 --> 20:24.714
What do you got all, the aids?

20:24.766 --> 20:28.793
No. I've been throwing up every day
since I ate Malloy's semen.

20:28.828 --> 20:29.886
You did what?!

20:29.938 --> 20:33.056
Don't worry, I knew you'd
be mad, so I replaced it

20:33.141 --> 20:35.418
- with my semen.
- Oh, my god.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.040
Kill me!

20:45.712 --> 20:51.082
Got the only one.
I am a god now.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.017
Uh, that's definitely for the best.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.653
I [bleep] love that guy.
