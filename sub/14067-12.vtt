NARRATOR:<i> Previously on </i>Boston Legal...

00:02.460 --> 00:05.088
-What the hell is this?
-It says the firm is going broke.

00:05.171 --> 00:06.047
The firm is going broke?

00:06.131 --> 00:07.549
Did I know this and forget?

00:07.632 --> 00:08.967
You're in the early stages of Alzheimer's.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.635
We're not talking
about precursors anymore.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.388
There's a drug called Dimebolin.
Something like that.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.181
You can't have it. It's not FDA-approved.

00:15.265 --> 00:18.560
Even a dying patient
has no constitutional right

00:18.643 --> 00:19.519
to experimental treatment.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.646
-So now what?
-We go to the State Supreme Court.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.189
-They said no.
-Any appeal?

00:23.273 --> 00:24.816
Well, to the U.S. Supreme Court.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.985
-Will you marry me?
-I would love to marry you.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.903
-We're going back to the Supreme Court!
-Oh!

00:28.987 --> 00:31.364
-Supreme Court!
-BOTH: Supreme Court! Supreme Court!

00:32.073 --> 00:37.120
(instrumental version
of "Deck the Halls" playing)

00:43.793 --> 00:44.753
(elevator bell dings)

00:49.382 --> 00:50.508
Ah, what's up?

00:50.717 --> 00:52.469
All I know is they've reached
a tentative deal,

00:52.552 --> 00:54.512
-and they need us to sign off before--
-We merged?

00:54.596 --> 00:57.307
-Evidently. We'll know more in a second.
-Where are we going?

00:57.807 --> 00:58.933
Twenty-eighth floor.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.685
-They're all waiting.
-Who?

01:01.686 --> 01:04.189
Where's... Where's Edwin?
Doesn't he have to sign off?

01:04.272 --> 01:05.607
I'm told he was called.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.359
What does this mean to us,
or specifically, me?

01:08.443 --> 01:11.321
I don't know the details, Denny.
Let's just hear what they have to say.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.405
What the hell is this?

01:12.489 --> 01:13.907
(people chattering)

01:13.990 --> 01:15.700
Shirley Schmidt and Denny Crane.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.953
I'd like you to meet Hyung Lee
and Zhu Chang.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.039
-Hello.
-They're all Chinese.

01:21.122 --> 01:27.253
Denny, Mr. Chang is the CEO
of the Tsu Chang International Group.

01:27.629 --> 01:31.216
They've recently acquired Finlay Crevette,
a law firm you know well.

01:31.508 --> 01:36.012
They are now expanding to acquire
Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.848
What are you talking about?

01:38.932 --> 01:40.683
I thought we were merging with Finlay?

01:40.767 --> 01:43.853
Yes, Finlay is now really
Tsu International.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.563
Any of you yahoos speak English?

01:45.647 --> 01:47.899
-I speak English, Mr. Crane.
-Oh, good for you.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.317
Who are these guys?

01:49.400 --> 01:53.363
Denny, your abrupt litigation style
is legendary.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.032
You need not put it on display.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.535
Are you telling me we're being bought out
by the Chinese?

01:58.618 --> 01:59.744
Uh, the good news is,

01:59.828 --> 02:02.831
they intend to keep on
most of the attorneys here,

02:02.914 --> 02:04.582
so as transitions go--

02:04.666 --> 02:07.710
Yeah, I've seen their transitions
in Tibet. I'm not a fan.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.963
We're not selling out
to a bunch of commies.

02:10.046 --> 02:11.339
-Denny--
-How dare you?

02:11.422 --> 02:12.799
DENNY:
What, you're not a bunch of commies?

02:12.882 --> 02:15.051
You're not getting my firm.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.221
(overlapping dialog)

02:18.304 --> 02:19.222
What? What?

02:19.305 --> 02:21.724
War talk? Bring it on.

02:22.725 --> 02:25.395
-DENNY: Oh, really?
-(overlapping dialog)

02:29.482 --> 02:30.733
PAUL: Denny!

02:31.568 --> 02:32.402
Denny!

02:32.694 --> 02:34.362
(men clamoring)

02:36.364 --> 02:38.700
PAUL: Denny! Denny!

02:39.909 --> 02:41.202
-Ooh!
-Oh.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.290
(theme music playing)

02:46.875 --> 02:48.251
<i>♪ Uh-huh ♪</i>

02:52.088 --> 02:53.298
Boom.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.008
<i>♪ Come on ♪</i>

02:56.843 --> 02:57.760

02:59.470 --> 03:00.680

03:00.763 --> 03:01.806

03:11.191 --> 03:12.859

03:20.658 --> 03:24.621
(sighs) I think I managed
to smooth things over.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.122
This deal...

03:27.999 --> 03:30.752
Paul, why didn't you tell me
who you were negotiating with?

03:32.003 --> 03:34.422
It's an extremely reputable group,
Shirley,

03:34.505 --> 03:37.091
not to mention liquid,
which, in this economy--

03:37.175 --> 03:38.593
It's Chinese.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.430
Do you know how many businesses
in this country

03:42.513 --> 03:43.806
are owned and operated by--

03:43.890 --> 03:45.475
We don't have to be one of them.

03:46.184 --> 03:50.396
Shirley, we don't have any other bidders.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.524
We have about three weeks
before we can't make payroll--

03:54.067 --> 03:54.901
Paul...

03:56.861 --> 03:58.071
this firm is my legacy.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.322
My name is on the plaque.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.825
And I don't have to remind you
of China's track record in human rights.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.037
You're talking about the government.
This is a private company.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.622
There have to be alternatives.

04:08.706 --> 04:09.540
There aren't.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.918
(cell phone ringing)

04:17.507 --> 04:19.550
-(keypad beeps)
-Shirley Schmidt.

04:21.761 --> 04:22.762
What?

04:24.555 --> 04:25.556
What's the address?

04:28.977 --> 04:31.604
-Okay. Thank you.
-(keypad beeps)

04:33.314 --> 04:34.440
Denny's been arrested.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.192
What?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.529
It's one o'clock in the morning.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.784
(sighs)

04:45.451 --> 04:48.037
(siren wailing)

04:49.330 --> 04:51.082
(dog barking)

04:52.917 --> 04:55.044
-(police radio chatter)
-Here we go.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.722
(indistinct chattering)

05:05.805 --> 05:07.181
Shirley Schmidt and Paul Lewis.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.309
And we represent Denny Crane.
Where is he?

05:09.934 --> 05:12.061
-The den.
-What happened?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.439
He broke in and sexually assaulted
the woman who resides here.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.024
-What?
-Sexually assaulted her?

05:16.107 --> 05:17.900
He climbed into her bed
while she was sleeping.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.945
She broke free, called us.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.115
-SHIRLEY: Denny.
-I called Alan.

05:24.991 --> 05:25.825
Couldn't get him.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.454
-Denny, what... what have you done?
-Well, this is just a misunderstanding.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.914
This is, uh, Penelope Kimball's house.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.043
She's a friend, a neighbor.
We have a kinda flirty relationship.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.754
I... I thought I'd give her
a Christmas surprise.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.547
I surprised her too much, I guess.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.007
You climbed into her bed?

05:41.090 --> 05:44.218
Well, I thought she'd like it.
We have a kind of chemistry.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.595
Not anymore, you don't.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.932
Well, couldn't I just apologize to her
and go home?

05:50.266 --> 05:51.976
SHIRLEY:
I don't think it's going to be that easy.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.438
You're being charged with breaking
and entering and sexual assault.

05:55.521 --> 05:59.108
Oh, please.
Who do I make the check out to?

05:59.192 --> 06:03.029
Denny, you are in serious trouble here.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.546
Are you kidding me?

06:21.464 --> 06:24.342
-Oh, please. Everybody's overreacting.
-Overreacting?

06:24.425 --> 06:26.969
You broke into a woman's house
in the middle of the night,

06:27.053 --> 06:28.596
climbing into her bed naked?

06:28.679 --> 06:30.390
-Well, I do that all the time.
-Denny--

06:30.640 --> 06:31.724
Look, I didn't break in.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.476
The kitchen door was open. She's a friend.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.811
And as for being naked,

06:34.894 --> 06:36.979
I... I thought I was saving
a little time. (chuckles)

06:37.730 --> 06:41.401
Look, the last time she and I spoke,
we talked about Christmas

06:41.484 --> 06:43.069
and the gifts and the economy,

06:43.152 --> 06:46.406
and I said, "This year,
I'm going as the little drummer boy.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.659
Instead of presents, I'm gonna show up
and play my little instrument."

06:49.742 --> 06:51.536
She said, "Oh, I'd like that."

06:51.619 --> 06:55.873
And I mistook that
for an invitation of sorts. Sorry.

06:55.957 --> 07:00.044
Denny, we are scheduled to go
before the Supreme Court on Friday.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.712
Alan, we got bigger problems than that.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.631
-What?
-We're being bought...

07:04.132 --> 07:07.552
(whispering)
We are being bought out by the Chinese.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.387
What are you talking about?

07:09.470 --> 07:11.139
(in normal voice)
It's very hush-hush, but I'm telling you,

07:11.222 --> 07:15.059
a Chinese company has reached
an agreement in principle to buy us.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.020
This place, last night,
was crawling with Chinese.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.730
Ho Chi Minh City, I kid you not.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.442
Why would a Chinese company wanna buy
an American law firm?

07:22.775 --> 07:23.943
They're buying everything.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.905
They're taking over.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.368
Listen, how... how could you have not
been kept in the loop on this?

07:32.452 --> 07:35.955
I was told they were a parent company
of Finlay. I had no idea.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.959
-Carl, I wanna stop it.
-Well, can we?

07:40.418 --> 07:42.795
The only think I can think of
is an injunction,

07:43.212 --> 07:46.090
trying to block it
on public policy grounds.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.258
Public policy?

07:47.341 --> 07:50.761
Well, it can't be a good thing
for Chinese corporations

07:50.845 --> 07:52.805
to be scooping up American law firms.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.516
It's definitely not good for us.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.936
Well, all in all, we picked
a really bad week to get married.

07:59.020 --> 07:59.854
(chuckles)

08:00.313 --> 08:02.940
Ms. Schmidt, I'm Penelope Kimball.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.068
We didn't actually get to meet last night.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.405
No, I-- The--
Carl Sack, this is Penelope Kimball.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.325
She was the victim of Denny's.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.202
-Ah.
-SHIRLEY: Last night. Please sit.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.789
You know, I feel really, really terrible
about all of this.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.583
Well, we all do.

08:21.375 --> 08:26.506
Um, Denny's maintaining
it was some sort of misunderstanding.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.758
Is that possible?

08:29.592 --> 08:34.096
Denny didn't seem to understand
anything last night.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.389
What do you mean?

08:35.806 --> 08:39.936
He seemed extremely disoriented
and confused.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.270
It... It wasn't...

08:42.688 --> 08:46.108
It didn't seem like an assault of any kind
so much as...

08:47.527 --> 08:50.279
He seemed really, really confused,

08:50.655 --> 08:54.200
like he didn't really know where he was.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.042
That's ridiculous.

09:03.459 --> 09:07.463
I was in Penelope Kimball's bed
looking to play my instrument.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.883
She's a very sexy lady. You should be glad
I didn't climb into yours.

09:10.967 --> 09:14.053
-Denny, there's no point in lying to us.
-I am<i> not.</i>

09:15.429 --> 09:17.306
Denny, look at me.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.561
Tell me what happened last night.

09:22.853 --> 09:23.771
I told you already.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.107
Denny... (clicks tongue)

09:30.861 --> 09:32.405
(voice breaking)
I don't know what happened.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.120
All of a sudden, the police were there.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.706
I was in the wrong house...

09:43.124 --> 09:44.458
And I wasn't wearing anything.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.795
I don't know what happened.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.967
I remember being upset at home.
I... I couldn't sleep.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.094
I was so worried
about the Communist invasion.

09:57.471 --> 10:03.185
Next thing, I'm naked
and I'm talking to police officers.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.230
I don't even remember talking to Penelope.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.488
-I want that drug.
-We go to the Supreme Court on Friday.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.174
The question becomes,

10:33.257 --> 10:36.177
if they refused to hear
almost exactly the same case before,

10:36.260 --> 10:37.970
why are they suddenly doing so now?

10:38.262 --> 10:39.096
I don't know.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.183
It's a bit daunting,
being in a room with them,

10:42.516 --> 10:44.977
even when they're just cutout posters.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.229
-How are we doing?
-(Jerry clears throat)

10:47.313 --> 10:51.067
Well, there's no constitutional right
to experimental treatment.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.818
We're gonna have to locate
authority elsewhere.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.987
What about right to privacy?
Can we extend by analysis?

10:55.071 --> 10:57.657
You can, but it's been tried before
and rejected.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.367
Medical self-defense?

10:59.450 --> 11:03.287
Also tried with marijuana
for medicinal purposes, also rejected.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.372
What<i> have </i>you got?

11:05.998 --> 11:07.667
(clicks tongue) We're still looking.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.505
Alan, there are rumors about the firm
being sold.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.590
I don't have time for rumors
right now, Jerry.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.427
-(blows a raspberry)
-(door closes)

11:19.929 --> 11:22.056
Look, Shirley, no one likes it.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.141
Why can't you get a line of credit
to make payroll?

11:24.225 --> 11:27.061
Line of credit? Have you been living
on this planet? Credit?

11:27.144 --> 11:30.773
-We have assets into the millions.
-And liabilities in the tens of millions.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.483
So you just make a deal with the devil?

11:32.566 --> 11:34.193
-That's the way you--
-PAUL: They are not the Devil.

11:34.276 --> 11:35.236
Yes, they are.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.029
-What, because they're Chinese?
-Yes.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.280
You're a bigot.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.241
(scoffs) I'm entitled to my opinion.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.076
I realize I wouldn't be
if I were in China.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.285
You are out of line.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.079
Paul, if this merger goes through,
I will--

11:45.162 --> 11:46.622
You can make your case to the partners.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.708
I will take my name off the firm, Paul.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.794
Your name is firm property.
You do not own it.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.921
-I'll go to court.
-PAUL: Fine.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.090
I'll wave to you from the other side.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.134
-Paul--
-(door slams)

12:08.644 --> 12:09.645
I spoke to the D.A.,

12:09.729 --> 12:11.731
and they're dropping the charges
against you.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.107
-(bottle cap opens)
-How did you do that?

12:13.190 --> 12:14.567
ALAN: Well, it wasn't difficult, really.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.819
Penelope also spoke to them, so...

12:17.236 --> 12:20.364
Oh. Deep down, that woman wants me.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.658
Do not go there tonight.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.828
-(sighs)
-Thank you, Alan.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.583
Alan, I wanna ask you something,
and, uh, you may think this is crazy,

12:30.666 --> 12:32.168
but I want you to think about it.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.335
Okay.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.470
(chuckles)

12:45.973 --> 12:46.974
Will you marry me?

12:48.392 --> 12:50.436
(stammering) I know the sex is lousy,

12:50.519 --> 12:55.357
but it's legal in Massachusetts,
same-sex marriage.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.904
And there are going to be decisions ahead,
medical decisions,

13:00.321 --> 13:04.074
that a spouse gets to make
if I should become--

13:04.158 --> 13:08.496
Denny, you can stipulate that
in a living will or by proxy.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.914
We don't need to get married.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.624
There are other reasons.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.293
Last night, I... I climbed
into a neighbor's bed,

13:14.627 --> 13:17.171
and I shot a few Chinese,
although I don't apologize for that.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.381
-How many times have I been arrested?
-A lot.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.926
And the odds on my getting arrested again
for who knows what...

13:23.969 --> 13:27.389
-I need to be able to tell you things.
-But you can always--

13:27.473 --> 13:29.141
No, let... let me finish first.

13:30.184 --> 13:33.229
Although I know you'd resist,
the police could subpoena you

13:33.312 --> 13:36.649
and try and force you to reveal
whatever I tell you.

13:36.732 --> 13:37.650
I'd never--

13:37.733 --> 13:40.444
You'd could be held in contempt
if you refuse.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.071
You could end up in jail.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.573
On the other hand,
if you had spousal privilege...

13:44.657 --> 13:45.491
(scoffs)

13:45.866 --> 13:49.745
I could talk to you without worrying
about you incriminating yourself later.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.122
-Denny--
-For my peace of mind...

13:53.749 --> 13:55.751
What little piece I have left.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.919
Let's be serious.

13:57.002 --> 14:00.089
And I can transfer property to you
without paying gift tax. (chuckles)

14:00.172 --> 14:02.091
And since the rate is 100 percent--

14:02.174 --> 14:06.095
Denny, what we've got now is so great.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.557
Why ruin it with marriage?

14:11.350 --> 14:14.061
-Who knows how long I have left?
-You have a long time left.

14:14.144 --> 14:17.857
We're going to the Supreme Court
and we're getting you that drug.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.406
-Seymore?
-Aye.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.825
-PAUL: Zinberg?
-Aye.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.952
-PAUL: Kennedy?
-Aye.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.162
-PAUL: Underwood?
-Aye.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.456
-PAUL: Evans?
-Aye.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.834
-PAUL: Smith?
-Nay.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.420
-PAUL: Xavier?
-Aye.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.923
-PAUL: Espenson?
-(mouth pops) Nay.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.010
-PAUL: Adams?
-Aye.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.804
-PAUL: Reid?
-Nay.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.056
-PAUL: Thomason?
-Aye.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.475
-PAUL: Sack?
-Nay.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.853
-PAUL: Schmidt?
-Nay.

14:56.854 --> 15:02.109
Okay, we've got 21 ayes and six nays.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.444
The nays have it.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.116
-The motion to approve the merger--
-The nays have it.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.247
-The merger has been approved.
-I'll get an injunction.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.253
We can get injunctions
on our own, Shirley.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.421
Take your shot, Paul.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.633
Shirley, there are many ways to go out.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.677
On your ass isn't one of the better ones.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.598
You might keep that in mind, Paul.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.785
(men speaking in foreign language)

15:58.707 --> 16:01.168
(men screaming)

16:03.295 --> 16:04.505
Denny, come on.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.717
-You for this merger, Carl?
-No. But this is a bit of a duress sale.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.262
We don't want assistants and secretaries
losing their homes.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.014
God forbid you should have to sell
your Gulfstream.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.058
-Shirley going to court?
-She is.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.726
-I'm coming with.
-Well--

16:17.810 --> 16:18.686
My name is on the door, too.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.730
Understood, but we have to present
a rational front.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.648
(gunshot)

16:25.484 --> 16:26.610
Give it to me.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.159
Okay, thank you.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.667
Am I not supposed to see you
before the big day?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.794
(chuckles) You're not the groom.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.046
Still time. (chuckles)

16:47.214 --> 16:48.632
I'm coming with you to fight the Chinese.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.511
-Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
-Shirley, my absence will be conspicuous.

16:52.594 --> 16:53.679
And much appreciated by all, since--

16:53.762 --> 16:58.350
I won't shoot anybody.
I... I'll keep my clothes on. I'll...

16:58.976 --> 17:01.603
-Well, I won't shoot anybody.
-Denny, I can't take the risk.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.523
Shirley, I'll behave.
I belong at your side.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.734
I'm a name partner.

17:08.736 --> 17:09.820
God, you're beautiful.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.114
Thank you.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.161
I'm gonna pack my trial bag.

17:21.582 --> 17:25.711
(men speaking in foreign language)

17:28.047 --> 17:29.381
(men screaming)

17:31.300 --> 17:32.843
(overlapping dialog)

17:34.011 --> 17:35.471
(panting) Yes!

17:36.138 --> 17:39.016
-Yes!
-Don't tell me. You love Katie.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.977
A federal case in Newark
recently granted a plaintiff

17:42.061 --> 17:43.771
the right to use an experimental drug.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.647
It's the most recent case on point.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.566
I found it. Katie helped.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.944
It's not binding, but it could explain
why the Supreme Court agreed to hear us.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.988
-A new case?
-I found it.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.656
Katie helped. (mouth pops)

18:01.497 --> 18:03.207
New case. I found it.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.921
(elevator bell dings)

18:25.562 --> 18:26.480
Wait a second.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.900
You're here representing
Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.151
And you're here...

18:31.235 --> 18:33.112
Also representing Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.115
And I would remind the court, I'm Schmidt.

18:36.198 --> 18:41.411
Your Honor, the partnership voted
overwhelmingly to approve this merger.

18:41.495 --> 18:45.165
It is lawful. It is pursuant
to a valid partnership agreement

18:45.624 --> 18:47.835
entered into by Ms. Schmidt.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.670
And it is against public policy.

18:49.753 --> 18:53.549
Why? To have a business acquired
by Chinese interests?

18:54.049 --> 18:57.636
You're a little late on the protest wagon
if that's what you're talking about.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.555
Your Honor, it is one thing
for them to acquire

18:59.638 --> 19:01.807
manufacturing and software companies.

19:01.890 --> 19:05.060
It's quite another to allow them
to have a death grip

19:05.144 --> 19:07.354
-on our law firms, which--
-Death grip?

19:07.437 --> 19:10.107
Which are in the business of safeguarding
our individual liberties--

19:10.190 --> 19:12.359
-Hey, Counsel.
-This does not scare you?

19:12.442 --> 19:13.277
Shame on you.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.612
JUDGE FUDD: Hold on. The law is the law.

19:15.696 --> 19:20.284
If the Chinese buy companies here,
well, they have to play by our rules.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.536
And if they don't wanna play by our rules,

19:22.619 --> 19:26.039
what more effective, insidious way
to circumvent our laws

19:26.123 --> 19:28.542
than to gain control
of America's law firms?

19:28.625 --> 19:31.587
-Your Honor, this is just outrageous.
-May I finish?

19:31.795 --> 19:32.629
Shirley...

19:40.053 --> 19:44.975
China is a lovely country.
I've always wanted to visit their walls.

19:45.684 --> 19:50.105
But the idea of China coming here
is terrifying.

19:50.189 --> 19:54.818
I'm sorry.
Their record on human rights is atrocious.

19:54.902 --> 19:59.740
They do not support freedom of speech,
freedom of religion.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.450
They do support Sudan,

20:01.533 --> 20:05.621
which enables them to contribute
to the genocide in Darfur.

20:06.121 --> 20:09.458
They turn a blind eye
to female infanticide,

20:09.541 --> 20:12.294
they force abortion,
they practice torture.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.256
China's economy will overtake ours.
That's not even a question.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.508
They have so much money invested here now.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.220
Uh, add to that the devaluation
of our dollar,

20:21.303 --> 20:23.263
they practically own us already.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.849
Their goal is to become
a civilizational power,

20:25.933 --> 20:29.937
and they have the wealth to achieve that.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.232
Let them buy up all our lawyers...
(chuckles)

20:33.315 --> 20:34.191
and watch out.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.109
I do not wanna fall into their hands.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.321
And by the way, it is folly to think
we will control them with our laws.

20:39.404 --> 20:43.116
It is ludicrous to think we'll be tough
on their human rights violations

20:43.200 --> 20:44.660
because we haven't been.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.119
And why? (chuckles)

20:46.203 --> 20:47.913
Because they own us.

20:48.288 --> 20:52.251
As Hillary Clinton said,
"How do you get tough with your banker?"

21:00.842 --> 21:04.680
I... I understand that the United States

21:04.763 --> 21:07.933
may end up working for China one day.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.311
I get that. It's a new world order.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.276
But as far as law firms go...

21:20.320 --> 21:22.030
(voice breaking) my name is on this one.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.410
My life's work has been to build up...

21:31.665 --> 21:33.500
Let them start with someone else's firm.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.094
(sighs)

21:52.227 --> 21:54.771
-Did he rule?
-After lunch.

21:55.689 --> 21:56.690
And suppose we lose?

21:56.773 --> 22:00.319
Has anybody made it clear
how the firm might change?

22:00.402 --> 22:03.905
Well, Paul Lewiston says it won't.
Shirley is convinced otherwise.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.033
Jerry was hopping around.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.994
-Ah.
-Said he found a new case on point.

22:09.077 --> 22:14.207
There was a recent federal court ruling
in support of giving experimental drugs.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.961
District Court, so it won't be binding,
but it'll help.

22:18.378 --> 22:22.591
I'm also presently trying to get you into
one of the clinical trials for dimebolin,

22:22.674 --> 22:25.010
but I'm not confident of that, Denny.

22:26.470 --> 22:29.681
Have you given any more thought
to my idea?

22:30.223 --> 22:31.558
What idea?

22:32.601 --> 22:33.435
Marrying you.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.855
We're committed to each other.

22:38.231 --> 22:39.274
Let's make it legal.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.904
I didn't mean to get emotional.
It's just...

22:45.155 --> 22:48.116
Maybe it's a bad sign
that my personal legacy

22:48.200 --> 22:50.911
is so tied to my profession instead of...

22:53.246 --> 22:56.083
I hardly ever talk to my daughter.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.002
I don't to my sister.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.338
We could always start a family.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.589
(laughs)

23:03.799 --> 23:06.927
Shirley, are you the least bit excited
about getting married?

23:07.344 --> 23:10.430
Well, of course I am.
Why would you ask that?

23:10.514 --> 23:13.517
Ah, I mean, most brides are obsessed
with their wedding day.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.435
Well, please, I've had too many of them.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.980
I... I didn't mean for it
to sound that way. Uh...

23:19.398 --> 23:22.275
-Do you wanna postpone the ceremony?
-No, no.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.486
-Let's just get it over with before I--
-(scoffs)

23:25.028 --> 23:28.532
Hey, I definitely didn't mean for that
to sound that way.

23:29.699 --> 23:32.536
You know, this is where I get insecure
and I wanna run back to New York.

23:32.619 --> 23:36.790
Hey, I want to marry you
more than anything,

23:36.873 --> 23:39.418
and I don't wanna delay it
a single second.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.671
In all of this madness...

23:44.339 --> 23:47.217
don't let my love for you get lost, okay?

23:48.093 --> 23:49.469
Okay.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.433
Judas Priest. Again with the kissing.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.852
-Is this for my benefit?
-No, Denny, it's for mine.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.937
-Do you need something?
-Do we have a ruling yet?

23:59.020 --> 24:00.897
No, not yet. We're still wa--

24:03.942 --> 24:06.611
(sighs) The judge ruled.

24:08.029 --> 24:11.074
Your injunction was denied.
The merger is valid.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.954
Look, Shirley none of us wanted this
to happen.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.166
But we have responsibilities to others.

24:19.916 --> 24:24.045
And like it or not,
this firm is bigger than all of us.

24:41.771 --> 24:42.814
Thank you for joining.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.612
Obviously, your remarks about China
are deeply disturbing.

24:49.404 --> 24:53.116
In a time when China is embracing
capitalism and American ideals,

24:53.408 --> 24:55.702
we expected to be welcomed
more graciously.

24:57.579 --> 25:01.333
Mr. Chang, uh,
the dirty little secret on China

25:02.667 --> 25:04.461
is the capitalism you so embrace

25:04.544 --> 25:08.006
consists primarily
of state-owned enterprises.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.384
Many of these companies,
including this one,

25:11.885 --> 25:13.553
are not really all that private.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.764
They are often tied to your government.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.434
There's nothing American about that ideal.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.269
(speaking in foreign language)

25:25.148 --> 25:27.943
Many of your banks today are owned
by your government.

25:29.736 --> 25:32.614
Our hope is that you would remain
with Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.659
We now have deep concerns

25:36.243 --> 25:38.537
over whether you will you serve
our interests with fidelity.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.122
If you feel you cannot,

25:41.665 --> 25:45.126
we would appreciate you acting with honor
and submitting your resignation.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.090
You'll have my resignation
by the end of business.

25:52.634 --> 25:56.513
Uh, since we're being honorable,
would you do me the courtesy

25:56.596 --> 26:00.016
of removing my good name
from these walls?

26:19.202 --> 26:22.163
(overlapping dialog)

26:23.957 --> 26:24.916
Bitch.

26:25.792 --> 26:28.587
-You quit?
-Carl, I just can't do this.

26:28.670 --> 26:29.963
No. Whoa, whoa.

26:30.046 --> 26:33.174
First of all, you never make this kind
of decision when you're emotional.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.176
And second, Shirley,
there are a lot of people around here

26:35.260 --> 26:37.637
who, now, more than ever,
are gonna be looking to you

26:37.721 --> 26:38.638
for reassurance.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.266
-This is not how a leader reacts.
-You can lead.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.727
No, I can't. I don't enjoy
the kind of loyalty you do here.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.020
We certainly don't want Denny in charge.

26:45.478 --> 26:49.608
Do not be submitting your resignation,
at least not yet.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.236
Oh, gee. It's Laurel and Hardy.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.865
Ms. Schmidt,
you have been very rude to us.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.034
We will not respond in kind.

27:00.076 --> 27:02.495
Mr. Sack, may we meet with you, please?

27:06.625 --> 27:11.004
I would submit there are four factors
the court must look at. First--

27:11.087 --> 27:14.424
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
You don't get to tell us what we must do.

27:14.507 --> 27:15.634
Sorry. Start again.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.053
Jerry, which justice are you playing?

27:18.470 --> 27:19.804
I was kind of a composite.

27:20.972 --> 27:25.977
Okay. I would like the Court
to consider four factors

27:26.061 --> 27:28.563
in determining
whether my client qualifies

27:28.647 --> 27:32.525
for the compassion exception
to the ban on experimental drugs--

27:32.609 --> 27:33.526
JERRY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:33.610 --> 27:36.696
You've come to the Supreme Court
looking for compassion?

27:36.780 --> 27:40.325
(laughs) Boy, did you walk
into the wrong room, I tell ya.

27:40.408 --> 27:41.785
Jerry, they won't do that.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.912
Can you lose the cigarette
and play it straight?

27:43.995 --> 27:45.163
This is kind of an important case.

27:47.874 --> 27:48.833
What's going on?

27:51.461 --> 27:52.754
Am I already dead?

27:55.131 --> 27:57.050
Effective as of January 1st,

27:57.133 --> 28:00.178
the litigation department
of Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt

28:00.261 --> 28:01.471
is being replaced.

28:01.846 --> 28:05.517
(laughs) What are you talking about?
We've all been fired?

28:05.600 --> 28:07.644
"Fired" is such an ugly word, Alan.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.646
An accurate one, but...

28:09.938 --> 28:13.191
I am sorry. This is no doubt
because I antagonized them.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.944
Fired? All of us?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.405
-Even me?
-Especially you.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.532
They fired you twice.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.119
(instrumental version
of "Joy to the World" playing)

28:24.202 --> 28:25.578
(indistinct chattering)

28:25.662 --> 28:26.955
We've been dead before,

28:27.038 --> 28:30.792
then suddenly,
like from the planet Mars, life.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.963
We could just start a new firm,

28:35.046 --> 28:38.717
but frankly, I don't think
I have the energy or the will.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.762
Never surrender, Shirley,
especially to a bunch of commies.

28:42.846 --> 28:45.140
SHIRLEY:
It's not about surrendering, Denny.

28:45.223 --> 28:49.352
It's just that it's time for me to marry
a man I love and start a real life.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.940
I... I mean him.

28:54.983 --> 28:59.863
Look, if you could permit an old lady
to peddle some advice,

28:59.946 --> 29:04.451
whatever you do next,
make sure it's something you love.

29:05.368 --> 29:08.329
A life, professional or personal,

29:08.705 --> 29:11.082
without passion, you're dead.

29:16.129 --> 29:20.008
Jerry, this can be the start
of a good thing.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.469
I just don't do well with goodbyes.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.764
Look, we are going to come through this,

29:26.055 --> 29:29.809
and we will do that by focusing
on what's immediately ahead of us.

29:29.893 --> 29:34.022
For me, that's my wedding,
which is Saturday at St. Christopher's.

29:34.105 --> 29:37.150
You are all, of course, invited.
We're keeping it fairly small.

29:37.233 --> 29:39.235
That's rushing it, isn't it?
You just got engaged.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.363
-I'm knocked up, Denny.
-(gasps)

29:42.864 --> 29:44.157
-(chuckles)
-Kidding. Kidding.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.867
As for the four of you,

29:45.950 --> 29:49.329
you must concentrate all your focus
and energy

29:49.412 --> 29:50.789
on the Supreme Court argument.

29:50.872 --> 29:51.748
How do you stand?

29:51.831 --> 29:54.042
I found a new case on point.
Katie helped.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.920
There is precedent for allowing
an experimental drug.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.465
Alan, you're very quiet.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.677
-I'll be ready by Friday.
-What are you thinking about?

30:08.848 --> 30:12.018
-I think we should fire them.
-Excuse me?

30:12.268 --> 30:13.895
ALAN: Our new bosses.
It's not right that they fired us.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.355
I think we should fire them.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.943
I know you're good,
but exactly how would that work?

30:20.026 --> 30:20.860
(scoffs)

30:23.404 --> 30:24.405
Get us a meeting.

30:45.844 --> 30:49.806
(exhales) Now, look, I know
there's a lot riding on this meeting,

30:49.889 --> 30:53.768
but I want everyone to just take
a deep breath and stay calm.

30:54.185 --> 30:57.397
Alan, can you handle it? Can't you, Alan?

30:58.565 --> 31:00.275
Larry Storch played Agarn, right?

31:00.942 --> 31:03.111
-On<i> F Troop, </i>yes.
-What's<i> F Troop?</i>

31:03.736 --> 31:05.738
I loved<i> F Troop.</i>

31:07.866 --> 31:08.700
Dear lord.

31:09.325 --> 31:10.577
(elevator bell dings)

31:19.586 --> 31:21.546
Greetings, our Chinese carpetbaggers.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.090
I'm told it's customary to bow.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.467
-That's the Japanese.
-Greetings. Good to see you.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.635
Yes, hello. Good to see you.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.304
Greetings. Yes.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.221
Oh, love the tie.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.931
Greetings. Yes. Hello.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.641
Good to see you. Greetings, yes.

31:33.725 --> 31:38.062
Okay, this concludes the bowing
and kowtowing portion of the presentation.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.857
I'm told we need an interpreter.
Who would that be?

31:40.940 --> 31:42.108
Actually, Mr. Shore,

31:42.191 --> 31:44.360
almost everybody here
can understand English.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.571
And since this is
a unilateral presentation,

31:46.654 --> 31:47.989
why don't you just talk?

31:48.072 --> 31:49.782
Excellent. We didn't allow time for you
to speak anyway.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.618
I'm having second thoughts
about that tie, though.

31:52.327 --> 31:55.163
Oh, good. He does understand.
So, where to begin?

31:55.997 --> 31:58.207
How about welcome
to Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt?

31:58.291 --> 31:59.626
I'm afraid you're all fired.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.836
Nothing personal. You seem like fine folk.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.838
Love the discipline, the 10,000 drummers,

32:04.172 --> 32:06.174
but it's not working out,
so, sorry, out you go.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.842
Single file, please.
Move along. Bye-bye.

32:07.926 --> 32:11.095
-(Alan claps)
-(men speaking in foreign language)

32:11.179 --> 32:13.681
Mr. Shore, we now own the firm.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.433
Well, that doesn't much matter, mister...

32:15.516 --> 32:16.559
-Lee.
-ALAN: Lee, yes.

32:16.643 --> 32:17.810
This is America, and in America,

32:17.894 --> 32:19.646
it all comes down
to who the jury likes better.

32:19.729 --> 32:22.565
And I don't think an American jury
will side with a Communist, do you?

32:22.982 --> 32:24.525
Juries typically frown on oppressors,

32:24.609 --> 32:26.736
even when they're capitalists,
so the idea of China--

32:26.819 --> 32:28.446
On what grounds
could you possibly prevail?

32:28.529 --> 32:30.531
(laughs) Grounds? Who cares about grounds?

32:30.615 --> 32:33.409
Cases always come down
to who the jury likes better.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.994
Did I not just say this? I think I did.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.371
So, anyway, meet the group.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.332
We're a fine, very likable group,
infectious smiles.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.416
Smile, group.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.211
And best of all, bad for you,
we're very good.

32:43.294 --> 32:46.297
Did you check out our win-loss record?
Good for us, bad for you.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.591
More importantly,
did you note the kinds of cases

32:48.675 --> 32:49.926
that we argue week to week?

32:50.009 --> 32:52.512
Typically preposterous,
mostly unwinnable on their face,

32:52.595 --> 32:54.222
and yet, we win them
whether we have grounds or not.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.890
Must be the smiles. Smile, group.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.559
And here, we actually do have grounds.

32:58.643 --> 33:02.021
For you to summarily<i> Schmidtcan</i>
an entire litigation department,

33:02.105 --> 33:04.273
a successful one no less, because, well...

33:04.357 --> 33:06.776
because I guess you don't like us,
it seems arbitrary,

33:06.859 --> 33:09.529
capricious, actionable,
winnable of all things.

33:09.612 --> 33:11.990
It doesn't really seem fair,
does it, for us to have

33:12.073 --> 33:13.908
both the merits and the smiles?

33:14.158 --> 33:15.576
Smile, group. But we do.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.245
A wrongful discharge

33:17.328 --> 33:19.622
subject to compensatory
and punitive damages

33:19.706 --> 33:21.249
could be lots and lots of money,

33:21.332 --> 33:23.209
not to mention,
think of the fallout here at the firm.

33:23.292 --> 33:25.753
You see, we're not just good litigators,
we're popular.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.380
Again, could be the smiles.

33:27.463 --> 33:30.466
And you firing us, well, that would be
a terrible, terrible way

33:30.550 --> 33:31.634
to introduce yourselves.

33:31.718 --> 33:34.429
I mean, uh, Denny Crane, Shirley Schmidt,
you must be joking.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.639
I... I know how the Chinese love to kid,

33:36.723 --> 33:39.267
like with the, uh,
the tanks in the square,

33:39.350 --> 33:41.602
the monks in Tibet, or... or daughters.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.981
Uh, but you could have
a mass exodus of lawyers

33:45.064 --> 33:46.983
long before we even get to trial,

33:47.066 --> 33:49.485
which we will, of course,
get to just the same,

33:49.569 --> 33:50.862
and when we do, take caution.

33:50.945 --> 33:54.574
Here's a little tip.
We, Americans, love to trade on fear.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.659
Ask W. Ask Dick. Ask Rummy.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.328
Fear sells. Fear works.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.497
The fear I'll be trading on is China,

34:01.581 --> 34:06.502
Communist China, taking our jobs,
first over there, then over here.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.589
Where you once were passive investors,
now you want active control.

34:09.672 --> 34:12.967
That scares Americans, active Communists,

34:13.051 --> 34:15.053
made in China, seeking control.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.721
Ooh, scary!

34:16.804 --> 34:19.766
One last thought,
we're giant slayers here.

34:19.849 --> 34:20.933
It's what we do.

34:21.017 --> 34:24.312
Be it the United States government,
Big Pharmaceutical,

34:24.395 --> 34:27.273
Big Tobacco, Big Oil, it never gets old.

34:27.356 --> 34:29.358
And just when it seemed
we were fresh out of bigs,

34:29.442 --> 34:32.445
along came you, China,
the poster child for big.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.864
Oh! To parade you
in front of an American jury...

34:34.947 --> 34:36.449
Well, here's your out.

34:36.532 --> 34:40.161
We'll agree not to fire you, not to sue,
on one condition.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.246
We stay, and we stay in charge.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.624
Do what you want with Corporate or Tax.

34:44.707 --> 34:46.334
But in Litigation, we run the show.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.795
Shirley Schmidt, Denny Crane,
Carl Sack, Jerry Espenson,

34:48.878 --> 34:50.338
Katie Lloyd, and me, it's our party.

34:50.421 --> 34:52.215
Stay out of our way,
we'll stay out of yours.

34:52.298 --> 34:54.050
<i>That </i>is the deal.

34:59.806 --> 35:02.975
(laughing, cheering)

35:03.059 --> 35:05.269
(speaking in foreign language)

35:08.481 --> 35:11.734
I'm not sure you got
the desired effect there, Al.

35:20.868 --> 35:23.871
My father used to say,
after watching the Bruins with Bobby Orr,

35:24.622 --> 35:26.833
it just wasn't the same after.

35:28.376 --> 35:32.004
I think I'll feel that way
about watching Alan Shore practice law.

35:34.048 --> 35:37.593
There will never be anyone,
ever, like him.

35:41.180 --> 35:44.350
-If we break up...
-Do I need to reach for the oil can?

35:44.767 --> 35:46.227
(chuckles) Oh.

35:48.020 --> 35:51.190
-We still on for dinner?
-Yes.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.486
This'll be, like, our third date, Jerry.

36:00.491 --> 36:01.909
Hello. Welcome. Hello.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.579
Relax. We don't need to kiss.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.459
(chuckles)

36:32.190 --> 36:33.441
(inhales sharply)

36:35.651 --> 36:37.987
They have decided to reinstate us.

36:38.863 --> 36:43.284
Evidently, they agree it would send
a bad message to summarily broom us.

36:43.367 --> 36:46.245
Which means they probably just plan
to do it more gradually.

36:46.329 --> 36:47.872
(chuckles) Perhaps.

36:48.331 --> 36:51.959
They are bringing in somebody new
to oversee the litigation department.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.544
-Who?
-SHIRLEY: I don't know.

36:54.462 --> 36:57.924
But for now, more life from Mars, I guess.

36:58.007 --> 37:01.177
Well, do we even want it, Shirley?

37:02.053 --> 37:03.846
We could now leave on our own terms.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.932
Well... (chuckles)

37:06.849 --> 37:10.394
right now, let's concentrate
on the Supreme Court...

37:10.478 --> 37:12.313
-Ah.
-And my wedding.

37:12.855 --> 37:14.106
And we'll take it from there.

37:16.150 --> 37:17.109
Thank you, Alan.

37:19.028 --> 37:19.862
You... (chuckles)

37:21.113 --> 37:22.698
You are really something.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.409
Usually, when women tell me that,
it's to get inside my--

37:25.493 --> 37:26.327
Alan.

37:29.997 --> 37:30.915
See you tomorrow.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.292
Feels good to say that.

37:55.356 --> 37:58.693
-ALAN: How are you doing?
-Better days.

37:59.318 --> 38:01.195
-Worse, too.
-Oh.

38:01.654 --> 38:03.114
So we live again.

38:03.948 --> 38:04.782
For now.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.538
Hell of a speech, Alan.
I even listened this time.

38:10.621 --> 38:11.956
(chuckles) To all of it?

38:12.039 --> 38:13.708
-Don't be ridiculous.
-(laughs)

38:15.459 --> 38:16.294
(sighs)

38:17.670 --> 38:19.755
Denny, I've been thinking
about what Shirley said.

38:20.089 --> 38:21.924
Loving life, loving your job.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.343
We've always done both.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.930
But will we under this new regime?

38:30.016 --> 38:35.438
If I could do anything, I think
it would be to open my own legal aid firm.

38:35.771 --> 38:36.814
What the hell is that?

38:37.148 --> 38:38.482
Well, basically, it's a firm

38:38.566 --> 38:41.652
where you give your services away
for free.

38:42.361 --> 38:43.321
What's the point?

38:43.404 --> 38:46.032
(chuckles) Denny, in this economy,

38:46.115 --> 38:49.327
those are gonna be the first services cut,
legal aid to the poor.

38:49.952 --> 38:50.786
Oh.

38:52.830 --> 38:57.001
Do you think
that I might like poor people?

38:58.377 --> 38:59.837
I've never taken the time to know one.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.214
Oh, they can be very nice
once you get to know them.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.469
The problem is funding it.

39:08.220 --> 39:13.142
Plus, I must admit, I enjoy having money
to travel and fish, eat well.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.436
You know where this discussion
is headed, don't you?

39:15.811 --> 39:16.645
Where?

39:18.022 --> 39:19.440
Straight to the altar.

39:19.523 --> 39:20.358
(scoffs)

39:21.108 --> 39:25.696
Alan, I have more money than God,
unless he timed the market.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.282
But I can't give it to you
'cause the government

39:28.366 --> 39:30.618
will take half with the gift tax,

39:30.910 --> 39:35.206
and I can't die and leave it to you
'cause of the estate tax.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.165
Don't get me started.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.125
If you were my spouse,

39:38.918 --> 39:41.962
I could give it, I could leave it to you.

39:42.713 --> 39:45.800
What's mine is yours.

39:46.425 --> 39:47.760
The government can't touch it.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.888
Oh, for that matter,
you could open a business

39:50.971 --> 39:53.182
or start a foundation--

39:53.265 --> 39:57.144
In which case, you can't use it
for incidentals like travel, fishing.

39:57.561 --> 40:01.690
And the way you go after the government,
they already audit you.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.359
They'll find a way to nail you

40:03.442 --> 40:06.237
for commingling, or malfeasance,
or whatever.

40:07.113 --> 40:10.991
The cleanest, simplest,
most efficient transfer of property

40:12.243 --> 40:13.244
is marriage.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.329
Plus, all those other reasons.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.666
Medical, spousal privilege,

40:20.000 --> 40:20.835
immunity.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.799
(laughing)
It's beyond ridiculous, even for us.

40:29.552 --> 40:32.012
I've always wanted to remarry
before I die.

40:33.013 --> 40:36.100
Really? Why?

40:39.770 --> 40:40.855
I just have.

40:41.397 --> 40:44.191
And like it or not,

40:47.153 --> 40:48.279
you're the man I love.

40:51.407 --> 40:52.491
Think of all the...

40:53.284 --> 40:55.327
-What do you call 'em, poor people?
-Yes.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.705
Think of all the poor people you can help,

40:57.788 --> 41:01.667
allocating my wealth to them,
not the Iraq War

41:01.750 --> 41:04.378
or the Wall Street bailout.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.465
Take my hand, Alan.

41:08.632 --> 41:09.508
Take my money.

41:13.095 --> 41:15.181
I always thought
if I were to get married again,

41:15.264 --> 41:19.435
it would be for love and romance.

41:21.270 --> 41:22.229
You love me.

41:23.105 --> 41:24.773
Romance never lasts.

41:24.857 --> 41:25.733
Money can.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.533
Okay, Denny. I will marry you.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.368
Really?

41:37.411 --> 41:38.245
Why not?

41:38.913 --> 41:41.207
(laughs)
I suppose it had to come to this.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.417

41:43.501 --> 41:44.543

41:48.255 --> 41:50.090
Oh.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.510
-Like jumping a shark.
-(laughs)

41:52.885 --> 41:55.095
Hey, how about we do it
on the dock of Nimmo Bay?

41:55.554 --> 41:56.639
Perfect.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.933
A salmon in one hand...

41:59.391 --> 42:00.392
Me in the other.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.811
Let no man tear asunder.

42:03.354 --> 42:04.355

42:04.980 --> 42:06.398
This could be a television series.

42:07.024 --> 42:09.401

-One that cares.

42:10.069 --> 42:13.030
