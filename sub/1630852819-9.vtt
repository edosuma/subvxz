-All: How did you do it?
-(samantha laughs)

00:22.857 --> 00:24.823

(chuckles)

00:26.527 --> 00:30.362
thank you for taking me
through, uh, most of the steps.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.865
I know that I'm one of your
more annoying sponsees,

00:32.983 --> 00:34.199
but you very rarely
let that show,

00:34.335 --> 00:36.485
and I really appreciate it.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.671
Mindy, thank you for being
the greatest boss I've ever had,

00:39.790 --> 00:42.174
and-and by that I mean
thank you for not firing me.

00:43.827 --> 00:47.212
Felicia, thank you
for not giving up on me,

00:47.331 --> 00:49.548

you definitely should have.

And, yeah, to the rest of my

01:06.400 --> 01:09.902
you guys are the best trudging
buddies a girl could ask for.

01:10.020 --> 01:13.122
And, um, I just wish
my dad could be here,

01:13.240 --> 01:16.125
'cause he-he never
got to see me sober, you know.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.459
I mean, he did when I was a kid.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.628
I-I wasn't drinking
when I was four.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.414
Even though I think I would
have been really good at it.

01:22.533 --> 01:25.050
Uh, yeah, I just wish
he could see this.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.421
Anyway, uh, yeah, that's it.

01:29.540 --> 01:30.589
I love you guys.

-You bought it?

02:59.597 --> 03:01.963
I bought it, yeah.
It was such a good deal.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.398
'cause I was
looking at houses online,

03:03.484 --> 03:05.017
but, you know-- expensive, so...

03:05.135 --> 03:07.019
Yeah, more expensive than
places without houses. Um...

03:07.154 --> 03:08.570
Yeah, but then I heard about
this lot

03:08.689 --> 03:11.473
and I remembered,
"um, oh, yeah, I build houses."

03:11.525 --> 03:13.192
so why not just build our house?

03:13.310 --> 03:17.246

-Like, we talked about it.
-Yeah.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.818

building a house,

03:23.871 --> 03:26.171
but it was just conversation.

03:26.257 --> 03:27.873
I mean, I w-I want kids, but...

03:27.991 --> 03:29.758
Years from now.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.093
Yeah, or we have them sooner.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.711
'cause what-what's stopping us--
no space, right?

03:32.829 --> 03:34.179
Well, that and the fact
that we don't know

03:34.265 --> 03:36.381
what our next five years
looks like. I mean, what if...

03:36.517 --> 03:38.833

03:38.886 --> 03:40.969

03:43.641 --> 03:45.274

03:46.644 --> 03:48.393
I applied
to a fellowship at ucla.

03:48.512 --> 03:50.279
And you didn't tell me?

03:50.397 --> 03:51.980
Well, I was gonna tell you

03:52.066 --> 03:55.234

that you bought empty land.

04:25.316 --> 04:26.982
No.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.886
What about my

-Nope. That didn't work.
-No.

of this stuff for ivf.

05:54.471 --> 05:56.405
Well, they should warn you
that earnestness

05:56.523 --> 05:58.657
-is a serious side effect.
-Yeah. They should.

05:58.776 --> 06:02.027
I would have loved to know that
before I cried on air today.

She's always saying it reminds
her of<i> wild wild country.</i>

06:47.991 --> 06:49.524
Maybe she doesn't understand it

06:49.576 --> 06:51.076
because you haven't
made her a part of it yet.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.912
Have you written
your amends to her?

06:54.030 --> 06:55.029

06:55.082 --> 06:56.415
It doesn't have to be perfect.

06:56.533 --> 06:58.467
Just list all of the ways
in which

06:58.585 --> 07:00.051
you've done her harm
and synthesize it

07:00.137 --> 07:01.753
into a nice, bite-sized piece
that she can swallow.

07:01.872 --> 07:04.589

-I'm in the grading zone, so

stare straight ahead, so...

08:00.080 --> 08:02.897

buzz the sides. And then,

know how to say this, but, um...

or any place, um...

Uh, thank you for remembering.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.465
You know, that's actually, um...

08:53.584 --> 08:55.667
That's actually why
I want the drugs. You know?

08:55.802 --> 08:57.452
I just... I read a million
studies about it,

08:57.504 --> 09:00.138
and-and it just...
It helps people get some...

09:00.257 --> 09:03.091
Clarity on some stuff.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.676
Well, not, like,
a million studies--

09:04.794 --> 09:05.977
it's not, like,
in the med books or anything,
