01:56.908 --> 02:03.192
<i>To overcome the last frontier,
a return to youth is at your reach,</i>

02:03.408 --> 02:08.295
<i>in a body of your choice,
beautiful and healthy...</i>

02:08.491 --> 02:13.241
- Can you turn it off, please.
<i>- ...with limitless possibilities...</i>

02:13.242 --> 02:14.907
<i>RPG...</i>

02:14.908 --> 02:16.657
Yes, Mr. Battier.

02:16.658 --> 02:19.592
<i>your dreams come true...</i>

02:44.242 --> 02:47.560
Welcome to RPG, Mr. Battier.

03:12.700 --> 03:18.574
Mr. Chan, this is Mr. Steve
Battier, our last player.

03:18.575 --> 03:21.349
How are you Mr. Battier?

03:22.617 --> 03:25.241
As good as it gets, Mr. Chan.

03:25.242 --> 03:28.181
Have a seat sir, please.

03:32.075 --> 03:36.199
As we both are busy people,
I'm not going to waste time.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.782
RPG is biotechnology's
neurocellular answer

03:39.783 --> 03:42.770
to men's oldest aspiration:

03:42.783 --> 03:45.059
Eternal youth.

03:46.117 --> 03:50.199
The brain is like a computer
with myriads of connections

03:50.200 --> 03:53.824
processing past and
present information.

03:53.825 --> 03:57.491
After decades of experiments,
my team here at RPG

03:57.492 --> 04:03.264
found a way to transfer this accumulated
information to a new brain...

04:03.575 --> 04:05.851
Why the secrecy?

04:06.200 --> 04:10.941
Unfortunately, life and death
are not on the market...

04:10.992 --> 04:12.407
yet.

04:12.408 --> 04:16.308
We have a problem:
The young brain dies.

04:16.825 --> 04:21.642
If you want to experience what
it is like to be young again,

04:21.825 --> 04:24.183
someone has to die.

04:24.242 --> 04:28.058
An old brain in a new body...

04:28.950 --> 04:32.897
it sounds heavenly.

04:33.408 --> 04:37.866
In order to access the information
from the old brain in the new body,

04:37.867 --> 04:43.532
it's necessary that old body stay in
absolute rest during the connection.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.241
That's why we keep them in there...

04:46.242 --> 04:49.513
in a controlled environment...

04:51.117 --> 04:56.699
Since the timeframe in which we can run the
new bodies with the old brains is short,

04:56.700 --> 05:01.241
we decided to offer our clients
a radical experience...

05:01.242 --> 05:03.324
you will play a game:

05:03.325 --> 05:06.016
A Real Playing Game.

05:07.283 --> 05:11.491
This experience will stay
forever in your memory.

05:11.492 --> 05:14.449
What kind of game are
you thinking of?

05:14.450 --> 05:20.731
You and nine others participants,
in your young and beautiful bodies,

05:20.825 --> 05:26.449
will spend the next hours in a location
from where only one will come out alive.

05:26.450 --> 05:29.949
I prefer chess.
I'm not a violent man.

05:29.950 --> 05:34.558
If you are not sure of what
you want, you can still quit.

05:34.742 --> 05:41.074
If you want to experience youth again
you must complete the payment now.

05:41.075 --> 05:46.267
The other players have already
paid and are waiting for you.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.324
You will not regret this.

06:09.325 --> 06:12.809
It will be an
experience to remember!

06:14.867 --> 06:21.930
I can tell you something you don't
know yet, I don't have much time...

06:22.575 --> 06:28.146
it will be so nice to just
walk or move without pain

06:28.783 --> 06:32.268
and feel something like pleasure...

06:32.867 --> 06:37.062
and I don't mind
being young forever.

06:37.742 --> 06:40.598
Can you do that Mr. Chan?

06:41.283 --> 06:46.724
Unfortunately at this
time it seems impossible.

06:47.117 --> 06:50.032
We're still developing
our technology...

06:50.033 --> 06:56.268
I thought impossible was not
part of your vocabulary.

06:56.867 --> 07:01.684
There's no time for semantics
now, we'll talk after the game.

07:02.242 --> 07:08.523
Time to choose your new body...
they are beautiful, you'll see.

07:12.117 --> 07:14.407
What the fuck is this?

07:14.408 --> 07:16.671
Don't touch me.

07:17.033 --> 07:21.679
Sorry, wrong door.
Follow me, please.

07:25.825 --> 07:28.148
No, not this one.

07:32.825 --> 07:35.646
Portugal in ruins?

07:38.117 --> 07:41.140
That seems just about right.

08:23.867 --> 08:26.129
Number 7.

08:26.700 --> 08:29.023
We can start now.

09:04.450 --> 09:06.713
Let's test this.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.963
This way...

10:12.283 --> 10:19.265
Ladies and Gentlemen, for the next
10 hours, you'll be young again.

10:21.033 --> 10:26.971
Let's choose a location where you
want to live this extreme experience.

10:27.742 --> 10:30.148
You can choose now.

10:35.492 --> 10:37.754
Let's play!

10:37.950 --> 10:40.226
Let's play...

12:09.367 --> 12:11.629
Anybody there?

12:13.033 --> 12:15.937
Is there anybody out there?

12:30.992 --> 12:33.268
<i>Anybody there?</i>

12:47.658 --> 12:49.921
Who are you?

12:55.783 --> 12:58.046
What is this place?

12:59.658 --> 13:01.921
No idea.

13:06.908 --> 13:10.449
Do you know who you are
or what this place is?

13:10.450 --> 13:12.965
I know very well you I am.

13:14.450 --> 13:16.713
And you?

13:17.158 --> 13:19.491
What are you doing here?

13:19.492 --> 13:22.425
Still trying to figure that out.

13:22.617 --> 13:24.407
What about you?

13:24.408 --> 13:26.671
I don't know.

13:28.450 --> 13:30.532
Someone must have drugged me...

13:30.533 --> 13:33.606
I just woke up here, I don't know.

13:34.242 --> 13:36.683
That makes two of us.

13:39.617 --> 13:42.899
Do you remember where
you were before?

13:44.700 --> 13:46.963
No.

13:47.742 --> 13:50.004
Amnesia?

13:50.367 --> 13:52.629
Just a little.

13:53.575 --> 13:55.838
Same here.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.505
Let's get out of here...

14:05.242 --> 14:07.979
Maybe we can find a way out.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.379
Yeah...

14:18.950 --> 14:20.866
Don't come any closer!

14:20.867 --> 14:24.741
I'm telling you... I've
nothing to do with this.

14:24.742 --> 14:29.407
Come on, do you think I'd bring
a woman to this... this dump?

14:29.408 --> 14:32.064
Nobody touches me!

14:32.242 --> 14:35.063
I'm as lost as you are...

14:35.783 --> 14:37.324
I'm not going to harm you...

14:37.325 --> 14:39.588
Are they with you?

14:41.283 --> 14:43.938
I never saw them in my life!

14:44.075 --> 14:45.866
Who are you?

14:45.867 --> 14:48.439
Do you know where we are?

14:48.492 --> 14:50.754
No idea.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.940
What's going on here?

14:54.950 --> 14:58.157
This crazy woman thinks I'm going
to attack her or something...

14:58.158 --> 15:01.477
Listen, it seems we're lost.

15:02.033 --> 15:04.296
Don't be afraid.

15:04.367 --> 15:07.555
Hey, down there, I heard you.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.907
I woke up in here, too.

15:11.908 --> 15:14.171
Come down...

15:14.533 --> 15:18.516
maybe we can talk some
sense into this woman.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.921
It's ok...

15:32.242 --> 15:37.813
I've had women ran away from
me before but never that fast!

15:38.408 --> 15:41.574
She'd be better off
staying with us.

15:41.575 --> 15:45.356
We have no idea what's
beyond these ruins.

15:45.950 --> 15:47.449
Where's the girl with the stick?

15:47.450 --> 15:49.491
Ran away.

15:49.492 --> 15:51.574
She wasn't with you?

15:51.575 --> 15:53.838
What do you think?

15:54.450 --> 15:58.081
It looks like we just
broke up, is that it?

15:58.283 --> 16:00.157
What about you?

16:00.158 --> 16:02.932
No, we came on our own, too.

16:03.867 --> 16:05.741
So, nobody knows anybody?

16:05.742 --> 16:08.004
Ah!

16:09.325 --> 16:11.588
What?

16:15.700 --> 16:19.979
Don't be scared, we're
not going to hurt you.

16:20.992 --> 16:23.241
What happened to you?

16:23.242 --> 16:26.157
Some woman hit me in the head.

16:26.158 --> 16:30.769
That crazy bitch, huh?!
We need to teach her a lesson.

16:30.950 --> 16:37.024
It's just wrong to hit people in the head
before even having a reason to do it.

16:39.658 --> 16:43.657
Do you think there could be
more people like us... around here?

16:43.658 --> 16:45.949
We could take a look at
the other buildings...

16:45.950 --> 16:50.032
maybe we find something there
that tells us where we are...

16:50.033 --> 16:53.139
I don't think there's much to find.

17:57.992 --> 18:00.855
Hey... There is somebody there.

18:04.408 --> 18:07.478
Hey, you down there!

18:09.408 --> 18:11.616
Don't be afraid.

18:11.617 --> 18:14.157
We're coming down to talk to you.

18:14.158 --> 18:16.421
We're all lost.

18:17.492 --> 18:21.308
We are not lost. We're stuck here.

18:28.825 --> 18:32.116
You said stuck? What
did you mean by that?

18:32.117 --> 18:34.379
You'll see.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.088
Hey!

18:40.367 --> 18:44.847
Guys... We've company.

18:47.158 --> 18:52.741
Let me guess, you woke up here and
you don't remember where you were

18:52.742 --> 18:54.324
and you don't know where you are?

18:54.325 --> 18:56.588
Exactly.

18:56.825 --> 18:59.270
Do you know where we are?

18:59.408 --> 19:04.565
No, I only saw an old big
building over there.

19:05.450 --> 19:08.306
Ok... Let's go and have a look.

20:17.033 --> 20:19.296
Nothing.

20:20.950 --> 20:23.532
I think it's better if we
find a way out of this place.

20:23.533 --> 20:24.907
Yeah...

20:24.908 --> 20:27.646
You can not leave this place.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.963
There is no way out.

20:30.992 --> 20:32.657
Who are you?

20:32.658 --> 20:37.741
I'm the gamekeeper and
you are the players.

20:37.742 --> 20:38.866
Players?

20:38.867 --> 20:39.991
Yes.

20:39.992 --> 20:44.741
This is a game and my job is to
give you the rules of the game.

20:44.742 --> 20:46.866
What kind of a sick joke is this?

20:46.867 --> 20:51.532
I know you're a little confused
but this is not a joke.

20:51.533 --> 20:55.433
Your real bodies are
in our Game Center.

20:56.450 --> 21:00.598
You are not young but old and sick.

21:01.992 --> 21:05.032
You don't remember because
your memories were adapted

21:05.033 --> 21:09.430
to the age of your new
bodies. These bodies.

21:10.867 --> 21:14.199
Are you telling us that we are
old geezers inside young bodies?

21:14.200 --> 21:17.157
You're not just old geezers...

21:17.158 --> 21:23.606
Believe it or not you are wealthy,
powerful and famous people.

21:25.075 --> 21:32.139
And you can be Boris Znovarev,
a Russian tycoon or...

21:33.825 --> 21:36.231
Kate Barrington,

21:36.575 --> 21:39.431
a famous Hollywood star!

21:40.408 --> 21:45.600
Yes, the choice was free, and
you chose the body you liked.

21:46.033 --> 21:50.157
But you can't waste any more time,
let see who you really are:

21:50.158 --> 21:54.934
Li Meng, Carlos Santiago,

21:56.492 --> 21:58.981
Yasmin Nova,

21:59.867 --> 22:02.991
Alice Fjallbacka,

22:02.992 --> 22:05.766
Steve Battier,

22:07.033 --> 22:14.264
Maria Moulineaux, Jorge
Valdez, Okot Ba.

22:15.658 --> 22:19.157
Now... let me get
back to the rules.

22:19.158 --> 22:24.848
Rule number one: Only one will
be alive at the end of the game.

22:25.117 --> 22:26.866
Rule number two:

22:26.867 --> 22:33.532
One of you must die each hour or the
game randomly takes care of that.

22:33.533 --> 22:36.157
You better stop with these rules?

22:36.158 --> 22:39.199
What the hell is all this?
Who's behind this?

22:39.200 --> 22:45.907
If I were you, I'd be careful about
what you reveal... it's dangerous...

22:45.908 --> 22:47.491
Why?

22:47.492 --> 22:50.991
Because you can only kill someone

22:50.992 --> 22:55.851
when you know who the real
person behind the body is.

22:56.158 --> 23:00.324
And don't make assumptions
on gender as well.

23:00.325 --> 23:05.268
You had the chance of choosing
a female or a male body.

23:05.533 --> 23:11.074
As you can see here you
are 5 women and 5 men,

23:11.075 --> 23:16.977
but in reality there
are 4 women and 6 men.

23:17.325 --> 23:22.449
The bios on the holograms refer
to who you are in the future,

23:22.450 --> 23:27.824
so some of you may be
surprised at who you become.

23:27.825 --> 23:30.074
What if we kill someone
we don't know?

23:30.075 --> 23:33.116
That will be a fatal mistake:

23:33.117 --> 23:37.782
You die if you come back here and
wrongfully identify the hologram

23:37.783 --> 23:40.116
of the person you killed.

23:40.117 --> 23:43.699
If what you're saying is
true, then in the future...

23:43.700 --> 23:45.449
In the present.

23:45.450 --> 23:48.840
Okay... in the present,

23:48.842 --> 23:53.699
we paid you to transfer our
brains into these bodies.

23:55.158 --> 23:58.161
So why should we kill each other?

23:58.617 --> 24:04.436
Because it's a game...
and you decided to play it.

24:05.367 --> 24:08.532
And how are we supposed
to kill each other?

24:08.533 --> 24:12.267
Slapping ourselves
to death... that's it?

24:13.075 --> 24:15.813
That's your call.

24:16.158 --> 24:17.741
This is ridiculous.

24:17.742 --> 24:19.907
I understand you may
think that now,

24:19.908 --> 24:26.032
but I can assure you when you signed the
contract you agreed to all these rules

24:26.033 --> 24:28.641
very enthusiastically.

24:30.033 --> 24:32.282
The clock is ticking.

24:32.283 --> 24:35.949
You have less than an
hour until the first death.

24:35.950 --> 24:40.407
After you make the kill you have ten
minutes to come back to this room

24:40.408 --> 24:45.600
and touch the hologram of the
person you believe you have killed.

24:47.283 --> 24:48.907
Enjoy the game!

24:48.908 --> 24:50.824
Wait!

24:50.825 --> 24:53.101
This can't be true.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.574
We have to stick together;

24:55.575 --> 24:57.491
this guy tries to turn
us against each other.

24:57.492 --> 24:59.324
This can be some
kind of a sick game

24:59.325 --> 25:01.824
where rich old people get off on
watching us killing each other.

25:01.825 --> 25:04.088
Get off?

25:08.158 --> 25:11.311
Did anyone see their name already?

25:11.325 --> 25:12.616
I didn't...

25:12.617 --> 25:14.879
Me neither.

25:16.075 --> 25:18.351
I don't think so...

25:18.367 --> 25:20.629
I hope not...

25:28.617 --> 25:33.225
Hey, you're reading that bio
very carefully, is that you?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.784
I'm going to read them all.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.588
Hey, China man...

25:49.117 --> 25:51.523
are you really Chinese?

25:53.242 --> 25:55.199
Supposedly, some of these
people are famous.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.366
Does anyone know who they are?

25:57.367 --> 26:00.824
They're from the future,
we don't know them yet.

26:00.825 --> 26:05.116
They're not from the future,
they are from the present.

26:05.117 --> 26:07.379
Good thinking.

26:08.325 --> 26:11.532
Maybe you are the
computer geek over there.

26:11.533 --> 26:14.746
Maybe you created
the game yourself.

26:14.908 --> 26:18.949
Oh, if you're so sure, why don't you
kill me right now and get the game on?

26:18.950 --> 26:22.616
Wait a second, if all these characters
are different nationalities,

26:22.617 --> 26:24.574
how come we're all
speaking English?

26:24.575 --> 26:26.532
I got a theory about that,

26:26.533 --> 26:29.449
but if I tell it to you I may
run the risk of being killed

26:29.450 --> 26:32.532
by my friend over there on the
count of being a computer geek.

26:32.533 --> 26:34.949
Oh, pray, tell us anyway.

26:34.950 --> 26:37.741
I don't believe any
of this bullshit.

26:37.742 --> 26:42.116
Maybe you are an agent from the
people who made this game,

26:42.117 --> 26:44.991
sent here to convince
us of its rules.

26:44.992 --> 26:48.741
Maybe if we just find a way out
of here they can't control us.

26:48.742 --> 26:51.004
I agree.

26:51.242 --> 26:54.228
Okay, let's go.

27:15.783 --> 27:18.046
Hey...

27:20.950 --> 27:23.116
I think that one is the playboy.

27:23.117 --> 27:24.199
Why?

27:24.200 --> 27:28.017
Did you notice how he
looks at us women?

27:28.617 --> 27:31.199
He can be the lesbian
in a man's body.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.616
You're right. That makes sense.

27:33.617 --> 27:36.574
Given the opportunity
what did a lesbian do?

27:36.575 --> 27:39.645
She'd incarnate in a man's body.

27:41.575 --> 27:43.838
Shit...

27:48.575 --> 27:50.838
Oh...

27:52.283 --> 27:54.546
What's this?!

28:09.492 --> 28:12.431
I never saw a fence like this...

28:12.908 --> 28:15.848
Beware, looks dangerous...

28:17.617 --> 28:21.066
Dangerous? I don't think so...

28:21.783 --> 28:24.889
Ok, let's see how dangerous it is.

28:30.242 --> 28:33.644
I told you we are prisoners here.

28:36.158 --> 28:38.241
Do you think it goes
all the way around?

28:38.242 --> 28:42.722
Obviously. They want to keep
the players on the field.

28:43.450 --> 28:48.128
We have 40 minutes to find
out if this is for real or not.

28:49.617 --> 28:52.058
You speak, after all.

28:53.908 --> 28:56.074
What about food?

28:56.075 --> 29:00.683
Do you think they thought of
feeding us while we're here?

29:09.908 --> 29:12.657
Who really believes what
the hologram said is true?

29:12.658 --> 29:15.314
What?! Nobody?

29:16.200 --> 29:20.764
Your mind is everything.
What you think you become.

29:21.533 --> 29:24.520
What's your most recent memory?

29:25.075 --> 29:26.532
See?

29:26.533 --> 29:29.032
You claim you don't believe
it, but, just in case,

29:29.033 --> 29:33.083
you're not going to say
something about yourself.

29:34.908 --> 29:38.282
Seems we all believe
in this, after all.

29:38.283 --> 29:40.546
I don't.

29:40.825 --> 29:44.642
Good. Tell us something
about you then.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.574
No problem.

29:46.575 --> 29:50.532
I like sports, to go out
at night and movies.

29:50.533 --> 29:52.796
Everyone likes that.

29:54.242 --> 29:56.686
Are you a man or a woman?

29:56.908 --> 29:59.366
A woman, of course...

29:59.367 --> 30:02.657
but I think I might be gay...

30:02.658 --> 30:03.949
Why?

30:03.950 --> 30:07.366
Since I have some women
in my memories...

30:07.367 --> 30:08.866
Wait.

30:08.867 --> 30:13.199
You're saying that you're that
gay activist from the holograms?

30:13.200 --> 30:17.741
Maybe, but I'm not sure, really.

30:17.742 --> 30:22.074
If you really don't believe in the
game why you just tell us who you are

30:22.075 --> 30:24.741
instead of evading the question?

30:24.742 --> 30:26.782
Because I don't know.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.782
- Bullshit.
- I'm serious.

30:28.783 --> 30:31.782
I looked at the bios and I could
only think that I would love to be

30:31.783 --> 30:33.491
2 or 3 of those people.

30:33.492 --> 30:36.763
Hum... but I'm not sure who I am.

30:38.367 --> 30:42.616
You think... Hitler knew he was
to be Hitler when he was 20?

30:42.617 --> 30:44.074
Who's Hitler?

30:44.075 --> 30:50.358
Hitler may not have known that he'd get
that far but at 20 he was already a Nazi.

30:50.742 --> 30:53.782
There was no Hitler in those bios.

30:53.783 --> 30:56.949
There is a dictator
and some autocrats...

30:56.950 --> 30:59.241
One of them is Chinese.

30:59.242 --> 31:01.504
Or Korean.

31:06.325 --> 31:10.438
Well... the real Chinese
knows who he is, right?

31:11.158 --> 31:15.836
The real Chinese would do
anything to pass as a westerner.

31:17.242 --> 31:19.116
This is good for the star.

31:19.117 --> 31:20.199
Who?

31:20.200 --> 31:21.991
The movie star.

31:21.992 --> 31:26.555
She's an actress, she can
be whoever she likes.

31:31.742 --> 31:33.407
We're playing their game.

31:33.408 --> 31:36.760
We shouldn't even be
considering this.

31:37.950 --> 31:41.449
Does anybody actually have the
courage to kill someone else?

31:41.450 --> 31:44.769
Were there any killers in the bios?

31:44.908 --> 31:50.843
Apart from the dictators, but they don't
normally kill with their own hands.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.907
Let's just go to the hologram room?

32:00.908 --> 32:03.184
It's almost time.

32:04.117 --> 32:07.305
What? You're not coming?

32:09.242 --> 32:11.600
Just in case,

32:12.825 --> 32:15.532
we should wait out
the hour in our own.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.116
So you believe it?

32:17.117 --> 32:20.407
People under stress can do the
most unpredictable things.

32:20.408 --> 32:24.532
But if you believe the rules, even
if you're not close to any of us,

32:24.533 --> 32:26.407
you can die by the game.

32:26.408 --> 32:29.574
I still think it's
better if we split up.

32:29.575 --> 32:32.230
Hell is other people.

32:33.992 --> 32:36.241
It's just like real life, isn't it?

32:36.242 --> 32:39.324
You never know what is going
to happen after you die,

32:39.325 --> 32:43.116
if there's hell or heaven,
if there's an afterlife,

32:43.117 --> 32:45.949
or if there's nothing at all...

32:45.950 --> 32:50.838
With that kind of thinking you
could be the new age singer...

32:52.283 --> 32:54.546
20 minutes...

33:37.158 --> 33:39.481
What's your plan?

33:41.075 --> 33:43.517
Let's follow the wall.

33:44.950 --> 33:47.605
Maybe there is a way out.

33:48.908 --> 33:53.991
Oh, but, when the hour is over,
how are we going to know

33:53.992 --> 33:58.460
if someone killed anybody,
or if there's a random death?

34:00.117 --> 34:02.379
We may not know.

34:02.575 --> 34:05.313
Unless we kill each other.

34:10.242 --> 34:12.504
Yah.

34:15.867 --> 34:18.129
I can't kill.

34:22.283 --> 34:24.545
Me neither.

34:25.117 --> 34:28.387
But there'll be only
one survivor...

34:28.658 --> 34:31.116
I thought about that and
I know what I prefer.

34:31.117 --> 34:33.379
What is it?

34:34.908 --> 34:40.147
I would rather die randomly by the
game than to kill someone else.

34:43.617 --> 34:46.770
I'm so glad I ran into you...

34:55.949 --> 34:59.302
We don't even know
each other names...

34:59.533 --> 35:01.574
Yah...

35:01.575 --> 35:02.782
But...

35:02.783 --> 35:07.616
if... if we're going to stick together
we have to trust each other, right?

35:07.617 --> 35:10.616
Well, let's make this easier on us:

35:10.617 --> 35:13.741
The less we know about
each other the better.

35:13.742 --> 35:16.824
Yah... Yah, you're right.

35:16.825 --> 35:20.782
We can still stick together,
take care of each other,

35:20.783 --> 35:24.683
but without talking about us.

35:25.158 --> 35:29.982
Yah... It is an original date.

35:30.325 --> 35:32.199
You know...

35:32.200 --> 35:34.866
We don't have to talk about
the same old things:

35:34.867 --> 35:40.390
Ex-lovers, family,
our aspirations and fears...

35:40.950 --> 35:41.991
I like it.

35:41.992 --> 35:44.254
Yah!

35:47.408 --> 35:49.767
But if...

35:51.450 --> 35:56.393
if the idea of this game is
to enjoy our young bodies...

35:59.325 --> 36:01.588
Yah!?

36:02.867 --> 36:06.138
We could really enjoy ourselves...

39:37.492 --> 39:41.199
I was fourteen and he was
seventeen and hot...

39:41.200 --> 39:45.266
but when he kissed me
I felt nothing... Zero.

39:45.283 --> 39:47.699
Since then I never
kissed anybody else.

39:47.700 --> 39:48.449
Really?

39:48.450 --> 39:49.241
Yeah.

39:49.242 --> 39:50.657
Why?

39:50.658 --> 39:53.532
I don't want to be disappointed.

39:53.533 --> 39:56.639
And you never kissed a woman?

39:57.825 --> 39:59.074
Never.

39:59.075 --> 40:01.338
Why not?

40:02.075 --> 40:04.338
I can try...

40:14.408 --> 40:17.032
Why did you kiss me?
You're not a lesbian.

40:17.033 --> 40:18.116
Why do you say that?

40:18.117 --> 40:20.657
Because you're not even a woman.

40:20.658 --> 40:22.824
I'm not a woman?

40:22.825 --> 40:24.282
Are you sure?

40:24.283 --> 40:28.032
Yes. And I don't have
time for this shit.

40:28.033 --> 40:30.356
How much time's left?

40:31.283 --> 40:33.546
Very little.

40:34.033 --> 40:36.032
What's a colposcopy?

40:36.033 --> 40:37.616
What?

40:37.617 --> 40:41.199
And a speculum, do
you know what it is?

40:41.200 --> 40:43.491
I don't know what you
are talking about?

40:43.492 --> 40:46.858
And a hysteroscopy?
Have you had one?

40:47.117 --> 40:49.116
I had an arthroscopy once...

40:49.117 --> 40:51.854
Oh... That's interesting.

40:54.367 --> 40:58.347
I don't understand where
you're going with this.

40:58.575 --> 41:01.846
Are you a professional athlete?

41:02.492 --> 41:06.972
I told you I don't know who I am.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.129
I think you do.

41:14.950 --> 41:17.213
What happened?

41:17.450 --> 41:19.808
You better not look.

41:20.075 --> 41:23.394
Oh my god! Help! Help!

41:25.992 --> 41:29.358
Help! Oh my god! Help!

41:57.783 --> 42:00.046
Oh, my...

42:00.492 --> 42:04.053
Don't look... Don't
look... Don't look...

42:11.742 --> 42:13.032
Why are you running?

42:13.033 --> 42:15.897
At the fence... It's horrible...

44:08.242 --> 44:10.949
Did you kill the sports superstar?

44:10.950 --> 44:14.782
Nope. But somebody did.

44:14.783 --> 44:17.116
We heard screams,
did you hear them?

44:17.117 --> 44:20.021
Yeah, far away, some woman.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.349
Let's see if we can find her?

44:23.367 --> 44:25.574
Hey... hey, show up.

44:25.575 --> 44:28.017
I know you are there...

44:32.033 --> 44:34.296
We're nine, now.

44:37.700 --> 44:40.521
Did you see somebody in here?

44:41.492 --> 44:42.907
What happened?

44:42.908 --> 44:47.032
It's that woman... the one who was
talking about not knowing who she was...

44:47.033 --> 44:48.074
I found her.

44:48.075 --> 44:49.616
Where?

44:49.617 --> 44:52.354
She was dead by the fence.

44:52.367 --> 44:57.254
I heard a scream and when I
reached the fence she was dead...

44:57.283 --> 44:58.657
it's horrible...

44:58.658 --> 45:01.065
She wasn't a woman.

45:01.075 --> 45:03.338
What do you mean?

45:03.742 --> 45:07.303
The hologram that's
missing was from a man.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.463
The football star.

45:11.700 --> 45:13.616
A man?

45:13.617 --> 45:15.879
If this is right.

45:16.408 --> 45:19.900
Are you sure it was
an accidental death?

45:22.033 --> 45:23.532
What do you mean?

45:23.533 --> 45:28.616
Just checking it wasn't someone working
for the game that killed her... or him...

45:28.617 --> 45:32.350
I found him dead... I can't tell...

45:33.033 --> 45:35.440
We saw the body.

45:35.450 --> 45:38.022
Can you take us to her?

45:39.200 --> 45:41.032
I wouldn't recommend it.

45:41.033 --> 45:47.848
The question is, did somebody make
the first kill, or was it the game?

46:57.825 --> 47:01.735
Do you really think nobody
would find you here?

47:02.408 --> 47:04.671
I'd be ready.

47:05.325 --> 47:08.099
What if we joined forces?

47:09.033 --> 47:12.407
This game doesn't
include any allies.

47:12.408 --> 47:18.482
If nobody kills anybody this hour you can
die by the game like the sports guy!

47:18.492 --> 47:19.991
How do you know?

47:19.992 --> 47:22.729
I saw him die at the fence.

47:23.825 --> 47:27.247
You know he was hidden
in a woman's body?

47:28.908 --> 47:32.449
Get out of there, it's weird
to be talking to a bush.

47:32.450 --> 47:36.065
I'm not Moses and you're not God.

47:45.075 --> 47:46.907
You know the bible well.

47:46.908 --> 47:48.116
So do you.

47:48.117 --> 47:50.824
I hope I never get so
old I get religious.

47:50.825 --> 47:57.032
Why do you care if I know the bible well?
You're trying to find out who I am?

47:57.033 --> 47:58.282
Aren't we all?

47:58.283 --> 48:00.824
Who do you think I am?

48:00.825 --> 48:04.741
There is that African president
who's a fervent Catholic.

48:04.742 --> 48:07.183
You think I'm a man?

48:30.033 --> 48:33.874
Don't you think she's
hiding something from us?

48:35.533 --> 48:37.809
Who, she?

48:38.617 --> 48:42.241
No, the one that found the
other dead at the fence.

48:42.242 --> 48:44.504
Why do you say that?

48:45.825 --> 48:50.898
I don't know but her story
seemed a little bit off.

48:50.950 --> 48:53.116
Maybe she killed her.

48:53.117 --> 48:56.815
Maybe the game can
not kill at all...

48:58.200 --> 49:01.901
In fifteen minutes we
will have that answer.

49:04.408 --> 49:09.407
Quiet! Quiet, don't
move or I kill her!

49:09.408 --> 49:11.157
Do you know who she is?

49:11.158 --> 49:12.282
Who is she?

49:12.283 --> 49:15.157
Maybe you will find out...
but it will not be that easy.

49:15.158 --> 49:19.949
Maybe she decides to tell me who
she is and die quickly or find out

49:19.950 --> 49:22.574
that there are worst
things than dying!

49:22.575 --> 49:26.241
With that kind of attitude
it's easy to know who you are.

49:26.242 --> 49:29.691
Oh yeah? And who am I?

49:30.533 --> 49:33.224
The Russian secret agent.

49:35.200 --> 49:37.949
Don't you think that
is a bit obvious?

49:37.950 --> 49:40.907
Don't you believe in the
capacity for people to change

49:40.908 --> 49:42.907
when their life is at stake?

49:42.908 --> 49:48.032
I believe a lot of things and right now I
believe that you're not going to do that.

49:48.033 --> 49:50.558
You want to try me?

49:50.992 --> 49:54.690
No, I'm only saying what I believe.

49:59.283 --> 50:04.024
Tell me who he is
and I let you live.

50:05.408 --> 50:11.145
I know you've been together;
maybe you talked a little after sex...

50:12.075 --> 50:14.338
You fucked her?

50:15.783 --> 50:18.491
He never said anything.

50:18.492 --> 50:24.892
You didn't get anything, if he's into
politics... computers... movies?

50:25.992 --> 50:28.254
Keep away!

50:28.742 --> 50:31.907
You and me are going
to have a little talk.

50:31.908 --> 50:34.171
Wait!

50:37.908 --> 50:40.353
What are you going to do?

50:41.575 --> 50:44.159
We're getting some weapons.

50:51.825 --> 50:54.032
What do you say? Is this you?

50:54.033 --> 50:56.699
The rebel princess from
a Nordic royal family?

50:56.700 --> 50:57.824
Huh?

50:57.825 --> 51:02.074
No, I don't think you'd go to a
man for protection, come on.

51:02.075 --> 51:05.574
And this lesbian?
Huh? Is it you? Huh?

51:05.575 --> 51:09.555
I don't think you would
use a man as a disguise?

51:11.658 --> 51:13.657
What about the artist?

51:13.658 --> 51:17.324
Lonely and recluse at her
multimillion dollar estate?

51:17.325 --> 51:22.241
Is what makes sense for you to side
with a man... you're helpless...

51:22.242 --> 51:25.016
you don't like violence...

51:25.533 --> 51:27.940
I could be a guy.

51:27.950 --> 51:30.449
It doesn't say here that
any of these guys are gay.

51:30.450 --> 51:31.574
Why would I have to be gay?

51:31.575 --> 51:33.074
To enjoy fucking the other guy!?

51:33.075 --> 51:35.600
I could be faking it!

51:36.867 --> 51:39.604
Maybe you did. Come on...

51:40.367 --> 51:43.390
Movie star? Huh? Huh?

51:49.575 --> 51:52.949
Now let's find out if
you're the artist...

51:52.950 --> 51:57.857
Without any fingers, how are
you going to play the guitar?

51:58.700 --> 52:02.184
Aah!

52:05.867 --> 52:08.522
Or is it the piano?

52:09.867 --> 52:12.225
Aah...

52:21.283 --> 52:27.269
Wasn't it the Indians who scalped
the cowboys with stone axes?

52:28.825 --> 52:31.574
Just tell me who you are.

52:31.575 --> 52:33.616
I don't know who I am...

52:33.617 --> 52:35.724
Try another one...

52:38.825 --> 52:41.532
you don't know who you are?

52:41.533 --> 52:44.982
And you, do you know who you are?

52:45.783 --> 52:46.949
You want to bet?

52:46.950 --> 52:49.213
Make your move.

52:50.783 --> 52:54.491
You're pretty confident that you
can beat me with that rock.

52:54.492 --> 52:56.532
Leave her alone.

52:56.533 --> 52:59.074
Oh! Someone who cares.

52:59.075 --> 53:00.699
The woman is bleeding.

53:00.700 --> 53:03.866
Your friend here fucked
her and he doesn't care.

53:03.867 --> 53:07.032
If nobody kills anyone then we
ruin the purpose of the game.

53:07.033 --> 53:09.907
You still don't
believe this is real?

53:09.908 --> 53:14.532
I believe this is a test and we can win
if we show we have the power to say no.

53:14.533 --> 53:20.186
Power is domination, control,
and a truth that is a lie.

53:20.742 --> 53:24.890
Please... end this...

53:25.700 --> 53:30.180
You just need to
tell me who you are.

53:31.200 --> 53:33.476
I'm the actress.

53:37.700 --> 53:39.963
I thought so.

53:45.825 --> 53:48.599
No! No! No... no...

54:05.575 --> 54:09.206
I thought you would try
and save your lady.

54:09.450 --> 54:11.856
She's not my lady.

54:12.325 --> 54:15.616
You are a monster,
you are a monster!

54:15.617 --> 54:19.101
Relax, it's only a game.

54:25.908 --> 54:28.949
Aah... what if she lied?

54:28.950 --> 54:31.213
Let's get out of here.

54:32.158 --> 54:33.907
Where are you going?

54:33.908 --> 54:37.330
Don't you want to know
if I win or lose?

54:39.075 --> 54:41.199
So what do you think? Huh?

54:41.200 --> 54:46.356
She was in pain, what reason
would she have to lie to me?

54:47.575 --> 54:50.065
None, right?

55:05.533 --> 55:09.729
How do you think this works?
We just touch it?

55:20.617 --> 55:22.940
What if nobody died?

55:23.575 --> 55:25.898
We'll never know.

55:26.908 --> 55:29.564
What are we going to do?

55:32.450 --> 55:34.713
I don't know,

55:36.658 --> 55:41.055
maybe we can have some fun...

55:58.408 --> 55:59.949
She lied.

55:59.950 --> 56:02.936
Yeah... she was the singer.

56:07.242 --> 56:11.390
And our friend here was
the African president.

56:13.742 --> 56:16.598
And a fanatic catholic...

56:18.492 --> 56:20.754
What now?

56:22.200 --> 56:24.463
Now?

56:25.117 --> 56:28.270
We have another hour to kill...

56:32.617 --> 56:34.879
Thank you.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.157
What for?

56:37.158 --> 56:42.646
If you knew who she was you would
have more chances to know who I am.

56:42.950 --> 56:46.648
I told you, I don't want to know.

56:46.950 --> 56:50.683
Yes, we don't want to know.

57:10.950 --> 57:14.949
We have to stay together,
away from the others.

57:14.950 --> 57:20.023
You're right, only you and me.

58:33.950 --> 58:36.854
I hate waiting.

58:39.950 --> 58:44.809
Yes, you're a very patient person.

58:46.492 --> 58:48.754
Yes, I am.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.532
Do you know what's more
exciting about this?

58:54.533 --> 58:56.657
Not knowing if you're
a man or a woman.

58:56.658 --> 59:00.641
Labels are for clothing,
not for people.

59:11.450 --> 59:13.713
Are you asleep?

59:21.992 --> 59:24.433
Tell me who you are.

59:45.783 --> 59:50.741
Don't worry, Mr. Battier...
We had a little technical problem.

59:50.742 --> 59:54.324
So this is real? Am I really young?

59:54.325 --> 59:55.991
Yes, you are.

59:55.992 --> 01:00:00.637
And if you win the game you
will stay forever young.

01:00:02.825 --> 01:00:04.741
It's good to be young.

01:00:04.742 --> 01:00:07.148
Yes, it is.

01:00:09.492 --> 01:00:11.991
We're sorry, this wasn't
supposed to happen

01:00:11.992 --> 01:00:15.741
but you should be back in the
game without any more problems

01:00:15.742 --> 01:00:18.491
and hopefully you won't
remember this...

01:00:18.492 --> 01:00:21.266
Wait, tell me something...

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:25.491
How do I know if this is true
or just some kind of dream?

01:00:25.492 --> 01:00:27.815
You will find out.

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:35.808
Is good to be young.

01:00:43.908 --> 01:00:46.350
Is good to be young.

01:00:57.783 --> 01:01:00.046
How you feel?

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:04.407
Did something happen?

01:01:04.408 --> 01:01:05.574
Like what?

01:01:05.575 --> 01:01:07.449
To me, did something happen to me?

01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:11.657
You fell asleep... oh, you
were talking in your sleep.

01:01:11.658 --> 01:01:13.199
What did I say?

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:17.824
You said "this is real?"
And "am I really young"

01:01:17.825 --> 01:01:21.317
and then you said "wait"
and you woke up.

01:01:21.742 --> 01:01:23.491
I said "wait"? I just said "wait"?

01:01:23.492 --> 01:01:25.754
Yes.

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:29.558
What did you dream of?

01:01:30.783 --> 01:01:32.407
I wasn't dreaming.

01:01:32.408 --> 01:01:34.671
What was it then?

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.395
This is really happening.

01:01:39.533 --> 01:01:40.949
What happened?

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:44.232
What did you see that
made you change?

01:01:45.367 --> 01:01:48.440
I think it's better if we split up.

01:01:49.492 --> 01:01:52.147
Are you breaking up with me?

01:01:52.158 --> 01:01:54.491
I think this is for the best.

01:01:54.492 --> 01:01:56.282
Are you sure?

01:01:56.283 --> 01:01:58.974
Yes, I'm sure.

01:02:01.325 --> 01:02:03.782
You don't want to do this,
you don't want to do this...

01:02:03.783 --> 01:02:04.907
you know I like you.

01:02:04.908 --> 01:02:06.074
Oh really?!

01:02:06.075 --> 01:02:08.574
You know, you didn't
have to act with me.

01:02:08.575 --> 01:02:09.949
I know who you are.

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:12.866
No, maybe that's because I'm not
the one who has been acting.

01:02:12.867 --> 01:02:14.616
Am I acting?

01:02:14.617 --> 01:02:17.449
Maybe I'm the Russian military
guy with combat training...

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:21.657
The only combat training you've had is
"stage combat" for theater and film...

01:02:21.658 --> 01:02:23.241
Do you think you know who I am?

01:02:23.242 --> 01:02:24.324
What about me?

01:02:24.325 --> 01:02:25.741
Are you really sure
you know who I am?

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:28.004
Yes, I am.

01:03:26.617 --> 01:03:28.879
Hey!

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.523
Did somebody die?

01:03:31.992 --> 01:03:34.350
Where is your woman?

01:04:57.992 --> 01:05:00.564
What are you doing here?

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:03.517
Did you kill somebody?

01:05:05.533 --> 01:05:07.796
Which one?

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:10.213
Tell me!

01:05:10.742 --> 01:05:16.597
I know who you are and I saw what
you did with that woman... guy.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.622
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.390
I don't know if we can kill
two people in one hour,

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:32.192
get ready, you're next.

01:05:45.367 --> 01:05:48.271
Hey! Where are you going?

01:05:48.742 --> 01:05:50.824
Nowhere.

01:05:50.825 --> 01:05:53.088
What's that?

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.225
Did you kill someone else?

01:05:56.867 --> 01:05:59.116
I didn't kill anybody.

01:05:59.117 --> 01:06:05.282
I saw you in that room choosing the
footballer hologram, I know you killed him.

01:06:05.283 --> 01:06:07.574
You're crazy,
I couldn't kill anyone.

01:06:07.575 --> 01:06:11.143
And I'm pretty sure
I know who you are.

01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:16.347
You play so many games and
you're good at acting!

01:06:16.867 --> 01:06:19.771
You can only be the actress!

01:06:22.867 --> 01:06:25.190
Did you hear this?

01:06:56.075 --> 01:06:58.600
Where's the computer geek?

01:06:58.783 --> 01:07:02.116
What happened to the
actress hologram?

01:07:02.117 --> 01:07:04.475
Somebody killed her.

01:07:04.867 --> 01:07:07.392
Maybe the computer geek?

01:07:08.867 --> 01:07:11.241
Why do you think the
computer geek killed her?

01:07:11.242 --> 01:07:14.063
We saw him coming in here.

01:07:15.658 --> 01:07:17.921
Oh, I see,

01:07:19.617 --> 01:07:22.272
you killed someone...

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:25.741
you killed someone and you
have no idea who you killed.

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:29.032
I killed the actress, someone
has gone ahead before me

01:07:29.033 --> 01:07:31.407
and picked the right hologram.

01:07:31.408 --> 01:07:34.824
Why? Can there be two
deaths in the same hour?

01:07:34.825 --> 01:07:36.657
I don't know.

01:07:36.658 --> 01:07:39.532
Where are the rules for this shit?

01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:41.866
Why are you so nervous?

01:07:41.867 --> 01:07:44.032
You have fifty-fifty chance.

01:07:44.033 --> 01:07:47.056
Shut up, and let me focus!

01:08:25.158 --> 01:08:27.517
Leave me alone...

01:08:31.533 --> 01:08:33.796
So,

01:08:35.783 --> 01:08:40.578
the computer geek
killed the actress.

01:08:41.805 --> 01:08:45.407
There's only one woman left.

01:08:45.408 --> 01:08:47.731
If she is a woman.

01:08:51.408 --> 01:08:54.774
And we haven't killed anybody yet.

01:08:55.825 --> 01:08:58.616
We're missing all the fun...

01:08:58.617 --> 01:09:03.014
Don't worry, there'll be
plenty of opportunities...

01:09:03.658 --> 01:09:06.645
We should read these bios again.

01:09:07.117 --> 01:09:11.585
I don't want to happen to me
what happened to this guy.

01:09:15.908 --> 01:09:18.353
Hey, where are you going?

01:09:18.575 --> 01:09:21.782
Another hour has gone by, who died?

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:23.116
Does it matter?

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:24.948
You have to keep track of that.

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:26.698
What for?

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.366
You're going to try to kill me?

01:09:28.367 --> 01:09:30.892
I don't know who you are.

01:09:33.408 --> 01:09:35.198
I know you.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:40.282
Maybe you're the humanitarian...
you're not going to kill anybody.

01:09:40.283 --> 01:09:42.546
You sure?

01:09:46.158 --> 01:09:48.698
Where's the woman who was
following you around?

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.962
Did you kill her?

01:10:01.283 --> 01:10:03.574
We're all turning into
animals, aren't we?

01:10:03.575 --> 01:10:04.741
I'm just trying to survive.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:05.907
Aren't we all?

01:10:05.908 --> 01:10:12.059
For me, survive means not dying, it
doesn't necessarily mean I have to kill.

01:10:13.575 --> 01:10:15.838
Well,

01:10:16.742 --> 01:10:19.847
we don't always have that option.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:26.116
If this is a video game there
should be bonuses, right?

01:10:26.117 --> 01:10:28.116
Hidden weapons, food,
health packages...

01:10:28.117 --> 01:10:29.782
This isn't a video game.

01:10:29.783 --> 01:10:31.574
But it is a game?

01:10:31.575 --> 01:10:33.491
If it's not a game it
sure looks like a game.

01:10:33.492 --> 01:10:35.199
- Have you found anything?
- No.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.991
Then it's a shitty game.

01:10:36.992 --> 01:10:38.699
You bet.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.782
Just tell me who died!

01:10:40.783 --> 01:10:43.074
What have you got to lose?

01:10:43.075 --> 01:10:46.157
And what if we go
and kill the geek?

01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:48.282
You really think it's him?

01:10:48.283 --> 01:10:50.282
We could try to find out.

01:10:50.283 --> 01:10:52.532
What if you are the computer geek?

01:10:52.533 --> 01:10:54.532
Why do you say that?

01:10:54.533 --> 01:10:58.116
The one you call the geek, is the
only one who had a girlfriend.

01:10:58.117 --> 01:10:59.532
Maybe he's the playboy.

01:10:59.533 --> 01:11:02.536
- Come on, you also got laid.
- Yah.

01:11:02.575 --> 01:11:08.509
So I could be the playboy, trying to
make you wrongfully kill the other guy?

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:11.023
It's a possibility.

01:11:15.783 --> 01:11:19.199
Let's find the other guy anyway and
see what he has to say about himself.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.824
We need to be careful.

01:11:20.825 --> 01:11:24.004
- Why?
- He killed already.

01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:28.434
He could be the Russian
killing machine.

01:11:30.242 --> 01:11:33.856
But we're two against
one, let's go.

01:11:45.575 --> 01:11:47.699
Hey...

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.023
what are you doing?

01:11:51.825 --> 01:11:55.037
I'm trying to get
to the other side.

01:11:55.158 --> 01:11:57.683
I don't think you can.

01:12:19.117 --> 01:12:21.532
You've just saved my life.

01:12:21.533 --> 01:12:24.324
Group meeting and
we weren't invited?

01:12:24.325 --> 01:12:27.116
The humanitarian geek
here just saved my life.

01:12:27.117 --> 01:12:31.229
Oh really? Tell us about it.

01:12:34.408 --> 01:12:39.199
If you all kill me, how are you going
to know who's responsible for my death?

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.699
Only one person can
identify the hologram.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.351
What? You expect us to lynch you?

01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:54.157
We don't actually know if the game will
kill anybody if we don't do it ourselves.

01:12:54.158 --> 01:12:57.491
Yes we do, the first
kill was the game...

01:12:57.492 --> 01:13:00.116
The first kill was
Maria, the lesbian.

01:13:00.117 --> 01:13:02.574
I saw her throw the
other against the wall.

01:13:02.575 --> 01:13:06.806
He's right. I saw her
identifying the hologram.

01:13:07.575 --> 01:13:09.407
What do you suggest?

01:13:09.408 --> 01:13:13.532
We stand down for the next hour
and see if the game really kills?

01:13:13.533 --> 01:13:16.023
What have we got to lose?

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:20.271
Ok, it will be like
playing Russian roulette.

01:13:20.367 --> 01:13:24.905
Let's go to the swimming pool
and wait out the next hour.

01:13:25.158 --> 01:13:28.429
It is as risky as
trying to kill me.

01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:35.058
Kill him, or wait for the hour?

01:13:53.117 --> 01:13:54.824
10 minutes.

01:13:54.825 --> 01:13:59.643
When you woke up in the game
center, did you see the others?

01:14:00.158 --> 01:14:01.366
No.

01:14:01.367 --> 01:14:03.951
What are you talking about?

01:14:05.242 --> 01:14:08.347
I woke up in the game center.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.732
This is... this is all true.

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:16.241
That's why you killed the actress?

01:14:16.242 --> 01:14:18.504
She attacked me.

01:14:18.742 --> 01:14:20.741
But you knew who she was?

01:14:20.742 --> 01:14:22.949
I had an intuition.

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:25.699
You're saying you made a
guess and you got lucky?

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:28.604
Luck is all part of the game.

01:14:52.158 --> 01:14:54.421
Almost time:

01:14:55.450 --> 01:15:03.059
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

01:15:21.575 --> 01:15:23.838
So,

01:15:24.533 --> 01:15:26.796
what now?

01:15:27.575 --> 01:15:30.997
In the last hour there
were two deaths.

01:15:31.033 --> 01:15:33.949
Must have given us an
hour credit without a kill.

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:37.139
That's why you were so confident?

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.622
What's your suggestion
for the next hour?

01:15:42.367 --> 01:15:45.858
We aren't all thinking
the same thing...

01:15:46.367 --> 01:15:49.141
I know what I have to do.

01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:07.555
I'm coming back for all of you.

01:16:08.575 --> 01:16:11.065
I'll be waiting.

01:16:40.158 --> 01:16:43.773
You can run but you can't hide!

01:16:46.575 --> 01:16:50.190
Don't be afraid!
This is only a game!

01:16:51.783 --> 01:16:54.046
Come out!

01:16:54.492 --> 01:16:56.574
Behave like a Queen!

01:16:56.575 --> 01:17:01.951
A member of the royal family should
face her execution with dignity!

01:17:04.367 --> 01:17:07.271
Be a lady and face death!

01:17:09.033 --> 01:17:11.309
There you are.

01:17:13.117 --> 01:17:16.616
So you finally decided
to give up running away.

01:17:16.617 --> 01:17:19.852
No, I've decided to play.

01:17:20.742 --> 01:17:22.116
Excellent.

01:17:22.117 --> 01:17:24.532
You're not used to
video games, are you?

01:17:24.533 --> 01:17:26.616
I prefer real games.

01:17:26.617 --> 01:17:30.199
If you played video games you'd
know that there were areas

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.450
where you could find bonuses,

01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:38.081
like health packages,
food or weapons.

01:17:38.117 --> 01:17:42.004
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

01:17:44.575 --> 01:17:46.981
Did you find anything?

01:17:47.825 --> 01:17:50.087
You bet.

01:17:56.283 --> 01:17:58.241
That's not fair.

01:17:58.242 --> 01:18:00.849
It's all about the game.

01:18:01.533 --> 01:18:04.224
So you know who I am then?

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:07.213
No.

01:18:09.825 --> 01:18:15.597
So you have the power
to kill me but you can't.

01:18:16.783 --> 01:18:18.491
I don't know it yet.

01:18:18.492 --> 01:18:22.491
But I have a whole
hour to find out.

01:18:22.492 --> 01:18:25.099
That's what you think.

01:18:35.117 --> 01:18:37.379
Who has a gun?

01:18:38.908 --> 01:18:42.699
In video games there are hidden weapons
in obscure corners and secret rooms.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.142
We looked everywhere.

01:18:45.867 --> 01:18:51.452
I don't know about you guys but I'm
not going to wait here to find out.

01:19:03.325 --> 01:19:07.657
I've never been shot before but
I can imagine how painful that is.

01:19:07.658 --> 01:19:13.809
So, why don't you tell me who you are
and I will spare you the suffering.

01:19:14.075 --> 01:19:19.660
Or you can spend the next 50 minutes
of your life in excruciating pain!

01:19:19.825 --> 01:19:21.574
You're so naive!

01:19:21.575 --> 01:19:23.074
Really?

01:19:23.075 --> 01:19:27.116
All I have to do is
give you the wrong name

01:19:27.117 --> 01:19:32.474
and you'll die when you touch the
hologram, like the other guy.

01:19:36.492 --> 01:19:37.699
You're right.

01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:40.474
I'm going to kill the geek.

01:20:26.492 --> 01:20:29.894
Hey there, your royal highness!

01:20:31.742 --> 01:20:35.605
He who controls others
may be powerful,

01:20:36.533 --> 01:20:43.810
but he who has mastered
himself is mightier still!

01:20:53.867 --> 01:20:56.936
What the hell are you doing?

01:20:57.158 --> 01:21:00.726
Good luck in finding
out who I am...

01:21:13.158 --> 01:21:15.421
What the fuck!

01:21:17.242 --> 01:21:19.324
That's not right!

01:21:19.325 --> 01:21:22.866
I didn't kill you so I don't have
to identify your body, right?

01:21:22.867 --> 01:21:25.936
Fuck! Oh Jesus.

01:21:26.867 --> 01:21:29.129
Fuck!

01:21:42.783 --> 01:21:45.032
Where did you find this?

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:47.523
It was inside a box.

01:21:49.408 --> 01:21:53.521
Did you know the Chinese
was a real China man?

01:21:55.075 --> 01:21:57.766
I'm so stupid!

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.437
Are you going to kill me?

01:22:07.825 --> 01:22:09.866
I'd rather do something
else with you.

01:22:09.867 --> 01:22:12.723
Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't be afraid!

01:22:12.783 --> 01:22:15.824
Didn't you listen what
the other guy said?

01:22:15.825 --> 01:22:22.190
When we die we go back to the future
where our old bodies wait for us.

01:22:22.367 --> 01:22:25.199
Let's enjoy our youth while we can.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.699
No way. But thanks.

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:32.241
Thanks? Thanks for what?

01:22:32.242 --> 01:22:34.657
Now I'm certain of who you are.

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:39.648
Oh, great! So tell me...
huh? Who am I?

01:22:39.658 --> 01:22:43.741
I've seen the way you look at
women and how shocked you were

01:22:43.742 --> 01:22:46.616
when you discovered one
of them was really a man.

01:22:46.617 --> 01:22:49.722
Oh... yeah, that's true.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:58.683
Anyway, I'm the one
who has the gun.

01:22:59.492 --> 01:23:03.604
And I'm the one who
has the bullets.

01:23:09.242 --> 01:23:11.504
Fuck!

01:23:17.617 --> 01:23:19.699
Looks unloaded, ah?

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:22.225
I've got the bullets.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.074
Let's make a deal?

01:23:25.075 --> 01:23:26.991
What kind of deal?

01:23:26.992 --> 01:23:31.282
You give me the bullets so we
can get rid of both of them,

01:23:31.283 --> 01:23:36.450
enjoy together our last few hours
in these young beautiful bodies

01:23:37.117 --> 01:23:39.379
and, at the end,

01:23:40.658 --> 01:23:45.731
we can still play Russian roulette
to decide who wins. Okay?

01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:52.267
Give me the bullets.

01:23:54.825 --> 01:23:56.532
Do we have a deal?

01:23:56.533 --> 01:23:58.796
We'll see.

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:09.324
Hey! Wait! Wait up!

01:24:09.325 --> 01:24:12.229
Let's talk! Hey! I mean it!

01:24:12.867 --> 01:24:15.129
Wait.

01:24:25.158 --> 01:24:28.032
No, no, no... don't go,
don't go, wait.

01:24:28.033 --> 01:24:30.392
Stay here with me!

01:24:33.367 --> 01:24:37.556
Are you sure you don't want
to sit here next to me?

01:24:37.617 --> 01:24:40.324
You don't give up easily, do you?

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:43.430
I just hate to see beauty wasted.

01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:56.267
<i>Olha, que coisa mais linda
mais cheia de graça...</i>

01:24:56.867 --> 01:25:02.390
<i>é essa menina que
vem e que passa...</i>

01:25:36.492 --> 01:25:40.688
Ideas are more powerful
than guns, aren't they?

01:25:41.867 --> 01:25:48.407
We would not let our enemies have guns,
why should we let them have ideas?

01:25:48.408 --> 01:25:52.190
That's very interesting,
who said that?

01:25:52.408 --> 01:25:54.449
Are you trying to guess who I am?

01:25:54.450 --> 01:25:58.360
Since everyone seems to
be certain of who I am.

01:25:59.033 --> 01:26:02.269
So, I'm not the computer geek.

01:26:02.533 --> 01:26:04.491
I know who you are.

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:06.754
Are you sure?

01:26:08.575 --> 01:26:10.657
And that doesn't scare you?

01:26:10.658 --> 01:26:12.921
No.

01:26:13.283 --> 01:26:15.866
Because you don't know who I am.

01:26:15.867 --> 01:26:17.324
You think so?

01:26:17.325 --> 01:26:19.815
Remember the actress?

01:26:21.617 --> 01:26:24.023
She's down there.

01:26:25.617 --> 01:26:29.407
Why would a computer geek kill a
good-looking girl who was into him?

01:26:29.408 --> 01:26:31.074
Self-defense, you said that.

01:26:31.075 --> 01:26:32.991
And you believe me?

01:26:32.992 --> 01:26:35.657
The playboy wouldn't
kill her either.

01:26:35.658 --> 01:26:38.157
Unless he got tired of her.

01:26:38.158 --> 01:26:40.741
The playboy isn't the only
one who is still alive.

01:26:40.742 --> 01:26:43.366
You're trying to suggest
that you are the princess?

01:26:43.367 --> 01:26:48.226
I'm just trying to say that I
could be anyone except you.

01:26:49.742 --> 01:26:53.032
Ok! Let's say that you are
the princess, for a second.

01:26:53.033 --> 01:26:55.866
Why did you choose a man's body?

01:26:55.867 --> 01:26:58.991
She is a rebel, against
her own royal condition,

01:26:58.992 --> 01:27:01.991
her family, unstable, independent.

01:27:01.992 --> 01:27:04.616
Turning into a man could
be her liberation.

01:27:04.617 --> 01:27:06.741
What are you trying to prove?

01:27:06.742 --> 01:27:09.765
Think twice before you kill me.

01:27:11.825 --> 01:27:16.433
You don't want to get it wrong
at this point of the game.

01:27:16.908 --> 01:27:21.586
Why don't we go back to see
if the others are still alive?

01:27:22.075 --> 01:27:25.574
We have time for our
final confrontation.

01:27:25.575 --> 01:27:29.834
Thought you said ideas were
more powerful than guns.

01:27:30.283 --> 01:27:32.855
You still have a weapon.

01:27:36.867 --> 01:27:39.641
Is this good enough for you?

01:27:42.867 --> 01:27:45.172
- You walk in front!
- No.

01:27:45.825 --> 01:27:50.566
We walk side by side, you
still can be the Russian guy.

01:27:50.783 --> 01:27:53.074
Anybody can have karate lessons...

01:27:53.075 --> 01:27:56.706
- Even the princess...
- Even the princess...

01:28:07.617 --> 01:28:09.879
How do you feel?

01:28:14.325 --> 01:28:16.588
You want to bet?

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.157
On what?

01:28:19.158 --> 01:28:22.032
Which one of them will come back...

01:28:22.033 --> 01:28:24.296
I don't care.

01:28:24.492 --> 01:28:26.699
It's just for fun.

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:30.268
I had enough fun for
one day already.

01:28:30.783 --> 01:28:32.241
I totally got it.

01:28:32.242 --> 01:28:33.866
What?

01:28:33.867 --> 01:28:36.273
You're not a woman.

01:28:37.825 --> 01:28:39.032
Why do you say that?

01:28:39.033 --> 01:28:40.824
You're not a woman!

01:28:40.825 --> 01:28:44.666
That's why you didn't
want to have sex with me.

01:28:46.783 --> 01:28:49.046
You admit it?

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.282
I don't have to.

01:28:51.283 --> 01:28:53.773
Think what you want.

01:28:53.783 --> 01:28:56.046
Hey guys!

01:28:56.617 --> 01:28:58.866
Which one of you has the gun?

01:28:58.867 --> 01:29:03.311
No one. He decided to
throw it in the lake.

01:29:03.658 --> 01:29:08.366
If there was a gun in the game,
there can be other things.

01:29:08.367 --> 01:29:11.998
What you need right
now is a first aid kit.

01:29:12.992 --> 01:29:15.032
You're bleeding a lot.

01:29:15.033 --> 01:29:17.074
Doesn't it hurt?

01:29:17.075 --> 01:29:19.338
Not really.

01:29:20.283 --> 01:29:22.546
Can you move?

01:29:27.033 --> 01:29:29.973
Per... fec... tly... fine...

01:29:39.533 --> 01:29:41.940
She's not a woman.

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.866
Is he dead?

01:30:04.867 --> 01:30:07.657
Hum... hum, it looks like it.

01:30:07.658 --> 01:30:09.324
Shit.

01:30:09.325 --> 01:30:13.584
You've got ten minutes left,
to choose the hologram.

01:30:13.617 --> 01:30:17.066
That's easy, I'll do it now.

01:30:19.867 --> 01:30:22.324
It would be nice if you
get the right one.

01:30:22.325 --> 01:30:26.282
Why are you so interested in
weather I get it right or not?

01:30:26.283 --> 01:30:31.657
If you fail you die too and it's between
me and the killing machine here.

01:30:31.658 --> 01:30:33.921
He's the Russian?

01:30:34.117 --> 01:30:35.366
I think so.

01:30:35.367 --> 01:30:36.824
But he doesn't know who you are?

01:30:36.825 --> 01:30:39.088
No.

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:41.282
And you really don't have the gun?

01:30:41.283 --> 01:30:42.824
No.

01:30:42.825 --> 01:30:45.087
Too bad...

01:30:53.367 --> 01:30:58.991
Well, if I've been counting the time
right, we got a couple of hours more

01:30:58.992 --> 01:31:01.978
without having to kill anybody.

01:31:03.242 --> 01:31:06.324
What do you want to do, an orgy?

01:31:06.325 --> 01:31:08.932
Yes! Do you?

01:31:09.158 --> 01:31:11.683
Go fuck yourselves.

01:31:20.992 --> 01:31:25.389
I'm going to take care of
her, we'll meet later.

01:31:32.408 --> 01:31:34.671
No...

01:31:38.867 --> 01:31:41.129
We won't.

01:32:38.117 --> 01:32:40.379
Fuck!

01:32:45.492 --> 01:32:49.681
Do you really think you
were going to find the gun?

01:32:52.158 --> 01:32:54.600
What else could I do?

01:32:54.658 --> 01:32:56.981
Could come with me.

01:32:57.825 --> 01:33:00.199
What makes you think you're
any different from the others?

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.157
I already said no.

01:33:02.158 --> 01:33:05.199
We both know who we are and we
both know that we're decent people.

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.407
Oh, really?

01:33:06.408 --> 01:33:09.157
Was it decent of you
to kill your girlfriend?

01:33:09.158 --> 01:33:13.271
It was self-defense,
she tried to kill me.

01:33:14.992 --> 01:33:17.532
How do I know you're
not going to kill me.

01:33:17.533 --> 01:33:20.282
Trust me, I will not kill you.

01:33:20.283 --> 01:33:24.147
I want to stay young for
as long as possible.

01:33:25.617 --> 01:33:27.879
Ok then.

01:33:29.742 --> 01:33:34.001
And how are we going to spend
the time we have left?

01:33:34.617 --> 01:33:36.879
I'm not sure,

01:33:38.867 --> 01:33:41.129
you tell me.

01:33:57.533 --> 01:34:02.616
Let's go take care of the Russian guy,
then we can have some fun together.

01:34:02.617 --> 01:34:08.270
No need. I already
took care of him.

01:34:20.408 --> 01:34:22.815
<i>What happens now?</i>

01:34:23.408 --> 01:34:24.366
<i>I won.</i>

01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:25.866
Shall we?

01:34:25.867 --> 01:34:27.491
<i>I won the game, right?</i>

01:34:27.492 --> 01:34:30.478
Yes. Let's play the hardest part.

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:08.558
Congratulations.

01:35:12.783 --> 01:35:18.824
I want to be forever young in this body
and I don't care how much it will cost.

01:35:18.825 --> 01:35:21.949
I told you we're not sure if we
can keep your brain in that body

01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:25.232
for more than the
time you have left.

01:35:25.450 --> 01:35:29.978
You know, I'm a very rich man

01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:34.959
but I prefer to be young and
poor than old and rich.

01:35:35.117 --> 01:35:37.440
How much Mr. Chan?

01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:40.366
I'm not sure.

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:44.741
We'd have to keep this entire
structure just for you.

01:35:44.742 --> 01:35:47.598
Give me a number, Mr. Chan.

01:35:50.533 --> 01:35:54.433
If you insist, I can try.

01:35:55.492 --> 01:35:58.991
But I'm not sure how long
we can keep it working.

01:35:58.992 --> 01:36:03.271
I'll take that risk. How much?

01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:32.312
I hope I won't regret this.

01:36:32.408 --> 01:36:34.980
I'm sure you won't.

01:37:12.492 --> 01:37:14.754
Young again?

01:37:14.992 --> 01:37:17.324
Are you sure you can do it?

01:37:17.325 --> 01:37:19.850
Yes, I can.

01:37:20.075 --> 01:37:23.241
You know... I'm old and thick.

01:37:23.242 --> 01:37:26.407
I have nothing
to lose. I will do it!

01:37:26.408 --> 01:37:29.282
Yes, sir. You won't regret it, sir.

01:37:29.283 --> 01:37:31.866
It will be an ultimate experience.

01:37:31.867 --> 01:37:35.157
I'll get in touch with you again
so we can settle all the details.

01:37:35.158 --> 01:37:37.421
Okay, then.

01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:46.921
We did it!

01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:53.532
I still don't know how you do it.

01:37:53.533 --> 01:37:55.741
I'm a kind of priest.

01:37:55.742 --> 01:38:00.056
They want to believe and
I help them believe.

01:38:01.450 --> 01:38:05.316
- Next time I want to play the Gamekeeper.
- Oh, no, no, you can't.

01:38:05.317 --> 01:38:07.616
I've talked to him so he knows me.

01:38:07.617 --> 01:38:12.808
Why do men always have to get
the best parts? It's not fair.

01:38:20.658 --> 01:38:22.241
Turn it on.

01:38:22.242 --> 01:38:24.504
Excuse me, sir?

01:38:24.783 --> 01:38:27.046
Turn it on...

01:38:32.867 --> 01:38:35.129
Louder...

01:38:38.158 --> 01:38:40.434
I like it!
