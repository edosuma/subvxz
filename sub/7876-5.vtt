Synchro: Koni, mpm

00:38.193 --> 00:41.930
{\pos(192,185)}Debbie, how I've missed
your juicy beanbag-chair lips.

00:42.055 --> 00:45.236
{\pos(192,185)}- Let's not ever break up again.
- Never again.

00:48.967 --> 00:52.050
This would be awkward if we had
any semblance of social skills.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.927
They're making puberty.

00:54.499 --> 00:58.390
{\pos(192,220)}Gentlemen, you remember the Debster,
the D train, the Deb-a-leb-ding-dong.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.344
{\pos(192,220)}Steve, we're here to debate

01:00.469 --> 01:03.059
{\pos(192,220)}which futuristic sci-fi costumes
we'll be wearing

01:03.233 --> 01:05.814
{\pos(192,220)}to mess with those losers
at the Renaissance Fair.

01:05.984 --> 01:08.983
{\pos(192,220)}Was that this period?
Guess it slipped my mind.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.277
{\pos(192,220)}It's cool. I need
to get to biology anyway.

01:15.402 --> 01:16.526
{\pos(192,220)}See ya, guys.

01:16.832 --> 01:20.528
{\pos(192,220)}We narrowed our choices down
to "Viper Pilots from Galactica,"

01:20.653 --> 01:23.231
{\pos(192,220)}Pre-crime Cops
from Minority Report,"or...

01:24.102 --> 01:25.102
{\pos(192,220)}Steve?

01:25.650 --> 01:27.947
{\pos(192,220)}Debbie's really packing it on?

01:35.383 --> 01:36.524
Thirsty.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.178
Hang on.

02:00.144 --> 02:01.693
Buffaloes rules!

02:06.753 --> 02:08.877
The student council
bought a buffalo?

02:09.047 --> 02:10.140
Look, everybody,

02:10.265 --> 02:12.434
Steve Smith's got a buffalo, too.

02:14.833 --> 02:17.254
{\pos(192,220)}My girlfriend doesn't walk
on hooves, madam.

02:17.379 --> 02:18.626
{\pos(192,220)}And as far as I know,

02:18.751 --> 02:20.817
{\pos(192,220)}she's never been hunted
near extinction!

02:20.942 --> 02:23.035
{\pos(192,220)}That's right.
Say words.

02:23.222 --> 02:24.350
{\pos(192,220)}Forget it, Steve.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.562
{\pos(192,220)}- But...
- Don't stoop to their level.

02:26.687 --> 02:29.810
{\pos(192,220)}I can't believe what this school
is coming to under Lisa's leadership.

02:29.935 --> 02:32.098
{\pos(192,220)}Last week I was
at a mandatory pep rally,

02:32.223 --> 02:35.009
and they threatened to kick my ass
because I wouldn't give them an O.

02:35.134 --> 02:37.947
I mean, I just gave them a G.
What, am I made of letters?

02:38.117 --> 02:40.374
It's frustrating,
but what are you gonna do?

02:42.882 --> 02:46.719
Debbie, the solution has been
right under my Keds this whole time.

02:46.844 --> 02:48.991
You could run for
student council president!

02:49.116 --> 02:50.752
Me? That's ridiculous.

02:50.922 --> 02:53.260
You represent
the disenfranchised masses:

02:53.385 --> 02:55.715
the nerds, the dweebs, the spasses.

02:55.971 --> 02:57.806
Together, we're unstoppable.

02:57.931 --> 03:00.171
Not the best-looking group,
but unstoppable.

03:00.296 --> 03:02.933
Look, Steve, politics
just isn't my thing.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.391
Let's get to Biology.
It's fetal pig day.

03:05.561 --> 03:08.353
Sorry, no fetal pigs this year.
Couldn't afford them.

03:09.315 --> 03:11.738
Student council shifted money
from the science department

03:11.863 --> 03:14.234
so they could hire
a pricey buffalo groomer.

03:14.404 --> 03:16.123
So we've got a live buffalo,

03:16.248 --> 03:18.217
but no dead baby pigs?
That's it.

03:18.342 --> 03:19.982
I'm running for president.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.172
Has anybody seen that buffalo?

03:22.297 --> 03:24.366
If I'm gonna get his highlights in
by tomorrow,

03:24.491 --> 03:26.287
I've got to get him
in the chair now.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.166
<i>And so, fellow students,</i>

03:30.415 --> 03:32.655
<i>when you cast your vote
for class president,</i>

03:32.780 --> 03:33.924
<i>keep me in mind.</i>

03:34.049 --> 03:35.780
<i>I may not understand your obsession</i>

03:35.905 --> 03:38.296
<i>with a 30-year-old
British TV show...</i>

03:39.512 --> 03:42.717
<i>or the challenges facing
Christian weightlifters...</i>

03:43.891 --> 03:46.850
<i>or the goals of the League
of Redheaded Gentlemen.</i>

03:48.642 --> 03:52.243
<i>But I do understand how it feels
to be a powerless outcast.</i>

03:52.368 --> 03:54.932
<i>We all deserve a voice
in student government.</i>

03:55.057 --> 03:57.468
<i>I hope you'll let me be that voice.</i>

03:57.948 --> 03:58.987
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:00.678 --> 04:02.155
That was good.
Not great.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.173
You forgot to pander
to the Eagle Scouts,

04:04.298 --> 04:07.105
we can plant a story in the school paper
saying you collect compasses.

04:07.230 --> 04:09.370
I know a reporter.
He owes me.

04:09.495 --> 04:11.457
Hello. "Competition",

04:11.695 --> 04:14.235
what are you trying to
prove running against me?

04:14.360 --> 04:17.454
You should know that you're opening
yourself up to ridicule.

04:17.579 --> 04:19.632
There are some mean people
at this school.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.814
Is that a threat?
You gonna sling some mud?

04:21.939 --> 04:24.056
We can sling it right back, sister.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.265
You want to get nuts?!
Come on! Let's get nuts.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.464
No, Steve.

04:28.589 --> 04:29.560
When we win,

04:29.685 --> 04:32.744
a fiscally sound marching band
will be our response.

04:32.886 --> 04:35.900
Till then, enjoy this "Vote
for Debbie" windshield scraper.

04:37.148 --> 04:39.777
We're gonna destroy you,
you fat cow!

04:40.238 --> 04:43.134
Where is this fat cow?
I have some fresh new styles

04:43.259 --> 04:45.408
that can get any bovine
ready for summer.

04:48.039 --> 04:49.616
Happy birthday, buddy.

04:54.810 --> 04:58.399
Steve, I knew you wouldn't
miss my birthday party!

04:58.524 --> 04:59.574
Birthday party?

04:59.699 --> 05:03.038
Right. You know who will stand up
for birthday parties?

05:03.163 --> 05:05.549
Debbie. And she sure could
use your vote tomorrow.

05:05.674 --> 05:07.617
- Take some literature.
- Slow down.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.637
Barry was about to blow out
his candles.

05:09.762 --> 05:12.018
I've been practicing not spitting.

05:12.237 --> 05:14.598
No time. I still have
to go canvass the chess team,

05:14.723 --> 05:17.382
the Baggy Pants Mafia and
the Jews who run the AV Club.

05:17.507 --> 05:19.990
I'm running on fumes, man.
Vote Debbie!

05:20.997 --> 05:23.544
This is the worst Christmas ever.

05:29.676 --> 05:32.218
School paper just called
the boy's locker room for Lisa.

05:32.343 --> 05:34.052
We expected that, but the exit polls

05:34.177 --> 05:36.431
from the math department
are trending in our direction.

05:36.556 --> 05:39.340
We did our best.
It's in the hands of the voters now.

05:39.644 --> 05:40.675
Hey, Debbie.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.264
Are you okay, Pandora?
You look a little down.

05:43.389 --> 05:46.500
There's something in the computer lab
you need to see.

05:48.698 --> 05:51.767
"Not only is Debbie Hyman
not fit to be president,

05:51.892 --> 05:53.437
she isn't fit enough

05:53.580 --> 05:55.256
to wear people clothes."

05:57.204 --> 05:58.807
"Debbie is a big slut

05:58.932 --> 06:02.277
who makes fun of the freaks
she claims to represent."

06:05.335 --> 06:07.156
Shut up!
Shut up I say!

06:07.326 --> 06:08.694
Who did this?!

06:11.048 --> 06:14.038
Lisa Silver!
The popular girls, I knew it!

06:14.245 --> 06:16.734
Turn off these computers!
No, not good enough!

06:16.859 --> 06:18.479
Destroy the Internet!

06:20.727 --> 06:22.387
What is this, mahogany?

06:25.306 --> 06:28.122
<i>Thank you all for electing me
to another term.</i>

06:28.389 --> 06:30.046
<i>My first order of business:</i>

06:30.171 --> 06:34.034
<i>doubling the number of pep rallies
for our awesome sports teams!</i>

06:36.331 --> 06:38.120
She lied and cheated to win!

06:38.245 --> 06:40.342
- Aren't you pissed off?
- Sure, but

06:40.467 --> 06:43.433
that doesn't mean I need
to stoop to their level.

06:44.376 --> 06:47.877
I'm gonna go eat that chocolate
crucifix I've been saving.

06:50.634 --> 06:52.368
Guess you guys heard Debbie lost.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.662
Now Steve can play with us again!

06:55.193 --> 06:58.041
Hey, the man's lady
was just publicly humiliated.

06:58.338 --> 07:00.376
- You okay?
- I will be, Snot.

07:00.546 --> 07:02.374
Debbie may not want
to stoop to their level,

07:02.499 --> 07:04.292
but I've been stooping
my whole life.

07:04.417 --> 07:05.980
I'm gonna destroy Lisa Silver

07:06.105 --> 07:09.065
and those bitches that helped
her post that slam page!

07:12.183 --> 07:13.316
Oh, no, no,

07:13.441 --> 07:15.104
This is my promotional lunchbox

07:15.229 --> 07:16.938
from that Cartoon Network show

07:17.063 --> 07:20.321
about the bundle of dynamite
who lives with a talking burrito.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.316
Still, my revenge will be harsh.

07:26.022 --> 07:28.214
Steve, you can't be
seriously be thinking

07:28.339 --> 07:30.781
of going after Lisa Silver
and her minions.

07:30.906 --> 07:32.542
Don't try to talk me out of this.

07:32.667 --> 07:35.054
None of you can understand
defending the honor of a woman

07:35.179 --> 07:36.579
none of you have girlfriends.

07:39.877 --> 07:42.460
Yes, Toshi, there is
a way you can help me.

07:56.975 --> 07:58.301
So it begins.

08:00.066 --> 08:03.731
Perfect. This just enough cash
to bankroll my revenge schemes.

08:18.463 --> 08:20.399
Daddy, it's perfect!

08:20.562 --> 08:22.562
After that negative pregnancy test,

08:22.690 --> 08:24.179
you've earned it.

08:43.416 --> 08:45.104
Oops, that's the clutch.

08:54.010 --> 08:56.063
You think Debbie's a buffalo?

08:56.188 --> 08:58.094
I'll show you a buffalo.

09:18.643 --> 09:20.972
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice, Doc.

09:21.097 --> 09:23.131
Last week,
I accidentally ate a cookie.

09:23.256 --> 09:26.327
Well, any excuse to put you under
and chew on your feet.

09:26.452 --> 09:27.838
You're funny.

09:28.325 --> 09:30.080
Yes, I'm funny.

09:30.460 --> 09:33.404
All right, I'm just gonna give you
a little anesthesia.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.864
Doctor, Frankie Muniz
is on line one.

09:35.989 --> 09:38.958
- He says he needs a new face.
- I got to take this!

09:39.083 --> 09:40.459
I'll be right back.

09:44.435 --> 09:45.833
Hello, Janet.

09:51.035 --> 09:54.106
You think Debbie's fat?
I'll show you fat.

09:55.586 --> 09:58.644
I'm suing, you hear me?!
Suing!

10:21.648 --> 10:24.537
It's very simple, madam.
I'd like you to turn a trick--

10:24.662 --> 10:26.689
to use the parlance
of your profession--

10:26.814 --> 10:28.721
with my stuffed friend here.

10:32.367 --> 10:33.257
Whoa, whoa!

10:33.382 --> 10:35.070
Just 'cause you do that in the woods

10:35.195 --> 10:37.718
doesn't mean you can
do that on my chest.

10:44.395 --> 10:47.395
You think Debbie's a slut?
I'll show you a slut.

10:55.079 --> 10:57.405
- Slut.
- Slut! Slut!

10:57.575 --> 11:00.449
Slut! Slut! Slut! Slut!

11:07.101 --> 11:08.398
Got my revenge.

11:08.579 --> 11:09.892
That's great, honey.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.392
It was nice of Steve
to acknowledge us this week,

11:12.517 --> 11:14.391
even if it was only this once.

11:22.972 --> 11:24.359
You're in a good mood.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.354
And I bet I can guess why.

11:26.487 --> 11:30.423
I know! My insurance agreed to cover
my degenerative joint medicine!

11:30.548 --> 11:32.499
I meant you must think
it's pretty cool

11:32.624 --> 11:34.769
what happened to Lisa Silver
and her friends?

11:35.448 --> 11:37.374
Sure.
That's karma for you.

11:37.499 --> 11:39.093
No, that's not karma.

11:39.218 --> 11:40.745
That me-- your boyfriend.

11:40.870 --> 11:43.242
I got revenge on them
and defended your honor.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.297
That was... you?

11:45.804 --> 11:48.935
Steve, after all I said about
not stooping to their level,

11:49.060 --> 11:51.083
how could you possibly
think I'd want that?

11:51.285 --> 11:54.582
Because a woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

11:54.954 --> 11:56.995
James Cameron, 1997, Titanic.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.905
You know what?
You're no better than them.

12:00.210 --> 12:01.364
We're through.

12:01.650 --> 12:04.018
Wait. This can't possibly end badly.

12:04.143 --> 12:06.141
You're my first girlfriend.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.278
It'll be okay, buddy.

12:08.403 --> 12:10.400
You know what?
You're better off without her.

12:10.525 --> 12:13.618
She's not fit enough
to recalibrate your tricorder.

12:13.847 --> 12:16.400
Or fit enough
to wear people clothes.

12:19.047 --> 12:21.447
That's the same lame joke
from the Web page.

12:21.718 --> 12:24.200
I mean... I'm Barry.

12:25.122 --> 12:27.004
Hey, which would win in a battle,

12:27.129 --> 12:31.476
the Death Star or Carl Sagan's
Spaceship of the Imagination?

12:31.878 --> 12:34.502
Did you guys have something
to do with that slam page?

12:37.132 --> 12:39.198
- So you admit it.
- I'm Barry!

12:39.323 --> 12:41.264
Fine, you got us.

12:41.546 --> 12:43.919
Look, we never thought
it would go this far.

12:44.044 --> 12:46.132
We just wanted you
back with our crew.

12:46.257 --> 12:49.186
And if Debbie was president,
you'd be so busy being First Lady

12:49.311 --> 12:52.395
- we'd never see you again.
- Do you have any idea what you've done?

12:52.565 --> 12:55.021
Because of you,
I destroyed three innocent girls,

12:55.146 --> 12:58.692
lost Debbie and jammed laxatives
arm-deep into a buffalo!

12:58.950 --> 13:01.649
- Our friendship is over!
- You should thank us.

13:01.774 --> 13:04.448
We saved you
from suffocating under her.

13:04.691 --> 13:06.408
Is that a fat joke?!

13:07.127 --> 13:09.054
Yeah. Yeah.

13:09.388 --> 13:12.045
- I guess it is.
- I'll kill you!

13:17.218 --> 13:19.899
You did this to us, Steve Smith.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.007
What? No.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.361
Justin's uncle owns the mask store.

13:24.486 --> 13:26.562
According to his receipts,
only one person

13:26.687 --> 13:29.515
bought a Hopi Indian revenge
mask in the last 50 years.

13:29.866 --> 13:32.489
I... I...
It was all their fault!

13:32.614 --> 13:34.431
They put up the slam page
and framed you.

13:34.556 --> 13:37.106
I never would have done those things
if it weren't for them.{\I swear.}

13:37.378 --> 13:39.023
Then we'll just beat you all up.

13:39.148 --> 13:43.291
I'm going to kick the fat one's head in.
I'm going to break the fat one's spine.

13:43.449 --> 13:45.227
I'm popular.

13:50.813 --> 13:53.636
Look, ladies, I-I realize
you must be angry,

13:53.761 --> 13:57.198
but you can't just beat us to death
on school property.

13:57.996 --> 14:00.629
Principal Lewis.
Thank God, we're saved.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.866
Sorry, Smith.
I've ordered my administration

14:02.991 --> 14:04.772
to turn a blind eye
to these proceedings.

14:04.897 --> 14:07.333
{\pos(192,230)}- Thanks, Daddy.
- Janet's your daughter?

14:07.458 --> 14:09.346
{\pos(192,230)}How come you never
mentioned this before?

14:09.676 --> 14:11.047
{\pos(192,230)}Because I'm ashamed of her

14:11.172 --> 14:13.524
{\pos(192,230)}for more reasons
than you can imagine.

14:14.084 --> 14:16.752
Still, that's my little girl, man.
Attack!

14:18.943 --> 14:20.847
Escape plan ten-delta.

14:25.636 --> 14:28.154
- Damn it!
- Easy, girl.

14:28.412 --> 14:30.863
They belong to the bleachers now.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.839
Steve, help Barry.

15:10.473 --> 15:13.169
You were going to let
Barry get chopped up back there.

15:13.294 --> 15:15.204
And I'd do the same to any of you.

15:15.416 --> 15:18.541
Look, Steve, we don't like you
and you don't like us.

15:18.724 --> 15:22.089
But if we want to survive this,
we need to work together.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.380
Fine.
But after that, we're through.

15:25.637 --> 15:27.146
Okay, we're here.

15:27.425 --> 15:30.724
At 3:15, my mom will be waiting
for me in her SUV here.

15:30.849 --> 15:32.596
If we can get to her, we'll live.

15:32.721 --> 15:35.410
Also she'll have snacks.
Healthy snacks, but snacks.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.189
But look at all these turfs
we need to pass through:

15:38.314 --> 15:40.245
the art club, the future farmers,

15:40.370 --> 15:41.709
the young auctioneers.

15:41.834 --> 15:44.546
None of those gangs are affiliated
with the jocks or the cheerleaders.

15:44.671 --> 15:46.669
They have no reason to bother us.

15:46.908 --> 15:48.779
<i>Hey, there, big boys and girls,</i>

15:49.036 --> 15:51.865
four dangerous nerds
are trying to escape

15:51.990 --> 15:53.868
school-sanctioned mob justice.

15:54.038 --> 15:57.079
<i>Whoever catches them gets the $500</i>

15:57.249 --> 16:00.814
I keep sticking out of my pocket
to make you kids think I'm rich.

16:01.470 --> 16:02.459
We're dead.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.214
We need to get
to that door, but how?

16:20.339 --> 16:22.260
The stage is lousy with drama geeks.

16:22.385 --> 16:23.968
Actors killed Lincoln.

16:24.093 --> 16:25.240
I don't know, Steve.

16:25.365 --> 16:27.631
That's a long cross,
and we don't have any dialogue.

16:27.756 --> 16:29.278
We don't need any dialogue.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.655
All we need is
some physical business.

16:37.190 --> 16:39.788
Hey, somebody's stealing focus.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.291
It's those nerds.
Seize them.

16:56.958 --> 16:59.247
Wait, remember your Galactica.

16:59.438 --> 17:02.325
The best way to destroy
a Cylon fleet...

17:02.450 --> 17:04.646
Is by taking out it's Basestar.

17:05.347 --> 17:06.363
Hey, Evan,

17:06.488 --> 17:08.588
I found your portrayal
of Conrad Birdie

17:08.713 --> 17:10.758
to be entirely too contrived.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.698
- You did?
- Your method is flawed.

17:19.218 --> 17:20.742
What does he know?

17:20.867 --> 17:22.561
You totally found every moment.

17:22.686 --> 17:25.166
I never wanted to say
bye-bye to your Birdie.

17:28.674 --> 17:29.615
<i>Word is,</i>

17:29.740 --> 17:33.008
<i>those nerds managed to put the slip
on the drama geeks.</i>

17:33.282 --> 17:36.637
Guess it's up to the stoners
to take them down now.

17:37.571 --> 17:39.755
Lunch tomorrow will
be fish sticks...

17:39.885 --> 17:41.634
and tartar sauce.

17:49.122 --> 17:52.460
Stop right there, dudes.
You're not getting past.

17:53.130 --> 17:56.134
Hey, if people can get past,

17:56.470 --> 17:59.656
can they also get future?

18:03.667 --> 18:04.540
Run!

18:07.006 --> 18:08.363
Nice gambit, Barry.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.319
Where did you learn
how to confuse stoners?

18:10.444 --> 18:12.297
My mom does bongs.

18:15.610 --> 18:16.684
Where are we?

18:16.809 --> 18:18.721
Smells like a Depeche Mode concert.

18:19.205 --> 18:21.717
No!
We're in goth territory.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.377
Yeah, well, no one's here.
Let's keep moving.

18:27.534 --> 18:29.896
- That reward money's ours.
- But first,

18:30.021 --> 18:33.881
the ritual of the rusty dagger
I bought from a vampire on eBay.

18:35.808 --> 18:38.741
Stop!
Let the nerdy one go.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.437
The scrawny nerdy one.

18:45.051 --> 18:47.372
The scrawny nerdy one with glasses.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.390
You're rescuing me?

18:52.515 --> 18:54.284
I thought you never
wanted to see me again.

18:54.409 --> 18:57.161
That was before those cheerleaders
started hunting you.

18:57.286 --> 18:59.765
It was easy for me to say,
"Don't stoop to their level"

18:59.890 --> 19:01.337
when they were picking on me,

19:01.462 --> 19:03.741
but when it's someone
you care about, well...

19:03.866 --> 19:06.310
I understand now why you went
all nutter butters.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.422
Debbie, baby bear is coming home.

19:12.038 --> 19:13.694
They're in the stairwell!

19:13.819 --> 19:15.524
Let's get you out of here.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.533
Not so fast.

19:17.895 --> 19:20.657
We're still getting that reward money
for the rest of you.

19:25.499 --> 19:26.830
Steve, come on.

19:27.093 --> 19:30.021
I'm sorry, Debbie, but if running
for my life with these guys

19:30.146 --> 19:33.009
has taught me anything,
it's that they're my friends.

19:33.134 --> 19:35.984
And I need to find room in my life
for you and them.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.612
So, if you're gonna
turn them over to that mob,

19:38.737 --> 19:40.469
you can turn me over with them.

19:45.203 --> 19:47.097
- Let them all go.
- But Debbie,

19:47.222 --> 19:49.955
we were gonna use the reward money
to buy a real cat skeleton.

19:50.080 --> 19:50.951
Give it up.

19:51.076 --> 19:53.839
We all know that you went
to tennis camp last summer.

19:54.468 --> 19:56.294
Go. I'll hold them off.

20:02.406 --> 20:04.771
You shall not pass!

20:17.549 --> 20:19.842
That's my mom's SUV.
We made it!

20:23.972 --> 20:26.380
And all because we worked together.

20:26.505 --> 20:29.476
As long as we stay friends,
there's nothing we can't...

20:31.982 --> 20:35.232
Crap, we should have been running
instead of wrapping up.

20:42.914 --> 20:45.423
Well, guys, we won't survive this,

20:45.693 --> 20:48.275
but we might as well go out
in a blaze of glory.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.367
Together as friends.

20:50.492 --> 20:52.829
- Best friends.
- Best friends.

20:55.711 --> 20:57.236
Okay, let's do this.

20:57.361 --> 20:58.381
If we're lucky,

20:58.506 --> 21:00.674
we might just take
a few of them with us!

21:07.579 --> 21:09.916
We're not taking
any of them with us!
