00:07.204 --> 00:08.370
Hello.

00:08.372 --> 00:11.206
Hi.

00:11.208 --> 00:13.242
My name is Jimmy Sanguinetti.

00:13.244 --> 00:14.610
I'm here to see Erin Lindsay.

00:14.612 --> 00:18.447
Regarding?

00:18.449 --> 00:21.817
I'm her father.

00:21.819 --> 00:24.219
Does she know this?

00:24.221 --> 00:25.621
She does.

00:26.824 --> 00:28.357
So, if I were to call up there and say,

00:28.359 --> 00:29.992
"hey, your dad's down here,"

00:29.994 --> 00:31.193
this wouldn't be some kind of joke?

00:31.195 --> 00:32.795
Look, if you could just...

00:32.797 --> 00:35.564
Let her know I'm here, that'd be great.

00:35.566 --> 00:38.534
Thanks.

00:41.305 --> 00:44.706
Someone here to see you, Detective.

00:44.708 --> 00:46.508
Hey.

00:46.510 --> 00:49.311
Thanks.

00:49.313 --> 00:50.579
So, yeah, here's the...

00:52.383 --> 00:56.385
Photo album I was telling you about.

00:56.387 --> 00:58.387
Hey, man. You want a coffee?

00:58.389 --> 01:00.422
Thanks.

01:00.424 --> 01:04.025
Your mom was always really
good about sending them.

01:04.028 --> 01:06.628
Wow.

01:06.630 --> 01:09.698
Aww, that's, super cute.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.340
Hank. This is...

01:18.342 --> 01:21.977
Jimmy Sanguinetti.

01:21.979 --> 01:23.545
- How are you?
- Hey.

01:23.547 --> 01:25.180
Looking good, Hank.

01:25.182 --> 01:26.481
Still at your fighting weight.

01:26.483 --> 01:30.853
Yeah.

01:30.855 --> 01:33.488
I just want to say...

01:33.490 --> 01:36.058
You did a real good job raising her.

01:36.060 --> 01:38.493
Happy to help.

01:38.495 --> 01:41.463
We caught a case.

01:41.465 --> 01:43.699
That... That means we gotta roll.

01:46.136 --> 01:47.703
No, no. That's...

01:47.705 --> 01:49.338
That's for you.

01:49.340 --> 01:55.143
I kind of like that you
kept them all these years.

01:55.145 --> 01:57.713
- I'll text you.
- Okay.

01:57.715 --> 01:59.915
- Take it easy.
- You too.

02:05.155 --> 02:08.323
This is me running it for DNA, not you.

02:08.324 --> 02:10.359
Jay.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.361
Erin...

02:12.363 --> 02:14.963
We gotta know if this guy
is who your mom says he is.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.322 --> 02:40.489
- Hank.
- What do we got?

02:40.491 --> 02:42.891
Victim's a white male, mid 30s.

02:42.893 --> 02:44.893
Streets and San worker
came across the body

02:44.895 --> 02:45.961
on his morning rounds.

02:45.963 --> 02:47.963
Called it in just before eight.

02:47.965 --> 02:50.332
We got uniforms canvassing
the area right now.

02:50.334 --> 02:51.867
Who's the lead for forensics?

02:51.869 --> 02:53.969
Emilio. I already gave him
our Bell and Pax number.

02:53.971 --> 02:56.171
Crime scene photos will be
hand delivered in an hour.

02:56.173 --> 02:59.041
And I put a request into missing
in case someone makes a call.

02:59.043 --> 03:00.642
That's good.

03:01.912 --> 03:05.113
Why is it a potential hate crime?

03:05.115 --> 03:07.516
Because of this.

03:09.253 --> 03:11.420
What's with the gauze and plastic wrap?

03:11.422 --> 03:14.423
His penis was severed.

03:24.752 --> 03:26.653
We've printed the DOA
at the ME's office.

03:26.655 --> 03:27.754
The name's Sandford Greg.

03:27.756 --> 03:28.856
Registered sex offender.

03:28.858 --> 03:29.990
Five arrests for possession.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.258
Three drunk and disorderly.

03:31.260 --> 03:33.093
Two counts strong arm robbery.

03:33.095 --> 03:35.095
And, four different
restraining orders.

03:35.097 --> 03:36.463
Including one from his mother.

03:36.465 --> 03:39.299
In and out of prison since he was 16.

03:39.301 --> 03:41.435
According to the ME,
estimated time of death

03:41.437 --> 03:43.470
was midnight. Initial tox screens

03:43.472 --> 03:45.439
showed a cocktail of different
narcotics in his blood.

03:45.441 --> 03:47.474
Okay, so, this guy either OD'd

03:47.476 --> 03:50.477
or bled out from the
severed... you know.

03:50.479 --> 03:52.646
Well, given his rap sheet,
I'm sure there's no shortage

03:52.648 --> 03:54.648
of people who'd want to do this to him.

03:54.650 --> 03:56.049
And we find out who,

03:56.051 --> 03:58.886
and whether or not it's
a hate crime, sex assault,

03:58.888 --> 04:00.220
or self mutilation.

04:00.222 --> 04:03.290
Erin and I started
canvassing all the pharmacies

04:03.292 --> 04:04.892
and the urgent care in the area.

04:04.894 --> 04:07.461
No walk-ins, no drive-ins,
no ambulance runs.

04:07.463 --> 04:09.663
But we checked every place that sells

04:09.665 --> 04:10.931
gauze and plastic wrap,

04:10.933 --> 04:13.100
and we found a retail theft report.

04:13.102 --> 04:15.135
Basically says a man
covered in blood stole

04:15.137 --> 04:17.237
bandages and medicine
from a corner store.

04:17.238 --> 04:21.440
Good. You and Burgess.

04:21.442 --> 04:23.410
Hey, um, crime scene
photo's on the DOA came.

04:23.412 --> 04:26.180
No, thanks.

04:29.418 --> 04:32.786
So, you remember Jimmy?

04:32.788 --> 04:36.256
Yeah, yeah, it's good
to see him, you know...

04:38.360 --> 04:40.260
What was he like back then?

04:40.262 --> 04:41.695
Erin, that was 30 years ago.

04:41.697 --> 04:45.933
I'm a different person, too.

04:45.935 --> 04:48.302
Right.

04:48.304 --> 04:49.870
You just haven't said anything

04:49.872 --> 04:52.339
since I told you he might
be back in the picture.

04:52.341 --> 04:53.941
Listen...

04:53.943 --> 04:55.509
I want what you want.

04:55.511 --> 04:56.944
If this is filling a void for you,

04:56.946 --> 04:58.946
that's all that matters.

04:58.948 --> 05:00.747
And...

05:00.749 --> 05:01.782
Having lost Justin,

05:01.784 --> 05:04.451
I appreciate the value of family.

05:08.424 --> 05:09.423
I called it in, but by the time

05:09.425 --> 05:10.757
the cops and paramedics got here...

05:10.759 --> 05:12.326
It was history.

05:12.328 --> 05:15.162
No offense, but your
guys' response time sucks.

05:15.164 --> 05:16.330
Thanks for the support, Sir.

05:16.332 --> 05:17.798
Can you, pull the footage?

05:17.800 --> 05:19.399
Manager's a cheap ass.

05:19.401 --> 05:21.468
Those things, they are for show.

05:21.470 --> 05:22.669
Ooh, check this out, though.

05:22.671 --> 05:23.937
Yeah, it had to be shot.

05:23.939 --> 05:25.072
You have no idea the kind of whack jobs

05:25.074 --> 05:26.640
that come into this joint.

05:26.642 --> 05:29.476
Here.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.853
He had to have been on something, right?

05:39.855 --> 05:41.288
Yeah, that would be my guess.

05:41.290 --> 05:42.789
I'll have Atwater call OEMC.

05:42.791 --> 05:44.524
See if anybody nearby called 911.

05:44.526 --> 05:46.026
All right, here, here, let me have that.

05:46.028 --> 05:49.463
Come on.

05:49.465 --> 05:51.632
Call came in at 9:51 pm.

05:51.634 --> 05:52.866
Report of a suspicious person,

05:52.868 --> 05:55.502
suspected sexual assault
near Pulaski Park.

05:55.504 --> 05:57.504
Dispatch put it over the
zone one minute later,

05:57.506 --> 05:58.939
two cars rode on the job.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.941
It was coded out as 11 Adam,

06:00.943 --> 06:02.109
not a bona fide incident.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.243
Okay. You think you can pull up

06:03.245 --> 06:04.311
the recording for us?

06:04.313 --> 06:06.046
Along with all service calls of the Park

06:06.048 --> 06:07.247
for the last couple of months,

06:07.249 --> 06:08.915
anything that can be related.

06:08.917 --> 06:11.251
Gotta get the watch
commander's approval on that.

06:11.253 --> 06:12.819
Come back in a couple of hours?

06:12.821 --> 06:16.423
Who knows, Saturday I'm
doing special security detail

06:16.425 --> 06:18.992
at the double door for
a band called Duran.

06:18.994 --> 06:20.294
Are you familiar?

06:20.296 --> 06:22.596
You... Do you mean, Duran Duran?

06:22.598 --> 06:24.231
It's two Duran?

06:24.233 --> 06:26.066
Thought that was a misprint.

06:26.068 --> 06:27.634
No, it's Duran Duran.

06:27.636 --> 06:30.237
Great, good. I figured
you might like them.

06:30.239 --> 06:32.906
Not just because you're a
white woman of a certain age.

06:32.908 --> 06:34.074
But I can get you backstage.

06:34.076 --> 06:36.510
You'd have a great time.

06:36.512 --> 06:37.944
Who do I ask for?

06:37.946 --> 06:39.246
I think if you ask for
the big, good looking,

06:39.248 --> 06:41.415
black dude, you'll be okay.

06:46.422 --> 06:48.922
Caller's name was George Higgins.

06:48.924 --> 06:51.925
Lives at 1856 South Grand.

06:51.927 --> 06:53.327
Copy that.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.628
See you Saturday.

06:54.630 --> 06:56.363
Tell us what you saw, Mr. Higgins.

06:56.365 --> 06:57.764
And the more detail, the better.

06:57.766 --> 06:59.766
I went out to the Lincoln
to get my cigs, right?

06:59.768 --> 07:01.368
My old lady don't
like me smoking inside.

07:01.370 --> 07:02.869
That's when I heard this howling sound.

07:02.871 --> 07:04.071
Like an animal, or something.

07:04.073 --> 07:05.439
Scared the hell out of me.

07:05.441 --> 07:07.641
- Where was that?
- Right over at the Park.

07:07.643 --> 07:11.445
Now, the 911 call said you
suspected a sexual assault.

07:11.447 --> 07:12.946
Why'd you think that?

07:12.948 --> 07:14.247
I've seen this girl
running off the other way.

07:14.249 --> 07:16.249
Somebody screaming, somebody running.

07:16.251 --> 07:18.719
One male, the other female, you know.

07:18.721 --> 07:19.953
Did you get a good look at the female?

07:19.955 --> 07:23.623
Nah, it was dark,
and she was hauling ass.

07:23.625 --> 07:25.425
Kind of golf type chick, maybe.

07:25.427 --> 07:26.827
Looked like she might
have tossed something

07:26.829 --> 07:28.261
in them bushes, there.

07:28.263 --> 07:30.263
Did you go and check out what she threw?

07:30.265 --> 07:32.666
No, man, did one better. Called 911.

07:32.668 --> 07:34.668
The rest is your job, bro.

07:34.670 --> 07:36.103
People walk their dogs over there.

07:37.306 --> 07:39.339
- Okay.
- Right.

07:43.445 --> 07:44.411
Right around...

07:44.413 --> 07:45.812
There.

07:45.814 --> 07:48.982
All right. Just take
a step back, please.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.291
Knife. Blood on the blade.

07:58.293 --> 08:00.260
Yeah, told you. Didn't I tell y'all?

08:00.262 --> 08:01.895
Ain't there some kind
of reward for that?

08:01.897 --> 08:03.163
Helping y'all do your jobs?

08:03.165 --> 08:05.098
A firm handshake and
a sincere thank you,

08:05.100 --> 08:06.400
that's your reward.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.901
All right. We should
get the crime scene techs

08:07.903 --> 08:09.269
out here to photograph that. Yeah.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.437
Which way did the girl run then?

08:10.439 --> 08:12.739
Down 41st toward
the boys and girls club.

08:12.741 --> 08:14.975
Okay.

08:14.977 --> 08:18.412
All right.

08:22.618 --> 08:25.252
Can you back that up a couple frames?

08:26.622 --> 08:29.122
And also, do you know the
IP address of that camera?

08:29.124 --> 08:31.324
'Cause we're going to need
it for the evidentiary record.

08:31.326 --> 08:32.726
I can get it.

08:32.727 --> 08:33.827
I'm going to circulate this

08:33.828 --> 08:35.269
to all of the patrolmen in the area.

08:36.331 --> 08:38.063
Thank you.

08:38.066 --> 08:40.433
Emily Vega. Minor record.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.235
A couple of pinches for possession.

08:42.236 --> 08:43.503
We quit locking her up.

08:43.505 --> 08:45.238
She's too much of a pain in the ass.

08:45.240 --> 08:48.275
So, she comes here to hook up, get high,

08:48.277 --> 08:49.843
and hang with the other dirt-bags.

08:49.845 --> 08:51.278
All right. This goes where, now?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.946
They call this the canals.

08:52.948 --> 08:56.850
Home away from home for
scumbags, meth-heads,

08:56.852 --> 08:58.452
and every other jag-off
looking to score.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.253
I think she's down there.

09:00.255 --> 09:02.923
Yeah, that's her.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.394
Emily.

09:07.396 --> 09:09.329
Hey!

09:11.433 --> 09:14.634
Stop! Chicago PD!

09:19.641 --> 09:21.374
No, you don't.

09:21.376 --> 09:22.409
Let go of me.

09:22.411 --> 09:24.311
- Emily Vega?
- I didn't do anything.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.379
Then why are you running?

09:26.381 --> 09:27.381
Why are you running?

09:33.288 --> 09:36.289
She's in the interview room.

09:36.291 --> 09:38.358
Ready?

09:41.330 --> 09:43.630
Hey, why don't you let the kid take it?

09:45.734 --> 09:49.903
All right. Come on.

09:57.012 --> 09:59.446
You know him?

09:59.448 --> 10:01.414
No.

10:06.255 --> 10:09.256
We found your fingerprints
on that knife, Emily.

10:09.258 --> 10:10.824
Okay.

10:10.826 --> 10:15.262
And that blood there
belongs to that man.

10:15.264 --> 10:16.830
How did that happen?

10:16.832 --> 10:18.632
I lost that knife a few days ago.

10:18.634 --> 10:21.468
Who knows what happened
to it since then?

10:21.470 --> 10:23.203
Ask him.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.437
Yeah, well, thing is,

10:24.439 --> 10:26.640
he's not in a very talkative mood.

10:26.642 --> 10:29.643
We found him laying beside a dumpster,

10:29.645 --> 10:32.045
missing part of his
body that I'm assuming

10:32.047 --> 10:36.249
was kind of important to him.

10:40.956 --> 10:43.423
What happened, Emily?

10:45.527 --> 10:49.329
He tried to rape me.

10:49.331 --> 10:51.531
When?

10:51.533 --> 10:54.167
Last night.

10:54.169 --> 10:57.337
I went to Pulaski
Park with some friends.

10:57.339 --> 10:59.339
We were partying a little.

10:59.341 --> 11:01.341
Later on I realized I dropped a 20.

11:01.343 --> 11:03.777
I went back looking for it, and...

11:03.779 --> 11:06.179
This guy came out of the bushes.

11:06.181 --> 11:08.782
He attacked me.

11:08.784 --> 11:11.184
He had his forearm on my throat,

11:11.186 --> 11:13.420
and he was pushing my pants down,

11:13.422 --> 11:15.088
and when he pulled it out,

11:15.090 --> 11:19.292
that gave me a little window
to reach into my back pocket

11:19.294 --> 11:22.262
and get out my knife.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.097
I sliced...

11:24.099 --> 11:26.333
He yelled, I ran.

11:31.540 --> 11:36.343
Had you had any dealings
with him prior to last night?

11:36.345 --> 11:37.978
No. Why?

11:37.980 --> 11:39.546
What's he saying?

11:39.548 --> 11:42.549
Well, he's not saying much.

11:42.551 --> 11:45.051
He's dead.

11:47.689 --> 11:49.489
Well...

11:49.491 --> 11:53.693
What goes around, comes around.

11:55.530 --> 11:58.164
Okay. So...

11:58.166 --> 12:00.166
What happened after you sliced him?

12:00.168 --> 12:03.770
I ran. I met back up with my friends.

12:03.772 --> 12:07.240
You see, his body was found
at a different location, Emily.

12:07.242 --> 12:08.375
I can't help you there.

12:08.377 --> 12:11.444
So, we have detectives
headed to the morgue right now

12:11.446 --> 12:13.913
to see what the medical
examiner has to say...

12:13.915 --> 12:15.915
look, he attacked me in Pulaski Park.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.117
I fought for my life, then ran.

12:17.119 --> 12:18.251
I never saw him again.

12:18.253 --> 12:21.121
If it was self defense...

12:21.123 --> 12:22.822
Why didn't you call the cops, report it?

12:22.824 --> 12:24.958
Because every time I've
ever gone to you guys,

12:24.960 --> 12:26.526
you never do anything.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.162
Never! Like, right now.

12:29.164 --> 12:31.965
How about a "hey, I'm sorry
you were almost raped"?

12:31.967 --> 12:35.168
Or "thank God you were
able to fight him off."

12:35.170 --> 12:36.770
No, I get two cops looking at me

12:36.772 --> 12:38.772
like I killed him in
some other location.

12:38.774 --> 12:41.908
Screw you guys.

12:49.618 --> 12:52.385
I am sorry you were almost raped.

12:59.828 --> 13:02.629
Understand your boy covered
a lot of ground last night.

13:02.631 --> 13:04.230
Yeah.

13:04.232 --> 13:06.266
How's that possible? You'd
think an injury like that

13:06.268 --> 13:07.567
would be a night-ender.

13:07.569 --> 13:10.270
There's only one principle
artery in the penis.

13:10.272 --> 13:11.638
An incidence like this,

13:11.640 --> 13:14.140
there's a 60% chance it retracts.

13:14.142 --> 13:17.510
Clamps itself off to
prevent a hemodynamic event.

13:17.512 --> 13:20.747
Re... retracts? Like...

13:23.151 --> 13:25.752
So, if he didn't bleed out...

13:25.754 --> 13:28.154
You're saying it was an OD?

13:28.156 --> 13:30.957
No.

13:30.959 --> 13:32.325
How...

13:32.327 --> 13:36.162
How low do you think
you have to go with that?

13:36.164 --> 13:39.532
Say when.

13:39.534 --> 13:42.769
When.

13:42.771 --> 13:44.304
You see the broken blood vessels

13:44.306 --> 13:46.272
around the peri-orbital area?

13:46.274 --> 13:47.540
Those little purple
dots around his eyes?

13:47.542 --> 13:49.342
They're called petechiae.

13:49.344 --> 13:51.478
They're indicators that
the actual cause of death

13:51.480 --> 13:53.179
was strangulation.

13:53.181 --> 13:55.682
Didn't notice them at first,
but once we got him cleaned up,

13:55.684 --> 13:58.485
I saw the engorgement on his trachea.

13:58.487 --> 14:00.487
See the blue-ish discoloration?

14:00.489 --> 14:01.888
Yeah.

14:01.890 --> 14:03.957
This guy was choked to death.

14:12.934 --> 14:14.934
What's up?

14:14.936 --> 14:17.504
I had my guy at the lab
fast track Jimmy's DNA.

14:19.941 --> 14:22.041
Erin, he's not your dad.

14:27.749 --> 14:30.750
I'm so sorry.

14:34.589 --> 14:36.356
Are you happy?

14:42.317 --> 14:44.018
Emily Vega is claiming she was attacked

14:44.020 --> 14:46.287
around 9:45 pm at Pulaski Park.

14:46.289 --> 14:47.888
After she cut Sandford Greg,

14:47.890 --> 14:49.390
he wandered over to the corner store,

14:49.392 --> 14:50.791
arrived at 9:57,

14:50.793 --> 14:52.426
left again two minutes later.

14:52.428 --> 14:53.694
The... The meta-data

14:53.696 --> 14:55.796
from the clerk's cell phone
corroborates the time-line.

14:55.798 --> 14:58.232
Blood work from both locations
confirms his movements.

14:58.234 --> 14:59.400
Okay, so, according to the me,

14:59.402 --> 15:00.401
the time of death is around midnight.

15:00.403 --> 15:01.402
But...

15:01.404 --> 15:03.237
At around 7:45 am,

15:03.239 --> 15:04.672
the body is discovered here.

15:04.674 --> 15:07.675
That's eight miles from
where the incident took place.

15:07.677 --> 15:09.477
So, if Emily didn't
do it, who killed him,

15:09.479 --> 15:10.878
dumped his body, and why?

15:10.880 --> 15:12.513
Why are we ruling out Emily?

15:12.515 --> 15:15.883
She's 105 pounds, soaking
wet, and this guy's 6'2", 220.

15:15.885 --> 15:18.085
I don't buy that she choked him.

15:18.087 --> 15:22.122
Sure, but she could have
had a friend finish him off.

15:22.124 --> 15:25.493
People lie through their
teeth all the time, don't they?

15:25.495 --> 15:29.096
She's not ruled out. We're
looking at everything.

15:29.098 --> 15:30.364
Let's take another run at her.

15:30.366 --> 15:32.933
Got it.

15:33.870 --> 15:35.536
Um...

15:35.538 --> 15:37.371
Lindsay and Halstead are dating, right?

15:37.373 --> 15:38.539
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:38.541 --> 15:41.809
That explains everything.

15:44.780 --> 15:47.781
Hey.

15:50.586 --> 15:54.788
Here you go.

15:57.059 --> 16:01.495
Anything else you want to tell
me about last night, Emily?

16:01.497 --> 16:03.664
No.

16:03.666 --> 16:05.366
Did you go back to Sandford Greg

16:05.368 --> 16:06.734
after you cut him?

16:06.736 --> 16:08.168
You already asked me this question.

16:08.170 --> 16:09.537
But you lied about knowing him

16:09.539 --> 16:11.739
when we showed you his photo, so...

16:11.741 --> 16:15.175
I'm just... I'm gonna ask again.

16:15.177 --> 16:18.379
No, I didn't go back to him.

16:18.381 --> 16:19.346
Okay, what about your friends?

16:19.348 --> 16:20.981
You tell any of them what happened?

16:20.983 --> 16:22.750
I didn't tell anyone.

16:22.752 --> 16:25.352
I would have.

16:25.354 --> 16:27.755
I mean, some animal tries to rape me

16:27.757 --> 16:30.190
and I'm able to pull my
knife and cut his penis off,

16:30.192 --> 16:32.459
damn right I'd tell people.

16:38.100 --> 16:41.535
I can't tell if you're
trying to trap me or not.

16:41.537 --> 16:45.539
I'm not.

16:45.541 --> 16:48.108
Yeah, I told some friends.

16:48.110 --> 16:49.343
Who?

16:49.345 --> 16:50.744
No way.

16:50.746 --> 16:53.514
And have you bring them here
and spin them around like me?

16:53.516 --> 16:54.715
No way.

16:54.717 --> 16:57.551
You may need to.

16:57.553 --> 16:59.253
Or what?

17:02.959 --> 17:05.425
Don't you believe me?

17:06.963 --> 17:09.363
I do.

17:09.365 --> 17:11.397
Then why am I still in jail?

17:19.342 --> 17:20.307
You kept pushing for it

17:20.309 --> 17:21.909
even after I told you I wasn't ready.

17:21.911 --> 17:23.711
You know what, Erin, personally,

17:23.713 --> 17:25.913
I would want to know.

17:25.915 --> 17:28.348
So, the next time you want to
leave your head in the sand,

17:28.351 --> 17:29.350
just raise your hand, that's fine,

17:29.352 --> 17:31.719
I'll leave you there.

17:31.721 --> 17:33.854
Is there something I
need to be aware of?

17:36.359 --> 17:38.993
Yeah, I went back through
Sandford Greg's rap sheet.

17:38.995 --> 17:40.561
He got pinched nine months ago

17:40.563 --> 17:42.563
for trespassing and drunk and disorderly

17:42.565 --> 17:44.198
at an apartment complex
a couple of blocks

17:44.200 --> 17:45.399
from where he got sliced up.

17:45.401 --> 17:46.567
It's called the Linden Homes.

17:46.569 --> 17:48.002
Check it out.

17:48.004 --> 17:50.004
I need a personal to handle something.

17:53.042 --> 17:56.010
Me and Rixton will take it.

17:56.012 --> 17:59.213
Sounds good.

18:01.050 --> 18:02.850
Yeah, so, you married?

18:02.852 --> 18:04.852
You got a girlfriend or something?

18:04.854 --> 18:07.655
I got a girlfriend.

18:07.657 --> 18:09.657
We're talking about moving in together.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.393
- What?
- Nothing.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.395
You'll find out.

18:18.067 --> 18:19.500
Can I help you?

18:19.502 --> 18:21.468
Can we talk to you for a second?

18:21.470 --> 18:23.504
This your place?

18:23.506 --> 18:25.305
Yeah. Why, what's up?

18:25.307 --> 18:26.473
Do you remember filing a complaint

18:26.475 --> 18:27.675
about nine months ago

18:27.677 --> 18:29.343
against a man named Sandford Greg?

18:29.345 --> 18:30.511
Before my time, guy.

18:30.513 --> 18:31.679
I just moved in two months ago.

18:31.681 --> 18:32.913
What about the previous tenants?

18:32.915 --> 18:34.148
You know where they are? Nah, but...

18:34.150 --> 18:35.382
If I was you, I would talk to

18:35.384 --> 18:36.550
the "special" police.

18:36.552 --> 18:37.818
If something went down here,

18:37.820 --> 18:39.353
those cats would be up and in it.

18:39.355 --> 18:40.988
- Special police?
- Yeah.

18:40.990 --> 18:42.556
They'll lock you up
for smoking a cigarette.

18:42.558 --> 18:45.392
You'd get along great.

18:45.394 --> 18:47.528
All right, boys. I'm back in.

18:47.530 --> 18:48.530
Let's do the thing.

18:49.899 --> 18:51.899
It seems like the
more condos they build,

18:51.901 --> 18:53.333
the busier I get.

18:53.335 --> 18:54.735
You know what I mean?

18:54.737 --> 18:56.737
So, you're the superior officer, right?

18:56.739 --> 18:58.539
Sergeant Lowdell. How can I help you?

18:58.541 --> 19:00.374
I'm detective Halstead.
This is detective Rixton.

19:00.376 --> 19:02.009
We just gotta ask you
guys a few questions.

19:02.011 --> 19:05.012
Have you seen this man before?

19:05.014 --> 19:06.814
Yeah, we had a couple
of run-ins with him.

19:06.816 --> 19:08.282
Meaning?

19:08.284 --> 19:10.217
You know, guy showed
up a couple of times.

19:10.219 --> 19:11.385
Drunk, high, whatever.

19:11.387 --> 19:12.820
He was asked to leave the premises.

19:12.822 --> 19:14.021
What about last night?

19:14.023 --> 19:15.222
Did you see him last night?

19:15.224 --> 19:16.824
- No.
- The guy in apartment 101

19:16.826 --> 19:18.826
says you run a tight ship, sergeant.

19:18.828 --> 19:20.227
Well, I'd take that as a compliment.

19:20.229 --> 19:21.829
He didn't seem real thrilled about it.

19:21.831 --> 19:23.697
You guys know how it is.

19:23.699 --> 19:26.366
People always hating on the
police until they need us.

19:26.368 --> 19:28.402
And then it's "how
fast can you get here?"

19:28.404 --> 19:29.684
Just like on the streets, right?

19:30.740 --> 19:33.073
If you guys generated any
paper on Sandford Greg,

19:33.075 --> 19:35.075
any reports, we need hard copies.

19:35.077 --> 19:36.310
Well, you got a car?
There's a few of them.

19:36.312 --> 19:37.311
I'll see what I can pull.

19:37.313 --> 19:38.579
Yeah, you know what?

19:38.581 --> 19:39.713
It's an active murder investigation.

19:39.715 --> 19:41.148
So, we need it now.

19:41.150 --> 19:43.350
And we're gonna need
to interview all the...

19:43.352 --> 19:44.318
Whatever you call yourselves...

19:44.320 --> 19:49.523
"special" police officers involved.

19:49.525 --> 19:51.325
Yeah?

19:51.327 --> 19:55.095
Then get a subpoena.

19:59.034 --> 20:02.035
The special police are trained
and sanctioned by Chicago PD,

20:02.037 --> 20:04.238
but they operate independently.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.607
On private property, they
have full police powers.

20:06.609 --> 20:09.243
Carry firearms. Make arrests.

20:09.245 --> 20:11.411
But they're not subject
to our rules and regs.

20:11.413 --> 20:13.046
How is that legal?

20:13.048 --> 20:14.414
There's 2,000 of them in the city.

20:14.416 --> 20:16.717
And more coming if Alderman
Mac Kenzie has his way.

20:16.719 --> 20:18.599
Pretty soon, they'll be
patrolling Lincoln Park.

20:20.556 --> 20:22.723
- Intelligence.
- I think it's complete BS.

20:22.725 --> 20:24.458
With that said, if I ever get fired

20:24.460 --> 20:26.360
'cause somebody gets me on video
for one of the million things

20:26.362 --> 20:27.928
they come after us for, now,
I'll be the first one in line

20:27.930 --> 20:29.129
to get an implication.

20:29.131 --> 20:30.731
- Yeah.
- Copy that.

20:30.733 --> 20:32.566
That was ASA Kot.

20:32.568 --> 20:34.368
He said we don't have
enough probable cause

20:34.370 --> 20:35.936
for a subpoena on
the rent-a-cops.

20:35.938 --> 20:40.140
So, that means we go ahead and get some.

20:47.449 --> 20:50.484
Hey, it's me.

20:50.486 --> 20:52.252
I'm sorry.

20:52.254 --> 20:55.455
Give me a call.

20:58.394 --> 21:02.429
Hey, hi.

21:02.431 --> 21:03.831
What's the matter?

21:03.833 --> 21:05.833
You look upset.

21:05.835 --> 21:07.601
Jimmy's not my father.

21:07.603 --> 21:10.404
I ran his DNA.

21:10.406 --> 21:11.839
What?

21:11.841 --> 21:13.240
No...

21:13.242 --> 21:16.109
Are you... 99.9% sure.

21:16.111 --> 21:17.711
Forensics analyzed a coffee cup

21:17.713 --> 21:20.547
with his saliva on it.

21:20.549 --> 21:23.350
Who sent it in?

21:23.352 --> 21:25.285
That's what matters to you right now?

21:25.287 --> 21:27.454
No. I don't believe this.

21:27.456 --> 21:31.458
All this time, I thought he was.

21:31.460 --> 21:34.528
What game are you running?

21:34.530 --> 21:36.463
Do you think that I'm gonna
send Jimmy pictures of you

21:36.465 --> 21:39.533
for 15 years to run a con?

21:39.535 --> 21:44.304
I thought he was your dad.

21:44.306 --> 21:48.709
Do you want to tell him or should I?

21:48.711 --> 21:50.544
Well, Erin. He...

21:50.546 --> 21:52.913
He really cares about you.

21:52.915 --> 21:53.947
Maybe...

21:53.949 --> 21:57.150
Maybe you don't have to tell him.

22:00.656 --> 22:04.825
Why do you keep doing this to me?

22:17.877 --> 22:22.114
What's going on with you and Erin?

22:22.116 --> 22:24.550
Um, Sarge. That's...

22:24.552 --> 22:25.951
A personal matter.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.953
You should probably talk to Erin.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.622
You know, I turned a blind eye

22:29.624 --> 22:32.858
to you two being a couple in my unit.

22:32.860 --> 22:34.360
So, when I ask one of you a question,

22:34.362 --> 22:36.128
as a courtesy to me,

22:36.130 --> 22:38.564
you can answer for the other.

22:38.566 --> 22:39.965
Okay.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.967
Um...

22:41.969 --> 22:43.769
Jimmy's not her dad.

22:43.771 --> 22:45.971
And I'm the bad guy.

22:47.141 --> 22:48.974
What am I signing up for?

22:48.976 --> 22:50.976
In terms of her mom?

22:50.978 --> 22:53.712
I imagine you got a pretty good idea.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.018
Patrol just picked up
one of Emily's friends.

22:59.020 --> 23:01.820
He says that she got
into an argument...

23:01.822 --> 23:04.323
A screaming match with
Sandford Greg three days ago.

23:04.325 --> 23:07.259
Which differs from what she told you.

23:07.261 --> 23:08.360
Yeah.

23:08.362 --> 23:09.995
I'll take another crack at her.

23:09.997 --> 23:13.165
It's Al's turn.

23:13.167 --> 23:15.567
With me in the room, or?

23:15.569 --> 23:19.772
Just Al.

23:22.877 --> 23:24.877
Well, we've got an eyewitness

23:24.879 --> 23:26.545
that's saying that...

23:26.547 --> 23:28.881
You went off on Sandford Greg

23:28.883 --> 23:30.849
at the Park last week.

23:30.851 --> 23:33.452
- Yeah.
- All right.

23:33.454 --> 23:34.853
He put it out there he had some dope.

23:34.855 --> 23:38.457
I went to buy one off him.

23:38.459 --> 23:41.260
He said I had to kiss him first
so I told him to go to hell.

23:41.262 --> 23:44.296
So, you... you lied to
us about knowing him?

23:44.298 --> 23:46.031
I was nervous, okay?

23:46.033 --> 23:47.866
And I've been very careful
about what I say to you guys.

23:47.868 --> 23:50.903
So, I guess, I just left that out.

23:50.905 --> 23:53.706
You want to get
something off your chest?

23:53.708 --> 23:55.908
I mean, I can tell.

23:55.910 --> 23:56.875
What's going on?

23:56.877 --> 23:58.711
You guys zeroed in on me

23:58.713 --> 24:01.080
the moment I walked in here.

24:01.082 --> 24:02.681
You haven't believed a word I said.

24:02.683 --> 24:03.916
That... That lady cop.

24:03.918 --> 24:05.484
She was just setting a trap. No.

24:05.486 --> 24:06.852
And now here you are, springing it.

24:06.854 --> 24:08.821
Hey, hey, hey. We were
just trying to help you.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.823
That guy tried to rape me.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.991
Who knows what he would have done after?

24:12.993 --> 24:14.093
I don't care how many times

24:14.095 --> 24:15.728
I ran across him prior to that night.

24:15.730 --> 24:17.930
That's what he tried to do.

24:17.932 --> 24:19.331
And I defended myself.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.566
And then I ran.

24:20.568 --> 24:22.000
And I keep telling you guys that,

24:22.002 --> 24:23.569
but you don't care.

24:23.571 --> 24:25.003
You're gonna charge me with murder.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.573
You had your mind made up yesterday.

24:27.575 --> 24:29.174
I didn't have nothing
else to say to you.

24:29.176 --> 24:32.111
Okay? I shouldn't have
said anything to begin with.

24:32.113 --> 24:33.545
I want a lawyer.

24:33.547 --> 24:36.648
A public defender.
Whatever you call them.

24:56.937 --> 24:59.138
Hey.

24:59.140 --> 25:02.975
Hey.

25:02.977 --> 25:06.345
Well, now we know.

25:06.347 --> 25:09.982
Yeah.

25:09.984 --> 25:14.153
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry for any...

25:14.155 --> 25:15.754
Like, I don't know. I
don't know what to say.

25:15.756 --> 25:18.157
Look, I'm glad you ran the tests.

25:18.159 --> 25:19.992
Because...

25:19.994 --> 25:22.628
It saved me a lot of time.

25:28.836 --> 25:32.237
What the hell was this?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.873
What did you two want?

25:34.875 --> 25:37.242
Nothing. I didn't want...

25:37.244 --> 25:40.345
don't you and Bunny ever call me again.

25:41.849 --> 25:46.919
You do, and I swear to
God, I'll call the Feds.

25:46.921 --> 25:51.256
They got a whole division
for scam artists like you.

26:10.578 --> 26:11.877
- Hey, Sarge.
- Yeah.

26:11.879 --> 26:13.245
There's two homicides
in the Linden Homes.

26:13.247 --> 26:15.881
Both ruled domestics and
cleared by area central homicide.

26:15.883 --> 26:16.815
I came across this, though.

26:16.817 --> 26:19.051
A male OD'd in an abandoned apartment.

26:19.053 --> 26:20.352
He had no drug priors.

26:20.354 --> 26:21.854
Found with a needle
hanging out of his arm.

26:21.856 --> 26:23.722
Guess what officer found the body.

26:23.724 --> 26:24.890
Lowdell.

26:24.892 --> 26:25.891
Yeah, the body's still at the morgue.

26:25.893 --> 26:27.926
Hasn't been claimed yet.

26:30.364 --> 26:31.563
There's your boy.

26:31.565 --> 26:33.332
Got in here just in time, too.

26:33.334 --> 26:35.534
Death certificate came in yesterday.

26:35.536 --> 26:38.337
Otherwise, you'd be doing an exhumation.

26:38.339 --> 26:40.672
What'd the original autopsy say?

26:40.674 --> 26:43.842
The detective who responded
said it looked like an overdose.

26:43.844 --> 26:45.878
Walks like a duck.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.045
Mind if we take a look?

26:47.047 --> 26:49.248
Have at it.

26:51.852 --> 26:53.685
What's with all these
spots around his eyes?

26:53.687 --> 26:55.687
Petechiae and tracheal bruising.

26:55.689 --> 26:57.689
Like your other guy.

26:57.691 --> 26:59.224
So, he was strangled?

26:59.226 --> 27:03.462
Odds are.

27:03.464 --> 27:05.664
Anything in your pocket gonna stick me?

27:05.666 --> 27:07.466
Get the hell off me.

27:07.468 --> 27:08.967
Agh! What'd I tell you

27:08.969 --> 27:10.936
about smoking dope back here, Oscar?

27:14.909 --> 27:18.343
You need something?

27:18.345 --> 27:21.647
Hank Voight. Guess we haven't met.

27:27.895 --> 27:29.563
Hey, Chicago PD ain't perfect.

27:29.565 --> 27:30.497
I'm the first to admit it.

27:30.499 --> 27:31.698
You guys provide a service.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.533
Private citizens want to pay for it.

27:33.535 --> 27:35.535
It's all good.

27:35.537 --> 27:37.704
There are laws in this city.

27:37.706 --> 27:39.506
I'm aware of that.

27:39.508 --> 27:42.909
Well, I'm sensing a troubling pattern.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.711
Like, people are getting hurt or worse,

27:44.713 --> 27:46.179
when you guys respond.

27:46.181 --> 27:49.082
Look, before we get into
warrants, probable cause,

27:49.084 --> 27:50.483
and this turns into a pissing match.

27:50.485 --> 27:52.485
I'm thinking, just...

27:52.487 --> 27:55.055
Cop to cop, you and I can
talk about the problem,

27:55.057 --> 27:56.656
how to fix it.

27:56.658 --> 27:59.492
I appreciate you coming
in. I appreciate the offer.

27:59.494 --> 28:01.461
But there's no problem here.

28:01.463 --> 28:05.098
I hope you don't take offense...

28:05.100 --> 28:07.300
I ran your record.

28:07.302 --> 28:08.702
You were on the job in Milwaukee

28:08.704 --> 28:12.339
when a questionable shooting went down.

28:12.341 --> 28:13.940
There's a gag order on that.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.944
Apparently your sergeant
took two steps back,

28:17.946 --> 28:20.714
and you and another patrolman
ended up getting burned,

28:20.716 --> 28:22.349
and taking the fall.

28:22.351 --> 28:24.551
That's what it looked
like to me, anyway.

28:25.721 --> 28:27.153
Look, sergeant, I'm going to find out

28:27.155 --> 28:28.622
what's going on here
and I'm going to find out

28:28.624 --> 28:31.224
what happened to Sandford Greg.

28:31.226 --> 28:32.525
And you digging your heels in,

28:32.527 --> 28:35.228
all that does is make
your men more vulnerable.

28:35.230 --> 28:37.230
And having already been
through that yourself,

28:37.232 --> 28:40.634
I'd think that'd be something
you'd want to protect them from.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.535
I know how overwhelmed you guys are

28:42.537 --> 28:44.704
with the murder rate in this city...

28:44.706 --> 28:46.907
You should spend your time on that.

28:46.909 --> 28:48.341
Don't worry about Linden Homes.

28:48.343 --> 28:52.545
We've got it covered.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.617
This guy.

28:57.619 --> 28:59.586
I talked to a former officer
for the Special Police,

28:59.588 --> 29:01.621
who's now in CPD with us.

29:01.623 --> 29:03.290
He spent a couple of
months at Linden Homes.

29:03.292 --> 29:05.492
Claims Lowdell has a bounty system.

29:05.494 --> 29:06.860
Says cash bonuses are paid out

29:06.862 --> 29:08.495
when problem tenants are evicted.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.696
Can you prove it?

29:09.698 --> 29:11.932
No. He said it was an
open secret, though.

29:11.934 --> 29:13.333
Doesn't do us much good.

29:13.335 --> 29:14.534
Well, thing is, though...

29:14.536 --> 29:15.835
I mean, we ran backgrounds on them.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.437
Everybody who works under Lowdell

29:17.439 --> 29:18.838
seem like pretty good cops to me.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.840
Cops run in packs like wolves.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.043
If the Alpha's a bully...

29:23.045 --> 29:24.544
So, I checked the residence rolls

29:24.546 --> 29:26.112
for the past 12 months at Linden.

29:26.114 --> 29:28.848
The woman who made the original
complaint against Sandford Greg,

29:28.850 --> 29:30.850
she's still there. Just
in a different apartment,

29:30.852 --> 29:33.286
apparently, never reported
the address change.

29:33.288 --> 29:35.455
Charmain Stewart, 966.

29:35.457 --> 29:38.625
Kevin, you and Kenny.

29:52.808 --> 29:55.075
- Chicago PD.
- Charmaine Stewart?

29:55.077 --> 29:56.476
Who wants to know?

29:56.478 --> 29:58.244
I'm detective Rixton.
This is officer Atwater.

29:58.246 --> 29:59.512
You guys Special Police?

29:59.514 --> 30:01.681
We're actually with the City, ma'am.

30:01.683 --> 30:03.483
Sandford Greg. You remember this guy?

30:03.485 --> 30:04.718
You filed a complaint against him.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.520
Not like I could forget that psycho.

30:07.522 --> 30:08.888
What the hell he do now?

30:08.890 --> 30:11.891
He got murdered.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.893
What kind of relationship
did you have with him?

30:13.895 --> 30:16.696
We had a thing for a minute...

30:16.698 --> 30:20.900
When he got violent with
me, I kicked his ass out.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.103
You seen him around at all lately?

30:23.105 --> 30:25.338
He came by last night.

30:25.340 --> 30:26.706
Pounding on my door.

30:26.708 --> 30:28.708
- Did you let him in?
- Hell no.

30:28.710 --> 30:32.545
He was high and hooting
and hollering, and...

30:32.547 --> 30:33.913
Looked like he'd been injured.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.915
- What'd you do?
- What I always do.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.517
Call the Special Police.

30:37.519 --> 30:39.452
Okay, so, what did they
do when they got here?

30:39.454 --> 30:41.054
Their job.

30:41.056 --> 30:44.624
Which is more than I
can say for Chicago PD.

30:44.626 --> 30:46.693
You've got no clue.

30:46.695 --> 30:49.062
This place used to be a mad house.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.865
How many officers responded?

30:51.867 --> 30:54.267
Just one. Moony, I think.

30:54.269 --> 30:58.304
And... hoo! He was
pissed when he saw Sandford.

30:58.306 --> 30:59.472
Can't blame him.

30:59.474 --> 31:01.674
All right. Thanks for your help.

31:01.676 --> 31:04.310
Appreciate it.

31:04.312 --> 31:06.679
James Moony. He's 22 years old.

31:06.681 --> 31:08.515
He grew up in Garfield Park.

31:08.517 --> 31:10.683
All-city wrestler, and he
studied criminal justice

31:10.685 --> 31:12.519
at City College. He's
currently number six

31:12.521 --> 31:14.087
in the hiring list for Chicago PD.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.489
He's been with the
Special Police how long?

31:16.491 --> 31:18.091
Three months and change.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.492
All right. Grab him up.

31:19.494 --> 31:22.095
But don't go in hard. He's
practically one of ours.

31:22.097 --> 31:23.897
Hank.

31:23.899 --> 31:25.498
Bunny Fletcher is here.

31:25.500 --> 31:28.568
She says she's not leaving
until she talks to you.

31:40.615 --> 31:43.683
Something I can help you with?

31:43.685 --> 31:46.453
You know, I thought
Jimmy was Erin's father.

31:46.455 --> 31:48.721
And you run a DNA test?

31:48.723 --> 31:51.624
How dare you.

31:51.626 --> 31:53.593
You've been drinking, Bunny?

31:53.595 --> 31:56.629
You couldn't have me
so you took my daughter.

31:56.631 --> 31:58.331
And you're still doing it.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.133
You know? I think maybe Erin

32:00.135 --> 32:04.504
should run a DNA test on you.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.905
I'm going to say something

32:05.907 --> 32:10.143
that I probably haven't
said in 30 years.

32:10.145 --> 32:13.146
You wish.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.882
You'd love to think that
that night never happened,

32:15.884 --> 32:18.284
wouldn't you?

32:35.337 --> 32:36.903
Something I can help you guys with?

32:36.905 --> 32:38.505
Put your shoes on, James.
We need you to come down

32:38.507 --> 32:39.506
to the district with us.

32:39.508 --> 32:41.774
- For what?
- Answer a few questions.

32:41.776 --> 32:43.776
Regarding?

32:43.778 --> 32:46.613
Sandford Greg.

32:46.615 --> 32:48.781
James, what's going on?

32:48.783 --> 32:50.016
Is this a friendly conversation,

32:50.018 --> 32:52.218
or am I a person of interest?

32:52.220 --> 32:54.020
- Put your shoes on, James.
- Don't jerk me off, all right.

32:54.022 --> 32:55.622
I've been doing this for a living too.

32:55.624 --> 32:57.223
What's going on? James.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.625
You've got your wife right here.

32:58.627 --> 33:00.460
You want to get hostile, we can do that.

33:00.462 --> 33:02.462
We'd prefer to keep it friendly.

33:02.464 --> 33:05.465
James.

33:05.467 --> 33:06.833
I'll be back, sweetheart.

33:06.835 --> 33:08.902
It's all right.

33:13.808 --> 33:16.442
Not necessary.

33:22.551 --> 33:24.083
We got an eyewitness.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.753
Has you as the last person
to put hands on Sandford Greg

33:26.755 --> 33:28.555
the night that he died.

33:28.557 --> 33:31.391
That doesn't prove anything.

33:31.393 --> 33:33.026
Tox report indicates that Greg was high,

33:33.028 --> 33:34.194
so I don't know what happened.

33:34.196 --> 33:35.562
Maybe you got a little over-zealous...

33:35.564 --> 33:36.896
Restraining him.

33:36.898 --> 33:39.432
You choke him out?

33:39.434 --> 33:40.900
Look, man. Come clean with us,

33:40.902 --> 33:42.902
and we will try to work something out.

33:42.904 --> 33:44.704
You know who that guy is?

33:44.706 --> 33:46.539
What he's done?

33:46.541 --> 33:47.907
Are we seriously
having this conversation

33:47.909 --> 33:49.108
about Sandford Greg?

33:49.110 --> 33:52.545
Yeah, we are. He was murdered.

33:52.547 --> 33:56.516
If you ever want to
become a real cop, James...

33:56.518 --> 33:58.551
Now's the time to start talking.

33:58.553 --> 34:00.954
And who would that be
good for? For you guys?

34:00.956 --> 34:02.622
For your clearance record?

34:02.624 --> 34:04.023
What about me?

34:04.025 --> 34:06.259
Your sergeant.

34:06.261 --> 34:09.027
He put you up to this?

34:09.030 --> 34:12.065
Make it known that he
wanted this kind of behavior?

34:12.067 --> 34:15.868
If that's the case, James, let us know.

34:15.870 --> 34:18.071
I'm not a rat.

34:18.072 --> 34:20.072
I really understand.

34:20.074 --> 34:23.810
I do.

34:23.812 --> 34:27.513
You got a baby on the way.

34:27.514 --> 34:31.317
Know if it's a boy or a girl yet?

34:31.319 --> 34:34.520
A girl.

34:34.522 --> 34:38.257
You gotta start thinking about her.

34:40.495 --> 34:46.498
ASA Kot is here. Would like a word.

34:46.501 --> 34:50.570
- Can I get a water?
- Yeah.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.610
We got a theory?

34:57.612 --> 34:58.978
'Cause if so, I need to hear it.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.547
Everything I've heard so
far is leading to Emily Vega.

35:01.549 --> 35:03.182
Well, it's looking
like the Special Police

35:03.184 --> 35:04.450
at the Linden Homes were behind it.

35:04.452 --> 35:06.185
We got an officer Moony
in the room right now.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.353
He's copping to it?

35:07.355 --> 35:08.521
Not yet.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.857
Okay, so, let's assume he doesn't.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.058
What then?

35:12.060 --> 35:13.493
Keep working the case.

35:13.495 --> 35:16.195
But Emily Vega admitted
to stabbing our victim.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.730
Then she lied about knowing him.

35:17.732 --> 35:20.166
Hey! The door's locked...

35:20.168 --> 35:24.370
- What?
- I need a hand here.

35:26.541 --> 35:30.710
He hung himself. We need help!

35:42.057 --> 35:45.358
Come on! Come on, come on!

35:49.731 --> 35:52.832
21-01, emergency. Roll
an Ambo to the 21st.

35:52.834 --> 35:56.269
Strangulation victim, second floor.

35:56.271 --> 35:58.471
Hey!

35:58.473 --> 36:01.174
Hey! Come on! Hey!

36:01.176 --> 36:04.610
Hey, no, get down!

36:04.612 --> 36:07.380
Stop moving! Stop moving.

36:14.943 --> 36:19.146
You don't try to hang
yourself unless you're guilty.

36:19.148 --> 36:20.247
I think what you meant to say is,

36:20.249 --> 36:22.249
"thank God he's alive," counselor.

36:22.251 --> 36:23.584
Of course, I'm glad.

36:23.586 --> 36:25.219
But after his psych eval,

36:25.221 --> 36:27.688
we're charging him with
the murder of Sandford Greg.

36:27.690 --> 36:30.491
What about Emily Vega?

36:30.493 --> 36:33.260
Kick her.

36:33.262 --> 36:35.062
Sergeant Lowdell.

36:35.064 --> 36:39.266
- You got a minute?
- I do.

36:41.604 --> 36:45.706
Sixth on the list for CPD.

36:45.708 --> 36:49.410
Got hooked up with the wrong crew.

36:49.412 --> 36:51.478
Yeah.

36:57.620 --> 36:59.453
So Moony gonna recover?

36:59.455 --> 37:03.224
It looks like.

37:03.226 --> 37:04.525
What are you gonna charge him with?

37:04.527 --> 37:07.695
Homicide.

37:07.697 --> 37:11.899
You mentioned Milwaukee.

37:14.537 --> 37:17.504
We were executing a search warrant.

37:17.506 --> 37:22.142
The sergeant's CI had ID'd
the house we stacked outside.

37:22.144 --> 37:26.347
Our sarge says, "don't bother
announcing, just hit the door."

37:26.349 --> 37:28.349
Inside, there was a guy with a gun.

37:28.351 --> 37:31.518
Lawfully, as it turned
out. He had a permit.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.153
Anyway.

37:33.155 --> 37:35.155
He drew.

37:35.157 --> 37:37.524
My partner and I shot him.

37:37.526 --> 37:39.226
Turned out, we had the wrong house.

37:39.228 --> 37:41.428
The CI screwed up.

37:41.430 --> 37:46.433
And afterward, our sergeant
told us to say we did announce.

37:46.435 --> 37:49.603
But when IAD looked
into it, he denied that.

37:49.605 --> 37:53.440
So, we got terminated even
though we were following orders.

37:53.442 --> 37:55.042
I'm sorry.

37:55.044 --> 37:56.477
I've worked with people like that.

37:56.479 --> 37:58.846
This guy, Sandford...

37:58.848 --> 38:02.283
He'd show up, harass
people. Young girls.

38:02.285 --> 38:05.653
He had been warned verbally
and in writing to keep away.

38:05.655 --> 38:08.722
When Moony responded...

38:12.295 --> 38:15.462
What if I was the one
who moved the body?

38:15.464 --> 38:19.867
You'd have to testify to that.

38:19.869 --> 38:22.236
Only if it knocks Moony's sentence down.

38:22.238 --> 38:23.904
I'll push for involuntary manslaughter

38:23.906 --> 38:25.906
instead of murder, but...

38:25.908 --> 38:28.108
You're going to be charged
with concealing a homicide.

38:32.515 --> 38:36.050
- I want it in writing.
- You'll get it.

38:38.921 --> 38:41.989
Moony was following orders.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.668
So, that's... That's it?

38:54.670 --> 38:57.471
That's it. You are free to go.

38:57.473 --> 38:59.139
Okay.

38:59.141 --> 39:01.675
Emily, it is not too late
to get your life together.

39:01.677 --> 39:03.944
I can help you get into a drug
and alcohol treatment program.

39:03.946 --> 39:05.746
There's... look, there's
residential rehab.

39:05.748 --> 39:09.350
Outpatient, sober living.
Just whatever you need.

39:09.352 --> 39:11.352
And I would be there.

39:11.354 --> 39:15.723
Every step of the way, you have my word.

39:15.725 --> 39:17.958
Food for thought.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.561
Food for thought.

39:20.563 --> 39:22.763
I'll call you. Thanks.

39:39.815 --> 39:41.815
She didn't want to hear it.

39:41.817 --> 39:43.817
Well...

39:43.819 --> 39:47.988
Don't let that stop you
from saying it, though.

40:00.369 --> 40:02.703
It's not like she's going
to change at this point,

40:02.705 --> 40:04.872
you know? Your mom is who she is.

40:04.874 --> 40:07.708
Yeah, I know.

40:07.710 --> 40:11.712
Erin... Erin, how long have I known you?

40:11.714 --> 40:14.882
Since we were like, nine, right?

40:14.884 --> 40:16.517
Around there.

40:16.519 --> 40:19.887
You can only try to fix
the engine so many times.

40:19.889 --> 40:21.221
You know, until it's like,

40:21.223 --> 40:23.223
screw it, you know, buy a new car.

40:23.225 --> 40:25.092
Like, Vanessa Reeder.

40:25.094 --> 40:26.693
After everything she went through,

40:26.695 --> 40:28.695
guess where she ended up?

40:28.697 --> 40:30.297
Phoenix.

40:30.299 --> 40:32.733
Got her teaching degree.

40:32.735 --> 40:35.736
Is married and has a kid on the way.

40:35.738 --> 40:37.571
She just couldn't get it together

40:37.573 --> 40:40.574
until she left Chicago.

40:40.576 --> 40:43.410
And as much as I love you, and...

40:43.412 --> 40:48.015
It would kill me to have you go...

40:52.421 --> 40:54.721
I don't know, Annie.

40:57.660 --> 40:59.159
I mean, if I could move somewhere,

40:59.161 --> 41:01.728
and start over right now...

41:01.730 --> 41:04.164
I would.

41:04.166 --> 41:07.000
What's stopping you?
