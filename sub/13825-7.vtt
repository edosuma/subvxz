01:37.013 --> 01:38.389
That's right, Thomas...

01:38.389 --> 01:41.476
...you show those pesky birds
who's boss.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.770
We've worked too hard
on this summer garden...

01:43.770 --> 01:46.314
...to have it ransacked by riffraff.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.398
Up, up.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.320
Now, let's see how my prizewinning peas
are progressing.

01:54.113 --> 01:56.950
Do you see that, Thomas?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.953
Something's been nibbling my pea pods.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.122
No, sirree, we won't have any of that.

02:03.122 --> 02:07.001
And you, Thomas,
are gonna make sure of it.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.381
That's right, you.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.841
You're gonna stand guard...

02:12.841 --> 02:16.803
...and keep this garden
free of pests and poachers.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.639
Do you understand me, Thomas?

02:19.639 --> 02:20.849
Good.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.892
Nobody's gonna mess with my garden.

04:03.701 --> 04:04.953
Huh?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.409
Yoo-hoo!

06:59.585 --> 07:01.546
Thomas!

07:01.546 --> 07:05.633
What in the name of the heavenly harvest
is going on here?

07:05.633 --> 07:08.761
Just look at my prizewinning tomatoes.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.888
This is horrible.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.142
My precious corn...

07:14.142 --> 07:16.519
...my beloved crops.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.523
You good-for-nothing garden guardian.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.276
I know just the thing
to keep you out of trouble...

07:23.276 --> 07:26.028
...and still do your job.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.759
What a tired, old cat-and-mouse routine.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.429
Hey, tomcat.

08:33.429 --> 08:37.892
Ain't you tired of never catching
that stinking mouse?

08:37.892 --> 08:42.605
Problem is, you're going about
catching mice all wrong.

08:43.147 --> 08:48.152
You got no discipline,
no game plan, no dignity.

08:48.152 --> 08:53.616
What you need, brother,
is to join me and the League of Cats.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.412
The League of Cats
is a super-secret society.

08:58.412 --> 09:02.458
Like, we got each other's backs, man.

09:03.459 --> 09:06.087
Sign this card and you're in.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.091
Attaboy.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.303
Now, the quick initiation process.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.098
And welcome to the club.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.558
Come to our secret meeting tonight.

09:19.558 --> 09:20.726
It's at...

09:23.729 --> 09:25.606
Now, listen up.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.024
This is a mouse.

09:28.192 --> 09:31.404
No, no, a picture of a mouse.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.031
This is a cat.

09:36.826 --> 09:40.413
Now, this is the old-fashioned way
of catching a mouse.

09:40.413 --> 09:44.792
The problem: the little guy just runs cycles
around the likes of us cats.

09:44.792 --> 09:48.796
This way and that way, over hill and dale,
backwards and forwards.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.965
It's enough to make you sick.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.300
Now then...

09:52.300 --> 09:54.302
...same mouse...

09:54.302 --> 09:56.095
...same cat.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.515
Only this time, the cat whistles for help
from the league.

10:05.521 --> 10:10.901
By following this simple tactic,
we'll catch us more mice with less work.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.446
This place'll be loaded with mice.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.948
We'll all be fat cats.

10:17.158 --> 10:22.997
So the next time one of youse cats
corners a mouse, just whistle.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.958
Got it?
Got it.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.270
You let him get away.

11:28.270 --> 11:31.816
It wasn't me, it was him.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.320
Okay, so we ain't
a well-oiled machine yet.

11:36.862 --> 11:40.116
But next time, we'll have a field day.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.576
We are the League of Cats.

11:42.576 --> 11:45.579
We are the league.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.413
Shh!

12:27.413 --> 12:29.665
Don't whistle till you see a mouse.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.307
What's wrong with you, cat?
There goes a mouse.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.686
Let's get him.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.588
<i>Like, when you're a cat
No mouse makes you sweat</i>

13:18.130 --> 13:21.383
<i>It ain't like we're getting
A shot at the vet</i>

13:22.092 --> 13:25.596
<i>When you're a mouse
No cats can compare</i>

13:25.596 --> 13:28.933
<i>We'll hang you out to dry
In your underwear</i>

13:29.600 --> 13:30.893
<i>Like, no way you can do it</i>

13:52.790 --> 13:56.043
<i>Cats, think twice
We ain't so nice</i>

13:56.669 --> 13:58.837
<i>We're the League of Mice</i>

14:03.342 --> 14:04.885
Hey, Butch, I think we blew it.

14:26.115 --> 14:30.202
Well, boys, I told you this place
would be loaded with mice.

15:09.199 --> 15:13.412
Well, this is certainly
a fine how-do-you-do, isn't it, Thomas?

15:13.412 --> 15:19.627
First, a heat wave that makes Death Valley
seem like a good idea for a vacation spot...

15:19.627 --> 15:22.588
...and now our air conditioner
is on the fritz...

15:22.588 --> 15:25.799
...so we can't even cool the house down.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.218
Maybe this will help.

15:34.808 --> 15:38.228
My, my, Thomas. You read my mind.

15:38.228 --> 15:44.068
We shouldn't let all this nice cool air
go to waste, now, should we?

16:04.380 --> 16:07.424
Hey, thanks, bub.

16:09.259 --> 16:14.223
Maybe we'll just take
a little catnap right here and now.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.308
What do you say?

16:16.308 --> 16:19.687
But don't you go eating anything now.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.113
That's right.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.824
Just a little...

17:33.260 --> 17:36.805
Thomas, what have you done?

17:39.266 --> 17:41.643
What do you have to say for yourself?

17:43.604 --> 17:46.231
Don't pretend you were sleeping, Thomas.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.026
"Guilty" is written all over your face.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.613
Oh, don't give me that look,
you naughty cat.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.324
I know what you did.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.912
Not so fast, mister.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.998
Don't be trying to blame it
on that little mouse.

18:03.665 --> 18:07.586
The only place a naughty cat
like you belongs is outside.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.635
Huh?
