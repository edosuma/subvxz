17:13.733 --> 17:16.203
HE STOPPED EATING.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.406

STOP COVERING FOR ME,

17:37.424 --> 17:40.327
OR AT LEAST DO
A BETTER JOB OF IT.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.330
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FISH?

17:43.396 --> 17:47.567
LOU, I ACCIDENTALLY
KILLED SPIKE.

17:47.634 --> 17:51.037
I SUCKED HIM UP IN
THAT VERY VACUUM CLEANER.

17:51.104 --> 17:54.541
OH, COME ON.
THAT'S PRETTY
HARD TO SWALLOW.

[ARGUING]

18:19.866 --> 18:20.900
ALRIGHT.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.969
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT!

18:23.035 --> 18:25.004
NOW, ONE AT A TIME.

18:25.071 --> 18:29.176
HARRIETTE, THE BOY
TURNED MY BOSS'
PET FISH INTO SUSHI.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.144
AND THIS TIMMY PROBLEM
WON'T GO AWAY.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.779
I WAS IN
THE SUPERMARKET,

18:32.845 --> 18:36.683
AND HIS MOTHER TRIED
TO HIT ME OVER THE HEAD
WITH HER HUSBAND.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.921
MOM, STEVE HAS GOT TO GO.
THAT'S RIGHT!

18:41.988 --> 18:43.690
[ARGUING]

18:43.756 --> 18:46.726
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,
OKAY, OKAY!

18:46.793 --> 18:50.597
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO TELL HIM.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.702
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.937
I WAS DOWN IN THE BASEMENT
CLEANING THE FURNACE,

18:58.004 --> 19:01.341
AND I HEARD
EVERYTHING THROUGH
THE HEATING DUCTS.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.810
I'LL JUST,
UH, HEAD HOME.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.116
STEVE...
OH, PLEASE.

19:10.183 --> 19:14.354
I DON'T DESERVE TO BE
AROUND CIVILIZED PEOPLE.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.922
YOU GUYS
WERE NICE ENOUGH

19:15.988 --> 19:17.557
TO LET ME STAY
IN YOUR HOME,

19:17.624 --> 19:21.060
AND, AND I WANTED
TO REPAY YOU.

19:21.127 --> 19:24.297
BUT INSTEAD I MESSED
EVERYTHING UP...

19:24.364 --> 19:26.533
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.902
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.705
UNCLE STEVE
HELPED ME.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.474

19:39.178 --> 19:42.515
BUT, MOM, A BULLY
WAS PICKING ON ME.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.817
A BULLY?

19:44.884 --> 19:46.286
WHY, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.256
YEAH, AND I WAS AFRAID
TO GO TO SCHOOL,

19:49.322 --> 19:51.524
BUT I'M NOT ANYMORE.

ABOUT YOUR STUDY DATE.

20:01.934 --> 20:02.935

20:03.002 --> 20:05.338
IF THAT'S HIS REAL NAME.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.208
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

20:09.276 --> 20:12.512
WELL, LAST NIGHT I SAW HIM
ON MAKE-OUT MOUNTAIN,

20:12.579 --> 20:17.250
AND HE WAS LIP-LOCKED
WITH A SASSY LITTLE REDHEAD.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.520
THAT'S LISA TEMPLEMAN.
HE TOLD ME HE WAS
BREAKING UP WITH HER.

20:20.587 --> 20:25.625
MM-HMM. WELL,

HECK OF A GOODBYE KISS.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.163
UH, MOM...

TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.941
YOU SEE?

20:42.008 --> 20:43.743
THERE IS A SILVER LINING

20:43.810 --> 20:46.679
AROUND ALL OF
STEVE'S DARK CLOUDS.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.884
STEVE, SIT DOWN.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.789

20:56.856 --> 20:58.491
WHEN WE
ASKED YOU TO STAY,

20:58.558 --> 21:00.527
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
DO ALL THE CLEANING

21:00.593 --> 21:02.194
AND COOKING AND LAUNDRY.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.531
WE HAVE HARRIETTE
FOR THAT.

21:09.836 --> 21:10.803

21:10.870 --> 21:12.339
[CHUCKLING]

21:12.405 --> 21:14.206
STEVE, WHEN WE
ASKED YOU TO STAY,

21:14.273 --> 21:16.409
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS JUST STAY.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.710

SO WHAT WILL YOU DO
THE NEXT TIME YOU STAY?

21:22.582 --> 21:25.885
I'LL RELAX.
I WON'T TRY SO HARD.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.355
I'LL JUST STAY.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.823

21:38.565 --> 21:43.202
GEE, THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL,
WARM, TOUCHING MOMENT.

21:43.269 --> 21:46.373
DO I FEEL A GROUP HUG
COMING ON?

21:46.439 --> 21:48.274
NO.
NO.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.676
I DIDN'T THINK SO,

21:49.742 --> 21:50.677
SO LET'S DANCE

21:50.743 --> 21:53.279
