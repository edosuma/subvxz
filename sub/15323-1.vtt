WEBVTT

00:24.758 --> 00:27.595
SARA?

00:27.595 --> 00:29.096
SARA?

00:39.106 --> 00:42.476
BED BY 8:00, OKAY, JANEY?

00:42.476 --> 00:43.511
WE ALREADY DROPPED TWO CHARGES
AND KNOCKED A YEAR

00:43.511 --> 00:44.645
OFF THE DAMN SENTENCE.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.580
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY
TO ME?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.682
THE SHOW IS OVER!
PUT ANOTHER ONE ON.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.017
DON'T LET HIM TALK YOU
INTO ANO--
SARA.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.752
ONE.
LOOK, IF I DON'T HAVE A DEAL

00:51.752 --> 00:53.492
ON MY DESK
BY 8:00 A.M. TOMORROW,

00:53.517 --> 00:55.689
I WILL MAKE SURE
THE JURY HANGS HIS ASS.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.426
SORRY.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.596
WHAT'S THIS?

01:02.596 --> 01:05.166
GOT YOU A TIE FOR TONIGHT.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.001
WENT TO THAT PLACE YOU LIKED
AND TALKED TO THE LADY.

01:07.001 --> 01:09.403
YEAH, RIGHT, IT'S GREAT.
I MEAN, IT'S--I DON'T KNOW

01:09.403 --> 01:11.138
IF IT'LL BE GOOD FOR TONIGHT,
THOUGH.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.273
I GOTTA A LOOK ON MESSAGE.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.574
I GOT ALL THESE PEOPLE
COMING TO YOUR SHOW--

01:13.574 --> 01:15.643
GOVERNOR'S GUY,
CONGRESSWOMAN.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.714
YOU OKAY?

01:20.714 --> 01:22.416
JUST NERVOUS.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.486
SAW KENDRA TODAY.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.555
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE GETTING DIVORCED.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.757
UH, THAT WAS KIND OF
A TRAIN WRECK FROM THE GET-GO.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.458
THEY SEEMED REALLY IN LOVE
WHEN WE FIRST MET THEM.

01:31.458 --> 01:33.561
DID THEY, THOUGH?
I MEAN, JEFF--

01:33.561 --> 01:34.929
THAT GUY'S A JERK.

01:34.929 --> 01:38.732
AND KENDRA--SHE ISN'T EXACTLY
A WALK IN THE PARK, EITHER.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.367
STILL, AFTER TEN YEARS,

01:40.367 --> 01:42.736
HOW DOES A MARRIAGE
JUST BLOW UP LIKE THAT?

01:42.736 --> 01:45.272
SOMEONE LIGHTS A MATCH.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.114
AH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.416
ENJOY.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.600
YOU MADE ME LOOK PUGNACIOUS.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.902
OH, IT WAS YOUR IDEA,
MR. KARSTEN.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.104
YES, WELL,
THANK YOU IN ANY CASE.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.172
YOU'RE WELCOME.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.673
MAY I INTRODUCE MY SON,

02:19.673 --> 02:22.376
THATCHER ALEXANDER KARSTEN II?
HI. HI.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.544
"T.J." IS FINE.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.246
NICE TO MEET YOU, T.J.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.215
COME ON, T.J. LET'S GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

02:28.215 --> 02:31.785
WOW!
THATCHER KARSTEN CAME.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.854
WHY WOULDN'T HE?

02:33.854 --> 02:35.389
BUSY MAN.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.558
BETWEEN MERGERS,
THE ACQUISITIONS,

02:37.558 --> 02:38.959
IMPENDING LAWSUITS.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.928
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GET RICH
IN CHICAGO REAL ESTATE

02:40.928 --> 02:44.798
WITHOUT THROWING
A FEW SHARP ELBOWS.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.800
ALDERMAN'S HERE.
I GOTTA GO KISS THE RING.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.002
OH, NO, PLEASE STAY.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.137
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
SMALL TALK I HAVE LEFT IN ME.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.406
YOU...
WILL BE GREAT.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.668
PRETTY CHILLY
WITHOUT A COAT.

03:20.668 --> 03:24.905
I NEEDED SOME AIR.
IT'S QUITE A CROWD.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.742
YOU FROM THE GALLERY?

03:28.742 --> 03:30.110
YEAH.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.413
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THE OPENING?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.615
UH, MY BOSS ASKED ME
TO COME.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.884
TWISTED YOUR ARM.

03:36.884 --> 03:41.121
UH, THIS STUFF'S
NOT MY THING. I, UH...

03:43.023 --> 03:44.291
HERE.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.492
OH, NO, REALLY.
IT'S...

03:45.492 --> 03:48.729
NO, REALLY.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SHIVERING.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.766
THANK YOU.
YEAH.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.174
WHAT'S NOT YOUR THING?

04:00.174 --> 04:01.809
OH, ART.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.080
I'M MORE INTO THE, YOU KNOW,
REAL LIFE STUFF--

04:06.080 --> 04:08.816
WHERE YOU CAN SEE
AND HOLD ONTO, TOUCH.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.452
YOU KNOW, I...

04:11.452 --> 04:12.619
TO ME, THAT'S WHAT
MATTERS IN LIFE,

04:12.619 --> 04:16.123
NOT--NOT HOW PEOPLE
DREAM IT.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.325
YOU PREFER REALISM.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.960
AND WILL FERRELL MOVIES.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.100
THERE'S, UH,
SOME PHOTOGRAPHY IN THERE, TOO.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.234
IT'S KIND OF REAL.

04:27.234 --> 04:31.472
I'VE, UM, I'VE HEARD
IT'S NOT TOO BAD.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.441
OH, NO, YOU'RE--YOU'RE NOT
THE ARTIST, ARE YOU?

04:36.310 --> 04:38.145
IT'S A GROUP SHOW.
I'M ONE OF THEM.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.646
SHOULD I EAT MY SHOE NOW?

04:41.048 --> 04:42.649
SCOTCH AND SODA, TWIST.

04:42.649 --> 04:43.650
COMING UP.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.459
THANK YOU.
YES, SIR.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.462
...FRAMING, THE ANGLE,
THE EXPOSURE,

04:55.462 --> 04:57.231
TRYING TO CONVEY SOMETHING,

04:57.231 --> 05:00.167
LIKE AN IMAGE THAT YOU SEE
IN YOUR MIND'S EYE

05:00.167 --> 05:04.905
OR... THE WAY THAT YOU...
DREAM IT.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.408
YOU DO, YOU MEAN--
DREAM IT.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.376
YOU ARE THE ARTIST.

05:09.376 --> 05:12.746
OKAY, THE WAY<i> I</i> DREAM IT.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.553
NOT A BAD VIEW.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.289
IT'S--YOU CAN ALMOST
SEE THE LAKE FROM HERE.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.892
I LOVE THE WATER.
I MISS THE WATER.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.461
WHEN THAT WOULD HAPPEN,

05:27.461 --> 05:29.997
MY SISTER AND I USED
TO SAY, "DIAMOND ROSE."

05:29.997 --> 05:32.866
"DIAMOND ROSE"?
I THOUGHT IT WAS "JINX."

05:34.601 --> 05:37.070
ANYWAY, YOU WERE SAYING?

05:37.070 --> 05:38.872
OH,
I-I GREW UP ON THE WATER,

05:38.872 --> 05:40.841
IMAGINING I'D END UP
A WRECK DIVER,

05:40.841 --> 05:44.878
SEARCHING FOR LOST GOLD
AT THE BOTTOM OF LAKE MICHIGAN.

05:46.613 --> 05:47.748
IT'S CRAZY.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.684
SO YOU NEVER FOUND
YOUR TREASURE.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.456
STILL LOOKING, I GUESS.

05:57.191 --> 06:00.127
YOU LIVE HERE, BUT YOU SPEND
YOUR LIFE RUSHING AROUND.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.596
YOU FORGET
HOW CLOSE IT IS--

06:02.596 --> 06:04.164
WATER AND THE OPEN SPACE.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.167
YOU LOSE SIGHT OF THINGS.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.838
<i>YOU</i> DO, YOU MEAN.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.947
THANK YOU.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.249
I SHOULD GET BACK INSIDE.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.418
GOOD LUCK WITH THE SHOW.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.325
GOOD LUCK
DIVING FOR WRECKS.

06:35.462 --> 06:36.997
THANK YOU SO--THANK YOU.
IT'S AMAZING.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.366
MY BEAUTIFUL ARTISTE.

06:39.366 --> 06:42.336
I LOVE THE LANDSCAPES
IN THE EAST WING.
OHH!

07:02.189 --> 07:05.192
-- Captions by VITAC --

07:09.129 --> 07:11.598
YEAH. IT'S ALMOST
A MILLION BUCKS.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.234
IT'S A COMPANY CALLED
MULTINATIONAL BUILDERS' CORP.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.503
YEAH.

07:16.503 --> 07:20.307
UH... YEAH. JUST GET
INTO FORENSICS ON THAT.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.644

07:30.288 --> 07:31.985
WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:31.985 --> 07:34.721
UH...
THE GALLERY REFERRED ME.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.657
I-I NEEDED TO GET
A PHOTO FRAMED.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.825
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
INTO THAT STUFF.

07:38.825 --> 07:42.296
WELL, I-I SAW ONE
THAT CHANGED MY MIND.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.597
IT'S YOURS...

07:43.597 --> 07:45.165
WOW.
IN FACT.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.901
YOU BOUGHT THAT?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.003
I STOLE IT.
CAT BURGLAR TYPE THING.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.805
YOU KNOW,
SNUCK IN LATE AT NIGHT.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.206
IT WASN'T EVEN IN THE SHOW.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.341
YEAH, THEY SHOWED ME
THE SECRET ARTSY STASH

07:54.341 --> 07:55.542
IN THE BACK ROOM.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.947
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE THIS FRAMING GUY

07:59.947 --> 08:01.248
WHO'S REALLY GOOD.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.383
I'LL TELL HIM HOW I WANT IT
MATTED, FRAMED ALL PER

08:03.383 --> 08:05.852
"ARTIST'S" INSTRUCTIONS,
AND BEST PART IS,

08:05.852 --> 08:07.788
IT'LL COST YOU
EXACTLY NOTHING.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.957
SOUNDS LIKE AN OFFER
I CAN'T REFUSE.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.993
GOOD. I'LL... I'LL LET YOU
KNOW WHEN IT'S DONE.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.795
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.764
I MEAN...
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.433
THE--THE PHOTO'S...

08:21.868 --> 08:24.538
UH... HERE.
YOU--YOU MIGHT NEED THIS.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.710
RIGHT. UH...
"JACK McALLISTER."

08:29.710 --> 08:32.279
AND YOU ARE SARA HANLEY.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.616
AH. NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.751
Y-YEAH.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.420
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.265
WELL, THE KITCHEN
IN THE RESTAURANT

08:52.265 --> 08:53.333
FLOODED AGAIN.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.199
THEY SAID IT'S GONNA COST
$4,000 TO FIX,

08:56.199 --> 08:58.271
BUT I DON'T KNOW. I JUST FEEL
LIKE I SHOULD REALLY REDO IT.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.071
BUT THEN THAT'S GONNA BE
10 GRAND,

09:01.071 --> 09:02.442
PLUSH I HAVE TO SHUT DOWN
FOR THREE WEEKS.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.111
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME ASK
YOUR DAD FOR A LITTLE HELP?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.345
I'M SURE HE WON'T MIND.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.947
YEAH.
OF COURSE HE WON'T MIND.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.016
HE LOANS ME MONEY TO RESCUE
THIS BUSINESS

09:09.016 --> 09:10.751
THAT HE NEVER WANTED ME
TO START,

09:10.751 --> 09:14.388
AND THEN HE CONTROLS ME THE WAY
HE CONTROLS EVERYBODY ELSE.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.822
I'M SORRY.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.125
I DIDN'T...
I DIDN'T MEAN...

09:18.125 --> 09:20.315
YOU KNOW I JUST WANT
THIS CAFE TO BE MINE

09:20.315 --> 09:21.317
WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

09:21.317 --> 09:24.331
WELL, YOU'RE A KARSTEN.
THERE ARE STRINGS.
I KNOW THAT,

09:24.331 --> 09:26.600
BUT THE WAY HE MAKES HIS MONEY,
THE WAY HE DOES BUSINESS--

09:26.600 --> 09:28.635
IF YOU THINK ALL THAT DIDN'T
CONTRIBUTE TO MY MOTHER AND--

09:28.635 --> 09:30.871
KAREN DIED OF A STROKE
A DECADE AGO.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.439
EASE UP ON HIM ALREADY.
IT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.141
W-WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
DEFEND HIM LIKE THAT?

09:34.141 --> 09:36.343
BECAUSE I WORK FOR HIM.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.111
BECAUSE I ALLOW MYSELF TO
APPRECIATE ALL HE'S DONE FOR US

09:38.111 --> 09:40.113
IN A WAY
THAT YOU NEVER WILL.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.416
BYE, MOM. BYE, DAD.
I'VE GOT AN EARLY BAND PRACTICE.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.717
HEY, I NEED 10 BUCKS
FOR THE TEAM PHOTO.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.919
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ABOUT
BREAKFAST? I JUST MADE EGGS.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.455
I HAD A POWER SHAKE.
I'M OFF PROTEIN. BYE.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.956
HOW ABOUT A KISS?
MM.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.692
HAVE A GOOD DAY, BY DEAR<i> PAPá!</i>

09:51.692 --> 09:53.493

10:18.323 --> 10:19.886
THANK YOU FOR TAKING HIM,
JANEY.
OF COURSE.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.822
BYE!
BYE, MOM.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.690
BYE.
YOU REALLY LIKED KARSTEN,

10:23.690 --> 10:24.691
HUH?

10:24.691 --> 10:26.793
HE DIDN'T SEEM
LIKE A BAD GUY.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.730
WELL, THE REALLY RICH ONES
NEVER DO.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.800
BY THE WAY, WHO WAS THAT MAN
OUT ON THE BALCONY?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.969
HE LOOKED FAMILIAR.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.606
HELLO?

10:39.606 --> 10:43.043
SO CONSTRUCTIONS'S ON SCHEDULE
FOR A 2014 COMPLETION.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.378
I HAD ACCOUNTING DO A BREAKDOWN
OF MATERIAL COSTS.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.347
WE'RE A LITTLE OVER.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.851
BUT NOTHING TOO WORRISOME,
RIGHT, JACK?

10:50.851 --> 10:53.220
I'M GLAD IT ALL SEEMS
IN ORDER.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.989
YOU ALWAYS DO A GOOD JOB
FOR ME, LOU.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.024
WELL, DOES THIS MEAN
HE GETS BEARS TICKETS?

10:58.024 --> 11:00.026
'CAUSE UNCLE LOU ALWAYS
TAKES ME WITH HIM

11:00.026 --> 11:02.462
WHEN YOU GIVE HIM
BEARS TICKETS.

11:02.462 --> 11:05.232
THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE IS ONE OTHER THING,
LOU.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.000
A SMALL DISCREPANCY.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.071
THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON. ALL RIGHT.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.809
HEY.
MM-HMM?

11:15.809 --> 11:18.078
REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST
MOVED IN?

11:18.078 --> 11:21.848
WE HAD MORNINGS LIKE THIS
ALL THE TIME?

11:21.848 --> 11:24.284
THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS
UNSPECIFIED PAYMENTS

11:24.284 --> 11:25.418
TO A COMPANY CALLED

11:25.418 --> 11:27.587
MULTINATIONAL BUILDERS'
CORPORATION.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.322
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

11:29.322 --> 11:30.757
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT.

11:30.757 --> 11:33.126
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO TRACK IT DOWN.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.762
MAYBE THAT PARTNER OF YOURS
CAN CLARIFY IT?

11:35.762 --> 11:37.597
WHAT'S HIS NAME? PERKINS?

11:38.163 --> 11:40.767
I MEAN, HOW MUCH
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

11:40.767 --> 11:42.569
OH. LET'S NOT QUIBBLE
OVER NUMBERS, LOU.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.238
JUST FIND OUT
WHO THIS UNKNOWN RECIPIENT

11:45.238 --> 11:47.107
OF OUR LARGESSE HAPPENS TO BE.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.942
THAT'S ALL.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.478
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT,
THATCH? I MEAN...

11:51.478 --> 11:54.648
COME ON. JACK.

11:54.648 --> 11:57.851
ARE YOU SUGGESTING I--
HE'S NOT SUGGESTING ANYTHING,
LOU.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.753
WE'RE JUST TAKING CARE
OF BUSINESS.

12:05.165 --> 12:07.627
I'LL, UH, TALK TO PERKINS.

12:20.630 --> 12:23.410
HE'S LYING.
I CAN SEE IT IN HIS EYES.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.512
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES, THATCHER.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.114
UNCLE LOU IS FAMILY.
EXACTLY.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.150
AND WHAT'S MORE SACRED
THAN THAT?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.776
I MISS THIS.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.222
ME, TOO.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.590
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,

12:36.590 --> 12:38.658
I USED TO WORK
FOR THIS GUY ON THE SOUTH SIDE--

12:38.658 --> 12:41.561
FRANKIE MALINSKY.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.697
HE HAD A RULE
YOU COULD LIVE BY.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.866
YOU, UH, YOU NEVER SAID
WHO HE WAS--

12:45.866 --> 12:48.568
THE MAN ON THE BALCONY.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.972
I... I DIDN'T GET
HIS NAME.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.307
FRANKIE USED TO SAY...

12:54.307 --> 12:56.977
"AFTER THE FIRST BETRAYAL,

12:56.977 --> 13:01.181
THERE IS NO OTHER."

13:03.648 --> 13:05.483
AND FOOD REVIEWS IS DOING
A PIECE

13:05.483 --> 13:07.243
ON THE TOP TEN SUSHI JOINTS
IN CHICAGO,

13:07.243 --> 13:09.850
SO WE NEED
SOME GREAT FISH SHOTS. SARA?

13:09.850 --> 13:12.273
SORRY?
UNLESS YOU HAVE
A MERCURY PROBLEM,

13:12.273 --> 13:14.955
IT'S ALL YOURS.
SALMON, TUNA, SQUID. GO FOR IT.

13:14.955 --> 13:16.724
YOU MENTIONED
THAT THE MAGAZINE

13:16.724 --> 13:17.825
WAS GONNA BE BRANCHING OUT
INTO FEATURES

13:17.825 --> 13:20.161
WITH A LITTLE MORE EDGE.

13:20.161 --> 13:22.730
I'D LIKE TO DO THAT--
SOMETHING MORE COMPELLING.

13:22.730 --> 13:24.226
WELL, ON WHAT TOPIC?
WHAT MOVES YOU?

13:24.226 --> 13:26.500
I HAVE A FEW THINGS
THAT I'M WORKING ON.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.902
HOW ABOUT OBSESSION?

13:27.902 --> 13:31.072
A PREOCCUPATION,
A FIXATION WITH SOMETHING?

13:31.072 --> 13:32.273
I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM.

13:32.273 --> 13:34.942
I THINK YOU REMEMBER
A CERTAIN FRENCH PUBLISHER

13:34.942 --> 13:37.078
WHO HAD ME SLACK-JAWED
FOR A MONTH.

13:37.078 --> 13:39.413
OH, YES. JEAN-CLAUDE.

13:39.413 --> 13:42.149
WELL, HOW ABOUT
A SERIES OF SHOTS OF PEOPLE

13:42.149 --> 13:44.585
CAUGHT UP IN THINGS
THEY CAN'T CONTROL?

13:44.585 --> 13:47.421
CHANGES HOW THEY LIVE
THEIR LIFE, WHO THEY ARE.

13:47.421 --> 13:49.190
WORK IT UP FOR ME.

13:49.190 --> 13:53.260
BUT JUST MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE A PERFUME AD, OKAY?

13:53.260 --> 13:55.463
OOH. JEAN-CLAUDE.

13:55.463 --> 13:57.331
MMM-MMM-MMM.

13:57.331 --> 13:59.066
LOU'S RIPPING ME OFF, JACK.

13:59.066 --> 14:00.334
I CAN FEEL IT.

14:00.334 --> 14:02.103
IT DOESN'T HELP
TO KEEP OBSESSING OVER IT.

14:02.103 --> 14:04.505
I'M NOT OBSESSING.
I'M BEING VIGILANT,

14:04.505 --> 14:06.941
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
IS WHAT I PAY<i> YOU</i> TO BE.

14:06.941 --> 14:09.043
OKAY, BUT LET'S NOT RUSH
TO ANY JUDGMENT HERE.

14:09.043 --> 14:10.811
LET'S JUST BE PRUDENT.

14:11.979 --> 14:13.180
HE'S RIGHT, POP.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.517
WE SHOULD BE PRUDENT.

14:16.517 --> 14:19.653
DO YOU REMEMBER WHY WE
BAILED OUT LOU SO MANY TIMES?

14:19.653 --> 14:22.390
GAVE HIM ALL THOSE CHANCES
TO MAKE SOMETHING OF HIMSELF?

14:22.390 --> 14:24.892
BECAUSE
HE'S KAREN'S BROTHER.

14:24.892 --> 14:28.329
TO DO THIS NOW,
TO BETRAY ME LIKE THIS...

14:28.329 --> 14:29.630
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

14:29.630 --> 14:31.332
MAYBE UNCLE LOU COULD EXPLAIN...

14:31.332 --> 14:33.334
STAY OUT OF IT, T.J.

14:33.334 --> 14:34.502
JACK McALLISTER.

14:34.502 --> 14:37.638
Oh, hi.
It's Sara... Hanley.

14:37.638 --> 14:40.508
SARA. HI.

14:40.508 --> 14:42.376
HOW ARE YA?

14:42.376 --> 14:44.745
GOOD. YOUR PRINT IS DONE.

14:44.745 --> 14:46.547
I work over at
the Pierpont Building

14:46.547 --> 14:47.848
if you'd like to
pick it up.

14:47.848 --> 14:51.385
SURE. UH...
WILL YOU BE THERE?

14:51.385 --> 14:53.988
I could, uh, I could buy you
lunch as a thank you.

14:53.988 --> 14:55.389
ACTUALLY, I HAVE TO CATCH
A TRAIN.

14:55.389 --> 14:57.224
I'M ON MY WAY OUT OF TOWN

14:57.224 --> 14:58.426
for a job.

14:58.426 --> 15:00.561
PERFECT, UH, MY OFFICE
IS RIGHT BY UNION STATION.

15:00.561 --> 15:04.465
WELL... I'M--I'M IN
A BIT OF A RUSH, SO...

15:04.465 --> 15:06.367
We could meet there.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.536
YOU KNOW, REAL QUICK,
LIKE A DRUG DEAL.

15:25.786 --> 15:27.655
I HOPE IT WASN'T
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

15:27.655 --> 15:29.190
NO, IT'S FINE.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.792
IT'S JUST, UH,
I'M WEIRD ABOUT CROWDS.

15:31.792 --> 15:32.860
AGORAPHOBIA?

15:32.860 --> 15:35.529
THEY--THEY SAY
IT'S A FEAR OF CONNECTION.

15:35.529 --> 15:38.232
OH. WOW. FREE ANALYSIS.

15:41.936 --> 15:44.038
UH, HERE YOU ARE.
OH, THANK YOU.

15:44.038 --> 15:45.973
AN EXPRESSION
OF MY APPRECIATION.

15:45.973 --> 15:47.475
IT'S, UH, DOUGHNUT HOLES
FROM LOU MITCHELL'S.

15:47.475 --> 15:49.310
OH, THANKS.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.745
WELL, WHERE YOU HEADED?

15:51.745 --> 15:55.783
UM... DUNE ACRES
TO SHOOT FISH.

15:55.783 --> 15:57.051
WELL, THAT'S NOT
VERY SPORTSMANLIKE.

15:57.051 --> 15:58.219
YOU EVER HEARD
OF CATCH AND RELEASE?

15:58.219 --> 16:01.188
OH, SUSHI.
UH, I'M THE "ARTIST," RIGHT?

16:01.188 --> 16:04.258
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW YOU'RE
GONNA TURN SUSHI INTO ART.

16:04.258 --> 16:06.160
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING

16:06.160 --> 16:08.896
THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS PLAYING
SOME SORT OF GAME WITH ME?

16:08.896 --> 16:10.731
OH, I GUESS I'M JUST
FUN LIKE THAT.

16:12.066 --> 16:14.001
OR MAYBE YOU'RE JUST
USED TO HIDING

16:14.001 --> 16:15.636
BEHIND SOME
CLEVER, CHARMING REMARK,

16:15.636 --> 16:17.238
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
SOUNDS LIKE?

16:17.238 --> 16:19.273
FEAR OF CONNECTION.

16:20.374 --> 16:21.809
<i>THIS IS THE FINAL CALL</i>

16:21.809 --> 16:23.143
<i>FOR PASSENGERS BOARDING</i>
<i>TRAIN NUMBER 5 FOR DUNE ACRES.</i>

16:23.143 --> 16:24.879
<i>PLEASE PROCEED</i>
<i>TO GATE NUMBER 3.</i>

16:24.879 --> 16:27.815
WELL, THERE'S MY TRAIN,
SO, UH, ENJOY THE PHOTO.

16:32.987 --> 16:35.589
<i>...DEPARTING FOR NEW YORK'S</i>
<i>PENN STATION IN TEN MINUTES.</i>

16:35.589 --> 16:39.260
<i>PLEASE PROCEED</i>
<i>TO THE LOWER LEVEL TRACK 8.</i>

16:43.130 --> 16:44.899
THAT TABLE'S A LITTLE WARPED.

16:44.899 --> 16:47.868
UH, SEEMS FINE TO ME.

16:47.868 --> 16:49.703
SO WHAT DID YOU COME
SEE ME ABOUT?

16:49.703 --> 16:51.639
ONE OF YOUR GIRLFRIENDS
GIVING YOU PROBLEMS AGAIN?

16:51.639 --> 16:54.074
HA! NO.

16:54.074 --> 16:55.142
NO, THAT WAS BRANDY,

16:55.142 --> 16:57.745
BUT THAT GUY DOESN'T
BOTHER HER ANYMORE.

16:57.745 --> 16:59.980
YOU FIXED THAT.

16:59.980 --> 17:02.550
IT'S POP, JACK.
HE'S NOT RIGHT.

17:02.550 --> 17:04.285
YOU MEAN ABOUT UNCLE LOU.

17:04.285 --> 17:07.421
HE WAS THE SAME WAY
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

17:07.421 --> 17:10.791
HE WAS SAD AND, LIKE,
MAD AT THE SAME TIME,

17:10.791 --> 17:14.295
LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING
ON FIRE INSIDE HIM.

17:14.295 --> 17:15.429
THAT WAS DIFFERENT,

17:15.429 --> 17:17.197
AND HE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT<i> YOU.</i>

17:17.197 --> 17:21.201
YOU WERE, TOO, RIGHT?
YOU WERE WORRIED.

17:21.201 --> 17:24.271
WE WERE ALL WORRIED
THAT YOU WOULDN'T...

17:24.271 --> 17:26.640
GET BETTER.

17:28.809 --> 17:31.245
BUT I DID.

17:31.245 --> 17:33.213
I GOT BETTER,

17:33.213 --> 17:36.083
'CAUSE YOU SAVED ME.
YOU PULLED ME OUT OF THE WATER.

17:36.083 --> 17:39.386
YEAH, YEAH,
I GOT YOU OUT.

17:46.927 --> 17:48.128
MAN, JACK.

17:48.128 --> 17:51.031
WE REALLY HAD SOME GOOD TIMES
BACK THEN, DIDN'T WE?

17:51.031 --> 17:53.200
JUST DOING WHATEVER
WE WANTED TO DO.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.437
I MEAN, WE WERE
REALLY FREE THEN, RIGHT?

17:56.437 --> 17:59.673
YEAH.

18:10.943 --> 18:12.618
EVERYBODY GROWS UP, BUDDY.

18:14.947 --> 18:17.283
YEAH.

18:40.373 --> 18:42.141
YOU DROPPED YOUR SCARF!

18:43.642 --> 18:45.678
IT GETS COLD!

18:45.678 --> 18:47.580
YOU CAME ALL THE WAY HERE
FOR THAT?

18:47.580 --> 18:48.781
NOT ONLY...

18:48.781 --> 18:50.750
YOU WHETTED MY APPETITE
FOR SOME FRESH LAKE AIR.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.486
YOU KNOW,
RELIVING MY DAYS OF YORE.

18:53.486 --> 18:55.621
DIVING FOR BURIED TREASURE?

18:55.621 --> 18:57.957
THERE'S GOLD OUT THERE.
I'M SURE OF IT.

19:00.198 --> 19:03.028
IF YOU WANNA JOIN ME,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:04.363 --> 19:07.500
I MEAN, NO PRESSURE, THOUGH.
I-I CAN GO ALONE!

19:26.185 --> 19:27.853
ALL ABOARD!

19:49.740 --> 19:52.865
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
BET YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT.

19:52.865 --> 19:55.334
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA TRY.
IT'S... UH, WOW.

19:56.969 --> 19:59.238
MY FAMILY USED TO GO OUT
ON A LITTLE FISHING BOAT

19:59.238 --> 20:03.175
DOWN THE SHORE A BIT,
EVERY SATURDAY.

20:03.175 --> 20:04.977
AND YOU WERE YOUNG
WHEN THEY DIED?

20:04.977 --> 20:06.578
YEAH, YEAH.

20:06.578 --> 20:07.880
BUT THEN I GOT LUCKY.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.348
YOU KNOW, MY--MY FATHER'S BOSS
AND HIS WIFE--

20:09.348 --> 20:11.483
THEY TOOK ME IN.
THEY RAISED ME,

20:11.483 --> 20:13.252
SENT ME TO COLLEGE,
LAW SCHOOL.

20:13.252 --> 20:17.189
AND YOUR WIFE?
HOW DID YOU MEET HER?

20:17.189 --> 20:20.058
ELAINE IS THEIR DAUGHTER.

20:20.058 --> 20:21.894
SHE'S A BIT OLDER,
SO BEFORE LONG,

20:21.894 --> 20:23.529
SHE WENT OFF TO COLLEGE.

20:23.529 --> 20:25.764
WHEN SHE CAME BACK,
I WAS 19,

20:25.764 --> 20:29.168
WORKING FOR
THE FAMILY COMPANY.

20:29.168 --> 20:31.270
SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED.

20:37.910 --> 20:39.178
GO ON. TRY.

20:40.546 --> 20:42.915
ALL RIGHT.

20:45.584 --> 20:46.819
EIGHT, NINE.

20:46.819 --> 20:48.253
TWO, YOU CHEAT.

20:48.253 --> 20:51.657
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

20:51.657 --> 20:53.058
DINNER'S ON ME.

20:55.093 --> 20:57.129
(crackling

21:01.033 --> 21:02.100
POP?

21:03.548 --> 21:05.079
YOU GOING TO THE CLUB?

21:05.504 --> 21:08.640
THAT BRANDY'S ON TONIGHT.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.784
ARE YOU GOING TO THAT THING
WITH UNCLE LOU?

21:11.134 --> 21:13.645
I WAS, BUT THEN
I THOUGHT, WHY?

21:13.645 --> 21:17.382
I COULD STAY HOME TONIGHT,
KEEP YOU COMPANY.

21:17.382 --> 21:20.886
NO. GO OUT. GO TO THE CLUB.
HAVE SOME FUN.

21:20.886 --> 21:23.455
I GOT THAT NEW GAME ON Xbox,
"RACCOON CITY"--

21:23.455 --> 21:25.290
I'M NOT A CHILD, T.J.

21:26.658 --> 21:28.093
JUST GO.

21:30.829 --> 21:33.765
COME HERE.

21:38.637 --> 21:43.242
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY, T.J.,
AND A GOOD SON.

21:43.242 --> 21:47.179
YOUR MOTHER WOULD BE PROUD
OF YOU.

21:49.481 --> 21:51.617
COULD I HELP, POP?

21:51.617 --> 21:53.151
I COULD FIND OUT
ABOUT UNCLE LOU.

21:53.151 --> 21:54.753
I COULD FIX EVERYTHING.
YOU CAN'T.

21:54.753 --> 21:57.155
BUT YOU SAID--
NEVER MIND WHAT I SAID.

21:57.155 --> 22:00.125
I COULD DO IT. I SWEAR.
T.J., STOP.

22:00.125 --> 22:01.493
PLEASE.

22:01.493 --> 22:05.597
JUST... STOP.

22:07.699 --> 22:09.701
KNOW YOUR LIMITATIONS.

22:12.704 --> 22:16.174
I TRY TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

22:16.174 --> 22:18.877
NEVER DRANK, NEVER SMOKED.

22:18.877 --> 22:20.212
NEVER DATED, REALLY.

22:20.212 --> 22:21.513
YOU WERE THE GOOD GIRL.

22:21.513 --> 22:24.016
WENT TO COLLEGE, MET DREW.

22:24.016 --> 22:26.885
EVERYBODY LOVED HIM,
AND IT WAS PERFECT.

22:26.885 --> 22:29.821
MY DAD FINALLY GOT TO DANCE
AT A WEDDING.

22:29.821 --> 22:32.591
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY SPECIAL.

22:34.636 --> 22:36.795
YEAH, YEAH, IT WAS.

22:44.836 --> 22:46.605
WE SHOULD GET THE CHECK.
LET'S GET THE CHECK.

22:48.473 --> 22:51.243
WHAT WAS IT?
UM, "DIAMOND ROSE."

22:51.243 --> 22:52.544
YEAH.

22:52.544 --> 22:53.812
"DIAMOND ROSE."

22:53.812 --> 22:56.348
YOU KNOW, THE BALCONY
THE OTHER NIGHT,

22:56.348 --> 22:59.117
THE PHOTO SHOP...

22:59.117 --> 23:00.752
THAT WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE,
RIGHT?

23:00.752 --> 23:04.856
LIKE A QUIRK OF FATE.
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

23:07.192 --> 23:09.661
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
I KEEP TELLING MYSELF.

23:09.661 --> 23:12.598
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID
AT THE TRAIN STATION

23:12.598 --> 23:14.533
ABOUT CONNECTING?

23:14.533 --> 23:18.003
IT'S TRUE. I...

23:18.003 --> 23:21.006
I-I-IT'S--IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN HARD FOR ME.

23:25.544 --> 23:27.446
BUT YOU MAKE ME
WANNA CONNECT.

23:29.615 --> 23:33.185
WHEN I SEE YOU,
I GET THIS FEELING, THIS...

23:33.185 --> 23:36.154
THIS SPARK THAT...

23:37.422 --> 23:39.358
YOU'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE.

23:41.693 --> 23:43.161
I WANT TO.

23:45.631 --> 23:47.366
DO YOU?

23:52.671 --> 23:54.172
YES.

24:06.752 --> 24:07.886
I KNOW, BUT IT'S NICE...

24:07.886 --> 24:09.988
UNCLE LOU! AUNT CONNIE!

24:09.988 --> 24:10.989
OH, GOD.

24:10.989 --> 24:12.491
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

24:12.491 --> 24:15.494
BEATS ME. I THOUGHT
THATCHER WAS COMING.

24:59.271 --> 25:01.540
I WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU.
I-I JUST...

25:01.540 --> 25:03.208
POP'S SAD.

25:03.208 --> 25:06.011
HE'S NOT THE SAME.
I WANT YOU TO FIX IT, UNCLE LOU.

25:06.011 --> 25:08.213
IT'LL ALL WORK OUT, T.J.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

25:08.213 --> 25:10.716
I<i> AM</i> WORRIED.
I'M DAMN WORRIED!

25:10.716 --> 25:13.618
OKAY, GO INSIDE, PLEASE.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.
I...

25:13.618 --> 25:15.053
BYE, AUNT CONNIE.

25:15.053 --> 25:17.322
LET'S TALK OVER HERE,
SON.

25:35.741 --> 25:38.410
DON'T.
I'M SORRY. I...

25:43.315 --> 25:45.917
HEY.

25:45.917 --> 25:46.918
Is this a bad time?

25:46.918 --> 25:50.455
UM... NO, NOT TOO BAD.

25:50.455 --> 25:51.757
YEAH, WE CAN'T FIND THE BOOK

25:51.757 --> 25:53.024
THE MAGIC BEDTIME BOOK.

25:53.024 --> 25:54.192
Yeah.

25:54.192 --> 25:57.028
IT'S THE ONE ABOUT THE GIRAFFE,
AND IT'S ON--

25:57.028 --> 25:58.296
IT'S ON THE SHELF.

25:58.296 --> 26:01.433
OR IF NOT, IT'S ON THE CHAIR
OR--OR BEHIND THE CHAIR

26:01.433 --> 26:04.436
'CAUSE IT ALWAYS FALLS
BEHIND THE CHAIR.

26:04.436 --> 26:06.471
AH, THERE IT IS. I GOT IT.
ALL RIGHT.

26:06.471 --> 26:07.939
OKAY. GOOD.

26:07.939 --> 26:11.843
Mommy? Wait.
Can I talk to Mommy?

26:11.843 --> 26:13.712
YES, BABY.

26:13.712 --> 26:15.480
NIGHT, MOMMY. I LOVE YOU.

26:19.451 --> 26:20.852
LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY.

26:20.852 --> 26:22.020
Bye.

26:41.473 --> 26:46.278
AND IT'S NOT UNTIL THE GIRAFFE
HEARS HIS OWN SONG--

26:46.278 --> 26:48.780
IN THE TREES, IN THE SKY--

26:48.780 --> 26:52.050
THAT HE'S FINALLY ABLE
TO DANCE.

26:53.752 --> 26:55.253
SO IT WASN'T JUST
HIS FREAKISHLY LONG LEGS

26:55.253 --> 26:56.822
THAT WERE THE PROBLEM?

27:02.127 --> 27:03.895
HAVE YOU, UH...

27:03.895 --> 27:06.631
HAVE YOU EVER...

27:06.631 --> 27:08.700
I'VE NEVER EVEN
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

27:21.413 --> 27:24.115
HEY, MAN! IT'S RIGHT THERE!

27:46.056 --> 27:47.524
<i>NORTH CENTRAL LINE SERVICE</i>

27:47.524 --> 27:50.561
<i>TO VERNON HILLS</i>
<i>WITH STOPS AT RIVER GROVE...</i>

27:55.938 --> 27:58.936
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO SEE HIM! YOU IDIOT!

27:58.936 --> 28:00.638
WHY DID YOU GO THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

28:00.638 --> 28:02.840
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO THE CLUB?!

28:02.840 --> 28:03.941
DAMN IT, T.J.!

28:03.941 --> 28:05.442
THATCHER!
HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID?!

28:05.442 --> 28:09.079
TAKE IT EASY.
WHAT HAPPENED?

28:09.079 --> 28:12.282
GO ON. TELL HIM.
<i>TELL HIM!</i>

28:12.282 --> 28:15.853
I WENT TO SEE UNCLE LOU.
I-I WANTED--

28:15.853 --> 28:18.589
OH, SPIT IT OUT.
YOU WANTED TO DO WHAT?

28:18.589 --> 28:20.591
I WANTED TO HELP FIX IT!

28:20.591 --> 28:21.959
IT'S OKAY, T.J.

28:21.959 --> 28:24.261
IT'S OKAY.
NO, JACK, IT'S NOT OKAY.

28:24.261 --> 28:26.930
LOU'S DEAD.

28:26.930 --> 28:29.667
I ASKED IF HE BETRAYED US,
AND HE--HE GOT MAD,

28:29.667 --> 28:30.768
AND HE PUSHED ME.

28:30.768 --> 28:34.004
AND WE FOUGHT.
HE FELL INTO THE WATER,

28:34.004 --> 28:35.773
AND I CLIMBED OUT
AND I PULLED HIM OUT,

28:35.773 --> 28:36.907
AND THEN HE STARTED
YELLING AT ME,

28:36.907 --> 28:39.810
SAYING MEAN THINGS,
AND HE CALLED ME STUPID,

28:39.810 --> 28:41.812
AND HE--HE SAID
I WAS RETARDED.

28:41.812 --> 28:44.448
THE COPS
PULLED LOU OUT OF THE RIVER

28:44.448 --> 28:45.849
WITH TWO BULLETS IN HIM.

28:47.785 --> 28:49.787
WHERE'S THE GUN, T.J.?

28:49.787 --> 28:51.989
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BAD.

28:51.989 --> 28:53.490
GO GET CLEANED UP.

28:53.490 --> 28:56.660
GO ON. GO TO BED.

28:56.660 --> 28:58.328
I JUST WANTED TO HELP...

28:58.328 --> 29:02.466
LIKE YOU DO, JACK.
LIKE A SON'S SUPPOSED TO.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.307
SAY NOTHING...

29:10.307 --> 29:12.409
TO ANYONE.

29:14.244 --> 29:15.879
YOU UNDERSTAND?

29:32.029 --> 29:36.700
NOBODY MUST KNOW THAT
T.J.'s INVOLVED IN THIS, JACK,

29:36.700 --> 29:39.203
NOT EVEN ELAINE.

29:39.203 --> 29:41.505
WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS
ALL GO AWAY.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.511
IF HE GOES TO PRISON...

29:51.148 --> 29:54.118
HE'LL NEVER SURVIVE.

29:54.118 --> 29:56.587
WE CUT A DEAL
ON THE HUTCHERSON CASE,

29:56.587 --> 29:58.155
AND I'VE GOT A STAY
ON MY CORRUPTION HEARING,

29:58.155 --> 29:59.523
SO IF YOU NEED ME TO JUMP IN
AT ALL--

29:59.523 --> 30:00.691
THINK WE'LL BE OKAY.
HEY.

30:00.691 --> 30:03.761
HEY. UH... HONEY.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

30:03.761 --> 30:05.095
SARA, NICE TO SEE YOU.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.096
HEY, LARRY.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.831
COMING TO
THE RETIREMENT PARTY?

30:07.831 --> 30:09.566
WOULDN'T MISS IT.

30:09.566 --> 30:12.302
GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE
TO FIND A HOBBY.

30:13.704 --> 30:15.339
I THOUGHT
WE MIGHT HAVE COFFEE.

30:15.339 --> 30:16.540
CAN'T. I GOT A MEETING,

30:16.540 --> 30:18.809
AND THEN I HAVE AN EARLY LUNCH
WITH THE ALDERMAN,

30:18.809 --> 30:21.044
AND HE WANTS TO DISCUSS
MY POLITICAL FUTURE.

30:21.044 --> 30:23.347
WELL, H-HOW ABOUT NOW?
JUST FOR FIVE MINUTES.

30:23.347 --> 30:26.350
I JUST FEEL BAD THAT I GOT HOME
SO LATE LAST NIGHT.

30:26.350 --> 30:29.019
I WISH THAT I COULD, BABE.
I DO.

30:29.019 --> 30:30.387
I JUST--
EVERYONE'S WAITING,

30:30.387 --> 30:33.056
AND I'LL BE HOME FOR
OLLIE'S BEDTIME, ALL RIGHT?

30:33.056 --> 30:34.057
WE'LL TALK THEN?

30:34.057 --> 30:35.325
OKAY?

31:06.256 --> 31:09.760
CONSTANCE,
I-I'M SO SORRY.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.929
WE ALL ARE.

31:11.929 --> 31:14.631
UH, CAN I, UH,
CAN I COME IN?

31:14.631 --> 31:17.901
UH... M-MY SISTER'S HERE.
I'M...

31:17.901 --> 31:21.038
I'M STILL PROCESSING
EVERYTHING.

31:21.038 --> 31:22.406
OF COURSE.

31:22.406 --> 31:26.777
LOOK, THATCHER WILL TAKE CARE
OF ALL THE FUNERAL EXPENSES

31:26.777 --> 31:28.579
AND WHATEVER YOU NEED.

31:28.579 --> 31:31.982
DID--DID HE SEND YOU HERE
TO TELL ME THAT?

31:31.982 --> 31:33.083
YEAH.

31:33.083 --> 31:37.321
AND ALSO, T.J. SAYS
HE SAW YOU LAST NIGHT.

31:37.321 --> 31:40.757
UH, I'VE
ALWAYS LOVED THAT BOY, JACK.

31:40.757 --> 31:42.025
WE BOTH DID.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.327
I CAN'T IMAGINE HE WOULD--

31:43.327 --> 31:44.862
HE DIDN'T.
I KNOW HE DIDN'T.

31:44.862 --> 31:46.196
BE PATIENT.

31:46.196 --> 31:49.299
I'M SURE THE POLICE WILL FIND
A GUN AND A SUSPECT.

31:49.299 --> 31:51.802
AND IN THE MEANTIME,

31:51.802 --> 31:53.837
LET'S NOT MENTION T.J.,
YOU KNOW?

31:53.837 --> 31:55.939
IT'S ONLY GONNA COMPLICATE
THINGS.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.510
LOU AND I...

32:00.510 --> 32:03.814
WOULD NEVER
TURN ON THIS FAMILY.

32:03.814 --> 32:04.948
NEVER...

32:04.948 --> 32:08.452
UNLESS THEY TURNED ON US
FIRST.

32:08.452 --> 32:10.621
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED,
CONNIE.

32:10.621 --> 32:15.025
IT WAS A BUSINESS SITUATION.
IT WAS GETTING WORKED OUT.

32:15.025 --> 32:18.662
DON'T PUNISH T.J. JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE ANGRY AT THATCHER.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.333
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONDOLENCES.

32:53.864 --> 32:57.334
HEY. I DIDN'T EVEN
HEAR YOU COME IN.

32:57.334 --> 32:59.469
WHAT'S THAT DOING HERE?

33:01.038 --> 33:03.206
YOUR ASSISTANT
MESSENGERED IT OVER.

33:03.206 --> 33:05.876
I WAS THINKING OF HANGING IT
AT THE OFFICE.

33:05.876 --> 33:07.945
IT LOOKS GOOD HERE.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.246
WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I GOT IT FOR.

33:09.246 --> 33:10.447
I GOT IT FOR THE OFFICE,
OKAY?

33:10.447 --> 33:13.383
AND WHY'D YOU HANG IT UP
WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME?

33:15.986 --> 33:17.587
I'M SORRY.

33:20.857 --> 33:22.559
ANY MORE WORD ON LOU?

33:22.559 --> 33:25.362
THEY HAVEN'T
FOUND ANYTHING YET.

33:25.362 --> 33:28.565
NO MURDER WEAPON,
NO SUSPECT, NOTHING.

33:35.939 --> 33:38.976
GOD, WE'RE ALWAYS RUNNING.
RIGHT?

33:38.976 --> 33:40.510
BOTH OF US.

33:42.112 --> 33:43.747
I MISS YOU.

33:46.516 --> 33:47.784
COMING TO BED?

33:47.784 --> 33:50.420
SOON.

33:50.420 --> 33:51.655
OKAY.

34:29.693 --> 34:32.295
BABY, YOU AWAKE?

34:55.272 --> 34:57.007
HELLO?

34:57.007 --> 34:58.509
Sara, it's Jack.

35:12.089 --> 35:14.183
ARE YOU... ALL RIGHT?

35:17.744 --> 35:20.889
MY LIFE--IT'S--
IT'S SO SMALL SOMETIMES,

35:20.889 --> 35:23.491
EVERYTHING IN IT.

35:23.491 --> 35:25.760
BUT WITH YOU...

35:25.760 --> 35:30.098
WITH YOU,
IT STARTED TO FEEL--

35:30.098 --> 35:33.028
THE--I DON'T KNOW THE WORD.

35:33.028 --> 35:34.329
MAGNITUDE.

35:34.329 --> 35:35.767
I...

35:38.017 --> 35:39.786
I STARTED TO FEEL
THE MAGNITUDE OF THINGS

35:39.786 --> 35:42.222
IN A WAY I-I NEVER DID.

35:42.222 --> 35:45.592
I STARTED TO FEEL LIKE
I COULD IMAGINE MY LIFE

35:45.592 --> 35:47.627
NOT THE WAY IT IS BUT...

35:47.627 --> 35:49.596
THE WAY YOU DREAM IT.

35:50.964 --> 35:52.699
THIS--THIS CAN'T HAPPEN.

35:57.937 --> 36:00.373
NO, IT CAN'T.

36:00.373 --> 36:02.909
I JUST COULDN'T LEAVE IT
THE WAY IT WAS AT THE STATION.

36:02.909 --> 36:06.312
IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT.
SO I-I CAME HERE.

36:06.312 --> 36:08.214
I'M--I'M GLAD.

36:08.214 --> 36:11.651
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
IF YOU WERE FEELING LIKE I WAS

36:11.651 --> 36:15.421
OR ANYTHING LIKE IT,
'CAUSE THEN MAYBE--

36:15.421 --> 36:18.691
MAYBE I WOULDN'T FEEL SO...

36:18.691 --> 36:21.193
OUT OF CONTROL AND CRAZY.

36:23.463 --> 36:27.233
YOU KNOW, IT WAS SO GREAT
GETTING TO KNOW YOU,

36:27.233 --> 36:28.821
SPENDING TIME WITH YOU.

36:31.596 --> 36:33.139
I WON'T FORGET IT.

36:38.094 --> 36:39.544
I-I SHOULD GO.

36:43.608 --> 36:45.109
TAKE CARE, OKAY?

37:40.769 --> 37:45.059
<i>HEY, THIS IS SARA.</i>
<i>LEAVE A MESSAGE. THANKS.</i>

37:45.134 --> 37:47.069
Hey, baby. You there? No?

37:47.444 --> 37:49.680
I wanna take you out to dinner
tonight.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.548
Had a good day.
I'll tell you about it later.

37:51.548 --> 37:54.718
Okay. Call me.

37:54.968 --> 37:58.157
I NEED YOU HERE NOW, JACK.
THE COPS JUST SHOWED UP.

37:58.157 --> 38:01.060
I SENT T.J. TO THE CLUB,
BUT I CAN'T STALL THEM FOR LONG.

38:06.823 --> 38:08.859
MR. KARSTEN.
HOW DO YOU DO?

38:08.859 --> 38:10.460
I'M DETECTIVE BIRNBAUM.

38:10.460 --> 38:12.555
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
DETECTIVE CASILLAS.

38:12.555 --> 38:14.057
NICE TO MEET YOU.

38:14.057 --> 38:15.625
PLEASE.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.593
MAY I OFFER YOU A SCOTCH?

38:17.593 --> 38:19.529
DO YOU KNOW WHY
WE'RE HERE, SIR?

38:19.529 --> 38:23.199
I IMAGINE IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH LOU MROZAK.

38:23.199 --> 38:26.069
IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE SHOCK
FOR MY WHOLE FAMILY.

38:26.069 --> 38:29.306
YOUR SON T.J.'s BEEN IDENTIFIED
AS A PERSON OF INTEREST.

38:29.306 --> 38:30.774
AS A SUSPECT?

38:30.774 --> 38:33.043
THAT'S ABSURD.

38:33.043 --> 38:34.444
T.J. LOVED HIS UNCLE.

38:34.444 --> 38:37.080
JUST WANNA TALK TO HIM, SIR.
IS HE HOME?

38:37.080 --> 38:39.382
NOT AT THE MOMENT, NO.

38:39.382 --> 38:41.218
I'M NOT SURE WHERE HE IS.

38:41.218 --> 38:44.221
I SUPPOSE I COULD
TRACK HIM DOWN

38:44.221 --> 38:46.523
IF IT WAS
REALLY NECESSARY.

38:46.523 --> 38:47.758
IT'S NECESSARY.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.945
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE THERE.
EASY, T.J.

38:50.945 --> 38:52.570
I-I SHOULDN'T HAVE.
WHY DID I GO THERE?
JUST TELL ME.

38:52.570 --> 38:53.514
JUST CALM DOWN.

38:53.514 --> 38:55.983
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

38:55.983 --> 38:58.018
WHAT HAPPENED?

38:58.018 --> 39:01.528
I CAN'T SAY. I-I CAN'T.

39:01.528 --> 39:06.133
MNH-MNH. IT'S ME, BABE.
IT'S BRANDY.

39:07.008 --> 39:08.394
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

39:25.912 --> 39:27.346
YOU'RE LATE, MOMMY.

39:27.346 --> 39:29.215
HEY, BABY.

39:29.215 --> 39:31.817
HEY.
OH.

39:31.817 --> 39:34.420
YEAH. I...
WHERE'S JANEY?

39:34.420 --> 39:37.056
SHE LEFT. DAD'S HERE.

39:37.056 --> 39:40.059
HE'S HAPPY.
HE BROUGHT WINE.

39:44.130 --> 39:46.199
HEY.

39:47.667 --> 39:48.734
HEY.

39:49.609 --> 39:50.877
WHERE WERE YOU?

39:50.877 --> 39:52.020
AT MY STUDIO.

39:52.020 --> 39:53.272
THERE WAS NO ANSWER.

39:53.272 --> 39:55.608
OH, I MUST HAVE LEFT
THE RINGER OFF.

39:57.743 --> 40:00.480
OH, YEAH. I EXCHANGED IT.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.881
WENT BACK
AND GOT SOMETHING BETTER.

40:01.881 --> 40:03.049
IT'S NICE, RIGHT?

40:04.750 --> 40:05.952
SOMETHING GOING ON?

40:05.952 --> 40:08.888
YES.

40:08.888 --> 40:10.456
I WAS GOING TO TAKE YOU
OUT TO DINNER.

40:10.456 --> 40:12.425
BUT IT WAS GETTING LATE,
SO I TOLD JANEY TO GO HOME.

40:12.425 --> 40:15.261
WE'LL JUST...
WE'LL CELEBRATE AS A FAMILY.

40:15.261 --> 40:16.496
CELEBRATE WHAT?

40:16.496 --> 40:18.798
THE CASE
THAT IS GONNA GET ME

40:18.798 --> 40:21.434
ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF EVERY PAPER IN ILLINOIS.

40:21.434 --> 40:23.803
I NAIL THIS ONE, I GET BUMPED UP
TO STATE'S ATTORNEY

40:23.803 --> 40:26.339
AFTER ABRAMS RETIRES,
AND THEN WE ARE OFF AND RUNNING.

40:26.339 --> 40:28.574
I MEAN, MAYOR. SENATOR.

40:28.574 --> 40:31.744
OBAMA DID IT.
RAHM EMANUEL DID IT.

40:31.744 --> 40:33.779
WE CAN, TOO.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.781
WHAT KIND OF CASE?

40:35.781 --> 40:37.850
MURDER.

40:37.850 --> 40:40.319
ACTUALLY, INVOLVES
YOUR FAVORITE PHOTO SUBJECT.

40:42.822 --> 40:45.124
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW
FOUND DEAD LAST NIGHT,

40:45.124 --> 40:48.161
FACEDOWN IN THE RIVER,
TWO BULLETS IN HIM.

40:48.161 --> 40:51.497
KARSTEN'S SON
IS THE PRIME SUSPECT.

40:51.497 --> 40:53.784
REALLY? I MET HIM.
HE WAS AT THE GALLERY.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.902
THE KARSTENS--
THEY HAVE TIES

40:55.902 --> 40:57.403

TO BRIBERY,

40:57.403 --> 40:59.798
ORGANIZED CRIME.
IT'S WAY MORE THAN I REALIZED.

41:11.818 --> 41:14.087
WHO'S THIS?

41:16.356 --> 41:17.490
McALLISTER.

41:17.490 --> 41:20.126

HE'S KARSTEN'S IN-HOUSE COUNSEL.

41:20.126 --> 41:21.794
HE'S GONNA BE
THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY AGAINST ME.

41:23.037 --> 41:24.497
I'M GONNA CRUCIFY HIM.

41:24.497 --> 41:25.598
HUH.

41:34.707 --> 41:36.175

41:36.175 --> 41:37.176
GREAT.
