00:40.583 --> 00:42.335
Come on, it wasn't so bad.

00:46.458 --> 00:51.089
- What was that?
- Please remind me, never to go out with you.

00:51.250 --> 00:55.676
- Fine, you don't have to.
- I won't.

00:57.708 --> 01:00.302
Shut up! Stop laughing,
it's not funny.

01:00.458 --> 01:03.257
- Are you okay?
- No.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.878
Stupid shoes.

01:06.292 --> 01:08.886
The fuck are you looking at?

01:09.250 --> 01:12.174
But seriously, I've never seen
so many douchebags in one place.

01:12.292 --> 01:16.092
- I don't know, that tall one was kinda hot.
- The Marilyn Manson?

01:16.250 --> 01:18.127
- Hot!
- Gross!

01:19.250 --> 01:21.423
- You take this, I'll take the next one.
- You little freak.

01:21.583 --> 01:24.257
- You're gonna go back in there, aren't you?
- Huh, no.

01:24.458 --> 01:26.256
- Whatever.
- No.

01:26.375 --> 01:29.299
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Stephanie.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.462
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You look so pretty.

01:37.625 --> 01:40.708
- I had to just to scare you a little bit.
- Don't touch me.

01:40.917 --> 01:43.215
I'm just trying to say hello,
you have such a pretty dress on.

01:43.333 --> 01:47.213
Check it out, check it out...
We got a limo, we got weed, champagne.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.506
<i>Just come hang with us.
Leave her alone.</i>

01:50.167 --> 01:51.919
Why are you in a such a bad mood?

01:52.083 --> 01:55.007
Can I have a cigarette at least?
Or something, a smile?

01:55.167 --> 01:56.885
Fuck off.

01:57.958 --> 02:00.006
She just threw a cigarette at me.

02:00.167 --> 02:02.135
Bad vibe, bro.

02:02.667 --> 02:05.011
- Not very nice.
- Not very nice.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.419
Hi! Can you-

02:15.292 --> 02:16.965
The fuck?!

02:19.417 --> 02:22.011
<i>I see you too.</i>

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.167 --> 02:37.545
That late and still out?

02:37.833 --> 02:41.258
Better go home.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.510
Oh, fuck.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.340
<i>Okay.</i>

02:55.958 --> 02:58.552
<i>I know where you live, Judy.</i>

02:59.625 --> 03:01.627
<i>See you later.</i>

04:41.833 --> 04:44.256
Yeah, I just got home.

04:46.458 --> 04:49.052
God, I'm glad that's over.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.293
I know.

05:02.625 --> 05:05.674
It was just some old truck driver.

05:06.292 --> 05:08.010
Yeah.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.594
Ugh no, I didn't.
I just...

05:11.292 --> 05:14.341
No, it freaked me out.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.298
I know.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.503
Yeah well, I blame you.

05:19.792 --> 05:22.420
The stupid places you take me to.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.335
Oh crap.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.465
The lights are out on my floor.

05:30.917 --> 05:32.635
Ok, bye.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.628
- Where'd you park the car?
- It's downstairs.

05:42.833 --> 05:46.258
- You got the address?
- Yeah. You better hurry, we're gonna be late.

06:19.542 --> 06:21.419
Please don't scream.

06:21.583 --> 06:24.086
You're so beautiful.

06:54.042 --> 07:01.176
<b>MANIAC</b>

07:51.125 --> 07:53.469
Hello, Redlucie86.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.257
<i>Truly timid?</i>

08:00.583 --> 08:02.927
It's my first time on a dating site.

08:13.583 --> 08:17.417
There's a reason
I'm called timid man.

08:23.667 --> 08:25.669
Picture...

09:16.458 --> 09:19.428
That sounds lovely.

09:19.583 --> 09:22.302
Why didn't you agree?

09:22.542 --> 09:24.670
Of course I have.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.177
- Lucie?
- Frank.

09:29.292 --> 09:32.171
- Hi.
- Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

09:32.292 --> 09:34.715
No charm, I'm sure.

09:37.833 --> 09:42.259
- You are totally not what I imagined.
- Really? What did you imagine?

09:43.208 --> 09:46.838
Umm, like fat, with long black hair

09:47.000 --> 09:50.300
and just greasy skin full of acne.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.385
Huh, you should've seen the other photo
I was going to send you.

09:52.542 --> 09:56.092
I mean people always post
the best pictures of themselves

09:56.250 --> 09:59.049
and then that's what something
is like when you meet them.

09:59.458 --> 10:02.302
I ordered some wine.
I hope you don't mind.

10:02.417 --> 10:05.091
No, I like a man
who takes control.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.343
Thank you.

10:13.542 --> 10:15.385
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.383
So, how long have you been using
the website?

10:19.542 --> 10:21.636
Uhh, like six months, maybe?

10:21.833 --> 10:24.461
But this is my first dinner date,
usually it's just for drinks.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.048
Although I can already tell that
you are a breath of fresh air

10:27.208 --> 10:29.802
for the jugheads I deal
with at the bar every night, ugh.

10:29.958 --> 10:34.134
See, it's really easy to get over
with the testosterone at work, you know?

10:34.292 --> 10:36.010
Yeah.

10:41.917 --> 10:44.841
So, why don't you have
a girlfriend?

10:47.167 --> 10:49.090
- I...
- Are you okay?

10:49.250 --> 10:51.594
I just...

11:07.458 --> 11:10.052
Frank, are you okay?

11:12.208 --> 11:14.631
You look pale.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.423
Is everything okay?

11:21.500 --> 11:23.298
Well, excuse me, I-

11:23.458 --> 11:26.007
I need to find the restroom.

12:02.417 --> 12:06.547
Did that waiter even look Indian to you?
I think he looked more Mexican.

12:08.792 --> 12:11.045
He was such a tool.

12:13.208 --> 12:15.006
You know, it was really sweet
of you to drive me home.

12:16.292 --> 12:18.294
I'm happy to do it.

12:19.667 --> 12:22.216
I had a very lovely evening.

12:23.083 --> 12:26.917
Did you wanna come up
for a drink?

12:27.458 --> 12:28.630
Are you sure?

12:29.250 --> 12:33.209
Uh, like I said -
begging really isn't my thing, so...

12:33.333 --> 12:35.927
Right. Okay then.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.547
Sounds nice.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.801
So what's all that stuff
back there?

12:41.042 --> 12:43.545
I thought you were a journalist
or something.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.836
It's for a fashion shoot.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.298
I'm just doing a favor
for a friend.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.548
So where do you live, Frank?

12:52.042 --> 12:55.296
Probably in some trendy loft
or something.

12:55.458 --> 12:58.382
I mean my place isn't much
but it's all mine, so...

12:58.542 --> 13:00.465
I'm done with roommates.

13:00.917 --> 13:04.091
No, thank you.
I still have to drive home.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.585
Yeah, but not now, right?

13:06.792 --> 13:10.342
You should take off your coat
and stay for a little while.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.552
Want me to put on some music?

13:22.125 --> 13:25.254
I love this song.
Dance with me.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.131
I think you're cute.

13:35.583 --> 13:38.883
I'm gonna be right back.
You don't go anywhere.

13:59.833 --> 14:02.052
You take a lot
of pictures of yourself.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.468
Hi...

14:14.417 --> 14:17.591
I wanted to slip into something
a little more comfortable.

14:22.042 --> 14:24.386
So how about that coat?

14:30.875 --> 14:33.344
Now it's your turn to do me.

14:46.125 --> 14:49.004
Why... Why are you hiding?

14:49.167 --> 14:50.840
I don't know.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.502
They're little.

14:55.292 --> 14:58.296
What do you think?
You wanna touch them?

14:58.500 --> 15:01.583
You shouldn't be so scared,
timid man.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.923
Your hands feel warm.

15:06.708 --> 15:08.255
Squeeze them.

15:12.208 --> 15:14.006
You can do it harder.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.253
You wanna get rough playing?

15:22.375 --> 15:24.924
Is that what you're into?

15:26.250 --> 15:28.548
Are you gonna fuck me?

15:30.292 --> 15:32.795
I can't. I can't.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.256
Don't be a pussy.

15:45.958 --> 15:48.131
You like it?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.334
I like to keep the lights on too.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.174
Don't be so horrified.

16:03.292 --> 16:05.545
You just relax.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.094
Why can't you leave them alone?

17:26.666 --> 17:30.217
Why can't you leave any
of them alone?

17:31.542 --> 17:33.510
Can I have just one

17:33.667 --> 17:36.216
without you getting in the way?

17:36.375 --> 17:37.968
Now look...

17:38.125 --> 17:40.344
Look what you made me do.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.128
Look what you made me do!

17:44.042 --> 17:47.797
I hate you.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.169
I hate you.

17:50.292 --> 17:52.920
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.006
I'll make it better.

17:55.167 --> 17:57.716
I'll make it all better now.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.378
Sorry I missed you today.

19:25.667 --> 19:28.341
I have a surprise for you.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.719
Are you asleep already?

19:35.917 --> 19:39.091
I'm sorry but I just can't wait.

19:40.083 --> 19:41.676
Alright.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.627
Take a look.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.378
I saved the best for last.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.798
Here we go.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.594
Oh, that's nice.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.211
Perfect fit, right?

20:13.750 --> 20:16.879
Okay now, this might
sting a little.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.381
Okay, good.

20:21.042 --> 20:22.715
Good.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.801
Just one more...

20:27.500 --> 20:28.968
Perfect.

20:29.458 --> 20:30.926
Perfect.

20:32.292 --> 20:34.044
Meet Redlucie86.

20:34.250 --> 20:37.254
Redlucie 86,
this is my girlfriend.

20:37.583 --> 20:40.211
I know the two of you will
get along just fine.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.673
Don't worry.

20:44.792 --> 20:47.511
It's fine, it's fine.

20:48.708 --> 20:51.427
What?
She's beautiful.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.590
Why are you ignoring me, huh?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.252
No, wait...

20:58.708 --> 21:00.301
This is impossible.

21:00.542 --> 21:01.759
No!

21:02.500 --> 21:04.548
Why are you doing this to me?

21:04.917 --> 21:06.669
What? You too?

21:07.208 --> 21:08.676
Why?

21:12.750 --> 21:16.505
You're just like her!
You two are the same thing as her!

21:17.708 --> 21:19.506
Why are you doing this?

21:19.750 --> 21:21.502
Why?

24:01.083 --> 24:02.505
Hey.

24:03.333 --> 24:05.335
I'm sorry to disturb you, uhm...

24:05.500 --> 24:09.300
I was just taking pictures
of your mannequins in the window.

24:09.542 --> 24:11.465
I hope that's okay?

24:11.750 --> 24:13.752
- It's fine, I guess.
- Yeah?

24:14.083 --> 24:17.633
Do you mind if I take pictures of them
with the gate open?

24:17.833 --> 24:19.631
Okay, sure.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.424
Yeah? Cool, thank you.

24:24.042 --> 24:28.172
- What's this for?
- Oh, it's just fine art, I guess.

24:30.542 --> 24:32.089
Here, take a look.

24:32.292 --> 24:34.545
- Is that French? Your accent?
- Oui.

24:34.667 --> 24:36.840
You have a good ear.

24:39.708 --> 24:43.963
- What do you do exactly?
- I take pictures of mannequins.

24:44.292 --> 24:47.796
I try to bring them
to life with light.

24:51.667 --> 24:53.715
Okay, cool. Thank you.

24:54.958 --> 24:57.256
Sorry to have disturbed you.

24:57.417 --> 24:59.511
I'm not usually opened on weekends.

24:59.667 --> 25:02.466
Well, thank you
for opening up for me.

25:02.625 --> 25:03.922
Bye.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.085
Would you like to see my work?

25:08.417 --> 25:10.215
What do you do?

25:10.750 --> 25:12.423
Are you an artist?

25:12.583 --> 25:14.256
I don't know about all that.

25:14.917 --> 25:17.670
Come in, maybe you can tell me.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.627
It's amazing.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.344
They're from all styles and eras.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.049
I've restored most of them myself.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.715
She's beautiful.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.335
I love her.

26:01.917 --> 26:04.841
- What year is this from?
- Thirties.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.628
She's in great condition.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.169
You know what...

26:12.333 --> 26:16.088
I'm having a show for my photos
in a gallery downtown.

26:16.833 --> 26:20.383
Maybe I could use some of your
mannequins for my photoshoot.

26:20.875 --> 26:23.503
That would be incredible, I mean...

26:24.167 --> 26:27.797
They're so much more unique than
the ones I've been shooting with.

26:28.708 --> 26:30.836
- Is this your place?
- Yes.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.924
- You bought it?
- It was my family's.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.882
Been restoring them
for three generations.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.465
Who's Angela?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.253
The name on the sign.

26:48.500 --> 26:52.050
It was my mother.
She gone.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.256
I'm sorry.

27:00.542 --> 27:03.716
- Do you live here?
- Thank you for coming.

27:05.042 --> 27:07.420
Sorry, I'm a little nosey.

27:07.583 --> 27:10.757
I mean this place is so special.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.795
So what do you think
if I rent them?

27:16.958 --> 27:18.926
Uh, I'm not sure...

27:19.083 --> 27:21.711
I usually try to find permanent
homes for them.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.386
You're funny.

27:25.667 --> 27:27.920
Well, I can adopt them.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.085
What about that?

27:32.375 --> 27:34.423
I'll give you my number.

27:38.083 --> 27:43.169
So if you change your mind,
I promise to have them home before midnight.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.174
I can be a good mother.

27:52.375 --> 27:54.798
- My name's Anna.
- Thank you.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.923
Call me, please.

28:02.792 --> 28:04.715
Oh and by the way...

28:05.500 --> 28:07.844
You have lipstick on your face.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.673
Have a great day.

28:43.375 --> 28:45.673
Oh no. No, no, no.

28:45.833 --> 28:47.756
No. Get out.

28:47.958 --> 28:49.585
Get out.

28:57.417 --> 28:58.669
Get out.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.631
Get out. Go.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.589
Go.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.468
That's disgusting.

31:13.250 --> 31:15.423
- Move it!
- I'm just waiting for my wife.

31:15.583 --> 31:18.462
You have ten seconds
before I give you a sanitation.

31:18.625 --> 31:20.969
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

33:09.375 --> 33:11.548
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

33:11.667 --> 33:13.669
I got my stuff.

33:14.042 --> 33:16.295
Ugh, can you turn this on?

34:12.667 --> 34:14.635
- I'm sorry!
- Shit, you scared me!

34:14.750 --> 34:16.627
I forgot my tights.

34:17.833 --> 34:20.552
- Hey, do you mind waiting for me, please?
- Sure, yeah.

34:20.667 --> 34:21.839
Thanks.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.878
I can't believe you shoved me in my locker.

34:25.042 --> 34:26.715
Don't be tight.

34:26.875 --> 34:29.047
- It was just a joke.
- Come on...

34:30.125 --> 34:31.877
I could've broke my ankle.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.378
- It still hurts.
- You're such a prick.

34:34.625 --> 34:37.708
- But seriously.
- Tough it up.

34:40.083 --> 34:43.542
- Come on girl, just come out with us.
- One drink.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.301
- No.
- Come on, hun.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.003
- Why don't you wanna come out?
- I'm going home.

34:48.167 --> 34:50.795
- You never come out with us.
- What's up with that?

34:50.917 --> 34:52.385
- The car's right up there.
- No way.

34:55.958 --> 34:59.087
- You guys, I think I really hurt
my leg bad today. - Really?

34:59.250 --> 35:01.594
- How?
- I went so fast with that twitch at.

35:01.750 --> 35:03.127
I really don't think those tights
are any better.

35:04.458 --> 35:06.210
- Good night, girls.
- Good night.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.419
- Get home safe.
- Bye.

35:08.583 --> 35:11.587
Text me, let me know.
Good night.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.676
Oh, fuck.

36:36.875 --> 36:39.298
- You're so beautiful.
- Shit.

36:42.542 --> 36:43.839
Oh, shit.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.218
What the fuck?!

36:58.750 --> 37:00.844
Leave me the fuck alone!

37:05.667 --> 37:07.669
Get away from me.

37:09.250 --> 37:11.218
Somebody! Help me!

37:13.375 --> 37:15.252
What the fuck?
Where is everyone?

37:15.458 --> 37:17.301
Please, help me!

37:28.000 --> 37:30.173
Please! Help me.

37:47.583 --> 37:49.210
Help me!

37:53.458 --> 37:56.632
Somebody! Open it!

37:57.792 --> 37:59.294
Please!

38:00.500 --> 38:01.922
Hey!

38:08.167 --> 38:09.885
Please.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.590
Open the gate, come on!

38:46.583 --> 38:47.960
Oh fuck.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.752
No, no.

38:49.875 --> 38:52.048
Shit.
Oh, shit.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.676
Fuck!

38:57.208 --> 38:59.051
Oh, fuck.

39:11.833 --> 39:13.835
No! No!

39:21.583 --> 39:23.176
Please!

39:23.375 --> 39:25.048
No!

39:25.667 --> 39:27.544
Please.

39:32.250 --> 39:33.877
No!

39:35.833 --> 39:37.380
No!

40:40.667 --> 40:43.671
Stop looking at me,
focus on your work.

40:43.958 --> 40:47.963
- Anna, can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure. What do you need?

40:48.208 --> 40:50.836
A hand, behind you.

40:52.833 --> 40:54.927
- Which one?
- Second row.

40:55.083 --> 40:57.552
- This one?
- The one on the right.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.301
Oh, sorry.

41:05.500 --> 41:08.003
Doctor Frankenstein, I presume.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.386
- Are you a fan of those old films?
- For sure.

41:11.708 --> 41:13.460
Okay, so what do you think
about my idea

41:13.625 --> 41:16.708
of putting the mannequins among
the guests at the show?

41:17.542 --> 41:19.886
You could see them mingling,
like they're real people.

41:20.042 --> 41:23.876
Sometimes I think they have
more personality than most people.

41:26.375 --> 41:29.128
I think we may have some
of the same friends.

41:35.083 --> 41:38.713
- So, what do you think?
- I think you're incredibly talented.

41:38.875 --> 41:41.924
- Well, that makes two of us then.
- Not really.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.053
- I'm just a restorer.
- That one's my favorite.

41:46.083 --> 41:48.711
Okay, now you show me.

41:57.458 --> 41:59.256
It's amazing.

41:59.583 --> 42:03.042
- It's gonna be perfect, Frank.
- I'm glad you like them.

42:03.208 --> 42:05.927
- I love them.
- Why did you want them to be faceless?

42:06.542 --> 42:10.217
Oh, I have a little idea for the show.
You'll see.

42:11.208 --> 42:14.132
Okay, I'm starving. Are you hungry?
You wanna grab some lunch with me?

42:16.208 --> 42:19.542
It's my third exhibition since
I've graduated from art center.

42:19.792 --> 42:21.886
But it's my first with this gallery.

42:22.292 --> 42:26.593
If it's successful they'll give me a show
in their other galleries in New York.

42:27.125 --> 42:31.050
If something was missing...
Something tangible relating to the concept-

42:31.250 --> 42:35.084
The installation of your mannequins
with create the ambiance I was looking for.

42:35.250 --> 42:37.878
You know, when you came into my shop
you looked at them

42:38.042 --> 42:39.885
like noone else ever did.

42:40.167 --> 42:41.589
You seem captivated.

42:41.750 --> 42:44.219
- You must have thought I was crazy.
- No.

42:44.417 --> 42:47.796
You were so soulful with them.
So present.

42:48.708 --> 42:51.882
When my mother died last summer,
I wasn't so sure what to do with our shop.

42:52.042 --> 42:56.252
Most stores couldn't care less about restoring antiques.
It's cheaper to buy them new.

42:56.458 --> 42:58.927
And if I closed the shop
I would've had to abandon them.

42:59.083 --> 43:02.292
It's like me and my old negatives.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.844
I have boxes full of them but I could
never see myself getting rid of them.

43:04.958 --> 43:07.131
Sometimes it's hard to move on.

43:10.042 --> 43:12.465
So what does your girlfriend
think of your work?

43:13.500 --> 43:17.630
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Really? Okay...

43:17.875 --> 43:20.173
I thought you lived with someone.

43:22.125 --> 43:23.877
Frank?

43:24.208 --> 43:27.792
- Are you okay? - It's nothing.
It's just a migraine. It'll pass.

43:27.917 --> 43:31.592
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, no, no- I'll be fine.

43:31.750 --> 43:34.879
I just need my meds.
I'm used to it.

43:35.583 --> 43:39.167
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Are you sure you don't need help here?

43:39.375 --> 43:42.094
No, thanks.
I just need to be alone.

43:57.167 --> 43:59.010
Watch it, fuck face.

44:00.500 --> 44:01.877
Are you suffering from a migraine?

44:02.500 --> 44:05.800
This will have a similar effect
but you won't need a prescription for it.

44:05.917 --> 44:09.217
- And it comes in a nasal spray, so it'll work faster.
- Thank you.

44:45.792 --> 44:49.296
<i>We have found links connecting
the two victims in mid-town.</i>

44:49.500 --> 44:51.673
<i>But as our investigation
is still developing</i>

44:51.833 --> 44:54.256
<i>I can not give you
any more details.</i>

44:54.458 --> 44:57.462
<i>All I can say is that all
of these women were caucasian,</i>

44:57.625 --> 45:00.504
between the ages of 20-30.

45:00.750 --> 45:02.798
They can talk all they want.

45:02.917 --> 45:05.011
But they will never understand.

45:05.167 --> 45:07.511
As long as you keep a secret.

45:07.792 --> 45:11.001
But if you can't, it'll find you...

45:11.167 --> 45:13.135
and you'll be alone.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.093
You hear that?!

45:15.292 --> 45:16.760
The lot of you.

45:16.875 --> 45:18.627
Alone.

45:23.042 --> 45:26.046
- Now promise me you won't tell.
- Franky?!

45:26.250 --> 45:28.048
Hey, it's mommy.

45:28.458 --> 45:30.586
Franky, honey, where are you?

45:33.875 --> 45:35.548
Franky!

46:09.833 --> 46:11.631
Come here.

46:38.083 --> 46:40.427
Shh, momma loves you.

47:29.083 --> 47:30.881
Hey.

47:31.417 --> 47:34.170
The necklace is beautiful, Frank.
Thank you so much.

47:34.458 --> 47:36.927
- Did you make it?
- I did.

47:37.292 --> 47:38.839
That's original.

47:39.042 --> 47:40.885
Where did you get the stone?

47:41.000 --> 47:42.877
It's something I found
in a thrift store.

47:43.042 --> 47:45.761
Is that real hair?
What is it?

47:45.875 --> 47:49.049
- I believe it's horse hair.
- That's interesting.

47:49.917 --> 47:52.261
And what about you?
Are you feeling better?

47:52.458 --> 47:56.634
Oh, sure.
I've had migraines since I was a kid.

47:56.792 --> 47:59.215
I forgot to take my medicine, so...

47:59.417 --> 48:02.796
It's really nothing.
Sorry if I've frightened you.

48:02.917 --> 48:05.636
- It's okay.
- I just finished on-

48:09.958 --> 48:13.963
Um, you know- Sometimes I feel like
you come from another era.

48:14.167 --> 48:16.670
I love it.
It makes you very different.

48:17.417 --> 48:19.715
One second, Frank.
I'm sorry.

48:19.875 --> 48:21.798
Thank you so much.

48:22.208 --> 48:23.630
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

48:23.792 --> 48:28.172
Sorry Frank, a friend of mine
was helping me and I had to say goodbye.

48:30.708 --> 48:34.383
I sometimes feel like
a slave-driver, you know?

48:35.292 --> 48:38.262
- I hate it.
- I can't say I know what you mean.

48:38.708 --> 48:40.631
I've always worked alone.

48:41.875 --> 48:44.924
- You never feel lonely?
- Yeah.

48:45.375 --> 48:47.798
That's why I was calling.

48:47.917 --> 48:50.136
I thought if you weren't
doing anything...

48:50.292 --> 48:51.544
I would love to.

48:51.792 --> 48:53.920
But I have so much to do tonight.

48:54.083 --> 48:56.632
But what about tomorrow?
We could do something.

48:56.792 --> 48:59.636
Okay, yeah.
Tomorrow night works.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.469
- What time?
- Nine?

49:03.625 --> 49:06.754
- Is that okay?
- Nine is perfect.

49:06.875 --> 49:10.175
- I'll pick you up at the gallery?
- Yeah, super.

49:10.417 --> 49:11.885
Cool.

49:12.375 --> 49:13.797
Good night, Frank.

49:13.917 --> 49:15.590
Good night, Anna.

49:56.292 --> 49:59.262
Stop staring.
You're missing a movie.

50:10.875 --> 50:13.924
Franky? Hey, it's mommy.
Franky?

50:14.167 --> 50:16.420
Franky, honey, where are you?

50:18.042 --> 50:19.840
Franky?

50:41.625 --> 50:43.298
Are you alright?

50:44.375 --> 50:46.048
Yeah, yeah.

50:46.292 --> 50:48.044
I'm fine.

50:55.167 --> 50:56.794
So what'd you think?

50:56.917 --> 51:00.876
<i>You know, Caligari is -
to be the first horror movie.</i>

51:01.708 --> 51:04.336
I really thought she was gonna
get killed at the end.

51:04.500 --> 51:06.093
I'm glad that she didn't.

51:06.292 --> 51:09.922
Yeah, but they all end up living
in a mental hospital.

51:10.083 --> 51:13.337
I know but at least
it was a happy ending.

51:14.708 --> 51:18.713
I may have just found
the last romantic.

51:19.375 --> 51:21.173
Sorry.

51:23.958 --> 51:25.460
Hello?

51:25.625 --> 51:26.922
Yeah.

51:27.792 --> 51:29.715
Where are you?

51:30.458 --> 51:32.586
Yeah, okay. Cool.

51:32.750 --> 51:34.593
Yeah, I would love to.

51:35.917 --> 51:39.000
Okay, I'll call you back
in five minutes. Ciao.

51:41.125 --> 51:44.095
It's my boyfriend.
He's at a bar having a drink.

51:44.292 --> 51:46.465
You wanna have a drink with him?

51:47.458 --> 51:50.428
Frank?
Are you okay?

51:50.583 --> 51:53.336
- It's okay. I'm tired.
- Are you having another migraine?

51:53.500 --> 51:55.502
No, I'm fine.

51:55.667 --> 51:57.761
I just have some more work
I have to do at the shop.

51:57.875 --> 51:59.798
Have fun, though.

52:00.458 --> 52:02.301
- Let's have one drink.
- No.

52:02.458 --> 52:03.801
- Just one.
- Really.

52:03.917 --> 52:05.419
Come on.

52:06.750 --> 52:09.299
- I had a very nice evening.
- Okay.

52:19.758 --> 52:21.444
Another time, I guess.

52:21.479 --> 52:23.131
Good night, Frank.

52:27.958 --> 52:29.585
Goodbye, Anna.

52:29.792 --> 52:32.466
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

53:10.542 --> 53:13.091
Go wait for me in the car, Franky.

53:15.833 --> 53:18.302
Don't just stand there.

53:18.917 --> 53:20.669
Do as I tell you!

53:29.083 --> 53:31.506
Go wait for me in the car,
goddamm it. Franky!

54:41.542 --> 54:44.796
- Hey guys.
- Hey. Good show.

54:44.917 --> 54:46.590
- Do you think?
- Absolutely.

54:46.750 --> 54:48.423
- Really?
- It's great.

54:53.917 --> 54:56.045
Are you serious?

54:59.375 --> 55:01.002
One second.

55:04.750 --> 55:07.674
- Hey Frank, I'm so happy to see you.
- Hello Anna.

55:07.792 --> 55:09.635
- You look stunning.
- Thank you.

55:09.792 --> 55:11.965
- Really, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

55:12.208 --> 55:15.337
I just feel like I'm in
a carnival costume.

55:15.500 --> 55:18.754
This heels make me walk
like an ostrich.

55:21.292 --> 55:24.171
- I'm happy you made it, though.
- Me too.

55:24.458 --> 55:28.088
- Your photos are breathtaking.
- Thank you.

55:28.625 --> 55:32.175
The way you made the mannequins
come to life at the projections.

55:32.500 --> 55:34.343
- Yeah.
- It's you, right?

55:34.500 --> 55:36.377
Yeah, it's me.

55:37.542 --> 55:39.886
My face on your mannequins.

55:46.583 --> 55:49.883
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Yeah, sure.

56:13.375 --> 56:15.218
You lose something?

56:16.958 --> 56:20.417
Anna loves to hang out
with her gay friends.

56:20.583 --> 56:25.009
I guess it's a way for a man never have to
worry about trying to fuck her.

56:29.958 --> 56:32.302
You're the mannequin guy, right?

56:32.458 --> 56:34.051
Lemme ask you something.

56:34.208 --> 56:37.132
Did you play with dolls
when you were a kid?

56:38.000 --> 56:40.378
- I'm not gay.
- What?

56:49.792 --> 56:51.669
Good talk.

56:59.583 --> 57:01.176
<i>A famous person once said:</i>

57:01.375 --> 57:03.628
<i>An artist is somebody
who produces things,</i>

57:03.792 --> 57:05.510
<i>that people don't need.</i>

57:07.042 --> 57:08.794
You know...

57:09.542 --> 57:12.716
Your work might interest
another client of mine,

57:12.833 --> 57:18.419
whose general theme is destruction
of completely useless objects.

57:18.583 --> 57:21.712
I'm sure he'd love to smash up
some of your mannequins

57:21.833 --> 57:23.835
at his next photoshoot.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.968
I'm in restoration.

57:26.958 --> 57:28.631
So tell me, Fred-

57:28.792 --> 57:31.921
How does the restoration
process take place?

57:32.083 --> 57:35.758
Do you go dumpster diving,
department stores garbage bins

57:35.958 --> 57:37.881
in search of used parts?

57:38.042 --> 57:41.546
They're antiques.
You wouldn't find them in dumpsters.

57:41.708 --> 57:44.917
Honestly, I just find
the whole thing really creepy.

57:45.083 --> 57:47.586
You and Anna are the perfect fit.

57:47.750 --> 57:50.128
- Do you have a card?
- No.

57:50.500 --> 57:53.959
- Let me see if I have a pen.
- Dominique!

57:54.167 --> 57:56.636
Gorgeous!

58:02.958 --> 58:04.960
- Any buyers?
- A few offers.

58:05.125 --> 58:08.299
But don't worry, the real money's
in New York. Okay?

58:10.125 --> 58:13.584
- Okay, should I call you a cab?
- No, I don't live far. I think I'll walk.

58:13.750 --> 58:17.550
- I can call you a cab.
- No, no, no. You go have fun, fun, fun.

58:17.708 --> 58:19.381
- Okay.
- And congratulations.

58:19.542 --> 58:21.544
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Bye, sweetheart.

58:21.792 --> 58:23.920
- What's wrong with you?
- I guess I...

58:24.458 --> 58:27.177
Why do you always
have to do this?

59:24.042 --> 59:27.421
- Welcome back.
- It's nice to see you.

59:27.583 --> 59:29.460
- Hey Jimmy. Have you been good?
- Excellent.

01:02:37.208 --> 01:02:40.462
Changing your makeup
and hair style didn't fool me.

01:02:44.042 --> 01:02:46.761
You didn't think I'd recognize you?

01:02:47.042 --> 01:02:48.669
Why?

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.719
Cause you think I'm stupid?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.674
Why do you act like
I don't exist?

01:02:59.958 --> 01:03:02.427
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:06.006
But you made me.

01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:08.210
Didn't you?

01:03:08.792 --> 01:03:10.169
Yes.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:16.968
Yes, you did.

01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:30.011
Did you need to be
with all of them? Huh?

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:33.130
Did you?

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.298
Was it the money?

01:03:40.958 --> 01:03:42.801
Answer me!

01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:48.011
You knew, they didn't love you.

01:03:52.042 --> 01:03:54.170
Not like I loved you.

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:58.176
Not like me.

01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:02.461
I still love you.

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:04.673
You know that?

01:04:20.167 --> 01:04:22.420
Please don't kill me.

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:26.334
- Please don't kill me.
- Oh. I'm not gonna kill you.

01:04:27.542 --> 01:04:29.795
I'm gonna keep you.

01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:35.627
Mommy.

01:04:46.667 --> 01:04:50.217
You will not go out tonight.
Is that clear?

01:04:50.417 --> 01:04:53.136
You will stay home with me.

01:05:26.375 --> 01:05:30.676
Hey, it's Anna.
Leave a message after the tone.

01:05:31.792 --> 01:05:33.965
Hi Anna. It's Frank.

01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:36.256
I'm sorry to bother you
at this hour.

01:05:36.375 --> 01:05:39.549
I just wanted to know how long
you wanted to keep the mannequins.

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:41.961
I have another client...

01:05:45.292 --> 01:05:48.136
Anna? What's wrong?
Are you okay?

01:05:48.875 --> 01:05:50.923
Rita, my agent...

01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:53.211
She was murdered last night
in her apartment.

01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:56.094
Murdered?
Oh my god.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:59.629
Police just called me,
asking me so many questions.

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:03.425
Someone broke into her place.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.548
They must have been
waiting for her.

01:06:06.708 --> 01:06:09.336
Frank, it's awful.

01:06:09.458 --> 01:06:12.712
I can't believe it.
I swear it's a nightmare.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.925
You shouldn't be alone now.
Is your boyfriend with you?

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:21.042
No. He's back in New York already.

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:23.210
Do you need company?

01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:27.005
- No, it's okay.
- No, don't be silly.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:31.092
It's no bother.
That's what friends are for, right?

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:35.426
- I don't wanna trouble you with this.
- Anna, I'll be there in 30 minutes.

01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:55.044
I know.

01:06:55.292 --> 01:06:58.421
Me too.
I miss her too.

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.502
It's been a long time.

01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:04.750
I'm gonna get her back.
I promise.

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.801
Come in.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.965
I didn't hear the intercom.

01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:30.628
One of your neighbors
was walking out when I got here.

01:07:30.792 --> 01:07:34.797
I saw your name on the mailbox.
I hope you don't mind.

01:07:35.667 --> 01:07:37.965
I'm happy to see you.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.878
Oh, I didn't know you had company.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:48.252
I don't mean to intrude.

01:07:49.292 --> 01:07:51.545
Martin lives next door.

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:54.719
- Did you guys not meet at the show?
- No but I've heard a lot about you.

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:58.626
- Martin Nunez.
- Frank.

01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:06.219
He's a stylist.
He's helping me with the mannequins.

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:08.048
Yes but I'm really an actor.

01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:10.711
I actually just booked
my first national, so...

01:08:10.917 --> 01:08:12.715
I don't know what that means.

01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:16.381
It's a national commercial.
For Sparkle toothpaste.

01:08:16.542 --> 01:08:18.510
See
- Ding!

01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:22.594
Alright well...
I'm gonna leave you guys.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:25.674
I actually have an audition
first thing in the morning.

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:28.048
So, if you'll excuse me...

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:33.879
- Oh honey. It's gonna be fine.
- Thank you.

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:37.173
Take good care of her, Frank.

01:08:37.957 --> 01:08:39.380
See you.

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:45.756
It must've been
a very long day for you.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:52.545
I know what it feels
like to lose someone.

01:08:52.707 --> 01:08:54.756
I'm here for you, Anna.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.049
Why would your boyfriend leave
for New York now?

01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:05.627
Oh, we got into such
a fight after the show.

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:07.886
It's always about him and...

01:09:08.332 --> 01:09:11.667
I don't even know what I was thinking
hooking up with that guy.

01:09:11.875 --> 01:09:15.004
Really. He's such a music guy.

01:09:15.207 --> 01:09:17.336
Huh, they can be very pompous.

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:19.627
Yeah.

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:25.011
I'm gonna make us coffee, okay?

01:09:28.042 --> 01:09:30.386
That was the first day we met.

01:09:38.125 --> 01:09:40.502
I didn't take care of her.

01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:48.126
I was too busy talking to other people
and she left by herself.

01:09:49.167 --> 01:09:51.261
Don't blame yourself.

01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:53.752
It's really not your fault.

01:10:03.375 --> 01:10:05.798
Just try to let go.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.298
I know what you need.

01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:15.385
I'm so tense.

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:54.884
You know, hair is the only part
of the body that lasts forever.

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:56.794
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:10:57.375 --> 01:11:00.379
- I should've sent her home.
- Anna.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.673
She knew what she was doing.

01:11:02.875 --> 01:11:04.969
She lived three blocks away.

01:11:05.125 --> 01:11:07.719
What were the chances
of her getting attacked?

01:11:10.417 --> 01:11:13.466
Other girls were killed
and you had nothing to do with them.

01:11:13.625 --> 01:11:16.344
Believe me, it's not your fault.

01:11:19.417 --> 01:11:23.627
I asked Rita needed a ride
and that's when she told me.

01:11:24.792 --> 01:11:27.875
- Told you what?
- Where she lived.

01:11:28.167 --> 01:11:30.215
Isn't that what you were wondering?
How I knew?

01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:33.675
I was just wondering what other girls
you were talking about.

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:37.379
The girls that were mutilated
and murdered.

01:11:38.583 --> 01:11:41.211
It's all over the news.

01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:44.336
Rita had the same profile.

01:11:44.792 --> 01:11:46.590
Don't you think?

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:50.129
The police never mentioned anything
about other girls.

01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:54.376
It's probably an ongoing investigation.
That's why.

01:11:58.917 --> 01:12:02.046
Anna, you need to relax.

01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:05.553
- Let me massage you again.
- It's okay.

01:12:05.792 --> 01:12:08.261
I- I would justÉ

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:11.177
rather go to sleep, okay?

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:13.802
And we talk tomorrow.

01:12:15.083 --> 01:12:16.551
I'm very tired.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:18.423
Wait!

01:12:19.667 --> 01:12:23.672
I came all over across town
to be with you in your time of need.

01:12:24.917 --> 01:12:27.966
Well, I would rather be alone.

01:12:28.875 --> 01:12:30.343
Please.

01:12:30.542 --> 01:12:32.795
Being alone isn't going
to help you.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.503
Believe me. I know.

01:12:35.667 --> 01:12:39.467
I'm just gonna ask you
to leave now. Please.

01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:41.593
What's the matter, Anna?

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:44.378
I thought we've become friends,
you and I.

01:12:44.958 --> 01:12:47.336
You sound like a stranger.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.219
Why are you scared?

01:12:56.583 --> 01:12:58.585
Anna, come.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.378
I think we need to
have a little talk.

01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:05.298
Get off me.

01:13:08.875 --> 01:13:10.673
Just calm down.

01:13:11.792 --> 01:13:15.046
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:18.424
It seems that we need to
iron a few things.

01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:20.927
You know what I mean, don't you?

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:26.336
Come, I think we need
to have a serious talk.

01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:34.299
- Get off me!
- Let me explain it to you!

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:37.381
Get off!

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.923
Martin! Help me!

01:13:52.292 --> 01:13:53.919
Help!

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:07.379
- What's the matter, Anna?
- Leave me alone.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.468
Go away.
Please, go away.

01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:12.754
<i>Anna, it's me, Martin.
Open the door.</i>

01:14:12.958 --> 01:14:16.132
<i>Anna, what's happening in there?
Is everything alright?</i>

01:14:20.167 --> 01:14:22.465
<i>Anna, open the door.</i>

01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:30.585
- Anna?
- Martin!

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:33.503
- Anna, where are you?
- In the bathroom.

01:14:42.083 --> 01:14:44.381
Anna, open up.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.126
I'm sorry.

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:49.879
I'm sorry.
Open the door.

01:14:51.208 --> 01:14:53.302
Open the door! Anna!

01:14:54.875 --> 01:14:58.084
- Martin?
- No, it's not Martin.

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.218
It's just you and me.

01:15:00.375 --> 01:15:04.255
Now open up and let me explain!

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:07.174
- Martin, are you okay?
- Anna.

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:09.256
It's me.

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:16.173
What's happening?

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:26.960
I came all across the town
to be with you in your time of need.

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:30.298
I'm sorry. Please.

01:15:31.375 --> 01:15:33.377
Let's talk first.

01:15:33.583 --> 01:15:35.426
Leave me alone!

01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:38.048
- Just go.
- No.

01:15:38.208 --> 01:15:41.712
- You need to understand.
- Go, please.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.173
Put the knife down.

01:15:48.167 --> 01:15:50.920
Put the knife, Anna.
Put the knife down.

01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:54.301
Put the knife down!

01:16:06.167 --> 01:16:08.135
Just calm down.

01:16:09.667 --> 01:16:11.510
Calm down.

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:14.591
Just relax, just relax.

01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:17.173
It's okay.

01:16:18.625 --> 01:16:20.423
It's okay.

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:28.176
Okay.

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:50.045
<i>Patrol 19, stand by.
Code 4-8.</i>

01:16:50.208 --> 01:16:52.757
<i>Possible suicide.
Marian Avenue 728.</i>

01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:55.336
<i>This is 19, we're on our way.</i>

01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:10.585
It's gonna be okay.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.127
Anna, please!

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:47.585
Help!

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:52.051
Help!

01:17:55.792 --> 01:17:57.465
Anna!

01:17:57.583 --> 01:17:59.426
Somebody?

01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:07.336
Wait!
Anna!

01:18:36.875 --> 01:18:38.969
- Help me!
- Anna.

01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:41.127
- Stop the car!
- What are you doing?

01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:43.548
- Help!
- No.

01:18:45.083 --> 01:18:47.085
No! No, no, no!

01:19:15.875 --> 01:19:17.468
Oh, no!

01:19:31.083 --> 01:19:33.461
Anna! Why did you do that?

01:19:39.125 --> 01:19:41.469
Didn't you understand?

01:19:42.083 --> 01:19:44.552
I just wanted to be with you.

01:19:44.708 --> 01:19:47.757
I just wanted to be with you, Anna.

01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:51.094
I never touched you.

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:52.505
Not once.

01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:58.254
Anna, I want to introduce you
to my mother.

01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:30.792
We'll be together forever, Anna.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.843
I promise.

01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:44.550
No one will separate us again.

01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:41.835
Hey Frank.

01:21:43.375 --> 01:21:46.504
- Do you like my nipples, Frank?
- Shut up!

01:21:47.333 --> 01:21:49.631
God, your hands are so warm.

01:21:49.875 --> 01:21:52.219
- I'm gonna get you back, Frank.
- She's lying.

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:54.673
Please don't listen to her.
Don't listen to her.

01:21:54.833 --> 01:21:58.087
Did you play with dolls
as a child, Fred?

01:21:58.292 --> 01:22:00.260
You wanna take a bath?

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:02.552
- No.
- You wanna take a bubble bath?

01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:03.960
No. I do not.

01:22:05.042 --> 01:22:07.386
Now leave. Leave!

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:11.962
Oh, Frank. What happened?

01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:16.005
I knew you were in the locker,
you naughty boy.

01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:18.631
Did you like what you saw, Frank?

01:22:18.792 --> 01:22:21.136
Don't listen to them.
They're lying.

01:22:21.292 --> 01:22:23.886
Frank, don't bring
any other girls home.

01:22:24.083 --> 01:22:26.006
I get jealous.

01:22:26.167 --> 01:22:28.761
I'm gonna tear you to pieces, Frank.

01:22:28.958 --> 01:22:31.962
I don't even know them.
They're lying.

01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:37.590
This is our home, Anna.

01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:39.551
Welcome.

01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:44.339
Welcome.

01:22:44.458 --> 01:22:47.792
This is where we live now, Anna.

01:22:51.708 --> 01:22:53.961
No, not you! Get out of here!

01:22:54.125 --> 01:22:56.344
You hear me? Get out!

01:22:56.458 --> 01:22:59.883
Don't come near her. She is mine!
Do you hear me?

01:23:00.083 --> 01:23:01.551
Get away!

01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:03.335
She belongs to me!

01:23:03.458 --> 01:23:06.792
You will never understand
what we feel for one another.

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:09.051
Where is she? Where is she?

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.801
Answer me!

01:23:12.083 --> 01:23:13.801
Get your hands off of me!

01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:15.881
Please. Let go.

01:23:20.833 --> 01:23:21.959
Ah, my leg!
