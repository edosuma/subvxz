00:05.547 --> 00:07.007
<i>And with this loss,</i>

00:07.007 --> 00:09.760
<i>Richmond's dreary winless streak continues.</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:13.847
<i>Another two goals for Zava are not enough</i>

00:13.847 --> 00:16.808
<i>as Newcastle dismantle
the Greyhounds 4-2.</i>

00:16.808 --> 00:19.102
<i>The talent is clearly on the field, Chris.</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:21.104
<i>It sure is, Arlo.</i>

00:21.104 --> 00:23.357
<i>The problem with this team
might be in the dugout.</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.441
Damn it!

00:25.192 --> 00:26.360
Fuck.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.698
Chris, since their loss to Nathan Shelley
and West Ham last month,

00:31.698 --> 00:34.576
it seems the Greyhounds
have been dropping like a stone.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.788
Well, all objects drop
at the same rate, Arlo. Except feathers.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.751
Well said, Chris.
When Zava arrived, it was sunny days.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.586
<i>But now, if you're a Richmond fan,</i>

00:44.586 --> 00:47.548
<i>you've got to feel
like nothing is going your way.</i>

00:47.548 --> 00:50.008
Boo! Boo!

00:50.008 --> 00:52.052
<i>Things go from bad to worse</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:54.638
<i>as Richmond welcome Manchester City
mid-week.</i>

00:54.638 --> 00:59.101
<i>They are not in form to finally crack
the code against their sky-blue tormentors</i>

00:59.101 --> 01:01.270
<i>as they fall to ninth place.</i>

01:02.521 --> 01:05.482
I knew positive thinking was bullshit!

01:12.823 --> 01:15.659
- Oh. Wow, that's not very nice.
- What?

01:16.451 --> 01:19.997
"Even with Zava,
Richmond eat more arse than your mum."

01:19.997 --> 01:21.790
Buddy, you gotta get off Twitter.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.750
This is a text from my father.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.461
Oh, boy. I just don't get it.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.629
You know?

01:27.629 --> 01:30.841
The effort was there, as always.
We just can't get over that hump.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.343
I don't know what the heck the problem is.
Do you guys?

01:33.343 --> 01:35.637
- Our defense is in shambles.
- Our offense is stale.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.472
And if the boys
are gonna fucking stand around

01:37.472 --> 01:40.642
watching fucking Zava all fucking match,
we should make them buy fucking tickets.

01:41.727 --> 01:44.855
Okay, so some constructive criticism.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.398
- I appreciate that.
- Mmm.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.735
Hey, Boss. What's going on?

01:49.735 --> 01:52.404
I just have one quick question for you.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.406
Are we ever gonna win
another fucking match?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.412
Um...

02:02.289 --> 02:07.836
Well, I hear the concern in your voice
and its volume.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.840
And it's funny
'cause we were just brainstorming in here,

02:11.840 --> 02:14.134
coming up with some real strong solves.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.472
You know what we're gonna do?
Pretend this club was a ship.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.891
We're gonna take that ship,
we're gonna turn around.

02:20.891 --> 02:21.850
Go against the tide,

02:21.850 --> 02:24.645
point that baby right at the North Star
and follow it all the way home.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.980
That's north, Ted.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.650
- This way is. Okay.
- I'm pretty sure it's that way.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.902
- That's what I meant. That way.
- No, it's right fucking that way.

02:31.902 --> 02:35.155
- You know, I'm discombobulated.
- No! You're all wrong! It's that way!

02:35.155 --> 02:36.573
Shoot.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.158
I think.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.493
Hmm.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.438
- Mmm.
- Can I take this for you?

03:08.438 --> 03:09.898
You can. Thank you very much.

03:17.239 --> 03:20.158
Sorry,
do you think you can take this as well?

03:20.158 --> 03:21.952
Rebecca.

03:23.412 --> 03:27.040
John Wingsnight. What a lovely surprise.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.960
- Hello.
- Oh, uh, this is Jessica Darling.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.754
Jessica, darling, Rebecca Welton.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.424
- It's so lovely to meet you.
- Oh, hi. Likewise. Hello, there.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.509
Uh, we actually went out on a few dates.

03:37.509 --> 03:41.096
And then Rebecca dumped me out of nowhere.
In this exact coffee shop.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.473
Not that I come here all the time,
hoping to run into you.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.184
- 'Cause I don't.
- Okay.

03:45.184 --> 03:48.228
Well, may I say, Rebecca, thank you.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.607
We're engaged.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.650
Ring-a-ding-ding. Wedding calling.

03:54.151 --> 03:58.155
Engaged. Congratulations.
That's-- Wow.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.157
How-- did it happen?

04:00.157 --> 04:02.659
Oh, we matched on the apps,
uh, six months ago.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.662
Not Bantr. Couldn't use that.
It felt a bit weird since, uh--

04:05.662 --> 04:08.415
- Yeah.
- And in a sea of anythings,

04:08.415 --> 04:11.793
I went fishing
and caught myself a soul mate.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.961
Oh.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.630
Took her
to see <i>Hamilton</i> on our first date.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.882
- Amazing.
- And then defended my honor.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.760
Oh, God. Yeah. Get this.
It's intermission.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.762
We're standing in line
to buy the CD of the soundtrack,

04:21.762 --> 04:24.264
'cause I refuse to stream music.
And guess who's standing in front of us.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.643
- Sir Anthony Hopkins.
- Can you imagine?

04:27.643 --> 04:30.354
- Nope.
- Jessica politely taps him on the shoulder

04:30.354 --> 04:33.607
and asks if he'll film a little video
for Jessica's father as Hannibal Lecter,

04:33.607 --> 04:34.650
you know.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.485
- And he said no.
- Yeah.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.154
So I grabbed that rapscallion
by the collar,

04:39.154 --> 04:41.406
and I said, "Hey,
we didn't ask you to be famous."

04:41.406 --> 04:45.953
And took a quick ussie of the three of us
and emailed it to her-- her dad's nurse.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.120
Made his day.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.748
My shite in nining armor.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.085
What? I just--

04:53.085 --> 04:54.169
What did you say?

04:54.169 --> 04:56.213
You jumbled your words there a bit.

04:56.213 --> 04:59.299
What did you-- You just said,
"shite in nining armor"?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.885
Yeah. I-- I meant to say
"knight in shining armor."

05:01.885 --> 05:04.096
I just-- One of me brain farts.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.014
Quite rare for her.
She's actually very smart.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.724
Went to Oxford for a bit.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.477
Wait, n-no, you said,
"shite in nining armor."

05:10.477 --> 05:12.563
You actually said those specific words.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.690
I did.

05:14.690 --> 05:17.067
Anyway, uh, we should go.
Lovely to see you, Rebecca.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.279
You okay? Have you eaten?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.873
I completely understand
where Barbara's coming from,

05:31.373 --> 05:33.125
but as I was explaining to you,

05:33.125 --> 05:37.212
I'm worried that by adding more clients,
that could mean less attention paid

05:37.212 --> 05:39.131
to the wonderful people
we already represent.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.925
And then I-- I reminded Keeley,

05:41.925 --> 05:46.263
as you've said so many times, Jack,
that, um, if it does get to the point

05:46.263 --> 05:48.098
where we feel
we're spreading ourselves thinly,

05:48.098 --> 05:49.725
then we'll hire more people.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.435
It's called "growth."

05:52.853 --> 05:55.898
- Okay. Uh, let me weigh in here.
- Oh, please.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.567
- I agree with Keeley.
- Well, that's great.

05:58.567 --> 06:02.154
Being a small boutique firm
is exactly what sets you apart.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.699
You want a restaurant to look successful,
you take out half the tables

06:05.699 --> 06:07.159
and you have a line out the door.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.036
I say let's go for it.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.956
- Hmm.
- No, that's wonderful. Yeah.

06:12.956 --> 06:17.711
And instead of salaries,
we can give away the tables we threw out.

06:18.378 --> 06:22.382
- Don't worry, Barbara. It'll be great.
- Oh, yeah. Yes. Definitely.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.804
You ever think
sunshine gets jealous of her?

06:29.014 --> 06:30.974
- Knock, knock.
- Hi, babe.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.060
Now that your little, uh,
cool girls meeting's done,

06:33.060 --> 06:35.521
just wanted to share the exciting news
that I've started an app.

06:35.521 --> 06:36.647
Oh.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.941
It's like Bantr,
but it's better and cooler

06:38.941 --> 06:42.194
and actually cares about helping people
have sex with celebrities.

06:42.778 --> 06:43.987
What? Shandy.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.114
It's called "Star Fuckr."

06:48.033 --> 06:51.286
And, yeah, we are looking for investors.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.295
I take it she's still angry
about the whole Bantr thing?

07:00.295 --> 07:02.089
Oh, yes. Mmm.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.551
Shandy does not have a good relationship
with rejection, or her ex,

07:05.551 --> 07:09.805
or with the workplace,
or most nouns, really.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.975
"You are so passionate,
but I have to let you go.

07:14.268 --> 07:17.771
I'm sorry, but I know someone as brilliant
as you will land on their feet."

07:19.439 --> 07:20.482
What did I do?

07:20.482 --> 07:22.776
No, no, no, no. Keeley, sor-- sorry.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.987
That's what you say when you fire Shandy.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.739
Oh, my God.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.284
Sorry.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.160
It's called a compliment sandwich.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.164
You-- You give someone bad news,
but to soften the blow,

07:36.164 --> 07:39.042
you slap it between two delicious slices
of compliments.

07:39.042 --> 07:42.254
Oh. But I can't fire Shandy.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.423
She'll hate me.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.216
And she really thinks she's killing it.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.551
Oh, I am sure she does.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.636
The worst people
often think they're the best.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.722
My dad calls it "talent dysmorphia."

07:52.556 --> 07:53.932
That's good.

07:55.601 --> 07:58.103
You wanna get some lunch?
My-- My meeting just got pushed.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.354
Abso-fucking-lutely!

07:59.354 --> 08:02.482
Yeah, my stomach started grumbling
when you said "compliment sandwich."

08:10.449 --> 08:14.411
- Aw, shit. Come and look at this.
- Ooh.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.333
Man, how the fuck
does Nate bag a baddie like Anastasia?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.709
Oh, maybe she made a bet.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.419
- Oh. In, like, <i>She's All That</i>.
- Yeah.

08:22.419 --> 08:26.089
Yes! But Nate does not have glasses
and a ponytail hiding his beauty.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.174
Nah, fuck no.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.967
His transformation's gonna be
on the inside.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.427
- Yeah.
- You know, <i>She's All That</i>

08:30.427 --> 08:32.763
is just the film version of the musical
<i>My Fair Lady</i>.

08:32.763 --> 08:35.307
Which is based
on the George Bernard Shaw play <i>Pygmalion</i>.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.392
I love pigs. They are cute

08:37.392 --> 08:40.437
but also have the same intelligence
as a human toddler.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.438
Yeah,
but Anastasia's just really fit, innit?

08:42.438 --> 08:44.399
- Oh, yeah. She's very pretty.
- She's the coldest, bro.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.653
Hey, Zava. What do you think of Anastasia?

08:49.488 --> 08:50.614
I don't.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.243
My wife, Christina, is the only woman
I see with clarity.

08:55.077 --> 08:58.413
Every other woman is a smudge.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.332
Wow.

09:00.332 --> 09:04.002
My wife is sexy,
but in a girl-next-door kind of way.

09:04.837 --> 09:07.339
Glasses, ponytail, she paints.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.841
Like the girl in <i>She's All That</i>.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.344
- Like what?
- It's a movie.

09:12.344 --> 09:16.181
Oh, I don't care about,
uh, moving pictures.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.475
My favorite thing to watch is my wife.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.186
Wow.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.607
If we stay with our 4-5-1, we're fucked.

09:25.607 --> 09:30.279
If we move to 4-4-2, we're fucked.
But if we try a 5-3-2...

09:30.279 --> 09:31.947
- We're gonna win?
- We're fucked.

09:31.947 --> 09:35.033
- Shoot. Hmm.
- Man City.

09:35.033 --> 09:38.120
I can't believe our white whale
has the same name as the strip club

09:38.120 --> 09:40.289
where I danced in college.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.251
Um...

09:44.251 --> 09:46.420
What's going on, Trent?
You got an idea for us?

09:46.420 --> 09:49.590
Um, no, I can't. I'm, uh--
I'm only here to observe.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.342
- I-- I couldn't, um, interfere.
- I get it.

09:52.342 --> 09:56.263
You know, you're kinda like one
of them sadistic nature documentarians

09:56.263 --> 09:57.639
that won't put down their camera

09:57.639 --> 10:02.102
even though they see a poor, defenseless,
adorable, little, injured monkey

10:02.102 --> 10:04.938
about to get attacked by a pack of hyenas.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.039
All right. Okay.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.834
Have you ever considered
an old-school long-ball game?

10:25.834 --> 10:27.878
- Oh, what, like route one?
- What's that?

10:27.878 --> 10:30.422
A kick-and-rush tactic
that can be a viable option

10:30.422 --> 10:33.091
for an overmatched team
against a superior opponent.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.010
Okay, well, great. Let's do that then.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.845
Nah, their center backs are too athletic.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.014
- They'd murder us.
- Yeah, you're fucked.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.724
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.276
- Uh...
- Everything okay, Ted?

10:51.276 --> 10:54.488
Uh,
Henry got bullied at school this morning.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.199
If we leave right now

10:57.199 --> 10:59.785
and take the connecting flight
through Paris,

10:59.785 --> 11:01.245
we can be in Kansas by noon,

11:01.245 --> 11:03.830
and that punk's house
will be in ashes by 12:30!

11:03.830 --> 11:07.125
No, no. Best thing you can do
with bullies is ignore them.

11:09.044 --> 11:13.465
Then you sneak into their house
at 4:00 a.m.,

11:13.465 --> 11:14.967
which, statistically speaking,

11:14.967 --> 11:17.678
is the hour people are least prepared
to defend themselves.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.595
Correct.

11:18.595 --> 11:22.891
And once you're standing over them,
as they sleep in their bed,

11:23.934 --> 11:25.143
you start to beat them.

11:26.270 --> 11:31.775
With a thick, heavy rope
soaked in red paint.

11:32.609 --> 11:37.239
Pummeling them over and over
until they wake,

11:38.073 --> 11:40.284
confusing the paint for their own blood.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.412
When they beg you to stop,

11:44.246 --> 11:48.500
you laugh as loud as you can,

11:49.001 --> 11:51.420
for as long as you can.

11:52.045 --> 11:56.758
And then you start to beat them again.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.226
Mmm. Yeah.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.772
You know,
I may just hold off on anything like that

12:10.772 --> 12:12.941
until I connect with Michelle
and just get the details,

12:12.941 --> 12:14.359
see what actually happened.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.736
Yeah, all right. Yeah, fair enough.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.779
- But thank you.
- Pleasure.

12:22.910 --> 12:23.744
Hmm.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.454
Rebecca, do you have a moment?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.122
Of course.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.211
May I have a seat?

12:32.211 --> 12:35.506
Leslie, this formality
is really freaking me out. Just sit.

12:40.844 --> 12:46.141
The thing is,
the club is going in the wrong direction,

12:46.141 --> 12:50.103
and I fear that it has little to do
with the quality of our players.

12:50.103 --> 12:54.983
Therefore, if we don't do well
against City, we may have to consider--

12:54.983 --> 12:57.945
think about thinking about possibly,

12:57.945 --> 13:01.240
maybe focusing on theoretically,

13:01.240 --> 13:05.118
as it were,
changing the manager of our club.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.620
You want to fire Ted?

13:06.620 --> 13:11.291
At what point during any of that
did it seem like something I wanted to do?

13:11.875 --> 13:14.461
Leslie,
this is too bleak for me at the moment.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.256
Therefore, I am granting myself permission
to change the subject.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.091
Do you believe in psychics?

13:19.967 --> 13:22.803
Oh. Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.096
Why doesn't that surprise me?

13:24.096 --> 13:27.432
I mean you're so, I don't know whimsical.

13:27.432 --> 13:31.687
Thank you.
My Aunt Devorah has a touch of the shine,

13:31.687 --> 13:33.689
a little bit of the inner eye.

13:33.689 --> 13:37.818
And she predicted that Julie and I
would have five children, all boys.

13:38.694 --> 13:39.695
And look at us now.

13:39.695 --> 13:42.531
Just a house
full of soaking wet toilet seats.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.616
Uh, why do you ask?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.618
Oh, a few weeks ago,

13:46.618 --> 13:49.705
I sort of went and saw a psychic.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.916
Not sort of. I-- I completely saw one.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.294
Wha-- Wow!
What did she say about the season?

13:55.919 --> 13:57.838
- I didn't ask.
- Ah.

13:57.838 --> 14:02.092
She was a bit of a quack. But she did say
a couple of things would happen,

14:02.092 --> 14:04.303
and now they've happened.

14:04.303 --> 14:05.387
Mmm.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.763
That's odd, isn't it?

14:07.431 --> 14:09.975
The universe is full of things
we can't explain, Rebecca.

14:10.601 --> 14:12.561
Fingernails. What's that about?

14:13.061 --> 14:15.689
And psychics,
even if some of them are charlatans,

14:15.689 --> 14:18.025
they can help us see
something in ourselves

14:18.025 --> 14:21.445
that we can't quite see ourselves.

14:25.073 --> 14:25.908
Thank you, Leslie.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.868
Mmm. Hmm.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.672
Oh, hello, Ms. Kakes.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.553
- From Rupert?
- My friend Anastasia.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.638
She wants you to call her.

14:48.972 --> 14:52.059
She was surprised you didn't ask
for her number at Bones & Honey.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.686
Well, I didn't want to appear too forward.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.736
Okay.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.416
Oh, um, hello.
Uh, I'm glad that I've caught you.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.252
It's, uh, Nathan Shelley.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.629
Uh, I really enjoyed meeting you
the other night,

15:20.629 --> 15:23.257
and I was hoping that we could meet
for another drink.

15:24.758 --> 15:28.262
Yeah, sorry, Mum. I'm just, uh,
practicing for the-- Yeah. How was I?

15:30.264 --> 15:33.684
"I think we should meet for another drink"
is more direct.

15:33.684 --> 15:36.937
Yeah. Okay, yeah. Thank you.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.064
All right, love you. Bye-bye. Bye.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.149
Okay.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.819
Should go for another drink. Should.

15:52.411 --> 15:53.954
- Hey, Coach.
- Hello, Rebecca.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.668
- Ted.
- No, I know, I know, I know.

15:59.668 --> 16:03.547
You are still feeling bad
about yelling at me the other day, right?

16:04.756 --> 16:05.966
I can be a little bit psychic.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.260
It's okay.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.722
No, yes, I-- I shouldn't have bullied you.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.561
- Nice speaking with you, boss.
- You too, Ted.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.490
Afternoon.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.291
Hi.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.168
Ms. Jones.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.837
- Hope you enjoyed your lunch with Jack.
- Mmm.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.797
Um, just a quick question.

16:45.797 --> 16:49.760
Did you tell Shandy to call Emma Jayye
at 4:00 in the morning,

16:49.760 --> 16:53.514
whilst drunk on "espresso martinis,"

16:53.514 --> 16:57.726
to pitch her an idea
for "condoms for balls"?

16:57.726 --> 17:00.938
- What?
- Emma Jayye designs sunglasses.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.774
Yeah, no, of course I didn't do that. Why?

17:03.774 --> 17:05.608
Oh, because she just fired us.

17:07.486 --> 17:08.779
Because of Shandy.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.489
Because of your friend.

17:13.242 --> 17:14.242
Shandy.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.662
- Yeah?
- Can I speak with you, please?

17:16.662 --> 17:19.705
- Can you give me 30 minutes?
- No, now.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.459
- Please can I watch?
- Barbara.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.132
Hi. I can give you five minutes,

17:29.132 --> 17:31.385
then I have to go downstairs
and meet with a potential assistant.

17:31.385 --> 17:33.512
She's scared of elevators.
It's cute, right?

17:34.388 --> 17:36.098
Can you come have a seat, please?

17:36.098 --> 17:37.182
Yeah.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.403
Shandy.

17:51.405 --> 17:52.614
Am I getting a raise?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.451
You are so brilliant.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.162
But...

18:01.540 --> 18:05.335
My bold determination? What the fuck?

18:07.588 --> 18:10.757
All right! Listen up, sheep.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.804
I was just let go because some people
can't handle working with an innovator.

18:16.763 --> 18:21.226
So, I'm starting my own PR firm
to take this place down.

18:22.853 --> 18:23.896
Who's coming with me?

18:28.233 --> 18:29.693
I'll pay you double
what you're making here.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.777
Who's coming with me?

18:33.071 --> 18:34.114
All right.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.492
Three months holiday every year,
company car,

18:37.492 --> 18:40.871
massage table in the office
with a licensed masseuse.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.206
Who's coming with me?

18:44.208 --> 18:45.751
I'll go with you.

18:46.335 --> 18:47.961
- Not you, Dan.
- Right.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.257
Barbara. I know you're with me.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.551
I couldn't be less with you.

18:54.551 --> 18:59.765
That's because you're a coward,
and I fucking hate you.

18:59.765 --> 19:02.559
I hate all of you!

19:02.559 --> 19:04.895
Oh, Keeley, please let me stay.

19:04.895 --> 19:08.273
I just love it here so much.
We're a family.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.067
- I love you.
- You're gonna be fine, Shandy. I pro--

19:10.067 --> 19:11.318
No, I'm not!

19:11.318 --> 19:15.572
Oh, you bunch of fascist fucks!

19:18.617 --> 19:22.913
I fucking-- You fucking ten-percenters.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.289
Yeah, that's what you are.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.544
You know what? Fuck you all.

19:29.253 --> 19:30.337
That's ours.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.423
Well, fuck off then.

19:34.550 --> 19:35.592
Dan, let's go.

19:35.592 --> 19:36.969
Actually, I'm staying.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.138
Suck my dick.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.100
All right.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.187
Mmm.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.481
Well, I'm not gonna say it.

19:49.481 --> 19:50.649
No, but you're gonna think it.

19:50.649 --> 19:52.901
Yes, often. And forever.

20:03.495 --> 20:07.332
Hello, there. I'm Rebecca Welton.
I have an appointment with Dr. Wagner.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.042
Fill this out,
and he'll be right with you.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.128
- Ah, thank you so much. Thank you.
- Take a seat.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.996
- Rebecca. What a nice surprise.
- Ah.

20:45.996 --> 20:48.123
- You don't have to fill out all that junk.
- Oh.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.791
- Come on back, my dear.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.214
- Thank you.
- Take a seat.

20:55.214 --> 20:56.757
- Yep. Thank you.
- Make yourself at home.

21:02.721 --> 21:06.350
So, how are you holding up?

21:09.061 --> 21:10.979
Given Richmond's current slump?

21:10.979 --> 21:13.941
You poor thing. So stressful, it must be.

21:13.941 --> 21:17.027
Well, it's been a bit tough, I'll admit.

21:17.027 --> 21:20.989
But, um,
we're just in a bit of a bad stretch.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.325
Well, it will all work out. I know it.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.744
As long as you have Zava,
you'll be just fine.

21:25.744 --> 21:28.288
- He's amazing, isn't he?
- He is. Yes.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.998
Yes, we're, uh-- we're lucky to have him.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.794
So tell me, what brings you in today?

21:34.711 --> 21:40.801
Right. So, um, you know, I'm--
I'm aware that what I'm about to ask,

21:40.801 --> 21:44.555
given my age, uh, is a bit far-fetched.

21:45.389 --> 21:48.016
But I was just wondering if...

21:48.016 --> 21:50.352
If you're able to have children?

21:51.270 --> 21:53.021
Yes. That.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.274
It's not far-fetched at all.

21:56.149 --> 21:59.278
I treat women your age, and older,
all of the time.

21:59.862 --> 22:01.613
- You do?
- Absolutely.

22:02.406 --> 22:04.867
Now, that said, I can't guarantee--

22:04.867 --> 22:06.702
Oh, no, of course. I know.

22:06.702 --> 22:10.414
But we can run some tests
and see what's possible. Sound good?

22:11.248 --> 22:13.041
Great. Yep. Thank you.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.710
Well, uh, sit tight, relax.

22:14.710 --> 22:18.297
I'll have our tech, uh, take some blood
and do some imaging.

22:18.297 --> 22:20.924
- Wonderful to see you.
- Likewise.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.259
Go Richmond!

22:42.362 --> 22:43.447
Right, listen up.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.576
When you're leaving,
get yourself a shower. Get some rest.

22:48.285 --> 22:51.705
More importantly,
no video games before bedtime.

22:52.664 --> 22:55.292
Unless it's Animal Crossing.
That shit's fucking soothing.

22:55.292 --> 22:57.211
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Well done, guys.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.214
You know, I think we're really starting
to turn our fortunes around.

23:00.214 --> 23:02.591
- Well, actually, Sam--
- Jan Maas, no need.

23:03.175 --> 23:05.761
Sam, we're playing like shit,
and we all know it.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.596
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

23:07.596 --> 23:10.557
Hey. Enough of that negativity.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.311
Yeah, City are great. They just are.

23:14.311 --> 23:16.647
But who the fuck cares? 'Cause so are we.

23:16.647 --> 23:20.108
So stop acting
like a bunch of little bunny rabbits.

23:20.651 --> 23:22.694
Let's fucking do this, yeah?

23:28.492 --> 23:29.868
Jamie is so right.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.457
It's as if he were Zava.

23:36.375 --> 23:37.376
Get off me, man.

23:37.376 --> 23:40.295
You see, I am no prophet.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.090
Prophets believe in something.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.801
I do not just believe.

23:47.261 --> 23:52.432
I know in my heart, in my bones,

23:53.308 --> 23:55.561
in my well-defined delts, traps and glutes

23:57.187 --> 23:59.898
that there is no opponent
this team cannot conquer.

23:59.898 --> 24:01.483
I literally just said that.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.111
You will not win because of me.

24:06.154 --> 24:09.616
You will win because you work together.

24:10.659 --> 24:11.827
Because together...

24:14.830 --> 24:16.874
you can achieve anything.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.921
Manchester City is going down!

24:41.481 --> 24:42.900
Hey. There you are.

24:42.900 --> 24:45.027
<i>Hey, Ted.
I'm sorry we kept missing each other.</i>

24:45.027 --> 24:47.362
That's okay. I get it, you know?

24:48.197 --> 24:49.281
How's the little guy doing?

24:49.281 --> 24:51.533
<i>He's okay.
He's actually at the park right now.</i>

24:52.117 --> 24:53.785
He is? Oh, that's great.

24:53.785 --> 24:57.039
<i>Yeah. Jake thought it'd be a good idea
to get outside, get some fresh air.</i>

24:58.415 --> 25:02.252
Yeah. No, that's, uh--
that's-- that's smart. Yeah.

25:02.252 --> 25:04.713
Um, what about you? How are you doing?

25:04.713 --> 25:06.798
<i>Oh, I've definitely been better.</i>

25:06.798 --> 25:07.883
I hear you.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.969
I've been pulling my hair out
all day over this.

25:11.470 --> 25:13.764
You know, I actually told Beard and Roy
about what happened.

25:13.764 --> 25:16.058
Those fellas were ready
to hop on a flight to Kansas

25:16.058 --> 25:18.894
and go full Wicked Witch of the West
on the kid that bullied him.

25:20.354 --> 25:25.067
<i>No, Ted, um, Henry wasn't bullied.
He was the bully.</i>

25:26.693 --> 25:27.694
What?

25:29.112 --> 25:31.740
<i>AFC Richmond versus Manchester City.</i>

25:31.740 --> 25:34.618
<i>Normally, the Greyhound faithful
mark the loss on the calendar</i>

25:34.618 --> 25:36.203
<i>before the match is even played.</i>

25:36.703 --> 25:39.456
<i>But tonight, with Zava, hope is in the air</i>

25:39.456 --> 25:43.335
<i>that Richmond will finally prevail
in this decidedly one-sided rivalry.</i>

25:45.796 --> 25:47.381
It's, uh, quitting time.

25:47.381 --> 25:48.924
I'll see you tomorrow, Dan.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.592
No.

25:51.552 --> 25:52.845
I quit.

25:55.514 --> 25:56.640
No, no. I'm joking.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.852
U-Unless you want me to quit?

25:59.852 --> 26:02.980
- No, I'd love to see you tomorrow, Dan.
- Okay.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.523
- Night.
- All right. Thank you.

26:07.568 --> 26:10.195
- Good night, Ms. Jones.
- Oh, night, Barbara.

26:10.195 --> 26:11.905
- Barbara?
- Oh.

26:11.905 --> 26:13.490
Ooh!

26:13.490 --> 26:17.327
Do you wanna go see
the Richmond match tonight? Either of you?

26:17.327 --> 26:19.663
Will it be as violent as last time?

26:20.539 --> 26:22.708
- Probably not.
- Then no.

26:24.168 --> 26:25.127
I'll tag along.

26:25.127 --> 26:27.004
Uh, can I borrow your office
to make some calls?

26:27.629 --> 26:29.298
Oh, yes, of course. Yes.

26:29.298 --> 26:31.675
Just don't look in my desk drawer.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.052
Don't.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.351
I'm definitely gonna look
in those drawers.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.895
Mmm-hmm.

26:51.945 --> 26:53.238
Zava! Zava!

26:54.406 --> 26:58.035
Zava! Zava! Zava! Zava!

26:58.035 --> 26:59.119
Peel 'em.

26:59.119 --> 27:00.204
Slice 'em.

27:00.204 --> 27:01.288
- Cut 'em.
- Yeah.

27:01.288 --> 27:02.664
- Mash 'em.
- I'm not playing.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.458
- Cheer until your voice bleeds.
- Okay.

27:04.458 --> 27:05.584
Eat 'em.

27:05.584 --> 27:07.544
- Outclass 'em, Sam.
- Thank you, Coach.

27:09.755 --> 27:12.799
Oi. Where's Zava?

27:20.891 --> 27:22.392
Hey, Coach. Check it out.

27:22.392 --> 27:25.437
115 straight days,
no pee drops on the khakis. New record.

27:25.437 --> 27:26.688
Proud of you.

27:29.608 --> 27:30.651
You connect with Henry yet?

27:30.651 --> 27:32.027
No, keep missing each other.

27:32.903 --> 27:35.989
Why can't the world just have
one big time zone, you know?

27:35.989 --> 27:40.452
- The sun.
- Right, the gosh-dang sun. Oy, oy, oy.

27:40.452 --> 27:43.413
Henry's a good kid, 'cause you're his dad.

27:43.413 --> 27:44.748
Mm-hmm.

27:44.748 --> 27:47.751
And whatever's going on with him,
he's gonna be just fine.

27:48.836 --> 27:50.963
Thank you, Coach. I needed to hear that.

27:50.963 --> 27:53.215
No, you needed to hear it.

27:53.882 --> 27:55.634
- That's what I said.
- You did?

27:57.678 --> 27:59.137
We got a fucking problem.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.104
Oh. Is that my...

28:07.813 --> 28:10.399
Two questions. Um, are you ready
to leave for the match?

28:10.399 --> 28:13.735
And do you smell that awful stench?

28:14.319 --> 28:16.196
Yes and yes.

28:20.117 --> 28:21.827
Oh, my God. What was that?

28:25.455 --> 28:26.748
That is fucking weird.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.293
Oh! Wow!

28:30.085 --> 28:31.753
What the fuck?

28:31.753 --> 28:33.172
Where did that come from?

28:35.048 --> 28:36.466
Oh, my God.

28:39.553 --> 28:43.891
"The lion has left.
Enjoy the lamb, bitch. XOXO, Shandy."

28:46.351 --> 28:47.644
Jesus.

28:47.644 --> 28:50.439
It's a gentle reminder
to cancel her security badge.

28:51.899 --> 28:53.192
Fuck me.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.491
Oh, my God! That is so sour.

29:06.872 --> 29:08.081
After you.

29:09.291 --> 29:10.417
Oh.

29:10.417 --> 29:11.502
Ooh.

29:16.131 --> 29:19.384
Hello, Jade. Um, Shelley.

29:19.384 --> 29:21.637
Uh, reservation for two. Thank you.

29:23.639 --> 29:25.265
And you, miss? How can I help you?

29:25.265 --> 29:27.893
- Oh--
- Oh, no, she, uh-- We, uh--

29:27.893 --> 29:29.353
This is Anastasia.

29:29.353 --> 29:33.982
Uh, she is a very famous model, uh,
and we are on a date.

29:35.651 --> 29:38.320
Togeth-- Together.
Two. For two.

29:38.946 --> 29:39.780
Hello.

29:41.073 --> 29:43.367
Um, you have very cute head.

29:43.367 --> 29:45.869
Thank you. I got it from my father.

29:45.869 --> 29:48.580
- Right this way.
- Oh, no. Sorry, Jade, dear.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.375
Uh, we would like the, uh,
window table, please.

29:53.919 --> 29:56.380
- I'll have to go ask Derek.
- I already checked with Derek.

29:56.380 --> 30:01.009
Oh, Nathan Jelly! The wonder kid!

30:01.009 --> 30:02.219
Yeah. Touch it.

30:02.219 --> 30:03.512
- Hey!
- Uh-huh.

30:04.179 --> 30:05.556
And, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:06.390 --> 30:08.392
Slap me round the face. Am I dreaming?

30:08.392 --> 30:11.019
The one and only Anastasia
in my restaurant.

30:11.937 --> 30:14.022
I'm a huge fan of your face and body.

30:14.648 --> 30:18.819
Best table in the house for you two.
If you'd like to come this way?

30:23.699 --> 30:25.200
Oh. Yeah.

30:31.456 --> 30:32.833
There you go.

30:32.833 --> 30:34.793
- There you go.
- Thank you, Derek.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.003
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

30:42.801 --> 30:43.802
Hmm.

30:45.345 --> 30:47.014
It's not very nice in here.

30:48.390 --> 30:50.184
Oh. No, but--

30:50.184 --> 30:54.021
Just wait till you try
the food, 'cause the baklava is divine.

30:56.815 --> 30:57.816
Hmm.

31:28.222 --> 31:31.016
I have some bad news.

31:33.936 --> 31:35.521
Let's go, lads. Let's go! Come on!

31:36.021 --> 31:40.776
And Richmond are ready to start the game
with Colin Hughes in place of Zava.

31:41.318 --> 31:43.904
Hughes for Zava. Any thoughts, Chris?

31:43.904 --> 31:46.740
Yes. That's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen.

31:47.741 --> 31:50.911
<i>And we're off. But where is Zava?</i>

31:50.911 --> 31:52.538
Hey. Any news?

31:53.121 --> 31:54.122
Nobody knows where he is.

31:54.122 --> 31:55.958
That fucking prick's not answering
his phone.

31:55.958 --> 31:59.044
Neither is his agent, his manager,
his publicist, his trainer,

31:59.044 --> 32:03.257
his acupuncturist, his acupressurist,
his fecalist, his avocado whisperer,

32:03.257 --> 32:04.550
not even his barber.

32:04.550 --> 32:07.135
Hmm. Maybe he's dead.

32:07.135 --> 32:08.428
Fucking better be.

32:09.304 --> 32:12.432
<i>Richmond have played
without Zava for ten minutes,</i>

32:12.432 --> 32:14.560
<i>and we're all left wondering why.</i>

32:15.143 --> 32:18.981
Goodbye, my sweet little stinky friend.

32:20.023 --> 32:23.569
If Shandy asks to borrow an animal again,
please say no.

32:23.569 --> 32:25.279
Oh, sorry, Keeley.

32:25.279 --> 32:27.364
She promised to get a date
with a celebrity.

32:27.990 --> 32:30.117
I've always wanted to come out
of a restaurant and say,

32:30.117 --> 32:31.535
"No pictures, please."

32:31.535 --> 32:34.538
Edward, gotta love someone
for what they are, not who they are.

32:35.414 --> 32:36.248
Mmm.

32:36.248 --> 32:39.585
- And here is a giant bag of shit.
- Oh.

32:46.550 --> 32:49.303
Yeah. That's finally starting
to smell better, right?

32:49.303 --> 32:51.221
Better? Uh, sure.

32:51.722 --> 32:55.017
Now it smells like someone took a dump
directly into a pumpkin spice latte.

32:56.768 --> 32:59.479
Oi. I could use a drink actually.
You don't have anything, do you?

32:59.479 --> 33:01.148
Oh, shit. No, sorry.

33:02.858 --> 33:03.692
Wait.

33:11.491 --> 33:14.036
Shandy's work vodka
finally comes in handy.

33:14.036 --> 33:15.996
Nice. Where'd she hide that?

33:15.996 --> 33:17.247
On her desk.

33:18.415 --> 33:21.001
- Yeah.
- You probably want a mixer and ice.

33:21.543 --> 33:23.003
Candied oranges?

33:23.003 --> 33:24.421
Keeley, you're adorable.

33:25.005 --> 33:28.258
But I went to the most prestigious
boarding school in Denmark.

33:29.134 --> 33:30.844
We chugged warm vodka for breakfast.

33:31.345 --> 33:35.974
Wow. It takes a lot to surprise me,
and yet you just did.

33:36.975 --> 33:38.352
<i>Skål.</i>

33:38.352 --> 33:39.269
Cheers.

33:43.315 --> 33:44.650
I cannot post this.

33:44.650 --> 33:47.027
The little dips look like piles of vomit.

33:48.362 --> 33:52.282
I cannot post vomit. People will see this,
and they will want to vomit.

33:53.325 --> 33:58.789
Okay. Um, well, the good news is,
it tastes a lot better than it looks.

33:58.789 --> 34:05.170
And this pita is, um, freshly made
at the bakery down the road.

34:06.171 --> 34:07.172
Feed it to me.

34:08.549 --> 34:10.801
Okay. Mm-hmm.

34:11.342 --> 34:14.888
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mm-hmm.

34:15.722 --> 34:17.099
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

34:17.683 --> 34:20.268
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

34:25.274 --> 34:26.275
Hmm.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.443
- Nate?
- Yeah?

34:28.443 --> 34:31.864
Can we please leave?
I mean, the food is yummy,

34:31.864 --> 34:33.782
but it's just so dumpy and sad.

34:34.867 --> 34:37.369
Okay, look,
I know it might not exactly be cool,

34:38.245 --> 34:39.871
but this place is important to me.

34:40.706 --> 34:44.835
This is where my family
celebrated our birthdays, anniversaries.

34:44.835 --> 34:47.629
It's where we came after I got promoted
as assistant coach at Richmond.

34:48.839 --> 34:52.676
Every important event in our lives
has been spent here.

34:52.676 --> 34:55.888
And, to me, that makes this place
even better than cool.

34:57.514 --> 34:58.599
Hmm.

34:59.766 --> 35:01.810
Oh, what am I thinking?
We should get the saganaki!

35:01.810 --> 35:03.687
Oh, I'm going to make a call.

35:03.687 --> 35:06.940
My friend has the flu.
And I have to check on her.

35:08.483 --> 35:10.819
No, that's-- No, that's very nice.
That's kind.

35:11.403 --> 35:13.322
Do you need all that stuff
to go make a call?

35:27.794 --> 35:28.795
All right.

35:33.926 --> 35:35.093
Sorry, mate.

35:36.136 --> 35:38.847
Still got to charge you for the booze.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.066
<i>And the final score is 4-0</i>

35:49.066 --> 35:53.862
<i>as the Richmond Ahabs are still unable
to catch their great blue whale.</i>

35:53.862 --> 35:55.906
<i>And without Zava, we're left wondering</i>

35:55.906 --> 35:58.492
if this team even belongs
in the Premier League.

35:58.492 --> 36:02.204
Well, without Zava, this team
doesn't belong in my church league, Arlo.

36:02.204 --> 36:03.830
It's actually a competitive league

36:03.830 --> 36:05.582
- with some very talented clergy.
- Boo!

36:05.582 --> 36:08.544
You're all a bunch of fucking wankers!

36:08.544 --> 36:11.046
McAdoo, you are shit!

36:11.046 --> 36:14.341
Without Zava, you're shit!
Even with Zava, you're shit!

36:50.043 --> 36:51.044
Hello, Doctor.

36:52.504 --> 36:55.716
Ah, yes. Yes, big loss today.

36:57.050 --> 37:00.429
Mmm. I did. I-- I just, uh, saw--
saw the announcement.

37:01.096 --> 37:02.514
Yes, extraordinary talent.

37:02.514 --> 37:05.642
Sorry, Doctor.
I'm-- I'm just in a little bit of a rush.

37:06.935 --> 37:08.729
That would be great. Thank-- Thank you.

37:15.652 --> 37:18.155
Ah. Okay.

37:20.741 --> 37:23.285
Right. Yes.
That's-- That's what I thought.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.831
Oh, it's-- it's definitely to be--
Bet-- Better to be sure.

37:29.958 --> 37:31.251
Yeah, well, thanks again.

37:32.377 --> 37:35.923
Yes. Yes, it was nice to see you
again too.

37:38.926 --> 37:39.927
Thank you.

38:18.257 --> 38:20.843
What? You actually dated a birthday clown?

38:20.843 --> 38:23.345
For three wacky weeks.

38:25.556 --> 38:29.351
Did you ever have sex with the clown?
Like, with the nose and everything?

38:29.351 --> 38:30.269
Of course I did.

38:32.229 --> 38:33.647
It was in his car, actually.

38:34.231 --> 38:36.942
All crammed in there with, like,
30 of his clown friends.

38:42.281 --> 38:45.534
God. Hearing about all your bozo exes,

38:46.076 --> 38:48.829
making me feel much better
about my last relationship.

38:49.746 --> 38:51.540
- Oh, the footballer, right?
- Yeah.

38:51.540 --> 38:53.458
Yeah. Jamie what's-his-name?

38:53.458 --> 38:58.130
No. Well, yeah-- No-- Um...

38:58.130 --> 38:59.631
The bad breakup?

39:00.924 --> 39:04.219
No. It was fun. Five stars.
Would break again.

39:08.056 --> 39:09.349
Hmm.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.351
Actually, it was, uh-- it was...

39:13.187 --> 39:15.522
No, I'm not gonna go there.
I'm not gonna talk about it.

39:16.148 --> 39:17.441
Because it still hurts.

39:18.108 --> 39:21.236
And I'm tired of feeling like that.
I used to be a happy person.

39:23.322 --> 39:26.867
- You seem happy to me.
- It's funny.

39:27.618 --> 39:29.369
I mean, not like fucking a clown funny.

39:31.371 --> 39:34.958
We spent all evening picking up, like,
50 kilos of lamb ka-poops.

39:36.084 --> 39:37.961
It's the most fun I've had in months.

39:37.961 --> 39:40.839
Oh, I have way more fun than this,
like, all the time.

39:40.839 --> 39:42.132
Oh, fuck off.

39:44.885 --> 39:46.011
Oi.

39:47.429 --> 39:49.014
Thank you for all of it.

39:50.098 --> 39:50.933
You're welcome.

40:02.152 --> 40:06.698
Shit. I'm so sorry.
I should not have done that.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.835
No, you absolutely should have.

40:32.724 --> 40:34.768
Baklava for two.

40:35.561 --> 40:37.187
Oh, yeah, um...

40:38.856 --> 40:41.108
My date had to...

40:47.155 --> 40:50.033
Yeah, I'm not gonna be able
to eat all that on my own.

40:52.327 --> 40:56.373
Unless you-- you'd care to join me.
No. No.

40:58.667 --> 41:00.002
Sure.

41:01.670 --> 41:05.382
After all, our baklava is divine.

41:07.718 --> 41:09.303
Yeah, I don't-- Um...

41:10.554 --> 41:12.598
For some reason,
whenever I'm trying to impress someone,

41:12.598 --> 41:13.891
I end up sounding like my gran.

41:14.766 --> 41:15.893
- Your gran?
- Mm-hmm.

41:17.227 --> 41:18.937
Um, okay, well...

41:21.148 --> 41:22.441
Take a seat.

41:37.414 --> 41:38.874
The only modicum of comfort

41:38.874 --> 41:41.502
is knowing that in all
the innumerable parallel universes,

41:41.502 --> 41:43.128
there is not one where we win that game.

41:45.964 --> 41:47.591
I know what Madchester is.

42:03.565 --> 42:06.443
Uh, hey, fellas. It's, uh, Henry.
Do you mind if I...

42:06.944 --> 42:08.070
Do your thing.

42:08.070 --> 42:09.154
Thanks.

42:15.202 --> 42:16.370
Hey, big guy.

42:16.370 --> 42:18.747
<i>Hi. Sorry about the match.</i>

42:18.747 --> 42:23.001
Oh, don't worry about that. It happens.
It's good to see you, man.

42:23.001 --> 42:26.088
Hey, um, look,
I've been really wanting to talk to you

42:26.088 --> 42:28.507
about what happened
at school the other day, you know?

42:28.507 --> 42:30.592
<i>Dad, I messed up.</i>

42:31.260 --> 42:35.055
<i>And if-- if I'd just followed your advice,
then none of this would've happened.</i>

42:35.681 --> 42:39.226
- What advice?
- <i>"If you're angry, count to ten.</i>

42:39.226 --> 42:41.228
<i>If that don't work, do it again."</i>

42:41.228 --> 42:42.354
Yeah.

42:43.188 --> 42:44.857
Well, that's something my dad used to say.

42:46.149 --> 42:47.985
Then Nana would tell him
that numbers were infinite

42:47.985 --> 42:50.153
just so she could deal with his snoring.

42:52.739 --> 42:53.907
Uh, is Doug all right?

42:53.907 --> 42:55.951
<i>I let him know that I was sorry</i>

42:55.951 --> 42:58.912
<i>by doing an apology rap
in front of the whole class.</i>

42:58.912 --> 43:00.205
Huh.

43:00.205 --> 43:03.458
Well, you know, a hip-hop song's
a great way to get across a message.

43:03.458 --> 43:06.253
You know? Just look
at the hip-hop song "The Message."

43:08.213 --> 43:11.550
Hey, guys. Good effort today.

43:12.384 --> 43:15.304
Mr. Higgins, is it true about Zava?

43:16.305 --> 43:17.472
I'm afraid so.

43:21.852 --> 43:23.103
Maybe some tissues for Dani.

43:23.896 --> 43:27.107
Hey, hey, guys. Zava just posted a video.

43:32.529 --> 43:37.284
<i>Hello. How are you? I'm just-- I have
to share something with you, my friends.</i>

43:37.910 --> 43:40.662
<i>You are not my followers.
You are my believers.</i>

43:42.206 --> 43:44.208
<i>And so it-- I have to tell you.</i>

43:45.667 --> 43:47.336
<i>Zava has played his last match.</i>

43:49.922 --> 43:52.591
<i>I will now dedicate all of my time
and all of my energy</i>

43:52.591 --> 43:55.886
<i>to my family and my avocado farm.</i>

43:56.970 --> 43:59.932
<i>If you put your energy
into the things you truly love,</i>

44:00.474 --> 44:05.103
<i>the universe puts its thing back into you.
You're welcome.</i>

44:08.565 --> 44:10.108
Um, hey, buddy.

44:10.108 --> 44:11.944
I gotta go talk
to the team here real quick.

44:11.944 --> 44:14.112
But then I'm gonna grab my stuff
and scurry home.

44:14.112 --> 44:16.949
And how about we hop online,
play a little <i>Roblox</i>? How does that sound?

44:16.949 --> 44:19.618
<i>You're on. Love you, Dad.</i>

44:19.618 --> 44:22.120
I love you too, buddy. I'm proud of you.

44:40.722 --> 44:42.599
He's okay. He's okay.

44:44.184 --> 44:47.521
He's okay. He's okay.

44:55.904 --> 44:57.072
Hmm.

45:02.703 --> 45:03.912
Gentlemen, hey.

45:04.621 --> 45:06.665
That was a tough one tonight. Okay?

45:06.665 --> 45:09.960
Man City has still got our number.
That-- That's all right.

45:09.960 --> 45:13.797
We're gonna get another crack at 'em
later in the season. Uh-huh.

45:13.797 --> 45:15.299
Coach, no practice tomorrow, yeah?

45:15.299 --> 45:18.260
- That's right.
- Okay. Well, I'll see y'all on Monday.

45:19.887 --> 45:21.263
Hey, hey. Hey, Coach.

45:22.264 --> 45:23.515
What about Zava?

45:24.308 --> 45:25.309
Um...

45:25.976 --> 45:26.977
He quit the team.

45:27.936 --> 45:30.647
I mean, technically
he retired from the whole sport,

45:30.647 --> 45:32.900
which makes it feel
a little less personal, yeah?

45:33.400 --> 45:34.902
You know, like if, uh,

45:34.902 --> 45:37.821
your girlfriend runs off with some dude
and it turns out they were soul mates.

45:37.821 --> 45:39.031
Oh. Yeah.

45:39.031 --> 45:40.574
Gina fucking Gershon.

45:40.574 --> 45:41.658
Right.

45:42.576 --> 45:45.787
Uh, but look, look, look, look.
I hear you, okay? Zava is gone.

45:45.787 --> 45:48.290
And you know what?
I think it's a good thing.

45:48.874 --> 45:52.961
- What? How?
- Well, I do. Okay, look.

45:52.961 --> 45:54.963
Do I wanna win? Heck yeah.

45:54.963 --> 45:58.175
But I also wanna do it
with folks that wanna be here.

45:59.510 --> 46:03.680
It's not like we could handcuff him
to his locker and make him love us.

46:03.680 --> 46:04.806
We could have tried.

46:05.682 --> 46:09.061
Hey, guys. Guys, look.
We got a good thing going here.

46:09.061 --> 46:10.562
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

46:11.897 --> 46:13.982
We didn't need Zava. Yeah?

46:16.860 --> 46:17.861
Yeah.

46:18.529 --> 46:23.116
All we need to win
are the fellas in this room right now.

46:24.284 --> 46:27.037
And all you fellas need to do
is believe it.

46:28.288 --> 46:30.541
- Whoa!
- It's a sign.

46:32.543 --> 46:33.836
That's it. We're doomed.

46:33.836 --> 46:36.588
We're done. We're done.
We're finished. We're finished.

46:36.588 --> 46:38.048
Now-- Now, hold on.

46:38.048 --> 46:41.134
Hey, knock it off, okay?
We're not doomed. No one is doomed.

46:41.134 --> 46:46.098
But, Bumbercatch, yes, you're right.
It is a sign. I agree. Yeah.

46:50.561 --> 46:53.272
In fact this, it's just a sign.

46:55.023 --> 46:56.316
All right, guys, listen to me.

46:57.276 --> 46:59.778
Belief doesn't just happen
'cause you hang something up on a wall.

47:00.571 --> 47:03.282
All right? It comes from in here.

47:03.282 --> 47:05.868
You know? And up here. Down here.

47:07.119 --> 47:10.747
Only problem is, we all got
so much junk floating through us,

47:10.747 --> 47:13.041
a lot of time
we end up getting in our own way.

47:15.460 --> 47:20.883
You know, crap like envy or fear, shame.

47:25.971 --> 47:28.223
I don't wanna mess around
with that shit anymore.

47:28.724 --> 47:30.726
You know what I mean? Do you?

47:30.726 --> 47:31.977
- No.
- No, Coach.

47:31.977 --> 47:33.270
- No.
- No.

47:34.479 --> 47:36.899
- Do you?
- No.

47:36.899 --> 47:39.401
No, me neither. Hell no.

47:40.152 --> 47:42.112
Well, you know
what I wanna mess around with?

47:42.863 --> 47:48.577
<i>The belief that I matter, you know?
Regardless of what I do or don't achieve.</i>

47:49.369 --> 47:53.582
<i>Or the belief
that we all deserve to be loved,</i>

47:53.582 --> 47:58.128
whether we've been hurt
or maybe we've hurt somebody else.

48:00.631 --> 48:04.468
<i>Or what about the belief of hope? Yeah?
That's what I wanna mess with.</i>

48:07.429 --> 48:09.181
Believing that things can get better.

48:09.181 --> 48:13.143
That I can get better.
That we will get better.

48:16.730 --> 48:20.609
Oh, man. To believe in yourself.
To believe in one another.

48:21.527 --> 48:25.072
Man, that's--
that's fundamental to being alive.

48:26.823 --> 48:31.495
And look. Yo, hey. If you can do that,
if each of you can truly do that...

48:38.085 --> 48:39.545
can't nobody rip that apart.

48:46.009 --> 48:49.471
- See y'all Monday?
- Yes, Coach.

48:49.471 --> 48:50.806
Thank you.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.814
- Tomorrow at 4:00 a.m.?
- Damn fucking right.
