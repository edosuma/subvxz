00:03.804 --> 00:07.141
[theme music]

00:08.242 --> 00:09.977
I don't care, Darlene.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.746
If Becky and Mark can come home
and sit through your father's

00:12.780 --> 00:15.716
stupid, boring,
dull, 25th reunion

00:15.749 --> 00:19.453
of his stupid, boring, god-awful
football team, then so can you.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.288
It'll be fun!

00:23.257 --> 00:25.559
See you later.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.561
Wait a minute.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.798
Herbs, spices, measuring.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.133
Why, this is some
kind of recipe.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.871
Yes, I wanted to do something
special because of Becky

00:37.905 --> 00:40.508
and Mark coming home,
so I'm making this here

00:40.541 --> 00:43.477
chicken Barbara Walters like
they got in the TV Guide

00:43.511 --> 00:44.545
this week.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.779
[kisses]

00:47.581 --> 00:48.916
Honey, don't get me wrong.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.085
I'm real glad Becky and Mark
are coming home for the reunion,

00:51.119 --> 00:53.487
but I'm just worried
things get a little tense

00:53.521 --> 00:54.455
when they're in the house.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.857
And well, the guys'll see.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.259
Oh, yeah.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.027
Well, I can understand why you
wouldn't want to be embarrassed

01:00.060 --> 01:03.531
in front of a guy who used to
eat French fries by sucking

01:03.564 --> 01:06.100
them through his nose.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.236
The reunion's a big
day for me, Roseanne.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.937
I don't get big days.

01:09.970 --> 01:13.374
I think in my whole life,
I've had a total of three.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.476
What's that, when
the kids were born?

01:15.509 --> 01:16.310
Six.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.986
I suppose one of those
is our wedding day, huh?

01:26.019 --> 01:28.922
OK, so I don't
count specific days.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.124
But tomorrow's going
to be a biggie,

01:30.158 --> 01:31.825
and I know you're going to
get in a fight with Mark

01:31.859 --> 01:32.726
and wreck it.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.996
Becky and Mark just pulled up!

01:36.029 --> 01:38.466
I am not going
to fight with Mark,

01:38.499 --> 01:41.034
because I want Becky to come
home and visit more often.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.803
So I'm just going to
hold it in all weekend.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.806
No matter what stupid
thing Mark says,

01:45.839 --> 01:47.675
I'm just going to ignore it.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.942
You can do that?

01:48.976 --> 01:51.044
You can be nice to Mark?

01:51.078 --> 01:52.613
Dan, whether you
realize it or not,

01:52.646 --> 01:55.015
I'm actually a very
forgiving person, you know?

01:55.048 --> 01:56.684
Didn't I forgive
you for not picking

01:56.717 --> 01:59.220
me up from work two weeks ago?

01:59.253 --> 02:00.221
No, you haven't.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.156
Well, why should I?

02:02.190 --> 02:03.191
BECKY: I wasn't gonna speed.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.592
I just want to get
here by dinnertime.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.627
MARK: Well, I didn't know they
had a dinnertime at this house.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.162
I thought it just
grazing 24 hours a day.

02:12.233 --> 02:17.137
Breathe in, breathe out.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.639
Hi.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.607
Hey!

02:19.640 --> 02:20.708
Happy reunion, dad.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.075
You're here.
Mm!

02:22.109 --> 02:23.076
Mark, hi!

02:23.110 --> 02:24.578
Boy, I missed you.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.546
Hi!

02:25.579 --> 02:27.681
Dan, it's Mark.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.317
Hey, good to see you.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.318
Same here.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.852
Hey, Deej.
You got bigger.

02:31.885 --> 02:32.953
I'm in puberty.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.857
You ever heard of it?

02:36.890 --> 02:38.226
Hey, how was the drive?

02:38.259 --> 02:40.060
Well, we would have got here
sooner if we hadn't stopped

02:40.093 --> 02:40.994
at the Colonel's for chicken.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.934
So you already ate?

02:46.967 --> 02:49.102
Well, Mark couldn't
wait anymore.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.804
You guys didn't go to
any trouble, did you?

02:50.838 --> 02:51.939
Oh, no, no.

02:51.972 --> 02:52.840
Not at all.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.074
No.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.142
Well, I was hoping we
could all sit in the kitchen

02:55.175 --> 02:56.143
and catch up.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.445
OK, that's a good idea.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.381
Um, I'm just go out there
and clear the table.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.588
Well, while we're waiting, why
don't we just sit here and rest

03:07.621 --> 03:09.189
our bones for a minute?

03:09.223 --> 03:12.660
[crashing from kitchen]

03:12.693 --> 03:16.297
OK, table's clear.

03:16.330 --> 03:20.200
[theme music]

03:57.671 --> 04:01.041
[laughs]

04:04.678 --> 04:07.948
So Dan, Perry Watkins
must not be coming if they

04:07.981 --> 04:09.082
asked you to make the speech.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.651
Well, maybe they asked
me to make the speech,

04:10.684 --> 04:12.686
because I'm the only one
whose uniform still fits.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.555
Yeah, and better
than ever too, honey.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.024
Because remember how you used
to have to stuff it with all

04:17.057 --> 04:21.329
them pads, and socks,
and everything?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.030
Who's Perry Watkins?

04:23.063 --> 04:25.198
He's this guy from
high school that your dad

04:25.232 --> 04:27.034
was very competitive with.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.002
He's not a guy I
was competitive with.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.171
He's a guy I was better than.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.107
Tomorrow night we're going
to show him it's still true.

04:34.141 --> 04:36.076
Don't you worry
about nothing, pa.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.278
Me and the youngins
gonna do you real proud.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.554
I'ma put in my new,
white, store-bought teeth,

04:46.587 --> 04:51.959
and nobody's gonna mention
that DJ was born with a tail.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.228
Dad, I want to help make
your party really great.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.163
Thanks, son.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.765
At least somebody
in this family's

04:57.798 --> 05:00.100
sticking up for the old man.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.635
I brought up
all those TV trays

05:01.669 --> 05:03.871
and arranged them
around the living room.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.739
Then I moved around
the chairs so people

05:05.773 --> 05:07.174
have more room to talk.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.076
Well, isn't that handy?

05:09.109 --> 05:10.844
Just as your football
buddies show up,

05:10.878 --> 05:12.913
your son has
discovered his passion

05:12.946 --> 05:14.515
for interior decorating.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.155
You know, Deej, tomorrow's an
important night for mom, too,

05:22.189 --> 05:23.957
so we're going to
let her take all

05:23.991 --> 05:26.059
the credit for the decorating.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.529
OK.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.531
Hey, dad.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.932
Why don't you practice
your speech on us?

05:31.965 --> 05:33.100
- No, no.
- Yeah.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.435
Oh, come on.
- Oh, you don't want to hear it.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.403
I want to hear it, dad.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.437
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.771
[interposing voices]

05:37.805 --> 05:39.206
All right.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.241
Ain't-- ain't much for
speechifying, you know?

05:41.274 --> 05:43.110
[laughter]

05:43.143 --> 05:44.945
[clears throat].

05:44.978 --> 05:49.650
25 years ago on this same field,
a bunch of guys got together"--

05:49.683 --> 05:53.787
Sit down, you bum.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.024
"--to play a little
game we call football."

05:57.057 --> 05:59.760
Bring on the pompom broads!

05:59.793 --> 06:00.894
Come on.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.396
Oh, we're just being
the audience for you,

06:02.430 --> 06:03.363
you know, to rehearse.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.264
Cut it out.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.534
God.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.035
"Little did they know
that they would--"

06:08.068 --> 06:09.336
Show us your boobs!

06:12.139 --> 06:18.011
"Little did they
know that they

06:18.045 --> 06:19.680
would be honored here today.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.484
Now let's go kick some
butt in the second half!"

06:23.517 --> 06:24.685
Uh, is that it?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.253
That's the whole speech?

06:26.286 --> 06:28.121
Yeah.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.557
Well, yay!

06:29.590 --> 06:31.925
[cheers and applause]

06:31.959 --> 06:34.795
Hey, Dan, what is
that on your forehead?

06:34.828 --> 06:35.696
What?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.898
Wait, is that a pimple?

06:37.931 --> 06:39.399
Oh, man.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.769
Ooh, man.

06:41.802 --> 06:42.703
Aw, man.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.171
No, it's not that bad, Dan.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.272
You can hardly notice it.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.512
Quit staring at my forehead.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.681
Hey, don't you go
fooling with that now.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.749
It's not going to be ready until
Sunday, and then it's mine!

06:59.352 --> 07:01.421
OK, Becky, I'm ready to go.

07:01.455 --> 07:04.057
I think I want to stay here.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.158
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

07:10.163 --> 07:12.099
What?

07:12.132 --> 07:13.634
I just want to spend
some time with my family.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.135
[scoffs] What
about my friends?

07:15.168 --> 07:16.403
I haven't seen them in a year.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.971
Well, you should have
taped it when they were

07:18.005 --> 07:19.072
on "America's Most Wanted."

07:21.909 --> 07:24.011
So what, you're just
not going to show up now?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.579
You go out without
me all the time, Mark.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.981
Why should tonight
be any different?

07:28.015 --> 07:34.021
Fine, I'll go alone, and I'll
have a better time without you.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.889
[door opens]

07:38.892 --> 07:40.260
[door closes]

07:43.731 --> 07:45.899
Um, Becky, are you OK?

07:45.933 --> 07:46.734
I'm going to go unpack.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.607
Did you hear that?

07:53.641 --> 07:55.509
He's cheating on her.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.710
Cheating on her?

07:56.744 --> 07:59.146
All she said was
he goes out a lot.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.414
Oh, so where do
you suppose he goes?

08:01.448 --> 08:03.116
He's certainly not
going out to think.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.056
She's a married woman now.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.223
She's got to make
her own choices.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.559
You know, you get in
the middle of this,

08:11.592 --> 08:13.493
it's just going
to make it worse.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.795
Well, I got to do something.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.196
Well, what are
you going to do?

08:16.229 --> 08:19.299
I'm gonna go pop Dan's zit.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.801
I thought you said
it wasn't ready.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.935
Tough.
I am!

08:29.476 --> 08:34.014
Well, there goes four hours
of my life I'll never get back.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.515
It was cool seeing
all your dad's friends

08:35.549 --> 08:37.951
again after all these years.

08:37.985 --> 08:42.623
Yeah, they sure have changed
a lot since before I was born.

08:42.656 --> 08:47.094
Hard to believe your dad's the
one who didn't let himself go.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.997
I think Darlene should
have to help with the party.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.732
Well, gee, I'd love
to, Deej, but I've

08:51.765 --> 08:53.033
got to leave in, like, an hour.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.635
So that means I have
to go lie in my bed

08:54.668 --> 08:57.738
and stare at the clock.

08:57.771 --> 09:01.174
Well, we all contribute
in our own way.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.910
What's my job at the party?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.044
Coats.

09:04.077 --> 09:07.080
Take them in my bedroom,
and put them on the bed,

09:07.114 --> 09:08.649
and don't go
through the pockets.

09:08.682 --> 09:09.983
Oh, Dan.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.085
Who remembers the time nobody
straightened out my nose,

09:12.119 --> 09:13.153
and I had to do it myself.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.054
Talk about painful.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.923
Hey, that's nothing, Dan.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.626
Remember the time I played that
entire second half of the West

09:18.659 --> 09:20.861
game with a dislocated shoulder?

09:20.894 --> 09:21.962
Now, that's pain.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.064
One time I went
to the hospital,

09:24.097 --> 09:26.299
and they ripped open
my stomach, and they

09:26.333 --> 09:29.469
took a human being out of me.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.476
Welcome to the Conner Castle.

09:36.509 --> 09:37.510
Make yourselves at home.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.346
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.616
Yes, check your coats
with, uh, DJ here.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.384
DJ's going to be a
heck of a player someday.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.292
Check out Barry.

09:52.325 --> 09:56.329
Get a load of that
big, bald head of his.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.865
Yeah, I bet nobody
would have noticed

09:57.898 --> 09:59.867
if he would have just worn a
great, big Band-Aid over it.

10:05.272 --> 10:09.542
Hey, did you notice that
Becky and Mark didn't

10:09.576 --> 10:10.878
sit together at the game?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.646
Yes, I did.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.848
And did you notice that I
didn't say one thing to them?

10:14.882 --> 10:15.749
I did.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.917
And I'm very proud of you.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.652
For once, you acted
like a normal person.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.754
Yes, a normal person.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.123
It's all part of my plan.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.892
What are you talking about?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.493
Well, what usually
happens, right,

10:26.526 --> 10:28.428
is that Mark does something
really mean to Becky,

10:28.461 --> 10:31.464
and then I yell at Mark, and
then instead of hating Mark,

10:31.498 --> 10:33.867
Becky ends up hating me.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.268
So what are you going to do?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.770
Nothing.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.238
I'm just going to make
sure that she knows

10:38.271 --> 10:39.439
that I'm here for
her, and I'm going

10:39.472 --> 10:40.974
to wait for her to come to me.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.611
And until then, I am
not going to meddle,

10:44.644 --> 10:47.380
I am not going to
get involved at all.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.281
Mom, look.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.083
Somebody gave me a tip.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.819
Oh, yeah, like all
you need is something

10:51.852 --> 10:54.354
else to stunt your growth.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.655
Stop it, all right, Becky?

10:55.689 --> 10:58.091
Fine, go ahead and go then.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.461
[door opens and closes]

11:01.494 --> 11:05.699
Um, Becky?

11:05.733 --> 11:06.633
Becky?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.736
I want you to know
that, you know,

11:08.769 --> 11:12.039
I'm here for you if
there's anything that you

11:12.072 --> 11:13.941
would like to share with me.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.776
No, mother, there's nothing
I want to share with you.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.011
You think I can't
run my own life?

11:18.045 --> 11:19.913
No, this is just
something new,

11:19.947 --> 11:21.782
you know, that I'm
doing with all the kids.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.056
DJ, is there anything that
you'd like to share with me?

11:29.089 --> 11:31.825
Yes, I think I should get
paid for carrying the coats,

11:31.859 --> 11:32.826
because Darlene gets paid--

11:32.860 --> 11:36.196
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
go back to work.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.098
You call that acting
like a normal person?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.466
You about blew it with Becky.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.868
No, I did not.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.635
I was laying the groundwork.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.437
She knows the door's open.

11:44.471 --> 11:48.876
Next time Mark acts like a jerk,
she'll walk right through it.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.511
It's part of my long-range plan.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.146
You know, it's possible
that Becky and Mark

11:53.180 --> 11:54.147
aren't going to break up.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.148
Oh, yes they will.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.584
How do you know that?

11:57.617 --> 11:58.518
Because it's the plan.

12:01.755 --> 12:07.594
Mom, if I was to leave
Mark, would you guys

12:07.627 --> 12:10.130
let me move back in here?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.765
Of course we would, Becky.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.066
We'd have room for you.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.667
Because you know,
I was just asking

12:14.701 --> 12:15.969
for the sake of discussion.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.337
Oh, yeah, I knew that.
Yeah.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.171
Hm.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.351
Great party, huh?

12:31.384 --> 12:34.154
Yeah, there's more big, fat,
smelly people in this house

12:34.187 --> 12:36.790
than I remember.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.292
God, it's weird
being back in here.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.161
What's with these dolls anyways?

12:41.194 --> 12:43.096
Oh, mom's redecorating
her room to make it look

12:43.130 --> 12:44.497
like we had a happy childhood.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.903
Hey, if you and
Mark were sleeping

12:49.937 --> 12:52.572
in here last night, how come
the beds aren't pushed together?

12:52.605 --> 12:54.374
It's not like we have to
do it every night, Darlene.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.944
We're not animals.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.678
Oh, that's right,
Mark can use tools.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.517
So how's school?

13:04.551 --> 13:07.587
Great, I'm constantly stressed
out, I don't get much sleep,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.589
sometimes I get this
pain in my right eye.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.458
It could be a tumor.

13:11.491 --> 13:15.562
But at least I'm not here
with the Hindenburgs.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.197
I mean, there's
good stuff too, right?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.866
Like, I'm sure you've
got some great teachers

13:18.899 --> 13:21.101
and there's lots of cute guys.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.136
Becky, it's not like
you're 100 years old.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.605
If you want to go to
college, go to college.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.009
Just don't go to my college.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.677
Could I ask you something?

13:30.710 --> 13:33.313
Yeah, what?

13:33.346 --> 13:36.183
Was it hard to leave David?

13:36.216 --> 13:39.452
I mean, did he take it bad?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.487
Well, you know, at first.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.455
But we worked it out.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.225
Man, that took a lot of guts.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.860
Oh, whatever.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.161
No, seriously.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.763
I-- I don't think I could
do something like that.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.599
I'm really proud of you.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.935
Ugh.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.270
Look, I can handle the
guilt of lying to mom,

13:57.304 --> 14:01.508
but I can't handle you
slobbering all over me.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.943
[sighs]

14:02.976 --> 14:08.916
Um, David isn't living
with his mom in Michigan.

14:08.949 --> 14:12.019
He's living with me in Chicago.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.320
You got to be kidding.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.587
No, I'm not kidding,
so you just got

14:14.621 --> 14:16.589
to keep your mouth shut, OK?

14:16.623 --> 14:18.959
Darlene, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

14:18.992 --> 14:21.494
This is serious stuff.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.363
Look, it's no big deal.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.065
But you're living together.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.733
You guys are having sex, right?

14:26.766 --> 14:29.169
No, I force him to sleep
naked next to me every night,

14:29.202 --> 14:30.037
yet I give him nothing.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.774
You think that makes me a tease?

14:34.807 --> 14:38.778
[sighs] Darlene, I know
that now you're in college,

14:38.811 --> 14:40.080
you think you know everything.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.682
But I'm just trying to give
you a little advice here.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.284
I just don't think
you should let sex,

14:44.317 --> 14:47.054
like, totally rule your life.
- You know, that's funny.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.222
That's the exact same
speech mom gave me,

14:49.256 --> 14:51.324
but you forgot to say "or
you'll end up like Becky."

14:57.764 --> 14:58.865
Yeah.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.167
Well, you know, Perry,
when you have a family,

15:00.200 --> 15:01.868
you put things in perspective.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.303
Hm.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.205
Hey, DJ, the old
man's over here.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.643
You never started a
family, did you, Perry?

15:10.677 --> 15:11.644
No.

15:11.678 --> 15:12.946
Funny thing about
20-year-old girls

15:12.980 --> 15:17.484
these days, they're just not
looking for a commitment.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.519
Well, when you're alone, I
guess you have the time to read

15:19.552 --> 15:22.922
all about that kind of stuff.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.324
Hey, son.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.994
Do you know what
Darlene just said to me?

15:27.027 --> 15:28.595
This is our youngest, DJ.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.264
He loves his big sister,
Darlene, don't you, son?

15:31.298 --> 15:35.635
Now, what did big
sis say to you?

15:35.668 --> 15:39.939
She misses me
and she loves me?

15:39.973 --> 15:42.942
[laughs] That a boy.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.145
Now you go run and help your
mom in the kitchen, tiger.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.346
Hey, Deej.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.380
[makes squirting noises]

15:48.381 --> 15:49.782
(WEAKLY) Puh, poo.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.660
All right, here's
a little something

16:00.693 --> 16:02.795
of interest to the happily
married couple, Jim and Sarah.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.064
Yeah.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.933
A list that Jim wrote
junior year of all the scores

16:06.966 --> 16:08.835
he made off the field.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.170
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:10.203 --> 16:11.438
Let's see that.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.339
Wow, yeah.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.675
Dan, your name is on there.

16:15.708 --> 16:19.046
And who could forget ol'
Chuck, our spiritual leader,

16:19.079 --> 16:23.116
who, in order to inspire
us, shaved off all the air

16:23.150 --> 16:25.152
he hadn't cut in three years.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.388
[laughs]

16:29.789 --> 16:32.659
Boy, Perry, that must hurt
just looking at all that.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.866
And here's a little
souvenir of Dan

16:39.899 --> 16:41.401
and Roseanne's first date.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.474
Oh, come on, Rosie.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.442
You had to know about this.

16:49.476 --> 16:52.879
Everybody else at school did.

16:52.912 --> 16:56.783
Wait a minute, those
aren't even mine!

16:56.816 --> 16:57.617
Who wants a brewski?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.956
Hey, Dan.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.358
These better be your
underwear, or you're

17:05.392 --> 17:07.360
in a hell of a lot of trouble.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.428
I stole them from my mom.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.431
Please don't tell her.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.201
Dan, we didn't have
sex till our second date.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.736
You've ruined my reputation.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.539
Honey, please, please act
like we're making up in here.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.408
Oh, yeah, honey,
I've been a bad boy!

17:21.441 --> 17:24.077
[laughs] I'm the worst.

17:24.111 --> 17:24.977
I'm the worst.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.246
I'm scum.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.980
Please, I'll give you
anything you want if you just

17:28.014 --> 17:31.918
walk back in there and act like
we have a nice, happy marriage.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.153
Fine.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.855
Then it will be two more
hours of my usual sweetness

17:35.888 --> 17:38.191
and light.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.228
And then you are
going to owe me bigger

17:41.261 --> 17:42.695
than you have ever owned me.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.963
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.666
[mumbles and kisses] Heh.

17:46.699 --> 17:47.934
Ha, ha.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.203
Yeah, I guess ol' Rosie
doesn't want anybody but Danny

17:50.237 --> 17:51.271
to see her, uh, undies.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.939
[laughter]

17:52.972 --> 17:53.973
I'm a lucky man.

17:54.006 --> 17:57.244
Oh, you are a lucky man, Dan.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.478
MARK: Don't walk away from me.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.413
BECKY: Go to hell!
- Shut up already.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.781
I'm sick of your mouth!

18:01.814 --> 18:03.583
I can't believe I married you!

18:06.519 --> 18:08.087
They're very active
in community theater.

18:10.623 --> 18:14.060
What am I going to do, mom?

18:14.093 --> 18:18.831
Well, Becky, help me to help
you make the right decision.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.768
Tell me all the rotten
stuff he does to you.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.671
Well, he's been in a bad mood
ever since he lost his job.

18:24.704 --> 18:28.308
We don't talk anymore unless
we're fighting about money.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.510
So I went out and got a
job, and he got mad at me

18:30.543 --> 18:33.112
for quitting school.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.013
He did?

18:34.046 --> 18:35.482
Yeah.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.484
You know that great apartment
I was telling you about?

18:37.517 --> 18:40.787
It's a dump.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.056
Yeah, and I suppose he
leaves you alone all the time,

18:44.090 --> 18:45.392
probably going out
with his friends,

18:45.425 --> 18:48.495
drinking, getting in fights,
and that type of thing, huh?

18:48.528 --> 18:49.829
No, he and his
friends are always

18:49.862 --> 18:53.065
restoring this old car that
no one's ever going to buy.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.901
You mean he's working?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.503
But I never get to see him.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.070
This marriage sucks.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.339
[sighs]

18:59.372 --> 19:01.441
Well, uh, Becky,
you know, I'm still

19:01.474 --> 19:03.576
waiting to hear the bad stuff.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.678
You know, tell me that he cheats
on you, or he beats you up,

19:05.712 --> 19:06.579
or something.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.549
I've got nothing here.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.585
Mark would never do that.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.454
Did he ever show your
underwear to his friends?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.858
I just wish that
we weren't married

19:18.891 --> 19:20.227
and we could go
back to the way we

19:20.260 --> 19:23.263
used to be when we lived here.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.664
OK.

19:24.697 --> 19:29.702
Um, so you want to get a divorce
so that you can date him, huh?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.238
It doesn't work
like that, Becky.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.206
I should've known
you wouldn't get it.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.574
No, I totally get it.

19:34.607 --> 19:38.044
Mark is out there working
his butt off to save money,

19:38.077 --> 19:41.981
so that his immature brat of
a wife can go back to school.

19:42.014 --> 19:42.882
[scoffs]

19:42.915 --> 19:44.417
Why are you getting so mad?

19:44.451 --> 19:47.387
Because you are
making me defend Mark.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.364
So just tell me.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.166
I suppose you still love him.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.634
Yes.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.103
And he loves you.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.339
[scoffs] What a day I'm having.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.709
But it doesn't help.

20:09.742 --> 20:13.045
We still fight all the time.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.815
Well, why don't we
just bottom the rest

20:15.848 --> 20:18.050
of this whole day out, OK?

20:18.084 --> 20:20.687
Why don't you and
Mark just move in here

20:20.720 --> 20:22.221
till you get on your feet?

20:22.255 --> 20:23.923
Oh, god, I don't know.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.459
I'm scared if we move back
in here, we'll never leave.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.361
No, trust me, I will make
sure that never happens.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.165
I guess I could
try to convince Mark,

20:33.199 --> 20:37.036
but he's going to be
really unhappy here.

20:37.069 --> 20:41.240
Oh, well at least there's
something in it for me.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.642
Thanks, mom.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.477
Are you going to have to
check with dad about this?

20:44.511 --> 20:45.945
No, Becky.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.014
I'm not going to have
to check with your dad

20:48.047 --> 20:50.317
about anything for a
very, very long time.

ON TV]

21:07.367 --> 21:09.902
I cannot believe that
they replaced that Darren.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.512
But it was a hit show.

21:19.546 --> 21:20.913
They knew they could
get away with anything.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.054
[sighs] Well, I like the
second Darren much better.
