00:30.502 --> 00:31.382
Happy Birthday!

00:43.352 --> 00:44.976
Excuse me...may I help you?

01:12.802 --> 01:15.392
Hi...
you okay?

01:15.974 --> 01:17.397
Yeah, yeah.

01:18.531 --> 01:19.691
No... I'm-I'm okay.

01:19.742 --> 01:20.599
You sure?

01:21.920 --> 01:22.900
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:24.727 --> 01:28.440
But I am never taking our kids to that damn arcade again.

02:14.381 --> 02:16.472
Bridge, come on...you have to eat.

02:17.016 --> 02:18.630
Bridgette, move it!

02:18.952 --> 02:22.331
I have to get to Hannah's,and Marie has to get to day care!

02:22.630 --> 02:23.704
Bridgette!

02:24.313 --> 02:25.849
But I don't understand.

02:25.918 --> 02:28.601
Mommy said we were going to the park today.

02:28.698 --> 02:30.005
I don't know what to tell you, kiddo.

02:30.056 --> 02:33.446
Mommy got a call early this morning and she had to rush to work.

02:33.497 --> 02:35.012
So you're coming to the office with me.

02:35.063 --> 02:36.873
But why can't I go with Ariel?

02:37.392 --> 02:38.926
Because you're not invited.

02:39.130 --> 02:40.614
Because I'm going to Hannah's

02:40.665 --> 02:43.060
and Hannah and I are going to dance class together.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.141
I'm in the car.

02:44.935 --> 02:46.195
But that's not fair.

02:46.582 --> 02:51.893
How come school gets canceled for teachers' conferences but not dance class?

02:52.060 --> 02:54.757
Probably to torture those of us who have to entertain you

02:54.808 --> 02:56.736
and drive you from place to place.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.875
The death of Amy Bannister is a tragedy.

03:00.274 --> 03:02.326
But the facts are the facts:

03:03.134 --> 03:05.980
Ms. Bannister, after an evening of drinking and drugging,

03:06.031 --> 03:09.528
chose to accompany my client back to his apartment.

03:10.402 --> 03:13.695
Unfortunately, that has now turned into a tragedy for both of them.

03:13.746 --> 03:17.890
And while it may titillate some people to think that something sinister happened that night,

03:17.941 --> 03:23.716
the sad truth is that my client was fast asleep when Ms. Bannister apparently entered the bathroom,

03:24.050 --> 03:28.783
slipped, cracked her head open on the shower door and summarily bled to death.

03:29.043 --> 03:29.870
Mr. Watt...

03:29.921 --> 03:31.153
Mr. Watt, Mr. Watt...

03:31.662 --> 03:33.525
you said in your opening statements yesterday

03:33.576 --> 03:36.187
that you're confident the jury will believe your client's version

03:36.238 --> 03:38.770
of the events and not the District Attorney's.

03:39.045 --> 03:40.517
How can you be certain of that?

03:40.568 --> 03:42.580
Well, my client's telling the truth.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.825
Look, Damon Hodges is a throwback to a time

03:45.876 --> 03:48.862
when the phrase "student-athlete actually meant something.

03:49.418 --> 03:50.060
Last year,

03:50.111 --> 03:52.928
he led his team into the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament

03:52.979 --> 03:55.209
and made the Dean's List both semesters.

03:55.723 --> 03:57.852
Now the District Attorney's decision to charge him

03:57.903 --> 04:01.086
using a case that relies solely on flimsy circumstantial

04:01.137 --> 04:04.693
evidence and hearsay smacks of election year desperation.

04:05.706 --> 04:08.637
I mean, there's got to be a better way to boost one's name recognition

04:08.688 --> 04:11.570
than falsely accusing our brightest and our best.

04:11.854 --> 04:12.876
Don't you think?

04:13.126 --> 04:14.584
Mr. Watt, Mr. Watt...

04:20.190 --> 04:23.125
Just a hunch, but I sense that man doesn't like you.

04:23.721 --> 04:26.864
Unfortunately, with this particular client,he has no choice.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.228
Why don't you folks go ahead in?

04:29.279 --> 04:30.871
I'll join you in a minute.

04:34.245 --> 04:36.691
Just between us,I have a witness who's about to testify

04:36.742 --> 04:40.794
under oath that Amy Bannister never touched a drop of alcohol in her life.

04:41.554 --> 04:43.464
I think it will be quite clear by the time I'm through

04:43.515 --> 04:45.653
that Mr. Wonderful drugged Ms. Bannister.

04:45.704 --> 04:49.831
He raped her,accidentally killed her and then force-fed her alcohol to cover his tracks.

04:49.882 --> 04:51.248
And you can prove that?

04:51.566 --> 04:53.578
With my crack team of young turks...

04:53.895 --> 04:55.211
Why, the Mayor nervous?

04:56.379 --> 04:59.641
Well, Attorney Watt is right about it being an election year,

05:00.186 --> 05:03.512
and people do prefer being associated with winners.

05:05.004 --> 05:06.806
Let's chat at the lunch recess.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.471
It's incredible how she does that.

05:12.522 --> 05:13.990
You don't even see her reach for the blade.

05:14.041 --> 05:17.059
You just look down and there it is,lodged in your gut.

05:19.443 --> 05:20.759
What is so fascinating?

05:21.336 --> 05:23.723
Nothing. I had this crazy dream last night,

05:24.100 --> 05:26.464
and she was wearing the same blouse in it.

05:26.968 --> 05:29.614
But it's okay, you were wearing a different tie.

05:29.665 --> 05:33.238
So, I'm sorry, you asked me to be here early for a reason.

05:35.108 --> 05:37.008
This young kid's something of a local celebrity,

05:37.059 --> 05:39.024
and juries are funny with celebrities.

05:39.075 --> 05:41.058
Sit with me today and watch 'em,

05:41.249 --> 05:43.256
see if you can tell which way they're leaning.

05:43.307 --> 05:45.160
That barracuda out there is right.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.577
It is an election year.

05:47.329 --> 05:50.273
If you're not getting a good feeling, I need to know that.

05:50.324 --> 05:51.994
See if perhaps I want to cut a deal.

05:52.045 --> 05:56.153
The government has approached 16 other design firms for bid-designs and proposals.

05:56.204 --> 05:58.713
My sense is, if we land this,

05:59.151 --> 06:02.423
it's a small piece of a much bigger, much more lucrative pie,

06:02.474 --> 06:06.356
a pie that this firm would love
to ultimately get the lion's share of.

06:07.001 --> 06:07.734
S o...

06:09.575 --> 06:14.892
let's sharpen our pencils,ladies and gentlemen,and reconvene...in 48 hours.

06:18.401 --> 06:19.591
He's kidding, right?

06:20.411 --> 06:23.656
48 hours to come up with a chip that can withstand that kind of temperature,

06:23.707 --> 06:26.154
those kind of G-forces and that atmospheric pressure?

06:26.205 --> 06:27.485
Hey, stop griping.

06:27.536 --> 06:29.934
Smaller, faster, cheaper -- that's what we do.

06:30.322 --> 06:31.025
Daddy?

06:33.268 --> 06:34.512
What's that thing?

06:35.149 --> 06:36.349
What thing is that, honey?

06:36.400 --> 06:38.664
That thing
you're talking about building.

06:40.775 --> 06:44.040
An algorithmic microprocessor component?

06:44.764 --> 06:46.090
Well, honey, it's...

06:47.815 --> 06:51.064
Well, in this case,it's a little machine that the government wants to use

06:51.115 --> 06:54.256
to help fix blurry pictures, photographs.

06:55.030 --> 06:56.614
You give it a blurry photo,

06:57.175 --> 07:00.599
and then it tells you
what the picture's supposed to really look like.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.495
Oh. Okay.

07:04.030 --> 07:05.595
Junior engineer in the making.

07:05.646 --> 07:06.408
Yes!

07:08.519 --> 07:10.145
Thank you for being so good.

07:10.632 --> 07:12.784
I know that meeting lasted a long time.

07:12.835 --> 07:15.245
Eh, it's okay,I was doing my picture.

07:15.580 --> 07:16.996
Oh, yeah? Let's see it.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.237
What is this, sweetie?

07:23.686 --> 07:24.510
You know.

07:24.561 --> 07:30.041
It's an al...gor... rithmic... Whatever that thing is.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.830
No, no, it isn't.

07:31.982 --> 07:32.897
Yes, it is.

07:32.975 --> 07:34.792
It's what you and your friends are making.

07:34.843 --> 07:37.338
At least that's what he thinks you're making.

07:37.389 --> 07:38.587
No, no, he doesn't.

07:38.641 --> 07:41.841
We're  making a microprocessor.
He knows that.

07:42.726 --> 07:45.006
It's part of a very,very small computer.

07:45.843 --> 07:46.945
Oh. Okay.

07:47.862 --> 07:50.548
Can we do the vending machine thing now?

07:50.884 --> 07:53.208
Ms. Staley, how well do you know Ms. Bannister?

07:53.259 --> 07:56.207
We've been roommates for over a year and a half.

07:56.348 --> 07:57.273
Were you close?

07:57.324 --> 08:00.212
I mean... some roommates barely see each other.

08:00.510 --> 08:04.560
I think it would be fair to say that we considered each other best friends.

08:04.768 --> 08:06.549
Best friends in college, anyway.

08:06.677 --> 08:10.861
So when you heard that your best friend, your...best friend in college, anyway,

08:10.952 --> 08:13.979
had gotten drunk and allegedly slipped in a bathroom

08:14.030 --> 08:17.265
and cracked her head open and then bled to death,
what was your reaction?

08:17.316 --> 08:18.805
Well, I knew that it was a lie--

08:18.856 --> 08:20.456
I knew that it couldn't have happened that way.

08:20.507 --> 08:21.595
Objection, Your Honor.

08:21.646 --> 08:23.676
The witness knows no such thing.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.256
Duly noted, Counselor.

08:25.643 --> 08:29.309
The jury will disregard the witness's claims oftain

08:29.583 --> 08:34.120
So... what was it about that scenario that gave you pause?

08:34.308 --> 08:36.820
Amy didn't drink. Not at all. Not ever.

08:36.876 --> 08:39.105
Really?
You're certain of that?

08:39.155 --> 08:41.835
Yeah, she hated drinking; she hated drugs.

08:42.202 --> 08:46.101
She would go to clubs because that's what college kids do,

08:46.150 --> 08:48.764
but she would only drink soda water.

08:49.253 --> 08:53.279
If they found drugs and alcohol in her system,she didn't put them there.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.217
No further questions at this time, Your Honor.

08:59.967 --> 09:01.661
Defense counsel,your witness.

09:07.912 --> 09:10.243
So it's your testimony, Ms. Staley,that,

09:10.431 --> 09:11.697
to the best of your knowledge,

09:11.748 --> 09:13.286
Ms. Bannister didn't drink.

09:13.449 --> 09:17.443
No. It's my testimony that Ms. Bannister didn't drink,period.

09:17.708 --> 09:19.564
Look, I applaud your loyalty to your friend,

09:19.615 --> 09:21.811
but the truth is, you don't know that.

09:21.867 --> 09:24.161
- I certainly do.
- I beg to differ.

09:24.534 --> 09:27.802
Just because Ms. Bannister may have told you she didn't drink

09:27.853 --> 09:30.553
- doesn't guarantee that on occasion, she may...
- Objection.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.593
Sustained.

09:32.057 --> 09:36.426
This court and the jury recognize that Ms. Staley cannot absolutely warrant

09:36.477 --> 09:39.345
that Ms. Bannister has never taken a drink, Counselor.

09:40.704 --> 09:42.204
Any further questions?

09:51.036 --> 09:51.636
Psst.

09:53.114 --> 09:53.991
Mr. Watt?

09:55.721 --> 09:57.354
Mr. Watt, I'm still waiting

09:57.405 --> 09:59.803
to hear if you have any further questions...

10:04.320 --> 10:05.939
Mr. Watt.

10:06.202 --> 10:07.912
He's stalling for some reason.

10:08.662 --> 10:09.989
Mr. Watt.

10:13.228 --> 10:14.628
My apologies, Your Honor.

10:15.632 --> 10:18.460
Um, and I have several more questions,if you please.

10:18.511 --> 10:19.920
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

10:22.599 --> 10:26.432
You knew Ms. Bannister very well, didn't you, Ms. Staley?

10:26.909 --> 10:30.648
- As I said, we were roommates.
- Do you know my client?

10:31.095 --> 10:34.760
No. I have heard of him,read about him.

10:34.954 --> 10:36.859
I don't know him personally.

10:38.340 --> 10:39.664
Well, do you like him?

10:41.026 --> 10:42.899
I... don't know him.

10:42.950 --> 10:44.366
But you don't hate him.

10:44.967 --> 10:46.209
I mean, you have no reason

10:46.260 --> 10:48.679
to lie here today,no reason to say anything

10:48.730 --> 10:51.319
that might prejudice this jury against my client.

10:51.370 --> 10:52.763
No, of course not.

10:53.008 --> 10:55.682
I mean,
it's not like you were jealous of him.

10:56.782 --> 10:57.826
Excuse me?

10:58.459 --> 11:02.917
Well, I mean, given...how he felt about Ms. Bannister, and...

11:03.465 --> 11:05.603
given how you felt about Ms. Bannister.

11:06.421 --> 11:07.325
Excuse me?

11:07.430 --> 11:09.471
Well, you were...in love with her...

11:10.235 --> 11:11.643
weren't you, Ms. Staley?

11:21.683 --> 11:22.952
Oh, my God.

11:23.261 --> 11:24.725
A simple "yes" or "no" will suffice.

11:24.776 --> 11:25.525
Uh...

11:31.578 --> 11:32.449
Oh, my God.

11:34.719 --> 11:37.955
Let the record show that Ms. Staley refused to answer.

11:39.175 --> 11:40.652
No further questions.

11:47.807 --> 11:48.674
Don't  look so shocked.

11:48.725 --> 11:51.341
You, of all people,should have seen that coming.

11:52.417 --> 11:53.509
Who deposed that woman?

11:53.560 --> 11:55.782
- I did. For seven hours.
- Seven hours?

11:56.872 --> 11:57.857
And in all that time

11:57.908 --> 12:00.648
you didn't think that perhaps Ms. Staley's statements might be colored by...?

12:00.699 --> 12:03.387
- No. No.
- Someone on Watt's team did.

12:03.716 --> 12:04.953
Happy Birthday.

12:12.242 --> 12:14.231
I  want everyone to pore over the witness list,

12:14.282 --> 12:17.635
review all the depositions, re-prepare all the witnesses if you have to.

12:17.686 --> 12:20.344
I can't have another witness torpedoed like that.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.329
- What?
- Lloyd's birthday.

12:23.380 --> 12:25.618
They wanted to be sure you had a piece.

12:25.668 --> 12:26.429
I can come back.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.698
No, no...Thank you, Sondra.

12:32.629 --> 12:33.733
I'm not losing this case.

12:33.784 --> 12:36.251
I may lose a few assistant district attorneys,

12:36.302 --> 12:38.020
but I'm not losing this case.

12:38.589 --> 12:40.679
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

12:41.063 --> 12:42.120
Thank you.

12:47.096 --> 12:49.475
For what it's worth, most of the jurors are still with you.

12:49.526 --> 12:50.183
Well, that's good to know.

12:50.234 --> 12:51.775
Unfortunately, I need all 12 of them

12:51.826 --> 12:53.277
if I'm going to lock this kid up.

12:53.328 --> 12:56.603
Did you happen to notice this woman sitting behind Attorney Watt?

12:56.654 --> 12:58.716
She was wearing a scarf on her head.

12:58.997 --> 12:59.709
You hungry?

13:00.688 --> 13:02.666
Right before Watt went in for the kill,

13:02.717 --> 13:05.537
she leaned forward and whispered something to one of his assistants.

13:05.588 --> 13:08.883
Private detective? Friend of the defendant?

13:11.613 --> 13:12.447
Damn it.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.833
I don't... I don't know what to tell you, Allison.

13:14.884 --> 13:17.900
You think it's important? Should I have someone look into it?

13:17.951 --> 13:19.275
The Mayor on line one.

13:19.561 --> 13:20.583
Of course he is.

13:23.180 --> 13:24.262
Court resumes tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

13:24.313 --> 13:26.083
- Can you be there?
- Of course.

13:26.134 --> 13:26.923
Thank you.

13:29.526 --> 13:30.456
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

13:36.329 --> 13:38.949
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.484
- That's a lovely blouse.
- Thanks. It's new.

14:49.828 --> 14:50.429
I'm confused.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.413
- You didn't actually see a man with a gun?
- No.

14:54.413 --> 14:55.888
And yet you felt compelled to scream,

14:55.949 --> 14:57.807
"There's a man with a gun in the elevator"?

14:57.858 --> 14:59.120
Apparently so.

14:59.679 --> 15:01.637
Were you expecting a man with a gun?

15:01.688 --> 15:02.530
No.

15:03.075 --> 15:04.615
I made a terrible mistake.

15:05.562 --> 15:09.202
Are you currently on any kind of prescription medication, Mrs. Dubois?

15:09.400 --> 15:15.315
Chief Parker... I recognize that this false alarm was a major inconvenience to you and your staff,

15:15.366 --> 15:17.996
me and my staff,but it's clear to me

15:18.047 --> 15:21.144
that what we're looking at here is a result of a simple mistake in judgment.

15:21.195 --> 15:23.261
Well, that's very understanding of you, Mr. District Attorney,

15:23.312 --> 15:25.677
but I still have to explain to my bosses on the City Council

15:25.728 --> 15:27.968
why a person would yell "gun" when there is no gun

15:28.019 --> 15:29.929
or pull a fire alarm when there is no fire.

15:29.980 --> 15:32.291
And I have every confidence you'll find a way to do that,

15:32.342 --> 15:33.540
but if you run into any trouble,

15:33.591 --> 15:36.349
be sure to have the people you answer to call me.

15:36.466 --> 15:38.029
- But, Mr. District...
- Thank you, Chief.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.586
Now do we have the all clear to go back in?

15:41.983 --> 15:43.307
Yeah, we're all clear.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.280
- I'm sorry, Chief.
- Thank you, Chief.

15:50.198 --> 15:51.593
What is so funny?

15:52.791 --> 15:55.357
Just  imagining the headline in tomorrow's paper.

15:55.660 --> 15:58.148
"D.A. Burned in Court,Not in Office."

15:58.199 --> 15:59.346
I'm so terribly sorry.

15:59.397 --> 16:01.233
I don't even know where to begin.

16:01.284 --> 16:04.612
It's okay. I take it this had something to do with a dream?

16:05.272 --> 16:06.769
Excuse me, Mr. District Attorney.

16:06.820 --> 16:07.523
Excuse me.

16:09.721 --> 16:11.867
Are you the one who pulled the alarm ?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.036
This is for you.

16:17.383 --> 16:18.662
$500?

16:22.267 --> 16:23.961
$500!

16:24.012 --> 16:26.227
I'll pay for it. We'll take it out of my money.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.245
Your money, my money,it's all...

16:30.324 --> 16:32.158
Wait a second, I mean, can't we appeal this?

16:32.209 --> 16:34.076
Well, we can, but we'd lose.

16:35.143 --> 16:36.761
It was a stupid dream when I dreamt it.

16:36.812 --> 16:38.939
I didn't even mention it 'cause it seemed so silly,

16:38.990 --> 16:41.653
but all the pieces seemed to come together.

16:42.763 --> 16:44.149
I was so certain.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.919
Okay, fine. Well, I'll just add it to the list

16:46.970 --> 16:49.185
of all the other bills we can't figure out how to pay.

16:49.236 --> 16:50.143
I'm sorry.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.523
- Who is it?
- It's me.

16:54.466 --> 16:56.038
Hey, it's my work buddy.

16:56.337 --> 16:57.913
What you got there, Pumpkin?

16:57.973 --> 17:01.426
- It's a picture.
- A picture of what?

17:01.689 --> 17:04.537
- Daddy's work.
- Daddy's what?

17:04.833 --> 17:08.409
His bomb. He and his friends are making it at work.

17:09.135 --> 17:11.717
Bridge, I told you Daddy is not making a bomb.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.429
Daddy is making an algorithmic microprocessor component, remember?

17:15.827 --> 17:17.228
Whatever you say.

17:17.565 --> 17:21.867
- Who's going to tuck me in?
- Could we not?

17:21.919 --> 17:23.686
I promised her I'd put it up.

17:25.436 --> 17:28.193
So where do you think she came up with something like this?

17:28.243 --> 17:29.702
She's a kid.
Who knows?

17:31.036 --> 17:32.983
So this component you're working on --

17:33.034 --> 17:34.910
what exactly is it a component of?

17:34.961 --> 17:35.909
I have no idea.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.745
It could be the component of a lot of things,

17:37.796 --> 17:41.728
but one thing I'm reasonably certain of it isn't a component of a bomb.

17:42.469 --> 17:43.680
And how are you so sure?

17:43.731 --> 17:46.293
Because, my dear, my company doesn't make bombs.

17:46.344 --> 17:47.877
We're an aeronautical firm, remember?

17:47.928 --> 17:49.830
As in airplanes and gliders and spaceships.

17:49.881 --> 17:51.289
Not things that go boom.

17:53.159 --> 17:53.759
What?

17:53.760 --> 17:56.090
Nothing. It's just...

17:56.881 --> 18:00.503
I'm not the only person who gets feelings in this house, you know?

18:01.655 --> 18:05.994
If you don't know what it is you're building, you might think about asking somebody, that's all.

18:06.045 --> 18:08.038
Okay, I'll add that to my to-do list.

18:08.089 --> 18:13.133
Since I have to be up in six hours, you'll understand if it doesn't go right to the top.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.614
You okay?

18:30.560 --> 18:34.684
Fine. It's just this stupid dream

18:59.689 --> 19:03.045
Ah, so that's who you are.

19:07.532 --> 19:08.638
You're kidding me.

19:09.256 --> 19:11.144
Watt hired a psychic of his own?

19:11.224 --> 19:13.974
A pretty good one, too, according to her Web site.

19:15.315 --> 19:19.757
Supposedly, she's been working with the Albuquerque police on missing persons cases for years.

19:19.808 --> 19:22.058
Although they won't corroborate that on the record.

19:22.109 --> 19:25.389
Supposedly, even the FBI calls her for a consult every once in a while...

19:25.440 --> 19:27.406
although they, too, won't corroborate.

19:27.457 --> 19:31.779
She's worked missing persons, kidnapping cases, serial killers, you name it.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.080
She's even written a book.

19:33.131 --> 19:36.146
- According to her Web site.
- According to her Web site.

19:36.197 --> 19:37.674
Dueling psychics.

19:38.839 --> 19:41.643
This just might be a first for the American justice system.

19:41.694 --> 19:42.724
I don't get it.

19:43.219 --> 19:44.451
You aren't concerned?

19:44.524 --> 19:46.502
Don't take this the wrong way, but for the most part,

19:46.553 --> 19:50.828
recent false alarms notwithstanding, I believe in you.

19:51.589 --> 19:54.029
I believe you believe everything you tell me.

19:54.130 --> 19:57.366
And I'm astonished at how often you're right.

19:58.085 --> 20:01.202
But I also believe that people like you are extraordinarily rare.

20:01.253 --> 20:05.136
So, am I worried about some woman who advertises in the newspaper?

20:08.628 --> 20:09.955
I believe in the justice system.

20:10.006 --> 20:11.222
I believe in the power of truth,

20:11.273 --> 20:14.283
and I believe in the wisdom and the fairness of juries.

20:15.092 --> 20:19.477
Randy Pilgrim has been a teammate of Damon Hodges for the last two years.

20:20.282 --> 20:22.060
In  about 20 minutes, he's going to testify

20:22.111 --> 20:25.598
that Hodges has a habit of putting GHB into women's drinks.

20:25.649 --> 20:28.382
Apparently, he's even boasted about it in the locker room.

20:28.433 --> 20:30.167
If my belief systems hold water,

20:30.218 --> 20:33.519
then Mr. Pilgrim's going to help me establish a pattern of behavior with this jury

20:33.570 --> 20:36.060
that's going to put Damon Hodges behind bars.

20:37.698 --> 20:39.740
Care to predict how it's going to go?

20:39.791 --> 20:41.137
One last question, Mr. Pilgrim.

20:41.188 --> 20:44.056
How do your teammates feel about you testifying today?

20:44.388 --> 20:46.232
Some of them weren't very happy.

20:46.460 --> 20:47.826
But I don't understand.

20:48.208 --> 20:51.491
If Damon Hodges is truly guilty of what's being alleged here today

20:51.542 --> 20:53.432
wouldn't they want to see him punished?

20:53.483 --> 20:55.725
Wouldn't they want him put away where he could pose

20:55.776 --> 20:59.004
no harm to their wives, their sisters,their girlfriends?

21:00.299 --> 21:03.927
Yeah, but... He helps us win games.

21:05.638 --> 21:07.298
No more questions, Your Honor.

21:13.891 --> 21:16.281
So if I understand your testimony accurately,

21:16.997 --> 21:19.008
my client, Mr. Hodges,

21:19.059 --> 21:23.576
has been boasting of drugging and taking advantage of women for months?

21:23.753 --> 21:25.338
Yes, sir,that's what I said, sir.

21:25.389 --> 21:27.519
- How many months exactly?
- Excuse me?

21:28.436 --> 21:31.189
What I'm asking you is how many months have you allegedly known

21:31.240 --> 21:34.854
that my client drugs women for the purpose of having sex with them?

21:35.159 --> 21:38.527
How many months was it that neither you nor anyone else on your team,

21:38.578 --> 21:41.785
for that matter,felt it necessary to call the authorities

21:41.836 --> 21:44.734
or tell a coach or tell anyone?

21:45.698 --> 21:46.527
Not until now.

21:46.578 --> 21:50.934
Objection. We've already established that Mr. Pilgrim did not come forward immediately...

21:50.985 --> 21:53.320
that there was enormous peer pressure to remain silent.

21:53.371 --> 21:55.325
- Sustained.
- Move along, Mr. Watt.

21:58.544 --> 22:00.908
You know my client pretty well, don't you?

22:01.591 --> 22:04.735
You played ball on the same team for a couple of seasons.

22:06.321 --> 22:08.594
Would you describe him as a handsome man?

22:11.446 --> 22:13.679
I don't know. I guess.

22:13.730 --> 22:16.174
Does he strike you as the type of man

22:16.225 --> 22:18.815
who would have to drug women to have sex with them?

22:18.866 --> 22:22.082
Objection. Council is calling for an opinion from the witness

22:22.133 --> 22:25.819
that is completely irrelevant and immaterial and inappropriate.

22:25.870 --> 22:28.448
And for which the witness has no expertise.

22:28.499 --> 22:32.357
Mr. Watt, if you don't have any substantive questionsfor this witness,

22:32.408 --> 22:34.394
I'm going to ask him to sit down.

22:34.786 --> 22:36.061
So what will it be, Mr. Watt?

22:36.112 --> 22:39.450
Because right now you are trying this court's patience.

22:40.985 --> 22:44.225
Have you any more substantive questions for this witness?

22:46.073 --> 22:47.309
Begging the court's indulgence.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.984
I'd like a minute to confer with my colleagues.

23:04.782 --> 23:09.780
If it please the court, the defense would like to present a few more questions to Mr. Pilgrim.

23:10.199 --> 23:13.042
All right, Mr. Watt, but mind your manners.

23:14.773 --> 23:16.039
Absolutely, Your Honor.

23:18.386 --> 23:23.869
- Mr. Pilgrim... do you hate my client?
- God, no.

23:24.350 --> 23:28.403
Come on...maybe just...just a little bit?

23:28.454 --> 23:29.905
Objection.
Leading the witness.

23:29.956 --> 23:32.572
- Mr. Watt...
- I'll hurry it along,Your Honor.

23:35.023 --> 23:37.295
Ever been to a Klan meeting, Mr. Pilgrim?

23:42.150 --> 23:44.396
I'm sorry, was that a "yes" or a "no"?

23:46.408 --> 23:47.638
You can't use that against me.

23:47.689 --> 23:49.454
Isn't it true that your Uncle Marshall,

23:49.505 --> 23:52.077
your father's brother, sits on the council...

23:52.128 --> 23:56.110
Objection.
Of what relevance are the associations of the witness's uncle...?

23:56.161 --> 23:56.995
Overruled.

23:57.501 --> 24:00.200
- The witness will answer the question.
- Which one?

24:00.251 --> 24:03.672
Have you ever been to a Klan meeting, Mr. Pilgrim?

24:05.417 --> 24:07.219
Not because I wanted to go, no.

24:09.139 --> 24:10.773
Was that a "yes" or a "no"?

24:14.691 --> 24:16.921
I've been to a Klan meeting, yes.

24:16.972 --> 24:20.430
My... my uncle took me, I was a kid.

24:20.882 --> 24:21.687
I was, like, six.

24:21.738 --> 24:23.812
It was some kind of picnic or something.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.523
But it wasn't like something I wanted to do.

24:25.574 --> 24:29.004
Let the record show that the witness answered in the affirmative.

24:29.108 --> 24:30.466
This witness is excused.

24:49.882 --> 24:52.419
I don't know what to tell you, boss. We're giving it our best shot.

24:52.470 --> 24:54.792
Tomorrow at noon, I guess you'll tell us.

24:55.801 --> 24:57.779
Right, that's easy for you to say.

24:58.381 --> 25:01.359
You think I don't know that what I asked you to do is impossible?

25:01.410 --> 25:03.065
No, I know you know.

25:03.330 --> 25:05.550
You're the best engineer in this building.

25:05.601 --> 25:07.227
Best engineer I've ever met.

25:08.188 --> 25:10.309
We just, we want to...we want to get this for you.

25:10.360 --> 25:13.643
We want to, uh...well, we don't want to let you down.

25:14.866 --> 25:18.254
- I appreciate all the hard work.
- Yeah, I appreciate the job.

25:18.998 --> 25:21.423
Oh, hey, you know what I've been meaning to ask you?

25:21.474 --> 25:25.571
Um, this algorithmic microprocessor, what exactly is it being integrated into?

25:26.206 --> 25:28.855
I mean, I understand it's a small part of a larger project,

25:28.906 --> 25:31.254
but what exactly is the initial application?

25:32.032 --> 25:34.466
- It's a government project, Joe.
- No, I know.

25:34.517 --> 25:37.158
I heard you say that yesterday. But I mean specifically.

25:37.209 --> 25:38.031
Specifically?

25:39.221 --> 25:41.232
Specifically for the first 18 months of its life

25:41.283 --> 25:44.351
my guess is that it will live on the nose of a missile

25:44.564 --> 25:47.031
for our own use or for sale to our allies

25:47.206 --> 25:50.775
and help guide it to its target so that innocent people won't get hurt.

25:50.826 --> 25:54.838
Shortly thereafter it will probably appear on home computers to facilitate

25:54.889 --> 25:56.564
personal video conferencing.

25:57.087 --> 25:59.467
A few years after that, my hunch is some clever fellow

25:59.518 --> 26:02.613
will use the technology in a child's game of some kind.

26:02.664 --> 26:04.307
Hopefully, it'll be a big hit at Christmas.

26:04.358 --> 26:07.562
Pay us a lot of royalties. That would be my hunch.

26:09.738 --> 26:10.688
Night, Joe.

26:15.145 --> 26:18.088
And then Mr. Newberry told Hannah that she should spend less time

26:18.139 --> 26:20.534
downloading music and more time studying...

26:20.602 --> 26:23.310
- Mom, I was still eating that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

26:24.484 --> 26:25.901
Are you even listening to me?

26:25.952 --> 26:28.892
- Honestly, I'm a little distracted.
- I noticed.

26:29.433 --> 26:32.184
There's something I need to do tonight and I need Daddy to watch you girls.

26:32.235 --> 26:34.292
- What is it?
- Oh, it's this lecture.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.628
This woman that I noticed in court, she wrote a book.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.600
And she's going to speak tonight downtown.

26:38.651 --> 26:40.674
- Sounds boring.
- Thank you.

26:40.725 --> 26:42.958
Hey...! Where's my picture?

26:43.345 --> 26:45.553
The picture I drew of Daddy's bomb.

26:45.717 --> 26:49.236
I was going to bring it in to school for show-and-tell.

26:49.427 --> 26:51.301
Daddy doesn't have a bomb, doofus.

26:51.352 --> 26:52.771
- Hey.
- Not yet.

26:53.049 --> 26:55.429
- Mom, tell her, please.
- You know...

26:55.480 --> 26:58.851
- Look, Daddy's home.
- Daddy!

26:59.352 --> 27:00.483
You're going to wake your sister.

27:00.534 --> 27:02.240
- Daddy!
- Sorry I'm late.

27:03.954 --> 27:04.554
Hi.

27:05.945 --> 27:07.887
I stopped and had a talk with my boss, and...

27:07.938 --> 27:10.167
Uh, Marie's asleep.I need a favor.

27:10.867 --> 27:13.145
- Will it hold?
- Uh, yeah, it'll hold.

27:13.375 --> 27:14.282
Okay.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.626
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Mom.

27:19.935 --> 27:24.153
"When little Autumn Mowry"was 13, she broke her neck diving into a pool.

27:24.811 --> 27:30.335
"At her funeral, her mother and her younger sister cried so hard they had to be hospitalized.

27:31.099 --> 27:33.214
"That... was in 1987.

27:33.994 --> 27:38.940
"When Autumn appeared to me in the year 2000,"she was practically screaming.

27:39.580 --> 27:42.460
"Her younger sister had been missing for three days.

27:43.124 --> 27:48.120
"The police suspected that Autumn's sister had been abducted by a janitor at her school --

27:48.597 --> 27:53.879
a man they realized was a registered sex offender who had lied about his identity.

27:54.743 --> 27:57.401
But Autumn told me differently..."

27:58.219 --> 27:59.658
What a load of crap.

28:00.023 --> 28:04.577
"Her spirit led me to an intersection on the outskirts of Albuquerque..."

28:05.047 --> 28:07.976
You had a sudden bout of diarrhea, you lying whore.

28:08.246 --> 28:09.628
If you hadn't been looking for a bathroom,

28:09.679 --> 28:12.110
you'd have never been caught dead in that part of town.

28:12.161 --> 28:15.025
Hey. Excuse me, could you keep it down over there?

28:15.143 --> 28:15.777
Shh! Shh!

28:15.828 --> 28:20.162
"And that's when I saw them..."standing in the gas station convenience store.

28:20.213 --> 28:23.952
"He was holding her hand. She looked terrified.

28:24.007 --> 28:26.910
I was buying her something for dinner, you lying whore.

28:26.961 --> 28:28.869
And she was smiling,by the way.

28:29.104 --> 28:31.857
Right up until the point where that police car came roaring up

28:31.908 --> 28:34.792
that you called and shot me three times in the head.

28:35.132 --> 28:38.586
"How do I explain these extraordinary encounters with the dead?"

28:38.806 --> 28:40.258
It's called a coincidence.

28:40.309 --> 28:43.109
and you've been dining off it for years, you fake.

28:43.575 --> 28:47.135
Can't wait 'til she gets down here to the hot zone where I live.

28:47.186 --> 28:51.378
Man, are there a lot of pissed-off souls down here that want a piece of her.

28:51.823 --> 28:54.468
"It is truly a gift."

29:16.985 --> 29:19.010
Hey, where are you going with that?

29:19.881 --> 29:22.629
- That's my work.
- This is not your work.

29:24.266 --> 29:28.954
You've never spent one single moment of your life contemplating how to hurt someone else.

29:29.976 --> 29:34.395
You knew the whole time. Didn't you, you witch?

29:37.939 --> 29:41.543
I remember being seven,I remember drawing pictures...

29:41.861 --> 29:44.872
seeing them come true...not understanding.

29:45.944 --> 29:47.675
I'm not going to quit, Allison.

29:47.726 --> 29:50.859
I can't quit. I got you, I got the kids.

29:51.669 --> 29:54.997
I got a mortgage and a stack of bills I can't pay already.

29:55.894 --> 29:57.014
I can't quit.

29:57.593 --> 29:59.229
Maybe your company won't get the contract.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.738
Maybe it'll all be moot.

30:01.369 --> 30:03.484
No, we're going to get it.

30:03.535 --> 30:06.393
I can feel it in my bones. We're going to get it.

30:08.091 --> 30:12.603
- How was the lecture?
- She was okay.

30:13.469 --> 30:15.402
Very interesting crowd.

30:32.060 --> 30:33.602
Excuse me, can I help you?

30:40.820 --> 30:43.401
What are you up to? What are you doing?

30:44.556 --> 30:46.954
You're killing everyone here, you know that?

30:48.153 --> 30:49.477
Why would you do that?

30:57.486 --> 30:59.306
Does it matter at all that the young man's guilty,

30:59.357 --> 31:00.807
that he killed this girl?

31:01.083 --> 31:05.409
It matters. But it's not the subject of this particular conversation.

31:08.633 --> 31:12.128
Look... I get in your face a lot and so does the Mayor.

31:12.657 --> 31:15.935
But we both like you. And we both want you to stick around.

31:16.420 --> 31:19.506
He wants you on the ticket. But you can't be there

31:19.557 --> 31:23.665
if this guy's going to make an ass out of you in that courtroom every day.

31:26.055 --> 31:30.068
I know. Same blouse.
Didn't get homelast night. Campaign season.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.943
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Ten after 1:00.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.796
You might have to walk with me.

31:38.035 --> 31:41.171
I spent some time last night with Olga Z., Watts' psychic.

31:41.258 --> 31:43.966
- The woman is a fraud.
- I don't know, Allison.

31:44.349 --> 31:45.797
Two days ago, I might have agreed with you.

31:45.848 --> 31:47.813
But she's kicking the stuffing out of me in that court.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.329
No, I don't think so, not her.

31:49.380 --> 31:52.464
Someone's giving Watt information we don't have, but I don't think it's her.

31:52.515 --> 31:53.445
Well, then who?

31:54.075 --> 31:55.626
I've been having this nutty dream lately

31:55.677 --> 31:58.220
which is the reason I pulled the fire alarm the other day.

31:58.271 --> 32:00.242
It's a massacre, here in the office.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.702
This shooter comes in, wipes everybody out.

32:03.149 --> 32:04.941
I was certain it was going to happen for real,

32:04.992 --> 32:08.002
but last night I realized,it was a metaphor.

32:08.631 --> 32:10.787
I'm sorry, I'm not following any of this.

32:10.838 --> 32:13.466
This new assistant district attorney, Elliot?

32:13.881 --> 32:15.163
He's holding the gun.

32:15.622 --> 32:18.867
Are you saying he's the one that's feeding Watt information?

32:18.918 --> 32:22.671
But he's only privy to what we're privy to -- the information in the depositions.

32:22.722 --> 32:25.399
In fact, he didn't even depose some of these witnesses.

32:25.450 --> 32:28.205
I can't explain it yet. I don't know how it works,but...

32:28.256 --> 32:30.661
Okay. Here's the walk with me part.

32:32.735 --> 32:36.441
Allison, I have to be honest with you, what you're saying doesn't...

32:36.657 --> 32:38.087
make a whole lot of sense.

32:38.138 --> 32:40.125
And unless you can fill in the blanks and do it quickly,

32:40.176 --> 32:43.219
I have no choice but to head over to Watt's office and try to cut a deal.

32:43.270 --> 32:45.670
- What?
- I'm on my way there now. I'm boxed in.

32:45.721 --> 32:48.474
Unless I can assure the Mayor that Larry Watt's not gonna

32:48.525 --> 32:51.341
catch me with my pants down again in court, I really have no option.

32:51.392 --> 32:52.280
You all right?

32:54.119 --> 32:55.475
What are you staring at, Allison?

32:55.526 --> 32:56.925
My metaphor, I hope.

33:03.141 --> 33:05.226
- Larry Watt's waiting for me.
- No, don't go yet.

33:05.277 --> 33:08.074
- I have to go.
- This woman matters.

33:08.451 --> 33:09.809
This woman is important.

33:13.085 --> 33:14.834
We have to go speak with her.

33:18.980 --> 33:20.086
Come in.

33:20.873 --> 33:23.098
- Elliot.
- Mr. District Attorney.

33:23.442 --> 33:25.194
I've asked you to come in, Elliot, because even though

33:25.245 --> 33:26.512
you've worked here only a short time,

33:26.563 --> 33:28.995
I've come to feel a certain connection with you,

33:29.046 --> 33:30.840
and I wanted to share something.

33:31.027 --> 33:34.893
Something that very few people other than Mrs. Dubois here know about me.

33:36.077 --> 33:39.390
Well, thank you, uh, I guess.

33:40.758 --> 33:42.082
I'm a psychic, Elliot.

33:44.598 --> 33:46.308
- Excuse me?
- I'm a psychic.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.920
I can pluck things from people's minds.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.506
For instance, even though you've never introduced us,

33:54.557 --> 33:58.489
I know that your fiancee works in Student Services over at Mesa University

33:59.248 --> 34:03.604
as a psychiatrist,I believe.

34:04.098 --> 34:06.537
- How am I doing?
- May I sit down?

34:06.588 --> 34:07.188
No.

34:08.795 --> 34:10.396
And I bet if I subpoenaed her records,

34:10.447 --> 34:13.609
I'd find that she met with young Amanda Staley,

34:14.359 --> 34:19.291
helped her cope with her heartache after she realized that she fell in love with her roommate.

34:19.342 --> 34:23.978
- If could just sit...
- I need you to stay right where you are.

34:26.947 --> 34:30.998
I'm also sensing that she met with Randy Pilgrim.

34:31.177 --> 34:35.960
Helped him deal with the guilt of growing up in a family filled with racists and worse.

34:36.011 --> 34:37.012
Am I warm?

34:38.726 --> 34:42.025
- I'm feeling a little faint,actually...
- Stay where you are.

34:42.076 --> 34:46.648
So Attorney Watt would come into the courtroom armed with all this information ahead of time.

34:46.699 --> 34:51.362
He'd put on a little act, pretend that the District Attorney was beating the pants off him,

34:51.414 --> 34:53.259
and then just in the nick of time,

34:53.310 --> 34:56.572
he'd get some new and explosive information from his psychic,

34:57.535 --> 35:00.253
all to convince us that he was unbeatable.

35:01.126 --> 35:03.842
All to convince us that we'd better make a deal.

35:04.084 --> 35:06.130
How much you make a year working for the city, Elliot?

35:06.181 --> 35:07.747
And what was Watt promising?

35:07.798 --> 35:09.565
About three times that?

35:11.169 --> 35:14.573
There are two options here, Elliot,and I want you to pick one.

35:14.686 --> 35:17.594
I fire you right here and now, report you to the Arizona Bar.

35:17.645 --> 35:22.799
They strip you of your license and you never work as a lawyer again ever, anywhere.

35:23.801 --> 35:25.043
Or option two:

35:25.480 --> 35:27.329
you help me even the score a bit,

35:27.380 --> 35:30.329
I still fire you, write a horrible letter of recommendation for your file,

35:30.380 --> 35:32.231
but with hard work in four or five years,

35:32.282 --> 35:36.164
you might get with a decent firm and be able to actually earn a living.

35:36.864 --> 35:41.160
Don't tell me. Don't tell me 'cause I'm guessing

35:41.211 --> 35:45.143
that you pick option number two.

35:46.041 --> 35:49.899
Mr. James, in your deposition, you described yourself as the team manager.

35:50.629 --> 35:53.458
And isn't it true that part of your responsibility

35:53.509 --> 35:55.936
was to pick up Damon Hodges at 6:30 every morning,

35:55.987 --> 35:57.999
make sure he was there for practice?

35:58.234 --> 35:58.862
Yes, sir.

35:59.037 --> 36:01.535
And isn't it fair to say that you enjoyed that part of your job,

36:01.586 --> 36:03.805
that you admired Mr. Hodges,

36:03.856 --> 36:07.480
found him glamorous, enjoyed being in his company?

36:07.652 --> 36:08.749
Yes, sir, I did.

36:08.962 --> 36:12.661
Now, in your deposition, you stated that you picked up Damon Hodges

36:12.712 --> 36:15.353
for practice on the morning in question at 6:30.

36:15.404 --> 36:18.338
And he confessed that he had a young woman over the night before

36:18.389 --> 36:21.074
who apparently had left in the middle of the night.

36:21.125 --> 36:23.569
You then go on to describe how Damon said

36:23.620 --> 36:26.360
he just needed to brush his teeth and headed into the bathroom,

36:26.411 --> 36:32.422
that you then heard Damon hollering, screaming for you to call 911.

36:33.104 --> 36:35.671
Isn't it true that when you were deposed by my office,

36:35.722 --> 36:38.499
we showed you these phone records indicating you received

36:38.550 --> 36:40.984
a phone call at 4:30 in the morning?

36:41.042 --> 36:43.450
A phone call that was made from a pay phone

36:43.501 --> 36:46.971
not three blocks from Damon Hodges' townhouse?

36:47.341 --> 36:49.086
A phone call that you repeatedly insisted

36:49.137 --> 36:52.583
was simply a wrong number and that woke you from a sound sleep?

36:53.477 --> 36:54.675
That's what I said.

36:57.379 --> 36:58.570
Is that the truth?

37:04.492 --> 37:05.924
No, it is not.

37:06.264 --> 37:07.610
- Objection.
- Overruled.

37:07.661 --> 37:09.757
You'll have your opportunity to cross.

37:09.936 --> 37:10.644
Proceed.

37:12.184 --> 37:16.552
The truth is it was Damon Hodges who called you at 4:30 that morning, isn't it?

37:17.760 --> 37:18.557
Yes, sir.

37:18.669 --> 37:22.371
And you went to his apartment at 4:45, not at 6:30.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.170
- Yes.
- Objection, Your Honor.

37:24.221 --> 37:27.123
- Counsel's leading the witness.
- Overruled, Mr. Watt.

37:27.722 --> 37:30.288
Now what really happened when you arrived there?

37:34.017 --> 37:35.207
I saw Amy Bannister.

37:36.520 --> 37:40.328
Damon told me that he brought her home to party, but she wasn't into it.

37:40.379 --> 37:43.821
She wanted to leave. They had a fight,and he pushed her down,

37:43.873 --> 37:45.935
she hit her head on the shower door.

37:46.205 --> 37:47.853
He said it happened really fast.

37:47.904 --> 37:51.251
He was scared and he wanted me to help him cover it up.

37:53.618 --> 37:57.500
We poured vodka down her throat and then waited until 6:30 to call 911.

37:59.247 --> 38:01.099
And what did you do until 6:30?

38:03.574 --> 38:07.146
We played cards.Damon wanted to play cards.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.382
No further questions.

38:14.578 --> 38:15.894
Mr. Watt, your witness.

38:22.311 --> 38:24.231
It's pretty interesting, Mr. James.

38:25.008 --> 38:26.811
You tell one story for months and months,

38:26.862 --> 38:29.830
you tell it to the police, you tell it in depositions,

38:30.515 --> 38:33.273
and then you get here in court and you change it.

38:34.267 --> 38:36.287
Why would you do a thing like that?

38:36.927 --> 38:39.144
I felt bad. I couldn't sleep.

38:41.572 --> 38:43.955
You couldn't sleep because you felt badly about lying before,

38:44.006 --> 38:48.021
or you couldn't sleep because you felt badly about having to lie today?

38:48.139 --> 38:49.776
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.523
Mr. Watt,if you're going to attack this witness's testimony,

38:52.574 --> 38:54.572
I need you to do it based on matters of record,

38:54.623 --> 38:56.498
not by restating the obvious.

38:56.549 --> 38:57.907
I apologize, Your Honor.

39:00.630 --> 39:04.515
Mr. Watt,are you going to proceed or shall we dismiss the witness?

39:07.281 --> 39:11.005
Mr. Watt,I need to know if you've concluded your cross.

39:19.376 --> 39:20.286
Mr. Watt?

39:22.723 --> 39:26.037
Your Honor, actually, I have several more questions for this witness.

39:26.088 --> 39:29.171
- We are all ears, Mr. Watt.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

39:33.547 --> 39:37.296
So you couldn't sleep and that's why you changed your story today?

39:37.374 --> 39:39.049
Yes, sir. I couldn't sleep.

39:39.421 --> 39:42.170
I couldn't study. I couldn't do much of anything.

39:42.221 --> 39:46.363
And you're sure this doesn't have anything to do with you father, Mr. James?

39:47.403 --> 39:48.425
How do you mean?

39:49.167 --> 39:52.246
Well, isn't it true that your father is staring at multiple felony charges

39:52.297 --> 39:53.621
filed by this district attorney?

39:53.672 --> 39:54.803
Objection: irrelevant.

39:54.854 --> 39:57.000
- Whoever this young man's father is...
- Overruled.

39:57.051 --> 40:01.209
For theft, for forgery, for credit card fraud,

40:01.260 --> 40:03.452
for the sale of narcotics to a minor?

40:03.503 --> 40:04.220
Objection.

40:04.271 --> 40:05.626
Overruled, Counsel.

40:05.677 --> 40:07.303
Get to the question, Counsel.

40:07.388 --> 40:10.711
And isn't it true that the sudden change in your story today

40:10.762 --> 40:15.674
has more to do with the District Attorney promising to go easy on good ol' dad?

40:15.725 --> 40:18.310
- I must object!
- Overruled.

40:19.064 --> 40:22.067
Remember, Mr. James, you are under oath.

40:22.798 --> 40:26.386
You are in a court of law and I am asking you a direct question.

40:27.243 --> 40:30.551
Isn't it true that the reason for changing your story today

40:30.620 --> 40:34.893
has nothing to do with my client nothing to do with the truth,

40:34.944 --> 40:39.916
nothing to do with justice, but has everything to do

40:39.967 --> 40:42.567
with your degenerate father and some understanding

40:42.714 --> 40:45.246
between you and the District Attorney here?

40:46.308 --> 40:47.878
- That is not true, sir.
- Oh, really?

40:47.929 --> 40:53.311
Are you denying that as we speak, your father sits in a cell in Prescott,

40:53.362 --> 40:55.309
awaiting extradition to Phoenix?

40:55.360 --> 41:00.609
Sir, my father's an appellate court judge in the Sixth District of the state of Missouri.

41:01.353 --> 41:06.645
Although, currently he's on temporary leave to work on a U.N. commission investigating aid to Africa.

41:07.197 --> 41:10.131
In fact, the two of you went to the same law school.

41:10.735 --> 41:14.134
He was a year behind you -- Bennett James?

41:15.971 --> 41:17.253
He said to say hello.

41:20.062 --> 41:20.726
Oh.

41:27.397 --> 41:29.283
Mr. Watt, is there any follow-up?

41:29.559 --> 41:32.234
Was there any basis to this line of questioning?

41:32.523 --> 41:35.101
You just attacked this witness ruthlessly,and I --

41:35.152 --> 41:37.858
and I'm sure I'm speakingfor these 12 jurors as well,

41:37.909 --> 41:39.499
would like to know why.

41:41.177 --> 41:43.399
Begging Your,Your Honor's pardon.

41:43.681 --> 41:48.023
Before proceeding, defense would like to take a moment to confer with the prosecution.

41:48.074 --> 41:49.474
This is highly irregular.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.032
Keep it brief.

41:58.746 --> 42:02.866
Hey, Manny, I got to believe there's some kind of a deal to be made here.

42:02.917 --> 42:05.105
You know, one that's good for everyone.

42:05.596 --> 42:06.618
What do you say?

42:07.450 --> 42:11.989
Me? I say manslaughter, minimum of 15 years.

42:12.963 --> 42:16.796
Don't look so shocked. You, of all people, had to see this coming.

42:23.216 --> 42:27.904
