00:06.571 --> 00:08.051
[whistle blows on TV]

00:08.095 --> 00:10.314
Come on, man! Air ball?

00:10.358 --> 00:13.970
At this point, I might as well
try out for the Lakers.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.408
Uh, Pop, didn't
you hurt your back

00:17.452 --> 00:19.062
brushing your teeth
the other day?

00:19.106 --> 00:21.108
That's because
our sink is too low.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.241
And, Tina,
stop telling my business.

00:24.285 --> 00:26.852
And you, keep my back
out your mouth.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.551
[phone chimes]

00:29.594 --> 00:31.248
[groans]

00:31.292 --> 00:33.294
Oh, damn.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.035
Text from my brother, Curtis.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.558
Said he's coming to visit.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.908
Oh, nice. He hasn't been here
for a couple of years.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.257
It'll be good to see him.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.954
I don't know,
whenever he shows up,

00:41.998 --> 00:43.869
he always wants something.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.262
We know it ain't money.

00:45.306 --> 00:48.004
Well, it better not be a kidney.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.354
Baby, with that $100 million
lottery jackpot he got,

00:50.398 --> 00:52.269
he can buy
all the kidneys he wants.

00:52.313 --> 00:55.272
Wait, wait, I thought
he was with Mama Marilyn

00:55.316 --> 00:57.231
on a luxury cruise
around the world?

00:57.274 --> 00:59.015
Uh, whatever, man.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.191
If I had won
the Super Powerball,

01:01.235 --> 01:04.325
I'd have bought Mama
her own cruise ship.

01:04.368 --> 01:05.978
Well, if Uncle
Curtis is coming,

01:06.022 --> 01:08.111
I need to update
my Amazon Wish List.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.200
Oh, me, too--
put me down for two jet skis.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.941
One for me
and one to rent.

01:11.984 --> 01:13.421
See, that's called
passive income.

01:14.857 --> 01:18.034
Guys, he's your uncle,
not Black Santa.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.211
But if he wants to buy us
one of those

01:21.255 --> 01:23.344
Sleep Number beds,
I would not be mad at him.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.215
Well, I am mad at him.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.087
Always flaunting
that money around

01:27.130 --> 01:30.090
like an NBA rookie
on All-Star weekend.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.440
Sounds like
somebody's jealous.[laughs]

01:34.529 --> 01:36.444
I didn't say
it was you.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.489
Well, good, because I'm not.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.187
I got everything I need.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.885
I got a beautiful wife,
adequate kids.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.454
[doorbell rings]Oh, I'll get it.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.369
You know what,
I'm just gonna text Curtis

01:48.412 --> 01:49.500
and tell him we out of town.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.154
I just don't want
to hear the noise.

01:51.198 --> 01:54.157
I don't want to hear
all that yackety-yack...

01:54.201 --> 01:56.855
Uh... what's all this?

01:56.899 --> 01:59.206
Here's... Curtis!

01:59.249 --> 02:01.556
[cheering, clamoring]

02:05.386 --> 02:07.953
Yeah! Yeah!

02:07.997 --> 02:11.000
Boy, you always knew
how to make an entrance.

02:11.043 --> 02:13.437
I mean, at least this time
you didn't blow money

02:13.481 --> 02:15.961
by bringing a gospel choir
and pole dancers.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.398
[laughs]
No, dawg.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.487
Of course not.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.054
Ix-nay on the pole ancers-day.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.013
Ix-nay.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.191
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:28.235 --> 02:29.192
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.068
[laughing]

02:36.112 --> 02:39.115
So the hostess says
there's a 30-minute wait,

02:39.159 --> 02:42.162
and Mama's getting hangry,
so I bought the place.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.686
Now I own a Applebee's.

02:44.729 --> 02:47.123
I mean, what other choice
did I have?

02:48.385 --> 02:50.648
I don't know,
you could've waited at the bar

02:50.692 --> 02:53.303
and ordered Riblets
like regular people?

02:53.347 --> 02:57.177
I can't believe you left
Mama Marilyn on a cruise ship.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.396
Oh, she's fine. I left her
at the blackjack table

02:59.440 --> 03:03.052
with a gang of chips, a Pepsi,
and a bucket of shrimps.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.535
Okay, well, maybe I should
call her and let her know

03:07.578 --> 03:10.059
you're no longer
in the bathroom.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.062
Well, you know,
it's so good to finally meet

03:13.105 --> 03:14.542
Calvin's little brother.

03:14.585 --> 03:17.414
Ah, yeah, I got to tell you,
when we saw six Escalades

03:17.458 --> 03:21.201
pull up on the street, I
thought it was the president.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.507
Not yet,
but I'm putting together a team.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.163
Oh, hasn't this country
been through enough?

03:28.469 --> 03:30.166
I don't know.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.994
Those are some pretty
sweet rides out front.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.256
Yeah, man, I would love to take

03:33.300 --> 03:35.127
one of those out for a spin.

03:35.171 --> 03:38.043
Finally, my Oprah moment!
You get

03:38.087 --> 03:39.349
a car and you get a car!

03:39.393 --> 03:40.698
Oh, my--Yeah!

03:40.742 --> 03:43.440
Hey, don't get too attached--
they're rentals.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.357
Anybody else need a car?

03:47.401 --> 03:49.707
Or a Applebee's?

03:49.751 --> 03:51.535
Well, you know, to be honest,

03:51.579 --> 03:53.102
we could use
one of those SUVs tomorrow.

03:53.145 --> 03:54.712
We're taking a ton of
stuff to the Goodwill.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.627
Oh, yeah, we moved here
with so much stuff,

03:56.671 --> 03:58.281
and we never really organized.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.065
So we want to get it done
while Grover's away at camp.

04:00.109 --> 04:01.284
Yeah, and if we don't
do it now, we're gonna

04:01.328 --> 04:02.546
have to rent a storage unit.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.418
Oh, well, we wouldn't have to

04:04.461 --> 04:06.333
if someone didn't insist
on keeping

04:06.376 --> 04:09.118
every T-shirt from every 5K
he's ever run.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.208
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, Gemma.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.601
They all spark joy.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.385
Dave, they can't
all spark joy.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.082
Well--That's ridiculous.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.562
[door closes]

04:18.606 --> 04:20.608
White people have
the strangest fights.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.003
These are real smooth,
man.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.483
Should be.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.746
I knew a guy that knew a guy
that knew Castro.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.400
But if anybody asks,

04:30.444 --> 04:32.141
they're Honduran.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.622
[chuckles]

04:34.665 --> 04:37.581
Yeah, man,
we've come a long way, huh?

04:37.625 --> 04:39.191
Remember Mama and Daddy

04:39.235 --> 04:41.585
had to put everything
on layaway?

04:41.629 --> 04:43.413
I remember my first Big Wheel.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.589
By the time I got it,
I was too big for it.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.592
Yeah, we had to grease
you up pretty good

04:48.636 --> 04:51.116
to get you in and out
of that thing, remember?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.510
[laughs]
Man.

04:53.554 --> 04:56.078
I'm so glad those days
are behind us.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.298
Now I got a guy for everything.

04:58.341 --> 05:01.126
If I want something, I get it.

05:01.170 --> 05:04.086
Well, it's not that easy for me.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.306
I've been saving up money
to get Tina

05:06.349 --> 05:08.960
this Birkin bag
for our 35th anniversary.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.441
It's not for another
three years, but by that time,

05:11.485 --> 05:13.095
I should have the money,
you know?

05:13.138 --> 05:14.444
I hear those bags ain't cheap.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.316
Oh, no.

05:16.359 --> 05:19.275
A bag that expensive should
come with its own shoulder.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.624
[laughs]

05:20.668 --> 05:23.584
Nah. Tina's worth it.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.455
You got a really good one
there, Cee.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.196
Yeah, thank you, man.

05:27.239 --> 05:28.806
I mean, you got you
a good woman, too.

05:28.850 --> 05:32.157
You-you and Raquel, y'all coming
up on, like, a year now, huh?

05:32.201 --> 05:33.507
How's she?

05:33.550 --> 05:35.726
She left me.

05:35.770 --> 05:38.250
Classic story.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.470
I bought her
some parasailing classes.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.777
She flies off
with the instructor.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.390
That's the real reason
why I came.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.610
I needed
my big brother's support.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.438
Man, I'm sorry
to hear that, little bro.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.701
I thought she was happy.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.485
I bought her everything.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.357
I even got her mother a new hip,

05:57.400 --> 05:58.967
so she could Tootsie Roll again.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.012
[laughs]

06:01.056 --> 06:02.971
Well, you know what?
That's Raquel's loss.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.451
And her Tootsie Rollin' mama.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.366
[both laugh]

06:06.409 --> 06:08.019
I got you,
little brother.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.500
Yeah.Thank you, C-Boogie.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.503
[coughing]

06:13.547 --> 06:14.983
You okay?

06:15.026 --> 06:16.550
Cigar too strong?

06:16.593 --> 06:19.422
No, it just reminds me
of Raquel.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.381
Packed, stacked,

06:21.424 --> 06:23.383
and bad for me.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.388
Aw, the slow cooker we got

06:28.431 --> 06:30.346
for our wedding
that we never used.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.304
Obvious toss, right?

06:32.348 --> 06:34.219
Well, I don't know.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.960
What if I need to make a stew?

06:36.004 --> 06:37.614
Have you ever made a stew?

06:37.658 --> 06:40.443
Well, no,
but I haven't needed to.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.618
Oh.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.664
[knocking]Oh.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.494
Oh, hey, Curtis.Hi.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.409
Hello, Calvin's friends.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.716
You said you needed
to be organized,

06:52.760 --> 06:54.414
so I hired Tyler.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.285
He's a stuff organizer.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.942
I prefer "domestic
efficiency expert."

07:00.985 --> 07:03.074
Yeah, I can't remember all
that-- I'm just gonna call you

07:03.118 --> 07:06.121
a "stuff organizer."

07:06.164 --> 07:07.949
You're Tyler.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.429
From Tyler Tidies Up.

07:09.472 --> 07:12.214
I watch your show...
when I should be cleaning.

07:12.257 --> 07:14.477
Wow, thank you, Curtis.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.957
Hey, what can I say?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.959
I make dreams come true.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.961
Later, kitty cats.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.441
Oh, meow!

07:23.094 --> 07:24.705
Hey, uh...

07:24.748 --> 07:27.272
didn't you help organize
Harry and Meghan's new house?

07:27.316 --> 07:29.057
Yes, and, uh, not to dish,

07:29.100 --> 07:30.624
but they are total hoarders.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.062
I mean, how many photographs
of the queen do you need?

07:34.105 --> 07:36.107
Oh, no.

07:36.151 --> 07:39.241
These can't possibly be
raver jeans.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.373
I'm telling you right now,
I'm tossing your glowsticks.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.420
[scoffs]
See what I'm dealing with here?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.117
Okay, all right,
I am not quite sure

07:46.161 --> 07:48.250
how these made it
into the junk pile.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.774
I wore these to my very first
Sugar Ray concert.

07:52.341 --> 07:53.951
Look, I know parting

07:53.995 --> 07:55.953
with belongings
can be stressful.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.260
But I've got
just one question for you.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.480
Do you like clutter?

08:02.525 --> 08:04.614
No?
No.

08:04.658 --> 08:07.443
Of course not,
so I'll go through every inch

08:07.487 --> 08:10.185
of your home and decide
where everything belongs.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.448
Oh, my gosh, this is just
like being on your show.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.145
Okay, how can we help?

08:14.189 --> 08:16.408
You can't.
Leave, and let Tyler--

08:16.452 --> 08:17.627
[British accent]:Tidy up!

08:17.671 --> 08:19.499
[clears her throat]

08:19.542 --> 08:22.023
Sorry, that's your line.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.155
No, no, I get it,
you're excited.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.417
But don't do it again.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.206
Ooh, okay, okay.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.555
Curtis hooked you boys up.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.252
Oh, big time, Mama.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.167
Drake was rocking
these babies in his last video.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.995
Oh, mm-hmm.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.562
Okay, do I look
debonair?

08:39.606 --> 08:41.172
No... don't answer that.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.652
I feel debonair.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.524
And that is
all that matters.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.570
[both laughing]

08:47.614 --> 08:49.703
Yes.
Yo!

08:49.746 --> 08:53.184
I bet you thought you'd never
helicopter to Tijuana for tacos.

08:53.228 --> 08:55.578
It was worth pissing off
that border patrol.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.146
Oh, that serrano ceviche

08:58.189 --> 09:00.365
was muy caliente.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.064
Hey, nephews.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.370
I got you a little
something.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.589
Aw, Uncle Curtis.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.025
You got to stop
buying us stuff, man.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.374
So y'all don't want
these Rolexes?

09:09.418 --> 09:11.289
No, I mean after this.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.118
No, no, after this, after this.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.598
Baby, I thought
you said you hated it

09:15.642 --> 09:17.513
when Curtis throws
his money around.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.428
Well, I do, babe, but...

09:19.471 --> 09:22.387
he's going through
a real bad breakup, so...Oh.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.520
...if buying things for
people makes him happy,

09:24.564 --> 09:27.001
who am I to judge?

09:27.044 --> 09:28.437
[doorbell rings]

09:28.480 --> 09:30.047
Oh, I'll get it.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.136
Oh, by the way...

09:32.180 --> 09:34.051
I got you something.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.576
Oh.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:46.368 --> 09:48.588
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.633
No, no, no!

09:50.677 --> 09:53.288
Oh, somebody pinch me!

09:53.331 --> 09:55.507
A Hermes Birkin bag?!

09:55.551 --> 09:58.075
I-I've been wanting
one of these for years!

09:58.119 --> 10:00.251
Seven years
to be exact.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.297
What? How did you know?

10:02.340 --> 10:04.647
Baby, you told him,
didn't you?

10:04.691 --> 10:06.649
I sure did.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.260
Oh, thank you so much!Look!

10:09.304 --> 10:11.306
Look! Look, look at my...
[grunts]

10:11.349 --> 10:13.569
Look at my bag!

10:13.613 --> 10:15.266
No need to say anything.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.442
That look on your face is
thanks enough.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.414
Look at her.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.764
She's so smooth and sexy.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.113
Just like me.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.770
I'm gonna call her Burkina.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.469
You know, I-I'm gonna need
a special place in my closet.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.950
Boys, come help me
clean out my closet.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.083
And part of your dad's, too.

10:49.126 --> 10:51.651
[vocalizing]

10:54.741 --> 10:56.743
Curtis.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.440
Let me stop you right there.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.050
You're welcome.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.532
I'm "welcome"?

11:03.575 --> 11:06.404
You just made me look like
a chump in front of my wife.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.363
What did I do?
I just bought Tina

11:08.406 --> 11:10.626
a bag she wanted.
I did you a favor.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.497
I didn't need a favor,
all right?

11:12.541 --> 11:14.456
I was gonna buy that bag myself.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.676
Yeah, but not
for another three years.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.808
I saved you all that
time and money.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.941
Did you see the happy look
she gave me?

11:20.984 --> 11:22.943
Yes.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.640
I saw the look.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.989
That was the look
I was supposed to get.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.469
You stole my look!

11:27.512 --> 11:30.167
I'm rich-- I don't got to steal.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.737
Curtis, me buying her that purse

11:34.781 --> 11:36.652
was important to me, all right?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.741
It was a symbol
of my love for her.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.003
That's beautiful.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.744
So we did it!

11:41.788 --> 11:44.399
See, you just don't get it.

11:44.442 --> 11:47.010
You think you can just always
slide in here and buy folks.

11:47.054 --> 11:50.013
Well, you can't buy
my family and friends.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.059
Where is it?
Where's Burkina?

11:52.102 --> 11:54.670
Right here!
She's right here, oh, my God!Oh, my God!

11:54.714 --> 11:56.933
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen!Isn't it gorgeous?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.630
Ladies? Ladies!

11:58.674 --> 12:00.676
Please, I'm trying
to make a point here.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.333
Oh, you made your point.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.901
Loud and clear.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.478
You know, with a little bit
of distance, I can see

12:20.522 --> 12:22.524
that it's time
to let go of some stuff.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.004
Yes, it is.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.006
And, honey, I am really
proud of you.

12:26.049 --> 12:28.008
We are gonna feel
so much better

12:28.051 --> 12:30.401
after purging all your junk
we don't need.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.492
[gasps]
Oh...

12:34.536 --> 12:36.843
Welcome to Xanadu.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.801
Everything has been put away.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.847
And you've been Tyler-ed.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.501
Is it just me,

12:43.545 --> 12:45.416
or does
this room seem larger?

12:45.460 --> 12:47.418
Yeah, it's nice, uh...

12:47.462 --> 12:49.638
[chuckles]
What's with the bags?

12:49.681 --> 12:51.683
I've organized your essentials.

12:51.727 --> 12:54.034
And what's in these bags
is non-essential.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.819
Dave, I know
this is gonna be hard,

12:56.863 --> 12:58.778
but you're just gonna have
to let go of some things

12:58.821 --> 13:00.736
we don't need, like this.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.826
[gasps] What in the fluff
and fold have you done?!

13:07.003 --> 13:08.831
This isn't trash.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.312
These are
all my pageant dresses.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.053
Yes,
your ancient pageantry items

13:13.096 --> 13:15.316
were taking up space
in your closet.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.884
If by "taking up space,"

13:17.927 --> 13:21.409
you mean "lovingly stored
away from light."

13:23.628 --> 13:25.674
Now, Gemma, I know
this is gonna...

13:25.717 --> 13:28.329
Stay out of this, Dave!Look...

13:28.372 --> 13:30.722
I know it's difficult,
but as I say on my show,

13:30.766 --> 13:33.421
"If it's covered in dust,
saying toodle-oo is a must."

13:33.464 --> 13:35.945
[gasps]
The only thing non-essential

13:35.989 --> 13:38.556
around here is you,
Harry Poppins.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.558
Get out of my house.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.038
[Brooklyn accent]:
Ah, you know what, lady?

13:42.082 --> 13:43.823
I knew doing
a side gig was a mistake.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.826
I don't need this.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.655
Hold on, uh...
what happened to your accent?

13:50.699 --> 13:52.353
It's an act, Columbo.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.877
Nobody wants to take cleaning
advice from a guy from Brooklyn.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.060
You okay?

14:04.104 --> 14:06.802
I know some people

14:06.846 --> 14:08.804
think beauty pageants
are superficial,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.807
but that prize money
helped me pay for college.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.027
Plus, my mom spent hours

14:14.070 --> 14:16.638
sewing these dresses.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.683
They're also really pretty.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.687
I had no idea
these meant so much to you.

14:22.731 --> 14:25.342
I know it was my idea
to get rid of all this clutter,

14:25.386 --> 14:27.997
but there are just some things
I can't let go of.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.478
Look, it's like
my JNCO jeans.

14:30.521 --> 14:33.089
You know, when I first saw
them in Miller's Outpost,

14:33.133 --> 14:35.831
I was, I was...
oh, my gosh.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.138
I had to have them.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.838
But, you know, that's a
story for another time.Yeah, mm-hmm.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.753
This is about your dresses.Yeah.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.584
Oh, hey, Calvin.

14:49.627 --> 14:52.761
Want some snow shoes
or a laser disc player?

14:53.805 --> 14:55.982
No and hell no.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.984
It's the 21st century, Dave.

14:59.463 --> 15:00.900
What are you doing out here?

15:00.943 --> 15:02.902
Eh, just trying
to chill out.

15:02.945 --> 15:06.557
Curtis bought Tina
that purse I've been saving for.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.864
I've never seen her
so happy.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.866
That made me so mad.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.348
Well, I'm sorry.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.567
I guess that lottery
money changed him.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.353
No, he's always been
like that.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.659
When we were younger, I'd be
hanging out with my friends,

15:21.703 --> 15:24.445
Curtis would pop up,
and give them all candy.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.056
He was everybody's favorite
until the candy ran out.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.407
Then they all come running back
to me with their blue tongues.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.718
Well, it sounds
like the same kid

15:36.761 --> 15:38.850
just with a bigger
bank account.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.940
Well, he's not a kid.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.333
He's a grown man.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.856
Yeah, but, you know,

15:44.900 --> 15:47.642
wanting to be liked
never goes away.

15:47.685 --> 15:48.904
Hmm.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.732
Yeah, I guess so.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.517
Well, damn, Dave,
you just helped me

15:53.561 --> 15:56.564
understand my little brother
better than I ever have before.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.914
Thanks, man.Well, you're welcome.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.438
Hey, are you sure you don't
want this laser disc player?

16:01.482 --> 16:03.527
You know,
Top Gunis stuck inside.

16:03.571 --> 16:06.313
Sorry, Goose, but I've lost
that loving feeling.

16:09.925 --> 16:12.319
Dave, I told you I didn't
want to waste money

16:12.362 --> 16:15.104
putting our junk in an
overpriced storage unit.

16:17.628 --> 16:18.847
[gasps]

16:18.890 --> 16:21.589
Oh...

16:21.632 --> 16:23.025
So what do you think

16:23.069 --> 16:25.767
about the Gemma Johnson Museum?

16:25.810 --> 16:28.030
[gasps]
I love it!

16:28.074 --> 16:30.511
I do want to waste
money putting our junk

16:30.554 --> 16:33.775
in an overpriced
storage unit!

16:33.818 --> 16:36.473
Well, you know, we do have owe
Tyler some credit for rescuing

16:36.517 --> 16:38.693
these dresses
from the back of your closet.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.043
They should be in a place
where you can enjoy them.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.654
Oh.Plus the first month's rent
was only a dollar.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.571
Thank you so much.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.095
You are the sweetest.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.401
[gasps] And you got
all my favorites.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.837
Miss Hog Queen.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.535
Miss Freshwater Trout.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.106
Wait a minute,
are those your raver jeans?

17:00.149 --> 17:02.717
Oh, yeah,
that's a special exhibit.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.024
On loan from
the Dave Johnson collection.

17:08.070 --> 17:10.420
Yes! There we go, there we go.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.769
Booyah!

17:11.813 --> 17:14.337
You're a joke.
Pay up, sucker.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.994
Who's next?Me.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.041
How'd you find me?

17:22.084 --> 17:24.086
Wasn't that hard.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.654
I mean, you would always come
here whenever you got upset.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.699
Come on, man,
let's go.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.485
First off the block.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.704
Yeah,
right into a wall.Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

17:33.748 --> 17:35.619
Yes, yes, yes.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.012
I'm on that corner, baby...Yes...

17:37.056 --> 17:38.970
Whoa! Whoa!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

17:39.014 --> 17:40.972
No! Yes, yes!

17:41.016 --> 17:42.496
Yeah!

17:42.539 --> 17:45.325
Watch out, truck!Dang it!

17:45.368 --> 17:46.848
How'd we both come in third?

17:51.026 --> 17:52.941
Hey, look, Curtis.

17:52.984 --> 17:55.335
I know you thought
you were doing me a solid

17:55.378 --> 17:57.076
when you bought Tina
that purse.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.254
All right? It-it's your way
of expressing love and...

18:01.297 --> 18:03.691
it's okay for a rich man
like yourself, but for me,

18:03.734 --> 18:05.910
it takes a lot of sacrifice.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.870
I spent a lot of late nights
in that shop

18:08.913 --> 18:12.003
fixing cars-- hell,
I even gave up my NFL package.

18:12.047 --> 18:15.920
That's how much I wanted
to buy that purse for Tina.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.881
Wow, I never thought
of it like that.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.579
And you were right.

18:22.623 --> 18:25.887
I do use my money to
get people to like me.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.281
Look, money doesn't
make people like you.

18:28.324 --> 18:30.761
Yeah, well, I got 100 mil
that says you wrong.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.330
See, that's your problem.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.897
Just because you received it,

18:35.940 --> 18:38.291
doesn't mean
that you achieved it.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.380
Respect isn't bought.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.946
It's earned.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.559
You sound like my
team of therapists.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.387
[chuckles softly]

18:47.430 --> 18:49.563
You know,
the right kind of people?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.956
They'll always
love you for you.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.916
Which reminds me,

18:54.959 --> 18:57.353
whenever you're ready
to start dating again,

18:57.397 --> 18:59.747
would you please take
"I hit the Super Powerball"

18:59.790 --> 19:01.401
off your Tinder profile?

19:01.444 --> 19:04.360
[laughs]
All right.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.319
I guess I'm gonna have to put
something corny on there like,

19:06.362 --> 19:09.104
"I like rom coms and
long walks to the bank."

19:10.453 --> 19:13.587
Okay, you know what,
we gonna keep working on that.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.893
See, Cal?

19:15.937 --> 19:17.982
This is why
I came home, man.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.943
You always know how
to pick me up, kid.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.424
And it's free of charge.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.295
All right, man, come on,
let's get this thing started.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.688
So I can beat your ass
on this motorcycle.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.256
You the one that's gonna
get beat down.
All right.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.431
Cal?

19:31.474 --> 19:32.606
Sorry about the purse.

19:32.649 --> 19:33.911
I'll take it back.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.392
[scoffs]
Good luck with that.

19:36.436 --> 19:39.526
Tina sleeps with that thing
handcuffed to her wrist.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.530
And I also bought you something
to make up for everything.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.532
Hey, Curtis.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.795
I told you, man,
I love you for you.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.971
I don't need anything.

19:50.014 --> 19:52.800
Cool, I'll just take
back the Ferrari.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.542
"Ferrari"?

19:55.585 --> 19:58.022
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.808
Look, man,
I can't accept that,

20:00.851 --> 20:03.506
but we can take it
back to the dealership

20:03.550 --> 20:05.029
the long way.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.424
Come on, man, let's go,
let's get this...

20:08.468 --> 20:11.035
Some pretty riding,
pretty riding...

20:18.695 --> 20:20.480
All right, now, buckle up,
'cause we're about

20:20.523 --> 20:22.133
to make some
bad decisions.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.353
[chuckling]
And this time,

20:24.397 --> 20:26.921
Mama won't be around
to give us a whupping.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.184
[laughing][engine revs]

20:29.228 --> 20:31.404
[gears cranking]Wait.

20:31.447 --> 20:34.189
You spent $300,000
on this car

20:34.233 --> 20:35.973
and you don't know
how to drive it?

20:36.017 --> 20:37.497
That's because
my big brother never

20:37.540 --> 20:39.281
taught me how to drive stick.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.543
Oh, okay.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.458
So that's on me, all right.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.287
Well, I'm gonna teach you now.
First...

20:45.331 --> 20:47.028
you got to ease up off
the clutch and give it some gas

20:47.071 --> 20:49.422
at the same time.
Let me check you out.

20:49.465 --> 20:50.945
Okay, like this?

20:50.988 --> 20:52.512
[both scream]

20:52.555 --> 20:54.427
CURTIS:
I'm doing it, I'm doing it!

20:54.470 --> 20:57.256
CALVIN:
Yeah, but you're
on the sidewalk doing it!

20:57.299 --> 20:58.518
CURTIS:
Aah!
