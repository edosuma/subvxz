WEBVTT

00:02.727 --> 00:03.848
Come on old friend

00:03.858 --> 00:05.878
so what, you think
our Jimmy took a playdate?

00:05.888 --> 00:08.508
If there's a history log
in here, we could look up...

00:08.518 --> 00:09.638
There.

00:09.648 --> 00:12.448
Pete, Artie says
that H.G. Wells is actually--

00:12.458 --> 00:13.578
a woman...

00:13.679 --> 00:15.299
Could you please be careful
with that

00:15.309 --> 00:16.429
I know all about it.

00:16.439 --> 00:17.359
You what?

00:17.369 --> 00:18.669
I was Apprenticed at Warehouse 12.

00:24.444 --> 00:25.610
Oh!

00:25.678 --> 00:27.212
Cavorite was
an anti-gravity metal

00:27.280 --> 00:30.615
that Wells about,
but cavorite doesn't exist.

00:34.454 --> 00:35.320
James?

00:35.388 --> 00:36.655
James!

00:36.723 --> 00:40.592
I'm sorry, Arthur.

00:40.660 --> 00:43.061
You stop trying
to confuse me!

00:44.430 --> 00:46.531
Pete, you've been infected
by an artifact.

00:46.599 --> 00:48.500
Myka, you and Artie,
you got to get out of here.

00:48.568 --> 00:50.335
He's got snipers
all over the place!

00:50.403 --> 00:52.070
The telegraph seems
to have tapped

00:52.138 --> 00:54.139
into some subliminal anxiety.

00:54.207 --> 00:56.708
Take some time off,
Agent Lattimer.

00:56.776 --> 01:00.579
Hmm.

01:00.646 --> 01:02.647
I guess I'm just
lucky that

01:02.715 --> 01:04.483
the only vet in Univille
makes house-calls.

01:04.550 --> 01:06.018
I love ferrets.

01:06.085 --> 01:07.552
Besides, this is
a farming community

01:07.620 --> 01:09.121
and if I didn't
make house-calls,

01:09.188 --> 01:12.290
my office would look
like a traveling circus.

01:12.358 --> 01:14.826
Myka!

01:14.894 --> 01:17.129
Guess how many croissants
I shoved into my mouth at once.

01:17.196 --> 01:18.497
One day you'll have
to tell me

01:18.564 --> 01:20.065
how you got partnered up
with that one.

01:20.133 --> 01:22.634
Well, the croissant thing's
actually kind of impressive

01:22.702 --> 01:24.036
when you see it.

01:24.103 --> 01:25.003
Yeah, at least it keeps him
from talking.

01:25.071 --> 01:26.505
Oh, that's right.

01:26.572 --> 01:28.373
You prefer your males
to bark and hump your leg.

01:28.441 --> 01:29.708
I'm sure it's
in your repertoire.

01:29.776 --> 01:31.543
Okay, okay.

01:31.611 --> 01:33.045
Thank you.

01:33.112 --> 01:34.546
You know, we have
to get back to work,

01:34.614 --> 01:35.981
but thank you so much
for coming.

01:36.049 --> 01:37.382
Myka, for you, anytime.

01:37.450 --> 01:41.553
Okay.

01:41.621 --> 01:43.455
What is with you two?
She started it.

01:43.523 --> 01:45.157
Good, good, you're here.
Follow me.

01:45.224 --> 01:46.792
We got a ping.

01:46.859 --> 01:47.959
Awesome.
Time to get back out there

01:48.027 --> 01:49.895
and kick some artifact butt.

01:49.962 --> 01:51.430
Mmm, not you, no.

01:51.497 --> 01:53.231
Until we're sure that
there's no residual effect

01:53.299 --> 01:55.033
from your last encounter,
you are grounded.

01:55.101 --> 01:57.035
Myka, you're going
to Tamalpais University

01:57.103 --> 01:58.637
in Northern California.

01:58.704 --> 02:00.038
Artie, this is about
a wrestling team.

02:02.675 --> 02:03.942
God, all right, all right.
Yes, yes.

02:04.010 --> 02:05.444
It's about a wrestling team.

02:05.511 --> 02:07.646
This wrestling team,
they've lost every match

02:07.713 --> 02:09.580
for the last seven years
and overnight,

02:09.649 --> 02:11.049
they've become unstoppable.

02:11.117 --> 02:13.051
No, this is--
this is one of ours.

02:13.119 --> 02:15.754
I know you wrestled in college.

02:15.822 --> 02:17.956
What can I say?
Irony is my specialty.

02:18.024 --> 02:19.624
So--
grounded!

02:19.692 --> 02:22.194
This team was tested
for steroids, right?

02:22.261 --> 02:24.162
One of the kids
on the team died

02:24.230 --> 02:26.631
three weeks ago,

02:26.699 --> 02:29.267
in a fire,
alone, camping.

02:29.335 --> 02:30.702
If an artifact
is helping them,

02:30.770 --> 02:32.204
it could also be killing them.

02:32.271 --> 02:33.271
Okay, I'm on it.

02:33.339 --> 02:34.806
Yeah, Claudia, take this,

02:34.874 --> 02:37.342
because you're going with Myka
to California as a backup.

02:37.410 --> 02:39.444
For reals?

02:39.512 --> 02:42.280
My first official assignment
as an Agent?

02:42.348 --> 02:44.683
Shut up!
As...An Apprentice.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.351
While you're on campus,

02:46.419 --> 02:48.286
enroll and get a degree,
will you?

02:48.354 --> 02:52.057
Will you never stop
with that?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.304 --> 03:09.207
Should I have worn something
more business-suity,

03:09.275 --> 03:10.876
you know, so people take
me seriously as an Agent?

03:10.943 --> 03:12.544
You're not an Agent.
You're an Apprentice.

03:12.612 --> 03:14.012
Right.
Apprentice.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.080
Taking notes.

03:15.148 --> 03:17.382
"Jeans are fine."

03:20.720 --> 03:23.355
Well, it looks
like they won again.

03:23.422 --> 03:25.190
Think the artifact's in here?

03:25.258 --> 03:28.326
Anything's possible,
but artifacts don't talk.

03:28.394 --> 03:30.195
People talk.

03:30.263 --> 03:31.463
Right.

03:31.531 --> 03:33.932
Interviews with people, indeed.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.502
I'm ready to begin
my Apprentice education.

03:37.570 --> 03:39.504
Hoo-wah!

03:39.572 --> 03:41.940
Always happy to answer
questions on how much

03:42.008 --> 03:44.242
we're winning, but I'm not
sure what exactly

03:44.310 --> 03:47.579
you're investigating.

03:47.647 --> 03:50.081
Apprentice really
be in here?

03:50.149 --> 03:52.884
We just have some routine
questions for you.

03:52.952 --> 03:54.986
Gary!

03:55.054 --> 03:57.189
Gary, come talk
to these ladies.

03:57.256 --> 03:59.691
Sure, Coach.
What's up?

03:59.759 --> 04:01.459
Hi, Gary, is it?

04:01.527 --> 04:03.762
So why do you think your team
started winning?

04:03.829 --> 04:05.063
I mean, what changed?

04:05.131 --> 04:06.831
Coach Tappon finally
got our asses in gear.

04:06.899 --> 04:08.533
He got us to want it again.

04:08.601 --> 04:10.969
And if you want it bad enough,
you're gonna crush it.

04:11.037 --> 04:12.871
And now we're crushing it.

04:12.939 --> 04:15.440
But seven straight seasons
without a win

04:15.508 --> 04:17.642
and now all of a sudden--

04:17.709 --> 04:18.543
Oh!

04:20.313 --> 04:21.947
Claudia, do you want
to see what's going on

04:22.014 --> 04:22.948
out in the hallway?

04:23.015 --> 04:25.217
Okay, thanks, bye.

04:33.492 --> 04:35.594
Hey.

04:35.661 --> 04:37.162
Hey, aren't you the guy
who just won?

04:37.230 --> 04:39.297
I feel weird.

04:39.365 --> 04:41.733
My muscles are hurting bad.

04:41.801 --> 04:43.201
I think I need a--

04:46.939 --> 04:48.773
Ah!

04:52.912 --> 04:55.614
Myka!
Myka!

04:58.751 --> 05:04.522
<font color=#7fff00>â™ª Warehouse 13 2x07 â™ª</font>
<font color=#ffff00>For the Team</font>

-- for <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.Com</font> --

05:30.483 --> 05:33.553
One death on the team
is bad enough.

05:33.607 --> 05:37.376
Two is...Unthinkable.

05:37.444 --> 05:39.812
But I know Phillip
would want us to go on.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.214
How'd it go with the police?

05:42.282 --> 05:44.984
He just caught on fire, Myka.

05:45.051 --> 05:48.287
I should have done something.

05:48.355 --> 05:50.189
There wasn't anything to do.

05:50.257 --> 05:51.724
You would have
done something.

05:51.791 --> 05:52.825
You would
stay calm at least.

05:52.893 --> 05:56.629
I literally freaked out.

05:56.696 --> 05:58.030
So the police are calling
it an accident?

05:58.098 --> 05:59.965
Of undetermined cause.

06:00.033 --> 06:02.434
But I hacked the coroner's
report on both desks.

06:02.502 --> 06:03.636
Check it out.

06:03.703 --> 06:04.737
Teddy Benson,
the wrestler who died

06:04.804 --> 06:06.205
in the campsite fire?

06:06.273 --> 06:07.339
Burn patterns show
that the fire

06:07.407 --> 06:09.208
started inside
his sleeping bag.

06:09.276 --> 06:13.379
Okay, so two deaths by
spontaneous combustion

06:13.446 --> 06:15.047
on the same wrestling team.

06:15.115 --> 06:16.815
Yeah, I call shenanigans.

06:16.883 --> 06:20.786
And unless a sweaty gym sock
is the artifact,

06:20.854 --> 06:25.491
then there's nothing that--

06:25.558 --> 06:26.892
okay, there's that.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.594
Hoo-wah!

06:28.662 --> 06:31.330
Oh, yeah.
You can score that a 9.8.

06:31.398 --> 06:33.432
All right, I'm gonna
go talk to the Coach

06:33.500 --> 06:36.035
about that medal and you
follow up with the team.

06:36.102 --> 06:37.336
Wait. Follow up?

06:37.404 --> 06:38.370
By myself?
Yeah.

06:38.438 --> 06:39.505
Talk to them.

06:39.572 --> 06:40.706
You know, investigate.

06:40.774 --> 06:43.876
Sure.
Yeah, I'll just follow up.

06:51.318 --> 06:53.352
Ahh, mom!

06:53.420 --> 06:54.920
Pete!

06:54.988 --> 06:56.488
Are those Timothy Leary's
glasses?

06:56.556 --> 06:58.157
Take them off right now.
That's not a toy.

06:58.224 --> 06:59.491
I'm bored, okay?

06:59.559 --> 07:01.360
They make things
so much less boring.

07:01.428 --> 07:03.162
Did you hear what I said?
Take 'em off right now.

07:03.229 --> 07:04.596
Right now.

07:04.664 --> 07:06.065
Wouldn't you rather
have a nice little fish?

07:06.132 --> 07:07.599
Okay, stop it.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.535
Give me the glasses.
Don't!

07:09.602 --> 07:11.503
Get up out of my chair.

07:11.571 --> 07:12.871
Child.

07:12.939 --> 07:15.841
Man, desk duty is lame.

07:15.909 --> 07:17.376
Ow.

07:17.444 --> 07:19.078
Oh, it's nothing personal,
<i>senor sensitivo.</i>

07:19.145 --> 07:22.047
No.
Ow.

07:22.115 --> 07:23.749
What?
What? What is it?

07:23.817 --> 07:25.985
It's nothing.
It's no big deal.

07:26.052 --> 07:28.887
It's just probably
my appendix growing back.

07:28.955 --> 07:31.423
Your who with the what now?

07:31.491 --> 07:34.193
Yeah, it's, uh...

07:34.260 --> 07:36.161
Grows back every year.

07:36.229 --> 07:38.530
It's a side effect of spending
too much time

07:38.598 --> 07:39.865
in the Warehouse.

07:39.933 --> 07:41.300
Hmm?

07:41.368 --> 07:42.368
Nothing to worry about.

07:42.435 --> 07:44.136
It's all good.

07:44.204 --> 07:46.105
Yeah, I need a visit
from the doctor.

07:46.172 --> 07:51.877
Yeah.

07:51.945 --> 07:53.512
What?

07:53.580 --> 07:55.581
Are you serious?

07:55.648 --> 07:57.983
Touching a gold medal caused
them to burn up?

07:58.051 --> 07:59.585
You got both paddles
in the water?

07:59.652 --> 08:00.786
You were a champion.

08:00.854 --> 08:02.221
Now you're a Coach.

08:02.288 --> 08:03.422
I know what it's like
to do good work

08:03.490 --> 08:04.790
and no one notices.

08:04.858 --> 08:07.326
A winning team puts you
back on top.

08:07.394 --> 08:09.294
Whoa.

08:09.362 --> 08:10.996
You think I'm involved
in their deaths?

08:11.064 --> 08:12.498
You're out of your mind.

08:12.565 --> 08:14.033
If I'm crazy,
show me the medal.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.734
I'm not showing you anything.

08:15.802 --> 08:18.170
Coach Tappon, we'd love
for you to join us

08:18.238 --> 08:19.805
whenever you're free.

08:19.873 --> 08:21.106
Great, Jeff.
I'm sorry.

08:21.174 --> 08:22.107
Just give me a sec.

08:22.175 --> 08:25.010
Be right with you.

08:29.315 --> 08:31.083
Great.

08:31.151 --> 08:33.552
Now I'm pissing off
the team's benefactors

08:33.620 --> 08:34.453
so you can accuse me
of attacking my guys.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.854
I am just trying to protect--

08:35.922 --> 08:37.589
if you scare my guys,
I'll have you

08:37.657 --> 08:43.261
thrown off this campus.

08:47.367 --> 08:50.602
So, Gary, is it?

08:50.670 --> 08:52.871
Yeah.
Um...

08:52.939 --> 08:55.307
Can I help you?

08:55.375 --> 08:58.143
So Coach Tappon.

08:58.211 --> 09:02.114
Does he ever seem maybe
too intent on winning?

09:02.182 --> 09:04.383
"Too intent on winning"?

09:04.451 --> 09:06.785
I don't even know
what that means.

09:06.853 --> 09:10.656
I mean does he put you under
a lot of, you know, pressure?

09:10.723 --> 09:12.724
Pressure?

09:12.792 --> 09:14.460
Have you ever tried getting out
of a half nelson

09:14.527 --> 09:16.528
with a 200-pound monster's
on top of you?

09:16.596 --> 09:18.030
Okay, now when you say,
"monster,"

09:18.098 --> 09:19.565
I'm gonna assume you mean
a really big guy

09:19.632 --> 09:21.900
and not an actual monster,
because in my line of work--

09:21.968 --> 09:23.969
what I mean
is pressure is good.

09:24.037 --> 09:25.237
It makes you win.

09:25.305 --> 09:26.772
Okay, yes, but does
the Coach care

09:26.840 --> 09:28.774
about your safety
or just winning?

09:28.842 --> 09:31.376
Would he risk a wrestler's life
to, I don't know,

09:31.444 --> 09:32.811
place in a match--

09:32.879 --> 09:34.012
hey, this is my Coach
we're talking about.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.147
I'm not gonna let you
rip on him.

09:35.215 --> 09:36.348
Oh, no, no, no.

09:36.416 --> 09:38.383
No, I wouldn't deign to rip.

09:38.451 --> 09:39.985
I'm just...

09:40.053 --> 09:43.422
Observing,
analyzing the facts,

09:43.490 --> 09:46.425
supposing a possible--
interrogating the--

09:46.493 --> 09:48.760
not that you--
you okay?

09:48.828 --> 09:51.263
You seem kind of new at this.

09:51.331 --> 09:54.299
Are you, like, that other lady's
assistant or something?

09:54.367 --> 09:55.901
Or something.

09:55.969 --> 09:59.505
If I need anything,
I'll circle back.

09:59.572 --> 10:03.375
Thanks so much
for coming, doctor.

10:03.443 --> 10:04.576
And how's that?

10:04.644 --> 10:05.944
Does that hurt?
It's fine.

10:06.012 --> 10:07.412
No, no.
How about there?

10:07.480 --> 10:08.747
No.

10:08.815 --> 10:11.383
So our own Warehouse doctor,
huh?

10:11.451 --> 10:13.185
Yes, Pete,
it's in the manual,

10:13.253 --> 10:16.388
chapter 112, section F,
paragraph 3.

10:16.456 --> 10:17.823
Yeah, yeah.

10:17.891 --> 10:20.459
I haven't quite gotten
to chapter 112 yet.

10:20.527 --> 10:21.727
Yeah, why don't you
go downstairs

10:21.794 --> 10:23.028
and read it right now?

10:23.096 --> 10:24.730
Well, I was hoping you'd read
it to me, papa.

10:24.797 --> 10:26.932
Vanessa, I'm really
sorry about him.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.267
And I'm sorry you have
to come all the way

10:28.334 --> 10:29.701
to South Dakota just for this.

10:29.769 --> 10:31.303
Oh, well, your appendix
is always

10:31.371 --> 10:32.638
the highlight
of my year, Artie.

10:32.705 --> 10:33.839
Wow.

10:33.907 --> 10:38.443
What's the rest
of your year like?

10:38.511 --> 10:39.945
Have you been working
on your meridians?

10:40.013 --> 10:41.613
My--

10:41.681 --> 10:44.383
the acupuncture points
I asked you to tap on like this.

10:44.450 --> 10:46.218
Yeah, just--I remember.
Ah!

10:46.286 --> 10:47.819
I'm really ticklish there.

10:47.887 --> 10:49.021
You can't do that.
I know.

10:49.088 --> 10:50.222
Sit up.
Okay.

10:50.290 --> 10:51.657
Yes, I have, actually.

10:51.724 --> 10:53.225
I've worked on--
oh, you're lying.

10:53.293 --> 10:54.426
Yes, I am.

10:54.494 --> 10:55.694
If you're gonna blow hot air,

10:55.762 --> 10:59.431
will you mind blowing into this
for me, please?

11:05.338 --> 11:06.471
Well, you're not infected.

11:06.539 --> 11:07.539
Oh, that's good, right?

11:07.607 --> 11:10.475
Yeah, it's good.

11:10.543 --> 11:12.377
Given your proclivity
to appendicitis,

11:12.445 --> 11:14.613
I really still think we should
remove it again.

11:14.681 --> 11:16.415
Okay.
Just prophylactically.

11:17.784 --> 11:19.251
"Prophylactically"?

11:19.319 --> 11:21.420
Shut up.

11:21.487 --> 11:22.921
I place myself in your hands.

11:22.989 --> 11:24.890
Okay, let me go
put on some scrubs.

11:24.958 --> 11:26.358
Prepare the procedure room
and I'll let you know

11:26.426 --> 11:27.593
when I'm ready for you, okay?

11:27.660 --> 11:31.063
Okay, awesome.

11:42.842 --> 11:45.344
Maybe I'm wrong,
but...

11:45.411 --> 11:47.613
Are Vanessa and Artie
sitting in a tree?

11:47.680 --> 11:49.314
Ah, don't be absurd.

11:49.382 --> 11:50.949
We're two adults
who just have a lot

11:51.017 --> 11:52.751
of professional respect
for each other.

11:52.819 --> 11:54.553
And shut up.
K-I-s-s-I-n-g.

11:54.621 --> 11:55.821
I knew it.

11:55.888 --> 11:56.955
Artie is human.

11:57.023 --> 11:58.290
Walk away.

11:58.358 --> 11:59.491
You like her.
Stop it.

11:59.559 --> 12:01.026
You want to hug her
and kiss her...

12:01.094 --> 12:02.094
Right.
I'm walking away.

12:02.161 --> 12:03.328
And squeeze her
and all right!

12:03.396 --> 12:05.264
Don't touch me there.

12:08.101 --> 12:09.768
Good, you've
got the purple goo.

12:09.836 --> 12:11.303
Coach Tappon's office
is empty.

12:11.371 --> 12:13.572
Artie said there's no record
of Tappon's medal on file,

12:13.640 --> 12:14.873
but we should still
goo it just in case.

12:14.941 --> 12:16.408
It was hard to hear.

12:16.476 --> 12:18.543
Pete kept singing something
about Artie in a baby carriage.

12:18.611 --> 12:20.746
Good.
Well, let's go get this medal.

12:20.813 --> 12:22.814
Do you think he's
doing this on purpose?

12:22.882 --> 12:25.183
No, but I think
he's hiding something.

12:25.251 --> 12:27.619
How can you tell, like,
just from one interview?

12:27.687 --> 12:28.987
I mean, is that instinct?

12:29.055 --> 12:30.589
Well, instinct
is just a fancy way of saying

12:30.657 --> 12:32.691
I've done this 10,000 times.

12:32.759 --> 12:34.393
You don't think maybe
this guy's different?

12:34.460 --> 12:35.927
Well, human beings
are predictable

12:35.995 --> 12:38.263
and people rarely
surprise you.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.877
Turn around and put
your hands in the air.

12:51.944 --> 12:56.448
Slowly.

12:56.516 --> 13:00.018
H.G. Wells.

13:00.086 --> 13:01.586
Agent Bering.

13:01.654 --> 13:04.323
Seems we're forever destined
to meet at gunpoint.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.403
Ladies, I know this
is a bit awkward,

13:09.470 --> 13:11.004
but maybe we could just--

13:13.274 --> 13:14.975
Or we could just do this.

13:15.043 --> 13:19.012
You are going back
to the Bronze Sector.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.314
Why?
What did I do?

13:20.381 --> 13:23.417
You're a killer and a thief.

13:23.484 --> 13:25.886
Brain requires...
Oxygen...

13:25.954 --> 13:27.154
To speak.

13:27.222 --> 13:30.224
Myka.

13:30.291 --> 13:34.761
Oh!

13:37.098 --> 13:38.865
I'm not a killer.

13:38.933 --> 13:40.033
Oh, has the definition
of "killer"

13:40.101 --> 13:42.202
changed a bunch since
the 1890s?

13:42.270 --> 13:43.937
'Cause, H.G.,
you killed a guy.

13:44.005 --> 13:46.740
James MacPherson?

13:46.808 --> 13:50.077
He would have quite happily
killed all of you.

13:50.144 --> 13:51.478
Why are you here?

13:51.546 --> 13:53.714
Did you just happen
to show up?

13:53.781 --> 13:57.884
I'm hunting for the same
artifact as you.

13:57.952 --> 13:59.953
That's what we're looking for.

14:00.021 --> 14:02.556
That's rather my point.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.825
Take it.

14:08.529 --> 14:11.665
And if you didn't believe me
just a little,

14:11.733 --> 14:13.400
you'd have shot me by now.

14:14.769 --> 14:16.403
The Coach.

14:16.471 --> 14:18.572
He can't find us here.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.941
He can't find you in here.

14:21.009 --> 14:22.476
He hasn't met me yet.

14:22.543 --> 14:23.910
What? Do not.
Don't.

14:23.978 --> 14:26.013
No.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.514
Is your name Coach Tappon?

14:27.582 --> 14:29.516
Yeah.
Oh, thank God I've found you.

14:29.584 --> 14:31.551
She's good.

14:31.619 --> 14:34.988
Yeah, sure,
in an obvious kind of way.

14:35.056 --> 14:36.556
Worked on Pete in London.

14:36.624 --> 14:39.259
Well, that's not exactly
scaling Mt. Everest, is it?

14:39.327 --> 14:41.061
Come on, let's call Artie.

14:47.935 --> 14:49.436
An appendectomy?
Are you--

14:49.504 --> 14:51.138
yeah, forget--
I'm fine.

14:51.205 --> 14:53.373
Just tell me exactly
what's going on.

14:53.441 --> 14:54.875
Room's all set.
Are you?

14:54.942 --> 14:56.543
Uh, as ever.

14:56.611 --> 14:57.411
Just one second,
'cause I'm in the--

14:57.478 --> 14:58.612
okay.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.013
Yeah, look--

15:00.081 --> 15:01.315
you know what?
I got it.

15:01.382 --> 15:03.750
Just--just take care
of yourself.

15:03.818 --> 15:06.119
Okay, thanks.

15:07.689 --> 15:08.855
My turn.
Oh.

15:08.923 --> 15:11.024
Don't start without me.

15:17.699 --> 15:21.168
What?

15:21.235 --> 15:24.171
Nothing.

15:24.238 --> 15:25.906
I was just wondering...

15:25.973 --> 15:29.009
What <i>this...</i>

15:29.077 --> 15:30.477
Was doing on your shelf.

15:30.545 --> 15:32.145
Yeah, I'm wondering
what you're doing

15:32.213 --> 15:33.380
messing around
with my thing.

15:33.448 --> 15:34.815
That's the Barnum to

15:34.882 --> 15:36.350
Ba-bam!

15:36.417 --> 15:37.984
Oh, that's right, sir.

15:38.052 --> 15:40.087
I've been doing
a little read-a-roonie

15:40.154 --> 15:41.855
of the artifact manifest.

15:41.923 --> 15:43.123
Fascinating stuff.

15:43.191 --> 15:46.226
Turns out P.T. Barnum
used this to,

15:46.294 --> 15:50.097
and I quote,
"increase the shock factor

15:50.164 --> 15:52.699
"in his sideshows by using it
to grow human limbs

15:52.767 --> 15:55.769
and in some cases,
internal organs."

15:55.837 --> 15:59.239
You, sir, have been growing
back your appendix

15:59.307 --> 16:02.476
in an attempt to get Vanessa
to visit the Warehouse!

16:05.213 --> 16:06.346
That's so romantic.

16:06.414 --> 16:07.748
Are you quite finished?

16:07.815 --> 16:10.083
If only...
So, "no," then.

16:10.151 --> 16:14.054
There were some way
for you to...

16:14.122 --> 16:17.724
Interact with Vanessa
that did not involve

16:17.792 --> 16:21.194
invasive surgery.

16:21.262 --> 16:23.764
Perhaps some kind of--

16:23.831 --> 16:25.632
I don't know.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.701
Social ritual.

16:27.769 --> 16:31.872
One involving the sharing
of food or the enjoying

16:31.939 --> 16:35.509
of filmed entertainment
with maybe some duds

16:35.576 --> 16:38.378
that have been milked.

16:38.446 --> 16:41.581
Ahh.

16:41.649 --> 16:42.816
I mean a date.

16:42.884 --> 16:44.684
I know what you mean.

16:44.752 --> 16:46.286
Artie, you like her.

16:46.354 --> 16:48.622
She--hey, hey, hey--likes you.

16:48.689 --> 16:49.856
Ask the woman out.

16:49.924 --> 16:50.957
Okay.

16:51.025 --> 16:54.294
Artie?

16:54.362 --> 16:55.429
I'm sorry.

16:55.496 --> 16:56.696
I'm gonna have
to postpone the surgery.

16:56.764 --> 16:58.465
A Regent has tungsten poisoning,
of all things,

16:58.533 --> 17:00.534
and I have to leave
for Budapest immediately.

17:00.601 --> 17:02.969
Ooh, that sounds
serious there.

17:03.037 --> 17:04.905
You should go.
All right.

17:04.972 --> 17:06.239
Yeah.

17:06.307 --> 17:11.344
I got to make my flight
arrangements.

17:11.412 --> 17:12.746
Get out of my sight.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.248
Don't come near me.
I'll kill you.

17:21.722 --> 17:23.123
Really?
Nothing?

17:23.191 --> 17:24.590
Nope.

17:24.659 --> 17:26.526
The medal is not
the artifact,

17:26.594 --> 17:29.362
which also means that H.G.
had nothing to lose

17:29.430 --> 17:30.997
by handing it over.

17:31.065 --> 17:31.898
Unless she
didn't know either.

17:31.966 --> 17:33.567
Oh, she knew.

17:33.634 --> 17:36.403
I don't know what her game is,
but I don't trust her.

17:36.471 --> 17:37.704
Well, I swiped Tappon's
records

17:37.772 --> 17:39.573
from the personnel office.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.007
Last month, he moved
to bayside heights.

17:41.075 --> 17:42.742
Very schmancy and Richie Rich.

17:42.810 --> 17:45.011
Where does a college wrestling
Coach get the money

17:45.079 --> 17:46.079
to buy a house like that?

17:46.147 --> 17:48.148
Maybe H.G.'S paying him off.

17:48.216 --> 17:49.416
Where would she get the money?

17:49.484 --> 17:50.584
Well, you accrue
a lot of interest

17:50.651 --> 17:51.952
in 100 years.

17:52.019 --> 17:53.386
I'm gonna go snoop around
for a connection.

17:53.454 --> 17:55.889
You finish interviewing
the wrestling team.

17:55.957 --> 17:58.625
Um, no, maybe I should stick
to the computer stuff.

17:58.693 --> 18:00.794
I'm really not good
at the interviews,

18:00.862 --> 18:02.796
especially with,
you know, people.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.731
Mm-hmm.

18:04.799 --> 18:09.102
Okay, so...
Why do you say that?

18:09.170 --> 18:11.438
Well, I tried to be
like you, you know?

18:11.506 --> 18:14.274
All professional and adult
and that--

18:14.342 --> 18:16.643
is really...

18:16.711 --> 18:18.578
Really dumb.

18:18.646 --> 18:20.313
Is that your version
of a pep talk?

18:20.381 --> 18:22.716
No.

18:22.783 --> 18:24.384
We already have one me.

18:24.452 --> 18:26.319
We don't need
another me, okay?

18:26.387 --> 18:28.188
I want you to go in there
and be more like you.

18:28.256 --> 18:29.789
What would that get us?

18:29.857 --> 18:31.691
Claudia, you're the same age
as these guys.

18:31.759 --> 18:32.893
You're a peer.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.327
You can connect with them.

18:34.395 --> 18:37.597
Yeah, not so much.

18:37.665 --> 18:39.566
Okay.
Okay then.

18:39.634 --> 18:41.835
Go back to the Warehouse then.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.471
You know, not everyone's
cut out for field work.

18:44.539 --> 18:47.040
You know, stay behind
a computer forever.

18:47.108 --> 18:48.942
Forever's
kind of a long time.

18:49.010 --> 18:50.677
I don't have time to hold
your hand through this, Claude.

18:50.745 --> 18:52.245
If you are not up for this--

18:52.313 --> 18:53.547
well, I didn't say that.

18:53.614 --> 18:54.848
Okay, well,
let me know how it goes.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.316
Okay, I will.

18:56.384 --> 18:58.151
Good then.
Good.

18:58.219 --> 18:59.419
Oh, I know
what you did there.

18:59.487 --> 19:00.687
I know.

19:00.755 --> 19:03.256
It's 'cause you're smart.

19:03.324 --> 19:07.227
Go.

19:08.696 --> 19:10.263
Gar-bear, afternoon.

19:10.331 --> 19:11.731
Let's talk.
Hey.

19:11.799 --> 19:13.199
Irritating question girl.

19:13.267 --> 19:15.135
We kind of already talked.

19:15.202 --> 19:16.570
No, you already avoided
telling me anything.

19:16.637 --> 19:17.671
Now we talk.

19:17.738 --> 19:19.906
By the way, Photoshop.

19:19.974 --> 19:22.342
Anyway, check this.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.511
Phillip and Teddy's deaths were
not accidental.

19:24.579 --> 19:26.580
My Intel says Coach is dirty.

19:26.647 --> 19:28.148
Maybe even got some payola.

19:28.215 --> 19:32.552
Thoughts?

19:32.620 --> 19:33.887
Stratego.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.355
What do you know?

19:35.423 --> 19:37.390
Nothing.

19:37.458 --> 19:38.458
It's just a feeling.

19:38.526 --> 19:39.926
Spill it, hulkling.

19:39.994 --> 19:42.696
Don't make me angry.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.903
Coach Tappon saved us, okay?

19:49.971 --> 19:51.271
I mean, in a town like this,

19:51.339 --> 19:52.939
you either work at the
bottling plant or you get out.

19:53.007 --> 19:55.208
And now even the plant's
about to close down.

19:55.276 --> 19:57.978
Because of Coach,
now I have options

19:58.045 --> 20:00.213
and maybe a scholarship.

20:00.281 --> 20:01.648
I have people who did that
for me too.

20:01.716 --> 20:02.849
Gave me options.

20:02.917 --> 20:03.850
Then you know
I can't turn on him.

20:03.918 --> 20:08.154
Yeah, but, dude...

20:08.222 --> 20:09.990
If something bad's happening
to your friends,

20:10.057 --> 20:14.394
even by accident,
don't you owe them too?

20:17.264 --> 20:20.600
He started acting weird
after Teddy died.

20:20.668 --> 20:22.268
Closed-door meetings,

20:22.336 --> 20:24.838
phone calls in the middle
of practice.

20:24.905 --> 20:25.872
He was acting--

20:25.940 --> 20:27.374
guilty?

20:27.441 --> 20:29.476
No.

20:29.543 --> 20:32.846
Scared.

20:32.913 --> 20:34.447
No, it's too dangerous.

20:34.515 --> 20:36.583
Listen to me.
They think I'm responsible.

20:36.651 --> 20:38.418
And what if I am?

20:38.486 --> 20:39.986
No, I'm sorry,

20:40.054 --> 20:42.789
but I'm ending this now.

20:58.827 --> 20:59.961
Okay, here's <i>here we go.</i>
What you're gonna do.

21:00.399 --> 21:01.533
Set something up for when
she gets back.

21:02.073 --> 21:02.906
Dinner, a movie--
shh! Shh!

21:02.973 --> 21:04.641
I can't do that.

21:04.708 --> 21:06.076
Take her for a walk.

21:06.143 --> 21:08.445
Show her the dark vault.
Doesn't matter, okay?

21:08.512 --> 21:10.346
Just make a plan.

21:10.414 --> 21:12.315
I don't know--
okay.

21:12.383 --> 21:14.184
Then be one of those agents
that's obsessed

21:14.251 --> 21:15.251
with the Warehouse.

21:15.319 --> 21:18.088
That always works out so well.

21:18.155 --> 21:21.291
All right.

21:21.358 --> 21:23.793
Well, now you know
you're not infected,

21:23.861 --> 21:25.462
so you should be all right
till I get back, Artie.

21:25.529 --> 21:26.830
You okay with this?

21:26.897 --> 21:32.869
Um...

21:32.937 --> 21:35.939
Have a nice flight.

21:38.106 --> 21:39.907
Thanks.

21:43.981 --> 21:45.281
Geez, Artie,

21:45.349 --> 21:47.250
it's not like she hasn't
already seen you naked.

21:47.318 --> 21:50.253
Thank you very much for that.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.518
This was no accident.

21:59.586 --> 22:00.819
It means someone else
out there knows

22:00.887 --> 22:04.590
about the artifact.

22:04.657 --> 22:09.661
Look who's here.

22:09.729 --> 22:13.265
Keep an eye
on things, Claude.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.334
Hey!

22:15.401 --> 22:19.738
Our lead suspect is killed
and look who shows up.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.573
Oh, do stop it.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.308
What motive could
I have possibly had

22:23.376 --> 22:26.345
for killing those boys
and a wrestling Coach?

22:26.412 --> 22:28.046
That's an excellent question.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.281
Perhaps we should
ask the Regents.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.483
They did have you
bronzed once.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.585
You know as well as I,
women are held

22:33.653 --> 22:35.721
to a different standard.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.223
Something, by the way, I thought
would have changed by now.

22:38.291 --> 22:40.559
Don't you dare play
that card with me.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.995
Why not?

22:43.062 --> 22:45.364
Your partner died
and people whispered.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.366
If you'd been a man--
nice.

22:47.433 --> 22:48.500
That's very clever.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.669
You did your research.

22:50.737 --> 22:54.773
What did you steal
from the Escher Vault?

22:56.943 --> 23:00.779
That's what I thought.

23:00.847 --> 23:05.217
I took back what was mine.

23:05.285 --> 23:07.286
Oh, and what is that?

23:07.353 --> 23:10.422
That more cavorite?

23:10.490 --> 23:14.793
What are you gonna do,
yank me up into the sky?

23:14.861 --> 23:17.062
The only power
it has is over me.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.070
It's my daughter.

23:25.138 --> 23:26.104
Was.

23:26.172 --> 23:29.408
My Christina.

23:29.475 --> 23:32.978
Everything that ever mattered
in my life is gone now,

23:33.046 --> 23:36.882
except the Warehouse.

23:36.950 --> 23:40.485
Look, I know what it's like
to lose someone, but--

23:40.553 --> 23:42.321
I want to come back
and work there again.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.423
You what?

23:44.490 --> 23:47.559
That's why I'm doing
all of this.

23:47.627 --> 23:51.096
To prove I am still
a good Agent.

23:51.164 --> 23:55.133
Look, I'm sorry about
your little girl.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.802
I really am.

23:56.869 --> 23:59.237
But it's not possible--

23:59.305 --> 24:00.772
please?
You can't--

24:00.840 --> 24:03.642
please?

24:03.710 --> 24:07.446
Every day in this world is
a reminder of what I've lost.

24:07.513 --> 24:09.281
My child, my friends, my life.

24:09.349 --> 24:10.916
I have no tether here.

24:10.984 --> 24:15.787
The Warehouse is the only home
I have now.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.736
Ooh! Whoa!

24:30.803 --> 24:33.438
I do miss the horse
and buggy days.

24:33.506 --> 24:36.775
Progress is
in many ways overrated.

24:39.746 --> 24:42.781
Whoo!

24:42.849 --> 24:44.983
Ahh.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.018
Whoo!

24:46.085 --> 24:48.487
A grappling hook?

24:48.554 --> 24:52.157
I designed it myself.

24:52.225 --> 24:53.525
What?

24:53.593 --> 24:55.127
Nothing.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.863
It's just a little
old fashioned.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.432
Well, it wasn't when
I invented it.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.135
And it seems
to have saved your life.

25:03.202 --> 25:06.204
And yet you're still wondering
if I set this whole thing up

25:06.272 --> 25:07.806
just to prove my innocence.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.542
Well, the thought did
cross my mind

25:10.610 --> 25:13.412
somewhere between,
"holy crap, I'm gonna die,"

25:13.479 --> 25:15.714
and, "oh, I'm flying!"

25:15.782 --> 25:18.850
And what have you concluded?

25:18.918 --> 25:20.519
The jury's still out.

25:20.586 --> 25:24.589
I suppose if
we work together,

25:24.657 --> 25:26.191
it may be faster.

25:26.259 --> 25:28.226
And you could keep
an eye on me.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.861
Yes.

25:29.929 --> 25:33.765
That thought
crossed my mind too.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.667
You coming?

25:38.371 --> 25:40.472
Hey, look what I found.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.040
Tag says it reduces
shyness, so I--

25:42.108 --> 25:43.108
ah! Ow, ow!

25:43.176 --> 25:44.609
Artie!

25:44.677 --> 25:46.211
Pain.
Lots.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.279
Not good.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.880
Never hurt like this before.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.582
Well, that's 'cause
the doc always took it out.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.684
Yeah, must still be growing.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.753
Might keep growing
till it bursts.

25:54.821 --> 26:00.125
Ow.

26:00.193 --> 26:01.927
You know, this is called
breaking and entering

26:01.994 --> 26:03.095
these days.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.764
It always was.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.200
Things haven't changed much.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.936
Oh.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.304
Uh, why don't you take
the desk?

26:12.371 --> 26:13.672
I'll go through the closet.

26:13.739 --> 26:19.411
Aye, aye.

26:19.479 --> 26:22.347
So you built that gun, huh?

26:22.415 --> 26:25.584
You are coveting
my grappler.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.185
Old fashioned, indeed.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.054
Admiring maybe.

26:29.122 --> 26:31.089
Not coveting.

26:31.157 --> 26:34.192
My technical skill could
come in very handy

26:34.260 --> 26:39.131
when I come back to work.

26:39.198 --> 26:42.834
Why were you bronzed?

26:42.902 --> 26:45.170
The scales
that lady justice holds

26:45.238 --> 26:47.839
are more easily tipped
than one knows.

26:47.907 --> 26:50.375
The world is never
as you think it should be.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.878
Well, it's not
my decision anyway.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.613
You know, I don't even think
it's Artie's.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.214
Of course.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.449
No pressure.

26:57.517 --> 26:58.984
Just making conversation.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.820
Pointed conversation,
but nevertheless--

27:01.888 --> 27:03.255
here.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.357
Let me do it.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.259
Oh.

27:14.467 --> 27:17.702
H.G., come here.
Look at these pictures.

27:17.770 --> 27:20.839
These are all of Phillip,
only he's--

27:20.907 --> 27:23.642
quite a bit more
of a roly-poly.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.977
Look at the dates
on these files.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.847
He did this in three weeks.

27:28.915 --> 27:33.318
Something's turning these boys
into perfect specimens.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.554
And then killing them.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.255
Just a little farther, Artie.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.423
To this chair.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.958
Oh, little help here.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.294
At some point, you people
will have to realize

27:42.361 --> 27:44.863
that "Veterinarian" means
"animal doctor," not humans.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.665
Hey, I don't want
to be here either, so--

27:46.732 --> 27:48.166
look, Doc Wellins
is out of town.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.634
His appendix is about
to burst,

27:49.702 --> 27:51.236
so it's either the vet
or the barber.

27:51.304 --> 27:52.504
An appendectomy?

27:52.572 --> 27:54.172
You do realize that most
of the surgeries

27:54.240 --> 27:56.441
I perform are spaying
and neutering?

27:56.509 --> 27:58.076
Okay, the barber.
The barber.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.477
Oh!
Look, Artie.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.845
Please sit down.
Okay.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.181
I mean, come on.
Help the guy out.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.150
Hey, I can make him look
like a giant walrus,

28:05.218 --> 28:06.685
if that makes it any easier.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.453
Artie, I will help you,
if only to take you

28:08.521 --> 28:09.588
out of his care.

28:09.655 --> 28:10.689
Good idea.
Come on.

28:10.756 --> 28:12.023
Let's go to the exam room.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.425
Ow!

28:13.492 --> 28:15.660
Hey, croissant-boy,
I need a prep nurse.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.062
Get in here.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.064
Okay, but I'm not
shaving anything.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.733
More wrestlers
are getting sick.

28:21.801 --> 28:25.737
Pretty soon the whole team's
gonna end up extra crispy.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.339
That's strange.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.074
Why would they
put a padlock

28:29.141 --> 28:31.209
on a fridge?

28:38.184 --> 28:40.852
"Boiling Point Energy Drink"?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.521
Myka, every time I saw Gary,
he was chugging

28:43.589 --> 28:49.160
one of these drinks.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.862
It's the drink.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.231
Claudia, you have to get
to Gary and warn him.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.399
On it.

28:54.467 --> 28:58.336
The artifact is in the drink.

29:09.402 --> 29:12.471
So Dr. Mahoney, you created
the Boiling Point formula?

29:12.539 --> 29:14.139
Yes, and there's nothing
harmful in it.

29:14.207 --> 29:17.509
It's vitamins, caffeine,
amino acids.

29:17.577 --> 29:19.078
It's like any other drink
on the market

29:19.145 --> 29:21.213
except that ours is specially
formulated

29:21.281 --> 29:22.715
to accelerate muscle growth.

29:22.782 --> 29:24.116
It helps people.

29:24.184 --> 29:25.384
You're testing it
on the wrestling team

29:25.452 --> 29:26.852
at Tamalpais.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.587
There are laws against that.

29:28.655 --> 29:30.255
Nonsense!
It was a focus group.

29:30.323 --> 29:32.024
The kids were getting faster,
stronger--

29:32.092 --> 29:33.392
and combustible.

29:33.460 --> 29:35.160
Boiling Point
financially supports

29:35.228 --> 29:37.596
the team and you
paid Coach Tappon

29:37.664 --> 29:38.731
to get them to drink it.

29:38.798 --> 29:41.266
That wasn't my idea!

29:41.334 --> 29:42.401
It was mine.

29:42.469 --> 29:46.405
Jeff Russell.
Welcome, ladies.

29:46.473 --> 29:48.007
Gerald, they're looking
for you in the lab.

29:48.074 --> 29:49.742
Great.

29:49.809 --> 29:51.143
On campus,
you pulled Coach Tappon

29:51.211 --> 29:52.978
into a meeting.

29:53.046 --> 29:55.314
Boiling Point is your company.

29:55.382 --> 29:57.416
Founder and CEO, miss?

29:57.484 --> 30:00.019
<i>Agent</i> Bering,
Secret Service.

30:00.086 --> 30:01.286
And you are?

30:01.354 --> 30:04.023
Agent Wells.

30:04.090 --> 30:05.958
Who is also an Agent
under me.

30:06.026 --> 30:08.394
Does whatever I say.

30:08.461 --> 30:11.597
Lots of companies
support school teams

30:11.665 --> 30:13.465
and we owe a lot to this town.

30:13.533 --> 30:14.933
And for me,
it was personal.

30:15.001 --> 30:16.168
You were on
the wrestling team?

30:16.236 --> 30:19.505
Coach Tappon helped to
focus my life.

30:19.572 --> 30:21.040
I wanted
to give something back.

30:21.107 --> 30:22.241
So what?

30:22.308 --> 30:23.842
So people died.

30:23.910 --> 30:26.011
Coach Tappon died.

30:26.079 --> 30:28.380
And I'm sad about that.

30:28.448 --> 30:31.417
But I'm still waiting
to hear your proof

30:31.484 --> 30:33.419
that my drink was responsible.

30:33.486 --> 30:36.188
Or you could come with me
and I can prove to you

30:36.256 --> 30:40.359
that it's completely harmless.

30:40.427 --> 30:42.461
Might be a trap.

30:42.529 --> 30:44.396
Usually is.

30:44.464 --> 30:47.299
Here's my impression of Pete
at the sight of blood.

30:49.536 --> 30:50.436
No, no, no, no, no.

30:50.503 --> 30:51.704
Yes.

30:51.771 --> 30:53.172
I never sounded like--

30:53.239 --> 30:56.308
okay, that's fairly accurate.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.743
Just 'cause I was worried
about him.

30:57.811 --> 30:59.712
Oh, right, right.
It's sweet.

30:59.779 --> 31:01.513
A little girly, but sweet.

31:01.581 --> 31:02.981
Girly.

31:03.049 --> 31:05.084
Artie, we thought you would
recuperate better here,

31:05.151 --> 31:07.019
but you got to promise that
you're gonna try

31:07.087 --> 31:08.187
to get some rest.

31:08.254 --> 31:10.422
Great.
Artie loves resting.

31:10.490 --> 31:12.257
Oh, and he will,

31:12.325 --> 31:13.459
because I'm putting you
in charge.

31:13.526 --> 31:14.493
If he's not up
on his feet

31:14.561 --> 31:16.128
in a couple of days,

31:16.196 --> 31:17.196
I'm coming after you.

31:17.263 --> 31:18.297
You're in charge?

31:18.364 --> 31:19.998
That's right, old boy.

31:20.066 --> 31:21.266
I'll go get you some soup.

31:21.334 --> 31:24.203
Okay.

31:29.209 --> 31:30.242
You should ask her out.

31:30.310 --> 31:32.044
Me ask her out?
Yeah.

31:32.112 --> 31:33.445
Right.

31:33.513 --> 31:35.347
Or be one of those
agents obsessed

31:35.415 --> 31:36.448
with the Warehouse.

31:36.516 --> 31:37.649
That always works out so well.

31:37.717 --> 31:38.817
You weren't talking to me.

31:38.885 --> 31:40.152
Oh, no?
No.

31:40.220 --> 31:41.453
Oh, well,
who was I talking to?

31:41.521 --> 31:43.322
I don't know.
Let's just see.

31:43.389 --> 31:45.224
When I died in the tunnel,
didn't you think

31:45.291 --> 31:48.827
for just an instant,
"poor Artie.

31:48.895 --> 31:53.031
He gave his life to this place
and he died alone"?

31:53.099 --> 31:54.500
Hmm?

31:54.567 --> 31:55.868
And since then, I see what's
been happening to you.

31:55.935 --> 31:57.436
What happening?
No happening.

31:57.504 --> 31:59.004
I think you're worried
that you caught

31:59.072 --> 32:01.507
a glimpse
into your own future.

32:01.574 --> 32:04.009
Oh, those painkillers are
making you loopy, old boy.

32:04.077 --> 32:05.811
Oh, no, I'm not
on any painkillers.

32:05.879 --> 32:07.880
And then your stuff
didn't come from home,

32:07.947 --> 32:09.915
so you feel uprooted
and last week,

32:09.983 --> 32:11.650
you imagined reconnecting
to an old girlfriend.

32:11.718 --> 32:14.086
In my defense,
I do have a lot of those dreams.

32:19.292 --> 32:21.126
Yeah.

32:21.194 --> 32:23.128
You don't have to miss out
on having a real life

32:23.196 --> 32:27.533
like I did.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.970
I'd be honored to have
a life like yours.

32:32.038 --> 32:35.474
I'd be honored if you'd
try for a little more.

32:41.681 --> 32:44.683
Dude, you look
like Bantha poodoo.

32:44.751 --> 32:48.020
Well, as you can see,
I feel fantastic.

32:48.087 --> 32:49.688
Spread the word
to your teammates.

32:49.756 --> 32:51.557
Stop drinking those dumb
energy drinks.

32:51.624 --> 32:52.991
And I need your help.

32:53.059 --> 32:54.159
Why?
What's wrong with--

32:54.227 --> 32:55.627
no, just trust me.

32:55.695 --> 32:56.929
The bottling plant,
you said it was closing down.

32:56.996 --> 32:58.664
Why?
I don't know.

32:58.731 --> 33:01.166
It's some kind of deal
to sell it off or something.

33:01.234 --> 33:02.801
Talk to me more about that.

33:07.140 --> 33:09.541
I found some tea.

33:09.609 --> 33:11.343
Why don't you people have soup?
I mean, everybody has soup.

33:11.411 --> 33:12.644
We're weird.

33:12.712 --> 33:14.079
Surgery was fun, huh?

33:14.147 --> 33:15.914
You got some moves
with that knife.

33:15.982 --> 33:17.416
Hey.
Want to get dinner?

33:17.483 --> 33:19.518
Or coffee.

33:19.586 --> 33:21.153
Pastries.

33:21.221 --> 33:22.487
The hardware store
has a candy aisle.

33:22.555 --> 33:23.555
We're not going out.

33:23.623 --> 33:25.157
We could stay inside.

33:25.225 --> 33:27.025
I heard the hardware store
delivers candy.

33:27.093 --> 33:30.996
Look, my ex, it turns out
he's a giant tool box

33:31.064 --> 33:33.265
and I moved to a place
where I couldn't

33:33.333 --> 33:34.933
possibly meet
any cute men, so--

33:35.001 --> 33:37.102
a-ha!
You think I'm cute.

33:37.170 --> 33:40.138
Pete, we're not going out.

33:40.206 --> 33:43.909
Yeah, but you think
I'm cute.

33:43.977 --> 33:46.245
As you can see,
there's nothing dangerous

33:46.312 --> 33:48.180
in the drink.

33:48.248 --> 33:49.781
Well, do you collect
test samples

33:49.849 --> 33:50.949
from every batch?

33:51.017 --> 33:52.951
For safety purposes.

33:53.019 --> 33:54.953
It's standard practice.
Why?

33:55.021 --> 33:56.355
That ladle.

33:56.422 --> 33:59.191
Is that what your people use
to collect the samples?

33:59.259 --> 34:00.959
I suppose.

34:01.027 --> 34:03.295
Myka, do you know
Godfrid's Spoon?

34:03.363 --> 34:04.463
No.

34:04.530 --> 34:07.266
We looked for it
at Warehouse 12.

34:07.333 --> 34:10.569
Godfrid Haraldsson,
a Viking Prince.

34:10.637 --> 34:12.271
It's supposedly forged
from the armor

34:12.338 --> 34:13.672
of fallen warriors.

34:13.739 --> 34:15.507
His men would drink
from it before battle.

34:15.574 --> 34:18.510
It gave them strength.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.612
What are you talking about?

34:20.679 --> 34:21.947
Mr. Russell,
where did you get this ladle?

34:22.014 --> 34:23.514
I don't know.
It's always been here.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.951
Myka, this plant's closing.

34:26.018 --> 34:27.185
Production moves
to Naperville, Illinois,

34:27.253 --> 34:28.553
in three weeks.

34:28.621 --> 34:29.888
What's in Naperville,
Illinois?

34:29.956 --> 34:31.023
Omnico Headquarters.

34:31.090 --> 34:32.291
They're buying Boiling Point.

34:32.358 --> 34:33.625
Beaucoup bucks
for the founder.

34:33.693 --> 34:36.495
That gives you motive
to keep the deaths quiet

34:36.562 --> 34:38.397
until the deal goes through
and it's not

34:38.464 --> 34:40.666
your problem anymore.

34:40.733 --> 34:42.266
This belongs to me.

34:42.335 --> 34:44.770
Gerald, what are you doing?

34:44.837 --> 34:45.971
You have no right
to come in here.

34:46.039 --> 34:47.406
That ladle touches
every batch

34:47.473 --> 34:48.674
of Boiling Point.

34:48.741 --> 34:50.007
Ruh-roh.

34:50.076 --> 34:51.677
You don't have to answer their
questions, Jeff.

34:51.744 --> 34:53.411
Mr. Russell,
does Dr. Mahoney have stake

34:53.478 --> 34:55.547
in your company's
sale to Oomnico?

34:55.614 --> 34:57.950
Gerald's been with Boiling
Point since the beginning.

34:58.017 --> 34:59.351
Jeff--

34:59.419 --> 35:01.086
he must have a fortune
in stock options by now.

35:01.154 --> 35:02.487
Jeff, shut up.

35:02.555 --> 35:05.791
Gerald, for God's sakes,
give them the ladle.

35:05.858 --> 35:08.026
No.
Hey! Hey!

35:08.094 --> 35:09.027
No!
No!

35:09.095 --> 35:10.262
What are you doing?

35:10.330 --> 35:13.565
No, Claudia!

35:13.633 --> 35:14.800
Grab Mahoney!

35:14.867 --> 35:16.401
Gerald, what have you done?

35:16.469 --> 35:18.036
He's about to tell
us right now.

35:18.104 --> 35:19.304
If Omnico finds
out the drink is flawed,

35:19.372 --> 35:22.407
the sale doesn't go through.

35:22.475 --> 35:23.809
What's gonna happen to her?

35:23.876 --> 35:25.978
The more you take in,
the quicker

35:26.045 --> 35:27.279
it seems to take effect.

35:27.347 --> 35:28.981
And it's seeping directly
into her pores.

35:29.048 --> 35:34.486
I'm afraid she's not
gonna last very long.

35:34.554 --> 35:35.921
I'm sorry.

35:35.989 --> 35:37.422
None of this should
have happened.

35:37.490 --> 35:38.991
The deal should have gone
through weeks ago,

35:39.058 --> 35:40.525
then everything
just got out of hand.

35:40.593 --> 35:41.960
You knew.

35:42.028 --> 35:44.262
You knew what we were putting
out there could--

35:44.330 --> 35:46.465
you killed Coach Tappon.

35:46.532 --> 35:49.501
Is it warm in here or am
I wearing 38 snuggies?

35:49.569 --> 35:51.103
Those boys only died because
they drank too much.

35:51.170 --> 35:52.671
It was never safe.

35:52.739 --> 35:53.739
You just thought
you could get away

35:53.806 --> 35:54.873
before anyone noticed.

35:54.941 --> 35:56.041
I didn't know how it worked.

35:56.109 --> 35:57.342
How long does she have?

35:57.410 --> 35:58.877
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

35:58.945 --> 36:00.412
Based on how quickly
she's reacting,

36:00.480 --> 36:02.014
I'd guess an hour,
maybe two.

36:02.081 --> 36:03.482
We have to act quickly.

36:03.549 --> 36:04.783
I'm not letting anyone else
get hurt by this.

36:04.851 --> 36:05.984
What do we do?

36:06.052 --> 36:07.519
Amino acids.

36:07.587 --> 36:09.721
The amino acids
may have made contact

36:09.789 --> 36:11.123
with the metal and amped up
the powers

36:11.190 --> 36:13.225
of the original ladle.

36:13.292 --> 36:15.160
I did a lot of research
on the subject

36:15.228 --> 36:16.828
of amino acids
for Dr. Moreau.

36:16.896 --> 36:18.630
Let me have a look.

36:18.698 --> 36:20.198
Perhaps I can cobble
together an antidote.

36:20.266 --> 36:21.833
But that was 115 years ago.

36:21.901 --> 36:24.936
I doubt amino acids have
changed a great deal since then.

36:25.004 --> 36:27.873
Hey!

36:27.940 --> 36:30.475
You're going to take Agent
Wells to your lab

36:30.543 --> 36:33.011
and you are going
to assist her now.

36:33.079 --> 36:35.013
I didn't want any of this.

36:35.081 --> 36:37.749
Then this is your lucky day,
Gerald.

36:37.817 --> 36:40.118
Because we're giving you
a chance to get it all sorted.

36:40.186 --> 36:42.421
Come on.

36:42.488 --> 36:43.555
Okay, I need something
that slows down

36:43.623 --> 36:44.890
the burning process.

36:44.957 --> 36:46.758
I'll put something together.
Okay.

36:53.699 --> 36:55.033
Any change?

36:55.101 --> 36:56.334
No, she's burning up.

36:56.402 --> 36:57.903
I'm fighting a losing battle.

36:57.970 --> 36:59.471
She doesn't have much time.

36:59.539 --> 37:01.773
I hope you have something.

37:01.841 --> 37:04.376
I hope so too.

37:04.444 --> 37:07.846
Claudia, I'm afraid this won't
taste very good.

37:13.853 --> 37:17.155
I know one mission won't change
your mind.

37:17.223 --> 37:20.759
I'm not expecting miracles
overnight.

37:20.827 --> 37:22.694
Just keep an open mind.

37:29.435 --> 37:32.637
Hey, you.

37:32.705 --> 37:34.206
How do you feel?

37:34.273 --> 37:35.440
Did I combust?

37:35.508 --> 37:37.175
No.

37:37.243 --> 37:40.145
If that guy made me combust,
I'm gonna be pissed.

37:40.213 --> 37:41.446
Oh, thank God.

37:41.514 --> 37:42.814
Here, let's just set you up.

37:42.882 --> 37:44.883
That's easy for u to say.

37:44.951 --> 37:47.018
Ooh.

37:47.086 --> 37:48.320
Okay?

37:48.387 --> 37:51.590
You should really thank H.G.

37:51.657 --> 37:54.493
She--

38:03.836 --> 38:05.103
U were being wheeled out--

38:05.171 --> 38:06.705
okay, I don't care
if I'm having

38:06.773 --> 38:08.440
a brain transplant!

38:08.508 --> 38:10.475
If you cross paths
with H.G. Wells,

38:10.543 --> 38:13.145
you yank me out
of anesthesia

38:13.212 --> 38:14.246
and you fill me in.

38:14.314 --> 38:15.347
Is that understood?

38:15.415 --> 38:16.782
I'm really glad she showed up.

38:16.849 --> 38:18.250
She saved my life.
Mine too.

38:18.318 --> 38:19.952
Yeah, well, MacPherson saved
my life countless times.

38:20.019 --> 38:21.753
It didn't change who he was.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.423
Is that understood?

38:24.490 --> 38:26.158
Yes, sir.

38:26.225 --> 38:27.426
Crystal clear.
Ah!

38:27.493 --> 38:28.427
Artie, are you--

38:28.494 --> 38:31.263
whoa, whoa.

38:31.331 --> 38:35.901
Good work on the ladle.

38:35.969 --> 38:37.703
Yeah, yeah.

38:37.770 --> 38:40.072
And I think I'm gonna
go to bed.

38:40.139 --> 38:41.807
Apparently falling
into a vat

38:41.874 --> 38:43.942
of bubbling poison kind
of takes it out of you.

38:44.010 --> 38:46.278
Uh, Claudia, wait.
I have something for you.

38:46.346 --> 38:48.347
College admissions
for South Dakota University.

38:48.414 --> 38:50.515
There's some online courses
in there too.

38:50.583 --> 38:52.551
So why the parental shove?

38:52.619 --> 38:54.786
Well, you need
a college degree

38:54.854 --> 38:57.222
to apply
for the Secret Service.

38:57.290 --> 38:59.191
Right.
Right.

38:59.258 --> 39:00.759
Okay.

39:00.827 --> 39:04.329
Um...Thanks for being
so hard on me out there.

39:04.397 --> 39:07.399
Turns out, you can take it.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.341
So I'm gonna go back
to the Warehouse.

39:16.409 --> 39:17.809
Do you want to come?
No, no, no.

39:17.877 --> 39:20.646
I, uh--I got a date
with...

39:20.713 --> 39:22.848
Kelly possibly.

39:22.915 --> 39:24.716
Yeah.

39:24.784 --> 39:27.152
Oh, I thought
she turned you down.

39:27.220 --> 39:28.186
Oh, no, no, no.
She did.

39:28.254 --> 39:29.921
She did.

39:29.989 --> 39:31.256
I just figured,
you know,

39:31.324 --> 39:34.059
sometimes people
can surprise you.

39:38.865 --> 39:42.434
Yeah, I guess sometimes
they do.

39:45.571 --> 39:48.006
â™ª â™ª

39:48.074 --> 39:52.277
You should be resting.

39:52.345 --> 39:56.515
This is resting for me.

39:56.582 --> 39:58.483
Okay, I rush all the way back
to remove an appendix

39:58.551 --> 40:00.385
from my favorite patient,
but apparently

40:00.453 --> 40:02.020
he did start without me.

40:02.088 --> 40:04.356
Mmm, yeah,
and I'm taking a long time

40:04.424 --> 40:06.124
to recover without you too.

40:06.192 --> 40:07.926
Not if you work
your meridians.

40:07.994 --> 40:08.960
I know.

40:09.028 --> 40:10.128
I'll tap all of the meridians

40:10.196 --> 40:12.064
and even the ticklish ones.

40:12.131 --> 40:13.965
You can have the next one.
I promise.

40:14.033 --> 40:16.101
Oh, thank you.
That's--

40:16.169 --> 40:18.370
I'm honored.

40:18.438 --> 40:22.307
Well, until next year then.

40:22.375 --> 40:24.109
Vanessa?

40:40.993 --> 40:43.862
I've been thinking
that, uh,

40:43.930 --> 40:46.798
you know, sometimes...

40:46.866 --> 40:49.167
I can be kind of obnoxious
in a really fun

40:49.235 --> 40:53.105
and entertaining way and since
it's already come up,

40:53.172 --> 40:55.373
you did mention
that I was cute.

40:55.441 --> 40:57.676
Although now that
I think about it,

40:57.744 --> 40:59.711
bunny rabbits
and kittens are cute,

40:59.779 --> 41:02.447
so maybe it wasn't he compliment
that I thought it was.

41:07.787 --> 41:11.022
Look, I'm just heading
into town.

41:11.090 --> 41:14.826
Do you want to come with me
for a little walk

41:14.894 --> 41:20.265
or a sit?

41:20.333 --> 41:23.702
Yeah, I'd like that.

41:23.770 --> 41:26.271
Good.

41:26.339 --> 41:27.672
But I'll drive.

41:27.740 --> 41:29.174
Yeah, you better.

41:41.053 --> 41:45.991
But here's the thing.

41:46.058 --> 41:48.560
I like you when
you're not being really

41:48.628 --> 41:50.162
unnecessarily mean to me.

41:50.229 --> 41:52.430
And I need to eat,
you know,

41:52.498 --> 41:56.401
and I figured, I don't know,
your species

41:56.469 --> 42:01.206
probably occasionally
eats too.

42:01.274 --> 42:04.910
So maybe the two of us could sit
down at the same table

42:04.977 --> 42:08.346
together and both eat.

42:19.225 --> 42:20.892
Fine.

42:20.960 --> 42:24.129
Eating at the same table...

42:24.197 --> 42:26.264
But nothing more
and don't get any ideas.

42:26.332 --> 42:28.133
I almost never do.

42:28.201 --> 42:30.702
Chinese place on main
and we're going dutch.

42:30.770 --> 42:33.471
Couldn't we go to
the Dutch place on Fifth

42:33.539 --> 42:35.207
and go Chinese?

42:35.274 --> 42:38.009
Come on, slappy,
before I change my mind.

42:38.077 --> 42:40.345
Hey, so when you said
I was cute,

42:40.413 --> 42:42.814
did you mean, like, kitten,
bunny rabbits cute or--
