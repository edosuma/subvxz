WEBVTT

00:12.560 --> 00:14.560
Hmm.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.980
Man,
space is cool and all,

00:18.080 --> 00:19.820
but the VHS selection
sucks.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.820
Boy: <i>Man, the selection</i>
<i>in this video store sucks.</i>

00:22.920 --> 00:24.920
Announcer: <i>Tired of watching</i>
<i>the same old movie?</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:26.540
Yeah.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.640
Announcer: Tired of walking
around like a sucker?

00:27.880 --> 00:29.300
Yeah.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.580
Announcer: Then it's time
to try Hover Boots!

00:31.680 --> 00:32.700
Hover Boots

00:32.800 --> 00:34.140
You'll get caught up in the

00:34.240 --> 00:35.780
Hover Boots

00:35.880 --> 00:37.020
Hover Boots

00:37.120 --> 00:38.300
Hover Boots!!

00:38.400 --> 00:40.720
Disclaimer ââ Hover Boots
are extremely dangerous.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.820
Aah!
( Buzzes )

00:43.920 --> 00:45.620
Oh, what? Denied?

00:45.720 --> 00:46.740
How much do these cost?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.620
500 space creds.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.660
How much do we have?

00:49.760 --> 00:51.820
Negativeâ200 space creds.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.380
Ugh!

00:53.480 --> 00:55.660
Sir, that's just a coupon.
( Buzzes )

00:55.760 --> 00:58.140
Sir, no, that's just a hat.
( Buzzes )

00:58.240 --> 00:59.540
Aah!

00:59.640 --> 01:02.340
Sir, no, your arm doesn't have
any credits on it.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.660
Just give us the boots!

01:03.760 --> 01:04.740
Rigby, no!

01:04.840 --> 01:06.180
Security!

01:06.280 --> 01:08.420
( Both groan )

01:08.520 --> 01:11.500
Dude, we have to get
those hover boots.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.820
Hey, Pops, can you transfer us
500 space creds each

01:13.920 --> 01:16.960
for some hover boots?
Hover boots?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.540
I'm afraid not.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.100
You'll trip and fall.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.340
I don't loan creds.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.580
Yeah.
And you'll sprain your ankles.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.940
Feel like this would set a bad
precedent for our relationship.

01:26.040 --> 01:29.140
No way. You two have to learn
the value of a space credit.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.180
What <i>isthe value</i>
of a space credit?

01:31.280 --> 01:33.060
Uh,
look, I don't know.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.740
Just don't waste your money
on junk!

01:36.840 --> 01:38.140
( Sighs )

01:38.240 --> 01:40.240
Maybe these hover boots
aren't worth it.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.620
Maybe you're right.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.580
Dudes, check out
my sweet new moves.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.380
( Grunting )

01:45.480 --> 01:46.980
Whooâhoo!

01:47.080 --> 01:49.080
You know, the fact that
they're so dangerous

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
only seems
to make them more fun.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.060
( Jamaican accent )
Sweet kicks, mon.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.480
There's a party going down
at the Jamaican dome tonight.

01:54.560 --> 01:55.780
You should stop by.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.780
All the coolest domers
are gonna be there,

01:57.880 --> 01:59.900
and you guys
are definitely cool.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.620
Oh, sweet!

02:01.720 --> 02:03.060
Hey, I want to go
to the party.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.420
Uh...no.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.020
It's more of
a small thing.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.120
Ugh, I want it
more than ever now!

02:09.400 --> 02:12.140
Ugh! How are we gonna get
any space credits?

02:12.240 --> 02:13.980
If you're willing to work
for the creds,

02:14.080 --> 02:16.080
I heard Professor Jacobs
in the greenhouse

02:15.920 --> 02:18.020
is looking for some help
with a secret project.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.480
Both: Hm! HmâHm! HmâHm!
HmâHmâHmâHmâHm!

02:21.480 --> 02:22.820
Jessica: In this greenhouse,

02:22.920 --> 02:25.860
we have vegetation
from every ecosystem on Earth.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.500
So, what, you need us to prune
your trees or something?

02:28.600 --> 02:30.460
( Laughs )
Something like that.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.940
Restricted access?

02:32.040 --> 02:32.940
( Beeps )

02:33.040 --> 02:36.380
Both: Whoooooooa!

02:36.480 --> 02:37.860
Huh?

02:37.960 --> 02:40.260
( Screeches )
Both: Aah!

02:40.360 --> 02:42.700
Stay behind the yellow line
and you'll be safe.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.380
( Screeches )

02:44.480 --> 02:45.620
What is that?

02:45.720 --> 02:47.860
A little experiment
of my own design.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.620
Unfortunately,
it ate Dr. Craig Jacobs,

02:50.720 --> 02:52.980
my lab mate and my...

02:53.080 --> 02:54.220
husband.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.320
( Dramatic soap opera music
plays )

02:55.440 --> 02:57.220
So, you want us
to kill it?

02:57.320 --> 02:58.900
Kill it?!
My baby?!

02:59.000 --> 03:00.260
No! Never!

03:00.360 --> 03:02.020
I nursed it
from a seedling.

03:02.120 --> 03:05.100
It represents the very pinnacle
of vegetative development.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.700
No. I need you to help me rescue
Craig by going inside it.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.740
How we gonna do that?

03:09.840 --> 03:11.580
By letting it eat you.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.500
( Both laugh )

03:13.600 --> 03:15.500
I'll pay you
500 space creds each.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.380
Okay, we'll do it.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.820
Here are your lasers.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.980
When you find Craig,
just radio me,

03:25.080 --> 03:27.940
and I'll turn this winch on
to pull you back out.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.780
Now,
if Craig is not alive,

03:29.880 --> 03:33.420
please bring back the
family necklace he had with him.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.820
It means a lot to me.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.620
If Craig's dead,
do we still get the creds?

03:36.720 --> 03:37.460
Ow!
Dude!

03:37.560 --> 03:38.660
What the heck, man?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.760
I'm just trying
to iron out the details.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.460
Don't worry.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.560
We'll bring you back
anything we find ââ promise.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.340
( Voice breaking )
Oh, thank you.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.820
( Screeching )

03:46.920 --> 03:49.660
Uh, maybe hover boots
aren't really worth all this.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.760
Dude, it's
about more than the shoes.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.280
It's about rescuing
that weird woman's husband

03:53.240 --> 03:55.240
or brother or whatever.
I wasn't listening.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.740
It's about never having to walk
to places ever again.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.340
It's about looking so cool that
we get invited to big parties.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.060
And it's
about getting those things

04:03.160 --> 04:05.620
by using
these sweet lasers.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.980
You're right.
Let's do this.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.340
( Growls )

04:10.440 --> 04:12.140
Aah!
Aah!

04:12.240 --> 04:14.220
It's so gross!

04:14.320 --> 04:16.700
Dude, get your elbow
out of my face!

04:16.800 --> 04:19.780
Aah!
Aah!

04:19.880 --> 04:22.220
Aah!
Aah!

04:22.320 --> 04:23.140
( Bodies thud )

04:23.240 --> 04:25.140
Ow.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.280
( Laser sputtering )

04:28.160 --> 04:30.540
Whoa.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.140
Uh, I'm scared.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.780
Let's just get this
over with.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.880
Just think about all the sweet
hover tricks we're gonna do

04:35.720 --> 04:37.940
once we get
all those space creds!

04:38.040 --> 04:41.020
Hover boots! Hover boots!
Hover boots! Hover boots!

04:41.120 --> 04:44.940
Hover boots! Hover boots!
Hover boots!

04:45.040 --> 04:46.860
What?!
That's insane.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.320
Everybody knows you find
the Sword of Unbreakability

04:49.400 --> 04:51.400
in the third dungeon
by beating the boss

04:51.160 --> 04:53.940
and pressing up, down, left,
right, B, A, B, A, B, A, start,

04:54.040 --> 04:55.960
unplugging controller one,
plugging it back in,

04:56.040 --> 04:58.000
and hitting select and start
at the same time.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.300
No, dude.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.400
That's how you get
the Wand of Unusual Effect,

05:01.160 --> 05:02.660
not the
Sword of Unbreakability.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.760
I feel like I don't even know
who you are right now.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.700
( Hissing )
Shh!

05:05.800 --> 05:07.540
Did you hear that?
You shh!

05:07.640 --> 05:08.500
Shh!
Shh!

05:08.600 --> 05:10.180
Shh!
Stop talking!

05:10.280 --> 05:11.700
( Hissing )

05:11.800 --> 05:13.580
Hey, I think
I just heard something.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.060
Yeah, no doy!

05:15.160 --> 05:16.340
Uh...

05:16.440 --> 05:17.940
Dude, nice job.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.220
( Groans )

05:19.320 --> 05:21.320
Uh, maybe we should
walk a little faster.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.080
No, let's walk
a lot faster.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.260
( Hisses )

05:25.360 --> 05:26.580
Aah!
Aah!

05:26.680 --> 05:28.020
Dude,
what is that?!

05:28.120 --> 05:29.860
Aah!
Aah!
( Creatures screeching )

05:29.960 --> 05:32.580
Uhâoh. Aah!
What do we do?

05:32.680 --> 05:34.180
Dude, we have lasers.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.460
Oh, right.
Time to take out the...

05:36.560 --> 05:37.380
Oh, wait.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.060
Time to...

05:39.160 --> 05:39.980
Smoke some bugs?

05:40.080 --> 05:41.900
Time to smoke some bugs.

05:42.000 --> 05:42.780
( Laser cocks )

05:51.000 --> 05:55.220
Whoooooooa!

05:55.320 --> 05:56.380
( Hisses )
Rigby, look out!

05:56.480 --> 05:58.840
( Slowâmotion )
Whaâaâaâaât?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.460
Whoa!

06:03.560 --> 06:06.960
That spear almost hit me
in the face!

06:07.800 --> 06:09.180
( Screeches )

06:09.280 --> 06:11.500
Both: Whoa.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.600
( Normal voice )
Hey, thanks, man.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.020
Hey, are you Craig?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.100
Craig?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.780
Craig.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.260
Yes, that ââ that's what they
called me outside the plant.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.740
Oh, cool. Your wife, Jessica,
sent us to rescue you.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.140
My wife?

06:24.240 --> 06:26.360
( Laughing )

06:29.560 --> 06:30.780
Um, we were ââ

06:30.880 --> 06:32.820
( Laughing )
Wait, wait.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.920
( Laughing )

06:36.120 --> 06:37.460
Phew!

06:37.560 --> 06:40.580
Dang, I nearly busted a gut
over here.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.900
( Sniffles )
Oh, sorry.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.420
I've just been stuck down here
alone for so long.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.180
Just me
and those dumb bugs.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.580
( Breathing heavily )

06:50.680 --> 06:52.300
Whoa, okay, man.
Take it easy.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.300
Uh...

06:53.400 --> 06:54.700
What were we talking
about?

06:54.800 --> 06:55.620
We were about to ââ

06:55.720 --> 06:57.580
Jessica.
That's right.

06:57.680 --> 07:01.700
Yeah. She <i>wasmy wife,</i>
but not anymore!

07:01.800 --> 07:05.500
Not after the incident.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.740
Jess,
this has gone too far.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.300
I mean,
look at this thing.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.380
It's unnatural.
( Grunts )

07:11.480 --> 07:13.900
Don't you dare say that
about our baby.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.020
Ever since we got to space,
these experiments

07:16.120 --> 07:18.380
have gotten further and further
out of control.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.620
It needs to stop!

07:20.720 --> 07:23.180
And this abomination needs
to be destroyed!

07:23.280 --> 07:25.780
You'll never take my baby away
from me.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.980
Never!

07:27.080 --> 07:28.500
( Grunts )

07:28.600 --> 07:29.860
( Gasps ) No!

07:29.960 --> 07:32.420
You always loved this necklace
more than me.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.180
Now you'll never see
it again!

07:34.280 --> 07:35.180
( Laughing )

07:35.280 --> 07:37.100
( Growls )
No!

07:37.200 --> 07:39.200
( Laughing )

07:41.760 --> 07:44.180
It feels like
it only happened yesterday.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.620
When <i>didthis happen?</i>

07:45.720 --> 07:47.020
Yesterday.
Wait. What?

07:47.120 --> 07:48.700
How'd you lose
your clothes already?

07:48.800 --> 07:49.860
Yeah,
you look terrible.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.860
Living in space
is one thing,

07:51.960 --> 07:55.700
but living in a giant monster
plant messes you up, man.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.700
Uh...well, we're just doing this
to make some space creds, so...

07:58.800 --> 08:01.900
( Laughs )
Jessica doesn't have any money.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.500
Ah, what?

08:03.600 --> 08:06.700
She only sent you down here to
get her diamond necklace back.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.900
She spent all her money
on this gross plant.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.940
But if you guys help me
get out of here,

08:11.040 --> 08:12.740
I'll pay you
whatever she offered.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.860
Uh...all right.
Deal.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.420
Yeah, we don't really care
as long as we get paid.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.100
Now let's get the heck
out of here.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.200
( Radio crackles )
Come in, Jessica.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.300
We're ready for evac.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.400
I repeat.
We're ready for evac. Over.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.460
( Chuckles evilly )

08:26.560 --> 08:28.980
( Screeches )

08:29.080 --> 08:30.180
( Both scream )

08:30.280 --> 08:33.260
( Both groan )

08:33.360 --> 08:35.540
( Laser cocks )
Uhâoh.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.100
Hello, boys.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.220
Why don't you slide that laser
pack over nice and slowly?

08:40.320 --> 08:43.260
No problem.
We don't want any trouble.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.260
Very good.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.260
Now, where's my necklace?

08:46.360 --> 08:49.220
Don't worry.
We got it right there.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.820
( Gasps ) Craig?

08:50.920 --> 08:52.100
( Grunts )

08:52.200 --> 08:53.140
( Grunts )

08:53.240 --> 08:55.940
You're ââ You're alive?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.580
Looking for this?

08:58.680 --> 08:59.900
( Twinkle! )

09:00.000 --> 09:01.300
( Gasps )

09:01.400 --> 09:03.580
Give me that necklace, Craig,
or else!

09:03.680 --> 09:06.380
Jess, please,
stop this madness.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.540
You were
a good person once.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.020
Remember
when we got to space?

09:11.120 --> 09:13.180
That was an entire week ago,
Craig.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.420
I've changed.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.760
Now it's just me
and my plants.

09:19.920 --> 09:20.700
My necklace!

09:20.800 --> 09:21.540
( Panting )

09:21.640 --> 09:22.980
( Grunts ) Aah!

09:23.080 --> 09:23.780
( Growls )

09:23.880 --> 09:24.940
Rigby, over here!

09:25.040 --> 09:25.980
( Grunts )

09:26.080 --> 09:26.780
Ha, ha!

09:26.880 --> 09:27.780
( Groans )

09:27.880 --> 09:29.220
Hey, lady.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.220
Catch!

09:32.320 --> 09:33.180
Finally.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.140
( Laughs )

09:35.240 --> 09:36.540
( Plant monster growls )

09:36.640 --> 09:37.740
Oh, no.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.100
Jess, no!
Look out!

09:39.200 --> 09:40.100
Jess!
Aah!

09:40.200 --> 09:41.660
Ooh.
Ooh.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.820
Aah!

09:42.920 --> 09:44.920
I'm coming, Jess!

09:45.880 --> 09:47.460
Ooh.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.860
Hang on, Jess!

09:48.960 --> 09:50.500
( Grunts )
I've got ya!

09:50.600 --> 09:53.660
After everything I did,
you still want to save me?

09:53.760 --> 09:54.740
Of course, Jess.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.340
I can't live another day
without you.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.060
Oh, Craig.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.820
Let's just start a new life
together inside this plant.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.180
Do you really mean it?

10:03.280 --> 10:05.980
Yes.
Let's never be apart again.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.060
Look, I know you guys just went
on a roller coaster of emotions,

10:09.160 --> 10:10.580
but is someone
gonna pay us?

10:10.680 --> 10:13.220
Yeah, we're trying
to buy some hover boots.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.580
Sure. I'll transfer the creds
right now.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.700
( Device beeps )

10:16.800 --> 10:18.180
But, oh,
be careful!

10:18.280 --> 10:21.400
I heard those things
are really dangerous!

10:22.360 --> 10:23.900
Pfft.
Dangerous?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.740
These aren't dangerous.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.380
Both: HmâHm! HmâHm! Hm!

10:27.480 --> 10:28.980
Oh!
Oh!

10:29.080 --> 10:31.700
( Both groan )

10:31.800 --> 10:33.500
( Both grunt )
