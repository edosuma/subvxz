WEBVTT

00:00.609 --> 00:02.539
<i>The best part of being a party planner</i>

00:02.625 --> 00:05.515
is taking stuff home...
leftovers, free flowers...

00:05.586 --> 00:08.265
And when would we ever splurge
on a mini balloon archway?

00:08.328 --> 00:10.127
Hmm.

00:10.196 --> 00:12.263
Look at this, Trip got my reviews

00:12.365 --> 00:14.308
on "Little Shop of Horrors"
framed for me!

00:16.234 --> 00:18.635
The school newspaper
says it was "a triumph"!

00:18.692 --> 00:21.426
And the Westport Gazette says
it was "maybe worth seeing".

00:21.495 --> 00:22.494
That's great!

00:22.596 --> 00:24.062
We're so proud of you.

00:24.164 --> 00:26.498
This just confirms exactly
what I've been thinking...

00:26.567 --> 00:27.899
I'm not gonna go to college

00:27.968 --> 00:29.534
so I can concentrate
on becoming a singer!

00:29.603 --> 00:32.503
For the thousandth time,
you are going to college.

00:32.606 --> 00:34.005
Or... hear me out...

00:34.107 --> 00:35.674
I can take my college fund

00:35.776 --> 00:37.208
and go to L.A. and become a singer!

00:37.311 --> 00:39.611
If anybody's taking your college
fund and blowing it on a trip,

00:39.680 --> 00:40.612
it's gonna be me.

00:40.714 --> 00:42.981
I'm not stupid. I have a plan.

00:43.050 --> 00:45.383
I'm gonna go on "American Idol",
sing my heart out,

00:45.485 --> 00:47.352
leave with a golden ticket, boom!

00:47.421 --> 00:48.620
Pop star.

00:48.689 --> 00:51.356
Then I meet a charming man
on a flight from Paris.

00:51.425 --> 00:53.825
Second boom... He's the King of Sweden.

00:53.927 --> 00:54.859
I'm a Queen.

00:54.962 --> 00:56.294
That's not how it works,

00:56.363 --> 00:57.862
and you still have to go to college.

00:57.931 --> 00:59.531
Well, Katy Perry didn't go to college.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.933
In fact, she dropped out
of high school to pursue music.

01:02.002 --> 01:04.501
You can have an amazing voice
and still never make it!

01:04.605 --> 01:06.204
That's why it's important
for you to have an education

01:06.273 --> 01:08.106
- to fall back on.
- You're my parents.

01:08.175 --> 01:10.408
Aren't you supposed to tell me
that dreams are worth fighting for

01:10.510 --> 01:11.710
and that I should believe in myself?

01:11.778 --> 01:13.511
- Nah.
- Unh-unh.

01:13.614 --> 01:15.647
Dreamcrushers!

01:18.585 --> 01:21.119
Sure, we're making our kid miserable,

01:21.221 --> 01:24.823
but we're doing it together.

01:29.930 --> 01:31.963
- Hi, what's your name?
- Taylor Otto.

01:32.065 --> 01:33.231
And where are you from?

01:33.333 --> 01:34.432
I'm from Westport, Connecticut.

01:34.534 --> 01:35.667
And how young are you?

01:35.769 --> 01:37.280
- Um, I'm 17.
- 17?

01:37.359 --> 01:38.470
- Ah, 17.
- Yep.

01:38.530 --> 01:39.562
What are you gonna sing for us?

01:39.640 --> 01:40.874
"The Climb" by Miley Cyrus.

01:40.907 --> 01:42.774
All right, go for it.

01:42.876 --> 01:46.211
♪ I can almost see it ♪

01:46.313 --> 01:49.414
♪ That dream I'm dreaming, but ♪

01:49.516 --> 01:52.017
♪ There's a voice
inside my head say... ♪

01:52.119 --> 01:54.552
Okay. Thank you. That's enough.

01:54.655 --> 01:56.888
Mom?! Dad?! Where are the judges?!

01:56.990 --> 01:58.089
We are the judges.

01:58.191 --> 02:00.291
Let me just tell you something.

02:00.394 --> 02:02.327
That, um... I was not feeling that.

02:02.429 --> 02:04.696
No, it made my ears... sad.

02:04.798 --> 02:06.364
Yeah, you should just go to college.

02:06.466 --> 02:08.400
Following your dreams is overrated.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.001
- I agree with that 100%.
- Mm-hmm.

02:10.103 --> 02:12.771
I wish Lionel, Katy, and Luke
were my parents!

02:12.796 --> 02:13.822
Well, they're not.

02:15.876 --> 02:17.642
Dreamcrushers!

02:22.849 --> 02:24.649
Hey, Kate-orade.

02:24.751 --> 02:27.185
This is why people keep
reporting you to HR, Kevin.

02:27.287 --> 02:28.520
Right. Right.

02:28.622 --> 02:29.754
- Anyway...
- Mm-hmm.

02:29.856 --> 02:31.656
...Whitney wants to see you.
She is in your office.

02:31.758 --> 02:34.225
Ah, it's probably just another
Westport housewife

02:34.327 --> 02:37.162
wanting to throw another party
with another fountain.

02:37.264 --> 02:39.230
I want a pink chocolate fountain...

02:39.332 --> 02:40.732
A what?

02:40.834 --> 02:42.367
A Pouilly-Fuissé fountain.

02:42.469 --> 02:43.935
What's that now?

02:44.037 --> 02:45.603
A bone broth fountain.

02:45.706 --> 02:47.138
Whaaat?

02:47.240 --> 02:49.407
A La Mer face serum fountain.

02:49.509 --> 02:51.576
Katie, maybe you could try some!

02:51.678 --> 02:52.911
Hide those frown lines.

02:55.582 --> 02:56.748
<i>Katie!</i>

02:56.850 --> 03:00.018
<i>I'm on medical leave again...</i>

03:00.120 --> 03:04.556
<i>You think the camera
can't see you there, Kevin?</i>

03:04.658 --> 03:06.991
Oh, hey, how's it going?

03:07.094 --> 03:08.393
Did you get my Edible Arrangement?

03:08.495 --> 03:10.161
- <i>Shut up, Kevin.</i>
- On it.

03:10.263 --> 03:12.997
<i>Katie, I need you to take over
an event for me.</i>

03:13.100 --> 03:15.361
<i>It's the Westport
Businesswomen's Awards.</i>

03:15.440 --> 03:18.703
Oh! I'm so excited I get to do something

03:18.805 --> 03:20.739
honoring my fellow working women.

03:20.841 --> 03:22.307
You can count on me, Whitney!

03:22.409 --> 03:23.374
<i>Great.</i>

03:23.477 --> 03:24.876
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,</i>

03:24.978 --> 03:26.644
<i>they're injecting the anesthesia.</i>

03:26.713 --> 03:28.580
Are you calling me
from the operating table?

03:28.648 --> 03:33.051
<i>10, 9, 8... 7...</i>

03:37.023 --> 03:39.557
And now Taylor thinks
that she can skip college

03:39.659 --> 03:42.694
and become a pop star
and "follow her dreams".

03:42.763 --> 03:44.696
This whole dream thing is BS.

03:44.765 --> 03:47.165
I'm not raising wussies like
everyone else in this town.

03:47.267 --> 03:48.833
Sure, I get them music lessons

03:48.935 --> 03:50.635
but not so they can become musicians.

03:50.737 --> 03:52.904
I do it so they learn discipline,

03:53.006 --> 03:54.939
focus, and hard work.

03:55.041 --> 03:57.008
My mom did the same for me,
and I turned out great.

03:57.110 --> 03:58.276
- Uh...
- Okay, look.

03:58.378 --> 03:59.444
If you try and shut Taylor down,

03:59.513 --> 04:01.246
she might run off
and pursue her dream anyway.

04:01.348 --> 04:03.548
My cousin wanted to be a dancer,
so she ran away from home,

04:03.650 --> 04:04.749
and now she's a Rockette.

04:04.851 --> 04:05.917
Well, that's a pretty big deal.

04:05.986 --> 04:08.453
No. She's a Rock-ette.

04:08.555 --> 04:10.255
That's what they call strippers
in Little Rock.

04:11.491 --> 04:14.592
So telling her "no"
might backfire on me?

04:14.694 --> 04:15.860
It's not enough to injure a dream.

04:15.962 --> 04:18.163
You have to kill it slowly
but completely.

04:18.231 --> 04:19.697
Like my kids did with those hermit crabs

04:19.766 --> 04:21.232
they smuggled in from Mexico.

04:21.334 --> 04:23.134
How am I supposed to do that?

04:23.236 --> 04:24.636
I'll just loan you Ms. Belt,

04:24.738 --> 04:25.904
my kids' music teacher.

04:25.972 --> 04:27.806
She sucks all the joy out of music.

04:27.874 --> 04:29.307
She's a real throwback to the Golden Age

04:29.376 --> 04:31.109
of truly abusive educators.

04:31.211 --> 04:33.011
Oh.

04:33.079 --> 04:35.046
You're not gonna believe this.
Abe Henderson died.

04:35.115 --> 04:36.147
Who's Abe Henderson?

04:36.249 --> 04:38.016
He was in charge
of keeping supply lines open

04:38.084 --> 04:39.584
for our regiment.

04:39.686 --> 04:40.819
He ordered our lunches.

04:40.921 --> 04:42.620
The Historical Guild
is losing people left and right.

04:42.722 --> 04:44.222
We need new, young members.

04:44.324 --> 04:46.157
So, I had this brainstorm.

04:46.259 --> 04:47.859
I made these scrolls,

04:47.928 --> 04:49.327
and I'm gonna put them up
all over town...

04:49.429 --> 04:51.196
Yeah, kids will totally go for that.

04:51.264 --> 04:52.864
Scrolls are so in right now.

04:52.966 --> 04:54.699
It's not so crazy
people would like scrolls.

04:54.801 --> 04:56.100
It's the most fun kind of paper.

04:56.169 --> 04:58.503
Dad, if you really want to get
through to young people,

04:58.572 --> 05:00.905
you should make a video
and post it on social media.

05:00.974 --> 05:03.241
Right. The key is to make
something that goes viral,

05:03.343 --> 05:04.609
so it has to be memorable.

05:04.711 --> 05:05.910
Flashy, but never desperate.

05:06.012 --> 05:07.345
Funny without trying too hard.

05:07.414 --> 05:08.479
Quirky, but not lame.

05:08.582 --> 05:09.814
Got it.

05:09.916 --> 05:11.249
Can we revisit the scrolls?

05:11.318 --> 05:12.383
I made 50 of them.

05:12.485 --> 05:15.053
Taylor, I have been thinking

05:15.155 --> 05:16.855
about our conversation yesterday.

05:16.957 --> 05:18.590
If you want to be a singer,

05:18.658 --> 05:19.691
you gotta work at it,

05:19.793 --> 05:22.861
so I got you a couple of music lessons

05:22.929 --> 05:24.729
with the person who teaches Doris' kids.

05:24.831 --> 05:26.831
That is so awesome. Thank you, Mom!

05:28.602 --> 05:30.301
- What was that?
- Oh, I was writing a song

05:30.403 --> 05:31.669
about what a terrible mom you are.

05:31.771 --> 05:33.071
But now I'm gonna throw it out.

05:34.207 --> 05:36.207
You might want to keep it.

05:36.309 --> 05:37.442
It's just Monday.

05:41.715 --> 05:43.715
So this is the music space
I built for my kids.

05:43.817 --> 05:46.117
Wow, Doris.
You are such a supportive mom.

05:46.219 --> 05:48.720
Yeah, sure! Whatever.

05:51.091 --> 05:52.223
Hi.

05:52.325 --> 05:54.025
You don't use your voice
unless you're singing.

05:54.794 --> 05:56.561
Get out while you can.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.000
I didn't even know

06:02.068 --> 06:04.702
there was a Businesswomen's
Association in Westport!

06:04.804 --> 06:07.472
I can't wait to meet them
and talk shop and...

06:09.000 --> 06:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:18.585 --> 06:20.051
I must be in the wrong place.

06:20.153 --> 06:22.186
I'm looking for businesswomen.

06:22.289 --> 06:24.032
We are the businesswomen.

06:24.087 --> 06:25.356
Mm-hmm.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.691
No, you're not.

06:26.793 --> 06:28.526
Buying things from businesses

06:28.628 --> 06:29.928
doesn't make you businesswomen.

06:30.030 --> 06:33.264
If you recall, I made all that
peppermint bark last year.

06:33.366 --> 06:35.777
And I got all caught up in that
Ponzi scheme, remember?

06:35.801 --> 06:37.488
- Mm-hmm.
- And I just thought of the name

06:37.537 --> 06:39.437
of the jewelry business
that I might start.

06:39.539 --> 06:41.739
"Glamville" by Nancy Granville.

06:41.841 --> 06:43.708
I know! It's so good.

06:45.679 --> 06:48.367
Katie, I'm just gonna do this.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.649
This is still a party
celebrating working women,

06:52.751 --> 06:55.467
so I was thinking we could do a seminar

06:55.577 --> 06:58.011
with successful Mom-preneurs, and...

06:58.080 --> 07:00.914
Oh, Katie, it's really not
that kind of a thing.

07:00.982 --> 07:03.249
This is the kind of party
where we drink champagne

07:03.318 --> 07:05.919
and honor each other for important
work we do in Westport.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.120
Mm.

07:07.222 --> 07:08.455
For example...

07:08.557 --> 07:11.091
Last year, I received
a lifetime achievement award.

07:11.193 --> 07:13.860
- For what?
- For all of my achievements.

07:13.962 --> 07:15.228
Don't worry about us.

07:15.330 --> 07:16.996
You just need to figure out a fountain

07:17.099 --> 07:18.231
that has never been done before.

07:18.333 --> 07:21.776
Sure. I will get right on that.

07:21.877 --> 07:24.044
<i>I'm not sure what kind
of fountain I'm doing yet...</i>

07:24.139 --> 07:26.206
<i>but there's definitely
going to be pee in it.</i>

07:28.844 --> 07:30.677
Today...

07:30.779 --> 07:33.380
you will sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat".

07:35.384 --> 07:37.917
You will start when I say "start".

07:37.986 --> 07:39.519
Good.

07:44.526 --> 07:46.259
Start... now.

07:46.328 --> 07:47.861
- ♪ Row ♪
- Off pitch. Again.

07:47.929 --> 07:49.262
- ♪ Row ♪
- No. Again.

07:49.331 --> 07:50.263
♪ Row ♪

07:50.365 --> 07:52.866
Until I hear perfect "rows,"

07:52.968 --> 07:54.100
no boat for you.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.635
Now, row! Again.

07:55.737 --> 07:57.237
- ♪ Row ♪
- No! Again!

07:57.339 --> 07:58.638
- ♪ Row ♪
- No!

07:59.808 --> 08:00.840
♪ Row ♪

08:03.812 --> 08:05.645
I've been playing the same note

08:05.747 --> 08:07.213
for six months.

08:09.167 --> 08:10.817
<i>The Fun is coming,</i>

08:10.886 --> 08:11.918
<i>The Fun is coming...</i>

08:12.020 --> 08:14.254
<i>to the Westport Historical Guild.</i>

08:14.356 --> 08:15.889
<i>So saddle up your steed</i>

08:15.991 --> 08:19.025
<i>and take a ride through history.</i>

08:19.127 --> 08:20.593
<i>What does membership entail?</i>

08:20.662 --> 08:23.029
<i>Fear not, for I shall
explain it all to you,</i>

08:23.131 --> 08:24.964
<i>in just 90 short minutes.</i>

08:25.066 --> 08:26.299
90 minutes?!

08:26.401 --> 08:29.068
I know. Don't worry. It's only Part One.

08:30.305 --> 08:32.238
We'll just do the video for you.

08:32.307 --> 08:33.773
But I thought mine was good.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.943
This lack of self-awareness
is part of the problem, Greg.

08:40.849 --> 08:43.283
They approved my idea
for a kombucha fountain.

08:43.385 --> 08:44.484
I'm surprised you know what that is.

08:44.586 --> 08:45.652
I didn't.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.353
I Googled "What do idiots
love to drink?"

08:47.422 --> 08:49.022
Kombucha was the first thing
that came up.

08:51.259 --> 08:52.792
How was the lesson?

08:52.861 --> 08:54.160
The worst.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.129
I'll never make it
as a professional singer.

08:56.198 --> 08:58.598
I can't even sing
"Row, Row, Row Your Boat".

08:58.700 --> 09:00.200
Guess I'll have to figure out
something else

09:00.302 --> 09:01.501
to spend my college fund on.

09:01.603 --> 09:02.469
College!

09:02.571 --> 09:03.937
You're going to spend it on college!

09:08.510 --> 09:10.643
Wow, that Ms. Belt really delivered.

09:10.745 --> 09:12.278
Maybe I can send you to Ms. Belt

09:12.347 --> 09:15.181
to break your love of whistling
while you trim your nose hairs.

09:17.152 --> 09:18.685
It's not a chore if you're cheerful!

09:29.431 --> 09:31.331
You're not gonna hang those up?

09:31.399 --> 09:33.032
What's the point?

09:33.101 --> 09:35.668
I really thought singing
was gonna be my career.

09:35.737 --> 09:38.872
It's something I'm good at.
At least, I thought I was.

09:38.940 --> 09:40.340
That teacher didn't believe in me.

09:40.442 --> 09:42.408
Don't be so hard on yourself.

09:42.511 --> 09:45.378
You always say if you have your
dream job, then it's not work.

09:45.447 --> 09:47.480
Dad has his dream job,

09:47.582 --> 09:48.481
you have yours...

09:48.583 --> 09:49.516
Yeah.

09:49.618 --> 09:51.784
I thought I found mine.

09:51.887 --> 09:53.953
Oh, honey...

09:54.022 --> 09:57.457
there are plenty of things
that you are good at.

09:57.559 --> 09:59.792
Like what?

09:59.895 --> 10:01.611
Oh, honey...

11:21.710 --> 11:23.109
- That last note. Come on.
- Thank you.

11:23.211 --> 11:25.578
- I appreciate it.
- Uh, Luke, what do you think?

11:25.647 --> 11:27.380
We knew the big note was coming.

11:27.482 --> 11:29.182
I didn't know... "Can she get there?"

11:29.284 --> 11:30.350
and you got there.

11:30.452 --> 11:31.517
Thank you.

11:31.620 --> 11:33.686
- Good job.
- I always like those surprises,

11:33.788 --> 11:35.388
but you're a natural at this.

11:35.490 --> 11:36.789
- You know that. Very good.
- Yeah.

11:36.891 --> 11:39.592
Uh, Taylor, when I was 17,

11:39.694 --> 11:41.427
I had the same type of dream.

11:41.529 --> 11:43.630
I was gonna do it.
I was gonna go for it.

11:43.732 --> 11:45.031
I needed someone to believe in me,

11:45.133 --> 11:47.467
- and I really believe in you.
- Thank you.

11:47.569 --> 11:48.935
- So should we give our vote?
- Let's do it.

11:49.037 --> 11:50.670
- Okay. Go ahead.
- I'm ready.

11:50.772 --> 11:51.738
I'm a yes.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.339
- Yes?
- Yes.

11:53.441 --> 11:54.574
I'm a yes.

11:54.676 --> 11:57.343
And I'm ready. I'm a yes!

11:57.445 --> 11:59.512
- You're going to Hollywood, Taylor!
- You're going to Hollywood! Come on!

11:59.614 --> 12:01.714
- Thank you so much!
- Congratulations. All right.

12:01.794 --> 12:03.700
That'll be something you can take
home to your mom and dad.

12:03.724 --> 12:04.852
For sure. Will do.

12:04.853 --> 12:06.119
- Yeah.
- Enjoy the ride.

12:06.221 --> 12:07.754
- Have a great night. Yeah.
- Take care. Very good.

12:07.856 --> 12:09.622
Oh, my gosh.

12:09.724 --> 12:11.758
Hey! Congratulations!

12:11.860 --> 12:13.593
Thank you so much! I can't believe it.

12:13.695 --> 12:16.029
How does it feel to be holding
the golden ticket?

12:16.131 --> 12:18.464
It feels like a dream.

12:18.566 --> 12:19.632
Oh, no...

12:21.503 --> 12:22.535
It was a dream, Luthor,

12:22.637 --> 12:24.137
but I'm gonna get there for real.

12:24.239 --> 12:25.571
Damn right you are!

12:28.133 --> 12:29.208
Can you talk?!

12:35.524 --> 12:37.392
And the award for

12:37.466 --> 12:40.592
"Best idea For A Business
If eBay Wasn't Already A Thing"

12:40.655 --> 12:42.779
goes to... Nancy Granville!

12:46.316 --> 12:48.316
Uch! Kombucha.

12:55.638 --> 12:57.638
- Wh-Where's the rest of it?
- That's it.

12:57.707 --> 12:59.907
Well, how will people know
when the meetings are

12:59.983 --> 13:01.616
or where to sign up for
the Westport Historical Guild?

13:01.677 --> 13:03.877
- That was the whole point of this.
- They will look it up. Trust me.

13:03.918 --> 13:05.284
Here's what people care about
on the Internet...

13:05.352 --> 13:07.319
parkour fails
and dogs dressed as people.

13:07.421 --> 13:08.620
Well, I really don't get it,

13:08.689 --> 13:10.856
but if you guys believe in it,
I guess I trust you.

13:10.925 --> 13:13.692
Millard Fillmore dressed up
his Beagle in a tuxedo,

13:13.761 --> 13:15.294
so, you know,
there's historical precedent.

13:15.362 --> 13:18.500
Dad, you are the Snapple cap of people.

13:24.338 --> 13:26.205
She's going to be here any minute.

13:26.307 --> 13:28.373
- Stop smiling!
- I can't.

13:28.442 --> 13:30.776
I had a dream last night that
I auditioned for "American Idol"

13:30.878 --> 13:32.611
and Katy Perry said she believed in me!

13:32.713 --> 13:33.779
I can do this!

13:33.881 --> 13:35.247
I can feel her vibration.

13:35.349 --> 13:37.349
She's coming! Ms. Belt is coming!

13:46.760 --> 13:47.726
You came back.

13:47.828 --> 13:48.927
And you're smiling.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.596
Well, we'll take care of that.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.364
Begin with "Row".

13:52.433 --> 13:53.498
- ♪ Row ♪
- No!

13:53.567 --> 13:54.733
Again!

13:54.802 --> 13:56.001
♪ Row, row ♪

13:56.070 --> 13:58.003
How dare you do a second "row"?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.740
♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪

14:01.842 --> 14:03.909
♪ Gently down the stream ♪

14:03.978 --> 14:06.445
- Stop that right now!
- ♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ♪

14:06.547 --> 14:08.747
♪ Life is but a dream ♪

14:08.816 --> 14:10.306
- ♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪
- What are you doing?

14:10.330 --> 14:11.217
What are you three doing?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.552
- ♪ Gently down the stream ♪
- Put them down. Put... those...

14:13.621 --> 14:15.921
- ♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ♪
- ...instruments... down!

14:15.990 --> 14:18.557
♪ Life is but a dream ♪

14:18.659 --> 14:22.661
- Excuse me!
- ♪ Ooh, ohh ♪

14:22.730 --> 14:25.030
♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪

14:25.132 --> 14:27.399
♪ Gently down the stream ♪

14:27.501 --> 14:29.701
♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ♪

14:29.803 --> 14:32.204
♪ Life is but a dream ♪

14:32.273 --> 14:36.875
♪ Life is but a dream ♪

14:40.381 --> 14:42.114
That was pretty good.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.218
You!

14:47.588 --> 14:49.955
What the hell have you done?

14:50.024 --> 14:52.624
You and your "joy"
have ruined everything!

14:54.061 --> 14:56.161
Your father said I was crazy
when I wanted to build

14:56.263 --> 14:58.096
this soundproof room
with a two-way mirror

14:58.198 --> 14:59.998
to keep an eye on things. Well...

15:00.067 --> 15:01.800
who's crazy now?!

15:01.902 --> 15:03.502
Aah! Fired!

15:06.106 --> 15:07.139
And the award for

15:07.207 --> 15:09.341
"Best Acceptance Speech from Last Year"

15:09.410 --> 15:10.976
goes to...

15:11.045 --> 15:12.277
Oh, my gosh!

15:12.346 --> 15:13.545
It's me!

15:18.419 --> 15:19.885
Oh, thank you.

15:21.722 --> 15:23.288
Hopefully this is like that movie

15:23.390 --> 15:25.524
where someone calls you,
and if you answer, you die.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.193
Damn!

15:28.262 --> 15:29.895
Hi, Doris.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.097
Ms. Belt was supposed
to make singing so hard

15:32.199 --> 15:33.832
it broke Taylor, but instead,

15:33.901 --> 15:36.601
Taylor broke Ms. Belt
with her passion and her dreams!

15:36.704 --> 15:39.004
Well, it's not a chore
if you're cheerful.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.273
<i>Am I quoting Greg's
nose-hair trimming mantra?</i>

15:41.342 --> 15:43.041
Well, I won't have it in my house.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.077
<i>Man, I think I played this wrong.</i>

15:45.145 --> 15:46.244
Gotta go, Doris.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.347
You owe me three demoralized children!

15:48.415 --> 15:50.315
And I know somewhere inside me

15:50.384 --> 15:52.184
is that little girl from Tennessee,

15:52.286 --> 15:54.720
who never could've seen
herself standing here...

15:54.822 --> 15:56.488
- Enough of that.
- I'm not done.

15:56.590 --> 15:59.057
This was supposed to be an event

15:59.126 --> 16:01.660
about women supporting women,

16:01.729 --> 16:04.496
and I haven't been the most
supportive woman myself.

16:04.565 --> 16:06.698
My daughter told me her dream,

16:06.800 --> 16:08.367
and I tried to crush it.

16:08.469 --> 16:10.669
Instead of crushing her dreams,

16:10.738 --> 16:14.139
I should follow her lead
and find one of my own.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.640
We all should.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.142
You're intelligent women.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.378
Should you really be giving
yourselves awards

16:19.480 --> 16:20.812
for doing nothing?

16:20.881 --> 16:22.047
Come on!

16:22.116 --> 16:23.849
Sage, you sound stupid,

16:23.917 --> 16:25.751
but there's gotta be
some brains in your head.

16:25.853 --> 16:27.219
Thank you!

16:27.321 --> 16:29.654
And, Nancy, take "Glamville"

16:29.723 --> 16:31.423
and actually do something with it!

16:31.492 --> 16:33.959
You're right.
I have a real responsibility.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.895
I think the world needs
"Glamville" now more than ever.

16:36.964 --> 16:39.531
Suzanne, you are so much better

16:39.633 --> 16:42.501
than repackaging store-bought
peppermint bark as your own.

16:42.603 --> 16:43.502
You know?

16:43.570 --> 16:45.137
Oh, everybody knows.

16:45.239 --> 16:46.738
And, Tara...

16:46.807 --> 16:48.807
I think you'd be amazing

16:48.876 --> 16:50.609
at jumping off a bridge

16:50.677 --> 16:54.780
and hitting as many things
as possible on the way down.

16:54.848 --> 16:58.150
Ladies, you've gotta find your dreams,

16:58.218 --> 16:59.551
and I do, too.

16:59.653 --> 17:02.254
Because it is not... this.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.991
Come on, Kevin.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.893
I don't know if you're going
for a "Jerry Maguire" thing,

17:07.961 --> 17:10.429
but... you complete me, Kate-orade!

17:11.598 --> 17:13.509
I'll report myself to HR.

17:14.435 --> 17:16.034
I can't tell. How's the video doing?

17:16.103 --> 17:17.769
Well, it's actually gotten
a lot of views.

17:17.838 --> 17:20.472
The unofficial fan site for
the GEICO Lizard retweeted it.

17:20.574 --> 17:21.640
But no one's signed up yet.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.209
In school, we're forced
to learn history...

17:24.310 --> 17:26.044
no one wants to do it for fun.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.480
I guess the Guild will go the
way many of its members did...

17:28.549 --> 17:30.348
neglected by their caretakers.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.559
Hey! Two people just signed up!

17:40.661 --> 17:43.395
Oliver Otto and Anna-Kat Otto.

17:43.464 --> 17:44.663
We saw how much it meant to you,

17:44.765 --> 17:46.031
so we thought we'd give it a shot.

17:46.133 --> 17:49.134
Thanks. I don't know what to say.

17:49.159 --> 17:50.179
Come here.

17:50.204 --> 17:51.403
Ahh.

17:51.472 --> 17:53.271
You guys are not gonna regret this.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.873
We're having a mutton truck on Thursday.

17:54.942 --> 17:56.942
It's just fried chicken,
but we're pretending!

18:00.447 --> 18:01.847
Hey. How was the event?

18:01.949 --> 18:04.416
I might've quit. I'm not sure.

18:04.518 --> 18:05.951
Okay.

18:06.053 --> 18:07.419
Well,

18:07.521 --> 18:08.920
let me know so I can
change the family back

18:09.022 --> 18:11.156
to generic phone charger cables.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.526
You guys will not believe
what happened today...

18:14.628 --> 18:17.362
First, I want to apologize
for not supporting your dreams.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.064
If you don't want to go to college

18:19.166 --> 18:21.032
and instead pursue singing,

18:21.134 --> 18:23.535
that is fine with your father and me.

18:23.637 --> 18:25.070
- It is?!
- Mm-hmm.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.738
Why do I always feel like
I've missed a meeting?

18:26.840 --> 18:29.875
No, I will go to college. But for music.

18:29.977 --> 18:32.677
Ms. Belt was telling me about
all these great music programs.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.279
Oh, and there's this one at this school

18:34.381 --> 18:35.814
that's named after a honeydew.

18:35.883 --> 18:37.849
- Carnegie Mellon?
- Yes, that's it!

18:45.425 --> 18:46.858
She's gonna do great in college.

18:55.936 --> 18:57.636
<i>It's nice to see Taylor
pursuing her passion</i>

18:57.738 --> 19:00.372
<i>and Greg sharing his passion
with the kids.</i>

19:00.474 --> 19:02.474
<i>I'm passionate about two things...</i>

19:02.576 --> 19:05.810
<i>my family and hating these
busybody Westport idiots.</i>

19:05.913 --> 19:08.313
<i>But there's gotta be room
for something else.</i>

19:08.407 --> 19:09.840
- <i>And...</i>
- Mom.

19:09.950 --> 19:11.650
Why are you always nodding your head,

19:11.752 --> 19:13.710
smiling, and staring at us?

19:13.764 --> 19:15.740
- Yeah.
- It creeps us out.

19:18.734 --> 19:19.952
Oh, my.

19:21.337 --> 19:23.458
Why do you have that look on your face?

19:23.513 --> 19:24.747
You know what? I don't care.

19:24.818 --> 19:26.051
When you're done,

19:26.106 --> 19:28.427
- just clear the browser history.
- What? No.

19:28.522 --> 19:30.552
I was looking at the honeydew
school that Taylor wants to go to.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.425
It's a lot more expensive
than community college.

19:33.527 --> 19:35.260
Oh... my.

19:35.329 --> 19:36.595
Right?!

19:36.697 --> 19:38.230
We played this wrong.

19:38.332 --> 19:40.165
Should've just let her run off to L.A.

19:40.267 --> 19:41.333
In light of this,

19:41.402 --> 19:42.668
when you say you might have
quit your job,

19:42.770 --> 19:43.769
can you clarify that?

19:43.871 --> 19:44.870
I didn't quit quit.

19:44.895 --> 19:46.237
I quit in my mind.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.466
Okay. What exactly does that mean?

19:47.568 --> 19:49.018
Like most working Americans,

19:49.086 --> 19:50.819
my spirit has quit

19:50.908 --> 19:53.005
but my body is forced to attend.

19:53.107 --> 19:54.973
No one wants you to follow
your passion more than me,

19:55.075 --> 19:56.408
and I'm just floating this out there...

19:56.510 --> 19:58.677
how about your find a profession
that you're passionate about,

19:58.779 --> 20:00.412
- then quit your job.
- Or...

20:00.514 --> 20:01.847
hear me out...

20:01.949 --> 20:04.883
I quit my job, hang out
in Stewart and Kingston's,

20:04.985 --> 20:07.619
somebody comes in, likes
my no-nonsense attitude,

20:07.721 --> 20:09.454
gives me my own talk show.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.556
Boom! I'm the Queen of Day Time!

20:14.061 --> 20:15.163
Where are you guys off to?

20:15.249 --> 20:17.772
Our first Historical Guild meeting.

20:17.842 --> 20:21.156
- Mm.
- I'm very enthusiastic.

20:21.189 --> 20:22.801
Oliver is less so.

20:22.856 --> 20:24.291
It's Mutton Madness!

20:24.324 --> 20:26.371
Are you sure you don't want to go?

20:26.396 --> 20:28.731
No, I've got <i> a lot</i> of work to do.

20:28.809 --> 20:31.011
But I thought you were quitting...

20:31.090 --> 20:32.225
No, you're right.

20:32.253 --> 20:34.542
I'm gonna keep this job
until I figure out

20:34.574 --> 20:35.674
what I really want to do.

20:35.699 --> 20:38.597
But I know what I really <i>
don't</i> want to do...

20:38.677 --> 20:39.800
go to your thing.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.460
Bring me back some fried chicken.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.273
We're not supposed to call it that!
