at $10 a pop.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.922

- Ogallala-Land Festival.
- Right.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.663
Now, let's just say
you got ten tanks there,

09:55.763 --> 09:57.965
three nights, $10 a pop.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.635
- It's a little over 100 grand.
- That's right.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.538
So, how do I figure
in all this?

10:08.776 --> 10:12.112
Technically,
this is a restaurant, right?

10:12.245 --> 10:13.981
That's debatable,
but yeah, technically,

10:14.114 --> 10:16.016
So you can buy nitrous
in bulk.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.586

a potential employer

that you showed up someplace

reasonably well,

12:08.661 --> 12:09.830
and on time.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.231
So if he hires you,

12:11.364 --> 12:13.000
there's a semi-decent chance

12:13.133 --> 12:14.634
that you'll show up there

13:30.143 --> 13:31.644
I went to New York once
in the '80s.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.580
The heyday.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.416
Parents and I got mugged
by a guy with a samurai sword.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.619
- It's not for everybody.
- Let's have you make a right.

13:48.896 --> 13:52.432
After this light let's have you
pull over and make a K turn.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.766
Okey-doke.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.241
- So, Paul, how am I doing?
- Excellent.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.609
It's obvious that
you're an experienced driver.

14:02.742 --> 14:03.911
- Some of these kids--
- Get down!

14:05.578 --> 14:08.815
Oh, God!
Oh, God, I'm hit! Oh, God!

14:08.949 --> 14:10.150
Stay down!

14:12.285 --> 14:13.386
What are you doing?
Pull over!

14:21.929 --> 14:24.264
Oh, God! Oh!

14:32.139 --> 14:33.640
<i>Wa-ching ♪</i>

14:34.241 --> 14:36.944
<i>♪ That's the sound

14:37.077 --> 14:38.545
You're going to get us killed!

14:45.785 --> 14:47.955

Oh, God!
What are you doing?

15:09.109 --> 15:11.878
I need a hospital!
Get me to a hospital!

15:12.012 --> 15:15.348
- I need a hos--
- Look! Shut the fuck up.

15:21.721 --> 15:25.858
<i>♪ Ah, (ah), ah,

15:29.696 --> 15:31.164
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

15:50.350 --> 15:51.618
I think I'm dying.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.520
You're not dying,

15:53.653 --> 15:55.188
if you were dying
you'd already be dead.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.691
- What are you doing?
- I got a partial plate.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.895
- Come here.
- Stop! You're gonna infect it!

16:04.031 --> 16:06.233
9, F.

16:09.736 --> 16:13.206
Listen,
you didn't see anything Paul.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.808
Nothing. Okay?

16:17.144 --> 16:18.211
Everybody okay?

16:19.179 --> 16:22.182
- You okay?
- Afternoon, officer.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.650
So you're at the light

16:23.783 --> 16:25.318
taking your driver's test,
and then--

16:25.452 --> 16:26.719
Someone comes out of nowhere

16:26.853 --> 16:28.588
and starts shooting at us
from another car.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.458
Unprovoked.
Just, boom, boom, boom?

16:31.591 --> 16:32.925
Like I said
26 times before.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.663
And this other car,
no make, model or color?

16:36.796 --> 16:38.798
It happened so fast.
Do you have a Coke?

16:38.931 --> 16:40.067
In a minute.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.369
You know, we ran your name
through the system.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.437
Then you know I'm a Leo.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.073
You've got a lot of priors,
Mr. Manfredi.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.308
Priors is the key word.
I did my time.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.443
You are no lightweight,
that's for sure.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.313
So, I might be charged
with almost getting shot?

16:53.446 --> 16:54.814
'Cause I don't think
that's a crime,

16:54.947 --> 16:56.316
even in Oklahoma.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.118
Once your statement's complete,
we'll release you.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.452
"Release?"

17:00.153 --> 17:02.789
- I'm being held?
- Not necessarily.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.558
We just want to hear
your version of things.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.594
Like, who it is
might want you dead.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.496
Honestly...

17:10.397 --> 17:11.698
I think whoever did this

17:11.831 --> 17:13.666
had it out
for the driving instructor.

17:14.301 --> 17:17.204
I got a feeling
he failed a lot of people.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.850
Hey.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.252
What are you doing here?

18:05.385 --> 18:07.654
Officer Burke filled me in.
You okay?

18:07.787 --> 18:10.290
I passed my driving test,
there is that.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.824
Congratulations.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.760
Seriously,
what are you doing here?

18:15.162 --> 18:16.429
Came over the radio,
there was a shooting,

18:16.563 --> 18:17.830
they mentioned your name.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.738
You know
you're free to go, right?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.574
What the fuck's going on?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.242
Why is the ATF butting in?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.611
Wonderful spending
time with you.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.046
He's part
of a bigger investigation,

18:34.181 --> 18:37.184
- that's all I can say.
- Can or will?

18:41.621 --> 18:42.855
You know,

18:42.989 --> 18:44.691
you didn't have to
buy me dinner.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.193
Or is this to make up

18:46.193 --> 18:49.095
for the brevity
of our last encounter?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.634
Got a pretty good appetite

18:54.767 --> 18:56.269
for someone
who was just shot at.

18:56.403 --> 18:59.239
If I stopped eating every time
someone tried to hurt me

18:59.372 --> 19:00.640
I'd be a skeleton.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.742
You got any ideas?

19:04.211 --> 19:06.879
Who tried to hurt you?

19:08.948 --> 19:11.351
What are you doing
in Cow Pattie, Oklahoma?

19:12.719 --> 19:15.222
Stopping bad guys
from blowing up our country.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.724
You were involved
with that explosion yesterday,

19:17.857 --> 19:20.560
- the guy with the bombs?
- Mm-hmm.

19:21.027 --> 19:24.731
- Tough day at the office?
- Beats selling insurance.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.001
Seems like both of us
sought out careers

19:29.135 --> 19:31.137
with their share
of tough days.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.340
Why do you think that is?

19:34.241 --> 19:35.475
Because
we're both fucking crazy.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.578
Oh, man.

19:38.711 --> 19:42.349
Finally, someone addresses
the elephant in the room.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.984
So you left New York
to come here?

19:45.818 --> 19:49.155
I popped around a few places before.

19:50.122 --> 19:53.260
I was in customs before 9/11,
got recruited.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.529
- Switched to ATF.
- So you transferred to Tulsa?

19:56.663 --> 19:59.165
No, I was asked to leave.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.401
- Asked?
- Ordered.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.704
So I packed up myself
and my plants

20:04.837 --> 20:06.773
and my now ex-husband Edward and...

20:13.079 --> 20:14.481
I basically lost my shit.

20:15.482 --> 20:16.883
And apparently

20:17.016 --> 20:20.853
Tulsa is one of the ATF's
many versions of Siberia.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.255
Come on now.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.357
9/11?

20:24.491 --> 20:26.025
It's not like everybody
didn't lose their shit

20:26.158 --> 20:29.329
- a little bit.
- It wasn't 9/11, actually.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.530
It was later.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.799
9/11...

20:33.566 --> 20:35.101
I was a rockstar.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.404
Police Meritorious
Service Medal.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.872
Police Distinguished
Service Medal.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.174
They loved me.

20:43.976 --> 20:47.046
- And then Sully happened.
- Sully?

20:47.179 --> 20:49.849
The guy who landed the plane
in the Hudson River?

20:49.982 --> 20:53.052
I was doing a 4 to 12.
Headed into work.

20:53.653 --> 20:56.523
I was on 12th Ave
and I saw this plane...

20:57.290 --> 20:59.392
it was flying solo
and I thought...

21:01.328 --> 21:03.663
"What else could it be?
Here we go again."

21:04.697 --> 21:07.367
- I freaked out.
- It's understandable.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.235
Not in my line of work.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.971
What happens in your work...

21:13.072 --> 21:16.343
If someone loses their shit
and puts their...

21:17.143 --> 21:18.845
associate,

21:18.978 --> 21:20.580
someone who counts on them
at risk?

21:21.414 --> 21:23.450
Probably
wouldn't turn out so well.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.489
Do you remember the last time
we were together?

21:29.622 --> 21:30.690
You said...

21:31.524 --> 21:34.361
you couldn't help me
if I got jammed up.

21:35.495 --> 21:39.098
What can I say?
I guess I'm shitty at my job.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.441
This cannot
and will not...

21:49.542 --> 21:51.644
- happen again, okay?
- Okay.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.948
Stop smiling. No.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.183
You need some help
with this shoe?

21:57.384 --> 21:58.718
No, I've got it.
Thank you.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.119
I helped you get it off.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.188
Thank you for dinner.

22:02.755 --> 22:03.823
Stacy.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.059
Let me know if you find out
who tried to shoot me.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.767
<i>What do I owe the pleasure?</i>

22:14.901 --> 22:17.003
I think the pleasure
might be one sided.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.405
<i>What do you mean?</i>

22:18.405 --> 22:20.407
Somebody tried to kill me yesterday.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.874
<i>Whoa, what?</i>

22:22.008 --> 22:23.610
Get the fuck out.
What happened?

22:23.743 --> 22:25.011
<i>Stopped at a light.</i>

22:25.545 --> 22:28.247
<i>- Guy started shooting.</i>
- Who was it?

22:29.215 --> 22:31.283
I was hoping
you could tell me.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.819
How the fuck should I know?

22:32.952 --> 22:34.487
I'm going to ask you this
one time

22:34.621 --> 22:36.288
and you be straight with me.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.525
Is this Vince's hand?

22:38.658 --> 22:42.261
Hey, I mediated a fair outcome
with all parties.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.196
The issue is dead.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.065
<i>So you're telling me
there's no chance</i>

22:46.198 --> 22:47.434
<i>of this punk going rogue</i>

22:47.534 --> 22:49.301
on account
of me breaking his jaw

22:49.436 --> 22:50.770
<i>because of his big fucking mouth?</i>

22:52.004 --> 22:53.440
What's he fucking saying?

22:55.442 --> 22:56.609
You know,
you got some fucking balls,

22:56.743 --> 22:58.445
- you know that?
<i>- Do I?</i>

22:58.445 --> 23:00.647
Let someone try to take you out
at a stoplight

23:00.780 --> 23:02.449
and we'll hear
your list of suspects.

23:02.549 --> 23:03.650
<i>What are you referring?</i>

23:03.783 --> 23:04.951
That I'm weak?

23:05.452 --> 23:07.687
That I can't control
my own fucking crew?

23:07.820 --> 23:10.457
I told Vince it's over.
It's fucking over.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.291
Fuck your bruised ego, Chickie,

23:12.459 --> 23:14.627
I got shot at
by some ball-less sack of shit

23:14.761 --> 23:16.328
- in a ski mask.
<i>- Okay.</i>

23:16.463 --> 23:18.465
I get it, all right?

23:19.466 --> 23:21.033
And I gave you my answer.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.502
<i>But by the way,</i>

23:22.635 --> 23:25.237
your lifelong friendship
with my father aside

23:25.371 --> 23:27.674
just as a pure fucking business decision,

23:27.807 --> 23:30.176
I got to be out of my mind
to take you out.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.811
<i>You're a great earner.</i>

23:32.344 --> 23:33.780
Of course.
What was I thinking?

23:33.913 --> 23:35.114
Now let me ask you,

23:35.247 --> 23:36.716
you make any enemies
out there

23:36.849 --> 23:38.851
<i>fucking some cowboys wife
or something?</i>

23:38.985 --> 23:40.086
Don't insult me.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.621
Well, you figure it out.
Okay?

23:41.754 --> 23:44.156
You let me know.
But you all right, though?

23:44.290 --> 23:45.558
I mean, otherwise.

23:46.392 --> 23:47.694
Yeah, I'm blessed.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.395
You with the nine
fucking lives.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.798
<i>I'm glad somebody is counting.</i>

23:52.899 --> 23:54.867
Give your father
a kiss for me.

23:55.635 --> 23:56.703
Yeah.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.748
Stop.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.050
That's Caolan Waltrip.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.384
He's the head
of Black Macadam,

24:12.519 --> 24:13.886
a one percenter
motorcycle gang.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.355
He showed up during
the standoff at the house

24:16.523 --> 24:17.624
the other day.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.526
For some reason,
he and his crew

24:19.526 --> 24:21.360
are suddenly arming themselves
to the teeth.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.195
Assault with a deadly weapon,
attempted murder,

24:23.329 --> 24:25.632
attempted larceny,
attempted murder.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.568
He did six years in Attica.
Major armed robberies.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.103
Got released and picked up
where he left off.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.274
Ooh, that is Edgar Dumont.
Former cell made of Waltrip's.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.744
He's the lunatic
who blew himself up.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.614
Robbie Trucotte
and Carson Pike.

24:41.748 --> 24:44.383
Yeah, nobody gets
within 20 feet of Waltrip

24:44.551 --> 24:46.619
without going through
Pike first.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.056
Who's this wacko?

24:50.189 --> 24:52.825
That
is Rochelle "Roxy" Harrington.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.894
She's actually
a munitions expert.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.029
Did three tours in Afghanistan.
She's got Waltrip's ear.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.598
Kinda thin file

24:58.731 --> 25:00.232
for someone moving that far up
the food chain,

25:00.366 --> 25:02.368
She probably hit
the glass ceiling.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.605
With Dumont out of the picture

25:05.738 --> 25:07.840
I think we focus
on these three guys.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.811
<i>Jennifer?</i>

25:11.944 --> 25:13.479
<i>How about your roof?</i>

25:13.613 --> 25:14.847
<i>Your roof?
Good answer!</i>

25:14.981 --> 25:17.584
- Hello, Paul.
- Mr. Manfredi.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.920
- This is unexpected.
- Hey, it's the least I can do.

25:25.257 --> 25:26.893
Look at all these goodies.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.866
- Okay if I use this?
- I guess.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.138
Thank you.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.373
Not necessary,
but very much appreciated.

25:41.507 --> 25:42.909
Don't mention it.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.458
So, the police,
do they know who did it?

25:59.626 --> 26:01.193
They're coming up short.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.395
They're understaffed.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.098
I was thinking
maybe you could help out.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.135
- Me?
- You, Paul. You.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.503
Oh.

26:12.639 --> 26:15.107
Got something for you.
Get well card.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.644
Open it.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.649
- What is this?
- Looks like ten grand to me.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.651
-$10,000?
- Shh!

26:25.918 --> 26:27.286
This is the least I can do

26:27.419 --> 26:29.689
to compensate for your pain
and suffering.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.358
I don't know,
this seems wrong.

26:32.491 --> 26:33.860
It only seems wrong

26:33.993 --> 26:35.895
because you feel like
you didn't earn it,

26:36.028 --> 26:37.529
so here
is what we're going to do.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.099
It was a blue
Chevy Caprice.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.802
These are the first four
numbers on the plate.

26:43.535 --> 26:46.572
I want you to call your buddies
down at the DMV

26:46.706 --> 26:48.107
and see
what they come up with.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.076
Shouldn't the police--

26:51.878 --> 26:53.212
I'm proud of you, Paul.

26:59.018 --> 27:01.220
<i>Name something
that you'd save a fortune on</i>

27:01.353 --> 27:03.255
<i>- if you knew how to fix it.</i>
- It's a rerun.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.957
<i>- How about "television?"
- Your television.</i>

27:05.091 --> 27:06.726
<i>Good answer!</i>

27:06.859 --> 27:09.461
<i>- Two answers remain.</i>
- Feel better.

27:09.595 --> 27:11.798
<i>Show me TV!</i>

27:40.760 --> 27:42.729
What's that, chocolate chip?

27:47.566 --> 27:50.002
- What's this?
- Your severance.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.373
You see the bullet holes
in that car?

27:54.506 --> 27:55.742
The missing windows

27:55.842 --> 27:57.143
where your head
could have been?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.111
Yeah, I seen it.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.848
I'm not here
to get you killed.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.050
It's bad enough
that thing was parked

28:04.183 --> 28:05.451
in front of your house
all night.

28:05.584 --> 28:07.553
God forbid your mother,
your sister,

28:07.754 --> 28:09.121
somebody walks by

28:09.255 --> 28:10.923
- and gets mistaken for me.
- Look, I hear you, okay?

28:11.057 --> 28:13.359
I'm just saying that
I'm willing to pay my dues.

28:13.492 --> 28:14.861
What dues?

28:14.994 --> 28:16.528
Look, I know you think
I'm some punk ass bitch,

28:16.662 --> 28:18.464
but I'm not,
I'm willing to put the work in,

28:18.597 --> 28:20.399
- just give me a chance.
- Listen, kid.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.502
I'm not a kid.
I'm 25 years old. I get it.

28:33.579 --> 28:35.815
This is your choice.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.418
Fine.

28:43.655 --> 28:44.857
Now, what do you need?

28:44.991 --> 28:47.794
First of all,
I want a new car.

28:47.794 --> 28:50.129
So go see that guy
at the dealership.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.363
Done.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.399
And not a Navigator,
and not black.

28:53.532 --> 28:56.168
- Oh, I get it.
- And I want it for free.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.939
- For free? What you mean?
- That one's a lemon.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.408
It's got bullet holes
all over it.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.634
<i>Mr. Manfredi,
this is Paul Cheevers</i>

30:35.767 --> 30:36.768
<i>from the Tulsa DMV.</i>

30:36.903 --> 30:38.570
<i>The, um,</i>

30:38.704 --> 30:41.673
<i>object you're looking for
was dumped and tagged</i>

30:41.807 --> 30:43.075
<i>by Tulsa Sanitation</i>

30:43.209 --> 30:44.776
<i>at an abandoned lot</i>

30:44.911 --> 30:47.179
<i>near Oak and Orlando.</i>

30:47.313 --> 30:50.182
<i>No need to call back. Ever.</i>

31:00.026 --> 31:02.528
Okay,
OG got on them Isotoners.

31:02.661 --> 31:03.729
I see you.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.267
Fire needs oxygen to burn.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.469
This idiot
kept the windows closed.

31:17.076 --> 31:20.246
- DMSO?
- DMSO.

31:23.950 --> 31:26.618
It's a liniment
used to reduce inflammation

31:26.752 --> 31:28.420
in horses.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.189
It's highly flammable.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.726
What's that?
Look like "FR" to you?

31:34.860 --> 31:35.962
That's FR.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.564
Type in "FR" and "horses."

31:42.701 --> 31:44.436
Place about five miles
from here.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.805
Fennario Ranch.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.744
So you want to go?

31:55.381 --> 31:56.415
I'm gonna do this alone.

32:33.052 --> 32:36.022
- Your boss around?
- Check the stables out back.

33:05.351 --> 33:06.685
Excuse me.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.058
Mrs. Fennario?

33:13.059 --> 33:14.060
Miss Devereaux.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.095
Fennario is just the name
of the ranch.

33:17.063 --> 33:19.431
See, that's me thinking
you're a <i>paisan.</i>

33:19.565 --> 33:21.133
Well, I like Italian food.
Does that count?

33:21.267 --> 33:22.734
Of course it does.

33:22.868 --> 33:24.636
- How can I help you, Mister--
- Marconi.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.305
I'm a private investigator.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.175
A client's car
was stolen and set on fire,

33:29.308 --> 33:31.110
and I found this
in the back seat.

33:32.978 --> 33:35.247
Ah, these things
are a waste of money.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.949
Get stolen
as soon as I buy them.

33:38.084 --> 33:41.753
- Also found a can of DMSO.
- Okay, so?

33:41.887 --> 33:43.922
Do you think anybody
working here

33:44.090 --> 33:46.158
is capable of doing
something like that?

33:46.292 --> 33:49.628
- Burning a car?
- You know,
or shooting somebody.

33:52.731 --> 33:55.901
Like, I don't know who you are
or what you want.

33:56.102 --> 33:59.371
- I'm a private investigator.
- Right. And I'm an astronaut.

34:00.239 --> 34:01.740
I employ 171 people.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.510
I can vouch for the work ethic
while they're here,

34:04.643 --> 34:06.512
but once they're through
those gates--

34:06.645 --> 34:08.414
Well, do you mind
if I ask around?

34:08.547 --> 34:09.915
On my property?

34:10.449 --> 34:12.984
- Yeah, I do mind.
- Fair enough.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.588
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.125
Do you give riding lessons?

34:22.994 --> 34:25.197
Call the number
on the website.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.205
I like this state.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.411
You think
you so badass, huh?

34:39.545 --> 34:41.647
Run up on my boy?

34:42.414 --> 34:43.715
Run up on my boy?

34:44.650 --> 34:46.017
Take potshots?

34:46.985 --> 34:48.987
Sneak up and ambush
some motherfucker?

34:49.588 --> 34:51.056
Huh?

34:51.190 --> 34:52.858
Oh, that's a bad move,

34:53.892 --> 34:56.795
'Cause you, uh,
you know me and him...

34:58.397 --> 34:59.665
we tight

35:04.370 --> 35:05.637
We tight.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.073
You make a move on him,

35:08.207 --> 35:10.008
you best make a move on me, too.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.314
You make a move on him...

35:17.082 --> 35:18.984
You best make a move on me, too.

35:22.654 --> 35:25.257
Coming in guns blazing.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.695
I will kill you.

35:57.423 --> 35:59.858
- How are you doing?
- I got a dog.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.795
He's a stray.
He's a little old and beat up.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.764
Well, somebody's got a type.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.299
You around later?

36:07.966 --> 36:09.468
<i>Sorry. Plans.</i>

36:10.602 --> 36:12.137
Oh, that's okay.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.740
What are you naming the dog?

36:15.374 --> 36:18.577
I was thinking about
naming him Chance.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.347
As in second or last?

36:23.482 --> 36:26.485
TBD.
I haven't gotten that far yet.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.723
I gotta go. Keep me posted.

37:25.477 --> 37:29.114
Hey my man! My little man!
How are you?

37:29.315 --> 37:31.082
- How's my best boy?
- Come on, Dad!

37:31.216 --> 37:33.151
- How's my best boy?
- I'm so great!

37:33.319 --> 37:35.020
How was school today?

37:54.940 --> 37:56.942
I went away
for a third of my life

37:57.075 --> 37:59.345
and you try to shoot me?

38:00.078 --> 38:01.780
My wife is going to
be home any minute now.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.715
I'll leave a note.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.951
Go out there
and make some money.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.052
You guys want a balloon?

38:07.185 --> 38:08.654
This is our territory.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.723
This nitro is our existence.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.360
You ever read "The Art of War?"

38:14.360 --> 38:16.528
- Really?
- I got a plan.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.030
You need all
the friends you can get.

38:19.731 --> 38:21.633
Let's go, my children.
