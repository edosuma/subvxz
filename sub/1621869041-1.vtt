WEBVTT

00:22.919 --> 00:24.248
- What are you doing?

00:24.248 --> 00:26.167
I want a picture.

00:26.167 --> 00:27.247
- What?

00:27.247 --> 00:29.826
I just want a picture.

00:29.826 --> 00:32.051
I want a picture with you

00:32.051 --> 00:33.301
in this moment.

01:00.866 --> 01:02.710
like a dark shade of orange

01:05.912 --> 01:07.670
like my city had a mouth

01:09.276 --> 01:11.072
when I get it Imma burn it

01:11.072 --> 01:13.082
right now even deserve it

01:15.312 --> 01:16.790
a penny turn to gold

01:18.960 --> 01:20.601
and the money and the fame

01:20.601 --> 01:21.512
fruit if you choose

01:22.550 --> 01:24.700
gold and a house up on a lake

01:26.072 --> 01:29.107
and lamb in the garage

01:42.560 --> 01:44.049
they really wanna get involved

01:44.049 --> 01:45.768
off in the elevator

01:47.810 --> 01:49.653
I have a nice time with it

01:49.653 --> 01:52.006
way to the right side of him

01:58.665 --> 02:00.455
sit up on my ottoman

02:00.455 --> 02:02.257
otter with no time to kill

02:02.257 --> 02:04.199
opposite of worthless

02:04.199 --> 02:06.589
a purposeful thing to me

02:06.589 --> 02:07.988
and it works for me

02:07.988 --> 02:09.929
and putting money into pushing

02:09.929 --> 02:12.006
and I'm getting overlooked

02:13.857 --> 02:15.608
everything that I deserve

02:42.744 --> 02:45.744
- Hey man, that'll be like 10 bucks.

02:48.624 --> 02:51.957
It's not even what I ordered.

02:51.957 --> 02:55.374
- Just take the fucking shit and go, guy.

02:57.917 --> 02:59.386
- Asshole.

03:14.201 --> 03:16.053
- Did you cum in front of that guy?

03:16.053 --> 03:18.172
- I told you if you do that
thing with your tongue,

03:18.172 --> 03:19.926
I'll nut every time.

03:19.926 --> 03:21.975
- You're the worst.

03:21.975 --> 03:23.826
How do you even still have this job?

03:23.826 --> 03:24.659
- Oh, come on.

03:24.659 --> 03:26.816
Nobody else in this fucking
town wants this job.

03:26.816 --> 03:29.478
I don't even want this fucking job.

03:29.478 --> 03:32.395
They need me more than I need them.

03:33.785 --> 03:37.702
So you wanna go to the
back and I'll, you know.

03:47.901 --> 03:51.621
- Oh, hey, I was this
town's second gay man.

03:51.621 --> 03:52.454
All right?

03:52.454 --> 03:53.309
It was 1997--

03:53.309 --> 03:55.560
- '97, and I was 12 years old,

03:55.560 --> 03:56.699
and a couple eighth graders caught me

03:56.699 --> 03:58.181
in the boys' bathroom at school,

03:58.181 --> 04:01.160
jacking off to a Jonathan
Taylor Thomas photo.

04:01.160 --> 04:04.730
Everyone found out now I'm
this town's Freddie Mercury.

04:04.730 --> 04:06.410
- Hey fuck nut, I tell
it better than that.

04:06.410 --> 04:07.610
- Maybe.

04:07.610 --> 04:09.560
I don't need to hear it again.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.000
So fucking what?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.330
There had to be hundreds of gay men

04:12.330 --> 04:13.549
in this town before you,

04:13.549 --> 04:15.654
and they'll be hundreds after.

04:15.654 --> 04:17.309
You aren't fucking special.

04:17.309 --> 04:18.189
And by your own admission,

04:18.189 --> 04:20.600
you weren't even the
first to come out, so.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.600
- Yeah, but,

04:22.880 --> 04:25.855
right, I guess there's that dirty ass pedo

04:25.855 --> 04:26.688
over on Marshall Street.

04:26.688 --> 04:27.666
- Last house on the left.

04:27.666 --> 04:29.124
- Yeah, right.

04:29.124 --> 04:30.458
But he hardly fucking counts.

04:30.458 --> 04:34.328
I mean, everybody knows
he's liked boys since 1973,

04:34.328 --> 04:36.488
that doesn't count.

04:43.957 --> 04:45.048
God damn.

04:45.048 --> 04:46.597
Best feeling in the world
must be taking a piss

04:46.597 --> 04:48.549
after cumming.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.127
- You're a fucking jerk, Mitch.

04:50.127 --> 04:50.960
- Hey, watch it, Jenny.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.710
I'm trynna piss here.

04:54.152 --> 04:55.152
- Yo, Harry.

05:00.408 --> 05:02.848
- This town sucks so hard.

05:02.848 --> 05:03.865
- I don't know.

05:03.865 --> 05:04.968
Could be worse.

05:04.968 --> 05:06.457
- A lot worse.

05:06.457 --> 05:08.137
- Oh, you mean like Soviet Russia?

05:08.137 --> 05:09.977
- Oh, fuck you.

05:11.826 --> 05:13.385
- I'm not from here either.

05:13.385 --> 05:15.877
- Well, yeah, but you're cute.

05:15.877 --> 05:17.768
So what's
your real name, Mike?

05:17.768 --> 05:20.672
- What kind of stupid question is that?

05:20.672 --> 05:21.654
- I just wanna know.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.346
Is that bad to ask?

05:23.346 --> 05:24.929
- No, it's Nikolai.

05:27.888 --> 05:30.037
- See, you might learn something, asshole.

05:30.037 --> 05:31.594
- Whatever, Krissy.

05:31.594 --> 05:33.368
You know I hate that.

05:33.368 --> 05:35.368
Okay, Kristen.

05:38.376 --> 05:40.511
- See those fucking yahoos out there?

05:40.511 --> 05:44.355
Those PC, no opinion,
sheepo fucks are who I have

05:44.355 --> 05:45.845
to deal with every God damn day,

05:45.845 --> 05:49.344
so believe me, it's not all
fun times at Ridgemont High.

05:49.344 --> 05:54.199
- Ah, it's Fast Times at
Ridgemont High, fuck nut.

05:54.199 --> 05:55.032
When you get talking like that,

05:55.032 --> 05:59.256
you sound like a cynical,
wrinkly old queen.

05:59.256 --> 06:00.165
Do you know what?

06:00.165 --> 06:01.224
From now on,

06:01.224 --> 06:05.307
I will consider myself
this town's first gay man.

06:07.046 --> 06:07.936
So fuck that.

06:07.936 --> 06:10.571
The dirty pedo doesn't count.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.466
- He counts, baby.

06:12.466 --> 06:14.133
I'll call you later.

06:23.017 --> 06:26.584
Ah, Jenner, you can
smell Ricky's cum from here.

06:26.584 --> 06:28.237
- Fuck you, Mitch.

06:28.237 --> 06:30.117
That's not my name.

06:30.117 --> 06:30.950
Hey.

06:35.637 --> 06:38.247
You're sucking that dart like a faggot.

06:38.247 --> 06:40.838
- Don't use that word.

06:40.838 --> 06:41.671
- What?

06:42.709 --> 06:45.778
Don't give me that
politically correct bullshit.

06:45.778 --> 06:47.578
I can say what I want.

06:47.578 --> 06:48.869
You know, I can't keep it straight

06:48.869 --> 06:53.869
with what F word or G word or
M word is offensive this week.

06:55.535 --> 06:58.107
You know, not everyone is nice.

06:58.107 --> 07:01.165
Not everyone can accept
everyone as they are,

07:01.165 --> 07:03.181
and actually thinking that's
possible is fucking insane,

07:03.181 --> 07:04.598
so you know what?

07:06.183 --> 07:08.663
I'll fucking say anything I want,

07:08.663 --> 07:11.924
you cracker dike, fucking
carpet munching piece

07:11.924 --> 07:14.069
of fucking retarded nigger-loving,

07:14.069 --> 07:15.485
vertical stink wallet,

07:15.485 --> 07:17.827
piece of fucking retarded diarrhea,

07:17.827 --> 07:20.717
shit licking Jew, faggot, cunt.

07:26.147 --> 07:26.980
- Dude.

07:34.066 --> 07:36.626
Travis is
having a fucking party.

07:36.626 --> 07:38.879
Travis Turner?

07:38.879 --> 07:41.564
What the hell are you doing
with that lunatic's number?

07:41.564 --> 07:44.638
- He takes good calculus notes.

07:44.638 --> 07:48.388
He says, "No parents
and free beer" and shit.

07:49.412 --> 07:50.245
- I couldn't care less

07:50.245 --> 07:52.292
if fucking Charles Manson threw a party.

07:52.292 --> 07:54.243
Free beer, I'm there.

07:54.243 --> 07:55.910
- Ooga, ooga, Putin.

07:57.332 --> 08:00.272
Booga, wooga, MSG and shit.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.112
Come on, take a bite.

08:02.112 --> 08:02.945
Take a bite of it--

08:02.945 --> 08:04.382
- Hey, I'm allergic to nuts.

08:05.592 --> 08:07.558
I fucking knew it.

08:07.558 --> 08:08.583
I'm more dangerous

08:08.583 --> 08:11.122
than a fucking pissed off
Trump supporter with a gun.

08:11.122 --> 08:12.642
I'll fucking kill a bitch.

08:17.009 --> 08:18.176
Peace, losers.

08:19.850 --> 08:22.183
- He's fucking mentally ill.

08:23.082 --> 08:25.041
- So we're gonna go to that thing or what?

08:25.041 --> 08:26.610
- Look, Travis is a shit nugget,

08:26.610 --> 08:28.241
Columbine shooter waiting to happen,

08:28.241 --> 08:32.526
but yeah, what the fuck else
is there to do around here?

08:32.526 --> 08:34.776
- Tonight feels weird, man.

08:35.632 --> 08:38.701
- You know, they are not
coming tonight, right dude?

08:43.383 --> 08:44.390
Hey.

08:44.390 --> 08:47.021
- Travis, what the fuck, man.

08:47.021 --> 08:48.170
I had to find out about your party

08:48.170 --> 08:50.461
from fucking Mitch and those chachas.

08:50.461 --> 08:52.190
Yeah, sorry, man.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.862
I was gonna message you.

08:53.862 --> 08:55.019
Had a lot to do.

08:55.019 --> 08:57.019
Getting ready and shit.

08:57.019 --> 08:58.507
- How the fuck is this possible?

08:58.507 --> 09:00.680
How do you even have a phone right now?

09:00.680 --> 09:03.221
My parents left
for Florida for the weekend.

09:03.221 --> 09:04.650
I stole my phone back.

09:04.650 --> 09:08.139
- Jesus, dude, so you decide
to throw a fucking rager?

09:08.139 --> 09:09.355
Yeah.

09:09.355 --> 09:11.036
- You know by telling
Harry, Kristen, Mitch,

09:11.036 --> 09:13.158
and those fuck there's
gonna be like 30 people

09:13.158 --> 09:14.326
at your house.

09:14.326 --> 09:15.159
You think?

09:15.159 --> 09:16.278
- I'm coming over now.

09:16.278 --> 09:18.678
Sweet man, I'll see you soon.

09:24.267 --> 09:26.267
- You went all out, huh?

09:27.906 --> 09:28.966
- Yeah, man.

09:28.966 --> 09:32.487
Gonna be hectic like one
of those teen party movies.

09:32.487 --> 09:33.320
I've even got stacks

09:33.320 --> 09:35.413
of those red fucking cups you always see.

09:35.413 --> 09:36.246
- Mhm.

09:45.311 --> 09:48.006
You think this is the right thing to do?

09:48.006 --> 09:50.589
- This is the only thing to do.

09:53.050 --> 09:53.970
- Okay.

09:58.346 --> 10:00.318
I got my mind on loot

10:01.848 --> 10:03.718
woke up in a Bugatti,

10:10.138 --> 10:11.760
ready 'bout that action

10:14.720 --> 10:16.520
I am living proof

10:27.317 --> 10:29.914
they see how many days

10:33.136 --> 10:36.795
told me just to go for it

11:00.976 --> 11:03.980
'cause I got a better sale

11:03.980 --> 11:05.468
- You're with Mitch, right?

11:08.792 --> 11:10.858
New girl this year.

11:10.858 --> 11:12.900
How's that been?

11:12.900 --> 11:14.770
- Used to moving.

11:14.770 --> 11:18.853
This town blows, but has
some interesting people.

11:20.842 --> 11:23.671
- You're right about that.

11:23.671 --> 11:25.172
- Not to be offensive,

11:25.172 --> 11:26.172
but why him?

11:27.561 --> 11:29.161
I mean like he's smart.

11:29.161 --> 11:32.612
He gives me notes in class and shit.

11:32.612 --> 11:34.900
- We were 10 years old,

11:34.900 --> 11:38.225
playing a basketball
game in another school.

11:38.225 --> 11:40.972
Travis and I were on the bench, of course,

11:40.972 --> 11:42.840
'cause we sucked,

11:42.840 --> 11:46.257
but for some reason, the coach put me in.

11:47.481 --> 11:50.814
I got the ball and tried to make a pass.

11:54.216 --> 11:56.248
It went like a foot.

11:56.248 --> 11:57.528
The other team picked it up and scored,

11:57.528 --> 12:01.368
and coach took me off,
and then one of the kids

12:01.368 --> 12:03.608
from the other team yelled over at me,

12:03.608 --> 12:05.775
"You throw like a faggot."

12:07.896 --> 12:10.188
After the game was over,

12:10.188 --> 12:11.387
we were walking out of the school,

12:11.387 --> 12:12.903
and Travis sees the kid who yelled at me,

12:12.903 --> 12:16.913
and he ran over to him and
punched him in the face.

12:16.913 --> 12:18.163
Broke his nose.

12:19.242 --> 12:22.893
He was suspended for like five days.

12:22.893 --> 12:26.143
From that day on, we were best friends.

12:27.722 --> 12:32.061
me, they say, "Oh Lord"

12:39.711 --> 12:43.311
God you dodge a tomb

12:45.975 --> 12:49.142
- Aren't you excited to join the club?

12:50.714 --> 12:55.047
- I'm excited to just feel
comfortable with my body.

12:59.689 --> 13:01.447
What about you, huh?

13:01.447 --> 13:02.938
What?

13:02.938 --> 13:06.631
- You're different than those bitches.

13:06.631 --> 13:10.964
- I tried that shit for
awhile, the feminist circle.

13:11.970 --> 13:15.291
I went to the meetings,
read all their shit,

13:15.291 --> 13:16.741
joined all the Facebook groups,

13:16.741 --> 13:20.031
you know, like the typical shit.

13:20.031 --> 13:22.448
Something just, I don't know,

13:23.330 --> 13:25.701
felt so fake about the whole thing.

13:25.701 --> 13:27.351
- What do you mean?

13:27.351 --> 13:28.791
- I'm not even in college,

13:28.791 --> 13:30.471
and I've read and watched all the things

13:30.471 --> 13:32.002
that you need to,

13:32.002 --> 13:32.835
and these chicks

13:32.835 --> 13:35.541
at these meetings would just
regurgitate the same shit

13:35.541 --> 13:39.591
over and over, and the new
girls would just eat it up.

13:39.591 --> 13:42.322
I mean, I don't need some
20-year-old fucking hippie

13:42.322 --> 13:43.653
to explain Virginia Woolf

13:43.653 --> 13:46.320
and the Vagina Monologues to me.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.434
What was hard to understand
is what are we doing

13:50.434 --> 13:54.783
in this third wave or
whatever wave we're in?

13:54.783 --> 13:58.033
I don't think it can
be any more ambiguous.

13:58.033 --> 14:01.133
Nobody knows what the fuck we're doing.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.954
The biggest reason why I
left is because we were

14:02.954 --> 14:05.537
at a meeting in circle sharing,

14:06.403 --> 14:08.605
and I decided to join in.

14:08.605 --> 14:09.438
- Oh, boy.

14:10.543 --> 14:15.543
- Yeah, I said out loud that
my dream was to finish college,

14:15.663 --> 14:19.125
and to become a wife, and a
stay-at-home mom to three kids.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.005
- Didn't go over well, did it?

14:21.005 --> 14:24.365
- I couldn't understand
why if I'm a free woman,

14:24.365 --> 14:28.004
why can't I choose to
be mom and to be a wife?

14:28.004 --> 14:30.725
Like just like, it's a choice to be a CEO

14:30.725 --> 14:32.563
of some big company,

14:32.563 --> 14:35.313
it's my choice to be a homemaker.

14:36.245 --> 14:40.863
Somehow they not only
couldn't respect me for it,

14:40.863 --> 14:45.175
they couldn't see how
hypocritical they were being.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.758
So I said, "Fuck that, I'm out.

14:49.125 --> 14:53.154
"I'll have to figure
this shit out on my own."

14:53.154 --> 14:55.933
- Wow, we need to hang out more.

14:55.933 --> 14:59.293
- Yeah, we don't exactly
run in the same circle.

14:59.293 --> 15:01.341
I mean, not that there's circles

15:01.341 --> 15:03.274
at this fucking school, but still.

15:03.274 --> 15:06.253
- I know, just being who I am at my age,

15:06.253 --> 15:08.893
not a lot of kids can handle that,

15:08.893 --> 15:11.133
especially around here.

15:11.133 --> 15:12.941
- Nah, I get it.

15:22.573 --> 15:26.333
- So why the fuck are you with that dude?

15:26.333 --> 15:27.250
- Big dick.

15:28.954 --> 15:31.502
Plus, he can make me cum.

15:31.502 --> 15:34.542
As a high school boy, I think
that's pretty fucking sweet.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.314
- Fucking A, dude.

15:44.458 --> 15:47.111
- I like need another drink.

15:47.111 --> 15:48.442
- You what?

15:48.442 --> 15:50.202
- I said, "I like need another drink."

15:50.202 --> 15:51.531
- You would like something
similar to a drink,

15:51.531 --> 15:54.903
or you like, need another drink?

15:54.903 --> 15:57.143
- What?
- You heard what I say.

15:57.143 --> 15:58.093
- Yeah, but I don't get it.

15:58.093 --> 15:59.543
You just said the same thing.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.013
- Sorta, it's just confusing
because of the like.

16:02.013 --> 16:04.343
Like where you put the
like in the emphasis

16:04.343 --> 16:06.286
on like can change what
you're trying to say.

16:06.286 --> 16:08.042
Like if you said it was raining

16:08.042 --> 16:13.042
like cats and dogs or it's
raining like cats and dogs.

16:15.431 --> 16:16.842
See the difference?

16:16.842 --> 16:17.962
It's the same sentence,

16:17.962 --> 16:19.173
but if I were to take
your meaning of like,

16:19.173 --> 16:21.922
I could actually think it
was raining domestic pets.

16:21.922 --> 16:22.834
- So what?

16:22.834 --> 16:25.762
- I'm just saying like
use like, like properly.

16:25.762 --> 16:27.794
- Like why do you care?

16:27.794 --> 16:29.302
- I don't understand
why we need to use like

16:29.302 --> 16:30.342
in every sentence.

16:30.342 --> 16:32.623
Basically every other word,
and put it on the listener

16:32.623 --> 16:33.583
to figure out what the person

16:33.583 --> 16:36.074
who's doing the liking is trying to say.

16:36.074 --> 16:37.282
- You're an asshole.

16:37.282 --> 16:39.468
- Makes our generation look stupid.

16:39.468 --> 16:42.962
- Okay, you're basing our
entire generation's intelligence

16:42.962 --> 16:45.673
on using one word too much in a sentence.

16:45.673 --> 16:46.674
- Yeah.

16:46.674 --> 16:49.493
- Okay, you're an even bigger
asshole than I thought.

16:49.493 --> 16:51.641
- An asshole, sometimes.

17:11.030 --> 17:15.801
touched for the first time

18:15.321 --> 18:17.580
- Weirdest one is gonna
be John Lennon killed

18:17.580 --> 18:19.309
by Stephen King.

18:19.309 --> 18:20.289
Here we go.

18:20.289 --> 18:21.122
What?

18:21.122 --> 18:22.140
- Stephen who?

18:22.140 --> 18:26.625
- Oh, come on, you know,
crazy clowns, big spiders.

18:26.625 --> 18:27.458
- Carrie.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.197
- Yeah, that movie with
the kick ass chick.

18:29.197 --> 18:30.379
- Okay, she's hot.

18:30.379 --> 18:31.212
- Is she?

18:31.212 --> 18:32.045
- I mean like kinda.

18:33.037 --> 18:34.699
- Okay, okay, what is like
everyone favorite movie

18:34.699 --> 18:35.597
of all time?

18:35.597 --> 18:38.930
- Oh, probably something like Star Wars,

18:40.094 --> 18:42.606
or like Shawshank Redemption
or something like that.

18:42.606 --> 18:47.606
- Exactly, Shawshank based
on a story by Stephen King.

18:47.685 --> 18:51.536
- Oh, so he's like a
Nicholas Sparks type thing.

18:51.536 --> 18:53.453
- Yeah, just like that.

18:57.158 --> 18:57.991
- Come on, man.

18:57.991 --> 18:59.204
What the shit is this?

18:59.204 --> 19:00.404
I wanna get back to the party.

19:00.404 --> 19:01.487
- Hey, man.

19:01.487 --> 19:03.097
What the fuck is going on?

19:03.097 --> 19:05.408
- What do you mean?

19:05.408 --> 19:07.178
- You don't know these people.

19:07.178 --> 19:08.342
- So?

19:08.342 --> 19:09.542
We're having a good time.

19:09.542 --> 19:10.375
You should too, man.

19:10.375 --> 19:11.208
- Travis--

19:11.208 --> 19:12.041
- This party's awesome.

19:12.041 --> 19:13.732
- It's stupid.

19:13.732 --> 19:14.715
You really wanted to have a party

19:14.715 --> 19:16.494
with these people this much?

19:16.494 --> 19:17.327
Yeah.

19:17.327 --> 19:18.324
- Well it's lame.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.763
- Okay, I heard this crazy
theory about the no planes.

19:21.763 --> 19:23.854
- Ah, that's a weird one.

19:23.854 --> 19:26.144
People that think that
there are no plants involved

19:26.144 --> 19:30.624
in 9/11, like it was drones
and planes were put in

19:30.624 --> 19:32.883
with special effects after the fact.

19:32.883 --> 19:35.075
- Come on, that's fucking nuts.

19:35.075 --> 19:37.383
- All right, moon isn't real.

19:37.383 --> 19:40.549
It's actually a large
hologram, emitting rays

19:40.549 --> 19:42.874
that keeps our brain running 10%,

19:42.874 --> 19:45.464
which makes human race be more opt

19:45.464 --> 19:47.738
to be stupid and slave-like.

19:47.738 --> 19:50.448
- There's no way people believe that shit.

19:50.448 --> 19:51.798
- David Icke, man.

19:51.798 --> 19:53.894
Crazy English motherfucker,

19:53.894 --> 19:57.944
who went nuts on TV in the
90s and said he was Jesus.

19:57.944 --> 20:02.583
He's the guy who's the huge
reptilian alien advocator.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.822
Dude has tons of followers.

20:04.822 --> 20:07.384
- How do you explain
the moon landing then?

20:07.384 --> 20:08.884
- Stanley Kubrick.

20:15.354 --> 20:17.585
- Don't ruin this.

20:17.585 --> 20:19.585
This is important to me.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.038
It's the most important thing.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.141
No, keep them off.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.354
- Where's Jenny?

21:24.354 --> 21:26.354
- I saw her go upstairs.

21:27.485 --> 21:28.515
- You saw them?

21:28.515 --> 21:29.824
Awhile ago.

21:29.824 --> 21:30.833
- You sure they went up there?

21:57.465 --> 21:59.525
- What are you guys doing up here?

21:59.525 --> 22:01.814
- Oh, you know, just
having a little alone time.

22:01.814 --> 22:03.834
- I'm fucking asking you a question.

22:03.834 --> 22:07.054
This is my house and my party.

22:07.054 --> 22:09.904
- Dude, relax, it's fine.

22:09.904 --> 22:11.915
- Don't tell me to relax.

22:11.915 --> 22:16.748
This is my house, my party, I
make the fucking rules here.

22:18.763 --> 22:22.144
- We were just trynna have
some fun, you know, no biggie.

22:22.144 --> 22:25.227
- No, it is a fucking big deal, okay?

22:27.485 --> 22:31.485
Nobody, and I mean nobody,
can go upstairs ever.

22:32.403 --> 22:36.395
Fucking never, everyone stay down here.

22:36.395 --> 22:38.312
I'm not fucking around.

22:41.553 --> 22:44.321
Let's just all have a
good time, all right?

23:05.175 --> 23:08.144
- What was all that about?

23:08.144 --> 23:09.145
- What, that?

23:09.145 --> 23:11.186
Nothing, man, it's all good.

23:11.186 --> 23:12.437
- Obviously not.

23:12.437 --> 23:13.737
- Oh, no, it is.

23:13.737 --> 23:14.978
I'm fine.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.208
Let's do a shot or something.

23:16.208 --> 23:19.016
- Dude, what is going on?

23:19.016 --> 23:22.260
There's some weird shit going on here.

23:22.260 --> 23:23.672
- What's up, fucktards?

23:23.672 --> 23:25.445
- Dude, did just hook up with Jenny again?

23:26.787 --> 23:28.834
Didn't you just do it like an hour ago?

23:28.834 --> 23:29.667
- Yeah.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.795
Oh, that's awesome.

23:31.795 --> 23:33.736
- You always gotta go for round two, bro.

23:33.736 --> 23:34.696
Second time you last longer.

23:34.696 --> 23:35.946
What?

23:39.316 --> 23:41.267
- Look, everybody's gotta
be good at something, right?

23:41.267 --> 23:42.368
- Yeah.

23:42.368 --> 23:44.227
- All right, well, I don't
really understand a whole lot

23:44.227 --> 23:47.157
about that school crap or any
of the shit you guys are into.

23:47.157 --> 23:50.004
But what I do understand is girls.

23:50.004 --> 23:52.504
- Oh, teach us, wise sex Yoda.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.099
- Jesus Christ.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.045
What room is this?

24:00.045 --> 24:01.916
- Doesn't matter.

24:18.594 --> 24:20.914
- Your shirt, no idea
what it fucking means,

24:20.914 --> 24:23.944
but Jenny, girls, them I understand.

24:23.944 --> 24:26.354
She came to our school,
what, beginning of the year,

24:26.354 --> 24:28.407
and we were hooking up two weeks later.

24:28.407 --> 24:30.081
It's not that complicated.

24:30.081 --> 24:32.000
- Well, I think Prometheus
makes more sense

24:32.000 --> 24:33.383
to me than vaginas.

24:33.383 --> 24:36.196
- No, no, no, see that's the thing.

24:36.196 --> 24:38.008
Vaginas aren't that complicated at all.

24:38.008 --> 24:38.933
Girls just want you to think that

24:38.933 --> 24:40.613
so that they can keep all the power.

24:40.613 --> 24:43.216
They're just like dicks, vaginas
are all basically the same.

24:43.216 --> 24:44.376
- Oh, shut up man.

24:44.376 --> 24:45.874
- I'm serious, dude.

24:45.874 --> 24:48.374
Look, how much porn you watch?

24:49.794 --> 24:51.906
- Like, I mean a lot.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.496
- All right, no, see that's the thing.

24:55.496 --> 24:57.688
Everything you need to
know, at least physically,

24:57.688 --> 24:59.133
you can essentially get from porn.

24:59.133 --> 25:00.136
What'd you mean?

25:00.136 --> 25:01.517
- Just try and remember this, okay.

25:01.517 --> 25:03.160
The clit is up here, okay.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.159
It's like a little dick.

25:04.159 --> 25:06.826
- Dude.
- Come on, a little dick?

25:21.550 --> 25:23.958
- Listen, you wanna
make Kristen cum, right?

25:23.958 --> 25:25.867
All right, all you gotta know is

25:25.867 --> 25:28.431
that it's clit stimulation
and rhythm, 'kay?

25:28.431 --> 25:29.736
Not to mention paying attention.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.547
Every girl likes things
a little bit differently,

25:31.547 --> 25:34.623
but the most important part
is paying attention, 'kay?

25:34.623 --> 25:35.723
There are signs.

25:35.723 --> 25:36.696
- Like what?

25:36.696 --> 25:38.568
- When you hit the right
spot, look for the sheet grab.

25:38.568 --> 25:40.576
Listen to her breathing, feel her thighs.

25:40.576 --> 25:43.243
This isn't rocket science, boys.

25:59.425 --> 26:00.691
- I've tried some shit.

26:00.691 --> 26:02.524
I still think she fakes it.

26:02.524 --> 26:04.855
- Well, why do you think Jenny
is into a guy like me anyway?

26:04.855 --> 26:05.825
Right?

26:05.825 --> 26:07.604
Is it because I'm so fucking smart,

26:07.604 --> 26:08.884
'cause I stimulate her mind?

26:08.884 --> 26:11.754
No, I got decent sized car,
we have sex all the time,

26:11.754 --> 26:13.025
and I make her cum.

26:13.025 --> 26:13.858
That's it.

26:14.724 --> 26:15.924
- Holy shit, man.

26:15.924 --> 26:17.684
I mean, that makes a lot of sense.

26:17.684 --> 26:19.636
- You know what, I'm
gonna leave you to that.

26:19.636 --> 26:21.120
You guys are hopeless.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.613
I'm gonna get another drink
and stay away from Travis.

26:23.613 --> 26:25.613
That guy's nucking futs.

26:27.396 --> 26:28.762
- Well, I thought it was smart, you know?

26:28.762 --> 26:32.836
- Oh, holy fuck, man, I need to get laid.

26:32.836 --> 26:33.864
- I'm your best friend.

26:33.864 --> 26:35.204
You can tell me.

26:35.204 --> 26:37.244
- What'd you mean?

26:37.244 --> 26:39.213
- The fucking cars in the driveway,

26:39.213 --> 26:42.014
the broken stuff over there.

26:42.014 --> 26:44.322
- I already said my parents
flew to Florida for the weekend.

26:44.322 --> 26:45.739
- I know, I know.

26:47.093 --> 26:49.402
And why do you have all that
shit all over your stomach?

26:49.402 --> 26:50.680
What?

26:50.680 --> 26:51.513
You know what I'm talking about.

26:51.513 --> 26:54.773
- No, no, no, this it's nothing.

26:54.773 --> 26:56.482
Everything is fine, man.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.528
It's more than fine.

26:58.528 --> 27:00.304
This party fucking rules, huh?

27:00.304 --> 27:02.720
you really hold me down

27:06.322 --> 27:08.994
with a quickie by the pool

27:37.260 --> 27:38.482
really sell that shit

27:54.692 --> 27:56.982
you really hold me down

27:56.982 --> 27:58.982
I'll be your best friend

28:00.662 --> 28:03.678
with a quickie by the pool

28:15.176 --> 28:16.009
- Exactly.

28:17.039 --> 28:17.872
- Okay, hold on.

28:17.872 --> 28:19.941
You're telling me that
if you could have voted,

28:19.941 --> 28:21.971
you would've voted for him.

28:21.971 --> 28:24.971
- To be honest, I don't really know.

28:25.864 --> 28:28.016
- Well, you're obviously fucking crazy.

28:28.016 --> 28:29.040
- What you gonna move to Canada

28:29.040 --> 28:31.120
like Lena Dunham or something?

28:31.120 --> 28:31.953
Nope.

28:31.953 --> 28:35.536
- And neither is she,
but maybe she should.

28:37.876 --> 28:40.821
- Travis is acting kinda
weird tonight though, right?

28:40.821 --> 28:44.856
- Look, Travis acting weird isn't weird.

28:44.856 --> 28:48.569
- Just saying he's got
some strange proclivities.

28:48.569 --> 28:50.069
- Proclivities?

28:50.069 --> 28:51.578
- Habits.

28:51.578 --> 28:54.432
- I know what the word means.

28:54.432 --> 28:58.182
- Oh, you just didn't
think I would, asshole.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.395
Hey, man, do you mind?

29:21.395 --> 29:23.205
- Yeah, sure.

29:39.694 --> 29:40.720
What is that?

29:40.720 --> 29:42.303
What?

29:42.303 --> 29:43.381
That.

29:43.381 --> 29:45.701
- I don't know, man.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.981
Think it's Jenny's shirt.

29:47.981 --> 29:50.178
- Looks like blood or something.

29:50.178 --> 29:53.688
- Yeah, well, do you think she's
on her period or something.

29:53.688 --> 29:55.228
- What? No.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.531
Why would it be on her shirt?

29:56.531 --> 30:00.771
- Yeah, well they won't
make any sense, unless--

30:00.771 --> 30:03.032
- Something happened, Scully.

30:03.032 --> 30:05.196
- Yo, man, Scully's the girl.

30:05.196 --> 30:07.792
If anything I'm like Fox Mulder.

30:17.714 --> 30:20.087
Is that my shirt?

30:20.087 --> 30:23.236
My shirt, I think you have it.

30:23.236 --> 30:24.736
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

30:27.151 --> 30:31.666
I think you got a stain
or something on there.

30:31.666 --> 30:33.166
- Oh, God damn it.

30:34.905 --> 30:36.145
Look at this shit.

30:36.145 --> 30:37.155
- The fuck is that?

30:53.595 --> 30:56.845
- So party's actually pretty cool, huh?

30:58.459 --> 31:00.459
- Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

31:02.546 --> 31:07.296
- Look I know I can kinda seem
like an asshole sometimes.

31:10.425 --> 31:12.882
I just, you know that makes it harder

31:12.882 --> 31:15.382
to come out and say this shit,

31:17.731 --> 31:19.564
but I really like you.

31:21.586 --> 31:23.919
- Yeah, I like you too much.

31:25.004 --> 31:27.804
- Well, no, but I'm serious.

31:27.804 --> 31:30.387
Like I really fucking like you.

31:38.516 --> 31:40.895
- You're just drunk or something, Mitch.

31:40.895 --> 31:43.535
Now is not the time for this conversation.

31:43.535 --> 31:44.604
- Why not?

31:44.604 --> 31:46.495
Why the fuck not?

31:46.495 --> 31:49.906
- This fucking stuff won't come out.

31:49.906 --> 31:51.574
- Why can't you even talk to me?

31:51.574 --> 31:55.324
I mean, I'm trying really
hard here, I just--

31:56.849 --> 31:58.700
- I know honey, and it's sweet.

31:58.700 --> 31:59.634
It really is.

31:59.634 --> 32:01.683
It's just, let's not do this

32:01.683 --> 32:04.850
in Travis Turner's laundry room, okay?

32:06.863 --> 32:09.599
- Didn't even say it back.

32:09.599 --> 32:10.991
- Yes, I did.

32:10.991 --> 32:12.074
- Not really.

32:12.975 --> 32:17.199
I mean, you can't even
seem to look at me like--

32:17.199 --> 32:19.236
- You like what we have, right?

32:19.236 --> 32:23.287
We have fun, we fuck,
you make me feel good,

32:23.287 --> 32:25.447
and I make you feel good.

32:25.447 --> 32:27.030
We're 17 years old.

32:28.087 --> 32:30.706
We couldn't hope for
anything more than this.

32:30.706 --> 32:34.289
I mean, even this is
so rare anymore, okay?

32:37.083 --> 32:40.416
Let's just enjoy what we have right now.

32:41.267 --> 32:42.604
- But what about when we have to--

32:42.604 --> 32:44.334
- It doesn't matter.

32:44.334 --> 32:45.758
If we have this conversation now,

32:45.758 --> 32:48.598
it's gonna ruin everything.

32:48.598 --> 32:51.657
Just don't fucking ruin it, okay?

32:51.657 --> 32:53.407
We have a good thing.

33:00.507 --> 33:02.257
We have a good thing.

33:06.457 --> 33:07.707
- Right, right.

35:40.602 --> 35:45.563
- Dude, tell me what the fuck
is going on with you tonight.

35:45.563 --> 35:46.974
- I don't know, man.

35:46.974 --> 35:49.562
I wanted to have a party,
so I threw a party.

35:49.562 --> 35:50.960
- Yeah, but with your parents.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.493
- This party though, right?

35:52.493 --> 35:55.389
- Listen, man, I don't wanna be a downer.

35:55.389 --> 35:56.893
There's some weird shit happen--

35:56.893 --> 35:59.167
- Don't bring that up now, dude.

35:59.167 --> 36:01.407
I just want to enjoy this night,

36:01.407 --> 36:04.298
and deal with everything else later.

36:04.298 --> 36:07.566
It's the everything else that scares me.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.658
We are seniors, man.

36:09.658 --> 36:13.719
We got a few months of this
fucking depressing high school

36:13.719 --> 36:16.159
and lame ass town to get through.

36:16.159 --> 36:18.359
And then that's it.

36:18.359 --> 36:21.859
All I wanted was to have one fucking night

36:23.165 --> 36:25.405
where it was about me.

36:25.405 --> 36:28.359
I was the one who threw
the wicked ass party.

36:28.359 --> 36:31.198
I wanted to be the one on
Monday where people said,

36:31.198 --> 36:32.727
"Were you at Travis's?

36:32.727 --> 36:34.858
"Oh shit, it was crazy."

36:34.858 --> 36:38.378
Where it didn't matter
how shitty my life was,

36:38.378 --> 36:40.461
or that I wasn't popular,

36:41.325 --> 36:42.908
or how happy I was,

36:44.829 --> 36:47.738
or my fucking retarded parents nagging me.

36:47.738 --> 36:49.869
None of that bullshit.

36:49.869 --> 36:52.039
Just a good party.

36:52.039 --> 36:53.372
It was all mine.

36:54.782 --> 36:56.115
That's it, dude.

36:56.989 --> 36:59.789
Is that too much to fucking ask?

36:59.789 --> 37:01.706
- The short answer, no.

37:03.069 --> 37:05.149
- Well then what is there to talk about?

37:05.149 --> 37:08.896
I fucking made it happen,
and it is awesome.

37:08.896 --> 37:11.279
You see those people in there?

37:11.279 --> 37:13.178
- They're only stoked
because you had a place

37:13.178 --> 37:15.598
with free beer on a Friday night.

37:15.598 --> 37:17.579
- You don't get it.

37:17.579 --> 37:19.350
That doesn't matter.

37:19.350 --> 37:22.183
I don't care if that's the reason.

37:23.490 --> 37:26.990
At least they came, and it was me, all me.

37:29.151 --> 37:30.068
I did this.

37:33.239 --> 37:35.322
- No, I get it man, I do.

37:40.076 --> 37:42.993
All right, You know Martin Shkreli?

37:44.559 --> 37:45.392
- The AIDS guy?

37:45.392 --> 37:46.261
- Yeah.

37:46.261 --> 37:47.878
- Didn't he jack up the price on the--

37:47.878 --> 37:49.279
- That's the one, yeah.

37:49.279 --> 37:50.181
- Fuck that dick sack.

37:50.181 --> 37:51.551
- Okay, see.

37:51.551 --> 37:54.890
What people don't know is
there's a reason why he did that.

37:54.890 --> 37:58.286
- 'cause he's a money hungry homo hater.

37:58.286 --> 37:59.369
- Well, yeah.

38:00.527 --> 38:03.767
But it's much more complicated than that.

38:03.767 --> 38:06.758
He realized that his product was inferior

38:06.758 --> 38:09.416
to the other medication on the market.

38:09.416 --> 38:11.647
And he wanted to raise money
to make his product better,

38:11.647 --> 38:12.965
and really to deter people

38:12.965 --> 38:15.718
from buying his less
than stellar medication

38:15.718 --> 38:19.458
to other products, which are better.

38:19.458 --> 38:23.967
- Hold on, are you fucking
defending this douche canoe?

38:23.967 --> 38:25.884
- Yeah, I guess, kinda.

38:27.967 --> 38:32.967
What I'm saying is is that
there's always two sides.

38:33.007 --> 38:36.607
Those people in there,
they see you as one way,

38:36.607 --> 38:41.107
like the weird kid is throwing
a party, and that's it.

38:42.588 --> 38:46.045
But I know it's not just that simple.

38:46.045 --> 38:47.730
There's something more happening,

38:47.730 --> 38:49.949
and it's not what everyone thinks it is.

39:10.165 --> 39:12.919
Something's happening tonight.

39:12.919 --> 39:15.669
Like, I mean, tonight felt weird.

39:17.078 --> 39:18.418
- I don't know, man.

39:18.418 --> 39:20.799
I just think Travis is a weird kid.

39:20.799 --> 39:23.318
Okay, and
what about the shirt?

39:23.318 --> 39:25.407
- Okay, so Jenny has
something on her shirt.

39:25.407 --> 39:27.078
Big fucking whoop.

39:27.078 --> 39:28.959
- The cars you see on the driveway?

39:28.959 --> 39:30.789
- His parents could just
be out for the night.

39:30.789 --> 39:32.372
- Okay, okay, sure.

39:33.269 --> 39:35.782
What is it with the upstairs?

39:35.782 --> 39:37.917
Why did Travis freaked the fuck out

39:37.917 --> 39:40.746
when Mitch and Jenny were up there, huh?

39:40.746 --> 39:42.337
- Yeah, that was weird.

39:42.337 --> 39:43.170
- Yeah.

39:44.138 --> 39:46.666
- So what does this all mean then?

39:46.666 --> 39:48.793
- I don't know, man.

39:48.793 --> 39:52.912
I'm pretty sure that was
blood on Jenny's shirt.

39:52.912 --> 39:56.617
- Maybe Travis is gonna like
start a cult or something,

39:56.617 --> 39:58.857
and all the beer has been laced with shit,

39:58.857 --> 40:00.207
and everything we've been saying

40:00.207 --> 40:02.537
and doing is just some
crazy hallucination,

40:02.537 --> 40:05.185
and really it's Travis
way of converting us

40:05.185 --> 40:07.407
into some Charles Manson type thing,

40:07.407 --> 40:11.606
where he gets us to murder
celebrities and shit.

40:11.606 --> 40:13.251
- Fuck, dude.

40:13.251 --> 40:15.030
That's insane.

40:15.030 --> 40:17.108
I think
it's weirder than that.

40:38.140 --> 40:39.801
- I'm not some fucking stranger.

40:39.801 --> 40:41.219
I know you.

40:41.219 --> 40:42.380
- I know that.

40:42.380 --> 40:44.130
- Okay, so then what?

40:45.194 --> 40:47.567
Your fucking parents are
hard on you, so what?

40:47.567 --> 40:49.754
At least they care.

40:49.754 --> 40:52.230
You know what I have to go
through every day being what I am

40:52.230 --> 40:53.791
in this place, going to school?

40:53.791 --> 40:54.624
- Oh, here it comes.

40:54.624 --> 40:55.652
The fucking sob story.

40:55.652 --> 40:58.662
- It's not, man, it's fucking reality.

40:58.662 --> 41:01.353
I mean, you are a straight white dude

41:01.353 --> 41:02.793
with two parents that love you enough

41:02.793 --> 41:06.423
to care about what you do with your life.

41:06.423 --> 41:08.064
My parents?

41:08.064 --> 41:11.303
I mean, my dad, who knows
where that fucktard is.

41:11.303 --> 41:13.543
And my mom's so in denial about me,

41:13.543 --> 41:16.960
she pretends I'm still a normal teenager.

41:18.593 --> 41:21.156
Not a sob story, man.

41:21.156 --> 41:22.656
It's just reality.

41:23.870 --> 41:25.372
Just because you don't
have any real struggles,

41:25.372 --> 41:28.711
doesn't mean you should
just blow up the small shit.

41:28.711 --> 41:30.383
Shit, man, even with all my shit,

41:30.383 --> 41:32.716
I still have it pretty good.

41:33.652 --> 41:35.128
You know how many countries would kill me

41:35.128 --> 41:36.878
because of what I am?

41:42.838 --> 41:45.890
- They were going to send me away.

41:45.890 --> 41:46.964
- What?

41:46.964 --> 41:51.018
- Yeah, it's like a
rehab thing or some shit.

41:51.018 --> 41:53.601
They were going to ship me off.

41:54.876 --> 41:56.335
- Well, maybe that'd be good.

41:56.335 --> 41:58.255
- Fucking no, dude.

41:58.255 --> 41:59.755
I want to be here.

42:01.235 --> 42:03.796
So what, I do some drugs.

42:03.796 --> 42:05.127
Sometimes I feel like dying,

42:05.127 --> 42:07.544
but what fucking kid doesn't?

42:08.847 --> 42:10.676
- I think it's more than just that, man.

42:10.676 --> 42:12.759
- Oh, fuck, not you, too.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.996
I don't need help.

42:15.996 --> 42:20.996
I just wanna finish school,
and get the fuck outta here.

42:21.148 --> 42:23.981
Well, and have a party, of course.

42:24.938 --> 42:26.021
- Wait, were?

42:28.094 --> 42:28.927
- What?

42:30.548 --> 42:32.628
- You said, "were."

42:32.628 --> 42:35.128
They were gonna send you away.

42:36.074 --> 42:36.907
- Yeah.

42:39.079 --> 42:40.746
And now they aren't.

42:45.748 --> 42:47.248
- And why is that?

42:52.519 --> 42:54.894
I'm not an idiot, man.

42:54.894 --> 42:58.561
Your parents' car's in
the fucking driveway.

43:02.258 --> 43:05.008
They aren't in Florida, are they?

43:10.039 --> 43:12.706
So where the fuck are they then?

43:16.885 --> 43:17.802
- Upstairs.

43:22.018 --> 43:23.685
- Like in the house?

43:38.989 --> 43:41.290
- He just doesn't take me seriously.

43:41.290 --> 43:43.400
He thinks I'm stupid.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.340
- I'm sure that's not true.

43:45.340 --> 43:47.935
- You saw how he was out there.

43:47.935 --> 43:51.949
- Guys are more emotionally
stupid in front of other guys.

43:51.949 --> 43:55.290
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

43:55.290 --> 43:57.540
- Maybe I'm just too drunk.

43:59.841 --> 44:02.091
It's his stupid, cute face.

44:05.042 --> 44:09.375
I just wanna slap him and
kiss him at the same time.

44:11.403 --> 44:13.153
- Yeah, I can relate.

44:15.602 --> 44:17.019
Just talk to him.

44:20.023 --> 44:22.162
- Yeah, I mean you're right.

44:30.018 --> 44:31.551
- You talking to me now?

44:31.551 --> 44:32.384
- Shut up.

44:33.369 --> 44:35.609
Let's just get out of here.

44:35.609 --> 44:38.409
- I kind of want to stay
until they get back.

44:38.409 --> 44:42.060
- Yeah, I wanna see how
this whole thing plays out.

44:42.060 --> 44:43.449
- I got a theory.

44:43.449 --> 44:45.087
- Let's hear it.

44:45.087 --> 44:48.087
- Okay, so we've got a bloody shirt,

44:48.982 --> 44:51.129
cars are still in the driveway,

44:51.129 --> 44:52.940
Travis is being all weird.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.089
- Yeah.

44:54.089 --> 44:55.672
- So what if, okay,

44:59.156 --> 45:01.823
what if Travis took his parents,

45:03.441 --> 45:05.441
and like locked them up,

45:07.910 --> 45:10.993
so he can actually control the house,

45:11.972 --> 45:14.809
and let his parents out as a cover,

45:14.809 --> 45:17.226
but really he runs the house,

45:18.359 --> 45:21.980
and keeps them chained up and locked away,

45:21.980 --> 45:24.675
so he can do crazy shit.

45:24.675 --> 45:27.758
And maybe they're upstairs right now.

45:30.788 --> 45:33.288
Rabid, hungry, and chained up.

45:36.308 --> 45:40.134
- You've watched too many
fucking movies, dude.

45:40.134 --> 45:40.967
- Maybe.

45:44.477 --> 45:46.279
- We're the only ones left.

45:46.279 --> 45:48.989
You guys sure you wanna stay?

45:48.989 --> 45:49.822
- Yeah.

45:58.210 --> 45:59.966
- And the marks on your body,

45:59.966 --> 46:01.515
the fucking broken shit in the house,

46:01.515 --> 46:02.932
the bloody shirt.

46:04.896 --> 46:07.275
- I just wanted a party, man.

46:07.275 --> 46:08.108
One night.

46:10.289 --> 46:11.662
They took my phone,

46:11.662 --> 46:12.942
they took my drugs.

46:12.942 --> 46:15.275
I couldn't do anything, man.

46:17.741 --> 46:19.789
They were gonna send me away.

46:19.789 --> 46:20.891
Fucking away, man.

46:20.891 --> 46:22.742
- So then what?

46:22.742 --> 46:24.861
- You already know, man.

46:24.861 --> 46:25.910
You already know.

46:25.910 --> 46:27.302
- No, I don't, dude.

46:27.302 --> 46:29.661
I don't fucking know.

46:29.661 --> 46:31.190
Tell me.

46:31.190 --> 46:32.411
Say the fucking words.

46:32.411 --> 46:34.651
I wanna hear them from
your God damn mouth.

46:34.651 --> 46:35.984
- Nope, I can't.

46:37.341 --> 46:40.008
- You fucking can, and you will.

46:48.730 --> 46:50.480
- I killed them both.

47:01.793 --> 47:04.126
- It can't be that bad, man.

47:05.612 --> 47:06.445
- It is.

47:07.982 --> 47:10.482
- I don't fucking believe you.

47:11.404 --> 47:12.702
- Well, it's true.

47:12.702 --> 47:16.382
- Well, I don't believe you, I just don't.

47:16.382 --> 47:19.549
There's no way you could've done that.

47:24.252 --> 47:27.419
- They're upstairs dead, and I did it.

47:33.852 --> 47:36.113
- You are fucked up.

47:36.113 --> 47:39.030
And maybe you need some help, dude.

47:40.442 --> 47:43.453
There's no way you could have done that.

47:43.453 --> 47:45.203
You're a good person.

47:46.153 --> 47:47.403
We are friends.

47:48.993 --> 47:49.910
I know you.

47:51.382 --> 47:53.934
Remember my fifth birthday party?

47:53.934 --> 47:55.913
You got that sweet Return of the Jedi book

47:55.913 --> 47:57.830
with pictures and shit.

47:58.942 --> 48:00.364
You're still that awesome kid,

48:00.364 --> 48:04.334
who'd do anything for his friends, for me.

48:04.334 --> 48:07.533
Broke some kid's nose for me.

48:07.533 --> 48:12.233
I remember thinking this
kid is fucking awesome.

48:12.233 --> 48:14.284
If you'd do that for me
when we're just classmates,

48:14.284 --> 48:16.451
he's gotta be a great guy.

48:17.782 --> 48:19.341
- I don't know, man.

48:19.341 --> 48:23.091
I know it's bad, and I
don't know what to do.

48:26.023 --> 48:30.023
I know I'm fucked, and I
just want to be better.

48:31.924 --> 48:35.134
I don't know how or what to do.

48:35.134 --> 48:37.301
I just want to get better.

48:39.844 --> 48:44.427
I know I'm fucked, and I know
I'm so fucked, and like--

48:46.132 --> 48:47.715
What am I gonna do?

48:51.061 --> 48:53.811
- It's all right, it's all right.

48:55.342 --> 48:57.012
I still don't believe you.

48:57.012 --> 48:58.845
I just really I don't.

49:01.900 --> 49:06.628
I see you crying and shit,
but I can't believe you.

49:06.628 --> 49:07.461
I won't.

49:10.694 --> 49:12.194
Not without proof.

49:15.415 --> 49:16.832
- You want proof?

49:19.455 --> 49:21.205
I can show you proof.

49:26.066 --> 49:27.983
- Show them to me then.

49:29.305 --> 49:33.888
I wanna see their bodies when
we get back to the party.

49:36.567 --> 49:37.400
- Okay.

49:43.516 --> 49:44.766
Ben, I'm sorry.

49:49.079 --> 49:49.912
I'm sorry.

49:57.454 --> 49:59.787
- You will get through this.

50:01.709 --> 50:02.959
I promise, man.

50:04.197 --> 50:06.778
It's probably not as bad as you think.

50:06.778 --> 50:07.829
You're all fucked up right now.

50:07.829 --> 50:10.579
It's probably not that bad, okay?

50:11.738 --> 50:13.676
Tell me things
are going to be okay.

50:16.360 --> 50:18.277
- I can't do that, man.

50:19.127 --> 50:19.960
- Okay.

50:26.332 --> 50:27.413
- What the hell?

50:27.413 --> 50:28.663
What the fuck, man?

50:28.663 --> 50:29.813
Where is everyone?

50:29.813 --> 50:30.646
Why did they leave?

50:30.646 --> 50:31.479
What the fuck?

50:31.479 --> 50:32.952
- Hey, hey, hey cool it, man.

50:32.952 --> 50:34.602
It's all right.

50:34.602 --> 50:35.442
It's pretty late,

50:35.442 --> 50:36.962
and everyone was pretty
fucked up when we left.

50:36.962 --> 50:37.795
- I don't care.

50:37.795 --> 50:38.903
They shouldn't just leave.

50:38.903 --> 50:39.790
Who does that?

50:39.790 --> 50:41.123
- Hey, upstairs?

50:43.550 --> 50:44.954
Lead the way.

51:30.801 --> 51:32.529
- You guys need to go.

51:32.529 --> 51:33.590
- What?

51:33.590 --> 51:36.525
- Yeah, come on man, it's a party.

51:36.525 --> 51:38.097
- Not really anymore.

51:38.097 --> 51:40.597
- Everyone needs to leave now.

51:41.727 --> 51:43.116
- Guys, let's go.

52:05.543 --> 52:08.137
Thanks for the party, Travis.

52:09.875 --> 52:12.618
- Shut up, let's just go.

52:28.858 --> 52:29.691
- What are you doing?

52:29.691 --> 52:31.274
- I want a picture.

52:39.058 --> 52:41.058
- I'm like really drunk.

52:42.936 --> 52:44.230
Don't even fucking say it.

52:44.230 --> 52:45.063
- I wasn't.

52:45.063 --> 52:46.236
- Yeah, you definitely were.

52:46.236 --> 52:47.069
- Nope.

52:48.337 --> 52:50.417
- You were being an asshole before.

52:50.417 --> 52:51.334
- I wasn't.

52:53.145 --> 52:55.743
- Do you really think I'm stupid?

52:55.743 --> 52:57.423
- I think you're beautiful.

52:57.423 --> 52:58.994
- I'm serious.

52:58.994 --> 53:00.543
- I don't think you're stupid.

53:00.543 --> 53:02.085
I think maybe you're just more complicated

53:02.085 --> 53:03.835
than I maybe thought.

53:07.134 --> 53:08.143
- What's that?

53:08.143 --> 53:09.342
- On my hand?

53:09.342 --> 53:10.175
- Obvi.

53:11.337 --> 53:12.773
- DBC.

53:12.773 --> 53:13.893
- Yeah, I can see that.

53:13.893 --> 53:14.773
What does it mean?

53:14.773 --> 53:16.591
- Don't be cuddly.

53:16.591 --> 53:18.259
- Has that been there the whole night?

53:18.259 --> 53:19.092
- Mhm.

53:19.092 --> 53:20.219
- Why?

53:20.219 --> 53:23.361
- To remind myself not
to be cuddly with anyone.

53:23.361 --> 53:26.294
It is a party, and when I get drunk--

53:26.294 --> 53:29.711
- Okay, I think you're the fucking idiot.

53:36.649 --> 53:37.947
- Let's get back to my place.

53:37.947 --> 53:39.729
I've got some things I wanna try.

53:39.729 --> 53:41.449
- Oh, yes, finally.

53:48.261 --> 53:51.761
You know what I have to do, right?

53:52.661 --> 53:53.494
Travis?

53:56.371 --> 53:59.251
How can you be this calm?

53:59.251 --> 54:01.542
You realize the position you've put me in?

54:01.542 --> 54:02.380
- Hey, man.

54:02.380 --> 54:04.430
I didn't make you play Sherlock
fucking Holmes tonight.

54:04.430 --> 54:07.013
Okay, you did that on your own.

54:09.283 --> 54:13.866
- You really don't see how
hard this is for me, do you?

54:14.990 --> 54:16.240
You don't care.

54:18.495 --> 54:21.697
- Do what you have to do then.

54:21.697 --> 54:23.447
- Where are you, man?

54:24.491 --> 54:25.970
How can you be on that shit right now?

54:25.970 --> 54:29.825
Your fucking parents are dead up there.

54:29.825 --> 54:31.158
- Yes, they are.

54:37.939 --> 54:41.439
- And your best friend has to turn you in.

54:45.553 --> 54:48.220
I have to make the fucking call.

54:50.502 --> 54:52.919
- Do what you think is right.

54:54.353 --> 54:56.593
- You understand when
I walk out that door,

54:56.593 --> 54:58.010
it's over, right?

55:00.322 --> 55:02.822
We don't see each other again.

55:03.963 --> 55:06.251
Take care, man.

55:06.251 --> 55:07.751
Thanks for coming.

55:26.728 --> 55:29.699
- You know, Jenny, I love you--

55:29.699 --> 55:31.190
- Don't say it.

55:31.190 --> 55:32.819
You're drunk.

55:32.819 --> 55:36.919
Let's just walk home and
fall asleep together, okay?

55:36.919 --> 55:41.336
- But we should be together
for fucking like forever.

55:43.400 --> 55:46.528
- If by forever you mean
until the end of this year,

55:46.528 --> 55:48.528
then yes, yes we should.

55:50.167 --> 55:52.250
- You're awesome and hot.

55:53.725 --> 55:54.558
- Thanks.

55:57.465 --> 55:59.288
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

55:59.288 --> 56:01.728
We're still gonna fuck until then, right?

56:01.728 --> 56:02.645
- Uh, yeah.

56:03.879 --> 56:05.510
- Okay, good.

56:05.510 --> 56:07.030
I like that part.

56:07.030 --> 56:07.863
- Me, too.

56:29.419 --> 56:31.086
- Wait, don't leave.

56:35.912 --> 56:37.162
I'm not normal.

56:40.022 --> 56:43.605
I'm not like the rest
of these people, man.

56:45.753 --> 56:48.836
I'm fucked up, like really fucked up.

56:53.814 --> 56:56.731
I don't see things, or feel things,

56:59.862 --> 57:04.029
or deal with things the
same way as everyone else.

57:07.382 --> 57:11.715
I actually can't even believe
I even had one friend.

57:16.742 --> 57:19.753
I don't deserve any friends.

57:19.753 --> 57:21.670
Let alone a girlfriend.

57:25.732 --> 57:28.149
I haven't figured myself out.

57:29.804 --> 57:33.804
Haven't figured out how
to deal with being this,

57:41.003 --> 57:41.836
being me.

57:45.033 --> 57:49.783
Until I do, I can't honestly
live any kind of normal life

57:54.772 --> 57:58.189
or be a part of anyone's life in any way.

58:03.273 --> 58:05.106
Maybe being by myself,

58:07.231 --> 58:08.648
away from people,

58:09.644 --> 58:11.144
away from society,

58:13.384 --> 58:15.467
is the best thing for me.

58:19.404 --> 58:20.904
- That's bullshit.

58:23.462 --> 58:26.096
You weren't fucking special.

58:26.096 --> 58:26.929
- Thanks.

58:28.221 --> 58:32.544
- What I mean is that
every kid is fucked up

58:32.544 --> 58:35.211
in some way now, especially now.

58:36.523 --> 58:41.490
Jesus dude, look at the way we
communicate with each other,

58:41.490 --> 58:43.573
what we're obsessed with.

58:47.838 --> 58:50.822
- But you did figure it out.

58:50.822 --> 58:51.655
- Yeah.

58:54.463 --> 58:57.222
But you I think I did that on my own,

58:57.222 --> 58:59.055
without anyone's help?

59:01.408 --> 59:04.184
You aren't any different
than the rest of us.

59:04.184 --> 59:05.267
No different.

59:07.104 --> 59:10.164
And the fact that you
think you need to be alone

59:10.164 --> 59:14.997
or away from society is just
the biggest fucking lie, man.

59:20.454 --> 59:24.371
This shit, this thing,
the communities on here,

59:25.505 --> 59:28.005
it means fucking nothing, man.

59:29.225 --> 59:30.642
It's a quick fix.

59:33.124 --> 59:37.313
The shit on here tells
us that we need to be

59:37.313 --> 59:40.305
at a certain place in our life,

59:40.305 --> 59:44.638
look a certain way to get
a girlfriend or boyfriend,

59:45.512 --> 59:47.179
or have any friends.

59:50.084 --> 59:52.964
And actually thinking that
someday in the future,

59:52.964 --> 59:55.414
you'll be at this place
where everything is better,

59:55.414 --> 59:58.425
and you become this
fantastic version of yourself

59:58.425 --> 1:00:03.092
to get all those things is
fucking shit, fucking insane.

1:00:04.694 --> 1:00:06.194
Stupid shit, dude.

1:00:09.944 --> 1:00:13.777
- So what, what's the
big fucking secret then?

1:00:16.753 --> 1:00:17.586
- Others.

1:00:19.313 --> 1:00:20.146
- What?

1:00:21.204 --> 1:00:22.454
- Other people.

1:00:23.494 --> 1:00:26.644
Talking to real people,
making real friends,

1:00:26.644 --> 1:00:30.311
making real connections,
not this fake shit.

1:00:32.264 --> 1:00:36.056
The only way you're gonna feel better

1:00:36.056 --> 1:00:38.139
is if you talk to people.

1:00:41.412 --> 1:00:42.329
- Like you?

1:00:44.274 --> 1:00:45.607
- Yeah, like me.

1:00:49.543 --> 1:00:51.543
The only chance you, we,

1:00:54.489 --> 1:00:58.239
have is to connect with
the people around us.

1:01:01.340 --> 1:01:02.257
You, Ricky,

1:01:04.951 --> 1:01:08.216
talking to other kids that
feel the same way I do.

1:01:08.216 --> 1:01:13.049
That's what helped me to become
comfortable with who I am.

1:01:22.503 --> 1:01:26.086
- Well, I don't have
that luxury now, do I?

1:01:41.538 --> 1:01:43.538
- So I've been thinking,

1:01:45.100 --> 1:01:48.591
like maybe we just accept
that you may never know

1:01:48.591 --> 1:01:50.671
what exactly happened tonight.

1:01:50.671 --> 1:01:54.271
Okay, maybe,
but that's kind of boring.

1:01:54.271 --> 1:01:59.271
- Like maybe just, maybe,
Travis is a weird fucking kid,

1:01:59.580 --> 1:02:02.409
who just threw a party to have fun,

1:02:02.409 --> 1:02:04.742
and really nothing happened.

1:02:05.696 --> 1:02:08.358
- You're always rambling on
about conspiracy theories,

1:02:08.358 --> 1:02:10.158
and we can finally have
one here in our town

1:02:10.158 --> 1:02:12.528
at a party we were at.

1:02:12.528 --> 1:02:14.249
I guess.

1:02:14.249 --> 1:02:16.300
Maybe a little mystery is good.

1:02:16.300 --> 1:02:18.924
But it's fun to
talk about though, right?

1:02:18.924 --> 1:02:21.007
- I don't know.

1:02:21.007 --> 1:02:21.969
He's just weird,

1:02:21.969 --> 1:02:25.759
like
right in front of you.

1:02:25.759 --> 1:02:30.095
That's actually
a really sound point, Mike.

1:02:30.095 --> 1:02:31.678
Wow, I'm surprised.

1:02:33.834 --> 1:02:36.105
- Maybe not every story,

1:02:36.105 --> 1:02:41.105
not every character used
a  bow tie.

1:02:42.702 --> 1:02:44.420
Maybe it's better we'll never know

1:02:44.420 --> 1:02:46.601
what exactly happened tonight.

1:02:46.601 --> 1:02:49.241
Eh, you could be right.

1:02:49.241 --> 1:02:52.020
- Or maybe, you're too
scared what the truth

1:02:52.020 --> 1:02:53.937
of tonight actually is.

1:02:59.864 --> 1:03:01.864
So, now what?

1:03:04.954 --> 1:03:06.287
- You know what.

1:03:07.291 --> 1:03:10.012
Have to make the call, I have to.

1:03:10.012 --> 1:03:10.845
- Okay.

1:03:16.397 --> 1:03:20.064
- Things are gonna be
different from now on.

1:03:21.167 --> 1:03:22.000
- I know.

1:03:24.445 --> 1:03:27.945
- This doesn't have to be the end for you,

1:03:28.909 --> 1:03:30.742
but I have to do this.

1:03:32.918 --> 1:03:33.751
- I know.

1:03:35.858 --> 1:03:36.914
- I better go.

1:03:36.914 --> 1:03:38.302
I might never leave.

1:03:38.302 --> 1:03:39.135
- Okay.

1:05:28.511 --> 1:05:33.511
it's what I have left

1:07:22.566 --> 1:07:24.035
Mom and dad,

1:07:24.035 --> 1:07:27.126
I am writing this on
Tuesday, December 15th.

1:07:27.126 --> 1:07:28.791
You guys have grounded me for months

1:07:28.791 --> 1:07:31.252
after the incident
involving my English teacher

1:07:31.252 --> 1:07:33.315
and some drug bullshit.

1:07:33.315 --> 1:07:34.812
I have no phone,

1:07:34.812 --> 1:07:37.678
I can't talk to anyone outside of school.

1:07:37.678 --> 1:07:41.051
I sit here in this fucking
house day after day,

1:07:41.051 --> 1:07:43.623
hating you both more and more.

1:07:43.623 --> 1:07:46.795
Even after grounding me, I
still get high every day.

1:07:46.795 --> 1:07:49.863
And two days ago you found my stash.

1:07:49.863 --> 1:07:52.296
Mom, you broke down and cried,

1:07:52.296 --> 1:07:55.795
while dad, you yelled
your fucking ass off.

1:07:55.795 --> 1:07:59.846
Boarding school, rehab, fuck all of that.

1:07:59.846 --> 1:08:03.336
I will never go to those places ever.

1:08:03.336 --> 1:08:05.664
All I want to do is throw an epic party

1:08:05.664 --> 1:08:07.486
before senior year ends.

1:08:07.486 --> 1:08:08.663
That's it.

1:08:08.663 --> 1:08:10.395
That's all I want.

1:08:10.395 --> 1:08:12.006
I know it may never happen,

1:08:12.006 --> 1:08:15.873
but I dream of it every day, every night.

1:08:15.873 --> 1:08:16.984
So fuck it.

1:08:16.984 --> 1:08:18.488
Fuck it all.

1:08:18.488 --> 1:08:20.616
I'm gonna throw a party no matter what,

1:08:20.616 --> 1:08:22.627
and it will be awesome.

1:08:22.627 --> 1:08:25.364
Without any love, Travis.
