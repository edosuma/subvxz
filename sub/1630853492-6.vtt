in the club with your crew,

by Popclaw,

23:00.129 --> 23:01.255
you piece of shit.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.132
Hey, uh, you free
for a little catch-up?

23:03.216 --> 23:06.094
You know what? I'm-I'm
a little slammed right now.

23:06.177 --> 23:09.639
Oh, come on.
Ten minutes won't kill you.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.023
Hey, so, uh, where's Hughie?

23:19.107 --> 23:20.691
Oh, he's just camping
with his dad

23:20.775 --> 23:22.193
for a couple of days.

23:22.276 --> 23:25.655
[laughs] Okay. Okay, good.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.198
Oh, great. I thought
he was avoiding me

23:27.281 --> 23:28.491
- or something, you know...
- No, no.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.451
...'cause he was scared
I was gonna pop his head.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.328
[swallows]

23:32.411 --> 23:33.538
Hmm?

23:33.621 --> 23:35.248
Come on, Annie.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.000
Put them away.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.002
I'm not gonna hurt you

23:40.086 --> 23:41.963
or Hughie or your families.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.215
Besides, you'd lose.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.135
Then why are you here?

23:47.218 --> 23:48.803
Because I want to help you.

23:48.886 --> 23:52.098
Huh. Help.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.642
From the psycho
who blew up Congress.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.019
Look, most of those guys
passed around deepfakes of me

23:57.103 --> 23:59.063
on the House floor
blowing bin Laden,

23:59.147 --> 24:01.149
so I'm not exactly overwhelmed
with sympathy.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.735
Annie, you need me.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.279
You're all alone.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.406
I mean, come on,
that "hashtag Homelight" shit?

24:08.489 --> 24:10.366
That looks like you're in
a hostage video.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.659
Blink twice if I'm wrong.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.327
And, what, you got to play nice
with the guy

24:13.411 --> 24:14.829
that throat-fucked you
on your first day of work.

24:14.912 --> 24:18.916
And Maeve, they say Maeve
is in rehab,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.086
but you and I both know
she's probably dead.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.588
I'm all you got.

24:23.671 --> 24:26.591
Come on, Annie,
you and I were friends.

24:26.674 --> 24:28.467
None of that
has changed for me.

24:28.551 --> 24:30.136
Are you ever gonna get
to the point?

24:32.346 --> 24:34.724
You have 193 million
Instagram followers.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.059
Lend me your influence,
and I'll lend you mine.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.061
I can protect you
from Homelander.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.939
You'll finally
be team captain for real.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.816
And in return, you help me
goose my numbers.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.944
I can finally get
my education reform bill passed.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.863
We can make things
better, Annie.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.073
For my daughter,

24:51.157 --> 24:52.909
for a lot of daughters.

24:54.702 --> 24:57.872
Come on, what do you say?

25:02.210 --> 25:03.669
You're right.

25:07.548 --> 25:11.093
This whole place.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.138
I'm so fucking tired...

25:16.933 --> 25:19.185
...of listening
to people tell me

25:19.268 --> 25:22.271
I need to be shitty
in order to win.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.234
Fuck you.

25:26.317 --> 25:29.403
And fuck Homelander,
and fuck Vought

25:29.487 --> 25:32.573
and this
"whatever it takes" crap.

25:32.657 --> 25:33.824
You're just gonna end up

25:33.908 --> 25:37.078
sitting on top
of the steaming pile of shit

25:37.161 --> 25:39.413
that you built.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.332
I'm done.

25:41.415 --> 25:44.543
I'm fucking done.
I'm not doing it anymore.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.128
You're not gonna be
doing anything

25:46.212 --> 25:47.296
if Homelander kills you.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.839
Yeah, maybe.

25:48.923 --> 25:52.093
But then I'll know I'm not
working with a fucking nutjob.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.887
So, either pop my head

25:54.971 --> 25:57.139
or get the hell out.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.033
Hey, keep this between us?

26:16.117 --> 26:19.662
It'd be really tough to take out
America's sweetheart,

26:19.745 --> 26:22.081
but not impossible.

26:30.131 --> 26:31.757
[door opens]

26:33.259 --> 26:35.177
[door closes]

26:54.613 --> 26:56.490
I'm so sorry.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.122
[Frenchie] No.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.832
[grunting]

27:10.713 --> 27:14.008
[panting] No. S'il vous plait,

27:14.091 --> 27:16.510
no. Don't do this.

27:16.594 --> 27:18.971
His body is a masterpiece, no?

27:20.431 --> 27:23.017
[inhales]

27:23.100 --> 27:27.438
Do you know the story
behind this one? [exhales]

27:27.521 --> 27:30.941
Oh, years ago, my cousin Kolya
went State's witness, so

27:31.025 --> 27:33.361
I send my Serge. Not even three

27:33.444 --> 27:36.030
bullets could stop
my attack dog.

27:37.365 --> 27:41.285
Bar fight on the Basque coast.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.120
He started it.

27:43.204 --> 27:46.332
Oh, my beast.
This is my favorite.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.251
When Serge was

27:49.335 --> 27:52.046
14 years old,
he dropped a glass.

27:52.129 --> 27:55.049
His father told him
to kneel in the shards

27:55.132 --> 27:57.301
and not move until he said so.

27:57.385 --> 28:01.889
Little Serge
did not shift an inch,

28:01.972 --> 28:04.100
not even after his father left
to get drunk

28:04.183 --> 28:06.060
and pass out in the whorehouse.

28:07.812 --> 28:09.980
Oh, please, don't cry for Serge.

28:10.064 --> 28:12.108
He likes to be told what to do.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.443
And he loves to be punished

28:14.527 --> 28:16.278
when he's bad.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.905
Makes him hard.

28:19.448 --> 28:20.449
No.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.201
So... Cherie...

28:22.284 --> 28:23.244
- No.
- [Little Nina] ...or Kimiko?

28:23.327 --> 28:25.204
[Frenchie] No, don't do it.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.456
Don't do this! Nina!

28:27.540 --> 28:28.541
[Little Nina] You must
choose, Serge.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.875
If not, I will kill

28:29.959 --> 28:31.710
both of them,
and when you've finished

28:31.794 --> 28:34.213
screaming, crying,
I will kill you, too.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.757
[speaking French]

28:41.011 --> 28:42.555
- Choose.
- No.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.224
- [gunshot]
- [screams]

28:48.352 --> 28:49.437
- Fuck.
- [gasps]

28:49.520 --> 28:51.313
- [gunfire]
- [Frenchie shouts]

28:54.275 --> 28:55.276
[grunts]

28:55.359 --> 28:57.403
[panting]

28:59.405 --> 29:01.157
[grunts]

29:01.240 --> 29:02.616
No.

29:04.118 --> 29:05.536
[screams]

29:05.619 --> 29:07.371
[grunts]

29:12.668 --> 29:15.087
- [screams]
- [coughs]

29:15.171 --> 29:17.173
[gasps]

29:17.256 --> 29:18.549
[grunts]

29:23.804 --> 29:25.139
[Frenchie] Kimiko, run!

29:32.146 --> 29:33.647
[Frenchie] Kimiko!

29:34.565 --> 29:35.399
No!

29:35.483 --> 29:37.818
[grunts]

29:37.902 --> 29:39.904
[grunts, gasps]

29:50.414 --> 29:52.208
[pants]

29:54.001 --> 29:55.669
[gasping]

29:57.213 --> 30:00.132
Oh, fuck! [screams]
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

30:15.147 --> 30:17.107
- [panting]
- [Frenchie] Mon coeur.

30:17.191 --> 30:19.693
Mon coeur.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.487
She's gone.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.406
[panting] Nina's gone.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.202
It's over.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.996
- [sighs]
- [Frenchie] It's over.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.174
Have you always had that?

30:44.385 --> 30:45.761
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:51.225 --> 30:53.769
[sighs] I grew up in Harlem,

30:53.852 --> 30:56.188
brownstone filled with family.

30:56.272 --> 30:59.233
Grandparents, uncles,
aunts, cousins.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.485
One night,

31:01.569 --> 31:03.404
there was a ruckus outside.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.782
I looked out the window,
and it was Soldier Boy.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.826
He had pulled up on some kids
that were trying

31:08.909 --> 31:12.705
to boost a Benz, and so I run
and wake up my granddad.

31:12.788 --> 31:16.125
"Grandpa, Grandpa.
It's Soldier Boy. Come look."

31:16.208 --> 31:18.752
Soldier Boy takes the Benz,

31:18.836 --> 31:20.671
and he hurls it
through our house,

31:20.754 --> 31:22.590
like a fucking freight train.

31:22.673 --> 31:25.384
It missed me
by about six inches.

31:25.467 --> 31:28.178
And my grandpa...

31:28.262 --> 31:30.097
One minute he was there...

31:32.516 --> 31:34.518
...and then he wasn't.

31:36.145 --> 31:38.105
And I woke him up.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.065
I put him in that spot.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.569
That is not your fault.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.446
[Mother's Milk] That's when
this whole OCD shit started.

31:45.529 --> 31:46.947
I mean, I don't understand it.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.074
All I know is that
if I didn't check the burners

31:49.158 --> 31:50.534
three times a night,

31:50.618 --> 31:52.745
Soldier Boy would come back
and kill the rest of us.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.666
And I'm still that kid.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.087
Still getting up
in the middle of the night,

32:02.171 --> 32:05.132
checking the burners.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.926
'Cause if I don't,

32:08.010 --> 32:11.472
Soldier Boy's gonna come back,

32:11.555 --> 32:13.807
and he's gonna kill my family.

32:17.978 --> 32:22.358
I got to get this motherfucker
out of my head,

32:22.441 --> 32:25.277
and end this.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.571
Or it'll end me.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.961
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, hell nah.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.089
- [Starlight] Oh, my God.
- Invitation?

32:45.172 --> 32:46.548
I got your invitation
right here.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.050
Hey.

32:48.133 --> 32:51.220
Starlight. I did not
even recognize you.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.931
Come in. You are
more than welcome to party.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.265
- Party?
- [Love Sausage] Yeah.

32:55.349 --> 32:57.726
The 70th anniversary
of Herogasm.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.561
- Fuck me.
- Oh.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.106
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.273
You seem familiar.

33:03.357 --> 33:05.317
You about to get familiar
with these hands

33:05.401 --> 33:07.486
if you don't get this
motherfucking love sausage

33:07.569 --> 33:09.238
away from my goddamn face.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.072
Okay, okay, okay.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.700
You are not Supe.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.368
I'm with her.

33:14.451 --> 33:15.911
For the fuck party.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.956
Yeah. Um, mm-hmm.
No, he's very good

33:19.039 --> 33:20.624
at cunnilingus.
Yeah, his tongue

33:20.708 --> 33:21.917
- is just... Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.211
He just gobbles
that vagina right up.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.879
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom. [chuckles]

33:25.963 --> 33:28.340
- Mm-hmm.
- Love Sausage, huh?

33:28.424 --> 33:29.967
This is good name for me.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.720
I like it. Come on in.

33:34.471 --> 33:36.473
[moaning]

33:41.437 --> 33:43.689
Oh, my God.

33:48.277 --> 33:50.112
Oh...

33:50.195 --> 33:53.282
All right, so once a year,
a bunch of C-listers

33:53.365 --> 33:55.075
get together
at one of their places

33:55.159 --> 33:56.952
- to get they wicks wet.
- [moaning]

33:57.035 --> 33:57.828
- [grunts]
- Stop.

33:57.911 --> 33:59.288
- Herogasm.
- Mm-hmm.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.999
- I get it.
- Holy ass-ramming.

34:02.082 --> 34:03.167
Ew.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.251
Aw, stop!

34:04.334 --> 34:06.628
Holy ass-ramming.
Holy ass-ramming.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.133
- [screams]
- [moaning]

34:11.216 --> 34:14.595
[female Supe] Come on.
Come on my hump.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.054
That's it.

34:16.138 --> 34:17.931
- [grunting]
- [electricity buzzing]

34:18.015 --> 34:20.100
Poor Frenchie.

34:20.184 --> 34:23.061
He's always wanted to see this.
He's gonna be heartbroken.

34:27.024 --> 34:29.151
[Mother's Milk] You know
what's fucked up?

34:29.234 --> 34:30.444
- Hmm?
- [Mother's Milk] It's that it's

34:30.527 --> 34:31.862
real fucking sex workers here

34:31.945 --> 34:34.490
getting banged up,
and not in the good way.

34:34.573 --> 34:35.783
[screams]

34:35.866 --> 34:37.409
[Mother's Milk] Not that
these Supes give a shit.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.411
When Soldier Boy gets here,

34:39.495 --> 34:40.871
it's gonna be a slaughter.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.081
We have to get these people out.

34:45.209 --> 34:47.002
What up, bro?

34:47.085 --> 34:49.213
What the fuck
did this motherfucker

34:49.296 --> 34:50.923
- put on my jacket?
- Oh, my God. Okay. Um...

34:51.006 --> 34:52.341
It's my favorite fucking jacket.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.842
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- Some nasty-ass shit.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.469
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- This shit is sticky.

34:55.552 --> 34:56.929
Let's go clean it up. Let's go.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.847
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Yellowtail sashimi?

34:58.931 --> 35:01.892
No. No, not in the mood
for that. Thanks.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.435
- Goddamn it.
- [male Supe] Throwing ropes.

35:04.728 --> 35:05.604
[gasps, screams]

35:05.687 --> 35:06.897
[male Supe] Oh, shit.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.817
Lick it up,
you yummy brown bear.

35:09.900 --> 35:10.984
[door closes]
