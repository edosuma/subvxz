WEBVTT

00:56.682 --> 00:57.683
Morning.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.705
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.082
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.919
- Got it. Thank you.
- That's very dangerous, sir.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.422
I've seen that arm
almost cut someone in half.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.007
Yes. I'm sorry.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.508
Thank you for stopping.

01:31.592 --> 01:36.346
And thank you for… your service.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.299
Sorry. I didn't know you were in here.
I'll come back.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.718
No. You don't have to leave.
No, I'm-- You can--

02:56.802 --> 02:58.512
I mean, I'll be done in a second.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.022
These machines, huh?

03:09.898 --> 03:10.899
Yeah.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.150
Tell me about it.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.862
Technology.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.753
Do you know that
the Spanish word for coffee is <i>el café</i>?

03:33.172 --> 03:35.299
Yeah. I mean, I fig--

03:35.382 --> 03:37.759
Yeah, I guess I heard that somewhere.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.768
I mean,
maybe the coffee machine needs coffee.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.522
What do you mean?

03:53.483 --> 03:55.652
- You know what? I'm just gonna…
- Yeah, or I can-- Yep.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.739
No, I got it. I'm good.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.409
Okay. Enjoy.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.911
Yep.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.666
I'm sorry, Sofia. I asked Rhonda
to double-check everything.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.751
Which was a mistake.

04:10.834 --> 04:14.171
I'm not a close reader.
I'm more of a dancer and artist.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.964
I asked you both to stay on top of this.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.052
I should be fired. I deserve it.

04:20.135 --> 04:23.722
I can move back to Connecticut
and marry Trevor. It's fine.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.891
Maybe he'll get less stupid
as time goes on.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.810
Wait. No one is getting fired.
What's going on here?

04:28.894 --> 04:30.062
What's going on here is

04:30.145 --> 04:33.148
that we just gave a lot of your money
to Alameda Community College,

04:33.232 --> 04:37.819
but 40% went to executive salaries,
not to the students who need it.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.530
We missed it in the contract.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.991
Sofia, were you wearing that yesterday?

04:43.534 --> 04:44.701
Did you sleep here?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.663
I was here all night,
but I definitely didn't sleep,

04:47.746 --> 04:51.416
because I have no support,
and I have to do everything myself.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.087
Okay. Look,
it's obvious we all need a break, okay?

04:55.170 --> 04:57.673
Everyone, gather up your stuff.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.883
We are going to take a mental health day.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.804
What? No. We can't just leave.
This is work, and we're Americans.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.432
She's right. It's our national duty
to stay here and be miserable.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.226
That's ridiculous.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.105
Look, if there's one thing
that rich people know a great deal about,

05:13.188 --> 05:14.481
it's self-care.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.442
I once took six baths in one day

05:17.526 --> 05:19.194
in three different countries.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.362
I'm very proud of that.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.073
Sofia, throw some deodorant on.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.450
We're gonna ride together.
I'll see you in five.

05:30.956 --> 05:31.957
Oh, God.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.626
Okay, he's got kind eyes.
What about that guy?

05:34.710 --> 05:36.670
He's wearing a hat in, like, every photo.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.714
He's probably bald or worse.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.507
We got no time for hat-fishers.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.592
Next.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.469
And another gay guy with a niece.
How original.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.097
You didn't do any of the work.
Your sister did.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.933
What about that guy you've been talking to
for, like, three weeks?

05:50.017 --> 05:51.852
He's cute, but he's a little clingy.

05:51.935 --> 05:55.397
I mean, last week he left me a voice mail.
And it's like, "What?"

05:55.480 --> 05:58.609
You mind if I give you some advice
as a guy who's been happily pre-engaged

05:58.692 --> 05:59.735
- for eight years?
- Okay.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.237
You gotta figure out
why you're even on these apps.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.323
Is it about the guy or the game?

06:04.406 --> 06:07.201
'Cause you're not gonna meet someone real
if it's about the game.

06:07.743 --> 06:08.577
Yeah.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.662
What time is it anyway? I'm starving.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.456
Man, there's no bosses here.
Let's just go.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.082
- Yeah.
- Hey.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.084
Would you gentlemen like a third?

06:18.295 --> 06:19.338
A third what?

06:20.005 --> 06:22.382
It's just-- I wanna-- I was--

06:22.466 --> 06:24.468
Can-- Well, can I come with you?

06:26.720 --> 06:31.141
I guess. I mean, don't you normally go to
the park with your sad little lunch box?

06:31.225 --> 06:35.812
I do. I was just thinking
today I would hang with the boys.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.565
All right. Fine.

06:38.649 --> 06:41.610
Just please follow our lead
conversation-wise.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.613
Where you lead, I shall follow, Captain.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.825
Okay, you tell me
if you feel that was a good start.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.381
Molly.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.882
Greta.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.592
Welcome back.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.929
- And welcome home.
- Thank you.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.639
Okay. I am not joining your cult.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.057
I'll join.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.352
This is not a cult. This is Halsa.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.229
It's my favorite spa in all of LA.

07:17.312 --> 07:20.691
I've read about this place. Their
membership wait list is five years long.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.651
Yes, but we got in right away.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.903
Okay, how long is this all going to take?

07:24.987 --> 07:27.823
Who knows? Time has no meaning here.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.074
She's right, of course.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.785
This is a haven
from the rest of the world.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.246
Although we do actually need
an updated credit card from you.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.415
Yes, of course.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.333
I have to get back
to the office soon, and I--

07:38.417 --> 07:41.295
Sofia, relax. This is why we're here.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.797
You are under way too much stress.

07:43.881 --> 07:47.885
We are here to forget about our problems
and have a great time.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.679
Breathe in these calming essential oils.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.100
Okay. I can see why people do this.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.728
It feels like
I'm on the <i>Avatar</i> planet right now.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.438
That means she likes it.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.064
That feels amazing. What is this?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.735
Just like Waikiki.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.403
No. It's not.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.030
You're not gonna believe this,

08:08.113 --> 08:10.365
but this place makes
an incredible grilled cheese.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.450
Best in the city.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.577
We will not be needing those.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.205
- Three grilled cheese sandwiches, please.
- Okay, sure.

08:16.288 --> 08:19.124
And I'm gonna order a beer.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.751
You guys want a beer?

08:23.003 --> 08:25.005
Okay, weirdo. What's going on?
What's wrong with you?

08:25.088 --> 08:27.341
- Are you dying?
- No. Nothing is wrong.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.886
It's just--
Hey, our bosses are out of the office.

08:30.969 --> 08:35.390
What's wrong with having a little fun?
Having some beers with my two <i>compadres</i>?

08:36.433 --> 08:39.686
Okay. The vibe is so weird right now.

08:39.770 --> 08:40.770
I haven't felt this way

08:40.854 --> 08:43.398
since my parents told me
they were getting divorced again.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.150
Let's get those beers so we can calm down.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.361
Great. Yes, three beers.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.155
Something like a Amstel Light,
but less exotic.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.698
Okay. I'll see what we have.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.534
That did not help me relax.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.377
I can feel myself detoxifying.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.337
I had half a glass
of white wine last night,

09:05.420 --> 09:08.048
and this mask
is totally getting rid of my hangover.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.258
What's in it?

09:09.341 --> 09:10.759
Aloe, collagen,

09:10.843 --> 09:14.096
and some 2,000-year-old volcanic soil
from Pompeii.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.722
Obviously, that was a tragedy,

09:15.806 --> 09:17.724
but it's cool
something good could come from it.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.937
Oh, my God. I can't believe this is
how wide my jaw is supposed to open.

09:22.855 --> 09:25.190
It looks like
you're finally understanding self-care.

09:27.276 --> 09:28.694
You know what? I think I am.

09:29.778 --> 09:33.323
Ainsley, Rhonda,
I wanna apologize for this morning.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.493
I shouldn't have come at you like that.
I was obviously stressed and tired.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.538
You weren't terribly wrong.
We did mess up.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.665
Everyone messes up sometimes.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.917
Most days, you two do really good work.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.086
I just wanna let you know that.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.296
Thank you, dear.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.631
Thank you for taking us here, Molly.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.551
This was a really good idea.
I think the team needed this.

09:52.634 --> 09:53.844
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.305
You guys. Don't worry about it.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.598
Anytime.

10:00.142 --> 10:03.729
<i>I'll be there for you</i>

10:03.812 --> 10:06.356
-<i>When the rain starts--</i>
- We're not gonna sing, Ainsley.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.816
Okay. Got it. Yep.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.570
Okay. Howard, this is
a horrible grilled cheese sandwich.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.155
Okay, I'm remembering now.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.199
This is not
the grilled cheese sandwich place.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.826
This is the place
where Tanya and I got bad food poisoning.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.704
She really embarrassed me that night.

10:22.164 --> 10:26.960
Yeah, going to dinner
with a special someone can be so nice.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.170
What are you talking about?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.839
Something is definitely going on.
Just tell us what's bothering you.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.133
I mean, it's nothing major.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.719
It's just, when you get to my age,

10:35.802 --> 10:40.057
you start to realize that the end
is closer than the beginning.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.976
- Wow. That's where you're starting?
- No, I get it.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.647
I mean, I'm always worried I'm gonna die
before the <i>Fast and the Furious</i> saga ends,

10:46.730 --> 10:48.774
and I gotta know
if <i>la familia</i> sticks together.

10:49.691 --> 10:53.237
I'm realizing
that I have reached a point in my life

10:53.320 --> 10:56.073
where I want some companionship again.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.701
I heard you guys talking about dating,
so I thought I would ask…

11:00.786 --> 11:02.371
if you had any advice.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.957
Okay.
Well, I really don't like vulnerability,

11:05.040 --> 11:08.418
but I love to tell people what to do,
which is basically what advice is.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.503
So, yeah, I'm in.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.421
Well, I'm in. I love helping people.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.924
I mean, I introduced my cousin J.J.
to his wife,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.635
and let's just say
I need to get it right this time.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.555
- Okay.
- So, show us your dating apps.

11:19.638 --> 11:22.266
Okay, I-- Yeah, I don't have any.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.935
What? Okay, give me your phone.
I'll download what you need.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.354
Great. Okay.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.523
All right.
So, we're gonna start with a bio.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.317
Something, you know, funny and sassy
but not too funny.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.402
And also keep it short,

11:33.485 --> 11:36.321
but sum up your entire life
in, like, nine words or less.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.284
Okay. Okay.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.910
I like…

11:41.994 --> 11:45.747
outside, daughter, love.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.043
- We're gonna handle the writing.
- Yep.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.422
Hey, Molly.
Is it okay if we keep these robes?

11:53.505 --> 11:55.048
I feel like
I'm being hugged by a polar bear.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.092
Yes, honey. Of course you can.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.511
Shut your beautiful face.

11:59.595 --> 12:02.472
- Moll-Doll? Hey!
- Molly!

12:02.556 --> 12:06.185
What are you doing here? I thought
you were gonna be at your work thingy now.

12:06.268 --> 12:10.439
Well, I decided to treat my coworkers
to a spa day.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.441
Oh, my God! Cute!

12:12.524 --> 12:13.817
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.944
It's so good to see you guys.
I've missed you.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.530
We haven't seen each other in so long.

12:19.198 --> 12:21.575
God, I know.
I've been slammed up the butt lately.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.827
Ever since we came back from Florence,
all hell broke loose.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.038
Like, "Life, can you give me a minute?"

12:26.997 --> 12:29.583
But we said when we get back to LA,
we have to call you.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.337
Wait. So, were you guys
in Florence together?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.839
Yeah, yeah. It was the annual wives' trip.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.132
Right! Oh, my gosh.

12:37.216 --> 12:39.134
Yes, of course, the annual wives' trip.

12:39.718 --> 12:43.096
I mean,
I'm not technically John's wife anymore,

12:43.180 --> 12:46.099
but that doesn't mean
that you guys can't go,

12:46.183 --> 12:47.684
but, I mean, we're still friends,

12:47.768 --> 12:50.020
so why wouldn't we still
go on trips together?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.105
I mean… right?

12:54.149 --> 12:55.400
What? What is it?

12:56.026 --> 12:58.654
Honey, we just thought
it would be awkward for you.

12:58.737 --> 12:59.738
Yeah.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.073
What would be awkward?

13:02.199 --> 13:03.867
Wait, was Hailey on the trip?

13:05.244 --> 13:06.620
Well, I mean, she was on--

13:06.703 --> 13:07.871
She was on part of it.

13:09.790 --> 13:10.791
It was random.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.752
We were going to meet the boys
in Rome after,

13:13.836 --> 13:15.754
and John really wanted to bring Hailey.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.965
And Phil, I mean, I love him,

13:18.048 --> 13:20.384
but he's such a dumb fucking idiot.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.761
He told John that Hailey could go.

13:22.845 --> 13:26.849
So, it wasn't ideal,
but, you know, we kind of had to.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.476
- Right, right. Sure. I mean, I get it.
- Yeah.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.229
- I totally understand.
- Well, I mean, whatever.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.064
Let's get breakfast next week. Okay?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.274
- OG girls.
- Yes!

13:35.357 --> 13:37.609
- Sure.
- Okay, perfect.

13:37.693 --> 13:40.737
And by the way, I just have to say,

13:40.821 --> 13:43.448
I love your coworkers.

13:43.532 --> 13:46.994
I mean, what a diverse group.
I love that. Yes!

13:47.911 --> 13:50.455
Okay. I'm gonna call you next week,
whether you like it or not. Okay?

13:50.539 --> 13:51.373
- Yes.
- Love you.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.292
- Love you.
- You look amazing.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.877
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.756
Age?

13:59.840 --> 14:00.966
- Forty-five.
- Forty-one.

14:01.550 --> 14:02.926
- Height?
- 5'11".

14:03.010 --> 14:04.011
6'2".

14:04.094 --> 14:06.221
If you say you're 5'11",
that means you're actually 5'4".

14:07.055 --> 14:09.183
- Okay.
- Okay, favorite book?

14:09.266 --> 14:11.810
-<i>Jurassic Park</i>.
- Nope. I said "book." That's a movie.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.730
Okay. We're gonna leave that blank.
I think it's hotter that way.

14:14.813 --> 14:15.898
I can see that.

14:15.981 --> 14:19.276
All right, if you could invite one person
to dinner, who would it be?

14:22.070 --> 14:25.032
Okay. If the person spoke a dead language,

14:25.115 --> 14:26.950
would there be
some universal translator device?

14:27.034 --> 14:28.243
Oh, my God.

14:28.327 --> 14:31.663
LeBron, Oprah, Khaleesi, and you, babe.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.666
Jesus Christ, being straight is so easy.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.878
Yeah, I just feel like we're being
a little dishonest in this profile.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.047
What do you think dating is, dude?

14:40.130 --> 14:41.673
It's all about being dishonest.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.134
I mean, you lie online
and then again in person.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.677
I've been with Tanya for eight years,

14:45.761 --> 14:47.721
and she's still never seen me
with my shirt off.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.389
Do you want our help or not?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.226
Yes, I-- Yes.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.313
This is now my second-favorite place
after Disneyland.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.816
I hope I can come back here 479 times.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.818
Tida, you are an artist.

15:02.903 --> 15:06.114
Hey, Molly's been gone for a while.
Do you think she's all right?

15:06.198 --> 15:08.116
She said she was going to the bathroom.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.205
Tida, I'll be back in a second.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.670
Hi. Just a plain soda water, please.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.798
I will still take the umbrella,
if you have it.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.384
You sure you don't want a double?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.387
I'm just trying to keep hydrated.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.639
Yeah, I had a <i>cerveza</i> over there
with my friends, so…

15:30.722 --> 15:32.891
<i>Cerveza? Hablas español?</i>

15:33.809 --> 15:36.270
I'm sorry. I don't know Spanish.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.772
But I am learning.

15:38.856 --> 15:41.733
<i>Muy</i> early. I'm just on tape two.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.610
Well, your pronunciation's not bad.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.779
- What else you got?
- Okay.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.074
I can tell you about being at a zoo.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.665
Honestly, I can just list animals.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.042
Hey, it's a start.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.379
I'm Chelsea, by the way.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.256
Arthur. It's nice to meet you.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.340
You too.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.012
Thank you.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.722
Please. It is not a big deal.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.851
She threw my shit into a hot tub.
I saw her.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.645
- It was an accident.
- No, it was not an accident.

16:18.729 --> 16:22.399
Phil hitting that guy in Ireland
with his car, that was an accident.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.483
Okay, you know what?

16:23.567 --> 16:28.030
Maybe I did kick some of your stuff in,
but you deserved it.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.532
What were you doing,
going on a trip with Hailey?

16:30.616 --> 16:32.075
What kind of a friend does that?

16:32.159 --> 16:34.328
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

16:36.038 --> 16:38.498
That is-- That is unhinged.

16:40.959 --> 16:44.379
Molly, you know that
Halsa has a zero negative energy policy.

16:44.463 --> 16:46.548
I know that. Don't you think I know that?

16:46.632 --> 16:47.883
You need to say that to her.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.676
I think you know what I have to do.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.136
We've come to the end of the road here.

16:51.220 --> 16:54.598
I funded the entire aromatherapy wing.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.808
There is a scent named after me.

16:56.892 --> 17:00.020
It smells like plumeria
and blueberry muffins.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.316
I'm sorry, but I have to do this.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.819
We're gonna go ahead
and charge you for the rest of the month,

17:08.904 --> 17:10.614
but then rescind your membership.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.327
Fine.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.413
We should go.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.253
Perfect timing.
We just finished your profile.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.464
I added that you were a cast member
on <i>Road Rules, Semester at Sea</i>.

17:28.549 --> 17:29.758
Don't worry about it.

17:29.842 --> 17:32.135
I so appreciate
you gentlemen helping me with this,

17:32.219 --> 17:34.304
but I don't feel comfortable
with the lies.

17:34.388 --> 17:35.264
I'm gonna delete it.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.891
Oh, God.
Helping people is such a waste of time!

17:38.475 --> 17:40.936
- You work at a charity.
- Not by choice.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.521
It was great to meet you, Arthur.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.607
I'm free next week for dinner.
Text me anytime.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.568
Okay, great. Take care, Chelsea.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.656
Who the hell was that?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.533
Just a woman I met at the bar.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.035
We hit it off, so I asked her out.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.246
- IRL?
- I'm sorry, IR what?

17:59.329 --> 18:01.373
Wow. That is very old-school.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.041
I am impressed. Shook, but impressed.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.960
Okay, this calls for another round.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.628
Three more beers, please!

18:06.712 --> 18:08.547
And I'll take another bad grilled cheese!

18:08.630 --> 18:10.424
No. Your butt.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.261
Guys, I just want to say I'm sorry

18:14.344 --> 18:17.723
for having a full-on mental breakdown
during our mental health day.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.309
It's okay. Don't be too hard on yourself.

18:20.392 --> 18:23.395
- I ruined Halsa for you guys.
- No, you didn't.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.647
I like that I have one soft foot
and one crusty one now.

18:25.731 --> 18:27.107
It makes me interesting.

18:27.191 --> 18:29.318
You know, the messed-up thing is,

18:30.027 --> 18:32.321
I don't even really like Jacinda
that much.

18:32.404 --> 18:36.992
She was just a part of John's life,
and I think I just got used to her.

18:37.075 --> 18:40.495
And now he's gone,
and my old friends are gone.

18:40.579 --> 18:41.580
Halsa's gone.

18:42.581 --> 18:46.084
I just feel like an outdated model
of a car or something.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.629
No, you are not an outdated model.

18:48.712 --> 18:52.633
When I look at you,
I see a new and improved model.

18:52.716 --> 18:58.180
Yes. You're like a sleek, beautiful Buick.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.307
Okay. That's a weird car to pick,
but I agree.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.808
You have so much going for yourself.

19:01.892 --> 19:03.644
- And you're just getting started.
- That's right.

19:04.645 --> 19:05.646
Thanks.

19:06.438 --> 19:08.482
You'll have new friends, a new spa.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.275
- You'll get a new guy too. I know it.
- Yes.

19:10.359 --> 19:11.443
I don't know.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.362
I think my dating days are behind me.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.697
What? No, don't say that.

19:15.781 --> 19:18.700
You are beautiful.
You must have a ton of men after you.

19:18.784 --> 19:19.785
Maybe.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.871
Malcolm Gladwell keeps texting me
<i>New Yorker</i> articles and saying,

19:22.955 --> 19:24.414
"This made me think of you."

19:24.498 --> 19:28.377
And then I text back exclamation points,
but I don't read the article.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.255
- Is that flirting?
- No, definitely not. That's nothing.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.550
Forget him.
There's tons of nice guys out there.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.552
You'll meet one
when you're not even expecting it,

19:36.635 --> 19:38.011
and everything will just click.

19:40.013 --> 19:43.100
You're right. I think. Maybe.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.434
What do you say we drink up?

19:44.518 --> 19:46.478
- Yes!
- Yes! <i>Arriba!</i>

19:55.737 --> 19:56.738
Hello?

19:56.822 --> 19:59.783
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.785
Howard, Nicholas.

20:01.869 --> 20:05.914
They have returned
from the place that they were at.

20:05.998 --> 20:08.917
The boss bitches are back, respectfully.

20:09.001 --> 20:10.210
Shit.

20:10.294 --> 20:12.129
Are you guys drunk?

20:12.212 --> 20:16.383
We had some alcohol at lunch.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.261
I'm sorry. I never do stuff like this.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.180
No, it's okay.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.056
Us girls went and got a drink too.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.602
We saw the craziest thing.
We had to celebrate.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.270
This maverick right here,

20:28.353 --> 20:30.856
he asked out a girl
who was sitting at the bar.

20:30.939 --> 20:34.067
- IRL?
- Yeah, and she was beautiful too.

20:34.151 --> 20:38.155
Or, I'm sorry, <i>muy caliente</i>.
I can say that 'cause I'm gay.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.658
- No, you can't.
- But the alliance!

20:42.242 --> 20:43.368
Wow, that's cool.

20:43.952 --> 20:44.870
No, that's…

20:46.580 --> 20:49.291
I'm so happy for you. Proud of you.
Great job.

20:49.374 --> 20:50.375
Thanks.

20:52.794 --> 20:53.962
Okay.

20:54.046 --> 20:57.382
Okay, why don't we all just go home,
since everyone's drunk?

20:57.466 --> 20:58.759
See everyone tomorrow.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.511
And terrible day.

21:00.594 --> 21:03.180
Let's not do this again.
We're supposed to be professionals.

21:04.932 --> 21:05.933
Good night, guys.
