"There is sometimes a fine line
between a cop and a criminal."

00:08.442 --> 00:10.821
"What drives their personality
may be the same,"

00:10.941 --> 00:13.238
"and they have simply chosen
different roles"

00:13.358 --> 00:15.667
"and professions to call their own."

00:32.400 --> 00:34.875
- Where are we going?
- Calgary.

00:44.483 --> 00:45.625
Fuck.

01:20.442 --> 01:21.917
Stay in the car.

02:06.233 --> 02:09.375
- I need a wee wee.
- Can you hold it?

02:12.108 --> 02:14.572
- I'm gonna pee my pants!
- Dad, Petey needs the loo.

02:14.692 --> 02:16.708
Not now love, alright.

02:20.024 --> 02:24.250
- I need a wee wee.
- Not now pal, sorry.

02:24.859 --> 02:27.405
He's 5 years old.
30 seconds for a piss behind the car.

02:27.525 --> 02:29.155
- I need a wee wee.
- I said no!

02:29.275 --> 02:32.904
- Dad!
- I'm gonna pee my pants!

02:33.024 --> 02:36.113
Hang on. 30 seconds.

02:36.233 --> 02:37.584
Dad!

02:53.650 --> 02:59.208
TIN STAR

03:10.024 --> 03:12.489
Alright then.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.667
If you're up there.

03:16.358 --> 03:20.208
Keep me sober today. I dare you.

03:33.025 --> 03:35.417
Amen.

03:50.234 --> 03:51.792
Fuck off.

04:08.692 --> 04:10.917
Mornin'.

04:11.275 --> 04:14.500
Morning, dad.

04:15.941 --> 04:18.333
Do you want pancakes?

04:20.733 --> 04:23.166
What do you want on them?

04:23.608 --> 04:27.447
- Bacon and chocolate.
- All right.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.917
I'll put some cabbage
on them all!

04:35.025 --> 04:38.030
- That was exhausting.
- I know. I won!

04:38.150 --> 04:42.530
You did win. Most definitely.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.864
Pete? Pete!

04:45.984 --> 04:50.031
You want chocolate
or lemon and sugar?

04:50.151 --> 04:53.166
- Bacon and chocolate?
- Dad?

04:54.191 --> 04:56.125
- What...
- Dad?

04:57.108 --> 05:01.708
- Dad!
- What!

05:03.333 --> 05:05.753
Why can't you answer me?

05:05.873 --> 05:09.295
Why can't you exercise the common
courtesy of entering

05:09.415 --> 05:13.390
the same vague arrondissement
as the person you're shouting at?

05:13.790 --> 05:15.753
- What are you on about?
- What are you wearing?

05:15.873 --> 05:18.128
- It's just my pyjamas.
- Are you wearing those to school?

05:18.248 --> 05:20.628
- Of course not.
- You don't drink coffee...

05:20.748 --> 05:22.891
Go away!

05:36.123 --> 05:37.641
I hate it here?

05:38.207 --> 05:41.295
For God's sake don't tell your father.
He thinks he's Pat Garrett.

05:41.415 --> 05:44.223
- This isn't his fault.
- It's not anybody's fault.

05:44.457 --> 05:46.557
Coming here was your idea.

05:47.580 --> 05:51.544
Hello, little man. Come here to me...

05:51.664 --> 05:52.711
Have a bit of that.

05:52.831 --> 05:56.170
How many pancakes did you eat?
Happy birthday.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.128
- Thank you.
- Dad's birthday's in December.

05:58.248 --> 06:01.140
- His sober birthday.
- I'm two.

06:01.581 --> 06:05.681
I'm proud of you.
You're not that man anymore.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.962
- Get out of here.
- Where's my gun?

06:16.082 --> 06:17.681
In your pocket!

06:55.956 --> 06:58.473
Fuck me.

07:05.540 --> 07:07.920
Shall I honk the horn?

07:08.040 --> 07:11.890
- These things charge though, right?
- It's not a moose, dad.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.836
Shouldn't you have a proper car?

07:15.956 --> 07:19.671
This is a properly green community.
It's one of the things I love about it.

07:19.791 --> 07:21.836
I'm growing up in the
ass-end of nowhere.

07:21.956 --> 07:25.253
- You said ass.
- She did but she shouldn't have.

07:25.373 --> 07:30.045
- Why can't we go back to London?
- Cause London's shit.

07:30.165 --> 07:33.253
We'd probably be living in some suburb.
Like Hainault.

07:33.373 --> 07:35.962
Is that what you want? You want to live
in Rayner's fucking Lane do you?

07:36.082 --> 07:38.390
- You said fuck.
- I know I did but I shouldn't have.

07:39.207 --> 07:41.796
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not a snow boarder...

07:41.916 --> 07:44.753
I cannot think of anything
more pointless than hiking.

07:44.873 --> 07:49.003
And I'm not a middle-aged man who likes
midge-infested rivers and fly-fishing.

07:49.123 --> 07:51.629
I don't want to squander
my youth here!

07:51.749 --> 07:56.599
Marry a lumberjack! Have kids
and sell jam at the county fair!

07:57.457 --> 08:01.003
I want to be like a photojournalist.

08:01.123 --> 08:06.557
Or an archeologist.
Or an agent for change.

08:06.963 --> 08:09.188
Fuckin' ell.

08:10.630 --> 08:13.301
It seems like five minutes ago you
wanted a tutu and pair of pink jeggings.

08:13.421 --> 08:15.522
Humor is an avoidance strategy.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.093
- Drive slowly.
- Yep.

08:18.213 --> 08:20.177
And it may handle like a golf cart
but it is a cop car.

08:20.297 --> 08:23.397
- Yep.
- And you shouldn't be driving it.

08:49.464 --> 08:52.552
Do you know how many police
move here from home?

08:52.672 --> 08:54.261
- No.
- Loads.

08:54.381 --> 08:56.635
- So?
- So, look around you.

08:56.755 --> 08:59.052
- It's paradise, right?
- It's the most boring place on earth.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.427
- Its good bring though in it.
- I miss my friends.

09:01.547 --> 09:04.147
- You don't have any friends.
- I had friends. In London.

09:04.756 --> 09:08.104
- I was happy there.
- Give it a chance love.

09:08.224 --> 09:10.867
Alright let's go. Bye. Let's go.

09:11.391 --> 09:14.075
Bye!

09:19.308 --> 09:21.533
Mornin', Chief!

09:33.933 --> 09:36.200
- Chief...
- All right.

09:36.975 --> 09:40.616
- How you doing?
- Hi there, Chief!

10:14.350 --> 10:15.772
Anything to report?

10:15.892 --> 10:19.022
Tourist sprained her ankle
on the trail by Forty Mile Creek.

10:19.142 --> 10:21.534
- That it?
- Yep.

10:23.350 --> 10:26.283
- That's what I love about this place.
- She was running from a grizzly.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.606
- Fuck me. She alright?
- Yeah, mum and cub.

10:29.726 --> 10:31.616
Lady musta missed the signs.
No one was attacked.

10:32.140 --> 10:34.772
- Shouldn't we do something?
- We put signs up.

10:34.892 --> 10:37.189
No. I mean like shoot it?

10:37.309 --> 10:41.658
We don't just shoot bears, Chief, not
unless they make an unprovoked attack.

10:44.224 --> 10:46.450
Feet.

10:47.266 --> 10:48.939
Sorry.

10:49.059 --> 10:52.491
I'll let you know if anything else
happens. You can always go fishing.

10:55.140 --> 10:57.438
- Fishing?
- It's what the last police chief did.

10:57.558 --> 11:01.993
He left his fishing stuff over there
before he passed. You can help yourself.

11:02.516 --> 11:03.688
He wasn't killed by a bear, was he?

11:03.808 --> 11:06.366
No, he was dead from exposure
by the time the bears got to him.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.118
- That's a joke. He's joking, right?
- Yeah, he's joking.

11:10.273 --> 11:13.248
Council couldn't afford him.

11:15.690 --> 11:17.737
I'm not going anywhere.

11:17.857 --> 11:19.653
- Chief?
- Yep?

11:19.773 --> 11:22.206
Be careful out there.

11:25.732 --> 11:27.916
Top left.

11:34.148 --> 11:38.164
No... Bugger!

12:19.441 --> 12:24.153
I'm Angela Worth. I'm the new police
chief's wife. How do you do?

12:24.273 --> 12:28.612
Do you fancy some burned fudge?

12:28.732 --> 12:30.291
Or would you prefer a fist fuck?

12:31.023 --> 12:35.779
Happy birthday to you.

12:35.899 --> 12:40.665
Happy birthday dear Jim...

12:41.440 --> 12:46.290
Happy birthday to you.

12:47.273 --> 12:50.081
Keep coming back...

12:57.024 --> 13:00.986
Jim. Alcoholic. Addict.

13:01.106 --> 13:02.653
Hi, Jim!

13:02.773 --> 13:07.081
Two years sober today.
Fuck knows how.

13:11.190 --> 13:15.860
I know I'm supposed to say something
to a Higher Power,

13:15.980 --> 13:18.737
but bollocks to all that.

13:18.857 --> 13:22.248
But thank to Father Greg for cake.

13:23.940 --> 13:25.790
Suzy.

13:27.649 --> 13:31.195
So I don't normally
talk at the meetings

13:31.315 --> 13:35.748
usually hiding at the back,
but here goes...

13:36.231 --> 13:38.081
What can I tell you
about being a drunk?

13:42.231 --> 13:45.248
I was born frightened, I think.

13:46.899 --> 13:50.582
I grew up frightened. And...

13:52.356 --> 13:58.070
Drinking took the fear away.
But also it took everything else away.

13:58.190 --> 14:02.528
I didn't care about you.
I didn't care about me.

14:02.648 --> 14:06.862
I didn't care about my family,
didn't care about anything.

14:06.982 --> 14:10.040
Expect getting what I wanted.

14:13.523 --> 14:16.541
And if you got in the way of that...

14:17.607 --> 14:19.749
I'd kill you.

14:42.023 --> 14:43.541
Thanks for trying.

14:44.774 --> 14:48.666
- May I?
- Be my guest.

14:53.064 --> 14:55.623
- This is good.
- It's not. It's horrible.

14:55.941 --> 14:59.737
- Butterscotch?
- Fudge. Buggered fudge.

14:59.857 --> 15:03.583
- English?
- Irish. My husband's English.

15:04.232 --> 15:07.290
- Come to check up on the colonies?
- We live here.

15:08.273 --> 15:09.860
For God's sake,
don't attempt to chew.

15:09.980 --> 15:14.248
- Stop! How many have you sold?
- None.

15:15.224 --> 15:19.063
- How much for the whole lot?
- The whole lot?

15:19.183 --> 15:24.033
- It's for a good cause, isn't it?
- No, that's awfully kind of you, but...

15:25.017 --> 15:27.743
I just bought ten jars of apple sauce
at the last stall.

15:28.018 --> 15:29.700
Fudge'll make a nice gift.

15:30.643 --> 15:33.908
You're the new police chief's wife,
aren't you?

15:35.141 --> 15:39.533
If I were you I'd want to be
a sellout success at the church fete.

15:40.433 --> 15:43.396
Sorry. Who are you?

15:43.516 --> 15:44.855
Truth is, I'm here for work

15:44.975 --> 15:47.188
and my children are across the country
with their father,

15:47.308 --> 15:50.230
who's an asshole,
which makes it worse.

15:50.350 --> 15:54.563
So I thought maybe that whole entire
tray of homemade buggered fudge

15:54.683 --> 15:57.450
might make that horrendous hotel
feel less like The Shining.

15:58.183 --> 16:01.104
Why didn't you say so? Here.

16:01.224 --> 16:03.783
Knock yourself out
and your teeth.

16:03.975 --> 16:07.533
- Welcome to Little Big Bear.
- Elizabeth Bradshaw.

16:07.850 --> 16:10.522
- Angela.
- Thank you. Angela.

16:10.642 --> 16:13.076
- You're welcome.
- Cheerio.

16:33.725 --> 16:37.021
Who wants a healthier future for our
children and a stronger economy?

16:37.141 --> 16:40.648
We all do... Through Northstream Oil
sands innovation initiative...

16:40.768 --> 16:42.940
Come see how we're innovating
for a cleaner future

16:43.060 --> 16:46.647
at www.carbonsafestorage.com

16:46.767 --> 16:50.742
Northstream Oil cares.

16:51.351 --> 16:55.438
You think I'm paid to say that? I am.

16:55.558 --> 17:00.743
You think I'd lie for a lousy paycheck?
I wouldn't.

17:01.433 --> 17:05.771
As V.P. of Stakeholder Relations,
I came to Little Big Bear to hear you.

17:05.892 --> 17:09.742
To hear your questions.
Your hopes. Your fears.

17:09.893 --> 17:13.063
Because, ultimately this is your town.

17:13.183 --> 17:15.904
Your valley. And your decision.

17:16.023 --> 17:19.083
Bullshit. They started building
that damn thing months ago.

17:19.650 --> 17:23.571
Northstream Oil wants to build
a refinery in the middle of nowhere

17:23.692 --> 17:27.031
because it's too big a health risk
to put next to a major city.

17:27.151 --> 17:31.155
Northstream Oil chose this site
because it's the perfect nexus

17:31.275 --> 17:33.821
for oil sands petroleum into the US.

17:33.941 --> 17:37.488
And our safety standards
far exceed the legal requirements.

17:37.608 --> 17:39.833
What about crime?

17:41.733 --> 17:45.530
The chief is right. It's happened in
Fort McMurray and Grand Prairie.

17:45.650 --> 17:50.238
Migrant oil workers from all the world
pouring into little towns like ours

17:50.358 --> 17:54.030
after long, backbreaking shifts looking
for somewhere to spend their cash.

17:54.150 --> 17:55.917
My bar, for starters!

17:56.483 --> 17:59.280
My paint's peeling
and my mortgage is hurting!

17:59.400 --> 18:03.071
So, you guys want to keep your local
watering hole? I need more customers.

18:03.191 --> 18:07.114
They're not gonna stop
at a few beers and a game of pool.

18:07.234 --> 18:12.000
They are young men with no education,
away from their wives and families...

18:13.400 --> 18:15.904
What does the police chief think?

18:16.024 --> 18:18.196
You've worked big cities,
surely you can't be worried?

18:18.316 --> 18:22.406
I'm new here. I was just concerned.

18:22.526 --> 18:24.500
Afraid of a little crime, Chief?

18:25.066 --> 18:28.416
Or are you better at catching trout
than crooks?

18:29.692 --> 18:34.698
Alright then... If you want my opinion,
I think it's a shit idea.

18:34.818 --> 18:36.166
If it was up to me, I'd say no.

18:37.941 --> 18:43.530
It isn't. Police chief's job's not
to interfere in decisions like this.

18:43.650 --> 18:45.489
God dammit, you just rolled in here.

18:45.609 --> 18:47.375
You weren't born here,
you weren't raised here,

18:47.733 --> 18:51.583
- You haven't got the right.
- Me, I've got no rights at all.

18:51.941 --> 18:53.821
I'm just here to protect you.

18:53.941 --> 18:57.530
This town relies almost entirely

18:57.650 --> 19:00.124
on a modest tourist industry,
doesn't it?

19:00.734 --> 19:04.697
So if you're so keen on protecting it
why is there a tourist in the hospital

19:04.817 --> 19:08.708
and a grizzly bear on the loose
while you were out fishing all day?

19:09.316 --> 19:11.655
Seems to me the chief should be
out there shooting bears,

19:11.775 --> 19:14.708
not in here shooting his mouth off!

19:24.108 --> 19:28.375
- How'd I do?
- This always goes the same way.

19:28.775 --> 19:32.322
If someone won't sign over
their land for company access,

19:32.442 --> 19:34.780
we just build our roads
on their neighbor's property.

19:34.900 --> 19:40.447
Then they get all the tanker noise and
traffic fumes and none of the cash.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.447
What about the rancher Lyle?

19:42.567 --> 19:45.375
Comes from an oil family
so he'll know industry tactics.

19:45.526 --> 19:47.363
Then there's the doctor
with the chip on her shoulder,

19:47.483 --> 19:49.875
the police chief with
something to prove.

19:50.358 --> 19:54.876
You're here to get a bunch
of boxes ticked.

19:56.150 --> 19:58.625
Don't make things complicated.

20:36.692 --> 20:39.196
- Care to fill me in?
- I'm taking responsible social action.

20:39.316 --> 20:42.155
Right. You've got a dead duck
in a plastic bag.

20:42.275 --> 20:45.071
- They're poisoning our river!
- I know, it's 'our' river now, is it?

20:45.191 --> 20:46.739
And the only reason
the principal bollocked me

20:46.859 --> 20:48.655
for bringing a dead duck
into biology class

20:48.775 --> 20:51.655
is because Northstream Oil
just donated money to the school.

20:51.775 --> 20:52.946
Really?

20:53.066 --> 20:56.708
- Anna.
- Is this going to happen to us?

21:05.775 --> 21:06.864
What did Bradshaw say?

21:06.984 --> 21:09.447
She said it had probably flown
through a wind farm.

21:09.567 --> 21:12.071
How'd you know it didn't die
of bird flu?

21:12.191 --> 21:15.416
I don't know what it died of. Yet.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.167
- Put your belt on.
- Alright.

21:28.526 --> 21:30.334
Fuck me.

21:55.817 --> 21:59.572
- Excuse me, Mrs...
- Bradshaw.

21:59.692 --> 22:04.071
Mrs. Bradshaw. Could you get
your truck off my road?

22:04.191 --> 22:08.625
Your road? The Municipal District's
road and we have full use.

22:09.024 --> 22:11.196
Far point.

22:11.316 --> 22:15.625
But, next time, what if it squashes
a school bus or something?

22:19.525 --> 22:22.250
How you doing Dani alright?

22:27.608 --> 22:29.281
What's all this then?

22:29.401 --> 22:33.084
Mr. Lyle and I are just having
a private meeting.

22:33.859 --> 22:36.083
Squidge up.

22:38.067 --> 22:41.917
She trying to get your signature
on something?

22:42.650 --> 22:44.375
Maybe.

22:46.692 --> 22:50.084
- Have you got a lawyer, mate?
- I dunno...

22:54.191 --> 22:58.625
This man's in no fit state
to be signing any legal contracts.

22:58.859 --> 23:00.822
- What do you take me for?
- I'm not taking you for anything, love.

23:00.942 --> 23:02.584
Who's in no fit state?

23:03.609 --> 23:05.655
- Mrs...
- Bradshaw.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.208
Mrs. Bradshaw

23:09.150 --> 23:11.447
is trying to get your brother
to sign some sort of deal.

23:11.567 --> 23:14.959
Just leave him out of this
you understand me?

23:15.817 --> 23:17.704
Elizabeth and me were trying
to do a deal together.

23:17.824 --> 23:20.330
I go and take a piss,
I come back here and you crawled in.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.008
What business is this of yours?

23:22.283 --> 23:26.592
I do apologize, Mr. Lyle,
I didn't realize that you were here.

23:26.866 --> 23:31.592
I'll be in my office.
We can finish our deal there.

23:33.242 --> 23:34.621
You can buy yourself a dirt track

23:34.741 --> 23:38.455
but you can't stop me closing our road
to your traffic

23:38.575 --> 23:42.175
if it presents a health and safety
risk to the residents of this town...

23:42.950 --> 23:45.840
And their kids. Elizabeth.

23:47.367 --> 23:50.122
You may well have a personal opinion
on our use of the road.

23:50.242 --> 23:53.342
- But you're powerless to stop it.
- We'll see about that won't we.

23:54.659 --> 23:57.288
The police chief just knocked
twenty-five thousand dollars

23:57.408 --> 23:59.841
off the deal we offered you.

24:06.908 --> 24:09.050
Don't forget your duck!

24:11.741 --> 24:13.123
What was all that about?

24:13.243 --> 24:16.383
I took some socially
responsible action.

24:18.534 --> 24:22.080
- Get your hands in the air now!
- Really? Denise!

24:22.200 --> 24:25.996
- Get your hands in the air, Lyle, now!
- Okay. Put the gun away.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.913
If you don't arrest him, no one's
gonna respect your authority here.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.331
I'm British, Denise.
We don't do guns. Put the gun away.

24:30.451 --> 24:34.800
- Dad...
- Put the gun away!

24:39.908 --> 24:42.051
I think you and I we need
to have a quiet little talk.

24:42.617 --> 24:44.467
- Are you going to arrest me?
- Do I need to?

24:46.283 --> 24:50.091
- Up your ass you fat Limey.
- Knock it off Danny really...

24:53.740 --> 24:55.050
Jesus.

24:57.660 --> 25:01.372
- Fuck!
- Come on, here we go.

25:01.492 --> 25:04.760
Go on, you're on the side walk.

25:07.659 --> 25:11.592
Christ, you're not gonna puke,
are you?

25:18.617 --> 25:22.840
Nothing to see here.
You got a tissue, love?

25:26.033 --> 25:28.746
Now, oil workers, from Britain to B.C.,

25:28.866 --> 25:31.373
are gonna start
pouring into that facility,

25:31.493 --> 25:35.258
all of them, looking for the nearest
town to get fucked up in.

25:35.866 --> 25:39.008
And the nearest town is...

25:41.326 --> 25:46.134
- Sorry. How can I help you?
- How can I help you?

25:47.450 --> 25:50.330
- I'm not following this at all.
- Follow this.

25:50.450 --> 25:53.205
I'm Head of Security.

25:53.325 --> 25:57.704
Our workers will be subject
to a zero tolerance policy

25:57.824 --> 26:01.468
on drugs, alcohol, gambling,
prostitution and violence.

26:01.700 --> 26:05.801
Believe me we're watching them.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.634
But the reality is

26:09.284 --> 26:13.760
we're counting on your cooperation
to make sure things go smoothly.

26:14.283 --> 26:15.789
Smoothly for who?

26:15.909 --> 26:20.300
And your only hope
of keeping law and order

26:21.057 --> 26:24.603
is to cooperate fully
with Northstream Oil.

26:24.723 --> 26:27.061
- That's why we pay you.
- You don't pay me.

26:27.181 --> 26:30.157
- The council does.
- With our money.

26:32.015 --> 26:34.979
You know this, this shit-heel town

26:35.099 --> 26:39.573
couldn't afford a police chief
without us.

26:50.848 --> 26:52.865
Door!

26:53.973 --> 26:56.271
Northstream has blood on its hands.

26:56.391 --> 27:00.531
I've been up North,
seen what they done.

27:03.473 --> 27:06.699
You think getting pissed
is going to help?

27:07.516 --> 27:12.364
I filed a report. Submitted it
to the Federal Health Department

27:12.932 --> 27:17.604
and within three months,
half a dozen so called colleagues

27:17.724 --> 27:21.407
have signed a document
discrediting me.

27:22.969 --> 27:25.153
I'm ruined.

27:46.427 --> 27:48.818
Can I make you a coffee...

27:52.885 --> 27:54.985
I'm scared.

27:59.676 --> 28:03.193
I'm really scared.

28:06.927 --> 28:09.610
Can you stay with me.

28:14.220 --> 28:16.484
Jesus, Suzy.

28:19.301 --> 28:22.444
- They're following me.
- Who is?

28:29.591 --> 28:33.440
Just don't leave me, okay?

28:39.300 --> 28:42.025
I should go see your kids.

28:51.925 --> 28:56.139
I'll get Father Greg to tomorrow to come
round and take you to a meeting.

28:56.259 --> 28:59.983
I don't need a fucking meeting!

29:06.341 --> 29:08.566
Just go.

29:13.967 --> 29:16.566
Just fucking go.

29:28.340 --> 29:32.942
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls!

29:52.843 --> 29:57.025
It looks like a pretty
tight race to me.

30:01.259 --> 30:03.722
- It says here you poked him in the eye.
- I tried to talk to him.

30:03.842 --> 30:07.483
- Then kicked him in the balls.
- It was just a tap love.

30:07.716 --> 30:09.691
His brother has lodged a complaint
with the council.

30:09.967 --> 30:13.304
Use of undue force.
Think you're gonna get a warning.

30:13.424 --> 30:15.651
Jesus, Jim, no wonder
everyone's staring at us!

30:16.217 --> 30:18.471
Is there anything else you want
to tell me about?

30:18.591 --> 30:21.805
- Tribal Elders are pissed.
- Why what's he done now?

30:21.925 --> 30:23.544
You know the casino
on the edge of town?

30:23.664 --> 30:25.087
Yeah the one they built
on the reservation?

30:25.207 --> 30:27.586
It's not a reservation love.
It's a Reserve.

30:27.706 --> 30:30.681
Reservation is American apparently.

30:31.124 --> 30:34.003
Anyways, my father borrowed
a lot of money to get that build.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.128
So?

30:35.248 --> 30:36.795
They need the refinery
to get people into the casino.

30:36.915 --> 30:38.723
If you're against the refinery,
you're against their casino.

30:38.874 --> 30:41.836
I thought people
loved the police in Canada.

30:41.956 --> 30:44.003
Yeah, till you got here, evidently.

30:44.123 --> 30:48.796
We came here to get away from
the wreckage, not make more of it.

30:48.916 --> 30:51.764
We agreed. Peace.

30:54.831 --> 30:56.848
Unit One, this is Unit Three. Come in.

30:57.416 --> 30:59.670
We got a 10-38 on Moose Mountain.

30:59.790 --> 31:02.670
I'm British Nick,
I'm not up on the 10 codes..

31:02.790 --> 31:06.890
- Can I have it in English?
- Just get here, Chief. Quick.

31:07.915 --> 31:09.680
Right.

31:41.581 --> 31:43.931
Touched anything?

32:15.956 --> 32:18.380
Where do elves live?

32:18.500 --> 32:22.962
- In the woods.
- How come I never see them?

32:23.082 --> 32:26.056
They only come out at night.

32:27.733 --> 32:30.124
Are you okay?

32:51.733 --> 32:53.238
If she was planning to top herself,

32:53.358 --> 32:57.124
she wouldn't have done it
after a glass of fucking Rioja.

32:57.650 --> 33:00.583
And she'd have told me.
She trusted me.

33:03.567 --> 33:06.822
You know how many alcoholics
commit suicide?

33:06.942 --> 33:09.322
No note.

33:09.442 --> 33:14.000
No call. She just drives lay-by
and blows her brains out?

33:15.775 --> 33:17.875
I don't buy it.

33:23.525 --> 33:27.459
All I know is that Suzy was going
after Northstream.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.901
After that she was black listed.

33:34.842 --> 33:37.150
There's something...

34:10.467 --> 34:14.013
- Hello.
- What if she didn't kill herself?

34:14.132 --> 34:15.900
The coroner agreed it was suicide.

34:18.007 --> 34:20.025
Something's not right here.

34:21.675 --> 34:24.150
You ever worked a homicide?

36:05.716 --> 36:08.151
Elves.

37:09.550 --> 37:11.983
I'll go, love.

37:16.093 --> 37:20.192
- It's five in the morning mate.
- There's a monster

37:29.716 --> 37:33.139
- What's going on?
- There's someone outside.

37:33.259 --> 37:35.859
- What?
- Get dressed.

37:36.383 --> 37:38.848
- How soon can you get here?
- Twenty minutes.

37:38.968 --> 37:42.566
- Something wrong, Chief?
- As soon as you can then.

37:56.217 --> 37:57.858
Fuck.

38:05.300 --> 38:08.360
- Jesus, Jim.
- Come on.

38:09.092 --> 38:11.025
- Fuck!
- Dad.

38:22.883 --> 38:24.817
Good girl...

38:26.883 --> 38:29.264
Right, this is what we are gonna do.
I'm gonna start the car,

38:29.384 --> 38:33.556
I'm gonna put the door up. And I'm gonna
drive right out, straight out.

38:33.676 --> 38:37.943
I want you to duck down,
right, tuck down, an stay like this.

38:38.093 --> 38:40.068
See you do it? That's it.

38:46.052 --> 38:50.153
Jesus, I told you to fix that thing!
Stay down, stay down.

39:16.718 --> 39:19.640
Where are we going?

39:19.760 --> 39:21.610
Calgary.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.651
- What just happened there, Jim?
- I don't know, love.

39:32.927 --> 39:34.235
- Everything okay, Chief?
- Yeah.

39:34.635 --> 39:36.808
Be a sniper's bullet in the front room.

39:36.928 --> 39:39.807
Found it. Also broken window,
ground floor.

39:39.927 --> 39:42.932
Fire damage to the downstairs
bathroom. We contained it.

39:43.052 --> 39:45.973
And an empty briefcase on the porch.

39:46.093 --> 39:48.027
- Nick's checking the perimeter now.
- Good.

39:57.219 --> 39:59.153
Fuck.

40:25.677 --> 40:27.651
You stay in the car love.

40:38.885 --> 40:40.390
I need a wee wee.

40:40.510 --> 40:44.568
Can you hold it?
Petey, I don't think there's a loo here.

40:49.635 --> 40:52.180
- I'm gonna pee my pants!
- Dad, Pete needs the loo.

40:52.300 --> 40:53.985
Not now, love.

41:01.803 --> 41:05.902
- I need a wee wee.
- Not now pal, sorry.

41:06.635 --> 41:08.860
He's five years-old!
30 seconds for a piss behind the car.

41:10.343 --> 41:13.848
- I need a wee wee.
- I said no.

41:13.968 --> 41:17.319
I'm gonna pee my pants!

41:20.968 --> 41:22.400
Dad!

42:17.510 --> 42:19.944
He was only five.
