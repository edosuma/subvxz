01:09.570 --> 01:12.460
Fart joke.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.800
Sir, you need to get ready

01:16.920 --> 01:19.630
for your lifetime achievement
award ceremony.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.780
Thank you, shape-shifting valet.

01:21.860 --> 01:24.470
Remember, sir, I can be
any shape you wish.

01:24.550 --> 01:27.310
Yeah, but you're
already this, so...

01:34.390 --> 01:35.630
Excuse me.

01:35.710 --> 01:36.630
Pardon me.

01:36.650 --> 01:38.320
Beg your pardon.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.710
Coming through.

01:39.710 --> 01:40.490
Nice to see you.

01:40.610 --> 01:42.560
Thank you for coming.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.550
What if I told you
you could accumulate

01:49.560 --> 01:50.810
all the wealth
you'd ever want

01:50.830 --> 01:53.330
simply by learning
the secrets of real estate?

01:53.410 --> 01:54.730
Oop, wrong room.

01:54.730 --> 01:56.740
And then what if
you could use that wealth

01:56.820 --> 02:00.090
to turn yourself
into a Broadway star?

02:11.670 --> 02:13.590
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen

02:13.670 --> 02:16.670
and 14 other genders
we have now.

02:16.750 --> 02:17.750
I'm Lane Bergan,

02:17.750 --> 02:21.680
the biggest star
of May 2020 and on.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.420
So, if you've only watched TV
up until April of 2020,

02:25.430 --> 02:28.430
my name would be
unfamiliar to you.

02:28.430 --> 02:29.440
Lane Bergan?

02:29.520 --> 02:32.160
What, did Brett Kingston say no?

02:34.770 --> 02:37.790
When the Dwayne Johnson Center
for Confusing Ethnicity

02:37.860 --> 02:40.550
approached me about
hosting this night,

02:40.620 --> 02:43.110
I said it'd be
an honor to bestow upon

02:43.110 --> 02:47.870
Stewart Gilligan Griffin
our Lifetime Achievement Award.

02:47.890 --> 02:50.720
When Stewie invented
the Wipeless Dump,

02:50.840 --> 02:54.560
our rainforests were
hanging on by a thread.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.140
Now, are there too many trees?

02:58.220 --> 03:01.460
Ladies and gentlemen,
Stewart Griffin.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.640
Thank you for this
wonderful honor.

03:12.940 --> 03:15.320
It's so wonderful to be
here with all of you.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.920
You guys mind stopping
for just one minute?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.400
When I heard I was going
to be receiving this award, I...

03:23.570 --> 03:24.980
I'm not the person
who yells at waiters,

03:24.990 --> 03:27.760
but maybe everyone
bussing tables can freeze?

03:27.840 --> 03:29.820
I-I don't understand
why I'm the person

03:29.820 --> 03:31.840
who has to be saying this, okay?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.770
Okay, I'll never forget
the first time I...

03:35.660 --> 03:37.600
Wow, really?

03:37.720 --> 03:39.610
This award means the world to...

03:40.830 --> 03:42.680
...me...

03:42.760 --> 03:43.850
and I want to thank...

03:43.970 --> 03:46.600
everyone who...

03:46.670 --> 03:47.780
Anybody with
a bowtie on,

03:47.860 --> 03:49.860
stop what you're doing,
walk into the coatroom,

03:49.930 --> 03:52.620
and don't come out
until I'm done talking!

03:54.680 --> 03:57.520
I-I don't yell at waiters.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.960
I'm now going
to stop mid-sentence

03:59.040 --> 04:02.540
because I see someone
from my...

04:02.610 --> 04:04.300
Brian?

04:13.790 --> 04:15.720
So, Brian,
how's Frank Sinatra, Jr.?

04:15.790 --> 04:17.490
You two still hanging out?

04:17.500 --> 04:18.649
No. He died.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.390
I'll never forget it,

04:20.459 --> 04:22.560
it was Spiro Agnew's birthday.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.650
Wow, so you, uh,
really went all-in

04:24.730 --> 04:25.880
with the Japanese screens.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.150
Yes, I really like
changing in silhouette

04:28.230 --> 04:29.560
while carrying
on a conversation.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.160
Will you excuse me?

04:33.640 --> 04:35.400
So, how was your flight?

04:35.480 --> 04:36.660
It was, uh, it was fine.

04:36.740 --> 04:38.670
I had a layover in Atlanta...

04:38.740 --> 04:40.220
What are you doing back there?

04:40.230 --> 04:42.560
Just getting into something
more comfortable.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.900
Can I interest you
in a nightcap?

04:43.900 --> 04:45.510
-I think I've got...
-Who is that?

04:45.620 --> 04:47.730
A little privacy, please!

04:47.730 --> 04:48.580
What the hell was all that?

04:48.660 --> 04:50.080
I have a lot of money, Brian.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.220
But let's continue this while
I take a very foggy shower.

04:56.670 --> 04:57.760
No, Stewie, come on.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.840
I haven't seen you
in almost 50 years.

04:59.910 --> 05:02.260
And you haven't even
told me how great I look.

05:02.340 --> 05:02.760
You do look great.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.920
Thanks to me.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.530
I invented a pill
to extend your life.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.600
It's called "Semper Fido."

05:08.680 --> 05:10.100
What? Why?

05:10.180 --> 05:12.620
Aren't you going to say anything
about the cute name I gave it?

05:12.630 --> 05:13.440
Ha.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.530
What? Why?

05:14.610 --> 05:16.090
I snuck it in your food
because I wanted you

05:16.100 --> 05:18.930
to live long enough to see that
global warming is bull crap.

05:18.930 --> 05:21.450
Oh, my God, we were
so wrong about that.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.530
If anything,
it's way colder now.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.540
Yes, and now thanks to you,

05:24.620 --> 05:26.710
we're stuck
with President Polar Bear.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.550
President Polar Bear,
is it true

05:28.670 --> 05:29.770
you ate the presidential seal?

05:29.780 --> 05:31.630
That was a simple
misunderstanding.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.550
-No further questions.
-President Polar Bear!

05:33.630 --> 05:35.800
President Polar Bear, what did
you do for a Klondike bar?

05:35.870 --> 05:39.730
I believe the president has
answered all of your questions.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.120
Here's what I don't understand--

05:42.120 --> 05:43.450
why did you even want me
to live this long

05:43.460 --> 05:44.550
if you were just gonna leave me?

05:44.620 --> 05:45.960
It's not about you, Brian.

05:45.960 --> 05:46.960
I couldn't take it back there.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.790
But they were your family,
Stewie.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.460
I guess I'm just
not a family guy.

05:52.820 --> 05:56.450
Mom and Dad always wanted me
to be someone I wasn't.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.820
Stewie Griffin,
get in here right now!

06:01.900 --> 06:03.990
-Yeah?
-Well, I just got
our Christmas card photos.

06:04.110 --> 06:07.070
You want to tell me what you're
doing with your hands here?

06:07.150 --> 06:07.590
Nothing.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.070
Exactly, nothing.

06:09.150 --> 06:11.910
And what does the greeting
at the top of the card say?

06:11.990 --> 06:14.990
"Merry Christmas
and a Shocking New Year."

06:14.990 --> 06:16.490
And what is every
other member of the family

06:16.490 --> 06:17.600
doing with their hands?

06:17.720 --> 06:19.080
-The shocker.
-Right.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.830
Now, listen, Stewie,
I'm a cool dad, all right?

06:21.830 --> 06:24.620
I could care less what you
do with the pink, truly.

06:24.620 --> 06:27.180
But the stink is where
you get the "shocking."

06:27.260 --> 06:27.850
You get that?

06:27.930 --> 06:28.850
You get what I'm saying?

06:28.970 --> 06:31.170
Even if it's just one,
that's fine.

06:31.170 --> 06:32.000
But you got to put
something there.

06:32.010 --> 06:33.520
I-I think it's gonna be fine.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.450
I'm sure people
won't even notice.

06:37.340 --> 06:38.600
Oh...

06:38.680 --> 06:39.690
Anyway, that's why I left.

06:39.770 --> 06:41.510
Well, that was a long time ago.

06:41.510 --> 06:43.350
You have to come back.

06:43.350 --> 06:44.370
Stewie...

06:44.440 --> 06:45.520
Peter is dying.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.460
What?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.540
Oh, my God, that's awful.

06:48.610 --> 06:49.460
So, you'll come see him?

06:49.540 --> 06:50.690
Of course.

06:50.690 --> 06:51.800
You know, he once
asked me in the event

06:51.870 --> 06:54.710
that he was sick
to clear his Google history.

06:54.830 --> 06:57.930
"Peter Griffin search history."

06:58.550 --> 06:59.700
"Winnie the Pooh,

06:59.700 --> 07:01.460

07:01.530 --> 07:03.880

07:14.710 --> 07:16.710
Wow. Huge turn there.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.490
"Piglet pencil erasers."

07:18.570 --> 07:19.900
Okay, getting back in there.

07:19.980 --> 07:22.570
"Full cast Winnie
the Pooh backpack."

07:22.650 --> 07:24.810
Oh, "cancer symptoms," yeah.

07:24.890 --> 07:27.330
"Coughing up blood,
pain in abdomen,

07:27.450 --> 07:28.730
Winnie the Pooh casket."

07:28.730 --> 07:29.730
Yeah, he is sick.

07:29.730 --> 07:30.820
You know, while we're here,

07:30.900 --> 07:32.510
let's take a look
at <i> your</i> search history.

07:32.580 --> 07:33.730
No, Stewie, that's...

07:33.730 --> 07:35.660
"Spiro Agnew birthday."

07:35.740 --> 07:39.300
What a weird thing to try
to impress me with.

07:45.110 --> 07:47.030
Okay, first stop, Chris Griffin.

07:47.110 --> 07:48.200
We have to pick up Chris?

07:48.280 --> 07:49.370
Yeah, what's the problem?

07:49.490 --> 07:51.460
Uh, we didn't exactly
get along too well.

07:51.580 --> 07:56.030
Especially after Grandpa died
and left <i> me</i> the dark boathouse.

07:56.030 --> 07:57.140
You can still use the boathouse

07:57.250 --> 07:59.360
on non-vacation Sundays
in the spring.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.870
I've always taken
care of you, Chris.

08:01.870 --> 08:03.220
Taken care of me?

08:03.250 --> 08:06.810
You're my kid brother,
<i> you</i> take care of <i> me?</i>

08:06.890 --> 08:08.220
Sorry, I came down here to vape.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.150
Send Chris off to do this,
send Chris off to do that.

08:11.230 --> 08:13.300
I'm supposed to be
shoveling the driveway.

08:13.320 --> 08:17.160
I'm your older brother, Stewie,
and I was stepped over!

08:17.230 --> 08:19.140
It's the way Grandpa wanted it.

08:19.220 --> 08:21.140
It ain't the way I wanted it!

08:21.160 --> 08:23.070
Sounds like you're having
a personal conversation.

08:23.190 --> 08:24.330
I'll put in my earbuds.

08:24.410 --> 08:25.310
I'm smart!

08:25.390 --> 08:28.170
Not like everybody says,
like dumb.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.320
I'm smart and I want respect.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.470
¶ Funky Cold Medina. ¶

08:39.909 --> 08:41.159
Chris, you live in filth.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.179
What have you been doing?

08:42.260 --> 08:44.260
Yeah, I kind of wasted my life,

08:44.330 --> 08:47.340
except I obsessed over
teaching my penis how to talk.

08:47.410 --> 08:48.260
What?

08:48.340 --> 08:49.260
Who's out there?.

08:49.340 --> 08:50.690
Settle down,
just got some company.

08:50.770 --> 08:53.250
Well, aren't you going
to introduce me?

08:53.250 --> 08:55.530
I'm getting to it,
if-if you'll give me a second.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.270
I want to have a look at them.

08:57.390 --> 09:00.850
Hey, numbskull, that's how we
got in trouble the last time.

09:01.930 --> 09:03.430
He-he's really very friendly.

09:03.450 --> 09:06.020
Where's the Jamba Juice
you were gonna get me?

09:06.040 --> 09:08.120
Never mind,
I'll order it on Postmates.

09:08.190 --> 09:09.220
No, you won't.

09:09.230 --> 09:12.540
Stop spending all our money.

09:15.290 --> 09:17.110
So, what's Meg
been up to anyway?

09:17.110 --> 09:19.940
She runs a small
private security business

09:19.950 --> 09:20.870
out in the desert.

09:20.950 --> 09:22.110
That sounds kind of cool.

09:22.110 --> 09:25.950
Well, she basically just
tests bulletproof vests.

09:26.970 --> 09:28.800
-Ready?
-One sec.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.900
Yeah, go, go, go.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.890
Ooh... yeah.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.060
This one can use another layer.

09:45.140 --> 09:46.910
Oh, hey, guys.

09:46.990 --> 09:48.160
Um, are you okay?

09:48.230 --> 09:49.420
Yeah, I'll be fine.

09:49.490 --> 09:51.810
Hi, Meg. Bring it in.

09:51.810 --> 09:52.920
Hi, Chris' Penis.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.140
How are you?

09:54.150 --> 09:56.840
Same spit, different day.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.080
Wow, look at Quahog.

¶<i> Right in your head</i> ¶

10:22.100 --> 10:23.260
¶<i> Without a device.</i> ¶

10:23.340 --> 10:25.010
<i> Try turning it off.</i>

10:25.010 --> 10:26.340
<i> You can't!</i>

10:26.350 --> 10:27.600
That's not all
that hasn't changed.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.700
Cleveland's still on hold
with United Airlines.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.870
I'm starting to think my call
is not important to them.

10:38.950 --> 10:40.210
<i> Your call is important to us.</i>

10:40.280 --> 10:42.630
<i> Thank you for remaining</i>
<i> on the line.</i>

10:42.710 --> 10:46.530
All right, you just bought
yourself another year.

10:46.530 --> 10:48.310
And Seamus is still on hold
with Spirit Airlines.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.220
<i> We don't give a crap about you,</i>
<i> but we're the cheapest,</i>

10:51.290 --> 10:54.870
<i> -so sit there and take it.</i>
-Ah, sea turds.

10:56.060 --> 10:59.210
Mr. Seamus, five minutes
to showtime, Mr. Seamus.

10:59.210 --> 11:01.230
Oh, I want to fly standby
to Pittsburgh,

11:01.300 --> 11:04.730
but I also want to host
<i> The Muppet Show.</i>

11:09.220 --> 11:11.650
Look at all this traffic.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.980
Yeah, Brady Boulevard
is tight this time of day.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.240
You know what?
Cut over to Brady on Brady

11:16.320 --> 11:18.150
and then take the Brady Bridge.

11:18.230 --> 11:20.250
Is everything in this town
named after Tom Brady?

11:20.320 --> 11:23.750
Oh, no, there's the
Rob Gronkowski Library.

11:23.830 --> 11:26.240
The only book is just a label
ripped off a Muscle Milk bottle.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.850
And look, there's the
Robert Kraft Marina,

11:28.920 --> 11:30.570
full of tugboats.

11:30.580 --> 11:34.560
I heard he had a stroke.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.080
I can't even get my bearings.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.420
I'm gonna ask someone
for directions.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.030
I wouldn't do that.
Since you left,

11:41.100 --> 11:43.860
the New England accent
has become incomprehensible.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.110
I'm sure it's not that bad.

11:45.180 --> 11:47.930
Excuse me, sir,
where is the Quahog Harbor?

11:47.930 --> 11:49.430
-Cah gabbah?
-What?

11:49.430 --> 11:51.870
I-I just, I just want to know
where the Quahog Harbor is.

11:51.950 --> 11:52.950
Cah gabbah.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.950
Uh-oh, there's a lot of guys

11:55.030 --> 11:57.120
in Bruins hats
turning around now.

11:57.190 --> 12:00.450
-Abbah dabbah.
-Gwin' dahsee da Sawx.
-N'abbah dabbah.

12:00.530 --> 12:02.030
-Cah gabbah.
-Gwin' dahsee da Sawx.

12:06.370 --> 12:09.510
Aah! Brian, get out of here.
Go, go, go!

12:12.280 --> 12:14.280
Christopher
"Irish or Italian name,"

12:14.290 --> 12:16.290
are you causing trouble
out there?

12:16.290 --> 12:18.050
-No, Ma.
-Nomah?
-Nomah!

12:18.120 --> 12:20.820
-Nomah!
-Nomah!
-Nomah!

12:27.390 --> 12:29.150
What the hell happened
to the neighborhood?

12:29.270 --> 12:30.320
Hey, Stewie.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.240
Here comes a double scoop
of trouble.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.990
Whoa, you look great,
considering your age.

12:35.070 --> 12:36.320
Yeah, I'm basically
exactly the same,

12:36.400 --> 12:39.070
except I pretty much only talk
about ice cream now.

12:39.140 --> 12:40.310
Oh, that's cool, that's cool.

12:40.310 --> 12:42.250
Yeah, you know what's cool?
Ice cream.

12:42.330 --> 12:44.310
Want to go get a cup?
Cone? Bowl?

12:44.320 --> 12:45.830
I-I'm just trying
to see my folks.

12:45.910 --> 12:47.320
Man, I love ice cream.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.000
You know there's three different
ice cream shops in Quahog?

12:50.120 --> 12:51.910
-They're all good.
-What's your favorite?

12:51.990 --> 12:53.930
They're all good.

12:54.010 --> 12:56.100
So that's the scoop from here.

12:56.180 --> 12:58.420
All right, well,
good running into you, man.

12:58.500 --> 13:02.940
Oh, my babies,
finally all together again.

13:03.020 --> 13:04.090
Hello, Mother.

13:04.170 --> 13:06.170
I mean, uh,
damn you, vile woman.

13:06.170 --> 13:08.170
I must kill you,
et cetera, et cetera.

13:10.530 --> 13:13.120
-Did Quagmire tell you
about the ice cream?
-Yes.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.030
You know, there are three
ice cream parlors in town.

13:16.110 --> 13:18.370
-We know.
-They're all good.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.290
-Yes, he said that.
-They're all good.

13:20.370 --> 13:22.940
Have we already
run out of conversation?

13:23.020 --> 13:24.800
Chris, Meg, how are you?

13:24.870 --> 13:26.630
-Good, Ma.
-How are you?

13:26.710 --> 13:28.300
Oh, I can't complain.
Little hard of hearing,

13:28.380 --> 13:31.030
which is why I turned on
the closed captioning.

13:31.030 --> 13:33.640
It's about 30 seconds
behind, though.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.290
Wow, that is way behind.

13:36.370 --> 13:38.630
Now, what would you kids
like for dinner?

13:38.700 --> 13:42.560
-It's 3:15, Ma.
-I know, we waited for you.

13:46.380 --> 13:48.710
Yeah, we-we can go ahead
and turn that off.

13:48.710 --> 13:50.490
How's Dad?

13:53.390 --> 13:55.550
Your father's
had severe diabetes

13:55.550 --> 13:59.150
ever since they opened
three ice cream stores in town.

13:59.220 --> 14:00.500
They're all good.

14:00.580 --> 14:03.410
You can't live like this,
the house is falling apart.

14:03.490 --> 14:05.150
This is awful,
and it's all my fault.

14:05.230 --> 14:08.010
Oh, Pop, I am so sorry
I abandoned you all.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.340
I never should've left home.
What can I do?

14:10.460 --> 14:15.180
Just promise, when I die,
that you will help our family.

14:15.260 --> 14:17.170
I will, I promise.

14:17.180 --> 14:20.340
This family will never want
for anything ever again.

14:20.410 --> 14:22.850
-That's so generous.
-Thank you.

14:22.970 --> 14:24.080
Chris, your hand.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.270
All right,
now that that's settled,

14:25.340 --> 14:27.930
let's celebrate
with some of the music of now

14:28.010 --> 14:29.820
with closed captioning.

14:31.010 --> 14:33.370
¶<i> Music of now, music of now</i> ¶

14:46.270 --> 14:48.380
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker,
delivering the news

14:48.460 --> 14:51.880
with my Andy Rooney
end-of-life eyebrows.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.610
You won't hear
anything I'm saying

14:53.610 --> 14:55.040
because they're so distracting.

14:55.110 --> 14:57.720
Now, let's go to Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa,

14:57.800 --> 15:01.120
so we can be shocked at how well
her people age. Tricia?

15:01.120 --> 15:04.050
Tom, I'm standing here
with flawless skin

15:04.060 --> 15:07.810
next to the shedding, crumbling,
dusty ancient relics

15:07.880 --> 15:10.890
of white people my age.

15:12.430 --> 15:15.240
Oh, Stewie, you've done so much
to help our family.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.320
I can't believe
you put in an elevator.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.970
Yes, and it even has
elevator music.

15:20.970 --> 15:24.400
¶<i> Music of now, music of now.</i> ¶

15:24.480 --> 15:27.310
Aw, and thanks for these
virtual reality glasses,

15:27.310 --> 15:30.660
so I can watch porn
while talking to the family.

15:30.740 --> 15:33.740
So what's California
like, Stewie? Ugh.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.930
That was a penis.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.100
So, do-do you still want to know
about California?

15:38.170 --> 15:39.160
No, I'm done.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.540
I have one more dying wish.

15:42.620 --> 15:46.190
Play the song, but play it slow
because I am old.

15:47.500 --> 15:51.000
¶<i> A-well-a everybody's heard</i> ¶

15:51.000 --> 15:53.170

-I'll say when.

¶<i> A-well, a bird, bird, bird</i> ¶

16:05.030 --> 16:07.790

16:15.290 --> 16:17.590

16:23.870 --> 16:26.040
Oh, Dr. Hartman,
thank you for coming.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.150
Actually, I'm Dr. Hartman's son.

16:28.220 --> 16:31.060
Doctor Hartmanson?
But I asked for Dr. Hartman.

16:31.180 --> 16:33.040
His jokes are getting worse,
Doctor.

16:33.050 --> 16:35.970
Is there anything
you can do for him?

16:36.050 --> 16:38.780
Now all we can do is wait.

16:41.050 --> 16:43.240
Lois... it's time.

16:43.310 --> 16:47.540
Oh, Peter,
I'm gonna miss you so much.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.170
I see a white light.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.840
There are others inside of it.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.510
Adam West, Carrie Fisher,

16:56.590 --> 16:58.340
Ricardo Montalbán,
Phyllis Diller...

16:58.420 --> 17:01.250
Heaven is filled
with every actor who ever died?

17:01.330 --> 17:04.089
No, this is actually
just the ones who did our show

17:04.170 --> 17:06.020
right before they died.
Crazy, right?

17:06.089 --> 17:08.760
Frank Sinatra Jr.,
Charles Durning,

17:08.839 --> 17:11.250
Lauren Bacall,
Rodney Dangerfield,

17:11.250 --> 17:13.339
Roy Scheider, Waylon Jennings,

17:13.420 --> 17:16.220
Ed Asner by the time
this airs certainly...

17:16.220 --> 17:18.349
Dad, you don't have to do this,
there are too many.

17:18.420 --> 17:21.270
Uh-oh, Conway Twitty is here,
and he's pissed.

17:21.390 --> 17:23.280
Wait, he's wearing
the Darth Vader helmet.

17:23.349 --> 17:26.930
Never mind,
he was cool with it.

17:26.930 --> 17:30.100
This is it.

17:32.290 --> 17:34.710
Oh, he's trying
to say something.

17:34.830 --> 17:36.860
H-His final words.

17:36.940 --> 17:38.050
Lactating...

17:38.130 --> 17:40.890
pregnant... Latinas.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.770
I will, Dad, I promise.

17:55.480 --> 18:00.130
No, we won't cry for him,
we will celebrate his life.

18:00.130 --> 18:03.820
The finest cigars for
the finest family ever to live.

18:03.940 --> 18:06.730
Oh, Stewie, we love you so much.

18:06.810 --> 18:10.160
And I love you, which is why
I must not delay any longer.

18:10.230 --> 18:11.320
I must get my affairs in order

18:11.440 --> 18:14.810
and transfer my money
to all of you.

18:14.810 --> 18:17.000
-I will see you all soon.
-Oh, thank you, Stewie.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.630
-We love you.
-Thanks.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.170
We did it. We got him.

18:43.180 --> 18:44.510
I feel like we're in <i> The Sting,</i>

18:44.510 --> 18:48.860
that movie from 100 years ago
about 150 years ago.

18:48.940 --> 18:50.350
Great work tricking him, Brian.

18:50.350 --> 18:53.200
Thanks. Well, you know,
I credit my years as a writer.

18:53.630 --> 18:56.310
When I planned the con,
I saw Quahog as a character...

18:56.390 --> 18:58.020
Okay, that's enough.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.400
<i>Had a pebble in my shoe.</i>

19:09.480 --> 19:12.140
<i> Of course I knew</i>
<i> the whole thing was a scam.</i>

19:12.220 --> 19:14.480
<i> They probably did that "crying</i>
<i> turning into laughing" thing</i>

19:14.500 --> 19:16.650
<i> when I left,</i>
<i> what a bunch of hacks.</i>

19:16.730 --> 19:18.730
<i> They're too stupid to notice</i>
<i> I snuck into the kitchen</i>

19:18.730 --> 19:20.820
<i> and turned up the gas</i>

19:20.900 --> 19:25.050
<i> Chris should be lighting</i>
<i> his cigar right about...</i>

19:26.510 --> 19:28.680
Stewie, help.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.010
It hurts! Reverse the pill!
Let me die!

19:32.090 --> 19:37.260
Ooh, wish I could, but the pills
were in the house, so, yeah...

19:37.340 --> 19:39.260
Stewie. Stewie!

19:39.380 --> 19:42.360
Stewie!
Stewie!

19:42.430 --> 19:44.530
Stewie! Stewie!

19:44.600 --> 19:45.920
Huh? What?

19:45.920 --> 19:47.600
What the hell is wrong with you?
You've been staring

19:47.720 --> 19:50.510
at that old man Halloween
costume for 30 minutes.

19:50.530 --> 19:53.680
21 plus commercials,
but it's a big decision.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.780
You know, I've always been
afraid of being old,

19:56.860 --> 20:00.040
but now I think
I'll like it just fine.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.460
Why are you walking so slowly?

20:07.530 --> 20:10.370
Turns out this costume
is about 80% balls,

20:10.390 --> 20:14.280
and most of it's
dragging behind me.

20:15.450 --> 20:17.880
-Uhp, we got a tangle.
-Uhp, what do I do?

20:17.950 --> 20:19.140
Stop walking.
I'll go back, you go forward.

20:19.210 --> 20:20.470
-Are you sure?
-It's counterintuitive.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.620
I don't know, that-that
doesn't seem right to me.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.550
-When you want to go left,
you go right.
-I'm just gonna pull forward.

20:24.570 --> 20:26.810
-Don't pull, don't pull.
-I-I think if you come this way,

20:26.890 --> 20:29.900
-and I go that way...
-Just stop walking and listen
to me. Everybody freeze.

20:29.980 --> 20:32.160
Okay, let's just
think about this.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.710
People of Argentina,

20:40.790 --> 20:42.400
I have heard your cries,

20:42.520 --> 20:44.490
and I just want to say...

20:44.500 --> 20:45.630
Meg. Meg!

20:45.630 --> 20:47.720
I already told you
you're not gonna be Evita.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.630
You're gonna be the back half
of Edgar the Farting Horse.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.240
Now get in.

20:56.730 --> 20:59.250
Hey. I do the farting.
