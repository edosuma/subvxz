Air 14 coming
for the watch commander.

00:12.342 --> 00:14.049
Air 14's on.
Go ahead, sir.

00:14.083 --> 00:15.926
Yeah, police 14.
We are over the call.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.631
I've got a body in sight.

00:18.666 --> 00:22.205
He is tied up in the wires
on the side of the building.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.441
Looks like he might have
some, uh, head wounds...

00:24.475 --> 00:25.876
Possible gunshot wounds, guys.

00:27.012 --> 00:29.048
Air 14 to the units...
I got you there.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.052
Uh, use caution, guys.
I cannot clear the inside.

00:31.087 --> 00:33.322
I have no movement, but we
might have additional victims.

00:33.356 --> 00:35.057
We might also have
a shooter in the area.

00:35.091 --> 00:36.292
Use caution, gentlemen.

00:36.327 --> 00:39.396
Airship 14, confirm
the body is in the wires.

00:39.431 --> 00:40.664
Yeah, Roger that.

00:40.699 --> 00:43.401
He's caught up in the wires
outside the house.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.374
Aah!

00:51.177 --> 00:52.644
Air 14 to the guys
on the ground...

00:52.679 --> 00:54.146
Just talked
to the watch commander.

00:54.181 --> 00:56.016
Be advised... he wants you
to secure the scene

00:56.050 --> 00:57.750
And wait for major crimes.

00:57.785 --> 00:59.118
Air 14.

00:59.153 --> 01:00.687
Hey, guys, this is
a major crimes case.

01:00.721 --> 01:02.589
Just secure the scene
and stand by for them,

01:02.623 --> 01:03.890
Per the watch commander.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:22.010 --> 01:23.844
But I'd rather have
Mr. Beebe's body

01:23.878 --> 01:25.046
<i>Brought back up here.</i>

01:25.080 --> 01:27.049
I know, but it's
the fire department's call,

01:27.083 --> 01:28.851
And they want him
lowered to the ground.

01:28.885 --> 01:29.885
fine.

01:31.355 --> 01:33.122
excuse me.
Uh, Mr. Fireman.

01:33.157 --> 01:34.525
When you finally cut him loose

01:34.559 --> 01:36.627
<i>And he slams
against the side of the house,</i>

01:36.662 --> 01:38.630
Could you cover him
with a tarp, please?

01:38.664 --> 01:40.732
I don't want
Mr. Beebe's friends and family

01:40.766 --> 01:43.067
To see him like this.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.070
Detective Gabriel,
now that our new building

01:45.104 --> 01:47.573
Has its own briefing room,
would you kindly ask the press

01:47.608 --> 01:49.542
To go downtown
to meet with commander Taylor?

01:49.577 --> 01:50.710
Um...Yeah. Sure.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.677
What do you want
the reporters to know?

01:52.711 --> 01:54.511
That it doesn't look like
a suicide.

01:57.844 --> 02:01.814
So, chief, it seems
Mr. Beebe was shot before dawn

02:01.849 --> 02:04.218
While his computer
was logging photographs

02:04.252 --> 02:05.319
Off the telescope.

02:05.353 --> 02:06.620
Photographs of what?

02:06.655 --> 02:09.523
Can't say. His laptop goes
to sleep after five minutes.

02:09.558 --> 02:12.593
I need a password to log
back on, and...I don't have it.

02:12.627 --> 02:14.428
Maybe he was
scanning the neighborhood

02:14.463 --> 02:16.263
for, uh, heavenly bodies.

02:16.298 --> 02:17.398
Well [chuckles]

02:17.432 --> 02:19.734
He has a heavenly body
in his...Bedroom...

02:19.768 --> 02:21.836
A Mrs. Cherie Walker.

02:21.870 --> 02:23.971
<i>And she really
wants to leave here</i>

02:24.005 --> 02:26.406
Before her husband finds out
where she spent the night.

02:26.441 --> 02:27.674
Could you please tell her

02:27.708 --> 02:29.843
I'll be down there
to speak with her in a minute?

02:31.913 --> 02:33.513
So...

02:33.548 --> 02:35.582
Detective Sanchez,
do we have any idea

02:35.616 --> 02:37.751
How things played out here?

02:37.785 --> 02:40.487
Three shots, chief...
7.62 NATO rounds.

02:40.521 --> 02:43.690
<i>The first bullet lands here,
second one, here,</i>

02:43.724 --> 02:48.461
And then one more bullet in
the back of the victim's head.

02:48.495 --> 02:51.964
The impact pushes the victim
over the railing.

02:51.998 --> 02:53.932
You know,
it had to happen fast,

02:53.967 --> 02:55.134
So automatic weapon.

02:55.168 --> 02:58.070
Judging from the angles
of the impacts,

02:58.104 --> 03:01.673
I'd say the shooter
was at least 200 yards away,

03:01.707 --> 03:03.809
Somewhere over there.

03:03.843 --> 03:05.477
So it looks like
our victim

03:05.512 --> 03:07.079
Wasn't the only one
using a scope.

03:07.113 --> 03:08.580
And it was early
in the morning,

03:08.614 --> 03:10.615
So it was a night scope,
at that.

03:10.649 --> 03:13.818
So, Mr. Beebe and Cherie
have dinner,

03:13.852 --> 03:15.920
Go downstairs
for a little intimacy,

03:15.954 --> 03:18.322
And then, at some point
early this morning,

03:18.356 --> 03:20.924
Our victim pops back up here

03:20.959 --> 03:23.560
To look at...

03:23.595 --> 03:24.561
What?

03:24.595 --> 03:26.062
I have no idea.

03:26.096 --> 03:29.899
I-I didn't even know
Steven had gotten out of bed.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.200
Look...

03:31.234 --> 03:34.636
My husband is going to be
back in town any minute.

03:34.671 --> 03:37.005
Please. You...
you have to let me go.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.841
Listen to me, Cherie.
I'm not the adultery police.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.476
The last thing I want to do

03:41.510 --> 03:44.011
Is to tell anyone
that you were having an affair.

03:44.046 --> 03:45.546
Why don't we take you downtown

03:45.581 --> 03:47.682
While we figure out
what to tell your husband?

03:47.716 --> 03:48.949
He's away in...?

03:48.984 --> 03:51.418
Palm Springs. But he's
flying back this morning.

03:51.453 --> 03:54.088
Flying? [ chuckles ]
it's a pretty quick drive.

03:54.122 --> 03:56.823
He's helping them build
a new control tower
for their airport.

03:56.858 --> 03:57.858
He always flies.

03:57.892 --> 04:00.026
And he's gonna be home
any second.

04:01.395 --> 04:03.529
And your husband's name is...?

04:03.563 --> 04:04.796
Uh, Caleb.

04:04.830 --> 04:07.798
He's a former army officer,
West point graduate,

04:07.832 --> 04:10.366
and very,
very uptight.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.468
<i>He's not... he is not
going to understand</i>

04:13.502 --> 04:15.136
My side of things at all.

04:15.170 --> 04:18.505
A-and does Caleb...Know...
Uh, Mr. Beebe?

04:18.540 --> 04:19.974
Oh. Y-yeah.

04:20.007 --> 04:22.510
He hired Steven
to rebuild our terrace.

04:22.544 --> 04:23.511
Oh.

04:23.545 --> 04:26.847
So Mr. Beebe
is y-your contractor?

04:26.882 --> 04:28.649
yeah.

04:28.683 --> 04:32.119
<i>And since Caleb travels so much,
I dealt with the remodel.</i>

04:32.153 --> 04:33.154
Oh.

04:34.222 --> 04:35.823
And... and...
and how long

04:35.857 --> 04:39.158
Have you and Steven
been seeing each other?

04:39.192 --> 04:40.891
About three weeks.

04:40.926 --> 04:44.058
He...Stopped by one night
to make sure

04:44.092 --> 04:46.859
the grilling station
had been set up properly.

04:46.893 --> 04:48.160
And it was dark out.

04:48.194 --> 04:51.396
And Steven was
pointing out the stars to me.

04:51.431 --> 04:52.731
Mmm.

04:52.765 --> 04:54.632
<i>This one and that one.</i>

04:54.666 --> 04:56.200
I'm... I'm bad
with names.

04:56.234 --> 04:58.369
Anyway, somehow or other,

04:58.403 --> 05:00.537
We...
Started making out.

05:00.572 --> 05:02.139
Aw.

05:02.173 --> 05:04.407
Steven set his alarm
for 4:00 this morning.

05:04.442 --> 05:06.576
And y-you j-just
slept right through it?

05:06.610 --> 05:09.311
Maybe 'cause of
all the champagne.

05:09.346 --> 05:11.113
Which is why
I stayed the night.

05:11.147 --> 05:13.915
I-I thought it would be
very wrong to drive home drunk.

05:13.950 --> 05:16.084
A responsible choice.

05:17.252 --> 05:19.653
Uh, tell me...
uh, take me back to last night,

05:19.688 --> 05:23.023
When you and Steven
were upstairs on the roof.

05:23.057 --> 05:25.558
Did Steven, uh,
show you anything

05:25.592 --> 05:27.559
In his telescope?

05:27.594 --> 05:30.929
Yeah. We tracked
the space station for a while.

05:30.963 --> 05:34.231
Oh, and he showed me
what our house looked
like upside down.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.866
You can see your house
from here?

05:36.901 --> 05:38.401
Mm-hmm.

05:42.872 --> 05:44.940
Okay, chief,
that's Cherie Walker's terrace,

05:44.974 --> 05:48.008
And you can see
the work being done on it.

05:50.312 --> 05:51.846
Oh!

05:51.880 --> 05:55.117
I think Mr. Walker's home
from palm Springs.

05:55.151 --> 05:57.954
And if you want to see
how he looks right-side-up,

05:57.988 --> 06:00.489
I have it.

06:02.991 --> 06:04.224
Chief.

06:04.258 --> 06:06.292
I say we wire Cherie,
send her home right now,

06:06.326 --> 06:08.093
See if she and her husband
get into it.

06:08.128 --> 06:09.561
He may have just killed
her boyfriend.

06:09.596 --> 06:10.762
What if he shoots Cherie, too?

06:10.797 --> 06:12.230
then we solved the case.

06:12.264 --> 06:13.464
at this moment,

06:13.499 --> 06:15.900
I cannot think of
a more irresponsible suggestion.

06:15.934 --> 06:20.136
No. I say we ask Mr. Walker
to visit us in our new building.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.704
He can be the first person

06:21.739 --> 06:24.240
To try out those horrible
new interview rooms.

06:24.274 --> 06:26.642
Oh, my!

06:26.676 --> 06:29.511
Oh, come on. Not again.

06:33.215 --> 06:34.181
Don't pull on it!

06:34.216 --> 06:36.650
Well, what button
are you pressing?!

06:36.684 --> 06:39.452
Just...
just let go, please.

06:42.289 --> 06:44.323
This remote control's
worthless.

06:49.329 --> 06:52.130
Okay, so, the screen
is not, uh, working yet.

06:52.164 --> 06:53.431
We'll fix that.

06:53.465 --> 06:56.000
But, otherwise,
pretty great, right?

06:56.034 --> 06:58.068
We were told that we can't have

06:58.103 --> 07:00.670
<i>A coffeemaker
or a refrigerator in here.</i>

07:00.705 --> 07:02.705
That's because
we have a break room

07:02.739 --> 07:05.174
With all that stuff in it
right down the hall.

07:05.208 --> 07:06.408
Any other complaints

07:06.442 --> 07:08.677
About your new $10 million
divisional headquarters?

07:08.711 --> 07:10.278
How about the wall

07:10.312 --> 07:12.947
Separating my office
from my conference room?

07:12.981 --> 07:14.315
Well,
that's...Nothing.

07:17.552 --> 07:19.152
She's a person of interest.

07:19.187 --> 07:20.320
Couldn't agree more.

07:21.722 --> 07:23.122
Well, why don't you go ahead
and introduce yourself?

07:23.156 --> 07:24.657
Her husband
doesn't know she's here.

07:24.692 --> 07:25.825
Oh, yeah,
speaking of her husband,

07:25.859 --> 07:27.026
I read him his rights

07:27.060 --> 07:28.861
And dumped him
in one of the interview rooms.

07:28.895 --> 07:31.529
Good luck
getting anything out of him.

07:31.564 --> 07:32.664
Lieutenant Provenza,

07:32.698 --> 07:34.598
Your desk from Parker center
is city property.

07:34.633 --> 07:36.266
It was supposed to be
sold at auction.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.869
<i>It was.
I bought it.</i>

07:39.904 --> 07:43.205
This desk is the longest
relationship of my adult life,

07:43.239 --> 07:45.273
<i>And I am not
giving it up.</i>

07:45.308 --> 07:46.341
And...

07:47.610 --> 07:50.845
These seating assignments
are ridiculous.

07:50.879 --> 07:52.212
Hm. Tao.

07:52.246 --> 07:53.847
Tao!

07:53.881 --> 07:56.449
Uh, have you been able
to get past the password

07:56.483 --> 07:58.317
On our victim's computer yet?

08:00.186 --> 08:02.387
That would mean "no."

08:02.421 --> 08:04.823
<i>C-chief,
w-we still don't know</i>

08:04.857 --> 08:07.391
What our victim was looking at
when he was shot.

08:07.426 --> 08:10.127
Is there anything else you want
us to be working on here?

08:10.161 --> 08:11.561
Yes, lieutenant, there is.

08:11.596 --> 08:13.963
Not all remodels go as planned.

08:15.265 --> 08:17.632
Let's ask
some of Mr. Beebe's employees

08:17.667 --> 08:20.201
To compile
a list of their clients.

08:20.235 --> 08:22.470
See how...

08:22.504 --> 08:24.938
Popular he was
with his customers.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.540
Where am I going?

08:30.442 --> 08:32.475
Thank you.

08:32.509 --> 08:34.610
While we're at it,
could someone please find out

08:34.644 --> 08:36.379
Why there were
no "shots fired" reports

08:36.413 --> 08:38.215
In the victim's neighborhood
last night?

08:38.249 --> 08:39.082
Thank you.

08:39.116 --> 08:40.451
Chief pope, could you please...

08:40.486 --> 08:41.919
Oh! For heaven's sakes!

08:41.953 --> 08:43.523
I can't move in this place!

08:45.292 --> 08:47.193
Nothing works around here.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.894
nothing!

08:51.431 --> 08:53.531
Read what it says here, will.

08:53.566 --> 08:54.599
"hard interview room."

08:54.633 --> 08:55.967
And what kind of a message

08:56.001 --> 08:57.801
Is that supposed to send
to suspects?

08:57.836 --> 08:59.470
Maybe it's supposed to be
intimidating.

08:59.504 --> 09:02.005
<i>I decide when to intimidate
people around here...</i>

09:02.039 --> 09:03.406
Not the building.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.274
<i>And this... this!</i>

09:05.309 --> 09:07.610
Who over the age of 10
can sit next to this mirror

09:07.644 --> 09:09.444
Without knowing
they're being watched?!

09:09.479 --> 09:10.879
We film people all the time.

09:10.913 --> 09:13.114
<i>Yeah,
but they don't know that!</i>

09:13.148 --> 09:16.283
<i>And even if they do,
they can't see the cameras!</i>

09:18.453 --> 09:22.122
This new building
is an obstacle course.

09:22.156 --> 09:24.523
You've been here five days.

09:24.558 --> 09:26.759
Give the building a chance.

09:26.793 --> 09:28.760
You'll adapt to it.

09:28.794 --> 09:30.828
I promise.

09:30.863 --> 09:33.264
And look... as different
as things might seem,

09:33.298 --> 09:36.366
The really important stuff
hasn't changed at all.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.735
You still have
a murder to work out

09:38.769 --> 09:40.970
And a suspect
you need to interview.

09:41.005 --> 09:42.939
Just stay centered on that,

09:42.973 --> 09:45.274
And everything else
will fall into place.

09:47.043 --> 09:48.510
You'll be okay.

10:07.296 --> 10:09.263
And all his customers, too!

10:09.298 --> 10:10.298
Oh.

10:11.867 --> 10:14.335
I thought you said
this room was empty!

10:18.874 --> 10:21.408
I'm so sorry about that, sir.
I was told this room was vacant.

10:21.443 --> 10:22.409
Who are you, again?

10:22.444 --> 10:24.344
Caleb...Walker.

10:24.379 --> 10:26.646
Caleb Walker.
One second.

10:26.681 --> 10:28.782
It's a Mr. Caleb Walker!

10:31.018 --> 10:33.486
I don't know
about this two-way mirror thing.

10:38.559 --> 10:41.194
I'm so sorry about that,
Mr. Walker.

10:41.228 --> 10:43.462
It's just that we are talking

10:43.497 --> 10:47.132
<i>To all of Mr. Steven Beebe's
customers and neighbors,</i>

10:47.167 --> 10:48.433
<i>And you are both.</i>

10:48.468 --> 10:49.935
<i>Which is why I said yes</i>

10:49.969 --> 10:52.771
<i>When your people asked me
to come down here.</i>

10:52.805 --> 10:56.007
<i>Then I was read my rights
and put in this room.</i>

10:56.041 --> 10:58.476
<i>Is that how you treat people
when they volunteer to help?</i>

10:58.510 --> 10:59.610
No, sir. It isn't.

10:59.645 --> 11:01.445
So let's just honor
your commitment

11:01.480 --> 11:02.613
To being a good citizen

11:02.647 --> 11:04.848
And rush, rush, rush
through these questions.

11:04.883 --> 11:06.616
Um...

11:08.085 --> 11:10.120
Did you hear gunshots
last night?

11:10.154 --> 11:13.156
As I told the other guy,
I wasn't home last night.

11:13.190 --> 11:15.625
I flew in from palm Springs
this morning. Okay?

11:15.659 --> 11:17.459
You already spoke
to someone else?

11:19.095 --> 11:20.896
Where's your form?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.864
Uh...Let's see.

11:22.898 --> 11:25.733
<i>What do we need
to ask you?</i>

11:25.768 --> 11:30.738
<i>Walker, Walker, Walker,
Walker, Walker, Walker...</i>

11:30.772 --> 11:32.072
Oh!

11:32.107 --> 11:34.242
Here you are...
"walker, Caleb."

11:34.276 --> 11:36.210
Um...

11:36.244 --> 11:37.411
Oh, my.

11:37.445 --> 11:39.079
"oh, my" what?

11:39.114 --> 11:40.914
Well, your paperwork is filed

11:40.948 --> 11:43.817
Right next to
a "walker, Cherie,"

11:43.851 --> 11:45.385
Same home address.

11:45.419 --> 11:47.053
Your...

11:47.088 --> 11:48.121
Daughter?

11:49.256 --> 11:51.057
My wife. Why?

11:52.693 --> 11:55.895
Is she about to tell this guy
his wife was cheating on him?

11:55.929 --> 11:58.397
God. Maybe that's why we call it
a "hard interview room."

11:59.566 --> 12:01.933
Well, there's just
no easy way to say this.

12:01.968 --> 12:03.968
Uh, while you were
in palm Springs,

12:04.003 --> 12:07.071
Your wife spent the night
with the victim.

12:09.541 --> 12:11.476
D-did you know
or suspect

12:11.510 --> 12:15.246
That your wife
and your contractor were...

12:15.280 --> 12:17.048
Close?

12:21.885 --> 12:23.552
This is why
you asked me down here

12:23.586 --> 12:25.420
And put me in this room?

12:25.455 --> 12:27.657
To tell me
Cherie had an affair?

12:28.759 --> 12:30.860
See my reaction?

12:30.895 --> 12:32.361
Well...

12:33.897 --> 12:35.364
Here it is.

12:36.599 --> 12:38.633
You're gonna pay
for this little ambush.

12:38.667 --> 12:39.902
And now I'm telling you

12:39.936 --> 12:42.738
<i>And everyone
behind that mirror...</i>

12:44.073 --> 12:47.809
I'm not saying another word
until I get an attorney.

13:00.763 --> 13:02.430
Here, chief.
Let me take that for you.

13:02.464 --> 13:05.133
Thank you so much, commander.

13:08.773 --> 13:10.208
Ah, so, have you heard

13:10.242 --> 13:12.544
From the palm Springs
police department?

13:12.578 --> 13:14.279
Did Walker's alibi hold up?

13:14.313 --> 13:16.881
They sent film of him
boarding a plane to Burbank

13:16.915 --> 13:18.615
Yesterday morning
at 7:00 A.M.

13:18.650 --> 13:20.349
But how good an alibi is that?

13:20.384 --> 13:23.118
He could have driven to L.A.,
shot Mr. Beebe,

13:23.153 --> 13:25.887
Then driven back
in time to make his flight.

13:25.921 --> 13:27.221
On another matter,

13:27.255 --> 13:29.789
Chief Johnson,
do you know that I am

13:29.824 --> 13:32.091
The only person of my rank
who hasn't been assigned

13:32.126 --> 13:33.759
An office
in our new building here?

13:33.793 --> 13:34.860
That's not true.

13:34.894 --> 13:36.495
I've been trying to return
some case files

13:36.529 --> 13:37.862
To commander hood for days,

13:37.897 --> 13:39.897
And his name doesn't show up
on any floor...

13:39.932 --> 13:41.132
He's dead.

13:41.166 --> 13:42.835
Oh! Horrible!
That's terrible.

13:43.870 --> 13:45.069
Massive coronary.

13:45.103 --> 13:48.238
And the office he had went
to the guy who replaced him.

13:48.272 --> 13:50.974
You know, I've been trying
to speak to pope

13:51.009 --> 13:54.577
About where I should go,
but he seems distracted.

13:54.612 --> 13:56.846
Oh, well, you're welcome
to camp out with us for a bit

13:56.880 --> 13:58.113
If you need to, commander.

13:58.147 --> 13:59.114
Thanks.

13:59.148 --> 14:01.716
I, uh...I might
take you up on that.

14:01.750 --> 14:02.950
Oh, that's fine.

14:02.985 --> 14:04.419
Um, I'll put these upstairs.

14:04.453 --> 14:06.120
Thank you.

14:06.154 --> 14:08.489
Boy, the media just can't
get enough of the new building.

14:08.523 --> 14:10.157
I hate it.

14:10.191 --> 14:12.526
Cops aren't happy
unless they're miserable.

14:12.561 --> 14:13.861
Ugh.
God. Look at me.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.096
I...Broke my hand

14:15.130 --> 14:17.566
Helping my daughter
out of a tree in the backyard,

14:17.600 --> 14:20.503
And now, of course, I haven't
been to the gym for weeks.

14:20.537 --> 14:22.404
I feel...Fat.

14:22.439 --> 14:23.906
Do I look fat to you?

14:23.940 --> 14:25.841
I have a murder.
Do you want an update?

14:25.876 --> 14:27.476
Yeah. Yeah.
Tell me everything.

14:29.512 --> 14:30.745
So now I need
ballistics to confirm

14:30.779 --> 14:32.612
That the murder weapon was fired
from the suspect's house

14:32.646 --> 14:34.946
Before I can get a search
warrant for his residence.

14:34.981 --> 14:37.048
<i>But you must have evidence
of some kind.</i>

14:37.082 --> 14:38.883
I mean,
you held Walker overnight.

14:38.917 --> 14:40.684
Did you not hear him
threaten me?

14:40.718 --> 14:43.119
Oh. Right.

14:43.154 --> 14:45.522
well, we can't
arrest everybody who does that.

14:45.556 --> 14:46.756
Very funny.

14:46.791 --> 14:48.959
And Mr. Walker
has motive.

14:51.461 --> 14:53.628
W-well...
Yeah, but...

14:53.662 --> 14:55.963
<i>Only if he knew
his wife was having an affair</i>

14:55.997 --> 14:58.165
Before you told him.

14:58.199 --> 14:59.533
He's also
a retired military officer

14:59.567 --> 15:02.135
And West point graduate,
which means he has experience

15:02.169 --> 15:04.772
With weapons
a-a-and night-vision optics.

15:05.974 --> 15:07.474
What are you doing here?

15:07.508 --> 15:09.276
I'm...

15:09.310 --> 15:12.245
Turning this
into an interview room.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.815
Yeah, but this is
your visitor conference center.

15:14.849 --> 15:17.184
Look, you told me
to adapt to the building.

15:17.218 --> 15:19.753
Chief, I have the
different-colored paint chips

15:19.787 --> 15:21.988
You asked me to get
for the murder room.

15:22.023 --> 15:24.725
I-I'm leaning toward
the, uh, "iceberg"
or the "royal blue."

15:24.759 --> 15:27.563
although, I have to say,

15:27.597 --> 15:30.235
"viridian" is, um...
Awfully nice.

15:30.270 --> 15:31.838
Hmm?

15:31.872 --> 15:33.173
Chief Johnson?

15:33.207 --> 15:34.874
With me. With me.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.747
<i>I asked you
to adapt to the building,</i>

15:41.781 --> 15:43.048
<i>Not adapt
the building to you.</i>

15:43.082 --> 15:45.149
Do you have any idea how much
trouble I've gone through

15:45.184 --> 15:47.084
So that you can have
this state-of-the-art facility?

15:47.118 --> 15:49.285
<i>Oh, yeah, sure.
You did it all for me.</i>

15:49.320 --> 15:51.321
Look, this place
may be state-of-the-art,

15:51.355 --> 15:52.455
But it wasn't designed

15:52.489 --> 15:54.426
By anyone who understands
interrogation.

15:54.460 --> 15:57.998
<i>I'm the resident expert here
on making people talk.</i>

15:58.033 --> 16:00.035
Yeah? Haven't seen
much proof of that lately.

16:04.273 --> 16:06.909
That is completely unfair!
This building is...

16:06.943 --> 16:09.578
A poor workman
always blames his tools.

16:09.612 --> 16:13.282
Parker center
didn't even have caller I.D.

16:13.316 --> 16:15.284
Our new divisional headquarters
is at the cutting edge

16:15.318 --> 16:18.053
Of every law-enforcement
technology in the world.

16:18.088 --> 16:19.655
And I need
for you and major crimes

16:19.689 --> 16:21.256
To fully embrace this place

16:21.291 --> 16:22.624
For at least
the next two months.

16:22.659 --> 16:24.025
Why?
There's gonna be

16:24.060 --> 16:25.693
A big announcement tomorrow
that will make that clear.

16:25.728 --> 16:27.361
In the meantime,
you and your division

16:27.396 --> 16:29.964
Will behave as though this place
were perfect in every way.

16:29.998 --> 16:32.199
"perfect in every way."
really?

16:32.233 --> 16:33.734
Mm-hmm.

16:33.768 --> 16:35.468
What happened to your wall?

16:35.503 --> 16:36.736
Hmm?

16:36.770 --> 16:39.772
There was a wall here last week
when we first moved in.

16:39.807 --> 16:40.940
Where is it?

16:40.974 --> 16:44.244
I had to walk out of my office
to get to my...

16:44.278 --> 16:45.778
Conference room.

16:45.813 --> 16:47.813
Okay. Y...
customize your space.

16:47.848 --> 16:50.950
Just stop blaming the building
for your failures.

16:52.185 --> 16:55.020
Now, have you figured out yet
how Walker knew

16:55.055 --> 16:57.055
The victim was gonna be
on his roof at 4:00 A.M.?

16:59.559 --> 17:02.560
I'm sorry, chief.
I still have no idea.

17:02.594 --> 17:04.594
I'm sure the pictures
from Mr. Beebe's telescope

17:04.627 --> 17:06.395
Are on here...
Somewhere.

17:06.429 --> 17:07.896
I just can't figure out
the password.

17:07.930 --> 17:09.296
I've tried
birthday combinations,

17:09.330 --> 17:11.998
His current and previous
addresses, mother's maiden.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.833
I'm now cycling random words

17:13.867 --> 17:15.299
Through an application
that was given to me...

17:15.334 --> 17:16.333
Tao!

17:16.367 --> 17:17.967
We get the idea, huh?

17:18.935 --> 17:21.001
Uh, chief, Taylor left this, uh,
box of your stuff here.

17:21.036 --> 17:22.301
Oh.

17:22.337 --> 17:24.838
And, uh, Flynn has got Cherie

17:24.872 --> 17:27.173
In our lovely new break room.

17:27.207 --> 17:29.274
Does she not like her hotel?

17:29.308 --> 17:32.144
Her husband's lawyer
called her cell and told her

17:32.178 --> 17:34.312
That we ratted her out
about the affair.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.480
Oh. That.
Right.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.583
Um, tell me, lieutenant...

17:39.617 --> 17:40.884
Uh...

17:40.918 --> 17:44.187
Did I approach Mr. Walker
the wrong way yesterday,

17:44.221 --> 17:45.355
In your opinion?

17:45.389 --> 17:46.589
Come on, chief.

17:46.623 --> 17:49.491
You know, it's just a guy
looking at a two-way mirror,

17:49.525 --> 17:52.360
<i>And he saw someone
who really needed an attorney.</i>

17:52.394 --> 17:54.829
That's all.

17:54.863 --> 17:55.930
Right.

17:55.964 --> 17:58.298
Is that the murder weapon?
An mllo?

17:58.333 --> 18:01.568
A newer model of it, chief.
Semiautomatic.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.103
Developed for military snipers.

18:03.137 --> 18:05.104
It has the best night scope
I've ever seen.

18:05.139 --> 18:08.373
Plus, it has a flash suppressor
and a built-in silencer.

18:08.408 --> 18:10.441
Explains why no one
heard shots fired

18:10.475 --> 18:12.342
On the night of the murder.

18:12.377 --> 18:15.545
Oh, I've had it
with this murder board!

18:16.747 --> 18:18.380
Control thingy!

18:18.415 --> 18:19.614
Chief?

18:19.649 --> 18:21.782
Chief!
What is it?!

18:21.817 --> 18:23.117
Oh. Hello.

18:23.151 --> 18:27.053
These are Mr. Beebe's employees
that you wanted to talk to.

18:27.088 --> 18:30.190
This is Melanie Ryder.
She was his bookkeeper.

18:30.224 --> 18:31.992
This is her husband, Paul...
construction foreman.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.495
They also brought over
the victim's client list,
like you asked for.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.965
Right. Well, thank you so much
for coming in.

18:37.999 --> 18:39.833
pleasure.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.035
Um, why don't we, um,
head into my office?

18:42.070 --> 18:44.337
Right this way.

18:44.371 --> 18:47.706
I'm...So sorry
for your loss.

18:53.578 --> 18:55.746
Oh. My apologies.

18:55.780 --> 18:57.347
We're just moving in here.

18:58.683 --> 19:00.550
Uh, you were saying?

19:00.584 --> 19:02.718
The construction workers
are temps.

19:02.753 --> 19:04.553
We rented all our equipment.

19:04.587 --> 19:07.422
So in terms of full-time
employees, it's just us.

19:07.456 --> 19:09.724
And Mr. Beebe's
business...

19:09.758 --> 19:11.259
How was it doing financially?

19:11.293 --> 19:13.293
He had enough
to make payroll for months,

19:13.328 --> 19:15.996
Except...I wasn't authorized
to sign checks,

19:16.030 --> 19:19.099
<i>So...We can't even
pay ourselves.</i>

19:19.133 --> 19:21.367
On the night
that Steven was murdered,

19:21.402 --> 19:22.969
He went upstairs to his roof

19:23.003 --> 19:25.571
And was looking at something
through his telescope.

19:25.606 --> 19:28.340
Do you have any idea
what that might have been?

19:28.375 --> 19:29.541
Stars?

19:30.643 --> 19:32.377
Steven wasn't a peeping Tom.

19:32.412 --> 19:35.346
Whatever he was looking at,
it was in the sky.

19:35.381 --> 19:37.115
I promise.

19:37.149 --> 19:38.916
It sounds like
you were close to him.

19:40.518 --> 19:41.751
Since High School.

19:42.954 --> 19:44.887
Best friend.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.590
My boss, too, I guess, but...

19:47.624 --> 19:48.857
Friend first.

19:48.892 --> 19:50.926
Did his customers
like him, too?

19:50.960 --> 19:52.261
Usually.

19:52.295 --> 19:54.596
But when you're tearing up
someone's home like that,

19:54.630 --> 19:56.698
Changing the center
of their daily lives,

19:56.732 --> 19:58.132
That causes stress.

19:58.167 --> 20:00.500
<i>It does, doesn't it?</i>

20:03.437 --> 20:05.806
What kind of stress
are we talking about?

20:05.840 --> 20:07.775
A couple of home thefts.

20:07.809 --> 20:10.210
But that's common
at construction sites.

20:10.244 --> 20:11.878
Appliances, tvs...

20:11.913 --> 20:13.881
Our insurance company
replaced or paid

20:13.915 --> 20:15.878
For everything
our clients lost.

20:15.913 --> 20:18.446
Would y'all like some...
Candy?

20:18.480 --> 20:22.315
There's plenty here...
all different kinds, shapes.

20:22.349 --> 20:23.483
Uh, uh, no.

20:23.517 --> 20:24.717
No, thank you, chief.

20:24.752 --> 20:26.318
Sizes.

20:26.353 --> 20:28.620
What about
Steven's romantic life?

20:28.654 --> 20:31.722
Did you ever have
any complaints about that?

20:31.756 --> 20:32.890
For example?

20:32.924 --> 20:35.258
For example,
would you be surprised to hear

20:35.292 --> 20:36.692
That the wife
of one of your clients

20:36.727 --> 20:40.028
Was sleeping in Steven's bed
when he was murdered?

20:40.063 --> 20:42.530
Yeah, we knew
that he'd become...

20:42.564 --> 20:44.665
Closer than he should have
to Cherie Walker.

20:44.699 --> 20:46.533
So maybe her husband knew, too.

20:48.535 --> 20:49.936
Any chance some of the temps

20:49.970 --> 20:52.237
Working at the Walker house
knew about the affair?

20:52.271 --> 20:54.172
I'm sure they did.

20:54.206 --> 20:57.841
Steven could be...
Extremely demonstrative.

20:57.876 --> 21:00.110
He was like a teenager
that way.

21:00.144 --> 21:02.312
You sound a little upset
about that.

21:02.347 --> 21:03.948
This happened a lot.

21:03.982 --> 21:05.416
I-I never
talked to Melanie

21:05.451 --> 21:07.352
About the way Steven behaved
with women until recently

21:07.386 --> 21:09.187
Because I didn't think
she'd be okay with it, really.

21:09.222 --> 21:11.256
<i>You weren't okay with it,
either, Paul.</i>

21:12.658 --> 21:16.029
Look, Steven had
this one character flaw, okay?

21:16.063 --> 21:17.698
He would get infatuated
with someone,

21:17.732 --> 21:20.001
And then for a month or two,
nothing else mattered.

21:20.035 --> 21:21.435
But it wasn't all his fault.

21:22.537 --> 21:24.805
<i>It wasn't just his fault.
Women fell for him.</i>

21:24.839 --> 21:26.473
What was he supposed to do
about that?

21:26.507 --> 21:29.609
Cherie said Mr. Beebe
invited her over to his place

21:29.643 --> 21:31.410
To see the space station?

21:31.445 --> 21:34.346
Yeah. That was
part of Steven's routine.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.447
I think he got more use
out of the space station

21:36.482 --> 21:37.815
Than NASA did.

21:37.850 --> 21:39.383
Okay, you know something?

21:39.418 --> 21:41.652
It is...
it is really infuriating

21:41.686 --> 21:43.053
To hear you talk about him

21:43.088 --> 21:44.721
In this "boys will be boys"
kind of way.

21:44.756 --> 21:46.823
For one thing,
you don't even mean it.

21:46.857 --> 21:49.492
<i>And look at where Steven's
bad behavior has put us.</i>

21:49.526 --> 21:51.193
<i>We could end up
losing everything!</i>

21:52.261 --> 21:53.895
everything.

21:53.929 --> 21:55.430
Chief?
Yes?

21:58.667 --> 22:00.234
Ballistics says
the murder weapon

22:00.268 --> 22:02.335
Could have been fired
from the walkers' house.

22:02.370 --> 22:03.870
I have our search warrant.

22:14.481 --> 22:16.982
Please don't tear up
everything we just had built.

22:17.016 --> 22:18.783
It cost a fortune.

22:18.817 --> 22:20.484
Chief, look at this path.

22:20.519 --> 22:22.820
Someone wiped away
their tracks.

22:24.622 --> 22:27.090
Think this rifle mount
might help?

22:27.124 --> 22:29.225
Found it
next to the water cooler.

22:36.465 --> 22:37.565
Hold up the dummy.

22:44.204 --> 22:45.604
Okay, chief.

22:45.639 --> 22:47.840
I have a clear line of sight
to our victim's house.

22:50.777 --> 22:52.477
<i>You could make
this shot.</i>

22:52.512 --> 22:54.579
With a steady hand
and a little practice,

22:54.614 --> 22:56.114
<i>Even she could do it.</i>

22:56.148 --> 22:58.049
Not without this weapon.

22:58.083 --> 22:59.550
Gentlemen,
let's see if we can find

22:59.584 --> 23:02.052
A rifle just like this one
on the premises.

23:02.087 --> 23:04.054
And some casings
would be great, too.

23:04.088 --> 23:06.055
Uh, maybe you could, like,
go on keeping me

23:06.089 --> 23:07.456
As a protected witness, too.

23:07.490 --> 23:08.723
Don't you worry, Cherie.

23:08.758 --> 23:10.859
I have no intention
of letting you go anywhere.

23:18.729 --> 23:21.297
<i>And you've been having an affair
for how long?</i>

23:21.332 --> 23:22.632
Less than a month.

23:22.666 --> 23:25.267
But I-I sort of fell into it
because you've been away a lot.

23:25.302 --> 23:26.602
So I want to kill you?

23:26.636 --> 23:27.769
No, not me...
my boyfriend.

23:27.804 --> 23:28.937
<i>Why not the both of you?</i>

23:28.971 --> 23:31.039
Because we were on the roof
together for a while,

23:31.073 --> 23:32.940
But you waited
until my boyfriend was alone

23:32.975 --> 23:33.975
To shoot him.

23:34.009 --> 23:36.043
Are you sure
my motive is jealousy,

23:36.077 --> 23:39.747
Not...Irritation
that everything you promised me

23:39.781 --> 23:40.982
You would bring
to your new office

23:41.016 --> 23:43.019
Is still boxed up here?

23:43.053 --> 23:46.956
It's not my fault!
I park blocks from where I work!

23:46.991 --> 23:49.058
<i>And you don't want
to kill me, anyway.</i>

23:49.093 --> 23:50.793
You want to kill my boyfriend.

23:50.828 --> 23:52.127
I certainly do.

23:53.329 --> 23:55.230
So...

23:55.265 --> 23:57.132
<i>I don't blame you
for the affair.</i>

23:57.167 --> 23:59.001
I have to blame
the guy who seduced you.

23:59.035 --> 24:00.402
That's right.

24:00.437 --> 24:02.304
But just so you know,
I'd never blame the other woman.

24:02.339 --> 24:04.473
<i>It'd be your fault,
100%.</i>

24:04.507 --> 24:05.841
Who's the killer here...
me or you?

24:05.875 --> 24:07.776
You, you, you.
Sorry. Go ahead.

24:07.810 --> 24:09.943
Now, jealousy can provoke
a crime of passion,

24:09.977 --> 24:12.176
But it can also arrive
in stages,

24:12.211 --> 24:13.843
Like grief...

24:13.877 --> 24:16.145
Shock, denial...

24:16.179 --> 24:17.446
Rage.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.414
Followed by
gunshots to the head.

24:19.448 --> 24:22.283
<i>from a sniper rifle
I still can't find.</i>

24:22.317 --> 24:25.118
Oh, Joel.
Which indicates planning
on my part

24:25.152 --> 24:27.253
And that I'm hoping
to get away with it.

24:27.287 --> 24:30.255
So, how did I react when you
first told me about the affair?

24:30.289 --> 24:32.690
Was I cool, calm,
and collected, or...

24:32.725 --> 24:35.359
Did I drag all your boxes
into the driveway

24:35.393 --> 24:36.827
And put a hose to them?

24:36.862 --> 24:37.928
Oh, don't do that.

24:37.963 --> 24:40.131
I've been faithful to you
in every way.

24:40.165 --> 24:41.699
Mm.

24:41.733 --> 24:44.869
Well, I'm the forgiving type,
but what about your suspect?

24:44.904 --> 24:48.506
Is he a crime-of-passion
kind of guy?

24:48.541 --> 24:50.542
Or...

24:50.576 --> 24:53.846
Was he cold and calculating?

24:53.880 --> 24:56.115
<i>And how did he know</i>

24:56.149 --> 24:59.852
Your victim was gonna go back up
on the roof at 4:00 A.M.?

25:01.455 --> 25:04.156
'cause somehow he knew

25:04.190 --> 25:06.424
What Mr. Beebe
was going to be looking at

25:06.459 --> 25:07.725
Through his telescope.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.327
And do you have any idea
what that might have been?

25:10.361 --> 25:13.696
The constellation
of Sagittarius.

25:13.731 --> 25:15.231
In particular, the milky way.

25:15.266 --> 25:17.667
Hundreds of thousands of stars

25:17.701 --> 25:19.868
Crammed together
at the center of the galaxy,

25:19.902 --> 25:21.469
Shining brightest
in north America

25:21.503 --> 25:23.204
During the months
of July and August.

25:23.238 --> 25:25.739
I-in fact,
during a recent g...

25:25.774 --> 25:27.575
Thank you, Dr. Sagan!

25:27.609 --> 25:30.578
Can you please just
scroll through the photos?

25:30.612 --> 25:32.915
We're looking for
something incriminating here,

25:32.949 --> 25:36.718
Like a picture of Walker
aiming a gun at the victim.

25:36.753 --> 25:39.821
How did you find the password
to the victim's computer?

25:39.855 --> 25:41.322
Mr. Beebe's foreman
told us

25:41.356 --> 25:43.424
Whenever he became infatuated
with someone,

25:43.458 --> 25:45.360
She took over
as the focus of his life.

25:45.394 --> 25:47.662
He changed his password
to "Cherie"?

25:47.696 --> 25:50.098
<i>Mr. Beebe
really was a teenager.</i>

25:51.800 --> 25:54.435
So, the milky way is brightest
over the next two months,

25:54.470 --> 25:56.137
But that's not specific
to the night of the murder.

25:57.139 --> 25:59.207
<i>I-it is, actually,
'cause normally,</i>

25:59.242 --> 26:01.443
Mr. Beebe couldn't take pictures
from his house

26:01.478 --> 26:03.211
Because the ambient light
from the city

26:03.245 --> 26:04.445
Would wash out the stars.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.546
Right,
but because of the recession,

26:06.580 --> 26:08.547
L.A. Has been
turning off the streetlights

26:08.581 --> 26:10.950
In different neighborhoods
two hours before sunrise.

26:10.984 --> 26:12.317
The night of the murder,

26:12.352 --> 26:15.185
Mr. Beebe's neighborhood
went dark at exactly 3:58 A.M.

26:17.119 --> 26:20.118
Oh, lieutenant Flynn!
A usable murder board!

26:20.152 --> 26:21.118
Thank you so much!

26:21.153 --> 26:22.319
Let's get everything on it

26:22.353 --> 26:23.586
While the other one
is still down.

26:25.054 --> 26:28.623
<i>Mr. Beebe
was looking at the stars.</i>

26:28.657 --> 26:31.959
<i>And he changed his password
to "Cherie."</i>

26:31.993 --> 26:33.627
What does that mean?

26:33.662 --> 26:36.364
It means I really need
to question Caleb Walker again.

26:36.398 --> 26:38.299
Well,
you're gonna have to settle

26:38.333 --> 26:39.801
For interviewing his attorney,

26:39.835 --> 26:43.269
Who's waiting for you
in our new break room.

26:44.304 --> 26:45.436
Chief, you mind if I, uh,

26:45.471 --> 26:47.136
Park in your conference room
for a while?

26:47.170 --> 26:48.804
No, commander Taylor.

26:48.838 --> 26:51.205
Go ahead.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.574
Thank you.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.048
All right, gentlemen.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.750
Gentlemen,
now that we have located

27:02.784 --> 27:04.151
The center of the galaxy,

27:04.185 --> 27:06.086
I really want to find
that murder weapon.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.288
Let's run every name
connected to this case,

27:08.322 --> 27:10.089
Including those
of Mr. Beebe's clients.

27:10.123 --> 27:13.792
See if anyone is registered
as owning an mllo rifle.

27:13.826 --> 27:15.660
Thank you so much.

27:15.694 --> 27:17.095
And if someone
could please find out

27:17.129 --> 27:19.430
Where commander Taylor's office
is supposed to be,

27:19.464 --> 27:20.631
I'd really appreciate it.

27:20.665 --> 27:21.932
Thank you so much.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.034
Chief?
Yes?

27:24.068 --> 27:25.068
Break room.

27:26.003 --> 27:28.170
The break room is...
That way.

27:28.205 --> 27:30.339
Oh.

27:30.373 --> 27:32.573
All right, people.
You heard her.

27:32.608 --> 27:34.842
Let's hop to it.

27:34.876 --> 27:36.576
Mr. Walker
wants to go home,

27:36.611 --> 27:38.745
And he also wants
to talk to his wife.

27:38.779 --> 27:40.480
Cherie asked for protection.

27:40.514 --> 27:42.481
If Mr. Walker
wants to see his wife,

27:42.515 --> 27:43.848
He needs to convince me
he's not a threat.

27:43.883 --> 27:45.183
Nice try, Johnson.

27:45.217 --> 27:47.884
But Walker is never talking
to you again in a billion years.

27:49.387 --> 27:51.021
What do you want
to ask him, anyway?

27:51.055 --> 27:53.456
Honestly, Mr. Murdoch,
at this point,

27:53.490 --> 27:56.491
I only want to eliminate
Mr. Walker as a suspect.

27:56.526 --> 27:59.059
You're supposed to be one of
the greatest liars of all time,

27:59.094 --> 28:00.527
And that's the best you can do?

28:00.561 --> 28:02.028
Really?

28:02.062 --> 28:04.329
Hm. Okay.

28:04.364 --> 28:07.366
So, what makes Walker a suspect
to begin with?

28:07.400 --> 28:08.534
Including motive,

28:08.569 --> 28:10.337
Mr. Beebe was shot
from your client's terrace.

28:10.371 --> 28:12.541
While Walker
was in palm Springs.

28:12.576 --> 28:14.877
We found a rifle mount behind
the water cooler in his house.

28:14.911 --> 28:16.812
Right... so, let's go
back over every murder

28:16.846 --> 28:19.214
Since the invention of gunpowder
and see how many people

28:19.248 --> 28:20.915
Were shot to death
with rifle mounts.

28:22.852 --> 28:24.619
I'm betting less than one.

28:26.222 --> 28:27.455
Come on, Johnson.

28:27.490 --> 28:30.225
You had a good crack at Walker,
and you blew it.

28:30.259 --> 28:31.593
His alibi will stand,

28:31.627 --> 28:33.828
You don't have any evidence
to charge him for murder,

28:33.863 --> 28:36.064
And he's not gonna
talk to you ever again.

28:36.098 --> 28:38.733
And how you're gonna
get around all that...

28:38.767 --> 28:41.035
Gosh, I'd love to know.

28:43.605 --> 28:45.906
Letting Caleb go home
makes me feel like

28:45.940 --> 28:47.841
He could be innocent, I guess.

28:47.875 --> 28:51.043
But I'm not sure I feel safe
trying to make up with him.

28:51.078 --> 28:53.612
Well, that's why we're
wiring you up, sweetheart...

28:53.646 --> 28:54.780
So you can feel safe.

28:54.814 --> 28:56.581
<i>And the minute
you don't feel safe,</i>

28:56.616 --> 28:59.751
Just say the word "cinnamon,"
and we'll be right there.

28:59.785 --> 29:02.386
Cinnamon. Cinnamon.
Cinnamon.

29:02.420 --> 29:04.154
Now, listen to me, Cherie...
it's very important

29:04.188 --> 29:05.589
That you try
and reconcile with Caleb,

29:05.623 --> 29:07.156
Because if I can't
put him away for murder,

29:07.191 --> 29:09.826
<i>He probably would get
everything in a divorce.</i>

29:11.028 --> 29:13.096
Like, even the house?

29:13.130 --> 29:15.064
Mm-hmm.

29:15.099 --> 29:18.500
But don't you worry
about helping me convict him.

29:18.535 --> 29:20.101
Just say you're sorry,

29:20.136 --> 29:22.170
And we'll see
how he reacts, okay?

29:22.204 --> 29:23.938
Wow. Okay.

29:23.972 --> 29:26.106
Synonym.
Uh... synonym.

29:26.140 --> 29:27.607
Cimenin.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.509
Salt!
Just...Say salt.

29:30.543 --> 29:31.510
Okay?

29:31.544 --> 29:32.544
Salt.

29:32.578 --> 29:33.545
Okay.
Okay.

29:33.579 --> 29:34.545
There you go.

29:34.580 --> 29:35.546
Thank you.

29:35.581 --> 29:37.047
Be careful.

29:37.082 --> 29:38.348
Bye, now.

29:38.383 --> 29:40.917
Chief...

29:40.952 --> 29:42.485
I thought you said
wiring up Cherie

29:42.520 --> 29:43.886
And sending her to her husband

29:43.921 --> 29:45.788
Was the most irresponsible thing
we could do.

29:45.822 --> 29:46.789
At that moment.

29:46.823 --> 29:47.889
I said, at that moment,

29:47.924 --> 29:49.858
It was the most irresponsible
thing to do.

29:49.893 --> 29:51.460
<i>Now we're at
a different moment.</i>

29:51.494 --> 29:55.363
And I have no other way
of getting Walker to talk.

29:55.398 --> 29:57.298
<i>Salt.</i>

29:57.332 --> 29:58.699
Salt. Salt. Salt.

29:58.733 --> 29:59.733
Salt.

30:04.071 --> 30:05.706
Caleb?

30:07.909 --> 30:10.043
Caleb, are you here?

30:15.485 --> 30:18.156
Caleb? Where are you?

30:18.191 --> 30:19.960
Caleb?

30:26.836 --> 30:28.936
<i>I'm sorry about what
happened to your boyfriend.</i>

30:28.970 --> 30:32.103
He... he wasn't
my boyfriend, Caleb.

30:32.137 --> 30:33.536
Let me explain.

30:34.870 --> 30:37.136
What's to explain?

30:37.170 --> 30:38.603
You fell in love
with somebody else,

30:38.638 --> 30:39.603
And it didn't work out.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.638
Now you want to come back home.

30:41.672 --> 30:43.240
Chief, I don't like this.

30:43.274 --> 30:45.075
No, no, no. She hasn't said
the safeword yet.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.011
<i>What happened
between Steven and me...</i>

30:47.046 --> 30:48.546
It wasn't love.

30:48.580 --> 30:49.747
What was it?

30:50.816 --> 30:52.016
Just sex?
Is that it?

30:52.050 --> 30:53.017
No.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.084
I mean, yes!

30:54.119 --> 30:55.419
I mean...

30:55.454 --> 30:57.421
I-it was just
a moment of weakness.

30:57.456 --> 31:01.158
And I promise you, it will
never, ever happen again.

31:04.729 --> 31:06.396
You're right.

31:07.698 --> 31:09.699
It won't.

31:09.733 --> 31:10.867
Aah!

31:10.901 --> 31:12.635
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

31:15.605 --> 31:17.371
Cimenin!

31:17.405 --> 31:18.705
Cinnamon!

31:18.740 --> 31:21.408
Salt!

31:21.442 --> 31:22.675
Salt!

31:22.709 --> 31:23.943
Salt!

31:23.977 --> 31:25.711
Salt!

31:25.745 --> 31:27.379
Salt!

31:27.413 --> 31:29.847
Let her go!
Let her go, sir!

31:29.882 --> 31:31.716
You, let her go now,
or I'm gonna shoot you dead!

31:31.750 --> 31:32.883
I will shoot you dead!

31:32.917 --> 31:34.184
You keep your hands
where I can see them!

31:34.218 --> 31:35.418
Okay.

31:35.453 --> 31:38.388
Keep 'em where I can see 'em!
Get up! Get up!

31:38.422 --> 31:39.756
Put your hands
behind your back.

31:39.790 --> 31:41.223
Caleb Walker,
you are under arrest

31:41.258 --> 31:42.791
For the attempted murder
of your wife.

31:42.825 --> 31:44.658
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:44.692 --> 31:46.659
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

31:46.693 --> 31:47.893
In a court of law.

31:47.927 --> 31:49.027
You have the right
to an attorney.

31:49.062 --> 31:50.362
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

31:50.396 --> 31:52.364
One will be appointed to you
by the state.

31:52.398 --> 31:54.466
Have you heard and understood
these rights?

31:54.500 --> 31:57.469
He... he...
he tried to kill me!

31:57.503 --> 32:00.372
Yes, he did, didn't he?

32:33.099 --> 32:34.099
Oh!

32:36.970 --> 32:39.304
Welcome to what used to be
our multimedia center.

32:39.338 --> 32:42.305
<i>Oh! This is much bigger
than our old electronics room.</i>

32:42.340 --> 32:44.571
We could have
video-conferenced in here

32:44.605 --> 32:46.538
With other divisions, citywide.

32:46.572 --> 32:49.341
But did we need to do that,
lieutenant really?

32:49.375 --> 32:51.409
No, but
it would have been cool.

32:51.443 --> 32:54.044
We can still use
every video feed we have.

32:54.079 --> 32:56.146
And I'll be all set up
to record

32:56.180 --> 32:57.380
In about five minutes.

32:57.415 --> 32:59.582
What the hell is going on here?

32:59.616 --> 33:02.618
Look... not everyone
is as blindly in love

33:02.652 --> 33:04.620
<i>With this new building
as you are.</i>

33:04.654 --> 33:07.355
And I... I have an obligation
to the justice system

33:07.390 --> 33:10.158
That supersedes your desire
to keep this headquarters

33:10.192 --> 33:11.692
As some kind of a monument
to your...

33:11.727 --> 33:13.527
I meant, what's going on
with Caleb Walker?

33:14.796 --> 33:16.229
Oh. That.

33:16.264 --> 33:17.597
Yes... that.

33:17.631 --> 33:19.798
You wired his wife and sent her
in to speak with him.

33:19.833 --> 33:23.000
That's a clear violation
of his Miranda rights.

33:23.034 --> 33:24.568
No, it wasn't.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.737
Cherie was cautioned
against asking her husband

33:26.771 --> 33:28.071
Anything about the murder.

33:28.106 --> 33:30.140
The wire was only there
to ensure her safety.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.808
She was
nearly strangled to death.

33:31.842 --> 33:33.876
She'll live.
What are you doing here, anyway?

33:33.911 --> 33:35.945
I thought you had
some huge announcement to make.

33:35.979 --> 33:37.280
And I'm trying to make sure

33:37.314 --> 33:39.315
It doesn't turn into a list
of apologies from major crimes.

33:39.349 --> 33:40.316
It won't.

33:40.350 --> 33:41.584
Lieutenant tao,
would you please

33:41.618 --> 33:42.852
Bring in the victim's computer?

33:42.886 --> 33:44.987
Detective Sanchez?

33:48.224 --> 33:50.025
Let's pretend
the wire was legal.

33:50.059 --> 33:52.594
So far, you've only charged
Walker with attempted murder.

33:52.628 --> 33:54.862
Why haven't you arrested him
for killing Steven Beebe?

33:54.897 --> 33:56.464
Well, for one thing,
he had an alibi.

33:56.498 --> 33:57.765
You didn't care about that
yesterday.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.767
Well, now it helps me
make my case.

33:59.802 --> 34:01.436
I thought your case was made

34:01.470 --> 34:03.304
When Walker
tried to kill Cherie.

34:03.338 --> 34:04.539
Yes.

34:04.573 --> 34:06.674
He wanted his wife dead,
and he's a killer,

34:06.708 --> 34:08.641
But not the type
to off Steven Beebe.

34:08.677 --> 34:09.844
T-the gun was fired
from his house.

34:09.878 --> 34:11.378
<i>It was,
but not by him.</i>

34:11.413 --> 34:13.179
Okay, what am I missing here?

34:13.214 --> 34:14.947
the murder weapon!

34:14.983 --> 34:17.351
And, unfortunately,
I still can't find it.

34:17.385 --> 34:18.652
<i>But I do know
where it came from.</i>

34:18.687 --> 34:21.088
Detective Sanchez,
fill chief pope in, please.

34:23.424 --> 34:25.958
A civilian version of the mllo
was stolen from a house

34:25.994 --> 34:28.062
Mr. Beebe remodeled
four months ago, sir.

34:28.096 --> 34:29.730
And during that same robbery,

34:29.764 --> 34:31.731
The thief also took
this microwave oven.

34:31.766 --> 34:35.833
And, from the crime scene,
the victim's laptop.

34:35.869 --> 34:38.737
Whenever Mr. Beebe
became infatuated with someone,

34:38.771 --> 34:40.906
He changed all the passwords
on his computers

34:40.940 --> 34:42.474
To his new girlfriend's name.

34:44.342 --> 34:45.342
Cherie.

34:46.279 --> 34:47.980
She had access to the terrace,

34:48.014 --> 34:49.815
And her husband
was out of town.

34:49.849 --> 34:51.817
But how could Cherie
have stolen a rifle

34:51.851 --> 34:53.452
From one of
Mr. Beebe's clients

34:53.485 --> 34:55.085
Months before she even met him?

34:55.120 --> 34:57.488
No... the relevant fact here
is that the victim

34:57.523 --> 35:00.758
<i>Changed the login password
on his computer to her name,</i>

35:00.792 --> 35:02.559
Which made me wonder...

35:02.594 --> 35:05.130
What had the password been
before?

35:14.775 --> 35:16.743
He used my wife's name
as a password.

35:18.112 --> 35:20.079
I don't know what you think
that's supposed to mean.

35:20.114 --> 35:21.447
Yes, you do, sir.

35:21.482 --> 35:24.083
It means your wife had an affair
with your best friend.

35:25.185 --> 35:26.452
That's a lie.

35:26.486 --> 35:28.487
<i>It's not a lie,
and you know it's not.</i>

35:30.791 --> 35:33.459
Are you trying to get me to say
something bad about Melanie?

35:33.493 --> 35:36.462
That's not legal,
for one thing.

35:36.496 --> 35:40.466
And she'd never have had...
Sex with Steven, either.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.201
Not only did she have sex
with Steven,

35:42.235 --> 35:43.469
She was in love with him.

35:43.503 --> 35:46.438
I mean,
would you like me to read aloud

35:46.473 --> 35:48.173
From the e-mail account
Melanie set up

35:48.207 --> 35:50.108
To communicate with Steven
behind your back?

35:50.143 --> 35:52.610
Because I could start
with the e-mail she sent

35:52.645 --> 35:54.813
Warning him
that you had found her phone

35:54.847 --> 35:57.582
And looked at the text messages
they were sending each other.

35:57.616 --> 35:59.784
And, of course, you had access
to the Walker house

35:59.818 --> 36:01.652
Because you were renovating
their terrace.

36:01.687 --> 36:03.754
But most importantly, sir,

36:03.789 --> 36:06.290
You knew how fascinated
your friend was with the stars.

36:06.324 --> 36:07.758
How excited was he

36:07.793 --> 36:10.327
About the lights going out
in his neighborhood?

36:10.361 --> 36:11.495
<i>I bet very.</i>

36:11.529 --> 36:13.997
Enough, maybe,
to tell you about it?

36:14.031 --> 36:15.565
And then there was the theft

36:15.599 --> 36:17.166
You reported
a couple months ago

36:17.200 --> 36:18.800
From a house
you were remodeling.

36:18.835 --> 36:21.035
And among the items listed
as having been stolen

36:21.070 --> 36:22.169
Was a rifle...

36:22.204 --> 36:24.338
Just like the one used
to kill Mr. Beebe.

36:24.372 --> 36:25.338
No.

36:25.373 --> 36:27.040
We fired all the employees

36:27.074 --> 36:29.108
Responsible
for taking that stuff.

36:29.142 --> 36:30.176
<i>All that stuff?</i>

36:30.210 --> 36:31.977
We went to a house
that you renovated

36:32.011 --> 36:33.645
Soon after
this so-called "theft,"

36:33.679 --> 36:35.581
And look at what we found
in the kitchen.

36:35.615 --> 36:37.783
It's the microwave you listed
on the insurance claim

36:37.818 --> 36:39.252
As having been stolen.

36:39.286 --> 36:40.487
Know how we can tell?

36:40.521 --> 36:43.024
Because of the serial number,
right here.

36:43.058 --> 36:45.128
That microwave
gave me a search warrant

36:45.163 --> 36:47.865
For your house, your car,
and everything else you own.

36:47.899 --> 36:49.300
<i>So while
we're sitting here,</i>

36:49.334 --> 36:51.702
<i>My entire squad is out
looking for that murder weapon,</i>

36:51.736 --> 36:53.470
<i>And when they find
that rifle,</i>

36:53.505 --> 36:55.639
I won't need to hear
what you have to say anymore.

36:57.342 --> 36:59.609
Now, you've been read
your rights, Paul.

36:59.644 --> 37:01.111
And while
we still have the chance,

37:01.145 --> 37:03.313
I want to know
your side of things.

37:06.217 --> 37:08.752
You've watched your best friend
pull his little routine

37:08.786 --> 37:10.620
On lots of dumb girls.

37:12.123 --> 37:15.191
Must have been agony to find out
your wife was one of them.

37:17.128 --> 37:18.661
You have no idea.

37:18.696 --> 37:21.965
But you didn't file for divorce.
You didn't quit your job.

37:21.999 --> 37:25.201
Help me to understand
why you didn't just walk away.

37:26.670 --> 37:30.006
You mean, why didn't I
just rip up my whole life...

37:30.040 --> 37:34.343
Give up my job, my house,
my savings?

37:36.113 --> 37:39.215
You answer this, lady...
you're so smart.

37:40.784 --> 37:42.818
Why should I be punished

37:42.853 --> 37:46.789
Because my wife and best friend
had an affair?

37:46.823 --> 37:51.293
Why should I be made to pay
for their bad behavior?

37:52.629 --> 37:54.597
How is that right?

37:57.767 --> 38:00.769
You stole that rifle
months before you ever used it,

38:00.804 --> 38:02.704
So you must have tried
to forgive them.

38:02.739 --> 38:05.207
Well...

38:05.241 --> 38:07.342
I loved them, didn't I?

38:09.712 --> 38:13.515
And I did think...
Just for a moment...

38:13.549 --> 38:16.551
When Steven took up with Cherie
that Melanie might...

38:18.988 --> 38:22.591
See him for what he was.

38:22.625 --> 38:26.628
But...It only
made things worse.

38:26.662 --> 38:28.797
And then...

38:28.831 --> 38:30.098
And then...

38:30.133 --> 38:31.466
And then Steven told me

38:31.501 --> 38:34.102
That he was gonna show Cherie
the space station.

38:35.504 --> 38:38.873
He had this...
this smile.

38:40.643 --> 38:43.611
And I thought,
"son of a bitch."

38:45.814 --> 38:50.184
That's the way he smiled
right before he screwed my wife.

38:51.787 --> 38:53.287
So you took
this one opportunity

38:53.322 --> 38:55.823
Where you knew Steven
would be alone on his roof

38:55.858 --> 38:57.925
And Cherie's house
would be empty.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.293
And you left
just enough evidence

38:59.328 --> 39:00.728
For us to think
the husband did it,

39:00.762 --> 39:04.398
<i>But not enough evidence
for us to arrest him.</i>

39:06.302 --> 39:08.369
Is that right?

39:08.404 --> 39:09.404
Paul?

39:11.540 --> 39:13.341
That's right.

39:13.375 --> 39:16.577
See? The new building works
just as well as the old one.

39:16.612 --> 39:18.312
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

39:18.347 --> 39:19.847
I think you'll be interested

39:19.882 --> 39:22.183
In the press conference
I'm about to have.

39:24.053 --> 39:26.554
And murdering your best friend?

39:26.589 --> 39:28.323
Did it make things any better?

39:30.092 --> 39:32.793
Well...

39:32.828 --> 39:34.830
They're certainly
not any worse.

39:49.148 --> 39:51.048
Hey, guys,
why the hell is Taylor

39:51.083 --> 39:53.484
Using Brenda's conference room
as an office?

39:53.518 --> 39:54.752
Um...

39:54.786 --> 39:57.187
You know, chief Johnson
had a very similar question,

39:57.222 --> 39:59.657
So I looked at the building's
original plans, and...

39:59.691 --> 40:00.691
The space was...

40:00.726 --> 40:03.361
It's Taylor's office.
Just say it.

40:03.395 --> 40:04.495
What?

40:04.529 --> 40:06.364
Well, the building
was designed 10 years ago,

40:06.398 --> 40:08.465
Long before major crimes
ever came into existence.

40:08.500 --> 40:12.336
And the commander in charge
of coordinating with divisions,

40:12.370 --> 40:15.206
Which is...
Taylor's job,

40:15.240 --> 40:16.841
<i>Is supposed to be
in here.</i>

40:16.875 --> 40:20.044
Oh, my God!

40:20.078 --> 40:21.312
Has anyone told Taylor?

40:21.346 --> 40:22.446
No.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.614
And we didn't want to tell
the chief, either.

40:24.649 --> 40:27.014
But we, you know, talked
about it amongst ourselves

40:27.049 --> 40:28.781
<i>And thought
that maybe you could...</i>

40:28.815 --> 40:30.715
<i>I can't tell her.
Fritzi.</i>

40:30.749 --> 40:31.982
Oh!

40:32.016 --> 40:34.650
How sweet of y'all to lug
my stuff all the way up here.

40:34.684 --> 40:36.851
And what is it
you can't tell me?

40:36.886 --> 40:38.519
What is it I can't tell you?

40:41.189 --> 40:44.925
Why...Everyone is headed
into your conference room.

40:46.594 --> 40:48.662
Oh!
The big announcement.

40:51.965 --> 40:54.900
<i>And the city
can be very proud.</i>

40:54.935 --> 40:57.235
<i>We have lowered crime
in Los Angeles.</i>

40:57.270 --> 40:59.637
<i>We have increased respect
for the justice system.</i>

40:59.672 --> 41:01.539
<i>And now that
he has safely supervised</i>

41:01.573 --> 41:03.240
<i>The transition
of our department</i>

41:03.275 --> 41:05.175
<i>Into the most
technologically advanced</i>

41:05.210 --> 41:07.411
<i>Law enforcement facility
in the world,</i>

41:07.445 --> 41:09.413
<i>Chief of police
Edward j. Thompson</i>

41:09.447 --> 41:12.082
<i>Would like to make
an announcement.</i>

41:12.116 --> 41:13.082
<i>Thanks, will.</i>

41:13.117 --> 41:14.350
<i>For most of the last decade,</i>

41:14.385 --> 41:17.586
<i>I've been privileged
to serve as your chief.</i>

41:17.621 --> 41:19.555
Good God.

41:19.589 --> 41:22.424
The old bastard
is finally going to resign.

41:22.458 --> 41:24.425
<i>Shh!
The men and women
of the l.A.P.D.</i>

41:24.460 --> 41:26.226
<i>Have made this city
a safer place for everyone.</i>

41:26.261 --> 41:27.895
So, that's
the big announcement, huh?

41:27.929 --> 41:29.229
We're getting a new chief.

41:29.264 --> 41:30.931
<i>...To love
the people we serve...</i>

41:30.965 --> 41:32.465
Who do you think it's gonna be?

41:32.499 --> 41:33.866
Oh, I think we already know.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.268
Do you really think
that will...

41:36.302 --> 41:40.104
Chief pope is going to take over
the...Entire department?

41:40.138 --> 41:41.405
I do.

41:41.439 --> 41:43.507
<i>And from the look on his face,
so does he.</i>

41:43.541 --> 41:46.209
<i>It's been
a joyous 32 years.</i>

41:46.243 --> 41:49.078
<i>That's why he loves
this building so much.</i>

41:49.357 --> 41:51.957
He thinks it's his.

41:51.958 --> 41:52.179
