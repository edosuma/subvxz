00:02.043 --> 00:03.810
Hey, liz, my daughter's
selling valentine cookies

00:03.878 --> 00:04.811
For a school fundraiser.

00:04.879 --> 00:06.112
Valentine's day is a sham

00:06.180 --> 00:07.881
Created by card companies
to reinforce and exploit

00:07.949 --> 00:09.182
Gender stereotypes.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.951
Evelyn, this is the lady
I was telling you about.

00:12.019 --> 00:15.788
I like valentine's day.
Tommy reticker gave me a card.

00:15.856 --> 00:18.591
Ha. Learn from my sexual
misadventures, evelyn.

00:18.659 --> 00:19.892
Last valentine's day,

00:19.960 --> 00:21.627
I watched my boyfriend drew's

00:21.695 --> 00:23.929
Mother/grandmother die.

00:23.997 --> 00:26.932
I met floyd on valentine's day,

00:27.000 --> 00:28.734
But he left me for the ty of cleveland.

00:28.802 --> 00:30.136
And forget about dennis!

00:30.203 --> 00:31.537
That pervert would always
just try to get me drunk--

00:31.605 --> 00:32.972
All right, so zero cookies.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.573
No, I'll buy some cookies.

00:34.641 --> 00:36.575
But not for valentine's day.

00:36.643 --> 00:39.211
Instead, these cookies celebrate

00:39.279 --> 00:40.913
The February 14th birthday

00:40.981 --> 00:44.250
Of anna howard shaw,
famed american suffragette.

00:44.318 --> 00:46.652
Happy anna howard shaw day to you, evelyn.

00:46.720 --> 00:47.820
Come on.

00:47.888 --> 00:50.990
A happy anna howard shaw day to us all!

00:54.027 --> 01:02.068
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:10.077 --> 01:12.478
Lemon, which one of these ties
do you find more attractive?

01:12.546 --> 01:15.581
- The red, definitely.
- Thank you.

01:15.649 --> 01:16.916
I've got to look camera ready tonight.

01:16.983 --> 01:18.017
I'm being interviewed on cnbc.

01:18.085 --> 01:19.151
Have you ever watched

01:19.219 --> 01:21.153
<i>The hot box with avery jessup?</i>

01:21.221 --> 01:22.688
No, cnbc gives me a headache.

01:22.756 --> 01:25.358
I get all my money advice from pbs.

01:25.425 --> 01:26.692
Where should I put my money:

01:26.760 --> 01:29.295
In tech stocks or the housing market?

01:29.363 --> 01:33.966
Tech stocks, foxy moneybags, tech stocks!

01:34.034 --> 01:37.136
Sir, your reservations are
all set for valentine's day.

01:37.204 --> 01:39.305
And just to be clear,
are you and I exchanging--

01:39.373 --> 01:41.474
No.

01:41.541 --> 01:42.742
Why do you have valentine's plans?

01:42.809 --> 01:44.143
What about nancy?

01:44.211 --> 01:46.645
Nancy knows that I'm here when she's ready.

01:46.713 --> 01:48.814
But after what we went through,
our marriage,

01:48.882 --> 01:50.483
The way that it ended between us,

01:50.550 --> 01:52.818
It was, uh, very intense.

01:52.886 --> 01:54.487
Like when you think there's one more stair,

01:54.554 --> 01:55.755
But there isn't.

01:55.822 --> 01:57.289
And all of the sudden, you're, like, "whoa!"

01:57.357 --> 01:58.424
Exactly.

01:58.492 --> 02:00.493
So for now, I just want
something fun and easy.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.262
Frankly, I could use a win. - A win?

02:03.330 --> 02:04.930
What's with the euphemisms, jack?

02:04.998 --> 02:07.700
Why don't you just say you want some...

02:07.768 --> 02:10.770
- Is that sex, lemon?
- Is the way I do it.

02:10.836 --> 02:12.905
So who's the lucky lady? - I'm not sure yet.

02:12.973 --> 02:14.740
I have three dates set up across the city,

02:14.808 --> 02:16.142
And I hope one of them works out.

02:16.209 --> 02:18.144
How are you gonna handle
three different dates?

02:18.211 --> 02:19.545
Well, I have a system for first dates.

02:19.613 --> 02:20.946
At the appointed time, jonathan calls me

02:21.014 --> 02:22.348
And tells me that I have a conference call

02:22.416 --> 02:23.783
With the geneva office.

02:23.850 --> 02:25.584
If I don't like the woman,
I have an excuse to leave.

02:25.652 --> 02:27.686
If I do like her, I loudly tell jonathan

02:27.754 --> 02:29.188
That I'm doing something more important.

02:29.256 --> 02:30.589
The woman is suitably impressed.

02:30.657 --> 02:33.125
And I'm guaranteed to see some underwear.

02:33.193 --> 02:35.928
Perhaps a, uh, bra with a front clasp.

02:35.996 --> 02:37.396
What?

02:37.464 --> 02:39.598
What are your plans for
valentine's day, lemon?

02:39.666 --> 02:42.334
I am taking myself out
of the equation entirely.

02:42.402 --> 02:45.337
I scheduled a root canal
for February 14th, jack.

02:45.405 --> 02:47.339
I will spend half the day in twilight sleep.

02:47.407 --> 02:50.576
Then I will go home and watch
the lifetime original movie

02:50.644 --> 02:53.012
<i>My stepson is my cyber-husband.</i>

02:53.079 --> 02:54.613
Wow. That is inspired.

02:54.681 --> 02:57.917
You are truly the picasso of loneliness.

02:57.984 --> 03:02.254
Or I am that painting
elephant of being awesome.

03:06.593 --> 03:08.928
Oh, kenneth, have any
packages come for me today?

03:08.995 --> 03:10.229
No, miss maroney.

03:10.297 --> 03:11.864
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

03:11.932 --> 03:13.532
Valentine's day is always a huge deal

03:13.600 --> 03:15.201
For maynard roger hoynes.

03:15.268 --> 03:16.635
That's my stalker.

03:16.703 --> 03:18.003
You have a stalker?

03:18.071 --> 03:19.705
It's a real problem in
the celebrity community.

03:19.773 --> 03:22.675
<i>But if beyonce simply answered
one of my letters,</i>

03:22.742 --> 03:24.643
I'd stop trying to break into her house.

03:24.711 --> 03:26.912
So if you haven't heard from him,

03:26.980 --> 03:28.414
Isn't that a good thing?

03:28.482 --> 03:30.916
Kenneth, the celebrit
y- stalker relationship

03:30.984 --> 03:32.418
Is very special.

03:32.486 --> 03:34.253
Maynard's debilitating devotion

03:34.321 --> 03:36.555
Validates how wonderful I am.

03:36.623 --> 03:38.457
But what does it say about
me if he's moved on?

03:38.525 --> 03:41.460
Maybe to one of my peers like julia roberts.

03:44.664 --> 03:46.732
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation,

03:46.800 --> 03:48.801
Miss maroney.

03:52.138 --> 03:53.939
Hey.

03:54.007 --> 03:56.575
Has anybody heard about any
cool new sex positions?

03:56.643 --> 03:58.410
My girlfriend's visiting for valentine's

03:58.478 --> 04:00.980
<i>And I want to keep things caliente.</i>

04:01.047 --> 04:02.081
Oh, my god, lutz.

04:02.148 --> 04:04.116
Are you still pretending karen exists?

04:04.184 --> 04:05.518
She's real.

04:05.585 --> 04:07.019
Would a fake woman have a personal web site

04:07.087 --> 04:09.889
At jdlutz.Com/karen/proof?

04:09.956 --> 04:11.490
Oh, good grief.

04:11.558 --> 04:13.792
My cousin set me up on a
blind date for valentine's,

04:13.860 --> 04:17.663
And I just found out the girl is...Well...

04:17.731 --> 04:18.731
Urban.

04:18.798 --> 04:20.132
Are you saying she's black?

04:20.200 --> 04:21.634
I don't know how to get out of this.

04:21.701 --> 04:23.102
Dude, come out with me.

04:23.169 --> 04:24.703
You know that load with the messed-up teeth

04:24.771 --> 04:25.738
Who cleans the urinals?

04:25.805 --> 04:26.805
She'll only go out with me

04:26.873 --> 04:28.340
If she can bring her ugly sister.

04:28.408 --> 04:30.175
Wow, I can't believe you guys

04:30.243 --> 04:32.478
Are letting valentine's day win.

04:32.546 --> 04:35.281
Not me. One word. Oral.

04:35.348 --> 04:38.317
Two words. Oral surgery.

04:38.385 --> 04:40.786
I'm having oral surgery and
skipping valentine's day.

04:40.854 --> 04:42.187
Doctor's orders.

04:42.255 --> 04:44.523
Oh, that reminds me, dr.
Kaplan's office called.

04:44.591 --> 04:45.858
They want to know who's picking you up

04:45.926 --> 04:46.992
After your procedure.

04:47.060 --> 04:48.394
- What?
- Yeah. It's an insurance thing.

04:48.461 --> 04:49.628
Any time they have anesthesia,

04:49.696 --> 04:50.763
Someone needs to bring you home.

04:50.797 --> 04:52.298
Hey, that stuff messes you up.

04:52.365 --> 04:53.699
When I had my wisdom teeth out,

04:53.767 --> 04:55.935
I tried to get in the bath with my mom.

04:56.002 --> 04:58.971
Okay, is there any chance
that you could take me home?

04:59.039 --> 05:00.406
Sorry.

05:00.473 --> 05:02.441
Every year, paula and I rent
this big suite up at niagara.

05:02.509 --> 05:03.642
And then she takes the kids there

05:03.710 --> 05:05.778
And I stay home and get wasted in my garage.

05:05.845 --> 05:08.681
It's what keeps the magic alive.

05:08.748 --> 05:09.982
Welcome back.

05:10.050 --> 05:11.951
I'm here with sheinhard
t- universal vice president

05:12.018 --> 05:13.419
Jack donaghy.

05:13.486 --> 05:14.820
Thanks for sitting in the hot box, jack.

05:14.888 --> 05:16.221
My pleasure, avery.

05:16.289 --> 05:17.756
Also joining me, walter stein,

05:17.824 --> 05:20.492
Whose bow tie tells us he works
for some liberal think tank.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.694
And the food in his beard tells us

05:21.761 --> 05:22.795
That he purchased a snack pack

05:22.862 --> 05:24.029
On the train from new haven.

05:24.097 --> 05:25.698
Ooh, that's got to hurt, walter.

05:25.765 --> 05:28.133
Let's get to the countdown. First topic.

05:28.201 --> 05:30.336
Prime minister wen wants a weak yuan. Do we?

05:30.403 --> 05:32.371
China needs to transition
to a spending economy.

05:32.439 --> 05:34.006
After dubai, what's the next credit crisis?

05:34.074 --> 05:35.107
The baltics or women's tennis.

05:35.175 --> 05:36.475
Do we need a second bailout?

05:36.543 --> 05:38.077
- Absolutely...Not.
- I love it.

05:38.144 --> 05:39.478
Try to get in there, beta dog.

05:39.546 --> 05:40.779
- I am trying.
- On three.

05:40.847 --> 05:42.615
Who will be thnext president
of these United States?

05:42.682 --> 05:43.882
Three.

05:43.950 --> 05:46.251
Mitt romney's oldest son jezba.

05:46.319 --> 05:48.087
- Dennis kucinich.
- Okay, that's sad, walter.

05:48.154 --> 05:50.155
Just sad. Jack, back to you.

05:50.223 --> 05:51.457
Who's number one on your speed dial?

05:51.524 --> 05:53.092
Blackberry, warren buffett.
Iphone, jimmy buffett.

05:53.159 --> 05:54.259
- Favorite movie.
- Tie.

05:54.327 --> 05:55.594
<i>The fountainhead or uncle buck.</i>

05:55.662 --> 05:57.162
i>- My wife and I just saw
the yellow handkerchief.

05:57.230 --> 05:58.797
Just sit a couple out/ stein. God.

05:58.865 --> 06:00.132
All right, karaoke. Go to jack. Hit me.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.934
- Nitty gritty dirt band.
- Oh, I rock the brothers.

06:02.002 --> 06:03.335
Hey, let's grab a drink after this.

06:03.403 --> 06:04.470
You read my mind.

06:04.537 --> 06:05.871
We'll be right back after this ad

06:05.939 --> 06:07.673
Aimed at the elderly.

06:07.741 --> 06:09.808
One second.

06:12.779 --> 06:14.046
Hey, tray,

06:14.114 --> 06:15.848
I really need a ride home from the doctors

06:15.915 --> 06:17.016
On valentine's day.

06:17.083 --> 06:18.317
- Can't do it, li
-lem.

06:18.385 --> 06:19.818
On valentine's day,

06:19.886 --> 06:21.553
Angie and I rent a room
with a heart-shaped hot tub

06:21.621 --> 06:22.821
And cook chili in it.

06:22.889 --> 06:24.356
Then we take it to a soup kitchen

06:24.424 --> 06:26.959
<i>And that's where it
starts to get sexy.</i>

06:28.461 --> 06:30.496
Hey, jenna, please tell me

06:30.563 --> 06:31.664
You haven't already concocted

06:31.731 --> 06:33.232
Your usual valentine's day drama.

06:33.299 --> 06:34.700
Can't talk, liz.

06:34.768 --> 06:36.635
I just got my stalker's work
address from his parole officer.

06:36.703 --> 06:39.538
And I'm gonna confront him
about why he's ignoring me.

06:42.308 --> 06:44.710
Hey, kenneth. Are you free on valentine's?

06:44.778 --> 06:46.211
No, miss lemon. I'm sorry.

06:46.279 --> 06:49.348
I will be attending an al
l-day abstinence rally.

06:49.416 --> 06:50.516
You're welcome to come.

06:50.583 --> 06:51.684
I think I've got an extra

06:51.751 --> 06:54.987
Gender-neutralizing hood.

06:55.055 --> 06:58.323
- No. Thanks. God.
- Hey, liz!

06:58.391 --> 07:00.893
- Hey.
- The answer's no.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:10.971 --> 07:11.773
Hello, maynard.

07:13.841 --> 07:16.076
Jenna, you shouldn't have come here.

07:16.244 --> 07:17.510
Well, what was I supposed to do?

07:17.578 --> 07:18.912
It's almost valentine's day

07:18.980 --> 07:20.380
And I haven't heard anything from you.

07:20.448 --> 07:22.415
Has the dog who gives you your orders died?

07:22.483 --> 07:25.518
No. Brandon's fine. Jenna, we need to talk.

07:25.586 --> 07:27.087
I don't think I can stalk you anymore.

07:27.154 --> 07:29.856
No. You don't mean that.

07:29.924 --> 07:32.225
Look, I have a new therapist,
I'm taking my meds.

07:32.293 --> 07:33.393
I can't even see electricity

07:33.461 --> 07:34.794
Shooting out of your head any more.

07:34.862 --> 07:36.329
Well, is there someone else?

07:36.397 --> 07:38.598
<i>It's one of those kids from glee,
isn't it?</i>

07:38.666 --> 07:40.433
Jenna, please, don't make a scene.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.603
I always knew this would end someday.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.272
I just thought it would
be with me in the trunk

07:45.339 --> 07:48.508
Of a rental car.

07:57.051 --> 07:58.151
So, uh, where did you go to school?

07:58.219 --> 07:59.552
Choate, then yale,

07:59.620 --> 08:01.454
Then two years in africa
with the peace corp.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.156
The peace corps. That's surprising.

08:03.224 --> 08:05.358
Oh, no, the peace corp.

08:05.426 --> 08:06.893
Lawrence peace's corporation.

08:06.961 --> 08:09.162
We drilled for oil in gorilla habitats.

08:09.230 --> 08:10.630
Oh, of course.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.433
I learned to talk to gorillas
when I worked for ge medical.

08:13.501 --> 08:16.670
Uh, we're going to test poisons on you.

08:16.737 --> 08:17.904
Oh. -

08:17.972 --> 08:21.741
So, uh, are you seeing anyone?

08:21.809 --> 08:23.343
Not for a few months.

08:23.411 --> 08:25.178
You remind me of him, actually.

08:25.246 --> 08:27.847
I have a thing for commanding
salt and pepper types.

08:27.915 --> 08:29.182
I don't know why.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.251
I think it started when
I walked into my parents

08:31.319 --> 08:33.320
Doing it the day reagan was shot.

08:33.386 --> 08:34.654
- I wouldn't over
-analyze that.

08:37.591 --> 08:38.924
Hello.

08:38.993 --> 08:40.994
I am calling about the mad
e-up conference call with geneva.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.495
I love having secrets with you.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.431
One time, I ran over an old lady in arizona

08:44.498 --> 08:46.166
And just kept driving.

08:46.233 --> 08:47.300
Yes. Damn it. Geneva.

08:47.368 --> 08:48.702
Well, cancel the conference call.

08:48.769 --> 08:51.204
I'm doing something far
more important right now.

08:51.272 --> 08:54.474
And more beautiful.

08:54.542 --> 08:57.644
You're kidding, right? I mean,
that's your move?

08:57.712 --> 08:58.912
- I
-I beg your pardon.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.513
It's 3:30 in the morning in geneva, jack.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.948
Who's your call with?

09:02.016 --> 09:03.850
The hooker working the corner
outside of raiffeisenbank?

09:03.918 --> 09:05.185
Oh, well, it is February.

09:05.252 --> 09:08.388
And in switzerland,
that is night business month.

09:08.456 --> 09:10.657
- Okay.
- All right, I'm sorry.

09:10.725 --> 09:11.992
I forgot who I was dealing with.

09:12.059 --> 09:13.827
Stay and just have another drink.

09:13.894 --> 09:15.462
Look at me, jack.

09:15.529 --> 09:17.030
Look how my body goes with this dress.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.065
I don't need to be dealing with amateurs.

09:24.038 --> 09:26.339
Listen, frank, I really need
a ride home from the doctor

09:26.407 --> 09:27.507
On valentine's day.

09:27.575 --> 09:28.541
Are you free?

09:28.609 --> 09:30.143
No. That cleaning lady finally agreed

09:30.211 --> 09:31.311
To go out with me.

09:31.379 --> 09:32.812
We're gonna pick up some pierogies

09:32.880 --> 09:34.314
And then eat them at her husband's grave.

09:34.382 --> 09:36.282
you thought you were so
much smarter than us,

09:36.350 --> 09:38.451
Didn't you?

09:38.519 --> 09:40.120
But now you're in the exact same

09:40.187 --> 09:42.222
Crappy valentine's day
boat everyone else is in.

09:42.289 --> 09:43.490
No, I'm not.

09:43.557 --> 09:45.291
I just need a ride home, not a date.

09:45.359 --> 09:46.860
They're completely different situations.

09:46.927 --> 09:48.461
How's that?

09:48.529 --> 09:50.497
All we want on valentine's day
is to know that someone cares

09:50.564 --> 09:51.698
Even a little about us.

09:51.766 --> 09:55.068
Aren't you lookivg for the same thing?

09:55.136 --> 09:57.337
In fact, yours is worse.

09:57.405 --> 09:58.738
If you don't get that tooth fixed,

09:58.806 --> 10:00.740
The infection will
probably move to your brain

10:00.808 --> 10:02.675
And kill you.

10:02.743 --> 10:05.178
Yeah, well, if I die,
my ghost is gonna haunt you.

10:05.246 --> 10:07.280
Then your ghost is gonna see

10:07.348 --> 10:09.649
Some disgusting stuff.

10:13.087 --> 10:16.156
Lemon, look at this. It's from avery jessup.

10:16.223 --> 10:17.390
Oh, it's set to the wrong time.

10:17.458 --> 10:18.558
It's set to geneva time.

10:18.626 --> 10:19.826
Last night, avery saw right through

10:19.894 --> 10:21.161
My conference call move.

10:21.228 --> 10:22.962
Today, she sent this.

10:23.030 --> 10:24.898
"hopefully you won't make
the same mistake again,

10:24.965 --> 10:26.332
<i>Mon sel et poivre."</i>

10:26.400 --> 10:28.802
That means "my salt and
pepper" in swiss french.

10:28.869 --> 10:31.604
She's hitting the ball back, lemon. Game on.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.106
Wow. Avery jesvup. She's hot.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.142
<i>She was on maxim's "
I'd rape that 100."</i>

10:36.210 --> 10:37.544
I know. And besides being beautiful,

10:37.611 --> 10:39.212
Avery is smart and doesn't suffer fools.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.513
And when I eventually seduce her,

10:40.581 --> 10:43.483
It's going to be... Very satisfying.

10:43.551 --> 10:44.818
Well, great.

10:44.885 --> 10:46.853
I hope you enjoy your weird game

10:46.921 --> 10:48.388
Of sexy one-upsmanship.

10:48.456 --> 10:50.490
Meanwhile, the male escort that I hired

10:50.558 --> 10:51.925
To take me home from surgery

10:51.992 --> 10:54.160
Has had a chlamydia flare-up, so--

10:54.228 --> 10:55.495
Uh, lemon, I wish I could help you,

10:55.563 --> 10:57.430
But I have to concentrate on avery.

10:57.498 --> 11:00.266
Uh, I need a big next move
and you have a show tonight.

11:00.334 --> 11:03.069
<i>I've invited her to be my guest at the tgs
vip room.</i>

11:03.137 --> 11:05.805
We don't have a vip room or vips.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.073
Get jon bon jovi.

11:07.141 --> 11:09.476
He's nbc's current artist in residence.

11:09.543 --> 11:10.777
What is that?

11:10.845 --> 11:12.645
i>- A not stupid program
that I came up with.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.148
Bon jovi is under contract
with us for a full year

11:15.216 --> 11:16.749
And scheduled to appear across a variety

11:16.817 --> 11:19.352
Of programming platforms.

11:27.862 --> 11:30.430
Okay, fine. I'll set it up.

11:30.498 --> 11:31.464
Thank you.

11:31.532 --> 11:32.599
Because tonight, she's going to get

11:32.666 --> 11:33.933
The jack donaghy "a" game.

11:34.001 --> 11:36.336
Ooh. She's getting the
jack donaghy "a" game.

11:36.403 --> 11:38.438
Hope she can keep her clothes on.

11:38.506 --> 11:41.774
Lemon, your hair looks very nice today.

11:41.842 --> 11:43.176
You should wear it like that more often.

11:43.244 --> 11:47.614
- Oh, my. Well, I
-I never, uh...

11:52.686 --> 11:54.954
Oh. Ma'am, is something wrong?

11:55.022 --> 11:58.691
- Maynard left me.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.160
Look at this.

12:00.227 --> 12:02.195
It's the first letter he ever sent me.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.330
"jenna, I was in your bedroom last night.

12:04.398 --> 12:07.133
I left a gift in your toilet.

12:07.201 --> 12:09.802
You will be my bride someday."

12:09.870 --> 12:11.538
Oh.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.473
How can you be upset about
losing a guy like this,

12:13.541 --> 12:14.541
Miss maroney?

12:14.608 --> 12:16.109
Look, I know it's crazy.

12:16.177 --> 12:17.610
Maynard is a weirdo.

12:17.678 --> 12:20.180
But that weirdo loved me unconditionally.

12:20.247 --> 12:21.781
You know what I realized?

12:21.849 --> 12:24.350
He's the longest relationship I've ever had.

12:24.418 --> 12:27.120
Except, of course, for doug.

12:27.188 --> 12:28.321
Please do not say what doug is.

12:28.389 --> 12:31.925
Doug is my vibrator.

12:31.992 --> 12:35.195
This is the worst valentine's day ever.

12:35.262 --> 12:36.763
Hello, this is elizabeth lemon.

12:36.830 --> 12:38.831
I have surgery scheduled tomorrow.

12:38.899 --> 12:40.733
And I am not embarrassed to tell you

12:40.801 --> 12:42.735
That I don't have anyone to pick me up

12:42.803 --> 12:44.404
And I will be leaving alone.

12:44.471 --> 12:45.972
Ma'am, you really need someone.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.974
i>- No, I don't. I don't need anyone.

12:48.042 --> 12:49.475
Because I can do every single thing

12:49.543 --> 12:51.211
That a person in a relationship can.

12:51.278 --> 12:55.915
Everything. Even zip up my own dress.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.083
Hmm.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.251
You know, there are some things

12:58.319 --> 13:00.186
That are actually harder
to do with two people

13:00.254 --> 13:02.655
Such as...Monologues.

13:02.723 --> 13:05.325
i>- Look, if you really
don't have anyone,

13:05.392 --> 13:06.793
You can sign a liability release,

13:06.860 --> 13:07.961
Then you can leave alone.

13:08.028 --> 13:10.029
I'll fax it to your office. - Great.

13:10.097 --> 13:12.732
Thank you for looking out for a sister.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.101
In a feminist way, not because you're black.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.103
Although it doesn't matter
because I'm black too.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.872
No. You're gonna meet me. No, I'm not black.

13:30.972 --> 13:32.906
Thank you for setting all this up, lemon.

13:32.974 --> 13:34.575
Grizz, dotcom, thank you for pretending

13:34.643 --> 13:35.743
To be bouncers.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.077
Maybe some day we'll live in a world

13:37.145 --> 13:39.213
Where you ask us to
pretend to be scientists.

13:41.716 --> 13:43.884
Jon. Thank you for coming.

13:43.952 --> 13:44.985
Oh, no problem, jack.

13:45.053 --> 13:46.186
What do you need, arena rock anthem,

13:46.254 --> 13:47.254
Power ballad?

13:47.322 --> 13:48.989
Actually, I have a date coming by.

13:49.057 --> 13:50.791
So if you can come over at
some point and say hello,

13:50.859 --> 13:52.993
That would really impress her.

13:53.061 --> 13:54.595
Oh, sure. That sounds
like an appropriate use

13:54.663 --> 13:57.531
Of my time and talent.

13:57.599 --> 14:00.100
Liz. The doctor's office
faxed this to you earlier.

14:00.168 --> 14:01.535
Hey, when are you going to set up that cool

14:01.603 --> 14:02.536
Vip lounge?

14:02.604 --> 14:05.472
Thank you, cerie.

14:08.743 --> 14:10.110
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:10.178 --> 14:12.212
You shouldn't sign anything
without reading it first.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.547
I made that mistake once

14:13.615 --> 14:15.783
And I ended up nbc's artist in residence.

14:15.850 --> 14:18.352
Oh. Okay.

14:18.420 --> 14:20.087
Give me it.

14:20.155 --> 14:22.089
I have an honorary degree
from monmouth university.

14:22.157 --> 14:23.257
Hmm.

14:23.325 --> 14:24.758
"I, the undersigned,

14:24.826 --> 14:26.393
"henceforce known as the alone,

14:26.461 --> 14:27.995
"hereby state that on February 14th,

14:28.063 --> 14:31.265
I have absolutely no one in my life."

14:31.333 --> 14:33.167
You're alone on valentine's day?

14:33.234 --> 14:34.735
It's not about a date.

14:34.803 --> 14:36.537
I just don't have a ride home
from the doctor's office.

14:36.604 --> 14:38.005
But isn't that the same thing?

14:38.073 --> 14:39.740
I mean, isn't it about
having somebody out there--

14:39.808 --> 14:40.908
Yeah, I get it, bon jovi,

14:40.975 --> 14:43.477
It's already been explained to me.

14:43.545 --> 14:47.915
"I, the alone, otherwise
known as jane sadwoman,

14:47.982 --> 14:50.284
"release dr. Kaplan's office

14:50.352 --> 14:52.586
Of all legal responsibilities.

14:52.654 --> 14:55.923
"will likely die alone eaten by house cats."

14:55.990 --> 14:57.658
Boy, this seems like a lot of unnecessary--

14:57.726 --> 14:59.827
Forget it. I am not signing this.

14:59.894 --> 15:02.229
I reject the idea that there's some stigma

15:02.297 --> 15:03.464
To being alone.

15:03.531 --> 15:04.631
All rit, then what's the plan

15:04.699 --> 15:05.899
If you don't sign the release?

15:05.967 --> 15:07.735
I'll just tell them that my "boyfriend"

15:07.802 --> 15:09.069
Is gonna pick me up.

15:09.137 --> 15:10.871
And then after the surgery,
I'll make a run for it.

15:10.939 --> 15:12.306
So you're going to invent a boyfriend

15:12.374 --> 15:13.574
On valentine's day?

15:13.641 --> 15:17.244
That is the lamest thing
I've heard since...This.

15:17.312 --> 15:20.414
I'm tyke myson, baby boxer.

15:20.482 --> 15:22.049
I wrote that.

15:22.117 --> 15:25.552
I'm tyke myson, baby boxer.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.088
Hey, jack, who's this lovely--?

15:28.156 --> 15:29.289
Excuse me, bon jovi,

15:29.357 --> 15:30.624
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.

15:30.692 --> 15:33.794
- Yeah, but you said to--
- uh, thank you.

15:33.862 --> 15:36.930
- I hate it here.
- Wow.

15:36.998 --> 15:38.265
That was a lot better

15:38.333 --> 15:39.933
Than your little conference call move.

15:40.001 --> 15:41.568
Can I get you a drink, avery?

15:41.636 --> 15:42.703
Or we could just get out of here.

15:42.771 --> 15:46.173
Yes. We could.

15:50.378 --> 15:52.413
Hello. Elizabeth lemon.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.714
Do you have your release?

15:53.782 --> 15:56.250
No, I don't need it because my boyfriend,

15:56.317 --> 15:57.985
Astronaut mike dexter,

15:58.052 --> 16:00.320
Will be picking me up...

16:00.388 --> 16:02.656
On his motorcycle.

16:02.724 --> 16:04.825
- Mm
-hmm. Take a seat.

16:04.893 --> 16:06.093
* I will *

16:06.161 --> 16:11.632
* remember you *

16:11.699 --> 16:15.068
* will you remember me? *

16:15.136 --> 16:18.739
Oh. Oh.

16:18.807 --> 16:23.210
Ah.

16:23.278 --> 16:27.815
* *

16:32.187 --> 16:34.588
* *

16:37.592 --> 16:39.359
* *

16:39.427 --> 16:42.162
* that we had *

16:43.865 --> 16:46.166
* *

16:46.234 --> 16:49.369
maynard?

16:49.437 --> 16:51.004
* I will *

16:51.072 --> 16:55.409
* remember you *

16:55.477 --> 16:57.377
You know, I don't think the "anastacia"

16:57.445 --> 17:00.481
Actually "affectored" me.

17:00.548 --> 17:02.149
Oh, my god. What are you doing here?

17:02.217 --> 17:03.784
We knew you'd need a ride home.

17:03.852 --> 17:05.051
What do you mean we?

17:05.118 --> 17:06.954
You can't leave without a ride, dummy.

17:07.021 --> 17:08.589
Happy valentine's day.

17:08.656 --> 17:10.290
Oh, you have some dried blood on your teeth.

17:10.358 --> 17:11.625
You're here.

17:11.693 --> 17:13.227
You're all here because you didn't want me

17:13.294 --> 17:14.494
To be alone today.

17:14.561 --> 17:18.131
Oh, floyd, I still think every day

17:18.199 --> 17:19.366
About what would've happened

17:19.434 --> 17:21.801
If I had gone to cleveland with you.

17:21.869 --> 17:23.971
And even you, dennis,

17:24.038 --> 17:26.106
<i>Watching the color purple
drunk with you</i>

17:26.174 --> 17:28.976
Was one of the funnest nights of my life.

17:29.043 --> 17:32.713
And drew, so handsome.

17:32.780 --> 17:35.282
So, so stupid.

17:35.350 --> 17:38.685
Seeing all of your beautiful faces

17:38.753 --> 17:41.688
And dennis' jean jacket,

17:41.756 --> 17:43.123
I know that I don't need anyone,

17:43.191 --> 17:45.559
But I do want to be loved.

17:45.627 --> 17:46.727
We all do.

17:46.794 --> 17:48.328
And if it didn't work out between us,

17:48.396 --> 17:52.132
It's just because I'm not
finished becoming me yet.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.735
But I will find love someday.

17:54.802 --> 17:57.404
Because I am a sailor

17:57.472 --> 17:59.940
On the sea of the human heart.

18:00.008 --> 18:01.842
Okay, this bitch is tripping her ass off.

18:01.910 --> 18:03.343
Well, what do we do with her?

18:03.411 --> 18:04.978
I got a date tonight.

18:05.046 --> 18:07.548
I say we order us some
pizza and lock her in here

18:07.615 --> 18:08.849
For the weekend.

18:08.917 --> 18:09.983
I'm gonna start dialing numbers

18:10.051 --> 18:10.984
Till somebody pick up.

18:11.052 --> 18:13.554
What's that, bon jovi?

18:13.621 --> 18:15.455
You love me too?

18:19.928 --> 18:21.895
Hey. You want to grab breakfast?

18:21.963 --> 18:23.730
You're sweet, jack, but let's not pretend

18:23.798 --> 18:25.332
This is anything more than it is.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.000
I'm sorry?

18:27.068 --> 18:28.936
Look, despite what happened
in the shower last night,

18:29.003 --> 18:30.137
I'm a pretty traditional girl.

18:30.204 --> 18:32.706
I mean, I want a husband
someday and a family

18:32.774 --> 18:34.241
And men like you don't.

18:34.309 --> 18:35.842
"men like me"? That isn't fair.

18:35.910 --> 18:37.044
I want a family.

18:37.111 --> 18:38.679
A son I can throw a ball to

18:38.746 --> 18:40.948
And when he's older,
have power struggles with.

18:41.015 --> 18:43.350
Jack, you don't have to lie to me, okay?

18:43.418 --> 18:45.018
I love guys like you.

18:45.086 --> 18:47.354
You're great! For one night.

18:47.422 --> 18:48.689
Look, avery, I admit, this isn't

18:48.756 --> 18:50.924
What I was looking for
going into this weekend.

18:50.992 --> 18:52.459
But you're an amazing woman.

18:55.930 --> 19:00.434
Lemon, I c--oh. You're kidding.

19:00.501 --> 19:03.170
Okay. I--I--I'll be right there.

19:03.237 --> 19:05.372
Uh, I need to go.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.008
Jack, the phone trick again?

19:08.076 --> 19:09.843
I mean, I'd be insulted
if I wasn't so impressed

19:09.911 --> 19:10.944
By your assistant.

19:11.012 --> 19:12.179
This isn't a trick.

19:12.246 --> 19:14.948
I have to pick up a
hallucinating employee of mine

19:15.016 --> 19:16.450
From the oral surgeon's office.

19:16.517 --> 19:17.951
Well, that's at least creative.

19:18.019 --> 19:20.187
Look, cancel your walk of shame.

19:20.254 --> 19:22.823
Come with me on a car ride of proof.

19:27.161 --> 19:30.797
oh, my god.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.532
Who did this?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.035
I don't know.

19:35.103 --> 19:37.671
I guess some weirdo out there loves you.

19:40.475 --> 19:41.842
Thank you, kenneth.

19:41.909 --> 19:45.212
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:45.279 --> 19:46.980
Happy valentine's day.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.195
What hotel is this?

20:02.263 --> 20:03.563
Uh, would you just keep an eye on her?

20:03.631 --> 20:05.932
I'm gonna turn down her bed.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.301
i>- I was sure he was making this up.

20:08.369 --> 20:10.270
Yes, you're a very pretty doggy.

20:10.338 --> 20:13.106
Hey, what do you think about jack?

20:13.174 --> 20:16.877
Who, jacky? He's the best one.

20:16.944 --> 20:19.646
I don't know what I would do without him.

20:19.714 --> 20:21.214
Yeah, he is pretty great, isn't he?

20:21.282 --> 20:25.218
bon jovi.

20:27.455 --> 20:30.457
- Um...
- Uh, no, no, no, no, lemon.

20:30.525 --> 20:32.292
It's time for bed. It's time for bed. Yeah.
