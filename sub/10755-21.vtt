00:12.491 --> 00:14.520
Oh, Dr. Crane

00:14.520 --> 00:16.858
My God, after all our years together

00:16.858 --> 00:19.549
all the good times, all the bad times

00:19.549 --> 00:24.070
can't loan me a meager four
thousand dollars?

00:24.070 --> 00:27.702
You must appreciate how hard it is
for me to approach you about this.

00:27.702 --> 00:31.427
I thought I meant more
to you than this, but apparently I don't.

00:31.427 --> 00:36.054
And they call themselves
"the friendly bank!"

00:36.054 --> 00:37.595
What do you need to borrow money for?

00:37.595 --> 00:41.013
I saw the most exquisite
Biedermeier footstool.

00:41.013 --> 00:42.628
For four thousand bucks?

00:42.628 --> 00:45.885
Niles, your mother and I didn't
pay that much for our first house.

00:45.885 --> 00:46.388
I know, dad.

00:46.388 --> 00:49.557
I lived there.

00:49.557 --> 00:50.357
Well, I keep telling you,

00:50.357 --> 00:52.549
you don't have Maris's money 
tothrow around anymore.

00:52.549 --> 00:54.033
You're going to have to start
cutting back a little.

00:54.033 --> 00:55.114
I have cut back.

00:55.114 --> 00:57.707
Last month I told my masseur 
I could only see him once a week.

00:57.707 --> 01:00.187
Oh, I remember that scene
in "Grapes Of Wrath"

01:00.187 --> 01:03.595
when Ma Joad did that.

01:03.595 --> 01:04.799
You know, if you need to save a bit,

01:04.799 --> 01:07.876
you should do what I do
and cut out coupons.

01:07.876 --> 01:09.583
Coupons.

01:09.583 --> 01:11.797
Well, what a wonderful way to economize.

01:11.797 --> 01:16.474
Well, I could clip them and give them
to my personal shopper.

01:16.474 --> 01:17.643
Oh, Niles, good morning.

01:17.643 --> 01:18.298
Hey.

01:18.298 --> 01:20.644
Daphne, has Bebe Glazer called back yet?

01:20.644 --> 01:21.858
'Fraid not.

01:21.858 --> 01:24.980
You're still consorting with that barracuda?

01:24.980 --> 01:28.357
Well, a barracuda is what 
you want in an agent, Niles.

01:28.357 --> 01:30.052
It's just that the station's been sold,

01:30.052 --> 01:33.177
I was hoping she might have some
scuttlebutt on the new owner.

01:33.177 --> 01:36.065
I must admit she's rather hard 
to get a hold of these days

01:36.065 --> 01:38.206
Oh, really?  I thought one just 
drew a pentagram on the floor

01:38.206 --> 01:44.393
and chanted "I summon thee" three times.

01:44.393 --> 01:44.866
Hello, Roz.

01:44.866 --> 01:47.817
Hey.

01:47.817 --> 01:48.788
What have you got on the new owner?

01:48.788 --> 01:49.292
Oh, plenty.

01:49.292 --> 01:49.893
Yeah?

01:49.893 --> 01:50.862
His name is Wilford S. Boone,

01:50.862 --> 01:52.446
but he likes to be called "Big Willy."

01:52.446 --> 01:57.093
Well, there's a little snapshot
of his psyche right there.

01:57.093 --> 01:59.654
He's an eighty-five year-old Texan.

01:59.654 --> 02:01.675
Practically 
no formal education but he went from

02:01.675 --> 02:03.511
errand boy at a radio station 
to owning his own

02:03.511 --> 02:07.238
media empire worth six hundred million.

02:07.238 --> 02:08.768
This is great, I don't even know

02:08.768 --> 02:13.927
what "Renuzit" is, but it's
twenty cents off and I want it.

02:13.927 --> 02:15.384
You're clipping coupons?

02:15.384 --> 02:16.776
I'm economizing.

02:16.776 --> 02:19.942
Oh well it's about time, you spend
money like a drunken sailor.

02:19.942 --> 02:23.136
She said authoritatively.

02:23.136 --> 02:25.037
Excuse me, could we get back
to the subject at hand, please?

02:25.037 --> 02:26.165
What are you so antsy about?

02:26.165 --> 02:27.752
Dad, Wilford S. Boone-

02:27.752 --> 02:29.351
Big Willy.

02:29.351 --> 02:32.598
Please, Roz, 
I just can't say that yet, alright?

02:32.598 --> 02:35.900
Wilford S. Boone owns thirty radio
stations across the country.

02:35.900 --> 02:39.109
If he likes you he's been known
to syndicate your show nationwide.

02:39.109 --> 02:42.055
So, I'm trying to find out
if we have anything in common

02:42.055 --> 02:43.577
an angle, if you will.

02:43.577 --> 02:44.982
So what are his interests, Roz?

02:44.982 --> 02:45.769
Well, it's all in there.

02:45.769 --> 02:49.064
He likes whittling, rodeos,
the novels of Zane Grey...

02:49.064 --> 02:54.360
Gee, Fras.  
It's like you two were separated at birth.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.953
He also owns a 5,000 acre cattle ranch 
and the world's

02:56.953 --> 02:59.737
largest collection of antique six-shooters.

02:59.737 --> 03:05.232
Oh dear God, I'm sucking up to Yosemite Sam!

03:07.017 --> 03:08.729
I think if we really want to impress Big Willy

03:08.729 --> 03:11.688
we should think of some Western
theme to do for the show today.

03:11.688 --> 03:12.526
Great idea, Roz.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.272
Why don't we just start the
show off with a segment on

03:14.272 --> 03:17.126
how to get in touch with your inner young'un.

03:17.126 --> 03:19.006
What a fascinating theory!  Do go on.

03:19.006 --> 03:19.791
What's going on?

03:19.791 --> 03:20.975
Oh, this is great.

03:20.975 --> 03:24.496
I told Gil the new station owner 
is a Greek tycoon.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.399
He fell for that?

03:25.399 --> 03:29.317
Hook, line, and souvlaki!

03:29.317 --> 03:33.136
You can keep your overripe
Camembert and malodorous Stilton,

03:33.136 --> 03:36.919
they can't compare with the
salty insouciance of Greece's

03:36.919 --> 03:40.424
glorious Feta.

03:40.424 --> 03:44.990
It's not just for shepherds anymore!

03:44.990 --> 03:47.981
This is Gil Chesterton saying Bon Appetite,

03:47.981 --> 03:53.078
or as we say in Athens, Kali Orexi!

03:53.078 --> 03:54.709
Oh Gil, you've been had.

03:54.709 --> 03:57.396
The new station owner isn't Greek, 
he's from Texas.

03:57.396 --> 03:59.063
You are so easy!

03:59.063 --> 04:00.397
Well, I hope you're happy!

04:00.397 --> 04:03.692
I've just given four stars to a
restaurant called "A Taste Of Greece."

04:03.692 --> 04:06.662
Which, trust me, is no misnomer.

04:06.662 --> 04:07.830
Well that's what you deserve,

04:07.830 --> 04:10.076
trying to suck up to some senile old coot!

04:10.076 --> 04:14.750
Hell, he probably can't eat anything
but strained peas and farina!

04:14.750 --> 04:15.907
Uh, Mr Boone?

04:15.907 --> 04:17.596
Yeah, that's right.

04:17.596 --> 04:18.175
Pleasure to see you.

04:18.175 --> 04:18.930
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

04:18.930 --> 04:21.397
This is Roz Doyle, Gil Chesterton and...

04:21.397 --> 04:22.877
I'm Skippy the lunch boy.

04:22.877 --> 04:26.813
So, uh, that's two strained peas
and a farina for the big guy.

04:26.813 --> 04:29.341
Oh, uh, Skippy?  Change my order!

04:29.341 --> 04:34.639
I've got a sudden hankering
for baby-back ribs and corn bread.

04:34.639 --> 04:37.022
Oh, I've been looking for you Dr. Crane.

04:37.022 --> 04:40.415
I have a little problem and
they told me you're just the fella

04:40.415 --> 04:41.573
who could fix it.

04:41.573 --> 04:42.951
Oh, I hope I'm not imposing.

04:42.951 --> 04:44.686
Oh, no, don't be silly, Mr. Boone.

04:44.686 --> 04:46.557
Well, actually I prefer "Big Willy."

04:46.557 --> 04:51.052
Don't be silly, Big Willy.

04:51.052 --> 04:53.793
You see, I'm engaged to be married.

04:53.793 --> 04:54.854
Oh, congratulations.

04:54.854 --> 04:56.094
Well, sweet young thing.

04:56.094 --> 04:57.764
Just nuts about me.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.600
Problem is, she smokes.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.845
Oh lord, that is a very bad habit.

05:01.845 --> 05:03.430
Oh, it's a vile habit!

05:03.430 --> 05:06.351
Would have destroyed my affection for her if,

05:06.351 --> 05:11.207
well she didn't possess
certain... compensating gifts.

05:11.207 --> 05:15.848
Anyway, as a favour to me, could you help her?

05:15.848 --> 05:18.255
Well, I'll certainly try.

05:18.255 --> 05:22.671
Just keep in mind, though, addiction
is fraught with many complex issues.

05:22.671 --> 05:25.350
Length of habit, motivation...

05:25.350 --> 05:28.565
Forgive me, sometimes I don't
express myself too clearly.

05:28.565 --> 05:31.855
When I say, "could you help her," 
what I meant to say was

05:31.855 --> 05:33.935
HELP HER!

05:33.935 --> 05:35.261
Consider it done.

05:35.261 --> 05:36.110
Much obliged.

05:36.110 --> 05:38.019
She'll be in touch.

05:38.019 --> 05:43.020
That's me, Dr. Frasier Crane, 
bimbo wrangler.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.263
Frasier, stop it!

05:44.263 --> 05:45.860
This is a golden opportunity!

05:45.860 --> 05:49.062
You makethis little tootsie quit
smoking and we're halfway to syndication.

05:49.062 --> 05:51.029
Did someone just say the word "syndication,"

05:51.029 --> 05:54.244
or do I just hear it every time
I lay eyes on my favorite client?

05:54.244 --> 05:56.682
Oh, Bebe.

05:56.682 --> 05:58.257
Is something wrong, dear?

05:58.257 --> 05:59.068
Well, yes.

05:59.068 --> 06:00.242
We just met Big Willy...

06:00.242 --> 06:01.986
Oh, he thinks I'm some sort of a magician.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.331
He wants me to play therapist 
to his little fiance?

06:04.331 --> 06:07.660
No doubt some gold-digging piranha
so devoid of scruples that

06:07.660 --> 06:09.460
she's willing to rob the coffin and just...

06:09.460 --> 06:12.488
Oh, dear God!

06:12.488 --> 06:14.051
Isn't it wonderful?

06:14.051 --> 06:17.009
We met last month 
and it was love at first sight.

06:17.009 --> 06:21.297
First sight of what -
his bankbook and a cardiogram?

06:21.297 --> 06:22.696
Two minutes.

06:22.696 --> 06:25.081
I'm hurt that she can even joke
about such a thing.

06:25.081 --> 06:28.544
I love that dear sweet old man
with every fibre of my being.

06:28.544 --> 06:29.787
I'm sure you do.

06:29.787 --> 06:31.428
I'm afraid there won't even be a wedding 
if you can't

06:31.428 --> 06:33.051
get rid of that rotten habit, and

06:33.051 --> 06:34.658
he's just ordered me to see that you do!

06:34.658 --> 06:38.657
God, you'd think a touch of
emphysema were the end of the world!

06:38.657 --> 06:41.489
What's that in your hand, woman?

06:41.489 --> 06:46.707
Sorry, pudd'n.  Bebe slipped.

06:46.707 --> 06:50.153
Just that all-important last puff.

06:50.153 --> 06:52.122
Well, see that it is!

06:52.122 --> 06:55.088
Well, Dr. Crane, I'm heading 
out of town for three days.

06:55.088 --> 07:00.195
When I get back on Sunday, I expect
my little gal here to be smoke-free by then.

07:00.195 --> 07:02.594
In... three days?

07:02.594 --> 07:06.616
Now, you do whatever it takes to help her, doc!  
Drugs .. 

07:06.616 --> 07:11.231
straightjackets, electroshock...

07:11.231 --> 07:13.786
You see how he dotes on me.

07:18.282 --> 07:20.512
Excellent progress, Bebe!

07:20.512 --> 07:22.402
You've really dived into the emotional void

07:22.402 --> 07:24.450
that is the route of your addiction.

07:24.450 --> 07:27.136
Your fear of abandonment, your fear
that those you trust will

07:27.136 --> 07:29.366
suddenly turn their backs 
when you expect them to...

07:29.366 --> 07:32.496
Excuse me.

07:32.496 --> 07:36.817
My God, it all seems so clear now.

07:36.817 --> 07:39.090
You're a miracle worker.

07:39.090 --> 07:43.021
If I had a dime for every time... 
well...

07:43.021 --> 07:43.598
Niles!

07:43.598 --> 07:46.658
Hello Frasier, I noticed you
were out of capers the other

07:46.658 --> 07:53.831
night, so I got you this.

07:53.831 --> 07:57.008
Thank you Niles, but why so many?

07:57.008 --> 08:02.974
I just discovered a place called
"Price Buster's Warehouse."

08:02.974 --> 08:05.338
You have to buy in bulk, but the
savings are extraordinary

08:05.338 --> 08:06.848
and they have a huge selection.

08:06.848 --> 08:11.510
I found french fries and french doors 
in the same aisle.

08:11.510 --> 08:14.710
Well, the next time you go back
be sure to buy me a thousand

08:14.710 --> 08:17.458
swordfish so I can use these up!

08:17.458 --> 08:21.334
You laugh, but I could do it like that.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.403
So, how goes the great smoke-out?

08:24.403 --> 08:28.404
Until today, I had no idea what
a brilliant therapist your brother is.

08:28.404 --> 08:32.698
He has tunneled his way into 
the very depths of my psyche.

08:32.698 --> 08:38.500
Well, let's hope he sent a canary down first.

08:38.500 --> 08:42.181
Well, I'll be running along.

08:42.181 --> 08:44.701
I'll see you at ten tomorrow.

08:44.701 --> 08:48.594
In the mean time, it's exercise,
lots of fresh spring water

08:48.594 --> 08:50.734
and nicotine gum for cravings.

08:50.734 --> 08:51.494
That's my girl.

08:51.494 --> 08:53.959
Oh, Bebe, you know I'm writing
a paper on addiction and I'd

08:53.959 --> 08:55.166
love to ask you some questions -

08:55.166 --> 08:58.858
unless there's some reason 
you're eager to be off?

08:58.858 --> 09:05.004
Me?  No.  No, not at all.

09:05.004 --> 09:08.197
Well, I just need to discuss
a personal matter with Frasier first.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.730
Of course, I'll give you some privacy.

09:10.730 --> 09:14.132
It's time for my water anyway.

09:14.132 --> 09:15.171
Yes, Niles?

09:15.171 --> 09:17.035
Let her out that door,
she'll smoke half a pack before the

09:17.035 --> 09:19.220
elevator hits the lobby.

09:19.220 --> 09:20.163
How can you know that?

09:20.163 --> 09:21.010
You hardly spoke to her.

09:21.010 --> 09:23.724
Well, obviously you didn't
see the crazed, cunning glint in her eyes.

09:23.724 --> 09:30.546
She always looks like that, she's an agent.

09:30.546 --> 09:32.313
I know about addiction.

09:32.313 --> 09:38.530
It's the exact same look Maris
used to get during the cough syrup years.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.364
The only way to deal with it is to lock her up,

09:40.364 --> 09:43.241
take her money, and watch her like
a hawk until it's out of her system.

09:43.241 --> 09:45.096
That means she would have
to stay here for the weekend.

09:45.096 --> 09:46.212
Who's staying all weekend?

09:46.212 --> 09:47.401
Bebe Glazer.

09:47.401 --> 09:48.508
Here?

09:48.508 --> 09:49.980
What does she have to stay here for?

09:49.980 --> 09:50.977
She's trying to quit smoking.

09:50.977 --> 09:55.209
Oh great, that means she'll be extra lovable.

09:55.209 --> 09:57.722
Not to worry dad, there is no reason
she has to stay for the weekend.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.658
Bebe and I made a real breakthrough today.

09:59.658 --> 10:01.450
If you don't believe me, 
just come on into the kitchen

10:01.450 --> 10:06.032
and you'll see that I'm right.

10:06.032 --> 10:08.428
I'm sorry I can't stay and help
you with your paper, Niles,

10:08.428 --> 10:10.556
wedding preperations and all.

10:10.556 --> 10:12.229
But I'll remember those helpful hints.

10:12.229 --> 10:21.176
It's exercise, gum, and lots of water.

10:21.176 --> 10:26.291
Water should come in handy for
putting out those pesky purse fires.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.399
All right Niles, secure the door!

10:28.399 --> 10:30.426
Bebe, you are not going anywhere,
you're staying for the weekend.

10:30.426 --> 10:32.306
Now give me that purse.

10:32.306 --> 10:33.367
All right.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.944
Let me remove one very precious momento.

10:36.944 --> 10:38.237
Very well.

10:38.237 --> 10:39.612
Oh, stop it!

10:48.144 --> 10:49.452
More!

10:49.452 --> 10:50.736
What again?

10:50.736 --> 10:51.840
That's her third serving.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.914
Now, now Dad, it's flattering to
Daphne that Bebe finds her food so tasty.

10:55.914 --> 10:57.582
I'm orally fixated.

10:57.582 --> 11:02.087
I could eat a half-stunned wharf
rat if you put some gravy on it!

11:02.087 --> 11:05.479
I'll bear that in mind come breakfast time.

11:05.479 --> 11:06.510
No, please, please.

11:06.510 --> 11:08.385
Let's all try to remain supportive of Bebe.

11:08.385 --> 11:11.024
I think she's really doing rather well.

11:11.024 --> 11:14.465
So, I hear your fiancee is well to do?

11:14.465 --> 11:15.872
Very.

11:15.872 --> 11:20.567
You gonna eat that fat?

11:20.567 --> 11:23.513
Well, marrying money can have it's perils.

11:23.513 --> 11:26.582
Ten or fifteen years down the line,
after you've adapted to a lifestyle

11:26.582 --> 11:29.110
now totally beyond your means,
you can find yourself cast

11:29.110 --> 11:36.493
aside a hollow husk, penniless and crushed.

11:36.493 --> 11:39.141
Niles, Big Willy's eighty-five,
he's on his third pacemaker.

11:39.141 --> 11:40.072
Ah.

11:40.072 --> 11:45.244
Mazel tov!

11:45.244 --> 11:48.708
Just out of curiosity, has
this guy ever seen you eat?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.741
After dinner is the time I need a cigarette most.

11:50.741 --> 11:52.859
As long as I don't stop eating, I'll be fine.

11:52.859 --> 11:53.940
Well, this is very good, Bebe.

11:53.940 --> 11:57.035
You're already identifying those
moments that trigger your worst cravings.

11:57.035 --> 11:57.832
Yeah, yeah!

11:57.832 --> 12:00.535
No, really.  Perhaps it would help
to know that you're not alone.

12:00.535 --> 12:01.799
Dad is an ex-smoker.

12:01.799 --> 12:05.245
Dad, can you tell us about
those moments you crave a cigarette most?

12:05.245 --> 12:07.659
Ah, when I had insomnia.

12:07.659 --> 12:11.215
I'd get up, pour a water glass
full of Bourbon, light a cigarette -

12:11.215 --> 12:14.768
next thing you know, 
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

12:14.768 --> 12:18.446
Nothing relaxes you like a cigarette.

12:18.446 --> 12:24.323
Of course, gives you a hell of
a headache in the morning.

12:24.323 --> 12:28.856
Well, 
I smoked for years but I never became addicted.

12:28.856 --> 12:32.314
To this day, I can buy a pack, 
have a cig or two, toss

12:32.314 --> 12:35.447
them in a drawer 
and not crave another for months.

12:35.447 --> 12:37.648
You know there's a word 
for people who can do that.

12:37.648 --> 12:39.512
What is it?  Oh, yes -

12:39.512 --> 12:45.894
bitch!

12:45.894 --> 12:48.880
There's no need to be insulting
just because you're wrestling

12:48.880 --> 12:51.192
with an unhealthy and disgusting habit.

12:51.192 --> 12:52.094
It isn't disgusting,

12:52.094 --> 12:53.351
it's wonderful!

12:53.351 --> 12:54.749
Oh now, Bebe, tell me.

12:54.749 --> 12:58.815
What is so wonderful about smoking?

12:58.815 --> 13:01.166
Everything.

13:01.166 --> 13:05.721
I like the way 
a fresh firm pack feels in my hand.

13:05.721 --> 13:08.375
I like peeling away 
that little piece of cellophane

13:08.375 --> 13:11.425
and seeing it twinkle in the light.

13:11.425 --> 13:17.200
I like coaxing that first sweet
cylinder out of its hiding place

13:17.200 --> 13:21.446
and bringing it slowly up to my lips.

13:21.446 --> 13:25.385
Striking a match, watching
it burst into  a perfect little flame

13:25.385 --> 13:31.080
and knowing that soon 
that flame will be inside me.

13:31.080 --> 13:34.853
I love the first puff, 
pulling it into my lungs.

13:34.853 --> 13:38.872
Little fingers of smoking filling me, 
caressing me,

13:38.872 --> 13:43.420
feeling that warmth 
penetrate deeper and deeper,

13:43.420 --> 13:46.631
until I think I'm going to burst!

13:46.631 --> 13:57.080
Then - whoosh! - watching it flow
out of me in a lovely, sinuous cloud,

13:57.080 --> 14:06.460
no two ever quite the same.

14:06.460 --> 14:08.241
More potatoes, anyone?

14:52.534 --> 14:53.717
You're up early, Miss Moon.

14:53.717 --> 14:57.687
Oh!  God, you startled me!

14:57.687 --> 15:00.781
Ever since your little speech
about smoking, I haven't been

15:00.781 --> 15:03.612
able to think about anything else.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.437
Please, don't mention this to Dr. Crane.

15:06.437 --> 15:08.566
Silence has its price, dear.

15:08.566 --> 15:11.496
And I think we both know what that is.

15:11.496 --> 15:12.518
Forget it!

15:12.518 --> 15:14.620
You can't make me give you one of these.

15:14.620 --> 15:18.045
Oh... can't I?!

15:18.045 --> 15:19.469
You open up right now!

15:19.469 --> 15:21.133
All right, missy, here's the drill!

15:21.133 --> 15:22.804
You drop those cigarettes, I'll open the door,

15:22.804 --> 15:24.955
you kick 'em over to me, capisce?

15:24.955 --> 15:29.100
No!

15:29.100 --> 15:32.038
Oh, is it cold outside?

15:32.038 --> 15:35.621
All right, you asked for it!

15:35.621 --> 15:37.754
No!  No!  Please, I beg you.

15:37.754 --> 15:40.699
Oh, oh no.  My fingers are getting weak.

15:40.699 --> 15:42.656
Oh, oh, I'm losing my grip.

15:42.656 --> 15:46.053
Stop, please!  I'll give you
anything you want.  I'll...

15:46.053 --> 15:50.046
I'll make you a star!

15:50.046 --> 15:51.394
What the hell's going on out here?

15:51.394 --> 15:54.685
Daphne was smoking!

15:54.685 --> 15:57.108
She made me!

15:57.108 --> 16:00.211
Daphne, give me those.

16:00.211 --> 16:01.222
Oh, look at me!

16:01.222 --> 16:03.268
I'm all damp and chilled to the bone.

16:03.268 --> 16:04.661
I'll get you a towel.

16:04.661 --> 16:07.817
My God, it's five-thirty in the morning!

16:07.817 --> 16:15.707
Dad!

16:15.707 --> 16:18.457
I couldn't sleep.

16:18.457 --> 16:21.090
Have you people all lost your minds?

16:21.090 --> 16:23.911
Alright, now listen, get
back to bed, every one of you!

16:23.911 --> 16:25.162
All right, all right...

16:25.162 --> 16:27.577
Thank god you came in when you did!

16:27.577 --> 16:29.465
She was praying on my weakness.

16:29.465 --> 16:31.903
Who knows what I might have done, probably...

16:31.903 --> 16:32.904
THIS!

16:32.904 --> 16:35.080
Oh, get her!  Stop that woman!

16:35.080 --> 16:37.143
Bebe, you will not be allowed to
smoke a cigarette in this house!

16:37.143 --> 16:39.819
No, no, don't even think about it!

16:39.819 --> 16:40.801
All right, just give me those!

16:40.801 --> 16:42.329
All right now, that's it!

16:42.329 --> 16:43.480
Back to bed!

16:43.480 --> 16:47.982
Oh my God, you're insane, woman!

16:47.982 --> 16:52.001
That's it, no more house guests.

16:52.001 --> 16:53.814
Get off me, you brute!

16:53.814 --> 16:54.472
Hand them over!

16:54.472 --> 16:56.761
Never!

16:56.761 --> 16:59.704
That'll be the neighbours!

16:59.704 --> 17:02.511
Hello?  Oh, hello!

17:02.511 --> 17:04.017
One moment, please.

17:04.017 --> 17:06.667
It's Big Willy!

17:06.667 --> 17:08.378
Big Willy, hello!

17:08.378 --> 17:11.349
No, no, it's not too early, everybody's up!

17:11.349 --> 17:14.358
Well, you know, there have
been a few minor setbacks, but

17:14.358 --> 17:16.861
I'm keeping on top of her, yeah.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.923
Oh yeah, I know she'd love to say hi, hang on.

17:19.923 --> 17:24.893
Hello, pudd'n.  I'm fine, and you?

17:24.893 --> 17:29.836
Oh, nothing's too much trouble
for you daddy.  Bye now!

17:29.836 --> 17:33.005
Yes, sir?  Oh, oh, really?

17:33.005 --> 17:33.685
No, no, I'm very flattered.

17:33.685 --> 17:37.051
Yes, of course, I'd love to,
I'll talk to you this evening.

17:37.051 --> 17:38.444
Bye-bye.

17:38.444 --> 17:39.965
Thank you, Daphne.

17:39.965 --> 17:41.677
All right, now listen up!

17:41.677 --> 17:42.874
He thinks I'm very gifted.

17:42.874 --> 17:43.284
Mmm.

17:43.284 --> 17:44.645
He thinks I'm wasting my talents 
in just one city!

17:44.645 --> 17:46.902
My God, woman, he wants to take
me national, don't you get it?

17:46.902 --> 17:49.084
Unless YOU ruin it for me!

17:49.084 --> 17:52.505
Oh my God, sorry.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.835
Here, take 'em.

17:54.835 --> 17:58.834
I don't know what came over me.

17:58.834 --> 18:01.124
Well, don't be too hard on yourself, Bebe.

18:01.124 --> 18:04.477
After all, addiction to Nicotine
is a very, very difficult... hey,

18:04.477 --> 18:09.165
wait a minute.  This pack is half-empty!

18:09.165 --> 18:11.555
For God's sake... I don't care anymore.

18:11.555 --> 18:13.651
You know, I can't help you, nobody can.

18:13.651 --> 18:14.674
You want to ruin it for both of us?

18:14.674 --> 18:15.173
Here,

18:15.173 --> 18:18.202
go ahead, knock yourself out.

18:18.202 --> 18:22.163
I only wish I could be there when it happens.

18:22.163 --> 18:23.699
When what happens?

18:23.699 --> 18:27.099
When you see that newspaper headline:

18:27.099 --> 18:33.161
"Big Willy Boone, Millionaire, Dead."

18:33.161 --> 18:37.867
Oh, how I wish I could be there
when you watch the funeral on the news.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.929
Watch the casket being slipped into the ground.

18:40.929 --> 18:43.235
Only, you won't be watching that.

18:43.235 --> 18:45.561
No, no, you'll be watching...

18:45.561 --> 18:49.074
the widow Boone.  Tiffany, perhaps.

18:49.074 --> 18:51.524
Oh no, better yet, "Kelli" - with an "I"!

18:51.524 --> 18:54.080
Stop it!

18:54.080 --> 18:56.856
You'll picture her wearing YOUR jewels,

18:56.856 --> 19:00.732
sailing in YOUR yachts, 
sleeping with YOUR gigolos -

19:00.732 --> 19:02.987
but, oh, you won't be sad, no, no, no!

19:02.987 --> 19:06.089
Because you'll have your cigarette.

19:06.089 --> 19:10.346
Yeah!  Clutched in your
nicotine-stained teeth, smoke

19:10.346 --> 19:15.233
whirling about your once-pretty,
now creased, leathery,

19:15.233 --> 19:16.217
smoke-ravaged...

19:16.217 --> 19:18.424
Enough!

19:18.424 --> 19:21.146
God!

19:21.146 --> 19:25.472
You are one hell of a therapist.

19:37.690 --> 19:39.564
Hey, you back from the wedding already?

19:39.564 --> 19:40.553
No.

19:40.553 --> 19:41.779
There was no wedding.

19:41.779 --> 19:44.521
No wedding, no syndication deal...

19:44.521 --> 19:45.705
What's she doing here?

19:45.705 --> 19:47.200
No money, no fame...

19:47.200 --> 19:48.952
Well, you might say things hit a bit of a snag.

19:48.952 --> 19:51.176
No beach house, no pool boys...

19:51.176 --> 19:54.327
Oh will you get a grip, Roz?!

19:54.327 --> 19:55.818
Well, what went wrong?

19:55.818 --> 19:58.403
Well, they were halfway down the aisle -

19:58.403 --> 20:01.768
Big Willy beaming proudly, Bebe radiant,

20:01.768 --> 20:03.056
supporting Big Willy on her arm -

20:03.056 --> 20:05.361
when suddenly he clutched his heart,

20:05.361 --> 20:08.583
and his head slumped against Bebe's shoulder.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.418
Of course we were all concerned
at first, but then suddenly

20:10.418 --> 20:11.416
it seemed like he was all right

20:11.416 --> 20:15.505
because they kept moving on down the aisle.

20:15.505 --> 20:16.927
But if you looked carefully, you could see

20:16.927 --> 20:19.747
Bebe's little biceps bulging 
through her wedding gown,

20:19.747 --> 20:25.770
and I swear I noticed daylight
between Big Willy's dress boots and the carpet.

20:25.770 --> 20:28.769
Well, once they got up to the
minister the jig was pretty well up,

20:28.769 --> 20:32.022
despite Bebe's valiant attempts
to animate his features by

20:32.022 --> 20:37.623
twisting the loose skin at the back of his neck.

20:37.623 --> 20:40.559
You know, I've never seen a woman more crushed.

20:40.559 --> 20:43.641
Well, if I were you I'd get
her away from that balcony rail.

20:43.641 --> 20:46.104
The doorman gets ticked if you
even through a piece of gum

20:46.104 --> 20:50.567
over the side.

20:50.567 --> 20:54.168
Bebe, dear?  Please, come on in.

20:54.168 --> 20:55.814
That's a girl.

20:55.814 --> 20:57.481
All right, let me have a look at you.

20:57.481 --> 21:02.208
Come on, here we are.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.429
Well, I don't really blame you, dear.

21:04.429 --> 21:07.408
You know, Roz and I are both upset too.

21:07.408 --> 21:09.964
You know, look at it this way: at least

21:09.964 --> 21:12.615
you're no worse off than you were before.

21:12.615 --> 21:14.598
You don't know the things I did for that man -

21:14.598 --> 21:21.277
the depraved, 
Western-themed appetites I satisfied!

21:21.277 --> 21:24.077
He was eighty-five, 
how bad could it have been?

21:24.077 --> 21:28.315
Ever worn a saddle?

21:28.315 --> 21:31.662
Do I have to answer that?

21:31.662 --> 21:34.144
Well, you know, Bebe, there are
other Big Willys out there,

21:34.144 --> 21:35.213
better ones!

21:35.213 --> 21:37.007
Richer, older...

21:37.007 --> 21:38.990
Impotent!

21:38.990 --> 21:43.934
Oh dear, you always know what to say.

21:43.934 --> 21:46.982
I know what hell 
I put you through over this.

21:46.982 --> 21:49.555
I insist that you take this,

21:49.555 --> 21:51.564
as a small token of my gratitude.

21:51.564 --> 21:53.427
Oh Bebe, really...

21:53.427 --> 21:56.126
Look, Roz!  It's a gold Rolex!

21:56.126 --> 21:58.519
Oh my goodness...

21:58.519 --> 22:02.319
Bebe... where did you get this?

22:02.319 --> 22:05.418
Just don't wear it to the funeral.
