IF IT'S THIS RICH WACKO

10:54.570 --> 10:56.072
SHE WAS PRIVATE-DUTY
NURSING FOR.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.573
WHEN YOU SPOKE TO HER, TOM,

10:57.657 --> 10:59.492
DID SHE INDICATE SHE FELT
THIS GUY WAS DANGEROUS?

10:59.575 --> 11:02.620
SHE SAID ON HIS MEDICATION
HE WAS UNDER CONTROL.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.413
HE SEEM UNDER CONTROL
WHEN YOU SAW HIM?

11:04.497 --> 11:06.582
HE WASN'T FOAMING
AT THE MOUTH OR ANYTHING.

11:08.250 --> 11:12.088
SHE WAS A SWEET GIRL.
I MEAN, A GOOD,
SWEET PERSON.

11:12.129 --> 11:16.592
YEAH. LOOK, WE'LL
KEEP YOU POSTED, HUH?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.428
HEY, WHAT ABOUT
THIS ACTOR IDIOT
SHE USED TO GO OUT WITH?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.097
HE'S WHO GAVE US
THE NUT JOB.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.099
WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF THE ACTOR?

11:23.182 --> 11:24.266
JUST SEEMED
LIKE A LOSER.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.227
HE TAKE THEIR BREAKUP
HARD, OR WHAT?

11:26.268 --> 11:27.770
SHE DIDN'T SAY THAT,
DARLENE.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.730
WAS HE OFF
HIS MEDICATION,
THE OTHER ONE?

11:31.148 --> 11:32.566
WE'RE JUST GETTING INTO IT
RIGHT NOW, TOMMY.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.068
WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA
KEEP YOU POSTED.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.778
I REALLY WISH
YOU GUYS WOULD.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.739
YOU KNOW HOW YOU REALIZE

11:38.781 --> 11:41.617
COUPLE OF THINGS CHANGE,
YOUR WHOLE LIFE WOULD BE
DIFFERENT?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.619
SURE.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.581
I WENT INTO THE SERVICE
STRAIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL,

11:47.623 --> 11:49.709
OR DARLENE AND ME
WOULD'VE GOT MARRIED.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.795
SORRY, RICHARDSON.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.922
THANKS, ANDY.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.674
BYE.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.407
I THINK
THAT YOU CAN SEE

12:21.490 --> 12:22.575
I'M TRYING
TO COOPERATE.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.076
WE'RE THE BOTH OF US
IMPRESSED BY THAT, JASON.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.662
WE'RE UP ON
THE SECOND FLOOR NOW.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.372
YEP. HERE WE ARE.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.750
WHAT WE'RE GONNA
DO NOW, JASON,

12:30.833 --> 12:33.586
IS I'M GONNA BE,
UH, TAKING YOU INTO
AN INTERVIEW ROOM.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.212
EXACTLY WHAT YOU TOLD ME
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.631
THAT'S WHAT WE TOLD YOU,
AND, UH, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.593
AND WHILE
I TAKE YOU IN THERE,
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ HERE,

12:40.676 --> 12:43.554
HE'S GONNA GET YOU
ANY TYPE OF REFRESHMENT
THAT YOU MAY WANT.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.097
GONNA HAVE A LITTLE CHAT
WITH OUR BOSS MAYBE.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.349
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL HIM
I'VE CONFESSED?

12:47.391 --> 12:48.768
WHAT DID WE SAY
ABOUT THAT?

12:48.851 --> 12:51.312
WHAT WAS OUR DEAL
THAT WE MADE
ABOUT THAT?

12:51.353 --> 12:54.732
THAT'S RIGHT. I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT AGAIN
UNTIL YOU GET ME SITUATED.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.317
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
SITUATED,

12:56.358 --> 12:58.444
DO IT ABSOLUTELY
BY THE NUMBERS.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.029
THE THING IS...

13:01.322 --> 13:03.115
I LIKED DARLENE SO MUCH,

13:03.199 --> 13:05.326
AND I FEEL
A CORRESPONDING REMORSE.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.287
ABSOLUTELY YOU SHOULD
HOLD THAT CONCEPT.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.247
CAN DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ
GET YOU ANYTHING
TO DRINK?

13:10.331 --> 13:13.709
NO. I DON'T WANT
ANY REFRESHMENT
UNTIL I'VE CONFESSED.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.420
OK.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.131
HERE WE GO, JASON.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.053
HOW'S IT GOING,
DOLORES?

13:24.094 --> 13:25.054
GOOD.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.472
HOW'S YOURSELF?

13:26.555 --> 13:29.058
I <i>WOULD </i>BE GOOD
IF I DIDN'T KNOW

13:29.141 --> 13:31.101
SOMETHING WAS GONNA
LOUSE THIS UP,

13:31.185 --> 13:33.562
AND BECAUSE I KNOW SOMETHING
IS GONNA LOUSE THIS UP,

13:33.646 --> 13:36.023
I WANT TO EXPRESS NOW
MY STRONG FEELING

13:36.065 --> 13:38.609
THIS IS HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT
WAS MEANT TO BE CONDUCTED.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.152
THE NUT JOB WAS
AT THE HOSPITAL.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.946
OH, HE WAS AT THE HOSPITAL,

13:42.029 --> 13:43.906
IN THE NUT FLOOR WAITING ROOM
WHEN WE ARRIVED.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.908
HE HEARS US
IDENTIFY OURSELVES,

13:45.991 --> 13:48.577
PRESENTS HIMSELF
TO BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.621
AND HE ADMITTED
HE KILLED HER.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.748
BETWEEN THE NUT HOUSE
AND THE STATION HOUSE,

13:52.832 --> 13:55.918
ADMITTED HE KILLED HER,
I WOULD SAY, A MINIMUM
OF 5 TIMES.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.503
YOU GIVE HIM
HIS RIGHTS?

13:57.586 --> 13:59.421
I HAVE GIVEN THIS GUY
HIS RIGHTS SO OFTEN

13:59.505 --> 14:04.093
I MAY NOW BE EVEN WITH
HOW MANY SUSPECTS I'VE
QUESTIONED IN MY CAREER.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.554
W-WE DON'T HAVE TO NOTIFY
THE FAMILY OR ANYTHING,
RIGHT?

14:06.595 --> 14:08.180
IT'S NOT OUR JOB
TO DETERMINE
HIS COMPETENCE.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.890
NO.

14:09.932 --> 14:15.604
LET ME NOW REJOIN BOBBY
AND OUR SUSPECT JASON.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.107
JASON'S WITHHOLDING
REFRESHMENTS
FROM HIMSELF

14:18.190 --> 14:20.276
TO FORCE HIMSELF
TO GIVE A STATEMENT.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.610
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ?

14:22.778 --> 14:24.530
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:25.781 --> 14:27.491
CAN WE TALK
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

14:27.575 --> 14:29.618
I'M WORKING RIGHT NOW.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.161
CAN I HELP YOU?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.621
NO. IT'S PERSONAL.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.207
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ
IS INVESTIGATING A HOMICIDE,

14:35.291 --> 14:37.793
SO IF IT'S PERSONAL,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE IT UP
WITH HIM SOMEWHERE ELSE.

14:37.835 --> 14:38.919
ALL RIGHT.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.130
I'M DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ'S
PHYSICIAN,

14:41.171 --> 14:44.258
AND IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT HE AND I SPEAK.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.759
COME HERE.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.146
YOU GOT BALLS
COMING HERE.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.189
I'M SORRY TO PUT YOU
IN AN AWKWARD POSITION,

14:59.273 --> 15:01.609
BUT I DON'T SEE
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN ME
MANY CHOICES.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.193
YOU DON'T, HUH?

15:03.277 --> 15:05.112
YOU TOLD ME NOT TO
TALK TO YOUR WIFE
ABOUT YOUR CONDITION,

15:05.154 --> 15:06.739
SO I CAN'T
LEAVE A MESSAGE
AT YOUR HOME,

15:06.822 --> 15:09.158
AND ALL THE MESSAGES
THAT I'VE LEFT HERE
GO UNANSWERED.

15:09.199 --> 15:12.161
LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THE CHOICE
THAT LEAVES YOU, DR. TALBOT.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.330
DON'T CALL,

15:14.371 --> 15:16.373
DON'T LEAVE
NO MORE MESSAGES,

15:16.457 --> 15:19.126
AND DON'T YOU EVER
COME HERE AGAIN.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.170
LOOK, I KNOW THAT THIS
IS PAINFUL FOR YOU,

15:21.253 --> 15:23.547
BUT I FEEL THAT I HAVE
A PROFESSIONAL
OBLIGATION

15:23.631 --> 15:25.507
TO HELP YOU CONFRONT
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.052
THAT'S CRAP.
IT'S UP TO ME
WHAT I WANT TO DO,

15:28.135 --> 15:30.763
AND THAT DON'T INCLUDE
TALKING TO YOU
IN THIS HOUSE.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.348
LOOK, JUST CALM DOWN
A LITTLE BIT--

15:32.389 --> 15:34.892
CALM DOWN?!
YOU WANT TO SEE ME ANGRY?

15:34.975 --> 15:36.769
YOU WANT TO SEE ME
GET ANGRY?!

15:36.852 --> 15:37.853
HMM?

15:37.895 --> 15:39.730
ARE YOU
THREATENING ME?

15:39.813 --> 15:42.566
I'M TELLING YOU,
I'M WORKING HERE,

15:42.650 --> 15:44.818
AND I DON'T WANT
TO TALK NO MORE.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.071
NOW YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.920
THIS IS NOT INEVITABLY
A DEATH SENTENCE.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.713
DO YOU THINK
I'M KIDDING?

16:04.797 --> 16:05.714
NO.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.674
NO.
HMM?

16:08.550 --> 16:11.053
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.357
[BREATHING HARD]

16:23.399 --> 16:24.900
OHH...

16:33.742 --> 16:36.161
SIT DOWN.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.628
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD US
THE TRUTH BEFORE.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.714
I THINK YOU HAD DOPE
IN THAT BACKPACK.

16:46.755 --> 16:50.175
HUH? I TOLD YOU
I HAD MY SWEATER
AND MY WALKMAN IN THERE.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.428
AND DON'T FORGET
YOUR HAIR GEL.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.595
YEAH, MY HAIR GEL.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.888
WE GOT YOUR SHEET BACK,
GABE.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.348
YOU TOOK A POP FOR DEALING.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.893
GABE...

17:01.270 --> 17:03.397
I THINK YOU KNEW
THE BIKE MESSENGER,

17:03.439 --> 17:05.274
AND I THINK YOU KNOW
WHO SHOT HIM.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.568
WE JUST WANT SOME HELP.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.112
WE'RE NOT LOOKIN'
TO LOCK YOU UP
ABOUT THE DRUGS.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.114
I SWEAR TO YOU,
I NEVER SAW
THE BIKE RIDER BEFORE.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.199
I DON'T KNOW HIM.
I DON'T KNOW
WHY HE DID IT.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.784
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.453
HOW ABOUT THE THIEF?

17:17.494 --> 17:18.495
I DON'T KNOW HIM
EITHER.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.372
GABE, WE GET BURNED
BY JERKS LIKE YOU,

17:20.456 --> 17:23.250
WE FORM GRUDGES,
AND THEN GOD HELP YOU.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.543
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

17:25.919 --> 17:29.590
BUT YOU HAD SOMETHING WRONG
IN THAT BACKPACK.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.302
[CLEARS THROAT]

17:33.343 --> 17:37.056
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
I HAD SOMETHING
IN THE BACKPACK.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.223
COKE?

17:39.516 --> 17:42.644
I HELPED BRING A COUPLE
PEOPLE TOGETHER.
THAT'S ALL.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.729
OK.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.065
NOW, THE GUY
WHO STOLE IT,

17:46.148 --> 17:48.067
HE HAD TO KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE INTO

17:48.150 --> 17:51.028
'CAUSE HE MADE
A PRETTY GOOD GUESS
WHAT YOU WERE CARRYING.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.988
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO THINK HARD.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.074
YOU EVER SEE HIM BEFORE?

17:56.617 --> 17:57.701
MAYBE.

17:57.785 --> 18:01.080
HE LOOKED KIND OF
LIKE THIS GUY
I SEEN.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.081
WHERE?

18:02.164 --> 18:04.041
WHERE'D YOU SEE HIM?

18:04.124 --> 18:07.086
HE LOOKS LIKE THIS GUY
I SEEN A TIME OR TWO

18:07.169 --> 18:08.504
WITH THIS COLOMBIAN.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.005
HIS NAME IS GALVEZ.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.634
HE RUNS A CREW
OVER ON AVENUE C.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.594
WHERE ON AVENUE C?

18:15.677 --> 18:17.346
THIRD.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.389
WHERE ALL THAT
ACTION IS.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.310
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO DOWN THERE WITH US.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.020
NO, NOT ME, MAN. NO.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.438
NOBODY'S GONNA SEE YOU.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.482
YOU'D JUST HAVE TO
POINT HIM OUT.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.568
I WON'T POINT HIM OUT
IN COURT.

18:34.154 --> 18:37.074
YEAH, BUT I'LL
POINT HIM OUT.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.121
CAN WE START?

18:44.540 --> 18:48.168
FIRST WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU
INITIAL ON THIS FORM

18:48.210 --> 18:50.504
THAT YOU
UNDERSTAND EACH RIGHT
AS I TELL IT TO YOU.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.964
I CAN INITIAL THEM
WHILE I TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.091
LET HIM GO THROUGH
YOUR RIGHTS NOW.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.219
YOU CAN REMAIN SILENT.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.513
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
AND DECLINE YOUR RIGHT?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.181
YES.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.350
OK.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.228
INITIAL THE BOX.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.939
YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

19:09.022 --> 19:09.940
DECLINE.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.775
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT RIGHT?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.068
I UNDERSTAND
AND DECLINE.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.988
INITIAL THE BOX.

19:16.071 --> 19:19.199
IF YOU WANT AN ATTORNEY
AND CANNOT AFFORD ONE--

19:19.241 --> 19:21.201
NO. I HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL
TRUST FUND.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.995
IF YOU WANT AN ATTORNEY
AND CAN'T AFFORD ONE,

19:23.078 --> 19:24.621
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED
TO YOU

19:24.705 --> 19:26.123
AND WILL REPRESENT YOU
FREE OF CHARGE.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.250
I'LL INITIAL NO.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.835
THEN ANYTHING
THAT YOU TELL US

19:29.918 --> 19:31.086
COULD BE USED AGAINST YOU
IN COURT.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.963
DECLINE.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.674
THAT YOU DON'T DECLINE.
YOU SAY "I UNDERSTAND."

19:35.757 --> 19:37.009
I UNDERSTAND.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.677
INITIAL THE BOX.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.930
I ALREADY DID.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.515
SIGN AT THE BOTTOM.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.267
WITH PLEASURE.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.729
Simone: OK, JASON,
JUST TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.690
DARLENE WAS MY NURSE
AT LAFAYETTE HOSPITAL,

19:51.773 --> 19:54.401
WHERE YOU AND I
JUST MET.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.527
MM-HMM.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.946
AND WE HAD FORMED
A FRIENDSHIP,

19:58.030 --> 20:00.574
AND, ACTUALLY,
DARLENE HAD A CRUSH
ON ME.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.367
THOUGHT
I WAS ATTRACTIVE.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.454
EACH NIGHT,
AFTER HER SHIFT,

20:05.537 --> 20:07.289
I WOULD VISIT
DARLENE.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.124
AND SOMETIMES
WE'D CABARET,

20:09.208 --> 20:11.251
AND SOMETIMES
WE'D STAY IN.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.836
MM-HMM.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.839
WELL, DID YOU AND DARLENE
HAVE ANY KIND OF
DISAGREEMENTS?

20:15.923 --> 20:17.341
I CAN ONLY SAY

20:17.424 --> 20:19.635
THAT I STOPPED TAKING
MY MEDICATION.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.472
ALTHOUGH, WHAT'S CRAZY

20:23.513 --> 20:26.308
IS THAT I THOUGHT
I WAS STILL
TAKING IT.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.977
SO YOU GOT CONFUSED.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.979
I MUST HAVE KEPT IT
UNDER MY TONGUE

20:31.021 --> 20:33.023
AND PRETENDED
TO SWALLOW IT

20:33.106 --> 20:35.525
AND THEN SPIT IT OUT
LATER.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.569
WHICH IS WHEN I HAVE
DELUSIONAL EPISODES.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.154
ALL RIGHT, JASON,

20:39.196 --> 20:42.157
WHAT LED UP TO
YOU STRANGLING DARLENE?

20:45.285 --> 20:47.621
I REMEMBER
SEEING HER DEAD...

20:47.663 --> 20:49.706
AT 2 A.M. THIS MORNING.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.626
UH, LETTING MYSELF IN,

20:52.668 --> 20:54.628
SEEING WHAT I HAD DONE.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.840
HE IS ASKING
WHAT LED UP TO
YOU KILLING HER.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.842
I MUST HAVE BEEN
DELUSIONAL.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.678
WHAT KIND OF DELUSIONS?

21:02.719 --> 21:05.389
I'LL HEAR VOICES,

21:05.472 --> 21:08.850
OR IF SOME PEOPLE
CIRCULATE A LIST
OF RICH PEOPLE

21:08.934 --> 21:11.144
TO BE ROBBED
IN TIMES SQUARE.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.188
THAT KIND OF THING.

21:13.230 --> 21:17.067
SO DID YOU THINK
THAT DARLENE WAS
CONSPIRING AGAINST YOU?

21:17.150 --> 21:19.569
NO, NO.
NO, THAT'S ONE THING
I KNOW FOR SURE.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.446
SHE WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.990
SO WHAT PISSED YOU OFF?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.451
Simone: JASON?

21:26.535 --> 21:29.121
YOU DO REMEMBER
KILLING DARLENE, RIGHT?

21:32.416 --> 21:33.375
LET'S SAY I DO.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.710
LET'S <i>SAY </i>YOU DO?

21:34.751 --> 21:36.878
I KNOW I KILLED HER.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.047
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.383
YOU GONNA CLAIM
BLACKOUT NOW?
IS THAT WHERE WE'RE GOING?

21:41.425 --> 21:43.468
NO. I KNOW
I MUST HAVE KILLED HER.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.053
WHAT HAPPENED AFTERWARDS?

21:45.095 --> 21:47.097
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED AFTERWARDS?

21:47.180 --> 21:50.100
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH HER?
MAYBE YOU TIED HER UP?

21:50.183 --> 21:52.185
SHE SAID SHE WASN'T
FEELING WELL.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.187
I KNOW
I WAS DISAPPOINTED

21:54.229 --> 21:56.064
THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO GO OUT,

21:56.106 --> 21:59.609
SO I TOOK A WALK,
OVER BY THE SEAPORT
MUSEUM

21:59.693 --> 22:01.236
AND IN THAT
GENERAL AREA.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.779
AND THEN, FINALLY,

22:02.863 --> 22:05.782
I WENT TO
A DUANE REED
DRUGSTORE...

22:05.866 --> 22:08.452
AND BOUGHT HER A LOT
OF COLD REMEDIES.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.620
OSCILLOCOCCINUM...

22:10.704 --> 22:12.372
UH...ECHINACEA.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.249
YOU TOOK THAT UP TO HER?

22:14.291 --> 22:16.209
I TOOK IT UP,
AND I FOUND HER DEAD.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.628
HE'S ASKING WHAT YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU SAW HER ALIVE.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.089
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
THE DAY BEFORE,

22:21.131 --> 22:24.092
AND THEN LAST NIGHT
SHE SAID SHE WASN'T
FEELING WELL.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.469
SON OF A BITCH.
SON OF A BITCH!

22:25.552 --> 22:27.095
WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:27.137 --> 22:29.306
SO YOU'RE NOT CONFESSING
TO NOTHIN'?

22:29.389 --> 22:31.975
LISTEN, I SET MY
BROTHER'S HOUSE ON FIRE
4 YEARS AGO.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.144
I HAVE HAD
OVER 3 SEPARATE
TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS

22:34.227 --> 22:36.855
THAT WERE MY FAULT
AND I DIDN'T MIND
HAPPEN.

22:36.938 --> 22:39.608
I KNOW I MUST HAVE
KILLED HER.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.943
AND ALL THOSE THINGS
HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE
OFF MEDICATION.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.362
YES!

22:43.445 --> 22:44.780
BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE
IF YOU HAVE BEEN
OFF MEDICATION

22:44.821 --> 22:46.281
THESE LAST 2 WEEKS.

22:48.658 --> 22:49.618
I MUST HAVE BEEN.

22:49.659 --> 22:50.869
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.579
SHE WAS
A VERY SWEET GIRL,

22:52.621 --> 22:54.623
AND SHE WAS
THE FIRST PERSON
TO BE KIND TO ME

22:54.664 --> 22:55.624
IN A VERY LONG TIME.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.626
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.628
THIS IS HOW I REPAY HER!

23:07.094 --> 23:08.637
I KNEW THIS WOULD
SCREW UP.

23:08.678 --> 23:11.139
TOLD US ALL THEM TIMES
THAT HE DID IT.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.974
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?
I TELL YOU THIS WOULD
SCREW UP?

23:13.016 --> 23:14.226
HE GAVE YOU NOTHING
ON THE WAY OVER

23:14.309 --> 23:15.727
THAT PUTS HIMSELF THERE
KILLING HER?

23:15.811 --> 23:17.437
HE JUST KEPT SAYING
HE DID IT.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.647
AND I KEPT ON
GIVING HIM HIS RIGHTS.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.565
WELL, MAYBE IT'LL
COME BACK TO HIM.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.609
HE'S NUTS.
WE'RE AS LIABLE
TO GO BACK IN THERE,

23:22.651 --> 23:24.152
AND HE'LL BE NAPOLEON.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.320
HEY, TOMMY.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.696
HEY. DID I HEAR
YOU PICKED THE GUY UP?

23:26.780 --> 23:28.281
YEAH. WE'RE TALKING
TO HIM NOW.

23:28.323 --> 23:29.991
DID HE GO FOR
KILLING DARLENE?

23:30.033 --> 23:32.369
SAYS HE MUST HAVE,
BUT HE DON'T REMEMBER.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.579
WHAT IS THAT,
SOME STINKIN' TRICK
TO PLEAD INSANE?

23:34.663 --> 23:37.082
AS FAR AS THAT GOES,
HE SEEMS PRETTY NUTTY.

23:37.165 --> 23:39.709
HE'S NOT GETTING AWAY WITH THIS.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.378
IF HE DID THIS,
HE'S GOIN' DOWN FOR IT.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.255
HEY, RELAX, TOM.
TAKE IT EASY.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.506
HOW AM I GONNA
TAKE IT EASY?

23:44.548 --> 23:46.508
NO ONE SAYS
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE UPSET.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.801
LET US DO OUR JOBS.

23:47.843 --> 23:51.304
YEAH, A-A-ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

23:51.346 --> 23:53.849
YOU GUYS DO YOUR JOBS.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.147
ALL ELSE FAILS
WITH NAPOLEON,

24:00.188 --> 24:03.066
WE CAN TURN RICHARDSON
LOOSE ON HIM.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.140
MORNING, ANDY.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.141
HOW'S IT GOING?

24:36.224 --> 24:37.309
WHERE'S THIS ONE?

24:37.392 --> 24:40.103
HE'S UPSTAIRS
LOOKING AT YOUR PSYCHO.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.022
HE DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'
TO HIMSELF?

24:42.105 --> 24:44.024
NO. SHANNON WATCHED HIM
DURING THE NIGHT.

24:44.107 --> 24:45.984
SAID HE SEEMED HAPPY ENOUGH
TO BE THERE.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.527
PROBABLY
MORE COMFORTABLE THERE

24:47.611 --> 24:49.779
THAN HIS ORIGINAL
RESIDENCE ON MARS.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.782
SO, UM, I HOPE
EVERYTHING TURNED OUT
ALL RIGHT YESTERDAY

24:52.824 --> 24:54.242
WITH THAT DOCTOR.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.164
YEAH.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.165
GOOD.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.541
GOOD MORNING, ANDY.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.667
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

25:02.751 --> 25:03.919
HOW'S NAPOLEON?

25:03.960 --> 25:07.214
DON'T REMEMBER NO MORE
THAN HE DID YESTERDAY.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.090
YOU GOTTA LIKE HIM
FOR KILLING HER.

25:09.132 --> 25:11.092
NO FORCED ENTRY
RULES OUT A STRANGER,

25:11.134 --> 25:13.011
AND THAT
PAIN-IN-THE-ASS ACTOR,

25:13.094 --> 25:15.013
HE AIN'T GOT THE BALLS.

25:15.096 --> 25:17.015
SHOULD WE BE LOOKING
AT TOMMY RICHARDSON?

25:18.683 --> 25:21.228
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HIS MOTIVES
WOULD BE.

25:21.311 --> 25:24.731
UH, UNLESS MAYBE
BEING INVOLVED WITH
THE D.O.A.,

25:24.814 --> 25:26.983
SHE'S PRESSURING HIM
TO LEAVE HIS WIFE.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.653
BUT IF THEY'D BEEN INVOLVED,
YOU'D THINK THE ACTOR
WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT TOMMY.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.614
PLUS NONE OF THEM
BUSYBODY NEIGHBORS
MENTIONED THEM.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.075
HAS THE PSYCHO SAID WE CAN
TALK TO HIS DOCTOR?

25:35.158 --> 25:36.076
OH, YEAH,
HE GAVE PERMISSION.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.160
OH, GOD.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.495
WELL, WE GOTTA
TALK TO HIM, ANDY.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.372
DOES THE GUY
HAVE A HISTORY
OF MEMORY BLACKOUTS?

25:40.455 --> 25:43.041
DEFINITELY.
LET'S TALK TO THEM
PHONY SONS OF BITCHES.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.417
DOES HE COOPERATE
TAKING HIS MEDS?

25:44.501 --> 25:46.044
DID I SAY
LET'S TALK TO HIM?

25:46.127 --> 25:47.337
ALSO, I GOT THE NURSES
THAT YOU WORKED WITH.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.838
HERE, I'LL TALK
TO THE NURSES.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.966
YOU CAN TALK
TO THOSE ASSHOLES.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.141
[SIGHS]

26:07.524 --> 26:09.276
[GROANING]

26:12.112 --> 26:14.030
PUT THAT OUT.
IT'S AFFECTING MY SINUSES.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.616
GOTTA DO SOMETHING
WHILE I'M SITTING HERE.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.034
WHY YOU GOTTA DO
SOMETHING?

26:18.118 --> 26:19.536
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE?

26:19.578 --> 26:20.745
BE WHAT?

26:20.829 --> 26:22.747
JUST BE WHAT YOU ARE.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.083
I AM BEING WHAT I AM.
I'M A SMOKER.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.298
HEY, THAT'S HIM.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.800
THAT'S THE GUY.
THE ONE IN
THE BLACK JACKET--

26:33.883 --> 26:35.802
HE'S THE GUY
THAT STOLE MY BACKPACK.

26:35.885 --> 26:37.721
2 HISPANIC MALES
COMING OUT OF THE BUILDING.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.639
OUR MAN'S IN
THE BLACK JACKET.

26:39.723 --> 26:40.640
LET'S GO.

26:40.724 --> 26:41.891
STAY HERE WITH GABE.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.115

26:57.198 --> 26:58.700
COPS!

26:58.742 --> 27:00.201
POLICE! HOLD IT!

27:00.243 --> 27:02.495
HOLD IT!

27:02.579 --> 27:04.331
TURN AROUND!

27:04.414 --> 27:07.083
GET YOUR HANDS
ON THE FENCE!
GET OVER THERE!

27:07.125 --> 27:08.960
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:11.963 --> 27:14.049
HARDEST COAT
IN THE WORLD
TO GET CUFFS ON.

27:14.090 --> 27:15.342
YEAH, I GOT IT.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.509
HE'S CLEAN.
DO YOU WANT HIM?

27:16.593 --> 27:18.011
TAKE A WALK.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.387
Medavoy:
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

27:19.429 --> 27:21.765
HUH?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

27:21.806 --> 27:23.767
MAYBE THAT ONE'S
TOO TOUGH FOR HIM.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.770
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
STARTED WITH
"WHAT TIME IS IT?"

27:35.111 --> 27:36.571
UH, YEAH. 2:00's GOOD.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.365
LOOK, IT'S REALLY
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.866
GREAT.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.118
I APPRECIATE
YOUR COOPERATION.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.332
HOW'S IT GOIN'?
UH, HANG ON JUST A SECOND.

27:47.415 --> 27:48.875
I DON'T LIKE BEING
IN THOSE PLACES

27:48.958 --> 27:50.460
ANY MORE THAN
I HAVE TO, YOU KNOW?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.796
YOU MIND WE SPEAK
SOMEWHERES ELSE?

27:52.837 --> 27:54.756
ANDY.

27:54.798 --> 27:58.218
YEAH, I KNOW WHERE
THE ACROPOLIS IS.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.387
OK. THANKS A LOT.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.973
HARRISON FORD.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.518
I'M SEEING THE NUT JOB'S
PSYCHIATRIST AT 2:00.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.269
WHEN YOU NOTIFIED HER
IN WORCESTER,

28:08.311 --> 28:10.605
DIDN'T THE D.O.A.'s
MOTHER SAY THAT SHE
WAS AN ONLY CHILD?

28:10.647 --> 28:11.981
COME ON OVER, LARRY.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.942
WHO SAYS SHE'S NOT?

28:13.983 --> 28:16.152
THIS NURSE SAYS
THE D.O.A. HAD A BROTHER
AND THEY WERE CLOSE.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.530
WHAT, ARE YOU REFERRING
TO DARLENE'S BROTHER?

28:18.613 --> 28:19.656
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIM?

28:19.739 --> 28:21.324
THAT'S WHAT I CAME
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.659
TO SAY WHAT?

28:22.701 --> 28:23.743
JUST THAT HE TALKED TO ME
A COUPLE TIMES,

28:23.827 --> 28:25.328
AND HE WAS REALLY
PROTECTIVE OF HER,

28:25.370 --> 28:28.331
AND IF SHE BEGAN
TO DATE SOMEONE ELSE,
I BET HE'D KNOW WHO.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.875
I-I'LL BE BACK
IN JUST A SECOND.

28:42.011 --> 28:44.305
YOU WANT A COFFEE
OR SOMETHING?

28:44.347 --> 28:46.766
NO, THANKS.

28:50.353 --> 28:54.357
SO, UH, DID YOU DO
A PERFORMANCE
LAST NIGHT?

28:54.399 --> 28:56.860
MM-MMM.
MONDAY NIGHTS ARE DARK.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.363
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DARK?

29:00.405 --> 29:02.866
NO PERFORMANCES.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.534
UH-HUH.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.287
YOU, UH,

29:09.330 --> 29:13.126
UH, <i>SLEUTH</i>

<i>SLEUTH.</i>

29:13.209 --> 29:14.127
OH, YEAH?
HOW WAS THAT?

29:14.210 --> 29:15.670
STUPID.

29:18.715 --> 29:22.343
CHECK THAT OUT, LARRY.
SEE IF YOU RECOGNIZE ANYBODY.

29:25.054 --> 29:26.222
YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.307
WHO DO YOU RECOGNIZE?

29:27.390 --> 29:29.476
THAT'S DARLENE'S BROTHER.
WHAT GROUP IS THAT?

29:29.559 --> 29:30.602
IS THAT SOME KIND OF
A SOFTBALL OUTING?

29:30.685 --> 29:32.604
PICNIC LAST YEAR LABOR DAY,

29:32.687 --> 29:34.439
FOR THE UNIFORM COPS
IN OUR PRECINCT.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.742

29:45.784 --> 29:47.786
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

29:52.207 --> 29:56.127
WHAT IF SOMEONE PUTS UP
BAIL FOR JOE BLOW?

29:56.211 --> 29:57.754
HOW AM I GONNA KNOW

30:00.131 --> 30:02.258
YOU'RE STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF, FELLA!

30:08.807 --> 30:11.184
YOU'RE IN VERY
SERIOUS TROUBLE.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.480
NOW, I THINK
YOU'RE MAN ENOUGH

30:15.563 --> 30:18.107

MEET US HALFWAY,

30:19.651 --> 30:21.152

30:28.910 --> 30:30.703
WANT SOMETHING
TO DRINK?

30:41.256 --> 30:43.341
HOW ABOUT TELLING ME
YOUR NAME?

30:46.302 --> 30:48.930
THERE GOES THE REST
OF YOUR PEPSI.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.185
BACK IN THE CAGE.
GO ON.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.611
KEEP IT DOWN.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.785

31:10.827 --> 31:13.413
LET'S TRY FOR LIFTS

31:15.039 --> 31:16.666
THAT'S VERY CLEVER, JILL.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.293
YEAH. WE'LL FIND OUT

31:18.334 --> 31:20.670

31:21.754 --> 31:23.965

31:45.612 --> 31:47.113

31:47.155 --> 31:48.364
I CAME IN EARLY.
I WAS HOPING
I'D GET CAUGHT UP

31:48.406 --> 31:49.699
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH DARLENE'S HOMICIDE.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.659
WHAT, ARE YOU DOIN'
A 4:00-TO-12:00?

31:51.701 --> 31:53.036
YEAH. I CAME IN EARLY.

31:53.119 --> 31:54.537
LET'S GO IN HERE,

31:54.621 --> 31:56.623
AWAY FROM PRYING EYES.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.833
P.A.A. SAID YOU WENT
TO THE HOSPITAL,

31:58.875 --> 32:00.168
THIS GUY TURNED
HIMSELF IN.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.878
YEAH. HERE WE GO.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.632
DID THAT WACKO'S DOCTOR
TALK TO YOU?

32:05.715 --> 32:06.841
DID YOU FIND
ANYTHING OUT?

32:06.883 --> 32:08.509
HIS MAIN
PSYCHIATRIST DID.

32:08.551 --> 32:09.677
WHAT'D HE SAY?

32:09.719 --> 32:11.679
WHAT TYPE MENTAL ILLNESS
DOES THIS GUY HAVE?

32:11.721 --> 32:14.015
HE'S SAYS HE'S
A SCHIZOPHRENIC

32:14.057 --> 32:15.516
CONTROLLED
BY MEDICATION.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.895
HE DIDN'T THINK
HE DID THE HOMICIDE.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.521
HE DIDN'T?

32:22.231 --> 32:24.692
AND DID THAT MAKE
SENSE TO YOU GUYS?

32:24.734 --> 32:25.985
NOTHING THEM PEOPLE SAY
MAKES SENSE.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.028
NO, HUH?

32:29.238 --> 32:31.199
HEY, TOMMY,
DID YOU, UH...

32:31.240 --> 32:32.575
TELL THIS DARLENE'S
BOYFRIEND

32:32.617 --> 32:34.118
THAT YOU WERE
HER BROTHER?

32:34.202 --> 32:36.663
DID I TALK
TO THE PSYCHO?

32:36.746 --> 32:39.582
NO. THE ACTOR BOYFRIEND.

32:39.666 --> 32:40.583
DID YOU TELL ANYBODY

32:40.667 --> 32:42.669
THAT YOU WERE
THE D.O.A.'S BROTHER?

32:42.752 --> 32:43.920
I THINK I TOLD
THE ACTOR FRIEND

32:44.003 --> 32:45.129
I WAS HER BROTHER.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.798
WHY?

32:46.881 --> 32:49.175
SO HE WOULDN'T THINK
I WAS COMING
FROM JEALOUSY

32:49.258 --> 32:50.593
OR THAT TYPE MOTIVE
LOOKING OUT
FOR DARLENE.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.095
HUH.

32:52.136 --> 32:53.805
THE ACTOR SAID

32:53.888 --> 32:56.265
I TOLD HIM
I WAS HER BROTHER?

32:56.349 --> 32:57.850
HE DID,
AND WE'RE GONNA GO UP,

32:57.934 --> 32:59.060
AND WE'RE GONNA ASK
THIS JASON ABOUT IT.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.436
DID YOU TELL HIM
THAT, TOO?

33:00.520 --> 33:02.438
I DON'T GET
THE IMPORTANCE.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.065
IT DON'T HAVE
TO BE IMPORTANT.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.108
THAT'S WHAT
I'M SAYING.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.442
JUST YOU TELLING A LIE.

33:06.484 --> 33:09.153
HEY. HOW ABOUT CHANGING
YOUR TONE OF VOICE?

33:09.237 --> 33:11.781
HEY, TOMMY. WHAT TIMES
DID YOU SEE THIS DARLENE?

33:11.823 --> 33:13.074
THE ONCE A WEEK OR SO

33:13.116 --> 33:14.575
THAT YOU TOLD US YOU WOULD
GET TOGETHER WITH HER.

33:14.617 --> 33:15.243
WHAT TIMES?

33:15.326 --> 33:16.577
WHAT...TIMES?

33:16.619 --> 33:17.578
HEY, SCREW YOU,
SIPOWICZ!

33:17.620 --> 33:18.997
BACK OFF, ANDY.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.082
I DON'T LIKE NOTHIN'
IMPEDES INVESTIGATIONS.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.625
SO IT'S AN INCONVENIENCE.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.800
I'D GO UP TO SEE HER
LATE, YOU KNOW.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.176
WELL, YOU DO MOSTLY
4:00-TO-12:00s.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.345
STOP IN AND SEE HER
AFTER THAT.

33:34.429 --> 33:35.847
NURSES AND COPS, HUH?

33:35.930 --> 33:36.973
EXACTLY. RIGHT.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.599
WE BOTH WORK
STRANGE SHIFTS.

33:38.641 --> 33:39.976
WHY WE ASK,

33:40.059 --> 33:41.978
NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS
SAID THEY'D SEE YOU.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.856
WELL, THAT'S WHY.
I'D STOP THERE
SO LATE.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.190
AS FAR AS SEEING
THE PSYCHO,

33:46.274 --> 33:47.483
I THINK I TOLD YOU
THAT I MET HIM
THE ONE TIME.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.610
DID YOU ASK HIM
HIS INTENTIONS
TOWARDS DARLENE?

33:49.652 --> 33:51.279
I DON'T KNOW IF I
ASKED HIM THAT

33:51.320 --> 33:53.865
OR WHAT SOLAR SYSTEM
HE CAME FROM.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.825
DID YOU ASK HIM
HIS INTENTIONS, TOMMY,

33:55.867 --> 33:57.452
SAYING YOU WERE
HER BROTHER?

34:00.788 --> 34:02.123
WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

34:02.165 --> 34:03.833
ARE YOU GUYS
LOOKING AT ME?

34:03.916 --> 34:05.209
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
YOUR CONNECTION TO HER.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.461
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE
LOOKING AT ME,

34:06.502 --> 34:07.462
THAT IS
COMPLETELY CRAZY.

34:07.503 --> 34:08.963
HER AND MY WIFE
WERE FRIENDS.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.465
WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH IT?

34:10.506 --> 34:12.508
WHAT WOULD THEIR
BEING FRIENDS PROVE
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER?

34:12.550 --> 34:14.302
SEE, YOU COULD ARGUE
THAT COULD BE THE REASON

34:14.343 --> 34:15.803
WHY YOU WOULD WANT
TO KILL HER, TOM.

34:15.845 --> 34:18.139
MAN, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.557
FOR THE SAKE
OF DISCUSSION,

34:19.640 --> 34:21.059
HER AND YOUR WIFE
ARE FRIENDS.

34:21.142 --> 34:22.518
YOU SEEING DARLENE
AT NIGHT,

34:22.602 --> 34:23.853
MAYBE IT'S GOTTEN
PHYSICAL.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.980
OR IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN PHYSICAL.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.190
NOT EVERYBODY
IN THE WORLD'S

34:27.231 --> 34:28.524
A SICK DRUNK
LIKE YOU, SIPOWICZ.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.193
FOR THE SAKE
OF DISCUSSION, TOMMY.

34:30.276 --> 34:31.652
YOU'RE POSSESSIVE
OVER DARLENE

34:31.694 --> 34:33.071
WITH OTHER GUYS THAT
SHE TRIES TO SEE,

34:33.154 --> 34:35.073
BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO BREAK IT OFF
WITH YOUR WIFE.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.283
MAYBE THIS DARLENE GIVES YOU
SOME TYPE ULTIMATUM--

34:37.325 --> 34:38.659
NO MORE
LATE-NIGHT RENDEZVOUS,

34:38.701 --> 34:41.329
PLUS SHE'S DROPPING A DIME
TO THE BETTER HALF.

34:41.370 --> 34:44.749
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS,
KISS MY ASS.

34:44.832 --> 34:46.042
DRAW STRAWS
FOR THE SEQUENCE?

34:46.084 --> 34:47.835
I MEAN IT.
I MEAN IT.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.213
THIS IS SICK,
AND I'M GETTING
THE HELL OUT.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.256
UNLESS YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA LOCK ME UP.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.258
NOBODY'S GONNA
LOCK YOU UP, TOMMY.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.677
WE'RE JUST GONNA
GO UPSTAIRS AND
TALK TO JASON.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.640
GOOD. YOU GO UP
AND TALK TO JASON.

35:00.723 --> 35:02.934
BIRDS OF A FEATHER.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.062
BIRDS OF A FEATHER?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.563
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,

35:07.605 --> 35:09.315
NOW I'M A SICK DRUNK
AND A PSYCHO?

35:20.409 --> 35:21.869
HOW'S IT GOING, JASON?

35:21.911 --> 35:24.372
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK.
WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

35:24.413 --> 35:27.041
YOU FEELING OK?

35:27.083 --> 35:30.086
I'M CONCERNED, WITH NOT
TAKING MY MEDICATION,

35:30.169 --> 35:33.089
THAT I MAY BE DELUSIONAL
AND PARANOID.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.632
YOUR DOCTOR OVER
AT THE HOSPITAL

35:34.715 --> 35:36.008
JUST TOLD US THAT
YOU'D BE ALL RIGHT

35:36.092 --> 35:37.593
NOT TAKING ANYTHING
FOR ABOUT A WEEK.

35:37.677 --> 35:40.096
WHAT IF I ALREADY
HAVEN'T BEEN TAKING IT?

35:40.179 --> 35:42.932
HE THINKS
YOU PROBABLY HAVE BEEN.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.100
HE DOES?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.351
MM-HMM.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.895
BASED ON WHEN HE'S
SEEN YOU OVER THERE...

35:47.937 --> 35:50.231
WHAT, WAS IT YESTERDAY?

35:50.273 --> 35:52.400
AND HOW WE
DESCRIBED YOU TO HIM.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.485
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
I'D BEEN TAKING IT, TOO.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.946
YOU'RE NOT HEARING ANY VOICES
OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

35:56.988 --> 35:58.489
I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE.

35:58.573 --> 35:59.991
OH, THAT'S GOOD,

36:00.074 --> 36:01.951
'CAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY
SPEAKING.

36:02.034 --> 36:04.954
IF I'VE BEEN TAKING
MY MEDICATION,

36:05.037 --> 36:06.455
WHY DID I KILL
DARLENE?

36:06.497 --> 36:07.790
JASON.

36:07.874 --> 36:08.916
JASON?

36:08.958 --> 36:11.752
DID YOU EVER MEET
DARLENE'S BROTHER?

36:11.794 --> 36:13.754
WE HAD ONE GOOD TALK.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.631
I THINK
I SATISFIED TOMMY

36:15.715 --> 36:17.592
MY INTENTIONS
WERE HONORABLE.

36:17.633 --> 36:20.970
DID YOU EVER
TALK TO TOMMY

36:21.012 --> 36:22.805
ABOUT YOUR
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS?

36:22.847 --> 36:26.017
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS RIGHT
TO WITHHOLD THAT.

36:26.100 --> 36:29.770
DID HE ASK YOU AT ALL
ABOUT TAKING YOUR MEDS?

36:29.812 --> 36:31.189
YES, TOMMY DID.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.524
I TOLD HIM I'D HAD
PERIODS IN THE PAST

36:33.608 --> 36:35.359
WHERE I'D HOLD THE MEDS
UNDER MY TONGUE,

36:35.443 --> 36:38.821
BUT THAT I'D BEEN
COMPLIANT FOR 7 MONTHS.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.866
WHICH AT THE TIME
I THOUGHT WAS TRUE.

36:41.949 --> 36:45.578
LOOK, NO BROTHER'S
GOING TO EMBRACE
HIS SISTER'S SUITOR

36:45.661 --> 36:47.538
WITH OPEN ARMS.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.832
AND GIVEN MY HISTORY
OF INSANITY,

36:49.916 --> 36:52.960
I FEEL TOMMY'S
REMINDING ME
OF MY NONCOMPLIANCE

36:53.002 --> 36:54.170
WAS APPROPRIATE.

36:54.253 --> 36:57.632
AND WHAT
I DID TO DARLENE
HAS BORNE THAT OUT.

36:57.673 --> 37:00.509
STOP SAYING YOU KILLED
THAT GIRL, ALL RIGHT?

37:00.593 --> 37:02.887
YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU KILLED HER.

37:02.970 --> 37:05.014
TOMMY MUST BE
FURIOUS WITH ME.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.373
Medavoy:
I'M GONNA MAKE
A GUESS NOW

37:30.414 --> 37:32.166
AS TO YOUR
POSSIBLE NAME.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.794
DON'T FORSAKE
YOUR SILENCE.

37:34.877 --> 37:37.129
JUST, MAYBE IF I'M
ON THE RIGHT TRACK,

37:37.213 --> 37:38.547
GIVE ME A NOD.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.060
I'M GETTING...
AN "A."

37:53.062 --> 37:54.021
"R."

37:56.065 --> 37:57.358
"T."

37:57.400 --> 37:59.902
I'M GETTING
AN "ARTURO."

37:59.986 --> 38:01.070
IS THAT
ANYWHERE CLOSE?

38:01.153 --> 38:02.238
IS YOUR FIRST NAME
ARTURO?

38:02.321 --> 38:04.448
WE KNOW A LOT MORE
ABOUT YOU

38:04.532 --> 38:06.742
THAN THE LAST TIME
WE SPOKE, ARTURO.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.202
I'M GETTING AN "R."

38:08.244 --> 38:10.079
"E."

38:10.162 --> 38:13.082
IS IT ARTURO REYNA,

38:13.124 --> 38:15.376
WITH 4 PRIOR
POSSESSION COLLARS
AND ONE FOR SALE?

38:15.459 --> 38:18.546
ARTURO, WE GOT NO INTENTION
OF PUTTING DRUGS

38:18.629 --> 38:21.090
INTO WHAT HAPPENED
ON THE STREET.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.092
AS FAR AS WE KNOW,
THIS WAS A SIMPLE ROBBERY,

38:23.175 --> 38:24.677
YOU GRABBING A BACKPACK.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.930
AND WHAT ABOUT
THAT GUY?

38:27.972 --> 38:30.391
LO, HE SPEAKS.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.559
WHICH GUY?

38:31.600 --> 38:33.102
THE GUY THAT GOT HURT.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.812
I HEARD THERE WAS
AN ALLEGED SHOOTING.

38:34.895 --> 38:37.440
AS FAR AS WE KNOW,
THAT GUY'S ALL RIGHT.

38:37.481 --> 38:40.151
SO I'D BE GOING
FOR GRABBING A BACKPACK?

38:40.234 --> 38:43.446
YEAH. IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD, IS IT?

38:43.529 --> 38:45.948
NAH, GUESS NOT.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.742
SHALL WE WRITE IT UP?

38:47.783 --> 38:49.410
YEAH.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.498
HOW'D YOU COME BY MY NAME?

38:55.916 --> 38:58.127
YOU DIDN'T GUESS IT,
RIGHT?

38:58.169 --> 39:00.629
DO NOT ASK ME TO PREDICT
LOTTO NUMBERS, ARTURO.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.924
MY POWERS
ARE USED SOLELY
TO ACCOMPLISH GOOD.

39:03.966 --> 39:06.594
ARE YOU SURE THE GUY
THAT GOT SHOT
IS ALL RIGHT?

39:06.635 --> 39:08.304
Kirkendall:
AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.314
LIEU.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.149
WE GOTTA LOOK HARDER
AT TOMMY RICHARDSON.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.360
THIS GUY UPSTAIRS
IS OUT OF HIS MIND,

39:22.443 --> 39:24.195
BUT HE DIDN'T
DO NO MURDER.

39:24.278 --> 39:26.280
DOESN'T MAKE IT
RICHARDSON.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.157
Sipowicz:
WE'RE NOT SAYING
IT'S DEFINITELY HIM.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.201
WHAT'S MAKING US
LOOK HARDER,

39:30.284 --> 39:32.244
A--EVERY GUYS THAT
SHOWS AN INTEREST
IN THIS GIRL,

39:32.328 --> 39:34.038
RICHARDSON GOES PAYING THEM
A SOCIAL CALL.

39:34.121 --> 39:35.456
SAYS HE'S HER BROTHER,

39:35.498 --> 39:37.124
WANTS TO KNOW
THEIR INTENTIONS.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.459
SO YOU THINK HE WAS
STILL INVOLVED
WITH HER HIMSELF?

39:38.501 --> 39:40.628
THIS GUYS HANGS OUT
WITH HER AT 1:00
IN THE MORNING.

39:40.669 --> 39:42.380
IT'S GUESSING PUTTING
AN EXACT MOTIVE ON HIM,

39:42.463 --> 39:45.174
IF THE D.O.A. IS LOOKING
TO BREAK IT OFF

39:45.257 --> 39:46.384
OR IF SHE'S THREATENING
TO TELL HIS WIFE.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.511
BUT WHY YOU WANT TO TRY
TO MAKE ONE FIT--

39:48.594 --> 39:51.138
RICHARDSON'S DEFINITELY
MOVING THIS NUT JOB'S
HEAD AROUND,

39:51.180 --> 39:52.723
PLANTING IN HIS MIND

39:52.807 --> 39:54.892
THAT HE MIGHT BE
OFF HIS MEDS.

39:54.975 --> 39:57.019
SETTING HIM UP
AS A SUSPECT.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.354
CUTS HER UP REAL GOOD,

39:58.437 --> 39:59.688
MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE A PSYCHO KILLER.

39:59.772 --> 40:00.815
MIKE SHANNON.

40:00.856 --> 40:03.025
MAYBE BEING
RICHARDSON'S DELEGATE.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.236
HOW'S IT GOING, MIKE?

40:05.319 --> 40:06.779
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

40:06.862 --> 40:08.239
I'M HERE AS
TOMMY RICHARDSON'S DELEGATE.

40:08.322 --> 40:10.366
IN OTHER WORDS,
RICHARDSON'S MAKING
THIS ADVERSARIAL.

40:10.449 --> 40:11.909
DON'T PISS IN MY EAR AND
TELL ME IT'S RAINING, ANDY.

40:11.992 --> 40:13.369
YOU'RE WHOSE MADE THIS
ADVERSARIAL.

40:13.452 --> 40:14.870
NO. WHAT'S MAKING IT
ADVERSARIAL, MIKE,

40:14.912 --> 40:17.039
IS TOMMY TELLING US LIES.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.165
TOMMY'S TOLD ME
YOU GOT A GUY IN CUSTODY

40:18.207 --> 40:19.500
CONFESSED TO THIS HOMICIDE.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.585
TO THE HOMICIDE PLUS
