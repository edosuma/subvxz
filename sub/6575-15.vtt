Whoa, sorry. That may have come off
a little too Wally.

RED INFERNO: Why?

16:40.765 --> 16:42.926
Once we believed we lived.

16:43.101 --> 16:46.935
Now there is only Red Inferno
and Red Torpedo.

16:47.105 --> 16:51.371
Why should we help save humanity,
when we are no longer human?

16:51.543 --> 16:53.602
RED TORNADO:
The premise of your question is flawed.

16:53.778 --> 16:55.143
You were never human.

Tornado, listen. We're on the verge
of a stage three super volcano eruption.

18:54.165 --> 18:57.328
There's no turning back from that.
We need to vent pressure fast...

RED TORNADO: Yes. I can speak again.

You were willing to sacrifice yourself
to save the planet.

The planet would have survived.

20:07.672 --> 20:10.266
It is humanity that was saved,
though not by me.

20:10.441 --> 20:13.740
My sister and brother
were the true heroes this day.

20:13.911 --> 20:17.972
My point is this, you were never the mole.
Never a traitor.

No. I left to protect you...

20:19.984 --> 20:24.648

I do not believe I should be repaired.

Why'd you volunteer to become
our den mother in the first place?

20:36.601 --> 20:39.866
RED TORNADO: I was the pragmatic choice.
I do not require sleep.

20:40.038 --> 20:42.939
I have no secret identity
or second life to live.

You wanted to become more human.

They're stiffs.

from Batman. Trust me.
