WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:05.130
.

00:05.171 --> 00:08.049
[refined music]

00:08.508 --> 00:12.721
* *

00:12.762 --> 00:15.265
- Mmm. Oh, that is good.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.350
- There is no coffee
like Gjelgjish coffee.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.852
- That's very true, Reid.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.186
Randall, slow down.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.354
You haven't had coffee
in a while, man.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.689
- [slurps]

00:22.731 --> 00:24.691
Mmm.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.861
Ahh. Daddy's home.
[chuckles]

00:27.902 --> 00:29.654
- The prime minister
is looking forward

00:29.696 --> 00:31.406
to tonight's welcome dinner.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.241
It's going to be
quite the event

00:33.283 --> 00:35.452
with some of Gjelgjiughm's
brightest luminaries

00:35.493 --> 00:36.536
in attendance.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.537
- Wow. It sounds amazing.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.789
- Ah, luminaries, huh?

00:39.831 --> 00:41.833
You know, I didn't pack
for an event like that.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.168
Uh, can I wear this?

00:45.253 --> 00:46.588
- Don't worry.
We'll put you in a corner seat.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.672
Nobody will notice.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.090
- [chuckles]

00:49.132 --> 00:52.552
[phone buzzes]

00:52.594 --> 00:54.721
- Prime Minister Honig
humbly requests your presence

00:54.763 --> 00:55.722
in her office.

00:55.764 --> 00:56.848
- Oh, OK. No problem.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.475
- Uh, just Mr. Johnson.

00:58.516 --> 01:01.770
Mr. Park, you can rest
in your suite until dinner.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.271
- What?

01:04.564 --> 01:05.607
- Thank you, Reid.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.444
Randall, listen.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.737
This could be a good thing.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.280
Maybe there's an opportunity

01:12.322 --> 01:14.240
where I could float
the coffee trade deal by her.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.784
- The prime minister hates me.
I knew it.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.744
- What are you talking about?
She doesn't hate you.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.371
- No, it's because
I celebrated too hard

01:19.412 --> 01:20.580
when I beat you at WrestleFest.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.540
Now she hates me
like she hates Taft.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.376
- OK, no more coffee for you
for the rest of the day.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.418
OK? Please.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.836
- [belches] I'm sorry.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.505
- You OK?
- Totally. Totally.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.298
OK, try to work
into the conversation

01:30.340 --> 01:32.926
that I'm a serious journalist
writing an in-depth article

01:32.967 --> 01:35.303
for, like, a "Vanity Fair"
type of publication,

01:35.345 --> 01:37.889
like a Tom Wolfe
or Hunter S. Thompson.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.848
- Here's what you should do.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.684
Have some cookies.

01:40.725 --> 01:41.851
Have a lot of cookies.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.269
You need to soak up
the caffeine.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.437
Look what's happening
right now.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.522
- What?

01:45.563 --> 01:46.731
- Just--
you're all over the place.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.566
- I'm fine.
- Just have some cookies.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.318
- Yeah, OK.
- I'll see you at dinner.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.156
- [muffled]
I'm having the best time.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.493
- Thank you.
Prime Minister.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.246
- [sighs] Dwayne, apologies.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.831
I know that you've just arrived

02:02.872 --> 02:05.542
and you probably want to rest
and freshen up before dinner.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.210
- No, not at all.
How can I help?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.295
- I would really appreciate
your opinion on something.

02:09.337 --> 02:10.547
- Mm-hmm.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.466
- What do you think
of this portrait?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.218
[soft music]

02:15.260 --> 02:17.470
- I think it's great.
You look like a true leader.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.264
Open to any possibility

02:19.305 --> 02:21.307
that might make
your country better,

02:21.349 --> 02:23.768
say, a potential trade deal
with another country--

02:23.810 --> 02:25.979
- I don't like it.
- Mm.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.814
What don't you like about it?

02:27.856 --> 02:29.649
- I don't know.

02:29.691 --> 02:33.570
I mean, honestly, I don't think
I like the whole idea of it.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.239
I was born and raised
right here in Gjelgjiughm.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.908
Last year at this time,
I was just a regular citizen,

02:38.950 --> 02:41.327
and now I--

02:41.369 --> 02:42.537
[sighs]

02:42.579 --> 02:43.913
- I get it.
- Mm.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.999
- The pressure of sudden fame
can be tough.

02:46.041 --> 02:49.544
Eyes on you all the time.
- Ugh, all the time.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.005
- Constantly.
- [sighs] My goodness.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.507
I mean, how did you deal
with it in the beginning?

02:54.549 --> 02:56.885
- Honestly, it was, uh--
it was tricky.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.846
I had just delivered
my first promo as a heel.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.892
I became the youngest
intercontinental champion

03:03.933 --> 03:06.019
in WWF history.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.729
And what did it get me?
[crowd booing]

03:07.771 --> 03:10.273
In arenas across the country,

03:10.315 --> 03:12.442
I heard chants
of "Rocky sucks."

03:12.484 --> 03:14.361
crowd: [chanting]
Rocky sucks! Rocky sucks!

03:14.402 --> 03:17.280
- Well, Rocky Maivia
is a lot of things,

03:17.322 --> 03:19.491
but "sucks" isn't one of them.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.284
I couldn't tell
if my heel turn

03:21.326 --> 03:22.535
joining
the Nation of Domination

03:22.577 --> 03:24.913
got over with the crowd.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.831
And backstage,
I couldn't tell

03:26.873 --> 03:28.375
if it got over
with the brass either.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.834
What'd you think?

03:29.876 --> 03:31.419
- What matters now is
what the folks at home think

03:31.461 --> 03:33.004
about the new Rocky Maivia.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.714
Eh, we'll find out soon enough.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.883
The next live show
is in five days.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.718
When you step out
into that crowd in Chicago,

03:38.760 --> 03:41.554
we'll know all we need to know
about whether you got over.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.473
- And that's how Pat left it.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.934
In five days, the fans
who saw my promo on TV

03:45.975 --> 03:47.394
are gonna come into that arena

03:47.435 --> 03:48.978
and let me know
how they feel about me.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.355
- And how do you
want them to feel?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.399
- As a heel,
I want them to hate me

03:52.440 --> 03:53.525
and love to hate me.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.734
- I'm gonna take
your word for it.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.444
[chuckles]

03:56.486 --> 03:58.363
- Excuse me, could we get
some more water, please?

04:00.281 --> 04:01.741
I'm sure she heard me.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.411
Anyway,
I'm glad I did what I did,

04:04.452 --> 04:07.414
but I've got no control
over how the fans will react.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.874
I put everything on the line
with that promo.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.502
Not just my career.
Our future, my family's future.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.629
- Don't put so much pressure
on yourself.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.673
Just take a moment to be proud

04:16.715 --> 04:19.342
about finally being
your true self out there.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.928
- Yeah, it did feel good.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.930
- Hi, can we get
a couple of those waters?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.473
- It's like
she sped up that time.

04:25.515 --> 04:26.725
- Yeah, like she didn't want
the water to melt.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.393
[both laugh]

04:28.435 --> 04:30.061
So five days until Chicago.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.813
- What's five days?
We do that every week.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.606
- Exactly. I mean,
a full week is seven days.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.858
So it's not even a week.
- Yeah, it's like

04:34.899 --> 04:36.109
if you met a friend for drinks
and they said,

04:36.151 --> 04:37.944
"Hey, let's do this again
in five days,"

04:37.986 --> 04:39.571
you'd say, "Whoa, slow down."

04:39.612 --> 04:40.655
- "We just saw each other."
[both laugh]

04:40.697 --> 04:41.823
- Sorry for the wait.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.409
Here's your side
of ranch dressing.

04:49.914 --> 04:50.081
.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.667
- I left that restaurant
feeling good

04:53.960 --> 04:54.002
and planned to get
a full night's sleep,

04:54.753 --> 04:55.086
but that didn't happen.

04:56.171 --> 04:56.921
I simply couldn't
stop thinking

04:58.089 --> 04:58.798
about how the fans
would react to me

04:59.716 --> 05:00.842
when I finally got to Chicago.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.635
- How do you want your eggs?

05:04.387 --> 05:05.889
Dwayne.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.557
Your eggs.
- Oh, yeah.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.641
Yeah, my legs are great.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.643
I imagined
every possible outcome

05:10.685 --> 05:12.729
over and over and over again.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.522
[knock at door]
- What's taking so long?

05:17.067 --> 05:18.610
- It's not what you think.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.528
Full disclosure--
it was at first,

05:20.570 --> 05:21.821
but not anymore.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.531
- I have to get ready for work.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.450
Do I have to use the bathroom
at the Chevron?

05:25.492 --> 05:26.993
- With my future on the line,

05:27.035 --> 05:29.412
these five days felt
like an eternity.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.416
- Hey.
- Dewey.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.626
I'm so glad you called.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.419
We came as fast as we could.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.088
- Oh, a little too fast.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.964
- Look.
I had the right of way.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.424
Pigeon wasn't fit for the city.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.886
How you doing, son?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.721
Waiting to see if you got over
with the fans can be tough.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.473
Believe me.
I've been there.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.892
- Yeah. Thanks, Dad.
- This apartment is spotless.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.937
- Yeah, I've been doing
some, uh, cleaning.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.772
- Well,
you only clean like this

05:55.814 --> 05:57.232
when there's something
really bothering you.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.566
- Hmm?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.151
- Are you getting enough sleep?

06:00.193 --> 06:02.237
Does Dany snore?

06:02.278 --> 06:03.780
Is her snoring
during this stressful time

06:03.822 --> 06:04.948
forcing you
from your marital bed?

06:04.989 --> 06:06.866
- Mom, no.
Nobody's snoring.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.827
And please don't say
"marital bed."

06:08.868 --> 06:10.078
- Hey, son.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.371
What's this mess over here?

06:11.413 --> 06:13.540
- I started doing puzzles
to help pass the time.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.459
- Not enough yarn in the world
to make me adopt a cat.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.544
- Anyway, how's things?

06:17.585 --> 06:18.753
How's Tampa?
- Good.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.005
Uh, we're excited about

06:20.046 --> 06:21.631
Rocky and Mom's wrestling gym
opening up.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.842
- Oh, yeah. The gym.
How's that going?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.011
- Couldn't be better.
- The gym is a mess.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.221
- Do you need me to clean it?
- No, son.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.973
Ooh, but I would love it

06:30.015 --> 06:31.808
if you came back
and signed some autographs

06:31.850 --> 06:33.184
for the grand opening
in a few weeks.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.728
- Absolutely, Dad.
- [laughs] Oh.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.855
- Whatever I can do to help.
- [chuckles] Great.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.107
The only thing more exciting
to potential gym members

06:39.149 --> 06:41.234
than talking to me
is talking to me

06:41.276 --> 06:43.903
and someone that's half me.
[laughter]

06:43.945 --> 06:45.530
- You don't even have
a wrestling ring.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.782
- Again, I'm not buying used.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.492
That's how you catch something.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.037
- I appreciated
my family visiting,

06:52.078 --> 06:54.831
but their energy wasn't
helping me pass the time.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.624
And so, I decided
to take a drive

06:56.666 --> 06:58.835
to visit an old friend.
[indistinct arguing]

06:59.669 --> 07:01.838
- Oh, man, sure is nice
to have you here, Dewey.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.256
- Hey.
- Hey, you need a fresh beer

07:03.298 --> 07:04.632
or a rubber nipple for that one
you've been nursing?

07:04.674 --> 07:05.759
[both laugh]

07:05.800 --> 07:07.302
- I'm OK, Bruno.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.138
I've got 23 hours
until my next match in Chicago,

07:10.180 --> 07:13.641
so I'm just happy
to be here by your...pool.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.018
- Oh, don't worry,
someone's on their way

07:16.519 --> 07:17.604
to collect that dead finch,
and then we'll go swimming.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.855
Hey, but come on, brother.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.565
No one brings up
the exact amount of hours

07:20.607 --> 07:22.150
before an event unless they're
worried about something.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.651
- I just thought
these five days

07:23.693 --> 07:24.986
leading up to my next match
would be easy.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.654
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.531
But I can't stop worrying
about what might happen there.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.699
- Yeah, I understand.

07:29.741 --> 07:30.909
Wondering
how the fans might react

07:30.950 --> 07:32.827
to something you say
or might do in the ring,

07:32.869 --> 07:34.579
seen it affect a lot of guys.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.998
- Look, I know uncertainty
is part of the deal, right?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.334
But getting on the mic
like that,

07:39.376 --> 07:41.169
saying exactly
what I wanted to say...

07:41.211 --> 07:43.088
- Mm-hmm.
- It felt great.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.340
So if I don't get over...
- Yeah, you'll be crushed.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.800
- Yeah,
because it wouldn't just mean

07:46.841 --> 07:49.010
I would probably
lose my job in the WWF.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.179
But I'll be losing a feeling

07:51.221 --> 07:53.556
that I can't replicate
anywhere else,

07:53.598 --> 07:55.600
doing anything else.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.726
- I get it, brother.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.144
Nothing else like it
in the world.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.731
Hey. Have no fear, all right?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.274
It's gonna happen for you.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.193
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna get you a fresh one.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.779
Any time you drink a warm beer,
an angel loses its wings.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.031
Not on my watch.
[both laugh]

08:12.075 --> 08:14.703
- And then finally,
those five days were over,

08:14.744 --> 08:15.829
and I was in Chicago,

08:15.870 --> 08:17.288
not knowing
what was gonna happen.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.749
- This is it, Dewey.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.002
Let's find out
if anybody's talking about you.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.336
- Yeah.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.130
- Any thoughts
before we get started, Vince?

08:25.171 --> 08:28.216
- First match can make
the night or break the night.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.135
Let's see it.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.137
- You heard the man!

08:32.178 --> 08:35.849
[distant cheering]

08:35.890 --> 08:38.018
- You ready?
- [sighs] Yeah.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.645
It's all or nothing now.
- Damn right.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.023
Come on.
Come on.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.733
It's party time!

08:44.774 --> 08:48.153
all: * We are
the Nation of Domination! *

08:48.194 --> 08:50.030
- Being booed
as a heel faction was normal

08:50.071 --> 08:52.032
and to be expected,

08:52.073 --> 08:54.242
but nobody expected
what happened next.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.369
crowd: [chanting]
Rocky sucks! Rocky sucks!

08:56.411 --> 08:58.747
[crowd booing, jeering]

08:58.788 --> 09:02.250
- You could feel they were
actually enjoying hating me.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.753
- Congrats, son.
They can't stand your ass.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.838
- Which is exactly
what I wanted.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.923
I had gotten over as a heel.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.009
They remembered my speech
five days ago,

09:11.051 --> 09:13.762
and they loved
hating me for it.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.096
And I couldn't
have been happier.

09:19.768 --> 09:19.976
.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.686
- Minding those fists again.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.355
- After the fans' response

09:24.773 --> 09:25.357
that night in Chicago,
there was no looking back.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.819
I was a house of fire,

09:29.861 --> 09:32.489
and the fan reaction
was instant and intense.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.240
It was at a whole other level.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.701
- You suck, Rocky!

09:36.743 --> 09:38.703
Also, I love you!

09:38.745 --> 09:41.414
- You know, ever since
I got to Minnesota,

09:41.456 --> 09:45.293
people keep telling me this is
the Land of 10,000 Lakes.

09:45.335 --> 09:49.381
But when I look around,
all I see are 10,000 jabronis.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.091
- Welp, just saying,
what's not to like?

09:51.132 --> 09:53.718
[crowd booing]
- Listen to this crowd.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.847
- But you've gotta commend
the athletic ability.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.016
[rock music]

10:00.058 --> 10:01.351
- Getting back
on the offensive.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.936
- Look at this!
- Great offense!

10:02.977 --> 10:04.896
- Good night, nurse!
Whoo-hoo!

10:04.938 --> 10:06.523
- Tremendous DDT.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.316
- [laughs]

10:10.026 --> 10:12.362
- Oh, attaboy, son!
- That's it, Dewey!

10:12.404 --> 10:16.324
- Snap his neck
like a Thanksgiving turkey!

10:16.366 --> 10:19.911
- So I hear
you're the number one wrestler

10:19.953 --> 10:21.538
in all of Milwaukee.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.873
[cheers and applause]

10:23.915 --> 10:25.500
Your daddy's here.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.918
Your grandmama's here.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.336
Hell, even the girl

10:28.378 --> 10:31.381
that you finally got the guts
to ask out is here.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.258
What's up, girl?
[crowd booing]

10:33.299 --> 10:37.387
But what you, them,
and everybody here needs to do

10:37.429 --> 10:38.763
is two things--

10:38.805 --> 10:40.432
know your role

10:40.473 --> 10:42.934
and shut your mouth!

10:42.976 --> 10:46.354
[crowd booing, jeering]

10:46.396 --> 10:48.481
- Watch out now.
- Ready to do a Rock Bottom.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.233
He's setting him up.
- Rock Bottom.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.360
- Made it!
Who's your daddy?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.237
- * Whoa, whoa *

10:54.279 --> 10:55.572
- Let's switch up
next week's main event

10:55.613 --> 10:57.198
and get Dwayne in there.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.409
- You got it, Vince.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.953
- Oh, what a shot to the face.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.456
Ken Shamrock
with a thunderous clothesline.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.082
- Ken Shamrock.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.417
- Show these people
you don't suck!

11:07.459 --> 11:09.294
- Vince knew I was
one of the hottest tickets

11:09.336 --> 11:11.421
in the WWF.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.922
He never told me that
directly,

11:12.964 --> 11:15.592
but he didn't have to.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.469
I knew
'cause he started booking me

11:17.510 --> 11:18.928
at the top of the card
facing stars

11:18.970 --> 11:20.180
like Ken Shamrock.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.931
[crowd booing]

11:21.973 --> 11:24.059
- * Rock now,
rock the night *

11:24.100 --> 11:27.228
* *

11:27.270 --> 11:29.606
[crowd booing, jeering]

11:29.647 --> 11:32.108
- Hold on.
I want to try something.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.818
- Hey, look at this!
- Wait a minute.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.445
Setting him up.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.447
- Oh, he may have
to get some steam here.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.450
[dramatic music]

11:40.492 --> 11:43.119
* *

11:43.161 --> 11:44.537
And here it comes.
- Yes!

11:44.579 --> 11:47.624
- The elbow to the left
of the heart of Shamrock.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.417
Come on now.
With a hook to the leg.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.169
- Shamrock felt that.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.587
- Dropping it on Shamrock.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.963
[crowd cheering, booing]

11:54.005 --> 11:55.382
- The People's Elbow?

11:55.423 --> 11:56.466
I don't get it, man.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.134
You hit the ropes twice.

11:58.176 --> 12:01.346
You jump over me for no reason
and drop an elbow.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.931
- It got a pop, didn't it?
- [scoffs]

12:02.972 --> 12:04.557
The most ridiculous thing
I ever seen.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.309
[rock music]

12:06.351 --> 12:08.395
- Oh, I'm just getting started.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.980
- Uh-oh. Here it comes!
Oh!

12:11.022 --> 12:13.400
- And drives the elbow.
- Oh!

12:13.441 --> 12:14.943
- Now he wants that
referred to

12:14.984 --> 12:16.403
as The People's Elbow.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.197
- Yeah! The People's Elbow
into the sternum.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.368
Watch this.
This is pretty cool.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.661
- Do it, Rocky!
Come on!

12:24.703 --> 12:26.454
- Put the brakes on. Bang!

12:27.622 --> 12:29.082
- I was now operating

12:29.124 --> 12:31.251
from a place
of extreme confidence,

12:31.292 --> 12:33.586
and it was paying off
in spades.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.673
[crowd booing, jeering]

12:36.715 --> 12:37.799
- * East, west *

12:37.841 --> 12:39.676
- After that amazing run
on the road,

12:39.718 --> 12:42.095
I couldn't wait
to see my family in Tampa

12:42.137 --> 12:43.930
and help my dad
open his new gym,

12:43.972 --> 12:46.016
just like I said I would.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.601
But excited as I was
to sign some autographs,

12:48.643 --> 12:50.562
I wasn't prepared
for what I was about to see.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.522
Holy...

12:52.564 --> 12:53.898
- There he is!
There he is!

12:53.940 --> 12:57.235
[crowd cheering]

12:57.277 --> 12:59.529
- * Lyrical acrobatics
needs something *

12:59.571 --> 13:01.614
* To rock the mic
and get the crowd jumping *

13:01.656 --> 13:03.074
[all cheering]
- Thank you.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.410
Thank you so much.
[sighs]

13:05.452 --> 13:07.579
I can't believe
how many people are here.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.122
- They're all just
finally seeing in you

13:09.164 --> 13:10.123
what we've known for years.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.207
- She's right, Dewey.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.709
We always knew.

13:12.751 --> 13:15.337
Isn't that right, High Chief?

13:15.378 --> 13:17.172
High Chief said that's right.
[laughter]

13:17.213 --> 13:18.631
- Welcome to life on top, son.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.383
- It's so surreal.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.052
- I've been there,
and let me tell you:

13:22.093 --> 13:24.095
when that spotlight is
shining down, you gotta--

13:24.137 --> 13:26.097
- I know, I know.
Keep your feet on the ground.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.265
- Hell no!

13:27.307 --> 13:29.517
Moonwalk on a 747, son.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.394
You're the king!
[chuckles]

13:31.436 --> 13:33.146
Oh, OK. Hey.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.440
Thank you all so much
for coming out.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.026
And don't forget,
as you get your autograph,

13:38.068 --> 13:41.571
we have founding memberships
available for 30 bucks a month.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.407
- 35 a month
if you want towel service.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.201
- That's a great value.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.621
Plus, the towels got
the gym logo on 'em.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.625
I mean, the towels are
a beautiful classic white.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.087
- We love you, Rocky.
- Oh.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.755
Thank you, man.
- Thanks, friend.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.257
We gotta figure out a way
to sort out this name confusion

14:01.299 --> 14:02.425
while we're together in public.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.010
- Well, he was
clearly talking to me.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.011
- Eh, that's up for debate.

14:05.053 --> 14:05.970
- I was talking to him.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.138
- Hey, long line.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.015
Let's keep it moving, huh?

14:09.057 --> 14:11.559
- I signed autographs
for about eight hours.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.144
I think I strained my forearm.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.021
- Well, as your true friend
and pretend doctor,

14:15.063 --> 14:16.439
I'm prescribing you
a dozen beers for the pain.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.108
[laughs]

14:18.149 --> 14:20.485
Dewey, for real, though,
I'm proud of you.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.070
I always knew
you had it in you.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.406
- Bruno, I wouldn't be here
without you.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.740
- Oh.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.575
- So glad we could
finally catch a game.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.702
- Me too. Can you answer me
this question, though?

14:28.743 --> 14:30.161
Why aren't they
throwing it more?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.996
- Man, you can't throw
against Deion Sanders.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.040
- Maivia, arm wrestle you
for a beer.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.000
- Right now?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.754
- [exhales sharply]

14:39.796 --> 14:41.172
- Don't worry
about the beer, buddy.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.299
OK. What down is it?

14:43.341 --> 14:44.718
- Hi.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.012
Rocky?
- Yeah.

14:47.053 --> 14:50.640
- Remember when you
body-slammed the Undertaker,

14:50.682 --> 14:52.642
and he tried to get up,

14:52.684 --> 14:55.145
and you were like,
"No way, buster!"

14:55.186 --> 14:57.230
And then you punched him, and
you gave him the Rock Bottom.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.691
And then the ref was like,
"One, two, three"?

14:59.733 --> 15:01.317
- Yeah, I do.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.819
- It was a great match.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.196
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- [chuckles]

15:05.238 --> 15:06.573
- OK. Who's got the ball?

15:06.614 --> 15:09.034
- [laughs]
Game's over, brother.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.076
- Over?
- Yeah.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.327
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- Nope.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.204
Deion picked six
to win the game.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.789
Oh, look.
Talking about it right now.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.542
- Listen, you're gonna throw
against Deion in prime time,

15:18.710 --> 15:20.378
you're gonna pay,
'cause Deion is prime time.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.088
- Tell you what,
you gotta have major swagger

15:22.130 --> 15:23.381
to talk like that
in third person.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.466
- Hell yeah, you do.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.593
I like it.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.261
- Hey, bro, when the hell

15:28.303 --> 15:29.596
are you gonna
wrestle Steve Austin?

15:29.637 --> 15:31.681
- Um, I don't know,

15:31.723 --> 15:33.600
but I'll tell Vince
the fans want to see it.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.060
- Hell yeah, bro. Hey.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.394
Shotgun a beer
with me real quick.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.771
- I'm sorry.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.315
I'm just taking it easy
watching some games.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.608
- Hey.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.152
Who wants to bet
that I can shotgun a beer

15:44.194 --> 15:46.363
faster than Rocky Maivia?

15:46.404 --> 15:47.781
[all cheering]
Come on!

15:47.822 --> 15:50.450
- I wasn't prepared
for living in the spotlight

15:57.582 --> 15:57.791
.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.542
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.421
- Someone's hungry.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.756
- Cod might be
the perfect fish.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.132
- [chuckles]

16:06.174 --> 16:07.342
- Let me top you off,
Mr. Maivia.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.511
- Whoa, you're like
a water ninja today.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.304
- I did win

16:11.346 --> 16:13.848
two nonconsecutive
Halloween costume contests

16:13.890 --> 16:16.351
when I dressed up as a ninja
in college.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.395
- Congrats on that.
- Nonconsecutive?

16:18.436 --> 16:21.189
- Sophomore year, I had mono.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.692
Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.235
- She sure is more attentive

16:25.276 --> 16:26.319
than the last time
we were here.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.612
- Yeah. No kidding.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.863
- Think of all that's happened
since then.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.490
- It's been insane.
[sighs]

16:30.532 --> 16:32.117
But you know what?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.244
It feels like we've only
been talking about me lately.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.329
How are you doing?
How's work been?

16:36.371 --> 16:37.706
- Oh, great.
Actually, I just got this--

16:37.747 --> 16:40.375
- Excuse us.
Rocky Maivia?

16:40.417 --> 16:42.585
I don't mean to bother you,
but can we get your autograph?

16:42.627 --> 16:45.213
- [sighs]

16:45.255 --> 16:46.256
Sure.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.133
- Oh, my God. Sorry.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.385
I told you we shouldn't have.
- No, no, no. It's OK.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.141
- Thanks so much.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.476
Enjoy your dinner.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.354
- What was that about?
- I know.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.398
I'm sorry they interrupted you.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.691
It's been happening
all the time now

17:04.733 --> 17:05.817
when I'm in public.
- Dwayne.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.610
I wasn't talking about them.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.571
I was talking about you.
- What did I do?

17:09.612 --> 17:11.156
- You were so rude to them.
- Rude?

17:11.197 --> 17:12.615
I gave him my autograph.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.409
- You really didn't see
what you did?

17:14.451 --> 17:17.203
- I truly have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:17.245 --> 17:18.413
- All right.
Let's do an exercise.

17:18.455 --> 17:19.789
- Oh.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.875
- Not that kind of exercise.
It's one I learned

17:21.916 --> 17:23.376
at a Merrill Lynch
team-building lunch.

17:23.418 --> 17:24.586
- Oh.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.421
- We're gonna pretend
to be that couple

17:26.463 --> 17:28.298
right before they came over
and interrupted our dinner.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.675
- All right. Let's do it.
- All right.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.927
Oh, my God.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.221
Look, it's Rocky Maivia.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.431
- That's my favorite wrestler.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.807
- [chuckles]
- I gotta go over there.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.517
- No, no, no, no.
You can't bother him.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.437
He's with his beautiful wife.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.772
She's got great hair,
by the way.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.775
- Awesome hair,
but he's my guy.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.610
I may never see him again.
- You're right.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.195
You're right.
You have to do it.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.780
- OK, but you gotta
come with me.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.156
It'll be awesome.
- Let's go.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.784
- [clears throat]
Excuse me, Mr. Maivia?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.410
Can we get your autograph?

17:58.953 --> 18:00.663
- [sighs]

18:00.705 --> 18:02.582
Sure.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.459
- I did not do it like that.
- Yes, you did.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.794
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.295
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.672
- Did I?
- Yes!

18:10.423 --> 18:13.259
- [sighs] Man, I'm the worst.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.844
- You're certainly
not the worst,

18:14.886 --> 18:17.222
but in that moment,
maybe you weren't your best.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.557
- It's just everything
that's happened since Chicago

18:19.599 --> 18:20.934
has been amazing.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.936
It's what I've always wanted.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.979
- And it's everything
I wanted for you.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.483
- But things are different.
- I know.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.652
You've lost your ability
to be anonymous in public,

18:30.694 --> 18:32.237
and that's hard.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.322
But you've gained something
way more important--

18:34.364 --> 18:35.699
the ability
to make people happy,

18:35.740 --> 18:37.951
and you love
to make people happy.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.745
Just remember
that's why you're doing this.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.210
- Excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

18:47.252 --> 18:48.628
- Oh, my gosh.

18:48.670 --> 18:49.796
Would you like to sit down?

18:49.838 --> 18:51.423
- Yeah.
Can we get you anything?

18:51.464 --> 18:52.716
What are we doing?
- Do you want my chair?

18:52.757 --> 18:53.842
- This is not--yeah, get up.
- OK. I'll get up.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.468
- No, no, no. It's OK.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.804
I just wanted to apologize
for being so rude earlier.

18:57.846 --> 19:00.640
I really appreciate you both
stopping by and saying hello.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.684
- Don't worry about it.
It's totally cool.

19:02.726 --> 19:06.021
- It wasn't cool, which is why
I picked up your dinner tab

19:06.062 --> 19:08.356
and have a round of Fernets
coming to your table.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.401
- I don't know what that is,
but thank you so much.

19:11.443 --> 19:14.612
- Yeah, I gotta say,
you are much nicer in person

19:14.654 --> 19:16.322
than the guy you play
in the ring.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.575
Even though we love him too.
[chuckles]

19:18.616 --> 19:21.828
- Now you can tell your friends
you went one-on-one

19:21.870 --> 19:24.039
with the jabroni-beating,
pie-eating,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.541
trailblazing,
eyebrow-raising,

19:26.583 --> 19:28.335
heart-stopping,
elbow-dropping...

19:28.376 --> 19:29.961
Tip your waitress.
Raise your glass.

19:30.003 --> 19:34.382
If you approach me again,
I'll whup your candy ass!

19:34.424 --> 19:36.634
[both laugh]

19:36.676 --> 19:38.553
- I got The People's Elbow!
- Come on!

19:40.263 --> 19:41.723
[indistinct chatter]

19:45.393 --> 19:46.436
[sighs]

19:46.478 --> 19:48.396
- That seemed to go well.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.648
- I'm glad I did that.
- [chuckles]

19:50.690 --> 19:53.360
- Thank you.

19:53.401 --> 19:54.569
- I hope you saved room
for dessert,

19:54.611 --> 19:55.987
'cause the waitress came by
and said

19:56.029 --> 19:57.572
she's sending a pie
on the house.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.950
She said you love pie,
which I don't think is true.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.619
- My persona loves pie.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.662
- Why?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.664
- It's a metaphor.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
Let's not worry about that now.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.335
You know, after that moment
with those fans

20:10.377 --> 20:12.754
at the restaurant,
I never looked at any aspect

20:12.796 --> 20:14.756
of my fame as bad ever again.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.007
- Mm.
- I mean, I was given

20:16.049 --> 20:17.592
this amazing opportunity

20:17.634 --> 20:20.970
to fulfill my dreams
and make a difference.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.306
I'll always be
very grateful for that,

20:23.348 --> 20:25.684
even when fame can sometimes be
a little uncomfortable.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.644
And I know you can relate.
- I can.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.104
[chuckles]
- Yeah.

20:29.145 --> 20:32.774
- I still think
I should have smiled.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.944
- I really like it like that.
Keep 'em guessing.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.487
No one will ever know
what's under there.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.948
- Maybe knives.
- Yes, knives.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.783
- [laughs]
- A mouthful of knives...

20:41.825 --> 20:43.076
- [growls]
- For the critics.

20:43.118 --> 20:45.078
- [chuckles]
- So, uh, what do you think?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.663
Brought it in case
we went kayaking.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.456
[chuckles]

20:48.498 --> 20:51.334
- We can seat you in a corner.
No one will notice.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.003
- Yeah, and I can't wait
to go hiking in Joshua Tree.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.716
Randall, your socks,
you gotta pull them up.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.969
- Dwayne, I am just dying
to know more.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.013
I mean, what happened
after that dinner with Dany?

21:03.054 --> 21:05.473
- Well, when I went
back out on the road,

21:05.515 --> 21:07.392
Dany was right
about me being myself

21:07.434 --> 21:09.811
inside and outside the ring.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.564
But I realized if I really
wanted to be myself,

21:12.605 --> 21:13.898
I'd have to address
the name issue

21:13.940 --> 21:16.484
that my dad brought up to me
back at his gym.

21:16.526 --> 21:17.610
[rock music]

21:17.652 --> 21:20.780
It was time
to retire Rocky Maivia.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.991
Well, Fayetteville,

21:23.033 --> 21:26.494
let's see whose ass
is about to get whupped,
