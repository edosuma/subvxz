WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.136
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
The killer you pointed me to
is still out there.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.672
What is it?
Three hearts, three murders.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.007
The rest of the jars
are empty.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.208
I'd say he's far from done.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.143
Mary, Queen of Scots,
will soon seek

00:11.145 --> 00:12.745
a marriage alliance.
And a new alliance

00:12.747 --> 00:15.414
would raise her
international standing.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.683
And how do you suggest
I gain Mary's trust?

00:17.685 --> 00:19.685
Make Mary fall in love with you.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.355
Lord Narcisse gets to share his
bed with a pretty young thing

00:23.357 --> 00:25.290
while I'm expected
to retire alone.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.558
<i> But we can fix that, can't we?</i>

00:26.560 --> 00:29.294
Bring me back to life.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.230
There are suitors eager
to court you.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.198
You need funds
to protect Scotland.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.734
I'm just not ready
to marry another man.
You have to be.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.770
Don't go back to Scotland.
Court Don Carlos.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.505
Show Spain that you will
always have power

00:39.507 --> 00:41.373
as long as you are aligned
with France.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.775
Find my favorite portrait.

00:42.777 --> 00:45.210
<i> Send it to Don Carlos</i>
<i> with a message.</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:46.378
I'm ready.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.715
(birds chirping)

00:49.717 --> 00:52.484
Oh, no, Don
Carlos, you didn't.

00:52.486 --> 00:55.621
What choice did I have?
I had to know if this queen

00:55.623 --> 00:59.358
I was courting for Spain
was actually a man.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.226
I shouldn't be
listening to this.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.163
Elizabeth is my cousin
and a fellow queen.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.765
Nonsense. You love it.

01:06.767 --> 01:10.302
You feel the French nobles
judging you?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.204
I can't blame them.

01:12.206 --> 01:15.541
I hardly seem to be mourning
my husband, their king.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.077
You loved Francis.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.846
I've known you for days,
and nothing is clearer.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.848
But Scotland can't wait for you
to mourn.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.384
It needs the help of a country
like mine.

01:25.386 --> 01:28.720
Especially now, after France
is withdrawing her troops.

01:28.722 --> 01:32.191
Mary, you're simply doing
your duty as queen.

01:32.193 --> 01:35.127
You have made my duty
far more pleasant

01:35.129 --> 01:37.329
than it could have been.
I feel the same.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.598
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
Especially after a week

01:39.600 --> 01:42.601
with the crushingly boring
Archduchess Anna in Austria.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.471
(laughing)
I finally had
to flee.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.639
Who cares what they
think? And, anyway,

01:47.641 --> 01:50.342
I think I may know
a simple solution.
What?

01:50.344 --> 01:53.412
There's a game I enjoy,
sort of a theme for a party.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.481
What is this game called?
The Hound

01:55.483 --> 01:57.483
and the Hare. The hares race off

01:57.485 --> 01:59.384
into the woods,
and the hounds chase

01:59.386 --> 02:02.821
after them, hoping to catch
a hare and steal a kiss.

02:02.823 --> 02:07.292
It's harmless fun, but
I find it reveals things.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.863
A player's determination,
their sense of adventure.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.134
That sounds very enjoyable,
but...

02:15.136 --> 02:17.503
I'm afraid
I must decline.
It's quite fun.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.804
I'm sorry. It doesn't sound
like the game for me.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.572
But that
doesn't mean

02:20.574 --> 02:23.142
we can't further enjoy
each other's company.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.643
Would you like to have tea
with me

02:24.645 --> 02:27.412
in a few hours?
It would be my pleasure.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.681
(horse neighs)

02:29.683 --> 02:32.251
(indistinct chatter)

02:35.523 --> 02:37.523
What a pleasure to speak
with you today.

02:37.525 --> 02:41.560
And with you. Majesties.

02:41.562 --> 02:44.730
I'm glad to see you getting
along so well with Lord Bertram.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.566
Maybe now you finally have
the support in the privy council

02:47.568 --> 02:50.702
to win the vote.
The matter's
not quite settled yet.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.271
But I'm close.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.339
Thanks to your sacrifice.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.176
Renouncing French military
support in Scotland and giving

02:57.178 --> 02:59.811
me a political victory,
I won't forget it.

02:59.813 --> 03:04.316
As long as I am in power,
you will have an ally in France.

03:04.318 --> 03:07.853
Not that you'll need it
if you wed Spain's prince.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.722
How goes it with Don Carlos?

03:10.724 --> 03:14.660
He is a kind man. Amusing.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.795
A trifle eccentric, perhaps.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.798
Ah. And not Francis.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.800
Don't feel guilty.

03:21.802 --> 03:25.404
Francis knew finding
another alliance for Scotland

03:25.406 --> 03:27.606
was your first task
as soon as he died.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.608
Did he not
insist on it?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.211
Your Majesty.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.684
It's from my brother James.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.820
News of Elizabeth's response
to French troops

03:41.822 --> 03:43.322
being withdrawn from Scotland.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.324
She has withdrawn
her troops as well.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.992
A moment of peace in Scotland.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.261
Let's hope it lasts.
It won't.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.697
Her troops are still massed
on their side of the border.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.899
A deliberate
lingering threat after all

03:53.901 --> 03:55.667
that I have given to gain peace.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.236
All the more reason
for you to strengthen

03:57.238 --> 03:59.705
yourself with a
marriage to Spain.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.243
(indistinct chatter)

04:04.245 --> 04:06.245
CATHERINE:
Gentlemen.
What a pleasure

04:06.247 --> 04:08.780
to see my son's privy council
so hard at work.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.783
King Charles was wondering
when you plan to vote

04:11.785 --> 04:13.252
on my confirmation as regent.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.587
We are still debating.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.523
We will vote
once the council is ready.

04:18.525 --> 04:21.026
(murmurs of assent)
France needs a leader now.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.528
We have soldiers
returning from war

04:23.530 --> 04:26.665
in Scotland. They need to
be paid and reposted.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.601
The prince of Spain and his
delegation is watching us to see

04:29.603 --> 04:32.771
if we've lost our direction
after we have lost our king.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.673
If you can't even
decide on a leader...

04:34.675 --> 04:36.742
There are already
several motions as to the timing

04:36.744 --> 04:38.043
of the vote.
Motions

04:38.045 --> 04:39.511
on timing? What,

04:39.513 --> 04:40.679
you can't even vote
on when to take

04:40.681 --> 04:41.747
a vote?

04:46.420 --> 04:50.522
I support your process
in these complex times.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.923
I'll simply
remind you

04:51.925 --> 04:55.027
that with me as regent

04:55.029 --> 04:57.696
you not only get a woman
who stood at the side

04:57.698 --> 05:00.365
of the last two great kings,

05:00.367 --> 05:01.633
you have a woman.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.635
Who, with her
female frailties,

05:03.637 --> 05:05.837
makes an
excellent scapegoat

05:05.839 --> 05:07.739
whenever chance turns events
against us.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.775
(murmuring)
It's true.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.711
You have ample experience,
Your Grace.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.780
All those in favor

05:14.782 --> 05:16.048
of holding
a vote

05:16.050 --> 05:18.050
to confirm the queen mother
as regent

05:18.052 --> 05:19.951
at midday tomorrow?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.822
(murmurs of assent)

05:26.460 --> 05:29.594
(chuckles)
I thank you, gentlemen.

05:29.596 --> 05:32.664
If you should have
any additional questions, I am

05:32.666 --> 05:34.566
at your disposal.

05:41.608 --> 05:42.908
Looking for me?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.643
(chuckles)
I knew you would.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.645
Well, you practically
invited me to follow you.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.647
Because I thought
you might be ready to negotiate.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.650
Negotiate what?
The terms in exchange
for your council vote.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.486
You're still very popular
with the nobles,

05:54.488 --> 05:57.656
and they assume that you
despise me. That makes

05:57.658 --> 05:59.658
your vote worth two
of anyone else's.

05:59.660 --> 06:03.762
Even though we know the acrimony
between us is now in our past.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.030
Our last encounter
was a mistake.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.565
A mistake we both
quite enjoyed.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.667
You enjoyed that?
Our affair...

06:08.669 --> 06:11.470
It isn't
an affair.
It's neither here nor there.

06:11.472 --> 06:15.140
In exchange for your vote, you
could be my lord chancellor.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.809
The second highest position
in France?

06:17.811 --> 06:19.511
Why would you?
The question is,
why wouldn't you?

06:19.513 --> 06:23.849
Unless you fear working closely
with me.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.502
Christophe.

06:45.539 --> 06:49.408
You saw me have my conversation
with Lord Narcisse, didn't you?

06:49.410 --> 06:51.676
I'm curious. Is your affair
about pleasure

06:51.678 --> 06:53.612
with him,
as it is with me?

06:53.614 --> 06:55.680
Or do you seek something
from him?

06:55.682 --> 06:57.115
Come here.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.117
I need his vote
to gain control,

06:59.119 --> 07:00.585
which I need to
protect my family.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.955
But for him to
give me this power,

07:03.957 --> 07:07.492
he needs to think
that he has power over me.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.862
And he does.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.635
Because he
bedded you.

07:24.945 --> 07:29.448
It's amazing how you take me
without any care for my station.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.683
No one can know
about our affair.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.218
Especially now.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.621
(moans)
(panting)

07:36.623 --> 07:38.824
I stack firewood.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.092
My head isn't made of it.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.562
Are you
England's new ambassador?

07:43.564 --> 07:46.965
I am, Your Majesty. Gideon
Blackburn, at your service.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.900
Hardly. You or Elizabeth.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.169
How can England even
pretend to want peace

07:51.171 --> 07:53.872
when her every move is to
bully and crush opposition?

07:53.874 --> 07:55.640
And how can our two
countries practice diplomacy

07:55.642 --> 07:57.642
when England replaces
ambassadors

07:57.644 --> 07:58.877
without even telling me?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.645
Did you get all that,
Jeffrey?

08:01.815 --> 08:02.914
What is he doing?

08:02.916 --> 08:04.716
Transcribing every word we say.

08:04.718 --> 08:05.917
Following his orders.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.986
As am I.
And what orders might those be?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.889
Well, frankly, not to botch
the job like my predecessor,

08:10.891 --> 08:12.224
Nicholas, did
and let you tear up a treaty

08:12.226 --> 08:13.892
that was signed
without witnesses.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.895
There will be
no more such oversights.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.263
My God,

08:18.265 --> 08:20.966
you are quite beautiful.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.634
Between you
and Elizabeth,

08:22.636 --> 08:24.069
I don't know
who is the more stunning.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.871
And will that be going
in Elizabeth's

08:25.873 --> 08:26.872
transcript?

08:27.708 --> 08:28.740
It will not.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.109
Let me be clear.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.713
Your queen is keeping her troops
on my border

08:34.715 --> 08:37.148
to threaten invasion,
and she will regret it.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.751
Every rival of England's will
want Scotland as an ally,

08:39.753 --> 08:42.254
and you will have made
two enemies, instead of one.

08:42.256 --> 08:43.989
And by all
means,

08:43.991 --> 08:45.557
quote me on that.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.029
She's just told us
she means to marry Don Carlos.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.598
We can't let that happen.
How can we stop it?

08:53.600 --> 08:56.201
Our spies tell us Don Carlos
left Austria under a cloud.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.737
If his ridiculously pious
father, the king of Spain,

08:58.739 --> 09:00.772
finds out the truth
of what happened there...

09:00.774 --> 09:01.907
But we don't know the truth.

09:01.909 --> 09:02.941
We know enough

09:02.943 --> 09:05.210
to strike fear in the prince.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.078
Prepare a letter.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.247
End your courtship of Mary
and leave France by dawn,

09:09.249 --> 09:12.284
or your father, the king,
will learn of your secret.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.319
Who sent this?

09:14.321 --> 09:17.155
I don't know,
Your Highness.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.724
(indistinct chatter)

09:26.667 --> 09:28.333
Has something happened?

09:28.335 --> 09:29.935
An important matter
has arisen back home.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.804
I must return to Spain
as soon as possible.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.306
Mary, I'm afraid
I won't be coming back.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.675
That's it?

09:36.677 --> 09:39.678
Our courtship is
over? Was I wrong

09:39.680 --> 09:42.080
in thinking it was going well?
My dear Mary,

09:42.082 --> 09:44.082
it's clear that your heart
is not ready.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.685
Not for another man's love. Even
less for the games of courtship.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.687
As soon as the rest
of my travel belongings

09:48.689 --> 09:51.623
arrive from Austria,
I will leave for Spain.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.892
Good-bye.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.303
(sighs)

10:09.042 --> 10:11.109
Bash.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.112
What's wrong?

10:14.114 --> 10:17.315
You seem
so far away lately.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.118
I'm just frustrated

10:20.120 --> 10:22.320
we're no closer to
catching this killer.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.689
We can't even find
his last victim.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.691
You can't blame the murders
for the distance

10:26.693 --> 10:28.126
that's come between us.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.828
It's more than that.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.998
It's Francis.
I feel it in you.
Don't.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Don't use your abilities
to get in my thoughts.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.334
These are my feelings.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.004
Bash, that's not what I...
I lost

10:39.006 --> 10:42.807
my brother, my friend,
and my king all at once.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.076
I don't need to be
told how that feels.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.845
(knocking)

10:46.847 --> 10:48.279
Sir.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.414
What is it?
We found another body

10:49.416 --> 10:50.415
near the village,

10:50.417 --> 10:52.751
missing
her heart.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.891
She's been dead for weeks.

10:59.893 --> 11:03.094
She must be the last
victim you sensed.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.763
The night we discovered
the barn.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.199
Where the killer kept
his victims' hearts.

11:08.201 --> 11:11.036
(panting)

11:11.038 --> 11:12.671
Are you feeling him now?

11:12.673 --> 11:16.207
His hatred.
His bloodlust.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.375
Can you tell where he is?

11:17.377 --> 11:19.244
Not where he is.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.845
Where he was.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.714
And where
he will be.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.450
He has plans.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.186
Tonight.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.056
(birds chirping)

11:31.058 --> 11:33.925
Majesties,

11:33.927 --> 11:35.860
it is with great honor
and solemnity

11:35.862 --> 11:38.797
I bring you the vital organs
of King Francis II

11:38.799 --> 11:42.801
for consecration
and entombment here.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.337
This will be the final vessel
for my son's remains.

11:46.339 --> 11:50.875
Commissioned in keeping
with the Valois tradition.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.411
Thank you, Cardinal Morel.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.422
Mary, we're so sorry.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.891
It's such an awful tradition
to endure.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.928
Is there anything
that we can do?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.463
No.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.264
Thank you,

12:13.266 --> 12:15.734
for being here with me.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.336
Lord chancellor.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.472
Yeah, I've been close
to this kind of power before,

12:20.474 --> 12:22.407
but that was inherited.
This has been earned.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.409
Every bit of it.
But it's power

12:24.411 --> 12:26.277
you will have
at Catherine's side.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.213
Stephan, it was only
a few weeks ago you told me

12:28.215 --> 12:30.115
we had to stay far away
from her.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.217
Catherine's fine.
She's been handled.
How? It was

12:32.219 --> 12:34.953
your betrayal that sent her
into exile and then prison.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.288
Can you really trust her?
Especially once she's regent?

12:37.290 --> 12:39.958
Catherine will be far too busy
with France's problems

12:39.960 --> 12:41.826
to worry about petty vendettas.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.762
Besides, I have a fair amount
of influence.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.331
On the council,

12:46.333 --> 12:48.266
which should be enough
to keep Catherine under control.

12:48.268 --> 12:52.203
It's not only her
political motives I don't trust.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.538
You two
were lovers once.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.973
So the
person

12:54.975 --> 12:58.209
you don't trust is me.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.145
Lola.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.281
I made a vow
to you.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.550
Do you not believe
that I can honor it?

13:05.552 --> 13:07.919
I watch the way
you conduct your business,

13:07.921 --> 13:10.021
and I can't
help observing

13:10.023 --> 13:12.056
that you and I treat honor
differently.

13:12.058 --> 13:16.294
So you'd have me turn down
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

13:16.296 --> 13:17.562
because I'm not worthy of it?

13:17.564 --> 13:19.464
I never said that.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.000
Stephan,
look at what we already have.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.068
We're safe, secure.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.204
With your swing vote
on the council, you already have

13:26.206 --> 13:28.173
leverage with Catherine
without this position.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.441
We have
each other.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.510
What more do you need?

13:34.881 --> 13:38.449
Those are Don Carlos' belongings
from Austria.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.151
CATHERINE:
He doesn't travel light,
does he?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.319
MARY:
Well, he has been travelling

13:41.321 --> 13:42.887
for some time.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.889
He'll return to Spain
once he receives them.

13:44.891 --> 13:48.960
You speak as if he's leaving
without an engagement to you.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.330
Mary, Scotland
needs Spain.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.332
Did you even try?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.467
No matter what you might think,
I can't just force men

13:56.469 --> 13:58.102
to fall in love
with me.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.938
Did he tell you why
he wouldn't marry you?

13:59.940 --> 14:02.006
No. He was so vague.

14:02.008 --> 14:05.210
I can only think of one thing
that might...
What?

14:05.212 --> 14:06.945
He seemed to dislike
that I didn't

14:06.947 --> 14:09.214
want to play a-a courting game.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.482
Where men chase women
through the woods.

14:13.587 --> 14:17.188
That is... a rather
odd request.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.924
But Mary, he would have no idea

14:19.926 --> 14:21.125
that a game like that...

14:21.127 --> 14:22.994
Where men hunt women like prey.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.095
Ending with?

14:24.097 --> 14:25.930
A kiss.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.632
It's a chasing game.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.902
A game,
nothing more.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.071
You're right.
I think what he

14:33.073 --> 14:35.874
also seeks is some certainty
that you will try,

14:35.876 --> 14:37.442
if only for
a day, to let

14:37.444 --> 14:39.544
your grief over Francis pass.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.580
To give him a chance
to warm your heart,

14:42.582 --> 14:44.249
if not to win it.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.453
MARY:
Something about his luggage
was important enough

14:52.559 --> 14:54.509
to keep him
at court.

14:54.510 --> 14:56.460
Prince Carlos' luggage is to be
stored in the wine cellar.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.464
He is not know of its arrival
or its whereabouts

14:59.466 --> 15:01.532
until you receive my order.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.070
Well done.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.208
BASH:
You're sensing a murder

15:10.210 --> 15:12.944
that hasn't
happened yet. How?

15:12.946 --> 15:15.947
I only know
that he walked this path.

15:15.949 --> 15:19.217
His mind was consumed
with the hunger to take a life.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.022
Can you focus on
the next victim?

15:25.625 --> 15:28.159
This next woman's heart

15:28.161 --> 15:30.161
vibrates with the thrill

15:30.163 --> 15:32.297
of a strange new world.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.299
A new purpose that frees her

15:34.301 --> 15:36.301
from old fears.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.336
A passion she thought
she had lost.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.174
Here. It's here
that he plans

15:43.176 --> 15:45.376
to take her heart
for himself.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.713
BASH:
This is Greer's tavern.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.117
Could she be
the killer's next target?

16:02.095 --> 16:03.461
GREER:
<i> You think I'm the next victim?</i>

16:03.463 --> 16:05.063
Delphine has yet to be wrong.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.331
She's convinced
he intends to kill tonight,

16:06.333 --> 16:08.733
and the victim--
she fits your description.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.201
For the safety of you
and your girls, I advise you

16:10.203 --> 16:12.337
to close up for the night.
Maybe longer.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.272
But if we shut down, won't he
just find some other victim?

16:14.274 --> 16:16.341
Or wait to come back
here another night?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.109
That bastard
took my niece from me.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.078
Tell me where he'll
be and we'll bloody well see

16:20.080 --> 16:21.512
how he likes having
his heart ripped out.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.114
Killing is this man's
compulsion,

16:23.116 --> 16:25.016
his passion.
He's very good at it.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.217
Fighting back is too dangerous.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.619
No. Instead of delaying
the inevitable,

16:28.621 --> 16:30.521
I say let's work
together and stop him.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.091
Forever.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.260
You may never
get a better chance.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.628
DON CARLOS:
<i> Track it down,</i>
<i> even if it takes you</i>

16:37.630 --> 16:38.763
<i> all the way back to Austria.</i>

16:38.765 --> 16:41.532
MARY:
Don Carlos.
I expected you

16:41.534 --> 16:43.501
to be long gone.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.503
I should be, but my baggage

16:45.505 --> 16:47.505
has proven
impossible to locate.
Mm.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.108
I could leave
a valet behind,

16:50.110 --> 16:51.642
but I'd rather
keep these items at hand.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.444
You understand.
I do.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.447
Perhaps we could take advantage
of your extended stay.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.049
I thought we might
entertain ourselves

16:58.051 --> 17:00.151
with the Hound and Hare
game you spoke of.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.220
I shouldn't delay my departure.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.256
And you made it clear that
such games don't interest you.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.658
That was before I realized
how much they meant to you.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.728
We can arrange to play it
later today if you'd like.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.231
You can enjoy
chasing me through the woods.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.100
Actually, you
would be chasing me.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.368
In my version
of the game,

17:17.370 --> 17:19.437
you are the hound
and I am the hare.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.174
Does the notion
upset you?

17:23.176 --> 17:25.710
No, not a bit.
Although...

17:25.712 --> 17:28.479
I do wonder why it all
matters so much to you.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.549
Let's just say
if you catch me,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.217
I'll show you why.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.654
Business must
go on as usual,

17:36.656 --> 17:37.822
so the killer
suspects nothing.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.324
My men will be
stationed throughout

17:40.326 --> 17:42.193
the tavern,
posing as customers.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.129
That customer's mine.
(women chuckle and exclaim)

17:45.131 --> 17:47.465
If you feel
threatened at all,

17:47.467 --> 17:50.368
call out.
I want to be clear
that anyone staying

17:50.370 --> 17:51.669
is risking their lives.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.371
Anyone wishing to leave
should do so now.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.608
You ladies are doing
a brave thing.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.677
Let's get ready.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.583
(indistinct conversations,
people laughing)

18:05.585 --> 18:07.318
¶ I'm ash and dust ¶

18:07.320 --> 18:09.487
¶ You burn me up
with every turn ¶

18:09.489 --> 18:12.190
DON CARLOS:
Everyone gather round. Quickly.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.459
Each man is a hare.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.228
Each woman, a hound.
No insult intended.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.864
The rules are quite simple:

18:19.866 --> 18:21.699
the hounds win
by catching a hare.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.201
And the hares win
by evading capture.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.735
Are you wearing
your mink-lined boots?

18:24.737 --> 18:27.305
Well, if I have to run,
I'm going to look good doing it.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.373
As to who catches whom,

18:29.375 --> 18:31.442
fate shall determine
the outcome.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.577
(nobles murmur excitedly)

18:32.579 --> 18:33.611
Hares,

18:33.613 --> 18:34.812
take your places.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.448
GIDEON:
It appears our letter

18:37.450 --> 18:39.617
did not frighten
the prince away.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.219
The prize of
marrying a queen

18:41.221 --> 18:42.787
seems worth the
risk of exposure.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.323
Or perhaps he is gambling that
we don't have all the facts.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.891
Well, too bad for him.
We have friends in Austria

18:46.893 --> 18:50.361
who are eager to partake
in scandalous royal gossip.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.196
¶ Break it till it's beaten ¶

18:52.198 --> 18:54.565
MAN:
Hares, prepare for the chase
of your lives!

18:56.669 --> 18:58.236
(trumpet blows)

18:58.238 --> 19:01.906
(shouting, chattering)

19:01.908 --> 19:04.675
¶ I want your love ¶

19:06.479 --> 19:09.347
Hounds, wait
for the signal.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.882
(trumpet blows)

19:10.884 --> 19:13.451
(excited chattering)

19:19.926 --> 19:20.925
Christophe.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.260
This is a game

19:22.262 --> 19:23.661
for nobles.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.929
Did anyone see you?

19:24.931 --> 19:27.665
No.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.869
You do test your limits.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.672
We have to
be discreet.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.846
What exactly do you hope
to gain by being my lover?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.481
What do you want?

19:43.483 --> 19:45.683
I want you. Under these trees.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.319
With half the nobles of
France only steps away

19:48.321 --> 19:50.388
and no walls
between us.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.592
(excited chattering)

19:56.529 --> 19:58.429
¶ Make the wind lift you up ¶

19:58.431 --> 20:01.299
¶ Until you reach the sky ¶

20:01.301 --> 20:04.769
¶ Sprinkle dust
and it can take you high ¶

20:04.771 --> 20:08.372
¶ Above the trials
of the world outside ¶

20:08.374 --> 20:10.374
(man laughing)

20:10.376 --> 20:12.510
¶ Oh ¶

20:12.512 --> 20:16.347
¶ Sunshine can make it ¶

20:16.349 --> 20:18.416
¶ Where my eyes... ¶

20:18.418 --> 20:22.386
¶ Oh ¶

20:22.388 --> 20:24.388
¶ I'm awake, I'm awakening ¶

20:24.390 --> 20:26.624
¶ Oh ¶

20:28.428 --> 20:30.828
¶ I'm awake ¶

20:30.830 --> 20:33.364
¶ I'm awakening. ¶

20:33.366 --> 20:35.700
Ooh! Aah!
(groans)

20:37.437 --> 20:39.437
Ooh.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.572
(inhales sharply)

20:41.574 --> 20:44.242
(grunting)

20:48.748 --> 20:51.616
Aah! Ooh.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.451
Don Carlos!

20:53.453 --> 20:55.386
Can anyone hear me?

20:57.523 --> 20:59.590
(Catherine moans deeply)

21:15.742 --> 21:18.309
(branch snaps)

21:19.045 --> 21:20.945
(rustling)

21:24.517 --> 21:27.918
Hounds are meant to tag
their hares, not stab them.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.454
And hares are supposed
to run from hounds,

21:30.456 --> 21:32.790
not stand around
foolishly, gawking.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.894
I have quite another hare
to catch today.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.597
Not like that, you won't.
Your ankle needs treatment,

21:39.599 --> 21:41.799
and night's almost fallen. I'm
taking you back to the castle.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.933
Oh!

21:42.935 --> 21:44.468
How dare you!

21:44.470 --> 21:45.870
Believe me, this
isn't what I had in mind

21:45.872 --> 21:47.938
for the game, either.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.418
(panting)

22:00.420 --> 22:02.019
You're light as a feather,
I swear.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.421
Well, thank you
for that.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.356
I could walk.

22:05.358 --> 22:05.923
No, just give
me a minute.

22:11.030 --> 22:14.332
Queen Mary, I realize I'm the
last person you would trust,

22:14.334 --> 22:16.100
but I feel I
should tell you.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.502
You may think Don Carlos is
the answer to your troubles,

22:18.504 --> 22:19.770
but he will only bring more.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.105
I'm not taking marriage advice

22:21.107 --> 22:22.707
from one of my enemies,
thank you.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.742
The prince
harbors a secret.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.444
A dark one.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.712
Anna of Austria expelled him

22:27.714 --> 22:28.746
from her court
for that very reason.

22:28.748 --> 22:29.980
Why the sudden concern

22:29.982 --> 22:31.349
for my well-being?

22:31.351 --> 22:32.983
Perhaps Queen Elizabeth

22:32.985 --> 22:35.052
would like to keep me
from marrying Spain?

22:35.054 --> 22:38.055
Maybe I'm saving your life and I
don't want to waste the effort.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.924
My silence would be as wrong
as leaving you

22:39.926 --> 22:41.625
helpless back there
in the woods.

22:41.627 --> 22:44.929
Oh, very well. I'll bite.
What is this terrible rumor?

22:44.931 --> 22:46.931
Our spies only know
that it's something...

22:46.933 --> 22:49.600
sexual.
Some object

22:49.602 --> 22:51.736
the prince showed to Anna
which she found abhorrent.

22:51.738 --> 22:52.903
JEFFREY: My lord.
Something
that's traveled

22:52.905 --> 22:54.638
to France with him, no doubt.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.474
If Don Carlos' secret
scared Anna,

22:56.476 --> 22:57.742
it should
scare you, too.

22:57.744 --> 23:00.511
Ah, Jeffrey,
you found us.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.880
The queen has injured her ankle.
Ensure she gets back safely.

23:09.155 --> 23:12.022
(indistinct conversations,
laughing)

23:14.761 --> 23:16.093
Mind if I join you?

23:21.834 --> 23:23.134
Are you frightened?

23:23.136 --> 23:25.136
A little. I could
use some company.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.671
And it's been ages
since we last talked.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.109
Why is that pin
on your cloak?

23:32.111 --> 23:33.978
That? It's, uh,
it's nothing. I, uh...

23:33.980 --> 23:36.580
Nothing? I've seen

23:36.582 --> 23:39.450
and admired that pearl ornament
on Princess Claude many times.

23:39.452 --> 23:42.787
Leith, was it given to
you as a lady's favor?

23:42.789 --> 23:46.557
Uh, I would, um,
appreciate you keeping this

23:46.559 --> 23:48.793
to yourself.
The relationship is new.

23:48.795 --> 23:49.994
And, yes, the princess
is even further

23:49.996 --> 23:51.662
above my station
than you were.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.731
You needn't explain
yourself to me.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.932
Ever since we parted
ways, I hoped

23:54.934 --> 23:56.033
you would find
someone special.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.868
No matter their station.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.203
If only things were that simple.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.105
Love is never simple.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.840
Not that I'm any expert.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.942
The closest I've come
to a romance since you

24:04.944 --> 24:06.744
was a misguided
dalliance with a pirate.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.817
Could we have found anyone
further from our stations?

24:12.819 --> 24:16.053
I've learned that stations
mean too much to too many.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.122
In truth, I think we can
only hope for happiness.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.723
And are you happy?

24:21.928 --> 24:23.694
I like running this business.

24:23.696 --> 24:26.697
I like my girls,
the independence.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.833
Is that happiness?
I can't tell anymore.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.701
Life is full
of surprises,

24:30.703 --> 24:32.803
and what we make of them
is up to us.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.973
I suppose I've realized,

24:35.975 --> 24:37.675
especially on an evening
like this,

24:37.677 --> 24:40.878
that we're all lucky
just to be alive.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.723
Narcisse.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.626
Did you come here
to accept my offer

24:55.628 --> 24:56.861
as lord chancellor,

24:56.863 --> 24:58.696
or are you here
in my bedroom to tell me

24:58.698 --> 25:00.764
again how much
you love your wife?

25:00.766 --> 25:03.033
Were I were your chancellor,
I would advise you:

25:03.035 --> 25:06.203
you're taking a terrible risk
with that servant boy.

25:06.205 --> 25:09.006
What servant boy?
You were in
the woods

25:09.008 --> 25:10.241
with him during that game.

25:10.243 --> 25:12.243
You could have
been seen by anyone.

25:12.245 --> 25:13.711
But we were seen by you.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.613
How exciting.

25:15.615 --> 25:19.083
Oh, you're trapped in a marriage
to that dull girl

25:19.085 --> 25:21.619
and you come across
an act of such passion.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.621
Oh, you were watching

25:23.623 --> 25:26.690
me and my servant boy.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.926
A young creature
not only ready but willing.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.694
Tireless.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.063
Hungry.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.899
I know you're hungry, too.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.534
For power,

25:36.536 --> 25:38.836
danger and pleasure.

25:38.838 --> 25:40.604
You want more.

25:40.606 --> 25:42.573
So take it.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.848
I will give you
my vote.

25:50.850 --> 25:54.051
But you will discard
that plaything.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.653
I didn't say bargain.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.088
I said take.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.824
That's what my servant boy does.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.637
(indistinct conversations)

26:13.639 --> 26:15.039
It's almost dawn.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.308
There hasn't been
a new customer in hours.

26:17.310 --> 26:20.110
Perhaps I misread
the feeling I had.

26:20.112 --> 26:25.683
I felt his
intent, but...

26:25.685 --> 26:27.918
We've done all we can here.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.021
Dismiss the men. I'll alert
those stationed upstairs.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.725
Gents.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.093
Sir.
Sir.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.011
Off, then.

26:37.012 --> 26:37.928
It was good to see you.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.730
And you as well.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.799
Good luck.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.942
(door closes)

26:54.013 --> 26:56.080
Oh, Leith.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.248
WOMAN:
See you tomorrow.
Leith.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.950
Your cloak.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.286
(horse neighs)

27:02.288 --> 27:03.988
Leith.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.966
What is it? What's wrong?

27:15.968 --> 27:18.102
(panting)

27:18.104 --> 27:21.639
Oh, I can feel him again.

27:25.678 --> 27:26.910
What do you want?
Stay away.

27:26.912 --> 27:28.045
(whimpers)

27:28.047 --> 27:29.980
Aah!
(grunts)

27:29.982 --> 27:31.649
(screams)

27:36.188 --> 27:37.888
(grunting)

27:41.994 --> 27:43.394
Is that him?
He attacked me.

27:43.396 --> 27:44.962
Ah, what is that?

27:44.964 --> 27:46.730
Did you vomit on yourself?

27:46.732 --> 27:48.265
He came at me so fast.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.834
Who is he?
Is he the man we want?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.703
I don't think this is our
killer. A drunk, yes.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.805
Probably trying to rob
you. Are you hurt?

27:54.807 --> 27:57.007
No, he, uh, he didn't hit me,
he just pushed me.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.443
I'm just shaken.
Fine now, thanks to you.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.847
(thumping)

28:03.849 --> 28:05.382
Bash?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.785
Delphine sensed the killer's
presence, I heard your scream,

28:07.787 --> 28:10.688
so I... but if this
isn't the killer...

28:10.690 --> 28:11.822
Bash?

28:11.824 --> 28:13.957
(screaming)

28:13.959 --> 28:17.361
(hooded figure panting loudly,
Delphine groaning)

28:17.363 --> 28:19.329
(loud, guttural gasping)

28:19.331 --> 28:20.798
(groans)

28:20.800 --> 28:22.466
(loud, gasping breathing)

28:28.207 --> 28:30.274
(shallow breathing)

28:35.181 --> 28:37.748
(loud, wheezy breathing)

28:37.750 --> 28:41.051
Delphine...
what happened?

28:41.053 --> 28:43.454
(yelling)
Delphine?

28:43.456 --> 28:45.989
(yelling)
(grunts)

28:48.094 --> 28:49.993
(sighs)
It's all right.

28:49.995 --> 28:52.429
It's Sebastian.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.100
You're safe now.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.968
(panting)

28:57.970 --> 29:01.238
(barking)

29:02.842 --> 29:06.410
(sighs)

29:12.418 --> 29:15.419
(inhales and exhales loudly)

29:34.140 --> 29:37.040
(groans softly, gasps)

29:37.042 --> 29:39.109
Three hours,
waiting for you in the woods.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.878
Did you even
try to find me?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.846
I hurt my ankle.

29:42.848 --> 29:45.315
You arranged to have my luggage
hidden to keep me from leaving.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.017
I thought I enjoyed
playing games,

29:47.019 --> 29:48.886
but clearly, I've met my match.

29:48.888 --> 29:51.421
Scotland needs
a new alliance quickly.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.056
I am not playing games.

29:53.058 --> 29:57.494
I am just looking for answers,
answers I am entitled to.

29:58.864 --> 30:01.298
I couldn't agree more.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.167
Let me show you.

30:03.169 --> 30:06.370
(door squeaks open)

30:09.341 --> 30:12.876
What is it?

30:12.878 --> 30:15.445
Some people call it a sex horse
because of its shape.

30:15.447 --> 30:19.049
Just a name.

30:19.051 --> 30:23.086
It's a device that helps
fulfill my desires.

30:23.088 --> 30:25.422
I still don't quite
understand how...

30:25.424 --> 30:27.591
The device is for me.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.293
My partner need only to whip me.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.461
It may seem
odd to you,

30:31.463 --> 30:34.498
but to me, pain equals pleasure.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.600
Oh.

30:36.602 --> 30:40.838
I need a woman like you, who
I hope is willing to give me

30:40.840 --> 30:42.840
what I need, and the
fact that you are still

30:42.842 --> 30:46.176
standing here gives me hope
that you are such a woman.

30:46.178 --> 30:49.213
But isn't this dangerous? There
are already rumors of your...

30:49.215 --> 30:51.448
particular desires.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.584
It's only a matter of time
before the Vatican learns.

30:53.586 --> 30:55.219
Or your father.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.354
And I would be called deviant
and unfit to rule,

30:57.356 --> 30:58.956
lose everything.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.524
Do you really need all this?

31:00.526 --> 31:04.895
Yes. The marriage
I want is this.

31:04.897 --> 31:07.865
You will give me
pain as a gift,

31:07.867 --> 31:10.100
but I will only
give you kindness.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.535
And one day,
I will be king

31:11.537 --> 31:13.604
of Spain with all of
its unmatched might and wealth.

31:13.606 --> 31:16.073
And you and I will rule
our two countries together.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.876
Try it,
one time.
Oh.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.344
Can you do that for me?

31:20.346 --> 31:22.145
For us?

31:22.147 --> 31:24.314
For Scotland?

31:25.951 --> 31:28.485
Don Carlos, there is so much
I admire about you.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.587
But you say
the marriage you want

31:30.589 --> 31:34.358
is this, and...
I want something else.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.460
I'm sorry,

31:36.462 --> 31:38.328
but I can't.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.301
And you didn't
see his face?

31:44.303 --> 31:45.936
Bash, I've told you.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.938
I was too scared to turn.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.139
The killer attacked,
then withdrew.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.974
There must be
an explanation.

31:50.976 --> 31:52.943
What changed his mind? What made
him decide to spare your life?

31:52.945 --> 31:54.912
I don't know.
All I know is

31:54.914 --> 31:57.314
the sensations that
led me to the tavern.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.348
They weren't about Greer.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.117
A strange new world.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.252
A passion she thought lost.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.154
New purpose.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.223
That was you.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.292
That's how I feel here with you.

32:08.294 --> 32:12.296
But now, I must get away
from this place, away from you.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.131
I won't let you leave.
Don't you see?

32:14.133 --> 32:16.433
When he touched me,
there was a connection.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.269
His urges flowed into me.
I think it caused him

32:19.271 --> 32:22.239
to lose those urges,
at least for a moment.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.309
Bash, in that instant,
I wanted you dead.

32:25.311 --> 32:29.112
You, the one person
I truly care for.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.447
I won't risk that again.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.316
We can't give up now.
We are so close.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.017
Delphine, when I told you

32:34.019 --> 32:37.054
I wanted you out of my head,
I was just scared.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.423
Any time I've opened myself up,
I've been hurt.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.459
My brother, my wife, my parents.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.194
But with you,
it feels different.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.430
It's a risk, you're right--

32:46.432 --> 32:48.465
our hearts, our lives--

32:48.467 --> 32:50.434
but you make me want to.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.736
Please.

32:52.738 --> 32:55.105
Will you risk it all with me?

33:07.386 --> 33:10.020
(indistinct chatter)

33:15.661 --> 33:17.761
Your Grace.

33:17.763 --> 33:21.765
We will now vote to confirm
the queen mother as regent

33:21.767 --> 33:24.434
of France. If there
are no objections,

33:24.436 --> 33:26.770
I move to confirm.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.672
Do I have a second?

33:28.674 --> 33:30.307
(man coughs)

33:30.309 --> 33:33.477
(man clears his throat)

33:34.646 --> 33:37.114
Very well. All those

33:37.116 --> 33:38.782
in favor?
(door opens)

33:38.784 --> 33:42.519
In this urn is proof
our late King Francis

33:42.521 --> 33:45.522
was murdered. The king's liver.
Physicians say

33:45.524 --> 33:47.791
blackness like this demonstrates
he was poisoned.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.393
We found it when shifting

33:49.395 --> 33:52.329
his remains to this urn.
How can that be possible?

33:52.331 --> 33:55.799
I asked Francis if he thought
his illness was poison,

33:55.801 --> 33:57.334
and he insisted that it wasn't.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.802
His doctors confirmed it.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.670
Some poisons
can escape detection.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.672
Only an expert knows
what they are.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.711
You think that I killed my son?!

34:07.713 --> 34:10.714
Every councillor here knows
you've long sought the position

34:10.716 --> 34:12.282
of regent,
even before Francis died.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.518
I loved him. He was my son!

34:14.520 --> 34:16.553
Are you out of your mind?

34:16.555 --> 34:18.055
This crime must be investigated.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.557
We recommend that
your regency not

34:20.559 --> 34:22.325
be confirmed
until it's done.

34:22.327 --> 34:24.528
Narcisse, you cannot
let this continue.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.263
The queen mother is right.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.498
She must be treated
with all the respect

34:28.500 --> 34:30.767
that befits
her station, and

34:30.769 --> 34:33.370
she must be given time
to build a defense,

34:33.372 --> 34:37.074
one which I'm sure
will exonerate her.

34:37.076 --> 34:41.344
We gathered here today
because France needs a leader,

34:41.346 --> 34:44.414
and quickly, as the queen
mother has often reminded us.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.684
That has not changed,
no matter who

34:47.686 --> 34:50.353
bears the blame for
this hideous crime.

34:50.355 --> 34:53.490
If the Church will not bless
the queen mother's election, and

34:53.492 --> 34:55.158
no one else will step forward,

34:55.160 --> 34:56.860
I will offer myself.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.528
What?

34:58.530 --> 35:00.597
You snake.

35:00.599 --> 35:04.468
I would assume the
position reluctantly,

35:04.470 --> 35:07.471
for as long as I have
the council's confidence,

35:07.473 --> 35:09.706
and only until
King Charles comes of age.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.575
He doesn't come
of age for years.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.243
You will be
acting as king.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.378
You are usurping
the Valois family!

35:15.380 --> 35:18.748
I humbly ask for a motion.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.884
Now you're willing to vote
when the candidate isn't me?

35:20.886 --> 35:22.886
Do I have a second?
And all those

35:22.888 --> 35:24.654
in favor?
(indistinct chatter)

35:24.656 --> 35:26.189
MAN:
I agree.

35:26.191 --> 35:30.393
With your help and God's,

35:30.395 --> 35:33.330
I hope
I will rule my country well.

35:35.634 --> 35:39.369
Long live France.

35:39.371 --> 35:40.904
Forget the regency.
I'm finished.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.807
<i>Oh!</i> If I can't

35:43.809 --> 35:45.809
disprove these charges,
I will swing from a rope!

35:45.811 --> 35:47.878
Queens are not so easily undone.
You taught me that.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.379
I will help you.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.648
Help yourself, Mary.
Wed Don Carlos.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.151
If you thought that
Scotland could rely on me,

35:54.153 --> 35:56.520
on France, you were wrong,
because I am<i> nothing</i> now!

35:56.522 --> 35:58.922
Even if I survive this,
the regency is lost to me.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.358
But you will fight...
I will fight it.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.226
But right now,
I am fighting for you.

36:03.228 --> 36:05.695
Marry the man.
Forget his peculiarities.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.431
It's not just that.
There are...

36:08.433 --> 36:10.167
There are other options,
princes, kings.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.269
Like whom?
Eric of Sweden?

36:12.271 --> 36:14.538
Frederick of Denmark? Do you
know who else is pursuing them?

36:14.540 --> 36:16.740
Elizabeth. And she has a much
bigger country to offer them.

36:16.742 --> 36:20.210
You don't understand what he's
asking, what he wants from me,

36:20.212 --> 36:23.213
what he wants me to do.
I don't judge him, but...

36:23.215 --> 36:27.284
Well, what is it then?
He has this... contraption.

36:27.286 --> 36:30.420
It's for him, not me. I wouldn't
be getting hurt at all, but...

36:30.422 --> 36:32.589
Oh, but he would be?

36:32.591 --> 36:36.426
He wants me to give
the experience a test run.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.495
Then simply pass the test
and marry the man.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.865
How you conduct yourself beyond
that you can figure out later,

36:41.867 --> 36:44.267
once you have Spain
in your pocket.

36:44.269 --> 36:45.569
Come now.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.337
I'll help you.

36:48.473 --> 36:50.840
Mary.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.983
I was surprised to hear
that you wanted to join me.

36:59.985 --> 37:04.454
I realized I may have
been hasty in my answer.

37:04.456 --> 37:09.459
If this passion is so important
to you in marriage, then...

37:09.461 --> 37:11.328
I will try it.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.963
Are you sure?

37:12.965 --> 37:14.831
I would never
force you.
I know.

37:14.833 --> 37:17.400
I am sure.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.808
(sighs)

37:37.289 --> 37:39.656
I'd do it myself, but...

37:41.593 --> 37:43.727
A little tighter, not too...

37:43.729 --> 37:46.896
That's good. Now...

37:48.033 --> 37:49.366
The whip.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.968
Oh.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.376
I'm sorry. This
is all just...

37:59.378 --> 38:01.745
Think of it as an adventure.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.980
One that you're leading.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.316
It's also... I'm just

38:06.318 --> 38:07.784
feeling so self-conscious.

38:07.786 --> 38:12.656
Um... would you mind if...?

38:12.658 --> 38:14.791
A blindfold?

38:14.793 --> 38:16.459
I like that idea.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.465
Ah.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.471
Just a minute.
Almost ready.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.676
What's that?

38:32.678 --> 38:34.511
I'm just making sure
the door is locked.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.783
(sighs)

38:40.986 --> 38:42.552
Now, what do I...?

38:42.554 --> 38:44.621
It helps
if you create a scenario.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.823
Tell me why
I must be punished.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.694
MARY:
Oh, Lord. Um,

38:50.696 --> 38:52.729
I'm very disappointed in you?

38:52.731 --> 38:54.631
Um...

38:54.633 --> 38:56.866
(laughs)

38:56.868 --> 38:59.602
You've been a very bad man,

38:59.604 --> 39:01.705
Prince Carlos.
I have.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.940
Yes, I have.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.676
Now, you must face
your punishment.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.479
Oh! (laughs)
You must really suffer.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.448
Oh. Yes!
And feel really awful.

39:11.450 --> 39:12.982
(groans)
Sheer remorse.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.784
Oh! Aah!

39:14.786 --> 39:16.886
Is it too much?
I don't... No.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.688
Stop! Just from the sound
of your screaming,

39:18.690 --> 39:20.757
I think maybe we should stop.
Who are you talking to?!

39:20.759 --> 39:22.459
You. I'm talking to you.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.761
No, not the blindfold!
Oh.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.964
Mary! I trusted you!

39:27.966 --> 39:31.101
The secret-- it's everything!
I could be ruined!

39:31.103 --> 39:33.136
We were just trying
to please you.
You think this is a joke?!

39:33.138 --> 39:34.938
No! No! (gasps)
No, believe me,
no judgment here.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.706
I love a good...
(grunting)

39:37.609 --> 39:40.410
(muffled scream)

39:45.083 --> 39:47.050
(Catherine gasps)
Catherine, what happened?

39:47.052 --> 39:49.919
There's something in the back
of his head. (gasps sharply)

39:49.921 --> 39:52.989
Is he dead?

39:52.991 --> 39:56.726
(whimpers)

39:56.728 --> 39:58.428
What...?
No, don't look.

39:58.430 --> 39:59.763
He's cracked
his skull open.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.631
He's impaled it
on that... thing.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.433
(gasps)
Oh, we have to get help.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.135
Aah! It's too
late. He's dead!

40:05.137 --> 40:07.604
Don't you see, Mary? We've
broken the prince of Spain!

40:07.606 --> 40:09.506
The wrath of his father
will rain down upon us.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.641
Oh, my Lord. Oh, my Lord.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.042
We have to contain this.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.677
Conceal our...

40:14.679 --> 40:17.113
Mary?

40:18.550 --> 40:20.917
Where is he?
(woman screaming)

40:20.919 --> 40:23.987
(groaning,
woman continues screaming)

40:23.989 --> 40:25.755
MAN:
My lord.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.558
CATHERINE:
How is he still alive?

40:33.465 --> 40:40.670
What do we do now?
