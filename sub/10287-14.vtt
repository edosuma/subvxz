00:02.701 --> 00:06.261
Sir. Miss Harper. the assigned
legal-aid attorney. hasn't shown up yet.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.599
-Give her a few more minutes.
-Yes. sir.

00:08.773 --> 00:13.233
-Hey. Mac. you wanna see something neat?
-Oh. could I. sir?

00:13.778 --> 00:15.298
Come here.

00:16.046 --> 00:19.506
Look. Ta-da.

00:19.683 --> 00:20.713
Wow.

00:20.884 --> 00:23.514
Thanks for sharing that. sir.

00:23.687 --> 00:25.677
Those are sea monkeys. Mac.

00:25.856 --> 00:30.346
Yeah. Cute little fellas. aren't they?

00:30.527 --> 00:33.327
Okay. I admit they're small.
but they're definitely in there.

00:33.497 --> 00:34.557
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

00:34.731 --> 00:37.791
-Your Honor. I was wondering--
-Hey. Dan. come here. look at this.

00:39.803 --> 00:42.243
Oh. Harry....

00:43.406 --> 00:45.896
-Finest sea monkeys I've ever seen.
-Yeah.

00:46.075 --> 00:48.405
I've been seeing ads for these
for years in comics.

00:48.578 --> 00:51.508
I finally broke down and bought some.
They come in this package.

00:51.681 --> 00:54.051
You just add water
and stir them up. and voila.

00:54.217 --> 00:57.947
Instant pets. Heh. You're really an '80s
kind of guy. aren't you. Your Honor?

00:58.120 --> 01:00.680
Yeah. And they do tricks too. Watch this.

01:03.459 --> 01:05.829
Look at them go. huh?

01:06.696 --> 01:09.496
-Can you see what they're doing?
-Yes. sir.

01:09.665 --> 01:11.525
They're settling.

01:12.268 --> 01:14.098
Sorry I'm late.
First they send me to Brooklyn.

01:14.270 --> 01:16.000
I get to Brooklyn.
they send me to Manhattan.

01:16.171 --> 01:18.471
Mixed me up with some other attorney.
Sue Harper.

01:18.639 --> 01:21.439
Same last name. short girl.
red hair. do you know her?

01:21.609 --> 01:24.369
I grab a cab. rush over.
interview my clients and here I am.

01:24.545 --> 01:26.875
It's gonna be a pleasure
working with you. Judge Stone.

01:27.047 --> 01:28.907
That's Judge Stone.

01:29.917 --> 01:32.207
The guy with the jar of silt?

01:32.385 --> 01:34.645
-Welcome. Miss Harper.
-Oh. Your Honor. Heh.

01:34.821 --> 01:37.451
-Ready whenever you are. sir.
-Okay. just a minute. Bull.

01:37.624 --> 01:41.064
I had another package of sea monkeys.
I thought I'd whip up a fresh batch.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.697
-Now. where are they?
-I took them. sir.

01:44.898 --> 01:47.488
-I didn't know you wanted them both.
-Oh. that's okay. Bull.

01:47.666 --> 01:49.996
Thank you. sir.
But if you want my opinion...

01:50.168 --> 01:54.258
...I still think the kind
with the little alphabet noodles taste better.

02:41.753 --> 02:43.193
First case. Your Honor.

02:43.355 --> 02:45.875
-What do we got?
-Take a peek.

02:46.058 --> 02:49.358
She's also there. They didn't say
there would be all these people.

02:49.528 --> 02:51.458
BULL:
Settle down. everybody. Stop the talking.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.120
MAN 2: You don't have to push me.
MAN 3: Hey!

02:54.299 --> 02:57.699
The little fella said to be quiet.

03:05.509 --> 03:09.309
Has this place been checked
for alien listening devices?

03:10.815 --> 03:12.505
IWHISTLESI

03:12.683 --> 03:13.813
All clear.

03:15.753 --> 03:19.523
Incredible what they can do
with microchips. isn't it?

03:20.291 --> 03:23.961
I've got a radar installation in my pants.

03:25.229 --> 03:27.429
It's better to be safe than sorry.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.595
-Dan. are they wearing pajamas?
-Hmm? I'll check.

03:31.768 --> 03:36.228
-Hey. I really like your pajamas.
-Thank you.

03:36.406 --> 03:39.596
-Yup.
-Would the defense step forward. please?

03:42.044 --> 03:43.534
MAN 1: I'm sorry.
-He meant me. really.

03:43.712 --> 03:46.702
-You all don't have to come up here.
-They don't want us to hear.

03:46.882 --> 03:49.942
-They wanna tell secrets about us.
-Don't take that personally.

03:50.119 --> 03:51.679
He's not in his right mind.

03:51.854 --> 03:54.454
-Hey. thanks. big guy.
-Mr. Prosecutor....

03:54.622 --> 03:57.322
He's about 7'4" and mentally unstable.
Your Honor.

03:58.559 --> 04:01.999
-Say. thanks. big guy.
-You're welcome.

04:02.163 --> 04:04.503
According to this.
the defendants are inpatients...

04:04.666 --> 04:06.856
...at the Morningdale
Psychiatric Hospital.

04:07.035 --> 04:08.655
[IN HIGH VOICE]
Hey. what about me?

04:10.270 --> 04:12.330
-Pardon?
-There are five of us.

04:12.506 --> 04:15.366
-You forgot me. stupid.
-That's Gilbert.

04:15.542 --> 04:18.531
He's. um. Alan's other personality.
Your Honor.

04:19.112 --> 04:24.352
Sir. I called the hospital to let them know
that their patients are still on this planet.

04:24.518 --> 04:26.988
Thanks. you've obviously had
prior experience with--

04:27.154 --> 04:28.524
Unhealthy minds? Oh. yeah.

04:28.688 --> 04:31.778
In Nam. one guy in our unit
really burnt out all his circuits.

04:31.957 --> 04:34.817
Went running around the compound
screaming. "Kill. kill."

04:34.994 --> 04:36.334
Crazy as hell. boy.

04:36.762 --> 04:39.252
-What did they do with him?
-Made him an officer.

04:42.068 --> 04:44.698
-IIN NORMAL VOICE] Hi.
-Hi. what's the problem?

04:45.137 --> 04:48.657
My father.
He never showed me any affection.

04:49.141 --> 04:52.271
-I meant the legal problem.
-Uh. Your Honor. in a nutshell....

04:52.445 --> 04:54.805
[LAUGHS]

04:56.448 --> 05:01.608
To summarize. uh. they took a long
taxicab ride and then refused to pay for it.

05:01.786 --> 05:06.086
ISHOUTINGI From the West Side where
they flagged me. over to Gracie Mansion...

05:06.257 --> 05:09.387
...to downtown. back to the U.N.

05:09.561 --> 05:12.331
You wanna talk about hell on wheels!

05:13.231 --> 05:16.791
-Shot in the dark. cab driver?
-Elmore Watkins. Your Honor.

05:16.968 --> 05:20.928
And when I finally dropped them
at city hall. they stiffed me.

05:21.106 --> 05:23.436
Claimed they didn't have no money
in their pajamas.

05:23.608 --> 05:27.308
All right. Elmore.
There's really no need to yell.

05:27.478 --> 05:31.178
Who's yelling? I always talk like this.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.908
Your Honor. a brief struggle ensued.

05:34.082 --> 05:36.142
-Now. nothing serious--
ELMORE: Nothing serious?

05:36.318 --> 05:40.188
-This guy here punched me.
-IAS GILBERT] You started it. melon head.

05:40.622 --> 05:43.722
-That hand is lying. Your Honor.
HARRY: All right.

05:43.892 --> 05:46.732
All right. let's put a lid on it. huh?

05:47.395 --> 05:49.915
My name is Wendell.

05:50.098 --> 05:53.118
Uh. yeah. Wendell Martin.
Yes. I see that here.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.630
Does the prosecution
have anything material to add?

05:55.803 --> 05:57.463
What's your name?

05:58.871 --> 06:00.361
Dan.

06:01.106 --> 06:05.066
Can you say "Dan"?

06:06.445 --> 06:08.735
-Dan--
-Good.

06:13.885 --> 06:16.215
Wendell. we really have to
keep things moving here.

06:16.387 --> 06:19.287
We only have about
three hours till dinner.

06:20.724 --> 06:26.034
-Look at the size of that guy.
-Must be a gland problem.

06:26.196 --> 06:30.566
-I bet he's taller than you.
-So. what am I. a pygmy?

06:30.734 --> 06:35.504
So he's taller. so what?
You're more lumbering.

06:36.773 --> 06:38.643
Thank you. Selma.

06:38.809 --> 06:42.069
I don't see anything to suggest
premeditation. do you. Mr. Prosecutor?

06:42.245 --> 06:46.705
Hey. nice suit. Who shines it for you?

06:46.883 --> 06:51.653
-Why don't you put a mitten on it?
-All right. no more name-calling. huh?

06:52.355 --> 06:55.615
-This is Ann. Your Honor.
-Hi. Ann.

06:57.027 --> 06:58.857
I don't think she'll answer you. Harry.

06:59.029 --> 07:01.429
-She never talks at all.
-Never?

07:01.865 --> 07:05.595
She hasn't said a word to anyone
in seven years.

07:09.940 --> 07:12.430
Well. she ain't gonna start now.

07:13.844 --> 07:15.004
Mr. Watkins....

07:15.177 --> 07:18.077
Your Honor.
these people should be locked up.

07:18.247 --> 07:21.877
They have been locked up. And that's
exactly why they were in your cab.

07:25.854 --> 07:27.914
Is it just me. or did you follow that?

07:30.792 --> 07:32.062
What I meant. Your Honor...

07:32.227 --> 07:35.887
...is the reason they wanted Mr. Watkins
to take them someplace. anyplace...

07:36.064 --> 07:39.634
...was so that they could report abuses
that were occurring at the hospital.

07:39.801 --> 07:41.741
-What sort of abuses?
-Um....

07:42.237 --> 07:44.297
We made a list.

07:51.713 --> 07:53.613
It's. uh. kind of hard to read.

07:53.781 --> 07:56.341
It's kind of hard to write on.

07:57.318 --> 08:00.248
They never said nothing
about reporting abuses.

08:00.421 --> 08:05.291
They were too busy taking turns
rolling my windows up and down.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.590
Oh. thank God they're all right.

08:07.762 --> 08:10.462
-They didn't kill anybody. did they?
-No.

08:10.632 --> 08:14.132
I just want you to know
that I am very. very cross with you people.

08:14.302 --> 08:15.862
Excuse me. you are?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.057
Oh. Dr. Laurence Osborne.
Morningdale Hospital.

08:18.238 --> 08:20.538
I got here as quickly as I could.
Your Honor.

08:20.706 --> 08:26.146
Doctor. this is Dan. my new friend.

08:27.079 --> 08:29.379
Tell your friend he dresses like a clown.

08:29.547 --> 08:32.407
Alan. knock it off.

08:33.150 --> 08:34.311
Don't let him fool you.

08:34.485 --> 08:37.715
True multiple personalities
are practically non-existent.

08:37.888 --> 08:42.847
-Isn't it possible that he's the exception?
-Can't you see his lips moving?

08:44.528 --> 08:47.958
-Conference. Your Honor.
-Yeah. Excuse us. doctor.

08:49.732 --> 08:52.392
-What you got. Dan?
-A face like a grapefruit.

08:54.202 --> 08:55.672
We're dealing with misdemeanors.

08:55.837 --> 08:59.167
I say we drop the charges. and get
these people back to Hotel Happiness.

08:59.341 --> 09:01.171
-If there's no objection--
-Objection.

09:01.343 --> 09:04.873
I don't think you understand what just
happened here. He dropped the case.

09:05.047 --> 09:07.607
I'm not gonna let you
railroad these people out of here.

09:07.783 --> 09:11.123
Now. judge. I feel it is imperative
that my clients be given a chance...

09:11.286 --> 09:13.276
...to air their grievances in open court.

09:13.455 --> 09:15.315
Their grievances are not the issue here.

09:15.490 --> 09:19.220
And besides. I think there's a
pretty big question as to their competency.

09:19.394 --> 09:21.894
No one has offered any proof
that they're incompetent.

09:22.064 --> 09:25.734
Proof? The guy over there
is conversing with his fist.

09:26.668 --> 09:30.398
I'm afraid I gotta go along
with Dan on this one. counselor.

09:30.572 --> 09:32.402
Due to the. uh. unusual circumstances...

09:32.574 --> 09:35.374
...the court drops the charges
against the defendants...

09:35.544 --> 09:38.384
...and remands them
to the custody of their psychiatrist.

09:38.847 --> 09:43.377
All right. come along. people.
That's enough reality for one day.

09:47.756 --> 09:50.816
-We're being poisoned. you know.
-In the hospital?

09:50.993 --> 09:53.963
No. no. our entire planet.

09:54.128 --> 09:57.958
By the forces of intergalactic evil:
microbes. germs. bacteria...

09:58.131 --> 10:01.001
...reproducing themselves
at a rate you would not believe.

10:01.901 --> 10:05.361
That's why it's so important
to brush after every meal.

10:06.106 --> 10:10.036
-Mr. Dworkin.
-Hey. what about me?

10:10.210 --> 10:14.270
Them eight-balls waltz out of here.
and I get nothing for my trouble?

10:14.447 --> 10:17.937
Ha. ha! I don't believe this.
This is insane.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.108
Depends on your point of view.
Mr. Watkins.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.516
Insane seems to be a relative term.
Right. Mac?

10:23.690 --> 10:27.560
I saw them swimming around.
I swear. sir.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.194
Hey. did they come through here?

10:30.363 --> 10:33.263
-Who. your patients?
-As soon as I was in the corridor. they...

10:33.433 --> 10:36.733
-...grabbed my bag and made a run for it.
-Bull. seal off the building.

10:36.903 --> 10:40.533
-For Heaven's sakes. get that bag back.
-I assume there were drugs in that bag?

10:40.707 --> 10:43.107
-Among other things.
-Among what other things?

10:43.276 --> 10:46.006
Well. a syringe. a stethoscope.
a blood-pressure cuff...

10:46.179 --> 10:48.009
...a revolver. Ahem.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.481
-Did you say a revolver?
-Mac. call security.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.779
Look. my wife always worries
about my safety...

10:52.951 --> 10:55.221
...so she gave it to me
as an anniversary present.

10:55.387 --> 10:59.377
-Eleven years. that's steel.
-What do I tell security. sir?

10:59.557 --> 11:03.547
We're looking for mentally unhinged people
that have a bagful of drugs and a weapon.

11:03.727 --> 11:06.157
Yeah. and one of them is 7'4"
and they're all wearing pajamas.

11:06.329 --> 11:07.589
[LAUGHS]

11:08.265 --> 11:10.695
I wanna listen on the extension.

11:15.972 --> 11:19.412
I really didn't need this.
If anything happens. I'll feel so responsible.

11:19.576 --> 11:20.866
You are responsible.

11:21.043 --> 11:23.943
All right. people.
let's not chew up the furniture. huh?

11:24.113 --> 11:26.913
I'm sure they're still here
in the building...

11:28.516 --> 11:29.916
...somewhere.

11:30.085 --> 11:32.915
-Oh. Wendell. what are you doing?
-Hiding.

11:33.088 --> 11:37.458
Ain't gonna work for you indoors. Wendell.
No cloud cover.

11:37.625 --> 11:40.115
Wendell. where are the others?

11:40.829 --> 11:44.269
All I know is.
they don't wanna go back to Morningdale.

11:44.432 --> 11:47.422
-It's not nice.
-Not nice?

11:47.602 --> 11:50.942
We just updated all the finger-paint sets.

11:51.106 --> 11:55.166
Obviously. there are some real problems
or these people wouldn't have done this.

11:55.343 --> 11:58.473
Exactly. Obviously. there are
some real problems or these people....

11:58.646 --> 12:01.006
You just said that. didn't you?

12:01.182 --> 12:04.282
You ought to wear a ski mask. skinhead.

12:04.452 --> 12:07.582
At least there's a reason
why my face looks like a fist.

12:08.523 --> 12:10.653
-Where did you find him. Bull?
-Cafeteria.

12:10.825 --> 12:13.585
He was standing next to
the soup of the day.

12:14.162 --> 12:16.152
He was in it.

12:16.731 --> 12:19.101
They found her. they found Ann.

12:19.267 --> 12:21.897
She's holed up
in the broom closet in the....

12:24.606 --> 12:27.296
I'm supposed to be hiding. aren't I?

12:27.475 --> 12:29.875
Doctor. they found the woman
hiding somewhere--

12:30.044 --> 12:31.774
DWORKIN:
I told them.

12:31.945 --> 12:34.405
Poor thing. she must be terrified.

12:34.581 --> 12:39.921
She'd probably be more terrified
if she didn't have that snub-nosed .38.

12:40.087 --> 12:42.557
I'd better get out there.

12:48.462 --> 12:51.022
Crazy day. huh?

12:52.332 --> 12:55.562
Ann. this is Harry Stone. the judge?

12:55.736 --> 12:58.226

that I'm not gonna hurt you...

12:58.405 --> 13:03.205
...and neither is anyone else.
but you've got to come out of there.

13:05.679 --> 13:09.009
All right. if you're not coming out.
then I'm coming in.

Nice place you got here.
I love what you've done to it.

13:32.539 --> 13:36.269
Hey. this room is so small. you'd have to
go outside to change your mind.

13:40.214 --> 13:42.654
Come on. I don't really care
if you don't wanna talk.

13:42.816 --> 13:45.216
Sometimes our tongues
just get us in trouble. right?

13:45.385 --> 13:47.545
Say something to someone.
they take it the wrong way...

13:47.720 --> 13:50.950
...and next thing you know. they're angry
or they're hurt or they're disappointed.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.153
I mean. pfft.

13:52.325 --> 13:56.015
I've said stuff. afterwards I wanted to rip
the tongue out my mouth. but I didn't do it.

13:56.194 --> 14:00.434
Because if you rip out your tongue.
then your food tastes awfully bland. right?

-You ever been institutionalized?

[LAUGHS]

14:33.832 --> 14:34.992
Why do you ask?

14:35.499 --> 14:38.199
People always ask me
do I play basketball.

14:39.103 --> 14:40.593
But you're tall.

14:40.771 --> 14:42.101
Uh-huh.

14:43.774 --> 14:47.714
Uh. I'll have you know. I'm a very.
very well-adjusted member of society.

14:47.878 --> 14:51.708
I happen to have a portfolio
that's worth over $75,000.

14:51.881 --> 14:54.781
I always heard
money couldn't buy happiness.

14:56.218 --> 14:58.378
That's sick. Wendell.

15:00.254 --> 15:03.594
Ann. I don't know what your problem is.
because you won't talk to me.

15:03.758 --> 15:05.848
And I don't know
why you won't talk to me.

15:06.027 --> 15:09.587
So I'm up the proverbial creek
without a paddle. aren't I?

15:10.898 --> 15:12.698
Well. there. that was communication.

15:12.867 --> 15:15.097
You acknowledged me
when you nodded just then.

15:15.269 --> 15:17.359
You did. You wanna try it again?

15:18.639 --> 15:21.469
Ann. do you wanna
go back to the hospital?

15:25.246 --> 15:27.766
No. Because everything's bad there?

15:31.052 --> 15:33.952
No? Some things are bad there?

15:37.992 --> 15:40.832
Ann. I think maybe we can help you
and your friends.

15:40.995 --> 15:44.685
I looked over this list. and most of these
demands seem totally justified to me.

15:44.864 --> 15:47.424
Except for the. uh.

15:47.600 --> 15:52.230

Come on. Ann. let's go.

15:58.845 --> 16:02.035
You know. I read somewhere once.

16:02.215 --> 16:05.005

and crowding up his sideshow tent...

16:05.185 --> 16:07.975

16:08.154 --> 16:10.124
"This way to the great egress!"

16:10.290 --> 16:14.520
And sure enough. the whole crowd
just flocked over. through to the egress...

16:14.694 --> 16:16.324
...which was the exit.

16:16.496 --> 16:18.726
Because that's what an egress is.
you get it?

16:19.232 --> 16:23.472
It's a door. Not unlike this one.

16:28.641 --> 16:30.201
Ann...

16:31.511 --> 16:36.451
...that embalming stuff.
that was Gilbert's idea. wasn't it?

Come on. This way to the great egress.

17:15.420 --> 17:16.720
In a sense.

17:16.887 --> 17:20.686
I've gone over this list and I feel these
people have made some legitimate points.

17:20.857 --> 17:24.347
Listen. buster. I happen to have
prominent connections in civil law.

17:24.528 --> 17:26.518
And I'd be willing to help your patients...

17:26.695 --> 17:30.926
...prepare a case to take you all the way
to the Supreme Court. if necessary.

17:35.205 --> 17:37.395
But you were saying?

17:38.442 --> 17:40.642
For example.
the right to open their own mail.

17:40.811 --> 17:44.511
Well. we feel it's important to monitor
their communications from the outside...

17:44.680 --> 17:47.710
...in case something should slip through
that might disturb them.

17:47.882 --> 17:50.582
Like current events.

17:52.619 --> 17:54.919
That's a very good example.
Mr. Dworkin.

17:55.655 --> 17:57.375

-Are you through. Your Honor?
-No. I'm not.

18:16.540 --> 18:21.140

the patients' best interests at heart...

18:36.260 --> 18:37.730
...you won't take me to court.

18:37.895 --> 18:39.355
-How do you figure that?
-Simple.

18:39.530 --> 18:41.900
-If they win. I'm out of business.
-Fine.

18:42.066 --> 18:44.226
Fine maybe for you
and your legal principles.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.600
-But what happens to them?
-Yeah. what?

18:47.770 --> 18:51.430
Chances are. they'll be put in an institution.
is that in their best interests?

18:51.608 --> 18:53.238
Oh. mercy.

18:53.409 --> 18:56.899
We'll be thrown in with the mentally ill.

Well. that's exactly what you're headed for
if we don't work something out.

19:02.151 --> 19:05.821
Well. forget it. doctor. because
they're not interested in making any deals.

19:05.989 --> 19:07.389
What kind of deal?

19:07.824 --> 19:10.234
We might talk about
extending television privileges.

19:10.393 --> 19:11.423
Absolutely not.

19:11.594 --> 19:15.664
The chance to watch a little extra TV
is not what's important here.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.362
-How much TV?
_No__

19:18.534 --> 19:21.304
-An extra hour a night.
-Weekends or weeknights?

How you're being manipulated?
