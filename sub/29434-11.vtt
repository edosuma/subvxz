through facial recognition, too.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.757
Maybe we'll get lucky.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.716
Yeah, do that.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.761
Sebastian and those guys
have been stopped

10:31.805 --> 10:35.373
at the same intersection
for a while now.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.332
What are they doing out there
in the middle of nowhere?

10:38.376 --> 10:40.335
Khoury.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.293
I need you and Gregorio
to get eyes on Sebastian.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.992
Right now.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.696
Damn it.
They must've thrown it out.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.437
Yeah, we'll find him.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.354
Where do you think
they took him?

10:59.397 --> 11:01.399
I don't know.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.403
[vehicle approaching]

11:16.414 --> 11:18.982
You didn't have to toss
the phone, you know.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.201
You could've just taken
the battery out.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.419
It's not like
it can be tracked.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.247
No phones allowed out here.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.510
Or I could've just left it
in my car, you know?

11:25.554 --> 11:27.512
Just saying.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.340
So, uh...

11:29.384 --> 11:31.081
what exactly are we doing here?

11:31.125 --> 11:33.170
You might want to stop
asking questions.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.869
They can be dangerous. Come on.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.914
[door creaks open]

11:50.753 --> 11:53.756
Appreciate you
coming out to meet me.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.453
I'm Jim Keene.

11:55.497 --> 11:58.282
Yeah, sure. No problem, Jim.

11:58.326 --> 11:59.936
Commander.

12:02.373 --> 12:03.897
You're the Commander?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.202
[chuckles softly]

12:05.246 --> 12:08.075
It is an honor to meet you, sir,

12:08.118 --> 12:09.424
There's no need for formalities.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.643
We're all brothers here.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.863
I heard that you shot a man
for the cause last night.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.169
Happy to do it,
sir. Commander.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.605
[chuckles]

12:16.648 --> 12:18.825
Abel tells me
that you know your way

12:18.868 --> 12:20.043
around crime scenes.Oh, yeah.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.436
Worked with the
Louisiana State Police

12:21.479 --> 12:22.872
as a CSI for seven years.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.178
I know.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.136
I looked you up.

12:27.529 --> 12:30.053
Heard you got
in a little trouble there.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.228
Well, now, that...

12:32.664 --> 12:34.623
That wasn't my fault, you know?

12:34.666 --> 12:36.973
Supervisor
had just been riding my ass,

12:37.017 --> 12:38.409
telling me what to do
all the time,

12:38.453 --> 12:40.368
and I kicked his
ass, you know?

12:40.411 --> 12:42.065
I don't know how I'm supposed
to take orders from someone

12:42.109 --> 12:45.025
who's not even born
in this country.That's right.

12:45.068 --> 12:49.029
This country is being infested
by unhealthy influences.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.379
It's up to men like us

12:51.422 --> 12:52.946
to start cleaning house.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.776
I'd like to be part of that.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.823
Good.
[laughs]

13:00.867 --> 13:03.260
Because meeting you
has come at an opportune time.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.741
Turns out we are in need
of your services.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.092
Like for you to help
make a little problem

13:09.136 --> 13:10.659
go away.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.115
Hey. Still no sign
of Sebastian?
Hey.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.421
Nothing yet.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.945
Hannah's with the sheriffs
doing a grid search.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.425
Well, I've been looking
through property records

13:37.468 --> 13:39.166
for any connections
to known members of the RAC,

13:39.209 --> 13:40.645
and there's nothing.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.125
Yeah, well,
we called in air support.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.040
They'll be able
to cover more ground.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.650
God, he could be anywhere,
Pride.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.304
Yeah. We'll find him.

13:47.348 --> 13:51.178
Sebastian got his decision
letter from REACT.
Oh?

13:51.221 --> 13:53.180
Cool.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.095
Um, does it make me
a terrible friend

13:55.138 --> 13:56.705
if I hope he doesn't get in?

13:59.012 --> 14:00.361
PATTON:
Hey, I'm glad
you back.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.145
Hey.I was just about to call you.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.886
Find something?
Yep.

14:03.930 --> 14:08.151
I may know who our mysterious
Commander of the RAC is.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.326
I spent last night
digging into all

14:09.370 --> 14:11.024
the members
that we've identified.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.503
Turns out, over half of them
are connected to this guy.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.637
James Keene.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.030
Former Army Ranger.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.859
Yeah, but he was
dishonorably discharged.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.773
Shot a member of his own unit
during an engagement.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.733
He claims it was an accident,
but no one believed him.

14:24.776 --> 14:25.995
Did he serve time?For manslaughter,
not for murder.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.736
He only did
three years.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.869
Looks like he's got
an outstanding warrant.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.783
PATTON:
He's wanted for bombing
a military warehouse

14:31.827 --> 14:33.960
in Little Rock
a year ago.[phone beeping]

14:34.003 --> 14:36.745
Three people died, and Keene's
been off the grid ever since.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.486
GREGORIO:
This guy Keene finds out
Sebastian's a cop,

14:38.529 --> 14:39.704
he'll kill him.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.229
Actually, Loretta says
Sebastian's fine.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.274
Well, how does she know that?

14:44.318 --> 14:46.450
WADE:
Because he left me a message.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.061
A very messy message.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.584
This morning, pieces of a body

14:49.627 --> 14:52.065
were discovered in
Jefferson Parish.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.371
So, of course, they found
their way to my table.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.938
Pieces?

14:55.982 --> 14:58.549
Dismembered, soaked
in sulfuric acid to destroy

14:58.593 --> 15:00.812
any distinguishing detail.What does this

15:00.856 --> 15:02.249
have to do with Sebastian?

15:02.292 --> 15:06.383
When I examined them,
I found this.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.912
That's one hell of a message.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.959
Baking powder neutralizes
sulfuric acid.

15:17.003 --> 15:22.095
Sebastian must have secretly
applied it to get my attention.

15:22.138 --> 15:26.926
How did the remains
make it to you so quickly?

15:26.969 --> 15:28.623
They were dumped outside
Lafitte National Park.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.929
It's an area

15:29.972 --> 15:32.801
that's patrolled by park rangers
every morning.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.934
Sebastian knew they'd find this.He took a
lot of risks

15:34.977 --> 15:37.110
to get this to us.Yeah.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.633
You able to ID the victim?

15:38.676 --> 15:40.852
Sebastian came through
on that front, too.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.247
The body parts were damaged
beyond recognition,

15:44.291 --> 15:49.992
except for one perfectly
preserved fingerprint.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.254
Byron Landis.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.083
He's got no criminal record,

15:54.127 --> 15:55.650
but he did pop up

15:55.693 --> 15:57.739
in a database
of state employees.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.045
Courthouse guard.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.916
Maybe he was a member
of the RAC?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.223
Maybe. But whoever he is,

16:03.266 --> 16:06.095
Sebastian thinks
that Landis is important.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.141
We need to figure out
how he's connected.

16:08.184 --> 16:12.188
And bring Sebastian home, soon.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.412
There's more grits if you want.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.196
Oh, no, thanks. I'm not hungry.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.852
[stifled laugh]
Grow a pair, man.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.201
I did all the chopping.
You just poured

16:25.245 --> 16:26.724
a little acid over it all.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.639
Looks like you're about
done there, Abel.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.256
Sure.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.260
Those grits were
delicious, Commander.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.394
Maybe you don't have the stomach
for this kind of work.

16:47.136 --> 16:50.270
[sighs]

16:51.445 --> 16:52.794
[laughs]

16:54.622 --> 16:56.450
I thought you were used
to handling dead bodies.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.756
Oh, no, it wasn't that.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.802
Then what's bothering you?

17:00.845 --> 17:04.545
That guy last night,
what'd he do?

17:04.588 --> 17:06.199
I offered him a chance
to help us and he refused.

17:08.114 --> 17:11.247
We're in a war here.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.770
And there...
[laughs]

17:12.814 --> 17:14.294
...there's gonna be casualties.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.255
Is that something
you can handle or not?

17:23.259 --> 17:26.001
Whole world's gone
to hell lately.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.788
We got to do whatever it takes
to make things right.

17:30.832 --> 17:31.920
Yes, we do.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.054
It's our duty.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.795
You know, I served
our military proudly.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.884
But they are turning
their backs on our kind,

17:39.928 --> 17:42.148
the very people
who built America.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.714
We just gonna take that?

17:43.758 --> 17:45.194
No way.Damn right.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.848
But the only way
they will pay attention

17:46.891 --> 17:49.459
is if they are forced to.

17:49.503 --> 17:52.071
[chuckles]:
Our military used to be

17:52.114 --> 17:56.075
respected and feared.

17:56.118 --> 18:00.296
Real American men willing
to die for their country.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.516
And now they just,

18:02.559 --> 18:04.866
they just let anybody in.

18:05.301 --> 18:10.524
Women, gays,
foreigners.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.266
The bottom of the barrel
from the worst neighborhoods.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.095
So what are we gonna do?

18:16.138 --> 18:17.400
Force them

18:17.444 --> 18:20.142
to face the error of their ways.

18:20.186 --> 18:25.756
But you are only useful to me
if you are truly committed.

18:28.150 --> 18:32.633
I killed one man
and I just got rid of another.

18:32.676 --> 18:36.027
How much more commitment
do you need?

18:37.072 --> 18:38.900
[laughs]

18:42.556 --> 18:43.992
Eat up, then.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.950
We've got a lot
of work to do today.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.213
Meet me out
front in ten.

18:47.256 --> 18:48.910
Yeah.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.964
[retches]

19:00.008 --> 19:02.010
[panting]

19:10.932 --> 19:12.934
[sniffles]

19:16.285 --> 19:18.244
When we find Sebastian,
I'm gonna kick his ass.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.246
He should've pulled out
when I told him to.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.552
He made a tactical decision,
just the same way you would've.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.294
It-it's like he's looking
for ways to play with fire.

19:25.338 --> 19:28.558
This whole going undercover
and REACT thing, it's...

19:28.602 --> 19:30.821
Sebastian is...

19:30.865 --> 19:33.607
He's growing,
as an agent, as a person.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.870
Oh, God...Look, I get it.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.046
You worry. So do I.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.048
Same way I worried for Laurel

19:40.091 --> 19:41.832
when she wanted
to go off to New York.

19:41.876 --> 19:45.575
But I knew, if I held her back,
she'd just resent me.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.667
Hey, so I talked
to Byron Landis's old boss

19:50.711 --> 19:51.929
at the courthouse.

19:51.973 --> 19:54.280
He retired, full benefits.

19:54.323 --> 19:55.716
Never any
trouble there.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.500
He has no ties to white
nationalist groups, either.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.633
Okay. So what's his connection
to the RAC?

19:59.676 --> 20:01.417
Uh, he's been working
ever since he retired.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.245
Part-time security work.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.595
Yeah? Anywhere interesting?

20:05.639 --> 20:08.294
PATTON:
A food manufacturing
company in Elmwood.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.687
Tried to reach out to them,
they don't open on Saturdays.

20:10.731 --> 20:12.863
Can you get the number
of the owner?Yeah.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.476
Who's that?

20:16.519 --> 20:18.478
PATTON:
Oh, that's a little something
I was doing for Pride.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.828
I don't recognize him.
Is that a case?

20:20.871 --> 20:23.918
That's just a little favor.

20:24.962 --> 20:27.182
Okay.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.272
Look, whatever it is,
I just hope that...

20:30.316 --> 20:31.752
that Pride's talking
to you about it.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.189
Because he... thinks
he's hiding it well,

20:34.233 --> 20:36.235
but it's really clear
that he's struggling.

20:36.278 --> 20:39.368
[sighs] It's been
a tough year for all of us.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.545
Yeah.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.157
Here you go.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.681
The cell phone number

20:47.724 --> 20:49.422
to the owner of the
manufacturing company.

20:49.465 --> 20:51.380
[phone dialing]

20:56.603 --> 20:58.344
That's a lot of nitrogen.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.346
Remember what I said
about questions?

21:00.389 --> 21:02.391
Technically, that was
more of a statement.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.482
I just don't know
what else we have to do

21:06.526 --> 21:08.092
to get this guy to trust us.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.355
Commander's careful.

21:09.398 --> 21:11.270
Maybe even
a little paranoid.

21:11.313 --> 21:12.880
He only tells us
what we need to know.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.361
Whatever.

21:15.404 --> 21:16.710
Just don't see how we're
supposed to carry out

21:16.753 --> 21:18.799
this big plan if nobody
knows what's going on.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.235
Don't worry
about it, man.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.976
I'm sure he'll
fill us in tomorrow.

21:22.019 --> 21:24.283
Whatever it is,
it's gonna be epic.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.241
ABEL:
He asking
more questions?

21:27.503 --> 21:29.288
Nah...

21:29.331 --> 21:31.202
just making
statements.

21:31.246 --> 21:34.075
Excited to know
what's going down, right?Absolutely.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.297
You two take off.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.385
We'll load the rest.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.256
You're with me.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.696
Abel, we got company!

21:46.740 --> 21:50.091
I see Sebastian.
We got to get him, Pride!Hold on.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.135
Go, get out of here!

21:54.400 --> 21:55.923
Let's go inside,
there's more cover, come on!

21:55.966 --> 21:58.142
Come on!Okay, okay! Go! Go!

21:59.056 --> 22:00.319
NCIS! Drop your weapon!

22:05.411 --> 22:07.848
Secure him!
Then cover the front!

22:24.952 --> 22:27.389
SEBASTIAN:
Pride.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.436
Where's Brooks?He's on the far side, we're
supposed to be surrounding you.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.568
Okay. All right, look.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.353
Let's split up.
We'll take him down.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.789
No, no. We-we can't, okay?
I mean, I-I can't.

22:35.832 --> 22:36.964
I can't break my cover.

22:37.007 --> 22:38.226
This thing,
that's happening tomorrow,

22:38.269 --> 22:39.401
they're gonna kill people.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.533
Yeah, but we have them now.

22:40.576 --> 22:41.751
We can stop it.But that's the thing,

22:41.795 --> 22:42.970
I don't know where
it's happening, okay?

22:43.013 --> 22:44.711
None of these guys do,
but they trust me now.

22:44.754 --> 22:47.409
All right? So if I stay with
them for a little bit longer...

22:47.453 --> 22:49.237
[grunts]What are you doing?

22:52.458 --> 22:53.589
Hit me, Sebastian.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.984
[grunts]
You have to do better than that.

23:00.988 --> 23:03.686
Finish him off!No, wait! We got to go!
Come on! There's gonna be more!

23:10.432 --> 23:12.478
[phone beeps]

23:12.521 --> 23:14.915
Gregorio...

23:14.958 --> 23:16.438
they're coming out,
don't stop them.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.135
We got to let them go.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.538
Ahh.
Okay...

23:29.582 --> 23:31.758
Sebastian certainly
didn't pull his punch.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.629
Eh, that's my fault.
I told him not to.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.066
Yeah, you should've got
him out of there, Dwayne.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.373
Well, it was his call,
and he made the right one.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.897
Makes me sad to think
of him with those people.

23:40.941 --> 23:44.597
The hateful things
he'll have to say or do.Uh-huh.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.555
Hopefully by tomorrow
it'll be over,

23:46.599 --> 23:49.079
and he'll be home.Yeah, but what
will it cost him?

23:50.385 --> 23:52.561
Right now, though,
I'm concerned about you.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.433
This might be an
orbital fracture.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.957
What?Follow this for me.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.142
Something wrong, Dwayne?

24:10.187 --> 24:11.711
What-- What?

24:12.842 --> 24:16.106
Nah, just a, a bad memory.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.368
It's nothing.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.153
Didn't look
like nothing.

24:19.196 --> 24:20.894
No, I-I'm okay, Loretta, thanks.

24:20.937 --> 24:23.723
Uh, uh, I-I shouldn't
keep you.

24:23.766 --> 24:26.421
Hoping you can find something

24:26.465 --> 24:29.598
on the body, give us some clue

24:29.642 --> 24:32.035
so we can stop this thing
before it gets started.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.602
Of course.

24:33.646 --> 24:36.431
Now you call me if that pain
doesn't go away in a few hours.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.438
He screwed it up
somehow!

24:43.482 --> 24:44.613
The cops must've
identified the body,

24:44.657 --> 24:46.180
figured out
where he works.
You don't

24:46.223 --> 24:47.964
know that. Someone could've
seen us and called it in.

24:48.008 --> 24:50.227
You had one job...And I did it.

24:50.271 --> 24:52.142
Don't look at me 'cause
your operation fell apart.

24:52.186 --> 24:53.361
You're blaming me
for this?

24:53.404 --> 24:56.016
Enough.
I never
trusted him...

24:56.059 --> 24:57.452
I said enough!

24:57.496 --> 24:59.454
We don't turn
on each other.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.977
That's what they want.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.806
Makes it easier for them
to take what should be ours.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.026
You should've let me
kill that cop.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.636
Yeah, then every cop
in the state

25:07.680 --> 25:09.508
would be
looking for us.The only fact that matters

25:09.551 --> 25:11.031
right now is
we are one man down.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.467
A man that we needed

25:12.511 --> 25:14.904
for tomorrow's mission.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.906
Are you good
with a rifle?

25:16.950 --> 25:18.299
Yeah, I'm all right, I guess.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.475
You told us you qualified
at sharpshooter level.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.824
That a lie?

25:21.868 --> 25:24.044
No. I just don't know
if I want to be

25:24.087 --> 25:25.872
a part of something
if no one's gonna trust me.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.351
KEENE:
I wouldn't be asking you

25:27.395 --> 25:29.310
if I didn't trust you.

25:29.353 --> 25:32.966
Tomorrow, the
Corps needs you.

25:33.009 --> 25:35.751
Will you join us?

25:38.537 --> 25:41.409
Of course. It's time
to show people

25:41.452 --> 25:43.672
who this country
really belongs to.Damn right.

25:43.716 --> 25:46.414
Now get some rest. Both of you.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.681
You may have themfooled,
but not me.

26:02.473 --> 26:05.955
HANNAH:
The RAC seems to target
disgruntled military

26:05.999 --> 26:08.654
and law enforcement.Keene finds men
like himself.

26:08.697 --> 26:11.613
Did you get an ID on that guy?Yeah, Todd Solloway.

26:11.657 --> 26:15.399
He did a couple of tours
as a military scout sniper,

26:15.443 --> 26:17.314
got an ODPMC
discharge.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.490
Mental issues?

26:19.534 --> 26:21.101
He fought it, but lost.

26:21.144 --> 26:23.277
The fact that one of their most
trusted guys was a sniper

26:23.320 --> 26:24.800
is troubling.Well, I've been trying
to figure out

26:24.844 --> 26:26.628
out who their target might be.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.065
The only thing stolen from
that warehouse were tanks

26:29.109 --> 26:30.589
full of nitrogen.

26:30.632 --> 26:34.462
Well, Petty Officer Teagan
was an aviation mechanic.

26:34.505 --> 26:35.768
Nitrogen is used

26:35.811 --> 26:38.553
extensively in
airplane fuel lines.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.468
You think Keene tried to get
the nitrogen from him first?

26:40.511 --> 26:42.644
GREGORIO:
Maybe because
he refused,

26:42.688 --> 26:44.820
they went after
the security guard.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.344
But why?
Nitrogen's incredibly stable.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.564
You can't use it
as an explosive.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.653
[beeping]It's Doc Wade,

26:51.697 --> 26:53.263
maybe she found
something.

26:53.307 --> 26:54.700
Hey, Doc.WADE: Hey.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.223
Any word from Sebastian?

26:56.266 --> 26:57.790
Nothing yet. We'll let you know
the minute we hear.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.008
Loretta,
you find something?

26:59.052 --> 27:01.576
Yes. A match to
the partial print we found

27:01.620 --> 27:04.361
on our Navy mechanic victim
a couple weeks ago.

27:04.405 --> 27:06.494
Wait, I thought that
partial wasn't enough to ID?

27:06.537 --> 27:09.889
It wasn't. Until the killer
ended up on my table.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.456
The print matches Todd Solloway.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.110
HANNAH:
That makes sense.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.895
He's one of the guys
Keene trusted most.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.767
Anything that might help
us find where they are?

27:18.811 --> 27:20.421
Nothing very useful, I'm afraid.

27:20.464 --> 27:24.207
Though Mr. Solloway
did have an unusual meal

27:24.251 --> 27:25.339
before he was killed.

27:25.382 --> 27:27.428
How unusual?

27:27.471 --> 27:30.823
Rattlesnake
and jalapeño sausage.

27:30.866 --> 27:33.695
Can't be too many places
in the city you can get that.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.002
GREGORIO:
We'll take any lead we
can get at this point, Doc.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.613
Sebastian's running
out of time.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.489
All right, men, listen up.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.579
To get the military to wake up,
we need to make an impression.

27:48.623 --> 27:50.930
We're gonna blow something up
with nitrogen, aren't we?

27:50.973 --> 27:52.714
SEBASTIAN:
No, we can't.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.411
I'm just saying
nitrogen isn't combustible.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.631
It won't blow...
we literally can't.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.024
Very astute.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.373
He's right.

27:59.416 --> 28:00.679
No explosions today.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.724
So what are doing?

28:02.768 --> 28:04.247
Thing about nitrogen is,

28:04.291 --> 28:06.641
it can suck the oxygen
right out of the air.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.164
You could kill people
without them even knowing

28:08.208 --> 28:09.383
they're in danger.That's right,

28:09.426 --> 28:10.732
over a hundred if we're lucky.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.386
Just tell us what to do.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.475
You two are together.
Take the rifles.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.869
Solloway scouted
the site yesterday,

28:16.912 --> 28:20.263
found a good sniper's nest.
Get up there,

28:20.307 --> 28:21.961
when I give the signal,
you start shooting.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.223
What about
the nitrogen?

28:24.311 --> 28:25.834
You two are just
getting things rolling.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.314
We'll all be on comms,

28:27.357 --> 28:28.576
when everybody
starts running

28:28.619 --> 28:30.056
the three of us
will take care of the rest.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.579
And men...

28:31.622 --> 28:33.755
if anything goes sideways
out there,

28:33.799 --> 28:36.366
we do not go down
without a fight.

28:36.410 --> 28:37.977
You start shooting,

28:38.020 --> 28:40.066
and you kill as many
of those vermin

28:40.109 --> 28:41.894
as you possibly can.

28:41.937 --> 28:45.332
One way or another,
we will get our message across.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.950
ABEL:
You look
a little nervous there.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.432
Come on.
We got work to do.

29:08.529 --> 29:11.837
Patton's scanning street cams
for the plates of either

29:11.880 --> 29:14.448
of those trucks.Yeah, BOLOs are out for
all known RAC members.

29:14.491 --> 29:15.841
Including Sebastian.

29:15.884 --> 29:17.494
Yeah. We need to figure
out their target

29:17.538 --> 29:19.670
before he's forced
to compromise his cover.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.672
If he does that,
he's gonna get himself killed.

29:21.716 --> 29:22.804
I may have something.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.719
So there's
only one place in town

29:24.763 --> 29:26.677
that makes rattlesnake
jalapeño sausage.

29:26.721 --> 29:29.071
Well, at least we know oneplace
the sniper visited.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.507
Not exactly.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.814
It's made locally,
but it's served

29:32.858 --> 29:34.294
on a food truck.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.470
HANNAH:
First of the Wurst?

29:36.513 --> 29:37.819
Clever and popular.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.516
Stops at
several locations

29:39.560 --> 29:41.692
each day. I was able
to get a route map,

29:41.736 --> 29:43.085
but it didn't narrow
things down much.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.174
Actually, it might.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.741
I've been putting together
a list of targets

29:46.785 --> 29:48.308
the RAC might hit.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.310
So one of those locations
means something to you?

29:50.353 --> 29:51.746
Yeah, maybe.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.704
A contact at Homeland
sent me everything they have

29:53.748 --> 29:55.968
on James Keene.[beeping]

29:56.011 --> 29:58.492
This is a manifesto he wrote
a few years ago.

29:58.535 --> 30:00.276
He doesn't like
the military, right?

30:00.320 --> 30:03.279
Well, he claims that he's
fighting forthe military,

30:03.323 --> 30:04.977
which he believes is being
destroyed by recruiting

30:05.020 --> 30:06.630
"foreign influences."

30:06.674 --> 30:08.197
Who does that include?

30:08.241 --> 30:09.677
According to Keene,

30:09.720 --> 30:12.680
anyone who's not
a straight Caucasian male.

30:12.723 --> 30:15.422
This is one of
the potential targets

30:15.465 --> 30:17.598
I identified.

30:17.641 --> 30:18.860
Military recruitment fair.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.470
Cormier College.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.037
That's one of
the food truck stops.Mm-hmm.

30:22.081 --> 30:24.083
Maybe the sniper was there
scouting the place?

30:24.126 --> 30:26.085
Best lead we got.
Let's check it out.

30:30.611 --> 30:33.396
[indistinct chatter]

30:38.575 --> 30:41.100
Which way?
Far side.

30:41.143 --> 30:42.666
I don't see the
Commander or the others.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.843
Shut up and stop looking around.
You'll draw attention.

30:50.631 --> 30:51.501
ABEL:
Hey!

30:52.589 --> 30:53.634
Come on!

30:56.550 --> 30:59.553
There's a lot of people here.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.163
GREGORIO:
If these RAC guys
are here and panic,

31:01.207 --> 31:02.338
they could start shooting.

31:02.382 --> 31:03.470
Yeah, we need
to keep a low profile.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.472
It's mostly
college kids, though.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.430
Might be kind of hard
to blend in.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.564
PRIDE:
Actually...

31:10.607 --> 31:13.045
I don't think that's gonna be
a problem. Hats and jackets.

31:13.088 --> 31:16.222
Let's communicate if we spot
any RAC members.

31:16.265 --> 31:17.614
Let's identify as many

31:17.658 --> 31:20.182
as possible
before we make a move.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.069
SEBASTIAN:
So we shoot...

31:37.112 --> 31:39.767
everyone down there panics
and runs for safety.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.725
Like the cowards they are.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.690
SEBASTIAN:
That building is the most
logical place for shelter.

31:59.134 --> 32:01.006
I still can't figure out why
they stole that nitrogen.

32:01.049 --> 32:03.834
The reason they use nitrogen
in food processing

32:03.878 --> 32:06.837
is to suck out
all the oxygen, right?

32:06.881 --> 32:09.362
GREGORIO [over comm]:
Maybe they don't plan
to use it out here.

32:17.457 --> 32:19.589
Here.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.987
Commander, we're in position.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.554
KEENE:
Wait for my signal.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.948
[exhales] Let's do this.

32:31.210 --> 32:34.169
Don't even think about
backing out now.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.518
I'm not.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.825
I was right about you, wasn't I?

32:37.868 --> 32:40.175
I told the Commander you've been
hiding things from us.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.614
That you're not who
you pretend to be.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.705
What, exactly, did you tell him?

32:48.749 --> 32:51.447
That I've known plenty like you.

32:51.491 --> 32:53.841
Guys who try to act
like they belong.

32:53.884 --> 32:56.757
But the truth is,
you're not willing to do

32:56.800 --> 32:59.238
what's needed to be done
to change things.

32:59.281 --> 33:02.458
You can't handle
the real work.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.156
That's what you think
I'm hiding?

33:04.199 --> 33:05.635
That I'm not as tough as you?

33:05.679 --> 33:07.811
Now get into position...

33:10.945 --> 33:12.120
Man, that felt good.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.653
[phone ringing]

33:30.704 --> 33:32.749
PRIDE:
Hang on.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.360
Got one in front
of the building.

33:34.403 --> 33:35.796
Fatigues.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.058
HANNAH:
Quad looks clear.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.842
I'm heading to you.

33:38.886 --> 33:41.323
[phone ringing]

33:41.367 --> 33:42.890
Pride.

33:42.933 --> 33:44.892
Pride, thank God.
Listen, it's the building, okay?

33:44.935 --> 33:46.241
Keene's gonna suffocate everyone

33:46.285 --> 33:47.329
by herding them inside.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.331
Sebastian, where are you?

33:49.375 --> 33:50.854
I'm on the rooftop
across from the quad.

33:50.898 --> 33:53.727
KEENE [over comm]:
And we're go
in three, two, one.

33:53.770 --> 33:54.858
It's happening now.

33:54.902 --> 33:57.687
KEENE:
What's happening? Brooks, fire.

33:57.731 --> 34:00.125
Keep everyone out
of that building.

34:00.168 --> 34:02.083
KEENE:
Bryce, get those people moving.

34:10.700 --> 34:12.441
[panicked shouting]

34:12.485 --> 34:15.053
Everybody in here!
You'll be safe!

34:15.096 --> 34:16.445
No! Stay where you are!

34:21.668 --> 34:23.365
No, no, no, no.
Not this way.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.410
Wait!SOLDIER: Hurry!

34:26.325 --> 34:28.370
Gregorio, seal off the building.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.677
Everyone's running right
into a kill zone.

34:39.251 --> 34:40.469
Come on, everybody inside!

34:40.513 --> 34:42.602
Stop!Don't go in the building.

34:42.645 --> 34:43.690
Everybody in here!
You'll be safe!

34:43.733 --> 34:46.127
No, do not go inside.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.911
Put your hands where
I can see 'em, now!

34:47.955 --> 34:49.783
Don't.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.698
I got him. Go get Keene.

34:51.741 --> 34:52.699
Put 'em up, now!

34:54.483 --> 34:56.485
[air hissing][people coughing, gasping]

34:57.921 --> 34:59.532
[alarm blaring]Get out. Get out!

35:01.229 --> 35:03.971
Tell everybody to stay outside.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.769
Outside. Go outside.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.033
Keene!

35:24.600 --> 35:26.820
Hands behind your head.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.142
[exhales]

35:44.185 --> 35:46.013
[alarm blaring]

35:55.892 --> 35:57.807
Hey. You guys all right?

35:57.851 --> 36:00.375
Yeah. Yeah, paramedics
are helping the victims.

36:00.419 --> 36:01.376
Everyone's reviving.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.900
Keene's dead.

36:03.944 --> 36:04.988
How are you, Sebastian?

36:05.032 --> 36:06.773
Oh, I'm just glad
it's over, you know.

36:06.816 --> 36:07.817
I really need a shower.

36:07.861 --> 36:09.428
You're gonna burn in hell.

36:09.471 --> 36:10.733
You're a traitor
to your race!

36:10.777 --> 36:12.866
Shut up.You're a traitor
to your species.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.172
Am I right?

36:17.784 --> 36:20.482
She mad at me for something?

36:22.223 --> 36:25.139
I-I think she's just glad
to have you back.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.284
Still working on that report?

36:39.327 --> 36:42.374
Yeah, I'm just trying
to finish it.

36:45.290 --> 36:46.813
Hey, I'm--

36:46.856 --> 36:48.423
I'm sorry again
about your eye.

36:48.467 --> 36:49.859
I should have pulled
that punch.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.687
You were just following orders.

36:51.731 --> 36:55.256
You do have a hell
of a right cross, though.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.780
Well, you know.
[chuckles]

36:57.824 --> 37:00.957
You should head home.

37:01.001 --> 37:03.221
There's no hurry
on that report.Honestly...

37:03.264 --> 37:05.353
I just-- I want to be
done with this.

37:05.397 --> 37:06.876
I want to get it
out of my head.

37:06.920 --> 37:10.750
Never easy trying to
be something you're not.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.143
I guess I just,
I don't understand why

37:13.187 --> 37:15.711
anyone would want
to live that way.

37:15.755 --> 37:20.586
It's not something I've ever
fully understood myself.

37:20.629 --> 37:23.763
I've always felt differences
should be celebrated,

37:23.806 --> 37:25.765
not condemned.

37:25.808 --> 37:28.724
You should get
some rest, Sebastian.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.857
I will. I've just got to

37:30.900 --> 37:33.076
purge the last two weeks.[laughs]
Okay.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.904
Oh, hey, did you happen to see

37:34.948 --> 37:37.124
if, um, my REACT
decision letter came in?

37:37.167 --> 37:38.952
It should have come by now.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.910
Wasn't on your desk?

37:40.954 --> 37:42.956
No.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.918
You might want to check
with your roommate about that.

37:55.403 --> 37:57.449
[chuckles]

38:12.159 --> 38:16.424
Whoa! Man, you about to
give me a heart attack.

38:16.468 --> 38:18.905
Please don't sneak up
on me like that.

38:18.948 --> 38:21.255
Sorry.

38:23.736 --> 38:26.826
You're not still fooling
with that, are you?

38:26.869 --> 38:29.524
Yeah, well, facial recognition
was a bust, so I figured

38:29.568 --> 38:31.396
I'd just go through
these old case files

38:31.439 --> 38:34.399
and see if your nightmare buddy
is connected to any.

38:34.442 --> 38:36.226
Don't worry about it.

38:36.270 --> 38:40.405
Sorry, I... I sh-shouldn't
have wasted your time.Oh, come on, man.

38:40.448 --> 38:41.754
I love a good mystery.

38:41.797 --> 38:44.234
Just a bad dream.
There's nothing more to it.

38:44.278 --> 38:46.236
There's got to be something.
We just keep digging,

38:46.280 --> 38:47.977
we'll figure it out.Just let it go!

38:49.152 --> 38:51.764
Okay?

38:51.807 --> 38:53.853
Okay.

38:53.896 --> 38:55.985
If that's what you want, Pride.

38:58.292 --> 39:00.338
Just...

39:00.381 --> 39:01.774
Appreciate your efforts.

39:03.471 --> 39:04.994
Good night.

39:09.869 --> 39:10.696
SEBASTIAN:
Hey!

39:10.739 --> 39:12.306
GREGORIO:
Hey!

39:12.350 --> 39:13.655
Is that your sauce
I smell?

39:13.699 --> 39:15.265
Yes, it is.

39:15.309 --> 39:18.486
A little surprise for you.
Figured you deserved it.

39:18.530 --> 39:19.705
Oh, great. Thanks.

39:19.748 --> 39:21.489
You're welcome.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.317
Oh, hang on.

39:25.537 --> 39:28.670
What? What's up?

39:28.714 --> 39:31.107
Nothing. I just--

39:31.151 --> 39:32.500
Seemed like you were mad at me.

39:32.544 --> 39:35.111
Why would I be mad at you?

39:35.155 --> 39:36.504
Well, you don't always
need a reason.

39:38.767 --> 39:42.205
Well, maybe I was a little
mad at you, but,

39:42.249 --> 39:44.599
we're all good now.

39:45.339 --> 39:46.732
Okay, great.

39:46.775 --> 39:48.516
Mm-hmm.

39:51.476 --> 39:55.001
Uh, Pride suggested
that I ask you about

39:55.044 --> 39:56.655
my decision letter
from REACT.

39:56.698 --> 39:58.221
Have you seen that at all?

39:58.265 --> 40:00.398
Have I seen that?

40:00.441 --> 40:02.530
Maybe.
Where did I see it?

40:02.574 --> 40:04.184
Oh, maybe this is it
right here.

40:07.622 --> 40:10.103
It's been opened.I know I crossed the line,

40:10.146 --> 40:11.321
but I didn't read it.

40:11.365 --> 40:12.671
Would you admit it
if you did?
Look,

40:12.714 --> 40:14.673
you know how much
I worry about you, right?

40:14.716 --> 40:16.979
And you wanting to do
all these dangerous things,

40:17.023 --> 40:19.591
like going undercover
and REACT...

40:19.634 --> 40:20.548
It's just Crazy Town.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.855
I know.

40:25.161 --> 40:26.598
Then I realized that
you're ready for it.

40:28.295 --> 40:30.428
And even though
I don't like it, I...

40:30.471 --> 40:33.169
have to deal with it, so...

40:33.213 --> 40:35.389
Well, thank you.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.739
You're welcome.

40:37.783 --> 40:39.262
You totally read this,
though, didn't you?

40:39.306 --> 40:41.439
I swear to God,
I didn't read it.

40:41.482 --> 40:42.614
Open the damn letter.

40:42.657 --> 40:44.790
Open it up already. Come on.All right.

40:50.535 --> 40:51.623
Well?

40:51.666 --> 40:53.886
What is it?
Yes? No? What?

40:56.062 --> 40:57.063
Yeah.

40:57.106 --> 40:58.804
Yeah? You got in?

40:58.847 --> 41:00.414
I made it.
Yeah, you nut case!

41:00.458 --> 41:03.112
Yeah! Good job!

41:06.855 --> 41:08.770
What, did you not do one dish
while I was gone?

41:08.814 --> 41:10.642
You want this sauce
on the plate or on your head?

41:10.685 --> 41:12.731
Why are there Froot Loops
in a frying pan?

41:12.774 --> 41:13.993
I just cooked you a whole meal.Also, I made this

41:14.036 --> 41:15.734
in third grade...Now I'm done. Good night!
