WEBVTT

00:01.859 --> 00:04.559
The Jew's job application.

00:04.603 --> 00:07.163
All the information to give me
a starting point over there.

00:08.236 --> 00:10.656
There's no shame
in surviving, love.

00:10.697 --> 00:12.537
It's how I survived.

00:13.817 --> 00:15.977
I used my body.

00:17.217 --> 00:18.576
They used it.

00:18.577 --> 00:20.696
I've come to talk about
our daughter.

00:20.697 --> 00:23.176
Who is she?
Anna.

00:23.177 --> 00:25.136
I'm planning to propose.

00:25.137 --> 00:26.896
The answer will be no.

00:26.897 --> 00:29.536
You've made me believe in you.
Really?

00:29.537 --> 00:30.696
You're engaged.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.017
You think I'm going to let
some wop farm boy have her?

00:35.777 --> 00:39.576
The procedure is called
a transorbital lobotomy.

00:39.577 --> 00:42.896
It has proven 100% effective
in cases such as yours.

00:42.897 --> 00:47.256
How did it go with Dr Stewart?
The referral wasn't for me.

00:47.257 --> 00:50.777
George, I'm sorry, I think I've made
a terrible mistake.

01:18.857 --> 01:21.217
James said
he wanted someone for Olivia.

01:21.242 --> 01:24.241
If I'd have known what it was for I
never would have suggested Stewart.

01:24.242 --> 01:28.281
The man's got a good reputation.
On women's issues!

01:28.282 --> 01:30.481
But he brings a certain cruelty
to men like James.

01:30.482 --> 01:32.001
Now with Milson involved...

01:32.002 --> 01:33.481
Sorry, is James
undergoing treatment?

01:33.482 --> 01:34.961
Of his own volition.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.681
I know two men
who were under Milson's care.

01:37.682 --> 01:40.241
Neither were healed, both are
damaged and I've heard of others.

01:40.242 --> 01:42.801
He never said it would be easy.
There is no cure, George!

01:42.802 --> 01:45.962
Can we talk? Outside.

01:56.842 --> 01:59.561
You can't dismiss what she's
saying.

01:59.562 --> 02:01.961
Of course she's against it!
You have to at least see him.

02:01.962 --> 02:03.801
There's nothing wrong with James
in her bohemian circles.

02:03.802 --> 02:05.441
Do you know
what's being done to him?

02:05.442 --> 02:06.921
Milson has assured me...
Do you know?

02:06.922 --> 02:10.281
No.
I have a fair idea.

02:10.282 --> 02:13.281
James is up to it.
Her pansy friends weren't.

02:13.282 --> 02:14.921
It's as simple as that.
Don't!

02:14.922 --> 02:16.921
Please...

02:16.922 --> 02:20.441
No father could be happy
learning his son is like that.

02:20.442 --> 02:23.042
No father should let his child
be tortured.

02:25.322 --> 02:28.442
Milson said family concern
would hamper his progress.

02:30.762 --> 02:32.562
I'm simply asking you to see him.

02:45.362 --> 02:48.281
They told me not to visit him.

02:48.282 --> 02:50.801
I should have stood my ground!

02:50.802 --> 02:52.802
Try to be strong. For James.

02:53.802 --> 02:55.641
I'm worried George
may be talked around.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.322
That's why I'm going.

03:01.002 --> 03:02.322
All set.

03:03.522 --> 03:05.361
Keep an open mind.

03:05.362 --> 03:07.162
Of course I will.

03:10.202 --> 03:13.561
I'll need some time alone with James.
It may not be possible.

03:13.562 --> 03:15.762
We have to make sure it is.

03:19.522 --> 03:21.122
Please.

03:23.922 --> 03:25.442
Please.

03:28.322 --> 03:31.922
Whatever it takes
to get to the truth.

03:35.282 --> 03:38.041
Listen to me carefully, James.

03:38.042 --> 03:39.201
Yes.

03:39.202 --> 03:43.121
Your family insist on seeing you,
so I'm relying on your strength.

03:43.122 --> 03:45.561
Now answer me this.

03:45.562 --> 03:50.122
Do you wish to see that look of utter
disgust on your father's face again?

03:52.002 --> 03:53.842
No.

03:54.962 --> 03:58.762
Then make him proud of the real man
we're making of you, yes?

04:04.242 --> 04:06.642
Yes.
Good.

04:07.722 --> 04:09.642
Now, just a mild sedative.

04:19.281 --> 04:22.362
There. Get rid of this,
then bring them down.

04:41.402 --> 04:43.121
I'm off.

04:43.122 --> 04:45.841
Shopping.
Oh, in this heat?

04:45.842 --> 04:48.441
A necessary evil this time of year.

04:48.442 --> 04:50.601
You still have a few days' grace.

04:50.602 --> 04:52.641
Not if I want a certain somebody
in the country

04:52.642 --> 04:54.201
to receive something in time.

04:54.202 --> 04:56.042
You surprise me.

04:57.042 --> 04:59.041
You impress me.

04:59.042 --> 05:01.561
Your determination to persevere
with my granddaughter,

05:01.562 --> 05:03.161
despite her behaviour.

05:03.162 --> 05:06.922
I'm no stranger to wild oats. I'd be
a hypocrite to begrudge Anna hers.

05:08.242 --> 05:09.881
I was thinking,

05:09.882 --> 05:12.562
a gift in the hand
is better than two in the post.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.881
Father's antics do rather rule out
a Merry Christmas here.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.002
You'd like to visit.

05:21.922 --> 05:25.402
No battle can be won
from a distance.

05:27.762 --> 05:30.162
A country Christmas it is, then.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.321
I wish you could stay.

05:33.322 --> 05:36.921
"You engaged, Miss Anna.
Now you live here? Scandalo!"

05:36.922 --> 05:39.801
When's he going to call me Anna?
Probably never.

05:39.802 --> 05:42.201
I should take this off
in case we run into someone.

05:42.202 --> 05:44.201
Here.

05:44.202 --> 05:47.801
I want it announced properly.
In the paper.

05:47.802 --> 05:50.921
Mr George Bligh is proud to announce

05:50.922 --> 05:54.962
the engagement of his daughter Anna
to Gino Poletti.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.522
Then this will be
on your finger forever.

05:59.602 --> 06:00.602
Forever.

06:12.082 --> 06:14.082
No telling.

06:16.202 --> 06:20.682
Dr Duncan. Gilda must be the most
visited patient you've got.

06:23.042 --> 06:26.601
Guess what.
I'm making it easier for you.

06:26.602 --> 06:28.081
Making what easier?

06:28.082 --> 06:31.762
I'm moving home, so you can visit me
and Aunty Carolyn at the same time.

06:32.562 --> 06:36.601
I saw you at the party. Of course
you're interested. Who wouldn't be?

06:36.602 --> 06:38.842
You'd make a nice new uncle.

06:40.042 --> 06:41.881
Anna.

06:41.882 --> 06:43.562
I'm...

06:46.962 --> 06:49.722
Don't worry, I'll put in
a good word for you.

06:58.122 --> 07:00.321
Doctor. My fiancee, Miss Adams.

07:00.322 --> 07:01.921
Miss Adams. My congratulations.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.521
Oh, thank you.
Mrs Bligh.

07:03.522 --> 07:05.241
How is he?
He's doing well.

07:05.242 --> 07:06.962
Very keen to reassure you.

07:09.922 --> 07:11.761
Oh, my darling!

07:11.762 --> 07:13.722
Let's show him some strength,
shall we?

07:14.802 --> 07:17.201
James. How are you, son?

07:17.202 --> 07:20.401
He may be a little slow to respond.

07:20.402 --> 07:21.881
A mild sedation.

07:21.882 --> 07:24.201
Is that necessary?

07:24.202 --> 07:26.361
We keep him as comfortable
as possible.

07:26.362 --> 07:29.402
Don't we, James? Hm?
Look who's here.

07:30.802 --> 07:33.242
Look at your wife.
Positively glowing.

07:35.202 --> 07:38.842
So... big.

07:40.642 --> 07:43.641
It's two weeks since you've seen me.

07:43.642 --> 07:45.802
Yes.

07:46.562 --> 07:48.481
How are you finding things, James?

07:48.482 --> 07:51.041
We're very pleased
with his progress.

07:51.042 --> 07:53.361
They're not being too rough on you?

07:53.362 --> 07:55.601
I'd rather you didn't discuss
his treatment.

07:55.602 --> 07:59.001
Certainly not ask him
to make value judgements on it.

07:59.002 --> 08:00.881
I see.

08:00.882 --> 08:02.681
This is the very reason
we don't encourage visitors.

08:02.682 --> 08:06.002
Um, a neutral topic perhaps.
News from home.

08:08.602 --> 08:12.401
Sarah, why don't you tell James
about the engagement party

08:12.402 --> 08:14.321
while we discuss
the treatment outside.

08:14.322 --> 08:17.121
I'd rather not
involve Miss Adams.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.321
Olivia.

08:18.322 --> 08:19.641
Of course.

08:19.642 --> 08:22.881
Ash Park's never seen
anything like it.

08:22.882 --> 08:23.961
We had all the locals in,

08:23.962 --> 08:27.641
the hokey-pokey on the main lawn,
if you can imagine.

08:27.642 --> 08:30.442
Despite appearances, James is making
excellent headway.

08:32.202 --> 08:35.001
Roy Briggs even performed
a bush ballad.

08:42.682 --> 08:43.682
James...

08:45.082 --> 08:47.882
I know what they're doing to you.

08:49.122 --> 08:52.201
Oh, James.

08:52.202 --> 08:53.562
Yes?

09:05.202 --> 09:07.121
It's not working, is it?

09:07.122 --> 09:08.922
This torment.

09:14.042 --> 09:16.642
You don't have to stay.
You can come home.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.921
But if you want to leave
you must tell your father.

09:19.922 --> 09:21.601
He needs to be convinced.
Please.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.361
James, listen to me.

09:23.362 --> 09:25.161
What is being done to you...
Don't.

09:25.162 --> 09:28.441
We need to know exactly. Please.
Don't. No. No.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.281
You must tell me.
Don't. Don't!

09:30.282 --> 09:33.001
So when can he come home?
Not for some time.

09:33.002 --> 09:34.641
We don't want to
jeopardise progress.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.601
No!

09:36.602 --> 09:37.881
James!

09:37.882 --> 09:40.681
What's going on?
He's in a terrible physical state!

09:40.682 --> 09:42.921
He's being sedated
on a regular basis.

09:42.922 --> 09:44.401
And look at his arms.

09:44.402 --> 09:46.841
These bruises are consistent
with harsh restraints.

09:46.842 --> 09:47.881
That's enough!

09:47.882 --> 09:49.681
And there's only one thing
that causes this.

09:49.682 --> 09:51.561
A high voltage and lack of care
in the application.

09:51.562 --> 09:55.001
I must ask you to leave. Now.
Not without James.

09:55.002 --> 09:56.641
I refuse to be lectured to

09:56.642 --> 09:58.881
by a woman who has no knowledge
of what is happening.

09:58.882 --> 10:01.082
I'm a nurse. I understand
exactly what's happening.

10:02.162 --> 10:05.321
You bring a nurse in the guise
of your fiancee to poke and pry?

10:05.322 --> 10:07.281
This is outrageous!

10:07.282 --> 10:09.921
Your ill-informed opinions
are not required.

10:09.922 --> 10:11.882
Miss Adams is my fiancee.

10:12.882 --> 10:16.321
George Bligh and a nurse.

10:16.322 --> 10:18.601
Your tone is offensive, Doctor.

10:18.602 --> 10:19.481
Livvy.

10:19.482 --> 10:23.641
What I find offensive is you
bringing someone in, fiancee or not,

10:23.642 --> 10:25.401
to investigate my methods.

10:25.402 --> 10:27.601
You have to take him out of here.
Leave now!

10:27.602 --> 10:29.241
You've undone weeks of work
in a moment.

10:29.242 --> 10:31.321
George, only you can sign him out.
Mr Bligh!

10:31.322 --> 10:32.801
He's being brutalised!

10:32.802 --> 10:35.121
I refuse to be lectured to
by a nurse

10:35.122 --> 10:37.401
who has no idea
of what is being done.

10:37.402 --> 10:39.001
I have every idea.

10:39.002 --> 10:42.242
I've had it done to me.
I've survived barbarians like you.

10:48.042 --> 10:49.441
Sarah.
But...

10:49.442 --> 10:50.442
Please!

10:53.602 --> 10:56.641
You've been in a mental hospital?
What matters now is James.

10:56.642 --> 10:58.441
You can't just say
something like that...

10:58.442 --> 11:01.522
You can't ignore...
ignore what's going on.

11:02.722 --> 11:06.281
You're too personally involved.
It's best you stay here.

11:06.282 --> 11:09.882
If you leave him here,
we are finished.

11:11.162 --> 11:12.481
You're upset.

11:12.482 --> 11:15.962
I can't be with a man
who'd abandon him to this.

11:29.162 --> 11:31.042
Stop!

11:32.602 --> 11:34.322
I'd like to talk to my son.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.802
Olivia.

11:46.922 --> 11:48.442
I knew you'd see reason.

11:50.002 --> 11:53.241
You don't want a son who spends
his life furtively seeking out...

11:53.242 --> 11:54.962
Not a word until I've finished.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.162
James.

12:07.962 --> 12:14.162
When I found out, I said
some hurtful things that I truly
regret.

12:17.082 --> 12:19.002
We love you.

12:21.202 --> 12:25.321
I love you, James, and we will
get through this together.

12:25.322 --> 12:26.802
We will.

12:28.522 --> 12:30.242
Do you understand?

12:31.202 --> 12:33.562
Look at me, not him.

12:38.082 --> 12:43.002
Tell me truthfully,
do you want to stay?

12:46.202 --> 12:47.962
Tell me what your heart says.

13:13.162 --> 13:15.602
This is a sad day for your family,
Mr Bligh.

14:00.146 --> 14:02.145
How does this sound?

14:02.146 --> 14:04.065
What is it?
My engagement notice.

14:04.066 --> 14:06.126
You're not one to waste time,
are you?

14:06.176 --> 14:07.975
I thought I'd save Father
the trouble.

14:07.976 --> 14:10.055
I'm happy for you, my darling.

14:10.056 --> 14:13.656
You fought for love and you won.
Not everyone is so fortunate.

14:15.616 --> 14:20.215
Look at you, staring dreamily
off into the distance.

14:20.216 --> 14:21.936
You're as bad as he is.

14:23.056 --> 14:25.055
Jack Duncan.
Oh!

14:25.056 --> 14:26.415
He blushes
whenever he talks about you.

14:26.416 --> 14:29.895
You're imagining things.

14:29.896 --> 14:32.215
He's been acting strangely
since you arrived.

14:32.216 --> 14:34.415
Perhaps it's true love.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.415
This isn't one of your novels.

14:36.416 --> 14:37.855
Isn't it?
No!

14:37.856 --> 14:40.095
I'm worried about someone.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.495
Grandmother?
No.

14:42.496 --> 14:44.495
It's not for me to tell.

14:44.496 --> 14:46.736
I'll finish this, then.

14:48.616 --> 14:50.056
It really is wonderful.

14:53.856 --> 14:55.576
They're here.

14:59.976 --> 15:02.535
How is he?
Let's get him to bed.

15:02.536 --> 15:04.615
James! What's wrong with him?

15:04.616 --> 15:05.615
Later.

15:05.616 --> 15:07.615
Olivia said the flu. It's not, is it?
Not now.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.695
But look at him!
Anna, please.

15:09.696 --> 15:10.855
I'll call Dr Duncan.

15:10.856 --> 15:13.975
Can't you see to him?
He needs a doctor.

15:13.976 --> 15:15.775
We can trust Jack.

15:15.776 --> 15:17.296
Alright.

15:23.616 --> 15:25.096
Livvy...
I'm here.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.055
You're home.

15:30.056 --> 15:33.416
Home?
At Ash Park.

15:35.216 --> 15:39.175
I've let you down.
No.

15:39.176 --> 15:41.096
You're safe now.

15:43.856 --> 15:45.376
Thank you.

15:56.136 --> 15:57.695
You and him.

15:57.696 --> 15:59.255
Shhh.

15:59.256 --> 16:01.815
You and him got me through.

16:01.816 --> 16:04.855
Your father loves you.

16:04.856 --> 16:06.376
Not him.

16:08.056 --> 16:09.335
Him.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.016
You just rest now.

16:16.416 --> 16:19.095
George... Oh, for goodness' sake,
who's been in your ear?

16:19.096 --> 16:20.536
Has Miss...

16:21.496 --> 16:23.056
He was doing well.

16:26.696 --> 16:28.176
Oh, if you insist.

16:29.136 --> 16:30.896
We'll speak at home.

16:32.856 --> 16:34.535
Problems?

16:34.536 --> 16:39.335
A storm in a teacup, I'm sure,
but I'd best return immediately.

16:39.336 --> 16:41.775
Of course.

16:41.776 --> 16:43.695
And given the circumstances,

16:43.696 --> 16:46.495
I think it prudent to cancel
any Christmas plans.

16:46.496 --> 16:48.775
That's a shame.

16:48.776 --> 16:52.096
But rest assured,
I am most simpatico to your cause.

16:53.176 --> 16:55.216
I'll organise a car.
Thank you.

17:33.336 --> 17:35.456
We're together again.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.456
That's what matters.

17:41.216 --> 17:42.895
He's taking his time.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.975
I'm sure he's just being thorough.

17:44.976 --> 17:48.855
How could you let him be locked up?
He had a mental collapse.

17:48.856 --> 17:51.855
You almost abandoned him.
It's not the time, Anna.

17:51.856 --> 17:53.455
No! Someone should have told me.

17:53.456 --> 17:55.855
Why? What could you have done?

17:55.856 --> 17:58.775
Other than not treat him like
something disgusting, I'm not sure.

17:58.776 --> 18:01.455
I can't act like it's normal.
It's not.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.856
I just don't understand.
This isn't helping.

18:08.616 --> 18:10.376
How is he?

18:11.336 --> 18:13.656
He suffered
some pretty serious trauma.

18:14.816 --> 18:17.895
Physically, he should recover
soon enough.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.135
Mentally?

18:19.136 --> 18:22.135
Not being a psychiatrist,
that's harder to say.

18:22.136 --> 18:23.855
You must have some idea.

18:23.856 --> 18:26.975
What I do know of shock therapy
suggests its effects pass with time.

18:26.976 --> 18:29.335
They do.

18:29.336 --> 18:30.415
Oh, thank God!

18:30.416 --> 18:34.255
I am worried about one thing.

18:34.256 --> 18:38.975
I don't know the first thing about
dealing with, um, the other stuff.

18:38.976 --> 18:41.495
His attraction to men.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.416
The time for tiptoeing has passed.

18:47.456 --> 18:49.175
Maybe you should get
someone else in.

18:49.176 --> 18:50.975
We need someone we can trust.

18:50.976 --> 18:53.176
You need someone
who can understand his condition.

18:54.136 --> 18:56.055
Not my area.

18:56.056 --> 18:58.856
You heal his body.
The rest is up to us now.

19:07.176 --> 19:09.976
Mr James,
I brought you something to eat.

19:12.856 --> 19:15.656
Um, would you like me to just...

19:22.416 --> 19:24.815
Oh, sir!

19:24.816 --> 19:27.296
Just my wife! Just Livvy!

19:34.496 --> 19:36.335
With our love and support
he will get through,

19:36.336 --> 19:38.535
but if word got out
he'd carry the shame forever.

19:38.536 --> 19:40.775
It would destroy us.

19:40.776 --> 19:44.496
I hate to ask you to keep things
from Gino, but he'd never understand.

19:46.416 --> 19:49.255
I'm sorry. Mrs Bligh, he needs you.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.056
Excuse me.

19:53.416 --> 19:55.815
James?
I'm sorry.

19:55.816 --> 19:58.415
I'm sorry.
It's alright.

19:58.416 --> 20:00.495
I'm sorry.

20:00.496 --> 20:02.695
What happened? I should get Jack.

20:02.696 --> 20:04.536
Amy?
Yes, ma'am?

20:06.976 --> 20:09.135
No, go!
James!

20:09.136 --> 20:11.055
Go!
I should really clean...

20:11.056 --> 20:13.056
Clean it up later. Get Jack.

20:14.136 --> 20:16.895
Darling, what's wrong?
It's just Amy.

20:16.896 --> 20:19.215
It's her. She...

20:19.216 --> 20:21.736
She reminds me of...

20:22.776 --> 20:24.855
Reminds you of who?

20:24.856 --> 20:26.496
The treatment.

20:27.896 --> 20:29.536
I get sick.

20:32.896 --> 20:35.416
Thoughts.
Sh-sh-sh.

20:38.336 --> 20:40.215
Sorry.

20:40.216 --> 20:45.335
You and him,
you and him will save me.

20:45.336 --> 20:48.776
James, who are you talking about?

20:50.856 --> 20:53.016
She made me think of him.

21:06.136 --> 21:07.656
Harry.

21:10.696 --> 21:13.096
I do hope nothing's too amiss.

21:14.136 --> 21:17.855
Anything I can do?
There's not.

21:17.856 --> 21:21.215
I'll press on with our plans
for the Adams woman.

21:21.216 --> 21:23.175
Thank you. And for your hospitality.

21:23.176 --> 21:24.175
Oh!

21:24.176 --> 21:27.656
- I do hope to be able to reciprocate.
- Yes.

21:28.816 --> 21:30.536
Thank you.

21:38.616 --> 21:41.335
I'm surprised you're still
interested in the Bligh minx.

21:41.336 --> 21:44.775
She adds spice to this ridiculous
need you have for me to marry.

21:44.776 --> 21:46.975
And if her final choice is the dago?

21:46.976 --> 21:48.896
Don't be absurd.

21:56.976 --> 21:59.456
Is he settling?
He's asleep.

22:01.416 --> 22:05.215
I'm sorry for my ultimatum
at the hospital.

22:05.216 --> 22:07.496
Never use our relationship again
as a threat.

22:09.936 --> 22:11.896
You had shock treatment?

22:13.456 --> 22:15.256
Not here.

22:17.896 --> 22:20.016
You asked what happened
during the war.

22:23.136 --> 22:26.776
All you need to know
to understand this is...

22:29.296 --> 22:32.216
..it's what came after
that made me lose my mind.

22:35.496 --> 22:37.296
I'd survived for Rene.

22:38.936 --> 22:41.055
And when I eventually did get home

22:41.056 --> 22:43.096
no-one knew whether
he was alive or dead.

22:44.816 --> 22:48.095
So I waited for the telephone to ring

22:48.096 --> 22:50.255
or for him to step off
one of the trains

22:50.256 --> 22:51.856
that brought the survivors back.

22:54.456 --> 22:59.456
The stations were full of people
like me, searching the faces.

23:01.696 --> 23:04.056
Scarecrow faces.

23:05.936 --> 23:07.856
But he never came.

23:09.456 --> 23:12.856
The truth did, though, finally.

23:13.856 --> 23:16.096
From a man who'd seen him die.

23:17.456 --> 23:22.655
And I heard this scream,
this piercing scream,

23:22.656 --> 23:25.135
and it was mine.

23:25.136 --> 23:28.375
I fell into this darkness.

23:28.376 --> 23:30.096
Oh, Sarah.

23:31.336 --> 23:34.095
I woke in the hospital weeks later,

23:34.096 --> 23:37.215
strapped to a bed, with electricity
burning through my brain,

23:37.216 --> 23:39.736
being tortured
in the name of normalcy.

23:45.176 --> 23:48.536
I would have said anything
to stop you leaving James to that.

23:53.376 --> 23:57.016
Thank you for trusting me.

24:19.055 --> 24:20.415
How is he?

24:25.615 --> 24:29.455
Dr Duncan's with him again.
Can I see him?

24:30.975 --> 24:33.895
It might be best left for now.

24:40.815 --> 24:42.015
Anna...

24:44.255 --> 24:49.935
I-I think James
formed a... an affection..

24:51.335 --> 24:54.255
..before we left for the city.

24:55.335 --> 24:56.815
Who was it?

24:59.255 --> 25:01.414
Amy's brother.

25:01.415 --> 25:03.055
Oh, Livvy!

25:06.175 --> 25:09.695
It must be why he sought treatment.

25:14.335 --> 25:19.415
He ran from it, and he put himself
through all of that...

25:20.535 --> 25:22.055
..for me.

25:24.415 --> 25:25.975
For us.

25:33.535 --> 25:35.375
A little early for that.

25:36.975 --> 25:40.255
I'm girding my loins
for Mother's arrival.

25:43.055 --> 25:45.215
Did you ever suspect?

25:46.895 --> 25:48.414
He hid it deep.

25:48.415 --> 25:51.534
You think he should accept
what he is, don't you?

25:51.535 --> 25:53.614
Many do.

25:53.615 --> 25:56.175
And what about Livvy?
And the baby?

25:57.175 --> 25:59.974
There lies the complication.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.974
Well, at least with them
he won't end up old and alone.

26:02.975 --> 26:07.614
If men like him were allowed love,
they'd soon find it.

26:07.615 --> 26:10.015
It's society that condemns them
to loneliness.

26:13.055 --> 26:15.255
I'm on my soapbox. Sorry.

26:17.055 --> 26:19.814
I'm off.

26:19.815 --> 26:22.254
I'll see you out.
No need.

26:22.255 --> 26:23.775
I will.

26:28.775 --> 26:30.735
I almost told her today.

26:31.695 --> 26:34.254
I know what we said.

26:34.255 --> 26:35.935
I won't.

26:37.135 --> 26:39.614
George doesn't need that
on top of this.

26:39.615 --> 26:41.415
You're a wonderful man.

26:42.895 --> 26:44.895
Well, yell if you need help
with your mother, huh?

27:04.055 --> 27:05.855
Yes?

27:08.535 --> 27:10.575
May I?
Of course.

27:18.615 --> 27:20.175
Thank you, George.

27:21.535 --> 27:24.054
Any father would have
done the same.

27:24.055 --> 27:27.615
Some. A lot wouldn't.

27:37.255 --> 27:38.935
What now?

27:45.975 --> 27:47.814
That's up to you.

27:47.815 --> 27:49.894
And you.

27:49.895 --> 27:54.975
His collapse came from your disgust.
Yes.

27:56.975 --> 28:00.894
Sarah has had exposure to
this sort of thing. With her help...

28:00.895 --> 28:02.615
And your love.

28:04.415 --> 28:06.735
Our love.

28:13.255 --> 28:15.615
But we have to give him the choice.

28:18.335 --> 28:19.814
I beg your pardon?

28:19.815 --> 28:23.775
We cannot incarcerate him
in this life.

28:24.815 --> 28:27.295
Or we're no better than Dr Milson.

28:28.335 --> 28:30.375
But what if he chooses that?

28:33.335 --> 28:35.375
It would break my heart.

28:38.335 --> 28:44.255
But so would living with him
as his jailer.

29:04.975 --> 29:06.894
She thinks she can stop it.

29:06.895 --> 29:09.095
Oh! Rispetto.

29:11.415 --> 29:13.614
Amy. Thank you.

29:13.615 --> 29:14.775
Grandmother!

29:16.335 --> 29:17.974
You're here for James?

29:17.975 --> 29:19.694
I'm glad.

29:19.695 --> 29:21.414
How is he?
He's...

29:21.415 --> 29:23.174
Is he in his room?
Yes.

29:23.175 --> 29:24.174
Grandmother...

29:24.175 --> 29:25.614
I trust your father stressed
the importance

29:25.615 --> 29:27.134
of this not leaving the family.

29:27.135 --> 29:28.134
Of course.

29:28.135 --> 29:30.774
The inner family, which does not
include your inamorato.

29:30.775 --> 29:32.694
Gino and I are getting married.

29:32.695 --> 29:35.534
Father gave his blessing yesterday.

29:35.535 --> 29:37.814
I've moved back until the wedding.

29:37.815 --> 29:39.255
I see.

29:40.615 --> 29:44.054
Hm. One can only imagine
your contribution to all of this.

29:44.055 --> 29:46.895
Climb down off your high horse,
Mother, please, for once.

29:48.255 --> 29:50.535
There are things you should know
before you go up.

30:03.055 --> 30:04.694
James.

30:04.695 --> 30:06.695
Look who it is.

30:16.695 --> 30:17.895
James.

30:19.615 --> 30:21.735
Can you hear me?

30:22.695 --> 30:24.215
Grandmother.

30:27.535 --> 30:29.455
Oh, my poor boy.

30:31.775 --> 30:33.895
You left me.

30:34.975 --> 30:37.814
I thought you wanted
to stay the course.

30:37.815 --> 30:40.615
I said, "Help me."

30:44.415 --> 30:46.895
Help?
I begged.

30:49.695 --> 30:51.855
And then you left.

30:53.775 --> 30:55.335
You left me.

30:57.615 --> 30:59.694
Forgive me.

30:59.695 --> 31:01.575
I didn't know.

31:05.135 --> 31:07.095
Forgive me.

31:15.895 --> 31:17.415
Oh.

31:28.368 --> 31:30.108
Oh, there you are.

31:30.168 --> 31:33.047
Apparently you've given Anna
your blessing.

31:33.048 --> 31:36.527
They're in love.
I believe that won't change.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.847
The agreement
was a three-month trial.

31:38.848 --> 31:41.368
You were wrong about James
and you're wrong about this!

31:48.408 --> 31:50.688
That was uncalled for.

31:53.008 --> 31:54.488
I did let myself be deceived.

31:56.288 --> 31:57.927
And I have to live with
the knowledge

31:57.928 --> 31:59.608
that I abandoned him to that.

32:03.568 --> 32:08.447
Anna and Gino,
I simply ask one thing -

32:08.448 --> 32:11.287
if I have the right to ask anything
of anybody anymore -

32:11.288 --> 32:15.207
that we defer any public announcement
until after Christmas.

32:15.208 --> 32:18.568
I'd rather not muddy the festivities
with any adverse reactions.

32:19.528 --> 32:21.207
And then?

32:21.208 --> 32:23.048
What will be will be.

32:24.008 --> 32:25.967
So can that be arranged?

32:25.968 --> 32:28.847
I'll speak with Anna.

32:28.848 --> 32:31.527
Good.

32:31.528 --> 32:34.367
That way we can focus our attentions
on James.

32:34.368 --> 32:36.208
Yes.

32:40.168 --> 32:42.848
I was expecting more of a fight.

32:43.848 --> 32:45.367
Anna?

32:45.368 --> 32:48.648
Hm. It's a bed of her own making.

33:01.568 --> 33:06.887
Mildred, I'd like to place a long
distance call, please, to Sydney.

33:06.888 --> 33:08.647
Person to person.

33:08.648 --> 33:10.848
Mr Andrew Swanson.

33:14.528 --> 33:16.087
I must admit
I was beginning to think

33:16.088 --> 33:18.807
something had happened at Ash Park
you were gone so long.

33:18.808 --> 33:23.288
I stayed for a bite of lunch.
Everything alright there, I trust?

33:24.488 --> 33:26.407
I knew it!

33:26.408 --> 33:30.207
I saw you and Miss Carolyn
at the engagement party.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.647
Enough sparks to start a bushfire!

33:32.648 --> 33:34.967
You need that imagination
of yours seen to.

33:34.968 --> 33:36.967
Sister Carvolth's birthday,
you said.

33:36.968 --> 33:40.087
If you would be so kind.
I feel terrible forgetting the date.

33:40.088 --> 33:43.007
You will keep my asking
under your hat, won't you?

33:43.008 --> 33:44.567
I'll do my best.

33:44.568 --> 33:46.807
Falling in the middle
of the festive season,

33:46.808 --> 33:49.127
I can never remember
whether it's the 27th or the...

33:49.128 --> 33:51.287
It's the 27th.
Oh, I thought so.

33:51.288 --> 33:54.368
Wouldn't want her to miss out
on your famous pound cake, hm?

33:55.408 --> 33:58.367
If there's anything I should know
about the Blighs...

33:58.368 --> 34:00.848
'Bye, Doris.
Indeed, indeed.

34:15.248 --> 34:16.766
Jack.

34:16.768 --> 34:18.367
Sorry to disturb you.

34:18.368 --> 34:21.607
Um, you haven't got any idea where
your employment file is, do you?

34:21.608 --> 34:22.607
No.

34:22.608 --> 34:24.206
It's missing.

34:24.208 --> 34:28.007
You didn't take it?
Of course not.

34:28.007 --> 34:29.647
It must be misfiled, then.

34:29.648 --> 34:30.647
Right.

34:30.648 --> 34:33.087
I'll keep looking. Just thought
I'd check with you first.

34:33.088 --> 34:34.608
See you tomorrow.

34:42.808 --> 34:44.927
When you hear I'm gone,

34:44.928 --> 34:47.087
don't take solace in the fact.

34:47.088 --> 34:49.848
There's many a slip
twixt the cup and the altar.

34:51.088 --> 34:52.568
Shalom.

35:35.648 --> 35:37.128
Hungry?

35:39.848 --> 35:42.008
I'll organise a tray
to be brought up.

35:51.288 --> 35:53.048
I'm happy to be home...

35:55.128 --> 35:56.968
..with you and him.

36:00.728 --> 36:02.128
What's wrong?

36:03.808 --> 36:09.608
You keep mentioning... him.

36:11.368 --> 36:15.368
Him. Her.

36:18.368 --> 36:20.807
You mean the baby?

36:20.808 --> 36:25.648
Every night I...
I thought of you both.

36:30.888 --> 36:33.568
It kept me going.

36:35.728 --> 36:37.568
James, it's alright.

36:38.528 --> 36:42.688
I can get better with you.

36:45.768 --> 36:48.367
Listen to me.

36:48.368 --> 36:52.488
If you felt that you had no choice...

36:53.728 --> 36:57.087
..but that side of you,
I would try...

36:57.088 --> 36:58.928
No. No.

37:01.248 --> 37:03.368
As long as I have you.

37:05.368 --> 37:06.688
Him.

37:08.488 --> 37:09.608
Her.

37:12.248 --> 37:14.048
No.

37:35.808 --> 37:37.848
Miss Adams.

37:41.128 --> 37:44.208
My personal file has gone missing
from the hospital.

37:46.808 --> 37:51.368
Is there a reason you mention it?
Oh, it's on my mind.

37:54.128 --> 37:56.447
Well, you are a woman of mystery,
Miss Adams.

37:56.448 --> 37:59.727
Perhaps someone's curiosity
got the better of them.

37:59.728 --> 38:01.727
Or perhaps it's simply been mislaid.

38:01.728 --> 38:04.968
Or perhaps this three months trial
was you playing for time.

38:18.886 --> 38:21.586
Your nonna, after Christmas
she will say yes?

38:21.672 --> 38:22.752
So she says.

38:22.777 --> 38:26.976
But she has a lot of things
on her mind, so that may change.

38:26.977 --> 38:27.976
Ah.

38:27.977 --> 38:29.856
James is home and he's not well.

38:29.857 --> 38:32.217
Ah, that's no good.

38:35.657 --> 38:37.136
Gino.
Yep.

38:37.137 --> 38:39.296
We'll finish
the other field tomorrow.

38:39.297 --> 38:40.817
Si, Papa.

38:48.297 --> 38:50.016
What is it?
What?

38:50.017 --> 38:51.737
I know when you're hiding something.

38:52.817 --> 38:55.457
You know I'll never lie to you.
Of course.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.936
But there's something
that I can't tell you.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.576
I just can't.

39:00.577 --> 39:05.016
Why not?
I just can't.

39:05.017 --> 39:07.216
So if I can't be honest,

39:07.217 --> 39:10.256
I want to at least be honest
about not being honest.

39:10.257 --> 39:15.096
Only you would say
something like that.

39:15.097 --> 39:17.536
Just one secret.

39:17.537 --> 39:19.937
Please, just one,
and I promise never another.

39:21.137 --> 39:22.897
One.

39:23.537 --> 39:25.577
I love you.

39:32.737 --> 39:34.817
Come.

39:41.457 --> 39:43.536
It's that bad.

39:43.537 --> 39:44.776
Elizabeth.

39:44.777 --> 39:47.176
From the look on your face.

39:47.177 --> 39:50.656
Oh, it's nothing to do with that.
We've got her on the back foot.

39:50.657 --> 39:53.456
No, this is an idea I've had.

39:53.457 --> 39:56.096
Should I be worried?

39:56.097 --> 39:58.776
Can you get some time off
before Christmas?

39:58.777 --> 40:01.736
I'm the boss. Why?

40:01.737 --> 40:03.816
I'm hosting a party in Sydney.

40:03.817 --> 40:06.577
We could kill two birds
with one stone.

40:07.817 --> 40:10.496
And what birds might they be?

40:10.497 --> 40:13.017
It would give you some insight
that may help you with James.

40:14.777 --> 40:18.136
What sort of party is this?
You'll see.

40:18.137 --> 40:21.657
And it will give us a chance
to spend some more time together.

40:22.857 --> 40:25.576
Just us.

40:25.577 --> 40:26.857
Right.

40:27.937 --> 40:29.377
No obligation.

40:30.417 --> 40:32.177
Yeah, I'd like that.

40:34.817 --> 40:36.177
Yeah.

40:39.577 --> 40:43.617
Olivia said that you've committed
to her and the baby.

40:46.937 --> 40:49.377
It never needs to be
spoken of again.

40:51.137 --> 40:54.177
It's like it was all a bad dream.

40:55.777 --> 40:59.056
That's a good way to think of it,
yes.

40:59.057 --> 41:02.377
Just like you've woken
from a bad dream.

41:09.617 --> 41:11.297
There's the chap.

41:24.497 --> 41:26.377
I didn't want to interrupt.

41:27.337 --> 41:28.737
Fresh air?

42:13.577 --> 42:15.657
I'd hoped never to burden you
with this.

42:17.017 --> 42:18.576
But they've forced my hand.

42:18.577 --> 42:21.336
Who?
Your mother.

42:21.337 --> 42:22.817
Regina.

42:24.377 --> 42:26.776
Before she left
I saw her at the hospital.

42:26.777 --> 42:28.657
She had this smug manner to her.

42:30.737 --> 42:34.176
Jack's just discovered
my employment records are missing.

42:34.177 --> 42:37.216
I think they've been taken
to guide a search into my past,

42:37.217 --> 42:40.256
and given the Nazi obsession
with record-keeping

42:40.257 --> 42:41.856
it's all there to be found.

42:41.857 --> 42:43.897
What could be found?

42:46.097 --> 42:49.577
The full story of what happened
to me at Ravensbruck.

42:52.497 --> 42:54.977
To hear it from anyone else
would be the end of us.

42:58.737 --> 43:01.057
It may be anyway.

43:07.177 --> 43:08.736
The confession...

43:08.737 --> 43:10.776
I should have told you before.

43:10.777 --> 43:12.336
..he never saw coming.

43:12.337 --> 43:14.737
Can you marry someone
with that in their past?

43:16.137 --> 43:17.817
Don't come back until you are sure.

43:18.417 --> 43:21.097
Do I detect a certain tension?
Stay out of it.

43:24.177 --> 43:28.976
But is it the only thing
that's about to end?

43:28.977 --> 43:31.297
I'm carrying all the hopes
of our little one.

43:32.977 --> 43:34.537
You won't marry him.

43:36.777 --> 43:39.377
It will bring this
misalliance to an end.

43:40.257 --> 43:41.697
I know what you're doing.
