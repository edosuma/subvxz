WEBVTT

00:01.378 --> 00:03.338
Previously in "The 100"...

00:03.546 --> 00:04.589
Let the people know
they have a new commander.

00:04.798 --> 00:06.257
You don't have
the flame, Ontari.

00:06.466 --> 00:08.969
- No one knows that.
- He does.

00:10.345 --> 00:11.930
Is she really
in there?

00:12.138 --> 00:13.515
Of course she is.

00:13.723 --> 00:16.142
This is yours now,
Fleimkepa.

00:16.351 --> 00:19.145
We need to increase the
population in the city of light.

00:19.354 --> 00:21.064
The more minds
turned to the task,

00:21.272 --> 00:23.191
the more powerful
Alie becomes

00:23.400 --> 00:27.445
and the closer we get to
finding that second a.I.

00:27.654 --> 00:29.614
Pike just sentenced
Lincoln and Sinclair to death

00:29.823 --> 00:31.116
alongside Kane.

00:31.324 --> 00:32.826
We can save them,
but we have to work together.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.036
You're the reason
they need saving.

00:35.245 --> 00:37.747
They're searching the station.
We need to go now.

00:37.956 --> 00:39.874
I love you.

00:41.334 --> 00:43.211
- No.
- Just get her out of here.

00:45.005 --> 00:46.965
Lincoln of Trikru,
you have been sentenced

00:47.173 --> 00:50.093
to death in accordance
with the exodus charter.

00:50.301 --> 00:53.304
- Any last words?
- Not for you.

01:48.485 --> 01:50.445
Where's Lincoln?

01:53.198 --> 01:55.575
Pike put a bullet
in his brain.

01:59.996 --> 02:03.208
O., o.,
I am so sorry.

02:12.675 --> 02:14.260
Octavia, that's enough.

02:14.469 --> 02:16.679
Kane, stay
out of this.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.310
Uh!

02:23.436 --> 02:25.438
Uh!

02:27.148 --> 02:28.441
Uh!

02:31.736 --> 02:33.530
Uh!

02:33.738 --> 02:34.781
That's enough.

02:34.989 --> 02:35.824
Get out!

02:36.032 --> 02:37.742
Miller, back up.

02:41.246 --> 02:42.705
Uh!

02:42.914 --> 02:44.624
Aah!

02:46.042 --> 02:48.378
- Uh!
- Uh...

02:54.676 --> 02:57.137
You're dead to me.

03:50.523 --> 03:52.859
How long is this
gonna be necessary?

03:53.067 --> 03:54.444
Roan said not to let
you out of my sight

03:54.652 --> 03:56.070
until he got back.

03:56.279 --> 03:59.657
We're on the 50th floor.
Where am I gonna go?

03:59.866 --> 04:01.159
Look. I'm just saying
a real commander

04:01.367 --> 04:03.286
- wouldn't be afraid--
- I am a real commander.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.418
You gonna answer it?

04:15.757 --> 04:20.094
Oh, so the king doesn't
think you can handle it, huh?

04:20.303 --> 04:21.763
I thought you
were in charge.

04:21.971 --> 04:22.847
I am.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.227
Whatever you say.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.770
Enter.

04:34.859 --> 04:37.070
What is it,
ambassador?

04:56.381 --> 04:59.342
She will be there
soon.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.804
Why are you
in chains?

05:03.012 --> 05:05.098
That is
a good question.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.641
Where is
master Titus?

05:06.849 --> 05:09.435
Titus left

05:09.644 --> 05:11.020
to go find the next
class of novitiates.

05:11.229 --> 05:13.314
The flame keeper
has scouts for that.

05:13.523 --> 05:16.109
Yes. Well, the last
crop the scouts brought back

05:16.317 --> 05:18.903
kind of sucked,
didn't they?

05:34.419 --> 05:36.838
It's better to lie
your way out of a problem

05:37.046 --> 05:38.423
than kill.

05:38.631 --> 05:40.383
I saw your hand
go for your sword.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.968
So?

05:42.176 --> 05:44.470
So you can't just go around
killing your ambassadors.

05:44.679 --> 05:47.307
What did he
want you to do?

05:47.515 --> 05:49.767
Recite the lineage,

05:49.976 --> 05:54.105
the names of all
past commanders.

05:54.314 --> 05:58.067
It marks the start of
a new commander's reign.

05:58.276 --> 05:59.777
And how you
gonna do that?

06:02.989 --> 06:06.451
Look. Maybe
I can help you.

06:08.703 --> 06:11.164
How?

06:12.582 --> 06:15.335
I think much better
without a collar.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.508
"Prophet!"
Said I, "thing of evil!

06:22.717 --> 06:24.177
"Prophet still
if bird or devil!

06:24.385 --> 06:25.678
"Whether tempter sent,

06:25.887 --> 06:27.430
"or whether tempest
tossed thee here ashore,

06:27.638 --> 06:31.434
"desolate yet all undaunted,
on this desert land enchanted.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.478
"On this home
by horror haunted--

06:33.686 --> 06:35.730
"tell me truly, I implore.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.774
"Is there--balm in Gilead?

06:37.982 --> 06:39.442
Whether tempter sent or
whether tempest tossed..."

06:39.650 --> 06:40.777
I'm not sure
what you hope

06:40.985 --> 06:42.695
to accomplish
by doing this.

06:42.904 --> 06:44.238
"Desolate yet
all undaunted..."

06:44.447 --> 06:47.241
Sensory overload
can't block me out.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.785
"Home by
horror haunted--

06:48.993 --> 06:49.744
tell me truly..."

06:49.952 --> 06:50.912
I'm in you
now.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.122
"Is there--
balm in Gilead?

06:53.331 --> 06:55.208
"Tell me, tell me,
I implore.

06:59.796 --> 07:01.714
"Tell me, tell me, I implore.

07:01.923 --> 07:04.467
Quoth the raven, "nevermore."

07:07.470 --> 07:09.305
Will it work?

07:09.514 --> 07:11.682
Of course not.

07:11.891 --> 07:13.309
"Prophet!"
Said I, "thing of evil!

07:13.518 --> 07:15.395
"Prophet still
if bird or devil!

07:15.603 --> 07:17.355
Whether tempter sent or whether
tempest tossed thee..."

07:22.860 --> 07:25.238
"Horror haunted--
tell me truly, I implore,

07:25.446 --> 07:26.697
is there--
balm in Gilead..."

07:30.451 --> 07:31.953
"Whether tempter sent,

07:32.161 --> 07:34.539
or whether tempest
tossed thee here ashore--"

07:34.747 --> 07:35.915
you were saying?

07:36.124 --> 07:38.835
She's so much stronger
than the rest of you.

07:41.421 --> 07:45.591
OK. Come on.
Everyone out now.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.802
You, too,
Thelonious.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.514
This doesn't
concern you, Abby.

07:51.722 --> 07:52.890
Raven is with us now.

07:53.099 --> 07:55.560
That doesn't sound
creepy at all.

07:55.768 --> 07:58.604
We took away her pain,
Jasper.

07:58.813 --> 08:01.149
We saved her,
just like we can save you.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.609
Last chance before
I call the guards

08:03.818 --> 08:05.153
and I have them
move you away

08:05.361 --> 08:07.572
from my
patient's door.

08:09.449 --> 08:10.950
"Quoth the raven, "nevermore."

08:11.159 --> 08:13.870
Uh! Uh! Ah!

08:15.371 --> 08:17.457
I'm back in.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.751
You'll come around
eventually.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.337
Not likely.

08:30.178 --> 08:32.305
Oh...

08:32.513 --> 08:34.765
Raven, this
is pointless.

08:34.974 --> 08:36.893
Sensory stimulation
at the level required

08:37.101 --> 08:40.354
to force me out
is unsustainable.

08:40.563 --> 08:41.731
Leave me alone!

08:43.900 --> 08:45.234
Japser.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.740
Come in.
Come on.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.575
Raven,
what's wrong?

08:52.783 --> 08:54.994
I need your help to get
this thing out of my head,

08:55.203 --> 08:56.621
and I think I know
how to do it.

09:13.513 --> 09:15.973
Mom, what's wrong?

09:16.182 --> 09:18.726
Pike knows.

09:21.437 --> 09:23.814
Smile like
I just made a joke.

09:26.692 --> 09:31.989
You need to go
right now.

09:32.198 --> 09:34.200
Don't pack.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.577
Don't go
back to your room.

09:39.413 --> 09:43.668
Find your friends.
They'll protect you.

09:49.090 --> 09:51.759
Did you tell pike?

09:54.554 --> 09:57.765
Monty, you're my son.

09:57.974 --> 10:01.102
I won't lose both
of the men I love.

10:08.985 --> 10:11.028
Can I hug you?

10:17.076 --> 10:20.413
This can't look
like good-bye.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.170
Go.

10:59.285 --> 11:00.703
I say we run
two-man patrols

11:00.911 --> 11:03.456
around the clock,
starting now.

11:03.664 --> 11:07.084
We'll do that, but
we should be safe here.

11:07.293 --> 11:08.836
The grounder blockade
is too close for pike

11:09.045 --> 11:11.130
to--to risk
looking for us.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.258
Yeah, but are we safe
from the blockade?

11:14.467 --> 11:16.844
As long as we stay this side
of the line, we should be.

11:17.053 --> 11:18.387
They're grounders.

11:18.596 --> 11:19.722
You really think
they're gonna

11:19.930 --> 11:22.308
play by the rules?

11:22.516 --> 11:26.228
Hey, Pike'll
want you dead now, too.

11:26.437 --> 11:28.898
We take him out,
we can go home.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.274
We take him out,

11:30.483 --> 11:32.151
then the grounders
lift the blockade.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.153
That's right.

11:34.362 --> 11:37.365
We become
the 13th clan again.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.033
Those were
the terms.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.327
Lexa's terms.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.329
If what Bellamy says
is true and she's dead,

11:43.537 --> 11:45.373
how do we know the next
commander will honor them?

11:45.581 --> 11:46.916
One problem
at a time.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.209
What about Clarke?

11:48.417 --> 11:50.127
With Lexa gone,
she's not safe in Polis.

11:50.336 --> 11:52.463
Clarke made her choice.

11:52.672 --> 11:54.924
The only thing that matters
now is killing pike.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.052
Octavia's right.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.680
Once we resume our place
in the commander's coalition,

12:00.888 --> 12:04.016
Clarke will be safe,
so how do we do it?

12:04.225 --> 12:07.478
Monty, on radio:
Bellamy, come in. It's Monty.

12:07.687 --> 12:10.314
I'm in trouble. Please say
you still have your radio.

12:12.066 --> 12:14.443
If we respond and
pike's listening--

12:14.652 --> 12:16.696
Go to channel 7.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.323
"Please say you still
have your radio."

12:19.532 --> 12:21.909
That's 7 words after
the word "trouble."

12:23.869 --> 12:26.497
It's code. Go to 7.

12:38.843 --> 12:40.886
Bellamy, are you there?

12:44.056 --> 12:48.102
Monty, it's Kane.
What's wrong?

12:48.310 --> 12:50.396
Pike knows that
I helped you get out.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.525
Can you get
to the Dropship?

12:54.734 --> 12:55.693
I think so.

12:55.901 --> 12:59.155
Good. Go there.
I'll bring you in.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.574
Stay off the radio.
Over and out.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.370
Hold on. What if it's
a trap and pike's waiting?

13:06.579 --> 13:08.664
That's why
I'm going alone.

13:08.873 --> 13:11.333
Like hell you are.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.919
I'm with Octavia.

13:14.128 --> 13:16.130
Monty saved our lives.
I'm going, too.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.132
No, you're not.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.801
If it is a trap,
I'm not marching

13:21.010 --> 13:22.762
our entire insurgency
into it.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.973
To stop me, you're gonna
have to kill me.

13:27.266 --> 13:30.728
She hopes
it's a trap.

13:30.936 --> 13:33.022
He's coming, too.

13:33.230 --> 13:37.193
We'll need a hostage
to trade for Monty.

13:37.401 --> 13:41.906
It's a good plan.
He stays chained.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.282
Gag him.

13:43.491 --> 13:45.284
Sir, with
all due respect--

13:45.493 --> 13:47.077
he's the enemy.

13:50.164 --> 13:52.416
Do what I said.

14:03.969 --> 14:06.555
First, raven refuses
to take back our machine,

14:06.764 --> 14:09.850
and now she's looking
for ways to leave us.

14:10.059 --> 14:13.354
I'm telling you,
doubt spreads like a virus.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.190
It's not logical.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.943
According to the data,
all human behavior

14:19.151 --> 14:22.696
revolves around
the avoidance of pain.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.658
I offer an escape
from suffering.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.786
Why would anyone
resist this?

14:28.994 --> 14:31.747
Logic has nothing
to do with it.

14:31.956 --> 14:33.541
Free will
is the problem.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.835
I told you, we have
to get around it.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.711
Around it how?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.547
Give raven back her pain.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.465
Remind her what life
was like without you.

14:41.674 --> 14:44.301
You're suggesting
I coerce complicity.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.137
I'm suggesting that
once we give consent

14:47.346 --> 14:49.181
and take the key,
we're yours,

14:49.390 --> 14:52.810
tools to be used to
accomplish our mission--

14:53.018 --> 14:55.646
saving the human race
by migrating

14:55.855 --> 14:58.023
what's left of it to
the city of light.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.608
In that way,
we're no different

14:59.817 --> 15:00.901
than the missiles
you launched

15:01.110 --> 15:02.319
a hundred years ago.

15:02.528 --> 15:03.696
You hacked
their programming.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.115
Now it's time
to hack ours.

15:06.323 --> 15:08.909
Override free will,
starting with raven's,

15:09.118 --> 15:12.121
and let's finish
what we started.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.873
Did you send the hundred
to the ground

15:14.081 --> 15:15.332
wearing biometric
wrist bands?

15:15.541 --> 15:16.375
Yes. Why?

15:16.584 --> 15:17.793
I'm telling you,
it will work.

15:18.002 --> 15:19.378
These wrist band were
designed to transmit

15:19.587 --> 15:21.839
vital signs, electrical
signals from the body.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.799
I designed them.
I know how they work.

15:24.008 --> 15:25.217
Then you know they
have a transponder.

15:25.426 --> 15:26.802
All we have to do
is reverse it,

15:27.011 --> 15:28.762
and then we can send an
energy pulse into my brain.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.931
If I'm right, it will fry
whatever Alie put in there

15:31.140 --> 15:32.391
without damaging
the tissue.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.851
What if
you're wrong?

15:34.059 --> 15:35.728
If I was wrong, Alie
wouldn't be looking at me

15:35.936 --> 15:38.898
right now like I stole
her favorite toy.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.484
She's here.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.320
You can see her?

15:44.528 --> 15:45.696
Yeah.

15:45.905 --> 15:47.239
Why, raven?

15:47.448 --> 15:49.241
With everything that
I can do for you,

15:49.450 --> 15:50.951
why would you
do this?

15:51.160 --> 15:53.579
Because you stole my memories,
you crazy bitch!

15:53.787 --> 15:55.414
Are there any
wrist bands left?

15:55.623 --> 15:58.042
I'm not sure.
We made more than we needed.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.836
It's possible
there could be a few

16:01.045 --> 16:03.088
still hanging around.

16:03.297 --> 16:05.925
Find them.

16:09.261 --> 16:10.471
Why?

16:10.679 --> 16:13.349
She may have found
a way to disconnect.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.142
Then we have
no choice.

16:15.351 --> 16:17.061
The wrist bands,
where are they?

16:17.269 --> 16:18.979
- I don't know.
- I do.

16:19.188 --> 16:20.147
No. No.

16:20.356 --> 16:21.690
Everything I hear,
she hears.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.233
Everything I see, she sees.

16:23.442 --> 16:26.111
Just--just tell him.

16:33.077 --> 16:36.372
Hey, we're gonna
fix you, all right?

16:36.580 --> 16:40.167
Tell him to stay.
Tell him you changed your mind.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.169
No!

16:42.378 --> 16:43.796
No.

16:45.214 --> 16:48.384
Then I'm sorry for this.

16:50.386 --> 16:54.682
No! Aah! Aah!

16:54.890 --> 16:56.892
Oh! Ah!

16:57.101 --> 16:58.352
What's wrong?

16:58.560 --> 17:00.437
Raven, talk to me.
OK. Talk to me.

17:00.646 --> 17:02.147
You wanted your
memories back.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.360
Here they are.

17:06.568 --> 17:11.115
Aah! Aah!

17:11.323 --> 17:14.076
No! No!

17:14.284 --> 17:17.287
Her heart's racing. Look.
We need to get her into medical.

17:17.496 --> 17:19.999
Ohh! Aah!

17:20.207 --> 17:21.959
Jackson, I need
a reaper stick.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.503
No. Make it stop.

17:24.712 --> 17:26.046
Get it now.

17:26.255 --> 17:28.215
Uh...Uh...No...

17:28.424 --> 17:30.509
No!

17:32.469 --> 17:34.388
D'aagh! No!

17:34.596 --> 17:36.348
Go get the wrist bands.

17:36.557 --> 17:38.767
Aah! Uh...

17:38.976 --> 17:40.561
What are you
waiting for? Go.

17:40.769 --> 17:41.979
Give her
what she wants.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.106
Aah! Uh!

17:44.314 --> 17:46.692
She's
about to break.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.402
Shh, it's OK.
It's OK.

17:48.610 --> 17:49.695
No!

17:49.903 --> 17:52.990
No! Aagh!

17:53.198 --> 17:54.700
- Make it stop.
- It's OK, sweetheart. OK.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.618
Jackson!

17:56.827 --> 17:59.371
Uh...No!

17:59.580 --> 18:01.248
I can
make it stop.

18:01.457 --> 18:03.459
I can lead you back
to the city of light.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.668
Aagh!

18:04.877 --> 18:06.837
All you have to do
is submit.

18:07.046 --> 18:09.631
No!

18:09.840 --> 18:11.967
No!

18:12.176 --> 18:14.470
Aah! I submit.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.722
Completely, raven,

18:16.930 --> 18:18.098
permanently.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.851
Aah! Aah!

18:21.060 --> 18:22.895
Ohh! No!

18:23.103 --> 18:26.857
Yes! I submit!
Please...

18:27.066 --> 18:28.650
Oh, please...

18:28.859 --> 18:30.944
What the hell
is wrong with you?

18:31.153 --> 18:33.280
Aah!

18:37.618 --> 18:38.786
Raven.

18:53.467 --> 18:58.222
I have full access to
raven's synaptic network.

19:00.099 --> 19:02.226
She's ours.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.420
"Seek higher things."

19:30.629 --> 19:32.548
Did you find it?

19:32.756 --> 19:35.300
No, just a
corporate motto.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.054
First commander
went into space

19:39.263 --> 19:41.223
to seek higher things.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.433
Get it?

19:43.642 --> 19:46.562
Heh, you know what?
Never mind.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.647
You said
it would be here.

19:48.856 --> 19:49.898
Maybe I was wrong, OK?

19:50.107 --> 19:51.483
I'm guessing that
to know the names

19:51.692 --> 19:53.485
of the dead commanders,
you actually have to be one.

19:53.694 --> 19:54.903
You got to get
the flame.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.405
You're guessing?

19:56.613 --> 19:58.657
The ambassadors
are expecting me.

19:58.866 --> 20:01.702
I'll have to kill
them all now.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.329
That seems
a bit excessive.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.543
I deserve
this throne.

20:09.751 --> 20:12.254
I was raised for it,

20:12.462 --> 20:16.258
snatched from my parents
by the queen of Azgeda.

20:16.466 --> 20:19.720
I suffered
her cruelty.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.347
I won the conclave.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.266
The ambassadors
don't get to judge me,

20:24.474 --> 20:26.143
and neither do you!

20:26.351 --> 20:30.189
OK. You're right.
You're right. We don't.

20:31.732 --> 20:34.443
No one does,
and we can use that.

20:35.569 --> 20:36.737
What are you
talking about?

20:36.945 --> 20:38.113
Roan. He's got you doing
everything wrong.

20:38.322 --> 20:40.407
- You're hiding.
- I'm not hiding.

20:40.616 --> 20:42.117
I'm waiting for him
to return with the flame.

20:42.326 --> 20:44.203
And what
if he doesn't?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.413
The longer we wait,
the harder it's gonna be

20:46.622 --> 20:47.831
to convince
the ambassadors

20:48.040 --> 20:49.166
that you're
the real thing.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.043
We?

20:51.251 --> 20:54.546
I can help you
sell this lie because--

20:54.755 --> 20:56.298
like it or not, Ontari--
a fake commander

20:56.506 --> 20:59.343
needs a fake
flame keeper.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.595
I'm listening.

21:20.530 --> 21:23.951
I'm gonna need
that case, Jasper.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.245
You can't have it.

21:31.250 --> 21:34.002
Hey, get off me!
Get off me!

21:35.212 --> 21:36.255
No!

21:36.463 --> 21:38.465
Jaha, don't do this.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.764
What are you doing?

21:45.973 --> 21:48.475
Don't do it. Oh! No!

21:57.734 --> 21:59.987
Monty?

22:02.531 --> 22:05.367
We got here first.

22:07.411 --> 22:08.912
No, we didn't.

22:09.121 --> 22:10.539
Hey, what
are you doing?

22:10.747 --> 22:13.500
Get outside now!

22:29.725 --> 22:32.436
They followed me.
I'm sorry.

22:34.855 --> 22:36.106
Let him go, pike.

22:36.315 --> 22:39.234
Can't do that.
One at their feet.

22:42.112 --> 22:45.073
It's over.
Put down your weapons.

22:45.282 --> 22:46.867
Shoot him.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.827
Monty's in the shot.

22:49.036 --> 22:51.204
Come on, Marcus.

22:53.582 --> 22:56.585
I promised Monty's mother
that I'd bring him home alive.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.712
Don't make me a liar.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.760
Kane, no.

23:11.058 --> 23:11.933
Now you.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.938
What are you doing?

23:17.147 --> 23:20.400
One in
the girl's leg.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.194
Uh!

23:22.402 --> 23:24.613
Yaah! Uh!

23:27.783 --> 23:30.494
Uh!
Let go.

23:30.702 --> 23:31.787
Ah!

23:42.422 --> 23:44.758
You don't
look so good.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.468
I'm fine.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.553
You got about 5 seconds
to make me believe

23:48.762 --> 23:50.722
you're still with me.

23:53.642 --> 23:56.353
All the others are in a
cave not far from here.

23:56.561 --> 23:58.522
You son
of a bitch!

23:58.730 --> 24:00.065
Uh!

24:08.573 --> 24:10.325
Give me
the coordinates.

24:10.534 --> 24:13.412
I don't have
the coordinates,

24:13.620 --> 24:15.664
but I can
take you there.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.764
You sure
about the route?

24:32.973 --> 24:35.600
We're getting close
to the blockade line.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.644
That's why Kane
set up out here.

24:37.853 --> 24:40.188
He didn't think
we'd risk it.

24:40.397 --> 24:42.399
He was wrong.

24:44.943 --> 24:47.529
What's gonna happen
to my sister?

24:47.737 --> 24:49.739
I know she has to answer
for her crimes, but--

24:49.948 --> 24:51.950
tell you what.

24:52.159 --> 24:56.329
I'll make you the same promise
I made to Monty's mother,

24:56.538 --> 24:58.331
immunity from all
past actions,

24:58.540 --> 24:59.541
but if she
screws up again--

24:59.749 --> 25:02.627
oh, she won't.
I'll make sure of it.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.716
My sister,
my responsibility.

25:22.314 --> 25:24.232
Welcome back.

25:29.446 --> 25:31.281
Not you, too.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.492
Abby,
it's a miracle.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.036
As doctors, it's our job
to relieve suffering.

25:36.244 --> 25:37.329
Shouldn't
you be--

25:37.537 --> 25:38.955
what are your mother's
name, Jackson?

25:44.586 --> 25:47.297
Mary Jackson died
in her son's arms

25:47.506 --> 25:50.800
after suffering
a terrible illness.

25:51.009 --> 25:53.261
Who am I talking to?

25:53.470 --> 25:56.765
It's Alie, right?

25:56.973 --> 26:01.645
Mary's death is the reason
he became a doctor.

26:04.981 --> 26:08.360
She take that
from you, too?

26:08.568 --> 26:10.987
How is that a miracle?

26:11.196 --> 26:13.031
All you
have to do is

26:13.240 --> 26:15.116
swallow the key and
see for yourself.

26:15.325 --> 26:16.993
That's never
gonna happen.

26:17.202 --> 26:20.121
He said
you'd say that.

26:20.330 --> 26:22.541
I want to talk
to raven.

26:22.749 --> 26:25.752
Raven's in
the city of light.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.170
All you have
to do to see--

26:27.379 --> 26:29.464
I said no.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.759
Abby, you've stopped us
for too long.

26:32.968 --> 26:35.637
We need you to tell
the people it's safe.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.347
What we're doing
is too important.

26:37.556 --> 26:41.434
What you're doing is
stealing people's minds.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.270
You're wrong.

26:43.478 --> 26:46.189
We're freeing
their minds,

26:46.398 --> 26:48.149
and we won't be done

26:48.358 --> 26:49.526
until everyone
is with us.

26:49.734 --> 26:53.154
I don't care
if you torture me.

26:53.363 --> 26:57.075
I will never
take the key.

26:57.284 --> 26:59.661
Who said anything
about torture?

27:06.835 --> 27:08.295
What are you doing?

27:08.503 --> 27:10.797
Giving you a choice.

27:11.006 --> 27:13.758
No. No. No, no,
no, no, no!

27:13.967 --> 27:17.137
No! Stop! Stop!

27:17.345 --> 27:19.889
No! No, no...

27:21.600 --> 27:24.853
Oh, God. Oh, God.

27:25.061 --> 27:27.939
Oh, God.
Oh...Oh...

27:28.148 --> 27:29.816
Oh, God.

27:30.025 --> 27:32.444
If you want
to save raven,

27:32.652 --> 27:36.531
all you have to do
is take the key.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.159
Thelonious, please.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.286
If I don't stop the bleeding,
she's gonna die.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.662
Her body will die,

27:42.871 --> 27:43.997
but her mind will
live forever.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.958
Please!

27:47.167 --> 27:49.294
Raven...

27:53.673 --> 27:56.092
I'm begging you,
let me go to her.

27:56.301 --> 28:00.096
Open your mouth and
hold out your tongue.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.850
I am the last Natblida,

28:46.059 --> 28:48.770
heir to Bekka Pramheda.

28:48.978 --> 28:52.774
I triumphed in the conclave,
and you are my subjects.

28:52.982 --> 28:55.985
I am the last Natblida,

28:56.194 --> 28:58.780
heir to Bekka Pramheda.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.907
I triumphed in the conclave,
and you are my--

29:03.910 --> 29:06.663
Commander...

29:08.707 --> 29:12.335
Ambassador Usak
demanded that he see you.

29:12.544 --> 29:14.796
Yes,

29:15.004 --> 29:17.048
but in
the throne room,

29:17.257 --> 29:20.009
not here in
this sacred space.

29:20.218 --> 29:22.470
This was his idea.

29:22.679 --> 29:24.973
I beg your pardon,
Ontari.

29:32.272 --> 29:34.232
Say my name again.

29:35.859 --> 29:37.444
Heda.

29:39.279 --> 29:43.616
Let me guess--you'd like
to hear the lineage.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.410
- Yes.
- No.

29:45.618 --> 29:46.870
You reign cannot
begin until you--

29:47.078 --> 29:49.372
my reign has
already begun.

29:49.581 --> 29:52.292
I am the last
Natblida,

29:52.500 --> 29:54.794
heir to
Bekka Pramheda.

29:55.003 --> 29:56.713
I triumphed
in the conclave,

29:56.921 --> 29:58.715
and you are
my subjects.

29:58.923 --> 30:01.342
We will be
your subjects

30:01.551 --> 30:05.054
after you recite
the lineage.

30:05.263 --> 30:07.265
Is my flame keeper
correct?

30:07.474 --> 30:08.975
Did you demand
to see me?

30:09.184 --> 30:11.853
If you think you
can intimidate--oh!

30:12.061 --> 30:13.605
Aah! Aah!

30:13.813 --> 30:14.773
Aah!

30:14.981 --> 30:16.399
Aah aah aah aah!

30:16.608 --> 30:18.860
Aah aah aah
aah aah!

30:19.068 --> 30:20.945
Aah!

30:23.364 --> 30:24.783
Now you see me.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.913
We talked about
restraint.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.457
You told me
not to kill him.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.210
Well, next time,
I'll be more specific.

30:45.845 --> 30:48.640
Hold on.

30:50.975 --> 30:54.312
Now, the cave is just
on the other side.

30:56.648 --> 30:59.150
Keep a sharp eye out.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.835
The blockade!
Anybody got eyes?

31:17.043 --> 31:19.295
Back up.
Back to higher ground.

31:19.504 --> 31:21.422
- Drop your weapon.
- What the hell are you doing?

31:21.631 --> 31:23.132
Drop your weapon!

31:25.093 --> 31:26.511
We bring you
chancellor pike

31:26.719 --> 31:27.971
of the sky people.

31:28.179 --> 31:30.348
O., translate.

31:36.229 --> 31:37.272
You killed us all.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.649
Take him.
Lift this blockade.

31:47.866 --> 31:48.992
Rrgh!

32:00.461 --> 32:01.546
Aah!

32:01.754 --> 32:03.214
No.

32:04.841 --> 32:06.634
Hey, no.

32:06.843 --> 32:07.886
No.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.597
The grounders are
gonna need him alive.

32:10.805 --> 32:12.891
They didn't get
justice for Finn.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.101
We won't get away
with that again.

32:15.310 --> 32:16.477
In that case--

32:16.686 --> 32:17.645
ugh...

32:19.397 --> 32:20.732
Uh...

32:26.946 --> 32:29.032
Where are you
taking him?

32:29.240 --> 32:31.075
To the new
commander.

32:31.284 --> 32:33.745
May I join you?

32:36.205 --> 32:37.790
We're the 13th clan.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.501
Don't slow us down.

32:42.545 --> 32:44.088
Are you sure?

32:44.297 --> 32:45.924
We know nothing about
the new commander.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.885
I'm sure. Go home.

32:49.093 --> 32:51.012
Tell our people
what happened here.

32:52.764 --> 32:56.142
Tell Abby I'll
look out for Clarke.

33:05.568 --> 33:07.445
Did you do this
for your sister...

33:09.656 --> 33:11.866
Or because it was
the right thing to do?

33:12.909 --> 33:15.286
You're welcome.

33:15.495 --> 33:17.664
It matters.

33:17.872 --> 33:20.833
Until you see that...

33:21.042 --> 33:23.628
You'll still be lost.

33:40.311 --> 33:43.022
My mom turned me in.

33:47.318 --> 33:50.446
You're family.

33:50.655 --> 33:53.282
You'll
work it out.

33:56.953 --> 33:59.038
Uh...

34:16.556 --> 34:19.225
Heda.

34:19.434 --> 34:20.727
Heda.

34:20.935 --> 34:21.978
- Heda.
- Heda.

34:22.186 --> 34:25.231
I'm tired and hungry.
No more meetings.

34:27.442 --> 34:29.652
Bring me wine.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.953
Oh, no, no, no.

34:39.162 --> 34:40.163
Easy there,
big fella.

34:40.371 --> 34:42.999
It's not
necessary, right?

34:43.207 --> 34:44.834
Put it on him.

34:45.043 --> 34:46.294
You--

34:52.341 --> 34:54.010
leave us.

34:54.218 --> 34:55.887
Let me know the moment
king roan returns.

34:56.095 --> 34:57.305
Heda.

35:02.185 --> 35:05.229
You want
to explain this?

35:05.438 --> 35:07.899
I don't trust you.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.817
Hmm. Well,
I got to say,

35:10.026 --> 35:12.153
I'm a little
hurt by that.

35:15.448 --> 35:18.242
How about now?

35:18.451 --> 35:20.495
Now I'm a little
less hurt.

35:23.247 --> 35:24.957
Wait.

35:28.961 --> 35:31.798
There's somebody else,
OK? I'm sorry.

35:32.006 --> 35:34.300
Is she
a commander, too?

35:34.509 --> 35:36.761
No.

35:46.479 --> 35:49.440
Would she kill you
if you ever lied to her...

35:49.649 --> 35:51.526
Uh!

35:51.734 --> 35:53.653
Did anything
to break her trust

35:53.861 --> 35:57.323
or upset her in even
the slightest way?

35:57.532 --> 35:59.033
Mm!

36:08.251 --> 36:11.045
Oh, the things
I do to survive.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.055
Nngh! Uh!

36:21.264 --> 36:23.808
Rrgh...Uh!

36:24.016 --> 36:26.060
Oh...Oh...

36:48.499 --> 36:50.543
I took one myself.

36:50.751 --> 36:53.838
Everything that
Thelonious said is true.

37:00.678 --> 37:01.554
Raven!

37:01.762 --> 37:03.556
Raven, you're not
gonna bel--

37:07.560 --> 37:08.978
what'd they do to you?

37:13.191 --> 37:15.443
They didn't
do anything.

37:15.651 --> 37:17.486
I'm sorry if I
frightened you today.

37:17.695 --> 37:18.946
I don't understand.

37:19.155 --> 37:20.114
You were just begging us
to get that thing

37:20.323 --> 37:21.449
out of your head.

37:21.657 --> 37:23.451
I was wrong.

37:23.659 --> 37:26.871
You can finally
see for yourself.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.207
All you have
to do is--

37:34.503 --> 37:37.256
He's taking raven.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.343
Come on.

37:46.140 --> 37:48.684
Find Jasper Jordan.
Bring him here.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.127
Oh, God.

38:18.923 --> 38:20.091
That's not good.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.718
Sorry about
your paint job, raven.

38:33.437 --> 38:34.480
Jasper?

38:34.689 --> 38:36.899
Clarke.

38:38.442 --> 38:40.278
Jasper,
what's going on?

38:40.486 --> 38:41.696
Get in!

38:41.904 --> 38:43.239
No. You don't understand.
I need to see Lincoln.

38:43.447 --> 38:44.490
You don't
understand.

38:44.699 --> 38:45.616
Lincoln is dead,
and we will be, too,

38:45.825 --> 38:46.826
if you don't
get in now!

38:48.577 --> 38:50.121
Why are they
shooting?

38:51.539 --> 38:52.540
I don't know.

38:52.748 --> 38:53.541
What do you mean,
Lincoln's dead?

38:53.749 --> 38:55.042
That can't be.

38:55.251 --> 38:56.168
Suddenly you don't
understand what dead means?

38:56.419 --> 38:57.461
I need him to
take me to Luna.

38:57.670 --> 38:58.504
He's the only one
who knows where she--

38:58.713 --> 39:01.382
shut up!
I don't care, OK?

39:06.095 --> 39:09.390
You really are the angel
of death, aren't you?

39:14.895 --> 39:16.897
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.901
Yes! Uh!

39:22.570 --> 39:23.654
Uh!

39:31.746 --> 39:33.456
Mom.

39:37.001 --> 39:39.045
As soon
as raven wakes

39:39.253 --> 39:41.047
and I see her
surroundings,

39:41.255 --> 39:42.548
we'll find them.

39:42.757 --> 39:44.216
When we do,
we'll find

39:44.425 --> 39:45.468
the rest of
their friends.

39:45.676 --> 39:48.888
Good. Now that
Arkadia has fallen,

39:49.096 --> 39:52.516
we'll move on
to stage two.
