WEBVTT

00:14.639 --> 00:15.932
Skadoosh.

01:26.294 --> 01:28.838
Dragon Master!

01:28.922 --> 01:31.007
Please help!

01:46.397 --> 01:47.232
Po?

01:48.233 --> 01:49.067
Po!

01:55.073 --> 01:55.907
Po!

02:00.036 --> 02:01.121
They're gone.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.040
Down the hill.
You should get going.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.001
Now, hold still, Po. You're hurt.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.795
What happened?

02:08.878 --> 02:11.798
My son was left to clean up your mess.

02:11.881 --> 02:15.093
I even defended you,
but look what's happened!

02:18.054 --> 02:19.556
Po… I--

02:19.639 --> 02:22.350
Don't talk to him!
If you want to talk to him,

02:22.433 --> 02:27.021
you gotta talk to me first,
and then maybe I'll relay the message.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.482
I, I didn't mean for this to happen.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.025
-Oh…

02:31.109 --> 02:33.611
She says, "This is all my fault,

02:33.695 --> 02:35.697
and now it's your turn
to punch me in the arm

02:35.780 --> 02:37.782
with a magical punchy glove thing."

02:38.616 --> 02:41.911
The Knight's Code… Being your page…

02:42.537 --> 02:44.122
All of it was a lie.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.040
Why?

02:53.923 --> 02:54.924
Alfie.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.388
It's my fault that he died.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.642
He told me to stay home
that night, but I followed him.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.855
Sir Alfie, the mages have
attacked. The Queen calls for your aid.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.816
Go, I'll meet you there. Go!

03:17.947 --> 03:19.073
Alfie!

03:19.157 --> 03:20.199
Huh?

03:21.117 --> 03:22.577
Are you going on a mission?

03:22.660 --> 03:23.620
I want to help!

03:23.703 --> 03:24.829
Lulu!

03:25.371 --> 03:27.540
Not tonight. It's too dangerous.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.583
What about you?

03:37.842 --> 03:39.344
Do you know what I named it?

03:43.306 --> 03:44.766
Luthera's Shield.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.601
But it's a sword!

03:46.684 --> 03:50.146
Yes. But its purpose is to protect you.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.734
I'll always protect you.

03:54.817 --> 03:59.489
And your mission is to stay here
and protect her until I get back.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.225
-Uh…

05:09.726 --> 05:12.020
-Ah! Woohoo!

05:27.869 --> 05:29.746
Leave my brother alone!

05:31.247 --> 05:32.915
-Lulu!

05:33.499 --> 05:34.709
-Get back!

05:34.792 --> 05:36.544
I told you not to follow me.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.963
But Alfie,
I knew you needed my help.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.595
-Alfie?

05:48.389 --> 05:50.641
No!

06:06.282 --> 06:09.869
If it wasn't for me,
my brother would still be alive.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.290
I have to fix this.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.793
I have to avenge my brother's death.

06:18.252 --> 06:21.047
Come on, you were just a kid.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.092
You're more than your mission, Blade.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.594
And you never have to lie to me.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.055
So what if you're not a knight?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.390
I'm not a Dragon Master.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.937
Now, come on.
We got some weasels to catch.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.942
You're… still going to help me?

06:43.861 --> 06:45.238
Of course I am.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.126
-Oh, we have to catch up.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.961
Not so fast!

07:42.044 --> 07:45.006
Wherever he goes, I go.

07:45.089 --> 07:49.010
This is a new rule I have,
ever since I met you.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.848
I might have an idea.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.185
Zhen?

07:57.268 --> 07:59.562
-Zhen is your idea?

07:59.645 --> 08:00.646
Trust me.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.200
-Huh?

08:13.284 --> 08:17.413
Nice try, Po,
but you're not escaping on my watch.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.833
Oh, Weimin, buddy.
You're gonna regret that.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.084
Hm?

08:26.631 --> 08:29.425
-Yeah! Oh, boy! Yeah!

08:31.344 --> 08:32.678
So long, suckers.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.473
Yeah, baby!

08:42.647 --> 08:46.400
-Ursa Major!

09:01.707 --> 09:03.668
-Whoa!
-Hold on!

09:12.009 --> 09:14.470
-Alright, push!

09:15.221 --> 09:16.681
Hand me the reins.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.766
Dad, do you even know how to drive a sled?

09:18.849 --> 09:23.437
I won the North Chinese Sled Racing
Championship three years in a row.

09:24.855 --> 09:28.484
Now get in, and hold on to your tenders.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.659
-Woohoohoo!
-Whoa!

09:49.213 --> 09:50.047
Come on!

10:08.316 --> 10:09.859
Yeah!

10:10.359 --> 10:12.862
We'll use the chicane to close the gap.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.614
I'm sorry, the chi-- What now?

10:19.243 --> 10:23.748
Now, we'll get into their slipstream
and make my move.

10:36.969 --> 10:37.970
Got you!

10:38.638 --> 10:41.766
Dad! You're… awesome!

10:45.478 --> 10:48.939
Dragon Master!
You came to save me!

10:49.023 --> 10:51.150
Oh, now I'm the Dragon Master, huh?

10:51.233 --> 10:52.777
Hand over the whip, Rukhmini.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.363
We had a deal! I leave with the whip!

10:55.446 --> 10:57.657
The whole world is doomed
if they get that whip.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.076
That sounds like
the world's problem, not mine!

11:05.498 --> 11:07.291
-Sorry about this, Weimin.
-Huh?

11:13.547 --> 11:14.382
Wait, what?

11:16.050 --> 11:18.844
-Hey! You… c-can't.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.305
I'm the Emperor!

11:21.389 --> 11:24.308
Well, that's something
you don't see every day!

11:24.392 --> 11:28.020
-Hm… Or every night.

11:28.604 --> 11:31.023
-Hey, you…

11:44.036 --> 11:47.164
Outsmarted again! Boop-de-boop--

11:50.292 --> 11:53.003
-Doop.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.423
Huh?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.731
Ugh. Mages.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.679
-Right on the arm.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.850
-Oh.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.478
Such a nice boat.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.397
Give our thanks
to the Emperor for the loan.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.567
Now then, we'll just be taking
the whip off your hands.

12:56.650 --> 12:57.735
Where's it at, eh?

13:06.660 --> 13:07.953
Ha ha!

13:08.037 --> 13:10.581
Hand over the whip, bears.

13:10.664 --> 13:14.460
No, you hand over the gauntlet, weasels.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.588
No sense making this harder on yourselves.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.424
You're both delusional.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.511
The other mages are gone.
You two are all alone.

13:23.594 --> 13:27.181
Even if you got all four, you couldn't
defeat all the knights of England.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.520
Oh, but we can.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.651
It's all right here in this scroll
that we took from the Lotus Village.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.571
-A gauntlet to move the Earth…

13:42.655 --> 13:45.449
-A whip of endless flame…

13:46.951 --> 13:50.496
-Wheels to ride the storm…

13:51.789 --> 13:54.583
-And a helmet to master the wind.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.339
The ancient warriors
created these weapons for one purpose,

14:00.422 --> 14:02.841
to trap the souls of their enemies.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.264
But once
you bring all four together,

14:08.347 --> 14:12.768
the souls inside
come out to play, play, play!

14:16.438 --> 14:19.608
Did you know about this whole
evil army of resurrected monsters thingy

14:19.692 --> 14:20.734
with the weapons?

14:20.818 --> 14:22.987
You don't think I would have mentioned it?

14:23.070 --> 14:25.447
Communication isn't exactly
your strong suit.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.826
-I'm giving you one chance, Pandy.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.411
Join me.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.501
What? Wait, what?

14:37.585 --> 14:39.461
No. No way.

14:39.545 --> 14:44.383
Not in a hundred
thousand million years would I ever,

14:44.466 --> 14:46.719
you know,
even consider possibly thinking--

14:46.802 --> 14:48.387
Yeah, yeah, got it.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.890
-Your loss! I'm a catch!

15:13.287 --> 15:14.997
Whoa! Did you see that?

15:15.831 --> 15:17.625
-Po!

15:19.293 --> 15:22.296
I've been waiting for this for 15 years.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.882
I should be thanking you.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.302
If you hadn't shown up that night,
we'd be deady, dead, dead!

15:30.846 --> 15:33.182
Our hero.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.032
Ow!

15:58.874 --> 16:00.417
Take that!

16:01.001 --> 16:02.378
-Whoo!

16:08.842 --> 16:10.094
Huh?

16:12.346 --> 16:14.515
-Do you know what you're doing?

16:14.598 --> 16:16.308
Oh, I'm getting the hang of it.

16:17.267 --> 16:21.188
Isn't it peachy to see
you two back together again?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.093
-Blade, are you okay?

16:52.553 --> 16:55.180
It's over, bears.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.976
Not so--

17:00.060 --> 17:01.645
Not so fa--

17:01.729 --> 17:03.731
-Where is it?
-Looking for this?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.528
Blade, we gotta go.

17:10.821 --> 17:11.655
No.

17:12.948 --> 17:17.161
Uh… Two magical weapons.
No magical weapons.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.913
Maybe I'm not more than my mission.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.797
-Blade!

17:35.012 --> 17:37.848
Okay, think, Po.
What do we do? What do we do?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.309
-Okay.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.644
I'll come with you, Veruca.

17:42.728 --> 17:43.812
My…

17:43.896 --> 17:44.855
l-love…

17:48.067 --> 17:49.860
But you gotta leave Blade alone.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.907
Ah, offer's off the table, got it.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.584
-Hm.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.303
That's my whip.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.266
Not anymore.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.522
No!

18:40.953 --> 18:41.787
No!

19:07.938 --> 19:10.107
You can't be serious.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.277
Blade!

19:22.661 --> 19:23.745
Let go!

19:23.829 --> 19:25.455
I can't!

19:26.373 --> 19:29.668
Black Steel of the Equinox!

19:58.614 --> 20:00.365
You let them get away.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.077
-I had to. I couldn't let them--

20:06.330 --> 20:08.248
-Oh…

20:17.633 --> 20:18.467
Thank you.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.888
You would have done the same for me.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.141
No. For being my friend.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.018
My first friend.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.648
And I shouldn't have lied to you.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.860
You're making water come out of my eyes.

20:43.659 --> 20:47.746
We don't know where they're headed,
and we have no weapon that can match them.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.082
Uh, not quite true!

20:55.629 --> 20:56.672
How did you--

20:56.755 --> 20:59.424
If you have the whip, what do they have?

20:59.508 --> 21:01.093
Always good to have a fake.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.053
-You switched it out?

21:03.553 --> 21:07.266
So what, you want to help us now?

21:07.349 --> 21:08.725
I didn't say that.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.144
But, we are after the same things.

21:11.228 --> 21:15.899
The whip was supposed to be the first
on my hunt for all four Tianshang Weapons.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.442
-But now--
-Uh, no, no, no.

21:17.526 --> 21:21.071
If you wanna say something to my son,
you say it to me first,

21:21.154 --> 21:24.241
and then maybe I'll tell him.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.742
Same goes for you, still.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.369
We aren't done.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.455
Dad, it's okay.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.208
You know how to find the other weapons?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.919
It may cost more
than you're willing to pay.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.754
Hm, sounds promising.

21:37.838 --> 21:41.508
Uh, too bad we're heading home.
We're late for the dinner rush.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.510
I have to go, Dad.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.637
You heard Klaus and Veruca.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.722
If we don't stop them,

21:46.805 --> 21:49.599
they're gonna resurrect the evil army
and take over the world.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.603
So if that means
I have to trust a fake knight…

21:53.687 --> 21:54.646
Seems a bit harsh.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.692
-And a con artist slash thief…
-Master con artist slash thief.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.903
Then that's what I have to do.

22:07.826 --> 22:08.994
Then I'm coming with you.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.078
I'm sorry, what?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.456
Stay out of this, Meandering Knife.

22:12.539 --> 22:16.376
I'm not gonna let you do this alone,
with the two of them.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.005
You clearly need someone to protect you,

22:20.088 --> 22:22.424
and that's always been my job.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.305
Then we're off on a treasure hunt.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.687
And that means we're leaving China.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.777
Wait, what?
