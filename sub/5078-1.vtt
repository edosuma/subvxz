02:34.910 --> 02:39.910
That's the ugliest thing
I've ever seen in my whole life.

02:42.070 --> 02:44.550
It certainly is.
Who sent it?

02:45.670 --> 02:49.350
That's strange, it doesn't say.
Who could've come from?

02:49.790 --> 02:53.270
I don't like it.
It's staring at me.

02:53.670 --> 02:55.790
It's probably one of
your uncle's jokes.

02:55.990 --> 02:57.750
I don't think it's funny
at all.

03:46.270 --> 03:48.670
<i>Darling, I'm just going
to have a shower.</i>

03:48.870 --> 03:51.030
<i>I'll be there in a minute.</i>

04:25.390 --> 04:29.670
Claudia, I told you not to leave
your toys laying about.

04:32.950 --> 04:35.870
Good God, you are hideous.

04:36.550 --> 04:38.830
<i>- Claudia?
- What?</i>

04:39.030 --> 04:40.910
I had a bond with you,
young lady.

04:41.270 --> 04:44.790
We had an agreement, didn't we?
Didn't we?

04:44.950 --> 04:46.750
<i>But daddy, I didn't
leave it there.</i>

04:46.870 --> 04:50.190
In a civilized society,
our word is our bond.

04:50.430 --> 04:52.710
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

04:52.870 --> 04:56.230
Just because it's your birthday,
doesn't mean you can...

05:27.150 --> 05:28.350
Richard?

05:29.390 --> 05:31.230
Richard, what was that?

07:03.990 --> 07:06.710
You killed my mommy and daddy.

07:09.870 --> 07:13.390
And now you're pissing your pants,
you're pissing your pants...

07:13.510 --> 07:15.390
your pissing your pants!

07:18.350 --> 07:20.870
Wake up!
You're pissing your pants!

07:22.270 --> 07:26.110
<i>And now,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

07:26.550 --> 07:29.390
<i>what you've all
been waiting for!</i>

07:29.910 --> 07:31.630
<i>Shitface...</i>

07:31.830 --> 07:35.950
<i>and the greatest ventriloquist
in Europe!</i>

07:36.230 --> 07:39.550
<i>The psychotic Psychs!</i>

07:46.550 --> 07:47.830
<i>Come on!</i>

07:54.030 --> 07:56.390
This grotesque abomination...

07:57.070 --> 08:00.550
is not even anatomically correct.

08:02.310 --> 08:05.750
Don't laugh,
it's a serious condition.

08:06.870 --> 08:10.190
Six years ago, I found him in
a cemetery back in the US...

08:10.310 --> 08:14.310
the little fucker tried
to rip me from hell.

08:14.470 --> 08:17.270
I was trying to give you
a hug.

08:22.910 --> 08:24.870
<i>I don't know much
about myself.</i>

08:26.070 --> 08:29.470
<i>I know I'm an orphan,
I know I'm a freak...</i>

08:29.990 --> 08:32.750
<i>and of course,
I know that I'm Japanese.</i>

08:33.390 --> 08:36.870
<i>But why do I have such
terrible nightmares?</i>

08:37.470 --> 08:40.789
<i>Filled with rate and
blood and guts.</i>

08:41.830 --> 08:43.830
<i>I'm not like that at all.</i>

08:44.750 --> 08:46.910
<i>I would even hurt a fly.</i>

08:47.310 --> 08:50.430
<i>There it goes,
back to his family.</i>

08:51.110 --> 08:52.630
<i>I envy him.</i>

08:53.390 --> 08:56.430
<i>Sometimes, I wonder about
my own parents.</i>

08:57.110 --> 08:58.870
<i>Were they Zen masters?</i>

08:59.110 --> 09:00.990
<i>Did they serve the emperor?</i>

09:01.270 --> 09:05.230
<i>Sometimes I wonder what my mom
and dad were really like.</i>

09:12.070 --> 09:15.190
So, you don't believe
in Santa Claus.

09:15.670 --> 09:19.550
Trust me honey, tonight
I'm gonna make you believe.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.830
Wait to see what Santa is bringing
you, you naughty girl.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.310
No, I can hear you fine,
you're not breaking up.

09:26.790 --> 09:28.790
Sheila I just said,
you're not breaking up.

09:33.150 --> 09:35.390
You're breaking up with me?

09:36.230 --> 09:39.630
Wait! You're breaking up
with me on Christmas's Eve?

09:39.950 --> 09:43.790
Sheila, you've got to be
fucking kidding me!

09:45.950 --> 09:48.030
That's just great.

10:54.550 --> 10:55.990
I knew it!

10:57.190 --> 10:59.190
You're not real!

11:05.510 --> 11:07.510
You were never real!

11:07.870 --> 11:11.350
You know what that kind of
disappointment can do to somebody?

11:11.630 --> 11:17.150
You have any idea how that
can fuck with your mind?

11:17.310 --> 11:21.310
Fuck with your mind?
Fuck with your mind?

11:21.470 --> 11:26.710
Fuck with your mind?
Fuck with your mind?

11:26.830 --> 11:30.310
Chucky broke again.
This is bloody ridiculous!

11:30.550 --> 11:32.510
Cut! Cut!

11:33.790 --> 11:35.470
<i>Thirty-four, take 1.</i>

11:36.630 --> 11:39.110
- Don't help me.
- Tony, what was that?

11:39.190 --> 11:41.670
- I'm sorry, it's...
- This is unprofessional...

11:41.710 --> 11:45.110
- and I can't work like this.
- No Jason, I'm sorry! Wait!

11:45.270 --> 11:47.910
We're here in Hollywood
where production is underway...

11:48.030 --> 11:50.590
on the new horror flick
"Chucky Goes Psycho".

11:50.790 --> 11:53.790
The film tell the urban legend
of Chucky and Tiffany.

11:53.990 --> 11:57.110
Two dolls supposedly possessed
by serial killers.

11:57.310 --> 11:59.990
The dolls were found in the scene
of real life murders...

12:00.110 --> 12:02.070
which remain unsolved
to this day.

12:05.630 --> 12:08.630
Guys, I think Tiffany's
left arm is loose again.

12:12.070 --> 12:16.190
I'm looking for Jennifer?
Does anyone have a 20 on Jennifer?

12:25.030 --> 12:27.910
Jennifer.
Got your skinny-quick.

12:29.230 --> 12:30.750
We're ready for you on set.

12:32.390 --> 12:35.750
- Jennifer, I'm so proud of you.
- For what?

12:36.030 --> 12:40.230
- For sticking to your diet.
- Thank you.

12:46.230 --> 12:48.230
What's going on
in the world today?

12:49.470 --> 12:52.430
Julia Roberts is getting 25
million for her next film.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.510
I'm so tired of hearing
about Julia Roberts.

12:55.670 --> 12:58.030
You know, I should've
played Erin Brockovich.

12:58.150 --> 12:59.950
I could've done it
without the WonderBra.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.470
Julia stole that part right
out from under me.

13:02.590 --> 13:05.870
You know how? She slept with the
director, that's what I think.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.390
Jennifer, you know
that's not true.

13:08.550 --> 13:11.190
How come I don't ever get
any of the good roles anymore?

13:11.310 --> 13:13.870
How come nobody
takes me seriously?

13:14.190 --> 13:16.470
- Nice tits.
- Thank you.

13:18.350 --> 13:20.830
Look at me, I'm an Oscar nominee,
for Christ's sake...

13:20.910 --> 13:22.630
and now I'm fucking a puppet.

13:22.710 --> 13:26.390
Got no fan mail,
no paparazzi, no stalkers.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.910
There must be something
I'm right for.

13:29.590 --> 13:31.070
Let's see...

13:33.230 --> 13:36.230
Hip Hop Superstar,
turned director Redman...

13:36.630 --> 13:39.510
is still looking for the right
actress to take the female lead...

13:39.630 --> 13:41.790
in his upcoming Bible epic.

13:41.790 --> 13:44.470
That sounds good.
What's the role?

13:46.790 --> 13:48.270
Virgin Mary.

13:48.710 --> 13:51.110
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.950
It's perfect! It's just what I need
to reinvent myself.

13:55.110 --> 13:58.910
The Virgin Mary. I always loved
the way she wears robes...

13:58.950 --> 14:01.990
her hair off her face,
kinda like this.

14:02.110 --> 14:04.390
Joan, get Morty on the phone...

14:04.630 --> 14:08.590
and tell him I need to have a meeting
with this Redman right away.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.990
<i>That's a wrap for Access Hollywood
reporting from Hollywood.</i>

14:13.190 --> 14:16.510
<i>For as you can see, Chucky
and Tiffany are alive and well.</i>

14:16.670 --> 14:19.750
<i>You can catch their movie in
theaters next Halloween.</i>

14:20.110 --> 14:21.390
<i>Thank you, Chucky.</i>

14:22.310 --> 14:24.110
<i>Fuck you very much.</i>

14:31.590 --> 14:33.950
I'm not orphan after all.

14:36.670 --> 14:37.830
Well...

14:38.670 --> 14:41.350
you were shit last night...

14:41.510 --> 14:46.030
- you're gonna have to be more scary.
- Scary?

14:49.310 --> 14:52.190
Let's rehearse, shall we?

15:08.630 --> 15:09.950
Hello.

15:13.590 --> 15:17.990
Look, you gotta learn tapping
your killer instincts.

15:18.070 --> 15:22.590
Give in to your natural
impulses, or else I'll have to...

15:25.190 --> 15:26.590
fire your arm?

15:33.350 --> 15:34.350
Hey!

15:40.150 --> 15:43.830
Come here! Come here!

15:55.030 --> 15:56.790
Come here!

16:46.750 --> 16:50.430
Mary, you're truly a vision
of solid innocence.

16:50.670 --> 16:54.310
Unique among all women,
as pure as the virgin snow...

16:54.510 --> 16:56.750
but I ask,
what is troubling you?

16:56.870 --> 17:00.950
Joseph, husband,
there's been a miracle.

17:01.190 --> 17:04.430
As I stand before you,
I must tell you...

17:04.829 --> 17:06.710
I'm with child.

17:06.990 --> 17:08.869
But Mary, how could this be?

17:09.310 --> 17:11.829
In accordance with God's whishes,
we never lay together...

17:12.270 --> 17:14.670
as man and wife.

17:14.790 --> 17:19.630
Yes it is true, and I beg you
that you believe when I tell you...

17:19.829 --> 17:22.589
I've never lain with
any man at all.

17:23.150 --> 17:26.270
Do you believe me, Joseph?
Do you?

17:27.750 --> 17:30.390
- Do you?
- Yes, yes I do.

17:31.870 --> 17:35.550
- You're great. You're super.
- Thank you, Mr. Man.

17:35.670 --> 17:37.510
Could I call you Red?

17:37.750 --> 17:40.870
There's a whole lot different ways
I can do it, not just the way you saw.

17:41.270 --> 17:46.430
I can do it faster, I can do it
slower, I could do it as a rap.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.670
No.

17:48.870 --> 17:52.510
You already showed me a side of the
character I've never seen before.

17:52.630 --> 17:53.750
Thank you.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.910
But I think I'm gonna have
to go with my first choice.

17:57.470 --> 17:59.510
Thanks for coming by anyway.

17:59.670 --> 18:01.870
I'm a huge, huge fan...

18:01.950 --> 18:04.030
I really wanna work with you
one day, we should call you...

18:04.150 --> 18:07.150
Excuse me, I hope you don't
mind my asking but...

18:07.550 --> 18:10.750
- who is your first choice?
- Julia Roberts.

18:11.150 --> 18:12.590
But thanks for
coming by anyways.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.910
Listen Red...

18:15.710 --> 18:19.270
I've been giving a lot
of thought to this project...

18:19.430 --> 18:22.710
and I have a lot of interesting
ideas about the character...

18:23.110 --> 18:24.550
and I was thinking maybe...

18:24.750 --> 18:31.310
you'd like to discuss it in a more
intimate setting. Just the 2 of us.

18:32.390 --> 18:36.790
Well, I didn't know you were that
passionate about the role.

18:37.030 --> 18:40.670
Yes, very passionate.

18:42.150 --> 18:46.430
So, shall we say, my place...

18:48.390 --> 18:50.110
eight 'o clock?

19:21.470 --> 19:22.510
Pardon me, sir.

19:27.310 --> 19:28.230
Sorry.

19:30.150 --> 19:31.790
Sorry, sir.

19:33.150 --> 19:36.630
Don't mind me.
Excuse me.

19:38.710 --> 19:39.870
Oh dear.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.270
Mom?

20:03.990 --> 20:05.230
Dad?

20:05.470 --> 20:07.830
I've dreamed of this moment
all my life.

20:08.350 --> 20:11.230
I know this must come
as quite a shock.

20:12.070 --> 20:14.230
It's going to be an
adjustment for all of us.

20:17.990 --> 20:20.910
Look, I still have the
necklace you left me.

20:21.510 --> 20:24.470
I've always wanted to know,
what does this words mean?

20:25.070 --> 20:26.750
Is it our family motto?

20:28.070 --> 20:29.750
Please say something!

20:31.710 --> 20:34.670
It's because of the way
I look, isn't it?

20:36.310 --> 20:40.190
For pity's sake,
please wake up!

20:42.350 --> 20:44.070
Wake up.

20:46.390 --> 20:51.110
"Aguei Due Dambala. Awake!"

21:26.030 --> 21:29.110
- Tiff?
- Chucky?

21:32.110 --> 21:34.390
Who the hell are you?

21:34.990 --> 21:36.190
Shitface.

21:38.710 --> 21:40.990
Now what kind of a name
is that?

21:41.110 --> 21:43.150
Where are you mother
and father?

21:43.470 --> 21:46.430
Checking from that face,
my guess is they're hiding.

21:46.590 --> 21:48.470
Shut up, you asshole.

21:48.670 --> 21:51.470
Come on, it looks like the kid
fell off the ugly tree...

21:51.590 --> 21:53.950
and hit every branch
on the way down.

21:57.070 --> 22:00.990
You gotta feel bad for the parents.
I wonder what they must look like.

22:09.270 --> 22:11.630
Oh my God.

22:23.670 --> 22:27.750
What? No you didn't...
we didn't...

22:29.910 --> 22:33.510
Sweet Face, come to mommy!

22:43.910 --> 22:47.630
What's going on?
Where are we?

22:47.910 --> 22:50.990
In Hollywood.
I saw you on the TV.

22:51.350 --> 22:54.910
Chucky, wake up!
Look at us!

22:55.150 --> 22:59.350
We've had a make over!
We're movie stars!

23:01.830 --> 23:04.310
Shit! Barbie mode!

23:04.430 --> 23:08.190
They're puppets. They don't
walk and talk by themselves.

23:08.710 --> 23:12.790
Listen, if you want them to work,
I'm gonna have to take them apart.

23:33.030 --> 23:34.550
Is mommy ill?

23:35.150 --> 23:36.830
The courts thought so.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.230
Heads up!

24:28.430 --> 24:30.390
I'll stop believing that.

24:49.910 --> 24:52.470
Hey, you're pissing your pants.

24:52.830 --> 24:55.670
Chucky, she's just had
an accident.

24:56.790 --> 25:00.470
You mean "he" had an accident.

25:04.110 --> 25:05.310
Don't look at me.

25:14.870 --> 25:18.030
See? What did I tell you?

25:18.270 --> 25:23.030
- A beautiful little girl.
- What? Are you blind?

25:23.150 --> 25:24.750
That's my boy!

25:26.190 --> 25:29.670
It's just that he hasn't had
his growth spurt yet.

25:29.990 --> 25:34.350
Don't worry about it, son.
You're a later bloomer, that's all.

25:34.510 --> 25:36.910
And it's high time
that you had a real name.

25:37.350 --> 25:40.830
Let's see, I'm gonna call you...

25:42.790 --> 25:43.910
Glen.

25:44.990 --> 25:48.670
Glen? What kind of name
is that for a girl?

25:48.830 --> 25:53.350
Don't listen to him, honey.
From now on, your name is...

25:54.030 --> 25:55.230
Glenda.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.070
Run, Glenda!

26:11.750 --> 26:13.710
Geez! What a mess!

26:21.830 --> 26:24.190
There you are, mister good bar.

26:41.590 --> 26:44.910
<i>Jennifer Tilly!</i>

26:59.350 --> 27:00.510
Hello!

27:06.870 --> 27:09.950
Oh my God!
You look so real.

27:11.190 --> 27:12.910
You look so real!

27:15.670 --> 27:18.110
You're cuter than
my last boyfriend.

27:18.510 --> 27:20.390
I think we make
a lovely couple.

27:36.950 --> 27:39.790
Jennifer! Mrs. Tilly!
Were you having an affair with him?

27:39.950 --> 27:41.750
I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:43.070 --> 27:44.670
Pete Peters,
Celebrities Reveal.

27:44.870 --> 27:47.630
- Jennifer, what did you see?
- You want me to draw a picture?

27:47.710 --> 27:51.870
- Somebody give her a piece of paper!
- I'm not going to draw a picture.

27:51.950 --> 27:54.510
Don't feel bad, you're an
actress, not an artist, uh?

27:54.590 --> 27:56.150
What were you doing
when you saw the body?

27:57.030 --> 27:58.190
No comments.

27:58.590 --> 28:00.670
Jennifer, I love you.

28:02.190 --> 28:04.310
Jennifer, I love you.

28:07.350 --> 28:08.830
Is it true that you and
Redman talked about...

28:08.950 --> 28:10.590
you starring in his
new movie?

28:12.390 --> 28:15.830
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I...
- Can I have your autograph?

28:17.030 --> 28:18.470
Okay, sure.

28:19.470 --> 28:21.750
<i>We've heard about
your obsession with chocolate.</i>

28:29.590 --> 28:32.350
Hey, hold on,
you forgot the head.

28:32.390 --> 28:33.110
Excuse me, excuse me.

28:33.110 --> 28:33.830
<i>Jennifer, how old
are you really?</i>

28:33.910 --> 28:37.590
<i>- Paparazzi scum bag!
- What year were you born?</i>

28:37.710 --> 28:40.030
- I want the set of the film, okay?
- Sure.

28:42.190 --> 28:44.750
<i>What are you hiding?</i>

28:48.790 --> 28:53.070
- Are you okay?
- I am now.

29:10.030 --> 29:13.430
So are you a pair
of ninja assassins?

29:15.030 --> 29:17.390
Are you hit men for the Yakuza?

29:17.510 --> 29:20.990
We're not from Japan.
We're from Jersey.

29:21.310 --> 29:25.390
Just think. Jennifer Tilly
is playing me in a movie.

29:25.590 --> 29:29.230
- It's absolutely perfect casting.
- But that voice?

29:29.470 --> 29:33.550
I know, she sounds
just like an angel.

29:33.990 --> 29:36.110
Now I've got it all
figured it out.

29:36.550 --> 29:38.550
I'm gonna transfer my soul
into Jennifer...

29:38.710 --> 29:41.550
and you're gonna transfer your
soul into Redman.

29:41.750 --> 29:42.990
I'm down with that.

29:43.150 --> 29:45.670
We'll diss these plastic bodies
once and for all...

29:45.830 --> 29:48.310
and we'll be Hollywood's
hottest couple!

29:48.590 --> 29:50.910
- What about me?
- Don't worry, Glenda.

29:51.070 --> 29:53.030
I've got that
figured it out too.

29:53.270 --> 29:56.390
You are going to be
a real life girl.

29:56.470 --> 29:58.070
- Boy.
- How?

29:58.270 --> 30:02.350
Well, I'm not getting pregnant
again, I'll tell you that much.

30:02.550 --> 30:03.990
My mother always told me...

30:04.270 --> 30:07.110
"once is a blessing,
twice is a curse. "

30:07.350 --> 30:09.470
That would explain your sister.

30:09.630 --> 30:12.990
The only sensible option
is a surrogate mother.

30:24.470 --> 30:28.070
- I have something important...
- Hold on a second, sweetheart.

30:32.670 --> 30:34.910
<i>- Hello?
- What are you doing?</i>

30:35.070 --> 30:36.310
I'm busy.

30:38.190 --> 30:41.790
<i>- I do have a life, you know?
- Turn on the news.</i>

30:44.630 --> 30:46.630
<i>We have discovered
the victim's body.</i>

30:46.790 --> 30:49.270
<i>As of yet there's no
official confirmation...</i>

30:49.390 --> 30:51.870
<i>as to whether or not
Mrs. Tilly is a suspect</i>

30:52.030 --> 30:53.870
<i>- Jesus!
- Can you believe it?</i>

30:54.030 --> 30:55.310
Are you okay?

30:56.430 --> 30:58.110
I've had better days.

30:58.470 --> 31:00.190
Listen Joan, I need you
to do something for me.

31:00.270 --> 31:02.150
I need you to get me
a bottle of champagne...

31:02.390 --> 31:03.870
and bring it by my house.

31:04.510 --> 31:05.630
<i>What for?</i>

31:08.950 --> 31:10.590
I've got a big night tonight.

31:10.750 --> 31:13.070
<i>Tonight? With who?</i>

31:13.870 --> 31:15.030
Redman.

31:17.350 --> 31:20.750
- Jennifer, what are you up to?
- Thank you, Joan.

31:24.590 --> 31:29.190
Come on, Stan. It's just business.
He'll be outta there by midnight.

31:33.510 --> 31:37.270
Oh my God!
She's a complete slut!

31:54.070 --> 31:56.790
Good night, Glenda.
Sleep tight.

31:58.110 --> 31:59.150
Leave it on.

32:00.590 --> 32:04.030
Oh sweetie.
There's nothing to be scared of.

32:04.350 --> 32:06.670
Your dad and I will be
right here.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.110
Why do you kill people?

32:14.510 --> 32:15.670
Excuse me?

32:16.550 --> 32:18.030
Why do you kill?

32:22.350 --> 32:25.510
It's a hobby, really.
It helps us relax.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.350
Am I going to be a killer?

32:27.430 --> 32:31.150
Of course! It's been a family
tradition for generations!

32:31.430 --> 32:35.270
But violence is bad, isn't it?
They said so on TV.

32:35.550 --> 32:40.470
Not violence. Violins.
Violins are bad.

32:40.670 --> 32:43.630
That scrutchy music is gonna
ruin the godamn country.

32:44.310 --> 32:45.830
Chucky, Glenda is right.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.950
It's time we owned up to it.

32:48.110 --> 32:50.830
We have a problem with killing.

32:51.030 --> 32:54.270
I don't have a "problem"
with killing.

32:54.590 --> 32:58.350
I like a little killing now and
then. What's wrong with that?

32:58.510 --> 33:02.190
Killing is an addiction
like any other drug.

33:02.430 --> 33:06.670
But we're parents now.
We have to set a good example.

33:08.630 --> 33:12.470
Let's quit, Chucky.
Right now!

33:12.910 --> 33:14.990
You have got to be kidding.

33:15.350 --> 33:17.590
Promise me, Chucky,
no more killing.

33:17.710 --> 33:18.710
- No.
- Chucky.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.910
- No, no...
- No more killing!

33:21.030 --> 33:22.430
- No, no...
- We can't do it anymore!

33:22.510 --> 33:24.190
- No, no...
- We have the future to think of!

33:24.350 --> 33:25.750
- No, no!
- We have a child!

33:25.870 --> 33:29.870
Fine! Alright already!
I promise.

33:30.870 --> 33:33.950
Thank you, doll baby.
You're a sweetheart.

33:34.110 --> 33:37.550
Now we really will be
the perfect family.

33:45.270 --> 33:46.350
Did you hear that?

33:46.910 --> 33:50.230
Maybe you should forget the director
and fuck the exterminator instead.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.630
So how do I look? Never mind.

33:54.910 --> 33:57.190
Jennifer, this is beneath you.

33:57.550 --> 34:00.630
Think about what you're doing.
What the people are gonna say?

34:00.750 --> 34:02.750
Who cares what people will say?

34:03.350 --> 34:06.710
- Don't you see how evil this is?
- I don't wanna hear it.

34:07.030 --> 34:10.389
You're prostituting yourself
so you can play the Virgin Mary.

34:10.710 --> 34:12.630
Joan, I don't wanna hear it.

34:13.310 --> 34:16.230
This is so evil.
You're going to hell.

34:16.350 --> 34:19.389
No, hell would be ending up
on "Celebrity Fear Factor"...

34:19.510 --> 34:22.469
in a worm-eating contest
with Ann and Nicole Smith.

34:23.389 --> 34:24.989
Which you'd win.

34:29.949 --> 34:33.270
- He's here.
- Let yourself out the back.

34:34.989 --> 34:37.909
And while you're at it,
leave your key on the counter.

34:38.710 --> 34:42.590
- What are you saying?
- You think I'm so disgusting...

34:42.790 --> 34:44.630
you think I'm going to hell.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.350
I'm only trying
to survive here, Joan.

34:47.469 --> 34:49.710
God knows I wouldn't wanna
drag you down with me.

34:50.550 --> 34:52.230
I'm saying you're fired.

35:05.950 --> 35:08.830
I'm gonna get that ass...

35:15.870 --> 35:19.590
Now in artificial insemination,
timing is everything...

35:19.670 --> 35:23.150
so you have to hurry. That
shouldn't be a problem for you.

35:23.710 --> 35:27.070
Yeah, just don't let that player
get into her pants.

35:27.270 --> 35:29.070
I don't want him touching
my woman...

35:29.190 --> 35:31.670
- until I'm him, and you're her.
- Right.

35:37.750 --> 35:41.430
Hey, aren't you gonna give me
a hand here?

35:55.630 --> 35:57.190
Too tall.

35:58.550 --> 36:00.030
Lesbos!

36:03.270 --> 36:04.230
Done her.

36:09.030 --> 36:10.950
Here we go!

36:12.070 --> 36:14.750
Come to papa!

36:56.750 --> 36:57.990
Cheers!

36:59.390 --> 37:03.070
You know, I wasn't bullshitting
when I told you I was a fan.

37:03.230 --> 37:05.390
That's so sweet, Redman.

37:05.750 --> 37:07.710
Which of my films
is your favorite?

37:07.870 --> 37:10.070
That movie where you and
that chick were making out.

37:10.230 --> 37:13.830
"Bound".
Everybody likes that one.

37:13.910 --> 37:15.790
- You're still in touch with her?
- Gina?

37:15.950 --> 37:17.630
Yeah, we're friends.

37:18.310 --> 37:19.350
Close friends.

37:20.310 --> 37:22.230
Very close friends.

37:22.950 --> 37:26.950
Maybe the three of us
can hang out together sometime.

37:28.390 --> 37:31.750
- I'd really like that a lot.
- Okay.

37:32.190 --> 37:35.350
- I'll see if I can make it happen.
- The bottom is up, baby.

37:37.150 --> 37:40.590
Redman, I was wondering...

37:41.310 --> 37:44.230
what's gonna take to make you
seem me as a Virgin?

37:45.110 --> 37:47.150
Well, you tell me!

38:20.470 --> 38:22.470
A masturbating midget?

38:30.590 --> 38:32.270
Get it, Mini-Me!

38:46.990 --> 38:49.830
Sweet Jesus!
God bless the little people!

38:53.710 --> 38:56.750
- I don't know if I can do this?
- Why not?

38:58.030 --> 39:01.470
- What will people say?
- Fuck what people will say!

39:01.630 --> 39:04.190
You know what I'm saying?
This was meant to be, for real.

39:04.550 --> 39:07.550
You know how I know? 'Cause
the man upstairs told me so.

39:07.870 --> 39:09.710
- Really?
- Hell yeah!

39:09.990 --> 39:14.150
Mel Gibson ain't the only one God's
been talking to in Hollywood.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.870
And He personally told me,
that you was my Virgin.

39:24.910 --> 39:26.430
What the hell?

39:33.510 --> 39:34.510
Pig!

39:35.510 --> 39:39.630
And you should be
ashamed yourself.

39:39.790 --> 39:42.110
Where's your self-respect?

39:42.390 --> 39:45.670
You know what my mother
used to say about dirty girls?

39:46.030 --> 39:51.910
She said "You can always smell
it on the girls who sell it".

39:52.870 --> 39:55.990
By the way, can I have
your autograph?

39:56.070 --> 39:57.630
I'm a big fan.

40:04.630 --> 40:06.710
What am I supposed to do
with this?

40:21.990 --> 40:24.910
Mrs. Tilly, I know
you're frightened.

40:25.030 --> 40:28.630
You're probably even wondering
if you've gone completely insane.

40:28.950 --> 40:31.830
But I promise you, tomorrow
you're going to wake up...

40:31.910 --> 40:34.350
and this will all seem
just like a bad dream.

40:34.990 --> 40:36.110
In the mean time...

40:36.310 --> 40:41.150
we can do this the easy way,
or the hard way.

40:42.630 --> 40:44.670
It's really up to you.

40:52.230 --> 40:54.590
No wonder the girl
is always in trouble.

40:58.870 --> 41:02.430
Check it out.
Look at the size of his feet.

41:03.190 --> 41:04.710
You know what they say.

41:06.110 --> 41:07.550
Geez, she's fat.

41:08.790 --> 41:11.470
I can't believe it, she's not
even pregnant yet.

41:18.150 --> 41:19.830
Paparazzi scum bag!

41:29.910 --> 41:31.830
Looks like you've got
everything under control.

41:31.910 --> 41:33.750
I'll just leave you to it.

41:39.430 --> 41:42.710
Motherhood is so beautiful.

41:49.550 --> 41:52.790
No, no...

42:05.870 --> 42:08.790
Sorry, just messing with you.

42:09.070 --> 42:10.430
What time is it?

42:13.710 --> 42:15.710
Time to get dressed.

42:16.510 --> 42:20.670
We're gonna have our own boys'
night out, just you and me.

42:20.790 --> 42:23.430
- How does that sound?
- Where are we going?

42:24.030 --> 42:25.550
Hunting.

42:32.670 --> 42:36.950
I can't see anything.
Maybe we should slow down?

42:37.110 --> 42:39.350
Now, you're doing great!

42:48.070 --> 42:49.870
Son of a bitch!

42:52.750 --> 42:55.270
- Up yours, asshole!
- What?

42:55.510 --> 42:58.430
Not you, son.
Come on, floor it!

43:14.710 --> 43:16.950
<i>Ops! I did it again!</i>

44:04.230 --> 44:06.390
Jesus Christ!

44:47.510 --> 44:49.870
No!

45:13.390 --> 45:16.830
- Oughta a boy!
- No, I didn't...

45:16.950 --> 45:19.550
And I thought you
weren't ready, kid!

45:19.710 --> 45:22.190
You're a fucking natural!

45:22.590 --> 45:24.390
But he hit the shelf!

45:24.830 --> 45:27.750
And don't worry about your
mother, it'll be our little secret.

45:34.350 --> 45:36.830
Say "cheese".

45:58.430 --> 45:59.430
Good morning.

46:00.910 --> 46:02.110
Hi.

46:03.190 --> 46:05.590
We must have really gotten
wild last night.

46:07.670 --> 46:09.590
Redman, did we...?

46:10.630 --> 46:13.990
- You don't remember?
- No, it's all blur.

46:15.270 --> 46:18.990
- What about you?
- I remember you screaming a lot.

46:19.830 --> 46:22.070
I seem to remember that too.

46:22.190 --> 46:24.950
I have that effect on women.

46:25.750 --> 46:27.670
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:29.550 --> 46:32.990
Wait, I do remember.

46:33.950 --> 46:35.950
I had the strangest dream.

46:36.710 --> 46:39.270
I dreamt my guardian angel
came to me.

46:40.070 --> 46:43.310
She had the sweetest voice
I've ever heard.

46:43.870 --> 46:46.150
She told me
to respect myself...

46:47.550 --> 46:49.630
and then she asked for
my autograph.

46:50.790 --> 46:54.870
Let' see, step number one,
admit I have an addiction.

46:55.190 --> 46:56.790
Okay, check.

46:56.950 --> 47:01.190
Step number two, give myself
over to a higher power?

47:01.790 --> 47:02.870
Whatever.

47:07.670 --> 47:08.950
Here we go.

47:09.190 --> 47:13.470
Step number nine:
The recovering addict...

47:13.550 --> 47:18.190
must make amendments to anyone
he or she has harmed.

47:29.230 --> 47:32.870
<i>- Hello?
- Good morning. Is this Ruth Bailey?</i>

47:32.990 --> 47:35.750
<i>- Speaking.
- The widow of Robert Bailey?</i>

47:36.230 --> 47:39.110
<i>- Yes, who is this?
- Mrs. Bailey...</i>

47:39.310 --> 47:41.270
my name's Tiffany Ray.

47:41.670 --> 47:45.190
You don't know me, but a few
years ago I killed your husband.

47:45.310 --> 47:48.710
And I'm so very sorry.

47:48.870 --> 47:50.950
<i>Is this some kind of sick joke?</i>

47:51.110 --> 47:54.270
No, I'm completely serious.

47:54.350 --> 47:55.830
But I want you to know...

47:55.950 --> 48:00.270
I'm recovering now and
I've put all of that behind me.

48:00.390 --> 48:03.910
<i>I don't know who you are,
but...</i>

48:04.230 --> 48:07.630
Thank you Mrs. Bailey,
have a nice day.

48:10.270 --> 48:12.030
I feel better already.

48:26.830 --> 48:28.190
Good morning, Stan.

48:29.270 --> 48:31.750
What is so important
you wanted to tell me?

48:33.510 --> 48:37.590
Well, the things is, Jennifer...

48:43.830 --> 48:47.070
I'm sorry, I don't know
what's got into me.

48:49.270 --> 48:50.670
So you were saying...

48:52.710 --> 48:55.470
- Forget it.
- Okay.

48:58.790 --> 49:01.790
Now, let's see...

49:02.310 --> 49:05.270
what should we do today?

49:31.030 --> 49:32.310
I'm pregnant.

49:34.950 --> 49:37.430
Redman, I said I'm pregnant.

49:38.750 --> 49:40.790
Congratulations.
Who's the baby's daddy?

49:43.590 --> 49:44.990
Don't even look at me.

49:45.750 --> 49:47.270
I haven't slept with anyone else...

49:47.350 --> 49:49.190
to advance my career lately.

49:49.350 --> 49:52.150
- Who are you kidding?
- It's true, Redman, look.

49:53.270 --> 49:57.910
I know I come off all sluty,
but that's for my image.

49:58.310 --> 50:00.870
You think anyone would cast me
in these sexy roles...

50:01.110 --> 50:03.510
if they knew I hadn't been
laid in a year?

50:04.350 --> 50:06.710
I haven't even slept
with my driver yet...

50:07.030 --> 50:08.750
and I think he really likes me.

50:09.150 --> 50:13.070
That's all very touchy and shit,
but I'm telling you it can't be me.

50:13.590 --> 50:14.630
Why not?

50:14.910 --> 50:17.030
I had a vasectomy as soon as
I got to Hollywood.

50:17.310 --> 50:18.630
I ain't no idiot.

50:19.350 --> 50:23.430
- That's impossible, because...
- Hey, Jennifer.

50:23.830 --> 50:24.910
I hate to break it to you...

50:25.190 --> 50:27.750
but I can't hire you
if you're pregnant.

50:28.030 --> 50:31.270
That's ridiculous.
The character is pregnant.

50:31.470 --> 50:36.030
I know, but I have a very
specific vision of Mary.

50:36.270 --> 50:40.030
What can I say?
She's gotta be hot.

50:45.630 --> 50:47.630
That pig!

51:06.830 --> 51:09.310
<i>- Recovery Hotline.
- Yes, I'm in recovery.</i>

51:09.510 --> 51:12.350
And I'm afraid I'm going
to have a slip.

51:12.630 --> 51:17.110
<i>- Can you get to a meeting?
- No, it's really not an option.</i>

51:17.390 --> 51:21.470
<i>- I just freak everybody out.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.</i>

51:21.750 --> 51:23.190
<i>We're not here to judge you.
What's your name?</i>

51:23.470 --> 51:25.870
<i>- Tiffany.
- Listen to me, Tiffany.</i>

51:26.230 --> 51:29.470
<i>- I know what you're going through.
- You do?</i>

51:29.750 --> 51:33.230
<i>Yes, I do. In fact, I'm gonna
let you in a little secret.</i>

51:33.470 --> 51:35.870
<i>- Just last week I had a slip.
- Really?</i>

51:36.230 --> 51:39.590
<i>Yeah, and believe me,
it was not pretty.</i>

51:39.910 --> 51:41.990
<i>- It never is, is it?
- No.</i>

51:42.270 --> 51:45.070
<i>In fact it took me three hours
just to clean up the mess.</i>

51:45.910 --> 51:49.070
Oh God, don't remind me.

51:49.790 --> 51:51.830
<i>But I'm not beating myself
over it.</i>

51:52.030 --> 51:53.750
<i>- You know why, Tiffany?
- Why?</i>

51:54.350 --> 51:57.670
<i>Because Rome wasn't built
in a day.</i>

51:59.350 --> 52:04.470
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

52:13.710 --> 52:18.430
<i>Hello?
Speaking. Who's this?</i>

52:19.310 --> 52:24.230
<i>I understand who you are, I just
don't know how you got my number.</i>

52:24.430 --> 52:27.470
<i>Because it's a private number.</i>

52:28.750 --> 52:32.750
<i>Pete Peters?
Yeah, I saw him yesterday.</i>

52:33.710 --> 52:36.150
<i>I don't have any relationship
with him.</i>

52:36.430 --> 52:39.350
<i>He's a paparazzi who
started taking pictures of me...</i>

52:39.670 --> 52:41.350
<i>in compromising positions.</i>

52:42.350 --> 52:46.950
<i>Redman is a director...
Oh yeah...</i>

52:47.310 --> 52:53.750
<i>he's a rapper too...
he's a rapper director, okay?</i>

52:57.790 --> 52:59.030
Bye-bye.

53:02.430 --> 53:04.190
Jennifer.

53:04.510 --> 53:06.750
Do you mind?
I'm on the phone.

53:15.830 --> 53:17.550
There's been another murder.

53:17.830 --> 53:19.990
What? I told where I was.

53:20.270 --> 53:22.590
I was right here all night
with Redman.

53:23.270 --> 53:26.110
<i>What? I don't...</i>

53:26.870 --> 53:29.750
<i>You're not telling me I'm
a suspect, are you?</i>

53:31.630 --> 53:34.590
<i>Okay. Alright.
I'm on my way.</i>

53:35.510 --> 53:37.990
I'm leaving.
You can let yourself out.

53:38.230 --> 53:41.830
By the way Redman,
drop dead.

53:48.190 --> 53:54.270
Glenda, honey,
everything is okay.

53:54.550 --> 53:58.990
It was just a little slip.
No need to tell your daddy.

53:59.230 --> 54:02.630
It'll be our little secret, okay?

54:15.550 --> 54:17.910
<i>It's "D" day here
in San Quentin.</i>

54:18.190 --> 54:20.190
<i>Who would've thought
it would ever come to this?</i>

54:20.550 --> 54:23.310
They're executing Martha Stewart
this morning.

54:24.710 --> 54:28.230
I don't think I can take
nine months of this shit.

54:28.670 --> 54:34.070
Silly Chucky. It's a voodoo
pregnancy. It's accelerated.

54:34.310 --> 54:36.230
How accelerated?

54:36.510 --> 54:39.190
<i>It's 102,7 Kiss FM, LA's number
one music station.</i>

54:39.550 --> 54:43.790
<i>Ryan Seacrest, Ally Kay "I don't
know if I can't take it" on the way.</i>

54:44.070 --> 54:48.190
<i>We have bad weather on the way,
LA, Hollywood.</i>

54:48.470 --> 54:50.390
<i>Bad weather? We're not
used to bad weather.</i>

54:50.630 --> 54:52.070
<i>No, we're not.</i>

54:52.390 --> 54:55.350
<i>I'm pretty sure it's gonna
affect my whole life.</i>

54:56.870 --> 55:00.750
<i>I'd like to hear more reports
on the weather...</i>

55:14.630 --> 55:15.350
<i>This is Joan.</i>

55:15.590 --> 55:18.990
Joan, I'm fat.

55:19.270 --> 55:22.630
- You're not fat.
- No, I'm fat, I'm huge!

55:22.950 --> 55:25.190
For the love of Mary,
I'm pregnant.

55:25.430 --> 55:27.350
- Oh my God.
- No, I should've listened to you.

55:27.670 --> 55:30.390
You said it was evil
and I was going to hell.

55:30.670 --> 55:33.110
You're right and
now God is punishing me.

55:33.430 --> 55:37.550
- My God. Is it Redman's?
- No, it's definitely not Redman's.

55:37.790 --> 55:38.750
- What?
- What?

55:38.990 --> 55:41.710
It's definitely not Redman's.
What an asshole!

55:41.950 --> 55:43.870
- What makes you say that?
- Say what?

55:44.190 --> 55:47.190
- That Redman's is an asshole.
- I didn't say, you did.

55:47.390 --> 55:49.310
- No I didn't.
- So he's not an asshole?

55:49.590 --> 55:52.910
- Yes he is.
- Joan, will you stop doing that?

55:53.190 --> 55:56.190
- Doing what?
- Imitating, I don't sound like that!

55:56.430 --> 55:58.510
Yes you do! I do!

55:58.790 --> 56:04.230
Joan, shut up! There's something
wrong with me, I'm pregnant, I...

56:05.550 --> 56:07.190
Jennifer, what's wrong?

56:08.110 --> 56:10.270
Nothing, I'm fine.

56:10.550 --> 56:14.110
I heard you scream.
I can still hear you screaming.

56:15.710 --> 56:18.550
It's just, "Bound"
is on cable.

56:18.790 --> 56:21.150
Gina Gershon is fingering me.

56:22.990 --> 56:25.190
<i>I love this movie, don't you?</i>

56:27.550 --> 56:28.430
Jennifer?

56:28.630 --> 56:32.590
Yeah, that's really interesting,
but I gotta go. Bye.

56:33.790 --> 56:35.030
Jennifer?

56:37.630 --> 56:39.590
- Too tight?
- Yes.

56:40.550 --> 56:42.910
Ain't no such thing.

56:46.870 --> 56:49.910
What are you doing? Stop it!

56:50.950 --> 56:52.790
What the hell is going on
in here?

56:54.310 --> 56:56.910
She came on to me.

56:57.070 --> 57:00.110
- Help me! Somebody help me!
- Shut up, asshole!

57:01.030 --> 57:04.230
Somebody help me!

57:04.990 --> 57:06.750
Somebody help me!

57:13.590 --> 57:15.230
What the hell is this?

57:15.510 --> 57:17.350
We had an agreement, Chucky!

57:17.510 --> 57:20.070
We decided,
for the sake of our child...

57:20.150 --> 57:23.310
we weren't gonna do
this shit anymore.

57:23.430 --> 57:25.310
No, you decided!

57:25.390 --> 57:28.790
Just like you decided
our son was a girl.

57:28.910 --> 57:31.670
- He is a girl!
- He's a boy, godamn it!

57:31.790 --> 57:35.870
And he's the most promising
killer I've ever seen.

57:35.990 --> 57:37.950
You should've been there, Tiff.

57:38.070 --> 57:40.270
You would've been
so proud of him.

57:40.350 --> 57:43.270
- I want a girl!
- I want a boy!

57:43.430 --> 57:45.870
You're tearing me apart!

57:46.110 --> 57:48.710
What about what I want?

57:49.510 --> 57:50.870
- What?
- What?

57:51.030 --> 57:53.990
Doesn't what I want
mean anything at all?

57:55.750 --> 57:58.710
Okay, interesting. Tell us.

57:58.950 --> 58:01.030
What do you want, Sweet Face?

58:01.670 --> 58:05.670
I think I want to be a boy.

58:05.830 --> 58:08.990
Yes! In your face, lady!

58:09.550 --> 58:12.510
But being a girl would be
nice too.

58:14.270 --> 58:17.190
- Well, which is it?
- I'm not sure.

58:17.310 --> 58:19.070
Sometimes I feel like a boy...

58:19.510 --> 58:21.270
sometimes I feel like a girl.

58:23.150 --> 58:24.390
Can I be both?

58:24.550 --> 58:28.630
- Well, some people...
- No way!

58:28.790 --> 58:30.710
But one thing I do know
for sure.

58:31.270 --> 58:33.550
I don't want to be a killer.

58:33.790 --> 58:37.750
Glenda, Glen, whatever.

58:37.870 --> 58:39.910
I'm so proud of you.

58:39.990 --> 58:41.750
No matter what happens...

58:41.830 --> 58:45.630
we'll deal with it together,
as a family.

58:45.750 --> 58:47.230
Okay, Tiff-san.

58:48.790 --> 58:49.870
Wait a minute!

58:50.150 --> 58:52.870
I'm not gonna let you poison
our son's mind...

58:52.990 --> 58:55.870
with your touchy-feely
twelve-step bullshit.

58:56.150 --> 58:58.750
If you two don't wanna kill
anymore, that's your loss.

58:58.910 --> 59:01.950
But don't look down
your noses at me.

59:02.190 --> 59:05.750
I'm not ashamed to be a killer,
I'm proud of it.

59:06.110 --> 59:09.110
It's not an addiction,
it's a choice.

59:09.390 --> 59:13.310
And it's not something that you
should have to hide in the closet.

59:20.470 --> 59:22.990
- Oh dear!
- Oh God!

59:25.390 --> 59:27.670
Well, well, well...

59:27.750 --> 59:32.910
Looks like Ms. High and Mighty
ain't so perfect after all.

59:33.110 --> 59:34.910
It was just a little slip.

59:35.030 --> 59:37.510
Rome wasn't built in a day,
you know?

59:38.150 --> 59:40.910
Besides, the fucker
really had it coming.

59:46.670 --> 59:49.590
- And what about my body?
- I'll take care of it.

59:56.670 --> 59:59.990
Jennifer, I love you.
Jennifer, I love you.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:01.710
I love you.

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:08.550
- This is Stan.
- Hello. It's Jennifer.

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:13.510
<i>Baby, I need your body.</i>

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:16.030
I'll be right there.

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.510
Jennifer, if anything happens to
me I want you to know...

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:33.870
They really do make a cute couple,
don't you think?

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:35.590
It's like my mother
always said...

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:38.670
Christ! Enough with your
mother already!

01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:41.950
I killed that bitch twenty years
ago and she still won't shut up.

01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:50.790
There, there, won't be
long now.

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:02.950
<i>Jennifer!</i>

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:10.230
Jennifer!

01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:14.430
<i>- Who is it?
- Jennifer!</i>

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:16.950
It's that nosy bitch Joan.

01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:19.950
I'll take care of her.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:24.510
I wouldn't want you to violate
your delicate sensibilities.

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:31.230
<i>Jennifer!</i>

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:51.430
Jennifer?

01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:59.110
Jennifer!

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:35.910
Jennifer?

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:46.950
<i>Oh my God!</i>

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:55.950
Jennifer.

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:01.310
Look out behind you!
Joan!

01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:24.030
Look, I'm not gonna
give you crap.

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:27.710
Nobody is perfect, Tiff.

01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:31.350
I've got a few
skeletons in the closet myself.

01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:40.190
See? Come on, Tiff?

01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:42.870
How long did it take
to build Rome anyway?

01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:46.030
Tiff?

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:51.590
Glen?

01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:54.270
Guess again, daddy.

01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:58.790
- Glenda?
- That's my name.

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:03.030
- Don't you ever hear?
- Oh shit!

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:09.750
- What did I miss?
- Nothing much.

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:12.190
I just fired Joan.

01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:19.190
Looks like you win after
all, Tiff.

01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:22.870
- Congratulations.
- You both win.

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:28.070
I'm a real lady killer,
if you catch my drift.

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:31.590
I'm a boned bonus baby.

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:37.470
Jesus Christ Chucky,
what did you do to him?

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:41.350
What did I do? At least I spent
time with the kid.

01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:45.190
Glen, wake up!

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:49.150
Stop it, mommy.
You'll wrinkle my dress.

01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:52.950
How do you like it?
I made it myself.

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:55.830
Like mother, like daughter,
right?

01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:01.510
Like mother, like daughter.
Like mother, like daughter.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:05.510
Wake up! Right now!

01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:17.750
Mom? Dad?

01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:33.310
What am I?

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:46.110
Push, Mrs. Tilly.
Push!

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:48.910
I'm pushing,
you little star fucker!

01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:54.470
Pay no attention to little
Mrs. Potty Mouth. She's hormone.

01:05:58.710 --> 01:06:01.830
Oh my God! It's coming!

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:04.150
I can see it's little head.

01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.430
What is it? What is it?

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:19.030
- It's a boy.
- A boy.

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:20.710
Thank God.

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:22.750
Give me my baby.

01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:42.910
Chucky, we're not done
here yet.

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:45.510
- What?
- Jennifer isn't done.

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:47.990
We've got another one here.

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:50.750
Push, Jennifer. Push!

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:53.430
Push! Push it out!

01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:58.590
What's this one?

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:03.830
It's a girl.

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:18.510
Chucky, it's time.

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:25.990
- Give me the power, I beg of you.
- Hold it!

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:28.510
Hold it. Chucky.
First he has to choose.

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:30.990
I beg your pardon?

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:33.550
Sorry, she has to choose.

01:07:34.310 --> 01:07:35.990
We don't have time for this shit.
- Wait Chucky!

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:41.470
We have a son and a daughter.
Glen and Glenda.

01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:45.230
Don't you get it?
Maybe they don't have to choose.

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:51.910
- Help!
- Hurry Chucky, do the chant!

01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:54.550
- Somebody help!
- Chucky, do it now!

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:57.430
- Help! Help us!
- We won't get another chance.

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.750
What are you waiting for,
Chucky?

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:09.190
- Help!
- Do it! Do it!

01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:12.350
Everybody shut up!

01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:15.430
I've had it! That's it!

01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:18.630
There's a limit
to how much I can take.

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:20.630
What are you talking about?

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:23.830
Look around you, Tiff.
This is nuts!

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:27.510
And I have a very high
tolerance for nuts.

01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:29.630
If this is what it takes
to be human...

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:33.550
then I'd rather take my chances as
a supernaturally possessed doll...

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:35.470
it's less complicated.

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:38.990
- You can't be serious.
- As a heart attack.

01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:42.990
Think about it. What's so great
about being human anyway?

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:48.029
You get sick, you get old,
you can't get it up anymore.

01:08:48.109 --> 01:08:49.990
I'm not looking forward
to that.

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:54.590
Honey, I wanna be
Jennifer Tilly.

01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:57.470
I wanna be a star.

01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:59.950
And I don't wanna be
your chauffer.

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:03.189
As a doll, I'm fucking infamous!

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:07.109
I'm one of the most notorious
slashers in history.

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:08.950
And I don't wanna give that up!

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.310
I'm Chucky,
the Killer Doll!

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:14.029
And I dig it!

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:21.630
I have everything I want.
A beautiful wife.

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:26.229
A multi-talented kid.

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:29.109
This is who I am, Tiff.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.149
This is me!

01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:35.830
Chucky, I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about...

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:38.790
I don't know who the fuck
you are anymore.

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:41.870
But it's not enough for me.

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:43.950
I want more.

01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:46.590
What are you saying?

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:48.590
It's over.

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:51.750
We've gotta get out of here,
Sweet Face.

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.910
I'm leaving you, Chucky,
and I'm taking the kid.

01:09:56.950 --> 01:10:01.230
Nobody leaves me!
Nobody!

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:06.350
No! No!

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:14.190
Jennifer, I love...

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:19.710
Stan tell me, tell me...

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:42.870
Jesus!

01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:52.430
- Oh my God!
- My babies!

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.550
I just wanna know
where they are.

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:08.070
They're fine, Jennifer.
They're in the maternity ward.

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:10.390
- Alright...
- The important thing for you...

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:13.750
to think about now is getting well
so you can get on with your career.

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:16.430
I don't care about my career,
I want my babies.

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:18.990
I'm working on it Jennifer,
but you're not making it easy.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:21.590
I already talked to the cops,
they cleared me.

01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:23.110
They know that you're
not a killer...

01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:25.390
they didn't say you were
mentally competent.

01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:27.790
What do you expect
after the story you told?

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:29.710
It's true.

01:11:30.710 --> 01:11:33.630
I suggest from now on you
keep that to yourself.

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:38.350
We'll talk later.

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.230
Try to get some sleep.

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:57.030
Wish me luck, Sweet Face.
Mommy is gonna be a star.

01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:17.390
I can't think of a thing to say.
Fuck it!

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:24.550
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:38.310
Switch! Switch! Switch!
Switch!

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:46.990
Nobody leaves me! Nobody!

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:09.750
What can I say?

01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:14.470
Honey...

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:17.230
be a good girl...

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:21.270
or boy, whatever.

01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:26.910
Don't make the same mistakes
your mom and dad made.

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.910
Specially your dad.

01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:20.990
Let's go.

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:38.710
- Glenda?
- No, dad.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.390
It's me, your boy.

01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:43.990
Your chipper-filled block.

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:50.310
Are you proud of me now, daddy?
Are you?

01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:06.630
Oughta boy, kid!
Oughta boy!

01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:31.390
Glen, there, there.

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:36.670
It's alright. It's alright.

01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:39.670
You're gonna be alright.

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.350
There, there.

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:49.470
Honey, it's alright.

01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:16.030
Yesterday, she gave him a bloody
nose and took pictures for showing.

01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:21.110
And I'm pretty sure she's been
taking money from my purse.

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:22.830
That's ridiculous.

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:26.670
Glen is an angel, an absolute
dream. But Glenda...

01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:31.390
she's a bad girl, Mrs. Tilly.
A very bad girl.

01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:33.590
I'm not listening to this.

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:39.230
- I hate that thing.
- Some of the kids wanna see her.

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:40.750
- Mrs. Tilly...
- What?

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:42.430
I'm afraid of her.

01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:45.390
Fulvia, it's only a doll.

01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:49.950
I was talking about Glenda.

01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:56.350
Fulvia, just exactly are you
trying to say?

01:17:57.630 --> 01:17:59.390
I can't work here anymore.

01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:01.870
- What?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:06.590
If you only saw the way she
looks at me with such... hate.

01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:13.110
Alright Fulvia,
if that's what you want.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:17.350
- We'll miss you.
- Thank you, Mrs. Tilly.

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:20.190
God bless.

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:59.230
<i>Mom got her wish.
She's a bright shining star.</i>

01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:02.190
<i>Now we're the perfect family.</i>

01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:05.030
<i>I've learned a lot about myself.</i>

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:09.030
<i>I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not a freak.</i>

01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:11.630
<i>And even though we had
our differences...</i>

01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:14.710
<i>I know my dad really
loved me.</i>

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:19.110
Glen sweetheart,
come over here.

01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:24.070
Sweetheart look,
here's another one.

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:27.630
- Who is it from, mommy?
- I don't know.

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:29.710
Let's see.

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:34.710
It doesn't say. Strange.
Doesn't say who it is.

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:37.390
Sweetheart don't run so fast,
you can trip.

01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:38.670
So anyway...

01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:59.990
<i>he was on a movie,
he was gonna go after...</i>

01:23:00.305 --> 01:23:06.547
