00:13.610 --> 00:17.171
[alarm blaring]

00:21.620 --> 00:22.940
[gasps]

00:22.950 --> 00:25.647
[cell phone rings]

00:25.650 --> 00:26.640
Hello?

00:26.660 --> 00:28.059
Woman: This is brighton
home security.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.619
Mrs. Wade, what is
your emergency?

00:29.630 --> 00:31.120
Oh, my god. I think
somebody's in my house.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.689
All right, ma'am.
A security team

00:32.700 --> 00:35.453
Has been dispatched, and
police have been notified.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.451
Can you safely
exit the house?

00:37.470 --> 00:41.236
I don't know.
I'm in my bedroom.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.640
[creak, thumping]

00:51.650 --> 00:53.709
Somebody's downstairs.
I can't get out.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.246
Return to your bedroom
and lock the door.

00:56.250 --> 00:59.743
Stay calm.
Help is on the way.

01:14.340 --> 01:17.162
Ohh. Aah! Aah!

01:17.170 --> 01:19.502
Aah!

01:27.680 --> 01:30.069
Aah! Ohh!

01:47.370 --> 01:49.998
Ethan: Morning, wesley.

01:53.710 --> 01:55.303
Ethan.

01:55.310 --> 01:56.573
What are you
doing here?

01:56.580 --> 01:58.799
I'm heading to school
just around the corner.

01:58.810 --> 02:00.471
Does your mom know
where you are?

02:00.480 --> 02:02.539
I've seen you run here
a few times.

02:02.550 --> 02:04.484
Do you live close by?

02:04.490 --> 02:06.049
It's a couple
of blocks over.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.380
So we're neighbors.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.484
Not exactly
neighbors.

02:09.490 --> 02:11.879
How did you get here?
Where's your mom?

02:11.890 --> 02:14.052
How long have you
lived here?

02:14.060 --> 02:15.221
Not long.

02:15.230 --> 02:18.393
You know, I think it's
time we get you to school.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.097
Your mom wouldn't want
you talking to strangers.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.740
You're not a stranger.

02:25.010 --> 02:27.877
Just the same, um...

02:28.910 --> 02:30.002
Let's get you
to school.

02:30.010 --> 02:33.310
I know where it is.
I'm good.

02:36.350 --> 02:37.511
Beth: Any questions?

02:37.520 --> 02:40.649
No. It's everything
that you told me

02:40.660 --> 02:43.152
Except for
your real name--

02:43.160 --> 02:46.084
Michelle webber.

02:46.100 --> 02:50.958
Yeah. Michelle.

02:50.970 --> 02:54.759
I'm sorry
about your family.

02:54.770 --> 02:57.796
Thank you.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.700
And ray is still
incarcerated?

03:00.710 --> 03:04.135
His family has money,
so they negotiated

03:04.150 --> 03:06.801
His sentence down
to a mandatory program

03:06.820 --> 03:09.118
At the seattle pacific
psychiatric hospital,

03:09.120 --> 03:11.817
And he's been there
ever since the fire.

03:11.820 --> 03:13.709
So perry used
your friend tracy

03:13.720 --> 03:15.210
To gain access
to your home.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.157
And to gain enough information
to find out my real identity.

03:19.160 --> 03:23.154
Janice, my records have been
sealed since I was 18 years old.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.525
This kid...

03:25.530 --> 03:26.725
He's so smart.

03:26.740 --> 03:27.662
And psychotic.

03:27.670 --> 03:31.038
And he comes from money
just like ray,

03:31.040 --> 03:32.735
So we can't arrest him
unless we have

03:32.740 --> 03:36.699
Real proof that he's
been stalking me.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.844
This is on his wall?

03:41.850 --> 03:44.820
If we could confiscate
these drawings legally,

03:44.820 --> 03:48.017
We'd have a real threat,
and we could arrest him.

03:48.020 --> 03:48.851
Won't stick.

03:48.860 --> 03:50.510
No, but once he's
arrested,

03:50.530 --> 03:51.929
A judge will grant
a full search warrant.

03:51.930 --> 03:54.991
We could get his phone gps
records, his internet searches.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.399
We could build a case.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.495
It's a jack.
There's a new--new case.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.730
Janice...

04:01.740 --> 04:06.610
Discretion is
very important to me.

04:06.610 --> 04:08.601
You can trust me, beth.

04:08.610 --> 04:11.170
Mrs. Wade: It was
my ex-husband tom.

04:11.180 --> 04:12.409
Tom wade
the hockey player?

04:12.410 --> 04:14.879
Yeah. Don't be impressed.
He's not impressive.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.075
How do you know
it was him?

04:16.089 --> 04:19.286
He knows the alarm code.
He still has keys.

04:19.290 --> 04:21.678
He knows to use
the back stairs.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.749
Stella, he's your
ex-husband.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.228
Why didn't you change
the locks

04:25.230 --> 04:26.129
And the security code?

04:26.130 --> 04:29.020
My assistant quit,
and I've been so busy.

04:29.030 --> 04:30.429
The details
escaped me.

04:30.430 --> 04:32.125
How long you been
you divorced?

04:32.130 --> 04:34.019
Officially
since last month.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.530
We've been separated
for the past year.

04:35.540 --> 04:42.276
Look. Tom's been a creeper
forever. Here's weird that way.

04:42.280 --> 04:46.399
I don't know.
Since we've been divorced,

04:46.420 --> 04:47.706
<i>He's just been
a nuisance--</i>

04:47.720 --> 04:51.145
Drunken phone calls,
harassing me in public,

04:51.150 --> 04:52.379
That kind of thing.

04:52.390 --> 04:53.619
Why did you
get divorced?

04:53.620 --> 04:55.611
It's not a secret
we had a rocky marriage.

04:55.620 --> 04:58.385
It was all over tmz.
You can read about it online.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.154
Would you mind
telling us?

05:00.160 --> 05:01.457
Tom's a sports star.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.451
With that comes
the lifestyle.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.461
Some are better at
handling it than others.

05:05.470 --> 05:09.065
He'd have a bad game,
he'd drink, he'd get angry.

05:09.070 --> 05:10.469
Did he hurt you?

05:10.470 --> 05:12.268
He could be rough,
yeah.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.739
One night after
some pretty heavy drinking,

05:14.740 --> 05:19.280
He picked a fight like he
always did after a bad game.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.272
The night ended
with a fractured cheekbone.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.580
I called the police.
I filed a police report.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.080
That was
the last straw.

05:27.090 --> 05:29.286
I wanted a divorce,

05:29.290 --> 05:30.780
And he didn't
want that,

05:30.790 --> 05:33.760
And that's
why he's stalking me.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.353
Tom: I got an alibi
for last night.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.998
We're aware of that.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.320
What else is
there to know?

05:38.330 --> 05:40.128
My client
clearly was not

05:40.140 --> 05:41.665
At his ex-wife's
home.

05:41.670 --> 05:44.162
Did you fracture your
wife's cheekbone, tom?

05:44.170 --> 05:45.001
Excuse me?

05:45.010 --> 05:46.102
Don't answer
that, tom.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.259
Those charges
were dismissed.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.600
During the divorce
settlement.

05:48.610 --> 05:50.374
Look. I've never laid
a finger on my wife,

05:50.380 --> 05:51.450
Not the story
she tells.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.770
Well, I'm sure
it's not.

05:52.780 --> 05:54.714
We also have the transcripts
here of her 911 call.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.940
They don't exactly paint
you in @ sympathetic light.

05:57.950 --> 05:59.440
How did she fracture
her face?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.780
I'm not allowing
these questions.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.781
My client is here
on his own accord.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.155
Look. It's ok.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.230
I don't mind
talking.

06:05.230 --> 06:08.860
I have an alibi,
I'm here, T'll talk.

06:08.860 --> 06:11.227
Stella's
a pathological liar.

06:11.230 --> 06:13.062
Yes, we were
fighting, ok,

06:13.070 --> 06:14.959
But I didn't
hurt her.

06:14.970 --> 06:17.894
Look. She got drunk,
fell on her face,

06:17.910 --> 06:19.309
Fractured
her cheekbone.

06:19.310 --> 06:22.837
I'm not saying
we never fought, ok?

06:22.850 --> 06:24.238
We partied a lot
when were married

06:24.250 --> 06:26.969
With booze and late
nights, a lot of them, ok?

06:26.980 --> 06:30.041
We'd fight and make
up, fight, make up.

06:30.050 --> 06:31.313
It was
our thing, ok,

06:31.320 --> 06:34.312
But she's lying
about me hitting her.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.880
We all know you
could have hired someone

06:36.890 --> 06:37.982
To terrify
your wife, tom.

06:37.990 --> 06:40.254
It'd be as easy as
convincing your teammates

06:40.260 --> 06:41.227
To cover for you.

06:41.230 --> 06:42.254
If you pursue
that avenue,

06:42.260 --> 06:44.194
We will sue you for
false incrimination.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.998
You have
his alibi.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.320
Let's go, tom.
Hold on, hold on.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.492
Look. I'm not
a bad guy.

06:50.510 --> 06:51.864
I mean, I know
how I look.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.269
How do you look?
The cliche--

06:53.280 --> 06:55.578
Pro player,
party boy, you know,

06:55.580 --> 06:58.277
Textbook egomaniac
prone to fits

06:58.280 --> 06:59.839
Of narcissistic
rage.

06:59.850 --> 07:01.579
I'm not. I got two
college degrees,

07:01.580 --> 07:03.947
I got a sports camp that
I work at on my free time.

07:03.950 --> 07:06.510
I'm no longer
involved in stella's life.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.352
Stella's a woman with a
lot of friends and enemies.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.352
I don't know why you're
wasting your time with me.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.919
I moved on.

07:12.930 --> 07:15.149
Hope that helps.

07:16.430 --> 07:18.569
Ben: Ok. Thanks.

07:18.570 --> 07:20.026
Tom wade's alibi
checks out.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.190
No fingerprints
at the scene to connect him.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.704
He was convincing,
maybe too convincing?

07:25.710 --> 07:27.530
He clearly resents
his wife, bruised ego,

07:27.540 --> 07:29.531
But it doesn't fit with
sitting in her closet,

07:29.550 --> 07:31.871
Well, stella is
a beverly hills socialite,

07:31.880 --> 07:34.372
So he may be right about
her having some enemies.

07:34.380 --> 07:36.348
Let's find them.

07:38.550 --> 07:43.010
[music playing,
indistinct chatter]

07:44.890 --> 07:47.052
Man: What's this
a benefit for again?

07:47.060 --> 07:49.825
Children.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.468
I'm getting looks.

07:51.470 --> 07:52.824
Does everyone know?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.069
Of course they do.

07:54.070 --> 07:55.731
It was online
immediately.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.538
[sighs]

07:59.440 --> 08:00.930
Here's your
champagne.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.908
Thank you.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.913
Hello, stella.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.445
Surprised to see you.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.315
I was invited.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.085
Of course,
but with your break-in.

08:15.090 --> 08:17.013
Do they know
who it was?

08:17.030 --> 08:18.179
They suspect.

08:18.190 --> 08:20.284
It's good to see
you cynthia.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.859
Hello, ryan.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.089
It's richard.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.864
You've met him
twice already.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.326
Oh, that's right.
I'm so sorry.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.594
No, you're not.
That was deliberate.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.430
Seriously, cynthia?

08:31.440 --> 08:32.929
Ugh. I'm not
in the mood.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.931
Oh. God forbid
I make you mad.

08:34.940 --> 08:36.874
We know what happens
when you get mad.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.769
What do you want
from me, cynthia?

08:38.780 --> 08:40.179
We have been
through this.

08:40.179 --> 08:42.274
You slept
with my husband.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.645
Are you aware of
that, ryan, richard?

08:43.650 --> 08:45.288
That happened
after you left him.

08:45.290 --> 08:46.610
That doesn't
make it ok.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.611
Friends don't sleep with each
other's husbands--exes or not.

08:48.620 --> 08:51.351
Well, then it's a good thing
you're not a friend anymore.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.350
You took care of that.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.454
Richard: Uh, ladies, uh,
keep your voices down.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.827
Or what? Somebody
might hear the truth,

08:56.830 --> 08:58.821
It might hurt your
precious reputation?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.389
Well, you know what?
It's too bad.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.164
It's time the truth
comes out.

09:02.170 --> 09:06.710
Deal with it, live
with it. I have.

09:19.890 --> 09:21.881
[sighs]

09:21.890 --> 09:23.619
[squeak]

09:25.830 --> 09:27.753
Hello?

09:27.760 --> 09:30.092
Who's in there?

09:36.700 --> 09:37.770
[gasps]

09:37.770 --> 09:39.033
Oh, excuse me.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.439
It's the champagne,
dear.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.772
It runs right
through me.

09:52.750 --> 09:57.358
Hello?
Someone's in here.

10:06.730 --> 10:07.697
Hey.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.294
No, no!
Get off me!

10:10.310 --> 10:12.199
Ugh!

10:21.050 --> 10:24.475
Jack: Your friend
is in holding.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.242
Con you confirm his
alibi two nights ago?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.457
Yes. He was with me.
Why?

10:28.460 --> 10:29.985
Someone broke into
stella's house.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.789
It wasn't richard. He was
with me two nights ago.

10:32.790 --> 10:33.951
We had dinner, then sex.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.099
Then we watched tv
and had more sex.

10:36.100 --> 10:36.999
Next question.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.593
How long have you
been dating richard?

10:38.600 --> 10:39.897
For exactly one month.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.129
When will he be
released?

10:41.140 --> 10:42.289
That's not
our department.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.734
He accosted
your friend stella.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.230
But he didn't
hurt her.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.935
He was defending
my honor,

10:46.940 --> 10:49.307
And friend is
a stretch.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.334
Why don't you
like her?

10:50.350 --> 10:51.806
Look. I haven't
done anything.

10:51.810 --> 10:54.450
I didn't tell richard to follow
her into the ladies room.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.576
That was
his dumb idea.

10:55.580 --> 10:56.672
Just answer
the question.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.909
Why don't you
like stella?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.240
That damn book.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.580
What book?

11:01.590 --> 11:03.410
Her memoir.

11:05.660 --> 11:07.355
It's not out yet.
Next month.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.828
I got a copy
of the galleys.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.753
Someone shoved it
in my mailbox.

11:10.770 --> 11:14.627
Total surprise-- she says
some horrible things about me.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.940
She claims I slept
with her ex-husband tom.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.169
Did you?
No.

11:19.170 --> 11:20.638
Lying or making
false statements

11:20.640 --> 11:23.678
Is an obstruction
of justice.

11:24.110 --> 11:26.772
I never slept with him
while they were together.

11:26.780 --> 11:27.679
She had left him.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.114
And she wrote about
it in this book?

11:29.120 --> 11:31.270
It's a tell-all.
She trashes everyone in it.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.110
She made me out
to be a slut.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.281
If you believe her,
I've slept

11:34.290 --> 11:35.883
With every married man
in beverly hills.

11:35.890 --> 11:37.984
Well, why would
she say that?

11:37.990 --> 11:39.355
Do I need a lawyer?

11:39.360 --> 11:40.623
Would you like
a lawyer?

11:40.630 --> 11:43.292
No. I'd like to leave.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.268
I've done
nothing wrong.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.632
Beth: How could you
not tell us about the book?

11:50.640 --> 11:52.506
You didn't think it was
important to our investigation?

11:52.510 --> 11:55.377
No, I didn't. My ex-husband
doesn't even know about it.

11:55.380 --> 11:59.146
Cynthia does. Someone
sent her a copy.

11:59.150 --> 12:00.140
It wasn't me.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.573
It's a tell-all. It's
important the who's who

12:02.580 --> 12:04.378
Remains a secret
until its release.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.983
I read some of your
book. You said some

12:05.990 --> 12:07.719
Pretty harsh things
about people close to you.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.814
People have always
looked down on me,

12:09.830 --> 12:11.821
Called me
stupid, dumb,

12:11.830 --> 12:13.355
And then
when I divorced tom,

12:13.360 --> 12:15.419
Everyone made me out
to be a gold digger.

12:15.430 --> 12:18.229
Well, I'm not dumb,
and I'm not a gold digger.

12:18.230 --> 12:19.925
I wanted to set
the record straight,

12:19.940 --> 12:21.169
So I wrote a book,

12:21.170 --> 12:23.935
And no matter what
cynthia or anyone else says,

12:23.940 --> 12:26.659
My book is the truth,

12:26.680 --> 12:27.761
Every word of it.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.407
Well, you're gonna have
to get us a list of names

12:29.410 --> 12:30.775
Of all the people
you trashed in it

12:30.780 --> 12:33.602
Because they're
now suspects.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.172
Man: So what's
this about?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.386
Is whitley in trouble
or something?

12:39.390 --> 12:40.687
It's nothing really.

12:40.690 --> 12:43.216
Just following up
on a complaint.

12:43.230 --> 12:47.724
Figures. Perry
is a weird dude.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.528
[knocks on door]

12:49.530 --> 12:51.191
Guess nobody's home.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.693
Let's peek,
confirm that.

13:50.460 --> 13:53.623
Excuse me.
What's going on?

13:53.630 --> 13:55.359
Mr. Whitley, I'm
with the lapd--

13:55.360 --> 13:57.624
I don't care.
You can't just

13:57.630 --> 13:59.769
Come into my room
like this.

13:59.770 --> 14:00.692
Well, actually, I can.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.362
This being
a private university,

14:03.370 --> 14:05.134
Bylaw mandates
they can cooperate

14:05.140 --> 14:07.268
With any police investigation
with due cause.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.329
And what due cause
do you have?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.205
I don't see
anything.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.269
Do you?

14:16.120 --> 14:17.918
No.

14:18.820 --> 14:22.279
But being a detective
and all...

14:23.460 --> 14:26.521
I'm pretty good
at looking.

14:34.670 --> 14:35.740
Jack: She has
a lot of enemies.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.300
She's candid, calls it
like she sees it.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.630
If it's the truth.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.529
It's a good read.

14:41.540 --> 14:42.632
It's compelling.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.904
I'm getting the sense she
really loved her husband.

14:44.910 --> 14:47.902
Until she didn't.
He cheated on her.

14:47.920 --> 14:48.842
I knew that was coming.

14:48.850 --> 14:50.841
I'm still
on her eating disorder.

14:50.850 --> 14:52.488
She licks it.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.811
Have you gotten to
the plastic surgeon yet?

14:54.820 --> 14:56.811
Dr. Roger chase,
yeah.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.218
I just found out
dr. Chase filed a lawsuit

14:58.230 --> 15:00.028
Against the book,
naming the publisher,

15:00.030 --> 15:01.520
The editor,
and stella.

15:01.530 --> 15:02.998
She blasts him
in her book.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.092
He should be angry.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.364
Check him out.
Take ben.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.589
There's a confidentiality
agreement

15:08.600 --> 15:10.329
Between doctors
and patients,

15:10.340 --> 15:11.830
So there's very little
I can tell you.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.103
So what can you
tell us?

15:13.110 --> 15:14.566
Yes, I treated her.
For what?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.379
A maxillofacial procedure
to rebuild her cheek.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.769
Ben: Did she mention
how she crushed her cheek?

15:19.780 --> 15:20.747
I won't answer that.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.115
Was it consistent
with an injury

15:22.120 --> 15:23.679
Obtained during a
domestic abuse incident.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.613
It certainly
could have been, yes,

15:25.620 --> 15:26.849
But look. I didn't ask.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.680
I was trying to
help stella.

15:28.690 --> 15:31.455
Stella and I are friends,
or we were.

15:31.460 --> 15:32.859
What happened?
Her book happened.

15:32.860 --> 15:35.352
I worked on her,
gave her the family discount

15:35.360 --> 15:37.055
And my discretion,

15:37.070 --> 15:41.724
And she tells the world I'm
downing oxycodone by the bottleful.

15:41.740 --> 15:42.536
Is it the truth?

15:42.540 --> 15:44.190
She might be trying
to sell books,

15:44.210 --> 15:45.700
But I could lose
my license.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.064
I'm sorry. Is it
true or not?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.138
You didn't answer.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.302
I was never
on oxycodone.

15:50.310 --> 15:52.745
Where'd you get your
copy of the book, doctor?

15:52.750 --> 15:55.947
I don't know.
It showed up one day

15:55.950 --> 15:57.873
By courier anonymously.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.619
No note?

16:00.420 --> 16:03.310
So you read the book
and you called your lawyer?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.628
Exactly right.
You see, gentlemen,

16:05.630 --> 16:07.928
I'm a respected
member

16:07.930 --> 16:10.729
Of a highly
litigious community.

16:10.730 --> 16:13.062
I don't need
to stalk anyone.

16:13.070 --> 16:14.890
I sue them.

16:20.070 --> 16:22.801
[doorbell rings]

16:24.780 --> 16:26.270
If you came
for another fight, I--

16:26.280 --> 16:28.942
I came to apologize.

16:28.950 --> 16:29.917
And who's this?

16:29.920 --> 16:31.945
Security. I'm still
having issues.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.281
You've got
a lot of issues.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.849
Please, cynthia.
I didn't realize

16:34.860 --> 16:36.419
The book would
leak so quickly.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.616
I wanted to talk to
you before you read it.

16:38.630 --> 16:40.257
Richard is still
in jail.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.455
The won't arraign him
until tomorrow.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.851
I know. I'm sorry
about that.

16:44.870 --> 16:45.996
Can I come in?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.025
He can stay
out here.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.998
I just want a chance
to explain.

16:52.370 --> 16:54.668
[sighs]

16:56.640 --> 16:59.280
Thank you.
I'll be 5 minutes.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.100
Yes, ma'am.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.875
Stella: I know the book
was hurtful.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.175
You revealed
too much.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.839
You made me out
to be some whore

17:06.859 --> 17:09.613
Sleeping with every
married man in town.

17:09.619 --> 17:10.951
When this book
comes out,

17:10.960 --> 17:12.883
I'm gonna be
a pariah.

17:12.890 --> 17:14.618
You hurt me, cynthia.

17:14.630 --> 17:17.190
You slept
with my husband.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.497
I mean, separated
or not,

17:18.500 --> 17:20.992
You don't do that
to a friend.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.128
I just wanted to
get back at you.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.368
I'm sorry.

17:25.369 --> 17:27.702
It's a little late
for apologies.

17:27.710 --> 17:30.133
Maybe in time,
you will understand

17:30.150 --> 17:34.747
Why I needed
to tell the truth.

17:34.750 --> 17:38.471
I really am sorry,
cynthia.

17:42.090 --> 17:45.583
Ok. Good night.

18:10.450 --> 18:12.509
[clatter]

18:20.960 --> 18:24.521
[screaming]

18:27.400 --> 18:29.596
[whimpering]

18:37.640 --> 18:39.540
Cynthia has been
abducted.

18:39.550 --> 18:42.042
We have video footage of her
attacker, but we can't I.D. Him.

18:42.050 --> 18:43.245
He carried her
from the house

18:43.250 --> 18:44.911
To the rear of the
property to a side street,

18:44.920 --> 18:46.740
Where we believe
he had a car waiting.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.888
So she's
still alive?

18:47.890 --> 18:50.609
We're not certain,
but we think so.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.779
He took her
for a reason.

18:51.790 --> 18:53.224
Would you happen
to know that reason?

18:53.230 --> 18:56.552
Security footage puts you
there moments before the attack.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.221
I went to apologize,

18:58.230 --> 19:00.927
To try and fix
things between us.

19:00.940 --> 19:05.559
And now it's escalated to the people
in your life, the people in your book.

19:05.570 --> 19:06.969
I need to know why.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.802
I've told you
everything I know.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.818
Amanda, I need to
talk to you.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.242
About?

19:18.250 --> 19:18.944
Ethan.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.281
Please don't
do this here.

19:20.290 --> 19:21.815
I don't want to.
I wasn't even going to,

19:21.820 --> 19:24.118
But I saw ethan yesterday. What?

19:24.130 --> 19:26.485
I was jogging,
and he found me somehow.

19:26.490 --> 19:28.083
What do you mean he
found you somehow?

19:28.100 --> 19:29.352
I didn't initiate
contact,

19:29.360 --> 19:30.657
I didn't tell him
a thing,

19:30.670 --> 19:32.968
But he asked me a lot
of questions.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.267
He acted strangely.

19:34.270 --> 19:39.162
I got the feeling that he might
know more about me than you think.

19:39.170 --> 19:41.832
That's not possible.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.176
Oh, no.

19:46.180 --> 19:47.773
What?
I had a conversation

19:47.780 --> 19:48.941
With trent
the other night,

19:48.950 --> 19:50.111
And I told him
about you.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.679
Ethan must have
been listening.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.113
I thought that
he was asleep.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.212
Oh, my god.

19:55.220 --> 19:57.860
I'm sorry, amanda, but
maybe this is a good thing.

19:57.860 --> 19:58.952
Jack, don't do that.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.519
Just tell me what
you want me to do,

20:00.530 --> 20:02.692
And I'll do it.

20:06.870 --> 20:08.827
Janice: Everything
was gone.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.138
He was smart, got
rid of the evidence.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.699
He's smart,
but he's scared.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.462
Taking that down's
a defensive move.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.005
And a hasty move.

20:16.010 --> 20:17.136
He took
the sketches down,

20:17.150 --> 20:18.299
But they move
too much to him.

20:18.310 --> 20:19.800
He wouldn't
get rid of them.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.039
Yeah. There are copies
somewhere

20:21.050 --> 20:22.074
On his cell phone,
computer,

20:22.080 --> 20:24.310
But we don't have
enough for a warrant.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.140
I'm on it.

20:26.150 --> 20:28.744
Janice.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.388
Thank you.

20:31.390 --> 20:33.779
Happy to help.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.697
I tracked down the
courier who delivered

20:36.700 --> 20:37.895
Stella's tell-all
to dr. Chase.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.164
It originated
from her book editor

20:40.170 --> 20:41.319
Oliver grazinger.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.762
Why am I
not surprised?

20:42.770 --> 20:44.499
Jack, voice-over:
You want to explain?

20:44.510 --> 20:45.932
I sent
the manuscript out.

20:45.940 --> 20:46.930
To dr. Chase
and cynthia.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.499
It's a book
in the 21st century.

20:48.510 --> 20:49.830
It has to be
an event.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.932
So you deliberately
caused drama.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.100
I just wanted to get people
talking about the book.

20:53.110 --> 20:55.101
That leads to blogs
and gossip sites.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.940
Social media
creates buzz,

20:56.950 --> 20:58.270
Gets everyone's
attention.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.689
'We have
a missing woman,

20:59.690 --> 21:01.340
Who may be dead.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.852
It's publishing.
You can't put that on me.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.921
People leak this stuff
all the time.

21:06.930 --> 21:11.049
Who else did you send
advanced copies to?

21:11.070 --> 21:12.959
I want every name.

21:12.970 --> 21:15.268
Jack, voice-over: This is
every person grazinger sent

21:15.270 --> 21:18.763
I've got more. There have
been other abductions.

21:18.770 --> 21:19.805
3 days ago,
an acting coach

21:19.810 --> 21:22.302
Who told stella to
consider veterinary school

21:22.310 --> 21:23.209
Went missing.

21:23.210 --> 21:24.905
He's in the book,
chapter 3.

21:24.910 --> 21:27.777
Day before that, a boyfriend
she had before here marriage,

21:27.780 --> 21:28.747
A guy who broke
her heart,

21:28.750 --> 21:30.639
He was grabbed from
his home in silverlake.

21:30.650 --> 21:33.312
Hasn't been since.
He's chapter two.

21:33.320 --> 21:36.051
And no one's connected the
disappearances before now.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.085
They weren't related
before now.

21:38.090 --> 21:39.285
We had the profile wrong.

21:39.290 --> 21:41.725
These abductions are not
about resentment Or revenge.

21:41.730 --> 21:43.550
Someone goes
and snatches what,

21:43.560 --> 21:45.221
Perceived enemies
of stella?

21:45.230 --> 21:46.925
The act itself
is delusional.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.261
It's eager to please.

21:48.270 --> 21:49.590
That would be
a love obsession.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.399
So if our stalker is using
stella's tell-all as his hit list,

21:52.410 --> 21:54.265
Then who's
the next target?

21:54.280 --> 21:55.509
Going in order
of the book,

21:55.510 --> 21:57.501
She wrote about the
boyfriend who broke her heart,

21:57.510 --> 21:59.171
Next comes her acting coach,

21:59.180 --> 22:00.443
Then her beverly hills
friends,

22:00.450 --> 22:01.747
Most notably
cynthia wheeler.

22:01.750 --> 22:04.913
The next chapter talks all
about her marriage to tom wade.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.342
So the next target
is tom wade.

22:06.350 --> 22:09.251
Get a unit out.
We need to find him now.

22:44.690 --> 22:46.328
[clatter]

22:46.330 --> 22:49.129
Hillary, is that you?

22:58.370 --> 22:59.963
Unh! Ohh!

22:59.970 --> 23:03.076
[grunting]

23:11.220 --> 23:13.882
Unis went
by tom wade's house.

23:13.890 --> 23:15.984
He's training. They say
he's been at the gym all day.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.253
I was just on
with chase's office.

23:17.260 --> 23:19.183
He went missing
after a routine rhinoplasty

23:19.190 --> 23:20.328
Less than an hour ago.

23:20.330 --> 23:21.559
Any signs
of a struggle?

23:21.560 --> 23:23.654
Nurse found a bottle of
pills all over the washroom.

23:23.660 --> 23:24.491
No dr. Chase.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.820
So he was taken
like the others.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.229
Which means the stalker
broke his pattern.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.265
He went after chase
instead of tom.

23:29.270 --> 23:32.501
Or--wait a second.
I remember something.

23:32.510 --> 23:35.434
This is stella's. original
manuscript that she gave to beth.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.671
It's the one that she submitted
to her editor grazinger.

23:38.680 --> 23:42.002
This is the galley grazinger
sent out to drum up publicity.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.419
What's the difference?

23:43.420 --> 23:46.515
In stella's manuscript,
the chapter on chase

23:46.520 --> 23:47.840
Comes before the chapter
on top.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.682
So the stalker's going in the
order of the original manuscript.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.010
And according
to her editor,

23:52.030 --> 23:55.022
Only he and stella had
access to her first draft.

23:55.030 --> 23:57.453
I'll tell beth.
Nicely done.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.699
You look surprised.

23:58.700 --> 23:59.565
Just impressed.

23:59.570 --> 24:00.924
Beth: Stella, besides
your editor,

24:00.940 --> 24:03.466
Who else has a copy of
the original manuscript?

24:03.470 --> 24:04.767
No one.

24:04.770 --> 24:06.260
You sure about that?

24:06.270 --> 24:09.205
And just to confirm, you
wrote the book yourself,

24:09.210 --> 24:10.132
No ghostwriter.

24:10.140 --> 24:11.574
Yes. I already
told you that.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.878
In the book,
you wrote that

24:13.880 --> 24:16.110
When you first moved
to |.A. You lived

24:16.120 --> 24:17.815
A peripatetic existence.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.072
That's right.

24:19.090 --> 24:22.879
That's such an uncommon
word--peripatetic.

24:22.890 --> 24:24.085
What does it mean?

24:24.090 --> 24:26.286
Are you asking me
for the definition?

24:26.290 --> 24:28.429
You used it 3 times
in the book.

24:28.430 --> 24:31.229
You also said that
you were sanguine

24:31.230 --> 24:33.221
About your prospects.

24:33.230 --> 24:36.461
Do you know what
sanguine means?

24:36.470 --> 24:37.392
Ok. This is ridiculous.

24:37.410 --> 24:39.731
We can bring in
a linguistics expert

24:39.740 --> 24:41.333
If you need some help,

24:41.340 --> 24:43.980
Or you can just
tell us the truth.

24:43.980 --> 24:47.439
You didn't write
this book, did you?

24:47.450 --> 24:50.977
Fine. All right.
I hired a ghostwriter.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.186
Even though you said
you didn't.

24:53.190 --> 24:54.589
His name is
cameron robbins.

24:54.590 --> 24:56.251
I met him
at a party.

24:56.260 --> 24:57.489
He said he needed
the work,

24:57.490 --> 25:01.028
He had a good resume,
so I paid him to help me out.

25:01.030 --> 25:02.589
And did you
and this ghostwriter

25:02.600 --> 25:03.590
Get romantic?

25:03.600 --> 25:05.159
We spent a lot
of time together,

25:05.170 --> 25:07.264
Going through
old photo albums,

25:07.270 --> 25:08.829
E-mails, letters.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.196
We got close, but it
was never serious.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.109
It was all business.

25:13.110 --> 25:14.430
What about after the
book was finished?

25:14.440 --> 25:16.704
I paid him, and we
went our separate ways.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.439
And you never told anyone
about the ghostwriter,

25:18.450 --> 25:20.043
Not even
your editor?

25:20.050 --> 25:23.111
No, especially
not my editor.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.987
Everybody in this town
has always judged me.

25:25.990 --> 25:29.449
They look at me like I'm some
dumb hockey player's wife,

25:29.460 --> 25:33.624
So I wanted them
to see me differently.

25:33.630 --> 25:35.382
Cameron helped me.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.893
I may not have written
every word in that book,

25:38.900 --> 25:41.369
But everything in it
is the truth.

25:41.370 --> 25:45.159
Did cameron ever express
strong feelings for you.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.399
We never talked
about love,

25:46.410 --> 25:48.162
If that's
what you mean,

25:48.180 --> 25:51.673
But sure, I got
the sense he cared.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.307
And you rejected him?

25:53.310 --> 25:56.575
Which is exactly what
would make him stalk you.

25:56.580 --> 25:58.309
Cameron?
He's a sweet soul.

25:58.320 --> 26:02.314
Stalking is how he would
maintain a connection to you.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.583
Lashing out at your
enemies could be a way

26:03.590 --> 26:05.354
Of protecting you,
showing his love.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.055
Where can we find
him, stella?

26:07.060 --> 26:11.224
He lives in some
old building in hollywood.

26:14.730 --> 26:16.835
[knock on door]

26:16.840 --> 26:19.332
Los angeles police!

26:27.850 --> 26:29.614
Hello?

26:33.590 --> 26:37.185
Los angeles police.
Anyone home?

26:40.960 --> 26:42.257
[knocks on door]

26:42.260 --> 26:44.422
Los angeles police.

26:55.810 --> 26:58.871
Nobody's home.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.076
Check out
the computer.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.639
That's stella
when she was younger.

27:02.650 --> 27:04.709
I recognize her
from her book.

27:04.720 --> 27:10.056
Lots of photos,
keepsakes.

27:10.060 --> 27:11.812
His way of staying
close to her.

27:11.830 --> 27:15.152
Looks like he's been recording
his sessions with stella.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.389
You ready
to get started?

27:16.400 --> 27:17.720
Taking notes
for the book.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.721
She's not even aware
she's being recorded.

27:19.730 --> 27:21.164
So after tom and I
were first married,

27:21.170 --> 27:24.094
I mean, it was great,
honeymoon kind of love,

27:24.110 --> 27:26.238
Lots of gifts,
no complaints,

27:26.240 --> 27:28.163
But I kind of got
the feeling that he used

27:28.180 --> 27:30.433
The gifts to make up
for other things.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.271
What things?

27:31.280 --> 27:32.770
Drinking,
coming home late,

27:32.780 --> 27:33.850
Saying mean things.

27:33.850 --> 27:36.820
I mean, that's when
the fighting started.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.242
Wait.

27:38.250 --> 27:39.911
He recorded something
two days ago

27:39.920 --> 27:42.855
Because it just
timed out.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.749
Look at me!
I paid you cash!

27:44.760 --> 27:45.659
Ben: Who's this?

27:45.660 --> 27:47.321
You feed me the book
as you write.

27:47.330 --> 27:48.354
I can't deal
with it.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.124
I never should have
given you those pages.

27:50.130 --> 27:53.464
I know that voice.

27:53.470 --> 27:56.599
She's never gonna be
with you, you understand?

27:56.600 --> 27:58.090
She--she doesn't--
she hates you.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.362
Not according
to the book, ok?

27:59.370 --> 28:00.440
I read it.
She loves me.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.135
Did love you.
Past tense. Did.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.608
Just--just take
your money, ok?

28:03.610 --> 28:06.250
I'm calling stella,
and I--

28:22.630 --> 28:26.396
Tom wade's been lying
to us the whole time.

28:27.630 --> 28:30.531
Cameron robbins is dead.

28:33.870 --> 28:36.407
I'll lock it.

28:44.820 --> 28:47.209

28:48.490 --> 28:51.710
Is everything ok?

28:51.730 --> 28:55.155
[muffled groans]

29:06.570 --> 29:09.267
Oh, my god.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.739
What--what's going on?

29:15.180 --> 29:17.171
Hey, baby.

29:17.180 --> 29:20.184
I--tom.

29:20.190 --> 29:22.716
What is all this?

29:22.720 --> 29:23.858
This?

29:23.860 --> 29:26.886
This is all
for you.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.654
No.

29:38.300 --> 29:39.290
That was jack.

29:39.310 --> 29:41.130
They just found
the ghostwriter's body.

29:41.140 --> 29:42.369
He's been dead
for two days.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.132
Murdered.
It's all on tape.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.402
Apparently, tom wade
hired the writer

29:45.410 --> 29:46.946
To slip him chapters
of stella's manuscript.

29:46.950 --> 29:49.373
The writer recorded the whole
thing as an insurance policy.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.417
He ended up recording
his own murder.

29:51.420 --> 29:53.309
Tom killed him
in a rage.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.140
So right profile,
wrong suspect.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.787
Tom wanted stella back.

29:56.790 --> 30:00.385
He sees cameron coming
and going from stella's house.

30:00.390 --> 30:01.585
He recruits cameron
for his cause,

30:01.600 --> 30:04.126
Cameron wants to
come clean, he kills him.

30:04.130 --> 30:06.963
But why kidnap
stella's enemies?

30:06.970 --> 30:08.324
He's had
a psychotic break.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.399
He's--he's hurting
the people who hurt stella.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.561
He's showing her
his love.

30:11.570 --> 30:12.901
I'll put out a bolo
on tom wade.

30:12.910 --> 30:15.265
All right. We got to get
to stella before he does.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.430
Tom: Your book really,
really opened my eyes.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.772
It helped me see
from your point of view

30:19.780 --> 30:21.009
I was not a good husband!

30:21.020 --> 30:23.773
See, I didn't-- I didn't
focus on your needs.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.420
It's all in the past. It's ok.

30:26.420 --> 30:28.411
No, it's not ok, ok?

30:28.420 --> 30:32.118
You know what? I'm gonna
prove to you right now...

30:32.130 --> 30:33.086
No.

30:33.090 --> 30:34.125
How much I care.

30:34.130 --> 30:35.757
Apologize to my wife.

30:35.760 --> 30:39.151
Apologize to my wife!
No, tom, don't!

30:39.170 --> 30:41.764
No. It's ok. She doesn't
need to apologize.

30:41.770 --> 30:43.932
I know you love me, ok?

30:43.940 --> 30:45.533
Let me--let me do it.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.599
What?
Let me...Do it.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.169
No. I can do it.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.773
I want to do it.

30:50.780 --> 30:51.702
Give me the gun.

30:51.710 --> 30:53.348
She's made
my life hell.

30:53.350 --> 30:55.705
I want to--
I want to do it.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.212
Please give me the
gun. Give me the gun.

30:58.220 --> 31:01.645
You sure? Yeah. I want to do it.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.458
I want the gun.

31:03.460 --> 31:06.452
Are you sure?
Yeah.

31:06.460 --> 31:07.882
Please give me
the gun.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.288
I can do it.

Ok.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.959

I'm sorry.

upstairs. He's crazy.

for backup.

32:40.990 --> 32:43.789
Are you in here?

32:43.790 --> 32:45.986
Yeah. I'm here.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.583
Stella, are you ok?

32:47.590 --> 32:48.887
Yeah.
Where is he?

32:48.900 --> 32:50.789
I don't know. I hid.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.894
He's somewhere
in the house.

32:52.900 --> 32:54.265
Follow me.
Ok.

32:54.270 --> 32:56.022
Ok.

33:04.310 --> 33:06.745
All right. Go.
Ok.

33:11.020 --> 33:12.818
Unh!

33:13.690 --> 33:16.079
Agh!

33:16.090 --> 33:17.854
Agh!

33:56.130 --> 33:58.792
Hiya, perry.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.290
I'm on my way
to the library.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.029
That's none of my
business. I'm sure daddy

34:02.040 --> 34:03.292
Will be happy
to hear it.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.564
You know, beth tried this
with me in parking lot once, too.

34:05.570 --> 34:08.301
Gonna smack me around
like she did?

34:08.310 --> 34:09.368
I just want to talk.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.304
I know you were digging
around into beth's past.

34:12.310 --> 34:15.405
I did some digging
of my own.

34:15.420 --> 34:18.344
Your mother was
really beautiful.

34:18.350 --> 34:19.545
You have her eyes.

34:19.550 --> 34:22.679
Of course, you don't
remember what she looked like.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.248
You were only 4
when she died.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.478
Is that something you
learned in psych 101,

34:26.489 --> 34:30.154
Trying to crack a suspect
by talking about his mother?

34:30.159 --> 34:32.549
Go ahead.
It doesn't affect me.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.219
It already has
affected you.

34:34.230 --> 34:36.995
It's why you become fixated
on people you old in esteem

34:37.000 --> 34:40.504
Like your old roommate eric
and now beth.

34:40.510 --> 34:44.435
You're looking to
replace your dead mother.

34:44.449 --> 34:49.377
Did you know the police suspected
your father in the shooting?

34:49.380 --> 34:50.916
Yeah. I have a cop friend
in santa barbara.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.842
That's where you
grew up, right?

34:52.850 --> 34:55.387
Seems your family
is very popular,

34:55.389 --> 34:58.018
Even with the scandal,

34:58.030 --> 34:59.953
Your mom
sleeping around,

34:59.960 --> 35:02.281
Having affairs
one after another,

35:02.300 --> 35:06.624
One of which was a
colleague of your father's.

35:06.630 --> 35:07.859
You're making
this up.

35:07.870 --> 35:09.964
Look it up yourself.
Do some research.

35:09.970 --> 35:11.631
You're good at that.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.438
It's not gonna work,
detective.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.862
Really?

35:14.880 --> 35:18.032
Because it looks
like you're angry.

35:18.050 --> 35:19.040
I'm not angry.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.269
It's ok to be
angry, perry,

35:21.280 --> 35:25.877
Because you're just a little
boy with mommy issues.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.916
The coroner declared
a shooting a suicide.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.285
Your mother
killed herself,

35:30.290 --> 35:33.055
And it screwed you up.
Shut up.

35:33.060 --> 35:34.880
You're screwed up now, and
you were screwed up back then.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.460
That's probably why she blew
her head off in the first place.

35:37.460 --> 35:38.950
She knew you had
mental disabilities,

35:38.970 --> 35:40.620
And she didn't
want to deal with you.

35:40.630 --> 35:43.998
Don't be angry, perry.
She was sick just like you.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.638
Mental illness
is hereditary.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.666
Unh! Err!

35:48.680 --> 35:49.932
[siren]

35:49.940 --> 35:51.078
[tires squeal]

35:51.080 --> 35:53.174
Get your hands
off her!

35:53.180 --> 35:55.342
Come here!

35:55.350 --> 35:57.648
[perry grunting]

35:57.650 --> 35:59.277
Het your hands
behind your back.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.782
Give me your hands!

36:01.790 --> 36:04.259
Perry whitley,
you're under arrest

36:04.260 --> 36:06.479
For assaulting
a police officer.

36:06.490 --> 36:09.653
Come on. Let's go.

36:09.660 --> 36:13.198
You made a huge mistake.
You have no idea!

36:13.200 --> 36:14.964
Hey. Come on, buddy.

36:14.970 --> 36:17.860
[music playing]

36:27.180 --> 36:29.342
[doorbell rings]

36:32.950 --> 36:35.920
You sure this is
what you want?

36:57.540 --> 36:59.372
Is it ok?

37:09.060 --> 37:10.812
Hey, ethan.

37:10.820 --> 37:12.811
Hey.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.651
Ahem. I was just
gonna warm up some food.

37:15.660 --> 37:18.357
You hungry, jack?

37:18.370 --> 37:20.168
Yeah.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.168
What you playing?

37:29.180 --> 37:31.239
I just got
a new game.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.400
It's pretty cool.

37:38.180 --> 37:42.287
You want to be
player two?

37:42.290 --> 37:45.009
Yeah, sure.

37:47.930 --> 37:50.558
When you first start,
"a" makes you go fast...

37:50.560 --> 37:52.221
Thank you.

37:52.230 --> 37:55.120
And "b" makes you stop,

37:55.140 --> 37:57.529
And "a" and "b" together
is special

37:57.540 --> 37:59.690
Because you shoot out.

38:03.810 --> 38:06.529
You gonna be mad
if I beat you?

38:06.550 --> 38:08.541
No.
Ok.

38:08.550 --> 38:10.439
But you won't.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.588
Oh, yeah.
You are fast.

38:14.590 --> 38:16.445
Take pretty long
to beat.

38:16.460 --> 38:19.953
[music continues]

38:29.400 --> 38:30.799
Wow. You're good.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.963
Thanks.

38:33.970 --> 38:36.405
Have you tried it
before? You're really good

38:36.410 --> 38:40.745
No. It's my--
my first time.
