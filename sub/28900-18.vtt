19:57.360 --> 19:59.900
Always check your
bylaws, people.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.240
That's something a real student
council president would do.

20:04.910 --> 20:05.990
Why don't we hear
from the accused?

20:06.660 --> 20:08.910
Booker, we're all aware
of your infraction.

20:08.910 --> 20:10.160
What do you have to
say in your defense?

20:10.790 --> 20:12.540
(sigh) Coach.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.170
I have
never vaped.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.840
‐And that's the truth.
‐And I can testify to that
as a character witness.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.840
My brother makes
good choices.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.220

I got this, thank you.

20:28.140 --> 20:29.850
Okay, before,

20:29.850 --> 20:32.890
I used to think vaping
could only poison your body.

20:34.270 --> 20:36.690
But now, I realized...

20:37.570 --> 20:39.020
that it can also
poison friendships.

20:41.030 --> 20:42.030
I saw you with the vape.

20:42.530 --> 20:45.070
That's because he took
it away from William.

20:45.070 --> 20:46.490
That's a lie!

20:46.490 --> 20:48.160

‐Quiet!

20:48.160 --> 20:49.580
Now, why should I believe you?

20:49.580 --> 20:51.700
Before, you told me it was
Booker's. Now, it's William's.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.670
He's probably got one
in his pockets now.

20:55.330 --> 20:57.170

I happen to need a pen!

21:11.810 --> 21:12.810

Oh, wait, this might actually
not be a pen after all.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.820
No, it's not.
This is a vape.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.480
(murmuring)

21:21.980 --> 21:24.110
Now, you kids need to know how
dangerous these things are.

21:24.110 --> 21:26.360
They're addictive
and they have chemicals.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.950
Do you know there's
formaldehyde in them?

21:27.950 --> 21:31.160
That's the stuff they
keep the dead frogs in
in the science lab.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.460
Yeah, and vapes put
all that in your lungs.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.290
Just because I had
a vape in my pocket,

21:36.290 --> 21:38.000
doesn't mean that
Booker's not guilty.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.210
I saw him vape.

21:40.210 --> 21:41.710
No one's ever seen
me vape, have they?

21:43.260 --> 21:45.260
Oh! Wow.

21:46.090 --> 21:48.840
Well, I've seen enough.
Let's take a vote.

of lifting Booker's suspension,
