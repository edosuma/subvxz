00:01.302 --> 00:02.236
- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:04.072 --> 00:05.139
- This is so exciting.

00:05.173 --> 00:06.807
New Orleans it is.
- Bridesmaids...

00:06.840 --> 00:08.376
all: Hoo-ha-ha!

00:08.409 --> 00:10.444
- It's hard getting
on the same page as him.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.246
- When you say things,
and they hurt,

00:12.280 --> 00:16.250
or you text each other things,
that somewhere stays there.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.651
- Wow.
- I am so happy

00:17.685 --> 00:19.253
for you right now.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.089
- I'll start crying
if we all talk about this.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.156
- Okay, sorry.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.591
- It felt abrasive,
to just look at me be like,

00:23.624 --> 00:25.426
I don't give a f--- about you.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.329
- I don't know what to tell you.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.198
- Maybe if you'll just
get involved and go to

00:30.231 --> 00:32.600
the little church like I've been
trying to get you to, then--

00:32.633 --> 00:34.535
- I do, maybe I do need Jesus.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.637
God's sakes I need something.

00:36.670 --> 00:40.141
- It's my first
live performance tomorrow

00:40.174 --> 00:41.609
where I'm on the stage rapping.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.611
- This one's called "Get Loose."

00:48.682 --> 00:51.319
- Why do you have my clothes?

00:55.656 --> 00:58.859
- Go get a drink.
You're thirsty as f---.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.130
[Dena Deadly's

01:02.163 --> 01:05.666
- * You know
that it's our time *

01:05.699 --> 01:08.136
* These are the best days

01:08.169 --> 01:11.139
* Of our lives

01:11.172 --> 01:13.874
* Just raise
your glasses high *

01:13.907 --> 01:18.078
* This one's
for you tonight *

01:19.313 --> 01:20.881
- * La di da di da

01:20.914 --> 01:23.417
* That's just our style

01:23.451 --> 01:24.885
* Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo

01:24.918 --> 01:25.819
- Look at this.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.389
- I know, it's a healthy stack,
huh, man?

01:28.422 --> 01:31.592
Some don't have names, so...
- The anonymous responses.

01:31.625 --> 01:32.893
- It's going to be a surprise.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.128
- [laughs]

01:34.162 --> 01:38.432
Katie got these very beautiful,
very expensive invitations.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.135
They better not be
more than $5.00 apiece.

01:41.169 --> 01:44.205
- They're, like, $18.00 apiece.
- What?

01:44.238 --> 01:48.242
But she forgot to put a line
for people to put their names

01:48.276 --> 01:50.311
on the RSVPs,
so we don't really know

01:50.344 --> 01:51.745
who's coming to our wedding.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.914
Is that another anonymous?
- It is anonymous,

01:53.947 --> 01:56.317
except, rather than
checking "yes,"

01:56.350 --> 01:58.252
they drew a penis
where the "yes" goes.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.920
- That's gotta be Jax or Tom.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.655
Let me see.
I can tell by the penis.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.823
I'm not even kidding.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.593
Tom always has, like, pointy
balls, so I know it's his.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.362
Me, personally,
I like the really long shaft

02:08.396 --> 02:11.232
and the eeny-teeny little balls.
That's my signature.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.234
I think that's a Tom.
- Hello.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.369
- Hey, Doute.
- Hi.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.371
- Hi, Doute.
- Welcome to the party.

02:17.405 --> 02:20.241
- Tell me--Tell me some--
Dish me some dirty deets about--

02:20.274 --> 02:21.942
- Oh, the f--- is this.
- Tom gave me, like,

02:21.975 --> 02:24.378
an abbreviated version.
- Oh, I don't know.

02:24.412 --> 02:27.748
I mean, I went there to f---ing
eat popcorn and watch fireworks.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.287
That was my number one thing.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.789
- Scheana had texted me
last night, and Scheana got,

02:35.823 --> 02:37.791
like, mad at me because
I wasn't like,

02:37.825 --> 02:41.662
"Mm, tell me more."
I was kind of like, "But why?"

02:41.695 --> 02:43.664
- You have bigger fish to fry.
- I feel like

02:43.697 --> 02:45.699
I don't know, with, like, her
and Ariana being friends again

02:45.733 --> 02:47.668
and whatever that like
she's definitely

02:47.701 --> 02:50.438
been distancing herself.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.473
- You guys gotta hash that out
before we go to New Orleans,

02:52.506 --> 02:54.508
all right?
- Well, I also hope

02:54.542 --> 02:56.577
that Ariana can get her sh--
figured out too 'cause--

02:56.610 --> 02:57.645
- She will.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.979
She's gonna come with us--
- I don't know, like,

02:59.012 --> 03:00.080
you saw her...
- She's gonna come

03:00.113 --> 03:01.282
with the guys, yeah.
- At the paint and sip thing.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.584
- No, if someone can't come
and hang out with everyone--

03:03.617 --> 03:04.552
- She can.
- And get along with everyone...

03:04.585 --> 03:07.255
- She will.
- Then they don't need to come.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.223
Before we all
go on this

03:09.257 --> 03:10.991
bachelor/bachelorette
trip together,

03:11.024 --> 03:12.760
there are some people
in this wedding party

03:12.793 --> 03:15.596
that need to start
falling in line.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.298
First being Scheana,
and then,

03:17.331 --> 03:18.732
right underneath, Ariana.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.435
Stassi's feelings
mean more to me than Ariana's,

03:21.469 --> 03:24.672
so maybe she can find it
in her heart to apologize

03:24.705 --> 03:26.740
to Stassi for being a bitch.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.446
- * And I should've been
a movie star *

03:32.480 --> 03:35.816
* Toast of the west coast,
bronze skin, fast cars *

03:35.849 --> 03:39.420
* Loving you and needing you
and never ever leave me *

03:39.453 --> 03:41.389
- How's Tom?
He was, like, delirious.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.590
He's like,
"I'm doing a photo shoot,

03:42.623 --> 03:44.558
and I haven't modeled
in so many years."

03:44.592 --> 03:45.726
He's like, I forgot how--
what to do.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.660
Like, I just haven't eaten.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.696
- Don't feed the models.
- True statement.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.797
- That's the rule.

03:49.830 --> 03:53.634
For 30 years,
I've despised models,

03:53.667 --> 03:55.736
so it's kind of hard
to reconcile the fact

03:55.769 --> 03:58.339
that I'm now dating
a male model.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.840
- I got a photo shoot coming up.
- Yeah.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.743
- It looks like T-Sandy's
coming out of retirement.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.745
- He should be doing
his photo shoot

04:04.778 --> 04:07.681
pretty soon here.
- So last night, that was fun.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.482
- Oh, my God.
- Good times.

04:08.516 --> 04:11.685
- That was interesting.
- [laughs]

04:11.719 --> 04:12.720
- I was so angered last night.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.755
- Walk away.

04:14.788 --> 04:15.756
[shattering]

04:15.789 --> 04:17.257
Jax, no!

04:18.492 --> 04:21.762
- But the thing was nothing
went down until he started it.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.731
- That is not true!

04:23.764 --> 04:24.865
[door slams]

04:24.898 --> 04:27.901
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.771
- Hi.
- What's going on?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.640
- We're just talking
about DJ James.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.308
- Why are you talking about him?

04:34.342 --> 04:36.710
- James booked another job,
and he invited

04:36.744 --> 04:38.546
Tom and I to come.
- Well, that's a good thing.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.481
- Yeah, it's great,
but then a lot of other people

04:40.514 --> 04:44.885
came for maybe
not benevolent reasons.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.153
- Who went?
- This guy.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.656
- I was trying to give James...
- Find something better to do.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.391
- The benefit of the doubt
and listen to DJ James.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.459
- Oh, don't bullsh-- me.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.528
You wanted to wind him up.
- I love trance music.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.330
both: [laughing]
Trance.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.767
- I let James go so he could
go off and rebuild himself,

04:59.800 --> 05:02.736
and suddenly,
to have Jax and Scheana

05:02.770 --> 05:04.772
trailing him around town
looking for trouble

05:04.805 --> 05:06.840
is not what I had in mind.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.909
- Okay, how about, Jax,
we just admit

05:08.942 --> 05:10.811
we were wrong for going,
it was mean,

05:10.844 --> 05:12.746
we shouldn't have done it,
and we're sorry.

05:12.780 --> 05:13.914
- Of course
it's wrong and it's mean,

05:13.947 --> 05:16.484
but I'm gonna do it anyway.
I just--I don't like him.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.488
[upbeat music]

05:20.521 --> 05:21.755
*

05:21.789 --> 05:23.824
- This guy's
a really good photographer.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.826
- LA Models set this up.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.695
I gotta get
some good pictures,

05:27.728 --> 05:30.130
motivate them to, like, sign me.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.699
And then that way,
I can get my ass out there

05:31.732 --> 05:32.833
and start working.
- Dude, when's the last time

05:32.866 --> 05:34.835
you did a photo shoot?
- One like this for an agency?

05:34.868 --> 05:36.437
- Yeah.
- It's been a long time.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.571
I'm looking at
getting back into modeling,

05:37.605 --> 05:42.376
so I've been talking to
one of the top agencies in LA,

05:42.410 --> 05:43.911
and they're actually really
interested in signing me.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.714
But before that happens,
they just wanna make sure

05:46.747 --> 05:48.416
that I still have what it takes.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.517
- Wait, is this--

05:53.020 --> 05:55.789
- Whoa.
- Shh.

05:55.823 --> 05:56.990
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.091
- Hey.
- How's it going?

05:58.125 --> 05:59.860
Tom, nice to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you, Tom,

05:59.893 --> 06:01.595
Come in.

06:01.629 --> 06:04.432
You know, it's a bachelor pad,
so make yourself at home.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.666
- So I remember
being in college,

06:05.699 --> 06:08.001
sitting on my couch,
watching "Newlyweds,"

06:08.035 --> 06:11.739
watching Joe Simpson on TV,
and now Tom hits me up,

06:11.772 --> 06:12.740
and he's like,
"I'm going to shoot

06:12.773 --> 06:13.907
with Joe Simpson."

06:13.941 --> 06:15.809
Maybe, like,
Jessica will pop out.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.778
Did you have fun painting
the other night?

06:17.811 --> 06:19.413
- Yeah, yeah.
- You did?

06:19.447 --> 06:20.748
- It got awkward
towards the end.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.550
- Uh, I'll--I'll give you that.
- Icy cool.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.817
Katie was really
fired up too now

06:23.851 --> 06:25.853
'cause she gets defensive
over Stassi.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.120
She's like,
"If she's gonna act like that,

06:27.154 --> 06:29.590
"I don't want her coming to the
bachelor party or the wedding."

06:29.623 --> 06:31.625
- I'm like, "Dude, get
the f--- out of here, man."

06:31.659 --> 06:32.460
- She gets--

06:32.493 --> 06:34.862
- Ariana is not
a combative person.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.466
Stassi, Kristen, Katie,
all these people

06:38.499 --> 06:40.801
have proven to be
a combative person.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.636
- I have an opinion
about this,

06:42.670 --> 06:44.872
and I don't want
this to continue.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.807
This is not coming
to New Orleans with us.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.708
The boys are going to
be separating,

06:47.741 --> 06:49.510
the girls are going
to be separating,

06:49.543 --> 06:50.744
so if we all can't get along,
I don't know.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.913
- She will continue
to get along with everyone

06:52.946 --> 06:55.749
until they try and tell her
who she can and can't

06:55.783 --> 06:56.717
be friends with.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.686
- Listen, I'm Team Katie
for the next month,

06:58.719 --> 07:00.821
and hopefully
the rest of our lives,

07:00.854 --> 07:02.823
but for the next month,
unequivocally.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.558
- It'll be fine.
I'll talk to her.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.927
I'll tell her to be--maybe be
a little bit more polite.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.597
- Okay, cool.
- Anyways, dude.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.632
- You look shoot-ready.
- Yeah, let's do it.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.633
- Let's do it.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.968
*

07:15.002 --> 07:18.539
- All right, my man,
welcome to my art space.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.541
Okay, so with girls
we got boobs and we got

07:20.574 --> 07:21.809
all kinds of other stuff.

07:21.842 --> 07:25.813
With guys, we got
stomach in, d--- out.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.749
All right.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.750
- I won't look.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.818
- Do it.
Look at me, watch me.

07:30.851 --> 07:31.819
I want you to.
- No.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.053
- Tell me if you see something
cool or weird.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.254
- You're making it awkward.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.689
I gotta say,
as good as Tom looks,

07:35.723 --> 07:37.658
his hair's blowing
in almost slow motion.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.092
He's got these smoldering
bedroom eyes.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.829
Like, I don't envy him
right now, you know?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.864
I felt like I was always
better at just wearing

07:43.897 --> 07:47.568
a suit and doing,
like, jump poses.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.569
- Looks good.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.004
- That's hot, that's hot.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.806
Right here.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.909
- There are people that believe,
when you get your photo taken,

07:55.943 --> 07:59.012
that that photo is taking
a part of your soul.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.714
- Yeah, that's hot.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.850
Reach into the camera like
you're gonna catch the wind.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.784
That's hot.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.886
- But when I get
my photo taken,

08:05.919 --> 08:09.056
I feel like
it's giving my soul life.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.059
[camera shutter clicking]

08:12.092 --> 08:13.861
- I like it,
like where we're at.

08:13.894 --> 08:14.795
- Awesome, dude.
- Thank you, my man.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.963
- Thank you, dude.
I appreciate it, man.

08:15.996 --> 08:16.964
- You bet, thank you.

[upbeat music]

08:20.000 --> 08:20.968
*

08:21.001 --> 08:22.570
- You wanna sit outside?

08:22.603 --> 08:25.105
- Yeah.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.608
- You look so pretty.
- Thanks, baby,

08:27.641 --> 08:29.743
you look cute in that.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.583
- Can I get you started
on drinks right away?

08:35.616 --> 08:37.618
Do you guys need a few minutes?
- Uh, could we just get

08:37.651 --> 08:38.952
two ice waters
with lemon to start?

08:38.986 --> 08:40.320
- Of course.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.622
- I think I'm gonna need
a glass of Chardonnay

08:41.655 --> 08:43.591
after last night.
- Of course.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.326
- That f---ing psycho GG.
What did she say to you?

08:46.359 --> 08:49.129
- She was just talking about
how I'm an idiot

08:49.162 --> 08:52.065
for thinking that you
could be loyal to me

08:52.099 --> 08:57.871
and that I'm just dumb
for dating you, basically.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.647
- I'm just trying to understand,
like, how they even

09:06.680 --> 09:08.882
had the opportunity to, like,
take your clothes

09:08.916 --> 09:10.150
and take pictures
of you sleeping.

09:10.183 --> 09:13.020
- Babe, I was a--I was an idiot.
I mean, I honestly trusted them

09:13.053 --> 09:14.588
too much, you know?

09:14.622 --> 09:15.923
She could've just got
on the side of my bed

09:15.956 --> 09:17.891
and taken five of these
f---ing photos

09:17.925 --> 09:18.992
and just gotten out.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.929
*

09:21.962 --> 09:23.964
I mean, with the amount
of whiskey and old fashions

09:23.997 --> 09:26.667
that I was drinking,
I wasn't exactly coherent

09:26.700 --> 09:29.603
of everything that was happening
at my house.

09:29.637 --> 09:34.374
- You know, it's hard not to
have that little bit of doubt

09:34.407 --> 09:36.910
that, are you faithful to me?
- That I'm cheating on you?

09:36.944 --> 09:39.713
Yes, Raquel, yes,
I'm faithful to you.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.815
Honestly, if Raquel
was to leave me at this point,

09:41.849 --> 09:44.952
I mean, like, first my dad,
then Lisa and Sur,

09:44.985 --> 09:46.386
and then my girlfriend.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.889
It's like, I'm honestly
gonna be left with nothing

09:48.922 --> 09:50.624
by the end of the summer.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.761
- When I am in Sonoma,
like, I don't know if you're,

09:53.794 --> 09:59.933
like, able to stay loyal to me,
like, while I'm away.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.102
- I mean, I'm telling you
that I can be.

10:02.135 --> 10:06.039
- That doesn't really make me
feel very reassured.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.107
- You gotta trust me.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.876
That's all I can ask.

10:11.912 --> 10:12.680
- You guys keep giving up.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.546
- I still have...
- I know you do.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.048
- All the same feelings,
but I can't keep

10:19.386 --> 10:20.453
- * We are moving on
a million strong *

10:22.723 --> 10:26.827
* Do you feel it?
Do you feel the change in me? *

10:26.860 --> 10:31.031
* I'm moving on
[indistinct] *

10:31.064 --> 10:33.033
- Hello.
- Happy Sunday, thank you.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.201
- Hi, happy Sunday.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.103
- I kind of acted
like a d--- last week.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.370
Why don't I sit here
and tell your mother

10:37.404 --> 10:38.571
what I've done for you
since you've been here.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.074
Sitting on the couch for a year
while I take care of you.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.109
[door slams]

10:42.142 --> 10:44.745
Brittany's mom is kind of
asking a favor to me

10:44.778 --> 10:47.180
to attend church with Brittany,
and I feel like

10:47.214 --> 10:48.381
I kind of owe it to her.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.084
- We can sit right up here
in the front.

10:51.118 --> 10:54.154
- I changed a lot for Jax,
and him going to church

10:54.187 --> 10:56.289
is a small change
that he can make for me.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.059
You look very handsome.
- Flat screen TVs in church.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.195
Oh, okay, nice.
I--It's been a long time

11:02.229 --> 11:04.164
since I've been in a church.
I guess things have changed.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.867
I grew up going to church.
I was raised Catholic.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.436
I used to have to do plays
when I was younger.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.171
Christmas Eve, every year,
they always gave me

11:11.204 --> 11:13.306
the same part because
I'd never memorize my lines.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.275
What if I, like, love this
so much and I became,

11:15.308 --> 11:17.845
like, the director.
- That would be nice.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.814
- I only had to say,
"I bring you frankincense."

11:20.848 --> 11:22.015
What the hell is frankincense?

11:22.049 --> 11:25.185
- Each week, we celebrate
one of the underlying emotions,

11:25.218 --> 11:28.088
and this week,
we're celebrating anger.

11:28.121 --> 11:32.492
I don't know of no
more powerful or prophetic tool

11:32.525 --> 11:35.796
than for us to take
ownership and accountability

11:35.829 --> 11:39.800
for those times when we've
projected our anger at others.

11:39.833 --> 11:43.303
We have the power
to go the first step

11:43.336 --> 11:45.405
and say, "I screwed up."

11:45.438 --> 11:48.475
- How funny is it that
the message is about anger?

11:48.508 --> 11:51.178
I mean, this is
the perfect message for Jax.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.412
- But you know what?

11:52.445 --> 11:55.215
If your heart is truly open,
and you're willing to go there

11:55.248 --> 11:56.917
and build the bridge and say,
"You know what?

11:56.950 --> 11:59.953
"You matter so much to me,
I'm gonna say I'm sorry

11:59.987 --> 12:02.722
because you matter."

12:04.257 --> 12:07.494
- Ugh, no.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.930
- Take what you've found
and you've heard here

12:09.963 --> 12:11.464
out into that world.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.201
May God bless us
on this journey.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.237
[applause]

12:18.972 --> 12:21.174
- Thanks for coming with me.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.275
- You're very welcome.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.846
- You know, it does mean
a lot to me that you did this.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.948
- Hopefully, me going to church
is enough to get Brittany

12:27.981 --> 12:30.383
and her mom
back on Team Jax.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.219
Off my back
and back in that kitchen

12:32.252 --> 12:34.822
where she belongs, no,
just kidding, I'm kidding.

12:34.855 --> 12:35.956
- I mean--
- Can we chalk it off

12:35.989 --> 12:37.290
the list of things we did?
- Yeah, I--

12:37.324 --> 12:38.892
- Tell your mom we went?
- I'll tell mom we came.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.527
I'll tell her
it's different than back home,

12:40.560 --> 12:42.395
but it was still
a great experience.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.463
- Yeah, I mean,
everything in California

12:43.496 --> 12:44.932
is different from back home.
- Yeah, it was fun,

12:44.965 --> 12:46.867
and I'm glad we came, for sure.

12:48.035 --> 12:52.472
- * Ooh, ooh,
I'm coming home *

12:52.505 --> 12:55.442
* Coming home

12:55.475 --> 13:01.181
* Ohh, oh,
I'm coming home *

13:01.214 --> 13:03.550
- Chef Stassi's gonna make
everything better.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.885
- Seriously,
this is a good meal.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.019
I would like to have this meal.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.255
- I was really looking forward
to my surgery because

13:08.288 --> 13:11.391
I knew that you would have to,
like, really pull it out

13:11.424 --> 13:13.526
and take care of me.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.896
And I knew that you were gonna
have to come up with

13:15.929 --> 13:17.097
something to cook.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.999
- I came up to Lake Arrowhead
because my mom

13:19.032 --> 13:20.433
just had a hysterectomy.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.235
Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.537
- Two different types
of toast, and then

13:24.571 --> 13:26.006
a big scoop of cookie dough.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.007
[laughter]

13:27.040 --> 13:28.075
- Raw cookie dough?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.610
- One should never underestimate
the healing powers

13:30.643 --> 13:31.979
of raw cookie dough.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.213
[knocking]

13:33.246 --> 13:34.214
[barking]

13:34.247 --> 13:36.516
Oh, my God.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.551
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.987
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.455
- How are you?
- It's so nice of you to come.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.858
- I've gotten really close
to Dayna, Stassi's mom,

13:44.892 --> 13:46.493
and so, of course,
I want to be there for her,

13:46.526 --> 13:50.230
but I know Stassi is upset
about the breakup,

13:50.263 --> 13:53.466
and I want to be
a support system.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.603
Do you have advice for Stassi,
now that she's newly single?

13:56.636 --> 13:58.939
- She can--
I've already talked to her

13:58.972 --> 14:02.509
like ten billion times.
She should know by now.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.344
- This is the thing, Nikolai.
We've both fought for this

14:04.377 --> 14:06.379
for three years, and that's
a really long time to, like,

14:06.413 --> 14:07.948
be fighting for that.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.482
- Here's the biggie.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.053
You have your friends,
and Patrick is actually

14:13.086 --> 14:15.889
alone right now, okay?

14:15.923 --> 14:17.958
He has no one helping him.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.059
- Wait, what--
- I mean, I--

14:19.092 --> 14:20.961
I wanna talk to him.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.464
- Nikolai and Patrick
were very close.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.499
I introduce my little brother
to somebody,

14:26.533 --> 14:29.436
and then I just
took him from him,

14:29.469 --> 14:31.671
so I feel very guilty.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.106
It's a situation
that I can't--

14:33.140 --> 14:34.641
It's so hard
for me to articulate

14:34.674 --> 14:37.044
'cause I don't hate him.
- I know, I know you don't.

14:37.077 --> 14:37.911
- I still have
all the same feelings,

14:37.945 --> 14:39.980
but I can't keep
doing this to myself.

14:40.013 --> 14:43.516
I wanna be able to, like,
be in a steady situation,

14:43.550 --> 14:46.119
and he deserves to be
in a steady situation too.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.587
- You guys keep giving up.
- Nikolai, I know

14:47.620 --> 14:48.821
you love Patrick,
and I love that you do,

14:48.855 --> 14:52.525
but, like, I really do need
to be alone for a little while.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.094
I need to be alone.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.503
[melancholy music]

15:03.536 --> 15:04.671
*

15:04.704 --> 15:07.107
I need you to just,
like, be supportive

15:07.140 --> 15:09.977
'cause I feel like
I'm losing it.

15:10.010 --> 15:16.984
*

15:17.017 --> 15:19.019
[sobbing]

15:19.052 --> 15:24.591
- Life's tough, man,
especially in your 20s,

15:24.624 --> 15:26.359
but I love you.

15:26.393 --> 15:30.030
*

15:30.063 --> 15:33.033
[upbeat music]

15:33.066 --> 15:38.038
*

15:38.071 --> 15:41.674
- Hi, welcome.
How can I help you today?

15:41.708 --> 15:44.177
- I'm definitely gonna do
a London Fog.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.079
- Sure, and for you?
- Uh, I'll definitely do

15:46.113 --> 15:48.181
the London Fog as well, please.
- Sure, yes, okay.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.717
We'll bring that to you.
- Thanks.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.454
I'm not gonna lie and say
it's easy being a DJ around LA

15:54.487 --> 15:55.755
and being sober
at the same time,

15:55.788 --> 15:56.623
'cause it's not.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.525
I think this is gonna be
a really good

15:58.558 --> 16:02.462
new stage of my life,
a new road to walk down.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.732
What do you got going on
for the rest of the day?

16:05.765 --> 16:08.135
- Peter asked me to do
a small, little thing

16:08.168 --> 16:10.170
in the short that he's doing
that he wants to sell

16:10.203 --> 16:12.105
and get made
into a feature film,

16:12.139 --> 16:14.007
and it's kind of sci-fi
or whatever, and--

16:14.041 --> 16:14.874
- That's gotta be fun though.
Like, you're doing

16:14.907 --> 16:16.609
what you love, and...
- Yeah, yeah.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.046
I'm in LA for a reason, trying
to make a name for myself.

16:19.079 --> 16:22.182
Whether it's acting,
music, modeling,

16:22.215 --> 16:25.418
I gotta be hustling
at all times because, if not,

16:25.452 --> 16:26.786
I might as well be back
in St. Louis

16:26.819 --> 16:28.721
bartending at Ballpark Village.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.190
So you were pretty worked up
the other night,

16:30.223 --> 16:31.724
which, rightly so, man.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.627
- Honestly, I find it
flattering in another sense,

16:34.661 --> 16:36.496
that GG just wants
to f---ing make it so clear

16:36.529 --> 16:37.630
that I hooked up
with her before.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.734
I mean, f---ing hell,
I never even--I've never even

16:41.768 --> 16:43.002
like slightly hooked up with
the girl.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.105
- James, if you want me to be
completely honest with you...

16:45.138 --> 16:46.039
- Sure.
- It seems like

16:46.073 --> 16:48.041
it really did happen.
- I didn't do it.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.443
- And I'm not trying
to f---ing, like, grill you.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.678
I'm just trying
to help you out, man.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.046
- Well, that's what
you're doing right now.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.414
- Come on, dude.

16:54.447 --> 16:58.518
I wasn't there
to actually see penetration,

16:58.551 --> 17:01.588
but I don't feel like
I need to be.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.823
- It does almost, at this point,
sound easier to admit it,

17:03.856 --> 17:06.059
but I can't admit something
that didn't happen.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.097
- Schwartz told me
that Katie said something

17:10.130 --> 17:12.065
along the lines of,
"Well, if Ariana's gonna

17:12.099 --> 17:13.266
"act like that,
why would I have her come on

17:20.473 --> 17:21.441
- * I do this
with my eyes closed *

17:22.875 --> 17:23.643
- * Eyes closed

17:23.676 --> 17:24.877
- It's gonna be
Tom up right now?

17:24.911 --> 17:27.180
- Yeah, and we have his shots
in front of the green screen

17:27.214 --> 17:28.448
right now, yeah.
- Sounds good.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.317
Hey, hey!
- Hey, how's it going, guys?

17:30.350 --> 17:31.584
- What up, man?

17:31.618 --> 17:32.519
- Whoo!
- Man of the hour.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.621
I am producing
an eight minute short film

17:34.654 --> 17:36.323
called "The Riven."

17:36.356 --> 17:38.158
It's kind of like
"Star Wars" meets "Halo."

17:38.191 --> 17:39.326
It's gonna be amazing.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.527
It's gonna be eight--
eight minutes long

17:40.560 --> 17:43.163
so we can get a bigger budget
for a bigger feature film.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.165
That's what we're looking for
and looking to do.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.299
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man, it was a--

17:46.333 --> 17:47.500
- $100 million project.
- Yeah, man.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.502
- So I'm curious,
is this after, like,

17:49.536 --> 17:52.205
there was a battle or something?
- Yeah.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.107
- Basically,
my ship got attacked.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.475
- James' ship that got attacked.
You're actually going

17:55.508 --> 17:58.178
to rescue him right now,
and he finally was able

17:58.211 --> 17:59.579
to send a message to you,
and you're there to get him,

17:59.612 --> 18:01.281
and now you guys
are gonna embark--

18:01.314 --> 18:02.415
- Oh, 'cause I just got
his message.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.184
- Right.
- All right, so, dude, I mean,

18:04.217 --> 18:06.386
let's get you into the armor,
and, like, we'll give you

18:06.419 --> 18:08.188
last looks and we'll put you
in front of the green screen

18:08.221 --> 18:09.156
and ready to go, man.
- All right, cool.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.357
- Yeah, cool, awesome, man.
- Sounds good.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.459
- Let's do it.
- Hello.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.327
- Hey!

18:14.361 --> 18:16.329
- In the entertainment industry,
it's a really good thing

18:16.363 --> 18:18.431
to sort of be in
these smaller projects

18:18.465 --> 18:20.433
while people
are on their way up.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.236
- All right,
let's go for it, guys.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.673
- Roll one, scene 90, take one.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.242
- Commander, we received
your transmission.

18:29.276 --> 18:33.313
We've dispatched strike units
to your location.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.349
Glad to have--still with us.
Sh--.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.317
- Back to one, no worries, man.
- Okay, sorry.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.518
- Take two.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.154
- Commander, we've received
your tra--

18:41.188 --> 18:43.423
Ah, we've received
your trans--transmission.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.525
Commander, we received
your transmission.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.361
We've dispatched strike units
to your position.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.163
Strike pods.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.599
Dispatched strike pods
to your position.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.367
Glad to still have you with us.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.503
- Star Count, cancel that order
and ready me a ship.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.570
- Yes, Captain.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.439
- Uh, Tom.
- Yeah?

18:59.472 --> 19:00.773
- You keep on saying,
at the end, "Yes, Captain."

19:00.807 --> 19:02.775
Say, "Yes, Commander."
- Oh, sh--.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.411
Yes, Captain.
- Uh, "Yes, Commander."

19:04.444 --> 19:05.412
At the end.
- Ahh!

19:05.445 --> 19:06.479
- It's all good, man.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.248
- I should've had
stronger coffee.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.550
Commander, we received--
Commander, we received

19:10.583 --> 19:14.487
your transmission.
- You got this.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.190
- Commander, we received
your transmission.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.726
We've dispatched strike pods
to your position.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.394
Glad to still have you with us.

19:21.428 --> 19:22.629
- Dude, that one was great, man.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.531
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a wrap on Tom.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.399
- Yes, nice.
- That's a wrap, guys, whoo!

19:26.433 --> 19:27.367
[applause]

19:27.400 --> 19:30.403
- I mean, who knows?
Maybe Peter could become

19:30.437 --> 19:32.405
the next James Cameron,
and I could be in

19:32.439 --> 19:36.676
the next "Avatar."
Maybe.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.810
- It's cool out.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.380
- Photo shoot with Joe
the other day went really good.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.682
- I know, I wanna see
more of your pictures.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.517
- I was talking to Schwartz
while I was there.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.286
You know, him and Katie were
a little worried

19:46.319 --> 19:49.289
about the way things went
at the art night.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.823
- Okay, I mean I'll let--
- With you and Stassi.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.592
- I'll let them be worried,
but I don't think

19:52.625 --> 19:53.593
they have anything
to worry about.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.662
- Schwartz told me
that Katie said something

19:55.695 --> 19:57.464
along the lines of,
"Well, if Ariana's gonna

19:57.497 --> 19:58.731
"act like that,
why would I have her come on

19:58.765 --> 20:01.834
the bachelor party
or even the wedding?"

20:01.868 --> 20:04.804
- She's not gonna get an apology
from me because it will be fake.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.440
- If I were you though,
I would just try

20:07.474 --> 20:11.711
to not be so blunt.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.448
- I'm not--It's--
I'm not much of a sugarcoater.

20:16.483 --> 20:20.453
- * In California

20:20.487 --> 20:23.323
* Hey, hi, hello,
nice to meet ya *

20:23.356 --> 20:25.458
- * Meet ya, meet ya

20:25.492 --> 20:30.330
- * Hey, hi, hello,
in California *

20:30.363 --> 20:33.700
* Hey, hi, hello,
nice to meet you *

20:33.733 --> 20:36.403
- Hello.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.472
I'm a total sloth, but come in.
- Hey.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.308
- Girls are looking lovely.

20:41.341 --> 20:44.377
To what do I owe this visit?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.513
- Ooh, I'm glad you're home.
And to steal things.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.481
- Yes.
- What do you want?

20:48.515 --> 20:51.651
- Sangria, if you have it.
- Ahh,

20:51.684 --> 20:53.386
actually, I might have some.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.855
I might have some here.
- Listen, I'm hosting

20:55.888 --> 20:58.558
this thing tomorrow.
- What are you doing, exactly?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.460
Yeah, okay.
- Spa day.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.828
- Don't take it all.
- We'll just, like--

21:01.861 --> 21:03.630
- Just leave one bottle.
- 12 bottles, maybe?

21:03.663 --> 21:06.433
- Well, how many are you?
- Eight?

21:06.466 --> 21:07.567
- We have--God, we're eight.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.869
- So you'll only need
16 bottles then.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.371
- Well, yeah, with that crowd.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.873
- So tell me about
the party exactly.

21:13.906 --> 21:17.477
- Oh, it's just sort of
my bridal shower gift to Katie.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.779
- Pandora's a bit of a chip
off the old block.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.515
She absolutely
loves entertaining.

21:22.549 --> 21:25.718
I hope Stassi and Kristen don't
go over there and screw it up.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.388
Well, I hope it all
goes accordingly.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.889
- Why not, right?
I actually haven't

21:29.922 --> 21:31.624
thought about that.
Yes, I hope those two...

21:31.658 --> 21:33.393
- Oh, I've thought about it.
- Why?

21:33.426 --> 21:37.430
- Just Katie's attitude, man.
She's just been, like...

21:37.464 --> 21:38.531
- What do you mean?
Sit down.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.600
- A little erratic lately.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.102
I just feel like
she's been getting mad at me

21:43.135 --> 21:45.104
for every little thing.
- You have to give somebody

21:45.137 --> 21:46.806
a bit of the benefit of
the doubt when they're a bride.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.775
Their emotions run high.
- You know, you don't just get

21:48.808 --> 21:50.443
to be a raging bitch
all of the time.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.445
I feel like during
the summer of my wedding,

21:52.479 --> 21:54.681
I was a very calm bride.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.483
Kristen, stop, don't--
- You're my friend!

21:56.516 --> 21:58.651
- Don't start with me.
Seriously, Kristen, don't start.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.786
I'm getting married next week.
- She's getting--

21:59.819 --> 22:03.490
- No, no, no, no, no,
have her stop and start over.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.692
When I say ready, that means go.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.361
The power of everything
being all about Katie

22:08.395 --> 22:10.497
I think she's taking
a little to extreme

22:10.530 --> 22:12.732
because she just feels like
she can do whatever,

22:12.765 --> 22:15.502
say whatever, and have
absolutely no consequences.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.970
- She's gonna remember, like,
all these defining moments.

22:18.004 --> 22:18.938
- Mm-hmm.
- You know,

22:18.971 --> 22:21.608
her bachelorette party.
The wedding shower.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.444
The spa day.
And if there's a problem,

22:24.477 --> 22:25.678
you know,
at any of these events,

22:25.712 --> 22:26.846
and you're in the middle of it,
she's gonna

22:26.879 --> 22:28.047
hold you responsible.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.583
I'm surprised that Katie
is picking on Scheana

22:30.617 --> 22:33.420
because Scheana's been really
quite a good friend to Katie.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.955
It seems to me that whenever
Stassi's back in the mix,

22:35.988 --> 22:38.157
the whole balance changes,
and Scheana's

22:38.190 --> 22:39.125
gonna feel the brunt of it.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.993
Well, I know you'll
make everything lovely

22:41.027 --> 22:42.995
and give them lots of this.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.864
- Maybe not too much.
- Well, that doesn't sound like

22:44.897 --> 22:46.499
a good idea.
- Not too much of that.

22:48.468 --> 22:51.438
[upbeat music]

22:51.471 --> 22:58.478
*

23:01.781 --> 23:03.650
- Hey.
- Hey-o.

23:03.683 --> 23:06.486
- Hi.
- So did somebody order a groom?

23:06.519 --> 23:08.187
Yeah, right here.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.589
- Does anybody want
anything to drink?

23:09.622 --> 23:11.458
- Oh, yeah, I'll do
a Miller Lite.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.324
- I'll do a Coors Light.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.961
- I'm gonna do
vodka soda with lemons.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.529
- Do you guys wanna do
a round of shots?

23:16.563 --> 23:17.530
- Shots?
- Whoo!

23:17.564 --> 23:19.466
- What kind of shots?
- Jameson picklebacks.

23:19.499 --> 23:22.502
- Sure.
- So yeah, looks like...

23:22.535 --> 23:24.203
- New Orleans, baby.
- I know, New Orleans.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.538
- Nowleans.
- Good choice.

23:25.572 --> 23:26.773
- I think it's
a really good choice.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.476
- And we are going in full drag.
- We are going in full drag.

23:29.509 --> 23:30.376
- And we're not talking
lipstick and, like,

23:30.409 --> 23:32.612
a sideways wig, ha-ha.
We're talking, like,

23:32.645 --> 23:34.046
"Dude, I might wanna
f--- that guy later."

23:34.080 --> 23:37.049
[laughter]

23:37.083 --> 23:39.452
I always thought it'd be fun
to go full drag

23:39.486 --> 23:41.721
with Jax, Tom, and the guys
and just hit the streets

23:41.754 --> 23:43.956
and get utterly wasted
like we usually do,

23:43.990 --> 23:45.692
except, you know,
dressed as women.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.727
'Cause what guy hasn't
looked in the mirror

23:47.760 --> 23:49.061
and thought to himself,
"I wonder if I could

23:49.095 --> 23:50.863
be a hot chick."

23:50.897 --> 23:52.965
You've done it.
You've done it.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.034
- I think it's
the better we look,

23:55.067 --> 23:56.536
the better it's gonna be.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.504
- I'm down.
- Do you shave your armpits?

23:57.537 --> 23:58.671
- Yes.
- Okay, so you

23:58.705 --> 24:00.507
can go sleeveless.
- Yeah, I'm gonna wear--

24:00.540 --> 24:03.009
- Oh, my God, you could be
like a SuicideGirls style

24:03.042 --> 24:04.243
with the tags.
- Yeah.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.244
- Spaghetti straps--
- You're like

24:05.277 --> 24:06.646
the punk SuicideGirl.
- Yeah, I'm gonna be the

24:06.679 --> 24:08.915
Suicide punk Girl, like goth?

24:08.948 --> 24:14.687
I'm willing to dress
as a transvestite...yes?

24:14.721 --> 24:16.689
Transvestite,
I'm willing to dress

24:16.723 --> 24:18.257
as a transvestite
for one night because

24:18.290 --> 24:19.291
it's Tom's bachelor party.

24:19.325 --> 24:21.060
But I tell you what,
I'm not shaving my beard,

24:21.093 --> 24:22.795
so I'm gonna be one ugly woman.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.263
I'm gonna look up
SuicideGirls tonight,

24:24.296 --> 24:26.566
maybe take some notes,
hopefully my girlfriend

24:26.599 --> 24:27.600
doesn't see me doing this.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.502
Every time I do something
kind of remotely...

24:29.536 --> 24:31.270
- Oh, yeah.
- Homoerotic?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.171
- On the homo--homoerotic,
she just kind of, like,

24:32.204 --> 24:33.973
she looks at me like this,
she goes...

24:34.006 --> 24:36.042
- What do we do even remotely
in the homoerotic?

24:36.075 --> 24:38.611
- Jax--
- Ahh, says this guy.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.713
*

24:40.747 --> 24:42.915
- No, no, no, no.

24:42.949 --> 24:43.983
- It's candy.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.285
- Check.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.720
- Just like old times...
- Yeah.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.055
- Minus the penetration.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.657
- Okay, so next
order of business,

24:50.690 --> 24:53.092
we do have some unpleasant
things to address.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.193
- What?
- So ever since, like,

24:54.226 --> 24:58.097
the paint situation,
Stassi got, like, really upset,

24:58.130 --> 25:02.101
and I gotta say, I thought
you were a little harsh on her.

25:02.134 --> 25:05.004
Now it's, like, escalating,
and now the girls are thinking

25:05.037 --> 25:06.773
that you don't wanna be there
in the first place.

25:06.806 --> 25:09.909
- I am not going
to go up to Stassi

25:09.942 --> 25:11.744
and say that I owe you
an apology because

25:11.778 --> 25:14.614
I do not believe that I do,
but what I will do

25:14.647 --> 25:16.048
is come to an understanding
with her.

try to be cool as a--

25:18.184 --> 25:21.153
- By the end of tomorrow,
it'll be like me and Stassi,

25:21.187 --> 25:23.089
like, making out.
She's single now.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.091

f---ing awesome.

[cheering]

25:26.192 --> 25:30.029
- Hey, guys, guys,
to an awesome bachelor party.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.099
- To the hottest group of girls
I've ever seen.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.334
- And to not tucking our wieners
between our butt cheeks,

25:35.367 --> 25:37.970
unless, I will though,
I'll go there.

25:38.004 --> 25:42.108
- We're wondering if you had
any extra gowns or clothes.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.076
- Mrs. Jacqueline Taylor.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.959

knives and forks on the table?

25:59.992 --> 26:00.960
- Yeah.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.061
- Thank you.

26:02.094 --> 26:06.265
- * It's doing
funny things to me *

26:06.298 --> 26:08.968
- I was almost, like,
gonna do it just, you know,

26:09.001 --> 26:11.303
us four, but Katie said
she wanted everybody.

26:11.337 --> 26:14.006
- I was actually surprised
that you're letting them

26:14.040 --> 26:16.743
into your home.
- Eh, we'll see how they behave.

- Welcome.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.685
- Ooh, holy crap.

26:25.718 --> 26:29.656
This is incredible, oh, my God.
- Thank you.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.625
- Would you like some sangria?
- I would love some.

26:32.659 --> 26:33.926
- Vodka?
- So close.

26:33.960 --> 26:34.894
- This is so cute.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.395
- Wait until you see
the rest of the house.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.766

- Hi.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.167
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

26:41.200 --> 26:41.968
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

26:42.001 --> 26:45.171
- I like your hat.
- You look cute.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.639
- You wanna put
your stuff inside?

26:46.673 --> 26:48.140
- Oh, sure, yeah.
- I wanna see the house.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.677
- Me too.
- Yeah, come on in.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.145
- You have a piano.
- Yeah, this is the piano area.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.146
- So cool.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.114
- People have pianos?

26:55.147 --> 26:57.283
- This is so cool.
- Right?

26:57.316 --> 26:59.351
- That is awesome.
- Isn't it?

26:59.385 --> 27:01.721
- Are you f---ing kidding me?
Someone gets to live here?

27:01.754 --> 27:04.123
- This is the outdoors.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.158
- Do you wake up happy,
like, every day?

27:06.192 --> 27:07.226
- Pretty much, yeah.
- Yeah, I mean,

27:07.259 --> 27:08.227
how could you not?

27:08.260 --> 27:11.731
- Pandora's house is goals AF.

27:11.764 --> 27:15.067
It's immaculately decorated,
obviously.

27:15.101 --> 27:16.302
I can't wait to grow up.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.137
- And then the kitchen.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.706
- Oh, my gosh.
- Right?

27:19.739 --> 27:22.241
- This is my favorite room.
- This is the TV area.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.976
Okay, come on,
let's look quickly

27:24.010 --> 27:26.145
and then go have massages.
- All right.

27:26.178 --> 27:29.048
- This is the gym.
- Shut up.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.817
- This is our bedroom.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.018
- This is how
the other half lives.

27:32.051 --> 27:36.155
I'm just gonna gift my daughter
a house in Beverly Hills.

27:36.188 --> 27:40.026

- You guys, this is so amazing.

27:40.059 --> 27:43.095
- Happy 30th birthday.
Come and see it.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.697
- So it's so elegant.

27:44.731 --> 27:48.300
- I now know I chose
the wrong parents.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.370
- Um, let's go downstairs
because the massage people

27:51.403 --> 27:53.105
just got here.
You go first

27:53.139 --> 27:56.042
'cause it's your day.
Maybe with Brittany and Kristen?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.209
- Yeah.
- And then we have a lady

27:57.243 --> 27:59.145

to drop it off?

28:12.524 --> 28:16.362
Somebody will be down there
to sign for it.

How are you?
- Oh, Lordy...

28:23.435 --> 28:25.137
What are you so scruffy for?
- May I?

28:25.171 --> 28:26.105
- Well...
- I'm on my way to the gym.

28:26.138 --> 28:29.041
- Do I have a--Do you work out?
- Sometimes.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.410
Whoa, Jesus.
- Okay there?

28:31.443 --> 28:33.145
- Actually, a couple things
I need from you.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.213
- Yeah.
- First of all, I need

28:34.246 --> 28:36.115
to pick up some money from you.
- Oh, what, tips?

28:36.148 --> 28:37.416
- Yeah.
- Well, I could probably

28:37.449 --> 28:39.418
give you that
out of the loose change,

28:39.451 --> 28:42.154
the amount of tips you make.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.156
- Also, I have a question...
- Here, I'll sign that.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.892
- I'm wondering...
- Sign in there.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.195
- I'm wondering if, well,
okay, Tom's bachelor party's

28:49.228 --> 28:51.197
coming up, and we're gonna
have it in New Orleans.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.099
One of his ideas
that he wants to dress up.

28:53.132 --> 28:57.169
He wants the guys
to dress up in drag.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.537
New Orleans is kind of
that way...

28:58.570 --> 29:01.073
- Right.
- We're wondering if you had

29:01.107 --> 29:05.411
any extra...
If you had any...

29:05.444 --> 29:07.513
- Extra what?
- Old gowns, or clothes

29:07.546 --> 29:09.315
that we could borrow.

29:09.348 --> 29:12.418
I don't know
what kind of employee/boss

29:12.451 --> 29:14.153
relationship I have.
I can't believe

29:14.186 --> 29:16.122
I'm even doing this,
so this just goes to show

29:16.155 --> 29:17.189
what kind of a groomsman I am.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.458
- What do you want, exactly?
Like hats and things?

29:19.491 --> 29:21.193
- Yeah, like hats,
maybe you have some--

29:21.227 --> 29:23.129
do you have some
costume jewelry or something?

29:23.162 --> 29:25.164
- Do I look like I have
old costume jewelry?

29:25.197 --> 29:28.267
- I know, I know.
- Seriously, look at me.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.468
I could dig deep.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.371
I just don't actually think
I can resist the temptation

29:32.404 --> 29:33.505
of missing this.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.908
Okay, all right, well,
I'm gonna be home in an hour,

29:35.942 --> 29:37.944
you can borrow
just a couple of things.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.220

- Hi.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.355
- Should I take this one?
- Okay, so, wait,

29:49.388 --> 29:53.192
what exactly is this?
- There's a glycolic hand peel.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.127
Very gentle.
- So it's just gonna make

29:55.161 --> 29:57.196
our hands look younger?
- Exactly.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.330
It's gonna shed a layer of skin.

29:58.364 --> 30:01.300
- Okay, so, I mean, obviously
we are doing joint things.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.971
We're going a joint thing now.
You guys seem good?

30:05.004 --> 30:06.238
Fine?
Do you have--

30:06.272 --> 30:09.241
- She's the one
that doesn't like me.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.542
So I really don't know.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.945
- I'm laughing
because it's funny.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.947
And it's funny
because it's true.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.582
- I just--I do think
you should apologize

30:16.615 --> 30:19.218
for hurting her feelings.
- I don't want her to apologize

30:19.251 --> 30:21.387
though if she doesn't want to.
I don't understand--

30:21.420 --> 30:23.622
- I just know your feelings
were very hurt and...

30:23.655 --> 30:25.291
- Yeah.
- You were in that conversation

30:25.324 --> 30:28.227
with me, and you know
that I didn't just say that

30:28.260 --> 30:29.095
out of nowhere.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.864
I'm not trying
to be involved in, like,

30:31.898 --> 30:32.865
a group of friends that,

30:32.899 --> 30:35.167
like, can--that fight like that.
- Then don't.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.068
Don't be here, then.
- I never did.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.336
- I don't understand
what you're doing.

30:37.369 --> 30:41.440
- Because I care about Katie,
I don't give a f--- about you.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.409
I think what really hurts
my feelings is actually

30:43.442 --> 30:46.378
just the fact that you've made
it clear, like, you're not--

30:46.412 --> 30:48.014
I'm not somebody that you like.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.882
But you don't have to
make me feel bad

30:49.916 --> 30:51.150
when we're around each other.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.486
- I can kind of hear them being
like, "You hurt my feelings."

30:54.520 --> 30:55.988
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, they're talking

30:56.022 --> 30:58.357
about it, I guess.
- Stassi was crying yesterday.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.426
- Stassi doesn't need this shit
right now, though.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.560
I hope Scheana, like...

31:01.593 --> 31:04.496
- Well, I just heard Stassi say,
"You hurt my feelings."

31:04.530 --> 31:07.433
- Well, I can try to have
a more open mind.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.468
I feel like that's--
- That's really nice, thank you.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.504
- I will try to have
a more open mind, and honestly,

31:12.538 --> 31:13.906
even when we were,
like, painting,

31:13.940 --> 31:15.407
all I wanted to do was have fun.

31:15.441 --> 31:16.575
- All right, well,
then that's a good--

31:16.608 --> 31:18.510
Let's--I just wanna
have fun too.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.047
I feel like, moving forward,
Ariana and I

31:21.080 --> 31:23.916
are going to be fine.
We're not gonna be great.

31:23.950 --> 31:26.452
We're not gonna be best friends,
but we're gonna be fine,

31:26.485 --> 31:27.253
and that's good enough for me.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.955
- I think this was
a good session,

31:28.988 --> 31:31.257
both of you.
I'd like to see you again

31:31.290 --> 31:31.890
in one week.
- Look at you.

31:31.924 --> 31:35.061
- Group hug.
- Scheana.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.528
- Bring it in.
- You're allowed to be

31:36.562 --> 31:38.330
girly with us.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.699
- Then why the f--- are you
friends with me if I'm fake?

31:40.732 --> 31:43.535
I have said I'm sorry.
It was tacky, it was classless,

31:43.569 --> 31:44.971
I'm sorry.
- Calm down.

[upbeat music]

31:56.382 --> 31:58.484
- Lunch time, lunch time!
- I'm starved.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.419
- Do you guys just wanna
help yourselves with this?

32:00.452 --> 32:03.622
- Well, cheers, congratulations.
- Cheers.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.492
- Pandora, thank you so much.
- Cheers.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.260
- Cheers.
- Your house, goals.

32:08.294 --> 32:14.366
- We've had a good day.
- Did people say, "We're sorry"?

32:14.400 --> 32:16.102
- I don't want her
to say sorry today

32:16.135 --> 32:18.971
because when somebody's
pressured to say sorry,

32:19.005 --> 32:21.974
even if somebody is sorry,
it's kind of, like, not...

32:22.008 --> 32:23.109
- As genuine.
- Yeah.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.043
- Well--
- So it--

32:24.076 --> 32:25.644
- That's something
that we talked about.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.379
- That's something
that I didn't want to force,

32:27.413 --> 32:32.551
but something that I know would
make myself feel better.

32:32.584 --> 32:35.321
- Well, Ariana said
that she's agreed to be

32:35.354 --> 32:37.389
a little more open minded
when it comes to Stassi, and--

32:37.423 --> 32:38.657
- Do you realize
that makes it sound like

32:38.690 --> 32:40.059
I'm a serial killer?

32:40.092 --> 32:41.460
[laughter]

32:41.493 --> 32:42.394
What?

32:42.428 --> 32:45.031
- I just feel like
when someone tells you

32:45.064 --> 32:47.699
that their feelings were hurt,
it's just

32:47.733 --> 32:51.003
the decent thing to do.
This is a once in a lifetime

32:51.037 --> 32:54.006
thing for me.
It's not in my nature to--

32:54.040 --> 32:56.342
to be like "this is about me,
this is my time,"

32:56.375 --> 32:58.677
but it is.
- Mm-hmm.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.613
- And we've, you know,
chosen, selected the people

33:01.647 --> 33:04.116
that we want to really share
in this time with us.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.384
- But now,
everything's fine, so--

33:05.417 --> 33:09.388
- I just--I can't handle someone
that has any sort of negativity

33:09.421 --> 33:12.324
towards someone else
surrounding something

33:12.358 --> 33:15.161
that's supposed to be
a really amazing time.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.696
- I tried to make things better
between Stassi and Ariana,

33:17.729 --> 33:19.498
and that still wasn't
good enough for Katie,

33:19.531 --> 33:22.434
so I feel like literally,
I can't win.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.436
- I know I haven't been there
for a lot of the,

33:24.470 --> 33:28.707
like, bridesmaid stuff.
Obviously you mentioned to me

33:28.740 --> 33:32.144
about some things that just
made me feel uncomfortable.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.713
- I've gotten angry, drunk
text messages from Kristen.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.383
After the shower she texts me
immediately and goes,

33:37.416 --> 33:38.717
"So we're splitting this
three ways, right?"

33:38.750 --> 33:41.587
- I don't want you guys
to spend money like that.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.456
- I'm sorry for, like, anything
I've said that's out of line

33:44.490 --> 33:48.427
or, you know, that it was tacky
of me to keep you in the loop.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.563
- I have felt you kind of,
like, become distant,

33:51.597 --> 33:53.599
and I have been trying
to figure out why.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.202
- I love you, and I don't like
when we fight

33:56.235 --> 33:57.736
and when you text me
mean things.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.671
- If it's harsh, it's mean,
it's still my truth.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.540
- I don't understand
why Katie's truth

34:01.573 --> 34:03.075
is the only truth that matters.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.476
It's bullsh--.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.578
- You're drunk texting me
all of these insults

34:06.612 --> 34:08.747
when you drink too much.
That's the issue.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.517
- I'm tired of looking like
an alcoholic, drunk, like,

34:11.550 --> 34:15.121
insubordinate person.
I'm tired of that.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.488
That's bull--
That's some bullsh--.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.756
- But Katie, you turn into
a different person

34:17.789 --> 34:19.225
when you drink.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.792
- That's everybody.
That's not just her.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.027
It's not just me.
- I don't get affected

34:22.060 --> 34:26.132
by the alcohol changing the way
I'm speaking to my friends.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.701
She drinks, and then she's mean
and aggressive and irrational

34:29.735 --> 34:31.637
and sends me
all these mean messages

34:31.670 --> 34:33.205
only when she drinks.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.408
- Like, that is so unfair--
it's despicable.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.510
I mean, like, how more
derogatory can you be?

34:38.544 --> 34:39.745
- Well, it's not just me.
A lot of people say it.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.648
- A lot of people feel that
you're fake a lot of times, so.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.151
- Then why the f--- are you
friends with me if I'm fake?

34:45.184 --> 34:46.718
Don't be my friends.
- Scheana, you're suddenly

34:46.752 --> 34:49.221
acting like you're perfect.
- Really?

34:49.255 --> 34:51.523
- She's trying to apologize.
- By owning every f---ing thing

34:51.557 --> 34:53.459
I'm trying to act
like I'm perfect?

34:53.492 --> 34:54.893
I have said I'm sorry.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.196
It was tacky,
it was classless, I'm sorry.

34:57.229 --> 35:00.466
- Calm down.
- No, f--- this, God.

35:00.499 --> 35:01.700
- Oh.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.674
I don't know how I've gotten
to this place.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.843
My friends are constantly
disappointed in me.

35:11.877 --> 35:14.446
[knocking]

35:14.480 --> 35:16.182
- You okay?
- No.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.048
- I'll be back.

35:17.082 --> 35:19.218
- All my wedding events
are just tainted

35:19.251 --> 35:21.520
by f---ing assholes, so.

35:21.553 --> 35:24.623
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- I can't try any harder.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.292
- I don't know
what else you can do.

35:26.325 --> 35:27.826
- I feel like I'm going crazy,
and, like, I'm just, like,

35:27.859 --> 35:29.461
at my breaking point with her.
- I know.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.762
- Like, I can't.
- Maybe that means there's

35:30.796 --> 35:32.831
some sort of underlying--
- She doesn't like me.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.767
It's just a sad,
lonely place I'm in.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.469
- The thing is,
because I am so nice,

35:37.503 --> 35:39.538
but if you cross me,
if you f--- me over--

35:39.571 --> 35:42.241
- Yeah, you're scary.
- I will f--- you up.

35:42.274 --> 35:44.176
- I'm just gonna apologize
one more time.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.178
I don't think we're going to
accomplish anything today,

35:46.212 --> 35:47.479
and I don't wanna ruin
the rest of your day,

35:47.513 --> 35:49.481
so I'm gonna go, and--
- No, don't go.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.483
- Scheana, you don't have to go.
- Do you want me to stay?

35:51.517 --> 35:52.718
- Yes.
- Then, can we just, like,

35:52.751 --> 35:53.852
go talk, just me and you?
- Yes, yes.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.588
- Yes, we can, Scheana.

35:56.622 --> 35:59.325
I still love Scheana,
and I wanna be her friend,

35:59.358 --> 36:01.827
but if Scheana and I
are gonna be in a real place

36:01.860 --> 36:03.495
in our friendship,
I should be able

36:03.529 --> 36:06.565
to voice my feelings to her.
It's very frustrating.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.235
- You just, like, really
make me feel like

36:09.268 --> 36:11.837
they're just so many things
wrong with me that bother you,

36:11.870 --> 36:13.839
that I'm just like,
"Then why are you my friend?"

36:13.872 --> 36:16.242
- I call people out on things.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.709
I just like things
being on the table.

36:17.743 --> 36:20.879
So if there's things about me
that you wanna say,

36:20.912 --> 36:23.615
then say them,
but don't expect me

36:23.649 --> 36:25.351
not to have a response.
- Okay.

36:25.384 --> 36:28.320
- Don't make me cry.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.721
Because I do love you,
[indistinct].

36:29.755 --> 36:31.290
- I love you too.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.625
The second I see her show
a little bit of emotion,

36:33.659 --> 36:37.896
I'm like, "Okay, so you do care.
So we can fix this today

36:37.929 --> 36:39.765
and move on
with our friendship."

36:39.798 --> 36:41.900
Are you coming
to my pool party tomorrow?

36:41.933 --> 36:45.737
- I'm hoping I am.

36:45.771 --> 36:48.740
[upbeat music]

36:48.774 --> 36:52.278
*

36:52.311 --> 36:53.779
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.347
- Hey.
- We need help.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.249
- You wanna try on
my underwear, I know, right?

36:57.283 --> 36:58.049
- Yes.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.985
- As the queen
of accessorizing--

37:00.018 --> 37:01.553
- Queen of drag?
Was that what

37:01.587 --> 37:02.988
you were gonna say?
Okay.

37:03.021 --> 37:06.325
- The queen of glam,
I feel like you might be

37:06.358 --> 37:08.260
the person to help
these guys out.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.227
[laughter]

37:09.261 --> 37:10.829
- Let's go upstairs,
but I haven't got long

37:10.862 --> 37:12.264
to mess about.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.732
- Look, I've never
been to Lisa's closet,

37:13.765 --> 37:16.268
but, since I've known her,
she's always put together,

37:16.302 --> 37:17.803
head to toe,
dressed to the nines,

37:17.836 --> 37:20.372
and I'm just f---ing curious.

37:20.406 --> 37:23.375
Like, I wanna see that closet.

37:23.409 --> 37:24.576
Look at this.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.612
- Oh, my gosh,
your closet's like

37:26.645 --> 37:28.314
the size of some people's homes.
It was actually the size

37:28.347 --> 37:29.815
of my studio apartment,
just this part.

37:29.848 --> 37:30.916
- Well, where are you gonna
get the dress?

37:30.949 --> 37:34.052
- I'm gonna go look around.
I gotta go bra shopping.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.987
- Bra shopping.
- Yeah.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.623
- It's really hard to be a girl.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.591
Not only to you have to,
like, pick out handbags

37:39.625 --> 37:41.827
and shoes and all this,
then you gotta put makeup on

37:41.860 --> 37:44.796
and earrings and accessories.
Pain in the ass.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.698
- This will fit you.
Try this on.

37:46.732 --> 37:49.301
- Oh, my gosh.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.802
- Don't tell me
this is the first time

37:50.836 --> 37:51.970
he's tried on a dress.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.305
- It's definitely not
the first time

37:53.339 --> 37:54.440
I've tried one on, so.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.708
- Tom really likes shiny things.

37:56.742 --> 37:57.709
- What about this?

37:57.743 --> 37:59.945
- It's seriously like
a kid in a candy store.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.079
- Let's have a look.

38:01.112 --> 38:06.084
- I think I have it
on backwards.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.087
- I think it looks good on you.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.089
It's not actually
quite his size.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.825
Let's present
Mrs. Jacqueline Taylor.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.961
[laughter]

38:15.994 --> 38:18.964
[upbeat music]

38:18.997 --> 38:21.099
*

38:21.132 --> 38:24.936
- See, how just gorgeous
your décolletage is, you see?

38:24.970 --> 38:25.871
- Oh, yeah.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.439
- Yeah, I never heard of
this Givenchy guy.

38:27.473 --> 38:28.640
- [correcting]
Givenchy.

38:28.674 --> 38:29.908
- Gimme that.
- No, that's mine.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.344
- No, man.
- I only wear Givenchy.

38:32.378 --> 38:33.879
- If the guys
are gonna be women,

38:33.912 --> 38:35.481
then they're gonna need
to step it up.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.483
You need something
like these glasses.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.650
- Don't worry,
I won't take them.

38:38.684 --> 38:42.354
- This is the kind of gift
that blackmails are made of.

38:42.388 --> 38:44.356
Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

38:44.390 --> 38:48.660
- I even quite fancy you myself.
- Oh, Tom, look at you.

38:48.694 --> 38:49.761
- You gotta tease them
a little bit.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.397
- Yeah, do that.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.032
- You knock that sh-- off.
- Okay.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.101
- Knock it off
right f---ing now.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.168
- Can I respond?
- No.

38:57.202 --> 38:57.869
- I should know better
than to say anything that

39:05.677 --> 39:06.344
- * Glitches on my radar

39:08.580 --> 39:10.816
* Patterns on the sonar

39:10.849 --> 39:12.518
- Good evening.
- Hey, how you doing?

39:12.551 --> 39:13.785
- Hi.
- Could we have some

39:13.819 --> 39:16.555
salt and vinegar French fries?
- And I want, like, some tequila

39:16.588 --> 39:18.156
on the rocks with lime,
that'd be good.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.357
- Could we get you
some water as well?

39:19.391 --> 39:21.493
- Yes, please, thank you.
- Okay, okay, you're welcome.

39:21.527 --> 39:22.561
- Thank you.

39:22.594 --> 39:26.665
- I love your enthusiasm,
but I'm a little nervous

39:26.698 --> 39:28.834
and a little sad that
you're wearing this already.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.702
- This is f---ing gorgeous.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.471
Should I get this?
- Yes.

39:32.504 --> 39:33.338
- Okay, I'm getting it.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.942
I gotta say, I like it.
Daddy likes it.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.511
I'll never refer to myself
as "Daddy" again, I'm sorry.

39:39.545 --> 39:41.580
- Please make me a promise
that you're not gonna be like,

39:41.613 --> 39:43.949
"Oh, this is making me nervous,"
and take it off.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.717
- If there's hot chicks around,
I'm gonna take it off.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.453
- No, don't ever.
No, you can't.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.421
- I was kidding.
How was Pandora's?

39:49.455 --> 39:50.589
How was their--
How was the dynamic

39:50.622 --> 39:51.790
with you and the girls?

39:51.823 --> 39:54.893
'Cause Ariana was like--
She understands

39:54.926 --> 39:56.462
the bigger picture,
and maybe, like,

39:56.495 --> 39:58.864
she was a little cold,
but also...

39:58.897 --> 40:00.198
- Well, I understand that--
- You guys admit stuff

40:00.231 --> 40:01.800
from the story too,
like you guys don't

40:01.833 --> 40:04.169
tell the whole story.
It's hard for you

40:04.202 --> 40:05.437
to be objective.
- I was there.

40:05.471 --> 40:08.006
- 'Cause you let your emotions
cloud your judgment big time.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.641
- You were not.
This was my bridal shower.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.477
- I'm not defending Ariana.
I'm just saying--

40:11.510 --> 40:13.845
- It was my f---ing day.
I was there.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.547
You were not.
- Bubba, you're not listening.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.783
- So stop, don't defend anyone.
- I'm not defending.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.851
- This was my f---ing day.
- Okay.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.720
- And she cast a shadow
on this day.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.589
- Okay, don't yell, don't yell,
please don't yell.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.724
- So if you wanna look like
a f---ing asshole idiot,

40:25.757 --> 40:27.893
you can continue defending.
- I'm not defending.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.628
- Why are you acting this way?
- I'm not defending her.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.630
- You put that ring on
and you still act this way,

40:31.663 --> 40:32.798
like you're a f---ing enemy?

40:32.831 --> 40:35.867
Tom is enragingly charming.
Everyone thinks that he is

40:35.901 --> 40:38.870
just Mr. Adorable,
and he's so sweet, but,

40:38.904 --> 40:41.873
right now, I'm not interested
in dating Mr. Adorable,

40:41.907 --> 40:44.710
I'm interested in dating
Mr. Good Fiancé.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.712
- Let me guess, I'm not having
your back again.

40:46.745 --> 40:49.047
- For the last six years,
I have been my one

40:49.080 --> 40:51.650
and only support system.
- Are you drunk?

40:51.683 --> 40:53.752
- Thank you.

40:56.254 --> 40:58.657
I've been working myself
to the bone.

40:58.690 --> 41:02.661
Everything for this wedding.
I did not ask Ariana

41:02.694 --> 41:04.796
to be a bridesmaid
for a f---ing reason.

41:04.830 --> 41:11.703
She is a self-entitled, elitist,
like, stuck-up person.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.505
- It's called being
emotionally mature

41:13.539 --> 41:17.509
and learning how to
get control of yourself.

41:17.543 --> 41:20.045
- She's super cool, but I'm
the one with the problem.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.813
I'm not okay with that anymore.
- I'm sorry.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.682
- Knock that sh-- off.
- Okay.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.651
- Knock it off
right f---ing now.

41:25.684 --> 41:26.618
- Can I respond?
- No.

41:26.652 --> 41:27.919
- I should know better
than to say anything

41:27.953 --> 41:31.757
that doesn't agree
with your opinion.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.893
- All right,
I can't tell you anything.

41:34.926 --> 41:36.795
I can't tell you a damn thing.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.865
- Are you done?
- Yep.

41:39.898 --> 41:41.567
- I cannot believe
you're doing this

41:41.600 --> 41:42.834
to me right now.

41:42.868 --> 41:48.006
- * I'm ready to fly

41:48.039 --> 41:50.008
- She definitely drank today.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.678
- * Sandstorms,
I fought the war *
