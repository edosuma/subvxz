00:00.200 --> 00:02.530
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.530 --> 00:04.030
No one's ever done
anything like that for me.

00:04.030 --> 00:05.830
Professor Stone,
Simon White.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.330
We're delighted
you're considering us.

00:07.330 --> 00:08.830
I'm glad to be here.

00:08.830 --> 00:10.670
"Welcome to my parlor,"
said the spider to the fly.

00:10.670 --> 00:13.840
Coincidence you've been eating
here so much during my shifts?

00:13.840 --> 00:15.670
Just ask me out for dinner
already.

00:15.670 --> 00:17.090
Ben, you're not giving up.

00:17.090 --> 00:19.010
I haven't found
a new clue in over a month.

00:19.010 --> 00:20.170
Olive:
My dad's a great guy,

00:20.170 --> 00:22.340
but...he gets obsessed.

00:22.340 --> 00:25.010
We need to approach this
from a place of hope.

00:25.010 --> 00:27.930
Believe in the miracle
of Flight 828.

00:27.930 --> 00:29.680
Believe in the passengers.

00:30.890 --> 00:34.060
If I don't get what I need
from that box, I'm gonna die.

00:34.060 --> 00:35.690
Michaela:
He seems to think

00:35.690 --> 00:36.860
that whatever's in that vault
is gonna save him.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.400
So maybe
it'll save us, too.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.530
Ben: My portion of the Death
Date Calling was a peacock.

00:40.530 --> 00:41.860
It was the first step

00:41.860 --> 00:43.110
in understanding
we were going to die.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.870
All I've got
is eight months.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.370
We will find a way
to really save you.

00:46.370 --> 00:47.700
But you already have.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.710
Grace:
You love the carousel.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.880
What's wrong, Olive?

01:00.880 --> 01:04.090
I had another dream.

01:04.090 --> 01:06.390
Cal was talking to me.
I think it's a sign.

01:06.390 --> 01:10.100
Of course it's a sign,
honey.

01:10.100 --> 01:13.560
It's a sign that you loved
your brother and he loved you.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.060
It's more than that.
I know he's not dead.

01:16.060 --> 01:17.480
They're out there.

01:25.950 --> 01:31.080
Ollie, honey, we just talked
about this in therapy.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.910
It's been two years.

01:32.910 --> 01:35.460
It's time for us to move on,
both of us.

01:35.460 --> 01:38.920
Excuse me!
Would you like a reading?

01:38.920 --> 01:40.250
Oh, no, thank you.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.420
Can we, Mom?
Please?

01:42.420 --> 01:44.840
Olive  these things
are a scam.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.090
It's a waste of money.
Come on.

01:46.090 --> 01:48.300
Please. Just in case.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.270
Alright. Fine.

01:53.270 --> 01:54.940
Your father
would kill me.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.270
Hello.

01:57.270 --> 01:59.270
Hi.

01:59.270 --> 02:02.610
So, how's this work?

02:02.610 --> 02:03.990
Shuffle.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.280
And let the cards
soak in your true self.

02:09.450 --> 02:13.620
-I'm so happy!
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!

02:13.620 --> 02:15.620
I see you've been lonely

02:15.620 --> 02:18.790
'cause you lost someone
who completed you.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.500
Always look to the future

02:21.500 --> 02:27.680
with a possibility that
everything will turn out well.

02:30.180 --> 02:32.140
We need to order
more paper cups.

02:32.140 --> 02:35.020
Oh, Isaiah,
more are arriving on Tuesday.

02:35.020 --> 02:37.350
How did we do
anything around here

02:37.350 --> 02:39.810
before you joined us?

02:39.810 --> 02:42.360
Well, don't tell my parents, or
they'll add more to my chores.

02:43.570 --> 02:45.650
It's not like
they come here, anyway.

02:45.650 --> 02:49.820
Well, what's it like
living among the Returned?

02:49.820 --> 02:51.160
Not as glorious as you --

03:00.670 --> 03:03.590
Stay here.
Call Adrian.

03:03.590 --> 03:05.340
Hey! Hey! Hey!

03:05.340 --> 03:06.920
Stop it!
This is a place of worship!

03:10.390 --> 03:13.390
Woman:
Please leave your message.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.940
Man: Go!

03:39.960 --> 03:41.880
You don't sleep much,
do you?

03:41.880 --> 03:43.420
I didn't mean
to wake you.

03:46.210 --> 03:48.130
I didn't. I wouldn't.

03:48.130 --> 03:49.430
No, no, it's fine.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.550
Um, I should have
gotten rid of these.

03:51.550 --> 03:53.550
You're not the addict.
It's not your problem.

03:53.550 --> 03:57.390
I know, but I can
make it easier for you.

03:57.390 --> 04:00.940
It doesn't get any easier.
It just...

04:00.940 --> 04:03.810
At least now I have a reason
to be strong.

04:05.570 --> 04:08.070
We both do.

04:08.070 --> 04:12.280
And my alarm doesn't go off
for half an hour, so...

04:43.810 --> 04:45.480
So, first, you tell me
I have a Death Date,

04:45.480 --> 04:47.480
and now some magic compass
your sister found

04:47.480 --> 04:49.610
in a safe-deposit box is
gonna be the way we avoid it.

04:49.610 --> 04:51.820
Can we not use the word "magic,"
please?

04:51.820 --> 04:54.620
It's a built-in excuse not to
look for an explanation.

04:54.620 --> 04:57.370
Well, as long as it can save us,
I don't care what we call it.

04:57.370 --> 05:00.450
Those engravings -- They're not
part of the original design.

05:00.450 --> 05:02.500
The weird star
in the peacock?

05:02.500 --> 05:04.790
The peacock was part of
the Death Date Calling.

05:04.790 --> 05:07.130
So, who engraved it,
and why?

05:08.130 --> 05:09.880
Hey!
Hey.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.170
Have you heard what happened
at that church?

05:11.170 --> 05:13.050
No.

05:13.050 --> 05:15.010
How do you explain the things
that keep happening?

05:15.010 --> 05:17.640
Two of these so-called
Passengers hijacked a plane.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.060
One started a church.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.810
Another one
just robbed a bank.

05:20.810 --> 05:22.980
There are almost 100 of them
living in New York,

05:22.980 --> 05:24.980
and naturally,
the public is scared,

05:24.980 --> 05:27.520
which leads us to
this unfortunate event.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.400
This is never
gonna end.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.240
You guys just can't
escape the spotlight.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.570
Not all
it's cracked up to be.

05:33.570 --> 05:34.820
I can't say
I'm surprised.

05:34.820 --> 05:36.240
I mean,
when is Adrian gonna realize

05:36.240 --> 05:38.160
he's just
fueling the fire?

05:38.160 --> 05:39.990
And putting a target
on all our backs.

05:39.990 --> 05:41.750
The group's
engendered criticism

05:41.750 --> 05:43.750
since one of the Passengers
became their leader.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.750
Save her.

05:46.750 --> 05:50.760
We're reporting on the latest
on the Flight 828 Passengers,

05:50.760 --> 05:53.840
and we'll continue
updating you as we...

05:53.840 --> 05:56.510
I --
There were four guys.

05:56.510 --> 05:58.890
Um, I ran off.
I pulled the alarm.

06:00.350 --> 06:03.350
Is Isaiah okay?
I'm sorry.

06:03.350 --> 06:04.850
I bolted.

06:04.850 --> 06:07.560
I freaked out
when I heard the sirens.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.690
Isaiah will be fine,
thanks to you.

06:13.110 --> 06:14.740
You'll leave me out of it,

06:14.740 --> 06:16.530
when you give the police
the description?

06:16.530 --> 06:18.200
My -- My parents --

06:18.200 --> 06:20.120
If they found out
I come to the church,

06:20.120 --> 06:23.040
they'd never understand.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.210
No one needs to know
you were there.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.250
I got you.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.210
But you need to
let go of the fear.

06:29.210 --> 06:30.960
That's your parents talking,
not you.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.050
You've already
embraced hope.

06:35.130 --> 06:37.220
How can I help Isaiah?

06:37.220 --> 06:40.970
Find something --
a prayer, a favorite poem.

06:40.970 --> 06:43.890
Let your strength
be a beacon to others.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.210
Mm.

06:54.210 --> 06:56.670
Let me give you a hand.

06:56.670 --> 06:59.720
Way to ruin my workout.

06:59.720 --> 07:04.050
You're really not good
at casual, are you?

07:04.050 --> 07:06.390
What, so, now I have to --

07:06.390 --> 07:08.680
I got to apologize for
my mama raising me right?

07:08.680 --> 07:11.230
Man, why do I always end up
with the mama's boys?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.440
What was she like?

07:15.440 --> 07:16.770
Your mother.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.030
Hey, Tam.
I'm taking the Buick.

07:19.030 --> 07:20.530
Like hell you are.

07:20.530 --> 07:22.860
Last time, it took me a month
to get the smell out.

07:22.860 --> 07:26.410
You're becoming a fixture
around here, aren't you?

07:26.410 --> 07:28.870
Best breakfast around.

07:28.870 --> 07:31.040
Breakfast
is for regulars.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.710
Keep it up, and you're gonna
find yourself

07:32.710 --> 07:34.040
right off the list.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.710
You want a ride, Billy?

07:35.710 --> 07:38.250
I could have one of my squad
cars come by and pick you up.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.920
Okay, aren't you, uh,

07:39.920 --> 07:41.880
late meeting up with
your loser friends?

07:44.090 --> 07:46.050
You're one to talk?

07:50.140 --> 07:51.930
Your brother's
a real prince.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.440
He's not a bad kid.
He just...

07:54.440 --> 07:56.560
fell in
with the wrong crowd.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.570
Kids who fall into the wrong
crowd tend to become bad kids.

08:03.280 --> 08:07.070
What about guys who hang out
with sassy bartenders?

08:07.070 --> 08:09.080
What do they end up as?

08:09.080 --> 08:11.250
I don't know.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.910
Regulars?

08:13.910 --> 08:15.670
Hmm.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.460
Bowers really is pissed.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.760
Stuck us
with vandalism?

08:22.760 --> 08:24.090
And assault.

08:24.090 --> 08:25.680
I requested it.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.430
Any excuse to get out of
the precinct, huh?

08:27.430 --> 08:29.260
If the Xers are willing to
vandalize a church

08:29.260 --> 08:31.680
in broad daylight, who knows
how far they're willing to go?

08:31.680 --> 08:33.270
You worried
about your family?

08:33.270 --> 08:35.600
The only way to stop a bully
is to punch him in the face.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.150
Well, someone's ready
to eat the world.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.610
Let's just say
I'm riding a hot streak.

08:39.610 --> 08:41.280
What do we got?

08:41.280 --> 08:42.690
Perfect one for you,
Stone.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.780
Straight-up dead end.
No witnesses, no leads.

08:45.780 --> 08:48.370
Maybe you can use one of
your anonymous tips.

08:48.370 --> 08:50.450
Church doesn't have
any security cameras?

08:50.450 --> 08:53.120
They want to keep what they do
here on the DL, if you ask me.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.500
Where's the vic?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.670
In back
with the paramedics.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.710
Have fun with this one.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.340
Lazy ass.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.050
Well, let's just piss her off
by solving it.

09:04.970 --> 09:06.800
So,
according to Twitter,

09:06.800 --> 09:08.550
there was only one victim
from today's attack,

09:08.550 --> 09:09.890
but it was a man.

09:09.890 --> 09:12.310
The Calling said, "Save her."
Who is "her"?

09:12.310 --> 09:14.480
You sure it had to do with
what happened at the Believers?

09:14.480 --> 09:18.980
The only thing I'm sure of
is somebody needs my help.

09:20.980 --> 09:22.320
It's Grace.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.650
I'll give you two
some privacy.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.190
I'm gonna head down
to the library,

09:25.190 --> 09:26.700
see what I can find
on this art history book.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.070
Okay. Hey.
Grace: Hi, honey.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.700
Cal and I are hoping
you could pick up

09:30.700 --> 09:32.160
some DeAngelo's
for dinner.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.240
Make sure
he gets a Hawaiian.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.830
Pineapples do not
belong on pizza.

09:36.830 --> 09:38.000
Ben?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.250
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.420
I had a Calling
this morning.

09:42.420 --> 09:44.090
"Save her."

09:44.090 --> 09:47.260
You or Cal feel anything?

09:47.260 --> 09:50.260
No, nothing here.

09:50.260 --> 09:51.220
Save who?

09:51.220 --> 09:52.850
I don't know.

09:52.850 --> 09:54.720
But I got a bad feeling
about this.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.520
Did you talk
to your sister?

09:56.520 --> 09:59.020
Yeah, she's working a case,
so I haven't been able...

10:00.020 --> 10:01.190
Mom!
What the...?!

10:01.190 --> 10:03.270
Grace?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.900
Grace?!

10:18.870 --> 10:20.460
It all happened so fast.

10:20.460 --> 10:23.750
I -- By the time I got
my bearings, they were gone.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.800
I'm sorry.
It's -- It's all kind of a blur.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.970
Grace!

10:27.970 --> 10:29.380
We're okay.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.760
I heard the impact.
What happened?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.930
I-It was a blue truck.

10:33.930 --> 10:36.430
They didn't even
try to stop.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.390
They hit you on purpose?

10:39.390 --> 10:40.730
I don't know.
They were speeding.

10:40.730 --> 10:42.270
I tried to get out of the way.
But --

10:42.270 --> 10:44.940
Driver was probably texting.
It happens all the time.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.900
They side-swipe them
and just take off?

10:46.900 --> 10:48.820
Probably uninsured.
We'll keep an eye out.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.900
There's got to be witnesses,
traffic cameras.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.240
A truck like that doesn't just
disappear into thin air.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.080
Your insurance company
can request --

10:55.080 --> 10:57.490
Hey, buddy, can you just take
this a little more seriously?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.910
Look, my sister's a cop
in the 12--

10:58.910 --> 11:00.620
Ben.

11:03.420 --> 11:05.840
I think there's something wrong
with the baby.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.510
Sorry.
I didn't get a good look.

11:11.510 --> 11:13.340
So, you said
that you were in here,

11:13.340 --> 11:16.260
and then you heard a noise and
went out there to investigate?

11:16.260 --> 11:18.850
But you didn't
get a good look.

11:18.850 --> 11:20.930
Were their faces covered?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.600
No.

11:24.190 --> 11:27.270
Isaiah, we've met before.
Do you remember that?

11:27.270 --> 11:29.110
Of course I do.

11:29.110 --> 11:30.280
You're one of
the Returned.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.450
You -- You saved me.

11:33.450 --> 11:37.120
Look, I know that you're scared,
but you are safe now.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.370
We will protect you.

11:38.370 --> 11:41.160
I'm not scared.
I didn't see them.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.170
These men,
they are dangerous,

11:43.170 --> 11:45.330
and we can't catch them
unless you help us.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.170
Who pulled
the fire alarm?

11:47.170 --> 11:49.300
Did they get
a better look?
I don't know.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.970
Don't you want to see
the people who did this to you,

11:51.970 --> 11:53.300
to your church,
punished?

11:53.300 --> 11:55.970
It is not my place
to judge.

11:55.970 --> 11:59.310
Their eyes will be opened
in time.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.480
I'll be right back.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.990
Adrian.

12:15.990 --> 12:18.580
What did you say to Isaiah?
Why won't he talk to us?

12:18.580 --> 12:20.910
Michaela, it's not like
I have some superpower.

12:20.910 --> 12:22.660
These people can speak to you
about anything they want.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.580
And yet, they won't.

12:24.580 --> 12:27.000
You do realize that if
we don't catch these people,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
the attacks are just
going to get worse.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.340
Have you considered that
arresting them

12:30.340 --> 12:31.710
may make things worse?

12:31.710 --> 12:34.010
Especially if
you're the one who does it.

12:34.010 --> 12:37.840
If I do nothing, then I might be
next, or my family or you.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.680
Today was baseball bats.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.850
Tomorrow might be guns.
Do you see where that's going?

12:42.850 --> 12:44.600
I believe in
Gandhi's path.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.100
The minute we move
to the offensive,

12:46.100 --> 12:48.020
we become
a force to be feared.

12:48.020 --> 12:49.690
Then sympathy evaporates.

12:49.690 --> 12:50.940
So, this is
a PR campaign?

12:50.940 --> 12:52.360
This is about
instilling hope.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.360
To what end, though?
People are getting hurt.

12:54.360 --> 12:58.870
To a world that understands
and embraces us as a miracle.

12:58.870 --> 13:00.700
Embraces you.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.540
Donates to you.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.040
That's what you're all about,
isn't it?

13:06.040 --> 13:08.290
Okay.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.800
There we go.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.220
That's a strong heartbeat.

13:17.220 --> 13:19.760
So, everything's okay?

13:19.760 --> 13:23.270
Um, she appears
to be fine.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.980
Uh...

13:24.980 --> 13:26.310
Oh, my goodness.

13:26.310 --> 13:28.480
Did I just --
Were you not finding out?

13:28.480 --> 13:29.650
Not really.

13:29.650 --> 13:31.230
It's a girl.

13:31.230 --> 13:32.900
I'm so sorry.

13:32.900 --> 13:36.110
Don't be.

13:36.110 --> 13:38.820
Ohh.

13:38.820 --> 13:41.410
Doctor, we're in the clear,
right?

13:41.410 --> 13:43.160
I'd like to run some tests,

13:43.160 --> 13:45.910
make sure there's no
placental abruption.

13:45.910 --> 13:47.250
Oh, my God.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.920
There's no cause
for alarm.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.920
We'll just keep you here for
a few hours, monitor the baby.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.590
Okay?
I'll be right back.

13:56.010 --> 13:59.470
Hey.

13:59.470 --> 14:02.760
Through thick and thin.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.930
"Save her."

14:05.930 --> 14:07.850
Your Calling.

14:07.850 --> 14:10.600
The baby?

14:13.860 --> 14:16.110
I was a wreck, you know?

14:16.110 --> 14:19.950
Was hopeless
and powerless.

14:19.950 --> 14:21.990
Alone.

14:21.990 --> 14:24.280
Which I deserved.

14:26.120 --> 14:29.000
But now I've found someone
who believes in me

14:29.000 --> 14:32.210
and who has accepted me
with open arms.

14:37.300 --> 14:41.470
But I feel like a fraud,
you know?

14:41.470 --> 14:45.310
'Cause I'm still tempted.

14:45.310 --> 14:48.560
When I was first
in recovery,

14:48.560 --> 14:52.150
I also struggled
with relationships.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.860
I finally realized that I had to
feel comfortable with myself

14:58.860 --> 15:01.150
before I could be comfortable
with someone else.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.660
I'm trying.

15:02.660 --> 15:05.990
It's just --
It's not easy.

15:05.990 --> 15:10.040
A big part of that
was seeking forgiveness

15:10.040 --> 15:12.830
from the people I hurt
while I was using.

15:12.830 --> 15:16.040
I know, but --
How can we
start something new

15:16.040 --> 15:18.210
with the past
hanging over our heads?

15:21.680 --> 15:24.680
When you're ready, the next step
is to make amends.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.600
I don't know if the people
I hurt will ever forgive me.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.600
I don't know
if they should.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.560
It's not about them.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.770
It's about you.

15:35.770 --> 15:38.400
And moving on.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.070
Taking stock of
how far you've come

15:41.070 --> 15:45.030
and seeing yourself as someone
worthy of being loved.

15:48.790 --> 15:50.370
Okay.

15:50.370 --> 15:51.870
Ben.

15:51.870 --> 15:53.120
Oh, finally.
What took you so long?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.460
Sorry.
I got here as quick as I could.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.210
How's Grace and Cal?

15:56.210 --> 15:58.960
Cal's okay.
Shaken, but okay.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.300
Dad took him
for ice cream.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.260
Grace is putting on
her brave face.

16:04.550 --> 16:07.550
They're still running tests
on the baby.

16:10.060 --> 16:11.560
It's a girl.

16:15.060 --> 16:17.230
She's going to be okay.

16:17.230 --> 16:19.400
Okay?
I can feel it.

16:21.070 --> 16:24.740
Ohh, every -- every time
Adrian does another sermon

16:24.740 --> 16:27.280
or some idiot goes on TV
and invokes 828,

16:27.280 --> 16:29.660
these attacks ramp up.
It's just gonna get worse.

16:29.660 --> 16:32.500
There is still a chance
that it was an accident.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.750
It wasn't.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.420
I had another Calling.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.340
"Save her."

16:38.340 --> 16:41.590
Grace and Cal and the baby
were targeted because of 828.

16:41.590 --> 16:44.510
Now how am I supposed to
save the passengers

16:44.510 --> 16:47.590
when I can't even
protect my own family?

16:47.590 --> 16:49.100
Ben, it's not all on you,
okay?

16:49.100 --> 16:50.350
I'm going after the Xers.

16:50.350 --> 16:51.930
Vance is tracking down
the Major.

16:51.930 --> 16:53.520
Saanvi -- She's -- She's getting
close to the Death Date.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.810
Yeah,
I'm starting to worry

16:54.810 --> 16:56.480
we're not gonna
make it that far.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.360
Ben,
you can't think that way.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.270
Mick,
I need all the reports

17:01.270 --> 17:03.440
that the NYPD has on violence
against passengers.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.450
There may be some mention of
a blue truck or what --

17:05.450 --> 17:07.610
That is a long shot.
There is a lot of incidents.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.120
I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

17:09.120 --> 17:12.200
Mick, please.

17:18.790 --> 17:20.460
Okay,
I'll send them your way.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.500
Thank you.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.670
I got to go.

17:23.670 --> 17:26.550
Just...
give Grace my love.

17:37.310 --> 17:40.150
Hey.

17:40.150 --> 17:43.150
So, we pulled this footage
from an ATM

17:43.150 --> 17:44.690
a couple doors
down from the church.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.030
The perps
stopped for cash?

17:46.030 --> 17:49.070
No, not quite.
But check this out.

17:49.070 --> 17:50.990
Hello, good sir.

17:50.990 --> 17:52.200
What's he so afraid of?

17:52.200 --> 17:53.740
Just watch.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.910
Three guys
with baseball bats.

17:55.910 --> 17:58.670
Hmm.
These feel like our suspects.

17:58.670 --> 18:02.380
Yeah, and we got ourselves
a witness.

18:05.010 --> 18:06.880
Nice work. Get a patrol unit
to pull him in,

18:06.880 --> 18:09.010
see what he knows.
Alright.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.510
I didn't realize
there have been so many

18:11.510 --> 18:14.010
complaints by passengers.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.180
Mom!
What happened?

18:18.180 --> 18:20.690
Uh, some idiot hit us.

18:21.770 --> 18:24.440
Your dad thinks
it may have been deliberate.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.230
The Calling.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.070
Why would it warn me if there
was nothing I could do about it?

18:29.070 --> 18:32.950
The important thing is
we're okay...

18:32.950 --> 18:34.450
I think.

18:34.450 --> 18:36.580
They just need to
check on the baby.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.710
Your baby sister.

18:45.460 --> 18:48.380
Well, is she okay?

18:48.380 --> 18:50.550
We think so.
We'll know soon.

18:50.550 --> 18:53.640
How are you not
freaking out?

18:55.640 --> 18:57.060
Moms are superheroes.

18:57.060 --> 18:58.600
Ben: Hmm.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.640
Sweet of you to come,
TJ.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.730
Of course.

19:02.730 --> 19:04.400
You doing research?

19:04.400 --> 19:05.730
Maybe I can take over
for a bit.

19:05.730 --> 19:07.730
Uh, Michaela sent over
police reports

19:07.730 --> 19:09.740
on attacks
against passengers.

19:09.740 --> 19:13.240
And in every instance,
no witnesses, no evidence.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.160
Like what happened today
with the Believers --

19:15.160 --> 19:16.740
Mick says
no one will talk.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.250
Maybe people are
scared to talk.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.580
Yeah, maybe.
In the meantime,

19:20.580 --> 19:22.920
your mom's lying in
a hospital bed.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.130
Do you really think
it was related?

19:26.130 --> 19:27.800
I just don't think it.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.760
I'm gonna prove it.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.090
See this?

19:41.690 --> 19:43.440
Woman: Precinct.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.440
Yeah, he's here.

19:44.440 --> 19:48.780
Hey.

19:50.030 --> 19:51.280
Man: Hopefully.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.780
How's the, uh --
How's the case load?

19:53.780 --> 19:57.030
Pretty thin, ever since
my name came out

19:57.030 --> 19:59.830
in open court as a rule-breaking
obsessive detective.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.160
Captain hasn't exactly been

20:01.160 --> 20:03.790
throwing high-profile cases
my way.

20:03.790 --> 20:06.630
Look, I don't expect you
to understand about Zeke,

20:06.630 --> 20:10.510
but I didn't know
what else to do.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.630
Other than throw my name
under the bus?

20:15.680 --> 20:17.470
Look, it's okay.

20:17.470 --> 20:19.140
I've moved on.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.730
Good.

20:24.730 --> 20:26.860
Maybe you can let the rest
of the precinct know.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.360
It's hard enough
being an 828er

20:28.360 --> 20:30.820
without having to go up against
the blue wall, so...

20:30.820 --> 20:34.030
I think that's all in your head,
Mick.

20:34.030 --> 20:35.660
Do you?

20:38.580 --> 20:41.660
An Xer beat the hell out of
an 828 Believer,

20:41.660 --> 20:44.000
and the responding officer
treated it like a joke.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.210
I'm interviewing
a suspect now.

20:46.210 --> 20:49.000
Meantime, someone else ran
Grace and Cal off the road,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.210
and the uni gave Ben
a bunch of attitude.

20:51.210 --> 20:54.670
Is everyone okay?
The baby might not be.
They're waiting to find out.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.260
I'm sorry.

20:56.260 --> 20:59.390
The point is
Xers are hunting us.

20:59.390 --> 21:03.520
Michaela, the Xers are a bunch
of angry mouth breathers.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.350
Don't you think you're giving
them way too much credit?

21:05.350 --> 21:06.850
I am telling you
if someone doesn't start

21:06.850 --> 21:09.360
taking this seriously
and shut them down,

21:09.360 --> 21:12.190
the next 828 victim
is gonna end up dead.

21:12.190 --> 21:15.950
It might be me. It might be Ben.
It might be Cal.

21:15.950 --> 21:18.410
But, no, yeah,
you're right.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.450
It's -- It's probably
all in my head.

21:28.290 --> 21:29.790
Look,
I didn't see anything.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.040
Well, you seemed to be
in a pretty big hurry

21:31.040 --> 21:32.210
to get out of there.

21:32.210 --> 21:34.550
I was late.
Is that a crime?

21:34.550 --> 21:36.720
We got all day.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.720
What got you so scared,
Walter?

21:38.720 --> 21:41.220
What? You just see dudes coming
down the street like that,

21:41.220 --> 21:42.430
you get out of the way.

21:42.430 --> 21:43.970
So, you do remember something,
then?

21:43.970 --> 21:46.430
'Cause you're the only one here
in this photo.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.270
So, what?
So, what do they look like?

21:49.270 --> 21:52.150
Like, I don't know,
regular guys in hoodies.

21:52.150 --> 21:54.110
Regular guys got you
running your ass off?

21:54.110 --> 21:55.740
It was a fire alarm, okay?

21:55.740 --> 21:56.900
They were coming at me.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.280
Sorry,
which one got you scared?

21:58.280 --> 21:59.740
The guys in the hoodies
or the alarm?

21:59.740 --> 22:02.580
Look, that place,
okay, is freaky.

22:02.580 --> 22:06.080
And that thing with the plane --
it's not natural.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.580
Look, I didn't do anything
to any church.

22:09.580 --> 22:14.090
Did you -- No, I don't think
we said anything about a church.

22:14.090 --> 22:15.960
So, let's start over.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.930
From the beginning.

22:30.770 --> 22:33.610
That guy just got an upgrade
from witness to suspect.

22:33.610 --> 22:36.530
Based on what?
Another one of your hunches?

22:36.530 --> 22:37.940
He's lying
through his teeth.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.860
We didn't even suggest
he was involved,

22:39.860 --> 22:41.160
and he started
denying it.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.620
You pull a random guy
into the box

22:42.620 --> 22:44.780
in the middle of the day,
of course he's on edge.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.120
He's involved.
I know it.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.330
Then prove it,
or thank him for his help

22:49.330 --> 22:51.500
and offer him a ride home.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.560
Thanks for meeting me.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.350
You pop up out of nowhere

23:11.350 --> 23:14.310
after falling off the face
of the Earth for a year?

23:14.310 --> 23:17.570
Of course
I'm gonna be curious.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.490
I didn't mean to disappear.

23:19.490 --> 23:21.320
It just...

23:21.320 --> 23:22.490
sort of happened.

23:22.490 --> 23:25.200
It felt pretty intentional
to me.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.330
I never meant to hurt you.

23:27.330 --> 23:30.370
I know you were never
big on goodbyes,

23:30.370 --> 23:33.710
but after what we went through,
I think I deserved better.

23:33.710 --> 23:35.920
That's actually
why I'm here.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.170
I'm going through
the program.

23:37.170 --> 23:39.010
Mommy put you
in rehab again?

23:39.010 --> 23:41.840
No,
this time it was me.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.840
So, what do you want from me?
A gold star?

23:45.550 --> 23:47.600
I need to make amends.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.180
Courtney, I'm sorry

23:50.180 --> 23:52.020
for all the ways
I hurt you.

23:52.020 --> 23:53.690
I wish I could
take it all back.

23:53.690 --> 23:56.730
You make it sound like it was
the worst time of our lives.

23:56.730 --> 24:00.780
But we had fun.

24:00.780 --> 24:04.240
The only thing I remember was
us always chasing the next high.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.580
If that's what you need to
tell yourself...

24:08.580 --> 24:10.080
No, that -- that came off wrong.
I don't mean --

24:10.080 --> 24:12.040
No, it's -- it's nice to know
I made such an impact.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.540
Consider your amends made.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.040
I want to help you.
Please.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.630
If there's anything I can do,
would you please --

24:18.630 --> 24:21.210
I can take care of myself,
thanks.

24:21.210 --> 24:24.380
I had no other choice when you
vanished into thin air, did I?

24:32.730 --> 24:35.600
Good luck sticking with
the program this time.

24:56.750 --> 24:59.420
That is either
the longest page in history,

24:59.420 --> 25:01.920
or you are
somewhere else.

25:01.920 --> 25:05.340
I know what it is
to lose a child.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.310
I don't think
I can go through it again.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.930
You have to have faith.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.650
You have to look at the future
with the possibility...

25:21.650 --> 25:24.940
Both: That everything
will turn out well.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.450
Stay strong,
little girl.

25:34.450 --> 25:38.790
You have the best mom
in the whole world.

25:38.790 --> 25:41.840
But don't tell her
I told you so.

25:43.550 --> 25:45.670
Grace.
They're not random.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.340
What are you
talking about?

25:47.340 --> 25:50.140
What happened to you.
This recent wave of violence.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.850
The Xers are systematically
attacking the passengers.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.560
We ran the data.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.980
They're coordinating their
attacks to overwhelm the police

25:59.980 --> 26:03.190
and minimize the chance
they'll get caught.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.730
The Xers
are organized?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.150
TJ: The timing and distribution
of the attacks

26:06.150 --> 26:08.320
is too precise
to be a coincidence.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.660
So, Mom's accident

26:10.660 --> 26:14.540
and everything that happened
at the church, it's connected?

26:14.540 --> 26:16.830
Everything is connected.

26:16.830 --> 26:19.330
It's just gonna
get worse.

26:19.330 --> 26:22.170
I don't see
how this ever ends.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.510
We'll have to
go investigate.

26:30.510 --> 26:32.180
Okay.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.680
Olive,
what are you doing here?

26:35.680 --> 26:37.680
Everything okay?

26:37.680 --> 26:41.850
Okay, I have --
I have something to tell you,

26:41.850 --> 26:45.610
but you can't tell
Mom and Dad.

26:45.610 --> 26:48.530
I know what happened at
the Church of the Believers.

26:48.530 --> 26:50.700
How?

26:50.700 --> 26:52.870
I was there.

26:52.870 --> 26:54.280
I'm one of them.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.250
Good news.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.380
We found no sign of
placental abruption

27:06.380 --> 27:07.760
or trauma to the fetus.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.090
So, the baby's okay?

27:09.090 --> 27:10.380
Yes.
Grace: Thank God.

27:10.380 --> 27:12.390
But this was
no minor accident.

27:12.390 --> 27:14.970
You need to
take it very easy.

27:14.970 --> 27:16.810
We don't want any further
complications.

27:16.810 --> 27:18.140
Understood.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.230
Thank you, doctor.
You're so welcome.

27:22.730 --> 27:24.900
Well, that's it.

27:24.900 --> 27:27.110
I'm wrapping you and our baby
girl in bubble wrap.

27:27.110 --> 27:28.650
Well, I'm not sure
how I feel about that.

27:28.650 --> 27:30.990
We can talk about it
at home.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.580
I'm proud of you.

27:41.580 --> 27:44.000
Coming forward
isn't easy.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Well, when Dad said

27:46.000 --> 27:48.420
this had to do with
Mom and Cal's accident...

27:48.420 --> 27:51.590
You're gonna have to
tell your parents.

27:51.590 --> 27:53.470
No.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.430
I can't.
Please don't make me.

27:55.430 --> 27:58.930
Olive, you're a minor about to
identify a suspect in a crime.

27:58.930 --> 28:01.930
They're gonna find out.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.770
It's better
if it comes from you.

28:03.770 --> 28:08.270
No, there -- there has to be
some other way.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.110
Look, the number of times
I've done something

28:10.110 --> 28:13.110
that I wish nobody would
find out about...

28:14.200 --> 28:15.780
You can't run away from
your problems, though.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.280
It never works.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.200
Eventually,
it catches up.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.790
Take your time, okay?

28:28.790 --> 28:31.210
Just remember,
they can't see you.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.680
Number two. That's him.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.140
There were three more guys,

28:43.140 --> 28:45.350
but I don't --
I don't see them here.

28:50.150 --> 28:52.990
You're under arrest
for aggravated assault

28:52.990 --> 28:54.570
and conspiracy
to commit violence.

28:54.570 --> 28:56.530
You have the right to remain
silent and to legal counsel.

28:56.530 --> 28:58.370
Look, I didn't do anything!

28:58.370 --> 28:59.910
We have a witness
who says otherwise.

28:59.910 --> 29:01.490
And we've linked the attack
to other incidents

29:01.490 --> 29:03.410
of violence against
passengers of Flight 828.

29:03.410 --> 29:05.870
DA actually wants to
tack on conspiracy.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.170
Look, I want a lawyer.

29:07.170 --> 29:09.420
You're looking at
quite some time.

29:09.420 --> 29:10.590
Unless, of course,
you know,

29:10.590 --> 29:12.840
you've got something
to offer us.

29:15.090 --> 29:17.260
No?
Okay.

29:17.260 --> 29:20.180
But if we get your buddies
first, then the deal's off.

29:20.180 --> 29:22.350
Okay, okay, alright.

29:22.350 --> 29:24.060
Look.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.600
I don't know their last names,
alright?

29:25.600 --> 29:27.520
They're just some guys
from the club.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.020
What club?
Where is it?

29:30.020 --> 29:31.900
We believe this is
the headquarters

29:31.900 --> 29:34.570
of a violent group
responsible for systematic

29:34.570 --> 29:38.360
and coordinated attacks against
the passengers of Flight 828.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.030
Last-minute assist by her niece
seems a bit suspicious.

29:42.030 --> 29:45.450
What are the chances
Stone's right about this?

29:45.450 --> 29:48.370
You known her
to be wrong yet?

29:48.370 --> 29:49.710
And the DA bought
into her theory

29:49.710 --> 29:51.210
about the attacks
being connected.

29:51.210 --> 29:53.300
Doesn't mean she's not
leading the entire squad

29:53.300 --> 29:55.050
into a situation
she can't control.

29:55.050 --> 29:56.470
Well,
we can't call it off now,

29:56.470 --> 29:58.130
or it'll look like
whistleblower retribution

29:58.130 --> 29:59.720
for her turning
against you.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.600
...nightmare full of blind spots
and dead ends,

30:01.600 --> 30:03.100
and it's their home turf,

30:03.100 --> 30:04.720
so surprise is gonna be key
to our success.

30:04.720 --> 30:08.560
Everyone on site is considered
armed and suspect.

30:13.900 --> 30:16.490
I just realized I've been
so focused on the Major

30:16.490 --> 30:18.650
and the Death Date, I...

30:18.650 --> 30:21.070
I didn't
see the Xers coming.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.410
It's over now, Ben.

30:22.410 --> 30:24.330
It's not.

30:24.330 --> 30:26.500
The Calling said, "Save her."
I didn't save anyone.

30:26.500 --> 30:29.080
We just got incredibly lucky,
Grace.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.580
No, there's something
we're missing.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.750
The Xers
are still out there.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.420
Adrian is
making things worse.

30:35.420 --> 30:39.300
I-I don't know how Mick
convinced a Believer to help.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.430
Olive: It was me.

30:43.510 --> 30:44.930
I was at the church
this morning.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.810
I saw everything.

30:46.810 --> 30:49.440
What were you doing
at the church?

30:49.440 --> 30:53.190
It was my turn
to prep the service.

30:53.190 --> 30:55.940
You're one of them?

30:55.940 --> 30:57.860
You make it sound like
I'm an alien.

30:57.860 --> 30:59.950
Olive,
the Believers are a cult.

30:59.950 --> 31:01.660
Why?

31:01.660 --> 31:04.160
Because they think that
a plane that came back

31:04.160 --> 31:06.490
5 1/2 years later
is a miracle?

31:06.490 --> 31:10.040
Millions of people believe stuff
that they have never seen,

31:10.040 --> 31:13.130
but we all saw 828,
and it was a miracle.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.130
Yeah, maybe it was.

31:15.130 --> 31:18.130
Or maybe it was
an extraterrestrial encounter.

31:18.130 --> 31:20.220
Or maybe we got stuck
in a time loop

31:20.220 --> 31:21.970
that stopped
the aging process

31:21.970 --> 31:24.720
and expanded our brain capacity
so we could predict the future.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.350
We have no idea, Olive.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.220
And Adrian --
Adrian doesn't, either.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.140
That doesn't invalidate
his teachings.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.190
No, no, no.
He's entitled to his opinions.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.980
What he's not entitled to
is taking advantage of us.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.980
He's using 828 to put money
in his pocket,

31:36.980 --> 31:38.650
and in the process,

31:38.650 --> 31:40.570
making the rest of the world
scared to death of us.

31:40.570 --> 31:43.160
The rest of the world
needs to open their eyes!

31:43.160 --> 31:44.700
And what church
doesn't raise money?

31:44.700 --> 31:46.660
No, no,
this is different.

31:46.660 --> 31:51.500
Olive, sometimes people exploit
a difficult situation.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.000
No, sometimes people are
way too narrow-minded

31:54.000 --> 31:55.380
to see what is
right in front of them.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.380
That is not fair.
Is it fair to just tell me

31:57.380 --> 31:59.670
to accept the Death Date
and give up?!

31:59.670 --> 32:02.170
I didn't give up when people
thought you and Cal were dead,

32:02.170 --> 32:03.760
and here you are!

32:03.760 --> 32:06.390
Same with Mom
and the baby.

32:06.390 --> 32:09.220
Do-- Don't you see?

32:10.770 --> 32:12.520
No.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.600
I do.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.690
And I love that
you're looking for answers.

32:16.690 --> 32:18.520
I do. So am I.
And I'm not gonna stop.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.030
No one is giving up.

32:21.030 --> 32:24.360
But your mother and Cal
were targeted.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.740
Olive,
they could have died.

32:25.740 --> 32:27.120
And that's
Adrian's fault?

32:27.120 --> 32:28.740
It is!

32:28.740 --> 32:31.450
Look, it might be the Xers who
are physically attacking us,

32:31.450 --> 32:35.080
but it's the Believers
who are creating this hatred

32:35.080 --> 32:37.540
and fear by insisting
passengers are different

32:37.540 --> 32:38.750
from regular human beings!

32:38.750 --> 32:40.590
You are different!

32:40.590 --> 32:42.210
Olive.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.220
We are just trying
to protect you.

32:44.220 --> 32:46.470
I'm sick of
being protected!

32:46.470 --> 32:48.970
And I'm sick of
being afraid!

32:48.970 --> 32:50.220
And you may not like it,

32:50.220 --> 32:53.230
but while you were gone,
I grew up!

33:03.440 --> 33:04.900
We sure
this is a good idea?

33:04.900 --> 33:07.240
A lot of these guys aren't
exactly "Team Michaela."

33:07.240 --> 33:09.580
There's a big difference between
dirty looks and friendly fire.

33:09.580 --> 33:11.160
All it takes is one guy
not having your back.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.330
Do you have my back?
Of course I do.

33:12.330 --> 33:13.830
That's all I need.

33:13.830 --> 33:15.410
Back entrance set.
Man: Proceed with caution.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.460
-Let's do it.
-Let's get some bad guys.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.320
NYPD!
Hands where we can see them!

33:45.360 --> 33:46.950
Man: All clear.

33:46.950 --> 33:49.280
Back room clear.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.990
Clear.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.990
Clear.
We have them all clear.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.460
Man #2: I got nothing.

34:02.630 --> 34:04.460
Seems like
we just missed them.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.510
We'll get them next time.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.800
We'll get somebody
this time.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.350
10 bucks says that's the truck
that hit my sister-in-law.

34:14.180 --> 34:15.640
Take some paint.
Bring it to the lab.

34:15.640 --> 34:17.390
When it matches,
bring the owner in.

34:20.980 --> 34:22.820
Looks like Walter sold you
a bill of goods.

34:22.820 --> 34:23.980
No, ma'am.
This is the right place.

34:23.980 --> 34:25.320
That truck was involved in

34:25.320 --> 34:27.150
a hit-and-run with
another passenger.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.650
And you know this how?
Because
it was my sister-in-law.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.030
More family members.

34:30.030 --> 34:31.530
God, I knew I shouldn't have
given you this case.

34:31.530 --> 34:33.410
They were here.
Okay, somebody tipped them off,

34:33.410 --> 34:35.160
and whoever it was,
was at the precinct

34:35.160 --> 34:36.910
'cause they were
the only ones who --

34:36.910 --> 34:38.410
Okay, Stone, you are woefully
short on friends as it is,

34:38.410 --> 34:40.540
and accusations like that,
without any proof,

34:40.540 --> 34:41.880
aren't gonna do you
any good.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.500
Captain.
We have a leak!

34:50.880 --> 34:53.100
Tamara:
No refunds for warm beer.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.180
It was cold when I served it.

34:56.350 --> 34:58.520
Proper drink
for my friend.

34:58.520 --> 35:03.190
That, uh, single malt that
you hide behind the counter.

35:06.030 --> 35:07.940
Are we celebrating?

35:07.940 --> 35:10.860
I'm man enough to admit
when I'm wrong.

35:10.860 --> 35:12.870
You did us a solid today.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.620
I didn't do that for you.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.540
I did it for her.

35:19.540 --> 35:21.250
The trek to Rikers
from here sucks.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.130
Hey, what do you say
we go out tonight?

35:29.130 --> 35:33.050
'Cause a friend of mine wants
to show you his appreciation.

35:33.050 --> 35:35.430
Why not?

35:35.430 --> 35:38.560
A friend of yours
is a friend of mine.

35:39.890 --> 35:42.100
Salut.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.940
I thought eventually, people
would realize we were normal,

35:44.940 --> 35:48.150
and the hate would disappear,
but it seems to be the opposite.

35:48.150 --> 35:51.240
You just gotta keep doing
what you're doing.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.740
The bigots will give in
before you do.

35:53.740 --> 35:56.280
Are you, uh,
calling me stubborn?

35:56.280 --> 35:59.410
Determined, maybe.

35:59.410 --> 36:00.830
It's good, though.

36:00.830 --> 36:02.000
Got me out of jail.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.290
Best decision I ever made.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.670
You sure what happened today
didn't have anything to do with

36:10.670 --> 36:13.130
you burning down the precinct
to set me free?

36:13.130 --> 36:14.590
I don't care.
It was worth it.

36:17.430 --> 36:19.600
Enough about me, though.
How was your meeting?

36:19.600 --> 36:21.930
Good.
Making progress.

36:32.780 --> 36:34.820
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to bother you.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.160
But is Zeke here?

36:37.160 --> 36:39.870
Court.
How did you...?

36:39.870 --> 36:42.290
Your mom told me
where to find you.

36:42.290 --> 36:44.670
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.840
Hi. I'm Michaela.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.840
Michaela,
this is Courtney.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.210
His wife.

37:01.810 --> 37:03.810
You gonna come up soon?

37:03.810 --> 37:05.190
Grace.

37:05.190 --> 37:07.900
You should be in bed.
Doctor's orders.

37:07.900 --> 37:11.730
You don't get to have a monopoly
on parental concern.

37:11.730 --> 37:15.150
How did we not know?

37:15.150 --> 37:16.990
I don't know.

37:16.990 --> 37:20.490
Teenagers have secrets.

37:20.490 --> 37:24.000
Well, she's not wrong...

37:24.000 --> 37:26.080
about me.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.380
Why are you putting this
on yourself?

37:28.380 --> 37:30.340
No,
I've been scaring all of us.

37:30.340 --> 37:33.510
I've been so focused on the
Death Date and the passengers,

37:33.510 --> 37:35.510
I...

37:35.510 --> 37:37.890
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

37:45.270 --> 37:46.850
What's this?

37:46.850 --> 37:49.440
It's the compass Michaela got
from the bank last week.

37:49.440 --> 37:52.360
This engraving?

37:52.360 --> 37:54.530
Yeah, we've been trying to
figure out what it means.

37:56.860 --> 37:58.450
I've seen this before.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.530
Well,
you've seen the peacock.

38:00.530 --> 38:03.580
Not just the peacock.
This exact image.

38:03.580 --> 38:04.750
On one of the boards?

38:04.750 --> 38:07.920
No.
This was before.

38:10.250 --> 38:14.380
When you and Cal were gone,

38:14.380 --> 38:18.880
Olive was always insisting that
you were out there somewhere.

38:18.880 --> 38:23.430
This one day, we were walking
past this tarot reader,

38:23.430 --> 38:25.100
and Olive was
so desperate

38:25.100 --> 38:29.810
and my grief was so overwhelming
I couldn't say no.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.240
This card.

38:39.570 --> 38:42.410
The star represents hope.

38:42.410 --> 38:44.580
The woman said it was
what her future held.

38:44.580 --> 38:46.500
She gave it to Olive.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.420
How is this possible?

38:52.420 --> 38:54.000
There's more.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.920
The reader said that we should
look to the future

38:56.920 --> 39:00.760
with the possibility that
everything will turn out well.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.300
It became like a mantra
for Olive.

39:02.300 --> 39:04.260
She clung to it.

39:04.260 --> 39:06.310
And then today,
when she came to the hospital,

39:06.310 --> 39:08.310
she said those exact words
to me.

39:08.310 --> 39:12.690
Maybe a miracle did
save the baby.

39:12.690 --> 39:16.280
Maybe this is all
a miracle.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.690
Ben, this is a sign.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.990
What if the Callings
are trying to tell us

39:19.990 --> 39:21.660
that there's a way
out of this,

39:21.660 --> 39:25.780
a way out of the Death Date,
a way out of all of it?

39:25.780 --> 39:28.000
Yeah, maybe they are.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.290
But if Adrian
and the Believers

39:30.290 --> 39:31.500
keep turning the world
against us

39:31.500 --> 39:36.670
and get us all
killed first...

39:36.670 --> 39:38.670
what does any of it
matter?

39:38.670 --> 39:42.630
I'm not going to tell you
there isn't hatred in our world.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.720
Or deny the uncomfortable truth

39:45.720 --> 39:50.810
that there are people
who wish us harm.

39:50.810 --> 39:55.230
But I will ask that you trust
