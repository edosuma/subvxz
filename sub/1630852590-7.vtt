00:01.001 --> 00:03.712
Previously on Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

00:04.587 --> 00:06.631
- Have you seen Savannah?
- No. Not all day.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.591
I thought she might be
helping you out again.

00:08.675 --> 00:09.968
Savannah! Are you down there?

00:13.304 --> 00:16.391
It's the ghost sending a message
loud and clear.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.685
You don't have to leave tonight.

00:18.768 --> 00:22.022
Haunted or just cursed,
that place wants us out.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.482
- Anyone living in room 205?
- Why?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.985
When I was checking it out,
I noticed it seemed very cold.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.653
There's a ghost in that hotel.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.172
There's no telling how this is gonna end.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.907
Your family can't let
that slimy judge win.

00:32.991 --> 00:36.286
- You got the document for their farm?
- If you mean the original,

00:36.369 --> 00:37.787
it can go out with tonight's trash.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.622
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.226
You need to switch with Harper
and make sure she gets back here.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.645
There's something
you need to know about the farm.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.047
The judge tricked your dad
with a switch of the documents.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.341
Take this inside,
and the land stays yours forever.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.134
Only it's not what you're going to do.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.303
In fact,
that's the last thing you're going to do.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.182
If what you're saying is true,

00:57.265 --> 00:59.768
that document will allow us
to stay on our property.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.978
Harper, come on. Give it to Daisy.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.314
- Wasn't that the plan?
- I'm changing the plan.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.442
- I can't give you the document.
- But I don't understand.

01:07.525 --> 01:08.651
It's too big a risk.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.363
If we change things in 1930,
the future will be altered.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.174
Yes, the farm would stay
in the Tremont family,

01:13.198 --> 01:15.116
but you'd grow up
a completely different person.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.536
Maybe you'd never get married.
Maybe you'd never have children.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.830
The entire Tremont lineage
would be interrupted.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.832
And you and your brother
would never be born.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.250
Griffin said the same thing.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.878
Harper,
you're just thinking about this now?

01:26.961 --> 01:29.881
- Why did we swipe it in the first place?
- You have to go back.

01:29.964 --> 01:32.092
Live your life. It will all work out.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.070
Your father only wants
what's best for you and Sam.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.429
But my mother will be trapped
in that hotel forever.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.764
Not forever.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.057
I promise.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.939
Strange saying goodbye
to someone who hasn't even been born yet.

01:46.022 --> 01:49.567
I so want more time with you,
my great-granddaughter.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.902
I want the same thing.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.116
Okay, you two, don't be bashful.
Hug it out.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.916
Pretty obvious
Dad believes in ghosts now.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.501
All that yelling proves it.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.878
That was so cool
when he took on the ghost.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.880
You believe now too, right, Mom?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.048
Pretty much.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.718
- I'll loan you my hat if you want.
- Uh, I'll let you know.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.638
Meanwhile, I think our ghost is on notice,
thanks to your dad.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.267
- Or he made her mad.
- Her? Why do you think it's a woman?

02:22.350 --> 02:24.769
We don't, really. It goes back and forth.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.023
One day she's a "she,"
the next he's a "he,"

02:28.106 --> 02:29.858
or our favorite, "it."

02:30.692 --> 02:31.901
Covers all the bases.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.571
If there was just some way
to free her from that mirror…

02:34.654 --> 02:36.322
That's where Topher says she's trapped.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.075
You wouldn't have any ideas,
would you, Mom?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.369
I mean, like, how to untrap her,

02:41.453 --> 02:43.288
or detrap her,

02:43.371 --> 02:45.081
or whatever the word is.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.791
I'll give it some thought.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.626
Meantime, you two need to get to sleep.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.836
It's been a long day.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.715
- On or off?
- What do you think?

02:54.841 --> 02:56.176
Sleep tight, you two.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.970
As if any of us will sleep.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.901
Hey. Twins in bed?

03:13.485 --> 03:15.737
Uh, half of them.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.031
Wyatt's on the floor.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.494
You know,
it actually feels calm around here,

03:22.577 --> 03:25.580
like, kinda peaceful.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.749
Do you trust it?

03:30.293 --> 03:31.586
Not for a second.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.844
Daisy! What are you still doing here?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.688
You were supposed to switch back
with Harper.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.432
- I know, and...
- This is crazy!

03:44.516 --> 03:47.310
You know what Harper means to me
and how much I need her back here.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.187
I know now.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.731
Wait a second.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.692
You're Harper?

03:53.775 --> 03:56.111
Yeah.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.447
You're home.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.657
I'm home.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.607
All right, everyone.
I'm sure it'll be fine. Excitement's over.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.867
There you are!

04:43.950 --> 04:45.952
- Is everything all right?
- I'm fine.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.915
- What happened?
- Sam took a fall down the basement stairs.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.917
- Oh, no.
- He's unconscious.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.711
Nasty bump on the head.

04:54.794 --> 04:58.173
After all the times he's been down
those stairs, it seems crazy he fell.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.009
- He'll be all right.
- Mom, I really need to see him.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.302
In time.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.637
No, you don't understand.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.973
I have to. Right away.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.393
Wait. So Savannah was in 1930?

05:10.477 --> 05:13.521
She'd intercepted a note in the floorboard
I'd put there for you,

05:13.605 --> 05:15.148
that I was stuck in 1930.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.775
Then grown-up Sam finished the radio,

05:16.858 --> 05:19.527
and Savannah was able
to open the portal and come through.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.404
I guess her idea was to rescue me.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.697
Everyone's idea.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.784
You'll never believe
what I found out in 1930.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.870
The land, the house and the springs
were stolen from my relatives,

05:28.953 --> 05:29.954
the Tremonts.

05:30.038 --> 05:34.042
This judge was behind it and probably
the one who turned it into a hotel.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.377
Okay, I wanna hear all this,

05:35.460 --> 05:38.100
but we've got to get up there
before someone else finds this place.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.382
Wait. Someone else? Who else?

05:40.465 --> 05:43.927
- Your brother.
- Topher? He was in the bunker?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.428
And he swiped the crystal.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.847
- Which is how I got stuck.
- Right.

05:47.931 --> 05:51.393
Anyway, you've got your long story,
I've got mine, and both will have to wait.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.644
After you.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.694
You're not finished, are you?

06:03.530 --> 06:07.033
Please leave my family alone.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.539
I know you're hiding in there.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.504
You talked to me before.
Just talk to me again.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.843
Tell me what we can do to help you.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.942
Your mom was talking to the mirror.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.694
She knows?

06:43.361 --> 06:44.529
My dad too.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.287
Do they know its history? That it's Grace?

06:52.787 --> 06:55.248
No, but we almost had a fire today.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.126
Fire trucks, lots of smoke.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.295
What?

07:00.378 --> 07:04.299
Remember when I told you about my dream,
that nightmare about smoke and a fire?

07:04.382 --> 07:06.843
Sure.
The day you switched places and got stuck.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.764
In 1930, I learned it wasn't a dream,
it was a vision.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.016
I had more too.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.477
Glimpses of the future, of things to come.

07:16.061 --> 07:20.523
I have this gift, the same gift Grace had,
of seeing into the future.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.151
Bad things mostly,

07:23.234 --> 07:27.781
like the smoke and fire
that I thought was gonna be in 1930,

07:27.864 --> 07:29.491
but it must've been in the present.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.909
The Tremont now.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.912
No one found any fire.
They couldn't explain it.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.959
Wow. You've been to the past,
and you can see into the future.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.630
- It's pretty impressive, Harper.
- Why, thank you.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.512
Excuse me.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.348
We're looking for Sam Townsend.
He was admitted earlier.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.141
Colored ward is that way.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.604
Still waiting on those test results.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.022
Can you check with the lab?

08:01.856 --> 08:04.651
Doctor,
you've just been in with Sam Townsend?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.444
- Yes.
- How is he?

08:06.528 --> 08:09.531
His vitals are strong,
but he remains unconscious.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.824
Time will tell.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.243
Do you know
where I can get his medical record?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.744
Sorry, I don't.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.499
Sam.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.251
Sam!

08:22.127 --> 08:25.213
Your time machine, it works.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.756
I used it, Sam.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.217
I went back to 1930 when you were a kid.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.428
I saw the hotel when it was the farm.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.014
I saw your father. I saw you.

08:34.556 --> 08:37.058
Honey, we have to go.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.019
The doctor said no visitors just yet.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.106
Get better, Sam.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.651
You have to see it working.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.404
It's a beautiful thing you created.

09:06.171 --> 09:10.800
It's all here. The sale of the farm.
The judge's plans to build the hotel.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.802
The healing springs.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.305
Delay after delay.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.806
Problems with construction.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.434
The judge went through, like,
six architects.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.394
Had to go to Baton Rouge
to find the right one.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.563
The first grand opening.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.523
1944.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.192
Fourteen years later.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.962
When you take a look at the false starts
and the construction delays,

09:29.986 --> 09:31.780
it becomes so obvious.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.198
The ghost of Grace was behind it.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.326
Ninety years of blinking lights,
cold spots and water leaks.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.329
- You said you had a way to free her?
- With this.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.581
The document that'll change everything.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.333
This is the original,

09:43.416 --> 09:45.436
which would have allowed Elijah
to stay on his land.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.921
The forged second document was used
against him.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.840
This is proof the land was stolen.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.969
Which means the land still belongs
to the Tremonts, to my family.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.472
Explaining why Grace won't leave
the hotel.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.809
Anyone other than a Tremont is an intruder
and must be dealt with.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.186
Plus, I've always been drawn to it.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.772
My father too. Even Topher.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.108
And I'm thinking
it's because it's still ours.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.361
You realize my father's put his whole life
into that place?

10:14.864 --> 10:16.074
This is huge.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.868
One hotel, two owners.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.454
What are we gonna do?

10:21.996 --> 10:24.624
What we always do. Figure it out.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.796
And we're very close to finishing.

10:29.879 --> 10:33.717
Spackle, paint, a tricky furnace,
but the place has good bones.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.719
I don't know
if you've ever been out there…

10:35.802 --> 10:37.053
Sure. As a kid.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.514
We'd throw rocks at the windows and run.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.225
I'm sure you know
the place has quite a reputation.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.354
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell,

10:46.438 --> 10:49.899
you seem like nice people
and certainly very competent,

10:50.400 --> 10:51.943
but there's obvious risk here.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.821
I noticed you didn't mention
the recent fire.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.699
Oh, that? Mostly just smoke. Right, Ben?

10:57.782 --> 10:59.701
Yeah. No damage, aired it right out.

10:59.784 --> 11:03.038
Mm-hmm.
And lost a few contractors along the way.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.832
Some back pay is owed, I understand.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.376
- Any refills?
- No, not for me.

11:09.085 --> 11:12.672
Your passion
for this project is undeniable.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.426
But bottom line,
I can't recommend this for a loan.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.055
Thank you for your time.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.896
You guys okay?

11:27.979 --> 11:32.025
How could we be anything but,
after your incredible pastries?

11:32.942 --> 11:36.363
What Ben is trying to say is
that we may have just lost our last chance

11:36.446 --> 11:37.739
to finish the hotel.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.657
Why don't you join us, Jess?

11:39.741 --> 11:42.827
As someone once said,
"Misery loves company."

11:52.671 --> 11:54.381
- Hey, Sam.
- I don't get it.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.883
I packed this whole crate two hours ago.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.927
You didn't pull all this stuff out,
did you?

11:59.010 --> 12:00.303
Can't say I did.

12:02.597 --> 12:03.723
Maybe it was Papa.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.433
Now, why would he do that?

12:08.645 --> 12:10.897
I can't believe
we're actually leaving this place.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.234
Well, one chapter ends,
another one begins.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.444
Unless you're at the end of the book.

12:16.528 --> 12:19.823
Sam, I'm saying
you're destined to do great things.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.492
You have to continue work
on your special project.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.785
See it through.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.453
Never give up on your dream.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.873
Having visions again?
Looking into the future?

12:28.957 --> 12:32.043
Something like that.
Something just as cool.

12:32.544 --> 12:36.214
Cool? What does that mean?
Like chilly? Cold?

12:36.297 --> 12:38.258
Like magical.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.512
Knock it off!

12:43.888 --> 12:45.807
Every day a new Daisy.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.783
Is he...

13:04.617 --> 13:05.785
Is he gone?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.621
Not in the way you're thinking.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.541
He disappeared during
the middle of the night.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.919
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, would you?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.548
Actually, I just might.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.345
It's the best way to help Grace move on.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.513
In fact, it may be the only way.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.849
I'm not disagreeing.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.268
- You're not agreeing either.
- It's just...

13:30.352 --> 13:33.688
My parents have
so many other problems right now.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.775
Piling more on them just seems crazy.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.778
I don't see this as a problem.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.906
Like you said, we just need
to get it all out in the open.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.909
My mom's car. She's here.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.078
We'll have everyone together.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.080
Come on. Now's the perfect time.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.213
It's a document
that shows this land, the springs,

13:58.296 --> 14:01.466
all of it still belongs to our family,
to the Tremonts.

14:01.549 --> 14:05.595
Those signatures, back in 1930,
they guaranteed we'd never be evicted.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.766
- Where did you find this?
- Archives downtown.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.771
When I learned we'd owned the land,
I was curious, so I did some research.

14:15.730 --> 14:16.981
Griffin helped.

14:17.065 --> 14:21.152
So you're saying this land was stolen
from the Tremonts by this judge?

14:21.236 --> 14:23.988
- Technically, yes.
- Exactly. Technically.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.116
This is an old document.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.119
I mean, any lawyer could easily argue
it's no longer valid.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.914
No matter what our kids uncovered,
doesn't change things.

14:32.997 --> 14:37.043
I, we, everyone knows
how you invested in this place.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.545
It's your dream.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.506
It was your husband,
my father's dream too.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.468
That paper,
that lie has lasted generations,

14:45.552 --> 14:47.387
and we have to make it right.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.764
Ben, you don't owe us anything.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.057
Harper's right.

14:52.350 --> 14:56.104
If it's true, if any of it is true, we…

15:00.066 --> 15:01.526
we have an obligation,

15:02.777 --> 15:06.781
a moral obligation, to return the land.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.117
What happens to us?

15:09.200 --> 15:12.579
Guys, it's okay.
I mean, they're just figuring things out.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.123
Nothing has to change.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.917
Right?

15:18.752 --> 15:20.211
Wait, everyone.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.089
I have an idea.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.179
Now, hear me out.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.556
You need money,

15:31.639 --> 15:34.642
and I've been saving to buy a better,
more upscale restaurant.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.271
What if I put the money in here?
Into the hotel?

15:39.522 --> 15:40.857
50-50 partner.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.402
You'll have the money you need to finish,
I can have my restaurant,

15:44.486 --> 15:47.113
and we can restore The Tremont
back to its greatness.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.909
I mean, it is your legacy, kids.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.454
- You okay with this?
- Yeah!

15:54.537 --> 15:56.790
- Yes, of course!
- And yes from me too.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.126
Ben?

16:01.336 --> 16:03.672
This is...

16:04.756 --> 16:06.466
It's incredible.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.259
I vote…

16:10.178 --> 16:11.262
Take the deal, Dad.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.430
I'll second that.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.015
- Third.
- Fourth.

16:14.849 --> 16:18.186
- It's unanimous.
- Hmm, looks like a quorum, Ben.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.314
Jess, I...

16:22.565 --> 16:24.192
- We...
- I know.

16:24.901 --> 16:25.902
Enough said.

16:28.196 --> 16:33.410
So, what do you say we break out
some sparkling cider to celebrate?

16:33.493 --> 16:36.663
I'm on it. Wyatt, Zoey,
I'll need help with the glasses.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.207
I hate sparkling cider. Makes me sneeze.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.418
- No one cares, Wyatt.
- Hey, which room is mine?

16:42.002 --> 16:45.005
So, what do you think?
How soon can you get the contractors back?

16:45.088 --> 16:46.923
Now that there's a paycheck
in their futures,

16:47.007 --> 16:48.466
I'd say sooner than later.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.635
Well, Tremonts back in The Tremont.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.847
What Grace wanted all along. I hope
you're listening, Great-Great-Grandmother.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.024
Sam?

17:15.493 --> 17:17.370
"I've gone on a journey through time.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.122
Don't come after me.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.624
If I'm not back in three weeks,

17:22.751 --> 17:24.210
destroy the radio."

17:32.844 --> 17:34.137
2024.

17:34.637 --> 17:35.764
The future.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.441
You can rest easy now,
Great-Great-Grandmother.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.485
It's over. You're free.

17:49.069 --> 17:52.238
The Tremonts are back on the land
just like you always wanted.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.322
I sneezed, like, five times.
Now I have to pee.

18:34.406 --> 18:36.408
Really more information than we need.

18:36.950 --> 18:40.620
Is it just me,
or does this place feel different?

18:41.287 --> 18:42.664
Different how?

18:42.747 --> 18:44.833
Like, peaceful.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.918
Yeah, I'm getting the same vibe.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.921
Maybe because we all want it
to feel that way.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.013
Don't turn around, Zoey.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.305
No, turn around.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.224
Don't... Do... Don't... Do, do. Don't...

19:07.188 --> 19:08.565
You see it, right?

19:08.648 --> 19:11.192
It came from the mirror.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.444
We freed her.

- Agreed.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.670
They wouldn't believe us anyway.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.921
Is it over?

20:55.463 --> 20:57.716
Well, her spirit's freed,

20:57.799 --> 20:59.467
and there aren't any more ghosts.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.513
Yeah. It's over.

21:05.056 --> 21:08.810
Which means you can finally go back
to snoring in your own room.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.813
She is so gonna miss me.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.607
Heading home, Harper?

21:14.691 --> 21:16.401
Go ahead, Toph. I'll catch up.

21:28.538 --> 21:29.914
- So...
- I...

21:29.998 --> 21:31.958
You can go first.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.588
If it's not obvious,

21:37.589 --> 21:39.257
I missed you while you were gone.

21:40.550 --> 21:41.593
Like,

21:42.469 --> 21:43.553
a lot.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.473
I missed you too.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.021
I, uh...

21:54.022 --> 21:56.983
- I better get inside.
- Right. And I have to catch up to Topher.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.109
Yeah.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.072
- Good night, Griffin.
- Good night, Harper.

23:42.714 --> 23:44.716
Next time on Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

23:44.799 --> 23:47.635
It's our pleasure to finally say…

23:47.719 --> 23:49.971
Welcome to The Tremont!

23:51.431 --> 23:53.183
Finally found the key to 205.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.642
But it has that draft.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.579
We still haven't figured out
where that's coming from.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.646
That is not a little hiccup.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.982
Well, we can't close the hotel.
That would be a disaster.

24:01.066 --> 24:03.068
Sam went into the future
and hasn't come back yet.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.694
Crystal's cracking, Savannah.

24:04.778 --> 24:07.098
If you don't go home now,
you might not get another chance.
