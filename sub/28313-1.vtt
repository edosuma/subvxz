00:10.770 --> 00:11.603
Careful.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.303
Ryan.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.128
I don't think I know how to French kiss

00:17.130 --> 00:19.643
and I need you to teach me.

00:20.690 --> 00:21.788
Okay.

00:21.790 --> 00:22.838
Teach you how?

00:22.840 --> 00:23.838
Well, demonstrate.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.568
Kiss me and show me how it's done.

00:25.570 --> 00:26.688
Okay.

00:26.690 --> 00:29.578
Wait, shouldn't you be doing
this with your girlfriend?

00:29.580 --> 00:31.208
Oh, Evan?

00:31.210 --> 00:32.888
She's too polite to tell me

00:32.890 --> 00:34.808
that my kissing skills could improve

00:34.810 --> 00:36.941
but I know she wants me to be better.

00:36.943 --> 00:37.958
Yeah.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.188
Did she say something to you?

00:39.190 --> 00:40.188
What?

00:40.190 --> 00:41.078
No.

00:41.080 --> 00:41.911
No.

00:41.913 --> 00:43.848
She said nothing to be about
you being a bad kisser.

00:43.850 --> 00:45.228
She said I was a bad kisser?

00:45.230 --> 00:46.680
She didn't but

00:47.610 --> 00:49.468
okay, let's practice.

00:49.470 --> 00:51.613
Kiss me like you kiss her.

00:59.270 --> 01:00.327
How was I?

01:00.329 --> 01:01.162
Great.

01:02.989 --> 01:04.516
I am a bad kisser.

01:04.519 --> 01:07.447
Maybe you should open
your mouth a little.

01:07.449 --> 01:08.807
Relax your lips.

01:08.809 --> 01:11.402
You wanna go from here to here.

01:12.532 --> 01:13.365
Okay.

01:22.059 --> 01:23.187
Okay, it's like you're pecking

01:23.189 --> 01:25.937
Like, "mwuah, mwuah," little kisses.

01:25.939 --> 01:30.027
Which is super sweet if
that's what you're into.

01:30.029 --> 01:31.887
But that's no good.

01:31.889 --> 01:33.797
It's sort of like an extended version

01:33.799 --> 01:35.262
of kissing your sister.

01:35.264 --> 01:36.095
Ew.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.049
Yeah, it's not hot.

01:39.149 --> 01:40.297
Listen,

01:40.299 --> 01:42.927
open your mouth, relax your lips,

01:42.929 --> 01:43.932
follow my lead.

02:07.196 --> 02:09.836
Wow, that was amazing, is
that how it's supposed to be?

02:09.839 --> 02:10.757
Yes.

02:10.758 --> 02:11.947
You probably should've figured that out

02:11.949 --> 02:13.157
when you were like 13.

02:13.159 --> 02:16.227
I wasn't kissing a lot
of girls when I was 13.

02:16.229 --> 02:17.757
That's what boys are for.

02:17.759 --> 02:20.227
Lifting heavy boxes and
practicing making out.

02:20.229 --> 02:22.287
Oh, you're a wizard, I
can't wait to show Evan.

02:22.289 --> 02:23.817
Or is that too much?

02:23.819 --> 02:25.777
Definitely try it on Evan.

02:25.779 --> 02:26.612
She'll love it.

02:29.139 --> 02:33.057
So, this has been super
fun and not at all boring

02:33.059 --> 02:35.332
but I'm gonna go mingle.

02:36.293 --> 02:37.507
Why don't you go find Evan

02:37.509 --> 02:39.487
and show her all this fun
stuff I just taught you.

02:39.489 --> 02:40.320
Are you kidding?

02:40.322 --> 02:41.552
I have so many questions.

02:43.959 --> 02:45.263
Oh, look, my drink is almost gone.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.327
Why don't you get me another one

02:46.329 --> 02:49.786
and I'll go talk to people who aren't you.

02:51.579 --> 02:52.412
Ryan,

02:54.459 --> 02:56.697
you're the best friend a girl could have.

02:56.699 --> 02:58.217
Thanks.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.052
I know.

03:20.728 --> 03:22.728
Why are we hiding away from the world?

03:25.686 --> 03:27.346
Because I have the good shit.

03:27.348 --> 03:29.116
Out there, they have snickelfritz,

03:29.118 --> 03:33.246
and this, this is 27 year old
small batch Kentucky bourbon.

03:33.248 --> 03:34.866
And I don't like to share.

03:34.868 --> 03:35.986
Ever.

03:35.988 --> 03:37.238
You're sharing with me.

03:38.506 --> 03:40.876
That's because I'm one
generous motherfucker.

03:40.878 --> 03:42.671
I'm a god unto my people.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.746
This is older than I am.

03:46.748 --> 03:47.966
How expensive is this?

03:47.968 --> 03:48.799
Very.

03:48.801 --> 03:50.509
Costs more than your dignity.

03:50.511 --> 03:51.926
Well that's not saying much.

03:51.928 --> 03:53.119
Skol.

03:53.121 --> 03:56.288
Of course it is, it's got ice in it.

03:57.398 --> 03:58.466
Hey, lezlords.

03:58.468 --> 03:59.836
Hate to break up the gay-gay meeting

03:59.838 --> 04:02.611
but your girlfriend is out
there making out with Ryan.

04:03.478 --> 04:04.766
Really?

04:04.768 --> 04:07.386
I think she's giving her
kissing lessons out of pity.

04:07.388 --> 04:08.936
Good, let's hope it works.

04:08.938 --> 04:10.426
It's really sad though.

04:10.428 --> 04:11.886
You might wanna get out there and stop her

04:11.888 --> 04:14.406
before she embarrasses herself anymore.

04:14.408 --> 04:15.241
Okay.

04:19.058 --> 04:22.960
Listen, my dad gave this
to me when I quit smoking.

04:22.962 --> 04:24.646
Very expensive.

04:24.648 --> 04:26.648
Guard it with your life.

04:28.888 --> 04:31.736
Evan, you never quit smoking.

04:31.738 --> 04:32.888
He doesn't know that.

04:35.312 --> 04:36.472
You're beautiful.

04:36.474 --> 04:37.557
Never change.

04:39.018 --> 04:40.611
Hey, you wanna get fucked up?

04:41.526 --> 04:43.087
Yeah.

04:43.089 --> 04:44.901
Cool.

04:44.903 --> 04:45.736
Have fun.

05:52.289 --> 05:53.120
Hi.

05:53.122 --> 05:54.724
Excuse me.

05:57.857 --> 05:58.690
Excuse me, miss.

06:00.687 --> 06:03.625
I'd be careful walking around
with two premium beverages

06:03.627 --> 06:05.325
when this party's down to
six-pack of wine coolers

06:05.327 --> 06:06.565
and a bottle of Maneschewitz.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.050
We could attract some
unsavory characters.

06:10.667 --> 06:13.515
Whose premium cocktail am I drinking?

06:13.517 --> 06:14.810
Let me guess.

06:15.956 --> 06:16.787
The spoiled little rich girl

06:16.789 --> 06:20.195
whose external locus of identity
needs constant validation?

06:20.197 --> 06:22.995
Validation is
for parking, not people.

06:22.997 --> 06:24.728
Maybe the nurse practitioner
and soon-to-be divorcee

06:24.730 --> 06:28.205
who readily expounds upon the
virtues of anarcho-capitalism.

06:28.207 --> 06:29.855
I once dabbled in anarchism myself.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.445
Bear in mind I was 15
and obsessed with Crass.

06:32.447 --> 06:34.365
Say what you will about the
convenience of its tenets,

06:34.367 --> 06:35.720
but at least it's an ethos.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.192
Perhaps you'd go for
the very emo Jewish girl

06:38.194 --> 06:40.965
in the back room who's in
dire need of companionship.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.735
At least now we know who
brought the Manischewitz.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.568
What type are you?

06:44.570 --> 06:46.207
I hate to break it to you, miss,

06:47.077 --> 06:49.695
but I am completely unavailable.

06:49.697 --> 06:50.585
How unfortunate.

06:50.587 --> 06:51.875
Who is the lucky lady?

06:51.877 --> 06:52.708
Forgive me,

06:52.710 --> 06:55.910
I assume it's a women of
whom you are speaking.

06:56.977 --> 06:58.305
No apology necessary.

06:58.307 --> 07:02.244
And yes it is a beautiful,
brilliant, remarkable woman.

07:02.246 --> 07:03.077
Tell me more.

07:03.079 --> 07:04.484
Blonde hair, blue eyes,

07:04.486 --> 07:06.794
about yeah high.

07:06.796 --> 07:10.144
She's a medieval scholar
specializing in Dark Ages weaponry.

07:10.146 --> 07:11.924
She does sound remarkable

07:11.926 --> 07:13.574
and also very familiar.

07:13.576 --> 07:14.407
Maybe you know her.

07:14.409 --> 07:15.724
Her name is Bridget.

07:15.726 --> 07:16.814
That's my name.

07:16.816 --> 07:17.814
She's supposed to be here tonight

07:17.816 --> 07:19.704
but I can't seem to find her.

07:19.706 --> 07:20.914
Oh, this could be dangerous.

07:20.916 --> 07:22.304
She might see me flirting with you.

07:22.306 --> 07:23.874
Then what?

07:23.876 --> 07:26.154
Well, I'm sure she wouldn't
want me taking what's hers.

07:26.156 --> 07:28.094
I suppose I should seize
the opportunity now

07:28.096 --> 07:29.233
and kiss you while I can.

07:29.235 --> 07:31.574
I wouldn't want to
put you in harm's way.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.163
I think you're worth the risk.

07:44.548 --> 07:45.465
Yes, yes.

09:53.064 --> 09:53.897
Evan?

09:58.086 --> 09:59.274
Evan.

09:59.276 --> 10:00.295
What?

10:00.297 --> 10:03.565
I think there's someone in the kitchen.

10:03.567 --> 10:04.949
I think there's someone in the kitchen.

10:04.951 --> 10:05.784
Huh?

10:07.556 --> 10:08.939
Get my ax.

10:08.941 --> 10:09.774
Help me get my ax.

10:21.878 --> 10:22.709
Ryan!

10:22.711 --> 10:23.542
Oh my God.

10:23.544 --> 10:25.273
I didn't mean to wake you guys up.

10:25.275 --> 10:27.553
How is she in here?

10:27.555 --> 10:32.503
I gave her a key and a code
to the alarm system, sorry.

10:32.505 --> 10:35.095
Bridget, you look hot.

10:35.097 --> 10:36.385
Is that La Perla?

10:36.387 --> 10:38.703
No, I'd rather have Victoria Secret

10:38.705 --> 10:41.163
and an extra five hundred
bucks in my pocket.

10:41.165 --> 10:43.023
To what do we owe the
honor of your home invasion?

10:43.025 --> 10:45.318
Guys, this is intense.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.093
I've been poisoned.

10:47.095 --> 10:47.926
What?

10:47.928 --> 10:49.309
Yeah, someone tried to dose me.

10:49.311 --> 10:50.142
Who?

10:50.144 --> 10:52.823
I don't know but my
drink tasted really funny

10:52.825 --> 10:55.283
and I felt really weird,
so I left and came here.

10:55.285 --> 10:57.133
Do we need to take you to the hospital?

10:57.135 --> 10:58.364
No.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.532
I only had one sip.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.434
I just feel way drunker than I should.

11:02.404 --> 11:06.062
Okay, well what did you do
with the rest of the drink?

11:06.064 --> 11:09.042
I gave it to Dov and told
her to take care of it.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.172
Ryan, this is very important.

11:11.174 --> 11:14.642
Now what exactly did you say to Dov?

11:14.644 --> 11:16.537
I told her to take care of it.

11:17.924 --> 11:18.757
Oh no.

11:20.684 --> 11:23.183
We're leaving, now!

11:34.437 --> 11:35.268
What's happening?

11:35.270 --> 11:36.101
She's fucked up.

11:36.103 --> 11:36.934
Who knows?

11:36.936 --> 11:38.762
Rope, G, K.

11:38.764 --> 11:39.750
L-M-N-O-P.

11:39.752 --> 11:41.295
Oh my God, it's all my fault.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.862
I knew you
idiots had a hand in this.

11:43.864 --> 11:44.762
I didn't know.

11:44.764 --> 11:47.299
Someone roofied me and I gave it to Dov

11:47.301 --> 11:48.942
and I guess I didn't make it clear.

11:48.944 --> 11:51.222
Trista, you're a nurse,
what's the prognosis?

11:51.224 --> 11:53.192
It depends on how much she had.

11:53.194 --> 11:54.025
Just one drink.

11:54.027 --> 11:55.572
Shouldn't we call the police?

11:55.574 --> 11:57.182
I mean, we need to
figure out who did this.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.742
The police
don't give a shit about us.

11:58.744 --> 11:59.780
Is that true?

11:59.782 --> 12:02.132
Will she be
needing medical attention?

12:03.554 --> 12:04.672
Just keep an eye on her.

12:04.674 --> 12:07.392
You know, I can hear
everything you're saying.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.363
How is she still conscience?

12:09.365 --> 12:11.689
She must've not had enough to pass out.

12:11.691 --> 12:13.572
I have a strong constitution.

12:13.574 --> 12:15.772
I've built up a really high tolerance

12:15.774 --> 12:17.247
to controlled substances.

12:18.664 --> 12:20.214
Get those people out of here.

12:24.484 --> 12:25.315
Party's over!

12:25.317 --> 12:26.208
Everybody get out!

12:26.210 --> 12:27.041
What?

12:27.043 --> 12:27.874
Get out!

12:27.876 --> 12:28.707
Why?

12:30.070 --> 12:31.766
Out, come on, get out!

12:31.768 --> 12:32.635
Out!

12:32.637 --> 12:33.541
Everybody get out!

12:33.543 --> 12:34.772
We have to, now!

12:34.774 --> 12:36.405
No, no, it's too much.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.487
Out, out, now, come on!

12:41.753 --> 12:42.586
Come on!

12:49.351 --> 12:52.662
I don't know if I'm laughing
so much because I'm so high

12:52.664 --> 12:55.642
or because I'm dying.

12:55.644 --> 12:56.917
You're not dying.

12:58.114 --> 12:59.861
We're all dying.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.113
She's being fatalistic,
that's a good sign.

13:04.403 --> 13:05.236
That's it.

13:07.294 --> 13:08.786
Don't worry, girl.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.621
I got you.

13:11.373 --> 13:12.206
Evan?

13:13.453 --> 13:16.406
There's something really major
I wanna tell you right now.

13:26.693 --> 13:29.466
Did you know they had
bras in the 14th Century?

13:31.433 --> 13:33.779
Does that mean they
also had a second base?

13:40.115 --> 13:41.532
I have some news.

13:42.503 --> 13:43.366
My father,

13:44.293 --> 13:46.681
my father is running for Senate.

13:46.683 --> 13:47.911
State or?

13:47.913 --> 13:49.341
US Senate.

13:49.343 --> 13:51.091
And he wants me to be campaign chair.

13:51.093 --> 13:52.191
Governor wasn't enough?

13:52.193 --> 13:54.791
For my father, nothing is ever enough.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.651
Must run in the family.

13:56.653 --> 13:58.131
You have to do it.

13:58.133 --> 13:59.131
I will.

13:59.133 --> 14:00.741
There's one catch.

14:00.743 --> 14:02.801
He can't win as a Democrat again.

14:02.803 --> 14:04.401
This time he has to run as...

14:04.403 --> 14:05.651
A Libertarian?

14:05.653 --> 14:06.726
As a Republican.

14:08.383 --> 14:10.931
You can't support a
Republican candidate.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.161
I can if he's my dad.

14:12.163 --> 14:14.611
He'll be Republican in name only.

14:14.613 --> 14:16.001
He's a huge supporter of gay rights

14:16.003 --> 14:17.651
and everyone knows his daughter's a homo.

14:17.653 --> 14:18.566
A major one.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.831
What about women's rights
and abortion rights?

14:22.833 --> 14:24.348
And immigrants' rights?

14:24.350 --> 14:25.581
I'm not an immigrant.

14:25.583 --> 14:26.921
Your grandparents were.

14:26.923 --> 14:28.161
Someone's gonna chair his campaign,

14:28.163 --> 14:29.313
it might as well be me.

14:32.643 --> 14:34.031
I just don't want you to do something

14:34.033 --> 14:35.660
you're later going to regret.

14:35.662 --> 14:37.729
Regret it my favorite pastime.

14:37.731 --> 14:39.571
Every day I can pass along to him

14:39.573 --> 14:41.031
your Marxist feminist dialectic.

14:41.033 --> 14:44.638
Oh, I love it when you talk nerdy to me.

14:53.133 --> 14:53.966
Marry me.

14:54.943 --> 14:57.805
I have other plans for today.

15:02.863 --> 15:04.090
Oh, you taste so sweet.

15:04.092 --> 15:06.460
You taste better than being thin feels.

15:09.882 --> 15:12.550
Is there another intruder in the house?

15:12.552 --> 15:13.730
The very same one.

15:13.732 --> 15:15.670
I let Ryan in after
you crashed last night.

15:15.672 --> 15:18.010
She didn't want to sleep
alone in her new apartment.

15:18.012 --> 15:20.305
We're not running a
social services agency.

15:22.694 --> 15:25.920
I don't know about you guys
but I am ready for some vodka.

15:25.922 --> 15:27.175
Morning.

15:34.862 --> 15:38.660
So I get some phone call
from England, collect,

15:38.662 --> 15:40.980
and it's some nurse from some hospital

15:40.982 --> 15:43.960
informing me that my
father is on his deathbed.

15:43.962 --> 15:45.897
Oh, Ryan, I'm so sorry.

15:45.899 --> 15:47.460
I'm not.

15:47.462 --> 15:49.920
The old bastard has
been alive long enough.

15:49.922 --> 15:51.060
I'm ready for him to kick the bucket

15:51.062 --> 15:52.400
so I can collect my inheritance.

15:52.402 --> 15:53.600
I thought you guys
got along pretty well.

15:53.602 --> 15:55.690
We had a fabulous arrangement.

15:55.692 --> 15:57.740
He pays me five grand a month

15:57.742 --> 16:00.220
and his embarrassment
of a homosexual daughter

16:00.222 --> 16:02.678
stays on a different
continent and out of his life.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.550
Oh, I didn't know it was that bad.

16:04.552 --> 16:05.884
It could be worse.

16:05.886 --> 16:09.325
When I graduated, his initial
offer was three thousand.

16:10.752 --> 16:11.585
Hey, babe.

16:14.209 --> 16:16.440
Have a nice day, ladies.

16:16.442 --> 16:17.895
Where's my kiss?

16:22.072 --> 16:24.060
Hey, is Evan going to work?

16:24.062 --> 16:25.660
But it's Saturday.

16:25.662 --> 16:28.340
Wait, sorry, since when
has Evan had a job?

16:28.342 --> 16:30.299
Since her dad's running for Senate.

16:31.622 --> 16:33.215
And now,

16:34.712 --> 16:36.440
she's a Republican.

16:36.442 --> 16:38.230
Oh my God.

16:38.232 --> 16:39.780
She's a sellout.

16:39.782 --> 16:42.500
What happened to our
dead-dog-dyke-Democrat?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.320
She's rolling over and
playing conservative.

16:45.322 --> 16:48.600
And she keeps pushing me to marry her.

16:48.602 --> 16:49.740
I know.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.060
She won't stop taking about it.

16:52.062 --> 16:53.730
Don't you want to?

16:53.732 --> 16:54.950
Yeah.

16:54.952 --> 16:55.785
Just

16:57.052 --> 16:58.830
not now.

16:58.832 --> 17:00.489
You're gonna need some of this.

17:00.491 --> 17:03.309
Glad to see last night
didn't put you off your game.

17:03.311 --> 17:04.261
What do you mean?

17:06.751 --> 17:08.084
You got roofied.

17:10.281 --> 17:11.114
Oh, right.

17:12.871 --> 17:14.079
Yeah.

17:14.080 --> 17:14.914
Well,

17:15.861 --> 17:17.855
so here's to getting married, then.

17:17.857 --> 17:18.688
And selling out.

17:18.690 --> 17:20.188
Aren't those the same thing?

17:28.080 --> 17:29.259
Why does the universe go through

17:29.261 --> 17:30.924
all bother of existing at all?

17:31.761 --> 17:34.552
Having a bout of
existential despair, I see.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.184
What's the purpose of life?

17:38.281 --> 17:39.789
That's a yes.

17:39.791 --> 17:40.999
Well,

17:41.001 --> 17:43.529
most losers, present company included,

17:43.531 --> 17:44.971
would say it's

17:46.401 --> 17:47.839
love.

17:47.841 --> 17:48.672
Wrong.

17:48.674 --> 17:51.169
Love is a capitalist
scheme that is pre-packaged

17:51.171 --> 17:53.059
and peddled to the masses.

17:53.061 --> 17:54.329
It's the perfect racket.

17:54.331 --> 17:56.404
It's selling dreams for cash.

17:57.301 --> 17:58.159
I thought you'd be happy

17:58.161 --> 18:00.361
once Evan got you that
job at the newspaper.

18:01.441 --> 18:04.049
Typing up engagement
announcements isn't writing.

18:04.051 --> 18:05.394
Although,

18:05.396 --> 18:09.009
I would recommend it to our
government as a form of torture.

18:09.011 --> 18:10.709
You are so emo.

18:10.711 --> 18:12.011
You just need to get laid.

18:13.931 --> 18:15.031
Love is an illusion.

18:18.501 --> 18:19.551
So what is it then?

18:21.241 --> 18:22.072
What's what?

18:22.074 --> 18:23.759
Your original question.

18:23.761 --> 18:24.761
The purpose of life.

18:26.201 --> 18:27.099
I don't know.

18:27.101 --> 18:27.934
I do.

18:29.751 --> 18:31.239
It's to have as much fun as we can

18:31.241 --> 18:33.141
before we're all sent to burn in Hell.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.259
Up for some divorce proceedings?

18:55.261 --> 18:56.361
Nice to see you too.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.028
Good to be back.

19:00.030 --> 19:02.108
I like what you've done with the place.

19:02.110 --> 19:02.953
I guess.

19:14.790 --> 19:18.043
And here I thought this wasn't
gonna be an amicable divorce.

19:45.378 --> 19:47.453
Come in, come in.

19:48.902 --> 19:51.858
I don't think you've seen this
place since I've moved here.

19:51.860 --> 19:54.628
Business must be booming
in the tattoo industry.

19:54.630 --> 19:56.915
This world is full of un-inked flesh.

19:56.917 --> 19:59.368
I'm going to change real fast.

19:59.370 --> 20:00.698
Make us a drink.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.808
Or one for each of us.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.413
You know what I'm saying.

20:12.230 --> 20:13.808
Ryan!

20:13.810 --> 20:15.888
How are you affording all this?

20:15.890 --> 20:16.988
Oh, you now,

20:16.990 --> 20:18.638
things are going really well at the shop

20:18.640 --> 20:22.558
and my dad helps me financially.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.478
Bridget was telling me about that.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.748
She's worried about you.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.008
Why?

20:27.010 --> 20:28.383
I'm doing fabulously.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.023
Would you like to mix
that with something?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.170
I like it straight.

20:49.130 --> 20:51.113
Pretty much the only
thing I like straight.

20:53.810 --> 20:55.435
Have a seat.

20:56.370 --> 20:57.738
Tell me why I suddenly feel

20:57.740 --> 20:58.708
like I need to have a cigarette.

20:58.710 --> 21:00.359
I'm about to drop a truth bomb.

21:01.783 --> 21:02.677
In your own home?

21:02.679 --> 21:04.612
That's an act of domestic terrorism.

21:09.249 --> 21:10.162
Bombs away.

21:15.889 --> 21:18.172
Dov, you have a major problem.

21:19.359 --> 21:21.047
Why do I feel like
I'm at an intervention?

21:21.049 --> 21:22.749
Because I'm interventioning you.

21:24.439 --> 21:25.307
Okay.

21:25.309 --> 21:28.077
What's my drug of choice?

21:28.079 --> 21:29.657
I want you to know that I understand you

21:29.659 --> 21:31.637
better than you realize.

21:31.639 --> 21:33.827
I think about you all the time,

21:33.829 --> 21:36.367
about what your life must be like

21:36.369 --> 21:37.969
and I know what your problem is.

21:38.889 --> 21:40.617
This should be spectacular.

21:40.619 --> 21:42.380
You're madly in love with Evan.

21:46.609 --> 21:47.440
Evan?

21:47.442 --> 21:48.273
Yes.

21:48.275 --> 21:49.219
You're in love with her.

21:50.419 --> 21:53.017
I'm sorry, did someone just
turn on the batshit signal?

21:53.019 --> 21:53.850
It's like I've said.

21:53.852 --> 21:55.777
I've given a lot of thought
to your life situation

21:55.779 --> 21:58.257
and I've had some major insights.

21:58.259 --> 21:59.787
Enlighten me.

21:59.789 --> 22:02.937
You need a girl who's
gonna treat you like a lady.

22:02.939 --> 22:03.947
As apposed to...

22:03.949 --> 22:06.567
As apposed to most
girls who take one look

22:06.569 --> 22:09.907
at your bad girl persona
and immediately turn into

22:09.909 --> 22:12.277
pillow princesses and starfish.

22:12.279 --> 22:13.967
Starfish?

22:13.969 --> 22:16.847
They take their arms and their legs

22:16.849 --> 22:18.549
and they make you do all the work.

22:23.049 --> 22:25.757
You need someone who
will open doors for you.

22:25.759 --> 22:28.987
Put her hand on the small of your back,

22:28.989 --> 22:33.057
grab you by the back of
your head and kiss you.

22:33.059 --> 22:35.487
All the things a girl needs
to make her feel like a woman.

22:35.489 --> 22:39.677
And you know that Evan
can do that for you.

22:39.679 --> 22:41.437
Sounds like you're the
one that's in love with her.

22:41.439 --> 22:43.427
Please, me?

22:43.429 --> 22:47.047
If I wanted Evan, I'd
have had her already.

22:47.049 --> 22:50.287
Look, I get it, Evan is
our fearless leader but

22:50.289 --> 22:52.747
she's also in a serious
longest of terms relationship

22:52.749 --> 22:53.607
with my best friend.

22:53.609 --> 22:55.987
Ryan, there are delusional states

22:55.989 --> 22:57.207
and there's full on psychosis.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.042
Prove it.

22:59.108 --> 23:00.566
Kiss me.

23:00.568 --> 23:02.126
No, I'm not Bridget.

23:02.128 --> 23:03.366
You heard about that?

23:03.368 --> 23:05.236
Kissing lessons out of pity?

23:05.238 --> 23:06.386
It got around.

23:06.388 --> 23:08.066
A concept I'm sure you're familiar with.

23:08.068 --> 23:09.566
Come on.

23:09.568 --> 23:11.926
Everyone wants to kiss me.

23:11.928 --> 23:13.751
Unless they're in love with Evan.

23:16.368 --> 23:18.966
Once again, you've taken this too far.

23:18.968 --> 23:20.546
Let's take it farther.

23:20.548 --> 23:22.336
This is the kind of
initiative you need to show

23:22.338 --> 23:23.688
when you're pursuing women.

23:27.718 --> 23:29.726
Oh my God, if you weren't you,

23:29.728 --> 23:31.646
I'd be totally turned on right now.

23:31.648 --> 23:34.461
Please, cancel my
subscription to your issues.

23:36.058 --> 23:37.558
You're not leaving, are you?

23:39.571 --> 23:42.516
Well, I appreciate your
attempted analysis of my psyche.

23:42.518 --> 23:44.968
Your conclusion couldn't
be further from reality.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.336
I know you're not telling the truth.

23:48.338 --> 23:50.196
You can lie to me and you
can lie to the whole world

23:50.198 --> 23:52.486
but the one person you
can't lie to is yourself.

23:52.488 --> 23:54.946
On the contrary, I
exile in that department.

23:54.948 --> 23:57.241
And, on that note, I bid you adieu.

24:01.538 --> 24:04.841
Apparently Cleopatra wasn't
the only queen of denial.

24:14.528 --> 24:15.391
I miss this.

24:16.468 --> 24:18.576
Yeah, don't get any ideas.

24:18.578 --> 24:19.409
Huh?

24:19.411 --> 24:20.668
This is a one time thing.

24:21.708 --> 24:22.809
A one night stand.

24:22.811 --> 24:25.356
How do you have a one
night stand with your wife?

24:25.358 --> 24:28.446
Until this divorce is final,
we are married in name only.

24:28.448 --> 24:29.553
Wait,

24:29.555 --> 24:31.846
you didn't think we were
getting back together, did you?

24:31.848 --> 24:33.976
Gee, Paige, when you attacked
me when I walked in the door

24:33.978 --> 24:35.786
and we made mad, passionate love.

24:35.788 --> 24:38.806
Yes, I thought maybe our
relationship status was changing.

24:38.808 --> 24:39.916
So immature.

24:39.918 --> 24:41.818
This is exactly why I'm divorcing you.

24:42.893 --> 24:44.016
What the fuck?

24:44.018 --> 24:45.956
Grow up.

24:45.958 --> 24:46.916
You know better.

24:46.918 --> 24:48.746
No, Paige, tell me.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.386
Why am I divorcing you?

24:50.388 --> 24:52.586
Maybe it's because you're
never awake before noon.

24:52.588 --> 24:54.426
Or the constant partying.

24:54.428 --> 24:55.976
Or maybe it's the white stuff

24:55.978 --> 24:57.386
you're constantly shoving up your nose.

24:57.388 --> 24:58.509
I'm a nurse.

24:58.511 --> 25:00.075
I have to stay alert.

25:00.077 --> 25:01.985
I keep kids alive.

25:01.987 --> 25:04.137
Don't hide behind
the pillar of altruism.

25:05.947 --> 25:07.768
You just stand there and criticize me.

25:07.770 --> 25:08.601
Easy for you,

25:08.603 --> 25:10.195
you've never experienced
that kind of pressure.

25:10.197 --> 25:12.065
Yeah, I like nose candy.

25:12.067 --> 25:13.435
I should've been a bigger priority.

25:13.437 --> 25:15.225
Than the kids dying
in the pediatric ward?

25:15.227 --> 25:17.205
Yeah, like when I
asked you to quit blow.

25:17.207 --> 25:19.025
You should have for us.

25:19.027 --> 25:20.295
For you.

25:20.297 --> 25:22.005
Fuck, Paige, you are so selfish.

25:22.007 --> 25:23.435
Why am I still in love with you?

25:23.437 --> 25:26.337
Don't ask me because I'm
certainly not in love with you.

25:29.567 --> 25:31.221
This is heavier than
I thought it would be.

25:32.295 --> 25:33.583
Oh yeah.

25:33.585 --> 25:36.283
They didn't have refined steal yet, duh.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.965
By the late 12th Century,

25:39.967 --> 25:42.655
so the swords in western
Europe had evolved

25:42.657 --> 25:47.515
into cruciform weapons with
circular wheel pommels, usually,

25:47.517 --> 25:49.825
and normally with a fuller or bloodgroove

25:49.827 --> 25:51.027
running down the center.

25:52.357 --> 25:54.469
I feel like Wonder Woman.

25:55.777 --> 25:56.627
Coffee's ready.

25:57.787 --> 25:59.755
Can I set this down?

25:59.757 --> 26:01.435
Only with great caution.

26:01.437 --> 26:02.270
Okay.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.690
Do I act like I'm attracted to Evan?

26:10.567 --> 26:11.695
What? No.

26:11.697 --> 26:13.725
Where'd you even get that idea?

26:13.727 --> 26:16.365
Yeah, Ryan believes I'm
secretly in love with her.

26:16.367 --> 26:17.575
Oh, Ryan.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.265
She certainly has a flair for
the dramatic, doesn't she?

26:20.267 --> 26:22.890
I mean, she should be
writing episodes for Dynasty.

26:25.420 --> 26:28.747
Unless, there's something
you're not telling me.

26:32.357 --> 26:34.755
Ryan, I worry about her.

26:34.757 --> 26:37.785
I mean, the situation with her father.

26:37.787 --> 26:40.705
It's like everyone's
got something to hide,

26:40.707 --> 26:43.585
like we're all keeping a secret

26:43.587 --> 26:46.110
we desperately need to stay concealed.

26:47.057 --> 26:48.950
I wouldn't know anything about that.

26:53.167 --> 26:56.025
How is it that I can
restore ancient weaponry

26:56.027 --> 26:58.704
but I can't make a cup of
coffee without injuring myself?

26:58.706 --> 27:00.834
Because you focus on
the things you love,

27:00.836 --> 27:02.734
like weapons and friends,
with such intensity

27:02.736 --> 27:05.274
that not pouring scolding
hot water on yourself

27:05.276 --> 27:07.304
just simply fades into the background.

27:07.306 --> 27:08.951
Well maybe I'm just clumsy.

27:08.953 --> 27:13.217
Clumsy on you is adorable.

27:13.219 --> 27:16.429
You would be such a good girlfriend.

27:17.476 --> 27:20.164
Why don't you start dating,
put yourself out there?

27:20.166 --> 27:23.294
I don't believe in the
grand idea of romance.

27:23.296 --> 27:25.396
Well, surely you've been in love before.

27:26.616 --> 27:28.684
Do you know how to make
the coffee with the foam or...

27:28.686 --> 27:30.489
Don't evade the topic.

27:32.968 --> 27:33.801
Ugh.

27:34.956 --> 27:37.614
When I was in high school

27:37.616 --> 27:39.304
there was a girl, Whitney Merritt,

27:39.306 --> 27:40.994
she was a senior, I was a sophomore

27:40.996 --> 27:43.474
and she would drive me
home everyday from school

27:43.476 --> 27:46.026
in a red Mustang, so I
didn't have to take the bus.

27:47.396 --> 27:49.774
She was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen

27:49.776 --> 27:52.394
and I convinced myself that we
were destined to be together

27:52.396 --> 27:55.339
and at the end of the school
year, I professed my love.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.634
And?

27:58.636 --> 28:00.462
Well, I never heard from her again.

28:00.464 --> 28:02.634
She went to the Hamptons for the summer

28:02.636 --> 28:04.986
and then straight to a
private woman's college.

28:05.826 --> 28:06.854
I'm still looking for her.

28:06.856 --> 28:09.999
But not her, specifically,
because that would be creepy.

28:11.036 --> 28:13.134
But I'm looking to feel
that way, I felt about her,

28:13.136 --> 28:14.259
with someone else.

28:15.373 --> 28:18.484
In that sense, I guess, I'll
always be chasing Whitney.

28:18.486 --> 28:19.319
So,

28:20.616 --> 28:23.004
this is there you got all the angst

28:23.006 --> 28:24.899
that inspired you to become a writer.

28:25.743 --> 28:26.949
I'm afraid it did.

28:28.676 --> 28:31.264
Yeah, my mom could tell I was
really emotionally devastated

28:31.266 --> 28:33.644
and we didn't have much

28:33.646 --> 28:35.664
but she bought me this
used lime green iBook

28:35.666 --> 28:38.374
into which I just poured by soul.

28:38.376 --> 28:40.514
And through which you began your journey

28:40.516 --> 28:43.084
to becoming one of the
great novelists of our time.

28:43.086 --> 28:44.975
More like my journey to
writing engagement announcements

28:44.977 --> 28:46.519
and other forms of drivel.

28:48.066 --> 28:48.899
What I need

28:50.146 --> 28:51.129
is inspiration.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.099
I'm currently stuck in writers' gridlock.

28:55.046 --> 28:56.824
Maybe

28:56.826 --> 28:59.735
what you need is to, you know.

29:02.185 --> 29:03.128
Get laid?

29:04.112 --> 29:06.998
Yeah, that seems to be the consensus.

29:10.175 --> 29:11.008
Hello, ladies.

29:11.991 --> 29:13.058
Aww.

29:16.795 --> 29:18.373
Hello, dear.

29:18.375 --> 29:20.075
Productive day in zee noo Germany?

29:24.499 --> 29:25.330
What is it?

29:25.332 --> 29:26.295
Something medieval.

29:33.525 --> 29:35.753
Time for Middle East peace conference.

29:35.755 --> 29:36.598
Oh, okay.

29:39.842 --> 29:41.603
I have to marry Bridget, now.

29:41.605 --> 29:42.723
Why?

29:42.725 --> 29:44.075
Did you get her knocked up?

29:45.125 --> 29:46.133
Kidding.

29:46.135 --> 29:47.443
What's the rush?

29:47.445 --> 29:48.993
Dov, when you meet
the girl of your dreams

29:48.995 --> 29:50.193
and you look into her eyes,

29:50.195 --> 29:51.853
you'll understand that
the most important thing

29:51.855 --> 29:53.498
is never letting her go.

29:55.249 --> 29:57.998
I wouldn't know anything
about that either.

29:59.445 --> 30:01.301
I'm gonna kill myself.

30:01.303 --> 30:02.553
It's only coffee, Evan.

30:05.305 --> 30:07.443
Oops, you did it again.

30:07.445 --> 30:08.276
Who is she?

30:08.278 --> 30:11.223
An intern at my father's
campaign headquarters.

30:11.225 --> 30:13.003
I hate cliches.

30:13.005 --> 30:13.903
How old?

30:13.905 --> 30:15.113
She's in college.

30:15.115 --> 30:15.946
Not what I asked.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.411
19.

30:17.413 --> 30:18.320
Whoa, you like to play low numbers.

30:18.322 --> 30:19.973
I like to win.

30:19.975 --> 30:21.089
It's not a casino.

30:21.091 --> 30:23.533
It's a game, it's all a game.

30:23.535 --> 30:26.943
I'm just thinking that if
you can't stop screwing around,

30:26.945 --> 30:29.773
you should probably let Bridget
go and find someone else.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.657
I just need her to marry me.

30:36.659 --> 30:38.783
Do you really feel that marriage

30:38.785 --> 30:40.608
is gonna make you stop
cheating on Bridget?

30:40.610 --> 30:41.763
Yes.

30:41.765 --> 30:43.460
Hey, this girl, she didn't touch me.

30:43.462 --> 30:45.372
It' a one way street, you understand?

30:45.374 --> 30:47.023
Well you're driving down
it in the wrong direction.

30:47.025 --> 30:49.568
What's your philosophy,
Evan, eating isn't cheating?

30:56.791 --> 31:00.123
It's entirely historically inaccurate.

31:01.244 --> 31:02.369
And I love it.

31:04.351 --> 31:05.184
My baby.

31:07.518 --> 31:12.518
I guess I'll wear it all the time.

31:46.981 --> 31:47.812
Hey.

31:47.814 --> 31:49.772
Hey, did Dov leave?

31:49.774 --> 31:51.912
No, she left right after we ate.

31:51.914 --> 31:53.292
I didn't notice.

31:53.294 --> 31:54.127
Thank you.

31:58.511 --> 32:00.867
"Your eyes are blue torch light.

32:02.041 --> 32:03.827
"Ice-kissed frost fire.

32:04.951 --> 32:06.902
"My wasted heart melts there."

32:06.904 --> 32:08.262
You know, it's cute,

32:08.264 --> 32:11.389
like a middle school
love note or something.

32:11.391 --> 32:13.642
"Ice-kissed frost fire?"

32:13.644 --> 32:15.101
You wrote this for me?

32:15.103 --> 32:17.629
No, you wrote it for me.

32:17.631 --> 32:19.736
Oh shit, or didn't you?

32:19.738 --> 32:21.722
Evan, that's not even my handwriting.

32:21.724 --> 32:23.387
You're saying you didn't write that.

32:25.584 --> 32:27.172
Where did you find that?

32:27.174 --> 32:29.692
Just in the kitchen, just over there.

32:29.694 --> 32:31.792
Somebody wrote it.

32:31.794 --> 32:34.157
Looks like you have a secret admirer.

32:35.284 --> 32:39.123
They're out of luck because
I have eyes only for you.

33:29.197 --> 33:32.541
No, no, no.

33:35.473 --> 33:36.851
But.

33:36.853 --> 33:39.131
The answering machine is full.

33:42.673 --> 33:44.111
Hello.

33:44.113 --> 33:45.891
Hey, Bridget.

33:45.893 --> 33:46.796
Is Evan there?

33:49.823 --> 33:50.983
Evan Dever.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.491
Evan.

33:52.493 --> 33:53.901
It's Ryan.

33:53.903 --> 33:55.311
I'm locked out of my house.

33:55.313 --> 33:57.511
What time is it?

33:57.513 --> 33:58.811
Please.

33:58.813 --> 34:01.461
I was out partying with
these Iranian guys.

34:01.463 --> 34:02.551
No offense.

34:02.553 --> 34:03.541
None taken.

34:03.543 --> 34:05.171
And we were doing blow all night

34:05.173 --> 34:08.951
and I got that feeling, you know?

34:08.953 --> 34:10.791
The one that says "leave now."

34:10.793 --> 34:13.460
So I got out of there but
my keys aren't in my clutch

34:13.462 --> 34:15.899
and I don't wanna go back alone.

34:15.900 --> 34:18.630
I thought maybe since you're Arab...

34:19.592 --> 34:21.751
Iranians are Persian, not Arab.

34:21.753 --> 34:23.166
Oh.

34:23.168 --> 34:25.596
Oh, right.

34:26.563 --> 34:27.616
Don't worry about it.

34:29.163 --> 34:32.041
I think you can reason
with them since you're,

34:32.043 --> 34:32.886
you know,

34:34.303 --> 34:35.436
Middle Eastern.

34:36.623 --> 34:38.331
Please come get me.

34:38.333 --> 34:39.701
I'm on my way.

34:39.703 --> 34:41.226
Do you speak Arabic?

34:41.228 --> 34:42.414
No.

34:48.402 --> 34:49.235
Hello?

35:13.462 --> 35:15.710
You were so good at reasoning with them.

35:15.712 --> 35:17.635
Evan Dever, you're my hero.

35:23.842 --> 35:24.940
Do you wanna come inside?

35:24.942 --> 35:26.437
Stay up and party all
night like the old days?

35:26.439 --> 35:28.755
I have to be at work in three hours.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.460
How'd you afford this?

35:31.462 --> 35:32.635
My daddy hates me.

35:39.432 --> 35:40.988
Hey.

35:40.990 --> 35:41.971
Hey.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.295
I live next door, I'm Misha.

35:44.297 --> 35:45.450
Evan.

35:45.452 --> 35:47.780
Are you Ryan's new girl?

35:47.782 --> 35:49.730
Oh no, we're good friends.

35:49.732 --> 35:51.320
That's what they all say.

35:51.322 --> 35:54.095
Can you light me one of those, cowboy?

35:56.352 --> 35:58.345
How about I give you this one, cowgirl?

36:03.912 --> 36:05.010
Thanks.

36:05.012 --> 36:06.112
Think nothing of it.

36:07.002 --> 36:08.864
You're up late.

36:08.866 --> 36:10.949
Oh yeah, we were just...

36:11.822 --> 36:14.711
Wanna come over to my place, hang out?

36:14.713 --> 36:16.450
I have to be up early.

36:16.452 --> 36:18.795
Okay, well, you know where to find me.

36:21.379 --> 36:22.412
Hey!

36:22.414 --> 36:23.247
Come on!

36:40.352 --> 36:41.570
You know, cocaine is
God's way of telling you

36:41.572 --> 36:43.150
you have too much money.

36:43.152 --> 36:45.102
I don't need God to tell me I'm rich.

36:46.467 --> 36:47.717
You need to be careful.

36:48.552 --> 36:49.460
I've seen a lot of pretty girls

36:49.462 --> 36:51.380
ruin their looks with this stuff.

36:51.382 --> 36:54.664
Well it's a lucky thing I
don't plan on living past 30.

36:54.666 --> 36:55.497
You have some on your nose.

36:55.499 --> 36:57.295
It's okay, I'm gonna keep doing it.

37:00.381 --> 37:02.929
God blessed me with
good looks and cursed me

37:02.931 --> 37:05.199
with the knowledge that
they would one day fade.

37:05.201 --> 37:06.994
There's no reason to rush prophecy.

37:08.541 --> 37:10.119
How come you and I never got together?

37:10.121 --> 37:11.789
We've been over this.

37:11.791 --> 37:13.069
Come on.

37:13.071 --> 37:14.344
We'd be so cute.

37:15.751 --> 37:17.564
Because a player can't get played.

37:24.431 --> 37:26.839
Which one of us is the
play in this scenario?

37:26.841 --> 37:27.724
We both are.

37:30.871 --> 37:32.459
Additionally, I happen to be madly in love

37:32.461 --> 37:35.579
with you best friend, whom
I also plan on marrying.

37:35.581 --> 37:38.129
What's with you saying
"whom" all the time?

37:38.131 --> 37:40.092
I went to the same school
as you and I can't do that.

37:40.094 --> 37:41.382
I was paying attention in class.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.249
I doubt you even showed up.

37:43.251 --> 37:44.319
I finished four years in three

37:44.321 --> 37:46.649
and never even cracked the text book.

37:46.651 --> 37:47.514
Show-off.

37:49.841 --> 37:50.674
I'm cold.

37:51.701 --> 37:52.544
Get on the bed.

38:01.358 --> 38:03.275
I don't know, it's just

38:04.671 --> 38:08.109
nice having someone like me for me.

38:08.111 --> 38:09.511
Bridget likes you for you.

38:10.741 --> 38:11.691
That's different.

38:13.261 --> 38:14.304
She's not a boy.

38:15.521 --> 38:16.524
You're a boy, Evan.

38:17.381 --> 38:19.059
That's why I called you.

38:19.061 --> 38:20.761
I wanted a boy to take care of me.

38:26.890 --> 38:29.640
We have the best group, don't we?

38:30.517 --> 38:34.038
You're the king, Bridget's the queen.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.869
I'm definitely the princess.

38:37.871 --> 38:39.171
What are Dov and Trista?

38:41.351 --> 38:42.351
The court jesters.

38:47.311 --> 38:48.231
Hey, Evan?

38:48.233 --> 38:49.066
Mhmm?

38:50.051 --> 38:50.999
There's something I need to tell you.

38:51.001 --> 38:53.034
You can tell me anything.

38:54.424 --> 38:55.674
You're right.

38:56.594 --> 38:57.913
I can always count on you.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.898
Hey,

39:08.900 --> 39:09.793
can you stay?

39:11.590 --> 39:13.178
At least until I'm asleep?

39:13.180 --> 39:14.730
That won't be for a few days.

39:16.040 --> 39:16.873
Fair point.

39:18.680 --> 39:21.230
Do you think you could at
least sleep here tonight?

39:22.461 --> 39:24.068
I'd feel a lot safer.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.638
You're paranoid from all the coke.

39:26.640 --> 39:27.571
Do you think Bridget will mind?

39:27.573 --> 39:29.978
Because I could call her
right now and tell her.

39:29.980 --> 39:31.798
Bridget forced you to
give her kissing lessons.

39:31.800 --> 39:32.663
She'll be fine.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.133
Hey, Evan?

39:40.991 --> 39:41.824
Mhmm?

39:43.730 --> 39:44.995
I love you.

39:44.997 --> 39:46.633
You too, sweetheart.

39:48.705 --> 39:50.727
And not in a gay way.

40:19.480 --> 40:20.679
No.

40:20.681 --> 40:22.326
No, no.

40:22.328 --> 40:23.655
No, no.

40:41.920 --> 40:43.298
Dov isn't here right now,

40:43.300 --> 40:44.918
would you like to leave a message?

40:44.920 --> 40:45.898
Where the fuck are you?

40:45.900 --> 40:48.618
You know how much this
party means to Bridget.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.928
What time is it?

40:49.930 --> 40:51.418
Were you asleep?

40:51.420 --> 40:52.720
Were you dreaming of Evan?

40:53.640 --> 40:55.028
I hate myself.

40:55.030 --> 40:57.787
You love someone who doesn't love you.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.137
And I thought writers didn't like cliches.

41:00.139 --> 41:02.567
It's not so cliche that I hate myself.

41:02.569 --> 41:03.927
Hang on.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.207
Dov, you know how much
this party means to Bridget.

41:06.209 --> 41:07.609
That's what I said.

41:08.449 --> 41:09.417
I'm dying.

41:09.419 --> 41:10.284
You're not dying.

41:10.286 --> 41:11.717
You just can't think of
anything better to do.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.877
Tell her to take some Gas-X.

41:13.879 --> 41:16.062
Get dressed and get the fuck over here.

41:18.429 --> 41:19.652
The king has spoken.

41:31.752 --> 41:36.752
Hello?

41:50.257 --> 41:51.326
Oh!

41:51.328 --> 41:52.159
You look amazing!

41:52.161 --> 41:54.260
This is hilarious!

41:58.080 --> 41:59.611
Where's your costume?

41:59.613 --> 42:01.034
This is not good enough.

42:01.036 --> 42:01.953
Whatever.

42:03.181 --> 42:04.012
Oh, Ryan.

42:04.014 --> 42:06.168
You need to wear your glasses.

42:06.170 --> 42:08.337
Oh, they make me look like a nerd

42:08.339 --> 42:10.899
and they're historically inaccurate.

42:12.589 --> 42:13.827
Dov is coming.

42:13.829 --> 42:14.767
Oh, thanks for calling her.

42:14.769 --> 42:16.797
I didn't realize she wasn't here.

42:16.799 --> 42:17.847
So, apparently my dad

42:17.849 --> 42:20.357
is in some kind of induced-coma state.

42:20.359 --> 42:22.117
I don't get it, I thought
in Europe they had laws

42:22.119 --> 42:24.287
where they let people die.

42:24.289 --> 42:25.887
He wants that?

42:25.889 --> 42:27.307
Euthanasia?

42:27.309 --> 42:28.757
Youth in Asia?

42:28.759 --> 42:30.332
What do they have to do with it?

42:50.518 --> 42:51.351
Hi.

42:57.899 --> 42:58.732
Dov.

43:02.871 --> 43:04.956
Time for a Mid-East summit?

43:04.958 --> 43:06.946
I need to unburden my conscience.

43:06.948 --> 43:08.148
Do you take confessions?

43:09.028 --> 43:10.936
Do I look like a priest?

43:10.938 --> 43:12.665
You look poor and celibate.

43:14.488 --> 43:16.076
Close enough, what's up?

43:16.078 --> 43:19.156
My intern, now she says
she's in love with me.

43:19.158 --> 43:21.261
I have to see her every day.

43:22.768 --> 43:23.736
I don't know how to handle it.

43:23.738 --> 43:26.056
Why don't you be a big boy
and stop committing adultery

43:26.058 --> 43:28.226
with your teenage subordinate?

43:28.228 --> 43:30.396
It's not adultery unless you're married.

43:30.398 --> 43:31.966
Until Bridget accepts my offer,

43:31.968 --> 43:34.021
I have no reason to decline any others.

43:35.318 --> 43:36.466
I'll tell you what.

43:36.468 --> 43:38.736
Say three Hail Mary's, four Our Father's

43:38.738 --> 43:39.569
and pray that there's a God

43:39.571 --> 43:42.021
that will absolve you of your sins.

43:42.023 --> 43:43.896
You know what I like about you?

43:43.898 --> 43:44.766
Can't wait.

43:44.768 --> 43:46.416
You always tell it like it is.

43:46.418 --> 43:48.116
You never lie.

43:48.118 --> 43:49.276
You're a straight shooter.

43:49.278 --> 43:51.585
Not so sure about the
"straight" part but.

44:46.248 --> 44:47.596
Hey, over here!

44:47.598 --> 44:49.216
I want you to meet my neighbor's daughter.

44:49.218 --> 44:50.396
She's Jewish too.

44:50.398 --> 44:51.386
Misha!

44:51.388 --> 44:52.926
Misha!

44:52.928 --> 44:54.666
Misha,

44:54.668 --> 44:57.450
this is Dov, I was telling you about her.

44:58.327 --> 44:59.970
I like your haircut.

45:01.737 --> 45:02.568
Thanks.

45:02.570 --> 45:03.725
No one ever says that.

45:03.727 --> 45:04.565
Really?

45:04.567 --> 45:06.420
That's the first thing I noticed.

45:11.427 --> 45:12.330
Spectacular.

45:15.257 --> 45:17.120
I like your bonnet.

45:18.946 --> 45:19.779
Ummm.

45:22.447 --> 45:23.682
Truth.

45:23.684 --> 45:24.517
Hmmmmm.

45:25.737 --> 45:26.837
What are your numbers?

45:28.267 --> 45:29.865
Well,

45:29.867 --> 45:31.725
I knew I was a lesbian in high school

45:31.727 --> 45:33.415
but I didn't come out until college,

45:33.417 --> 45:35.320
which is where I met Evan.

45:36.390 --> 45:39.245
But then I Puerto Rico to live
with my dad for a few years

45:39.247 --> 45:40.895
and they're really conservative there,

45:40.897 --> 45:42.820
but I kept in touch with Evan,

45:45.329 --> 45:48.625
so eventually she offered
to pay for grad school

45:48.627 --> 45:49.560
if I came back.

45:51.689 --> 45:53.720
So, what's your answer?

45:55.627 --> 45:57.105
Just Evan.

45:57.107 --> 45:58.149
Just one.

45:58.151 --> 45:59.135
Uh-uh.

45:59.137 --> 46:00.065
No, you're lying.

46:00.067 --> 46:01.325
She's not.

46:01.327 --> 46:03.331
She would've told me.

46:03.333 --> 46:05.035
Do you think about other women?

46:05.037 --> 46:07.165
Well, I mean yeah, I
think about other women

46:07.167 --> 46:08.140
but I love Evan.

46:09.207 --> 46:10.884
Wow, that's super deep.

46:13.277 --> 46:14.677
Okay, so...

46:16.837 --> 46:17.670
Who's next?

46:19.667 --> 46:20.805
Ryan.

46:20.807 --> 46:21.665
Yes?

46:21.667 --> 46:22.500
Dare.

46:25.827 --> 46:27.165
Kiss Evan.

46:27.167 --> 46:28.000
Fuck yeah.

46:40.957 --> 46:41.860
My turn.

46:45.267 --> 46:46.970
Dov, truth or dare?

46:48.557 --> 46:49.388
Truth.

46:49.390 --> 46:50.520
You sure about that?

46:52.787 --> 46:53.620
No.

46:54.547 --> 46:55.380
Dare.

46:56.647 --> 46:57.519
I choose dare.

47:06.606 --> 47:08.013
Kiss Evan.

47:10.263 --> 47:11.094
No.

47:11.096 --> 47:11.927
Kiss Evan.

47:11.929 --> 47:12.760
Nope.

47:12.762 --> 47:13.644
That's your
dare, you have to do it.

47:13.646 --> 47:14.554
I'm not.

47:14.556 --> 47:15.387
Why?

47:15.389 --> 47:17.594
Is there something wrong with Evan?

47:17.596 --> 47:18.884
I just don't want to.

47:18.886 --> 47:19.724
Give me another dare.

47:19.726 --> 47:20.924
That's not how it works.

47:20.926 --> 47:22.454
Do you think I wanted to kiss Evan?

47:22.456 --> 47:23.634
Yeah, I think you did.

47:23.636 --> 47:25.064
Poor example.

47:25.066 --> 47:27.254
Oh, come on, you're
gonna make her feel bad.

47:27.256 --> 47:29.454
Stop, she doesn't have to kiss me.

47:29.456 --> 47:30.944
Yes she does.

47:30.946 --> 47:33.264
If I'd welched on every
dare I got in high school,

47:33.266 --> 47:34.947
I wouldn't be the woman I am today.

47:35.782 --> 47:37.989
I think you're arguing
against your own point.

47:43.161 --> 47:43.994
Awwww.

47:46.354 --> 47:48.166
Good job, Evan.

47:48.168 --> 47:49.719
Was that so bad?

47:50.658 --> 47:52.158
Oooooh.

48:02.693 --> 48:03.526
There.

48:04.796 --> 48:06.919
Bridget, Evan, thank you for having me.

48:06.921 --> 48:07.944
Come on!

48:07.946 --> 48:09.009
You're not leaving!

48:10.113 --> 48:11.363
Come back!

48:11.365 --> 48:12.895
Come back!

48:12.897 --> 48:14.300
Awww.

48:14.302 --> 48:15.705
Bye, Felicia.

48:19.786 --> 48:21.171
Well, that was a play full of awkwardness.

48:21.173 --> 48:22.584
It was like being kissed

48:22.586 --> 48:24.619
by a 12 year old virgin of myself.

48:25.806 --> 48:27.404
Gotta disinfect.

48:27.406 --> 48:29.347
Drink it, drink all of it.

48:29.349 --> 48:31.173
Kill the bottle, kill it.

48:32.556 --> 48:34.443
Here, here, I got you.

48:35.607 --> 48:36.907
I'm just gonna lick it up.

48:42.166 --> 48:43.429
Hey, wait up!

48:44.406 --> 48:45.701
What were you thinking?

48:45.703 --> 48:47.159
I did you a favor.

48:48.327 --> 48:49.158
You humiliated me.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.859
I'm not in love with Evan!

48:51.906 --> 48:52.794
What's it gonna take to get that through

48:52.796 --> 48:54.194
your pretty, little skull?!

48:54.196 --> 48:56.504
Denial ain't just a river in Egypt.

48:56.506 --> 48:58.433
Maybe one kiss from your
lips is all it would take

48:58.435 --> 49:01.373
and Evan would decide to
leave Bridget forever.

49:01.375 --> 49:02.653
If only.

49:02.655 --> 49:03.973
Aren't you the one who's
supposed to be looking out

49:03.975 --> 49:05.373
for her best interests?

49:05.375 --> 49:06.925
What makes you think I'm not?

49:08.275 --> 49:10.113
Where'd that come from?

49:10.115 --> 49:12.313
I had lunch at Evan's office last week.

49:12.315 --> 49:14.263
I got a look at Evan's intern.

49:14.265 --> 49:16.303
More specifically, I got a look at the way

49:16.305 --> 49:18.193
Evan looks at her intern.

49:18.195 --> 49:20.323
I don't know if she's done anything or not

49:20.325 --> 49:23.053
but I know Evan and I know people

49:23.055 --> 49:24.463
and I know that the one thing

49:24.465 --> 49:26.508
that people never, ever do is change.

49:29.295 --> 49:31.343
Listen, this had been a
little too much reality

49:31.345 --> 49:32.283
for one night.

49:32.285 --> 49:35.203
I like substances and I like abusing them.

49:35.205 --> 49:36.168
I don't know, Ry.

49:37.155 --> 49:41.043
Some dweezoid left a mondo
of Purple Urkel at my place.

49:41.045 --> 49:42.473
It's yours for the taking.

49:42.475 --> 49:44.273
As am I.

49:44.275 --> 49:45.288
Purple Urkel?

49:46.185 --> 49:48.933
I cordially invite you
to night of bad decisions

49:48.935 --> 49:51.196
and debauchery at my apartment.

49:54.995 --> 49:57.233
Then I cordially
accept but I'm still mad.

49:57.235 --> 49:59.003
I can live with that.

49:59.005 --> 50:00.443
Are you gonna try to seduce me again?

50:00.445 --> 50:02.913
Depends, do you want me to?

50:02.915 --> 50:03.778
Yeah

50:22.215 --> 50:23.893
Hey, Jew bu.

50:23.895 --> 50:26.053
This isn't Buddha, this is Shiva.

50:26.055 --> 50:28.003
I thought you were in
an exclusive relationship

50:28.005 --> 50:29.205
with the God of Abraham.

50:30.295 --> 50:32.423
I took an Asian
Philosophy class in college.

50:32.425 --> 50:34.673
I didn't understand a word of it but

50:34.675 --> 50:36.223
it was graded on a curve so,

50:36.225 --> 50:37.625
I passed with flying colors.

50:38.615 --> 50:43.615
And what brought on this
bout of religious bi curiosity?

50:43.625 --> 50:45.823
Trying, again, to write my novel

50:45.825 --> 50:48.325
and failing, again, to
come up with a single word.

50:49.735 --> 50:51.943
And how's this ritual helping you?

50:51.945 --> 50:54.808
Clearly, you understand nothing
about the writing process.

50:57.764 --> 50:58.977
I saw Paige yesterday.

51:00.034 --> 51:00.887
How'd it go?

51:01.907 --> 51:03.057
I didn't talk to her.

51:04.276 --> 51:05.982
You can't keep standing
outside your old house

51:05.984 --> 51:07.422
and spying on her.

51:07.424 --> 51:08.472
Why not?

51:08.474 --> 51:09.674
What are yo afraid of?

51:10.864 --> 51:11.697
Dying alone.

51:13.003 --> 51:14.497
I think we're in the same boat.

51:15.519 --> 51:17.719
More like a sinking ship.

51:17.721 --> 51:19.445
Except, I've long accepted the fact

51:19.447 --> 51:20.882
that the woman who owns my heart

51:20.884 --> 51:23.132
will never return my feelings.

51:23.134 --> 51:24.884
Which bitch are you in love with?

51:25.824 --> 51:27.312
That's between me and my God.

51:27.314 --> 51:29.847
Which God, I haven't decided yet.

51:31.284 --> 51:33.202
If you're obsessed with
some unobtainable girl,

51:33.204 --> 51:35.232
you have to profess to her your love.

51:35.234 --> 51:36.982
I'd rather keep writing
engagement announcements

51:36.984 --> 51:38.992
for the rest of my natural born life.

51:38.994 --> 51:40.347
So much irony in that.

51:41.564 --> 51:43.762
You could offer me a million
dollars to write a book,

51:43.764 --> 51:44.595
right now,

51:44.597 --> 51:47.292
I wouldn't be able to come
up with a single thing.

51:47.294 --> 51:49.302
I know what you need
to write a book about.

51:49.304 --> 51:51.272
Write a book about a group of lesbians

51:51.274 --> 51:52.832
who are constantly creating

51:52.834 --> 51:54.722
unnecessary and neuritic problems

51:54.724 --> 51:58.452
to keep them from dealing with
their terrifying problems,

51:58.454 --> 52:00.012
like reality.

52:00.014 --> 52:01.162
Come on.

52:01.164 --> 52:02.417
No one would read that.

52:08.924 --> 52:10.862
I'm getting a promotion at the museum.

52:10.864 --> 52:12.795
That's so great.

52:12.797 --> 52:16.522
And I might even be getting
a fellowship in Romania.

52:16.524 --> 52:19.197
Are you still gonna have a
big, gay Republican wedding?

52:20.529 --> 52:22.122
I don't even wanna think about it.

52:22.124 --> 52:24.042
Can I be a bridesmaid?

52:24.044 --> 52:26.892
No one's ever asked me to be a bridesmaid.

52:26.894 --> 52:28.104
I'm just so

52:29.774 --> 52:30.912
unsure.

52:30.914 --> 52:33.747
But you and Evan have
a fairytale romance.

52:34.940 --> 52:36.737
I love Evan, I do.

52:38.961 --> 52:41.181
"Ice-kissed frost fire."

52:42.314 --> 52:43.147
What?

52:44.914 --> 52:45.747
Nothing.

52:49.834 --> 52:51.482
Okay.

52:51.484 --> 52:55.729
Someone wrote Evan an anonymous love note.

52:55.731 --> 52:57.171
Oh my God.

52:57.173 --> 52:58.476
That's so pathetic.

52:59.603 --> 53:02.254
You don't know anything
about it, do you?

53:06.953 --> 53:08.311
So good.

53:08.313 --> 53:09.901
Where'd you learn to
make coffee like this?

53:09.903 --> 53:11.561
Late nights in stuffy museums,

53:11.563 --> 53:13.611
a person will resort
to desperate measures.

53:13.613 --> 53:15.866
Desperate measures is
my area of expertise.

53:17.453 --> 53:18.853
Hey, Ryan, how's your dad?

53:20.143 --> 53:21.943
Still hanging on, the old bastard.

53:23.543 --> 53:25.818
I'm worried about you.

53:25.820 --> 53:29.831
You don't seem bothered that
your dad is going to die.

53:29.833 --> 53:31.631
I'm very bothered.

53:31.633 --> 53:33.351
Once I collect inheritance,
it's gonna put me

53:33.353 --> 53:35.737
in an entirely new tax bracket.

53:35.739 --> 53:36.570
That's the other thing.

53:36.572 --> 53:38.886
You seem obsessed with getting his money.

53:40.243 --> 53:41.906
Once I become rich,

53:43.023 --> 53:44.256
I mean, rich rich,

53:45.583 --> 53:47.933
I'll never have to work
another day of my life.

53:49.463 --> 53:51.713
I'll just be tattooing
for shits and giggles.

53:54.653 --> 53:57.901
Evan's paying your tuition
for grad school, right?

53:57.903 --> 54:00.002
Yeah, but it's just temporary.

54:00.004 --> 54:02.581
When I get my career going,
I'm gonna pay her back.

54:02.583 --> 54:05.983
And you're not paying
rent to live with her?

54:06.853 --> 54:07.684
I try.

54:07.686 --> 54:11.391
I insisted, actually, but
she wouldn't hear of it.

54:11.393 --> 54:13.481
She refused to take anything from me

54:13.483 --> 54:16.036
because we're in love.

54:19.313 --> 54:20.146
What a world.

54:21.163 --> 54:21.994
Yeah.

54:21.996 --> 54:24.541
The world is crazy, right?

54:24.543 --> 54:25.376
No.

54:27.053 --> 54:28.000
I meant, yours.

54:49.804 --> 54:51.401
I'm thinking June 1st.

54:51.403 --> 54:53.261
That'll give you enough time to prepare.

54:53.263 --> 54:55.751
You'll have a wedding planner
to assist you, of course.

54:55.753 --> 54:58.452
I just got a promotion, I
barely have time as it is.

54:59.302 --> 55:01.120
I'm thinking a garden wedding.

55:01.122 --> 55:02.080
I can see it now.

55:02.082 --> 55:03.290
Our lesbian nuptials will be

55:03.292 --> 55:05.590
the Republican social
gathering of the year.

55:05.592 --> 55:07.290
Do you want a wedding ceremony

55:07.292 --> 55:10.495
or a political gathering
worthy of CNN coverage?

55:10.497 --> 55:11.620
I can see it now.

55:11.622 --> 55:13.780
The Republicans can sit
on my side of the isle

55:13.782 --> 55:16.549
and since your family isn't coming, sorry,

55:16.551 --> 55:19.095
anyone who are Democrats
appear can sit on yours.

55:22.582 --> 55:23.415
Ugh.

55:24.512 --> 55:27.490
I've been, okay, do you
mind if I say something?

55:27.492 --> 55:28.750
Offensive?

55:28.752 --> 55:29.989
Just when I thought this conversation

55:29.991 --> 55:32.090
couldn't get any more interesting.

55:32.092 --> 55:33.720
Okay.

55:33.722 --> 55:34.555
Okay.

55:36.162 --> 55:39.600
Look, I've never seen
a white Arab than you.

55:39.602 --> 55:41.820
I've never seen a whiter person than you.

55:41.822 --> 55:44.560
I mean, it's all too easy
with your golden locks

55:44.562 --> 55:48.145
and your fair skin to
avoid discrimination.

55:49.512 --> 55:50.362
What about you?

55:51.477 --> 55:53.540
You think in a million years
anyone would think you were gay

55:53.542 --> 55:55.090
from looking at you?

55:55.092 --> 55:57.150
Because that's what I have to live with.

55:57.152 --> 56:00.630
Every person who sees me sees a dyke.

56:00.632 --> 56:02.000
It's not a competition.

56:02.002 --> 56:03.370
My point is that this is a case

56:03.372 --> 56:05.172
of the pot calling the kettle white.

56:06.162 --> 56:08.040
As sure is the day is long,

56:08.042 --> 56:10.070
they will fuck you.

56:10.072 --> 56:12.290
They will fuck you and me

56:12.292 --> 56:16.470
and every gay and lesbian
and brown and black person.

56:16.472 --> 56:19.180
You are delusional if you think

56:19.182 --> 56:21.000
you're gonna come out ahead on this.

56:21.002 --> 56:22.702
Now tell me how you really feel.

56:24.324 --> 56:25.157
Come on.

56:27.832 --> 56:30.970
Bridget, this is just background noise.

56:30.972 --> 56:31.803
Let's get married and start

56:31.805 --> 56:33.615
an exciting new chapter in our lives.

56:34.802 --> 56:37.780
Do you know many happily
married people, Evan?

56:37.782 --> 56:38.715
Because I don't.

56:42.742 --> 56:44.378
This house is falling apart.

56:44.380 --> 56:46.400
You know, I think you
wanted to redo the house

56:46.402 --> 56:47.686
so you threw that Halloween party

56:47.688 --> 56:49.588
knowing how much damage it would make.

56:53.026 --> 56:55.144
We need to redo the carpets.

56:55.146 --> 56:56.989
The walls need new paint.

56:56.991 --> 56:59.374
I need to get an
estimate on the foundation.

57:01.151 --> 57:01.984
Yeah.

57:03.091 --> 57:04.641
Let's fix the foundation first.

58:06.719 --> 58:08.679
Ryan, your hands are shaking.

58:08.681 --> 58:09.739
It's freezing in here.

58:09.741 --> 58:11.029
Would it kill you to
pay your heating bill?

58:11.031 --> 58:12.099
Just.

58:12.101 --> 58:13.729
No, don't stab out my eye.

58:13.731 --> 58:15.729
My insurance plan sucks!

58:15.731 --> 58:16.564
Damn!

58:19.071 --> 58:20.221
How's your dad?

58:21.270 --> 58:23.689
Ugh, he won't die.

58:23.691 --> 58:26.999
Did I tell you why I
became a tattoo artist?

58:27.001 --> 58:28.469
It was to punish him.

58:28.471 --> 58:31.199
I got this fancy degree in art history

58:31.201 --> 58:33.079
that cost him a fortune and now I use it

58:33.081 --> 58:34.759
to give people something they're regret

58:34.761 --> 58:36.049
for the rest of their lives.

58:36.051 --> 58:37.351
Like he regrets having me.

58:39.501 --> 58:42.509
Bridget, you are so beautiful.

58:42.511 --> 58:44.139
If I were you, I wouldn't
give a second thought

58:44.141 --> 58:46.089
to the intern at Evan's office.

58:46.091 --> 58:47.854
You're much prettier than she is.

58:48.901 --> 58:50.184
Oh, excuse me.

58:52.311 --> 58:55.671
It's like a "don't do drugs, kids" PSA.

59:17.630 --> 59:19.237
Attention!

59:19.239 --> 59:20.527
Attention!

59:20.529 --> 59:22.196
Ladies and gentlemen

59:23.057 --> 59:25.073
and everyone else.

59:25.075 --> 59:27.628
I have an announcement!

59:27.630 --> 59:28.758
Bridget!

59:28.760 --> 59:29.658
Bridget!

59:29.660 --> 59:30.803
Where are you, baby?

59:33.180 --> 59:35.478
I know most girls,

59:35.480 --> 59:38.748
I know most girls lose their
virginity on prom night

59:38.750 --> 59:42.018
but tonight, I'm hoping that my true love

59:42.020 --> 59:44.658
will make an honest fella out of me.

59:44.660 --> 59:46.278
She's wasted.

59:46.280 --> 59:49.603
This has been burning a
whole in my pocket for weeks.

59:50.710 --> 59:55.130
Bridget, will you do me
the extraordinary honor

59:56.090 --> 59:57.653
of becoming my bride?

59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.013
Evan, you're drunk.

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.920
Sapphire to match your eyes.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.243
There's something we
need to talk about first.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.478
What are we gonna do about

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.230
all your late nights at the office?

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.283
What do you mean?

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.938
I'm talking about all
the special attention

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.490
you've been giving your intern.

01:00:34.565 --> 01:00:35.648
You told her!

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:36.488
Why would you tell her?!

01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:38.578
Evan, stop, let her go!

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:39.801
Tell me what?

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.023
I wasn't me!

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.523
She didn't tell me anything.

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:52.460
You just told me everything.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.191
It's all right.

01:00:58.193 --> 01:01:01.186
She's always like playing hard to get.

01:01:06.939 --> 01:01:08.877
Hey, it's all right.

01:01:08.879 --> 01:01:11.857
It's not a party until
something gets broken.

01:01:11.859 --> 01:01:13.159
Yeah, like my neck.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:41.767
Thanks for letting me stay here.

01:01:41.769 --> 01:01:45.227
I really didn't wanna go home tonight.

01:01:45.229 --> 01:01:46.627
Are you sure you wanna stay here?

01:01:46.629 --> 01:01:48.447
I can take the sofa, no problem.

01:01:48.449 --> 01:01:49.280
I don't wanna do that to you.

01:01:49.282 --> 01:01:50.837
I don't wanna kick you out of your bed.

01:01:50.839 --> 01:01:53.062
I mean, it's actually totally okay.

01:01:54.179 --> 01:01:55.332
What is that?

01:01:56.689 --> 01:01:57.767
Oh.

01:01:57.769 --> 01:01:58.600
That.

01:01:58.602 --> 01:01:59.569
That's a long story.

01:02:00.989 --> 01:02:03.537
Also the closest thing I've
had to a woman in my bedroom

01:02:03.539 --> 01:02:04.489
in a long time.

01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:07.477
Well, in this house in forever.

01:02:07.479 --> 01:02:09.878
As long as it's not a sex doll.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.711
What?

01:02:10.713 --> 01:02:11.987
Oh no, that would be weird.

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:14.821
Weirder than having a
mannequin in you bedroom?

01:02:17.619 --> 01:02:20.087
When I was in college, I
was a creative writing major

01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:22.727
who was thoroughly invested in her art

01:02:22.729 --> 01:02:24.999
and in hopes of attracting young ladies

01:02:25.001 --> 01:02:27.086
I came up with this backstory

01:02:27.088 --> 01:02:29.697
that the reason my dad
spiraled into alcoholism

01:02:29.699 --> 01:02:33.747
was because he lost his
job in a mannequin factory.

01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:37.012
I bet the ladies couldn't resist.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.197
Was any of that true?

01:02:40.199 --> 01:02:41.692
Only the alcoholism part.

01:02:42.579 --> 01:02:43.767
Oh.

01:02:43.769 --> 01:02:45.069
I didn't mean to go there.

01:02:46.969 --> 01:02:48.477
While we're on the topic,

01:02:48.479 --> 01:02:49.929
would you care for a bourbon?

01:02:50.879 --> 01:02:51.712
Sure.

01:02:56.328 --> 01:02:59.216
Oh, "A The Dummies'
Guide to the Dark Ages."

01:02:59.218 --> 01:03:01.368
I didn't know you were
into medieval stuff.

01:03:02.318 --> 01:03:03.151
Yeah, that's.

01:03:05.295 --> 01:03:08.305
"Let me show you how
a kiss should taste."

01:03:10.318 --> 01:03:11.706
Not ready for anyone to see that.

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:12.843
Ah, still in utero?

01:03:26.778 --> 01:03:31.376
Do you have a book full of
photos or Ryan somewhere

01:03:31.378 --> 01:03:34.916
or maybe a secret stash of photos

01:03:34.918 --> 01:03:36.836
on each one of your friends?

01:03:36.838 --> 01:03:38.581
No, you're my one and only.

01:03:44.935 --> 01:03:46.785
"Your eyes are blue-torched light."

01:03:53.135 --> 01:03:54.795
"Ice-kissed frost fire."

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:58.085
"My wasted heart melts there."

01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:01.321
It was you?

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:04.131
Yeah.

01:04:08.998 --> 01:04:11.662
You wrote that for Evan.

01:04:11.664 --> 01:04:13.776
No, no.

01:04:13.778 --> 01:04:15.766
I wrote that for you.

01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:18.181
For you to find.

01:04:22.688 --> 01:04:24.446
When you're alone and you
think no one's watching,

01:04:24.448 --> 01:04:27.166
you get this look on your face

01:04:27.168 --> 01:04:28.404
and I always wonder what you're thinking

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:30.856
because you look so sad

01:04:30.858 --> 01:04:32.651
but your eyes, they just,

01:04:33.796 --> 01:04:36.241
they turn the most
remarkable shade of blue.

01:04:38.818 --> 01:04:39.911
You notice that?

01:04:41.088 --> 01:04:44.581
Bridget, nothing about you
has ever escaped my attention.

01:04:51.078 --> 01:04:52.756
Maybe if you stare at
her house long enough,

01:04:52.758 --> 01:04:55.083
she'll decide she doesn't
want to divorce you anymore.

01:04:55.085 --> 01:04:56.334
That's what I'm hoping.

01:04:57.887 --> 01:04:59.875
This is technically trespassing.

01:04:59.877 --> 01:05:03.195
If we end up in jail, I'm
gonna miss Black Friday.

01:05:03.197 --> 01:05:05.725
Calm down, you'll
be out by Cyber Monday.

01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:06.560
What's that?

01:05:09.367 --> 01:05:10.935
Hey, Trista?

01:05:10.937 --> 01:05:12.285
Can you spend the night at my house?

01:05:12.287 --> 01:05:14.455
What's up with you being
afraid of your apartment?

01:05:14.457 --> 01:05:18.055
Evan says it's because I'm
paranoid from all the coke.

01:05:18.057 --> 01:05:19.935
Hey, can we talk about something?

01:05:19.937 --> 01:05:20.820
Shit.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:23.763
What's going on?

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:26.407
Oh, look.

01:05:28.317 --> 01:05:29.148
Oh no.

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.983
No, no, no, no.

01:05:31.367 --> 01:05:32.535
She's with someone.

01:05:32.537 --> 01:05:33.370
No way.

01:05:35.272 --> 01:05:37.085
That bitch.

01:05:37.087 --> 01:05:38.387
Maybe that's her sister.

01:05:42.067 --> 01:05:43.990
I really hope that's not her sister.

01:05:45.877 --> 01:05:46.708
I've had enough.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:48.021
Trista, no!

01:05:48.023 --> 01:05:49.273
Let go of me.

01:05:53.334 --> 01:05:55.334
I want to go fight her.

01:05:57.926 --> 01:06:00.105
I'm gonna fight her.

01:06:00.107 --> 01:06:02.760
Jesus Christ, you've got
freakish coke strength.

01:06:09.937 --> 01:06:12.725
Here we go, you're coming with me.

01:06:16.009 --> 01:06:17.706
I gotta go.

01:06:20.147 --> 01:06:20.980
Oh my God.

01:06:23.621 --> 01:06:25.335
I'm performing an intervention.

01:06:25.337 --> 01:06:26.170
Jesus.

01:06:27.925 --> 01:06:29.008
Don't move.

01:06:39.227 --> 01:06:41.115
Get off me!

01:06:41.117 --> 01:06:42.875
You may be stronger than me

01:06:42.877 --> 01:06:44.195
but I am meaner.

01:06:44.197 --> 01:06:46.441
And you are not going into that house.

01:06:56.196 --> 01:06:58.675
Evan's always been the one, you know?

01:06:58.677 --> 01:07:02.714
I never even had any other
girlfriends in high school.

01:07:02.716 --> 01:07:04.124
Believe it or not,

01:07:04.126 --> 01:07:05.507
I was kinda of a geek.

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:09.779
Sometimes I do wonder,

01:07:10.796 --> 01:07:12.181
I think to myself,

01:07:12.183 --> 01:07:14.970
"What if Evan hadn't
picked me up that night?"

01:07:14.972 --> 01:07:19.114
I don't necessarily subscribe
to M-Theory or String Theory

01:07:19.116 --> 01:07:21.139
but the very possibility of a multiverse

01:07:21.141 --> 01:07:22.633
has got to make you wonder.

01:07:22.635 --> 01:07:26.469
Well, if you hadn't been with
Evan, we never would've met.

01:07:27.586 --> 01:07:30.689
I thought I'd be angry, furious, upset.

01:07:32.026 --> 01:07:33.856
Instead, I just feel...

01:07:35.386 --> 01:07:36.509
Emptiness.

01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:43.169
Speaking of emptiness.

01:07:47.756 --> 01:07:51.094
The reason I spend so
much time around Evan

01:07:51.096 --> 01:07:53.076
is because wherever she is

01:07:54.936 --> 01:07:56.684
you are there too.

01:07:56.686 --> 01:07:57.517
Huh?

01:07:57.519 --> 01:08:00.384
And I think the reason
I'm not seeing anyone

01:08:00.386 --> 01:08:02.726
or looking to meet anyone is because

01:08:04.366 --> 01:08:06.036
to me you are perfect.

01:08:08.086 --> 01:08:09.584
Oh my God.

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:10.986
Since the moment I met you

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:12.920
I've been

01:08:14.346 --> 01:08:15.239
secretly,

01:08:16.206 --> 01:08:17.179
madly,

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:20.529
in love with you.

01:08:24.836 --> 01:08:26.676
How could I not have seen this?

01:08:31.466 --> 01:08:33.323
How could I not have seen you?

01:08:33.326 --> 01:08:35.076
I wish I could just

01:08:36.148 --> 01:08:39.823
cut you into a million pieces
and scatter you across the sky

01:08:39.826 --> 01:08:41.439
and count you like stars.

01:08:42.926 --> 01:08:44.555
I think that

01:08:45.626 --> 01:08:49.899
is the most romantic thing
anyone has ever said to me.

01:09:19.005 --> 01:09:21.895
I've loved you since
the moment I saw you.

01:09:21.897 --> 01:09:26.897
Not a day's gone by I
haven't dreamed of this!

01:09:35.745 --> 01:09:36.578
I'm sorry.

01:09:37.425 --> 01:09:38.808
I don't know why I did that.

01:09:40.532 --> 01:09:42.470
You're a goddess.

01:10:27.329 --> 01:10:29.399
My bra.

01:11:01.225 --> 01:11:05.308
You're the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

01:11:29.462 --> 01:11:31.082
Hey.

01:11:31.084 --> 01:11:31.917
Hey.

01:11:38.951 --> 01:11:40.315
Wait.

01:11:40.317 --> 01:11:41.650
I wanna see you.

01:11:47.354 --> 01:11:48.514
There you are.

01:12:04.493 --> 01:12:05.564
Trista?

01:12:05.566 --> 01:12:06.397
It's Evan.

01:12:08.015 --> 01:12:10.120
How is she here?

01:12:10.122 --> 01:12:12.483
No one locked the door!

01:12:12.485 --> 01:12:13.316
Hold on.

01:12:13.318 --> 01:12:14.751
Shit!

01:12:15.826 --> 01:12:17.409
Hold on one minute.

01:12:22.427 --> 01:12:23.972
A thousand pardons

01:12:23.974 --> 01:12:26.697
for my behavior last night.

01:12:28.464 --> 01:12:31.162
I know you are not the
one who told Bridget.

01:12:31.164 --> 01:12:33.352
I know you wouldn't do that.

01:12:33.354 --> 01:12:34.592
Hey.

01:12:34.594 --> 01:12:37.282
Now is not the best time right now.

01:12:37.284 --> 01:12:38.817
If you know what I mean.

01:12:41.079 --> 01:12:42.972
Oh shit.

01:12:42.974 --> 01:12:44.858
You have a girl back there?

01:12:46.504 --> 01:12:48.547
Yeah, I can't wait to
tell you all about it.

01:12:48.549 --> 01:12:50.242
I gotta tell you, I
always wondered about you.

01:12:50.244 --> 01:12:52.202
I thought maybe you were
one of those straight girls

01:12:52.204 --> 01:12:53.252
who pretends to be gay

01:12:53.254 --> 01:12:55.572
because she thinks it
makes her more interesting.

01:12:55.574 --> 01:12:57.411
Evan, you have no idea.

01:12:57.413 --> 01:12:58.541
Oh.

01:12:58.543 --> 01:13:01.296
Hey, just confirm for me
that it's a woman in there.

01:13:10.183 --> 01:13:11.783
This isn't what it looks like.

01:13:12.693 --> 01:13:14.743
It looks like you fucked my girlfriend.

01:13:16.813 --> 01:13:19.846
That's exactly what it looks like.

01:13:21.323 --> 01:13:23.316
You know it wasn't her idea, Evan.

01:13:26.833 --> 01:13:28.761
I know that if we fight, you'll win,

01:13:28.763 --> 01:13:31.391
but I will inflict as much
damage on you as possible

01:13:31.393 --> 01:13:32.311
before you bring me down.

01:13:32.313 --> 01:13:33.731
And you will have to kill me

01:13:33.733 --> 01:13:35.633
before I let you go anywhere near her.

01:13:39.013 --> 01:13:41.806
You got a lot of, what is
that word you people use?

01:13:42.873 --> 01:13:44.531
Chutzpah?

01:13:44.533 --> 01:13:45.930
Yeah, chutzpah.

01:13:47.363 --> 01:13:48.581
Stop it, Evan.

01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:50.436
Do not speak to me!

01:13:55.213 --> 01:13:57.876
Do not ever come back to my house again.

01:13:59.663 --> 01:14:01.446
I don't ever wanna see your face.

01:14:56.422 --> 01:14:57.255
Hey.

01:14:58.642 --> 01:15:00.190
Hey!

01:15:00.192 --> 01:15:01.565
Hey, sleepyhead.

01:15:02.545 --> 01:15:03.505
What time is it?

01:15:04.652 --> 01:15:06.310
Time for me to go to work.

01:15:06.312 --> 01:15:09.100
I'll be in so much
trouble if I'm late again.

01:15:09.102 --> 01:15:10.640
How long have I been here?

01:15:10.642 --> 01:15:12.585
Hello, since we got back.

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:14.940
Wait.

01:15:14.942 --> 01:15:18.060
We went to Paige's, you tackled me

01:15:18.062 --> 01:15:22.057
and why don't I remember
anything after that?

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:25.260
We came back here and
you were super upset

01:15:25.262 --> 01:15:27.560
and I have some diazepam, so...

01:15:27.562 --> 01:15:29.130
How much did you give me?

01:15:29.132 --> 01:15:30.850
You asked for a loading dose.

01:15:30.852 --> 01:15:32.170
Fuck.

01:15:32.172 --> 01:15:34.720
And I don't play so I got out
these old pharmacy textbooks

01:15:34.722 --> 01:15:38.121
and I asked you your weight
and I added 20 pounds

01:15:38.123 --> 01:15:42.258
because I know I always take
off 20 when anyone asks me.

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.420
I gotta get out of here.

01:15:43.422 --> 01:15:44.472
I wouldn't do that.

01:15:46.632 --> 01:15:47.465
Oh no.

01:15:55.612 --> 01:15:57.735
Like I said, a loading dose.

01:15:58.792 --> 01:15:59.725
Up we go.

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:04.145
This is why my wife left me.

01:16:06.682 --> 01:16:09.463
No one should have to live like this.

01:16:09.465 --> 01:16:11.715
I decline my invitation
to your pity party.

01:16:14.962 --> 01:16:18.519
This is like "Whatever
Happened to Baby Jane."

01:16:19.644 --> 01:16:20.990
And I'm baby Jane.

01:16:20.992 --> 01:16:22.820
If the rule that you
followed led you here,

01:16:22.822 --> 01:16:24.425
of what use was the rule?

01:16:30.389 --> 01:16:33.040
You dare get existential on me now.

01:16:33.042 --> 01:16:36.045
You're Monday-morning
quarterbacking your entire life.

01:17:02.811 --> 01:17:03.644
Shoot.

01:17:10.161 --> 01:17:11.698
You scared me.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.374
I had your things sent to you.

01:17:14.401 --> 01:17:17.301
Yeah, well, you forgot some
of my weapons, so here I am.

01:17:18.411 --> 01:17:19.969
I thought you'd be sleeping.

01:17:19.971 --> 01:17:22.529
I've reverted to my old schedule.

01:17:22.531 --> 01:17:25.324
Sleep by day, live by night.

01:17:27.661 --> 01:17:28.979
What about your job?

01:17:28.981 --> 01:17:30.581
Oh yeah, I haven't been going.

01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:32.564
Why?

01:17:35.231 --> 01:17:37.999
My dad took a contribution
from an organization

01:17:38.001 --> 01:17:41.109
whose leader once said that
gays should be rounded up

01:17:41.111 --> 01:17:42.334
and thrown off cliffs.

01:17:43.391 --> 01:17:44.341
Are you quitting?

01:17:52.821 --> 01:17:54.449
I moved in with Ryan.

01:17:54.451 --> 01:17:55.284
I heard.

01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:57.096
Will I also be footing the bill

01:17:57.098 --> 01:17:58.764
for your share of Ryan's rent?

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:01.589
I don't have to listen to this.

01:18:01.591 --> 01:18:02.424
Sweets,

01:18:04.241 --> 01:18:05.941
you couldn't ignore me if you try.

01:18:07.111 --> 01:18:08.819
Don't throw that in my face!

01:18:08.821 --> 01:18:09.652
What?

01:18:09.654 --> 01:18:11.779
That I've been paying for
your Ivy League education?

01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:13.249
Or that I have supported you for years

01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:18.251
and I've only asked you for
one, one thing, in return?!

01:18:18.711 --> 01:18:21.739
How could I marry someone
who did what you did to me?

01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:22.809
I did nothing to you!

01:18:22.811 --> 01:18:23.729
Yeah, that's right,

01:18:23.731 --> 01:18:25.289
you were too busy doing
it to someone else!

01:18:25.291 --> 01:18:26.649
You let Dov fuck you!

01:18:26.651 --> 01:18:29.529
I know it wasn't the other
way around, pillow princess.

01:18:29.531 --> 01:18:31.614
You've always been more of a taker.

01:18:33.211 --> 01:18:37.089
You have fucked everyone and everything

01:18:37.091 --> 01:18:39.391
and you've been doing
it since the day we met!

01:18:40.711 --> 01:18:41.544
And I,

01:18:43.531 --> 01:18:45.509
I loved you too much to admit to myself

01:18:45.511 --> 01:18:46.342
what I knew to be true.

01:18:46.344 --> 01:18:48.399
Love me or you needed me?

01:18:48.401 --> 01:18:50.159
Which one, Bridget?

01:18:50.161 --> 01:18:50.994
You love me?

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:54.489
It's very easy to be
taken care of, isn't it?

01:18:54.491 --> 01:18:56.988
Makes it so much easier
not to see the things

01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:58.420
you don't want to.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.331
What changed it for you?

01:19:01.333 --> 01:19:03.600
What made you go, "You know,
I've had a really great time

01:19:03.602 --> 01:19:05.185
"not having to work for anything

01:19:05.187 --> 01:19:06.515
"but now I think I'm gonna get rid of

01:19:06.517 --> 01:19:08.007
"good old reliable Evan."

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.373
I fucking love you!

01:19:13.333 --> 01:19:16.718
I've loved you since I was 18 years old.

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.528
Not a day has gone by since

01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:21.328
that you haven't been the
love of my fucking life!

01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:23.918
I know you're a cheater,
I know you screw around.

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.321
That is why I wouldn't marry you!

01:19:26.323 --> 01:19:29.058
I will stop fucking around
when I have tangible proof

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.221
that you're not in this for a free ride.

01:19:30.223 --> 01:19:32.278
You had something better than tangible,

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.698
you had something real!

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.550
You're discussing us in past tense.

01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:39.447
Doesn't get any more real than that.

01:19:42.168 --> 01:19:43.941
Shut up for a second.

01:19:43.943 --> 01:19:45.360
Shut the fuck up.

01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:49.460
Or maybe it was your guilt that was real.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.858
And why would I feel guilty, Evan?

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.578
I've always been there for
you when no one else was.

01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.963
Maybe you were guilting
yourself into staying with me.

01:20:02.921 --> 01:20:04.451
Stupid.

01:20:04.453 --> 01:20:06.003
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:11.218
You are telling me that
you've been fucking around

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.555
this whole time because you thought

01:20:13.557 --> 01:20:15.988
I felt I owed you something?!

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:18.152
That I was using you?!

01:20:18.154 --> 01:20:21.388
And all you had to do was
ask me and I woulda told you

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:22.933
that none of that was true!

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:28.953
I love you.

01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:32.448
I love you! I love you!

01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:33.413
I love you!

01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:41.228
Say

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:42.063
something.

01:20:47.513 --> 01:20:49.013
Good luck in the real world.

01:21:07.289 --> 01:21:09.139
This is the part where I leave you.

01:21:55.616 --> 01:21:58.224
"The Shipwreck Diaries.

01:21:58.226 --> 01:22:01.359
"A Novel by Dov Dolenz."

01:22:03.489 --> 01:22:04.792
You wrote a book?

01:22:08.519 --> 01:22:09.352
Yeah.

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:12.377
Let's go read it.

01:22:12.379 --> 01:22:13.212
Okay.

01:22:26.352 --> 01:22:27.497
Dov.

01:22:27.499 --> 01:22:28.332
Yeah?

01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:31.292
This is amazing.

01:22:32.919 --> 01:22:34.117
Are you sure?

01:22:34.119 --> 01:22:35.987
I mean, I've had women say that before

01:22:35.989 --> 01:22:38.942
but I haven't always
trusted their sincerity.

01:22:38.944 --> 01:22:39.777
Yes.

01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:43.717
This is so exciting, I
mean, you wrote a book.

01:22:43.719 --> 01:22:45.937
I'll be back to writing
engagement announcements tomorrow.

01:22:45.939 --> 01:22:48.722
Yeah, maybe, but this
book is gonna be big.

01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:51.922
When did you do this?

01:22:52.809 --> 01:22:54.407
The last three nights I just stayed up.

01:22:54.409 --> 01:22:55.731
It was pouring out of me.

01:22:56.798 --> 01:22:57.631
It was you.

01:22:59.428 --> 01:23:02.378
Bridget, I couldn't have written
this if it wasn't for you.

01:23:08.488 --> 01:23:09.321
Dov.

01:23:44.908 --> 01:23:47.081
Can I be godmother
to your finger babies?

01:23:49.768 --> 01:23:50.601
Very funny.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.769
I need to share this book with Ryan.

01:24:03.771 --> 01:24:04.602
No

01:24:04.604 --> 01:24:05.437
I gotta show her.

01:24:07.968 --> 01:24:10.098
Yeah, yes, yes, yes.

01:24:25.618 --> 01:24:26.781
I'll be back.

01:24:33.961 --> 01:24:37.711
Ryan, Dov wrote a novel
and it's really good.

01:24:38.934 --> 01:24:40.506
"The Shipwreck Diaries."

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:42.008
I loved that when I was a kid.

01:24:42.848 --> 01:24:45.531
This is Dov's book.

01:24:46.828 --> 01:24:47.766
Gotta split.

01:24:47.768 --> 01:24:49.639
One of my friends is waiting on me.

01:24:49.641 --> 01:24:51.786
Have I got any messages?

01:24:51.788 --> 01:24:53.057
Is my dad dead?

01:24:53.059 --> 01:24:53.890
Dad-dead.

01:24:53.892 --> 01:24:54.945
Ryan, are these the new friends

01:24:54.947 --> 01:24:56.525
that Evan had to save you from?

01:24:56.527 --> 01:24:59.130
Oh, that Evan, telling
tales out of school.

01:25:05.927 --> 01:25:07.460
She's falling apart.

01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:10.537
Hey, even the Sistine
Chapel is crumbling.

01:25:12.197 --> 01:25:13.030
Yeah.

01:25:14.577 --> 01:25:15.410
Dov,

01:25:17.447 --> 01:25:18.350
your book.

01:25:19.577 --> 01:25:20.935
Second thoughts.

01:25:20.937 --> 01:25:22.875
Not as great as you thought
it was five minutes ago?

01:25:22.877 --> 01:25:23.915
It's amazing.

01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:26.950
It's just the characters,

01:25:28.417 --> 01:25:30.265
it's us, right, the gang?

01:25:30.267 --> 01:25:32.745
You, me, Trista,

01:25:32.747 --> 01:25:34.085
Evan, Ryan?

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:36.640
Yeah but I'm not
anticipating any lawsuits.

01:25:39.387 --> 01:25:40.722
And I'm Kahlan

01:25:40.724 --> 01:25:41.760
and you're Cara?

01:25:43.127 --> 01:25:44.856
Pretty obvious, huh?

01:25:44.858 --> 01:25:46.025
And Kahlan and Cara,

01:25:46.027 --> 01:25:48.135
they wind up together in the end, right?

01:25:48.137 --> 01:25:50.495
Specifically moving in
together and getting married.

01:25:50.497 --> 01:25:54.015
Oh, right, but Bridget,
it's just a book.

01:25:54.017 --> 01:25:57.100
I've been up the past
two days, three days.

01:25:59.034 --> 01:26:01.394
It's all artistic license.

01:26:01.396 --> 01:26:02.229
I know.

01:26:04.817 --> 01:26:06.540
I just need you to understand,

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:10.630
I just got out of a really bad situation.

01:26:12.307 --> 01:26:14.705
Is this what you think
this is, a bad situation?

01:26:14.707 --> 01:26:15.710
No, no.

01:26:18.675 --> 01:26:19.990
It's wonderful.

01:26:21.567 --> 01:26:24.010
But it's still a situation.

01:26:25.654 --> 01:26:26.487
Oh.

01:26:27.827 --> 01:26:28.660
Okay.

01:26:30.177 --> 01:26:32.122
That night, when I
found out you'd written

01:26:32.124 --> 01:26:33.510
"blue torch light" for me,

01:26:34.397 --> 01:26:36.607
and then you wrote
another poem on the spot

01:26:38.007 --> 01:26:41.465
and beautiful words were
just coming out of you.

01:26:41.467 --> 01:26:43.700
Beautiful words always come out of you.

01:26:44.717 --> 01:26:49.405
I just got so lost in
everything that you were saying

01:26:49.407 --> 01:26:51.905
and in everything that you are.

01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:53.400
And I'm really good in bed.

01:27:00.089 --> 01:27:02.139
It's easy to fall in love with someone.

01:27:04.926 --> 01:27:06.949
Falling out of love,

01:27:07.816 --> 01:27:10.139
that is a lot harder.

01:27:12.266 --> 01:27:14.416
It always comes back
to Evan, doesn't it?

01:27:17.236 --> 01:27:18.256
I wish...

01:27:19.826 --> 01:27:20.659
I...

01:27:23.446 --> 01:27:25.919
I wish I could forget.

01:27:26.876 --> 01:27:27.709
But...

01:27:29.996 --> 01:27:31.546
She's been the love of my life.

01:27:39.206 --> 01:27:40.405
Okay.

01:27:40.407 --> 01:27:41.779
I understand.

01:27:43.976 --> 01:27:45.389
You gave me the inspiration.

01:27:46.966 --> 01:27:49.799
I got the book but I lost the girl.

01:27:50.976 --> 01:27:55.604
You are gonna get so
much more out of this book

01:27:55.606 --> 01:27:57.179
than you ever would me.

01:27:58.716 --> 01:28:00.229
I respectfully disagree.

01:28:07.306 --> 01:28:08.659
I don't wanna lose you.

01:28:12.283 --> 01:28:13.116
I need you.

01:28:19.916 --> 01:28:20.766
I need you too.

01:28:31.046 --> 01:28:33.224
Nobody understands the
rules for the Brat Pack.

01:28:33.226 --> 01:28:36.024
The rules for the Brat Pack are, A,

01:28:36.026 --> 01:28:38.304
starring in either "St. Elmo's Fire"

01:28:38.306 --> 01:28:39.464
or "The Breakfast Club,"

01:28:39.466 --> 01:28:41.374
and B, being in at least one other movie

01:28:41.376 --> 01:28:43.044
with anther Brat Packer.

01:28:43.046 --> 01:28:45.314
So that's eight people.

01:28:45.316 --> 01:28:47.104
Judd Nelson,

01:28:47.106 --> 01:28:48.604
Rob Lowe,

01:28:48.606 --> 01:28:50.214
Molly Ringwald,

01:28:50.216 --> 01:28:52.154
Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez,

01:28:52.156 --> 01:28:54.574
Ally Sheedy, Andrew McCarthy,

01:28:54.576 --> 01:28:57.023
and last but certainly not least,

01:28:57.025 --> 01:28:58.083
Demi Moore.

01:28:58.085 --> 01:28:59.053
Who didn't make the cut?

01:28:59.055 --> 01:29:00.473
Mare Winningham.

01:29:00.475 --> 01:29:02.803
Mare was in "St. Elmo's Fire"

01:29:02.805 --> 01:29:05.405
but never in another movie
with another Brat Packer.

01:29:10.524 --> 01:29:11.863
Mare Winningham.

01:29:11.865 --> 01:29:12.793
Who is he?

01:29:12.795 --> 01:29:16.008
Oh my God, I don't even
know why I talk to you.

01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:20.283
Whenever you start talking
about pistachios and inter...

01:29:20.285 --> 01:29:22.303
Pastiche and intertertextuality.

01:29:22.305 --> 01:29:24.013
Right, intertertextuality.

01:29:24.015 --> 01:29:27.113
It sounds like a new sexual orientation.

01:29:27.115 --> 01:29:29.865
If you were on the Table
of Elements, you'd be moron.

01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:37.438
Yeah, it's me!

01:29:48.467 --> 01:29:50.217
Is your phone hot?

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:07.401
Evan?

01:30:13.451 --> 01:30:14.284
Evan?

01:30:18.611 --> 01:30:19.444
Evan?

01:30:26.733 --> 01:30:27.566
Evan.

01:30:29.671 --> 01:30:30.668
Evan.

01:30:33.305 --> 01:30:34.883
Hey.

01:30:34.885 --> 01:30:35.716
Evan!

01:30:35.718 --> 01:30:36.558
Come on, wake up!

01:30:40.255 --> 01:30:41.088
Evan.

01:30:56.454 --> 01:30:57.592
I had to.

01:30:57.594 --> 01:30:59.987
Why are you here?

01:31:01.044 --> 01:31:01.877
Again!

01:31:03.173 --> 01:31:04.117
Fuck!

01:31:05.864 --> 01:31:07.442
Nice, She-Ra.

01:31:07.444 --> 01:31:08.855
It's invaluable, okay?

01:31:08.857 --> 01:31:10.432
I couldn't leave it in the car.

01:31:10.434 --> 01:31:12.712
It's nice to know you
cherish something so dearly.

01:31:12.714 --> 01:31:14.402
Why haven't you been taking my calls?

01:31:14.404 --> 01:31:15.682
I'm focused on the future.

01:31:15.684 --> 01:31:18.062
Not the past.

01:31:18.064 --> 01:31:21.572
This isn't about me and
you, Evan, this is about Ryan.

01:31:21.574 --> 01:31:23.702
She called me while I was
at the museum, crying.

01:31:23.704 --> 01:31:25.019
She said the debt collectors
are coming to take away

01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:27.161
all of her stuff tomorrow.

01:31:27.163 --> 01:31:28.272
I thought she was loaded.

01:31:28.274 --> 01:31:31.222
I don't understand it
anymore than you do but

01:31:31.224 --> 01:31:33.502
she said she's gonna lock
herself in her bathroom

01:31:33.504 --> 01:31:35.962
and drown herself in the bathtub.

01:31:35.964 --> 01:31:38.264
That is literally an
impossible thing to do.

01:31:40.044 --> 01:31:42.262
Well we have to do something.

01:31:42.264 --> 01:31:44.192
This is not am MP.

01:31:44.194 --> 01:31:45.027
It's a YP.

01:31:46.474 --> 01:31:48.152
Your problem.

01:31:48.154 --> 01:31:49.232
Evan, what's wrong with you?

01:31:49.234 --> 01:31:50.757
This is Ryan.

01:31:52.014 --> 01:31:53.327
She needs our help.

01:32:25.694 --> 01:32:27.651
Oh, I gotta get this off.

01:32:34.192 --> 01:32:35.275
Get this off.

01:32:36.683 --> 01:32:41.023
Oh, my baby.

01:32:41.025 --> 01:32:41.858
Thank you.

01:32:47.129 --> 01:32:48.111
Bridget.

01:32:48.113 --> 01:32:48.946
What?

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:54.172
Ryan?

01:32:54.174 --> 01:32:55.501
Stay away!

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:57.201
If you come any closer, I'll jump.

01:32:57.203 --> 01:32:59.241
Oh, for the love of.

01:32:59.243 --> 01:33:01.171
Ryan, sweetheart,

01:33:01.173 --> 01:33:02.611
we've all been there.

01:33:02.613 --> 01:33:04.681
Remember that time I
crashed my dad's Delorean

01:33:04.683 --> 01:33:06.851
and decided to drink myself to death?

01:33:06.853 --> 01:33:09.403
You stayed up all night
with me feeding me edamame.

01:33:11.033 --> 01:33:12.524
We're gonna call the police
if you don't stop this.

01:33:12.526 --> 01:33:14.431
I'll throw myself over the railing

01:33:14.433 --> 01:33:15.761
before you even get to the phone.

01:33:15.763 --> 01:33:17.806
Maybe threatening her
wasn't the best idea.

01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:22.193
What the fuck is it now?

01:33:22.195 --> 01:33:23.612
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:33:28.693 --> 01:33:31.031
You invite Dov to
Ryan's nervous breakdown?

01:33:31.033 --> 01:33:31.864
I called everyone.

01:33:31.866 --> 01:33:33.186
It's a real party.

01:33:38.373 --> 01:33:39.981
How is she?

01:33:39.983 --> 01:33:42.541
Ryan, you're scaring us.

01:33:42.543 --> 01:33:44.141
Leave me alone.

01:33:44.143 --> 01:33:46.241
Honey, look,

01:33:46.243 --> 01:33:48.921
at that distance, with your
weight at that velocity,

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:52.131
you'd be more likely to
break your legs than die.

01:33:52.133 --> 01:33:53.171
Keep talking to her like that

01:33:53.173 --> 01:33:55.341
and she'll definitely
decide to kill herself.

01:33:55.343 --> 01:33:56.565
Honey, why don't you let us just,

01:33:56.567 --> 01:33:59.540
you look so tired, we'll come
up there and talk to you.

01:34:00.999 --> 01:34:02.281
I heard you wrote a book.

01:34:02.283 --> 01:34:03.116
Yeah.

01:34:04.383 --> 01:34:05.216
Wanna read it?

01:34:14.562 --> 01:34:16.111
Evan, don't mess around!

01:34:16.113 --> 01:34:17.521
Evan, stop it, that's priceless.

01:34:17.523 --> 01:34:18.751
I mean, invaluable.

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:21.131
Me or the sword?

01:34:21.133 --> 01:34:23.900
Fuck, it's turning into Hamlet in here.

01:34:23.902 --> 01:34:28.902
I hope they all die in the end.

01:34:29.593 --> 01:34:31.581
You stole the thing I love most.

01:34:31.583 --> 01:34:33.321
Maybe if you hadn't
treated her like a thing,

01:34:33.323 --> 01:34:34.773
I wouldn't have been able to.

01:34:35.723 --> 01:34:37.941
Evan, you can do tens
of thousands of dollars

01:34:37.943 --> 01:34:39.341
worth of damage to that sword.

01:34:39.343 --> 01:34:40.958
Okay, she's worried about the sword.

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:43.091
I'm not concerned with
consequences anymore.

01:34:43.093 --> 01:34:44.801
Thanks to your little pep talk.

01:34:44.803 --> 01:34:46.103
What did you say to her?

01:34:47.633 --> 01:34:50.951
Maybe I told her I
was leaving her for good

01:34:50.953 --> 01:34:52.741
and then maybe I hit her?

01:34:52.743 --> 01:34:53.921
Okay, okay.

01:34:53.923 --> 01:34:55.650
She's armed like a knife
and pushed to the brink

01:34:55.652 --> 01:34:57.420
and I fucked her girlfriend.

01:34:57.422 --> 01:34:59.245
Any last words, Dov Dolenz?

01:35:01.672 --> 01:35:02.505
I love her.

01:35:08.197 --> 01:35:09.114
I love her.

01:35:10.612 --> 01:35:11.445
I love her.

01:35:15.578 --> 01:35:17.535
There is no peace in the Middle East.

01:35:17.537 --> 01:35:19.820
This could technically be
construed as a hate crime.

01:35:19.822 --> 01:35:22.516
This is an act of war!

01:35:32.562 --> 01:35:34.310
I think you may have anger issues.

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:36.200
You don't need to worry about anything.

01:35:36.202 --> 01:35:37.772
Not where you're going.

01:35:48.418 --> 01:35:50.408
Fuck!

01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:51.639
Fuck!

01:36:03.582 --> 01:36:05.672
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:36:05.674 --> 01:36:07.294
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:36:07.296 --> 01:36:08.129
Oh my God!

01:36:24.626 --> 01:36:25.910
Just...

01:36:25.912 --> 01:36:27.114
Just let me have a look at it.

01:36:27.116 --> 01:36:28.430
No!

01:36:28.432 --> 01:36:31.895
None of you bitches touches me!

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:35.433
Evan?

01:36:37.372 --> 01:36:38.770
Are you okay?

01:36:38.772 --> 01:36:39.603
Me?

01:36:39.605 --> 01:36:41.185
I'm fit as fucking fiddle.

01:36:42.522 --> 01:36:43.800
You have a knife in your back.

01:36:43.802 --> 01:36:45.065
Yeah, I gathered.

01:36:48.932 --> 01:36:50.460
Dov, call an ambulance.

01:36:50.462 --> 01:36:52.010
Where's the phone?

01:36:52.012 --> 01:36:53.275
Should we pull it out?

01:36:53.277 --> 01:36:54.110
No!

01:36:58.703 --> 01:37:01.620
What have I done, Evan?

01:37:09.721 --> 01:37:10.664
Oh, shit.

01:37:47.751 --> 01:37:49.349
That's better.

01:37:49.351 --> 01:37:50.289
What's wrong?

01:37:50.291 --> 01:37:52.539
Did you run out of money?

01:37:52.541 --> 01:37:53.374
We can help you.

01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.069
It's not that.

01:37:56.071 --> 01:37:57.034
It's my dad.

01:37:58.511 --> 01:37:59.342
Did he die?

01:37:59.344 --> 01:38:00.175
I'm so sorry.

01:38:00.177 --> 01:38:01.884
No, that fucker's alive and well.

01:38:02.941 --> 01:38:04.191
He was never really sick.

01:38:05.251 --> 01:38:06.784
I made the whole thing up.

01:38:08.211 --> 01:38:09.411
Why would you do that?

01:38:10.333 --> 01:38:12.174
He cut me out of his life.

01:38:13.251 --> 01:38:15.219
Not just financially.

01:38:15.221 --> 01:38:16.054
Completely.

01:38:19.101 --> 01:38:19.934
What happened?

01:38:20.921 --> 01:38:23.059
His daughter is a lesbian.

01:38:23.061 --> 01:38:26.714
I fuck women and that is
enough to make him hate me.

01:38:27.721 --> 01:38:28.964
He disposed of me.

01:38:31.611 --> 01:38:32.444
He's not dead.

01:38:33.441 --> 01:38:34.641
I'm the one that's dead.

01:38:35.491 --> 01:38:37.089
Dead to him.

01:38:37.091 --> 01:38:39.105
Honey, you could've told us.

01:38:39.107 --> 01:38:40.307
I was too embarrassed.

01:38:42.461 --> 01:38:43.611
So I said he was dying.

01:38:45.251 --> 01:38:46.544
It seemed easier.

01:38:48.921 --> 01:38:51.631
I was just so ashamed

01:38:53.471 --> 01:38:56.458
and now I'm angry at myself

01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:59.203
for feeling ashamed.

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:01.690
It should be him.

01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:06.088
He should be the one who hates himself.

01:39:06.090 --> 01:39:06.921
Not me.

01:39:06.923 --> 01:39:07.756
You know,

01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:10.668
when we're growing up,

01:39:10.670 --> 01:39:11.808
when we're kids,

01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:13.758
we know there's something
different about us.

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.633
Yeah, I knew I liked
girls from the age of five.

01:39:17.483 --> 01:39:18.748
I've always been ahead of the curve.

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:19.948
When we know there's something different

01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:21.728
and we can't put words to it.

01:39:21.730 --> 01:39:23.853
That turns into self-loathing.

01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:26.798
Then we get a little older

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:29.108
and we realize that society doesn't accept

01:39:29.110 --> 01:39:30.868
the parts of us that make us different

01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:34.823
and that self-loathing turns in to shame.

01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:37.768
I'm stronger than that.

01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:38.928
I know you are.

01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:40.428
You're a tough cookie but

01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:43.188
you can't fix what your
family and society did to you.

01:39:43.190 --> 01:39:45.183
You can't un-fuck up a kid.

01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:50.437
I'm not getting five
thousand a month anymore.

01:39:50.439 --> 01:39:52.568
I had some money saved up.

01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:54.963
I spent it all.

01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:58.503
I just wanted the hurt to go away.

01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:01.493
Who does that?

01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:04.668
What kind of man turns
his back on his daughter

01:40:04.670 --> 01:40:05.888
just because she's gay?

01:40:05.890 --> 01:40:07.768
You don't need him.

01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:10.498
Okay, you have me and those
three losers downstairs

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.998
who would do anything for you.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.328
Ryan, the four of us would die for you.

01:40:16.330 --> 01:40:18.668
Fuck your dad, he's not your dad.

01:40:18.670 --> 01:40:19.838
Evan's your dad.

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.528
And us, we're the rest
of your fucked up family.

01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:26.263
I'm just so confused.

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.113
Everything hurts.

01:40:30.610 --> 01:40:31.443
I'm so

01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:33.903
totally

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:35.873
lost.

01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:38.158
Well,

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:39.258
with those words,

01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:42.158
I officially pronounce you

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:43.203
a grownup.

01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:50.588
Did you know I always
wanted to make you coffee?

01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:52.190
The way you do it with the foam.

01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.977
I was gonna surprise you
once, you were at the museum,

01:40:54.979 --> 01:40:57.477
you were gonna come home and find it.

01:40:57.479 --> 01:40:59.202
I tried but I failed.

01:41:00.211 --> 01:41:02.525
I threw it all out and never told you.

01:41:02.527 --> 01:41:03.952
I called an ambulance.

01:41:06.857 --> 01:41:08.197
Oh, shit.

01:41:08.199 --> 01:41:10.399
I don't like doing
things I'm not good at.

01:41:12.668 --> 01:41:14.017
Evan,

01:41:14.019 --> 01:41:17.382
this is for the pain.

01:41:22.348 --> 01:41:23.496
Okay.

01:41:23.498 --> 01:41:26.907
Fuck, this jacket is vintage.

01:41:26.909 --> 01:41:28.807
What the fuck happened here?

01:41:28.809 --> 01:41:30.647
Bridget stabbed me in the back.

01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:31.987
I know, sweetie.

01:41:31.989 --> 01:41:34.162
No, this time,

01:41:35.269 --> 01:41:36.777
I really did stab her.

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:39.590
Jesus.

01:41:39.592 --> 01:41:41.107
Dov called an ambulance.

01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:42.539
It should be here soon.

01:41:44.029 --> 01:41:46.037
So, Ryan tries to commit suicide

01:41:46.039 --> 01:41:47.677
and you three bitches find a way

01:41:47.679 --> 01:41:49.322
to make it all about yourselves.

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:52.964
Is that one of
Bridget's ancient daggers?

01:41:52.966 --> 01:41:54.237
I believe so.

01:41:54.239 --> 01:41:56.447
If that thing is 500 years old,

01:41:56.449 --> 01:41:59.687
you're gonna have one
hell of an infection.

01:41:59.689 --> 01:42:01.452
Do not forget your dying king.

01:42:02.429 --> 01:42:03.557
Is she gonna die?

01:42:03.559 --> 01:42:06.159
No, baby, but I'm about
to pass out from the pain.

01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:08.682
Goodnight, sweet prince.

01:42:10.155 --> 01:42:13.262
May flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.

01:42:14.239 --> 01:42:17.165
So what have I learned
after all this time?

01:42:17.167 --> 01:42:19.917
After all the fucking and partying.

01:42:19.919 --> 01:42:22.669
Lying to friends, lovers, myself.

01:42:22.671 --> 01:42:26.066
Playing this sick game in this sick world,

01:42:26.068 --> 01:42:29.812
filled with liars and cheaters
and depraved miscreants.

01:42:32.069 --> 01:42:34.117
I'll tell you what I've learned.

01:42:34.119 --> 01:42:36.789
One thing, and one thing only...

01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:41.372
I fucking love being gay!

01:42:44.239 --> 01:42:47.067
Hey, Evan, are you still there?

01:42:47.069 --> 01:42:48.547
Yeah.

01:42:48.549 --> 01:42:50.625
I thought you were about
to pass out right then.

01:42:50.627 --> 01:42:52.822
Yeah, that would've been
the perfect place to do it.

01:42:52.824 --> 01:42:55.681
Yeah, yeah, right at
the end of that speech.

01:42:58.158 --> 01:42:59.601
Now she's passed out.

01:43:00.618 --> 01:43:02.061
It's true what they say.

01:43:02.958 --> 01:43:05.451
Timing really is everything.

01:43:06.548 --> 01:43:08.081
Oh, the ambulance is here.

01:43:09.358 --> 01:43:11.116
Yay.

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:12.021
Evan won't die.

01:43:13.818 --> 01:43:16.376
Can I ride with her to the hospital?

01:43:16.378 --> 01:43:18.711
I should probably get my stomach pumped.

01:43:19.978 --> 01:43:20.917
Can I take out the knife now?

01:43:20.919 --> 01:43:21.836
No!

01:43:29.368 --> 01:43:30.526
Where's your coffee machine?

01:43:30.528 --> 01:43:33.261
Does anyone want some coffee?

01:43:47.864 --> 01:43:49.256
Bye, losers.

01:43:49.258 --> 01:43:50.461
Good to see you.

01:43:58.168 --> 01:43:59.936
How's the shoulder?

01:43:59.938 --> 01:44:00.896
Still sore?

01:44:00.898 --> 01:44:02.366
Nothing that copious amounts of alcohol

01:44:02.368 --> 01:44:03.518
and Vicodin can't cure.

01:44:05.608 --> 01:44:06.441
Same old Evan.

01:44:07.856 --> 01:44:09.351
I quit my father's campaign.

01:44:11.758 --> 01:44:13.258
When were you gonna tell me?

01:44:14.128 --> 01:44:16.978
When I finally mustered
the ability to say

01:44:19.138 --> 01:44:20.031
you were right.

01:44:23.118 --> 01:44:23.949
You remember when I told you

01:44:23.951 --> 01:44:27.003
about not liking not being good at things

01:44:27.005 --> 01:44:28.655
like making coffee and saying I'm sorry?

01:44:31.781 --> 01:44:35.864
But as for the coffee, I
came up with a solution.

01:44:37.388 --> 01:44:39.008
Instant coffee.

01:44:52.332 --> 01:44:53.165
Bridget,

01:44:57.018 --> 01:44:57.851
I'm sorry.

01:45:13.608 --> 01:45:14.441
Evan,

01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:19.743
this is oatmeal.

01:45:21.730 --> 01:45:22.563
What?

01:45:25.383 --> 01:45:27.230
You made me oatmeal.

01:45:28.223 --> 01:45:30.124
This is instant oatmeal.

01:45:48.458 --> 01:45:50.875
I'll never stop loving you.

01:45:53.375 --> 01:45:54.208
Ditto.

01:45:59.237 --> 01:46:02.920
Things are looking up for me.

01:46:04.357 --> 01:46:07.257
I got promoted from writing
engagement announcements

01:46:08.138 --> 01:46:09.238
to writing obituaries.

01:46:10.267 --> 01:46:12.105
That's super.

01:46:12.107 --> 01:46:13.865
That's like the best news ever.

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:14.700
So great.

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:20.085
So, tell me more about
the newspaper, please.

01:46:20.087 --> 01:46:21.137
Where's Trista?

01:46:21.139 --> 01:46:23.735
Dov, come over here.

01:46:23.737 --> 01:46:26.145
Oh my God, this conversation has to end.

01:46:26.147 --> 01:46:28.251
So much suck.

01:46:34.887 --> 01:46:36.665
So, I couldn't help but notice

01:46:36.667 --> 01:46:39.820
you to have been avoiding
each other all night.

01:46:41.577 --> 01:46:42.772
My parents pulled the same act for years.

01:46:42.774 --> 01:46:46.305
You're taking a position
at a museum in Romania.

01:46:46.307 --> 01:46:47.803
Seems like you're the
one going to extremes

01:46:47.805 --> 01:46:49.305
to avoid conflict.

01:46:51.752 --> 01:46:52.585
True.

01:46:54.486 --> 01:46:56.579
But I am confused.

01:46:57.896 --> 01:46:58.979
I love you both.

01:47:03.377 --> 01:47:04.727
But I need time for myself.

01:47:06.836 --> 01:47:07.669
Cliche?

01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:10.123
A little.

01:47:15.186 --> 01:47:16.708
So,

01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:17.543
friends?

01:47:18.984 --> 01:47:19.817
Eh.

01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:21.791
Okay.

01:47:21.793 --> 01:47:22.624
Fine.

01:47:22.626 --> 01:47:24.209
Bridget?

01:47:29.688 --> 01:47:30.771
Crazy fuck!

01:47:31.799 --> 01:47:33.709
Republican bitch!

01:47:33.711 --> 01:47:35.809
Jesus Christ.

01:47:42.116 --> 01:47:43.554
Well, fags, I'd stay

01:47:43.556 --> 01:47:46.493
but I'm afraid you'd
as me to help clean up.

01:47:46.495 --> 01:47:47.434
I'll miss you, kid.

01:47:47.436 --> 01:47:48.804
No you won't.

01:47:48.806 --> 01:47:51.449
I'll miss the excessive
drama you bring to my life.

01:47:54.226 --> 01:47:56.194
Next week, Hanukkah party, my place.

01:47:56.196 --> 01:47:58.504
I'm gonna bust out the Bong Mitzvah.

01:47:58.506 --> 01:47:59.403
Goodnight, homos.

01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:04.744
I should probably be going too.

01:48:04.746 --> 01:48:07.204
Early flight, long flight.

01:48:07.206 --> 01:48:08.114
You coming, Ry?

01:48:08.116 --> 01:48:09.504
I wish I was coming?

01:48:09.506 --> 01:48:10.744
Get it?

01:48:10.746 --> 01:48:12.024
No?

01:48:12.026 --> 01:48:13.654
No, I'm gonna stay up.

01:48:13.656 --> 01:48:14.706
I'll take her back.

01:48:15.676 --> 01:48:16.507
Okay, well,

01:48:16.509 --> 01:48:20.079
I am going to go Benadryl myself to sleep.

01:48:21.396 --> 01:48:22.254
See you in the morning.

01:48:22.256 --> 01:48:23.306
- Bye, babe.
- Yeah.

01:48:24.396 --> 01:48:27.704
- I'll walk you out.
- I'll walk you out.

01:48:27.706 --> 01:48:29.056
You did try to behead me.

01:48:33.826 --> 01:48:36.114
I'll see you in half a year.

01:48:36.116 --> 01:48:38.299
Just try to stay out of trouble.

01:48:39.155 --> 01:48:44.155
What's the fun in that?

01:49:13.319 --> 01:49:15.693
I know you have something to say.

01:49:15.695 --> 01:49:16.708
Cheeky monkey.

01:49:21.518 --> 01:49:24.185
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

01:49:32.135 --> 01:49:34.773
So not to sound arrogant
or anything, you know,

01:49:34.775 --> 01:49:37.788
but I am gonna be gone for six months.

01:49:39.225 --> 01:49:40.308
What I'm saying is,

01:49:41.475 --> 01:49:42.808
if you meet someone.

01:49:44.655 --> 01:49:45.842
No, I get it.

01:49:48.545 --> 01:49:49.738
I packed your poem.

01:49:50.735 --> 01:49:51.685
It's in my carryon.

01:49:55.282 --> 01:49:57.252
"Ice-kissed frost fire."

01:50:00.675 --> 01:50:02.065
I wish I could be like you

01:50:03.547 --> 01:50:05.348
and have the right words.

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:13.015
I wish I had the right words right now.

01:51:07.591 --> 01:51:09.662
So I have this friend

01:51:09.664 --> 01:51:12.424
and she really liked her
best friend's girlfriend

01:51:13.264 --> 01:51:15.152
and she thought she'd be a much better fit

01:51:15.154 --> 01:51:17.922
for her friend's girlfriends

01:51:17.924 --> 01:51:19.564
than her friend

01:51:20.414 --> 01:51:23.262
and so she set into motion

01:51:23.264 --> 01:51:27.714
a series of events that would
lead to them breaking up

01:51:29.089 --> 01:51:32.412
and it took a really long time

01:51:32.414 --> 01:51:37.122
and a lot of really manipulative behavior

01:51:37.124 --> 01:51:39.707
but eventually this girl's plan worked.

01:51:40.824 --> 01:51:42.002
What happened?

01:51:42.004 --> 01:51:42.918
What do you mean?

01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.002
What happened?

01:51:44.004 --> 01:51:45.142
What do you mean?

01:51:45.144 --> 01:51:48.162
Did your friend end up with
her best friend's girlfriend?

01:51:48.164 --> 01:51:49.452
I don't know.

01:51:49.454 --> 01:51:51.227
That remains to be seen.

01:51:53.184 --> 01:51:54.017
So,

01:51:55.944 --> 01:51:58.202
what do you think of all that?

01:51:58.204 --> 01:52:00.867
Do you think my friend is a bad person?

01:52:23.824 --> 01:52:24.657
What?

01:52:26.184 --> 01:52:27.533
Survival of the fittest, right?

01:52:29.404 --> 01:52:31.062
Yeah.

01:52:31.064 --> 01:52:31.897
Totally.

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:29.011
Is there someplace you'd rather be?

01:53:29.013 --> 01:53:30.063
Than here with you?

01:53:31.483 --> 01:53:32.316
Never.

01:53:48.352 --> 01:53:50.019
Why'd you do that?

01:53:51.059 --> 01:53:54.288
Because I knew you wouldn't.

01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:56.486
I imagine you want to
get back at your father.

01:53:58.423 --> 01:54:00.596
I would excel in that capacity.

01:54:45.144 --> 01:54:46.641
Do you love me?

01:54:46.643 --> 01:54:49.906
I know you'll say yes and I'll
take you at your word but I...

01:54:49.908 --> 01:54:51.816
With every beat of my wasted heart.

01:54:53.215 --> 01:54:56.104
I see it now, it's true.

01:54:56.106 --> 01:54:56.939
Yes.

01:59:11.049 --> 01:59:13.716
I'm laughing already, I can't.

01:59:16.770 --> 01:59:18.377
Turn around, Mike!

01:59:20.295 --> 01:59:22.176
I think but I can see.

01:59:22.178 --> 01:59:25.508
It looks like you're just crazy.

01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:27.078
Sweet prince

01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:28.438
and flights of angels.

01:59:31.730 --> 01:59:33.333
Welcome to Girl-Girl Scene.

01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:36.906
I just want to make
sure I'm holding it right.

01:59:44.150 --> 01:59:46.238
- You're up late.
- Thanks.

01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:48.288
My mom's freaking
out about the body slam.

01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:49.640
I know we're being careful.

02:00:00.294 --> 02:00:01.127
Fuck!

02:00:19.773 --> 02:00:22.194
As long as you literally
don't see my ass.

02:00:22.196 --> 02:00:23.143
My ass is out.

02:00:46.771 --> 02:00:47.602
What? Let me see.

02:00:47.604 --> 02:00:49.149
I was just filming Jerry.

02:00:52.994 --> 02:00:55.262
We got the tools and we got the knowhow.

02:00:56.199 --> 02:00:58.247
Okay, what was the next scene?

02:00:58.249 --> 02:00:59.457
Bedroom.

02:00:59.459 --> 02:01:00.290
Me waking up.

02:01:01.206 --> 02:01:02.657
I got it too late.

02:01:02.659 --> 02:01:05.099
Like I couldn't debut it
earlier in a different scene

02:01:05.101 --> 02:01:06.956
but now it's in the movie.

02:01:51.087 --> 02:01:52.337
Action.

02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:59.702
You're still here?

02:02:01.799 --> 02:02:03.182
It's over.

02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:06.022
Go home?

02:02:12.539 --> 02:02:13.372
Shoo.

02:02:13.374 --> 02:02:14.437
