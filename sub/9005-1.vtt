00:56.440 --> 00:59.485
Welcome to the California Gold Coast!

00:59.694 --> 01:03.197
A magical land where
the sun always shines

01:03.740 --> 01:05.700
and the surf always rolls.

01:06.034 --> 01:09.871
A place where a million dollars
might buy ya a view-

01:10.288 --> 01:11.665
of another guy's view.

01:11.873 --> 01:13.625
Once upon a time-

01:13.958 --> 01:17.503
this was the home
of the legendary Bobby Z.

01:19.172 --> 01:20.757
You see that out there, folks?

01:21.049 --> 01:23.635
That's Bobby Z's territory, my friends.

01:23.968 --> 01:25.094
He ruled those waters.

01:25.428 --> 01:26.554
He was Poseidon.

01:26.805 --> 01:28.347
He was Neptune.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.642
His heart beat with
the rhythm of those waves.

01:31.059 --> 01:32.644
And when the sun set,

01:32.936 --> 01:36.815
Z blessed this land
with the most amazing-

01:38.357 --> 01:40.443
weed known to man.

01:41.152 --> 01:45.323
In those days, if 5 yuppies smoked a bowl
after their poached salmon-

01:45.865 --> 01:49.744
well, it was Z's weed, guaranteed.

01:51.287 --> 01:52.538
Z's gone now.

01:52.831 --> 01:55.249
6 years, maybe more.

01:55.458 --> 01:56.835
Some say he's in Europe.

01:57.251 --> 02:00.046
Some say even Thailand, maybe Japan.

02:00.463 --> 02:04.425
The doubters, the non-believers say
they all of course, he's dead.

02:04.926 --> 02:07.762
But he's coming back. I know it.

02:08.179 --> 02:09.764
Water is life.

02:10.056 --> 02:13.685
From it he sprang
and to it he shall return.

02:14.102 --> 02:17.271
Bobby Z is gonna be rebirthed.

02:17.689 --> 02:21.943
Bobby Z is gonna be resurrected.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.945
He's coming back.

02:24.237 --> 02:29.868
The great Bobby Z is coming back.

02:35.915 --> 02:36.958
This guy's perfect.

02:37.166 --> 02:40.294
His name is Tim Kearney,
three-time loser from Palmdale.

02:41.337 --> 02:43.131
There's definitely a resemblance.

02:44.966 --> 02:45.800
Family?

02:46.009 --> 02:47.301
Mom's dead, dad split.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.552
Hm

02:49.262 --> 02:50.847
Uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters?

02:51.222 --> 02:54.350
Tim's an only child
on his own since he was 15.

02:55.018 --> 02:57.103
First gets busted when he was a kid
for breaking and entering-

02:57.395 --> 02:59.272
when he trips over a lawn sprinkler
on the way out the door-

02:59.563 --> 03:00.815
carrying his stash.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.359
Goes to juvie, comes out, does it again.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.945
Right? This time, he gets a court-mandated
stint in the Marines.

03:06.237 --> 03:07.822
Gets his ass sent to Iraq.

03:08.031 --> 03:09.490
All right? Well, he wins the Navy cross,

03:09.699 --> 03:11.159
and then gets a dishonorable discharge.

03:11.367 --> 03:12.410
For what?

03:12.744 --> 03:13.870
Beating up an Iraqi colonel.

03:14.078 --> 03:15.747
Should have given him a medal.

03:16.790 --> 03:17.832
So he comes back to the States,

03:18.166 --> 03:19.709
where he commits assault
and battery, strong-arm,

03:20.001 --> 03:21.377
on a convenience store clerk,

03:21.669 --> 03:23.337
for raising the price on an ice cream bar.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.757
- I thought it was eighty-five cents
- $1.15

03:27.633 --> 03:28.592
Strike one.

03:29.093 --> 03:30.678
And now, get this. He gets paroled. Right?

03:30.970 --> 03:32.430
His dipshit buddy, Wayne, picks him up.

03:32.847 --> 03:34.432
On the way home, they stop at a gas station.

03:34.598 --> 03:36.517
Tim's waiting in the car, Wayne goes in.

03:36.810 --> 03:37.852
Okay? Here's the beaut.

03:38.186 --> 03:39.729
Wayne robs the gas station.

03:39.938 --> 03:40.688
Tim takes the rap.

03:40.772 --> 03:42.231
Open the door! Open the door!

03:42.648 --> 03:43.691
Go! Oh, shit, there's a cop!

03:43.900 --> 03:44.317
There's a cop!

03:44.525 --> 03:45.985
Open the door! Go, man!

03:46.277 --> 03:47.361
Strike two.

03:48.071 --> 03:51.199
Which leads us to
our dead biker friend, Mad Dog.

03:53.617 --> 03:55.453
Been here six months now, boy.

03:55.787 --> 03:57.663
You need protection and we're it.

03:57.872 --> 03:59.040
- Just wanna do my time, man.

03:59.332 --> 04:01.125
- Don't work like that, soldier boy.

06:15.593 --> 06:16.760
Strike three.

06:18.012 --> 06:19.263
Heartbreaking.

06:19.472 --> 06:20.431
Yeah.

06:20.848 --> 06:21.765
Yeah, he's fucked.

06:22.934 --> 06:25.603
The Brotherhood will get him no matter
what prison yard he ends up on.

06:26.020 --> 06:29.273
Shit, Brotherhood will kill you no matter
where you end up, period.

06:37.115 --> 06:39.783
How'd you get to be
such a loser, convict, hm?

06:40.201 --> 06:42.954
Uh, what is it, low self-esteem?

06:43.371 --> 06:45.039
Lack of impulse control?

06:45.331 --> 06:47.000
Man, I can't remember what they decided.

06:47.291 --> 06:50.128
Well I see you had a lot of practice
from your file here.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.587
Yeah.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.131
You know why you're here?

06:53.464 --> 06:55.466
Probably 'cause you want me
to roll over on somebody, right?

06:55.883 --> 06:58.386
Wrong. We don't want you
to roll over on somebody.

06:59.303 --> 07:00.638
We want you to be somebody.

07:00.972 --> 07:02.974
That's what my mom used to say.

07:06.394 --> 07:08.479
Why don't you stop fooling around?

07:08.812 --> 07:10.898
And maybe, just maybe,
if you do like I say do-

07:11.190 --> 07:12.858
you can walk away from here
and keep walking.

07:13.151 --> 07:15.069
Would you like that, convict?

07:16.320 --> 07:17.155
Good.

07:20.241 --> 07:21.409
Look at him.

07:23.077 --> 07:24.120
Look at him!

07:25.163 --> 07:26.330
Who does he look like?

07:29.333 --> 07:30.793
- Does he look like anybody you know?

07:31.085 --> 07:32.461
- Well, he kinda looks like me.

07:33.421 --> 07:34.672
You know who that is?

07:34.964 --> 07:37.175
That is Bobby Z.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.343
Robert James Zacharias, man.

07:39.552 --> 07:40.594
He grew up in Laguna Beach.

07:40.803 --> 07:42.346
While you were shitting
your life down the toilet,

07:42.596 --> 07:43.722
he was The Dude.

07:44.015 --> 07:45.391
- The Man.
- Oh, he had it all, man.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.185
The hottest women, the finest clothes,

07:47.476 --> 07:48.311
the best dope.

07:48.436 --> 07:50.104
He was living the life, man.

07:50.271 --> 07:51.439
But he had another talent.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.567
See, Bobby was also
a very accomplished drug dealer.

07:54.858 --> 07:56.777
Matter of fact, he was a legend at 16.

07:57.070 --> 07:58.862
Couldn't even get a driver's license.

07:59.030 --> 08:02.283
He hitchhiked to
and from his first weed buy.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.203
Two Nike bags, 8 keys of Maui Wowee.

08:05.536 --> 08:09.790
Z turns two gym bags into four,
four into 16, 16 into 32.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.959
Unlike you, convict,
he figures it all out.

08:12.293 --> 08:13.961
'Cause he never puts
his own ass on the line.

08:14.295 --> 08:16.464
But he's getting some unwanted
attention, not from the cops

08:16.797 --> 08:18.049
but from some other

08:18.216 --> 08:20.134
businessmen, some rivals.

08:20.426 --> 08:21.969
Two of his best runners end up face-down

08:22.303 --> 08:24.388
in a drainage ditch
out there in Riverside.

08:24.722 --> 08:26.057
So what does Z do?

08:26.474 --> 08:27.808
He disappears

08:28.059 --> 08:30.144
like morning mist.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.813
Now the dope still keeps coming.

08:33.147 --> 08:34.398
And we're wondering how.

08:34.607 --> 08:34.898
Turns out

08:35.149 --> 08:37.525
Bobby Z's got a marketing system.

08:37.943 --> 08:38.902
Yeah, it's genius.

08:39.070 --> 08:40.988
Cutouts, bonuses, agents.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.323
Profit-sharing.

08:42.530 --> 08:43.657
All kinds of shit.

08:43.907 --> 08:47.536
I mean he's bringing in boatloads of
the best weed from all over the world.

08:48.079 --> 08:49.622
Bringing it in electronically,

08:49.913 --> 08:51.499
running his empire from afar,

08:51.707 --> 08:55.336
like he's a goddamn
wizard of weed or some shit.

09:00.591 --> 09:01.842
So, what do you want me to do?

09:03.386 --> 09:04.637
Don Huertero.

09:04.928 --> 09:06.514
Biggest drug dealer in Northern Mexico.

09:06.722 --> 09:09.517
Runs Tijuana, runs Baja, runs San Diego.

09:09.933 --> 09:12.686
He wants to partner up with Bobby Z
and start marching north-

09:12.978 --> 09:13.937
to Los Angeles.

09:14.230 --> 09:18.192
Now, this Don Huertero
is holding a man in Mexico.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.199
His name is Art Moreno.
He's my partner.

09:25.408 --> 09:27.034
He's a good man. He's got five kids,

09:27.368 --> 09:28.411
and I'm godfather to all of them.

09:28.536 --> 09:30.621
I'd like my partner to see
my partner come home alive.

09:30.913 --> 09:33.416
Don Huertero has agreed
to make an exchange,

09:33.832 --> 09:35.084
Art Moreno for Bobby Z,

09:35.293 --> 09:36.877
but only for Bobby Z.

09:37.170 --> 09:37.920
- So why don't you find him?

09:38.003 --> 09:39.046
- We had him.

09:39.380 --> 09:41.632
Turned himself in, in the embassy
in Thailand, sick as a dog.

09:42.091 --> 09:43.426
Got bit by some Asian bug.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.760
Walks into the embassy,

09:44.968 --> 09:46.970
says his name is Robert James Zacharias,

09:47.305 --> 09:48.139
says he's dying,

09:48.431 --> 09:49.973
says he needs to speak with somebody.

09:50.224 --> 09:51.975
so I'm on a plane pronto.

09:52.310 --> 09:53.311
But I'm too late.

09:54.145 --> 09:55.313
Kaboom, heart attack.

09:55.521 --> 09:57.481
Drops dead right there in the embassy.

09:57.815 --> 09:59.150
God damn bug killed him.

09:59.358 --> 10:00.234
So listen up.

10:00.401 --> 10:01.068
This is where you come in.

10:01.235 --> 10:01.985
Look,

10:02.069 --> 10:04.405
Don Huertero's got
no sense of humor about this shit.

10:04.822 --> 10:06.657
If he finds out
that the real Z is dead,

10:06.990 --> 10:08.326
he'll kill my partner.

10:08.659 --> 10:09.493
Dead for dead.

10:09.577 --> 10:11.370
You pretend to be Z.

10:12.413 --> 10:14.165
We make a trade with you at the border,

10:14.498 --> 10:16.250
and if you walk away, well,

10:16.584 --> 10:18.127
you walk away.

10:19.628 --> 10:21.088
Man, the second I walk in there,

10:21.380 --> 10:23.882
Don Huertero's gonna know
I'm not Bobby Z.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.594
Huertero and Z have never met.
It's up to you.

10:27.010 --> 10:29.180
You take your chances on the border,
pretending to be Bobby Z,

10:29.513 --> 10:32.641
or we leave you here
at the Hotel California.

10:41.066 --> 10:41.609
- Perfect.

10:41.817 --> 10:43.068
- I'll be damned.

10:44.027 --> 10:45.238
Tell me how you got that scar again.

10:45.571 --> 10:46.280
- I-

10:46.530 --> 10:48.073
I-

10:48.282 --> 10:51.202
I was surfing and my head bounced
off a rock when I wiped out.

10:51.619 --> 10:51.952
- Where?

10:52.119 --> 10:53.496
- Uh, Three Arch Bay.

10:53.704 --> 10:55.581
- What kind of car do you drive?
- A '66 Mustang.

10:55.873 --> 10:56.957
- Favorite color?
- Yellow.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.917
- Favorite football team?
- He hates football.

10:59.252 --> 10:59.960
- I hate football.

11:00.294 --> 11:01.337
- I hate football.

11:01.545 --> 11:02.463
Favorite meal?

11:03.297 --> 11:04.131
Uh--

11:04.340 --> 11:05.508
Come on! Vegetarian chili.

11:05.716 --> 11:08.093
How many times we gotta go over this?

11:14.350 --> 11:15.601
Lunch time, Z.

11:17.144 --> 11:17.686
- Chew up.
- Oh, come on, man,

11:17.811 --> 11:18.521
- can I get some real food,

11:18.729 --> 11:19.897
- ...like a cheeseburger or something?

11:20.105 --> 11:22.566
- No. Z was a vegetarian.

11:24.652 --> 11:25.819
And a leftie.

11:36.872 --> 11:38.332
You make one mistake
like that with Don Huertero,

11:38.666 --> 11:40.083
you're a dead man, okay?

11:50.219 --> 11:51.053
- Remember her?

11:51.679 --> 11:52.430
- That's Audrey.
No.

11:52.513 --> 11:53.681
Not Audrey, Olivia!

11:53.972 --> 11:55.766
Olivia!

11:59.186 --> 12:00.020
Elizabeth.

12:00.103 --> 12:01.355
Oh, yeah, you remember her name,

12:01.689 --> 12:02.856
don't you?

12:04.608 --> 12:05.943
How long was I with her for?

12:08.153 --> 12:09.196
I don't know.

12:10.113 --> 12:11.699
I thought you guys knew everything.

12:18.289 --> 12:20.123
Why would I wanna be with anybody else?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.295
Shut up and get up.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.127
Hey, one last thing.

13:47.545 --> 13:48.879
If Huertero mentions the Monk,

13:49.212 --> 13:50.631
he was your chief of operations.

13:51.048 --> 13:51.715
The Monk?

13:51.799 --> 13:52.633
You're just telling me about this now?

13:52.841 --> 13:53.384
- They won't ask you.

13:53.551 --> 13:55.469
Well in case it comes up,
you should know.

13:55.761 --> 13:56.804
You guys went to high school together.

13:57.012 --> 13:58.889
The Monk went to Notre Dame,
then joined the Franciscan Order.

13:59.222 --> 14:00.891
He has some serious math skills.

14:01.183 --> 14:03.060
Started putting
the monastery's books on Quicken.

14:03.268 --> 14:04.520
Fell in love with the internet.

14:04.645 --> 14:06.063
Discovered he loved it
more than he loved God.

14:06.397 --> 14:07.230
So he quits the church,

14:07.440 --> 14:09.232
and helps you
make your business electronic.

14:10.568 --> 14:12.986
Without The Monk, Z wouldn't be Z.

14:13.404 --> 14:15.781
Here's uh, The Monk's number
and address, in case you need it.

14:17.157 --> 14:17.991
You got- you got another vest for me?

14:18.158 --> 14:20.494
Hey, you just relax.
you stand over there for a minute.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.625
I sent that recommendation
for your promotion upstairs, Escobar.

14:26.917 --> 14:28.836
- I'm gonna get your partner
back for you, sir.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.253
- I appreciate it.

15:52.670 --> 15:53.671
Let's go.

16:16.860 --> 16:17.778
Good luck.

16:36.046 --> 16:36.964
Okay, cowboy.

17:17.420 --> 17:18.171
Don't shoot!

17:19.172 --> 17:20.257
Don't shoot!

17:42.237 --> 17:42.946
Don't move.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.365
Oh, dear god, don't shoot.

17:45.699 --> 17:47.367
- I'm here for the exchange!

17:47.534 --> 17:49.119
I'm supposed to exchange-

17:49.327 --> 17:50.788
God damn it!

17:51.121 --> 17:52.956
Shut up!

17:53.290 --> 17:54.124
Let me go!
Get up!

17:54.207 --> 17:56.293
Clear the tracks! Move!

19:15.956 --> 19:17.124
Señor Z?

19:19.209 --> 19:20.252
That's me.

19:57.164 --> 19:58.081
Mr. Z.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.500
Mr. Z.

20:03.211 --> 20:03.754
Huh?

20:03.921 --> 20:05.088
I brought you clothes.

20:05.422 --> 20:06.548
The bathroom's right there.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.091
You can, uh, shave.

20:08.425 --> 20:10.427
I brought you a new toothbrush.

20:51.051 --> 20:52.010
Gracias.

21:35.262 --> 21:36.346
Mr. Z?

21:36.429 --> 21:38.723
Mr. Z? Hi.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.018
Mr. Brian would like
to see you right now,

21:41.351 --> 21:42.477
if it's convenient.

21:50.819 --> 21:52.195
- Come on.
- Sure.

21:56.950 --> 21:57.700
Hey,

21:58.535 --> 22:00.120
The legend that is Bobby Z.

22:00.537 --> 22:02.080
Well, it's an honor, my friend.

22:02.497 --> 22:04.041
- Brian. Brian Cervier.

22:04.374 --> 22:05.417
- Good to see you.

22:05.542 --> 22:07.085
Well welcome to my humble abode.

22:07.836 --> 22:08.879
Get him a glass of wine.

22:09.587 --> 22:11.131
Squeezed from my own grapes.

22:12.382 --> 22:13.633
Don Huertero apologizes for uh,

22:13.884 --> 22:15.635
not being here to greet
you personally, but um,

22:15.844 --> 22:17.637
he'll be up on the weekend, so

22:17.930 --> 22:19.306
until then you just

22:19.597 --> 22:22.600
chill and enjoy the oasis.

22:22.935 --> 22:23.977
Bobby Z.

22:27.647 --> 22:28.857
Bobby Z!

22:30.150 --> 22:31.568
At my hacienda.

22:31.902 --> 22:33.153
Who'd have thought?

22:35.447 --> 22:37.199
A hundred acres of vineyards,

22:37.532 --> 22:39.617
dating back to the 1500s.

22:41.203 --> 22:43.788
So, what happened out there last night?

22:44.206 --> 22:46.583
Cop started shooting,
man, so I hit the dirt.

22:46.917 --> 22:48.585
It's a dangerous place, the border.

22:48.793 --> 22:49.836
Get some towels.

22:50.045 --> 22:51.296
So, what are your plans?

22:52.005 --> 22:54.632
- Uh, man, I don't make plans. Just uh-

22:55.050 --> 22:56.093
- Really?

22:56.426 --> 22:59.096
I'm only asking because Don Huertero
has a proposition for you.

22:59.429 --> 23:01.181
A serious one.

23:01.598 --> 23:04.767
Well, then uh, I'll talk about
that with the don when he gets here.

23:05.894 --> 23:07.562
- Well, I won't take that as an insult.

23:07.854 --> 23:08.688
- Don't.

23:11.733 --> 23:13.693
And now, this is a beauty.

23:14.027 --> 23:15.695
A horse in England called Great Run,

23:16.029 --> 23:17.572
won The National a couple of times.

23:17.780 --> 23:19.532
And this, this is its foal.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.369
Unfortunately, it broke its leg.

23:22.785 --> 23:24.662
Fuckin' useless and I haven't
got the heart to shoot it.

23:24.955 --> 23:28.208
This is my most valuable product.

23:29.376 --> 23:30.293
You got connections in Thailand, right?

23:30.627 --> 23:31.461
Come here.

23:32.170 --> 23:34.047
Thais, I get a lot of money for Thais.

23:35.632 --> 23:38.135
Give ya a massage and then cook you
a nice green chicken curry afterwards.

23:39.136 --> 23:41.346
Hurry up.
Hey, hey, what you doing? Dumbo,

23:41.638 --> 23:42.805
don't bruise the fruit.

23:43.140 --> 23:43.974
It's a product.

23:44.057 --> 23:45.392
If you bruise it,
then no one will want it.

23:45.642 --> 23:46.559
Okay?

23:47.894 --> 23:50.522
Bill, just get your men
in order, will you?

23:50.730 --> 23:51.898
You give me some decent money
to pay for help,

23:52.065 --> 23:54.567
I wouldn't have morons working for me.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.491
Right. So.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.326
Massage parlor.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.702
Massage parlor.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.371
Massage parlor.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.040
You, massage parlor.

24:08.248 --> 24:11.584
These ugly ones over here,
send them to the sweat shop.

24:13.253 --> 24:15.422
And this, this is Bobby Z.

24:27.517 --> 24:28.351
- Pleasure.

24:28.685 --> 24:29.519
- Likewise.

24:30.853 --> 24:32.105
Used to herd cattle.

24:39.446 --> 24:40.572
Jules, wait a minute.

24:47.245 --> 24:48.288
Who are these people?

24:48.621 --> 24:51.291
Oh you know, Eurotrash, crazy Russians,

24:51.624 --> 24:53.918
friends from the import-export business.

24:54.336 --> 24:55.878
And of course the lovely Elizabeth.

24:56.296 --> 24:57.672
I trust you slept well?

24:57.964 --> 24:59.632
- Yeah.
- And alone.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.431
Is that uh, is that her boy?

25:07.390 --> 25:09.226
Oh no, that's Olivia's beautiful,

25:09.559 --> 25:10.727
beautiful boy.

25:14.064 --> 25:15.065
- Where is Olivia?

25:15.815 --> 25:16.983
- She's at Betty Ford.

25:17.150 --> 25:18.526
This time for speed.

25:18.735 --> 25:20.487
She asked Elizabeth
to look after the kid

25:20.903 --> 25:22.405
six months ago.

25:26.993 --> 25:27.910
Sir Brian.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.496
Mm.

25:30.747 --> 25:31.873
Your gear.

25:33.958 --> 25:35.627
Wherever two or more
are gathered in my name-

25:41.591 --> 25:42.425
Shut up.

25:44.177 --> 25:45.220
Oleg.

25:45.428 --> 25:47.180
Oleg. Come on.

25:47.514 --> 25:49.099
Mind your own business, bitch.

26:16.501 --> 26:17.460
Bobby!

26:18.711 --> 26:19.962
He's gonna be dead in a minute.

26:52.162 --> 26:52.662
- Hi.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.331
- Hey.

27:00.587 --> 27:01.546
You know Bobby, I have never seen you

27:01.671 --> 27:04.341
stick up for anyone but yourself before.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.927
I have to admit, the kid
was pretty impressed, too.

27:09.679 --> 27:11.139
- I don't know much about kids.

27:11.431 --> 27:12.599
- That's too bad

27:12.932 --> 27:13.933
-...because he's yours.

28:19.749 --> 28:21.834
Big, bad Boom Boom.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.337
- How's the meth business?

28:25.171 --> 28:26.756
- This is my business.

28:26.923 --> 28:27.674
Maybe you didn't see
the sign on your way in.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.967
I'm a tattoo artist.

28:30.260 --> 28:31.636
(speaks Spanish)

28:32.178 --> 28:33.095
Easy, baby.

28:34.264 --> 28:35.598
Don't go nowhere.

28:35.932 --> 28:37.684
I'm not gonna bite you.

28:38.518 --> 28:39.852
I got a tip for ya.

28:41.771 --> 28:43.523
About the guy that did Mad Dog.

28:45.525 --> 28:46.234
Tim Kearney.

28:46.359 --> 28:48.194
Mm-hm. Yeah

28:48.611 --> 28:49.987
You and your brothers
been looking for him,

28:50.196 --> 28:51.531
but you can't find him, can ya?.

28:54.158 --> 28:55.201
He'll turn up

28:55.535 --> 28:57.370
Feds still got him in protective custody.

28:57.704 --> 28:58.871
Oh, no.

28:59.038 --> 28:59.997
He's out.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.377
If I was you, I'd
start looking down around the border.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.463
Excuse me?

29:07.088 --> 29:09.048
What's your play in this?

29:10.007 --> 29:11.468
Oh, didn't I tell ya?

29:12.927 --> 29:14.804
I'm the one that turned him loose.

29:21.143 --> 29:22.645
I could do a car bomb,

29:23.229 --> 29:26.065
take your legs off, right at the knees.

29:27.817 --> 29:29.068
I bet you could.

29:33.365 --> 29:35.575
Just 'cause we doin' business
don't mean you got rights.

29:35.867 --> 29:38.244
Come on. Come on, please.

29:38.995 --> 29:40.663
What the hell do you want, Gruz?

29:40.872 --> 29:43.916
Let's just say Kearney being released
is a case of misplaced trust.

29:45.167 --> 29:47.962
Drop him off in a body bag,
I'll pretend it was Santa Claus,

29:48.505 --> 29:49.756
and that'll be that.

29:50.757 --> 29:51.841
Adios.

30:42.892 --> 30:43.976
So the boy's mine?

30:46.062 --> 30:47.063
That's right.

30:48.731 --> 30:49.982
She never told me about him.

30:51.484 --> 30:53.570
Yeah. Well you'd have
to be around for that.

31:05.540 --> 31:06.666
So does everybody know?

31:06.999 --> 31:08.167
Hm-mm

31:08.334 --> 31:10.002
Just Olivia and me.

31:10.420 --> 31:11.253
Now you.

31:12.755 --> 31:14.298
Olivia asked me not to tell you.

31:16.801 --> 31:17.844
- So why did ya?

31:18.761 --> 31:19.721
- 'Cause you should know.

31:22.932 --> 31:24.726
It's been a long time, Bobby.

31:26.686 --> 31:28.187
- Yeah, too long.

31:28.354 --> 31:29.188
- Yeah.

31:31.273 --> 31:32.650
So what brought you back?

31:35.361 --> 31:36.404
Was it the money?

31:38.698 --> 31:39.949
Still want my share?

31:42.243 --> 31:43.786
I hadn't forgotten about you.

31:44.036 --> 31:44.954
Mm

31:46.414 --> 31:47.790
You're giving me what's mine?

31:50.292 --> 31:51.419
Yeah, of course.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.469
You really have changed, Bobby.

32:01.721 --> 32:02.555
How?

32:05.182 --> 32:07.143
Well, in the old days,

32:09.061 --> 32:11.230
you would've definitely
had me in bed by now.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.658
Let's do it my way.

32:21.866 --> 32:24.368
You haven't forgotten
my favorite position, have you?

32:32.835 --> 32:34.086
- No.
- No?

32:51.688 --> 32:53.272
Do you remember our first time?

32:55.232 --> 32:57.860
In my little trailer at El Morro Beach?

33:00.863 --> 33:02.740
It's still there, if you need it.

33:08.287 --> 33:09.413
Thanks.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.208
Noncommittal as ever.

33:24.220 --> 33:25.262
Was I bad to you?

33:32.228 --> 33:34.021
Yeah. Yeah Bobby, you were.

33:38.067 --> 33:39.652
Have you talked to Monk lately?

33:42.780 --> 33:43.615
No.

33:44.574 --> 33:45.575
You?

33:46.743 --> 33:47.785
Once in a while.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.412
He still dreams of having me someday.

33:51.748 --> 33:53.833
So long as that dream
is alive I'll get what I want.

33:56.544 --> 33:57.670
You need his number?

34:01.423 --> 34:02.592
No, I have it.

34:10.933 --> 34:12.101
You better get going.

34:14.061 --> 34:15.103
Why?

34:17.398 --> 34:19.692
'Cause when Don Huertero gets here
he's gonna kill you.

34:23.237 --> 34:24.280
How do you know that?

34:26.364 --> 34:27.408
You know Brian.

34:27.617 --> 34:29.201
Yap, yap, yap.

34:55.978 --> 34:57.313
Can I come with you? Please?

34:59.523 --> 35:00.357
- Listen.
- Please?

35:00.566 --> 35:01.400
- Look, go back in your bedroom.

35:01.609 --> 35:03.277
- Please. Can I come with you?

35:04.111 --> 35:05.362
- Hey, I don't know much about kids.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.323
- That's too bad, 'cause he's yours.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.116
Beautiful, beautiful boy.

35:13.287 --> 35:14.413
Where do you think you're going, son?

35:17.333 --> 35:18.292
I'm leaving.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.418
What, are you gonna shoot me?

35:20.086 --> 35:21.212
You're not the type.

35:36.018 --> 35:38.187
Stop him! Bring him back!

35:52.201 --> 35:52.910
Come on!

35:57.707 --> 35:58.624
He's getting away!

35:59.583 --> 36:00.710
After him!

36:08.885 --> 36:10.011
Get him! Go!

36:49.216 --> 36:51.010
Alright get off. Hide.

36:51.177 --> 36:52.344
Hah! Hah!

38:18.890 --> 38:19.849
You came back! You came back!

38:21.934 --> 38:22.935
Yeah, I'm not too bright.

38:49.879 --> 38:51.547
He's heading south
by southwest, Mr. Johnson.

38:54.216 --> 38:54.967
Let's go.

38:59.221 --> 39:00.389
H'yah, h'yah.

39:29.919 --> 39:30.752
Are we out of gas?

39:32.171 --> 39:33.339
Yeah, we're out of gas.

39:33.965 --> 39:39.220
- Son of a bitch. Alright.
- Now what?

39:41.263 --> 39:42.181
What're we gonna do?

39:43.015 --> 39:45.559
Alright. Alright,
we're gonna play a game now.

39:45.935 --> 39:46.768
What game?

39:49.730 --> 39:50.772
You know what a marine is?

39:51.065 --> 39:52.316
Kind of soldier.

39:52.524 --> 39:53.025
No.

39:53.234 --> 39:54.526
Marine is a bad ass.

39:54.693 --> 39:55.777
You wanna play that game?

39:55.987 --> 39:56.778
No.

39:57.738 --> 39:58.572
Why not?

39:58.780 --> 40:00.241
Navy SEALs are tougher.

40:05.537 --> 40:06.497
Okay.

40:06.622 --> 40:08.290
So we're gonna play Navy SEALs,

40:08.582 --> 40:10.251
and we're going on a secret mission.

40:10.584 --> 40:12.544
And we're gonna go up
over that mountain over there.

40:12.753 --> 40:13.795
That's so gay.

40:16.924 --> 40:17.758
You know the truth of the matter is, man,

40:17.967 --> 40:19.718
I don't really give a shit
what we play right now,

40:20.136 --> 40:21.803
but if we don't play something,
they're gonna shoot you-

40:22.138 --> 40:23.389
Don't scream at me.

40:23.597 --> 40:24.223
You know, forget about it

40:24.431 --> 40:25.266
Let's just go. That was stupid.

40:25.474 --> 40:26.308
Let's go, come on. Move it.

40:26.600 --> 40:27.643
What,

40:27.768 --> 40:29.145
we're gonna walk?

40:29.436 --> 40:32.564
No, I just called for a limousine, man,
it's gonna be here in 15 minutes.

40:33.899 --> 40:34.566
- Move out!

40:34.733 --> 40:35.692
- God.

40:41.532 --> 40:43.284
See, you wouldn't have made
a very good marine anyhow.

40:43.617 --> 40:44.576
Whatever.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.376
Why are you doing this to me?

40:54.878 --> 40:55.587
We were friends.

40:55.921 --> 40:56.755
You've ruined everything.

40:57.089 --> 40:59.591
You've put my job in jeopardy.

41:02.386 --> 41:03.345
- Where was Bobby going?

41:03.637 --> 41:04.805
- I don't know.

41:05.014 --> 41:07.266
You know what, I almost believe you.

41:07.599 --> 41:08.976
But Don Huertero won't.

41:09.268 --> 41:11.145
He might.

41:11.353 --> 41:12.396
You know what?

41:13.855 --> 41:14.690
He won't.

41:14.773 --> 41:15.732
And it's gonna be better for me

41:16.025 --> 41:18.235
if it looks like
I tried harder to find out.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.742
Just not my face, okay?

41:47.848 --> 41:48.599
What's that?

41:48.682 --> 41:49.933
- What?
- Listen.

41:50.226 --> 41:51.310
- What
- Shh.

41:55.772 --> 41:56.482
Can you hear it?

42:02.321 --> 42:03.572
Run! Run!

42:04.823 --> 42:05.574
I got 'em, Johnson.

42:05.782 --> 42:08.494
They're a half a mile due west
heading into Cable Rock.

42:09.245 --> 42:10.787
Come on, go! Run!

42:16.085 --> 42:16.835
Run! Run!

42:21.840 --> 42:23.008
Come on! Stop looking!

42:24.260 --> 42:25.177
Don't slow down!

42:29.848 --> 42:31.517
Go! Go! Go!

42:42.153 --> 42:43.320
They're all yours, boys.

42:43.612 --> 42:45.114
Bring him back alive.

42:45.281 --> 42:46.323
Stay out of sight.

42:52.496 --> 42:53.455
We're all right.

43:02.798 --> 43:03.757
- You miss your mom?

43:04.591 --> 43:05.301
- Yeah.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.511
But I like it better with Elizabeth.

43:08.887 --> 43:09.596
- And why's that?

43:10.306 --> 43:11.682
- She's not a drug addict.

43:17.229 --> 43:18.063
That's good.

43:19.315 --> 43:20.357
That's real good.

43:26.155 --> 43:30.033
Alright kid, I'm proud of you,
but this is go-time right now.

43:30.992 --> 43:33.078
This is serious and I need you
to listen to me, Alright?

43:34.205 --> 43:36.081
Those bad guys, they're right behind us.

43:36.373 --> 43:37.749
They're gonna be here any minute.

43:38.167 --> 43:39.835
So when they get here,
I'm gonna signal you,

43:40.169 --> 43:42.629
and I want you to hide
behind those two rocks right there.

43:42.963 --> 43:44.840
Alright, you see those rocks?

43:46.300 --> 43:47.259
Okay?

43:53.390 --> 43:56.310
There is no way some candy-ass
surfer from Laguna Beach

43:56.852 --> 43:58.520
knows his way around a desert like this.

44:08.822 --> 44:09.740
H'yah! H'yah!

44:36.141 --> 44:36.975
Shit!

44:40.229 --> 44:41.230
Get behind the rock.

44:41.480 --> 44:42.731
Hide behind that rock.

45:24.940 --> 45:26.191
I'm gonna cut you up, boy.

45:27.568 --> 45:28.485
Come on, cowboy.

45:29.110 --> 45:29.653
Come on.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.335
Shit.

46:30.506 --> 46:33.675
Come on! Go go go!
Come on, go, run! Don't look back! Come on!

46:37.929 --> 46:39.681
- I got you now, you son of a bitch
- Run!

46:41.892 --> 46:42.726
Ah, shit!

46:44.520 --> 46:45.937
Run your ass off.

46:46.271 --> 46:47.439
Come on! Come on, come on!

46:48.273 --> 46:50.108
Goddamn horse.

46:52.861 --> 46:55.447
Look, I know this looks bad,
but I can explain everything.

47:12.130 --> 47:15.258
He killed your men and escaped
even from you, Mr. Johnson.

47:17.052 --> 47:18.804
Let Brian cook in the sun for a while.

47:21.097 --> 47:22.974
Mr. Johnson, follow me.

47:25.143 --> 47:26.812
Brian is a cowardly degenerate

47:27.145 --> 47:29.731
who gallantly seeks to place
the blame on sweet Elizabeth.

47:30.148 --> 47:32.651
He tells me that she warned Mr. Z
about my plans for him.

47:33.068 --> 47:35.153
If that's true, and perhaps it is,

47:35.487 --> 47:38.490
then Brian was negligent
in sharing my plans with her.

47:38.907 --> 47:40.409
Stand up, my dear.

47:41.952 --> 47:42.994
Turn around.

47:45.288 --> 47:46.247
The robe.

47:51.336 --> 47:55.006
Elizabeth, Mr. Johnson,
was my late daughter's best friend.

47:55.424 --> 47:58.009
I've known her since
she was 16 years old.

47:58.844 --> 48:02.681
Her beauty is her blessing
and also her curse.

48:03.765 --> 48:05.183
Turn around, dear.

48:09.270 --> 48:11.272
What Brian fails to understand-

48:11.565 --> 48:14.067
is that such a woman does not fear pain.

48:14.485 --> 48:16.152
She doesn't like pain

48:16.445 --> 48:16.862
but she does not fear it.

48:16.987 --> 48:18.447
- May I put the robe back on?

48:18.780 --> 48:19.781
- Go ahead.

48:21.992 --> 48:25.120
What such a woman fears is disfigurement.

48:26.705 --> 48:28.540
Look at this face.

48:29.916 --> 48:33.253
What Elizabeth fears is to be ugly.

48:33.670 --> 48:35.881
A deep scar from here to here,

48:36.798 --> 48:40.636
perhaps with the blade
of a dull knife that no surgeon

48:41.177 --> 48:44.806
however skillful, could repair.

48:45.223 --> 48:46.808
You fear ugliness.

48:47.017 --> 48:48.560
Am I right Elizabeth?

48:49.728 --> 48:50.646
Yes.

48:56.192 --> 48:59.655
With a man such as you,
Mr. Johnson, it's simpler.

49:00.071 --> 49:00.906
You want to live.

49:01.072 --> 49:02.032
Yes.

49:03.408 --> 49:04.242
Yeah

49:04.535 --> 49:08.830
So, for your betrayal, and your failure,

49:10.666 --> 49:12.668
I sentence you to disfigurement,

49:13.001 --> 49:14.252
and you, Mr. Johnson,

49:14.545 --> 49:15.587
to death.

49:19.966 --> 49:21.927
But I suspend my sentence.

49:23.094 --> 49:24.555
You are both on parole.

49:26.347 --> 49:28.850
How do we get off parole, Don Huertero?

49:29.267 --> 49:30.519
You bring me Z,

49:30.686 --> 49:31.853
alive.

49:32.187 --> 49:33.730
You have three days.

49:39.695 --> 49:41.112
How'd his daughter die?

49:43.865 --> 49:45.283
She killed herself.

49:48.620 --> 49:49.788
Hi, fellas.

49:55.293 --> 49:57.295
If only you were as competent
in other areas as you-

49:57.629 --> 49:59.590
are with your wine, Brian.

50:04.302 --> 50:07.514
I cannot tolerate a man
who raises his hand to a woman.

50:07.931 --> 50:09.307
There is just no excuse.

50:29.911 --> 50:30.746
No!

51:14.790 --> 51:16.958
How long you think
that body's been there?

51:17.793 --> 51:20.211
Oh, two, three hours.

51:21.546 --> 51:22.798
(speaking Spanish)

51:22.881 --> 51:24.049
- You thirsty?

51:24.382 --> 51:24.966
(speaking Spanish)

51:25.216 --> 51:26.217
Carlos.

51:28.219 --> 51:30.806
Don't suppose any of your men
saw who dumped the body here, huh?

51:31.765 --> 51:33.642
They're on their coffee break.

51:34.976 --> 51:36.144
This is Mexico.

51:40.106 --> 51:41.900
- This looks like the work of Don Huertero.

51:42.192 --> 51:42.483
- Yeah.

51:42.734 --> 51:44.152
That's his style.

51:44.402 --> 51:46.154
He's got a temper, that one.

51:47.072 --> 51:50.116
So are you sure your Bobby Z
was at the hacienda?

51:50.533 --> 51:52.202
Yeah, I think so.

51:53.036 --> 51:54.996
Well maybe he's uh
somewhere here in the dump.

51:56.497 --> 51:57.833
I don't think I'm that lucky.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.003
What if uh, I was to find him for you?

52:02.921 --> 52:03.672
Well, uh

52:05.006 --> 52:07.634
I would appreciate
that very much, Jorge.

52:08.760 --> 52:10.136
How much very?

52:11.512 --> 52:13.264
5 grand U.S.

52:15.350 --> 52:17.435
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say 5?

52:17.769 --> 52:19.104
I, I meant to say ten.

52:20.146 --> 52:25.110
- I got bosses.
- 20.

52:27.779 --> 52:29.530
Think he made it to the mountainside?

52:31.616 --> 52:32.951
Well, he was a marine.

52:35.996 --> 52:37.538
Big, bad Boom Boom.

52:38.206 --> 52:38.790
Where are you?

52:39.040 --> 52:40.041
We're having a wake for Mad Dog.

52:40.291 --> 52:41.417
What d'ya want?

52:41.710 --> 52:43.211
I want Kearney dead.

52:43.378 --> 52:46.131
Every day without a body
costs me money. Now, pay attention.

52:46.547 --> 52:47.966
Are you listening to me, Boom Boom?

52:49.342 --> 52:50.719
I'm listening.

52:52.470 --> 52:54.347
Gruz, if you're lying
to me, I'll kill ya.

52:59.144 --> 53:00.478
Just talked to Gruz.

53:03.523 --> 53:04.983
So did he find Kearney?

53:05.191 --> 53:07.986
He says Kearney's headed
for the San Diego mountains.

53:09.237 --> 53:10.906
I want him in pieces.

53:11.990 --> 53:13.533
Tiny little pieces.

53:13.742 --> 53:16.036
I got a beautiful package
all ready for delivery.

53:16.327 --> 53:18.121
But there ain't gonna
be much of him left.

53:20.749 --> 53:21.666
Do it.

53:26.046 --> 53:27.714
Now you're moving too fast for me, kid.

53:30.216 --> 53:31.259
Does it hurt?

53:32.177 --> 53:33.011
Go.

53:46.274 --> 53:47.859
[Macy's Lodge CABINS]

53:57.202 --> 53:58.286
Hey, good afternoon.

53:59.287 --> 54:00.455
What it is.

54:01.706 --> 54:02.874
This your place?

54:04.125 --> 54:05.126
Yeah.

54:05.794 --> 54:07.545
Yeah? You uh-

54:09.130 --> 54:12.467
Excuse me, you got a
you got a first aid kit, by chance?

54:14.302 --> 54:15.553
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

54:16.221 --> 54:19.224
And uh, I'd like to get
one of these cabins for the night.

54:21.392 --> 54:22.643
60 bucks.

54:23.478 --> 54:24.855
What happened to your foot?

54:25.897 --> 54:27.774
- And uh, this old car right here, is that yours?

54:29.150 --> 54:30.902
- Yeah.
- Does it run?

54:31.236 --> 54:31.820
- It's alright.

54:32.070 --> 54:33.404
You wanna sell it?

54:59.264 --> 55:01.349
Alright, I'm gonna get
some shoes and some food

55:01.682 --> 55:03.852
and make a phone call,
and I'll be right back, okay?

55:04.602 --> 55:05.520
You're dumping me?

55:07.522 --> 55:09.190
No, I'm not dumping you.

55:10.733 --> 55:11.776
I just don't know who's out there

55:11.985 --> 55:12.944
and I don't want you to be
in any more jeopardy

55:13.236 --> 55:14.362
than you have to be, alright?

55:14.612 --> 55:16.281
I'm not scared of jeopardy.

55:28.543 --> 55:29.502
- What you doin'? Get back in the cabin.

55:29.710 --> 55:30.336
- No.

55:32.713 --> 55:34.090
Do what I say and get back
in the damn cabin.

55:34.299 --> 55:35.341
You're not the boss of me.

55:37.427 --> 55:38.469
- Get back in the cabin, Kit!

55:38.678 --> 55:40.346
- Oh, so you do know my name.

55:40.638 --> 55:41.597
- Of course I know your-

55:42.640 --> 55:44.517
- This is the first time
you've ever used it.

55:47.020 --> 55:48.271
Shall we?

56:01.742 --> 56:02.743
I'm going with you!

56:31.647 --> 56:32.607
What grade are you in?

56:34.359 --> 56:35.276
I don't know.

56:36.444 --> 56:37.904
What do you mean you don't know?

56:38.196 --> 56:41.782
Well, my mom was always going back
back and forth across the border.

56:43.201 --> 56:45.411
She was either drunk or stoned, so-

56:46.662 --> 56:48.331
I haven't been going to school.

56:54.462 --> 56:55.713
How old are you right now?

56:56.965 --> 56:58.883
Gonna be twelve the day after tomorrow.

57:14.399 --> 57:15.441
You have any friends?

57:16.985 --> 57:18.069
Do you?

57:29.830 --> 57:30.748
You wanna be friends?

57:34.502 --> 57:35.586
Maybe.

57:36.921 --> 57:38.089
Okay, maybe.

57:59.027 --> 57:59.860
- Is it okay?

58:00.486 --> 58:01.529
- Yeah, it'll be fine.

58:02.363 --> 58:04.365
I got uh, two different size boots.

58:04.657 --> 58:08.703
One pair is couple sizes bigger
than the other so it'll work.

58:29.390 --> 58:29.974
- Yeah.

58:30.225 --> 58:31.226
- Hey, it's me.

58:32.393 --> 58:33.311
- Bobby.

58:33.978 --> 58:34.812
- Z?

58:36.356 --> 58:37.315
Yeah.

58:38.024 --> 58:38.733
- Who the hell is this?

58:38.858 --> 58:39.984
- It's me.

58:43.863 --> 58:44.822
Where've you been?

58:45.948 --> 58:47.200
Man, where haven't I been.

58:48.451 --> 58:49.702
You sound different.

58:51.579 --> 58:52.747
Yeah, I am different.

58:53.039 --> 58:55.125
You haven't seen
the inside of a Thai prison.

58:55.416 --> 58:56.667
Yeah, I heard.

58:58.461 --> 58:59.295
Yeah.

59:00.963 --> 59:02.423
Where are you? I'll have someone get ya.

59:03.674 --> 59:05.843
How about uh... let's
meet somewhere in public.

59:06.177 --> 59:07.928
Well I can't, bro, I'm on my boat.

59:08.596 --> 59:10.431
I need a passport and some cash.

59:12.433 --> 59:14.185
- Well come over to my house
tomorrow at 1:00.

59:14.435 --> 59:15.686
- Yeah...That's fine.

59:26.281 --> 59:27.240
Looking for a man.

59:27.532 --> 59:31.411
Short hair, blue eyes, with a kid,
about 11, 12 years old.

59:31.952 --> 59:32.953
Hadn't seen him.

59:44.048 --> 59:45.175
Yup, they're here.

01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:20.060
So, who taught you
how to fight like that?

01:01:21.729 --> 01:01:23.731
I knew different guys who fought
different styles and-

01:01:24.023 --> 01:01:25.566
just trained real hard.

01:01:26.234 --> 01:01:27.777
Can you teach me how to fight like you?

01:01:31.739 --> 01:01:33.408
Oh man, the best thing to do
is just walk away from that stuff.

01:01:33.616 --> 01:01:35.701
Come on. You know.

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:37.495
Guy offers me candy.

01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:41.123
Alright man, If somebody offers you
candy, here's what you're gonna do.

01:01:41.749 --> 01:01:42.917
You're gonna square up with him
as best as you can, right?

01:01:43.209 --> 01:01:43.834
- Square up.
- Yeah.

01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:45.503
And the idea is
you wanna drive this knee-

01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:47.255
into his sack about as hard as you can.

01:01:47.588 --> 01:01:48.214
Sack.
Catch him off guard.

01:01:48.423 --> 01:01:49.590
Yeah, right in the sack.
Sack.

01:01:49.757 --> 01:01:51.342
Square with him like this
and just drive it home.

01:01:51.551 --> 01:01:52.385
Just drive it home.

01:01:53.428 --> 01:01:53.928
- Like that.

01:01:53.928 --> 01:01:55.179
- Do it again, do it again, do it again.

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:01.686
That's it.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.188
- That's it. That's perfect.
- I like that.

01:02:04.355 --> 01:02:05.105
Yeah.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:10.736
Kit, get away from the door.

01:02:13.239 --> 01:02:14.615
Get away from the door, Kit!

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.224
Down. Get down!

01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:57.575
No!

01:02:57.658 --> 01:02:58.993
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

01:02:59.327 --> 01:03:01.078
Don't! No-no!

01:03:01.329 --> 01:03:02.747
Please don't kill me!

01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:03.581
Don't you do it!

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:04.332
Don't kill me, man!

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.000
Please. Please, don't kill me, man.

01:03:06.208 --> 01:03:09.003
Don't kill me. Please. Please.

01:03:22.182 --> 01:03:23.726
Hey, give me the keys to your bike.

01:04:06.561 --> 01:04:07.227
What do you want?

01:04:07.395 --> 01:04:08.145
Girl, where you been?

01:04:08.228 --> 01:04:09.188
I've been trying to reach you.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.314
- Been busy.

01:04:10.565 --> 01:04:12.733
- Oh, they got phones in Mexico.

01:04:15.861 --> 01:04:17.237
Bobby's back, you know.

01:04:18.781 --> 01:04:20.032
- I heard.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.576
- I need a line on Z.

01:04:21.909 --> 01:04:24.078
I need to know what he's doing,
what he's thinking. Hear?

01:04:24.412 --> 01:04:25.871
- I don't know where he is.

01:04:26.831 --> 01:04:28.082
- Oh, he'll find you.

01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:32.252
And when he does, you're gonna play it
exactly like I tell you.

01:04:32.545 --> 01:04:33.921
You understand?

01:04:38.258 --> 01:04:38.926
Look.

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:44.640
If I deliver Bobby, I'm off the hook.

01:04:45.475 --> 01:04:47.977
I never hear from you again.

01:04:49.854 --> 01:04:51.856
I'll be waiting for your call, sugar.

01:05:00.072 --> 01:05:00.698
When did you get back?

01:05:00.906 --> 01:05:02.032
This morning.

01:05:04.869 --> 01:05:05.786
Sorry I wasn't here.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:07.371
I was out on the boat.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.626
- So who were you talking to?

01:05:11.876 --> 01:05:13.293
- Oh, I was just checking on Kit.

01:05:13.628 --> 01:05:15.796
I left him with some friends
so we could be alone.

01:05:17.465 --> 01:05:18.549
How is he?

01:05:19.675 --> 01:05:20.801
He's growing up.

01:05:28.017 --> 01:05:30.520
You're never gonna believe
who I got a call from today.

01:05:34.815 --> 01:05:35.733
Bobby.

01:05:38.027 --> 01:05:39.153
I thought he was in Thailand.

01:05:43.157 --> 01:05:44.283
Well, I guess he's back.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:48.162
Said he needs some cash and a passport.

01:05:53.042 --> 01:05:55.419
I told him to come by tomorrow,
we'd work something out.

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:04.094
Maybe it's time we just get out of here.

01:06:05.846 --> 01:06:07.640
You know, take the boat, just-

01:06:08.891 --> 01:06:10.350
disappear.

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:13.353
That'd be nice.

01:08:08.886 --> 01:08:10.054
Hey, you Bobby Z?

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:13.473
Yeah, man, I am Bobby Z.

01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:15.685
Go big or go home.

01:08:15.893 --> 01:08:18.895
Drop in balls deep. Balls deep.

01:08:19.313 --> 01:08:20.479
You want some of this, friend?

- Thank you.
- I'll take it.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.935
Keep that up-

01:08:59.185 --> 01:09:00.604
You got it. I'll put it over there.

Tim, stop playing.

Dude, I know this cat, man.

01:09:35.055 --> 01:09:35.765
- What's up?

01:09:35.973 --> 01:09:37.850
- Alright, I gotta talk to you
over here, man.

01:09:38.142 --> 01:09:39.518
- Hey. What's up?
What's up, man?

01:09:39.727 --> 01:09:40.644
- I'm Bobby Z.
- You're who?

01:09:40.895 --> 01:09:42.979
- Man, today, today I'm Bobby Z.

01:09:43.272 --> 01:09:44.398
- Oh.
- I'm Bobby Z today.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:45.149
- Oh, right.

01:09:45.357 --> 01:09:46.817
Oh. Oh, okay, alright.

01:09:47.026 --> 01:09:48.277
You Bobby Z, alright.

01:09:48.568 --> 01:09:49.111
Well feel me on this.

01:09:49.403 --> 01:09:51.613
If you Bobby Z uh, I want that watch.

01:09:55.575 --> 01:09:56.493
The watch.

01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:02.750
Alright.

01:10:04.752 --> 01:10:06.086
Nice seeing you, Bobby.

01:10:06.503 --> 01:10:07.755
Real nice seeing you.

01:10:09.006 --> 01:10:10.174
This shit real?

01:10:10.925 --> 01:10:11.842
Have a good time.

01:10:56.804 --> 01:10:57.721
Where's Kit?

01:10:59.598 --> 01:11:00.557
He's at your place.

01:11:02.517 --> 01:11:03.477
He's okay.

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:06.897
So who are you?

01:11:10.025 --> 01:11:11.151
How long have you known?

01:11:11.819 --> 01:11:14.404
Please. A woman knows
who she's making love to.

01:11:16.156 --> 01:11:17.407
Why didn't you bust me?

01:11:18.993 --> 01:11:20.244
I almost did.

01:11:21.703 --> 01:11:23.080
Then you stuck up for Kit.

01:11:23.789 --> 01:11:25.249
And you're good in bed.

01:11:26.708 --> 01:11:27.835
Better than Bobby?

01:11:34.842 --> 01:11:35.675
He's dead.

01:11:38.929 --> 01:11:39.930
Heart attack.

01:11:41.515 --> 01:11:42.557
Sorry.

01:11:45.477 --> 01:11:46.436
Don't be.

01:11:47.354 --> 01:11:48.898
He never cared about anyone but himself.

01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:55.154
I'm Tim Kearney.

01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.949
Tim.

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:01.035
So are we good?

01:12:02.161 --> 01:12:03.203
Bobby Z.

01:12:04.246 --> 01:12:04.872
Bobby Z.

01:12:05.205 --> 01:12:06.874
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

01:12:07.041 --> 01:12:08.625
I heard you were in-

01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:10.710
um Thailand.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.171
Yeah, I was.

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:13.839
Cool.

01:12:14.464 --> 01:12:15.715
Cool.

01:12:15.925 --> 01:12:18.218
So um-

01:12:18.552 --> 01:12:20.930
what was the coolest thing about that?

01:12:22.181 --> 01:12:23.015
- About Thailand?

01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:24.599
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:24.892 --> 01:12:25.935
Thais.

01:12:36.236 --> 01:12:37.112
- Where's uh, where's Monk?

01:12:37.404 --> 01:12:38.572
- He's upstairs.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:41.283
Yeah, you know, he has a boat
Mmhm.

01:12:41.575 --> 01:12:42.492
Is it big?

01:12:42.742 --> 01:12:43.994
He sells great weed for cash.

01:12:44.286 --> 01:12:44.995
What do you think?

01:12:45.204 --> 01:12:45.829
Alright.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.248
He ripped off Don Huertero
and blamed it on me.

01:12:49.166 --> 01:12:49.624
- I mean Bobby Z.

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:51.168
- I got- I gotta talk to him.

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:52.836
Not a good idea.

01:12:54.421 --> 01:12:55.422
Why, he won't believe I'm Bobby?

01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:58.050
No, he's not usually that fucked up
this early in the day.

01:12:59.801 --> 01:13:00.427
Yeah.

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:10.980
What do you want?

01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:14.942
Don't that look like
Boom Boom's bike over there?

01:13:17.945 --> 01:13:18.904
Son of a bitch.

01:13:20.364 --> 01:13:20.906
- Kearney in there?

01:13:21.115 --> 01:13:22.241
- Hey, hold on, cowboy.

01:13:22.449 --> 01:13:23.783
Wrong time, wrong place.

01:13:24.118 --> 01:13:26.203
I just wanted to let you know
Kearney was here.

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.914
Now you be careful about
how you take him out, hear?

01:13:29.123 --> 01:13:31.000
I don't wanna see you end up
like your brother Mad Dog.

01:13:31.416 --> 01:13:32.459
Oh, thank you.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:34.962
Thank you for the concern, officer.

01:13:35.379 --> 01:13:36.213
But Kearney ain't slitting my throat

01:13:36.296 --> 01:13:38.382
with no license plate
and neither are you.

01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:40.592
Yeah,

01:13:40.884 --> 01:13:43.929
I heard about your young partner
getting his head blown off at the border.

01:13:44.221 --> 01:13:45.389
- You heard about that?
- I heard about that.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.057
- Terrible thing.
- Yeah.

01:13:47.391 --> 01:13:50.185
You wanted to get rid of
all the eyewitnesses, didn't you?

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:52.687
Yeah, typical cop. No honor.

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:54.148
No loyalty.

01:13:55.065 --> 01:13:56.984
You scum-sucking pig.

01:13:57.276 --> 01:13:58.318
Who's paying you?

01:13:59.361 --> 01:14:02.072
You really do have
a vivid imagination, don't you Duke?

01:14:02.489 --> 01:14:05.742
Yeah. I imagine that
when I'm done with Kearney,

01:14:07.702 --> 01:14:09.163
I'm coming for you.

01:14:09.997 --> 01:14:11.748
Well you come on now.

01:14:11.999 --> 01:14:14.376
I will be anxiously waiting for you.

01:14:23.677 --> 01:14:25.012
So, who's that asshole?

01:14:29.099 --> 01:14:31.185
Some clown pretending to be Bobby.

01:14:34.688 --> 01:14:36.898
That's just the kind
of shit that drives Z crazy.

01:14:38.067 --> 01:14:38.858
Yup.

01:14:40.235 --> 01:14:41.361
Bobby's dead.

01:14:45.532 --> 01:14:46.616
He is.

01:14:47.867 --> 01:14:49.119
Yeah.

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.042
That's cool.

01:15:05.469 --> 01:15:07.471
So what're we gonna do
about this wannabe?

01:15:09.431 --> 01:15:10.474
Nothing.

01:15:12.892 --> 01:15:14.144
We'll be gone before it matters.

01:15:44.049 --> 01:15:45.092
What about Monk?

01:15:45.717 --> 01:15:46.260
Took care of it.

01:15:46.426 --> 01:15:47.677
Come on, I wanna go to the beach.

01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:49.679
- I need to see Kit.
- Okay.

01:15:57.062 --> 01:15:58.230
Why don't you just tell Don Huertero-

01:15:58.438 --> 01:16:00.440
that it was all a setup
and that Bobby's dead?

01:16:01.024 --> 01:16:02.609
Nah, he wouldn't believe me.

01:16:02.942 --> 01:16:04.778
There's been too much
spilled blood. Besides-

01:16:05.112 --> 01:16:07.489
I got DEA and bikers on my ass,

01:16:07.947 --> 01:16:09.283
not to mention Monk.

01:16:09.574 --> 01:16:11.576
I just gotta get the hell
out of the damn country.

01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:12.952
How are you gonna do that?

01:16:13.995 --> 01:16:16.165
Bobby Z enemies, Bobby Z problems,

01:16:16.456 --> 01:16:18.167
I need Bobby Z cash.

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:23.046
The great Bobby Z,

01:16:24.298 --> 01:16:25.048
The legend.

01:16:25.215 --> 01:16:26.258
Come in.

01:16:31.305 --> 01:16:32.139
Your son?

01:16:36.476 --> 01:16:37.311
Yeah.

01:16:40.772 --> 01:16:42.232
Did you think you could
just take my millions

01:16:42.441 --> 01:16:43.275
and get away?

01:16:43.983 --> 01:16:45.985
You and your friend, Monk?

01:16:46.486 --> 01:16:47.737
Let's go get your money.

01:16:47.987 --> 01:16:48.905
Doesn't involve them. Let 'em go.

01:16:49.114 --> 01:16:50.657
Let's go down to the marina right now.
It's on the boat-

01:16:51.074 --> 01:16:52.033
Shut up!

01:16:52.451 --> 01:16:53.702
Don't try to be brave.

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:55.704
You steal from me,
you destroy my daughter.

01:16:56.079 --> 01:16:57.331
You are a pig.

01:17:00.375 --> 01:17:02.336
You used her like a whore-

01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:04.254
and tossed her aside.

01:17:07.174 --> 01:17:09.426
She killed herself after that.

01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:13.305
Nico!

01:17:14.139 --> 01:17:14.764
- No!

01:17:14.973 --> 01:17:15.932
- Shut up!

01:17:17.058 --> 01:17:18.310
A child for a child.

01:17:18.518 --> 01:17:19.353
- He's not my kid.

01:17:19.686 --> 01:17:20.729
- Yes, I am!

01:17:22.356 --> 01:17:22.689
- Yes, I am!
- He's not my kid.

01:17:22.897 --> 01:17:24.983
- You don't deserve
to have a kid this brave.

01:17:25.275 --> 01:17:26.235
Nico!

01:17:26.443 --> 01:17:28.737
No, no, don't!

01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:30.113
Don't do it!

01:17:30.405 --> 01:17:31.240
Don't do it!

01:17:31.365 --> 01:17:32.782
He's your grandson!

01:17:33.617 --> 01:17:34.701
Look at him!

01:17:34.993 --> 01:17:36.453
Look at him!

01:17:36.661 --> 01:17:37.412
Look at his eyes!

01:17:37.621 --> 01:17:39.038
Look at his skin!
Look at his mouth!

01:17:39.373 --> 01:17:41.040
Don't you see Angelica?

01:17:41.875 --> 01:17:43.210
She was pregnant!

01:17:43.418 --> 01:17:46.255
That's why she ran.
She was afraid of you!

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:48.047
She ran away to have the baby.

01:17:48.215 --> 01:17:51.050
And Olivia was supposed to take him,
but Olivia couldn't take care of herself,

01:17:51.468 --> 01:17:53.345
So the poor kid came to me.

01:17:53.553 --> 01:17:56.055
And when I saw a chance for him
to get away, I let him go,

01:17:56.473 --> 01:17:58.975
so he wouldn't end up like his mother!

01:18:01.478 --> 01:18:02.521
My grandson?

01:18:16.075 --> 01:18:17.536
Nico,

01:18:17.744 --> 01:18:19.413
get him inside the car.

01:18:21.915 --> 01:18:23.500
Wait. Wait.

01:18:23.792 --> 01:18:25.043
Wait.

01:18:25.252 --> 01:18:26.503
You let him go

01:18:26.711 --> 01:18:28.797
or I'll kill every man in this room.

01:20:16.279 --> 01:20:17.656
The great Bobby Z,

01:20:18.782 --> 01:20:20.575
The legend.
No!

01:21:34.608 --> 01:21:36.067
Where the hell you been?

01:21:36.109 --> 01:21:39.153
- I'm going ape-shit in this place.
- Whoa, partner, I've been busy.

01:21:39.237 --> 01:21:40.739
- You've been busy?
- Yeah.

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:42.156
Meanwhile, I'm stuck in this hole

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.743
where room service
is the Burger King on the corner.

01:21:44.826 --> 01:21:46.828
I'm a vegan, Gruz.

01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:48.538
Relax, Bobby.

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:49.956
- Relax?
- Relax.

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:52.459
This place doesn't even have cable, man.
I'm missing volleyball.

01:21:52.542 --> 01:21:55.462
Well, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr. Zacharias,

01:21:55.545 --> 01:21:57.547
but like I say, I've been busy.

01:21:57.589 --> 01:22:00.341
Dealing with cops, handling the Monk.

01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:01.843
I got Tim Kearney out there,

01:22:01.968 --> 01:22:04.763
leaving a trail of bodies behind him
like Little Johnny Stiff-seed.

01:22:04.846 --> 01:22:08.600
I got motorheads blowing things sky high,
not to mention Don Huertero's people.

01:22:08.642 --> 01:22:10.268
Man, I don't give a shit
about inconvenience,

01:22:10.351 --> 01:22:12.353
I don't give a shit
about Don Huertero's people,

01:22:12.395 --> 01:22:14.481
or Monk, or the cops, or motorheads.

01:22:14.564 --> 01:22:18.985
I just care that all these guys think I'm dead.
And you're past due, Gruz.

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:22.781
- Do you want your money?
- Oh, hell, yeah, I want my money.

01:22:22.822 --> 01:22:24.866
I wanna give you your money.

01:22:24.991 --> 01:22:27.619
But you gotta show me a body
that these guys think is me, man.

01:22:27.702 --> 01:22:29.287
I'm working on it.

01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:31.164
- You're working on it.
- Yeah.

01:22:31.289 --> 01:22:33.792
All you had to do was kill Kearney
at the border like we planned.

01:22:33.875 --> 01:22:34.918
It would've been so simple.

01:22:35.001 --> 01:22:36.878
Look, I had him in my sights.
The son of a bitch tripped.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:40.965
- What do you want me to tell you?
- I want you to tell me Kearney is dead.

01:22:45.804 --> 01:22:48.807
Monk's girlfriend is taking care of it tonight.

01:22:50.224 --> 01:22:51.434
No shit?

01:22:51.935 --> 01:22:53.227
No shit.

01:22:53.352 --> 01:22:55.438
And she'll have Monk on the boat
in the morning-

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.649
if you wanna settle that score.

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:02.862
Did you know you had a kid?

01:23:04.155 --> 01:23:05.865
- No shit?
- No shit.

01:23:06.866 --> 01:23:08.993
- With who?
- Does it matter?

01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:12.706
Not really.

01:23:27.386 --> 01:23:28.972
Happy birthday.

01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:50.845
- Hey. You're here early.
- I'm anxious.

01:24:50.929 --> 01:24:54.766
No, you mean eager.
Anxious implies anxiety.

01:24:54.808 --> 01:24:57.435
- Nervousness.
- I'm anxious.

01:24:57.476 --> 01:25:00.563
Why? I've got plenty of cash.

01:25:00.647 --> 01:25:03.024
Going some place
even Huertero can't find us.

01:25:03.066 --> 01:25:04.567
Huertero's dead.

01:25:07.153 --> 01:25:09.072
This week just keeps getting
better and better.

01:25:09.155 --> 01:25:10.323
Yeah.

01:25:10.448 --> 01:25:13.952
Wait, if Huertero's dead and Bobby's dead,
why are we running?

01:25:18.039 --> 01:25:19.373
You're not.

01:25:21.167 --> 01:25:22.627
We are.

01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:24.503
Now, get out of here.

01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:28.549
Come on, man.

01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:32.345
Let me have my cash.

01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:35.056
I worked damn hard to steal that money.

01:25:44.482 --> 01:25:47.694
Seriously, dude,
you're just gonna let me walk out of here?

01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:50.947
I've got everything I want.

01:25:52.448 --> 01:25:54.325
Definitely not Bobby Z.

01:25:55.034 --> 01:25:56.619
Not even close.

01:26:01.415 --> 01:26:04.961
- Just take care of her, would you?
- Don't worry, he will.

01:26:05.962 --> 01:26:08.131
I was talking about my boat.

01:26:15.847 --> 01:26:18.557
- What're you doing?
- I'm rehabilitated.

01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:20.559
Hey, Kearney!

01:26:21.144 --> 01:26:22.186
Go downstairs.

01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:23.437
- There?
- No, go downstairs.

01:26:23.562 --> 01:26:25.690
- What about you?
- I'll be right back.

01:26:41.706 --> 01:26:43.582
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Put it to the side!

01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:45.584
- Kearney!
- Put it to the side!

01:26:45.668 --> 01:26:48.254
Go up there and get him! I'll block him off!

01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:06.731
- Don't move, Kearney!
- Look, man, I'm Bobby Z.

01:27:10.443 --> 01:27:13.738
I don't have any beef with you guys.
I don't know why you're shooting at me.

01:27:13.822 --> 01:27:17.116
- Look, man, I'm Bobby Z.
- You're not Bobby Z, you're Kearney, punk.

01:27:17.158 --> 01:27:18.326
Shut up.

01:27:18.367 --> 01:27:21.245
- Would you put your gun down?
- Shut your mouth.

01:27:37.971 --> 01:27:40.556
Wait a minute. We can work this out.

01:27:40.639 --> 01:27:42.350
That bitch lied to me.

01:27:42.391 --> 01:27:45.269
Oh, I see what the mix-up is.
You're looking for Kearney.

01:27:47.897 --> 01:27:51.109
Oh, well, shit, that's him right there,
in the back of the car with Gruz.

01:27:51.192 --> 01:27:52.902
- Hey, Kearney!
- What'd he just say?

01:27:52.986 --> 01:27:55.113
He said he's you. God damn.

01:27:55.196 --> 01:27:56.906
Come on out from behind that backseat.

01:27:56.948 --> 01:27:58.116
Hello, Tim?

01:27:58.241 --> 01:28:00.201
Someone's in the backseat of that car.

01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:02.495
There's your friend right there.

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.623
Get out of the car, both of you! Now!

01:28:05.706 --> 01:28:06.791
Hey, I'm sorry, Tim!

01:28:06.916 --> 01:28:07.917
What do we do?

01:28:08.001 --> 01:28:10.711
Get out of the car, do like the man says,
but be cool, Bobby.

01:28:10.837 --> 01:28:12.255
Just be cool.

01:28:14.924 --> 01:28:16.050
Damn.

01:28:20.013 --> 01:28:21.139
That's Kearney!

01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:22.640
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:28:22.723 --> 01:28:25.226
- Shoot him!
- That's Tim Kearney right there!

01:28:25.268 --> 01:28:26.310
- That's Kearney!
- That's Kearney!

01:28:26.435 --> 01:28:28.521
No, I'm Bobby Z! That's Kearney!

01:28:28.646 --> 01:28:29.647
Shoot his ass!

01:28:29.688 --> 01:28:32.025
- I'm Bobby Z!
- Oh, nice try, Tim!

01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:33.860
See, he's a terrible liar, so shoot him.

01:28:33.943 --> 01:28:35.528
I'm me! Come on, shoot him!

01:28:35.653 --> 01:28:38.072
That's Kearney!
Hey, my favorite color's yellow.

01:28:38.197 --> 01:28:39.532
- That's Kearney right there!
- I hate football!

01:28:39.657 --> 01:28:41.951
Gruz! You shut up! Who is this?

01:28:41.993 --> 01:28:44.954
I'm the real Bobby Z! I'm the legend!

01:28:44.996 --> 01:28:46.080
Dad!

01:28:47.373 --> 01:28:48.457
Dad!

01:28:50.418 --> 01:28:52.086
Jump, Dad, jump!

01:28:52.211 --> 01:28:53.880
Hey, son!

01:28:53.922 --> 01:28:55.298
Shoot him!

01:28:56.215 --> 01:28:59.385
- Shoot him!
- Come on, you idiots, shoot him!

01:29:00.219 --> 01:29:01.679
Jump! Come on!

01:29:02.096 --> 01:29:04.432
Wait a minute,
Kearney doesn't have any kids.

01:29:04.515 --> 01:29:06.309
Kearney doesn't have a kid!

01:29:10.396 --> 01:29:14.233
Hey, hey, don't shoot me, don't-
I'm a federal agent, God damn it!

01:29:29.373 --> 01:29:30.959
Beat by a loser.

01:29:45.932 --> 01:29:48.559
Jump, hurry up! Jump!

01:29:50.436 --> 01:29:52.105
Jump, Dad, jump!

01:29:54.773 --> 01:29:56.275
Go-time, baby!

01:29:56.317 --> 01:29:57.986
Jump, Dad, hurry!

01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:54.208
...And that's how Tim Kearney...

01:30:54.750 --> 01:31:01.440
A Three time loser from Palmdale
came to the Gold Coast and became Bobby Z.

01:31:02.883 --> 01:31:07.680
I know, I know... give me a break.
I mean the man is not Poseidon.

01:31:07.888 --> 01:31:09.557
..And he's not Neptune.

01:31:09.557 --> 01:31:11.434
But I'll tell you something else.

01:31:11.850 --> 01:31:13.186
He's got the boat-

01:31:13.519 --> 01:31:15.063
He's got the girl

01:31:15.063 --> 01:31:18.566
And the got a big bag full of cash.

01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:21.360
And down here along the Gold Coast, folks.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.279
That's what we call......

01:31:23.529 --> 01:31:25.031
A legend.
