WEBVTT

00:02.462 --> 00:03.918
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:04.088 --> 00:07.626
Visual confirmation is
required for payment.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.586
Meredith's gone,
she hung herself.

00:11.554 --> 00:13.260
Where the hell did you come from?

00:13.473 --> 00:15.759
- Father and daughter.
- We need to tell her the truth.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.682
She's going to see
the rest of the dead pool eventually.

00:18.978 --> 00:19.933
Malia?

01:04.106 --> 01:05.312
What?

01:05.525 --> 01:08.016
| always sleep in the middle of the bed.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.357
Not anymore.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.231
I know. I'm trying.

01:21.374 --> 01:22.830
Yeah. I can't get to sleep
unless I'm in the middle.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.157
Then we spoon.

01:24.377 --> 01:25.412
- I can spoon.
- Okay.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.118
I can spoon.

01:38.683 --> 01:39.923
What now?

01:40.142 --> 01:42.007
My arm's falling asleep.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.941
- I don't like this.
- I'm going to kill you.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.022
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.112
Okay then, just come here.

02:03.791 --> 02:04.997
Just come here.

02:11.674 --> 02:13.164
I think this is good.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.263
Yeah, this is good.

02:49.629 --> 02:53.042
Preliminary notes
on firearm discharge incident.

02:54.050 --> 02:58.134
Assailant armed with
sound-suppressor equipped Walther P88.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.922
Having heard the perpetrator's threat
and countdown,

03:03.434 --> 03:06.847
I made visual confirmation
of the barrel of the weapon

03:07.063 --> 03:09.349
pressed to the potential victim's head.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.556
Determining the danger
to be imminent,

03:13.194 --> 03:15.810
I felt no other choice but to respond

03:16.030 --> 03:17.986
with the use of deadly force.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.035
Thanks for waiting. I know it's late.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.829
It's okay. It's not like I'm going to be
going to school tomorrow anyway.

03:28.042 --> 03:31.830
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to drive
back to San Francisco tonight.

03:32.046 --> 03:35.538
I'll need to do a review at the field office.
But I'll be back as soon as I can.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.591
I might have to miss
the first game of the season.

03:40.763 --> 03:43.004
- It's no big deal.
- It is to me.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.464
I'm keeping my promises this time.

03:52.358 --> 03:54.849
What I did, it was necessary.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.401
Justifiable.
You know that, right?

03:58.447 --> 04:01.359
Have you done it before?

04:02.326 --> 04:03.987
Two other times.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.861
It's not easy, taking a man's life,

04:07.081 --> 04:09.743
even someone who forces you to do it.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.366
How do you deal with it?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.998
You look at it logically.
Without emotion.

04:15.214 --> 04:18.001
You compartmentalize.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.002
How do you do that?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.502
| used to do it by drinking.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.473
Come here, buddy.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.477
One more thing.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.943
When I do come back,
we have to talk about some stuff.

04:39.989 --> 04:42.981
You and your friends,
the way you guys handle things,

04:43.200 --> 04:45.782
it doesn't seem to faze you
like it should.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.446
It's like you guys
know something I don't.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.040
When I get back,

04:54.503 --> 04:56.289
I'd like to be in the know.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.716
ls three enough?

05:07.475 --> 05:09.807
Depends on how many cameras
they have. But I think so.

05:10.019 --> 05:13.136
Are we really doing this?
- We're doing it.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.607
- Tonight.
- But isn't it kind of dangerous?

05:15.816 --> 05:18.432
It's incredibly dangerous.
And borderline idiotic.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.028
Have you guys
done something like this before?

05:20.237 --> 05:21.818
Something dangerous?
Or something idiotic?

05:22.031 --> 05:23.271
I think it's a yes to both.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.198
You don't have to be part of it
if you don't want to.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.984
- I'm not scared.
- Then you're borderline idiotic.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.954
If we do this, we don't know what's
coming for us. You know that, right?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.078
How do we even know
something's definitely coming?

05:35.294 --> 05:37.956
Because the tape from Garrett's bag
said visual confirmation required.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.709
Simon said the same thing.
He couldn't get paid by The Benefactor

05:40.925 --> 05:43.086
until he had proof
that you guys were dead.

05:43.302 --> 05:47.591
So the idea is,
what if you kill someone on the dead pool,

05:47.848 --> 05:50.464
- but you can't send the proof?
- You don't get paid.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.811
How does that get us
any closer to The Benefactor?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.806
He still needs to know
if the target is really dead.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.229
Especially if it's someone high on the list.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.147
So, if he wants visual confirmation...

05:59.985 --> 06:02.522
He's going to have to come get it himself.

06:03.823 --> 06:05.279
Move, move, move!

06:06.617 --> 06:07.606
We need ECG.

06:07.827 --> 06:10.113
Dr. Geyer to the ER.
Dr. Geyer to the ER.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.328
- He's flat-lining.
- Get him to Trauma 2.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.532
Start another IV and
push a unit of epi.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.745
Clear!

06:19.296 --> 06:21.582
Still asystole.
Continue chest compressions.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.209
Charge to 360.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.042
Come on, come on, come on. Clear!

06:30.015 --> 06:32.506
Nothing. Still asystole.

06:36.856 --> 06:38.312
I'm calling it.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.940
Time of death

06:43.112 --> 06:45.068
21 :02 hours.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.949
Can someone
please page Melissa McCall?

08:17.873 --> 08:19.329
What are you doing?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.414
Protecting my investment.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.201
Why aren't you healing?

08:25.923 --> 08:27.788
Some wounds take longer.

08:28.384 --> 08:32.047
And some leave scars.
But not for people like you.

08:32.388 --> 08:34.003
So, what's going on?

08:34.264 --> 08:35.765
Maybe I'm just tired.

08:37.643 --> 08:38.598
Derek.

08:39.603 --> 08:42.185
- Show me your eyes.
- You just saw them.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.097
Show me your real eyes.

08:55.995 --> 08:57.405
Okay.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.953
Now, why don't you
tell me what's really going on?

09:03.460 --> 09:06.202
No! No!

09:09.258 --> 09:12.421
What happened to my son?

09:22.354 --> 09:24.891
Are you guys totally sure about this?

09:25.482 --> 09:27.143
I think Liam's kind of nervous.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.315
Maybe you should
tell him it's going to be all right.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.280
It's going to be all right.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.696
So, you've done this before, right?

09:35.451 --> 09:36.531
I've seen it done.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.575
ls thatjust as good?

09:38.787 --> 09:39.651
No.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.821
Mom, you're not inspiring confidence.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.032
Good. This is a terrible idea.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.832
Do you want us to do it without you?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.508
Put your hand over his heart.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.928
Hold on.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.109
What happens while I'm out?
Am I gonna feel anything?

10:12.529 --> 10:14.394
It might feel like you're dreaming.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.647
Good dreams or bad?

10:16.992 --> 10:19.108
I suppose that depends on you.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.575
I still hate this plan.

11:12.047 --> 11:16.381
I mean this is pretty
significantly terrifyingly. He looks dead.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.300
Give me your hand.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.052
It's okay.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.179
Wait for it.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.280
Is that enough to keep a werewolf alive?

11:37.489 --> 11:38.774
Enough for an Alpha.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.569
- How much time do we have?
- Forty-five minutes.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.241
What happens after that?

11:43.453 --> 11:44.989
I bring him back the same way.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.949
No, I mean what happens if he stays like
this longer than forty-five minutes?

11:51.545 --> 11:52.705
No one's told her?

11:53.714 --> 11:57.548
What? What happens
after forty-five minutes?

11:59.344 --> 12:00.504
He dies.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.648
That's your assassin speak?

12:18.822 --> 12:20.778
I said he's dead.
What more do you want?

12:20.991 --> 12:23.323
It was a little dry.
You could've said something like,

12:23.535 --> 12:26.777
"Target has been neutralized.
The crow flies at midnight."

12:26.997 --> 12:28.487
That's always cool.

12:37.299 --> 12:40.632
Type this:
"Visual confirmation isn't possible.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.635
"Police coming to claim
body in 40 minutes."

12:48.685 --> 12:52.348
Tell him number one on the list is dead.
I killed him.

12:52.564 --> 12:55.397
And if the wire transfer
isn't completed in forty minutes...

13:03.200 --> 13:04.690
It's just a graze.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.779
But make sure it doesn't get infected.

13:11.583 --> 13:15.952
That's probably something you've never
had to worry about before, is it?

13:18.423 --> 13:20.288
So, it's everything then?

13:20.884 --> 13:23.296
No glowing eyes, no healing.

13:23.512 --> 13:27.596
Smell, hearing, speed, everything.

13:27.849 --> 13:28.804
Strength?

13:29.017 --> 13:30.393
I can still win a fight.

13:43.407 --> 13:44.567
You ready?

13:46.743 --> 13:49.405
One, two...

13:52.499 --> 13:54.490
God! You cheated.
That's cheating.

13:54.710 --> 13:58.578
I won. When you're a human
facing off against the supernatural,

13:58.797 --> 14:00.879
you need to bend the rules a little bit.

14:01.717 --> 14:04.299
I'm gonna teach you how to bend.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.890
I'm here. You ready?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.693
Try it now.

15:37.020 --> 15:37.975
Catch!

15:47.781 --> 15:49.317
That's why you're team captain.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.109
I can't do that. I can't kill them.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.111
Someone has to.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.118
- Why me?
- Because you're the Alpha.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.033
I'm not a murderer.

16:43.587 --> 16:46.954
- But you are a predator.
- No. We're predators...

16:48.383 --> 16:50.374
But we don't have to...

16:52.012 --> 16:53.752
We don't have to...

17:22.417 --> 17:23.827
Scott!

17:25.128 --> 17:27.289
Scott, please!

18:40.161 --> 18:42.493
I've gotta buy a better safe.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.185
What about him?

19:09.649 --> 19:13.187
No. He's in here every week
with a new self-diagnosis.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.518
Hypochondﬁac?

19:14.738 --> 19:16.399
Prescription drug addict.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.660
Why are we doing this?

19:25.081 --> 19:27.697
Why are we asking them
to fight these kinds of fights?

19:28.960 --> 19:32.327
Because otherwise
we'd be asking them to run and hide.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.137
Is that supposed to look like that?

19:45.393 --> 19:46.803
No. No, it's not.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.351
- Where is that?
- The roof.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.770
- Someone's gonna have to check it out.
- I'll go.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.189
Whoa, whoa.
This might notjust be a malfunction.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.267
That's why I'm bringing this.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.068
I'm coming with you.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.148
Okay. And you're both
coming right back. Immediately.

20:02.494 --> 20:03.574
Kids.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.415
I can't let you leave here with that.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.330
Maybe you won't have a choice.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.507
Is that right?

20:20.220 --> 20:21.801
I think I could take you.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.011
You've heard rumors
I'm not as strong as | used to be.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.639
Something like that.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.989
I said you can't leave with it.
I didn't say you couldn't read it.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.968
- Oh, God.
- Mom!

21:08.685 --> 21:10.892
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

21:12.605 --> 21:13.731
Nothing.

21:17.152 --> 21:19.564
How did you know I was here?
Did you follow me?

21:19.779 --> 21:22.942
No, I'm getting ready
for the open house tomorrow.

21:23.241 --> 21:26.108
- The open house is next week.
- Okay, I followed you.

21:26.828 --> 21:29.786
Honey, you come up here every weekend,
sometimes even during the week,

21:29.998 --> 21:32.239
and as far as I can tell,
there's no boy involved,

21:32.459 --> 21:34.541
so I really have
no clue what you're up to.

21:35.587 --> 21:38.420
I'm trying to figure something out.
Something important.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.043
And honestly, Mom,
you don't need to be involved

21:41.259 --> 21:43.215
in every single detail of my life.

21:43.428 --> 21:46.340
No. But I'd like to help if I can.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.308
Do you know her?

22:01.112 --> 22:02.522
Meredith Walker?

22:34.604 --> 22:35.559
Catch!

22:43.321 --> 22:44.936
That's why you're the Alpha.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.039
There's something different, isn't there?

22:57.418 --> 22:59.079
I've got more fangs.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.752
I noticed it during the quarantine.

23:02.674 --> 23:03.754
I don't know why.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.878
Maybe it's part of being an Alpha.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.258
Like you're becoming
more of a werewolf.

23:08.429 --> 23:09.885
Or more of a monster.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.513
What if it makes you stronger?

23:12.934 --> 23:14.674
What if it's like you're growing?

23:16.729 --> 23:18.185
Evolving.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.421
Looks like someone did something to it.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.013
I think somebody did...

24:12.952 --> 24:15.329
The power's out in the whole building.
I lost all the cameras.

24:15.538 --> 24:16.698
Stay with Scott.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.704
Text me if you see or hear anything.

24:25.924 --> 24:29.257
This is a Sig Sauer P226.9 mm.

24:29.928 --> 24:31.338
I don't like guns.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.465
That's because you've never
learned to use one.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.717
Or because I've been shot.

24:35.934 --> 24:36.969
Repeatedly.

24:37.185 --> 24:38.891
You'll like this one.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.687
The legal clip size in California is ten.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.265
You always want to remember
how many shots you fire.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.684
Running out of bullets
can get you killed.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.485
It also makes you look stupid.

24:52.450 --> 24:55.533
But using a gun isn'tjust about
learning how to point and shoot.

24:55.745 --> 24:56.655
Why's that?

24:56.871 --> 24:59.954
Because an average person
can move 21 feet in 1.5 seconds.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.454
If they have a knife, they can gut you
before you can pull and fire.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.456
So with a gun,

25:05.672 --> 25:07.333
you need distance.

25:11.844 --> 25:12.970
Go for it.

25:13.846 --> 25:14.972
Pull the gun on me.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.471
So, yeah.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.351
Wanna try again?

25:38.579 --> 25:41.446
- One more time.
- I could do this all day.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.171
You cheated.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.132
Learning to bend.

26:24.709 --> 26:26.165
You wanna talk about it?

26:27.545 --> 26:29.126
See a family counselor?

26:29.922 --> 26:31.332
There's nothing in there.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.880
Cost me a lot of money to get that file.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.549
You got ripped off.

26:37.055 --> 26:40.593
You know what happens
when you only hear one side of a story?

26:41.309 --> 26:44.142
You only heard one side of the story.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.395
It's a good plan.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.821
You're not worried, are you?

27:45.748 --> 27:46.863
Just thinking.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.327
About what?

27:52.338 --> 27:54.875
That we've never actually
been on a real date.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.082
There hasn't been time.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.505
We could make time.

28:01.055 --> 28:03.592
Even though people
are dying all around us?

28:04.308 --> 28:05.514
Okay.

28:06.561 --> 28:07.971
Maybe after that.

28:09.063 --> 28:11.395
We could see a movie.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.147
Haven't seen a movie in forever.

28:16.279 --> 28:17.985
That sounds like a plan.

28:19.574 --> 28:20.859
It's a good plan.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.415
Kira!

28:29.750 --> 28:31.126
Kira! Get up!

28:32.587 --> 28:35.044
Kira!
Kira! Get up!

28:41.387 --> 28:44.345
I'm guessing the power
doesn't go out often in this hospital.

28:44.557 --> 28:48.175
No. Only when under attack
by supernatural creatures.

28:58.196 --> 28:59.857
Come on, come on.
Answer the phone.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.063
Answer the phone.
Argent, come on.

29:03.117 --> 29:06.109
Come on, Argent, answer the phone.
Why are you not answering the phone?

29:08.664 --> 29:09.824
Stiles, run.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.121
Stiles, get out of here.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.388
Get out of the way, Stiles.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.014
I'm taking the body.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.143
Why? Visual confirmation?

29:40.029 --> 29:43.021
Don't worry, handsome.
I'm not The Benefactor.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.944
Then what do you want with the body?

29:46.827 --> 29:48.567
| wish I could tell you.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.372
| always forget you carry two.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.088
You murdered people.

30:01.634 --> 30:04.046
Not killed. Murdered.

30:04.262 --> 30:06.218
There were extenuating
circumstances.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.386
Like what? The fire?

30:08.599 --> 30:12.262
A fire that nearly burned me alive.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.936
Six years in a coma.
Do you know what that's like for one of us?

30:16.899 --> 30:18.810
It's not a pleasant sleep.
Imagine it.

30:19.026 --> 30:21.813
Being trapped in your body,
but still being fully cognizant.

30:22.029 --> 30:25.237
Unable to do anything
other than listen to your own thoughts

30:25.449 --> 30:29.283
slowly driving you absolutely
and totally insane,

30:29.495 --> 30:31.827
minute-by-minute, day-by-day.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.080
Yes, I've done horrible, terrible things.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.996
And so have a lot of people.

30:38.546 --> 30:42.004
And horrible, terrible things
are going to keep happening.

30:42.216 --> 30:46.004
Especially when there's a dead pool
with your name on it.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.136
But not yours.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.059
True.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.643
But I am not The Benefactor.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.863
I'm just a guy
who's out millions of dollars.

31:05.031 --> 31:10.116
A few thousand of which
I used trying to help you.

31:10.870 --> 31:11.859
Me?

31:12.079 --> 31:15.116
How does the bad guy
prove that he's not so bad?

31:16.417 --> 31:18.248
By doing an act of kindness.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.372
What could you ever do for me?

31:21.088 --> 31:22.999
Help you find your mother.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.504
I'm pretty interested myself

31:27.720 --> 31:30.302
as the memory was stolen
from me by my sister, Talia.

31:32.725 --> 31:33.931
Okay.

31:34.477 --> 31:35.637
What did you find?

31:35.853 --> 31:37.764
A woman, might be her.

31:39.148 --> 31:42.686
I don't have a name yet,
just a particularly interesting alias.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.733
She's called The Desert Wolf.

31:46.697 --> 31:48.653
Do you know what that means?

31:49.784 --> 31:51.069
Coyote.

32:15.226 --> 32:17.808
- Are you still a kitsune?
- Technically.

32:28.489 --> 32:30.229
These are your grandmother's ashes.

32:32.743 --> 32:36.452
Grandma died in Eichen House.

32:36.664 --> 32:39.280
Your father had
a difficult relationship with his mother.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.865
But after the things she said,

32:41.043 --> 32:42.283
and the way she acted...

32:42.503 --> 32:43.913
He thought she was crazy.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.666
Well, she said she heard things.

32:49.385 --> 32:50.875
Why did she want her ashes in here?

32:51.053 --> 32:52.589
Well, actually, she didn't.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.672
She left instructions
to have them spread across the lake.

32:56.851 --> 32:58.307
How come you haven't done it?

32:58.519 --> 33:00.180
Because she wanted you to do it.

33:01.230 --> 33:02.561
When you turned 18.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.854
Don't ask me why.

33:05.067 --> 33:07.979
But since there's only
a few weeks till that,

33:08.320 --> 33:10.697
I suppose now is as
good a time as any.

33:22.585 --> 33:23.540
Mom,

33:25.045 --> 33:26.751
these aren't Grandma's ashes.

33:27.631 --> 33:28.666
What do you mean?

33:28.883 --> 33:30.168
- Of course they are.
- No.

33:37.391 --> 33:39.052
It's Mountain Ash.

33:51.405 --> 33:52.565
The whole building.

33:54.825 --> 33:56.565
It's all made of Mountain Ash.

33:57.661 --> 33:58.741
Back off!

33:58.913 --> 34:00.824
You sure you can pull
the trigger fast enough?

34:01.040 --> 34:03.156
- I don't want to.
- You're not going to kill me.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.366
I'm not going to let you take his body.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.661
Okay, well, obviously,
you guys have a lot to talk about,

34:09.882 --> 34:12.874
so, maybe... I saw some coffee,
a vending machine outside.

34:13.093 --> 34:14.833
Listen to me, Kate.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.294
We have a plan.

34:16.514 --> 34:19.130
And if killing Scott was part of it,
you're worse than me.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.682
He's telling the truth.
We're trying to get to The Benefactor.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.725
If you didn't notice,
you're on that list too.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.395
- And you're worth more than most.
- That's why I'm here.

34:26.607 --> 34:28.893
Then back off and let us do
what we planned.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.451
Take the Berserkers, and go.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.079
Kate, please.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.032
We have a plan.

34:52.049 --> 34:55.007
Liam, run. Get out of here.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.005
Liam!

35:43.183 --> 35:44.434
Catch!

35:53.569 --> 35:54.934
Why did you do that?

35:57.656 --> 35:59.157
Let me help you.

36:00.618 --> 36:01.983
Let me show you how.

36:58.300 --> 36:59.836
What happened? Did it work?

37:07.893 --> 37:08.848
What?

37:09.061 --> 37:10.346
It's your mother.

37:11.647 --> 37:12.636
She's hurt.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.734
No, no, no, no, no. Stay with me.

37:20.447 --> 37:22.904
- What the hell happened here?
- Just help me get her off the floor.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.160
You were right.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.838
He's still alive.

37:39.633 --> 37:41.419
Thank God.

37:48.726 --> 37:49.715
Hey.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.306
Where have you been?

37:55.065 --> 37:56.566
Talking to Peter.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.483
Okay. You think that's a good idea?

38:01.113 --> 38:03.320
If he can help me find my mother,

38:03.532 --> 38:04.863
I don't think I care.

38:06.285 --> 38:09.197
You might be related to him,
but you're not like him.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.615
Maybe I am.

38:15.878 --> 38:18.039
That night I caused the car crash...

38:18.255 --> 38:20.962
You mean when you were
out-of-control on the full moon.

38:21.175 --> 38:22.881
There's a part I didn't tell you about.

38:23.093 --> 38:24.924
Right before we got in the car,

38:25.137 --> 38:26.377
my mother...

38:28.265 --> 38:30.426
My adoptive mother, I guess,

38:31.018 --> 38:32.679
we got into a huge fight.

38:32.895 --> 38:35.477
I don't even remember
what it was about.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.643
But I remember what I said.

38:38.984 --> 38:39.939
Malia.

38:40.194 --> 38:42.685
I said, "I wish you were all dead."

38:44.239 --> 38:46.400
Killing doesn't run in a family.

38:47.701 --> 38:49.407
Maybe it does in mine.

39:37.751 --> 39:40.493
My mom's being taken
to a hospital in Palo Alto.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.577
They actually put her in a helicopter.

39:43.841 --> 39:45.832
But she's going to be okay?

39:46.426 --> 39:49.793
Yeah. She just doesn't
heal like she used to.

39:51.849 --> 39:53.714
I need to be there with her.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.805
- Especially if she's still on the list.
- I know.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.430
You should go.

39:58.689 --> 40:00.520
I actually have to go back
to the hospital too.

40:00.732 --> 40:04.099
They want to do a bunch of tests
since I was kind of officially dead.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.275
I guess Liam's dad
has a lot of questions.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.149
Yeah.

40:08.991 --> 40:11.107
I just wish it had all worked.

40:11.785 --> 40:13.025
It was a good plan.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.486
Yeah, I've been
thinking about that too.

40:17.165 --> 40:18.951
And actually, I think maybe it did work.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.249
Not that I know exactly
who The Benefactor is

40:21.503 --> 40:23.835
but we might know
a lot more about him now.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.880
But no one came.
And no one got visual confirmation, right?

40:27.092 --> 40:29.003
That's why it might have worked.

40:29.386 --> 40:30.421
Think about it.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.837
Who has the power to know
when someone's dead,

40:33.056 --> 40:36.014
but doesn't need to see
the body to know it happened?

40:37.769 --> 40:39.020
A Banshee.

40:43.442 --> 40:46.104
This is the last thing your grandmother
wrote down before she died.

40:46.320 --> 40:49.232
Don't even know why I kept it
because it's basically nonsense.

40:56.288 --> 40:58.779
Are you absolutely sure
Grandma's dead?

40:59.666 --> 41:00.826
Yes.

41:02.252 --> 41:04.459
I mean, she has to be.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.086
This isn't nonsense, Mom.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.418
It's code.
