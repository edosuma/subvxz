WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:03.668
<i>WHAT IS IN THE CLOSET?</i>

00:06.939 --> 00:09.074
THIS WAS HER
GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.344
THEY FOUND HER
ON THE FLOOR.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.910
SHE'S HERE.

00:12.945 --> 00:14.547
WHAT'S IN THE CLOSET?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.813
I DON'T KNOW.

00:15.848 --> 00:18.484
YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT
THIS ONE STORY OVER HERE.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.719
BUT IT'S BIGGER.

00:21.987 --> 00:24.590
- "YOU DO NOT GET OUT."<i>
- DID YOU MAKE IT WARM IN HERE?</i>

00:29.662 --> 00:31.462
I'M AMY BRUNI.

00:31.463 --> 00:33.865
AND I'M ADAM BERRY.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.933
WE'VE SPENT
A COMBINED 30 YEARS

00:35.968 --> 00:39.572
INVESTIGATING THE WORLD'S
MOST TERRIFYING HAUNTINGS.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.205
AFTER THOUSANDS OF CASES,

00:41.240 --> 00:44.477
WE ARE READY FOR OUR
MOST IMPORTANT JOURNEY YET.

00:46.412 --> 00:50.549
RESCUING FAMILIES TERRORIZED
BY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

00:50.584 --> 00:53.418
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.289
WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH
BEHIND THE HAUNTING

00:56.324 --> 00:59.125
TO HELP FAMILIES
RECLAIM THEIR HOMES...

00:59.160 --> 01:00.676
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:00.711 --> 01:02.193
...AND THEIR LIVES.

01:02.194 --> 01:05.230
CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY
DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS

01:09.869 --> 01:11.571
WE'VE BEEN CALLED HERE
BY A WOMAN NAMED KRISTY.

01:11.606 --> 01:13.123
SHE HAS TWO KIDS.

01:13.158 --> 01:14.605
ONE'S 8.
ONE IS 5.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.574
SHE'S EXTREMELY NERVOUS.

01:16.609 --> 01:19.612
THEY'VE BEEN SEEING
THIS SHADOW FIGURE.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.097
THEY CALL IT
THE SHADOW MAN.

01:21.132 --> 01:22.513
WANDERS AROUND THE HOUSE?

01:22.548 --> 01:25.451
YEAH. I MEAN,
THEY'VE SEEN HIM IN THEIR ROOMS.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.018
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL HER KIDS.

01:27.019 --> 01:29.422
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THIS THING
IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN SEEING.

01:29.457 --> 01:32.623
SHE WANTS HER KIDS
NOWHERE NEAR THE INVESTIGATION.

01:32.658 --> 01:35.495
I THINK THAT SHE'S NERVOUS
TO, LIKE, FIND OUT WHO IT IS.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.031
I THINK SHE'S NERVOUS
TO HAVE IT IN HER HOUSE,

01:38.066 --> 01:40.532
BUT SHE'S ALSO NERVOUS
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.935
SHE'S SCARED.
I THINK HER KIDS ARE SCARED.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.602
AND SHE WANTS
ANSWERS FOR THEM.

01:44.637 --> 01:48.040
DOES SHE HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO SHE THINKS IT IS?

01:48.075 --> 01:51.310
SHE THINKS IT MIGHT
BE HER GRANDMOTHER.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.512
THIS WAS HER
GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.712
OKAY.

01:54.747 --> 01:57.199
SHE AND HER GRANDMOTHER
HAD A BIG FALLING OUT.

01:57.234 --> 01:59.652
AND SHE HADN'T TALKED TO
HER GRANDMOTHER IN YEARS.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.038
SHE WAS NEVER ABLE
TO GET CLOSURE.

02:02.073 --> 02:05.183
AND THEN HER GRANDMOTHER
PASSED AWAY.

02:05.218 --> 02:08.294
HER FAMILY CONVINCED HER
TO BUY THE HOME.

02:13.065 --> 02:14.534
IT'S IMPORTANT
WHEN WE DO THESE CASES

02:14.569 --> 02:16.369
TO NOT ASSUME
WE KNOW WHO IS THERE.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.901
- HI.
- I'M KRISTY.

02:17.936 --> 02:19.539
I REALIZE A LOT
OF THESE FAMILIES WE DEAL WITH

02:19.574 --> 02:21.239
DO THINK
THEY HAVE A GOOD IDEA

02:21.240 --> 02:24.375
OF WHO OR WHAT
IS IN THEIR HOME.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.578
BUT WE'VE JUST FOUND,
IN SO MANY CASES,

02:26.613 --> 02:29.682
IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT THEY EXPECTED,

02:29.717 --> 02:32.717
OR THERE'S MORE THERE
THAN WHAT THEY REALIZED.

02:32.752 --> 02:35.754
I KNOW WE TALKED ON THE PHONE,
AND WE E-MAILED A FEW TIMES.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.507
BUT THIS IS JUST
KIND OF OUR CHANCE

02:37.542 --> 02:39.801
TO GO THROUGH
THE HOUSE WITH YOU.

02:39.836 --> 02:42.061
AND YOU CAN JUST
KINDA TELL US AREAS

02:42.096 --> 02:43.427
THAT THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.

02:43.462 --> 02:46.232
WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITY HAVE
YOU EXPERIENCED IN THIS ROOM?

02:46.267 --> 02:49.936
UM, A LOT OF TIMES WHEN
I'M SITTING ON THIS COUCH,

02:49.971 --> 02:53.606
I CAN HEAR NOISES COMING
FROM THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.139
SOMEBODY RUMMAGING AROUND.

02:55.174 --> 02:58.327
I'LL TAKE A WALK BACK AND LOOK,
AND OBVIOUSLY NOBODY'S THERE,

02:58.362 --> 03:01.481
AND THAT'S WHEN IT OCCURS TO ME
THAT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.817
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.

03:05.818 --> 03:08.371
MOST OF THE TIMES
THAT I'M IN HERE,

03:08.406 --> 03:10.348
I HEAR NOISES COMING
FROM THE CLOSET.

03:10.383 --> 03:12.388
THAT'S WHERE I HEAR
RUMMAGING AND STUFF.

03:12.423 --> 03:14.359
IT'S STRANGE.
I ACTUALLY GET CHILLS.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.329
I'VE TRIED TO REPLICATE IT.
I'VE TRIED TO FIGURE IT OUT.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.263
WHAT'S MAKING THAT NOISE?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

03:19.298 --> 03:21.900
NOW, HAVE YOUR KIDS
HAD ANY EXPERIENCES IN HERE?

03:21.935 --> 03:24.035
UM, YES.
ACTUALLY, MY SON SAW

03:24.070 --> 03:27.607
A SHADOW FIGURE,
UM, IN THIS CORNER.

03:29.775 --> 03:32.444
AND HE SAID IT
VERY MATTER-OF-FACTLY.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.179
IT JUST WAS, UM,

03:34.180 --> 03:36.849
"HEY, THERE WAS
A SHADOW FIGURE."

03:36.884 --> 03:38.382
HE WAS KINDA CONFUSED.

03:38.417 --> 03:40.302
WHO USED TO SLEEP
IN THIS ROOM BEFORE?

03:40.337 --> 03:42.188
GROWING UP, THIS WAS
MY GRANDMA'S ROOM.

03:42.223 --> 03:43.822
WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY,

03:43.823 --> 03:46.692
UM, THEY FOUND HER
ON THE FLOOR OVER THERE.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.562
SHE WAS EITHER GETTING
INTO OR OUT OF BED.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.795
COVERS WERE TURNED BACK.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.633
SHE WAS IN HER PAJAMAS,
RIGHT ALONG BY THE WINDOW THERE.

03:53.668 --> 03:56.035
UM, SO WE'RE NOT
SURE WHAT HAPPENED.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.269
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

03:57.304 --> 04:00.705
DOROTHY.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.640
THIS IS CALEB'S ROOM.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.608
MY DAUGHTER SAW,
SHE SAID,

04:04.643 --> 04:06.913
A SHADOW MAN
STANDING RIGHT HERE.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.417
ACTUALLY, NOT THAT LONG AGO,
MAYBE ONLY ABOUT A WEEK

04:11.452 --> 04:12.950
OR SO AGO, HE CAME OUT.

04:12.985 --> 04:15.421
AND HE SAID THAT HE HEARD
BREATHING IN HERE,

04:15.456 --> 04:16.890
WHICH I'D NEVER
HEARD HIM SAY BEFORE.

04:16.925 --> 04:18.289
THAT WAS A SURPRISE
TO ALL OF US.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.860
HE HAS NEVER HEARD
THAT OR SAID THAT BEFORE.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.734
YOU HAVE AN IDEA AS TO WHO
YOU THINK COULD BE HERE, RIGHT?

04:28.735 --> 04:32.304
UM, I FEEL THAT IT'S MOST
LIKELY MY GRANDMA

04:32.339 --> 04:33.638
WHO LIVED HERE.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.708
I GREW UP COMING
TO THIS HOUSE A LOT.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.628
WE WERE VERY CLOSE.
SHE BABYSAT ME.

04:38.663 --> 04:41.478
SO I WAS HERE ALL THE TIME,
UNTIL 2005.

04:41.513 --> 04:45.883
UM, SHE WENT INTO THE HOSPITAL
TO HAVE A PROCEDURE DONE.

04:45.884 --> 04:47.386
I DIDN'T GET TO VISIT HER
IN THE HOSPITAL,

04:47.421 --> 04:48.619
BUT I DID CALL HER.

04:48.654 --> 04:50.055
AND AFTER SHE GOT
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.355
I CALLED HER UP ONE DAY.

04:51.390 --> 04:53.757
AND SHE YELLED AT ME
ABOUT SOMETHING,

04:53.792 --> 04:56.494
I DON'T KNOW EVEN WHAT SHE SAID,
AND HUNG UP ON ME.

04:56.495 --> 05:00.399
AND SHE NEVER SPOKE
TO ME AGAIN AFTER THAT.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.833
I GOT MARRIED.
I HAD MY DAUGHTER.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.070
EVEN THOSE EVENTS,
IT WASN'T EVEN ENOUGH FOR HER

05:04.105 --> 05:05.836
TO WANNA BE IN MY LIFE.

05:05.871 --> 05:07.806
AND IT SOUNDS CRAZY.
AND THAT'S --

05:07.807 --> 05:09.740
I'M AFRAID OF, LIKE,
ACTUALLY BEING JUDGED LIKE,

05:09.775 --> 05:11.477
"COME ON. YOU HAD TO HAVE DONE
SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT."

05:11.512 --> 05:13.110
BUT HONESTLY, THAT'S IT.

05:13.145 --> 05:15.181
AND I THOUGHT, MAYBE SHE'S
UNHAPPY THAT WE'RE HERE.

05:15.216 --> 05:16.614
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T
WANT US HERE.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.784
THAT WAS MY BIGGEST FEAR MOVING
HERE IS, HOW DOES SHE FEEL?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.986
AND THERE'S NO WAY
OF ME KNOWING THAT.

05:22.054 --> 05:25.024
AFTER SHE DIED, HOW LONG AFTER
DID YOU SAY,

05:25.059 --> 05:26.993
"YES, I'M GONNA
BUY THE HOUSE"?

05:27.028 --> 05:28.893
I REALLY STRUGGLED
WITH THIS,

05:28.928 --> 05:32.231
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHO COULD
GIVE ME THE RIGHT ANSWER.

05:32.266 --> 05:35.532
SO THIS SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT I WAS DESPERATE.

05:35.567 --> 05:39.371
WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY, THERE WAS
A NUN THAT WAS AT HER SERVICE

05:39.406 --> 05:41.506
THAT JUST SEEMED
REALLY NICE,

05:41.541 --> 05:44.894
SO I WENT AND TALKED TO THIS NUN
AND I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION.

05:44.929 --> 05:48.606
AND I WAS SO NERVOUS
ABOUT HOW MY GRANDMA
WOULD FEEL ABOUT THIS.

05:48.641 --> 05:52.284
LIKE, THIS WAS, LIKE, THE MOST
EMOTIONAL TIME OF MY LIFE EVER.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.252
AND SO
I TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.921
AND SHE SAID TO ME,
"DON'T BUY THE HOUSE.

05:56.922 --> 06:00.057
NO. THERE'S TOO MUCH
NEGATIVITY."

06:00.092 --> 06:02.094
AND THAT'S WHERE I KIND OF
GOT MY ANSWER,

06:02.129 --> 06:04.061
BECAUSE SHE WAS, LIKE,
SO "NO, NO, NO."

06:04.096 --> 06:06.431
IN MY MIND, I WAS LIKE, "BUT,
NO, I ACTUALLY THINK I SHOULD."

06:06.466 --> 06:08.099
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY
VALIDATED IT FOR ME,

06:08.100 --> 06:09.735
WHICH THAT DOESN'T
SOUND RIGHT.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.654
I WENT AGAINST HER
COMPLETELY.

06:11.689 --> 06:13.539
SO YOUR FIRST DAY
IN THE HOUSE,

06:13.574 --> 06:15.139
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

06:15.174 --> 06:17.342
I WAS VERY NERVOUS.
I WAS TERRIFIED.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.510
I REMEMBER SITTING THERE
THINKING,

06:19.511 --> 06:22.014
"I'M NEVER GONNA SLEEP AGAIN.
WHAT DOES SHE THINK?"

06:22.049 --> 06:24.150
I MEAN, I THOUGHT --
KNOWING HER PERSONALITY,

06:24.185 --> 06:26.483
THE WRATH
WAS GONNA COME DOWN.

06:26.518 --> 06:29.421
YOU KNOW, IN THIS CASE,
WE HAVE A LOT TO START WITH

06:29.422 --> 06:31.192
- FOR TONIGHT, FOR SURE.
- WE DO. A LOT.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.912
WHAT WE'RE DOING,
THERE'S JUST A LOT AT STAKE.

06:36.947 --> 06:39.965
KRISTY'S SO EMOTIONALLY
INVESTED IN THE OUTCOME.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.236
WHAT IF WE DO GET
AHOLD OF GRANDMA?

06:45.638 --> 06:47.471
- I THINK WE ARE GOOD.
- GOOD.

06:47.506 --> 06:49.640
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD
PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS

06:49.641 --> 06:51.742
WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING,

06:51.777 --> 06:55.548
LIKE, DIRECT, CONVERSATIONS
WITH WHATEVER IS HERE.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.716
I REALLY WANNA DO
THE SPIRIT BOX EXPERIMENT.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.951
- OKAY.
- ARE YOU READY?

06:58.986 --> 07:01.385
YEAH. I'M READY.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.290
THE SPIRIT BOX SCANS
THROUGH RADIO FREQUENCIES,

07:04.325 --> 07:06.357
SOMETIMES PICKING UP
ON WORDS.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.292
ONE OF US WEARS
NOISE-PROOF HEADPHONES

07:08.327 --> 07:11.213
AND A BLINDFOLD AND JUST LISTENS
TO THE SPIRIT BOX.

07:11.248 --> 07:14.325
THE PERSON LISTENING SAYS
WHATEVER THEY CAN DECIPHER.

07:14.360 --> 07:17.402
AT THE SAME TIME, THE OTHER
ONE OF US ASKS QUESTIONS.

07:17.403 --> 07:21.104
AND WE HOPE THAT
THERE'S A CORRELATION.

07:21.139 --> 07:23.742
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS, PLEASE.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.928
UM, YOU CAN TALK
INTO THIS LITTLE BOX.

07:25.963 --> 07:28.080
AND AMY IS,
HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE ABLE

07:28.115 --> 07:30.767
TO HEAR YOU ANSWER.
OKAY?

07:30.802 --> 07:33.419
DOROTHY, ARE YOU HERE?

07:35.787 --> 07:37.922
"PREPARE."

07:37.957 --> 07:40.392
ARE YOU HERE, DOROTHY?

07:40.427 --> 07:41.792
"WHAT IS IT?"

07:41.827 --> 07:44.197
YES OR NO, DOROTHY.
ARE YOU HERE?

07:47.299 --> 07:49.066
"NO."

07:49.101 --> 07:51.671
IF YOU'RE NOT PART
OF THE FAMILY,

07:51.706 --> 07:55.474
CAN YOU TELL ME
YOUR NAME?

07:55.509 --> 07:57.141
"AMY."

07:57.176 --> 07:59.010
DID YOU KNOW
THAT IS AMY?

08:01.046 --> 08:03.680
"I DON'T."

08:03.715 --> 08:05.751
IS THIS MAKING
ANY SENSE?

08:07.986 --> 08:11.156
IT'S STRANGE.
IT IS A LITTLE STRANGE.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.123
WHY?

08:12.158 --> 08:13.325
I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"

08:13.360 --> 08:14.693
AND YOU WERE LIKE, "AMY."

08:14.728 --> 08:16.160
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.796
AND THEN I WAS LIKE,
"DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS AMY?"

08:18.797 --> 08:21.965
AND IT SAID, "I DON'T."

08:22.000 --> 08:23.802
THE SPIRIT BOX SAYS
THE NAME AMY.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.436
IT'S -- IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.172
AND IT DIDN'T SAY
THAT IT WAS TALKING ABOUT HER.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.876
SO WHO'S AMY?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:29.911 --> 08:32.509
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY EVIDENCE

08:32.544 --> 08:35.246
THAT POINTS TO WHO
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.647
- BUT THE --

08:36.648 --> 08:38.017
****

08:38.052 --> 08:39.950
WHAT WAS THAT?

08:39.985 --> 08:42.471
- IT WAS NOT.
- IT WAS COMING FROM DOWN THERE.

08:42.506 --> 08:44.957
IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE IT
CAME FROM THIS CLOSET.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.156
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT?

08:46.191 --> 08:48.094
DID ANYTHING
FALL IN HERE?

08:48.129 --> 08:50.060
DO YOU SEE?

08:50.095 --> 08:52.164
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MADE THAT SOUND.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.531
IT WAS VERY BASSY.

08:54.566 --> 08:56.600
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT --

08:56.635 --> 08:59.337
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN HERE
THAT WOULD MAKE THAT SOUND.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.040
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.543
BUT WE'VE HEARD SOMETHING
SIMILAR TO WHAT SHE HEARS,

09:04.578 --> 09:06.845
SO WE KINDA KNOW
NOW WHAT SHE'S EXPERIENCED.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.078
THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.

09:08.113 --> 09:09.313
YEAH.
I MEAN, I THINK WE SHOULD

09:09.348 --> 09:12.201
PROBABLY INVESTIGATE
IN HERE FOR A WHILE.

09:12.236 --> 09:15.054
I MEAN, BASICALLY
THAT JUST LED US HERE.

09:15.089 --> 09:17.122
ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS AMY AND ADAM,

09:17.123 --> 09:19.659
AND WE ARE
IN KRISTY'S BEDROOM.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.829
CAN YOU MAKE A KNOCKING
SOUND LIKE THIS?

09:30.035 --> 09:32.538
WHAT IS IN THE CLOSET?

09:33.805 --> 09:36.041
DO YOU LOVE KRISTY?

09:38.000 --> 09:44.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

09:49.388 --> 09:50.423
I'M SORRY.

09:57.829 --> 09:59.363
WHAT WAS THAT?
CUT, CUT.

09:59.364 --> 10:01.167
IT DID SOUND LIKE
TWO KNOCKS.

10:01.202 --> 10:03.668
BUT, LIKE, EVP KNOCKS?

10:03.703 --> 10:05.001
WE CAN'T HEAR THEM TALKING.

10:05.036 --> 10:07.638
SO WHY SHOULD WE HEAR --
ALWAYS HEAR THEM KNOCKING?

10:07.639 --> 10:10.976
IF IT'S TALKING TO US,
IT'S GOTTA BE IN THE SAME PLANE,

10:11.011 --> 10:12.275
OR WHEREVER THEY ARE.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.345
IT'S DOING WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING.

10:14.346 --> 10:16.882
HERE.
LET'S TRY IT SOME MORE.

10:21.086 --> 10:23.289
WHAT IS THAT?

10:40.339 --> 10:41.607
HOLY --

10:45.744 --> 10:47.513
THAT'S FRIGHTENING.

10:51.383 --> 10:53.619
I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE
HEARD THAT COME OUT OF THIS --

10:53.654 --> 10:54.652
THE MACHINE.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.154
WHAT'S IN THE CLOSET?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.623
I DON'T KNOW.

10:59.491 --> 11:01.794
THIS THING IS REALLY TRYING
TO GRAB OUT ATTENTION.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.696
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A --
A GRUFF VOICE.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.330
IT'S ANGRY AND ORNERY.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.600
AND IT MATCHES THE DESCRIPTION
OF HER GRANDMOTHER.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.937
BUT WE HAVE NOTHING
COMPLETE AND CONCLUSIVE.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.575
SHOULD WE DO SOME EVP?

11:16.610 --> 11:18.509
YEAH.

11:18.544 --> 11:21.113
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

11:23.682 --> 11:25.885
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

11:28.987 --> 11:32.091
IS THERE SOMETHING
IN THAT CLOSET IN THE BEDROOM?

11:35.594 --> 11:37.063
LET'S LISTEN.

11:41.032 --> 11:43.300
<i> WHY ARE YOU HERE?</i>

11:43.335 --> 11:45.871
<i> IS THERE SOMETHING
IN THAT CLOSET IN THE BEDROOM?</i>

11:45.906 --> 11:47.304
WHAT?

11:47.339 --> 11:49.807
<i> WHY ARE YOU HERE?</i>

11:49.842 --> 11:51.977
<i> IS THERE SOMETHING
IN THAT -- </i>

11:52.012 --> 11:53.212
SOMETHING...

11:53.247 --> 11:55.045
SILVER?

11:55.046 --> 11:57.213
<i> WHY ARE YOU HERE?</i>

11:57.248 --> 12:00.619
<i> IS THERE SOMETHING
IN THAT CLOSET IN THE BEDROOM?</i>

12:06.057 --> 12:08.760
MY GOD.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.428
- IT SOUNDED FEMALE.
- IT DID.

12:11.463 --> 12:12.798
WELL, NOW WE HAVE
STUFF TO GO ON.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.332
- WE HAVE A NAME.
- AMY.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.902
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL
NOT TO READ INTO IT.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.772
RIGHT.
EITHER THEY'RE TALKING TO ME,

12:20.807 --> 12:23.607
OR MAYBE THERE IS
AN ENTITY NAMED AMY.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.077
IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE
WE'RE HEARING THESE KNOCKS,

12:26.112 --> 12:28.478
AND THEN WE GET A GROWL
RESPONSE ABOUT THE CLOSET.

12:28.513 --> 12:33.752
AND THE ONLY TIME SHE EVER
HEARS ANYTHING IS IN THE CLOSET.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.820
AND THIS IS ALL
IN THE SAME ROOM

12:35.821 --> 12:37.355
WHERE HER GRANDMOTHER DIED.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.855
YOU KNOW
WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

12:38.890 --> 12:40.724
WE SHOULD TALK
TO KRISTY'S HUSBAND

12:40.759 --> 12:43.327
AND GET SOME OF THE GRANDMA'S
BELONGINGS TO USE

12:43.362 --> 12:46.231
AS TRIGGER OBJECTS DURING
OUR INVESTIGATION TOMORROW.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.366
YEAH.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.367
ALL RIGHT.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.403
GOT IT?
I'M GONNA PUT THIS AWAY.

13:01.446 --> 13:05.083
SO, KIM, THANK YOU
FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.483
I APPRECIATE IT.

13:06.484 --> 13:08.985
OKAY,
SO AS KRISTY'S MOTHER,

13:09.020 --> 13:11.723
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS
THAT'S GOING ON?

13:11.724 --> 13:13.523
- IT'S INTERESTING.
- YEAH.

13:13.558 --> 13:17.796
I'M HOPING IT BRINGS KRISTY
SOME CLOSURE ON A COUPLE THINGS.

13:17.831 --> 13:21.166
SHE SEEMS TO BE KIND OF EXCITED
ABOUT IT, SO...

13:21.201 --> 13:22.499
YEAH.

13:22.534 --> 13:26.104
HAVE YOU FELT THAT THERE
HAS BEEN SOMETHING GOING ON

13:26.139 --> 13:27.270
IN THIS HOUSE?

13:27.305 --> 13:29.173
I HAVE AT DIFFERENT TIMES.

13:29.208 --> 13:32.778
MY EX-MOTHER-IN-LAW
USED TO SMOKE...

13:33.946 --> 13:36.080
...A LOT
AND IN THE HOUSE.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.667
AND I'D COME OVER
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK

13:38.702 --> 13:41.219
AND WATCH THE KIDS,
HELP OUT WITH THE KIDS.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.954
AND ONE TIME,
I JUST HAD THIS, LIKE --

13:43.989 --> 13:46.425
ALL OF A SUDDEN, A REAL --
AND I DON'T SMOKE.

13:46.460 --> 13:47.725
NOBODY IN THE HOUSE
SMOKES.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.893
NOBODY WHO COMES INTO THE HOUSE
SMOKES.

13:49.928 --> 13:53.298
BUT I HAD THIS REALLY STRONG
SMELL OF CIGARETTE SMOKE,

13:53.333 --> 13:55.701
WHICH JUST DIDN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.045
AWESOME.
HERE, YEAH.

14:07.080 --> 14:11.449
THERE'S A BIBLE.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.686
I MEAN, THERE'S
QUITE A BIT OF STUFF.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.289
THIS IS A LAST RITES CROSS.

14:18.324 --> 14:22.227
WHEN SOMEONE IS SICK, THEY, UM,
USE IT AS A PRAYER ALTAR.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.260
AND THEY PUT
THEY CANDLES HERE.

14:23.295 --> 14:24.496
AND THERE'S HOLY WATER
HERE USUALLY.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.699
- OKAY.
- AND IT'S BEEN USED.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.903
MAYBE SHE'LL LET US KNOW,
IF SHE'S HERE,

14:30.938 --> 14:33.336
WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO
WITH THEM.

14:33.371 --> 14:36.942
HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY ACTIVITY
IN THE HOUSE YOURSELF?

14:36.977 --> 14:40.112
I HAVE, ACTUALLY
IN THE ROOM HERE.

14:40.147 --> 14:43.247
IT WAS...
ONE NIGHT, WE WERE SLEEPING.

14:43.248 --> 14:47.050
FELT A TAPPING
ON MY SHOULDER.

14:47.085 --> 14:50.305
LIKE, SOMEBODY TRYING TO,
GET MY ATTENTION OR WAKE ME UP.

14:50.340 --> 14:53.525
I IMMEDIATELY ROLLED OVER,
TRIED TO SEE IF IT WAS KRISTY.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.292
BUT SHE WAS SOUND ASLEEP.

14:55.327 --> 14:57.662
THE WAY SHE WAS LAYING,
THERE WAS NO WAY

14:57.697 --> 14:59.429
THAT SHE COULD HAVE
TAPPED ME

14:59.464 --> 15:03.333
AND THEN GOT BACK OVER
WITHOUT ME NOTICING.

15:03.368 --> 15:05.370
NIGHT ONE,
WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.604
BUT WE HAVE NOTHING COMPLETE.

15:07.639 --> 15:09.941
BUT WE'RE HOPING INVESTIGATING
WITH THESE TRIGGER OBJECTS

15:09.976 --> 15:11.509
CAN POINT US
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

15:11.544 --> 15:13.379
AND GIVE US SOME ANSWERS.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.794
THE ONLY THING
THEY NEVER GOT RID OF

15:29.829 --> 15:33.264
WAS THE CATHOLIC
MEMORABILIA HERE.

15:33.299 --> 15:36.301
LET'S PUT 'EM OUT.

15:36.336 --> 15:39.638
I MEAN,
THERE'S LOTS IN HERE.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.940
AND THIS --
THIS IS COOL.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.476
WE'RE PLACING THE K-II METER

15:44.511 --> 15:45.976
NEXT TO THE GRANDMOTHER'S THINGS

15:46.011 --> 15:48.847
TO MONITOR FOR
ELECTROMAGNETIC ANOMALIES.

15:48.882 --> 15:50.113
IF ANYTHING IS HERE,

15:50.148 --> 15:52.350
THE DEVICE WILL LIGHT UP
AND LET US KNOW.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.717
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

15:53.752 --> 15:55.819
READY?
LET'S ASK SOME QUESTIONS.

15:55.820 --> 15:56.855
ALL RIGHT.

16:00.391 --> 16:02.995
IS THIS DOROTHY?

16:06.564 --> 16:09.001
DO THESE OBJECTS
BELONG TO YOU?

16:12.770 --> 16:16.308
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE
TO SAY TO KRISTY AND HER FAMILY?

16:18.410 --> 16:22.581
SHE'S SAD BECAUSE
SHE FELT LIKE...

16:22.616 --> 16:25.183
YOU REALLY
DIDN'T LIKE HER.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.818
HEY, LIGHT'S GOING OFF.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.421
IT'S REALLY GOING OFF.

16:28.456 --> 16:29.989
IT'S REALLY GOING OFF.

16:44.769 --> 16:48.307
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE
TO SAY TO KRISTY AND HER FAMILY?

16:50.275 --> 16:53.946
SHE'S SAD BECAUSE
SHE FELT LIKE...

16:53.981 --> 16:57.049
YOU REALLY
DIDN'T LIKE HER.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.434
HEY, LIGHT'S GOING OFF.

16:58.469 --> 17:00.361
IT'S REALLY GOING OFF.

17:00.396 --> 17:02.219
IT'S REALLY GOING OFF.

17:02.254 --> 17:05.057
DO YOU ENJOY WATCHING
HER IN THIS HOUSE NOW?

17:07.325 --> 17:09.094
DO YOU STILL LOVE
EACH OTHER?

17:11.463 --> 17:15.165
IS THERE MORE YOU
WANT TO SAY?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.800
SAY IT NOW.

17:19.502 --> 17:21.170
IT STOPPED FLASHING NOW.

17:21.204 --> 17:23.040
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
IT'S RELIABLE ENOUGH RIGHT NOW

17:23.075 --> 17:24.842
TO SAY IT'S ANYTHING
FOR SURE.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.444
BUT I THINK IT'S INTERESTING
THAT IT'S HAPPENING

17:26.480 --> 17:27.546
WHILE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THIS.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.778
FOR SURE.
FOR SURE.

17:28.813 --> 17:30.380
LET'S GO INTO
THE KIDS' BEDROOM

17:30.415 --> 17:33.218
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET
A MORE CLEAR RESPONSE THERE.

17:36.454 --> 17:38.188
THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

17:38.189 --> 17:40.891
ANYTHING
THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY,

17:40.926 --> 17:43.294
YOU JUST NEED TO SAY IT
INTO THIS LITTLE SILVER BOX.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.664
IT'S A RECORDER.
IT JUST HEARS YOUR VOICE.

17:45.699 --> 17:47.366
AND WE CAN PLAY IT BACK.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.033
SO I'M GONNA SET IT DOWN.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.735
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA
BE TOTALLY QUIET.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.239
AND YOU JUST COME UP,
AND YOU SAY WHATEVER IT IS

17:54.274 --> 17:57.106
THAT YOU NEED TO SAY
TO THIS FAMILY, OKAY?

17:57.141 --> 18:00.879
IF YOU KNOW THEM, GREAT.
IF YOU DON'T, THAT'S FINE, TOO.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.546
BUT WHATEVER IT
IS YOU WANNA SAY,

18:02.547 --> 18:03.747
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE,
OKAY?

18:03.782 --> 18:05.684
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA
SET THIS RIGHT HERE,

18:05.719 --> 18:07.150
AND YOU JUST WALK
RIGHT UP TO IT

18:07.185 --> 18:10.289
AND JUST SPEAK INTO IT
AS LOUDLY AS YOU CAN.

18:20.798 --> 18:23.936
LET'S SEE
IF WE GOT ANYTHING.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.389
WHAT?

18:45.424 --> 18:46.923
I CAN'T TELL
WHAT IT'S SAYING.

18:46.958 --> 18:49.962
BUT IT'S JUST TALKING, TALKING,
TALKING, TALKING, TALKING.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.771
IS IT TALKING LIKE IT'S --
LIKE IT'S A FEMALE, RIGHT?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.206
HOW DO WE GO BACK
TO KRISTY AND SAY,

19:01.241 --> 19:03.006
"WELL, THERE IS THIS THING

19:03.041 --> 19:05.076
IN YOUR SON'S ROOM
THAT'S TALKING UP A STORM,

19:05.111 --> 19:07.278
BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S SAYING"?

19:07.313 --> 19:08.946
WHAT'S WEIRD
IS IT'S LIKE --

19:08.981 --> 19:10.215
IT'S TALKING --

19:10.250 --> 19:11.415
LIKE, REALLY --

19:11.450 --> 19:13.850
I CANNOT MAKE OUT
WHAT IT'S SAYING.

19:13.885 --> 19:19.424
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY
TO BRING IN A PSYCHIC.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.158
YEAH.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

19:21.159 --> 19:23.462
I THINK
WE SHOULD BRING IN CHIP.

19:33.004 --> 19:34.304
AS FAR AS PSYCHICS GO,

19:34.305 --> 19:36.005
CHIP IS ABOUT AS GOOD
AS THEY GET.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.110
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
ON MANY OCCASIONS.

19:38.145 --> 19:40.110
HE'S A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE.

19:40.111 --> 19:41.378
WE'RE USING HIM AS A TOOL,

19:41.413 --> 19:45.849
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER TOOL
IN OUR ARSENAL.

19:45.884 --> 19:49.220
ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP US
GET A CLEARER PICTURE.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.654
I KNOW NOTHING,

19:50.689 --> 19:52.290
BUT I'VE ALREADY BEEN
PICKING UP STUFF.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.325
EVEN FROM OUTSIDE?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.394
YEAH.

19:57.862 --> 20:01.499
LITTLE BIT OF NAUSEA.

20:01.534 --> 20:05.101
I GET A PUSH ON THE BED.

20:05.136 --> 20:07.303
I FEEL, LIKE,
PRESSURE ON THE BED,

20:07.338 --> 20:08.974
LIKE, ALMOST, LIKE,
IF SOMEONE'S LYING IN BED,

20:09.009 --> 20:11.109
THEY'D JUST SIT UP
AND ARE STARTLED.

20:11.144 --> 20:13.645
- OKAY.
- YEAH, OKAY.

20:17.381 --> 20:19.184
ATTACHED TO A FEMALE.

20:22.587 --> 20:25.857
AND THAT'S ALL THEY WANNA
GIVE ME AT THIS POINT IN TIME,

20:25.892 --> 20:28.393
ATTACHED TO A FEMALE.

20:31.496 --> 20:32.595
THE WORD THAT
CAME INTO MY HEAD

20:32.630 --> 20:35.333
WHEN I WALKED INTO
THIS ROOM WAS "STOP!"

20:35.368 --> 20:38.036
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE "STOP" IS.

20:40.438 --> 20:42.006
WHEN YOU CAME INTO THIS ROOM,
IT SAID, "STOP"?

20:42.041 --> 20:44.907
I HEARD, "STOP!"

20:44.942 --> 20:49.414
I DON'T GET IT
COMPLETELY YET.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.582
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW...

20:52.617 --> 20:54.619
YOU'VE GOT
TWO THINGS HERE.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.652
OKAY.

20:55.687 --> 20:56.920
THERE FEELS LIKE
THERE'S A FEMALE.

20:56.921 --> 20:59.256
THERE FEELS LIKE
THERE'S A KID.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.591
- OKAY.
- YOU KNOW THAT OLD SAYING

21:01.592 --> 21:02.825
OR THAT SONG OR WHATEVER,

21:02.860 --> 21:04.495
"ONE OF THESE THINGS
IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER"?

21:04.530 --> 21:06.364
THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING HERE.

21:06.365 --> 21:08.266
ONE OF THESE THINGS
IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER.

21:08.301 --> 21:11.334
LIKE, THE --

21:11.369 --> 21:14.004
THE FEMALE,
I FEEL SHE WAS SICK.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.640
AND I GET MEDICAL THINGS
A LOT.

21:18.609 --> 21:21.646
PRESSURE IN MY HEAD,
A LITTLE BIT OF NAUSEA,

21:21.681 --> 21:23.815
BUT SHORT OF BREATH AND...

21:25.584 --> 21:28.319
- OKAY.
- THAT SORT OF THING.

21:28.354 --> 21:29.318
FEELS LIKE THERE'S ENERGY

21:29.353 --> 21:32.622
FLOWING IN HER
DIRECTION FROM THIS.

21:32.657 --> 21:35.259
AND SOMEWHERE, SOMEHOW,
THERE'S A STORY OF CHILD ABUSE.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.328
OKAY.

21:42.266 --> 21:43.635
THAT'S THE CONNECTION
TO YOU.

21:53.712 --> 21:56.247
SOMEWHERE, SOMEHOW,
THERE'S A STORY OF CHILD ABUSE.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.516
OKAY.

22:03.387 --> 22:06.523
THAT'S THE CONNECTION
TO YOU.

22:06.558 --> 22:07.757
AND YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S THE CHILD.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.427
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT
A CHILD YET, CORRECT?

22:09.462 --> 22:11.594
NO.

22:11.629 --> 22:13.264
MNH-MNH.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.468
WOW, THAT JUST HIT ME
IN THE HEART.

22:20.705 --> 22:23.073
YOU'RE THE MAGNET.

22:23.074 --> 22:25.026
NOT THAT YOU DON'T LOVE CHILDREN
AND EVERYTHING,

22:25.061 --> 22:26.978
BUT YOU'RE NOT A MOMMY,
AND THIS IS A MOMMY.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.846
THIS IS A PROTECTIVE
MAMA-BEAR MOMMY.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.015
AND THIS CHILD IS, LIKE...

22:31.050 --> 22:33.482
OKAY.

22:33.517 --> 22:34.953
YOU'RE HER SAFETY NET.

22:34.988 --> 22:38.188
OKAY.

22:38.223 --> 22:40.392
YOU'RE GONNA BE SURPRISED
BY WHAT YOU GET THERE.

22:42.827 --> 22:45.263
OR YOU CAN BE.
I HOPE YOU WILL BE.

22:45.298 --> 22:47.431
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:47.466 --> 22:50.568
YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT
THIS ONE STORY OVER HERE.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.337
BUT IT'S -- IT'S BIGGER.

23:06.951 --> 23:08.651
IT'S --

23:08.686 --> 23:11.555
AMY, ADAM, IT'S GONNA
TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.358
SHE JUST SAID TO ME
WHEN I WALKED DOWN HERE,

23:13.393 --> 23:14.793
SHE GOES,
"I HIDE DOWN HERE."

23:17.529 --> 23:20.065
IT'S LIKE A HIDE-AND-SEEK THING.
"I HIDE DOWN HERE."

23:20.100 --> 23:23.701
IF YOU DIG DEEP ENOUGH,
OR YOU TRY HARD ENOUGH,

23:23.736 --> 23:25.270
WITH THE EVP
AND THE CONTACT STUFF,

23:25.305 --> 23:26.804
THIS CHILD WILL COME
THROUGH TO YOU.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.238
I'LL BET YOU ANYTHING.

23:28.273 --> 23:31.042
DO YOUR --
DO THE THINGS THAT YOU DO BEST.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.176
ANYBODY THAT KNOWS
YOUR WORK KNOWS

23:33.211 --> 23:34.912
THAT YOU GUYS CAN
REACH OUT TO SOMETHING.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.698
AND IT'S,
99 PERCENT OF THE TIME,

23:36.733 --> 23:38.449
WILLING TO COMMUNICATING
WITH YOU.

23:38.450 --> 23:41.119
BUT THE DEAL IS THIS CHILD
IS JUST JONESING

23:41.154 --> 23:42.553
TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU.

23:42.554 --> 23:44.186
AND YOU MAY NOT THINK
THAT'S THE STORY.

23:44.221 --> 23:46.257
BUT THAT'S A FACET
OF THE STORY NONETHELESS...

23:46.292 --> 23:48.560
- OKAY.
- ...OF WHAT'S IN THIS HOUSE.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.829
YEAH.
I'M GONNA GO SIT FOR A MINUTE.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.864
OKAY.

23:54.765 --> 23:56.466
WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN?

23:56.501 --> 24:01.840
FEISTY AND, YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE GRUMPY.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.206
OKAY.

24:03.207 --> 24:05.109
SHE'S EITHER CONNECTED
TO THIS HOUSE OR TO THIS FAMILY,

24:05.144 --> 24:06.977
BUT SHE'S GOT --

24:06.978 --> 24:09.681
SHE'S GOT A CONNECTION
THAT LAYS WITHIN THESE WALLS

24:09.716 --> 24:11.482
OR ON THIS PROPERTY.
- RIGHT.

24:11.517 --> 24:12.917
THE KID, I DON'T KNOW.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.450
OKAY.

24:14.485 --> 24:17.688
SHE THREW HERSELF
RIGHT INTO MY CONSCIOUSNESS

24:17.689 --> 24:21.958
AND...

24:21.993 --> 24:24.596
SHE'S -- SHE'S JUST --
I MEAN, SHE'S BREAKING MY HEART.

24:24.631 --> 24:27.330
ALL RIGHT.

24:27.365 --> 24:30.135
SHE FEELS LIKE SHE'S FINALLY
GOT SOMEBODY'S ATTENTION.

24:30.170 --> 24:33.036
SHE'S GOT --
SHE'S GOT...

24:33.071 --> 24:38.243
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE,
SHE FEELS HAPPINESS AND HOPE.

24:38.278 --> 24:39.828
DO WHAT YOU'VE GOTTA
DO OVER HERE.

24:39.863 --> 24:41.379
I MEAN, THERE'S THIS STUFF
OVER HERE.

24:41.414 --> 24:42.812
AND THEN THERE'S...
- OKAY.

24:42.813 --> 24:44.014
...OVER HERE.

24:44.049 --> 24:47.052
IS THERE A NAME
STILL OUT THERE, OR NO?

24:47.087 --> 24:49.687
THERE IS.
THERE'S AN "M" NAME.

24:49.688 --> 24:56.194
BUT IT'S ALMOST
LIKE EMILY, AMELIA.

24:57.495 --> 24:59.463
AND IF IT'S NOT STARTING
WITH AN "M," IT'S GOT THAT --

24:59.498 --> 25:02.066
YOU NOTICE HOW
IT'S LIKE EMILY.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.901
TEARS, LOOK.

25:04.936 --> 25:07.103
THERE'S A BIGGER STORY.

25:07.104 --> 25:10.725
AND...IT'S GONNA SHED
A WHOLE NEW LIGHT

25:10.760 --> 25:14.346
ON WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THIS RESIDENCE.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.316
OKAY, SO...

25:20.351 --> 25:21.584
THAT'S A LOT OF
INFORMATION.

25:21.619 --> 25:26.757
HE HIT ON A LOT OF THINGS
THAT WE KNEW ABOUT.

25:26.758 --> 25:27.723
YEAH.

25:27.758 --> 25:29.225
WHICH WAS KIND OF CRAZY.

25:29.260 --> 25:31.662
I MEAN, I EXPECT IT FROM HIM,
BUT I DON'T EXPECT IT.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.296
IT'S NOT GUARANTEED
ALWAYS.

25:33.331 --> 25:34.897
SO I'M GLAD HE WAS ABLE
TO HIT ON THINGS

25:34.932 --> 25:37.835
THAT WE'VE ALREADY VERIFIED
AND THINGS THAT WE KNOW.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.071
WE'VE GOT TWO DIFFERENT
THINGS HAPPENING.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.506
WE HAVE THIS ENTITY
THAT MATCHES

25:42.507 --> 25:44.275
THE DESCRIPTION
OF HER GRANDMOTHER.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.542
EXACTLY.

25:45.577 --> 25:47.211
WHEN HE WENT INTO
THE MAIN BEDROOM,

25:47.246 --> 25:48.811
HE DID SAY
A FEMALE CONNECTION.

25:48.846 --> 25:52.216
AND LAST NIGHT, YOU KNOW,
WE DID GET ONE FEMALE EVP.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.517
THAT'S TRUE.

25:53.518 --> 25:55.252
NOW, THE CHILD THING
IS THROWING ME FOR A LOOP

25:55.287 --> 25:56.719
BECAUSE...
- ME TOO.

25:56.754 --> 25:59.256
...I FEEL LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO PROBABLY RESEARCH

25:59.257 --> 26:01.392
AND SEE IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED NEARBY.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.025
YEAH.
WE HAVE A LOT TO GO ON.

26:03.060 --> 26:06.630
I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN CONFIRM
SOME OF THE THINGS HE'S SAYING

26:06.631 --> 26:08.764
AND FIND A NAME FOR THE GIRL.

26:08.799 --> 26:10.902
I'M GONNA START SOME MORE
RESEARCH SO WE CAN MAKE SURE

26:10.937 --> 26:12.735
WE COVER OUR BASES
AND FIND OUT NAMES.

26:12.770 --> 26:15.639
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE
AND SEE WHAT I CAN FIND ONLINE.

26:21.879 --> 26:23.180
WE HAVE SO MUCH RESEARCH TO DO.

26:23.181 --> 26:24.949
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
AND, LIKE, COLLECT THE DEEDS,

26:24.984 --> 26:26.350
FIND OUT WHO LIVED HERE
IN THE HOUSE,

26:26.385 --> 26:27.717
WHO LIVED HERE BEFORE
THEY LIVED HERE,

26:27.718 --> 26:29.052
WHO OWNED THE LAND.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.889
I'M GONNA TRY TO GO BACK
AS FAR AS I CAN.

26:30.924 --> 26:32.055
I'M GONNA SCOUR EVERYTHING.

26:32.056 --> 26:33.223
I'M GONNA LOOK AT
FAMILY HISTORY.

26:33.258 --> 26:36.126
AND I'M GONNA TRY
TO FIND US AN ANSWER.

26:36.161 --> 26:38.995
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS RESEARCH.

26:38.996 --> 26:41.599
AS SOON AS WE START HEARING
THESE THINGS CHIP IS SAYING,

26:41.634 --> 26:44.101
WE INSTANTLY JUST WANNA
OPEN UP OUR COMPUTERS

26:44.136 --> 26:45.402
AND START LOOKING AND --

26:45.437 --> 26:47.670
AND TRYING TO CORRELATE
THIS INFORMATION

26:47.671 --> 26:50.275
WITH ACTUAL PEOPLE
AND EXPERIENCES.

26:52.577 --> 26:55.280
GOD.

27:04.255 --> 27:06.290
I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH LUCK
WITH THE DEEDS.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.426
I WENT THROUGH
THE ANCESTRY STUFF.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.493
AND I CAN'T FIND
ANY KIND OF WEIRD,

27:10.528 --> 27:14.098
LIKE, A DEATH OF A CHILD
AT A YOUNG AGE FROM KRISTY,

27:14.133 --> 27:16.201
DOROTHY, OR ANYBODY ELSE.

27:16.236 --> 27:18.835
I FOUND SOMETHING.

27:18.870 --> 27:22.173
LIKE, SOMETHING WITH A KID?

27:22.208 --> 27:24.274
YEAH.

27:24.309 --> 27:27.477
UM, WELL...

27:27.512 --> 27:30.815
I FOUND SOMETHING
REALLY AWFUL, ACTUALLY.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.484
WHAT? WHAT?

27:32.519 --> 27:34.084
IN THE '80s.

27:34.119 --> 27:37.655
PROBABLY IT'S, LIKE,
A FIVE-MINUTE DRIVE FROM HERE.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.725
UM, THERE WAS
A 31/2-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.761
HER STEPMOTHER PUT HER
IN THE BATHTUB

27:43.796 --> 27:45.562
AND TURNED ON
THE HOT WATER.

27:45.563 --> 27:49.334
AND THE LITTLE GIRL SAID,
"IT BURNS."

27:49.369 --> 27:51.434
AND SHE SAID,
"STAY IN THERE."

27:51.469 --> 27:53.969
AND THE LITTLE GIRL
ENDED UP GETTING, UM,

27:54.004 --> 27:58.075
FIRST- AND THIRD-DEGREE BURNS
OVER HALF HER BODY.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.313
AND, UM, BY THE TIME
THEY TOOK HER

28:03.314 --> 28:05.332
TO THE HOSPITAL
AND EVERYTHING,

28:05.367 --> 28:07.351
SHE DIED
OF CARDIAC ARREST.

28:07.352 --> 28:12.223
AND IT HAPPENED
VERY NEAR HERE.

28:12.258 --> 28:14.591
AND HER NAME WAS AMY.

28:14.592 --> 28:18.430
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

28:18.465 --> 28:20.932
"AMY."

28:26.604 --> 28:29.807
IT HAPPENED
VERY NEAR HERE.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.676
AND HER NAME
WAS AMY.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.996
THE CHILD SUFFERED
FIRST-DEGREE BURNS

28:35.031 --> 28:37.246
OVER 50%
OF HER BODY BELOW HER WAIST

28:37.281 --> 28:41.902
AND THIRD-DEGREE BURNS
OVER 17% OF THE SAME AREA.

28:41.937 --> 28:46.524
SHE DIED OF CARDIAC ARREST
AT 2:25 A.M. THE NEXT DAY.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.891
REMEMBER CHIP WAS SAYING

28:47.892 --> 28:49.894
THE LITTLE GIRL'S NAME
HAD AN IN IT?

28:49.929 --> 28:51.896
HE'S LIKE, "IT'S AN EMILY
OR AN EMMA."

28:51.931 --> 28:53.129
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- YOU KNOW?

28:53.164 --> 28:54.897
I MEAN, HE PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE SAID AMY

28:54.932 --> 28:57.435
BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE.

29:03.974 --> 29:06.277
THERE ARE TWO ENTITIES
WE ARE DEALING WITH --

29:06.312 --> 29:09.180
KRISTY'S GRANDMOTHER
AND THIS LITTLE GIRL, AMY,

29:09.215 --> 29:10.932
WHICH WE WERE ABLE
TO VERIFY TONIGHT.

29:10.967 --> 29:12.649
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT WE TRY

29:12.650 --> 29:14.684
TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM BOTH,

29:14.719 --> 29:18.022
STARTING WITH KRISTY'S
GRANDMOTHER DOROTHY.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.956
SO FAR, IT'S BEEN
REALLY INTERESTING.

29:19.957 --> 29:22.327
WE CAN'T TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED.

29:22.362 --> 29:23.993
YEAH.
WE'VE HAD A FEW THINGS

29:24.028 --> 29:26.030
THAT HAVE PUSHED US
IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.198
- OKAY.
- BUT WE NEED TO DIG DEEPER.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.734
WE BROUGHT IN
A DEAR FRIEND OF OURS

29:29.769 --> 29:31.235
WHO IS A PSYCHIC,
WHO WE TRUST.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.170
HIS NAME IS CHIP COFFEY.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.606
YOU HAVE SOME UNFINISHED
BUSINESS WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

29:35.641 --> 29:38.443
AND CHIP DEALS WITH
A LOT OF THESE CASES.

29:38.478 --> 29:40.143
AND HE'S ALSO BEEN
KNOWN TO CONNECT.

29:40.178 --> 29:42.847
WE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO MEET HIM TONIGHT.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.347
- SHALL WE?
- UM, YEAH.

29:44.382 --> 29:45.833
- IS HE INSIDE?
- HE'S INSIDE RIGHT NOW.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.284
- COOL.
- SHALL WE GO IN AND MEET HIM?

29:47.285 --> 29:50.654
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

29:50.689 --> 29:54.024
KRISTY,
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU

29:54.025 --> 29:55.776
TO MEET MY FRIEND
CHIP COFFEY.

29:55.811 --> 29:57.493
HI, KRISTY.
HOW ARE YOU, DARLIN'?

29:57.528 --> 30:00.147
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU.

30:00.182 --> 30:02.732
WE THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
COULD CHAT WITH KRISTY

30:02.767 --> 30:06.020
AND GIVE US YOUR IMPRESSIONS
OF HER AND HER SITUATION.

30:06.055 --> 30:09.273
WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE MAYBE
SHE CAN GET SOME RESOLUTION.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.707
YOU'VE GOT SOME STUFF
GOING ON IN YOUR HOUSE,

30:10.708 --> 30:12.008
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

30:12.043 --> 30:13.978
ARE YOU, LIKE, WANTING ME
TO TRY TO REACH OUT

30:14.013 --> 30:15.913
AND COMMUNICATE WITH
SOMEBODY WHO'S PASSED?

30:15.948 --> 30:17.682
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

30:24.488 --> 30:27.790
SHE'S ATTACHED
TO THIS HOUSE.

30:27.825 --> 30:29.893
SO SHE LIVED PHYSICALLY
IN THIS HOUSE

30:29.928 --> 30:31.195
OR RESIDED IN THIS HOUSE?

30:40.337 --> 30:44.309
SHE'S A TOUGH COOKIE,
BUT I LIKE HER.

30:44.344 --> 30:47.042
AND...

30:47.077 --> 30:49.245
I FEEL SHE WAS SICK.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.317
I FEEL FLUID-Y IN MY CHEST
WHEN I CONNECT WITH HER.

30:54.284 --> 30:56.853
YOU'RE HER FAVORITE.

30:56.888 --> 30:59.388
AND YOU KINDA KNEW THAT.

30:59.423 --> 31:04.061
AND SHE HOPED YOU KNEW IT,
BUT SHE CAN BE TOUGH.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.598
SHE LOVES YOU.

31:09.133 --> 31:11.367
AND IF SHE SAID
OR DID ANYTHING,

31:11.402 --> 31:15.540
SHE'S COMING BACK
TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

31:15.575 --> 31:17.674
THERE WAS MUTUAL HURT.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.844
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE FELT
HURT ABOUT NECESSARILY.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.245
BUT YOU FELT HURT.
SHE FELT HURT.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.814
EVERYBODY GOT HURT.

31:24.815 --> 31:28.669
BUT SHE SAYS,
"I'M SORRY."

31:28.704 --> 31:32.488
SHE'S GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

31:32.523 --> 31:34.692
SHE'S JUST GONNA TELL YOU
LIKE SHE WOULD TELL IT TO YOU

31:34.727 --> 31:36.060
'CAUSE SHE WOULD
TELL YOU UP FRONT.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.394
SHE WOULD LAY IT
OUT ON THE LINE.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.861
- YEAH.
- AND HERE'S THE DEAL.

31:38.896 --> 31:42.566
SHE'S LIKE, "WHAT MORE DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU?

31:42.601 --> 31:44.366
I'M SORRY.
I LOVE YOU.

31:44.401 --> 31:45.969
YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT."
- OKAY.

31:46.004 --> 31:48.539
"I'M KEEPING AN EYE
ON YOU EVERY NOW AND THEN.

31:48.574 --> 31:52.010
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE REALLY GOOD."

31:52.045 --> 31:55.446
AND SHE WANTS YOU
TO BE, TOO.

31:57.581 --> 32:00.216
MOSTLY WHAT I'M HOLDING
ONTO IS JUST SADNESS

32:00.217 --> 32:02.420
THAT THERE WAS NO CLOSURE.

32:02.455 --> 32:04.920
RIGHT.
THAT'S TOUGH.

32:04.955 --> 32:11.395
BUT AS LONG AS I KNOW THAT
SHE'S NOT STILL ANGRY WITH ME,

32:11.430 --> 32:12.728
YOU KNOW,
AND THAT SHE'S OKAY,

32:12.763 --> 32:15.166
SHE MIGHT EVEN BE HAPPY
THAT I'M HERE WITH MY FAMILY,

32:15.201 --> 32:17.368
THEN THAT...

32:21.439 --> 32:24.308
LIKE, FOR SIX YEARS,
ALMOST EVERY NIGHT,

32:24.343 --> 32:26.444
I, LIKE,
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

32:28.079 --> 32:29.713
BUT, I MEAN, YOU LIVED
WITH THIS EVEN

32:29.748 --> 32:31.348
BEFORE THE SIX YEARS...
- YEAH. RIGHT.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.583
...BECAUSE YOU HAD TO DEAL
WITH

32:32.618 --> 32:33.783
WHEN SHE
WAS STILL ALIVE FOR --

32:33.784 --> 32:35.084
YES. FOR FIVE YEARS
BEFORE THAT.

32:35.119 --> 32:39.456
SO IT'S BEEN 11 YEARS,
AND SO IF THIS GETS YOU

32:39.457 --> 32:41.125
ANY CLOSER TO GETTING AWAY
FROM THAT,

32:41.160 --> 32:43.627
LIKE, WE ARE SO HAPPY
TO DO IT.

32:43.662 --> 32:44.727
I FEEL A LOT BETTER.

32:44.762 --> 32:47.764
I FEEL LIKE
A WEIGHT'S BEEN LIFTED.

32:47.765 --> 32:49.566
I THINK KRISTY GOT
A LOT OF RELIEF

32:49.601 --> 32:51.701
FROM WHAT CHIP HAD TO SAY.

32:51.736 --> 32:54.639
SO I'M SO GLAD CHIP WAS ABLE
TO RELAY THOSE MESSAGES.

32:54.674 --> 32:56.473
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE HERE YET.

32:56.508 --> 32:57.707
I WILL TELL YOU THIS.

32:57.742 --> 33:01.946
THIS, LIKE MANY CASES WE DO,
HAS TURNED INTO, UM,

33:01.981 --> 33:04.747
A LOT MORE LAYERS
THAN WE EXPECTED.

33:04.748 --> 33:05.850
WELL, WE STILL
HAVE WORK TO DO.

33:05.885 --> 33:06.949
I KNOW.
WE ARE NOT DONE.

33:06.984 --> 33:08.417
WE HAVE MORE
INVESTIGATING TO DO.

33:08.452 --> 33:09.853
WE'D LOVE FOR YOU TO INVESTIGATE
WITH US FOR A LITTLE BIT.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.087
I'M ON BOARD.

33:11.122 --> 33:13.857
AND THEN YOU CAN GET BACK
TO YOUR FAMILY

33:13.892 --> 33:15.024
AND RELAX...
- OKAY.

33:15.059 --> 33:17.293
- ...AND SLEEP TONIGHT.
- YEAH.

33:17.294 --> 33:19.980
WE HAVE SO MANY
MORE PIECES TO UNCOVER.

33:20.015 --> 33:22.631
I WANNA REALLY FOCUS
ON WHAT CHIP HAS LED US TO,

33:22.666 --> 33:25.668
INVESTIGATE THIS LITTLE-GIRL
ENTITY THAT HE'S DETECTING.

33:25.669 --> 33:27.436
SO I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY
GO IN THE BASEMENT

33:27.471 --> 33:30.408
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
HE REGISTERED HER THE STRONGEST

33:30.443 --> 33:32.708
AND JUST REALLY TRY
TO SPEAK WITH HER.

33:32.709 --> 33:34.343
HIS NAME IS BooBuddy.

33:34.378 --> 33:37.247
SO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW
WHAT HE DOES,

33:37.248 --> 33:41.285
HE, UM, IS AN EMF DETECTOR,
A TEMPERATURE SENSOR.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.854
AND HE'S A VIBRATION
SENSOR.

33:42.889 --> 33:44.353
IF THE TEMPERATURE CHANGES,

33:44.388 --> 33:46.121
IT'LL SAY, "
IT'S GETTING WARM IN HERE."

33:46.156 --> 33:49.158
IF IT GETS TOUCHED AND FEELS
ANY SORT OF MOVEMENT,

33:49.159 --> 33:52.112
IT'LL SAY,
"THAT TICKLES."

33:52.147 --> 33:54.307
AND IT ALSO
ASKS EVP QUESTIONS.

33:54.342 --> 33:56.467
ARE YOU GONNA START
RECORDING IT?

33:58.636 --> 34:00.303
YOU CAME THROUGH HERE TODAY

34:00.304 --> 34:04.909
AND TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU SENSED
A CHILDLIKE PRESENCE.

34:04.944 --> 34:06.911
- AMELIA, EMILY...
- YEAH.

34:06.946 --> 34:09.297
AND YOU SAID
IT HAS AN "M."

34:09.331 --> 34:11.614
WE WERE DOING
THE SPIRIT BOX.

34:11.649 --> 34:13.750
AND I SAID, YOU KNOW,
"WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"

34:13.784 --> 34:16.318
AND THEN --
AND SHE GOT "AMY."

34:16.353 --> 34:18.989
I WAS ABLE TO DIG UP
A STORY THAT HAPPENED.

34:19.024 --> 34:20.523
IT WAS MAYBE
A MILE AWAY.

34:20.558 --> 34:24.094
IN THE EARLY '80s,
THIS LITTLE GIRL,

34:24.129 --> 34:26.263
UM, HER NAME WAS AMY.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.098
SHE WAS 31/2.

34:28.099 --> 34:31.085
AND HER STEPMOTHER
PUT HER IN THE BATH.

34:31.120 --> 34:34.071
AND AMY SAID,
"THE WATER'S TOO HOT."

34:34.072 --> 34:35.706
AND SHE SAID,
"YOU STAY IN THAT WATER."

34:37.206 --> 34:39.475
THE WATER WAS 138 DEGREES.

34:39.476 --> 34:43.580
AND SHE SUFFERED BURNS
TO OVER HALF HER BODY

34:43.614 --> 34:45.213
AND WAS TAKEN
TO THE HOSPITAL

34:45.248 --> 34:49.284
AND WENT INTO CARDIAC
ARREST AND DIED.

34:49.286 --> 34:50.938
AND I JUST KEEP THINKING
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

34:50.973 --> 34:52.590
OF THAT POOR LITTLE GIRL
GETTING IN THE TUB

34:52.625 --> 34:54.056
AND SAYING,
"IT'S TOO HOT"

34:54.091 --> 34:56.525
AND THEN BEING TOLD
TO STAY THERE,

34:56.560 --> 34:58.495
"YOU DO NOT GET OUT."<i>
- DID YOU MAKE IT WARM IN HERE?</i>

35:10.374 --> 35:12.042
AND I JUST KEEP THINKING
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

35:12.077 --> 35:13.711
OF THAT POOR LITTLE GIRL
GETTING IN THE TUB

35:13.746 --> 35:15.210
AND SAYING,
"IT'S TOO HOT"

35:15.245 --> 35:17.646
AND THEN BEING TOLD
TO STAY THERE,

35:17.681 --> 35:19.316
"YOU DO NOT GET OUT."<i>
- DID YOU MAKE IT WARM IN HERE?</i>

35:21.886 --> 35:24.004
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT HE SAID?

35:24.039 --> 35:26.088
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT HOT WATER.

35:26.123 --> 35:28.058
AND THE BEAR SAYS,
"DID YOU MAKE IT WARM IN HERE?"

35:29.460 --> 35:31.827
IT'S TOO MUCH.

35:31.862 --> 35:35.165
WELL, I THINK THE NEXT STEP
IS TO TALK TO HER.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.636
I'M GONNA START
THIS RECORDER.

35:38.671 --> 35:42.072
IF THERE'S
A LITTLE GIRL HERE,

35:42.107 --> 35:43.639
IF YOUR NAME IS AMY,

35:43.674 --> 35:46.978
CAN YOU COME CLOSE
TO THE STUFF WE PUT OUT?

35:49.479 --> 35:52.982
JUST GRAB ONTO IT
IF YOU CAN.

35:52.983 --> 35:56.185
DON'T BE SHY.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.253
THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE
IN THIS ROOM.

35:58.288 --> 36:01.559
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
AFRAID TO BE HERE WITH US.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.759
AMY, ARE YOU OKAY?

36:03.794 --> 36:06.797
IF YOU'RE OKAY, CAN YOU LIGHT UP
THOSE LIGHTS FOR US?

36:15.106 --> 36:17.139
SHE'S HERE.

36:17.174 --> 36:20.511
THAT, YOU CAN MAKE LIGHT UP,
JUST LIKE THAT.

36:23.147 --> 36:24.782
DID YOU KNOW
THAT HER NAME IS AMY, TOO?

36:24.817 --> 36:26.851
YES. I'M AMY.

36:26.886 --> 36:28.851
ISN'T THAT COOL?

36:28.886 --> 36:30.085
DO YOU LIKE BEING HERE

36:30.120 --> 36:32.522
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER KIDS
TO PLAY WITH?

36:36.760 --> 36:40.529
AMY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO STAY.

36:40.564 --> 36:45.402
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
IN THIS PLACE THAT YOU ARE.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.503
BUT IF YOU WANT TO,
YOU CAN.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.808
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK YOU'VE
BEEN ANY BOTHER TO ANYBODY.

36:50.843 --> 36:54.112
IF YOU WANNA STAY AND PLAY,
YOU DO THAT, TOO.

36:54.147 --> 36:57.582
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF ANYMORE.

36:57.617 --> 37:01.018
NO ONE'S EVER GONNA
HURT YOU EVER AGAIN.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.020
EVER.

37:05.022 --> 37:07.458
BUT YOU DON'T NEED
TO STAY IN THIS PLACE.

37:09.627 --> 37:12.163
OKAY?

37:20.504 --> 37:22.172
I MEAN, I THINK
THE BIGGEST THING

37:22.207 --> 37:23.407
THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED HERE

37:23.442 --> 37:24.608
IS EXACTLY
WHAT KRISTY WANTED,

37:24.643 --> 37:25.674
WHICH IS THE CLOSURE

37:25.709 --> 37:27.376
AND THE MOVING ON
AFTER THE 11 YEARS.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.447
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY
THAT DOROTHY WAS HERE.

37:29.482 --> 37:30.579
YEAH. YEAH.

37:30.614 --> 37:32.316
SHE WAS TRYING TO GET
OUR ATTENTION NIGHT ONE.

37:34.317 --> 37:35.319
****

37:35.354 --> 37:36.751
WHAT WAS THAT?

37:36.786 --> 37:39.490
I MEAN, WE HEARD THE SOUND IN
THE CLOSET IN HER OLD BEDROOM.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.558
AND WE GOT THAT CRAZY
GROWL BACK THERE.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.693
<i> WHAT IS IN THE CLOSET?</i>

37:45.963 --> 37:49.766
AND CHIP WAS ABLE TO CHANNEL HER
AND TALK TO KRISTY.

37:49.801 --> 37:54.737
"WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE REALLY GOOD."

37:54.772 --> 37:58.308
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHATEVER
WAS GOING ON WITH KRISTY

37:58.309 --> 38:01.376
AND HER GRANDMOTHER,
IT FEELS LIGHTER ALREADY.

38:01.411 --> 38:04.415
I FEEL LIKE HER MOMENT WITH CHIP
WAS REALLY WHAT SHE NEEDED.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.747
- RIGHT.
- YOU KNOW?

38:05.782 --> 38:09.152
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THERE'S ALSO THE LITTLE GIRL.

38:09.187 --> 38:12.523
BUT THE ACTIVITY IN THE SON'S
ROOM WAS VERY CHILDLIKE.

38:12.558 --> 38:13.789
"STOP!"

38:13.824 --> 38:16.326
AND CHIP FELT HER PRESENCE
AS SOON AS HE GOT HERE.

38:16.361 --> 38:18.794
SOMEWHERE, SOMEHOW,
THERE'S A STORY OF CHILD ABUSE.

38:18.829 --> 38:21.098
AND LAST NIGHT, AFTER WE TOLD
HER SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE SCARED

38:21.133 --> 38:26.403
AND STAY HERE ANYMORE,
THE ACTIVITY STOPPED.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.803
I DO NOT THINK
IT'S HERE ANYMORE.

38:27.804 --> 38:29.040
NO. I DON'T EITHER.

38:34.544 --> 38:37.012
WE CAN TELL YOU
RIGHT OFF THE BAT

38:37.047 --> 38:40.248
THAT WE DEFINITELY
EXPERIENCED ACTIVITY HERE.

38:40.283 --> 38:44.488
AND IT WAS VERY MUCH IN LINE
WITH WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.022
OKAY.

38:46.023 --> 38:48.325
WE WERE DOING AN EVP SESSION
SITTING ON THE COUCH.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.694
SO THIS IS SO INSANE.

38:51.695 --> 38:53.730
<i> WHAT'S YOUR NAME?</i>

38:53.765 --> 38:55.449
<i> WHY ARE YOU HERE?</i>

38:57.169 --> 38:58.868
SILVER.

38:58.903 --> 39:00.936
I GOT GOOSE BUMPS.

39:00.971 --> 39:03.823
THIS WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM
WITH YOU? OKAY.

39:03.858 --> 39:06.641
WHEN I WAS A KID,
RIGHT BESIDE THE COUCH,

39:06.676 --> 39:09.513
LIKE WHERE THE END TABLE IS
CLOSEST TO THE DOOR HERE,

39:09.548 --> 39:13.150
MY GRANDMA HAD A SILVER POT
OR PAN OF SOME --

39:13.185 --> 39:15.770
IT WAS DECORATIVE,
AND IT WAS SILVER.

39:15.805 --> 39:18.264
AND THAT'S WHAT I KEPT
ALL MY CRAYONS IN.

39:18.299 --> 39:20.689
AND I FREQUENTLY WOULD
TAKE IT OUT AND PLAY.

39:20.724 --> 39:24.695
AND, ACTUALLY, THAT WAS ONE
OF THE THINGS THAT I KEPT

39:24.730 --> 39:26.228
- AFTER SHE PASSED AWAY.
- REALLY?

39:26.263 --> 39:26.914
WHERE IS IT?

39:26.949 --> 39:27.530
WELL, I DON'T --

39:27.565 --> 39:30.132
- I THINK I EVENTUALLY ACTUALLY
DID GET RID OF IT. -

39:30.167 --> 39:31.567
I KNOW, BUT I DID KEEP --

39:31.602 --> 39:34.337
'CAUSE IT WAS A BIG CHILDHOOD
CONNECTION OR MEMORY FOR ME.

39:34.338 --> 39:36.003
- IT'S NOT IN THE CLOSET?
- NO.

39:36.038 --> 39:36.038
DADGUMIT.

39:36.073 --> 39:38.173
MAYBE SHE'S LOOKING FOR IT.

39:38.208 --> 39:40.409
AND THAT WAS --
WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT

39:40.444 --> 39:42.613
WHENEVER WE WERE STARTING
TO GO THROUGH THE HOUSE,

39:42.648 --> 39:44.747
I WENT, "AW, THAT WAS MY -- "
AND IT WAS SILVER.

39:44.782 --> 39:48.251
AND IT WAS RIGHT IN THERE.
SO THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I CAN THINK OF.

39:48.286 --> 39:51.221
BUT THAT ONE SOUNDED
VERY FEMALE TO US.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.057
AND DISTINCT.

39:53.092 --> 39:53.222
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

39:53.257 --> 39:54.823
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING.

39:54.858 --> 39:56.224
AS SOON AS IT DID SAY "SILVER",

39:56.259 --> 39:57.711
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING
I THOUGHT OF.

39:57.746 --> 39:59.105
AND IT'S DEFINITELY
A FEMALE VOICE.

39:59.140 --> 40:00.429
I MEAN, THAT WAS
THE FIRST THING.

40:00.464 --> 40:01.965
WE'RE LIKE, "IT'S FEMALE.
WHAT IS IT SAYING?"

40:02.000 --> 40:03.500
WE'RE LIKE, "SILVER?
IT'S SILVER.

40:03.535 --> 40:04.869
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

40:04.904 --> 40:06.067
OKAY.

40:06.102 --> 40:09.456
CHIP DID HIS WALK-THROUGH,
AND HE WENT INTO YOUR ROOM.

40:09.491 --> 40:12.810
HE IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP
ON A FEMALE FIGURE IN THAT ROOM.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.695
HE SAID, "THERE'S
A FEMALE IN HERE,

40:14.730 --> 40:16.289
A VERY STRONG FEMALE
IN THIS ROOM."

40:16.324 --> 40:18.220
AND THEN THE NEXT NIGHT
WITH YOU,

40:18.255 --> 40:20.116
HE WAS ABLE
TO CONNECT WITH HER.

40:20.117 --> 40:22.953
CHIP COMING AND DOING
THAT RECONCILIATION FOR YOU

40:22.988 --> 40:25.755
AND KIND OF HELPING YOU
THROUGH THAT ISSUE,

40:25.790 --> 40:27.323
IT'S REALLY GREAT
THAT WE WERE --

40:27.358 --> 40:29.225
WE WERE ABLE TO KIND
OF CONNECT THOSE -- THAT BRIDGE.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.525
THAT REALLY HELPED ME.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.863
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH THAT,
UM, JUST, YOU KNOW,

40:32.898 --> 40:34.196
SOME OF THE THINGS
HE HAD TO SAY.

40:34.197 --> 40:36.031
AND IT WAS
WHAT I NEEDED.

40:36.066 --> 40:37.866
IT WAS WHAT
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

40:37.867 --> 40:40.170
AND WE DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT

40:40.205 --> 40:42.473
WITH THE SHADOW FIGURES
OR THE NOISES IN THE CLOSET.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.608
THAT WAS JUST HER TRYING
TO TELL YOU A MESSAGE

40:44.643 --> 40:46.842
AND TO GET SOMETHING TO YOU.

40:46.877 --> 40:50.579
UM, AND THEN WE HAVE
THIS OTHER SPIRIT

40:50.614 --> 40:52.883
AND THIS OTHER ENTITY THAT
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

40:52.918 --> 40:56.352
WITH YOU, THE FAMILY,
THE PROPERTY.

40:56.353 --> 41:00.824
CHIP PICKED UP ON THIS,
THIS ENTITY OF A CHILD.

41:00.859 --> 41:03.327
HE SAID THAT IT WAS, LIKE,
AN ABUSE SITUATION

41:03.362 --> 41:05.795
AND THAT SHE WAS REALLY
JUST REALLY LONGING

41:05.830 --> 41:07.429
TO BE ACCEPTED
SOMEWHERE.

41:07.464 --> 41:09.232
LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES
FROM HERE,

41:09.233 --> 41:12.069
THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL.
UM, SHE WAS 31/2.

41:12.104 --> 41:14.035
AND HER NAME WAS AMY.

41:14.070 --> 41:17.207
BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED
WAS HER STEPMOTHER,

41:17.242 --> 41:19.442
PUT HER
IN THE BATHTUB.

41:19.443 --> 41:21.010
IT WAS 138 DEGREES.

41:21.045 --> 41:23.247
AND SHE SAID,
"STAY IN THERE."

41:23.282 --> 41:25.414
IT SCALDED OVER
50% OF HER BODY.

41:25.449 --> 41:27.851
SHE HAD FIRST-
AND THIRD-DEGREE BURNS.

41:27.886 --> 41:30.320
AND THEN THEY TOOK HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.755
AND SHE DIED OF CARDIAC
ARREST THAT NIGHT.

41:32.790 --> 41:33.956
THAT'S HEARTBREAKING.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.894
SHE MAYBE INITIALLY WAS
JUST KIND OF ATTRACTED BY,

41:36.929 --> 41:38.727
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A PARK RIGHT HERE,

41:38.728 --> 41:40.396
THERE'S KIDS,
YOU HAVE KIDS,

41:40.431 --> 41:42.232
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A LOVING MOM.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.135
AND THEN WHEN
SHE SAW US GET HERE

41:44.170 --> 41:47.105
AND KNEW WE COULD TALK
TO THEM,

41:47.140 --> 41:49.507
THAT REALLY KIND
OF EXCITED HER.

41:49.542 --> 41:51.875
WE FEEL
SHE WAS INTERACTING.

41:51.876 --> 41:54.277
AND I BASICALLY JUST HAD
A TALK WITH HER

41:54.312 --> 41:55.644
AND JUST SAID, YOU KNOW,

41:55.679 --> 41:58.115
"YOU CAN GO WHEREVER YOU NEED
TO GO, AND YOU ARE LOVED."

41:58.150 --> 42:01.984
AND WE DON'T THINK
SHE'S PROBABLY HERE ANYMORE.

42:01.985 --> 42:04.254
LIKE, COMFORTING TO KNOW
THAT IT WAS, YOU KNOW,

42:04.289 --> 42:06.457
NOT AGGRESSIVE
OR EVER TRYING TO HURT ANYBODY.

42:06.492 --> 42:07.658
YEAH.

42:12.329 --> 42:14.698
KRISTY IS FINALLY ABLE
TO HAVE THE CLOSURE

42:14.733 --> 42:16.699
SHE'S BEEN LOOKING FOR.

42:16.734 --> 42:18.836
THE GRANDMOTHER IS
WATCHING OVER THEM

42:18.871 --> 42:20.902
AND IS HAPPY THEY ARE HERE.

42:20.937 --> 42:24.307
THANK YOU FOR GIVING US
A LOT OF ANSWERS AND RELIEF.

42:24.342 --> 42:27.677
AND IT FEELS AMAZING THAT
WHILE WE WERE HELPING KRISTY,

42:27.712 --> 42:29.947
WE WERE ABLE TO HELP
A LITTLE GIRL

42:29.982 --> 42:32.182
THAT FELT LIKE SHE HAD
NO PLACE TO GO.
