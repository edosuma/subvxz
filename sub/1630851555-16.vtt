A NETFLIX SERIES

00:15.974 --> 00:16.933
What are you doing?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.685
I need to get out of this house.

00:19.769 --> 00:20.770
Where are you going?

00:22.147 --> 00:24.649
Caridad. Be very careful.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.485
All of you, be careful.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.250
-How are you?
-Better.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.423
With a guy?
Bautista doesn't have a boyfriend.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.843
Well, that's good. Finally.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.680
Maybe it's one of those romances
you don't tell anyone about.

00:56.431 --> 01:00.894
She needs some space.
She's been so paranoid lately.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.520
I don't know.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.066
She said goodbye
as if she didn't want to see us again.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.406
But nobody seems to care.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.878
VALENTINA

01:26.961 --> 01:28.838
Your sister won't stop calling.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.175
I don't want to have to explain.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.775
Where are we going?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.736
Wherever the road takes us.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.531
You're so tense, Ms. Mai.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.450
You need to relax.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.370
Mr. Andrade.

02:01.579 --> 02:02.455
It's noon.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.916
It's 6:00 p.m. in Spain.

02:05.959 --> 02:06.793
Right?

02:13.716 --> 02:14.717
It's strong.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.698
Miguel.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.283
Done.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.827
She was asleep when I handed her over.

02:41.369 --> 02:45.081
If anyone asks,
you're here for a political event.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.917
You took her to the airport.
Is that clear?

02:58.303 --> 02:59.762
Where am I?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.222
What will happen to her?

03:02.307 --> 03:04.100
None of your business, Cabrilla.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.994
TIBURÓN:
PACKAGE DELIVERED.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.966
-Hi, Víctor.
-Good morning.

03:37.050 --> 03:37.884
What's that?

03:38.468 --> 03:41.054
Tools that were cluttering up
the warehouse.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.139
Need a ride to the convent?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.892
No, thanks. I'm going downtown. Good day.

03:45.975 --> 03:46.851
Good day.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.370
She's on her way there.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.253
Okay.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.234
ASTROLOGICAL AND MYSTIC READINGS

05:09.100 --> 05:12.687
My mom didn't like tobacco smoke.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.195
To what do I owe this honor?

05:24.115 --> 05:26.200
These are the exhumation results.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.330
They found traces of…

05:31.581 --> 05:34.125
Of sedatives in Simón's body.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.963
The coroner says…

05:40.715 --> 05:43.092
he probably took them to gather courage.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.221
But I think…

05:48.890 --> 05:50.099
they were given to him.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.603
To kill him easier.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.939
You should've been a writer, Ignacio.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.900
You have a lot of imagination.

05:58.983 --> 06:02.320
Yes, it's something you don't have.

06:04.238 --> 06:08.910
These are the same drugs
they found in my mom's body.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.664
You didn't even bother
to change your method.

06:15.792 --> 06:20.630
I want a divorce and custody of the kids.
And I'll tell the cops if you refuse.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.259
You're a monster, Rogelio!
Who did I marry?

06:26.761 --> 06:29.180
That's enough, Eloísa, calm down.

06:29.263 --> 06:33.893
Stop it. I'll do it. Sit down.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.031
How could you?

06:49.283 --> 06:50.910
It's just business, Eloísa.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.288
It's a shame you don't get it.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.709
-Don't touch me!
-Eloísa.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.629
Enough.

07:14.934 --> 07:15.810
Mom.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.230
What are you doing here, Simón?
Go to your room.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.446
These are not antidepressant medications.

07:27.196 --> 07:33.327
And unless you can explain
why my mom had them, I don't get it.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.371
Your mom had arthritis, Ignacio.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.083
She was in terrible pain.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.546
And the drugs she was taking
caused insomnia.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.467
And the other ones helped her sleep.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.053
Arthritis? Mom never had arthritis.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.265
Yes, she did.
It was diagnosed when you were born.

07:55.725 --> 08:00.605
It happens to some women during pregnancy,
but she didn't want anybody's pity.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.566
Or for you to feel guilty, Ignacio.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.903
So she suffered silently.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.739
It's all in her medical record.

08:19.874 --> 08:23.085
One day you'll fall.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.423
And I have a feeling
it's going to be soon.

08:35.389 --> 08:39.018
I know what you're up to.
I followed you. You lied to me.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.979
No. I didn't tell you or my grandpa,
which is different.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.650
I don't want you involved
in case anything happens.

08:46.150 --> 08:49.070
Do you know what
the sentence is for forging documents?

08:49.654 --> 08:51.322
I won't abandon those women.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.325
My duty as a cop is to report you.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.539
Then I'm lucky you were suspended,
Detective Márquez.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.417
Caridad.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.381
It's all I need to confirm
if Gregorio spoke with my dad.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.552
I'll give it to the cops
after I know what's on here.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.555
Can we trust this guy?

09:23.104 --> 09:26.649
He's an IT expert who's helping me
with an investigation.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.154
Did you think about what I said?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.541
-I need to go.
-Wait, Valentina.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.132
I want to make love to you.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.927
Even if it's just once.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.223
Everything okay?

10:41.307 --> 10:44.560
Everything's fine.
A glass of ice water, please.

10:45.227 --> 10:46.979
I'll tell the server. No alcohol?

10:47.063 --> 10:50.399
Sorry. I thought you were an employee.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.818
I'm the owner.
What part of Spain are you from?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.028
Palma de Mallorca.

10:54.111 --> 10:58.741
May I ask you a question?
How much does a place like this cost?

11:00.117 --> 11:03.913
It's not cheap, I need my clients to order
more than a glass of water.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.874
-Was it whiskey?
-Yes, please.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.881
Whiskey, table three.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.325
What do you think?

11:44.495 --> 11:48.374
She's great.
What genre should we put her in?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.710
-What genre?
-Yes.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.963
Tropical, pop, traditional?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.468
I don't care about the genre.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.890
Take all the time you need.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.643
-You can pick the genre.
-Yeah.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.354
Okay.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.369
You're late
for almost all your shifts, Matilde.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.665
I was writing
and I lost track of time, sorry.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.666
Writing?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.669
Writing songs for a new album.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.130
Maybe even get a new producer.

12:36.213 --> 12:40.676
For them to use you,
and turn you into something you're not.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.637
Dad, they're not all like that.

12:43.721 --> 12:47.141
Do you know
how many girls like you are successful?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.351
One in a million.

12:49.977 --> 12:53.481
The rest sell their souls
and end up being used.

12:54.064 --> 12:59.320
This stage is all you need to be happy.
Trust me.

13:01.113 --> 13:05.075
You know what? Forget everything I said.

13:07.036 --> 13:07.870
Hey.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.793
I don't want
there to be secrets between us.

13:14.919 --> 13:20.591
Don't you think you're the last person
that should ask me not to keep secrets?

13:23.969 --> 13:25.679
Barracuda is in Mexico City.

13:25.763 --> 13:29.225
He texted Tiburón
that the package was delivered.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.351
-The package?
-Yes.

13:30.434 --> 13:33.521
It's interesting because
they always talk about merchandise.

13:33.604 --> 13:36.398
I think it's one woman
being sent to The Aquarium.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.235
I'm sure it's something special.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.195
Could you trace the messages?

13:41.278 --> 13:45.908
No, it's impossible.
They use different apps on each phone.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.372
Could you help me unlock this phone?

13:51.455 --> 13:54.375
I need to extract some data
before handing it to the cops.

13:54.458 --> 13:58.420
Yes, it'll take longer
if you don't want any trace in the system.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.214
But sure, I can do it.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.632
I'll leave it here.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.009
-See you.
-Okay.

14:11.475 --> 14:12.935
How are you?

14:13.018 --> 14:15.104
A whiskey, thanks.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.898
-Camilo!
-Benny.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.567
-Dude.
-How are you?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.527
-Long time no see.
-I know.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.531
-Are you with the prosecutor?
-I don't work for him anymore, I'm alone.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.369
I heard Manny's back.

14:30.452 --> 14:33.289
Yes, she's back, but now she's the owner.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.709
-Where is she?
-Doing a private dance.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.421
A leopard doesn't change its spots.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.048
-Benny.
-Coming.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.885
Have a drink. Take care of him, man.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.181
Your mom's a fucking leopard.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.852
-Thanks.
-Enjoy.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.003
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.173
-What the hell, man!
-Sorry.

15:32.681 --> 15:33.974
What was it you said?

15:36.393 --> 15:41.065
That now you only get naked
for whoever you want, right?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.759
Why was Camilo here?

16:11.512 --> 16:12.596
He came to see me.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.229
You and him…

16:35.619 --> 16:38.205
Things have changed
between my sisters and I, Aunt.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.001
It's as if
we don't trust each other anymore.

16:46.714 --> 16:52.553
MISSING
THE AQUARIUM

16:52.636 --> 16:54.513
Any news about Bautista?

16:55.180 --> 16:59.351
No, her phone is off
and I can't leave a message.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.980
I'm worried, Aunt.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.442
Relax. I'm sure she's fine.

17:08.027 --> 17:08.861
Somebody.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.699
Please let me out.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.371
Hi. Leave your message.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.364
Where are you, Bautista?

18:05.584 --> 18:08.253
What is this place?
What have you done to me?

18:10.464 --> 18:11.673
Where is Miguel?

18:13.675 --> 18:15.135
You really don't know?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.432
You're at a place called The Aquarium.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.977
No one enters or leaves here
without permission.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.814
That Miguel guy brought you here.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.567
My kidnapper said his name was Lucas.

18:35.030 --> 18:38.075
Sorry, when I changed your clothes
the other night,

18:38.158 --> 18:40.160
I didn't think you were new here.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.170
Yours is on your butt.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.927
But mine is a birthmark.

19:01.890 --> 19:06.270
I don't believe in coincidences.
Fate made us roommates.

19:07.563 --> 19:11.567
We were meant to meet each other.
What's your name?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.614
I am Ana Valencia.

19:37.092 --> 19:37.926
Hi.

19:40.721 --> 19:44.224
Arturo, can you go check
the boxes in the cellar? Thanks.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.142
Thanks.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.521
Have you told Federico?

19:53.817 --> 19:56.236
Camilo, what you saw at the club is not…

19:56.320 --> 19:59.156
It's not what it seems? I think it is.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.325
It was a game.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.120
A game that went too far.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.956
I just…

20:09.666 --> 20:12.628
I didn't know there was something
between you guys.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.302
If you ask Manny,
she'll say there's nothing between us.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.555
So, you don't have to explain anything.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.351
I'm sorry. I really am.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.313
You know what? I'm not.

20:31.396 --> 20:37.361
Maybe I needed this to realize
that love isn't about taking leftovers.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.988
Or being anybody's second choice.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.951
I don't deserve that.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.747
I didn't tell Federico
because you don't deserve that either.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.252
Thanks.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.637
You look beautiful. Let's fix this.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.264
That's it.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.227
One more.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.356
Hold on.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.235
I'll go change the filters
for some more pictures.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.903
No. No more pictures.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.197
Send me the bill, okay?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.740
-Okay.
-Matilde.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.539
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.374
Héctor.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.793
I've been here eight months.

21:35.544 --> 21:39.298
But the deal
to sell me abroad collapsed three times.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.341
I've been lucky.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.720
The majority leave after six months.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.392
Are we near Mexico City?

21:51.226 --> 21:52.144
Nobody knows.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.731
We're brought here
unconscious or blindfolded.

21:55.814 --> 22:00.444
Think of it like a fort filled with gold
that nobody can know about.

22:02.279 --> 22:07.326
Some very important people are involved.
Politicians, famous actors.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.411
Even royalty.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.082
That's Ángel. He's not bad.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.836
The other day I convinced him
to let me use a computer

22:17.919 --> 22:20.130
to send my brother a coded message.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.841
I hope he understood it.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.740
No! Óscar!

22:48.075 --> 22:48.909
What?

22:52.579 --> 22:53.789
Óscar is here.

22:56.833 --> 23:00.462
I'm psychic.
Sometimes the dead speak to me.

23:02.964 --> 23:06.468
Your brother's watching you.
He knows what you do.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.853
-What's going on?
-Come. It's a VIP client.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.231
Come. It's okay.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.385
MATILDE
12 PHOTOS RECEIVED

23:52.180 --> 23:54.516
MESSAGES DELETED

24:06.903 --> 24:07.737
Manny.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.449
It's that Spaniard again.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.702
Let's go.

24:23.378 --> 24:27.591
You come here nearly every day,
have one drink, ask my girls questions.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.427
Why don't you tell me who you are?

24:30.510 --> 24:34.097
Calm down. I'm Carlos Sánchez.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.642
I had to leave Spain
because I had problems with some guys.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.312
I'm here to buy a place just like this.

24:40.395 --> 24:41.354
That was my business.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.356
-It's not for sale.
-Well…

24:44.900 --> 24:46.485
Everybody has a price.

24:46.568 --> 24:50.697
And these types of clubs always owe money
to very impatient people.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.115
We're debt-free.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.159
So, your daddy's rich?

24:55.368 --> 24:57.204
Flaco, a whiskey.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.835
A shot of tequila. Thanks.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.128
Who's with Manny?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.089
I asked who is that?

25:09.841 --> 25:10.926
An admirer.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.428
He's here almost every night.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.890
He can't take his eyes off your heartache.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.326
Can you grab him a drink?

25:37.661 --> 25:38.745
Thank you so much.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.054
"Impermar Ltd."

25:56.721 --> 25:58.848
Where have I seen that name before?

26:08.692 --> 26:10.277
The chicks are hot, right?

26:11.403 --> 26:12.654
Especially Manny.

26:13.863 --> 26:16.908
She's the owner. She used to be a dancer.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.034
Seriously?

26:18.577 --> 26:20.495
You should've seen her moves.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.456
-You're friends?
-Friends?

26:24.291 --> 26:25.834
Manny doesn't have friends.

26:29.296 --> 26:33.675
WHERE IS DOMINGA HEREDIA?

26:37.929 --> 26:39.889
I'M THE DAUGHTER OF A SECRET

26:42.475 --> 26:43.643
Thanks.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.984
-What's up?
-Take it easy.

26:51.067 --> 26:54.029
Calm down. I'm here to warn you.

26:55.155 --> 26:58.491
That guy you're talking to
is an Interpol agent.

27:00.285 --> 27:03.955
-Nonsense.
-It's not nonsense, Manny!

27:04.539 --> 27:07.083
I know those guys so well.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.586
I know what kind of questions they ask.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.588
What?

27:14.049 --> 27:16.426
Where did you get the money to buy this?

27:18.428 --> 27:19.763
Was it clean money?

27:22.349 --> 27:24.017
-Of course it was.
-What?

27:25.435 --> 27:26.269
Good.

27:27.937 --> 27:32.400
I hope so for your sake.

27:33.443 --> 27:36.946
Because that guy's out to get you.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.576
You're wasted.

27:52.462 --> 27:56.299
I want to make love to you
even if it's just once.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.651
Leave your message.

28:16.403 --> 28:19.489
See you Thursday
at the Urbano Hotel at 9:00, Federico.

28:44.139 --> 28:48.643
The girls on this side are pampered
like prize animals to be sold abroad.

28:49.936 --> 28:53.565
They treat the other girls like slaves
for VIP clients.

28:56.192 --> 28:59.612
I heard they're kept drugged
so that they're always ready.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.367
This is Hell disguised as Heaven.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.956
How long does a VIP client stay?

29:11.583 --> 29:12.959
Two or three days.

29:16.963 --> 29:17.881
Why?

29:19.090 --> 29:21.176
Have you thought of an escape plan?

29:21.801 --> 29:26.473
I'm willing to do anything.
Just tell me what you need.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.852
I need to make Ángel believe me.

29:32.645 --> 29:35.273
The EP, or whatever it's called, is done.

29:35.899 --> 29:39.360
We're ready to go whenever,
and the article is a bombshell.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.489
Enough to revive your career?

29:45.033 --> 29:46.409
My career isn't dead.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.913
The media
simply didn't appreciate my work.

29:50.789 --> 29:55.335
And it always seemed weird
that Dominga vanished into thin air

29:56.169 --> 29:59.255
just before becoming a celebrity.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.925
And not a single reporter was interested.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.885
You were almost obsessed.

30:05.386 --> 30:09.432
Eleven articles about the same topic
in four years.

30:11.392 --> 30:14.938
What can I say?
Such a beautiful, talented woman.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.818
It's hard to believe she's a man now.

30:21.903 --> 30:24.823
And you, Mr. Marroquín…

30:27.075 --> 30:31.371
Is it an obsession or payback?

30:31.454 --> 30:32.288
Careful.

30:33.498 --> 30:36.042
I'm not part of your damn article.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.127
Never mind.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.088
Excuse me.

30:56.604 --> 30:57.605
Why are you here?

30:58.523 --> 30:59.399
Wow.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.902
Can't I have some mezcal
at my sister's bar?

31:04.863 --> 31:07.323
I have a date tonight.
I don't want to be at home.

31:08.533 --> 31:12.078
-I thought maybe…
-I came to spy on you?

31:14.247 --> 31:16.666
I don't know what living together
is doing to us.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.293
Me neither.

31:19.794 --> 31:23.715
I don't know.
Sometimes I feel I'm being watched.

31:26.509 --> 31:29.137
Who is it this time? Another Tinder guy?

31:30.930 --> 31:33.558
Don't end up like me and Pocho.
You hear me?

31:34.934 --> 31:37.562
Can you believe
he signed the divorce papers?

31:38.438 --> 31:42.525
He refused for three months.
Suddenly it's in my mail and I'm free.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.235
That's such great news.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.737
Finally.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.033
Is someone coming?

31:53.202 --> 31:54.579
Jordi. I don't know.

31:55.288 --> 31:58.207
He's been coming every day,
then he didn't all of a sudden.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.085
I'd phone him if I had his number.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.339
I don't have it either.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.925
-Oh!
-Really. He changes it every week.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.260
What a scaredy-cat.

32:10.011 --> 32:13.056
But I have his address.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.940
The hotel thing is done.

32:24.233 --> 32:27.153
So, why the long face?

32:28.571 --> 32:30.949
Boss, it's not Federico's fault.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.993
He knows Valentina is his sister.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.287
He deserves it.

32:37.038 --> 32:40.166
You've spent so much money and effort.
Even a knife in the stomach.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.503
Isn't it easier
to make the girls disappear?

32:44.128 --> 32:44.963
Sure.

32:46.297 --> 32:50.093
It's also easier to put together
a 500-piece puzzle

32:51.511 --> 32:52.971
than one of 3,000 pieces.

32:54.889 --> 32:55.807
But easy…

32:57.517 --> 32:58.893
isn't fun.

33:01.980 --> 33:02.981
I know that…

33:04.315 --> 33:08.027
simple-minded people like you
wouldn't understand.

33:26.379 --> 33:30.216
-How do you know where I live?
-Valentina gave me your address.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.971
Claudio's working the night shift
so I could bring you this.

33:39.308 --> 33:42.770
I wanted to thank you
for all you did for me and Daniel.

33:45.356 --> 33:48.943
Thanks, but it wasn't necessary.

33:51.904 --> 33:56.200
Okay, well then, excuse me. Enjoy. Thanks.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.413
I'm an idiot.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.707
"It wasn't necessary."

34:06.461 --> 34:07.712
Let's try again.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.759
Why haven't you come back to the bar?

34:15.803 --> 34:20.224
You made me think you liked me.
Was it just a game?

34:20.308 --> 34:23.019
Of course not. I do like you.

34:25.605 --> 34:26.773
I adore you.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.443
But you said
you're not looking for romance,

34:31.402 --> 34:33.738
I didn't want you to feel harassed,
that's all.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.909
You were just giving me some space?

34:37.992 --> 34:39.911
Some space, that's right.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.247
Can we share the cake?

34:43.331 --> 34:46.709
Sure we can. Come in.

34:52.548 --> 34:55.176
So you've got a music agent?

34:55.259 --> 34:58.721
Yes, but it's a secret
until it's a done deal.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.431
Who is he? What's his name?

35:02.308 --> 35:06.479
I won't tell you because
you'll look for him on the internet.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.231
-On the internet?
-Yes.

35:08.856 --> 35:10.942
Is he trustworthy?

35:12.568 --> 35:16.989
A well-connected person recommended him,
and I have no reason to mistrust them.

35:20.409 --> 35:23.079
You don't need to protect me, Jordi.

35:24.705 --> 35:25.623
Sure.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.923
I want to take it slow, okay?

36:17.508 --> 36:19.802
Sure. There's no hurry.

36:29.437 --> 36:30.646
-Hi.
-Good evening.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.440
I have a reservation, please.

36:44.410 --> 36:46.245
-Hi.
-Hello.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.206
I just saw you dancing.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.250
Are you in Cancún for a vacation?

37:03.262 --> 37:04.513
-My name is…
-No.

37:06.015 --> 37:06.933
No names.

37:10.519 --> 37:13.147
This is probably
the last time we'll see each other.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.902
Let's leave it up to fate.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.679
