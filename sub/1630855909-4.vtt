00:09.175 --> 00:11.261
Who’s ready for rick’s famous spaghetti?

00:12.595 --> 00:14.764
- I love Spaghetti Thursdays!
- Oh my god Rick,

00:14.764 --> 00:17.684
- it’s like it’s better every time.
- Hell yeah, you like that?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.352
That’s... a some good spaghetti!

00:19.352 --> 00:21.604
Grandpa Rick,
I’m skull emoji but words.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.065
Sauce? More sauce?
We gots the sauce.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.025
Dad, you had a job interview, right?

00:26.025 --> 00:29.529
Bombed it. But it’s nothing
a little bolognese won’t cure.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.448
<i>Dad, this noodle is so tender.</i>

00:31.448 --> 00:34.951
A little spicy, a little sweet.
A little spicy, a little sweet.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.202
It’s so nice that we’re talking,

00:36.202 --> 00:38.955
you know, all talking because
we’re a family and everything,

00:38.955 --> 00:40.248
and this a good time we’re having.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.667
- Is there any more?
- Seconds? Thirds?

00:42.667 --> 00:45.295
We spa-gots as much as you can spag-eat!

00:46.379 --> 00:49.090
Rick, I gotta know, like,
what’s the secret ingredient?

00:49.424 --> 00:51.760
God no. Why?
Why? No.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.096
Why is it always this shit with you?
Of course it’s a person.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.890
Rick, why couldn’t it just be spaghetti?

01:31.257 --> 01:33.218
I’m just going to say this
as simply as possible

01:33.218 --> 01:35.136
and let you not believe me,
on this planet,

01:35.136 --> 01:37.138
people that kill themselves
turn into spaghetti.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.432
- What?
- I know, you’re a visual learner,

01:39.432 --> 01:40.475
so follow me.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.897
Hi, Doctor Hotpenis,
you’re not supposed to bring patients...

01:45.897 --> 01:49.567
Hi, Michael, it’s okay,
this alien boy has space cancer

01:49.567 --> 01:52.904
and his dying wish is to see
deader people so he can feel superior.

01:52.904 --> 01:53.905
All you had to say.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.866
Check it out. Murdered.

01:56.866 --> 01:57.867
Gross.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.702
Car crash.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.373
- And suicide.
- Rick, I don’t...

02:04.123 --> 02:06.000
Wait, what is that smell?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.461
You know god damn well what it is, baby.
Get in here.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.671
Don’t do that!

02:09.671 --> 02:11.798
You’ve been doing it for weeks
every spaghetti night.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.383
Come on, Morty.
Choo choo plane!

02:13.383 --> 02:14.467
- Gross.
- Come on!

02:15.552 --> 02:17.720
- God damn.
- Telling you.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.805
Why? How?

02:18.805 --> 02:21.558
Their cortisol increases the starch
content in their bloodstream,

02:21.558 --> 02:24.060
changing their intestines
into one long spaghetti noodle,

02:24.060 --> 02:26.729
and the surrounding tissues into a spicy
sweet hematoma

02:26.729 --> 02:28.106
that we would call a bolognese.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.068
But it takes a lot of cortisol.
Like a suicidal amount.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.403
It’s almost better cold.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.196
Wouldn’t go that far,
don’t be a hipster.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.197
Excuse me.

02:36.531 --> 02:40.159
- Are you two eating a corpse?
- It’s okay! It’s spaghetti.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.495
- Morty, they don’t know what that is.
- I’m calling the police!

02:42.495 --> 02:44.414
- Before you do that, just...
- No, Rick, stop!

02:44.831 --> 02:47.542
- What? Where am I?
- In a morgue, eating bodies.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.085
- We’re what?
- Stop using that thing!

02:49.085 --> 02:50.295
What thing? Who are we?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.255
- We were just leaving.
- All you had to say.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.466
Whose car is this?
Whose sun visor is this? What’s a sun?

02:56.509 --> 02:59.095
Jesus, sorry,
that’s always embarrassing.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.514
But you see what I mean now?

03:01.514 --> 03:04.183
Best spaghetti in the galaxy
and it’s a hundred percent guilt-free.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.476
I wanna know their names.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.437
Who? Michael?
Coroner Number One?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.480
The people we’ve been eating
every spaghetti night!

03:09.480 --> 03:10.815
Do you even know their names?

03:10.815 --> 03:12.775
I’m not giving you
your spaghettises’ names!

03:13.151 --> 03:15.278
You’ve found my line, Morty,
I find that ghoulish.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.489
I want their names or I’m
telling Mom and no more spaghetti night.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.867
You suck! Where’s the thing?
Where’s the Men in Black thing?

03:20.867 --> 03:21.659
Names!

03:21.659 --> 03:24.078
And if you know the fucking
names of your spaghettis, that’s it?

03:24.078 --> 03:25.455
- This is done?
- It’s all I ask!

03:25.455 --> 03:27.332
You won’t get overwhelmed
with even more guilt

03:27.332 --> 03:28.875
and then demand to go
to their fucking funeral?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.126
Just their names and then I’m done.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.461
I promise.

03:33.171 --> 03:36.132
- I fucking hate you.
- I just want to pay my respects.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.717
The only reason you’re still alive

03:37.717 --> 03:39.969
is because you don’t turn delicious
when you die.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.851
Thank you for that moment of silence.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.562
I’d like to open it up to
the congregation,

03:49.562 --> 03:52.440
if anyone would like to say
a few words about Lawrence...

03:58.947 --> 04:01.574
Or another moment of silence.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.284
Jeez, no wonder he killed himself.

04:03.826 --> 04:04.744
Okay let’s...

04:05.787 --> 04:06.829
- For...
- Hi.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.500
I just want to be honest
about something.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.418
After Lawrence died,

04:12.418 --> 04:13.419
we...

04:14.212 --> 04:15.129
...ate him.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.841
Wait, we’re not...
werewolves or anything,

04:18.841 --> 04:22.762
we come from a planet, where to us,
when you guys kill yourselves,

04:22.762 --> 04:25.139
you turn into what
my planet considers food.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.808
Spaghetti.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.226
It brought us together.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.728
Lawrence. Brought us together.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.481
It just felt wrong
not having anyone know that.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.274
But he was delicious.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.610
I hope that helps make it right.

04:40.154 --> 04:43.032
That should do it, buddy.
Everybody enjoy your closure.

04:45.284 --> 04:47.996
So we were eating people.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.539
I’m afraid so.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.916
They were so... spaghettesque.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.710
Yes, they were.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.212
It’s going to be... hard to...

04:56.212 --> 04:57.964
Hard to put out of your mind, yes,

04:57.964 --> 05:00.383
which is why I thought it best
to keep you all in the dark.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.261
So... Morty ruined spaghetti night.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.179
- Correct.
- Summer, it was people!

05:05.179 --> 05:08.391
It was people, Summer.
Which is disgusting.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.268
And not cool to lie about.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.269
Correct.

05:11.644 --> 05:15.189
But. It should also be noted,
to Morty, that it’s not cool to tattle.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.816
- Dad!
- They were delicious.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.901
- So keep eating them!
- We can’t now!

05:18.901 --> 05:20.278
Because of you!
Sorry.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.031
Morty. That was terrible parenting.

05:23.031 --> 05:26.075
You did the quote unquote right thing.

05:26.075 --> 05:29.370
We are technically very happy
to be better informed.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.997
First octopus, now this.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.459
Have we thought about just giving up and
joining the fascist half of the country?

05:34.459 --> 05:36.669
- No!
- Just saying, they get to do more.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.922
Well, I guess I’ll go to my room
since everyone hates me now.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.094
- Sorry. Good night, Morty.
- Goodnight, Morty.

05:46.679 --> 05:51.142
<i>Hey, big boy. Are you depressed?
Mama likes depression.</i>

05:52.310 --> 05:57.815
<i>I spilled my milk. Now we’re both sad.
I’m a bad family therapist farm girl.</i>

05:59.859 --> 06:04.655
<i>Hello, Morty Smith.
You are invited to 41-Kepler B.</i>

06:04.655 --> 06:06.783
<i>You know it as Spaghetti Planet.</i>

06:07.116 --> 06:09.494
<i>You’re not in trouble.
We just want to talk.</i>

06:10.411 --> 06:12.038
Can that thing support my weight?

06:12.371 --> 06:13.289
<i>It should.</i>

06:14.290 --> 06:15.375
Okay...

06:16.000 --> 06:17.043
...up here?

06:18.336 --> 06:20.296
Geez.
Ever heard of a ramp?

06:20.296 --> 06:21.506
<i>This is a ramp.</i>

06:25.218 --> 06:27.845
Hi, Morty,
I’m the president of this planet.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.764
I saw the video of you at that funeral.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.432
- I’m sorry.
- Don’t be.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.643
It was quite the revelation.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.479
Would you mind showing us?

06:37.146 --> 06:40.650
This is the "spaghetti"
of a person that took their own life.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.401
They did consent to be eaten.

06:43.152 --> 06:44.070
Okay.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.495
Wow, yeah, amazing as always.
Not gonna lie.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.581
And would you consider yourself
a typical Earthian?

06:56.207 --> 07:00.419
Well, on Earth, it’s considered
inferior to be typical so

07:00.419 --> 07:04.382
we’re all very special and different
but we definitely all do like spaghetti.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.843
All eight billion of you.

07:07.510 --> 07:11.097
Morty, how would you feel about
being a kind of ambassador?

07:11.097 --> 07:13.015
A liaison between our worlds.

07:14.058 --> 07:17.103
Now hold on.
I went to that funeral because...

07:17.103 --> 07:20.523
Because you felt bad.
Because you didn’t have permission.

07:20.898 --> 07:21.816
Show him.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.819
<i>My name is Tanya Radcliffe.</i>

07:25.236 --> 07:27.822
<i>I’ve been living in pain for years,</i>

07:27.822 --> 07:31.450
<i>I’ve lost all my loved ones,
I’ve got nothing.</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:36.164
<i>So when doctors told me
I could finally have the "right to die"</i>

07:36.164 --> 07:39.000
<i>if I agree to be dinner
for some alien boy,</i>

07:39.625 --> 07:43.421
<i>I simply said, "I hope I’m delicious."</i>

07:45.006 --> 07:45.923
God damn.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.968
And would you say
that makes it taste better?

07:49.635 --> 07:51.762
It makes it go down a lot easier.

07:51.762 --> 07:52.930
I like that.

07:53.806 --> 07:57.894
Maybe it’s time we allow some people
the right to die and be delicious.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.896
Please feel free to finish Tanya.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.815
- It is what she wanted.
- No. No I think I’m good.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.818
Thanks.
Tanya, you really were tasty.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.949
Actually, can I take her to go?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.911
Who’s ready for more ethical spaghetti?

08:14.911 --> 08:16.746
Me. I love this ethical shit.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.706
Full admission, I was fine before to.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.667
God this is so good!
Pass the Parmesan!

08:21.667 --> 08:24.212
Where’s Dad? Why does he keep
missing spaghetti night?

08:24.212 --> 08:26.464
I guess he got butthurt
because Morty high-roaded him

08:26.464 --> 08:29.842
and got us the delicious spaghetti
without all the lies and nihilism.

08:29.842 --> 08:33.054
And another cheer
for the added bonus of no Rick...

08:33.054 --> 08:34.013
Boom.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.390
Sorry to interrupt Morty’s
perfect spaghetti night,

08:36.390 --> 08:38.893
- but thought he’d wanna see this.
- What the fuck is that?

08:39.435 --> 08:44.148
"Morty-O’s Suicide Spaghetti
is 100% ethical, single-origin pasta."

08:44.482 --> 08:45.608
Oh dear God.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.568
Lemme guess,
you went back to the planet,

08:47.568 --> 08:49.654
gave some thoughtful
insight to their leader,

08:49.654 --> 08:52.073
and now they’re selling
their dead at every Space Walmart.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.283
I did, but I didn’t say to do this.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.285
Is this people, or not people?

08:56.827 --> 08:59.497
I just need to know
how much I should pretend to be upset.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.332
This seems to be ‘Roger.’

09:01.916 --> 09:04.877
<i>Hi. I’m Roger Wayne Marder.
I was a serial killer and cannibal,</i>

09:04.877 --> 09:07.088
<i>and now I get to kill myself
and be food for you,</i>

09:07.088 --> 09:09.632
<i>which I suppose is a silver lining
to all my misdeeds.</i>

09:10.091 --> 09:11.175
<i>Anyway, please enjoy me.</i>

09:13.219 --> 09:14.971
So "yes" to people?

09:15.346 --> 09:17.807
I mean, on the bright side,

09:17.807 --> 09:20.935
I feel like one could look
at this as a really nice epilogue

09:20.935 --> 09:22.645
to a story about telling the truth.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.147
Care to see that epilogue?

09:28.859 --> 09:29.902
What is all this...

09:29.902 --> 09:32.488
Cans of spaghetti selling out
to every neighboring planet.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.699
Wanna go see how ethical
it is down there?

09:36.742 --> 09:38.119
This is Spaghetti Planet?

09:38.536 --> 09:40.162
- What happened?
- You happened.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.456
You happened all over those billboards.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.917
Oh jeez, oh no.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.712
See that, they call that bridge
"The Most Scenic Jump".

09:48.045 --> 09:49.672
There used to be safety rails,

09:49.672 --> 09:52.174
they melted them down
for giant spaghetti strainers.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.678
- You wanna turn on the radio?
- I get it, it’s all Enya.

09:55.678 --> 09:59.140
Nope, all morning Zoo teams.
Just patter. No songs.

09:59.598 --> 10:00.725
Oh and for TV?

10:00.725 --> 10:03.853
Wall-to-wall reality television,
but not the good kind.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.938
It’s like their whole planet
was bought by Discovery.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.857
Jesus Christ, this is depressing.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.692
That’s definitely
what they’re going for.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.945
Look at this shit!
They dyed their sun institutional grey.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.905
That’s not easy, kinda impressed.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.241
And all of it is thanks to.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.494
Oh god. I’m a murderer.

10:21.078 --> 10:24.165
Oh no, Morty.
What you did was much more indirect.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.002
I understand your concerns,
but look around.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.504
With what’s coming
in from intergalactic spaghetti trade,

10:30.504 --> 10:34.050
we’ve decreased our debt,
are making a lot of money.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.428
We’ve got clean energy...

10:37.428 --> 10:40.181
That space where you paused is where you
should have said "mental healthcare."

10:40.181 --> 10:43.100
Alright, we had to put our fingers
on the scale, a little.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.730
But if we stop this, the supply chain
crumbles and kills the global economy.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.940
How many people will suffer then?

10:49.940 --> 10:53.402
Okay, tough problem,
definitely a spicy meat-a-ball.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.488
But we can fix it. Right, Rick?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.032
- You mean me. You want me to fix it.
- A moment?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.326
Yes, I want you to fix it.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.703
None of this would have happened if
you’d been honest about the spaghetti.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.748
Morty, I lied to protect you,
you told the truth to hurt me.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.249
I can’t travel the galaxy with you

11:07.249 --> 11:10.002
if every time we come near a fucked-up
system you leap into its wires

11:10.002 --> 11:11.003
and electrocute yourself.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.463
I promise to stop.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.298
- You what?
- If you help me,

11:14.298 --> 11:16.801
I promise I’ll never look under
the curtain at a Rick thing

11:16.801 --> 11:18.552
to figure out what’s bad about it,
ever again.

11:18.552 --> 11:19.970
And you can never say no to me.

11:20.554 --> 11:21.847
What are you, Keith Raniere?

11:21.847 --> 11:22.932
- For two weeks.
- Fine.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.683
My grandson kissed my ass so I’m in.

11:24.683 --> 11:28.854
Okay, so, w-we just need to figure
out something else besides

11:28.854 --> 11:30.773
people to put in the cans, right?

11:30.773 --> 11:34.068
But people are the spaghetti,
that’s the whole thing.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.736
But what if they weren’t?

11:36.362 --> 11:38.322
- I’m listening.
- Me, too.

11:38.322 --> 11:41.742
I mean,
what if we make something like a person.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.703
Like...
Rick you’re always doing clones, right?

11:44.703 --> 11:46.163
What are you suggesting here?

11:46.163 --> 11:48.624
A sped up lifespan
and indoctrination program?

11:48.624 --> 11:50.126
Limiting their exposure to the world

11:50.126 --> 11:52.628
and convincing them that becoming
spaghetti is their destiny?

11:58.092 --> 12:00.094
I won’t be delicious for them!

12:00.094 --> 12:02.596
I love you, CLONE-5617B!

12:08.060 --> 12:10.438
That was some speed run
of Never Let Me Go.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.564
Spoilers, Rick!

12:11.564 --> 12:14.024
I guess all clone stories turn
out the same way.

12:14.024 --> 12:17.820
So. We’re back to the regular people,
regular suicides?

12:17.820 --> 12:20.030
No, hold on, hold on.
we can do this.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.991
Maybe we make them less...

12:22.450 --> 12:23.409
...people.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.162
How much of a people
do they have to be to become spaghetti?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.456
Grey areas. My specialty.

12:29.081 --> 12:29.999
Subject one.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.626
No frontal lobe, <i>no empathy centers.</i>

12:32.626 --> 12:34.670
<i>Otherwise the same
physiology as a person.</i>

12:36.881 --> 12:39.717
<i>Unfortunately, to this guy there’s
no difference between life and death.</i>

12:40.259 --> 12:41.510
So, no spaghetti.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.053
Then there’s this one.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.848
It’s in horrible, unimaginable pain
from the moment it’s born.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.516
Oh jeez, oh no, Rick!!

12:47.516 --> 12:50.978
And so I didn’t even bother to make it
because I knew you’d take issue.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.063
Even though you’d be doing
it a favor by ending its life.

12:53.063 --> 12:53.856
Fuck you.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.192
You might want to examine that
"Trolley Problem" at some point, Morty.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.776
Anyway, here’s the last one.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.362
Kept the brain stem,
internal motor functions.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.656
But essentially just a headless,
boneless torso.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.784
There’s spaghetti inside that?

13:05.784 --> 13:08.204
Theoretically, yes.
The problem is the...

13:08.704 --> 13:09.622
You know.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.000
Could you, Like.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.046
What is that, what are you,
is this charades?

13:17.046 --> 13:18.714
Okay, are you making a fist?

13:18.714 --> 13:20.466
Wait is that supposed to be a phone?

13:20.799 --> 13:22.426
Ah fuck it, just spell it out for me.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.095
Maybe give them...

13:25.095 --> 13:28.307
...a claw-like, hand so they can,
ya know,

13:28.682 --> 13:31.185
- stab themselves to death?
- All you had to say.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.897
Well, this is some solution
you guys have cooked up.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.215
- Spaghetti!
- Technically.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.258
Good enough for me.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.802
We need to fill hundred thousand
cans by the weekend.

14:04.802 --> 14:08.222
So let’s fire up these chunky boys!

14:09.723 --> 14:12.184
Torso’s rights! Torso’s rights!

14:13.185 --> 14:14.436
The new spaghetti sucks!

14:14.853 --> 14:16.605
We want authentic spaghetti!

14:18.315 --> 14:20.818
- Were you...
- Wait, you’re gonna blow yourself up?

14:20.818 --> 14:22.945
Yeah, but if you wanna do it...

14:22.945 --> 14:25.114
Well, you clearly have
a morally superior position so.

14:25.781 --> 14:26.991
Please. Go ahead.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.785
You just want me to kill myself
so you can eat the spaghetti, right?

14:30.160 --> 14:32.121
- Fucking alien piece of shit...
- Fuck you!

14:32.121 --> 14:33.163
Fuck you!

14:39.044 --> 14:41.880
How long does a society
take to collapse?

14:42.214 --> 14:43.132
Let’s find out.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.093
What’s the fucking hold-up?

14:46.093 --> 14:48.345
I’ve got an entire planet
waiting on delivery.

14:48.345 --> 14:52.099
- They say they’re out of spaghetti.
- Then let’s go down there and make some.

14:55.561 --> 15:01.442
Kill yourself, kill yourself,
kill yourself, kill yourself,

15:03.485 --> 15:06.989
I understand. Divert half of the armed
patrols to civil unrest,

15:06.989 --> 15:08.741
the other half to planetary defense.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.535
Take every action
necessary to restore order.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.787
Still didn’t hear much diverting
towards mental healthcare.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.749
The brainstorming is over,
you ghoulish little corpse-eating alien.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.833
You’ve helped enough.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.879
Fuck. We owe so much spaghetti
to so many planets

15:21.879 --> 15:23.464
that we’re all going to have
to kill ourselves.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.632
Slow down, slow down.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.427
Rick can synthesize anything he gets
a sample of, can’t we still try that?

15:29.053 --> 15:32.806
I mean, is there anyone else left
who might wanna kill themselves?

15:33.307 --> 15:35.559
There’s one, but good luck.

15:36.977 --> 15:37.978
Two months to live.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.564
Bedridden, terrible pain...

15:41.774 --> 15:42.900
Why hasn’t he done it yet?

15:43.317 --> 15:45.027
- Hey!
- Fuck you, spaghetti child!

15:45.027 --> 15:46.403
- What gives?
- I’m in pain...

15:47.655 --> 15:48.906
...and I wish I could die.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.867
But I won’t feed your
sick system of profit.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.453
Integrity means living with pain.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.790
What if I told you this would
end the spaghetti trade forever?

15:59.541 --> 16:01.335
- What do you mean?
- I’ll explain on the way.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.888
Did you have a, like a...
euthanasia chamber ready to go?

16:12.888 --> 16:13.931
It’s just a place.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.187
<i>Hey! Hey!
Everyone Stop! Stop!</i>

16:20.813 --> 16:23.148
<i>I have a solution
to get you all spaghetti.</i>

16:23.148 --> 16:24.858
<i>We’re gonna do this one last time.</i>

16:25.401 --> 16:28.570
This guy here, he’s gonna do the deed
and I’ll synthesize it.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.281
This is the Kitty Hawk
of our Wright Brothers flight,

16:31.281 --> 16:34.034
or the fill-in-the-blank
from your fill-in-the-planet.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.578
Now, Fred?
Just think about your life.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.289
This machine will put it on screen
for everyone to see.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.458
When you’re ready, press the button.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.174
- Do you think this is gonna work?
- Trust me.

17:11.697 --> 17:16.410
<i>Maybe, I don’t really wanna know,</i>

17:16.952 --> 17:19.246
<i>How your garden grows,</i>

17:19.788 --> 17:22.624
<i>Cause I just wanna fly.</i>

17:23.041 --> 17:27.588
<i>Lately, did you ever feel the pain,</i>

17:28.213 --> 17:30.299
<i>In the morning rain,</i>

17:31.008 --> 17:34.303
<i>As it soaks you to the bone?</i>

17:35.053 --> 17:40.350
<i>Maybe I just wanna fly,
Wanna live I don’t wanna die,</i>

17:40.768 --> 17:45.939
<i>Maybe I just wanna breathe,
Maybe I just don't believe,</i>

17:46.356 --> 17:51.653
<i>Maybe you're the same as me,
We see things they'll never see,</i>

17:51.987 --> 17:56.366
<i>You and I are gonna live forever.</i>

17:59.203 --> 18:01.330
<i>I said maybe,</i>

18:02.247 --> 18:04.041
<i>I don't really wanna know,</i>

18:04.917 --> 18:10.547
<i>How your garden grows,
Cause I just wanna fly.</i>

18:11.048 --> 18:18.055
<i>Lately, did you ever feel the pain,
In the morning rain,</i>

18:19.014 --> 18:22.893
<i>As it soaks you to the bone?</i>

18:22.893 --> 18:28.232
<i>Maybe I will never be,
All the things that I wanna be.</i>

18:28.649 --> 18:34.196
<i>Now is not the time to cry,
Now's the time to find out why,</i>

18:34.196 --> 18:39.618
<i>I think you're the same as me,
We see things they'll never see.</i>

18:40.035 --> 18:44.706
<i>You and I are gonna live forever.</i>

18:47.584 --> 18:52.214
<i>Maybe, I don't really wanna know,</i>

18:53.048 --> 18:58.595
<i>How your garden grows,
Cause I just wanna fly.</i>

18:59.012 --> 19:04.309
<i>Lately, did you ever feel the pain,</i>

19:04.309 --> 19:06.562
<i>In the morning rain,</i>

19:07.145 --> 19:10.190
<i>As it soaks you to the bone?</i>

19:10.899 --> 19:16.238
<i>Maybe I just wanna fly,
Wanna live, I don't wanna die,</i>

19:16.655 --> 19:22.244
<i>Maybe I just wanna breathe,
Maybe I just don't believe,</i>

19:22.244 --> 19:27.583
<i>Maybe you're the same as me,
We see things they'll never see,</i>

19:28.000 --> 19:31.962
<i>You and I are gonna live forever,</i>

19:34.673 --> 19:37.593
<i>Gonna live forever.</i>

20:01.199 --> 20:02.117
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

20:12.461 --> 20:13.754
Well, fuck.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.008
I think I can speak
on behalf of my people.

20:18.759 --> 20:19.968
We’ve had enough spaghetti.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.387
You did it, didn’t you.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.140
You couldn’t change everyone’s taste,
but you could make it...

20:26.058 --> 20:26.975
distasteful.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.187
- It wasn’t the death, was it?
- It was the complexity of life.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.730
God, what was the point?

20:31.730 --> 20:34.399
If you’re asking whether this was
a story about right and wrong,

20:34.399 --> 20:36.652
the answer is, I don’t care.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.154
- So what do we do?
- Cells consume, Morty.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.657
Life itself is wrong,
and that means death is right.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.241
But you can’t side with that.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.869
So you live, even when it means eating.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.413
And Fred here really did it well.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.339
The hell is this?
Where is the spaghetti?

20:57.339 --> 20:58.882
Why don’t you go fuck yourself, Summer?

20:58.882 --> 21:00.467
- What?
- What’s wrong with Salisbury Steaks?

21:00.467 --> 21:01.468
At least try them.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.261
Holy shit, this is...

21:03.720 --> 21:06.473
the best Salisbury steak I’ve ever had.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.684
Is it actually Salisbury steak?

21:09.434 --> 21:10.894
Do you want to know or not?

21:10.894 --> 21:12.354
No thanks!

21:12.354 --> 21:14.773
Just so you know, it’s really bad.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.776
- Whatever you say.
- Seriously, I’m not kidding.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.487
I won’t tell you but I need you
to know the truth is horrible

21:20.487 --> 21:23.240
so that if you ever find out on accident
you can’t blame me.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.324
Now that’s a deal.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.868
Honestly if you knew
you might kill yourselves,

21:26.868 --> 21:28.870
- that’s the last thing I’ll say forever.
- Good!

22:08.660 --> 22:11.371
<i>Gonna live forever.</i>

22:16.793 --> 22:19.963
That’s where vacuum cleaner bags
come from?

22:19.963 --> 22:21.006
Oh my god.
