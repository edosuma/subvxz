He weaseled around,

knock yourself out.

19:49.249 --> 19:51.516
Let's hear
what you got.

19:51.551 --> 19:55.119
Well, let me first say,
this is incredibly sad.

19:55.154 --> 19:56.821
I mean, i didn't know
lita merrill that well,

19:56.889 --> 19:59.724
but it's hard to believe
she's gone.

19:59.759 --> 20:01.192
But from a mystery standpoint,

20:01.228 --> 20:03.761
there doesn't appear to be
any forced entry.

20:03.796 --> 20:05.763
Were the doors locked,
the windows undisturbed?

20:05.832 --> 20:07.532
All of them.

20:07.567 --> 20:08.433
Did you see the text?

20:08.468 --> 20:09.667
No.

20:09.736 --> 20:11.236
But pamela told me
that lita wrote

20:11.271 --> 20:13.304
she couldn't do this anymore,
she loved everyone,

20:13.340 --> 20:14.472
and goodbye.

20:14.507 --> 20:16.107
And there's your suicide note.

20:16.142 --> 20:18.376
Now, from what i know,

20:18.411 --> 20:21.479
dalton and cassie,
they knocked on the door,

20:21.514 --> 20:22.580
there's no answer,

20:22.616 --> 20:23.548
and they let themselves in.

20:23.583 --> 20:24.782
Wait, they had a key?

20:24.851 --> 20:26.016
Yes.

20:26.052 --> 20:28.219
Cassie has one
for every band member.

20:28.288 --> 20:29.721
So, they entered,

20:29.756 --> 20:31.289
they saw her hanging.

20:31.358 --> 20:33.090
Cassie called 9-1-1,

20:33.159 --> 20:35.660
and then john lifted her down,

20:35.695 --> 20:38.463
and attempted resuscitation.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.731
What's your theory?

20:39.799 --> 20:41.999
She seemed so happy, frank.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.768
She was very excited
about going on tour.

20:43.803 --> 20:45.770
It just doesn't fit.

20:45.838 --> 20:46.638
Well, a lot of people,

20:46.673 --> 20:49.073
you know, troubled people,

20:49.108 --> 20:51.208
they're able to hide
their problems.

20:51.244 --> 20:53.378
I've seen it many times before.

20:53.413 --> 20:55.913
Now what happens?

20:55.948 --> 20:56.914
Wait for the coroner's report,

20:56.949 --> 20:59.584
and if all
is as it seems, then...

20:59.653 --> 21:01.286
it is what it is.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.265
Here you go.

21:14.301 --> 21:15.433
Thank you.

21:18.004 --> 21:19.904
Take-out's in the kitchen.

21:19.972 --> 21:21.472
I thought
you might need italian.

21:21.508 --> 21:23.474
You know me so well.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.176
I'm sorry about your friend.

21:26.613 --> 21:30.147
I keep thinking about
the last time i saw lita.

21:30.216 --> 21:31.248
I don't know what to do

21:31.284 --> 21:33.117
with the stuff
she brought in the store.

21:33.152 --> 21:34.585
Well, it belongs
to the estate,

21:34.621 --> 21:36.253
so someone
can come and claim it,

21:36.289 --> 21:38.756
or you can bring it
to the police.

21:38.825 --> 21:40.325
Does she have family here?

21:40.360 --> 21:41.459
I don't know.

21:41.494 --> 21:43.628
I really don't know
that much about her.

21:44.664 --> 21:46.297
We are lucky.

21:46.333 --> 21:48.032
We have each other,

21:48.100 --> 21:49.567
we have two great kids.

21:49.602 --> 21:50.401
Life is good.

21:50.437 --> 21:52.503
Life is good.

21:52.539 --> 21:53.938
But as for the two great kids...

21:53.973 --> 21:55.005
[chuckles]

21:55.074 --> 21:56.774
right now,
i'm thinking only one.

21:56.810 --> 21:59.711
Hannah is causing me
so much grief at work.

21:59.779 --> 22:00.911
Actually, not hannah,
my daughter,

22:00.947 --> 22:02.647
because no one knows
it's my daughter

22:02.716 --> 22:05.416
who's working against
my company's biggest project.

22:06.619 --> 22:08.820
It'll be okay.

22:08.888 --> 22:10.087
I'll, uh, get you the food.

22:10.122 --> 22:11.556
Thanks.

22:15.294 --> 22:17.829
[♪♪♪]

22:17.864 --> 22:20.197
it's horrible.
I can't believe it.

22:20.266 --> 22:21.232
I knew something
was wrong

22:21.267 --> 22:22.367
the minute everyone
came on stage

22:22.402 --> 22:23.835
with their cell phones.

22:23.870 --> 22:25.236
You could see
from their faces,

22:25.304 --> 22:26.804
the band was
just devastated.

22:28.575 --> 22:30.842
Where's your sister?

22:30.877 --> 22:33.277
Um, she's back at the hotel.

22:33.312 --> 22:34.178
She got theatre tickets.

22:34.247 --> 22:35.413
We're going later.

22:35.448 --> 22:37.415
Oh, i thought she wanted
to work in the store.

22:37.450 --> 22:38.416
Oh, she does.

22:38.485 --> 22:39.851
She's working up to it.

22:42.054 --> 22:43.287
What are you reading?

22:43.356 --> 22:45.456
Oh, just a little
agatha christie.

22:45.492 --> 22:46.791
Oh, no.

22:46.826 --> 22:48.393
What?

22:48.428 --> 22:50.094
You're doing it again.

22:50.129 --> 22:51.562
Doing what?

22:51.631 --> 22:54.265
I'm just reading
a little mystery book.

22:54.300 --> 22:57.769
Oh, yes, and my sister's here
because she misses me.

22:57.837 --> 23:00.438
Solve that mystery.

23:16.523 --> 23:17.722
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

23:17.757 --> 23:19.189
Uh, are you going?

23:19.225 --> 23:20.425
- I was going to talk to you.
- Yeah, i've got study group.

23:20.460 --> 23:21.292
Um, not sure
when i'll be back,

23:21.327 --> 23:22.259
but we'll talk.

23:22.295 --> 23:23.227
Okay.

23:28.968 --> 23:31.803
I talked to hannah
about the hatcher building.

23:31.838 --> 23:34.906
That building has no
historical significance.

23:34.941 --> 23:36.841
I mean, it looks good
on the outside,

23:36.876 --> 23:38.142
but the inside
is completely rotting.

23:38.177 --> 23:39.710
She's pretty passionate
about it,

23:39.746 --> 23:41.746
and isn't that
how we raised her,

23:41.781 --> 23:43.113
to fight for what
she believes in?

23:43.182 --> 23:45.716
Well, why couldn't she be
passionate about new condos?

23:45.785 --> 23:47.284
[Chuckles]

23:47.320 --> 23:49.887
[♪♪♪]

23:53.760 --> 23:55.426
the show's been
rescheduled.

23:55.462 --> 23:57.027
It'll be
a tribute to lita.

23:57.063 --> 23:59.597
I have tickets,
if you're still interested.

23:59.632 --> 24:00.565
Well, i am.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.599
Thank you.

24:01.634 --> 24:02.867
How's john?

24:02.902 --> 24:05.436
It's been rough.

24:05.472 --> 24:08.873
He kind of withdrew into himself
for a few days.

24:08.908 --> 24:11.843
It was so traumatic.

24:11.878 --> 24:14.244
He had no clue lita was
going through anything.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.580
I guess sometimes

24:15.615 --> 24:17.147
it's hard
to see the signs.

24:17.183 --> 24:18.148
Actually,

24:18.184 --> 24:19.350
our manager noticed

24:19.418 --> 24:21.452
she seemed a little out of it
at rehearsal.

24:21.488 --> 24:23.187
But...

24:23.222 --> 24:24.989
poor john.

24:25.024 --> 24:26.958
He's never been good
around death,

24:26.993 --> 24:28.359
and he walks in--

24:28.394 --> 24:30.027
thought she might
still be alive.

24:30.062 --> 24:31.061
He performed cpr

24:31.130 --> 24:33.297
until the ambulance guys
arrived.

24:33.332 --> 24:34.932
Really freaked him out.

24:34.968 --> 24:36.567
I'm sorry.

24:36.603 --> 24:38.102
Thank you.

24:38.137 --> 24:40.805
It'll take time, but...
we'll get through it.

24:44.343 --> 24:46.276
Okay, you're not going
to like what i'm thinking.

24:46.312 --> 24:48.212
I already don't like it.

24:48.247 --> 24:50.381
I have a pretty good
sense about people,

24:50.416 --> 24:51.549
you grant me that, right?

24:51.618 --> 24:53.484
Okay, granted.

24:53.553 --> 24:55.252
I told you that lita
came into the store

24:55.287 --> 24:56.654
before all this happened?

24:56.689 --> 24:57.989
I know.

24:58.024 --> 24:59.189
She brought some things in
to sell on consignment.

24:59.258 --> 25:00.825
Yes.

25:00.860 --> 25:03.327
That's not what a seriously
depressed person does.

25:03.362 --> 25:05.930
I just didn't get
that feeling from her.

25:05.965 --> 25:07.464
So..?

25:09.002 --> 25:11.101
So, this reminds me
of an agatha christie mystery,

25:11.137 --> 25:13.470
where there was
a staged suicide.

25:14.641 --> 25:15.873
Go ahead.

25:15.909 --> 25:16.874
I don't know
that lita merrill

25:16.910 --> 25:18.976
even kicked that chair over.

25:19.012 --> 25:20.277
Is it possible

25:20.312 --> 25:22.246
that someone tied that rope
over the beam,

25:22.281 --> 25:23.881
lifted her up,
and placed her into the rope,

25:23.950 --> 25:25.182
then flung the chair over

25:25.251 --> 25:26.651
making it look like
it was kicked?

25:26.719 --> 25:28.519
And i took a close look
at that chair?

25:28.555 --> 25:30.021
There was
a loose screw on the leg.

25:30.056 --> 25:31.055
I don't even know

25:31.123 --> 25:31.923
if it could have
supported the weight

25:31.958 --> 25:32.924
of someone standing on it.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.093
So, my airtight,

25:36.162 --> 25:38.328
locked-up-and-done suicide

25:38.364 --> 25:39.764
is now murder?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.298
Not yet.

25:41.367 --> 25:42.733
But can we take
a closer look?

25:45.615 --> 25:47.748
She was pretty much
alone in the world.

25:48.007 --> 25:49.340
Both parents dead,

25:48.875 --> 25:50.541
no brothers and sisters.

25:51.845 --> 25:53.945
Did she own this house?

25:54.014 --> 25:55.312
Who would it go to?

25:55.348 --> 25:57.181
Well, it doesn't appear
she had a will,

25:57.216 --> 25:58.482
and if no heirs come forward,

25:58.518 --> 25:59.951
the assets will go to the state.

25:59.986 --> 26:01.252
What were the assets?

26:01.287 --> 26:02.553
Not much.

26:02.588 --> 26:03.855
The house has a mortgage.

26:03.923 --> 26:05.222
Seven-year-old car.

26:09.562 --> 26:12.396
It's spooky in here now.

26:12.431 --> 26:14.431
Well, i'd like to say
you get used to it,

26:14.500 --> 26:16.768
but... not really.

26:16.803 --> 26:17.902
So...

26:17.937 --> 26:20.538
what's on the agenda
for us today?

26:20.573 --> 26:22.840
Well, i never
really did get to see

26:22.876 --> 26:24.676
the whole house, so...

26:24.744 --> 26:27.511
maybe just
look around, okay?

26:27.547 --> 26:28.913
Mm-hmm.

26:30.917 --> 26:32.449
A home recording studio.

26:32.485 --> 26:34.385
I wonder if she left a message.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.821
Well, i think that text
covers messages.

26:36.856 --> 26:38.255
She said her goodbyes.

26:38.291 --> 26:42.393
Did she have a diary,
or anything like that?

26:42.461 --> 26:43.327
Nope.

26:44.731 --> 26:46.864
What about a boyfriend
or an ex?

26:46.900 --> 26:47.865
Her last relationship ended

26:47.901 --> 26:49.600
about two and a half
years ago.

26:49.635 --> 26:51.235
He's married now,
lives in florida.

26:58.812 --> 27:01.012
Hey, there are
two toothbrushes in here.

27:01.047 --> 27:02.046
Two toothbrushes?

27:02.082 --> 27:03.514
Really?

27:03.583 --> 27:05.817
She was murdered.

27:05.885 --> 27:07.085
My wife has
two toothbrushes.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.652
So what?

27:08.688 --> 27:09.754
Can we wrap this up?

27:09.789 --> 27:12.423
I've got a real murder
to follow up on.

27:18.464 --> 27:19.697
Frank...

27:20.900 --> 27:22.233
see?

27:22.301 --> 27:23.968
Take a look at this,
what do you think?

27:25.739 --> 27:27.504
Well, it's
a little wobbly,

27:27.540 --> 27:29.440
doesn't mean somebody
couldn't stand on it.

27:29.475 --> 27:32.610
Yeah, you're probably right.

27:32.645 --> 27:34.578
I don't know, i just...

27:34.647 --> 27:37.181
something doesn't feel right.

27:42.822 --> 27:44.889
Hey, did you see this?

27:44.924 --> 27:46.657
There's a scratch on the floor

27:46.692 --> 27:47.792
where the chair would have been,

27:47.827 --> 27:50.294
but the legs on the chair
have felt pads.

27:50.329 --> 27:52.830
Then that chair
didn't make that scratch.

27:52.866 --> 27:54.732
Do you know what did?

27:54.801 --> 27:55.967
Or how long ago?

27:57.670 --> 27:58.770
Okay, time to go.

27:58.805 --> 28:00.371
[Sighs]

28:00.406 --> 28:01.338
frank...

28:06.545 --> 28:08.045
thank you.

28:08.081 --> 28:09.213
[Squeals in excitement]

28:09.282 --> 28:11.382
you went shopping.

28:11.417 --> 28:14.252
Happy belated birthday
to my baby sister.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.286
Oh.

28:15.321 --> 28:17.721
Here we go.

28:17.757 --> 28:18.756
Look.

28:18.792 --> 28:19.657
So pretty.

28:19.692 --> 28:22.126
Oh. Wow...

28:22.162 --> 28:24.695
i love this one.

28:24.730 --> 28:26.030
Um...

28:27.300 --> 28:29.366
oh, honey, i...

28:29.435 --> 28:31.435
i don't know what to say.

28:31.470 --> 28:32.770
"Thank you." [Laughs]

28:32.839 --> 28:34.205
except i just,

28:34.240 --> 28:35.940
i wouldn't wear any of these.

28:35.975 --> 28:39.277
Dani, i wanted
to get you something nice.

28:39.345 --> 28:40.477
And they are nice.

28:40.513 --> 28:42.579
And they would look
lovely on you.

28:42.615 --> 28:44.916
Listen, dani, i am...

28:44.951 --> 28:46.918
i'm trying to help you.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.652
Sweetheart, you're still single,

28:48.688 --> 28:51.155
and you dress artsy.

28:51.191 --> 28:53.224
Maybe, just maybe,
it's time to...

28:53.259 --> 28:54.992
i don't know,

Do something more important
with your life.

28:57.964 --> 29:00.198
I went to the bathroom
when i needed soap,

29:00.233 --> 29:01.933
i went under your sink,

29:01.968 --> 29:04.568
and i found crystals
attached to your pipes.

29:04.603 --> 29:06.804
[Laughs] dani...

29:06.840 --> 29:08.940
come on, i mean,
that new-age stuff,

29:08.975 --> 29:11.209
it should have been over
years ago.

29:11.244 --> 29:12.710
They cleanse the energy.

29:13.880 --> 29:14.678
You don't have
to believe it.

29:14.714 --> 29:16.914
Well, i don't.

29:16.950 --> 29:18.049
It's okay, it's fine,

29:18.084 --> 29:20.451
you know, i'm just
gonna return these.

29:20.486 --> 29:21.385
Beth ann, i'm sorry--

29:21.454 --> 29:23.587
not a big deal.

29:23.622 --> 29:24.956
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.458
Really, it's totally fine.

29:27.493 --> 29:28.792
It's okay.

29:41.007 --> 29:41.873
Hey.

29:41.908 --> 29:43.207
Do you have access?

29:43.243 --> 29:44.775
I'd like to get inside
and take some photos.

29:44.844 --> 29:46.377
Well, you're gonna have
to contact the owners.

29:46.412 --> 29:47.778
Sorry.

29:47.813 --> 29:48.612
You know they want
to tear this down

29:48.647 --> 29:49.580
and make condos?

29:49.615 --> 29:51.215
Yeah, i heard.

29:51.251 --> 29:53.450
It's been deteriorating
for quite some time now.

29:53.486 --> 29:54.585
Well, it doesn't
look it.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.053
You know,
a bunch of us at school

29:56.089 --> 29:57.855
are trying to get it designated
as a historical building.

29:57.891 --> 29:59.857
They can't just
tear it down.

29:59.893 --> 30:01.792
Things aren't always
the way they look.

30:01.827 --> 30:03.094
These old buildings
are important.

30:03.129 --> 30:04.695
We're losing
all sense of our past.

30:04.730 --> 30:06.330
I agree with you there,

30:06.366 --> 30:08.465
but there might be better
buildings for you to save.

30:08.501 --> 30:10.567
Well, we're starting
with this one.

30:10.603 --> 30:12.970
Then we'll tackle the others.

30:21.447 --> 30:22.780
Dr. Tramell.

30:22.815 --> 30:23.781
Oh, jennifer,

30:23.849 --> 30:25.416
this is a surprise,

30:25.484 --> 30:27.385
i haven't had
any murders lately.

30:27.453 --> 30:28.619
I was at the sound check

30:28.654 --> 30:30.554
when lita merrill
committed suicide.

30:30.589 --> 30:32.423
I have a couple of questions,

30:32.491 --> 30:33.524
off the record.

30:33.559 --> 30:35.559
I won't tell a soul.

30:38.264 --> 30:40.331
I'm just speculating,

30:40.366 --> 30:43.901
have you ever had a murder
staged to appear as a suicide?

30:43.937 --> 30:45.202
Why in the world

30:45.238 --> 30:46.804
would you even begin
to think that in this case?

30:46.839 --> 30:48.105
Just a hunch.

30:51.177 --> 30:53.010
Follow me.

30:59.052 --> 31:00.151
Lita merrill,

31:00.186 --> 31:01.285
a 30-year-old female,

31:01.321 --> 31:03.187
normal weight,
apparently healthy,

31:03.222 --> 31:05.356
no other signs of trauma

31:05.391 --> 31:07.825
other than that
associated with hanging.

31:08.995 --> 31:11.395
What if she was
strangled first?

31:11.431 --> 31:12.896
Well, the bruise
on her neck

31:12.966 --> 31:15.299
would be different.

31:15.335 --> 31:16.934
Here, we have an inverted "v",

31:16.970 --> 31:18.802
which doesn't happen
with a strangulation.

31:18.838 --> 31:21.439
That would be a straight line.

31:21.474 --> 31:23.140
Okay.

31:23.209 --> 31:25.576
What if she were drugged first?

31:25.644 --> 31:26.844
Well, there would be
evidence of that

31:26.879 --> 31:28.179
in her blood stream,

31:28.247 --> 31:30.848
and there's not.

31:41.227 --> 31:42.093
Hey.

31:42.128 --> 31:43.660
Hi, hon.

31:43.696 --> 31:45.463
You're looking
at old buildings?

31:45.498 --> 31:47.999
The hatcher building,
to be precise.

31:48.067 --> 31:49.100
I was out there today,

31:49.135 --> 31:50.201
and i ran into that student

31:50.236 --> 31:52.436
who was giving the speech
at city council.

31:52.472 --> 31:53.770
The one
hannah was at?

31:53.806 --> 31:55.106
Yeah.

31:55.141 --> 31:57.808
She knows i wouldn't
tear down an important building.

31:57.843 --> 31:59.543
But i can't
seem to find

31:59.612 --> 32:02.146
anything important
about it.

32:02.215 --> 32:03.914
What does hannah say?

32:03.983 --> 32:05.383
We haven't had
that conversation.

32:06.585 --> 32:08.819
But i did talk
with frank lynwood today.

32:08.888 --> 32:10.687
He said you dragged him
out to that house

32:10.723 --> 32:12.490
where the musician died.

32:12.525 --> 32:14.392
And he's hoping you'll talk
some sense into me?

32:15.728 --> 32:17.261
Let me ask you this,

32:17.330 --> 32:19.330
is it possible
that this is just a case

32:19.365 --> 32:21.632
of a distraught woman
who took her own life?

32:21.700 --> 32:23.167
Yes.

32:23.202 --> 32:24.235
And frank said

32:24.303 --> 32:25.469
that she had sent a text
from her phone

32:25.505 --> 32:27.438
within an hour
of them discovering her?

32:27.473 --> 32:29.340
That's true, too.

32:29.375 --> 32:31.208
And there are no suspects,
and no motive.

32:31.244 --> 32:33.310
But you think...

32:33.346 --> 32:35.846
i don't know what i think.

32:35.881 --> 32:37.581
I just go by my feelings,

32:37.650 --> 32:39.650
and something
doesn't feel right.

32:41.754 --> 32:42.719
Hey...

32:42.755 --> 32:44.721
you know what i was
thinking about

32:44.790 --> 32:46.190
on the drive home?

32:46.259 --> 32:47.891
Oh, i could guess.

32:47.927 --> 32:49.260
That omelette
you make?

32:49.295 --> 32:50.894
The one with
the swiss cheese

32:50.963 --> 32:51.895
and the provolone.

32:51.964 --> 32:53.764
Oh, it's so good.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.833
I guessed wrong.

she's going to stay.

33:05.945 --> 33:07.545
We kind of got into it.

33:07.580 --> 33:09.346
She bought me
some new clothes,

33:09.382 --> 33:11.182
thinks i should look
less "artsy,"

33:11.217 --> 33:12.416
as she puts it.

33:12.452 --> 33:14.751
Which you take as--

33:14.787 --> 33:16.120
her being critical.

33:16.155 --> 33:18.222
Ah.

33:18.291 --> 33:20.091
Maybe i'm
over-reacting?

33:20.126 --> 33:21.225
Maybe.

33:23.329 --> 33:24.861
At least i spoke the truth.

and seeing her like that.

34:29.462 --> 34:30.761
Did she seem depressed at all?

34:30.795 --> 34:33.197
I think she was having
relationship problems.

34:33.232 --> 34:34.764

who she was involved with?

34:36.668 --> 34:38.702
Not really, no.

34:38.737 --> 34:40.904
Um, all i know is that

34:40.940 --> 34:42.672
one day, lita was really happy,

34:42.708 --> 34:44.175
and then all of a sudden,
she wasn't.

34:44.243 --> 34:45.641
You know, she was
really excited to go on tour,

34:45.710 --> 34:46.777

34:46.846 --> 34:49.146
a dark cloud
just moved in.

34:49.181 --> 34:50.813
Anybody in the band

34:50.850 --> 34:51.949
that knew her well?

34:51.985 --> 34:53.284
No.

34:53.353 --> 34:55.052
She was kind of a loner.

34:55.088 --> 34:56.786
She kept to herself,
kept her secrets.

34:56.822 --> 34:58.789
I was probably
the closest to her.

Yeah, but i don't think
that she had any contact.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.940

to treat this like a murder.

36:17.636 --> 36:19.270
Well, you want a suspect.

36:19.338 --> 36:20.737
You want motive.

36:20.806 --> 36:23.574
The husband is always
the prime suspect, right?

36:23.609 --> 36:25.543

that lita was still married,

changed, has it?

58:16.494 --> 58:17.460
so how can that be murder?

58:17.529 --> 58:18.562
The timing works

58:18.597 --> 58:20.830
if the killer forced her
to send the text.

58:20.866 --> 58:21.965
Then, he leaves,

58:22.000 --> 58:23.399
locks the door with her key.

58:23.435 --> 58:24.467
You and john show up,

58:24.502 --> 58:26.502
and it looks
like a suicide.

58:26.538 --> 58:28.404
Do you have anything
to support this?

58:28.440 --> 58:30.406
There was evidence
at the scene

58:30.442 --> 58:32.141
that a taser
might have been used.

58:34.112 --> 58:37.346
Either you're crazy,
or you're making things up.

58:37.382 --> 58:39.348
You know, lita merrill,
she was a real person,

58:39.384 --> 58:41.184
and it's been hard enough
dealing with her death

58:41.252 --> 58:42.752
without having to relive it
over and over again

58:42.788 --> 58:44.754
because you like mystery books,

58:44.790 --> 58:46.155
so please leave.

58:46.191 --> 58:47.857
I'm sorry, i didn't mean
to upset you.

58:47.926 --> 58:49.425
I was already upset.

58:49.461 --> 58:52.328
Now, if you'll excuse me,
i have work to do.

58:59.705 --> 59:02.472
No, i haven't decided.

59:02.507 --> 59:04.240
It's kind of scary.

59:04.275 --> 59:07.343
Yeah, i've spent
my whole life in school.

59:07.378 --> 59:10.046
One more year, and graduation.

59:10.082 --> 59:12.482
Welcome to the real world.

59:12.517 --> 59:13.516
Grad school's sounding
better and better.

59:13.551 --> 59:15.184
What about you?

59:15.220 --> 59:17.053
I don't know.

59:17.089 --> 59:18.321
I want to travel.

59:18.356 --> 59:19.188
Paris?

59:19.224 --> 59:21.124
- Oh, absolutely.
- Me, too.

59:21.159 --> 59:23.392
I spent three years
taking french,

59:23.428 --> 59:25.194
so i figured
i might as well use it.

59:25.230 --> 59:26.395
That's so funny.

59:26.464 --> 59:27.530
I've been watching
this documentary

59:27.599 --> 59:29.232
on what's underneath paris,

59:29.267 --> 59:31.868
old roman aquaducts,
catacombs.

59:31.903 --> 59:33.003
It's really cool.

59:33.038 --> 59:34.403
I want to see it.

59:34.439 --> 59:36.740
Hmm?
Allons chez moi.

59:36.775 --> 59:38.241
Beth...

59:38.309 --> 59:41.177
parents are always more strict
with the first child, right?

59:41.246 --> 59:43.513
Come on,
it went way beyond that.

59:43.548 --> 59:46.549
Dani, i had to be responsible,

59:46.618 --> 59:48.151
get straight "a"s,

59:48.219 --> 59:49.218
only date boys

59:49.254 --> 59:51.387
that they approved of.

59:51.422 --> 59:52.656
Do you remember

59:52.691 --> 59:53.990
dad used to always
call me his "pride."

59:54.026 --> 59:55.125
Yes.

59:55.160 --> 59:58.628
But you
were his "joy."

59:58.664 --> 01:00:00.930
I wanted to be his joy, too.

01:00:00.966 --> 01:00:04.734
Oh, man, i was so jealous
of the way he would light up

01:00:04.803 --> 01:00:07.737
whenever you were around.

01:00:07.773 --> 01:00:08.972
And of your talent.

01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:10.840
You're talented.

01:00:10.876 --> 01:00:12.375
Not like you.

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:13.509
You're the artist.

01:00:13.578 --> 01:00:14.678
I'm just...

01:00:14.746 --> 01:00:16.179
i want to show you something.

01:00:26.424 --> 01:00:28.424
Oh, wow, that's our house,

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:29.693
where we grew up...

01:00:29.728 --> 01:00:30.894
mm-hmm.

01:00:30.929 --> 01:00:32.595
You painted that.

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:34.230
What?

01:00:36.601 --> 01:00:38.134
Oh, my goodness, i did.

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:39.169
Didn't i?

01:00:39.204 --> 01:00:40.336
Mm-hmm.

01:00:40.405 --> 01:00:42.072
You've kept this?

01:00:42.107 --> 01:00:44.708
Of course, i kept it,
it's beautiful.

01:00:44.743 --> 01:00:46.509
Beth, you're really good.

01:00:51.216 --> 01:00:53.416
[Sighs heavily]

01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:55.719
honey, i overheard
your phone call today.

01:00:56.988 --> 01:00:58.621
What do you mean?

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:02.258
Well, i was outside the door
when you were talking to peter.

01:01:03.361 --> 01:01:06.162
My marriage is over.

01:01:06.198 --> 01:01:08.064
Beth, i am so sorry.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.065
It's okay.

01:01:10.635 --> 01:01:12.501
And i feel okay.

01:01:14.873 --> 01:01:17.040
And i hope we're okay.

01:01:17.075 --> 01:01:18.174
Are we okay?

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:19.609
We're good, right?

01:01:19.644 --> 01:01:21.644
Oh, yeah.

01:01:21.713 --> 01:01:24.013
Yeah, we're getting there.

01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:26.582
I don't know,
i feel stronger.

01:01:26.618 --> 01:01:29.219
I feel like i'm ready
to go back

01:01:29.254 --> 01:01:32.421
and deal with the things
that i need to deal with.

01:01:32.457 --> 01:01:33.923
And you know
what i think helped?

01:01:33.959 --> 01:01:34.791
What?

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.159
The crystals.

01:01:36.194 --> 01:01:37.360
Yeah.

01:01:37.395 --> 01:01:38.628
For real.

01:01:38.663 --> 01:01:40.830
I mean, i really actually
think that they work.

01:01:40.899 --> 01:01:43.332
[Whispering] i have more.

01:01:43.368 --> 01:01:45.201
It's spooky down there.

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:47.170
All those bones?
Wow...

01:01:47.239 --> 01:01:48.704
i'd still go.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.007
I love that part
of notre dame.

01:01:53.444 --> 01:01:54.310
Hannah...

01:01:57.015 --> 01:01:58.948
can i talk to you
for a minute?

01:01:58.984 --> 01:02:00.483
Aj, this is
my dad, jason,

01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:01.918
and dad,
this is aj.

01:02:01.953 --> 01:02:02.819
We've already met.

01:02:02.854 --> 01:02:03.753
Hello, aj.

01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:05.855
Hi.

01:02:05.924 --> 01:02:07.490
You're hannah's dad?

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:08.925
Yup.

01:02:08.994 --> 01:02:10.860
Where did you meet?

01:02:10.896 --> 01:02:13.163
Hannah?

01:02:20.272 --> 01:02:23.072
Oh, it can't be
that bad.

01:02:23.141 --> 01:02:24.373
My daughter's
going out with a guy

01:02:24.442 --> 01:02:26.342
who thinks i'm trying
to destroy our town's history.

01:02:26.411 --> 01:02:27.576
They're just friends.

01:02:27.612 --> 01:02:28.711
Jenn...

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:31.047
no one's just friends
at that age.

01:02:31.116 --> 01:02:32.648
Is there a way

01:02:32.684 --> 01:02:35.118
for you two to find
a common ground?

01:02:35.187 --> 01:02:36.719
I'm working on it.

01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:41.991
So, i was
at the morgue today...

01:02:47.032 --> 01:02:48.364
when do you
want to edit?

01:02:48.399 --> 01:02:49.432
Are you sure?

01:02:49.467 --> 01:02:50.466
Your dad's not
going to be happy...

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:51.667
oh, let me worry
about my dad.

01:02:51.703 --> 01:02:53.169
He's cool, really.

01:02:53.205 --> 01:02:55.571
I'll take
your word for it.

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:56.706
[Chuckling]

01:02:56.741 --> 01:02:57.974
how's tuesday sound?

01:02:58.009 --> 01:02:59.309
That works.

01:02:59.344 --> 01:03:01.744
And... i really had fun tonight.

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:03.479
I mean, before.

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:05.348
Me, too.

01:03:06.952 --> 01:03:08.351
See you tuesday.

01:03:08.386 --> 01:03:09.418
See you then.

01:03:14.092 --> 01:03:15.258
Detective lynwood said

01:03:15.327 --> 01:03:16.625
he is now
seriously considering

01:03:16.661 --> 01:03:17.827
this could be a murder.

01:03:17.863 --> 01:03:19.162
How is that possible?

01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:21.764
It's still up in the air,

01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:26.069
but they found evidence that
a taser might have been used.

01:03:26.104 --> 01:03:27.703
I didn't see
a taser.

01:03:27.739 --> 01:03:28.972
No taser
found,

01:03:29.007 --> 01:03:30.773
just evidence
that one might have been used.

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:32.541
[John]: that doesn't
make any sense.

01:03:32.577 --> 01:03:35.211
[Sighs]
this is horrible.

01:03:35.247 --> 01:03:36.846
Was it this bo taylor?

01:03:36.882 --> 01:03:40.250
Detective lynwood is trying
to find out who owned it.

01:03:41.219 --> 01:03:42.852
How?

01:03:42.888 --> 01:03:45.288
They leave behind tags
that can i.d. the owner.

01:03:45.323 --> 01:03:47.823
Really?

01:03:47.859 --> 01:03:49.725
That'll be
interesting.

01:03:49.794 --> 01:03:50.526
That's not "interesting."

01:03:51.796 --> 01:03:53.229
I can't handle this.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.200
I'm sorry.

01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:02.005
We can deal with a musician
dying before the tour.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.274
It's sad, and we'll honor her.

01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:06.209
But a murder?

01:04:06.244 --> 01:04:08.677
That's all the press
is gonna care about.

01:04:32.203 --> 01:04:32.936
[Glass shattering]

01:04:51.656 --> 01:04:53.356
[loud thud]

01:05:00.571 --> 01:05:04.140
<i>[police radio chatter]</i>

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:08.077
jenn, hey.

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:09.112
You can't go in there,

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.312
they're still
collecting evidence.

01:05:10.348 --> 01:05:11.848
I just saw cassie yesterday.

01:05:11.883 --> 01:05:12.949
What happened?

01:05:12.984 --> 01:05:14.083
Looks like
a robbery gone wrong.

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:15.885
Typical smash-and-grab.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.486
How did she die?

01:05:17.521 --> 01:05:18.721
Appears she confronted
the thief.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:19.822
It was late at night,

01:05:19.858 --> 01:05:21.891
obviously, he assumed
she was sleeping.

01:05:21.926 --> 01:05:25.027
There's some definite
evidence of a struggle.

01:05:25.063 --> 01:05:26.996
She took some blows to the head
from a brass lamp.

01:05:28.399 --> 01:05:29.598
You should go
back to the store, jenn.

01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:30.800
I'll talk to you later.

01:05:30.835 --> 01:05:31.934
Okay.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:33.136
I know what you're thinking,

01:05:33.171 --> 01:05:34.904
and i don't know
if this is connected

01:05:34.939 --> 01:05:36.839
to lita merrill's death or not.

01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:39.308
Frank, one more thing,

01:05:39.343 --> 01:05:41.110
any word on the owner
of the taser gun?

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.245
Not yet.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.413
We've contacted
the manufacturer, though.

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:46.482
Oh, and to make things
a little more interesting,

01:05:46.517 --> 01:05:48.217
bo's disappeared.

01:05:48.253 --> 01:05:50.486
I went to the motel
where he's been staying.

01:05:50.521 --> 01:05:52.054
Yeah, the manager said
that he cleared out

01:05:52.123 --> 01:05:53.489
in the middle of the night.

01:05:57.561 --> 01:05:59.328
It's too much of a coincidence.

01:05:59.363 --> 01:06:01.931
Lynwood says it was a robbery,
but i don't think so.

01:06:01.966 --> 01:06:03.065
If these deaths are connected,

01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:04.566
what did cassie know
that got her killed?

01:06:04.635 --> 01:06:05.868
I don't know,

01:06:05.937 --> 01:06:07.603
but when i saw her yesterday,
something was off.

01:06:07.638 --> 01:06:10.006
Bo taylor was your suspect
in lita's death.

01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:12.474
Now, what is there
to connect him to cassie?

01:06:13.812 --> 01:06:16.712
I don't see a connection.

01:06:16.747 --> 01:06:18.047
Maybe it was a robbery.

01:06:19.317 --> 01:06:20.249
Hi, logan.

01:06:20.285 --> 01:06:21.784
Hey, dani.

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:23.252
Hey, um, i was able
to open the flash.

01:06:23.321 --> 01:06:25.521
My friend has
a home studio.

01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:27.389
Great.
What was on it?

01:06:27.425 --> 01:06:29.525
Bunch of songs,
sounded like demos.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.628
Mostly "love is wonderful"
kind of stuff,

01:06:32.663 --> 01:06:35.198
but the most recent one
it's different.

01:06:35.233 --> 01:06:36.532
It's a real downer.

01:06:36.567 --> 01:06:37.934
Well, can i hear it?

01:06:37.969 --> 01:06:39.235
Yeah, the software's
on my computer,

01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:40.970
so you'll have to listen to it
when you get home,

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:44.307
but here,
i wrote you down the lyrics.

01:06:44.342 --> 01:06:46.075
Anyways, i've got
to book it, so...

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:47.143
see ya.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:48.610
Thanks, honey,
i'll see you tonight.

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.547
What's it say?

01:06:51.615 --> 01:06:53.549
Seems to be about a...

loves the idea,

so we're applying
for a historical designation.

are in real time.

here's a map of our town,

and these little symbols,
those are cell towers.

01:12:02.793 --> 01:12:04.226
When you make a cell phone call,

01:12:04.262 --> 01:12:05.427
your phone connects
to the nearest tower,

01:12:05.496 --> 01:12:06.862
and it's sent
from one to another

01:12:06.897 --> 01:12:08.997
until it reaches
its destination.

01:12:09.066 --> 01:12:11.066

and she dies.

01:12:17.775 --> 01:12:19.508
I then take
her cell phone,

and i bring to a bar
where i'm meeting some friends.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:22.511
I go into the restroom,

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:25.648
and i send a text
from dani's phone to my phone

to drive me over there.

would ever guess

if cass was here,

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:54.128
she'd kick your butt

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:55.996
for even
suggesting we quit.

01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:57.797
She was

the policy would pay off.

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.752
