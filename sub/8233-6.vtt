WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Previously
on Witches of East End...

00:03.033 --> 00:04.233
We should consult your family.

00:04.266 --> 00:07.000
(screaming, yelling)

00:07.033 --> 00:08.700
JOANNA: Well, now we know for
sure what's been killing people

00:08.733 --> 00:10.833
in the town; it's a Mandragora.

00:10.866 --> 00:12.633
But why would it even come here
from Asgard?

00:12.666 --> 00:14.300
They're feral creatures.

00:14.333 --> 00:16.500
Grandfather built an entire
army to do his bidding.

00:16.533 --> 00:18.800
He must have sent this one
through the portal after me.

00:18.833 --> 00:21.533
JOANNA: What is that?
ALEX: This dart contains
a poison called discidium.

00:21.566 --> 00:23.733
Enough to kill even
a Mandragora.

00:23.766 --> 00:25.066
This is all pretty crazy.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.366
We're warlocks.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.966
Guess who else is one of us?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.166
Beauchamps.

00:30.366 --> 00:31.566
I need to talk to you.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.400
My father died.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.500
(sniffles)

00:36.033 --> 00:37.066
JOANNA:
Don't go with him!

00:37.100 --> 00:38.766
No. No!

00:43.266 --> 00:45.966
Yes, I'll meet you in an hour?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.966
Yeah.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.866
I just needed to get
a few things done here

00:50.900 --> 00:53.666
while we are closed.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.033
(sighs)

00:59.066 --> 01:00.900
(clattering in distance)

01:02.066 --> 01:04.066
Hello?

01:08.500 --> 01:10.500
Is anyone there?

01:13.566 --> 01:15.233
Ingrid? Ingrid, are you okay?

01:15.266 --> 01:19.000
I'm so glad
it's gonna be you, Hudson.

01:19.033 --> 01:20.300
What?

01:20.333 --> 01:22.700
You've been chosen.

01:24.066 --> 01:26.433
(deep growling)

01:29.333 --> 01:31.500
(screaming)

01:36.533 --> 01:38.500
(bubbling)

01:38.533 --> 01:40.166
JOANNA: Mmm... Can you hand me
the Mandragora's cup?

01:40.200 --> 01:43.366
Yeah.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.900
I didn't realize
that the discidium potion

01:44.933 --> 01:45.966
would be so involved.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.400
Or smell like dog vomit.

01:47.433 --> 01:48.700
(chuckles)
It's very powerful.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.800
It does have to kill
a Mandragora.

01:50.833 --> 01:54.000
So why do we have to cook
this goo, anyway?

01:54.033 --> 01:55.966
I thought Alex had enough
to do the job.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.900
No, there was only
enough to coat two darts,

01:57.933 --> 01:59.133
and we used one.

01:59.166 --> 02:00.533
Plus, we need some for Ingrid.

02:00.566 --> 02:02.000
Wait... what?

02:02.033 --> 02:03.300
You're gonna use this on Ingrid?

02:03.333 --> 02:05.033
We don't have a choice.
Joanna, honey,

02:05.066 --> 02:07.200
okay, I don't think you're
thinking this through.

02:07.233 --> 02:10.900
The Mandragora has Ingrid
in a really creepy trance

02:10.933 --> 02:12.966
that we can't break on our own,

02:13.000 --> 02:14.666
so this should bring her
out of it.

02:14.700 --> 02:17.366
We just have to use a smaller
dose on her than on him.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.733
Okay, but it's a poison,
so what if...

02:19.766 --> 02:22.033
I don't want to have to think
about the what‐ifs.

02:22.066 --> 02:23.500
Pulling Ingrid
out of the mind spell

02:23.533 --> 02:24.666
is just the first step.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.133
We still need to figure out how

02:26.166 --> 02:27.700
to sever
the symbiotic connection

02:27.733 --> 02:29.066
between Ingrid
and the Mandragora,

02:29.100 --> 02:31.400
so we can kill it
without killing her.

02:31.433 --> 02:33.700
And you do know how
to do that, right?

02:34.900 --> 02:36.500
Right?

02:36.533 --> 02:38.400
First things first.

02:41.566 --> 02:43.966
Freya...

02:44.000 --> 02:45.966
this is crazy.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.866
We're in the middle of a crisis,
and you're still avoiding me.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.566
You haven't spoken
to me since I...

02:49.600 --> 02:52.966
Your friends killed our father?
They weren't my friends,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.300
and I've beaten myself up
every day since.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.900
You look fine; must not be
punching hard enough.

02:57.933 --> 02:59.700
You can't blame me
for what the Zurka twins did.

02:59.733 --> 03:00.900
They're bottom‐feeding rats.

03:00.933 --> 03:02.800
I heard the stories, Frederick.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.533
You were practically
their ringleader.

03:04.566 --> 03:06.966
I know exactly
what type of person you are.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.200
Yeah, I'm your twin.

03:08.233 --> 03:09.500
And you are nothing like me.

03:09.533 --> 03:10.700
And that's good.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.300
Aunt Wendy was right about you.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.633
This is completely ridiculous.

03:13.666 --> 03:15.533
I hated the Zurkas.
I got rid of them.

03:15.566 --> 03:17.000
I've done nothing
since I've been here

03:17.033 --> 03:18.900
but try to help
and protect this family.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.200
And since you've been here,
everything's gotten worse.

03:28.066 --> 03:29.300
Can I get a beer?

03:29.333 --> 03:30.833
Yeah, sure thing.

03:30.866 --> 03:33.066
CUSTOMER:
Gee, thanks, shitty bartender.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.800
I only had to wait
a million years.

03:34.833 --> 03:37.533
What'd you say to me?

03:37.566 --> 03:40.166
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.

03:42.666 --> 03:44.533
NERVOUS WOMAN:
If he's gonna have an affair,

03:44.566 --> 03:46.533
then I'm gonna have an affair.

03:46.566 --> 03:48.166
Oh.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.033
He's cute.

03:51.066 --> 03:53.200
I wonder if he wants
to have sex with me.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.000
Thanks, man.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.066
Why don't you just put
some more head on this?

04:04.100 --> 04:06.800
Worst pour ever.

04:06.833 --> 04:09.066
BUSINESSMAN: I just want to kill
my boss; he's such a dick.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.833
MAN: All she has to do
is lose 50 to 100 pounds.

04:11.866 --> 04:14.333
What's the difference between
manslaughter and murder?

04:14.366 --> 04:17.200
(overlapping voices)

04:28.733 --> 04:30.766
(overlapping voices continue)

04:32.566 --> 04:35.400
Oh, smells like
that discidium's ready.

04:35.433 --> 04:37.166
Yeah, as soon as it's cooled.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.500
How are we supposed to get
Ingrid to take this, anyway?

04:39.533 --> 04:41.466
She can barely gag
down cough medicine.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.800
ALEX: For this to work,
it needs

04:42.833 --> 04:44.033
to be injected directly
into the brain.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.866
What?
FREYA:
Through her skull?

04:45.900 --> 04:47.833
That brain? How the hell
are we gonna do that?

04:47.866 --> 04:49.966
By any means necessary.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.500
FREDERICK:
Even if you find Ingrid,

04:51.533 --> 04:53.133
what do you do
if that thing attacks?

04:53.166 --> 04:55.033
We can't kill it
without killing her.

04:55.066 --> 04:56.533
Well, if it attacks,
we'll have to inflict it

04:56.566 --> 04:58.200
with a nonlethal wound,
preferably in its leg

04:58.233 --> 05:01.633
so it can't chase us,
because if it can, we're dead.

05:01.666 --> 05:03.566
But if you wound the Mandragora,
then you'll wound Ingrid.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.466
Which is why we need to unlink
them as quickly as we can.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.666
But you don't know
how to do that,

05:06.700 --> 05:07.966
and there's no spell for that

05:08.000 --> 05:09.300
in our Grimoire.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.500
There might be one more
at Fair Haven.

05:11.533 --> 05:13.466
In Archibald Browning's
Grimoire.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.366
He fancied himself a bit
of an expert on the beasts.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.800
Okay, yeah, but he's been dead
for over 100 years.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.633
We don't even know what happened
to his Grimoire.

05:20.666 --> 05:22.066
I know what happened to it.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.700
Ingrid told me Dash
and Killian found it.

05:24.733 --> 05:27.300
It's at Fair Haven.
I should go.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.166
I need to talk to Dash, see if
he'll help us with the spell.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.533
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you
think that's a good idea?

05:30.566 --> 05:31.733
Last time you saw him,

05:31.766 --> 05:33.466
he didn't look too helpful.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.333
I told you, Ingrid has been
helping him with his powers.

05:35.366 --> 05:37.000
We're all the same now;
that changes everything.

05:37.033 --> 05:38.833
And you think just because
the two of you are magic,

05:38.866 --> 05:40.666
that he's just gonna forget
that you left him at the altar?

05:40.700 --> 05:42.566
This isn't about me.
It's about Ingrid.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.900
He's gonna want to help her.

05:43.933 --> 05:45.400
Okay, fine.
I'm coming with you.

05:45.433 --> 05:47.333
I don't think so.
I should talk to him alone.

05:47.366 --> 05:48.800
JOANNA:
Wendy, let her go.

05:48.833 --> 05:51.000
She can handle it.
Here, you're gonna be safe.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.500
You're gonna take these
just in case

05:52.533 --> 05:53.900
you run into Ingrid
in a trance.

05:53.933 --> 05:55.233
And I'm gonna stab her
in the brain?

05:55.266 --> 05:56.466
ALEX:
And then you and Ingrid

05:56.500 --> 05:57.533
need to run like hell.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.533
All right, so while Freya's

05:59.566 --> 06:01.233
at Fair Haven,
we're gonna look for Ingrid.

06:01.266 --> 06:03.166
They'll be in hiding,
since it's still daylight.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.300
All right, so we need to check
in the woods, at her apartment,

06:06.333 --> 06:08.666
and at the library.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.866
(gasps)
Look.

06:25.866 --> 06:28.300
Hudson.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.466
Who's this poor bastard?

06:30.500 --> 06:32.533
He's Ingrid's friend.
I didn't work.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.366
I wasn't worthy.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.833
(gasps)

06:35.866 --> 06:37.366
Look familiar?
Yeah, it looks like

06:37.400 --> 06:39.200
we were both marked
against our will.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.066
Except that your mark
involved an oath.
Seriously?

06:41.100 --> 06:43.833
You want me to take an oath
of loyalty to you right now?

06:43.866 --> 06:45.066
Would that be enough?
Please, will you both stop it?

06:45.100 --> 06:47.500
Hudson, look at me.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.066
Hudson, look at me.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.633
Hello, Joanna.

06:50.666 --> 06:51.900
I was chosen.

06:53.733 --> 06:56.033
He wanted to wear my skin,

06:56.066 --> 06:58.500
but it wasn't a good fit.

06:58.533 --> 07:00.700
(laughing)

07:03.000 --> 07:06.533
Okay, so he recognizes
his own name.

07:06.566 --> 07:07.966
That's a good sign, right?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.533
He's not like the others.
But this means

07:09.566 --> 07:11.166
that Ingrid
and the Mandragora were here.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.000
They might still be.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.833
Then let's find them.
No.

07:14.866 --> 07:16.700
Wendy, I need you and
Frederick to take Hudson

07:16.733 --> 07:19.133
back to the house.
All right.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.866
Just do whatever you can
to save him.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.533
Come on.
Come on.

07:22.566 --> 07:24.966
Okay, Hudson,
we're going for a little ride.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.966
(weak laugh)
On a magic carpet?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.033
Close.
It's a station wagon.

07:29.066 --> 07:31.866
(laughs)

07:37.366 --> 07:39.366
(coughs)

07:44.366 --> 07:46.433
(knocking on door)

07:54.400 --> 07:56.300
Dash, hi.

07:56.333 --> 07:58.366
What are you doing here?

07:58.400 --> 08:01.233
I'm sorry to bother you,
but Ingrid's in trouble.

08:01.266 --> 08:03.366
We need your help.

08:05.733 --> 08:08.633
Come on in.

08:08.666 --> 08:10.733
Thanks.

08:10.766 --> 08:12.966
I'm always happy to help.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.200
Okay.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.166
ALEX:
I think he's on to us.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.366
So he'll be keeping her close.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.166
Because by nightfall,

08:26.200 --> 08:27.966
he'll be feeding off of Ingrid.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.833
I'd rather not think about
what that process entails.

08:29.866 --> 08:31.133
Let's just hope we find her

08:31.166 --> 08:33.000
before the second feeding.

08:33.033 --> 08:35.533
After that, the trick
is gonna be severing

08:35.566 --> 08:36.733
their connection.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.133
Oh, my God!

08:38.166 --> 08:40.066
Ingrid!

08:40.100 --> 08:42.200
Wait, wait, wait, don't,
don't, don't wake her up.

08:42.233 --> 08:43.700
Why?
We need to get the discidium

08:43.733 --> 08:46.700
into her brain
before he gets back.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I don't think I can do this.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.833
You have to.
No, it could kill her.

08:54.866 --> 08:56.066
Oh, fine, I'll do it.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.333
No, you are not

08:57.366 --> 08:58.533
stabbing my baby.

08:58.566 --> 08:59.833
Well, one of us
is stabbing her.

08:59.866 --> 09:00.900
Because if she wakes up
before we do,

09:00.933 --> 09:02.200
she will attack us.

09:02.233 --> 09:04.700
She's still entranced.

09:04.733 --> 09:06.166
Look at her breathing.
You're here to hurt him!

09:06.200 --> 09:07.700
I won't let you!
Joanna.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.833
Ingrid, baby.

09:12.866 --> 09:13.966
Sana.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.400
Sana, sana, Ingrid.

09:16.433 --> 09:18.700
Sana.

09:18.733 --> 09:20.966
(gasping)

09:21.000 --> 09:22.533
Mom?

09:22.566 --> 09:24.533
Mom?
Oh, God.

09:24.566 --> 09:27.033
Where am I?

09:27.066 --> 09:29.066
What‐What's happening?

09:29.100 --> 09:30.533
Oh, come on.

09:30.566 --> 09:33.500

09:41.166 --> 09:42.500

09:44.600 --> 09:47.766

(growling)

09:58.789 --> 10:00.389
Did you get him?
No.

10:00.422 --> 10:03.556
He's just looking
for a better line of attack.

10:09.756 --> 10:11.289
What are you doing to him?

10:11.322 --> 10:12.722
I'm easing his pain.

10:12.756 --> 10:15.022
I've already tried
a dozen healing spells.

10:15.056 --> 10:17.956
Nothing's worked.
But this spell can dissipate
Drago Sanguinem.

10:17.989 --> 10:20.222
Dragon's blood? What's that?
It's the Mandragora's venom.

10:20.256 --> 10:23.022
It's what's gonna kill him
if we don't stop it.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.856
How would you know that?

10:24.889 --> 10:26.389
Losa sársauka l kna...
Stop.

10:26.422 --> 10:28.389
Just yesterday,

10:28.422 --> 10:30.389
you said the only thing you knew
about Mandragoras

10:30.422 --> 10:32.356
is that the king uses them
to hunt his enemies.

10:32.389 --> 10:33.689
Now, all of a sudden,
you know the name of the venom

10:33.722 --> 10:35.389
and how to counteract it?

10:35.422 --> 10:37.956
Please, get out of the way.
I'm trying to save his life.

10:37.989 --> 10:39.622
Or you're trying to kill him
before he says something

10:39.656 --> 10:41.389
that you don't want us to hear.

10:41.422 --> 10:43.556
This is absurd! What have I done
since I've been here?

10:43.589 --> 10:46.256
Saved my mother's life,
got rid of the Zurka twins,

10:46.289 --> 10:49.656
tried everything in my power
to keep this family safe!

10:51.789 --> 10:53.256
What do I need to do
to prove to you...?

10:53.289 --> 10:54.356
I want you gone.

10:54.389 --> 10:56.389
Leave him alone.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.922
Hola, mi amor.

11:24.956 --> 11:27.389
Hola.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.522
I thought you were at work.

11:31.556 --> 11:33.522
Left.

11:33.556 --> 11:34.689
Came home sick.

11:34.722 --> 11:36.122
Oh, no. Are you okay?

11:36.156 --> 11:37.456
Yeah, fine.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.656
Here, try this.

11:41.456 --> 11:44.056
Oh...?

11:44.089 --> 11:46.856
Rum punch.

11:46.889 --> 11:49.389
It reminds me of the night

11:49.422 --> 11:51.389
we slept on the beach.

11:51.422 --> 11:54.889
I don't remember
getting much sleep that night.

11:54.922 --> 11:58.789
So, you just left
work at the bar

11:58.822 --> 12:01.689
to come home and
make us drinks?

12:01.722 --> 12:04.956
Just needed a break.

12:04.989 --> 12:08.356
From all the voices.

12:08.389 --> 12:12.056
What voices?

12:15.489 --> 12:17.022
Sometimes I feel like

12:17.056 --> 12:18.456
I can hear
what people are thinking.

12:18.489 --> 12:22.422
Like their inner voice
is inside my head.

12:22.456 --> 12:24.589
Lately it's been getting worse.

12:26.156 --> 12:29.589
Mind reading is
one of your gifts.

12:29.622 --> 12:31.389
It worked to your advantage
at the poker table.

12:31.422 --> 12:32.456
It doesn't feel like a gift.

12:32.489 --> 12:33.789
It feels like I'm eavesdropping

12:33.822 --> 12:35.589
on a conversation
I don't want to hear.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.622
And most people's
inner monologues?

12:37.656 --> 12:39.589
Disturbing as shit.

12:39.622 --> 12:42.856
You'll learn to tune it out
as soon as you learn to let go.

12:42.889 --> 12:44.856
Magic?

12:44.889 --> 12:47.689
It's tricky like that.

12:47.722 --> 12:49.922
The less you try
to force control

12:49.956 --> 12:52.056
over your abilities,

12:52.089 --> 12:53.956
the more control you'll have.

12:53.989 --> 12:56.222
I didn't ask
for these abilities.

12:56.256 --> 12:57.622
I was fine without them.

12:57.656 --> 12:59.622
You'll learn to live with them.

12:59.656 --> 13:02.256
Soon it'll just be

13:02.289 --> 13:03.956
another fact about you.

13:03.989 --> 13:06.289
Like being right‐handed.

13:06.322 --> 13:09.389
Or playing the piano.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.722
You know what's strange?

13:11.756 --> 13:14.189
Some people I can read so well,

13:14.222 --> 13:15.722
and others are just...

13:17.956 --> 13:19.956
...blank to me.

13:23.289 --> 13:24.856
(laughs quietly)

13:24.889 --> 13:27.422
I've never been able to read

13:27.456 --> 13:28.789
one of your thoughts.

13:31.622 --> 13:33.189
Maybe that's a good thing.
Oh, yeah?

13:33.222 --> 13:34.856
Why's that?

13:34.889 --> 13:37.822
Because if you knew what I
was thinking right now...

13:40.489 --> 13:43.322

23:11.256 --> 23:13.256
(chokes, gasps)

23:15.089 --> 23:17.256
This isn't you, Dash.

23:17.289 --> 23:19.556
It's the Mandragora venom.

23:19.589 --> 23:21.356
It brings on
psychosis.

23:21.389 --> 23:22.756
I can help you.

23:22.789 --> 23:25.089
See, that's what you don't get.

23:25.122 --> 23:26.956
This is me, Freya.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.889
I've changed.

23:28.922 --> 23:30.356
I've done things

23:30.389 --> 23:32.589
that'll make you shudder.

23:32.622 --> 23:34.889
Freya, you have no idea

23:34.922 --> 23:37.389
what I'm capable of.

23:37.422 --> 23:38.856
But you're about
to find out!

23:38.889 --> 23:40.322
(choking)

23:41.556 --> 23:44.089
(Dash groans)

23:47.889 --> 23:49.122
(gasps)

23:54.389 --> 23:55.622
Alex.

23:58.156 --> 23:59.389
Oh.

23:59.422 --> 24:00.756
Are you okay?

24:00.789 --> 24:02.256
I... what happened?

24:02.289 --> 24:03.522
What did it do to us?

24:03.556 --> 24:04.756
I don't know.

24:04.789 --> 24:06.356
I‐I‐I feel fine.

24:06.389 --> 24:09.022
So do I.

24:09.056 --> 24:10.422
Ingrid.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.356
What?

24:18.389 --> 24:20.822
Whoa.

24:31.989 --> 24:33.889
This doesn't
make sense.

24:33.922 --> 24:36.089
Of course
it does.

24:36.122 --> 24:37.289
We can't get
out of here.

24:37.322 --> 24:38.789
This is what
it did to us.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.534
(grunts, gasps)

24:55.900 --> 24:57.400
DASH:
It's no use, Freya.

24:57.434 --> 24:59.900
I've made sure
that you can't get out.

24:59.934 --> 25:01.400
FREYA:
Dash...

25:01.434 --> 25:04.167
I'm begging you,
please don't do this.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.334
I know there's still
good inside of you.

25:06.367 --> 25:08.367
If that's what
you need to believe...

25:08.400 --> 25:10.500
whisper it to yourself

25:10.534 --> 25:12.100
while I smash your skull in.

25:15.567 --> 25:18.400
Procumbe!

25:18.434 --> 25:19.667
(groans)

25:19.700 --> 25:21.700
(wheezing laugh)

25:21.734 --> 25:24.500
Is... is that all you got?

25:24.534 --> 25:27.067
I bet you banged my brother
harder than that.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.000
No matter what
you think,

25:29.034 --> 25:31.067
I never slept with Killian.

25:31.100 --> 25:33.234
I loved you, Dash.

25:33.267 --> 25:34.700
I really did.
Thank you, Freya.

25:36.367 --> 25:38.000
For what?

25:38.034 --> 25:39.667
For leaving me.

25:39.700 --> 25:42.600
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

25:42.634 --> 25:46.100
Do you have any idea
how many people

25:46.134 --> 25:49.767
told me not to lower myself
to be with you?

25:49.800 --> 25:53.600
A white trash bartender
who barely finished high school?

25:53.634 --> 25:55.234
My mother

25:55.267 --> 25:56.700
would cry herself
to sleep at night,

25:56.734 --> 25:59.234
ashamed that her son
was too stupid to realize

25:59.267 --> 26:02.867
what a gold‐digging little whore
he had for a fiancée.

26:02.900 --> 26:05.867
And she was right about you.

26:05.900 --> 26:08.067
Everyone was right

26:08.100 --> 26:09.467
about you.

26:11.434 --> 26:13.267
Clever girl.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.034
Oh, you have no idea.

26:15.067 --> 26:16.300
(grunts)

26:18.134 --> 26:20.800
Nice little trick, huh?

26:25.400 --> 26:27.234
Oh, God.

26:27.267 --> 26:29.700
Are you all right?
(gasps)

26:29.734 --> 26:32.434
(sighs) Sana, sana.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.034
Sana, sana.

26:34.067 --> 26:36.434
I tried to kill you,
didn't I?

26:36.467 --> 26:37.734
It wasn't you.

26:37.767 --> 26:39.434
It was the venom.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.100
My priority now is Ingrid.

26:41.134 --> 26:42.567
Let me help.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.767
Please.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.100
For Ingrid.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.567
Okay.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.434
JOANNA:
I'm calling Wendy.

26:52.467 --> 26:54.100
She can help get us out of here.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.067
ALEX:
It won't work.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.267
There's no reception.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.600
Wait.

26:58.634 --> 27:00.767
How did you know
that it wouldn't work?

27:00.800 --> 27:02.034
'Cause I know about this.

27:02.067 --> 27:04.600
Nobody can get us
out of here.

27:04.634 --> 27:06.600
This head game?
It's gonna go on and on

27:06.634 --> 27:08.734
till we don't know what's real
and what's not anymore.

27:11.234 --> 27:12.200
Oh!

27:12.234 --> 27:14.267
I feel like I am losing my mind.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.534
Alex, relax.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.434
We need to think.

27:17.467 --> 27:18.767
We can figure
this out.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.434
There's no
"figuring" this out.

27:21.467 --> 27:23.467
We're trapped here.
Damn it!

27:25.067 --> 27:27.034
Okay. Getting angry's
not gonna help.

27:27.067 --> 27:29.700
It wouldn't kill you
to get angry once in a while.

27:29.734 --> 27:31.434
It feels good.

27:31.467 --> 27:34.234
I mean, show some emotion
for once in your life, Joanna.

27:34.267 --> 27:35.934
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

27:35.967 --> 27:38.934
I overheard Wendy saying
something about Victor.

27:38.967 --> 27:41.100
I know he died, but you
haven't mentioned him once.

27:41.134 --> 27:42.700
I am not doing
this right now.

27:42.734 --> 27:44.100
Oh, that's right.

27:44.134 --> 27:45.900
Yeah, walk away when
things get too real,

27:45.934 --> 27:47.567
just like you always do.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.067
Oh, just because
I'm not doing

27:49.100 --> 27:51.034
what you want me
to do, or feeling

27:51.067 --> 27:52.767
what you want
me to feel?
No, no, no.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.567
This is about letting
yourself feel.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.100
You told me that
my intensity scared you?

27:58.134 --> 28:00.234
That's bullshit.

28:00.267 --> 28:02.600
Your intensity
scares you.

28:02.634 --> 28:05.900
You run away from anyone
who makes you feel things.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.100
That's why you ran
away from me,

28:08.134 --> 28:09.534
and that's why
you're still running.

28:09.567 --> 28:10.600
I'm not doing this.

28:10.634 --> 28:13.600
I made you happy, Joanna!

28:13.634 --> 28:15.600
And that scared you.

28:15.634 --> 28:18.534
So you pushed me
out of your life,

28:18.567 --> 28:21.100
because you'd rather
be numb inside

28:21.134 --> 28:22.534
than risk getting hurt.

28:22.567 --> 28:23.767
You think I'm numb?

28:23.800 --> 28:25.367
My whole life is grief.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.867
I love my girls more
than anything else,

28:27.900 --> 28:31.700
and I have to watch them
die again and again.

28:31.734 --> 28:34.534
And it doesn't get easier.
It gets worse.

28:34.567 --> 28:36.067
I'm cursed, Alex.
Can't you just understand that?

28:36.100 --> 28:38.067
I know you're cursed.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.600
I don't care.
I never did!

28:39.634 --> 28:41.934
Because you never
had to see it.

28:41.967 --> 28:43.200
You never had to
live through it,

28:43.234 --> 28:46.034
because I kept you from it.

28:46.067 --> 28:50.767
It was never about you not being
strong enough to handle it.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.200
I didn't want you to have
to share in my suffering

28:53.234 --> 28:55.600
and I didn't want you
to have to see it.

28:55.634 --> 28:58.400
I pushed you away
because I loved you.

28:58.434 --> 29:00.934
So you killed what we had

29:00.967 --> 29:02.734
because you thought
you were protecting me?

29:02.767 --> 29:04.800
I know I was.

29:06.134 --> 29:08.200
All this time,
I thought you hurt me.

29:08.234 --> 29:10.634
But you know what, Joanna?

29:11.934 --> 29:13.300
You hurt yourself.

29:19.467 --> 29:23.434
Okay, it says we have to boil
the baby's breath in the oil.

29:23.467 --> 29:25.900
And if this doesn't work,
we can't kill it?

29:25.934 --> 29:28.000
We'll figure something else out.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.067
It'll work. It has to.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.600
Light the feathers on fire;
we need the ash.

29:36.767 --> 29:38.334
Oh, no.

29:38.367 --> 29:40.334
What?
Freya didn't text
the last page.

29:40.367 --> 29:43.167
We can't finish the spell
without the last page.
Do you think

29:43.200 --> 29:45.167
she's all right?
She damn well better
be all right,

29:45.200 --> 29:46.734
so I can kill her
when she gets back.

29:46.767 --> 29:48.834
Don't pull out the knives
just yet.

29:48.867 --> 29:50.567
I'll kill you later.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.867
Sweetie, you look like
you've been through hell.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.500
Hell would have been
a lot more pleasant.

29:53.534 --> 29:55.334
Please tell me you got
a look at the last page.

29:55.367 --> 29:57.400
Even better.
Hey, guys.

29:57.434 --> 29:59.200
Dash.
DASH:
How can I help?

29:59.234 --> 30:01.567
Last person I
expected to see.
Well, we had a little, uh...

30:01.600 --> 30:04.167
Issue‐‐ with some
Mandragora venom.
That's right!

30:04.200 --> 30:05.734
He attacked you!
It's all right.

30:05.767 --> 30:07.567
I managed to break the spell.
She stabbed me

30:07.600 --> 30:10.067
in the brain.
They got me, too‐‐
right through the ear.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.367
It hurts, right? Oh, God.
Like a mother!

30:12.400 --> 30:13.900
INGRID:
Oh, I'm so glad
you're okay.

30:13.934 --> 30:15.900
Guys, we need to get
back to the spell.

30:15.934 --> 30:17.500
(yells, groans)

30:17.534 --> 30:19.234
What's wrong?
The Mandragora.

30:19.267 --> 30:20.834
He's here.
I can feel it.

30:20.867 --> 30:22.167
You okay?

30:22.200 --> 30:24.167
INGRID:
He's coming for me.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.100
He'll never let you
take me from him.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.934
(panting)

30:32.967 --> 30:36.434
You are running
me ragged.

30:36.467 --> 30:37.600
Sorry.

30:37.634 --> 30:40.734
No... no, in the best
possible way.

30:40.767 --> 30:42.934
(exhales)

30:46.134 --> 30:47.567
What are you doing?

30:47.600 --> 30:48.634
Shh.

30:50.434 --> 30:52.367
Ow! Aah.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.634
Kind of hurts.
Part of the fun.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.234
(exhales)

31:02.900 --> 31:04.467
Better?

31:07.634 --> 31:10.900
Okay. Now close your eyes.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.967
♪ ♪

31:23.867 --> 31:25.600
(whispering):
Has de mi una madre.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.200
Una madre. Una madre.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.067
(panting quietly)

31:37.100 --> 31:38.967
(moans)

31:46.234 --> 31:48.000
Can you guess

31:48.034 --> 31:51.000
what I'm thinking right now?

31:51.034 --> 31:53.567
No. No, I really can't.

31:56.534 --> 31:59.234
There's still a lot
I don't know about you.

32:00.934 --> 32:02.400
Good.

32:03.734 --> 32:04.900
Let's go another round.

32:06.900 --> 32:08.500
(grunts in pain)
WENDY:
Hold her still.

32:08.534 --> 32:09.667
Okay.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.000
To the spirits
above and below,

32:12.034 --> 32:15.367
free this soul
from her unnatural bond.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.900
Vinculum abrumperes.

32:16.934 --> 32:18.334
INGRID:
He's here.

32:18.367 --> 32:19.534
He's come for me.

32:19.567 --> 32:22.867
Vinculum abrumperes. Ah...

32:22.900 --> 32:24.700
(rumbling, clattering)
What the hell was that?

32:24.734 --> 32:26.367
WENDY: Either the biggest
squirrel on earth, or...

32:26.400 --> 32:27.867
The Mandragora.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.000
Okay, cover her entire body

32:31.034 --> 32:32.200
with this oil.

32:32.234 --> 32:33.834
And then what?

32:33.867 --> 32:34.834
Okay, this is gonna
sound terrible.

32:34.867 --> 32:35.834
Don't freak out.

32:35.867 --> 32:36.867
Oh, God.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.334
We need to set
her on fire.

32:38.367 --> 32:39.900
Are you kidding?
INGRID:
What?! Why?

32:39.934 --> 32:42.234
According to the spell,
if you move at all,

32:42.267 --> 32:44.400
you'll be burned, but if
you stay completely still,

32:44.434 --> 32:47.400
the fire will consume the oil
and disappear‐‐ along with your

32:47.434 --> 32:50.834
connection to it.
What if I can't stay
perfectly still?

32:50.867 --> 32:51.867
You better.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.000
Can I breathe?

32:53.034 --> 32:54.000
Try not to.

32:54.034 --> 32:55.334
As soon as the oil
is gone,

32:55.367 --> 32:56.567
the symbiosis
will be fully broken,

32:56.600 --> 32:58.000
and we can finally kill
the sucker.

32:58.034 --> 33:00.034
(rumbling, scraping, banging)

33:00.067 --> 33:01.667
Okay.
WENDY:
Where are you going?

33:01.700 --> 33:02.900
I'm gonna deal with that damn
thing once and for all.

33:02.934 --> 33:04.334
No, you're not.

33:04.367 --> 33:06.000
Stay here.
You still don't trust me.

33:06.034 --> 33:07.734
Even at a time like this.

33:07.767 --> 33:09.200
Especially at a time like this.

33:09.234 --> 33:11.200
Finish coating her‐‐
I'll stall it

33:11.234 --> 33:13.234
for as long as I can.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.734
Seriously? A broom?

33:16.767 --> 33:18.667
Until the spell's broken
and Ingrid's free,

33:18.700 --> 33:21.067
that's all I'm willing to risk.

33:38.900 --> 33:40.567
(grunts)

33:41.734 --> 33:42.567
(gasps)

33:44.367 --> 33:46.867
(grunting)

33:46.900 --> 33:49.700
(screams)

33:49.734 --> 33:53.034
FREYA:
Hunc dimittis...

33:53.067 --> 33:54.700
animae.

33:54.734 --> 33:56.400
Hunc dimittis...

34:06.600 --> 34:08.067
Animae.

34:08.100 --> 34:09.534
Dimittis.

34:09.567 --> 34:11.200
(pants)

34:12.900 --> 34:14.400
(pants)

34:19.867 --> 34:22.467
(low, deep whirring)

34:25.367 --> 34:26.834
Come on.

34:26.867 --> 34:28.534
Are you okay?

34:28.567 --> 34:29.867
Yeah.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.000
I think so.
I think it worked.

34:32.034 --> 34:35.067
(relieved sigh)
I can't sense him.

34:35.100 --> 34:38.267
I don't... I don't feel
the connection anymore.
Oh, thank God.

34:39.867 --> 34:41.567
We did it!

34:41.600 --> 34:43.867
(Mandragora growling, snarling)

34:44.934 --> 34:47.000
No! No!

34:47.034 --> 34:49.867
(Mandragora roaring in pain)

34:49.900 --> 34:50.867
(grunts)

34:50.900 --> 34:52.267
Forach Deyna!

35:06.600 --> 35:09.834
You saved me.

35:09.867 --> 35:11.700
You sound surprised.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.667
Thank you.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.934
You're welcome, Aunt Wendy.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.834
Did you feel that?

35:35.867 --> 35:37.200
I did.

35:37.234 --> 35:38.867
The Mandragora must be dead.

35:38.900 --> 35:41.367
Its venom's not working
on us anymore.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.734
Oh, my God. Ingrid.

35:45.200 --> 35:49.000
Llena me con tu virilidad.

35:49.034 --> 35:51.767
Has de mi una madre.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.567
(whispers):
You're going to give me a baby.

36:20.257 --> 36:22.757
How is she?
She's asleep.
She needs it.

36:22.790 --> 36:24.790
She's been through a lot.
Yeah.

36:27.590 --> 36:29.390
Thank you...

36:29.424 --> 36:31.590
for saving Wendy...

36:31.624 --> 36:33.590
and Mom, with the argenteum.

36:33.624 --> 36:35.424
You're two for two.

36:38.024 --> 36:41.490
I'm sorry I let the Zurkas
color my view of you.

36:41.524 --> 36:43.557
That wasn't fair.

36:43.590 --> 36:46.157
Whatever happened in the past...

36:46.190 --> 36:48.390
you are still my twin,

36:48.424 --> 36:50.324
no matter what.

36:50.357 --> 36:52.557
Thank you, Freya.

36:52.590 --> 36:55.424
That means everything to me.

36:55.457 --> 36:57.657
You look like
you could use a beer.

36:57.690 --> 36:59.757
We all could.

36:59.790 --> 37:01.457
Hey, Mom.
Is everyone okay?

37:01.490 --> 37:02.557
Yes.

37:02.590 --> 37:03.890
Where's Ingrid?

37:03.924 --> 37:05.557
She's fine.
She's resting.
Okay.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.957
I need to go see her.
She's okay.

37:06.990 --> 37:08.824
She's asleep.

37:08.857 --> 37:10.557
You should've
seen your son.

37:10.590 --> 37:12.790
He killed the Mandragora.

37:12.824 --> 37:14.290
Seriously?

37:14.324 --> 37:16.257
Yeah.
Kinda.

37:16.290 --> 37:17.524
"Kinda"?

37:24.490 --> 37:28.724
So we're all finally safe
from that thing, huh?

37:28.757 --> 37:31.424
Nightmare over.

37:34.657 --> 37:37.390
Can we finally have a
boring Sunday, please?

37:37.424 --> 37:38.957
Yes. Cheers to that.
Cheers.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.924
Cheers to that.

37:45.357 --> 37:48.224
FREYA: You just gonna leave
without saying good‐bye?

37:48.257 --> 37:50.424
I...

37:50.457 --> 37:52.757
I just didn't want to intrude.

37:52.790 --> 37:56.390
I should go.
Do you remember
what you said to me

37:56.424 --> 37:57.724
when you were...

37:57.757 --> 38:00.657
well, basically
trying to kill me?

38:00.690 --> 38:02.657
I know I said horrible things.
Yeah.

38:02.690 --> 38:05.457
You did.

38:05.490 --> 38:07.557
Freya...

38:07.590 --> 38:09.890
if you say you
didn't sleep with Killian

38:09.924 --> 38:12.257
while you were with me...

38:12.290 --> 38:14.424
then I believe you.

38:14.457 --> 38:17.324
Good.
And look,
for what it's worth...

38:17.357 --> 38:21.224
those things
I said about your job

38:21.257 --> 38:24.757
and your family...
I didn't mean it.

38:24.790 --> 38:28.257
I was always proud
to be with you.

38:28.290 --> 38:30.890
Thanks.

38:30.924 --> 38:32.790
Yeah.

38:32.824 --> 38:35.224
Just one more thing.

38:35.257 --> 38:38.390
You had said something...

38:38.424 --> 38:41.890
about doing bad things.

38:41.924 --> 38:44.290
What?
You had said that

38:44.324 --> 38:47.090
I had no idea what
you were capable of,

38:47.124 --> 38:51.224
and that you had done things
that would make me shudder.

38:51.257 --> 38:52.490
Freya...

38:52.524 --> 38:55.224
I was under a spell.

38:55.257 --> 38:57.290
I mean, I was literally insane.

38:57.324 --> 39:00.424
I‐I didn't mean a word
of anything I said.

39:03.024 --> 39:05.157
It's okay‐‐
I'll show myself out.

39:15.790 --> 39:17.424
Hey.

39:17.457 --> 39:19.657
I figured we could
both use one of these.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.390
Joanna...

39:21.424 --> 39:23.824
Do you have to leave so soon?
The Mandragora's gone,

39:23.857 --> 39:25.424
your family's safe,

39:25.457 --> 39:27.390
and I have a life
to get back to in New York.

39:27.424 --> 39:28.824
But we should talk.

39:28.857 --> 39:30.824
So talk.

39:42.524 --> 39:46.390
I know I screwed it up
all those years ago.

39:46.424 --> 39:48.724
And you were right‐‐
I didn't just hurt you,

39:48.757 --> 39:51.024
I... I hurt myself.

39:53.290 --> 39:56.490
(chuckles): Seeing you again,
it's... it's made me realize

39:56.524 --> 39:58.924
we really did have
a good thing.

39:58.957 --> 40:01.257
(laughs softly)

40:01.290 --> 40:04.257
I know I can be
closed off, Alex.

40:04.290 --> 40:06.257
I've missed you, very much.

40:06.290 --> 40:08.957
I've missed you, too.

40:08.990 --> 40:11.157
More than you know.

40:14.757 --> 40:17.224
(wry laugh)

40:17.257 --> 40:19.924
But you hurt me, Joanna.
Yeah, I...

40:19.957 --> 40:21.424
I understand‐‐ I screwed it up.

40:21.457 --> 40:23.090
You were right to leave.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.157
I just... I want you to know

40:27.190 --> 40:29.224
how much you've meant to me.

40:29.257 --> 40:32.257
And I am so sorry
that I hurt you.

40:32.290 --> 40:34.324
I think the fact that
you were even just willing

40:34.357 --> 40:35.924
to come back here and...

40:35.957 --> 40:40.057
help after the way
I left things, it just...

40:40.090 --> 40:42.657
says so much
about who you are.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.824
It...

40:53.424 --> 40:55.524
You still talk too much.

41:04.624 --> 41:07.724
We really did have
a good thing.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.790
Don't forget that.

41:13.524 --> 41:16.424
Oh...

41:28.490 --> 41:30.924
(grunting)

41:36.790 --> 41:38.690
I'm sorry.

41:40.357 --> 41:42.124
I know I let you down.

41:43.524 --> 41:45.790
I'll find another way.

41:45.824 --> 41:48.157
I promise, Grandfather.
I promise.
