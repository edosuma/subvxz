[ominous music]

00:09.634 --> 00:16.558

00:26.651 --> 00:33.575
* *

00:42.083 --> 00:45.211
[hooting and hollering]

00:45.253 --> 00:48.715
[light acoustic music]

00:48.757 --> 00:51.343
- Wait up, I'm coming!
- Let's go!

00:51.384 --> 00:54.554
- No.
- Don't be lame, Emma.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.890
- Keep your bra on.
- Come on!

00:56.931 --> 00:59.309
- No, no.
[all cheering]

00:59.351 --> 01:00.560
- Absolutely not.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.897
I can't think
of anything more awful.

01:03.938 --> 01:08.485
- They dump raw sewage
in there all the time.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.821
That sea is just
teemin' with turds.

01:11.863 --> 01:14.366
- It's teemin' with doo-doo.
- [laughs]

01:14.407 --> 01:15.992
- You know, I had a friend who,

01:16.034 --> 01:18.411
uh, went swimming
in these waters,

01:18.453 --> 01:20.997
and he got flesh-eating
bacteria, and he died.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.248
- I heard about that.
I'm sorry.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.043
- Yeah, no,
he had that shit comin'--

01:25.085 --> 01:27.712
out here takin' risks.
- [laughs]

01:29.130 --> 01:30.590
Love a good pool, though.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.926
- Pools are wonderful.
- Yeah, I like pools.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.345
* *

01:35.387 --> 01:37.138
- You want a hot toddy?

01:37.180 --> 01:38.932
- Does it come
in a cool thermos?

01:38.973 --> 01:41.434
- Oh, my God.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.186
It totally does.
- Okay,

01:43.228 --> 01:45.480
then I--then I do.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.690
- Okay.

01:46.731 --> 01:50.860
* *

01:50.902 --> 01:52.112
All right.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.279
* *

01:53.321 --> 01:54.864
- Here you go.
[pouring]

01:54.906 --> 01:57.158
- Thank you.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.119
A hot turdy.
- Hot turdy.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.079
- [giggles]

02:01.121 --> 02:03.164
- Hot turdy
for the dirty turkeys.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.958
- [laughs]

02:05.000 --> 02:08.378
* *

02:08.420 --> 02:10.880
- I'm Noah, by the way.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.340
- I'm Emma.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.009
* *

02:14.050 --> 02:15.969
- Emma.
- Yeah.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.804
* *

02:17.846 --> 02:20.140
I just got out of a long-term
relationship, though...

02:20.181 --> 02:23.518
* *

02:23.560 --> 02:26.771
Because he died
from a flesh-eating virus

02:26.813 --> 02:28.815
that he caught from swimming
in that doo-doo water.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.735
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.528
A manatee passed him...
- [laughs]

02:33.570 --> 02:36.197
- Opened his mouth,
got a turd in there.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.242
- She was like,
"Oh, manatees, ahh!"

02:39.284 --> 02:42.162
[both laughing]
- And then that was--

02:42.203 --> 02:48.626
* *

02:48.668 --> 02:50.795
Hey, so, uh, what do you say

02:50.837 --> 02:55.467
we, like,
ditch all of our friends here

02:55.508 --> 02:58.970
and we just,
like, go find a pool?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.055
- I'd like that.

03:00.096 --> 03:07.228
* *

03:12.067 --> 03:14.861
- Uh-huh.
Until--

03:16.654 --> 03:18.531
And what time
does the bus leave?

03:18.573 --> 03:21.201
El autobús?
Mm-hmm.

03:21.242 --> 03:24.329
Oh, and that's it?

03:24.371 --> 03:29.209
Todos?
Okay--uh, gracias.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.503
[sighs]
Okay, let's go.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.464
[tense percussive music]

03:34.506 --> 03:37.550
* *

03:37.592 --> 03:38.968
- Ah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:39.010 --> 03:40.136
- Ah!
[gasps]

03:40.178 --> 03:42.514
Oh!

03:42.555 --> 03:44.599
- I think I may be concussed.
- Oh, fuck.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.601
- And also potentially
sprained my neck.

03:46.643 --> 03:47.727
- Uh-huh.
- I don't know

03:47.769 --> 03:49.521
if that's a thing, but, like,

03:49.562 --> 03:51.398
I'm going to turn, and
I'm not gettin' a whole lot.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.732
- Yup.
- Mobility-wise.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.235
- Here, just keep
pressure on it, okay?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.445
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.322
- I like your room.
- Thank you.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.409
- It's nice.
- Thank you!

04:02.450 --> 04:04.452
- You think it's a suite?
- Definitely a suite.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.371
My dad's in the upgrade.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.914
- Hey, who's Illán Iberra?

04:07.956 --> 04:10.875
- [grunting]

04:13.294 --> 04:15.088
Hey, no, no, no.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.089
No.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.299
* *

04:18.341 --> 04:19.926
Okay.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.803
* *

04:21.845 --> 04:23.722
Oh, fuck!
- What, what, is it bad?

04:23.763 --> 04:25.348
- No, that's a lot of blood.

04:25.390 --> 04:29.436
Uh, oh, fuck.
Yeah, um, just hold on.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.688
I need a towel.
[groans]

04:31.730 --> 04:34.065
- It really doesn't hurt as
much as it looks like it would.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.900
- I think you need
to go to the hospital.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.944
- You know what?
I really don't like hospitals.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.320
- Yeah, well, nobody--
- It's just that the lighting's

04:39.362 --> 04:41.239
shitty, and you kind of feel
like you're gonna die

04:41.281 --> 04:42.198
when you're in there,
so maybe--

04:42.240 --> 04:43.700
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.410
- Okay.
- Okay, I'm still

04:45.452 --> 04:46.786
a little bit dizzy.
- Oh, yeah, obviously.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.705
- And also potentially gonna
throw up a little bit.

04:48.747 --> 04:49.914
- Oh, please, go that way.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.249
- I'm gonna try not
to do that--

04:51.291 --> 04:53.043
- Don't look at me.
- But that's a possibility.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.128
- [groans]
- Just to put it on your radar.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.129
- Good?
- Good.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.964
- Okay.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.258
* *

05:00.300 --> 05:01.384
Let me just--

05:03.178 --> 05:07.766
Oh. [groans]
Ew.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.809
Here.

05:09.851 --> 05:13.313
Sorry I, uh, forgot to put
deodorant on,

05:13.355 --> 05:15.648
and you're kinda
in the danger zone, so--

05:15.690 --> 05:17.025
- It's all right.
I think I completely

05:17.067 --> 05:18.276
lost my sense of smell.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.778
- That's not good.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.322
- [exhales]
Must be--I've been told

05:22.364 --> 05:24.949
I have, like, a big head.
- Mm-hmm.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.785
- Proportionately
to the rest of my body,

05:26.826 --> 05:28.953
so I'm hoping that means
that I just have--

05:28.995 --> 05:30.497
- Okay, all right.
- Like, more blood to lose,

05:30.538 --> 05:32.707
volume-wise.
- Shut up, please.

05:32.749 --> 05:36.544
I'm gonna superglue
your head back together, so--

05:36.586 --> 05:39.297
- [chuckles]

05:39.339 --> 05:41.257
Oh, you're not kidding?
- No.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.093
It's sturdier than stitches.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.011
- Okay,
have you done that before, or?

05:45.053 --> 05:49.057
- No. [scoffs]
But I've had it done before.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.767
I used to play hockey
in high school,

05:50.809 --> 05:55.814
and my dad had to glue my head
a ton, so count to three.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.524
- Is there any, like,
sanitation process

05:57.565 --> 05:59.025
we need to do, or,
before you start,

05:59.067 --> 06:00.527
or are you just gonna--
- It's a little late for that,

06:00.568 --> 06:01.611
my guy.
- You don't need, like,

06:01.653 --> 06:04.906
a specific glue to start?
- No--okay.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.658
Oh, my God.
It's so long.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.910
Okay, there we go.
- [sighs]

06:11.913 --> 06:13.957
- Just gonna pinch her shut.
[wound sloshing]

06:13.998 --> 06:17.836
- [inhales sharply, exhales]
- Ooh.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.797
- [panting]

06:22.507 --> 06:25.218
I'm Violet.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.804
- I'm Sam.

06:27.846 --> 06:31.516
- [chuckles]
- Good start.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.601
Sorry if this ruined
your plans.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.563
- Yeah, it did,
but um, it's fine.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.524
[light music]

06:39.566 --> 06:44.612
* *

06:44.654 --> 06:47.657
- Okay, thanks.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.577
- Uh, hey, do you wanna
put your number in?

06:50.618 --> 06:52.037
You know,
so I can check in on you?

06:52.078 --> 06:54.414
In case you die,
I can erase any evidence.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.916
- Yeah, good thinking.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.543
I mean,
putting my number in your phone

06:58.585 --> 06:59.961
might kind of just
connect us more, but--

07:00.003 --> 07:01.796
- No, you don't have to--
- No, no, no, no--good.

07:01.838 --> 07:05.717
It's good for you to have.
That's a--that's a me.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.052
- That's a you.
[both laugh]

07:07.093 --> 07:08.595
- I don't know
why I said it like that.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.929
Okay.
- Thank you.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.139
- Thanks.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.433
* *

07:13.475 --> 07:15.060
- Bye.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.229
- Shit,
where'd my skateboard go?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.150
[phone buzzing]

07:23.610 --> 07:24.819
- Okay, here we go--
first text.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.113
"Hey, this is my number."

07:27.155 --> 07:29.616
- Should we be reading this?
- Yeah, of course we should.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.117
- Okay, all right.
- Okay.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.660
- Um, all right, cool.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.245
"Did I leave my skateboard
in your room?"

07:34.287 --> 07:35.663
- "Not here, just checked."

07:35.705 --> 07:37.499
- "That's so weird.
I think someone stole it."

07:37.540 --> 07:38.625
- Okay, so many questions
already.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.001
But missing skateboard--fuck.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.336
- All right, keep goin'.
- Okay.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.962
- "That sucks. I suppose
we were a bit distracted."

07:43.004 --> 07:44.714
- "Ha ha, yeah,
that was fun."

07:44.756 --> 07:45.757
- Oh, so they hooked up
right away?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.926
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, "Sorry,

07:47.967 --> 07:50.303
I am inexperienced
in the head department."

07:50.345 --> 07:52.347
- Ooh! Um--

07:52.389 --> 07:53.431
- Straight to oral.
- Yeah.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.724
- Good for her.
- Good for him.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.644
- Okay, "Did it dry yet?"
- Um, "Yeah, but my hair

07:57.686 --> 07:59.062
is a little sticky."
What?

07:59.104 --> 08:01.314
- Oh, my God.
- "I'm sorry I left

08:01.356 --> 08:03.817
a gross mess."
- "Most of it ended up on me.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.944
A little on the couch."
- Oh, no.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.654
"Some of it got in my eye--"
Oh, my--

08:07.696 --> 08:08.988
- Ew...
- Okay, all right, maybe

08:09.030 --> 08:10.782
we shouldn't be reading this.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.536
[quirky music]

08:14.577 --> 08:16.621
Okay--oh, Jesus--
"It felt pretty deep."

08:16.663 --> 08:17.914
- "Yeah, it was hard
not to gag."

08:17.956 --> 08:19.791
- Wow, they're perverts.
- Yeah.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.042
- They're like--but what's
weird is that they're porny.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.460
- Yeah.
- I didn't expect that.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.753
- I know, I know, yeah.
- I didn't think they'd be,

08:23.795 --> 08:25.088
like, all porny.
- I know, I don't think

08:25.130 --> 08:27.007
I like them. I don't think I
like 'em. I don't--

08:27.048 --> 08:29.217
have you ever, like,
texted anybody like that?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.262
- No.
- Okay.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.638
- Because you have to assume

08:33.680 --> 08:34.723
that people are
gonna read your texts.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.725
Okay, here's our first photo.
Ready?

08:36.766 --> 08:38.893
- Okay, yeah.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.020
- [gasps]
- Ohh! No, no.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.188
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, little kids.

08:42.230 --> 08:46.026
Um, why--what the fuck
am I looking at?

08:46.067 --> 08:49.612
"A little headache,
but the glue worked."

08:49.654 --> 08:51.072
- Oh, my God.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.074
It's, like, a skull.
Like, a--

08:53.116 --> 08:55.243
That's Sam's bloody...
- Oh, God, okay.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.580
- Glued skull.
So that's--that, okay.

08:58.621 --> 09:02.000
- Yeah.
- Well, then that makes sense.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.585
Yeah.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.795
So we're the perverts.
- Yeah.

09:05.837 --> 09:06.963
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.298
"Keep an eye out
for my skateboard.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.883
"I think the security guard
with the fancy suit

09:09.924 --> 09:11.718
must have taken it."
- Okay, security.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.470
So that's a person of interest.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.181
- Yeah.
- Okay, uh--

09:16.222 --> 09:18.058
"Do you want to track
him down?"

09:18.099 --> 09:20.769
- "I can't tonight. Tomorrow?"

09:20.810 --> 09:23.396
- And then she doesn't respond.
That's so weird.

09:23.438 --> 09:27.275
But then she doesn't text him
again until 4:00 a.m.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.860
on the 26th.
- Yeah.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.862
- She says, "Don't fuck
with the yellow snake.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.572
It has four noses."

09:32.614 --> 09:35.575
[eerie music]

09:35.617 --> 09:41.164
* *

09:41.206 --> 09:43.124
- Okay, so they do have
yellow vipers here.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.250
- Mm-hmm.
- But they do not have

09:44.292 --> 09:45.919
four noses.
However, there is this

09:45.960 --> 09:47.253
particular Yucatecan thing,

09:47.295 --> 09:49.839
which does have four noses,
but is not yellow.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.133
So I don't know.
I guess it's possible

09:52.175 --> 09:54.344
that Sam and Violet could have
crossed with this, like,

09:54.386 --> 09:57.597
hybrid poisonous, four-nosed
yellow snake.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.266
But I don't think it's likely--
what are you doing?

10:00.308 --> 10:01.309
- I'm calling the police.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.477
- Wait,
I thought we said no cops.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.687
- No, no, no.

10:03.728 --> 10:04.771
I'm not gonna
tell them anything.

10:04.813 --> 10:05.980
- [speaking Spanish]

10:06.022 --> 10:10.443
- Hi, hello.
My name is...Maya Ruins,

10:10.485 --> 10:12.278
and I'm calling
from the "New York Times,"

10:12.320 --> 10:16.700
and I would like to speak
to Detective Silverio Narro

10:16.741 --> 10:18.201
regarding an old case.
- Silverio Narro

10:18.243 --> 10:19.661
hasn't been here
in quince años.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.080
- Oh, 15 years ago?
[mouthing]

10:22.122 --> 10:23.998
- What case is this regarding?

10:24.040 --> 10:27.669
- Yes, you know, would it be
possible for you to tell us

10:27.711 --> 10:29.129
where we could find him now?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.089
- Last I heard, he had a
[speaking Spanish]

10:31.131 --> 10:33.800
- Punta Venado.
[whispers] Punta Venado.

10:33.842 --> 10:34.884
- [whispers] Punta Venado.
- Anything else

10:34.926 --> 10:35.969
I can help you?
- Uh, no, that's it.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.345
Thank you so much
for your help.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.472
Actually, you know what?
I do have one more question.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.434
Does the phrase, "Don't fuck
with the yellow snake--

10:42.475 --> 10:45.770
it has four noses"
mean anything to you?

10:45.812 --> 10:47.856
Hello?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.482
[line clicks]
[phone beeps]

10:49.524 --> 10:51.443
[eerie music]

10:51.484 --> 10:53.403
He hung up.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.988
- Hey, Raul?
- Huh?

10:55.030 --> 10:56.698
- It's Raul, right?
- Oh, yeah, yes.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.825
- Yeah, Noah. Hey, um--
- Hi, Raul.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.785
- Yeah, can I ask you
a question?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.162
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
That's why I'm here.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.371
- Have you ever
heard the phrase,

11:03.413 --> 11:06.207
"Don't fuck with
the yellow snake--it has--"

11:06.249 --> 11:07.417
- "Four noses."
- Yeah.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.543
- Oh, that's Frias.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.502
- What is that?
- Yeah.

11:09.544 --> 11:10.545
- What's "Frias"?

11:10.587 --> 11:11.796
- Frias is the yellow snake.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.006
- I don't understand
what that--yeah.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.716
- I don't understand.
- Let me show you.

11:14.758 --> 11:15.675
- Yo, yo, yo, wait.
- Oh!

11:15.717 --> 11:17.010
both: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:17.052 --> 11:18.053
- Look, look, look.
- Okay, no, no, no.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.888
Look, look.
You see?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.389
- Oh, the yellow snake.
- You see?

11:21.431 --> 11:23.350
- Oh, it's an underwear brand.
- Oh, no.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.478
Frias is an empire.
It's not only clothes.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.564
It's everything. Politics,
real estate, you know?

11:29.606 --> 11:32.859
- Oh, okay, so, like, why don't
you fuck with the yellow snake?

11:32.901 --> 11:34.444
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna be fucked

11:34.486 --> 11:37.405
by a yellow snake?
- No, no, I do not.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.950
* *

11:40.992 --> 11:44.704
- If you cross the yellow
snake, it sniff you out--

11:44.746 --> 11:46.539
[imitates biting]
Puncture you, huh?

11:46.581 --> 11:47.707
Cuidado.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.918
* *

11:54.547 --> 11:57.092
- It says here that
the Frias is a dynasty

11:57.133 --> 11:59.928
of tailors,
clothiers, and designers

11:59.969 --> 12:02.931
spanning four generations
in the Yucatan.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.642
- Okay,
so here's something I found.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.144
It's a little flow chart
about how detectives--

12:08.186 --> 12:10.188
- No, we don't need to be
googling how detectives work.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.108
I think we should be
following our instincts.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.652
- Okay, well, what are
your instincts telling you?

12:15.694 --> 12:19.489
- Well, we know that, um,
Sam was missing his skateboard.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.324
We know that they were
in someone else's room

12:21.366 --> 12:23.326
at 5:30 in the morning,
and we know that they had this

12:23.368 --> 12:24.911
weird obsession
with a yellow snake.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.329
So I think that
that's the thread

12:26.371 --> 12:28.123
that we should be pulling.
- Well, I don't know.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.749
I mean, maybe we should
be heeding the warning

12:29.791 --> 12:31.126
to not fuck with them.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.795
- No, because that's what
makes them seem so guilty.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.088
Oh, my God.

12:35.130 --> 12:38.091
- What, what?
- I--okay.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.427
I think the Frias family
owns the resort.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.012
- What?
- Yeah, I'm almost positive.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.930
I'm pretty sure that I saw them

12:43.972 --> 12:46.016
on a sign at the Oceana Vista
last night.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.684
- Hang on.
Yeah, but you went

12:47.726 --> 12:50.520
to an abandoned resort
in Mexico alone at night?

12:50.562 --> 12:52.105
- I didn't go alone.
The cab driver was there.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.691
- Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?

12:54.733 --> 12:57.193
That is the dumbest thing!
- I didn't go inside.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.071
- Emma, we are tourists here!
We are not detectives!

13:01.114 --> 13:03.324
- Take the tour, then.

13:04.284 --> 13:08.121
- Okay, can we get two more
shots of tequila, please?

13:08.163 --> 13:09.706
Okay, you know what I think?

13:09.748 --> 13:13.877
I think we need to go and talk
to someone in the Frias world.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.045
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

13:15.086 --> 13:16.171
- That's what I think too.
- Okay.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.130
- I think that's
a really great idea.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.131
- Yeah, let's see what the fuck

13:18.173 --> 13:19.215
is up with this yellow snake.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.508
- Yeah, because
I wanna know why

13:20.550 --> 13:21.968
you can't fuck with it.
- Yeah, and see if it

13:22.010 --> 13:23.345
really has four noses.
- Yeah.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.637
- Yeah!
- Yeah, I mean, that could be

13:24.679 --> 13:25.889
bullshit, but yeah,
let's go talk to them.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.807
- Okay.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.392
- There we go.
Here we go.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.727
- [grunts]
- You ready?

13:30.769 --> 13:32.062
- Yeah.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.356
All right.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.652
[door creaks open]

13:42.364 --> 13:44.074
- Hola.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.117
Gracias.
- Hola, hola.

13:54.876 --> 13:58.004
So is this a store
or a museum?

13:58.046 --> 14:01.549
- Izamal legend tells
of Orelliano Frias' encounter

14:01.591 --> 14:03.677
with a rare yellow snake
with four noses.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.512
- Oh, that's the snake!
- Frias was known

14:05.553 --> 14:08.848
throughout the region
as the king of henequen fiber.

14:08.890 --> 14:12.268
But it was Orelliano's only
daughter, Beatriz Frias,

14:12.310 --> 14:14.562
who created
the fashion empire.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.399
Combining pashmina wool
and henequen fiber,

14:17.440 --> 14:19.442
she created unique collections

14:19.484 --> 14:21.569
that stitched
the iconic Frias label

14:21.611 --> 14:24.406
into the history
of the peninsula.

14:24.447 --> 14:27.617
From the suit the governor
put on as he was sworn in,

14:27.659 --> 14:30.704
all the way to the dress
Miss Yucatan wore

14:30.745 --> 14:34.416
when she was crowned
Miss Universe.

14:34.457 --> 14:39.337
Frias is everywhere, and
everywhere is better for it.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.048
- Frias is everywhere.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.591
May I offer you a drink?

14:43.633 --> 14:46.803
Complements from my private
distillery, Frias Añejo.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.138
[dramatic music]

14:48.179 --> 14:50.223
- Yes.
- Oh, we good.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.641
- Gracias.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.393
* *

14:53.435 --> 14:54.894
- Do you have an appointment?

14:54.936 --> 14:58.148
- Oh, my God, that's so good.
Um, an appointment?

14:58.189 --> 14:59.858
No, but you know what?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.776
* *

15:01.818 --> 15:07.073
I...love this dress.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.909
* *

15:09.951 --> 15:11.327
- Would you like
one of our tailors

15:11.369 --> 15:12.537
to take your measurement?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.831
* *

15:14.873 --> 15:17.208
- Um...

15:17.250 --> 15:18.835
you know...

15:18.877 --> 15:24.132
* *

15:24.174 --> 15:26.092
Um...

15:26.134 --> 15:30.055
* *

15:30.096 --> 15:33.433
Do you wanna take
my measurement? Hmm?

15:33.475 --> 15:35.101
Hmm?
- [chuckles]

15:36.144 --> 15:37.687
- Mm.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.398
- Mm.
- Sure.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.651
- Veintiocho.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.281
Apologies for my pace.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.699
I'm still an apprentice.

15:49.741 --> 15:54.496
- You're doing great, Caesar.
- Okay, 32, perfect.

15:54.537 --> 15:57.082
- Hey, do you know anything

15:57.123 --> 16:01.086
about the, um, Oceana Vista?

16:01.127 --> 16:03.088
[suspenseful music]

16:03.129 --> 16:05.215
- Um--

16:05.256 --> 16:08.760
I--I don't know.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.303
Ooh.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.847
- [whispering] I think--hey.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.265
I think you do know.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.562
- Hey, you get commissions?

16:19.604 --> 16:22.691
- Uh, turn around.
- You can talk to us, you know?

16:22.732 --> 16:25.151
We'll buy that dress.
- Yeah.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.696
* *

16:27.737 --> 16:30.740
[clattering]
[indistinct chatter]

16:30.782 --> 16:32.909
- It's mostly rumors.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.453
There is a conflict between
the Frias and the resort.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.872
As you may have heard,
the Frias have a vengeful side,

16:37.914 --> 16:39.457
and they're always listening.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.003
Um--
- What kind of conflict?

16:43.044 --> 16:45.588
- A member of the Frias family
used to work at the resort.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.257
- Who?

16:49.634 --> 16:51.428
- If you look up photos
of the Frias family--

16:51.469 --> 16:52.512
- Mm-hmm?
- You won't see

16:52.554 --> 16:54.514
Beatriz's youngest son.

16:54.556 --> 16:58.351
But if you look up
photos of Oceana Vista,

16:58.393 --> 17:00.854
then you will see him.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.856
We don't talk about him much.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.859
He was a master tailor,
the best there ever was.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.194
Even better than Beatriz.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.988
But he threw it all away.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.115
- What's his name?

17:12.157 --> 17:14.117
- Um--
[whispers] no.

17:14.159 --> 17:15.785
- Caesar.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.370
Hey.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.123
Give us one name.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.667
Just give us his name.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.377
Just one.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.963
You can do it.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.965
Give us his name.

17:29.007 --> 17:32.427
* *

17:32.469 --> 17:36.014
- Baltasar.
- Thank you.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.308
[patting pockets]
Where's my phone?

17:38.350 --> 17:39.601
- What, you don't--
- Do you have my phone?

17:39.642 --> 17:41.353
- No, I don't have it.
- Shoot, my bag.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.313
Where's my bag?
- I think you left it outside.

17:43.355 --> 17:46.441
- I left it out there.
Thank you.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.985
I don't know.
I put it here.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.153
We need to find Baltasar.

17:50.195 --> 17:52.489
- Is Caesar taking
good care of you?

17:52.530 --> 17:54.991
- She would like to buy
La Reina de la Que Va.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.826
- Yeah, I wanna get it.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.412
- The La Reina de la Que Va?
- Yeah, how much is it?

17:59.454 --> 18:01.956
- That's 450,000 pesos.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.542
- Oh, 450,000 pesos.
So that--then, what is that?

18:04.584 --> 18:08.046
- That's 22,000 U.S. dollars.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.674
- American?
- Wow.

18:10.715 --> 18:14.010
- We don't have it.
- Wow, um--

18:14.052 --> 18:16.304
- I know.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.391
So what exactly
are you doing here?

18:19.432 --> 18:22.352
* *

18:22.394 --> 18:24.896
- Can I have my bag, please?

18:27.065 --> 18:28.441
Thank you.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.903
[whispers] Give him the thing.
- Yeah, this is--yeah.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.363
Yeah, thanks.
- [whispers] Pleasure.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.573
- [whispering] Oh, my God.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.033
Keep walking, keep walking,

18:37.075 --> 18:39.369
keep walking,
keep walking, keep walking.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.246
I think we just fucked
with the yellow snake.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.330
- Fuck. What the fuck?

18:42.372 --> 18:43.331
- What was that?
- What the fuck?

18:43.373 --> 18:44.541
- What the fuck?
- What the--

18:44.582 --> 18:45.500
Look at--that guy just
took our picture.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.626
- Which guy?
- That guy.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.378
- [gasps]

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
He's following us.
He's following us.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.839
- Let's run.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.382
- I think I'm too drunk
for this. Oh, my God.

18:52.424 --> 18:55.468
No, no, no, no.
Go, go, go, go.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.762
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Go, go, go, out.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.098
[panting]

19:00.140 --> 19:01.599
Oh, my God. Go, go run!

19:01.641 --> 19:04.227
Ow, ow, ow, my leg, my leg.
- Are you okay?

19:04.269 --> 19:05.562
Go, go, go!
- Okay!

19:05.603 --> 19:07.105
- Okay, he's still behind us.

19:07.147 --> 19:10.025
[breathing heavily]

19:10.066 --> 19:11.568
- Ooh!
- Oh, sorry!

19:11.609 --> 19:12.861
- There he is!
He's really fast!

19:12.902 --> 19:14.279
- Oh, damn it. Hold it!
- Ahh!

19:14.320 --> 19:15.530
No, no, stay, stay!
- Ah--hey!

19:15.572 --> 19:16.740
- Sorry!
- Oh, Lord Jesus!

19:16.781 --> 19:18.867
- We're not gonna
win this one.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.244
- Oh, no!
- We gotta hide! Noah!

19:21.286 --> 19:28.460
* *

19:32.130 --> 19:33.340
Sorry. Thank you.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.551
Gracias, muchas gracias.
- Mm-hmm.

19:36.593 --> 19:39.304
Hola.
[panting]

19:40.764 --> 19:43.266
[gasps]
[exhales deeply]

19:43.308 --> 19:45.894
Estoy caliente.

19:45.935 --> 19:51.649
* *

19:51.691 --> 19:54.611
[whispers] What the fuck
does this guy want?

19:54.652 --> 19:56.404
- Oh, yeah, let me just--

19:56.446 --> 19:58.406
* *

19:58.448 --> 19:59.699
Oh, shit.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.328
Oh, my God.
[line trilling]

20:03.370 --> 20:04.954
Pick up your phone.
Pick up your phone.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.164
Pick up your phone.
[phone buzzing]

20:06.206 --> 20:08.875
- Thank you--sorry, sorry.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.919
Hey, Emma.
Hey, where are you?

20:10.960 --> 20:13.546
- Don't look for me.
Don't look for me. Shit!

20:13.588 --> 20:16.341
- Emma? Emma?
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.884
- What?
- Get back in the shop.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.136
- Where are you?

20:20.178 --> 20:22.138
I don't see you.
- God damn it.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.723
Ah--
- Oh, hey!

20:23.765 --> 20:26.101
- Go, run!
- Oh, oh, okay.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.477
- No!
- [grunts]

20:27.519 --> 20:29.688
- [laughs]
- Oh!

20:29.729 --> 20:30.730
- Whoo!

20:30.772 --> 20:32.607
- What the hell
is even happening?

20:32.649 --> 20:34.609
- I feel alive!

20:34.651 --> 20:35.985
- What?
- [screams]

20:40.657 --> 20:43.034
- Okay, I did not--
I did not like that at all,

20:43.076 --> 20:46.705
not even a little bit, or maybe
I did--who the fuck is that?

20:46.746 --> 20:47.997
- I gotta show you something.
- I should not have had

20:48.039 --> 20:49.165
all that tequila!
- I wanna show you something.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.583
- Are we in real danger?

20:50.625 --> 20:52.085
Because I don't wanna--
I don't wanna, like, be

20:52.127 --> 20:54.129
in real danger at all.
- Come here--I've been doing--

20:54.170 --> 20:56.423
I've been doing some research.
- All right, all right.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.049
- I gotta--
I can't move with it.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.384
- I got it,
I got it, I got it.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.553
- Okay,
and we just gotta figure out

21:01.594 --> 21:05.098
which one of these guys
is Baltasar Frias.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.851
This guy in the suit, right?
He's gotta know something.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.519
- Hey, um, wait, does this--

21:09.561 --> 21:11.021
does this person
look familiar to you?

21:11.062 --> 21:13.189
Right here.

21:13.231 --> 21:15.316
- [gasps]
- Yeah.

21:15.358 --> 21:17.569
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.738
- No way.
- Yeah, I think it is--

21:19.779 --> 21:21.239
- We're following
our instincts.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.575
That's a crack in the case!
- Well, okay--oh.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.035
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.162
Let's go fucking get her.
- We're gonna talk, I mean--

21:27.203 --> 21:29.122
- Yeah! [laughs]
Let's go.

21:29.164 --> 21:32.167
- [speaking Spanish]
Okay, gracias.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.129
Mr. and Mrs. Reed!
So good to see you again.

21:36.171 --> 21:39.341
So how do you like the--
- Is that you?

21:39.382 --> 21:41.051
- [laughs]
Sorry?

21:41.092 --> 21:42.510
- That's you, right?

21:45.430 --> 21:47.349
- No, I don't think so.
Okay, no.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.517
No, no.
[speaks Spanish]

21:49.559 --> 21:52.020
- That is totally you, right?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.190
- Oh, yes.
That's Oceana Vista, yes.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.109
Yes, I have worked
in so many resorts.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.778
- Well, Emma found
this phone in the jungle

21:59.819 --> 22:00.904
that belongs
to this missing kid.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.906
- No.
- And we were just--what?

22:02.947 --> 22:06.743
- Is this--
is this Baltasar Frias?

22:08.995 --> 22:09.913
Right there.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.582
[suspenseful music]

22:12.624 --> 22:14.542
- I don't know.

22:14.584 --> 22:15.835
- I think you do,
because I think

22:15.877 --> 22:17.504
that you're standing
next to him.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.130
So I think you do know
that it's him,

22:19.172 --> 22:21.591
and you continue to know.

22:21.633 --> 22:26.054
* *

22:26.096 --> 22:29.349
- Yes.
He worked in security.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.684
Hello?
- Security?

22:30.725 --> 22:32.227
You don't say.
- I must take this.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.813
Yeah, yes.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.649
- Is someone really calling?
- What the hell?

22:37.691 --> 22:39.859
- Okay, where's that
detective's boat?

22:39.901 --> 22:42.278
Now we're cooking with gas.

22:44.447 --> 22:48.368
- You are not the first to ask
me about that case.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.662
- Yeah, but I bet you that
we are the first people

22:50.704 --> 22:53.498
to have actually
found something, right?

22:53.540 --> 22:56.710
- It's better to eat the past.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.504
- Eat the--
eat the past?

22:59.546 --> 23:03.008
- Does the name Baltasar Frias
mean anything to you?

23:09.472 --> 23:10.598
- Not here.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.063
Come aboard.

23:17.105 --> 23:21.568
- Hey, salud!
[laughter]

23:21.609 --> 23:23.445
- Mmm.

23:23.486 --> 23:25.697
- All right!
- [speaking Spanish]

23:25.739 --> 23:27.449
- I don't know though.
I think you should--

23:27.490 --> 23:28.408
- [laughs]
- You think you can

23:28.450 --> 23:32.328
keep the fuck up?
[laughter]

23:38.460 --> 23:40.920
- Be careful.

23:40.962 --> 23:43.048
She will get herself killed.

23:43.089 --> 23:47.177
Or maybe you.
[laughter]

23:49.429 --> 23:50.388
Bien.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.307
[laughter]

23:52.349 --> 23:54.351
Stay right here.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.855
- Weird energy there.
- Yeah, no.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.648
To me,
this seems totally normal.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.150
Do you wanna leave?
- No.

24:02.192 --> 24:04.194
He knows something, and
I know that he knows something,

24:04.235 --> 24:05.570
and I wanna know what he knows,
you know?

24:05.612 --> 24:06.863
- All right,
just don't challenge him

24:06.905 --> 24:09.741
to a drinking contest.
It--I'm--I'm spinning.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.242
- Were you actually
drinking this?

24:11.284 --> 24:12.952
Noah, you can't be drinking.
- You aren't?

24:12.994 --> 24:15.538
- No, I'm doing a swish
and spit--I'm goin'--

24:15.580 --> 24:16.873
- Oh, no.
- You can't drink this.

24:16.915 --> 24:17.874
You don't know what it is.
- Oh, no.

24:17.916 --> 24:18.958
- It's okay.
Okay, it's okay.

24:19.000 --> 24:19.918
It's okay.
It's okay.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.002
I got it.
I got it.

24:21.044 --> 24:22.504
I got it.
- All right, well, look.

24:22.545 --> 24:25.298
Just in case he's on his way
back up here to kill us--

24:25.340 --> 24:26.716
happy anniversary.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.760
- What?
- [whispers] Happy Anniversary!

24:28.802 --> 24:32.472
- No.
[gasps]

24:32.514 --> 24:34.182
It's the 23rd.
Oh, my God.

24:34.224 --> 24:35.934
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.435
I am so sorry.
- No, it's fine.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.895
It's fine.
- Noah,

24:38.937 --> 24:41.481
why didn't you say anything?
- Well, I was gonna say

24:41.523 --> 24:42.941
something earlier
while you were in the shower,

24:42.982 --> 24:44.734
but you seemed distracted,
and then there was all--

24:44.776 --> 24:46.111
and with the phone.
- I'm so sorry.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.570
- Then we got caught up
in the mystery--

24:47.612 --> 24:49.489
- I can't believe I did that.
- And I just didn't wanna

24:49.531 --> 24:50.949
make you feel under pressure
to do anything.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.992
- You gotta tell me that.
You can't bottle it up.

24:53.034 --> 24:55.161
- It's fine.
* Everything is fine *

24:55.203 --> 24:57.247
- [sighs]

24:57.288 --> 25:01.876
We found the boy's skateboard
in Baltasar's bedroom.

25:01.918 --> 25:04.921
- Holy shit.
- He was our prime suspect.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.381
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.970
I interviewed Baltasar Frias.

25:12.012 --> 25:14.431
He was a hunted man and a liar.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.977
- Peniche?
- He change his name.

25:19.019 --> 25:22.814
- Well.
- I know it was him.

25:22.856 --> 25:25.984
But the storm
washed everything away

25:26.026 --> 25:28.737
before I got any evidence.
- Mm.

25:28.778 --> 25:30.905
- I did not give up.

25:30.947 --> 25:36.870
But the big, big fish
eat the little fish.

25:36.911 --> 25:39.998
The Frias are the big fish.
- Where is he now?

25:40.040 --> 25:41.958
- Some say he's dead.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.086
Some say
he changed his identity

25:45.128 --> 25:47.255
and lives in Buenos Aires.

25:47.297 --> 25:49.758
I believe
he's out there somewhere.

25:51.176 --> 25:52.552
Wait a sec.
Does that say

25:52.594 --> 25:54.804
what I think it says?
Is that--

25:54.846 --> 25:56.848
- His room number.
- He was staying there

25:56.890 --> 25:59.059
when all this went down?
- He lived there.

25:59.100 --> 26:02.270
His room was painted yellow
like Izamal--

26:02.312 --> 26:04.439
the Frias' homeland.
- Oh, my God.

26:04.481 --> 26:07.359
- Yellow.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.945
Um...is that his room?

26:13.448 --> 26:14.866
- Maybe.
- The time stamp here is 5:30

26:14.908 --> 26:16.201
in the morning, right?

26:16.242 --> 26:17.577
He doesn't have a shirt on.
I don't think

26:17.619 --> 26:18.995
they're gonna fuck in either
of their parents' rooms.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.205
So what if they were
in his room?

26:20.246 --> 26:21.956
What if--what if--
what if--what if--what if

26:21.998 --> 26:26.336
um, Sam and Violet
went to go get Sam's skateboard

26:26.378 --> 26:27.962
from Baltasar's room,

26:28.004 --> 26:30.382
and then he caught them there,
and he killed them on the spot?

26:30.423 --> 26:31.341
- [chuckles]

26:31.383 --> 26:32.676
- Okay,
so we just have to match

26:32.717 --> 26:36.846
this photo to his room,
which is yellow, right?

26:36.888 --> 26:39.057
- [chuckles]

26:39.099 --> 26:40.892
You should let me
keep the phone.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.977
- No.
- For your own good.

26:43.019 --> 26:45.271
* *

26:45.313 --> 26:47.941
[sighs]
Do you like your life?

26:47.982 --> 26:49.401
- What kind of
question is that?

26:49.442 --> 26:52.821
- I like my life--
the fish, the boat.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.864
[chuckles]

26:54.906 --> 26:56.950
But this is not what I wanted.

26:58.410 --> 27:03.915
Trust me, this thing is
gonna fuck with your head.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.750
You're on vacation.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.961
I suggest you stay on it.

27:08.003 --> 27:13.425
* *

27:18.680 --> 27:21.641
[indistinct chatter]

27:21.683 --> 27:24.602
[light acoustic music playing]

27:24.644 --> 27:26.479
* *

27:26.521 --> 27:29.065
- You would've been proud
of me--I skipped the dolphins.

27:30.358 --> 27:32.777
I went horseback riding
on the beach,

27:32.819 --> 27:37.323
but they were out of horses,
so I got a mule named Esdel.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.784
I thought they said "Estelle."
I thought it was a her,

27:39.826 --> 27:42.871
but I guess it was a he.

27:42.912 --> 27:45.331
- What?
- You're on your phone.

27:45.373 --> 27:50.253
- Anyway, and I went
for a ride in a spaceship.

27:54.090 --> 27:56.968
[clears throat]
Who's the lucky guy?

27:57.010 --> 27:58.595
- No one.

27:58.636 --> 28:00.680
- You know, I told you
I got you something, too.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.975
* *

28:04.017 --> 28:05.852
Merry Christmas, kiddo.

28:05.894 --> 28:09.397
* *

28:09.439 --> 28:11.274
