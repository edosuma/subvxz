WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:04.671
(thunder rumbling)

00:16.282 --> 00:19.119
I didn't know
who else to call.

00:19.152 --> 00:20.220
I think--

00:20.253 --> 00:21.487
I think
I'm in trouble!

00:21.522 --> 00:22.656
Okay, settle down.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.559
BRENDA: I didn't know
who else to call.

00:25.592 --> 00:26.593
I had wine,

00:26.627 --> 00:27.894
and it was raining and--
What happened?

00:27.928 --> 00:30.864
I just hit the accelerator!

00:30.897 --> 00:31.798
All right,
all right.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.700
Sit down.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.603
Slow down.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.539
And just tell me
what happened,

00:38.572 --> 00:40.340
and start from the beginning.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.342
I was driving home
from work.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.644
It was raining.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.079
And I usually park

00:46.112 --> 00:46.780
in my driveway,
you know,

00:46.813 --> 00:48.414
but since it was raining, I--

00:48.448 --> 00:50.216
Slow.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.619
(music playing)

00:58.224 --> 00:59.059
(sighs)

00:59.092 --> 01:00.233
Come on, damn it.

01:05.572 --> 01:07.273
Hey! Get out of the car!
Ah!

01:07.307 --> 01:08.208
Get--

01:08.241 --> 01:08.908
(screams)

01:15.516 --> 01:16.783
You hit him?

01:16.817 --> 01:17.450
BRENDA: Yes.

01:17.483 --> 01:19.419
It was a reflex.

01:19.452 --> 01:20.921
I saw the gun,
and then I just hit

01:20.954 --> 01:21.655
the accelerator.

01:21.688 --> 01:22.823
Where is he now?

01:22.856 --> 01:24.558
In the garage.

01:25.759 --> 01:26.459
He's dead.

01:27.794 --> 01:29.863
Did you call the police?
No.

01:29.896 --> 01:30.864
What?

01:30.897 --> 01:31.998
I just called you.

01:32.999 --> 01:35.368
I first thought,
"Get him to a hospital."

01:35.401 --> 01:37.303
So I was trying
to get him into the car,

01:37.337 --> 01:39.439
but I could see
that he was already dead.

01:41.274 --> 01:43.043
What am I going to do?

01:43.076 --> 01:44.878
Why haven't you called
the police?

01:45.612 --> 01:47.280
I had some wine

01:47.313 --> 01:49.750
before I left work,

01:49.783 --> 01:51.251
not a lot, but--

01:51.284 --> 01:52.819
Are you sure he's dead?

01:52.853 --> 01:54.087
Pretty sure.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.221
Pretty sure?

01:55.255 --> 01:56.089
Where's the gun?

01:56.122 --> 01:58.424
The garage, I guess.

01:58.458 --> 02:00.333
This is way too much
guessing, Brenda.

02:08.274 --> 02:11.211
(thunder rumbling)

02:25.992 --> 02:26.793
Jimmy?

02:29.596 --> 02:30.731
Is he dead?

02:36.169 --> 02:38.104
He's dead.

02:39.139 --> 02:42.075
(music playing)

03:29.563 --> 03:30.564
MAN: Here you go.

03:33.233 --> 03:34.835
How'd he get in the car?

03:34.868 --> 03:37.270
Her first instinct
was to get him to a hospital.

03:37.303 --> 03:39.172
Then she realized he was dead

03:39.205 --> 03:40.173
and called the police.

03:40.206 --> 03:42.876
After she called you.
Sorry?

03:42.909 --> 03:44.444
GAMBLE: Well, you were here
before the police,

03:44.477 --> 03:46.780
so I'm assuming
she called you first.

03:46.813 --> 03:48.348
BERLUTI:
Yeah, she panicked

03:48.381 --> 03:49.415
and called me.

03:54.721 --> 03:55.822
They'll be taking
the body out

03:55.856 --> 03:57.123
in a few minutes.

03:57.157 --> 03:59.025
Then they'll come in
to look around.

04:00.501 --> 04:01.467
(sighs)

04:01.502 --> 04:05.105
Brenda, you okay?

04:05.138 --> 04:07.808
Is there any chance
you could stay here tonight?

04:07.841 --> 04:09.342
I am so freaked.

04:15.782 --> 04:16.716
I need this to be

04:16.750 --> 04:18.218
in complete confidence, okay?

04:18.250 --> 04:20.654
Not that you,
uh--God!

04:21.454 --> 04:23.123
Take it easy.

04:24.157 --> 04:24.858
Okay.

04:24.891 --> 04:27.360
Um, how do I even start?

04:29.495 --> 04:32.699
Margie and I have been
having some problems at home.

04:32.733 --> 04:33.867
Since when?

04:33.900 --> 04:36.369
Some of it is,
uh, sexual.

04:37.436 --> 04:38.705
Well, more specifically,

04:38.738 --> 04:42.576
uh, I've been having
a few performance issues.

04:42.609 --> 04:45.478
I don't know if it's related
to work or stress or--

04:46.680 --> 04:49.616
Anyway, I read this
ridiculous article.

04:49.650 --> 04:51.184
I put no stock in it,

04:51.217 --> 04:52.786
but I read that men--

04:52.819 --> 04:53.620
not transvestites,

04:53.654 --> 04:55.355
but regular,

04:55.388 --> 04:57.190
heterosexual men,

04:57.223 --> 05:00.634
can sometimes find stimulation

05:00.667 --> 05:02.002
in wearing women's clothes.

05:05.939 --> 05:06.973
My secretary, Paula,

05:07.007 --> 05:08.174
she works out after work

05:08.208 --> 05:09.843
and changes at the office,

05:09.876 --> 05:12.513
leaving her clothes.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.214
Well, last night,

05:14.247 --> 05:16.282
I worked late.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.084
Paula left her bra folded

05:18.118 --> 05:19.786
underneath her jeans,

05:19.820 --> 05:21.087
and I, uh,

05:22.889 --> 05:23.790
I put it on.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.660
You what?

05:26.693 --> 05:27.894
I don't know
what came over me.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.730
I just wanted
to see if it all--

05:32.232 --> 05:33.466
and then I put
my shirt back on

05:33.499 --> 05:35.468
over it since, you know,
I didn't wanna be seen.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.103
God forbid someone
on the crew.

05:39.205 --> 05:41.141
And I got back
into my work,

05:41.174 --> 05:43.209
which, you know
how enmeshed I get in it.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.048
I forgot about it.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.552
You forgot about it?

05:51.585 --> 05:52.686
HENRY: I went home.

05:52.719 --> 05:53.887
I took off my shirt
in the bedroom,

05:53.920 --> 05:56.557
and Margie sees me
wearing a bra.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.691
She flipped.

05:59.225 --> 06:01.502
She thinks I'm having some
kinky thing with Paula.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.669
She calls Paula,

06:02.703 --> 06:05.138
tells her I'm wearing her bra.

06:05.171 --> 06:06.840
Now, my wife wants
to leave me.

06:06.873 --> 06:09.042
Paula's suing me
for sexual harassment.

06:13.647 --> 06:14.414
(sighs)

06:15.248 --> 06:16.983
So basically,
she waited

06:17.017 --> 06:18.484
until her blood alcohol dropped.

06:18.519 --> 06:19.485
I think so.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.587
DONNELL: Jimmy,
is there any chance

06:20.621 --> 06:21.722
this man could have died

06:21.755 --> 06:23.624
while she was waiting for--
BERLUTI: No.

06:23.657 --> 06:25.191
I know this woman, Bobby.

06:25.225 --> 06:26.192
She would never.

06:26.226 --> 06:27.828
What do we know
about the dead guy?

06:27.861 --> 06:29.663
Name's Gerald Hanks,

06:29.696 --> 06:30.631
has a record,

06:30.664 --> 06:31.665
drug history.

06:31.698 --> 06:33.366
And what's your relationship
with her?

06:33.399 --> 06:34.234
Sorry?

06:34.267 --> 06:35.602
Brenda Miller,

06:35.636 --> 06:37.137
what's your relationship
with her?

06:37.170 --> 06:38.071
Old friend.

06:38.104 --> 06:40.641
I was buddies
with her big brother.

06:40.674 --> 06:43.710
I was kind of like
a surrogate big brother.

06:43.744 --> 06:44.745
(door opens)

06:48.749 --> 06:49.415
Jimmy.

06:50.483 --> 06:51.417
What's the matter?

06:53.887 --> 06:55.288
How soon before the police

06:55.321 --> 06:56.657
did you get there last night?

06:56.690 --> 06:58.625
I don't know.
Not too much sooner.

06:58.659 --> 07:00.466
Why?
You wouldn't be a witness

07:00.501 --> 07:01.702
of any kind, would you?

07:01.735 --> 07:03.369
I'm not a witness
to anything

07:03.403 --> 07:04.938
except what I told you.

07:04.971 --> 07:06.239
What's going on?

07:06.272 --> 07:07.808
The man your client ran over

07:07.841 --> 07:09.342
in her garage,

07:09.375 --> 07:11.077
he had a bullet in his back.

07:11.111 --> 07:12.178
What?

07:13.479 --> 07:15.982
Maybe his gun went off
when she hit him.

07:16.016 --> 07:16.917
GAMBLE:
The bullet didn't match

07:16.950 --> 07:18.284
the gun we found
in the garage.

07:18.318 --> 07:19.485
And Jimmy,

07:21.321 --> 07:23.890
the gun is registered
to your client.

07:27.594 --> 07:28.862
Why me?

07:28.895 --> 07:30.831
YOUNG: Because I suspect
they're going to exploit this

07:30.864 --> 07:32.165
as gender discrimination.

07:32.198 --> 07:34.234
I want a woman lawyer
second chairing to prohibit--

07:34.267 --> 07:36.402
STRINGER: If I'm not gonna
do anything--

07:36.436 --> 07:38.171
Your presence
will be doing something.

07:38.204 --> 07:39.540
That's why I want you there.

07:39.573 --> 07:41.274
Am I allowed to talk?

07:41.307 --> 07:42.676
If you have something
to contribute,

07:42.709 --> 07:43.677
of course.

07:47.981 --> 07:49.750
Could I ask why you're leaving?

07:49.783 --> 07:52.853
What young litigator
wouldn't wanna be at Goodwin?

07:52.886 --> 07:55.522
Well, it wasn't exactly
a great match for me, so...

07:55.556 --> 07:57.023
DOLE: Why?

07:57.057 --> 08:00.634
Well, I was sort of
encouraged to leave.

08:00.667 --> 08:01.968
You were fired?

08:02.002 --> 08:03.504
CLAIRE: I don't like
the word fired,

08:03.537 --> 08:05.739
as accurate as it may be.

08:05.772 --> 08:07.040
They're very pleased
with my work.

08:07.073 --> 08:08.241
You could check
my references.

08:08.274 --> 08:09.309
It wasn't my work.

08:09.342 --> 08:11.712
What was it, then?

08:11.745 --> 08:13.046
I knew it would get to this.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.816
I became ill

08:15.849 --> 08:16.917
on a partner--

08:18.018 --> 08:19.452
Ah.
CLAIRE: In a deposition.

08:19.485 --> 08:20.821
I have a, uh,

08:20.854 --> 08:23.189
vasovagal problem triggered
by anxiety,

08:23.223 --> 08:25.191
manifests on extremely
rare occasion,

08:25.225 --> 08:26.727
but it did so
in projectile form

08:26.760 --> 08:27.961
on a senior partner,

08:27.994 --> 08:28.962
once.

08:30.564 --> 08:32.131
And you were discharged?

08:32.164 --> 08:34.467
They didn't believe I had
the stomach to be a litigator,

08:34.500 --> 08:36.001
since it happened

08:36.035 --> 08:37.470
a few times before,
but they were wrong.

08:37.504 --> 08:38.404
It was all about breathing,

08:38.438 --> 08:39.905
which I have learned to do.

08:41.041 --> 08:43.876
Well, your transcript
is great.

08:46.547 --> 08:48.248
But I am looking
for someone

08:48.281 --> 08:50.116
with a little bit
more experience,

08:50.150 --> 08:52.018
and, uh,

08:52.052 --> 08:53.587
but I'll let you know,

08:53.620 --> 08:54.320
okay?

08:54.354 --> 08:55.989
Sure.

09:00.266 --> 09:02.068
He was shot?
Yes.

09:02.102 --> 09:02.836
BRENDA: By whom?

09:02.869 --> 09:05.305
Well, we don't know.

09:05.338 --> 09:07.841
Did you notice him
bleeding at all or--

09:07.874 --> 09:08.775
It happened so fast.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.210
After I hit him,

09:10.243 --> 09:11.477
I noticed he was bleeding,

09:11.512 --> 09:12.879
but I just thought that--

09:12.913 --> 09:14.347
Brenda,

09:14.380 --> 09:16.983
the gun they found
in the garage,

09:17.017 --> 09:18.519
it was registered to you.

09:21.722 --> 09:23.857
BRENDA:
This is where I keep it.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.059
He must have found it.

09:26.092 --> 09:28.328
BERLUTI:
So somebody shot this man,

09:28.361 --> 09:29.596
he entered your house,

09:29.630 --> 09:31.197
retrieved your gun,

09:31.231 --> 09:33.534
and you ran him over?

09:33.567 --> 09:34.200
Yeah.

09:34.234 --> 09:35.001
Brenda,

09:35.035 --> 09:36.803
everything
you've told me so far,

09:36.837 --> 09:37.771
it's the truth?

09:37.804 --> 09:39.205
BRENDA: Of course,
it's the truth.

09:39.239 --> 09:40.741
Jimmy, what's going on?
BERLUTI: I don't know,

09:40.774 --> 09:42.408
but this isn't making sense.

09:42.442 --> 09:44.511
The police
wanna talk to you.

09:44.545 --> 09:46.246
I'm inclined to let you talk

09:46.279 --> 09:49.082
if everything you said
is the truth.

09:49.115 --> 09:50.483
If it isn't,

09:50.517 --> 09:51.985
that's something different.

09:56.489 --> 09:57.724
What?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.368
Brenda,

10:02.402 --> 10:04.170
come clean with me.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.939
Tell me what really happened.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.443
I hit him in the street

10:10.476 --> 10:12.045
somewhere near my work.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.148
It was pouring rain,

10:15.181 --> 10:16.482
and I could barely see,

10:16.517 --> 10:18.451
and suddenly he was just

10:18.484 --> 10:19.753
in front of my car.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.722
I could barely hit my brake.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.026
I didn't have my cell phone.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.463
There was nothing around.

10:30.496 --> 10:33.166
I was in the middle of nowhere,

10:33.199 --> 10:36.036
and I tried to get him
in my car,

10:36.069 --> 10:38.138
figuring I could get him
to a hospital.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.175
But then I could see
that he was already dead,

10:42.208 --> 10:45.378
and I'd been drinking,

10:45.411 --> 10:47.013
and I panicked.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.649
So you brought him home?

10:48.682 --> 10:50.216
I figured I could.
I don't know.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.386
Jimmy, I was half-drunk
and scared,

10:53.419 --> 10:55.421
and things did not make sense.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.791
So I came into my room,

10:57.824 --> 10:58.925
and I got my gun,
and I put it

10:58.959 --> 11:00.801
in the garage

11:00.834 --> 11:01.968
so I'd be able to say

11:02.002 --> 11:04.705
that there was a man
with a gun.

11:04.738 --> 11:06.472
It was the only thing
I could think of,

11:06.507 --> 11:08.174
and then I called you.

11:09.275 --> 11:12.078
He must have been shot

11:12.112 --> 11:14.180
and maybe he was running

11:14.214 --> 11:15.315
from somebody when he ran

11:15.348 --> 11:16.550
in front of my car.

11:18.619 --> 11:19.520
I don't know.

11:20.687 --> 11:21.688
I don't know.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.237
(dog barking)

11:53.820 --> 11:56.757
(music playing)

12:25.191 --> 12:26.092
What time is it?

12:27.594 --> 12:28.394
(sighs)

12:30.797 --> 12:32.032
7:00.

12:35.836 --> 12:37.170
I better get ready
for work.

12:38.238 --> 12:39.172
Okay.

12:43.409 --> 12:46.446
Basically, it's the same
scenario as before,

12:46.479 --> 12:48.048
except she hit him
in the street

12:48.081 --> 12:49.916
instead of her garage.

12:49.950 --> 12:50.917
My question is,

12:50.951 --> 12:52.853
do I let her say this
to the police?

12:52.886 --> 12:54.320
You do if you're nuts.

12:54.354 --> 12:57.190
Sometimes the cover-up
can be worse than the crime.

12:57.223 --> 12:58.825
DONNELL: She's already committed
the cover-up, Jimmy.

12:58.859 --> 13:00.200
If this new version gets out,

13:00.233 --> 13:02.135
she'll be charged
with vehicular manslaughter,

13:02.168 --> 13:03.670
no question.
Well, I disagree.

13:03.704 --> 13:05.038
I think there is a question.

13:05.071 --> 13:06.172
If this guy was shot

13:06.206 --> 13:08.041
and chased in front of her car,

13:08.074 --> 13:09.843
then it is not vehicular
manslaughter.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.145
The prospect of the police
believing that--

13:12.178 --> 13:13.614
WASHINGTON: Look, forensics
is gonna figure out

13:13.647 --> 13:15.415
what happened, anyway.
FRUTT: But there's no reason

13:15.448 --> 13:16.750
to help them.
Come on.

13:16.783 --> 13:19.219
If this woman hit
and killed a man,

13:19.252 --> 13:21.588
and then drove him back
to her garage,

13:21.622 --> 13:22.923
she's gonna be prosecuted,

13:22.956 --> 13:24.558
especially
if she was drinking.

13:24.591 --> 13:25.759
DONNELL: I agree.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.861
There's no way you let her
talk to the police.

13:32.198 --> 13:35.035
This is an extremely
regrettable event,

13:35.068 --> 13:37.270
and I assure you,
we fully appreciate

13:37.303 --> 13:39.372
the sensitivity
of the situation.

13:39.405 --> 13:41.174
YOUNG: Yes.
Was it in the spirit

13:41.207 --> 13:43.009
of this sensitivity
that you sued him?

13:43.043 --> 13:44.210
WRIGHT: Well,
it's in that spirit

13:44.244 --> 13:46.246
that we've refrained
from filing the claim

13:46.279 --> 13:48.749
in the hopes that we can work
this out amicably.

13:48.782 --> 13:49.916
Paula is, of course,

13:49.950 --> 13:52.085
devastated that her employer

13:52.118 --> 13:54.788
would endeavor
to wear her undergarments.

13:54.821 --> 13:57.090
Obviously, a trust
has been shattered.

13:58.324 --> 13:59.926
YOUNG: I suspect, Mr. Wright,

13:59.960 --> 14:01.635
you have a number?

14:01.668 --> 14:03.837
We do.

14:03.870 --> 14:05.972
Might you tell me the number?

14:06.006 --> 14:06.940
Uh-hmm.

14:20.754 --> 14:23.023
$500,000?

14:23.056 --> 14:24.490
It's very difficult,
of course,

14:24.525 --> 14:26.527
to quantify emotional pain.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.928
But you've managed.

14:27.961 --> 14:29.295
WRIGHT: Injuries,
like products,

14:29.329 --> 14:30.163
find their market value.

14:30.196 --> 14:31.798
For this particular
infraction--

14:31.832 --> 14:33.333
HENRY: $500,000?

14:33.366 --> 14:35.001
WRIGHT: A jury could
easily award more

14:35.035 --> 14:36.269
with unwanted exposure,

14:36.302 --> 14:37.671
by the way.

14:37.704 --> 14:39.405
I'm sure your attorney
would agree our number

14:39.439 --> 14:40.874
does not shock the conscience.

14:40.907 --> 14:42.976
Do you have a conscience, Paula?
YOUNG: Henry.

14:43.009 --> 14:45.979
WRIGHT: My client is always
open to morality sermons

14:46.012 --> 14:47.147
if he wants to give one.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.983
If we were to agree
to this number,

14:50.016 --> 14:51.818
we assume it would embrace

14:51.852 --> 14:53.720
a complete
confidentiality agreement.

14:53.754 --> 14:54.721
WRIGHT: Absolutely.

14:54.755 --> 14:56.122
As I've said
from the onset,

14:56.156 --> 14:58.659
we fully understand
the sensitivity

14:58.692 --> 15:00.534
of the situation.
YOUNG: Yes.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.970
You're sweet.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.005
We'll give you to the end

15:05.038 --> 15:06.106
of business tomorrow.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.383
You said you'd call.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.019
I did?

15:19.052 --> 15:20.787
Well, you said
you'd let me know,

15:20.821 --> 15:23.524
and since no news
is so often good news,

15:23.557 --> 15:26.259
I guess I was hoping
it would apply here.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.293
Oh.

15:30.664 --> 15:31.998
It wouldn't.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.234
I didn't get the job?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.402
No.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.772
Would you mind
telling me who did?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.208
I haven't hired yet.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.311
Oh, well,
so it could be anybody,

15:45.345 --> 15:46.346
just not me.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.887
Well, thank you
for considering me.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.024
Bye.

15:58.058 --> 15:58.992
DOLE: Bye.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.135
(door closes)

16:03.837 --> 16:06.339
So she's not gonna
talk to us?

16:06.372 --> 16:07.708
BERLUTI: Well, I decided

16:07.741 --> 16:09.442
to be the overprotective
attorney.

16:09.475 --> 16:10.376
Come on, Helen.

16:10.410 --> 16:12.012
What lawyer lets
his client talk,

16:12.045 --> 16:13.079
innocent or not?

16:13.113 --> 16:15.215
And yours is innocent?
Yes.

16:15.248 --> 16:16.817
Could you tell us
why she had a gun?

16:16.850 --> 16:18.084
Personal protection.

16:18.118 --> 16:19.986
She lives alone,
wants to be safe.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.121
WALSH: See,
there's a couple of things

16:21.154 --> 16:22.322
that confuse us, Jimmy.

16:22.355 --> 16:23.957
Like, if he'd been shot,

16:23.990 --> 16:25.125
he'd be bleeding.

16:25.158 --> 16:26.660
He was supposedly
inside her house,

16:26.693 --> 16:28.595
yet we found no blood
in her house

16:28.629 --> 16:31.031
or in the garage
for that matter.

16:31.064 --> 16:33.534
Did she clean it up?
Don't know.

16:33.567 --> 16:35.101
GAMBLE: Jimmy,
it seems the body

16:35.135 --> 16:36.703
was dragged in the direction

16:36.737 --> 16:38.639
from the car to the wall,

16:38.672 --> 16:39.773
back to the car.

16:39.806 --> 16:41.642
Now, what would explain that?

16:41.675 --> 16:43.076
Don't know.

16:43.109 --> 16:44.410
Okay.

16:44.444 --> 16:46.079
Have your client here
within an hour

16:46.112 --> 16:48.148
or we pick her up.
Why?

16:48.181 --> 16:49.415
WALSH: We wanna trace metal her.

16:49.449 --> 16:51.084
See if she's fired
a gun recently.

16:51.117 --> 16:52.719
Bullet didn't match her gun.

16:52.753 --> 16:54.821
GAMBLE: Well, maybe
she has another one.

16:54.855 --> 16:56.757
Maybe she's a really
big believer

16:56.790 --> 16:58.058
in personal protection.

16:58.091 --> 17:00.534
BERLUTI: Look,
my client is innocent.

17:00.567 --> 17:03.369
Why is this attracting
the attention of two DAs?

17:03.403 --> 17:06.106
Because you have
our curiosity piqued.

17:06.138 --> 17:07.574
Jimmy, within an hour.

17:12.512 --> 17:15.115
But I didn't shoot any gun.

17:15.147 --> 17:16.883
BERLUTI: Then a trace
metal is good.

17:16.916 --> 17:19.553
It'll pretty much show that.

17:19.586 --> 17:20.820
You really didn't?

17:20.854 --> 17:22.454
Jimmy, I'm telling you
the truth.

17:22.488 --> 17:23.189
BERLUTI: Great,

17:23.223 --> 17:24.891
then we let them do the test.

17:24.925 --> 17:26.693
It's not a problem.

17:26.727 --> 17:27.492
Okay.

17:37.337 --> 17:38.271
Jimmy,

17:42.543 --> 17:45.879
this morning you were kind of...

17:45.912 --> 17:47.480
caressing my face.

17:47.514 --> 17:49.816
What was--

17:49.850 --> 17:52.352
I was just comforting you

17:52.385 --> 17:54.354
'cause, you know...

17:58.525 --> 17:59.726
How come you never--

18:01.401 --> 18:02.368
never mind.

18:02.402 --> 18:03.670
Never mind what?

18:06.172 --> 18:08.274
I always got the feeling

18:08.308 --> 18:10.243
that you kind of liked me.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.649
How come you never asked me out?

18:17.050 --> 18:19.152
Were you interested
in going out with me?

18:20.654 --> 18:21.421
I don't know.

18:21.454 --> 18:22.723
There you go.

18:22.756 --> 18:24.558
That's why I never asked.

18:24.591 --> 18:26.359
BRENDA: I was interested
for a while,

18:26.392 --> 18:28.061
but then...

18:28.094 --> 18:29.630
I got a little nervous.

18:29.663 --> 18:31.031
Nervous?

18:31.064 --> 18:32.032
About what?

18:34.067 --> 18:35.736
Maybe you were
in love with me.

18:37.170 --> 18:40.707
Brenda, I was 16, 17.

18:40.741 --> 18:42.743
I didn't even know
what love was.

18:43.677 --> 18:44.945
Were you?

18:47.981 --> 18:48.915
Yes.

18:50.584 --> 18:53.587
And do you still
have feelings?

18:54.988 --> 18:56.256
Not that--no.

18:58.759 --> 19:00.466
Then why this morning, why--

19:00.500 --> 19:02.536
BERLUTI: I was just
comforting you.

19:02.569 --> 19:03.937
I said this already.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.708
Okay.

19:10.611 --> 19:12.546
We should get
to the police station.

19:14.147 --> 19:15.248
Okay.

19:29.663 --> 19:30.430
WOMAN: Okay.

19:30.463 --> 19:31.632
Done.

19:31.665 --> 19:32.666
Negative.

19:32.699 --> 19:34.535
Satisfied?

19:34.568 --> 19:36.002
GAMBLE: Jimmy,
it's hardly conclusive.

19:36.036 --> 19:37.437
Just let me talk to her.

19:37.470 --> 19:38.572
She'd love to talk,

19:38.605 --> 19:39.940
but I can't let her, Helen.

19:39.973 --> 19:41.642
No upside and you know it.

19:41.675 --> 19:44.244
We could positively
rule her out.

19:44.277 --> 19:47.447
BERLUTI:
You can rule her out now.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.281
We're done.

19:57.824 --> 19:58.825
(sighs)

19:58.859 --> 20:00.466
So is it really over?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.235
Let's hope so.

20:02.268 --> 20:04.037
They've got no real evidence

20:04.070 --> 20:04.871
that it didn't happen

20:04.905 --> 20:05.839
like you said it did.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.943
Even though what I told them

20:09.976 --> 20:11.745
wasn't exactly the truth?

20:11.778 --> 20:14.948
My legal advice on that, Brenda,

20:14.981 --> 20:17.050
don't tell anybody,

20:17.083 --> 20:18.118
not your family,

20:18.151 --> 20:19.886
your shrink,
your clergy,

20:19.920 --> 20:20.721
your boyfriend.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.025
You got a boyfriend?

20:25.058 --> 20:26.527
No.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.297
(music playing)

20:37.203 --> 20:38.238
Thank you.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.307
No problem.

20:45.045 --> 20:46.713
So you wanna come in?

20:51.952 --> 20:53.119
I'm not that liquid,

20:53.153 --> 20:54.487
believe it or not,

20:54.521 --> 20:56.189
I can sell some property if--

20:57.991 --> 21:00.133
tell me what to do.

21:00.166 --> 21:02.569
I think you should
let me fight this, Henry.

21:04.070 --> 21:06.372
But if this should get out,

21:06.406 --> 21:07.407
my dignity.

21:08.775 --> 21:10.677
What happens to your dignity

21:10.711 --> 21:11.645
if you roll over?

21:15.181 --> 21:16.717
Look,

21:16.750 --> 21:18.685
go home.

21:18.719 --> 21:20.220
Talk to Margie.

21:20.253 --> 21:21.988
Let me deal
with this lawsuit.

21:26.192 --> 21:27.861
My life is over,

21:27.894 --> 21:29.462
isn't it?

21:29.495 --> 21:31.331
Go be with your wife, Henry.

21:38.505 --> 21:39.840
You're gonna fight this?

21:39.873 --> 21:41.608
Eugene, the guy's
a vice president

21:41.642 --> 21:42.843
of a brokerage firm.
Meaning?

21:42.876 --> 21:43.977
Meaning if this gets out,

21:44.010 --> 21:45.579
win or lose,
he loses.

21:45.612 --> 21:48.749
YOUNG: Jamie, sometimes
principle has to matter.

21:48.782 --> 21:50.250
Principle.

21:50.283 --> 21:52.418
May I volunteer
something on principle?

21:52.452 --> 21:53.854
Go right ahead.

21:53.887 --> 21:55.088
STRINGER: On principle,

21:55.121 --> 21:57.490
I object to being
put on a case

21:57.524 --> 21:59.092
as window dressing.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.100
It's demeaning.

22:00.133 --> 22:01.001
Is that right?

22:01.034 --> 22:02.736
STRINGER: Yes,
I'm second chairing

22:02.769 --> 22:03.970
as a token woman,

22:04.004 --> 22:05.371
and I find it offensive.

22:05.405 --> 22:07.908
Well, maybe I put you
on this case to learn,

22:07.941 --> 22:09.976
to get experience.

22:10.010 --> 22:11.377
What am I supposed
to be learning?

22:11.411 --> 22:14.147
The meeting's at 9:00 A. M.

22:14.180 --> 22:15.248
Be on time.

22:23.089 --> 22:25.358
Is this as far
as you'll come in?

22:25.391 --> 22:26.392
BERLUTI: Brenda,

22:26.426 --> 22:28.494
I got to admit,

22:28.529 --> 22:30.363
this is--

22:30.396 --> 22:31.865
this is very strange for me.

22:32.833 --> 22:34.067
Why?

22:34.100 --> 22:35.636
BERLUTI: Look,

22:35.669 --> 22:36.903
the thing is,

22:36.937 --> 22:38.238
being your lawyer,

22:38.271 --> 22:40.173
I got ethical rules to follow,

22:40.206 --> 22:41.274
and...

22:54.555 --> 22:55.889
Was that so hard?

23:03.870 --> 23:05.872
(knocks on door)

23:11.244 --> 23:13.647
Yes, I'm looking for
a Brenda Miller.

23:13.680 --> 23:14.848
Ah!

23:14.881 --> 23:15.949
I see I found her.

23:15.982 --> 23:17.050
Who are you?

23:17.083 --> 23:18.819
HERRICK: I'll get to that.

23:18.852 --> 23:20.186
But first, who's he?

23:22.255 --> 23:23.356
I'm her lawyer.

23:23.389 --> 23:24.324
HERRICK: Oh,

23:24.357 --> 23:26.292
I bet she could definitely use
one of those.

23:27.561 --> 23:29.462
Right, Brenda?

23:29.495 --> 23:32.032
Nasty weather it was
the other night driving,

23:32.065 --> 23:32.866
wasn't it?

23:32.899 --> 23:34.134
Who are you?

23:34.167 --> 23:36.369
HERRICK:
My name is Herrick Smoltz.

23:36.402 --> 23:38.905
Don't let the shabby
appearance deceive you.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.574
Underneath,
I'm a piece of crap.

23:40.607 --> 23:42.308
Of course,

23:42.342 --> 23:45.045
I'd never run somebody over.

23:45.078 --> 23:47.247
I was walking on Temple.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.516
I saw you hit that guy

23:49.550 --> 23:51.084
and then drag him into the car

23:51.117 --> 23:53.086
and drive away.

23:53.119 --> 23:54.154
I followed you.

23:54.187 --> 23:57.323
So for...

23:57.357 --> 23:59.693
$100,000,

23:59.726 --> 24:01.535
I won't tell the police
what I saw.

24:01.568 --> 24:03.203
That's extortion.

24:03.236 --> 24:04.771
HERRICK: Yeah, well,
I'll take my chances,

24:06.873 --> 24:08.074
$100,000.

24:09.910 --> 24:10.911
I'll tell you what,

24:10.944 --> 24:12.445
I'll come back,
I'll make contact

24:12.478 --> 24:13.479
with you tomorrow.

24:13.514 --> 24:15.148
You can say "nay" or "yay,"

24:15.181 --> 24:15.916
okay?

24:17.150 --> 24:19.085
(door opens)

24:20.420 --> 24:23.356
(music playing)

24:27.994 --> 24:28.929
You okay?

24:28.962 --> 24:30.597
I guess.

24:30.631 --> 24:33.266
You just let me do all
the talking, okay?

24:34.034 --> 24:34.901
They're here.

24:34.935 --> 24:38.071
YOUNG: Show them in.

24:38.104 --> 24:38.939
Hello.

24:38.972 --> 24:41.542
I apologize for being
slightly late.

24:41.575 --> 24:43.243
I pride myself
on being punctual.

24:43.276 --> 24:44.410
YOUNG: That's all right.

24:44.444 --> 24:45.512
Would you like some coffee
or water?

24:45.546 --> 24:46.312
HORACE: That's very kind of you,

24:46.346 --> 24:47.781
but I think we're fine.

24:57.423 --> 24:58.491
What's this?

24:58.525 --> 25:00.500
That's the counterclaim
we're prepared to file

25:00.534 --> 25:01.835
in answer to your complaint.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.737
It alleges intentional
infliction

25:03.770 --> 25:04.838
of emotional distress.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.540
It names you personally,
Mr. Wright,

25:06.573 --> 25:08.542
as well as Paula.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.711
There's also a count
for abuse of process.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.582
These claims aren't tenable.

25:15.616 --> 25:17.283
Oh, but they are, Mr. Wright.

25:17.317 --> 25:18.985
You attempted
to extort this man.

25:19.019 --> 25:20.621
You not only recognized

25:20.654 --> 25:21.454
the damage your lawsuit

25:21.487 --> 25:22.956
would do to his career,

25:22.989 --> 25:24.691
you played it
like a trump card.

25:24.725 --> 25:27.260
This woman didn't go
to a counselor or a therapist.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.596
She didn't seek treatment
for emotional upset.

25:29.630 --> 25:31.565
She went to the yellow pages.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.368
Don't take me lightly,
Mr. Young,

25:35.401 --> 25:37.303
simply because I advertise.

25:37.337 --> 25:40.406
I take you as seriously
as I do personally.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.410
You're a dishonorable lawyer.

25:44.444 --> 25:45.245
You reflect poorly

25:45.278 --> 25:46.446
on all attorneys,

25:46.479 --> 25:47.648
poorly on me.

25:47.681 --> 25:48.782
I don't like that.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.917
You're also incompetent.

25:50.951 --> 25:52.018
You counseled your client

25:52.052 --> 25:53.520
to commit an offense

25:53.554 --> 25:54.855
more actionable than the one

25:54.888 --> 25:56.657
committed against her.

25:56.690 --> 25:57.724
HORACE: You can't possibly

25:57.758 --> 25:59.125
be willing to take this
to Court,

25:59.159 --> 26:00.534
to take this public.

26:00.567 --> 26:01.968
The first thing I'll do

26:02.002 --> 26:04.137
is bring a motion to recuse you,

26:04.170 --> 26:05.171
which will be successful,

26:05.205 --> 26:07.373
since you're now a named party.

26:07.407 --> 26:09.610
Imagine, win or lose,

26:09.643 --> 26:11.778
this case will end up
costing you money,

26:11.812 --> 26:12.846
Mr. Wright.

26:12.879 --> 26:13.847
Money.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.982
Can I say it one more time?

26:16.016 --> 26:16.950
Money.

26:18.084 --> 26:19.419
You don't scare me.

26:19.452 --> 26:20.954
Here's your out,

26:20.987 --> 26:21.888
$10,000,

26:21.922 --> 26:22.856
and she gets to keep her job,

26:22.889 --> 26:25.058
working for a different
executive,

26:25.091 --> 26:28.028
all conditioned
on confidentiality.

26:28.061 --> 26:30.564
This is a windfall
for both of you.

26:30.597 --> 26:31.632
The offer is good

26:31.665 --> 26:34.034
till the end of business today.

26:36.703 --> 26:37.671
Now, get out

26:37.704 --> 26:39.239
before I bait a hook with you.

26:48.314 --> 26:49.683
(door opens)

26:50.984 --> 26:52.786
I'm not stalking you, I promise.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.721
(door closes)

26:54.755 --> 26:56.857
CLAIRE: I realize
I'm not getting the job,

26:56.890 --> 26:58.458
but...

26:58.491 --> 27:00.734
could I just work here
for three weeks, no salary?

27:00.767 --> 27:01.968
After which I promise to leave.

27:02.002 --> 27:03.303
I will not ask you
to reconsider,

27:03.336 --> 27:05.506
I just need a place to call home
for three weeks.

27:05.539 --> 27:07.908
Then off I go.

27:07.941 --> 27:09.510
You're befuddled,
totally appropriate.

27:09.543 --> 27:10.611
Here's the thing,

27:10.644 --> 27:12.378
I have one client,

27:12.412 --> 27:13.714
one case my firm let me keep

27:13.747 --> 27:15.549
since they considered it a dog.

27:15.582 --> 27:17.751
I'm suing a town
for sponsoring soccer.

27:17.784 --> 27:19.553
You don't need to tell me
how ridiculous it is,

27:19.586 --> 27:20.420
I've been told.

27:20.453 --> 27:22.623
Just assume for the sake
of argument

27:22.656 --> 27:25.325
that the neurological data
backs me up.

27:25.358 --> 27:26.226
Heading a soccer ball

27:26.259 --> 27:28.695
does damage to young brains.

27:28.729 --> 27:30.997
I'm in Court next week
on summary judgment.

27:31.031 --> 27:33.266
My goal is to survive that,

27:33.299 --> 27:34.701
then try to settle.

27:34.735 --> 27:36.036
And this is where I need you.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.672
You beat a tobacco company.

27:38.705 --> 27:39.906
You even helped an airline

27:39.940 --> 27:41.908
win their "Arab-free fly rule".

27:41.942 --> 27:44.578
You have kind of a rep
as a giant slayer,

27:44.611 --> 27:46.112
and my feeling is

27:46.146 --> 27:48.314
if I'm prosecuting
this claim with you,

27:48.348 --> 27:50.350
then that'll at least give
the defendant some pause

27:50.383 --> 27:51.417
which, trust me,

27:51.451 --> 27:53.119
right now they are not getting.

27:53.153 --> 27:53.887
Three weeks,

27:53.920 --> 27:54.921
no salary,

27:54.955 --> 27:55.889
I'm gone.

27:57.390 --> 27:58.892
(sighs)

28:00.734 --> 28:03.403
Can I help you?
I'm here to see Jimmy.

28:03.436 --> 28:04.638
BERLUTI: Brenda.

28:04.671 --> 28:05.606
In here.

28:12.746 --> 28:14.648
I've decided I just can't
take the risk.

28:14.681 --> 28:16.750
Here's a money order
for $100,000.

28:16.783 --> 28:17.718
Let's make the deal.

28:17.751 --> 28:18.384
Hold on.

28:18.418 --> 28:20.220
I have no real choice.

28:20.253 --> 28:21.321
He saw!

28:21.354 --> 28:23.289
BERLUTI: Brenda, wait a second.

28:23.323 --> 28:24.791
This right here is a crime.

28:24.825 --> 28:26.860
Not as bad
as vehicular homicide.

28:26.893 --> 28:27.928
Everything that happened,

28:27.961 --> 28:30.831
happened in a state
of panic or shock.

28:30.864 --> 28:33.634
A man ran in front
of your car.

28:33.667 --> 28:35.135
You put him in your car

28:35.168 --> 28:36.469
to take him to the hospital.

28:36.503 --> 28:38.872
Then, when you realized
he was dead,

28:38.905 --> 28:40.641
you panicked
and drove him home.

28:40.674 --> 28:42.008
This here,

28:42.042 --> 28:43.209
extortion,

28:43.243 --> 28:44.845
buying silence from a witness,

28:44.878 --> 28:45.912
it's reflective

28:45.946 --> 28:47.180
with more criminal intent.

28:47.213 --> 28:48.749
What if he tells?

28:48.782 --> 28:50.416
BERLUTI: My feeling is he won't.

28:50.450 --> 28:52.218
I checked probation.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.254
The guy's got
two B&amp;E convictions,

28:54.287 --> 28:55.355
a drug history,

28:55.388 --> 28:57.323
and some weapons charges.

28:57.357 --> 28:59.159
It's likely he's the shooter.

28:59.192 --> 29:00.967
He was probably chasing
the victim

29:01.001 --> 29:03.003
when he ran
in front of your car.

29:03.036 --> 29:04.404
I don't think
he's going forward.

29:04.437 --> 29:06.339
But we can't guarantee that!

29:10.343 --> 29:12.012
Look, I don't need the money.

29:14.014 --> 29:16.449
I just can't take a chance.

29:16.482 --> 29:18.084
Please make the deal.

29:21.454 --> 29:22.355
DONNELL: Jimmy,

29:22.388 --> 29:23.690
you can't do that.

29:23.724 --> 29:25.826
It's illegal! It's--
She's insisting.

29:25.859 --> 29:27.861
DONNELL: It doesn't matter.
You can't ethically execute

29:27.894 --> 29:29.429
that kind of transaction.

29:29.462 --> 29:30.897
You could be disbarred.

29:30.931 --> 29:32.198
If she wants to do it
on her own,

29:32.232 --> 29:33.199
I suppose you can't stop her.

29:33.233 --> 29:34.500
BERLUTI: There's no way
I'm letting her deal

29:34.535 --> 29:35.368
with the guy alone.

29:35.401 --> 29:36.937
He's probably the shooter.

29:36.970 --> 29:38.171
DONNELL: Jimmy,
you can't be involved

29:38.204 --> 29:39.940
in buying off
a witness' silence.

29:39.973 --> 29:41.908
She's buying it off.

29:41.942 --> 29:43.043
I'm just there to make sure

29:43.076 --> 29:44.210
she doesn't get hurt.

29:46.079 --> 29:47.480
What's your relationship
with her?

29:47.514 --> 29:48.715
I told you, we're friends.

29:48.749 --> 29:49.650
What kind of friends?

29:49.683 --> 29:50.851
Just friends.

29:50.884 --> 29:51.918
That's it.

29:53.486 --> 29:55.221
Well, you can't do this.

29:55.255 --> 29:56.122
It's illegal.

29:56.156 --> 29:57.490
If it backfires,

29:57.524 --> 29:58.324
she could go to jail,

29:58.358 --> 29:59.359
and you could, too.

29:59.392 --> 30:00.567
Forget about it.

30:00.601 --> 30:03.537
(music playing)

30:06.239 --> 30:07.240
Jimmy,

30:09.843 --> 30:10.811
what's going on?

30:14.648 --> 30:16.517
Do you have feelings
for this woman?

30:18.852 --> 30:20.954
I might love her.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.589
Love her?

30:22.623 --> 30:24.224
You haven't seen her
in 20 years.

30:24.257 --> 30:27.027
It evidently didn't go away.

30:29.229 --> 30:31.765
(sighs)

30:31.798 --> 30:33.133
Look,

30:33.166 --> 30:36.670
you have to think of her
as a client,

30:36.703 --> 30:39.039
and only a client.

30:39.072 --> 30:41.107
I can't do that, Bobby.

30:43.376 --> 30:44.811
Men like me...

30:44.845 --> 30:47.614
don't ever get women like her.

30:47.648 --> 30:49.049
Not in high school,

30:49.082 --> 30:49.883
not now.

30:53.186 --> 30:55.055
Does she have feelings
for you, too?

30:55.088 --> 30:56.456
I don't know.

30:56.489 --> 30:57.390
She might.

31:02.268 --> 31:04.738
I know I'm not
thinking straight,

31:04.771 --> 31:06.707
but she seems more important

31:06.740 --> 31:08.374
than my career right now.

31:08.408 --> 31:11.077
More important than anything.

31:11.111 --> 31:13.547
Okay. The fact that
you're saying that

31:13.580 --> 31:15.181
makes it easier to realize

31:15.215 --> 31:16.683
you're not thinking straight.

31:16.717 --> 31:19.319
So I want you to trust me now,

31:19.352 --> 31:22.422
and rely on my judgment, okay?

31:22.455 --> 31:26.392
You cannot pay off this witness.

31:32.733 --> 31:33.734
Okay?

31:36.870 --> 31:37.871
Okay.

31:51.718 --> 31:54.487
DOLE: You didn't say you'd be
taking over the entire office.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.022
The files just got
delivered here.

31:56.056 --> 31:57.057
I'll have most of them
in storage

31:57.090 --> 31:58.091
by the end of the day.

31:58.759 --> 32:00.333
Claire,

32:00.366 --> 32:02.002
suing a town

32:02.035 --> 32:03.537
for having a soccer program?

32:03.570 --> 32:05.672
I've got the medicals
to back it up.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.440
It's called
"Second Impact Syndrome."

32:07.473 --> 32:10.076
There's also a Norwegian study
documenting that soccer players

32:10.110 --> 32:12.078
have more attention problems.

32:12.112 --> 32:14.581
I think I've got enough
to survive summary judgment,

32:14.615 --> 32:15.782
and if I do that,

32:15.816 --> 32:17.618
I really believe
that I can settle.

32:18.852 --> 32:19.786
Okay.

32:20.921 --> 32:21.855
Thank you.

32:24.791 --> 32:28.294
I'm acting only
as your friend here,

32:28.328 --> 32:29.195
not your lawyer.

32:29.229 --> 32:30.631
Why do you keep saying that?

32:30.664 --> 32:33.934
Because I can't let my firm
incur any liability.

32:33.967 --> 32:35.235
Okay. Look,

32:35.268 --> 32:36.737
if you prefer
I do this myself.

32:36.770 --> 32:37.771
Not a chance.

32:37.804 --> 32:40.173
I'm not letting you be alone
with this guy.

32:45.679 --> 32:47.948
(doorbell dings)

32:47.981 --> 32:49.049
(sighs)

32:49.082 --> 32:50.250
Right on time.

33:00.026 --> 33:01.234
Lovely day, isn't it?

33:02.368 --> 33:03.303
Let's go.

33:09.242 --> 33:10.376
Have a seat, Mr. Smoltz.

33:14.681 --> 33:16.082
I have two things.

33:16.116 --> 33:18.752
A money order in the amount
of $100,000.

33:18.785 --> 33:20.420
This is good.

33:20.453 --> 33:22.288
And here's a confession
you must sign

33:22.322 --> 33:23.724
in order to get that money.

33:23.757 --> 33:25.692
A confession?

33:25.726 --> 33:27.260
BERLUTI:
I'm not stupid, Mr. Smoltz.

33:27.293 --> 33:29.996
Somebody shot Gerald Hanks
in the back.

33:30.030 --> 33:33.299
You just happened
to be there that night.

33:33.333 --> 33:34.835
I'll bet you just happened

33:34.868 --> 33:36.637
to be a former
"business" partner

33:36.670 --> 33:38.905
of Gerald Hanks.

33:38.939 --> 33:40.473
First,

33:40.507 --> 33:42.576
you're out of your mind.

33:42.609 --> 33:43.910
Second,

33:43.944 --> 33:44.945
you're totally out
of your mind

33:44.978 --> 33:46.479
if you think I'm signing this.

33:48.849 --> 33:49.816
Look,

33:50.517 --> 33:51.585
we got no guarantee

33:51.618 --> 33:53.286
you won't be back next week

33:53.319 --> 33:55.021
demanding another hundred grand.

33:55.055 --> 33:57.323
We need to have
something on you.

33:57.357 --> 33:59.292
You sign this confession,

33:59.325 --> 34:01.434
I keep it sealed
in my office safe.

34:02.536 --> 34:03.970
You never bother us again,

34:04.004 --> 34:05.739
it stays there.
If you do--

34:05.772 --> 34:07.040
HERRICK: Suppose there's an
office fire.

34:07.073 --> 34:08.875
Suppose somebody breaks
into that safe.

34:08.909 --> 34:10.342
I'm not signing nothing.

34:10.376 --> 34:12.378
Then you don't get the money!

34:12.411 --> 34:15.681
(music playing)

34:15.716 --> 34:17.518
You don't wanna say that,
Mr. Berluti.

34:18.685 --> 34:20.485
Sign the confession,

34:20.521 --> 34:21.987
you get the money.

34:23.623 --> 34:24.791
What about this?

34:24.824 --> 34:27.060
You give me the money.

34:27.092 --> 34:28.194
You two live.

34:28.228 --> 34:29.896
Police! Freeze! Drop the gun!
OFFICER: Freeze!

34:29.929 --> 34:31.197
OFFICER: Drop, drop,
drop the gun!

34:31.231 --> 34:32.565
Drop!
OFFICER: Down on the ground!

34:32.599 --> 34:34.034
Down on the ground!

34:34.067 --> 34:34.900
Down!

34:34.935 --> 34:35.835
Down!
BRENDA: (screams)

34:37.904 --> 34:41.675
(music playing)

34:41.708 --> 34:42.509
OFFICER: Get him up.

34:42.543 --> 34:43.476
Let's go.

34:44.911 --> 34:46.612
OFFICER: You have the right
to remain silent.

34:46.647 --> 34:47.848
Anything you say can

34:47.880 --> 34:49.650
and will be used against you
in a Court of law.

34:49.683 --> 34:50.784
You have the right
to an attorney.

34:51.417 --> 34:52.619
Okay. Let them go.

34:54.487 --> 34:55.789
What's going on?

34:55.822 --> 34:57.691
GAMBLE: What's going on
is Mr. Berluti

34:57.724 --> 34:59.826
just saved your pretty face.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.301
We've agreed
to give you immunity

35:01.334 --> 35:02.468
for your D.U.I.

35:02.503 --> 35:04.971
and possible vehicular
manslaughter

35:05.005 --> 35:06.940
in exchange for the shooter.

35:06.973 --> 35:08.408
What?

35:08.441 --> 35:10.243
WALSH: You better hope
that gun matches,

35:10.276 --> 35:12.245
because if we can't get him,

35:12.278 --> 35:13.346
we'll be back.

35:25.458 --> 35:27.260
Twenty thousand, all in.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.629
The offer was 10,000,
Mr. Wright.

35:28.662 --> 35:30.697
Ten per cup

35:30.731 --> 35:31.932
and we can all go home.

35:31.965 --> 35:34.701
Fifteen and I get to talk
to your client.

35:34.735 --> 35:36.136
Why?

35:36.169 --> 35:37.303
YOUNG: Because I want to.

35:37.337 --> 35:38.438
Fifteen,

35:38.471 --> 35:39.673
confidential,

35:39.706 --> 35:41.207
and I talk to her now.

35:45.546 --> 35:46.613
Okay.

35:46.647 --> 35:48.414
I don't think it's acceptable

35:48.448 --> 35:49.816
for you to speak to her alone

35:49.850 --> 35:51.251
outside--
YOUNG: She won't be alone.

35:51.284 --> 35:53.620
Ms. Stringer will be here.

35:53.654 --> 35:54.420
HORACE: Why can't I be there?

35:54.454 --> 35:55.856
Because I find you to be

35:55.889 --> 35:57.423
an annoying distraction.

35:59.660 --> 36:00.901
It's okay.

36:03.970 --> 36:04.971
Henry.

36:12.546 --> 36:14.480
(door closes)

36:15.181 --> 36:17.317
Surprisingly,
my client had a lot

36:17.350 --> 36:19.920
of nice things to say
about you, Paula.

36:19.953 --> 36:22.856
My suspicion is you aren't
the least bit upset about this,

36:22.889 --> 36:25.391
probably had a good laugh.

36:25.425 --> 36:26.326
Then you got the idea

36:26.359 --> 36:27.861
that this was a lottery ticket.

36:29.563 --> 36:30.496
Henry Winslow

36:30.531 --> 36:32.498
has been extremely good to you.

36:32.533 --> 36:34.568
He's a good person.

36:34.601 --> 36:36.269
You're 26 years old.

36:36.302 --> 36:37.838
The kind of person you will be

36:37.871 --> 36:39.640
has yet to be determined.

36:39.673 --> 36:41.407
But how you behaved here,

36:41.441 --> 36:43.644
it wasn't in keeping
with being a good person.

36:44.978 --> 36:46.513
Now, you might skip out
of here thinking,

36:46.547 --> 36:48.815
"Wow, I just made $15,000,

36:48.849 --> 36:51.151
and I wasn't even injured."

36:51.184 --> 36:52.953
But Paula,

36:52.986 --> 36:54.688
if this settlement in any way

36:54.721 --> 36:55.822
causes you to think

36:55.856 --> 36:57.991
that what you did here
was acceptable,

37:00.333 --> 37:02.168
then you've been injured indeed.

37:09.008 --> 37:10.043
That's all.

37:30.196 --> 37:31.565
Great.

37:31.598 --> 37:33.033
Thank you.

37:33.066 --> 37:33.967
Thanks.

37:36.770 --> 37:37.838
Ballistics match.

37:37.871 --> 37:40.040
It's officially over.

37:40.073 --> 37:42.909
You got immunity.

37:42.943 --> 37:43.877
Good.

37:46.146 --> 37:47.080
What's wrong?

37:50.116 --> 37:52.352
Jimmy, I know you did
the right thing.

37:52.385 --> 37:54.420
And...

37:54.454 --> 37:55.355
I'm grateful...

37:55.388 --> 37:56.657
for how things worked out,

37:56.690 --> 37:57.924
but...

37:57.958 --> 38:00.200
going behind my back

38:00.233 --> 38:01.301
to the police.

38:01.334 --> 38:03.570
I didn't want you knowing
anything.

38:03.604 --> 38:04.871
I didn't wanna be hanging this

38:04.905 --> 38:07.107
on your poker skills
with that guy.

38:07.140 --> 38:09.175
That's not my point.

38:10.276 --> 38:11.277
What is your point?

38:11.311 --> 38:14.447
You took a big risk
with my life.

38:14.480 --> 38:16.116
What if ballistics
didn't match?

38:16.149 --> 38:17.951
I could be going to jail
right now.

38:17.984 --> 38:21.354
Look, making deals with guys
like Herrick Smoltz

38:21.387 --> 38:23.189
never turns out good.

38:23.223 --> 38:25.425
Once you go down that path--
BRENDA: Again,

38:25.458 --> 38:27.961
not the point.

38:27.994 --> 38:29.730
You went behind my back.

38:31.031 --> 38:33.166
It was dishonest.

38:33.199 --> 38:36.136
(music playing)

38:37.337 --> 38:40.240
Dishonest?

38:40.273 --> 38:42.042
I don't think I'm wearing

38:42.075 --> 38:44.611
the dishonesty badge
here, Brenda.

38:44.645 --> 38:46.179
You lied to the police,

38:46.212 --> 38:49.816
which I think
can be explained by panic.

38:49.850 --> 38:52.919
But as I said,
this here, this deal,

38:52.953 --> 38:54.454
it was criminal.

38:54.487 --> 38:56.056
It was fraud.

38:56.089 --> 38:58.692
And it put my character
into play.

38:58.725 --> 39:00.701
And let me tell you something,

39:00.734 --> 39:04.104
if my character
doesn't matter to you,

39:04.137 --> 39:05.939
then I don't matter to you.

39:09.009 --> 39:10.276
Fine.

39:10.310 --> 39:11.545
What "fine"? What?

39:11.578 --> 39:12.212
BRENDA: Like I said, I know

39:12.245 --> 39:14.080
you did the right thing.

39:15.115 --> 39:16.216
But?

39:16.249 --> 39:18.218
But I could've gone to jail.

39:18.251 --> 39:20.921
I could've been shot
by that guy.

39:20.954 --> 39:23.156
But as long as your conscience
stayed protected,

39:23.189 --> 39:24.290
then, hey.

39:33.266 --> 39:35.769
I think I gotta go.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.174
Okay.

39:46.913 --> 39:48.849
(sighs)

39:53.854 --> 39:56.790
(music playing)

40:08.642 --> 40:09.543
You got a second?

40:09.576 --> 40:10.944
Sure.

40:15.716 --> 40:18.752
You told me you put me
on that case to learn,

40:18.785 --> 40:21.221
and I asked what it was
I was supposed to be learning.

40:21.254 --> 40:23.056
Well,

40:23.089 --> 40:25.058
I just wanted you to know,

40:25.091 --> 40:26.960
I did learn.

40:26.993 --> 40:28.394
And, uh...

40:28.428 --> 40:32.432
people bemoan the death
of dignity in our profession.

40:32.465 --> 40:34.801
I just wish more of them
could see you at work.

40:40.841 --> 40:44.778
(door opens and closes)

40:48.014 --> 40:50.884
You did betray her, Jimmy.

40:50.917 --> 40:53.253
In your mind,
it was for her own good, but...

40:54.387 --> 40:55.455
(sighs)

40:55.488 --> 40:56.389
DONNELL: So...

40:56.422 --> 40:57.824
how did you leave it?

40:57.858 --> 41:00.133
I just left.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.902
It's not gonna work for us.

41:01.935 --> 41:04.137
DONNELL: It's too soon
to say that.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.106
But even if this doesn't work,

41:07.808 --> 41:09.175
maybe it's for the best.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.647
Bobby,

41:13.680 --> 41:16.116
I know this sounds stupid,

41:16.149 --> 41:19.853
but I loved her so much

41:19.886 --> 41:22.155
back in high school.

41:22.188 --> 41:25.659
Probably an unhealthy
worship kind of thing.

41:26.860 --> 41:29.596
But it all just came back.

41:29.630 --> 41:31.898
You're not who you were
in high school.

41:31.932 --> 41:33.366
I know this.

41:34.801 --> 41:36.069
Except,

41:36.102 --> 41:38.238
I'm 42 years old,

41:40.774 --> 41:41.975
and I'm lonely.

41:44.144 --> 41:46.112
And men like me,

41:47.881 --> 41:49.883
we don't get women like her.

41:52.953 --> 41:55.421
Jimmy,

41:55.455 --> 41:56.923
there are many,

41:56.957 --> 41:58.792
many women for you.

42:00.634 --> 42:01.401
And one day--

42:01.434 --> 42:03.136
Yeah. I know.

42:07.273 --> 42:09.342
Come on.

42:09.375 --> 42:10.410
Let's go get a beer.

42:10.443 --> 42:12.613
I think I'm gonna sit
for a minute.

42:12.646 --> 42:13.714
You sure?

42:13.747 --> 42:14.881
Yeah.

42:14.915 --> 42:17.283
I'm just gonna sit and--

42:17.317 --> 42:18.685
I'm fine.

42:18.719 --> 42:20.020
You sure?

42:20.053 --> 42:22.255
I'm fine.

42:24.290 --> 42:26.326
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:26.359 --> 42:28.762
Yup.

42:28.795 --> 42:30.230
First thing.

42:30.263 --> 42:33.166
(music playing)

42:52.619 --> 42:55.556
(music playing)

43:17.317 --> 43:18.251
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:20.253 --> 43:22.989
(music playing)
