00:01.469 --> 00:03.137
Previously on Hawaii Five-O:
You want me to go undercover?

00:03.171 --> 00:07.208
I need to keep a close eye
on a local Yakuza boss.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.776
Guy by the name
of Hideki Tashiro.

00:08.809 --> 00:11.279
JESSIE: If I do this,
am I gonna end up dead?

00:11.312 --> 00:12.746
I'll protect you.
You have my word.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.747
All right, Noshimuri.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.116
You got yourself a CI.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.517
I need to be able to trust

00:16.550 --> 00:18.252
the people in my crew.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.121
I just did a six-year stretch.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.390
Could have been six months
if I'd given up my crew.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.558
But the next time you go away,
it'll be for life.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.761
Time like that
would get anyone talking.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.263
Important thing
is you're in now.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.364
Looks that way.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.699
But if he finds out
what's going on,

00:31.732 --> 00:33.201
my life is over.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.545
*

01:11.439 --> 01:14.675
*

01:33.494 --> 01:35.463
On your knees!

01:38.199 --> 01:39.233
I got 'em.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.434
We're in chem storage.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.543
MAN :
Jake, do you copy? Jake.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.569
GUARD :
Anyone got a visual?

02:15.603 --> 02:17.671
GUARD 2: Cameras picked 'em up
on the east side.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.140
Everyone to the loading docks.
Let's move.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.287
GUARD: Stop! Stop!
Get out of the truck!

02:42.263 --> 02:44.232
Go, go, go, go!

03:05.819 --> 03:09.223
(Hawaii Five-O
theme song plays)

03:40.888 --> 03:42.323
All right, good boy, good boy.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.258
Right here.
Come here, come here.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.993
Let's go.
Keep it moving. Sit.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.995
Come on, come on.
Keep it moving.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.730
Let's go.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.539
STEVE:
Good.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.547
Better have snacks
for everybody.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.715
This? No, this is

04:07.748 --> 04:09.550
a bug-out six-person

04:09.583 --> 04:10.551
doomsday survival pack.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.685
It doesn't have snacks.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.653
It has rations.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.489
Got your stroganoff,
your shrimp fried rice,

04:15.523 --> 04:16.657
your traveler's stew.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.726
Just add water,
you're good to go.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.028
We don't have no water
in here, Jerry.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.496
It sounds tasty.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.264
JERRY:
I have cold packs.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.571
What's that look?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.640
Really?
You have to ask?

04:32.673 --> 04:34.508
Yeah, I gotta ask. What the
hell's the matter with you?

04:34.542 --> 04:35.776
Why don't you take
this seriously?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.077
Just for me once.
That's all.
I'm...

04:37.110 --> 04:38.712
I mean, I-I showed up.
I'm standing here.

04:38.746 --> 04:39.980
What's the problem?
Yeah, but you're not...

04:40.013 --> 04:41.615
you're not moving with
any type of urgency.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.617
I mean, if this were...
Listen to me. If this were

04:43.651 --> 04:45.319
a real, actual nuclear
attack instead of

04:45.353 --> 04:46.654
a mandatory drill, you
would've been vaporized.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.888
How about that?
I'm pretty sure,

04:47.921 --> 04:49.457
if this was, uh,
an actual attack,

04:49.490 --> 04:51.392
we... we'd all be dead.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.894
I mean,
you think that this...

04:53.927 --> 04:55.463
this room is gonna...
is gonna withstand

04:55.496 --> 04:56.930
a nuclear attack?

04:58.065 --> 05:00.334
Yes, I do, actually.
Absolutely.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.503
DANNY:
Okay. Um, let's just say

05:02.536 --> 05:05.539
that, uh, a missile
that would, uh,

05:05.573 --> 05:07.941
completely destroy everything,
eradicate this island

05:07.975 --> 05:10.110
from the planet, somehow
does not penetrate

05:10.143 --> 05:12.380
this, uh, 12-by-20-foot

05:12.413 --> 05:14.582
cinderblock box.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.449
Then what?

05:15.483 --> 05:17.084
Then what are we
gonna do?

05:17.117 --> 05:18.285
You want
to survive that?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.554
Wh-What do you think, uh,
Armageddon's gonna look like?

05:20.588 --> 05:22.356
Wh

05:23.724 --> 05:25.626
Twinkies and cockroaches?

05:25.659 --> 05:26.827
Maybe.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.529
Nuclear winter.
Nuclear winter.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.630
That's correct.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.764
A big, empty,

05:30.798 --> 05:32.666
radioactive wasteland.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.403
Just a barren, ugly space,
but we will all be safe

05:35.436 --> 05:37.538
and cozy in this miserable box.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.706
I mean, that sounds

05:38.739 --> 05:41.475
worse than death
to me, you know?

05:41.509 --> 05:42.910
Being stuck in here,
respectfully,

05:42.943 --> 05:44.011
with all you people.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.646
And let... okay,
you remember, um...

05:45.679 --> 05:46.780
uh, quarantine?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.982
It'd be like that,
only forever.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.953
For the rest of the flick,
just stuck together in a room.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.488
Let's just say

05:54.522 --> 05:56.056
that we make it
past the, uh,

05:56.089 --> 05:57.791
nuclear fallout.
Let's say that that...

05:57.825 --> 05:59.560
that goes away, and
then we step outside.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.894
What if... what
if it's just us?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.830
What if we're the only
people left on Earth?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.565
Then what? Wh-What are
we supposed to do?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.099
Uh...

06:06.133 --> 06:07.901
repopulate?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.839
That's a hard "no."
STEVE: What's the opposite

06:11.872 --> 06:13.106
of a motivational speaker?

06:13.140 --> 06:15.643
'Cause whatever that is,
you're that, okay?

06:15.676 --> 06:16.910
GROVER:
Yeah... I don't know.

06:16.944 --> 06:20.614
No, I-I think my
man got a point.

06:20.648 --> 06:21.949
STEVE:
Okay, hold on, hold on.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.451
First of all,
don't listen to him.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.085
Second of all,
it's highly unlikely

06:25.118 --> 06:27.087
that we would be
the only survivors. Jerry?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.089
Right? Thank you.
Thank you, okay?

06:29.122 --> 06:31.024
So we would be alive.
We would be, uh,

06:31.058 --> 06:32.993
roughing it a little bit,
but we'd be alive,

06:33.026 --> 06:35.028
we'd have each other,
we would rebuild.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.730
'Cause that's
what humans do.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.798
Right? We fight.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.502
Right?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.637
Yeah, I think I'd
take nuke death.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.806
Yep.
Yeah, I'm going to
take the missile.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.042
I didn't ask you.

06:49.076 --> 06:52.480
To a... to a
fiery apocalypse.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.014
Love you.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.082
JERRY:
Well...

06:55.115 --> 06:57.551
looks like it's just gonna
be you and me, Commander.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.888
Hope you like freeze-dried
astronaut ice cream.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.590
I have chocolate.
Come on, Eddie.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.824
Come on.
Cookie dough.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.893
Or my favorite mash-up,
Neapolitan.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.696
DANNY:
Why would you look at the books?

07:08.729 --> 07:09.897
You're not supposed
to look at the books.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.164
No, no, what you said is that

07:11.198 --> 07:12.633
I "shouldn't worry"
about the books.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.967
But I do, Danny.
I worry about the books

07:14.001 --> 07:15.168
'cause that's my job--
the business.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.004
The kitchen is your job,
which is why

07:17.037 --> 07:18.238
you should have,
uh, consulted me

07:18.271 --> 07:20.140
before you gave
your Uncle Vito a per diem.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.942
I gotta give him money.
He's working. I got...

07:21.975 --> 07:23.644
He's what
Let's examine that statement.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.212
He works. He is working.
Right Does he?

07:25.245 --> 07:26.780
He works.
Let's... let's do
a little recap.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.248
How about that?
Okay, okay.
I'd rather not do it.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.017
He blew half
our-our design budget

07:30.050 --> 07:31.519
on a pornographic statue.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.186
We don't have to use the
pornographic statue.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.155
He was arrested for bribing
the liquor commissioner.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.924
It's been bumpy--
I understand that.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.559
Bumpy? That's an
understatement.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.260
Okay. Would you just let
me tell you something?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.962
Go.
Okay? I understand
how this guy works,

07:41.995 --> 07:43.731
and I know that it's
not how you work.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.932
All right?

07:44.965 --> 07:45.999
Yeah.
I promise you,
on opening night,

07:46.033 --> 07:48.135
you are gonna be eating a
nice plate of agnolotti,

07:48.168 --> 07:49.970
saying, "Thank God
we had Vito," okay?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.204
Yeah, well,
I hope you're right.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.073
Except for the agnolotti part.
I don't eat veal.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.008
Stop, okay?

07:55.042 --> 07:57.010
Agnolotti is not veal,
all right?

07:57.044 --> 07:58.612
It's like a... a ravioli.

07:58.646 --> 07:59.847
And you should
know this because

07:59.880 --> 08:01.114
we are opening an
Italian restaurant.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.250
Do your homework.
Well, if we open.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.787
Adam.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.791
Everything all right?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.225
Actually, no.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.227
Is this about Hideki's money?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.096
Something else.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.932
You know about this?

08:21.268 --> 08:23.704
Yeah, the break-in at
I.X. Chemical. Why?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.806
It was me and Jessie.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.242
Okay. I presume this also

08:29.276 --> 08:31.078
has something
to do with Hideki.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.746
He's moved into
meth production.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.181
The chlorine gas is
a key ingredient,

08:34.214 --> 08:35.649
so he needs a
steady supply.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.884
Last night, he
called Jessie,

08:36.917 --> 08:38.251
said it was time
to restock.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.253
I went with her
to watch her back.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.856
Jessie then turned the chlorine
over to Hideki's people,

08:42.890 --> 08:45.593
and I tracked it to a
meth house in Kalihi.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.860
Okay. What's the problem?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.028
Problem is I've
since discovered

08:48.061 --> 08:49.863
that one of Hideki's soldiers,

08:49.897 --> 08:51.732
Kazuya Nemoto,
went behind his back

08:51.765 --> 08:53.601
and sold a couple tanks
to someone else.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.704
Now, I'm not sure who this
buyer is or how to find them.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.006
All I know is, they're
not in the meth business.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.746
Um, I presume you know what else

09:05.779 --> 09:08.148
chlorine gas can be used
to make, right?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.883
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.919
All right, you said
"a couple tanks."

09:11.952 --> 09:13.854
Exactly how much
liquid chlorine gas

09:13.887 --> 09:16.256
does this other buyer have?
Two tanks,

09:16.289 --> 09:19.026
each 150 pounds,
which is roughly...

09:19.059 --> 09:20.828
25 gallons of liquid chlorine.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.130
What kind of numbers

09:23.163 --> 09:25.032
are we looking at here?
It's enough to make

09:25.065 --> 09:26.700
a weapon that would kill
thousands of people.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.903
Look, Steve, I...

09:29.937 --> 09:31.839
What's done is done.
All right, um...

09:33.406 --> 09:35.008
I'm gonna loop in the governor.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.010
All right? See if we can
get ahead of this thing.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.613
I need you to fill in the team.
Right now, it's just a gas.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.949
Let's see if we can catch 'em
before it becomes anything else.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.234
GROVER:
You all right?

10:02.302 --> 10:03.971
Yeah.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.339
We're gonna get
those tanks back.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.175
This is just the first step.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.010
Yeah, what if we don't?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.645
You can't think
that way.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.981
Look.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.916
You couldn't have had any idea

10:15.949 --> 10:17.951
that something like this
was gonna happen.

10:18.986 --> 10:22.690
Yeah, well, that doesn't
make me feel any better.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.091
The hardest part
about doing this job

10:24.124 --> 10:25.759
is keeping your emotions
in check.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.828
If you don't keep your
emotions in check,

10:27.861 --> 10:30.130
it's gonna cloud your judgment
out in the field.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.934
You gotta suck it up and...

10:33.967 --> 10:37.237
push your guilt aside
and focus on the endgame.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.712
You sure this is gonna work?

10:44.745 --> 10:48.215
Well, we will find out
soon enough.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.286
Hey.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.789
You Kazuya Nemoto?

10:57.457 --> 10:59.693
I'm just playing with you.

10:59.727 --> 11:02.129
How you doing?
I'm Captain Lou Grover.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.364
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.267
Um, well, this here
is Officer Tani Rey.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.902
And we're with
the Five-O Task Force.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.270
And today is your lucky day

11:10.303 --> 11:12.272
because the boss
was in such a good mood,

11:12.305 --> 11:14.742
he decided to send over
two of the more affable

11:14.775 --> 11:16.409
members of the task force

11:16.443 --> 11:18.011
just to have
a little chat with you.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.747
"Affable"?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.148
What's that?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.183
It means service
with a smile.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.421
But those smiles
are gonna dry up right away

11:28.455 --> 11:30.991
if you decide you don't want
to cooperate.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.425
I know my rights.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.895
I don't have to talk
to either of you.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.429
All right, fine,
you can just listen.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.397
I mean, after all, we know

11:37.430 --> 11:39.166
how this conversation
is gonna go, right?

11:39.199 --> 11:41.034
We do. Right.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.236
Why don't I help you?
We're gonna start by saying

11:43.270 --> 11:44.838
that we know
that you were responsible

11:44.872 --> 11:47.307
for the robbery
at I.X. Chemical last night.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.911
You're gonna say,
"What Pfft. No!

11:50.944 --> 11:52.179
I'm not responsible
for that."

11:52.212 --> 11:54.214
We're gonna say,
"That's not what we heard."

11:54.247 --> 11:55.916
And then we're gonna
show you this.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.120
GROVER : This was
like every other delivery?

12:00.153 --> 12:04.457
No. Nemoto drops off ten tanks
every month, like clockwork.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.294
Only last night, I got eight.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.062
I asked Nemoto about it.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.131
He said two of 'em
got lost in transit,

12:11.164 --> 12:13.333
that I had to make it work.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.335
GROVER:
"Lost in transit."

12:15.368 --> 12:17.337
Now, what in the hell
does that mean?

12:17.370 --> 12:19.206
Wait a second.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.810
You're not actually gonna try
to convince us that two

12:22.843 --> 12:24.778
chlorine gas tanks
literally fell

12:24.812 --> 12:26.980
off the back of a truck,
are you?

12:27.014 --> 12:28.315
TANI:
Yeah, you got
another offer

12:28.348 --> 12:30.283
on those tanks, didn't you?

12:32.252 --> 12:35.055
Yeah... you got nothing here.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.357
That dude will say
anything to save his ass,

12:37.390 --> 12:39.126
but he's got no proof.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.094
Plus, you really think
the uncorroborated testimony

12:41.128 --> 12:43.496
of a guy like that is
gonna stand up in a court?

12:43.530 --> 12:47.968
Assuming, of course, that he
even makes it alive to testify.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.269
Oh, that's dark.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.839
But if I were you,
I'd be kind of worried

12:51.872 --> 12:53.440
about my own survival.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.443
See, once your boss,
Hideki, finds out

12:56.476 --> 12:59.980
that there's two missing tanks--
and believe me,

13:00.013 --> 13:01.348
she'll make sure
he finds out...

13:03.016 --> 13:04.251
...where's that
gonna leave you?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.253
I'll tell you
where it leaves you.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.888
You're a marked man now, buddy.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.189
Which is good for us,

13:09.222 --> 13:11.091
'cause we got
a pool going as to

13:11.124 --> 13:13.827
which one of you's gonna
drop first, you or Roland.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.429
My money's on your ass.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.400
All right.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.035
I got a better offer.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.837
Oh.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.272
But I don't know the guy's name.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.506
He found me through
another cook

13:26.539 --> 13:28.575
I used to do business with--
Akira Morita.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.143
TANI:
All right.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.879
You want to keep this
between us,

13:31.912 --> 13:33.313
you better do better than that.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.982
Oh, no, Officer.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.584
I swear, I didn't get a name,
but...

13:37.617 --> 13:38.551
I can tell you

13:38.585 --> 13:40.888
where I dropped off the
chlorine last night.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.523
It was a house in Makiki.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.592
There were some guys there.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.994
A few guys?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.328
What'd they look like?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.529
I don't know.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.865
Just regular guys-- haoles.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.000
Real vanilla types.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.201
Like accountants.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.036
Gym teachers.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.204
Mmm.

13:57.237 --> 14:01.308
Now, see, that information there
is the kind of information

14:01.341 --> 14:03.110
makes me smile.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.914
MAN:
On three.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.316
Ready? One, two, three.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.154
Easy, easy, easy.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.426
Let's get the other one.

14:28.101 --> 14:31.071
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

14:31.104 --> 14:33.173
Hey, guys, give me a hand here!

14:33.206 --> 14:34.607
Come on.
Help me shut it off.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.144
No!

14:37.177 --> 14:38.946
No, no, no, no, no! No!

14:38.979 --> 14:40.914
Come on, open the door! Please!

14:40.948 --> 14:42.215
What are you doing?

14:42.249 --> 14:43.450
Get him out of there.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.487
No! You open these doors,
we're all dead!

14:47.520 --> 14:48.488
Help us!

14:48.521 --> 14:50.991
Come on!
Mitchell! Mitchell!

14:51.024 --> 14:52.559
Please! Please help me!

14:52.592 --> 14:55.996
Please, Mitchell!
Mitchell!

14:56.029 --> 14:58.932
Akani! Akani!

14:58.966 --> 15:00.167
Akani, please!

15:00.200 --> 15:01.969
No! No!

15:30.363 --> 15:33.033
*

15:56.423 --> 15:59.959
Junior, call
Hazmat right now.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.434
Please... help!

16:35.662 --> 16:37.197
Adam's gonna follow them
to the hospital.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.099
This guy comes to,
maybe he can tell us

16:39.132 --> 16:41.101
what the hell is going on.
That would be nice,

16:41.134 --> 16:43.336
seeing as how there's still one
of those tanks unaccounted for.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.671
TANI:
Okay, I spoke to the owner.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.306
She says that she rented
this place to the perps

16:46.339 --> 16:48.641
through one of those
short-term rental sites.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.777
I just ran the names.
They look like they're fake.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.745
I looked into that
van, too, by the way.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.215
They purchased it from
Craigslist a week ago,

16:55.248 --> 16:57.650
and they paid for it
with a cashier's check.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.818
Hey, uh, HPD's still canvassing.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.720
Uh, I just spoke
to one of the neighbors.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.589
He says that he saw
four guys coming

17:02.622 --> 17:05.125
in and out of here
over the last few days.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.227
Unfortunately, he was unable
to get a good look at them.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.428
All right, so there's four guys.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.130
How does one
end up being gassed?

17:10.163 --> 17:11.598
Maybe he was trying
to back out of whatever

17:11.631 --> 17:13.066
it is they're planning to do.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.467
I mean, there's a lot
easier ways

17:14.501 --> 17:15.835
to kill somebody, first of all.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.071
Second of all,
why go through all the risk?

17:18.105 --> 17:19.672
Yeah, I'm with Danny.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.274
These guys ain't
rocket scientists.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.143
The whole thing was
probably an accident.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.611
Mishandled the tanks,

17:24.644 --> 17:26.646
and gas starts escaping,
the other three

17:26.679 --> 17:28.481
leap out to save
their own ass.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.284
JUNIOR:
Hey, you okay?

17:31.318 --> 17:33.520
Yeah, I'm fine.
What, uh... what do you think

17:33.553 --> 17:36.089
the symptoms are of being
exposed to this stuff?

17:36.123 --> 17:37.824
I don't think we were exposed.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.492
Why

17:39.526 --> 17:42.462
Well, chlorine gas
is a lot heavier than oxygen.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.831
Unless it was
intentionally dispersed,

17:44.864 --> 17:46.065
it just settles.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.535
Most of it would've just stayed
contained inside the van.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.104
DANNY:
Oh. What, are you an expert now?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.741
All clear.
You guys can go in.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.709
Oh, excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me. One second.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.178
Uh, my friend, he told me

17:58.211 --> 17:59.779
that he doesn't think
that we got exposed.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.814
We were in that house
for a little while.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.650
I'm curious-- in your
expert opinion,

18:03.683 --> 18:05.152
what do you think?

18:05.185 --> 18:07.354
You're fine.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.723
What, do you feel
like a smart guy now?

18:10.757 --> 18:11.958
Like you know everything?
No.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.661
No? Go follow them to the amb...
to the hospital.
Yes, sir.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.464
Okay.
If the guy wakes up,
you call me right away.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.267
GROVER: CSU's pulled
four sets of prints so far.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.768
None of them
are in the system.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.570
I guess Nemoto
was telling the truth.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.238
It's all ordinary,
regular guys.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.240
I mean, till now.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.576
Okay, so what turns
four regular, ordinary guys

18:29.609 --> 18:32.179
into, uh, domestic terrorists?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.780
TANI:
Perps must have left in a hurry.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.182
They left this behind, though.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.115
It's password-protected,

18:36.149 --> 18:38.351
but I think I can get Jerry
to crack it.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.686
Well, tell him
to make it snappy,

18:39.719 --> 18:40.620
'cause whatever
these guys

18:40.653 --> 18:42.489
have planned,
this little thing with the van

18:42.522 --> 18:43.623
is gonna accelerate
their timetable.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.625
It's Adam.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.260
What's up, buddy?
How's our gas victim doing?

18:47.294 --> 18:48.661
Good news is he's
probably gonna make it.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.897
Bad news is we can't
talk to him yet.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.799
GROVER: How come?
Doctors put him in

18:52.832 --> 18:54.334
a medically induced coma.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.435
Turns out the gas
didn't just burn

18:55.468 --> 18:57.904
his skin and his throat;
it also got into his lungs.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.772
How long till they take him
out of it?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.574
Did they say?
Uh, no. Not yet.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.476
But we did get something useful.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.545
He had his cell phone
and his wallet on him.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.879
The guy's name
is Kevin Randall.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.548
He's a real estate agent
in Waikiki.

19:08.581 --> 19:09.782
We did a check on him.

19:09.816 --> 19:10.950
He's got no priors.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.752
We also went through
his cell history.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.787
Last call he made
was to his wife, Denise.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.657
Looks like he placed it
while he was still in the van.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.791
Probably calling
to say good-bye.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.826
All right,
thanks, buddy.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.767
Denise Randall?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.502
Yes?
My name's Captain
Lou Grover.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.837
This is Officer Tani Rey.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.472
We're with the Five-O
Task Force.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.241
Ma'am, we need
to ask you some questions

19:34.274 --> 19:36.443
about your
husband, Kevin.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.446
Did something happen
at the open house?

19:40.713 --> 19:43.816
Mrs. Randall, did your husband
call you this morning?

19:43.850 --> 19:46.553
Yes, but I was taking a nap,
and it went to voice mail.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.255
I haven't listened
to the message yet.

19:48.288 --> 19:51.591
Can someone please
tell me what's going on?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.928
KEVIN :
I screwed up.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.730
I-I'm so... I'm so sorry.

19:57.764 --> 20:01.301
I'm not gonna be there
to take care of you.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.304
But you're gonna be fine, okay?

20:04.337 --> 20:06.706
You... you are so strong.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.376
:
I love you so much, Dee.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.713
I have to go.
Mrs. Randall,

20:13.746 --> 20:15.715
please take your seat.
We're not done yet.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.450
I have to be with Kevin.
You just need to answer

20:17.484 --> 20:19.519
a few questions for us,
and then we have HPD ready

20:19.552 --> 20:21.321
to take you to the hospital
when we're done.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.889
Okay?

20:25.792 --> 20:27.594
Mrs. Randall, we suspect

20:27.627 --> 20:29.729
that Kevin and three other guys

20:29.762 --> 20:32.599
are planning
some sort of an attack.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.368
No. No, there must be a mistake.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.504
Kevin would never hurt anyone.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.239
Has he been particularly upset
with anyone lately?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.776
It's been a rough year for us.

20:43.810 --> 20:47.547
I was diagnosed with cancer
about nine months ago.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.349
We don't have insurance,

20:49.382 --> 20:51.784
so the medical bills
really wiped us out.

20:51.818 --> 20:52.919
Kevin doesn't complain.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.754
He doesn't want to get me down.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.757
With what's going on
with you and...

20:57.790 --> 20:59.592
your situation, do you know

20:59.626 --> 21:02.329
if Kevin's been talking
with anyone or...

21:02.362 --> 21:04.297
shared this with
anyone else?

21:04.331 --> 21:06.899
Um... there's a...

21:06.933 --> 21:09.702
a message board he goes on, uh,

21:09.736 --> 21:11.604
a lot-- one of those
online support groups.

21:11.638 --> 21:15.408
It's for people with loved ones
who have cancer. Um...

21:17.477 --> 21:18.611
He tried to hide it
from me.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.579
Didn't want me getting upset.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.814
But I saw him on there
a few times, and...

21:21.848 --> 21:24.717
I was just glad he had
someone to talk to.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.854
Do you know if he's met up
with anybody from the group?

21:29.556 --> 21:31.057
I-I don't know.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.326
I know he likes
to go out at night

21:33.360 --> 21:36.529
after he thinks I'm asleep,
but...

21:36.563 --> 21:40.800
I just thought it was 'cause
he needed some time to himself.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.846
Denise said
that her medical bills

21:53.880 --> 21:55.448
wiped them out, right?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.817
That's right.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.852
Do you think that
this whole chlorine thing

21:59.886 --> 22:01.588
could be a play for money?

22:02.589 --> 22:03.723
Like how?

22:03.756 --> 22:05.892
I mean, Kevin meets
these guys online.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.527
They start talking.
It's the same thing.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.661
They're in the same situation.

22:08.695 --> 22:11.798
Maybe they come up with
some sort of extortion scheme.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.700
You know, they threaten
to release the gas

22:13.733 --> 22:14.767
if the city doesn't pay up.

22:16.068 --> 22:19.706
I know, it sounds
supervillain-y-- I get it--

22:19.739 --> 22:21.508
but I'm saying we're not...

22:21.541 --> 22:23.376
we're not dealing
with regular bad guys here.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.511
When I was at
the academy,

22:24.544 --> 22:27.647
Captain Keo always used to say,
consider every option,

22:27.680 --> 22:30.583
no matter how cray-cray
it might be.

22:30.617 --> 22:33.386
Ain't that the guy that you got
kicked out of the academy

22:33.420 --> 22:34.821
for punching in the face?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.856
That's him. Yes.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.392
Okay.
:
I'm just saying...

22:39.426 --> 22:40.860
you know, we gotta...

22:40.893 --> 22:42.729
we gotta start thinking
outside the box.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.465
Okay. All right, maybe
it is an extortion play.

22:45.498 --> 22:48.100
If that's the case, we need
to get Jerry searching out

22:48.134 --> 22:50.503
what Internet forum that Kevin
might have belonged to.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.739
Because, if that's where he met
his accomplices,

22:52.772 --> 22:55.074
we got an excellent
chance of I.D.'ing them.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.009
Right. I mean, searching
the entire Internet

22:57.043 --> 22:59.812
for a particular
message board, it's...

22:59.846 --> 23:01.881
it's gonna take a lot of time.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.483
Time we don't have.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.151
Well...

23:05.184 --> 23:07.454
there is one other option.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.688
Absolutely not.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.857
Look, we know this goes against
hospital protocol, but...

23:10.890 --> 23:12.625
This isn't about
hospital protocol.

23:12.659 --> 23:15.161
This is about my duty
to Kevin Randall as his doctor.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.664
It's not medically advisable
to bring him out of this coma,

23:17.697 --> 23:18.731
even for a few minutes.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.100
Dr. Price, a lot of people
could be in grave danger,

23:21.133 --> 23:23.035
and Mr. Randall
may be the only person

23:23.069 --> 23:24.971
who can provide us
with information.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.773
We need to talk
to him right now.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.475
Even if I agreed to do this,

23:28.508 --> 23:30.477
the shock to his system alone
might kill him.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.644
I'm sorry.
The answer's no.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.045
Doc, I don't think
you fully appreciate

23:33.079 --> 23:35.047
the situation we're in here.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.784
A situation we're in
because of Kevin.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.686
Now, if we don't
question him, and soon,

23:39.719 --> 23:41.153
this entire hospital
could be inundated

23:41.187 --> 23:42.789
with thousands
of innocent people

23:42.822 --> 23:44.624
suffering from
the same condition or worse.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.825
And I'll tell you
something else--

23:45.858 --> 23:47.193
if you don't do the right thing

23:47.226 --> 23:49.095
and help us, then
you're complicit

23:49.128 --> 23:50.697
in making that happen.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.832
Now, can you live with that?

23:54.867 --> 23:57.837
So, I managed to unlock
that laptop that you guys found

23:57.870 --> 23:59.839
using some password
recovery software.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.073
And I found something
interesting

24:01.107 --> 24:02.542
in the browser history.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.644
Multiple searches to see
how much chlorine gas

24:04.677 --> 24:06.112
it would take to
kill 200 people.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.780
200 people--
that's very specific.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.082
Yeah, it's also a lot
smaller than I would think.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.951
I mean, if you're
gonna plan an attack,

24:11.984 --> 24:13.686
wouldn't you want to
maximize casualties?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.154
GROVER: Not if you're
targeting a certain

24:15.187 --> 24:16.388
group of people.

24:16.422 --> 24:19.091
What if these guys are trying
to hold somebody responsible

24:19.125 --> 24:22.261
for whatever happened to
Denise Randall and whoever else?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.263
All right, uh, anything else
in the browser history

24:24.296 --> 24:27.066
that would shed some light
on who they were targeting?

24:27.099 --> 24:29.101
No, but there was something.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.671
They were also looking at
the schematics for a specific

24:31.704 --> 24:34.607
HVAC system,
one that was manufactured in '92

24:34.641 --> 24:36.142
to be used in medium-sized
office buildings.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.244
TANI: Seems like
they're looking to release

24:38.277 --> 24:40.680
the chlorine gas
into a ventilation system.

24:40.713 --> 24:41.981
This is good, Jerry.
Run a search.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.282
Um, all the buildings
on the island,

24:43.315 --> 24:45.284
a minimum capacity of 200,

24:45.317 --> 24:47.987
that are running
that same HVAC system.

24:48.020 --> 24:51.057
Maybe we can narrow it down,
at least evacuate the buildings.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.091
JERRY:
Here we go.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.266
That's hundreds of buildings.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.535
If we're right about these guys
speeding up the clock,

25:02.569 --> 25:05.137
we'll never have time
to search all of those.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.546
DISPATCHER: All units,
please advise, there is

25:13.580 --> 25:14.914
a possible chemical threat.
Search and evacuate

25:14.947 --> 25:16.616
all buildings
in a six-block radius

25:16.649 --> 25:18.284
of the governor's office.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.820
(tires squealing,
sirens blaring)

25:40.740 --> 25:42.742
Yo, I just spoke to Grover.
He looped me in.

25:42.775 --> 25:43.910
How'd it go with
the governor?

25:43.943 --> 25:46.646
Horrible.
As bad as you can expect.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.180
Where are we at
with this guy Randall?

25:48.214 --> 25:49.949
We are nowhere.
Uh, I spoke to Adam

25:49.982 --> 25:51.718
a little while ago,
and the, uh, hospital

25:51.751 --> 25:53.285
will not let him out of his coma

25:53.319 --> 25:55.722
under any
circumstance.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.824
All right. How's Adam?

25:57.857 --> 25:59.225
Uh, I guess he's okay.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.227
He's blaming himself.

26:02.862 --> 26:03.930
Hello?

26:03.963 --> 26:05.064
JERRY:
Hey, it's me.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.137
What are you...
what are you doing?

26:11.170 --> 26:12.939
What, you can't walk seven feet,

26:12.972 --> 26:15.207
knock on the door?
Yeah, I didn't want
to interrupt.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.176
You look pretty serious.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.980
Uh, you're still interrupting.

26:21.013 --> 26:24.150
It's just, uh, now you're
doing it on the phone.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.351
Well...

26:25.384 --> 26:26.886
this is kind of important.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.121
Okay.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.023
So, I found
a sub-page on Reddit

26:31.057 --> 26:32.358
that's a cancer
support group.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.326
And I came across
an anonymous user

26:34.360 --> 26:36.162
who mentions
Denise by name,

26:36.195 --> 26:38.164
along with her age
and all her symptoms.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.231
So that's...

26:39.265 --> 26:40.266
Kevin Randall, right?

26:40.299 --> 26:41.801
Yeah, and based
on the user history,

26:41.834 --> 26:43.870
it looks like he posted
on a regular basis.

26:43.903 --> 26:46.105
As you might expect,
other people on this sub

26:46.138 --> 26:47.740
had family members
with the same illness.

26:47.774 --> 26:48.808
In fact, most of them

26:48.841 --> 26:50.810
believed that they were part
of a cancer cluster.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.078
DANNY:
Okay, so that would confirm

26:52.111 --> 26:55.848
our theory about how Kevin
got his accomplices.

26:55.882 --> 26:58.751
Any way of I.D.'ing these guys
through their posts?

26:58.785 --> 27:00.953
I tried, but they're all
logging in through TOR.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.755
So they were cloaked.
Afraid so.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.123
But I did find
something else.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.692
At one point,
there was a thread

27:05.725 --> 27:08.094
where they talked about filing
a class action lawsuit.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.763
Who were they gonna file a
class action lawsuit against?

27:10.797 --> 27:12.431
I-I think they
were still trying

27:12.464 --> 27:14.000
to figure that out
when they met.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.768
That's the thing
about a cancer cluster.

27:15.802 --> 27:19.105
It can take time to figure out
who or what is the cause of it.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.173
But Kevin himself talked about
reaching out to a lawyer.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.776
Did any of them mention
the lawyer by name?

27:23.810 --> 27:25.778
Yeah. You're not gonna
believe who it is.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.821
GROVER:
Well, this I cannot believe.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.756
LG.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.390
Odell, my man.

27:38.424 --> 27:39.726
Long time, brutha.
Yes, sir.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.294
Odell Martin.
Hi.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.429
Tani Rey.

27:43.462 --> 27:46.298
Five-O, next gen. Very cool.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.034
Wait. How'd you find me?

27:48.067 --> 27:50.036
Come on, man.
We the police.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.437
We pinged your cell.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.806
Big Brother.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.142
You know, when you didn't answer
your phone, I kind of figured

27:56.175 --> 27:57.476
you'd be down
at Chun's or Pipeline

27:57.509 --> 27:59.478
catching the last
of the winter waves.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.782
Who'd have thought you'd be down
here cooped up in a law library?

28:02.815 --> 28:04.083
What up with that?

28:04.116 --> 28:05.818
ODELL: What can I say?
After the Sang Min case,

28:05.852 --> 28:07.954
I started picking up
a few clients here and there.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.822
One thing led to the next.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.958
Suddenly, I got a little
law practice on the side.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.492
"On the side." Yeah.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.494
Just trying to help
out the little guy.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.929
I feel you. I feel you.

28:16.963 --> 28:18.197
What can I do for you?
Yeah, actually,

28:18.230 --> 28:21.500
we-we wanted to talk to you
about one of those little guys.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.969
You know
Kevin Randall?

28:23.002 --> 28:24.737
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.106
Well, I can't really
get into that.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.008
You know, attorney-client
privilege and all.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.343
Yeah, well, counselor,
we also know

28:31.377 --> 28:33.312
there are exceptions
to that thing.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.147
And the situation
we have here

28:35.181 --> 28:36.348
kind of warrants it.
Hey!

28:36.382 --> 28:37.750
You and your friends

28:37.784 --> 28:39.251
want to zip it?
This is a library.

28:39.285 --> 28:40.920
TANI:
Yeah, babe, and
this is a badge.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.055
You want see the gun?

28:45.291 --> 28:47.293
McGarrett must've
recruited you personally.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.929
Settle down there, Hoss.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.831
Why don't we go
someplace private

28:51.864 --> 28:54.767
and discuss this before
Annie Oakley loses her cool.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.139
Is he gonna make it?

29:00.172 --> 29:01.874
Could go either way.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.075
Look, here's what
we need to know

29:03.109 --> 29:05.778
right now-- did Kevin or any
of his friends ever talk to you

29:05.812 --> 29:07.013
about anybody they
wanted to sue

29:07.046 --> 29:08.347
in particular?
Yeah.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.883
Agrocore.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.852
The guys who make the GMOs?
Yep.

29:12.885 --> 29:15.187
GMOs, biofuels, pesticides.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.956
They got a facility
here on the island.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.390
Kevin and the
rest of them

29:18.424 --> 29:19.826
live nearby.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.794
They're convinced
chemicals from the place

29:21.828 --> 29:24.363
found their way into the
groundwater, causing cancer.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.932
STEVE :
Yeah, Lou.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.433
Steve, we're here
with Odell.

29:27.466 --> 29:28.901
Looks like the target

29:28.935 --> 29:30.169
is Agrocore.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.271
Jerry, Jerry, get Agrocore's
corporate offices

29:32.304 --> 29:34.540
on the line right now, please.
On it.

29:34.573 --> 29:37.109
ODELL:
You know, I never would have
pegged those guys as violent,

29:37.143 --> 29:39.245
but I could almost understand
what might drive them to it.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.579
How so?
Well, I told them--

29:40.612 --> 29:43.549
taking on a huge corporation
like Agrocore,

29:43.582 --> 29:45.151
that's like David

29:45.184 --> 29:47.086
taking on Goliath,
only without the slingshot.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.889
I mean, that company's got
an army of lawyers,

29:49.922 --> 29:50.957
unlimited amounts of cash

29:50.990 --> 29:52.191
and no conscience.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.592
A lawsuit could
take years,

29:53.625 --> 29:55.194
with no guarantee
they'd win.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.528
Especially without
hard proof,

29:56.562 --> 29:58.264
which they didn't really have.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.099
JERRY: Uh, guys,
we have a problem.

30:00.132 --> 30:00.967
TANI:
What is it, Jer?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.568
Looks like Agrocore
has got offices

30:02.601 --> 30:04.603
in five buildings,
not one, so it's gonna

30:04.636 --> 30:06.472
take some time
to evacuate them all.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.174
All right, Jerry,
here's what we do.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.109
Contact the governor's office,
all right?

30:10.142 --> 30:11.978
Have them activate the
nuclear emergency drill

30:12.011 --> 30:13.479
at all five locations.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.114
That way, we get
everybody to safety

30:15.147 --> 30:16.983
without causing panic,
and we create some time

30:17.016 --> 30:19.451
to check these buildings.
ODELL: Wait. Hold up.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.054
I think I might be able
to narrow it down for you.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.890
Now, Agrocore's lead counsel

30:23.923 --> 30:25.491
is this guy named
Marshall Friedkin.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.226
Evil incarnate.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.261
Kevin told me
Friedkin and his team

30:29.295 --> 30:30.596
have been
intimidating everyone

30:30.629 --> 30:33.132
so they'd think
twice about filing.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.500
Even told 'em Agrocore
would countersue.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.936
Didn't even care if they won,
as long as the families

30:36.969 --> 30:38.971
all went bankrupt.
If there's one villain

30:39.005 --> 30:40.439
in this thing, it's him.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.374
All right,
how do we find him?

30:42.408 --> 30:43.375
Bishop Street-- the entire

30:43.409 --> 30:44.210
legal department's there.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.413
All right, Jerry,
prioritize that search

30:47.446 --> 30:48.981
to the Bishop Street
location.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.250
Have Adam and Junior
meet us there, all right?

30:51.283 --> 30:53.285
Odell, mahalo, brother.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.411
Okay, one last time:

31:19.445 --> 31:21.981
Now, there are two
guards in the lobby.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.550
If they ask, we're here
to service the AC.

31:27.653 --> 31:28.687
What?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.289
We really doing this?

31:30.322 --> 31:31.991
What are you
talking about?

31:32.024 --> 31:33.993
I mean, Kevin,
what this stuff did to him...

31:34.026 --> 31:36.662
Are you serious right now?
AKANI: Are you?

31:36.695 --> 31:39.966
We're talking about 200 people
going out like that.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.233
At least.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.534
That sound like

31:42.568 --> 31:44.036
an eye for an eye?

31:44.070 --> 31:47.073
You forgetting
what they did to us?

31:47.106 --> 31:49.175
What they did to your wife?

31:49.208 --> 31:50.242
Your son?

31:50.276 --> 31:53.946
We... we can't let these
bastards hurt anyone else.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.949
And they have to pay
for what they've done.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.951
Yeah.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.320
They will.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.355
But not this way.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.657
You with him on this?

32:06.692 --> 32:08.094
Yeah.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.733
Then go.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.368
Both of you.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.538
I'll handle this myself.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.978
Okay, alerts have been activated

32:26.012 --> 32:27.613
at all five Agrocore buildings,

32:27.646 --> 32:30.349
and Hazmat units
are en route to each.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.683
STEVE: All right,
tell HPD to make sure

32:31.717 --> 32:33.085
those buildings
remain on lockdown

32:33.119 --> 32:34.686
until further notice.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.355
We're gonna handle
Friedkin's building.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.090
HPD needs to secure the rest

32:38.124 --> 32:39.691
and keep everyone
where they are.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.427
MAN:
Let's go, let's go!

32:41.460 --> 32:43.629
Everyone to the basement!

32:43.662 --> 32:45.131
I'm sure it's just
another drill.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.443
STEVE:
All right, Danny,

32:57.476 --> 32:59.111
you and Junior,
you check the roof.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.113
Lou, Tani, start
clearing floors.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.649
Any sign of the gas, you call
it in, get the hell out.

33:03.682 --> 33:04.983
Copy.
Adam, you're with me.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.071
Five-O. Open up.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.543
All right, my name is
Commander Steve McGarrett

33:31.577 --> 33:32.644
with the Five-O Task Force.

33:32.678 --> 33:33.745
This is not a drill.

33:33.779 --> 33:34.813
You understand me?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.448
We have a credible threat.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.284
Everybody stays
in these rooms.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.286
Nobody leave.

33:40.319 --> 33:43.122
Which one of you
is Marshall Friedkin?

33:44.756 --> 33:45.591
Marshall Friedkin.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.693
Which one of you
is Marshall Friedkin?

33:47.726 --> 33:49.495
Uh, he's not here.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.098
What do you mean, he's not here?

33:52.131 --> 33:53.432
Where is he?
Mr. Friedkin has had

33:53.465 --> 33:55.701
meetings with the board
of directors all week.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.603
He's over at
the corporate office downtown.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.206
We're in the wrong building.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.481
I've been trying to get
Friedkin on the phone,

34:09.515 --> 34:10.549
but he's not picking up.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.184
All right, Jerry, listen to me.

34:12.218 --> 34:13.719
Find somebody else that
works in that building--

34:13.752 --> 34:15.287
anybody, doesn't matter--
and call them, please.

34:24.463 --> 34:25.864
Hello?
STEVE: Hello.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.366
This is Commander
Steve McGarrett

34:27.399 --> 34:28.800
with the Five-O
Task Force.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.636
I'm gonna need to speak
with Marshall Friedkin.

34:30.669 --> 34:31.703
It's very important.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.539
I need to speak with
him immediately.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.640
He's not here.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.342
He's up on the ninth floor.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.876
Someone showed up to meet
with him right before the alert,

34:37.909 --> 34:39.445
so he stayed.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.447
Said it didn't matter,
it was just a drill.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.648
Okay, well,
it's not just a drill.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.184
You understand? I need you
and everybody else in that room

34:45.217 --> 34:46.318
to stay just
where you are.

34:46.352 --> 34:47.519
Do not leave that room.

34:47.553 --> 34:48.754
Okay? Please.

35:15.381 --> 35:18.184
*

35:41.740 --> 35:43.209
MAN:
No! Please!

35:43.242 --> 35:45.244
Please!

35:45.277 --> 35:46.545
Freeze!

35:46.578 --> 35:48.180
Five-O! Hey! Freeze!

35:49.781 --> 35:51.683
STEVE:
Adam, go check on Friedkin.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.634
Sir, sir, can you hear my voice?

36:17.943 --> 36:19.411
I have a gunshot victim.

36:19.445 --> 36:22.314
I need paramedics ASAP--
9251 Coral Street.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.453
STEVE:
Doug Manning

36:33.725 --> 36:34.826
Doug?

36:34.860 --> 36:35.827
Stop.

36:35.861 --> 36:36.928
Stop!

36:36.962 --> 36:38.464
Put the weapon down.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.932
Put the gun down, Doug.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.835
They poisoned our families!

36:43.869 --> 36:44.803
I know.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.972
I know everything they did,
and they're not

36:47.005 --> 36:48.740
gonna get away with it,
all right?

36:48.774 --> 36:50.742
One person's already
been hurt today.

36:50.776 --> 36:53.445
You understand? Please don't
make me add to that list.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.747
Look at me, Doug. Look at me.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.350
You want to see
this company pay

36:58.384 --> 36:59.851
for what
they did, right?

36:59.885 --> 37:01.320
Yes.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.754
I need you alive.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.856
All right? I need you alive
for that to happen,

37:04.890 --> 37:06.792
so I need you
to put that gun down.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.461
You and I, we're gonna walk out
of this building.

37:09.495 --> 37:11.630
Okay?
Please, please, Doug.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.932
Put it down.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.935
Come on, man.
I got you.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.737
That's it, buddy.
Put it down.

37:18.770 --> 37:19.538
That's right,
that's right, that's right.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.407
Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.276
It's okay. It's okay.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.479
I'm sorry.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.652
STEVE: It looks like they're
gonna bring Kevin Randall

38:06.685 --> 38:08.987
out of his coma
in a couple of days.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.922
And the guy that we
arrested, Doug Manning,

38:10.956 --> 38:12.591
he'll be arraigned tomorrow.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.360
What about the other two?

38:14.393 --> 38:15.594
GROVER:
HPD picked 'em up

38:15.627 --> 38:16.928
a couple blocks
from the building.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.531
They had 'em in custody
before we even got Manning.

38:19.565 --> 38:21.099
Never should have come to this.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.502
I mean, these guys
weren't born bad.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.871
They are regular people
who suffered,

38:25.904 --> 38:29.074
turned to the system for help,
saw the deck was stacked.

38:29.107 --> 38:31.377
Getting any kind of justice
would take years.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.744
There's no guarantees.

38:32.778 --> 38:33.779
It shouldn't work this way.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.414
I agree with you.
The good news is

38:35.447 --> 38:36.982
that there is something in place

38:37.015 --> 38:39.685
that can help us even
the playing field a little bit.

38:39.718 --> 38:41.953
What's that?

38:41.987 --> 38:43.555
Well, I spoke
to the governor earlier,

38:43.589 --> 38:44.823
and, uh, the State of Hawaii

38:44.856 --> 38:46.425
is going to launch
a full investigation

38:46.458 --> 38:48.827
into Agrocore, which means,
if they are responsible

38:48.860 --> 38:49.795
for everything you say they are,

38:49.828 --> 38:51.697
then the truth is gonna
come out, and you--

38:51.730 --> 38:53.665
my friend, Odell--
will have all

38:53.699 --> 38:55.834
the ammunition you need
to take that company down.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.103
You'll be able to get justice
for Denise Randall

38:58.136 --> 38:59.605
and anybody else involved.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.842
You guys!

39:03.875 --> 39:04.976
Bring it in.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.913
Who's your pal?
Mahalo.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.748
You're welcome, buddy.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.050
Oh, by the way...
What?

39:12.083 --> 39:13.752
Next time you feel the urge

39:13.785 --> 39:16.054
to pick up a pair
of clippers, don't.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.657
I mean, this is...
this is a travesty.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.758
STEVE:
What are you
talking about?

39:19.791 --> 39:21.026
You call me instead, please.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.761
Call you?

39:22.794 --> 39:25.497
"Odell Martin...
bar

39:26.164 --> 39:27.733
Bar-bis-ter.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.936
It's a hybrid of "barber"
and "barrister." Get it?

39:30.969 --> 39:33.038
Yeah, that's, uh...
that's... that's clever.
STEVE: Yeah, I get it.

39:33.071 --> 39:34.773
Very clever.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.390
What are you doing here?

39:58.897 --> 40:00.499
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

40:00.532 --> 40:01.667
Why haven't you
returned my calls?

40:01.700 --> 40:03.769
I've been with Hideki's crew.

40:03.802 --> 40:04.903
What are you doing here?

40:04.936 --> 40:06.071
They could be
watching me, you know.

40:06.104 --> 40:07.673
If someone saw you...
Do you have any idea

40:07.706 --> 40:09.541
what's been going on today?

40:09.575 --> 40:11.577
I heard Five-O picked up Nemoto
for something.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.678
Yeah.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.180
For trying to sell off
two of those tanks we stole

40:15.213 --> 40:16.982
to a group of guys
who were planning

40:17.015 --> 40:19.050
to use them
in a chemical attack.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.952
We stopped them.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.188
I had no idea.

40:23.221 --> 40:26.191
I'm sorry I didn't get
back to you earlier.

40:26.224 --> 40:27.659
Are you?

40:27.693 --> 40:30.128
What's that supposed to mean?

40:33.098 --> 40:35.601
Why are you looking
at me like that?

40:35.634 --> 40:37.536
Whose side are you on?

40:37.569 --> 40:38.470
Excuse me?

40:38.504 --> 40:40.539
I've been listening
to the conversations

40:40.572 --> 40:42.073
you had with Nemoto.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.542
Trying to figure out why

40:43.575 --> 40:45.076
what happened today
wasn't on our radar.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.846
You think I knew he was
going to sell those tanks?

40:47.879 --> 40:49.214
There's a gap on the tape.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.683
I had the lab do an analysis.

40:51.717 --> 40:53.184
They said you stopped recording
for eight minutes.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.352
I want to know why.

40:54.385 --> 40:57.756
Must have been a glitch.
Some problem with the recorder.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.991
"Glitch." The truth, Jessie.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.560
Okay, yeah.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.761
I stopped recording

41:02.794 --> 41:03.995
for a few minutes.

41:04.029 --> 41:05.764
Why?

41:07.032 --> 41:09.067
Because what Kazuya and I
were talking about...

41:10.201 --> 41:11.903
...it was personal.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.910
You're sleeping with him?

41:21.847 --> 41:24.616
Do you have any idea
how dangerous

41:24.650 --> 41:25.917
and stupid that is?
These people...

41:25.951 --> 41:27.252
I can handle myself.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.855
And it's not your concern
or your business.

41:29.888 --> 41:31.056
It's my business

41:31.089 --> 41:33.625
if I think my asset
is in too deep.

41:33.659 --> 41:35.060
You need to chill.
Chill?

41:35.093 --> 41:36.662
Thousands of people
could have died today

41:36.695 --> 41:38.096
because of what we did.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.865
It's a little hard to chill.
