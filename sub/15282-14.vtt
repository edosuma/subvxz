01:05.126 --> 01:07.859
There's usually no acceptable
excuse for violence,

01:07.926 --> 01:11.827
But for you i am making
an exception.

01:11.892 --> 01:13.859
Oh, my god, agent rossi.

01:13.926 --> 01:14.992
This can't be everything.

01:15.059 --> 01:15.992
I'm sorry, sir?

01:16.059 --> 01:17.035
This is not everything.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.026
I was taking a show...
you're coming in.

01:20.093 --> 01:21.487
This is that galen file
i asked you to put together,

01:21.497 --> 01:23.293
That double homicide
in indianapolis?

01:23.360 --> 01:24.992
Uh, no, no, sir,
you didn't ask me

01:25.059 --> 01:26.049
To put anything
together. You ju--

01:26.052 --> 01:27.526
There's more
to this case file.

01:27.593 --> 01:29.693
Um...uh, sir,
can this wait
till the morning?

01:29.760 --> 01:31.193
And where are my notes,
my original crime scene notes?

01:31.259 --> 01:33.460
Again, sir, you didn't
ask for the specifics.

01:33.526 --> 01:34.859
You just told me
to look up an old case.

01:34.926 --> 01:35.916
Do i have to tell you
how to look for everything?

01:36.106 --> 01:37.230
What kind of a researcher
are you?

01:37.642 --> 01:39.375
I'm not a researcher,
i'm a technical analyst.

01:39.441 --> 01:41.575
What the hell
does that even mean?

01:41.642 --> 01:44.441
You left the middle of
my back totally unloofaed.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.441
Ssa rossi.

01:53.508 --> 01:56.375
Agent rossi,
i am aware that

01:56.441 --> 01:57.874
Fraternization
between bureau employees

01:57.941 --> 01:59.208
Is against the rules.
However--

01:59.275 --> 02:02.074
It's the 20th anniversary
of this crime.

02:02.141 --> 02:03.508
20 years tomorrow

02:03.575 --> 02:06.008
3 children woke up
and found their parents
murdered.

02:06.074 --> 02:08.108
Whoever did it
is still out there.

02:08.174 --> 02:11.441
It's time they paid for it.

02:20.008 --> 02:21.275
Ready?

02:21.341 --> 02:22.708
Yeah.

02:22.774 --> 02:23.974
How'd you do tonight?

02:24.041 --> 02:25.108
Tips good?

02:25.174 --> 02:26.739
You knew. If you
have to ask questions

02:26.741 --> 02:28.608
I'd rather walk myself
to my car.

02:29.841 --> 02:31.041
Good luck.

02:31.108 --> 02:33.849
Bitch.

02:33.875 --> 02:36.223
Indianapolis,indiana

02:45.375 --> 02:47.141
Hey, you dance nice.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.041
Yeah, i could tell
you liked it
a whole $2.00 worth.

02:50.108 --> 02:51.807
Yeah, i would have
given you more
if i had it.

02:51.874 --> 02:52.974
I ran out.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.408
Well, you should've left.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.874
Don't i get to look
all i want
for the cover charge?

02:56.941 --> 02:59.340
Yeah, cover charges
include the parking lot.
Looking's over.

02:59.341 --> 03:01.008
Why are you so
pissed off, huh?

03:01.074 --> 03:02.974
You want to see pissed off?

03:03.041 --> 03:04.874
Hey, whoa.

03:04.974 --> 03:06.241
Come on.

03:07.541 --> 03:10.008
I'm just gonna go
back in the club, ok?

03:11.108 --> 03:12.508
Ok.

03:17.874 --> 03:19.408
What do you want?

03:21.675 --> 03:23.575
Freak.

04:42.829 --> 04:43.996
Come on in.

04:44.062 --> 04:45.962
I can't believe he showed up
at my apartment.

04:46.029 --> 04:47.729
It's not like
i'm doing anything here.

04:47.795 --> 04:50.329
We just had a seminar
on fraternization last week.

04:50.396 --> 04:52.296
I really have a lot
of work to do, garcia.

04:52.363 --> 04:54.096
So you don't want to hear

04:54.163 --> 04:56.062
How agent rossi
showed up at my door

04:56.129 --> 04:57.329
In the middle of the night

04:57.396 --> 04:58.762
While i was enjoying
a post-Coital shower

04:58.829 --> 05:02.662
With fellow fbi technical
analyst kevin lynch?

05:02.729 --> 05:03.962
Sit.

05:16.196 --> 05:18.795
What the hell...

05:18.862 --> 05:22.163
So you were in the shower
with kevin lynch?

05:22.229 --> 05:24.229
Come on, jj,
i'm being serious.
I need your help.

05:24.296 --> 05:25.429
With what?

05:25.496 --> 05:26.489
Agent rossi.

05:26.596 --> 05:29.329
We're not supposed to date
fellow bureau employees.

05:29.356 --> 05:31.329
From what i hear,
rossi is the reason

05:31.426 --> 05:32.962
Most of these
fraternization rules

05:33.029 --> 05:34.463
Even exist, ok?

05:34.530 --> 05:35.962
He's not gonna
tell anyone.

05:36.029 --> 05:37.563
Just relax.

05:39.762 --> 05:41.929
Wait--What--
What was rossi doing
in your apartment?

05:41.996 --> 05:44.163
Well, that's a good...

05:46.194 --> 05:47.362
I'm not supposed
to tell anyone.

05:47.363 --> 05:48.562
Why?

05:48.629 --> 05:50.495
I didn't press the issue.

05:50.562 --> 05:51.829
I was all naked

05:51.896 --> 05:53.296
And all drippy.

05:53.363 --> 05:54.996
Right.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.495
Doesn't showering
with someone

05:56.562 --> 05:57.462
Always seem like
a better idea

05:57.529 --> 05:59.796
Before you're
actually doing it?

05:59.862 --> 06:01.363
Yes, it is
a bit of a workout.

06:01.430 --> 06:02.696
I mean,
there comes a point

06:02.762 --> 06:03.996
When a girl's just gotta
wash her hair alone.

06:04.063 --> 06:04.996
You know?

06:06.296 --> 06:08.495
Huh. Well, this is
turning into some morning.

06:08.562 --> 06:10.896
Mrs. Hotchner.

06:12.229 --> 06:14.595
Well, that--
That would make sense

06:14.662 --> 06:16.296
Because he's in a prison
right now.

06:16.363 --> 06:18.862
So sometimes cell
service can be...

06:18.929 --> 06:21.963
Oh, yeah--Well,
if--Yeah, if i can
get ahold of him,

06:22.029 --> 06:22.963
I'll...

06:23.029 --> 06:24.063
Ok.

06:25.129 --> 06:27.662
That is one seriously
pissed-Off lady.

06:27.729 --> 06:30.430
She can't get hotch
on his cell phone.

06:30.495 --> 06:31.499
Why would she call you?

06:31.599 --> 06:33.396
Because she knows
i can do this.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.263
Yeah, jj.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.229
Um, no, it's--It's--

06:39.296 --> 06:40.829
It's a personal matter.

06:41.963 --> 06:43.227
Yes, thank you.

06:43.297 --> 06:45.896
I will take care of it
when i get back.

06:45.963 --> 06:46.963
Is everything all right?

06:47.029 --> 06:48.229
Yeah, fine.

06:48.296 --> 06:50.063
We can do this
interview another time.

06:50.129 --> 06:52.096
Well, he's scheduled
to be executed next week.

06:52.163 --> 06:53.662
I can take the lead
if you--

06:53.729 --> 06:54.829
Reid.

06:57.824 --> 06:58.757
Agent hotchner?

06:58.824 --> 06:59.791
Yes.

06:59.857 --> 07:00.958
Ah.

07:01.024 --> 07:02.235
You must be dr. Reid.

07:02.265 --> 07:04.458
Abner merriman,
assistant warden.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.625
You're here to see our
infamous inmate hardwick.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.458
Yeah. He agreed
to meet with us

07:08.525 --> 07:11.252
As part of our criminal
personality research project
prior to his execution.

07:11.486 --> 07:14.286
I've read some of your
studies in police journals.

07:14.353 --> 07:16.753
Serial killers are
a kind of hobby of mine.

07:16.820 --> 07:19.087
Chester's the only one
i've ever met in person,
though.

07:19.154 --> 07:20.687
I bet
you've met quite a few.

07:20.753 --> 07:22.120
Sir, we'd very much
like to get started

07:22.186 --> 07:23.420
As soon as we can.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.186
Oh, of course, of course.
Forgive me.

07:25.253 --> 07:27.253
Um, we, uh...

07:27.319 --> 07:30.987
We don't really have
interrogation facilities,

07:31.054 --> 07:32.920
But i do have a small room
that you can use.

07:32.987 --> 07:34.120
You're not armed?

07:34.186 --> 07:35.653
We secured our weapons
before we arrived.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.353
It's not our first time
in a prison.

07:37.420 --> 07:41.154
No, no,
i suppose that's true.

07:41.219 --> 07:44.586
I have to say, when i heard
that he contacted you,

07:44.653 --> 07:45.653
I was surprised.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.653
Why?

07:46.720 --> 07:48.453
Chester hardwick?

07:48.520 --> 07:51.787
He doesn't really talk much.

07:51.853 --> 07:53.186
To anyone.

07:53.253 --> 07:55.753
Well, that usually changes
when someone's about to die.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.386
No...

07:59.453 --> 08:01.020
Mommy...

08:01.087 --> 08:02.020
It's morning.

08:02.087 --> 08:03.787
Connie.

08:03.853 --> 08:05.653
Connie.

08:05.720 --> 08:06.753
No!
Connie!

08:06.820 --> 08:08.653
Connie...chill.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.286
It's the brother.
It's georgie.

08:10.353 --> 08:11.420
What?

08:11.486 --> 08:13.353
You were dreaming again.

08:13.420 --> 08:15.386
I'm sorry.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.386
You never have to apologize
to me for the dream.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.054
What time is it?

08:20.054 --> 08:21.154
9:30.

08:21.219 --> 08:23.054
You're late for work.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.420
Yeah, uh, about that, uh...

08:26.486 --> 08:28.486
I sort of punched a guy.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.687
Did you get fired?

08:33.352 --> 08:34.852
Yeah. 53 bucks.
You're, like,

08:34.919 --> 08:36.653
The worst stripper
in the world.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.318
Well, to get more
i gotta show more.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.385
And topless is bad enough.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.986
Well, why don't you
just quit if it
bugs you that much?

08:44.054 --> 08:45.953
'Cause we gotta eat.

08:46.020 --> 08:49.020
Yeah, well, we need
some stuff, by the way.

08:49.087 --> 08:50.753
So go get it.

08:52.797 --> 08:54.598
Where's alicia?

08:54.665 --> 08:56.238
Left last night
with some dude.

08:56.674 --> 08:57.659
What dude?

08:57.660 --> 08:59.360
I don't know.
Some dude in a jeep.

09:01.226 --> 09:03.560
Got your yearly gift,
i see.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.326
They left it in my car
this time.

09:06.393 --> 09:09.326
They left this for me
on the porch, too.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.260
Son of a bitch is never
gonna leave us alone.

09:13.326 --> 09:17.193
Happy 20th
anniversary, right?

09:20.960 --> 09:22.527
I hate you.

09:29.161 --> 09:31.427
The, uh, door will of course
be locked from the outside,

09:31.493 --> 09:32.593
And this button here,

09:32.660 --> 09:34.427
It sounds audibly
as well as triggers

09:34.493 --> 09:36.193
A flashing light
to signal the guards

09:36.260 --> 09:37.760
Thank you.
When you're finished.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.260
Are these
the crime scene photos?

09:39.326 --> 09:40.860
Oh.
Uh, some of them, yes.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.427
God...

09:47.493 --> 09:48.960
I knew what he did,
of course,

09:49.027 --> 09:50.794
But i...

09:50.860 --> 09:52.161
You know, never saw...

09:52.226 --> 09:54.927
23 victims like this.

09:54.994 --> 09:58.094
Sometimes in these interviews
they talk about crimes
they were never charged with,

09:58.161 --> 09:59.393
So it might even be more.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.660
Is it ever less?
No.

10:01.727 --> 10:02.827
Uh, please.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.161
Paying attention
to these items

10:04.226 --> 10:05.960
Projects a kind of
importance on them.

10:06.027 --> 10:08.161
When he comes in,
i'd like to give him
the opportunity

10:08.226 --> 10:11.061
To show us which parts
of the crimes he thinks
are important.

10:11.127 --> 10:13.326
Sorry. Of course. Sorry.
It's all right.

10:21.527 --> 10:23.994
Chains left on, right?

10:24.061 --> 10:25.326
That's probably
a good idea.

10:25.393 --> 10:27.161
No. It won't be necessary.

10:27.226 --> 10:28.161
It won't?

10:28.226 --> 10:29.493
Mm-Hmm.
You sure?

10:29.560 --> 10:30.994
We're just gonna talk,
right, chester?

10:36.960 --> 10:38.994
Hotch is in connecticut,
right?

10:39.061 --> 10:40.660
With reid.
They left last night.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.293
They're doing
a custodial interview.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.161
Chester hardwick.
Oh, damn.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.994
He doesn't need anything
else on his mind

10:46.061 --> 10:47.293
When he's dealing with
a guy like hardwick.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.760
So what do we do?

10:48.827 --> 10:50.794
You got any idea
what rossi was working on?

10:50.860 --> 10:53.226
I--I think garcia
might know.

10:53.293 --> 10:54.860
He stopped by her place
last night.

10:54.927 --> 10:55.994
What?

10:56.061 --> 10:57.161
Why?

10:57.226 --> 11:00.061
I'm not
supposed to say.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.660
'Cause...

11:01.727 --> 11:03.860
He said he wanted
to keep it between us.

11:03.927 --> 11:05.161
He might need our help.

11:05.226 --> 11:07.127
He didn't ask anyone
for help.

11:07.193 --> 11:08.226
Penelope...

11:08.293 --> 11:09.727
Rossi is a guy

11:09.794 --> 11:11.960
Who color codes
his handwritten notes

11:12.027 --> 11:13.161
In his notebooks.

11:13.226 --> 11:15.193
Blue pen for
evidentiary items,

11:15.260 --> 11:17.660
Red pen for supposition
and theory.

11:17.727 --> 11:21.527
The guy is a fussy,
anal-Retentive neat freak

11:21.593 --> 11:23.493
Who never leaves anything
out of its place.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.493
I would say this
is a scream for help.

11:28.727 --> 11:30.161
He's in indianapolis,

11:30.226 --> 11:32.260
On a 20-Year-Old
double homicide.

11:32.326 --> 11:34.161
He said it's time
someone pays for it.

11:34.226 --> 11:36.660
And he was upset.

11:36.727 --> 11:38.193
Indianapolis?

11:38.260 --> 11:39.694
Yeah. He took a commercial
flight this morning,

11:39.760 --> 11:41.193
He picked up a bureau suv
half an hour ago.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.326
Jet's available.

11:42.393 --> 11:44.493
Let's go.

11:49.894 --> 11:51.226
Agent rossi.

11:52.694 --> 11:55.527
Gary willis, indianapolis
police department.

11:55.593 --> 11:57.193
I asked for
captain giles.

11:57.260 --> 11:59.027
Yeah, he died a year ago.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.460
That's a shame.

12:00.527 --> 12:02.127
He was a good cop.

12:02.193 --> 12:03.460
Do you have
the galen files?

12:03.527 --> 12:04.527
Yeah, they're right here.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.293
Do you have
anything new?

12:06.360 --> 12:07.860
If we do,
it's not in this file.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.627
You don't know?

12:09.694 --> 12:11.493
Well, who's working
on this?

12:11.560 --> 12:13.760
20 years
is a long time cold.

12:13.827 --> 12:16.994
When do you stop looking
for a double murderer?

12:17.061 --> 12:19.527
You know, i didn't know
this was an fbi case.

12:19.593 --> 12:20.960
Well, it isn't.
Not officially.

12:21.027 --> 12:23.827
I was on the original scene
the day it happened.

12:23.894 --> 12:25.627
You probably know more
about it than i do, then.

12:25.694 --> 12:27.094
At least you had
someone to talk to.

12:27.161 --> 12:28.794
No one's lived here
since that day.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.794
There's a housekeeping
service that comes in

12:30.860 --> 12:32.860
Once a week,
but otherwise it's empty.

12:32.927 --> 12:37.102
I know.I own it

12:41.995 --> 12:43.481
I bought it at an auction

12:43.491 --> 12:44.759
2 years after the murders.

12:45.109 --> 12:45.594
Why?

12:45.595 --> 12:46.896
The money went
to the grandmother.

12:46.962 --> 12:48.929
She raised them after...

12:48.996 --> 12:51.462
Well, she died
some years later and...

12:51.528 --> 12:53.595
They're still living
over there at her house.

12:53.662 --> 12:55.062
That's pretty personally
involved.

12:55.129 --> 12:57.629
Do you know these people
or something?

12:58.947 --> 13:00.124
No.

13:01.797 --> 13:05.141
It was the kids,
i guess. I...

13:05.142 --> 13:06.727
Kind of got attached.

13:07.473 --> 13:09.239
Look, i don't mean
to be a hard-Ass.

13:09.306 --> 13:11.406
It's no problem.

13:11.473 --> 13:13.705
We going in?

13:13.772 --> 13:15.906
No.

13:15.972 --> 13:17.972
I've spent years
looking in that house.

13:18.039 --> 13:19.839
There's nothing there,
nothing we missed,

13:19.906 --> 13:21.772
No evidence we didn't find.

13:21.839 --> 13:22.839
Then why are you here?

13:22.906 --> 13:25.506
I was hoping
you had something new.

13:27.572 --> 13:29.006
I'm sorry to bother you.

13:29.073 --> 13:31.139
No bother.

13:31.206 --> 13:33.739
Thanks for coming.

13:37.906 --> 13:40.972
Sit down.

13:41.039 --> 13:43.406
I'd like
this window opened.

13:45.006 --> 13:46.506
I'll answer
any question you have,

13:46.572 --> 13:49.306
But only if this window
is open.

13:49.373 --> 13:50.739
Go ahead.

13:50.806 --> 13:52.039
Reid.

13:53.306 --> 13:56.785
You were born april 4, 1950?

13:56.809 --> 13:59.137
Does my birthdate
really matter?

13:59.157 --> 14:01.672
It's customary for us
to start at the beginning.

14:01.739 --> 14:04.506
We want to try to know
as much as we can
about your childhood.

14:04.572 --> 14:06.540
There's nothing to know.
It was average.

14:06.605 --> 14:09.939
I lived in a nice house
on a quiet street.

14:10.006 --> 14:12.772
I ate cereal.
I went to school.
I watched cartoons.

14:12.839 --> 14:14.506
I don't have time
for this.

14:14.572 --> 14:17.239
You didn't live
in a nice house
on a quiet street.

14:17.306 --> 14:18.772
You grew up
in a series of projects

14:18.839 --> 14:21.639
In east bridgeport,
each one worse than the last.

14:21.705 --> 14:23.073
You spent your teenage years

14:23.139 --> 14:24.772
Peeping into your female
neighbors' windows

14:24.839 --> 14:27.806
And burglarizing
their underwear drawers
when you got the chance.

14:27.872 --> 14:29.440
And you set 100 small fires

14:29.506 --> 14:31.972
For which you spent 2 years
in juvenile detention.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.506
We've done extensive
research, mr. Hardwick,

14:34.572 --> 14:37.173
And we've talked to almost
everyone you've ever known...

14:37.239 --> 14:38.739
Including your mother.

14:39.739 --> 14:41.139
Good old jean?

14:41.206 --> 14:44.339
I'll bet she was
a real treat.

14:44.406 --> 14:46.672
Good old jean's
down the street
in the state hospital.

14:46.739 --> 14:49.373
At this point,
lying to us

14:49.440 --> 14:50.540
Isn't really possible

14:50.605 --> 14:51.806
Or helpful.

14:51.872 --> 14:53.806
Well, then, you're wrong.

14:53.872 --> 14:54.872
About what?

14:57.139 --> 15:01.306
I started a lot more
than 100 fires.

15:17.572 --> 15:18.906
Oh, my--!
Beautiful.

15:18.972 --> 15:20.073
Aah!

15:21.473 --> 15:23.073
I'm...s-Sorry.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.906
I didn't mean to scare you.

15:24.972 --> 15:26.540
I just, uh,

15:26.605 --> 15:30.239
I--You just look
so beautiful multitasking.

15:30.306 --> 15:31.572
What are you doing here?

15:31.639 --> 15:33.073
I work here, too.

15:33.139 --> 15:34.440
Yeah, in your own office,

15:34.506 --> 15:35.540
2 floors down.

15:35.605 --> 15:37.672
I can't come over
and visit?

15:37.739 --> 15:40.872
Are you insane?!

15:40.939 --> 15:41.972
What's wrong?

15:42.039 --> 15:44.039
Have you forgotten
last night?

15:45.173 --> 15:48.440
I will never forget
last night.

15:48.506 --> 15:50.806
We were caught fraternizing
by one of my bosses.

15:50.872 --> 15:52.139
You know--Ahem--

15:52.206 --> 15:54.739
It was rude of rossi
to show up at your place

15:54.806 --> 15:55.739
After work hours.

15:55.806 --> 15:57.139
Rude? You found him rude?

15:57.206 --> 16:00.406
You know, maybe i should
have a talk with him.

16:00.473 --> 16:01.572
Straighten him out.

16:01.639 --> 16:03.306
You want to straighten out
agent rossi?

16:03.373 --> 16:07.239
No, what i want is
for me to be able
to come up here and...

16:07.306 --> 16:08.772
And kiss my girlfriend.

16:08.839 --> 16:11.073
And--And if that means
i have to talk to him,

16:11.139 --> 16:13.406
Well, then--Then that's
what i'll do.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.906
Girlfriend?

16:17.806 --> 16:18.872
Kevin...

16:21.639 --> 16:22.739
Yes?

16:22.806 --> 16:24.572
If you get, like,
within 100 feet

16:24.639 --> 16:26.039
Of agent rossi,
i will unleash

16:26.106 --> 16:28.739
An unrecoverable virus
on your personal
computer systems

16:28.806 --> 16:30.939
That will reduce
your electronic world

16:31.006 --> 16:33.073
Into something between
a commodore 64

16:33.139 --> 16:35.306
And a block
of government cheese.

16:37.373 --> 16:38.672
Call me later.

16:40.039 --> 16:41.772
You know,
there's not really much

16:41.839 --> 16:43.006
To this file, garcia.

16:43.073 --> 16:44.839
Oh, there's a latent
fingerprint

16:44.906 --> 16:47.605
That's making a second run
through aphis as we speak.

16:47.672 --> 16:49.206
As soon as i get results
i'll let you know.

16:49.273 --> 16:52.339
And then there's also
apparently some
crime scene notes.

16:52.406 --> 16:54.373
That agent rossi wrote up
that i'm still spelunking for.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.705
So he was on
the actual crime scene
with the local detectives?

16:57.772 --> 16:59.605
Could be why
it bothers him so much.

16:59.672 --> 17:01.540
Well, i highly doubt
this was
his first scene.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.672
Yeah, but it was a bad one.

17:03.739 --> 17:05.638
The weapon was
a long-Handled ax.

17:05.704 --> 17:08.006
Yeah, but we've seen worse
since he's been back.

17:08.073 --> 17:10.791
There's nothing else
cross-Referenced,

17:10.801 --> 17:12.406
No other crimes
tied to this?

17:12.473 --> 17:14.239
No, nothing i can find.
I mean, certainly nothing

17:14.306 --> 17:15.605
With these signature
elements.

17:15.672 --> 17:18.138
Ok, so it's a double
homicide, yes,

17:18.205 --> 17:20.839
But a single occurrence
with no apparent issue
of state lines?

17:20.906 --> 17:24.073
Was there a request
from the local authorities
for the fbi's help?

17:24.138 --> 17:25.205
I don't think so.

17:25.272 --> 17:27.473
So then why is this
a b.A.U. Case?

17:27.540 --> 17:28.872
I don't think it was.

17:28.939 --> 17:30.839
All right, garcia,
i want you to double-Check

17:30.906 --> 17:32.373
Any other unsolved
murders in indiana

17:32.440 --> 17:34.006
Or the surrounding states
near this time.

17:34.073 --> 17:35.972
Something this brutal
doesn't feel like
a one-Time thing.

17:36.039 --> 17:38.073
You've got it.

17:38.139 --> 17:39.373
What is it?

17:39.440 --> 17:42.440
What is it about
this case for him?

17:44.006 --> 17:46.772
What do you want to hear?

17:46.839 --> 17:50.939
How papa kicked me
and jean's ass
every single day?

17:51.006 --> 17:53.106
That the kind of thing
you want to hear?

17:53.173 --> 17:53.980
If it's true.

17:54.139 --> 17:57.506
Nobody gives a damn
about the truth.

18:04.906 --> 18:05.939
Agent rossi?

18:06.006 --> 18:07.605
Anything come back yet
on that print?

18:07.672 --> 18:09.273
No. No matches.
Nothing on file. Sorry.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.039
What about my notes?

18:11.106 --> 18:13.239
Those i have.
Do you have a pda?

18:13.306 --> 18:13.981
'Cause i can e-Mail them
to you.

18:14.239 --> 18:15.572
What's a pda?

18:15.639 --> 18:17.306
It's a personal digital--

18:17.373 --> 18:19.739
Never mind. Is there a fax
number where you're at?

18:19.806 --> 18:21.073
I'm at the palmer hotel.

18:21.139 --> 18:22.906
I'll be back there later.
I don't have the number.

18:22.972 --> 18:23.906
Ok. I will find it.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.139
Thanks.

18:25.206 --> 18:27.239
All right, i'll check back
with you in, oh...

18:27.306 --> 18:29.473
And, sir, there's something
else that you should know.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.206
Agents prentiss and morgan

18:31.273 --> 18:33.073
Found your office
in disarray

18:33.139 --> 18:34.073
This morning.

18:34.139 --> 18:35.139
So?

18:35.206 --> 18:38.239
Well...they're concerned
about you.

18:38.306 --> 18:39.572
Well, tell them
not to be.

18:39.639 --> 18:41.273
Yeah, uh, sir,
that's the thing,

18:41.339 --> 18:42.440
See? I'm sorry--

18:42.506 --> 18:44.473
You told them
about this case?

18:44.540 --> 18:46.273
Yeah, i'm...
we're all worried about you.

18:46.339 --> 18:48.906
Damn it, i asked you
to keep this between us.

18:48.972 --> 18:50.473
I'm sorry, sir.

18:50.540 --> 18:53.473
I know, and i...

18:53.540 --> 18:55.806
They're going to see you.

18:55.872 --> 18:57.373
They're coming here?

18:57.440 --> 18:59.739
I don't need
anybody's damn help.

19:01.739 --> 19:03.672
Temperature's dropping.

19:03.739 --> 19:06.540
It's that time of year.

19:06.605 --> 19:09.605
Warm days, cold nights.

19:09.672 --> 19:10.639
It'll be summer soon.

19:10.705 --> 19:12.739
But not for you.

19:12.806 --> 19:14.540
No...

19:14.605 --> 19:16.672
Not for me.

19:16.739 --> 19:17.972
Let's, um,

19:18.039 --> 19:20.572
Let's talk about
the specifics of the case.

19:20.639 --> 19:22.839
Why did you choose
sheila o'neal?

19:22.906 --> 19:25.206
You gotta show me a picture.
I don't know their names.

19:25.273 --> 19:26.872
Is that what
this is all about,

19:26.939 --> 19:28.506
Some chance
to relive all of this?

19:28.572 --> 19:31.139
I have an excellent memory.

19:31.206 --> 19:34.039
I thought you wanted
to hear the truth.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.139
Truth is, they meant
nothing to me.

19:36.206 --> 19:38.273
They were toys, a diversion,

19:38.339 --> 19:42.306
And from the moment
i decided to kill them,
they were dead.

19:42.373 --> 19:44.273
They begged, they cried,

19:44.339 --> 19:46.639
They bargained,
and it didn't matter,

19:46.705 --> 19:49.206
Because they  didn't matter.

19:49.273 --> 19:51.906
Sometimes i wish
i  was  normal,

19:51.972 --> 19:54.906
That i'd had
a regular life.

19:54.972 --> 19:56.906
But i didn't.

19:56.972 --> 19:58.572
Why did you ask us here?

20:01.273 --> 20:02.872
I wanted to smell the air.

20:02.939 --> 20:04.806
What?

20:04.872 --> 20:06.872
They've got me on death watch.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.939
24-Hour-A-Day isolation,

20:10.006 --> 20:12.738
And i will be
until they take me
to the death chamber.

20:12.838 --> 20:15.906
So i wanted to smell the air

20:15.972 --> 20:18.039
One last time

20:18.106 --> 20:19.540
Before i die.

20:19.605 --> 20:20.806
Thank you
for giving me that.

20:20.872 --> 20:22.073
Let's pack it up.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.239
Should we at least--

20:23.306 --> 20:24.306
No, no.

20:27.605 --> 20:28.639
Have a nice trip, chester.

20:30.273 --> 20:33.739
You're going
where you belong.

20:36.373 --> 20:38.705
It's 5:17.

20:39.705 --> 20:42.772
Evening yard
started at 5:00.

20:43.939 --> 20:47.039
Guard staff's outside
with the population.

20:47.106 --> 20:51.406
There won't be anyone
to open that door for...

20:51.473 --> 20:53.772
At least 13 minutes.

21:01.269 --> 21:04.485
And they took?????

21:12.939 --> 21:14.639
While you were doing
your research,

21:14.706 --> 21:17.639
Maybe a question or two
about security tones

21:17.706 --> 21:18.840
Would have been a good idea.

21:18.905 --> 21:20.639
I heard the tones.

21:20.706 --> 21:22.939
So you planned to be
locked inside with me,

21:23.005 --> 21:25.806
With no guns or weapons.

21:25.872 --> 21:27.339
I won't need a gun.

21:28.673 --> 21:31.939
There's no way they're
gonna execute me next week,

21:32.005 --> 21:34.939
Not after i kill
2 fbi agents.

21:35.005 --> 21:37.172
You saved my life
by coming here.

21:37.239 --> 21:38.373
But unfortunately for you,

21:38.439 --> 21:41.272
I'm not a 5-Foot-Tall,
100-Pound girl.

21:42.573 --> 21:44.673
All your life

21:44.740 --> 21:46.773
You've gone after victims
who couldn't fight back.

21:46.840 --> 21:50.206
And the rest of the time
you spent looking
over your shoulder,

21:50.272 --> 21:53.106
Worried about
the knock on the door,

21:53.172 --> 21:54.872
Scared that somebody like me
would be on the other side

21:54.939 --> 21:56.272
Waiting to put you away.

21:56.339 --> 21:58.539
At your core,
you're a coward.

22:00.005 --> 22:02.172
Chester, do you want to know
why you killed those women?

22:05.239 --> 22:06.606
What?

22:06.673 --> 22:08.373
Earlier you said you wish
that you were different.

22:08.439 --> 22:10.506
I can tell you
why you killed them,

22:10.573 --> 22:11.905
Why you are...what you are.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.972
You're buyin',
i'm drinkin'.

22:22.039 --> 22:24.139
I don't think any of us
could afford this place
otherwise.

22:24.206 --> 22:25.806
Yeah, i know i can't.

22:25.872 --> 22:27.639
Go home.

22:27.706 --> 22:30.172
We thought you might
need some help.

22:30.239 --> 22:31.639
You're wrong.

22:31.706 --> 22:33.172
Come on, now, rossi.

22:33.239 --> 22:34.740
Bounce some theories
off us.

22:34.806 --> 22:36.272
Fresh eyes can't hurt.

22:36.339 --> 22:38.740
This isn't even
a b.A.U. Case.

22:38.806 --> 22:42.606
Maybe not yet,
but i can make anything
a b.A.U. Case if i want to.

22:42.673 --> 22:45.439
It's about paperwork
and i know the paperwork.

22:48.339 --> 22:49.740
Why do you care?

22:52.139 --> 22:53.840
Because you do.

22:57.005 --> 23:00.206
You can tell me why
i did the things i did?

23:00.272 --> 23:01.573
I think so.

23:01.639 --> 23:02.738
I do.

23:04.343 --> 23:06.336
Your mother's bipolar

23:06.436 --> 23:09.406
And almost certainly
an undifferentiated
schizophrenic.

23:09.473 --> 23:12.606
Your father suffered
severe shell shock in the war,

23:12.673 --> 23:14.905
What we now refer to
as post-Traumatic
stress disorder.

23:14.972 --> 23:17.639
As far as i can tell,
he remained clinically
depressed the rest of his life.

23:17.706 --> 23:20.939
53% of all serial killers have
some form of mental illness
in their family.

23:21.005 --> 23:22.473
In your case,
both your parents

23:22.539 --> 23:24.306
Suffered psychological
disorders,

23:24.373 --> 23:25.673
Which they largely
took out on...

23:25.740 --> 23:27.905
They beat each other
as much as they beat you,

23:27.972 --> 23:30.740
So violence became
a natural expression
of love...

23:30.806 --> 23:33.639
There's something called
the hypothalamic region
of the limbic system.

23:33.706 --> 23:35.139
It's the most primitive
part of the brain.

23:35.206 --> 23:36.306
It wants what it wants

23:36.373 --> 23:38.206
Without conscience
and without judgment.

23:38.272 --> 23:40.706
It's what makes babies cry
when they're hungry, uh,

23:40.773 --> 23:43.206
Scream when they want
affection, become enraged

23:43.272 --> 23:44.740
When a toy is taken away.

23:44.806 --> 23:47.573
In most children,
a healthy relationship
with their mother

23:47.639 --> 23:50.272
Counters the hypothalamus
and maps the child's brain

23:50.339 --> 23:51.939
Into healthy emotional
response...

23:52.005 --> 23:53.972
Your hypothalamus
never learned control.

23:54.039 --> 23:55.740
It still operates
on that primitive level...

23:55.806 --> 23:58.106
Your records indicate
that you display the symptoms
of satyriasis.

23:58.172 --> 23:59.439
You're obsessed with sex.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.773
Sex and love
are cross-Wired with pain.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.106
Additionally,
your hypothalamus
won't allow you

24:04.172 --> 24:07.106
To stop seeking the--
The desires that it wants.

24:07.172 --> 24:08.606
So you became
a sexual sadist...

24:08.673 --> 24:10.606
No functioninig sexual partner
will ever willingly submit

24:10.673 --> 24:12.272
To the painful desires
that you have.

24:12.339 --> 24:13.939
The only way
you can serve them

24:14.005 --> 24:15.439
Is by making a partner
compliant,

24:15.506 --> 24:17.573
Making sure that they do
exactly what you
want them to do.

24:17.639 --> 24:19.806
And you ensure that
by killing them.

24:21.872 --> 24:24.232
Earlier, you said
your victims
never had a chance.

24:26.452 --> 24:30.090
I think you know
deep down...

24:30.539 --> 24:33.706
It was you who really
never had a chance.

24:39.206 --> 24:41.272
Everything all right
in here?

24:41.339 --> 24:42.506
Fine. We're done.

24:46.272 --> 24:48.939
Is that true,
i never had a chance?

24:49.005 --> 24:50.072
I don't know. Maybe.

24:53.506 --> 24:57.272
I was here on a serial
rapist in '88.

24:57.339 --> 24:59.639
It was pretty short work.

24:59.706 --> 25:02.606
The guy wasn't gonna win
any i.Q. Contests.

25:02.673 --> 25:06.939
The day after, we, uh,
collared him,

25:07.005 --> 25:09.606
A local detective
was driving me
to the airport,

25:09.673 --> 25:12.439
And, uh, he hears
a call on the walkie

25:12.506 --> 25:15.106
Of kids screaming
in a house

25:15.172 --> 25:17.439
Not far from where we were.

25:17.506 --> 25:21.039
He asks if i mind
taking the job in with him.

25:21.106 --> 25:24.172
We were first on the scene.

25:24.239 --> 25:26.272
Inside we found...

25:26.339 --> 25:28.339
Found this.

25:32.306 --> 25:34.239
The ax had been left behind,

25:34.306 --> 25:36.539
But it had been wiped clean.

25:36.606 --> 25:40.039
It turns out it belonged
to the family.

25:40.106 --> 25:43.406
The, uh, oldest daughter,
connie,

25:43.473 --> 25:45.905
Told me her father...

25:45.972 --> 25:49.239
Bought it on christmas eve
a few months earlier...

25:49.306 --> 25:52.905
To cut down
the christmas tree.

25:54.706 --> 25:57.905
Now i, uh, always
associate the whole thing

25:57.972 --> 26:00.106
With christmas.

26:00.172 --> 26:05.206
Never been able to put
a tree up myself again.

26:05.272 --> 26:08.306
So, he--He never hurt
the kids at all?

26:08.373 --> 26:10.439
Not physically.

26:10.506 --> 26:13.072
But he would have known
that the kids
were in the house.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.439
He only hurt the parents
and then left.

26:15.506 --> 26:18.439
Ok, so, using a weapon
he found at the scene

26:18.506 --> 26:21.439
And not eliminating all
of the potential witnesses,
that makes him disorganized.

26:21.506 --> 26:24.740
But he left no evidence,
which suggests
he's organized.

26:24.806 --> 26:27.072
There was a fingerprint.

26:27.139 --> 26:29.005
But it was behind
the bedroom door.

26:29.072 --> 26:31.239
I don't even think
he knew it was there.

26:31.306 --> 26:34.272
There should have been prints
in other places,

26:34.339 --> 26:36.139
But they were wiped clean.

26:36.206 --> 26:38.239
An open back door,

26:38.306 --> 26:40.972
A--A drinking glass
left in the kitchen.

26:42.773 --> 26:46.740
And that one good print...

26:46.806 --> 26:49.106
Was not a match anywhere.

26:49.971 --> 26:51.972
I've been over this
a million times.

26:52.039 --> 26:53.740
I--I keep thinking,

26:53.806 --> 26:57.406
If there was just
one more piece,

26:57.473 --> 26:59.606
One more thing to go on.

26:59.673 --> 27:02.206
The answer
was right in front of me.

27:02.272 --> 27:03.606
He might be dead.

27:03.673 --> 27:05.573
I have to be sure.

27:05.639 --> 27:08.506
Rossi, if he's dead,
you may never really know.

27:12.939 --> 27:15.939
When we arrived
on the scene...

27:16.005 --> 27:19.139
Before any of the other
units got there...

27:21.339 --> 27:24.106
I could hear them...

27:24.172 --> 27:27.272
Before i even got out
of the car.

27:27.339 --> 27:30.506
It was a warm morning,
and the, uh...

27:30.573 --> 27:34.573
The windows were open
in the upstairs bedroom.

27:36.172 --> 27:39.606
And their voices...

27:39.673 --> 27:42.039
Floated out into the street.

27:45.072 --> 27:47.840
They were crying

27:47.905 --> 27:52.339
And calling for
their mommy and daddy.

27:52.406 --> 27:56.539
3 terrified children
screaming for their
murdered parents.

28:03.139 --> 28:06.740
I've seen so much death
and pain.

28:06.806 --> 28:09.039
But that sound...

28:10.639 --> 28:13.972
It's been 20 years

28:14.039 --> 28:17.972
And i can still hear them
screaming every night...

28:19.172 --> 28:21.072
Crying.

28:25.172 --> 28:27.606
If i can't tell them
for sure

28:27.673 --> 28:32.439
That whoever's responsible
will never do it again...

28:32.506 --> 28:36.072
That screaming
might never stop.

28:55.139 --> 28:57.373
Alicia! Let's go!

28:57.439 --> 28:58.373
In a minute.

28:58.439 --> 29:00.139
Now, leesh!

29:00.206 --> 29:01.406
God!

29:01.473 --> 29:04.773
Guess what--
My sister's a bitch.

29:10.106 --> 29:11.039
Call me.

29:11.106 --> 29:12.239
You didn't give me
your number.

29:12.306 --> 29:13.406
Why do you have to be
like that?

29:13.473 --> 29:14.639
Where were you
for 2 days?

29:14.706 --> 29:16.172
It was only one whole day.

29:16.239 --> 29:17.172
Where were you?

29:17.239 --> 29:18.606
I'm 23 years old, connie.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.740
You should've called.

29:19.806 --> 29:20.939
You're not my mother.

29:37.506 --> 29:39.206
Hi, connie.

29:39.272 --> 29:40.639
I brought the team--

29:40.706 --> 29:42.306
You need to stop this.

29:42.373 --> 29:44.373
Excuse me?

29:44.439 --> 29:47.573
We thought that if
we didn't call you back
the last couple times

29:47.639 --> 29:49.939
You would just give up
and leave us alone.

29:50.005 --> 29:51.905
Well, i know
that it hurts,

29:51.972 --> 29:53.939
But i'm only
trying to make sure

29:54.005 --> 29:56.473
Someone pays for
your parents' deaths.

29:56.539 --> 29:58.005
We don't care anymore.

29:58.072 --> 29:59.473
It's been 20 years.

29:59.539 --> 30:02.639
We need to be able
to move past it.

30:04.473 --> 30:06.039
Please!

30:07.239 --> 30:10.639
I won't bother
you kids again.

30:10.706 --> 30:13.406
And you'll stop it
with the gifts, too?

30:14.439 --> 30:15.639
Gifts?

30:15.706 --> 30:16.840
What are we supposed to do

30:16.905 --> 30:18.506
With a bunch of toys?

30:18.573 --> 30:20.840
They remind us of
the worst day of our lives.

30:23.078 --> 30:25.497
I never send you any gifts

30:39.084 --> 30:40.184
This is it?

30:40.251 --> 30:41.517
It's all we could find.

30:41.584 --> 30:42.851
We threw a lot of them away.

30:42.917 --> 30:44.647
I wish you would have
told me about this.

30:44.747 --> 30:46.485
We thought you
were sending them.

30:46.550 --> 30:48.751
First we kind of liked it,

30:48.817 --> 30:50.751
And then it just became
a bad reminder.

30:51.245 --> 30:53.984
These are incredibly
cheap, aren't they?

30:54.051 --> 30:56.784
Where would you even
buy toys like that?

30:56.851 --> 30:57.817
Or why?

30:57.884 --> 30:58.993
How did you
receive them?

30:59.326 --> 31:01.736
They were usually left
on the front porch at night.

31:02.056 --> 31:04.084
Mine was found
in my car this time.

31:04.151 --> 31:05.717
So he's following you.

31:05.784 --> 31:09.318
There was a pickup
outside the--

31:09.385 --> 31:12.051
Uh, where i work.

31:12.118 --> 31:16.284
I just...
i always thought it was you.

31:16.351 --> 31:17.917
What do you remember
about the pickup?

31:17.984 --> 31:21.751
Uh, all i saw was the shape
and the headlights.

31:21.817 --> 31:25.517
Morgan, obsessional crimes
are your specialty.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.584
Well, there's two kinds
of obsessional offenders

31:27.650 --> 31:29.184
That would send gifts
to survivors.

31:29.251 --> 31:32.118
Sadists who want
to make the families
keep reliving the crime,

31:32.184 --> 31:33.717
Or guilt-Laden offenders,

31:33.784 --> 31:36.418
Desperately trying
to find some type of way
to apologize.

31:36.485 --> 31:38.018
Sadists
usually use something

31:38.084 --> 31:41.418
They know will remind
the family of the person
of the crime.

31:41.485 --> 31:42.884
Jewelry, newspaper clippings.

31:42.951 --> 31:44.851
These don't look like
the kind of things
you would send

31:44.917 --> 31:46.684
To inflict pain
on someone.

31:46.751 --> 31:48.584
So, guilt-Laden.

31:48.650 --> 31:52.118
You know, they actually
look like the kind of
thing a child would send.

31:52.184 --> 31:53.884
Ok.Well, it's rare,

31:53.951 --> 31:55.884
But an unsub who feels
this much guilt

31:55.951 --> 31:57.984
Sometimes commits the crime
unintentionally.

31:58.051 --> 31:59.984
They tend to be
developmentally disabled,

32:00.051 --> 32:01.385
Extremely low i.Q. Offenders,

32:01.451 --> 32:03.218
And generally, well,
they're physically large

32:03.284 --> 32:04.485
And they're very strong.

32:04.550 --> 32:06.418
Strong enough to hurt
somebody accidentally.

32:06.485 --> 32:08.240
Like lennie
in  of mice and men

32:08.250 --> 32:08.968
Exactly.

32:08.978 --> 32:10.650
He needed help, then.

32:10.717 --> 32:13.284
There wasn't a fragment of
evidence left at the scene.

32:13.351 --> 32:14.717
That's not low i.Q.

32:14.784 --> 32:16.385
Well, usually
they're assisted
by an older relative,

32:16.451 --> 32:18.184
And it's almost always
a parent.

32:18.251 --> 32:21.418
And this parent rationalizes
that the unsub would never
try to hurt anybody.

32:21.485 --> 32:23.584
See, in a lot of ways,
this type of unsub...

32:23.650 --> 32:25.418
They're sort of...

32:25.485 --> 32:26.984
Overgrown children.

32:27.051 --> 32:29.817
Jj, when you get garcia
on the phone,

32:29.884 --> 32:32.385
Tell her we're not looking
for other homicides here.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.650
Get her to look into
a string of less serious
offenses in this area--

32:34.717 --> 32:36.318
Parks, playgrounds--

32:36.385 --> 32:38.351
Involving children,
but not necessarily children

32:38.418 --> 32:40.084
That have been injured
or abused.

32:40.151 --> 32:41.184
Ok.

32:41.739 --> 32:43.487
See, an unsub like this,

32:43.587 --> 32:46.650
When they seek out children,
they want to play with them.

32:46.717 --> 32:48.018
They don't really
want to hurt them.

32:48.084 --> 32:49.976
But it's their size.

32:49.977 --> 32:50.775
It frightens people.

32:51.350 --> 32:53.984
This could be that piece
you were looking for.

33:00.784 --> 33:02.351
That was smart
to get hardwick
to focus on himself

33:02.418 --> 33:04.517
Long enough for
the guards to come back.

33:04.584 --> 33:07.984
I find that i do
some of my best work
under intense terror.

33:09.451 --> 33:10.917
I'm sorry.

33:10.984 --> 33:12.418
For what?

33:12.485 --> 33:14.584
I antagonized
the situation.

33:14.650 --> 33:15.784
No, you didn't.

33:15.851 --> 33:18.184
Well, i certainly
didn't help.

33:19.284 --> 33:21.584
Ah...i guess
you really didn't help.

33:24.951 --> 33:28.051
So haley wants me
to sign the divorce
papers uncontested

33:28.118 --> 33:31.451
So nobody wastes money
on lawyers.

33:31.517 --> 33:33.650
You don't want to?

33:33.717 --> 33:36.084
What i want
i'm not gonna get.

33:37.784 --> 33:40.184
Ok, crime-Fighters,
i got the information
you were looking for,

33:40.251 --> 33:42.684
But it may lead to more
questions than answers.

33:42.751 --> 33:43.817
Oh, of course.

33:43.884 --> 33:45.684
There are scads
of open petty crimes,

33:45.751 --> 33:47.084
As described,

33:47.151 --> 33:49.851
In the very area
of indiana
in the last 20 years.

33:49.917 --> 33:51.251
But here's the rub--

33:51.318 --> 33:53.351
A large portion of them
only occur

33:53.418 --> 33:54.650
In the last week of march

33:54.717 --> 33:56.751
And the first week
of april every year.

33:56.817 --> 33:59.018
And then it gets weirder,

33:59.084 --> 34:00.385
'Cause the same kind
of crimes

34:00.451 --> 34:02.284
Crop up in springfield,
illinois,

34:02.351 --> 34:04.550
For the next 2 weeks,
and then des moines, iowa,

34:04.617 --> 34:06.084
In the couple of weeks
after that.

34:06.151 --> 34:07.318
So he's traveling.

34:07.385 --> 34:09.318
On a specific
schedule for years?

34:09.385 --> 34:11.018
Maybe he's a salesman?

34:11.083 --> 34:14.217
Who takes
a developmentally disabled
partner on a sales call?

34:17.583 --> 34:19.284
What about a carnival?

34:19.351 --> 34:20.550
Carnival?

34:20.617 --> 34:22.485
We went to a carnival
the day before.

34:22.550 --> 34:25.351
It's the last thing
we did as a family.

34:25.418 --> 34:27.318
Did anything happen?

34:27.385 --> 34:28.485
No.

34:28.550 --> 34:30.284
No, we had to leave early.

34:30.351 --> 34:32.351
There was this clown that...

34:32.418 --> 34:33.784
Made me a balloon animal.

34:33.851 --> 34:35.385
It didn't even look right.

34:35.451 --> 34:38.150
But then he kind of
followed me around.

34:38.217 --> 34:39.851
He didn't really
do anything,

34:39.917 --> 34:42.351
But my mom got afraid,
so we left.

34:42.418 --> 34:43.550
You never told us that.

34:43.617 --> 34:46.150
I didn't even remember it
until now.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.150
Penelope, pull permits.

34:48.217 --> 34:50.051
Find out is this carnival
is still in business.

34:50.118 --> 34:52.717
The study is ready.

35:05.584 --> 35:08.418
You guys look around.
Prentiss, you come with me.

35:16.817 --> 35:20.218
Jeff! Get more tie-Downs
over that ferris hauler!

35:20.284 --> 35:22.385
I don't want to have to slow
down halfway across illinois

35:22.451 --> 35:26.018
Because that moron left
pieces hanging off again!

35:26.084 --> 35:28.118
Idiots!

35:28.184 --> 35:30.418
You look like
you're in charge.

35:31.751 --> 35:33.584
I can't believe people
actually pay good money

35:33.650 --> 35:35.318
To play
these fixed games.

35:35.385 --> 35:36.385
Men.

35:36.451 --> 35:37.650
Excuse me?

35:37.717 --> 35:38.984
It's not people.

35:39.051 --> 35:40.617
It's men.

35:40.684 --> 35:41.951
Is that a fact?

35:42.018 --> 35:43.851
Only a man would waste $50

35:43.917 --> 35:46.784
Trying to win
that $3.00 stuffed animal.

35:46.851 --> 35:48.784
You pulling out
in a hurry?

35:48.851 --> 35:50.351
That's the way
this business works.

35:50.418 --> 35:52.051
Gotta be set up
where the money is.

35:52.118 --> 35:53.550
Right now
that ain't here.

35:53.617 --> 35:56.184
Where you headed to next,
springfield?

35:57.584 --> 36:00.118
We'd like to talk to you
about one of your clowns.

36:03.018 --> 36:04.517
Did you go
to carnivals as a kid?

36:04.584 --> 36:05.751
Oh, yeah, every year.

36:05.817 --> 36:06.751
Yeah, me, too.

36:06.817 --> 36:07.851
First place
i had a drink.

36:07.917 --> 36:08.984
Clown.

36:15.984 --> 36:17.251
Come on.

36:17.318 --> 36:18.485
Clowns?

36:18.550 --> 36:19.951
This ain't a circus.

36:20.018 --> 36:21.385
Clowns are
for the circus.

36:21.451 --> 36:23.951
You don't have any clowns
in your carnival?

36:24.018 --> 36:27.051
How about a guy
who makes balloon animals?

36:27.118 --> 36:28.218
Might.

36:28.284 --> 36:29.218
Might?

36:29.284 --> 36:30.385
At times.

36:30.451 --> 36:31.917
How long's he been with you?

36:31.984 --> 36:33.118
What is this?

36:33.184 --> 36:36.018
This guy would have been
complained about.

36:36.084 --> 36:38.617
Kids are uncomfortable
around him.

36:38.684 --> 36:40.884
You'd have gotten reports
from parents.

36:40.951 --> 36:43.550
I can't remember
every complaint
i get, mister.

36:43.617 --> 36:44.650
It's not mister.

36:44.717 --> 36:47.584
It's agent rossi, fbi.

36:47.650 --> 36:50.385
Now, do you have a son?

36:52.251 --> 36:53.318
A son.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.650
The guy we want to talk to,

36:55.717 --> 36:57.684
He'd have been
a big problem for you.

36:57.751 --> 37:01.251
You'd have gotten rid of him
a long time ago, unless...

37:01.318 --> 37:04.151
It would have been
difficult for him to
hold down a job for long,

37:04.218 --> 37:05.817
Much less 20 years.

37:05.884 --> 37:06.884
20 years?

37:06.951 --> 37:09.351
I really ain't got time
for this.

37:09.418 --> 37:11.184
Make time.

37:20.018 --> 37:21.617
All right.

37:23.084 --> 37:25.485
He didn't mean
to hurt those people.

37:25.550 --> 37:27.984
It was my fault
as much as his.

37:28.051 --> 37:31.851
I got busy with one of
the rides breaking down

37:31.917 --> 37:33.517
And he wandered off.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.492
He just wanted to see
the little girl again.

37:35.944 --> 37:37.650
He liked her.

37:37.717 --> 37:39.284
He wanted to play.

37:41.251 --> 37:43.784
He would never hurt
anyone.

37:43.851 --> 37:46.485
He went into the father's
room by mistake.

37:46.550 --> 37:47.984
He come after him
with an ax

37:48.051 --> 37:49.851
And he hit joey with it.

37:49.917 --> 37:52.184
So he got mad, that's all.

37:52.251 --> 37:54.451
I mean,
that's understandable.

37:54.550 --> 37:56.550
I mean, isn't that
understandable--

37:56.617 --> 37:58.684
He gets hit with an ax
and he gets mad?

37:58.751 --> 38:00.517
He was sorry
as soon as he did it.

38:00.584 --> 38:01.917
He even put them
back in bed.

38:01.984 --> 38:04.218
He just got angry.

38:04.284 --> 38:05.884
And i was too late!

38:05.951 --> 38:07.184
I was too late!

38:07.251 --> 38:09.218
I couldn't save them.

38:10.650 --> 38:12.684
But every year
i take him back

38:12.751 --> 38:15.584
And i make him remember
what he did.

38:15.650 --> 38:17.584
I'd even make him
pick something
from the joints

38:17.650 --> 38:18.817
To give them.

38:18.884 --> 38:20.018
He never forgets.

38:20.084 --> 38:21.018
Never.

38:21.084 --> 38:22.351
I make sure of that.

38:22.418 --> 38:23.817
Never!

38:23.884 --> 38:25.851
Look...

38:25.917 --> 38:27.784
He's a good boy.

38:31.984 --> 38:33.751
Daddy!
Fbi!

38:33.817 --> 38:35.284
Daddy!

38:36.385 --> 38:37.917
Get your ass out
of there right now.

38:37.984 --> 38:39.084
Daddy!

38:39.151 --> 38:40.517
Daddy!

38:40.584 --> 38:42.784
Let's go. Let's go.

38:42.851 --> 38:43.984
Get down! Stay down!

38:44.051 --> 38:45.817
Daddy! Daddy!

38:45.884 --> 38:47.951
Help me, daddy! Help me!

38:48.018 --> 38:49.451
Don't fight, joey!

38:49.517 --> 38:51.418
Stay down!
I need some help.
I need some help.

38:52.517 --> 38:54.051
Stay down! Don't move!

38:54.118 --> 38:55.517
Don't you hurt him.
He won't fight you.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.451
Help me!

38:58.517 --> 39:00.917
What'd i say? Stop it!
Stop it!

39:00.984 --> 39:04.717
Daddy...

39:04.784 --> 39:06.051
Daddy...

39:06.118 --> 39:07.051
Good boy.

39:07.118 --> 39:09.584
He's a really great boy.

39:09.650 --> 39:10.991
Daddy, help me!

39:11.236 --> 39:12.851
Don't fight, joey.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.550
Daddy!

39:16.385 --> 39:18.451
The title
should be delivered

39:18.517 --> 39:19.851
In the next few days.

39:19.917 --> 39:21.951
You're just giving us
a house?

39:22.018 --> 39:23.485
Giving it back.

39:23.550 --> 39:25.418
It's been kept clean
and maintained.

39:25.485 --> 39:27.751
It should sell
for a decent price.

39:27.817 --> 39:29.584
You'll all get
a fresh start.

39:29.650 --> 39:31.817
You don't have to do this.

39:31.884 --> 39:35.418
I think your parents
would have wanted you
to have it.

39:35.485 --> 39:37.984
Thank you.

39:44.485 --> 39:45.851
Thanks, man.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.051
You're welcome.

39:48.118 --> 39:50.118
Um...

39:50.184 --> 39:52.984
These belonged
to your mother.

39:54.184 --> 39:58.051
Your grandmother let me
hold on to them until...

39:58.118 --> 40:00.617
Well...

40:00.684 --> 40:03.251
You should have them
back now.

40:07.385 --> 40:10.851
Well, my team
is waiting for me.

40:12.684 --> 40:14.184
Agent rossi.

40:15.684 --> 40:17.917
I'd like you
to have these.

40:21.817 --> 40:26.084
Is it ok
if i call you sometime...

40:26.151 --> 40:29.218
Just to let you know
how we're doing?

40:29.284 --> 40:32.151
Anytime, kiddo.

40:32.218 --> 40:33.817
Anytime.

40:36.517 --> 40:41.550

41:11.951 --> 41:13.351
Pretty boy.

41:13.418 --> 41:14.951
How was connecticut?

41:15.018 --> 41:16.917
Ultimately uneventful.

41:16.984 --> 41:20.650
Sir, there's somebody
waiting to speak to you
in your office.

41:24.684 --> 41:26.684
Agent rossi.

41:28.018 --> 41:29.917
We need to talk...

41:29.984 --> 41:32.151
About penelope...

41:33.951 --> 41:35.917
Man to man.

41:38.351 --> 41:40.951
Man to man.

41:41.018 --> 41:42.884
What about penelope?

41:42.951 --> 41:44.184
I don't know.

41:44.251 --> 41:46.351
* garcia and kevin *

41:46.418 --> 41:48.385
* sittin' in a tree *

41:48.451 --> 41:50.884
Get outta here.
Are you serious?

41:50.951 --> 41:53.884
Just when i thought
nothing scandalous

41:53.951 --> 41:55.584
Was ever gonna happen
around here.

41:55.650 --> 41:57.051
What? What does that mean?

41:57.118 --> 41:59.084
Didn't you hear jj?

41:59.151 --> 42:01.584
The song meant something?
No, i missed it.

42:01.650 --> 42:03.550
It--It...

42:04.917 --> 42:07.884
You know what?
Never mind.

42:07.951 --> 42:09.817
What?

42:14.751 --> 42:17.385
"There is no formula
for success

42:17.451 --> 42:20.051
"Except perhaps
an unconditional acceptance

42:20.118 --> 42:22.247
Of life and what it brings."

42:23.250 --> 42:25.251
Arthur rubinstein.

42:26.951 --> 42:29.418
* we'll get by,
but we don't know how *

42:29.485 --> 42:32.584
* we'll get by, get by *

42:32.650 --> 42:35.318
* we'll get by,
