00:01.000 --> 00:01.180
Previously on the oc

00:03.590 --> 00:07.300
I can't believe in a couple of hours we're going
to be on that stage in our cap and gowns.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.820
Went back to my old office.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.390
The place looked worse than ever.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.430
You want to go back.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.450
Oh,my God,it's him.

00:15.470 --> 00:17.170
Kaitlin.
Dr.Roberts!

00:17.200 --> 00:18.910
All the older kids,they've graduated.

00:18.930 --> 00:20.640
Now I can rule Harbor.

00:20.818 --> 00:21.730
Oh,my God,okay.

00:21.743 --> 00:24.746
I'm going to get him to pull the car over so we can finally finish this!

00:24.789 --> 00:28.440
"We are happy to announce that your application has been approved.

00:28.466 --> 00:29.446
" I start in January.

00:29.469 --> 00:34.352
I figured Brown was a little Vanity Fair for my taste,and now I'm considering the Sorbonne.

00:34.388 --> 00:36.562
One more Cooper family hug.

00:41.195 --> 00:42.680
Marissa!

00:45.095 --> 00:46.262
No.

00:46.308 --> 00:48.371
You were the first person I met here.

00:48.397 --> 00:51.081
I'd kind of like to be the last person to say good-bye.

00:51.548 --> 00:54.261

01:23.446 --> 01:24.642
Hello?

01:27.567 --> 01:28.700
Hi.

01:31.527 --> 01:33.702
Right now,no.

01:36.185 --> 01:37.590
Yeah.

01:37.966 --> 01:39.711
Yeah,okay.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.091
I'll be right there.

02:11.408 --> 02:12.700
Is he here?

02:13.718 --> 02:16.083
Thank you.You've been very helpful.

02:19.318 --> 02:21.180
Hey,Ryan,you there?

02:21.607 --> 02:23.820
I just want to talk to you for a minute.

02:23.865 --> 02:25.750
Come on.We miss you!

02:26.066 --> 02:27.901
We're worried about you.

03:17.107 --> 03:19.163
Hey,Kaitlin,why aren't you in school?

03:19.185 --> 03:22.532
Because it's 8:00 at night and a Saturday.

03:22.588 --> 03:23.481
Oh,that's nice.

03:23.496 --> 03:25.582
Well,I guess I'm going to get going.

03:25.636 --> 03:26.681
Where are you going?

03:26.718 --> 03:28.610
You know you're not supposed to be driving at night anymore.

03:28.646 --> 03:30.141
Great boots,baby.

03:32.756 --> 03:35.420
Mom,maybe I should go with you.

03:53.777 --> 03:55.561
Hey,Ryan.

03:55.737 --> 03:57.582
Come on in.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.291
The O.C 4x01
resynchro: Subripeur

04:07.008 --> 04:09.751
<i>www.forom.com</i>

04:32.455 --> 04:36.173
So Friday morning,a little
check-in before the weekend.

04:36.178 --> 04:39.240
I'm still here,kicking it Newport style.

04:39.406 --> 04:41.470
I can't believe I just said that.

04:41.628 --> 04:44.152
But,uh,yeah,things are good.

04:44.177 --> 04:47.002
Ryan's decision to defer college
seems to be working out well.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.562
He's got a new place,new job,made some new friends.

04:55.617 --> 04:59.750
Sandy Cohen is doing what he does best,fighting
the man,sticking up for the little guy.

04:59.786 --> 05:02.003
I don't care if a plea helps the judge make his tee time.

05:02.028 --> 05:04.252
Listen,listen,I've got to go.My kid's here.

05:04.285 --> 05:05.481
All right.

05:06.076 --> 05:09.452
Big news,the other day I went roast beef,he went turkey.

05:09.486 --> 05:14.023
Roast beef wasn't as rare as I like,but he's really turned me on to the spicy mustard.

05:14.045 --> 05:16.373
And my mom,she's more of a honey mustard gal,

05:16.426 --> 05:20.860
which I discovered the other day when she invited me to join her for a Newpsie luncheon.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.730
They're actually not that bad if you take the time to get to know them.

05:23.787 --> 05:26.270
And that Teran,one of the great dry wits.

05:26.307 --> 05:30.211
And I said,"Honey,that is not toothpaste.

05:31.288 --> 05:33.211
" "It's not toothpaste.

05:33.247 --> 05:34.553
" Tell us another.

05:34.587 --> 05:37.972
Although she's not a fan of tuna,but do you know who is?

05:38.006 --> 05:39.012
This is the shot.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.982
Me and your dad have really bonded.

05:41.018 --> 05:43.181
Been a lot of that,me and adults bonding.

05:43.207 --> 05:44.433
No!

05:44.617 --> 05:45.442
How could he miss that?

05:45.467 --> 05:48.222
Although I do see Kaitlin from time to time.

05:55.127 --> 06:00.721
You'll never guess who she's befriended- Brad and Eric Ward,Luke's twin brothers.

06:01.377 --> 06:04.192
They seem to be a chip right off Luke's block.

06:04.228 --> 06:06.572
Taylor sent me some pics from Paris- did you get them,too?

06:06.626 --> 06:09.293
Her  e-mail was in French.I'm not quite sure what it said.

06:09.315 --> 06:10.960
Maybe your French is better than mine.

06:10.997 --> 06:13.350
Anyway,it was good to catch up.

06:13.396 --> 06:15.882
Only a couple more months until I'm at RISD and we're together.

06:15.905 --> 06:21.692
xxxxxxxx

06:30.937 --> 06:32.292
boycott caged chicken

06:32.327 --> 06:35.170
Summer,we got to get out on the quad.This thing' going down,like,right now.

06:35.207 --> 06:37.771
Chafe,hey,um,what are we protesting?

06:37.807 --> 06:39.342
The chickens,man.It's the chickens!

06:39.375 --> 06:41.090
Right,okay,just give me a sec.

06:41.128 --> 06:44.053
Every second that goes by,another chicken is caged.

06:44.076 --> 06:45.630
Then let's get out there.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.563
Yeah.

07:03.605 --> 07:04.821
What?

07:05.037 --> 07:07.902
I'm sorry,maybe I didn't understand you correctly.

07:07.948 --> 07:15.603
Did you seriously just ask if there was a comic book based on the X-Men movie?

07:25.136 --> 07:26.531
Hey,sweetheart.

07:26.567 --> 07:27.440
How's work?

07:27.477 --> 07:28.633
Uh,I'm worried,Mom.

07:28.666 --> 07:30.401
I'm worried about the future of America.

07:30.426 --> 07:31.163
Leon.

07:31.198 --> 07:33.591
The whole world's going to hell.
Hey,Leon.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.721
I brought some...
Another care package for Ryan?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.992
Well,just a few things: coffee,bagels,cereal,

07:38.038 --> 07:40.683
and I was hoping you could put in some comic books,but nothing too dark.

07:40.707 --> 07:42.560
I'm sure some Archie and Jughead will cheer him right up.

07:42.595 --> 07:43.260
Seth.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.763
I don't know what you're expecting,Mom.The guy's changed.

07:48.156 --> 07:52.451
I will take the care package over where'll it'll sit next to all the other ones he hasn't opened in the last five months.

07:52.498 --> 07:54.841
Why don't you invite him for dinner?

07:54.956 --> 07:56.293
He didn't go to Marissa's funeral.

07:56.356 --> 08:00.321
You really think he wants to come over for family dinner at the Cohen's?

08:23.218 --> 08:26.931
Julie!

08:27.736 --> 08:31.132
Julie,what on God's formerly green Earth are you doing?

08:31.166 --> 08:31.891
Oh,hi.

08:31.915 --> 08:32.900
Am I making too much noise?

08:32.928 --> 08:35.860
For  the people who live in San Diego,no,but for the rest of us,yes.

08:35.888 --> 08:37.071
I was surveying the yard this morning.

08:37.106 --> 08:39.260
I think Ernesto has gotten sloppy with these scrubs.

08:39.298 --> 08:40.539
Julie,stop it.

08:40.577 --> 08:41.472
Julie,stop it.

08:41.498 --> 08:43.163
Turn that...Put that thing down.

08:43.186 --> 08:46.750
Take off the goggles and talk to me.

08:47.125 --> 08:50.923
That would also require your removing the kerchief from around your mouth.Thank you.

08:51.168 --> 08:54.242
You want to hire new landscapers?I'll be happy to do the interviews.

08:54.276 --> 08:56.722
That's a good idea,honey.
Listen to me.

08:57.137 --> 09:01.301
I know that all this busybody business is your way of coping with an unspeakable grief,

09:01.347 --> 09:05.263
but you're either going 100 miles an hour at the bushes or you're catatonic in bed.

09:05.305 --> 09:08.880
Oh,I'm just so tired from all the yard work.

09:09.077 --> 09:10.990
Julie,I'm not saying get over it.

09:11.016 --> 09:12.050
I'm not telling you to move on.

09:12.086 --> 09:17.410
I want you to take as long as you need,but would you please just let me in?

09:17.466 --> 09:19.590
Just let me help.

09:20.267 --> 09:21.760
Okay...

09:22.065 --> 09:23.242
you hire the landscapers.

09:23.276 --> 09:27.971
I'm going to go plug in my glue gun and finish those sea grass placemats I started last night.

09:28.005 --> 09:29.571
Thanks,hon.

09:40.207 --> 09:43.021
Hey,Kaitlin,can I give you a ride to school?

09:43.046 --> 09:44.583
Thanks.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.260
You know,it's nothing personal.

09:47.306 --> 09:49.233
She ignores me,too.

09:49.257 --> 09:51.731
I'm starting to think it's a good thing.

09:53.557 --> 09:55.080
R yan!

09:57.608 --> 09:58.413
Ryan!

09:58.425 --> 10:00.221
Seth,go away.I'm sleeping.

10:00.306 --> 10:01.693
You're sleeping?

10:01.717 --> 10:03.740
And you're talking?

10:03.778 --> 10:08.122
Ryan,I don't even see how that's possible unless you're talking in your sleep.

10:08.157 --> 10:10.941
Hey,look,you're awake.
Package from your mom.Thank you.

10:10.988 --> 10:12.460
Yeah.

10:13.803 --> 10:15.346
Aren't you going to invite me in?

10:15.369 --> 10:19.540
So the utility closet is the new pool house.Things change.

10:19.566 --> 10:21.456
It's the Seth Ryan time that counts.

10:21.489 --> 10:22.702
I'm tired Seth.I work nights.

10:22.726 --> 10:25.573
Right,but you don't work tonight,I checked with your boss,

10:25.648 --> 10:27.872
which is why I'm inviting you to dinner with us.

10:27.896 --> 10:31.121
Just show up.Eat some food,let my parents see that you're still alive.

10:31.146 --> 10:34.171
It'd mean a lot to them,and it'd mean a lot to me.

10:34.386 --> 10:36.173
Yeah,okay,sure,I'll see you tonight.
Great.

10:36.206 --> 10:37.802
Hey,what are you doing?

10:37.848 --> 10:39.680
I was going to get some ice cream or something.

10:39.846 --> 10:40.793
Okay.

10:40.795 --> 10:44.491
Cette barbarie envers nos freres et
soeur de la nature doivent cesser

10:44.518 --> 10:47.442
Et il ne s'arreteront pas avant
que nous ne nous les aidions .

10:47.486 --> 10:48.533
Les poulets,

10:48.545 --> 10:50.571
Ne peuvent se defendrent eux memes.

10:50.618 --> 10:52.650
What are they going to do,unionize?

10:53.027 --> 10:54.602
Strike for better living conditions?

10:54.625 --> 10:57.591
It is up to us,man,to speak for them!

10:57.885 --> 11:00.182
Give poultry a voice!

11:00.688 --> 11:02.990
Chicken lovers of the world,unite!

11:03.018 --> 11:05.411
J'adore le poulet.Les nuggets sont delicieuse.

11:05.448 --> 11:08.453
It is people like you keeping the chickens from flying free.

11:08.477 --> 11:10.570
Les poulets ne peuvent voler.

11:11.677 --> 11:14.951
Oh,who are you to say that chickens can't fly.

11:15.015 --> 11:19.663
All it takes is one brave chicken to spread his wings and fly into the abyss.

11:20.018 --> 11:21.140
Ouai.

11:21.178 --> 11:23.122
Merci,Chafe.

11:28.015 --> 11:28.610
Hello.

11:28.636 --> 11:30.122
Bonjour!

11:30.167 --> 11:31.340
Taylor?

11:31.375 --> 11:32.331
Oh,mon dieu.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.732
I think you mean mon Dieu,Summer.

11:35.837 --> 11:37.200
Oui,c'est moi.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.451
How's Paris?

11:38.496 --> 11:39.993
Incroyable.

11:40.015 --> 11:43.180
You know,being an expat totally suits me.

11:43.218 --> 11:45.260
Except that I miss you.

11:45.308 --> 11:49.331
You can only parlez so much Francais until you start to get a little nostalgic for the motherland.

11:49.356 --> 11:50.281
Summer!

11:50.317 --> 11:51.500
Une seconde, Taylor.

11:51.525 --> 11:52.763
The copy shop is about to close.

11:52.786 --> 11:54.463
We got to run off some more flyers.

11:54.486 --> 11:55.542
Totally.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.860
Tell them to use the recycled paper.

11:58.867 --> 12:00.672
Taylor,tu sais quoi ?I actually have to go.

12:00.705 --> 12:02.101
Oh,pas de problème.

12:02.135 --> 12:03.452
Well,it was great to talk to you.

12:03.476 --> 12:06.510
Listen,don't be a stranger,and have a great time in Paris.

12:06.536 --> 12:07.793
Vive la France,Summer.

12:07.835 --> 12:09.523
Vive la France!

12:17.008 --> 12:20.461
Je peux avoir un peu plus de café ?

12:21.868 --> 12:23.440
Merci.

12:25.988 --> 12:30.320
Okay,taste this and tell me if it's ready.

12:31.078 --> 12:34.983
It's hot!

12:36.087 --> 12:38.221
It is so hot!
Did I overcook it?

12:38.256 --> 12:40.322
It is definitely not undercooked.

12:40.358 --> 12:42.332
table's set for four.Actually feels kind of weird.

12:42.366 --> 12:44.400
Well,things have been a little weird around here until lately.

12:44.405 --> 12:45.830
Tonight might not be any different.

12:45.845 --> 12:47.303
We shouldn't be expecting any miracles.

12:47.327 --> 12:50.143
No zippy one-liners?
Not a lot of smiles.

12:50.165 --> 12:54.402
A few grunts.An occasional shrug.

12:55.766 --> 12:58.282
Yeah,it'll be just like old times.
I'm looking forward to it.

12:58.325 --> 12:59.543
He'll be here any minute.

12:59.566 --> 13:02.572
So,ready or not,the pasta is coming off the stove.

13:02.596 --> 13:04.570
Oh,stand back,son.She's ready to blow.

13:04.597 --> 13:07.082
'Cause it's hot,that's funny.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.050
Hey,man,good to see you.

13:33.095 --> 13:35.731
I heard you making plans with that kid.I didn't think you were going to show.

13:35.758 --> 13:36.510
I wouldn't miss it.

13:36.548 --> 13:39.493
All right,you drew that guy.

13:41.825 --> 13:43.780
No,no.Not tonight.

13:43.817 --> 13:45.953
What about him?

13:48.418 --> 13:50.300
What are you,crazy?

13:50.336 --> 13:51.831
No.I'm good.

13:52.846 --> 13:54.343
All right.

14:13.426 --> 14:15.743
Well,I thought dinner was excellent.

14:15.775 --> 14:18.100
Do you think anything happened to him?

14:18.146 --> 14:20.533
Ryan,it's Sandy again.

14:20.686 --> 14:22.872
The microwave still works,if you feel like dropping by.

14:22.878 --> 14:25.813
And,even if you don't,please call,huh?

14:25.855 --> 14:27.870
Let us know you're okay.

14:28.957 --> 14:30.031
Should we call the police?

14:30.066 --> 14:33.082
Hospitals?
No.Mom,he's fine.

14:33.178 --> 14:35.130
Well,he's not,you know,fine,but he's not coming.

14:35.158 --> 14:38.910
Well,even if Ryan didn't want to come,he would have called,Ryan always calls.

14:39.907 --> 14:41.343
Where are you going?

14:41.708 --> 14:43.022
I'm going to try and talk to him.

14:43.048 --> 14:47.081
no offense,Dad,but I don't think he is going to be in the mood for one of your pep talks right now,

14:47.116 --> 14:50.203
as  inspiring and motivational as they usually are.

14:50.247 --> 14:51.390
I'll go.

14:51.405 --> 14:53.991
Thanks for the compliment,however backhanded.Are you sure?

14:54.026 --> 14:55.841
Do you want your father to go with you?

14:55.876 --> 14:57.510
No,I got it.

15:05.407 --> 15:07.650
Dude,this place is crawling with Security.

15:07.678 --> 15:09.303
You really think it's the best place to smoke up?

15:09.338 --> 15:13.913
They're just a bunch of rent-a-cops,and this shwag you guys gave me is barely pot anyway.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.213
We might as well be smoking dirt.
Sorry.

15:16.257 --> 15:17.412
The guy said that's all he had.

15:17.445 --> 15:19.272
Yeah,just blame it on your lame dealer.

15:19.298 --> 15:22.450
But,if I don't get an "A" in chemistry,I have only you two to blame.

15:22.476 --> 15:25.490
So,less whining,more lab reporting.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.543
Oh,no.

15:32.567 --> 15:33.891
What?

15:35.358 --> 15:36.530
Cops?

15:37.115 --> 15:38.613
No.

15:41.355 --> 15:44.113
Who's that skank with Dr.Roberts?

15:44.858 --> 15:46.063
I know that chick.

15:46.087 --> 15:48.520
Oh,yeah.That's Gloria.

15:48.566 --> 15:50.092
Gloria?

15:50.128 --> 15:51.251
Why does that sound familiar?

15:51.286 --> 15:52.791
She used to be friends with our mom.

15:52.816 --> 15:55.320
Before Dr.Roberts divorced her.

16:00.318 --> 16:03.202
So that's the step-monster?

16:08.735 --> 16:12.350
xxxxxxxxx

16:43.815 --> 16:46.413
I'm trying to hold it together here,but...

16:47.835 --> 16:48.911
I'm sorry.

16:48.958 --> 16:51.433
I know you're doing the college thing,I know I'm supposed to give you space.

16:51.455 --> 16:52.961
Just,um...

16:53.008 --> 16:55.232
call when you can,okay?Bye.

16:55.375 --> 16:58.491
Dude,I hear that kid from the bar is going to get his ass kicked.

17:06.777 --> 17:09.310
Do it!

17:14.738 --> 17:16.521
Do it!

17:53.377 --> 17:55.642
Hey,Summer,you probably can't hear your phone right now

17:55.667 --> 17:58.450
because of all the noise at your awesome college party.

17:58.476 --> 18:00.143
I hope it's awesome.

18:00.168 --> 18:03.911
I realize that sounded sarcastic,but,genuinely,I hope you're having a good night.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.630
I'm just in some sketchy neighborhood trying to find Ryan.

18:06.666 --> 18:08.572
Hey,it's your turn to jam on the didg.

18:08.806 --> 18:11.170
Okay,I'll just be there in a sec,okay?

18:11.216 --> 18:13.193
Okay.Is everything all right?

18:13.226 --> 18:14.523
Yeah.

18:15.548 --> 18:18.940
It's just,when I left to move out here,everything was kind of a mess at home.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.800
Well,it's about to get worse.

18:20.825 --> 18:25.392
If the polar ice caps keep melting at their current rate,all of Newport Beach is going to be underwater in ten years.

18:25.417 --> 18:26.041
Right.

18:26.066 --> 18:28.750
Well,it's a little more than that.

18:28.828 --> 18:31.703
Everyone hasn't really moved on like I have.

18:31.738 --> 18:34.193
I think my friends need me.

18:34.365 --> 18:37.533
Hey,Summer,wherever you go...

18:37.946 --> 18:39.870
there you are.

18:59.617 --> 19:02.662
Not to sound like my mom,but I'm worried about him.

19:02.705 --> 19:05.353
He could be in real trouble this time.

19:12.975 --> 19:14.171
Hello.

19:14.208 --> 19:15.702
Julie!My God!Are you all right?

19:15.706 --> 19:17.161
What  happened?Was there an earthquake I didn't hear?

19:17.208 --> 19:19.331
No.Help me.

19:19.846 --> 19:22.270
I was just trying to rearrange some furniture.

19:22.298 --> 19:24.181
I got some very helpful tips from HGTV.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.181
Oh,great,and they suggested that you try to move a built-in?

19:27.206 --> 19:28.771
I didn't know it was a built-in.

19:28.806 --> 19:30.133
Well,it's not anymore.

19:30.158 --> 19:32.190
Mom,what are you doing?

19:32.245 --> 19:34.720
Rearranging the furniture?

19:35.416 --> 19:36.852
It's a built-in.

19:36.878 --> 19:38.462
Yes,thank you.

19:39.727 --> 19:41.852
Dr.Roberts wasn't there to help you?

19:41.895 --> 19:43.911
Yeah,Neil.Where have you been?

19:43.946 --> 19:45.660
I had a procedure.

19:45.697 --> 19:47.561
Emergency tummy tuck.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.192
Thank God you were there to prevent a tragedy from occurring.

19:50.216 --> 19:51.750
I have no feeling in my extremities.

19:51.776 --> 19:53.141
I'm sure you have a pill for that.

19:53.178 --> 19:54.172
Back off,Neil.

19:54.195 --> 19:56.530
I was almost just killed by your heinous furniture.

19:56.556 --> 19:57.682
It's mahogany.

19:57.717 --> 19:59.983
It was original with the house.

20:07.305 --> 20:09.953
Well,man,you do draw a crowd.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.682
They haven't seen a human punching bag before.

20:11.715 --> 20:13.702
Here's your money.You earned it.
No,no.

20:13.726 --> 20:15.491
Keep it.

20:16.485 --> 20:18.171
Suit yourself.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.291
How you going to pay for your hospital bill?

20:20.346 --> 20:21.930
I'll see you.

20:22.148 --> 20:23.761
Hey,man.

20:25.397 --> 20:28.571
I saw your little performance.This is very Fight Club.

20:28.848 --> 20:32.243
Of course,at the end of that movie,it turns out Edward Norton's insane.

20:32.266 --> 20:34.001
Sorry I missed dinner.

20:34.205 --> 20:37.470
Well,not as sorry as my parents.

20:38.075 --> 20:40.283
You want to tell them about your new vocation,or should I?

20:40.318 --> 20:43.671
I'm not going to tell them about it,and neither are you.

20:44.968 --> 20:45.982
Sorry.

20:46.006 --> 20:47.593
Just forget it.

20:47.628 --> 20:49.692
Well,I don't know.Sandy's got a really good memory.

20:49.717 --> 20:52.173
It's not going to be so easy for him to forget the kid he adopted,

20:52.195 --> 20:53.812
and my mom's still kind of fond of you,so...

20:53.845 --> 20:56.063
I'm doing you guys a favor staying away.

20:56.086 --> 20:58.290
You're doing us a favor?
Face it,man.I bring trouble.

20:58.305 --> 21:00.632
Trey,Volchok,you and your family- you're...

21:00.668 --> 21:05.042
you're better off without me.
It's not true.It's not your fault.

21:05.646 --> 21:07.780
Any of it.

21:08.616 --> 21:11.690
I'm not going to go anywhere until you come with me.

21:11.828 --> 21:13.752
Yeah?What are you going to do?You going to fight me?

21:13.786 --> 21:16.470
Well,seeing as how you don't fight back...

21:16.626 --> 21:19.483
I just don't any more,okay?

21:24.318 --> 21:25.622
Pancakes extra fluffy.

21:25.645 --> 21:27.482
Bacon extra crispy.

21:27.505 --> 21:29.361
So start talking.

21:29.607 --> 21:32.030
If you think you can ply me with food...

21:33.015 --> 21:34.971
you're right,this bacon is delicious.
Thank you.

21:34.995 --> 21:36.282
But I already told you everything last night.

21:36.287 --> 21:38.830
Yes,you gave us the facts- he's working,he's busy,he forgot.

21:38.866 --> 21:40.580
Yeah,but we're not buying it.
That's what he said.

21:40.618 --> 21:42.030
What are you looking for from me?

21:42.058 --> 21:44.590
Reading between the lines.
Subtext?

21:44.895 --> 21:46.260
How'd he look?

21:46.317 --> 21:48.221
Uh,he's looked better.

21:48.255 --> 21:49.773
But he's looked worse.

21:49.795 --> 21:53.751
You know,he might have cut himself shaving or something,uh,had a few nicks here and there.

21:53.776 --> 21:56.040
He was bleeding?
The bleeding had stopped.

21:56.065 --> 21:59.533
You know,they actually have coffee at work,which is where I'm going.

21:59.567 --> 22:04.080
So thank you very much for breakfast,and if I hear of anything else I will let you know.

22:04.258 --> 22:08.981
And,you guys,probably best just to give him a little more time.

22:12.276 --> 22:14.243
How much more time until we can't reach him?

22:14.276 --> 22:17.003
I'm going to check in on Ryan right after work.

22:29.628 --> 22:31.021
Cohen!

22:36.066 --> 22:37.302
I was just looking for you.

22:37.327 --> 22:39.512
Summer,what are you doing here?

22:39.596 --> 22:41.271
I got your message.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.752
Oh,I'm sorry,I didn't...

22:43.786 --> 22:45.121
mean for you to,uh...

22:45.145 --> 22:46.660
It  sounded like an emergency.

22:46.685 --> 22:48.323
Oh,uh...

22:50.556 --> 22:53.143
Yeah,no,it kind of is.

22:53.176 --> 22:54.902
Well,I'm here to help.

22:55.088 --> 22:57.440
I'm so glad you came home for me.

22:57.505 --> 23:00.783
And for Ryan.
Yeah,no,that's what I meant.

23:01.177 --> 23:02.592
Right.

23:11.046 --> 23:12.641
Hey,Kaitlin...

23:12.817 --> 23:14.450
didn't hear you come in.

23:14.487 --> 23:16.812
Yeah,with your manly grunts,how could you?

23:16.817 --> 23:18.463
It's important to keep in shape.

23:18.508 --> 23:21.073
They say sex is a really good form of exercise,

23:21.106 --> 23:23.243
although I doubt you're getting any with my mother these days.

23:23.268 --> 23:25.241
Our personal life is personal.

23:25.276 --> 23:28.931
Let's talk about your personal life with those other than my mother.

23:31.495 --> 23:33.381
Listen,young lady...

23:33.978 --> 23:36.901
I don't think I understand what you're talking about.

23:36.978 --> 23:39.360
So,if you'll excuse me.

23:39.967 --> 23:42.952
So yesterday when you said you were at work...

23:42.986 --> 23:45.573
do you always do your consults down by the beach?

23:45.607 --> 23:47.082
With a leggy blonde?

23:47.128 --> 23:49.491
One you used to be married to?

23:51.847 --> 23:54.971
I don't know what you think you saw,

23:55.035 --> 23:57.243
but adult relationships can be very complex.

23:57.267 --> 23:58.110
I know.

23:58.135 --> 24:01.071
And that's why I was going to ask my mother to explain.

24:01.117 --> 24:05.841
Then I thought with everything that's happened to her,to us,I didn't want to upset her.

24:05.875 --> 24:06.791
That's a good instinct.

24:06.825 --> 24:08.872
But then I was going to ask her another question.

24:08.907 --> 24:12.151
About these leather boots I saw down at the plaza.

24:12.228 --> 24:16.121
They're really cute,and really expensive.

24:16.277 --> 24:18.832
I'm a seven and a half.

24:31.465 --> 24:32.851
Hey,Brad,Eric.

24:32.878 --> 24:34.290
Hey,Mrs.Cohen.

24:35.685 --> 24:37.120
Man,is she hot.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.760
Smoking.

24:41.597 --> 24:43.363
Hey,sweetheart,how's your mother?

24:43.398 --> 24:46.993
She's recovering from an unfortunate accident with a wall unit.

24:47.016 --> 24:48.431
I told her it was a built-in.

24:48.455 --> 24:50.040
She's in her room if you want to go in.

24:50.067 --> 24:52.523
It's not like she'll know you're there anyway.

25:05.297 --> 25:07.641
$1,500 for a pair of boots?

25:07.677 --> 25:10.502
Do you know how many pencils I could buy Sudanese school children?

25:10.515 --> 25:13.011
Intro to Developing Nations,it's one of my favorite classes.

25:13.056 --> 25:15.623
Yeah,I can see that.It's very cool.

25:16.496 --> 25:20.313
Followed closely by Environmental Studies.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.072
Gosh,this is a non-renewable resource.

25:22.107 --> 25:24.322
I can't believe this place doesn't have a recycling program.

25:24.358 --> 25:26.253
You should call our local councilman.

25:26.285 --> 25:27.312
Good idea.

25:27.348 --> 25:28.570
I was being sarcastic.

25:28.608 --> 25:31.353
Oh,I don't do sarcasm anymore,I'm post-ironic.

25:31.386 --> 25:32.391
You mean earnest?

25:32.418 --> 25:34.502
Hey,I'm not here to help the environment,okay?

25:34.525 --> 25:35.793
I'm here to help Ryan.

25:35.816 --> 25:37.240
Except he doesn't want our help right now,

25:37.265 --> 25:40.391
so why don't I take you home?You can drop off your bag.

25:40.425 --> 25:41.220
No.You know what?

25:41.225 --> 25:44.033
I'm just going to meet my dad for dinner and then come right back here,so...

25:44.047 --> 25:45.563
So you're not even going home?
No.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.051
Yes.Of course.

25:47.085 --> 25:50.980
I just don't know if we'll have time.I mean,we have a lot of work to do.

25:50.987 --> 25:54.561
3,000 miles at 30,000 feet,I had a lot of time to think.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.040
Rally up your geek army.

25:56.067 --> 25:57.473
I have a plan.

26:00.205 --> 26:01.812
Julie,it's me.

26:01.846 --> 26:04.251
Kirsten?
Yeah.

26:04.316 --> 26:06.313
Can I come in?

26:06.638 --> 26:08.051
Today's not a good day.

26:08.077 --> 26:09.132
I know.

26:09.165 --> 26:13.590
None of them are,but hiding in your room won't make it better.

26:21.396 --> 26:22.681
Oh,thank God it's you.

26:22.716 --> 26:24.490
I was starting to think you'd forgotten about me.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.602
We can sit outside and talk.

26:26.638 --> 26:28.113
I'll make some tea.

26:28.138 --> 26:30.630
Can I call you back?

26:32.927 --> 26:36.112
Kirsten,it's so thoughtful of you to stop by.

26:36.146 --> 26:38.430
But as you can see,everything's fine.

26:38.455 --> 26:39.531
But you said it wasn't a good day.

26:39.565 --> 26:43.113
For visitors,because I'm so very busy.

26:43.246 --> 26:45.400
Thanks for stopping by,Keeks.

26:46.228 --> 26:48.181
Oh,love your top.

26:53.168 --> 26:55.342
Can we have a table for two,please?

26:55.485 --> 26:57.232
My little girl is home.

26:57.317 --> 26:59.802
Dad,I'm going to use the bathroom,then I'll find you.

26:59.847 --> 27:01.110
Okay.

27:03.837 --> 27:05.293
excuse me

27:05.488 --> 27:08.462
excuse me,would you pls hurry up

27:11.027 --> 27:13.380
"To go" means "to go," implying in a hurry.

27:13.415 --> 27:15.391
I mean,how long does it take to club a turkey?

27:15.417 --> 27:17.811
Should I put it on your family's tab?

27:17.845 --> 27:20.940
Considering I have no money other than euros,yes.

27:22.688 --> 27:24.163
Oh,my God.

27:24.966 --> 27:25.802
Summer.

27:25.827 --> 27:27.360
I just talked to you,you were in France.

27:27.387 --> 27:29.411
And you were in Rhode Island.

27:29.447 --> 27:32.073
It's just amazing the way this world works.

27:32.097 --> 27:34.403
What are you doing back in Newport?

27:35.768 --> 27:36.823
Are you meeting your mom?

27:36.845 --> 27:39.752
My mom,no.My mom is in Cabo,she won't...

27:39.786 --> 27:42.042
be back for a few days.

27:43.638 --> 27:45.471
Oh,my God,my mom.

27:45.718 --> 27:47.002
xxxxxxxxxx

27:47.437 --> 27:48.962
you never saw me.

27:57.077 --> 27:59.601
Ryan,it's Julie.

27:59.648 --> 28:02.102
It's important.

28:53.026 --> 28:54.151
What's this?

28:54.197 --> 28:56.370
It's why I needed to see you.

28:56.667 --> 29:03.282
You see,after it happened,I hired a private investigator to find out where he went.

29:03.308 --> 29:04.900
Volchok.

29:04.956 --> 29:06.892
And now I know.

29:07.148 --> 29:10.481
All the information is in this file.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.742
I'm not giving it to the cops.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.683
Jail's too good for him.

29:15.725 --> 29:17.780
I'm giving it to you.

29:17.868 --> 29:20.842
You're the only person who can understand how I feel.

29:20.888 --> 29:25.943
And you can do with it,with him,what you want.

29:32.325 --> 29:34.862
I don't want it.
What?

29:34.908 --> 29:39.202
I don't care about him,I don't care about any of it,and I don't want to start.

29:40.925 --> 29:43.540
That's a-That's a lie,Ryan.

29:43.578 --> 29:45.171
That's...

29:45.707 --> 29:47.042
I know you.

29:47.066 --> 29:54.043
Even if you didn't come to her funeral or never visit her grave,you still care.

31:10.535 --> 31:14.430
You know,I don't usually refer to myself as a genius,but I may have to make an exception.

31:14.467 --> 31:16.940
Leon,how is the ink coming?

31:19.435 --> 31:20.750
Hey!

31:21.197 --> 31:24.021
Am I the only one who's working here?

31:26.026 --> 31:28.002
Get off,mouth breather.

31:28.035 --> 31:30.313
Summer,if you want to go home and shower,we can take it from here.

31:30.345 --> 31:32.140
No,we can't.I want to go home and shower.

31:32.165 --> 31:35.351
That's okay,I'll just take a little sponge bath in the ladies room.

31:35.376 --> 31:36.011
Really?

31:36.036 --> 31:39.723
Because you're normally pretty rigorously about your bathing.

31:39.757 --> 31:41.601
I'm going to go get Ryan.

31:41.658 --> 31:45.061
Yeah,okay,great,it's just,um,I mean,you haven't even been home yet.

31:45.098 --> 31:46.443
You don't want to drop off your bag or...

31:46.475 --> 31:47.623
What's the point of going home?

31:47.655 --> 31:53.020
If the polar ice caps keep melting at their current rate,all of Newport will be under water in ten years anyway.

32:14.616 --> 32:15.701
Summer.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.403
Hey,Atwood.

32:18.808 --> 32:20.172
If you came here to talk...

32:20.195 --> 32:21.413
You're not talking.

32:21.445 --> 32:22.830
I got it.

32:23.006 --> 32:25.113
Great to see you,too.

32:27.745 --> 32:31.841
I really like what you've done with your whole face.

32:36.148 --> 32:38.880
So,I'm going to need you to come with me now.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.090
Can't do it; got to work.

32:43.626 --> 32:45.060
Right.

32:45.376 --> 32:50.261
Running that germy rag across those filthy tables,it's really important stuff.

32:50.347 --> 32:54.152
Look,I just flew 3,000 miles...
I didn't ask you to.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.821
No,Seth did.

32:59.385 --> 33:00.913
He's worried about you.

33:00.945 --> 33:01.952
So are the Cohens.

33:01.985 --> 33:04.702
I know you think that you're protecting them,but...

33:04.706 --> 33:07.193
you're not,you're just hurting them.

33:07.578 --> 33:11.003
Besides,Seth keeps leaving me these endless whiny messages.

33:11.046 --> 33:14.380
They're totally clogging up my voice mail.

33:15.278 --> 33:17.052
Ryan,come on,take a deep breath.

33:17.087 --> 33:18.903
Just let me do what I do best.

33:18.946 --> 33:21.532
Which is what?
Giving orders.

33:21.745 --> 33:25.043
Just do what I say,Atwood,one last time.

33:48.065 --> 33:51.742
Did I see Kaitlin driving off in the Lexus?

33:55.316 --> 33:57.972
The silent treatment,huh?

33:58.456 --> 34:01.843
So I guess Kaitlin has talked to you.

34:03.798 --> 34:06.751
Julie,I didn't mean for this to happen.

34:06.796 --> 34:09.533
I just needed somebody to talk to,

34:09.678 --> 34:14.251
and at first that's all it was,just...talk.

34:14.277 --> 34:17.731
But you're not even listening to me,are you?

34:18.648 --> 34:20.690
What?

34:23.025 --> 34:24.703
Nothing.

34:34.737 --> 34:37.121
So why are we going to the comic bookstore?

34:37.157 --> 34:41.431
Because I said so and you agreed to do what I said,so...

34:41.485 --> 34:47.030
As I told Seth,I don't really want to...talk.

34:49.656 --> 34:51.150
You don't have to talk.

34:51.187 --> 34:52.331
You don't even have to listen.

34:52.366 --> 34:54.170
All you have to do is read.

34:54.206 --> 34:56.313
Look,Leon,lights.

34:57.726 --> 34:59.663
Wh-Wh-What's this?

35:03.116 --> 35:04.333
You made me a comic book?

35:04.357 --> 35:06.173
This is no ordinary comic book,my friend.

35:06.198 --> 35:07.861
This is an origin story.

35:07.888 --> 35:13.672
Now you may never save the planet,but you did save us,so this is our story.

35:17.646 --> 35:21.521
Now,it's true when you showed up,I had a super power,but it was one I didn't want.

35:21.555 --> 35:25.332
Being invisible,not as much fun as it sounds.

35:26.097 --> 35:29.362
And the ice queen was surrounded by an impenetrable force field.

35:29.385 --> 35:32.882
And her silver cell phone was her only link to the outside world.

35:32.918 --> 35:38.023
The litigator strained to hold up the weight of the world so burdened with the problems of others

35:38.056 --> 35:41.353
that he couldn't see those of his own family.

35:46.556 --> 35:49.193
One day the litigator brought his work home with him.

35:49.226 --> 35:52.611
Only this time,his work looked strangely like a young Russell Crowe.

35:52.636 --> 35:56.350
It's okay,Seth,I can read.

36:44.905 --> 36:47.451
Well,here we are.

36:47.485 --> 36:48.862
That's it.

36:49.657 --> 36:51.982
Thanks for taking the time,

36:52.567 --> 36:55.423
letting us make fools of ourselves.

36:55.468 --> 36:57.283
It meant a lot to Seth.

36:57.305 --> 36:59.253
And to Kirsten.

36:59.637 --> 37:01.882
Not so much to me.

37:02.528 --> 37:04.853
I'm no softy.
No,I know.

37:04.897 --> 37:06.411
You should probably get going.

37:06.437 --> 37:07.830
You're late.

37:08.015 --> 37:11.801
I hope they don't fire me.
I bet they got great benefits,huh?

37:11.837 --> 37:13.203
Good dental?

37:13.246 --> 37:15.313
The accommodations

37:15.356 --> 37:17.153
Yeah,uh...

37:17.198 --> 37:20.762
yeah,actually,about that,I...

37:21.127 --> 37:24.390
If I,you know,ever wanted to,you know,once in a while...

37:24.396 --> 37:27.862
The,uh,the pool house is probably filled with boxes,right?

37:27.895 --> 37:30.553
It's exactly the way you left it.

37:31.267 --> 37:34.373
A little too empty if you ask me.

37:36.626 --> 37:40.152
Well,it wouldn't take me too long to pack.

37:42.048 --> 37:45.120
Kirsten's got some leftovers from last night.

37:45.158 --> 37:46.930
Thanks.

37:47.146 --> 37:49.063
Thank you.

37:51.268 --> 37:54.853
You know,at the risk of saying too much...

37:57.918 --> 38:00.443
being there with her when it happened,

38:00.905 --> 38:03.323
you're never going to get over it,

38:04.218 --> 38:06.810
but you'll get used to it.

38:08.077 --> 38:12.472
Just let yourself feel what you need to feel,even if if hurts.

38:12.517 --> 38:16.061
Yeah,one step at a time,okay?
Okay,I'm going to shut up now.

38:16.365 --> 38:19.950
Like,uh,giving these guys some notice,packing my toothbrush.

38:19.978 --> 38:22.203
Let me buy you a toothbrush.

38:22.347 --> 38:23.923
You got it.

38:25.685 --> 38:27.210
See you at home.

38:36.037 --> 38:38.352
Well,it seems like Ryan really went for it.

38:38.378 --> 38:39.420
Seems like it.
Yeah.

38:39.455 --> 38:41.211
I couldn't have done it without you.

38:41.237 --> 38:44.550
Yeah,totally,since it was my idea and I got him to show up.

38:44.586 --> 38:47.842
Sure,no,that's what I meant,so...

38:48.597 --> 38:50.243
thank you.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.171
Yeah.

39:05.858 --> 39:07.833
Why don't you go home and see if Ryan's there.

39:07.855 --> 39:09.920
You know,I really want to know what happened.
Sure,okay.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.521
Another good idea.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.272
I'll call you.
Okay.

39:16.357 --> 39:20.490
tomorrow,you want to get breakfast at the diner like old times?

39:20.527 --> 39:22.130
Sure.

39:24.077 --> 39:25.603
Okay.

40:29.815 --> 40:31.273
Hey,man.

40:31.667 --> 40:33.223
I heard you were getting out of here.

40:33.267 --> 40:34.582
Can't say I blame you.

40:34.615 --> 40:38.871
Guy from last night,he's looking for another round if you're interested.

40:42.087 --> 40:44.381
Hey,Cohen,it's me.

40:45.616 --> 40:48.910
I really hope Ryan was there when you got back,

40:48.958 --> 40:51.340
because I won't be.

40:51.376 --> 40:56.082
I totally forgot there's this protest against seal poachers and,um,

40:56.117 --> 40:58.343
Heather Mills McCartney is going to be there.

40:58.367 --> 41:03.553
I just want to see how she's doing,you know,with everything after the divorce and all,so...

41:05.678 --> 41:09.012
listen,I'm sorry,but,uh,Thanksgiving is only a few weeks away.

41:09.046 --> 41:10.601
So...

41:12.217 --> 41:13.863
okay...

41:14.608 --> 41:15.530
I love you.

41:15.565 --> 41:17.893
Give a hoot,don't pollute.Bye.

41:26.968 --> 41:31.723
marissa cooper
beloved daughter
sister,friend

41:42.758 --> 41:46.100
I was wondering when you'd finally come here.

41:47.128 --> 41:49.300
Thanks for meeting me.

41:50.447 --> 41:52.992
I'm here every day.

41:57.625 --> 41:59.573
You have it?

42:06.017 --> 42:09.850
If you don't mind me asking,what changed your mind?

42:39.228 --> 42:41.660
I just realized...

42:47.417 --> 42:48.031
i have to do this

42:49.305 --> 42:55.429
