00:02.440 --> 00:03.395
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

00:03.560 --> 00:05.357
- You gotta have a plan.
- Who are you?

00:05.520 --> 00:09.149
I stole a car. Then my mom threw me out,
so Mr. Cohen took me in. 

00:09.320 --> 00:11.515
- What is it about this kid?
- I was this kid.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.557
- Ryan's gonna stay with us now.
- That's awesome.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.951
- Do you wanna do something tonight?
- You're not, like, into him, are you?

00:17.120 --> 00:18.678
What are you doing with my girlfriend?

00:18.840 --> 00:21.434
Do you know what girls find sexy?
Confidence.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.636
Might I remind you of something
that I call:

00:23.800 --> 00:26.234
"The time that you kissed me
at my grandfather's party."

00:26.400 --> 00:27.594
What are you talking about?

00:27.760 --> 00:29.751
I never should have
broken up with you in the first place.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.195
- I don't know what I should do.
- Let me know when you decide.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.955
Jimmy's been siphoning money out of his
clients' accounts to cover his own debts.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.793
- Daddy!
- Put your personal feelings for him aside.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.757
He's one of my oldest friends.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.310
This whole community thinks
you're a criminal, Jimmy.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.278
- You're getting a divorce.
- I'm so sorry, kiddo.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.556
- What are you doing?
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.950
- I have no one.
- She's gone.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.111
And so are my stepmom's painkillers.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.358
Wake up.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.112
Wake up.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:22.400 --> 01:25.153
I have three sesame and one plain.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.752
I'm okay.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.474
Look, we're not gonna hear
from the hospital for a while.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.153
You guys get showered and dressed.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.754
And you can't be late
for your meeting with the dean.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.189
- I'll take them to school.
- You can't be late for your first day.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.713
Well, if we're not gonna eat,
let's just go.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.591
Oh, hey. Hey.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.594
She just fell back asleep.

02:24.760 --> 02:28.435
But she was awake and aware.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.828
Thanks for calling the hospital.
And finding her.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.595
If they hadn't airlifted her out, she...

02:40.760 --> 02:43.911
- When can she go home?
- They said in a day or so.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.356
- They wanna keep her under observation.
- That's hospital policy.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.670
So I guess there's no need
to worry, right?

02:49.840 --> 02:51.990
I mean, a teenage girl palms
a dozen painkillers...

02:52.160 --> 02:53.673
...and washes it down with tequila.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.515
That's perfectly normal, right?
What are you doing here?

02:57.680 --> 02:59.750
I called them.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.310
What Marissa needs right now
is to be with her family. No visitors.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.431
Well, let's go. We should go.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.397
- Lf you need anything...
- Thanks.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.834
Don't take it personally.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.639
Julie's just been through
every parent's nightmare.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.360
- I'm sure she'll apologize.
- You are?

03:26.520 --> 03:28.556
It's Julie Cooper we're talking about.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.269
Excuse me.
Ryan, can I talk to you for a sec?

03:38.480 --> 03:41.790
I don't know what happened in Mexico,
but here's what I do know:

03:41.960 --> 03:43.871
Since you showed up,
Marissa's been a wreck.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.554
Comes home crying,
doesn't wanna go to her cotillion...

03:46.720 --> 03:48.438
...having problems with her boyfriend.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.670
And now you can add another
shining accomplishment...

03:50.840 --> 03:52.159
...to your list of achievements.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.672
In addition to stealing cars,
burning down houses...

03:55.840 --> 03:58.479
...and befriending
would-be assassins...

03:58.640 --> 04:00.392
...you've almost killed my daughter.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.674
You can blame me all you want...

04:08.040 --> 04:10.918
...but I would never do anything
to hurt Marissa.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.231
Well, you're not going
to get the chance...

04:14.400 --> 04:16.595
...because you're never
going to see her again.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.719
You even try, and I'll make sure you're
thrown back in juvie, where you belong.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.710
Wait. I don't get it. Luke's the one
she should be blaming, not you.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.394
- She doesn't know that.
- So why don't you tell her?

05:05.560 --> 05:07.790
I'm just glad Marissa's okay.

05:07.960 --> 05:12.954
I'll check in with the events committee.
I'll catch up with you at the dean's office.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.839
Ryan, don't be nervous.
You're gonna do great.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.396
This is school?

05:28.240 --> 05:30.959
Registration week, Ryan.
It's my favorite time of the year...

05:31.120 --> 05:34.874
...because fellow students
aren't around to ruin it. Except them.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.990
You guys have tennis courts
and a swimming pool?

05:38.160 --> 05:40.071
I'm guessing you didn't
at your old school.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.798
Well, we had a basketball hoop.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.193
- Oh, hi, guys.
- Dr. Talley, Miss Kimrey. How are you?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.397
Okay.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.396
My mom's more popular than me.
That's a little bit pathetic, I realize.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.677
After your meeting, we gotta get
your photo taken for your school ID.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.912
- Another mug shot?
- Lf you must be so cynical.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.554
Oh, yeah. That one's a keeper.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.790
- So when do we do the retina scan?
- Friday.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.951
- I was joking.
- So was I.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.236
Good thing we didn't hire you
for your quick wit.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.118
Well, God doesn't give with two hands.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.998
Come on.
Time for you to meet your team.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.037
You'll have a researcher,
two paralegals...

06:21.200 --> 06:23.668
...and a file clerk to do
all the heavy lifting for you.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.070
Speaking of which,
let me show you our gym.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.073
- Oh, you guys have a gym?
- You didn't at the PD's office?

06:29.240 --> 06:30.878
Well, we had a basketball hoop.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.355
Everything's gonna be fine.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.039
It's just...

06:37.200 --> 06:40.829
...at Chino Hills,
you sort of showed up.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.037
No essays, interviews, tests.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.792
The Harbor School is one of
the best private schools in the country.

06:47.960 --> 06:51.191
If you graduate from here, you can
get into any college in the UC system.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.952
Maybe even an Ivy League.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.997
I don't think I'm an Ivy League
kind of guy.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.789
- After a year or two here, you will be.
- College, huh?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.188
Yeah.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.793
What did you get?

07:02.960 --> 07:06.430
AP History, English, calculus
and physics. And French 4.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.512
Good thing I don't have a life.
What is wrong? Are you nervous?

07:09.680 --> 07:12.752
Seth, would you please tell Ryan
that Dr. Kim is very nice.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.638
Oh, yeah. She is sweet.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.713
- Kirsten, how are you?
- Hi, nice to see you.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.997
Seth. Always interesting to see you.
And you must be Ryan.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.628
Why don't we step into my office.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.392
Well, this doesn't suck.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.551
That eloquence will serve you nicely
on the stand.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.711
Like you guys ever actually
go to trial.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.190
You're one of us now, Sandy.
Better start wrapping your head around it.

07:35.960 --> 07:39.032
So is your family all excited
about your first day?

07:39.200 --> 07:41.589
My wife loves being married
to a corporate sellout.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.317
Right, right, right.
Wrapping my head around it.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.950
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Yeah.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.758
I figured you'd wanna dive right in.

07:50.920 --> 07:55.232
Chemical peel gone awry. Fascinating.
Bad Botox injection.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.118
Noise complaint on a yacht.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.192
- Scintillating?
- In the purest sense of the word.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.794
- Don't be a snob.
- Just defend them. Right.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.473
Rich people need lawyers too.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.917
Weak grades, truancy.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.833
Notation regarding some criminal activity.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.389
It was a misdemeanor. Probation.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.915
Nonetheless, not exactly
Harbor School material.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.631
Dr. Kim, Ryan's had a lot to overcome...

08:17.800 --> 08:22.430
...but Sandy and I feel that in the right
environment, he could really excel.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.070
There's no doubt that Mr. Atwood
has extraordinary promise.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.198
I'm just concerned that he hasn't had...

08:29.360 --> 08:32.033
...adequate preparation
for the rigors of our curriculum.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.998
Or are you concerned about
the pressure from parents...

08:35.159 --> 08:36.388
...who don't want Ryan here?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.788
That's definitely a consideration.
But not a decisive one.

08:41.960 --> 08:46.112
Kirsten, you know as well as I do how
bright and motivated our students are.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.592
Those that aren't bred for USC
go off to Harvard and Yale.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.035
I just think a place like Newport Union...

08:53.200 --> 08:56.192
...might be a better fit for a student
with Ryan's background.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.112
My background?

08:59.320 --> 09:02.676
I can't change where I'm from,
but I can change where I'm going.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.479
Ryan, you understand
that if you did fail...

09:05.640 --> 09:07.915
...you'd lose a year,
not to mention self-confidence.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.991
With all due respect, Dr. Kim...

09:10.160 --> 09:13.948
...if you think not letting me in
is gonna inspire self-confidence...

09:14.880 --> 09:16.677
Give me a shot.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.630
You got great test scores.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.315
I definitely responded
to your personal essay.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.517
Your grades are borderline,
but acceptable.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.031
If you could pass a placement exam...

09:31.200 --> 09:34.112
It's not an aptitude test.
It measures your preparedness...

09:34.280 --> 09:35.838
...not how bright you are.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.956
Just tell me where and when.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.430
Summer, hey.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.828
Hi.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.317
It's so weird being in school right now...

09:56.560 --> 10:00.473
...surrounded by all these people
who have, like, no idea.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.200
I know. Have you talked to Marissa?

10:03.960 --> 10:05.791
I spoke to her mom. You?

10:05.960 --> 10:08.713
We went by this morning,
but she was sleeping.

10:09.560 --> 10:13.599
- They said she's gonna be okay, though.
- I still can't believe it, you know?

10:14.600 --> 10:16.989
- I thought she was dead.
- Me too.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.789
Maybe when she's feeling better, we'll
take her out and try and cheer her up.

10:23.960 --> 10:27.953
Take her to a movie.
Or Six Flags, I don't know.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.793
Yeah. I guess.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.068
Maybe before then, if you want...

10:36.240 --> 10:39.994
...I don't know, you and me could
go see a movie or something.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.596
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, Summer, how's it going?

10:42.760 --> 10:44.193
Hey, you guys.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.151
What a nerd.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.991
Look, Cohen.
This year's all messed up.

10:53.160 --> 10:58.359
I mean, Marissa's in the hospital,
I'll never speak to Luke or Holly again.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.431
- You and I...
- No, I get it, it's fine.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.034
We're back in school now,
old rules apply.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.512
Sorry.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.631
Strong sedative, huh?

11:17.800 --> 11:19.916
Yeah, she needs to sleep.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.916
And we need to talk.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.878
Look, Jimmy...

11:28.640 --> 11:31.393
...you and I, we need to
present a united front.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.438
It's hard enough, this forcing us
to be in the same room together.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.511
Thanks. You got a great bedside manner.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.194
Calling the Cohens was
completely inappropriate.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.476
- You know I don't like that Brian.
- Ryan.

11:41.640 --> 11:45.918
- I don't want him near Marissa.
- Marissa said it was an accident, okay?

11:46.080 --> 11:47.399
There's no one to blame.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.711
That's a convenient position to take,
since you let her go to Tijuana.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.599
Oh, so now it's my fault.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.557
You're the one
who destroyed this family.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.792
You lied to us. You stole money
from your clients and friends.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.996
Why do you think
she took all those pills?

12:02.440 --> 12:04.829
You cannot honestly believe that.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.471
I left her in your care for one weekend
and look what happened.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.949
Which is why I'm asking the judge
for sole custody.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.116
Julie, come on. You can't.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.478
Getting the girls away from you is my only
chance to give them a semblance of a life.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.039
And if you fight me on this...

12:24.200 --> 12:27.749
...I'll take you to court and you'll be lucky
to even get supervised visitation.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.390
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to,
because I am not giving up my kids.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.516
You may not have a choice.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.112
I'm going back to check on
Kaitlin and the sitter.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.953
You should get cleaned up.
You're a wreck.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.358
Good thing I never
throw anything away.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.590
The questions will be different,
but you get it.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.629
- Yeah, but I'm gonna fail.
- You're not gonna fail. You have to get in.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.870
I won't spend another year
at that school alone.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.076
Please, thank you, study.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.709
Especially, though, if all it takes is
a couple of cheerleaders walking by...

13:11.880 --> 13:15.350
...and suddenly it's like Summer and I,
we just didn't happen.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.279
I'm sorry. You study.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.593
Here's the thing, though.
We connected. And it was awesome.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.830
Especially the part
where she kissed me...

13:26.000 --> 13:28.309
Seth. I have two hours
until I take this test.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.357
Unless you plan on going to
Newport Union...

13:30.520 --> 13:32.829
Right. Got it.
Less talking, more studying.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.515
Don't move. I'm gonna get that.
And you keep studying.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.878
Hello?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.713
Hey, Marissa. Hi.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.677
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Sure.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.077
Hi.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.792
Okay. All right.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.678
Okay, I'll be there. Bye.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.754
She's upset.
Something with her parents.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.399
And her mom's going home, so...

14:04.560 --> 14:06.073
- What about the test?
- I'll be there.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.755
- I'll just do the best that I can.
- But what if that's not good enough?

14:09.920 --> 14:13.754
Well, then Dr. Kim was right.
I'm not Harbor School material.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.431
Hi.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.117
Hi.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.478
These are for you.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.631
It's all they had left at the gift shop.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.279
I'll just...

14:42.440 --> 14:44.396
I'm sorry.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.709
I was so dumb.
What I did, I wasn't...

14:48.880 --> 14:50.632
Hey, come on.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.433
I didn't want to kill myself.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.998
I didn't.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.431
I just wanted to...

15:02.960 --> 15:04.393
...escape.
- I know.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.196
Excuse me, nurse.
When you get a chance, lunch, please.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.793
You should...

15:15.680 --> 15:17.671
Oh, sweetie, you're awake.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.400
How are you feeling?
Your sister sends her love.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.993
My throat hurts.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.594
That's because they had to
pump your stomach, honey.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.230
Where did that thing come from?

15:28.680 --> 15:29.999
I...

15:30.520 --> 15:32.078
I don't know.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.357
It's from him. He came here, didn't he?
After I told him not to.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.034
- After everything he's done to you.
- He didn't.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.511
- It wasn't his fault.
- You keep saying that...

15:42.680 --> 15:46.116
...but before he got here,
you were happy.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.679
You think I was happy?

15:47.840 --> 15:49.432
If you weren't,
you never told me about it.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.591
- I tried, but...
- I need to talk to the nurse.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.228
The security in here is appalling.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.954
I'm sorry about that.
You know, about her.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.350
That's okay.
I should go and take this test.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.317
But I'll be back first chance I get.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.677
I don't know. With my mom...

16:09.840 --> 16:11.512
I'm not afraid of your mom.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.276
Well, I am.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.190
Did you ask Ryan
what he wants for lunch?

16:21.360 --> 16:22.952
He doesn't wanna eat.
He's on a diet.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.591
Why's he on a diet?

16:25.840 --> 16:29.515
- Why is he on a diet?
- I'll ask him. I wanna see how he's doing...

16:29.680 --> 16:35.277
Mom, Mom. He's in a state of deep, deep
Zen-like concentration right now, okay?

16:35.440 --> 16:36.668
Well, he still needs to eat.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.990
He's naked. All right? He's naked,
he studies in the nude. It's a Chino thing.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.709
I think that if you were to walk in on him
naked and Dad was to find out...

16:44.880 --> 16:46.950
...I think suspicions might be raised.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.111
A house divided will not stand.

16:50.440 --> 16:53.671
You and I still need to talk about
your little surprise trip to Tijuana.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.070
Okay. I can't wait.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.629
Jimmy, hi. Is Marissa okay?

16:58.800 --> 17:01.473
Yeah, she's doing better, thanks.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.358
It's Julie who's giving me the problem.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.954
Is Sandy coming home for lunch?

17:06.119 --> 17:09.031
No, he just started a new job today.
Why? What's going on?

17:09.200 --> 17:13.637
She's suing me for sole custody.
Maybe even supervised visits.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.712
- Why would she do that?
- Well, my question is, can she?

17:16.880 --> 17:19.109
I need to know what shot I have
at joint custody...

17:19.280 --> 17:21.430
...given what I've put my family through.

17:21.839 --> 17:25.355
- I wanna know what kind of case she has.
- Come in. I'll get Sandy's new number.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.838
I'll just... I'll wait out here.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.274
I mean, you know...

17:31.840 --> 17:37.039
Jimmy, we have been friends for too long
to let something like this...

17:39.040 --> 17:40.393
It was just a...

17:40.560 --> 17:45.076
It was stupid.
It was monumentally stupid.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.958
And I'm sorry.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.473
It's okay.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.757
I mean, it's not okay, but it's okay.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.957
I mean, you and Sandy are
the only friends I have left.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.350
- And I definitely don't wanna lose you.
- Won't.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.113
So are you coming in or what?

18:02.560 --> 18:07.554
<i>Hi, you've reached Jimmy Cooper.</i>
<i>Please leave a message and I'll get back</i>...

18:10.000 --> 18:12.958
Security said they'd do what they can,
but I don't know.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.556
You know, this is exactly why I thought
San Diego would be good for you.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.950
- San Diego?
- Dr. Burke has a facility there.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.998
- Who's Dr. Burke?
- Well...

18:22.160 --> 18:24.674
She's a psychiatrist.
Highly recommended.

18:24.840 --> 18:28.389
She runs an institute
for young women who are troubled.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.436
You're sending me
to a mental institution.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.913
It's a recovery center.

18:35.840 --> 18:39.753
Honey, I know you don't understand...

18:39.920 --> 18:43.629
...but I would rather have you hate me
now than risk losing you again.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.234
Does Dad know about this?

18:46.400 --> 18:49.836
Well, I think some time away from
your father would be good for you too.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.629
- Well, what if I don't wanna go?
- That's for Dr. Burke to decide.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.230
She'll be here after lunch
to evaluate you.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.073
Please, honey, just talk to her.
Let her help you.

18:59.520 --> 19:03.069
And then we can get you out of here
and you can start to get better.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.357
Yeah. If it's okay,
I just need to use the bathroom.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.839
Of course.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.716
Not now, Mom. I'm studying naked.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.753
Summer?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.634
- Come in.
- No way.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.030
- I'm not naked.
- No, no, no!

19:42.000 --> 19:45.629
Okay. I don't get it.
What kind of family do you have, Cohen?

19:45.800 --> 19:48.189
The kind where mothers and sons
wear clothes.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.396
Always. Even in the shower.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.110
What is this?

19:55.280 --> 19:57.271
I don't know.
I've never seen it before.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.749
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.275
Captain Oats. What are you doing here?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.316
Coop just called. She's freaking out.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.914
Her mom's threatening to ship her
to the insane asylum.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.311
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm serious.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.994
I've gotta do something, Cohen.
I need to get radical.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.393
- I need Ryan.
- You can't have him.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.597
He's taking an exam. What's wrong
with me, not radical enough?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.718
Well, that depends.
Are you ready to take on Julie Cooper?

20:24.040 --> 20:25.837
- We need Ryan.
- Yeah.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.595
- That's my bed.
- Okay.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.352
Just wanted you to know.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.719
- I have a feeling you'll be...
- Okay, let's go.

20:33.320 --> 20:36.949
It's a very fair offer,
given the merits of the case.

20:37.480 --> 20:40.950
Okay. Well, think it over.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.348
Goodbye.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.353
My wife does that with her hands
when she's pissed off at me.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.995
Your wife and I have a lot in common.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.479
You've been here half a day...

20:49.640 --> 20:53.030
...and you've booked
court dates for five of your seven cases.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.918
Do I win the free set of steak knives?

20:55.080 --> 20:57.674
Sandy, this isn't how
they do things around here.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.037
And I can keep this off the partners'
radar, but you gotta understand...

21:01.200 --> 21:05.079
Understand what? I'm going to court. I'm
taking them on, I'm bringing them down.

21:05.240 --> 21:10.473
Especially this bastard who won't let his
neighbor grow hedges over his own fence.

21:10.640 --> 21:14.918
Look, you know how much time
and energy goes into trying one of these.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.469
If you settled, you could handle
twice as many cases.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.359
- And we're in a volume business here.
- Like Costco.

21:21.520 --> 21:26.355
I thought the reason you brought me here
is because you wanted a trial attorney...

21:26.520 --> 21:28.476
...who's committed and passionate and...

21:28.640 --> 21:32.235
Yes. And when one of these cases
actually deserves to go before a jury...

21:32.400 --> 21:35.153
...the courtroom is all yours.
But in the meantime...

21:35.320 --> 21:39.632
...I need you to pick up the phone and
passionately negotiate some settlements.

21:39.800 --> 21:44.316
Come on. I put my ass on the line
to get you this gig.

21:44.480 --> 21:47.517
Please. Do it for me.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.914
Hey.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.991
What are you doing?
Dr. Kim will be back any minute.

21:54.160 --> 21:57.675
Yeah, I know this isn't the best time,
but Marissa needs you right now. Or us.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.400
Her mom's gone psycho.
She's having her committed.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.312
- What is going on in here?
- Hi, Dr. Kim.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.596
This isn't what it looks like.
It's an emergency.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.432
We need to borrow Ryan for a while.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.512
- He's not going anywhere. You two, out!
- You don't understand!

22:09.680 --> 22:11.750
- There's an emergency...
- Goodbye!

22:11.920 --> 22:14.514
Okay. We'll be out here.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.478
Actually, I gotta go too.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.200
- Have you finished the test?
- No. But I...

22:21.360 --> 22:25.035
Ryan, if this is too difficult, tell me.
If the Cohens are pressuring you...

22:25.200 --> 22:27.509
- They're not. I wanna be here.
- Then prove it.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.955
- Sit down, finish the test.
- I can't.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.556
Ryan, if this is the level of commitment
you plan to bring to your studies...

22:33.720 --> 22:36.712
- Dr. Kim, I really don't have time to argue.
- There is no argument.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.758
You walk away from this test,
you walk away from this school.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.117
You're probably right.
It wouldn't have worked out anyway.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.793
Sorry for wasting your time.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.311
Let's go.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.391
So your mother tells me you struggled
with anorexia in the ninth grade.

22:57.560 --> 23:00.711
My mom's convinced it was anorexia.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.674
It was just tennis season,
I was really stressed.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.793
That's all.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.835
And in 10th grade
you were caught shoplifting?

23:11.560 --> 23:14.199
It was just a lighter
and a pack of cigarettes.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.112
Do you still smoke?

23:16.840 --> 23:18.512
Not really.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.838
Drink?

23:23.200 --> 23:25.236
Would you say you drink a lot?

23:25.920 --> 23:28.434
I guess. I mean, what's a lot?

23:28.600 --> 23:31.831
Have you ever had so much to drink
that you blacked out?

23:36.720 --> 23:38.517
Tell me about this past year.

23:38.680 --> 23:42.832
Your dad's legal troubles,
bankruptcy, your parents separating.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.636
Home's probably the last place
you wanna be, right?

23:54.040 --> 23:56.713
Your mom mentioned a boyfriend. Luke?

23:58.160 --> 24:01.994
- He's not my boyfriend anymore.
- Really?

24:02.680 --> 24:04.875
You wanna tell me what happened?

24:05.680 --> 24:08.433
Anything I say, you'll just use against me
to prove to my mom...

24:08.600 --> 24:10.909
...that I'm troubled, right?

24:11.080 --> 24:14.675
I'm not here to judge.
I'm here to listen and try to help.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.037
You're here because my mom
would rather ship me to an institution...

24:19.200 --> 24:21.031
...than deal with what's really going on.

24:21.200 --> 24:25.034
I'm here because, accidentally or not,
you nearly killed yourself.

24:28.080 --> 24:32.596
And you wanna tell me what's actually
going on with you and your mom?

24:36.840 --> 24:38.592
How much time do you have?

24:42.840 --> 24:44.751
Not good. Summer should've
been here by now.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.751
She better be here soon.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.993
What if something happened? Right?

24:49.160 --> 24:52.152
Marissa's dad can't even get her
out of here. How are we supposed to?

24:52.320 --> 24:53.878
Not by waiting for Summer.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.156
Hi. We're here for Marissa Cooper.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.834
It's okay, Denise. They're with me.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.117
Good Lord.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.396
What? I told you I was a candy striper.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.916
- I thought you were kidding.
- It's for charity. All the girls do it.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.674
- I should be hospitalized more.
- Lf you need any help...

25:10.840 --> 25:13.195
Okay, guys. Can you get us
in the psych ward or not?

25:13.360 --> 25:16.113
- Just try to keep up with me.
- Cool.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.157
Seth, you're on lookout.

25:18.320 --> 25:21.995
Hi, Gloria. I know it's my day off, but
I just cannot get enough of sick people.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.116
These guys are helping
with the sponge baths.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.430
Dibs on that guy.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.875
We don't need to keep her
on suicide watch...

25:29.040 --> 25:31.998
...but there are underlying issues
she hasn't been dealing with.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.469
- But you can help her?
- I can recommend treatment.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.598
- Psychodynamic therapy, group work.
- At the institute?

25:37.760 --> 25:41.230
At the institute or here in Newport.
I see patients, or I can refer you.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.551
No. I want her to get out of Newport.
It's too chaotic for her here.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.188
She can't leave now.
She's got school, her friends.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.191
Uprooting her will do
more harm than good.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.794
She almost died, Jimmy.
How much more harm can she do?

25:53.080 --> 25:56.152
All right, you decide.
I need to check in with the institute.

25:56.560 --> 25:57.959
Thanks.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.388
- She's going to the institute.
- She's not going anywhere.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.632
- Don't make me call my lawyer.
- Go ahead. I'll call mine.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.917
I'm gonna go talk to Marissa.

26:11.680 --> 26:15.559
Excuse me, doctor.
Marissa's father and I have discussed it.

26:15.720 --> 26:19.759
I've got a bag for her in the car
and I can drive her down myself tonight.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.831
I'll make the arrangements.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.753
Thank you.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.594
I know this may be difficult
for you to hear...

26:28.760 --> 26:31.228
...but Dr. Burke and I think
it's for the best.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.308
Well, what about Dad?

26:33.480 --> 26:35.471
Well, he just wants
what's best for you too.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.712
Now, Dr. Burke and I
have some paperwork.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.440
So you should get dressed, okay?

26:42.160 --> 26:44.674
I'm glad you're taking this
so well, Marissa.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.149
Yeah, well, if it's for the best, right?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.436
I love you, honey.

26:50.320 --> 26:53.915
- Okay. Get dressed. I'll be back.
- All right.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.834
- How'd I do?
- Almost had me convinced. Here.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.191
It's Summer's idea. It's for cover.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.874
Sure. Summer's idea.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.634
Hey, no peeking.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.911
Hey, <i>Madame Bovary</i>.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.434
That Flaubert could really turn a phrase.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.716
I guess. It was kind of a bummer.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.110
I know Emma got her heart,
like, totally broken...

27:38.280 --> 27:40.430
...but why'd she have to
go and eat arsenic?

27:40.600 --> 27:42.830
- You've read <i>Madame Bovary</i> ?
- Five times.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.911
It's Tom Shayle's favorite book.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.311
I should go check on him. He's two
floors down. He's, like, incontinent.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.914
You're a strange and mysterious
woman, Summer.

27:51.080 --> 27:54.038
The most important thing is that
we make sure Marissa feels safe.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.113
I don't know what that means, Cohen.
I wasn't in Panama.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.669
- It means...
- Just go and I'll run interference.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.035
Yeah, that's what I said. 10-4.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.755
- Hi, Mrs. Cooper. How are you?
- Hey, Summer. You here to see Mariss?

28:10.920 --> 28:14.549
Yeah. I was just volunteering today,
I thought I'd stop by. How is she?

28:14.720 --> 28:17.234
Well, she's going to be fine eventually.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.790
- Are you her doctor?
- Therapist. We're on our way to see her...

28:20.960 --> 28:24.350
Therapist? Do you have a second?
Because I keep having this dream.

28:24.520 --> 28:28.832
I'm in the woods, trying to find this
restaurant, but I'm lost and so hungry.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.230
I have a reservation, can't be late.
You following?

28:32.160 --> 28:34.037
You ready?

28:35.920 --> 28:37.273
Yeah.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.114
Go away.

28:44.280 --> 28:47.431
I just wanted to see you.
I'm so sorry about everything.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.239
- Yeah, that's what you said in Mexico.
- That was a mistake.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.628
No kidding.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.791
What are you doing dressed like that?

28:56.160 --> 28:58.754
Hey, your mom and the doctor
are on the move.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.552
You're running away?

29:05.600 --> 29:07.352
Look, Luke, please, l...

29:08.720 --> 29:10.756
Take the stairs.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.235
Are you sure it's okay?
I don't wanna interrupt.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.437
His office said he was having
welcome drinks with a few of his...

29:24.600 --> 29:25.919
Thank you.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.672
Associates.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.877
- Can I have another one?
- Sure.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.593
Hey!

29:37.440 --> 29:39.237
Hey. What are you two doing here?

29:40.360 --> 29:44.751
When I couldn't reach you, I called the
office. Jimmy needs some legal advice.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.994
- I'm Kirsten.
- Hi, I'm Rachel.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.435
- Oh, so this is Rachel.
- This is Rachel.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.431
I'm Rachel.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.513
- Hi, Rachel. I'm Jimmy.
- Hi.

29:59.520 --> 30:02.512
So are you suing a tequila company?
Doing some research?

30:02.680 --> 30:06.229
- Apparently, we don't sue anybody.
- Now, you say that like it's a bad thing.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.832
Kirsten, you're lucky to be married
to somebody so hilarious.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.351
I am.

30:15.960 --> 30:19.236
You know what, I'll just take care
of this myself. I'm gonna go.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.118
- Jimmy.
- Stop by the office tomorrow.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.875
Yeah, no, tomorrow's gonna be too late.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.632
Thanks, Kirsten.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.878
I'll see you at home,
when you've finished work.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.474
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.517
Hey, Dad.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.030
What are you doing here?

30:58.960 --> 31:00.632
I checked out.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.916
Does your mother know about this?

31:04.040 --> 31:08.477
- We're gonna wait in the car.
- Yeah. Yeah. Right.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.190
You ran away?

31:21.360 --> 31:24.750
- I didn't know what else to do.
- Sweetheart.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.639
Mom was getting ready to
drive me down to San Diego.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.199
What?

31:30.280 --> 31:32.919
What...? You didn't know.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.595
I should have guessed.

31:36.760 --> 31:40.196
Look, I don't want to go to San Diego
and I don't wanna live with Mom.

31:41.840 --> 31:45.230
- I wanna stay with you.
- Look, I want that too. Okay?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.868
But I don't know if that's possible.

31:48.040 --> 31:51.271
Your mom is suing me for sole custody.

31:51.440 --> 31:56.195
And after everything I've done,
she kind of has me over a barrel, kiddo.

31:57.480 --> 32:02.952
Look, if I do even the slightest thing
wrong, I could never see you again.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.756
Okay?
And I don't ever want to lose you.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.358
Hold on.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.713
- Just give me a second, okay?
- Yeah.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.713
Hey. Yeah, hi.

32:22.360 --> 32:25.079
No. She's here.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.674
Look, I didn't have anything
to do with this, Julie.

32:27.840 --> 32:32.231
Well, you were gonna take her to
San Diego without telling me about it.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.109
All right. I'll keep her here.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.351
What do you wanna do now, Coop?

32:42.520 --> 32:45.637
I don't know what to do.
What can I do?

32:45.800 --> 32:48.553
I could hide you in one
of my mom's developments.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.268
I'm kidding.

32:53.120 --> 32:55.270
I mean, how is any of this even possible?

32:55.440 --> 32:57.032
My mom wants to lock me up
in an asylum...

32:57.200 --> 32:59.270
...while my dad can't do anything
about it.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.874
- We'll figure something out.
- Well, we better hurry.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.713
She just escaped from a psych ward
in a candy striper outfit.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.519
If they didn't think
she was crazy before, they...

33:07.680 --> 33:10.990
- Sorry, Coop. I'm gonna get another slice.
- As will I.

33:15.840 --> 33:19.469
Well, if you wanna skip town,
I guess I could go with you.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.517
My mom would love that.

33:21.680 --> 33:25.070
Look, if your mom's doing all this
just to keep me away from you...

33:25.240 --> 33:26.468
...I'll stay away.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.990
I don't want that.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.108
So, what are we gonna do?

33:41.880 --> 33:44.872
If I could just get her to listen.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.431
- Hey.
- Back from work?

34:04.600 --> 34:06.318
I don't understand why you're so upset.

34:06.480 --> 34:09.790
I mean, I understand, but it's nothing.
She works at the firm.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.190
She doesn't look old enough
to be served in a bar.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.715
She's 33. She graduated Berkeley
four years after you.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.710
- What's her favorite color?
- Pink.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.195
Oh, Kirsten.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.793
Sandy, I'm not saying
anything's going on.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.713
Good, because you spent the weekend
painting Jimmy's house...

34:26.880 --> 34:30.589
...and I said nothing,
because I knew nothing was going on.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.835
- Right?
- Right, of course.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.911
So, what were you two
doing together tonight?

34:36.080 --> 34:39.197
Jimmy's got custody issues with Julie.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.156
Well, I guess we're all having issues.

34:43.040 --> 34:47.397
So, what are we gonna do?
I have to work with this woman.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.993
- I trust you.
- Okay.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.313
- I trust you.
- Okay.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.078
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Ryan.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.878
Hey. What's going on?

35:05.440 --> 35:09.433
I'm with Marissa,
and I need your advice.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.394
Well, if I've learned anything today...

35:17.560 --> 35:19.869
...you don't wanna go to court
with this.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.156
You're gonna want to settle.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.276
- What is going on?
- Come with me.

35:31.080 --> 35:35.198
What does this have to do with Marissa?
Do you know where she...?

35:38.240 --> 35:41.789
Well, no surprise
you're involved in all this.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.871
Where is she?

35:44.040 --> 35:48.352
I don't know. At a bus station.
On a tropical island somewhere.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.273
I cannot believe
you're chaperoning this farce.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.432
- Julie, sit down.
- No. I don't want to sit down.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.989
All right, let's all talk.

35:57.160 --> 35:59.116
Talk about what?
What is there to talk about?

35:59.280 --> 36:02.158
Well, if you ever wanna
see your daughter...

36:02.320 --> 36:03.719
Watch it.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.790
Julie, I know you've been through a lot,
but Ryan isn't the problem.

36:11.320 --> 36:13.550
What is that supposed to mean?

36:13.720 --> 36:16.473
You tell me where she is
and then I am taking her home.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.155
- She just ran away from a hospital!
- She ran away from you.

36:21.960 --> 36:25.032
Look, you're from Riverside, right?

36:25.200 --> 36:27.350
Well, that's not too far
from where I grew up.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.714
I am calling the police...

36:28.880 --> 36:31.872
And I know this place has
everything we never had...

36:32.040 --> 36:34.634
...and I know you're afraid
you're gonna lose it all.

36:34.800 --> 36:35.789
I'm done.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.996
But you and Marissa
want different things.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.993
- You don't know what she wants!
- I know what she doesn't want.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.037
She doesn't want to go to San Diego.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.316
And she doesn't want to live with you.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.395
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say to any of this.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.152
Just say yes.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.675
Oh, honey.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.434
- No, no, you don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

37:03.240 --> 37:08.394
Look, I know you're only trying to help,
but you're just making everything worse.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.874
You have no idea how scared I was.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.317
I'm sorry.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.355
But, look, I'm not gonna hurt
myself again.

37:23.560 --> 37:28.350
And I'll even see a therapist if you want.
But I wanna do it here.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.433
And I wanna live with Dad.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.596
I mean, at least for now.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.959
This isn't over, Marissa.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.910
I'll let myself out.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.591
You okay?

38:19.000 --> 38:23.312
So you still think that,
after everything that happened today...

38:23.480 --> 38:26.472
...when we get back to school,
you're gonna be able to ignore me?

38:26.640 --> 38:30.792
- Well, all I can do is try.
- I admire your will.

38:32.480 --> 38:33.959
Hey!

38:34.120 --> 38:36.759
Hey. How'd it go?

38:36.920 --> 38:40.071
- Oh, it's over.
- Yeah?

38:40.240 --> 38:43.869
Somebody should take Marissa home.
To her dad's.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.277
Bye, Summer.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.312
It's just a little thing we do.

38:59.360 --> 39:03.558
Okay. Now, let's talk about
that surprise little trip to Tijuana.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.870
It's pronounced "Tijuana."
You're so white, Mom.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.750
- I've never heard you talk so much.
- I like to save it for when it counts.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.148
Good.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.356
So I heard what happened
with your test today.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.590
Or what didn't happen.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.870
You're suddenly not so talkative.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.792
Look, I get it.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.269
Marissa needed help,
you were worried about her.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.749
Believe me, I understand.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.831
I'm worried about you.

39:31.040 --> 39:34.635
I'm okay going to public school. It'd be
a hell of a lot better than where I went.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.270
- Go to Dr. Kim and explain yourself.
- I don't think she wants to hear from me.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.032
Ever again.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.799
You're afraid of her.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.516
You, who went toe-to-toe
with Julie Cooper, the dragon lady.

39:46.680 --> 39:50.593
You can take Dr. Kim. Talk to her.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.433
If there's a problem,
you'll have your attorney present.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.037
I got your back.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.868
Now, you and Summer seemed
pretty chummy yesterday.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.076
Dad, "chummy"?

40:04.160 --> 40:06.594
- It's okay, you can tell me.
- No, really, I can't.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.079
If you can't tell your dad,
who can you tell?

40:08.240 --> 40:13.075
Gee, I don't know. Ryan, Mom.
That tree over there.

40:13.320 --> 40:16.471
- You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
- When are you leaving?

40:24.360 --> 40:26.794
- What's the verdict?
- He passed. He did very well.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.634
Congratulations! Dude, you're a Pirate.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.916
- You guys are the Pirates?
- Yeah, it's a bit minty.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.275
Thank you for giving Ryan
another chance.

40:34.440 --> 40:38.718
Mr. Cohen, I told Ryan that if he ever
pulls a stunt like that again...

40:38.880 --> 40:41.952
...he's going to need a much better
lawyer than you to get him out.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.278
Welcome to the Harbor School, Ryan.
I'll be watching you.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.114
You thought juvie was tough.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.555
You ready to get your photo taken
for a student ID?

40:56.720 --> 40:58.631
- Another mug shot?
- So cynical.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.314
Hey. Check out my new mug shot.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.552
God! Dad, those eyebrows
are out of control.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.119
It's a sign of power, you know.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.669
Then you must be the most
powerful man in the world.

41:08.840 --> 41:11.354
Yeah, well, brace yourself, son.
It's genetic.
