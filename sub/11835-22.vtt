WEBVTT

00:03.196 --> 00:04.564
Okay. Standby for Larry.

00:05.399 --> 00:08.602
Three, two, one.

00:08.635 --> 00:10.871
Tonight, high courtroom drama.

00:10.904 --> 00:13.073
With us now in Boston
is Ellenor Frutt,

00:13.106 --> 00:15.342
attorney for Lindsay Dole.

00:15.376 --> 00:16.510
Good evening, Larry.

00:16.543 --> 00:19.480
<i>Ms. Frutt, your client</i>
<i>shoots a former client,</i>

00:19.513 --> 00:22.416
and she's raised
battered woman syndrome

00:22.449 --> 00:23.750
as a defense?

00:23.784 --> 00:24.685
FRUTT: That's correct.

00:24.718 --> 00:25.986
We typically think

00:26.019 --> 00:27.988
of a battered woman as a wife,

00:28.021 --> 00:30.090
with the batterer
being the husband,

00:30.123 --> 00:32.092
but the syndrome
is not confined

00:32.125 --> 00:33.560
to domestic relationships.

00:33.594 --> 00:36.062
Okay, but how
did Lawrence O'Malley

00:36.096 --> 00:37.230
batter her?

00:37.264 --> 00:38.565
<i>FRUTT: Well, without getting</i>
<i>into the details</i>

00:38.599 --> 00:41.234
of our defense,
he threatened to kill her.

00:41.268 --> 00:44.104
My client was in reasonable
fear for her life

00:44.137 --> 00:46.006
at the time Mr. O'Malley
showed up.

00:46.039 --> 00:49.410
And this is different
from self-defense, how?

00:49.443 --> 00:52.979
Self-defense would be
an objective standard.

00:53.013 --> 00:54.848
Was it reasonable
for the defendant

00:54.881 --> 00:56.182
to use deadly force?

00:56.216 --> 00:59.520
Here, it's more
of a subjective test.

00:59.553 --> 01:01.955
Was it reasonable
for Lindsay Dole,

01:01.988 --> 01:04.858
in her particular mental state,
to use force?

01:04.891 --> 01:07.794
And this is where battered
woman syndrome applies.

01:07.828 --> 01:10.931
No love lost between you
and the district attorney.

01:11.565 --> 01:13.434
Kenneth Walsh
is a fine prosecutor,

01:13.467 --> 01:16.270
but he typically lets
his thirst for vengeance

01:16.303 --> 01:18.739
color his actions,
and he's doing so here.

01:21.908 --> 01:24.278
It's a deliberate attempt
to contaminate the jury.

01:24.311 --> 01:26.413
I want her gagged
right now.

01:26.447 --> 01:28.749
Let's add free speech
to the list of things you hate.

01:28.782 --> 01:30.617
That wasn't free speech,
Ellenor.

01:30.651 --> 01:33.787
WEST: Let's wipe some
of the foam off your mouth.

01:33.820 --> 01:35.489
She attacked me personally,
Your Honor.

01:35.522 --> 01:38.392
If you feel libeled,
I suggest you sue me.

01:38.425 --> 01:41.428
WEST: This is not starting
off well.

01:42.195 --> 01:44.965
Mr. Walsh, I am loathe
to issue gag orders

01:44.998 --> 01:47.834
and if I might share
with you an inside tip,

01:47.868 --> 01:49.536
the book on you is,

01:49.570 --> 01:52.238
you're less effective
in the room when angry,

01:52.273 --> 01:54.240
and I would guess Ms. Frutt
is attempting

01:54.275 --> 01:56.443
to get you in that state.

01:56.477 --> 01:57.678
And you might be best served

01:57.711 --> 02:00.213
by ignoring
her out-of-court antics.

02:00.246 --> 02:01.982
WALSH: When those antics
are for the purpose

02:02.015 --> 02:03.317
of influencing the jury.

02:03.350 --> 02:05.819
WEST: I will watch the tape

02:05.852 --> 02:08.689
and decide if she went too far.

02:09.889 --> 02:11.658
Now, as a warning
to both of you,

02:11.692 --> 02:13.259
keep it professional.

02:21.435 --> 02:23.103
You know, I'm tired
of your piss-ass crap.

02:23.136 --> 02:25.306
I'm tired of your
firm's piss-ass crap.

02:25.339 --> 02:26.907
You made a big mistake,
Ellenor,

02:26.940 --> 02:28.208
and your client's
gonna pay for it

02:28.241 --> 02:30.644
for the rest of her life,
you piss-ass,

02:30.677 --> 02:32.579
scum-crap dirt bastard.

02:34.448 --> 02:35.782
You seem mad.

02:37.918 --> 02:43.290
(music playing)

03:27.268 --> 03:28.569
Thanks.

03:28.602 --> 03:30.871
We've got a problem.
What?

03:30.904 --> 03:32.739
Walsh just filed
a last-minute motion.

03:32.773 --> 03:34.575
He wants an unavailable
witness instruction

03:34.608 --> 03:36.042
given to the jury.

03:36.076 --> 03:37.811
Who's the unavailable
witness?

03:37.844 --> 03:38.945
Bobby.

03:42.182 --> 03:44.685
We have to prove guilt
beyond all reasonable doubt.

03:44.718 --> 03:45.752
That's our burden.

03:45.786 --> 03:47.488
And certainly,
Bobby Donnell has the right

03:47.521 --> 03:50.691
not to testify,
but if he exercises that right,

03:50.724 --> 03:53.394
the jury should know
it's not the prosecution's fault

03:53.427 --> 03:55.629
for failing to produce
a single witness.

03:55.662 --> 03:56.763
That's not what
he's trying to do.

03:56.797 --> 03:58.399
He's waving a flag for the jury.

03:58.432 --> 04:00.166
"Hey, Bobby Donnell's
not talking.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.468
He must be hiding something."

04:02.068 --> 04:04.204
What's your proposed
instruction, Mr. Walsh?

04:05.706 --> 04:08.174
"Mr. Donnell was present
during the shooting.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.744
The defense,
but not the prosecution,

04:10.777 --> 04:12.546
could have called Mr. Donnell
as a witness.

04:12.579 --> 04:14.481
They did not do so.

04:14.515 --> 04:17.651
You may infer that,
had Mr. Donnell been called,

04:17.684 --> 04:21.221
he would've given testimony
unfavorable to Ms. Dole."

04:21.254 --> 04:22.456
That is outrageous.

04:22.489 --> 04:24.425
It renders spousal privilege
meaningless.

04:24.458 --> 04:26.059
Mr. Young--
He brought this motion

04:26.092 --> 04:27.093
for them, the media.

04:27.127 --> 04:28.862
He wants it in print
that Bobby Donnell

04:28.895 --> 04:29.896
had something to hide.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.164
If I wanted to talk
to the media,

04:31.197 --> 04:32.899
I would've went right
to the morning news shows,

04:32.933 --> 04:33.700
like you people.

04:33.734 --> 04:35.235
All right.

04:37.137 --> 04:39.306
Mr. Young, Bobby Donnell

04:39.340 --> 04:41.041
is on your witness list.

04:41.074 --> 04:43.844
If you plan to call him,
this motion is moot.

04:43.877 --> 04:46.547
We shouldn't have to declare
our hand now.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.248
It's our right to call him.

04:48.282 --> 04:50.150
It's our right not to.

04:50.183 --> 04:52.252
You're not the only one
with rights.

04:52.286 --> 04:55.255
Bobby Donnell was the only
one in the room.

04:55.289 --> 04:57.724
If he doesn't want
to testify, fine.

04:57.758 --> 04:59.626
But the jury shouldn't punish
the Commonwealth

04:59.660 --> 05:00.994
for his unavailability.

05:03.530 --> 05:05.266
Mr. Walsh,
your motion is denied.

05:05.732 --> 05:07.501
We are adjourned until 1:00,

05:07.534 --> 05:09.903
at which point,
trial will start.

05:09.936 --> 05:11.738
Come back here with evidence.

05:11.772 --> 05:14.007
Leave the nonsense
at the door.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.676
(gavel bangs)

05:15.709 --> 05:18.779
Both sides are expected
to open today.

05:18.812 --> 05:20.281
Tomorrow, the prosecution

05:20.314 --> 05:21.915
will call its first witness.

05:25.719 --> 05:26.720
We're set?

05:27.187 --> 05:27.921
Okay.

05:28.822 --> 05:29.756
YOUNG: Bobby,
something to think about,

05:29.790 --> 05:31.592
the motion they just brought?

05:31.625 --> 05:33.259
It may have been
just for the press,

05:33.294 --> 05:34.895
but Walsh could've
had another motive.

05:35.629 --> 05:36.497
Which is?

05:36.530 --> 05:37.998
To force you to take
the stand.

05:38.632 --> 05:39.600
If they got that instruction,

05:39.633 --> 05:41.468
we would have no choice
but to call you,

05:41.502 --> 05:43.504
and it makes me nervous
that he wants you up there.

05:43.537 --> 05:46.507
Or he wants us to think
that so I don't testify.

05:46.540 --> 05:47.608
Shouldn't we go?

05:48.141 --> 05:50.143
I'm staying here
with Rebecca.

05:50.176 --> 05:51.244
You'll look more
sympathetic, Lindsay,

05:51.278 --> 05:52.045
without an army.

05:52.078 --> 05:53.347
We went over this, Eugene.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.482
I know, I'm just going
over it again.

05:55.516 --> 05:56.483
Why?

05:58.285 --> 06:00.921
Because I want so much
to be in that room,

06:00.954 --> 06:02.155
and I want you to know that.

06:07.928 --> 06:09.296
We all love you.

06:10.464 --> 06:12.165
Every one of us.

06:12.198 --> 06:13.967
And whether we're here

06:14.000 --> 06:15.536
or in there,

06:16.537 --> 06:17.771
we're with you.

06:24.411 --> 06:26.212
And we're ready for this.

06:32.085 --> 06:36.022
(indistinct shouting)

06:41.027 --> 06:43.530
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret,

06:44.431 --> 06:46.367
I'm glad Lawrence O'Malley

06:46.400 --> 06:48.168
took three in the chest.

06:49.270 --> 06:51.538
The man, as you'll hear,

06:51.572 --> 06:53.274
was an accused murderer.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.141
A cannibal.

06:56.343 --> 06:58.545
The politically correct
term for him

06:58.579 --> 07:00.681
would be "damaged,"

07:01.648 --> 07:03.284
and a part of me thinks
Lindsay Dole

07:03.317 --> 07:04.685
did us all a favor.

07:04.718 --> 07:07.053
I would've liked
to have shot him

07:08.221 --> 07:09.623
but I wouldn't have.

07:10.391 --> 07:12.025
Nor would any of you,

07:12.593 --> 07:15.896
because we have a law
against revenge killings.

07:15.929 --> 07:18.932
There are rules against
firing three bullets

07:18.965 --> 07:21.768
point-blank
into an unarmed man.

07:22.969 --> 07:24.705
It's called murder.

07:25.606 --> 07:27.808
The evidence will show
that the defendant

07:27.841 --> 07:31.412
executed Lawrence O'Malley,
simple as that.

07:31.445 --> 07:34.781
She just shot him dead
in cold blood.

07:35.549 --> 07:38.585
As viscerally satisfying
as that may be,

07:40.020 --> 07:43.557
this was first-degree homicide.

07:45.191 --> 07:46.760
It was murder.

08:01.675 --> 08:04.878
Lindsay Dole
doesn't even remember

08:04.911 --> 08:06.580
shooting Lawrence O'Malley.

08:06.613 --> 08:10.584
That moment
is completely blacked out,

08:10.617 --> 08:13.253
and the evidence will show

08:13.287 --> 08:16.122
that her brain
quite likely went black

08:16.156 --> 08:18.592
before she pulled the trigger.

08:19.660 --> 08:20.961
Three years ago,

08:20.994 --> 08:22.863
Lindsay Dole was stabbed

08:22.896 --> 08:26.467
three times by a client.

08:27.067 --> 08:29.536
She nearly died.

08:29.570 --> 08:33.640
Last year,
she was stalked and threatened

08:33.674 --> 08:37.278
by a serial killer
who was also a client.

08:37.878 --> 08:40.813
Here, after defending
Lawrence O'Malley

08:40.847 --> 08:42.448
from multiple killings,

08:42.482 --> 08:45.319
she was stalked by him.

08:45.352 --> 08:47.988
He threatened to kill her.

08:48.622 --> 08:50.757
He showed up at her door

08:50.791 --> 08:53.727
in violation
of a restraining order,

08:53.760 --> 08:57.764
entered her house,
and this time--this time,

08:57.798 --> 09:00.000
Lindsay snapped.

09:00.033 --> 09:02.803
All of those clients
came back into her head.

09:02.836 --> 09:06.039
They were all personified
by Lawrence O'Malley,

09:06.072 --> 09:08.942
standing in her house,
threatening to kill her,

09:08.975 --> 09:12.379
and this time she just snapped.

09:15.382 --> 09:16.517
By the way,

09:17.418 --> 09:19.119
if Lindsay hadn't snapped,

09:20.387 --> 09:21.988
she'd be dead now.

09:24.124 --> 09:25.559
No question.

09:45.879 --> 09:47.514
WALSH: You were representing
the victim.

09:47.548 --> 09:49.816
McGONIGAL: Yes.
The defendant was trying

09:49.850 --> 09:51.918
to have Mr. O'Malley
civilly committed.

09:51.952 --> 09:54.955
I was acting
as Mr. O'Malley's counsel.

09:54.988 --> 09:56.923
What was the disposition
of that motion?

09:56.957 --> 09:58.659
The petition was denied.

09:58.692 --> 10:00.861
Mr. O'Malley
was not committed.

10:00.894 --> 10:02.195
And Ms. McGonigal,

10:02.228 --> 10:04.331
what happened after
the judge made her ruling?

10:04.365 --> 10:07.601
Well, Ms. Dole was not happy
with the outcome.

10:07.634 --> 10:10.203
She then approached
Mr. O'Malley.

10:10.236 --> 10:12.373
Did she do
or say anything?

10:12.406 --> 10:14.441
Yes. She said to him,

10:14.475 --> 10:16.443
"Come near me, I'll kill you."

10:16.943 --> 10:18.779
WALSH: Were those
her exact words?

10:18.812 --> 10:21.448
Those were her exact words.

10:21.482 --> 10:22.583
WALSH: Thank you.

10:23.484 --> 10:25.619
You said my client

10:25.652 --> 10:28.322
brought the motion to have
Mr. O'Malley committed.

10:28.355 --> 10:29.556
Wasn't that motion brought

10:29.590 --> 10:31.358
by the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts?

10:31.392 --> 10:34.695
Your client is close friends
with Helen Gamble,

10:34.728 --> 10:35.796
a district attorney.

10:35.829 --> 10:37.664
Who brought the motion,
Ms. McGonigal?

10:37.698 --> 10:38.565
Lindsay Dole,

10:38.599 --> 10:40.534
or the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts?

10:40.567 --> 10:42.135
Technically, the state.

10:42.168 --> 10:44.471
Did Mr. Walsh ask you
to leave that part out?

10:44.505 --> 10:46.473
Objection.
WEST: Sustained.

10:46.507 --> 10:48.809
FRUTT: You testified
that my client

10:48.842 --> 10:51.211
was "not happy"
by the ruling.

10:51.244 --> 10:53.647
She was a little more
than "not happy,"

10:53.680 --> 10:54.715
wasn't she?
Well--

10:54.748 --> 10:56.149
FRUTT: She jumped up in court

10:56.182 --> 10:57.718
and called the judge crazy.

10:57.751 --> 10:59.553
Did you not hear that?
I heard it.

10:59.586 --> 11:01.488
FRUTT: As far as courtroom
decorum goes,

11:01.522 --> 11:02.923
she was out of control,
wasn't she?

11:02.956 --> 11:04.625
I'm not going to have you
put the words

11:04.658 --> 11:06.860
"out of control"
in my mouth, counsel.

11:06.893 --> 11:08.695
FRUTT: Did it get to a point
where the judge

11:08.729 --> 11:10.331
had to threaten
Ms. Dole with contempt?

11:10.364 --> 11:12.399
That's an interpretation.

11:12.433 --> 11:14.535
The judge never used
the word "contempt."

11:14.568 --> 11:16.136
I see.

11:16.169 --> 11:19.773
So, it would be
your interpretation

11:19.806 --> 11:21.908
that Lindsay
was "not happy"?

11:22.409 --> 11:25.011
Yes.
Thank you.

11:28.181 --> 11:28.949
By the way,

11:29.983 --> 11:33.086
in your opposition
to Mr. O'Malley's commitment,

11:33.119 --> 11:35.622
you argued that,
instead of incarceration,

11:35.656 --> 11:37.491
Mr. O'Malley
should receive treatment,

11:37.524 --> 11:39.225
did you not?
Yes.

11:39.259 --> 11:40.427
FRUTT:
And as one vested

11:40.461 --> 11:42.696
in safeguarding
his interests,

11:42.729 --> 11:44.130
did you take any steps

11:44.164 --> 11:45.999
to see to it
that he got that treatment?

11:46.032 --> 11:48.134
I was vested
in safeguarding

11:48.168 --> 11:49.870
his legal interests.

11:49.903 --> 11:51.738
FRUTT: You stood
before the court,

11:51.772 --> 11:53.774
opposed to his
being committed,

11:53.807 --> 11:56.610
said, "Let's get
him treatment,"

11:56.643 --> 11:59.012
and after the ruling,
you just said, "Goodbye,"

11:59.045 --> 12:01.081
doing nothing to help him
get the treatment?

12:02.048 --> 12:03.984
Is it because you really didn't
think he needed the treatment,

12:04.017 --> 12:05.952
or that you just
couldn't be bothered?

12:05.986 --> 12:07.521
Objection!
FRUTT: No, I am sorry,

12:07.554 --> 12:10.090
but I will not conceal
my disgust here.

12:10.123 --> 12:12.826
Mr. O'Malley might not be dead
had this witness

12:12.859 --> 12:13.894
done her job.
Objection!

12:13.927 --> 12:15.128
FRUTT: You kept him
on the street,

12:15.161 --> 12:16.397
you took your fee,

12:16.430 --> 12:17.898
and you did nothing!
Objection!

12:17.931 --> 12:19.232
Ms. Frutt!
FRUTT: Well, at least

12:19.266 --> 12:21.468
you make
for a great witness.

12:21.502 --> 12:22.803
WEST: Ms. Frutt,

12:22.836 --> 12:25.639
you are one remark away
from a jail cell.

12:25.672 --> 12:28.609
(music playing)

12:37.918 --> 12:39.052
Did I go too far?

12:39.520 --> 12:40.787
DONNELL: I don't think so.

12:40.821 --> 12:41.822
We had to pop her.

12:41.855 --> 12:42.823
She took a side,

12:42.856 --> 12:43.890
we had to pop her.

12:45.492 --> 12:46.327
Who's up next?

12:47.093 --> 12:48.829
They go to forensics now.

12:49.563 --> 12:50.864
ILLICH:
The blood-spatter evidence

12:50.897 --> 12:52.599
shows the victim
to be here,

12:52.633 --> 12:55.669
approximately 15 feet
from the shooter.

12:55.702 --> 12:57.237
Mr. Donnell
would've been here.

12:57.271 --> 12:58.439
WALSH:
you can tell that from...

12:58.472 --> 13:00.073
The blood-spatter
on his clothing.

13:00.106 --> 13:01.642
WALSH:
So, he would've been between

13:01.675 --> 13:02.843
the victim
and the defendant?

13:02.876 --> 13:04.010
Correct.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.579
Any blood
on Ms. Dole's clothing?

13:05.612 --> 13:07.548
ILLICH:
No, she was too far away.

13:07.581 --> 13:09.950
WALSH: And, Mr. Illich,
were you able to determine

13:09.983 --> 13:11.818
if Mr. O'Malley was moving

13:11.852 --> 13:12.953
at the time he was shot?

13:12.986 --> 13:15.356
He was either
standing still

13:15.389 --> 13:16.790
or moving backwards.

13:17.123 --> 13:18.459
WALSH:
How can you tell that, sir?

13:18.492 --> 13:19.993
ILLICH: The trajectory
of the wounds.

13:20.026 --> 13:24.030
Also, if he'd been
moving forward at all,

13:24.064 --> 13:25.899
his momentum likely
would've caused him

13:25.932 --> 13:27.701
to fall facedown.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.036
He was found on his back.

13:30.704 --> 13:33.674
Is it your testimony
that it would be impossible

13:33.707 --> 13:35.542
for the victim
to have been moving forward

13:35.576 --> 13:36.743
at the time he was shot?

13:36.777 --> 13:39.245
Not impossible.
I'm speaking in likelihoods.

13:39.813 --> 13:41.582
I'm looking
at the positioning here.

13:41.615 --> 13:43.850
Bobby Donnell
was close to being

13:43.884 --> 13:45.118
in the line of fire,
wasn't he?

13:45.151 --> 13:47.288
Well, no.
He was off to the side,

13:47.321 --> 13:48.822
so the line of fire--

13:48.855 --> 13:51.692
Well, he was between
the shooter and the victim.

13:51.725 --> 13:53.427
Not exactly
a safe place to be,

13:53.460 --> 13:54.127
is it, Mr. Illich?

13:55.195 --> 13:56.997
No.
And yet,

13:57.030 --> 13:58.499
his wife fired.

13:59.366 --> 14:01.768
Did it make you wonder
whether she had just snapped?

14:01.802 --> 14:03.937
Objection.
I'm only asking

14:03.970 --> 14:06.039
if the expert
crime analyst wondered.

14:06.072 --> 14:06.973
I'll allow it.

14:08.141 --> 14:09.209
Did you wonder?

14:09.242 --> 14:11.978
I just analyze
bloodstain patterns.

14:12.012 --> 14:14.047
I don't get into
mental states.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.683
FRUTT: You're up here
to convince the jury

14:16.717 --> 14:19.185
that the victim
wasn't moving forward.

14:19.219 --> 14:21.187
The only relevance of that,
I'd assume,

14:21.221 --> 14:23.990
goes to whether Lindsay
thought she was in danger.

14:24.024 --> 14:26.293
That goes to her
mental state,

14:26.327 --> 14:27.260
does it not?

14:27.294 --> 14:28.729
Indirectly, yes.

14:28.762 --> 14:30.797
FRUTT:
Indirectly? Mr. Illich,

14:30.831 --> 14:32.966
can you make
a representation here

14:32.999 --> 14:35.636
as to Ms. Dole's
mental state or not?

14:35.669 --> 14:37.170
I'm not going to make

14:37.203 --> 14:39.072
any such representation.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.874
Thank you.

14:43.610 --> 14:44.878
DOLE:
Yes, it is an emergency.

14:44.911 --> 14:46.079
There's an intruder
in my house.

14:46.112 --> 14:47.281
MAN: Where is he?

14:47.314 --> 14:48.715
DOLE: His name is
Lawrence O'Malley.

14:48.749 --> 14:50.551
He's here in violation
of a restraining order.

14:50.584 --> 14:51.618
He's dangerous,

14:51.652 --> 14:53.620
<i>and I need for you</i>
<i>to send somebody now.</i>

14:53.654 --> 14:55.456
The address is
1312 Beacon St.,

14:55.489 --> 14:57.057
apartment 4.

14:58.224 --> 14:59.426
WALSH:
That sounded pretty calm.

14:59.460 --> 15:00.394
Objection!

15:00.427 --> 15:01.428
Sustained.

15:01.962 --> 15:03.764
WALSH: Mr. Forbes,
in the background,

15:03.797 --> 15:05.332
we can hear
other voices.

15:05.366 --> 15:07.334
FORBES: Yes, those voices
were identified

15:07.368 --> 15:08.835
as belonging
to Mr. Donnell

15:08.869 --> 15:10.471
and the victim,
Lawrence O'Malley.

15:10.504 --> 15:12.806
Were you able to detect
what they were saying?

15:12.839 --> 15:15.141
Yes. We were able
to both isolate

15:15.175 --> 15:16.643
and enhance
their conversation.

15:16.677 --> 15:17.978
Okay.

15:19.580 --> 15:20.814
DOLE:
Yes, it is an emergency.

15:20.847 --> 15:22.148
There's an intruder
in my house.

15:22.816 --> 15:23.817
DONNELL: What's wrong?

15:25.251 --> 15:27.153
<i>O'MALLEY: I promise, I'm not</i>
<i>here to cause anybody any harm.</i>

15:27.187 --> 15:29.890
I just need to talk
to her, please.

15:31.525 --> 15:33.093
That's when she hung up.

15:33.527 --> 15:35.061
Thank you, Mr. Forbes.

15:38.732 --> 15:41.402
FRUTT: You have no idea
what transpired

15:41.435 --> 15:42.469
after she hung up?

15:42.503 --> 15:44.204
Well, I know she shot him.

15:44.237 --> 15:46.172
FRUTT: Yes. Between the time

15:46.206 --> 15:48.509
she hung up
and she fired,

15:48.542 --> 15:51.378
you don't know
what was said or what happened.

15:51.412 --> 15:52.212
Correct?

15:52.746 --> 15:53.747
Correct.

15:57.017 --> 15:59.219
The defense is expected
to begin tomorrow

15:59.252 --> 16:01.254
with their psychiatric
evidence.

16:01.288 --> 16:03.357
Dr. Emily Fink
is up first.

16:03.390 --> 16:05.191
She's considered to be
one of the nation's

16:05.225 --> 16:06.259
leading authorities

16:06.293 --> 16:08.329
on battered
woman syndrome.

16:15.402 --> 16:16.637
Ellenor,

16:17.304 --> 16:18.672
you're doing great.

16:20.374 --> 16:22.309
You haven't really asked
for my advice,

16:22.343 --> 16:24.010
but could I give you some?

16:26.547 --> 16:28.515
Lindsay killed
an unarmed man.

16:28.549 --> 16:30.250
Science cannot
explain that.

16:30.284 --> 16:31.618
Only Lindsay can.

16:32.719 --> 16:35.489
Battered woman syndrome,
that's your device.

16:35.522 --> 16:37.924
It entitles the jury
to set her free,

16:37.958 --> 16:39.125
if they want to.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.428
They won't want to

16:41.462 --> 16:43.797
unless they hear
from Lindsay.

16:44.465 --> 16:45.566
And Bobby, too.

16:45.599 --> 16:48.802
Eugene thinks Walsh
is gunning for Bobby.

16:48.835 --> 16:49.670
GAMBLE: He may be.

16:50.103 --> 16:51.705
Look, I know you guys
know this,

16:51.738 --> 16:53.106
but the burden of proof

16:53.139 --> 16:54.941
isn't on
the prosecution here.

16:54.975 --> 16:57.411
The burden of an excuse

16:57.444 --> 16:58.712
is on you.

17:03.684 --> 17:05.852
FINK:
People mistakenly associate

17:05.886 --> 17:08.855
battered woman syndrome
with revenge.

17:08.888 --> 17:09.790
It isn't that.

17:09.823 --> 17:11.124
What is it, doctor?

17:11.156 --> 17:11.958
FINK: Well, mostly,

17:11.992 --> 17:14.395
it's an extreme
stress disorder.

17:14.428 --> 17:16.262
It's a mental disorder,

17:16.297 --> 17:18.999
which can cause the sufferer
to lose mental control

17:19.031 --> 17:20.434
over his or her actions.

17:20.467 --> 17:22.669
FRUTT: Did you examine
Lindsay Dole, doctor?

17:22.703 --> 17:24.137
Yes, I did.

17:24.905 --> 17:27.540
This woman was the victim
of repeated abuse,

17:27.574 --> 17:29.643
the abusers being
her own clients.

17:30.110 --> 17:31.945
She had buried
a lot of fear.

17:31.978 --> 17:33.447
She had been in denial.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.583
In reality, she had
no coping mechanisms

17:36.617 --> 17:37.951
with which to handle

17:37.984 --> 17:39.453
Mr. O'Malley's threats.

17:39.486 --> 17:41.722
At the moment
she shot him--

17:41.755 --> 17:43.557
She doesn't remember it.

17:44.190 --> 17:47.260
She suffers from
a psychological amnesia.

17:47.294 --> 17:49.896
She's walled it off
from herself

17:49.930 --> 17:52.866
as a way of psychologically
protecting herself.

17:54.401 --> 17:56.270
You say you examined
Lindsay Dole.

17:56.303 --> 17:56.970
For how long?

17:57.304 --> 17:58.472
Several hours.

17:58.505 --> 18:00.173
WALSH: And before
this examination,

18:00.206 --> 18:01.675
how long had you known
Ms. Dole?

18:01.708 --> 18:03.277
I didn't know her.

18:03.310 --> 18:04.511
WALSH: Is it your testimony

18:04.545 --> 18:06.747
Ms. Dole didn't know
what she was doing

18:06.780 --> 18:07.881
when she pulled
that trigger?

18:07.914 --> 18:09.583
My testimony is,

18:09.616 --> 18:11.552
given her history
of abuse,

18:11.585 --> 18:14.288
her fear or apprehension
was reasonable.

18:14.321 --> 18:16.390
But she likely knew
what she was doing.

18:16.423 --> 18:19.025
I don't know
whether she did or didn't.

18:19.059 --> 18:21.395
Nor does she, because
she's blocked it out.

18:21.428 --> 18:23.697
WALSH: Yes,
the psychological amnesia.

18:23.730 --> 18:26.700
Have you ever known
extreme guilt

18:26.733 --> 18:28.469
to trigger
this kind of amnesia?

18:28.969 --> 18:30.371
Yes.
WALSH: In fact, my experts

18:30.404 --> 18:32.673
tell me
psychological amnesia

18:32.706 --> 18:34.808
would be more common
in people who commit murder

18:34.841 --> 18:37.043
than people who act
in self-defense.

18:37.077 --> 18:39.313
Each case is different, and--

18:39.346 --> 18:40.180
WALSH: I appreciate that,

18:40.213 --> 18:42.349
but statistically,

18:42.383 --> 18:44.418
what's the more common cause

18:44.451 --> 18:46.320
of psychological amnesia,

18:46.353 --> 18:48.822
murder or
justified self-defense?

18:48.855 --> 18:51.057
I'm not comfortable
speaking in statistics.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.327
Let me ask again.

18:54.728 --> 18:56.263
What is the more
common cause

18:56.297 --> 18:58.499
of psychological amnesia?

18:58.532 --> 19:01.902
Murder or
justified self-defense?

19:03.570 --> 19:04.705
Murder.

19:04.738 --> 19:05.972
Thank you, doctor.

19:06.740 --> 19:09.676
(music playing)

19:23.056 --> 19:25.125
I'm gonna go next,
and then we'll finish with you.

19:25.158 --> 19:26.627
Okay.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.362
DONNELL: We need to study
the transcripts

19:28.395 --> 19:29.129
of our statements.

19:29.162 --> 19:30.397
I've studied it.

19:31.498 --> 19:33.400
It's a good idea
to go over it again.

19:33.434 --> 19:34.401
We don't want
to get caught

19:34.435 --> 19:35.936
in so much
as a discrepancy.

19:35.969 --> 19:37.971
I've studied it, Bobby.
They're not gonna catch me.

19:38.605 --> 19:39.573
Study yours.

19:44.678 --> 19:46.280
It's going very well.

19:46.980 --> 19:47.781
You do know that.

19:48.549 --> 19:49.450
I do.

19:54.588 --> 19:55.722
I'm gonna study
my statement.

19:56.457 --> 19:57.791
Good.

19:57.824 --> 19:59.159
(door opens)

20:06.933 --> 20:09.736
I consider myself friends
with both Lindsay and Bobby.

20:10.271 --> 20:11.938
Between the two of them,

20:11.972 --> 20:14.308
I think Bobby is more likely
to kill somebody.

20:14.808 --> 20:16.310
Why are they even
talking to him?

20:16.343 --> 20:17.978
JOEY:
I'm not saying he did it.

20:18.011 --> 20:20.881
I just know he's gallant.

20:20.914 --> 20:23.884
And that he'd take the fall
for his wife, if necessary.

20:24.285 --> 20:25.886
I just have my doubts.

20:25.919 --> 20:28.589
Reasonable doubts.

20:30.491 --> 20:32.158
I hope that helps.

20:34.695 --> 20:36.029
DONNELL:
She started to unravel

20:36.062 --> 20:37.898
even during the trial.

20:37.931 --> 20:39.400
FRUTT:
When you say "unravel"--

20:39.433 --> 20:41.435
DONNELL: She started having
emotional tantrums,

20:41.468 --> 20:43.169
to the point
where she said

20:43.203 --> 20:45.272
she wanted to lose
the trial.

20:45.306 --> 20:47.173
FRUTT: The trial
in which you were defending

20:47.207 --> 20:48.375
Lawrence O'Malley?

20:48.409 --> 20:51.512
DONNELL: Yes. He kept staring
at her in court,

20:51.545 --> 20:53.414
saying how he'd take her
to heaven,

20:53.447 --> 20:55.316
and she started
to come undone.

20:55.816 --> 20:58.084
We were all worried
about her.

20:58.819 --> 21:00.086
FRUTT: At some point,

21:00.120 --> 21:02.122
you took out a restraining order
against this man.

21:02.155 --> 21:04.057
Yes, but it didn't matter.

21:04.090 --> 21:05.959
He just kept coming.

21:06.493 --> 21:07.461
FRUTT: Turning your attention

21:07.494 --> 21:08.495
back to the night
in question,

21:08.529 --> 21:10.464
can you please tell us
what happened?

21:10.831 --> 21:12.198
I was in the bedroom.

21:12.232 --> 21:13.667
I heard Lindsay
scream for me.

21:13.700 --> 21:16.136
I came running out--
there he was.

21:16.169 --> 21:18.138
O'Malley?
DONNELL: Yes.

21:18.171 --> 21:19.873
I asked him to leave,
he wouldn't.

21:19.906 --> 21:21.975
I threatened
to throw him out,

21:22.008 --> 21:24.378
and then,
he just turned.

21:25.312 --> 21:26.480
He turned?

21:26.513 --> 21:28.048
DONNELL: He was a paranoid
schizophrenic

21:28.081 --> 21:30.016
who suffered from
psychotic breaks,

21:30.050 --> 21:32.886
and it looked like
he was becoming psychotic here.

21:32.919 --> 21:35.656
Then he looked at Lindsay
and told her she was in danger,

21:35.689 --> 21:38.459
told her the other man
was coming for her.

21:38.925 --> 21:39.826
FRUTT: What did you do?

21:39.860 --> 21:41.295
DONNELL:
I kept asking him to leave.

21:41.328 --> 21:42.563
I didn't want
to antagonize him,

21:42.596 --> 21:44.365
because I knew
that's what makes him snap,

21:44.398 --> 21:46.867
but it was as if
he didn't even hear me.

21:47.301 --> 21:49.503
He had this
crazed look,

21:49.536 --> 21:51.372
like he was just going
to explode or something.

21:51.805 --> 21:55.075
And then,
he threatened her again.

21:58.111 --> 22:00.180
And she just shot the gun.

22:01.815 --> 22:02.449
I looked at her.

22:02.483 --> 22:03.484
She..

22:03.950 --> 22:07.053
she had this vacant,

22:07.588 --> 22:09.490
dazed expression

22:10.357 --> 22:11.692
as she fired.

22:13.294 --> 22:14.361
She put the gun down,

22:15.962 --> 22:17.631
and then she went to her room.

22:18.432 --> 22:19.700
And what did you do?

22:19.733 --> 22:21.468
I called the police.

22:22.403 --> 22:24.471
And then I went in
to check on Lindsay.

22:24.505 --> 22:27.508
She didn't even know
what happened.

22:28.074 --> 22:29.810
She didn't know
she had shot him.

22:30.677 --> 22:32.646
It seemed like she was...

22:37.351 --> 22:38.619
just gone.

22:40.554 --> 22:41.388
Thank you.

22:54.868 --> 22:57.804
You said your wife
started to unravel

22:57.838 --> 22:59.239
during the O'Malley trial.

22:59.540 --> 23:00.541
Yes.

23:00.574 --> 23:01.942
WALSH: When?

23:01.975 --> 23:04.177
Well, it happened
almost immediately.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.246
He called her "Clarice"

23:06.280 --> 23:07.781
and made his obsession known

23:07.814 --> 23:08.615
from the beginning.

23:08.649 --> 23:10.484
But your wife
didn't beg off.

23:10.517 --> 23:12.118
She continued
to interact with him

23:12.152 --> 23:14.355
and be his lawyer.
Yes.

23:14.388 --> 23:16.222
WALSH: In fact,
you even had your wife handle

23:16.256 --> 23:17.924
Mr. O'Malley's direct testimony.

23:17.958 --> 23:20.093
That was a strategic decision.

23:20.561 --> 23:23.397
Your wife is becoming unglued,

23:23.430 --> 23:26.400
but for the sake of getting
this cannibal off,

23:26.433 --> 23:27.801
best to let her keep going?

23:27.834 --> 23:29.736
DONNELL: At the point
Lindsay did her direct,

23:29.770 --> 23:31.872
she was still basically okay.

23:31.905 --> 23:34.140
It was after that she really
started to suffer.

23:34.174 --> 23:35.509
Did you get her to a doctor?

23:35.542 --> 23:36.810
I was planning to.

23:36.843 --> 23:38.244
You were planning to?

23:39.980 --> 23:41.081
You wouldn't be lying now

23:41.114 --> 23:42.115
to help save your wife,

23:42.148 --> 23:42.983
would you, Mr. Donnell?

23:43.016 --> 23:43.817
Objection.

23:43.850 --> 23:44.751
Overruled.

23:45.286 --> 23:46.687
I'm not lying.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.854
WALSH: After she shot the man,

23:47.888 --> 23:50.557
you said you saw "a dazed,

23:50.591 --> 23:52.459
vacant look in her eyes."

23:52.493 --> 23:53.394
DONNELL: Yes.

23:53.427 --> 23:54.728
WALSH: Did you tell
the police this?

23:54.761 --> 23:56.897
The police never asked
what she looked like.

23:56.930 --> 23:59.099
Isn't it true after
witnessing the event,

23:59.132 --> 24:01.201
you knew your wife
had committed murder?

24:01.234 --> 24:02.503
That is not true.

24:02.536 --> 24:03.570
That is not true?

24:03.604 --> 24:05.472
That is not true.

24:09.576 --> 24:11.278
WOMAN:
There's a gunshot victim?

24:11.312 --> 24:13.647
DONNELL: Yes. We need
an ambulance right away

24:13.680 --> 24:15.215
at 1312 Beacon.

24:15.248 --> 24:17.284
WOMAN: And who shot the man?

24:18.485 --> 24:20.554
DONNELL: A man has been shot.

24:20.587 --> 24:21.688
Please get an ambulance

24:21.722 --> 24:23.790
to 1312 Beacon.

24:25.091 --> 24:26.860
When the operator asked you,
"Who shot the man?"

24:26.893 --> 24:27.828
why didn't you just tell her?

24:27.861 --> 24:29.830
It wasn't necessary
to tell her.

24:29.863 --> 24:30.864
WALSH: Wasn't necessary?

24:30.897 --> 24:32.733
So a man is lying
on your floor

24:32.766 --> 24:34.034
with three gunshot wounds,

24:34.067 --> 24:36.537
and you're deciding
what is or isn't necessary

24:36.570 --> 24:38.004
to tell the police operator?

24:39.139 --> 24:40.407
You called the police.

24:40.974 --> 24:42.042
Call anybody else?

24:42.075 --> 24:43.510
I called Eugene Young.

24:44.010 --> 24:45.078
A lawyer.

24:45.111 --> 24:46.880
A colleague and friend.

24:46.913 --> 24:49.983
In fact, you huddled
with Mr. Young,

24:50.016 --> 24:52.586
Ms. Frutt, another colleague
and friend,

24:52.619 --> 24:53.820
Mr. Berluti over there,

24:53.854 --> 24:55.289
another colleague and friend,

24:55.322 --> 24:57.090
and after the huddle,

24:57.123 --> 24:59.225
did you tell the police
what happened?

24:59.259 --> 25:01.227
Objection, this goes
to privileged--

25:01.261 --> 25:02.996
WALSH: I'm not asking
what the colleagues

25:03.029 --> 25:03.930
and friends talked about.

25:05.098 --> 25:06.467
I'm asking whether he talked

25:06.500 --> 25:07.634
to the police that night.

25:08.269 --> 25:10.236
The objection is overruled.

25:10.271 --> 25:12.706
WALSH: Did you tell
the police what happened?

25:12.739 --> 25:14.708
My wife had to get
to a hospital.

25:14.741 --> 25:16.543
Did you tell the police--

25:16.577 --> 25:18.645
I had to be with my wife.

25:18.679 --> 25:20.881
WALSH: Did you consider
yourselves suspects?

25:20.914 --> 25:23.016
We talked to the police
the next day.

25:23.049 --> 25:23.884
WALSH: The next day?

25:23.917 --> 25:26.953
Your lawyers organized
a meeting

25:26.987 --> 25:28.088
at your offices,

25:28.121 --> 25:29.756
under your control,

25:29.790 --> 25:31.558
where the police
could ask questions.

25:31.592 --> 25:32.559
Yes.

25:32.593 --> 25:34.561
WALSH: Mr. Donnell,
we've heard testimony

25:34.595 --> 25:37.331
of another client
who terrorized your wife,

25:37.364 --> 25:40.133
a man by the name
of William Hinks.

25:41.167 --> 25:41.935
What happened to him?

25:41.968 --> 25:43.370
Objection! Relevance.

25:43.704 --> 25:44.705
Overruled.

25:45.005 --> 25:46.540
What happened to Mr. Hinks?

25:48.842 --> 25:50.143
He was killed.

25:50.176 --> 25:51.612
He was murdered

25:53.280 --> 25:55.181
by a man you did business with,

25:55.215 --> 25:55.882
correct?

25:55.916 --> 25:58.218
By a man I used to represent.

25:58.251 --> 26:00.220
You had a conversation
with this man.

26:00.253 --> 26:03.324
This man then murdered
Mr. Hinks,

26:03.357 --> 26:05.258
and you were arrested
for conspiracy

26:05.292 --> 26:06.092
to commit murder.

26:06.126 --> 26:07.494
I was acquitted.

26:07.528 --> 26:09.796
I smell a pattern,

26:09.830 --> 26:11.565
threaten Lindsay Dole,

26:11.598 --> 26:12.533
you get killed.

26:12.566 --> 26:13.667
Objection!

26:13.700 --> 26:15.336
WARREN: Sustained!

26:15.369 --> 26:18.339
(indistinct chatter)

26:18.372 --> 26:21.308
(music playing)

26:32.986 --> 26:35.088
YOUNG: What happened?
Bobby got picked apart

26:35.121 --> 26:36.790
while Ellenor sat on her hands.

26:36.823 --> 26:38.058
BERLUTI:
It didn't go that bad.

26:38.091 --> 26:39.426
The direct was fine.

26:39.460 --> 26:40.727
DOLE: It sucked, Jimmy.

26:40.761 --> 26:41.628
Okay?

26:41.662 --> 26:43.196
It looked like
we had something to hide.

26:43.229 --> 26:45.299
Bobby played it like
we had something to hide.

26:45.332 --> 26:46.533
They introduced the Hink's Case,

26:46.567 --> 26:47.734
which should
have been objected to

26:47.768 --> 26:48.835
as a prior bad act.

26:48.869 --> 26:50.103
FRUTT:
Bobby's not the defendant.

26:50.136 --> 26:52.172
You should've been
jumping up and down!

26:52.205 --> 26:53.674
Well, I'm ready
to jump now, Lindsay.

26:53.707 --> 26:54.641
BERLUTI: All right.
FRUTT: No,

26:54.675 --> 26:56.310
what do you want from us?

26:56.343 --> 26:58.044
DONNELL: Shut it down, Ellenor.

26:59.413 --> 27:03.417
What I can't get by is
in that room--

27:03.450 --> 27:04.918
in that room,
when you all--

27:04.951 --> 27:06.687
What room?
My bedroom.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.054
When--

27:10.524 --> 27:13.026
you all came
and instinctively

27:13.059 --> 27:15.095
you looked at this as a murder.

27:15.596 --> 27:18.432
You all powwowed
with strategy

27:19.533 --> 27:21.167
because you were
at a murder scene.

27:21.935 --> 27:25.038
None of you have ever
looked at this

27:25.071 --> 27:27.274
as self-defense
or battered woman.

27:29.042 --> 27:31.312
And you're doing
everything you can

27:31.845 --> 27:34.180
to get me acquitted,
and I am so grateful,

27:34.214 --> 27:34.915
I am, but...

27:37.818 --> 27:39.152
but in your eyes,

27:39.185 --> 27:40.387
your minds,

27:42.789 --> 27:44.190
I committed a crime.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.829
And maybe in mine, too.

27:51.565 --> 27:53.467
(voice breaking)
He had no weapon.

27:56.102 --> 27:57.438
He wasn't even moving,

27:57.471 --> 27:59.606
and I just--
he was just standing there,

27:59.640 --> 28:01.942
talking,
and I shot him.

28:01.975 --> 28:03.810
I just--I just killed him.

28:03.844 --> 28:06.847
(crying)

28:27.233 --> 28:29.336
It's okay
if you get emotional.

28:31.372 --> 28:32.806
That won't hurt you.

28:34.575 --> 28:36.943
It's important to talk
about how you feel.

28:37.511 --> 28:38.912
Okay.

28:40.447 --> 28:42.015
Obviously you can't say some

28:42.048 --> 28:43.650
of the things
you said yesterday.

28:45.185 --> 28:46.487
You can't, you know.

28:47.854 --> 28:48.889
Okay.

28:58.332 --> 28:59.433
Look at me.

29:04.305 --> 29:05.839
None of us--

29:07.207 --> 29:08.975
none of us think of you

29:09.009 --> 29:10.277
as a murderer.

29:11.912 --> 29:13.246
Because you're not.

29:14.948 --> 29:16.450
The lawyer part of ourselves

29:16.483 --> 29:17.518
kicked in that night,

29:17.551 --> 29:18.452
because that's who

29:18.485 --> 29:19.920
and what we are.

29:21.087 --> 29:23.290
But nobody in this office thinks

29:23.324 --> 29:26.159
what happened
that night was murder.

29:30.264 --> 29:31.332
Okay.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.634
You snapped.

29:36.503 --> 29:37.704
I was there.

29:38.539 --> 29:39.740
I saw it.

29:40.341 --> 29:42.609
You snapped.

29:46.913 --> 29:48.214
Okay.

29:48.248 --> 29:51.184
(music playing)

29:58.825 --> 30:01.428
You say it all started
to come back.

30:01.995 --> 30:04.265
Can you tell the jury
what came back?

30:06.132 --> 30:07.868
First, Hinks,

30:07.901 --> 30:09.803
'cause Hinks tried
to kill me, too.

30:10.337 --> 30:11.538
Hinks stalked me.

30:12.273 --> 30:13.840
It was first Hinks.

30:13.874 --> 30:16.410
I--it was Hinks first,

30:17.210 --> 30:18.412
then Vogelman.

30:18.779 --> 30:20.113
FRUTT: Vogelman?

30:20.146 --> 30:21.114
George Vogelman.

30:21.147 --> 30:21.948
He was a client.

30:21.982 --> 30:23.116
He stabbed me.

30:23.717 --> 30:24.885
He was a client.

30:24.918 --> 30:25.986
His, his name was George,

30:26.019 --> 30:27.120
and--

30:28.188 --> 30:29.255
he was a client.

30:30.123 --> 30:31.425
He stabbed me.

30:32.459 --> 30:33.727
Three times.

30:34.661 --> 30:37.964
And Mr. O'Malley brought
memories of these men back?

30:38.965 --> 30:40.200
First Hinks,

30:40.233 --> 30:41.302
then Vogelman,

30:43.737 --> 30:44.871
three times.

30:45.839 --> 30:48.241
FRUTT: Lindsay,
did you ever see a doctor

30:48.275 --> 30:50.176
or a therapist
to help you deal

30:50.210 --> 30:52.379
with the trauma
over Hinks and Vogelman?

30:52.413 --> 30:54.481
I did for a while,
but then I had to be okay,

30:54.515 --> 30:55.716
so I was okay.

30:56.450 --> 30:57.851
I had to be okay.

30:58.452 --> 30:59.753
FRUTT:
Why did you have to be okay?

30:59.786 --> 31:01.722
Because I'm not a victim.

31:01.755 --> 31:03.290
I can't be a victim.

31:03.957 --> 31:05.626
That's why I opened the door.

31:06.393 --> 31:08.462
What door?
My door.

31:08.495 --> 31:09.696
When he came--

31:10.531 --> 31:11.465
O'Malley--

31:13.166 --> 31:14.768
I knew it was probably him,

31:15.636 --> 31:18.539
but I opened my door anyway.
I wasn't gonna be a victim.

31:19.139 --> 31:20.774
It was my house.

31:21.508 --> 31:23.410
And after you opened the door?

31:23.444 --> 31:24.678
I killed him.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.853
What happened
before you killed him?

31:33.587 --> 31:35.289
He was there to kill me.

31:35.322 --> 31:37.358
He came to take me to heaven.

31:37.391 --> 31:38.592
That's why--

31:41.962 --> 31:43.864
he came to take me
to heaven.

31:44.931 --> 31:45.899
FRUTT: And you perceived

31:45.932 --> 31:47.434
what he meant was...

31:47.468 --> 31:49.370
He was about to kill me.

31:50.371 --> 31:52.373
He said "I am taking you
to heaven,

31:52.406 --> 31:53.507
just like--"

31:55.008 --> 31:56.510
that's why I said it.

31:56.543 --> 31:58.244
I told him, "You go on
ahead without me,"

31:58.279 --> 31:59.380
and then I shot him.

31:59.413 --> 32:00.947
Three times,
just like Vogelman.

32:00.981 --> 32:01.915
Three times.

32:05.085 --> 32:07.053
I was afraid he'd kill me,

32:08.422 --> 32:09.523
O'Malley.

32:09.556 --> 32:11.525
Vogelman did try to kill me.

32:11.558 --> 32:12.826
He stabbed me.

32:13.694 --> 32:14.628
O'Malley stabbed, too.

32:14.661 --> 32:16.229
That's how he killed
his victims.

32:16.262 --> 32:18.131
I wasn't gonna let him eat me.

32:26.573 --> 32:27.874
I have nothing further.

32:27.908 --> 32:30.877
(music playing)

32:44.124 --> 32:45.759
After he said,

32:46.993 --> 32:48.695
"I'm going to take you
to heaven,"

32:49.863 --> 32:53.133
you said, "You go on
ahead without me"?

32:54.701 --> 32:55.769
Yes.

32:56.803 --> 32:58.071
And then you shot him.

33:00.173 --> 33:01.241
Yes.

33:02.576 --> 33:03.744
Three times?

33:06.813 --> 33:07.814
Yes.

33:09.750 --> 33:10.617
WALSH: Thank you.

33:11.818 --> 33:12.886
Nothing further.

33:14.054 --> 33:16.990
(music playing)

33:26.733 --> 33:28.234
BERLUTI: I don't think,
actually,

33:28.269 --> 33:29.636
she hurt herself.

33:30.036 --> 33:31.705
She seems on the verge--

33:31.738 --> 33:33.173
She is.

33:33.206 --> 33:35.108
FRUTT: You want me to try
for a plea?

33:35.141 --> 33:36.743
They're not offering,
but I think--

33:36.777 --> 33:38.745
DONNELL: Jimmy thinks
we didn't get hurt.

33:39.913 --> 33:41.915
FRUTT: "You go on ahead
without me"?

33:41.948 --> 33:43.750
Walsh is going
to be ringing that

33:43.784 --> 33:44.885
like the Liberty Bell.

33:45.919 --> 33:47.521
BERLUTI: She looked nuts,

33:47.554 --> 33:49.656
which is okay
for the jury to see.

33:55.161 --> 33:56.363
You ready to close?

33:56.397 --> 33:57.664
Am I ready?

33:58.965 --> 34:00.834
I stayed up all night
getting ready.

34:02.369 --> 34:03.770
The answer is,

34:06.640 --> 34:08.708
I have no idea if I'm ready.

34:08.742 --> 34:11.077
DONNELL: You need to come
through here, Ellenor.

34:12.646 --> 34:15.081
You need to close big.

34:20.987 --> 34:23.255
It's different
than it used to be.

34:23.824 --> 34:26.327
Defense attorneys,
prosecutors,

34:26.360 --> 34:28.261
we used to be the advocates

34:28.295 --> 34:29.830
that stayed out of the fray.

34:30.196 --> 34:31.231
And though we interacted

34:31.264 --> 34:32.966
with murderers every day,

34:33.400 --> 34:36.002
we were off-limits.

34:37.237 --> 34:38.204
Now,

34:39.540 --> 34:40.407
it's different.

34:41.475 --> 34:42.576
Death threats are made

34:42.609 --> 34:44.344
against district attorneys.

34:44.378 --> 34:45.911
Defendants attack

34:45.946 --> 34:47.648
their own lawyers.

34:47.681 --> 34:50.516
Lindsay Dole's life
was threatened

34:50.551 --> 34:53.554
three times by clients.

34:53.853 --> 34:55.422
Stalked,

34:55.456 --> 34:56.889
stabbed,

34:56.922 --> 34:57.691
terrorized.

34:57.724 --> 35:00.427
She is a victim of abuse,

35:00.461 --> 35:02.696
and you saw firsthand

35:02.729 --> 35:04.898
the mental effects
during her testimony.

35:05.866 --> 35:08.702
Mr. Walsh began this trial

35:08.735 --> 35:09.670
with the presumption

35:10.537 --> 35:12.005
he never would've fired the gun,

35:12.038 --> 35:14.240
and neither would any of you.

35:14.875 --> 35:16.577
First off, really?

35:17.444 --> 35:19.380
A serial killer,

35:19.413 --> 35:22.616
who strikes so fast
and unexpectedly,

35:22.649 --> 35:24.485
that has to be handcuffed

35:24.518 --> 35:27.153
and muzzled at his own trial,

35:27.187 --> 35:28.722
shows up at your house

35:28.755 --> 35:29.923
threatening to kill you.

35:29.956 --> 35:31.592
Are we really sure

35:31.625 --> 35:33.259
none of us would've fired?

35:34.194 --> 35:35.228
Secondly,

35:35.796 --> 35:37.831
neither Mr. Walsh's
state of mind

35:37.864 --> 35:41.001
nor yours is an issue here.

35:41.335 --> 35:43.804
It's Lindsay Dole's.

35:44.571 --> 35:47.207
As a sufferer
of battered woman syndrome,

35:48.241 --> 35:51.312
as a victim of past threats
from clients,

35:51.345 --> 35:54.681
attempts on her life,
being stabbed,

35:55.882 --> 35:57.551
her mental state

35:57.584 --> 35:59.853
was in a much more
fragile place.

35:59.886 --> 36:03.457
She was ready to snap
even before...

36:03.490 --> 36:04.591
he rang that doorbell.

36:06.259 --> 36:08.562
Since this whole thing turns

36:09.062 --> 36:10.564
on Lindsay's state of mind,

36:12.299 --> 36:13.934
we put her on the stand

36:15.035 --> 36:17.203
in hopes that you would get
to know her a little.

36:18.071 --> 36:19.373
Because to know her

36:20.641 --> 36:22.042
is to be convinced

36:22.075 --> 36:23.344
of her innocence.

36:24.945 --> 36:26.847
But you didn't get to see...

36:26.880 --> 36:28.048
Lindsay today.

36:30.016 --> 36:31.752
You got to see a battered woman

36:32.419 --> 36:34.154
squeezing her hands,

36:34.187 --> 36:35.622
still in trauma,

36:35.656 --> 36:37.324
determined...

36:37.824 --> 36:39.593
not to be the victim

36:39.893 --> 36:41.395
she very much is.

36:42.629 --> 36:44.197
When you go back into that room,

36:44.965 --> 36:47.534
it is okay to ask yourself,

36:47.568 --> 36:50.871
"What is the moral thing
to do here?"

36:53.239 --> 36:55.041
It isn't...

36:55.075 --> 36:56.910
putting Lindsay Dole in jail.

36:59.913 --> 37:02.583
Please return a finding
of "not guilty."

37:06.320 --> 37:07.354
Thank you.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.335
I still get moved

37:21.368 --> 37:23.036
to hear lawyers

37:23.069 --> 37:26.039
speak passionately
about their clients.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.475
Somebody asked me once,

37:28.509 --> 37:31.177
"Don't you wish prosecutors

37:31.211 --> 37:32.979
got to have clients,

37:33.013 --> 37:34.448
somebody to fight for?"

37:35.916 --> 37:37.017
Well, we do.

37:37.851 --> 37:40.387
You people are my clients.

37:40.987 --> 37:42.523
The general public,

37:43.189 --> 37:45.158
that's who I get to fight for.

37:46.427 --> 37:49.630
And as much compassion
as I feel for Lindsay Dole

37:49.663 --> 37:50.797
and I do feel it,

37:51.698 --> 37:53.800
this was an act

37:53.834 --> 37:55.336
of vigilantism.

37:56.169 --> 37:57.037
Vengeance.

37:57.671 --> 38:00.907
She threatened
earlier in the day

38:00.941 --> 38:01.775
to kill him.

38:02.443 --> 38:04.077
She got herself a gun,

38:04.110 --> 38:05.546
and she did kill him.

38:07.247 --> 38:09.015
He was not moving toward her.

38:09.483 --> 38:12.319
There is no evidence
that he yelled,

38:12.353 --> 38:14.288
made any aggressive gesture

38:14.321 --> 38:16.156
or movement toward her.

38:16.189 --> 38:18.292
He said he would take her
to heaven,

38:18.325 --> 38:20.794
and she shot him three times.

38:21.528 --> 38:23.163
The phone calls,

38:23.196 --> 38:26.333
her voice was calm, composed.

38:26.733 --> 38:28.535
Bobby Donnell's phone call

38:28.569 --> 38:30.304
clearly demonstrated he knew

38:30.337 --> 38:31.505
his wife was culpable.

38:32.038 --> 38:34.908
He refused to identify her
as the shooter.

38:34.941 --> 38:36.076
Why would he do that

38:36.109 --> 38:38.545
if he thought the shooting
was justified?

38:39.079 --> 38:40.947
Why the immediate assembly
of lawyers?

38:41.315 --> 38:43.249
The refusal to speak
to police?

38:43.984 --> 38:46.086
This is consistent

38:46.119 --> 38:47.821
with the behavior

38:47.854 --> 38:49.089
of guilty people.

38:50.090 --> 38:51.892
Are these people above the law?

38:53.226 --> 38:55.796
If you decide they are,

38:56.863 --> 38:59.600
the general public isn't served.

39:00.100 --> 39:01.302
If we're to say

39:01.335 --> 39:04.170
cold-blooded homicides are okay,

39:04.204 --> 39:07.774
so long as there has been
a pattern of past abuse,

39:08.775 --> 39:11.412
the general public isn't served.

39:12.212 --> 39:13.714
He was unarmed.

39:14.348 --> 39:15.716
He was standing

39:17.150 --> 39:18.719
15 feet away.

39:19.586 --> 39:20.954
Standing still.

39:21.588 --> 39:22.623
And she said to him,

39:22.656 --> 39:24.691
"You go on ahead without me,"

39:24.725 --> 39:26.827
and shot him three times.

39:28.028 --> 39:29.129
Now, as much as the defense

39:29.162 --> 39:30.631
would like you to focus on

39:30.664 --> 39:32.866
who and what Lindsay Dole is,

39:32.899 --> 39:34.935
this trial isn't about that.

39:34.968 --> 39:37.671
It's about what she did.

39:38.439 --> 39:40.006
And what she did...

39:40.941 --> 39:41.908
was murder.

39:41.942 --> 39:45.746
(music playing)

39:45.779 --> 39:48.048
WALSH: If you condone that,

39:48.081 --> 39:49.716
or even excuse it,

39:51.452 --> 39:53.420
the general public

39:53.454 --> 39:55.422
isn't served.

39:56.122 --> 39:57.891
The law...

39:57.924 --> 39:59.393
isn't served.

40:01.828 --> 40:03.830
And I'm sorry, Ms. Frutt,

40:05.198 --> 40:08.034
but neither is morality.

40:10.103 --> 40:13.039
(music playing)

40:36.430 --> 40:37.631
Can I say one thing?

40:39.833 --> 40:40.767
I just--

40:45.205 --> 40:47.674
I'm sorry I got upset
at you yesterday, Ellenor.

40:48.675 --> 40:50.377
I think you tried
an amazing case.

40:52.879 --> 40:53.847
Thank you.

40:57.751 --> 41:00.421
(sighs)

41:00.454 --> 41:02.122
I'm grateful to all of you.

41:05.692 --> 41:07.060
And I'm also...

41:08.595 --> 41:10.731
so sorry that I...

41:11.398 --> 41:12.533
put the firm--

41:16.837 --> 41:18.705
(sighs)

41:18.739 --> 41:20.407
I'm grateful

41:20.441 --> 41:21.608
and I'm sorry.

41:24.645 --> 41:26.112
That's what I want to say.

41:38.058 --> 41:40.994
(music playing)

41:51.905 --> 41:53.840
(door opens)

41:56.910 --> 41:59.880
(music playing)

42:11.024 --> 42:12.626
WARREN: Will the defendant
please rise?

42:17.998 --> 42:19.566
Madam Foreperson,

42:19.600 --> 42:21.868
the jury has reached
a unanimous verdict?

42:23.337 --> 42:24.371
We have, Your Honor.

42:25.372 --> 42:26.273
What say you?

42:27.841 --> 42:30.377
"Commonwealth vs. Lindsay Dole"

42:30.744 --> 42:32.178
on the count of murder

42:32.212 --> 42:33.747
in the first degree,

42:34.581 --> 42:35.949
"we find the defendant,

42:36.650 --> 42:37.984
Lindsay Dole,

42:39.119 --> 42:39.786
guilty."

42:50.230 --> 42:51.197
WARREN: Bailiff,

42:51.231 --> 42:52.766
take the defendant into custody.

42:55.269 --> 42:56.603
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

42:56.637 --> 42:57.971
thank you for your service.

42:58.004 --> 42:59.373
You're now dismissed.

43:00.173 --> 43:02.543
This matter is adjourned.

43:02.576 --> 43:03.277
(gavel bangs)

43:09.115 --> 43:11.051
(handcuffs click)

43:13.320 --> 43:16.256
(music playing)

43:45.519 --> 43:48.455
(music playing)

44:11.845 --> 44:12.846
WOMAN: You stinker!
