03:02.015 --> 03:03.351
Michelle?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.389
What are you doing here?

03:13.294 --> 03:14.762
You okay?

03:18.832 --> 03:21.335
Yeah, come on in.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.809
Yeah, Nancy and I had a fight.

03:28.842 --> 03:29.810
She went to her mother's

03:29.843 --> 03:30.944
for the evening.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.481
I don't know if
we're gonna make it.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.250
She's so angry all the time.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.818
I mean, I've tried...

03:38.919 --> 03:40.654
What are you doing?

03:41.722 --> 03:42.790
N-No, no.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.558
No, we shouldn't.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.528
Michelle?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.296
Honey!

04:24.698 --> 04:26.734
Michelle?

04:44.552 --> 04:46.019
Michelle?

04:46.053 --> 04:47.388
Mr. Miller.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.989
This is ADP security.

04:49.022 --> 04:49.857
We've received an alert

04:49.890 --> 04:51.559
that your fire alarm
has been triggered.

04:51.592 --> 04:54.362
Yeah, right. Yeah.
Look, everything's fine.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.797
It's a false alarm.
Thank you.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.767
Code is 773920.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.574
Come on, Michelle.
Pick up.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.320
Michelle!

05:37.104 --> 05:38.606
You okay?

05:42.109 --> 05:44.445
Okay...

05:44.478 --> 05:46.447
Guess we're finished.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.617
Hey, you forgot your necklace.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.988
Can we talk about this?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.893
Michelle!

06:22.115 --> 06:23.751
Michelle!

06:24.918 --> 06:27.821
Wake up. Wake up!

06:30.958 --> 06:33.126
Wh... What's happening?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.596
You're sleepwalking again.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.037
Hi. I'm Michelle Miller.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.205
I'm here for Dr. Thorston.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.206
Oh, Michelle.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.808
- Hi. I'm Dr. Carter.
- Hi.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.476
Dr. Thorston's
running late,

07:22.510 --> 07:24.645
so he asked me to show
you around.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.113
- Okay. Sure.
- Dan Miller.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.648
Nice to meet you.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.551
Let's go this way.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.086
So, the Sleep Center
has 12 sleep rooms

07:33.120 --> 07:35.188
where we conduct polysomnograms.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.090
I'm sorry.
Poly-what?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.959
Polysomnogram.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.694
It's an overnight sleep study

07:40.728 --> 07:43.964
that records brain activity,
eye movements, heart rate,

07:43.997 --> 07:45.165
et cetera.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.299
When we talked to the nurse,

07:46.333 --> 07:48.201
I don't think she said
that we were doing that today.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.904
No, no. Dr. Thorston
will need to evaluate you first

07:50.938 --> 07:52.673
and decide whether
it's even appropriate.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.207
Okay.

07:54.241 --> 07:57.277
And if so, this is where
you'd be spending the night.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.879
Oh...

07:58.912 --> 07:59.980
It's nice.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.214
Yeah, that's the idea.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.216
All the rooms are designed

08:03.250 --> 08:04.952
to look like bedrooms
or hotel suites,

08:04.985 --> 08:05.953
because we want to make you

08:05.986 --> 08:08.522
feel as comfortable as possible.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.790
Any questions?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.692
No.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.528
Okay, we're gonna borrow
Dr. Thorston's desk,

08:14.562 --> 08:16.664
and then we'll conduct
the preliminary interview.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.866
Sure.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.672
So, Michelle, have you
ever sleepwalked before?

08:24.705 --> 08:26.173
Um, yeah, I have,

08:26.206 --> 08:27.941
but it's been
a really long time.

08:27.975 --> 08:28.942
Years.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.678
We thought it had stopped.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.679
But this was different, though.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.714
She got out of bed,

08:33.746 --> 08:34.648
went downstairs,

08:34.682 --> 08:36.249
made herself some hot milk
on the stove,

08:36.283 --> 08:37.183
and then left the house,

08:37.217 --> 08:38.686
and almost burned
the whole place down.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.554
Where did you go?

08:40.587 --> 08:42.890
I don't know.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.256
You don't remember anything?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.993
No. Not a thing.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.561
Well, that's normal.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.896
And then, when she came home,

08:48.929 --> 08:50.664
I tried to wake her up,
and she hit me.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.133
Mm-hmm, you have to be careful
waking a sleepwalker.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.334
They often become violent.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.838
Yeah. I think
I got that.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.172
Well, if it happens again,

08:59.206 --> 09:01.341
the best thing
is to take her gently by the arm

09:01.374 --> 09:02.414
and guide her back to bed.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.945
So is it likely that it is
going to happen again?

09:04.978 --> 09:06.614
Oh, not necessarily,

09:06.647 --> 09:07.881
but let's see
if we can figure out

09:07.915 --> 09:09.650
what's causing
the sleepwalking...

09:09.683 --> 09:11.184
- So we can prevent it.
- Sure.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.154
Are you taking any medications?

09:14.187 --> 09:15.823
No, nothing.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.124
Taking anything to sleep?

09:17.157 --> 09:18.158
No.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.661
Problems at work?

09:20.694 --> 09:22.362
No, not really.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.364
Any stress?

09:24.397 --> 09:27.034
Or anything that's changed
lately in your life?

09:29.770 --> 09:31.872
We are trying again.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.973
Trying?

09:33.006 --> 09:34.107
To get pregnant.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.676
Right.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.910
Michelle was pregnant last year,

09:36.944 --> 09:37.945
but we lost the baby.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.613
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.547
It's okay.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.315
How long have you
been trying this time?

09:42.349 --> 09:45.786
Um... six months.

09:45.819 --> 09:49.022
Well, trying to get pregnant
can be very stressful.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.257
That could be part of it.

09:50.290 --> 09:54.027
Stress is often the trigger
for sleep disorders like this.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.797
So what do I do to stop it?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.366
Drugs like Clonazepam
have proven to be effective,

09:59.399 --> 10:00.233
but I can't prescribe it

10:00.267 --> 10:03.704
if you're still
trying to get pregnant.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.338
We are.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.008
Then the most important thing
is to try to relax.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.410
Adopt a sleep-healthy lifestyle.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.079
We'll runs some tests today,

10:12.112 --> 10:13.747
and if Dr. Thorston thinks

10:13.781 --> 10:14.848
we need to perform
a sleep study,

10:14.882 --> 10:15.849
we'll bring you back in.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.885
Sound good?

10:17.918 --> 10:18.886
Sure.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.921
Okay.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.797
Excuse me, ladies.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.901
I heard Michelle's
got a mean right hook.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.936
Yeah, she clocked me
a couple weeks ago.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.237
I'm still feeling it.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.339
Almost broke my jaw
when I tried to wake her up.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.075
You want me to file
a restraining order against her?

10:42.109 --> 10:42.943
Not yet. I'll let you know

10:42.976 --> 10:43.777
if she's getting out of line,
though.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.313
Okay. Hey, you know,
I read this case

10:46.346 --> 10:49.182
about some woman
who sleepwalked off a bridge.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.250
What happened?

10:50.283 --> 10:51.685
She drowned, Dan.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.054
That is not helping, Tyler.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.690
Well, the point is you've got
to take this stuff seriously.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.826
My partner's kid used
to sleepwalk every night

10:58.859 --> 10:59.860
for three years.

10:59.893 --> 11:00.928
Three years?

11:00.961 --> 11:03.063
Yeah, age seven to ten.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.132
He used to turn on the TV,
play music,

11:05.165 --> 11:07.067
even cut himself with a knife
one time...

11:07.100 --> 11:09.837
never even woke up.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.710
You know, just
something to think about.

11:16.744 --> 11:19.780
I mean, is there
anything they can do?

11:19.813 --> 11:22.282
Well, they've given me
these relaxation exercises,

11:22.315 --> 11:24.217
and they tell me
I have to go to bed early,

11:24.251 --> 11:26.319
and they've made me
stop drinking.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.889
Ugh, that sucks.
Dan should just lock you up.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.324
Let's hope it doesn't
get to that.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.861
Anyway... how are you?

11:33.894 --> 11:35.796
I feel like I haven't
seen you forever.

11:35.829 --> 11:36.764
Oh, I'm fine.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.398
Just Luke's been putting in
a lot of hours.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.499
I know. Dan too.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.969
I really hope that they're done
with this job soon.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.170
Cheers to that.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.305
Kate!

11:45.338 --> 11:46.807
Hey, ladies.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.775
We were starting to think you weren't
gonna make it to your own party.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.910
Yes, well, I had to run out
for more wine,

11:49.943 --> 11:51.745
because you people can drink.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.314
Oh... Guilty.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.348
Oh, I was talking to Tyler.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.017
He told me
about the sleepwalking.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.018
How are you?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.319
I'm totally fine.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.254
Okay, well,
my door's always open,

12:01.288 --> 12:02.522
if you want to talk about it.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.492
Thank you, but you know what?
I don't think that I want to...

12:05.525 --> 12:07.460
Spill your secrets
to the neighborhood shrink?

12:07.494 --> 12:09.196
I was gonna say,
"bother you."

12:09.229 --> 12:10.898
Oh, please, you are
never bothering me.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.099
And with no charge, of course.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.133
Thank you.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.367
Anyone need a top-up?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.468
Oh, Nance.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.537
What?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.505
You shouldn't have

12:18.538 --> 12:20.273
more than one glass of wine
with your meds.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.875
See? This is what I mean.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.877
Oh, no. I wasn't saying that
to try and be...

12:23.911 --> 12:24.845
Controlling?

12:24.878 --> 12:27.915
Ladies, I'm self-medicating
tonight, okay?

12:29.549 --> 12:30.984
What was that about?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.221
Alcohol doesn't
mix with her meds.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.423
I'm trying to get her to quit.

12:36.456 --> 12:40.360
Mm. She been drinking
a lot lately?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.930
I think there might be something
going on between her and Luke.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.498
What makes you say that?

12:45.532 --> 12:46.834
Just a feeling.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.468
She won't talk to me about it.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.038
I mean, she's always been
pretty private.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.539
Yeah, well, they both are.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.441
I don't know, I'm just worried.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.209
You would know if
something was going on, right?

13:09.256 --> 13:10.290
How's everything
with the hospital?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.159
Oh, we don't break ground
on that till next year.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.160
Still in the design stage.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.261
Dan asked me to consult

13:14.294 --> 13:15.228
on the psych ward.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.997
Well, if anybody knows
about psychos, it's you.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.932
That was hostile.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.934
I was just joking, sweetie.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.302
Yeah, well,
it wasn't funny, Tyler.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.071
It's not funny to make jokes
about my clients.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.006
I don't make jokes about
the criminals you represent.

13:26.039 --> 13:26.974
Well, everyone's entitled

13:27.007 --> 13:29.309
to the best defense
money can buy. Right?

13:29.342 --> 13:30.410
Yeah.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.980
Well, it doesn't make it right
to defend a rapist.

13:34.948 --> 13:35.916
What the hell's wrong with you?

13:35.949 --> 13:37.951
What? You can dish it,
but you can't take it?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.586
Well, we have guests, Kate.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.388
Yes, I'm aware of that.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.156
Hey, guys, we want to thank you

13:43.190 --> 13:45.225
for a great party,
but we've got to get going.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.460
No, you don't.
One more drink.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.996
Yeah, one more.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.363
Okay.
Okay.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.199
I'll be right back.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.601
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.419
Whoa!

14:12.452 --> 14:13.453
I'm sorry.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.487
That's all right.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.522
Uh, go ahead.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.090
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.092
You forgot your necklace.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.561
I've been looking
everywhere for that!

14:21.594 --> 14:23.630
Where did you find it?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.332
In my couch.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.967
Mm. I guess
I dropped it there

14:27.000 --> 14:29.102
when I had coffee
with Nancy last.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.403
Really?

14:30.437 --> 14:32.605
That's when
you think you lost it?

14:34.674 --> 14:37.077
Well, what are you
talking about?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.646
Seriously?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.982
I haven't been able to think
about anything else.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.023
Hey, Michelle.
Let's go.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.060
Okay.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.942
I just hate the way

15:08.976 --> 15:11.544
that Kate always fights
with Tyler in public.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.446
He started it, hon.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.315
He was just joking around.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.085
That's not how Kate sees it.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.652
All right,
I do not want to fight

15:19.686 --> 15:22.389
about why our friends
are fighting.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.656
No. Me neither.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.358
Hey, can you lock up?

15:25.392 --> 15:26.426
Sure.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.428
Oh, and...

15:28.461 --> 15:30.697
can you set the alarm, too?

15:30.730 --> 15:33.466
Of course.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.478
All locked up.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.547
Thank you.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.216
You know, maybe...

15:49.249 --> 15:51.418
I should give you a massage.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.620
The doctor said
you needed to relax.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.629
Okay, I don't think
she meant like that.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.198
You do want to have
a baby still, don't you?

16:05.232 --> 16:08.068
Um, yeah...

16:08.101 --> 16:11.171
of course, but...

16:14.207 --> 16:16.743
You're not gonna have
another miscarriage.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.445
I'm not gonna let anything bad

16:18.478 --> 16:20.180
happen to you, I promise.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.215
You can't promise that.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.085
I just want
to make you feel good.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.654
I love you.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.222
I love you, too.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.223
Let's make a baby.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.424
You know what, though?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.593
I just...

16:33.626 --> 16:35.295
Just with all
the sleepwalking and stuff,

16:35.328 --> 16:38.131
I just don't really
feel like it.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.633
Okay.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.469
Thanks.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.671
I understand.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.743
Uh, are you mad?

16:50.777 --> 16:51.778
No.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.282
I love you.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.350
Go to sleep.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.499
Hi.

17:19.571 --> 17:21.374
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.143
Why?

17:26.378 --> 17:28.115
Just go to bed, okay?

17:28.147 --> 17:29.516
You're free one night a week,

17:29.549 --> 17:31.351
and I have to chase you down.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.353
It's like you'll barely
even talk to me.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.189
What do you want from me?

17:36.223 --> 17:39.492
Well, a little intimacy
would be nice.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.493
Hey...

17:40.527 --> 17:41.394
Do we have to have

17:41.428 --> 17:42.908
this conversation
over and over again?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.368
We barely have sex anymore

17:48.401 --> 17:50.337
and you're pretending
like it's okay.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.471
I just don't feel like it, okay?

17:51.504 --> 17:52.472
You don't feel like it?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.107
No.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.409
Are we not trying
to have a family here?

17:58.245 --> 17:59.212
It's like you don't even

17:59.246 --> 18:01.414
want to talk about it anymore.

18:01.448 --> 18:04.417
It's like you're so cold,
or you're acting so weird,

18:04.451 --> 18:07.520
and I don't even...
I don't even know what to do.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.490
Just go bed, Nancy.
It's nothing.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.892
It's not nothing.
I want to talk abo...

18:12.925 --> 18:14.394
Go to bed!

18:19.566 --> 18:21.734
Just don't...

18:29.476 --> 18:31.110
Go to bed.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.495
Michelle!

20:03.536 --> 20:05.372
Michelle.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.448
I've been waiting for you.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.652
Michelle?

20:22.289 --> 20:23.723
Michelle!

21:37.430 --> 21:38.498
Michelle!

21:39.799 --> 21:42.301
Michelle!

22:42.929 --> 22:45.532
Michelle?

22:45.565 --> 22:47.634
Michelle!
Michelle, wake up.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.502
Michelle!

22:49.536 --> 22:50.937
Ow! What the hell?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.171
Michelle! Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey. Honey.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.674
Michelle!

22:59.479 --> 23:00.680
Michelle!

23:07.019 --> 23:08.655
Tyler!

23:11.891 --> 23:13.526
I was just gonna call you.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.795
Come on.

23:15.828 --> 23:16.929
I'm so embarrassed.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.097
It's okay.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.899
Got a little midnight visit.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.201
Honey.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.202
Honey, I was so scared.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.203
Are you okay?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.204
Yeah. I'm fine.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.873
She came right into our room.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.442
You know, I never had
two women in my bed before.

23:29.476 --> 23:30.777
Kate did all the experimenting
in college...

23:30.810 --> 23:32.078
Tyler, shut up.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.580
Guys, I'm so sorry.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.947
No, it's okay.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.182
Listen, I'll be at
the office tomorrow.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.550
If you want to come in and talk,

23:37.584 --> 23:38.551
I'll squeeze you in.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.686
So to speak.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.691
Can we just go home?

23:44.724 --> 23:45.958
Yeah. Yeah.
Of course.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.093
- Come on.
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.761
Thanks, guys.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.030
Yeah.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.971
How are you feeling?

24:02.509 --> 24:04.677
I feel fine.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.213
You sure you don't
remember anything?

24:07.246 --> 24:10.149
Honey, I don't
remember a thing, okay?

24:10.182 --> 24:11.618
Can we just not talk about it?

24:11.651 --> 24:14.020
I just want to go to sleep.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.623
Of course.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.058
It's gonna be fine.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.951
Well, your neighbor said
that she heard screaming.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.719
Well, that's an exaggeration.

24:46.753 --> 24:48.955
Michelle just
scared us, that's all.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.190
She break into the house?

24:51.223 --> 24:53.092
Dan and Michelle
have an open invitation

24:53.125 --> 24:54.927
to our house any time.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.563
So she didn't break in?

24:56.596 --> 24:58.297
No! No, of course not.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.766
Back door was open.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.735
Okay, well,
we've been investigating

25:02.769 --> 25:04.671
a series of break-ins
in the neighborhood.

25:04.704 --> 25:05.972
Robberies, mostly.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.640
We appreciate that, Detective,

25:07.674 --> 25:08.675
but as my wife said,

25:08.708 --> 25:10.276
this wasn't a break-in
or a robbery,

25:10.309 --> 25:12.579
and Michelle and Dan
are like family.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.312
Yeah.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.848
Okay. Well...

25:15.882 --> 25:17.249
thank you for your time.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.094
Mr. and Mrs. Miller?

25:28.127 --> 25:28.895
Yes.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.297
I'm Dr. Thorston.
Please sit down.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.768
Thanks for seeing us.
I know you were busy.

25:35.802 --> 25:37.269
Oh, it's my pleasure.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.238
Now, I understand
from Dr. Carter

25:39.271 --> 25:41.307
that you've had another
sleepwalking episode.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.976
Yeah, where she climbed
into bed with our neighbors.

25:44.010 --> 25:44.977
Dan!

25:45.011 --> 25:46.078
I'm sorry, but you did.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.180
Well, sexsomnia, or sleep sex,
is a lot more common

25:48.214 --> 25:49.649
than you might imagine.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.317
Uh, um, I'm sorry.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.653
I didn't have sex
with my neighbors.

25:53.686 --> 25:56.355
My apologies. I didn't mean
to imply that you did.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.358
It's just that this is
a relatively new field of study,

25:59.391 --> 26:01.928
and we don't understand
everything about sexsomnia,

26:01.961 --> 26:04.664
but we are watching
a diagnosis emerge.

26:04.697 --> 26:07.099
I don't remember
anything that happened.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.902
Well, that's quite normal.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.039
Sleepwalking typically occurs
in the first third of the night,

26:13.072 --> 26:15.107
when you're in
the deepest stages of slumber.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.109
It's called non-R.E.M. sleep.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.712
Non-R.E.M.-stage sleepwalkers

26:19.746 --> 26:21.748
typically don't
recall everything that happened

26:21.781 --> 26:22.682
the next day.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.283
I mean, they might have
flashes of memory,

26:24.316 --> 26:25.785
or... or nothing at all.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.655
So, what do I do
to make it stop?

26:28.688 --> 26:30.122
Well, you're gonna need
some therapy

26:30.156 --> 26:32.992
so we can figure out
why your brain is so agitated,

26:33.025 --> 26:34.060
why it's rousing your body.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.127
Okay.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.163
And I'm gonna need to get you
into the Sleep Lab

26:37.196 --> 26:38.998
as soon as possible.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.768
Well, I'm ready
for that right now.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.637
Unfortunately, our last bed
was taken yesterday.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.305
Can we just pay for a bed?

26:46.338 --> 26:48.808
No, there's simply not
enough room.

26:48.841 --> 26:52.044
I'm sure something will come up
in the next few days,

26:52.078 --> 26:53.980
or a week, maybe.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.916
Okay, what do you suggest
I do till then?

26:56.949 --> 26:59.418
Well, you could try hypnosis.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.021
There's, uh, there's
an audio program

27:02.054 --> 27:03.422
that my office can send you.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.357
You play it just before
going to bed at night,

27:05.391 --> 27:08.394
and the hypnosis tells
your brain to wake up

27:08.427 --> 27:10.429
as soon as your feet
touch the floor.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.231
Problem is

27:12.264 --> 27:14.100
it's only 50% effective.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.167
I don't care.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.704
I mean, at this point,
I'm ready to try anything.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.172
I know how awful
you must feel about this.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.974
I truly understand.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.944
But this
is a temporary condition.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.146
And it will pass.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.015
Okay.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.333
What'd you think?

27:48.434 --> 27:50.202
I mean, he was nice...

27:50.236 --> 27:52.171
I don't see how
a meditation course

27:52.204 --> 27:53.806
is gonna fix anything.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.042
Want to go home?

27:56.075 --> 27:58.344
No. I gotta go to work.
I have a deadline.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.179
You sure you're okay
to work today?

28:00.212 --> 28:02.749
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be fine.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.305
And you're two days behind

28:26.338 --> 28:27.740
on the Fenmore proposal.

28:27.774 --> 28:28.808
Put Benji on that.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.778
I tried. He said
he's already buried.

28:31.811 --> 28:32.779
Well, you can tell him

28:32.812 --> 28:34.046
I'll consider it
a personal favor.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.181
No problem.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.482
Oh, and we need
the post analytics

28:36.515 --> 28:38.084
for the digital media campaigns.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.118
Got it.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.487
Thank you.

28:42.521 --> 28:43.790
Anything else?

28:43.823 --> 28:45.858
Um, nope. No.

28:45.892 --> 28:46.893
I think I got it.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.858
Hey, man.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.060
How did it go with the doctor?

29:21.093 --> 29:21.894
I don't know.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.129
They don't really
have a solution.

29:23.162 --> 29:26.432
Well, you could lock her up.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.168
I don't think she'd go for that.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.169
You never know.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.038
Bring home some handcuffs.
See what happens.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.408
Think about it!

29:44.216 --> 29:46.352
Late night last night?

29:46.385 --> 29:47.920
Yeah, you could say that.

29:47.954 --> 29:51.257
I've just been having
some trouble sleeping lately.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.025
Oh. Thank you.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.293
No problem.
I just want to make sure

29:54.326 --> 29:56.162
you don't hit your head
on the desk.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.264
Right.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.967
You know what, I might just
have to go home early today.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.469
Sounds like a good idea.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.571
Thank you.

30:14.513 --> 30:15.514
Hello?

30:15.547 --> 30:16.949
Hey.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.417
Hi. Who is this?

30:18.450 --> 30:20.186
It's me.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.287
I'm sorry. Who?

30:21.320 --> 30:23.956
You know who.
It's me.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.325
Luke?

30:26.358 --> 30:29.161
I thought you were
coming over last night.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.630
Um, I think you have
the wrong number.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.101
That was the most fun
I've ever had.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.136
I can't stop thinking about you.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.605
Okay, n... you definitely
have the wrong number.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.273
Don't play dumb, Michelle.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.876
I need to see you.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.356
Hey, honey.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.425
Hey. Um...

30:59.458 --> 31:01.894
Uh...

31:01.928 --> 31:04.997
Can I... come over
for a cup of coffee?

31:05.031 --> 31:07.366
Yeah, sure. Are you okay?

31:07.399 --> 31:11.403
Um, I don't really want
to talk about it on the phone.

31:11.437 --> 31:14.373
Okay, um, well, I... I actually
just had a cancellation,

31:14.406 --> 31:16.008
so I can meet you at home, okay?

31:16.042 --> 31:18.010
Yeah. Okay.
I'll be right there.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.046
Thank you.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.527
Are you gonna tell Nancy?

31:35.561 --> 31:37.496
I don't know.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.000
I'm not 100% sure.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.302
I mean, it sounded like Luke,

31:43.335 --> 31:46.372
but... what if it's not?

31:47.573 --> 31:50.309
I just... I don't know.
If it were me, I'd want to know.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.981
Luke made it sound like...

31:55.014 --> 31:58.450
I had sex with him.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.587
And have you?

32:01.620 --> 32:03.355
No.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.723
Of course I haven't.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.592
Not that you remember.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.693
What do you mean?

32:07.726 --> 32:11.597
Michelle... do you remember
climbing into my bed?

32:11.630 --> 32:13.532
I'm so embarrassed about that.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.034
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.135
That's not why I brought it up.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.305
Look, sexsomnia is classified
as a sleep disorder.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.439
It's a clinical condition,

32:20.472 --> 32:23.075
it's no different from
agoraphobia or schizophrenia.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.543
Are you saying that I'm nuts?

32:24.576 --> 32:26.178
Honey, I'm not saying that.

32:26.212 --> 32:29.248
I'm just... I'm saying
there's a possibility

32:29.281 --> 32:30.749
that Luke might be
telling the truth.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.185
How do I stop this?

32:33.219 --> 32:34.486
Okay, Dr. Thorston

32:34.520 --> 32:37.189
is the preeminent researcher
in his field.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.457
What did he suggest?

32:38.490 --> 32:40.692
He told me that I had to listen
to these sleep hypnosis tapes,

32:40.726 --> 32:42.261
but...

32:42.294 --> 32:44.663
I don't know
if that's gonna work.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.465
And...

32:46.498 --> 32:48.300
he can't do anything else,

32:48.334 --> 32:51.237
because...

32:51.270 --> 32:53.505
we're trying to get
pregnant again.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.975
Okay.

32:58.444 --> 32:59.578
Do you really think

32:59.611 --> 33:02.181
this is the best time for that?

33:02.214 --> 33:04.016
What do you mean?

33:04.050 --> 33:05.151
Well, I mean, you might want

33:05.184 --> 33:06.185
to think about getting
yourself healthy

33:06.218 --> 33:07.686
before you guys start
trying to get pregnant.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.155
I am healthy.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.290
Um, physically, anyway.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.193
Well, you haven't really
been yourself lately.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.061
Well, Kate, that's because

33:15.094 --> 33:16.495
I haven't been getting
much sleep, okay?

33:16.528 --> 33:18.397
And maybe... maybe

33:18.430 --> 33:19.698
I'm coming down with something.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.500
Or...

33:21.533 --> 33:23.435
Or... what?

33:23.469 --> 33:25.404
Michelle, have you taken a test?

33:25.437 --> 33:27.173
What?

33:27.206 --> 33:28.307
A pregnancy test?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.444
No.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.782
You need to find out
if you're pregnant.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.399
Hon'?

34:27.433 --> 34:29.601
Hey!
There you are.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.639
Lasagna good for dinner?

34:33.672 --> 34:35.241
Oh, that sounds great.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.608
Yeah. Um, I'll
come down and help.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.409
I'm just gonna...

34:38.444 --> 34:39.545
I'll be down in a minute.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.580
Okay.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.646
You okay?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.682
Uh...

35:17.749 --> 35:19.485
I don't really know
how to say this.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.553
Um...

35:24.256 --> 35:26.492
You're kidding!

35:29.328 --> 35:30.862
I knew this was coming.
I could... I could feel it!

35:30.896 --> 35:33.465
I... I love you
so much.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.638
I love you, too.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.612
So, from now on,

35:46.645 --> 35:49.581
as you move forward
from this point,

35:49.615 --> 35:53.852
as you prepare to go to sleep
every night,

35:53.885 --> 35:56.422
you will be calm,

35:56.455 --> 35:59.725
be more and more calm...

35:59.758 --> 36:03.295
each and every night,

36:03.329 --> 36:05.231
and at ease...

36:05.264 --> 36:08.600
more and more at ease.

36:08.634 --> 36:12.604
Your mind and your body
will be released,

36:12.638 --> 36:14.406
relaxed,

36:14.440 --> 36:15.907
rested.

36:15.941 --> 36:19.278
You'll be able to sleep
with tranquility,

36:19.311 --> 36:20.946
confidence.

36:20.979 --> 36:25.884
Sleep the best
you have ever had.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.468
Hey.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.569
Good morning, you.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.404
Hey.

36:45.437 --> 36:46.705
Did you sleep all right?

36:47.873 --> 36:48.840
Yeah.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.943
I did. I...
I feel pretty great.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.745
So the hypnosis worked?

36:53.779 --> 36:55.381
I guess so.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.882
Maybe we're through this.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.451
Let's not jinx it just yet.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.587
No, I get it. Early days.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.855
What are you doing this morning?

37:03.889 --> 37:05.757
Day off.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.959
Probably gonna
have lunch with Kate.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.361
Can you give me a ride to work?

37:09.395 --> 37:11.530
My car's still in the shop
till this afternoon.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.464
Of course.

37:12.498 --> 37:13.899
I'm gonna get some coffee.

37:43.795 --> 37:46.598
This is gonna be
the entrance lobby.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.300
It's huge!

37:48.334 --> 37:50.836
Restaurant. Bar.
Gift shop.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.871
And...

37:53.905 --> 37:56.608
right over here is the theater.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.278
It's gonna be really cool.

38:04.383 --> 38:05.383
Here it is.

38:06.818 --> 38:09.355
Wow, honey, it's beautiful!

38:10.956 --> 38:12.591
How many people does this seat?

38:12.624 --> 38:13.592
875.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.427
Hey, Dan.

38:15.461 --> 38:16.928
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.063
Dan, you have time to meet
with the inspector?

38:18.096 --> 38:20.699
He's giving us a hard time about
this new fire sprinkler

38:20.732 --> 38:21.833
system you wanted.

38:21.867 --> 38:23.735
Uh, sure. Hey, Luke, I haven't
finished the tour yet.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.036
Can you show Michelle upstairs?

38:25.070 --> 38:27.005
- Sure, no problem.
- Thanks.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.006
See you tonight.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.908
Yeah.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.113
So, shall we?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.483
You know what? I actually
have to get to work, so I...

38:37.516 --> 38:38.817
You don't want to see upstairs?

38:38.850 --> 38:40.085
No, no, it's fine.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.087
Oh, come on.
It'll only take a second.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.523
You know what?
I'm just gonna...

38:44.556 --> 38:45.724
You sure you don't
want to see it?

38:45.757 --> 38:46.825
I'm good.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.827
Hey, what's going on with you?

38:48.860 --> 38:49.928
Nothing's going on with me.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.096
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:51.129 --> 38:53.565
Yes, you do.
Hold on.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.367
Luke, please stop following me.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.936
Not until you talk to me.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.104
What are you doing?

38:59.137 --> 39:00.138
I thought
you were coming to see me

39:00.171 --> 39:02.011
a couple nights ago,
but then you just walked...

39:02.040 --> 39:03.775
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

39:03.809 --> 39:04.843
I have to go, so just...

39:04.876 --> 39:07.379
You're just gonna pretend
that nothing happened?

39:07.413 --> 39:08.914
Nothing did happen, Luke.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.383
I was sleepwalking.
I don't remember anything!

39:11.417 --> 39:14.019
Yeah, maybe Dan believes that,
but I was there.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.053
Remember?

39:15.086 --> 39:16.588
You were amazing.

39:16.622 --> 39:17.723
No, I don't remember!

39:17.756 --> 39:18.890
Then let me help you.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.493
Luke! Stop it!
Stop it!

39:21.527 --> 39:23.595
You can't play games with me.

39:23.629 --> 39:24.763
I'm not playing games.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.031
I've loved you

39:26.064 --> 39:27.866
from the first time
I saw you 10 years ago,

39:27.899 --> 39:29.435
but you were with Dan,

39:29.468 --> 39:30.736
so I backed off.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.538
But then you came on to me!

39:32.571 --> 39:33.772
- No!
- You started this.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.173
- Stop it!
- It was amazing. Remember?

39:35.206 --> 39:36.174
Stop it. I don't!

39:36.207 --> 39:37.943
You want this as much as I do.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.144
Don't! Don't!
Stop it!

39:48.219 --> 39:49.421
Michelle!

40:05.537 --> 40:06.672
Michelle!

40:34.165 --> 40:36.635
Dammit!

40:48.747 --> 40:49.715
Hello?

40:49.748 --> 40:50.649
Kate. I need to come to you.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.818
Okay. I'm at my office.
Just come on by.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.052
Okay.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.063
Michelle. Hey! Are you okay?

41:06.097 --> 41:07.799
I don't know. Uh...

41:07.833 --> 41:09.535
Luke tried to, um...

41:09.568 --> 41:11.002
He tried to what?
What did he do?

41:11.036 --> 41:12.804
He tried to force me.

41:12.838 --> 41:13.705
Sexually?

41:13.739 --> 41:15.006
Yeah, he, well, uh...

41:15.040 --> 41:16.708
He said that
he wanted me to remember,

41:16.742 --> 41:18.644
and then he pushed me
up against the wall,

41:18.677 --> 41:19.745
and then... ugh!

41:19.778 --> 41:22.648
His hands were
all over me and...

41:22.681 --> 41:25.517
All right. Sit down.
You'll be okay.

41:25.551 --> 41:27.853
Okay. Did you call the police?

41:27.886 --> 41:30.055
No, no, I...
It didn't get that far.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.557
I just...
I pushed him off

41:31.590 --> 41:32.724
and then I got out of there.

41:32.758 --> 41:34.760
Okay, but he still
assaulted you.

41:34.793 --> 41:37.128
But there's no proof of that.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.065
Honey, you have to tell Dan.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.066
I can't.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.067
Why?

41:42.100 --> 41:44.736
He's so happy right now.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.707
You were right, I'm pregnant.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.544
And if I tell him about Luke...

41:53.745 --> 41:56.615
Ohh, he's gonna wonder
if the baby's his.

41:56.648 --> 41:58.249
You don't even know
if what Luke was telling you

41:58.283 --> 41:59.585
was the truth.

41:59.618 --> 42:01.920
Even if it is,
it's so much better

42:01.953 --> 42:04.289
for Dan to find out from you
than from anyone else.

42:04.322 --> 42:05.791
- No.
- You gotta tell him.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.192
I can't.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.994
How... I can't.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.027
I'm so sorry.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.198
Oh...

42:38.023 --> 42:38.990
Hey, bud.

42:39.024 --> 42:40.024
Hey!

42:41.827 --> 42:42.961
So how'd it go
with the fire marshal?

42:42.994 --> 42:44.863
It's good.
He signed off on everything.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.632
Great.

42:46.665 --> 42:48.600
Can you keep
something to yourself?

42:48.634 --> 42:49.635
Of course.

42:49.668 --> 42:50.535
Good, 'cause I don't know

42:50.568 --> 42:52.008
if Michelle wants
anyone to know yet.

42:52.037 --> 42:53.371
Know what?

42:53.404 --> 42:55.373
Okay, look, just keep it
to yourself for now, but, uh...

42:55.406 --> 42:57.976
we found out the other day
that Michelle's pregnant.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.880
We've been trying for so long,

43:01.913 --> 43:04.650
and I know,
it's early days still, but...

43:04.683 --> 43:07.285
I've got a great feeling
about this.

43:07.318 --> 43:09.621
That's great!

43:09.655 --> 43:11.289
That's great, Dan!

43:11.322 --> 43:13.859
Congratulations.

43:14.893 --> 43:15.861
You're gonna be a dad.

43:15.894 --> 43:17.062
I'm gonna be a dad!

43:17.095 --> 43:18.095
Wow.

43:53.164 --> 43:54.766
Hey.

43:56.267 --> 43:59.304
You brought me flowers.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.106
Yeah, I thought
we could paint in here.

44:01.139 --> 44:03.141
I got yellow because, you know,
we don't know the sex yet,

44:03.174 --> 44:06.945
and I know I should've checked
the paint color...

44:08.146 --> 44:09.347
What?

44:09.380 --> 44:10.716
Mm.

44:12.083 --> 44:15.120
Is it too soon?
Am I being too eager?

44:16.387 --> 44:18.156
What's wrong?

44:19.825 --> 44:21.927
Hey, come on, what...

44:21.960 --> 44:24.329
Are you okay? What's...
What's going on?

44:25.864 --> 44:28.867
No, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.669
You're afraid
to lose the baby again?

44:37.442 --> 44:38.844
Yeah.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.081
It's okay to be worried.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.817
It's natural.

44:45.851 --> 44:48.253
We're gonna be fine, though.

44:48.286 --> 44:50.421
The first time...

44:50.455 --> 44:53.458
Yeah, it was horrible,

44:53.491 --> 44:56.194
but that's not gonna
happen again, okay?

44:57.763 --> 45:02.000
Hey... look at me.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.468
Hey.

45:03.501 --> 45:05.871
We're gonna do this.

45:05.904 --> 45:09.107
It's gonna be fine.

45:09.140 --> 45:09.941
This time next year,

45:09.975 --> 45:11.476
these walls are
gonna be painted.

45:11.509 --> 45:14.212
The changing station
all made in that corner

45:14.245 --> 45:15.213
right there...

45:15.246 --> 45:16.314
the crib is gonna be there,

45:16.347 --> 45:17.849
with a mobile on top,

45:17.883 --> 45:19.150
and our little son,
or-or our daughter,

45:19.184 --> 45:20.485
is gonna be right here.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.187
It's gonna be amazing.

45:23.955 --> 45:25.390
Right?

45:25.423 --> 45:27.793
It's gonna be amazing.

45:27.826 --> 45:29.027
Say it with me.

45:34.933 --> 45:37.102
It's gonna be amazing.

45:50.048 --> 45:51.482
What do you mean, separate?

45:51.516 --> 45:53.184
Like a divorce?

45:53.218 --> 45:55.153
Where is this even coming from?

45:55.186 --> 45:57.488
I just said
we should talk about it.

45:59.457 --> 46:02.027
You can't pretend
that we've been happy.

46:03.995 --> 46:06.197
I thought
we'd be on the same page.

46:06.231 --> 46:08.800
The same page?

46:08.834 --> 46:10.168
The same page?

46:10.201 --> 46:11.169
Hey.

46:11.202 --> 46:12.938
What is wrong with you?

46:12.971 --> 46:16.041
Just... Just stop!
Just stop it.

46:17.008 --> 46:18.209
Ow.

46:20.211 --> 46:22.147
No. No, no.

46:22.180 --> 46:23.181
Please, Luke.

46:23.214 --> 46:25.183
- No.
- Please, I want you.

46:25.216 --> 46:26.217
- No.
- Please. I'll do anything.

46:26.251 --> 46:28.086
- No.
- Please. Please, Luke.

46:28.119 --> 46:30.788
I'll do anything to be with you.

49:57.395 --> 49:58.796
Nancy!

49:58.829 --> 50:00.398
You left the door open!

50:01.566 --> 50:03.768
Again!

50:22.120 --> 50:23.521
Who's there?

50:42.607 --> 50:45.210
I have a gun!

50:45.243 --> 50:47.245
I will use it!

51:17.208 --> 51:18.609
- Michelle?
- Yeah, I'm here.

51:20.278 --> 51:21.712
Thank God.

51:22.847 --> 51:24.849
I'm okay.

51:24.882 --> 51:26.617
You climbed out the window?

51:26.651 --> 51:28.119
What?

51:29.487 --> 51:31.289
Yeah, I guess so.

51:31.322 --> 51:33.158
Where have you been?

51:34.492 --> 51:36.861
Ohh... I don't know.

51:38.496 --> 51:39.730
It's okay.

51:42.733 --> 51:44.269
Go get warmed up.

51:44.302 --> 51:45.603
I need to call
the alarm company.

51:46.637 --> 51:48.573
Yeah. Okay.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.470
Hi, Luke.
Is Nancy here?

52:52.503 --> 52:54.439
No. She is not.

52:54.472 --> 52:55.640
Do you know where she is?

52:55.673 --> 52:57.408
She's not answering her phone.

52:57.442 --> 52:59.444
We're supposed to have breakfast
this morning, so I thought...

52:59.477 --> 53:00.545
Nancy left.

53:00.578 --> 53:02.280
What?

53:02.313 --> 53:04.649
She's not here anymore.
She left me.

53:04.682 --> 53:06.484
What do you mean?

53:06.517 --> 53:07.885
We got in a fight last night.

53:07.918 --> 53:08.819
She took off.

53:08.853 --> 53:12.623
I'm... I'm so sorry.
Is everything okay?

53:13.858 --> 53:15.993
Do you know where she went?

53:16.026 --> 53:17.462
I have no idea.

53:17.495 --> 53:19.497
Listen, if you guys
are having problems,

53:19.530 --> 53:21.266
you know that
my door is always open.

53:21.299 --> 53:23.834
Look, I have
to get to work, okay?

53:40.318 --> 53:41.452
Well?

53:41.486 --> 53:42.687
Luke says she's gone.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.555
Gone?

53:44.589 --> 53:45.390
They got in a fight,

53:45.423 --> 53:47.258
and he said
she left him last night.

53:47.292 --> 53:48.793
She wouldn't just do that,
would she?

53:48.826 --> 53:49.994
No, she wouldn't.

53:50.027 --> 53:51.462
Look, she's not
answering her phone,

53:51.496 --> 53:53.998
she's not answering her texts.

53:54.031 --> 53:55.866
Honestly, I think
we should go to the police.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.668
Kate, I don't know.
I don't think that...

53:57.702 --> 53:59.737
We don't have a choice.

53:59.770 --> 54:01.806
Look, if it were you missing,

54:01.839 --> 54:03.941
wouldn't you want me
to go looking for you?

54:09.947 --> 54:11.048
So she left?

54:11.081 --> 54:12.550
No. That's
what I'm saying.

54:12.583 --> 54:13.751
You don't think she left?

54:13.784 --> 54:15.320
We think something
happened to her.

54:15.353 --> 54:15.986
What do you mean, "something"?

54:16.020 --> 54:17.288
I have a bad feeling.

54:17.322 --> 54:19.023
I don't think that
she would just...

54:19.056 --> 54:21.892
I'm sorry. Uh...
Can I interrupt?

54:21.926 --> 54:23.928
Just I...

54:23.961 --> 54:26.564
I need something
a little more tangible here.

54:26.597 --> 54:29.600
I mean, you say that
your neighbor is acting strange,

54:29.634 --> 54:32.570
and that his wife wouldn't leave
without telling you.

54:32.603 --> 54:35.540
I mean, this is all...

54:35.573 --> 54:37.575
It sounds like
they're splitting up.

54:37.608 --> 54:38.509
You understand?

54:38.543 --> 54:40.711
I'm sure she'll call you
when she's ready.

54:40.745 --> 54:42.380
No, she wouldn't leave
without saying something.

54:42.413 --> 54:43.614
No, she wouldn't.

54:43.648 --> 54:47.652
Unless you have something else,
I... I can't really help you.

54:48.719 --> 54:50.821
Well, there was, um...

54:52.089 --> 54:53.324
You should tell him.

54:53.358 --> 54:54.692
What?

54:55.926 --> 55:00.097
I woke up at their house
last night, and...

55:00.130 --> 55:01.932
Whoa. Hold on a minute.

55:01.966 --> 55:04.335
What were you doing
in their house?

55:04.369 --> 55:06.804
I was... I was
sleepwalking.

55:08.673 --> 55:11.609
Is this what happened
at your house, too?

55:11.642 --> 55:13.611
I'm not sure that my husband

55:13.644 --> 55:15.413
would want me to answer
that question.

55:15.446 --> 55:17.515
I'll take that as a yes.

55:18.549 --> 55:20.351
All right,
tell me what happened.

55:20.385 --> 55:22.487
Did you...
Did you break in?

55:22.520 --> 55:25.956
No. I-I don't remember
how I got there,

55:25.990 --> 55:27.892
I just...
I-I woke up,

55:27.925 --> 55:29.560
there was shouting,

55:29.594 --> 55:31.829
and Luke had a gun,

55:31.862 --> 55:34.465
and there was blood.

55:34.499 --> 55:35.566
Blood?

55:35.600 --> 55:36.634
Yes.

55:39.604 --> 55:40.671
Okay.

55:42.139 --> 55:45.443
Let's start with a name.

55:54.452 --> 55:57.021
I checked all the doors,
all the windows...

55:57.054 --> 55:58.523
all locked.

55:58.556 --> 56:00.558
Thank you.

56:03.828 --> 56:06.163
I'm gonna do the hypnosis thing.

56:06.196 --> 56:08.433
Okay.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.742
So from now on...

56:17.775 --> 56:21.078
as you move forward
from this point,

56:21.111 --> 56:24.849
as you prepare to go to sleep,

56:24.882 --> 56:25.916
every night,

56:25.950 --> 56:28.686
you will be calm,

56:28.719 --> 56:32.523
be more and more calm...

56:32.557 --> 56:35.593
each and every night.

57:58.576 --> 57:59.544
Lock the door!

57:59.577 --> 58:00.645
What?

58:00.678 --> 58:02.046
Lock it! Do you have a key?
Can you lock the door?

58:02.079 --> 58:03.648
W-What are you talking about?

58:03.681 --> 58:04.915
Lock the door!
There's somebody out there!

58:04.949 --> 58:07.017
Just lock it! Please!
Just lock it!

58:09.053 --> 58:11.021
Look, are you okay?
What's going on?

58:11.055 --> 58:13.758
Just call 9-1-1!
Somebody's trying to kill me!

58:16.060 --> 58:17.728
And then he shot at me,

58:17.762 --> 58:20.164
and I... I...
I just jumped out of the way,

58:20.197 --> 58:23.167
and I just ran till I got here.

58:23.200 --> 58:25.235
Is it possible
you were dreaming?

58:26.771 --> 58:27.738
What?

58:27.772 --> 58:28.606
Dreaming.

58:28.639 --> 58:30.708
I mean, when did
you actually wake up?

58:30.741 --> 58:33.110
I mean, you were asleep
when you left your house,

58:33.143 --> 58:35.045
but yet you were awake
when we got here.

58:35.079 --> 58:37.181
Can you say, for sure,
that... that...

58:37.214 --> 58:39.049
That you woke up
before the truck,

58:39.083 --> 58:40.050
instead of after?

58:40.084 --> 58:41.185
Look, she knows what she saw.

58:41.218 --> 58:42.620
She wasn't dreaming.

58:43.520 --> 58:46.023
You happen to get a look
at the vehicle?

58:46.056 --> 58:47.091
Make or model?

58:47.124 --> 58:48.593
Color?

58:48.626 --> 58:49.994
It was a pick-up truck.

58:50.027 --> 58:51.027
Um...

58:53.263 --> 58:55.666
I don't know, it was dark.
It was dark.

58:55.700 --> 58:56.834
What about the driver?

58:56.867 --> 58:58.068
The hooded man who shot at you?

58:58.102 --> 59:00.938
Well, no, I... it was dark.
I didn't...

59:00.971 --> 59:02.272
And you have no idea

59:02.306 --> 59:04.174
why somebody would be
trying to kill you?

59:04.208 --> 59:05.242
Of course she doesn't.

59:05.275 --> 59:07.211
Look, everybody loves my wife.

59:08.613 --> 59:10.748
What about Luke Williams?

59:10.781 --> 59:12.683
The neighbor you reported?

59:12.717 --> 59:14.685
What about Luke?

59:14.719 --> 59:16.220
Well, I don't...

59:16.253 --> 59:17.855
Uh, I was worried about Nancy.

59:17.888 --> 59:18.856
I just wanted to make sure

59:18.889 --> 59:19.957
nothing had happened to her.

59:19.990 --> 59:20.958
What are you talking about?

59:20.991 --> 59:22.192
What about Nancy?

59:22.226 --> 59:23.628
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

59:23.661 --> 59:24.895
Okay. Hold on.

59:24.929 --> 59:26.964
I actually have
some news about that.

59:26.997 --> 59:28.298
I was gonna call you tomorrow.

59:28.332 --> 59:30.000
I spoke to Nancy.

59:30.034 --> 59:31.669
When?

59:31.702 --> 59:33.337
Earlier tonight.
On the phone.

59:33.370 --> 59:35.372
She corroborated what you said,
that Luke told you...

59:35.405 --> 59:36.641
That they'd had a fight

59:36.674 --> 59:38.609
and she left.

59:38.643 --> 59:42.012
Okay, well... so why
isn't she answering her phone?

59:42.046 --> 59:44.148
She didn't say.

59:44.181 --> 59:45.616
But she's... she's okay.

59:45.650 --> 59:46.784
I don't understand.

59:46.817 --> 59:48.052
What about the blood?

59:48.085 --> 59:48.953
It was Luke's blood.

59:48.986 --> 59:51.689
He cut himself pretty bad
on a glass.

59:51.722 --> 59:54.091
Look, I'm gonna check out
the video at the gas station

59:54.124 --> 59:56.761
and see
if a... a truck went through.

59:56.794 --> 59:58.195
We're taking this seriously,

59:58.228 --> 59:59.930
but you should consider
the alternatives here.

59:59.964 --> 01:00:02.332
What alternatives?

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:05.035
You should consider
a psychological evaluation.

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:07.071
I'm not crazy.

01:00:09.774 --> 01:00:12.609
I'm not!

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:45.109
Weird thing last night.

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:46.811
What's that?

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:49.079
Michelle was sleepwalking again.

01:00:49.113 --> 01:00:50.180
Oh, no...

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:51.248
Yeah.

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:53.751
She got pretty far this time.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.085
Almost out to the highway.

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.954
Wow...

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.355
Yeah, the thing is,
when she was out there,

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.825
someone was following her.

01:01:00.858 --> 01:01:02.693
What do you mean?

01:01:02.727 --> 01:01:04.361
Like, in a truck.

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:05.863
And they shot at her.

01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:08.265
Like, with a gun?

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:10.300
Yeah. We still don't
know who it was.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:12.937
She couldn't get
a good look at the truck.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.939
That's horrible.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.375
She thinks
it might have been you.

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.344
Me what?

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:22.079
In the truck.

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:23.781
Seriously?

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:24.982
Yeah, look, I know, I mean,

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.784
I told her it was impossible,

01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:29.319
but she... she went
to the police.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:31.688
But that's...

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.324
That's crazy, Dan.
What the hell?

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:35.392
Look, I'm sorry.

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:36.827
I just...

01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:37.661
Maybe it's the pregnancy,

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.897
but she's really
starting to lose it.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.431
You should take her
to a psychiatrist.

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:43.233
You need to get her
some help, man.

01:01:43.267 --> 01:01:45.736
Yeah, I will. I...

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:48.205
I just... I wanted to give you
a heads-up about the police.

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:51.208
Thanks, I guess.

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:06.523
You heading out soon?

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.292
Oh, not quite yet.

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:10.060
I still have
a ton of work to do.

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:12.129
You should cut yourself a break.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.798
You're making me look bad.

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:15.966
I will cut myself a break,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.203
as soon as I'm done
with these proofs, I promise.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:21.205
You know, you can ask me
for help if you need it, right?

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:24.041
Yes.
Thank you, Jocelyn.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:26.877
I'm fine.
You should go home.

01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:29.146
All right. Good night.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:30.747
'Night.

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:48.198
Michelle.

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:49.433
I just want to talk.

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:50.467
Luke, stay away.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.436
I'm gonna call the police.

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:53.503
You already did, right?

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:55.539
You told them
I tried to kill you.

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:57.107
Dan told me about the baby.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:59.243
It's mine, Michelle!
It has to be.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:00.344
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:01.211
Makes sense...
The timing!

01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:03.447
You guys have been
trying for months!

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.315
Come on!
Just talk to me.

01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:06.316
We can make this work.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.551
Make this work?

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:09.519
Is that what you were
trying to do yesterday,

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:10.520
when you were shooting at me?

01:03:10.554 --> 01:03:11.555
That wasn't me!

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:12.923
I would never hurt you!

01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:14.091
Michelle, please, talk to me!

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:15.125
Get away!

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:17.862
Get away!

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:19.429
Michelle! Michelle!

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.901
Michelle, let's talk!

01:03:27.071 --> 01:03:28.372
Michelle!

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.349
Okay, I'm still not sure
what I can charge him with.

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:42.352
Luke showed up at her work.
He's stalking her.

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:44.421
Showed up once,
in a public parking garage.

01:03:44.454 --> 01:03:45.455
Can't prove stalking.

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:46.991
What about shooting at her?

01:03:47.024 --> 01:03:48.192
Can't prove that, either.

01:03:48.225 --> 01:03:50.627
I need solid evidence.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.363
Now, you can file
for a restraining order,

01:03:53.397 --> 01:03:55.532
which I recommend you do
as soon as possible.

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.301
And, in the meantime,

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.169
I can go and talk to him.

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:01.105
I can't take him away,

01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:02.339
I can't arrest him,

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:04.408
but at least I can talk to him,

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:07.344
let him know
that there are eyes on him.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:11.115
Okay.

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:20.024
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you sooner.

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:22.192
It's okay.

01:04:24.929 --> 01:04:28.065
I just want it all
to be over soon.

01:04:28.098 --> 01:04:30.634
Tomorrow, I'll start
figuring out

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:32.903
how to unwind everything
with the firm.

01:04:32.937 --> 01:04:34.972
Okay. Good.

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:39.209
I know that you're scared.

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:44.514
It's not just Luke.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:50.654
I'm so scared
I'm gonna sleepwalk again.

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:53.290
I checked with
Dr. Thorston today.

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:55.259
There's still... there's
no beds available,

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:57.361
but I-I set the alarms.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:59.329
Doubled-locked the doors,
windows, garage...

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:01.398
I keep getting out.

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:05.335
Um... okay.

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:08.305
I know this is gonna
sound weird, but...

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:11.175
maybe I should handcuff you.

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:12.542
What?

01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:15.179
Like not in a kinky way.

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:17.081
I... I picked
some up today.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:18.874
I can't sleep unless
I know that you're safe.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.553
Okay.

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:30.154
Luke?

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.027
Michelle?

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.131
Are you okay?

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:15.699
Why are you covered in blood?

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:16.766
What happened?

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.735
- I don't know.
- What happened?

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:21.371
I killed him.

01:07:21.405 --> 01:07:22.839
Who?

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:26.110
I killed Luke.

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:47.224
Tyler.

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.259
They just took her
to the station.

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.354
You came onto me!

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.854
You started this.

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:24.361
Luke?

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.872
Michelle Miller.

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:03.800
Michelle.

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:09.706
Are you okay?

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:11.741
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:15.712
The police have
your fingerprints

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:16.813
on the knife

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:18.848
and all over
the scene of the crime.

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:21.451
Now, Dr. Thorston has
agreed to testify for us...

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:24.754
And the "sleepwalker defense"
has worked the past,

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:26.723
even in homicides,

01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:28.725
but only in cases
where there's been no motive.

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:31.528
W... I don't have a motive
to kill Luke.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:32.729
The police have a theory

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:34.731
that you were having
an affair with Luke.

01:10:35.799 --> 01:10:37.301
An affair?

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:39.035
The theory is

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.870
you had a fight... that explains
the bruises on your face...

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:42.872
And you killed him.

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:43.840
No.

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:46.376
Now, I know it sounds crazy.

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:47.877
The most important thing
you can do

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:49.313
is try to remember
what happened.

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:52.816
I don't even remember
getting out of the handcuffs.

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:55.519
Okay? I don't remember anything!

01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:57.987
And you won't.
Not without help.

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:00.324
What kind of help?

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:01.591
Regression therapy.

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.360
It's proved to be an effective
way of retrieving lost memories.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:04.528
Okay.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:05.762
Will that stand up in court?

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:06.863
Sure.

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:08.765
The police use it all the time.

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:11.968
To help witnesses recall
details of their memories.

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.471
Kate's set up
an appointment for you.

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:17.774
You need to go home
and get some rest.

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:20.910
Look, I know you don't want
to sleep right now,

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:23.447
but Kate says that's
the best thing for you.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.914
Let's get you out of here.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.783
I-I can go?

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.553
Yeah, the judge agreed
to grant you bail

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:31.588
because he plays
golf with Tyler.

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.390
He vouched for you himself.

01:11:33.423 --> 01:11:35.692
Thank you.

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:36.793
That's what I do.

01:11:59.883 --> 01:12:02.018
Michelle! Talk to me!
We can work it out!

01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:06.423
I really thought
we had something.

01:12:15.465 --> 01:12:17.033
Dan!

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:21.738
Dan!

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:31.748
Michelle, you okay?

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:34.083
Hey. I didn't do it, Dan.
I didn't kill Luke.

01:12:34.117 --> 01:12:35.151
I'm so stupid!

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.085
Whoa. Hey, slow down.

01:12:36.119 --> 01:12:37.353
I started to remember
when I was asleep.

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:40.557
Okay, look, I will tell Tyler,
and he can speak to the police.

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:41.925
No, no, no.
I can find the proof,

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:43.427
if I can just
get into Luke's house.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.861
No, Michelle.
That is not a good idea!

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:46.930
Michelle!

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.532
Michelle!

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:50.567
Dammit.

01:14:11.715 --> 01:14:12.682
Hey.

01:14:12.716 --> 01:14:14.217
We got the video back
from the gas station.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.351
Had Lemiski check it,

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:17.954
run the plates that showed up
between 2:00 and 4:00,

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:18.955
like you said.

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:20.724
Yeah. Anything interesting?

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:22.692
Maybe, yeah.
There was a truck rental.

01:14:22.726 --> 01:14:23.993
There was a pick-up truck?

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:25.061
Yeah.

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:26.095
Who rented it?

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:27.697
Nancy Williams.

01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:28.765
The dead guy's wife,

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.668
the one that was supposed
to have skipped town.

01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:17.747
Michelle.

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:21.050
Nancy.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:21.951
What are you doing here?

01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:22.886
Where did you go?
We've been worried sick.

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:25.722
Why is there police tape
all over my house?

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:27.957
Oh, honey.
You don't know?

01:15:27.991 --> 01:15:28.758
Know what?

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:29.993
That you're screwing my husband?

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.895
What?

01:15:31.928 --> 01:15:32.896
That you're screwing my husband!

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:33.897
No. Nancy, I...

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.599
That you came here
to take him away from me!

01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:36.833
Nancy, Luke's dead.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:39.669
Really?
I'm supposed to believe that?

01:15:39.703 --> 01:15:40.604
You're such a liar.

01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:43.039
Nancy, it's me.
I'm telling you the truth.

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:45.174
Somebody killed Luke last night.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:47.176
That's why there's
police tape everywhere.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.578
Lies!

01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:51.815
Lies, lies, lies!

01:15:51.848 --> 01:15:52.916
Nancy!

01:15:55.619 --> 01:15:57.286
What are you doing?

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.156
I know about the baby, Michelle.

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:02.258
Okay, Nancy, put the knife down.

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:05.294
I'm gonna cut that bastard
right out of you.

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:07.063
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Nancy!

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:09.833
Ahh!

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.034
Nancy, stop.

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:13.202
I'm gonna cut your head off!

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:30.286
Ahh!

01:17:07.323 --> 01:17:08.892
Michelle!

01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:10.827
There's nowhere to hide!

01:17:17.266 --> 01:17:18.367
Ugh!

01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:21.103
Ahh!

01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:27.176
Hello?

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:28.177
Michelle.

01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:29.178
Where are you?

01:17:29.212 --> 01:17:30.747
I'm at the Williams' house!

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.381
Uh, Nancy has a knife.

01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:33.950
She's trying to kill me.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:35.785
You have to find
someplace to hide!

01:17:35.819 --> 01:17:36.886
I'm 10 minutes away.

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:41.290
Come on, Michelle.
Just... Just open the door.

01:17:43.927 --> 01:17:44.928
You bitch!

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:53.469
Nancy, I called the cops!

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.270
They're on their way!

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:57.306
Not in time to save you, bitch!

01:18:19.929 --> 01:18:21.449
It's over.
It's gonna be over.

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:24.400
Ahh!

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:31.875
Michelle!

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.745
Michelle!

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:39.883
Dan! Dan, I'm in the basement!

01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:41.017
She has a knife!

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.151
Walk away, Dan.

01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:43.987
This has got
nothing to do with you.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:44.788
I just want to talk.

01:18:44.821 --> 01:18:46.222
It's a little too late for that.

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:48.024
The police
are on their way, Nancy.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.793
I know you don't
want to hurt anybody.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:53.329
Michelle said that Luke's dead.

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:55.865
I'm so sorry, Nancy.
It's true.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:02.071
Then she has to die too.

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:03.472
No. Just give me the knife.

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:04.941
She has to die!

01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:05.875
Nancy, stop!

01:19:05.909 --> 01:19:07.476
Listen to me!
You don't have to do this!

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:08.978
Nancy.

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:18.087
Are you okay?

01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:20.123
Yeah.

01:19:20.156 --> 01:19:21.557
Yeah. Are You?

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.059
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:26.529
Is she...?

01:19:36.339 --> 01:19:37.773
Unconscious.

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:42.111
Is there anyone else here?

01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:46.249
Honey.

01:19:47.851 --> 01:19:49.185
I have to tell you something.

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:51.120
No. You're hurt,
you need to sit down.

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:52.788
No, you need to just
let me get this out.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:59.863
I slept with him.

01:20:02.031 --> 01:20:03.432
What?

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:05.234
Luke.

01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:09.038
He said I did,
at least. I...

01:20:09.072 --> 01:20:11.140
I don't... It was when
I was sleepwalking,

01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:13.977
and I swear to you,
I do not remember a thing.

01:20:17.446 --> 01:20:19.148
Do you want to say anything?

01:20:19.182 --> 01:20:21.250
Ohh. What is there to say?

01:20:21.284 --> 01:20:23.452
Dan, why are you wearing gloves?

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:31.327
I've waited for you
to come clean.

01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:33.596
You knew?

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:35.164
I could smell him on you...

01:20:35.198 --> 01:20:37.266
His sweat, his aftershave!

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.168
I'm so sorry!

01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:41.037
He's my partner, Michelle!

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:43.206
My best friend!

01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:44.007
I know, I know, I know,

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.408
and I would never, ever do that!

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:48.177
You disgust me.

01:20:48.211 --> 01:20:50.213
I loved you.

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:54.217
I wanted to have
children with you,

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:55.584
and now you're gonna have
Luke's baby.

01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:57.053
We don't know that.

01:20:57.086 --> 01:20:58.955
Yes, I do.

01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:00.156
Honey...

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:03.192
I can't remember
sleeping with Luke, okay?

01:21:03.226 --> 01:21:07.030
I can't remember killing Luke,
I can't remember any of it!

01:21:07.063 --> 01:21:09.032
But I can.

01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:12.168
I can remember.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:15.104
That was part of my plan.

01:21:16.139 --> 01:21:17.440
What plan?

01:21:17.473 --> 01:21:19.909
To kill you both.

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.279
I uncuffed you.

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:29.152
I guided you to Luke's house.

01:21:29.185 --> 01:21:32.388
I knocked you out.

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:35.458
I killed Luke
and I put that knife

01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:36.659
in your hand.

01:21:39.963 --> 01:21:40.930
Dan...

01:21:40.964 --> 01:21:43.066
The gun is registered to Luke.

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:44.367
I wiped it clean.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.368
I hired a whore

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:47.436
to rent that truck
in Nancy's name.

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:48.938
I shot at you from the truck.

01:21:48.972 --> 01:21:50.473
As soon as you're dead,

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:51.707
I'm gonna put this gun
in Nancy's hand,

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:53.109
and the police will never know.

01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:01.117
Dan... it's over.

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:03.586
No...

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:04.553
It's not.

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:05.521
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:22:05.554 --> 01:22:06.722
Wait? For what?

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:09.192
I faked the sleepwalking!

01:22:09.225 --> 01:22:11.094
What?

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:14.597
I faked the whole thing.

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:15.698
You're lying.

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:17.700
And I needed a man,
so I found Luke,

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:20.269
and it was so... good.

01:22:20.303 --> 01:22:21.337
Shut up!

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.411
This is your fault!

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.383
I was screwing around
even before we got married.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.087
One more word...

01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:40.756
I loved it, too.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:43.126
Shut up!
