♪♪

00:04.790 --> 00:05.920
Previously on KC Undercover...
We are going to be

00:05.920 --> 00:06.920
disappearing for a while.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.290
The Organization is sending us

00:08.290 --> 00:09.920
to a safe house
in Rio de Janeiro.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.500
( all shouting )
Hey! Hey! Hey hey hey hey!

00:11.500 --> 00:13.500
The whole point of us hiding
from Zane

00:13.500 --> 00:14.670
is to stay safe.

00:14.670 --> 00:16.460
So can we please
not kill each other?

00:16.460 --> 00:18.290
You have the green light
to engage.

00:18.290 --> 00:21.710
Operation Good-bye Coopers...
is a go.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.670
The reason why we're in
this stupid jungle,

00:23.670 --> 00:25.120
the reason why we're on the run,

00:25.120 --> 00:27.040
the reason why Zane is even free
and knows where we are

00:27.040 --> 00:28.670
is because of me.

00:28.670 --> 00:31.500
I'm the one who did all this,
so I have to fix it.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.080
Hey, excuse me, pilot.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.880
Where are we going to next?
Is there a new safe house?

00:35.880 --> 00:38.920
PILOT: No! You're not
going to a safe house.

00:38.920 --> 00:42.000
In fact, you're not safe....

00:42.000 --> 00:43.290
at all.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.120
Good luck, Coopers!

00:46.120 --> 00:48.120
( laughs )You're gonna need it.

00:57.420 --> 01:00.210
Go get the parachutes!
There are none!

01:00.210 --> 01:02.420
What kind of helicopter
doesn't have parachutes?

01:02.420 --> 01:04.500
The kind that's rigged
to kill us!

01:04.500 --> 01:05.620
Before we crash,

01:05.620 --> 01:07.290
I just want everybody to know--

01:07.290 --> 01:09.290
We know, we know.
We love you, too.

01:09.290 --> 01:12.500
No. I was gonna say
that I'm made of titanium,

01:12.500 --> 01:14.170
so I'm actually
gonna make it.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.620
But nice knowing you guys.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.290
We're all gonna make it,
all right?

01:19.290 --> 01:20.330
Everybody hold on
and prepare for

01:20.330 --> 01:21.710
a controlled water landing.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.120
Are you sure you don't mean

01:23.120 --> 01:26.290
"controlled fiery crash
into the ocean"?

01:26.290 --> 01:27.670
Just buckle up
and hold on.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.880
Heads down, stay down,
brace, brace, brace!

01:32.670 --> 01:35.710
What? I saw it in a movie
once and everybody lives.

01:35.710 --> 01:39.500
ALL: Heads down, stay down,
brace, brace, brace!

01:43.330 --> 01:46.500
Whoo!
( loud crash )

01:46.500 --> 01:48.290
All right, we made it.

01:48.290 --> 01:51.670
That's right.
We're no longer crashing.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.290
We're sinking!
( Marisa screams )

01:53.290 --> 01:55.880
Quick! Everybody!
Start drinking water!

01:57.920 --> 02:00.790
Well, come up with a plan
that makes more sense!

02:00.790 --> 02:02.380

VOICE OVER P.A.:
Remain calm.

03:01.290 --> 03:03.670
Help is on the way.

03:05.540 --> 03:06.960
Well, good thing for you guys

03:06.960 --> 03:08.420
our ship came along
just when it did.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.250
Your parents are resting.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.920
Considering what you've been
through, you're all very lucky.

03:11.920 --> 03:16.040
Lucky? We have lost
a member of our family.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.420
It is dead,

03:17.420 --> 03:18.960
and you are doing
absolutely nothing

03:18.960 --> 03:21.120
to resuscitate it.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.460
Save my baby!

03:24.120 --> 03:25.380
She's acting erratic.

03:25.380 --> 03:26.750
I think she may be in shock.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.460
No, that's just Marisa.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.460
Captain, I think
we have problem.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.380
Oh, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.460
What's the issue?
She has no pulse.

03:36.460 --> 03:38.250
What exactly
do you mean?

03:38.250 --> 03:40.250
That much like my ex-girlfriend,

03:40.250 --> 03:42.420
she has no heart.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.500
Uh, that's ridiculous.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.420
Come on, guys,
of course she has a pulse--

03:47.420 --> 03:50.330
and all of the other things
that normal human beings have.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.420
Her blood pressure
is zero over zero.

03:52.420 --> 03:53.380
What?!

03:53.380 --> 03:56.620
( laughing loudly )

03:56.620 --> 03:58.790
That is hysterical.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.790
Your blood pressure machine
must be broken.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.290
Yeah.
Speaking of broken,

04:02.290 --> 04:04.000
shouldn't you guys be trying
to fix Marisa's phone?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.500
Listen, I need
a plastic bag

04:05.500 --> 04:07.750
and 50 CCs of rice, stat!

04:07.750 --> 04:10.380
Did you try drawing
any blood?

04:10.380 --> 04:14.080
Well, I tried, but it's like
she's made of metal.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.040
You know what?

04:17.040 --> 04:18.710
It's been a crazy day.

04:18.710 --> 04:22.460
Helicopter crashes, non-functioning
medical equipment...

04:22.460 --> 04:25.170
Yeah, I think what I need
is a little rest,

04:25.170 --> 04:26.540
and tomorrow morning
I'll give you

04:26.540 --> 04:28.920
all the blood pressure
and heartbeats you want.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.500
Yup.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.460
Uh, hold on there,
young lady.

04:35.710 --> 04:38.670
That doesn't look good.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.620
Oh, great.
Her skin can bend needles,

04:40.620 --> 04:41.710
but the second
you touch her arm,

04:41.710 --> 04:42.710
it completely falls off.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.330
( computer chimes )

04:48.330 --> 04:50.120
Carl!

04:50.120 --> 04:53.460
Carl! I'm getting
a hologram alert.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.250
( chimes )
Pick it up, Carl!

04:57.460 --> 04:59.080
( sighs )

04:59.080 --> 05:02.000
That guy is never at his desk
when he's supposed to be.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.580
He's probably chatting it up
with Kathy

05:03.580 --> 05:04.920
in Accounts Payable.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.790
She's got a boyfriend, Carl!

05:06.790 --> 05:08.750
And get me some darn coffee!

05:11.210 --> 05:12.960
Agent Beverly here.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.120
It's Johnson. I'm on my way
back from Brazil,

05:15.120 --> 05:17.120
and I have
some terrible news.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.380
If it's about your rash,
I don't want to hear it.

05:19.380 --> 05:20.420
No.

05:22.210 --> 05:23.880
The Cooper's helicopter
went down

05:23.880 --> 05:24.960
over the Atlantic.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.460
I have confirmation...

05:27.460 --> 05:29.170
there were no survivors.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.080
Not now, Carl!

05:37.420 --> 05:39.170
( sighs deeply )

05:41.460 --> 05:43.540
Thank you
for your cooperation.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.040
I just have one more question.

05:46.040 --> 05:49.380
How do you explain...
this?

05:49.380 --> 05:52.290
I've never seen that before
in my life.

05:52.290 --> 05:54.710
What life?
You have no blood.

05:54.710 --> 05:57.000
Or pulse. You're all
wires and attitude!

05:58.830 --> 06:00.290
Okay, guys, we gotta
tell him the truth.

06:00.290 --> 06:01.460
Craig, no.
Honey,

06:01.460 --> 06:03.710
we don't have a choice.

06:03.710 --> 06:06.330
Look, the following information
is completely classified.

06:06.330 --> 06:08.460
I'm Craig Cooper, senior
agent with The Organization.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.290
All rightie.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.330
The what?

06:14.330 --> 06:15.330
The Organization.

06:15.330 --> 06:16.790
It's a secret government
spy agency.

06:16.790 --> 06:20.000
We're all agents,
and Judy is our robot daughter.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.330
And Marisa is my best friend
who lives next door.

06:22.330 --> 06:25.290
I realize that doesn't help
the believability of the story,

06:25.290 --> 06:27.790
but you know what,
it's true.

06:27.790 --> 06:31.710
Right. I've never even
heard of "The Organization."

06:31.710 --> 06:33.460
Well, I mean,
in all fairness,

06:33.460 --> 06:35.330
it wouldn't really be
a secret government spy agency

06:35.330 --> 06:37.330
if everyone knew about it.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.500
Do I look like
a fool to you?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.920
ALL: Well...

06:41.920 --> 06:44.330
I know what's going on here.

06:44.330 --> 06:46.380
You're all from the future,

06:46.380 --> 06:49.710
and she's your terminator robot
here to change the past!

06:49.710 --> 06:52.080
Really? That's what
you came up with?

06:52.080 --> 06:53.830
MARISA: Exactly.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.500
If they could
change the past,

06:56.500 --> 06:59.460
would I really have
such lousy grades?

06:59.460 --> 07:02.290
ALL: Hmm...

07:02.290 --> 07:04.210
I'm takin' you
straight to D.C.

07:04.210 --> 07:05.960
The big brass is gonna
have some questions

07:05.960 --> 07:08.330
about you,
your fake agency,

07:08.330 --> 07:10.170
and your little robot friend.

07:12.290 --> 07:16.330
Well, that manicure
was total waste of money.

07:18.420 --> 07:21.120
A helicopter attempted
a water landing

07:21.120 --> 07:23.210
just off the coast of Rio
this evening.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.330
Sadly, there were
no survivors.

07:25.330 --> 07:27.460
Can't watch that enough!

07:27.460 --> 07:30.500
Sadly, there were
no survivors.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.330
Sadly, there were
no survivors.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.380
Sadly, there were
no survivors.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.620
I think I have
my new ring tone!

07:37.620 --> 07:39.040
( laughs )

07:44.460 --> 07:46.710
The Organization can't
clear us with the captain

07:46.710 --> 07:48.750
because the captain doesn't know
The Organization exists,

07:48.750 --> 07:50.880
and you can't be cleared by
something you don't know exists.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.830
Yeah. They're gonna tear Judy
into a million pieces

07:52.830 --> 07:55.460
until they realize
she's not Arnold Schwarzenegger.

07:55.460 --> 08:00.290
I'm so mad, if I had two arms
I'd strangle somebody.

08:00.290 --> 08:02.790
We gotta get of this boat
and back to D.C.

08:02.790 --> 08:04.580
There's gotta be some way
we can get out of here.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.380
I have an idea.
Ernie, pull my finger.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.620
Now is not the time
for sophomoric humor.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.790
Just pull it!

08:11.920 --> 08:13.500
KC: Okay, so,

08:13.500 --> 08:15.750
now you're down to
four fingers and one arm.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.330
How is that helpful?
It's a skeleton key.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.290
Huh. Well, that is helpful.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.170
Perfect.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.210
All right.

08:31.330 --> 08:32.290
All right, everybody,

08:32.290 --> 08:33.460
we made it out of the crash,
everybody--

08:34.880 --> 08:37.460
Okay, where is everybody?

08:37.460 --> 08:38.960
Oh, no!

08:38.960 --> 08:41.210
There's a memorial service
for us!

08:41.210 --> 08:43.500
I guess we didn't make it
after all.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.380
We're the walking dead!

08:46.380 --> 08:49.540
He's lucky they tore off
my slapping hand.

08:49.540 --> 08:51.250
Okay, it's time
to tell Beverly

08:51.250 --> 08:52.500
and let everyone know
we're okay.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.500
Uh, actually, Mom,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.170
out in the jungle
I saw Ernie use a leaf

08:55.170 --> 08:56.670
for toiler paper,
so I won't be okay

08:56.670 --> 08:58.830
for a very long, long time.

09:02.290 --> 09:04.290
BEVERLY: For twenty years

09:04.290 --> 09:07.000
Craig and Kira
gave their all

09:07.000 --> 09:08.460
to The Organization.

09:08.460 --> 09:12.210
Their accomplishments
are unparalleled.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.290
All right, let's stop Beverly

09:13.290 --> 09:15.580
before she ugly-cries
her mascara all over the place.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.500
Hold on. Can't we listen
a little bit longer?

09:17.500 --> 09:19.790
Beverly Hasn't said
anything nice about me since--

09:19.790 --> 09:22.380
I don't think she's ever
said anything nice about me.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.790
Well, we have
been through a lot.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.540
I mean, it wouldn't hurt
to hear our friends say

09:26.540 --> 09:27.830
a few nice words.

09:27.830 --> 09:30.120
Seriously? You guys
need an ego boost that bad

09:30.120 --> 09:31.920
that you're willing to let
people think that you're dead?

09:31.920 --> 09:33.380
That's a little sad.

09:33.380 --> 09:36.380
BEVERLY:
Losing a family of agents

09:36.380 --> 09:38.420
is tough,

09:38.420 --> 09:42.210
especially when one of them
was KC Cooper.

09:42.210 --> 09:44.460
She had more promise

09:44.460 --> 09:47.290
than any young agent
I've ever met.

09:47.290 --> 09:49.790
On the other hand, who is it gonna hurt?
Not me. I'm in.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.170
Of course,

09:52.170 --> 09:56.290
if KC wasn't instrumental in Zane's
original escape from prison,

09:56.290 --> 09:57.540
none of this
would have ever happened.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.920
Okay, you know what,
enough is enough.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.420
KC, please!
I'm enjoying this.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.960
And no one worked harder
than young Ernie.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.380
Of course, he had to--
he was born with so few skills.

10:14.290 --> 10:17.880
Well, suddenly this is
worth listening to.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.500
And lets' not forget
about young Judy.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.460
Wait for it.

10:21.460 --> 10:24.460
Five million bucks
down the toilet.

10:24.460 --> 10:26.880
On an unrelated note,

10:26.880 --> 10:29.380
there will no longer be complimentary
bagels served in the morning.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.330
( all protest )

10:31.330 --> 10:32.620
( clamoring continues )

10:33.920 --> 10:35.830
May the Coopers...

10:35.830 --> 10:38.580
all rest in peace.

10:38.580 --> 10:42.210
And now we will hear
from Kira's parents,

10:42.210 --> 10:45.880
retired agents
Othello and Gayle King.

10:48.620 --> 10:50.460
( Gayle clears throat,
sniffles )

10:50.460 --> 10:53.750
Zane took my Kira
and her babies.

10:53.750 --> 10:57.750
Beautiful KC,
smart, quirky little Ernie,

10:57.750 --> 10:59.880
and poor little Judy.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.080
( sobs )
Oh...

11:01.080 --> 11:04.880
And Craig!
What about Craig?

11:04.880 --> 11:07.290
And don forget
that chucklehead Craig!

11:07.290 --> 11:11.290
Who I'm sure played a big part of
this all going horribly wrong.

11:11.290 --> 11:12.620
Well, you were mentioned, honey.

11:12.620 --> 11:13.960
Ya happy now?

11:13.960 --> 11:16.500
Not so much.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.620
A few hours ago,
Zane claimed responsibility

11:18.620 --> 11:20.500
for that helicopter going down,

11:20.500 --> 11:22.750
and declared it a victory
for The Other Side.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.120
They won't
get away with this!

11:24.120 --> 11:25.170
No, they won't.

11:25.170 --> 11:27.420
I want everyone
on high alert.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.500
We cannot repeat
this tragedy.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.670
( sobbing )

11:30.670 --> 11:31.960
Okay, you know,
this has gone too far.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.380
I'm telling my parents
we're alive.

11:33.380 --> 11:34.500
No, no, Mom! We can't!
KC!

11:34.500 --> 11:36.170
Did you hear
what Beverly just said?

11:36.170 --> 11:37.460
Zane thinks he killed us, okay?

11:37.460 --> 11:38.620
Our best shot
at capturing him

11:38.620 --> 11:40.500
is if he still thinks
we're dead.

11:40.500 --> 11:46.460
GAYLE (singing):
♪ Amazing grace ♪

11:46.460 --> 11:52.710
♪ How sweet the sound ♪

11:52.710 --> 11:55.500
♪ That saved ♪

11:55.500 --> 11:58.420

11:58.420 --> 12:03.920

12:03.920 --> 12:08.380

12:08.380 --> 12:09.830
Mm-hmm, lost.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.380

12:12.380 --> 12:15.500
♪ I'm found ♪

12:15.500 --> 12:17.580

12:23.080 --> 12:25.330
Mm-hmm.
( sobbing )

12:25.330 --> 12:26.540
( sniffling )

12:26.540 --> 12:27.960
You all right, bro?

12:27.960 --> 12:29.330
It's okay. Remember,
we're all right.

12:29.330 --> 12:31.170
( crying )
It's not that.

12:31.170 --> 12:33.330
I'm gonna miss
the morning bagels.

12:38.080 --> 12:42.830
( sobbing ) Oh, now--now
stay strong, Gayle, now.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.580
That's what they
would have wanted.

12:44.580 --> 12:47.710
But look at those beautiful,
smiling faces.

12:47.710 --> 12:49.710
Better times.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.040
Othello.
Yeah?

12:57.040 --> 13:00.500
You remember if I took
my medication this morning?

13:00.500 --> 13:02.170
Mom, it's us!
We're alive!

13:02.170 --> 13:03.500
We're okay!

13:03.500 --> 13:04.960
Oh! Thanks goodness!

13:04.960 --> 13:06.330
You almost scared me to--

13:07.380 --> 13:08.290
Ohh!

13:08.290 --> 13:10.170
Ohhh!

13:10.170 --> 13:11.380
Are you okay?

13:11.380 --> 13:13.460
Othello.
KIRA: Pops?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.420
Gotcha!

13:15.420 --> 13:17.420
Now you know how it feels
when someone you love

13:17.420 --> 13:19.290
tricks you into
thinking they're gone.

13:19.290 --> 13:22.170
Not so nice, is it?

13:22.170 --> 13:25.330
That's messed up, Pops.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.920
I'm so happy
my babies are alive

13:32.920 --> 13:35.380
and back home
where they belong.

13:35.380 --> 13:36.330
Mwah! Now,

13:36.330 --> 13:38.460
who wants to head down
to The Organization

13:38.460 --> 13:39.790
and tell 'em the good news?

13:39.790 --> 13:42.210
Uh, G-Grandma.
Grandma, we--

13:42.210 --> 13:44.210
we can't tell anyone
that we're alive.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.290
Why? Has all this been
some hare-brained plan

13:46.290 --> 13:49.620
Craig hatched to get out
of his cell phone contract?

13:49.620 --> 13:52.000
All right, honey. Honey. Okay.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.420
No. We're staying dead
so that we can take down Zane.

13:54.420 --> 13:55.830
The less people that know,
the better.

13:55.830 --> 13:57.380
We can't risk anybody
finding out.

13:57.380 --> 13:59.500
Our first step is to lure
Zane out in the open.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.500
Any ideas?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.420
I know. We'll film a commercial

14:02.420 --> 14:04.920
advertising one of those million
dollar sweepstake prizes.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.920
We'll pump it to Zane's cable
system a hundred times a day

14:07.920 --> 14:09.790
until he can't help
but enter the contest.

14:09.790 --> 14:11.830
Once he subscribes
to the three magazines

14:11.830 --> 14:13.000
and sends in his entry form,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.580
he'll move to
the semi-final rounds.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.500
Eventually we'll declare him
the winner,

14:16.500 --> 14:17.960
and when he comes
to collect his prize

14:17.960 --> 14:20.330
we'll jump in and grab him
and put him in prison.

14:21.580 --> 14:24.210
Just one problem.

14:24.210 --> 14:27.710
We're gonna need one of
those giant novelty checks.

14:27.710 --> 14:30.750
Yeah...that's the one problem
with that plan.

14:32.380 --> 14:34.290
You know, I have an idea
to draw him out.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.380
We'll get Judy to disguise
her voice as Brett's,

14:37.380 --> 14:39.250
call Zane,
and then set up a meeting.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.540
Except we don't have
Zane's number.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.920
Well, we would if we went
with the sweepstakes plan

14:42.920 --> 14:44.540
and have him put his number
on the entry form.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.540
KC: You know what?

14:46.540 --> 14:48.460
I spoke too soon, bro.
That's a great idea.

14:48.460 --> 14:51.330
How about you go upstairs and get started
on that big novelty check thing?

14:51.330 --> 14:53.620
Will do!
All right, man.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.620
Get started.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.540
Where were we?

15:00.330 --> 15:01.620
( phone beeping )

15:03.040 --> 15:04.120
Yes?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.500
Dad, it's Brett.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.790
Brett?

15:06.790 --> 15:08.540
I'm ready
to come back home.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.710
I want to work with you,
father and son,

15:10.710 --> 15:12.420
conquering the world
together.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.790
Nothing would please me more,
Brett.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.290
BRETT'S VOICE: Great.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.290
How does the parking lot
at the Falls Church Mall sound?

15:18.290 --> 15:20.500
I'll meet you there
in an hour.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.500
ZANE: Why don't we just
meet at the place where

15:22.500 --> 15:23.880
we would have your
birthday party every year

15:23.880 --> 15:24.880
when you were a kid?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.040
JUDY/BRETT:
Nice.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.040
Love that place.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.170
Big fan, big fan.

15:30.170 --> 15:31.960
Although...

15:31.960 --> 15:33.540
I hear that there's
a new pizza place

15:33.540 --> 15:35.120
in Georgetown
that's really good.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.710
Why don't we meet there?
My treat.

15:37.710 --> 15:40.580
No, I think the birthday
place is safest.

15:40.580 --> 15:44.880
Great. And what corner
is that on again?

15:44.880 --> 15:47.290
The same corner
it's always been on.

15:47.290 --> 15:49.500
Okay. Meet you there
in an hour.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.040
Lookin' forward to it.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.330
( disconnects )

15:52.330 --> 15:53.620
All right, you need to
call Brett and find out

15:53.620 --> 15:54.920
where he had
his birthday parties.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.500
Okay. The plan is officially
in motion.

16:02.710 --> 16:04.000
Oh, man.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.170
Now I have to void this one.

16:15.330 --> 16:16.500
Clear.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.080
Clear.
Clear.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.420
All right. I tapped into
the closed circuit feed.

16:20.420 --> 16:21.830
I've got eyes
on the parking lot

16:21.830 --> 16:23.420
and I'll let you know
when Zane arrives.

16:23.420 --> 16:25.290
Hey, where's Pops?

16:27.170 --> 16:28.750
Othello, what are you doing
with that hot dog?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.170
I'm hungry.

16:30.170 --> 16:32.120
You know I can't fight
on an empty stomach.

16:32.120 --> 16:36.500
Honey, your stomach Hasn't
been empty for 25 years.

16:36.500 --> 16:41.080
That's because I'm still trying to digest
that tuna casserole you made in 1992.

16:41.080 --> 16:45.080
It's like I swallowed
a fish-flavored bowling ball.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.290
CRAIG: Guy, guys.

16:46.290 --> 16:48.620
Focus. Zane could be here
any minute.

16:48.620 --> 16:51.290
Okay, Zane is coming alone,
but he's expecting Brett.

16:51.290 --> 16:53.170
So we have the element
of surprise.

16:53.170 --> 16:54.620
And knowing him,
he will be armed,

16:54.620 --> 16:56.380
so I'll jump him
and take his weapon.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.880
Yes. Your mother and I
will subdue him.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.500
Pops, Gayle, you back us up
if there's any problems.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.830
Okay.
Any questions?

17:01.830 --> 17:03.960
Yeah.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.380
When are we gonna
go over the plan?

17:06.380 --> 17:07.380
KC: Pops.
Hmm?

17:07.380 --> 17:09.000
Turn your hearing aid up.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.420
Oh. Oh. Sorry.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.500
I'm used to turning it down
when Craig starts talking.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.790
You better turn it back down, because I
got a few choice words for you, old man.

17:16.790 --> 17:19.170
( arguing )
Wow.

17:19.170 --> 17:22.120
I didn't know Dad
knew that word.

17:22.120 --> 17:26.380
I did. Guess you've never seen
him overcook a toasty strudel.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.790
I can't believe it.

17:27.790 --> 17:31.210
We finally have a mission
at a fun place for kids

17:31.210 --> 17:33.710
and then shove the only
two kids in the van.

17:33.710 --> 17:36.000
They really must not
trust us in there.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.290
Us? I'm in here because
I only have one arm.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.750
What's your excuse?

17:45.330 --> 17:46.380
I have Zane.

17:46.380 --> 17:49.750
Repeat: Zane has arrived
and he is alone.

17:49.750 --> 17:52.960
Time to bake the biscuits.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.290
Get to your positions now.

17:59.460 --> 18:00.500
Brett?

18:02.330 --> 18:04.540
Son?

18:04.540 --> 18:06.330
Where are you?

18:13.330 --> 18:15.120
Weapon secured.

18:18.290 --> 18:19.380
You're goin' down, Zane.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.120
Am I?

18:22.380 --> 18:24.380
Or are you?

18:26.210 --> 18:29.120
POPS: Whoa, hey!
CRAIG: Easy! Easy!

18:29.120 --> 18:30.380
Easy!
Whoa.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.920
Guys! There's eight enemy
agents in there with laser guns!

18:33.920 --> 18:35.330
Yeah, that's for the update,
Ernie.

18:37.330 --> 18:39.420
What are we supposed to do now?
ZANE: Here's an idea.

18:39.420 --> 18:41.080
Drop your weapons
and give up.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.670
Yeah, I'm definitely
not doing that.

18:42.670 --> 18:44.040
Listen, I let you go
once before,

18:44.040 --> 18:45.790
there's absolutely nothing
you could say or do

18:45.790 --> 18:47.880
to make me put my weapon down.

18:47.880 --> 18:48.960
( whistles )

18:51.290 --> 18:53.330
Marisa, are you okay?

18:53.330 --> 18:54.620
KC, I'm fine,
but I'm scared.

18:54.620 --> 18:56.120
Just do something, please.
Listen,

18:56.120 --> 18:57.500
you touch my friend
and I swear I'll--

18:57.500 --> 18:58.710
You'll what?

18:58.710 --> 18:59.830
Try to trick me again?

18:59.830 --> 19:00.830
( chuckles )

19:00.830 --> 19:02.580
Give me some credit, KC.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.420
I'm a professional spy.

19:04.420 --> 19:07.080
When Brett agreed
to meet me here,

19:07.080 --> 19:08.620
I knew something was up.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.620
Now, drop your weapons,

19:11.620 --> 19:14.420
and I'll release
your big-mouth buddy.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.460
Okay, fine.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.670
Marisa, run!

19:36.500 --> 19:37.380
Oh, no.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.460
Guys, you've got company.

19:39.460 --> 19:40.540
Company?

19:40.540 --> 19:43.080
( kids screaming with delight )

19:46.290 --> 19:48.420
I got you!
Now you shoot!

19:48.420 --> 19:50.170
Okay, well, you asked for it.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.290
( kids shriek )

19:55.290 --> 19:56.330
Whoa!

19:56.330 --> 19:59.540
Switch laser guns
with me!

19:59.540 --> 20:01.710
I don't think
that's a good idea, junior.

20:01.710 --> 20:03.670
I wish there was something
we could do!

20:03.670 --> 20:06.290
There is. Patch me
into the speaker system.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.710
( computer beeps )

20:07.710 --> 20:09.290
We're in.

20:09.290 --> 20:10.670
Attention, kids!

20:10.670 --> 20:13.290
There's an all-you-can-eat
candy bar in the lobby!

20:13.290 --> 20:16.080
JUDY (over P.A.): And did
I mention it's freeeee?

20:16.080 --> 20:18.290
( kids shrieking )

20:36.460 --> 20:37.750
( Zane whimpering )

20:42.120 --> 20:43.830
Go ahead, KC.

20:43.830 --> 20:45.830
Let's get this over with.

20:45.830 --> 20:48.670
Hmph. After everything
you put my family through,

20:48.670 --> 20:51.670
I cannot wait to eliminate
you once and for all.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.210
No, KC, don't do it.

21:00.330 --> 21:03.080
I'm not going to.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.420
( chuckles )
I should have known

21:05.420 --> 21:08.080
you didn't have the guts,
little girl.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.250
You and your pathetic
little family.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.380
Hey, no, you didn't let
this little girl finish.

21:12.380 --> 21:13.790
You know, I'm not
taking you out,

21:13.790 --> 21:15.330
because that would
just be doing you a favor.

21:15.330 --> 21:16.960
I'd rather you rot
in a tiny cell

21:16.960 --> 21:18.960
for the rest of
your miserable little life.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.540
Pathetic.
Huh.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.880
You did the right thing, KC.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.380
Yeah, well, I'm about
to do the wrong thing.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.580
( Zane groaning )

21:28.580 --> 21:31.170
( sighs of relief )

21:31.170 --> 21:33.290
Guys, it's over.
Yeah.

21:33.290 --> 21:36.000
We're finally safe and we do not have
to worry about The Other Side anymore.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.210
Ahh.
Yes.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.080
MAN: The Organization,
The Other Side.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.620
The Other Side,
The Organization.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.210
Round and round,
a chaotic circle.

21:47.210 --> 21:50.080
Well, now it's time for...

21:50.080 --> 21:51.710
The Alternate.
