WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.304
WHAT IS UP
WITH THE COP UNIFORM?

00:03.304 --> 00:05.436
AW, THIS IS FROM
WHEN GRAYSON PROPOSED TO ME,

00:05.436 --> 00:08.709
BUT LATELY, WE'VE BEEN USING IT
FOR, WELL, YOU KNOW HOW WE DO.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.241
(singsongy) ROLEPLAYAS.

00:10.241 --> 00:13.514
OHH. (chuckles) YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN NAKED.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.515
OOH.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.586
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IF WE TALKED

00:15.586 --> 00:17.448
ABOUT OUR SEX LIFE
ALL THE TIME?

00:17.448 --> 00:19.050
OH, COME ON.
NO. DON'T. NO, NO, NO.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.452
GREAT. THEY'RE GROSSED OUT
BY THE THOUGHT OF US NAKED.

00:21.452 --> 00:23.194
NOTUS,MY FRIEND.

00:23.194 --> 00:24.355
(chuckles)

00:24.355 --> 00:32.803
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:32.803 --> 00:34.365
(all) NEWSPAPER JINX!

00:34.365 --> 00:38.269
I WIN. COME ON, GUYS.
HAND 'EM OVER.

00:38.269 --> 00:41.572
AHH. SWEET, TRIPLE COUPONS.

00:41.572 --> 00:43.043
TOM, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD

00:43.043 --> 00:45.316
TURN THAT NEW FOUNTAIN OFF
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?

00:45.316 --> 00:46.547
WHY?

00:46.547 --> 00:47.678
I SLEEP WITH MY WINDOWS OPEN,

00:47.678 --> 00:50.121
AND IT JUST MAKES ME
HAVE TO PEE CONSTANTLY.

00:51.582 --> 00:54.255
(laughter)

00:54.255 --> 00:57.057
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
WAS THAT MAGIC?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.429
IT'S THE DAMN BICYCLE BOYS.

00:58.429 --> 01:00.531
THEY FOUND A SHORTCUT
TO THE NEW MALL.

01:00.531 --> 01:01.662
WHAT NEW MALL?

01:01.662 --> 01:03.434
THEY BUILT IT RIGHT
BEHIND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:03.434 --> 01:06.137
YOU SIGNED MY PETITION
TRYING TO STOP IT, REMEMBER?

01:06.137 --> 01:07.098
NO.

01:07.098 --> 01:08.839
THE BICYCLE BOYS
ARE BAD NEWS, JULES.

01:08.839 --> 01:11.142
THEY--THEY WRITE "DON'T"
ON THE STOP SIGNS.

01:11.142 --> 01:13.504
THEY CALL ANYONE OVER 20
"GRANDPA."

01:13.504 --> 01:17.077
THEY...
MADE MY GARDEN GNOMES GAY.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.250
(heavenly choir sings)

01:19.250 --> 01:22.283
ACTUALLY, THAT WAS ME, TOM,
BUT THOSE BICYCLE BOYS--

01:22.283 --> 01:24.715
THEY PICKED
THE WRONG CUL-DE-SAC.

01:25.856 --> 01:27.618
DUCK!
WHAT? OH!

01:30.391 --> 01:33.794
A NEW MALL? THAT'S HORRIBLE.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.796
DO THEY HAVE
HOT DOGS ON A STICK?

01:35.796 --> 01:38.629
NO! WE AREAGAINST
THE NEW MALL, EVEN THOUGH

01:38.629 --> 01:41.202
THEY HAVE AN AWESOME MEN'S STORE
CALLED "SHORT AND WIDE."

01:41.202 --> 01:42.533
I BELIEVE WE JUST FOUND
YOUR NEW NICKNAME.

01:42.533 --> 01:44.535
FINE, BUT I WILL
STILL GLADLY TAKE ON

01:44.535 --> 01:46.777
THE BURDEN OF HANDLING
THE BICYCLE BOYS.

01:46.777 --> 01:48.409
SHORT AND WIDE FANCIES HIMSELF

01:48.409 --> 01:50.311
THE PROTECTOR
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.484
I'M MORE LIKE THE KING.
I DO EVERYTHING AROUND HERE.

01:53.484 --> 01:54.785
NO, YOU DON'T.

01:54.785 --> 01:56.647
WHO GOT US ALL
NEW RECYCLING BINS?

01:56.647 --> 01:58.849
WHO WRITES THE CUL-DE-SAC'S
WEEKLY NEWSLETTER?

01:58.849 --> 02:01.552
WHO GOT THE PERMITS SO TOM
COULD PUT UP HIS FOUNTAIN?

02:01.552 --> 02:04.425
THAT THING UNDID SIX MONTHS
OF POTTY TRAINING FOR STAN.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.198
ANDY, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT MANUAL LABOR.

02:07.198 --> 02:11.202
KINGS DIDN'T BUILD
THE PYRAMIDS. SLAVES DID.

02:11.202 --> 02:13.304
OR ALIENS.

02:13.304 --> 02:15.636
YOU KNOW, I WINE-WATCHED
A DOCUMENTARY LAST NIGHT,

02:15.636 --> 02:17.268
AND IT'S ALL A LITTLE FUZZY.

02:17.268 --> 02:19.440
COME BACK, SWEETIE.
BRING YOUR POINT WITH YOU.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.441
SORRY.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.642
I AM THE KING
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

02:21.642 --> 02:23.574
BECAUSE I TAKE CARE
OF THE PEOPLE.

02:23.574 --> 02:25.746
WHO SAVED
THE GOLDSTEINS' MARRIAGE?

02:25.746 --> 02:28.879
HUH? WHO STOPPED MRS. ROSE
FROM HER SUICIDE ATTEMPT?

02:28.879 --> 02:30.651
SHE WAS GONNA
JUMP OFF HER SHED.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.553
SHE WAS HOLDING SCISSORS.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.626
OKAY.
LET'S TAKE IT TO A VOTE.

02:35.626 --> 02:38.759
OKAY, ALL THAT THINK ANDY
IS KING OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

02:38.759 --> 02:40.231
RAISE YOUR HAND.

02:40.231 --> 02:41.762
в™Єв™Єв™Є

02:41.762 --> 02:43.163
GRAYSON, COUNT THOSE.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.165
GIVE ME A SEC.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.298
ZERO.

02:47.298 --> 02:49.600
AND THOSE WHO THINKIAM KING.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.342
ALL HAIL KING JULES.

02:51.342 --> 02:52.303
WHOO!

02:52.303 --> 02:53.774
COME ON!

02:53.774 --> 02:55.606
BYE, S.W.

02:55.606 --> 03:00.581
(camera beeping,
shutter clicking)

03:00.581 --> 03:02.213
OKAY, DAD, STOP POSING.

03:02.213 --> 03:04.515
THE ASSIGNMENT IS TO TAKE
A PICTURE OF A STRANGER

03:04.515 --> 03:06.287
WORKING IN
HIS NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.389
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW
YOU'RE BEING PHOTOGRAPHED.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.660
I SEE THE CAMERA RIGHT THERE.

03:09.660 --> 03:10.921
I SEE YOUR DILEMMA.

03:10.921 --> 03:12.363
CAN I WEAR THE PIRATE HAT?

03:12.363 --> 03:13.264
NO PIRATE HAT.

03:13.264 --> 03:15.366
THIS IS GONNA BE
A BORING PICTURE.

03:15.366 --> 03:17.868
CRAZY IDEA--INSTEAD OF CHEATING
ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT,

03:17.868 --> 03:20.371
HOW ABOUT--GET THIS--
NOT CHEATING?

03:20.371 --> 03:22.503
YEAH, THAT'S NOT REALLY
AN OPTION WITH THE OLD, UH...

03:22.503 --> 03:23.504
(clack)

03:23.504 --> 03:24.635
SKULL FRACTURE.

03:24.635 --> 03:26.337
YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU TRY TO TAKE

03:26.337 --> 03:29.340
SECRET SHOTS OF STRANGERS
WHILE WEARING A HELMET?

03:29.340 --> 03:30.741
(high-pitched voice)
"DADDY, LOOK!"

03:30.741 --> 03:32.443
(normal voice)
"IT'S DORK VADER."

03:32.443 --> 03:33.544
"IT'S DORK VADER."

03:33.544 --> 03:34.545
I GOT THAT ONE A LOT.

03:34.545 --> 03:36.317
OKAY, HERE. BOBBY.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.719
GO LIKE THIS. PURSE YOUR LIPS
A LITTLE, LIKE...

03:38.719 --> 03:41.252
WHAT? IT'S--IT'S WHAT WE DID

03:41.252 --> 03:43.694
WHEN I WAS AN UNDERWEAR MODEL
FOR MONTGOMERY WARD.

03:43.694 --> 03:45.896
YOU JUST TRIED TO SLIP THAT ONE
IN THERE, DIDN'T YA?

03:45.896 --> 03:48.329
THERE ARE TWO TYPES
OF UNDERWEAR MODELS--

03:48.329 --> 03:51.402
FRONT GUYS AND BUTT GUYS.
I WAS BOTH.

03:51.402 --> 03:53.504
HE SAID PROUDLY.
ALL RIGHT. DAD.

03:53.504 --> 03:57.408
GRAYSON IN BIKINI BRIEFS--
THINK ABOUT IT.

03:57.408 --> 03:58.469
(beeping and clicking)

03:58.469 --> 04:00.471
WHOA, IT'S NOT A SAD THING.

04:00.471 --> 04:01.472
(beep)

04:01.472 --> 04:03.474
LAURIE,
WHY ARE YOU TEXTING ME?

04:03.474 --> 04:05.716
AND YOU SENT ME
A NUDE PICTURE OF YOURSELF?

04:05.716 --> 04:08.619
BOOM!
YOU JUST GOT PHOTO BOMBED.

04:08.619 --> 04:09.780
WOW.

04:09.780 --> 04:13.023
(chuckles) WHOA.
CHECK OUT YOUR DOWNSTAIRS.

04:13.023 --> 04:14.455
SOMEONE'S AN ARTIST.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.886
THANK YOU.
DEAR GOD, JELLY BEAN.

04:15.886 --> 04:19.029
WHY WOULD YOU RISK HAVING
A PICTURE LIKE THIS GET OUT?

04:19.029 --> 04:20.431
WHAT RISK?

04:20.431 --> 04:22.963
THE WHOLE WORLD SAW
PARIS HILTON'S BERTS AND ERNIE,

04:22.963 --> 04:24.735
AND NOW SHE'S RICH.

04:24.735 --> 04:27.037
YEAH, ANDNOWSHE'S RICH.

04:27.037 --> 04:29.300
JULES PUT NAKED PICTURES
OF HERSELF ONLINE.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.441
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

04:30.441 --> 04:31.972
APPARENTLY,
ANYONE CAN CALL THEMSELVES

04:31.972 --> 04:34.505
AN "ONLINE DERMATOLOGIST."

04:34.505 --> 04:36.547
NOW I HAVE ELLIE CHECK
MY DOWNSTAIRS MOLES.

04:36.547 --> 04:38.409
NOTHING GOOD COMES OUT OF

04:38.409 --> 04:41.382
LETTING NUDE PICTURES
OF YOURSELF OUT IN THE WORLD.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.315
YOU ARE SO WRONG,
AND I'M GOING TO PROVE IT.

04:44.315 --> 04:45.456
THERE'S THIS ARMY GUY
IN AFGHANISTAN

04:45.456 --> 04:46.987
THAT I MET ON TWITTER.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.461
HE'S BEEN ASKING FOR A SKIN PIC,
AND NOW I AM ABOUT TO OBLIGE.

04:50.461 --> 04:52.863
(singsongy) "SEND."

04:52.863 --> 04:54.825
(normal voice) DON'T WORRY.
I KEPT IT CLASSY.

04:54.825 --> 04:56.697
COVERED UP MY BERTS.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.400
SINGLE-NERPED HIM.
(whispers) JUST A PEEK.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.371
YOU'RE A DUMMY.

05:01.832 --> 05:04.435
IT'S AMAZING
YOU GOT THIS FROM A STRANGER.

05:04.435 --> 05:08.379
THE SEA HAS TAKEN SO MUCH
FROM HIM, AND YET...

05:08.379 --> 05:11.311
(sighs) IT'S ALL HE HAS.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.743
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?

05:12.743 --> 05:14.515
NO. HEAD OF MY DEPARTMENT
WAS WALKING BY.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.786
I WANTED TO SOUND SMART.

05:15.786 --> 05:16.987
HEH.

05:16.987 --> 05:19.319
OH, COME ON.
DON'T GO SENSITIVE ARTIST ON ME.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.392
(groans)
LOOK AT ME.

05:21.392 --> 05:23.924
WOW, IT IS NOT EASY
TO HAVE AN HONEST MOMENT

05:23.924 --> 05:26.657
WITH A KID WEARING A HELMET.
UM, I'LL PUSH THROUGH.

05:26.657 --> 05:28.859
OKAY, SO USUALLY WHEN I TELL
STUDENTS THEIR WORK MOVES ME,

05:28.859 --> 05:30.501
I'M LYING
TO SPARE THEIR FEELINGS.

05:30.501 --> 05:32.463
THERE'S A LOT OF CRIERS
AT THIS SCHOOL.

05:32.463 --> 05:35.706
BUT YOUR WORK DOES MOVE ME.

05:35.706 --> 05:38.509
THANKS.

05:38.509 --> 05:40.110
(whistles)

05:40.110 --> 05:42.473
(mutters)

05:42.473 --> 05:44.415
(voice breaking)
PROFESSOR LeCLAIRE?

05:44.415 --> 05:46.377
EVERYONE HATES MY PHOTO ESSAY.
(crying)

05:46.377 --> 05:49.680
OH, FRANKLIN, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S WONDERFUL.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.351
(whispers)
IT'S NOT. IT'S BAD.

05:56.827 --> 05:58.789
AAH! AAH! HEY, SIG.

05:58.789 --> 06:01.031
YOU KNOW THAT DREAM WHEN YOU'RE
FALLING AND YOU WON'T STOP?

06:01.031 --> 06:03.434
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE THAT
ALL THE TIME NOW.

06:03.434 --> 06:04.895
WHY IS THAT, HELMET?

06:04.895 --> 06:07.137
FOR STARTERS,
PEOPLE CALL ME "HELMET."

06:07.137 --> 06:08.739
ALSO, I'M CHEATING
IN MY FAVORITE CLASS

06:08.739 --> 06:10.641
WITH THE ONLY TEACHER
WHO'S EVER BELIEVED IN MY TALENT

06:10.641 --> 06:13.604
AS AN ARTIST. I'M NOT SURE
HOW IT COULD GET MUCH WORSE.
(door closes)

06:13.604 --> 06:15.706
TRAV.

06:15.706 --> 06:17.708
I'M IN LOVE WITH THAT GAL.

06:17.708 --> 06:21.752
(snaps fingers)
THERE IT IS.AAH!

06:25.085 --> 06:28.018
(laughter)
WELL, YOU FANCY YOURSELF
THE KING OF THE PEOPLE.

06:28.018 --> 06:30.461
SO GO AHEAD. HANDLE IT.

06:30.461 --> 06:32.392
I WILL. HEY, GUYS.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.924
GUYS.

06:33.924 --> 06:36.567
(tires skid)
WOW. THOSE ARE COOL BIKES.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.729
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID,
I HAD A HUFFY.

06:39.970 --> 06:42.803
HER NAME WAS "SPARKLY THUNDER."

06:42.803 --> 06:47.908
ANYWAY, INSTEAD OF
GOING THROUGH OUR YARDS...

06:47.908 --> 06:49.440
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:49.440 --> 06:51.542
OH, WELL, THAT'S CUTE.

06:51.542 --> 06:55.786
WELL, I'LL JUST WAIT HERE
TILL YOU GET BORED. GOT ALL DAY.

06:55.786 --> 06:57.688
OH.

06:57.688 --> 07:00.491
STUPID FOUNTAIN.
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE

07:00.491 --> 07:03.594
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN PEE
RIGHT HERE IN THE STREET?

07:03.594 --> 07:06.557
YEAH.
I-I'D WANT TO SEE THAT, TOO.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.565
I CALL BATHROOM.
I CALL WINDOW.

07:14.565 --> 07:17.437
WHAT?
FINE. I'LL GO DOWNSTAIRS.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.639
OH.

07:20.741 --> 07:24.615
THAT'S IT. THIS ENDS NOW.

07:24.615 --> 07:26.717
THE BICYCLE BOYS
STOLE MY FOUNTAIN.

07:26.717 --> 07:28.048
(gasps)
NO.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.980
COME ON!
DAMN THEM!

07:29.980 --> 07:33.053
OH! I AM SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS, TOM.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.084
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND.

07:34.084 --> 07:35.726
I REALLY AM.

07:37.087 --> 07:39.660
NOW LET ME SAY
WHAT WE'RE ALL THINKING.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.461
WINE FOUNTAIN.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.733
OKAY, WE HAVE TO DO THAT.

07:42.733 --> 07:44.895
AGREED,
BUT FIRST I NEED HELP

07:44.895 --> 07:47.698
FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO
WITH THE BICYCLE BOYS.

07:47.698 --> 07:49.670
YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD ALWAYS--
I'M SORRY.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.772
I ALREADY FIXED IT.
I ALMOST FORGOT--

07:51.772 --> 07:54.745
MEET OFFICER PUMPKINHEAD.

07:54.745 --> 07:55.846
THOSE BOYS WILL SEE HIM,

07:55.846 --> 07:59.179
THINK THE PLACE IS CRAWLING
WITH 5-O, AND MOVE ALONG.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.781
THERE'S NO WAY THIS WORKS.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.682
OH.

08:02.753 --> 08:05.015
(tires screech)

08:08.158 --> 08:10.120
WAIT.
I WANT TO SAY IT WITH YOU.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.563
(both) COME ON!

08:14.094 --> 08:15.495
GUESS WHAT?

08:15.495 --> 08:16.697
NO, THANKS.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.229
THE ARMY GUY AND I
STAYED UP ALL NIGHT TWEETING,

08:19.229 --> 08:22.773
AND NOW WE'RE DATING.
IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SERIOUS.

08:22.773 --> 08:24.735
IT'S HEALTHY
WHEN THINGS MOVE THAT FAST.

08:24.735 --> 08:26.006
I TOLD YOU
GOOD THINGS WOULD COME

08:26.006 --> 08:27.808
FROM SENDING NAKED PICTURES.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.641
YOU'RE FAKE-DATING
SOMEONE YOU'VE NEVER MET,

08:30.641 --> 08:32.783
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT
BE IN THE ARMY,

08:32.783 --> 08:34.685
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE A MAN,

08:34.685 --> 08:37.648
AND WHO MAY OR MAY NOT
SLICE YOU FROM NOSE TO NAVEL

08:37.648 --> 08:39.189
WHEN YOU FINALLY MEET.

08:39.189 --> 08:41.521
(whispers)
I WONDER WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

08:41.521 --> 08:45.195
(normal voice) I HOPE
IF HE'S BLACK, HE'SSUPER BLACK.

08:45.195 --> 08:48.559
DARK BLACK IS HOT.
IS THAT RACIST?

08:48.559 --> 08:51.732
(speaking inaudibly)

08:51.732 --> 08:54.705
NO, BUT IT MAKES US
UNCOMFORTABLE.

08:54.705 --> 08:56.066
OKAY.

08:56.066 --> 08:57.568
DAD, COME ON.

08:57.568 --> 08:59.670
YOU'RE BEING EVEN MORE
RIDICULOUS THAN NORMAL.

08:59.670 --> 09:00.741
IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.072
WELL, HE'S JUST MAD
BECAUSE I'M IN LOVE

09:02.072 --> 09:03.774
WITH A GAL
I'VE NEVER EVEN MET.

09:03.774 --> 09:06.977
NO WAY! I'M IN LOVE WITH A DUDE
I'VE NEVER MET. NO LOOK!

09:06.977 --> 09:08.949
MAYBE LOOKING IS IMPORTANT.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.080
I ONLY SAW HER
FOR A SECOND,

09:10.080 --> 09:13.824
BUT MAN, MY HEART RACED,
TIME STOPPED.

09:13.824 --> 09:14.825
FIREWORKS?

09:14.825 --> 09:16.126
(whistles)

09:16.126 --> 09:17.327
I MEAN,
HAVEN'T YOU GUYS EVER FELT

09:17.327 --> 09:18.989
AN INSTANT CONNECTION
WITH SOMEONE YOU JUST MET?

09:18.989 --> 09:20.230
NEVER.
ONCE.

09:20.230 --> 09:21.662
SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.594
AND ONLY ELLIE
IS CORRECT.

09:23.594 --> 09:25.736
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

09:25.736 --> 09:27.297
(moans)

09:27.297 --> 09:28.969
(Travis)
UH, PROFESSOR LeCLAIRE--

09:28.969 --> 09:33.003
(moans) JUST GIVE ME A SEC.
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.

09:33.003 --> 09:34.274
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.277
(speaking French)

09:40.681 --> 09:42.112
YOU DON'T SPEAK FRENCH,
DO YOU?

09:42.112 --> 09:43.283
ENOUGH.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.616
OH.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.359
(bicycle wheels spinning)
WHAT THE...

09:51.762 --> 09:54.925
YOU GET BACK HERE!
HE WILL SHOOT YOU!

09:54.925 --> 09:56.967
(clatter)

09:56.967 --> 09:59.269
NO!

09:59.269 --> 10:02.873
DID YOU TURN OFFICER PUMPKINHEAD
AROUND AND BLOW HIS COVER?

10:02.873 --> 10:04.935
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?
(beep)

10:04.935 --> 10:06.907
(man's voice cackles)

10:06.907 --> 10:10.811
AW, HE ONLY SPEAKS
IN SPOOKY LAUGHS. (laughs)

10:10.811 --> 10:11.812
DON'T.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.845
YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS.

10:14.845 --> 10:16.847
AAH! (yells)

10:16.847 --> 10:19.920
YOU BETTER RUN!
ELLIE! (yells)

10:22.122 --> 10:23.824
OH!

10:23.824 --> 10:26.296
(lock clicks)

10:26.296 --> 10:28.358
YOU THINK YOU'RE SAFE.

10:28.358 --> 10:31.902
ONE OF THESE ROCKS
HAS A KEY IN IT.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.365
SHOOT.

10:35.365 --> 10:37.708
SEE, THIS WAS
MY BOXER BRIEF POSE...

10:38.939 --> 10:41.171
BUT IF I WAS MODELING
RACER BRIEFS,

10:41.171 --> 10:44.214
I'D JUST ARCH MY BACK A LITTLE,
MAYBE POP THE CHEEKS LIKE SO.

10:44.214 --> 10:45.876
BAM.

10:45.876 --> 10:48.879
(chuckles)
MISS THOSE DAYS.

10:48.879 --> 10:50.781
YOU AND NO ONE ELSE ON EARTH.

10:50.781 --> 10:52.983
THE MALE PRISONERS
WHO KEEP MY FAN SITE ACTIVE

10:52.983 --> 10:54.755
STRONGLY DISAGREE.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.158
YOU KNOW WHO LOOKS GREAT
IN HIS RACER BRIEFS...

10:58.158 --> 10:59.790
PROBABLY?

10:59.790 --> 11:02.893
WADE, MY ARMY BOYFRIEND,

11:02.893 --> 11:05.035
WHO IS--FINGERS CROSSED--

11:05.035 --> 11:08.238
SUPER DARK BLACK,
BLACKER THAN SPACE.

11:08.238 --> 11:10.040
THATFELT PRETTY RACIST.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.341
SEE, I STILL SAY NO.

11:11.341 --> 11:14.905
THIS IS THE BEST RELATIONSHIP
I HAVE EVER BEEN IN.

11:14.905 --> 11:17.848
SO WE DECIDED THAT IF ONE OF US
MEETS SOMEONE WHO'S SUPER HOT,

11:17.848 --> 11:19.409
WE'RE TOTALLY ALLOWED
TO BANG 'EM--

11:19.409 --> 11:22.813
NO MOUTH KISSING, OF COURSE--
AND IT WON'T EVEN TOUCH US,

11:22.813 --> 11:25.155
BECAUSE OUR CONNECTION
ISTHAT DEEP.

11:25.155 --> 11:28.759
HE EVEN SENT ME
A VIRTUAL PROMISE RING.

11:28.759 --> 11:29.890
WHAT SHOULD I SEND HIM?

11:29.890 --> 11:30.991
YOUR DIGNITY?

11:30.991 --> 11:33.263
OH! OH, I KNOW, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

11:33.263 --> 11:34.995
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.898
IT IS THE ULTIMATE DISPLAY
OF ONLINE TRUST.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.169
"SEND."

11:41.301 --> 11:42.302
(coins clattering)

11:42.302 --> 11:43.333
OOH.

11:43.333 --> 11:44.474
(rattle)

11:44.474 --> 11:45.906
OHH!

11:45.906 --> 11:46.977
(all, high-pitched voices)
в™Є PENNY CAN в™Є

11:46.977 --> 11:48.979
SIG! LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE GOOD AT SOMETHING

11:48.979 --> 11:50.881
OTHER THAN
NOT GETTING LAID.

11:50.881 --> 11:53.243
(laughs)
HE'S KIDDING, SIGGY.

11:53.243 --> 11:56.847
(Bobby, Travis, and Grayson,
low-pitched voice) PENNY PICKUP!

11:56.847 --> 11:59.920
SO YOUR FAMILY JUST SHOWS UP
WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IT?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.222
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
HOW IT WORKS.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.354
(sighs)

12:04.354 --> 12:06.827
HEY, LOOK, TRAV, YOU KNOW
WHY WE REALLY CAME OVER.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.959
I WANT TO ASK OUT
PROFESSOR, UH...

12:08.959 --> 12:10.030
LeCLAIRE?
LeCLAIRE.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.202
YEAH, WELL,
YOU AND PROFESSOR LeCLAIRE--

12:12.202 --> 12:14.434
OBVIOUSLY SUPER TIGHT, BUT--

12:14.434 --> 12:16.937
NOW LET ME FINISH, ALL RIGHT?
YOU COME FIRST.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.268
SHE'S YOUR TEACHER,
AND YOU LOOK UP TO HER,

12:18.268 --> 12:19.910
AND I DON'T WANNA MESS THAT UP.
SO IF YOU WANT ME TO BACK OFF,

12:19.910 --> 12:22.042
YOU JUST SAY THE WORD,
AND I'M... (whistles)

12:22.042 --> 12:24.014
DAD, IF SHE MET YOU, SHE'D KNOW
RIGHT AWAY THAT I WAS CHEATING.

12:24.014 --> 12:26.516
OKAY? BUT LET'S JUST FORGET
ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND.

12:26.516 --> 12:27.747
GOOD. DONE.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.319
PLEASE DON'T DATE
MY TEACHER.

12:30.921 --> 12:32.382
ALL RIGHT, COPY THAT.

12:32.382 --> 12:34.124
THANK YOU.

12:37.988 --> 12:39.259
WHAT...

12:40.390 --> 12:42.092
COULDN'T FIND A HOSE.

12:42.092 --> 12:45.065
OH, AND BY THE WAY, WHILE YOU
WERE LOCKED IN MY HOUSE,

12:45.065 --> 12:48.338
I PUT UP A NEW SIGN.

12:48.338 --> 12:51.271
ALL RIGHT, CAN WE PLEASE
END THIS SILLY THING?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.404
YOU WIN. YOU'RE THE KING
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:54.404 --> 12:56.106
ANDY,
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT THING

12:56.106 --> 12:58.849
WHERE YOU TURN SOMETHING SMALL
INTO SOMETHING SERIOUS.

12:58.849 --> 13:00.210
I'M BEGGING YOU.

13:00.210 --> 13:03.083
I NEVER GET TO BE IN CHARGE
OF ANYTHING IN MY LIFE!

13:03.083 --> 13:04.154
AND HERE WE GO.

13:04.154 --> 13:05.916
AT WORK, I HAVE TO DO
WHATEVER MY CLIENTS WANT,

13:05.916 --> 13:08.358
AND WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE BOSS
OF MY HOME, ME OR ELLIE?

13:08.358 --> 13:09.359
WHO CAN REALLY SAY?

13:09.359 --> 13:10.921
THIS CUL-DE-SAC
IS THE ONE PLACE

13:10.921 --> 13:13.063
WHERE I FELT LIKE
I CALLED THE SHOTS...

13:13.063 --> 13:15.365
AND YOU TOOK THAT
AWAY FROM ME.

13:15.365 --> 13:16.366
ANDY, DON'T GO.

13:16.366 --> 13:17.367
WHY?

13:17.367 --> 13:18.999
BECAUSE I PUT STAN THERE.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.372
(laughs)

13:27.437 --> 13:28.508
OHH.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.081
OH, GOD.
NOT THE SAD SIGH.

13:31.081 --> 13:33.183
IT'S SEXY ON A MAN, ISN'T IT?

13:33.183 --> 13:34.214
COME ON. WE'RE ALL THE SAME.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.146
NONE OF US ARE
IN CHARGE OF ANYTHING.

13:36.146 --> 13:38.188
YOU OWN A SUCCESSFUL
REAL ESTATE COMPANY.

13:38.188 --> 13:39.990
OH, RIGHT. YEAH. GO, JULES.

13:39.990 --> 13:41.251
WHOO.

13:41.251 --> 13:44.855
SORRY. WHAT ABOUT GRAYSON?
HE'S NOT IN CONTROL OF ANYTHING.

13:44.855 --> 13:46.226
SHE'S RIGHT.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.227
WAIT.

13:47.227 --> 13:50.100
HEY! EVERYBODY,
OUT OF MY BAR RIGHT NOW.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.302
I'M SERIOUS. GO.
I'M KIDDING, I'M KIDDING.

13:52.302 --> 13:55.205
I'M SO SORRY. COME BACK.
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.

13:55.205 --> 13:56.466
(giggles)

13:56.466 --> 13:59.539
I'LL JUST ACCEPT
BEING THE WORLD'S BITCH.

14:02.272 --> 14:05.015
MY HEART FEELS
LIKE YOUR SAD FACE.

14:05.015 --> 14:08.348
AND MY FACE FEELS
LIKE YOUR SAD EYES.

14:09.579 --> 14:14.154
AW, POOR "SHORT AND WIDE."
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.256
(sighs deeply)

14:16.256 --> 14:20.290
OH, GOOD GOD.
NOT ANOTHER SAD MAN SIGH.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.892
WHY IS THIS ONE SO DOWN?

14:23.563 --> 14:26.136
LET YOUR DAD
ASK OUT YOUR TEACHER.

14:26.136 --> 14:27.637
WHAT, YOU TOLD ON ME?

14:27.637 --> 14:29.599
I DID,
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.

14:29.599 --> 14:32.242
HEY. SIG.
MY MOM'S HERE NOW.

14:33.303 --> 14:34.344
BYE, SIG.

14:34.344 --> 14:37.447
IT'S TOUGH FOR YOUR DAD.
HE'S LONELY.

14:37.447 --> 14:40.250
PLUS HE'S GOT TO FIND SOMEONE
WHILE HE STILL HAS HIS LOOKS.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.482
COBBS DO NOT AGE WELL.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.655
AFTER 50, IT'S LIKE
A ROCKET SHIP TO DOGVILLE.

14:45.655 --> 14:47.057
WHAT?

14:47.057 --> 14:50.560
RELAX, DUDE. I'M NOT A COBB.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.924
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO BE A GOOD MOM

14:53.924 --> 14:55.195
BY COMING OVER HERE
TO CONVINCE ME

14:55.195 --> 14:57.267
TO LET DAD BANG
MY PHOTOGRAPHY TEACHER,

14:57.267 --> 14:59.299
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY

14:59.299 --> 15:01.201
THAT'S GONNA MAKE ME
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.373
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOUR DAD LIKED SOMEONE?

15:04.975 --> 15:06.436
(clucks tongue)

15:06.436 --> 15:08.508
IS THAT WHAT YOU DO NOW WHEN
HE SAYS SOMETHING ALMOST SMART?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.280
YOU POINT AT HIM LIKE A DOG?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.442
YEAH. SO WHAT? HE LIKES IT.

15:12.442 --> 15:13.443
I DO.

15:13.443 --> 15:15.115
(clucks tongue)

15:15.115 --> 15:18.118
(both chuckle)

15:19.349 --> 15:21.591
ARE YOU DONE
WITH YOUR FUNK, BOO?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.325
(whispers) OH, BROTHER.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.927
(normal voice)
HE'S STARTING TO BURROW.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.960
SO LAME.
(bicycle bell dings)

15:29.960 --> 15:31.631
OH, YEAH.
DON'T LET THEM BOTHER YOU.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.164
SO, UM, DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD GO SEE ANDY?

15:34.164 --> 15:36.266
DON'T. HE'S JUST TRYING
TO MANIPULATE YOU.

15:36.266 --> 15:38.238
I DON'T AGREE.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.370
JULES, IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I'VE LEARNED

15:40.370 --> 15:41.711
IN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH WADE

15:41.711 --> 15:45.415
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT HE IS
INDEED BLACK--HE JUST TOLD ME.

15:45.415 --> 15:46.576
CONGRATS!

15:46.576 --> 15:49.379
THANKS.
I'M SUPER HAPPY ABOUT IT.

15:49.379 --> 15:51.481
ANYWAY, EARLIER TODAY,

15:51.481 --> 15:54.384
I WAS TRYING TO GIVE
MY UNDER-BROWS A LITTLE COLOR

15:54.384 --> 15:56.386
AND I GOT SOME SPRAY TAN
IN MY EYE.

15:56.386 --> 15:58.358
NOW GRANTED,
IT WAS A LITTLE DUMB.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.530
YOU'RE NOT USING
THE WORD "LITTLE" CORRECTLY.

16:00.530 --> 16:03.333
STILL...HE PICKED ME UP,

16:03.333 --> 16:05.265
AND MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO FOR ANDY.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.598
YOU KNOW, PICK HIM UP,
NO MATTER HOW DUMB HE'S BEING.

16:08.598 --> 16:13.373
DON'T YOU DARE TAKE LESSONS FROM
HER AND HER FAKE RELATIONSHIP.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.544
WHAT? YOU DON'T KNOW
IT'S FAKE.

16:14.544 --> 16:17.347
WHAT'S WADE'S LAST NAME?
DUNNO.

16:17.347 --> 16:18.548
WHERE'S HE FROM?
DUNNO.

16:18.548 --> 16:20.380
DID YOU SAY "DUNNO"
OR "DOUGHNUT"?
DUNNO.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.381
WHAT COLOR ARE HIS EYES?
DUNNO.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.113
DOES HE HAVE EYES?
DUNNO.

16:23.113 --> 16:25.015
JULES, SEE, SHE D--

16:25.015 --> 16:26.286
WHERE DID SHE GO?

16:26.286 --> 16:27.557
DUNNO.

16:28.618 --> 16:29.719
ANDY?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.392
YEAH?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.064
I AM SO SORRY.

16:34.064 --> 16:37.067
I NEED YOUR HELP
WITH THE BICYCLE BOYS.

16:37.067 --> 16:41.171
I NEED YOU TO RISE UP AND BE
THE KING THAT WE ALL NEED.

16:41.171 --> 16:42.372
LIKE A...

16:42.372 --> 16:44.334
CUL-DE-SAC BRAVEHEART?

16:44.334 --> 16:46.406
OKAY. LET'S GO. COME ON.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.209
(bicycle wheels spinning)
LOOK, I KNOW THE WAY
I FEEL ABOUT THIS WOMAN

16:49.209 --> 16:52.182
IS CLASSIC IDEALIZATION.

16:52.182 --> 16:54.344
YOU SURPRISED I KNOW
WHAT IDEALIZATION MEANS?

16:54.344 --> 16:56.346
ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
(Ellie and Laurie) YEAH.

16:56.346 --> 16:59.319
ME, TOO. I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW IT GOT IN THERE.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.322
YOU KNOW, I LOOKED HER NAME UP
IN THE COLLEGE DIRECTORY.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.623
IT'S ANGIE.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.694
GOOD NAME.

17:04.694 --> 17:07.057
YEAH. SHE'S FROM FRANCE.

17:07.057 --> 17:08.398
BETTER THAN TAMPA.

17:08.398 --> 17:11.231
BOBBY, IF I CAN FIND WADE,

17:11.231 --> 17:13.703
YOU'RE GONNA FIND
SOMEONE GREAT, TOO.

17:13.703 --> 17:15.105
YOU DIDN'T FIND SOMEONE.

17:15.105 --> 17:17.067
YOU STRIPPED ONLINE
FOR A STRANGER.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.209
THAT'S NOT REAL.
(scoffs)

17:19.209 --> 17:22.112
LET'S READ YOUR TWEETS WITH HIM
FROM LAST NIGHT, SHALL WE?

17:22.112 --> 17:23.113
GO AHEAD.

17:23.113 --> 17:26.376
DIME EYES? READ WITH ME.

17:26.376 --> 17:30.049
"WHAT UP? IT'S HOT
AS BALLENSTEINS IN FLIZORIDA."

17:30.049 --> 17:31.381
(high-pitched voice)
"WHAT, WHAT!"

17:31.381 --> 17:33.183
(normal voice)
I'M READING LAURIE, BY THE WAY.

17:33.183 --> 17:36.356
"I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO MAKE YOU HOTTER RIGHT HERE."

17:36.356 --> 17:38.188
WOW, THIS GETS RAUNCHY FAST.

17:38.188 --> 17:39.359
"I'M GLAD
YOU'RE AROUND TONIGHT."

17:39.359 --> 17:42.292
