01:35.162 --> 01:36.328
Hey!

04:06.947 --> 04:08.413
- Hi!
- Hello.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.615
Uh, Sara Hamilton?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.350
Yeah. That'd be me.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.651
Yeah,
well, this package...

04:14.555 --> 04:15.854
...is for you.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.022
Finally!

04:17.024 --> 04:19.257
I almost gave up waiting for it.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.260
Well, it's all yours,

04:21.261 --> 04:23.261
if I can just get you
to sign right there.

04:23.998 --> 04:25.764
You're a godsend.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.531
If you hadn't turned up today,
it would have been too late.

04:27.534 --> 04:30.435
I knew that.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.537
Why do you think I'm here now?

04:32.539 --> 04:33.872
There you go.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.641
- Thank you, and enjoy...
- Thank you.

04:35.643 --> 04:36.708
...whatever was so important.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.976
I will. Thank you.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.011
Thank you.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.993
Humanity has had
the oddest habit

04:54.995 --> 04:56.695
of turning a blind eye

04:56.697 --> 04:58.430
to anything
that makes it uneasy.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.668
In 1634, Galileo was declared

05:02.670 --> 05:04.770
a heretic for daring to suggest

05:04.772 --> 05:07.572
that it was, in fact, the Earth
that revolved around the Sun

05:07.574 --> 05:09.875
and not the other way round.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.910
And even though
this was one of the most

05:11.912 --> 05:14.613
strongly supported facts
ever disclosed,

05:14.615 --> 05:18.417
that assertion cost him
not only his reputation,

05:18.419 --> 05:20.886
but it also cut him off
from society

05:20.888 --> 05:23.088
right up until the day he died.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.323
For centuries,

05:24.325 --> 05:26.058
thousands upon thousands
of people

05:26.060 --> 05:28.960
have experienced UFO sightings

05:28.962 --> 05:33.031
and various forms of encounters
with extraterrestrials.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.034
Even over 3,000 years ago,

05:36.036 --> 05:39.037
the Mayans depicted
some of these occurrences

05:39.039 --> 05:41.106
in their wall carvings.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.541
But, of course,

05:42.542 --> 05:43.975
it wasn't until
the advent of photography

05:43.977 --> 05:46.078
towards the end
of the 19th century

05:46.080 --> 05:49.114
that we were able
to actually record proof.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.616
Physical proof
of these sightings.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.722
But that was never
gonna be enough.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.392
What with our ingrained
mockery and dupery,

06:00.394 --> 06:02.694
which gave way
to incessant suspicion

06:02.696 --> 06:04.930
and dogma,

06:04.931 --> 06:07.165
which, of course, cast such
an enormous shadow of doubt

06:07.167 --> 06:09.101
all over this proof.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.637
At least for those...

06:12.639 --> 06:15.107
<i>- who chose to turn...</i>
- Hello?

06:15.109 --> 06:16.609
<i>- ...a blind eye.</i>
<i>-  Hi, Sara.</i>

06:16.610 --> 06:18.110
- <i>It's just your mom calling.</i>
- Hi, Mom.

06:18.112 --> 06:20.545
- How are you?
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

06:20.547 --> 06:22.881
Listen, the reason
I'm calling is...

06:22.883 --> 06:25.751
I wondered if you may be free
to come over for lunch tomorrow?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.186
Oh, are you serious?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.722
You know I can't.
I'm going away, you know that.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.857
<i> Sorry, love.</i>

06:31.859 --> 06:34.092
Yes, you did tell me.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.661
I don't know why, I was certain
that was next week.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.196
Oh, no, Mom. It's this weekend.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.066
<i> Couldn't</i>
<i>someone else from the office</i>

06:41.068 --> 06:43.468
at least go with you
to keep you company?

06:43.470 --> 06:45.170
Mom, can we not do this again?

06:45.172 --> 06:47.739
You know, this not work-related.
This is for my book.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.408
I know, Sara.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.710
<i> Mom,</i>
<i>are you hearing yourself?</i>

06:51.712 --> 06:53.879
We're not in the 20s
anymore, okay?

06:53.881 --> 06:55.714
Women can travel
around the world by themselves.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.549
You really need
to accept that already.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.717
<i> You watch</i>
<i>your tone, young lady!</i>

06:58.719 --> 07:01.119
This is your mother
you're talking to.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.654
And you make it sound
like I was around

07:02.656 --> 07:03.922
when dinosaurs ruled the earth.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.226
You are so like your father.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.865
Mom, please tell me
you're not drinking again.

07:13.867 --> 07:14.933
'Course not!

07:16.670 --> 07:18.203
Anyway...

07:19.673 --> 07:20.939
I wasn't gonna bring this up.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.110
But I was speaking to your aunt,

07:25.112 --> 07:27.212
and she said she read
all kinds of weird stories

07:27.214 --> 07:29.181
<i>about that place
you're so intent on visiting.</i>

07:29.183 --> 07:31.016
Oh, Mom, please.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.051
<i> Well, you do</i>
<i>whatever you think you should!</i>

07:34.387 --> 07:35.720
<i>I can least expect
a call from you</i>

07:35.722 --> 07:37.489
<i>as soon as you get there,
though, right?</i>

07:37.491 --> 07:38.568
No, Mom.

07:38.569 --> 07:39.646
There's no signal in the forest,

07:39.647 --> 07:40.724
and I'm pretty sure
there's no Wi-Fi, either.

07:40.727 --> 07:41.693
Okay?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.263
You know what?
I'll... I'll call you

07:45.265 --> 07:47.132
as soon as I get home
on Monday, okay?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.200
All right. Okay.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.270
But please promise me
you'll be careful with the car.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.672
Oh, yes, Mom.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.973
Okay? I'll talk to you soon.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.141
All right. Bye. I love you.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.146
<i> Look.</i>

08:02.182 --> 08:04.483
<i>"And four living creatures</i>

08:04.485 --> 08:07.752
<i>emerged from the center
of the image.</i>

08:07.754 --> 08:08.954
<i>When the creatures moved,</i>

08:08.956 --> 08:11.923
<i>the wheels rolled
along with them.</i>

08:11.925 --> 08:14.793
<i>And when the creatures floated
above the land,</i>

08:14.795 --> 08:17.162
the wheels also floated.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.664
Because the spirit
of those creatures

08:19.666 --> 08:21.299
<i>was in the wheels."</i>

08:23.770 --> 08:25.570
Ezekiel, chapter one.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.741
So, as the prophet predicted,

08:29.743 --> 08:31.676
humanity found itself facing

08:31.678 --> 08:34.246
one of its greatest challenges
to date.

08:34.248 --> 08:37.048
Having to acknowledge
the existence of civilization

08:37.049 --> 08:38.717
from other parts of the galaxy.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.052
We can only hope that this time,

08:41.054 --> 08:43.288
unlike what happened
with Galileo,

08:43.289 --> 08:46.024
we won't have to wait
all of 300 years

08:46.026 --> 08:47.926
to authenticate the veracity

08:47.928 --> 08:51.663
of the unmitigated proof
we will be providing today.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.715
That must be it.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.271
Excuse me.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.107
Um, um, I'm headed
to the military barracks.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.275
Is this the right way?

10:37.337 --> 10:38.653
You'd think God

10:38.654 --> 10:39.970
might at least do something
about our appearance,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.674
and that... damn foul smell

10:42.676 --> 10:44.309
when our souls
finally abandon us, right?

10:45.812 --> 10:47.312
It's definitely not one
of his stronger points.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.048
Twenty years on the force,

10:50.050 --> 10:53.318
and the smell doesn't get
any kinder on the senses.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.953
I don't know
how you do put up with it.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.221
No different
to a deer or a boar.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.255
You say so.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.462
I just about
had enough of it, Joe.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.465
This has got to be the only
nature reserve in the world

11:07.467 --> 11:10.268
where the damn bears
choose not to hibernate.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.670
What can I say...

11:11.672 --> 11:13.204
The unpredictable mysteries
of nature.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.589
Yeah, well, a fucking truce
over the winter

11:14.590 --> 11:15.973
would be doing everyone
a favor, now, wouldn't it?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.043
Sure, but like I already said,

11:18.045 --> 11:20.045
the temperature affects
their behavior.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.713
And besides,
people know all well and good

11:21.715 --> 11:22.747
the danger
they're putting themselves in

11:22.749 --> 11:24.282
by coming out here.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.151
There are warning signs
at every entrance.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.653
Not to mention
the permit you need

11:27.654 --> 11:29.154
before you're even allowed
to step foot in this place.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.823
Yeah, fucking waste of time,
if you ask me.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.325
I don't why you all get off
on that red tape bullshit.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.033
Well...

11:42.035 --> 11:43.902
Looks like you've got your work
cut out for you.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.404
You'd best get on with it.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.007
Yeah, I best had.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.309
Um...

11:52.479 --> 11:53.878
You'll have to excuse me.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.783
Call me or come find me
whenever you want.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.518
<i> Mi casa su casa,</i>
and all of that.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.753
Yeah, right.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.493
Moron! How many times
I've got to tell you?

12:08.495 --> 12:09.728
No taking photos around me.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.362
Get the fuck outta here, now!

12:11.364 --> 12:12.797
It's okay, boss. It's okay.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.065
Jesus Christ!

13:21.334 --> 13:22.967
Oh, my god

13:22.969 --> 13:24.803
Oh, my god.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.473
You're Joe, right?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.308
Uh, yeah.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.477
You must be the journalist?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.345
Yeah. Something tells me
you knew that

13:34.347 --> 13:36.214
before you scared
the hell out of me, Ranger.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.119
"Sara Hamilton."

13:41.121 --> 13:43.154
- Yup, that'd be me.
- Good.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.156
Well, it's great to see
you've brought your permit

13:45.158 --> 13:46.324
and turned up on time.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.959
I wish everyone else
would take a leaf

13:47.961 --> 13:49.194
out of your book.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.428
Yeah, well,
I had no other choice.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.297
Some guy on the phone
gave me strict instructions.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.132
Otherwise, there was no way
I was getting in here.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.400
Yeah.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.136
Uh, that guy on the phone
might have been me.

14:00.456 --> 14:02.039
Well, you can't be too careful,
you know?

14:02.042 --> 14:03.441
Uh, sometimes people
are too smart

14:03.443 --> 14:04.876
for their own good,

14:04.877 --> 14:06.310
and they only realize
once it's too late.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.314
Yeah, I got you.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.182
We need to know
when people are gonna be here,

14:11.184 --> 14:14.018
so we can be around
to keep watch over you.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.054
Contrary to what
most people believe,

14:16.056 --> 14:18.656
the biggest obstacle
isn't getting in here.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.992
It's getting out...

14:22.262 --> 14:23.494
alive.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.163
Yeah. The bears?

14:25.165 --> 14:26.564
Exactly.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.600
Yeah. I saw the commotion
on the river bank.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.137
Well, I hope
the man upstairs

14:33.139 --> 14:35.006
doesn't give us any problems.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.876
I think we'll be okay.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.645
But we're gonna start
inside, so...

14:40.647 --> 14:42.080
you don't have anything
to worry about.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.148
Great!

14:44.150 --> 14:45.516
What do you say
we do this already?

14:45.518 --> 14:46.651
I'll follow you.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.356
So, what do you think
of this so far?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.325
It's amazing.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.927
Can't wait to get inside.

14:59.449 --> 15:01.266
Something tells me you're not
gonna be disappointed.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.096
Humans need something
to hold onto, you know?

15:32.098 --> 15:33.164
And when it's something
you can't

15:33.166 --> 15:34.299
quite get your head round...

15:36.185 --> 15:37.668
...you take your own ignorance
as the truth.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.706
Well, that's a lovely
philosophy, Joe.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.541
But there must have been
documented cases

15:43.543 --> 15:46.044
of sightings and contact
before what happened.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.362
Well, sure.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.679
But there's no actual proof
of anything

15:48.682 --> 15:50.148
from the moment
the barracks were built

15:50.150 --> 15:52.050
until they were abandoned.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.384
Official records, you mean?

15:53.386 --> 15:54.986
Well, yeah.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.654
I couldn't tell you
about anything off the record.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.125
Although, I guess
I gotta warn you,

16:01.127 --> 16:03.561
strange things still happen here
now and again.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.338
Shit.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.341
What's going on?

16:16.343 --> 16:17.542
Okay, just keep quiet.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.410
What?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.145
Oh, my god.

16:26.086 --> 16:30.054
Okay, Sara just do exactly
as I say.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.222
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.559
Now, on three,

16:34.561 --> 16:36.794
I want you to run out
of the forest as fast as you can

16:36.796 --> 16:38.029
towards the barracks,

16:38.031 --> 16:39.097
as if your life depended on it.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.782
Wait. What about you?

16:40.783 --> 16:42.466
No, don't ask questions now,
for god's sake, Sara.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.335
Okay? Just run.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.137
And no matter what you hear,

16:46.139 --> 16:48.573
don't look back. You hear me?

16:48.575 --> 16:51.342
- No looking back.
- Okay. Okay.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.644
One...

16:53.646 --> 16:56.180
Two...

16:57.684 --> 16:59.617
Three. Run, Sara! Run!

17:02.422 --> 17:04.321
Fuck. Fuck, fuck!

17:10.030 --> 17:11.095
Help!

17:14.634 --> 17:16.067
Help!

17:21.107 --> 17:22.205
Come on!

17:22.208 --> 17:23.374
Come out here!

17:23.376 --> 17:24.675
You don't get the balls, do you?

17:27.814 --> 17:30.048
Couldn't you have picked
a better time?

17:30.050 --> 17:31.716
Can't you see we've got guests?

17:34.487 --> 17:35.553
Come on! Come out here!

17:36.523 --> 17:39.057
Where the hell are you?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.491
You still haven't learned
who makes the fucking rules

17:40.493 --> 17:41.592
around here, have you?

17:53.206 --> 17:55.373
Oh, god. Oh, god.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.189
Shit.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.641
Oh, my god!

18:32.312 --> 18:33.511
You're a

18:33.513 --> 18:34.846
- fucking savage bastard!
- Joe! Joe!

18:34.847 --> 18:36.180
- Joe! Watch out, watch out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:36.182 --> 18:37.882
Jesus, what the fuck...

18:37.884 --> 18:39.250
Jesus, Ed!

18:39.252 --> 18:40.318
What?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.255
You know him?

18:44.257 --> 18:46.724
Yeah, of course, I do.
Everybody does. It's Ed.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.292
Didn't I mention him earlier?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.228
No. No, you didn't.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.931
Oh. Well, he's as weird
as they come, but...

18:53.933 --> 18:55.666
his heart is in the right place,
isn't it, buddy?

18:59.405 --> 19:01.672
- Jesus, Joe!
- Yeah.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.875
I caught it on the iron rails
on the fence.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.810
We need to get you
to a hospital!

19:05.812 --> 19:06.911
It's nothing.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.549
What...

19:11.551 --> 19:12.650
Yeah, all right.
Whatever you say.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.168
Where's he going?

19:14.169 --> 19:15.685
Uh, he's got
a first aid kit in his hut.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.755
He's gonna stitch it up for me.
Come on!

19:17.757 --> 19:19.824
You're joking, right?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.192
No.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.593
It's not the first time, either.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.162
These sort of things happen
all the time.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.831
Come on!

19:26.833 --> 19:28.299
He lives down there?

19:28.301 --> 19:29.667
No, of course not.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.269
He lives in a caravan
in the forest,

19:31.271 --> 19:33.371
on the other side
of the barracks.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.239
But if we go this way,

19:35.241 --> 19:36.374
we avoid having to deal

19:36.376 --> 19:38.376
with that friend
of ours outside again.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.677
Yeah.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.946
And we're just gonna
go down there, just like that?

19:41.948 --> 19:44.749
Come on.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.751
It'll be more fun this way.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.252
Yeah.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.367
You could say Ed's
the real keeper of this castle.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.971
He scares prying eyes away.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.773
Even the damn bears
are scared of him.

20:10.476 --> 20:13.411
But... What is he?
Mute or something?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.947
Uh, not exactly.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.415
He's just...

20:17.417 --> 20:19.483
...not the most talkative
of people.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.718
But he's quite the erudite.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.886
You'll see.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.895
Here's where
the officer's rooms were.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.631
And at the far end,

20:33.633 --> 20:35.466
Command and Captaincy offices.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.512
And why was there a nursery?

20:49.315 --> 20:51.382
Oh.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.450
Some of the higher officers
lived here with their families.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.822
There were stories

20:57.824 --> 21:00.524
about how women became
more fertile in this forest.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.761
It was a pretty productive time
for some of them.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.996
Yeah.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.568
Come on.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.802
You're gonna like this.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.600
Ah, leave it out,
will you?

21:42.602 --> 21:43.834
Let me show her.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.469
Come on.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.310
What's his problem now?

21:52.312 --> 21:53.377
Ah, nothing.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.913
He's just
over meticulous is all.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.349
See?

21:58.351 --> 22:00.318
This was how they got
to the higher floors.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.523
Up there was the library,

22:05.525 --> 22:06.757
the living room,
and the bedrooms

22:06.759 --> 22:08.392
for the noncommissioned
officers.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.961
And down there?

22:10.963 --> 22:12.096
Hell.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.533
That actually
wouldn't surprise me.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.070
Yeah, well,
the gateway at least.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.138
Dr. Marshall's
molecular biology lab

22:21.140 --> 22:23.407
and the weapons tunnel
were on the lower floors.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.976
And...

22:25.978 --> 22:28.512
if you stick your head in there
for a few seconds,

22:28.514 --> 22:30.915
you can still hear the screams
of the long-lost souls

22:30.917 --> 22:32.350
who were trapped down there.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.420
You're making fun of me,
aren't you?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.156
You be the judge.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.570
Oh, my god, Joe.

22:52.572 --> 22:53.671
What the hell is that?

22:55.074 --> 22:57.408
I told you weird things
still happen around here.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.096
Dude, what's really down there?

23:02.097 --> 23:03.780
'Cause if you're not making
this up, I'm leaving right now.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.585
Yeah, right, we're coming.
Keep your hat on.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.655
He wants us to get a move on,
but pay no attention.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.759
Well, true or not,

23:14.761 --> 23:16.627
it's probably not the best idea

23:16.629 --> 23:19.029
to be walking around here
on your own.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.565
But I will put you
out of your misery,

23:21.567 --> 23:23.434
and I will tell you what it is.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.069
Yeah, something
that makes sense, please.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.071
I'm serious!

23:28.207 --> 23:30.574
And by the way,

23:30.576 --> 23:32.576
do you really understand
everything that he says?

23:33.146 --> 23:34.445
Um...

23:35.415 --> 23:37.081
How do I explain this?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.149
Let me break it down.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.918
Have you ever had a dog?

23:40.920 --> 23:43.053
Yeah, when I was a kid.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.121
Chewie.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.456
He was part
of the family.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.591
Okay.
And even though Chewie,

23:47.593 --> 23:49.026
all he ever did was bark,

23:49.028 --> 23:51.562
you still understood
everything he said, right?

23:51.564 --> 23:52.730
Yeah.

23:52.732 --> 23:53.864
Exactly!

23:53.866 --> 23:55.433
Well, imagine if you've had

23:55.435 --> 23:57.968
a chance to share
a couple of beers with him.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.037
I'm sure
your canine communication skills

24:00.039 --> 24:01.572
would have reached
all new levels.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.141
Well, I never thought
about it like that.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.178
That's what I was trying
to say earlier.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.314
More often than not,

24:09.315 --> 24:11.449
the truth is actually a lot
less complicated than it seems.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.550
You see,

24:12.552 --> 24:14.018
that's what I was
getting at earlier

24:14.020 --> 24:15.619
when we talked
about all those rumors

24:15.621 --> 24:16.954
that were flying around.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.022
Yeah. And...

24:18.024 --> 24:19.690
What about those cries
we just heard?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.225
Exactly.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.927
What about those cries?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.664
That's just the sound
of the north wind blowing

24:26.666 --> 24:29.099
through the ventilation ducts
on the lower levels.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.935
Well, that scared
the shit out of me.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.573
Imagination can be
a man's worst friend.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.808
Isn't that right, Ed?

24:47.587 --> 24:48.986
Time to visit
the underworld, then?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.888
Uh, not yet.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.991
This is an exit
that leads directly outside.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.797
<i> The Tetis Region</i>
<i>was one of the hot spots</i>

24:59.799 --> 25:02.800
<i>where various UFO activity
was witnessed,</i>

25:02.802 --> 25:06.270
<i>following the Cosmic Call
as a result of the power burst</i>

25:06.272 --> 25:10.608
<i>caused by the Hiroshima
and Nagasaki bombs.</i>

25:10.610 --> 25:15.679
<i>One of the most bizarre
UFO occurrences ever recorded</i>

25:15.681 --> 25:18.516
<i>took place right here.</i>

25:18.518 --> 25:21.752
<i>On October 15th, 1946,</i>

25:21.754 --> 25:24.655
a manned alien ship crashed

25:24.657 --> 25:27.992
in the rocky mountain range
you can see behind me.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.227
The military swiftly moved in,

25:30.229 --> 25:33.864
a 25-kilometer radius
extending from the crash site

25:33.866 --> 25:36.567
was declared
off-limits to civilians.

25:36.569 --> 25:40.871
It was impossible to gain access
to this forest

25:40.873 --> 25:43.741
for the four decades

25:43.742 --> 25:46.610
that the now abandoned
military reserve was operating.

25:46.612 --> 25:49.346
But, on that October evening,

25:49.348 --> 25:52.750
before the military even arrived
on the scene,

25:52.752 --> 25:57.187
a local witnessed the event,
and he took a photograph.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.061
That photograph
was published in the media,

26:04.063 --> 26:06.130
which caused
the government to launch

26:06.132 --> 26:11.802
a relentless campaign rejecting
and debunking the proof.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.805
Now, in the photograph
taken by the civilian,

26:14.807 --> 26:18.142
we can see the image
of the flying saucer

26:18.144 --> 26:23.013
and two human-shaped figures
lying on the ground

26:23.015 --> 26:24.715
whose body measurements

26:24.717 --> 26:28.018
deviate considerably
from the human norm.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.354
The official version

26:30.356 --> 26:33.290
attributed the event
to a military jet,

26:33.292 --> 26:37.895
which crashed during training,
caused by rotational energy.

26:37.897 --> 26:42.266
Accordingly, society mourned
the death of these two pilots,

26:42.268 --> 26:43.867
whose charred cadavers

26:43.869 --> 26:46.870
were said to have been retrieved
near the fuselage.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.639
Hmm.

26:50.943 --> 26:55.012
So, what became
of this third figure?

26:59.418 --> 27:01.185
When they wake up
after the winter lethargy,

27:01.187 --> 27:02.820
they have one hell
of an appetite

27:02.822 --> 27:05.155
and are seriously
sexually active.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.024
It's their mating season,
so they turn aggressive

27:07.026 --> 27:08.993
because of how few
females there are.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.229
And why are there
so few females?

27:13.766 --> 27:15.799
I guess we'll have to ask
the man upstairs.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.387
The thing is, they think

27:19.388 --> 27:21.372
they're the fucking kings
of the jungle, you know?

27:21.374 --> 27:23.073
No respect for us humans.

27:35.688 --> 27:36.887
Sara?

27:38.924 --> 27:40.758
Come over to me. It's okay.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.062
Come over here.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.465
Ed?

27:50.002 --> 27:51.101
Your friend's back.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.407
Okay, okay.

27:56.409 --> 27:57.941
Follow, Ed, okay?

27:57.943 --> 27:59.276
It's gonna be okay, I swear.

27:59.278 --> 28:00.344
Okay.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.379
Go, Sara, go!

28:09.388 --> 28:11.855
You heard the boss complaining,
didn't you, you bastard?

28:12.725 --> 28:14.358
Huh?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.060
Well, you're gonna be in trouble
if he finds out.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.830
You're done for, you hear me?

28:19.832 --> 28:21.031
You're done for!

28:30.509 --> 28:31.709
You think he's gonna be okay?

29:01.373 --> 29:02.506
Oh, my...

29:02.508 --> 29:03.807
Oh, my god, Joe.

29:03.809 --> 29:04.975
I thought you
weren't coming back.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.043
I'm okay. Don't worry.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.278
Okay.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.379
Now this...

29:09.381 --> 29:11.181
this they do
show little respect to.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.184
I think it's run off home.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.454
Ed!

29:17.456 --> 29:19.323
You can get your sewing kit
out now, buddy.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.296
Where are you going now?

29:26.298 --> 29:28.332
Jesus, Ed.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.917
Leave it!

29:29.918 --> 29:31.501
Ed, I know what you're like,
and you'll both get hurt.

29:32.838 --> 29:34.204
Hey!

29:34.206 --> 29:37.207
Okay, do it your way, yeah?

29:37.209 --> 29:40.010
Same as always!

29:40.012 --> 29:41.478
Yeah, you can do
all the explaining later, huh?

29:46.051 --> 29:47.785
- Is he going to kill it?
- No.

29:48.788 --> 29:51.021
Well, at least I hope not.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.924
He's gonna teach it a lesson
in his own particular way.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.058
Shouldn't you go with him?

29:56.262 --> 29:57.427
Well...

29:58.130 --> 29:59.963
Oh. No hurry.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.535
Do you want me
to help you with...

30:04.537 --> 30:05.903
Mmm, no.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.271
It's okay. Thanks.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.074
Um, I can probably do
a brushing up

30:11.076 --> 30:12.976
of my sewing skills
after last time.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.154
Joe, can I take... a look?

30:24.156 --> 30:26.156
Yeah, yeah, of course.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.542
While the cat's away.

30:28.543 --> 30:30.927
I mean, Ed doesn't really like
people meddling with his stuff.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.273
You said, Dr. Marshal
was in charge of the lab, right?

30:43.275 --> 30:45.409
Yep, he was.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.044
And...

30:49.582 --> 30:50.881
...he was Ed's dad.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.483
He was what now?

30:53.485 --> 30:56.286
Yeah. You heard me.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.488
Ed was born and bred
in these here woods.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.924
He's oblivious to the world
outside the forest.

31:00.926 --> 31:01.992
Hence, his...

31:03.778 --> 31:05.261
...kindred relationship
with the wildlife.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.437
Everyone just assumed
he disappeared

31:13.439 --> 31:15.439
in the explosion that...

31:15.441 --> 31:16.506
...killed his parents

31:16.508 --> 31:18.342
and destroyed
the military barracks.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.044
But he was hiding in the woods,

31:21.046 --> 31:22.412
and grew up
living like a caveman.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.182
But what about his family?

31:25.184 --> 31:28.452
Didn't he have
uncles or grandparents?

31:29.288 --> 31:31.021
Someone?

31:31.023 --> 31:33.156
Yeah.

31:33.158 --> 31:34.658
I guess there must've
been someone,

31:36.028 --> 31:38.262
but this was
the only world he knew.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.207
That's the embroidery done.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.218
Yeah.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.619
I guess he just
didn't wanna leave

32:02.621 --> 32:05.088
his memories behind, you know?

32:05.090 --> 32:08.392
And he probably felt
it was his responsibility

32:08.394 --> 32:09.927
to carry on his dad's work.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.595
Can I take a look?

32:13.499 --> 32:15.432
You're a reporter
with a scientific bent, too?

32:16.669 --> 32:17.734
Yeah, of course.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.371
No secrets here.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.006
At least until
Ed gets back anyway.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.350
Uh...

32:33.352 --> 32:35.719
Stay here and don't worry.
I'll be right back.

32:36.655 --> 32:37.721
Ed?

32:39.224 --> 32:41.058
Ed?

32:41.060 --> 32:42.359
Where the hell
are you, buddy?

33:30.175 --> 33:31.708
Hello?

33:31.710 --> 33:33.510
Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.245
What the fuck is that?

33:35.547 --> 33:36.680
Joe!

33:37.349 --> 33:38.782
Joe!

33:50.696 --> 33:52.496
Joe!

34:03.642 --> 34:05.075
Joe!

34:11.250 --> 34:12.482
Show, motherfuck!

34:53.792 --> 34:55.125
<i> Sara?</i>

34:56.495 --> 34:57.594
<i>Sara?</i>

35:01.834 --> 35:02.866
Sara?

35:08.540 --> 35:10.307
Sara, wake up. Come on!

35:10.309 --> 35:11.441
Sara, can you hear me?

35:13.912 --> 35:15.312
Have some water. It'll help.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.586
Oh!

35:22.588 --> 35:24.521
Thank you.

35:24.523 --> 35:25.755
I couldn't find you anywhere.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.542
What?

35:28.543 --> 35:30.393
Uh, I walked past here
like ten minutes ago

35:30.395 --> 35:31.461
and you weren't here.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.663
I don't know where you were.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.298
What I'm saying is,

35:35.300 --> 35:37.234
I think we've just experienced
an encounter...

35:38.537 --> 35:40.403
- of the fourth fucking kind.
- Fuck.

35:40.405 --> 35:41.571
Do you know
what that means?

35:41.573 --> 35:43.573
An abduction!

35:43.575 --> 35:45.208
Oh! Whoa, whoa.

35:45.210 --> 35:46.543
Whoa. Whoa.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.912
- What is it?
- Oh, my god. I don't know.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.380
Oh, that hurts!

35:51.683 --> 35:53.517
- Oh!
- Joe.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.152
What the fuck is this?

35:55.154 --> 35:57.220
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my... Oh, my god.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.189
Oh, my...

35:59.191 --> 36:00.323
I'm gonna try again.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.861
Zenith to Base, do you copy?

36:07.399 --> 36:09.166
Zenith to Base, do you copy?

36:09.801 --> 36:10.867
Fuck!

36:10.869 --> 36:13.637
Fuck! Fucking technology!

36:13.639 --> 36:15.472
I've tried, like, 20 times
and nothing. It's fried.

36:17.709 --> 36:18.875
What happened to Ed?

36:19.545 --> 36:21.178
I don't know.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.812
I lost track of him
after the gunshots.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.447
I can't remember anything else.

36:24.449 --> 36:25.682
I woke up back over there.

36:27.252 --> 36:28.318
And, Sara...

36:29.655 --> 36:31.388
there's a mark on my ankle, too.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.393
You too!

36:38.630 --> 36:40.797
We've got to get out of here,
we're way too exposed.

36:40.799 --> 36:41.932
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.274
Okay.

36:51.276 --> 36:52.876
- I know somewhere safer.
- Okay.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.612
Wait! Wait, wait.

36:55.614 --> 36:56.947
Where's my camera?

36:56.949 --> 36:58.014
Where's my camera?

36:58.016 --> 36:59.549
I got it, I got it, I got it.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.753
Hey.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.291
We've gotta go back
to the barracks.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.326
Okay.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.946
It's okay.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.881
Come on.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.286
Okay.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.320
Just rest here.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.323
Okay.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.929
Okay.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.999
Just try and relax,
and wait for me here, okay?

38:23.001 --> 38:24.067
Joe.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.302
I'm gonna go check it out first.

38:25.304 --> 38:26.536
Please, please be careful,
please?

38:28.440 --> 38:29.506
Hey.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.508
It's okay.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.609
Yeah?

38:32.611 --> 38:33.843
I'll be literally two minutes.

38:45.757 --> 38:46.890
Fuck.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.826
The fuck have you done to me?

38:57.903 --> 38:59.069
Must have dropped it.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.015
Hello?

39:13.151 --> 39:14.584
Hello?

39:19.524 --> 39:20.990
Shit.

39:23.562 --> 39:24.627
Fuck.

39:32.404 --> 39:33.703
<i> All right,</i>
<i>here we are again.</i>

39:33.705 --> 39:35.138
<i> I know. On the way.</i>

39:35.140 --> 39:37.574
<i> I hate these bumps.</i>

39:37.576 --> 39:39.609
I hate that there's bumps
in the middle of the road.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.878
Some people like you
will slow down.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.880
- I always slow down.
- Yeah, I know.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.049
I just think
that we take things for granted.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.384
You know, it's as if

39:47.386 --> 39:48.685
people think
they're gonna live forever,

39:48.687 --> 39:50.019
but that's not the case.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.588
- What?
- I mean, things can end

39:51.590 --> 39:52.655
at any moment.

39:52.657 --> 39:54.307
And take us, for example.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.958
I mean, there's a purpose
for why we're in this car.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.494
Yeah, of course,
there's a reason.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.162
We went
to the same school together.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.164
Oh, stop being a shithead, Will.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.900
I mean, I read about this
in one of those self-help books,

40:03.902 --> 40:06.836
and it says that it's nothing
but a simple countdown.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.505
You read way too much.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.510
Every day wasted
is like a slap in the face

40:13.512 --> 40:15.445
- to your dreams.
- What...

40:15.447 --> 40:17.113
<i> Hello?</i>

40:17.115 --> 40:18.848
What's going on?

40:18.850 --> 40:20.650
It is, and while
there's no predicting it,

40:20.652 --> 40:23.653
our time here can run out
when least expected.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.188
Bullshit, woman!

40:25.190 --> 40:27.023
What do you mean "bullshit"?

40:27.025 --> 40:28.658
Do you know
where my dreams start and end?

40:28.660 --> 40:29.726
Where?

40:29.728 --> 40:32.312
On the sofa.

40:32.313 --> 40:34.897
Watching a game of football
and sipping an ice-cold beer.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.434
- Hm.
- And I can tell right now,

40:37.436 --> 40:39.469
that's something
I'll never be late for.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.904
Ah, you're hopeless.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.841
<i> Hello... Hello?</i>

40:44.843 --> 40:46.643
- What's that?
<i>-  Can anybody hear me?</i>

40:46.645 --> 40:48.945
Oh, fuck! Again.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.547
<i> ...encounter</i>
<i>near the old barracks.</i>

40:50.549 --> 40:51.681
<i>Help me!</i>

40:53.151 --> 40:55.084
<i> Someone just help me,</i>
<i>please!</i>

40:56.755 --> 40:57.921
<i>Help!</i>

40:57.923 --> 40:59.255
- <i>Joe!</i>
- Looks like those damned bears

40:59.257 --> 41:01.057
have gone too far this time.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.792
Well, they don't seem
too concerned about it.

41:02.794 --> 41:03.993
They have the department.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.129
Well, if it's up to me,

41:06.131 --> 41:09.466
I'd sort that shit out
right away.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.634
Base, this is 03,
do you read me?

41:14.539 --> 41:17.073
We have a possible code 86
out by the old barracks.

41:17.075 --> 41:18.875
Repeat. Possible code 86.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.176
How shall we proceed? Over.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.480
You know what?
Let's just head over there.

41:24.483 --> 41:25.648
That's good. Yeah.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.484
I'll enjoy catching
that cuddly toy.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.620
And when I do,

41:30.622 --> 41:32.188
I'll blow its brains out.

41:35.260 --> 41:38.595
Base, this is 03,
awaiting instructions.

41:38.597 --> 41:39.729
Do you read me?

41:41.533 --> 41:43.066
<i> Affirmative 03.</i>

41:43.068 --> 41:45.101
<i>Old barracks
and surrounding area,</i>

41:45.103 --> 41:46.503
<i>off-limits.</i>

41:46.505 --> 41:48.505
<i>Please proceed
with your normal route.</i>

41:48.507 --> 41:49.572
<i>Over and out.</i>

41:54.279 --> 41:55.912
Copy that, base.
Standing down.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.731
What?

41:57.732 --> 41:59.549
We will proceed
with the normal route.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.653
You know, like I said, it's like
they don't give a shit.

42:05.290 --> 42:07.056
Well, I...

42:07.058 --> 42:08.858
I don't... I don't know
if we should continue.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.543
What?

42:10.544 --> 42:12.227
If we don't go, they'll just
turn up when it's too late.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.830
Like they always do.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.734
Hey, you know
I'm always careful.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.658
Joe! Joe!

42:41.660 --> 42:43.159
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

42:43.161 --> 42:44.411
- Don't leave me alone.
- It's okay.

42:44.412 --> 42:45.662
- Don't leave me alone.
- It's okay. It's okay.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.330
You're okay. Yeah?

42:47.332 --> 42:51.134
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to find something, but...

42:51.136 --> 42:52.835
Let's go. Come on.
You can come with me.

42:54.072 --> 42:55.204
It's okay.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.108
It tried
to attack me, Joe.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.810
Where are we going?

43:02.314 --> 43:04.113
Into hell, Sara.

43:04.115 --> 43:05.915
This time, for real.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.784
Are you sure
we're safer in there?

43:08.954 --> 43:09.986
I think so.

43:39.084 --> 43:41.017
That son of a bitch
is back.

43:41.019 --> 43:43.820
Come on, quickly.

43:56.167 --> 43:57.367
Can you manage?

43:57.369 --> 43:59.068
Yeah. Yeah.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.403
But I don't know
where I'm going.

44:05.276 --> 44:06.409
- Shit. Shit!
- What?

44:06.411 --> 44:07.443
Joe!

44:08.713 --> 44:09.779
Joe!

44:09.781 --> 44:10.880
- Motherfucker. I'm...
- Joe!

44:10.882 --> 44:12.081
Joe...

44:12.083 --> 44:13.783
Joe! What the fuck is going on?

44:16.054 --> 44:17.687
Joe! Please!

44:29.717 --> 44:31.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

44:31.169 --> 44:32.368
It's me. It's okay.

44:32.370 --> 44:34.270
Hey...

44:34.272 --> 44:36.139
Hey, don't worry.
We're gonna be okay. Yeah?

44:36.141 --> 44:37.206
Okay.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.307
Oh!

44:39.477 --> 44:41.044
We're gonna keep going.
Come on.

45:29.794 --> 45:31.360
I don't know about this, Joe.

45:31.362 --> 45:33.196
Sara, come on. Trust me.

45:33.198 --> 45:34.263
It's gonna be okay.

45:53.717 --> 45:55.183
That was not
a fucking bear, Joe.

45:59.424 --> 46:00.556
No.

46:00.558 --> 46:02.358
That was not a fucking bear.

46:03.228 --> 46:04.293
Come on.

46:06.798 --> 46:08.097
Do you hear those cries?

46:08.833 --> 46:10.366
Yeah.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.468
I think they're coming
from over there.

46:12.470 --> 46:14.403
Yeah. Well, that's the direction
we're headed in.

46:14.405 --> 46:16.038
- Okay.
- The north tunnel runs directly

46:16.040 --> 46:17.306
to the vehicle entrance.

47:00.618 --> 47:02.485
Hey. Over there.

47:03.154 --> 47:04.570
Where?

47:04.571 --> 47:05.987
Behind those bushes.
Don't you see it?

47:07.392 --> 47:09.826
Will, I don't see anything.

47:09.828 --> 47:11.294
Don't worry, Sam.

47:11.296 --> 47:14.030
Leave me to deal with this.
All right?

47:14.032 --> 47:16.132
I bet that son of a bitch
is about to catch that girl.

47:18.069 --> 47:20.369
Will, I think we should call
for backup.

47:20.371 --> 47:22.538
How the fuck are we gonna call
for backup now?

47:22.540 --> 47:23.639
Huh?

47:23.641 --> 47:26.008
That's the last thing
we can do...

47:26.010 --> 47:27.476
You brought me here, right?

47:27.478 --> 47:29.011
- I know, but...
- Yeah. Well, let me finish

47:29.013 --> 47:30.963
what we started, then.

47:30.964 --> 47:32.914
Will, this is crazy.
We should call for backup.

48:18.162 --> 48:19.195
This is all wrong.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.706
Base, this is 03.
Do you read me?

48:34.212 --> 48:36.545
Base, this is 03.
Do you read me?

48:39.918 --> 48:42.618
Requesting backup for a code 86.

48:42.620 --> 48:44.186
<i> Receiving you, 03.</i>

48:44.188 --> 48:45.621
<i>Stay in the vehicle.</i>

48:45.623 --> 48:48.024
<i>You should have proceeded
with your normal route.</i>

48:48.026 --> 48:50.059
<i>We're sending backup. Over.</i>

49:09.113 --> 49:10.479
Hey.

49:10.481 --> 49:12.448
Where are you? Huh?

49:12.450 --> 49:14.116
I know you're there.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.418
You wanna piece of me,
don't you?

49:15.420 --> 49:16.485
Huh?

49:17.488 --> 49:19.355
Come on!

49:19.357 --> 49:21.123
Son of a bitch!
I know you're there.

49:21.392 --> 49:22.491
Hey!

49:22.493 --> 49:25.161
What? Where the fuck
are you? Huh?

49:25.163 --> 49:27.229
Come on. Come on!

49:27.231 --> 49:29.398
I know you're there. Help!

49:29.400 --> 49:31.600
Fuck! What the fuck is that?

49:31.602 --> 49:33.469
You wanna piece of me,
don't you? Eh?

49:44.182 --> 49:45.365
Ahh!

49:46.551 --> 49:48.017
Oh, my god.

49:51.422 --> 49:52.555
Will!

50:12.710 --> 50:14.043
Are you okay?

50:15.013 --> 50:17.113
Yeah.

50:17.115 --> 50:18.481
Yeah. I'm sorry.

50:18.483 --> 50:19.832
What's wrong with me?

50:19.833 --> 50:21.182
Hey, don't worry.
It's probably just nerves.

50:24.389 --> 50:26.555
I'm sorry, Sara,
but we've gotta keep moving.

50:26.557 --> 50:27.790
I know.

50:27.792 --> 50:29.558
I know. I'm okay. Let's go.

50:47.345 --> 50:48.611
Joe.

50:48.613 --> 50:50.112
That's Ed?

50:50.515 --> 50:51.614
No.

50:51.616 --> 50:53.416
- Oh, my...
- It can't be.

50:53.418 --> 50:55.001
I knew...

50:55.002 --> 50:56.585
I knew there was something wrong
with him when I saw him.

50:56.587 --> 50:58.137
I knew it.

50:58.138 --> 50:59.688
There's no way, Sara.
There has to be an explanation.

50:59.690 --> 51:01.857
Then why aren't you shouting
and running over to him?

51:01.859 --> 51:04.260
Because I can't be
so sure now, either.

51:04.262 --> 51:06.162
Men are so clueless sometimes.

51:14.138 --> 51:15.805
That's the fucking thing
that attacked me, Joe.

51:15.807 --> 51:18.541
- Oh, my god!
- Run, Sara. Run!

51:18.543 --> 51:21.310
Oh, my god, Joe!
What the fuck was that?

51:29.253 --> 51:30.719
No!

51:37.795 --> 51:39.228
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:39.230 --> 51:41.464
Whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

51:41.466 --> 51:43.499
- Sorry, I can't help...
- It's okay. It's okay.

51:43.501 --> 51:45.334
Hey. It's okay.

51:46.337 --> 51:47.603
Hey.

51:47.605 --> 51:49.138
It's okay.

51:49.140 --> 51:50.306
We're safe. We're safe.

51:51.576 --> 51:52.641
You can.

51:52.643 --> 51:53.809
You can.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.711
We're gonna be okay, yeah?

51:55.713 --> 51:57.713
I'm gonna get us out of here.

51:59.283 --> 52:00.583
We're gonna get out of here.

52:00.585 --> 52:01.650
Yeah?

52:01.652 --> 52:02.718
Yeah.

52:48.633 --> 52:50.466
What?

53:40.518 --> 53:41.784
Will!

54:26.831 --> 54:28.764
God!

54:39.277 --> 54:41.277
<i> And the images</i>
<i>we're about to see</i>

54:41.279 --> 54:43.846
<i>will prove,
without a shadow of doubt,</i>

54:43.848 --> 54:46.699
<i>the types of experiments</i>

54:46.700 --> 54:49.551
<i>the depraved Doctor Marshall
and his wife performed down here</i>

54:49.553 --> 54:53.055
<i>in the depths
of the military base.</i>

54:53.057 --> 54:55.591
<i>Although, I'm sure you're
probably asking yourselves,</i>

54:55.593 --> 54:59.561
<i>"What happened
to that sole alien survivor?"</i>

54:59.563 --> 55:02.598
<i>With not a shred
of physical proof</i>

55:02.600 --> 55:05.034
<i>suggesting the fact
that it even existed.</i>

55:06.671 --> 55:08.637
<i>Maybe it was simply
just destroyed</i>

55:08.639 --> 55:12.041
<i>in the explosion
that killed the doctor,</i>

55:12.043 --> 55:13.676
<i>and virtually,
every one of the soldiers</i>

55:13.678 --> 55:15.661
<i>housed at the barracks.</i>

55:15.662 --> 55:17.645
- Fucking psychopath.
<i>- Maybe it was. Yes.</i>

55:17.648 --> 55:20.449
<i>Just as, maybe,
on the afternoon</i>

55:20.451 --> 55:22.851
<i>of April 30th, 1946,</i>

55:22.853 --> 55:27.389
<i>Magda Goebbels convinced
Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun</i>

55:27.391 --> 55:30.559
<i>to fake their deaths and flee
to South America.</i>

55:31.696 --> 55:34.463
<i>At this point, it's up to you</i>

55:34.465 --> 55:37.433
<i>what to believe and what not to.</i>

55:38.669 --> 55:40.736
<i>Each to their own.</i>

55:55.720 --> 55:58.387
What the fuck
is all this shit, Joe?

55:58.389 --> 56:00.389
Sara.

56:00.391 --> 56:02.691
Sara, come on. Come on.
I think it's gone.

56:05.830 --> 56:08.831
What... Can anybody explain
any of this, Joe?

56:08.833 --> 56:10.099
How the hell
am I supposed to know

56:10.101 --> 56:11.800
what goes on down there, Sara?
Come on, Come on.

56:11.802 --> 56:13.068
- Hey, look, it's just... Hey.
- No, I can't.

56:13.070 --> 56:14.603
- Take my hand. Take my hand.
- No, I can't.

56:14.605 --> 56:16.772
- Hey. Yeah, you can. You can.
- No, I can't.

56:16.774 --> 56:18.574
It's gonna be okay. Yeah?

56:18.576 --> 56:19.908
It's gonna be okay.

56:21.045 --> 56:22.077
Come on.

56:23.647 --> 56:25.948
On three, we move.

56:25.950 --> 56:26.982
Okay?

56:33.758 --> 56:34.823
One.

56:36.727 --> 56:37.793
Two.

56:40.965 --> 56:42.865
Three. Go! Go!

56:42.867 --> 56:44.466
Run!

56:52.176 --> 56:54.910
Joe! What are you doing?

56:55.679 --> 56:57.112
I'm sorry, Sara.

56:57.114 --> 56:58.213
I'm sorry.

56:58.215 --> 56:59.982
You can't leave me here!

57:01.519 --> 57:03.185
I'll come back for you.

57:03.187 --> 57:05.020
I promise I'll come back.

57:05.022 --> 57:06.221
Whatever happens, just...

57:07.591 --> 57:08.991
just know I'm sorry.

57:14.565 --> 57:17.132
Ed? It's dead!
You hear me?

57:18.669 --> 57:20.185
- Joe!
- I'm gonna finish it

57:20.186 --> 57:21.702
- for good this time.
- Joe, are you okay?

58:25.903 --> 58:28.270
Oh, my god.
What have they done to you?

58:41.652 --> 58:43.218
What have they done to you?

58:46.690 --> 58:48.757
No. No.

58:48.759 --> 58:51.093
No! No! No!

58:52.162 --> 58:54.029
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

59:35.306 --> 59:37.306
Oh.

59:37.308 --> 59:39.374
Get out of the way,
you good-for-nothing half-wit.

59:40.978 --> 59:42.945
Oh, my pretty.

59:44.615 --> 59:45.948
Hold her for me, son.

59:51.088 --> 59:53.655
Oh, shut up, whore!

59:53.657 --> 59:54.723
You wet yourself?

59:56.393 --> 59:58.243
I'm sick and tired

59:58.244 --> 01:00:00.094
of these damned hysterical girls
you keep bringing in, Ed.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.597
Eh!

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:03.632
Eh, stop your squealing
like a little pig!

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:05.601
Now...

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:08.203
Looking good.

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:26.288
Goddamnit.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.890
Oh.

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:31.126
This is gonna boost
your fertility

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.327
and make a real woman
out of you.

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:36.765
Ed, that's... Ah!

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:40.636
You're gonna enjoy this.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:43.305
Just like I did
when I was about your age.

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:47.409
You can let her go now.

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:49.044
And let him know!

01:00:53.384 --> 01:00:55.417
Now, that's more like it.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:57.185
Teamwork and coordination.

01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:59.721
Your daddy would be proud.
Help me up.

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:01.189
That's it.

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:03.191
Now, uh...

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:05.827
You stay here
and watch over them.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:09.231
And don't you be
touching yourself.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:10.732
Then come and help me.

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:12.067
I'm gonna check
on the other two.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.766
Joe... Joe.

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:18.934
Joe!

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:20.268
Joe!

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:01.843
Thank you.

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:13.121
So...

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:15.290
You must be Sara.

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:20.862
Yeah... Yeah.

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:23.165
You're the...

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:26.902
That's right.

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:28.170
I'm Mrs. Marshall.

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:29.404
Ed's mom.

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:34.142
Anything I can help you
with there?

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:36.545
Uh...

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:40.282
Uh, mm...

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:41.817
Maybe, I... I...

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:45.887
Have you seen the ranger? Joe?

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:49.624
Well, um...

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:52.027
I don't, I don't know
how to explain this

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:53.128
to you, but, um...

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.097
We were outside,

01:03:57.134 --> 01:03:59.000
and... and a bear attacked us.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:03.338
Hm. There are no bears
in my garden, little lady.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.973
I would have thought you would
have been smart enough

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:06.408
to figure that one out by now.

01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:09.144
I...

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:11.112
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.916
Joe!

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:16.117
Joe!

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:37.572
Ah, fuck.

01:04:54.024 --> 01:04:55.457
What the fuck is...

01:04:58.095 --> 01:04:59.127
Huh...

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:10.438
This is coming along
very nicely, dear.

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:16.044
Oh, it's a little girl.

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:17.379
Just like its mama.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:20.548
What the fuck
are you doing to me?

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:25.053
Now, now, Sara.

01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:26.421
Don't be ungrateful.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:30.325
Honestly, didn't they teach you
any manners at school?

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:37.565
Let me go,
you fucking psychopath!

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:38.967
Motherfucker...

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:48.476
We have spent
the last three decades

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:52.013
trying to successfully breed
a hybrid female.

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:53.515
And at last,

01:05:53.517 --> 01:05:56.451
it looks like we found
the right formula.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:06:01.189
If only the doctor could be here
to witness it.

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:03.525
He'd be so proud
that we'll be bringing

01:06:03.527 --> 01:06:05.427
two little girls into the world.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.698
That's not happening.

01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:15.236
Crazy bitch.

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:19.507
Hope you burn in hell.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:22.610
Joe!

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:24.346
Joe!

01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:26.247
Sara, run.
Run and don't look back!

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.616
Where the hell are you?

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:30.185
Get out
of this hellhole, please.

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:32.087
Sorry, Sara. Please forgive me.

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:33.989
I'm not leaving
without you, Joe!

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:35.991
Sara, do not come in here.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.649
What the fuck is going on?

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:45.499
Completing what God started.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:50.038
Son of a bitch! You can speak.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.007
We can all speak here, sweetie.

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:21.669
I'm sorry, Sara.

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:26.641
You're a hybrid.

01:07:30.113 --> 01:07:32.113
Just like your daughter.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.290
We are family now, Sara.

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:43.591
Just accept it!

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:45.860
No!

01:07:57.274 --> 01:07:59.274
<i>If my findings are right,</i>

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:01.676
<i>Dr. Marshall had three sons.</i>

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:05.380
<i>Two of which we have seen
running around the lab as kids.</i>

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:07.315
<i>The chubby one</i>

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.249
<i>and the one with the mark
on his face.</i>

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.287
<i>While the identity
of the third child is...</i>

01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:13.855
<i>unknown,</i>

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:15.422
<i>it would seem safe to assume
that if--</i>

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.559
<i>Help! Help! Help!</i>

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.294
<i>Okay. All right.
All right. Okay.</i>

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:20.428
<i>All right. Are you okay...</i>

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.814
<i>All right. Calm down.</i>

01:08:22.814 --> 01:08:25.198
<i>Look. Look. You can go to my car
but I have to get to work.</i>

01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:26.367
<i>I gotta keep my camera...</i>

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.303
<i>Okay.</i>

01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:31.606
It's okay. I'll be right there.
All right.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.308
Okay.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:34.709
We'll get you somewhere...

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:36.411
...somewhere safe.

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:38.113
Some warm food.

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:56.865
Look, I told you
it's gonna be okay, okay?

01:08:56.867 --> 01:08:57.899
Yeah.

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:00.801
So, uh...

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:03.238
Did you see the first episode
of the documentary, then?

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.140
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:08.676
What did you make of it?

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:12.881
Great.

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:14.349
Yeah.

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:19.854
Good. 'Cause I've loved playing
with cameras ever since.

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:23.957
<i>Ever since I can remember.</i>

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:29.430
Any day now, I see.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:36.671
You think?

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.939
Yeah! Yeah!

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:42.176
Yeah, it's a...

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.511
It's amazing how fast they,
they grow nowadays.

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.182
Well, you'll find out.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.620
Oh, let me guess. Um...

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:55.924
He told you that
you had been abducted, right?

01:09:55.926 --> 01:09:57.992
By aliens, no?

01:09:59.396 --> 01:10:02.197
Yeah! Of course, he did!

01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:05.333
Yeah, 'cause, man, he's
one fucking nasty piece of work,

01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:06.401
that fucking guy.

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:07.602
He's a...

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:09.537
...a fucking goddamn hybrid!

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.407
Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:14.342
Now, with mother fucking helping

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:16.744
on... on...
on boosting fertility.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:18.246
Ooh!

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:21.216
He has his way with everything

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:24.752
and anything that wanders out
into our little, whoo...

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:26.588
neck of the woods.

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:31.392
I mean, just think about it.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:36.030
If we actually manage
to engender a, a female hybrid.

01:10:36.032 --> 01:10:37.599
Oh, god!

01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:40.235
I shudder to think what's next.

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:41.903
A new species, Mama says.

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.805
Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:45.740
"'Cause that was
your father's dream!

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:47.976
Yeah, that was
your father's dream."

01:10:47.978 --> 01:10:49.577
Yeah, but that's
the fucking problem, you see?

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.412
That's the fucking problem!

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.548
Everybody is so fucking
wrapped up

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:55.984
in their own
fucking dreams, right?

01:10:55.986 --> 01:10:57.819
And I'm telling you,
you have to be careful,

01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:59.587
you have to... you have to...

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:01.990
you need to be careful
with what you wish for.

01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:03.758
Because if it comes true,

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:05.525
and then you find out that it's
not what you actually wanted,

01:11:05.528 --> 01:11:06.861
and then, you're fucked.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:08.529
Then you're fucked.
That's it. It's over.

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:10.398
And then, then what? Huh?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.916
Then what? Then...

01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:13.433
There's no turning back.
That's it. That's it.

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:14.602
End of the story.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:18.373
I mean, fucking goddamn hybrid!

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:20.475
Can you, can you imagine that?

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:22.944
Oh, god. They'd be worse
than fucking humans, man.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:25.280
And the humans
are fucking bad enough as it is.

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:27.382
Don't you think?

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:28.950
Huh?

01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:32.287
I mean,

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:34.489
how can anybody,
in their right mind,

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:35.823
think that the fucking
extraterrestrials

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.325
even wanna fucking come back?

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.826
Do they really think
they're that fucking stupid?

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:40.928
Huh?

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:45.333
And what the fuck would they
be interested in discovering

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:48.436
out here in our little piece
of shit corner of the galaxy,

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:50.338
populated by nothing, but a...

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:51.973
worthless,

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:54.108
miserable,

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:55.376
selfish,

01:11:55.378 --> 01:11:57.578
fucking pathetic species?

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:03.718
Did you see what I'm saying?

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:07.989
Did you see what I'm saying?

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:10.058
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay.

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.492
You get it, don't you?

01:12:14.064 --> 01:12:16.898
"Thou shalt not steal.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.833
Thou shalt not...

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:22.437
bear false witness against
thy neighbor. Thou shalt not...

01:12:22.439 --> 01:12:24.572
covet thy neighbor's wife."

01:12:24.574 --> 01:12:28.076
Not their ass, their dwelling,
nor their ox.

01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:30.378
"Thou shalt not kill."
What is that?

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:31.579
"Thou shalt..."

01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:32.914
"Thou shalt not kill."

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.916
What the fuck?

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:38.720
Yeah. Oh, god.

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:41.055
Yeah. You must have been out
to fucking lunch

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:43.891
the day you left your fucking
underlings in charge,

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.693
to come up with us.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.595
To create us fucking
human beings.

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:49.397
And they used all
the fucking shit

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:50.965
that they could find
around up there.

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:52.533
And it's fucking in us.

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:54.135
It's fucking in us.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.975
Oh, god. Ah, fucking humans.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:03.544
Oh, they are the fucking worst.

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:04.846
The fucking worst.

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.716
Okay.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.186
All of it, it's just...

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:13.821
a matter of time now.

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:19.460
Oh, just a silly
little fucking waiting game.

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:26.968
I'm sorry I didn't...

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:29.537
I didn't mean to yell.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:34.742
It's okay.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.544
We're the good ones, okay?

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:38.079
All right?

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:40.047
It's gonna be okay.

01:13:41.151 --> 01:13:42.617
We're gonna get you home.

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:43.751
Okay?

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:45.520
All right? So, don't worry.

01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:47.789
All right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:49.123
All right. Yeah.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.236
Hey, be more careful! Jesus...

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:05.840
Christ!

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:15.116
No trace of Sam, sir.

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.652
Then he's probably taking her
back to his lair.

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:20.188
Help!

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:22.623
Help!

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:30.865
What the fuck?

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:39.907
Hey, calm down. Calm down.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:41.509
Hey.

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:43.244
All right.
What's eating you, little lady?

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:44.712
Those fucking bears?

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:45.913
No. Please.

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:48.049
- Please. Please.
- Don't worry. You're safe.

01:14:48.051 --> 01:14:49.250
Look at me.

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:50.718
You're safe now.

01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:54.722
Put her in the car.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:56.624
And you give her something
to calm her down.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.259
Now.

01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:05.766
What the hell is going on here?

01:15:05.768 --> 01:15:08.169
You still not finished
with that documentary, or what?

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:10.271
Yeah.

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:12.740
Uh, no. I'm working on a sequel,
so, um...

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:14.942
I guess, no. Um...

01:15:14.944 --> 01:15:17.879
But, I, I don't know
what happened, Inspector.

01:15:17.881 --> 01:15:19.614
I... I saw her over
on the other side,

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.849
and, you know, she was running
away from the barracks.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.751
So what the hell happened
to her?

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:26.554
I don't know. I think
she's a little crazy, Inspector.

01:15:26.556 --> 01:15:28.055
She was going on and on

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:29.557
about... about an abduction

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:31.559
and a woman
in a white nurse's uniform.

01:15:31.561 --> 01:15:33.094
She's too Cuckoo.

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:34.662
Did you not see Joe up there?

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:39.033
Speaking of the devil,
there he is!

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.935
Can you wait for me
in the car, asswipe?

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:44.589
Yeah, well, I can't wait to hear

01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:45.940
what kinda cockamamie
bullshit stories--

01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:47.542
Get the fuck out of here!

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.653
- I'm really sorry.
- You're sorry?

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:02.757
What the fuck
happened here, Joe?

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.560
I mean, can somebody,
please, tell me

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:06.994
what the hell is going on?

01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:10.164
I've got an agent
mauled to death.

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.900
Oh, and then some girl turns up,

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:15.369
making absolutely no sense,
whatsoever.

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:18.573
And going on
about some abduction.

01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:20.741
It didn't occur to you
to call me?

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.377
Am I the only sane one
on this fucking planet, or what?

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:25.112
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Yeah. You already said that.

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:27.982
The guy's just got
a little too...

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:30.318
Oh, Jesus.

01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:36.123
Well, it looks like you got
your work cut out for you.

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:37.358
You'd better get on with it.

01:16:38.628 --> 01:16:40.027
Yeah. I best had.

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:43.931
You'll have to excuse me.

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:51.238
Come find me
whenever you want.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.608
<i>Mi casa su casa and all that.</i>

01:16:54.877 --> 01:16:55.977
Asshole!

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:06.387
