00:20.433 --> 00:21.640
You know, it'd be cool

00:21.705 --> 00:23.622
if these menus wiped us
for a change.

00:23.730 --> 00:25.251
Yeah,
like we're so clean.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.321
Hey, Teddy.
We haven't seen you in a while.

00:27.386 --> 00:29.071
I've been working,
like, three days straight

00:29.136 --> 00:30.657
for Helen,
out at her beach house.

00:30.722 --> 00:32.789
Oh, that house.
I want that house.

00:32.854 --> 00:33.938
I want it first.

00:34.003 --> 00:35.985
It's been nice,
just me and Helen

00:36.050 --> 00:38.930
working, talking.
We've even shared a few sunsets.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.311
I'm pretty sure
one of the days,

00:40.376 --> 00:42.397
we both looked
at the sunset at the same time.

00:42.462 --> 00:44.865
It sounds like you still have
a little crush on her, Teddy.

00:44.930 --> 00:46.600
A crush?
Oh, I don't know.

00:46.665 --> 00:48.557
Maybe.
I mean, she's so, uh...

00:48.641 --> 00:49.951
- Helen...
- Ah...

00:50.016 --> 00:51.998
Are there any dances coming up
you could ask her to?

00:52.063 --> 00:53.779
Yeah, when is Handyman Prom?

00:53.844 --> 00:55.555
What?
No, a guy like me

00:55.622 --> 00:57.748
doesn't have a chance
with a lady like her.

00:57.813 --> 01:00.303
Oh, come on.
Sure, she's gorgeous and rich,

01:00.368 --> 01:01.756
and why would she go out
with you?

01:01.821 --> 01:03.951
But also why not you,
right?

01:04.016 --> 01:06.487
- Why can't you be Cinderella?
- Teddy-rella.

01:06.552 --> 01:08.670
- Nah, nah, nah.
- So what kind of work

01:08.735 --> 01:10.178
is she having you do
at her beach house?

01:10.243 --> 01:12.307
Mostly looking in chimneys
and air ducts.

01:12.372 --> 01:14.948
- Is that a euphemism?
- Why is she having you do that?

01:15.013 --> 01:16.944
Eh, Helen thinks
her late husband Larry,

01:17.009 --> 01:19.914
who she definitely didn't kill,
hid something valuable from her.

01:20.188 --> 01:22.217
D-Does she know
you describe her that way?

01:22.282 --> 01:24.678
Wait, Larry was
hiding stuff? Why?

01:24.743 --> 01:27.315
I don't know, but apparently
Larry liked to hide stuff

01:27.387 --> 01:29.522
- in vents and chimneys.
- 'Cause that's what you do

01:29.589 --> 01:31.951
when you totally trust your wife
who definitely didn't kill you.

01:32.016 --> 01:34.121
- Right, right.
- What did Helen think Larry hid?

01:34.186 --> 01:37.284
A little Japanese carved
figurine. It's called a netsuke.

01:37.399 --> 01:39.232
- Netsuke?
- Yeah, netsuke.

01:39.297 --> 01:41.356
I believe it's pronounced
"Netscape."

01:41.421 --> 01:43.891
This one's a carving
of two snails intertwined.

01:43.989 --> 01:47.018
- On their honeymoon, maybe?
- Wow. That's beautiful.

01:47.110 --> 01:49.779
I wouldn't say beautiful,
but it seems consensual?

01:49.844 --> 01:51.006
I guess it's worth a ton.

01:51.071 --> 01:53.522
Apparently, Larry had all sorts
of wacky investments.

01:53.587 --> 01:57.420
Japanese antiquities, vintage
typewriters, real estate.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.887
W-W-Wait, why is real estate
a wacky investment?

01:59.976 --> 02:01.803
Well, if you saw the apartment
building he owned.

02:01.868 --> 02:04.389
You know that place, a couple
blocks from here, the DuMont?

02:04.454 --> 02:06.584
Oh, yeah. Near the stop sign
with the testicles

02:06.649 --> 02:08.068
- graffitied on it.
- That's the one.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.654
I've done some
handyman stuff there.

02:09.721 --> 02:11.248
It's an interesting old place.

02:11.313 --> 02:13.475
Nothing works in the whole
building, but it's got charm.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.673
Hold on. I wonder
if Larry hid the netsuke

02:15.738 --> 02:17.607
- at his apartment building.
- Huh.

02:17.672 --> 02:20.826
Teddy, you got to go
there and find the Netflixy.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.415
- Netsuke.
- Yeah, so you can surprise Helen with it.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.551
Whoa, you'd score huge points
with her if you did that.

02:25.616 --> 02:27.416
- I would?
- Are you kidding me?

02:27.481 --> 02:30.217
You'd be her Prince Charming.
It's a friggin' fairy tale.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.777
Wait, I thought he was
Cinderella. Now he's a prince?

02:32.844 --> 02:34.494
He can be both, Bob.

02:34.594 --> 02:36.147
Yeah, Dad, read a book.

02:36.214 --> 02:37.881
Huh. I do still have keys.

02:37.946 --> 02:40.678
Let's all go right now.
We can help you find it.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.687
Yes, let's do it for love.

02:42.754 --> 02:45.849
And for Louise to get a super
valuable snail sculpture.

02:45.955 --> 02:48.542
No, Louise, it's not yours,
even if you find it.

02:48.691 --> 02:49.853
Come on.

02:49.918 --> 02:52.958
Let's all help Teddy find the
thing and get his dream girl.

02:53.035 --> 02:55.056
Yeah, great.
Let's close a little early

02:55.121 --> 02:57.336
and go probably not find
something somewhere.

02:57.403 --> 02:58.707
All right.

02:59.129 --> 03:00.172
Wow.

03:00.237 --> 03:01.931
This place is older than Dad.

03:01.996 --> 03:04.001
- No offense, Dad.
- None taken.

03:04.066 --> 03:06.505
- A lot of buildings are.
- Not in this country.

03:06.582 --> 03:09.373
Okay, so every apartment
has vents and fireplaces.

03:09.441 --> 03:10.880
And we're gonna check 'em all.

03:10.956 --> 03:13.529
Come on, Teddy's magical future
life with Helen depends on us.

03:13.621 --> 03:15.556
And why are people gonna
just let us in?

03:15.623 --> 03:18.740
We'll tell 'em, uh, we're here
to do maintenance stuff.

03:18.808 --> 03:20.937
- You know, we'll fib a little.
- Oh, boy.

03:21.004 --> 03:23.531
"Open up, tenant,
we need to search your holes."

03:23.598 --> 03:25.470
There you go. Gene gets it.

03:25.535 --> 03:27.751
So we should probably split up.
There's three floors.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.400
Bob, Gene,
you guys start at the top.

03:29.465 --> 03:31.260
- We'll meet you in the middle.
- And we'll all kiss.

03:31.325 --> 03:32.962
Fine.

03:33.027 --> 03:34.368
- Not now.
- Okay.

03:34.433 --> 03:36.157
Uh, d-don't bother
with the elevator.

03:36.222 --> 03:37.931
It hasn't worked
in 30 years, apparently.

03:37.996 --> 03:40.454
It's basically just
a big fancy birdcage now.

03:40.519 --> 03:42.248
So, stairs, then?
Perfect.

03:42.313 --> 03:44.615
Anyone want to trade,
third floor?

03:45.285 --> 03:46.861
Hello? Who's there?

03:46.926 --> 03:49.904
Hi, my son and I are here
with Teddy the handyman.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.478
We're here
to check some pipes.

03:51.543 --> 03:53.111
Uh, great. Come in, come in.

03:53.176 --> 03:55.306
I-I called about the pipes
a few weeks ago.

03:55.371 --> 03:57.790
The hot water in the kitchen
just trickles out.

03:57.855 --> 03:59.329
- TMI.
- Follow me.

03:59.394 --> 04:00.884
Can I get you something
to drink?

04:00.949 --> 04:04.111
Maybe some warm water from
the sink, if you have an hour?

04:04.176 --> 04:06.595
Ha. Uh, no.
We're-we're good, thanks.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.196
Why are we looking at his pipes?

04:08.261 --> 04:10.114
Oh, crap. Did I say "pipes"?

04:10.278 --> 04:11.600
We were supposed to say "vents."

04:11.665 --> 04:13.806
Or was it "vests"?
Want to check him for vests?

04:13.871 --> 04:16.603
- You guys see a cat in here?
- Um, no, no...

04:16.668 --> 04:18.091
If you do, it's not mine.

04:18.156 --> 04:19.587
- Let it out.
- Okay.

04:19.652 --> 04:22.445
- Should we just leave?
- No, we should help this guy.

04:22.510 --> 04:23.948
I think he's blind.

04:24.026 --> 04:25.290
Let's look at his pipes

04:25.355 --> 04:27.642
and then maybe we can
casually switch to vents.

04:27.707 --> 04:29.759
- Then vests.
- Here's where it's trickling.

04:29.824 --> 04:31.165
Sorry it's dark in here,

04:31.230 --> 04:33.314
but you probably have
your own work light, right?

04:33.379 --> 04:35.131
Uh, uh, we, uh...

04:35.196 --> 04:36.282
We don't...
We don't have it on us.

04:36.347 --> 04:38.954
It's in the truck.
Our big butch truck for boys.

04:39.019 --> 04:40.816
- We both drive.
- Gene, stop talking.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.345
Who'd you say
you were, again?

04:42.410 --> 04:44.111
- Oh, uh...
- Fleetwood Mac!

04:44.176 --> 04:45.807
No, we're not,
we're not Fleet...

04:45.874 --> 04:47.087
- We are Fleetwood Mac.
- We're... our...

04:47.152 --> 04:49.075
The name of our company
is Fleetwood Mac.

04:49.140 --> 04:50.096
We're handymen.

04:50.161 --> 04:51.416
- Are you?
- H-Handy?

04:51.481 --> 04:52.845
- Yes.
- We're handsy.

04:52.910 --> 04:54.113
- Gene.
- Uh, well,

04:54.178 --> 04:55.669
I'm gonna go back
to my shows.

04:55.770 --> 04:58.048
Great. Well, we'll be in here.

04:58.113 --> 04:59.196
With our plumber butts.

04:59.261 --> 05:01.775
Fix, fix, fix, fix, fix, fix.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.105
Hi.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.736
Uh, we would like to check out
your heating vents.

05:05.801 --> 05:07.165
All, all of you?

05:07.230 --> 05:09.532
- That's right.
- Doesn't make a lot of sense.

05:09.597 --> 05:10.995
- No, no, it does.
- Oh, it does?

05:11.060 --> 05:12.315
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It makes perfect sense.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.368
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:13.433 --> 05:15.124
Oh, okay. Sure, why not?

05:15.225 --> 05:16.694
- Come in.
- Great, thanks.

05:16.759 --> 05:18.190
Oh, I know you.

05:18.255 --> 05:19.978
Yeah, I, I-I swapped out

05:20.043 --> 05:21.603
your refrigerator
a couple of months ago.

05:21.668 --> 05:23.126
Of course!
Yeah, how's your back?

05:23.191 --> 05:25.537
Uh, I thought it was gonna snap
like a wishbone.

05:25.888 --> 05:27.186
My wish would have been

05:27.251 --> 05:29.470
that I didn't have
a herniated disc.

05:29.535 --> 05:30.337
Eh...

05:30.402 --> 05:32.059
Would you rather have
a his-niated disc?

05:32.124 --> 05:33.962
His-niated.

05:34.027 --> 05:34.853
- Ah.
- Right.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.685
Yeah. I'm Kathleen,
by the way.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.204
Uh, me, too.
Yeah.

05:38.269 --> 05:39.873
Uh, no. I mean, no.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.812
You're Kathleen. I'm Teddy.

05:41.877 --> 05:43.553
Whoa. Chemistry alert.

05:43.618 --> 05:45.113
Uh, what sport
are you watching here?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.861
Wha-What is this,
grass hockey or something?

05:46.926 --> 05:48.727
- People polo?
- People polo?

05:48.898 --> 05:50.517
- No, it's hurling.
- Hurling? What...?

05:50.582 --> 05:51.775
What-What's hurling?

05:51.840 --> 05:54.267
Well, it's-it's like
if hockey, soccer, and baseball

05:54.332 --> 05:55.884
had a baby, and then
that baby joined a gang...

05:55.949 --> 05:57.962
Hey, Mom, Louise,
quick hallway meeting?

05:58.027 --> 06:00.025
Did you guys see Teddy
and Kathleen in there?

06:00.090 --> 06:02.585
- They're really hitting it off.
- No. Tina, what?

06:02.660 --> 06:04.466
- We're here for Teddy and Helen.
- And the Netsuke.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.829
Just saying, we're-we're here
to help Teddy find love,

06:06.894 --> 06:08.900
but what if it's not
with Helen?

06:08.965 --> 06:11.385
Listen, when rich
and beautiful Helen sees Teddy

06:11.450 --> 06:12.923
marching in there
with that nutsky...

06:12.988 --> 06:14.745
- Netsuke.
- She is going to pick him up

06:14.810 --> 06:17.189
and carry him away, and they're
gonna live happily ever after

06:17.254 --> 06:19.212
- in her beach house castle.
- 'Cause she's rich.

06:19.277 --> 06:21.669
Well, maybe Teddy doesn't need
a rich Princess Charming

06:21.760 --> 06:22.962
to pick him up
and carry him away.

06:23.027 --> 06:24.165
Maybe he needs a nice lady

06:24.230 --> 06:25.711
with either
a charming speech impediment

06:25.776 --> 06:27.126
or a cool accent...
I can't tell...

06:27.191 --> 06:29.309
In a sensible apartment
to watch weird sports with.

06:29.374 --> 06:31.064
Sorry, Mom.
I'm on Team Kathleen.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.603
Well, I'm on Team Helen.

06:32.668 --> 06:35.560
Remember, we're here to make
Teddy and Helen a reality.

06:35.887 --> 06:37.900
Pfft. Well, I'm here to make
Teddy and Kathleen a reality.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.743
Helen and Teddy are gonna
toast me at their wedding,

06:40.808 --> 06:43.165
and you are gonna have
to clap and smile nice.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.837
Well, I'll try
and get you an invitation

06:44.902 --> 06:46.829
to Kathleen and Teddy's wedding,
but no promises.

06:46.894 --> 06:49.001
And it's probably going
to be a destination wedding

06:49.066 --> 06:52.251
- in wherever Kathleen's from.
- I want to say Pennsylvania?

06:52.918 --> 06:55.058
Too bad Kathleen's bonding up
a storm with Teddy,

06:55.123 --> 06:57.169
and Helen's not
even here...

06:57.512 --> 07:00.150
- Damn.
- There she is. -Um, hi.

07:00.215 --> 07:02.251
Oh, she's even better looking than
I remember.

07:02.316 --> 07:03.535
Oh, boy.

07:06.004 --> 07:08.486
- What's going on?
- Helen, hey.

07:08.551 --> 07:10.470
What-what-what...
what are you doing here?

07:10.535 --> 07:13.056
- How about you first?
- I was looking for that, uh,

07:13.121 --> 07:16.729
uh, thing of Larry's, and
these Belchers were helping me.

07:16.794 --> 07:18.723
Well, that's fun
that you shared that information

07:18.788 --> 07:19.985
with so many people.

07:20.050 --> 07:22.406
This thing has a lot
of sentimental value for me.

07:22.471 --> 07:23.852
Maybe actual value.
Who knows?

07:23.917 --> 07:26.407
You know, this feels
like a reward situation,

07:26.472 --> 07:28.071
since this thing has so much

07:28.136 --> 07:29.953
- sentimental value, right?
- I mean... right?

07:30.018 --> 07:32.027
Yes, yes,
of course let's have a reward.

07:32.092 --> 07:33.363
How does $20 sound?

07:33.428 --> 07:35.589
Oh... like not enough money.
$50.

07:35.654 --> 07:38.109
Well, aren't you
a little businesswoman?

07:38.205 --> 07:40.196
- Okay, deal.
- Thousand. $50,000.

07:40.261 --> 07:43.095
- Louise. Shushies.
- Oh, you're Larry's widow.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.837
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Losing a husband really sucks.

07:45.902 --> 07:47.470
I know, I l...
I lost one, myself.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.775
Yeah, it's rough.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.236
It's really, really rough stuff.

07:50.301 --> 07:51.923
- Who's this?
- That's Kathleen.

07:51.988 --> 07:52.946
She lives in 1-A.

07:53.011 --> 07:55.986
Larry was a nice guy
and a delight of a neighbor.

07:56.051 --> 07:57.743
What do you mean,
neighbor?

07:57.808 --> 08:00.446
Neigh-bor. Am I saying that
right? Neigh-bor?

08:00.511 --> 08:03.064
He stayed here when he was
in town? In his apartment? 3-B?

08:03.129 --> 08:06.724
Uh, I mean, of course I know
he had an apartment here. Duh.

08:06.839 --> 08:08.904
Yeah, you were...
you were saying it weird.

08:08.987 --> 08:11.204
That son of a bitch had
a secret man cave.

08:11.269 --> 08:13.739
- Did-did it work now?
- No.

08:13.823 --> 08:14.919
- Now?
- No.

08:14.990 --> 08:17.092
So, keep doing this
a hundred more times?

08:17.229 --> 08:19.110
Well, turning this thing
is the full extent

08:19.175 --> 08:21.552
of my plumbing knowledge.
Wait. Did it work now?

08:21.661 --> 08:23.024
- No.
- Now?

08:23.089 --> 08:24.501
- Hell no.
- Why hell no?

08:24.566 --> 08:25.731
Just switching it up.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.446
Old baseball mitts,
vintage board games.

08:28.511 --> 08:29.627
It's like he filled this place

08:29.692 --> 08:31.157
with everything
I wouldn't let him have at home.

08:31.222 --> 08:33.298
So, Kathleen, I love your hair.
Tell me.

08:33.363 --> 08:35.126
How long ago
did your husband pass away?

08:35.191 --> 08:37.214
Appropriate time
to start dating again ago?

08:37.279 --> 08:38.462
Smooth, T. Perfect.

08:38.527 --> 08:41.063
Eight years ago.
He was hit by a train.

08:41.183 --> 08:43.020
Oh. I'm so sorry.
That's terrible.

08:43.214 --> 08:45.251
Oh. Did you sue the city
for millions?

08:45.316 --> 08:46.595
Oh, you Americans.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.360
Suing for millions isn't
gonna bring him back.

08:48.425 --> 08:49.814
Plus, you know,
he loved trains.

08:49.879 --> 08:52.224
- Uh, who doesn't?
- Booze cart? What?

08:52.348 --> 08:54.360
Teddy, come here.
Help me fix Helen a drink.

08:54.425 --> 08:56.120
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Okay.

08:56.346 --> 08:57.544
Well, good luck

08:57.629 --> 08:58.618
- finding what you're looking for.
- Uh,

08:58.683 --> 09:00.595
- where are you going?
- Back to my apartment.

09:00.660 --> 09:02.227
- It's where I keep my telly.
- But wait!

09:02.292 --> 09:04.142
Don't you want to stay and talk
with Teddy? Oh, she's gone.

09:04.207 --> 09:06.138
Helen, look at Teddy
pour these drinks.

09:06.203 --> 09:08.185
He's like friggin' Tom Cruise
in Cocktail.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.728
Yeah, I went
to bartending school.

09:09.793 --> 09:11.088
Best four years of my life.

09:11.153 --> 09:13.289
- Ooh, make me a mai tai!
- A what?

09:13.354 --> 09:15.003
Helen, do you mind
if I smash this vase?

09:15.068 --> 09:16.423
Oh, please do.
I hate that vase.

09:16.488 --> 09:18.267
- Yes.
- Louise, no.

09:18.332 --> 09:19.720
Damn it.
Where are you going?

09:19.785 --> 09:21.916
After Kathleen.
I've got a match to make.

09:21.981 --> 09:24.166
I'll join you.
Maybe Larry's secret apartment

09:24.231 --> 09:26.236
is too obvious a place
to hide a secret.

09:26.301 --> 09:28.955
- Oh, hey, guys. How's it going?
- It's going weird. You?

09:29.020 --> 09:31.154
Same.
Dad, are you lost?

09:31.243 --> 09:33.566
Um, no.
We're helping this guy in 3-A.

09:33.631 --> 09:35.814
I just can't figure out
where this pipe goes to.

09:35.879 --> 09:38.330
If these two go to the radiator,
what is this one?

09:38.395 --> 09:40.822
- Maybe it goes to your butt?
- Yeah, Dad. Check it.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.525
- Oh, hey... guys.
- What you eating?

09:44.590 --> 09:46.740
- Cold pasta.
- Hot damn.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.232
Do... you want some?

09:49.535 --> 09:51.403
Mmm. Mmm, mmm.

09:51.533 --> 09:53.062
This is cold pasta, all right.

09:53.127 --> 09:54.976
I'm gonna look
around your apartment,

09:55.041 --> 09:57.330
but it'll be totally normal.
Ignore me.

09:57.395 --> 09:58.825
Okay...?

09:58.910 --> 10:02.966
Speaking of cold pasta...
what do you... look for in a fella?

10:03.144 --> 10:05.345
Uh, I suppose
I-I like guys that are kind...

10:05.410 --> 10:06.764
- Check.
- And strong.

10:06.844 --> 10:09.728
Super check. Hey, Teddy,
we need you down in 1-A, buddy!

10:09.793 --> 10:11.917
And brilliant! I wouldn't kick
brilliant out of bed

10:11.982 --> 10:14.006
- for fartin' up the sheets.
- Brilliant. Uh-huh.

10:14.162 --> 10:15.744
Um, still come on down,
Teddy!

10:15.809 --> 10:16.850
There in a sec!

10:16.953 --> 10:19.533
And, uh,
you know who's never had an STD?

10:19.598 --> 10:21.080
Teddy... pretty sure.

10:21.145 --> 10:22.541
Hmm. Not really listening,
but great.

10:22.606 --> 10:24.303
- He was in the Navy, but, uh...
- Uh-huh.

10:24.393 --> 10:25.791
Sounds like they need me in 1-A.

10:25.856 --> 10:27.408
I'm just gonna pop down there
real quick.

10:27.473 --> 10:29.888
Hurry back! You got to be
the one to find the neti-potski!

10:29.953 --> 10:31.253
Right, right, right.

10:31.318 --> 10:33.759
Teddy, wait! We-We've got
a plumbing thing in here.

10:33.824 --> 10:35.633
How do you, um, do plumbing?

10:35.746 --> 10:37.598
Wish I had time, guys,
but, uh...

10:37.663 --> 10:41.142
here's a pliers, a wrench,
and a screwdriver. Godspeed.

10:41.326 --> 10:43.894
So, these guys'll just know
what to do, right?

10:43.993 --> 10:45.975
The wrench will. The screwdriver
doesn't know anything.

10:46.053 --> 10:47.799
And don't ask the pliers!

10:48.487 --> 10:50.081
Hi. You rang?

10:50.146 --> 10:52.535
Yes, but first, you've got
something in your eye.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.667
- I do?
- Oops, uh, where'd my glasses go?

10:55.732 --> 10:58.414
Kathleen, can you take a really
long look at Teddy's eyes?

10:58.479 --> 10:59.596
Okay.

10:59.881 --> 11:02.243
Hmm, they're kind of bloodshot.
What am I looking for?

11:02.310 --> 11:04.020
I have been welding
without a mask.

11:04.087 --> 11:06.237
Teddy, look into
Kathleen's eyes, deeply.

11:06.303 --> 11:08.490
Wait, who's got something
in their eye?

11:08.555 --> 11:09.975
I'm seeing eye boogies.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.748
You want me to get 'em out
or are we leaving them in?

11:11.813 --> 11:13.223
- What are we doing?
- Let's leave 'em in.

11:13.288 --> 11:16.145
Well, it's not in the fireplace.
Who's got a wet wipe?

11:16.210 --> 11:17.340
Teddy?

11:17.405 --> 11:19.199
Can you come upstairs
to 2-B?

11:19.294 --> 11:21.270
- Damn it.
- Okay, coming!

11:21.337 --> 11:24.640
2-B? Uh, 2-B continued.
Am I right, Kathleen?

11:24.707 --> 11:27.001
Not necessarily.
People could leave my apartment.

11:27.068 --> 11:28.147
That's an option.

11:28.212 --> 11:31.168
Uh, okay, I should
label these, probably.

11:31.559 --> 11:32.757
Oh, it's one of these.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.420
Okay. No. Ah, ah!
No. Ah! Not that one.

11:35.485 --> 11:38.107
Ah! It's not that one, either.
Here we go.

11:38.172 --> 11:39.734
- Okay.
- Not that time!

11:40.157 --> 11:42.547
Come on! There we go.
Open sesame.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.651
Here we are.
Apartment 2-B.

11:44.766 --> 11:46.592
Currently empty.
Nope.

11:46.657 --> 11:48.752
Hello, sir. You look terrified.

11:49.024 --> 11:52.134
Boy, Teddy the handyman.
Such a handy man.

11:52.201 --> 11:54.303
Imagine having someone
around all the time

11:54.370 --> 11:55.787
that could fix stuff
for you.

11:55.852 --> 11:57.208
Yeah. Especially around here,

11:57.273 --> 11:58.969
where everything breaks
or leaks or smells.

11:59.034 --> 12:01.701
And no one licensed has ever
stepped foot in this building.

12:01.766 --> 12:03.982
Hell, even Larry would pick up
a hammer sometimes.

12:04.047 --> 12:06.240
Try and nail down the
loose boards in the stairway.

12:06.305 --> 12:08.084
And he did some plumbing
in the upstairs hallway,

12:08.149 --> 12:09.022
for some reason.

12:09.087 --> 12:12.754
Plumbing in the upstairs
hallway, you don't say.

12:12.821 --> 12:14.282
- Well, I did say.
- You did.

12:14.349 --> 12:16.647
- Yeah, I just said it.
- Uh, excuse us.

12:16.712 --> 12:19.480
Tina girl, the pipes,
the pipes are calling.

12:19.687 --> 12:22.045
- What?
- Pipes? Pipes are calling?

12:22.110 --> 12:24.014
- You know, the song?
- "Danny Boy."

12:24.079 --> 12:25.428
- Yeah, yeah, it's good.
- Yeah. It's "the pipes are calling."

12:25.493 --> 12:26.540
- It's good.
- It's the...

12:26.605 --> 12:27.915
Ugh, you know what,
it-it doesn't...

12:27.980 --> 12:30.205
You don't even need to know
the song, just come with me.

12:30.277 --> 12:32.471
Dad said he couldn't figure out
where this pipe went.

12:32.671 --> 12:35.553
What if it doesn't go anywhere?

12:38.505 --> 12:40.388
Holy crap, you found it.

12:40.456 --> 12:42.680
Come on, let's collect
our dough and go.

12:42.745 --> 12:43.876
Right, we tell Helen,

12:43.941 --> 12:45.899
we get a reward,
and then we leave,

12:45.964 --> 12:48.227
and we'll never know if Kathleen
and Teddy were meant to be.

12:48.292 --> 12:49.850
Yup. Good plan. Let's do that.

12:49.917 --> 12:53.532
Unless we don't because
we never found the netsuke.

12:53.597 --> 12:55.126
What Kathleen and Teddy
need is more time

12:55.191 --> 12:56.384
for their romance to blossom.

12:56.449 --> 12:58.094
Come on, let's get this guy
back in its pipe.

12:58.159 --> 13:00.220
Whoa, but what about the reward?

13:00.285 --> 13:02.485
We'll "find" it again
in a little bit,

13:02.550 --> 13:04.688
after Teddy and Kathleen
realize they're falling in love.

13:04.753 --> 13:06.108
Then you'll get your reward.

13:06.175 --> 13:08.648
And you'll do my restaurant
chores for a month. Deal?

13:08.713 --> 13:11.262
Fine, whatever. Who's the
super-matchmaker now, huh?

13:11.368 --> 13:13.832
- Um, you are?
- Damn friggin' right I am.

13:17.636 --> 13:19.641
Okay, treasure re-hidden,
good, good.

13:19.706 --> 13:21.995
Now let's get back to forcing
Kathleen and Teddy together.

13:22.182 --> 13:24.659
The beginning
of every great love story.

13:25.737 --> 13:27.555
Crap. Teddy's with Helen.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.246
It's coming
from the laundry room.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.656
What's going on in here?

13:30.721 --> 13:34.164
Nothing. We're just venting.

13:34.229 --> 13:35.758
I've been waiting
a long time to say that.

13:35.823 --> 13:37.297
Totally worth it.

13:37.362 --> 13:38.625
Okay, we can laugh and look.

13:38.690 --> 13:40.297
Huh, candles.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.922
I might've lit a couple.
Maybe it's romantic, who knows?

13:43.987 --> 13:46.184
Ugh! Come on, Louise.

13:46.620 --> 13:49.422
Okay, this might work.
We, uh, we loosened it

13:49.487 --> 13:52.773
and, uh, then we tightened it.
I feel pretty good about this.

13:52.838 --> 13:55.133
Okay, does it work now?

13:55.198 --> 13:56.508
- No.
- Oh, crap.

13:56.573 --> 13:58.023
Just lie to me
at this point.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.286
- Really?
- No.

13:59.351 --> 14:00.805
Happy to lie to you
about your hair.

14:00.870 --> 14:02.693
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.047
Wait, does it work now?

14:04.112 --> 14:05.242
- Yes!
- Really?

14:05.307 --> 14:08.039
- Yes! What did you do?
- I turned the thing!

14:08.104 --> 14:09.691
I thought that's what
you were doing before.

14:09.756 --> 14:12.445
Uh, I was turning it wrong,
but let's not focus on that.

14:12.510 --> 14:13.508
We fixed the sink!

14:13.573 --> 14:15.155
We fixed the sink!
Come up to me.

14:15.220 --> 14:16.703
I need to hold you.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.354
I'm coming!

14:18.549 --> 14:19.987
This might take a minute.

14:20.065 --> 14:21.963
Here, let me pull on your ear.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.041
Ow! Don't pull!

14:23.119 --> 14:25.215
Let me look at your
little beautiful face!

14:25.280 --> 14:27.340
- I'm out! We did it!
- Oh, we did it!

14:27.405 --> 14:29.044
- We did it!
- You two sure are happy

14:29.109 --> 14:30.543
about doing your job.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.301
- Oh, uh, yeah, well, we, uh...
- I'm kidding.

14:33.366 --> 14:35.263
You're my new favorite handymen.

14:35.328 --> 14:38.734
I'm gonna recommend
Fleetwood Mac to all my friends.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.265
Is that sound
what I think it is?

14:41.350 --> 14:43.030
No. No, definitely not.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.989
Eh, come in, I guess?

14:47.054 --> 14:48.437
Hey, Kathleen,
I had such a hankering

14:48.502 --> 14:49.559
for more of that cold pasta.

14:49.624 --> 14:51.005
Mind if I help myself?
Cool, thanks.

14:51.070 --> 14:52.676
She couldn't stop talking
about it.

14:52.741 --> 14:54.510
Yeah, the secret's letting it
sit in the fridge

14:54.575 --> 14:55.512
for a couple of weeks.

14:55.577 --> 14:58.231
Oh, man! I-I got red sauce
all over this dish towel.

14:58.296 --> 15:00.450
- You clumsy fool.
- Ooh.

15:00.515 --> 15:01.872
Wait. Wha-What's-what's
happening?

15:01.937 --> 15:03.544
- Are you... are you people okay?
- Kathleen,

15:03.609 --> 15:05.434
you got to get this towel
to the laundry room right now.

15:05.499 --> 15:07.419
Come with us? Show us where
it is? Fix your hair?

15:07.484 --> 15:09.059
No, never mind. Th-There's
no time, you look great.

15:09.124 --> 15:10.092
- Move it.
- Coming through.

15:10.157 --> 15:12.590
- Now you're just pushing.
- Hey, girls.

15:12.674 --> 15:14.961
Bit of an emergency here.
Teddy, I need you and Kathleen

15:15.026 --> 15:16.316
to stand shoulder to shoulder...

15:16.381 --> 15:17.281
It's okay
if your shoulders touch...

15:17.346 --> 15:18.627
And rub stain remover
on this towel.

15:18.692 --> 15:19.756
- Hurry.
- Okay.

15:19.821 --> 15:21.126
It-It's a little cramped
in here,

15:21.191 --> 15:22.726
so, Helen and Mom,
can you guys leave?

15:22.791 --> 15:24.305
- No.
- How about we don't worry

15:24.370 --> 15:25.555
about a towel
right now?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.297
Yeah, I don't even wash
that towel ever.

15:27.362 --> 15:28.957
That's not a pattern;
that's just stains.

15:29.022 --> 15:31.172
May I remind all the children
that whoever finds

15:31.237 --> 15:33.902
the special item we're
looking for will get 50 bucks?

15:33.967 --> 15:35.773
Oh, yeah, we're looking
like crazy for that thing.

15:35.838 --> 15:38.641
We're just... um, th-this towel
situation came out of nowhere.

15:38.706 --> 15:41.656
- Oh, really?
- Speaking of rewards,

15:41.721 --> 15:44.336
I feel like you'd get that
special item way faster

15:44.401 --> 15:45.656
if you doubled it.

15:45.721 --> 15:47.411
Tina, Louise. A word.

15:47.476 --> 15:50.040
You're acting weird.
What's up with this towel crap?

15:50.105 --> 15:51.163
Girls, talk.

15:51.228 --> 15:53.109
We're not hiding anything, Mom,
you're hiding anything.

15:53.174 --> 15:56.210
And we haven't found anything,
either. So that's sett-settled.

15:56.286 --> 15:58.312
You found the
netsadoodle, didn't you?

15:58.377 --> 16:00.520
Pfft. Wh-What?
Pfft. As if.

16:00.649 --> 16:02.732
- Louise, am I wrong?
- What's it worth to you?

16:02.797 --> 16:04.865
- Louise.
- What? I can't negotiate?

16:04.984 --> 16:06.547
All right, here's the offer.

16:06.612 --> 16:08.594
Tell me where it is
and you're both not grounded.

16:08.659 --> 16:10.539
Here's my counteroffer:
you're grounded.

16:10.604 --> 16:12.581
These are terrible offers,
both of them.

16:12.659 --> 16:13.831
Where is it?!

16:13.896 --> 16:15.078
Teddy, come with me.

16:15.143 --> 16:17.579
There's a... fire
in the... toilet.

16:17.895 --> 16:20.203
A dummy pipe.
Course it's in a dummy pipe.

16:20.268 --> 16:21.716
I'm the dummy
that didn't think of that.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.378
You're not a dummy, Teddy.
You're a smarty.

16:23.443 --> 16:25.437
Because you found this all
on your own, remember?

16:25.502 --> 16:27.284
And Helen's gonna fall in love
with you because of it,

16:27.349 --> 16:29.633
and because of who you are
inside and stuff like that,

16:29.698 --> 16:31.797
- and not how you smell.
- Right. Sure.

16:31.862 --> 16:33.156
Ah! Let me see it.

16:33.221 --> 16:34.484
Linda, where are you?

16:34.549 --> 16:35.567
Helen. Ah!

16:35.645 --> 16:36.770
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:36.848 --> 16:37.802
Crap.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.612
Oh, Linda,
where'd my looking buddy go?

16:39.677 --> 16:41.415
You're the one that reaches
in all the gross places.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.041
Down in a sec!

16:43.106 --> 16:44.674
- Where'd it go?
- There it is.

16:48.664 --> 16:50.498
This looks totally safe.

16:50.565 --> 16:51.995
You know, if I, uh,
took a step or two,

16:52.060 --> 16:53.177
uh, I could probably get it.

16:53.242 --> 16:55.536
No. Lin, if anyone's going
out there, it should be me.

16:55.799 --> 16:58.176
Here I go. Cinderella time.

16:58.907 --> 17:02.043
Okay. Be careful, Teddy.
Try-try to be light.

17:02.110 --> 17:05.271
Yeah, I-I-I got to be really...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ah!

17:05.339 --> 17:07.248
Teddy! Are you all right?

17:07.315 --> 17:11.039
Yeah. I can easily hold on
for another... minute or less.

17:14.435 --> 17:16.980
- Teddy? Are you up there?!
- I am!

17:17.045 --> 17:19.010
- Are you okay?
- Uh, sort of.

17:19.075 --> 17:22.457
Well, uh, yeah, see, he found
the netslinky and then he, uh...

17:22.535 --> 17:24.855
He found the netsuke?
I'll be right up.

17:25.253 --> 17:28.531
- Oh, now I see him. Oh, Lordy.
- Crap, crap, crap, crap.

17:28.887 --> 17:31.470
We cleaned up the water,
we screwed the faucet back on...

17:31.535 --> 17:33.603
No, not all of it.
Not all the way. I mean,

17:33.668 --> 17:35.758
hopefully a real plumber
will come and fix everything.

17:35.823 --> 17:37.822
Yeah, but he won't have
a hot little son working

17:37.887 --> 17:38.912
with him like you do.

17:38.977 --> 17:40.224
Bob, come here.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.063
What the hell?
What happened?

17:42.128 --> 17:43.195
I don't want to talk about it.

17:43.260 --> 17:44.727
Should we call the
fire department?

17:44.792 --> 17:46.816
Sure, if they can come
in the next 20 seconds

17:46.881 --> 17:48.571
'cause my hands are starting
to slip.

17:48.636 --> 17:50.600
Can we get the elevator back
to his feet?

17:50.665 --> 17:52.280
But how do we do it?
It's broken.

17:52.345 --> 17:53.438
You got to do it manually.

17:53.503 --> 17:54.884
Th-Th-There's a lever
on the roof.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.587
It's a brake
for the counterweight.

17:56.652 --> 17:58.803
I-If you release it,
the elevator car should go up.

17:58.868 --> 18:01.064
Uh, okay, Teddy,
I-I'm going to the roof.

18:01.129 --> 18:04.048
The father and hot son plumbing
team is going to the roof!

18:04.113 --> 18:06.041
So, uh, where's the netsuke now?

18:06.106 --> 18:08.437
- Helen, hi.
- Hi, Teddy.

18:08.502 --> 18:09.872
I found that thing
that you want.

18:09.937 --> 18:12.629
Yes, I know.
Thank you very, very much.

18:12.694 --> 18:14.754
- Where is it?
- I kind of lost track of it.

18:14.819 --> 18:17.196
Last time I saw it, it was
on the roof of the elevator.

18:18.768 --> 18:19.947
There it is.

18:21.947 --> 18:23.140
Whoa.

18:23.205 --> 18:24.386
Are you up there?!

18:24.451 --> 18:27.044
Yeah! We-we found the pulleys
and stuff!

18:27.109 --> 18:29.899
- Great!
- And it doesn't look complicated at all!

18:29.964 --> 18:32.184
Do you know which one we're
supposed to pull? Or push?

18:32.249 --> 18:33.446
I have no idea.

18:33.511 --> 18:35.159
Dad, just guess the right one.

18:35.224 --> 18:37.196
Okay, okay, uh...

18:37.302 --> 18:39.713
- Did that work?
- No.

18:39.835 --> 18:41.707
- Did that work?
- No!

18:41.772 --> 18:44.199
- This is our process.
- Hang on, Teddy.

18:44.264 --> 18:46.008
Okay, trying another one!

18:46.311 --> 18:48.871
- It's working.
- Wait, wait, wait. Stop. Stop!

18:48.936 --> 18:50.154
Uh, okay, stopping.

18:50.232 --> 18:51.349
Why?

18:51.427 --> 18:54.137
- Uh, wha-what's going on?
- If the elevator keeps going up,

18:54.202 --> 18:55.574
my netsuke could fall off
and break.

18:55.639 --> 18:56.903
But if the elevator
doesn't go up,

18:56.968 --> 18:58.285
then Teddy will fall.

18:58.350 --> 19:00.773
Probably. I have no feeling left
in my hands.

19:00.838 --> 19:02.494
But there's a chance
he might not fall.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.141
And that's just a risk
we'll have to take.

19:04.206 --> 19:05.731
What? Are you serious?

19:05.796 --> 19:07.878
Don't say it like that.
He'll be fine. Maybe.

19:07.943 --> 19:10.386
- Oh, my God, Helen's horrible.
- Yeah, she is.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.445
I don't know if I can hold on
much longer.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.278
Uh, okay, I'm pushing it again.

19:14.374 --> 19:16.344
- No!
- Yes, push it!

19:18.172 --> 19:19.390
Ohh! Gotcha!

19:19.500 --> 19:20.930
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

19:21.008 --> 19:22.143
I-I'm slipping.

19:22.397 --> 19:25.125
- Are you okay?!
- I-I am okay.

19:26.187 --> 19:29.368
We did it. We saved Teddy
and fixed the faucet.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.001
We... we didn't fix the faucet.

19:31.066 --> 19:32.774
Uh, getting a little close
to the ceiling, Bob.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.446
Want to push that lever back
the other way?

19:34.511 --> 19:36.576
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Doing it.

19:36.641 --> 19:38.589
- Teddy. Oh, you're okay.
- Teddy. Oh, thank God.

19:38.654 --> 19:39.676
Get in here.

19:39.741 --> 19:41.406
Cool. Glad you're okay, Teddy.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.751
That's good.
Well, got to go, you guys,

19:43.816 --> 19:45.314
you know, maybe to
an auction house, maybe not.

19:45.379 --> 19:46.423
Who knows how late
they're even open.

19:46.488 --> 19:48.019
Whoa, whoa, whoa-hey!

19:48.084 --> 19:49.767
What, that's it?
What about the reward?

19:49.832 --> 19:51.764
Well, here's the problem.
No cash.

19:51.829 --> 19:53.985
- Oh, my God.
- Ooh, online gift card?

19:54.050 --> 19:56.143
- Check your e-mail. Bye.
- Ugh, no. Wha...

19:56.219 --> 19:57.345
Oh, my netsuke.

19:57.410 --> 19:59.310
Yeah. That's the loose board.

19:59.871 --> 20:01.884
Ah. Just a little crack.
It's okay. It's...

20:03.066 --> 20:05.385
Ah, son of a bitch! It broke!

20:05.674 --> 20:07.535
Stupid cat. Stupid snails.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.933
- Stupid dead Larry!
- Keep in touch.

20:10.431 --> 20:13.006
So, Larry had
a secret apartment.

20:13.071 --> 20:15.253
Uh, seems healthy.

20:15.318 --> 20:17.488
Teddy, I'm so sorry
I almost got you killed

20:17.586 --> 20:18.929
getting the Napster back.

20:18.994 --> 20:21.030
I was on a crazy
matchmaking high.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.760
- Netsuke.
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

20:22.877 --> 20:24.312
- Nescafé.
- Perfect.

20:24.812 --> 20:25.890
Mmm, that's good.

20:25.955 --> 20:28.327
I'm sorry, too, Teddy. If I
hadn't re-hidden that thing,

20:28.392 --> 20:30.194
you never would have been
in that elevator shaft.

20:30.259 --> 20:31.558
I forgive you guys.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.295
You were thinking
of my best interests.

20:33.388 --> 20:34.687
Kinda. Maybe.

20:34.752 --> 20:37.679
You know, I thought looking
for the thingy was a fairy tale,

20:37.744 --> 20:40.193
and Teddy was supposed to end up
with the young rich princess.

20:40.258 --> 20:42.817
But maybe not.
Maybe he's supposed to end up

20:42.882 --> 20:44.926
with a nice princess
in sweatpants.

20:45.093 --> 20:46.181
Wait, what's going on?

20:46.246 --> 20:48.299
Shh, shh, shh.
Kathleen, didn't you have

20:48.364 --> 20:49.780
a wobbly cabinet door
in your kitchen?

20:49.845 --> 20:51.001
Yeah, they're all wobbly.

20:51.066 --> 20:52.726
Want Teddy to handyman it up?

20:52.791 --> 20:54.960
Oh, yeah, Teddy, you want
to take a look at that?

20:55.025 --> 20:57.360
I don't know. I-I can't move
my fingers very well.

20:57.458 --> 20:59.654
Uh, is that water
coming in under the door?

20:59.719 --> 21:00.727
On it.
