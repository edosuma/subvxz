WEBVTT

01:55.858 --> 02:00.462
Today is the day someone will prove to me
that they are worthy of not just a paycheck,

02:00.495 --> 02:02.865
but a
journey into the unknown.

02:05.034 --> 02:07.669
I have
had the honor, with a hard "U,"

02:07.703 --> 02:09.906
- like the Europeans do, "The Honeur."
- Hor-uh-ner.

02:09.939 --> 02:11.174
What did I say?

02:11.207 --> 02:16.112
You said "honeur." It's a hard,
but also soft. It's a soft "H."

02:16.145 --> 02:20.750
I have had the honor of being bell captain
of this fine establishment for 12 years.

02:20.783 --> 02:23.351
And a common bellman for 10
years before that.

02:23.385 --> 02:28.090
You might be asking yourself, "How has
this guy had the same job for 27 years?"

02:28.891 --> 02:30.760
I don't need to progress.

02:30.793 --> 02:33.996
I don't need success in the eyes
of my father, wherever he is,

02:34.030 --> 02:37.700
I don't need to do things like prove
my worth to the love of my life

02:37.733 --> 02:40.535
that I let slip away and would
do anything to get back.

02:40.569 --> 02:44.472
And I'm saying anything, like,
if she came up on this roof right now...

02:47.576 --> 02:48.845
It's enough chit chat.

02:50.445 --> 02:51.580
Let's do this.

02:52.447 --> 02:53.515
Tyler's right.

02:54.516 --> 02:56.351
The time is nigh.

03:03.625 --> 03:06.461
Mm, mm-hmm. Nice.
That'll work.

03:07.930 --> 03:11.868
When we first started, there were
12 potential bellmen in training.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.368
The field is now down
to three.

03:15.637 --> 03:18.007
Psst! Steve. Two guys.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.143
I see. As it turns out, there
are only two of you.

03:25.214 --> 03:29.719
Whoever passes this competition will
enter into final bellman certification,

03:29.752 --> 03:31.988
in which there are three stages
to your initiation.

03:32.021 --> 03:33.622
Let's do this!

03:35.057 --> 03:36.125
Oh, dear God.

03:45.201 --> 03:46.635
On your mark,

03:48.804 --> 03:52.808
get set, and go.

04:47.029 --> 04:49.732
Congrats, B.I.T. You've won the
elimination round.

04:49.765 --> 04:52.667
Passing the first stage is a
pretty big deal.

04:52.702 --> 04:54.704
Be proud, very few make
it this far.

04:54.737 --> 04:55.871
Mm-hm.

04:55.905 --> 04:58.174
C'mon. I wanna show
you something.

04:59.141 --> 05:01.010
Ah! Hello?

05:07.149 --> 05:09.018
<i>Um. Hello?</i>

05:09.051 --> 05:11.553
<i>Shh. You're safe.</i>

05:12.388 --> 05:14.757
<i>Ow! Someone punched me, Steve.</i>

05:14.790 --> 05:16.892
<i>Tyler, did you punch
Josh?</i>

05:16.926 --> 05:18.995
<i>Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.</i>

05:29.604 --> 05:30.906
Check it out.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.208
The Bellman Hall of Fame.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.276
All the greats are up there.

05:34.310 --> 05:35.244
You know who that is?

05:36.278 --> 05:37.179
Sid Whitman.

05:37.213 --> 05:40.016
He started here as a
bellman, just like us.

05:40.049 --> 05:42.650
Worked his way up the ladder and
bought the hotel.

05:42.685 --> 05:44.552
Could I work my way
up the ladder?

05:45.354 --> 05:46.222
Sure.

05:47.323 --> 05:49.091
How come you never worked
your way up the ladder?

05:50.993 --> 05:52.695
Yeah, we're having a good time.

05:54.330 --> 05:56.198
Who's the cactus?

05:56.232 --> 05:59.902
That's Sauggie. Best
bellman I ever worked with.

05:59.935 --> 06:02.805
Sauggie once stacked 22
bags on one bell cart.

06:02.838 --> 06:04.006
Still an Arizona record!

06:04.040 --> 06:06.608
Sauggie once revived a woman
who passed away in the lobby.

06:06.641 --> 06:09.078
- A week later.
- Still an Arizona record.

06:09.111 --> 06:12.715
When Sauggie left, he took a
piece of me with him.

06:14.083 --> 06:17.153
Miss you, Sauggie, miss you
every day.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.288
Where did Sauggie go?

06:19.321 --> 06:20.923
No one knows.

06:22.224 --> 06:23.658
What?

06:23.692 --> 06:27.096
Nobody knows. He just didn't show
up to work one day, no explanation.

06:27.129 --> 06:29.331
The police searched for weeks.
He just vanished.

06:30.232 --> 06:31.633
Miss him every day.

06:32.835 --> 06:34.136
It's all right here in
the <i>Bellman Handbook </i>.

06:36.638 --> 06:37.306
Go ahead.

06:43.312 --> 06:47.783
So just to be clear, cactus
was a revered bellman

06:47.817 --> 06:49.218
who mysteriously disappeared

06:50.252 --> 06:52.188
and his return is something
everyone covets.

06:52.922 --> 06:54.924
- Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- That's spot on.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.792
- It's the story they're all going with.
- 100%

06:56.826 --> 06:59.627
Yeah. Okay. I'm just making sure
that's where we're going with this.

06:59.661 --> 07:03.032
Come on, let's get
you into uniform.

07:03.065 --> 07:04.533
- <i>Hey, Steve.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

07:04.567 --> 07:08.370
Here's today's checkouts. There's
also a handful early check-ins today.

07:08.404 --> 07:11.407
Last night we were at 80% but
tonight's going to be at full capacity.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.674
I can't wait.

07:13.876 --> 07:16.712
Josh, the goal here is to make
as much in tips as possible.

07:16.745 --> 07:20.049
Now you achieve that by giving
great service 24/7, all right?

07:20.082 --> 07:22.885
Remind the guests if they don't
have cash, all good,

07:22.918 --> 07:25.020
they can get
Bravo, the new tipping app.

07:25.054 --> 07:26.822
Okay, let's get this party
started.

07:26.856 --> 07:28.357
All right!

07:29.725 --> 07:30.392
What was that?

07:36.065 --> 07:36.999
Oh, woah.

07:38.134 --> 07:41.737
- Um, you are a big man.
- I'm the runt of the litter.

07:41.770 --> 07:43.973
- You want 1.8 for that property?
- Hey, what's up?

07:44.006 --> 07:46.142
Yeah, I can get you 1.2 if
you're lucky. Come on in.

07:46.175 --> 07:49.945
- Hi, I'm Rhonda.
- One of us is not ready yet, but we'll be ready soon.

07:51.313 --> 07:52.915
Hi, I'm Jesus.

07:53.816 --> 07:55.650
Can we take your
bag for you, sir?

07:57.786 --> 07:59.955
Oh!

07:59.989 --> 08:02.657
Sure thing, Mr. Ketterer.
He's on his way and he won't be late.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.727
JJ.

08:07.363 --> 08:08.931
Hi, I'm Tyler. I'm your bellman.

08:08.964 --> 08:10.132
Hey, my name is JJ.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.734
You're the bellman.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.303
A couple of houses on the market that
have been sitting there for the last year

08:14.336 --> 08:17.740
and you're trying to tell... did you just
look at a watch that wasn't on your hand?

08:17.773 --> 08:18.807
I have an itch.

08:18.841 --> 08:21.210
No, man. This is really new to
me. But I feel bad.

08:21.243 --> 08:25.381
I usually don't have people help me
do it and oh... I can't believe it.

08:25.414 --> 08:26.448
Mother Bear.

08:26.482 --> 08:29.018
- I'll take this here.
- No, no. I'm not ready yet.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.787
- How about I just take this one then?
- Oh, no. I'm not quite finished.

08:32.421 --> 08:34.289
Rhonda, will you help
me fold these?

08:34.323 --> 08:35.791
Oh, I'd prefer not to.

08:35.823 --> 08:37.226
So, can I bring these
down for you?

08:38.527 --> 08:39.794
What do you think?

08:42.831 --> 08:43.866
I don't know.

08:43.899 --> 08:44.833
No.

08:46.035 --> 08:48.103
This is greatly appreciated.
Have a great rest of your day.

08:48.137 --> 08:50.139
- That's good.
- Yeah, okay. Good.

08:50.172 --> 08:52.942
- And that's for you.
- Oh, you are too kind.

08:52.975 --> 08:55.411
No, no, no. We got to keep
it organized, baby.

08:55.444 --> 08:58.480
- What is two dollars?
- Let's get this show on the road.

08:58.514 --> 09:01.283
- Oh, those are binoculars.
- Those are binoculars.

09:01.317 --> 09:02.384
<i>Bravo!</i>

09:03.085 --> 09:05.788
Excuse me, could you...

09:06.922 --> 09:08.190
Steve?

09:09.525 --> 09:10.793
Houseman?

09:11.527 --> 09:15.798
Wow, it's me, Dave Myers.

09:15.831 --> 09:17.066
Dick-face Dave.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.368
You used
to say that all the...

09:19.401 --> 09:22.037
- Dave Myers. Right.
- Yeah.

09:22.071 --> 09:24.306
What... What
are you doing here in Tucson?

09:24.340 --> 09:28.444
Spirifresh, the spiritual
mind refreshment retreat.

09:28.477 --> 09:30.312
- Sounds refreshing.
- Ooh.

09:33.849 --> 09:34.516
So,

09:36.252 --> 09:37.920
can you help
me to my room?

09:37.953 --> 09:40.089
Oh, duh.

09:40.122 --> 09:45.094
You know Tucson has the most days of
sunshine of any city in the entire US.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.896
And one of the
most popular golf destinations.

09:47.930 --> 09:50.332
Steve Houseman, this is crazy.

09:51.200 --> 09:55.004
I mean, I thought you were all
like running a tech company...

09:55.037 --> 09:56.839
win... winning Super Bowl's.

09:58.841 --> 10:00.442
Oh, yeah. No.

10:01.277 --> 10:03.045
You've had this job since
high school, right?

10:03.879 --> 10:05.281
Yeah, yeah. Good memory.

10:05.314 --> 10:08.183
Still. Same job, still.
Still a bellman.

10:08.851 --> 10:11.420
Well actually now, I
am the bell captain.

10:11.453 --> 10:12.921
Oh, ahoy!

10:12.955 --> 10:16.258
So, after Kate got pregnant with Maddie,
she quit her job at the tech firm.

10:16.292 --> 10:19.595
I make enough money for the both of us,
so, and she is such a wonderful mother.

10:19.628 --> 10:23.098
It's really... I just
love having a family.

10:23.132 --> 10:26.168
It's like the most great thing
you can ever imagine. Ouch!

10:27.036 --> 10:29.171
- No, it's okay. I'm good.
- It's a tight squeeze.

10:29.204 --> 10:31.540
You can just put it right there.
Just...

10:33.208 --> 10:34.209
Yeah, wow.

10:34.877 --> 10:35.544
Steve.

10:36.713 --> 10:38.380
It's great to see you. You're
really good at this, man.

10:38.414 --> 10:39.381
I appreciate it.

10:39.415 --> 10:40.349
Yeah.

10:40.382 --> 10:42.451
- All right, well. Enjoy your stay.
- Oh.

10:46.989 --> 10:48.891
Ah, thank you.

10:49.325 --> 10:50.192
Money.

10:50.993 --> 10:54.063
Money. Ooh, money.

10:54.897 --> 10:56.231
Eh. Uh, no.

11:00.269 --> 11:01.603
You know...

11:07.543 --> 11:09.912
- Trying to leave.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:17.119 --> 11:18.187
It's a game.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.321
Got a busy day.

11:21.490 --> 11:23.359
Getting weird
every time you stop me.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.963
Dave, I've never beat anybody up
in this hotel before.

11:27.996 --> 11:28.864
Yeah.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.301
- All right.
- Okay.

11:32.334 --> 11:34.937
- See you around, Dave.
- Yeah, I'll see you around Dave... Steve.

11:45.647 --> 11:48.384
<i>♪ When he
was a boy He would dream ♪</i>

11:48.417 --> 11:51.453

11:58.728 --> 11:59.595
Kelly.

12:01.663 --> 12:03.298
- I didn't know you'd be...
- Oh!

12:04.032 --> 12:05.434
Oh, shh!

12:06.969 --> 12:08.303
Do you need help?

12:09.104 --> 12:09.972
Thanks.

12:19.749 --> 12:21.049
I got to go to the lobby.

12:23.485 --> 12:24.987
- It's that way.
- Okay.

12:33.595 --> 12:36.265
Oh, you guys have a
bar and grill, nice.

12:36.298 --> 12:37.966
Yeah, you can really
get lit there.

12:50.612 --> 12:52.014
- What's your name?
- Josh.

12:52.047 --> 12:55.050
I don't care. Don't talk to me.
Everything goes through Tyler, okay?

12:56.084 --> 12:57.419
Okay. Yes, sir.

12:57.453 --> 12:58.954
- Just...
- Sorry, sir.

12:58.987 --> 13:02.524
I'm with him right now. Hold on one sec.
I need the keys to the golf course.

13:03.726 --> 13:05.093
Excuse me?

13:05.127 --> 13:07.697
The keys to the golf course,
you're supposed to keep them on hand.

13:07.730 --> 13:08.597
Ah...

13:11.533 --> 13:14.603
Wow, first day and we
can't trust you.

13:15.604 --> 13:17.539
- You can pack up your things.
- I don't have things.

13:17.573 --> 13:18.640
Even better.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.743
You're fired, you got 10 minutes
to vacate the property

13:20.777 --> 13:22.511
or I'll have you
arrested for trespassing.

13:23.278 --> 13:24.179
No.

13:26.048 --> 13:26.716
Yes.

13:28.685 --> 13:31.587
Josh, I'm messing with you, man.

13:34.122 --> 13:35.725
I'm Michael, Front
Office Manager.

13:35.758 --> 13:38.393
Hey. Josh, I'm B.I.T.

13:38.427 --> 13:39.361
Yeah, I know.

13:39.394 --> 13:40.429
Hey, guys.

13:40.462 --> 13:41.731
Steve, morning, brother.

13:41.764 --> 13:43.800
Met the new guy. Hit
him with the classic.

13:43.833 --> 13:45.601
Nice. You know, Josh.

13:45.634 --> 13:47.669
I trained Michael when he
got hired here as a bellman.

13:47.704 --> 13:50.506
Couple of years later he took a dump
on my face and took a promotion.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.141
Weird that I'd want a salary and
health insurance for the family.

13:53.175 --> 13:54.510
Did he really take a
dump on your face?

13:54.543 --> 13:57.446
If any of you guys, notwithstanding
Steve, ever want to move up,

13:57.479 --> 13:59.248
let me know, the
door is always open.

13:59.281 --> 14:00.717
And become like you or Alan?

14:00.750 --> 14:03.619
- Who's Alan?
- Department head meeting in 15 minutes, Steve, don't be late.

14:03.652 --> 14:06.088
Yes, sir, got it marked right
here in my palm pilot.

14:08.725 --> 14:10.292
- Who's this?
- B.I.T.

14:10.325 --> 14:12.094
No thanks. I just ate.
What's your name?

14:12.695 --> 14:13.562
Josh.

14:14.429 --> 14:16.733
Joshua, is it? I should
write you up.

14:17.599 --> 14:18.768
Oh yeah?

14:19.869 --> 14:22.371
Oh, you're
gonna write me up?

14:25.541 --> 14:27.744
I... I should write you up

14:27.777 --> 14:31.046
for that penis head.

14:32.849 --> 14:35.083
- One demerit!
- We don't have demerits, Alan.

14:35.117 --> 14:35.818
Well, we will.

14:35.852 --> 14:38.587
I'm trying to
implement them.

14:38.620 --> 14:40.122
You will be watched.

14:40.155 --> 14:44.159
You will be fired, if
you talk to me like that again.

14:44.192 --> 14:45.494
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

14:45.527 --> 14:46.595
Sir.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.131
Good.

14:50.365 --> 14:52.100
11 minutes till the meeting.

14:52.134 --> 14:52.802
Can't wait.

14:53.468 --> 14:54.536
One demerit.

14:55.404 --> 14:56.672
So, that's Alan.

14:56.706 --> 14:59.341
- Ah.
- Good to meet you. Steve, I'll catch you at the meeting.

14:59.374 --> 15:00.542
Yeah.

15:01.744 --> 15:03.545
- First early check-in of the day.
- Thank you, Stacey.

15:03.579 --> 15:04.681
No problem.

15:05.982 --> 15:08.317
All right, you heard her, B.I.T.
Get out and help that lady.

15:08.350 --> 15:11.153
- Alone?
- Oh, yeah. No better way to learn.

15:13.422 --> 15:15.290
Yeah, okay.

15:16.525 --> 15:17.760
No problemo.

15:17.794 --> 15:18.828
You got this.

15:20.562 --> 15:21.430
Here we go.

15:22.331 --> 15:23.700
Josh's time to shine.

15:25.267 --> 15:26.134
Who are you talking to?

15:26.869 --> 15:27.737
What?

15:28.771 --> 15:29.806
No... no one.

15:35.745 --> 15:38.380
Hi, I'm Josh. I'm the new B.I.T.
I was wondering if I could...

15:38.413 --> 15:41.684
Welcome to King Saguaro Hotel.
May I have your last name, please?

15:41.718 --> 15:43.786
- It's Long.
- No problem. I've got room on ticket.

15:43.820 --> 15:46.288
Oh, no, no. My name
is Sheila Long.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.523
Oh, of course. Miss Long.

15:48.557 --> 15:50.626
Good morning, ma'am. Can I help...

15:50.659 --> 15:53.161
Oh, my, what happened?

15:53.195 --> 15:56.331
Bellmen are clumsy and stupid.

15:56.365 --> 15:57.800
Yeah. Please. Come
right this way.

16:04.774 --> 16:07.342
Listen up, Josh.

16:07.877 --> 16:10.646
Do not encroach on us when we're
talking with guests.

16:10.680 --> 16:11.814
Why not?

16:11.848 --> 16:14.282
'Coz you get smashed in the
head with a suitcase, bro.

16:14.316 --> 16:19.287
Now, go back to ding-a-ling desk
with other ding-a-lings. Ding-a-ling.

16:19.789 --> 16:20.690
Ding-a-ling.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.942
Steve.

16:39.976 --> 16:42.879
A few years ago, we were honored to host the
Susan B. Anthony Memorial Golf Tournament.

16:42.912 --> 16:45.948
Needless to say, we were
slammed. Cars were piling up.

16:45.982 --> 16:50.218
So, I took the initiative to help
and valeted a nice woman's Mercedes

16:50.252 --> 16:52.254
and the brothers did
not like that.

16:52.287 --> 16:56.625
In retaliation, they peed on
every single bell cart.

16:56.658 --> 16:58.895
Yeah. Things have been
contentious between us ever since.

16:58.928 --> 17:01.229
You would know that if you
read the <i>Bellmen Handbook </i>.

17:01.263 --> 17:02.497
You just gave me the handbook...

17:02.531 --> 17:04.067
You should have it
memorized, you idiot!

17:04.099 --> 17:09.872
Yeah, you idiot. All right. I got to go
to a meeting. Josh, you're in charge.

17:09.906 --> 17:11.239
Really?

17:11.272 --> 17:11.941
Nope.

17:13.608 --> 17:15.377
- Come on, think.
- Hey, Brad.

17:15.912 --> 17:17.212
Watch this.

17:18.681 --> 17:21.516
Hi, welcome to the hotel.
Let me grab these for you.

17:21.550 --> 17:23.019
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

17:23.051 --> 17:26.221
You know it was my idea to
do an all-female <i>Ghostbusters</i>.

17:26.756 --> 17:27.990
You really are an idiot.

17:29.357 --> 17:31.560
Explain to me the difference
between Radicchio and Arugula.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.596
Radicchio has no...
how do you say?

17:38.735 --> 17:40.002
I didn't take a single one.

17:40.036 --> 17:41.871
You didn't take any? Oh man.

17:52.547 --> 17:54.316
All right everyone, let's be
Quiet please.

17:54.349 --> 17:56.418
We have a lot to get through and
not a lot of time.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.419
Alan, what time is it?

17:58.320 --> 18:00.723
Alan, it's
a flip phone, just flip it.

18:02.657 --> 18:03.893
Alan, what time is it?

18:05.494 --> 18:07.096
- Michael, what time is it?
- 10:25 a.m.

18:07.130 --> 18:10.733
Quick rundown time of everything today,
shall we? Guillaume, what's in season?

18:10.767 --> 18:12.969
- Cacti are always in season.
- Ah, ha-ha. Don't I know it?

18:13.002 --> 18:16.072
- Ted, what do you got for me?
- We're close to discovering the source of the smell

18:16.105 --> 18:18.473
coming from the air ducts on the
third floor.

18:18.507 --> 18:20.743
And we all sincerely
hope that you do. Louisa.

18:20.777 --> 18:22.611
Our robe inventory is
diminishing.

18:22.644 --> 18:25.413
Until we put a stop
to this robe thievery,

18:25.447 --> 18:27.917
only the people who really need
robes will get them.

18:27.950 --> 18:30.987
Very troubling. Alan, please
find the culprit.

18:31.020 --> 18:33.055
And Patty,
how are the puppets?

18:33.089 --> 18:34.056
Oh, you know, we good.

18:34.090 --> 18:35.892
Oh! Thanks Patty.

18:35.925 --> 18:37.794
We have a lot of
events this weekend.

18:37.827 --> 18:40.428
I want to keep everyone apprised
of where everything is going on.

18:40.462 --> 18:42.832
In the Sahuarita Ballroom we
have the Moishevitz Bar Mitzvah.

18:42.865 --> 18:44.801
Please have the
first aid kit ready.

18:44.834 --> 18:47.904
And in the Tanque Verde Ballroom we
have the 4th Annual Toddler Ball.

18:47.937 --> 18:50.338
So plenty of juice boxes and
goldfish.

18:50.372 --> 18:53.475
In the Saddlebrooke
Ballroom we have Spirifresh,

18:53.508 --> 18:55.577
the Spiritual Mind Refreshment
Retreat.

18:55.610 --> 18:57.947
Now for anyone who is interested
in attending Spirifresh,

18:57.980 --> 19:00.850
they are offering a 4% employee
discount.

19:04.386 --> 19:06.856
Now you might recognize that we
are at a 100% capacity this weekend

19:06.889 --> 19:09.992
and we have some V-very
I-important P's showing up,

19:10.026 --> 19:13.361
including our owner,
Sid Whitman.

19:13.395 --> 19:18.768
And everyone join me in congratulating
Kelly on joining Les Clefs d'Or,

19:18.801 --> 19:22.470
the national organization of
lobby concierges.

19:22.504 --> 19:24.907
Kelly, we appreciate people
whose commitment to excellence

19:24.941 --> 19:29.644
earns them honors like these and makes us
look good in the process. So, thank you.

19:35.417 --> 19:36.719
<i>Mazel tov </i>, baby.

19:36.752 --> 19:37.652
Thanks, Patty.

19:39.021 --> 19:43.391
And thank you, Susan. I'm honored
to share this table with all of you.

19:43.425 --> 19:47.763
Every one of you makes my job
easier. Except for Steve.

19:49.664 --> 19:51.133
Meeting is over.

20:03.846 --> 20:04.714
Kelly.

20:05.748 --> 20:07.415
- Kelly.
- What, Steve?

20:07.449 --> 20:08.684
Congrats on the pin thingy.

20:11.087 --> 20:15.157
It's Les Clefs d'Or,
not a pin thingy.

20:16.524 --> 20:17.994
What are you doing right now?

20:18.027 --> 20:19.128
I'm working.

20:20.029 --> 20:21.063
I got a promotion.

20:24.200 --> 20:28.170
I was interviewing and crushing it
so they were like enough is enough.

20:28.204 --> 20:31.741
Let's start the transition. To
the top is where I'm headed.

20:31.774 --> 20:33.976
So, just thought
you should know that.

20:34.710 --> 20:39.547
Congratulations. Maybe I'll be
seeing you at the adult table.

20:39.581 --> 20:43.085
Maybe I'll look in your direction
at the table when you see me there.

20:43.853 --> 20:45.154
I'll be the guy
looking at you.

20:49.892 --> 20:51.127
Michael, this is Steve.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.061
Michael.

20:52.094 --> 20:53.662
I need you in the garden ASAP.

21:02.671 --> 21:04.240
God! Jesus, come on.

21:04.273 --> 21:06.508
- What's up, dude?
- Oh, hey. I need your help.

21:06.541 --> 21:09.011
Hmm. Pretty sure the favor scale
is leaning heavily in my favor.

21:09.045 --> 21:13.615
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. I just lied to
Kelly. I told her I was getting promoted.

21:13.648 --> 21:14.784
Why would you do that?

21:14.817 --> 21:17.853
I don't know, man. I just miss
her. I want another shot.

21:17.887 --> 21:19.654
Well, lying to her
is a great start.

21:19.689 --> 21:21.157
- You gonna help me or not?
- Of course.

21:21.190 --> 21:24.026
But I can't just promote you out
of thin air. It's a process.

21:24.060 --> 21:26.762
- If you were a manager, you'd know that.
- Great, so make me a manager.

21:26.796 --> 21:29.664
All right, I'll see what I can do.
But you got to keep your nose clean.

21:29.699 --> 21:32.234
- Right, if Alan catches you doing anything...
- I can handle Alan.

21:32.268 --> 21:34.136
No messing around.
You can't get in trouble.

21:34.170 --> 21:36.504
I'll keep a low profile. I'll
hide in the bell closet.

21:36.538 --> 21:38.540
How come I never get to hang
out in the bell closet?

21:38.573 --> 21:40.109
Because you abandoned us.

21:41.877 --> 21:43.946
I deserved that.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.181
All right, so what's our move?

21:45.214 --> 21:46.716
Try to convince Susan to give
you a shot.

21:46.749 --> 21:50.019
Show her some numbers, tell her I need
an Assistant Front Office Manager.

21:50.052 --> 21:52.254
Great, thank you. Hey, uh...

21:54.323 --> 21:59.295
Let's just keep this a Mike, Steve
thing, you know. Guys don't need to know.

21:59.328 --> 22:03.565
- Why not?
- The whole "being a bell captain for life" is kind of my thing.

22:03.598 --> 22:08.704
- You're killing me, man.
- I know, okay. I'll get you back. I'll get you robes.

22:08.738 --> 22:10.538
- Robes?
- Yeah.

22:10.572 --> 22:11.841
Damn it.

22:11.874 --> 22:13.575
I got plenty of robes at home.

22:13.608 --> 22:14.977
Then just tell me that.

22:16.312 --> 22:19.148
- Let's get back inside before someone suspects something.
- Yeah.

22:39.802 --> 22:42.071
Oh, hey. Steve! This is Gunther.

22:42.104 --> 22:44.907
He is a very important P.

22:45.975 --> 22:49.779
Gunther. Hi, I'm Steve,
the bell captain.

22:49.812 --> 22:53.615
Steve, yes.

22:55.151 --> 22:58.087
Stress, but it's not work
related.

23:00.089 --> 23:03.225
A good soul, unfulfilled.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.797
But Steve can dance.

23:10.232 --> 23:12.134
No. No, he can't.

23:13.369 --> 23:16.005
Um, I can dance.

23:17.206 --> 23:19.008
So, you think you can dance?

23:22.078 --> 23:24.579
In your face, Steve. He
pegged you good, Steve.

23:25.147 --> 23:28.784
That was good.

23:30.953 --> 23:34.223
I make this joke because there
is a famous show,

23:34.256 --> 23:38.828
a television show has the same moniker
as these words I just said to you.

23:38.861 --> 23:41.297
I have not seen it because my
studies show,

23:41.330 --> 23:45.667
television is observation from a
distance, yeah?

23:46.135 --> 23:48.204
Yeah, but you... yes.

23:48.237 --> 23:49.738
You Steve, captain.

23:49.772 --> 23:51.307
Yes, you can dance.

23:51.340 --> 23:54.376
The universe loves you,
so do I.

23:55.344 --> 23:57.980
But we always safe, so safe.

23:58.981 --> 24:01.717
Here is Sanz Hands
hand sanitizer.

24:02.351 --> 24:03.319
That's a lot.

24:07.256 --> 24:08.891
Okay.

24:08.924 --> 24:11.060
Sorry, you're just so cute,
I can't help myself.

24:15.364 --> 24:17.867
These girls are
definitely feeling us.

24:17.900 --> 24:21.437
Gunther can jump hella far, bro.

24:21.470 --> 24:23.372
- Hella far.
- Why does that matter?

24:23.405 --> 24:27.143
You are so lucky because tonight
I am hosting

24:27.176 --> 24:30.779
one of my very rare seminars

24:30.813 --> 24:32.848
right here in the
conference room.

24:32.882 --> 24:35.417
It only happen two,

24:35.451 --> 24:38.420
maybe three times in a
weekend.

24:38.454 --> 24:41.223
So, I trust I will see
all of you there?

24:41.257 --> 24:43.292
We will definitely be there.
Are you kidding me?

24:43.325 --> 24:44.760
A kid is a baby goat.

24:46.729 --> 24:51.400
Laughter is organic message of
the universe and yet,

24:51.433 --> 24:55.237
no human
vessel can contain it.

24:55.271 --> 24:56.138
Yeah.

24:56.939 --> 24:57.973
Hmm.

24:59.575 --> 25:01.477
Make sure you go to the website because
the tickets, they go like hot cakes.

25:01.510 --> 25:03.045
You know, they go so
fast.

25:03.078 --> 25:05.047
- Paid.
- Ah, look how fast.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.749
- Paid.
- So fast still.

25:06.782 --> 25:09.151
Yeah, we're gonna need to check
our schedules

25:09.185 --> 25:10.886
before we can commit.

25:18.327 --> 25:22.097
When they commit to the seminar
what are they...

25:22.131 --> 25:23.399
what are they paying for?

25:23.432 --> 25:24.466
Steve,

25:25.134 --> 25:27.770
Steve is the captain.
Captain Steve.

25:28.370 --> 25:30.039
Just like the mouse...

25:31.073 --> 25:32.041
the mouth

25:34.777 --> 25:36.879
craves hydration.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.314
Yeah, okay?

25:38.347 --> 25:41.217
So the mind crave...

25:43.552 --> 25:45.254
what is
human word for this?

25:48.324 --> 25:49.191
Knowledge.

25:52.561 --> 25:54.964
Do you know that the human brain

25:54.997 --> 25:57.833
only uses 14% capacity?

25:59.568 --> 26:05.007
The dog
uses 24% of the human brain.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.042
How, Gunther?
I will tell you tonight.

26:07.076 --> 26:08.811
I will tell you
tonight at the seminar.

26:11.213 --> 26:12.281
I can't wait, man.

26:12.314 --> 26:13.749
Why are we clapping?

26:13.782 --> 26:18.988
Spirifresh has enlightened my brain
to know what my body is capable of.

26:20.122 --> 26:22.791
Don't you want to know what our
bodies are capable of?

26:22.825 --> 26:23.659
- Yes.
- Yes.

26:23.693 --> 26:26.028
- Definitely. 100%.
- At the seminar...

26:26.061 --> 26:28.998
Really I just work here during the
day, but my nights is off.

26:29.932 --> 26:32.468
So now we must go up to the
room, okay, we unwind,

26:32.501 --> 26:35.971
we meditate and then we make
love 1000 times.

26:36.005 --> 26:41.977
But first what always is...
what always is... what always is safe?

26:42.478 --> 26:43.879
Yes, safe.

26:45.981 --> 26:46.849
My Lord.

26:49.451 --> 26:53.889
Yes. Safe. Super safe. Yes.

26:55.224 --> 26:56.726
Can you help me with my bags?

26:56.760 --> 27:02.164
They're really heavy and your hands
look so strong and sexually satisfying.

27:04.333 --> 27:05.367
Yup.

27:07.336 --> 27:08.837
<i>Allons y </i>.

27:09.438 --> 27:10.839
Have fun.

27:18.314 --> 27:19.548
Who's she?

27:19.581 --> 27:21.950
Kelly. Chief Concierge.

27:22.451 --> 27:24.853
She's like the bell captain of
concierges.

27:25.387 --> 27:27.089
Seems like you love her.

27:27.990 --> 27:29.658
We went out a few times a while
back.

27:29.693 --> 27:32.928
One night I was hanging at the bar after
hours, waiting to meet her for a dirty one.

27:32.961 --> 27:34.897
- Eww.
- Martini, you perv.

27:34.930 --> 27:36.532
Oh!

27:36.565 --> 27:39.868
Anyway, one of the bartenders just so
happened to be a very handsome young lady.

27:40.402 --> 27:42.604
She got an olive lodged in her
throat.

27:42.638 --> 27:43.672
Everyone starts freaking out.

27:43.707 --> 27:46.075
I hop over the bar and
start giving her the Heimlich,

27:46.108 --> 27:48.143
but Kelly wasn't
familiar with that maneuver.

27:48.177 --> 27:49.378
So, it looked like we were...

27:49.411 --> 27:51.013
Ah, doinking.

27:51.046 --> 27:52.147
Doinking.

27:52.181 --> 27:53.849
That was it between
Kelly and I.

27:54.483 --> 27:56.218
I've been trying
to get her back ever since.

27:56.251 --> 27:58.654
- How's that going?
- I'm not good enough for her.

27:58.688 --> 28:01.323
Well, if you don't think you're
good enough, why should she?

28:04.126 --> 28:05.994
Maybe you should be the one
holding a conference.

28:16.405 --> 28:20.342
Do you like this? I just want to make sure
I look cute at the after party tonight.

28:21.243 --> 28:22.578
Yeah, you look cute.

28:32.521 --> 28:33.389
What about this one?

28:35.624 --> 28:39.261
It's great. They're both... I
like them both, you know.

28:39.294 --> 28:40.596
So, I will see you tonight?

28:40.629 --> 28:41.597
Uh-huh.

28:41.630 --> 28:43.298
Go ahead and buy that ticket.

28:44.233 --> 28:46.301
Oh, yeah. I'll just... I'll do it
when I get downstairs.

28:47.035 --> 28:47.970
Ah...

28:49.671 --> 28:54.243
Ah, you don't know how to
give massages, do you?

28:55.144 --> 29:00.015
Yes, I do. I was captain of the
varsity massage... massage squad.

29:00.048 --> 29:02.017
I have an idea. Come on.

29:07.356 --> 29:10.225
- Can you believe that guy?
- Okay, he's a complete slime ball, right?

29:10.259 --> 29:12.060
Oh, yeah. No question. I
mean it's a huge scam.

29:12.094 --> 29:13.128
You know him?

29:13.162 --> 29:15.197
Not personally. And this
Spirifresh thing is new.

29:15.230 --> 29:17.199
It used
to be called Modern Divinity.

29:17.232 --> 29:18.701
See, my aunt and uncle were
super into it,

29:18.735 --> 29:20.703
they put up their
house, all their savings,

29:20.737 --> 29:23.172
my uncle's foreign feather
collection, everything.

29:23.205 --> 29:25.307
They lost it all thinking he was
going to make them rich.

29:25.340 --> 29:28.944
Now they don't even have a feather to their
name. And those girls are in on it too.

29:29.679 --> 29:31.447
Help keep an eye on the
guys for me, would you?

29:31.480 --> 29:33.649
- But I hurt my wrist, Steve.
- God damn it.

29:40.322 --> 29:43.492
I'll sit in the hot bath and you
can massage my neck

29:43.525 --> 29:49.298
and then I'll figure out a way to pay you
back that's equally, physically gratifying.

29:51.366 --> 29:54.236
Careful, you might get wet.

29:55.604 --> 29:56.605
Not a problem.

29:59.274 --> 30:03.479
Ooh, clean your hands
first. Okay, sweetie?

30:03.512 --> 30:04.580
Of course.

30:16.492 --> 30:20.662
Oh, go ahead and
buy that ticket, okay, honey?

30:20.697 --> 30:22.564
Yes, of course.

30:31.808 --> 30:33.075
<i>Spirifresh.</i>

30:34.744 --> 30:35.544
All bought.

30:35.577 --> 30:38.547
Do you know what
I'm gonna do now?

30:40.449 --> 30:41.350
Nope.

30:41.383 --> 30:44.653
I'm going to take a
moment to get ready.

30:44.687 --> 30:47.155
Oh...

30:50.192 --> 30:51.794
Oh, right.

30:51.828 --> 30:54.463
Well, I'll be right outside

30:54.496 --> 30:58.333
whenever you're ready to...

31:00.435 --> 31:02.237
You're so cute.

31:12.314 --> 31:15.685
So, my vacation days expire at
the end of the month.

31:15.718 --> 31:19.588
I'm thinking about going to
Botswana, help build a school.

31:19.621 --> 31:24.159
I just hope one of the babies is an orphan,
so I can sneak him home in my suitcase.

31:24.192 --> 31:25.561
Well, why don't you just adopt?

31:25.594 --> 31:29.732
Oh, no, no, the chances of getting
a white baby are way too high.

31:31.199 --> 31:33.435
I love white babies.
I used to be one.

31:34.704 --> 31:36.238
Sorry, didn't see you guys
there.

31:36.271 --> 31:39.241
It's been a crazy day. Michael has me
taking care of a bunch of things for him,

31:39.274 --> 31:40.877
you know, assistant manager
type of stuff.

31:40.910 --> 31:42.544
Well, looks like you're just...

31:42.578 --> 31:45.547
One second, hold that thought.
That's a go for Steve.

31:45.581 --> 31:46.816
Yeah, we can move forward.

31:46.849 --> 31:50.753
Ultimately, it is my decision to
make, so we're good to go there.

31:50.787 --> 31:52.254
Great. Over.

31:53.422 --> 31:55.123
It's part of my day-to-day now.

31:55.157 --> 31:57.727
Just making decisions,
delegating,

31:57.760 --> 32:00.295
trying to figure out what to do
with my significant pay raise.

32:00.329 --> 32:01.463
How much you're making?

32:01.496 --> 32:03.900
You never ask a woman her age,
Catherine.

32:03.933 --> 32:05.868
You should know
that, seeing as how old you are.

32:05.902 --> 32:07.737
Why don't you just keep begging
for tips,

32:07.770 --> 32:10.572
maybe you can buy some tassles
for your handle bars.

32:10.606 --> 32:13.408
What was it like giving hand
jobs during the Great Depression?

32:13.442 --> 32:18.313
Kelly, um, what are you...
what are you doing later?

32:18.347 --> 32:20.115
I'm going to dinner
with Mr. Whitman.

32:20.683 --> 32:22.085
I'm actually at that dinner.

32:22.117 --> 32:26.355
So that's... that'll be you,
me and Mr. Whitman and all the managers.

32:26.388 --> 32:28.791
Probably, Alan too,
which will be great.

32:28.825 --> 32:30.392
I'll see you then.

32:30.425 --> 32:32.394
Oh, never stops. Sorry.

32:32.427 --> 32:34.864
That's a go for
Steve. Yeah, no.

32:34.897 --> 32:37.432
Let's go ahead
and hire that woman.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.601
She is great for the job.

32:39.635 --> 32:40.937
And let's... let's fire that kid.

32:40.970 --> 32:42.537
Okay, over.

32:43.305 --> 32:44.406
Guys, I would love to stay and
party,

32:44.439 --> 32:47.910
but this hotel is not going to
assistant manage itself.

32:47.944 --> 32:51.881
- So, I'll see you guys.
- Woah, who is assistant managing itself?

32:51.914 --> 32:54.616
Steve is. Didn't you hear?

32:55.450 --> 32:56.485
Is this true, Steven?

32:57.319 --> 33:00.656
Yeah, yup that's what... yup.

33:00.690 --> 33:01.991
Why wasn't I briefed on this?

33:02.025 --> 33:04.694
That sounds like an Alan problem,
not really a Steve problem.

33:04.727 --> 33:07.596
<i>This is Ops for Alan.
We need you to bring in the robes.</i>

33:07.629 --> 33:09.766
<i>We simply don't have the man
power down here.</i>

33:10.833 --> 33:12.735
Copy that. I'll
start collecting them.

33:12.769 --> 33:15.772
This conversation
will be continued.

33:16.405 --> 33:17.372
I look forward to it.

33:17.940 --> 33:18.708
Yeah.

33:18.741 --> 33:21.711
One demerit.

33:22.679 --> 33:24.212
It was nice
chatting with you, Kelly.

33:33.890 --> 33:38.861
Left, right. One, two. One,
two. One, two.

33:38.895 --> 33:40.797
Now jab up.

33:40.830 --> 33:43.700
See you tonight, sweetie. Make
sure your hands are clean.

33:47.970 --> 33:50.338
Oh, they are definitely into us.

33:50.372 --> 33:52.942
Yeah, and there is absolutely
nothing creepy about that.

33:52.975 --> 33:54.010
No, no.

34:11.460 --> 34:14.663
Hey, you about ready
for that massage?

34:15.664 --> 34:18.500
Oh, honey. I'm not feeling well.

34:19.333 --> 34:20.235
Okay.

34:21.636 --> 34:23.505
I can make you feel better.

34:23.538 --> 34:25.875
I'll see you tonight,
and we can do the massage then.

34:26.574 --> 34:27.844
Are you sure?

34:27.877 --> 34:30.847
Because you're here and I'm here
and the bath is already drawn.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.750
I'm definitely sure. I'd
like you to leave now.

34:35.650 --> 34:36.518
Okay.

34:48.330 --> 34:51.600
Hey, Sarah, it's Brad.

34:53.034 --> 34:55.504
I... um,
my clothes are in there.

34:55.536 --> 34:58.975
So, I'm going to need my clothes
and... oh, and my cellphone.

34:59.008 --> 35:00.743
My cellphone is in there.

35:12.521 --> 35:14.322
B.I.T. There's a call for you.

35:22.098 --> 35:24.834
- This one?
- Yeah. Pick it up.

35:26.501 --> 35:29.806
B.I.... Shit. Josh speaking.

35:29.839 --> 35:33.009
Josh, there's a horse
in the stable.

35:33.042 --> 35:34.010
What?

35:34.043 --> 35:36.045
Agamemnon is stuck in Troy.

35:37.113 --> 35:37.914
Okay.

35:37.947 --> 35:41.650
I need your help.
Trojan Suitcase.

35:42.584 --> 35:43.618
What?

35:43.652 --> 35:46.521
Read your handbook, Chapter
13. I'm in room 1312.

35:49.658 --> 35:50.525
Thank you.

36:02.104 --> 36:03.306
Shit.

36:03.338 --> 36:05.808
You know, for the first time
ever, I can finally taste life.

36:06.843 --> 36:08.144
Hey.

36:08.177 --> 36:09.879
- Hi.
- You guys all right?

36:09.912 --> 36:14.016
More than all right. Gunther
said I had what it takes.

36:14.050 --> 36:15.483
To do what?

36:15.517 --> 36:17.053
I'll find out tonight.

36:18.821 --> 36:19.621
What about you?

36:19.654 --> 36:20.823
Did you know that 75% of humans
beings

36:20.857 --> 36:23.658
don't know the difference
between ratios and percentages?

36:23.693 --> 36:24.827
I don't see how
that's important.

36:24.861 --> 36:29.932
If you came tonight, you would
know why it is important.

36:29.966 --> 36:30.833
Ah.

36:32.367 --> 36:35.104
Did you know 100% of people who pay
for things impulsively are dum-dums?

36:35.137 --> 36:37.139
Did you know that I 100%
believe in you?

36:54.924 --> 36:55.791
Excuse me.

36:59.028 --> 37:01.931
- B.I.T.
- Damn!

37:21.951 --> 37:24.020
- What took you so long?
- I couldn't find Kevin.

37:24.053 --> 37:28.925
Kevin is where Kevin always is,
next to Anteaus, Artmeis, and Leroy.

37:28.958 --> 37:32.728
I found him eventually, but then Leroy made me
answer three riddles. It was a whole thing.

37:32.762 --> 37:35.164
Hey, that's Leroy's job.

37:35.197 --> 37:36.899
Why are you wearing a bikini?

37:36.933 --> 37:39.601
Because I don't have my clothes

37:39.634 --> 37:43.505
and for some reason there are
no robes in this room.

37:44.606 --> 37:46.943
But why are you wearing the top?

37:46.976 --> 37:48.077
It's spring.

37:49.078 --> 37:50.179
What's going on in there?

37:50.212 --> 37:54.817
Nothing. Well, I was trying to
hook up with this girl.

37:54.850 --> 37:56.152
It was going really well, right.

37:56.185 --> 37:58.020
She was giving me like all the
signs, you know,

37:58.054 --> 38:00.189
and then she was like,
"Yeah." And I was like, "What?"

38:00.222 --> 38:02.191
I was like, "Yeah."
And she was like, "No."

38:02.224 --> 38:03.960
I went, "What? Because you
just said yeah."

38:03.993 --> 38:05.962
Anyway, hashtag respect,
so I hung out here.

38:05.995 --> 38:08.097
And I realized I left my
clothes in there and I was like,

38:08.130 --> 38:10.199
"I'll come out because
there's probably robes here."

38:10.232 --> 38:13.568
But there were no robes
in this room.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.108
It's one of those
Spirifresh girls?

38:21.277 --> 38:22.945
I don't know where she works.

38:23.679 --> 38:25.948
But I'm guessing it's probably
one of those Spirifresh girls.

38:27.917 --> 38:29.517
Okay, hop in. Let's
get you out of here.

38:29.551 --> 38:31.854
Woah, woah, woah. Back up.

38:32.321 --> 38:33.923
This isn't my first rodeo.

38:35.791 --> 38:38.127
If only I hadn't pulled slime in
the real <i>Ghostbusters </i>,

38:38.160 --> 38:40.229
I wouldn't be going into another
Trojan suitcase.

38:45.034 --> 38:47.103
- Hi, Alan.
- Joshua.

38:47.136 --> 38:49.105
You can just call me Josh.

38:49.138 --> 38:50.873
That's what I said. Joshua.

38:51.639 --> 38:53.209
What's with the robes?

38:53.242 --> 38:55.845
I'm removing them from all the rooms until
we find out who's been stealing them.

38:55.878 --> 38:57.847
What was that?

38:58.881 --> 38:59.782
I sneezed.

38:59.815 --> 39:01.117
It sounded muffled.

39:01.917 --> 39:03.219
My sneezes are muffled.

39:03.252 --> 39:04.286
Why?

39:06.654 --> 39:09.792
Deviated nose job.

39:10.292 --> 39:11.293
Hmm.

39:20.736 --> 39:22.138
- Oh.
- Ah!

39:22.171 --> 39:25.640
Oh, hi! Here. Okay.

39:26.876 --> 39:28.576
I'll take that, sir.

39:31.313 --> 39:34.884
Okay. Oh, you're gonna take that
for me. Thank you so much.

39:35.384 --> 39:37.086
Is there anything else
we can do for you?

39:37.119 --> 39:39.088
No, I'm actually off to see the
concierge.

39:39.121 --> 39:43.059
I was going to arrange a tour of
your local lettuce facilities.

39:43.092 --> 39:44.693
Excellent choice.

39:44.727 --> 39:47.830
Yes. I will see you later.

39:54.904 --> 39:57.840
Okay, okay. Enjoy.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.015
Joshua.

40:07.349 --> 40:09.919
I think this is going
to have a profound impact.

40:09.952 --> 40:12.054
You got to be kidding me.
What the hell is this?

40:12.088 --> 40:13.989
We wanted to give our guests a
chance to join

40:14.023 --> 40:16.658
just in case they're yet not aware
of the wonders of Spirifresh.

40:16.692 --> 40:18.360
Gunther says we'll get
a cut of each one sold.

40:18.394 --> 40:19.962
You mean like a pyramid scheme?

40:19.995 --> 40:22.832
Not cash, my gentle warrior. A
percentage of our soul.

40:22.865 --> 40:23.833
That's much less crazy.

40:25.768 --> 40:28.170
- Josh, what the shit is this?
- Trojan Suitcase.

40:28.204 --> 40:30.339
I can see that. What are
you doing with it?

40:30.372 --> 40:32.708
Did you authorize a B.I.T. to
execute a Trojan, yes?

40:32.741 --> 40:35.044
Shut your mouth. I did not.
I'm just learning of this.

40:35.077 --> 40:36.879
It has to be approved by a bell
captain.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.781
I would never have allowed it.
Too much risk.

40:38.814 --> 40:40.216
I'm sorry, Steve.
No one was around.

40:41.550 --> 40:44.652
Josh, will you get me out
of here so I can meet Tony Danza?

40:44.687 --> 40:46.922
Just get Brad to safety so he
can change.

40:46.956 --> 40:48.991
It's almost time for afternoon
check-ins.

40:50.993 --> 40:52.194
Faster, Josh.

40:52.228 --> 40:54.763
- I'm trying.
- You move so weird.

40:56.198 --> 40:59.435
- You guys are really in deep...
- Hello, Steven. Have you seen Joshua?

40:59.468 --> 41:00.903
I have some items I
need to discuss with him.

41:00.936 --> 41:05.808
Alan, you know what? Josh just went on
break. Anything I can help you with?

41:05.841 --> 41:08.177
Currently no. It's
Joshua I need.

41:09.245 --> 41:10.846
Revised check-in list is here.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.047
Thank you so much, Stacey.

41:13.682 --> 41:17.086
Alan, we really need to attend to our bell
duties. Priorities, you understand that?

41:17.820 --> 41:20.089
Maybe we can reconvene
in an hour or so?

41:20.122 --> 41:23.025
Yes, of course. As you were.

41:35.771 --> 41:38.807
Oh, thank God! I could barely
breathe in there.

41:38.841 --> 41:41.210
I'm sorry about that, Brad.
Where are the extra uniforms?

41:45.281 --> 41:48.851
Wait, why didn't you just have
me bring you a uniform?

41:48.884 --> 41:50.419
- Because it's spring.
- Yeah.

41:51.253 --> 41:52.721
Here you go.

41:54.490 --> 41:55.791
Hey, Josh.

41:57.226 --> 41:58.827
You killed it today.

42:05.501 --> 42:06.802
What?

42:07.970 --> 42:08.971
I like it.

42:10.339 --> 42:14.243
Me too, Leroy. Me too.

42:14.276 --> 42:16.278
- <i>Come on down, Kelly.</i>
- No, Patty. Patty.

42:16.312 --> 42:18.814
- <i>Don't think...</i>
- Patty, I need you to take this seriously.

42:18.847 --> 42:20.316
- <i>Shut up.</i>
- Bye.

42:20.349 --> 42:21.483
- Hello!
- Oh!

42:22.952 --> 42:23.886
Hello.

42:25.487 --> 42:28.757
- Go ahead.
- Okay. Can I help you?

42:29.892 --> 42:31.427
What even is this?

42:32.494 --> 42:33.929
Help.

42:33.963 --> 42:35.764
What is help?

42:35.798 --> 42:40.369
I have noticed something
about you when we met before.

42:40.402 --> 42:42.071
I'm sorry, we met before?

42:42.104 --> 42:43.339
It was not in this life.

42:43.372 --> 42:47.176
It was on another planet called
Maple First.

42:47.810 --> 42:50.346
It looks exactly like
Earth. You can't even tell.

42:50.379 --> 42:52.348
It's the same carpet on the
wall, everything.

42:52.381 --> 42:54.883
But it does not have
the restraints

42:54.917 --> 42:58.554
of man and woman.

43:04.927 --> 43:07.463
Is there something I
can help you with?

43:07.496 --> 43:09.498
It's clear you have questions.

43:09.531 --> 43:12.101
I clearly have answers.

43:12.601 --> 43:14.403
Do you
feel my foot on your foot?

43:14.436 --> 43:15.604
That's not me.

43:15.638 --> 43:18.107
There's something under the
table that feels like a foot.

43:18.140 --> 43:20.009
Kelly, look.

43:20.943 --> 43:23.946
You need to come tonight.

43:25.481 --> 43:27.349
I'm not sure that I can.

43:30.319 --> 43:32.121
What's fun to do in the area?

43:33.455 --> 43:34.623
Would you like a brochure?

43:34.657 --> 43:39.228
Yeah, yeah. For sure, yeah.
This is kind of why I came.

43:48.971 --> 43:51.373
All right, kid. You
ready for check-ins?

43:53.409 --> 43:54.510
I was born...

43:56.378 --> 43:57.246
Ready.

43:58.782 --> 44:01.150
I think he was going to say, "I was
born ready." But I think I punched him.

44:03.285 --> 44:06.221
Congratulations, your future
husband is a very lucky man.

44:07.122 --> 44:09.491
I'm not going to cheat
on him with you.

44:10.125 --> 44:12.628
Oh, no, no, no, no. I... I didn't
mean that. I have a girlfriend.

44:12.661 --> 44:15.998
So, I'm... I'm happy there in
that capacity.

44:16.031 --> 44:17.433
You don't think I'm pretty?

44:20.669 --> 44:24.039
I don't want to go
inside the hotel.

44:24.073 --> 44:26.075
Pick a card, any card.

44:26.108 --> 44:27.609
But that's a bird.

44:27.643 --> 44:29.178
Magic.

44:39.254 --> 44:41.090
- We want ice-cream.
- We want ice-cream.

44:41.123 --> 44:42.624
- We want ice-cream.
- We want ice-cream.

44:42.658 --> 44:44.226
- We want ice-cream.
- We want ice-cream.

44:44.259 --> 44:47.429
I don't usually do this, but I'm going
to give you some free financial advice.

44:47.463 --> 44:49.131
Oh, yeah. Apple, Amazon?

44:49.164 --> 44:52.034
No, that's the past. You want
to buy polyurethane.

44:52.067 --> 44:53.202
Like plastics?

44:53.235 --> 44:55.304
No, like sex dolls. We all
need them.

44:57.439 --> 44:59.108
Or Wahlburgers.

45:01.176 --> 45:03.145
Sir, I'm gonna help you
with that. Toss me that.

45:11.153 --> 45:12.521
Hey, get back here.

45:21.397 --> 45:22.498
<i>Bravo!</i>

45:25.200 --> 45:26.268
Check-in's this way.

45:39.148 --> 45:40.082
Josh.

45:41.583 --> 45:44.353
You engaged in a Trojan suitcase
without approval of your bell captain.

45:44.386 --> 45:46.488
But due to the circumstances,

45:46.522 --> 45:48.257
I will approve it
postquam factum.

45:48.290 --> 45:50.693
Congratulations, you've passed
the second stage.

45:51.694 --> 45:54.163
Hey, hey. Congrats on passing
stage two, Josh.

45:54.196 --> 45:55.698
Aw, thanks guys.

45:57.700 --> 46:00.068
Dude, this is for the Brennan's
birthday party.

46:04.473 --> 46:06.275
I'm sorry.

46:06.308 --> 46:07.976
Those are Make-a-Wish kids.

46:08.010 --> 46:10.412
They had one wish. Cake.

46:29.565 --> 46:30.499
What now?

46:30.532 --> 46:32.134
I need to be at that dinner
with Whitman.

46:32.167 --> 46:33.770
- Why?
- Because I lied to Kelly again.

46:33.803 --> 46:35.204
What? Why would you...

46:36.472 --> 46:38.307
You're really putting me in a
bad spot here.

46:38.340 --> 46:40.509
- Mr. Whitman's going to be here any minute.
- Yeah, I know.

46:41.376 --> 46:43.979
I will talk to Susan. Stop
lying to people!

46:48.685 --> 46:50.118
We can party in my
yacht tomorrow.

46:53.155 --> 46:54.323
Here he comes.

46:55.157 --> 46:56.191
Steve, hey Steve.

46:56.225 --> 46:58.327
We crushed this afternoon rush
and we were thinking,

46:58.360 --> 47:00.429
can we clock out
early for Spirifresh?

47:00.462 --> 47:01.731
Are you sure you want to?
He's...

47:01.764 --> 47:04.099
<i>I've
never been more sure in my life.</i>

47:04.132 --> 47:06.435
Let me go talk to Brad
for a minute. Cool?

47:06.468 --> 47:08.504
- Yeah. Cool. Awesome.
- Thank you. Steve, thank you.

47:08.537 --> 47:09.404
Not here.

47:26.789 --> 47:27.656
Hey, man.

47:29.091 --> 47:30.092
Thanks for coming.

47:31.093 --> 47:32.094
I need to come clean.

47:33.730 --> 47:34.663
And I trust you.

47:36.431 --> 47:37.767
I'm trying to get a promotion.

47:39.535 --> 47:41.436
I know. I don't like
it happening this way,

47:42.604 --> 47:44.306
but it's my only shot of getting
Kelly back.

47:44.841 --> 47:49.111
Have you tried like telling her
how you feel? Being honest?

47:49.144 --> 47:51.613
Wow. What is it, 1958?

47:52.414 --> 47:56.652
Look, this is what's happening,
and I just need your support.

47:56.686 --> 47:57.553
It's fine, Steve.

47:58.420 --> 47:59.856
It's your life.
You call the shots.

47:59.889 --> 48:03.258
We're just the bellmen helping bring
bags to the little hotel in your brain.

48:03.760 --> 48:04.660
That's not true.

48:06.495 --> 48:07.797
You guys are
more than just bellmen.

48:07.830 --> 48:08.698
Hey!

48:09.699 --> 48:10.666
So are you!

48:11.868 --> 48:13.602
If you think getting promoted
will help you get the girl,

48:14.837 --> 48:16.371
then you go for it.

48:17.205 --> 48:19.274
Whatever you do, just know
that we have your back.

48:20.142 --> 48:22.177
Just make sure it's the right
decision.

48:24.346 --> 48:25.247
Thank you, brother.

48:25.748 --> 48:28.751
Thank you for being honest.

48:28.785 --> 48:29.752
Yeah.

48:39.261 --> 48:41.463
I'm gonna go check on JJ and
Tyler. I'm worried about them.

48:41.496 --> 48:43.165
Yeah, I got to finish up here.

48:43.198 --> 48:45.367
- We both got stuff to do.
- Yeah, all right. All right.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.836
- See you back at the...
- At the hotel.

48:46.869 --> 48:47.770
- Where we work.
- Yeah.

48:47.804 --> 48:49.806
If not, I'll text you
later. Same number?

48:49.839 --> 48:51.273
- Good to see you, Brad.
- You too.

48:51.306 --> 48:52.809
Lot of sun screen. I like that.

48:58.513 --> 48:59.816
Oh, you like that?

49:05.888 --> 49:08.590
- Can you untie me now?
- Did you learn your lesson?

49:08.624 --> 49:11.460
- Yeah.
- You're going to do a Trojan ass without an official A?

49:11.493 --> 49:15.530
Yeah. No. No. No. God, no. Absolutely not.
I've learned. I've learned.

49:16.264 --> 49:17.132
Good.

49:21.804 --> 49:22.671
Brad.

49:23.672 --> 49:24.841
Brad. Are you gonna untie me?

49:26.408 --> 49:27.275
Brad.

49:28.745 --> 49:32.147
Um, hello?

49:32.648 --> 49:35.217
Guys. Hey, guys?

49:37.586 --> 49:38.420
Guys.

49:38.453 --> 49:40.757
Okay, I'm only going
to do this once,

49:41.423 --> 49:42.725
because right now my
consciousness

49:42.759 --> 49:44.727
is being violently penetrated by
wisdom genitals.

49:45.527 --> 49:47.930
Okay. Well, I'm heading out.

49:47.964 --> 49:51.533
Just wanted to let you know
Mr. Whitman is arriving soon.

49:51.566 --> 49:54.469
Susan asked to make sure someone
was there to greet him.

49:54.503 --> 49:59.207
Well, I think Mr. Whitman needs to greet
himself first, if you know what mean.

50:00.409 --> 50:01.978
Just don't piss him off.

50:02.011 --> 50:03.880
Or Susan, I guess.

50:03.913 --> 50:05.580
Whatever. You
guys are weird.

50:07.382 --> 50:09.752
- <i>Adios</i>, Santiago.
- <i>Adios,</i> Stacey. Have a wonderful evening.

50:09.786 --> 50:11.253
Goodnight, Stacey.

50:11.286 --> 50:13.388
Steven. I need to speak to you.

50:13.422 --> 50:15.590
Ah, what's up Alan?

50:15.624 --> 50:18.460
I examined the employee log in
human resources

50:18.493 --> 50:21.630
and there's no information about
your pending promotion.

50:21.663 --> 50:23.066
Oh, yeah.

50:23.099 --> 50:26.234
It happened super last minute, so,
probably hasn't been updated yet.

50:26.869 --> 50:32.674
I checked with payroll and there's no start
paperwork submitted for the wage increase.

50:32.709 --> 50:34.744
I actually agreed to maintain my
bellman rate

50:34.777 --> 50:37.880
until I have sufficiently trained
our newest bellman hire, Josh.

50:37.914 --> 50:42.317
- Whom you've met.
- Yes, Joshua, met I have.

50:42.350 --> 50:43.152
Great.

50:43.186 --> 50:46.321
But there's a different
insurance

50:46.354 --> 50:47.656
which covers management

50:47.690 --> 50:52.829
and the paperwork for that
hasn't been submitted yet either.

50:52.862 --> 50:54.329
Well, yes.

50:54.362 --> 50:59.601
That's because since we've employed
the new cashless tipping app, Bravo,

51:00.302 --> 51:04.406
we also implemented a new
paperless paper app

51:05.407 --> 51:08.343
called Paper.

51:08.376 --> 51:09.812
That can't be,

51:09.846 --> 51:13.015
I would know if there was some new
app that we were supposed to have...

51:13.049 --> 51:16.953
It's brand new, super new.
Literally just happened.

51:16.986 --> 51:19.421
Like we
guys were talking about it.

51:19.454 --> 51:20.823
It's getting launched.

51:20.857 --> 51:23.525
I just got a text about it in
the old palm pilot.

51:23.558 --> 51:25.795
So, you know, so that's that.

51:25.828 --> 51:27.196
You know what, Alan?

51:27.230 --> 51:30.900
This seems like there's still a lot
of information to be picked up on.

51:30.933 --> 51:32.702
So, I'm gonna talk...

51:32.735 --> 51:36.438
I'm going to go find... to Brad
about...

51:36.471 --> 51:38.573
What would Brad know?
He's just a common bellman.

51:38.607 --> 51:40.642
- Oh, wow.
- Alan, how dare you?

51:40.676 --> 51:43.445
- I'm right here.
- Brad is one of our top employees,

51:43.478 --> 51:45.715
and actually probably in line
to replace me as bell captain.

51:45.748 --> 51:48.316
- Really?
- You know what? Yeah, I think so.

51:48.350 --> 51:49.618
When my promotion is
complete.

51:49.651 --> 51:52.722
- Congratulations again on your promotion.
- Thank you so much.

51:52.755 --> 51:54.891
I'm going to go talk to Susan.

51:54.924 --> 51:56.692
Great. Tell her I said hi.

51:56.726 --> 51:57.994
Tell her we said what up.

52:00.428 --> 52:03.565
I'm sorry, I got stuck, all
right. These guys are worthless.

52:03.598 --> 52:08.971
Worth is only measured less by the man who
values less worth than what he's actually worth.

52:09.005 --> 52:14.744
Thus, worthlessness cannot be worth
less than what it is, worthless.

52:16.946 --> 52:19.715
Okay. If Alan talks to Susan,
he's going to know there's no promotion.

52:19.749 --> 52:20.817
And we're gonna be screwed.

52:24.987 --> 52:26.454
What are you doing?

52:26.488 --> 52:28.891
<i>This is Ops, for Alan.</i>

52:30.425 --> 52:32.128
Okay, go for Alan.

52:32.161 --> 52:33.528
Hey, man.

52:33.562 --> 52:37.599
We have an emergency situation on
our hands and I need help, ASAP.

52:37.632 --> 52:39.969
One of the guests is...

52:42.038 --> 52:45.007
...molesting a saguaro.

52:45.975 --> 52:46.909
What?

52:46.943 --> 52:49.477
Yeah, man. We need a manager to
go down there

52:49.511 --> 52:53.015
and sort of oversee the
proceedings, and you know.

52:53.916 --> 52:55.650
Can't Michael handle it?

52:55.685 --> 52:59.454
Are you kidding me, man? Michael
is decapitated.

52:59.487 --> 53:00.488
What about Steven?

53:00.522 --> 53:04.026
Steven! Are you kidding me? That
guy is a boner.

53:04.060 --> 53:06.494
I can't have a
boner go down there.

53:06.528 --> 53:08.965
Are you not listening to me?
Is this thing on?

53:08.998 --> 53:11.934
I need you and your big balls.

53:12.902 --> 53:13.803
Come again?

53:13.836 --> 53:15.503
Smart calls.

53:17.639 --> 53:20.076
Okay, I understand.

53:20.109 --> 53:21.811
<i>Where do you need me?</i>

53:23.846 --> 53:24.814
- What...
- Say something.

53:24.847 --> 53:28.617
- What?
- Where is the saguaro being molested?

53:30.019 --> 53:31.721
Twelfth hole, pal.

53:33.856 --> 53:35.423
The golf course?

53:35.457 --> 53:40.029
Yes, the golf course. What other holes do
we have around here? Don't answer that.

53:40.062 --> 53:43.866
Okay, copy that. I'm on my way.

54:01.784 --> 54:04.153
It's the boss. Ha-ha,
you're finally here.

54:04.186 --> 54:05.721
Tigron, how are you?

54:05.755 --> 54:09.091
Very good. Very good. Don't worry.
We will take very good care of your car.

54:09.125 --> 54:11.559
Tigron, this isn't just a car.

54:12.161 --> 54:15.530
This is the most magnificent
thing I've ever put my ass in.

54:15.563 --> 54:18.500
If you ask it nicely, it'll make
coffee for you.

54:18.533 --> 54:21.070
Press drive, take a nap.
Go for a spin.

54:21.103 --> 54:24.040
This thing is so smart, it could
raise my children if I asked it to.

54:24.073 --> 54:27.143
I have extra baby just so
vehicle can raise it.

54:28.144 --> 54:29.511
How's your brother, Davit?

54:29.544 --> 54:32.580
I am excellent, sir,
just excellent.

54:32.614 --> 54:35.718
Ah, Davit. Good to see you. All
right, let me see.

54:36.118 --> 54:37.787
That's 25 bucks for you.

54:37.820 --> 54:40.022
- Thank you.
- 25 dollars for you.

54:40.056 --> 54:42.858
And do me a favor,
take it easy on the bellmen, would you?

54:44.659 --> 54:46.561
I'd rather have
khachkar melt my balls.

54:47.662 --> 54:49.564
I understand. Take care, boys.

54:51.067 --> 54:52.201
Davit, get in the car.

54:56.138 --> 54:57.340
Hello...

54:57.373 --> 54:59.842
Susan, there's something urgent
I need to discuss with you.

54:59.875 --> 55:01.077
Not urgent. Sid now. Sid now.

55:01.110 --> 55:04.814
Hey, there they are! The best
management team in the business.

55:04.847 --> 55:09.852
How are you guys? Oh, I've been
away for so long I missed you guys.

55:09.885 --> 55:10.987
Welcome back, Sid.

55:11.020 --> 55:13.889
- Where's Alan?
- He's probably held up with a guest.

55:13.923 --> 55:15.590
- Okay.
- Mr. Whitman.

55:15.623 --> 55:18.560
Really? You insult me like this?

55:18.593 --> 55:21.529
How many times have I told you?
You don't call me Mr. Whitman.

55:21.563 --> 55:24.566
You call me Sid. You understand
me? Call me Sid.

55:24.599 --> 55:26.235
- Yes, Mr. Whitman.
- Much better.

55:26.268 --> 55:28.237
- Can I take your bag?
- No. It's mine.

55:32.274 --> 55:34.977
I don't know it crosses, it
crosses. Oh, you forgot.

55:35.011 --> 55:36.245
Good to see you, buddy.

55:47.790 --> 55:48.791
Hello.

55:53.095 --> 55:54.130
You there.

55:54.830 --> 55:55.965
Are you okay?

55:57.333 --> 55:59.702
Have you been attacked?

56:00.836 --> 56:02.071
Do you need an adult?

56:03.372 --> 56:05.307
Did you see the incident?

56:11.113 --> 56:12.948
Alan for Operations.

56:12.982 --> 56:14.150
<i>Go for Ops.</i>

56:14.183 --> 56:16.052
I'm at the 12th hole.

56:16.085 --> 56:17.153
Mazel tov.

56:18.054 --> 56:19.989
Where is the molested saguaro?

56:20.689 --> 56:22.091
<i>I'm not sure what you mean, sir.</i>

56:22.958 --> 56:26.328
You called me to tend to the
12th hole

56:26.362 --> 56:29.865
to diffuse a situation involving
a molested saguaro.

56:29.899 --> 56:33.668
<i>You weren't called by us, sir.</i>

56:34.669 --> 56:36.604
<i>Yo, they got Alan again!</i>

56:38.374 --> 56:39.607
Steven.

56:40.876 --> 56:42.044
Two demerits.

56:46.715 --> 56:48.751
Dinner is ready whenever
you'd like to eat.

56:48.784 --> 56:50.386
- Fantastic.
- Steve will join us as well.

56:50.419 --> 56:52.121
Oh. Well, why?

56:52.154 --> 56:55.758
I... I told him he could.
Plus, he's very hungry.

56:55.791 --> 56:58.861
- Hello, Mr. Whitman.
- The next person that calls me Mr. Whitman is out of here.

56:58.894 --> 57:00.628
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Whitman.

57:00.662 --> 57:01.363
Very good.

57:01.397 --> 57:02.898
That I like. Come here.

57:04.300 --> 57:07.336
Ah, it's good to see you.
And congratulations on that pin thingy.

57:07.369 --> 57:08.704
Thank you.

57:09.238 --> 57:10.439
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

57:10.473 --> 57:14.009
You know what, I'm going to
catch up with you guys in a bit.

57:14.043 --> 57:15.811
I got a few things to finish up
here, first.

57:15.845 --> 57:17.213
All right, let's go.

57:17.246 --> 57:18.347
Come on.

57:25.688 --> 57:27.056
I feel so joyous.

57:27.089 --> 57:28.157
Yes, yes.

57:31.127 --> 57:32.261
We're attending the conference.

57:32.294 --> 57:34.930
Gonna mess around and
change our lives completely.

57:34.964 --> 57:36.365
You guys did well today.

57:36.398 --> 57:38.400
No, we hit the ATM.

57:38.434 --> 57:42.004
Gunther likes to challenge his
disciples in the crowd

57:42.037 --> 57:45.407
and if you can outbid your neighbor
then you'll get a clue to the universe.

57:45.441 --> 57:47.343
Come, brother JJ, to
the conference

57:47.376 --> 57:51.013
and we will suckle from the tit of
perfection and life wondering wisdom.

57:51.046 --> 57:53.015
<i>Namaste.</i>
Now, I'm gonna go. You stay.

58:01.023 --> 58:02.391
How did you get free?

58:02.424 --> 58:03.993
Honestly, I don't know.

58:05.628 --> 58:10.299
I passed out from what I assume was lack
of blood circulation and dehydration. Both.

58:10.332 --> 58:12.234
I came to and I was free.

58:12.268 --> 58:15.471
I did see a big Native American
dude walking away.

58:15.504 --> 58:17.806
I tried calling out, but
everyone around here

58:17.840 --> 58:20.743
likes to dramatically walk away and not
answer when people call out to them.

58:22.311 --> 58:23.913
Wait, Brad.

58:24.747 --> 58:25.414
Josh?

58:29.485 --> 58:31.954
Head to room 3158, pronto.

58:31.987 --> 58:33.022
I'm trusting you.

58:33.756 --> 58:35.124
I'm sending
you to Gunther's room.

58:35.157 --> 58:37.927
I need you to find something,
anything that will help us take him down.

58:37.960 --> 58:39.228
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

58:41.163 --> 58:42.932
Wait, Steve.

59:16.565 --> 59:18.934
Welcome to Spirifresh.

59:23.839 --> 59:27.843
And now, the closest thing we
have to a god on Earth,

59:27.876 --> 59:30.512
the answer to all of our
problems,

59:31.380 --> 59:33.449
Gunther Gochamonet.

01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:14.089
Why does the mind

01:00:14.123 --> 01:00:18.327
always is trying to make the body
play hookey from your relevance?

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.295
I'm on my journey,

01:00:21.096 --> 01:00:23.332
I'm starting out this
way, yeah, but then I end up.

01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:31.874
I end up over here.
Why am I hookey?

01:00:31.907 --> 01:00:33.075
But tonight,

01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:39.081
I will teach you.

01:00:44.386 --> 01:00:46.355
If you're into a cherry
oak vibe,

01:00:46.388 --> 01:00:49.124
with an after taste not
unlike a Russian winter,

01:00:49.158 --> 01:00:51.560
- I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:51.593 --> 01:00:52.594
This is the Malbec?

01:00:52.628 --> 01:00:54.196
No, that's the tap water.

01:00:54.229 --> 01:00:56.632
Never push the tap water, kid.

01:00:56.665 --> 01:00:57.734
Of course.

01:00:57.767 --> 01:01:01.503
If I may say, you are as
handsome as you are funny.

01:01:01.537 --> 01:01:02.938
We only hire the finest.

01:01:02.971 --> 01:01:04.940
Well, then how the hell
did Alan get a job?

01:01:04.973 --> 01:01:07.142
Oh, Sid, he was a qualified
applicant.

01:01:07.176 --> 01:01:10.279
I'm kidding. I love Alan. You
know what I'm going to have?

01:01:10.312 --> 01:01:13.182
I'm going to have a Simmzy's
Beach Cruiser.

01:01:13.215 --> 01:01:16.652
Oh, two Simmzy's Beach
Cruisers. One for my pal, Steve.

01:01:16.686 --> 01:01:18.420
That is an excellent choice.

01:01:18.454 --> 01:01:22.124
Now, on the specials menu tonight
we have a Cornish Game Hen,

01:01:22.157 --> 01:01:26.528
Kentucky blue grass fed and raised with her
parents and half siblings in attendance.

01:01:26.562 --> 01:01:29.565
She was given a community
college education,

01:01:29.598 --> 01:01:31.467
but she spent her
winters at summer camp.

01:01:34.036 --> 01:01:35.204
Everything okay?

01:01:35.705 --> 01:01:38.974
Yeah, the Spirifresh thing is...

01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:41.443
I'm just trying to make sure
everything's okay.

01:01:41.477 --> 01:01:44.246
Well, I'm proud of you.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.615
Thank you. For what?

01:01:46.648 --> 01:01:50.486
Well, taking the initiative to
move up.

01:01:50.519 --> 01:01:52.321
It means a lot. It's a big deal.

01:01:53.055 --> 01:01:56.158
Just knowing that getting a
promotion matters, means something.

01:01:56.191 --> 01:01:57.359
It's half the battle.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.128
Exactly.

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:04.199
You don't need to do.
You need to just try.

01:02:04.233 --> 01:02:07.035
Get one shot. Lose myself in the
moment.

01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:09.905
Take my mom's spaghetti.
Baby, I'm a firework.

01:02:11.006 --> 01:02:12.941
Ain't
nobody gonna hold me down.

01:02:12.975 --> 01:02:15.978
Oh,
oh, I got to keep on moving.

01:02:16.011 --> 01:02:17.513
Backstreet's back all right.

01:02:17.546 --> 01:02:19.081
Something like that.

01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:20.516
We can talk
about it more after dinner.

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:22.384
Maybe for a dirty one?

01:02:23.686 --> 01:02:27.423
- I mean...
- You finished with your intimate moments? Proceed.

01:02:27.456 --> 01:02:30.225
Thank you. I don't want you to
take my word for it.

01:02:30.259 --> 01:02:34.196
When we say farm to table, we
mean farm to table.

01:02:35.765 --> 01:02:37.566
Wait till you see how
fresh the fish is.

01:02:39.201 --> 01:02:40.569
Okay, hold up. Hold up.

01:02:40.602 --> 01:02:42.739
So, you
mean to tell me that she was hot

01:02:42.772 --> 01:02:44.707
and then she wasn't hot and
then she was hot again?

01:02:44.741 --> 01:02:48.277
- Bro, it's the method.
- I love chicks too.

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:53.282
- I love pizza.
- Not as much as I love chicks. DKE.

01:03:21.143 --> 01:03:23.145
<i>You are walking.</i>

01:03:24.613 --> 01:03:25.748
You are walking on the cloud.

01:03:26.582 --> 01:03:31.286
And the cloud looks up to you
and says,

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.757
"Oh, hi. How's it going
up there? Yeah."

01:03:35.758 --> 01:03:37.359
And you reply...

01:03:37.392 --> 01:03:42.197
As long as I know who
I am, I am well.

01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:45.567
Yeah,

01:03:46.401 --> 01:03:47.269
yeah,

01:03:48.103 --> 01:03:49.104
yeah,

01:03:49.137 --> 01:03:50.005
yeah.

01:03:52.307 --> 01:03:55.344
Using
your sense of ears like a bear.

01:03:55.377 --> 01:03:58.614
With our minds
we begin to urinate

01:03:59.314 --> 01:04:02.651
and then for real into
our pants.

01:04:07.556 --> 01:04:10.592
We come to 18.
He hits an errand ball into the woods.

01:04:10.626 --> 01:04:12.427
We can't find it. I said,
you know what?

01:04:12.461 --> 01:04:15.130
Just drop a ball,
because I'm a good guy.

01:04:15.163 --> 01:04:19.067
Hits a tree, bounces out of
bounds, I win the hole.

01:04:19.101 --> 01:04:22.371
You know why?
Because I'm a good guy.

01:04:22.404 --> 01:04:24.273
And I'm here today

01:04:24.306 --> 01:04:29.344
because I'm a nice
guy with some very bad news.

01:04:29.378 --> 01:04:31.113
I'm selling the hotel.

01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:34.851
I was
approached by this big investor

01:04:34.884 --> 01:04:37.754
who has an in with the Indian
Reservation and Gaming Board

01:04:37.787 --> 01:04:40.522
and he wants to turn the place
into a casino and I...

01:04:40.556 --> 01:04:43.425
I don't qualify for that.
And I love this place.

01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:44.526
I love you guys,

01:04:45.494 --> 01:04:47.396
but it's hard to keep this place
profitable,

01:04:47.429 --> 01:04:49.766
and Samantha says she wants to
move to Florida.

01:04:49.799 --> 01:04:53.635
And when the
wife says "jump," you say,

01:04:54.636 --> 01:04:56.171
"Let's move to Florida."

01:04:56.706 --> 01:04:58.340
But our jobs are safe, right?

01:04:58.373 --> 01:05:00.609
See, this we don't know because
they're rebranding.

01:05:00.642 --> 01:05:04.646
They're gonna turn the conference
rooms into gaming tables, and slots.

01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:08.685
I don't know the details. I just
know that... Alan, you made it.

01:05:08.718 --> 01:05:12.722
Yes, I did. But I'm not the only
one who made it to the top

01:05:12.755 --> 01:05:14.891
of the ladder of lies.

01:05:14.924 --> 01:05:16.158
Alan, you look like hell.

01:05:16.191 --> 01:05:19.729
- Yeah, let's get you cleaned up.
- No, I'm not getting cleaned up.

01:05:19.762 --> 01:05:24.232
- You all need to know what's...
- Steve! I'm so sorry to interrupt.

01:05:24.266 --> 01:05:26.268
- Steve, I need to show you something.
- No!

01:05:26.803 --> 01:05:30.339
It's my turn to talk. Steve
has been lying to me.

01:05:30.372 --> 01:05:31.673
Lying to all of you.

01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:36.244
He is not the Assistant Front
Office Manager.

01:05:36.278 --> 01:05:38.848
He is a bell captain.
And that's it.

01:05:38.881 --> 01:05:41.283
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know, Susan.

01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:47.289
He has been impersonating a
manager, and that is a felony.

01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:49.224
I don't think that's a felony.

01:05:49.257 --> 01:05:50.425
Alan, you're very sweaty.

01:05:50.459 --> 01:05:54.797
He led me to believe that he was
up for a very specific job

01:05:54.831 --> 01:05:58.300
and then he was parading it all
around the hotel.

01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:02.371
There are liability issues,
ethics issues.

01:06:02.404 --> 01:06:03.873
He should be fired!

01:06:03.906 --> 01:06:07.142
Okay, all right. All right. Just
hold on. Just calm down.

01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:09.879
Stop the music.

01:06:11.513 --> 01:06:12.915
What the hell is
going on?

01:06:12.949 --> 01:06:17.854
I have proof that Gunther is using
Sanz Hand, Sanz Hand, Sanz Hands

01:06:17.887 --> 01:06:20.222
hand sanitizer
to brainwash his followers.

01:06:20.255 --> 01:06:21.323
Let me see that.

01:06:21.824 --> 01:06:23.558
You went into his room?

01:06:24.426 --> 01:06:26.662
You broke into a guest's room?

01:06:26.696 --> 01:06:27.897
I think that's a felony.

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:32.702
Well, yes but not because...

01:06:32.735 --> 01:06:34.202
I told him to.

01:06:35.705 --> 01:06:39.274
I was trying to prove that Gunther
is conning everyone with Spirifresh.

01:06:39.307 --> 01:06:40.642
Who the hell is Gunther?

01:06:43.946 --> 01:06:48.283
That's not Gunther, that's Chief Macanopy.
He's the guy who's buying the hotel from me.

01:06:48.316 --> 01:06:50.318
Who's Chief Macanopy?

01:06:50.352 --> 01:06:53.355
- This doesn't add up.
- You're selling the hotel?

01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:55.557
- Yes.
- Will we get to keep our jobs?

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.760
We don't know. They're rebranding.
We'll tell you later.

01:06:57.794 --> 01:06:59.261
We got to get to
that conference.

01:07:00.295 --> 01:07:01.263
Wait.

01:07:02.965 --> 01:07:04.633
He has to be fired.

01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:06.969
You should be fired.

01:07:08.537 --> 01:07:10.740
He should be fired.

01:07:10.773 --> 01:07:12.875
Your smoked tilapia.

01:07:15.678 --> 01:07:17.747
- Enjoy.
- One demerit.

01:07:27.389 --> 01:07:29.424
Put the money in the basket.

01:07:29.992 --> 01:07:31.426
Mortgage your home.

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:32.829
Mortgage your
children.

01:07:32.862 --> 01:07:34.663
You got lovely
children.

01:07:34.697 --> 01:07:35.698
My kind of guy.

01:07:50.012 --> 01:07:51.013
Management.

01:07:51.047 --> 01:07:52.447
Oh.

01:07:52.481 --> 01:07:56.318
Wait, wait! He should be fired!

01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:57.954
- Alan.
- Ah!

01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:12.969
Oh my God. It's worse
than we thought.

01:08:15.337 --> 01:08:18.006
We'll do anything, if you
give Gunther your money.

01:08:24.345 --> 01:08:26.581
No, this is bad.

01:08:27.415 --> 01:08:29.018
Stop. Stop!

01:08:29.051 --> 01:08:31.486
Hey, stop it!

01:08:33.622 --> 01:08:35.624
This man is a sham!

01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:37.526
- Who is this guy?
- Sit down!

01:08:37.559 --> 01:08:39.895
I know you all want to make your
lives better.

01:08:39.929 --> 01:08:44.399
And I know you think this guy is
going to do that. But he's not.

01:08:44.432 --> 01:08:45.701
Okay?

01:08:46.434 --> 01:08:47.636
What has he done for you?

01:08:48.104 --> 01:08:49.906
What
has he done for any of you?

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:53.075
What physical product has he
actually provided?

01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:55.812
- Let's get him!
- Let's get him with some violence.

01:08:55.845 --> 01:08:59.816
We don't rip him limb from limb. We do
not attack. We are peaceful people, yeah?

01:09:00.783 --> 01:09:04.754
Steve, the physical product is

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.589
the metaphysical being.

01:09:09.926 --> 01:09:11.493
It's hard for him to learn.

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:17.365
What the hell does that mean?
What are you clapping for?

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:19.301
Yes.

01:09:20.036 --> 01:09:21.502
Why are you crying, man?

01:09:21.536 --> 01:09:23.805
Okay. Okay.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.709
Then what's with all the
Sanz Hands hand sanitizer?

01:09:26.742 --> 01:09:27.642
What's it called?

01:09:27.676 --> 01:09:29.745
Sanz Hands hand sanitizer.

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:33.850
I believe in clean hands, guys.

01:09:36.853 --> 01:09:38.988
You can't just clap for
everything he says.

01:09:39.956 --> 01:09:43.024
I'd like to clarify that. You can applaud
everything I say. It's no problem.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.962
Shh.

01:09:49.966 --> 01:09:51.633
Okay, okay.

01:09:53.135 --> 01:09:58.841
Well, Gunther, well, why do you have
a thousand bottles of this stuff?

01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.476
- Ew, gross.
- Damn it, Josh.

01:10:01.509 --> 01:10:03.045
OMG, that's hot.

01:10:03.079 --> 01:10:05.815
- That right there, not appropriate.
- Come on.

01:10:07.817 --> 01:10:09.051
Ah-ha! That!

01:10:14.924 --> 01:10:18.895
I suffer from mysophobia,

01:10:18.928 --> 01:10:20.863
which is a fear of germs.

01:10:20.897 --> 01:10:24.100
One that is debilitating.

01:10:24.133 --> 01:10:29.504
Then I read the teachings of Khatkhate
Baba who showed me the way of clean.

01:10:29.537 --> 01:10:31.774
The way of the Sanz Hands
hand sanitizer

01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:37.612
which also was leading me on the
path to Spirifresh.

01:10:40.182 --> 01:10:43.618
Okay, if you buy in
bulk, like larger bottles,

01:10:43.652 --> 01:10:45.520
you could probably save a lot of
money that way.

01:10:52.828 --> 01:10:54.030
Just look at me, Josh.

01:10:55.898 --> 01:10:57.099
It's like the Eskimo.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.501
Like the Eskimos!

01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:03.605
Thank you, Josh. We love him.
We love you.

01:11:05.141 --> 01:11:08.978
I love Josh. I love Josh.
I love him here too.

01:11:09.011 --> 01:11:11.981
Okay, this is classic behavior.

01:11:12.014 --> 01:11:14.616
This is called poor conductor,

01:11:14.649 --> 01:11:16.852
because he sees
the choo-choo train,

01:11:16.886 --> 01:11:21.023
a successful man is going and he
wants to derail this poor conductor.

01:11:21.057 --> 01:11:23.059
I know.

01:11:23.092 --> 01:11:25.828
What the hell is the
matter with you?

01:11:26.628 --> 01:11:27.863
Boo this man.

01:11:30.066 --> 01:11:32.001
- Boo. Shame!
- Oh yeah.

01:11:32.835 --> 01:11:34.669
Shame!

01:11:36.806 --> 01:11:40.109
You think this is about
me not being happy?

01:11:41.643 --> 01:11:44.780
Let us ask Shteve. Say
it out loud, Shteve.

01:11:44.814 --> 01:11:46.749
- Shteve.
- It's Steve.

01:11:47.883 --> 01:11:50.252
Where were you 27
years ago, hmm?

01:11:55.324 --> 01:11:57.559
I was training here
as a bellman.

01:11:58.194 --> 01:12:00.896
Are you in a successful
relationship?

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:03.232
Have you accomplished any of
your dreams?

01:12:08.237 --> 01:12:10.806
Well Shteve, say it, Shteve.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.907
Shteve.

01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:13.042
That's not my name.

01:12:13.876 --> 01:12:17.046
What does your father think of
you, huh?

01:12:20.615 --> 01:12:23.152
Okay, when you're
ready, we're here for you.

01:12:23.185 --> 01:12:24.020
Happy birthday.

01:12:25.087 --> 01:12:27.289
Today could be the day
that you get born.

01:12:27.323 --> 01:12:28.190
Yeah?

01:12:29.225 --> 01:12:32.228
I'm going to give you a brochure
for Spirifresh.

01:12:37.066 --> 01:12:37.933
Hmm.

01:12:40.036 --> 01:12:45.975
Good, Shteve. Now, we have the new
perfect people here and let's get to it.

01:12:50.679 --> 01:12:53.682
I... I don't know exactly what
you were trying to prove here,

01:12:53.716 --> 01:12:57.787
but this... this... this is
unacceptable.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.388
Chief Macanopy,
I got to tell you,

01:12:59.422 --> 01:13:02.191
at the meeting I really prefer the
headdress and the feathers and everything,

01:13:02.224 --> 01:13:05.061
but right now you look thinner,
you look great.

01:13:05.094 --> 01:13:07.963
Oh, I love you. I love you.

01:13:07.997 --> 01:13:09.298
You are fired.

01:13:10.399 --> 01:13:12.835
And you're
fired too, Joshua.

01:13:37.827 --> 01:13:40.729
I was trying to save the
hotel and this is what... Ah!

01:14:39.455 --> 01:14:40.322
<i>Hola </i>.

01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:43.425
Is there a guy named
Steve here?

01:14:46.462 --> 01:14:48.197
Oh, great.

01:14:50.065 --> 01:14:52.201
Is there a <i>gringo </i> ?

01:15:02.278 --> 01:15:05.247
Okay, I'm
guessing Steve isn't here.

01:15:05.881 --> 01:15:06.982
Good guess.

01:15:10.019 --> 01:15:10.886
Steve.

01:15:11.754 --> 01:15:13.756
The Steve you knew is long gone.

01:15:13.789 --> 01:15:17.426
Around here my family calls me
" <i>idiota sin hogar</i> ."

01:15:17.459 --> 01:15:19.395
Your family? It's only
been a couple of days.

01:15:19.428 --> 01:15:21.230
Yeah, well we got close.

01:15:29.939 --> 01:15:32.141
It's a little inside joke
with the <i>pueblo </i>.

01:15:32.174 --> 01:15:33.976
You heard the
lady, I ain't leaving.

01:15:34.777 --> 01:15:36.312
This is the new Steve, baby.

01:15:40.549 --> 01:15:42.785
You know, donkeys can think for
themselves.

01:15:42.818 --> 01:15:44.353
That's why they're
better than horses.

01:15:44.386 --> 01:15:45.387
Here you go, buddy.

01:15:46.522 --> 01:15:47.756
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:50.993
Remember when we used to eat out
of the palm of our own hands?

01:15:51.026 --> 01:15:52.161
Psyche, we never did.

01:15:52.928 --> 01:15:54.096
I don't miss you at all.

01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:57.967
Steve...
Get out of my way, dude.

01:16:00.302 --> 01:16:02.137
He's standing on my toes now.

01:16:02.838 --> 01:16:03.772
Retreat.

01:16:05.207 --> 01:16:06.141
Retreat.

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:18.954
You need to eat something.

01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:24.526
Steve, you can't give up, man.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.761
Why not?

01:16:26.362 --> 01:16:27.329
I have nothing.

01:16:28.497 --> 01:16:30.165
Absolutely nothing.

01:16:30.199 --> 01:16:31.533
That's not true.

01:16:31.567 --> 01:16:32.901
You know, I tried to end it all.

01:16:34.069 --> 01:16:37.139
I bought a gun. I was going to
shoot myself in the face.

01:16:37.172 --> 01:16:38.340
Steve.

01:16:38.374 --> 01:16:40.376
A couple of priests convinced
me not to and stole my gun.

01:16:42.411 --> 01:16:43.545
I think they were priests.

01:16:43.579 --> 01:16:45.180
You got a lot to live for.

01:16:45.214 --> 01:16:47.216
You got the job, the hotel.

01:16:47.249 --> 01:16:50.286
After you left, Sid told Alan
everyone makes mistakes.

01:16:51.053 --> 01:16:52.689
He was way out
of line for firing you.

01:16:52.722 --> 01:16:56.058
Sid chased after you and tried to give you
your job back, but you were already gone.

01:16:56.091 --> 01:16:57.493
Sid chased after me?

01:16:58.861 --> 01:16:59.828
Good guy.

01:17:00.963 --> 01:17:02.031
What about Kelly?

01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:05.034
She seems more sad than anything
to be honest.

01:17:05.067 --> 01:17:06.468
If you go back
and tell her the truth...

01:17:06.502 --> 01:17:08.237
Oh, dude. She knows the truth.

01:17:09.238 --> 01:17:11.373
What's the point? We're all
getting fired anyway.

01:17:12.174 --> 01:17:13.375
Yeah, maybe.

01:17:17.179 --> 01:17:18.514
Or maybe not.

01:17:19.381 --> 01:17:22.251
I got an idea that can stop the
sale and keep our jobs,

01:17:22.284 --> 01:17:24.553
but you got
to come back with me right now.

01:17:30.192 --> 01:17:31.193
Look at me, I'm a mess.

01:17:32.628 --> 01:17:35.497
Well, let's get you cleaned up,
brother, starting with some clothes.

01:17:44.039 --> 01:17:44.940
Do it for Steve.

01:17:56.352 --> 01:17:58.087
Come on. Come on.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:58.987
About time.

01:18:00.055 --> 01:18:00.856
There we go.

01:18:07.429 --> 01:18:09.598
Well, hello little lady,
couldn't help...

01:18:09.631 --> 01:18:11.500
Turn off, turn off. Why? Why?

01:18:18.574 --> 01:18:21.910
Dude, why are you punching meat?

01:18:21.944 --> 01:18:25.581
You just need to go back, make some
apologies and fill out some paperwork.

01:18:27.684 --> 01:18:30.185
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

01:18:37.326 --> 01:18:39.561
I'll miss you most, carnicero.

01:18:44.533 --> 01:18:46.068
For you family.

01:19:00.182 --> 01:19:01.116
Hey, Josh.

01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:04.987
Wow.

01:19:05.554 --> 01:19:07.222
Look, I know I screwed up, man.

01:19:07.256 --> 01:19:09.057
All right, you should've never
trusted me.

01:19:09.658 --> 01:19:10.860
But for what it's worth,

01:19:10.894 --> 01:19:13.362
I thought you always had what it
takes to make a great bellman.

01:19:13.395 --> 01:19:15.130
Yeah, so?

01:19:15.664 --> 01:19:18.667
I mean what's the
difference now? This is my life.

01:19:18.701 --> 01:19:20.068
I want to make things right.

01:19:21.303 --> 01:19:24.540
I want to get our jobs back, go
back to the way things were.

01:19:24.573 --> 01:19:25.674
Why should I listen to you now?

01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:29.278
I don't know, okay. I've been
through some shit, man.

01:19:30.045 --> 01:19:31.714
Gained some serious perspective.

01:19:32.548 --> 01:19:34.717
I moved to Mexico, befriended a
donkey...

01:19:34.751 --> 01:19:37.286
Yeah, Steve, Steve. That's just
it. It's all about you.

01:19:37.319 --> 01:19:39.121
It's always all about you.

01:19:39.154 --> 01:19:42.324
I mean, Steve is the quarterback
and the defense

01:19:42.357 --> 01:19:44.460
and everybody else is
just cheerleaders.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:50.332
Steve is the all-beef patty, and we're
all just lettuce, tomato, onions.

01:19:52.601 --> 01:19:56.472
Steve is the sun rotating
around all of us stupid planets.

01:19:56.505 --> 01:19:59.541
You're right, I was only
thinking about what I wanted.

01:20:01.276 --> 01:20:02.411
But it's not about me.

01:20:02.444 --> 01:20:03.545
I get that now.

01:20:03.579 --> 01:20:04.546
It's about us.

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:06.114
It's about you guys.

01:20:06.148 --> 01:20:07.684
It's about the bellmen.

01:20:09.585 --> 01:20:14.490
Also, you know the planets
revolve around the sun, right?

01:20:15.758 --> 01:20:17.159
Sure, Steve.

01:20:18.695 --> 01:20:20.062
Whatever you say.

01:20:20.095 --> 01:20:23.532
Yeah, well I do. So do a lot of
people as it's a scientific fact.

01:20:23.565 --> 01:20:29.238
It's actually making me think, you know,
less of you when you say stuff like that.

01:20:29.271 --> 01:20:31.139
Let's just go back
to the hotel, huh?

01:20:31.173 --> 01:20:32.374
All right. Oh, wait.

01:20:33.542 --> 01:20:36.478
Do you happen to have any
connections inside the bank?

01:20:37.412 --> 01:20:39.448
The manager, I guess. He's
the one who hired me.

01:20:39.481 --> 01:20:41.250
Awesome. Can you introduce us?

01:20:41.283 --> 01:20:42.150
Sure.

01:20:43.552 --> 01:20:46.321
Hey Banky, this is Steve.

01:21:09.444 --> 01:21:11.313
Shit. Nightshift.

01:21:11.748 --> 01:21:12.749
You doing okay?

01:21:12.782 --> 01:21:14.383
- Oh, hi Steve.
- Hey, man.

01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:18.587
Yeah, we kind of um, we
kinda ran out of money.

01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:22.457
- Ah...
- We're broke. Okay, we spent all our money on Spirifresh.

01:21:22.491 --> 01:21:23.826
Gunther promised us
enlightenment.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.160
And what did he deliver?

01:21:26.395 --> 01:21:27.764
Hand sanitizer.

01:21:29.565 --> 01:21:30.532
Brad.

01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:33.101
Steve.

01:21:34.804 --> 01:21:36.605
Surprised to see you here.

01:21:37.606 --> 01:21:38.540
Well, I'm back.

01:21:39.474 --> 01:21:40.743
And I want to
make things right.

01:21:41.778 --> 01:21:43.445
Looks like
you got a promotion?

01:21:44.313 --> 01:21:46.548
Yeah, when you left, Susan
thought we needed

01:21:46.582 --> 01:21:49.151
a new Assistant Front Office
Manager, so.

01:21:50.352 --> 01:21:51.587
Who's bell captain these days?

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.422
- I think Rhonda.
- That makes sense.

01:21:53.455 --> 01:21:55.725
She wrestled skinny Jeremy
in Cashew milk.

01:21:55.758 --> 01:21:57.359
I would've paid to
see that.

01:22:00.195 --> 01:22:01.396
What's up, kid?

01:22:01.931 --> 01:22:02.799
Hey, Brad.

01:22:03.532 --> 01:22:04.867
What's the plan?

01:22:04.901 --> 01:22:06.501
No plan.

01:22:06.535 --> 01:22:08.604
- You just going to wing it?
- Yeah.

01:22:08.637 --> 01:22:10.439
Michael's the reason I'm
back here.

01:22:10.472 --> 01:22:12.875
Truth be told I was very content
in the desert with Steve.

01:22:12.909 --> 01:22:14.142
You took up a lover?

01:22:14.176 --> 01:22:15.344
No. Steve is my donkey.

01:22:15.878 --> 01:22:17.379
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:22:18.213 --> 01:22:19.314
You took up a lover?

01:22:19.849 --> 01:22:21.216
Brad, I'm into people.

01:22:21.918 --> 01:22:24.252
Mike. What's the game plan?

01:22:24.754 --> 01:22:26.455
Well, I'm gonna tell
you, but not here.

01:22:27.589 --> 01:22:28.925
The bell closet.

01:22:28.958 --> 01:22:30.559
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:22:31.426 --> 01:22:32.661
Fine. C'mon.

01:22:35.631 --> 01:22:38.433
Wait, you and your donkey
had the same name?

01:22:38.467 --> 01:22:41.570
- So, what happens...
- You gonna stay here right now?

01:22:44.774 --> 01:22:45.742
Oh, God!

01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:48.410
Hello, Alan.

01:22:48.443 --> 01:22:49.478
Hi, Kelly.

01:22:49.511 --> 01:22:53.716
I was just um, checking
the floor for buoyancy.

01:22:56.719 --> 01:22:57.820
I was spying on the bellmen.

01:23:04.994 --> 01:23:06.294
Nice work, man.

01:23:08.397 --> 01:23:09.564
27 years.

01:23:14.837 --> 01:23:15.872
You got the files?

01:23:21.744 --> 01:23:23.211
This is perfect.

01:23:26.481 --> 01:23:29.251
All right, listen up guys,
I need you to meet me here tonight.

01:23:29.986 --> 01:23:31.353
Here in the bell closet?

01:23:32.554 --> 01:23:36.425
No, the Spirifresh conference
in the ballroom at 7:00 p.m.

01:23:36.959 --> 01:23:38.961
Why did you need to
tell us that here?

01:23:40.697 --> 01:23:43.398
Oh, I didn't. I just hadn't seen this place
in a while and figured this was my chance.

01:23:50.372 --> 01:23:51.774
Ooh.

01:23:51.808 --> 01:23:53.542
That was a friendship slap.

01:23:53.575 --> 01:23:56.278

It always is.

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.829

01:24:25.574 --> 01:24:27.442
<i>Um, hello?</i>

01:24:33.783 --> 01:24:35.417
Hi, I'm Leroy.

01:24:37.687 --> 01:24:38.888
I'm Alan.

01:24:45.094 --> 01:24:46.763
Let's finish early tonight.

01:24:46.796 --> 01:24:48.197
I want to get home.

01:24:48.231 --> 01:24:51.734
Oh, I cannot do that for you because
time is a construct of the mind.

01:24:51.768 --> 01:24:54.336
So, I don't know when we're going to...

01:24:54.369 --> 01:24:55.872
Fine. 9:00-9:30 latest.

01:24:55.905 --> 01:24:57.740
Und the reason

01:24:57.774 --> 01:25:02.712
that Snoopy und Woodstock never
speak to the other Peanuts

01:25:03.512 --> 01:25:06.381
is because Snoopy and Woodstock

01:25:06.414 --> 01:25:09.484
are the ghosts of dead children.

01:25:09.518 --> 01:25:12.755
What am I doing here? I sign
the contracts tomorrow.

01:25:13.856 --> 01:25:16.692
Mr. Whitman, before you sign anything
there's something you need to see.

01:25:16.726 --> 01:25:21.030
And I ask you,
who controls your heart?

01:25:21.063 --> 01:25:24.767
Hmm. It's not who you
think. It's you.

01:25:24.801 --> 01:25:27.602
- Steve controls our heart.
- No, that was a separate thought.

01:25:33.375 --> 01:25:37.479
Today is the day that I prove to
my friends and previous employers

01:25:37.512 --> 01:25:40.415
that I am worthy of
not just a paycheck.

01:25:40.448 --> 01:25:43.518
But a journey of responsibility.

01:25:43.552 --> 01:25:47.123
I have proof that Gunther is
going to sign a deal

01:25:47.156 --> 01:25:51.060
to buy the hotel tomorrow and he's
going to turn it into an Indian Casino.

01:25:51.093 --> 01:25:53.361
- Who cares?
- He's making us perfect.

01:25:53.395 --> 01:25:55.798
Gunther is not even
Native American.

01:25:55.832 --> 01:25:58.067
Nor does he have the
collateral for the loan.

01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.970
He's a fraud. I have here in my
hand...

01:26:01.003 --> 01:26:03.405
He has no proof.

01:26:03.438 --> 01:26:04.472
Proof.

01:26:04.506 --> 01:26:05.942
Oh, wow. He's got proof.

01:26:05.975 --> 01:26:08.044
This is his birth certificate.

01:26:08.077 --> 01:26:09.644
Look at this, he's not
Chief Macanopy.

01:26:09.679 --> 01:26:13.548
His name isn't even Gunther
Gochamonet, which is a little on the nose.

01:26:14.449 --> 01:26:17.153
This is his business license.

01:26:17.186 --> 01:26:19.722
You'll notice he
misspelled LLC.

01:26:19.755 --> 01:26:23.025
All fake. It means nothing without
my Lender Agreement from the bank.

01:26:23.059 --> 01:26:25.127
And this is his Lender
Agreement from the bank.

01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:26.595
Shite!

01:26:26.628 --> 01:26:29.531
And we have Banky to thank for that info.
Give Banky a round of applause.

01:26:33.069 --> 01:26:36.605
He is scamming you,
he is scamming the great state of Arizona,

01:26:36.638 --> 01:26:41.610
he is scamming the great city of
Tucson, and Sid, he's scamming you.

01:26:41.643 --> 01:26:45.982
This is a bunch of BS... pardon
my language.

01:26:46.015 --> 01:26:48.885
Because I'll tell
you right now, this is fake.

01:26:48.918 --> 01:26:53.890
And there's a whole other point
of view, in which what I said was true.

01:26:53.923 --> 01:26:56.092
I'm just sick of the white
man's lies.

01:26:57.026 --> 01:26:58.794
Sister, you and me
both, yeah?

01:26:58.828 --> 01:27:01.663
Very different story than what
you hear right now from this...

01:27:01.697 --> 01:27:04.934
Guess what? Psycho big bird's the
one been stealing all the robes.

01:27:04.967 --> 01:27:06.769
That could be any robe anywhere.

01:27:06.802 --> 01:27:09.105
- No, that is the robes...
- It could be from any place.

01:27:09.138 --> 01:27:11.539
- Those are our robes.
- That's... this is not...

01:27:11.573 --> 01:27:15.477
I will not be part of this... I
will not be a witch hunt.

01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:19.514
Stop him!

01:27:19.949 --> 01:27:22.417
Told you he jumps
a hell of a lot.

01:27:23.618 --> 01:27:25.054
Holy G! Is that...?

01:27:25.087 --> 01:27:26.689
Sauggie!

01:27:26.722 --> 01:27:27.589
The cactus.

01:27:27.622 --> 01:27:30.860
Sauggie's back. Sauggie's
finally back.

01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:42.805
But how did you find
all of this out?

01:27:42.838 --> 01:27:45.174
Yucopicio's been trailing
Gunther for months.

01:27:45.207 --> 01:27:48.044
He's a double agent
for the Indian Gaming Commission.

01:27:48.077 --> 01:27:50.612
Sauggie, he's a triple agent.

01:27:50.645 --> 01:27:51.814
Conditions were tough.

01:27:51.847 --> 01:27:53.182
We almost lost them.

01:27:53.215 --> 01:27:54.717
Now that the case has
been cracked,

01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:57.687
something tells me things are going to
get a little bit easier for Sauggie.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.255
Right, buddy? Ah, prick.

01:27:59.288 --> 01:28:00.790
Take him away, Banky.

01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.102
Now, needless to say, this deal
is off.

01:28:13.135 --> 01:28:15.603
You know what? I'm not moving
down to Florida with my wife.

01:28:15.637 --> 01:28:17.740
I'm staying right here in
Tucson.

01:28:23.913 --> 01:28:29.218
Guys, guys, I found out who's been
stealing the robes. It was Gunther.

01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:35.725
Nice work, Alan. You do
a good job around here.

01:28:35.758 --> 01:28:38.094
Aw, thanks.

01:28:38.127 --> 01:28:40.595
Well it looks like everything's
wrapped up the way it should...

01:28:41.697 --> 01:28:42.698
Kelly.

01:28:42.732 --> 01:28:44.934
- Who's Kelly?
- Chief Concierge.

01:28:44.967 --> 01:28:46.268
Her and Steve used to
date.

01:28:49.637 --> 01:28:50.505
Kelly, uh,

01:28:51.539 --> 01:28:53.541
I need you to know
that I have a crush on you,

01:28:53.575 --> 01:28:55.044
like, I like you more than a
friend.

01:28:56.245 --> 01:28:59.749
I have dreams about you.

01:28:59.782 --> 01:29:02.752
Not like weird, like sexual
dreams.

01:29:02.785 --> 01:29:08.791
Dreams of like taking you out for dinner,
or spending time with you on a Sunday.

01:29:09.825 --> 01:29:12.594
I want to be with you, Kelly.
I want...

01:29:12.627 --> 01:29:15.264
Now, come on now, Kelly.
Give him a chance.

01:29:16.065 --> 01:29:18.566
I don't know, Patty. I mean,
I'm not sure he's ready...

01:29:19.802 --> 01:29:20.836
Shut up, bitch!

01:29:22.238 --> 01:29:23.605
Thanks, Patty.

01:29:25.107 --> 01:29:28.610
- Getting held up at gunpoint...
- Shut up and just go get her.

01:29:38.087 --> 01:29:40.622

It's the first time I'm
hearing about it.

01:30:02.144 --> 01:30:06.215
This is... this is terribly
inappropriate with misconduct.

01:30:07.083 --> 01:30:09.351
Ah, Susan. Love is love.

01:30:16.325 --> 01:30:18.727
Did you know Alan and Susan had
something going on too?

01:30:18.761 --> 01:30:20.296
They're great. They've
always been a thing.

01:30:23.332 --> 01:30:28.270
I am married with many, many,

It's a happy ending

01:30:32.708 --> 01:30:34.076
What do we do now?

Who are we supposed to give our
money to now?

01:30:44.787 --> 01:30:48.324

the Bravo tipping app,

01:30:48.357 --> 01:30:52.962

01:31:11.714 --> 01:31:13.949
I sent all my money to
Josh.

01:31:18.154 --> 01:31:22.091
Steve, if you'd like that promotion,
the job of manager is yours.

01:31:25.227 --> 01:31:28.297
Thank you, Susan. But I like
being a bellman.

01:31:31.333 --> 01:31:32.434
A lot.

01:31:33.435 --> 01:31:34.403
Yes.

01:31:36.739 --> 01:31:38.707
Plus, Brad's doing a
pretty bang up job.

01:31:38.741 --> 01:31:39.842
Thanks, man.

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:41.877
Oh, that reminds me.
I almost forgot.

01:31:41.911 --> 01:31:47.816
Josh, I hereby decree that you have
successfully completed stage three.

01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:49.051
When?

01:31:49.084 --> 01:31:51.220
When you helped us
save the hotel!

01:31:57.826 --> 01:31:58.994
Congrats, Josh.

01:32:00.396 --> 01:32:03.032
You are officially a bellman.

01:32:03.065 --> 01:32:04.133
Oh.

01:32:04.166 --> 01:32:05.868
Congratulations, stupid idiot.

01:32:06.402 --> 01:32:07.803
Finally, one of us.

01:32:07.836 --> 01:32:10.973
- Yeah, stupid idiot.
- Know your place.

01:32:11.006 --> 01:32:13.375
Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh!

01:32:13.409 --> 01:32:14.343
Wait,

01:32:15.878 --> 01:32:20.082
so the third stage was you pretending
to get a promotion to get Kelly back,

01:32:20.115 --> 01:32:23.152
and the guys falling into the
trap of a con artist

01:32:23.185 --> 01:32:25.087
who manipulates his
followers out of money,

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:28.257
while also lying about his
heritage in order to buy the hotel

01:32:28.290 --> 01:32:31.894
and me having to figure all that out was
the final stage of becoming a bellman?

01:32:31.927 --> 01:32:33.329
- Yeah.
- Spot on, dude.

01:32:35.798 --> 01:32:38.067
Yeah, that's pretty much
the plot of this movie.

01:33:04.226 --> 01:33:08.831
Rolling. Mark, and
action.

01:33:08.864 --> 01:33:13.202
She wrestled boney Jeremy.
Hold on. I got this.

01:33:13.235 --> 01:33:15.237
Who's bell captain these days?

01:33:15.271 --> 01:33:18.073
Tight Rhonda. That wasn't it.

01:33:18.107 --> 01:33:19.908
Who cares, he's
shaking his head.

01:33:19.942 --> 01:33:21.377
She wrestled skinny Jeremy.

01:33:24.013 --> 01:33:25.481
- Do that one again.
- Yeah.

01:33:25.514 --> 01:33:28.884
If you want to go back and live the
sweet bellman life, that's fine with me,

01:33:28.917 --> 01:33:32.521
but God damn it,
I got a donkey and he's body checking me.

01:33:32.554 --> 01:33:34.323
There's plenty of me
to go around, baby.

01:33:34.356 --> 01:33:35.858
Oh, Steve.

01:33:35.891 --> 01:33:39.528
Eat it, man. We practiced this.
Come on, my fucking friends are watching.

01:33:40.396 --> 01:33:43.365
Do it. Do it. Do it.

01:33:43.399 --> 01:33:44.867
Listen, listen, dude.

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:46.835
Do it. Do it.

01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:50.939
A kid and a goat, laughter
is not something...

01:33:50.973 --> 01:33:51.840
No. Cool.

01:33:55.477 --> 01:33:58.147
He like gave me notes like as
if these lines made sense.

01:33:59.281 --> 01:34:01.016
What the fuck? Okay.

01:34:03.485 --> 01:34:05.120
Congratulations, baby.

01:34:05.154 --> 01:34:06.388
Thanks, Patty.

01:34:06.422 --> 01:34:08.324
That's so great. We getting
fucked up tonight.

01:34:08.357 --> 01:34:11.060
- Oh, you know that, girl.
- Shots, shots, shots.

01:34:11.093 --> 01:34:12.928
Shteve is a real human being.

01:34:14.196 --> 01:34:16.265
Forgot that you were there and
the cameras were on.

01:34:16.298 --> 01:34:17.232
You wanna fuck?

01:34:18.434 --> 01:34:19.301
Sure.

01:34:26.175 --> 01:34:27.476
All right, let's cut.

01:34:29.144 --> 01:34:31.413
You knew,
you knew this was going to happen.

01:34:31.447 --> 01:34:32.881
<i>I mean, obviously.</i>
