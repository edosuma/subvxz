Figger it out.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.078

<i>Then forks come in</i>
<i>and take it over to a container.</i>

03:19.241 --> 03:21.118
‐ I fuckin' hate skids.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.579
DAN: What kinds of container?
KEITH: <i>Like a train car.</i>

03:23.579 --> 03:25.080
‐ One of those ocean freightliners there?

03:25.080 --> 03:27.332
‐ Oh, like when a hippies
make small houses happen.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.293
KEITH: <i>The forks come in</i>
<i>and take the skids with a couple bags</i>

03:29.293 --> 03:30.544
<i>to the container, then Thibodeau</i>

03:30.544 --> 03:33.213

03:33.213 --> 03:34.882
‐ Why are you double‐handling?
KEITH: <i>Huh?</i>

03:34.882 --> 03:36.508
‐ You're gonna wanna watch
your carbon footprints too.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.594
‐ Well, you hand bomb
the bags on to the skid,

03:38.594 --> 03:41.054
then the forks come over,
take the skid over to the container.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.848
Just skip the fucking skid,

03:42.848 --> 03:45.392
hand bomb the bags straight
on to the container. What's the problem?

03:45.392 --> 03:47.019
KEITH: <i>It gets too hot</i>
<i>inside the container</i>

03:47.019 --> 03:48.645
<i>to be going</i>
<i>in and out all day.</i>

03:48.645 --> 03:50.230
‐ Well, sounds like
your old man should have

03:50.230 --> 03:51.732
kicked your ass another time or two.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.692
KEITH: <i>Oh, this isn't from me.</i>
<i>That's direct from boss hog.</i>

03:53.692 --> 03:55.235

04:01.450 --> 04:03.911
KEITH: <i>No, no, no. Can't do that stuff</i>
<i>in the workplace anymore.</i>

04:03.911 --> 04:05.621
‐ No. Yeah, you can.
Just kick him in the ass,

04:05.621 --> 04:07.706
get the fuck outta the way.
‐ Put a shoulder in him.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.375
KEITH: <i>Ah, no. The kids'll complain</i>
<i>about that stuff now.</i>

04:10.375 --> 04:13.045
<i>Fuckin' anxiety and depression, autism.</i>

04:13.045 --> 04:14.755
‐ Yup. Uncle Eddie used to say,

04:14.755 --> 04:16.507
"'Kay. Here's anxiety." Okay?

04:16.507 --> 04:18.800
"Here's depression.
I don't think you've met 'em."

04:18.800 --> 04:20.552
KEITH:
<i>I said autism, too, but...</i>

04:20.552 --> 04:23.138
‐ Listen. There is always...

04:23.138 --> 04:25.516
always an alternative to violence.

04:25.516 --> 04:28.977
On that, I would like to be
crystals clears.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.479
Except if you're workin' fuckin' labor.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.605
WAYNE: Exactly.
KEITH: <i>Yeah.</i>

04:31.605 --> 04:33.941
‐ You could be...
You could be making sandwiches,

04:33.941 --> 04:35.817
or fuckin' scooping ice cream.
‐ He could be doing anything.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.945
‐ You could be doing just about
fucking anything.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.363
You chose labor.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.864
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Yeah, that was your choice.

04:40.864 --> 04:41.949
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Yeah, yeah.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.408
You can't be fuckin' choosing labor

04:43.408 --> 04:45.035
and then slowing ups productions.
‐ No.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.286
KEITH:
<i>They call that bullying now.</i>

04:46.286 --> 04:47.996
‐ Well... [scoffs]
‐ It's not bullying!

04:47.996 --> 04:49.706
It's tough love.
There's a fucking difference.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.626
Don't open your mouth if you're gonna be
fucking stupid, Graydaniels.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.711
‐ Yeah, the older kids gave it to us
when we were young, too.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.547
That's why we didn't turn out
tits like Thibodeau.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.465
‐ Yeah, but don't, like,
give up on him either, right?

04:58.465 --> 05:01.718
It's kind of... kind of the whole point
of the thing, like...

05:01.718 --> 05:03.470
You know, you keep your foot in it.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.014
And if he wants to fuck dog,
make life hard for him.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.475
So he'll either stop
fuckin' dog or he'll quit.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.726
KEITH:
<i>Sounds like a win‐win.</i>

05:09.726 --> 05:11.687
WAYNE: Well,
that's exactly what it is, Greydaniels.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.730
‐ He'd likely end up
some place he's happier,

05:13.730 --> 05:16.567
and you're fuckin' happier 'cause you
don't have a tit slowin' up production.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.026
‐ Bing‐bang‐boom.
‐ Yeah, he's right.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.653
You gotta put feelings aside
when there's work to be done.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.321
‐ Yeah.
KEITH: <i>That's good advice.</i>

05:21.321 --> 05:22.948
<i>I got my foot in it.</i>

you give 'em a red card
