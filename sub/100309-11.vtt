WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.669
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.669 --> 00:04.338
Zeke, what is this?

00:04.338 --> 00:06.273
Frostbite.
I may be freezing to death.

00:06.273 --> 00:08.308
Saanvi thinks she can help.
She may have a cure.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.110
It was the first one
I ever drew,

00:10.110 --> 00:12.713
and I actually never
figured out what it meant.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.481
It still kind of
creeps me out.

00:14.481 --> 00:15.682
The best way
to destroy a hate group

00:15.682 --> 00:16.817
is to blow it up
from the inside.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.218
You've been undercover?

00:18.218 --> 00:19.319
Why didn't you tell me?

00:19.319 --> 00:20.554
Because I needed you
to believe

00:20.554 --> 00:22.256
I was in so deep
that they'd believe.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.591
The minute we release this guy,
he's gonna call the cops.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.693
Don't say a word.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.095
My water just broke.

00:28.095 --> 00:29.496
I've done this surgery
many times,

00:29.496 --> 00:30.764
but the baby's heart rate
has been dropping.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.533
We need to go now.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.368
I don't know how to thank you.
If you didn't get here, I --

00:34.368 --> 00:36.103
It was actually something
of a miracle that I did.

00:36.103 --> 00:38.138
I was kayaking earlier today
in the Harlem River.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.773
Lost my balance,
and I flipped over.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.875
A total stranger
saved my life.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.377
Ben: If you needed
any more proof

00:43.377 --> 00:44.811
that the Callings are good,
this is it.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.480
"False prophets will arise
from the dead

00:46.480 --> 00:48.382
to perform
signs and wonders."

00:48.382 --> 00:50.751
You keep assuming
we're on the side of good, Ben.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.152
We are returned from the dead

00:52.152 --> 00:54.521
to be agents
of the apocalypse.

01:04.097 --> 01:05.799
Ben, you've gone off
the deep end.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.768
Just hear me out.
What, that we're false prophets

01:07.768 --> 01:09.236
coming back from the dead?

01:09.236 --> 01:10.704
I thought you got off
this theory months ago

01:10.704 --> 01:13.140
when the Calling
saved Grace and the baby.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.342
Yeah, but pretty much
every single night since then,

01:15.342 --> 01:18.278
Cal's been terrorized
by these three looming shadows.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.047
Still?

01:23.650 --> 01:26.620
You must really be
desperate for answers.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.388
Science guy
looking in the Bible.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.324
I just found this
in Revelation,

01:30.324 --> 01:33.560
and it weirdly echoes
Adrian's apocalypse theory.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.829
"I saw three spirits coming out
of the mouth of the dragon,

01:35.829 --> 01:37.364
out of the mouth
of the beast,

01:37.364 --> 01:39.633
out of the mouth
of the false prophet."

01:39.633 --> 01:43.303
Okay, that's creepy,
but the Callings --

01:43.303 --> 01:44.571
Think about the good, too.

01:44.571 --> 01:46.206
Which I keep
reminding myself,

01:46.206 --> 01:48.642
but, Mick, what Cal's seeing
is so dark,

01:48.642 --> 01:50.277
I keep coming back
to Adrian.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.513
I mean, what if this is
all "signs and wonders"?

01:53.513 --> 01:56.450
So, what, we're doing good
but for bad reasons?

01:56.450 --> 01:59.619
To lull us into obedience for
some end-of-the-world scenario.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.756
It's
a really messed-up theory.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.096
I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.831
How's Zeke?

02:10.831 --> 02:13.300
It's hard to tell.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.535
He never complains.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.204
It's not fair, though.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.639
He's at the hospital
every single day.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.240
The treatment regimen
is relentless.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.075
Saanvi thinks it's helping?

02:22.075 --> 02:25.379
It's slowing the frostbite,
but, no, Ben, it's not a cure.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.749
I am hoping
for a freaking miracle

02:28.749 --> 02:32.619
'cause if not,
he's running out of time.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.861
I can already tell
this is gonna be a tough one.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.729
I woke up wanting to use
so bad it hurt.

02:42.729 --> 02:46.566
Why today, do you think?

02:46.566 --> 02:48.435
It's...

02:48.435 --> 02:50.704
the anniversary
of my sister Chloe's death.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.176
We all dealt with her death
in our own messed-up ways.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.544
My dad bailed.

02:57.544 --> 03:00.180
My mom withdrew.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.650
And I-I-I turned to drugs
to numb the pain.

03:03.650 --> 03:06.253
So, in a way, this is
also the anniversary

03:06.253 --> 03:09.189
of your addiction.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.658
Good news is,
you're in recovery now.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.593
How's that going?

03:13.593 --> 03:17.564
If I'm being honest,
working the steps

03:17.564 --> 03:19.433
has been feeling
a little pointless lately.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.168
Just take it
one day at a time.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.737
That's the thing.
I may not have many days left.

03:25.238 --> 03:28.742
Look, I don't want sympathy.
I mean, it is what it is.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.844
But it's hard to work
towards something

03:30.844 --> 03:33.480
when you know you're dying.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.651
It might be
about closure now.

03:37.651 --> 03:41.688
Making peace
with others and yourself.

03:41.688 --> 03:45.058
You've been so focused
on seeking forgiveness.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.429
Who do you need
to forgive?

03:54.468 --> 03:58.505
Okay, I still don't know who

03:58.505 --> 04:00.507
or what you are exactly,

04:00.507 --> 04:04.044
other than a voice in my head.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.379
But enough is enough.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.648
Since the plane came back, you
have called on me relentlessly,

04:08.648 --> 04:10.283
and I've listened.

04:10.283 --> 04:13.620
I've literally done everything
that you wanted

04:13.620 --> 04:16.289
because I believe that
what you're asking us to do

04:16.289 --> 04:17.424
is for a purpose.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.526
I mean, it has to be.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.233
So why,
after all that I've done,

04:26.233 --> 04:30.237
am I watching the man I love
freeze to death?

04:30.237 --> 04:33.673
A good, kind man
who also listens to you,

04:33.673 --> 04:39.379
who has worked so hard
to redeem himself.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.615
He doesn't deserve this.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.088
How am I supposed to know that
this is for some greater good

04:48.088 --> 04:51.758
if you just let him die?

04:51.758 --> 04:54.127
How am I supposed
to keep listening?

04:58.365 --> 05:00.167
I need to understand.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.369
I don't want to lose faith.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.404
Don't make me.

05:18.650 --> 05:21.180
Hey! Hey!
Stop! Thief!

05:21.180 --> 05:24.050
Hey! Somebody stop him!
-NYPD! Stop!

05:27.150 --> 05:28.160
Ohh!

05:28.160 --> 05:29.420
Ow!

05:29.420 --> 05:30.360
Get up.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.690
Hands up.
Hands up.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.460
It's your unlucky day, kid.
I'm a cop.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.760
No, no, p-please, ma'am.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.770
It was just a candy bar.

05:38.770 --> 05:40.700
It was the first time ever,
I swear.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.400
I'm gonna be
in so much trouble.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.840
You don't understand.
My mom's gonna kill me.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.570
Well, you should have
thought about that be--

05:45.570 --> 05:47.340
Michaela:
Let him go.

05:47.340 --> 05:49.080
Let him go.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.820
Look, kid,
don't be stupid, okay?

05:55.820 --> 05:57.220
If I catch you
doing this again...

05:57.220 --> 05:58.190
Okay.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.190
Go.

06:11.670 --> 06:13.330
What the hell is this?

06:13.330 --> 06:15.540
It's what the kid stole.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.710
No, it isn't.

06:20.110 --> 06:21.340
This is.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.680
20 boxes, maybe.
I was restocking.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.480
I turned my back
for one second, and, bam.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.720
Bodega down the way
got hit a couple days ago.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.820
Same thing.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.290
Cold medicine.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.390
Do you know
what they use it for?

06:32.390 --> 06:33.990
To cook meth.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.760
Can I run something
by you?

06:38.760 --> 06:40.090
Always.

06:43.800 --> 06:49.140
I, um, caught a kid
stealing a candy bar,

06:49.140 --> 06:52.810
and then I get a Calling
telling me to let him go.

06:52.810 --> 06:54.840
S-So I did.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.640
And...?

06:56.640 --> 06:58.680
Turns out the candy bar
was just a decoy,

06:58.680 --> 07:01.580
and he had half a case of
cold medicine in his backpack.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.680
So you think the candy-bar
kid's cooking meth?

07:03.680 --> 07:05.350
I don't know.
The bodega owner said

07:05.350 --> 07:07.420
a place down the street
got hit a few days ago.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.620
So, yeah, it makes me think
it was the same kid.

07:09.620 --> 07:13.390
Or he could be part
of a bigger operation.

07:13.390 --> 07:15.630
Maybe that's why the Calling
told me to let him go,

07:15.630 --> 07:18.170
so that we could catch
the bigger fish.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.530
That's a terrible plan.

07:19.530 --> 07:21.140
More helpful would have been
to bring him in

07:21.140 --> 07:22.770
so we could interrogate him.

07:22.770 --> 07:24.310
Mick, why does it feel like

07:24.310 --> 07:25.740
you're always trying
to justify the Callings?

07:25.740 --> 07:29.140
Because I gotta believe
they're good, Jared.

07:29.140 --> 07:33.210
Well, I should probably
help you track this kid down.

07:33.210 --> 07:35.380
Unless you want to let her in
on your, uh, gift.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.280
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.590
I'm, uh, probably gonna
peel off with Vasquez today.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.390
Really?
Yeah, I witnessed a crime.

07:41.390 --> 07:42.690
He thinks
it could be related

07:42.690 --> 07:44.220
to a bunch of robberies
he's tracking.

07:44.220 --> 07:45.490
Yeah, you sure
he's not just trying

07:45.490 --> 07:47.090
to get back in your pants?

07:47.090 --> 07:49.260
Um, no,
I asked him to help.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.470
Okay, alright, well,
if you're good, I'm good.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.330
It'll give me a chance to
catch up on some paperwork.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.800
Hey, Vasquez, this is
just a loaner, okay?

07:56.800 --> 07:58.670
Yeah.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.780
Come on, Eden.

08:03.780 --> 08:06.080
Give Daddy a little smile.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.380
Pbht!

08:10.780 --> 08:13.590
I think
your daddy's lost it.

08:15.090 --> 08:17.460
She doesn't perform
on command...yet.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.690
Ohh.
Come here, you little diva.

08:19.690 --> 08:21.530
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

08:21.530 --> 08:23.260
Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh,

08:23.260 --> 08:25.700
shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

08:25.700 --> 08:30.240
♪ Frosty winter into spring ♪

08:31.310 --> 08:35.340
♪ Sunny summer into fall ♪

08:35.340 --> 08:37.340
♪ I will love you
through it all ♪

08:37.340 --> 08:39.810
She likes that one.
Where's it from?

08:39.810 --> 08:41.820
You want to hear
something so sweet?

08:41.820 --> 08:43.820
Cal was singing it to her.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.490
Oh.

08:50.260 --> 08:51.530
You saw something.

08:51.530 --> 08:55.130
Yeah, it was...
some kind of train.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.100
But the Calling,
it felt different.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.170
Different how?

09:01.170 --> 09:04.000
Like I was gonna die.

09:10.380 --> 09:13.050
You know what would go
really well with this drink?

09:13.050 --> 09:14.550
Dim sum.

09:14.550 --> 09:16.150
There's a killer place
around here.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.350
Dim sum?

09:17.350 --> 09:18.520
Alright, bud,
I gotta get you home.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.050
I got class tonight.

09:20.050 --> 09:22.460
Fine, but we should all go
sometime, as a family.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.730
Wait.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.190
You saying I'm family now?

09:26.190 --> 09:28.700
Uh, yeah, kinda.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.260
Plus, when you order
with a big group,

09:30.260 --> 09:32.100
you can order
all different kinds.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.100
Yeah, that's a good point.

09:45.510 --> 09:49.350
You didn't just see
three dark shadows, did you?

09:49.350 --> 09:50.820
No.

09:50.820 --> 09:53.750
But I did see something.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.560
It was, like, all these
little pieces of glass

09:55.560 --> 09:58.490
that came together and formed
this huge bird with talons.

09:58.490 --> 10:00.360
A phoenix, I think.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.100
Which represents
life and rebirth.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.760
I looked it up.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.270
Cal said
you were pretty spooked.

10:06.270 --> 10:07.670
It was weird.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.300
I mean, the picture
was bright and cheerful,

10:09.300 --> 10:11.270
but I felt so...sad.

10:11.270 --> 10:14.170
Ben: Huh.
Hopeless, almost.

10:14.170 --> 10:15.440
It was just different.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.640
Hmm.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.510
This bird with talons --

10:18.510 --> 10:22.550
Could it have been a -- a dragon
or some other mythical beast?

10:22.550 --> 10:24.650
I mean, it really looked
like a phoenix. Why?

10:24.650 --> 10:26.250
Uh,
grasping at straws, maybe,

10:26.250 --> 10:28.820
but your picture, my trains,

10:28.820 --> 10:31.460
uh, Cal's shadows all...

10:31.460 --> 10:32.830
felt like doom and gloom.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.560
Hopefully not
our doom and gloom.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.360
We've been on a pretty good
streak since the baby was born.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.370
True.

10:39.370 --> 10:41.840
What if they're related
in some other way?

10:41.840 --> 10:44.400
You said the phoenix looked
as though it were made up

10:44.400 --> 10:46.370
of tiny little pieces
of glass.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.240
Could it have been a mosaic?

10:48.240 --> 10:50.580
Yeah. I suppose.

10:50.580 --> 10:53.580
Because some of the subway
stations have those big murals.

10:53.580 --> 10:54.850
That could have been
the train I saw.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.420
There's a bunch
of this stuff.

10:59.550 --> 11:01.790
Any of those look familiar?

11:01.790 --> 11:03.520
Yeah, that's the one.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.690
Let's see it.

11:06.690 --> 11:08.630
It's downtown. Bowery.

11:08.630 --> 11:10.530
We should check it out.
Yeah.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.170
Baby, she's sleeping.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.100
She's not gonna smile
any time soon.

11:17.670 --> 11:19.640
But don't forget we have
her four-month checkup later.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.810
I'll be back
to pick you up.

11:21.810 --> 11:24.310
I'm gonna do
a little more debridement

11:24.310 --> 11:26.610
of the dead skin later, okay?

11:26.610 --> 11:27.610
Oh, joy.

11:27.610 --> 11:29.280
I know it's painful.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.820
We're trying to slow
the migration.

11:31.820 --> 11:33.820
MRI will tell us if there's
been any deterioration

11:33.820 --> 11:35.560
since your last scan.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.560
I need to, uh, replace your
warm fluids with some cold dye.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.760
Sorry.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.760
You love torturing me,
don't you?

11:42.760 --> 11:44.530
Not even a little.

11:44.530 --> 11:48.100
What else
is going on with you?

11:48.100 --> 11:49.500
At my meeting today,

11:49.500 --> 11:51.370
my sponsor said
I should be finding closure

11:51.370 --> 11:54.340
so I'm ready to move on.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.740
Kinda made me mad
'cause I'm not ready.

11:56.740 --> 11:58.410
There's no reason
you should be.

11:58.410 --> 11:59.850
It's not fair
what's happening to you.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.250
More painful
than the treatment

12:01.250 --> 12:03.520
is how
it's affecting Michaela.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.290
She really
is my soul mate.

12:05.290 --> 12:06.820
I know how you feel.

12:06.820 --> 12:09.720
I mean, it's not the same,
but, yeah.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.220
Of course. Alex.

12:11.220 --> 12:13.560
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.130
Hey, at least
there is hope for you.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.600
I have faith
in my retrovirus.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.770
We just have to keep
the frostbite in check

12:19.770 --> 12:22.170
until I fine-tune
the formula.

12:22.170 --> 12:23.500
Wait, you're still
experimenting?

12:23.500 --> 12:25.240
Of course.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.110
I mean,
a little more carefully

12:27.110 --> 12:28.810
since the little Alex fiasco,
but yeah.

12:28.810 --> 12:31.210
Al-Zuras' journal
didn't warn you off?

12:31.210 --> 12:33.680
It said the Callings were the
only way around the Death Date,

12:33.680 --> 12:36.080
that everything else
was a path to disaster.

12:37.720 --> 12:42.190
Medicine has come a long way
since bleeding and leeches.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.490
There's so many illnesses
that were a death sentence

12:44.490 --> 12:46.460
and now have a cure.
Why is this any different?

12:46.460 --> 12:47.790
You really believe that?

12:51.370 --> 12:54.230
Once I figure out how
to reverse the DNA anomaly,

12:54.230 --> 12:55.670
we can go back
to being ordinary.

12:55.670 --> 12:57.440
No Callings,
no more Death Date.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.470
I hope so.

12:58.470 --> 12:59.810
Yeah, me too.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.590
We're trying to track down
one of your riders.

13:12.590 --> 13:14.250
Happy to help
any way I can.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.760
Got on at 156th and Hewitt
a little after 9:00.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.160
You know what?

13:18.160 --> 13:19.490
Right on time.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.460
Do you mind
if we talk to the driver?

13:21.460 --> 13:25.300
Um, that would be Kory.

13:25.300 --> 13:28.240
I'll see if he's here.
-Thanks.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.640
I had Diaz put together a map
of robberies similar to yours.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.210
It's all across
the boroughs.

13:33.210 --> 13:35.740
If this is all the same
operation, then it's huge.

13:35.740 --> 13:38.150
You're looking for one
of my riders?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.250
Hey, yeah.
Uh, he's about 17,

13:40.250 --> 13:42.850
brown hair, backpack,
got on a little after 9:00.

13:42.850 --> 13:44.850
A lot of kids get on my bus
around that time.

13:44.850 --> 13:46.450
Guy was shoplifting,

13:46.450 --> 13:49.290
probably got on last minute,
definitely winded.

13:49.290 --> 13:50.820
Look, no disrespect,

13:50.820 --> 13:54.160
but if I remembered
everyone got on my bus,

13:54.160 --> 13:55.760
I'd quit and go
to Atlantic City.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.330
Does your bus
have security cameras?

13:57.330 --> 13:58.370
We want to see the tapes.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.570
Sure.

13:59.570 --> 14:01.100
Just flash your badges
at Sonia.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.170
She'll get you
what you need.

14:02.170 --> 14:03.700
Thanks.
Thank you.

14:05.140 --> 14:06.340
I guess your Calling's trying

14:06.340 --> 14:08.040
to send us
on a wild-goose chase.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.410
There's always a reason,
Jared.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.780
Look, you don't have to help
if you don't want.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.180
Now I'm curious.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.120
TJ: So, those shadows
Cal sees...

14:19.120 --> 14:20.220
What about them?

14:20.220 --> 14:21.320
What if they're
not supposed

14:21.320 --> 14:23.320
to make us doubt
the Callings?

14:23.320 --> 14:25.330
What if they're
another warning,

14:25.330 --> 14:27.130
like the fire?

14:27.130 --> 14:28.460
About what?

14:28.460 --> 14:30.530
Something terrible
that's coming.

14:30.530 --> 14:32.470
Sir.

14:32.470 --> 14:34.070
Excuse me. Uh...

14:35.770 --> 14:37.170
Here you go.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.110
Thanks, kid.

14:41.110 --> 14:43.180
You raised him well, Dad.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.210
Come on.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.690
The phoenix.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.090
Over there.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.790
So, what now?

14:58.790 --> 15:01.130
I don't know.

15:01.130 --> 15:03.260
Just keep our eyes open.

15:12.670 --> 15:14.040
You know
that gloomy feeling?

15:14.040 --> 15:15.510
Yeah, I feel it, too.

15:15.510 --> 15:17.740
Man on P.A.: Approaching
express train is not in service.

15:17.740 --> 15:20.750
Please stand away
from the platform edge.

15:24.650 --> 15:27.290
Look. Over there.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.190
The guy from the stairs.

15:31.260 --> 15:33.130
Express train
is not in service.

15:33.130 --> 15:35.200
Please stand away
from the platform.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.230
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop!

15:45.340 --> 15:47.570
What the hell?

15:53.810 --> 15:55.550
Best thing about
being stuck in a hospital

15:55.550 --> 15:57.220
is the guilt-free
junk food.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.720
You always had
a sweet tooth.

15:59.720 --> 16:02.260
Should've brought
something for you.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.060
Ah, I'm just glad
you could come today, Mom.

16:04.060 --> 16:06.330
Mm.
What happened?

16:06.330 --> 16:09.260
You were doing so well,
taking care of yourself.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.200
I'm not using, Mom.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.200
I promise.

16:13.200 --> 16:17.370
Then why are you
so sick?

16:17.370 --> 16:19.040
I told you.
I'm -- I'm recovering

16:19.040 --> 16:21.740
from burns and smoke inhalation
from that fire.

16:21.740 --> 16:24.310
Yeah, I-I know.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.110
I'm sorry.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.750
It's just that, um,

16:27.750 --> 16:30.080
it's been a long time now.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.290
You're all I've got.

16:32.290 --> 16:33.520
So I worry.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.520
You don't need
to apologize.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.720
After all the times
I lied to you,

16:36.720 --> 16:38.190
you have
a right to doubt me.

16:38.190 --> 16:41.430
No, I just feel so lucky
to have my son back.

16:41.430 --> 16:46.570
To see you happy
and in love.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.740
I really like Michaela.

16:49.740 --> 16:51.070
Me too.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.240
Mm.

16:54.070 --> 16:56.640
Well, I guess
I better get going

16:56.640 --> 16:59.050
if I'm gonna make it
out there today.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.020
I love you.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.050
Mm.

17:07.050 --> 17:08.560
I love you so much.

17:11.260 --> 17:13.090
I wish
you could come with me.

17:13.090 --> 17:14.530
We'll go again
when I'm better.

17:14.530 --> 17:16.400
Okay.

17:23.100 --> 17:25.440
My sister loved
Jones Beach.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.470
So we go out there every year
to remember her.

17:27.470 --> 17:29.310
That's
a beautiful tradition.

17:29.310 --> 17:31.510
Unfortunately, my IV
doesn't travel further

17:31.510 --> 17:33.680
than the vending machine.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.450
You still haven't told her

17:35.450 --> 17:36.620
what's really going on,
have you?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.220
Why torment her?

17:38.220 --> 17:41.090
Thought I'd wait
till I was on death's door.

17:41.090 --> 17:44.090
Which I might be, judging
by the look on your face.

17:44.090 --> 17:46.190
How bad is it?

17:48.300 --> 17:51.730
Yeah, the MRI results
aren't exactly what I'd hoped.

17:51.730 --> 17:55.140
There's some new damage
to your muscles.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.200
So I'm still freezing
to death.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.240
We are not gonna lose
this fight, okay?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.680
You mean too much
to all of us.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.680
Hey,
you find something?

18:08.680 --> 18:10.580
Yeah, I'm never sitting
on a bus again.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.150
People are disgusting.

18:12.150 --> 18:14.020
Thanks for the PSA.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.390
Any leads
on the shoplifter?

18:15.390 --> 18:16.720
Yeah, we have three kids

18:16.720 --> 18:18.460
who match your description
of the runner.

18:19.790 --> 18:22.200
Yeah, that's him.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.730
Okay.

18:27.330 --> 18:31.170
Alright.
He got off at Franklin High.

18:31.170 --> 18:32.570
Alright, forward me
a screen shot.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.180
I'll call the principal
and send it over for an ID.

18:39.810 --> 18:41.780
So, how was your little
walk down memory lane?

18:41.780 --> 18:43.820
It's good to be friends again.
Thank you for asking.

18:43.820 --> 18:45.450
I don't have many friends
who would infiltrate

18:45.450 --> 18:46.720
a hate group for me.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.320
No, he's a cop.
He's just doing his job.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.690
Yeah, well, that maybe
explains the undercover part,

18:51.690 --> 18:54.660
but that awful haircut --
That's true love.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.500
Okay, let's just forward him
the screen shot.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.030
Mm-hmm.

18:59.130 --> 19:00.600
Ah. Hey.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.540
How's he doing?
He's sleeping.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.170
Just scrapes and bruises.
Nothing serious.

19:04.170 --> 19:06.340
He's lucky you two were
on the platform today.

19:06.340 --> 19:07.410
Any ID?

19:07.410 --> 19:09.480
No ID, no phone.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.740
We put him in the database.

19:10.740 --> 19:12.550
If someone misses him,
they show up.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.080
Alright. Thank you.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.180
Mm-hmm.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.250
And you're sure
he's not a passenger?

19:18.250 --> 19:19.720
Ben: I'm positive.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.790
So, that's it?

19:21.790 --> 19:23.620
We save his life
and have no idea who he is

19:23.620 --> 19:25.190
or why the Callings
led us to him.

19:25.190 --> 19:28.060
Maybe we'll get some answers
when he wakes up.

19:30.230 --> 19:32.970
He was holding that matchbox
when he tried to end it all.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.480
It's a music box.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.060
It's Grace's lullaby.
What?

19:59.060 --> 20:01.060
Grace was singing
this lullaby today.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.060
Where'd she learn it?

20:02.060 --> 20:03.530
Cal.

20:03.530 --> 20:06.700
So the lullaby's got to be
a Calling, too, right?

20:06.700 --> 20:10.170
A subway, a phoenix mosaic,
and a lullaby.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.570
That's a weird puzzle.

20:11.570 --> 20:12.770
The song
was about the seasons.

20:12.770 --> 20:14.570
I can't --
I can't recall the lyrics.

20:14.570 --> 20:16.080
Maybe that's the key.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.340
Cal knows them.
We should talk to him.

20:17.340 --> 20:19.110
Yeah.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.720
He seemed like a nice guy.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.750
Sad he tried
to end his life.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.790
Hey.

20:26.790 --> 20:30.120
We gave him
a second chance.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.660
Now we just need
to figure out why.

20:32.730 --> 20:34.690
It was
just a candy bar.

20:34.690 --> 20:36.830
Right. Well, uh, that excuse
worked this morning

20:36.830 --> 20:39.130
when you forgot to
tell us about the cold
medicine you snatched.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.330
Help me understand something,
Oscar.

20:40.330 --> 20:41.600
Straight A's,

20:41.600 --> 20:43.840
honor student,
and cooks meth?

20:43.840 --> 20:45.370
Meth?

20:45.370 --> 20:47.240
No, no, no.
I-I-I don't cook meth.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.680
I-I don't do drugs, alright?
I'm on the track team.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.880
Okay, well,
it doesn't look like

20:50.880 --> 20:52.250
you have
much of a cold, either.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.450
So do you want
to help us out here?

20:53.450 --> 20:54.750
Please,
you gotta believe me.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.780
I had no idea
those were to make meth.

20:56.780 --> 20:59.790
Mm-hmm. Then you work
for somebody that does.

20:59.790 --> 21:01.090
Hm.
Come on, man.

21:01.090 --> 21:02.720
Don't make us bring you in
on this.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.430
I don't know him.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.660
Alright, it was a JoJo.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.330
A what?

21:08.330 --> 21:11.160
JoJo's Delivery Service?

21:11.160 --> 21:12.800
Like a --
Like a dark Net TaskRabbit.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.240
As if you were explaining it
to your mother...

21:15.240 --> 21:18.140
So, you get a snap of what to
steal and where to drop it off,

21:18.140 --> 21:19.440
and then they Venmo you.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.240
Who are "they"?

21:21.240 --> 21:24.240
Uh, I just know
the handle's Try3.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.580
Okay, so, you took the bus
to the drop-off.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.680
No, the bus is the drop-off.

21:31.450 --> 21:32.820
Ah-ha-ha!

21:32.820 --> 21:35.090
Aha! Oh!
Checkmate!

21:35.090 --> 21:36.560
No mercy for a sick patient,
huh?

21:36.560 --> 21:37.820
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

21:37.820 --> 21:39.230
You should have seen
the tournaments

21:39.230 --> 21:40.430
we had in the cancer ward.

21:40.430 --> 21:41.790
Rematch?

21:41.790 --> 21:43.400
I'm a glutton
for punishment.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.460
Set up the board.

21:45.730 --> 21:47.200
Hey.
Hey.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.270
How you doing?
Getting my butt kicked.

21:49.270 --> 21:51.470
Cal, I need you
to talk to TJ.

21:51.470 --> 21:53.710
We think your lullaby
might be a Calling.

21:53.710 --> 21:55.440
What lullaby?

21:55.440 --> 21:57.840
You know,
the one you sing to Eden.

21:57.840 --> 22:01.780
♪ Frosty winter
into spring ♪

22:01.780 --> 22:06.090
♪ Sunny summer into fall ♪

22:06.090 --> 22:10.360
Both: ♪ I will love you
through them all ♪

22:11.490 --> 22:13.730
How do you know that?

22:13.730 --> 22:16.260
My dad wrote that.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.530
Was he a songwriter?

22:18.530 --> 22:20.200
No.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.740
He just -- He would sing
me and my sister to sleep.

22:23.740 --> 22:27.810
He had a little music box
he used to make up songs to.

22:27.810 --> 22:29.540
No one else would know them.

22:32.350 --> 22:35.380
Zeke, when's the last time
you saw your dad?

22:35.380 --> 22:37.550
He left a few months
after my sister died.

22:37.550 --> 22:39.090
Haven't seen him since.

22:39.090 --> 22:42.090
He's dead for all I know.

22:42.090 --> 22:45.260
Actually...

22:45.260 --> 22:47.260
I think
he might be downstairs.

22:54.020 --> 22:56.150
Told you the Callings
had a plan.

22:56.150 --> 22:57.890
"Let him go."

22:57.890 --> 23:00.060
If I hadn't, then we wouldn't
be onto this bus drop-off

23:00.060 --> 23:01.360
or any of this.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.030
If the Callings
really wanted to help,

23:03.030 --> 23:04.290
they'd lead us
directly to the lab.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.130
Oh, where's the fun
in that?

23:06.130 --> 23:07.630
Fun's gonna be
an ice-cold beer

23:07.630 --> 23:09.630
once we put
these criminals away.

23:09.630 --> 23:12.900
Drea: Hey, so, we got
access to Try3's payment list,

23:12.900 --> 23:14.770
and it matches
most of the bodega thefts

23:14.770 --> 23:16.010
in the five boroughs.

23:16.010 --> 23:17.140
They steal the items,

23:17.140 --> 23:18.840
drop them off on the bus,

23:18.840 --> 23:20.140
and then someone comes
and picks them up.

23:20.140 --> 23:21.680
And most of the payments

23:21.680 --> 23:22.880
were made within
two hours of the theft.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.050
Never making
any direct contact.

23:25.050 --> 23:27.620
So the kids
can't ID the dealers.

23:27.620 --> 23:29.720
It's crafty.
Do we know who Try3 is?

23:29.720 --> 23:31.850
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Jace Baylor.

23:31.850 --> 23:33.790
History of violence,
stint upstate

23:33.790 --> 23:35.790
for possession
and sale of meth.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.860
He was busted for buying
fertilizer in bulk.

23:37.860 --> 23:40.930
Well, it looks like he found a
smarter way to get his supplies.

23:40.930 --> 23:42.930
Didn't take him long. He was
released four months ago.

23:42.930 --> 23:44.330
Just when
the robberies started.

23:44.330 --> 23:45.940
Might be tricky
to find him.

23:45.940 --> 23:47.340
He was evicted
from his last-known address

23:47.340 --> 23:49.000
and hasn't checked in
with his parole officer.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.040
I have a guy in narcotics
who owes me a favor.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.040
I'll see what he knows.
-I'm gonna go check in on Zeke.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.740
I'll text you
if I get an address.

23:55.740 --> 23:57.950
What are we waiting for?
Let's go find your dad.

23:57.950 --> 23:59.280
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea, bud.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.180
Don't you want
to see him?

24:01.180 --> 24:02.820
Let's just say I didn't get
as lucky as you

24:02.820 --> 24:04.320
in the dad department.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.890
Hey, Calamander,

24:05.890 --> 24:08.720
what do you say you come
with me and your sister?

24:08.720 --> 24:10.160
Get us checked in.
We'll wait for you.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.860
Thank you.
Thanks, buddy.

24:12.860 --> 24:14.300
Bye, guys.
See you later.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.670
There has to be a reason

24:17.670 --> 24:19.100
the Calling
brought us to your father.

24:19.100 --> 24:21.600
Calling wasted your time.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.970
My dad made it very clear

24:22.970 --> 24:24.670
he wanted nothing to do
with me years ago.

24:24.670 --> 24:26.810
I think he maybe changed.

24:26.810 --> 24:29.180
I get the feeling
he's got a lot of regrets.

24:29.180 --> 24:30.810
Good.

24:30.810 --> 24:32.010
He should.

24:35.050 --> 24:38.250
You're angry. I get it.

24:38.250 --> 24:41.660
But
he's your dad.

24:41.660 --> 24:42.960
Does he not get
a second chance?

24:42.960 --> 24:44.390
He's not like you, Ben.

24:44.390 --> 24:46.030
Your kid gets hurt,
you pick him up,

24:46.030 --> 24:47.400
you tell him
it's gonna be okay.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.830
My dad dumped all the blame
on me and bailed.

24:50.830 --> 24:54.100
After your sister died?

24:54.100 --> 24:56.170
There's no excuse
for that.

24:58.340 --> 25:00.210
But...

25:00.210 --> 25:02.680
as someone that has
a brand-new baby girl,

25:02.680 --> 25:05.150
I can't imagine
what I would do

25:05.150 --> 25:08.150
if something happened
to her.

25:08.150 --> 25:09.950
You know, grief can make us
do crazy things.

25:09.950 --> 25:12.150
You don't have to tell me
about grief.

25:12.150 --> 25:13.860
I fell apart.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.160
Where was he?

25:15.160 --> 25:16.290
He moved on.

25:16.290 --> 25:18.630
No note. Nothing.

25:18.630 --> 25:19.900
I never saw him again.

25:19.900 --> 25:22.060
And he's a broken man
because of it.

25:22.060 --> 25:26.200
Zeke, he was about
to take his own life.

25:30.710 --> 25:34.280
That's not
my responsibility.

25:34.280 --> 25:38.750
What if
this is your chance

25:38.750 --> 25:41.080
to let go of all
of that hurt and anger?

25:41.080 --> 25:44.650
I'm not gonna spend the little
time I have left on that man.

25:44.650 --> 25:45.990
But you're not doing this
for him.

25:45.990 --> 25:47.090
You're doing this for you.

25:50.860 --> 25:55.160
Maybe it's time
that you forgive

25:55.160 --> 25:57.200
so you can find
some closure.

26:15.220 --> 26:16.990
You're...

26:19.720 --> 26:22.290
You and your dad
were at the subway.

26:22.290 --> 26:26.030
Not my dad,
but, uh, yeah.

26:26.030 --> 26:28.660
How you feeling?

26:28.660 --> 26:30.300
You shouldn't
have saved me.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.770
Don't say that.
It's the truth.

26:35.200 --> 26:39.340
There was a mural
of a phoenix in the subway.

26:39.340 --> 26:42.110
Does that mean anything
to you?

26:42.110 --> 26:45.810
It's a symbol
of rebirth and renewal.

26:45.810 --> 26:47.620
Maybe you got a chance
to try again.

26:47.620 --> 26:49.350
What makes
you think I deserve one?

26:49.350 --> 26:51.990
Everyone does.
What is it to you, anyway?

26:51.990 --> 26:54.160
A lot, actually.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.760
My mother killed herself.

26:58.890 --> 27:02.660
And I would do anything to
be able to see her again.

27:04.630 --> 27:06.200
I'm sorry.

27:08.770 --> 27:11.940
I'm sure someone feels
the same way about you.

27:11.940 --> 27:14.210
Don't you have a family?

27:14.210 --> 27:16.880
They've forgotten about me
by now.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.310
I doubt that.

27:18.310 --> 27:19.780
How do you know
they're not out there

27:19.780 --> 27:21.050
looking for you right now?

27:21.050 --> 27:24.990
'Cause what I did
was unforgivable.

27:24.990 --> 27:28.190
I abandoned
them when they needed me.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.840
Hey, Dad.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.340
Zeke?

28:14.670 --> 28:15.870
I can't believe it.

28:15.870 --> 28:16.940
I can.

28:16.940 --> 28:18.210
Zeke needed this.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.640
Just what the doctor ordered.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.980
-Hey!
-Hey.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.740
I didn't expect to see you
up and around so soon.

28:54.740 --> 28:57.050
Mm.
Mm. Mm.

28:57.050 --> 28:58.780
Are treatments
getting easier?

28:58.780 --> 29:00.320
No, I just had to...

29:02.550 --> 29:05.650
My dad's downstairs.

29:05.650 --> 29:06.960
How is that possible?

29:06.960 --> 29:08.190
I thought
you guys lost touch.

29:08.190 --> 29:09.930
A Calling.

29:09.930 --> 29:11.330
I don't know how or why,

29:11.330 --> 29:14.230
but it -- it led
your brother and TJ to him.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.600
They brought him here.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.670
Wow.

29:16.670 --> 29:18.200
Yeah.

29:18.200 --> 29:21.340
How --
How was it seeing him?

29:21.340 --> 29:25.340
I've carried
so much anger and hurt.

29:25.340 --> 29:29.340
But just now
he seemed small.

29:29.340 --> 29:31.080
Just a sad old man.

29:31.080 --> 29:33.680
Are you gonna
see him again?

29:33.680 --> 29:36.320
We're gonna take a train
out to Chloe's beach.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.050
Give us a chance
to at least talk.

29:38.050 --> 29:39.860
Wait. Right now?

29:39.860 --> 29:42.060
What -- What about
your treatment?

29:42.060 --> 29:44.660
I'm done.

29:44.660 --> 29:45.930
I'm stopping the treatment.

29:45.930 --> 29:47.600
Uh, what do you mean,
you're done?

29:47.600 --> 29:48.800
If you don't keep going,
then --

29:48.800 --> 29:50.870
Michaela.

29:50.870 --> 29:54.340
I've been staying alive,
but I haven't been living.

29:54.340 --> 29:56.670
I don't want to spend
my last days hooked up to tubes,

29:56.670 --> 29:59.210
getting my skin scraped off,
trapped inside this place.

29:59.210 --> 30:02.710
I want to spend it with you,
in your arms.

30:02.710 --> 30:03.980
Yeah, but I don't understand.

30:03.980 --> 30:05.380
You -- You went
and saw your dad,

30:05.380 --> 30:07.150
and now you're just gonna
give up?

30:07.150 --> 30:09.650
No, no, it just...

30:09.650 --> 30:12.890
gave me some clarity.

30:12.890 --> 30:14.190
Believe me,
the last thing I want to do

30:14.190 --> 30:15.660
is cause you pain.

30:15.660 --> 30:16.860
It's why I've been
fighting so hard.

30:16.860 --> 30:18.290
We're gonna find you
a cure, Zeke.

30:18.290 --> 30:20.830
And I hope to God
I'm there to take it.

30:23.700 --> 30:26.270
But right now, I need to live
every day like it's my last.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.810
Hey. I know.

30:31.970 --> 30:33.080
I'm lucky.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.340
I've -- I've been able

30:34.340 --> 30:37.110
to make peace
with everyone I needed to.

30:37.110 --> 30:40.380
I feel closure.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.780
I'm ready.

30:45.220 --> 30:48.020
I just need you to be.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.990
Let me go.

31:14.980 --> 31:16.690
Oh, great.

31:16.690 --> 31:18.290
Tim, my badge isn't working.
Can you let me in?

31:18.290 --> 31:19.860
I'm sorry, Dr. Bahl,

31:19.860 --> 31:21.160
but I'm afraid we have
to ask you to leave.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.960
What?
Is this some kind of drill?

31:22.960 --> 31:24.060
Luisa:
Your hospital privileges

31:24.060 --> 31:25.330
have been revoked.

31:25.330 --> 31:28.230
That's, uh...

31:28.230 --> 31:30.130
That's not possible.

31:30.130 --> 31:32.300
My research is, uh, in there.
How am I supposed to do my job?

31:32.300 --> 31:33.970
Please, if you'll come
with us...

31:33.970 --> 31:35.300
Hey.
Hey, you don't understand.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.740
People's lives
are at stake here.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.140
Please, Dr. Bahl.

31:38.140 --> 31:40.680
Tim,
who authorized this?

31:40.680 --> 31:42.680
Who authorized this?!

31:42.680 --> 31:44.310
Jared:
You've been awfully quiet.

31:44.310 --> 31:45.810
Are you okay?

31:45.810 --> 31:47.650
Yeah. You sure
this is the right place?

31:47.650 --> 31:49.120
Yeah.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.190
My boy in narcotics says
Jace has been crashing here

31:51.190 --> 31:53.120
with a brother.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.920
You hungry?

31:54.920 --> 31:57.260
Got you a pastrami and rye
from that hole-in-the-wall place

31:57.260 --> 31:58.890
we used to love to go to.

32:02.200 --> 32:05.200
What is this?

32:05.200 --> 32:07.370
A sandwich.
Thank you.

32:07.370 --> 32:11.640
Um,
it's my favorite sandwich.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.310
And you've gotten on this case
with me, and...

32:14.310 --> 32:16.780
You asked for help.

32:19.350 --> 32:21.980
Look, J, I...

32:21.980 --> 32:25.350
I'm beyond grateful
for the risks

32:25.350 --> 32:29.060
that you took to protect me
and for saving Zeke's life.

32:30.860 --> 32:34.830
But I'm with him now, and...

32:34.830 --> 32:35.930
I love him.

32:38.370 --> 32:41.270
Mick,
you're way off base here.

32:41.270 --> 32:42.640
Am I?

32:42.640 --> 32:45.810
I know you're with Zeke.

32:45.810 --> 32:47.780
And I'm happy for you.

32:49.310 --> 32:53.050
Maybe that's an overstatement,
but I've accepted it.

32:53.050 --> 32:54.280
And, yeah, you're right.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.880
I did want to work this case
with you,

32:55.880 --> 32:59.420
but not 'cause I want
to get back with you.

32:59.420 --> 33:03.230
It's 'cause I miss
having you in my life.

33:03.230 --> 33:07.660
I can handle
not being with you anymore.

33:07.660 --> 33:11.770
I can't handle
not having you as a friend.

33:11.770 --> 33:13.600
Me too.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.100
I mean, who knows?

33:15.100 --> 33:18.140
Maybe after all this,
Zeke and I will be friends.

33:20.110 --> 33:22.980
What?

33:22.980 --> 33:24.380
He hates me, doesn't he?

33:24.380 --> 33:26.310
Of course he does.

33:26.310 --> 33:27.950
No.

33:31.020 --> 33:34.990
It's just that he might not
be around for much longer.

33:34.990 --> 33:36.830
What do you mean?

33:36.830 --> 33:39.690
He's not being treated
for burns, Jared.

33:39.690 --> 33:41.860
He's dying.

33:41.860 --> 33:43.400
Being back has a cost,

33:43.400 --> 33:47.100
and, uh, however long
we were gone is --

33:47.100 --> 33:49.840
That's how long
we have left to live.

33:51.770 --> 33:53.180
Wait, you have this, too?

33:53.180 --> 33:55.140
Yeah.

33:55.140 --> 33:56.850
The Callings
made that pretty clear.

33:56.850 --> 33:58.410
How -- How can you
even be sure that --

33:58.410 --> 34:00.080
We are, Jared.
It happened to Griffin.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.680
It's happening to Zeke.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.080
How is this
even possible, Mick?

34:03.080 --> 34:05.050
How is any of this
possible, Jared?!

34:05.050 --> 34:07.090
How is it possible that...

34:09.830 --> 34:11.630
...Zeke's telling me
to let him go?

34:11.630 --> 34:13.830
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
So the Calling was about Zeke?

34:13.830 --> 34:15.600
I don't know.
I don't -- I don't...

34:15.600 --> 34:17.970
I don't know. I'm...

34:17.970 --> 34:20.140
more confused
than I've ever been.

34:20.140 --> 34:22.240
I'm just...

34:22.240 --> 34:25.340
praying that we m-make this
meth-ring bust

34:25.340 --> 34:27.210
so that I know that that's
what the Callings meant.

34:27.210 --> 34:29.340
Mick, I...

34:29.340 --> 34:31.610
Hey. Hold on. Look.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.050
-That's the bus driver.
-He's the courier.

34:36.050 --> 34:37.820
He's making a drop
is my guess.

34:39.720 --> 34:42.760
1-29. 85 in progress
at 272 Barnell.

34:42.760 --> 34:43.990
Requesting backup.

34:43.990 --> 34:46.390
We got to get in there
before he bails.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.970
Gas company!
You have a leak!

35:04.310 --> 35:05.810
Clear!

35:12.950 --> 35:15.190

Down on the ground!
Get over.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.200
Over here right now! Pole.

36:05.270 --> 36:06.810
You don't want to do this.

36:06.810 --> 36:09.040
Jace, shut up. Yeah,
I know exactly who you are.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.310
In fact, I came especially
to see you.

36:11.310 --> 36:15.220
Ah. Well, now we've been
introduced, you best walk away.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.620
Let him go.

36:17.620 --> 36:20.260
You know there'll be hell to
pay, don't you, pretty lady?

36:20.260 --> 36:22.190
The pain I'll bring
down on you,

36:22.190 --> 36:24.160
a holy vengeance like nothing
you've ever seen before.

36:24.160 --> 36:27.060
Shut up. You threatening
me is only gonna make
it worse for you, okay?

36:27.060 --> 36:28.630
This is bigger
than both of us.

36:28.630 --> 36:30.330
Let him go.

36:30.330 --> 36:33.370
Let him go! Let him go!

36:33.370 --> 36:35.140
No!

36:35.140 --> 36:36.970
Jace Baylor, you are
under arrest for possession

36:36.970 --> 36:38.670
of an illegal substance
with intent to sell.

36:38.670 --> 36:40.180
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:40.180 --> 36:41.840
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

36:41.840 --> 36:44.550
in a court of law. Do you
understand these rights?

36:49.150 --> 36:52.090
Scoop of chocolate
on the bottom,

36:52.090 --> 36:55.020
mint on top, with...

36:55.020 --> 36:57.930
sprinkles.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.130
I mean, I know a nursing mother
needs her calcium.

37:05.130 --> 37:07.800
But sprinkles?
What is the occasion?

37:07.800 --> 37:10.570
Second chances.

37:10.570 --> 37:12.970
You know, today reminded me
that I haven't...

37:12.970 --> 37:15.740
exactly been making
the most of mine.

37:15.740 --> 37:18.180
So, starting now...

37:18.180 --> 37:21.720
watch out.

37:23.180 --> 37:25.690
-Well, I like the sound of that.

37:25.690 --> 37:27.620
But what have you done
with my husband?

37:29.790 --> 37:31.990
I've just been trying so hard
to make sense of everything,

37:31.990 --> 37:33.690
and I've gotten nowhere.

37:33.690 --> 37:36.160
Meanwhile,
the Callings keep --

37:36.160 --> 37:38.730
keep doing
these amazing things.

37:38.730 --> 37:41.240
Yeah, they do.
So now what?

37:42.740 --> 37:45.870
Do what the Callings have
wanted us to do all along --

37:45.870 --> 37:47.840
just listen.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.180
Follow and listen.

37:49.180 --> 37:51.650
That's where we're gonna
find our answers.

37:54.210 --> 37:56.720
So...

37:56.720 --> 37:58.720
does that mean no more
late nights in the garage?

37:58.720 --> 38:00.350
Yeah, I better lock it up

38:00.350 --> 38:02.660
before my skeptical mind
rebels.

38:05.330 --> 38:07.190
We're gonna
get you back, then.

38:07.190 --> 38:08.760
Are you kidding?

38:08.760 --> 38:10.230
Come on.

38:10.230 --> 38:14.870
I am not missing another
milestone with my kids.

38:14.870 --> 38:17.040
Hi!
Hi!

38:17.040 --> 38:18.270
Hi!

38:20.240 --> 38:21.940
Hey, baby girl.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.080
There's your smile.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.850
That's my girl.

38:28.850 --> 38:30.780
Hey.

38:38.130 --> 38:41.930
So, uh, this thing
Zeke has --

38:41.930 --> 38:44.300
a-and you.

38:44.300 --> 38:45.700
There's no cure?

38:45.700 --> 38:47.600
Not for lack of trying.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.610
Something else wrong?

38:52.610 --> 38:56.280
At the bust, I got a Calling
that told me to "let him go."

38:58.050 --> 38:59.680
And I didn't.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.620
Why would it ask you
something like that?

39:01.620 --> 39:02.820
Who knows.

39:02.820 --> 39:04.550
Maybe it's talking
about Zeke again.

39:04.550 --> 39:07.250
But I'm gonna lose my mind.

39:07.250 --> 39:09.120
Please don't.
That'd be terrible timing

39:09.120 --> 39:10.960
now that we're
finally friends again.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.000
So what happens now?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.970
I don't know.

39:17.970 --> 39:21.030
I've never defied
a Calling before.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.970
I think you made
the right choice.

39:38.290 --> 39:41.160
Hey.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.790
I wasn't expecting
you'd be home yet.

39:42.790 --> 39:44.790
Mm-hmm.

39:45.860 --> 39:47.660
Ooh. You're freezing.

39:47.660 --> 39:49.300
It was cold at the beach.

39:50.630 --> 39:51.930
How'd it go
with your dad?

39:51.930 --> 39:55.070
It was tough,
but we muddled through.

39:55.070 --> 39:59.310
I don't know -- I don't know
what -- what comes of it, but...

39:59.310 --> 40:02.040
maybe now neither of us
will die with regrets.

40:05.850 --> 40:08.180
Mick, the puppy-dog eyes
are not changing my mind.

40:11.020 --> 40:12.920
I know.

40:12.920 --> 40:15.220
But I don't have to agree
with you or the Callings

40:15.220 --> 40:16.620
or any of it.

40:16.620 --> 40:19.160
I didn't expect you to.

40:20.930 --> 40:25.900
Pretty much my entire life has
been about regret and sadness.

40:25.900 --> 40:29.240
But I don't want
to end it like that.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.340
I want to go out
on my terms...

40:32.340 --> 40:34.740
with the love of my life,

40:34.740 --> 40:37.310
making one more memory
I can take with me.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.310

41:10.340 --> 41:11.880
There we go.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.050
Did Zeke and his dad
make up yet?

41:14.050 --> 41:15.920
They're working on it.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.780
And how about you, bud?

41:17.780 --> 41:20.120
Have you seen any of those
scary shadows lately?

41:20.120 --> 41:23.360
No. Why do you think?

41:23.360 --> 41:26.190
I don't know.

41:26.190 --> 41:28.400
But I bet we're gonna
figure it out.

41:28.400 --> 41:32.030
As your wise grandma
always said...

41:32.030 --> 41:35.240
all things work together
for good.

41:36.970 --> 41:39.140
Sleep tight.

41:43.740 --> 41:45.910
-Love you.
-Love you, too.
