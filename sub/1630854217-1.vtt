you haven't been here

08:12.095 --> 08:12.863
What?

08:12.898 --> 08:13.930
15?

08:13.965 --> 08:14.700
- Almost.

08:14.735 --> 08:16.130
30.

08:16.165 --> 08:19.837
I was, uh, I was
younger than Cassie.

08:19.872 --> 08:22.235
- There you go, I rest my case.

08:23.810 --> 08:25.612
- Summer's nice but fall

08:27.110 --> 08:30.144
is when this town
really comes to life.

08:32.148 --> 08:33.818

09:01.914 --> 09:02.946
- This place is nice, babe.

09:04.246 --> 09:05.817
- Yeah.

09:05.852 --> 09:09.249
My brother did a job
of keeping up with it.

09:11.220 --> 09:13.253
You know what?

09:13.288 --> 09:16.696
I should call him, let
him know we're here.

09:18.733 --> 09:19.358
Oh, shit.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.636
- Something wrong?

09:22.671 --> 09:25.606
- Yeah, one bar of
service, barely that.

09:41.921 --> 09:43.085
- So you want me to help you

09:43.120 --> 09:46.121
bring some of your
things inside?

09:46.156 --> 09:48.959
- I can take care
of myself, thanks.

09:52.228 --> 09:54.261
- Hey, hey, Derek.

09:54.296 --> 09:55.966
Yeah, it's me, we,
we just got here.

09:56.001 --> 09:58.067
The place looks great, man.

09:59.972 --> 10:00.707
What, what?

10:02.975 --> 10:06.339
The key, I thought, I
thought you left one.

10:13.755 --> 10:14.554
Derek, you're,
you're breaking up.

10:14.589 --> 10:16.921
You're saying
something in the house.

10:19.123 --> 10:19.957
- Cassie!

10:27.032 --> 10:28.229
- It's a fucking cat.

10:28.264 --> 10:29.428
A goddamn cat.

10:31.069 --> 10:34.774
- Uh, so your uncle says,
"That there's a cat inside,

10:34.809 --> 10:36.006
and there's gotta
be a hole somewhere

10:36.041 --> 10:37.238
where it keeps getting in"

10:37.273 --> 10:40.340
but, uh, guess it's
better than a raccoon.

10:51.155 --> 10:51.758
It's okay.

10:53.355 --> 10:54.420
- I'm trying.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.093
Like I'm really trying.

10:57.128 --> 10:58.325
- I know, I know.

11:02.067 --> 11:05.266
Remember what the doctor said,
"We'd have to be patient."

11:05.301 --> 11:09.468
"This will take a while,
it's a huge change for her."

11:10.977 --> 11:13.780
- It's a huge change
for all of us.

11:16.114 --> 11:17.014
- Yeah, yeah.

11:23.187 --> 11:23.988
- It's nice.

11:25.255 --> 11:26.419
- Yeah.

11:26.454 --> 11:28.828
Sure brings back memories.

11:34.363 --> 11:36.836
Oh, my God, we might not
need cellphones after all.

11:38.499 --> 11:40.103
We have dial tone.

11:44.142 --> 11:45.746
- Found my bedroom.

11:50.918 --> 11:54.282
- So we're gonna be cozy
in for a little bit,

11:55.857 --> 11:58.858
but I think it's good for us.

11:58.893 --> 12:01.025
Hey, if you wanna get the rest
of your stuff from the car,

12:01.060 --> 12:04.490
go ahead and do that
while we get dinner ready.

12:04.525 --> 12:07.064
- What do you have planned?

12:07.099 --> 12:07.966
- You'll see.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.002
Dinner is served.

12:15.239 --> 12:17.536
- So this, this is your plan.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.405
- Yeah.

12:19.441 --> 12:21.111
All those years in the city

12:21.146 --> 12:24.576
you never had yourself a
good ol' American hotdog?

12:24.611 --> 12:26.886
- I was a vegetarian
for most of it.

12:26.921 --> 12:28.250
- What happened?

12:28.285 --> 12:29.548
- Pardon?

12:29.583 --> 12:31.891
- I said, "What happened?"

12:31.926 --> 12:35.059
Why aren't you a
vegetarian anymore?

12:35.094 --> 12:36.489
- I don't know.

12:36.524 --> 12:39.932
I just tried a few things
and then I stopped.

12:41.529 --> 12:42.968
- Just stopped.

12:44.301 --> 12:47.203
- Cassie, you
can leave her alone.

12:47.238 --> 12:48.435
- What?

12:48.470 --> 12:50.503
Just trying to get
to know her better.

12:50.538 --> 12:51.845
Right, Sarah?

12:54.344 --> 12:56.179
- I'm serious, knock it off.

12:56.214 --> 12:57.378
- This whole thing's bullshit.

12:57.413 --> 12:59.083
- No, you know what?

13:00.383 --> 13:02.614
This whole thing is for you.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.220
- For me?

13:04.255 --> 13:06.189
Oh, yeah, that's funny,

13:06.224 --> 13:08.862

reason why we're here

- Pretty much.

18:27.644 --> 18:28.841
Cheers.

18:28.876 --> 18:29.776
Clinky.

18:29.811 --> 18:32.152
- Now we're official friends.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.948
This town isn't close
enough to the ocean

18:36.983 --> 18:38.752
or even Lake Ontario
for that matter

18:38.787 --> 18:41.689
to make it anyone's worth while.

18:41.724 --> 18:43.757
So why do people come here?

18:45.761 --> 18:48.729
To hunt, to look at
the leaves, right?

18:50.667 --> 18:52.304
That's pretty much it.

18:54.374 --> 18:56.539
- Well, that sucks.

18:56.574 --> 18:58.244
- No, it's not all bad.

18:58.279 --> 18:59.378
I mean it's quiet.

19:01.414 --> 19:04.712
- So what do you
guys do for fun around here?

19:04.747 --> 19:06.714
- You're looking at it.

19:06.749 --> 19:07.781
Mostly get fucked up.

19:09.488 --> 19:11.620
- I guess that's true anywhere.

19:11.655 --> 19:13.358
You see where I come from

19:13.393 --> 19:16.691
we check out old buildings,
blown off factories,

19:16.726 --> 19:18.495
urban exploring, you know.

19:18.530 --> 19:21.498
- Hmm, I've seen
photos like that.

19:21.533 --> 19:23.467
We don't have anything
like that here.

19:23.502 --> 19:24.996
- No haunted cemeteries?

19:25.031 --> 19:27.603
Maybe an old barn or something.

19:31.279 --> 19:34.445
There's gotta be a
place around here.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.744
- There is the McKinley house.

19:36.779 --> 19:39.285
- Sorry.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.418
- I mean it's not
something that-

19:40.453 --> 19:41.287
- Anna.

19:45.689 --> 19:47.293
- You're right, I probably
shouldn't have said anything.

19:47.328 --> 19:50.659
- Hey, come on,
guys, that's no fun.

19:50.694 --> 19:51.627
- It's just a legend.

19:51.662 --> 19:52.727
- Anna.
- Tucker.

19:55.534 --> 19:57.864
It's just this old house
on the outskirts of town.

19:57.899 --> 20:00.669
Same family's lived there
for like a hundred years.

20:00.704 --> 20:02.803
- People around here don't
really like to talk about it.

20:02.838 --> 20:04.805
Kinda bad vibes, you know?

20:06.611 --> 20:07.775
- A brother and sister
live there with their mom.

20:07.810 --> 20:10.283
They don't come
around here much.

20:10.318 --> 20:10.943
They do,

20:14.355 --> 20:15.717
they're creepy.

20:15.752 --> 20:18.357
- Did anything happen?

20:21.362 --> 20:22.361
- All right.

20:36.476 --> 20:39.873
- They're from
all over the state.

20:42.878 --> 20:43.712
Are these-
- But nobody

20:43.747 --> 20:45.318
can prove anything.

20:46.684 --> 20:47.848
Hell, nobody even really knows

20:47.883 --> 20:49.586
if they're still in the house.

20:49.621 --> 20:53.623
But there have been rumors
of kidnapping, slavery, and-

20:53.658 --> 20:54.459
- Murder.

20:57.794 --> 20:59.332
- Where is it?

20:59.367 --> 21:00.960
- What?

21:00.995 --> 21:01.796
- Where is it?

21:01.831 --> 21:04.667
I wanna go check it out.

21:04.702 --> 21:06.603
- Are you listening?

21:06.638 --> 21:08.770
This is serious.

21:08.805 --> 21:11.938
- Come on, guys, every town
has a local legend like this.

21:11.973 --> 21:12.939
They're all bullshit.

21:12.974 --> 21:14.446
- No, this is different.

21:14.481 --> 21:17.680
This girl just went missing.

21:17.715 --> 21:20.683
She was visiting just like you,
never been heard from again.

21:20.718 --> 21:22.916
- And that could be anything.

21:25.151 --> 21:28.119
Well, I appreciate your ghost
stories but I gotta roll.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.088
I gotta find this house
while it's still dark.

21:30.123 --> 21:30.957
- Cassie.

21:32.598 --> 21:33.927
- I don't think there's
too many road around here,

21:33.962 --> 21:35.731
I'm pretty sure I can find it.

21:35.766 --> 21:37.502
- Don't be stupid.

21:37.537 --> 21:38.668
- It's not safe.

21:39.968 --> 21:41.671
- I can handle myself.

21:41.706 --> 21:42.540
Thanks.

21:46.106 --> 21:49.745
Unless, you guys wanna
come, get it over with.

21:53.487 --> 21:56.851
I'll probably be
bored with it anyways.

21:56.886 --> 21:57.687
Up to you.

22:04.025 --> 22:05.431
- Let's just
show her where it is.

22:05.466 --> 22:08.533
She can get her picture,
and we can get out.

22:13.936 --> 22:16.442
- There it is.

22:16.477 --> 22:18.708
The McKinley house.

22:18.743 --> 22:21.678
- I can't see anything in there.

22:21.713 --> 22:25.451
- There aren't any
cars in the driveway.

22:25.486 --> 22:28.685
- Where would they be
this late at night?

22:32.658 --> 22:34.053
- Whoa, hey, hey.

22:34.088 --> 22:35.956
You're not going in, are you?

22:35.991 --> 22:38.662
- I just wanna check it out.

22:38.697 --> 22:39.531
Promise.

22:43.636 --> 22:45.163
- This was a mistake.

22:47.508 --> 22:48.474
- It'll be fine.

22:54.878 --> 22:56.746
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

22:56.781 --> 22:58.176
Okay, now let's go.

23:01.753 --> 23:03.786
Cassie, I meant leave.

23:07.825 --> 23:09.693
- Man, this is creepy.

23:09.728 --> 23:11.926
- Yeah, I told you.

23:22.510 --> 23:23.872
- What do you see?

23:23.907 --> 23:25.874
- It's dark, I can't tell.

23:34.115 --> 23:36.115
- Cassie.

23:36.150 --> 23:37.215
- Oh, my God.

23:50.098 --> 23:51.669
Hell are you doing?

23:54.234 --> 23:55.068
Oh, shit.

23:58.304 --> 24:02.548
Can't let
her go by herself.

24:09.216 --> 24:09.984
Oh, gosh.

24:21.734 --> 24:23.833
- Oh, this place reeks.

24:23.868 --> 24:24.702
Oh, God.

24:46.594 --> 24:47.692
- All right, let's
take a look around

24:47.727 --> 24:49.925
and get the fuck out of here.

25:15.282 --> 25:18.019
- You say you don't see much
of the McKinleys, right?

25:18.054 --> 25:19.658
- Yeah.

25:19.693 --> 25:21.792
- Well, this explains
how they're living.

25:21.827 --> 25:22.661
- Hm?

25:27.767 --> 25:30.801
Edna McKinley, she's
been dead for years.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.936
- Who's she?

25:33.971 --> 25:36.334
- She's the grandmother.

25:36.369 --> 25:40.305
- What the hell?
- Can you believe this?

25:40.340 --> 25:41.911
Frickin' criminals.

25:45.411 --> 25:47.345
All right, let's get
the hell out of here.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.050
There's nothin' to see here.

25:49.085 --> 25:50.282
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:50.317 --> 25:53.186
Hey, whoa, Cassie, come on.

25:53.221 --> 25:55.287
Fuck, no, absolutely not.

25:57.060 --> 25:59.291
- Are you kidding me?

26:05.332 --> 26:06.232
- Oh, my gosh.
- What the hell

26:06.267 --> 26:07.904
did you get me into, Tucker?

26:07.939 --> 26:09.202
- I didn't
want to come.

26:09.237 --> 26:11.072
- Yes, you did.

26:12.339 --> 26:14.042
- Oh, this is unreal.

26:19.885 --> 26:21.687
- What the
hell is that smell?

26:21.722 --> 26:23.249
- I don't know.

26:23.284 --> 26:25.383
- Oh, it's so bad.

26:29.763 --> 26:30.729
- What's this?

26:33.701 --> 26:34.392
- Hey, hey.

26:37.771 --> 26:38.770
She's crazy.

26:55.382 --> 26:56.216
- Guys.

26:59.023 --> 26:59.989
What the hell?

27:03.324 --> 27:04.224
Oh, my God.

27:06.327 --> 27:08.833
- They're into some sick shit.

27:26.017 --> 27:27.049
- Guys.

27:29.889 --> 27:32.252
- Please don't hurt me.

27:33.794 --> 27:35.321
- Oh, my God.

27:35.356 --> 27:36.861
- What's the matter?

27:36.896 --> 27:39.391
You didn't like meeting Momma?

27:39.426 --> 27:42.130
- That was her.

27:42.165 --> 27:42.999
- Yeah.
- Ah.

27:43.034 --> 27:44.330
- Who?

27:44.365 --> 27:46.739
- That's uh, Molly, she-

27:46.774 --> 27:47.872
- Fuck you!

27:47.907 --> 27:50.336
- She's been missing for months.

27:50.371 --> 27:51.205
- No.

28:00.546 --> 28:01.380
- God.

28:04.121 --> 28:04.757
- Look.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.993
- God.
- Oh, my God.

28:10.028 --> 28:11.159
It's all of 'em.

28:14.428 --> 28:15.328
- Oh, shit.

28:20.071 --> 28:22.874
- You best check
that van down by the road.

28:22.909 --> 28:23.809
I'm right behind you.

28:23.844 --> 28:25.404
- All right.
- Shit.

28:25.439 --> 28:26.372
Shit.

28:39.486 --> 28:41.255
- Oh, god.

28:48.935 --> 28:52.101
Fucking varmints.

28:55.502 --> 28:56.336
May!

29:10.957 --> 29:11.791
- Guys.

29:14.323 --> 29:15.157
Guys.

29:17.491 --> 29:19.359
I think now's our chance.

29:23.431 --> 29:25.035
Okay.
- Go, go.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.504
Okay, I don't see
anyone, let's go.

29:32.539 --> 29:35.540
- Different directions,
and meet at the van.

29:46.256 --> 29:46.892
- Shit.

30:51.123 --> 30:52.155
- Come on.

30:52.190 --> 30:53.123
- Oh, shit!

30:53.158 --> 30:54.520
- Hurry, hurry, come on!

30:54.555 --> 30:57.523
Oh My God

30:57.558 --> 30:59.096
- Lucky bugger you.

31:01.463 --> 31:02.594
- Where is she?

31:02.629 --> 31:04.431
Come on, come on, come on!

31:05.973 --> 31:07.137
Stay down!

31:08.107 --> 31:09.469
- Oh, God.

31:09.504 --> 31:10.635
- Get in, hurry.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go,

31:10.670 --> 31:12.945
go, go, go, come on, go, go.

31:25.190 --> 31:27.960
- Don't
worry, I marked it.

31:50.149 --> 31:53.084
- Good news is the
bullet just grazed me.

31:53.119 --> 31:56.615
And the bleeding stopped,
so I'm not gonna die.

31:58.718 --> 32:01.389
- Of course you're
not gonna die.

32:01.424 --> 32:02.423
Don't say that.

32:04.757 --> 32:05.558
- Joking.

32:07.331 --> 32:08.264
- I don't
know how you can joke

32:08.299 --> 32:10.629
after what we just went through.

32:12.303 --> 32:13.665
- I know, I'm sorry.

32:15.570 --> 32:17.108
- What do we do?

32:19.772 --> 32:22.146
- I know what I'm gonna do.

32:22.181 --> 32:25.578
I'm gonna go home, pop a bottle
of whiskey, and pass out.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.762
- Guys, we
have to call someone.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.632
- You don't get it.

32:46.667 --> 32:49.734
Somethin's up with this
town and that family.

32:49.769 --> 32:51.406
It's not just a rumor anymore,

32:51.441 --> 32:54.607
and for all we know
everyone's in on it.

32:54.642 --> 32:58.281
I mean how do get
away with all of that?

32:58.316 --> 33:00.151
We can't trust anyone.

33:01.088 --> 33:03.220
- Yeah, he's right.

33:03.255 --> 33:06.256
You don't wanna mess
with these people.

33:59.311 --> 34:00.112
Cassie!

34:04.646 --> 34:08.285
Anything, anything
you'd like to tell me?

34:08.320 --> 34:09.484
- Dad.

34:09.519 --> 34:11.750
- You can, you can be honest.

34:11.785 --> 34:14.885
As a matter of fact
I really need you

34:14.920 --> 34:16.854
to be honest right now.

34:19.166 --> 34:21.463
- I, I don't know what happened.

34:21.498 --> 34:23.663
- You don't know.

34:23.698 --> 34:24.532
- No.

34:26.437 --> 34:29.900
- You come home in the
middle of the night

34:29.935 --> 34:31.902
with a gunshot in the van,

34:31.937 --> 34:33.838
and you don't know
what happened.

34:33.873 --> 34:35.609
- I don't know.

34:35.644 --> 34:39.184
I met some kids my
age, it was nothing.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.482
- Honey, we should
at least consider-

34:40.517 --> 34:42.154
- Look, I'm horrified.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.552
I'm horrified.

34:44.587 --> 34:45.553
- Dad, really.

34:47.359 --> 34:51.889
- Honey, she says she
doesn't know what happened,

34:51.924 --> 34:54.694
and she obviously
doesn't know, okay?

34:54.729 --> 34:55.530
I believe her.

34:55.565 --> 34:57.169
- Fine.

34:57.204 --> 34:58.137
Fine, fine.

35:15.651 --> 35:16.551
- Oh, shit.

35:35.671 --> 35:37.440
- Bones creaky.

35:37.475 --> 35:38.936
Good afternoon.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.675
- Hey, uh, thanks
for coming out, Sheriff,

35:41.710 --> 35:43.314
especially on such short notice.

35:43.349 --> 35:45.811
- Hey, it's all part of the job.

35:46.979 --> 35:48.880
Nice spread out here.

35:48.915 --> 35:50.189
- Yeah.

35:54.492 --> 35:55.491
- Hmm.

35:55.526 --> 35:56.360
- Yeah.

35:58.023 --> 36:00.496
So my daughter she, uh, she
took the van out last night,

36:00.531 --> 36:02.927
and, uh, says nothing happened.

36:05.536 --> 36:06.964
- Teenagers.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.307
- Well, I do believe her.

36:10.937 --> 36:11.771
- Hm.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.005
Well, we do have our share

36:15.040 --> 36:17.975
of issues out here,
Mr. Vanderbilt.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.043
Couple labs out in the woods.

36:19.078 --> 36:22.881
I'm sure you've seen that
on Discovery Channel.

36:22.916 --> 36:24.586
Fact of the matter is,

36:24.621 --> 36:26.357
it was probably someone
doing some night hunting,

36:26.392 --> 36:28.425
which of course is illegal.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.331
- So you don't think anybody

36:33.366 --> 36:36.532
was trying to send a
message or something?

36:36.567 --> 36:38.600
- And why would you think that?

36:38.635 --> 36:39.799
Do you have reason
to believe somebody

36:39.834 --> 36:42.736
would wanna hurt
you or your family?

36:42.771 --> 36:45.508
- I mean no, not,
probably nothing.

36:48.348 --> 36:50.744
- Well, uh, you better tell me.

36:57.016 --> 36:58.884
- My daughter Cassie, she, uh,

36:58.919 --> 37:00.050
she got in trouble in the city,

37:00.085 --> 37:03.328
and nothing, nothing major,

37:03.363 --> 37:07.794
but, uh, there was some
bad apples in her group.

37:07.829 --> 37:09.026
- Huh.

head on straight.

37:15.705 --> 37:17.408
- Yeah, I can see.

37:18.642 --> 37:22.006
Well, I suppose somebody
could have followed you

37:22.041 --> 37:24.580
all the way from
Detroit up here.

37:26.452 --> 37:29.486
I'll file a report,

37:29.521 --> 37:31.356
Do you, uh, you carry?

37:32.656 --> 37:33.820
- No.

37:33.855 --> 37:35.987
- Well, uh, I'd change that.

37:39.058 --> 37:41.597
There's some tough
types up here.

37:43.436 --> 37:46.734
If you see anybody doing
anything they shouldn't be

37:46.769 --> 37:49.308
just leave 'em
be, call me, okay?

37:52.808 --> 37:53.774
- Yeah.

37:55.712 --> 37:58.812

37:58.847 --> 37:59.681
Take care.

38:32.881 --> 38:34.353
- Well, how'd it go?

38:36.181 --> 38:38.885
- I mean, it went good I guess.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.118
Uh, he said, "He's
gonna help us,

38:41.153 --> 38:44.660
but there's only
so much he can do."

38:44.695 --> 38:45.529
- Yeah.

38:46.994 --> 38:50.600
- I'm gonna go to town and,

If we keep this up, Vinny,
he's gonna come calling.

44:18.028 --> 44:21.227

44:21.262 --> 44:24.263
He could be on his way already.

44:24.298 --> 44:26.738

Tucker something.

44:31.404 --> 44:34.042
He lives with his
grandma off 54.

44:34.077 --> 44:37.210

44:37.245 --> 44:39.443

48:19.566 --> 48:21.269
Then how'd you get this?

48:27.277 --> 48:30.014
My sister, she's a good shot.

No, that girl she had
different hair, I saw it.

Who was she?

48:59.342 --> 49:00.572

49:00.607 --> 49:02.475

49:02.510 --> 49:04.477
- So your buddy here says,

49:06.349 --> 49:09.515
"You didn't tell no one about
what you saw the other night."

49:09.550 --> 49:12.518
- No, no, I swear, we
haven't gone to the police.

49:12.553 --> 49:14.058
We haven't gone to anyone.

49:14.093 --> 49:15.554
We won't tell anyone.

49:17.822 --> 49:20.559

city with her family

49:57.334 --> 49:59.202

49:59.237 --> 50:03.569
- The Vanderbilt
place.

50:03.604 --> 50:05.703
Oh, no shit, huh?

50:05.738 --> 50:08.772

51:45.772 --> 51:47.541
That was so much fun.

51:56.783 --> 51:58.519
But we got a problem.

51:59.819 --> 52:02.457

little late for that.

52:21.676 --> 52:24.578
- I guess so.

52:24.613 --> 52:26.217
Tuck away the girl.

52:27.616 --> 52:28.252
- Okay.

apologize about.

54:02.876 --> 54:05.382
I just wanna be there for you.

54:06.484 --> 54:07.384
- Be there?

54:09.619 --> 54:13.951
- Uh, yeah, uh, like a parent,
a sister, a hybrid I guess.

54:17.088 --> 54:20.562
- Look, you're not
my mom or my sister.

54:20.597 --> 54:23.763
You're just the woman
who's fucking my dad.

54:24.931 --> 54:26.535
- Well, I don't think

54:26.570 --> 54:28.339
that's a very appropriate
way to speak to me.

54:28.374 --> 54:30.000
- I don't give a shit.

54:31.707 --> 54:33.674
- Now you wait here.

54:33.709 --> 54:36.776
I may not be your mother,
but you're not 18 either.

54:36.811 --> 54:38.008
- Don't touch me.

54:38.043 --> 54:39.548
You wanna help me?

54:39.583 --> 54:40.648
Huh, you wanna be there for me?

55:35.606 --> 55:37.903
Shit.

55:40.578 --> 55:41.445
Where's home?

55:57.628 --> 56:00.629
- Momma always told us
not to play with our food.

56:00.664 --> 56:02.697
- That she did.

56:02.732 --> 56:04.600
But I want this one to hurt.

56:04.635 --> 56:08.098
- Then hurt her.

56:19.045 --> 56:22.816
- Here, kitty.

56:22.851 --> 56:24.147
I got you a treat.

56:25.051 --> 56:27.920
Come on.

56:27.955 --> 56:30.054
- What are you doing?

56:30.089 --> 56:32.991
- Um, I, uh, trying
to find that cat.

56:35.028 --> 56:37.094
I even got it a treat.

56:37.129 --> 56:41.604
I'd leave it out but I don't
wanna attract any bears so.

56:42.739 --> 56:43.573
- Yeah.

56:46.204 --> 56:48.941
- Sarah, she told
me what you said.

56:50.549 --> 56:52.780
- I should
apologize, I know.

56:52.815 --> 56:55.618
- Well, that would be a start.

56:55.653 --> 56:59.490
- I'm just, I'm kinda
dealing with a lot right now.

57:00.757 --> 57:02.152
- Well, that's just it.

57:02.187 --> 57:03.560
Uh, I mean I don't think

57:03.595 --> 57:05.760
you understand that,
that so is she, so am I.

57:05.795 --> 57:08.026
We're all, we're all dealing
with a lot right now.

57:08.061 --> 57:09.566
- That's
not my fault though.

57:09.601 --> 57:12.965
- Well, some of it is,
and, and that's a fact.

57:14.705 --> 57:17.134
- Why don't you ever
try to talk to me?

57:18.643 --> 57:19.609
Why don't you?

57:21.679 --> 57:23.272
You've always seen me
as a problem child,

57:23.307 --> 57:27.947
something to fix like
I'm one of your patients.

57:27.982 --> 57:30.180
You drag me all the way over
here away from my friends.

57:30.215 --> 57:32.116
You bought a mini van.

57:32.151 --> 57:35.086
What are you gonna do with
a mini van in the city?

57:35.121 --> 57:38.254
- Um, uh, try to provide
you with a normal life.

57:38.289 --> 57:41.191
Like at least as
normal as I can.

57:41.226 --> 57:43.567
- You took me away from Mom.

57:45.296 --> 57:47.802
- Cassie, no, that's not fair.

57:51.203 --> 57:53.038
- Do you know how
much I visit her?

57:53.073 --> 57:53.907
Do you?

57:55.779 --> 58:00.584
I visit her every Friday after
school with some friends.

58:01.752 --> 58:03.246
You know Tina, the
girl that you called

58:03.281 --> 58:05.017
a bad influence in
front of the judge?

58:05.052 --> 58:09.890
Yeah, she brings flowers to
Mom's grave, Mom's grave.

58:09.925 --> 58:10.726
- I'm sorry.

58:12.125 --> 58:14.730
How, how would I know?

58:14.765 --> 58:17.667
- That's the problem,
you wouldn't.

58:27.239 --> 58:29.580
May I please borrow the van?

58:31.782 --> 58:32.682
- For what?

58:35.148 --> 58:37.588
- I wanna see my new friends.

58:44.025 --> 58:46.355
- Sure.

58:46.390 --> 58:48.962
Just please, please be careful.

58:53.771 --> 58:54.605
Please.

59:22.426 --> 59:23.898
- Hey, baby.

59:23.933 --> 59:24.767
- Hey.

59:28.971 --> 59:32.104
- So, uh, that errand that
you ran the other day.

59:32.139 --> 59:33.303
- Yeah.

59:33.338 --> 59:35.679
- What were you doing?

59:35.714 --> 59:39.078
- Uh, you know I, I ran
to the corner store,

59:39.113 --> 59:41.883
I, I was gonna see
if they still had,

59:41.918 --> 59:43.819
uh, video tapes and
stuff for rental,

59:43.854 --> 59:46.723
but I guess they stopped
doing it years ago.

59:52.830 --> 59:56.865
- So, um, I'm guessing
that it has nothing to do

59:56.900 --> 1:00:00.737
with the gun that I found
in our bedroom then.

1:00:04.237 --> 1:00:05.775
- Look, I just wanted

1:00:05.810 --> 1:00:08.437
to keep us safe.
- You know the statistics,

1:00:08.472 --> 1:00:11.308
and you bring a
gun into our home.

1:00:14.313 --> 1:00:16.819
- I know it probably
seems way out of character

1:00:16.854 --> 1:00:19.789
but with all troubles, Cassie,

1:00:19.824 --> 1:00:21.285
and then the bullet
hole in the van,

1:00:21.320 --> 1:00:22.990
and then-
- But you see this.

1:00:23.025 --> 1:00:26.763
This right here, Lucas, is
what's making her crazy.

1:00:26.798 --> 1:00:29.766
You're over analyzing
and controlling.

1:00:30.868 --> 1:00:32.461
A hunting accident happens

1:00:32.496 --> 1:00:36.102
and you bring a
gun into our home.

1:00:36.137 --> 1:00:39.303
- Do we really know it was a
hunting accident, like really?

1:00:39.338 --> 1:00:43.241
- No, but I'm pretty positive.

1:00:45.146 --> 1:00:48.213
Look,

1:00:48.248 --> 1:00:50.083
just lay off, okay?

1:00:52.417 --> 1:00:56.452
Quit trying to control
everything all the time.

1:00:56.487 --> 1:00:58.993
Let people in
situations breathe.

1:01:04.935 --> 1:01:08.035
I want that thing
out of our cabin.

1:04:03.179 --> 1:04:04.013
- Yeah.

1:04:06.017 --> 1:04:07.280
- I was at your place
the other night.

1:04:07.315 --> 1:04:09.183
Your, your dad called me.

1:04:11.022 --> 1:04:11.988
- I saw you.

1:04:16.654 --> 1:04:19.094
- I didn't think you were 21.

1:04:22.297 --> 1:04:26.497
Relax, I'm
not gonna bust you.

1:04:26.532 --> 1:04:28.103
My office received
a couple calls,

1:04:28.138 --> 1:04:30.435
I was wondering if
you could help me.

1:04:30.470 --> 1:04:31.102
- Me?

1:04:32.670 --> 1:04:35.176
- Yeah, just some small stuff.

1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:40.313
- I don't know if I
would be much help.

1:04:40.348 --> 1:04:42.051
- Well, let's see.

1:04:43.153 --> 1:04:44.581
Lou says, "You were in here

1:04:44.616 --> 1:04:48.255
with Tucker Samson and Anna
Wilson the other night."

1:04:48.290 --> 1:04:49.157
Is that true?

1:04:51.656 --> 1:04:54.393
- Yeah, we had a few drinks.

1:04:54.428 --> 1:04:56.230
- Yeah.

1:04:56.265 --> 1:04:57.231
Anything else?

1:04:58.432 --> 1:04:59.398
You go for a ride maybe?

1:04:59.433 --> 1:05:00.399
- Yeah, but that's it.

1:05:00.434 --> 1:05:02.038
We went for a ride.

1:05:04.636 --> 1:05:07.043
- Smoke some dope?

1:05:07.078 --> 1:05:07.703
- We, uh,

1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:12.378
we, uh.

1:05:12.413 --> 1:05:16.679
- I'm
giving you a hard time.

1:05:16.714 --> 1:05:21.090
I'm just asking 'cause Tucker
and Anna are missing now.

1:05:24.095 --> 1:05:27.195
Tucker's grandmother says,
"He was in here last."

1:05:27.230 --> 1:05:28.724
And Anna's employer says,

1:05:28.759 --> 1:05:33.102
"She didn't show up at the
station at shift change."

1:05:33.137 --> 1:05:34.697
- That's terrible.

1:05:34.732 --> 1:05:37.007
- Yeah, I thought so too.

1:05:39.275 --> 1:05:41.044
They're probably
just on some kind

1:05:41.079 --> 1:05:44.245
of lover's retreat or something.

1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:48.084
Did they, did they say
anything, or give a hint,

1:05:50.154 --> 1:05:53.122
or any detail of
what they were doing?

1:05:54.686 --> 1:05:57.126
- No, they didn't mention it.

1:06:04.432 --> 1:06:05.134
- You sure?

1:06:06.335 --> 1:06:07.169
- Yeah.

1:06:11.802 --> 1:06:12.702
- You wouldn't be
hiding something

1:06:12.737 --> 1:06:15.243
from me would you little lady?

1:06:21.515 --> 1:06:23.119
- No, sir.

1:06:26.454 --> 1:06:28.157
- Here, take this.

1:06:31.228 --> 1:06:33.624
If you hear anything, anything.

1:06:40.765 --> 1:06:41.599
- I will.

1:06:42.767 --> 1:06:43.766
- Good girl.

1:06:44.637 --> 1:06:46.571
Lou, keep your nose clean.

1:06:46.606 --> 1:06:48.375
- Sheriff.
- Boys.

1:06:48.410 --> 1:06:51.147
Better have them
tags registered.

1:07:56.742 --> 1:07:59.446
- I, uh, I'm taking
care of things.

1:08:01.615 --> 1:08:06.288
And I think after I do we should
have like a family meeting.

1:08:06.323 --> 1:08:09.192
I think we would all
benefit from that.

1:08:15.728 --> 1:08:17.794
- What was that?

1:08:17.829 --> 1:08:19.301
- I'm not sure.

1:08:31.282 --> 1:08:31.907
Oh, my!

1:08:33.548 --> 1:08:35.350
Baby, stay inside, stay inside.

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:37.220
Oh, my God.

1:09:34.972 --> 1:09:35.971
- I'm
sorry but the call

1:09:36.006 --> 1:09:37.610
cannot be connected as dialed.

1:09:37.645 --> 1:09:38.281
- Shit.

1:09:52.726 --> 1:09:53.560
Dad.

1:10:02.769 --> 1:10:04.901
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,
Sarah, Sarah, look at me.

1:10:04.936 --> 1:10:05.968
Sarah.

1:10:06.003 --> 1:10:07.442
- Cassie.

1:10:07.477 --> 1:10:09.741
Cassie, Cassie, you
need to get out.

1:10:09.776 --> 1:10:11.347
- It's okay.
- Cassie, you need to run.

1:10:11.382 --> 1:10:12.546
- It's okay.

1:10:12.581 --> 1:10:14.647
- No, no, Cassie,
you don't understand.

1:10:14.682 --> 1:10:15.681
They're here.

1:10:15.716 --> 1:10:16.582
Cassie, they're here

1:10:16.617 --> 1:10:17.782
and they're gonna kill us.
- I got you.

1:10:17.817 --> 1:10:18.948
- Please go now.

1:10:18.983 --> 1:10:20.389
- No, hang on, almost got it.

1:10:20.424 --> 1:10:22.655
- Cass, Cassie,
he's right behind you!

1:10:35.901 --> 1:10:39.738
- No, don't.

1:10:49.684 --> 1:10:50.584
Don't move.

1:11:04.501 --> 1:11:06.402
You remind me of my pa.

1:11:08.769 --> 1:11:10.307
Didn't much like him.

1:11:12.839 --> 1:11:15.642
My brother and I, we
stuck closer to our momma.

1:11:15.677 --> 1:11:19.514
It's, it's a good thing
too, 'cause made it easier

1:11:19.549 --> 1:11:23.419
when she decided to gut
him with the Bowie knife.

1:11:24.653 --> 1:11:27.654
Anyway, she used
to read us stories.

1:11:27.689 --> 1:11:28.523
Oh.

1:11:30.923 --> 1:11:32.054
Oh, that's so pretty.

1:11:32.089 --> 1:11:32.923
Look it.

1:11:34.058 --> 1:11:35.959
- Why are you doing this?

1:11:37.633 --> 1:11:41.602
- You ever read your
daughter stories?

1:11:41.637 --> 1:11:42.471
Huh?

1:11:45.641 --> 1:11:46.343
- No.
- No?

1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:49.445
No, of course not.

1:11:50.712 --> 1:11:52.481
Your kind never does.

1:11:56.685 --> 1:12:00.390
Well, do you know the
story about William Tell?

1:12:01.822 --> 1:12:02.821
Do ya?

1:12:02.856 --> 1:12:03.459
- No.
- No.

1:12:05.463 --> 1:12:07.397
Public schools these days.

1:12:11.029 --> 1:12:13.502
What the fuck do I know, right?

1:12:22.579 --> 1:12:24.414
You should stay still.

1:12:26.682 --> 1:12:27.384
Real still.

1:12:29.652 --> 1:12:31.883
'Cause I'm a pretty good shot

1:12:33.018 --> 1:12:35.557
so this probably won't hurt.

1:12:48.605 --> 1:12:50.033
- No, don't

1:12:50.068 --> 1:12:51.639
- Oh, that's way too close.

1:12:51.674 --> 1:12:52.739
Hey.

1:12:57.812 --> 1:12:58.712
It's for sissies.

1:12:58.747 --> 1:12:59.581
Come on.

1:13:01.915 --> 1:13:02.749
There.

1:13:04.885 --> 1:13:06.016
That's better.

1:13:07.591 --> 1:13:08.425
Wish me luck.

1:13:11.727 --> 1:13:12.495
One,

1:13:14.664 --> 1:13:15.498
two,

1:13:18.569 --> 1:13:19.469
and a half.

1:13:48.896 --> 1:13:51.160
- You got any real
food around here?

1:13:54.605 --> 1:13:55.802
Besides yourself.

1:13:57.773 --> 1:13:58.673
I'm starving.

1:14:01.711 --> 1:14:02.611
- Fuck you.

1:14:04.010 --> 1:14:04.811
- What's that?

1:14:04.846 --> 1:14:05.779
- Fuck you!

1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:14.524
- The language in your
generation it's not becoming.

1:14:16.055 --> 1:14:20.563
Somebody needs to teach you
young ladies some manners.

1:14:21.830 --> 1:14:25.095
- What, what are
you even doing here?

1:14:25.130 --> 1:14:26.569
- You don't know.

1:14:27.803 --> 1:14:28.670
Ask this one.

1:14:34.843 --> 1:14:35.677
Tell her!

1:14:38.715 --> 1:14:41.716
- Some friends and I
went to their house.

1:14:41.751 --> 1:14:43.982
- Trespassed is more like it.

1:14:45.150 --> 1:14:48.250
Do you know what that means?

1:14:48.285 --> 1:14:51.858
That means I can't let
you survive the night.

1:15:02.134 --> 1:15:05.135
I think your Pa's out
there causing trouble.

1:15:05.170 --> 1:15:06.807
I'm gonna go look.

1:15:11.913 --> 1:15:13.044
- Hey.

1:15:13.079 --> 1:15:13.913
Hey.

1:15:14.784 --> 1:15:15.618
Hey.

1:15:30.195 --> 1:15:32.030
I, I don't understand.

1:15:34.705 --> 1:15:38.707
- They've been keeping girls
locked in their basement.

1:15:38.742 --> 1:15:41.710
Torturing them,
keeping them prisoner.

1:15:43.076 --> 1:15:44.647
And their mother, she.

1:15:44.682 --> 1:15:46.649
- Why didn't you
go to the police?

1:15:46.684 --> 1:15:48.717
- I was afraid.

1:15:48.752 --> 1:15:50.785
I thought maybe they
wouldn't find me

1:15:50.820 --> 1:15:52.182
and all this would go away.

1:15:52.217 --> 1:15:53.381
Kind of like-

1:15:53.416 --> 1:15:55.625
- But this is different.

1:15:57.024 --> 1:16:01.224
If you saw what you say you
saw they would have understood.

1:16:01.259 --> 1:16:02.060
- Maybe.

1:16:07.298 --> 1:16:09.705
Wait, sheriff gave me his card.

1:16:11.071 --> 1:16:13.236
I think it was like 805-5557.

1:16:21.048 --> 1:16:25.149
- Go to the landline, and
hurry before they come back.

1:16:35.227 --> 1:16:36.061
- 80.

1:16:37.768 --> 1:16:38.866
- Hurry.

1:16:38.901 --> 1:16:40.197
- Trying.

1:16:45.270 --> 1:16:46.874
- Hello.

1:16:46.909 --> 1:16:48.777
- Sheriff Vincent, this
is Cassie Vanderbilt.

1:16:48.812 --> 1:16:50.042
We need your help.

1:16:50.077 --> 1:16:51.780
Wait, wait, hold on.

1:16:51.815 --> 1:16:53.078
- My family's being held.

1:16:53.113 --> 1:16:54.783
I don't know where my dad is.

1:16:54.818 --> 1:16:56.950
It's the McKinleys,
fucking McKinleys.

1:16:56.985 --> 1:16:59.282
And they took Tucker and Anna.

1:16:59.317 --> 1:17:00.954
And now they're after me and my-

1:17:00.989 --> 1:17:02.219
- All
right, all right, slow down.

1:17:02.254 --> 1:17:03.187
You're at the cabin?

1:17:03.222 --> 1:17:04.320
- Yes.

1:17:04.355 --> 1:17:05.156
- Okay.

1:17:05.191 --> 1:17:06.289
- Please hurry.

1:17:06.324 --> 1:17:07.895
Need your help.

1:17:09.734 --> 1:17:10.425
I gotta go.

1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:11.159
Hurry.

1:17:11.194 --> 1:17:13.868
- Wait, Cass.

1:17:24.045 --> 1:17:25.077
- Dad.

1:17:27.917 --> 1:17:29.213
- You can't get away.

1:17:29.248 --> 1:17:31.149
No sense trying.

1:17:31.184 --> 1:17:33.921
- I told you I was
good with a gun.

1:17:35.485 --> 1:17:37.188
- Just off him, May.

1:17:37.223 --> 1:17:38.860
We can't keep 'em all.

1:17:40.523 --> 1:17:42.292
- Huh.

1:17:42.327 --> 1:17:46.098
You know what, what if
I wanna use me a man?

1:17:46.133 --> 1:17:48.265
What do you think about that?

1:17:48.300 --> 1:17:50.773
- I'm all the man you need.

1:17:50.808 --> 1:17:52.500
- Says you.

1:17:52.535 --> 1:17:54.238
You always get all
the girls you want.

1:17:54.273 --> 1:17:55.943
What if I wanna use him?

1:17:55.978 --> 1:17:56.812
- Yuck.

1:17:57.881 --> 1:17:59.375
- What?

1:17:59.410 --> 1:18:02.510
- A man and a
man, it ain't natural.

1:18:02.545 --> 1:18:05.150
- Well, then you can just watch

1:18:05.185 --> 1:18:08.186
or you can push the little
record button and go piss off.

1:18:08.221 --> 1:18:09.891
I don't give a shit.

1:18:12.357 --> 1:18:14.027
Beside the fire
needs some tending.

1:18:14.062 --> 1:18:15.259
You should do that.

1:18:15.294 --> 1:18:17.327
- You best mind who
you're talking to.

1:18:17.362 --> 1:18:20.396
Momma said, "I would run
the farm when she was gone."

1:18:20.431 --> 1:18:23.234
- You always say that,
but the funny thing is,

1:18:23.269 --> 1:18:26.072
is I don't remember
ever hearing it!

1:18:41.386 --> 1:18:43.892
So where might the bedroom be?

1:18:51.836 --> 1:18:52.967
- Fucking bitch.

1:19:06.312 --> 1:19:09.984
Everything I done for
her and this family.

1:19:17.191 --> 1:19:19.257
- Jesus.

1:19:37.013 --> 1:19:38.408
What are you doing?

1:20:25.523 --> 1:20:27.028
- Don't be afraid.

1:20:31.298 --> 1:20:32.132
- Oh, God.

1:20:35.368 --> 1:20:37.203
Please don't.

1:20:37.238 --> 1:20:41.306
- My brother Clete says,
"I got me a pretty smile."

1:20:42.705 --> 1:20:45.277
You think I got a
pretty smile, huh?

1:20:46.478 --> 1:20:49.017
- You don't have to do this.

1:20:55.388 --> 1:20:58.389
- You try anything
and I'll fucking cut

1:21:00.030 --> 1:21:02.030
your daughter's head off
with a pair of scissors,

1:21:02.065 --> 1:21:05.594
and she will feel
every second of it.

1:21:05.629 --> 1:21:08.399
- Please
don't, don't, don't.

1:21:08.434 --> 1:21:09.235
- Shh.

1:21:12.405 --> 1:21:15.208
Shall we see what
we're working with?

1:21:16.574 --> 1:21:17.408
- Oh, God.

1:21:54.315 --> 1:21:55.314
- Shit.

1:22:10.232 --> 1:22:11.330
- Dammit, Clete!

1:22:13.763 --> 1:22:14.395
- Sheriff.

1:22:18.372 --> 1:22:21.043
- Remember what we talked about?

1:22:22.475 --> 1:22:24.310
No city folk.

1:22:24.345 --> 1:22:25.476
Absolutely none.

1:22:26.512 --> 1:22:27.346
- I know.

1:22:28.382 --> 1:22:29.711
- Then why'd you do it?

1:22:29.746 --> 1:22:31.515
You're not listening.

1:22:33.156 --> 1:22:34.518
Should of seen me
spinning my wheels

1:22:34.553 --> 1:22:37.455
when they called me out here.

1:22:37.490 --> 1:22:39.754
Y'all shot at them
when they driving.

1:22:39.789 --> 1:22:41.591
- They came to my farm, Sheriff.

1:22:41.626 --> 1:22:43.263
- I don't give a shit!

1:22:46.598 --> 1:22:48.268
Is May in there?

1:22:48.303 --> 1:22:49.368
- Yeah.

1:22:52.373 --> 1:22:55.011
- And the Vanderbilts,
they alive?

1:23:07.718 --> 1:23:08.519
Okay.

1:23:10.127 --> 1:23:11.225
Okay, good.

1:23:11.260 --> 1:23:13.359
You know what this means?

1:23:13.394 --> 1:23:16.626
- Nah, Vinny, I don't.

1:23:16.661 --> 1:23:21.499
- Remember
what we talked about
all those years ago.

1:23:21.534 --> 1:23:24.139
Runaways and strays, that's it.

1:23:25.538 --> 1:23:29.243
We're not slaughtering
families in their houses.

1:23:29.278 --> 1:23:30.244
- It's we now.

1:23:31.478 --> 1:23:34.149
You never let me have a say.

1:23:34.184 --> 1:23:37.515
You wouldn't even
make me a deputy.

1:23:37.550 --> 1:23:40.683
- Yeah.

1:23:40.718 --> 1:23:43.257
I would never
survive re-election.

1:23:43.292 --> 1:23:45.523
I, I did it for both of us.

1:23:45.558 --> 1:23:46.623
For the family.

1:23:48.132 --> 1:23:50.165
If you and May
would have laid low.

1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:52.464
- That was never the plan.

1:23:52.499 --> 1:23:55.170
Grandpop said, "I
was the next one."

1:23:55.205 --> 1:23:57.205
I was the oldest cousin.

1:23:57.240 --> 1:23:58.701
The smartest cousin.

1:24:01.409 --> 1:24:04.179
- So smart you
got caught, Clete.

1:24:09.219 --> 1:24:12.847
You did the one thing and
you got fucking caught.

1:24:16.655 --> 1:24:19.557
I feel sorry for you,

1:24:19.592 --> 1:24:23.594
all those years in there must
have something to your brain.

1:24:23.629 --> 1:24:25.134
Just come with me.

1:24:25.928 --> 1:24:28.302
- You're shitting yourself.

1:24:28.337 --> 1:24:32.240
- If this goes any further
it'll be bad for both of us.

1:24:32.275 --> 1:24:35.276
And you knew that when
you drove up here.

1:24:36.609 --> 1:24:40.215
- If you take me in,
I'll show 'em the tapes.

1:24:41.581 --> 1:24:44.879
I got a whole stash
of 'em with you in 'em

1:24:45.750 --> 1:24:47.420
and the young girls.

1:24:56.563 --> 1:24:57.397
- What?

1:25:03.306 --> 1:25:05.702
You need to take better
inventory of your stuff

1:25:05.737 --> 1:25:08.144
'cause I nabbed it years ago.

1:25:09.708 --> 1:25:14.447
Let's do us both a favor and
just get in the car with me.

1:25:15.516 --> 1:25:16.878
I'll grab your crazy sister.

1:25:18.684 --> 1:25:20.519
- Nah.

1:25:20.554 --> 1:25:22.257
We ain't going nowhere.

1:25:26.692 --> 1:25:27.625
- You know,

1:25:29.761 --> 1:25:32.366
I'm getting real tired.

1:25:41.839 --> 1:25:44.642
- Can't trust nobody no more.

1:25:44.677 --> 1:25:46.215
Not even family.

1:25:47.977 --> 1:25:49.746
- When we were younger,

1:25:49.781 --> 1:25:53.387
you used to follow
me around everywhere,

1:25:53.422 --> 1:25:55.884
and sometimes you lagged behind.

1:25:56.887 --> 1:25:58.854
You know what I used to say

1:25:58.889 --> 1:26:00.328
to get you to move faster?

1:26:02.926 --> 1:26:04.794
I used to say chop, chop.

1:26:12.573 --> 1:26:14.804
- He's going to the fire.

1:26:42.339 --> 1:26:42.931
- I can't get it.

1:26:46.002 --> 1:26:48.904
You're not gonna hurt my family!

1:26:48.939 --> 1:26:50.444
- Untie you.

1:26:56.078 --> 1:26:57.880
- Go get
the gun, better run!

1:26:57.915 --> 1:27:00.586
Hurry!

1:27:13.568 --> 1:27:17.372
- You don't know how to
use that thing do you, huh?

1:27:17.407 --> 1:27:20.408
You probably don't
either, city boy.

1:27:26.746 --> 1:27:27.811
- We gotta go.
- Run.

1:27:27.846 --> 1:27:29.516
- Come on.
- Go.

1:27:29.551 --> 1:27:30.979
- You're not going anywhere.

1:27:31.014 --> 1:27:32.816
- Come on, come on.

1:27:32.851 --> 1:27:34.422
Oh, my God, go, go.

1:27:42.795 --> 1:27:45.532
- You're next, bitch!

1:27:45.567 --> 1:27:47.633
We're gonna find you.

1:27:47.668 --> 1:27:49.635
You can't hide, I promise.

1:28:12.429 --> 1:28:13.659
- No.

1:28:27.510 --> 1:28:29.576
- Son of bitch,
this fuckin' hurts.

1:28:31.613 --> 1:28:32.909
- Huh?

1:28:32.944 --> 1:28:34.911
You never been shot before?

1:28:34.946 --> 1:28:37.419
Not even on accident?

1:28:37.454 --> 1:28:40.884
- No, Clete, 'cause I
ain't no fuckin' retard.

1:28:46.529 --> 1:28:48.694
Those aren't gonna
burn down all the way.

1:28:48.729 --> 1:28:49.563
- I know.

1:28:51.061 --> 1:28:52.599
- So you're
wasting your time.

1:28:52.634 --> 1:28:54.766
- No, I'm not, I cooking it.

1:28:58.871 --> 1:29:00.937
Ain't you got a girl to find?

1:29:00.972 --> 1:29:02.939
- She'll come.

1:29:02.974 --> 1:29:04.875
They always do.

1:29:04.910 --> 1:29:07.548
That is if she
loves you she will.

1:29:09.211 --> 1:29:12.014
Where are you little lady?

1:29:12.049 --> 1:29:14.456
- Oh, that's a brilliant plan.

1:29:14.491 --> 1:29:16.854
She's probably half
way to town by now.

1:29:16.889 --> 1:29:18.394
- Fuck off, Clete.

1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:22.827
You are really gettin'
on my nerves today.

1:29:26.129 --> 1:29:29.702
I'll let you live, I promise.

1:29:32.036 --> 1:29:35.477
If you come even quicker
I'll even let your dad live.

1:29:35.512 --> 1:29:37.842
Now that's one
hell of a bargain.

1:29:39.549 --> 1:29:40.174
Huh?

1:29:42.882 --> 1:29:43.848
Fuck

1:29:46.248 --> 1:29:47.082
Oh, shit.

1:29:48.690 --> 1:29:50.151
You watch him.
- I'm watching him.

1:29:50.186 --> 1:29:53.220
- All right, if he tries to
get away you know what to do.

1:29:53.255 --> 1:29:56.564
- She's really
getting under my skin.

1:30:16.718 --> 1:30:19.048
Want a little Sheriff?

1:30:36.639 --> 1:30:37.638
You're next.

1:31:06.262 --> 1:31:09.802
Don't worry, she's
probably using her tags.

1:31:17.141 --> 1:31:19.108
You dumb motherfucker.

1:31:22.146 --> 1:31:23.684
Go get 'em, May.

1:31:25.589 --> 1:31:26.214
- Gotcha.

1:31:31.859 --> 1:31:32.924
What?

1:31:49.272 --> 1:31:51.547
- May, you all right, girl?

1:32:06.025 --> 1:32:07.794
- Looking for this?

1:32:11.998 --> 1:32:16.000
You should know better
than to fuck with family.

1:32:43.667 --> 1:32:45.832
- No, Cassie, don't.

1:32:49.035 --> 1:32:52.839
- Looks like I did
know how to use this.

1:32:55.206 --> 1:32:56.909
Don't worry, Dad.

1:33:18.867 --> 1:33:20.163
Bye, motherfucker.

1:33:27.205 --> 1:33:28.138
