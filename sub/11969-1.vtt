03:24.640 --> 03:27.007
So what do you think
the dream means?

03:28.160 --> 03:30.720
That your vagina is
completely disease-infested.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.439
Shut up. For real.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.078
Okay, babies...

03:35.880 --> 03:38.519
"Babies are symbolic
of change and renewal.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.953
<i>"If the baby is a stranger to you,</i>

03:40.040 --> 03:42.429
<i>"it may represent something</i>
<i>developing within yourself</i>

03:42.520 --> 03:44.875
<i>"that is not yet ready to be born."</i>

03:45.120 --> 03:47.680
And it doesn't say anything
about babies in formaldehyde.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.007
Okay,
what about dogs?

03:50.100 --> 03:51.513
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

03:51.960 --> 03:55.191
"In mythology, the dog was often seen
as a messenger of the dead."

03:55.280 --> 03:59.990
Then it just goes on and on about
some more psychobabble bullshit.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.280
So, where are the kids?

04:03.800 --> 04:06.598
<i>Did you have to, like, change diapers</i>
<i>and shit like that?</i>

04:06.680 --> 04:08.989
Nope, the baby
was down when I got here,

04:09.080 --> 04:12.390
and the four-year-old,
he conked out as soon as I read to him.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.356
Do you think they have porn
in their DVD collection?

04:15.440 --> 04:18.398
Like I really want to know
what Mr Newton beats off to.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.639
Well, it's not Mrs Newton,
that's for sure.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.550
<i>- Case?</i>
- Hang on.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.396
<i>Look in the mirror.</i>

04:34.000 --> 04:36.594
<i>Some people are doorways.</i>

04:42.560 --> 04:45.074
Matty? Matty, are you up?

04:46.480 --> 04:49.597
Hey, Rom, I think one of the kids is awake.
I'm going to call you back, okay?

04:49.680 --> 04:51.557
<i>Good luck.</i>
- All right.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.669
Keep looking.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.195
Matty?

05:29.280 --> 05:30.269
Keep looking.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.238
Keep looking.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.948
What are you doing, Matty?

05:51.040 --> 05:53.156
Keep looking.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.276
Keep looking.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.998
Matty!

05:59.320 --> 06:01.231
Matty, stop that.
We have to go to bed now.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.193
Matty!

06:04.680 --> 06:06.750
Jumby wants to be born now.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.594
Are you sure you're all right?

06:10.680 --> 06:12.830
Yeah, no, it's fine, it's not a big deal.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.433
I'd feel better if you'd had
your eye checked out.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.397
Okay, I will.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.230
I'll see you guys later, okay?

07:03.080 --> 07:04.479
Hey, Dad.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.949
- Hi, Case. How was sitting?
- Good.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.792
There's cheesecake from La Scarola,
if you want.

07:08.880 --> 07:12.873
Mmm, no, thanks. I'm just...
I'm gonna crash. Good night.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.199
Oh, my God!

09:15.560 --> 09:19.394
He was shining a mirror in the baby's face.
And then he hit me.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.072
Okay, that's creepy.

09:21.160 --> 09:25.551
The kid's like four. I mean, he probably
didn't even know what he was doing.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.631
It's bad luck, you know.

09:28.320 --> 09:32.359
Newborns aren't supposed to see their own
reflection till they're at least a year old.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.795
It means they'll die soon.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.074
According to whom?

09:36.160 --> 09:38.390
It's just one of those superstitions,
you know.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.993
You're retarded. She's retarded.

09:41.160 --> 09:44.709
It's not like I'm saying I believe it,
I'm just saying it's one of those things.

09:44.800 --> 09:49.669
Okay, so as far as we know,
the universe is roughly 15 billion years old.

09:49.760 --> 09:50.954
Right?

09:51.040 --> 09:55.272
So, if the universe had a beginning,
what happened before the beginning?

09:55.360 --> 09:58.750
Einstein would tell us
that there was no before,

09:58.840 --> 10:01.400
because time itself did not yet exist.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.392
So here's another question for you.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.391
How big is the universe?

10:09.400 --> 10:12.631
Does the universe
just keep going on forever?

10:12.720 --> 10:17.555
And if it doesn't just keep going on forever,
then what's beyond the edge?

10:23.080 --> 10:26.629
Maybe yes, maybe no. Here's the catch.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.676
Since our universe began...

10:28.760 --> 10:31.035
<i>Jumby wants to be born now.</i>

10:31.120 --> 10:33.190
...back where you started.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.352
It'd be like walking into a mirror.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.195
Is everything all right, Casey?

10:42.280 --> 10:45.033
Yeah, I... I just need to get some air.

11:09.120 --> 11:14.911
So he texts me, like, the day after
we went out. And he put, "I miss you."

11:15.000 --> 11:18.310
But then when I text him back,
he never replied.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.868
And that was like two days ago.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.869
Case.

11:25.920 --> 11:29.754
- There's something wrong with your eye.
- What are you talking about?

11:29.840 --> 11:32.798
I don't know, dude,
I think you should look.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.710
It's called heterochromia.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.439
Meaning one iris
is a different colour than the other.

11:43.520 --> 11:47.672
Usually, it's congenital.
Sometimes it occurs after a blunt trauma.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.557
On very rare occasions,
it might be indicative

11:49.640 --> 11:52.757
of a malignant melanoma of the iris.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.957
In order to rule that out, I'll just need
to take a few digital pictures.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.359
Okay.

11:57.440 --> 12:01.718
I'll go ahead an insert a speculum
in order to keep your eyelids open.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.199
Oh, God.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.676
Just relax and everything will be fine.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.035
Ooh!

12:13.920 --> 12:16.195
All right, you're doing great.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.475
Okay, go ahead
and rest your chin right here.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.154
And keep your head very still
while we take a few pictures, all right?

12:22.240 --> 12:23.878
- Okay.
- All right.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.391
Good. Good.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.234
- So, does it hurt?
- Mmm-mmm.

12:35.320 --> 12:40.474
I think the light's just a little bright
because of the eye-drops that he gave me.

12:40.560 --> 12:45.156
Baby, thank you for coming with me.
I know I'm such a pain in the ass right now.

12:45.240 --> 12:48.152
Mmm-hmm! Yeah, you are, yeah.

12:48.240 --> 12:53.439
The good news is that my dad's not gonna
be home till tomorrow morning.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.752
- Does that mean what I think it means?
- Yes.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.598
Great, 'cause, you know,
'cause those glasses, they're just...

13:02.680 --> 13:04.079
They're definitely giving me wood.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.753
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.390
Hey. You all right?

13:21.480 --> 13:23.232
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

13:37.480 --> 13:41.189
<i>You know,</i>
<i>it really screws with your head,</i>

13:41.280 --> 13:43.316
<i>what Mr Shields was saying.</i>

13:43.400 --> 13:47.757
That the universe doesn't have an end.
I used to have nightmares about it.

13:48.600 --> 13:54.596
That the world would just stop spinning,
and we'd just fall off out into space.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.796
I'd get so upset by it,

13:57.840 --> 14:02.356
that one day we'd just keep falling
forever and ever and ever. No?

14:02.680 --> 14:07.071
Yeah. No, I mean, I still get that way
when I think about dying.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.914
You know, me and just all
my thoughts ending.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.117
So you don't think there's an afterlife.
No, why?

14:16.200 --> 14:20.591
Because I don't feel her anywhere.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.268
I mean, I remember the
last time I saw her.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.156
<i>We went to the hospital.</i>

14:30.520 --> 14:35.036
<i>And she was just sitting there</i>
<i>staring out the window.</i>

14:39.400 --> 14:42.710
<i>It was almost as if
she was already gone.</i>

14:43.880 --> 14:46.110
Did she say anything to you?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.919
Well, she was adopted,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.753
and I guess she found out
who her birth mother was.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.352
<i>Then she died that night.</i>

15:05.320 --> 15:09.950
You know, they say that it takes a really
long time when you hang yourself,

15:10.040 --> 15:12.600
that some people have second thoughts.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.513
<i>And then they can't
do anything about it.</i>

15:21.120 --> 15:23.839
God, I used to hate her for leaving us.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.355
Hey.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.549
Come here.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.679
What? What? What?

16:48.760 --> 16:52.070
Inside! Inside the mirror! Inside...

17:04.599 --> 17:08.559
I didn't see anything in the mirror.
What did you see, huh?

17:59.600 --> 18:01.397
Mrs Byrne, what's going on?

18:01.480 --> 18:04.074
It's the baby. She wasn't breathing.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.910
No, please, don't take her!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.319
She can't be dead!

18:21.000 --> 18:22.115
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.795
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm sorry!

18:36.920 --> 18:41.038
Well, we've gotten your lab results back.
And everything looks fine.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.232
But there was one oddity.
Are you a twin by any chance, Miss Beldon?

18:46.920 --> 18:49.115
No, I'm an only child.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.196
Are you familiar with the term
"genetic mosaicism"?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.950
Occasionally,
when you're dealing with twins,

18:56.040 --> 18:58.235
the placentas can become fused

18:58.320 --> 19:01.118
and a certain amount of blood
will be exchanged back and forth.

19:01.200 --> 19:05.512
I suppose the emerging pigmentation
in your affected iris could be the result

19:05.600 --> 19:07.113
of that foreign genetic strand.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.714
Now I don't think it's anything
you need to worry about.

19:09.800 --> 19:13.998
But you may wanna see a genetic counsellor,
just to be on the safe side.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.033
Excuse me.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.990
Case, what's up?

19:36.080 --> 19:39.595
I just got back from the eye doctor,
and I got my test results back.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.238
And?

19:41.320 --> 19:43.356
Am I a twin, Dad?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.558
Yes.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.198
- Oh, my God.
- You had...

19:51.280 --> 19:53.350
You would have had a brother.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.955
Sweetheart, he died
while you were still in utero.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.393
How?

19:58.480 --> 20:01.950
- Case, it's a long time ago...
- Dad, I need to know.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.948
It was a freak thing.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.634
One of the umbilical cords
got twisted around his throat.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.039
My cord?

20:18.280 --> 20:21.431
So, my brother died?

20:23.200 --> 20:25.794
Is that why Mom killed herself?

20:25.880 --> 20:29.873
Your mother was clinically depressed.
Period.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.838
The hard truth is that
some people come into this world

20:33.920 --> 20:35.114
less equipped for life than others.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.792
Like my brother?

20:36.880 --> 20:39.553
He was never your brother, Case.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.438
It was way too early
in the pregnancy for that.

20:42.520 --> 20:46.752
- Did he have a name?
- Neither of you did yet.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.559
We had nicknames for you, though.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.676
What was his nickname?

20:51.760 --> 20:52.988
Jumby.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.672
I can't believe I let you
talk me into coming down here.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.513
Look, my mom obviously thought
this woman was important.

22:13.600 --> 22:18.116
I mean, why would she have kept
that article? And this creepy photo?

22:18.200 --> 22:20.156
- The kid from your dreams.
- Yes.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.514
Okay.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.558
You know, Case, if this was me,
I would just take one of my mom's Xanax,

22:24.640 --> 22:25.868
and I would just call it a day.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.109
Okay, so just wait in the car.

22:27.200 --> 22:31.079
No, no. This is way too bizarro
for me to miss out on.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.759
Excuse me.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.040
We're here to see Sofi Kozma.
We called earlier.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.588
Yeah, if you could please sign in.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.077
She is on the third floor, room 307.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.513
Let's go.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.473
God, it smells like diarrhoea in there.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.918
Look at the munchkin lady.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.275
That guy's wearing a diaper.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.351
God, I never want to get old.

23:17.440 --> 23:21.672
No one does. Mr Walker suffered a stroke.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.194
Now he's paralysed from the waist down.

23:24.280 --> 23:29.877
But he doesn't suffer much any more.
His mind is elsewhere.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.157
It's very homey here.

23:36.840 --> 23:40.310
It's tolerable.
I've certainly endured worse.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.150
What was over there?

23:44.360 --> 23:45.395
Oh!

23:46.240 --> 23:49.437
There used to be a mirror there.
I had it removed.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.636
Are you a twin, Casey?

23:56.560 --> 24:00.758
I was.
I had a brother who died in the womb.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.751
How did you know that?

24:02.840 --> 24:05.593
I used to have a twin brother as well.

24:05.680 --> 24:09.912
I can sense it sometimes in others.
Certain kind of manner.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.199
I just recently found out about my brother.
And that's sort of what led me here today.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.396
My mother's name was Janet Beldon.

24:18.480 --> 24:24.555
She passed away a few years ago,
but I found this in her things.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.312
Did you know my mother?

24:37.400 --> 24:40.312
No, I'm... I'm afraid not.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.868
She never tried to contact you?

24:46.080 --> 24:48.389
Well, this is her.

24:49.760 --> 24:53.673
- Are you sure you've never seen her?
- I'm sorry, dear.

24:53.760 --> 24:57.389
What about the boy in the
reflection here. Did you know him?

25:00.080 --> 25:01.513
Get out!

25:02.720 --> 25:04.790
- Get out!
- I'm sorry, what did I say...

25:04.880 --> 25:05.756
Get out!

25:06.080 --> 25:07.638
What the hell was that?

25:07.720 --> 25:09.950
One second she's fine,
and then she does a bitch flip.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.837
How did she know I was a twin?

25:11.920 --> 25:14.480
She's crazy.
She probably has Old Timer's!

25:14.560 --> 25:17.028
No. No, she knew something.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.076
Come on, get real.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.469
- What if she does?
- She doesn't!

25:21.560 --> 25:24.472
Okay, so, you had some weird dreams.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.913
And then this thing
happens with your eye,

25:26.000 --> 25:27.831
and then you found out
you would have had a brother.

25:27.920 --> 25:31.993
Believe me, that alone is enough
to send me into therapy.

25:32.080 --> 25:36.835
But that's all we're talking about here.
Just some weird coincidences. Yes.

25:36.920 --> 25:39.275
- No, what about the Newtons' baby dying?
- What about the Newtons' baby?

25:39.360 --> 25:41.112
And what Matty said?

25:41.200 --> 25:46.479
He said "Jumby," Romy. The nickname
that my parents used for my brother.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.949
You're the superstitious one here.

25:49.480 --> 25:53.837
You tell me there's not something really
going on. Because you know there is.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.751
I'm not crazy, Romy.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.118
But ever since
Matty freaked out that night, I...

26:06.160 --> 26:07.957
I've been seeing things.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.679
What kinds of things?

26:12.520 --> 26:15.193
Do you believe in ghosts?

26:15.280 --> 26:16.952
You know I do.

26:17.040 --> 26:20.999
Do you think it's possible to be haunted
by someone who was never even born?

26:25.880 --> 26:27.279
You owe me.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.994
These things are not easy
to find these days.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.149
Are you sure you want to see
what's on this?

26:32.240 --> 26:33.229
I do.

27:41.640 --> 27:43.915
Did it mean anything to you?

27:45.880 --> 27:48.633
It was the hospital where my mom died.

27:50.520 --> 27:55.230
Beyond that door,
that's where she hung herself.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.714
I feel like she left all
that stuff for a reason.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.713
You know, like she was, I don't know,
trying to tell me something.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.876
Oh, my God, you think
I'm crazy, don't you?

28:08.960 --> 28:10.518
No. No, I don't think you're crazy.

28:11.720 --> 28:15.156
A little hormonal maybe,
but you're not crazy.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.391
- Let's try to have some fun.
- Okay.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.515
- Okay?
- Yes.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.359
Hey, kids! Are we faded yet?

28:27.440 --> 28:31.274
We're trying, but I'm gonna go to
the bar, if you girls want anything.

28:31.360 --> 28:34.272
- I will have a vodka and Red Bull.
- Me, too.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.395
No.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.715
Aw!

28:40.800 --> 28:42.631
Why can't I meet a nice guy like that?

28:42.720 --> 28:45.473
Please, I set you up with Craig Finch
and you totally blew him off.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.516
You wouldn't even talk to him.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.830
Well, that's because
he's too dramatic.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.353
Oh, my God!

30:56.240 --> 30:58.071
Somebody, help me!

31:01.600 --> 31:02.794
No!

31:13.760 --> 31:15.591
Somebody, help me!

31:19.560 --> 31:20.788
Casey.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.517
Casey! Case! Hey, hey, hey!
What happened?

31:26.600 --> 31:28.272
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

31:29.480 --> 31:30.754
Case.

31:32.000 --> 31:32.989
Hey.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.871
<i>Hey, girlie. You okay?</i>

31:40.360 --> 31:42.237
I saw her.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.595
<i>- Who?</i>
- My mother.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.355
<i>You were drinking. You were buzzed.</i>
<i>It was just a hallucination, you know?</i>

31:48.440 --> 31:51.238
This was different. She was there.

31:53.280 --> 31:56.989
What if the same thing that happened
to my mother is happening to me?

31:57.080 --> 31:59.230
What if I end up like she did?

31:59.320 --> 32:03.359
<i>- Have you talked to your dad about it?</i>
- He's out of town.

32:03.440 --> 32:07.353
<i>Casey, you are not going</i>
<i>to end up like her, okay?</i>

32:07.440 --> 32:11.319
How do you know?
You can't have it both ways, Romy.

32:11.400 --> 32:15.313
Either I'm actually crazy,
or something's coming after me,

32:15.400 --> 32:19.552
and if that's the case, then...
Then I have to protect myself.

32:19.640 --> 32:24.509
<i>Okay. Put a pair of scissors underneath</i>
<i>your pillow with the two points open.</i>

32:25.320 --> 32:26.309
Why?

32:26.400 --> 32:29.437
Something my grandmother used to do,
she said it keeps evil spirits away.

32:29.520 --> 32:30.748
<i>You're a freak, Romy.</i>

32:31.480 --> 32:34.040
<i>Yes, but isn't that why you love me?</i>

32:34.120 --> 32:35.792
Yeah, I guess so.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.075
- Good night.
<i>- Good night, hooker.</i>

34:16.360 --> 34:19.750
- Hello?
<i>- I need to speak with you.</i>

34:19.840 --> 34:21.034
Sofi?

34:21.120 --> 34:26.034
<i>I'm sorry for what happened before,</i>
<i>but there are things you need to know.</i>

34:26.120 --> 34:27.757
<i>You must come.</i>

34:29.159 --> 34:32.152
- It's after midnight.
<i>- This can't wait.</i>

34:32.239 --> 34:34.958
<i>I lied about knowing your mother.</i>

34:35.040 --> 34:37.838
<i>She did come to see me,</i>
<i>just before she died.</i>

34:37.920 --> 34:41.435
Oh, my God.
You're the woman she was talking about.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.158
- You're her mother.
<i>- Yes.</i>

34:49.960 --> 34:52.190
Why did you lie to me earlier?

34:52.800 --> 34:56.873
I'm sorry, I was just so startled.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.349
Your mother never told
me you were a twin.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.113
But when I saw your eyes today, I knew.

35:04.320 --> 35:08.199
The boy in that reflection,
that was your great uncle.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.753
My twin brother, Barto.

35:11.840 --> 35:16.038
He died in 1944,
when we were together in Auschwitz.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.876
<i>We were taken to see
the doctor in charge.</i>

35:24.960 --> 35:28.430
<i>A man who was obsessed with twins.</i>

35:36.560 --> 35:40.473
<i>He was very handsome. Very polite.</i>

35:42.080 --> 35:44.469
<i>We thought we'd been rescued.</i>

35:53.600 --> 35:58.071
<i>The Nazis believed that twins could</i>
<i>unravel the mysteries of genetics.</i>

36:05.440 --> 36:08.000
<i>They conducted experiments on us.</i>

36:10.160 --> 36:15.917
<i>Horrible experiments that blurred the line</i>
<i>between science and occult.</i>

36:17.040 --> 36:20.157
<i>One of their obsessions was eye colour.</i>

36:21.160 --> 36:26.234
<i>By trial and error, they attempted</i>
<i>to fabricate blue eyes from brown.</i>

36:28.720 --> 36:30.870
<i>The injections were painful.</i>

36:33.680 --> 36:35.955
<i>Some caused blindness.</i>

36:37.800 --> 36:39.677
<i>Some caused death.</i>

37:00.440 --> 37:03.876
Two days later, he came back, except...

37:06.520 --> 37:08.556
It wasn't really Barto.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.790
A doorway had been opened.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.719
Something else was inhabiting his body.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.711
Something else?

37:22.400 --> 37:24.834
Have you ever heard of a dybbuk?

37:25.520 --> 37:26.714
Mmm-mmm.

37:26.800 --> 37:31.715
It is the soul of a dead person that
has been barred from entering heaven.

37:32.480 --> 37:37.838
So it endlessly wanders the borderlands
between the worlds,

37:37.920 --> 37:40.593
trying to find a new body.

37:40.680 --> 37:43.069
Some people are doorways.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.318
Yes. Especially twins.

37:47.400 --> 37:51.359
Because what is a twin
but another kind of mirror?

37:51.440 --> 37:55.035
And mirrors have always been doorways
to the other world.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.869
What happened to your brother?

38:04.080 --> 38:07.072
From the moment he came back,
I knew it wasn't Barto.

38:08.040 --> 38:12.158
<i>A dybbuk had crossed over</i>
<i>and taken his place.</i>

38:13.600 --> 38:17.309
<i>It had used his body to enter our world.</i>

38:20.920 --> 38:22.353
<i>I killed it.</i>

38:24.680 --> 38:27.831
It's been trying to find
its way back ever since.

38:29.280 --> 38:34.400
Casey. The dybbuk's blood
is on our hands now.

38:36.040 --> 38:40.477
This thing, this entity,
it tried to take hold of your unborn twin!

38:41.640 --> 38:46.316
And when it couldn't have him,
it turned its gaze to the other child.

38:47.560 --> 38:48.709
Me.

38:53.640 --> 38:57.838
It's been circling you
ever since you were born, Casey.

39:04.560 --> 39:05.549
<i>Why now?</i>

39:06.640 --> 39:08.551
Why didn't this start happening before?

39:08.640 --> 39:12.713
It takes time for it
to make its way from the other side.

39:12.800 --> 39:18.670
It enters our world in stages. Always it
inhabits the helpless creatures first,

39:18.760 --> 39:24.392
from insect to animal, slowly making its
way up the ladder of life forms.

39:24.480 --> 39:29.076
- But a twin is what it most desires.
- How do I stop it?

39:29.160 --> 39:31.913
Your mother asked the same question.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.118
I told her about the <i>Sefer ha-marot,</i>
the Book of Mirrors,

39:36.200 --> 39:39.033
which includes the rites of exorcisms.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.679
There is a rabbi
who may be able to help you.

39:42.760 --> 39:46.070
<i>Joseph Sendak. Find him.</i>

40:19.120 --> 40:22.317
Please exercise care
when handling the manuscript.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.389
Thank you.

41:00.480 --> 41:04.473
I guess most of you know me.
Each day is a struggle, you know?

41:07.680 --> 41:13.550
I keep trying to do that searching thing.
Make a moral inventory of myself.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.271
- Be fearless.
- Well, that's all we can ask.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.198
Thank you for sharing, Rick.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.236
All right, it looks like
we're about finished for the day.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.880
We'll pick up where
we left off next week.

41:26.640 --> 41:29.200
If I'm not mistaken,
Henry's up to bat on doughnut duty.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.511
Go easy on us, will you, Henry?
Throw in a few low-fat muffins.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.755
- Excuse me, are you Rabbi Sendak?
- Yes.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.712
Can you read this?

41:53.840 --> 41:59.631
Well, the right hand text is Hebrew,
so I can. It's from the Kabbalah.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.078
Jewish mysticism.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.397
How did you come by this?

42:08.560 --> 42:13.315
Look. I know that this is
gonna sound crazy, believe me.

42:14.840 --> 42:19.391
But I need an exorcism performed.

42:21.280 --> 42:25.478
I'm being haunted by something. I've...

42:25.960 --> 42:27.712
- A dyb... A dyb...
- A dybbuk.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.791
Yes. A dybbuk. Yes.

42:31.440 --> 42:36.514
Well, as for dybbuks, there really
is no such thing, Miss Beldon.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.068
At least, not outside
the realms of folklore.

42:39.880 --> 42:43.429
You have to understand,
back in the Middle Ages,

42:43.520 --> 42:47.354
things like spirits and demons
were really just a catchall

42:47.440 --> 42:51.319
for conditions people weren't capable
of properly diagnosing.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.630
Mental illness, as we know it,
didn't exist back then.

42:53.720 --> 42:57.395
I'm not mentally ill, okay?
What's happening to me is real.

42:57.480 --> 43:01.792
Even assuming it is, what you're
asking is beyond my expertise.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.117
I've never performed an exorcism before,
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

43:06.200 --> 43:10.557
Well, you could read the book.
It would tell you what to do.

43:10.640 --> 43:12.119
And then what?

43:13.160 --> 43:15.071
For a religious ceremony to be effective,

43:15.160 --> 43:18.118
the person asking for help
has to actually believe

43:18.200 --> 43:20.919
in the spiritual aid
they're calling upon.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.837
And I'm guessing you don't believe.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.189
Look.

43:33.560 --> 43:38.111
Maybe I could do a little research.
I could make some calls.

43:38.880 --> 43:39.869
Okay.

43:41.960 --> 43:46.272
- What about your book?
- Can you translate it for me?

43:47.880 --> 43:51.509
Listen. My life depends on this.

43:53.080 --> 43:56.755
So please. Please help me.

44:08.840 --> 44:09.829
<i>Take this.</i>

44:10.480 --> 44:15.076
It is the hand of Miriam.
It may offer some protection.

44:17.760 --> 44:18.909
Stay away from mirrors.

44:19.480 --> 44:22.199
<i>If you have any in your home</i>
<i>you must destroy them.</i>

44:26.720 --> 44:31.999
<i>Burn the pieces of broken mirror</i>
<i>and then bury what remains.</i>

44:35.680 --> 44:40.390
<i>Bells, wind chimes,</i>
<i>these are signs that the spirit is near.</i>

44:45.360 --> 44:47.396
<i>You must be vigilant, Casey.</i>

44:48.160 --> 44:49.957
It will seek to isolate you.

44:50.640 --> 44:52.358
<i>To weaken your resolve.</i>

44:57.640 --> 44:58.755
Can it be killed?

44:59.960 --> 45:01.632
<i>It's already dead.</i>

45:03.560 --> 45:06.597
<i>The best you can hope for</i>
<i>is to drive it back again.</i>

45:10.640 --> 45:13.950
<i>There's no use</i>
<i>in trying to understand it, Casey.</i>

45:15.120 --> 45:17.076
<i>It's not human any more.</i>

45:19.000 --> 45:21.468
<i>It is an outsider now.</i>

45:23.160 --> 45:26.311
<i>It is no longer of this universe.</i>

46:27.320 --> 46:28.355
Oh, shit.

46:30.920 --> 46:32.239
Oh, my God.

46:40.680 --> 46:43.194
Oh, my God. Sweetie, are you okay?

46:43.280 --> 46:45.157
He doesn't want you to help her.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.952
If you try to help her, he'll kill you.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.077
Fuck off, you little shit.

47:09.440 --> 47:12.318
Oh, my God, Casey, I hit that kid
from across the street with my car,

47:12.400 --> 47:15.676
but then he was okay. I don't know.
I don't know.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.672
Something is seriously
wrong with that kid.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.228
Case, your eyes are getting worse.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.798
I know.

47:29.160 --> 47:32.072
Case? Dude, what's going on?

47:33.720 --> 47:37.156
You haven't been to class,
you're not returning my phone calls.

47:38.440 --> 47:42.194
- What happened to the mirror?
- I broke it.

47:44.680 --> 47:45.669
Why?

47:47.880 --> 47:49.836
Because Sofi told me to.

47:49.920 --> 47:53.674
- Case, that hag from the old people's home?
- She's my grandmother, Romy.

47:54.320 --> 47:55.309
What?

47:56.080 --> 47:58.389
She told me the truth about everything.

47:59.720 --> 48:00.709
My God.

48:01.640 --> 48:06.156
It's real. Everything that
has been happening is real.

48:06.960 --> 48:09.997
It's some kind of ghost
or demon or something.

48:10.080 --> 48:14.392
And it tried to take over my brother,
and that's why my mother went crazy.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.998
She knew
that it would eventually come after me.

48:18.680 --> 48:21.797
- It wants to be reborn into this world.
- Case...

48:21.880 --> 48:23.871
Listen to me, right now.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.755
You have to stay away from me.

48:27.400 --> 48:30.631
- What?
- It is not safe to be around me any more.

48:32.720 --> 48:37.919
No, no, no. I am your best friend, okay?

48:39.280 --> 48:42.352
And I am not gonna just abandon you.

48:44.080 --> 48:45.672
Okay? It's okay.

50:14.560 --> 50:15.595
Mom?

50:54.560 --> 50:57.916
I am thankful to you, Eternal King,

50:58.000 --> 51:01.754
who has mercifully
returned my soul within me.

51:01.840 --> 51:04.354
Your faithfulness is great. Amen.

51:53.880 --> 51:54.869
Eli?

52:21.960 --> 52:23.313
Eli?

52:43.360 --> 52:44.395
Eli?

54:47.120 --> 54:48.758
Miss Beldon?

54:51.520 --> 54:54.557
Miss Beldon,
Sofi wanted you to have this.

54:55.040 --> 54:58.032
- In case anything happened.
- Thank you.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.869
<i>Dear Casey,</i>

55:09.960 --> 55:14.397
<i>it has fallen upon you to finish</i>
<i>what began in Auschwitz.</i>

55:16.000 --> 55:20.152
<i>Be careful.
The dybbuk feeds on fear.</i>

55:21.120 --> 55:24.556
<i>It has a taste for our
family's blood now.</i>

55:24.640 --> 55:27.837
<i>And it won't rest until
it's had its revenge.</i>

55:28.480 --> 55:32.029
<i>I tried to stop it,</i>
<i>and your mother did as well,</i>

55:32.120 --> 55:35.510
<i>but she lost the battle.</i>
<i>She gave in to her fear.</i>

55:36.640 --> 55:40.519
<i>Whatever happens, don't let it</i>
<i>turn you against yourself.</i>

55:41.760 --> 55:44.399
<i>It will seek to isolate you</i>

55:44.480 --> 55:48.155
<i>by attacking your
friends, your family.</i>

55:48.240 --> 55:51.232
<i>But it is you that it most desires.</i>

57:54.000 --> 57:55.877
Get out of here! Go!

58:20.480 --> 58:22.311
Maybe it's not even really after you.

58:22.640 --> 58:25.757
<i>- It killed my mother.</i>
- You don't know that.

58:25.840 --> 58:29.276
<i>Yes, I do.
And now, it's killed Sofi, too.</i>

58:29.560 --> 58:32.632
It's gonna take everybody that I love
away from me.

58:33.160 --> 58:35.435
That's what it does.
It's gonna wear me down,

58:35.520 --> 58:37.636
and then, when I don't have
any strength left to fight it,

58:37.720 --> 58:39.472
that's when it's gonna come for me.

58:40.200 --> 58:43.431
- I don't know, maybe you should leave town.
<i>- No, no, it wouldn't help.</i>

58:44.080 --> 58:47.231
It's gonna follow me wherever I go.
It's gonna kill me, Romy.

58:50.400 --> 58:52.356
Hold on for a second, dude,
someone's at my door.

58:52.440 --> 58:54.158
No, no, no. Don't answer that.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.994
<i>- Casey?</i>
- Mark!

59:19.080 --> 59:20.593
Meet me at Romy's house.
Something's wrong.

59:20.680 --> 59:22.511
<i>- What? What are you...</i>
- Do it! Go!

59:55.720 --> 59:58.314
- The doorway is open.
- What?

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.675
Romy!
- What? What?

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.954
She's not answering the door.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.275
Go back! Around back!
Come on, come on, come on!

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.229
No!

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.435
- I told you not to help her.
- Please. Please.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.070
All right, let's go. Here, come on.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:50.835
Romy!

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:58.313
No! Mark, stop! Stop!

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.037
It's not in him any more.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.233
Get Matty. Get Matty, let's go.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.759
Let's go! Move!

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.475
Shit!

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.353
It's my fault.
It killed her because of me.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.674
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.157
It's not like us. I don't even think
that it comes from the same universe.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.834
- But you can sense when it's near?
- Yes.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.754
It's getting stronger, Mark.
And I can feel it everywhere.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.593
And I think that it's strong enough
to enter anyone now.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.109
Even the dead.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.513
- So no place is safe.
- No.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.517
No, see, I don't think
that the world was ever safe.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.628
I think that we were always just trying
to pretend like it was,

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.119
but it's not.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.956
I like that. That's good.
That's what I need to see.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.473
Why did you change your mind?

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.120
You know, I can't say that I truly
believe in what's afflicting you,

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.430
but I think you believe.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.715
And if you're convinced
an exorcism is what you need,

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.518
then who am I to turn you away?

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.990
If you'd seen what I saw last night,
you wouldn't have any problem believing.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.875
- So, why are we meeting here?
- Because we need backup.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.638
I may be a man of God,
but I'm not a miracle worker.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.918
Good to see you, Joe.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.039
- This is Casey.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.519
- Mark.
- Hey, Mark.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.319
And this is Arthur Wyndham.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.836
He is an Episcopal priest
and a very, very dear friend of mine.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.638
So you've done exorcisms?

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.032
No, I studied the phenomenon,
I did my dissertation on it back in college.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.671
Just wait a second. I'm not looking
for a Christian exorcism here.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.069
Fair enough.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.952
But there are certain elements
to these kind of rites that are

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.955
pretty common to virtually all religions, and
it's these elements that I'm familiar with.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.232
You gotta understand,
this thing that's after you,

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.791
if it exists, it predates religion.
It probably predates mankind.

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.839
It's not as if there's one kind of demon
that is vulnerable to Jewish prayer,

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.196
or another that's allergic to Christian or Muslim.
It doesn't actually work that way.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.555
So the words in that book,
they can't help me.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:06.873
No, no, no. On the contrary, I think that it
can, but not in a way that you might think.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.989
Now you, you may not believe,

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.550
but your mother and your grandmother did.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:19.431
And it's because of their belief
that these words give us the best shot

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.357
at driving this thing out.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.555
I've translated what's in the book,

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.599
so I'll be leading the invocation and Arthur
and a few others will be assisting us.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.477
Yeah. Yeah, but before we get started,

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:34.270
there's a few formalities
that we have to get out of the way.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.398
Can I see your IDs, please?

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.951
I gotta verify that you're of legal age
to consent to this.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.758
- All right.
- You kidding?

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.875
- No.
- No?

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:49.557
Not kidding. These are the forms, actually.
I don't know if they're legally binding,

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.872
but we're in murky waters here,
just in case something does go wrong.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.472
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.872
- Great. So when do we do this?
- Tomorrow night. Sabbath.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.955
- At your synagogue?
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.676
Given how unorthodox this all is,
I think we'll find another venue.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.231
Yeah, yeah. Is there somewhere
that is particularly negative to you?

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.914
Somewhere that
you may have incurred a lot of pain?

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.791
- Hell of a place to get religious, Sendak.
- Cheery, isn't it?

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.716
This is Rick Hesse, he's an EMT.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.314
I thought it would be a good idea
to have him here, just in case.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.630
Nice to meet you.
- As for the other volunteers,

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.599
they've all been through some kind of
hardship and they're willing to help.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:15.672
Now, typically, a Jewish exorcism rite
involves 10 people.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.909
Why 10?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.195
10 fingers, 10 commandments.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.558
10 is also the number of the <i>Sephiroth,</i>
which are the known attributes of God.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.358
The idea is that these 10

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.079
form a protective circle
around the afflicted person.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.358
Yeah, once we get going,
Casey will stand in the middle of the circle,

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.874
Sendak will read the
original text in Hebrew,

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.077
and the rest of you will follow me
in English, call and response format.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:44.633
Now the heart of the ceremony is Psalm 91.
<i>Yoshev B'seter,</i> the Psalm of Protection.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.269
At the beginning and the end of
the invocation, I'll sound the <i>shofar,</i>

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.352
which is an animal horn
used in religious ceremonies.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.468
In this case, the sound is intended to
shock the spirit hiding within the victim.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.075
Once the spirit is more compliant,
then we can start drawing it out.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.912
That's when the rest of us
are the most vulnerable.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.515
It wants Casey,
but it will take any port in the storm.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.876
And remember, no matter what happens,
once we've begun,

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:13.270
the exorcism must be finished.
Any questions?

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.193
Yeah, why are they bringing in a gurney?

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.679
The gurney is for Casey's protection
as well as ours.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:27.275
Sometimes people thrash out,
just a precaution. That's all.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.788
All right then. Let's get started.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.029
Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.553
I just want this to be over.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.311
My name is Arthur Wyndham,
and this is the video record

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:59.439
of the attempted
exorcism of Casey Beldon.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.548
We have the permission of the ecclesiastical
authority who are praying for us.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:10.230
Everyone participating tonight is here
of their own free will, including Casey.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.197
- Agreed?
- Yes.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.158
- Just for the camera.
- Yes, this is what I want.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.590
Now, if... And this is a big if.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:22.036
But assuming a spirit
actually manifests itself on your person,

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:26.511
it may take the shape of a kind of bulge
beneath the flesh.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.874
Now try not to be alarmed by this.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.916
Even though we're dealing
with a spiritual phenomenon,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.560
the entity still needs to be housed
in some degree of physical mass.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.758
So if your body produces a reaction like
that, it means what we're doing is working.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.990
- I understand.
- All right.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.353
Okay, so we're gonna
place this block in your mouth,

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:46.591
- so you don't bite on your tongue.
- Let's just get on with this.

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:48.269
Okay.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.669
The circle is now made whole and sacred.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.835
"In the name of Adonai, God of Israel.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.037
"May Michael be by my right,
Gabriel at my left,

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.078
"Uriel before me, Raphael behind me.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.118
"Beneath my feet the ground of God."

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:04.034
"I say to you of the Lord
who is my refuge and my stronghold,

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.429
"my God in whom I trust,

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.512
"that he will save you
from the fowler's snare

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.875
"and destructive pestilence."

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:26.875
"He will cover you with his feathers
and you will find refuge under his wings.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.068
"His truth will be your shield and armour."

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.879
Keep going.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.113
Don't stop reading.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.393
"You will not fear the terror of the
night nor the arrow that flies by day."

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.838
<i>The doorway is open.</i>

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.670
Get me out of here! Come on!

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.434
- Get me out of here! Get me out!
- Come on!

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.509
Let's go, let's go.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.679
No, no, no, wait. The page.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.069
What? Forget it! Let's go!
- We have to finish it.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.229
Come on!

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.912
Oh, God. Oh, God. I think he's gone.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.949
No!

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.469
No!

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.832
Baby, we gotta go. Get up, baby.
Come on. God.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.196
Baby. Baby, you're hurting me.
Mark, stop it.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.509
Mark!

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.278
"...ten thousand at your right,

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.237

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.556
"No evil will befall you,
