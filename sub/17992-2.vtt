00:22.489 --> 00:23.923
{\an5}I just wanna know that
me and you can get along.

00:23.990 --> 00:27.160
{\an5}I don't have to get along
with you if I don't want to.

00:27.227 --> 00:29.696
{\an5}You're taking it
personal but it's not personal.

00:29.763 --> 00:30.997
{\an5}It is personal.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.766
{\an5}Is you really serious
about the moving in?

00:32.832 --> 00:35.668

00:48.348 --> 00:49.983
{\an5}I don't know if she
threw the bag away or not.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.584
{\an5}I might sock that bitch in
the face when I see her.

00:51.651 --> 00:52.852

threw that [beep] away.

01:36.696 --> 01:41.734
So I just wanna say, like,
a check needs to be cut.

01:41.801 --> 01:42.902
A check?

01:42.969 --> 01:44.137
Are you for real?

01:44.204 --> 01:45.271
Oh I'm positive.

01:45.338 --> 01:46.406
Like, you keep like.

01:46.473 --> 01:47.640
You threw my [bleep] away.

01:47.707 --> 01:48.741
I'm like, thanks for coming.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.009
You threw my [bleep] away.

01:50.076 --> 01:50.677
Did you not?

01:50.743 --> 01:51.478
That was in the bag?

01:51.544 --> 01:52.412
Did you not?

01:52.479 --> 01:53.847
No, this ain't got
nothing to do with you.

01:53.913 --> 01:55.315
Is that what was in the bag?

01:55.381 --> 01:56.216
No.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.050
Yeah it was.

01:57.116 --> 01:58.017
Well okay, so wait wait wait.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.890
Is that what was in the bag?

02:03.957 --> 02:04.858
Babe, babe, babe, babe.

02:04.924 --> 02:06.359
Maybe, but what about it?

02:06.426 --> 02:08.261
To be honest, I didn't even want
to come to this whack ass

02:08.328 --> 02:10.263
RayJ.com party.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.932
The only reason I came is so
that Ray can either give me my

02:12.999 --> 02:15.368
things back, or either pay me.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.070
Then his psycho bitch
just wants to walk up

02:17.136 --> 02:18.938
in my face acting crazy.

02:19.005 --> 02:20.173
Bitch, you met your match.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.041
I'lll show you crazy.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.578
What about it?

02:25.645 --> 02:26.446
Bitch!

02:26.513 --> 02:28.248
Don't ever come at
me like that, ho.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.115
What you doing?

02:29.182 --> 02:30.917
No, I don't give a
[bleep] about her.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.553
I should have grabbed her by her
head and banged her [bleep]

02:33.620 --> 02:35.455
{\an5}head into the concrete.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.123
{\an5}But I didn't do that.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.958
I think I'm growing here.

02:39.726 --> 02:40.827
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe.

02:40.894 --> 02:41.561
What?

02:41.628 --> 02:42.595
She's mad because...

02:42.662 --> 02:43.830
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe.

02:43.897 --> 02:44.964
She threw a glass at me.

02:45.031 --> 02:46.199
I know, I will
take care of that.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.569
I invited you to my [bleep]
and this is how you repay me?

02:49.636 --> 02:50.803
{\an5}[bleep] you gotta go.

02:50.870 --> 02:51.404
Let me talk to you.

02:51.471 --> 02:52.539
Come on.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.240
Listen, we're just talking.

02:54.307 --> 02:55.375
We're good.

02:55.441 --> 02:58.077
{\an5}Ray J's old girlfriend,
Teairra, and his new girlfriend,

02:58.144 --> 03:00.079
{\an5}Princess, are going at it.

03:00.146 --> 03:01.347
I'm trying to get through
security, because at the end of

03:01.414 --> 03:03.416
the day I'm still
trying to talk to her.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.617
This is my [bleep] party.

03:04.684 --> 03:08.187
I put this party together,
and they're [bleep]

03:08.254 --> 03:08.755
here ruining it.

03:08.821 --> 03:09.822
I always had your back.

03:09.889 --> 03:10.490
Always.

03:10.557 --> 03:11.190
Wait, hold on.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.025
You're not gonna go fight her.

03:12.091 --> 03:13.092
You're not gonna go fight her.

03:13.159 --> 03:14.627
That's not, that's
what's not gonna happen.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.129
That's, let's chill out on that.

03:16.195 --> 03:19.399
But what I'm sayin' is, I
always had your [bleep] back.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.534
Okay, so my friend.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.368
Stop touching me, Teairra.

03:22.435 --> 03:23.403
Stop, 'cause you're...

03:23.469 --> 03:24.604
I'm gonna touch you
'cause you're touching me.

03:24.671 --> 03:25.405
No, 'cause you always get
physical, that's what I'm sayin'

03:25.471 --> 03:26.272
and I...

03:26.339 --> 03:27.106
No, baby.

03:27.173 --> 03:27.640
No, sweetie,
listen let's just talk.

03:27.707 --> 03:28.274
All right.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.475
Let's just talk.

03:29.542 --> 03:29.909
I'm good.

03:29.976 --> 03:30.476
Let's just talk.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.344
Well then don't talk.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.145
We don't have to
talk, it is what it is.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.313
Just don't get physical.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.914
She keeps [bleep] grabbing me.

03:34.981 --> 03:37.183
And that's the [bleep]
I don't like.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.886
If I'm not allowing you to touch
me, don't [bleep] touch me.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.822
Ray, I told you not to
invite this bitch, yo.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.824
Are you kidding me?

03:44.891 --> 03:46.259
Bitch, I was there for
you when you had no

03:46.326 --> 03:49.162
[bleep] body, Morgan.

03:49.228 --> 03:49.963
You're out of line.

03:50.029 --> 03:50.797
That [bleep] bitch
was out of line.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.165
You're out of line.

03:52.231 --> 03:53.766
You out of line.

03:53.833 --> 03:54.400
Get the [bleep] outta here.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.436
Get me out of here, stop.

03:56.502 --> 03:59.339
Get the [bleep] out of this
party right the [bleep] now.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.807
That's how I feel.

04:00.873 --> 04:01.741
[bleep] that ho.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.077
Like, I want her to
come out right now.

04:04.143 --> 04:07.614
I am a little mad at my supposed
friend for flippin' out on me,

04:07.680 --> 04:09.515
but I'm more
pissed with Ray's ho.

04:09.582 --> 04:14.854
If she steps in a radius of
me, lookie loo, whoopty woo.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.255
Hey!

04:16.322 --> 04:17.055
Ho!

04:17.123 --> 04:19.192
Hey you [bleep] slut ass ho.

04:19.257 --> 04:20.293
Come on.

04:20.360 --> 04:28.835
{\an5}♪♪

04:28.901 --> 04:29.636
Hey girl.

04:29.702 --> 04:30.837
Hey.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.505
I've known Apryl for a while
now, since we both ended up

04:32.572 --> 04:35.108
{\an5}dating ex B2K members.

04:35.174 --> 04:38.511
{\an5}She's super cool, and I
think she's great for Omari.

04:38.578 --> 04:39.979
Girl, what is you lookin' at?

04:40.046 --> 04:42.281
I'm doing a little
research, 'cause you know

04:42.348 --> 04:44.017
I'm coming out with a toy line.

04:44.083 --> 04:44.817
For real?

04:44.884 --> 04:45.618
That's so awesome.

04:45.685 --> 04:46.686
Yes, and I'm so excited.

04:46.753 --> 04:47.687
It's all coming together.

04:47.754 --> 04:48.821
But wait, let's talk about this.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.190
'Cause are you ready to
like drop any second?

04:51.257 --> 04:54.594
Yeah, about a month left
and then he's gonna be here.

04:54.661 --> 04:55.728
So I'm so excited.

04:55.795 --> 04:56.396
You ready?

04:56.462 --> 04:57.096
Yeah.

04:57.163 --> 04:58.031
I'm horny.

04:58.097 --> 04:59.699
I'm horny, I'm
like really horny.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.035
And now that I'm even more horny
because all I'm seeing is little

05:02.101 --> 05:04.604
[bleep] everywhere.

05:04.671 --> 05:05.905
You need some help.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.509
Moniece is beautiful, smart,
and she's always grinding.

05:09.575 --> 05:12.578
But if she marketed her sex
toy line towards horny pregnant

05:12.645 --> 05:15.748
women like me,
she'd really be rich.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.650
Look at this,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

05:17.717 --> 05:18.418
No.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.485
I don't want none of that.

05:19.552 --> 05:20.353
So what else?

05:20.420 --> 05:21.754
What else has been
going on with you?

05:21.821 --> 05:25.925
Like, what's been
going on with Fizz?

05:25.992 --> 05:27.593
Speaking of [bleep] honey.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.429
[laughter]

05:29.495 --> 05:31.397
That is a hot mess.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.231
That whole situation.

05:32.298 --> 05:33.700
So y'all not on good terms?

05:33.766 --> 05:34.801
He's disrespectful.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.369
He's always been disrespectful.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.137
That's why we're not together.

05:38.204 --> 05:40.773
From what I know from Omari,
Moniece and Fizz have kind

05:40.840 --> 05:42.475
of been through some things.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.243
I'm not surprised.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.812
But what I am surprised about
is that Moniece isn't involved

05:45.878 --> 05:48.214
in her child's life
a little bit more.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.716
But who am I to judge.

05:49.782 --> 05:53.219
So Cameron came home from
his dad's and he was like

05:53.286 --> 05:56.155
"Daddy has a girlfriend and
her name is Amanda."

05:56.222 --> 05:57.523
Oh...

05:57.590 --> 06:02.428
And I heard that you and
Amanda are acquainted.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.731
Have been getting
to know one another.

06:04.797 --> 06:08.568
Well you know, I've met
Amanda through Fizz obviously,

06:08.634 --> 06:10.369
because Omari and Fizz and all.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.305
It was like okay
hi, nice to meet you.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.607
But I think that she seems nice.

06:14.674 --> 06:15.875
You know what I'm sayin'?

06:15.942 --> 06:18.044
I've been trying to reach out
to her because I think there's a

06:18.111 --> 06:22.448
lot that we need, you know, to
discuss and she wants to play

06:22.515 --> 06:23.916
mommy dearest.

06:23.983 --> 06:27.353
I don't care who Drew is
sleeping with, dating, seeing,

06:27.420 --> 06:29.889
spending time with, whatever.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.390
But this chick has been around
for a while, which means

06:31.457 --> 06:33.726
she's obviously been
spending time with my son.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.429
So I think it's time I sit down
with her, lay down some

06:36.496 --> 06:38.765
ground rules, set some
boundaries so that there's

06:38.831 --> 06:40.600
absolutely no confusion.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.201
So you reached out to her?

06:42.268 --> 06:44.370
Yeah, I'm just
waiting to hear back.

06:44.437 --> 06:45.638
What is this gonna look like?

06:45.705 --> 06:48.908
I wanna go into it with an open
mind, but I do need to put my

06:48.975 --> 06:51.677
foot down and let that bitch
know, like, pump your brakes.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.412
Don't do that, because you're
gonna, you need to really

06:53.479 --> 06:56.382
need to go into it
seriously, like be nice.

06:56.449 --> 06:59.886
I don't have any intentions on
going there moping the floor

06:59.952 --> 07:05.124
with her face or her ass or
any other part of her body.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.826
I just wanna have
a conversation.

07:06.893 --> 07:09.896
As long as Amanda understands
that I demand my respect,

07:09.962 --> 07:12.031
if she has any intentions
of being around my son

07:12.098 --> 07:14.100
then we won't have any problems.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.303
She just needs to make sure that
she understands I am his mother.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.273
Period, point blank.

07:20.339 --> 07:27.847
{\an5}♪♪

07:27.914 --> 07:30.716
So, me and Amanda have been
together for about two years and

07:30.783 --> 07:33.019
I love how career driven she is.

07:33.085 --> 07:36.689
How family orientated she
is, and how humble she is.

07:36.756 --> 07:37.723
Ready for bed?

07:37.790 --> 07:38.791
Yeah.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.594
[laughter]

07:41.661 --> 07:42.528
Say goodnight.

07:42.595 --> 07:44.497
Loving me comes
with a whole lot.

07:44.564 --> 07:47.600
I have a four year old son who
I have primary custody of,

07:47.667 --> 07:51.437
and also, I have a very
outrageous baby momma.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.106
I've been asking Amanda to step
up to the plate and help me out

07:54.173 --> 07:55.808
with my son, Cameron.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.110
I know it may be a little
scary to her, but I think

07:58.177 --> 08:00.146
she's starting to warm
up to it a little bit.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.516
I mean, who could deny
our adorable faces, right?

08:03.583 --> 08:05.885
You know I had to cook you
something, 'cause I just,

08:05.952 --> 08:07.820
I appreciate you
finally stepping up.

08:07.887 --> 08:11.591
I feel like you really are
trying and working on it.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.959
And I appreciate it.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.927
See, I've been good, right?

08:14.994 --> 08:15.862
A little bit.

08:15.928 --> 08:16.629
Babe.

08:16.696 --> 08:17.330
I gotta see a little more.

08:17.396 --> 08:18.698
No, I have been good.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.833
It's like you
should get your stuff.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.235
Like you staying at
your mom's place.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.004
Grab your stuff, and
clean out half of the closet.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.372
Put your stuff in there.

08:26.439 --> 08:27.940
Like really be real about it.

08:28.007 --> 08:28.708
I am trying.

08:28.774 --> 08:29.909
You see that I'm trying.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.445
There's a lot of things, you
know, scaring me, you know,

08:32.510 --> 08:33.712
overwhelm me a little bit.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.881
And I don't wanna, I don't want
you to think I'm like freaking

08:35.948 --> 08:40.586
out, but I don't know how to be
a mom and take care of a kid.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.089
But that's, I'm here with you.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.657
What could possibly scare you?

08:44.724 --> 08:45.791
Baby momma drama.

08:45.858 --> 08:46.592
Like that's new to me.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.962
I've never dealt
with a baby momma.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.364
{\an5}I love Drew, and I know he
wants to take our relationship

08:51.430 --> 08:52.798
{\an5}to the next level.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.268
{\an5}But from what he's told me,
Moniece isn't easy to deal with.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.937
We've never met, let alone have
a real conversation, and maybe

08:58.004 --> 09:00.006
it's time to change that.

09:00.072 --> 09:06.145
So, Moniece reached out to me,
and she wants to meet and talk.

09:06.212 --> 09:06.979
Whoa, whoa.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.047
Why are you laughing like that?

09:08.114 --> 09:10.416
What do you mean she
reached out to you?

09:10.483 --> 09:11.550
Well she emailed me...

09:11.617 --> 09:13.019
Mmm hmm.

09:13.085 --> 09:13.719
And she wants to meet
and have a conversation

09:13.786 --> 09:15.221
and I think we should.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.289
I think that's a
really bad idea.

09:16.355 --> 09:17.156
Why?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.660
She's very spiteful, first off.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.628
And she reacts off emotion.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.130
Maybe she's
growing up a little bit?

09:24.196 --> 09:25.765
I just feel like
she's, it's a bad idea.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.266
Like, she might snap
on you or something.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.534
She might...

09:28.601 --> 09:31.237
No, she's not, she's an adult
and I'm an adult, and we're can,

09:31.304 --> 09:33.406
we should be able to sit down
and have a normal conversation.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.442
I'm glad you feel like she's
very sane, and I'm glad you feel

09:36.509 --> 09:40.112
like you can work it out and be
mature, and you know, to

09:40.179 --> 09:41.614
have that conversation
but I just feel like...

09:41.681 --> 09:43.182
But this is
important to me and I...

09:43.249 --> 09:44.417
It's dangerous.

09:44.483 --> 09:46.052
I really don't think Amanda
knows what she's getting herself

09:46.118 --> 09:49.021
into, meeting up
with my baby momma.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.390
I just know that Moniece
can't keep things civil.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.659
I'm a little at odds right now.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.800
It'll be fine, just relax.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.135
{\an8}That's what you need to stop.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.036
{\an8}You know, like when you
drink you're a completely

10:04.103 --> 10:05.171
{\an8}different a person.

10:05.237 --> 10:08.040
{\an8}When I'm on top of you, or
you're in between my legs,

10:08.107 --> 10:10.576
{\an8}that's more than
just a friendship.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.244
{\an8}Me and Drew have been together
for two years and I'm in

10:12.311 --> 10:14.347
{\an8}Cameron's life,
whether you know it or not.

10:14.413 --> 10:16.615
{\an8}What I want you to do is,
worry about getting [bleep]

10:16.682 --> 10:18.117
{\an8}and let me worry about my child.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.752
{\an8}Right bitch, don't
come at me like that.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.120
{\an8}I don't give a
[bleep] who you got up

10:21.187 --> 10:22.121
{\an8}in this mother [bleep].

10:22.188 --> 10:23.155
{\an8}You want it like that though?

10:39.005 --> 10:42.274
My name is Nikki, some people
like to call me Miss Nikki baby.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.944
My dad is Arabic-Italian
and my mom is Moroccan.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.979
No one's lacking
anything in our family.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.015
They've owned a lot of
night clubs and real estate

10:49.081 --> 10:51.117
for about 35 years now.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.352
I'm in line to run
the family empire.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.721
I'm smart, I have a
really strong personality,

10:55.788 --> 10:56.889
I'm pretty much a bod.

10:56.956 --> 11:06.499
{\an5}♪♪

11:06.565 --> 11:08.734
{\an5}I currently manage three
of my family's strip clubs.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.936
I'm a very hands on manager.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.171
Every single night of
the week I'm there.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.573
I take care of my VIP clientele.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.276
Because of that, I'm very well
respected and well connected

11:17.343 --> 11:18.644
in the music industry.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.646
{\an5}I've been dating one of the
hottest producers in the game.

11:20.713 --> 11:21.947
{\an5}He goes by Mally Mall.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.916
We've been together for
about almost two years.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.252
You know, right now we're kind
of sort of broken up and you

11:26.318 --> 11:27.787
know we play that
game back and forth.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.088
We break up to make up.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.524
My man knows he
can't live without me.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.993
But tonight, I'm gonna meet an
old friend of mine, Sincere.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.594
Give me a hug.

11:35.661 --> 11:37.696
Sincere is one of the
hottest promoters in L.A.

11:37.763 --> 11:40.132
What's up, what's up
with you Miss Nikki baby?

11:40.199 --> 11:40.966
We've been busy.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.169
We've been having a lot of fun.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.204
And you know, lately I've been
kind of wanting to reach into

11:45.271 --> 11:47.606
the music video business,
so I wanted to see what he

11:47.673 --> 11:48.741
could do for me.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.876
So listen, I wanted
to ask you something.

11:50.943 --> 11:53.279
I've got some girls, I got about
3 girls, they're real cute,

11:53.345 --> 11:57.283
and they wanna show off their
little dancing moves, whatever.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.384
So I figured, since you're
the man around town,

11:58.451 --> 11:59.452
you got your hands
in everything.

11:59.518 --> 12:00.686
I do.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.254
Maybe we could just
set something up.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.790
Like they could be in a video
and dance or whatever it is,

12:04.857 --> 12:05.658
you know what I mean?

12:05.724 --> 12:06.692
My boy's actually
shootin' a video.

12:06.759 --> 12:07.827
Okay, cool.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.095
We'll set up something,
get your girls in there.

12:09.161 --> 12:10.696
You hustlin' out here.

12:10.763 --> 12:11.764
What you doin?

12:11.831 --> 12:12.865
Yeah, I mean, you
know, I'm single now.

12:12.932 --> 12:14.300
Technically.

12:14.366 --> 12:15.501
I been hearing some stuff.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.570
Well you know, Mall
been in Vegas and stuff.

12:17.636 --> 12:20.539
He just tryin' to act like he
just doesn't have time for me.

12:20.606 --> 12:22.007
I'm like, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

12:22.074 --> 12:22.741
That's crazy.

12:22.808 --> 12:23.843
That's crazy.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.177
Excuse me, like,
who the [bleep]

12:25.244 --> 12:26.112
wouldn't make time for me?

12:26.178 --> 12:27.113
Like, you know what I mean?

12:27.179 --> 12:28.481
Like, I'm just
like, I'm so confused.

12:28.547 --> 12:31.750
He is a cool guy, but you
know, he don't seem too smart.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.552
He's been trying to
work his way back.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.856
He gave me this ring, and he
sent me these flowers over here.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.824
You know, he's making these
little gestures, but you know

12:38.891 --> 12:40.626
I just, I just, I
don't know right now.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.027
You should take a long break.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.295
Why?

12:43.362 --> 12:44.597
I like single Nikki.

12:44.663 --> 12:45.498
You know what I'm sayin?

12:45.564 --> 12:51.137
[laughter]

12:51.203 --> 12:54.974
{\an5}♪♪

12:55.040 --> 12:56.542
You know me as Young Berg.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.644
My family and friends
know me as Christian.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.913
But right now you can
call me hit maker, you know?

13:00.980 --> 13:03.916
I started as a rapper, had
multiple hits, sold about

13:03.983 --> 13:06.252
10 million singles.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.487
I wrote and I produced all my
records and I decided to get

13:08.554 --> 13:10.990
my producing and
song writing on.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.925
Currently, you
know, I sign talent.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.160
I sign artists.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.594
I sign producers.

13:15.661 --> 13:18.030
And then deeper than that, I'm
working with the whole game.

13:18.097 --> 13:22.001
Lil Wayne, Rick
Ross, Neat Neil, Puff.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.536
I'm working on his new album.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.538
I'm working on Nicki
Minaj's new album.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.439
I'm working on
Rihanna's new album.

13:27.506 --> 13:30.543
So hey man, if you wanna hit,
you gotta come holla at me.

13:30.609 --> 13:34.547
{\an5}♪♪

13:34.613 --> 13:36.615
I met Young Berg when I
was still a publicist and

13:36.682 --> 13:38.551
{\an5}he was just Christian.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.086
He was still out here trying
to make a name for himself.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.822
We always had this great
chemistry and one thing led

13:43.889 --> 13:47.193
to another and we've been
rockin' for a really long time.

13:47.259 --> 13:51.363
Unfortunately, Berg
doesn't like to be exclusive.

13:51.430 --> 13:55.067
He likes to keep
his options open.

13:55.134 --> 13:57.870
{\an5}♪♪

13:57.937 --> 13:59.338
Is that Hazel-E?

13:59.405 --> 14:02.107
Yeah baby.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.310
Berg and I have been
working on my new single.

14:04.376 --> 14:06.612
But today, we ain't
talkin' bout music.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.315
I wanna holla about us.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.183
We've been messin' around for
such a long time, I think

14:11.250 --> 14:13.018
it's time for us to get an
understanding about what's

14:13.085 --> 14:14.720
really going on with us.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.021
What's up, baby?

14:16.088 --> 14:20.059
You know, I wanted
to come holla at you.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.895
I feel like we've been
[bleep] around for a minute.

14:22.962 --> 14:25.264
We clearly got
feelings for each other.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.866
Like, we wouldn't be
friends this long if we didn't.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.569
We clearly are attracted
to each other.

14:30.636 --> 14:31.971
Yo, what
you want from me?

14:32.037 --> 14:32.805
I feel like...

14:32.871 --> 14:33.772
I'm listening, come on.

14:33.839 --> 14:34.707
Tell me, talk to me.

14:34.773 --> 14:35.674
Yeah, sit on Mommy's lap.

14:35.741 --> 14:37.343
Oh [bleep].

14:37.409 --> 14:39.578
You better say the right
things while I'm laying here.

14:39.645 --> 14:40.512
Come on.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.281
What do you need from me?

14:42.348 --> 14:44.283
I need you to one, get me right.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.684
And two, hold me down.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.119
It's simple.

14:47.186 --> 14:50.189
I ain't gonna front, like our
sexual chemistry crazy, but she

14:50.256 --> 14:54.126
always wants just a little bit
more then I'm able to offer her.

14:54.193 --> 14:57.630
Because like, as far as what
we doing in real life and in

14:57.696 --> 15:00.266
these streets, that
ain't what's cracking.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.167
You know me, when
it comes to women.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.271
On Monday I see one, on
Tuesday I see another.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.072
On Wednesday it
might be another woman.

15:07.139 --> 15:08.607
On Thursday it
might be another woman.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.309
On Friday it's
gonna be another woman.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.578
I double up on Saturday and
I rest on the sabbath

15:12.645 --> 15:13.779
like Jesus Christ.

15:13.846 --> 15:14.913
You see I'm in all
white right now.

15:14.980 --> 15:15.914
You know what I'm sayin?

15:15.981 --> 15:16.615
Right.

15:16.682 --> 15:17.983
You in it too, you in the mix.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.853
See I'm not, I'm
not okay with that.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.121
Oh, you love me though.

15:22.187 --> 15:23.355
I do.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.690
Okay, so if you love me, you
gotta deal with the way

15:24.757 --> 15:27.092
I wanna do [bleep], baby.

15:27.159 --> 15:29.762
We've lasted almost 10
years by being friends.

15:29.828 --> 15:30.796
[bleep] the friendship.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.398
Mmm hmm.

15:32.464 --> 15:35.734
'Cause when I'm on top of you,
or you're in between my legs,

15:35.801 --> 15:37.670
that's more than
just a friendship.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.606
All right, so look.

15:40.673 --> 15:44.143
If we go in and do that,
and if you're trying to work,

15:44.209 --> 15:46.512
then we really gotta be
on the same page.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.314
Not that we aren't
right now, 'cause we are.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.115
We know...

15:50.182 --> 15:52.418
See that's all you think about.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.487
Like, you know it's good
but like, but come on,

15:55.554 --> 15:57.356
what if I took it away?

15:57.423 --> 15:58.590
The [bleep].

15:58.657 --> 16:00.059
You would feel like you
gotta take some [bleep]

16:00.125 --> 16:01.427
away from me for us to do this?

16:01.493 --> 16:03.462
I don't wanna take it away,
but I do want you to step the

16:03.529 --> 16:06.632
[bleep] up and hold me down.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.700
Seriously.

16:07.766 --> 16:10.069
Well let's, let's,
let's marinate on this.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.603
Let me take this all in
and let's just work on

16:11.670 --> 16:12.638
being better people.

16:12.705 --> 16:16.942
But I wanna work on
being a better us.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.510
I'm down.

16:18.577 --> 16:19.611
You down?

16:19.678 --> 16:20.579
Uh huh.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.715
Nobody takes the
[bleep] away from hit maker.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.117
When I want the
[bleep], I get the [bleep].

16:25.184 --> 16:26.819
When I don't want the
[bleep], I leave the

16:26.885 --> 16:28.287
[bleep] at the house.

16:28.354 --> 16:30.022
You feel me?

16:30.089 --> 16:31.323
Hazel, if you wanna play
games, I play the game

16:31.390 --> 16:32.725
better than anybody.

16:32.791 --> 16:35.527
I'm working on being a better
[bleep], 'cause I know that we

16:35.594 --> 16:37.029
care about each other.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.798
I'm gonna do my best, and put
my best foot forth for that.

16:39.865 --> 16:45.003
Okay.

16:45.070 --> 16:49.108
{\an5}♪♪

16:49.174 --> 16:51.844
So I kind of lost my cool at
Ray's party because of his $2

16:51.910 --> 16:54.413
ass bitch, but I don't feel
good about getting

16:54.480 --> 16:55.814
into it with Morgan.

16:55.881 --> 16:58.917
So when she hit me up to come
and talk, I was totally down.

16:58.984 --> 17:00.619
How you doing?

17:00.686 --> 17:01.620
I'm good, how are you?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.655
I'm good.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.391
Morgan and I go back a lot of
years, and once upon a time

17:05.457 --> 17:08.127
we were really cool, until
things started getting shaky

17:08.193 --> 17:09.361
with me and Ray.

17:09.428 --> 17:12.231
But now I just wanna put Ray
and everything that got [bleep]

17:12.297 --> 17:13.999
up because of him, behind me.

17:14.066 --> 17:17.035
And maybe this is a start.

17:17.102 --> 17:20.506
Obviously there's beyond
a lot of tension going on.

17:20.571 --> 17:24.542
I feel like I worked so hard to
put that party together, and...

17:24.609 --> 17:25.676
You saw what went down.

17:25.743 --> 17:28.847
His girlfriend
came up to me, okay.

17:28.914 --> 17:31.917
With her phone, flashing
her phone in my face, Morgan.

17:31.984 --> 17:35.354
That girl shouldn't have
never said anything to me.

17:35.421 --> 17:38.257
Well, at the end of
the day you [bleep] my party up.

17:38.323 --> 17:38.924
I feel like...

17:38.991 --> 17:39.958
I [bleep] Ray's party up...

17:40.025 --> 17:41.760
It was my party
because I threw it.

17:41.827 --> 17:42.895
Because that bitch
came to my face.

17:42.961 --> 17:44.029
I put [bleep] together,
he shows up.

17:44.096 --> 17:44.696
So what?

17:44.763 --> 17:45.864
So it's my party.

17:45.931 --> 17:47.232
So I was suppose to let her
come in my face like that?

17:47.299 --> 17:49.535
You know me, and you should
have told her, if you go in her

17:49.601 --> 17:52.971
face like that then
she's gonna turn up.

17:53.038 --> 17:54.606
It's crazy that Morgan wants
to blame me for everything that

17:54.673 --> 17:57.910
happened at the RayJ.com party
when it was this trick ass bitch

17:57.976 --> 18:02.381
princess who came up in my
face getting in my business.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.716
I love Morgan, but I am not
about to take the downfall

18:04.783 --> 18:06.552
for some bitch.

18:06.618 --> 18:09.154
We can move on from
this and be amicable,

18:09.221 --> 18:11.590
or we can just whatever.

18:11.657 --> 18:14.126
At the end of the day, you know
how I feel when it comes to

18:14.193 --> 18:16.495
the whole violent thing.

18:16.562 --> 18:18.964
How could you turn around
and try and physically get

18:19.031 --> 18:19.932
physical with me?

18:19.998 --> 18:21.200
Did I put my hands on you?

18:21.266 --> 18:23.368
You kept, yes you kept grabbing
me and doing all this [bleep],

18:23.435 --> 18:24.570
and I kept
getting you off of me.

18:24.636 --> 18:27.072
But don't act like it
wasn't about to go there.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.674
Don't act like you were
not trying to go there.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.642
It wasn't gonna
go there, Morgan.

18:30.709 --> 18:31.777
Just because I don't drink,
I'm always sober, so I know

18:31.844 --> 18:32.878
what I'm talking about.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.513
That's what you need to stop.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.380
You know, like when you
drink, you're a completely

18:35.447 --> 18:37.416
different person.

18:37.816 --> 18:40.252
I really do have love for
Teairra, but Teairra's not the

18:40.319 --> 18:41.854
{\an5}same person when she drinks.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.490
{\an5}She's always ready to turn up
and put hands on people the

18:44.556 --> 18:46.625
second that she's intoxicated.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.495
She's hit Ray before, she's
gotten into it with me and tried

18:49.561 --> 18:51.096
to put her hands on me before.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.832
And now she has her
eyes set on Princess.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.834
I don't know how I
can help any more.

18:55.901 --> 18:58.904
And as sad as it is, maybe I
should just keep my distance.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.573
You've been there with me
through a lot of situations,

19:01.640 --> 19:03.108
Morgan, and you know that.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.443
Right.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.578
And if a bitch came in here
right now and said something

19:06.645 --> 19:09.348
to you, I would knock
her the [bleep] out.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.216
And I still, to this
day, have your back.

19:11.283 --> 19:12.684
I don't give a [bleep]
how you feel about me.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.486
If you out in the club and
I see a bitch jump on you,

19:14.553 --> 19:15.854
I'm a jump in, best believe it.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.289
And absolutely, vice versa.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.090
Please believe that.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.124
You are loyal.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.859
And you're loyal to
a fault sometimes.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.928
I agree with that.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.396
I'm loyal to the wrong
people a lot of times.

19:24.463 --> 19:25.330
A lot of times.

19:25.397 --> 19:26.331
I know.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.600
So me and you, we
could never get past this.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.935
I'm not saying that
we can't Teairra.

19:30.002 --> 19:30.869
Okay, cool.

19:30.936 --> 19:31.837
Well then, I don't
care how we feel about

19:31.904 --> 19:34.640
each other right now,
I have love for you.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.241
I always have.

19:36.308 --> 19:43.081
If you don't wanna accept that
and move on, then that's fine.

19:44.383 --> 19:46.318
{\an8}I just don't think that
he respects you enough.

19:46.385 --> 19:47.319
{\an8}He's so damn cute though.

19:47.386 --> 19:48.387
{\an8}[bleep] that cute [bleep].

19:48.453 --> 19:49.421
{\an8}It's all over the internet.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.623
{\an8}I haven't seen anything.

19:52.024 --> 19:58.830
{\an5}♪♪

20:07.072 --> 20:09.741
I am Masika Kalysha, and I'm
the girl in high school that you

20:09.808 --> 20:12.377
{\an5}wanted to be besties with but
then you talked really bad about

20:12.444 --> 20:14.313
her behind her back.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.014
You may know me
as a video vixen.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.517
I have starred in countless
music videos with so many

20:18.584 --> 20:22.588
artists like Rico Love, Tiga,
Flo Rida, Lenny Kravitz,

20:22.654 --> 20:24.623
and so many more.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.458
You don't come to Hollywood
to make it, you come to

20:26.525 --> 20:28.360
Hollywood to be a star.

20:28.427 --> 20:29.861
And I came here to be a star.

20:29.928 --> 20:33.765
I wanna be taken serious as
a legitimate actor and singer.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.500
I'm not just the cute girl that
walked in the room and

20:35.567 --> 20:37.069
got the token role.

20:37.135 --> 20:39.571
Hello.

20:39.638 --> 20:40.339
For me?

20:40.405 --> 20:41.740
Thank you.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.709
Mally Mall's one of the biggest
up and coming producers in the

20:43.775 --> 20:47.179
game, and he's connected to
Dre, Chris Brown, Tiga, French

20:47.245 --> 20:50.182
Montana, basically anybody
that you would wanna know.

20:50.248 --> 20:52.084
Mally spends most of his time in
Las Vegas, where he lives in

20:52.150 --> 20:54.353
a ridiculous mansion.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.687
We've been dating for a little
while now, and these

20:55.754 --> 20:57.322
hos are jealous of me.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.224
Interesting how we met,
um, he got my number

20:59.291 --> 21:01.259
from Justin Beiber.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.528
Don't really know
how to explain that.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.231
And then we just had a
conversation and he was like,

21:06.298 --> 21:07.399
I'm looking for a female lead in
my next video and I

21:07.466 --> 21:09.101
think you'd be perfect.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.970
And just like that, we started
hooking up, and he started

21:12.037 --> 21:14.272
flying me in and out of Vegas.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.407
Things are moving really fast
with me and Mally,

21:15.474 --> 21:17.042
faster than I'm used to.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.144
And he just recently asked
me to help find him a place

21:19.211 --> 21:20.445
here in L.A.

21:20.512 --> 21:22.481
So I hope this means we can
spend more time together,

21:22.547 --> 21:24.883
'cause I really do miss him.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.153
I spent all week searching
for places, and I found you

21:28.220 --> 21:30.789
a place as promised.

21:30.856 --> 21:34.159
Got you the key, did
not make a spare yet.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.094
I really appreciate that.

21:36.161 --> 21:37.963
I can start being in L.A more.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.197
I would like that.

21:39.264 --> 21:41.800
{\an5}And I might let you leave a
couple little items at my house.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.335
{\an5}I just got a really cute pair
of shoes, they'll look great

21:43.402 --> 21:44.836
in your closet.

21:44.903 --> 21:47.639
And I'm with it.

21:47.706 --> 21:49.141
He's getting jealous, look.

21:49.207 --> 21:50.409
See, big time.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.877
I think that space is for me.

21:51.943 --> 21:53.145
Nice socks, where
did you find these?

21:53.211 --> 21:54.146
In your closet.

21:54.212 --> 21:55.113
[laughs]

21:55.180 --> 21:56.615
Somebody's been
sneaking in my closet, huh?

21:56.682 --> 21:58.250
Um, I have a
collection of your shirts now.

21:58.316 --> 21:59.584
All right.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.153
I walk around looking like you.

22:01.219 --> 22:02.054
I see how you work.

22:02.120 --> 22:02.854
Uh huh.

22:02.921 --> 22:04.356
Take some instagram selfies.

22:04.423 --> 22:05.724
I got you, don't flip.

22:05.791 --> 22:06.892
[laughter]

22:06.958 --> 22:08.160
I could get used to this.

22:08.226 --> 22:09.494
We're sharing keys, different
cities, I'm even wearing

22:09.561 --> 22:11.163
some of his clothes.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.031
But he does have a reputation.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.033
He's known to be a playboy.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.702
I don't know, I need to
know if this is for real.

22:16.768 --> 22:17.903
Like is he serious?

22:17.969 --> 22:21.406
Because I don't wanna be
set up to get let down.

22:21.473 --> 22:24.976
But how would you feel about,
I don't know, maybe making

22:25.043 --> 22:27.279
it a little more official?

22:27.345 --> 22:28.914
I definitely see
that between us.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.816
I just want it to
happen organically.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.617
You know, I just got out of a
real serious relationship,

22:32.684 --> 22:34.619
so I don't wanna like,
you know, front.

22:34.686 --> 22:35.754
You know what I mean?

22:35.821 --> 22:37.022
Like, I like you, I like
everything, but I think the more

22:37.089 --> 22:39.124
I feel free, the more I
feel like I wanna be committed

22:39.191 --> 22:40.358
because I have that option.

22:40.425 --> 22:41.893
I like it.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.195
But you know, at the end of
the day, you're stuck with me,

22:43.261 --> 22:44.196
regardless.

22:44.262 --> 22:45.897
So...

22:45.964 --> 22:55.941
{\an5}♪♪

22:56.007 --> 23:03.048
{\an5}♪♪

23:05.984 --> 23:10.055
[cheering and applause]

23:10.122 --> 23:10.622
What up TiTi?

23:10.689 --> 23:11.056
What up though?

23:11.123 --> 23:12.324
Hey boo.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.592
{\an5}I haven't seen Haze since all
the drama at the RayJ.com party

23:13.658 --> 23:16.094
{\an5}and as pissed off as I am with
Morgan and Ray, I have to give

23:16.161 --> 23:18.930
it to Haze, she's had my back,
she's been my rock through this

23:18.997 --> 23:20.499
whole situation.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.801
And she was right
there, turning up with me.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.369
I gotta respect that.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.338
I just wanted to apologize,
first of all, for putting you

23:26.404 --> 23:28.106
in that position.

23:28.173 --> 23:29.641
To have to turn up on somebody.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.010
But first of all, you ain't
gotta apologize cause at the end

23:32.077 --> 23:33.345
of the day, like we're sisters.

23:33.411 --> 23:34.146
You know what I'm sayin?

23:34.212 --> 23:35.113
Yeah.

23:35.180 --> 23:36.548
We need to put these
[bleep] in their place.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.216
Honey, I've been
feeling like that.

23:38.283 --> 23:40.051
Well I think the first step,
one, is you got this little

23:40.118 --> 23:42.954
Ray J on your titty
at the moment.

23:43.021 --> 23:43.989
You know, maybe it's
about time to go ahead and

23:44.055 --> 23:45.190
get covered on up.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.525
When Ray and I were
together I thought we would

23:46.591 --> 23:48.260
be together forever.

23:48.326 --> 23:50.529
So, I got his name tattooed
on my body, and obviously

23:50.595 --> 23:52.631
that wasn't a good idea.

23:52.697 --> 23:55.200
So maybe Haze is right, it's
time to get him x-ed out of

23:55.267 --> 23:58.870
my life and off of my body.

23:58.937 --> 23:59.905
So I'm gonna keep it real
cute, and I'm gonna get

23:59.971 --> 24:01.373
this shit up off of me.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.675
So we gonna have a tattoo party.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.812
{\an5}So TiTi wants to have a
tattoo party and I'm down.

24:06.878 --> 24:10.215
{\an5}Finally she's gonna go ahead
and put Ray J in her past.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.550
I mean, I don't know how
she's dealt with that situation

24:11.616 --> 24:13.485
for so long.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.220
But honestly, who am I to talk?

24:15.287 --> 24:17.656
We know how Berg pulls
on my heart strings.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.825
Girl, okay so I went to the
studio, you know what I'm sayin,

24:19.891 --> 24:24.062
to meet up with Youngin, Berg.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.064
You went back to him again?

24:26.131 --> 24:28.600
You know, he came back around,
and we had, you know,

24:28.667 --> 24:29.901
a good little moment or two.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.036
You know what I'm sayin?

24:31.102 --> 24:32.504
I just don't think that
he respects you enough.

24:32.571 --> 24:34.139
He's so damn cute though.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.941
[bleep] that cute [bleep].

24:36.007 --> 24:39.244
If Berg cared about Haze on
that level, he would treat her

24:39.311 --> 24:41.379
in another manner.

24:41.446 --> 24:44.583
So as much as it may hurt
her, she needs to hear that.

24:44.649 --> 24:48.086
She needs to know that
he's just not that into you.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.589
Like seriously, on
some real [bleep] him.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.724
'Cause he don't give a [bleep]
about you and I refuse to

24:52.791 --> 24:57.963
sit here and let you think that
it's anything other than that.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.498
I'm a little confused why
Teairra has so much to say

25:00.565 --> 25:02.667
about my relationship
when she's still rockin' a

25:02.734 --> 25:06.204
tattoo of a dude that she hasn't
even spoken to in eight months.

25:06.271 --> 25:08.907
At the end of the day, it's my
relationship with Berg and

25:08.974 --> 25:10.809
I gotta handle things my way.

25:10.876 --> 25:13.712
He knows me, like
we know each other.

25:13.778 --> 25:15.046
Like, I can't explain, this
is not something that

25:15.113 --> 25:16.314
happened over night.

25:16.381 --> 25:18.817
I get the history, but when he's
trying to pursue someone else,

25:18.884 --> 25:20.285
he doesn't give a [bleep].

25:20.352 --> 25:22.387
That's what you gotta keep in yo
head and don't let him pull the

25:22.454 --> 25:26.224
wool over your eyes and
don't let him [bleep] you over.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.159
{\an5}♪♪

25:28.226 --> 25:31.396
Power 106, your girl Yesi Ortiz
and I am so excited L.A because

25:31.463 --> 25:35.533
this is my first show that I am
kicking off, called "The Real."

25:35.600 --> 25:38.270
{\an5}My name is Yesi Ortiz and I'm
the assistant music director and

25:38.336 --> 25:41.239
radio talent here on Power 106.

25:41.306 --> 25:45.577
I'm dishing the real T on what's
what and who's who in Hollywood.

25:45.644 --> 25:48.980
I'm excited cause my friend
Morgan, who is also known in

25:49.047 --> 25:51.516
the industry as Ray
J's assistant, and you

25:51.583 --> 25:52.817
brought along
another friend.

25:52.884 --> 25:53.652
Yes.

25:53.718 --> 25:54.753
{\an5}Miss Nia Riley.

25:54.819 --> 25:55.820
Hello.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.889
So let's kick things off, man.

25:57.956 --> 25:58.657
Nia, your dad, Teddy Riley,
first of all is a legend in

25:58.723 --> 25:59.925
the game.

25:59.991 --> 26:01.426
Yes, he's like my best friend.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.128
You also date Soulja Boy.

26:03.194 --> 26:04.062
Yes, I do.

26:04.129 --> 26:05.230
So he's currently
your boyfriend?

26:05.297 --> 26:06.398
He is my boyfriend.

26:06.464 --> 26:07.632
How long have you
guys been dating?

26:07.699 --> 26:11.870
Oh God, we started
dating when he was 16.

26:11.937 --> 26:14.072
And it has been 8 years and
there's been a lot of back

26:14.139 --> 26:15.707
and forth and...

26:15.774 --> 26:18.376
That's gotta be when, the
moments when you guys had a

26:18.443 --> 26:23.848
break, that that's when he would
be in his moments of man

26:23.915 --> 26:26.351
whorish ways.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.319
Oh yeah.

26:27.385 --> 26:28.586
And how did you handle that?

26:28.653 --> 26:31.389
Because there's a girl right now
listening at home, thinking oh

26:31.456 --> 26:32.924
my God, I wanna marry Drake.

26:32.991 --> 26:33.625
Run.

26:33.692 --> 26:34.359
Oh my God.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.827
Don't do it.

26:35.894 --> 26:38.229
Well I'm looking at it from a
different point of view because

26:38.296 --> 26:42.634
I'm the girl who works for these
guys, and I'm finagling these

26:42.701 --> 26:43.668
guys to cheat sometimes.

26:43.735 --> 26:44.502
You're bringing females around.

26:44.569 --> 26:46.137
I'm bringing
females to these guys.

26:46.204 --> 26:49.174
We eventually find out about it,
because social media is crazy.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.977
You know, I stopped
going to search for things.

26:52.043 --> 26:55.280
I just, I wanna be happy, so
I'm not gonna go looking for it.

26:55.347 --> 27:00.285
And that's, you know to bring up
my point about what I saw on the

27:00.352 --> 27:05.991
internet in regards
to Soulja and Corrine.

27:06.057 --> 27:08.026
Listen, I'm just
here doing my job.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.462
Rumor has it that Soulja Boy
and Corrine Steffens had

27:10.528 --> 27:12.530
a little thing a while back.

27:12.597 --> 27:15.734
And just recently she's been
posting pictures of her and him

27:15.800 --> 27:17.235
boo'd up together.

27:17.302 --> 27:21.106
I mean, Nia's here in the
studio today, so I gotta ask.

27:21.172 --> 27:23.174
You can say whatever you wanna
say, you can talk about it

27:23.241 --> 27:23.975
if you wanna talk about it.

27:24.042 --> 27:24.776
Wait, are you confused?

27:24.843 --> 27:26.177
I'm just a little confused.

27:26.244 --> 27:27.979
She's confused and doesn't
know what you're talking about.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.248
The Intstagram photos.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.218
It sounds like these photos
she's talking about are recent.

27:33.284 --> 27:34.586
{\an5}And if that's the case, me
and Dre are gonna have

27:34.652 --> 27:36.321
a serious problem.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.923
And I'm about done
with this interview.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.659
Well I hate to be the one that
saddens you, 'cause I thought

27:41.726 --> 27:43.762
that you had seen some photos.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.096
I haven't seen anything.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.631
I mean, it's all
over the internet.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.566
You should show her the picture
'cause she hasn't seen it,

27:48.633 --> 27:50.268
like that's weird.

27:50.335 --> 27:56.107
Um, let's see here.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.109
I feel really bad for Nia.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.878
Ain't nothing worse
than getting ambushed.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.846
I mean, these photos have been
floating around on the internet

28:01.913 --> 28:04.949
for a while now, so it's kind of
hard to believe that she didn't

28:05.016 --> 28:06.851
know about it, but she
definitely does look

28:06.918 --> 28:08.353
surprised right now.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.254
I guess what happens now?

28:09.320 --> 28:11.456
Like, what do you plan on doing?

28:11.523 --> 28:12.524
Like...

28:12.590 --> 28:15.260
That's something I have
to deal with face to face.

28:15.326 --> 28:16.094
Yeah.

28:16.161 --> 28:17.395
Absolutely.

28:17.462 --> 28:20.598
Because he can't
get away from that.

28:20.665 --> 28:21.966
Like...

28:22.033 --> 28:26.237
Like that's, that
like is embarrassing.

28:26.304 --> 28:27.705
{\an8}Well I don't like people who
come between someone

28:27.772 --> 28:29.074
{\an8}and their man.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.776
{\an8}I will make it very clear to
her, know your mother [bleep]

28:31.843 --> 28:33.645
{\an8}place or I will let you know.

28:33.711 --> 28:36.047
{\an8}I mean she's never gonna
take my man from me, period.

28:36.114 --> 28:37.582
{\an8}I don't need to assume [bleep].

28:37.649 --> 28:41.352
{\an8}Because if I assumed, then I'd
be assuming my way to the house

28:41.419 --> 28:43.755
{\an8}every day to hand you an ass
whoopin' and it would

28:43.822 --> 28:49.094
{\an8}just be that.

28:56.267 --> 28:57.235
Hey, Morgan.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.636
Hey, baby.

28:58.703 --> 29:00.672
{\an5}I know Mally and I are suppose
to be broken up right now,

29:00.738 --> 29:02.207
{\an5}but we've taken a break before.

29:02.273 --> 29:03.475
{\an5}That doesn't mean anything.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.009
My friends have been calling me
and been telling me that he's

29:05.076 --> 29:07.412
messing around with
some chick named Masika.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.948
She's been posting photos
being boo'd up with my man.

29:10.014 --> 29:12.450
I reached out to my friend
Morgan and I wanted to see her

29:12.517 --> 29:14.919
take on the situation
since she knows the girl.

29:14.986 --> 29:18.056
I need to get my facts straight
before I check Mally himself.

29:18.123 --> 29:20.058
You know I've been
single lately, right?

29:20.125 --> 29:24.429
You know, I didn't really
know what was going on, but I...

29:24.496 --> 29:27.031
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard
a little bit of, you know,

29:27.098 --> 29:28.600
some social media hit.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.034
I'm sure you've saw
what was going on.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.436
Yeah, with Masika?

29:31.503 --> 29:32.504
Yeah, whatever her name is.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.139
Well I mean, what's the issue?

29:34.205 --> 29:35.039
What's the situation with them?

29:35.106 --> 29:36.241
I mean, I don't know.

29:36.307 --> 29:38.076
We broke up over some little
bull [bleep], like you know,

29:38.143 --> 29:39.777
he didn't have time, he
was always in the studio,

29:39.844 --> 29:41.112
you know how it is.

29:41.179 --> 29:43.515
And then, you know, like
a week later or so, I see

29:43.581 --> 29:45.016
pictures of her in his bed.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.685
And I'm just kind of like, my
girls are hitting me, like Nikki

29:47.752 --> 29:48.853
what the hell is going on?

29:48.920 --> 29:50.989
I did see you post
something around that time,

29:51.055 --> 29:52.157
and I was like oh [bleep].

29:52.223 --> 29:53.324
[bleep] about to get real.

29:53.391 --> 29:53.892
Yeah, you know, I don't like
people who come in between

29:53.958 --> 29:55.493
someone and their man.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.695
And I feel like she
knows exactly who I am.

29:57.762 --> 30:00.899
Our relationship was very public
and I felt like her pictures all

30:00.965 --> 30:03.134
over him, it's kind of like, I
felt like she was kind of like

30:03.201 --> 30:05.470
trying to antagonize
me in some type of way.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.973
Not only did Masika not waste
any time jumping in my man's bed

30:09.040 --> 30:12.277
a few days after we broke up,
but she went and posted photos

30:12.343 --> 30:14.379
all over the internet and made
sure I was gonna be

30:14.445 --> 30:16.047
able to see it.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.149
So not only did she disrespect
me, but she tried to humiliate

30:18.216 --> 30:21.352
me, and I don't
respond well to that.

30:21.419 --> 30:24.155
Obviously, he was telling her
something to make her feel

30:24.222 --> 30:25.423
like that was her man.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.592
Maybe she doesn't understand the
severity of our relationship.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.961
He gave me this ring, we were
looking for a place together,

30:30.028 --> 30:31.196
you know doing all
that extra stuff.

30:31.262 --> 30:33.064
She'll never be his woman.

30:33.131 --> 30:34.265
Here we go again.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.768
{\an5}I always find myself in
the middle of some drama.

30:36.834 --> 30:38.770
{\an5}Nikki's my girl,
Masika's my girl,

30:38.836 --> 30:40.705
they're both beautiful girls.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.474
Mally, maybe not so much.

30:43.541 --> 30:44.542
I don't understand why these
two girls are going at each

30:44.609 --> 30:46.311
others heads over him.

30:46.377 --> 30:48.846
I will make it very clear to
her, know your mother [bleep]

30:48.913 --> 30:51.182
place or I will let you know.

30:51.249 --> 30:52.951
I mean she's never
gonna take my man from me.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.253
Period.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.189
{\an5}♪♪

30:58.256 --> 31:00.124
Every since my son Cameron told
me about Drew's new girlfriend,

31:00.191 --> 31:03.795
I can't help but to
feel some type of way.

31:03.861 --> 31:06.998
{\an5}And I feel like it's my job to
take my mole whacker and knock

31:07.065 --> 31:09.367
that ho right back into her
place and let her know exactly

31:09.434 --> 31:10.935
how I feel.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.504
{\an5}Bottom line, at the end of the
day, Amanda needs to know no

31:13.571 --> 31:16.107
stepping on my toes 'cause momma
bear doesn't play when it

31:16.174 --> 31:17.542
comes to her cub.

31:17.609 --> 31:20.411
First I want you to know
that I'm going to give you,

31:20.478 --> 31:23.147
{\an5}as a woman, the
benefit of the doubt.

31:23.214 --> 31:27.585
I wanted to rip your face off,
but because I'm trying to get

31:27.652 --> 31:30.288
to a space that's amicable
with you, I'm not going to.

31:30.355 --> 31:31.689
I don't dislike you.

31:31.756 --> 31:32.957
We don't know each other
to dislike each other.

31:33.024 --> 31:37.095
What I didn't appreciate was,
if you're picking my son up from

31:37.161 --> 31:39.697
school, and you're watching
my son, and you're cooking his

31:39.764 --> 31:42.767
meals, and you're this and that,
the fact that you're comfortable

31:42.834 --> 31:45.069
with that, never having met
me, never having had a

31:45.136 --> 31:47.872
conversation with me...

31:47.939 --> 31:50.074
The fact that you're comfortable
with that, never having met me,

31:50.141 --> 31:51.075
is a little off.

31:51.142 --> 31:52.977
I'm not comfortable with it.

31:53.044 --> 31:54.312
You'll go weeks
without seeing Cameron.

31:54.379 --> 31:55.947
How is that okay?

31:56.014 --> 31:57.415
You don't think I call to
find out where the [bleep]

31:57.482 --> 31:58.516
my son is?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.518
You don't think I wanna
know where he lays his head?

32:00.585 --> 32:01.986
You don't think I wanna know
what bitches are in and

32:02.053 --> 32:03.254
out of his life?

32:03.321 --> 32:05.223
You're the fourth
since he's been born.

32:05.290 --> 32:08.192
So of course I wanna know, but
if somebody refuses to answer

32:08.259 --> 32:11.396
the phone and that's the only
line of communication I have,

32:11.462 --> 32:14.132
I'm sort of at his mercy.

32:14.198 --> 32:19.804
I am absolutely blown to the
floor that Amanda would ever

32:19.871 --> 32:23.708
fix her lips to tell me
how to be a fit mother.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.143
Me and Drew have been
together for two years and I'm

32:25.209 --> 32:27.412
in Cameron's life
whether you know it or not.

32:27.478 --> 32:30.281
I see that Drew has
him 99% of the time.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.350
I don't give a fuck if
you're together, how long

32:32.417 --> 32:33.284
you've been together...

32:33.351 --> 32:34.819
You're just a little angry.

32:34.886 --> 32:37.322
I'm not angry, what I want you
to do is worry about getting

32:37.388 --> 32:39.223
[bleep] and let me
worry about my child.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.894
If you're with my son every day,
then every day you need to call

32:42.960 --> 32:45.163
me and tell me what's going on.

32:45.229 --> 32:46.431
[arguing]

32:46.497 --> 32:49.000
I don't need to assume [bleep],
because if I assumed, then I'd

32:49.067 --> 32:52.403
be assuming my way to the house
every day to hand you an ass

32:52.470 --> 32:54.405
whoopin' and it
would just be that.

32:54.472 --> 32:57.175
If you think you're
gonna be here forever...

32:57.241 --> 32:59.177
I am gonna be here forever.

32:59.243 --> 33:02.447
You guys go ahead and
hold on to that hope.

33:02.513 --> 33:04.682
Getting your dream card
and until that day...

33:04.749 --> 33:06.317
[arguing]

33:06.384 --> 33:10.688
Sail off into the sunset and
paddle back to whatever little

33:10.755 --> 33:13.124
country it is
that you came from.

33:13.191 --> 33:14.992
You're insane.

33:15.059 --> 33:17.028
{\an5}You acting like it was
photo shopped, or like...

33:17.095 --> 33:18.229
{\an5}So why you pushing my hand?

33:18.296 --> 33:19.564
{\an5}Well I don't like
your hand touching me.

33:19.630 --> 33:20.832
{\an5}Don't push my hand like that.

33:20.898 --> 33:28.906
{\an5}At the end of the day Dog,
she got something comin'.

33:33.978 --> 33:37.081
♪ I be trappin' trappin,
packin rubbin and ♪

33:37.148 --> 33:40.017

33:47.692 --> 33:49.193
I'm confused and
embarrassed after Yesi

33:49.260 --> 33:51.662
dropped that bomb on me
at the radio station.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.197
I wanna here what Dre has
to say before I start

33:53.264 --> 33:56.300
jumping to conclusions.

34:02.607 --> 34:03.975
We need to talk.

34:06.577 --> 34:09.647
Nia just texted me a
photo of me and my home girl.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.116
{\an5}I already know what this
is, you dig what I'm sayin?

34:12.183 --> 34:13.784
I've done been down
this road before.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.286
It's about to get ugly.

34:16.954 --> 34:18.156
Did you get the
picture I sent you?

34:18.222 --> 34:20.958
Yeah I got the picture.

34:21.025 --> 34:22.560
So, what do you
have to say about it?

34:22.627 --> 34:24.962
You didn't say anything.

34:25.029 --> 34:26.831
Well, let's talk about it.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.533
I was [bleep] with her.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.333
I don't [bleep]
with her no more.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.270
We've been friends for a long
time and I see her from

34:32.335 --> 34:33.471
time to time.

34:33.538 --> 34:36.274
She takes selfies and
put it up on the internet.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.609
But Nia ain't got
nothing to worry about.

34:38.676 --> 34:40.578
Nothing happened and
everything all good.

34:40.645 --> 34:41.712
You know what I'm sayin?

34:41.779 --> 34:43.815
You acting like I'm dating
her or she my girlfriend.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.183
That's what it looked like.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.484
That's exactly
what it looked like.

34:46.551 --> 34:47.618
How is that what it looked like?

34:47.685 --> 34:48.553
I didn't put her
on my Instagram.

34:48.619 --> 34:49.554
It doesn't matter.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.255
I still saw it,
you still did it.

34:51.322 --> 34:52.723
Y'all were in the car together,
there was nobody

34:52.790 --> 34:53.958
else in the car...

34:54.025 --> 34:55.693
We was going to
have a conversation.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.361
Y'all could have did
that on the sidewalk.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.397
Why y'all in the car
riding around together?

34:59.464 --> 35:00.097
Wherever.

35:00.164 --> 35:01.799
I don't even remember.

35:01.866 --> 35:02.934
We went somewhere and sat
down and had a conversation

35:03.000 --> 35:04.035
in Hollywood.

35:04.101 --> 35:05.236
You know how that looks?

35:05.303 --> 35:07.238
Do you care about
how I feel about that?

35:07.305 --> 35:09.707
But you gotta understand,
there's gonna be media,

35:09.774 --> 35:10.675
propaganda.

35:10.741 --> 35:11.709
But it came straight from her.

35:11.776 --> 35:12.543
But you gotta understand.

35:12.610 --> 35:13.845
And it was you in the picture.

35:13.911 --> 35:14.846
You got [bleep]...

35:14.912 --> 35:16.814
You acting like it was
photoshopped or like....

35:16.881 --> 35:17.648
So why you pushing my hand?

35:17.715 --> 35:18.649
You were there.

35:18.716 --> 35:20.318
'Cause I don't want you
to touch me right now.

35:20.384 --> 35:21.018
Don't push my hand.

35:21.085 --> 35:22.153
Don't push my hand like that.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.054
Don't do that no more.

35:23.120 --> 35:23.821
All right.

35:23.888 --> 35:24.622
Ever.

35:24.689 --> 35:25.923
I will do it again
if you tried it.

35:25.990 --> 35:27.458
I'm done with this.

35:27.525 --> 35:28.659
Rehearsal man, let's get it.

35:28.726 --> 35:30.194
I've got to do my show.

35:30.261 --> 35:32.196
Open this door up.

35:32.930 --> 35:41.005
{\an5}♪♪

35:41.072 --> 35:42.306
{\an5}You know what?

35:42.373 --> 35:43.708
{\an5}I've been amp'd up ever
since Teairra Marie came to

35:43.774 --> 35:46.744
{\an5}my RayJ.com party
and turned [bleep] up.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.513
What's up man, there he is.

35:48.579 --> 35:49.881
What's going on?

35:49.947 --> 35:51.749
I reached out to my boy Sincere
just to talk to him and just

35:51.816 --> 35:53.618
kind of air out my problems.

35:53.684 --> 35:54.986
What's happening?

35:55.052 --> 35:56.254
Same thing man.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.154
[bleep].

35:57.221 --> 35:58.122
{\an5}Yo, what the [bleep]
happened at the...

35:58.189 --> 35:59.190
{\an5}Listen man.

35:59.257 --> 36:00.424
Your release [bleep] man.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.393
First off, I invited
Teairra to the party.

36:02.460 --> 36:03.528
Yeah.

36:03.594 --> 36:05.863
And I'm thinking everything's
going to be cool and she

36:05.930 --> 36:09.567
immediately tell me I owe
her a check for some [bleep]

36:09.634 --> 36:11.168
about me losing her bag.

36:11.235 --> 36:13.070
So my girl hear about it,
she come over like what?

36:13.137 --> 36:14.505
Is this the check
your looking for?

36:14.572 --> 36:16.073
Whatever she saw, start
showing her pictures.

36:16.140 --> 36:17.108
What she show her?

36:17.174 --> 36:18.576
She showed her some
[bleep] up [bleep]

36:18.643 --> 36:20.311
that Teairra had in her bag.

36:20.378 --> 36:22.313
And Teairra threw a glass
on her and then went crazy.

36:22.380 --> 36:23.180
Awe man.

36:23.247 --> 36:24.315
So what, it just
ended like that?

36:24.382 --> 36:25.583
It was just a bunch of chaos?

36:25.650 --> 36:31.489
No, there was a bunch of chaos
and she tried to attack my girl.

36:31.556 --> 36:33.157
Then all my home
girls got involved.

36:33.224 --> 36:34.825
All her home girls got involved.

36:34.892 --> 36:37.228
Man, I had some investors there.

36:37.295 --> 36:40.831
I was just really embarrassed.

36:40.898 --> 36:42.433
It was disrespectful.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.901
Pretty face like hers, she
shouldn't be out here doing

36:43.968 --> 36:45.269
all that turned up [bleep].

36:45.336 --> 36:48.506
You come to my party, and be
on some disrespectful [bleep]

36:48.573 --> 36:51.509
like that and think
we gonna let it ride?

36:51.576 --> 36:52.577
All right.

36:52.643 --> 36:53.978
I feel like she's
embarrassed the [bleep]

36:54.045 --> 36:57.381
out of me, she's cost us a lot
of money, and a lot of headache.

36:57.448 --> 37:00.217
I'm just, I'm losing sleep
for it, until I feel like I do

37:00.284 --> 37:02.820
something about it.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.756
I don't know man, I don't wanna
be hearing all that [bleep] man.

37:05.823 --> 37:06.791
You know?

37:06.857 --> 37:08.593
At the end of the day Dog,
I just feel like she

37:08.659 --> 37:11.095
got something coming.

37:12.296 --> 37:13.731
{\an8}What bitch, don't
come at me like that.

37:13.798 --> 37:15.499
{\an8}I don't give a shit who you
got up in this mother [bleep].

37:15.566 --> 37:17.168
{\an8}You want it like that though?

37:17.234 --> 37:24.275
{\an8}[arguing]

37:28.779 --> 37:31.115
So after all the stress, drama,
and heart break, I'm finally

37:31.182 --> 37:33.918
ready to put Ray J behind me.

37:33.985 --> 37:36.454
So I invited Haze, her
girlfriend Masika, and a couple

37:36.520 --> 37:38.956
of my other friends to witness
me get Ray's name removed

37:39.023 --> 37:40.958
from under my breast.

37:41.525 --> 37:42.960
Okay.

37:43.027 --> 37:44.328
Wait, wait.

37:44.395 --> 37:47.531
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!

37:48.032 --> 37:49.934
I'm scared.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.036
{\an5}♪♪

37:52.103 --> 37:53.304
Ahh!

37:53.371 --> 37:55.606
I don't know why I
did this to myself.

37:56.507 --> 37:58.442
{\an5}♪♪

37:58.509 --> 38:01.545
All right, she's done.

38:01.612 --> 38:02.980
[cheering]

38:03.047 --> 38:15.259
{\an5}♪♪

38:15.326 --> 38:19.797
This [bleep] hurts
like crazy, but it's not

38:19.864 --> 38:22.533
nearly as painful as
being left destitute and in

38:22.600 --> 38:24.435
the cold by the man you love.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.270
Now, I feel like a new me.

38:26.337 --> 38:28.973
Ray J's in the past, time to
celebrate me, 'cause I've been

38:29.040 --> 38:31.409
living for somebody
else for way too long.

38:31.475 --> 38:35.813
{\an5}So she's getting her closure,
what's going on with you?

38:35.880 --> 38:38.082
Berg is like a child too, and
that's why he can't control his

38:38.149 --> 38:41.852
{\an5}emotions or actually
dedicate himself to one person.

38:41.919 --> 38:43.554
All I really want from him,
honestly at the end of the day

38:43.621 --> 38:45.356
is to see who's in your corner.

38:45.423 --> 38:46.791
[bleep] all of them.

38:46.857 --> 38:48.325
This is about my closure.

38:48.392 --> 38:49.627
I just got a tattoo.

38:49.694 --> 38:50.628
Yes you did.

38:50.695 --> 38:52.329
I closed my whole situation.

38:52.396 --> 38:53.698
You know what?

38:53.764 --> 38:55.533
You and Berg, it's cute,
but y'all ain't even got

38:55.599 --> 38:56.967
enough situation.

38:57.034 --> 38:58.636
You ain't got his
name tattooed on you.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.404
'Cause I would
never do that though.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.273
I would never get no
[bleep] tattooed on me.

39:03.441 --> 39:05.943
I know Hazel didn't just try
to come for me and my tattoo.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.078
What?

39:07.144 --> 39:09.480
You mad that I said your
relationship with Berg is fake?

39:09.547 --> 39:11.749
My relationship with Ray and her
non-existent relationship with

39:11.816 --> 39:14.351
Berg does not even compare.

39:14.418 --> 39:15.286
Okay, then that's fine.

39:15.352 --> 39:16.387
So can we...

39:16.454 --> 39:17.788
Don't come at me like that.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.090
I'm not.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.759
I'm just sayin, I wouldn't
get his name tattooed on me,

39:21.826 --> 39:22.860
so please....

39:22.927 --> 39:25.796
And that's okay, you
won't ever got to bitch.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.365
Don't ever try to judge me about
some [bleep] that I just did.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.101
You just did.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.335
Bitch, don't come
at me like that.

39:31.402 --> 39:33.537
I don't give a fuck who you
got up in this mother [bleep].

39:33.804 --> 39:34.972
You want it like that, though?

39:35.039 --> 39:35.840
Hold on.

39:35.906 --> 39:41.045
[arguing]

39:41.378 --> 39:42.980
Oh really?

39:43.047 --> 39:44.915
Happy?

39:52.590 --> 39:55.192
{\an8}Like whatever you
want, [bleep] with B.V.

39:55.259 --> 39:58.229
{\an8}Whatever you got in the [bleep]
bag, I got it, it's right there.

39:58.295 --> 39:59.096
{\an8}I'm trippin.

39:59.163 --> 40:00.765
{\an8}Hold up, hold up, hold up.

40:00.831 --> 40:02.767
{\an8}Get Teairra!

40:02.833 --> 40:03.567
{\an8}Definitely went too far.

40:03.634 --> 40:05.603
{\an8}I draw the line right here.

40:05.669 --> 40:08.072
{\an8}Either you [bleep] with me, or
you defending that [bleep].

40:08.773 --> 40:10.407
{\an8}How I feel right now...

40:10.474 --> 40:11.175
{\an8}Uh huh.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.243
{\an8}I do not like you.

40:12.309 --> 40:13.477
{\an8}I'm the mother.

40:13.544 --> 40:17.081
{\an8}I started the root of this, so
you have to understand that.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.183
{\an8}Who is Masika?

40:19.250 --> 40:20.451
{\an8}Um, well you
know, she's a friend.

40:20.518 --> 40:21.485
{\an8}It never went that far.

40:21.552 --> 40:22.353
{\an8}You guys never had sex?

40:22.419 --> 40:23.187
{\an8}No.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.054
{\an8}So where do you guys stand now?

40:24.121 --> 40:24.822
{\an8}We're done.

40:24.889 --> 40:25.990
{\an8}I adore you.

40:26.056 --> 40:27.258
{\an8}You're my boo.

40:27.324 --> 40:34.365
{\an8}I am emotionally exhausted
because I love my son more

40:34.431 --> 40:36.100
{\an8}than anything on the planet.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.902
{\an8}There's no erasing my
baby momma out of my life.

40:37.968 --> 40:38.569
{\an8}Right.

40:38.636 --> 40:39.770
{\an8}So you have to deal with it.

40:39.837 --> 40:40.538
{\an8}But don't you feel like you
kind of gotta be the

40:40.604 --> 40:41.338
{\an8}one to communicate?

40:41.405 --> 40:43.440
{\an8}Yes, it's my place.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.643
{\an8}You had a party going on.

40:45.709 --> 40:46.844
{\an8}You keep saying the same
thing over and over again.

40:46.911 --> 40:48.512
{\an8}Because you're not listening.

40:48.579 --> 40:49.780
{\an8}How can I tell you about a
surprise party that

40:49.847 --> 40:50.614
{\an8}I didn't know about.

40:50.681 --> 40:52.850
{\an8}Negative energy Nia, get away.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.352
{\an8}Every time I bring up Berg, like
girl, that doesn't equate to

40:55.419 --> 40:57.054
{\an8}what happened with me and Ray.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.522
{\an8}It's not a relationship.

40:58.589 --> 40:59.790
{\an8}You can't rap.

40:59.857 --> 41:02.593
{\an8}You don't know shit about music
but you're still steady trying

41:02.660 --> 41:04.261
{\an8}at 30-[bleep]-4-years-old.

41:04.328 --> 41:05.963
{\an8}And that's why the
[bleep] I'm out.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.531
{\an8}Come see me if you want to.

41:07.598 --> 41:08.399
{\an8}Come see me.

41:08.465 --> 41:09.600
{\an8}What up?
